The problem statement provides a set of specific approximations to construct a simplified model. We shall proceed by validating the problem and then constructing the solution based on these approximations.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted:\n- A long, solid, isotropic, linear-elastic cylinder of radius $a$.\n- Initial state: zero concentration, zero stress.\n- Boundary condition: surface concentration fixed at $c_s$ for $t > 0$ at $r=a$.\n- Material constants: Young's modulus $E$, Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, diffusion coefficient $D$, chemical expansion coefficient $\\beta$.\n- Eigenstrain law: $\\varepsilon^{*}(c) = \\beta c$.\n- Approximations for short time $t$:\n    1.  The near-surface geometry is a flat half-space.\n    2.  The concentration profile is a sharp front: $c \\approx c_s$ in a surface layer of thickness $\\delta$ and $c \\approx 0$ in the substrate, where $\\delta \\sim \\sqrt{Dt}$.\n    3.  Generalized plane strain applies.\n    4.  Hoop stress is approximately equi-biaxial in the surface layer.\n    5.  The compressive force in the surface layer is balanced by a tensile force in the substrate over a depth comparable to $\\delta$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the theory of solid mechanics and diffusion (chemo-mechanics). It describes the well-known phenomenon of diffusion-induced stress. The terminology is precise and objective. The provided approximations, while simplifying, are physically motivated for the short-time regime and create a well-posed problem within the context of this simplified model. All necessary information is provided. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nWe model the near-surface region as a flat bilayer system. We use a coordinate $z$ pointing into the material from the surface, so $z=0$ corresponds to $r=a$ and the diffusion front is at $z=\\delta$.\n\n1.  **Constitutive Relations**:\n    The total strain tensor $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the sum of the elastic strain $\\varepsilon_{ij}^e$ and the chemical eigenstrain $\\varepsilon_{ij}^*$: $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ij}^e + \\varepsilon_{ij}^*$.\n    The eigenstrain is isotropic, $\\varepsilon_{ij}^* = \\varepsilon^* \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\varepsilon^* = \\beta c$.\n    Hooke's law relates stress $\\sigma_{ij}$ to elastic strain. For an isotropic material under biaxial stress where $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma$ and all other stress components are zero (a local approximation for the surface based on the equi-biaxial hoop and axial stress assumption, $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} \\approx \\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma$, and the traction-free surface condition $\\sigma_{rr} \\approx 0$), the in-plane elastic strains are $\\varepsilon_{xx}^e = \\varepsilon_{yy}^e = \\frac{1-\\nu}{E}\\sigma$.\n\n2.  **Model Setup**:\n    - **Surface Layer ($0 \\le z < \\delta$)**: The concentration is $c_s$, so the eigenstrain is $\\varepsilon^* = \\beta c_s$. The in-plane stress is a uniform, compressive, biaxial stress, which we denote as $\\sigma_s$.\n    - **Substrate ($z > \\delta$)**: The concentration is $0$, so the eigenstrain is $\\varepsilon^* = 0$. This region experiences a tensile stress to balance the compression in the layer above. The maximum tensile stress, $\\sigma_t$, occurs at the interface $z=\\delta$.\n\n3.  **Kinematic Compatibility**:\n    The total in-plane strain, $\\varepsilon_{||}$, must be continuous across the diffusion front at $z = \\delta$.\n    Just inside the surface layer (at $z=\\delta^-$):\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{||}(\\delta^-) = \\varepsilon_{||}^e + \\varepsilon_{||}^* = \\frac{1-\\nu}{E}\\sigma_s + \\beta c_s $$\n    Just inside the substrate (at $z=\\delta^+$):\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{||}(\\delta^+) = \\varepsilon_{||}^e + \\varepsilon_{||}^* = \\frac{1-\\nu}{E}\\sigma_t + 0 $$\n    Equating the total strains, $\\varepsilon_{||}(\\delta^-) = \\varepsilon_{||}(\\delta^+)$, yields a relationship between the stress just above and just below the front:\n    $$ \\frac{1-\\nu}{E}\\sigma_s + \\beta c_s = \\frac{1-\\nu}{E}\\sigma_t $$\n    Rearranging gives the jump in stress across the front:\n    $$ \\sigma_t - \\sigma_s = \\frac{E \\beta c_s}{1-\\nu} \\quad (1) $$\n\n4.  **Mechanical Equilibrium**:\n    The cylinder is free of external loads, so the net force on any cross-section must be zero. This means the total compressive force in the surface layer must be balanced by the total tensile force in the substrate.\n    The problem statement guides this calculation by asserting that \"subsurface tensile stress self-equilibrates the surface-layer compression\" over a depth \"comparable to $\\delta$\". This is a strong instruction to model the force balance as an interaction between two effective layers of equal thickness $\\delta$.\n    - The compressive force per unit length of circumference in the surface layer is $F_s = \\sigma_s \\delta$.\n    - We approximate the integrated tensile force in the substrate by modeling it as a layer of thickness $\\delta$ with a representative stress $\\sigma_t$. The tensile force per unit length is thus $F_t \\approx \\sigma_t \\delta$.\n    The zero-net-force condition is $F_s + F_t = 0$:\n    $$ \\sigma_s \\delta + \\sigma_t \\delta = 0 $$\n    This simplifies to a direct relationship between the stresses:\n    $$ \\sigma_s = -\\sigma_t \\quad (2) $$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Tensile Stress**:\n    We have a system of two linear equations, (1) and (2), for the two unknown stresses $\\sigma_s$ and $\\sigma_t$. We seek $\\sigma_t$, the maximum tensile stress at the front.\n    Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):\n    $$ \\sigma_t - (-\\sigma_t) = \\frac{E \\beta c_s}{1-\\nu} $$\n    $$ 2\\sigma_t = \\frac{E \\beta c_s}{1-\\nu} $$\n    Solving for $\\sigma_t$ gives the estimated maximum hoop tensile stress:\n    $$ \\sigma_t = \\frac{E \\beta c_s}{2(1-\\nu)} $$\n    This stress, $\\sigma_t$, is the biaxial tensile stress ($\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\sigma_{zz}$) in the substrate immediately adjacent to the diffusion front.

The problem is a standard exercise in applying principles of mass transport to a materials science problem, specifically hydrogen embrittlement. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from mass conservation and Fick's law. For steady-state diffusion, the mass conservation equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the hydrogen flux vector. The problem specifies a two-dimensional radial transport scenario in the plane normal to the crack front. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, assuming angular symmetry, this equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}(r J_r) = 0\n$$\nwhere $J_r$ is the radial component of the flux.

Thus, the radial flux has the form:\n$$\nJ_r(r) = \\frac{K_1}{r}\n$$\nThis result shows that the magnitude of the flux density is inversely proportional to the radial distance, as expected for radial conservation.\n\nFick's first law of diffusion relates the flux to the concentration gradient. In the absence of stress coupling, as specified, it is given by $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$, where $D$ is the constant diffusivity and $c$ is the hydrogen concentration. For our radial problem, this becomes:\n$$\nJ_r(r) = -D \\frac{dc}{dr}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $J_r(r)$:\n$$\n-D \\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{K_1}{r}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $c(r)$.

The negative sign correctly indicates that the diffusion is directed inward, toward the crack tip.\n\nThe next step is to find the total flux of hydrogen per unit crack-front length, which we denote as $Q_H$, flowing into the cohesive zone boundary at $r=a$. This is found by integrating the flux density over the sink's surface. Per unit length along the crack front, this surface is the circumference $2\\pi a$. The magnitude of the flux density at this boundary is $|J_r(a)|$.\n$$\n|J_r(a)| = \\left| - \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{a \\ln(R/a)} \\right| = \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{a \\ln(R/a)}\n$$\nThe total influx per unit length is then:\n$$\nQ_H = |J_r(a)| \\times (2\\pi a) = \\left( \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{a \\ln(R/a)} \\right) (2\\pi a)\n$$\n$$\nQ_H = \\frac{2 \\pi D c_{\\infty}}{\\ln(R/a)}\n$$\nThis is the steady-state supply rate of hydrogen to the cohesive zone per unit crack-front length.\n\nFinally, we apply the mass balance at the cohesive zone.
