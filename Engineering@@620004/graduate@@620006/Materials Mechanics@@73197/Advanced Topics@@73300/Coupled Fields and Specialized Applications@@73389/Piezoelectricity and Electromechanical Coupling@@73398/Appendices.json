The use of a $6mm$ point group is representative of common poled ferroelectric ceramics. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information and a clear objective for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The provided material constants are physically realistic for piezoelectric ceramics such as PZT (lead zirconate titanate).

However, this is not a fatal flaw. A competent physicist understands that the task is to derive relations between different sets of material coefficients, starting from the constitutive equations that contain the given coefficients. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires deriving expressions for the longitudinal piezoelectric strain coefficient $d_{33}$ and the permittivity at constant stress $\\epsilon^{T}_{33}$ in terms of the given material properties: the elastic stiffness at constant electric field $c^{E}_{33}$, the piezoelectric stress coefficient $e_{33}$, and the permittivity at constant strain $\\epsilon^{S}_{33}$.\n\nThe appropriate set of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, which uses the given coefficients and has strain $S$ and electric field $E$ as independent variables, is the stress-charge form. For a one-dimensional problem along the $3$-axis, these equations reduce to:\n$$T_3 = c^{E}_{33} S_3 - e_{33} E_3 \\quad\\quad (1)$$\n$$D_3 = e_{33} S_3 + \\epsilon^{S}_{33} E_3 \\quad\\quad (2)$$\nwhere $T_3$ is the longitudinal stress, $S_3$ is the longitudinal strain, $E_3$ is the applied electric field, and $D_3$ is the resulting electric displacement.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the piezoelectric strain coefficient $d_{33}$. By definition, $d_{33}$ represents the strain generated per unit electric field under the condition of zero stress.\n$$d_{33} \\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\partial S_3}{\\partial E_3} \\right)_{T_3=0}$$\nThe problem specifies a free-mounted condition, which is precisely $T_3=0$. We apply this condition to equation (1):\n$$0 = c^{E}_{33} S_3 - e_{33} E_3$$\nSolving for the strain $S_3$ as a function of the electric field $E_3$:\n$$c^{E}_{33} S_3 = e_{33} E_3$$\n$$S_3 = \\frac{e_{33}}{c^{E}_{33}} E_3$$\nNow, we can compute the derivative according to the definition of $d_{33}$:\n$$d_{33} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_3} \\left( \\frac{e_{33}}{c^{E}_{33}} E_3 \\right) = \\frac{e_{33}}{c^{E}_{33}}$$\nThis is the first required analytical expression.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the permittivity at constant stress, $\\epsilon^{T}_{33}$. By definition, this coefficient represents the electric displacement per unit electric field, also under the condition of zero stress.\n$$\\epsilon^{T}_{33} \\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\partial D_3}{\\partial E_3} \\right)_{T_3=0}$$\nTo evaluate this, we must first express $D_3$ as a function of only $E_3$ when $T_3=0$. We start with equation (2):\n$$D_3 = e_{33} S_3 + \\epsilon^{S}_{33} E_3$$\nWe must substitute the expression for $S_3$ under zero stress conditions, which we previously found to be $S_3 = (e_{33}/c^{E}_{33}) E_3$. Substituting this into the equation for $D_3$:\n$$D_3 = e_{33} \\left( \\frac{e_{33}}{c^{E}_{33}} E_3 \\right) + \\epsilon^{S}_{33} E_3$$\n$$D_3 = \\left( \\frac{e_{33}^2}{c^{E}_{33}} + \\epsilon^{S}_{33} \\right) E_3$$\nTaking the derivative with respect to $E_3$ gives the desired coefficient:\n$$\\epsilon^{T}_{33} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_3} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{e_{33}^2}{c^{E}_{33}} + \\epsilon^{S}_{33} \\right) E_3 \\right] = \\epsilon^{S}_{33} + \\frac{e_{33}^2}{c^{E}_{33}}$$\nThis is the second required analytical expression. This result also reveals the physical meaning of the superscripts $S$ and $T$: $\\epsilon^T$ is the permittivity measured on a mechanically free sample ($T=0$), while $\\epsilon^S$ is measured on a clamped sample ($S=0$). The difference, $e_{33}^2/c_{33}^E$, represents the additional contribution to permittivity from the piezoelectric-mechanical coupling.\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical evaluation using the provided data, ensuring all values are in SI base units.\n- $c^{E}_{33} = 127\\,\\text{GPa} = 127 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$\n- $e_{33} = 17.3\\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$\n- $\\epsilon^{S}_{33} = 1.05 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nEvaluation of $d_{33}$:\n$$d_{33} = \\frac{e_{33}}{c^{E}_{33}} = \\frac{17.3}{127 \\times 10^9} \\, \\text{C}\\,\\text{N}^{-1}$$\n$$d_{33} \\approx 1.3622047 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{N}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in picocoulombs per newton ($\\text{pC}\\,\\text{N}^{-1}$), where $1\\,\\text{pC} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{C}$.\n$$d_{33} \\approx 136.22047 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{N}^{-1} = 136.22047\\,\\text{pC}\\,\\text{N}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $d_{33} = 136.2\\,\\text{pC}\\,\\text{N}^{-1}$.\n\nEvaluation of $\\epsilon^{T}_{33}$:\n$$\\epsilon^{T}_{33} = \\epsilon^{S}_{33} + \\frac{e_{33}^2}{c^{E}_{33}} = (1.05 \\times 10^{-8}) + \\frac{(17.3)^2}{127 \\times 10^9} \\, \\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nFirst, calculate the second term:\n$$\\frac{e_{33}^2}{c^{E}_{33}} = \\frac{299.29}{127 \\times 10^9} \\approx 2.356614 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nNow, add this to $\\epsilon^{S}_{33}$:\n$$\\epsilon^{T}_{33} \\approx (1.05 \\times 10^{-8}) + (0.2356614 \\times 10^{-8}) \\, \\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\n$$\\epsilon^{T}_{33} \\approx 1.2856614 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanofarads per meter ($\\text{nF}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$), where $1\\,\\text{nF} = 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}$.\n$$\\epsilon^{T}_{33} \\approx 12.856614 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} = 12.856614\\,\\text{nF}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $\\epsilon^{T}_{33} = 12.86\\,\\text{nF}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of numerical values $\\left(d_{33},\\ \\epsilon^{T}_{33}\\right)$ presented as a row vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n136.2 & 12.86\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2907832"}, {"introduction": "To effectively compare piezoelectric materials or assess their suitability for applications like sensors and energy harvesters, we need a dimensionless figure of merit.

This factor quantifies the efficiency of energy conversion between mechanical and electrical domains in a quasistatic process. The derivation must start from the fundamental one-dimensional linear constitutive relations of piezoelectricity and concepts of energy density.\n\nThe specified constitutive relations in the strain-charge formulation, where axial stress $T_3$ and axial electric field $E_3$ are the independent variables, relate the axial strain $S_3$ and axial electric displacement $D_3$ as follows:\n$$ S_3 = s_{33}^{E} T_3 + d_{33} E_3 $$\n$$ D_3 = d_{33} T_3 + \\epsilon_{33}^{T} E_3 $$\nHere, $s_{33}^{E}$ is the elastic compliance at constant electric field, $d_{33}$ is the piezoelectric coefficient, and $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$ is the dielectric permittivity at constant stress.\n\nTo derive $k_{33}$ as an energy conversion ratio, as requested by the problem statement, we must analyze a specific quasistatic thermodynamic cycle. Let us consider a process where mechanical energy is supplied to the system, and we determine the maximum fraction of this energy that is reversibly converted into electrical energy.\n\nStep 1: Mechanical energy input under short-circuit conditions ($E_3=0$).\nThe nanowire is subjected to an axial stress $T_3$ while its electrical terminals are short-circuited, which enforces the condition $E_3 = 0$. The input work done on the system per unit volume, which is stored as elastic energy density $U_{in}$, is given by the integral:\n$$ U_{in} = \\int_{0}^{S_3} T'_3 dS'_3 $$\nUnder the condition $E_3=0$, the constitutive relation for strain simplifies to $S_3 = s_{33}^{E} T_3$. From this, the differential strain is $dS_3 = s_{33}^E dT_3$. Substituting this into the integral and changing the integration variable from $S'_3$ to $T'_3$ yields:\n$$ U_{in} = \\int_{0}^{T_3} T'_3 (s_{33}^E dT'_3) = \\frac{1}{2} s_{33}^E T_3^2 $$\nAt the end of this step, the material has stored an elastic energy density of $U_{in}$, reached a strain of $S_3 = s_{33}^E T_3$, and developed an induced electric displacement of $D_3 = d_{33} T_3$ (since $E_3$ was held at $0$).\n\nStep 2: Energy conversion under open-circuit conditions ($dD_3=0$).\nNext, the nanowire is electrically isolated, which corresponds to an open-circuit condition. This means no charge can flow, and the electric displacement $D_3$ must remain constant at the value it attained in Step 1, which is $D_3 = d_{33} T_3$. Following this isolation, the applied stress is quasistatically reduced to zero. As the stress is reduced, an internal electric field must develop to maintain the constant electric displacement.\nFrom the second constitutive relation, $D_3 = d_{33} T'_3 + \\epsilon_{33}^T E'_3$, where $T'_3$ and $E'_3$ are the stress and field during this step. We enforce the condition that the electric displacement remains constant at its initial value, $D_3 = d_{33} T_3$. When the external stress is fully removed ($T'_3=0$), the final generated electric field, $E_{3,f}$, is found from:\n$$ d_{33} T_3 = d_{33}(0) + \\epsilon_{33}^T E_{3,f} \\implies E_{3,f} = \\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^T} T_3 $$\nThe electrical energy density stored in the material at this final state is the portion of the initial energy that has been converted, denoted as $U_{conv}$. This energy is calculated as:\n$$ U_{conv} = \\frac{1}{2} D_3 E_{3,f} = \\frac{1}{2} (d_{33} T_3) \\left(\\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^T} T_3 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d_{33}^2}{\\epsilon_{33}^T} T_3^2 $$\nThis quantity represents the maximum electrical energy that can be extracted from the mechanical energy that was initially supplied.\n\nThe squared electromechanical coupling factor, $k_{33}^2$, is precisely defined as this ratio of the maximum convertible energy to the total input energy for this idealized cycle:\n$$ k_{33}^2 = \\frac{U_{conv}}{U_{in}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d_{33}^2}{\\epsilon_{33}^T} T_3^2}{\\frac{1}{2} s_{33}^E T_3^2} = \\frac{d_{33}^2}{s_{33}^E \\epsilon_{33}^T} $$\nTherefore, the electromechanical coupling factor $k_{33}$ is the positive square root of this expression:\n$$ k_{33} = \\frac{|d_{33}|}{\\sqrt{s_{33}^E \\epsilon_{33}^T}} $$\nThis dimensionless quantity is a crucial figure of merit for piezoelectric materials. Its square, $k_{33}^2$, is physically interpretable as the maximum theoretical efficiency for energy conversion in the uniaxial quasistatic limit. A fundamental thermodynamic stability criterion requires that material properties such as elastic compliance under open-circuit conditions, $s_{33}^D = s_{33}^E - d_{33}^2/\\epsilon_{33}^T = s_{33}^E (1 - k_{33}^2)$, must be positive. This imposes the strict inequality $k_{33}^2 < 1$, confirming that perfect energy conversion is physically impossible. For nanoscale devices like the ZnO nanowire in this problem, which are candidates for nanogenerators, sensors, and actuators, a high value of $k_{33}$ is paramount for maximizing the device's transduction performance.\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical evaluation using the given material parameters: $d_{33}=1.20 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m/V}$, $s_{33}^{E}=7.00 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/N}$, and $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}=7.50 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$.\nWe first compute $k_{33}^2$:\n$$ k_{33}^2 = \\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{-11})^2}{(7.00 \\times 10^{-12}) (7.50 \\times 10^{-11})} = \\frac{1.44 \\times 10^{-22}}{5.25 \\times 10^{-22}} \\approx 0.2742857 $$\nThen, we take the square root to find $k_{33}$:\n$$ k_{33} = \\sqrt{0.2742857...} \\approx 0.523723 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as required gives $0.524$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.524}$$", "id": "2783901"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical coefficients that define piezoelectric behavior are ultimately determined through experimental measurement.

Substituting this into the equation of motion ($3$) yields the wave equation:\n    $$ c^E_{33} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_3}{\\partial z^2} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_3}{\\partial t^2} $$\n    This equation describes a mechanical wave with propagation velocity $v_E = \\sqrt{c^E_{33}/\\rho}$.\n    The plate has mechanically free faces, meaning $T_3=0$ at $z=\\pm t/2$. The fundamental resonance mode corresponds to a standing wave where the thickness is half a wavelength, $t = \\lambda_r/2$.\n    Using the wave relation $\\lambda_r f_r = v_E$, we have $t = v_E / (2f_r)$.\n    $$ 2 t f_r = v_E = \\sqrt{\\frac{c^E_{33}}{\\rho}} \\implies c^E_{33} = \\rho (2 t f_r)^2 $$\n\n3.  **Open-Circuit Antiresonance and $c^D_{33}$**:\n    Open-circuit conditions imply no net current flow, which for a capacitor corresponds to constant charge on the electrodes. For the bulk of the material, this is modeled as zero electric displacement, $D_3=0$. From equation ($2$):\n    $$ 0 = e_{33} S_3 + \\epsilon^S_{33} E_3 \\implies E_3 = -\\frac{e_{33}}{\\epsilon^S_{33}} S_3 $$\n    Substituting this into equation ($1$):\n    $$ T_3 = c^E_{33} S_3 - e_{33} \\left(-\\frac{e_{33}}{\\epsilon^S_{33}} S_3\\right) = \\left(c^E_{33} + \\frac{e_{33}^2}{\\epsilon^S_{33}}\\right) S_3 $$\n    We define the stiffened elastic constant at constant electric displacement, $c^D_{33}$, as:\n    $$ c^D_{33} = c^E_{33} + \\frac{e_{33}^2}{\\epsilon^S_{33}} $$\n    The stress is now $T_3 = c^D_{33} S_3$. The wave equation becomes $c^D_{33} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_3}{\\partial z^2} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_3}{\\partial t^2}$, with wave velocity $v_D = \\sqrt{c^D_{33}/\\rho}$.\n    The mechanical boundary conditions are unchanged ($T_3=0$ at $z=\\pm t/2$). The fundamental mode frequency, now called the antiresonance frequency $f_a$, again corresponds to a half-wavelength resonance: $t = \\lambda_a/2 = v_D/(2f_a)$.\n    $$ 2 t f_a = v_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{c^D_{33}}{\\rho}} \\implies c^D_{33} = \\rho (2 t f_a)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Piezoelectric Coefficient $e_{33}$**:\n    From the definition of $c^D_{33}$, we can solve for $e_{33}$:\n    $$ c^D_{33} - c^E_{33} = \\frac{e_{33}^2}{\\epsilon^S_{33}} \\implies e_{33} = \\sqrt{(c^D_{33} - c^E_{33}) \\epsilon^S_{33}} $$\n    The sign of $e_{33}$ is not determined by this method, but its magnitude is.\n\n5.  **Mechanical Quality Factor $Q$**:\n    The quality factor $Q$ of a resonator is defined as the ratio of the resonant frequency to the half-power ($3$ dB) bandwidth. The problem states that the half-power frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ are measured around the *short-circuit resonance peak*. This resonance occurs at $f_r$. Therefore, the correct expression for $Q$ is:\n    $$ Q = \\frac{f_r}{f_2 - f_1} $$\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n- **Option A**:\n    - Compute $\\epsilon^S_{33}$ from $C_b$ via $\\epsilon^S_{33} = C_b\\, t/A$. **Correct**, as derived above.\n    - Compute $c^E_{33}$ from $f_r$ via $c^E_{33} = \\rho\\, (2 t f_r)^2$. **Correct**, as derived above.\n    - Compute $c^D_{33}$ from $f_a$ via $c^D_{33} = \\rho\\, (2 t f_a)^2$. **Correct**, as derived above.\n    - Compute $e_{33}$ via $e_{33} = \\sqrt{(c^D_{33}-c^E_{33})\\,\\epsilon^S_{33}}$. **Correct**, as derived above.\n    - Compute $Q$ via $Q = f_r/(f_2 - f_1)$. **Correct**, based on the definition of $Q$ and the context of the measurement.\n    All steps in this option are consistent with the derivation from first principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **Option B**:\n    - $\\epsilon^S_{33} = C_b\\, A/t$: **Incorrect**. This is dimensionally wrong. The correct formula is $\\epsilon^S_{33} = C_b t/A$.\n    - $c^E_{33} = \\rho\\, (\\pi t f_r)^2$: **Incorrect**. The factor is $2$, not $\\pi$. The fundamental mode has a wavelength $\\lambda = 2t$, not $\\lambda = 2\\pi t / \\text{something}$.\n    - $c^D_{33} = \\rho\\, (\\pi t f_a)^2$: **Incorrect**. Same reason as for $c^E_{33}$.\n    - $e_{33} = \\sqrt{(c^E_{33}-c^D_{33})\\,\\epsilon^S_{33}}$: **Incorrect**. Since $f_a > f_r$, it follows that $c^D_{33} > c^E_{33}$. The term $c^E_{33}-c^D_{33}$ is negative, leading to an imaginary $e_{33}$, which is unphysical. The relationship is $c^D_{33}-c^E_{33} = e_{33}^2/\\epsilon^S_{33}$.\n    - $Q = (f_2 - f_1)/f_r$: **Incorrect**. This is the inverse of the quality factor.\n    This option is riddled with fundamental errors.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option C**:\n    - $c^E_{33} = \\rho\\, (2 t f_a)^2$: **Incorrect**. This expression is for $c^D_{33}$. It incorrectly associates the constant-field stiffness with the open-circuit antiresonance frequency.\n    - $c^D_{33} = \\rho\\, (2 t f_r)^2$: **Incorrect**. This expression is for $c^E_{33}$. It incorrectly associates the constant-displacement stiffness with the short-circuit resonance frequency.\n    - $e_{33} = \\sqrt{(c^D_{33}-c^E_{33})\\,\\epsilon^T_{33}}$: **Incorrect**. The relation involves $\\epsilon^S_{33}$, not $\\epsilon^T_{33}$ (permittivity at constant stress). Furthermore, it estimates $\\epsilon^T_{33}$ using the measurement for $\\epsilon^S_{33}$. This is wrong on multiple levels.\n    - $Q = f_a/(f_2 - f_1)$: **Incorrect**. The problem states that $f_1$ and $f_2$ bracket the *short-circuit* resonance peak ($f_r$), not the antiresonance peak ($f_a$).\n    This option confuses the physical meaning of resonance and antiresonance.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option D**:\n    - $c^E_{33} = \\rho\\, (2 t f_r)^2$: **Correct**.\n    - The procedure for $e_{33}$ is flawed. It uses $k_t^2 = e_{33}^2/(c^D_{33}\\,\\epsilon^S_{33})$, which is a correct identity. However, it then proposes to calculate $c^D_{33}$ using the formula $c^D_{33} = \\rho\\, (2 t f_r)^2$. This is fundamentally **incorrect**; this formula is for $c^E_{33}$. The antiresonance frequency $f_a$ must be used to find $c^D_{33}$. Using $f_r$ makes the value of $c^D_{33}$ incorrect, and thus the resulting $e_{33}$ will be incorrect. This path is not consistent with first principles. The path in option A is direct and correct.\n    This option contains a critical error in its procedure.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only procedure that is fully consistent with the first principles of the one-dimensional model of piezoelectricity is presented in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2907790"}]}
