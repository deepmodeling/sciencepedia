Assume small strains, quasi-static conditions, and non-adhesive contact.

Your final numeric answer must be the single exact value of the ratio $p_{0}/p_{\\mathrm{avg}}$; no rounding instructions apply.", "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded in classical contact mechanics, and well-posed. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem describes the frictionless normal contact between a rigid sphere of radius $R$ and a linear elastic half-space, which is the classical Hertzian contact problem. We are to derive the pressure distribution and related properties starting from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the kinematic condition for contact. Let the origin of a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$ be at the center of the contact region on the undeformed surface of the half-space. The undeformed gap between the sphere and the plane is given by the parabolic approximation $z_{\\text{gap}}(r) = r^2 / (2R)$. When a compressive force $F$ is applied, the rigid sphere indents the half-space by a depth $\\delta$ at the center ($r=0$). The vertical position of a point on the sphere's surface is then $z_{\\text{sphere}}(r) = r^2/(2R) - \\delta$. The surface of the elastic half-space deforms downwards by an amount $u_z(r)$. For contact to be maintained over a circular area of radius $a$, the deformed surfaces must match for $0 \\le r \\le a$. That is, the position of the sphere surface must equal the position of the half-space surface. The half-space surface is at $z_{\\text{half-space}}(r) = -u_z(r)$.\nEquating these gives:\n$$ -u_z(r) = \\frac{r^2}{2R} - \\delta $$\nThis provides the required shape of the elastic surface displacement within the contact region:\n$$ u_z(r) = \\delta - \\frac{r^2}{2R} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le r \\le a $$\nThe displacement profile is thus a paraboloid. We also note that at the edge of the contact, $r=a$, the displacement is $u_z(a) = \\delta - a^2/(2R)$.\n\nThe problem requires us to use the relation between surface pressure $p(r)$ and surface displacement $u_z(r)$ for an elastic half-space. It is a known result from the theory of elasticity that a surface displacement of the form $u_z(r) = C_1 + C_2 r^2$ inside a circular region of radius $a$ is produced by a semi-ellipsoidal pressure distribution of the form:\n$$ p(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} $$\nwhere $p_0$ is the maximum pressure at the center ($r=0$). This is the functional form of the contact pressure required by the problem. This solution satisfies the boundary condition that pressure must vanish at the edge of the contact, $p(a)=0$.\n\nThe displacement produced by this pressure distribution is also a standard result, given by:\n$$ u_z(r) = \\frac{\\pi a p_0}{2E^*} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}\\right) $$\nwhere $E^*$ is the effective modulus of the half-space.\n\nWe now enforce the kinematic compatibility by equating the two expressions for $u_z(r)$:\n$$ \\delta - \\frac{r^2}{2R} = \\frac{\\pi a p_0}{2E^*} - \\frac{\\pi p_0 r^2}{4E^* a} $$\nFor this equation to hold for all $r \\in [0, a]$, we must match the constant terms and the coefficients of the $r^2$ terms independently.\nMatching the constant terms gives the relation for the indentation depth $\\delta$:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{\\pi a p_0}{2E^*} $$\nMatching the coefficients of the $r^2$ terms gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2R} = \\frac{\\pi p_0}{4E^* a} $$\nFrom this second relation, we can express the maximum pressure $p_0$ as:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{2 E^* a}{\\pi R} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\delta$ yields the geometric relation $\\delta = a^2/R$.\n\nNext, to relate these quantities to the total applied force $F$, we perform a global force equilibrium. The total force is the integral of the pressure distribution over the contact area:\n$$ F = \\int_{\\text{Area}} p(r) \\, dA = \\int_0^a p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} \\cdot 2\\pi r \\, dr $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the substitution $x = 1 - (r/a)^2$, for which $dx = -2r/a^2 \\, dr$. The limits of integration change from $r=0 \\to x=1$ and $r=a \\to x=0$.\n$$ F = 2\\pi p_0 \\int_1^0 \\sqrt{x} \\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2}\\right) dx = \\pi p_0 a^2 \\int_0^1 x^{1/2} \\, dx $$\n$$ F = \\pi p_0 a^2 \\left[ \\frac{2}{3} x^{3/2} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi p_0 a^2 $$\nThis equation provides the relationship between the total force $F$, the maximum pressure $p_0$, and the contact radius $a$. This completes the derivation of the relations requested by the problem.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the ratio of the maximum pressure $p_0$ to the mean pressure $p_{\\text{avg}}$. The mean pressure is defined as the total force divided by the contact area:\n$$ p_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{F}{\\pi a^2} $$\nFrom our force equilibrium result, $F = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi p_0 a^2$, we can express the maximum pressure $p_0$ in terms of $F$ and $a$:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{3F}{2\\pi a^2} $$\nNow we can form the required ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_0}{p_{\\text{avg}}} = \\frac{\\frac{3F}{2\\pi a^2}}{\\frac{F}{\\pi a^2}} = \\frac{3}{2} $$\nThe value of the ratio is exactly $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nRegarding the effect of adhesion, the boundary conditions at the contact edge change significantly. The non-adhesive Hertzian model assumes that the only interaction is compressive force, and thus $p(r) \\ge 0$ everywhere, with $p(a)=0$.\nThe Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) model, valid for compliant systems with strong short-range adhesion, postulates that adhesive forces act only within the contact area $r \\le a$. This alters the mechanics such that a tensile stress singularity develops at the contact edge, i.e., $p(r) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to a^-$. This infinite tension represents the strong adhesive forces holding the contact edge together. The model predicts a larger contact area for a given load and the existence of a finite negative \"pull-off\" force required to separate the surfaces.\nThe Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) model, valid for stiff systems with weaker long-range adhesion, assumes that the stress distribution within the contact area $r \\le a$ remains Hertzian in form ($p(r) \\propto \\sqrt{1-(r/a)^2}$ and $p(a)=0$). However, it includes the effect of attractive forces acting *outside* the contact area ($r > a$). These forces act in addition to the externally applied load $F$, effectively increasing the total compressive load on the contact. This also leads to a larger contact radius than the Hertz model for a given applied load $F$ and a non-zero pull-off force.\nBoth JKR and DMT models retain the same kinematic assumption derived from the parabolic gap approximation within the contact area.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2888405"}, {"introduction": "The world of adhesive contact is spanned by different models, from the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) to the Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) limit.

The parameters provided ($R$, $w$, $E^\\ast$, $z_0$) are the standard physical quantities that govern this phenomenon. The goal of data collapse using dimensional analysis is a cornerstone of experimental physics and engineering. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The question asks for the \"most appropriate\" set of dimensionless groups to achieve a well-defined physical objective (data collapse for a specific class of phenomena). A unique set of controlling dimensionless parameters exists for this physical system, making the problem well-posed.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from the field of mechanics. It is free from ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe problem concerns the interplay of elastic deformation, surface adhesion, and geometry under an external load. The relevant physical quantities and their dimensions (in a Force-Length system, $[F], [L]$) are:\n-   Normal Load, $F$: $[F]$\n-   Contact Radius, $a$: $[L]$\n-   Sphere Radius, $R$: $[L]$\n-   Elastic Modulus, $E^\\ast$: $[F]/[L]^2$\n-   Work of Adhesion, $w$: $[F][L]/[L]^2 = [F]/[L]$\n-   Range of Surface Forces, $z_0$: $[L]$\n-   Coefficient of Friction, $\\mu$: Dimensionless\n\nThe Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem indicates that from these $6$ physical quantities with $2$ fundamental dimensions, we can form $6-2=4$ independent dimensionless groups. We seek a set that describes the relationship $f(F, a, R, E^\\ast, w, z_0) = 0$, along with the friction parameter $\\mu$.\n\nThe central goal is to unify the JKR and DMT models. These two models represent opposing limits:\n-   **JKR model**: Assumes adhesive forces are infinitely short-ranged and act only within the contact area. It is appropriate for compliant systems with strong adhesion. Here, elastic deformation stores significant energy.\n-   **DMT model**: Assumes the contact profile remains Hertzian and that adhesive forces act outside the contact area, over a range governed by $z_0$. It is appropriate for stiff systems with weak adhesion.\n\nA single parameter must describe the transition between these two regimes. This is the **Tabor parameter**, $\\mu$. It compares the magnitude of the elastic deformation induced by adhesion to the range of action of the surface forces, $z_0$. The elastic deformation at the contact edge due to adhesion scales with the elasto-adhesive length, $\\delta_e \\propto (w^2 R / E^{*2})^{1/3}$. Therefore, the Tabor parameter is defined as:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{\\delta_e}{z_0} \\propto \\left( \\frac{w^2 R}{E^{*2}} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{1}{z_0} = \\left( \\frac{R w^2}{E^{\\ast 2} z_0^3} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nThis parameter correctly distinguishes the regimes: $\\mu \\gg 1$ corresponds to the JKR limit, and $\\mu \\ll 1$ corresponds to the DMT limit. The Maugis-Dugdale model provides a continuous transition between the two, parameterized by $\\mu$.\n\nNext, we must non-dimensionalize the measured observables, $F$ and $a$. The normalization factors must be constructed from the fundamental parameters of the problem ($R$, $w$, $E^\\ast$).\nThe characteristic force scale in adhesive contact is determined by the energy required to create new surfaces. The pull-off force in both JKR and DMT limits is proportional to $R w$. Specifically, $F_{c,DMT} = -2\\pi R w$ and $F_{c,JKR} = -\\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w$. A natural and universal force scale is thus $\\pi R w$. The dimensionless force is then:\n$$ \\hat{F} = \\frac{F}{\\pi R w} $$\nThe characteristic length scale for the contact radius should incorporate both adhesion and elasticity. In the JKR model, the contact radius at zero applied load is $a(F=0) = (6 \\pi R^2 w/E^\\ast)^{1/3}$. This suggests a characteristic adhesive contact radius, $a_0$, built from $R$, $w$, and $E^\\ast$:\n$$ a_0 \\propto \\left(\\frac{R^2 w}{E^\\ast}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nNormalizing the measured contact radius by this scale gives the dimensionless contact radius:\n$$ \\hat{a} = \\frac{a}{a_0} $$\nWith these definitions, the relationship between normal load and contact size can be expressed as a universal function $\\hat{F} = g(\\hat{a}, \\mu)$. Plotting $\\hat{F}$ versus $\\hat{a}$ for various experiments should collapse the data onto a family of master curves, with each curve corresponding to a specific value of $\\mu$.\n\nFinally, the problem includes friction, characterized by the coefficient of friction $\\mu$. By its definition ($F_{friction} = \\mu F_{normal}$), $\\mu$ is already a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the ratio of tangential to normal force at sliding incipient. In the context of creating a comprehensive set of dimensionless groups, it is included as is.\n\nThus, the most appropriate set of dimensionless groups is {$\\hat{F} = F/(\\pi R w)$, $\\hat{a}=a/a_0$ with $a_0 \\propto (R^2 w/E^\\ast)^{1/3}$, $\\mu \\propto (R w^2/(E^{\\ast 2} z_0^3))^{1/3}$, $\\mu$}.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Use $\\hat{F}=F/(\\pi R w)$, $\\hat{a}=a/a_0$, the Tabor parameter $\\mu$, and the coefficient of friction $\\mu$, where $a_0$ is a characteristic adhesive contact radius built from $R$, $w$, and $E^\\ast$, and $\\mu$ compares elastic deformation at the adhesion scale to the surface-force range $z_0$ (for example, $a_0\\propto (R^2 w/E^\\ast)^{1/3}$ and $\\mu\\propto (R w^2/(E^{\\ast 2} z_0^3))^{1/3}$ up to numerical constants).**\nThis option presents the exact set of dimensionless groups derived from first principles.\n-   The force normalization $\\hat{F}=F/(\\pi R w)$ uses the correct adhesive force scale.\n-   The length normalization $\\hat{a}=a/a_0$ with $a_0\\propto (R^2 w/E^\\ast)^{1/3}$ uses the correct elasto-adhesive length scale.\n-   The Tabor parameter $\\mu\\propto (R w^2/(E^{\\ast 2} z_0^3))^{1/3}$ is the correct parameter governing the JKR-DMT transition.\n-   The inclusion of $\\mu$ is correct for characterizing friction.\nThis set of parameters is precisely that used in the Maugis-Dugdale transition theory, which is designed for the exact purpose described in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Use $F/(E^\\ast R^2)$, $a/R$, $w/(E^\\ast R)$, and $\\mu$, arguing that normalizing all forces and lengths by purely elastic Hertzian scales removes geometric effects and that explicit use of $z_0$ is unnecessary.**\nThis option contains several fundamental flaws.\n-   The argument that \"explicit use of $z_0$ is unnecessary\" is false. The parameter $z_0$ defines the range of surface forces and is essential for constructing the Tabor parameter, which distinguishes the DMT physics (long-range forces) from the JKR physics (infinitesimally short-range forces). Without $z_0$, one cannot construct the parameter that demarcates JKR-like versus DMT-like behavior.\n-   The normalization scales are based purely on Hertzian (non-adhesive) elasticity, such as $F/(E^\\ast R^2)$ and $a/R$. While valid for non-adhesive contact, they fail to properly scale the effects of adhesion, which is proportional to $w$. The goal is to collapse data where adhesion is a primary factor.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use $\\hat{F}=F/(E^\\ast a^2)$, $\\hat{a}=a/R$, $\\mu=w/(E^\\ast z_0)$, and $\\mu$, asserting that the elastic traction scale $E^\\ast$ over an area $a^2$ is the correct force scale and that the Tabor parameter is a simple ratio of adhesion energy density to elastic stress over the interaction range.**\nThis option is invalid for multiple reasons.\n-   The force normalization $\\hat{F}=F/(E^\\ast a^2)$ is methodologically unsound. It normalizes one measured variable, $F$, by another measured variable, $a$. This practice obscures the true relationship between $F$ and $a$ and often leads to trivial or spurious correlations. Normalization should be done with respect to constant system parameters ($R$, $w$, $E^\\ast$, $z_0$).\n-   The proposed Tabor parameter, $\\mu=w/(E^\\ast z_0)$, is incorrect. It lacks the dependence on the sphere radius $R$ and does not have the correct functional form derived from comparing elastic deformation to the force range. The correct Tabor parameter is $\\mu \\propto (R w^2/(E^{\\ast 2} z_0^3))^{1/3}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use $F/(w R^2)$, $a/a_0$, $\\mu=(E^\\ast z_0/(w R))^{1/3}$, and $\\mu E^\\ast$, arguing that the adhesive energy density $w$ combined with geometry provides a robust force scale and that friction should be rescaled by stiffness to collapse tangential data.**\nThis option is dimensionally inconsistent.\n-   The proposed dimensionless force, $F/(w R^2)$, is not dimensionless. The unit of force $F$ is $[F]$. The unit of work of adhesion $w$ is $[F]/[L]$. The unit of radius $R$ is $[L]$. Therefore, the unit of $w R^2$ is $([F]/[L]) \\cdot [L]^2 = [F][L]$, which is energy. The ratio $F/(w R^2)$ has units of $[F]/([F][L]) = 1/[L]$.\n-   The proposed Tabor parameter, $\\mu=(E^\\ast z_0/(w R))^{1/3}$, is not dimensionless. The unit of $E^\\ast z_0$ is $([F]/[L]^2) \\cdot [L] = [F]/[L]$. The unit of $w R$ is $([F]/[L]) \\cdot [L] = [F]$. The ratio $(E^\\ast z_0)/(w R)$ has units of $([F]/[L])/[F] = 1/[L]$. A cube root of this quantity is not dimensionless.\n-   The proposed friction group, $\\mu E^\\ast$, is not dimensionless.

An equilibrium state is stable if it corresponds to a local minimum of the potential energy, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^2 U_{total}}{\\partial z^2} > 0$. The loss of stability, which marks the onset of the snap-in phenomenon, occurs at the critical point where the curvature of the potential energy landscape vanishes, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^2 U_{total}}{\\partial z^2} = 0$.\n\nWe calculate the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 U_{total}}{\\partial z^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ -k_c(d-z) + \\frac{AR}{6z^2} \\right] = k_c + \\frac{AR}{6}(-2z^{-3}) = k_c - \\frac{AR}{3z^3}$$\nThe condition for the loss of stability is therefore:\n$$k_c - \\frac{AR}{3z^3} = 0$$\nThis is the required condition for the snap-in instability. It occurs when the cantilever stiffness $k_c$ is exactly balanced by the magnitude of the interaction stiffness, which is the gradient of the attractive force.\n\nUsing this instability condition, we can find the jump-in separation, denoted as $z_{\\mathrm{jump}}$, by solving for $z$:\n$$k_c = \\frac{AR}{3z_{\\mathrm{jump}}^3}$$\nRearranging the terms gives the closed-form expression for $z_{\\mathrm{jump}}$:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{jump}}^3 = \\frac{AR}{3k_c}$$\n$$z_{\\mathrm{jump}} = \\left( \\frac{AR}{3k_c} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the jump-in separation.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $z_{\\mathrm{jump}}$ using the provided data:\nCantilever stiffness: $k_c = 0.40 \\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\nTip radius: $R = 30 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 30 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\nHamaker constant: $A = 0.80 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\nSubstituting these SI unit values into our expression:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{jump}} = \\left( \\frac{(0.80 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J}) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m})}{3 \\times (0.40 \\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m^{-1}})} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n$$z_{\\mathrm{jump}} = \\left( \\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot m}}{1.2 \\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m^{-1}}} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nGiven that $1 \\ \\mathrm{J} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$, the units inside the parenthesis become $\\mathrm{m^3}$.\n$$z_{\\mathrm{jump}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{m^3})^{1/3} = (2.0)^{1/3} \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nWe calculate the cube root of $2$:\n$$(2.0)^{1/3} \\approx 1.259921$$\nSo, the jump-in separation is:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{jump}} \\approx 1.259921 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers ($1 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$z_{\\mathrm{jump}} \\approx 1.260 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.260}\n$$", "id": "2888409"}]}
