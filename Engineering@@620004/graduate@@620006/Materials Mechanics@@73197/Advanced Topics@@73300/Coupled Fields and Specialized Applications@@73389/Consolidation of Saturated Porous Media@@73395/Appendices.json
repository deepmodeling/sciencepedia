{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of geotechnical engineering is the ability to translate field observations into reliable model parameters. This practice challenges you to bridge theory and application by developing a complete data analysis workflow. Starting from settlement data measured over time, you will implement the classical Fourier series solution for one-dimensional consolidation and use non-linear least-squares optimization to estimate the fundamental soil properties $c_v$ and $m_v$, a crucial task for predicting the behavior of structures built on soft ground [@problem_id:2872105].", "problem": "You are asked to construct a principled estimator for the primary consolidation parameters of a saturated porous layer subjected to an embankment load, using measured surface settlement over time. The unknown parameters are the coefficient of consolidation $c_v$ (in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$) and the coefficient of volume compressibility $m_v$ (in $\\mathrm{Pa^{-1}}$). Your estimator must be derived from fundamental conservation principles and implemented as a non-linear least-squares fit to the observed settlement-time data.\n\nStart from the following physically grounded base:\n- One-dimensional mass conservation of the pore fluid in a saturated porous medium combined with Darcyâ€™s law, and the definition of compressibility, lead to a diffusion-type partial differential equation (PDE) for the excess pore pressure $u(z,t)$ of the form $\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c_v \\dfrac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$ for $z \\in [0,H_d]$, where $H_d$ is the drainage path length.\n- The initial condition is $u(z,0) = \\Delta \\sigma'$, where $\\Delta \\sigma'$ is the applied increment of vertical effective stress (assumed spatially uniform at $t=0^+$), and boundary conditions are drainage-dependent: for double drainage, symmetry and drainage at both faces imply two drained boundaries; for single drainage, there is one drained boundary and one no-flow boundary.\n- The layer thickness is $H$. For double drainage, use $H_d = H/2$. For single drainage, use $H_d = H$.\n- The average degree of consolidation $U(t)$ is defined as the spatial average of settlement progression under primary consolidation relative to final primary settlement, and depends on the time factor $T_v = c_v t / H_d^2$.\n- The primary settlement at time $t$ is $s(t) = S_f \\, U(t)$, with $S_f = m_v \\, \\Delta \\sigma' \\, H$.\n\nYour tasks:\n1. Derive, from the PDE and boundary-value problem, a computable expression for the average degree of consolidation $U(T_v)$ for primary consolidation that is valid for the drainage condition of each test case. You must not introduce any ad hoc shortcut or closed-form approximations that bypass the separation-of-variables solution; instead, implement the classical Fourier series for $U(T_v)$ with a sufficiently large number of terms to ensure numerical accuracy for $T_v$ in the range of the supplied data.\n2.

Enforce the physical constraints $c_v > 0$ and $m_v > 0$ through appropriate optimization bounds. Use equal weights for all measurements.\n3. Implement a program that, for each test case below, estimates $c_v$ and $m_v$ in SI units. Output each estimated value as a float rounded to six significant digits. The final single-line output must be a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as $[c_{v,1}, m_{v,1}, c_{v,2}, m_{v,2}, c_{v,3}, m_{v,3}]$.\n\nData are provided in SI units unless explicitly stated otherwise.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and constraints to define a standard parameter estimation problem. The language is objective and precise. The data values are physically realistic for the described scenarios. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Derivation of the Average Degree of Consolidation $U(T_v)$**\n\nThe problem is governed by the diffusion equation $\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c_v \\dfrac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$. We solve this partial differential equation on the domain $z \\in [0, H_d]$ subject to the initial condition $u(z,0) = \\Delta \\sigma'$. The boundary conditions for both single drainage and, by symmetry, double drainage can be represented as a drained boundary at $z=0$ and an impermeable (no-flow) boundary at $z=H_d$.\n1.  Drained boundary: $u(0, t) = 0$.\n2.  Impermeable boundary: $\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}(H_d, t) = 0$.\n\nApplying the method of separation of variables, where $u(z,t) = Z(z)T(t)$, yields the general solution form as a Fourier series. The spatial eigenfunctions $Z(z)$ satisfying the boundary conditions are $\\sin(\\lambda_m z)$, where the eigenvalues $\\lambda_m$ are given by $\\lambda_m H_d = \\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nThe complete solution for the excess pore pressure $u(z,t)$ is found by applying the initial condition $u(z,0)=\\Delta\\sigma'$ to determine the series coefficients:\n$$\nu(z,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4\\Delta\\sigma'}{(2m-1)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi z}{2H_d}\\right) \\exp\\left( -c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2H_d}\\right)^2 t \\right)\n$$\nLet us define the dimensionless constant $M_m = \\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}$ and the time factor $T_v = \\frac{c_v t}{H_d^2}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nu(z,t) = \\Delta\\sigma' \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{M_m} \\sin\\left(\\frac{M_m z}{H_d}\\right) \\exp\\left( -M_m^2 T_v \\right)\n$$\nThe average degree of consolidation, $U(t)$, is the ratio of settlement at time $t$ to the final settlement. This equals the ratio of dissipated pore pressure (averaged over the layer) to the initial pore pressure:\n$$\nU(t) = \\frac{s(t)}{S_f} = 1 - \\frac{\\int_0^{H} u(z,t') \\mathrm{d}z'}{\\int_0^{H} u(z,0) \\mathrm{d}z'} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Area of } u \\text{ diagram at time } t}{\\text{Area of } u \\text{ diagram at time } 0}\n$$\nIt can be shown that this definition leads to an identical expression for $U$ as a function of $T_v$ for both single and double drainage cases, provided the correct drainage path $H_d$ is used. By integrating the expression for $u(z,t)$ over the drainage path $[0, H_d]$ and normalizing, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_0^{H_d} u(z,t) \\mathrm{d}z = \\Delta\\sigma' H_d \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{M_m^2} \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v)\n$$\nThe initial area is $\\int_0^{H_d} \\Delta \\sigma' \\mathrm{d}z = \\Delta\\sigma' H_d$. The degree of consolidation for the half-layer (in the double drainage case) or full layer (in the single drainage case) is:\n$$\nU(T_v) = 1 - \\frac{\\int_0^{H_d} u(z,t) \\mathrm{d}z}{\\Delta\\sigma' H_d} = 1 - \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{M_m^2} \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v)\n$$\nSubstituting $M_m = \\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}$, we arrive at the required computable expression:\n$$\nU(T_v) = 1 - \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{((2m-1)\\pi)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{((2m-1)\\pi)^2}{4} T_v \\right)\n$$\nThis series will be truncated at $N=100$ terms for numerical implementation, as specified.\n\n**Parameter Estimation**\n\nThe parameters $c_v$ and $m_v$ are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the measured settlements $s_i$ and the settlements predicted by the model, $s_{model}(t_i)$. This defines a non-linear least-squares problem.\n\nThe objective is to find the parameter vector $\\mathbf{p} = [c_v, m_v]$ that minimizes the objective function $S(\\mathbf{p})$:\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{p}} S(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left[ s_i - s_{model}(t_i; c_v, m_v) \\right]^2\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of data points, and the model is:\n$$\ns_{model}(t_i; c_v, m_v) = m_v \\, \\Delta \\sigma' \\, H \\, U\\left(\\frac{c_v t_i}{H_d^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis minimization must be performed subject to the bounds $c_v \\in (10^{-12}, 10^{-5})$ and $m_v \\in (10^{-12}, 10^{-3})$.\n\n**Numerical Implementation**\n\nA Python script will be constructed to solve this problem for each test case.\n1.  A function implementing the truncated series for $U(T_v)$ is created. It is vectorized using `numpy` for efficiency.\n2.  A residual function, which computes $s_i - s_{model}(t_i; c_v, m_v)$, is defined for the optimizer.\n3.  For each test case, initial guesses for $c_v$ and $m_v$ are estimated from the data to ensure robust convergence. $m_v$ is estimated from the final settlement point, and $c_v$ is estimated using the time to achieve $50\\%$ consolidation ($t_{50}$), at which $T_v \\approx 0.197$.\n4.  The `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function is employed to find the optimal $c_v$ and $m_v$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals, respecting the provided bounds.\n5.

This exercise delves into the important phenomenon of secondary compression, or creep, which causes settlement to continue long after excess pore pressures have dissipated. You will explore how to model this effect and, critically, how to separate it from primary consolidation in experimental data, a necessary step for avoiding biased parameter estimation and making accurate long-term predictions [@problem_id:2872152].", "problem": "A laterally confined, fully saturated clay layer of thickness $H$ is subjected at time $t=0$ to a uniform step increase in total vertical stress $\\Delta \\sigma$. Assume small strains, incompressible solid grains and pore fluid, and validity of Darcyâ€™s law. Under these assumptions, the one-dimensional (along $z$) dissipation of excess pore pressure $u(z,t)$ in the clay is governed by a linear diffusion equation derived from equilibrium of total stress, effective stress, mass conservation of fluid, and Darcyâ€™s law. The time-dependent primary consolidation settlement results from dissipation of $u(z,t)$ and the associated increase in effective stress $\\sigma^{\\prime}(z,t)$, while the soil skeleton also exhibits a time-dependent volumetric creep at approximately constant effective stress that is empirically observed to be nearly linear with $\\log t$ after a short transient. \n\nSuppose one chooses to model the total settlement $s(t)$ at the top surface as the superposition of a primary consolidation component $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ determined by the pore-pressure diffusion problem and a secondary compression (creep) component $s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$ that is linear in $\\log t$ with coefficient $C_{\\alpha}$, i.e., $s(t)=s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)+C_{\\alpha}\\log\\!\\big(t/t_{0}\\big)$ for $t>0$, where $t_{0}$ is a reference time introduced for dimensional consistency. In an incremental oedometer loading step, you record $s(t)$ over several decades of $t$ and observe a persistent nonzero slope on a plot of $s$ versus $\\log t$ at late times.\n\nWhich of the following statements most correctly describes both the influence of including the linear creep term on the apparent primary consolidation parameters and a consistent strategy, grounded in the governing principles stated above, to separate the primary and secondary components in the $s(t)$ record?\n\nA. Because the governing diffusion equation and the linearized constitutive law are both linear, settlement contributions add. A consistent separation is to estimate $C_{\\alpha}$ from the late-time constant slope of $s$ versus $\\log t$ when excess pore pressure $u$ has essentially dissipated, subtract $C_{\\alpha}\\log\\!\\big(t/t_{0}\\big)$ from the entire $s(t)$ record to obtain an approximation of $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$, and then identify primary parameters (such as the coefficient of consolidation $c_{v}$) by fitting the diffusion-governed response. If the creep term is ignored and the raw $s(t)$ is fit by a primary-only model, the extra late-time settlement is incorrectly attributed to slow pore-pressure dissipation, biasing the estimated $c_{v}$ downward.\n\nB. Secondary compression is inactive until primary consolidation is complete. Therefore, one should determine the end of primary time $t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$ from a theoretical average degree of consolidation and subtract a $\\log t$ creep term only for $t>t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, leaving the earlier portion unchanged. Neglecting creep when fitting a primary-only model to the full $s(t)$ instead biases the estimated $c_{v}$ upward because the added settlement accelerates the curve toward completion.\n\nC. The correct way to separate creep is to use the early-time linearity of primary consolidation in a plot of $s$ versus $\\sqrt{t}$ to determine the creep slope; because the creep term is linear in $\\log t$, it will appear as a linear trend in $\\sqrt{t}$ at early times. After removing this trend from the entire record, the remaining curve yields unbiased estimates of $c_{v}$. Ignoring creep mainly affects the estimated compressibility but leaves $c_{v}$ essentially unbiased.\n\nD. Superposition of $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ and $s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$ is not valid because Darcyâ€™s law is nonlinear in the hydraulic gradient at laboratory gradients, so the creep term must be treated as a multiplicative factor on the primary settlement, $s(t)=s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)\\big[1+C_{\\alpha}\\log\\!\\big(t/t_{0}\\big)\\big]$.

This is empirically observed to be nearly linear with $\\log t$.\n- **Proposed Model:** The total settlement $s(t)$ is modeled as a superposition of primary and secondary components: $s(t) = s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t) + s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$.\n- **Creep Component Definition:** The secondary compression (creep) component is given by $s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t) = C_{\\alpha}\\log(t/t_{0})$ for $t>0$, where $C_{\\alpha}$ is a coefficient and $t_0$ is a reference time.\n- **Observation:** An experimental record of $s(t)$ versus time shows a persistent nonzero slope on a plot of $s$ versus $\\log t$ at late times.\n- **Question:** Identify the statement that correctly describes both the influence of the creep term on apparent primary consolidation parameters and a consistent strategy to separate the primary and secondary components.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on the classical theory of one-dimensional consolidation by Terzaghi, augmented with a standard empirical model for secondary compression (creep). The superposition of primary consolidation and secondary creep is a widely accepted engineering approach, known as Hypothesis A in geotechnical literature. All principles invokedâ€”diffusion, Darcy's law, effective stress, superpositionâ€”are standard in soil mechanics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The question asks for the logical consequences of the stated physical model and for a consistent data analysis procedure based on it. It is a conceptual problem with a definite, derivable answer based on the provided framework.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective technical terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of ambiguity or contradiction. It provides a valid basis for a rigorous scientific analysis. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe foundation of this problem rests on the superposition model provided:\n$$s(t) = s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t) + s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$$\nwhere $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ is the primary consolidation settlement and $s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$ is the secondary compression settlement.\n\nThe primary consolidation settlement $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ is governed by the one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c_{v} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$$\nwhere $c_{v}$ is the coefficient of consolidation. The solution for $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ shows that it asymptotically approaches a final value, $s_{\\mathrm{p,final}}$, as $t \\to \\infty$. This occurs as the excess pore pressure $u(z,t)$ dissipates completely, i.e., $u(z,t) \\to 0$. Therefore, for sufficiently large time, $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ becomes constant:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t) = s_{\\mathrm{p,final}}$$\nThe secondary compression is given as:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t) = C_{\\alpha}\\log\\left(\\frac{t}{t_{0}}\\right)$$\nCombining these, the total settlement at late times is:\n$$s(t) \\approx s_{\\mathrm{p,final}} + C_{\\alpha}\\log\\left(\\frac{t}{t_{0}}\\right) \\quad \\text{for large } t$$\nTo analyze the experimental observation of a plot of $s$ versus $\\log t$, we examine the slope of this function. Let $x = \\log t$. Then $t = 10^x$.\n$$s(x) \\approx s_{\\mathrm{p,final}} + C_{\\alpha}(x - \\log(t_0))$$\nThe slope of $s$ with respect to $\\log t$ is:\n$$\\frac{ds}{d(\\log t)} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ s_{\\mathrm{p,final}} + C_{\\alpha}x - C_{\\alpha}\\log(t_0) \\right] = C_{\\alpha}$$\nThis demonstrates that the \"persistent nonzero slope on a plot of $s$ versus $\\log t$ at late times\" is precisely the secondary compression index, $C_{\\alpha}$. This provides a direct method for determining $C_{\\alpha}$ from oedometer test data.\n\nA consistent strategy for separating the components, based on this model, is as follows:\n1. Plot the measured total settlement $s(t)$ against $\\log t$.\n2. Identify the linear portion of the curve at late times (after primary consolidation is substantially complete). The slope of this line is the coefficient $C_{\\alpha}$.\n3. Calculate the secondary settlement component for all time points using the determined $C_{\\alpha}$: $s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t) = C_{\\alpha}\\log(t/t_0)$. The reference time $t_0$ can be found from the intercept of the line, but is secondary to removing the logarithmic trend.\n4. Subtract this calculated secondary settlement from the total measured settlement to isolate the primary consolidation component: $s_{\\mathrm{p,corrected}}(t) = s(t) - s_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$.\n5. This corrected curve, $s_{\\mathrm{p,corrected}}(t)$, should now conform to the theoretical behavior of primary consolidation, i.e., it should approach a horizontal asymptote. Standard methods (e.g., Casagrande's logarithm-of-time fitting or Taylor's square-root-of-time fitting) can be applied to this corrected curve to determine primary parameters such as the coefficient of consolidation $c_{v}$.\n\nNow consider the consequence of ignoring the creep term. If one attempts to fit the raw total settlement data $s(t) = s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t) + s_{\\mathrms}(t)$ with a primary-only model, the fitting procedure must account for the continuous settlement at late times caused by the $s_{\\mathrms}(t)$ term. A primary-only model can only continue to produce settlement as long as pore pressure is dissipating. To match the prolonged settlement observed in the data, the theoretical model must be modified to make the pore pressure dissipate more slowly. The rate of dissipation is governed by $c_{v}$. A slower dissipation rate implies a smaller value of $c_{v}$. Thus, ignoring creep misattributes a rheological soil skeleton effect to a hydraulic delay, resulting in a systematic underestimation (downward bias) of $c_{v}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This statement posits that settlement contributions add due to linearity, a separation is possible by estimating $C_{\\alpha}$ from the late-time slope of $s$ vs $\\log t$, subtracting the creep component from the entire record to get $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$, and then fitting for $c_v$. It also states that ignoring creep biases $c_v$ downward. This aligns perfectly with the derivation above. The justification for superposition is reasonable, the procedure for separating components is correct, and the conclusion about the bias in $c_v$ is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This statement claims secondary compression is inactive until primary consolidation is complete. This describes a different model (often called Hypothesis B), which contradicts the superposition model $s(t)=s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)+s_{\\mathrms}(t)$ for all $t>0$ given in the problem. The problem asks for reasoning within the given framework, not to switch to an alternative one. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims that neglecting creep biases $c_v$ upward. As derived, the additional settlement makes the process appear slower, hence biasing $c_v$ downward.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This statement suggests determining the creep slope from an early-time plot of $s$ versus $\\sqrt{t}$. At early times, $s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ is approximately linear in $\\sqrt{t}$. However, the creep term $s_{\\mathrms}(t) = C_{\\alpha}\\log(t/t_0)$ is highly non-linear with respect to $\\sqrt{t}$ for small $t$; in fact, $\\lim_{t\\to 0}\\log(t)=-\\infty$. The premise that the creep term appears linear on a $\\sqrt{t}$ plot is mathematically false. The proposed separation method is therefore invalid. The claim that ignoring creep leaves $c_v$ \"essentially unbiased\" is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This statement challenges the validity of the superposition model and Darcy's law, both of which are given premises in the problem statement. One must reason within the constraints of the problem, not argue against them. Proposing a multiplicative model, $s(t)=s_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)\\big[1+C_{\\alpha}\\log\\!\\big(t/t_{0}\\big)\\big]$, is irrelevant as the question is about the consequences of the given *additive* model. This option fails to address the question as posed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement A provides a description that is mathematically, physically, and logically consistent with the premises of the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2872152"}, {"introduction": "To solve the consolidation equation for complex geometries and boundary conditions, engineers often turn to numerical methods like the finite difference method.

It presents a standard task in the numerical analysis of partial differential Equations, specifically the stability analysis of the Forward-Time Centered-Space (FTCS) discretization of the one-dimensional diffusion equation, which governs Terzaghi consolidation. All necessary information is provided. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the stability condition for the given finite difference scheme using the von Neumann stability analysis method. The scheme is given by:\n$$\nu_{j}^{n+1} = u_{j}^{n} + r \\left( u_{j+1}^{n} - 2u_{j}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $u_{j}^{n}$ is the numerical approximation of the excess pore pressure $u(z, t)$ at grid point $z_j = j \\Delta z$ and time level $t^n = n \\Delta t$.

We analyze the behavior of a single, generic Fourier mode over one time step. Let the solution at grid point $j$ and time $n$ for a mode with wavenumber $k$ be of the form:\n$$\nu_{j}^{n} = A(k)^{n} e^{i k z_{j}} = A(k)^{n} e^{i k j \\Delta z}\n$$\nHere, $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit, and $A(k)$ is the amplification factor for the mode with wavenumber $k$. For the numerical scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any possible wavenumber $k$. This condition prevents any Fourier mode from growing unboundedly in time. The stability condition is therefore:\n$$\n|A(k)| \\le 1 \\quad \\forall k\n$$\nTo find the expression for $A(k)$, we substitute the modal solution form into the finite difference equation:\n$$\nA(k)^{n+1} e^{i k j \\Delta z} = A(k)^{n} e^{i k j \\Delta z} + r \\left( A(k)^{n} e^{i k (j+1) \\Delta z} - 2 A(k)^{n} e^{i k j \\Delta z} + A(k)^{n} e^{i k (j-1) \\Delta z} \\right)\n$$\nWe have $A(k)^{n+1} = A(k) \\cdot A(k)^n$.
