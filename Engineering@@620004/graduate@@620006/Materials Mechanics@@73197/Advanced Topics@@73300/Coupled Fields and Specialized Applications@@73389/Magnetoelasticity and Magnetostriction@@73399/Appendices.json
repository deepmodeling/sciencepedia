To solve this, we will employ the principles of continuum mechanics, specifically the theory of linear elasticity incorporating an eigenstrain.\n\nThe fundamental constitutive relation connecting stress, strain, and eigenstrain is the generalized Hooke's law.

The problem statement explicitly confirms the lateral stress components are zero, $\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_{yy}=0$. The traction-free end condition implies the axial stress component is also zero, $\\sigma_{zz}=0$. Therefore, the stress tensor is identically zero throughout the material:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = 0 $$\nConsequently, the trace of the stress tensor is also zero, $\\sigma_{kk} = 0$.

We denote the longitudinal strain as $\\epsilon_{\\parallel} = \\epsilon_{zz}$ and the transverse strain as $\\epsilon_{\\perp} = \\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy}$.\nThe equations become:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{E}\\left[0 - \\nu(0 + \\sigma_{zz})\\right] - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{zz} - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\parallel} = \\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(0 + 0)\\right] + \\lambda_s = \\frac{1}{E}\\sigma_{zz} + \\lambda_s \\quad (2)\n$$\nWe now analyze the two specified boundary-condition classes using these governing equations.\n\n**Case 1: Stress-controlled ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$)**\nThis case represents a specimen that is free to deform axially. We substitute the condition $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ into equations $(1)$ and $(2)$.\n\nFor the longitudinal strain $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\parallel} = \\frac{1}{E}(0) + \\lambda_s = \\lambda_s\n$$\nFor the transverse strain $\\epsilon_{\\perp}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\perp} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(0) - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} = -\\frac{\\lambda_s}{2}\n$$\nThus, for the stress-controlled condition, the measured strains are $\\epsilon_{\\parallel} = \\lambda_s$ and $\\epsilon_{\\perp} = -\\frac{\\lambda_s}{2}$.\n\n**Case 2: Strain-controlled ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$)**\nThis case represents an axially clamped specimen, where the total axial strain is constrained to be zero. This constraint will induce an internal reaction stress $\\sigma_{zz}$.\n\nFrom the condition $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\epsilon_{\\parallel} = 0$ and equation $(2)$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E}\\sigma_{zz} + \\lambda_s\n$$\nSolving for the reaction stress $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E}\\sigma_{zz} = -\\lambda_s \\implies \\sigma_{zz} = -E\\,\\lambda_s\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a compressive stress is generated to counteract the magnetostrictive expansion (assuming $\\lambda_s > 0$).\nNow, we find the transverse strain $\\epsilon_{\\perp}$ by substituting this reaction stress into equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\perp} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{zz} - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(-E\\,\\lambda_s) - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\perp} = \\nu\\lambda_s - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2}\n$$\nThus, for the strain-controlled condition, the longitudinal strain is zero by definition, the transverse strain is $\\epsilon_{\\perp} = \\nu\\lambda_s - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2}$, and the internal axial stress is $\\sigma_{zz} = -E\\,\\lambda_s$.\n\nWe now evaluate each of the given options based on these derived results.\n\n**A. Stress-controlled ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=\\lambda_s$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=-\\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$. Strain-controlled ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=0$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=\\nu \\lambda_s - \\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$, with reaction stress $\\sigma_{zz}=-E\\,\\lambda_s$.**\nThis option presents results that are in exact agreement with our derivations for both the stress-controlled and strain-controlled cases. All quantities—longitudinal strain, transverse strain, and reaction stress—are correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Stress-controlled ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=\\dfrac{3}{2}\\lambda_s$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=-\\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$. Strain-controlled ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=0$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=-\\nu \\lambda_s - \\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$, with reaction stress $\\sigma_{zz}=+E\\,\\lambda_s$.**\nThe longitudinal strain in the stress-controlled case is given as $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=\\dfrac{3}{2}\\lambda_s$, which is incorrect; our derivation shows $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=\\lambda_s$. Furthermore, the reaction stress in the strain-controlled case is given as $\\sigma_{zz}=+E\\,\\lambda_s$, which has the incorrect sign.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Stress-controlled ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=\\lambda_s$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=+\\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$. Strain-controlled ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=0$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=-\\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$, with no reaction stress.**\nThe transverse strain in the stress-controlled case is given as $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=+\\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$, which has the incorrect sign. A material that expands along one axis (for $\\lambda_s>0$) must contract transversally to maintain zero volume change, consistent with the eigenstrain tensor. The claim of \"no reaction stress\" in the clamped case is also fundamentally incorrect; constraining a material that has a natural tendency to change length (due to $\\epsilon^{\\mathrm{m}}_{zz} \\ne 0$) must induce a stress.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Stress-controlled ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=\\lambda_s$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=-\\dfrac{\\lambda_s}{2}$. Strain-controlled ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$): $\\epsilon_{\\parallel}=0$, $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=0$, with reaction stress $\\sigma_{zz}=0$.**\nThe stress-controlled part is correct. However, for the strain-controlled case, it claims $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, which would only be true if $\\lambda_s=0$. It also claims $\\epsilon_{\\perp}=0$, which would require $\\nu\\lambda_s - \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} = 0$, or $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is not generally true for all elastic solids. The assertion $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ contradicts the premise of a clamped condition with non-zero magnetostriction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only option A is fully consistent with the principles of continuum mechanics as applied to the given problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2899525"}]}
