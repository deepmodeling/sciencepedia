A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the Hertzian contact relations begins with two primary conditions: the force equilibrium and the geometric compatibility of the surfaces.\n\n$1$. Force Equilibrium: The total applied normal force $P$ must equal the integral of the contact pressure distribution $p(r)$ over the circular contact area of radius $a$. For an axisymmetric problem, this is:\n$$ P = \\int_{0}^{a} p(r) \\, 2\\pi r \\, \\mathrm{d}r $$\nThe pressure distribution that satisfies the governing equations of elasticity for this geometry is the Hertzian pressure distribution:\n$$ p(r) = p_{0} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}} $$\nwhere $p_{0}$ is the maximum pressure at the center of contact ($r=0$). Substituting this into the force integral yields:\n$$ P = 2\\pi p_{0} \\int_{0}^{a} r \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}} \\, \\mathrm{d}r $$\nLet $u = 1 - (r/a)^{2}$, then $\\mathrm{d}u = -2r/a^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}r$.

Geometric Compatibility: Inside the contact area ($r \\le a$), the deformed surface of the half-space must conform to the shape of the spherical indenter. The initial separation between the undeformed surfaces is given by $z(r) = r^{2}/(2R)$. Let $u_{z}(r)$ be the normal displacement of the half-space surface. The compatibility condition is that the sum of the surface displacement and the initial surface profile equals the total indentation approach $\\delta$:\n$$ u_{z}(r) + \\frac{r^{2}}{2R} = \\delta \\quad \\text{for} \\quad r \\le a $$\nThe normal surface displacement $u_{z}(r)$ resulting from the Hertzian pressure distribution $p(r)$ is given by elasticity theory as:\n$$ u_{z}(r) = \\frac{\\pi p_{0}}{4aE^{*}} (2a^{2} - r^{2}) $$\nSubstituting this expression for $u_{z}(r)$ into the compatibility equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi p_{0}}{4aE^{*}} (2a^{2} - r^{2}) + \\frac{r^{2}}{2R} = \\delta $$\n$$ \\frac{\\pi p_{0}a}{2E^{*}} - \\frac{\\pi p_{0}}{4aE^{*}}r^{2} + \\frac{1}{2R}r^{2} = \\delta $$\nThis equation must hold for all $r \\in [0, a]$.

Within the context of Hertzian contact, the ratio $p_{0}/E^{*}$ serves as a proxy for the magnitude of characteristic compressive strain in the material beneath the indenter. The calculated value of approximately $0.0125$, or $1.25\\%$, is small but not infinitesimal. For many engineering materials, particularly metals, this strain level is at the upper limit of the linear elastic regime and may approach or exceed the material's elastic limit (yield strain). If yielding occurs, plastic deformation would initiate, and the assumptions of the Hertzian model are formally violated. Therefore, while the linear elastic solution provides a valuable first-order approximation, the validity of the small-strain assumption is marginal. A more complete analysis for a specific material would require comparison of the stress state (e.g., the maximum shear stress, which is approximately $0.31p_{0}$ below the surface) with the material's yield criterion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1957 & 1.246 & 3.832 & 0.01246\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2873334"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the normal contact problem, we now introduce friction, a critical factor in most real-world interfaces.

It is a rigorous test of understanding the application of superposition and scaling arguments in elasticity.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution is derived from first principles as dictated. The core physical insight, first articulated by Cattaneo, is to use the principle of linear superposition. The final state of shear traction, $q(r)$, resulting from the application of a normal load $P$ followed by a tangential load $Q$, can be constructed by superposing two elastic solutions.\n\nLet the final shear traction distribution be $q(r)$. We model this as the superposition of a \"full slip\" traction field and a \"corrective\" traction field:\n$q(r) = q_{1}(r) - q_{2}(r)$.\n\n1.  The first field, $q_{1}(r)$, is the shear traction that would exist if the entire contact area of radius $a$ were slipping. According to the Coulomb friction law, this traction is everywhere proportional to the normal pressure $p(r)$:\n    $$q_{1}(r) = \\mu p(r) = \\mu p_{0} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le r \\le a$$\n    The total tangential force associated with this field, $Q_{1}$, is found by integration:\n    $$Q_{1} = \\int_{0}^{a} q_{1}(r) (2\\pi r) \\mathrm{d}r = \\mu \\int_{0}^{a} p_{0} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}} (2\\pi r) \\mathrm{d}r$$\n    This integral is structurally identical to the integral for the total normal force $P = \\int_{0}^{a} p(r) (2\\pi r) \\mathrm{d}r$. Given the relation $p_{0} = \\frac{3P}{2\\pi a^{2}}$, we know that $\\int_{0}^{a} p_{0} \\sqrt{1 - (r/a)^{2}} (2\\pi r) \\mathrm{d}r = P$. Therefore, the total tangential force for the full slip condition is simply:\n    $$Q_{1} = \\mu P$$\n\n2.  The second field, $q_{2}(r)$, is a corrective field applied in the opposite direction over the central stick region of radius $c$. This field must be structured such that it cancels the relative slip within this region. For tangential loading of an elastic half-space, a uniform tangential displacement within a circular region of radius $c$ is produced by a shear traction distribution of Hertzian form over that same region. Thus, we model $q_{2}(r)$ as:\n    $$q_{2}(r) = q'_{0} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{c}\\right)^{2}} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le r \\le c$$\n    and $q_{2}(r) = 0$ for $r > c$.\n\nThe superposition of these two fields creates a state where, for $r \\le c$, the relative tangential displacement is uniform (i.e., stick), and for $c < r \\le a$, only the $q_{1}(r)$ field exists, corresponding to slip. The final traction distribution is therefore:\nFor the slip annulus ($c < r \\le a$):\n$$q(r) = q_{1}(r) = \\mu p(r)$$\nFor the stick zone ($0 \\le r \\le c$):\n$$q(r) = q_{1}(r) - q_{2}(r) = \\mu p(r) - q'_{0} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{c}\\right)^{2}}$$\n\nThe key step is to determine the peak corrective traction $q'_{0}$. The physics of the load history (monotonic increase of $Q$) implies a self-similarity. The process of establishing a stick zone of radius $c$ is physically equivalent to a reversed application of tangential load over that region. This leads to the crucial insight that the corrective shear traction field, $q_2(r)$, must be proportional to the normal pressure field, $p(r, c)$, that would produce a contact of radius $c$. The proportionality constant is $\\mu$ to ensure continuity of traction at $r=c$. Thus, $q_{2}(r) = \\mu p(r, c)$.\n\nThe total tangential force $Q$ is the integral of the final traction distribution $q(r)$ over the entire contact area:\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{a} q(r) (2\\pi r) \\mathrm{d}r = \\int_{0}^{a} q_{1}(r) (2\\pi r) \\mathrm{d}r - \\int_{0}^{c} q_{2}(r) (2\\pi r) \\mathrm{d}r$$\nThe first integral is $Q_{1} = \\mu P$. The second integral is the total force associated with the corrective field $q_{2}(r) = \\mu p(r, c)$, which we denote as $\\mu P_{c}$. Here, $P_{c}$ is the hypothetical normal load that would be required to produce a Hertzian contact of radius $c$.\n$$Q = \\mu P - \\mu P_{c}$$\n\nNow, we use the provided scaling law: the normal load for a Hertz contact of radius $\\alpha$ scales as $P \\propto \\alpha^{3}$. This means there exists a constant $K$ (determined by material properties and indenter geometry) such that $P = K a^{3}$ and $P_{c} = K c^{3}$. From this, we establish a direct relationship between $P$ and $P_{c}$:\n$$\\frac{P_{c}}{P} = \\frac{K c^{3}}{K a^{3}} = \\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^{3} \\implies P_{c} = P \\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^{3}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $Q$:\n$$Q = \\mu P - \\mu P \\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^{3} = \\mu P \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^{3}\\right)$$\n\n**1) Central Stick Radius, $c$**\nWe can now solve for the stick radius $c$ as a function of the normalized tangential force $Q/(\\mu P)$ and the contact radius $a$:\n$$\\frac{Q}{\\mu P} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^{3}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^{3} = 1 - \\frac{Q}{\\mu P}$$\n$$c = a \\left(1 - \\frac{Q}{\\mu P}\\right)^{1/3}$$\nThis is the required expression for the central stick radius.\n\n**2) Shear Traction in Slip Annulus, $q_{\\text{slip}}(r)$**\nIn the slip annulus, defined by $c < r \\le a$, the shear traction is at its limit as dictated by the Coulomb friction law. Its magnitude is $|q(r)| = \\mu p(r)$, and its direction is aligned with the applied tangential force $Q$.\n$$q_{\\text{slip}}(r) = \\mu p(r)$$\nUsing the provided expression for the Hertz pressure distribution, $p(r) = p_{0} \\sqrt{1 - (r/a)^{2}}$ with $p_{0} = \\frac{3P}{2\\pi a^{2}}$, we find the shear traction in the slip annulus to be:\n$$q_{\\text{slip}}(r) = \\mu \\frac{3P}{2\\pi a^{2}} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}} \\quad \\text{for } c < r \\le a$$\nThis is the final expression for the shear traction in the slip region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} a \\left(1 - \\frac{Q}{\\mu P}\\right)^{1/3} & \\mu \\frac{3P}{2\\pi a^{2}} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2873309"}, {"introduction": "To bridge the gap between analytical theory and modern computational practice, this final exercise focuses on the numerical implementation of friction models.

The power conjugate pair at the interface is the tangential traction and the rate of tangential slip, and the second law of thermodynamics requires nonnegative dissipation.\n\nTasks:\n- Starting only from the following foundational elements, derive a consistent discrete return-mapping algorithm for the tangential traction update and the plastic slip increment:\n  - The admissible set of tangential tractions is the closed disc $\\mathcal{F}(t_n,\\mu) = \\{\\mathbf{t}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\|\\mathbf{t}_t\\| \\le \\mu\\, t_n\\}$, with the friction coefficient $\\mu \\in [0,1]$ and compressive normal traction $t_n \\ge 0$.\n  - The elastic tangential traction is proportional to the elastic tangential slip through the penalty stiffness $k_t > 0$.\n  - The Kuhn–Tucker complementarity conditions for unilateral constraints and the principle of maximum dissipation consistent with dry friction.\n  - The discrete dissipation per unit area over one time step is the work of the tangential traction on the plastic slip increment, $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t$, where $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1} - \\mathbf{p}_t^n$.\n- Prove that your discrete update is dissipative, in the sense that the discrete dissipation inequality $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} \\ge 0$ holds for both sticking and slipping outcomes, including the stick-slip boundary case.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Implement the derived return-mapping algorithm as a function that, for given parameters $(\\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1}, \\mathbf{p}_t^n, k_t, t_n, \\mu)$, returns the updated tangential traction vector $\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the updated plastic slip $\\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the plastic slip increment magnitude $\\Delta \\gamma = \\|\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t\\| \\ge 0$, and the discrete dissipation per unit area $\\Delta \\mathcal{D}$.\n- Use the sign convention that compression is positive, so that $t_n \\ge 0$.\n- Units:\n  - $k_t$ must be given in $\\mathrm{Pa/m}$,\n  - $\\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1}$ and $\\mathbf{p}_t^n$ in $\\mathrm{m}$,\n  - $t_n$ and $\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$,\n  - $\\Delta \\mathcal{D}$ in $\\mathrm{J/m^2}$.\n- Your program must also evaluate a boolean flag that states whether the discrete dissipation inequality is satisfied within a nonnegative tolerance (you may choose a small nonnegative tolerance to account for floating point rounding).\n\nTest suite:\nFor each of the following test cases, compute the four-tuple $[\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|, \\Delta \\gamma, \\Delta \\mathcal{D}, \\text{ok}]$, where `ok` is a boolean that is true if $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} \\ge -\\varepsilon$ for a small chosen tolerance $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$ and false otherwise.

The formulation is based on the principles of generalized standard materials, which we will use to derive the required return-mapping algorithm. The validity of the problem is confirmed, as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary data are provided. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe local contact problem is defined at a single material point on a contact interface. The state is described by the tangential traction vector $\\mathbf{t}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and the plastic slip vector $\\mathbf{p}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The evolution of these variables is governed by a set of constitutive equations, which we will discretize in time using a backward Euler scheme. Let the time step be from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$. We are given the state at $t_n$ (represented by $\\mathbf{p}_t^n$) and the total tangential displacement $\\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1}$ at $t_{n+1}$. The objective is to compute the updated state $(\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}, \\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1})$.\n\nThe constitutive framework is composed of three main building blocks:\n1.  An elastic law relating traction to elastic slip.\n2.  A constraint on admissible tractions, defined by a yield function.\n3.  A flow rule for the plastic slip, coupled with loading/unloading conditions.\n\nFirst, we define the elastic and plastic decomposition of the total tangential displacement. The total displacement $\\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1}$ is the sum of the current elastic slip $\\mathbf{e}_t^{n+1}$ and the current plastic slip $\\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1} = \\mathbf{e}_t^{n+1} + \\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1} $$\nThe elastic law, regularized by a penalty stiffness $k_t > 0$, states that the tangential traction is proportional to the elastic slip:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} = k_t \\mathbf{e}_t^{n+1} = k_t (\\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1} - \\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1}) $$\nThe set of admissible tractions is the friction disk $\\mathcal{F}$, a convex set defined by the yield function $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}(t_n, \\mu) = \\{ \\mathbf{t}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\Phi(\\mathbf{t}_t) \\le 0 \\}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\Phi(\\mathbf{t}_t) = \\|\\mathbf{t}_t\\| - \\mu t_n $$\nHere, $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is the Euclidean norm, $\\mu \\ge 0$ is the coefficient of friction, and $t_n \\ge 0$ is the given compressive normal traction.\n\nThe evolution of plastic slip is governed by an associative flow rule, consistent with the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The plastic slip increment, $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1} - \\mathbf{p}_t^n$, is directed along the outward normal to the yield surface:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}} = \\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|} $$\nwhere $\\Delta \\gamma \\ge 0$ is the consistency parameter, or the magnitude of the plastic slip increment $\\|\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t\\|$. The evolution is constrained by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions:\n$$ \\Phi(\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}) \\le 0, \\quad \\Delta \\gamma \\ge 0, \\quad \\Delta \\gamma \\cdot \\Phi(\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}) = 0 $$\nThese conditions enforce that plastic slip can only occur when the traction state lies on the boundary of the admissible set ($\\Phi = 0$).\n\nTo solve this system of nonlinear equations, we employ an elastic predictor-plastic corrector scheme, also known as a return-mapping algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Elastic Predictor (Trial State)\nWe first assume the step is purely elastic, meaning no plastic slip occurs, i.e., $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{0}$. The trial state is computed under this assumption.\nThe trial plastic slip is $\\mathbf{p}_t^{\\text{trial}} = \\mathbf{p}_t^n$.\nThe trial elastic slip is $\\mathbf{e}_t^{\\text{trial}} = \\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1} - \\mathbf{p}_t^n$.\nThe trial tangential traction is therefore:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}} = k_t \\mathbf{e}_t^{\\text{trial}} = k_t (\\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1} - \\mathbf{p}_t^n) $$\n\nStep 2: Admissibility Check and Plastic Corrector (Return Mapping)\nWe check if the trial traction is admissible by evaluating the yield function:\n$$ \\Phi^{\\text{trial}} = \\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| - \\mu t_n $$\nThere are two possible outcomes:\n\nCase I: Stick Condition ($\\Phi^{\\text{trial}} \\le 0$)\nIf the trial traction is inside or on the boundary of the friction disk, the elastic assumption is valid. The KKT conditions are satisfied with $\\Delta \\gamma = 0$.\nThe final state is the trial state:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1} = \\mathbf{p}_t^n $$\nThe plastic slip increment magnitude is $\\Delta \\gamma = \\|\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t\\| = 0$.\n\nCase II: Slip Condition ($\\Phi^{\\text{trial}} > 0$)\nIf the trial traction is outside the friction disk, the elastic assumption is invalid. Plastic slip must occur ($\\Delta \\gamma > 0$), and the final traction state must lie on the yield surface ($\\Phi(\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}) = 0$).\nWe combine the elastic law and the flow rule. The elastic law can be rewritten using the trial traction:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} = k_t (\\mathbf{u}_t^{n+1} - \\mathbf{p}_t^n - \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t) = \\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}} - k_t \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t $$\nSubstituting the flow rule $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}} - k_t \\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|} $$\nThis equation reveals that $\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}$ must be collinear with $\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}$. This is a radial return, a direct consequence of the yield surface being a circle centered at the origin. Thus, the direction of the final traction is the same as the trial traction:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} $$\nSince $\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}$ is on the boundary, its magnitude is $\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\| = \\mu t_n$. Combining these gives the updated traction:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} = (\\mu t_n) \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} $$\nThis operation is geometrically a projection of the point $\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}$ onto the convex set $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nThe plastic slip increment $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t$ is found by rearranging the elastic law:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\frac{1}{k_t} (\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}} - \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{k_t} \\left(\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}} - (\\mu t_n) \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} \\right) = \\frac{1}{k_t} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu t_n}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} \\right) \\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}} $$\nThe magnitude of the plastic slip increment $\\Delta \\gamma = \\|\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t\\|$ is:\n$$ \\Delta \\gamma = \\frac{1}{k_t} \\left| 1 - \\frac{\\mu t_n}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} \\right| \\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| = \\frac{1}{k_t} (\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| - \\mu t_n) $$\nThe absolute value is removed because in the slip case, $\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| > \\mu t_n$. The updated plastic slip is $\\mathbf{p}_t^{n+1} = \\mathbf{p}_t^n + \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t$.\n\nA special case arises if $t_n = 0$. The friction limit is $0$. Any non-zero trial traction will induce slip. The final traction $\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}$ will be $\\mathbf{0}$. This corresponds to free slip.\n\nProof of Discrete Dissipation Inequality\nThe discrete dissipation per unit area is defined as $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t$. We must prove that $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} \\ge 0$ for any valid update.\n\nCase I: Stick Condition ($\\Phi^{\\text{trial}} \\le 0$)\nIn this case, $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore,\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} \\cdot \\mathbf{0} = 0 $$\nThe dissipation is zero, satisfying the inequality $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} \\ge 0$.\n\nCase II: Slip Condition ($\\Phi^{\\text{trial}} > 0$)\nIn this case, we have:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\left( (\\mu t_n) \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{k_t} (\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| - \\mu t_n) \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\frac{\\mu t_n}{k_t} (\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| - \\mu t_n) \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\|} \\right) $$\nThe dot product of the unit vector with itself is $1$. So,\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\frac{\\mu t_n}{k_t} (\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| - \\mu t_n) $$\nAlternatively, and more simply, using $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t$ and the flow rule $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t = \\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|}$, we get:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{D} = \\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1} \\cdot \\left(\\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|}\\right) = \\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|^2}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\|} = \\Delta \\gamma \\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{n+1}\\| = \\Delta \\gamma (\\mu t_n) $$\nIn the slip case, we know $\\Delta \\gamma = \\frac{1}{k_t}(\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| - \\mu t_n) > 0$ because $k_t>0$ and $\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\text{trial}}\\| > \\mu t_n$. Also, $\\mu \\ge 0$ and $t_n \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, the product $\\Delta \\mathcal{D} = (\\mu t_n) \\Delta \\gamma$ is guaranteed to be non-negative. It is strictly positive unless $\\mu=0$ or $t_n=0$, in which case the friction limit is zero, slip occurs without resistance, and dissipation is zero. This is physically correct.\nThe proof is complete. The algorithm is thermodynamically consistent.\n\nSummary of the Algorithm for Implementation:\n1.
