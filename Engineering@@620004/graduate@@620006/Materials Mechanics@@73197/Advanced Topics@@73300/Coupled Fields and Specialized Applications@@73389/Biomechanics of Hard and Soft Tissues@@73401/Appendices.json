This exercise explores the direct kinematic consequences of this fundamental property under two common experimental idealizations: plane stress and plane strain. By working from first principles, you will see how the incompressibility constraint, $J = \\det \\boldsymbol{F} = 1$, directly governs the lateral contraction of a tissue during uniaxial stretching, a foundational concept in soft tissue mechanics [@problem_id:2868824].", "problem": "A homogeneous, isotropic, hyperelastic soft tissue is modeled as incompressible, so that the local volume ratio satisfies $J=\\det \\boldsymbol{F}=1$ everywhere, where $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is the deformation gradient.

Case B (plane strain):\n    -   Kinematic constraint: $\\lambda_3 = 1$.\n    -   Traction-free face: $\\sigma_2 = 0$.\n\nThe problem is determined to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in continuum mechanics, grounded in fundamental principles. The premises are scientifically sound idealizations commonly used in the biomechanics of soft tissues. The problem is objective, self-contained, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It requests a derivation based only on the provided kinematic and boundary conditions, which is a standard procedure. Therefore, a solution will be formulated.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the incompressibility constraint to each of the two cases. The incompressibility constraint states that the volume ratio $J$ is unity. For a deformation describe by principal stretches $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$, the volume ratio is the product of the principal stretches:\n$$J = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1$$\nGiven the imposed axial stretch $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$, this equation becomes:\n$$\\lambda \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1$$\nThis is the governing kinematic equation from which the lateral stretches $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$ will be determined for each case.\n\nCase A: Plane Stress\n\nIn this case, the boundary conditions are given in terms of stresses: $\\sigma_2 = 0$ and $\\sigma_3 = 0$. The problem also states that the material is isotropic and that the setup is symmetric with respect to the interchange of directions $\\boldsymbol{e}_2$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$. For an isotropic material, the constitutive response (the relationship between deformation and stress) is independent of the orientation of the coordinate system. If the boundary conditions in two directions are identical ($\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3 = 0$), and the material itself has no preferred direction, then the resulting deformation must also be identical in those directions. This is an application of Curie's principle, which states that the symmetries of the causes must be found in the effects. The identical traction-free boundary conditions on the faces normal to $\\boldsymbol{e}_2$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$ are the cause, and the resulting stretches are the effect. Therefore, we must have equality of the lateral stretches:\n$$\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3$$\nThis equality is the explicit justification required by the problem statement.\n\nNow, we substitute this condition into the incompressibility equation:\n$$\\lambda \\lambda_2 \\lambda_2 = 1$$\n$$\\lambda (\\lambda_2)^2 = 1$$\nSolving for $\\lambda_2$ yields:\n$$(\\lambda_2)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\nSince a stretch ratio must be a positive real number, we take the positive square root:\n$$\\lambda_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\lambda}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$$\nFrom the symmetry condition, it follows that:\n$$\\lambda_3 = \\lambda_2 = \\lambda^{-1/2}$$\nSo, for the plane stress case, the lateral stretches are $\\lambda_{2}^{\\mathrm{(ps)}} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$ and $\\lambda_{3}^{\\mathrm{(ps)}} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$.\n\nCase B: Plane Strain\n\nIn this case, the conditions are specified kinematically. The specimen is constrained such that there is no strain in the $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$ direction. This is defined as:\n$$\\lambda_3 = 1$$\nThe problem also states that the face normal to direction $\\boldsymbol{e}_2$ is traction-free, so $\\sigma_2 = 0$. However, to find the unknown stretch $\\lambda_2$, we only need the kinematic constraints and the incompressibility condition. The stress condition $\\sigma_2 = 0$ is not required for determining the kinematics (it would be used subsequently to determine the reaction stress $\\sigma_3$ if a constitutive model for the material were provided).\n\nWe use the incompressibility equation $\\lambda \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1$ and substitute the known values for this case, $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$ and $\\lambda_3 = 1$:\n$$\\lambda \\cdot \\lambda_2 \\cdot 1 = 1$$\nSolving for $\\lambda_2$ is now trivial:\n$$\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\lambda^{-1}$$\nSo, for the plane strain case, the lateral stretches are $\\lambda_{2}^{\\mathrm{(pe)}} = \\lambda^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_{3}^{\\mathrm{(pe)}} = 1$.\n\nFinal Compilation of Results\n\nThe problem requires reporting the final answer as a row matrix containing the four entries $(\\lambda_{2}^{\\mathrm{(ps)}}, \\lambda_{3}^{\\mathrm{(ps)}}, \\lambda_{2}^{\\mathrm{(pe)}}, \\lambda_{3}^{\\mathrm{(pe)}})$.\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n- $\\lambda_{2}^{\\mathrm{(ps)}} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$\n- $\\lambda_{3}^{\\mathrm{(ps)}} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$\n- $\\lambda_{2}^{\\mathrm{(pe)}} = \\lambda^{-1}$\n- $\\lambda_{3}^{\\mathrm{(pe)}} = 1$\n\nThe resulting matrix is composed of these four expressions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} & \\frac{1}{\\lambda} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2868824"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the kinematics of incompressible materials, this problem delves into constitutive modeling, which connects deformation to stress.

The shielding contribution is this energy per unit area of crack advance, $dE_m / (d(\\Delta a) \\cdot 1)$.\n$$\\Delta R_{m,sat} = w_m \\ell_m$$\nUsing consistent SI units: $w_m = 1.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{J/m^3}$ and $\\ell_m = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\Delta R_{m,sat} = (1.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{J/m^3}) (0.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 200\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$$\n\n**Assemble and Evaluate $R(\\Delta a)$ at $\\Delta a = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$:**\nNow, we calculate the individual contributions at $\\Delta a = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe exponential arguments are:\n-   For bridging: $-\\Delta a/L_b = -0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm} / 1.5\\ \\mathrm{mm} = -1/3$.\n-   For microcracking: $-\\Delta a/L_m = -0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm} / 0.25\\ \\mathrm{mm} = -2$.\n\nThe contributions are:\n$$\\Delta R_b(0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}) = (225\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}) \\left(1 - \\exp(-1/3)\\right) \\approx (225)(1 - 0.71653) \\approx (225)(0.28347) \\approx 63.78\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$$\n$$\\Delta R_m(0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}) = (200\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}) \\left(1 - \\exp(-2)\\right) \\approx (200)(1 - 0.13534) \\approx (200)(0.86466) \\approx 172.93\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$$\n\nThe total resistance is the sum of all components:\n$$R(0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}) = R_0 + \\Delta R_b(0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}) + \\Delta R_m(0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm})$$\n$$R(0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}) \\approx 200 + 63.78 + 172.93 = 436.71\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$$\nThis value is correctly approximated as $R(0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}) \\approx 437\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Stability of Crack Growth at $\\Delta a = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$**\n\nFor quasi-static crack growth under displacement control, the condition for stability is that the slope of the resistance curve must be greater than the slope of the applied energy release rate curve.\nStability condition: $$\\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta a)} > \\frac{dG_{\\mathrm{app}}}{d(\\Delta a)}$$\nThe slope of the applied driving force is given as $S = dG_{\\mathrm{app}}/d(\\Delta a) = 180\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2\\ per\\ mm}$.\n\nWe must compute the slope of the R-curve, $dR/d(\\Delta a)$, by differentiating the expression for $R(\\Delta a)$.\n$$\\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta a)} = \\frac{d}{d(\\Delta a)} \\left[ R_0 + \\Delta R_{b,sat} (1 - \\exp(-\\Delta a/L_b)) + \\Delta R_{m,sat} (1 - \\exp(-\\Delta a/L_m)) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta a)} = \\frac{\\Delta R_{b,sat}}{L_b}\\exp(-\\Delta a/L_b) + \\frac{\\Delta R_{m,sat}}{L_m}\\exp(-\\Delta a/L_m)$$\nEvaluating at $\\Delta a = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta a)}\\bigg|_{\\Delta a=0.50} = \\frac{225\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}}{1.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}}\\exp(-1/3) + \\frac{200\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}}{0.25\\ \\mathrm{mm}}\\exp(-2)$$\n$$\\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta a)}\\bigg|_{\\Delta a=0.50} = (150\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2/mm})\\exp(-1/3) + (800\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2/mm})\\exp(-2)$$\n$$\\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta a)}\\bigg|_{\\Delta a=0.50} \\approx (150)(0.71653) + (800)(0.13534) \\approx 107.48 + 108.27 \\approx 215.75\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2/mm}$$\n\nNow we compare the slopes:\n$$\\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta a)} \\approx 215.75\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2/mm} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dG_{\\mathrm{app}}}{d(\\Delta a)} = 180\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2/mm}$$\nSince $215.75 > 180$, the condition for stability is met.
