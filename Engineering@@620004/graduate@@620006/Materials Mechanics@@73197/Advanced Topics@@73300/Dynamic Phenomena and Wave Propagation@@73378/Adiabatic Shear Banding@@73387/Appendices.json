It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and requires a solution based on fundamental physical principles. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe formation of an adiabatic shear band is governed by the competition between two processes: heat generation from mechanical work and heat conduction away from the band. We are tasked to find the characteristic time scales for each process.\n\nFirst, we consider the thermal diffusion process. The temperature evolution $T(x, t)$ within the band is described by the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nHere, $t$ is time and $x$ is the spatial coordinate across the band thickness. A characteristic time scale, which we shall denote $\\tau_{th}$, can be found by dimensional analysis of this equation. We approximate the derivatives using characteristic quantities. The characteristic length scale for diffusion is the thickness of the band, $h$. The temporal derivative can be approximated as $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau_{th}}$, and the spatial second derivative as $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T}{h^2}$, where $\\Delta T$ is a characteristic temperature change.\nSubstituting these into the heat equation gives a balance of scales:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau_{th}} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{h^2}\n$$\nSolving for the thermal diffusion time scale, $\\tau_{th}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\tau_{th} = \\frac{h^2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis represents the characteristic time required for heat to diffuse across the distance $h$.\n\nNext, we derive the characteristic time scale for mechanical deformation. The problem provides the imposed shear strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}$. By definition, the strain rate is the rate of change of strain, $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}\n$$\nA characteristic time scale for the mechanical process, $\\tau_{mech}$, is the time required to accumulate a significant amount of strain. In the context of large plastic deformation and flow localization, it is standard to consider a characteristic strain of order unity, i.e., $\\Delta \\gamma \\sim 1$. Using a finite difference approximation, $\\dot{\\gamma} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma}{\\tau_{mech}}$. With $\\Delta \\gamma \\sim 1$, we find the mechanical deformation time scale to be:\n$$\n\\tau_{mech} = \\frac{1}{\\dot{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis represents the characteristic time over which significant plastic straining occurs.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ratio $R$ of the thermal diffusion time scale to the deformation time scale:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_{th}}{\\tau_{mech}} = \\frac{h^2 / \\alpha}{1 / \\dot{\\gamma}} = \\frac{h^2 \\dot{\\gamma}}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis dimensionless ratio compares the time needed for heat to escape the band with the time it takes to generate that heat through deformation. If $R \\gg 1$, deformation is much faster than thermal diffusion, leading to a temperature rise and thermal softening, which are the conditions for *adiabatic* shear.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $R$.

The rate of plastic work per unit volume is $\\dot{W}_p = \\tau \\dot{\\gamma}$. The rate of heat generation is thus $\\beta \\tau \\dot{\\gamma}$.

The rate of plastic shear strain $\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{p}}$ is driven by the overstress, which is the difference between the magnitude of the shear stress and the current flow strength $g(x,t)$. For monotonic positive shear, this is:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{p}}(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\langle \\tau(x,t) - g(x,t) \\rangle\n    $$\n    where $\\eta$ is the viscosity parameter and $\\langle a \\rangle = \\max(a, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Flow Strength Evolution**: The flow strength $g$ evolves due to strain hardening and thermal softening:\n    $$\n    g(x,t) = \\left(\\sigma_{y0}(x) + H \\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}(x,t)\\right) \\phi\\left(T(x,t)\\right)\n    $$\n    - $\\sigma_{y0}(x)$ is the initial yield strength, with a small imperfection to trigger localization: $\\sigma_{y0}(x) = 1 - d_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-0.5)^{2}}{2 w^{2}}\\right)$.\n    - $H$ is the constant hardening modulus.\n    - $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}$ is the nonlocal equivalent plastic strain, obtained from the regularization procedure.\n    - $\\phi(T)$ is the thermal softening function: $\\phi(T) = \\max\\left(1 - a_{T}[T(x,t)-T_{0}], \\varepsilon_{\\phi}\\right)$.\n\n5.  **Energy Balance**: Under adiabatic conditions, the temperature increase is due to the portion of plastic work converted into heat:\n    $$\n    \\dot{T}(x,t) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\rho c} \\tau(x,t) \\dot{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{p}}(x,t)\n    $$\n    where $\\beta$ is the Taylor-Quinney coefficient and $\\rho c$ is the volumetric heat capacity.\n\n6.  **Gradient Regularization**: To ensure mesh objectivity, the local plastic strain $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}} \\equiv \\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}$ is regularized using an implicit gradient model. The nonlocal strain $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}$ is the solution to the Helmholtz equation:\n    $$\n    \\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}(x,t) - \\ell^{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} = \\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}(x,t)\n    $$\n    with periodic boundary conditions. The parameter $\\ell$ is an intrinsic material length scale.\n\nThe numerical solution is implemented using an explicit forward Euler time-stepping scheme on a uniform spatial grid of $N$ nodes with spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$. The state variables $\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}(x_i, t_n)$ and $T(x_i, t_n)$ are updated at each node $x_i$ for each time step $t_n = n\\Delta t$.\n\nThe algorithm for a single time step from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ is as follows:\n1.  Known states at $t_n$: $\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}_n$, $T_n$, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}_n$.\n2.  Compute total strain: $\\gamma_{n+1} = \\dot{\\gamma} t_{n+1}$.\n3.  Compute stress: $\\tau_n = G(\\dot{\\gamma}t_n - \\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}_n)$.\n4.  Compute flow strength: $g_n = (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}_n) \\max(1 - a_T(T_n - T_0), \\varepsilon_\\phi)$.\n5.  Compute plastic strain rate: $\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{p}}_n = \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\max(0, \\tau_n - g_n)$.\n6.  Update plastic strain: $\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1} = \\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}_n + \\dot{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{p}}_n \\Delta t$.\n7.  Update temperature: $T_{n+1} = T_n + \\frac{\\beta}{\\rho c} \\tau_n \\dot{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{p}}_n \\Delta t$.\n8.  Update nonlocal strain: The Helmholtz equation is solved in Fourier space due to its convolutional nature and the periodic boundary conditions.\n    - Compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the updated local plastic strain: $\\widehat{\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}}_{n+1} = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1}\\}$.\n    - The differentiation operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ becomes multiplication by $-k^2$ in Fourier space, where $k$ is the angular wavenumber. The Helmholtz equation becomes algebraic: $\\widehat{\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}}_{n+1} (1 + \\ell^2 k^2) = \\widehat{\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}}_{n+1}$.\n    - Solve for the DFT of the nonlocal strain: $\\widehat{\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}}_{n+1}(k) = \\frac{\\widehat{\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}}_{n+1}(k)}{1 + \\ell^2 k^2}$. The wavenumbers $k$ are given by $k_j = 2\\pi j/L$ for discrete frequencies. For $\\ell=0$, this reduces to $\\widehat{\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}} = \\widehat{\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}}$, meaning $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}} = \\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}$, recovering the local model.\n    - Compute the inverse DFT to obtain the nonlocal strain in real space: $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\widehat{\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}}_{n+1}\\}$.\n\nThis time-stepping procedure is repeated until the final simulation time $t_f = \\gamma_f/\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n\nFinally, the shear band thickness is measured at the final state $t_f$. The thickness is defined as the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the final plastic strain profile $\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}(x, t_f)$. We first identify the maximum value $\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}_{\\max}$ and its location $x_{\\max}$. Then, we find the largest contiguous spatial region around $x_{\\max}$ where $\\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}(x, t_f) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma^{\\mathrm{p}}_{\\max}$. The length of this region is the FWHM. The algorithm implemented searches outwards from the peak to find the boundaries of this region.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure for the four specified test cases, calculates the band thicknesses, and evaluates the two boolean conditions for mesh objectivity. The results demonstrate that without regularization ($\\ell=0$), the predicted band thickness is pathologically dependent on the mesh size, shrinking as the mesh is refined. With gradient regularization ($\\ell>0$), the band thickness converges to a finite, mesh-independent value related to the intrinsic length scale $\\ell$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test suite for the adiabatic shear banding problem\n    and print the results in the specified format.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    test_cases = [\n        # (l, N)\n        (0.0, 400),\n        (0.0, 1600),\n        (0.01, 400),\n        (0.01, 1600),\n    ]\n\n    fwhm_results = []\n    for l_val, N_val in test_cases:\n        fwhm = run_simulation(l_val, N_val)\n        fwhm_results.append(fwhm)\n\n    # Unpack results for clarity\n    fwhm_0_400, fwhm_0_1600, fwhm_0p01_400, fwhm_0p01_1600 = fwhm_results\n    \n    # Define tolerance for mesh objectivity check\n    tau_rel = 0.2\n\n    # Check for mesh objectivity\n    # Unregularized case: expect False (thickness depends on mesh)\n    if fwhm_0_400 > 0:\n        b_unreg = abs(fwhm_0_400 - fwhm_0_1600) <= tau_rel * fwhm_0_400\n    else:\n        # If no band forms, difference is 0, so it would be True. \n        # But this case is unlikely and implies no mesh dependency, which is not the point.\n        # So we can consider it False if no band forms for one and not the other.\n        # A simple check is sufficient.\n        b_unreg = fwhm_0_400 == fwhm_0_1600\n\n    # Gradient-regularized case: expect True (thickness is objective)\n    if fwhm_0p01_400 > 0:\n        b_grad = abs(fwhm_0p01_400 - fwhm_0p01_1600) <= tau_rel * fwhm_0p01_400\n    else:\n        b_grad = fwhm_0p01_400 == fwhm_0p01_1600\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    final_output = f\"[{fwhm_0_400},{fwhm_0_1600},{fwhm_0p01_400},{fwhm_0p01_1600},{b_unreg},{b_grad}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\ndef run_simulation(l_val, N_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a 1D simulation of adiabatic shear banding for a given set of\n    regularization length (l) and number of nodes (N).\n    \n    Returns the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the final plastic strain profile.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
