It presents a classical exercise in continuum mechanics, specifically the theory of elastic waves. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental equation governing the motion of a continuous medium is the balance of linear momentum, which in its local form is Cauchy's first law of motion. For a solid of mass density $\\rho$ subjected to a stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and a body force per unit volume $\\mathbf{b}$, this law is expressed as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{b} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is the displacement vector field. The problem states that body forces are absent, so $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation of motion thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\n\nThe material is specified as a homogeneous, linear, isotropic, elastic solid undergoing infinitesimal motions. The constitutive relation connecting the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ for such a material is given by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda (\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})) \\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. The infinitesimal strain tensor is related to the displacement field by:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right) $$\nThe trace of the strain tensor, $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})$, represents the volumetric strain and is equal to the divergence of the displacement field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$. Substituting this into the constitutive relation yields:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} + \\mu \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right) $$\n\nWe now substitute this expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ into the equation of motion:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\left[ \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} + \\mu \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right) \\right] = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\nFor a homogeneous material, $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are constants. Using the vector calculus identities $\\nabla \\cdot (f \\mathbf{I}) = \\nabla f$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T) = \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$, the divergence term expands as:\n$$ \\lambda \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\mu \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nThis leads to the Navier-Cauchy equation, which is the governing equation for wave propagation in the specified medium:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\n\nTo find the conditions for plane wave propagation, we seek a solution of the form:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\mathbf{A} \\exp \\left[ i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t) \\right] $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}$ is the constant polarization vector, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. We compute the necessary derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} = -\\omega^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\exp \\left[ i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t) \\right] = i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) $$\n$$ \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = -\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\exp \\left[ i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t) \\right] = -\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) $$\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = -|\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\mathbf{u} = -k^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nSubstituting these derivatives into the Navier-Cauchy equation gives:\n$$ -(\\lambda + \\mu) \\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) - \\mu k^2 \\mathbf{u} = -\\rho \\omega^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nDividing by the common exponential factor and rearranging, we obtain Christoffel's equation for an isotropic medium, which is the governing condition for plane waves:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\mu) \\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) + \\mu k^2 \\mathbf{A} = \\rho \\omega^2 \\mathbf{A} $$\n\nWe analyze two distinct cases for the orientation of the polarization vector $\\mathbf{A}$ relative to the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nCase 1: Longitudinal (Compressional) Wave\nThe particle displacement is parallel to the direction of wave propagation, i.e., $\\mathbf{A} \\parallel \\mathbf{k}$. This implies $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = k A$ (assuming $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ point in the same direction) and $\\mathbf{k} = k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ is a unit vector. The equation becomes:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\mu) (k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}) (k A) + \\mu k^2 (A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}) = \\rho \\omega^2 (A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}) $$\n$$ \\left( (\\lambda + \\mu) k^2 + \\mu k^2 \\right) A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = \\rho \\omega^2 A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nSince $A \\neq 0$, we have $(\\lambda + 2\\mu) k^2 = \\rho \\omega^2$. The phase velocity $c_p$ is defined as $\\omega/k$. Thus, we find:\n$$ \\rho c_p^2 = \\lambda + 2\\mu \\implies c_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda + 2\\mu}{\\rho}} $$\n\nCase 2: Transverse (Shear) Wave\nThe particle displacement is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, i.e., $\\mathbf{A} \\perp \\mathbf{k}$. This means $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = 0$. Christoffel's equation simplifies significantly:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\mu) \\mathbf{k}(0) + \\mu k^2 \\mathbf{A} = \\rho \\omega^2 \\mathbf{A} $$\n$$ \\mu k^2 \\mathbf{A} = \\rho \\omega^2 \\mathbf{A} $$\nThis gives $\\mu k^2 = \\rho \\omega^2$. The phase velocity of the transverse wave, $c_s$, is therefore:\n$$ \\rho c_s^2 = \\mu \\implies c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the velocities in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. The relations between these constants and the Lamé parameters are:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $c_s$ and $c_p$:\nFor the shear wave velocity $c_s$:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{2\\rho(1+\\nu)}} $$\nFor the compressional wave velocity $c_p$, we first compute $\\lambda + 2\\mu$:\n$$ \\lambda + 2\\mu = \\frac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} + 2 \\left( \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} \\right) = \\frac{E \\nu + E(1-2\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$\nThus, the compressional wave velocity is:\n$$ c_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{\\rho(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values using the provided data: $E = 210 \\text{ GPa} = 210 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.28$, and $\\rho = 7800 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\n\nCalculation for $c_s$:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{210 \\times 10^9}{2(7800)(1+0.28)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{210 \\times 10^9}{2(7800)(1.28)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{210 \\times 10^9}{19968}} \\approx 3242.965 \\text{ m/s} $$\nExpressed in km/s and rounded to four significant figures, $c_s = 3.243 \\text{ km/s}$.\n\nCalculation for $c_p$:\n$$ c_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(210 \\times 10^9)(1-0.28)}{(7800)(1+0.28)(1-2(0.28))}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(210 \\times 10^9)(0.72)}{(7800)(1.28)(0.44)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.512 \\times 10^{11}}{4392.96}} \\approx 5866.742 \\text{ m/s} $$\nExpressed in km/s and rounded to four significant figures, $c_p = 5.867 \\text{ km/s}$.\n\nThe final requested answer is the row vector containing $c_p$ and $c_s$ in that order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5.867 & 3.243\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2882137"}, {"introduction": "Having established the behavior of waves in isotropic media, we now advance to the more complex and realistic scenario of anisotropic materials.

All presented equations—the strain-displacement relation, the isotropic constitutive law (Hooke's law), and the linear momentum balance (Cauchy's first law of motion)—are fundamental and correct. The limit $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ while holding $\\mu$ constant is the standard and rigorous method for deriving the theory of incompressible elastic solids from the theory of compressible (\"nearly incompressible\") elastic solids. The relationship between this limit and Poisson's ratio $\\nu \\to 1/2$ is also standard. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A detailed solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nFirst, we substitute the constitutive relation into the momentum balance to obtain the equation of motion for the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$.\n$$ \\rho \\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\lambda \\,\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\mathbf{I} + 2 \\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) + \\mathbf{b} $$\nUsing the definition of strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top})$ and the identity $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\rho \\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} + \\mu (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^{\\top})) + \\mathbf{b} $$\nUsing the vector identities $\\nabla \\cdot (\\phi \\mathbf{I}) = \\nabla \\phi$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$, this simplifies to the Navier-Cauchy equation:\n$$ \\rho \\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} = (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{b} $$\n\nFor bulk plane waves in the absence of body forces ($\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$), we seek solutions of the form $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\mathbf{A} e^{i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t)}$. The Helmholtz decomposition allows us to separate $\\mathbf{u}$ into a longitudinal (irrotational) part and a transverse (solenoidal) part. This leads to two types of waves:\n1.  **Longitudinal waves (P-waves):** The displacement is parallel to the direction of propagation. Their phase speed $c_P$ is given by:\n    $$ c_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda + 2\\mu}{\\rho}} $$\n2.  **Transverse waves (S-waves):** The displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Their phase speed $c_S$ is given by:\n    $$ c_S = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}} $$\n\nNow, we analyze the incompressible limit. The Lamé parameter $\\lambda$ is related to the shear modulus $\\mu$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ by $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\mu\\nu}{1-2\\nu}$. The problem specifies the limit $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ while $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ are held constant. From the relation, this limit corresponds precisely to $\\nu \\to 1/2$.\nIn this limit:\n-   The S-wave speed $c_S = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\rho}$ remains a finite, non-zero constant because $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ are fixed.\n-   The P-wave speed $c_P = \\sqrt{(\\lambda + 2\\mu)/\\rho}$ approaches infinity.\n\nThe strain energy density $W$ for a linear elastic material is $W = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda(\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}))^2 + \\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. With $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$, this is $W = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})^2 + \\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. For the strain energy to remain finite in any motion as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, the volumetric strain must vanish, i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. This is the kinematic constraint of incompressibility.\n\nThis constraint has profound implications. For a P-wave, the displacement $\\mathbf{u}$ is longitudinal, meaning $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\neq 0$. The infinite energy density required for such a wave implies that P-waves cannot propagate in the bulk of an incompressible material. The infinite speed $c_P$ can be interpreted as the speed at which the incompressibility constraint is enforced throughout the material; any volumetric disturbance is instantaneously counteracted everywhere.\n\nFor the formal treatment of an incompressible material, the constitutive law is reformulated. The stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is decomposed into a deviatoric part $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$, which causes shape change, and a spherical part (related to pressure), which causes volume change. In the incompressible limit, the volume cannot change, so the pressure is not determined by the strain. It becomes an independent variable, a Lagrange multiplier $p$ that enforces the constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. The constitutive law becomes:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} $$\nNote that since $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, the strain tensor is purely deviatoric ($\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$).\n\nSubstituting this incompressible constitutive law into the momentum balance $\\rho \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{b}$ yields:\n$$ \\rho \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} = \\nabla \\cdot (-p\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) + \\mathbf{b} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^{\\top}) + \\mathbf{b} $$\nUsing $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$ and the constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, the equation of motion for an incompressible elastic solid becomes:\n$$ \\rho \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{b} $$\nTo find an equation for the pressure field $p$, we take the divergence of this equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}}) = -\\nabla^2 p + \\mu \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{b} $$\nUsing the commutativity of divergence with the time derivative and Laplacian operators, and the constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, we have $\\nabla \\cdot \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}) = \\nabla^2(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0$. This leaves:\n$$ 0 = -\\nabla^2 p + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nabla^2 p = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{b} $$\nThis is a Poisson equation for the pressure $p$. It is an elliptic partial differential equation, not a hyperbolic wave equation. This means that the pressure field $p$ at any time $t$ is determined by the body force field $\\mathbf{b}$ over the entire domain at that same instant $t$ (subject to boundary conditions). It does not \"propagate\" as a wave.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In the limit $\\nu \\to 1/2$ with $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ fixed, finite-energy bulk waves must satisfy $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, so the only propagating bulk waves are purely transverse; their finite phase speed is determined by $\\mu$ and $\\rho$.**\nAs derived, for the strain energy density $W = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})^2 + \\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ to remain finite as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, it must be that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. This is the incompressibility constraint. A wave with $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\neq 0$ is a longitudinal (P-wave) component. A wave with $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ is a transverse (S-wave) component. Thus, P-waves are suppressed, and only transverse waves can propagate. The phase speed of these transverse waves is $c_S = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\rho}$, which is finite and constant since $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ are fixed. This statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In the limit $\\nu \\to 1/2$, the phase speed of volumetric (dilatational) plane waves tends to $0$, so longitudinal waves become evanescent.**\nThe phase speed of volumetric (P-wave) waves is $c_P = \\sqrt{(\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho}$. Since the limit is taken with $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ while $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ are fixed positive constants, $c_P \\to \\infty$. The statement claims the speed tends to $0$. This is factually incorrect. Longitudinal waves do not become evanescent; they are suppressed because their propagation would require infinite energy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In the incompressible formulation, the stress may be written as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\,\\mathbf{I} + 2 \\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $p$ is a pressure-like Lagrange multiplier enforcing $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ and is not constitutively related to volumetric strain.**\nThis is the standard and correct formulation for stress in an incompressible material. In the compressible case, the mean stress is constitutively tied to volumetric strain via the bulk modulus, $K$. In the incompressible limit, $K \\to \\infty$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\to 0$, making their product indeterminate. This indeterminate part of the spherical stress is identified as $-p$, a pressure field that acts as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the kinematic constraint of incompressibility. It is determined by the equations of motion and boundary conditions, not by a constitutive relation involving strain.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. In the incompressible limit with a body force $\\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, the pressure field $p$ is constrained by an elliptic equation of the form $\\nabla^{2} p = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$ (with appropriate boundary conditions), not a wave equation, so $p$ does not propagate as an independent bulk wave.**\nAs derived earlier, taking the divergence of the incompressible momentum equation directly leads to the Poisson equation $\\nabla^2 p = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$. This is an elliptic PDE. Unlike hyperbolic wave equations, elliptic equations model equilibrium or steady-state phenomena, implying that information (about the source $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$) is transmitted instantaneously throughout the domain. This mathematical property reflects the physical concept of an infinite P-wave speed. Therefore, the pressure field $p$ adjusts \"instantly\" and does not propagate as a wave with finite speed.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. As $\\nu \\to 1/2$, the transverse wave speed vanishes because it depends on $\\nu$ and is driven to zero by the incompressibility constraint.**\nThe transverse wave speed is $c_S = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\rho}$. The problem explicitly states that the limit is taken while holding $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ constant. Therefore, $c_S$ remains a finite, non-zero constant. The incompressibility constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ primarily affects longitudinal motion, not transverse motion. This statement is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2882150"}]}
