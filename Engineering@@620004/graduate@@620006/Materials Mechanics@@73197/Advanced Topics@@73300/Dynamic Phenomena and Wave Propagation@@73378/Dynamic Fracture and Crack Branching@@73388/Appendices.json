The exact form of this equation is a cubic equation in $c_{R}^{2}$ and is cumbersome to solve directly. The problem statement permits the use of a well-tested approximation. A highly accurate and widely used approximation for $c_{R}$ as a function of Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ and shear wave speed $c_{s}$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{c_{R}}{c_{s}} \\approx \\frac{0.862 + 1.14\\nu}{1 + \\nu} $$\nThis approximation is valid for the entire physical range of Poisson's ratio, $0 \\le \\nu \\le 0.5$.\n\nWe are given the material parameters $\\nu = 0.33$ and $c_{s} = 2000\\,\\text{m/s}$.

For a crack to propagate, $G(v)$ must be at least equal to the material's fracture toughness, $\\Gamma$. A key result from the theory for a mode I crack in an isotropic elastic material is that the energy release rate is a function of crack speed, typically expressed as:\n$$ G(v) = A_{I}(v) G_{\\text{static}} $$\nwhere $G_{\\text{static}}$ is the energy release rate for a stationary crack under the same loading, and $A_{I}(v)$ is a universal, decreasing function of crack speed $v$. This function depends on the material's wave speeds but not the geometry or loading specifics.\n\nCrucially, the function $A_{I}(v)$ approaches zero as the crack speed $v$ approaches the Rayleigh wave speed $c_{R}$:\n$$ \\lim_{v \\to c_{R}} A_{I}(v) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the energy flow to the crack tip diminishes as it accelerates, and it would become zero if the crack speed were to reach $c_{R}$. Since a finite amount of energy ($G \\ge \\Gamma > 0$) must be supplied to create new fracture surfaces, a single tensile crack cannot physically reach the Rayleigh wave speed. Thus, $c_{R}$ serves as a strict theoretical upper bound on crack propagation speed, dictated by the energy balance.\n\nCrack branching is an instability that occurs at a critical speed $v_c$ that is significantly below $c_{R}$. This phenomenon is also understood through analysis of the dynamic fields near the crack tip. As crack speed increases, the distribution of stress around the tip changes markedly. Yoffe's analysis of the dynamic stress field for a fast-moving crack showed that beyond a certain speed, the maximum hoop stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$, is no longer located directly ahead of the crack ($\\theta=0$) but bifurcates into two maxima at symmetric angles of approximately $\\theta \\approx \\pm 60^{\\circ}$.\n\nThis change in the stress field signifies that straight-ahead propagation is no longer the path of maximum tensile stress. The material is most highly stressed off the primary crack plane, making it favorable to initiate new cracks, or branches, at these angles. The onset of this stress-field bifurcation provides the mechanical trigger for crack branching.\n\nThe macroscopic energy perspective and the local stress-field perspective are complementary. As a single crack accelerates, its ability to absorb energy from the surrounding elastic field diminishes (as $G(v)$ decreases). When the loading system provides more energy than the single tip can dissipate, the system becomes unstable. The crack branches into multiple tips, thereby creating more surface area and providing a more efficient mechanism for dissipating the stored elastic energy. This instability occurs at a speed $v_{c} < c_{R}$, pre-empting the crack from ever reaching its theoretical limit. Therefore, $c_{R}$ defines the ultimate speed limit, but the dynamic instability of branching sets a lower, practical limit on the maximum observable speed of a single crack.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1862}\n$$", "id": "2626640"}, {"introduction": "Having established the ultimate speed limit, we now investigate a primary mechanism for crack branching: an energetic instability.
