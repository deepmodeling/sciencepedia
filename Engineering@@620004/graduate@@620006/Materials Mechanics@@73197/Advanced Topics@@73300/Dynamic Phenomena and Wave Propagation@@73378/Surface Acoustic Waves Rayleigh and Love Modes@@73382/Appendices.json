A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem demands the derivation of the secular equation for Rayleigh surface waves. We begin with the assumption of a two-dimensional displacement field $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, 0, u_3)$ in a half-space defined by $x_3 \\ge 0$, with wave propagation along the $x_1$-axis. The governing equation is the Navier-Cauchy equation for elastodynamics:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} = (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nThe displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ is decomposed using the Helmholtz decomposition into a scalar potential $\\phi$ and a vector potential $\\boldsymbol{\\psi} = (0, \\psi, 0)$: $\\mathbf{u} = \\nabla \\phi + \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\psi}$. This decouples the Navier equation into two independent wave equations:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{1}{c_P^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial t^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nabla^2 \\psi = \\frac{1}{c_S^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2}\n$$\nwhere $c_P = \\sqrt{(\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho}$ and $c_S = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\rho}$ are the bulk longitudinal and shear wave speeds, respectively.\n\nWe seek time-harmonic solutions of the form $\\phi(x_1, x_3, t) = \\Phi(x_3) e^{i(kx_1 - \\omega t)}$ and $\\psi(x_1, x_3, t) = \\Psi(x_3) e^{i(kx_1 - \\omega t)}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and the phase velocity is $c_R = \\omega/k$. For a surface wave, the displacement must decay as $x_3 \\to \\infty$. This condition requires evanescent solutions of the form:\n$$\n\\Phi(x_3) = A e^{-q x_3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Psi(x_3) = B e^{-s x_3}\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. The decay parameters $q$ and $s$ are real and positive, defined as:\n$$\nq = k\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{c_R^2}{c_P^2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = k\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{c_R^2}{c_S^2}}\n$$\nThis requires $c_R < c_S < c_P$.\n\nThe traction-free boundary condition at the surface $x_3=0$ requires that the stress components $\\sigma_{33}$ and $\\sigma_{13}$ must vanish. By substituting the harmonic potential solutions into the constitutive relations for an isotropic elastic solid and applying the boundary conditions, we obtain a system of two homogeneous linear equations for the amplitudes $A$ and $B$. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the system's matrix must be zero. This condition leads to the secular equation for Rayleigh waves. A standard form of this equation is:\n$$\n(2k^2 - k_S^2)^2 = 4k^2qs\n$$\nwhere $k_S = \\omega/c_S$ is the shear wavenumber. To obtain a form suitable for numerical solution, we nondimensionalize this equation. Let $\\xi = c_R/c_S$ and $\\eta = c_S/c_P$. The terms can be rewritten using the definitions of $c_R$, $q$, and $s$: $k_S^2 = k^2\\xi^2$, $q = k\\sqrt{1-\\xi^2\\eta^2}$, and $s = k\\sqrt{1-\\xi^2}$. Substituting these into the secular equation and dividing by $k^4$ gives:\n$$\n(2-\\xi^2)^2 = 4\\sqrt{1-\\xi^2}\\sqrt{1-\\xi^2\\eta^2}\n$$\nTo eliminate the square roots, which can introduce numerical difficulties, we square both sides:\n$$\n(2-\\xi^2)^4 = 16(1-\\xi^2)(1-\\xi^2\\eta^2)\n$$\nLetting $X = \\xi^2$, we obtain a polynomial equation in $X$. After expansion and simplification, this reduces to the Rayleigh cubic equation:\n$$\nX^3 - 8X^2 + 8(3-2\\eta^2)X - 16(1-\\eta^2) = 0\n$$\nThe parameter $\\eta^2$ is related to Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ through the elastic constants:\n$$\n\\eta^2 = \\frac{c_S^2}{c_P^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda+2\\mu} = \\frac{E/[2(1+\\nu)]}{E(1-\\nu)/[(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)]} = \\frac{1-2\\nu}{2(1-\\nu)}\n$$\nFor the physically stable range of Poisson's ratio $-1 < \\nu < 0.5$, the parameter $\\eta^2$ lies in the range $0 < \\eta^2 < 3/4$.\n\nThe final algorithm involves solving this cubic equation for $X = \\xi^2$. It can be shown that for any valid $\\nu$, this equation has exactly one root $X$ in the physically meaningful interval $(0, 1)$. We define a function $f(X) = X^3 - 8X^2 + 8(3-2\\eta^2)X - 16(1-\\eta^2)$. We note that $f(0) = -16(1-\\eta^2) < 0$ and $f(1) = 1-8+24-16\\eta^2-16+16\\eta^2 = 1 > 0$. Therefore, a root is guaranteed to exist in $(0, 1)$ by the Intermediate Value Theorem. This root can be found efficiently using a robust numerical method such as Brent's method.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, calculate $\\eta^2 = \\frac{1-2\\nu}{2(1-\\nu)}$.\n2.  Define the coefficients of the cubic polynomial $f(X) = 0$.\n3.  Numerically solve for the root $X$ in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n4.  Calculate the desired ratio $\\xi = \\sqrt{X}$.\n5.  The values for $E$ and $\\rho$ are not required for computing the ratio $\\xi$, but are necessary to compute the dimensional wave speeds $c_S$ and $c_R$ if needed.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elastodynamics, is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It poses a standard perturbation problem in the study of surface acoustic waves. We may therefore proceed to a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the first-order fractional change in the Rayleigh wave phase speed, $\\Delta c_R / c_R$, due to the addition of a thin surface mass layer of density $m$ per unit area. This is a classic perturbation problem that can be solved efficiently using a variational energy-based method, specifically an application of Rayleigh's principle for propagating waves. This principle is derived from the fundamental elastodynamic equations provided in the problem statement.\n\nRayleigh's principle, when applied to a propagating wave mode, allows for the calculation of a shift in frequency or wavenumber due to a small perturbation in the system's properties. For a change in frequency $\\Delta\\omega$ at a fixed wavenumber $k$, the principle gives the relation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\omega} \\approx \\frac{\\langle \\Delta W_e \\rangle - \\langle \\Delta W_k \\rangle}{2\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total}}\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\Delta W_e \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\Delta W_k \\rangle$ are the time-averaged potential and kinetic energies added by the perturbation, respectively, and $\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total}$ is the total time-averaged kinetic energy of the unperturbed wave mode. For a propagating mode in an elastic medium, there is an equipartition of energy, such that the total time-averaged kinetic energy equals the total time-averaged strain energy, $\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total} = \\langle W_e \\rangle_{total}$.\n\nIn this problem, the perturbation is a pure mass loading, meaning it adds kinetic energy but no potential (strain) energy. Therefore, $\\langle \\Delta W_e \\rangle = 0$. The phase speed is $c_R = \\omega/k$. A perturbation at fixed wavenumber $k$ implies $\\Delta c_R / c_R = \\Delta \\omega / \\omega$. Thus, the fractional change in phase speed is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c_R}{c_R} = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\omega} \\approx -\\frac{\\langle \\Delta W_k \\rangle}{2\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total}}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that adding mass to the system decreases the wave speed, a physically correct conclusion.\n\nOur task now is to compute the two energy terms using the provided field representations. All energy terms are calculated per unit area of the surface in the $xy$-plane.\n\nFirst, we calculate the added time-averaged kinetic energy, $\\langle \\Delta W_k \\rangle$, due to the surface mass $m$. The particle velocity is $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}} = \\partial_t \\mathbf{u}$. With $\\mathbf{u}(x,z,t) = \\Re\\{\\mathbf{U}(z)\\exp[i(kx-\\omega t)]\\}$, the velocity at the surface $z=0$ is $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(x,0,t) = \\Re\\{-i\\omega\\mathbf{U}(0)\\exp[i(kx-\\omega t)]\\}$. The kinetic energy per unit area of the mass layer is $\\frac{1}{2}m|\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(x,0,t)|^2$. The time-average of $|\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}|^2$ over one period is $\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2|\\mathbf{U}|^2$.\nTherefore, the time-averaged added kinetic energy is:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta W_k \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} m \\omega^2 |\\mathbf{U}(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{4} m \\omega^2 \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right)\n$$\nSecond, we calculate the total time-averaged kinetic energy of the unperturbed Rayleigh wave, $\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total}$, integrated over the depth of the half-space. The time-averaged kinetic energy density at a depth $z$ is $\\langle w_k(z) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\omega^2|\\mathbf{U}(z)|^2$. Integrating this from $z=0$ to $z=\\infty$ gives:\n$$\n\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total} = \\int_0^\\infty \\langle w_k(z) \\rangle \\,dz = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\omega^2 |\\mathbf{U}(z)|^2 \\,dz\n$$\n$$\n\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total} = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\omega^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz\n$$\nNow, we substitute these energy expressions into the perturbation formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c_R}{c_R} \\approx - \\frac{\\frac{1}{4} m \\omega^2 \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right)}{2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\omega^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz \\right]}\n$$\nThe terms $\\frac{1}{4}\\omega^2$ cancel, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c_R}{c_R} = - \\frac{m \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right)}{2 \\rho \\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz}\n$$\nThe final step is to express this result in terms of the given dimensionless parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\Lambda$.\nThe definitions are:\n$$\n\\gamma \\equiv \\frac{|U_z(0)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda \\equiv \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{|U_x(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2}+\\frac{|U_z(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2}\\right)\\,dz\n$$\nTo utilize these definitions, we factor out $|U_x(0)|^2$ from our expression.\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\nm \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right) = m |U_x(0)|^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{|U_z(0)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2} \\right) = m |U_x(0)|^2 (1+\\gamma)\n$$\nThe denominator's integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz = |U_x(0)|^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\frac{|U_x(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2} + \\frac{|U_z(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2} \\right) \\,dz = |U_x(0)|^2 \\Lambda\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\Delta c_R / c_R$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c_R}{c_R} = - \\frac{m |U_x(0)|^2 (1+\\gamma)}{2 \\rho |U_x(0)|^2 \\Lambda}\n$$\nThe term $|U_x(0)|^2$ cancels, as it must, for the result to be independent of the wave amplitude.
