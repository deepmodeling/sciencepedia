Both media are homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly elastic. Neglect material attenuation and dispersion over the frequency range of interest. The aluminum has mass density $\\rho_{1}=2700$ kg/m$^{3}$ and longitudinal wave speed $c_{p1}=6320$ m/s; the PMMA has mass density $\\rho_{2}=1180$ kg/m$^{3}$ and longitudinal wave speed $c_{p2}=2730$ m/s.\n\nStarting from the one-dimensional linear momentum balance, the linear elastic constitutive relation for longitudinal motion, and the plane-wave kinematics, derive the relations between the complex amplitudes of normal stress and particle velocity for forward and backward propagating longitudinal plane waves in each medium.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of materials mechanics, specifically concerning the one-dimensional propagation, reflection, and transmission of elastic waves at a planar interface. All necessary material properties and conditions are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution as requested.\n\nThe fundamental equations governing one-dimensional longitudinal motion in a linear elastic medium are the linear momentum balance, the linear elastic constitutive relation, and the kinematic relations. We shall use the convention where tension is positive stress and particle motion in the positive $x$-direction is positive velocity.\n\nThe one-dimensional linear momentum balance is Newton's second law applied to a continuum element:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial t}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{xx}$ is the normal stress in the $x$-direction, $\\rho$ is the mass density, and $v_x$ is the particle velocity in the $x$-direction.\n\nThe one-dimensional linear elastic constitutive relation (Hooke's Law) for longitudinal motion is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = M \\epsilon_{xx} = M \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $u_x$ is the particle displacement, $\\epsilon_{xx}$ is the longitudinal strain, and $M$ is the appropriate longitudinal modulus. For a P-wave in an isotropic, extended medium, this modulus is $M = \\lambda + 2\\mu$, where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lam√© constants. This modulus is related to the density and longitudinal wave speed $c_p$ by $M = \\rho c_{p}^{2}$.\n\nThe particle velocity $v_x$ is the time derivative of the displacement $u_x$: $v_x = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial t}$.\n\nFor a time-harmonic plane wave with angular frequency $\\omega$, we assume solutions of the form $f(x,t) = F(x) \\exp(-i\\omega t)$, where $F(x)$ is the complex spatial amplitude. The governing equations become:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\Sigma(x)}{d x} = -i \\omega \\rho V(x) \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma(x) = \\rho c_{p}^{2} \\frac{d U(x)}{d x} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\nV(x) = -i \\omega U(x) \\quad (3)\n$$\nwhere $\\Sigma(x)$, $V(x)$, and $U(x)$ are the complex amplitudes of stress, velocity, and displacement, respectively.\n\nFrom $(3)$, we have $U(x) = \\frac{i}{\\omega} V(x)$. Substituting this into $(2)$ gives $\\Sigma(x) = \\rho c_{p}^{2} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{i}{\\omega} V(x)\\right)$, which leads to $\\frac{d V(x)}{d x} = \\frac{-i\\omega}{\\rho c_{p}^{2}} \\Sigma(x)$. Combining this with equation $(1)$ yields a second-order wave equation for the stress amplitude:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\Sigma(x)}{d x^2} = -i \\omega \\rho \\frac{d V(x)}{d x} = -i \\omega \\rho \\left( \\frac{-i\\omega}{\\rho c_{p}^{2}} \\Sigma(x) \\right) = - \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c_p}\\right)^2 \\Sigma(x) = -k^2 \\Sigma(x)\n$$\nwhere $k = \\omega/c_p$ is the wavenumber. The general solution for $\\Sigma(x)$ is a superposition of forward- and backward-propagating waves:\n$$\n\\Sigma(x) = S_f \\exp(ikx) + S_b \\exp(-ikx)\n$$\nwhere the full solution is $\\sigma_{xx}(x,t) = (\\Sigma(x)) \\exp(-i\\omega t) = S_f \\exp(i(kx - \\omega t)) + S_b \\exp(i(-kx - \\omega t))$. The term with $S_f$ propagates in the $+x$ direction, and the term with $S_b$ propagates in the $-x$ direction.\n\nTo find the relationship between stress and velocity, we consider each wave component separately.\nFor a forward-propagating wave, $\\Sigma_f(x) = S_f \\exp(ikx)$. From equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(S_f e^{ikx}) = ik S_f e^{ikx} = -i\\omega \\rho V_f(x) \\implies ik \\Sigma_f(x) = -i\\omega \\rho V_f(x)\n$$\nSolving for the ratio $\\Sigma_f / V_f$ and substituting $k=\\omega/c_p$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Sigma_f(x)}{V_f(x)} = -\\frac{\\omega\\rho}{k} = -\\frac{\\omega\\rho}{\\omega/c_p} = -\\rho c_p = -Z\n$$\nwhere $Z = \\rho c_p$ is the specific acoustic impedance of the medium.\n\nFor a backward-propagating wave, $\\Sigma_b(x) = S_b \\exp(-ikx)$. From equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(S_b e^{-ikx}) = -ik S_b e^{-ikx} = -i\\omega \\rho V_b(x) \\implies -ik \\Sigma_b(x) = -i\\omega \\rho V_b(x)\n$$\nSolving for the ratio $\\Sigma_b / V_b$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Sigma_b(x)}{V_b(x)} = \\frac{\\omega\\rho}{k} = \\frac{\\omega\\rho}{\\omega/c_p} = \\rho c_p = Z\n$$\nSo, for complex amplitudes, the relations are: $S_f = -Z V_f$ for forward waves and $S_b = Z V_b$ for backward waves.\n\nNow, we apply these results to the interface problem.\nIn medium $1$ (Aluminum, $x<0$), we have the incident (forward, $I$) and reflected (backward, $R$) waves.

Substitute $S_{2,T}$ from (A) into (B):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{Z_1} (-S_{1,I} + S_{1,R}) = -\\frac{1}{Z_2} (S_{1,I} + S_{1,R})\n$$\nMultiply by $Z_1 Z_2$ and divide by $S_{1,I}$:\n$$\nZ_2 (-1 + \\mathcal{R}) = -Z_1 (1 + \\mathcal{R})\n$$\n$$\n-Z_2 + \\mathcal{R}Z_2 = -Z_1 - \\mathcal{R}Z_1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(Z_1 + Z_2) = Z_2 - Z_1\n$$\nThis yields the desired expression for the stress reflection coefficient:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\mathcal{R}$. The impedances are:\n$Z_1 = \\rho_1 c_{p1} = (2700 \\text{ kg/m}^3)(6320 \\text{ m/s}) = 17064000 \\text{ kg m}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1} = 17.064 \\times 10^6$ Rayl.\n$Z_2 = \\rho_2 c_{p2} = (1180 \\text{ kg/m}^3)(2730 \\text{ m/s}) = 3221400 \\text{ kg m}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1} = 3.2214 \\times 10^6$ Rayl.\nSince impedances are real, the reflection coefficient $\\mathcal{R}$ is real.\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{3.2214 \\times 10^6 - 17.064 \\times 10^6}{3.2214 \\times 10^6 + 17.064 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{-13.8426 \\times 10^6}{20.2854 \\times 10^6} = -0.682390...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathcal{R} = -0.6824$.\nIn rectangular form, this is $-0.6824 + 0i$.\nThe magnitude is $|\\mathcal{R}| = 0.6824$. Since $\\mathcal{R}$ is a negative real number, its phase is $\\arg(\\mathcal{R}) = \\pi$ radians. The negative sign signifies a $180^\\circ$ phase shift upon reflection, meaning a compressive incident stress pulse reflects as a tensile pulse.\n\nFinally, we verify energy flux conservation. The time-averaged power flux (intensity) is given by $I = -\\frac{1}{2} \\text{Re}\\{S V^*\\}$. The negative sign ensures that for a forward-propagating wave, where compressive stress ($\\sigma<0$) is associated with positive velocity ($v>0$), the power flow is positive.\nIncident flux: $I_I = -\\frac{1}{2}\\text{Re}\\{S_{1,I} V_{1,I}^*\\} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\text{Re}\\{S_{1,I} (-S_{1,I}/Z_1)^*\\} = \\frac{1}{2Z_1}\\text{Re}\\{S_{1,I} S_{1,I}^*\\} = \\frac{|S_{1,I}|^2}{2Z_1}$.

This is positive (flow in $+x$ direction).\nConservation of energy requires that the incident power equals the sum of the outgoing powers: $I_I = I_T - I_R$.\n$$\n\\frac{|S_{1,I}|^2}{2Z_1} = \\frac{|S_{2,T}|^2}{2Z_2} + \\frac{|S_{1,R}|^2}{2Z_1}\n$$\nDividing by $I_I = |S_{1,I}|^2/(2Z_1)$ gives the relation for power coefficients:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}\\left|\\frac{S_{2,T}}{S_{1,I}}\\right|^2 + \\left|\\frac{S_{1,R}}{S_{1,I}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}|\\mathcal{T}|^2 + |\\mathcal{R}|^2\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{T} = S_{2,T}/S_{1,I}$ is the stress transmission coefficient. From equation (A), $\\mathcal{T} = 1 + \\mathcal{R}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$:\n$$\n|\\mathcal{R}|^2 + \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}|\\mathcal{T}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\\right)^2 + \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}\\left(1 + \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{(Z_2 - Z_1)^2}{(Z_2 + Z_1)^2} + \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}\\left(\\frac{Z_2 + Z_1 + Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{Z_2^2 - 2Z_1Z_2 + Z_1^2}{(Z_2 + Z_1)^2} + \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}\\frac{(2Z_2)^2}{(Z_2 + Z_1)^2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{Z_2^2 - 2Z_1Z_2 + Z_1^2 + 4Z_1Z_2}{(Z_2 + Z_1)^2} = \\frac{Z_2^2 + 2Z_1Z_2 + Z_1^2}{(Z_2 + Z_1)^2} = \\frac{(Z_2 + Z_1)^2}{(Z_2 + Z_1)^2} = 1\n$$\nThis completes the symbolic verification of energy conservation.\nNumerically, the power reflection coefficient is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{power}} = |\\mathcal{R}|^2 = (-0.6824)^2 \\approx 0.4657$.\nThe transmission coefficient is $\\mathcal{T} = 1+\\mathcal{R} = 1 - 0.6824 = 0.3176$.\nThe power transmission coefficient is $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{power}} = \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}|\\mathcal{T}|^2 = \\frac{17.064}{3.2214} (0.3176)^2 \\approx (5.2967)(0.10087) \\approx 0.5343$.\nThe sum is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{power}} + \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{power}} \\approx 0.4657 + 0.5343 = 1.0000$.

The described physical system and the questions asked are standard in advanced mechanics. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivations\n\n**Task 1: Incremental Stresses for SH Waves**\nThe problem states that the only nonzero incremental displacement component is $u_3(x_1, x_2, t)$. The incremental strain tensor components are $\\delta \\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_i u_j + \\partial_j u_i)$.\nThe only nonzero components of the incremental strain tensor are:\n$$ \\delta \\epsilon_{13} = \\delta \\epsilon_{31} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_1} $$\n$$ \\delta \\epsilon_{23} = \\delta \\epsilon_{32} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_2} $$\nFor a linearly elastic isotropic material, the incremental stress-strain relation (Hooke's Law) is $\\delta \\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\delta \\epsilon_{kk} + 2G \\delta \\epsilon_{ij}$, where $\\lambda$ is the Lam√© first parameter and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nThe trace of the strain tensor, or the volumetric strain, is $\\delta \\epsilon_{kk} = \\delta \\epsilon_{11} + \\delta \\epsilon_{22} + \\delta \\epsilon_{33} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\nConsequently, the incremental normal stresses are all zero:\n$$ \\delta \\sigma_{11} = \\delta \\sigma_{22} = \\delta \\sigma_{33} = \\lambda(0) + 2G(0) = 0 $$\nThis directly shows that the incremental normal traction at the interface, $\\delta \\sigma_{22}$, vanishes.\nThe nonzero incremental shear stresses are:\n$$ \\delta \\sigma_{13} = 2G \\delta \\epsilon_{13} = G \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_1} $$\n$$ \\delta \\sigma_{23} = 2G \\delta \\epsilon_{23} = G \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_2} $$\nThe incremental shear traction on the interface $x_2=0$ is $\\delta \\sigma_{23}$, which is confirmed to depend on the gradient $\\partial u_3 / \\partial x_2$. This completes the first task.\n\n**Task 2: Incremental Interfacial Boundary Conditions**\nThe total stress is the sum of the pre-stress and the incremental stress, $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij}^0 + \\delta \\sigma_{ij}$.\nThe total normal stress at the interface is $\\sigma_{22} = \\sigma_{22}^0 + \\delta \\sigma_{22} = -p_0 + 0 = -p_0$.\nThe total shear stress at the interface is $\\sigma_{23} = \\sigma_{23}^0 + \\delta \\sigma_{23} = t_0 + \\delta \\sigma_{23}$.\nThe Coulomb friction law relates the magnitude of the tangential traction $|\\vec{t}|$ to the normal compressive stress $- \\sigma_{22}$. For SH motion, the only tangential traction is $\\sigma_{23}$, so the law is $|\\sigma_{23}| \\leq f(-\\sigma_{22})$.\n\n**(i) Sticking Regime: $|t_0| < f p_0$**\nFor sticking to be maintained, two conditions must be met:\n1.  **Kinematic Condition:** There is no incremental relative slip. Since the half-spaces are identical, this means the displacement must be continuous across the interface: $\\llbracket \\delta u_3 \\rrbracket = 0$. The notation $\\llbracket \\cdot \\rrbracket$ represents the jump $F(x_2=0^+) - F(x_2=0^-)$.\n2.  **Traction Continuity:** Linear momentum balance across the interface requires that the traction vector is continuous: $\\llbracket \\delta \\sigma_{23} \\rrbracket = 0$.\nThese conditions, $\\llbracket \\delta u_3 \\rrbracket = 0$ and $\\llbracket \\delta \\sigma_{23} \\rrbracket = 0$, define a perfectly bonded interface for the incremental field.\n3.  **Self-Consistency:** The total shear stress must remain within the Coulomb cone: $|t_0 + \\delta \\sigma_{23}| < f p_0$. For small perturbations, this requires that the amplitude of the oscillatory stress $|\\delta \\sigma_{23}|$ is smaller than the available frictional resistance: $|\\delta \\sigma_{23}| < f p_0 - |t_0|$. This is satisfiable for sufficiently small wave amplitudes.\n\n**(ii) Steady Sliding Regime: $|t_0| = f p_0$**\nIn this regime, the interface is at the threshold of sliding. The friction law is an equality: $|\\sigma_{23}| = f(-\\sigma_{22})$. The direction of the shear stress is fixed by the direction of sliding. Let us assume the background state is sliding, or on the verge of sliding, such that the direction of slip does not change due to the small perturbation.\nThe total stress must satisfy this condition throughout the motion:\n$$ \\sigma_{23}^0 + \\delta \\sigma_{23} = \\pm f (-(\\sigma_{22}^0 + \\delta \\sigma_{22})) $$\nThe sign depends on the direction of sliding. Let's assume $\\sigma_{23}^0 = t_0 = f p_0$.\n$$ f p_0 + \\delta \\sigma_{23} = f (p_0 - \\delta \\sigma_{22}) = f p_0 - f \\delta \\sigma_{22} $$\nThis simplifies to $\\delta \\sigma_{23} = - f \\delta \\sigma_{22}$.\nAs we proved in Task 1, for SH waves, $\\delta \\sigma_{22} = 0$. Therefore, the linearized boundary condition for the sliding regime is:\n$$ \\delta \\sigma_{23} = 0 $$\nThis means that for the incremental wave field, the interface behaves as a traction-free surface.\n\n**Task 3: Reflection and Transmission Coefficients**\nWe consider a system of incident (I), reflected (R), and transmitted (T) plane waves. The displacement fields are:\n-   In upper half-space ($x_2 > 0$): $u_3^{(+)}(x_1, x_2, t) = \\left( A_I e^{-ik_2 x_2} + A_R e^{ik_2 x_2} \\right) e^{i(k_1 x_1 - \\omega t)} $\n-   In lower half-space ($x_2 < 0$): $u_3^{(-)}(x_1, x_2, t) = A_T e^{-ik_2 x_2} e^{i(k_1 x_1 - \\omega t)} $\nwhere $k_1 = (\\omega/c_s)\\sin\\theta$ and $k_2 = (\\omega/c_s)\\cos\\theta$. The reflection and transmission coefficients are $R = A_R / A_I$ and $T = A_T / A_I$.\n\nThe incremental shear traction is $\\delta \\sigma_{23} = G \\partial u_3 / \\partial x_2$.\n-   At $x_2=0^+$: $\\delta \\sigma_{23}^{(+)} = G (-ik_2 A_I + ik_2 A_R) = ik_2 G (A_R - A_I)$.\n-   At $x_2=0^-$: $\\delta \\sigma_{23}^{(-)} = G (-ik_2 A_T) = -ik_2 G A_T$.\nThe displacements at the interface $x_2=0$ are:\n-   At $x_2=0^+$: $u_3^{(+)} = A_I + A_R$.\n-   At $x_2=0^-$: $u_3^{(-)} = A_T$.\n\n**Analysis of Sticking Regime:**\nThe boundary conditions are $\\llbracket u_3 \\rrbracket = 0$ and $\\llbracket \\delta \\sigma_{23} \\rrbracket = 0$.\n1.  $A_I + A_R = A_T$\n2.  $ik_2 G (A_R - A_I) = -ik_2 G A_T \\implies A_I - A_R = A_T$\nAdding the two equations gives $2 A_I = 2 A_T \\implies A_I = A_T$.\nSubtracting the second from the first gives $2 A_R = 0 \\implies A_R = 0$.\nThus, the coefficients are $R = A_R/A_I = 0$ and $T = A_T/A_I = 1$. This corresponds to perfect transmission with no reflection.\n\n**Analysis of Sliding Regime:**\nThe boundary condition is $\\delta \\sigma_{23} = 0$ at the interface for both half-spaces.\n1.  On the upper side ($x_2=0^+$): $\\delta \\sigma_{23}^{(+)} = 0 \\implies ik_2 G (A_R - A_I) = 0$. Since $k_2, G \\neq 0$, this implies $A_R - A_I = 0$, so $A_R = A_I$.\n2.  On the lower side ($x_2=0^-$): $\\delta \\sigma_{23}^{(-)} = 0 \\implies -ik_2 G A_T = 0$, which implies $A_T = 0$.\nThus, the coefficients are $R = A_R/A_I = 1$ and $T = A_T/A_I = 0$. This corresponds to total reflection and zero transmission.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. In steady sliding with Coulomb friction, the small-on-large linearization for SH waves yields the incremental interfacial condition $\\delta \\sigma_{23}+f\\,\\delta \\sigma_{22}=0$. Because SH motion gives $\\delta \\sigma_{22}=0$, it follows that $\\delta \\sigma_{23}=0$ at $x_2=0$. For identical half-spaces this enforces a traction-free boundary for the perturbation, giving total reflection with $|R|=1$ and zero transmission, $T=0$.**\nThis statement accurately presents the linearization of the Coulomb law for sliding. It correctly notes that $\\delta \\sigma_{22} = 0$ for SH waves, which correctly leads to the condition $\\delta \\sigma_{23} = 0$. It then correctly concludes that this traction-free condition for identical half-spaces results in total reflection ($R=1$, so $|R|=1$) and zero transmission ($T=0$). The entire chain of logic and the final result are consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the sticking regime about a strictly interior pre-stress state with $|t_0|<f\\,p_0$, the incremental conditions are no separation ($\\llbracket \\delta u_2 \\rrbracket=0$), no slip ($\\llbracket \\delta u_3 \\rrbracket=0$), and traction continuity. For identical half-spaces, a time-harmonic SH plane wave is transmitted without reflection, so $R=0$ and $T=1$. Moreover, sticking is self-consistent for sufficiently small amplitudes because the oscillatory increment $|\\delta \\sigma_{23}|$ can be made smaller than the margin $f\\,p_0-|t_0|$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the boundary conditions for sticking as continuity of displacement and traction. For identical materials, this is equivalent to a perfectly bonded interface. Our derivation shows this leads to perfect transmission ($T=1$) and no reflection ($R=0$). The statement about self-consistency for small amplitudes is also correct, as the incremental stress can be kept below the friction limit $f p_0 - |t_0|$ if the incident wave amplitude is small enough.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In steady sliding, the correct linearized Coulomb condition for SH waves is $\\delta \\sigma_{23}=-f\\,\\delta \\sigma_{22}\\neq 0$, and because SH motion always induces $\\delta \\sigma_{22}\\neq 0$, partial transmission occurs with $0<|R|<1$.**\nThis statement is founded on a false premise. As derived in Task 1, for pure SH kinematics, the incremental normal strains $\\delta\\epsilon_{ii}$ are zero, and thus the incremental normal stress $\\delta \\sigma_{22}$ is identically zero. The claim that $\\delta \\sigma_{22} \\neq 0$ for SH motion is fundamentally incorrect. This error invalidates the rest of the statement's conclusion about partial transmission.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Coulomb friction necessarily introduces incremental energy dissipation for any nonzero-amplitude SH reflection problem, implying $|R|<1$ even for identical half-spaces; therefore total reflection with $|R|=1$ cannot occur in the sliding regime.**\nThis statement makes an argument based on energy dissipation. In the sliding regime, slip occurs. The incremental slip is $\\llbracket \\delta u_3 \\rrbracket = u_3^{(+)} - u_3^{(-)} = (A_I+A_R) - A_T$. With $R=1$ and $T=0$, we have $\\llbracket \\delta u_3 \\rrbracket = 2 A_I \\neq 0$. The rate of energy dissipation per unit area is given by the product of the total shear stress and the total slip velocity. In a state of steady sliding, there is indeed dissipation. However, the implication that this dissipated energy must come from the wave, thereby requiring $|R|<1$, is flawed. In this specific model (constant kinetic friction), the energy for dissipation is provided by the work done by the constant background pre-stress $t_0$ on the incremental slip velocity $\\llbracket \\delta \\dot{u}_3 \\rrbracket$. The average power of this interaction over one wave cycle is zero. Thus, the wave's energy is conserved, allowing $|R|=1$. The statement incorrectly assumes the energy for frictional losses must be drawn from the wave's energy flux.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2929783"}, {"introduction": "Many advanced materials and geological structures feature continuously varying properties rather than sharp interfaces.

The first is an exact analytical solution, and the second is a discrete multilayer approximation.\n\n**Part 1: Analytical Solution for the Continuously Graded Layer**\n\nWe begin with the governing equations for one-dimensional SH wave motion, assuming a time-harmonic dependence of $e^{-i\\omega t}$. The displacement and stress fields are written as $u(z,t) = U(z)e^{-i\\omega t}$ and $\\tau(z,t) = T(z)e^{-i\\omega t}$, respectively.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Wave Equation:**\n    Substituting the time-harmonic forms into the governing equations yields a system of ordinary differential equations for the complex amplitudes $U(z)$ and $T(z)$:\n    - Conservation of momentum: $\\dfrac{dT}{dz} - \\rho(z)\\omega^2 U = 0$.\n    - Constitutive relation: $T(z) = \\mu(z) \\dfrac{dU}{dz}$.\n\n    For the graded layer, $\\rho(z) = \\rho$ is constant. Combining the two equations gives the second-order wave equation for the displacement amplitude $U(z)$:\n    $$\n    \\dfrac{d}{dz}\\left(\\mu(z) \\dfrac{dU}{dz}\\right) + \\rho\\omega^2 U(z) = 0, \\quad z \\in [0, H].\n    $$\n    The shear modulus is given by the linear profile $\\mu(z) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} + (\\mu_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}}) \\frac{z}{H}$. Let $m = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}})/H$. Then $\\mu(z) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} + mz$. The wave equation becomes:\n    $$\n    (\\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} + mz) \\dfrac{d^2U}{dz^2} + m \\dfrac{dU}{dz} + \\rho\\omega^2 U = 0.\n    $$\n\n2.  **Solution of the Wave Equation:**\n    To solve this equation, we introduce a change of variable. Let $\\xi(z) = \\mu(z) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} + mz$. The derivatives transform as $\\frac{d}{dz} = m \\frac{d}{d\\xi}$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dz^2} = m^2 \\frac{d^2}{d\\xi^2}$. The equation in terms of $\\xi$ is:\n    $$\n    \\xi \\left(m^2 \\dfrac{d^2U}{d\\xi^2}\\right) + m \\left(m \\dfrac{dU}{d\\xi}\\right) + \\rho\\omega^2 U = 0.\n    $$\n    Dividing by $m^2$, we obtain:\n    $$\n    \\xi \\dfrac{d^2U}{d\\xi^2} + \\dfrac{dU}{d\\xi} + k_m^2 U = 0,\n    $$\n    where $k_m = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho}\\omega}{m}$. To transform this into a standard form, let $s = 2k_m\\sqrt{\\xi}$. The chain rule gives $\\frac{d}{d\\xi} = \\frac{k_m}{\\sqrt{\\xi}}\\frac{d}{ds}$ and $\\frac{d^2}{d\\xi^2} = \\frac{k_m^2}{\\xi}\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} - \\frac{k_m^2}{2\\xi^{3/2}}\\frac{d}{ds}$. After substitution and simplification, the equation becomes Bessel's equation of order zero:\n    $$\n    s^2 \\dfrac{d^2U}{ds^2} + s \\dfrac{dU}{ds} + s^2 U = 0.\n    $$\n    The general solution for $U$ as a function of $s(z) = 2k_m\\sqrt{\\mu(z)}$ is a linear combination of Bessel functions of the first and second kind, of order zero:\n    $$\n    U(z) = C_1 J_0(s(z)) + C_2 Y_0(s(z)).\n    $$\n\n3.  **Mechanical Impedance Formulation:**\n    The mechanical impedance is defined as the ratio of shear stress to particle velocity, $Z(z) = \\tau(z,t) / v(z,t)$. With $v(z,t) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -i\\omega U(z)e^{-i\\omega t}$, the impedance is $Z(z) = T(z)/(-i\\omega U(z))$. The stress amplitude is $T(z) = \\mu(z)\\frac{dU}{dz}$. Using $\\frac{dJ_0(s)}{ds} = -J_1(s)$ and $\\frac{dY_0(s)}{ds} = -Y_1(s)$, and $\\frac{ds}{dz} = k_m m / \\sqrt{\\mu(z)}$, we find:\n    $$\n    T(z) = -k_m m \\sqrt{\\mu(z)} \\left[C_1 J_1(s(z)) + C_2 Y_1(s(z))\\right].\n    $$\n    The impedance in the layer is thus:\n    $$\n    Z(z) = \\frac{-k_m m \\sqrt{\\mu(z)} [C_1 J_1(s) + C_2 Y_1(s)]}{-i\\omega [C_1 J_0(s) + C_2 Y_0(s)]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho\\mu(z)}}{i} \\frac{C_1 J_1(s) + C_2 Y_1(s)}{C_1 J_0(s) + C_2 Y_0(s)}.\n    $$\n    The ratio of constants $C_1/C_2$ is determined by the boundary condition at $z=H$. The bottom half-space ($z>H$) supports only an outgoing wave, so its impedance is the characteristic impedance $Z_s = \\sqrt{\\rho_s \\mu_s} = \\sqrt{\\rho \\mu_b}$. By continuity, $Z(H) = Z_s$. Let $s_b = s(H) = 2k_m\\sqrt{\\mu_b}$.\n    $$\n    \\sqrt{\\rho\\mu_b} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho\\mu_b}}{i} \\frac{C_1 J_1(s_b) + C_2 Y_1(s_b)}{C_1 J_0(s_b) + C_2 Y_0(s_b)}.\n    $$\n    Solving for the ratio $K = C_1/C_2$ yields:\n    $$\n    K = \\frac{C_1}{C_2} = \\frac{Y_1(s_b) - iY_0(s_b)}{iJ_0(s_b) - J_1(s_b)}.\n    $$\n\n4.  **Reflection and Reflectance Calculation:**\n    The input impedance of the graded layer at $z=0$ is $Z_{\\text{in}} = Z(0)$. Let $s_t = s(0) = 2k_m\\sqrt{\\mu_t}$ and $Z_t = \\sqrt{\\rho\\mu_t}$.\n    $$\n    Z_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{Z_t}{i} \\frac{K J_1(s_t) + Y_1(s_t)}{K J_0(s_t) + Y_0(s_t)}.\n    $$\n    In the top half-space ($z<0$), the field is $u(z,t) = (U_{\\text{inc}}e^{ik_0z} + U_{\\text{refl}}e^{-ik_0z})e^{-i\\omega t}$, where $k_0=\\omega\\sqrt{\\rho_0/\\mu_0}$. The impedance at $z=0^-$ is $Z(0^-) = Z_t \\frac{1-R}{1+R}$, where $R = U_{\\text{refl}}/U_{\\text{inc}}$.\n    Equating impedances $Z(0^-) = Z_{\\text{in}}$ provides the reflection coefficient:\n    $$\n    R(\\omega) = \\frac{Z_t - Z_{\\text{in}}}{Z_t + Z_{\\text{in}}}.\n    $$\n    The power reflectance is $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = |R(\\omega)|^2$.\n\n**Part 2: Discrete Multilayer Approximation**\n\nThe graded layer is approximated by a stack of $N$ homogeneous sublayers, each of thickness $h = H/N$. The $j$-th layer ($j=1, \\dots, N$) has constant properties evaluated at its midpoint $z_j = (j-1/2)h$:\n$$\n\\rho_j = \\rho, \\quad \\mu_j = \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} + (\\mu_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}}) \\frac{z_j}{H}.\n$$\n\n1.  **Impedance Propagation:**\n    For a single homogeneous layer of thickness $h$, characteristic impedance $Z_c=\\sqrt{\\rho\\mu}$, and wavenumber $k=\\omega\\sqrt{\\rho/\\mu}$, loaded by an impedance $Z_L$, the input impedance $Z_{\\text{in}}$ at its top surface is given by:\n    $$\n    Z_{\\text{in}} = Z_c \\frac{Z_L \\cos(kh) - iZ_c \\sin(kh)}{Z_c \\cos(kh) - iZ_L \\sin(kh)}.\n    $$\n    This formula is derived by considering the general plane wave solution within the layer and applying impedance boundary conditions at its top and bottom.\n\n2.  **Iterative Algorithm:**\n    We compute the input impedance of the entire stack, $Z_{\\text{in},N}$, by iterating backward from the bottom sublayer to the top.\n    - **Initialization**: The load on the last sublayer ($j=N$) is the impedance of the bottom half-space: $Z_{\\text{load}}^{(N)} = Z_s = \\sqrt{\\rho\\mu_b}$.\n    - **Iteration**: For $j = N, N-1, \\dots, 1$:\n        a. Calculate properties for sublayer $j$: $Z_{c,j} = \\sqrt{\\rho\\mu_j}$ and $k_j = \\omega\\sqrt{\\rho/\\mu_j}$.\n        b. Calculate the input impedance $Z_{\\text{in}}^{(j)}$ using the formula above with $Z_{c,j}$, $k_j$, and the load $Z_{\\text{load}}^{(j)}$. For $j<N$, this load is the input impedance of the layer below it, i.e., $Z_{\\text{load}}^{(j)} = Z_{\\text{in}}^{(j+1)}$.\n    - **Termination**: After the loop, the final impedance $Z_{\\text{in},N} = Z_{\\text{in}}^{(1)}$ is the input impedance of the $N$-layer approximation at $z=0$.\n\n3.  **Approximate Reflectance:**\n    The approximate reflection coefficient $R_N(\\omega)$ and reflectance $\\mathcal{R}_N(\\omega)$ are calculated using this impedance:\n    $$\n    R_N(\\omega) = \\frac{Z_t - Z_{\\text{in},N}}{Z_t + Z_{\\text{in},N}}, \\quad \\mathcal{R}_N(\\omega) = |R_N(\\omega)|^2.\n    $$\n\n**Part 3: Computational Implementation**\n\nBoth derived formulations will be implemented in a single Python program. The program will loop through the specified test cases of frequency $f$ and number of sublayers $N$. For each case, it will compute $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)$ and $\\mathcal{R}_N(\\omega)$ where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, and then find their absolute difference.
