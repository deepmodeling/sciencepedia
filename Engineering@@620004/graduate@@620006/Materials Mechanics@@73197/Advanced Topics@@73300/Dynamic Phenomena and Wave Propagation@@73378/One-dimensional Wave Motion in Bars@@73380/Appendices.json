The expression for $N$ must be in terms of $\\tau$, $L$, and $c$.\n\nNext, we validate the problem. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a classical scenario in continuum mechanics governed by the one-dimensional wave equation. All terms are standard and clearly defined. The physical parameters $L$, $A$, $\\rho$, $E$, $c$, $\\sigma_0$, and $\\tau$ are sufficient for the question posed. The specification of the boundary at $x=L$ as \"perfectly reflecting\" is a standard idealization, implying no energy loss upon reflection. While it does not specify whether the end is fixed (zero displacement) or free (zero stress), this ambiguity does not affect the travel time of the wavefront, which is the only quantity needed to solve this particular problem. The time for a wave to travel a distance and return is independent of the phase change upon reflection. Therefore, the problem is self-contained and consistent for the question asked. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the system is that longitudinal disturbances in the bar propagate according to the one-dimensional wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the axial displacement at position $x$ and time $t$, and $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ is the longitudinal wave speed.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the application of a traction pulse at $x=0$ generates a wavefront that propagates from $x=0$ towards the end at $x=L$. The speed of this wavefront is the constant wave speed $c$.\n\nThe time, $t_{0 \\to L}$, required for the leading wavefront to travel the length $L$ of the bar from $x=0$ to $x=L$ is:\n$$\nt_{0 \\to L} = \\frac{L}{c}\n$$\n\nUpon reaching the end at $x=L$, the wavefront is reflected. The problem states this end is \"perfectly reflecting\". The reflected wavefront then propagates back from $x=L$ towards $x=0$. The speed of the reflected wavefront is also $c$.\n\nThe time, $t_{L \\to 0}$, required for the reflected wavefront to travel the length $L$ of the bar from $x=L$ back to $x=0$ is:\n$$\nt_{L \\to 0} = \\frac{L}{c}\n$$\n\nA \"reflection event at the driven end\" is defined as the arrival of this wavefront back at $x=0$. The total time, $T_{event}$, for one complete round trip from $x=0$ to $x=L$ and back to $x=0$ is the sum of the travel times for each leg of the journey.\n$$\nT_{event} = t_{0 \\to L} + t_{L \\to 0} = \\frac{L}{c} + \\frac{L}{c} = \\frac{2L}{c}\n$$\nThis is the period of one reflection cycle. The first such event occurs at time $t_1 = T_{event}$. The second event, which corresponds to the wavefront completing a second round trip, occurs at time $t_2 = 2 T_{event}$. In general, the $k$-th reflection event at the driven end occurs at time $t_k$, where $k$ is a positive integer:\n$$\nt_k = k \\cdot T_{event} = k \\frac{2L}{c}\n$$\n\nWe are tasked to find $N$, the number of such reflection events that occur while the applied traction is still nonzero. The traction is nonzero for the time interval $0 \\le t \\le \\tau$. Therefore, we must count the number of events for which the time of occurrence $t_k$ is less than or equal to the pulse duration $\\tau$. This gives the condition:\n$$\nt_k \\le \\tau\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $t_k$:\n$$\nk \\frac{2L}{c} \\le \\tau\n$$\nTo find the possible values of $k$, we solve for $k$:\n$$\nk \\le \\frac{\\tau c}{2L}\n$$\nSince $N$ is the total count of such events, it must be the largest integer value of $k$ that satisfies this inequality. The largest integer less than or equal to a given real number is, by definition, the floor of that number. Thus, we have:\n$$\nN = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\tau c}{2L} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\n\nThis expression is a closed-form analytic result for $N$ in terms of the specified parameters $\\tau$, $L$, and $c$. We perform a dimensional analysis to check for consistency. The quantity inside the floor function is $\\frac{\\tau c}{2L}$. The dimensions of the parameters are $[\\tau] = T$, $[c] = L T^{-1}$, and $[L] = L$. The resulting dimension is:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\tau c}{2L}\\right] = \\frac{T \\cdot (L T^{-1})}{L} = \\frac{L}{L} = 1\n$$\nThe argument is dimensionless, as is required for the floor function and for a quantity representing a count.

Let $u(x,t)$ be the longitudinal displacement of a cross-section at position $x$ and time $t$. The bar occupies the region $x \\ge 0$.\n\nNewton's second law is applied to a differential element of the bar between $x$ and $x+dx$. The mass of this element is $dm = \\rho A dx$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. The net force on the element is due to the stress $\\sigma$. The force on the face at $x$ is $-A\\sigma(x,t)$ and on the face at $x+dx$ is $A\\sigma(x+dx,t)$. The net force is $dF = A\\sigma(x+dx,t) - A\\sigma(x,t) \\approx A \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} dx$. Newton's second law, $dF = (dm) \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}$, becomes:\n$$\nA \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} dx = (\\rho A dx) \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} \\implies \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nHooke's law for a linearly elastic material in one dimension relates stress $\\sigma$ to strain $\\epsilon$. The strain is the spatial derivative of displacement, $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\n$$\n\\sigma(x,t) = E \\epsilon(x,t) = E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus.\n\nSubstituting Hooke's law into Newton's law yields the one-dimensional wave equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nFor a uniform bar, $E$ and $\\rho$ are constant, leading to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{E}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\equiv c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ is the longitudinal wave speed.\n\nWe consider time-harmonic waves of angular frequency $\\omega$. The displacement, particle velocity $v = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$, and stress can be represented in complex form: $u(x,t) = \\hat{u}(x) e^{i\\omega t}$, $v(x,t) = \\hat{v}(x) e^{i\\omega t}$, $\\sigma(x,t) = \\hat{\\sigma}(x) e^{i\\omega t}$.\nFrom $v=\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$, we have $\\hat{v}(x) = i\\omega \\hat{u}(x)$.\nSubstituting the harmonic form for $u(x,t)$ into the wave equation gives the Helmholtz equation for the complex displacement amplitude $\\hat{u}(x)$:\n$$\n-\\omega^2 \\hat{u}(x) = c^2 \\frac{d^2 \\hat{u}}{dx^2} \\implies \\frac{d^2 \\hat{u}}{dx^2} + k^2 \\hat{u}(x) = 0\n$$\nwhere $k=\\omega/c$ is the wavenumber.\n\nThe general solution represents waves traveling in both directions. The problem states an incident wave from the interior of the bar ($x>0$) travels towards the termination at $x=0$. This is a wave traveling in the $-x$ direction. The reflected wave travels away from the termination, in the $+x$ direction.\nThe total particle velocity field is a superposition of incident ($I$) and reflected ($R$) waves:\n$$\nv(x,t) = (\\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} + \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx}) e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nHere, $\\hat{v}_{I}$ is the complex amplitude of the incident velocity wave at $x=0$, and $\\hat{v}_{R}$ is that of the reflected wave.\n\nThe corresponding stress field is found using the relation $\\sigma = E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = E \\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} dt$. In the frequency domain, $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\frac{E}{i\\omega} \\frac{d \\hat{v}}{dx}$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}(x) = \\frac{E}{i\\omega} (ik \\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} - ik \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx}) = \\frac{Ek}{\\omega} (\\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} - \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx})\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{Ek}{\\omega} = \\frac{E(\\omega/c)}{\\omega} = \\frac{E}{c} = \\frac{E}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}} = \\sqrt{E\\rho}$. This is the specific acoustic impedance of the bar material, which we denote as $Z_0 = \\sqrt{E\\rho}$.\nThus, the complex stress amplitude is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}(x) = Z_0 (\\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} - \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx})\n$$\n\nNext, we formulate the boundary condition at $x=0$. The end of the bar is connected to a linear viscous dashpot of coefficient $c_d$. The force exerted by the bar on the termination system at $x=0$ is $F_{bar} = A\\sigma(0,t)$. The dashpot is connected to a rigid wall, so its velocity is determined by the bar's end motion, $v(0,t)$. The force exerted by the dashpot on the bar is a resistive force, $F_{d} = -c_d v(0,t)$. By Newton's third law (action-reaction), the force exerted by the bar on the dashpot must be equal and opposite to the force exerted by the dashpot on the bar.\n$$\nF_{bar} = -F_{d} \\implies A\\sigma(0,t) = -(-c_d v(0,t)) = c_d v(0,t)\n$$\nIn terms of complex amplitudes, this boundary condition is:\n$$\nA \\hat{\\sigma}(0) = c_d \\hat{v}(0)\n$$\nWe evaluate the velocity and stress amplitudes at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(0) = \\hat{v}_{I} + \\hat{v}_{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}(0) = Z_0 (\\hat{v}_{I} - \\hat{v}_{R})\n$$\nSubstituting these into the boundary condition equation:\n$$\nA Z_0 (\\hat{v}_{I} - \\hat{v}_{R}) = c_d (\\hat{v}_{I} + \\hat{v}_{R})\n$$\nThe characteristic impedance of the bar is $Z_b = A Z_0 = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nZ_b (\\hat{v}_{I} - \\hat{v}_{R}) = c_d (\\hat{v}_{I} + \\hat{v}_{R})\n$$\nWe rearrange to solve for the reflection coefficient $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = \\hat{v}_{R}/\\hat{v}_{I}$:\n$$\nZ_b \\hat{v}_{I} - Z_b \\hat{v}_{R} = c_d \\hat{v}_{I} + c_d \\hat{v}_{R}\n$$\n$$\n(Z_b - c_d)\\hat{v}_{I} = (Z_b + c_d)\\hat{v}_{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_{R}}{\\hat{v}_{I}} = \\frac{Z_b - c_d}{Z_b + c_d}\n$$\nSubstituting $Z_b = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}$, we obtain the final expression for the reflection coefficient:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = \\frac{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d}{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} + c_d}\n$$\nThe parameters $A$, $E$, $\\rho$, and $c_d$ are all given as constants. Therefore, the reflection coefficient $\\mathcal{R}$ is independent of the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\nPart 2: Optimization of the Dashpot Coefficient $c_d$\n\nThe design objective is to minimize the cost functional:\n$$\nJ(c_{d}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}-\\omega_{1}} \\int_{\\omega_{1}}^{\\omega_{2}} \\left|\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)\\right|^{2}\\, \\mathrm{d}\\omega\n$$\nAs established in Part 1, $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)$ is not a function of $\\omega$. We denote it simply as $\\mathcal{R}$. The term $|\\mathcal{R}|^2$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $\\omega$.\n$$\nJ(c_d) = |\\mathcal{R}|^2 \\frac{1}{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1} \\int_{\\omega_1}^{\\omega_2} d\\omega = |\\mathcal{R}|^2 \\frac{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1}{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1} = |\\mathcal{R}|^2\n$$\nThe cost functional simplifies to the squared magnitude of the reflection coefficient:\n$$\nJ(c_d) = \\left| \\frac{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d}{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} + c_d} \\right|^2\n$$\nSince all quantities are real, this is:\n$$\nJ(c_d) = \\left( \\frac{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d}{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} + c_d} \\right)^2\n$$\nTo minimize $J(c_d)$, we must find the value of $c_d$ that minimizes this expression. The function $f(x) = (\\frac{a-x}{a+x})^2$ for positive $a$ and $x$ is minimized when its numerator is zero, provided the denominator is non-zero. The minimum value of $J(c_d)$ is $0$, which occurs when the numerator is zero.\n$$\nA\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d = 0\n$$\nThis gives the optimal dashpot coefficient:\n$$\nc_{d,opt} = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}\n$$\nThis condition is known as impedance matching, where the dashpot impedance $c_d$ is matched to the characteristic impedance of the bar $Z_b = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}$, resulting in zero reflection and perfect absorption of the incident wave energy.

It is a rigorous and self-contained exercise in wave propagation and impedance matching. A solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically addressing the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Characteristic Impedance and Inverse Problem**\n\nWe begin from the fundamental relations for harmonic waves. Assuming a time-dependence of $e^{i\\omega t}$, the partial derivatives with respect to time become multiplications by $i\\omega$. The axial force $F$ and particle velocity $v$ are represented by their complex amplitudes (phasors) $\\hat{F}(x)$ and $\\hat{v}(x)$. The governing equations for a uniform bar segment of area $A$ are derived as follows:\n\nThe momentum balance is $\\partial \\sigma/\\partial x = \\rho \\partial v/\\partial t$. Multiplying by $A$ and using $F=\\sigma A$ (for uniform $A$), we have $\\partial F/\\partial x = \\rho A \\partial v/\\partial t$. In the frequency domain, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{F}}{dx} = i\\omega \\rho A \\hat{v}\n$$\nThe constitutive relation is $\\sigma = E \\partial u/\\partial x$, so $F/A = E \\partial u/\\partial x$. The kinematic definition is $v = \\partial u/\\partial t$. Differentiating velocity with respect to position gives $\\partial v/\\partial x = \\partial(\\partial u/\\partial t)/\\partial x = \\partial(\\partial u/\\partial x)/\\partial t$. Substituting the constitutive relation, we get $\\partial v/\\partial x = \\frac{1}{E} \\frac{\\partial (F/A)}{\\partial t}$. In the frequency domain:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{v}}{dx} = \\frac{i\\omega}{EA} \\hat{F}\n$$\nThese two first-order equations can be combined into a second-order wave equation. Differentiating the first equation and substituting the second gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\hat{F}}{dx^2} = i\\omega \\rho A \\frac{d\\hat{v}}{dx} = i\\omega \\rho A \\left(\\frac{i\\omega}{EA}\\right) \\hat{F} = -\\frac{\\omega^2 \\rho}{E} \\hat{F}\n$$\nWith the wave speed $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ and wavenumber $k = \\omega/c$, this is the Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\hat{F}}{dx^2} + k^2\\hat{F} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution for force is a superposition of forward ($+x$) and backward ($-x$) propagating waves: $\\hat{F}(x) = F^+ e^{-ikx} + F^- e^{ikx}$. The corresponding velocity is found from the momentum balance equation:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(x) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\rho A} \\frac{d\\hat{F}}{dx} = \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\rho A}(-ikF^+e^{-ikx} + ikF^-e^{ikx}) = \\frac{k}{\\omega\\rho A}(F^+e^{-ikx} - F^-e^{ikx})\n$$\nSubstituting $k/\\omega = 1/c$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\rho c A} (F^+e^{-ikx} - F^-e^{ikx})\n$$\nThe characteristic impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the ratio of force to velocity for a purely forward-propagating wave ($F^-=0$):\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{F^+e^{-ikx}}{\\frac{1}{\\rho c A} F^+e^{-ikx}} = \\rho c A\n$$\nUsing $c=\\sqrt{E/\\rho}$, this can also be written as $Z_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\sqrt{E\\rho}A$.\nThis is of the form $Z_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\alpha A$ where the constant $\\alpha$ is explicitly $\\alpha = \\rho c = \\sqrt{E\\rho}$.\n\nThe inverse problem is to find the area profile $A(x)$ for a prescribed impedance profile $Z(x)$. From the derived relationship, the solution is immediate:\n$$\nA(x) = \\frac{Z(x)}{\\alpha} = \\frac{Z(x)}{\\sqrt{E\\rho}}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Reflection Coefficient at an Abrupt Step**\n\nConsider an interface at $x=0$ between two uniform bars with characteristic impedances $Z_1$ (for $x0$) and $Z_2$ (for $x>0$). At the interface, both force and particle velocity must be continuous. An incident wave ($F_i, v_i$) from the left gives rise to a reflected wave ($F_r, v_r$) and a transmitted wave ($F_t, v_t$).\nContinuity equations at $x=0$:\n$$\nF_i + F_r = F_t\n$$\n$$\nv_i + v_r = v_t\n$$\nThe force-velocity relations are: $v_i = F_i/Z_1$ for the incident wave, $v_r = -F_r/Z_1$ for the backward-reflected wave, and $v_t = F_t/Z_2$ for the forward-transmitted wave. Substituting these into the velocity continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{F_i}{Z_1} - \\frac{F_r}{Z_1} = \\frac{F_t}{Z_2}\n$$\nSubstitute $F_t$ from the force continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{Z_1}(F_i - F_r) = \\frac{1}{Z_2}(F_i + F_r)\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the reflection coefficient $\\Gamma = F_r/F_i$:\n$$\nZ_2(F_i - F_r) = Z_1(F_i + F_r) \\implies F_r(Z_1+Z_2) = F_i(Z_2-Z_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{F_r}{F_i} = \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Input Impedance of a Terminated Segment**\n\nConsider a uniform segment of length $\\ell$ and characteristic impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{c}}$, located for instance on $x \\in [-\\ell, 0]$, terminated at $x=0$ by a load impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{L}}$. The input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is sought at $x=-\\ell$.\nThe total force and velocity phasors within the segment are:\n$$\n\\hat{F}(x) = F^+ e^{-ikx} + F^- e^{ikx}\n\\qquad\n\\hat{v}(x) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\mathrm{c}}}(F^+ e^{-ikx} - F^- e^{ikx})\n$$\nAt the load ($x=0$), the impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\hat{F}(0)/\\hat{v}(0)$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{L}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{F^+ + F^-}{F^+ - F^-}\n$$\nAt the input ($x=-\\ell$), the input impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\hat{F}(-\\ell)/\\hat{v}(-\\ell)$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{F^+e^{ik\\ell} + F^-e^{-ik\\ell}}{F^+e^{ik\\ell} - F^-e^{-ik\\ell}}\n$$\nFrom the load equation, we find the reflection ratio at the load, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{L}} = F^-/F^+ = (Z_{\\mathrm{L}}-Z_{\\mathrm{c}})/(Z_{\\mathrm{L}}+Z_{\\mathrm{c}})$. Substituting this into the $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}$ expression is one path. An alternative, more direct path is to expand the terms:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{(Z_{\\mathrm{L}}+Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{ik\\ell} + (Z_{\\mathrm{L}}-Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{-ik\\ell}}{(Z_{\\mathrm{L}}+Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{ik\\ell} - (Z_{\\mathrm{L}}-Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{-ik\\ell}}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{L}}(e^{ik\\ell} + e^{-ik\\ell}) + Z_{\\mathrm{c}}(e^{ik\\ell} - e^{-ik\\ell})}{Z_{\\mathrm{L}}(e^{ik\\ell} - e^{-ik\\ell}) + Z_{\\mathrm{c}}(e^{ik\\ell} + e^{-ik\\ell})}\n$$\nUsing Euler's identities $2\\cos\\theta = e^{i\\theta}+e^{-i\\theta}$ and $2i\\sin\\theta = e^{i\\theta}-e^{-i\\theta}$, this simplifies to the standard transmission line input impedance formula:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{L}}\\cos(k\\ell) + iZ_{\\mathrm{c}}\\sin(k\\ell)}{Z_{\\mathrm{c}}\\cos(k\\ell) + iZ_{\\mathrm{L}}\\sin(k\\ell)}\n$$\nwhere $k=\\omega/c$.\n\n**Tasks 4-6: Numerical Solution for Tapered Bar**\n\nThe continuous taper of length $L$ is approximated by a cascade of $N$ uniform slices, each of length $\\Delta x = L/N$. The $j$-th slice (numbered $j=1, \\dots, N$ from left to right) has a constant characteristic impedance $Z_{c,j} = Z(x_j)$, where $x_j = (j-1/2)\\Delta x$ is the coordinate of the slice's center.\n\nThe input impedance of the entire taper, $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega)$, is computed recursively. We start at the right end of the taper ($x=L$). The taper is connected to a semi-infinite bar with area $A_{\\mathrm{R}}$, which acts as a non-reflective termination. Thus, the initial load impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{load}} = Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} = \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds from right to left. Let $Z^{(j)}$ be the input impedance at the left face of slice $j$. This impedance is the load for slice $j-1$. The input impedance for the rightmost slice $N$, which is loaded by $Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$, is calculated using the formula from Task 3 with $\\ell=\\Delta x$, $Z_{\\mathrm{c}}=Z_{c,N}$, and $Z_{\\mathrm{L}}=Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$. This process is repeated iteratively.\n\nLet $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(N)} = Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$. For $j = N, N-1, \\dots, 1$, we compute the input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j-1)}$ at the left face of slice $j$ as:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j-1)} = Z_{c,j} \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j)}\\cos(k\\Delta x) + iZ_{c,j}\\sin(k\\Delta x)}{Z_{c,j}\\cos(k\\Delta x) + iZ_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j)}\\sin(k\\Delta x)}\n$$\nAfter iterating through all slices, the final result is $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega) = Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(0)}$.\n\nThe reflection coefficient at the input of the taper ($x=0$) is then calculated from the impedance mismatch between the left semi-infinite bar (impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}$) and the taper's input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\omega) = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega) - Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega) + Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}}\n$$\nThe material properties $E = 210 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ and $\\rho = 7850 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$ yield a wave speed $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho} \\approx 5172.13\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ and impedance constant $\\alpha = \\sqrt{E\\rho} \\approx 4.0592 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{kg/(s \\cdot m^2)}$. These values are used to compute $Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} = \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} = \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n\nFor each test case, the appropriate impedance profile function $Z(x)$ is defined over $x \\in [0,L]$ with $t=x/L$:\n- **Case A (Linear):** $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} + (Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} - Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}) t$\n- **Case B (Exponential):** $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} (Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}/Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}})^{t}$\n- **Case C (Raised-Cosine):** $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} \\exp\\left( (\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\pi t)) \\log(Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}/Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}) \\right)$\n\nFor each case, the algorithm iterates over the specified frequency range, calculates $|\\Gamma(\\omega)|$ at each frequency point, and determines the maximum value.
