The quantity $C_{ijkl}$ is the fourth-order stiffness tensor. For a linear elastic material with a defined strain-energy density function, this tensor possesses the following intrinsic symmetries, irrespective of material properties:\n1.  Minor symmetries: $C_{ijkl} = C_{jikl}$ and $C_{ijkl} = C_{ijlk}$, stemming from the symmetry of the stress and strain tensors, respectively.\n2.  Major symmetry: $C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$, stemming from the existence of a strain energy potential.\n\nThese symmetries reduce the number of independent components of $C_{ijkl}$ from $3^4 = 81$ to $21$ for a general anisotropic material.\n\nMaterial symmetry imposes further constraints. A material is symmetric with respect to a transformation represented by an orthogonal matrix $Q$ if its constitutive properties are unchanged by this transformation. For the stiffness tensor, this invariance is expressed as:\n$$\nC_{pqrs} = Q_{pi} Q_{qj} Q_{rk} Q_{sl}\\, C_{ijkl}\n$$\nA cubic crystal possesses several symmetry elements, including rotations by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ ($90^\\circ$) about the coordinate axes, which are chosen to align with the crystal axes. We will use these rotations to derive the structure of $C_{ijkl}$ for a cubic material.\n\nLet us first consider a rotation by $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ about the $x_3$-axis. The transformation matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe only non-zero components are $Q_{12} = 1$, $Q_{21} = -1$, and $Q_{33} = 1$. Applying the invariance condition, we find relations between components of $C_{ijkl}$. For instance:\n$C_{1111}' = Q_{1i}Q_{1j}Q_{1k}Q_{1l} C_{ijkl} = Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{12} C_{2222} = (1)^4 C_{2222}$.\nInvariance $C_{1111}' = C_{1111}$ implies $C_{1111} = C_{2222}$. By considering a $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rotation about the $x_1$-axis, we can similarly show $C_{2222} = C_{3333}$. Thus, for cubic symmetry:\n$$\nC_{1111} = C_{2222} = C_{3333}\n$$\nApplying the same rotation to a mixed-index component:\n$C_{1133}' = Q_{1i}Q_{1j}Q_{3k}Q_{3l} C_{ijkl} = Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{33}Q_{33} C_{2233} = C_{2233}$.\nInvariance implies $C_{1133} = C_{2233}$. A rotation about the $x_1$-axis would yield $C_{2211} = C_{3311}$, which, combined with the major symmetry ($C_{1122}=C_{2211}$ etc.), leads to:\n$$\nC_{1122} = C_{1133} = C_{2233} = C_{2211} = C_{3311} = C_{3322}\n$$\nFor the shear components:\n$C_{1313}' = Q_{1i}Q_{3j}Q_{1k}Q_{3l} C_{ijkl} = Q_{12}Q_{33}Q_{12}Q_{33} C_{2323} = C_{2323}$.\nInvariance requires $C_{1313} = C_{2323}$. Cyclic permutation of axes gives:\n$$\nC_{2323} = C_{1313} = C_{1212}\n$$\nNext, we demonstrate that components coupling normal and shear effects, as well as those coupling different shear effects, must be zero. For this, we use a rotation by $\\pi$ ($180^\\circ$) about a coordinate axis, which is also a symmetry operation for a cubic crystal. Consider a rotation by $\\pi$ about the $x_1$ axis:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe effect of this transformation on a component $C_{pqrs}$ is $C_{pqrs}' = Q_{pi}Q_{qj}Q_{rk}Q_{sl}C_{ijkl}$. The sign of the transformed component depends on the number of times the indices $2$ and $3$ appear. Let $N_2$ be the count of index $2$ and $N_3$ be the count of index $3$ in the set $\\{p,q,r,s\\}$. Then $C_{pqrs}' = (-1)^{N_2+N_3} C_{pqrs}$. Invariance requires $C_{pqrs} = (-1)^{N_2+N_3} C_{pqrs}$. This can only be true if $C_{pqrs}=0$ or if $N_2+N_3$ is an even number.\nBy applying similar $\\pi$ rotations about the $x_2$ and $x_3$ axes, we find that for any component $C_{ijkl}$ to be non-zero, each index ($1$, $2$, and $3$) must appear an even number of times among the indices $\\{i, j, k, l\\}$.\n\nThis powerful constraint eliminates most components. For example:\n-   $C_{1112}$: Index $1$ appears $3$ times (odd), index $2$ appears $1$ time (odd). Thus, $C_{1112}=0$.\n-   $C_{1123}$: Index $1$ appears $2$ times (even), but index $2$ appears once (odd) and index $3$ appears once (odd). Thus, $C_{1123}=0$.\n-   $C_{1213}$: Index $1$ appears twice (even), but index $2$ appears once (odd) and index $3$ appears once (odd). Thus, $C_{1213}=0$.\n\nThe only non-zero components are of the form:\n1.  $C_{iiii}$: e.g., $C_{1111}$. Indices are ($i,i,i,i$).\n2.  $C_{iijj}$ ($i \\neq j$): e.g., $C_{1122}$. Indices are ($i,i,j,j$).\n3.  $C_{ijij}$ ($i \\neq j$): e.g., $C_{1212}$. Indices are ($i,j,i,j$).\n\nCombining these results, the stiffness tensor for a cubic material has only three independent constants:\n$C_A = C_{1111} = C_{2222} = C_{3333}$\n$C_B = C_{1122} = C_{1133} = C_{2211} = C_{2233} = C_{3311} = C_{3322}$\n$C_C = C_{2323} = C_{1313} = C_{1212}$\n\nWe now convert this to the $6 \\times 6$ Voigt matrix representation, $[\\mathbf{C}]_{\\mathrm{V}}$. The problem specifies the Voigt mapping $(11,22,33,23,13,12)\\mapsto (1,2,3,4,5,6)$, with stress vector $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{V}} = (\\sigma_{11}, \\sigma_{22}, \\sigma_{33}, \\sigma_{23}, \\sigma_{13}, \\sigma_{12})^{\\mathsf{T}}$ and engineering strain vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{V}} = (\\varepsilon_{11}, \\varepsilon_{22}, \\varepsilon_{33}, 2\\varepsilon_{23}, 2\\varepsilon_{13}, 2\\varepsilon_{12})^{\\mathsf{T}}$. The relation is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{V}} = [\\mathbf{C}]_{\\mathrm{V}}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{V}}$.\n\nLet us expand a component of the stress vector, for example $\\sigma_{1} = \\sigma_{11}$:\n$\\sigma_{11} = C_{11kl}\\varepsilon_{kl} = C_{1111}\\varepsilon_{11} + C_{1122}\\varepsilon_{22} + C_{1133}\\varepsilon_{33} + 2C_{1123}\\varepsilon_{23} + 2C_{1113}\\varepsilon_{13} + 2C_{1112}\\varepsilon_{12}$.\nIn Voigt notation, $\\varepsilon_1 = \\varepsilon_{11}$, $\\varepsilon_2 = \\varepsilon_{22}$, $\\varepsilon_3 = \\varepsilon_{33}$, and $\\varepsilon_4 = 2\\varepsilon_{23}$, $\\varepsilon_5 = 2\\varepsilon_{13}$, $\\varepsilon_6 = 2\\varepsilon_{12}$. Substituting these gives:\n$\\sigma_{1} = C_{1111}\\varepsilon_1 + C_{1122}\\varepsilon_2 + C_{1133}\\varepsilon_3 + C_{1123}\\varepsilon_4 + C_{1113}\\varepsilon_5 + C_{1112}\\varepsilon_6$.\nComparing with $\\sigma_{1} = \\sum_{J=1}^{6} C_{1J}\\varepsilon_J$, we see that $C_{1J} = C_{11kl}$ where $J$ maps to $kl$.\nA similar analysis for a shear stress component, e.g., $\\sigma_4 = \\sigma_{23}$:\n$\\sigma_{23} = C_{23kl}\\varepsilon_{kl} = C_{2311}\\varepsilon_1 + C_{2322}\\varepsilon_2 + C_{2333}\\varepsilon_3 + C_{2323}\\varepsilon_4 + C_{2313}\\varepsilon_5 + C_{2312}\\varepsilon_6$.\nThis leads to $C_{4J} = C_{23kl}$.\nThus, for this convention, the conversion is direct: $C_{IJ} = C_{ijkl}$ where $I$ and $J$ are the Voigt indices corresponding to the tensor index pairs $(ij)$ and $(kl)$.\n\nUsing the standard Voigt names for the independent constants, $C_{11} := C_{1111}$, $C_{12} := C_{1122}$, and $C_{44} := C_{2323}$, we can construct the matrix $[\\mathbf{C}]_{\\mathrm{V}}$.\n\nThe diagonal elements are:\n$C_{11} = C_{1111}$\n$C_{22} = C_{2222} = C_{1111} = C_{11}$\n$C_{33} = C_{3333} = C_{1111} = C_{11}$\n$C_{44} = C_{2323}$\n$C_{55} = C_{1313} = C_{2323} = C_{44}$\n$C_{66} = C_{1212} = C_{2323} = C_{44}$\n\nThe off-diagonal normal-normal coupling terms are:\n$C_{12} = C_{1122}$\n$C_{13} = C_{1133} = C_{1122} = C_{12}$\n$C_{23} = C_{2233} = C_{1122} = C_{12}$\nThe matrix is symmetric, so $C_{JI} = C_{IJ}$.\n\nAll coupling terms between normal and shear components ($C_{IJ}$ where $I \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, J \\in \\{4,5,6\\}$) are zero, e.g., $C_{14} = C_{1123} = 0$.\nAll coupling terms between different shear components ($C_{IJ}$ where $I, J \\in \\{4,5,6\\}, I \\neq J$) are zero, e.g., $C_{45} = C_{2313} = 0$.\n\nAssembling these components yields the final explicit matrix for a cubic material.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nC_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nC_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nC_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2918874"}, {"introduction": "With the structure of the cubic stiffness matrix established, we can now delve deeper into its physical meaning.

This matrix is diagonal. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries. Thus, there is one eigenvalue, $\\lambda_s = C_{44}$, with a geometric and algebraic multiplicity of $3$.

As suggested by the problem, we find its eigenvalues by considering physically distinct strain modes: volumetric and deviatoric. The space of normal strains, spanned by basis vectors for $\\varepsilon_{11}$, $\\varepsilon_{22}$, and $\\varepsilon_{33}$, can be decomposed into two orthogonal subspaces.\n\nThe first subspace corresponds to volumetric (hydrostatic) strain, characterized by $\\varepsilon_{11} = \\varepsilon_{22} = \\varepsilon_{33}$.

Since this is a two-dimensional subspace, this eigenvalue has a multiplicity of $2$. These are the spectral values for the deviatoric-normal strain modes.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the block $\\mathbf{A}$ are $\\lambda_1 = C_{11} + 2C_{12}$ (multiplicity $1$) and $\\lambda_2 = C_{11} - C_{12}$ (multiplicity $2$).

The only non-zero components are of the form:\n- $C_{1111} = C_{2222} = C_{3333}$\n- $C_{1122} = C_{2211} = C_{1133} = C_{3311} = C_{2233} = C_{3322}$\n- $C_{1212} = C_{2121} = C_{1313} = C_{3131} = C_{2323} = C_{3232}$\n\nIn Voigt notation, this tensor is represented as a $6 \\times 6$ matrix, $\\mathbf{C}_V$, by mapping the tensor indices $\\{11, 22, 33, 23, 13, 12\\}$ to $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The relationships are:\n- $C_{ii} = C_{iiii}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$\n- $C_{ij} = C_{iijj}$ for $i,j=1, 2, 3$ and $i \\neq j$\n- $C_{kk} = C_{ijij}$ for $k=4, 5, 6$ and $(i,j)$ being the corresponding pairs $(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)$.\n\nApplying cubic symmetry yields the three independent constants:\n- $C_{11} = C_{22} = C_{33}$\n- $C_{12} = C_{13} = C_{23}$\n- $C_{44} = C_{55} = C_{66}$\nAll other components, such as $C_{14}$, are zero. This leads to the matrix structure provided in the problem statement. From the given matrix, we identify the independent stiffness constants:\n- $C_{11} = 250$ GPa\n- $C_{12} = 150$ GPa\n- $C_{44} = 120$ GPa\n\n**Construction of the Compliance Matrix $\\mathbf{S}_V$**\nThe compliance matrix $\\mathbf{S}_V$ is the inverse of the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}_V$, i.e., $\\mathbf{S}_V = \\mathbf{C}_V^{-1}$. The stiffness matrix is block-diagonal:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_V = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{C}_{norm} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{C}_{shear} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}_{norm}$ governs the response to normal stresses and $\\mathbf{C}_{shear}$ governs the response to shear stresses.\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{norm} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{C}_{shear} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & C_{44} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse matrix $\\mathbf{S}_V$ will also be block-diagonal with $\\mathbf{S}_{norm} = \\mathbf{C}_{norm}^{-1}$ and $\\mathbf{S}_{shear} = \\mathbf{C}_{shear}^{-1}$.\n\nThe inversion of the shear block is trivial:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{shear} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/C_{44} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the compliance component $S_{44}$ (which is equal to $S_{55}$ and $S_{66}$) is:\n$$\nS_{44} = \\frac{1}{C_{44}}\n$$\n\nTo find $\\mathbf{S}_{norm}$, we must invert $\\mathbf{C}_{norm}$. The determinant of $\\mathbf{C}_{norm}$ is:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{norm}) = C_{11}(C_{11}^2 - C_{12}^2) - C_{12}(C_{11}C_{12} - C_{12}^2) + C_{12}(C_{12}^2 - C_{11}C_{12})\n$$\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{norm}) = C_{11}^3 - 3C_{11}C_{12}^2 + 2C_{12}^3 = (C_{11} + 2C_{12})(C_{11} - C_{12})^2\n$$\nThe components of the inverse matrix, $S_{ij}$, are found using the adjugate matrix.\nFor $S_{11}$:\n$$\nS_{11} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{norm})} \\begin{vmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} \\end{vmatrix} = \\frac{C_{11}^2 - C_{12}^2}{(C_{11} + 2C_{12})(C_{11} - C_{12})^2} = \\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + C_{12})}{(C_{11} + 2C_{12})(C_{11} - C_{12})^2}\n$$\n$$\nS_{11} = \\frac{C_{11}+C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}\n$$\nFor $S_{12}$:\n$$\nS_{12} = \\frac{-1}{\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{norm})} \\begin{vmatrix} C_{12} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} \\end{vmatrix} = \\frac{-(C_{11}C_{12} - C_{12}^2)}{(C_{11} + 2C_{12})(C_{11} - C_{12})^2} = \\frac{-C_{12}(C_{11} - C_{12})}{(C_{11} + 2C_{12})(C_{11} - C_{12})^2}\n$$\n$$\nS_{12} = \\frac{-C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}\n$$\n\n**Derivation and Evaluation of the Anisotropy Metric**\nFor a material to be isotropic, its elastic properties must be independent of orientation. For a cubic crystal, this imposes a further constraint on the three independent elastic constants. In terms of Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, the stiffness components for an isotropic material are $C_{11} = \\lambda + 2\\mu$, $C_{12} = \\lambda$, and $C_{44} = \\mu$. From these, we can derive the isotropy condition:\n$$\nC_{11} - C_{12} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu) - \\lambda = 2\\mu\n$$\n$$\n2C_{44} = 2\\mu\n$$\nThus, the condition for elastic isotropy in a cubic crystal is $C_{11} - C_{12} = 2C_{44}$.\n\nThe problem requires a metric that \"compares the simple shear stiffness to the tetragonal shear modulus\" and equals $1$ for an isotropic solid.\nThe simple shear stiffness, corresponding to shear on a $\\{100\\}$ plane in a $\\langle 010 \\rangle$ direction, is given by $G_{100} = C_{44}$.\nThe tetragonal shear modulus, corresponding to shear on a $\\{110\\}$ plane in a $\\langle 1\\bar{1}0 \\rangle$ direction, is given by $C' = \\frac{C_{11}-C_{12}}{2}$.\nFor an isotropic material, $C' = \\frac{2C_{44}}{2} = C_{44}$.\n\nA dimensionless anisotropy metric, often called the Zener anisotropy ratio $A$, is defined as the ratio of these two shear moduli:\n$$\nA = \\frac{G_{100}}{C'} = \\frac{C_{44}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})/2} = \\frac{2C_{44}}{C_{11}-C_{12}}\n$$\nThis metric satisfies the condition that $A=1$ for an isotropic material.\n\nWe now evaluate this metric for the given crystal using the identified stiffness constants:\n- $C_{11} = 250$ GPa\n- $C_{12} = 150$ GPa\n- $C_{44} = 120$ GPa\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n$$\nC_{11} - C_{12} = 250 - 150 = 100 \\text{ GPa}\n$$\nNext, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n2 C_{44} = 2 \\times 120 = 240 \\text{ GPa}\n$$\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$\nA = \\frac{240}{100} = 2.4\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $2.4$. To express this with $4$ significant figures, we write $2.400$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.400}$$", "id": "2918824"}]}
