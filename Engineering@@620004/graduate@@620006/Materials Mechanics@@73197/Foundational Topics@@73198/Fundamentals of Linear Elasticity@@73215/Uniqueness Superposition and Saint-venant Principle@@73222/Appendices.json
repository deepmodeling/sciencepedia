For a mechanical system, this means that the displacement must be a linear function of the applied load, i.e., $u(P) = k P$ for some constant $k$. The elastoplastic constitutive model is non-linear. The response function $u(P)$ is piecewise linear, with a change in slope at the yield point $P=P_y$:\n$$\nu(P) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{PL}{AE} & \\text{if } P \\le P_y \\\\ \\frac{P_y L}{AE} + \\frac{(P-P_y)L}{AE_T} & \\text{if } P > P_y \\end{cases}\n$$\nBecause the function $u(P)$ is not a single linear function passing through the origin, the property $u(P_1+P_2) = u(P_1) + u(P_2)$ does not hold in general. In this specific case, $u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_1)$ and $u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_2)$ are calculated on the first linear segment, while $u_{\\text{actual}}(P_1+P_2)$ is calculated on the second segment. The naive superposition $u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_1) + u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_2)$ is equivalent to calculating the displacement for the total load $P_1+P_2$ using only the initial elastic modulus $E$, thereby ignoring the change in material stiffness (the tangent modulus becomes $E_T$) after yielding. The error $\\Delta u$ quantifies this discrepancy, which arises because the state of the material (and thus its response) depends on the magnitude of the load.\n\nRegarding uniqueness, for the given problem of monotonic tensile loading of a bar made of a rate-independent, stable ($H>0$) elastoplastic material, the solution is unique. The monotonic loading path ensures that for any given final stress $\\sigma_{final} > \\sigma_y$, there is a unique corresponding total strain $\\varepsilon_{final}$ determined by the single-valued loading curve $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$. Since equilibrium dictates a uniform stress $\\sigma = P/A$ and compatibility requires a uniform strain $\\varepsilon = u/L$, a given load $P$ uniquely determines the stress, which in turn uniquely determines the strain and the final displacement. Path-dependence, a hallmark of plasticity, would become critical under non-monotonic or non-proportional loading, where the final state depends on the entire history of loading, not just the final load. However, for the simple path considered here, uniqueness is guaranteed. The use of Saint-Venant's principle is implicitly assumed in modeling the stress as uniform, which is accurate for a prismatic bar at-large, away from the localized effects of load application at $x=L$ and the fixed support at $x=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$$", "id": "2928677"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental expectation in solving physical problems is that a well-defined problem yields a single, unique solution.

The axial force resultant $N$ and the bending moment resultants about the $z$-axis ($M_z$) and $y$-axis ($M_y$) are defined as:\n$$\nN = \\int_A \\sigma_{xx} \\, dA\n$$\n$$\nM_z = \\int_A y \\sigma_{xx} \\, dA\n$$\n$$\nM_y = -\\int_A z \\sigma_{xx} \\, dA\n$$\nApplying these definitions to the far-field stress $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{out}}_{xx}$ and the applied traction $t_x$, we establish the matching conditions.\nFor the axial force:\n$$\nN = \\int_A t_x(y,z) \\, dA = \\int_A (c_0 + c_y y + c_z z) \\, dA = c_0 \\int_A dA + c_y \\int_A y \\, dA + c_z \\int_A z \\, dA\n$$\nDue to the symmetry of the circular cross-section, the integrals of $y$ and $z$ over the area are zero: $\\int_A y \\, dA = 0$ and $\\int_A z \\, dA = 0$. This simplifies the force condition to:\n$$\n\\int_A t_x \\, dA = c_0 A \\implies c_0 = \\frac{1}{A} \\int_A t_x \\, dA\n$$\nFor the bending moment about the $z$-axis:\n$$\nM_z = \\int_A y \\, t_x(y,z) \\, dA = \\int_A y(c_0 + c_y y + c_z z) \\, dA = c_0 \\int_A y \\, dA + c_y \\int_A y^2 \\, dA + c_z \\int_A yz \\, dA\n$$\nThe product moment of area $\\int_A yz \\, dA$ is also zero for a circular cross-section. The integral $\\int_A y^2 \\, dA$ defines the second moment of area $I_{zz}$. For a circle, $I_{zz} = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{4}$. The condition for $M_z$ becomes:\n$$\n\\int_A y \\, t_x \\, dA = c_y I_{zz} \\implies c_y = \\frac{1}{I_{zz}} \\int_A y \\, t_x \\, dA\n$$\nFor the bending moment about the $y$-axis:\n$$\nM_y = -\\int_A z \\, t_x(y,z) \\, dA = -\\int_A z(c_0 + c_y y + c_z z) \\, dA = -c_0 \\int_A z \\, dA - c_y \\int_A yz \\, dA - c_z \\int_A z^2 \\, dA\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_A z^2 \\, dA$ is the second moment of area $I_{yy}$. For a circle, $I_{yy} = I_{zz} = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{4}$. The condition for $M_y$ becomes:\n$$\n-\\int_A z \\, t_x \\, dA = -c_z I_{yy} \\implies c_z = \\frac{1}{I_{yy}} \\int_A z \\, t_x \\, dA\n$$\nThese three equations constitute the matching conditions that relate the outer solution coefficients to the resultants of the applied traction.\n\nWe now specialize to the given traction: $t_x(r,\\theta) = t_0 + t_1 \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)\\cos\\theta + t_2 \\left(2\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 - 1\\right)$. We compute the necessary integrals in polar coordinates where $y = r\\cos\\theta$, $z = r\\sin\\theta$, and the area element is $dA = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$. Integration is over $r \\in [0, a]$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nTo find $c_0$, we compute the total force resultant $N = \\int_A t_x \\, dA$:\n$$\nN = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a \\left[ t_0 + t_1 \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)\\cos\\theta + t_2 \\left(2\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 - 1\\right) \\right] r \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\nWe integrate term by term. The integral over $\\theta$ of $\\cos\\theta$ is zero. The second and third terms are orthogonal to the constant term over the disk.\n- Integral of $t_0$: $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a t_0 \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta = t_0 (\\pi a^2)$.\n- Integral of $t_1$ term: $\\frac{t_1}{a} (\\int_0^a r^2 dr) (\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos\\theta d\\theta) = 0$.\n- Integral of $t_2$ term: $t_2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_0^a (\\frac{2r^3}{a^2} - r) dr = 2\\pi t_2 [\\frac{2r^4}{4a^2} - \\frac{r^2}{2}]_0^a = 2\\pi t_2 (\\frac{a^2}{2} - \\frac{a^2}{2}) = 0$.\nThus, $N = t_0 \\pi a^2$. The coefficient $c_0$ is:\n$$\nc_0 = \\frac{N}{A} = \\frac{t_0 \\pi a^2}{\\pi a^2} = t_0\n$$\n\nTo find $c_y$, we compute the moment resultant $M_z = \\int_A y \\, t_x \\, dA$:\n$$\nM_z = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a (r\\cos\\theta) \\left[ t_0 + t_1 \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)\\cos\\theta + t_2 \\left(2\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 - 1\\right) \\right] r \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\nDue to orthogonality of trigonometric functions, only the term with $\\cos^2\\theta$ will yield a non-zero result.\n- Integral with $t_0$: $\\propto \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta = 0$.\n- Integral with $t_1$: $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a (r\\cos\\theta) t_1 (\\frac{r}{a}\\cos\\theta) r \\, dr \\, d\\theta = \\frac{t_1}{a} (\\int_0^a r^3 dr) (\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos^2\\theta d\\theta) = \\frac{t_1}{a} (\\frac{a^4}{4}) (\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi a^3 t_1}{4}$.\n- Integral with $t_2$: $\\propto \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta = 0$.\nThus, $M_z = \\frac{\\pi a^3 t_1}{4}$. The coefficient $c_y$ is:\n$$\nc_y = \\frac{M_z}{I_{zz}} = \\frac{\\pi a^3 t_1 / 4}{\\pi a^4 / 4} = \\frac{t_1}{a}\n$$\n\nTo find $c_z$, we compute the integral $\\int_A z \\, t_x \\, dA$:\n$$\n\\int_A z \\, t_x \\, dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a (r\\sin\\theta) \\left[ t_0 + t_1 \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)\\cos\\theta + t_2 \\left(2\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 - 1\\right) \\right] r \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\nAll terms in the integrand involve $\\sin\\theta$ or $\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta)$, which integrate to zero over $[0, 2\\pi]$. Therefore, this integral is zero.\n$$\n\\int_A z \\, t_x \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThe coefficient $c_z$ is:\n$$\nc_z = \\frac{1}{I_{yy}} \\int_A z \\, t_x \\, dA = 0\n$$\n\nThe traction component $t_2(2(r/a)^2 - 1)$ is a self-equilibrated load distribution, meaning it produces zero net force and zero net moment on the cross-section. As a consequence of Saint-Venant's principle, its effect is localized near the loaded end $x=0$ and decays away from the end, leaving no contribution to the leading-order far-field stress. Our calculation confirms this physical intuition.\n\nFinally, we assemble the far-field axial stress $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{out}}_{xx}(y,z)$ using the calculated coefficients:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\mathrm{out}}_{xx}(y,z) = c_0 + c_y y + c_z z = t_0 + \\frac{t_1}{a} y + (0)z\n$$\nThe expression for the leading-order far-field axial stress is therefore\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\mathrm{out}}_{xx}(y,z) = t_0 + \\frac{t_1 y}{a}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{t_0 + \\frac{t_1 y}{a}}\n$$", "id": "2928691"}]}
