Let the $x$-axis coincide with the undeformed neutral axis of the beam, and let $y$ be measured from the neutral axis, positive toward the top surface.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and is free of contradictions. The problem is valid. The solution proceeds by first establishing the kinematic relationship for strain under the Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis, then applying linear elasticity to find the stress, and finally integrating the stress field to verify mechanical equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we establish the axial strain field, $\\epsilon_{xx}$, as a function of the transverse coordinate $y$. The Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis states that plane cross-sections, initially normal to the beam's longitudinal axis, remain plane and normal to the deformed neutral axis after bending.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal segment of the beam of initial length $\\Delta x$ along the neutral axis. After pure bending, this segment deforms into a circular arc of length $\\Delta s_0$ with a constant radius of curvature $\\rho$. By definition of the neutral axis, its length does not change, so $\\Delta s_0 = \\Delta x$. If this arc subtends an angle $\\Delta \\theta$, then $\\Delta x = \\rho \\Delta \\theta$. The curvature $\\kappa$ is defined as the reciprocal of the radius of curvature, $\\kappa = 1/\\rho$. Therefore, $\\Delta x = (1/\\kappa) \\Delta \\theta$.\n\nNow consider a fiber located at a distance $y$ from the neutral axis. Its initial length is also $\\Delta x$. After bending, this fiber becomes a concentric circular arc of radius $(\\rho - y)$ subtending the same angle $\\Delta \\theta$. Its new length, $\\Delta s$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta s = (\\rho - y) \\Delta \\theta $$\nThe sign convention here implies that for a positive curvature $\\kappa > 0$ (so $\\rho > 0$), the center of curvature is located in the negative $y$ direction. Fibers with $y>0$ are on the inner side of the curve.\n\nThe normal strain in the $x$-direction, $\\epsilon_{xx}$, is the change in length per unit original length:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx}(y) = \\frac{\\Delta s - \\Delta x}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{(\\rho - y)\\Delta\\theta - \\rho\\Delta\\theta}{\\rho\\Delta\\theta} = \\frac{-y \\Delta\\theta}{\\rho\\Delta\\theta} = -\\frac{y}{\\rho} $$\nSubstituting $\\kappa = 1/\\rho$, we obtain the axial strain field as a function of $y$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx}(y) = -\\kappa y $$\nThis result shows that the strain varies linearly across the thickness of the beam, being zero at the neutral axis ($y=0$).\n\nNext, we evaluate the strains at the top and bottom fibers of the rectangular cross-section. The top fiber is at $y = +h/2$ and the bottom fiber is at $y = -h/2$.\nThe strain at the top fiber is:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx}(y=+h/2) = -\\kappa \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\kappa h}{2} $$\nThis is a compressive strain, as indicated by the negative sign.\nThe strain at the bottom fiber is:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx}(y=-h/2) = -\\kappa \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\kappa h}{2} $$\nThis is a tensile strain, consistent with the sign convention that tension is positive.\n\nWith the strain field established, we use the given linear elastic constitutive law, $\\sigma_{xx} = E \\epsilon_{xx}$, to determine the axial normal stress field $\\sigma_{xx}(y)$. Here, $E$ is the Young's modulus.\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(y) = E \\epsilon_{xx}(y) = E(-\\kappa y) = -E \\kappa y $$\nThis equation shows that the normal stress also varies linearly with the distance $y$ from the neutral axis. This is the expression requested for the final answer.\n\nFinally, we must verify that this stress distribution satisfies the conditions of equilibrium for pure bending.\nFirst, the resultant axial force $N$ over the cross-sectional area $A$ must be zero. The area element is $\\mathrm{d}A = b \\, \\mathrm{d}y$, where $b$ is the width of the beam.\n$$ N = \\int_{A} \\sigma_{xx} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{-h/2}^{+h/2} (-E \\kappa y) b \\, \\mathrm{d}y $$\nSince $E$, $\\kappa$, and $b$ are constants, we can factor them out of the integral:\n$$ N = -E \\kappa b \\int_{-h/2}^{+h/2} y \\, \\mathrm{d}y $$\nThe integral of an odd function ($y^1$) over a symmetric interval is zero. We can show this explicitly:\n$$ \\int_{-h/2}^{+h/2} y \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\left[ \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right]_{-h/2}^{+h/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - \\frac{h^2}{4} \\right) = 0 $$\nThus, the axial force resultant is $N=0$. This confirms that the net force on any cross-section is zero, and that our initial assumption of the neutral axis coinciding with the geometric centroid (where $\\int_A y \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0$) is correct for a symmetric section under pure bending.\n\nSecond, the resultant bending moment $M_z$ about the $z$-axis is calculated. The standard sign convention defines a positive moment as one that induces tension in the positive $y$ direction. However, our kinematics have compression for positive $y$. To be consistent, the moment integral is $M_z = \\int_A (-y) \\sigma_{xx} dA$.\n$$ M_z = \\int_{A} (-y)(-E \\kappa y) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = E \\kappa \\int_{A} y^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\nThe integral $\\int_{A} y^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A$ is the second moment of area (or area moment of inertia) of the cross-section about the $z$-axis, denoted as $I_{zz}$ or simply $I$. For a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and height $h$, this integral is:\n$$ I = \\int_{-h/2}^{+h/2} y^2 (b \\, \\mathrm{d}y) = b \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{+h/2} = \\frac{b}{3} \\left( \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^3 \\right) = \\frac{b}{3} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{8} + \\frac{h^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{b}{3} \\left( \\frac{2h^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{bh^3}{12} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the moment, we get:\n$$ M_z = E \\kappa I = E \\kappa \\frac{bh^3}{12} $$\nThis expression, $M_z = EI\\kappa$, is the moment-curvature relationship, consistent with the main article.

It shall be solved in two parts as requested.\n\nThe first task is a derivation of the parallel axis theorem for a composite area. The second task is a direct application of this theorem to a specific engineering cross-section.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Formula for the Second Moment of Area of a Composite Section**\n\nWe begin from first principles, specifically the provided definition for the second moment of area, $I$, about a reference axis:\n$$I = \\int_{A} y^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A$$\nThe objective is to determine the second moment of area of a composite body, which is composed of $n$ non-overlapping subareas $\\{A_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, about the composite centroidal axis. Let this target axis be denoted by $y = \\bar{y}$, where $\\bar{y}$ is the coordinate of the composite centroid.\n\nThe second moment of area of the entire cross-section $A$ about its own centroidal axis, which we will denote as $I_{\\bar{y}}$, is given by the definition, where the distance is measured from this centroidal axis:\n$$I_{\\bar{y}} = \\int_{A} (y - \\bar{y})^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A$$\nSince the total area $A$ is the union of the subareas $A_i$, the integral can be expressed as a summation over these subareas:\n$$I_{\\bar{y}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\int_{A_{i}} (y - \\bar{y})^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A$$\nFor each subarea $A_i$, we introduce its own centroidal coordinate, $y_{i}^{c}$. We can express the coordinate $y$ within subarea $A_i$ as $y = y_{i}^{c} + (y - y_{i}^{c})$. Let $y'_i = y - y_{i}^{c}$ be the local coordinate within subarea $A_i$ relative to its own centroid. Substituting this into the integral for the $i$-th subarea:\n$$\\int_{A_{i}} (y - \\bar{y})^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{A_{i}} ((y - y_{i}^{c}) + (y_{i}^{c} - \\bar{y}))^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A$$\nLet the distance between the centroid of subarea $i$ and the composite centroid be $d_i = y_{i}^{c} - \\bar{y}$.

The first term, $\\int_{A_{i}} (y - y_{i}^{c})^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A$, is, by definition, the second moment of area of subarea $A_i$ about its own centroidal axis. This is given in the problem statement as $I_{i}^{c}$.\n$2$. The second term involves the integral $\\int_{A_{i}} (y - y_{i}^{c})\\,\\mathrm{d}A$.

The third term is $d_i^2 \\int_{A_{i}}\\,\\mathrm{d}A = d_i^2 A_i$, where $A_i$ is the area of the $i$-th subregion.\n\nCombining these results, the contribution of subarea $A_i$ to the total second moment of area is:\n$$ I_{i}^{c} + 0 + d_i^2 A_i = I_{i}^{c} + A_i d_i^2 $$\nSubstituting $d_i = y_{i}^{c} - \\bar{y}$, this becomes $I_{i}^{c} + A_i(y_{i}^{c} - \\bar{y})^2$.\n\nTo find the total second moment of area $I_{\\bar{y}}$, we sum the contributions from all $n$ subareas:\n$$I_{\\bar{y}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[I_{i}^{c} + A_i(y_{i}^{c} - \\bar{y})^{2}\\right]$$\nThis is the required formula. It represents the parallel axis theorem for a composite area, expressing the total second moment of area about the composite centroidal axis as the sum of two parts for each subarea: its own centroidal second moment of area, and a transfer term $A_i d_i^2$ that accounts for the translation of the axis from its local centroid to the global centroid.\n\n**Task 2: Application to a Built-up I-Section**\n\nWe apply the derived formula to calculate the second moment of area $I_x$ of the specified I-section about its horizontal centroidal axis.\n\nFirst, establish a coordinate system. Due to the specified symmetry, the composite centroidal axis (the neutral axis for bending) lies at the mid-depth of the section. We place the origin $(0,0)$ at this composite centroid. The axis for which we calculate the second moment of area is the $x$-axis (so that $y=0$ corresponds to the neutral axis).\n\nThe cross-section is composed of three rectangular components: a top flange (component $1$), a web (component $2$), and a bottom flange (component $3$). For a rectangle with base $b$ and height $h$, its area is $A=bh$ and its second moment of area about its centroidal axis parallel to the base is $I^c = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$.\n\nWe calculate the necessary properties for each component:\nComponent 1 (Top Flange):\n- Dimensions: base $b_1 = b_f = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}$, height $h_1 = t_f = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Area: $A_1 = b_f t_f = (0.25\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.00625\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n- Centroidal second moment of area: $I_1^c = \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{12} = \\frac{(0.25\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.025\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{12}$.\n- Centroid location $y_1^c$: The centroid is located at a distance of half the web height plus half the flange thickness above the origin.\n  $y_1^c = \\frac{h_w}{2} + \\frac{t_f}{2} = \\frac{0.45\\,\\mathrm{m}}{2} + \\frac{0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}}{2} = 0.225\\,\\mathrm{m} + 0.0125\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.2375\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nComponent 2 (Web):\n- Dimensions: base $b_2 = t_w = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{m}$, height $h_2 = h_w = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Area: $A_2 = t_w h_w = (0.012\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.45\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.0054\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n- Centroidal second moment of area: $I_2^c = \\frac{t_w h_w^3}{12} = \\frac{(0.012\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.45\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{12}$.\n- Centroid location $y_2^c$: The web is centered at the mid-depth, so its centroid coincides with the composite centroid. Thus, $y_2^c = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nComponent 3 (Bottom Flange):\n- By symmetry with the top flange, its properties are identical except for the sign of the centroid location.\n- Area: $A_3 = A_1 = 0.00625\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n- Centroidal second moment of area: $I_3^c = I_1^c = \\frac{(0.25\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.025\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{12}$.\n- Centroid location: $y_3^c = -y_1^c = -0.2375\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe composite centroid is at $\\bar{y}=0$. The formula from Task 1 becomes:\n$$I_x = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[I_{i}^{c} + A_i(y_{i}^{c} - 0)^{2}\\right] = (I_1^c + A_1(y_1^c)^2) + (I_2^c + A_2(y_2^c)^2) + (I_3^c + A_3(y_3^c)^2)$$\nDue to symmetry, the terms for the top and bottom flanges are identical, since $(y_3^c)^2 = (-y_1^c)^2 = (y_1^c)^2$. The transfer distance for the web is zero. The calculation simplifies to:\n$$I_x = 2(I_1^c + A_1(y_1^c)^2) + I_2^c$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values:\n$$I_x = 2\\left[\\frac{(0.25)(0.025)^3}{12} + (0.00625)(0.2375)^2\\right] + \\frac{(0.012)(0.45)^3}{12}$$\nCalculate the individual terms:\n- Flange centroidal contribution: $2 \\times I_1^c = 2 \\times \\frac{(0.25)(0.000015625)}{12} \\approx 6.5104 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^4$.\n- Flange transfer contribution: $2 \\times A_1(y_1^c)^2 = 2 \\times (0.00625)(0.05640625) = 7.05078125 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^4$.\n- Web centroidal contribution: $I_2^c = \\frac{(0.012)(0.091125)}{12} = 9.1125 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^4$.\n\nSumming these contributions:\n$$I_x = (6.5104 \\times 10^{-7}) + (7.05078125 \\times 10^{-4}) + (9.1125 \\times 10^{-5})$$\n$$I_x = 0.00000065104 + 0.000705078125 + 0.000091125$$\n$$I_x = 0.00079685416... \\,\\mathrm{m}^4$$\nIn scientific notation, this is $7.9685416... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^4$.

The result for this loading case is:\n$$ w_{s}(L/2) = -\\frac{qL^2}{8kAG} $$\nThe total midspan deflection under Timoshenko theory is the sum of these two components:\n$$ w_{\\mathrm{T}}(L/2) = w_b(L/2) + w_s(L/2) = -\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI} - \\frac{qL^2}{8kAG} $$\n\n**Euler-Bernoulli Deflection:**\nThe Euler-Bernoulli theory neglects shear deformation, so its prediction is simply the bending component:\n$$ w_{\\mathrm{EB}}(L/2) = -\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI} $$\n\n**Ratio Calculation:**\nThe problem defines the ratio $R$ based on the magnitudes of the deflections:\n$$ R = \\frac{|w_{\\mathrm{T}}(L/2)|}{|w_{\\mathrm{EB}}(L/2)|} = \\frac{\\left|-\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI} - \\frac{qL^2}{8kAG}\\right|}{\\left|-\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI}\\right|} = \\frac{\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI} + \\frac{qL^2}{8kAG}}{\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI}} $$\n$$ R = 1 + \\frac{qL^2}{8kAG} \\cdot \\frac{384EI}{5qL^4} = 1 + \\frac{384}{40} \\frac{EI}{kAGL^2} = 1 + 9.6 \\frac{EI}{kAGL^2} $$\nNow, substitute the given expressions for $I$, $A$, and $G$:\n$I = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$, $A = bh$, $G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$.\n$$ R = 1 + 9.6 \\frac{E \\left(\\frac{bh^3}{12}\\right)}{k(bh) \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} L^2} $$\nCanceling common terms ($E$, $b$, $h$):\n$$ R = 1 + 9.6 \\frac{\\frac{h^2}{12}}{k \\frac{1}{2(1+\\nu)} L^2} = 1 + \\frac{9.6 \\cdot 2(1+\\nu)}{12k} \\left(\\frac{h}{L}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ R = 1 + 1.6 \\frac{1+\\nu}{k} \\left(\\frac{h}{L}\\right)^2 $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation:**\nSubstitute the given values: $k = 5/6$, $L/h = 10$ (so $h/L = 1/10$), and $\\nu = 0.30$.\n$$ R = 1 + 1.6 \\frac{1+0.30}{5/6} \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ R = 1 + 1.6 \\frac{1.3}{5/6} \\left(\\frac{1}{100}\\right) $$\n$$ R = 1 + 1.6 \\cdot 1.3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5} \\cdot 0.01 $$\n$$ R = 1 + (2.08) \\cdot (1.2) \\cdot 0.01 $$\n$$ R = 1 + (2.496) \\cdot 0.01 $$\n$$ R = 1 + 0.02496 = 1.02496 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.025$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.025}$$", "id": "2867793"}]}
