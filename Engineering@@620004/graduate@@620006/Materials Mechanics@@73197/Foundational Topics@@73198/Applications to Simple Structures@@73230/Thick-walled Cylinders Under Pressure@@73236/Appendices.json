The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is formally stated, and free of ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the exact hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}(a)$.\nWe begin with the fundamental equations. The condition of a \"long\" cylinder implies a state of plane strain, where the axial strain $\\varepsilon_z$ is constant. For a cylinder with free ends (or by superposition arguments for a capped cylinder), it is typical to assume $\\varepsilon_z=0$ or, more generally, constant. The in-plane solution for stresses is independent of this specific axial constraint.\n\nWe use the strain compatibility equation for an axisymmetric problem, which is derived from the given strain-displacement relations:\nFrom $\\varepsilon_{\\theta}=u/r$, we have $u = r\\varepsilon_{\\theta}$. Differentiating with respect to $r$ yields $\\frac{du}{dr} = \\varepsilon_{\\theta} + r\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\theta}}{dr}$. Since $\\varepsilon_r = du/dr$, we obtain the compatibility relation:\n$$ \\varepsilon_r = \\varepsilon_\\theta + r\\frac{d\\varepsilon_\\theta}{dr} \\implies \\frac{d\\varepsilon_\\theta}{dr} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_\\theta - \\varepsilon_r}{r} = 0 $$\nFor a linearly elastic, isotropic material under plane strain ($\\varepsilon_z=0$), Hooke's Law gives the strains in terms of stresses:\n$$ \\varepsilon_r = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\left[ (1-\\nu)\\sigma_r - \\nu \\sigma_\\theta \\right] $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_\\theta = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\left[ (1-\\nu)\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu \\sigma_r \\right] $$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. Substituting these into the compatibility equation, the constant factor $\\frac{1+\\nu}{E}$ cancels, leaving an equation in terms of stresses:\n$$ r \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[(1-\\nu)\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu \\sigma_r\\right] + \\left[(1-\\nu)\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu \\sigma_r\\right] - \\left[(1-\\nu)\\sigma_r - \\nu \\sigma_\\theta\\right] = 0 $$\n$$ r(1-\\nu)\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} - r\\nu\\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\sigma_\\theta - \\sigma_r = 0 $$\nFrom the given equilibrium equation, $\\sigma_\\theta - \\sigma_r = r \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr}$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$ r(1-\\nu)\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} - r\\nu\\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + r\\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} = 0 $$\n$$ r(1-\\nu)\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} + r(1-\\nu)\\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} = 0 $$\nFor $r \\neq 0$ and $\\nu \\neq 1$, this simplifies to $\\frac{d}{dr}(\\sigma_r + \\sigma_\\theta) = 0$. This implies that the sum of the principal stresses is constant:\n$$ \\sigma_r + \\sigma_\\theta = 2A $$\nwhere $2A$ is a constant of integration. We can now express $\\sigma_\\theta$ as $\\sigma_\\theta = 2A - \\sigma_r$ and substitute it into the equilibrium equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - (2A - \\sigma_r)}{r} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{2\\sigma_r}{r} - \\frac{2A}{r} = 0 $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, which can be written as $\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2\\sigma_r) = \\frac{2A}{r}$. Rearranging gives $\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2\\sigma_r) = 2Ar$. Integrating with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ r^2\\sigma_r = Ar^2 - B $$\nwhere $-B$ is another integration constant. This leads to the general solutions for stresses, known as the Lamé equations:\n$$ \\sigma_r(r) = A - \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = 2A - \\sigma_r(r) = 2A - \\left(A - \\frac{B}{r^2}\\right) = A + \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined from the boundary conditions:\n1. At the inner surface, $r=a$: $\\sigma_r(a) = -p \\implies A - \\frac{B}{a^2} = -p$.\n2. At the outer surface, $r=b$: $\\sigma_r(b) = 0 \\implies A - \\frac{B}{b^2} = 0$, which gives $A = \\frac{B}{b^2}$.\n\nSubstituting $A$ into the first boundary condition equation:\n$$ \\frac{B}{b^2} - \\frac{B}{a^2} = -p \\implies B\\left(\\frac{1}{b^2} - \\frac{1}{a^2}\\right) = -p $$\n$$ B\\left(\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2 b^2}\\right) = -p \\implies B = \\frac{p a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\nThen, the constant $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{b^2} \\left(\\frac{p a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2}\\right) = \\frac{p a^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\nWith constants $A$ and $B$ determined, the hoop stress at any radius $r$ is known. We require the hoop stress at the inner surface, $r=a$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(a) = A + \\frac{B}{a^2} = \\frac{p a^2}{b^2 - a^2} + \\frac{1}{a^2}\\left(\\frac{p a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2}\\right) = \\frac{p a^2 + p b^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(a) = p \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2-a^2} $$\nThis is the required exact expression for the inner-surface hoop stress.\n\nPart 2: Relative Error $E$ as a function of $k=b/a$.\nThe thin-wall approximation for hoop stress is given as $\\sigma_{\\theta}^{\\mathrm{tw}} = p\\,r_{m}/t$. Using the provided definitions $r_m = (a+b)/2$ and $t=b-a$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^{\\mathrm{tw}} = p \\frac{(a+b)/2}{b-a} = p \\frac{a+b}{2(b-a)} $$\nThe relative error $E$ is defined as $E = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}^{\\mathrm{tw}}-\\sigma_{\\theta}(a)}{\\sigma_{\\theta}(a)} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}^{\\mathrm{tw}}}{\\sigma_{\\theta}(a)} - 1$.\nWe compute the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}^{\\mathrm{tw}}}{\\sigma_{\\theta}(a)} = \\frac{p \\frac{a+b}{2(b-a)}}{p \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2-a^2}} = \\frac{a+b}{2(b-a)} \\cdot \\frac{b^2-a^2}{a^2+b^2} = \\frac{a+b}{2(b-a)} \\cdot \\frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{a^2+b^2} = \\frac{(a+b)^2}{2(a^2+b^2)} $$\nNow, we find the error $E$:\n$$ E = \\frac{(a+b)^2}{2(a^2+b^2)} - 1 = \\frac{a^2+2ab+b^2 - 2(a^2+b^2)}{2(a^2+b^2)} = \\frac{-a^2+2ab-b^2}{2(a^2+b^2)} = -\\frac{(a-b)^2}{2(a^2+b^2)} $$\nTo express $E$ as a function of $k=b/a$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $a^2$:\n$$ E(k) = -\\frac{(a-b)^2/a^2}{2(a^2+b^2)/a^2} = -\\frac{(1-b/a)^2}{2(1+(b/a)^2)} = -\\frac{(1-k)^2}{2(1+k^2)} = -\\frac{(k-1)^2}{2(k^2+1)} $$\nThe error is always negative for $k>1$, indicating that the thin-wall approximation underestimates the maximum (inner-surface) hoop stress.\n\nPart 3: Determine the threshold ratio $k$ for a given error tolerance.\nWe are asked to find the smallest $k>1$ for which the magnitude of the relative error $|E(k)|$ equals a tolerance $\\tau=0.1$.\n$$ |E(k)| = \\left| -\\frac{(k-1)^2}{2(k^2+1)} \\right| = \\frac{(k-1)^2}{2(k^2+1)} $$\nSetting this equal to $\\tau=0.1$:\n$$ \\frac{(k-1)^2}{2(k^2+1)} = 0.1 $$\n$$ (k-1)^2 = 0.2(k^2+1) $$\n$$ k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0.2k^2 + 0.2 $$\n$$ (1-0.2)k^2 - 2k + (1-0.2) = 0 $$\n$$ 0.8k^2 - 2k + 0.8 = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $5$ to clear the decimals gives:\n$$ 4k^2 - 10k + 4 = 0 $$\nDividing by $2$ gives a simpler quadratic equation:\n$$ 2k^2 - 5k + 2 = 0 $$\nWe solve for $k$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nk = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(2)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25-16}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}\n$$\nThis yields two possible solutions:\n$$ k_1 = \\frac{5+3}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 $$\n$$ k_2 = \\frac{5-3}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5 $$\nThe problem requires the ratio $k = b/a > 1$, as the outer radius must be larger than the inner radius.

The problem setup is self-consistent and poses no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem in advanced mechanics of materials. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the hoop stresses at the bore ($r=a$) under various conditions and ultimately find the difference in residual hoop stress predictions between the Tresca and von Mises yield criteria.\n\nFor a cylinder under internal pressure, the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is tensile and the radial stress $\\sigma_{r}$ is compressive. For the specified plane stress condition ($\\sigma_{z}=0$), the principal stresses at any point are ordered as $\\sigma_{1} = \\sigma_{\\theta}$, $\\sigma_{2} = \\sigma_{z} = 0$, and $\\sigma_{3} = \\sigma_{r}$, provided $\\sigma_{\\theta} > 0$ and $\\sigma_{r}  0$.\n\n**1. Hoop Stress at the Bore at Maximum Pressure $p_{\\max}$**\n\nAt the bore $r=a$, the cylinder is in a state of plastic flow under the maximum pressure $p_{\\max}=480\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The state of stress must satisfy both the boundary condition $\\sigma_{r}(a) = -p_{\\max}$ and the operative yield criterion.\n\n*   **Tresca Yield Criterion:**\n    The Tresca criterion states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches the shear yield stress, $\\tau_{\\max} = \\sigma_{y}/2$. For the given principal stress ordering, $\\tau_{\\max} = (\\sigma_{1}-\\sigma_{3})/2$.\n    The yield condition is therefore:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta} - \\sigma_{r} = \\sigma_{y} $$\n    At the bore, we enforce this condition along with $\\sigma_{r}(a) = -p_{\\max}$.\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Tresca}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) - (-p_{\\max}) = \\sigma_{y} $$\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Tresca}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) = \\sigma_{y} - p_{\\max} $$\n    Substituting the numerical values:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Tresca}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) = 600\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 480\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\n*   **von Mises Yield Criterion:**\n    The von Mises yield criterion for plane stress ($\\sigma_{z}=0$) is:\n    $$ \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\theta}^2 - \\sigma_{\\theta}\\sigma_{r} + \\sigma_{r}^2} = \\sigma_{y} $$\n    Again, we apply this condition at the bore $r=a$ with $\\sigma_{r}(a)=-p_{\\max}$:\n    $$ \\sqrt{\\left(\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a)\\right)^2 - \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a)(-p_{\\max}) + (-p_{\\max})^2} = \\sigma_{y} $$\n    Squaring both sides gives a quadratic equation for $\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a)$:\n    $$ \\left(\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a)\\right)^2 + p_{\\max}\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) + (p_{\\max}^2 - \\sigma_{y}^2) = 0 $$\n    Solving for $\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a)$ yields:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) = \\frac{-p_{\\max} \\pm \\sqrt{p_{\\max}^2 - 4(p_{\\max}^2 - \\sigma_{y}^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-p_{\\max} \\pm \\sqrt{4\\sigma_{y}^2 - 3p_{\\max}^2}}{2} $$\n    Since the hoop stress must be tensile, we select the positive root.\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-p_{\\max} + \\sqrt{4\\sigma_{y}^2 - 3p_{\\max}^2}\\right) $$\n    Substituting numerical values:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-480 + \\sqrt{4(600)^2 - 3(480)^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-480 + \\sqrt{1440000 - 691200}\\right) $$\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-480 + \\sqrt{748800}\\right) = -240 + \\sqrt{187200} = -240 + 120\\sqrt{13} \\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n    Numerically, this is approximately $192.6662\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\n**2. Elastic Hoop Stress at the Bore**\n\nIf the cylinder had behaved elastically up to $p_{\\max}$, the stresses would be given by the Lamé equations. The hoop stress at any radius $r$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(r) = \\frac{p_{\\max} a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2}\\right) $$\nAt the bore, $r=a$, this becomes:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a) = \\frac{p_{\\max} a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}\\right) = p_{\\max} \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\nSubstituting the given values $a=40\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $b=120\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $p_{\\max}=480\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a) = (480\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\frac{(120)^2 + (40)^2}{(120)^2 - (40)^2} = (480\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\frac{14400 + 1600}{14400 - 1600} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a) = (480\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\frac{16000}{12800} = (480\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\times 1.25 = 600\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\n**3. Residual Hoop Stress at the Bore**\n\nThe process of unloading from $p_{\\max}$ is assumed to be purely elastic. The residual stress state is found by superposing the stress state at maximum load (from Part 1) with the elastic stress state corresponding to unloading (which is the negative of the elastic loading state from Part 2).\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{res}}(a) = \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) - \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a) $$\n\n*   **Tresca Yield Criterion:**\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{res}}^{(\\mathrm{Tresca})}(a) = \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Tresca}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) - \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a) = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 600\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = -480\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\n*   **von Mises Yield Criterion:**\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{res}}^{(\\mathrm{Mises})}(a) = \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) - \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a) = (-240 + 120\\sqrt{13})\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 600\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{res}}^{(\\mathrm{Mises})}(a) = (-840 + 120\\sqrt{13})\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx -407.3338\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe negative signs indicate compressive residual stress at the bore, as expected.\n\n**4. Sensitivity of Residual Stress to Yield Criterion**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta \\equiv \\sigma_{\\theta,\\mathrm{res}}^{(\\mathrm{Mises})}(a)-\\sigma_{\\theta,\\mathrm{res}}^{(\\mathrm{Tresca})}(a) $$\nUsing the superposition principle, this difference simplifies:\n$$ \\Delta = \\left(\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) - \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a)\\right) - \\left(\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Tresca}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) - \\sigma_{\\theta}^{(\\mathrm{el})}(a)\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Mises}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) - \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{Tresca}}^{(\\mathrm{load})}(a) $$\nSubstituting the results from Part 1:\n$$ \\Delta = (-240 + 120\\sqrt{13})\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = (-360 + 120\\sqrt{13})\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ \\Delta \\approx (192.6662 - 120)\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 72.6662\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final result is $72.67\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{72.67}\n$$", "id": "2925569"}]}
