Since both members are made of the same material, $G$ is identical for both. Therefore, to compare their torsional stiffness, we must compare their respective polar second moments of area, $J$.\n\nThe polar second moment of area, $J$, is defined by the integral over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$J = \\iint_A \\rho^2 \\,dA$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the radial distance from the centroidal axis of torsion. This definition highlights that area elements located farther from the centroid contribute more significantly to $J$, with a dependence on the square of the distance.\n\nLet us compute $J$ for each member.\n\n**Member 1: Solid Circular Bar**\nThe cross-section is a solid circle of radius $R_s$.

The problem gives the approximation $A_t \\approx 2\\pi R t$ based on the thin-wall assumption $t \\ll R$.\nWe can calculate $J_{\\text{tube}}$ by treating the entire area as being concentrated at the mean radius $R$, as the variation in $\\rho^2$ across the small thickness $t$ is negligible.\n$$J_{\\text{tube}} = \\iint_{A_t} \\rho^2 \\,dA \\approx R^2 \\iint_{A_t} dA = R^2 A_t$$\nSubstituting the expression for the area $A_t$:\n$$J_{\\text{tube}} \\approx R^2 (2\\pi R t) = 2\\pi R^3 t$$\n\n**Comparison under the Equal-Area Constraint**\nThe problem imposes the constraint $A_s = A_t$.\n$$\\pi R_s^2 = 2\\pi R t$$\nThis gives a relationship between the geometric parameters of the two members:\n$$R_s^2 = 2 R t$$\n\nNow, we will find the ratio of the polar second moments of area, $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}}$.\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{tube}}}{J_{\\text{solid}}} = \\frac{2\\pi R^3 t}{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi R_s^4} = \\frac{4 R^3 t}{R_s^4}$$\nUsing the constraint $R_s^2 = 2 R t$, we can substitute for $t = R_s^2 / (2R)$:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{tube}}}{J_{\\text{solid}}} = \\frac{4 R^3 \\left( \\frac{R_s^2}{2R} \\right)}{R_s^4} = \\frac{2 R^2 R_s^2}{R_s^4} = 2 \\frac{R^2}{R_s^2} = 2 \\left( \\frac{R}{R_s} \\right)^2$$\nThis ratio determines which member is torsionally stiffer. A ratio greater than $1$ means the tube is stiffer, while a ratio less than $1$ means the solid bar is stiffer.\n\nThe condition for the tube to be stiffer is $J_{\\text{tube}} > J_{\\text{solid}}$, which implies:\n$$2 \\left( \\frac{R}{R_s} \\right)^2 > 1 \\implies \\left( \\frac{R}{R_s} \\right)^2 > \\frac{1}{2} \\implies R > \\frac{R_s}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the tube is thin-walled, i.e., $t \\ll R$, or $t/R \\ll 1$. Let us examine what this condition implies for the ratio $R/R_s$. From the equal-area constraint, $t = R_s^2 / (2R)$.\n$$\\frac{t}{R} = \\frac{R_s^2 / (2R)}{R} = \\frac{R_s^2}{2R^2} \\ll 1$$\nThis means $2R^2 \\gg R_s^2$, or $R^2 \\gg R_s^2 / 2$. This condition is a much stronger requirement than $R^2 > R_s^2 / 2$. Therefore, for any cross-section that can be legitimately described as a \"thin-walled tube\" under the equal-area constraint, it is necessarily true that $R > R_s/\\sqrt{2}$, and in fact $R$ must be significantly larger. Consequently, a thin-walled tube with the same cross-sectional area as a solid bar is always torsionally stiffer.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the provided options.\n\n**A. The solid bar is always torsionally stiffer for equal area because the material is contiguous across the section; removing the core (to form a tube) reduces $J$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed because the problem is not about removing material from a given bar but about comparing two different bars with equal area. By distributing the same amount of material at a larger radius, the polar second moment of area increases, as evidenced by the $\\rho^2$ term in its definition. Our derivation shows that for a thin-walled tube, $J_{\\text{tube}} > J_{\\text{solid}}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. For equal area, a thin-walled circular tube is always stiffer than the solid bar regardless of its mean radius $R$, and the ratio $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}}$ is independent of $R$.**\nThe first part of the statement, that the tube is always stiffer, is correct. However, the second part is false. The ratio of stiffnesses is $2(R/R_s)^2$, which is explicitly dependent on the mean radius $R$ of the tube. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For equal area, the torsional stiffnesses are equal because $J$ depends only on total area and not on its radial distribution.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The polar second moment of area, $J = \\iint \\rho^2 \\,dA$, is by definition a measure of how the area is distributed relative to the axis. Material located farther from the centroidal axis contributes disproportionately more to stiffness. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Under the equal-area constraint, a thin-walled circular tube of mean radius $R$ and thickness $t$ satisfies $A_t \\approx 2\\pi R t = \\pi R_s^2$, and the resulting polar second moment satisfies $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}} = 2\\,(R/R_s)^2$. Hence $J_{\\text{tube}} > J_{\\text{solid}}$ whenever $R > R_s/\\sqrt{2}$; in particular, any truly thin-walled tube (with $t/R \\ll 1$) is stiffer.**\nThis statement meticulously follows the correct derivation. It correctly states the equal-area constraint: $2\\pi R t = \\pi R_s^2$. It correctly states the ratio of the polar second moments of area: $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}} = 2(R/R_s)^2$. It correctly deduces the condition for the tube to be stiffer: $R > R_s/\\sqrt{2}$. Finally, it correctly connects this to the thin-wall assumption ($t/R \\ll 1$), showing that this assumption guarantees the condition for greater stiffness is met. The entire statement is a logically sound and complete summary of the analysis. **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2926971"}, {"introduction": "While the analysis of uniform shafts is straightforward, many real-world components feature varying cross-sections to save weight or accommodate connections.

Second, we use Castigliano's second theorem to determine the unknown reaction torques.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Total Strain Energy**\n\nThe strain energy density, $u$, which is the strain energy per unit volume for a linear elastic material in pure shear, is given by\n$$u = \\frac{\\tau^2}{2G}$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the shear stress and $G$ is the shear modulus of the material.\n\nIn a circular shaft of polar moment of inertia $J$ subjected to a torque $T$, the shear stress $\\tau$ at a radial distance $\\rho$ from the central axis is given by the torsion formula:\n$$\\tau(\\rho) = \\frac{T\\rho}{J}$$\n\nTo find the total strain energy $U$ in a prismatic segment of the shaft of length $L$, we must integrate the strain energy density $u$ over the volume $V$ of the segment.\n$$U_{segment} = \\int_V u \\,dV = \\int_0^L \\left( \\int_A \\frac{\\tau(\\rho)^2}{2G} \\,dA \\right) dx$$\nwhere $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $x$ is the coordinate along the shaft's axis.

We can rewrite the integral as:\n$$U_{segment} = \\int_0^L \\frac{T^2}{2GJ^2} \\left( \\int_A \\rho^2 \\,dA \\right) dx$$\nThe integral $\\int_A \\rho^2 \\,dA$ is, by definition, the polar moment of inertia $J$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$U_{segment} = \\int_0^L \\frac{T^2 J}{2GJ^2} dx = \\int_0^L \\frac{T^2}{2GJ} dx$$\nSince $T$, $G$, and $J$ are constant for a prismatic segment, the integration yields:\n$$U_{segment} = \\frac{T^2 L}{2GJ}$$\n\nThe total strain energy $U$ of the stepped shaft is the sum of the strain energies of its three segments ($A$–$B$, $B$–$C$, and $C$–$D$):\n$$U = U_{AB} + U_{BC} + U_{CD} = \\frac{T_{AB}^2 L_1}{2 G J_1} + \\frac{T_{BC}^2 L_2}{2 G J_2} + \\frac{T_{CD}^2 L_3}{2 G J_3}$$\nwhere $T_{AB}$, $T_{BC}$, and $T_{CD}$ are the internal torques in the respective segments, and $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_3$ are their polar moments of inertia.\n\nThe system is statically indeterminate.

This provides the compatibility equation needed to solve for the redundant reaction $R_A$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial R_A} = 0$$\nWe differentiate the expression for $U(R_A)$ with respect to $R_A$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R_A} \\left[ \\frac{R_A^2 L_1}{2 G J_1} + \\frac{(R_A + T_1)^2 L_2}{2 G J_2} + \\frac{(R_A + T_1 + T_2)^2 L_3}{2 G J_3} \\right] = 0$$\n$$\\frac{2 R_A L_1}{2 G J_1} + \\frac{2(R_A + T_1) L_2}{2 G J_2} + \\frac{2(R_A + T_1 + T_2) L_3}{2 G J_3} = 0$$\nCanceling the common factor $1/G$ and simplifying, we get:\n$$\\frac{R_A L_1}{J_1} + \\frac{(R_A + T_1) L_2}{J_2} + \\frac{(R_A + T_1 + T_2) L_3}{J_3} = 0$$\nWe solve this linear equation for $R_A$:\n$$R_A \\left( \\frac{L_1}{J_1} + \\frac{L_2}{J_2} + \\frac{L_3}{J_3} \\right) = - \\left( \\frac{T_1 L_2}{J_2} + \\frac{(T_1 + T_2) L_3}{J_3} \\right)$$\n$$R_A = - \\frac{\\frac{T_1 L_2}{J_2} + \\frac{(T_1 + T_2) L_3}{J_3}}{\\frac{L_1}{J_1} + \\frac{L_2}{J_2} + \\frac{L_3}{J_3}}$$\nThe other reaction, $R_D$, is found from the static equilibrium equation for the entire shaft:\n$$R_A + T_1 + T_2 + R_D = 0 \\implies R_D = -(R_A + T_1 + T_2)$$\n\nNow we proceed with numerical calculation using SI units ($m$, $N$, $Pa$).\nGiven data:\n$L_1 = 0.40 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $d_1 = 0.040 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$L_2 = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $d_2 = 0.030 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$L_3 = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $d_3 = 0.050 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$T_1 = 1.60 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$\n$T_2 = 0.90 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$\n\nThe polar moments of inertia ($J = \\pi d^4 / 32$) are:\n$J_1 = \\frac{\\pi (0.040)^4}{32} \\approx 2.5133 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{m^4}$\n$J_2 = \\frac{\\pi (0.030)^4}{32} \\approx 7.9522 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m^4}$\n$J_3 = \\frac{\\pi (0.050)^4}{32} \\approx 6.1359 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{m^4}$\n\nWe calculate the torsional flexibility terms $L/J$:\n$\\frac{L_1}{J_1} = \\frac{0.40}{2.5133 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 1.5915 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n$\\frac{L_2}{J_2} = \\frac{0.70}{7.9522 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 8.8027 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n$\\frac{L_3}{J_3} = \\frac{0.50}{6.1359 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 8.1488 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n\nThe denominator in the expression for $R_A$ is the sum of these terms:\n$\\sum \\frac{L_i}{J_i} \\approx (1.5915 + 8.8027 + 0.81488) \\times 10^6 = 11.2091 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n\nThe numerator terms are:\n$\\frac{T_1 L_2}{J_2} = (1.60 \\times 10^3) \\times (8.8027 \\times 10^6) \\approx 1.4084 \\times 10^{10} \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m/m^3}$\n$\\frac{(T_1 + T_2) L_3}{J_3} = (1.60 \\times 10^3 + 0.90 \\times 10^3) \\times (8.1488 \\times 10^5) = (2.50 \\times 10^3) \\times (8.1488 \\times 10^5) \\approx 2.0372 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m/m^3}$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$1.4084 \\times 10^{10} + 0.20372 \\times 10^{10} = 1.61212 \\times 10^{10} \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m/m^3}$\n\nNow, we calculate $R_A$:\n$$R_A = - \\frac{1.61212 \\times 10^{10}}{11.2091 \\times 10^6} \\approx -1438.25 \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R_A = -1438 \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.
