It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of mechanics of materials. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Additional Idealization**\nIn addition to the assumptions provided, one crucial idealization will be made: the distributed load $w_{0}$ is assumed to be applied in the plane of the web. As the cross-section is symmetric, this plane contains the vertical principal axis of the cross-section. This ensures the beam undergoes only bending and shear, without any torsional effects.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Internal Forces $V(x)$ and $M(x)$**\nLet a coordinate system be established with the origin at the left support (pin at $x=0$) and the beam extending to the right support (roller at $x=L$). Due to the simply supported boundary conditions, there are vertical reactions $R_{A}$ at $x=0$ and $R_{B}$ at $x=L$.\n\nFrom static equilibrium of the entire beam, the sum of vertical forces must be zero:\n$$ \\sum F_{y} = R_{A} + R_{B} - w_{0}L = 0 $$\n$$ R_{A} + R_{B} = w_{0}L $$\nDue to the symmetry of the loading and supports, the reactions must be equal:\n$$ R_{A} = R_{B} = \\frac{w_{0}L}{2} $$\n\nTo find the internal shear force $V(x)$ and bending moment $M(x)$, we consider a free-body diagram of a segment of the beam of length $x$ from the left support ($0 \\le x \\le L$).\nApplying the equilibrium equation for vertical forces to this segment:\n$$ \\sum F_{y} = R_{A} - w_{0}x - V(x) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the value of $R_{A}$:\n$$ V(x) = R_{A} - w_{0}x = \\frac{w_{0}L}{2} - w_{0}x $$\n\nApplying the equilibrium equation for moments about the cut section at position $x$:\n$$ \\sum M_{x} = M(x) - R_{A}x + (w_{0}x)\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ M(x) = R_{A}x - \\frac{w_{0}x^{2}}{2} = \\frac{w_{0}Lx}{2} - \\frac{w_{0}x^{2}}{2} $$\n\n**Part 2: Location of Maximum Shear Force**\nThe shear force is given by the linear function $V(x) = w_{0}\\left(\\frac{L}{2} - x\\right)$. We are interested in its maximum magnitude, $|V(x)|$.\nAt the left support, $x=0$:\n$$ V(0) = \\frac{w_{0}L}{2} $$\nAt the right support, $x=L$:\n$$ V(L) = \\frac{w_{0}L}{2} - w_{0}L = -\\frac{w_{0}L}{2} $$\nThe magnitude of the shear force is maximized at the supports, i.e., at $x=0$ and $x=L$. The maximum magnitude is:\n$$ |V|_{max} = \\frac{w_{0}L}{2} $$\n\n**Part 3: Maximum Shear Flow in the Web at the Neutral Axis**\nThe shear flow $q$ at a point in the cross-section is given by $q = \\frac{VQ}{I}$. The maximum shear flow will occur where $|V|$ is maximum, so we use $V = |V|_{max} = \\frac{w_{0}L}{2}$. The problem asks for this flow at the neutral axis.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the second moment of area, $I$, of the cross-section about its neutral axis. The neutral axis coincides with the geometric centroidal axis due to symmetry. Using the thin-walled approximation specified:\nThe total $I$ is the sum of the second moment of area of the web, $I_{web}$, and the flanges, $2I_{flange}$, about the neutral axis.\n$$ I_{web} = \\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{3}}{12} $$\nFor each flange, using the parallel axis theorem, $I_{flange} = I_{c} + Ad^{2}$. The problem states to neglect the term for in-plane bending, $I_{c} = \\frac{b_{f}t_{f}^{3}}{12}$. The area of one flange is $A_{f} = b_{f}t_{f}$. The distance from the neutral axis to the centroid of a flange is $d = \\frac{h_{w}}{2} + \\frac{t_{f}}{2}$.\n$$ I_{flange} \\approx A_{f}d^{2} = (b_{f}t_{f})\\left(\\frac{h_{w} + t_{f}}{2}\\right)^{2} $$\nThe total second moment of area for the entire I-section is:\n$$ I = I_{web} + 2I_{flange} = \\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{3}}{12} + 2(b_{f}t_{f})\\frac{(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}}{4} $$\n$$ I = \\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{3}}{12} + \\frac{b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}}{2} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the first moment of area, $Q_{NA}$, for the area above the neutral axis, with respect to the neutral axis. This area consists of the top flange and the upper half of the web.\n$$ Q_{NA} = Q_{flange} + Q_{web, top \\ half} $$\nThe first moment of area of the top flange is its area multiplied by the distance of its centroid from the neutral axis:\n$$ Q_{flange} = (b_{f}t_{f})\\left(\\frac{h_{w} + t_{f}}{2}\\right) $$\nThe first moment of area of the upper half of the web (a rectangle of size $t_{w} \\times \\frac{h_{w}}{2}$) is its area multiplied by the distance of its centroid from the neutral axis:\n$$ Q_{web, top \\ half} = \\left(t_{w}\\frac{h_{w}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{h_{w}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{8} $$\nSo, the total first moment of area at the neutral axis is:\n$$ Q_{NA} = \\frac{b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})}{2} + \\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{8} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the magnitude of the maximum shear flow, $q_{max}$, which occurs in the web at the neutral axis of the cross-section subjected to the maximum shear force $|V|_{max}$.\n$$ q_{max} = \\frac{|V|_{max} Q_{NA}}{I} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $|V|_{max}$, $Q_{NA}$, and $I$:\n$$ q_{max} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{w_{0}L}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})}{2} + \\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{8}\\right)}{\\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{3}}{12} + \\frac{b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}}{2}} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we find common denominators for the numerator's parenthesis and the overall denominator.\nThe term in the numerator becomes:\n$$ \\frac{4b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f}) + t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{8} $$\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$ \\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{3} + 6b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}}{12} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $q_{max}$:\n$$ q_{max} = \\frac{\\frac{w_{0}L}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f}) + t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{8}}{\\frac{t_{w}h_{w}^{3} + 6b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}}{12}} $$\n$$ q_{max} = \\frac{w_{0}L}{16} \\cdot \\frac{12}{1} \\cdot \\frac{4b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f}) + t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{t_{w}h_{w}^{3} + 6b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}} $$\nSimplifying the numerical factor $\\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4}$:\n$$ q_{max} = \\frac{3w_{0}L}{4} \\left(\\frac{4b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f}) + t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{t_{w}h_{w}^{3} + 6b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}}\\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form symbolic expression for the maximum shear flow magnitude.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{3w_{0}L}{4}\\frac{4b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f}) + t_{w}h_{w}^{2}}{t_{w}h_{w}^{3} + 6b_{f}t_{f}(h_{w} + t_{f})^{2}}} $$", "id": "2928046"}, {"introduction": "Classical Euler-Bernoulli beam theory assumes that cross-sections remain perpendicular to the beam's axis after deformation, which effectively neglects the contribution of shear to deflection.

The kinematic assumptions of Timoshenko beam theory state that the total deflection $w(x)$ is a function of position $x$, and that plane cross-sections remain plane but do not necessarily remain perpendicular to the deformed beam axis.

We first compute the ratio $\\delta_s/\\delta_b$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_s}{\\delta_b} = \\frac{PL/(4kAG)}{PL^3/(48EI)} = \\frac{12EI}{kAGL^2} $$\nSubstitute the expressions for the second moment of area $I=bh^3/12$, area $A=bh$, shear correction factor $k=5/6$, and shear modulus $G=E/[2(1+\\nu)]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_s}{\\delta_b} = \\frac{12E(bh^3/12)}{(5/6)(bh)(E/[2(1+\\nu)])L^2} = \\frac{Ebh^3}{\\frac{5}{12} \\frac{Ebh L^2}{1+\\nu}} = \\frac{12h^2(1+\\nu)}{5L^2} $$\nThe fraction $f$ can be written as:\n$$ f = \\frac{\\delta_s}{\\delta_b+\\delta_s} = \\frac{\\delta_s/\\delta_b}{1+\\delta_s/\\delta_b} $$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio $\\delta_s/\\delta_b$:\n$$ f = \\frac{\\frac{12h^2(1+\\nu)}{5L^2}}{1+\\frac{12h^2(1+\\nu)}{5L^2}} = \\frac{12h^2(1+\\nu)}{5L^2+12h^2(1+\\nu)} $$\nFinally, we express $f$ in terms of the slenderness ratio $\\lambda = L/h$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $h^2$:\n$$ f = \\frac{12(1+\\nu)}{5(L/h)^2+12(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{12(1+\\nu)}{5\\lambda^2+12(1+\\nu)} $$\nThis completes the derivation.
