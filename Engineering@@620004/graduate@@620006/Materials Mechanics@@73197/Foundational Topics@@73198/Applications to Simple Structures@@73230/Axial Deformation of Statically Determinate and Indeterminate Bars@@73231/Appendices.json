Determination of Vertical Displacement at Joint C**\n\nThe problem requires invoking reciprocity, which refers to Betti's reciprocal theorem. To find the displacement at a point $C$ due to a load at point $C$, we utilize the principle of virtual forces, which is a direct consequence of Betti's theorem applied to a real and a virtual system.\n\nSystem 1 (Real): The actual applied load $P = 6 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N}$ at joint $C$. We calculate the resulting axial force, $F_i$, in each member $i$. By static equilibrium at joint $C$, and considering symmetry ($F_{AC} = F_{BC}$):\n$$\\sum F_y = 0: \\quad F_{AC}\\sin(\\theta) + F_{BC}\\sin(\\theta) - P = 0$$\n$$2 F_{AC} \\sin(\\theta) = P \\implies F_{AC} = \\frac{P}{2\\sin(\\theta)}$$\nSubstituting values:\n$$F_{AC} = F_{BC} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N}}{2 \\times 0.8} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N}}{1.6} = 3.75 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\nThese members are in compression. The actual elongation of each member is $\\Delta L_i = \\frac{F_i L_i}{A_i E_i}$.\n\nSystem 2 (Virtual): A dimensionless unit virtual load, $P^* = 1$, is applied at joint $C$ in the direction of the desired displacement (vertical). We calculate the corresponding virtual axial force, $f_i$, in each member.\n$$f_{AC} = f_{BC} = \\frac{P^*}{2\\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 0.8} = \\frac{1}{1.6} = 0.625$$\n\nThe principle of virtual forces equates external virtual work to internal virtual work:\n$$P^* \\cdot \\delta_{C,v} = \\sum_i f_i \\cdot \\Delta L_i = \\sum_i f_i \\left( \\frac{F_i L_i}{A_i E_i} \\right)$$\nSince $P^*=1$, the vertical displacement at $C$, $\\delta_{C,v}$, is:\n$$\\delta_{C,v} = \\frac{f_{AC} F_{AC} L}{A_b E} + \\frac{f_{BC} F_{BC} L}{A_b E} = 2 \\frac{f_{AC} F_{AC} L}{A_b E}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\delta_{C,v} = 2 \\frac{(0.625) (3.75 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N}) (2.5\\,\\mathrm{m})}{(6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (2 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}^2)}$$\n$$\\delta_{C,v} = \\frac{1.171875 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}}{1.2 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{N/m}} = 0.0009765625\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**2. Computation of Total Strain Energy from External Work**\n\nThe problem invokes Clapeyron's theorem, which states that for a linear elastic system, the total strain energy $U$ is equal to one-half the work done by the external forces acting through the final displacements they produce. For a single applied force $P$ causing a displacement $\\delta$ in its direction of action:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2} P \\delta_{C,v}$$\nUsing the displacement calculated in the previous step:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2} (6 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N}) (0.0009765625\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$U = (3 \\times 10^4) \\times (0.0009765625)\\,\\mathrm{J} = 29.296875\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n\n**3. Independent Computation of Strain Energy and Verification**\n\nThe strain energy stored in a single axially loaded elastic member is given by the formula:\n$$U_i = \\frac{F_i^2 L_i}{2 A_i E_i}$$\nThe total strain energy of the truss is the sum of the energies stored in its members. Due to symmetry, $U_{total} = U_{AC} + U_{BC} = 2 U_{AC}$.\n$$U = 2 \\left( \\frac{F_{AC}^2 L}{2 A_b E} \\right) = \\frac{F_{AC}^2 L}{A_b E}$$\nSubstituting the values for the axial force $F_{AC}$, length $L$, area $A_b$, and modulus $E$:\n$$U = \\frac{(3.75 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N})^2 (2.5\\,\\mathrm{m})}{(6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (2 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}^2)}$$\n$$U = \\frac{(1.40625 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{N}^2) (2.5\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.2 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{N/m}} = \\frac{3.515625 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{N^2 \\cdot m}}{1.2 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{N/m}}$$\n$$U = 29.296875\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe result from the summation of internal strain energies is identical to the result obtained from the external work via Clapeyron's theorem. This confirms the consistency of the calculations and the correctness of the application of the underlying principles.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer in Joules, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$U \\approx 29.30\\,\\mathrm{J}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{29.30}\n$$", "id": "2618427"}, {"introduction": "Next, we advance to statically indeterminate systems, where equilibrium equations alone are insufficient to determine the internal forces.

The total change in length of the bar is the integral of the strain over its length:\n    $$ u(L) - u(0) = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon(x) dx $$\n    Given the clamped ends, this change must be zero:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\varepsilon(x) dx = 0 $$\n    We substitute the constitutive and equilibrium relations into this compatibility equation to solve for the unknown force $N_0$:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\left(\\frac{\\sigma(x)}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T(x)\\right) dx = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{N_0}{E} \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} + \\alpha \\int_0^L \\Delta T(x) dx = 0 $$\n    We evaluate the two integrals. The first integral is:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} = \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A_0\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{A_0} \\left[ \\frac{L}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right) \\right]_0^L = \\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma) $$\n    This expression is valid for $\\gamma \\neq 0$. In the limit $\\gamma \\to 0$, $\\frac{\\ln(1+\\gamma)}{\\gamma} \\to 1$, so the integral becomes $\\frac{L}{A_0}$, which is correct for a prismatic bar.\n    The second integral is:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\Delta T(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\left(T_c + T_g \\frac{x}{L}\\right) dx = \\left[ T_c x + \\frac{T_g x^2}{2L} \\right]_0^L = T_c L + \\frac{T_g L}{2} = L\\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right) $$\n    Substituting these results into the compatibility equation:\n    $$ \\frac{N_0}{E} \\left(\\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right) + \\alpha L\\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\n    Solving for $N_0$:\n    $$ N_0 = - \\frac{E A_0 \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} $$\n    Finally, the axial stress $\\sigma(x)$ is:\n    $$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{N_0}{A(x)} = - \\frac{E \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}} $$\n\n**2. Strain Energy Density $\\psi(x)$**\n\nThe strain energy density function $\\psi$ in an elastic material represents the recoverable mechanical work done per unit volume. It is a function of the state of strain. For a thermoelastic material, this energy is stored only in the mechanical part of the deformation, not the thermal expansion part. The definition from first principles is the work done by the stress on the mechanical strain:\n$$ \\psi = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_m} \\sigma(\\varepsilon'_m) d\\varepsilon'_m $$\nFor a linear elastic material, $\\sigma = E \\varepsilon_m$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ \\psi = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_m} E \\varepsilon'_m d\\varepsilon'_m = \\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon_m)^2 $$\nUsing the constitutive relation $\\varepsilon_m = \\sigma/E$, we can express the strain energy density in terms of stress, which is more convenient here:\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)^2}{2E} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma(x)$:\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{2E} \\left( - \\frac{E \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{E \\alpha^2 \\gamma^2 \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{2\\left(\\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right)^2} \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right)^2} $$\n\n**3. Total Stored Elastic Energy $U$**\n\nThe total stored elastic energy $U$ is the integral of the strain energy density $\\psi(x)$ over the entire volume $V$ of the bar. The differential volume element is $dV = A(x) dx$.\n$$ U = \\int_V \\psi(x) dV = \\int_0^L \\psi(x) A(x) dx $$\nAn alternative and more direct calculation for $U$ is as follows:\n$$ U = \\int_0^L \\frac{\\sigma(x)^2}{2E} A(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\frac{1}{2E} \\left(\\frac{N_0}{A(x)}\\right)^2 A(x) dx = \\frac{N_0^2}{2E} \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} $$\nWe have already computed the integral $\\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} = \\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma)$.\nWe now substitute the expressions for $N_0^2$ and the integral:\n$$ N_0^2 = \\left( - \\frac{E A_0 \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{E^2 A_0^2 \\alpha^2 \\gamma^2 \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right)^2} $$\n$$ U = \\frac{1}{2E} \\left( \\frac{E^2 A_0^2 \\alpha^2 \\gamma^2 \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right)^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma) \\right) $$\nSimplifying this expression by cancelling terms:\n$$ U = \\frac{E A_0 \\alpha^2 \\gamma L \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{2\\ln(1+\\gamma)} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the total stored elastic energy in the bar. The dimensionality of this expression is force-length, consistent with energy, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{E A_{0} \\alpha^{2} \\gamma L \\left(T_{c} + \\frac{T_{g}}{2}\\right)^{2}}{2 \\ln\\left(1+\\gamma\\right)}}$$", "id": "2688021"}]}
