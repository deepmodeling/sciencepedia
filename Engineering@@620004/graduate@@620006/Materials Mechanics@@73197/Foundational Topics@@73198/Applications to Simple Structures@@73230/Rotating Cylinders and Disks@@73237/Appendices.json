A full derivation and analysis shall follow.\n\n**Derivation of Governing Equations and General Solution**\n\nThe analysis must begin from fundamental principles as instructed.\n\n1.  **Radial Equilibrium**: For an axisymmetric element of the disk, the equilibrium of forces in the radial direction, including the inertial (centrifugal) body force per unit volume $F_r = \\rho \\omega^2 r$, gives the equation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - \\sigma_\\theta}{r} + \\rho \\omega^2 r = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Kinematic Relations**: For axisymmetric deformation, the radial strain $\\epsilon_r$ and circumferential (hoop) strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$ are related to the radial displacement $u(r)$ by:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_r = \\frac{du}{dr}, \\quad \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{u}{r}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Constitutive Law (Hooke's Law for Plane Stress)**: For an isotropic, linear elastic material under plane stress ($\\sigma_z=0$):\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_r = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_r - \\nu\\sigma_\\theta)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu\\sigma_r)\n    $$\n    These can be inverted to express stresses in terms of strains:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_r = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_r + \\nu\\epsilon_\\theta) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu\\frac{u}{r}\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu\\epsilon_r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{u}{r} + \\nu\\frac{du}{dr}\\right)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Governing Equation for Displacement**: Substituting the stress-displacement relations into the equilibrium equation yields the governing non-homogeneous differential equation for $u(r)$, known as Navier's equation for this specific problem:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{u}{r^2} = -\\frac{(1-\\nu^2)\\rho\\omega^2}{E}r\n    $$\n    The general solution to this equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution ($u_h = C_1 r + C_2/r$) and a particular solution ($u_p \\propto r^3$):\n    $$\n    u(r) = C_1 r + \\frac{C_2}{r} - \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)\\rho\\omega^2}{8E}r^3\n    $$\n    where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\n5.  **General Stress Solutions**: Substituting the general solution for $u(r)$ back into the stress-displacement relations, we obtain the general expressions for the radial and circumferential stresses. It is convenient to define new constants $A$ and $B$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_r(r) = A - \\frac{B}{r^2} - \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 r^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\sigma_\\theta(r) = A + \\frac{B}{r^2} - \\frac{1+3\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 r^2\n    $$\n    The constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the boundary conditions $u(a)=0$ and $\\sigma_r(b)=0$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nNow, each statement is evaluated.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis statement constitutes a local condition and is the most direct to verify.\nThe statement is: \"The bore clamp enforces a local proportionality at $r=a$ between circumferential and radial stresses that is independent of $\\omega$ and geometry: $\\sigma_\\theta(a)=\\nu\\,\\sigma_r(a)$.\"\n\nThe boundary condition at the clamped bore is $u(a)=0$.\nFrom the kinematic relations, the circumferential strain at the bore is $\\epsilon_\\theta(a) = u(a)/a$.\nGiven $u(a)=0$, it follows immediately that $\\epsilon_\\theta(a) = 0$.\nNow, consider Hooke's law for the circumferential strain at $r=a$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\theta(a) = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_\\theta(a) - \\nu\\sigma_r(a))\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon_\\theta(a)=0$, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_\\theta(a) - \\nu\\sigma_r(a)) \\implies \\sigma_\\theta(a) = \\nu\\sigma_r(a)\n$$\nThis relationship is a direct consequence of the kinematic constraint $u(a)=0$ and the constitutive law. It holds true regardless of the outer radius $b$, the angular speed $\\omega$, or the material density $\\rho$. It depends only on Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.\n\n**Verdict for B**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThe statement is: \"With $u(a)=0$ and $\\sigma_r(b)=0$, the radial stress at the bore is strictly positive, $\\sigma_r(a)>0$, for any $b>a$ and any admissible $\\nu\\in(0, \\tfrac{1}{2})$. The mechanical traction that the clamp exerts on the bore points radially inward.\"\n\nTo determine the sign of $\\sigma_r(a)$, we must solve for the constants $A$ and $B$ using the two boundary conditions:\n1. $u(a)=0$: As shown for Option B, this is equivalent to $\\sigma_\\theta(a) = \\nu\\sigma_r(a)$.\n2. $\\sigma_r(b)=0$.\n\nApplying these conditions to the general stress solutions:\nFrom $\\sigma_r(b)=0$:\n$$ A - \\frac{B}{b^2} - \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 b^2 = 0 \\implies A = \\frac{B}{b^2} + \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 b^2 $$\nFrom $\\sigma_\\theta(a) = \\nu\\sigma_r(a)$:\n$$ A + \\frac{B}{a^2} - \\frac{1+3\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 a^2 = \\nu\\left(A - \\frac{B}{a^2} - \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 a^2\\right) $$\nSolving this system of equations for $A$ and $B$ and substituting into the expression for $\\sigma_r(a)$ leads to a complicated expression. A more demonstrative path is to express $\\sigma_r(a)$ differently. After substantial algebraic manipulation, one can find:\n$$\n\\sigma_r(a) = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2 b^2}{4} \\frac{(3+\\nu) - 2(1+\\nu)(a/b)^2 - (1-\\nu)(a/b)^4}{(1-\\nu)(a/b)^2 + (1+\\nu)}\n$$\nTo determine the sign of $\\sigma_r(a)$, we only need to analyze the sign of the numerator of the fractional term, as all other terms are positive for $b>a$ and $\\nu \\in (0, 1/2)$. Let $x = a/b$, where $0 < x < 1$. Define the function $f(x) = (3+\\nu) - 2(1+\\nu)x^2 - (1-\\nu)x^4$.\nWe test the value at the endpoint $x=1$ (corresponding to $a=b$):\n$$\nf(1) = (3+\\nu) - 2(1+\\nu) - (1-\\nu) = 3+\\nu-2-2\\nu-1+\\nu = 0\n$$\nNow, we examine the derivative of $f(x)$ for $x \\in (0,1)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = -4(1+\\nu)x - 4(1-\\nu)x^3 = -4x [ (1+\\nu) + (1-\\nu)x^2 ]\n$$\nFor $x>0$ and $\\nu \\in (0, 1/2)$, both $(1+\\nu)$ and $(1-\\nu)$ are positive, so $f'(x) < 0$. This means $f(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function on the interval $(0,1)$. Since $f(1)=0$ and the function is decreasing, it must be that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$.\nThis proves that $\\sigma_r(a)$ is strictly positive for any $b>a$.\n\nA positive $\\sigma_r(a)$ means the stress is tensile. The material at the bore is being pulled radially outward. The traction vector exerted by the material on the clamp is $\\vec{T} = \\sigma_r(a) \\hat{e}_r$, which points outward. By Newton's third law, the force (traction) that the clamp exerts on the disk material is $-\\vec{T} = -\\sigma_r(a) \\hat{e}_r$, which points radially inward.\n\n**Verdict for A**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThe statement is: \"For the clamped-bore annulus, the circumferential stress at the outer rim remains tensile for all $\\omega$, $b>a$, and $\\nu\\in(0, \\tfrac{1}{2})$; it cannot become compressive merely by increasing $\\omega$.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate $\\sigma_\\theta(b)$. We have the general solutions at $r=b$:\n$$\n\\sigma_r(b) = A - \\frac{B}{b^2} - \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 b^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta(b) = A + \\frac{B}{b^2} - \\frac{1+3\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 b^2\n$$\nThe boundary condition $\\sigma_r(b)=0$ provides a simplification. We can write $\\sigma_\\theta(b)$ in terms of $\\sigma_r(b)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta(b) = \\sigma_r(b) + \\frac{2B}{b^2} - \\left(\\frac{1+3\\nu}{8} - \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\right)\\rho\\omega^2 b^2\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_r(b)=0$:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta(b) = \\frac{2B}{b^2} - \\frac{2\\nu-2}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 b^2 = \\frac{2B}{b^2} + \\frac{1-\\nu}{4}\\rho\\omega^2 b^2\n$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $B$, after a lengthy but straightforward algebraic simplification, yields:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta(b) = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2(1-\\nu^2)}{4} \\frac{(b^2-a^2)^2}{b^2(1+\\nu)+a^2(1-\\nu)}\n$$\nLet's examine the sign of this expression. Given $\\rho>0$, $\\omega^2 \\ge 0$. For the admissible range $\\nu \\in (0, 1/2)$, the term $(1-\\nu^2)$ is positive. The term $(b^2-a^2)^2$ is strictly positive since $b>a$. The denominator $b^2(1+\\nu)+a^2(1-\\nu)$ is also clearly positive.\nTherefore, $\\sigma_\\theta(b) > 0$ for any non-zero $\\omega$. The circumferential stress at the outer rim is always tensile.\nThe stress is proportional to $\\omega^2$, so increasing $\\omega$ only increases its magnitude, it cannot change its sign from tensile to compressive.\n\n**Verdict for D**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThe statement is: \"Clamping the bore necessarily moves the location of the maximum circumferential stress away from the bore and into the interior $a<r<b$, regardless of geometry.\"\n\nFor a free rotating annulus ($\\sigma_r(a)=\\sigma_r(b)=0$), the maximum hoop stress always occurs at the bore, $r=a$. The statement claims that clamping ($u(a)=0$) always shifts this maximum to an interior point $r \\in (a,b)$.\n\nTo find the location of maximum $\\sigma_\\theta$, we examine its derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} = -\\frac{2B}{r^3} - 2\\left(\\frac{1+3\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2\\right)r\n$$\nFrom the analysis for Option A, we have the constants $A>0$ and $B<0$. Let $B = -|B|$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} = \\frac{2|B|}{r^3} - \\frac{1+3\\nu}{4}\\rho\\omega^2 r\n$$\nThe sign of the derivative at the bore, $r=a$, determines if the stress initially increases or decreases. If $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr}|_{r=a} > 0$, the maximum must lie in the interior $(a,b)$. If $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr}|_{r=a} \\le 0$, the maximum occurs at the bore $r=a$.\nThe sign of $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr}|_{r=a}$ is the sign of $2|B|/a^3 - \\frac{1+3\\nu}{4}\\rho\\omega^2 a$. This is positive if $|B| > \\frac{(1+3\\nu)\\rho\\omega^2}{8}a^4$.\nIt was shown in a more detailed analysis that for a thin annulus, where the ratio $b/a$ is close to $1$, this condition is not met. Specifically, for $b/a \\to 1^+$, we have $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr}|_{r=a} < 0$. This means that for a sufficiently thin disk, the hoop stress is maximum at the clamped bore $r=a$ and decreases with increasing radius.\nThus, the statement that the maximum *necessarily* moves into the interior *regardless of geometry* is false. It depends on the geometry, specifically the ratio $b/a$.\n\n**Verdict for C**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n- Option A: Correct. The radial stress at the clamped bore is positive (tensile).\n- Option B: Correct. The condition $u(a)=0$ directly implies $\\sigma_\\theta(a) = \\nu\\sigma_r(a)$.\n- Option C: Incorrect. For a thin annulus, the maximum hoop stress remains at the bore.\n- Option D: Correct. The hoop stress at the free outer rim is always positive (tensile).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2914810"}]}
