It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and an objective test of the derivation and application of the elastic flexure formula for beams. The problem is valid and I will proceed with its solution. The solution is presented in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Flexure Formula**\n\nWe begin from the stated kinematic assumption of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory: plane cross-sections remain plane and perpendicular to the beam axis after bending. Consider a differential segment of the beam of initial length $dx$. Under a pure bending moment $M$, this segment deforms such that its neutral axis bends into a circular arc of radius $\\rho$ subtending an angle $d\\theta$. The length of the neutral axis remains unchanged, so $dx = \\rho d\\theta$.\n\nA fiber located at a distance $y$ from the neutral axis will also bend into a circular arc. Its radius of curvature will be $(\\rho - y)$. The new length of this fiber is $ds' = (\\rho - y)d\\theta$. The normal strain along the $x$-axis, $\\varepsilon_x$, is defined as the change in length per unit original length:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{x} = \\frac{ds' - dx}{dx} = \\frac{(\\rho - y)d\\theta - \\rho d\\theta}{\\rho d\\theta} = \\frac{-\\,y d\\theta}{\\rho d\\theta} = -\\frac{y}{\\rho}\n$$\nThe curvature of the beam's neutral axis is defined as $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{\\rho}$. Thus, the normal strain field is linear through the depth of the beam:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{x}(y) = -\\kappa y\n$$\nThe material is stated to be linearly elastic and isotropic. For uniaxial stress in the $x$-direction, Hooke's law gives the normal stress $\\sigma_x$ as a function of the normal strain $\\varepsilon_x$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x} = E \\varepsilon_{x}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material. Substituting the strain field, we obtain the normal stress field:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x}(y) = -E \\kappa y\n$$\nThis shows the stress also varies linearly with the distance $y$ from the neutral axis. To locate the neutral axis and relate the stress to the applied moment, we apply equilibrium conditions to the cross-section.\n\nFirst, for pure bending, there is no net axial force on the cross-section. The total axial force $F_x$ is the integral of the stress over the area $A$:\n$$\nF_{x} = \\int_{A} \\sigma_{x} dA = \\int_{A} (-E \\kappa y) dA = -E \\kappa \\int_{A} y dA = 0\n$$\nSince for non-trivial bending, $E \\neq 0$ and $\\kappa \\neq 0$, it must be that $\\int_{A} y dA = 0$. This integral is the first moment of area of the cross-section about the $z$-axis. The condition that it is zero signifies that the $z$-axis, which is the neutral axis of bending, must pass through the centroid of the cross-section. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSecond, the resultant internal moment generated by the stress distribution must be equal to the applied external moment, $M$. The moment is taken about the $z$-axis. The differential moment $dM$ from the stress on a differential area $dA$ at position $y$ is $dM = -y(\\sigma_x dA)$. The sign convention ensures a positive stress at a positive $y$ produces a negative moment.\n$$\nM = \\int_{A} (-y) \\sigma_{x} dA = \\int_{A} (-y)(-E \\kappa y) dA = E \\kappa \\int_{A} y^2 dA\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{A} y^2 dA$ is the second moment of area (or area moment of inertia) of the cross-section about the centroidal $z$-axis, denoted by $I_{zz}$.\n$$\nI_{zz} = \\int_{A} y^2 dA\n$$\nThus, we arrive at the moment-curvature relation:\n$$\nM = E I_{zz} \\kappa\n$$\nThis equation relates the applied moment $M$, the material property $E$, the geometric property $I_{zz}$, and the resulting curvature $\\kappa$.\n\nFinally, to express the stress in terms of the applied moment $M$, we rearrange the moment-curvature relation to find $\\kappa = \\frac{M}{E I_{zz}}$ and substitute this back into the stress equation $\\sigma_x(y) = -E \\kappa y$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x}(y) = -E \\left( \\frac{M}{E I_{zz}} \\right) y = -\\frac{M y}{I_{zz}}\n$$\nThis is the flexure formula, which gives the normal stress distribution as a function of the applied moment $M$, the second moment of area $I_{zz}$, and the position $y$ from the neutral axis.\n\n**Part 2: Second Moment of Area for a Cross-section with a Hole**\n\nWe are asked to prove a property of the second moment of area for a composite shape formed by removing a hole from an outer region, where the centroids of both regions coincide. Let $A_{\\text{outer}}$ be the area of the outer region and $A_{\\text{hole}}$ be the area of the hole. The net area of the cross-section is $A_{\\text{with hole}} = A_{\\text{outer}} \\setminus A_{\\text{hole}}$.\n\nThe second moment of area of the cross-section with the hole about the centroidal $z$-axis, $I_{zz,\\text{with hole}}$, is defined by the integral:\n$$\nI_{zz,\\text{with hole}} = \\int_{A_{\\text{with hole}}} y^2 dA\n$$\nDue to the additive property of integrals over disjoint domains, the integral over the net area is the integral over the outer area minus the integral over the hole area:\n$$\nI_{zz,\\text{with hole}} = \\int_{A_{\\text{outer}}} y^2 dA - \\int_{A_{\\text{hole}}} y^2 dA\n$$\nThe first term, $\\int_{A_{\\text{outer}}} y^2 dA$, is by definition the second moment of area of the solid outer region about the $z$-axis, which we denote as $I_{zz,\\text{outer}}$.\nThe second term, $\\int_{A_{\\text{hole}}} y^2 dA$, is the second moment of area of the shape of the hole about the same $z$-axis.\n\nThe problem states that the centroid of the hole coincides with the centroid of the outer region. The $z$-axis passes through this common centroid. Therefore, the integral $\\int_{A_{\\text{hole}}} y^2 dA$ is computed about the centroidal axis of the hole's shape. We denote this as $I_{zz,\\text{hole, centroidal}}$. Consequently, we have proven the required relation:\n$$\nI_{zz,\\text{with hole}} = I_{zz,\\text{outer}} - I_{zz,\\text{hole, centroidal}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Stress Increase Factor**\n\nWe now apply these results to the specific case of a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and height $h$ with a centered circular hole of diameter $d$. The applied bending moment is $M$. We want to find the multiplicative increase in the magnitude of the extreme-fiber normal stress caused by the hole. The extreme fibers are located at $y = \\pm \\frac{h}{2}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, the magnitude of the normal stress is $|\\sigma_{x}(y)| = \\frac{M|y|}{I_{zz}}$. The magnitude of the extreme-fiber stress is:\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{max}}| = \\frac{M (h/2)}{I_{zz}}\n$$\nFirst, consider the solid rectangular cross-section (without a hole). Its second moment of area about the centroidal $z$-axis is a standard result:\n$$\nI_{zz,\\text{solid}} = \\frac{b h^3}{12}\n$$\nThe extreme-fiber stress for the solid beam is:\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{max, solid}}| = \\frac{M (h/2)}{I_{zz,\\text{solid}}} = \\frac{M h/2}{b h^3/12} = \\frac{6M}{b h^2}\n$$\nNext, consider the rectangular cross-section with the centered circular hole. The outer region is the rectangle, so $I_{zz,\\text{outer}} = \\frac{b h^3}{12}$. The hole is a circle of diameter $d$ (radius $r = d/2$), and its centroidal second moment of area about a diameter is:\n$$\nI_{zz,\\text{hole, centroidal}} = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (d/2)^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}\n$$\nUsing the result from Part 2, the second moment of area for the cross-section with the hole is:\n$$\nI_{zz,\\text{with hole}} = I_{zz,\\text{outer}} - I_{zz,\\text{hole, centroidal}} = \\frac{b h^3}{12} - \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}\n$$\nThe extreme-fiber stress for the beam with the hole is still evaluated at $y = \\pm \\frac{h}{2}$:\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{max, hole}}| = \\frac{M (h/2)}{I_{zz,\\text{with hole}}} = \\frac{M h/2}{\\frac{b h^3}{12} - \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}}\n$$\nThe multiplicative increase factor is the ratio of the stress in the beam with the hole to the stress in the solid beam:\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{\\text{max, hole}}|}{|\\sigma_{\\text{max, solid}}|} = \\frac{\\frac{M h/2}{I_{zz,\\text{with hole}}}}{\\frac{M h/2}{I_{zz,\\text{solid}}}} = \\frac{I_{zz,\\text{solid}}}{I_{zz,\\text{with hole}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the second moments of area:\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{b h^3}{12}}{\\frac{b h^3}{12} - \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can write it as:\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\pi d^4/64}{b h^3/12}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{12 \\pi d^4}{64 b h^3}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{3 \\pi d^4}{16 b h^3}}\n$$\nAlternatively, multiplying the numerator and denominator of the original ratio by the common denominator $192$:\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{b h^3}{12}}{\\frac{16 b h^3 - 3 \\pi d^4}{192}} = \\frac{b h^3}{12} \\cdot \\frac{192}{16 b h^3 - 3 \\pi d^4} = \\frac{16 b h^3}{16 b h^3 - 3 \\pi d^4}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the stress increase factor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{16 b h^3}{16 b h^3 - 3 \\pi d^4}}\n$$", "id": "2880562"}, {"introduction": "Building on the theoretical foundation, this practice moves to a common engineering scenario: a beam with a composite cross-section.

This exercise will sharpen your data analysis skills and deepen your understanding of how to use empirical evidence to validate a theoretical model and determine key physical parameters, such as the location of the neutral axis, $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}$.", "problem": "A prismatic beam with an unknown, possibly non-symmetric cross-section is tested in four-point bending so that over a gage region the bending moment is constant and the transverse shear is negligible. The material exhibits small strains, linear elasticity, and the kinematic assumption of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory holds, namely that plane cross-sections remain plane and normal to the deformed centerline. At a single cross-section within the constant-moment region, four uniaxial electrical resistance strain gauges (aligned with the beam axis) are bonded on the side face at positions with known signed distances from a machinist’s datum line across the depth, taken as $y=0$. Two gauges are placed at $y=+15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $y=-15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and two at $y=+5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $y=-5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Under a given load level, the measured axial normal strains are:\n- at $y=+15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\varepsilon_{xx}=640\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$,\n- at $y=-15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\varepsilon_{xx}=-560\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$,\n- at $y=+5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\varepsilon_{xx}=240\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$,\n- at $y=-5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\varepsilon_{xx}=-160\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental laws and core definitions of small-strain kinematics and linear elasticity, together with the plane-sections kinematics of Euler–Bernoulli beams, identify which of the following procedures correctly (i) verifies whether the axial strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ varies linearly with the transverse coordinate $y$ in this test, independent of any unknown axial (membrane) strain, and (ii) locates the neutral axis position $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}$ relative to the datum.

All concepts—strain, neutral axis, four-point bending—are fundamental and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of experimental data and asks to evaluate procedures for analyzing this data based on a given physical model. The data is sufficient to test the validity of the model and determine its parameters.

It is free of ambiguity and subjectivity.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The problem states that Euler-Bernoulli kinematics hold. This provides the theoretical framework—namely, a linear strain distribution. The task is to use the provided data to verify this linearity and determine the parameters. The four data points are more than the minimum of three required to check for linearity, so the problem is well-posed for this verification. There are no contradictions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed problem in experimental mechanics of materials. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental kinematic assumption of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is that plane cross-sections remain plane and normal to the centroidal axis after deformation. For small strains, this implies that the axial normal strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ varies linearly with the transverse coordinate $y$. This linear relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx}(y) = a + by $$\nHere, $y$ is the coordinate measured from the specified machinist's datum. The parameter $b$ is the gradient of the strain, which is constant and related to the beam's curvature $\\kappa$ by $b = -\\kappa$. The parameter $a$ is the strain at the datum ($y=0$), representing a uniform axial strain (membrane strain) that may be superimposed on the bending strain. The presence of a non-zero $a$ indicates that the net axial force on the cross-section is non-zero, and/or the datum line $y=0$ does not coincide with the neutral axis.\n\nThe neutral axis is the locus of points with zero axial strain. Its position, $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}$, is found by setting $\\varepsilon_{xx}(y_{\\mathrm{NA}}) = 0$:\n$$ a + by_{\\mathrm{NA}} = 0 \\implies y_{\\mathrm{NA}} = -\\frac{a}{b} $$\nThe task is therefore to use the four given data points to (i) verify that they lie on a straight line, confirming the linear model, and (ii) determine the parameters $a$ and $b$ to locate the neutral axis.\n\nWe are given:\n1. $\\varepsilon(+15\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 640\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\n2. $\\varepsilon(-15\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = -560\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\n3. $\\varepsilon(+5\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 240\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\n4. $\\varepsilon(-5\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = -160\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\n\nWe now evaluate each proposed procedure.\n\nA. For each symmetric pair at $y=\\pm y_i$, form the pairwise difference $D_i=\\varepsilon_{xx}(+y_i)-\\varepsilon_{xx}(-y_i)$ and sum $S_i=\\varepsilon_{xx}(+y_i)+\\varepsilon_{xx}(-y_i)$. Verify linearity by checking that $D_i/y_i$ is the same for $y_1=15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $y_2=5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and that $S_1=S_2$; then identify the membrane strain as $a=S_i/2$ and the slope as $b=D_i/(2y_i)$, and obtain the neutral axis by solving $\\varepsilon_{xx}(y_{\\mathrm{NA}})=0$, i.e., $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}=-a/b$. With the data, $D_{15}=1200\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$, $D_{5}=400\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$, so $D_{15}/15=D_{5}/5=80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}$ and $S_{15}=S_{5}=80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$, hence $a=40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$, $b=40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}$, and $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}=-1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThis procedure is based on decomposing the linear function $\\varepsilon_{xx}(y) = a+by$ using symmetric data points. For any pair at $\\pm y_i$:\n$S_i = \\varepsilon(+y_i) + \\varepsilon(-y_i) = (a + by_i) + (a - by_i) = 2a$\n$D_i = \\varepsilon(+y_i) - \\varepsilon(-y_i) = (a + by_i) - (a - by_i) = 2by_i$\nFor the data to conform to a single linear model, the parameters $a$ and $b$ must be constant. This means $S_i$ must be constant for all pairs, and $D_i/y_i$ must be constant for all pairs. The procedure's verification step checks exactly these conditions.\nLet's apply this to the data for $y_1 = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $y_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\nFor $y_1=15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$S_{15} = 640 + (-560) = 80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\n$D_{15} = 640 - (-560) = 1200\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\nFor $y_2=5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$S_5 = 240 + (-160) = 80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\n$D_5 = 240 - (-160) = 400\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\nNow, we verify linearity:\n1. Is $S_1 = S_2$? $S_{15} = 80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$ and $S_5 = 80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$. Yes, they are equal.\n2. Is $D_1/y_1 = D_2/y_2$? $D_{15}/15 = 1200/15 = 80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}$. $D_5/5 = 400/5 = 80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}$. Yes, they are equal.\nSince both conditions hold, the four data points lie perfectly on a single line. The procedure correctly verifies linearity.\nNext, we determine the parameters:\n$a = S_i/2 = 80/2 = 40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$\n$b = D_i/(2y_i) = 1200/(2 \\times 15) = 1200/30 = 40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}$\nFinally, we locate the neutral axis:\n$y_{\\mathrm{NA}} = -a/b = -(40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon)/(40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}) = -1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\nThe procedure is logically sound, and all calculations presented in the option are correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Place a single symmetric pair at $y=\\pm 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Declare the distribution linear and the datum to coincide with the neutral axis if and only if $\\varepsilon_{xx}(+15\\,\\mathrm{mm})=-\\varepsilon_{xx}(-15\\,\\mathrm{mm})$; otherwise declare the distribution nonlinear and the neutral axis indeterminate. With the data, since $640\\,\\mu\\varepsilon\\neq 560\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$, conclude nonlinearity and that $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}$ cannot be located.\n\nThis procedure has two fundamental flaws. First, one cannot verify linearity with only two data points. At least three are required. Second, the condition $\\varepsilon(+y_i) = -\\varepsilon(-y_i)$ is a test for whether the neutral axis coincides with the datum ($y=0$), not a test for linearity. This condition is equivalent to $S_i = \\varepsilon(+y_i) + \\varepsilon(-y_i) = 0$, which from the analysis in A implies $2a=0$, or $a=0$. If $a=0$, then $y_{\\mathrm{NA}} = -a/b = 0$. The data shows $S_{15} = 80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon \\neq 0$, which correctly implies that the neutral axis is not at the datum. However, concluding from this that the strain distribution is nonlinear is a severe misinterpretation of the theory. The procedure confuses the general linear case ($\\varepsilon_{xx} = a+by$) with the special case of pure bending about the datum ($\\varepsilon_{xx} = by$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Use the sums only: if $S_{15}=S_{5}$, then the distribution is linear and the neutral axis is at $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}=-S_{15}/D_{15}$. With the data, $S_{15}=S_{5}=80\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$, so declare linearity and report $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}\\approx -0.067\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThis procedure's check for linearity is incomplete. As established in the analysis of option A, verifying linearity requires checking for the constancy of *both* $S_i$ (which relates to $a$) and $D_i/y_i$ (which relates to $b$). Checking only $S_i$ is insufficient. For instance, a different set of data could have the same sum $S_i$ but a different slope $b$ for each pair of points, which would not represent a single straight line.\nFurthermore, the proposed formula for the neutral axis, $y_{\\mathrm{NA}} = -S_{15}/D_{15}$, is incorrect. The dimensions are wrong: $S_{15}$ and $D_{15}$ both have units of strain, so their ratio is dimensionless, whereas $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}$ must have units of length. The correct formula is $y_{\\mathrm{NA}} = -a/b = -(S_{15}/2) / (D_{15}/(2y_{15})) = -(S_{15} \\cdot y_{15}) / D_{15}$. The proposed formula is missing the factor $y_{15}$. Using the data, this incorrect formula gives $y_{\\mathrm{NA}} = -80/1200 = -1/15$, which is a dimensionless number, not the position $-1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Fit a linear model $\\varepsilon_{xx}(y)=a+by$ by least squares to all four data points. Verify linearity by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination equal to $1$ within measurement resolution), then locate the neutral axis as the zero of the fitted line, $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}=-a/b$. With the symmetric data, the fit gives $a=40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$, $b=40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}$ exactly, so $y_{\\mathrm{NA}}=-1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and linearity is verified.\n\nThis procedure describes the standard and most general method for analyzing such experimental data. Linear least squares regression finds the best-fit line $\\varepsilon_{xx}(y) = a+by$ for a given set of data points. The goodness-of-fit, typically measured by the coefficient of determination $R^2$, provides a quantitative measure of how well the data conforms to the linear model. An $R^2$ value of $1$ signifies a perfect linear relationship.\nFor the given data points, we can compute the least squares coefficients. Due to the symmetric placement of the gauges ($\\sum y_i = 0$), the formulas simplify:\n$a = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum \\varepsilon_i = \\frac{1}{4}(640 - 560 + 240 - 160) = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon$.\n$b = \\frac{\\sum y_i \\varepsilon_i}{\\sum y_i^2} = \\frac{(15)(640)+(-15)(-560)+(5)(240)+(-5)(-160)}{15^2 + (-15)^2 + 5^2 + (-5)^2}$\n$b = \\frac{9600 + 8400 + 1200 + 800}{225 + 225 + 25 + 25} = \\frac{20000}{500} = 40\\,\\mu\\varepsilon/\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThese are the exact coefficients we found previously. A calculation would show that the residuals are all zero, so the line passes through all points and $R^2=1$, which verifies linearity.\nThe neutral axis is then $y_{\\mathrm{NA}} = -a/b = -40/40 = -1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThis procedure is entirely correct, robust, and represents a standard scientific practice for data analysis. All claims and calculated values in the option are correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nBoth procedures A and D correctly verify linearity and locate the neutral axis. The question asks to select all that apply.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2880509"}]}
