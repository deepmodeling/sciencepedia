It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem statement that describes the canonical case of Euler buckling for a pin-supported column. It is a fundamental problem in mechanics of materials, and all provided data are consistent and physically realistic for a steel column. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins by considering the static equilibrium of the column in a slightly deflected configuration, described by the transverse displacement $w(x)$. An axial compressive force $P$ is applied at both ends. For a section of the column cut at an arbitrary position $x$ along its length, the internal bending moment $M(x)$ must balance the external moment produced by the axial force $P$ acting on the lever arm $w(x)$. By convention, a positive deflection $w(x)$ under a compressive force $P$ induces a negative internal bending moment. Thus, the equilibrium equation is:\n$$M(x) = -P w(x)$$\nThe problem provides the moment-curvature relationship from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory:\n$$M(x) = E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$$\nwhere $EI$ is the flexural rigidity of the column. Equating the two expressions for the bending moment yields the governing homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation for the transverse deflection:\n$$E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -P w(x)$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into standard form:\n$$\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} + \\frac{P}{EI} w(x) = 0$$\nLet us define a constant $\\alpha^2 = \\frac{P}{EI}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} + \\alpha^2 w(x) = 0$$\nThe general solution to this differential equation is:\n$$w(x) = C_1 \\sin(\\alpha x) + C_2 \\cos(\\alpha x)$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions. The column has pin supports at both ends, which means the deflection must be zero at these points.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$1$. At $x=0$, $w(0)=0$.\n$2$. At $x=L$, $w(L)=0$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$w(0) = C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0) = 0 + C_2(1) = C_2 = 0$$\nThis reduces the solution to $w(x) = C_1 \\sin(\\alpha x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$w(L) = C_1 \\sin(\\alpha L) = 0$$\nThis equation yields two possibilities. The first is $C_1=0$, which implies $w(x)=0$ for all $x$. This is the trivial solution, representing the unbuckled, straight state of the column. The second, non-trivial possibility, which describes the onset of buckling, requires that the sine term be zero while $C_1 \\neq 0$:\n$$\\sin(\\alpha L) = 0$$\nThis condition is satisfied when the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of $\\pi$:\n$$\\alpha L = n \\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThe case $n=0$ is excluded as it implies $P=0$ or leads back to the trivial solution.\nSubstituting back the definition of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{P/EI}$:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{P_n}{EI}} L = n \\pi$$\nSolving for the load $P_n$ gives the discrete set of critical loads, or eigenvalues, at which buckling can occur:\n$$P_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$$\nThe smallest critical load, $P_{cr}$, corresponds to the first buckling mode ($n=1$) and is the load at which instability first occurs:\n$$P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$$\nThe corresponding critical average axial stress is $\\sigma_{cr} = P_{cr}/A$:\n$$\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{A L^2}$$\nTo express this in terms of the slenderness ratio $\\lambda = L/k$, we use the definition of the radius of gyration, $k^2 = I/A$. Substituting $I/A = k^2$ into the stress equation gives:\n$$\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E k^2}{L^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{(L/k)^2}$$\nFinally, substituting $\\lambda = L/k$, we arrive at the required expression for the Euler critical stress:\n$$\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{\\lambda^2}$$\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the dimensionless ratio $R = \\sigma_{cr}/\\sigma_{y}$ using the provided data.

The total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of an axially compressed column is the sum of the internal strain energy of bending, $U$, and the potential of the external axial load, $V$.\n\nThe strain energy of bending, assuming an Euler-Bernoulli beam where the bending moment $M(x) = EI \\kappa(x)$, is given by:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} M(x) \\kappa(x) \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (\\kappa(x))^2 \\,dx\n$$\nUsing the provided kinematic relation for small deflections, the curvature is approximately $\\kappa(x) = w''(x)$, where $w(x)$ is the lateral deflection and primes denote differentiation with respect to $x$. The strain energy becomes:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (w''(x))^2 \\,dx\n$$\nThe potential of the external axial load $P$ is the negative of the work done by this force as the column shortens due to bending.
