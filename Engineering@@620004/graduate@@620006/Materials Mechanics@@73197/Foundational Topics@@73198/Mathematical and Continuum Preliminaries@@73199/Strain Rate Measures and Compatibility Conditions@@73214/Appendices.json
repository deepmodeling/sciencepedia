The use of polar coordinates and the concepts of strain, rotation, and compatibility are fundamental and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The displacement field is explicitly defined, making the problem of calculating derived quantities (strain, rotation) and checking conditions (compatibility) a well-posed mathematical exercise with a unique solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a valid problem in continuum mechanics. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires three sequential steps: calculation of strain components, kinematic analysis of the motion, and verification of the compatibility condition.\n\n**1. Calculation of Strain Components**\nThe components of the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, in polar coordinates are defined as follows:\n- Radial normal strain: $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r}$\n- Tangential (hoop) normal strain: $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{u_r}{r}$\n- Shear strain: $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_\\theta}{r} \\right)$\n\nThe given displacement field is $u_r = \\alpha r$ and $u_\\theta = \\beta r$. We must first compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\alpha r) = \\alpha$\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\alpha r) = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\beta r) = \\beta$\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\beta r) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the strain definitions yields:\n- $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\alpha$\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\frac{\\alpha r}{r} = \\alpha$\n- $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\beta - \\frac{\\beta r}{r} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\beta - \\beta) = 0$\n\nThe nonzero strain components are $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\alpha$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\alpha$. The shear strain $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}$ is identically zero.\n\n**2. Kinematic Analysis**\nThe motion is analyzed by decomposing the displacement gradient into its symmetric part (strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$) and its anti-symmetric part (rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$).\n\n- **Dilatation (Uniform Extension):** The planar dilatation is the trace of the strain tensor, $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{rr} + \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$.\n  In this case, the dilatation is $\\alpha + \\alpha = 2\\alpha$. Since the strain components are constant, this represents a uniform dilatation (or isotropic expansion/contraction) of the material. This component exists if $\\alpha \\neq 0$.\n\n- **Shear:** The shear deformation is characterized by the off-diagonal terms of the strain tensor. In the $(r,\\theta)$ basis, we found $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = 0$. Therefore, there is no shear deformation in this coordinate system.\n\n- **Rigid-Body Rotation:** The infinitesimal rotation of a material element is given by the rotation field $\\omega$, which is half the curl of the displacement field. In 2D, this is a scalar field. The formula for the component of the curl perpendicular to the plane is $(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u})_z = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r u_\\theta)}{\\partial r} - \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n  We compute the terms:\n  - $\\frac{\\partial(r u_\\theta)}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial(r \\cdot \\beta r)}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial(\\beta r^2)}{\\partial r} = 2\\beta r$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$\n  The rotation field is $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u})_z = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r}(2\\beta r) - 0 \\right) = \\beta$.\n  Since the rotation field $\\omega$ is a constant, $\\beta$, this corresponds to a uniform rigid-body rotation of rate $\\beta$. This component exists if $\\beta \\neq 0$.\n\nIn summary, the motion is a superposition of a uniform dilatation and a rigid-body rotation.\n\n**3. Compatibility Condition Verification**\nThe Saint-Venant compatibility conditions ensure that a strain field can be integrated to yield a single-valued, continuous displacement field. Since our strain field was derived from such a displacement field, it must be compatible. This serves as a consistency check.\nThe compatibility equation for plane problems in polar coordinates is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{\\theta \\theta}}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{2}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{\\theta \\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{rr}}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{r \\theta}}{\\partial r \\partial \\theta} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{r \\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) $$\nOur strain components are $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\alpha$, and $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = 0$. Since $\\alpha$ is a constant, all partial derivatives of $\\varepsilon_{rr}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$ are zero. All derivatives of $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}$ are also zero.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$ 0 + \\frac{2}{r}(0) - \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\frac{1}{r^2}(0) = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\frac{1}{r^2}(0) \\right) $$\n$$ 0 = 0 $$\nThe equation is satisfied identically. The strain field is compatible.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. $\\varepsilon_{rr}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}=0$; the motion is a superposition of a uniform dilatation and a rigid-body rotation of rate $\\beta$, with no shear; the strain field is compatible.**\n  - Strain components match our derivation: $\\varepsilon_{rr}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}=0$.\n  - Kinematic classification is correct: uniform dilatation from $\\alpha$, rigid-body rotation from $\\beta$, and no shear.\n  - Compatibility status is correct.\n  - Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. $\\varepsilon_{rr}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}=\\beta/2$; the motion exhibits radial extension and shear but no rigid rotation; the strain field is compatible only if $\\beta=0$.**\n  - Strain components are incorrect.
