The concept of a symmetric rank-$2$ tensor and the counting of its independent components are standard topics in linear algebra, tensor calculus, and their applications in physics and engineering, such as continuum mechanics. The definition of the strain tensor and its symmetry property are cornerstones of linearized elasticity theory.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a definite quantity (the number of independent components) based on clearly stated mathematical properties (rank-$2$ tensor, symmetry, dimension $n$). A unique and meaningful solution exists and is derivable from the premises.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, formal, and devoid of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed question in applied mathematics that admits a rigorous, unique solution. The analysis will now proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem is to determine the number of independent components of a symmetric rank-$2$ tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ in an $n$-dimensional space. Such a tensor can be represented by an $n \\times n$ matrix whose components are $\\varepsilon_{ij}$, where $i$ and $j$ are indices from $1$ to $n$.\n\nWithout any constraints, a rank-$2$ tensor in $n$ dimensions has components corresponding to every ordered pair of indices $(i,j)$. Since there are $n$ choices for the first index $i$ and $n$ choices for the second index $j$, the total number of components would be $n \\times n = n^{2}$.\n\nThe problem introduces the critical constraint of symmetry:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ji} $$\nThis equation establishes a dependency between components. Specifically, the component at position $(i,j)$ is not independent of the component at position $(j,i)$. Therefore, we cannot simply count all $n^2$ components. We must count only the number of components that can be chosen independently, from which all other components are determined by the symmetry relation.\n\nTo count these independent components systematically, we partition the set of all components $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ into two disjoint subsets:\n1. The **diagonal** components, where the indices are equal: $i = j$.\n2. The **off-diagonal** components, where the indices are not equal: $i \\neq j$.\n\nLet us count the number of independent components in each subset.\n\n**1. Diagonal Components:**\nThe diagonal components are of the form $\\varepsilon_{ii}$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. These components are $\\varepsilon_{11}, \\varepsilon_{22}, \\dots, \\varepsilon_{nn}$. The symmetry condition $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ji}$ provides no constraint on these components, as setting $j=i$ yields the tautology $\\varepsilon_{ii} = \\varepsilon_{ii}$. Thus, all diagonal components are independent of each other and of the off-diagonal components. The number of such components is precisely $n$.\n\n**2. Off-Diagonal Components:**\nThe off-diagonal components are of the form $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ where $i \\neq j$. The total number of components in the $n \\times n$ matrix is $n^{2}$. The number of diagonal components is $n$. Therefore, the total number of off-diagonal components is $n^{2} - n$.\nThe symmetry relation $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ji}$ directly links pairs of these off-diagonal components. For any pair of distinct indices $(i,j)$, the value of $\\varepsilon_{ji}$ is determined once $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is specified. This means that for every pair of components $(\\varepsilon_{ij}, \\varepsilon_{ji})$ with $i \\neq j$, only one can be chosen independently.\nThe set of all off-diagonal components is partitioned into such pairs. Therefore, the number of independent off-diagonal components is exactly half of the total number of off-diagonal components.\nNumber of independent off-diagonal components = $\\frac{n^{2} - n}{2}$.\n\n**Total Number of Independent Components:**\nThe total number of independent components, let us call it $N_{indep}$, is the sum of the number of independent diagonal components and the number of independent off-diagonal components.\n$$ N_{indep} = (\\text{Number of independent diagonal components}) + (\\text{Number of independent off-diagonal components}) $$\nSubstituting the counts derived above:\n$$ N_{indep} = n + \\frac{n^{2} - n}{2} $$\nTo obtain a simplified closed-form expression, we find a common denominator and combine the terms:\n$$ N_{indep} = \\frac{2n}{2} + \\frac{n^{2} - n}{2} = \\frac{2n + n^{2} - n}{2} = \\frac{n^{2} + n}{2} $$\nFactoring the numerator gives the final expression:\n$$ N_{indep} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$\nThis expression represents the number of independent scalar values needed to fully specify a symmetric rank-$2$ tensor in $n$ dimensions.

We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the execution of three distinct tasks, which will be addressed in sequence.\n\n1.  Construction of the rotation tensor $Q$.\n    A rigid rotation about the $z$-axis (the $x_3$-axis) by an angle $\\theta$ is represented in a Cartesian basis by the rotation matrix:\n    $$\n    Q(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\\n    \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The problem states that $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{3}{5}$.

Computation of the transformed tensor $T'$.\n    The components of a second-order tensor $T$ in a new basis, which is rotated with respect to the old basis by a transformation $Q$, are given by the rule $T' = Q T Q^T$. This rule is also equivalent to $Q T Q^{-1}$ because for an orthogonal tensor, its inverse is equal to its transpose ($Q^{-1} = Q^T$).

The calculation explicitly verifies that $\\operatorname{tr}(T) = \\operatorname{tr}(T')$ for this specific case.\n\n    This result is expected. In general, using the cyclic property of the trace, $\\operatorname{tr}(ABC) = \\operatorname{tr}(CAB)$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}(T') = \\operatorname{tr}(Q T Q^T) = \\operatorname{tr}((Q^T Q) T)\n    $$\n    Since $Q$ is orthogonal, $Q^T Q = I$, where $I$ is the identity tensor.\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}(T') = \\operatorname{tr}(I T) = \\operatorname{tr}(T)\n    $$\n    This demonstrates from first principles of tensor algebra that the trace is always invariant under an orthogonal transformation.\n\n    Finally, we evaluate the scalar $S$:\n    $$\n    S = \\operatorname{tr}(T') - \\operatorname{tr}(T) = 14 - 14 = 0\n    $$\n    The required scalar is zero, as a direct consequence of the invariance of the trace.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2922415"}, {"introduction": "Many engineering problems, particularly those involving cylindrical or spherical geometries, are most naturally analyzed in curvilinear coordinates.

Since $T^{r\\theta}=0$ and $T^{rz}=0$, this term simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial T^{rr}}{\\partial r}$.\n\n2. First Christoffel term: $\\Gamma^r_{lj} T^{lj}$. Since $T^{lj}$ is diagonal ($l=j$), the sum is $\\Gamma^r_{rr} T^{rr} + \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} T^{\\theta\\theta} + \\Gamma^r_{zz} T^{zz}$. From our list of Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^r_{rr}=0$, $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}=-r$, and $\\Gamma^r_{zz}=0$. The term thus becomes $-r T^{\\theta\\theta}$.\n\n3. Second Christoffel term: $\\Gamma^j_{lj} T^{rl}$. As $T^{rl}$ is non-zero only for $l=r$, this term becomes $\\Gamma^j_{rj} T^{rr}$. Summing over $j$: $(\\Gamma^r_{rr} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} + \\Gamma^z_{rz})T^{rr}$. Using the calculated symbols, we get $(0 + \\frac{1}{r} + 0)T^{rr} = \\frac{1}{r} T^{rr}$.\n\nCombining the three terms, we obtain the expression for the contravariant component $v^r$:\n$$ v^r = \\frac{\\partial T^{rr}}{\\partial r} - r T^{\\theta\\theta} + \\frac{1}{r} T^{rr} $$\nFinally, we substitute the physical components $T_{rr}$ and $T_{\\theta\\theta}$ back into this expression using the relations $T^{rr} = T_{rr}$ and $T^{\\theta\\theta} = T_{\\theta\\theta}/r^2$:\n$$ v^r = \\frac{\\partial T_{rr}}{\\partial r} - r \\left( \\frac{T_{\\theta\\theta}}{r^2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r} T_{rr} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$ v^r = \\frac{\\partial T_{rr}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{T_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} + \\frac{T_{rr}}{r} $$\n$$ v^r = \\frac{\\partial T_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{T_{rr} - T_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} $$\nSince the physical $r$-component $(\\operatorname{div}\\mathbf{T})^r$ is equal to the contravariant component $v^r$, this is our final result. This expression depends on $r$, the components $T_{rr}$ and $T_{\\theta\\theta}$, and the partial derivative of $T_{rr}$ with respect to $r$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial T_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{T_{rr} - T_{\\theta\\theta}}{r}}$$", "id": "2922406"}]}
