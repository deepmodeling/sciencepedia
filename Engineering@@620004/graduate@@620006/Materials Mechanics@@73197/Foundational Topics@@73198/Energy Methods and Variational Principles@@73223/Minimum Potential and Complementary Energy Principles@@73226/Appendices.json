The space of admissible variations is $V_0 = \\{ v \\in H^1(\\Omega; \\mathbb{R}^2) : v(x_0, y_0) = 0 \\}$.\n*   **Claim Analysis**: The option claims that a rigid rotation about $(x_0, y_0)$, given by $u(x,y) = \\omega (-(y-y_0), x-x_0)$ for a scalar $\\omega \\neq 0$, is in $V_0$ and causes loss of coercivity.\n    1.  This function represents an infinitesimal rigid body motion. As such, its strain tensor is zero, $\\varepsilon(u) = 0$, which correctly implies $a(u,u)=0$. For $\\omega \\neq 0$, the function $u$ is non-zero.\n    2.  We must check if this function satisfies the homogeneous boundary condition, i.e., if $u \\in V_0$. At the point $(x_0, y_0)$, the displacement is $u(x_0, y_0) = \\omega (-(y_0-y_0), x_0-x_0) = (0,0)$. The condition is satisfied.\n    3.  Therefore, $V_0$ contains a non-trivial rigid body motion. The conclusion that coercivity fails and the resulting stiffness matrix is singular is correct. The boundary conditions are insufficient to prevent a rigid body rotation about the fixed point.\n*   **Remedy Analysis**: The proposed remedy is to add a further independent displacement constraint, for instance $u_y=0$ at a different point $(x_1, y_1)$ where $x_1 \\neq x_0$. The rigid motion is $u(x,y) = \\omega (-(y-y_0), x-x_0)$. The new constraint would require its $y$-component to be zero at $(x_1, y_1)$: $\\omega(x_1-x_0) = 0$. Since $x_1 \\neq x_0$, this forces $\\omega=0$, thus eliminating the non-trivial rotational mode. Other remedies listed (posing on a quotient space, using Lagrange multipliers) are also standard and valid methods for handling such problems.\n*   **Verdict**: Option A provides a correct example of failing boundary conditions, a correct explanation for the failure, and a set of valid remedies. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\n\n*   **Scenario**: For a $2$D rectangular domain, the displacement $u$ is fixed to zero along the entire left edge, $\\Gamma_D$.\n*   **Claim Analysis**: The option claims a non-trivial rigid motion lies in $V_0 = \\{ v \\in H^1(\\Omega; \\mathbb{R}^2) : v = 0 \\text{ on } \\Gamma_D \\}$. A general rigid body motion in $2$D is given by $u(x,y) = (c_x - \\omega y, c_y + \\omega x)$. Let the left edge be defined by $x=x_L$ for $y \\in [y_{min}, y_{max}]$. The boundary condition $u=0$ on $\\Gamma_D$ implies:\n    1.  $u_x(x_L, y) = c_x - \\omega y = 0$ for all $y \\in [y_{min}, y_{max}]$. For this polynomial in $y$ to be zero on an interval, its coefficients must be zero. This requires $\\omega=0$ and $c_x=0$.\n    2.  $u_y(x_L, y) = c_y + \\omega x_L = 0$. With $\\omega=0$, this implies $c_y=0$.\n    The only rigid motion satisfying the condition is $c_x=0, c_y=0, \\omega=0$, which is the trivial motion $u=0$. Therefore, no non-trivial rigid motion lies in $V_0$. The claim is false. By Korn's inequality, since all rigid motions are suppressed, $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is coercive on $V_0$.\n*   **Remedy Analysis**: The statement \"None is needed because loads are self-equilibrated\" is irrelevant and incorrect. The well-posedness of the variational problem depends on the properties of $V_0$, not the loads. The problem with these boundary conditions is already well-posed.\n*   **Verdict**: The initial claim is false. The described boundary conditions are sufficient to ensure well-posedness. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\n\n*   **Scenario**: For a $1$D bar $\\Omega=(0,L)$, pure Neumann boundary conditions are applied. This means $\\Gamma_D$ is a an empty set, so $V_0 = H^1(0,L)$.\n*   **Claim Analysis**: The option claims that any constant displacement $u(x)=c$ for $c \\neq 0$ lies in $V_0$ and causes non-coercivity.\n    1.  The rigid body motion in $1$D is translation, $u(x)=c$. For any constant $c$, this function is in $H^1(0,L)$, so it is in $V_0$.\n    2.  The strain is $u'(x) = 0$. The strain energy is $a(u,u) = \\int_0^L AE(u')^2 dx = 0$.\n    3.  For any $c \\neq 0$, we have a non-zero function $u(x)=c$ in $V_0$ for which $a(u,u)=0$. This directly violates the condition for coercivity. The claim is correct. This problem corresponds to a floating bar, which has a translational rigid body mode.\n*   **Remedy Analysis**: The problem is the unconstrained translational mode.\n    -   Remedy 1: Fixing a displacement, e.g. $u(0)=0$. This modifies $V_0$ to $\\{v \\in H^1(0,L): v(0)=0\\}$. For a rigid motion $u(x)=c$ to be in this space, $u(0)=c=0$ is required. So only the trivial rigid motion remains. This is a valid remedy.\n    -   Remedy 2: Imposing a zero-mean constraint $\\int_0^L u \\, dx = 0$. For a rigid motion $u(x)=c$, this implies $\\int_0^L c \\, dx = cL = 0$. Since $L>0$, we must have $c=0$. This is also a valid remedy, typically enforced via a Lagrange multiplier.\n    -   Remedy 3: Working on the quotient space $H^1(0,L)/\\mathbb{R}$ is the mathematically formal way of stating that the solution is determined up to an arbitrary constant, which is correct.\n*   **Verdict**: Option C provides a correct example of failing boundary conditions, a correct explanation for the failure, and a set of valid remedies. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\n\n*   **Scenario**: For a $2$D circular disk $\\Omega$ centered at the origin, the boundary condition is a \"no-penetration\" or \"sliding\" condition, $u \\cdot n = 0$, on the entire boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. Here $n$ is the outward unit normal.\n*   **Claim Analysis**: The claim is that a pure rotation about the origin, $u(x) = \\omega W x$ where $W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, satisfies the homogeneous boundary condition and has zero strain energy.\n    1.  The function $u(x)$ is a rigid body motion, so $\\varepsilon(u)=0$ and $a(u,u)=0$. For $\\omega \\neq 0$, $u$ is non-zero.\n    2.  The space of admissible variations is $V_0 = \\{ v \\in H^1(\\Omega; \\mathbb{R}^2) : v \\cdot n = 0 \\text{ on } \\partial\\Omega \\}$. We check if $u(x)$ is in $V_0$. On the boundary circle, the normal vector is $n = x/\\|x\\|$. The condition becomes $u \\cdot n = (\\omega W x) \\cdot (x/\\|x\\|) = (\\omega/\\|x\\|) (Wx \\cdot x)$. The dot product is $Wx \\cdot x = (-y, x) \\cdot (x ,y) = -yx + xy = 0$. So the condition $u \\cdot n = 0$ is satisfied.\n    3.  A non-trivial rigid motion (rotation) belongs to $V_0$. The conclusion that coercivity fails is correct. The boundary condition prevents radial displacement at the boundary but allows rotation of the entire disk.\n*   **Remedy Analysis**: The problem is the unconstrained rotational mode. The remedies must eliminate this mode.\n    -   Remedy 1: \"Anchor the tangential direction at one boundary point, for example also impose $u \\cdot t = 0$ at a single point\". The tangential component of the rigid rotation $u(x)=\\omega(-y,x)$ is non-zero (its magnitude is $\\omega R$). Forcing it to be zero at a single point forces $\\omega=0$, which is a valid remedy.\n    -   Remedy 2: \"fix $u=0$ at one boundary point\". If $u=0$ at a point $p \\in \\partial\\Omega$, then for the rigid rotation, we need $\\omega W p = 0$. Since $p\\neq 0$ and $W$ is an invertible matrix, this forces $\\omega = 0$. This is also a valid remedy.\n    -   The other abstract remedies (Lagrange multiplier, quotient space) are also conceptually valid.\n*   **Verdict**: Option D provides a correct example of failing boundary conditions, a correct explanation for the failure, and a set of valid remedies. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, options A, C, and D correctly describe scenarios where the minimum potential energy principle is ill-posed due to the presence of rigid body modes in the space of admissible variations and provide appropriate remedies. Option B is incorrect as the boundary conditions described are sufficient to eliminate all rigid body modes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2577345"}]}
