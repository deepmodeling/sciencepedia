The linear elastic constitutive relation (Hooke's Law).\n3.  The definition of elastic strain energy.\n\nStep 1: Axial Equilibrium\nConsider a free-body diagram of a segment of the bar from an arbitrary position $x$ to the end at $x=L$. The bar is subjected to an external tensile force $P$ at $x=L$. As per the problem statement, there are no body forces acting on the bar. For the segment to be in static equilibrium, the internal axial force $N(x)$ at the cross-section at position $x$ must balance the external force $P$.\n$$N(x) - P = 0$$\nTherefore, the internal axial force is constant along the length of the bar:\n$$N(x) = P$$\n\nStep 2: Stress and Strain Fields\nThe axial stress $\\sigma(x)$ is defined as the internal force per unit area. Since the cross-sectional area $A(x)$ varies with position, the stress will also be a function of $x$.\n$$\\sigma(x) = \\frac{N(x)}{A(x)} = \\frac{P}{A(x)}$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $A(x) = A_{0}(1 + a \\frac{x}{L})$:\n$$\\sigma(x) = \\frac{P}{A_{0}\\left(1 + a \\frac{x}{L}\\right)}$$\nThe problem states that the material is linearly elastic. The constitutive relation is given by Hooke's Law, $\\sigma(x) = E(x)\\epsilon(x)$, where $\\epsilon(x)$ is the axial strain and $E(x)$ is the spatially varying Young's modulus.\nThe axial strain is therefore:\n$$\\epsilon(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)}{E(x)} = \\frac{P}{A(x)E(x)}$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for $A(x)$ and $E(x) = E_{0}(1 + b \\frac{x}{L})$:\n$$\\epsilon(x) = \\frac{P}{A_{0}\\left(1 + a \\frac{x}{L}\\right) E_{0}\\left(1 + b \\frac{x}{L}\\right)}$$\n\nStep 3: Elastic Strain Energy\nThe elastic strain energy density, $u(x)$, which is the strain energy per unit volume, for a linearly elastic material is given by:\n$$u(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(x)\\epsilon(x)$$\nThe total elastic strain energy $U$ stored in the bar is the integral of the strain energy density over the total volume $V$ of the bar.

It is a well-posed problem in linear elastic structural analysis. The provided data are scientifically consistent. The request is to derive a reciprocity relation from first principles of energy and use it to find a displacement. The presence of data such as bending stiffness $E I$ and specific load locations $a$ and $b$ which are not ultimately required for the numerical calculation is a common method to test fundamental understanding, compelling the student to recognize the a-priori applicability of the reciprocity theorem, rather than resorting to brute-force calculation.\n\nWe begin from the first principles of complementary energy for a linear elastic system. For such a system subjected to a set of point loads $P_i$, the complementary energy $\\Pi^*$ is a state function of these loads. The displacement $\\Delta_j$ at the point of application of a load $P_j$ and in the direction of $P_j$ is given by the Crotti-Engesser theorem:\n$$ \\Delta_j = \\frac{\\partial \\Pi^*}{\\partial P_j} $$\nFor a slender beam where bending is the dominant mode of deformation, the complementary energy is stored as bending strain energy and is calculated by integrating the complementary energy density over the volume of the beam. This results in the expression:\n$$ \\Pi^* = \\int_0^L \\frac{M(x)^2}{2 EI} dx $$\nwhere $M(x)$ is the bending moment at position $x$, $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section, and $L$ is the length of the beam.\n\nLet us consider a general loading scenario where two independent vertical point loads, $P_a$ and $P_b$, are applied at locations $x=a$ and $x=b$, respectively. Due to the principle of superposition for a linear elastic system, the total bending moment $M(x)$ at any point $x$ along the beam is the sum of the moments caused by each load acting separately. We can write this as:\n$$ M(x; P_a, P_b) = M_a(x) + M_b(x) $$\nwhere $M_a(x)$ is the moment due to $P_a$ and $M_b(x)$ is the moment due to $P_b$. These moments are linearly proportional to the loads that cause them. Thus, we can define influence functions for the bending moment, $m_a(x)$ and $m_b(x)$, such that:\n$$ M_a(x) = P_a m_a(x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_b(x) = P_b m_b(x) $$\nwhere $m_a(x)$ is the bending moment due to a unit load at $x=a$, and $m_b(x)$ is the bending moment due to a unit load at $x=b$.\n\nThe total complementary energy of the system as a function of the two loads is:\n$$ \\Pi^*(P_a, P_b) = \\int_0^L \\frac{[P_a m_a(x) + P_b m_b(x)]^2}{2 EI} dx $$\n$$ \\Pi^*(P_a, P_b) = \\frac{1}{2 EI} \\int_0^L [P_a^2 m_a(x)^2 + 2 P_a P_b m_a(x) m_b(x) + P_b^2 m_b(x)^2] dx $$\nThe vertical displacement at $x=a$, denoted $\\Delta_a$, is found by taking the partial derivative of $\\Pi^*$ with respect to $P_a$:\n$$ \\Delta_a(P_a, P_b) = \\frac{\\partial \\Pi^*}{\\partial P_a} = \\frac{1}{EI} \\int_0^L [P_a m_a(x)^2 + P_b m_a(x) m_b(x)] dx $$\nSimilarly, the vertical displacement at $x=b$, denoted $\\Delta_b$, is:\n$$ \\Delta_b(P_a, P_b) = \\frac{\\partial \\Pi^*}{\\partial P_b} = \\frac{1}{EI} \\int_0^L [P_a m_a(x) m_b(x) + P_b m_b(x)^2] dx $$\nSince $\\Pi^*$ is a continuous state function with continuous second derivatives, the order of differentiation does not matter (Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials).

For a linear system, the displacement at $a$ due to only a load $P_b$ is $\\Delta_{a|P_b} = f_{ab} P_b$. Thus, $f_{ab} = \\Delta_{a|P_b} / P_b$.\nSimilarly, $\\frac{\\partial \\Delta_b}{\\partial P_a} = f_{ba}$, and $\\Delta_{b|P_a} = f_{ba} P_a$, so $f_{ba} = \\Delta_{b|P_a} / P_a$.\nThe equality $f_{ab} = f_{ba}$ implies:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta_{a|P_b}}{P_b} = \\frac{\\Delta_{b|P_a}}{P_a} \\implies P_a \\Delta_{a|P_b} = P_b \\Delta_{b|P_a} $$\nThis is Maxwell's reciprocal theorem, which we have derived from the first principles of complementary energy.

The skew-symmetric part of the tangent operator encapsulates the absence of a scalar energy potential for the follower action; only the symmetric elastic part $K_{s}$ contributes to the elastic strain energy $U(u) = \\tfrac{1}{2} u^{\\mathsf{T}} K_{s} u$, and complementary energy based on the full operator is not defined. Consequently, Maxwell–Betti reciprocity does not apply to the full system, as evidenced by the computed $\\Delta \\neq 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{320.5}$$", "id": "2881883"}]}
