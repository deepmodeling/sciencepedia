The core of the circuit is a common-emitter configuration using an NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), which will be operated as a simple switch. To ensure reliable switching and to protect the BJT, the engineer must define the DC load line. The two key operating points on this load line are cutoff and saturation.\n\nIn the cutoff state, the transistor behaves like an open switch. The design requires the collector-emitter voltage at cutoff, $V_{CE(off)}$, to be exactly $15.0$ V.\n\nIn the saturation state, the transistor behaves like a closed switch. The collector current reaches its maximum possible value, the saturation current $I_{C(sat)}$. For this specific application, the required saturation current is $I_{C(sat)} = 5.00$ mA. In an ideal analysis of the saturation condition, the collector-emitter voltage is considered to be zero.\n\nBased on these ideal design specifications, determine the required DC supply voltage, $V_{CC}$, and the total equivalent resistance, $R_L$, in the collector-emitter loop.
