The fault consists of the base resistor $R_B$ being shorted, which connects the base terminal directly to the supply voltage $V_{CC}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the condition at the base-emitter junction due to the fault. With the base connected directly to $V_{CC}$, the voltage at the base is $V_B = V_{CC} = 15.0 \\text{ V}$. The emitter is grounded, so its voltage is $V_E = 0 \\text{ V}$. The voltage across the base-emitter junction is therefore:\n$$V_{BE} = V_B - V_E = 15.0 \\text{ V} - 0 \\text{ V} = 15.0 \\text{ V}$$\n\nA silicon BJT's base-emitter junction behaves like a diode. In the forward-active region, this voltage drop is typically around $V_{BE,on} = 0.70 \\text{ V}$. The calculated $V_{BE}$ of $15.0 \\text{ V}$ is far greater than this typical turn-on voltage. Such a large forward-bias voltage would attempt to drive an extremely large base current, limited only by the very small internal resistance of the junction. This large base current is more than sufficient to push the transistor out of the active region and deep into the saturation region. In a real-world scenario, this would likely destroy the transistor, but for the purpose of circuit analysis, we assume it operates in saturation.\n\nWhen a BJT is in saturation, two key conditions apply:\n1. The collector-emitter voltage collapses to its minimum value, the saturation voltage $V_{CE,sat}$.\n2. The collector current $I_C$ is no longer determined by the base current via the relation $I_C = \\beta I_B$. Instead, $I_C$ is limited by the external components in the collector-emitter loop.\n\nUsing the first condition, we can immediately determine the quiescent collector-emitter voltage $V_{CEQ}$.\n$$V_{CEQ} = V_{CE,sat}$$\nFrom the problem statement, $V_{CE,sat} = 0.20 \\text{ V}$.
