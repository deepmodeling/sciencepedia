In the emitter-stabilized bias circuit, the collector voltage is determined by the supply voltage $V_{CC}$, the collector resistor $R_C$, and the collector current $I_C$. The relationship is given by Kirchhoff's Voltage Law:\n$$V_{C} = V_{CC} - I_{C} R_{C}$$\nThe observation is that $V_C = V_{CC}$. For this to be true, the term $I_C R_C$ must be equal to zero. Since $R_C$ is a physical resistor with a non-zero resistance (unless it is short-circuited), this condition implies that the collector current $I_C$ must be zero. The transistor is in the cutoff region.\n\nNow let's evaluate each potential fault to see which one would cause $I_C = 0$.\n\nA. If $R_E$ is short-circuited ($R_E=0$), the negative feedback is removed. This would cause the base current $I_B$ and collector current $I_C$ to *increase*, likely driving the transistor toward saturation. This would make $V_C$ *decrease*, not equal $V_{CC}$. So, this is incorrect.\n\nB. If $R_B$ is short-circuited ($R_B=0$), a very large base current would flow, limited only by $R_E$ and the base-emitter junction. This would cause a very large collector current, driving the transistor deep into saturation. $V_C$ would be very low (close to $V_E$). So, this is incorrect.\n\nC. If $R_C$ is short-circuited ($R_C=0$), the collector terminal would be directly connected to the supply voltage $V_{CC}$. In this case, measuring the voltage at the collector would indeed yield $V_C = V_{CC}$, regardless of the collector current. This is a possible cause.\n\nD. If $\\beta$ is significantly lower than expected, $I_C$ would be lower than the design value. This would cause $V_C$ to be higher than expected and closer to $V_{CC}$, but it would not be exactly equal to $V_{CC}$ unless $\\beta$ was exactly zero. This is less likely than a component failure.\n\nE. If $R_B$ is an open circuit, there is no path for bias current to flow from $V_{CC}$ to the base of the transistor. Therefore, the base current $I_B$ will be zero. Since $I_C = \\beta I_B$, the collector current $I_C$ will also be zero. With $I_C=0$, the voltage drop across $R_C$ is zero, and the collector voltage becomes $V_C = V_{CC} - (0 \\cdot R_C) = V_{CC}$. This perfectly explains the observation.\n\nComparing C and E: Both faults can result in a reading of $V_C = V_{CC}$. However, a short-circuited $R_C$ would likely cause the transistor to draw excessive current through the collector-emitter path, potentially damaging it. An open-circuited $R_B$ simply cuts the transistor off, which is a \"cleaner\" fault that directly results in $I_C=0$ without other side effects. In many common troubleshooting scenarios, an open base resistor is the most direct and plausible explanation for a cutoff transistor with no collector current.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is that the base resistor has failed open.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1302029"}]}
