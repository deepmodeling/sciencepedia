For this configuration, the input signal voltage $v_{in}$ is applied to the gate, and the output signal voltage $v_{out}$ is taken from the drain.\n\nTo improve the amplifier's linearity and stabilize its gain, the designer modifies the circuit to create Configuration B.

We will use the small-signal model for the MOSFET operating in saturation. Since the channel-length modulation is neglected ($r_o \\to \\infty$), the model consists of a voltage-controlled current source of value $g_m v_{gs}$ connected between the drain and source terminals, where $v_{gs}$ is the small-signal voltage between the gate and source. The gate terminal is an open circuit in this model.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Configuration A (without source resistor $R_S$)**\nIn Configuration A, the source terminal is connected to ground. The small-signal input voltage $v_{in}$ is applied to the gate. Therefore, the gate-to-source voltage is $v_{gs} = v_g - v_s = v_{in} - 0 = v_{in}$.\nThe controlled current source produces a current $i_d = g_m v_{gs} = g_m v_{in}$ flowing from drain to source. This current flows out of the drain node and through the drain resistor $R_D$, which is connected between the output node (drain) and the AC ground (the DC supply voltage).\nThe output voltage $v_{out}$ is the voltage at the drain node, which is given by Ohm's law:\n$$v_{out} = -i_d R_D = -(g_m v_{in}) R_D$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the current $i_d$ flows out of the node, causing a voltage drop across $R_D$. The voltage gain for Configuration A, $A_{v,A}$, is:\n$$A_{v,A} = \\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = -g_m R_D$$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Configuration B (with source resistor $R_S$)**\nIn Configuration B, the source resistor $R_S$ is added. The input voltage $v_{in}$ is still applied to the gate ($v_g = v_{in}$). The source is no longer at ground; its voltage is $v_s$. The gate-to-source voltage is now:\n$$v_{gs} = v_g - v_s = v_{in} - v_s$$\nThe drain current is still given by $i_d = g_m v_{gs}$. This same current must flow out of the source terminal and through the source resistor $R_S$. So, the voltage at the source is:\n$$v_s = i_d R_S = (g_m v_{gs}) R_S$$\nWe now have a system of two equations for $v_{gs}$ and $v_s$. We can substitute the second equation into the first:\n$$v_{gs} = v_{in} - (g_m v_{gs}) R_S$$\nNow, we solve for $v_{gs}$ in terms of $v_{in}$:\n$$v_{gs} + g_m v_{gs} R_S = v_{in}$$\n$$v_{gs}(1 + g_m R_S) = v_{in}$$\n$$v_{gs} = \\frac{v_{in}}{1 + g_m R_S}$$\nThe output voltage is determined by the drain current flowing through the drain resistor, just as in Configuration A:\n$$v_{out} = -i_d R_D = -(g_m v_{gs}) R_D$$\nSubstitute the expression for $v_{gs}$ into the equation for $v_{out}$:\n$$v_{out} = -g_m \\left( \\frac{v_{in}}{1 + g_m R_S} \\right) R_D$$\nThe voltage gain for Configuration B, $A_{v,B}$, is:\n$$A_{v,B} = \\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = -\\frac{g_m R_D}{1 + g_m R_S}$$\n\n**Step 3: Apply the condition and solve for $R_S$**\nThe problem states that the magnitude of the gain of Configuration B is half the magnitude of the gain of Configuration A:\n$$|A_{v,B}| = \\frac{1}{2} |A_{v,A}|$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for the gains:\n$$\\left| -\\frac{g_m R_D}{1 + g_m R_S} \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -g_m R_D \\right|$$\nSince $g_m$, $R_D$, and $R_S$ are positive physical quantities, the expressions inside the absolute value signs are well-defined.\n$$\\frac{g_m R_D}{1 + g_m R_S} = \\frac{g_m R_D}{2}$$\nWe can cancel the term $g_m R_D$ from both sides (as long as $g_m R_D \\neq 0$, which is true for a functional amplifier):\n$$\\frac{1}{1 + g_m R_S} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n$$1 + g_m R_S = 2$$\nSolving for $R_S$:\n$$g_m R_S = 1$$\n$$R_S = \\frac{1}{g_m}$$\nThis is the value of the source resistor required to reduce the gain magnitude by half.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{g_m}}$$", "id": "1294905"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a source resistor reduces gain, we can now explore a technique to reclaim it for AC signals while maintaining DC stability.
