This practice delves into small-signal analysis to derive the output resistance ($R_{out}$), one of the most important performance metrics for this amplifier topology. By including practical considerations such as the transistor's own output resistance ($r_o$) and the body effect ($g_{mb}$), you will develop a more realistic and complete model for the source follower's buffering capability [@problem_id:1291880].", "problem": "A source follower, also known as a common-drain amplifier, is constructed using an n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET), denoted as $M_1$. The drain of $M_1$ is connected to the positive power supply $V_{DD}$, its gate serves as the input voltage, and its source serves as the output voltage. The transistor $M_1$ is characterized by its small-signal transconductance $g_{m1}$, its intrinsic output resistance $r_{o1}$, and its body-effect transconductance $g_{mb1}$.\n\nThe amplifier is loaded by a non-ideal active load, which is implemented with another transistor configured as a current source. This active load exhibits a finite small-signal output resistance of $r_{o2}$. The main transistor $M_1$ and the active load are the only components connected to the output node.\n\nAssuming the body of $M_1$ is tied to the circuit's ground reference, and for the purpose of small-signal analysis the power supply $V_{DD}$ is also at AC ground, derive an expression for the output resistance, $R_{out}$, of the amplifier. Your answer should be a single closed-form expression in terms of $g_{m1}$, $g_{mb1}$, $r_{o1}$, and $r_{o2}$.", "solution": "To determine the output resistance $R_{out}$ of the source follower, we use the standard test-source method. We set all independent AC sources to zero, apply a test voltage $v_x$ to the output node, and calculate the resulting current $i_x$ drawn from the test source. The output resistance is then given by $R_{out} = v_x / i_x$.\n\nFirst, we establish the small-signal conditions. The output node is the source of transistor $M_1$, so its voltage is $v_s = v_x$. The input voltage to the amplifier is set to zero, so the gate voltage of $M_1$ is $v_g = 0$. The drain of $M_1$ is connected to the power supply $V_{DD}$, which is an AC ground, so $v_d = 0$. The body of $M_1$ is also connected to ground, so $v_b = 0$.\n\nFrom these terminal voltages, we can determine the controlling voltages for the small-signal model of $M_1$:\nThe gate-source voltage is $v_{gs1} = v_g - v_s = 0 - v_x = -v_x$.\nThe body-source voltage is $v_{bs1} = v_b - v_s = 0 - v_x = -v_x$.\n\nNext, we apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the output node. The total current $i_x$ supplied by the test source must be equal to the sum of the currents flowing away from the node into the connected components. The components connected to the output node are the load resistance $r_{o2}$ and the source terminal of the transistor $M_1$.\n\nSo, we can write the KCL equation as:\n$$i_x = i_{r_{o2}} + i_{s1}$$\nwhere $i_{r_{o2}}$ is the current flowing through the load resistance $r_{o2}$ to ground, and $i_{s1}$ is the current flowing into the source terminal of $M_1$.\n\nThe current through the load resistance $r_{o2}$ is given by Ohm's law:\n$$i_{r_{o2}} = \\frac{v_x}{r_{o2}}$$\n\nTo find the current $i_{s1}$ flowing into the source of $M_1$, we analyze the currents within the transistor's small-signal model. The model consists of the intrinsic output resistance $r_{o1}$ in parallel with two dependent current sources, $g_{m1}v_{gs1}$ and $g_{mb1}v_{bs1}$, both directed from the drain to the source. The total current flowing into the source terminal, $i_{s1}$, is the sum of currents leaving the node and entering the transistor's constituent parts.\n\n1.  **Current through $r_{o1}$**: This resistance is connected between the source (at $v_x$) and the drain (at $0$ V). The current flowing from the source node through $r_{o1}$ towards the drain is $\\frac{v_s - v_d}{r_{o1}} = \\frac{v_x - 0}{r_{o1}} = \\frac{v_x}{r_{o1}}$.\n\n2.  **Current from the $g_{m1}v_{gs1}$ source**: This source pushes a current of value $g_{m1}v_{gs1}$ from drain to source. Since $v_{gs1} = -v_x$, the current is $-g_{m1}v_x$. This negative value indicates that the current actually flows from source to drain. Thus, a current of magnitude $g_{m1}v_x$ leaves the source node.\n\n3.  **Current from the $g_{mb1}v_{bs1}$ source**: Similarly, this source pushes a current of value $g_{mb1}v_{bs1}$ from drain to source. Since $v_{bs1} = -v_x$, the current is $-g_{mb1}v_x$. This also corresponds to a current of magnitude $g_{mb1}v_x$ leaving the source node.\n\nThe total current $i_{s1}$ flowing away from the output node and into the source of $M_1$ is the sum of these three components:\n$$i_{s1} = \\frac{v_x}{r_{o1}} + g_{m1}v_x + g_{mb1}v_x$$\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $i_{r_{o2}}$ and $i_{s1}$ back into the KCL equation:\n$$i_x = \\frac{v_x}{r_{o2}} + \\left( \\frac{v_x}{r_{o1}} + g_{m1}v_x + g_{mb1}v_x \\right)$$\n\nWe can factor out $v_x$ from the right-hand side:\n$$i_x = v_x \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{o2}} + \\frac{1}{r_{o1}} + g_{m1} + g_{mb1} \\right)$$\n\nFinally, the output resistance $R_{out}$ is the ratio of $v_x$ to $i_x$:\n$$R_{out} = \\frac{v_x}{i_x} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{r_{o1}} + \\frac{1}{r_{o2}} + g_{m1} + g_{mb1}}$$\n\nThis expression shows that the output resistance is the parallel combination of $r_{o1}$, $r_{o2}$, and the resistances corresponding to the transconductances, $1/g_{m1}$ and $1/g_{mb1}$. To write this as a single fraction, we find a common denominator:\n$$R_{out} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{r_{o2} + r_{o1} + (g_{m1} + g_{mb1})r_{o1}r_{o2}}{r_{o1}r_{o2}}}$$\n\nInverting this gives the final expression:\n$$R_{out} = \\frac{r_{o1}r_{o2}}{r_{o1} + r_{o2} + (g_{m1} + g_{mb1})r_{o1}r_{o2}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r_{o1}r_{o2}}{r_{o1} + r_{o2} + (g_{m1} + g_{mb1})r_{o1}r_{o2}}}$$", "id": "1291880"}]}
