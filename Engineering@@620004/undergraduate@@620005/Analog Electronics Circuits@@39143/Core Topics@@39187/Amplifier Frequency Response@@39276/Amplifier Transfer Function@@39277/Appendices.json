The Miller effect is a critical phenomenon where a small capacitance between the input and output of an inverting amplifier appears as a much larger capacitance at the input, significantly limiting its high-frequency performance. This exercise uses Miller's theorem to derive this equivalent input capacitance, providing a direct link between a transistor's physical parameters and the amplifier's overall bandwidth limitations.", "problem": "A design engineer is analyzing the high-frequency performance of a single-stage common-emitter amplifier. For AC analysis, the Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is characterized by its small-signal hybrid-$\\pi$ model parameters: a transconductance $g_m$, an input resistance between the base and emitter $r_\\pi$, and an output resistance $r_o$. The amplifier circuit has a collector load resistor $R_C$ connected between the collector terminal and the DC power supply, and the emitter is connected directly to ground.\n\nIn a more refined high-frequency model, two parasitic capacitances must be considered: the base-emitter capacitance, $C_\\pi$, and the base-collector capacitance, $C_\\mu$. The capacitance $C_\\mu$ connects the input node (base) and output node (collector) of the amplifying stage, leading to a phenomenon known as the Miller effect.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the total equivalent input capacitance, $C_{in}$, as seen looking into the base of the transistor.

This capacitance is composed of two parts: the intrinsic base-emitter capacitance, $C_\\pi$, and the Miller capacitance, $C_M$, which arises from the base-collector capacitance, $C_\\mu$.\n$$C_{in} = C_\\pi + C_M$$\nTo find the Miller capacitance, we use Miller's theorem. The theorem states that an impedance $Z_f$ connected between two nodes, Node 1 (input) and Node 2 (output), where the voltage gain is $K = V_2/V_1$, can be replaced by an equivalent impedance to ground at the input, $Z_{in, M} = \\frac{Z_f}{1-K}$.\n\nIn our case, the impedance is the capacitor $C_\\mu$, so $Z_f = \\frac{1}{sC_\\mu}$. Node 1 is the base of the BJT, and Node 2 is the collector. We first need to calculate the small-signal voltage gain $K$ from the base to the collector.\n\nLet $v_b$ be the small-signal voltage at the base and $v_c$ be the small-signal voltage at the collector. The input resistance $r_\\pi$ is connected between the base and emitter (ground), so the voltage across it is $v_{be} = v_b$. The transconductance-controlled current source in the hybrid-$\\pi$ model generates a current $i_c = g_m v_{be} = g_m v_b$ flowing from the collector towards the emitter.\n\nThe collector voltage $v_c$ is determined by this current flowing into the parallel combination of the transistor's output resistance $r_o$ and the collector load resistor $R_C$. The total equivalent resistance at the collector node is $R_{L,eq} = r_o || R_C = \\frac{r_o R_C}{r_o + R_C}$.\nThe collector voltage is given by Ohm's law, with a negative sign because the current source $g_m v_b$ flows out of the node, thus:\n$$v_c = - (g_m v_b) R_{L,eq}$$\nThe voltage gain $K$ from base to collector is therefore:\n$$K = \\frac{v_c}{v_b} = -g_m R_{L,eq} = -g_m \\frac{r_o R_C}{r_o + R_C}$$\n\nNow we can apply Miller's theorem to find the equivalent input impedance due to $C_\\mu$:\n$$Z_{in, M} = \\frac{Z_f}{1-K} = \\frac{1/(sC_\\mu)}{1 - \\left(-g_m \\frac{r_o R_C}{r_o + R_C}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{sC_\\mu \\left(1 + g_m \\frac{r_o R_C}{r_o + R_C}\\right)}$$\nThis impedance is of the form $Z = 1/(sC)$, which is the impedance of a capacitor.
