This dependence is modeled by extrapolating the $I_C$ vs $V_{CE}$ characteristic curves, which approximately intersect at a single point on the negative voltage axis, at $V_{CE} = -V_A$.\n\nThe output resistance $r_o$ is defined as the inverse of the slope of the $I_C$ vs $V_{CE}$ curve at a specific operating point (Q-point). Mathematically, this is:\n$$\nr_o = \\left( \\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{CE}} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nIn the simplified first-order model of the Early effect, the collector current is given by:\n$$\nI_C = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_A}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming a constant base-emitter voltage $V_{BE}$, we can find the partial derivative of $I_C$ with respect to $V_{CE}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{CE}} = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\frac{1}{V_A}\n$$\nThe term $I_S \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$ represents the collector current if there were no Early effect.
