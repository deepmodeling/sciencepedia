To find this, we must first perform a DC analysis to find the quiescent operating point (Q-point), and then perform an AC analysis to determine the AC load line and the signal swing limits.\n\n**Step 1: DC Analysis to find the Q-point**\n\nThe Q-point is defined by the quiescent collector current, $I_{CQ}$, and the quiescent collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CEQ}$. For the DC analysis, all capacitors are treated as open circuits, so the load resistor $R_L$ is disconnected from the circuit.\n\nFirst, we find the quiescent base current, $I_{BQ}$. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the base-emitter loop:\n$$V_{CC} = I_{BQ} R_B + V_{BE}$$\nSolving for $I_{BQ}$:\n$$I_{BQ} = \\frac{V_{CC} - V_{BE}}{R_B}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$I_{BQ} = \\frac{12 \\text{ V} - 0.7 \\text{ V}}{560 \\times 10^3 \\, \\Omega} = \\frac{11.3 \\text{ V}}{560 \\times 10^3 \\, \\Omega} \\approx 2.01786 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{A} = 20.1786 \\, \\mu\\text{A}$$\nNext, we find the quiescent collector current, $I_{CQ}$, using the BJT's current gain $\\beta$:\n$$I_{CQ} = \\beta I_{BQ}$$\n$$I_{CQ} = 100 \\times (2.01786 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{A}) = 2.01786 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{A} = 2.01786 \\text{ mA}$$\nNow, we find the quiescent collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CEQ}$. Applying KVL to the collector-emitter loop (the DC load line equation):\n$$V_{CC} = I_{CQ} R_C + V_{CEQ}$$\nSolving for $V_{CEQ}$:\n$$V_{CEQ} = V_{CC} - I_{CQ} R_C$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$V_{CEQ} = 12 \\text{ V} - (2.01786 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{A}) \\times (3.3 \\times 10^3 \\, \\Omega) = 12 \\text{ V} - 6.659 \\text{ V} \\approx 5.341 \\text{ V}$$\nSo, the Q-point is $(V_{CEQ}, I_{CQ}) \\approx (5.341 \\text{ V}, 2.018 \\text{ mA})$.\n\n**Step 2: AC Analysis to find the swing limits**\n\nFor the AC analysis, the DC voltage source $V_{CC}$ is treated as an AC ground, and the coupling capacitor is treated as a short circuit. This means the load resistor $R_L$ is in parallel with the collector resistor $R_C$ from the perspective of the AC signal.\n\nThe total AC resistance in the collector circuit, $r_{ac}$, is the parallel combination of $R_C$ and $R_L$:\n$$r_{ac} = R_C || R_L = \\frac{R_C R_L}{R_C + R_L}$$\nSince the problem states $R_L = R_C$:\n$$r_{ac} = \\frac{R_C \\cdot R_C}{R_C + R_C} = \\frac{R_C^2}{2R_C} = \\frac{R_C}{2}$$\n$$r_{ac} = \\frac{3.3 \\text{ k}\\Omega}{2} = 1.65 \\text{ k}\\Omega$$\nThe AC load line is centered on the Q-point $(V_{CEQ}, I_{CQ})$ and has a slope of $-1/r_{ac}$.
