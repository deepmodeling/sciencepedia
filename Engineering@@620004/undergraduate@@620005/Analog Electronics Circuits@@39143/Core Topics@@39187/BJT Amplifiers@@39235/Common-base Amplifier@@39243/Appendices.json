This value is limited by the transistor either entering cutoff or saturation. The maximum symmetrical peak voltage swing is determined by the smaller of the maximum positive swing (limited by cutoff) and the maximum negative swing (limited by saturation). The peak-to-peak voltage is twice this value.\n\nFirst, we must perform a DC analysis to find the quiescent operating point (Q-point) of the transistor. The Q-point is defined by the DC collector current, $I_{CQ}$, and the DC collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CEQ}$.\n\nThe base biasing circuit, composed of $R_1$ and $R_2$, can be simplified using its Thevenin equivalent.

Substituting this into the KVL equation gives:\n$$V_{TH} = \\frac{I_E}{\\beta+1} R_{TH} + V_{BE,on} + I_E R_E$$\nNow we can solve for the quiescent emitter current, $I_{EQ}$:\n$$I_{EQ} = \\frac{V_{TH} - V_{BE,on}}{R_E + \\frac{R_{TH}}{\\beta+1}} = \\frac{2.2603 \\text{ V} - 0.7 \\text{ V}}{750 \\Omega + \\frac{9342.5 \\Omega}{100+1}} = \\frac{1.5603 \\text{ V}}{750 \\Omega + 92.5 \\Omega} = \\frac{1.5603 \\text{ V}}{842.5 \\Omega} = 1.8520 \\text{ mA}$$\n\nThe quiescent collector current, $I_{CQ}$, is related to $I_{EQ}$ by $\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}$:\n$$I_{CQ} = \\alpha I_{EQ} = \\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right) \\times 1.8520 \\text{ mA} = 1.8337 \\text{ mA}$$\n\nNow we can determine the quiescent DC voltages at the emitter ($V_E$) and collector ($V_C$):\n$$V_{EQ} = I_{EQ} R_E = 1.8520 \\text{ mA} \\times 750 \\Omega = 1.3890 \\text{ V}$$\n$$V_{CQ} = V_{CC} - I_{CQ} R_C = 15 \\text{ V} - (1.8337 \\text{ mA} \\times 3.6 \\text{ k}\\Omega) = 15 \\text{ V} - 6.6013 \\text{ V} = 8.3987 \\text{ V}$$\n\nThe quiescent collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CEQ}$, is:\n$$V_{CEQ} = V_{CQ} - V_{EQ} = 8.3987 \\text{ V} - 1.3890 \\text{ V} = 7.0097 \\text{ V}$$\n\nNext, we determine the limits on the output voltage swing.

This corresponds to the maximum positive (upward) swing of the AC output voltage. The peak AC current cannot exceed the DC bias current $I_{CQ}$. The maximum upward voltage swing, $\\Delta V_{up}$, is given by:\n    $$\\Delta V_{up} = I_{CQ} \\times R'_{L} = 1.8337 \\text{ mA} \\times 2.0386 \\text{ k}\\Omega = 3.7379 \\text{ V}$$\n\n2.  **Saturation Limit:** The transistor enters saturation when the collector-emitter voltage $v_{CE}(t)$ drops to $V_{CE,sat}$. This corresponds to the maximum negative (downward) swing of the AC output voltage. Since the voltage gain of a CB amplifier is large and non-inverting, the AC emitter voltage swing is much smaller than the AC collector voltage swing. Therefore, the total AC swing across the collector-emitter terminals can be approximated by the collector voltage swing alone. The maximum downward voltage swing, $\\Delta V_{down}$, is the difference between the quiescent $V_{CEQ}$ and the saturation voltage $V_{CE,sat}$:\n    $$\\Delta V_{down} = V_{CEQ} - V_{CE,sat} = 7.0097 \\text{ V} - 0.2 \\text{ V} = 6.8097 \\text{ V}$$\n\nFor a symmetrical swing, the peak output voltage is limited by the smaller of these two values:\n$$V_{peak,max} = \\min(\\Delta V_{up}, \\Delta V_{down}) = \\min(3.7379 \\text{ V}, 6.8097 \\text{ V}) = 3.7379 \\text{ V}$$\n\nThe maximum symmetrical peak-to-peak output voltage swing, $V_{pp,max}$, is twice the maximum peak swing:\n$$V_{pp,max} = 2 \\times V_{peak,max} = 2 \\times 3.7379 \\text{ V} = 7.4758 \\text{ V}$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$V_{pp,max} = 7.48 \\text{ V}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.48}$$", "id": "1290765"}]}
