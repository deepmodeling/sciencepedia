The problem states that the quiescent emitter voltage $V_E$ must be 0 V. The relationship between the base and emitter voltages for an NPN BJT in the forward-active region is given by:\n$$V_B = V_E + V_{BE}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_B = 0 \\text{ V} + 0.70 \\text{ V} = 0.70 \\text{ V}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the quiescent base current, $I_B$.
