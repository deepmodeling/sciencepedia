To protect a sensitive load from accidental reverse voltage application, a Schottky diode is placed in series with the power source and the load. The circuit consists of a single stable Direct Current (DC) voltage source with voltage $V_S$, the Schottky diode, and a load represented by a resistor of resistance $R$, all connected in a single series loop. The positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the anode of the diode, ensuring it is forward-biased during normal operation.\n\nAssume the DC voltage source provides a constant voltage of $V_S = 5.0 \\text{ V}$.

KVL states that the algebraic sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop is zero.\n\nThe circuit consists of a voltage source $V_S$, a Schottky diode with forward voltage drop $V_F$, and a resistor $R$. Let $I$ be the current flowing through the circuit. As we traverse the loop, we account for the voltage rise from the source and the voltage drops across the diode and the resistor.\n\nStarting from the negative terminal of the source and moving through the loop in the direction of the current, we have a voltage rise of $+V_S$ across the source. Then, we encounter a voltage drop of $-V_F$ across the forward-biased Schottky diode. Finally, there is a voltage drop across the resistor, which is given by Ohm's Law as $V_R = I \\times R$.\n\nThe KVL equation for the loop is:\n$$V_S - V_F - V_R = 0$$\n\nSubstituting Ohm's Law for the resistor's voltage drop, $V_R = I \\times R$, into the KVL equation, we get:\n$$V_S - V_F - I R = 0$$\n\nOur goal is to find the current $I$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $I$:\n$$I R = V_S - V_F$$\n$$I = \\frac{V_S - V_F}{R}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe source voltage is $V_S = 5.0 \\text{ V}$.\nThe diode forward voltage drop is $V_F = 0.30 \\text{ V}$.\nThe resistance is $R = 1.0 \\text{ k}\\Omega = 1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ }\\Omega$.\n\nPlugging these values in:\n$$I = \\frac{5.0 \\text{ V} - 0.30 \\text{ V}}{1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ }\\Omega}$$\n$$I = \\frac{4.7 \\text{ V}}{1000 \\text{ }\\Omega}$$\n$$I = 0.0047 \\text{ A}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed in milliamperes (mA).
