The purpose is to shift the entire signal so that its minimum voltage level becomes 0 V, making it suitable for processing by unipolar electronic components.\n\nThe circuit consists of a capacitor $C$ connected in series with an input voltage source. The output is taken across a resistor $R$. An ideal diode is connected in parallel with the resistor $R$ and is oriented to clamp the most negative part of the output voltage waveform at 0 V.\n\nThe input signal, $v_{in}(t)$, is a symmetric square wave with a period $T$. It alternates between a peak positive voltage of $+V_p$ and a peak negative voltage of $-V_p$. Specifically, for one half of the period, $v_{in}(t) = +V_p$, and for the other half, $v_{in}(t) = -V_p$.\n\nThe clamper circuit is considered ideal. This implies two conditions:\n1. The diode is an ideal diode, behaving as a perfect short circuit when forward-biased and a perfect open circuit when reverse-biased.\n2.
