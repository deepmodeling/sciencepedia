Express your answer in volts (V).", "solution": "The problem asks for the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of the output voltage $v_{out}(t)$ of a positive parallel clipper circuit. The key is to first determine the waveform of $v_{out}(t)$ by analyzing the behavior of the diode $D$ during the positive and negative half-cycles of the input square wave.\n\nThe diode $D$ will turn on (conduct) only if the voltage at its anode, which is $v_{out}(t)$, tends to rise above its forward voltage, $V_f = 0.70 \\text{ V}$. When the diode is on, it clamps the output voltage at $v_{out}(t) = V_f$. When the voltage at its anode is less than $V_f$, the diode is off and acts as an open circuit.\n\nLet's analyze the circuit's response to the input signal $v_{in}(t)$.\n\n**1. Analysis for the positive half-cycle ($0 \\le t < T/2$):**\nDuring this interval, the input voltage is $v_{in}(t) = V_{amp} = 0.50 \\text{ V}$.\nLet's assume the diode is off. In this state, it acts as an open circuit. Since no current can flow through the diode, no current flows through the series resistor $R$ either. According to Ohm's law, the voltage drop across the resistor is $V_R = I \\cdot R = 0 \\cdot R = 0 \\text{ V}$.\nBy Kirchhoff's Voltage Law around the input loop, $v_{in}(t) - V_R - v_{out}(t) = 0$. With $V_R = 0$, this implies $v_{out}(t) = v_{in}(t)$.\nSo, under the assumption that the diode is off, the output voltage would be $v_{out}(t) = 0.50 \\text{ V}$.\n\nNow, we must check if this assumption is valid. The diode remains off as long as the voltage across it, $v_{out}(t)$, is less than its forward voltage $V_f$.\nWe have $v_{out}(t) = 0.50 \\text{ V}$ and $V_f = 0.70 \\text{ V}$.\nSince $0.50 \\text{ V}  0.70 \\text{ V}$, our assumption is correct. The diode remains off throughout the entire positive half-cycle.\nTherefore, for $0 \\le t  T/2$, the output voltage is $v_{out}(t) = V_{amp} = 0.50 \\text{ V}$.\n\n**2. Analysis for the negative half-cycle ($T/2 \\le t  T$):**\nDuring this interval, the input voltage is $v_{in}(t) = -V_{amp} = -0.50 \\text{ V}$.\nIf we again assume the diode is off (open circuit), no current flows, the voltage drop across $R$ is zero, and $v_{out}(t) = v_{in}(t) = -0.50 \\text{ V}$.\nFor the diode to turn on, its anode voltage ($v_{out}$) must be more positive than its cathode voltage (ground, 0 V) by at least $V_f$. In this half-cycle, the anode voltage is negative ($-0.50 \\text{ V}$), so the diode is reverse-biased and is definitively off.\nOur assumption is again correct.\nTherefore, for $T/2 \\le t  T$, the output voltage is $v_{out}(t) = -V_{amp} = -0.50 \\text{ V}$.\n\n**3. Output Waveform and RMS Calculation:**\nFrom the analysis, we see that the diode never turns on. The clipper circuit does not clip the signal because the input voltage's maximum positive value ($0.50 \\text{ V}$) is less than the diode's turn-on voltage ($0.70 \\text{ V}$). Consequently, the output voltage waveform $v_{out}(t)$ is identical to the input voltage waveform $v_{in}(t)$:\n$$\nv_{out}(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nV_{amp}  \\text{for } 0 \\le t  T/2 \\\\\n-V_{amp}  \\text{for } T/2 \\le t  T\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe value of the resistor $R$ and period $T$ do not affect the result.\n\nThe RMS value of a periodic waveform $v(t)$ over a period $T$ is given by the formula:\n$$V_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} [v(t)]^2 dt}$$\nApplying this to our output waveform $v_{out}(t)$:\n$$V_{out, rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\int_{0}^{T/2} [v_{out}(t)]^2 dt + \\int_{T/2}^{T} [v_{out}(t)]^2 dt \\right)}$$\nSubstitute the values of $v_{out}(t)$ in each interval:\n$$V_{out, rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\int_{0}^{T/2} (V_{amp})^2 dt + \\int_{T/2}^{T} (-V_{amp})^2 dt \\right)}$$\nSince $(-V_{amp})^2 = V_{amp}^2$, the integrand becomes a constant $V_{amp}^2$ over the whole period.\n$$V_{out, rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\int_{0}^{T/2} V_{amp}^2 dt + \\int_{T/2}^{T} V_{amp}^2 dt \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} V_{amp}^2 dt}$$\nNow, we perform the integration:\n$$V_{out, rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\left[ V_{amp}^2 \\cdot t \\right]_{0}^{T}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} (V_{amp}^2 \\cdot T - 0)}$$\n$$V_{out, rms} = \\sqrt{V_{amp}^2} = |V_{amp}|$$\nGiven that $V_{amp} = 0.50 \\text{ V}$, which is positive:\n$$V_{out, rms} = 0.50 \\text{ V}$$\nThe RMS value of the output voltage is 0.50 V.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.50}$$", "id": "1299204"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of the diode's turn-on condition, we now analyze a circuit where clipping is actively occurring.
