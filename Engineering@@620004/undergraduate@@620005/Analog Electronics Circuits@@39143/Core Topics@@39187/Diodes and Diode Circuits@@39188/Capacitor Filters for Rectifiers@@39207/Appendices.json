This first exercise guides you through deriving the core relationship for ripple voltage from first principles. By modeling the load as a constant current source, we can simplify the analysis and use the basic capacitor equation, $I = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$, to clearly see how capacitance, load current, and ripple frequency are interconnected [@problem_id:1286236]. This foundational derivation is key to mastering power supply design.", "problem": "An electronics hobbyist is designing a simple DC power supply for a custom-built digital circuit. The power supply starts with a transformer that steps down the mains AC voltage. The output of the transformer's secondary coil is a sinusoidal voltage with a peak value of $V_p$ and a frequency of $f_{\\text{in}}$. This AC voltage is then fed into an ideal full-wave bridge rectifier. To smooth the rectified DC output, a filter capacitor with capacitance $C$ is placed in parallel with the load.\n\nThe digital circuit, when in its steady operating mode, draws a nearly constant current, and can thus be accurately modeled as a constant current load that sinks a current $I_L$.\n\nAssuming the diodes in the rectifier are ideal (i.e., they have zero forward voltage drop and infinite reverse resistance) and that the resulting peak-to-peak ripple voltage, $V_{r,pp}$, is much smaller than the peak voltage $V_p$, derive a symbolic expression for $V_{r,pp}$ in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "The problem asks for the peak-to-peak ripple voltage, $V_{r,pp}$, across a capacitor filter connected to a full-wave rectifier that supplies a constant current load $I_L$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the output of the ideal full-wave rectifier before the capacitor is added. A full-wave rectifier inverts the negative half-cycles of the input AC sine wave. If the input AC voltage has a frequency $f_{\\text{in}}$, the rectified waveform will consist of a series of positive half-sine pulses. The frequency of this rectified waveform, which is also the fundamental frequency of the ripple, $f_r$, is twice the input frequency:\n$$f_r = 2 f_{\\text{in}}$$\nThe period of the ripple is the inverse of the ripple frequency:\n$$T_r = \\frac{1}{f_r} = \\frac{1}{2 f_{\\text{in}}}$$\n\nNow, consider the action of the filter capacitor $C$. The capacitor charges up to the peak voltage of the rectified waveform. Since the diodes are ideal, there is no voltage drop across them. Therefore, the capacitor charges to the peak voltage of the transformer's secondary coil, $V_{p}$.\n\nAfter reaching the peak voltage $V_{p}$, the rectified voltage begins to decrease. At this point, the capacitor voltage is higher than the rectifier's output voltage, causing the rectifier diodes to become reverse-biased. The rectifier is now effectively disconnected from the load. The capacitor begins to discharge, supplying the constant current $I_L$ to the load.\n\nThe relationship between the current through a capacitor, $I_C(t)$, its capacitance $C$, and the rate of change of voltage across it, $\\frac{dV_C(t)}{dt}$, is given by:\n$$I_C(t) = C \\frac{dV_C(t)}{dt}$$\nDuring the discharge phase, the capacitor is the sole source of current for the load. Thus, the current flowing out of the capacitor is $I_L$. Taking the convention that current flowing out of the positive terminal is negative, we have $I_C = -I_L$.\n$$-I_L = C \\frac{dV_C}{dt}$$\nSince both $I_L$ and $C$ are constants, the rate of change of the capacitor voltage is also constant:\n$$\\frac{dV_C}{dt} = -\\frac{I_L}{C}$$\nThis indicates that the capacitor voltage decreases linearly with time during the discharge period.\n\nThe peak-to-peak ripple voltage, $V_{r,pp}$, is the amount the voltage drops during this discharge phase. The discharge continues until the rising voltage of the next half-sine pulse from the rectifier becomes equal to the capacitor voltage. At this point, the diodes become forward-biased again, and the capacitor starts to recharge.\n\nThe problem states that we can assume the ripple voltage is small ($V_{r,pp} \\ll V_p$). This is the \"small ripple approximation\". Under this approximation, the time taken for the capacitor to recharge is very small compared to the discharge time. Therefore, we can approximate the duration of the discharge period, $\\Delta t_{\\text{discharge}}$, as being nearly equal to the entire ripple period, $T_r$.\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{discharge}} \\approx T_r = \\frac{1}{2 f_{\\text{in}}}$$\n\nThe total drop in voltage across the capacitor during discharge is the peak-to-peak ripple voltage. We can calculate this using the constant rate of voltage drop:\n$$V_{r,pp} = \\left| \\Delta V_C \\right| = \\left| \\frac{dV_C}{dt} \\right| \\Delta t_{\\text{discharge}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rate of voltage change and the discharge time:\n$$V_{r,pp} = \\left( \\frac{I_L}{C} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2 f_{\\text{in}}} \\right)$$\nCombining the terms gives the final expression for the peak-to-peak ripple voltage:\n$$V_{r,pp} = \\frac{I_L}{2 f_{\\text{in}} C}$$\nNote that the peak voltage $V_p$ does not appear in the final expression, a direct consequence of the constant current load model and the small ripple approximation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{I_L}{2f_{\\text{in}}C}}$$", "id": "1286236"}, {"introduction": "With the fundamental theory in hand, we can now tackle a practical design problem.
