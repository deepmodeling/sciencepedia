Express your answer in volts.", "solution": "The state of an ideal diode is determined by the voltage across it and the current through it. An ideal diode is considered 'ON' or conducting when there is a positive current flowing from its anode to its cathode. When it is ON, an ideal diode exhibits a zero-voltage drop across its terminals. Conversely, the diode is 'OFF' when the voltage at its anode is less than the voltage at its cathode, and in this state, it allows zero current to pass. The transition between these two states occurs when the diode is at the threshold of conduction, where the anode-to-cathode voltage is zero and the current is infinitesimally greater than zero.\n\nLet $V_A$ denote the voltage at the central node A. The anode of the ideal diode D is connected to node A, so its voltage is $V_{anode} = V_A$. The cathode is connected to the voltage source $V_2$, so its voltage is $V_{cathode} = V_2$.\n\nFor the diode to be in the ON state, it must be forward-biased, and a positive current $I_D$ must flow through it. The condition for an ideal diode to be ON is that it acts as a short circuit, meaning the voltage across it is zero.\n$$V_D = V_{anode} - V_{cathode} = 0$$\nThis implies that for the diode to be ON, the voltage at node A must be equal to the voltage at the cathode.\n$$V_A = V_2$$\n\nWith the voltage at node A determined, we can apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at this node. KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving it. Let's define the current through the diode, $I_D$, as leaving node A. The currents from the branches containing $V_{in}$ and $V_1$ can be defined as entering node A.\n\nThe current entering node A from the $V_{in}$ branch is $I_{in} = \\frac{V_{in} - V_A}{R_1}$.\nThe current entering node A from the $V_1$ branch is $I_1 = \\frac{V_1 - V_A}{R_2}$.\n\nAccording to KCL at node A:\n$$I_{in} + I_1 = I_D$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the currents:\n$$I_D = \\frac{V_{in} - V_A}{R_1} + \\frac{V_1 - V_A}{R_2}$$\n\nNow, we impose the condition for the diode being ON, which is $V_A = V_2$. Substituting this into the KCL equation:\n$$I_D = \\frac{V_{in} - V_2}{R_1} + \\frac{V_1 - V_2}{R_2}$$\n\nFor the diode to be considered truly ON, the current $I_D$ must be positive ($I_D > 0$). The minimum input voltage $V_{in}$ that turns the diode ON corresponds to the threshold where $I_D$ is just about to become positive. We can find this by solving the inequality $I_D > 0$ for $V_{in}$.\n$$\\frac{V_{in} - V_2}{R_1} + \\frac{V_1 - V_2}{R_2} > 0$$\nLet's isolate the term containing $V_{in}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{in} - V_2}{R_1} > - \\left( \\frac{V_1 - V_2}{R_2} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{V_{in} - V_2}{R_1} > \\frac{V_2 - V_1}{R_2}$$\nNow, solve for $V_{in}$:\n$$V_{in} - V_2 > R_1 \\left( \\frac{V_2 - V_1}{R_2} \\right)$$\n$$V_{in} > V_2 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2} (V_2 - V_1)$$\nThis inequality defines the entire range of input voltages for which the diode is ON. The minimum voltage, $V_{in, min}$, required to turn the diode ON is the value at the boundary of this inequality.\n$$V_{in, min} = V_2 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2} (V_2 - V_1)$$\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $R_1 = 5.0 \\text{ k}\\Omega$, $R_2 = 2.0 \\text{ k}\\Omega$, $V_1 = 3.0 \\text{ V}$, and $V_2 = 6.0 \\text{ V}$.\n$$V_{in, min} = 6.0 \\text{ V} + \\frac{5.0 \\text{ k}\\Omega}{2.0 \\text{ k}\\Omega} (6.0 \\text{ V} - 3.0 \\text{ V})$$\nThe k$\\Omega$ units cancel out.\n$$V_{in, min} = 6.0 + 2.5 \\times (3.0)$$\n$$V_{in, min} = 6.0 + 7.5$$\n$$V_{in, min} = 13.5 \\text{ V}$$\nTherefore, the minimum input voltage required to turn the ideal diode ON is 13.5 V.

Let's analyze the voltages at the diode's terminals. The anode of the diode is connected to the positive terminal of the sinusoidal source.
