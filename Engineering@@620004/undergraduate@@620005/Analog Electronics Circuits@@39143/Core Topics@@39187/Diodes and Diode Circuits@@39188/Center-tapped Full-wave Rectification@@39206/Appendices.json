The design utilizes a center-tapped transformer followed by a full-wave rectifier. The transformer's secondary winding is center-tapped, with the voltage between the center tap and either of the two ends being a sinusoidal signal. For one half of the winding, this voltage is $v_{s1}(t) = V_p \\sin(\\omega t)$, and for the other half, it is $v_{s2}(t) = -V_p \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n\nThe rectifier is built with two identical diodes, D1 and D2. Diode D1 is connected to the first half of the winding, and D2 is connected to the second half. Their cathodes are joined together to form the positive output terminal. A resistive load, representing the pre-amplifier with resistance $R_L$, is connected between this positive terminal and the transformer's center tap.\n\nFor thermal management calculations, each diode is modeled with a constant forward voltage drop of $V_F$ when it is conducting current. When a diode is reverse-biased, it is treated as an ideal open circuit. The dynamic forward resistance of the diodes is considered negligible. It is given that the peak voltage $V_p$ is greater than the diode forward voltage drop $V_F$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the average power, $P_{D,avg}$, dissipated in a single one of the diodes over one full period of the input AC signal.
