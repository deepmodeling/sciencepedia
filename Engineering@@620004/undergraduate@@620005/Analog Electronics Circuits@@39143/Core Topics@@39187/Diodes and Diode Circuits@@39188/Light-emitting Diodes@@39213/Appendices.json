This practice explores a common conceptual puzzle: connecting two LEDs with different forward voltages in parallel with just one resistor. By analyzing this seemingly simple circuit, you will uncover the principle of voltage clamping and learn why the LED with the lower forward voltage, $V_F$, dominates the branch and is the only one to light up.

The circuit consists of two different Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) connected in parallel with each other. This parallel combination is connected in series with a single current-limiting resistor of resistance $R = 220 \\, \\Omega$ to the voltage source.\n\nThe two LEDs have different characteristics. They can be modeled as ideal components that begin to conduct current and emit light only when the voltage across them reaches their specific forward voltage, $V_F$. Once conducting, the voltage drop across them remains constant at $V_F$.\n- The first LED is red and has a forward voltage of $V_{F, \\text{red}} = 1.8 \\, \\text{V}$.\n- The second LED is blue and has a forward voltage of $V_{F, \\text{blue}} = 3.0 \\, \\text{V}$.\n\nBelow its forward voltage, an LED is considered to be \"off\" and draws negligible current. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the observable state of the LEDs once the circuit is powered on?\n\nA. Only the red LED will light up.\n\nB. Only the blue LED will light up.\n\nC. Both the red and blue LEDs will light up.\n\nD. Neither of the LEDs will light up.\n\nE. Both LEDs will be immediately damaged by excessive current.", "solution": "Let the voltage source be $V_{S}$, the series resistor be $R$, and the two LEDs be ideal fixed-drop elements with forward voltages $V_{F,\\text{red}}$ and $V_{F,\\text{blue}}$, where $V_{F,\\text{red}}<V_{F,\\text{blue}}$. The two LEDs are connected in parallel, so they share the same branch voltage. Let the voltage across the parallel LED branch be $V_{D}$.\n\nApply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law around the loop when at least one LED conducts:\n$$\nV_{S}=I_{R}R+V_{D},\n$$\nso the series current (and hence the conducting LED current) is\n$$\nI_{R}=\\frac{V_{S}-V_{D}}{R}.\n$$\n\nAnalyze possible conduction states under the ideal fixed-drop model:\n\n1) Neither LED on: If both are off, then branch current is zero, so $I_{R}=0$ and the resistor drop is zero. Hence the node voltage equals the source voltage, $V_{D}=V_{S}$. Since $V_{S}\\geq \\min\\{V_{F,\\text{red}},V_{F,\\text{blue}}\\}=V_{F,\\text{red}}$, this would forward-bias at least the red LED, contradicting the assumption that both are off. Therefore, the “neither on” state is not possible.\n\n2) Both LEDs on: In the ideal fixed-drop model, if both conduct, the shared branch voltage must simultaneously satisfy\n$$\nV_{D}=V_{F,\\text{red}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad V_{D}=V_{F,\\text{blue}},\n$$\nwhich would require $V_{F,\\text{red}}=V_{F,\\text{blue}}$. Given $V_{F,\\text{red}}\\neq V_{F,\\text{blue}}$, this is impossible. Therefore, both cannot be on simultaneously.\n\n3) Red only on: If only the red LED conducts, then\n$$\nV_{D}=V_{F,\\text{red}},\n$$\nand the blue LED remains off provided\n$$\nV_{D}<V_{F,\\text{blue}}.\n$$\nSince $V_{F,\\text{red}}<V_{F,\\text{blue}}$, this condition holds. The resulting current is\n$$\nI_{R}=\\frac{V_{S}-V_{F,\\text{red}}}{R}>0\n$$\nbecause $V_{S}>V_{F,\\text{red}}$ as given, so this state is self-consistent and physically realizable.\n\n4) Blue only on: If only the blue LED conducts, then\n$$\nV_{D}=V_{F,\\text{blue}}.\n$$\nFor the red LED to remain off we would need $V_{D}<V_{F,\\text{red}}$, but this contradicts $V_{F,\\text{blue}}>V_{F,\\text{red}}$. Hence the “blue only” state is impossible.\n\nFrom the above, the only consistent operating point is that the red LED conducts, clamping $V_{D}$ to $V_{F,\\text{red}}$, while the blue LED remains off because $V_{F,\\text{red}}<V_{F,\\text{blue}}$. The series resistor limits the current to $I_{R}=(V_{S}-V_{F,\\text{red}})/R$, which is finite; therefore the claim of immediate damage by excessive current is not supported in this configuration.
