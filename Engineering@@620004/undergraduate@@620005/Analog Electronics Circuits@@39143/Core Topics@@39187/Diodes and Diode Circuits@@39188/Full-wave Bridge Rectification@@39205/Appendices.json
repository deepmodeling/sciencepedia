The load resistor $R_L$ is connected across the output terminals, which are the junction of (D1 cathode, D2 cathode) and (D3 anode, D4 anode).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the behavior of a normal, functioning bridge rectifier with ideal diodes.\n1.  **Positive half-cycle ($0 \\le t  T/2$):** When $v_{in}(t)  0$, diodes D1 and D3 are forward-biased, while D2 and D4 are reverse-biased. The current flows from the source, through D1, through the load resistor $R_L$, through D3, and back to the source. Since the diodes are ideal, they act as short circuits when forward-biased. The output voltage across the load is $v_{out}(t) = v_{in}(t)$.\n2.  **Negative half-cycle ($T/2 \\le t  T$):** When $v_{in}(t)  0$, diodes D2 and D4 are forward-biased, while D1 and D3 are reverse-biased.

We must re-evaluate the circuit's operation for both half-cycles.\n\n1.  **Positive half-cycle ($0 \\le t  T/2$):** For current to flow through the load, it would need to pass through diode D1. Since D1 is an open circuit, the path for the positive half-cycle is broken. No current flows through the load resistor $R_L$. Therefore, the voltage across the load is $v_{out}(t) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Negative half-cycle ($T/2 \\le t  T$):** For the negative half-cycle, the current path is through D4, the load $R_L$, and D2.
