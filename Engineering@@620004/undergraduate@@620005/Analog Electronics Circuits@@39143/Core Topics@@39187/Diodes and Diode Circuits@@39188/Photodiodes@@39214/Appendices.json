The core of the circuit uses a photodiode to convert incoming light into an electrical signal.

The anode of the photodiode is connected to ground. This orientation means the photocurrent flows into the inverting input node.\n- The non-inverting input of the op-amp is also connected to ground.\n- A single feedback resistor, with resistance $R_f$, is connected between the output of the op-amp and its inverting input.\n\nWhen the photodiode is illuminated with a specific intensity of light, it generates a constant photocurrent $I_{ph} = 50.0 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{A}$.

We can solve this by applying the rules for an ideal op-amp and Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL).\n\nThe two fundamental rules for an ideal op-amp in a negative feedback configuration are:\n1. The currents flowing into the inverting ($i_-$) and non-inverting ($i_+$) inputs are zero. So, $i_- = i_+ = 0$.\n2. The voltage at the inverting input ($v_-$) is equal to the voltage at the non-inverting input ($v_+$). So, $v_- = v_+$.\n\nLet's analyze the given circuit based on these rules.\nThe non-inverting input ($v_+$) is connected to ground. Therefore, its voltage is $v_+ = 0 \\text{ V}$.\nAccording to the second ideal op-amp rule, the voltage at the inverting input must also be zero: $v_- = v_+ = 0 \\text{ V}$. This means the inverting input is a \"virtual ground\".\n\nNow, we apply KCL at the inverting input node. The sum of currents entering this node must equal the sum of currents leaving it. The currents connected to this node are:\n- The photocurrent $I_{ph}$ from the photodiode, which flows into the node.\n- The current through the feedback resistor $R_f$, which we will call $I_f$.\n- The input current to the op-amp's inverting terminal, $i_-$.\n\nThe KCL equation at the inverting node is:\n$$\nI_{ph} + I_f = i_-\n$$\nHere, we have defined $I_f$ as the current flowing from the op-amp output, through the resistor $R_f$, and into the inverting node.\nUsing the first ideal op-amp rule, we know that $i_- = 0$. So the KCL equation simplifies to:\n$$\nI_{ph} + I_f = 0 \\implies I_f = -I_{ph}\n$$\nThe current through the feedback resistor, $I_f$, can be expressed using Ohm's Law. The voltage across the resistor is the difference between the voltage at the output, $V_{out}$, and the voltage at the inverting input, $v_-$.\n$$\nI_f = \\frac{V_{out} - v_-}{R_f}\n$$\nSince $v_- = 0$ (virtual ground), this simplifies to:\n$$\nI_f = \\frac{V_{out}}{R_f}\n$$\nNow we can substitute this expression for $I_f$ back into our KCL result:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{out}}{R_f} = -I_{ph}\n$$\nWe need to find the resistance $R_f$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $R_f$:\n$$\nR_f = -\\frac{V_{out}}{I_{ph}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- The desired output voltage is $V_{out} = -2.50 \\text{ V}$.\n- The photocurrent is $I_{ph} = 50.0 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{A} = 50.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ A}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into our expression for $R_f$:\n$$\nR_f = -\\frac{-2.50 \\text{ V}}{50.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ A}} = \\frac{2.50}{50.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\text{ }\\Omega\n$$\n$$\nR_f = \\frac{2.50}{50.0} \\times 10^{6} \\text{ }\\Omega = 0.0500 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ }\\Omega = 50000 \\text{ }\\Omega\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in kilo-ohms (k$\\Omega$).
