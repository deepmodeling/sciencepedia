This first practice [@problem_id:1319646] challenges you to identify the correct graphical method to linearize the saturation region characteristic, allowing for a direct and intuitive extraction of the threshold voltage, $V_{th}$.", "problem": "An integrated circuit designer is characterizing a pair of n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), labeled M1 and M2, that were fabricated side-by-side on the same silicon wafer. The design intent was for them to be perfectly matched. To check for process variations, the designer measures the drain current ($I_D$) versus the gate-source voltage ($V_{GS}$) for each transistor, ensuring that the drain-source voltage ($V_{DS}$) is kept high enough so that both devices remain in the saturation region of operation for all measurements where $V_{GS}$ is above the threshold voltage. The square-law model for a MOSFET in saturation is given by $I_D = \\frac{1}{2} k_n (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2$, where $k_n$ is the transconductance parameter and $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage.\n\nThe designer suspects there might be a mismatch in the threshold voltages ($V_{th1}$ and $V_{th2}$) between the two devices.

Plot the data on a semi-log scale, with $\\ln(I_D)$ on the y-axis and $V_{GS}$ on the x-axis. The threshold voltage for each device is found at the $V_{GS}$ value where the data deviates from a straight line. The mismatch is the difference between these two values.\n\nE. Plot $I_D$ versus $V_{GS}^2$ for both transistors. The resulting approximately straight lines will have a difference in their y-intercepts that is proportional to the square of the threshold voltage mismatch.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct graphical method to determine the mismatch in threshold voltages, $|V_{th1} - V_{th2}|$, between two MOSFETs from their transfer characteristics in the saturation region.\n\nThe governing equation for a MOSFET in saturation is:\n$$I_D = \\frac{1}{2} k_n (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2$$\nHere, $I_D$ is the drain current, $V_{GS}$ is the gate-source voltage, $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage, and $k_n$ is the transconductance parameter, specific to the device's material properties and geometry ($k_n = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}$).\n\nTo extract $V_{th}$ from this quadratic equation, we can linearize it. Taking the square root of both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\\sqrt{I_D} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_n}{2}} (V_{GS} - V_{th})$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = m(x-x_0)$, where:\n- The y-variable is $y = \\sqrt{I_D}$.\n- The x-variable is $x = V_{GS}$.\n- The slope is $m = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_n}{2}}$.\n- The x-intercept is $x_0 = V_{th}$ (the value of $x$ for which $y=0$).\n\nTherefore, by plotting $\\sqrt{I_D}$ versus $V_{GS}$, we expect to see a straight line for the portion of the characteristic where the device is in saturation ($V_{GS} > V_{th}$). Extrapolating this straight line down to the horizontal axis ($\\sqrt{I_D} = 0$) gives an intercept point equal to the threshold voltage, $V_{th}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze this for the two transistors, M1 and M2.\nFor M1: $\\sqrt{I_{D1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{n1}}{2}} (V_{GS} - V_{th1})$\nFor M2: $\\sqrt{I_{D2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{n2}}{2}} (V_{GS} - V_{th2})$\n\nSince the transistors are fabricated side-by-side and are intended to be matched, their physical and electrical properties should be very similar. This means their transconductance parameters should be nearly identical, so $k_{n1} \\approx k_{n2}$. Consequently, the slopes of their $\\sqrt{I_D}$ vs. $V_{GS}$ plots will be nearly equal, meaning the two lines will be approximately parallel.\n\nThe x-intercept for M1 is $V_{th1}$, and the x-intercept for M2 is $V_{th2}$. The horizontal distance between these two parallel lines at any given $\\sqrt{I_D}$ value, including the intercept at $\\sqrt{I_D}=0$, is therefore the difference between their x-intercepts, which is $|V_{th1} - V_{th2}|$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This option correctly states that plotting $\\sqrt{I_D}$ vs. $V_{GS}$ yields parallel straight lines (assuming matched $k_n$) and that the horizontal separation between these lines corresponds to the threshold voltage mismatch, $|V_{th1} - V_{th2}|$. This is the standard and most direct method.\n\nB. This option claims the difference in slopes represents the $V_{th}$ mismatch. This is incorrect. The slope is $m = \\sqrt{k_n/2}$. A difference in slopes indicates a mismatch in the transconductance parameter $k_n$, not $V_{th}$.\n\nC. This option suggests analyzing the transconductance, $g_m$. In saturation, $g_m = \\frac{dI_D}{dV_{GS}} = k_n(V_{GS} - V_{th})$. Plotting $g_m$ vs. $V_{GS}$ also yields a straight line with an x-intercept at $V_{th}$. Thus, the horizontal shift between the two $g_m$ plots would also reveal the $V_{th}$ mismatch. However, the option incorrectly suggests looking at the *vertical* separation. A vertical separation at a constant $V_{GS}$ would be $\\Delta g_m = g_{m1}-g_{m2} = k_{n1}(V_{GS}-V_{th1}) - k_{n2}(V_{GS}-V_{th2})$, which depends on mismatches in both $k_n$ and $V_{th}$ and is not a direct measure of either. This option is incorrect in its interpretation.\n\nD. A plot of $\\ln(I_D)$ vs. $V_{GS}$ is used to analyze the subthreshold (weak inversion) region, where current depends exponentially on $V_{GS}$. The problem specifies operation in the saturation (strong inversion) region. While methods exist to extract $V_{th}$ from subthreshold plots, they are different from what is described, and this is not the most direct way to analyze the given saturation data based on the square-law model.\n\nE. Plotting $I_D$ vs. $V_{GS}^2$ does not linearize the equation. The relationship is $I_D \\propto (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2 = V_{GS}^2 - 2V_{GS}V_{th} + V_{th}^2$. The presence of the term linear in $V_{GS}$ means the plot is not a straight line. Thus, this method is invalid.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A provides the correct and most direct method.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1319646"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental transfer characteristic, we now explore how a transistor's physical dimensions influence its performance.
