The source terminal is connected to ground. A resistor with resistance $R_D$ is connected between a positive supply voltage $V_{DD}$ and the drain terminal. The gate terminal's voltage is established by a feedback network consisting of two resistors: a resistor $R_1$ connected between the supply voltage $V_{DD}$ and the gate, and a resistor $R_2$ connected between the gate and the drain.\n\nAssume the transistor operates under conditions where the gate current is negligible. The transistor's behavior is characterized by a threshold voltage $V_{th}$ and a process parameter $K_n$, which combines the effects of electron mobility, gate oxide capacitance, and device aspect ratio ($W/L$).

Because the gate current is negligible, the gate voltage $V_G$ is determined by the voltage divider formed by resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ between $V_{DD}$ and $V_D$. This can be expressed using superposition as:\n$$V_{G}=V_{D}+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\left(V_{DD}-V_{D}\\right).$$\nIt is convenient to define a ratio $x \\equiv \\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}$. Then $\\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} = 1-x$, so the gate voltage is $V_G = V_D + (1-x)(V_{DD}-V_D)$. However, using the provided solution's definition is also valid:\n$$V_{G}=V_{D}+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\left(V_{DD}-V_{D}\\right).$$\nLet's redefine $x \\equiv \\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}$ to match the original (flawed) derivation path for ease of checking. The gate voltage is $V_G = V_D + x(V_{DD}-V_D)$.\nThe bias is set at the saturation boundary, $V_{DS}=V_{GS}-V_{th}$. Since $V_S=0$, this simplifies to $V_{D}=V_{G}-V_{th}$. Substituting $V_G$ gives $V_D = (V_D + x(V_{DD}-V_D)) - V_{th}$, which simplifies to $V_{th} = x(V_{DD}-V_D)$. Solving for $V_D$:\n$$V_{D}=V_{DD}-\\frac{V_{th}}{x}.$$\nThe drain current $I_D$ flowing through the resistor $R_D$ is given by Ohm's law:\n$$I_{D}=\\frac{V_{DD}-V_{D}}{R_{D}}=\\frac{V_{th}}{x R_{D}}.$$\nAt the saturation boundary, the MOSFET current is $I_{D}=\\frac{1}{2}K_{n}(V_{GS}-V_{th})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}K_{n}V_{D}^{2}$. Substituting our expression for $V_D$:\n$$I_{D}=\\frac{1}{2}K_{n}\\left(V_{DD}-\\frac{V_{th}}{x}\\right)^{2}.$$\nEquating the two expressions for $I_D$ yields:\n$$\\frac{V_{th}}{x R_{D}}=\\frac{1}{2}K_{n}\\left(V_{DD}-\\frac{V_{th}}{x}\\right)^{2}.$$\nTo solve for the resistance ratio, let $y \\equiv 1/x = (R_1+R_2)/R_2 = 1+R_1/R_2$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{V_{th} y}{R_{D}}=\\frac{1}{2}K_{n}\\left(V_{DD}-V_{th} y\\right)^{2}.$$\nExpanding this and rearranging gives a quadratic equation in $y$:\n$$K_n R_D V_{th}^2 y^2 - 2 V_{th} (K_n R_D V_{DD} + 1) y + K_n R_D V_{DD}^2 = 0.$$\nSolving this for $y$ yields two possible solutions.
