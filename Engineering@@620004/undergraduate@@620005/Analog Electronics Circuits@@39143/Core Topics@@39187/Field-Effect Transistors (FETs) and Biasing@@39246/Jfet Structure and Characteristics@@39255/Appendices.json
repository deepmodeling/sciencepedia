The terminals are arbitrarily labeled T1, T2, and T3. The technician uses a standard digital multimeter (DMM) which has a diode test function. When testing a diode, this function applies a small test voltage between the probes and displays the forward voltage drop (typically 0.5-0.8 V for silicon) if the junction is forward-biased. If the junction is reverse-biased or the resistance is very high, the DMM displays an open-loop or overload symbol, often denoted as 'OL'. The red probe of the DMM is the positive terminal (+) and the black probe is the negative terminal (-).\n\nWhich of the following experimental procedures and corresponding conclusions correctly identifies the JFET's gate terminal and its type (n-channel or p-channel)?\n\nA. The technician uses the ohmmeter function to find the pair of terminals with the lowest resistance reading; these are identified as the source and drain, with the remaining terminal being the gate. To determine the channel type, they connect the DMM's positive (red) probe to the gate and the negative (black) probe to the source. If a low resistance is measured, the device is a p-channel JFET.\n\nB. The technician uses the diode test.

For an n-channel JFET, the channel is n-type and the gate is p-type. For a p-channel JFET, the channel is p-type and the gate is n-type.\n\nThe DMM diode test displays a forward voltage when a PN junction is forward biased. A PN junction is forward biased when the potential on the P side is higher than on the N side, i.e., when the meter’s red lead (positive) is on the P side and the black lead (negative) is on the N side. Symbolically, forward bias occurs when $V_{\\text{P}} - V_{\\text{N}} > 0$.\n\nIn a JFET, the gate forms a PN junction to both the source and the drain. Therefore, there exists a unique terminal (the gate) that will show a diode-like forward reading to both of the other two terminals, provided the polarity matches the PN orientation.\n\nDetermine the polarity:\n- For an n-channel JFET, the gate is p-type and the source/drain are n-type. Thus, with the red lead on the gate and the black lead on either source or drain, each gate-channel junction is forward biased and a forward voltage is indicated to both other terminals. With the black lead on the gate, both junctions are reverse biased and no forward reading appears. Therefore, the pattern “red on unique terminal gives forward readings to both others” identifies an n-channel device.\n- For a p-channel JFET, the gate is n-type and the source/drain are p-type. Thus, with the black lead on the gate and the red lead on either source or drain, each gate-channel junction is forward biased and a forward voltage is indicated to both other terminals. With the red lead on the gate, both junctions are reverse biased and no forward reading appears. Therefore, a pattern “black on unique terminal gives forward readings to both others” identifies a p-channel device.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Identifying source and drain by lowest resistance is plausible, but the channel type test is reversed. Red on gate and black on source forward-biases an n-channel gate-source junction, not p-channel. Hence incorrect.\n- B: “Red on unique terminal shows forward to both others” indeed identifies the gate, but it corresponds to an n-channel JFET, not p-channel. Hence incorrect.\n- C: “Black on unique terminal shows forward to both others” corresponds to a p-channel JFET, not n-channel. Hence incorrect.\n- D: A JFET gate forms junctions to both source and drain; it will not show a forward reading to only one of them. Hence incorrect.\n- E: “Black on unique terminal shows forward to both others” identifies the gate and correctly indicates a p-channel JFET.
