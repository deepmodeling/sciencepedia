This current consists of minority carriers (electrons) that are injected from the emitter and successfully diffuse across the base to be collected by the collector. The current is driven by diffusion. According to Fick's first law, the electron diffusion current density, $J_n$, is given by:\n$$ J_n(x) = q D_n \\frac{dn_p(x)}{dx} $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $D_n$ is the electron diffusion constant, and $n_p(x)$ is the minority carrier (electron) concentration in the p-type base as a function of position $x$.\n\nThe problem states to assume a linear minority carrier concentration profile across the base width $W_B$. Let $x=0$ be the edge of the emitter-base space-charge region and $x=W_B$ be the edge of the collector-base space-charge region. The concentration is maximum at the emitter side, $n_p(0)$, and approximately zero at the collector side, $n_p(W_B) \\approx 0$.\nThe linear profile is thus:\n$$ n_p(x) = n_p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{W_B}\\right) $$\nThe gradient of this concentration profile is:\n$$ \\frac{dn_p(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B} $$\nThis gradient is constant, which implies that the diffusion current density is constant throughout the base (an approximation that ignores the small number of carriers lost to recombination). The collector current, $I_C$, is the magnitude of this diffusion current multiplied by the cross-sectional area, $A$.\n$$ I_C = A \\cdot |J_n| = A \\cdot \\left|q D_n \\left(-\\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B}\\right)\\right| = q A D_n \\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B} $$\n\nNext, let's model the base current, $I_B$. The problem states that this current is solely due to recombination in the base. The total excess minority charge, $Q_n$, stored in the base recombines on average over the minority carrier lifetime, $\\tau_n$. The resulting recombination current is:\n$$ I_B = \\frac{Q_n}{\\tau_n} $$\nTo find $Q_n$, we integrate the excess electron concentration over the volume of the base. Assuming high injection or simply that the excess concentration $\\Delta n_p(x) \\approx n_p(x)$, we have:\n$$ Q_n = q A \\int_0^{W_B} n_p(x) dx $$\nSubstituting the linear profile for $n_p(x)$:\n$$ Q_n = q A \\int_0^{W_B} n_p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{W_B}\\right) dx = q A n_p(0) \\left[x - \\frac{x^2}{2W_B}\\right]_0^{W_B} $$\n$$ Q_n = q A n_p(0) \\left(W_B - \\frac{W_B^2}{2W_B}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} q A n_p(0) W_B $$\nNow, we can find the base current:\n$$ I_B = \\frac{Q_n}{\\tau_n} = \\frac{q A n_p(0) W_B}{2 \\tau_n} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the current gain $\\beta_F$ by taking the ratio of $I_C$ to $I_B$:\n$$ \\beta_F = \\frac{I_C}{I_B} = \\frac{q A D_n \\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B}}{\\frac{q A n_p(0) W_B}{2 \\tau_n}} $$\nThe terms $q$, $A$, and $n_p(0)$ cancel out, leaving a result that depends only on the material and geometric properties of the base:\n$$ \\beta_F = \\frac{D_n / W_B}{W_B / (2 \\tau_n)} = \\frac{2 D_n \\tau_n}{W_B^2} $$\nThis expression reveals that high gain is achieved with a large diffusion constant, a long carrier lifetime, and a very narrow base width. It's also insightful to relate this to the mean base transit time, $\\tau_T$, which is the average time for a carrier to cross the base. It is defined as $\\tau_T = Q_n / I_C$.\n$$ \\tau_T = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} q A n_p(0) W_B}{q A D_n \\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B}} = \\frac{W_B^2}{2 D_n} $$\nUsing this, the gain can be expressed conceptually as the ratio of the carrier lifetime to the transit time: $\\beta_F = \\tau_n / \\tau_T$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.
