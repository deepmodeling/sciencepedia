An external static electric field is applied perpendicular to the surface of the wafer, causing a thin layer of net negative charge to accumulate right at the surface.

Let $\\psi(x)$ denote the electrostatic potential (potential energy per unit positive charge), with $x$ measured from the bulk toward the surface. Let $q>0$ be the magnitude of the electron charge, so the electron charge is $-q$.\n\nIn semiconductor electrostatics, the band edges shift with the electrostatic potential according to the electron potential energy:\n$$\nU_{e}(x) = -q\\,\\psi(x).\n$$\nTherefore the band-edge energies vary as\n$$\nE_{c}(x) = E_{c0} - q\\,\\psi(x), \\quad E_{v}(x) = E_{v0} - q\\,\\psi(x), \\quad E_{i}(x) = E_{i0} - q\\,\\psi(x),\n$$\nwhere $E_{c0}, E_{v0}, E_{i0}$ are constants that fix the reference in the neutral bulk.

The band gap $E_{g} = E_{c} - E_{v}$ remains constant because both edges shift together.\n\nWe determine the sign of $\\psi$ near the surface from the charge sign. The net negative charge in the semiconductor near the surface can arise from electron accumulation and/or depletion of holes leaving negatively charged ionized acceptors.
