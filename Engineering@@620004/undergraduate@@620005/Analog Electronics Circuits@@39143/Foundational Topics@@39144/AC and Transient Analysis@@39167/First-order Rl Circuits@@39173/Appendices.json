This energy can be found by integrating the power dissipated in $R_1$ from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the initial condition of the circuit.**\nFor time $t  0$, the circuit has been connected to the DC power supply for a long time, reaching a steady state. In a DC steady state, an ideal inductor behaves like a short circuit (zero voltage drop). Therefore, the current flowing through the circuit is determined solely by the voltage source $V$ and the coil's internal resistance $R_1$.\nThe initial current, $I_0$, which is the current through the inductor at $t=0^-$, is given by Ohm's law:\n$$I_0 = \\frac{V}{R_1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$I_0 = \\frac{36\\,\\text{V}}{12\\,\\Omega} = 3.0\\,\\text{A}$$\nThe current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously.

The circuit now consists of the inductor discharging through the total resistance $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2$.\nThe behavior of this circuit is described by Kirchhoff's Voltage Law:\n$$L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + (R_1 + R_2)i(t) = 0$$\nThis is a first-order homogeneous differential equation.

The total energy $E_{R1}$ dissipated in $R_1$ from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$ is the integral of this power:\n$$E_{R1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P_1(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} [i(t)]^2 R_1 \\,dt$$\nSubstituting the expression for $i(t)$:\n$$E_{R1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left[I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right]^2 R_1 \\,dt = R_1 I_0^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau}\\right) \\,dt$$\nNow, we evaluate the integral:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau}\\right) \\,dt = \\left[-\\frac{\\tau}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{2} \\exp(0)\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\tau}{2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $E_{R1}$:\n$$E_{R1} = R_1 I_0^2 \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 4: Express the energy in terms of the initial parameters and calculate the value.**\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $I_0 = V/R_1$ and $\\tau = L/(R_1+R_2)$ into the equation for $E_{R1}$:\n$$E_{R1} = R_1 \\left(\\frac{V}{R_1}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{L}{R_1 + R_2}\\right) = \\frac{R_1 V^2}{R_1^2} \\frac{L}{2(R_1 + R_2)} = \\frac{V^2 L}{2 R_1 (R_1+R_2)}$$\nAlternatively, we can use a more intuitive approach based on energy distribution. The total energy initially stored in the inductor is $E_{total} = \\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2$. This total energy is dissipated by the resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$. Since they are in series, they share the same current $i(t)$. The ratio of power dissipated is $P_1(t)/P_2(t) = i(t)^2 R_1 / i(t)^2 R_2 = R_1/R_2$. As this ratio is constant over time, the ratio of total energy dissipated must be the same. Therefore, the energy dissipated by $R_1$ is a fraction of the total energy:\n$$E_{R1} = E_{total} \\times \\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2\\right) \\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}$$\nLet's use this simpler formula.
