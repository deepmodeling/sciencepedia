The circuit's behavior is controlled by a switch that toggles between a charging configuration and a discharging configuration.\n\n**Charging Configuration:**\nThe three resistors are arranged in a T-network. The positive terminal of the voltage source $V_S$ is connected to one end of resistor $R_A$. The other end of $R_A$ connects to a central node, labeled X. From node X, resistor $R_B$ connects to a second node, labeled Y, and resistor $R_C$ connects to ground. The capacitor $C$ is connected between node Y and ground.

Thus, $\\tau = R_{Th} C$.\nThe ratio $\\gamma$ is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\tau_{charge}}{\\tau_{discharge}} = \\frac{R_{Th, charge} C}{R_{Th, discharge} C} = \\frac{R_{Th, charge}}{R_{Th, discharge}}\n$$\nWe need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance for both the charging and discharging configurations, as seen from the terminals of the capacitor (node Y and ground).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the charging Thevenin resistance, $R_{Th, charge}$.**\nIn the charging configuration, the capacitor is connected between node Y and ground. To find the Thevenin resistance, we must deactivate all independent sources. The DC voltage source $V_S$ is an independent source, so we replace it with a short circuit to ground.\n\nAfter deactivating the source, the end of resistor $R_A$ that was connected to $V_S$ is now connected to ground. The other end of $R_A$ is at node X. Resistor $R_C$ is connected between node X and ground. Therefore, from the perspective of node X, resistors $R_A$ and $R_C$ are in parallel. The equivalent resistance of this parallel combination, let's call it $R_{Xg}$, is:\n$$\nR_{Xg} = R_A || R_C = \\frac{R_A R_C}{R_A + R_C}\n$$\nThe capacitor is connected at node Y. To find the resistance seen from node Y to ground, we see resistor $R_B$ connected in series with the resistance from node X to ground, $R_{Xg}$.\nSo, the total Thevenin resistance for the charging phase is:\n$$\nR_{Th, charge} = R_B + R_{Xg} = R_B + \\frac{R_A R_C}{R_A + R_C}\n$$\nTo simplify, we can write this as a single fraction:\n$$\nR_{Th, charge} = \\frac{R_B(R_A + R_C) + R_A R_C}{R_A + R_C} = \\frac{R_A R_B + R_B R_C + R_A R_C}{R_A + R_C}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discharging Thevenin resistance, $R_{Th, discharge}$.**\nIn the discharging configuration, the voltage source $V_S$ is disconnected, and node X is shorted to ground. We need to find the equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor at node Y.\n\nThe capacitor is connected between node Y and ground. Resistor $R_B$ connects node Y to node X. Since node X is now grounded, the capacitor has a discharge path to ground through resistor $R_B$.\n\nLet's consider the other resistors. Resistor $R_A$ had one end connected to the (now disconnected) source and the other end at node X (ground). Since one end is an open circuit, no current can flow through $R_A$. It is therefore not part of the discharge path for the capacitor. Resistor $R_C$ was connected between node X and ground. Since node X is shorted to ground, both ends of $R_C$ are at ground potential. It is shorted out and no current from the capacitor will flow through it.\n\nTherefore, the only path for the capacitor to discharge to ground is through resistor $R_B$. The Thevenin resistance for the discharging phase is simply:\n$$\nR_{Th, discharge} = R_B\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio $\\gamma$.**\nNow we can compute the ratio using the expressions for $R_{Th, charge}$ and $R_{Th, discharge}$.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{R_{Th, charge}}{R_{Th, discharge}} = \\frac{R_B + \\frac{R_A R_C}{R_A + R_C}}{R_B}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified:\n$$\n\\gamma = 1 + \\frac{R_A R_C}{R_B(R_A + R_C)}\n$$\nAlternatively, using the fractional form of $R_{Th, charge}$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\frac{R_A R_B + R_B R_C + R_A R_C}{R_A + R_C}}{R_B} = \\frac{R_A R_B + R_B R_C + R_A R_C}{R_B(R_A + R_C)}\n$$\nExpanding the denominator gives the final form:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{R_A R_B + R_B R_C + R_A R_C}{R_A R_B + R_B R_C}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_A R_B + R_B R_C + R_A R_C}{R_A R_B + R_B R_C}}$$", "id": "1328021"}]}
