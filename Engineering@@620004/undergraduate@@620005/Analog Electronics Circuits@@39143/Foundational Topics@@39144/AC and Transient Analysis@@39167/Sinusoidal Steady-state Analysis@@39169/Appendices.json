To characterize this component, a test engineer connects it to a sinusoidal voltage source with a variable angular frequency $\\omega$.

It is described as a series combination of an ideal resistor with resistance $R$ and an ideal inductor with inductance $L$.\n\nIn sinusoidal steady-state analysis, we work with complex impedances. The impedance of the resistor, $Z_R$, is purely real and equal to its resistance:\n$$Z_R = R$$\nThe impedance of the inductor, $Z_L$, is purely imaginary and is given by:\n$$Z_L = j\\omega L$$\nwhere $j$ is the imaginary unit (satisfying $j^2 = -1$) and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the applied sinusoidal voltage.\n\nSince the resistor and inductor are connected in series, the total impedance of the circuit, $Z$, is the sum of their individual impedances:\n$$Z = Z_R + Z_L = R + j\\omega L$$\nThis is a complex number with a real part $\\text{Re}(Z) = R$ and an imaginary part $\\text{Im}(Z) = \\omega L$.\n\nThe magnitude of the total impedance, $|Z|$, is found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts:\n$$|Z| = \\sqrt{(\\text{Re}(Z))^2 + (\\text{Im}(Z))^2} = \\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2}$$\n\nThe problem provides a condition that the impedance magnitude must satisfy. Specifically, $|Z|$ must be equal to $\\sqrt{2}$ times the resistance $R$:\n$$|Z| = \\sqrt{2}R$$\n\nNow, we set our expression for the impedance magnitude equal to this condition:\n$$\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2} = \\sqrt{2}R$$\n\nTo solve for $\\omega$, we first square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots. Since both sides are positive, this is a valid step that does not introduce extraneous solutions.\n$$(\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2})^2 = (\\sqrt{2}R)^2$$\n$$R^2 + (\\omega L)^2 = 2R^2$$\n\nNext, we isolate the term containing $\\omega$. We subtract $R^2$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$(\\omega L)^2 = 2R^2 - R^2$$\n$$(\\omega L)^2 = R^2$$\n\nTo find $\\omega L$, we take the square root of both sides. Since angular frequency $\\omega$, inductance $L$, and resistance $R$ are all non-negative physical quantities, we only need to consider the positive root:\n$$\\sqrt{(\\omega L)^2} = \\sqrt{R^2}$$\n$$\\omega L = R$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the angular frequency $\\omega$ by dividing both sides by the inductance $L$:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{R}{L}$$\n\nThis is the angular frequency at which the impedance magnitude of the series RL circuit is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the resistance $R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R}{L}}$$", "id": "1333334"}, {"introduction": "Moving from component characterization to circuit application, this problem tackles a classic engineering challenge: maximizing power transfer in an AC system.
