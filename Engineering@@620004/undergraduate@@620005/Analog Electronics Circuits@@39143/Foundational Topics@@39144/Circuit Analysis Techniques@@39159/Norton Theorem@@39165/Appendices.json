By definition, the Norton parameters are the short-circuit current between A and B, $I_{eq}$, and the equivalent resistance seen at A-B with independent sources deactivated, $R_{eq}$.\n\nFirst, compute the Thévenin voltage $V_{Th}$ at A-B under open-circuit conditions (no external load between A and B). With no external connection at the port, the original loop is unchanged; the loop current is set by the series resistors and the source. By Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law for the single-loop series circuit,\n$$\nI_{\\text{loop}}=\\frac{V_{S}}{R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}}.\n$$\nThe open-circuit voltage between A and B is the drop across $R_{2}$ in the direction from A to B:\n$$\nV_{Th}=V_{AB\\text{ (oc)}}=I_{\\text{loop}}\\,R_{2}=\\frac{V_{S}R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}}.\n$$\n\nNext, compute the equivalent resistance $R_{eq}=R_{Th}$ seen at A-B with the independent source deactivated. Deactivating the ideal voltage source $V_{S}$ means replacing it by its internal resistance, which for an ideal source is a short circuit. The resulting network has $R_{1}$ from A to the source node (ground), $R_{3}$ from B to ground, and $R_{2}$ directly between A and B. Thus, between A and B there are two parallel paths: the direct $R_{2}$, and the series path $R_{1}+R_{3}$ through ground.
