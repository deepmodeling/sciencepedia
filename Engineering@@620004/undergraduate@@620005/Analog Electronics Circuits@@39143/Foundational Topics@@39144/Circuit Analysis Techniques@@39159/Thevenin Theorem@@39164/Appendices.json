A Thevenin equivalent circuit consists of a Thevenin voltage source, $V_{th}$, in series with a Thevenin resistance, $R_{th}$. We will calculate these two quantities separately.\n\nFirst, we determine the Thevenin voltage, $V_{th}$. The Thevenin voltage is defined as the open-circuit voltage across the output terminals A and B. In this circuit, terminal A is connected to node X and terminal B is connected to ground. Therefore, $V_{th} = V_{AB} = V_A - V_B = V_X - 0 = V_X$. To find the voltage at node X, we can apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at this node. KCL states that the sum of currents leaving a node is zero.\n\nThe current leaving node X through resistor $R_1$ is $\\frac{V_X - V_S}{R_1}$.\nThe current leaving node X through resistor $R_2$ is $\\frac{V_X}{R_2}$.\nThe current leaving node X due to the current source is $I_S$.\n\nThe KCL equation at node X is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_X - V_S}{R_1} + \\frac{V_X}{R_2} + I_S = 0\n$$\nOur goal is to solve for $V_X$, which is equal to $V_{th}$.

This is the equivalent resistance seen from terminals A and B when all independent sources are turned off (deactivated). A voltage source is turned off by replacing it with a short circuit (a wire), and a current source is turned off by replacing it with an open circuit.\n\nDeactivating the sources in our circuit means:\n1. The voltage source $V_S$ is replaced by a wire connecting its positive terminal to ground.\n2. The current source $I_S$ is removed, creating an open circuit.\n\nAfter deactivating the sources, resistor $R_1$ is connected between node X and ground. Resistor $R_2$ is already connected between node X and ground.
