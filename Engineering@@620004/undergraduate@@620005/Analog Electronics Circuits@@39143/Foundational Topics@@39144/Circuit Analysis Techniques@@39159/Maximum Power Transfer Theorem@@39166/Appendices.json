Express your answer in Ohms ($\\Omega$), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "To find the load resistance $R_L$ that absorbs maximum power, we must invoke the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem. This theorem states that for a DC circuit, maximum power is delivered to a resistive load when the load resistance $R_L$ is equal to the Thevenin equivalent resistance $R_{Th}$ of the circuit as seen from the load's terminals (A and B).\n\nOur task is therefore to calculate the Thevenin resistance, $R_{Th}$, of the provided circuit looking into terminals A and B. Since the circuit contains a dependent source, we cannot simply find the equivalent resistance by combining resistors after deactivating the independent sources. Instead, we must use a more general method, such as applying a test source at the terminals.\n\nLet's apply a test voltage source, $V_{test}$, across terminals A and B, with the positive terminal at A and the negative terminal at B (ground). We will then calculate the current, $I_{test}$, that flows out of the positive terminal of this test source. The Thevenin resistance will be given by the ratio $R_{Th} = V_{test} / I_{test}$.\n\nWhen finding the Thevenin resistance, all independent sources in the original circuit must be deactivated. This means the independent voltage source $V_S$ is replaced by a short circuit (a wire), and any independent current sources would be replaced by an open circuit. In our circuit, deactivating $V_S$ connects node C directly to node D.\n\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{Th}$ is as follows:\n- A test voltage $V_{test}$ is applied across A and B. Since B is ground, the voltage at node A is $v_A = V_{test}$.\n- Resistor $R_1$ connects node A to node C.\n- Resistor $R_2$ connects node C to terminal B (ground).\n- Since $V_S$ is a short, node D is the same as node C. The dependent current source $g \\cdot i_x$ is connected between D and B, which is now between C and B. The current flows from C to B.\n- The controlling current $i_x$ is the current through $R_2$ from C to B. By Ohm's law, with $v_B = 0$, the voltage at node C, $v_C$, determines this current: $i_x = v_C / R_2$.\n- The dependent source current is therefore $g \\cdot i_x = g(v_C/R_2)$.\n\nWe can find the relationship between $V_{test}$ and $I_{test}$ by applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node C. The sum of currents leaving node C must be zero.\n\nThe currents leaving node C are:\n1.  Current through $R_1$ towards A: $\\frac{v_C - v_A}{R_1} = \\frac{v_C - V_{test}}{R_1}$.\n2.  Current through $R_2$ towards B: $\\frac{v_C}{R_2}$. This is $i_x$.\n3.
