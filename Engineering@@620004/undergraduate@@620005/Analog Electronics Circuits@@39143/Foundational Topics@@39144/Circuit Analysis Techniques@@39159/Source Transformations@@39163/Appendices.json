A Norton equivalent circuit consists of an independent current source $I_N$ in parallel with an equivalent resistance $R_N$. The parameters $I_N$ and $R_N$ can be determined by finding the short-circuit current ($I_{sc}$) and the open-circuit voltage ($V_{oc}$) at the network's terminals. The Norton current is equal to the short-circuit current, $I_N = I_{sc}$. The Norton resistance is given by the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the short-circuit current, $R_N = V_{oc} / I_{sc}$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Norton Current ($I_N = I_{sc}$)**\n\nTo find the short-circuit current $I_{sc}$, we connect a wire between terminals A and B, which forces the voltage across them to be zero, i.e., $V_{AB} = 0$.\nThe total current $I_{sc}$ flowing through this short is the sum of the currents from the two parallel branches of the circuit, according to Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL).
