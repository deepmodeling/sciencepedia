The VCCS is defined by the relation $i_{out} = g_m v_c$, where $i_{out}$ is the current produced by the source, $g_m$ is its transconductance, and $v_c$ is the voltage across the resistor $R_c$.

According to the maximum power transfer theorem, this occurs when the load resistance $R_L$ is equal to the Thevenin equivalent resistance $R_{th}$ of the source circuit as seen from terminals A and B. The maximum power is then given by $P_{max} = \\frac{V_{th}^2}{4 R_{th}}$, where $V_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent voltage.\n\nOur first step is to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the network connected to $R_L$.\n\nTo find the Thevenin voltage $V_{th}$, we calculate the open-circuit voltage across terminals A and B. Let's denote the voltage at terminal A with respect to terminal B (ground) as $v_{AB}$. With the load $R_L$ disconnected (open circuit), we have $V_{th} = v_{AB, oc}$.\nIn this open-circuit condition, the voltage across the controlling resistor $R_c$ is $v_c = v_{AB, oc}$. Therefore, the current from the VCCS is $i_{out} = g_m v_{AB, oc}$.\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node A.

To do this, we deactivate all independent sources in the circuit (the voltage source $V_s$ becomes a short circuit) and find the equivalent resistance seen from terminals A and B. Since the circuit contains a dependent source, we apply a test voltage source $V_t$ across terminals A and B and calculate the resulting current $I_t$ flowing from the test source.

The current from the VCCS is $i_{out} = g_m V_t$.\nWe apply KCL at node A.
