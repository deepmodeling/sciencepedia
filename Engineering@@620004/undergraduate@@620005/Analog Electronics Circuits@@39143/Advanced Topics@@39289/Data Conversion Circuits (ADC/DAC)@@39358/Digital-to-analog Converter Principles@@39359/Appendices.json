Consider a 4-bit R-2R ladder network designed to produce an output voltage. The circuit is structured as follows:\n\nA main horizontal line of resistors, each with resistance $R$, connects a series of nodes. Let the nodes be labeled $N_3, N_2, N_1, N_0$ from left to right. The output voltage, $V_{out}$, is the voltage at the leftmost node, $N_3$. From each node $N_i$ (for $i=3, 2, 1, 0$), there is a vertical shunt resistor of value $2R$ connected to a corresponding digital voltage input, $V_{b_i}$.
