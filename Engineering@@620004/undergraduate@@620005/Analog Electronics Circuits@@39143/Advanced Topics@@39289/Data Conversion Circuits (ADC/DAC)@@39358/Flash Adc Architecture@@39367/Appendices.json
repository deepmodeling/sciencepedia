This first practice explores the direct consequence of this design: the relationship between the desired resolution, measured in bits ($n$), and the required number of core components.

A key component of this design is a flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which is selected for its extremely high sampling rate. A flash ADC architecture operates by simultaneously comparing the input analog voltage against a set of unique reference voltages. These reference voltages are generated by a precision resistor ladder network, and the outputs of all the comparators are fed into a priority encoder to generate the final binary code.\n\nThe design specification for the oscilloscope requires a vertical resolution corresponding to that of a 5-bit ADC. To estimate the required circuit complexity and component count, the engineer needs to determine the number of core analog building blocks. Assuming an ideal flash ADC architecture, what is the sum of the total number of comparators and the total number of resistors in the voltage divider ladder required for this 5-bit system?", "solution": "The problem asks for the total count of two key components in a 5-bit flash ADC: the comparators and the resistors in the voltage divider ladder. We will calculate the number of each component separately and then sum them.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the general architecture of an $n$-bit flash ADC. An $n$-bit ADC is designed to quantize an analog input into $2^n$ discrete digital levels.\n\nThe core of a flash ADC consists of a series of comparators. Each comparator checks if the input analog voltage, $V_{in}$, is higher or lower than a specific reference voltage, $V_{ref,i}$. To distinguish between $2^n$ different levels, we need to define the boundaries between them. There are $2^n - 1$ such boundaries. For example, for a 2-bit ADC ($n=2$), there are $2^2 = 4$ levels (e.g., 00, 01, 10, 11). To define these four regions, we need three threshold voltages, which in turn require three comparators. Generalizing this, for an $n$-bit resolution, the number of comparators, $N_{comp}$, is given by:\n$$N_{comp} = 2^n - 1$$\n\nNext, we consider the resistor ladder network. This network's purpose is to generate the $2^n - 1$ unique reference voltages required by the comparators. The most common implementation uses a series of identical resistors connected between a main reference voltage, $V_{ref}$, and ground. A chain of $k$ identical resistors will have $k-1$ nodes (taps) between them, providing $k-1$ distinct voltage levels. To obtain the required $2^n - 1$ reference voltages for the comparators, the resistor ladder must therefore consist of a total of $N_{res}$ resistors, where:\n$$N_{res} = 2^n$$\nThis configuration of $2^n$ resistors creates the necessary $2^n-1$ intermediate voltage taps.\n\nIn this specific problem, the ADC has a resolution of 5 bits, so we set $n=5$.\n\nNow we can calculate the number of comparators:\n$$N_{comp} = 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31$$\n\nAnd the number of resistors in the ladder:\n$$N_{res} = 2^5 = 32$$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the total number of comparators and the total number of resistors. Let this sum be $N_{total}$.\n$$N_{total} = N_{comp} + N_{res}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$N_{total} = 31 + 32 = 63$$\n\nThus, the sum of the number of comparators and resistors required is 63.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63}$$", "id": "1304638"}, {"introduction": "Once the analog input has been simultaneously compared against all reference voltages, the flash ADC must translate this parallel information into a single binary number. This task is handled by a priority encoder, which processes the 'thermometer code' from the comparator bank. This exercise focuses on the encoder's logic, challenging you to determine the final digital output based on a given set of comparator states, thus solidifying your understanding of the data-encoding step in the conversion process [@problem_id:1304590].", "problem": "A 3-bit flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is being designed. This type of ADC uses a voltage divider and a bank of comparators to directly digitize an analog input voltage, $V_{in}$. For an $n$-bit converter, $2^n - 1$ comparators are required. In this 3-bit design, seven comparators, indexed $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_7$, are used. Each comparator $C_k$ compares $V_{in}$ to a unique reference voltage $V_{ref,k}$, where $V_{ref,1} < V_{ref,2} < \\dots < V_{ref,7}$. The output of each comparator $C_k$ is a single bit: '1' if $V_{in} > V_{ref,k}$ and '0' otherwise.\n\nThe seven outputs from the comparators are fed into a priority encoder. The function of this priority encoder is to identify the largest index $k$ for which the comparator output $C_k$ is '1', and then to generate the 3-bit binary representation of that index $k$. If all comparator outputs are '0', the encoder outputs `000`.\n\nAt a specific moment in time, the 7-bit output from the bank of comparators is measured.
