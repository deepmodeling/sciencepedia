The system uses an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to convert a sensor's voltage output into a digital format. The ADC is configured to have a resolution of 4 bits and accepts an input voltage range from 0 V to 8 V, inclusive. The output of the ADC is an unsigned binary number. At a certain point during the experiment, the analog input voltage from the sensor is measured to be a constant 6.2 V.
