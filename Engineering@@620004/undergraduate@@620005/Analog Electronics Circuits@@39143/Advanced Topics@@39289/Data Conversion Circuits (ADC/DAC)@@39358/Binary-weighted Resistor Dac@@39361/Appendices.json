The feedback resistor of the operational amplifier, $R_f$, is set to be equal to the base resistor $R$, i.e., $R_f = R$. The digital inputs control switches. A digital '1' connects the corresponding resistor to a reference voltage, $V_{ref}$, while a digital '0' connects it to ground (0 V). The reference voltage is given as $V_{ref} = 2.56$ V.
