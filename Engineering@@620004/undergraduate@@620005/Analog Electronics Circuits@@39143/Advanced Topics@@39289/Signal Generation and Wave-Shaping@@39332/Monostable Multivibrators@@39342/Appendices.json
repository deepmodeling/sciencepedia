Initially, an internal discharge transistor keeps the external timing capacitor, with capacitance $C$, fully discharged (0 V).\n2.

The timing of the output pulse is determined by an external resistor $R$ and a capacitor $C$. In a standard configuration, the pulse width is found to be proportional to the product $RC$.\n\nConsider a modification to this standard circuit where an ideal silicon diode is placed in series with the timing resistor $R$. When forward-biased, this diode exhibits a constant voltage drop of $V_D$. The charging path for the capacitor $C$ now runs from the supply $V_{CC}$ through the series combination of the resistor $R$ and the diode.\n\nThe monostable timing cycle begins at $t=0$ when an external trigger is applied, at which point the capacitor voltage is 0 V.

Therefore, the initial voltage is:\n$$V_{initial} = v_C(0) = 0$$\n\nNext, we identify the time constant $\\tau$. The charging path consists of the resistor $R$ and the capacitor $C$. The problem states we use an ideal silicon diode, which in its forward-biased state is assumed to have zero dynamic resistance. Thus, the diode's presence does not alter the resistance in the charging path, and the time constant remains:\n$$\\tau = RC$$\n\nNow, we determine the final voltage, $V_{final}$. The capacitor charges through the resistor $R$ and the diode, which are connected to the supply voltage $V_{CC}$.
