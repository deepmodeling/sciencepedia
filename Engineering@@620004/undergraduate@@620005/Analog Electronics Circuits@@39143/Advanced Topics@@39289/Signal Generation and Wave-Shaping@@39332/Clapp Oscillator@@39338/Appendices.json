In this configuration, the tank circuit consists of three parallel branches: one with capacitor $C_1$, one with capacitor $C_2$, and one with the series combination of inductor $L$ and capacitor $C_3$.\n\nFor a parallel resonant circuit, the condition for resonance is that the total admittance $Y_T$ has zero imaginary part (i.e., the total susceptance $B_T$ is zero). The total admittance is the sum of the admittances of the parallel branches.\n\nThe admittance of the first capacitor is $Y_1 = j\\omega C_1$.\nThe admittance of the second capacitor is $Y_2 = j\\omega C_2$.\nThe impedance of the third branch (series L and $C_3$) is $Z_3 = j\\omega L + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_3} = j(\\omega L - \\frac{1}{\\omega C_3})$.\nThe admittance of the third branch is therefore $Y_3 = \\frac{1}{Z_3} = \\frac{1}{j(\\omega L - \\frac{1}{\\omega C_3})} = -j \\frac{1}{\\omega L - \\frac{1}{\\omega C_3}} = j \\frac{\\omega C_3}{1 - \\omega^2 L C_3}$.\n\nThe total admittance of the tank circuit is $Y_T = Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 = j\\omega C_1 + j\\omega C_2 + j \\frac{\\omega C_3}{1 - \\omega^2 L C_3}$.\nAt the oscillation frequency $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0$, the imaginary part of $Y_T$ must be zero.
