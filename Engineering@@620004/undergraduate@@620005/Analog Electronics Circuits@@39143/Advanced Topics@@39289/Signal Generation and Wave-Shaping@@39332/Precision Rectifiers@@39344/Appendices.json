The circuit is configured as a non-inverting precision half-wave rectifier. The configuration is as follows: The input voltage signal, $v_{in}(t)$, is connected to the non-inverting (+) terminal of the op-amp. The output of the op-amp is connected to the anode of the ideal diode. The cathode of this diode serves as the circuit's main output terminal, which has a voltage $v_{out}(t)$.

When the diode conducts, the negative feedback loop is closed, so the ideal op-amp enforces $v_{-}=v_{+}$. The inverting input is tied directly to the main output node; hence when the diode is on, $v_{out}(t)=v_{-}(t)=v_{+}(t)=v_{in}(t)$. The diode conduction implies the op-amp output equals the main output because the diode has zero forward drop.\n\nWhen the input would demand a negative output, the op-amp output must go below the output node to drive $v_{out}$ negative. That reverse-biases the diode (anode below cathode), opening the feedback path. With the diode open, the op-amp cannot drive the output node negative, and the precision rectifier ideal behavior is $v_{out}(t)=0$ in this interval.

You will investigate how this leakage affects the output during the intended 'off' cycle, revealing why a real precision rectifier does not produce a perfect zero-volt output and how to quantify this error using op-amp saturation and voltage division principles.", "problem": "A precision rectifier circuit is constructed using an operational amplifier (op-amp), which can be considered ideal except for its output voltage being limited by saturation rails at $+V_{sat}$ and $-V_{sat}$. The input signal, $v_{in}$, is connected to the non-inverting (+) terminal of the op-amp. The op-amp's output terminal is connected to the anode of a faulty diode, $D$. The cathode of this diode is designated as the circuit's output node, $v_{out}$. A feedback path is established by connecting the output node $v_{out}$ directly to the inverting (-) terminal of the op-amp. Finally, a load resistor, $R_{load}$, is connected between the output node $v_{out}$ and ground.\n\nThe diode $D$ is known to be faulty, exhibiting a reverse leakage current.

At this instant, $v_{in}$ is equal to $-4.0 \\, \\text{V}$. Express your answer in millivolts (mV), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the output voltage $v_{out}$ of a precision rectifier circuit during its ideally non-conducting cycle. We are given the input voltage at this instant is $v_{in} = -4.0 \\, \\text{V}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the state of the operational amplifier (op-amp). The input voltage $v_{in}$ is applied to the non-inverting terminal (+), so $v_{+} = v_{in} = -4.0 \\, \\text{V}$. The inverting terminal (-) is connected to the output, so $v_{-} = v_{out}$. The op-amp's function in a negative feedback configuration is to adjust its output, $v_{op}$, to make $v_{-} = v_{+}$. Therefore, the op-amp attempts to set $v_{out} = -4.0 \\, \\text{V}$.\n\nTo achieve a negative output voltage $v_{out}$, the op-amp's own output, $v_{op}$, which is connected to the anode of the diode $D$, must be even more negative (to overcome the diode's forward voltage drop). A negative voltage at the anode of the diode relative to its cathode ($v_{out}$) will cause the ideal diode part of our model to be reverse-biased.\n\nWhen the ideal diode is reverse-biased, it behaves as an open circuit. This action breaks the negative feedback loop that would normally connect the op-amp's output to its inverting terminal via the diode. When an ideal op-amp's negative feedback loop is open, it behaves as a high-gain comparator. Its output will swing to one of its saturation rails.\n\nThe differential input voltage to the op-amp is $v_d = v_{+} - v_{-}$. At the moment the loop opens, $v_{+} = v_{in}$ and $v_{-}$ is an output voltage that was previously positive or zero. As $v_{in}$ becomes negative, $v_d$ becomes negative. With a negative differential input ($v_d < 0$), the op-amp's output voltage, $v_{op}$, will saturate at its negative rail. Therefore, $v_{op} = -V_{sat}$.\n\nNow we can analyze the output part of the circuit. The op-amp's output terminal acts as a voltage source with a value of $-V_{sat}$. This voltage source is connected to the output node $v_{out}$ through the leakage resistance $R_L$ (since the ideal diode part is an open circuit). The output node $v_{out}$ is also connected to ground through the load resistor $R_{load}$.\n\nThe output voltage $v_{out}$ can be found using the voltage divider rule. The node $v_{out}$ is between two resistors, $R_L$ and $R_{load}$, which are connected between a voltage of $-V_{sat}$ and ground (0 V). The formula for the voltage divider is:\n$$v_{out} = (-V_{sat}) \\frac{R_{load}}{R_{load} + R_L}$$\nNote that the value of $v_{in}$ caused the op-amp to saturate, but once saturated, the exact value of $v_{in}$ does not affect the output voltage, which is determined solely by $V_{sat}$, $R_{load}$, and $R_L$.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$V_{sat} = 12.0 \\, \\text{V}$\n$R_{load} = 10.0 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega = 10.0 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\Omega$\n$R_L = 2.00 \\, \\text{M}\\Omega = 2.00 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\Omega$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $v_{out}$:\n$$v_{out} = -12.0 \\, \\text{V} \\times \\frac{10.0 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\Omega}{10.0 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\Omega + 2.00 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\Omega}$$\n$$v_{out} = -12.0 \\, \\text{V} \\times \\frac{10.0 \\times 10^{3}}{2010 \\times 10^{3}}$$\n$$v_{out} = -12.0 \\, \\text{V} \\times \\frac{10.0}{2010}$$\n$$v_{out} \\approx -12.0 \\times 0.004975124$$\n$$v_{out} \\approx -0.05970149 \\, \\text{V}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in millivolts (mV).
