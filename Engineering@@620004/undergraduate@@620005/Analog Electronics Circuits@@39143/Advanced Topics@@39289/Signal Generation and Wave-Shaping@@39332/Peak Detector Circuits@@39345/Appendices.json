The capacitor $C$ is charged to the peak voltage of the input signal, $V_p$, through the ideal diode. Once the input voltage $v_{in}(t)$ drops below the voltage across the capacitor, the ideal diode becomes reverse-biased and acts as an open circuit. At this point, the capacitor begins to discharge through the load resistor $R_L$. This discharge continues until the next positive peak of the input signal recharges the capacitor to $V_p$. The ripple voltage is the amount the capacitor voltage decays during this discharge period.\n\nThe voltage across a discharging capacitor as a function of time $t$ is given by the equation:\n$$v_{out}(t) = V_{start} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nHere, the discharge starts from the peak voltage, so $V_{start} = V_p$. The time constant of the discharge circuit is $\\tau = R_L C$. Thus, the output voltage during the discharge phase is:\n$$v_{out}(t) = V_p \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_L C}\\right)$$\nThe duration of the discharge is approximately the period of the input sinusoidal signal, $T$. The period is the inverse of the frequency, $f$:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{f}$$\nThe voltage at the end of the discharge period, just before the next charging cycle begins, is $v_{out}(T)$.\n$$v_{out}(T) = V_p \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{R_L C}\\right)$$\nThe peak-to-peak ripple voltage, $\\Delta V_{out}$, is the difference between the maximum voltage ($V_p$) and the minimum voltage ($v_{out}(T)$) during one cycle.\n$$\\Delta V_{out} = V_p - v_{out}(T) = V_p - V_p \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{R_L C}\\right) = V_p \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{R_L C}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe problem states that we can use an approximation based on the a sufficiently high input frequency. This implies that the period $T$ is much smaller than the time constant $\\tau = R_L C$, i.e., $T \\ll R_L C$.
