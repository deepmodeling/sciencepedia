Let's analyze the implications of this condition step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of phase margin (PM). The phase margin is a measure of the system's relative stability. It is calculated from the open-loop transfer function, $L(s)$. We first find the gain crossover frequency, $\\omega_{gc}$, which is the frequency at which the magnitude of the open-loop frequency response is unity: $|L(j\\omega_{gc})| = 1$. The phase margin is then defined as $PM = 180^\\circ + \\phi_{gc}$, where $\\phi_{gc}$ is the phase angle of $L(j\\omega_{gc})$. That is, $\\phi_{gc} = \\angle L(j\\omega_{gc})$.\n\nThe problem states that the phase margin is exactly $0^\\circ$. Using the definition, this means:\n$$0^\\circ = 180^\\circ + \\angle L(j\\omega_{gc})$$\nThis implies that the phase angle of the open-loop transfer function at the gain crossover frequency is exactly $-180^\\circ$:\n$$\\angle L(j\\omega_{gc}) = -180^\\circ$$\nSo, at the frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{gc}$, we have both $|L(j\\omega_{gc})|=1$ and $\\angle L(j\\omega_{gc}) = -180^\\circ$. Written in polar form, this means $L(j\\omega_{gc}) = 1 \\angle -180^\\circ = -1$.\n\nThe behavior of the closed-loop system is determined by the poles of its closed-loop transfer function, $T(s)$. For a unity-feedback system, $T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}$. The poles of $T(s)$ are the roots of the characteristic equation: $1 + L(s) = 0$.\n\nFrom our finding that $L(j\\omega_{gc}) = -1$, we can see that $1 + L(j\\omega_{gc}) = 0$. This means that $s = j\\omega_{gc}$ is a root of the characteristic equation. Since all coefficients of the polynomial $1+L(s)$ are real (because $K, p_1, p_2$ are real), if $j\\omega_{gc}$ is a root, its complex conjugate, $-j\\omega_{gc}$, must also be a root.\n\nTherefore, the closed-loop system has a pair of poles located purely on the imaginary axis at $s = \\pm j\\omega_{gc}$. The given open-loop system is of third order, so the characteristic equation $1+L(s)=0$ will be a third-degree polynomial. It will have three roots (poles). The third pole must lie on the real axis in the left-half plane for the system to be stable before this critical gain setting. The presence of poles on the imaginary axis (and no poles in the right-half plane) signifies that the system is marginally stable.\n\nNow, let's consider the system's response to a unit step input, $u(t)$, whose Laplace transform is $U(s) = 1/s$. The output in the Laplace domain is $Y(s) = T(s)U(s)$. The poles of $Y(s)$ are the poles of $T(s)$ plus the pole from the input at $s=0$.\nThe partial fraction expansion of $Y(s)$ will include terms corresponding to each of these poles. The poles at $s=\\pm j\\omega_{gc}$ will contribute a term of the form $\\frac{A s + B}{s^2 + \\omega_{gc}^2}$ which corresponds to a sustained sinusoidal oscillation $C \\cos(\\omega_{gc} t + \\phi)$ in the time domain. The other pole(s) of $T(s)$ are in the left-half plane, contributing terms that decay to zero as $t \\to \\infty$. The pole at $s=0$ from the step input contributes a term $\\frac{D}{s}$, which corresponds to a constant DC offset $D$ in the time domain.\n\nTo find this constant offset, we can evaluate the residue at the $s=0$ pole. This corresponds to the final steady-state value around which the oscillations occur.\nThe DC value is given by $D = \\lim_{s\\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s T(s) \\frac{1}{s} = T(0)$.\nLet's find $T(0)$:\n$$T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)} = \\frac{\\frac{K}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)}}{1+\\frac{K}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)}} = \\frac{K}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)+K}$$\nEvaluating at $s=0$:\n$$T(0) = \\frac{K}{0(0+p_1)(0+p_2)+K} = \\frac{K}{K} = 1$$\nSo, the oscillations are centered around a constant value of 1.\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the decaying terms vanish, and the response becomes a sustained oscillation around the value 1.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The response converges without oscillations. This describes an overdamped or critically damped system, which requires all poles to be real and in the left-half plane. This is incorrect.\nB. The response has decaying oscillations. This describes an underdamped stable system, which requires complex conjugate poles in the left-half plane (not on the imaginary axis). This corresponds to a positive phase margin ($PM>0$). This is incorrect.\nC. The response grows without bound. This describes an unstable system, which has poles in the right-half plane. This corresponds to a negative phase margin ($PM<0$). This is incorrect.\nD. The response has sustained, undamped oscillations about a constant non-zero value. This perfectly matches our analysis of a marginally stable system with a DC offset of 1. This is correct.\nE. The response oscillates indefinitely about zero. This is incorrect because the steady-state DC value is 1, not 0.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1307119"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing existing systems, a primary engineering task is to design systems that meet performance specifications, with stability margins serving as key design targets for robust operation.
