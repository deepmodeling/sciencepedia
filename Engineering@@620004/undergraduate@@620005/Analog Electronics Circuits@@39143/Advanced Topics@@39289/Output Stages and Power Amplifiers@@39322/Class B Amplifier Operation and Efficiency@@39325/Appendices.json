Due to a parts mix-up, they construct the circuit using two identical NPN Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), labeled $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, instead of the intended complementary NPN/PNP pair.\n\nThe circuit is configured as follows:\n- A sinusoidal input signal, $v_{in}(t) = V_p \\sin(\\omega t)$, is applied simultaneously to the bases of both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. The peak amplitude of the input is $V_p = 5.0 \\text{ V}$.\n- The collector of the 'push' transistor, $Q_1$, is connected to a positive DC voltage supply, $+V_{CC} = 15 \\text{ V}$.\n- The collector of the 'pull' transistor, $Q_2$, is connected to a negative DC voltage supply, $-V_{EE} = -15 \\text{ V}$.\n- The emitters of both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are connected together. This common node is the amplifier's output, $v_{out}$, which drives a load resistor, $R_L$, connected to ground.\n\nAssume the NPN transistors can be modeled by the following simplified rules:\n1. A transistor will turn on and conduct current from collector to emitter only if its base-emitter voltage, $v_{BE}$, is greater than or equal to the turn-on voltage, $V_{BE(on)}$.\n2.

Furthermore, the devices are assumed to conduct only from collector to emitter and not in the reverse direction.\n\n- For $Q_{1}$ (collector at $+V_{CC}$): when on, it sources current to the output node and enforces $v_{out}=v_{b}-V_{BE(on)}$.\n- For $Q_{2}$ (collector at $-V_{EE}$): by the given rule 3, it can only inject current from its collector into the emitter node (collector-to-emitter direction). Thus it cannot sink current from the output node into the negative supply; it also enforces $v_{out}=v_{b}-V_{BE(on)}$ only when that value is nonnegative, because making $v_{out}<0$ would require sinking current from the node, which this simplified NPN model cannot do.\n\nTherefore, the output is\n$$\nv_{out}(t)=\\max\\big(0,\\;V_{p}\\sin(\\omega t)-V_{BE(on)}\\big).\n$$\nDefine $\\theta=\\omega t$ and let $\\theta_{0}=\\arcsin\\!\\big(V_{BE(on)}/V_{p}\\big)\\in(0,\\pi/2)$.
