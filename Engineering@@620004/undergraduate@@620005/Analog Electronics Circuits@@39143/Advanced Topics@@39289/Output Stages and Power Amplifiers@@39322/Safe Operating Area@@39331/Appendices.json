This often occurs at the point of maximum power dissipation. This exercise [@problem_id:1329590] introduces the concept of the DC load line and challenges you to determine the operating point where the transistor experiences the greatest thermal stress, a crucial skill for designing reliable amplifier and switching circuits.", "problem": "A design engineer is analyzing a simple common-emitter amplifier circuit that uses an NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). The circuit is powered by a single DC voltage supply, $V_{CC}$, and has a resistor, $R_C$, connected between the supply and the transistor's collector terminal. The emitter is connected directly to the ground reference.\n\nIn this configuration, the possible DC operating points $(V_{CE}, I_C)$, where $V_{CE}$ is the collector-emitter voltage and $I_C$ is the collector current, are all located on a straight line on the $I_C$ vs. $V_{CE}$ plot. This line is known as the DC load line. The power dissipated by the transistor itself is given by the product $P_D = V_{CE} \\cdot I_C$. To select an appropriate transistor that can handle the thermal load, the engineer must determine the maximum possible power dissipation it might experience.\n\nGiven a supply voltage of $V_{CC} = 15.0\\,\\text{V}$ and a collector resistance of $R_C = 250\\,\\Omega$, calculate the maximum instantaneous power the transistor will dissipate, assuming its operating point can be set anywhere along the DC load line.\n\nExpress your answer in watts (W), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum power dissipated by the BJT, $P_D$, when its operating point $(V_{CE}, I_C)$ is constrained to lie on the DC load line of a common-emitter circuit.\n\nFirst, we must establish the equation for the DC load line. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the collector-emitter loop of the circuit, we start at the supply voltage $V_{CC}$, go through the collector resistor $R_C$, and then across the transistor from collector to emitter. This gives the relationship:\n$$V_{CC} = I_C R_C + V_{CE}$$\nThis equation defines the DC load line. It represents the constraint on the possible values of $I_C$ and $V_{CE}$.\n\nThe power dissipated by the transistor, $P_D$, is the product of the voltage across it ($V_{CE}$) and the current through it ($I_C$):\n$$P_D = V_{CE} I_C$$\n\nOur goal is to maximize this function $P_D$ subject to the constraint of the load line equation. To do this, we can express $P_D$ as a function of a single variable, either $V_{CE}$ or $I_C$. Let's express it in terms of $V_{CE}$. From the load line equation, we can solve for $I_C$:\n$$I_C = \\frac{V_{CC} - V_{CE}}{R_C}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $I_C$ into the power dissipation equation:\n$$P_D(V_{CE}) = V_{CE} \\left( \\frac{V_{CC} - V_{CE}}{R_C} \\right)$$\n$$P_D(V_{CE}) = \\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC}V_{CE} - V_{CE}^2)$$\nThis equation describes the transistor's power dissipation as a quadratic function of $V_{CE}$. The function is a downward-opening parabola (due to the $-V_{CE}^2$ term), which means it has a single maximum value.\n\nTo find the value of $V_{CE}$ that maximizes $P_D$, we take the derivative of $P_D(V_{CE})$ with respect to $V_{CE}$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dP_D}{dV_{CE}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{CE}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC}V_{CE} - V_{CE}^2) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dP_D}{dV_{CE}} = \\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC} - 2V_{CE})$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the extremum:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC} - 2V_{CE}) = 0$$\nSince $R_C \\neq 0$, this implies:\n$$V_{CC} - 2V_{CE} = 0$$\n$$V_{CE} = \\frac{V_{CC}}{2}$$\nThis is the collector-emitter voltage at which the power dissipation is maximum. This result is general for a resistive load line.\n\nNow we can find the maximum power, $P_{D,max}$. We can first find the corresponding current $I_C$ by substituting $V_{CE} = V_{CC}/2$ back into the load line equation:\n$$I_C = \\frac{V_{CC} - (V_{CC}/2)}{R_C} = \\frac{V_{CC}/2}{R_C} = \\frac{V_{CC}}{2R_C}$$\nThen, the maximum power is:\n$$P_{D,max} = V_{CE} \\cdot I_C = \\left(\\frac{V_{CC}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{V_{CC}}{2R_C}\\right) = \\frac{V_{CC}^2}{4R_C}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values: $V_{CC} = 15.0\\,\\text{V}$ and $R_C = 250\\,\\Omega$.\n$$P_{D,max} = \\frac{(15.0\\,\\text{V})^2}{4 \\cdot (250\\,\\Omega)} = \\frac{225\\,\\text{V}^2}{1000\\,\\Omega}$$\n$$P_{D,max} = 0.225\\,\\text{W}$$\nThe value is already expressed to three significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.225}$$", "id": "1329590"}, {"introduction": "A transistor's power dissipation limit is fundamentally tied to its ability to shed heat into the environment.
