The design leverages the power dissipated by a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) itself to act as the heating element. The circuit uses a simple fixed-bias configuration with an NPN BJT. In this configuration, the emitter is connected directly to the ground reference. The collector is connected to a DC voltage supply, $V_{CC}$, through a collector resistor, $R_C$.

We can find a relationship between $V_{CE}$ and $I_C$ by applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the collector-emitter loop of the circuit. The loop consists of the voltage supply $V_{CC}$, the collector resistor $R_C$, and the collector-emitter junction of the transistor.\n$$V_{CC} = I_C R_C + V_{CE}$$\nSolving for $V_{CE}$, we get:\n$$V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_C R_C$$\n\nNow we substitute this expression for $V_{CE}$ into the power dissipation equation:\n$$P_D(I_C) = (V_{CC} - I_C R_C) I_C = V_{CC} I_C - I_C^2 R_C$$\n\nThis equation shows that the power dissipation $P_D$ is a quadratic function of the collector current $I_C$.
