The goal is to buffer and amplify the video signal before it is fed into an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Due to the high bandwidth requirements of the video signal, a Current-Feedback Amplifier (CFA) is selected for the design.\n\nThe CFA is configured as a non-inverting voltage amplifier. The feedback network is composed of a feedback resistor, $R_f$, connected from the output to the inverting input, and a gain-setting resistor, $R_g$, connected from the inverting input to ground.

Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the closed-loop voltage gain, $A_v = v_{out} / v_{in}$, of a non-inverting Current-Feedback Amplifier (CFA). We will use the ideal model of the CFA as described in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationships based on the ideal CFA model in a non-inverting configuration.\n1. The input signal $v_{in}$ is applied to the high-impedance non-inverting input terminal (+). Thus, the voltage at this terminal is $v_{+} = v_{in}$.\n2. The internal unity-gain buffer of the CFA ensures that the voltage at the inverting input terminal (-) tracks the voltage at the non-inverting terminal. Therefore, $v_{-} = v_{+} = v_{in}$.\n3. The inverting input is the output of this buffer and acts as a low-impedance node. The current, let's call it $i_{-}$, which flows from this node into the main amplifier's transimpedance stage, determines the output voltage.\n4. The relationship between this current and the output voltage is given by the open-loop transimpedance gain, $Z_T$. That is, $v_{out} = Z_T i_{-}$. In the ideal case, $Z_T \\to \\infty$.\n\nNow, we apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the inverting input node, $v_{-}$. The current $i_{-}$ is the net current leaving the node and entering the amplifier's internal stage. The currents entering the node are from the feedback network.\nThe current flowing from the output terminal through the feedback resistor $R_f$ to the inverting node is $I_f = \\frac{v_{out} - v_{-}}{R_f}$.\nThe current flowing from ground through the gain-setting resistor $R_g$ to the inverting node is $I_g = \\frac{0 - v_{-}}{R_g} = -\\frac{v_{-}}{R_g}$.\n\nAccording to KCL, the sum of currents entering the node equals the sum of currents leaving the node. Here, $i_{-}$ leaves the node.\n$$\nI_f + I_g = i_{-}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{v_{out} - v_{-}}{R_f} - \\frac{v_{-}}{R_g} = i_{-}\n$$\nSubstitute $v_{out} = Z_T i_{-}$ into this equation, which gives $i_{-} = v_{out} / Z_T$.\n$$\n\\frac{v_{out} - v_{-}}{R_f} - \\frac{v_{-}}{R_g} = \\frac{v_{out}}{Z_T}\n$$\nNow, substitute the ideal buffer condition, $v_{-} = v_{in}$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{out} - v_{in}}{R_f} - \\frac{v_{in}}{R_g} = \\frac{v_{out}}{Z_T}\n$$\nOur goal is to find the closed-loop gain $A_v = v_{out} / v_{in}$. We rearrange the equation to group terms with $v_{out}$ and $v_{in}$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{out}}{R_f} - \\frac{v_{in}}{R_f} - \\frac{v_{in}}{R_g} = \\frac{v_{out}}{Z_T}\n$$\n$$\nv_{out} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_f} - \\frac{1}{Z_T} \\right) = v_{in} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_f} + \\frac{1}{R_g} \\right)\n$$\nThe closed-loop voltage gain is therefore:\n$$\nA_v = \\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{R_f} + \\frac{1}{R_g}}{\\frac{1}{R_f} - \\frac{1}{Z_T}}\n$$\nThe problem states to assume an ideal CFA, which means the open-loop transimpedance gain $Z_T \\to \\infty$. As $Z_T \\to \\infty$, the term $1/Z_T \\to 0$.\nThe expression for the gain simplifies to:\n$$\nA_v = \\frac{\\frac{1}{R_f} + \\frac{1}{R_g}}{\\frac{1}{R_f}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{R_f} + \\frac{1}{R_g} \\right) R_f = 1 + \\frac{R_f}{R_g}\n$$\nThis is the standard formula for the closed-loop gain of an ideal non-inverting CFA.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $R_f = 3.30 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega = 3300 \\, \\Omega$ and $R_g = 270 \\, \\Omega$.\n$$\nA_v = 1 + \\frac{3300 \\, \\Omega}{270 \\, \\Omega}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{3300}{270} = \\frac{330}{27} = \\frac{110}{9} \\approx 12.222...\n$$\nNow, add 1 to this value:\n$$\nA_v = 1 + 12.222... = 13.222...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures are 1, 3, and 2.
