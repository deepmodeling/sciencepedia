In this specific design, an input voltage, $V_{in}$, is fed into an inverting integrator circuit. The output of the integrator, $V_{int}$, ramps downwards at a rate proportional to $V_{in}$. A comparator continuously monitors $V_{int}$ and triggers an output pulse when $V_{int}$ reaches a fixed negative threshold voltage, $-V_{T}$.
