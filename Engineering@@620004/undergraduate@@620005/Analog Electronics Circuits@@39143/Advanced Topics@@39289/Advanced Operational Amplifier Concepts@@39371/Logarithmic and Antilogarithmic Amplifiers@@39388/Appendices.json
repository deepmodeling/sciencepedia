With an ideal BJT model, $I_{C}=I_{S}\\exp(-V_{out}/V_{T})$ cannot be zero for any finite $V_{out}$, so the loop cannot balance; the op-amp will saturate. $V_{out}$ will not be linearly related to $V_{in}$ (which is disconnected). Not consistent.\n\nB. Q1 base-emitter short: This forces $V_{out}=0$ (emitter shorted to the grounded base). The op-amp output is clamped to ground; the inverting node is no longer controlled by feedback from $V_{out}$. $V_{out}$ is approximately zero, not a linear function of $V_{in}$. Not consistent.\n\nC. Q1 collector-emitter short: This creates a direct short from the op-amp output to the inverting node, replacing the nonlinear BJT feedback with an ohmic (approximately zero-resistance) feedback element. The circuit degenerates into a linear inverting configuration with feedback impedance approximately a short. In the ideal limit $R_{f}\\to 0$, $V_{out}\\to 0$; with any finite series resistance in the fault path, the transfer becomes $V_{out}=-\\frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}}V_{in}$, i.e., a linear inverting relationship. Crucially, the nonlinearity is eliminated and the behavior becomes linear, matching the observation qualitatively.\n\nD. Base open (floating): The feedback path becomes two series junctions (emitter-base and base-collector). When both are forward biased, the feedback current retains an exponential dependence on the sum of junction voltages, still yielding logarithmic behavior (with a different scale factor). This does not produce a linear $V_{out}$ vs. $V_{in}$. Not consistent.\n\nE. Collector-base short: With the base tied to ground by design, this shorts the inverting node to ground, removing feedback from $V_{out}$. Both op-amp inputs are at ground, so the ideal op-amp output is $V_{out}=0$, independent of $V_{in}$. Not consistent.\n\nAmong the options, only a collector-emitter short in Q1 directly converts the nonlinear feedback into an effectively linear (resistive) feedback path, producing an inverting linear relationship between $V_{out}$ and $V_{in}$.
