Thus, the maximum required rate of change for an undistorted sinusoidal signal of peak amplitude $V_p$ and frequency $f$ is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{dv_o}{dt} \\right)_{\\text{max}} = \\omega V_p = 2\\pi f V_p $$\n\nThe slew rate (SR) of the op-amp is the absolute maximum rate of change it can produce at its output. To avoid slew-induced distortion, the required rate of change for the signal must not exceed the op-amp's slew rate. The limiting condition, which defines the boundary of undistorted operation, occurs when these two values are equal.\n\nThe FPBW, denoted as $f_{FPBW}$, is the maximum frequency at which the op-amp can deliver its maximum rated peak output voltage, $V_{omax}$, without this distortion. We find this frequency by setting the maximum required rate of change (with $V_p = V_{omax}$ and $f = f_{FPBW}$) equal to the slew rate:\n$$ SR = 2\\pi f_{FPBW} V_{omax} $$\n\nWe can now solve for $f_{FPBW}$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$ f_{FPBW} = \\frac{SR}{2\\pi V_{omax}} $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nSlew Rate, $SR = 15 \\text{ V}/\\mu\\text{s}$\nMaximum rated peak output voltage, $V_{omax} = 13 \\text{ V}$\n\nBefore substituting the values, we must ensure all units are consistent.
