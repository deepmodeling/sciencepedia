The parallel arrangement of these two copper traces, separated by a dielectric medium, forms an unwanted parasitic capacitor.

Fast-switching digital logic generates noisy currents that must return to their source, and if these return paths are shared with sensitive analog circuitry, noise injection is inevitable. This practice [@problem_id:1326478] moves from the component level to the system level, exploring the crucial concept of partitioning a PCB and implementing a \"star ground\" connection. Mastering this technique is essential for ensuring the integrity of analog signals and the accuracy of components like Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs).", "problem": "A systems engineer is designing a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for a simple data acquisition system. The board contains three main components:\n1.  An analog temperature sensor which outputs a voltage proportional to the ambient temperature.\n2.  An Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which converts the sensor's analog voltage into a digital value.\n3.  A microcontroller which processes the digital data from the ADC.\n\nTo minimize noise and ensure measurement accuracy, the layout engineer has partitioned the PCB into two distinct areas: an analog section and a digital section. The analog sensor is placed entirely within the analog section, which has its own analog ground plane (AGND). The microcontroller is placed entirely within the digital section, which has its own digital ground plane (DGND). The ADC is a mixed-signal component and is placed directly on the partition line separating the two sections.\n\nFor the system to function correctly, the AGND and DGND planes must be connected to establish a common reference potential.

Use a wide copper trace to connect the AGND and DGND planes at the location of the analog temperature sensor.", "solution": "We model the analog and digital ground planes as finite-impedance return paths with frequency-dependent impedances $Z_{A}(\\omega)$ and $Z_{D}(\\omega)$, respectively. A mixed-signal component (the ADC) straddles the split and has analog and digital ground pins that must both be referenced to a common potential to avoid error. Let the single intended connection between AGND and DGND be at a point $P$ with impedance $Z_{P}(\\omega)$. The digital return currents associated with the ADC interface and microcontroller are denoted $I_{d}(\\omega)$, while the sensitive analog return currents are $I_{a}(\\omega)$.\n\nA central principle is that high-frequency return currents follow the path of least impedance, which is the path of least inductance under their signal traces, and any shared impedance between noisy digital returns and sensitive analog returns creates a noise voltage $V_{\\text{error}}(\\omega)$ across that shared impedance. If a digital return $I_{d}(\\omega)$ shares ground impedance with the analog circuitry, the analog ground reference experiences\n$$\nV_{\\text{error}}(\\omega)=I_{d}(\\omega)\\,Z_{\\text{shared}}(\\omega), \\quad Z_{\\text{shared}}(\\omega)=R+ j\\omega L+\\frac{1}{j\\omega C},\n$$\nwhich corrupts measurement accuracy. Therefore, the grounding strategy should minimize $Z_{\\text{shared}}(\\omega)$ seen by analog nodes and keep digital return currents out of the analog ground plane except at a controlled single point.\n\nThe star-connection strategy at the ADC ground pins achieves this: make a single, dedicated connection between AGND and DGND only at the ADC ground pins, so the boundary between analog and digital domains is precisely at the mixed-signal component. With a single tie at $P$ located at the ADC, digital interface return currents from the microcontroller to the ADC flow to the ADC’s digital ground, then cross to analog ground only at $P$ if required internally by the ADC, and do not traverse the analog ground plane elsewhere. The induced error at the ADC ground reference is then\n$$\nV_{\\text{error}}(\\omega)=I_{d}(\\omega)\\,Z_{P}(\\omega),\n$$\nwhich is minimized by making $Z_{P}(\\omega)$ as small as practical and by avoiding any parallel connections that would create uncontrolled current loops or larger shared areas. This confines noisy currents and minimizes loop area at the analog-to-digital boundary.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\nA. Connecting AGND and DGND at the microcontroller places the tie far from the ADC boundary. Digital return currents associated with the ADC interface will see an extended path and can force current to traverse regions of the analog plane. The analog circuitry then shares a larger inductive impedance with digital return paths, increasing $V_{\\text{error}}(\\omega)=I_{d}(\\omega)\\,Z_{\\text{shared}}(\\omega)$ due to $Z_{\\text{shared}}(\\omega)\\approx j\\omega L$ growing with frequency.\n\nB. Multiple short traces distributed along the partition create multiple parallel connections, forming loops and allowing circulating currents between AGND and DGND. This destroys the single-point control, effectively merging the planes and enabling digital return currents to enter the analog region through various low-impedance paths, increasing coupling.\n\nC. Keeping AGND and DGND completely separate violates the requirement for a common reference. The ADC and microcontroller would lack a defined ground potential difference, leading to undefined logic and conversion errors. Practical mixed-signal systems require a single reference connection.\n\nD. A single, dedicated star connection at the ADC ground pins provides one controlled reference point precisely at the analog-to-digital boundary, minimizing $Z_{\\text{shared}}(\\omega)$ in the analog region and confining digital return currents.
