This first practice explores one of the most common and fundamental grounding pitfalls: common-impedance coupling. By analyzing a shared ground path in a mixed-signal system, you will see how return currents from a high-power digital section can corrupt the ground reference of a sensitive analog section, even when they are supposedly connected to the same \"ground\" [@problem_id:1308541]. This exercise uses basic principles like Ohm's Law to reveal why a \"daisy-chain\" grounding scheme can be a significant source of noise.", "problem": "A mixed-signal integrated circuit contains two main functional blocks on the same silicon die: a sensitive Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and a high-power Digital Signal Processor (DSP). To save space, a cost-effective but non-ideal grounding scheme is used. A single \"true ground\" point, considered to be at an ideal 0 V potential, is connected to the ADC's ground terminal, $G_1$, via a conducting trace with resistance $R_{g1}$. The grounding path is then extended from $G_1$ to the DSP's ground terminal, $G_2$, via a second conducting trace with resistance $R_{g2}$. This forms a \"daisy-chain\" ground connection.\n\nDuring operation, the ADC draws a small, constant return current of $I_1$. The DSP, executing a high-speed algorithm, draws a large, time-varying return current modeled as $I_2(t) = I_{2,peak} \\sin(\\omega t)$. Both currents flow towards the true ground point through this shared path. The current from the DSP, being much larger and time-varying, can corrupt the ground reference of the sensitive ADC.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- ADC return current, $I_1 = 10.0$ mA\n- Peak DSP return current, $I_{2,peak} = 500$ mA\n- Resistance of the first ground trace segment, $R_{g1} = 5.00$ m$\\Omega$\n- Resistance of the second ground trace segment, $R_{g2} = 15.0$ m$\\Omega$\n\nCalculate the peak amplitude of the AC noise voltage observed at the ADC's ground reference point, $G_1$, relative to the true ground.
