[@problem_id:1308695]", "problem": "An engineer is designing a mixed-signal Integrated Circuit (IC) on a common p-type silicon substrate. The IC contains two main functional blocks: a high-speed digital processing core and a highly sensitive analog Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), which includes a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO). The digital core is known to be a significant source of substrate noise due to the rapid switching of its transistors, which injects minority carriers (electrons) into the p-type substrate. To ensure the performance of the PLL is not degraded by this noise, several specific layout structures are implemented. The key structures are described below:\n\n*   **Structure 1:** A continuous, closed-loop of heavily doped n-type (n+) diffusion encircling the entire area occupied by the VCO. This entire loop is electrically connected via contacts to the main positive power supply rail, VDD.\n*   **Structure 2:** A very wide trace on the topmost metal layer, designed to carry the main current from the IC's power pad to the digital processing core.\n*   **Structure 3:** A large, solid plane on the lowest metal layer, located directly beneath the digital processing core and connected to the ground (GND) supply rail.\n*   **Structure 4:** A series of isolated p-type diffusion regions placed near the edge of the die, each connected to a separate bonding pad for process characterization testing.\n\nBased on the principles of analog circuit layout for noise immunity, identify which of these structures serves as a guard ring and its primary function in this context.\n\nA.

To prevent these carriers from reaching sensitive analog blocks, a common technique is to surround the analog block with a guard ring designed to collect and remove the carriers.\n\n2) A guard ring is a continuous loop of diffusion or well tied to a stable supply that forms a barrier and sink for substrate currents. For a p-type substrate, an n-type guard tied to a higher potential efficiently collects electrons because the n+/p junction is reverse-biased, creating an electric field in the depletion region that sweeps minority carriers (electrons) into the n-type region.\n\n3) Apply junction-bias reasoning. For an n+/p junction with p-region at substrate potential $V_{\\text{sub}}$ (typically ground) and n+ region tied to $V_{\\text{DD}}$, the junction bias is\n$$\nV_{n} - V_{p} = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{sub}} > 0,\n$$\nwhich is reverse bias for a p-n diode. Under reverse bias, the depletion region widens and the electric field collects electrons from the substrate into the n+ region, removing them from the substrate path toward the VCO. Thus, a continuous n+ diffusion ring tied to $V_{\\text{DD}}$ functions as an electron collector and barrier.\n\n4) Map the structures to these principles:\n- Structure 1: A continuous n+ diffusion loop tied to $V_{\\text{DD}}$ around the VCO. This is the canonical n-type guard ring in a p-type substrate; it primarily acts to collect stray electrons and prevent them from reaching the VCO.\n- Structure 2: A wide top-metal power trace reduces IR drop; it is not a guard ring.\n- Structure 3: A ground plane under the digital core provides a low-impedance return path and reduces ground bounce and electromagnetic coupling; it is a shield/return, not a guard ring around the analog block.\n- Structure 4: Isolated p-type diffusions to pads are process-monitor/test structures, not a guard ring.\n\n5) Therefore, the structure that serves as a guard ring and its primary function in this context is Structure 1, acting as a collector for stray electrons traversing the substrate, preventing them from reaching the VCO.\n\nHence, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1308695"}, {"introduction": "The abstract concept of \"substrate noise\" becomes a concrete design challenge when it affects the performance of individual transistors.

A noisy voltage signal from a digital block, represented as a source $V_{noise}(s)$ in the Laplace domain, is injected into the substrate. The conductive path through the silicon substrate from the point of noise injection to the location of a sensitive analog circuit is modeled as a single resistor with resistance $R_{sub}$.
