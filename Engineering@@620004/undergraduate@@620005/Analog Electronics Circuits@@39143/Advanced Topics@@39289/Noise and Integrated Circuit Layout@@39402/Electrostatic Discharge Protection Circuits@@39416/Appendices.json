The second diode, $D_{down}$, has its cathode connected to the internal node and its anode to the ground rail (0 V).\n\nConsider a scenario where a positive ESD event occurs at the external I/O pad. This event can be modeled as a voltage source with a peak voltage of $V_{ESD}$ being applied to the pad. For this analysis, we assume the ESD pulse is sufficiently long that a DC analysis at the peak voltage is valid. The power supply $V_{DD}$ is assumed to be ideal, meaning it can sink the resulting ESD current without its voltage level changing.
