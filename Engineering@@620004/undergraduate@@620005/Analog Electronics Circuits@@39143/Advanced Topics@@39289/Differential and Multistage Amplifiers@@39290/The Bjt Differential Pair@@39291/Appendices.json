The circuit is a symmetric BJT differential pair with both bases grounded.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the current distribution.**\nThe differential pair is perfectly symmetric because the transistors ($Q_1$ and $Q_2$) are matched, the collector resistors are identical ($R_{C1} = R_{C2} = R_C$), and the base voltages are identical ($V_{B1} = V_{B2} = 0 \\text{ V}$). Due to this symmetry, the tail current $I_{EE}$ from the constant current source must split equally between the two transistors.\n\nThe emitter current of each transistor, $I_{E1}$ and $I_{E2}$, will therefore be half of the total tail current:\n$$I_{E1} = I_{E2} = \\frac{I_{EE}}{2}$$\n\n**Step 2: Relate collector current to emitter current.**\nFor a BJT, the emitter current is the sum of the collector current ($I_C$) and the base current ($I_B$): $I_E = I_C + I_B$. The collector and base currents are related by the current gain $\\beta$, where $I_C = \\beta I_B$.\nThe problem states that $\\beta$ is very large. In the limit of infinite $\\beta$, the base current $I_B = I_C / \\beta$ approaches zero. Therefore, we can make the standard and highly accurate approximation that the collector current is equal to the emitter current:\n$$I_{C1} \\approx I_{E1}$$\nCombining this with the result from Step 1, we get:\n$$I_{C1} = \\frac{I_{EE}}{2}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the collector current $I_{C1}$.**\nSubstitute the given numerical value for the tail current, $I_{EE} = 1.5 \\text{ mA}$:\n$$I_{C1} = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ mA}}{2} = 0.75 \\text{ mA}$$\nIn SI units, this is $I_{C1} = 0.75 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ A}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the collector voltage $V_{C1}$.**\nThe collector of transistor $Q_1$ is connected to the power supply $V_{CC}$ through the collector resistor $R_C$. The voltage at the collector, $V_{C1}$, can be determined by starting at the $V_{CC}$ supply and subtracting the voltage drop across the resistor $R_C$. This is an application of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.\nThe voltage drop across $R_C$ is given by Ohm's Law: $V_{R_C} = I_{C1} R_C$.\nTherefore, the collector voltage is:\n$$V_{C1} = V_{CC} - I_{C1} R_C$$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute numerical values and compute the final answer.**\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation for $V_{C1}$:\n$V_{CC} = 15 \\text{ V}$\n$I_{C1} = 0.75 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ A}$\n$R_C = 8.2 \\text{ k}\\Omega = 8.2 \\times 10^3 \\Omega$\n\n$$V_{C1} = 15 \\text{ V} - (0.75 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ A}) \\times (8.2 \\times 10^3 \\Omega)$$\n$$V_{C1} = 15 \\text{ V} - (0.75 \\times 8.2) \\text{ V}$$\n$$V_{C1} = 15 \\text{ V} - 6.15 \\text{ V}$$\n$$V_{C1} = 8.85 \\text{ V}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
