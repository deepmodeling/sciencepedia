For a rational $H(z)$, the Region of Convergence (ROC) is an annulus in the $z$-plane bounded by pole magnitudes and cannot include any pole.\n\nStandard properties for rational LTI systems:\n- If $h[n]$ is right-sided (causal), then the ROC is of the form $|z|>r_{\\max}$, where $r_{\\max}$ is the magnitude of the outermost pole.\n- If $h[n]$ is left-sided (anti-causal), then the ROC is of the form $|z|<r_{\\min}$, where $r_{\\min}$ is the magnitude of the innermost pole.\n- If $h[n]$ is two-sided (non-causal), then the ROC is a ring between poles: $r_{\\min}<|z|<r_{\\max}$.\n- BIBO stability holds if and only if the impulse response is absolutely summable, which for rational systems is equivalent to the ROC including the unit circle $|z|=1$.\n\nWith poles at magnitudes $0.8$ and $1.2$, the only possible ROCs are:\n1) $|z|>1.2$ (right-sided/causal).

This matches option C. All other options either assert stability with an ROC that excludes the unit circle or claim the system cannot be stable because of a pole outside the unit circle, which is incorrect for non-causal two-sided realizations as long as the unit circle lies in the ROC and no pole lies on it.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1754186"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational rules, we now move from analysis to synthesis. If stability is a design requirement, it dictates which Region of Convergence (ROC) must be chosen for a given set of poles. This practice [@problem_id:1754167] asks you to work backward from a given transfer function, first deducing the only ROC that ensures stability, and then determining the unique impulse response associated with it. This process is crucial in designing filters that meet specific performance criteria without becoming unstable.", "problem": "A discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system, used in a specialized signal filtering application, is characterized by its rational z-transform, which defines the system's transfer function $H(z)$.

The boundaries of the ROC are determined by the poles of the system. For a system with two real-valued poles at $0.5$ and $3$, there are three possible ROCs:\n1. $|z|  3$: The ROC is outside the outermost pole. This corresponds to a causal, unstable system because the ROC does not include the unit circle.\n2. $|z|  0.5$: The ROC is inside the innermost pole. This corresponds to an anti-causal, unstable system because the ROC does not include the unit circle.\n3. $0.5  |z|  3$: The ROC is an annular region between the two poles.

The ROC for the entire system, $0.5  |z|  3$, satisfies $|z|0.5$. An ROC of the form $|z||a|$ corresponds to a right-sided (causal) sequence.
