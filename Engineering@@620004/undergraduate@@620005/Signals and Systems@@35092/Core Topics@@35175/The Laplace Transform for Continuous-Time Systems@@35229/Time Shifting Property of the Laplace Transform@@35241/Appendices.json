The displacement is the integral of the velocity function $v(t)$ over this interval:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\int_{0}^{2T} v(t) dt $$\nTo perform this integration, we must first find the time-domain velocity signal $v(t)$ by taking the inverse Laplace transform of the given expression for $V(s)$.\n\nThe given Laplace transform is:\n$$ V(s) = \\frac{A}{s^2} - \\frac{A e^{-Ts}}{s^2} $$\nBy the linearity of the inverse Laplace transform, we can find the inverse transform of each term separately:\n$$ v(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{V(s)\\} = A \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s^2}\\right\\} - A \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{e^{-Ts}}{s^2}\\right\\} $$\nFirst, let's consider the term $\\frac{1}{s^2}$.
