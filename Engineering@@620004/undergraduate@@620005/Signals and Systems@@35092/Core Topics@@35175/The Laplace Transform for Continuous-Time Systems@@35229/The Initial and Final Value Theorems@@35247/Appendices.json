The theorem states that if a signal $x(t)$ is causal and its final value $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t)$ exists and is finite, then this value can be computed from its Laplace transform $X(s)$ as:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sX(s) $$\nA sufficient condition for the final value to exist is that all poles of the function $sX(s)$ must lie in the strict left-half of the complex s-plane. This is equivalent to stating that all poles of $X(s)$ must lie in the left-half plane, with the exception of at most a single simple pole at the origin, $s=0$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that this condition is met for the given Laplace transform $X(s)$. The expression for $X(s)$ is:\n$$ X(s) = \\frac{2(s+5)}{s(s^2 + 5s + 6)} $$\nThe poles of $X(s)$ are the roots of the denominator polynomial, $D(s) = s(s^2 + 5s + 6)$.\nSetting the denominator to zero, we get:\n$$ s(s^2 + 5s + 6) = 0 $$\nOne pole is immediately identified as $s_1 = 0$.\nTo find the other poles, we solve the quadratic equation $s^2 + 5s + 6 = 0$. We can factor this quadratic as:\n$$ (s+2)(s+3) = 0 $$\nThis gives two additional poles: $s_2 = -2$ and $s_3 = -3$.\n\nThe poles of $X(s)$ are located at $s=0$, $s=-2$, and $s=-3$. We have a single, simple pole at the origin ($s=0$), and the other two poles ($-2$ and $-3$) have strictly negative real parts, meaning they are in the left-half of the s-plane.
