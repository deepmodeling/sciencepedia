Described by a system function $H(z)$ that has at least one pole located at $z = 2$.\n\nA senior engineer reviews the design and states that it is impossible for any LTI system to simultaneously satisfy these three properties. Which of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental reason for this contradiction, based on the properties of the Z-transform and its Region of Convergence (ROC)?\n\nA. A system with a pole at $z=2$ cannot be causal, because all poles of a causal system must be located inside the unit circle, i.e., $|z|<1$.\n\nB. A system with a pole at $z=2$ cannot be stable, because for any stable system, the ROC must be the entire z-plane, which is not possible if there are poles.\n\nC. Causality for an LTI system with a pole at $z=2$ requires the ROC to be the region $|z|>R_{max}$ where $R_{max} \\ge 2$. Stability requires the ROC to include the unit circle, $|z|=1$. These two conditions for the ROC are incompatible.\n\nD. For the system to be stable, the unit circle must not contain any poles. The pole at $z=2$ is not on the unit circle, so there is no contradiction and the engineer's claim is valid.\n\nE. All poles of a stable and causal LTI system must be strictly inside the unit circle. Since the pole at $z=2$ is outside, the system cannot be both stable and causal.", "solution": "Let the LTI system have impulse response $h[n]$ and system function $H(z)=\\mathcal{Z}\\{h[n]\\}$ with a pole at $z=2$. By the definition of the $z$-transform, $H(z)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}h[n]z^{-n}$, and its region of convergence (ROC) is the set of $z$ for which this sum converges. Fundamental ROC properties for rational $H(z)$ imply that poles lie on the boundary of the ROC.\n\nCausality requires that $h[n]=0$ for $n<0$. For a right-sided $h[n]$, the ROC is the exterior of the outermost pole, i.e., if the pole radii are $\\{r_{k}\\}$ then the ROC is $|z|>R_{\\max}$ where $R_{\\max}=\\max_{k}r_{k}$.

Therefore an LTI system that is both causal and stable cannot have a pole at $z=2$. This is precisely the reasoning stated in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because causality does not require poles to lie inside the unit circle; it only fixes the ROC to be exterior to the outermost pole. Option B is incorrect because stability does not require the ROC to be the entire $z$-plane; it requires inclusion of the unit circle. Option D ignores the ROC constraint for causality.
