Since the ROC is a right half-plane, $h(t)$ is right-sided, hence the system is causal.\n\nStability criterion: An LTI system is BIBO stable if and only if $h(t)$ is absolutely integrable. For rational $H(s)$, this is equivalent to the ROC including the imaginary axis $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}=0$. Since $0 > -2$, the imaginary axis lies within the ROC $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > -2$, so the system is stable.\n\nTherefore, from the given ROC alone, we can definitively conclude that the system is both stable and causal.

For a right-sided sequence, the Region of Convergence (ROC) of the $Z$-transform is the exterior of the outermost pole and includes infinity.

Under the causal ROC $|z|>2$, the unit circle is not included, so the system is not BIBO stable. Equivalently, for a causal rational system, BIBO stability requires all poles to be inside the unit circle; here, there is a pole at $z=-2$ with $|-2|=2>1$, so the system is unstable.
