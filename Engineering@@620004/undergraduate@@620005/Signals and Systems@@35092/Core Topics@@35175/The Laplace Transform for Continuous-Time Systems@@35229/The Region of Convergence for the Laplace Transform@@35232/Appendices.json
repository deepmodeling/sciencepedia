The set of values of $s$ for which this integral converges is the Region of Convergence (ROC). The ROC is intrinsically linked to the time-domain characteristics of the signal $x(t)$.\n\nThe given Laplace transform is $X(s) = \\frac{1}{s(s+1)}$. To determine the inverse transform $x(t)$, we first perform a partial fraction expansion of $X(s)$.\nLet $X(s) = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+1}$.\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are the residues at the respective poles.\nThe pole at $s=0$ gives the residue $A$:\n$$A = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s X(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{s+1} = \\frac{1}{0+1} = 1$$\nThe pole at $s=-1$ gives the residue $B$:\n$$B = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1) X(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1$$\nThus, the partial fraction expansion is:\n$$X(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+1}$$\nThe function $X(s)$ has two terms, one corresponding to a pole at $s=0$ and the other to a pole at $s=-1$.
