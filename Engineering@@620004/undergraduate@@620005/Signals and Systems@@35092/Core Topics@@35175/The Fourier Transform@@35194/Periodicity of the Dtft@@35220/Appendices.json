The most fundamental of these is periodicity.\n\nLet's examine the periodicity of $X(e^{j\\omega})$. We replace $\\omega$ with $\\omega + 2\\pi k$ for any integer $k$:\n$$X(e^{j(\\omega + 2\\pi k)}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] e^{-j(\\omega + 2\\pi k) n}$$\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can separate the terms:\n$$X(e^{j(\\omega + 2\\pi k)}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] e^{-j\\omega n} e^{-j2\\pi k n}$$\nAccording to Euler's formula, $e^{-j2\\pi k n} = \\cos(2\\pi k n) - j\\sin(2\\pi k n)$.

Therefore, the function $1 + \\omega^2$ is not periodic with period $2\\pi$ and cannot be a valid DTFT. This corresponds to option B.\n\nNow, let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. While it is true that the DTFT of an absolutely summable signal ($\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x[n]| < \\infty$) is bounded, boundedness is not the *most fundamental* reason. Periodicity is a direct consequence of the DTFT definition itself, regardless of convergence conditions. The lack of periodicity is a more foundational flaw than the lack of boundedness.\n\nC. This statement claims the function lacks conjugate symmetry. For a real-valued signal $x[n]$, its DTFT must satisfy $X(e^{j\\omega}) = X^*(e^{-j\\omega})$, where $*$ denotes the complex conjugate. Let's test the proposed function $X_p(e^{j\\omega}) = 1 + \\omega^2$:\nThe left side is $X_p(e^{j\\omega}) = 1+\\omega^2$.\nThe right side is $X_p^*(e^{-j\\omega})$. First, let's find $X_p(e^{-j\\omega}) = 1 + (-\\omega)^2 = 1 + \\omega^2$. Since this is a purely real function, its complex conjugate is itself: $X_p^*(e^{-j\\omega}) = 1 + \\omega^2$.\nSince $1 + \\omega^2 = 1 + \\omega^2$, the function *does* satisfy the conjugate symmetry property for a real signal. Therefore, this option provides a factually incorrect criticism.\n\nD. This statement is false. The DTFT is a continuous function of $\\omega$ over the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. Only signals $x[n]$ with a finite number of non-zero samples have a DTFT that is a finite sum of complex exponentials (a trigonometric polynomial). Many common signals, like $x[n]=a^n u[n]$ (for $|a|<1$), have DTFTs that are not finite sums, e.g., $X(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{1}{1-ae^{-j\\omega}}$.\n\nE. This statement is false. The value of the DTFT at $\\omega=0$ is given by $X(e^{j0}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] e^{0} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n]$. This is the sum of all values of the signal (the DC component), which does not have to be zero. For example, for the signal $x[n]=\\delta[n]$ (the unit impulse), $X(e^{j\\omega}) = 1$, and $X(e^{j0}) = 1$. The student's proposed function gives $X(e^{j0})=1$, which is perfectly valid in this regard.\n\nConclusion: The only accurate and fundamental reason among the choices is that the proposed function violates the DTFT's inherent periodicity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1741514"}, {"introduction": "The consequences of DTFT periodicity extend beyond the transform itself, influencing many derived properties used in system analysis.
