The solution involves two main steps: first, determining the properties of the Fourier Transform of $x(t)$, which we will denote as $X(j\\omega)$, and second, using the differentiation in frequency property to find the properties of $Y(j\\omega)$.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the properties of $X(j\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\}$. We are given that the signal $x(t)$ has two properties: it is real and it is odd.\n\n1.  **Property from $x(t)$ being real:** For any real-valued signal $x(t)$, its Fourier Transform $X(j\\omega)$ must exhibit conjugate symmetry. This means $X(j\\omega) = X^*(-j\\omega)$, where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. This property implies that the real part of $X(j\\omega)$ is an even function of $\\omega$, and the imaginary part of $X(j\\omega)$ is an odd function of $\\omega$.\n    $$ \\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = \\text{Re}\\{X(-j\\omega)\\} $$\n    $$ \\text{Im}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = -\\text{Im}\\{X(-j\\omega)\\} $$\n\n2.  **Property from $x(t)$ being odd:** For any odd signal $x(t) = -x(-t)$, its Fourier Transform $X(j\\omega)$ is also an odd function of $\\omega$. That is, $X(j\\omega) = -X(-j\\omega)$.\n\nNow, we combine these two properties for $X(j\\omega)$.\nWe can write $X(j\\omega)$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts: $X(j\\omega) = \\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} + j \\cdot \\text{Im}\\{X(j\\omega)\\}$.\nFrom the odd property, we have:\n$$ \\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} + j \\cdot \\text{Im}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = -X(-j\\omega) = -(\\text{Re}\\{X(-j\\omega)\\} + j \\cdot \\text{Im}\\{X(-j\\omega)\\}) $$\nFrom the real-signal property, we know $\\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = \\text{Re}\\{X(-j\\omega)\\}$. Substituting this into the equation above:\n$$ \\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} + j \\cdot \\text{Im}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = -\\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} - j \\cdot \\text{Im}\\{X(-j\\omega)\\} $$\nEquating the real parts on both sides gives:\n$$ \\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = -\\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} $$\nThis equation holds only if $\\text{Re}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = 0$. This means that $X(j\\omega)$ is purely imaginary.\nLet's verify the imaginary parts. Equating them gives $\\text{Im}\\{X(j\\omega)\\} = -\\text{Im}\\{X(-j\\omega)\\}$, which is the known property for a real signal and is consistent.\nSo, if $x(t)$ is real and odd, its Fourier Transform $X(j\\omega)$ is purely imaginary and odd. We can write $X(j\\omega) = j B(\\omega)$, where $B(\\omega)$ is a real and odd function of $\\omega$.\n\nNext, we determine the properties of $Y(j\\omega)$. The signal is $y(t) = t \\cdot x(t)$. We use the differentiation in frequency property of the Fourier Transform, which states:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{t \\cdot x(t)\\} = j \\frac{d}{d\\omega} X(j\\omega) $$\nTherefore, $Y(j\\omega) = j \\frac{d}{d\\omega} X(j\\omega)$.\n\nNow we can substitute the form of $X(j\\omega)$ we derived:\n$$ Y(j\\omega) = j \\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\left( j B(\\omega) \\right) = j^2 \\frac{d B(\\omega)}{d\\omega} = - \\frac{d B(\\omega)}{d\\omega} $$\nWe need to determine the properties of $Y(j\\omega)$ from this expression.\n\n1.  **Real vs. Imaginary property:** We established that $B(\\omega)$ is a real function of $\\omega$. The derivative of a real function with respect to a real variable is also a real function. Therefore, $\\frac{d B(\\omega)}{d\\omega}$ is a real function. This means $Y(j\\omega) = - \\frac{d B(\\omega)}{d\\omega}$ is also a **purely real** function. This eliminates options C, D, and E.\n\n2.  **Even vs. Odd property:** We established that $B(\\omega)$ is an odd function, meaning $B(-\\omega) = -B(\\omega)$. Let's consider the symmetry of its derivative, $G(\\omega) = \\frac{d B(\\omega)}{d\\omega}$. We check the value of $G(\\omega)$ at $-\\omega$:\n$$ G(-\\omega) = \\left. \\frac{d B(u)}{du} \\right|_{u=-\\omega} $$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{d\\omega} B(-\\omega) = B'(-\\omega) \\cdot (-1)$, where $B'$ is the derivative.\nAlso, by differentiating the identity $B(-\\omega) = -B(\\omega)$ with respect to $\\omega$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\omega} B(-\\omega) = \\frac{d}{d\\omega} (-B(\\omega)) $$\n$$ B'(-\\omega) \\cdot (-1) = -B'(\\omega) $$\n$$ B'(-\\omega) = B'(\\omega) $$\nThis shows that the derivative of an odd function is an even function. So, $\\frac{d B(\\omega)}{d\\omega}$ is an even function.\nSince $Y(j\\omega)$ is a constant multiple ($ -1 $) of $\\frac{d B(\\omega)}{d\\omega}$, $Y(j\\omega)$ is also an **even** function.\n\nCombining both results, $Y(j\\omega)$ is a **real and even** function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1713565"}]}
