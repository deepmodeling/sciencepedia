The overall signal representing the system's state is given by $x(t) = C e^{-at}u(t)$. In this model, $t$ represents time, while $C$ and $a$ are positive real constants related to the initial amplitude and decay rate, respectively. The function $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, defined as $u(t) = 1$ for $t \\ge 0$ and $u(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$.\n\nIn signal analysis, it is often useful to decompose a signal into its even and odd components. The even component, denoted $x_e(t)$, and the odd component, $x_o(t)$, are defined such that $x(t) = x_e(t) + x_o(t)$, where $x_e(t)$ must satisfy the property $x_e(t) = x_e(-t)$.\n\nCalculate the total energy contained in the even component $x_e(t)$ of the signal $x(t)$. The total energy $E_g$ of any signal $g(t)$ is given by the integral $E_g = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g(t)|^2 dt$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the constants $C$ and $a$.", "solution": "The first step is to find the expression for the even part, $x_e(t)$, of the given signal $x(t)$. The even part of any signal $x(t)$ is defined as:\n$$x_e(t) = \\frac{1}{2}[x(t) + x(-t)]$$\nThe given signal is $x(t) = C e^{-at}u(t)$. To find $x_e(t)$, we first need to determine the time-reversed signal, $x(-t)$. We substitute $-t$ for $t$ in the expression for $x(t)$:\n$$x(-t) = C e^{-a(-t)}u(-t) = C e^{at}u(-t)$$\nNow, we can write the expression for the even part $x_e(t)$:\n$$x_e(t) = \\frac{1}{2} [C e^{-at}u(t) + C e^{at}u(-t)] = \\frac{C}{2} [e^{-at}u(t) + e^{at}u(-t)]$$\nThe next step is to calculate the total energy, $E_{x_e}$, of this even signal. The energy is defined by the integral:\n$$E_{x_e} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x_e(t)|^2 dt$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_e(t)$ into the integral:\n$$E_{x_e} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left| \\frac{C}{2} [e^{-at}u(t) + e^{at}u(-t)] \\right|^2 dt$$\nSince $C$, $a$, and $t$ are real, we can simplify the expression inside the integral:\n$$E_{x_e} = \\frac{C^2}{4} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [e^{-at}u(t) + e^{at}u(-t)]^2 dt$$\nWe expand the squared term in the integrand:\n$$[e^{-at}u(t) + e^{at}u(-t)]^2 = (e^{-at}u(t))^2 + 2(e^{-at}u(t))(e^{at}u(-t)) + (e^{at}u(-t))^2$$\n$$= e^{-2at}u^2(t) + 2e^{-at}e^{at}u(t)u(-t) + e^{2at}u^2(-t)$$\nBy definition, the Heaviside step function $u(t)$ is either 0 or 1, so $u^2(t) = u(t)$ and $u^2(-t) = u(-t)$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$= e^{-2at}u(t) + 2u(t)u(-t) + e^{2at}u(-t)$$\nThe product $u(t)u(-t)$ is non-zero only at $t=0$, where it equals 1 based on the given definition of $u(t)$. Since the integral of a function that is non-zero at only a single point is zero, the cross-term $2u(t)u(-t)$ does not contribute to the total energy. Thus, the integral becomes:\n$$E_{x_e} = \\frac{C^2}{4} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [e^{-2at}u(t) + e^{2at}u(-t)] dt$$\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\n$$E_{x_e} = \\frac{C^2}{4} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2at}u(t) dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{2at}u(-t) dt \\right]$$\nThe Heaviside functions $u(t)$ and $u(-t)$ alter the limits of integration. The term $u(t)$ is 1 for $t \\ge 0$ and 0 otherwise, so the first integral becomes:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2at}u(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-2at} dt$$\nSimilarly, $u(-t)$ is 1 for $t \\le 0$ and 0 otherwise, so the second integral becomes:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{2at}u(-t) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{2at} dt$$\nNow we evaluate these two definite integrals. Since $a>0$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-2at} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-2at}}{-2a} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{e^{-2at}}{-2a}\\right) - \\frac{e^{0}}{-2a} = 0 - \\left(\\frac{1}{-2a}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2a}$$\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{2at} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{2at}}{2a} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{0} = \\frac{e^{0}}{2a} - \\lim_{t\\to-\\infty} \\left(\\frac{e^{2at}}{2a}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2a} - 0 = \\frac{1}{2a}$$\nFinally, we substitute these results back into the expression for the energy $E_{x_e}$:\n$$E_{x_e} = \\frac{C^2}{4} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2a} \\right] = \\frac{C^2}{4} \\left( \\frac{2}{2a} \\right) = \\frac{C^2}{4a}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{C^{2}}{4a}}$$", "id": "1768238"}, {"introduction": "Building on the even-odd decomposition, we now explore how these symmetries behave within the realm of complex-valued signals.
