This means $x[n]$ is non-zero only for a finite range of integer values of $n$, and is zero everywhere else. The student computes the signal's Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), denoted as $X(e^{j\\omega})$, and claims that the magnitude spectrum $|X(e^{j\\omega})|$ has a very specific shape: it is non-zero for frequencies $\\omega$ in the range $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\omega < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, and is identically zero for all other frequencies in the fundamental period $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, i.e., $|X(e^{j\\omega})| = 0$ for $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le |\\omega| \\le \\pi$.\n\nA professor points out that, for any non-trivial finite-duration signal (i.e., a signal $x[n]$ that is not zero for all $n$), this claim is fundamentally impossible.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why the student's claim is impossible?\n\nA. The DTFT of a finite-duration signal is a polynomial in the variable $e^{-j\\omega}$. A non-zero polynomial can only have a finite number of roots, so its magnitude cannot be zero over a continuous interval of $\\omega$ unless the signal itself is identically zero.\n\nB. All magnitude spectra of real-valued, finite-duration signals must be strictly positive for all frequencies, i.e., $|X(e^{j\\omega})| > 0$ for all $\\omega$. The student's claim violates this property.\n\nC. The DTFT of any discrete-time signal must be periodic with a period of $\\pi$. The student's description implies a spectrum that is zero in parts of the $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ interval, which contradicts this periodicity.\n\nD. According to Parseval's theorem, the energy in the time domain must equal the energy in the frequency domain. A spectrum that is zero over a portion of the frequency band implies zero energy, which is only possible for the all-zero signal.\n\nE. Any finite-duration signal can be represented as a sum of a finite number of complex exponentials, which means its spectrum must consist of a finite number of impulses (delta functions), not a continuous function as described.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental reason why a non-trivial, finite-duration discrete-time signal cannot have a Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) magnitude that is zero over a continuous interval of frequencies. Let's analyze the properties of the DTFT for such a signal.\n\nThe DTFT of a signal $x[n]$ is defined as:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] e^{-j\\omega n}\n$$\nThe problem states that the signal $x[n]$ is of finite duration. This means that $x[n]$ is non-zero only for a finite range of indices, say from $n=N_1$ to $n=N_2$, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are finite integers. Therefore, the infinite summation in the DTFT definition becomes a finite sum:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=N_1}^{N_2} x[n] e^{-j\\omega n}\n$$\nThis expression is the key to understanding the error in the student's claim. Let's examine its mathematical structure. If we define a complex variable $z = e^{j\\omega}$, then we can write the DTFT as a function of $z$:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=N_1}^{N_2} x[n] (z^{-1})^n = \\sum_{n=N_1}^{N_2} x[n] z^{-n}\n$$\nThis expression is a Laurent polynomial in $z$. A Laurent polynomial is a finite sum of positive and negative powers of a variable. For any complex variable, a non-zero polynomial of finite degree can only have a finite number of roots. More generally, a function that is analytic (like a Laurent polynomial) and is known to be zero over any continuous arc or segment of its domain must be identically zero everywhere.\n\nThe student claims that $|X(e^{j\\omega})| = 0$ for all $\\omega$ in the interval $[\\pi/2, \\pi]$ (and by symmetry, $[-\\pi, -\\pi/2]$). This implies that $X(e^{j\\omega}) = 0$ for this continuous range of $\\omega$. Because the function $X(e^{j\\omega})$ is an analytic function of $\\omega$, if it is zero over a continuous interval, it must be zero for all values of $\\omega$.\n\nIf $X(e^{j\\omega}) = 0$ for all $\\omega$, it implies that all the coefficients of the polynomial, which are the signal values $x[n]$, must be zero. This can be seen from the uniqueness of the inverse DTFT:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} X(e^{j\\omega}) e^{j\\omega n} d\\omega\n$$\nIf $X(e^{j\\omega}) = 0$ for all $\\omega$, then the integral is zero, and thus $x[n] = 0$ for all $n$.\n\nThis means the only finite-duration signal that can have a spectrum that is zero over a continuous band of frequencies is the trivial signal $x[n]=0$ for all $n$. However, the student's claim is for a non-trivial signal, as evidenced by the assertion that the spectrum is non-zero on another interval, $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, such a spectrum is impossible for any non-trivial finite-duration signal.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. This option correctly states that the DTFT of a finite-duration signal is a polynomial in $e^{-j\\omega}$ and that a non-zero polynomial cannot be zero over a continuous interval. This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\nB. This is incorrect. For example, a rectangular pulse of length $N$ has a DTFT proportional to a Dirichlet kernel (or an aliased sinc function), which has zeros at specific frequencies. The magnitude is not strictly positive.\nC. This is incorrect. The DTFT is periodic with a period of $2\\pi$, not $\\pi$.\nD. This contains faulty logic. Parseval's theorem relates the total energy, which is the integral of the squared magnitude spectrum over $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. The student's claim would yield a non-zero energy since the spectrum is non-zero on $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$. The claim does not imply zero energy.\nE. This is incorrect. It confuses a signal's representation with its spectrum. The spectrum of an aperiodic finite-duration signal is a continuous function of $\\omega$, not a set of discrete impulses. A discrete spectrum of impulses corresponds to a periodic signal.\n\nThus, statement A provides the correct reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1736105"}, {"introduction": "Having established a key theoretical constraint, let's now practice the analytical skills needed to compute a spectrum from first principles.

To find the magnitude and phase, we need to determine its sign.\nThe numerator, $1-a^2$, is positive since $0 < a < 1$.\nThe denominator, $1 - 2a\\cos(\\omega) + a^2$, can be analyzed. The minimum value of $\\cos(\\omega)$ is $-1$, which gives a denominator value of $1+2a+a^2 = (1+a)^2 > 0$.
