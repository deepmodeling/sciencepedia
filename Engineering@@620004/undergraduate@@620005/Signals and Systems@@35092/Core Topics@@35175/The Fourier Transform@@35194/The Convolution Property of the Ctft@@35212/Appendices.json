A complex transfer function is typical for most systems and does not in itself determine causality. Causality is determined by the properties of its inverse Fourier transform, $h(t)$. False.\nD.

Unless the signal is identically zero for all time, this implies some form of non-analytic behavior (like a discontinuity or a jump in a derivative) at $t=0$, which prevents its Fourier transform from decaying as rapidly as a Gaussian.
