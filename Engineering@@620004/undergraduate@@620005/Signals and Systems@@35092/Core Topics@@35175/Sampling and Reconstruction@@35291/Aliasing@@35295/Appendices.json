A single, small reflective dot is painted on the edge of the disk. At time $t=0$, the dot is located at the 3 o'clock position (the rightmost point on its circular path). The disk is illuminated by a stroboscopic light, which produces instantaneous flashes at a constant frequency of $f_s = 40$ Hz. An observer, whose perception is constructed solely from the sequence of these flashes, observes the dot. Due to the stroboscopic effect, the dot will appear to be rotating at a new, constant frequency, which we define as the apparent frequency, $f_{app}$.\n\nDetermine the value of this apparent frequency, $f_{app}$.
