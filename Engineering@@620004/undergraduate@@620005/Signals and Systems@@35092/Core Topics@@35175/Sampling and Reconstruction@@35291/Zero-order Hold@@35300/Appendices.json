The output of the sampler is a sequence of discrete values, $x[k] = x(kT)$, for integer values of $k$. This sequence is then fed into a Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) device. The ZOH converts the discrete sequence back into a continuous-time signal, which we will call $y(t)$, by holding the value of each sample for one full sampling period.
