The uniqueness of an LTI system is defined by both its transfer function's algebraic expression and its Region of Convergence (ROC). The ROC is a region in the complex z-plane where the z-transform sum converges. For a rational transfer function, the ROC is bounded by circles whose radii are determined by the magnitudes of the poles. An ROC can never contain a pole.\n\nThe poles are located at radii $|p_1|$ and $|p_2|$. Since there are two distinct pole magnitudes, these two circles divide the z-plane into three distinct regions. Each of these regions corresponds to a valid ROC and thus a unique impulse response $h[n]$.\n\nLet's list and analyze the three possible ROCs:\n\n**Case 1: The ROC is the inner disk, $|z|  |p_1|$.**\nThis ROC corresponds to an impulse response $h[n]$ that is purely left-sided.\n- **Causality:** A discrete-time LTI system is causal if and only if its ROC is the exterior of a circle, including the point $z=\\infty$. Since this ROC is an interior disk ($|z|  |p_1|$), it does not satisfy the causality condition. The system is non-causal.\n- **Stability:** A discrete-time LTI system is stable if and only if its ROC includes the unit circle, $|z|=1$. We are given that $|p_1|  1$. Therefore, the unit circle is not contained within the region $|z|  |p_1|$. The system is unstable.\n\n**Case 2: The ROC is the annulus between the poles, $|p_1|  |z|  |p_2|$.**\nThis ROC corresponds to an impulse response $h[n]$ that is two-sided (non-causal), as it is right-sided with respect to the pole $p_1$ and left-sided with respect to the pole $p_2$.\n- **Causality:** The ROC is an annulus, not the exterior of a circle. Hence, the system is non-causal.\n- **Stability:** We are given the condition $0  |p_1|  1  |p_2|$. This inequality implies that the unit circle, defined by $|z|=1$, lies within this annular region. Since the ROC includes the unit circle, the corresponding system is stable.\n\n**Case 3: The ROC is the outer region, $|z|  |p_2|$.**\nThis ROC corresponds to an impulse response $h[n]$ that is purely right-sided.\n- **Causality:** The ROC is the exterior of a circle of radius $|p_2|$. The algebraic expression for $H(z)$ has a finite number of poles, so the ROC includes $z=\\infty$. This satisfies the condition for causality. The system is causal.\n- **Stability:** We are given that $|p_2|  1$. The region $|z|  |p_2|$ consists of all points with magnitude strictly greater than $|p_2|$. This region does not include the unit circle. Therefore, the corresponding system is unstable.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\nLet's summarize the properties of the three possible distinct systems:\n1.  **System 1 (ROC: $|z|  |p_1|$):** Non-causal and Unstable.\n2.  **System 2 (ROC: $|p_1|  |z|  |p_2|$):** Non-causal and Stable.\n3.  **System 3 (ROC: $|z|  |p_2|$):** Causal and Unstable.\n\nFrom this summary, we can draw the following conclusions:\n- There is exactly one possible system that is causal (System 3).\n- There is exactly one possible system that is stable (System 2).\n- The causal system (System 3) is not the same as the stable system (System 2), as they have different ROCs and different impulse responses.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n- **A. There is exactly one possible system that is causal and exactly one possible system that is stable. These two systems are not the same.** This statement perfectly matches our findings.\n- **B. There is exactly one possible system that is causal, and this same system is also the only possible stable system.** This is false. The causal system is unstable.\n- **C. There are no possible causal systems, but there is exactly one possible stable system.** This is false. There is one causal system.\n- **D. It is not possible for any system with this pole configuration to be either causal or stable.** This is false. We found one causal system and one stable system.\n- **E. There is exactly one possible stable system. This stable system could be either causal or non-causal, depending on the specific values of $p_1$ and $p_2$.** This is false. The stable system is definitively non-causal for this pole configuration.\n- **F. There are multiple possible causal systems and multiple possible stable systems.** This is false.
