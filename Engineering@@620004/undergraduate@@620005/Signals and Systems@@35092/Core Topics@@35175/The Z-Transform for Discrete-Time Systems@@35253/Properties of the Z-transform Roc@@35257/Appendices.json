By working through this conceptual challenge [@problem_id:1745585], you will discover why a signal of finite length has a uniquely structured Region of Convergence (ROC) that forbids poles in most of the z-plane.", "problem": "Two students, Alice and Bob, are studying the properties of the z-transform. Alice claims she has designed a discrete-time signal, $x[n]$, that is non-zero only for the finite interval $N_1 \\le n \\le N_2$, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are finite integers. She further claims that the z-transform of this signal, $X(z)$, has a pole at $z = 2$. Bob argues that this is impossible based on the fundamental properties of the z-transform and its Region of Convergence (ROC).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental reason why Bob's argument is valid?\n\nA. A finite-duration signal is always stable, and for a stable signal, the ROC must include the unit circle. A pole at $z=2$ would mean the ROC is $|z|>2$ or $|z|<2$, neither of which can include the entire unit circle.\n\nB. The ROC for any finite-duration signal is the entire z-plane, with the possible exceptions of $z=0$ and/or $z=\\infty$. Since poles cannot exist within the ROC, no finite, non-zero poles are possible.\n\nC. For a signal to be of finite duration, its z-transform must be a polynomial in $z$, which has no poles in the finite z-plane.\n\nD. A pole at $z=2$ implies the signal is right-sided and grows exponentially as $2^n$. Such a signal cannot be of finite duration.\n\nE. The z-transform of a causal finite-duration signal has all its poles located at $z=0$. Since Alice's signal is finite-duration, it can be made causal by a time shift, and thus cannot have a pole at $z=2$.", "solution": "By definition, the bilateral z-transform of a discrete-time sequence $x[n]$ is\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n},\n$$\nand its Region of Convergence (ROC) is the set of $z$ for which this sum converges and $X(z)$ is analytic. If $x[n]$ is finite-duration, i.e., $x[n] \\neq 0$ only for $N_{1} \\leq n \\leq N_{2}$ with finite integers $N_1$ and $N_2$, then\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=N_{1}}^{N_{2}} x[n] z^{-n},\n$$\nwhich is a finite sum. This is a finite Laurent polynomial in $z$, consisting of finitely many terms of the form $z^{-n}$. Therefore, as a function of $z$, $X(z)$ is analytic everywhere in the finite $z$-plane except possibly at $z=0$ (if there exist negative powers of $z$, i.e., if there are terms with $n>0$) and at $z=\\infty$ (if there exist positive powers of $z$, i.e., if there are terms with $n<0$). Consequently, the ROC of a nonzero finite-duration sequence is the entire $z$-plane, possibly excluding $z=0$ and/or $z=\\infty$.\n\nA pole of $X(z)$ is a point in the $z$-plane where $X(z)$ is not analytic (typically unbounded). Since the ROC is precisely the set where $X(z)$ is analytic, no poles can lie within the ROC. For a finite-duration sequence, the ROC includes every finite nonzero $z$, hence no finite, nonzero poles are possible. In particular, a pole at $z=2$ cannot occur.\n\nEvaluating the given statements:\n- Statement B exactly captures this fundamental property: the ROC for any finite-duration signal is the entire $z$-plane, with possible exceptions at $z=0$ and/or $z=\\infty$, and thus finite, nonzero poles cannot exist.\n- Statement C incorrectly asserts that the z-transform must be a polynomial in $z$; the correct characterization is a finite Laurent polynomial (polynomial in $z^{-1}$ times possibly a power of $z$), so it may have a pole at $z=0$ or at $z=\\infty$, but not at finite nonzero $z$.\n- Statement Aâ€™s ROC argument is flawed because a pole at $z=2$ with ROC $|z|<2$ would include the unit circle, so stability alone does not rule out such a pole in general; the correct exclusion arises from the finite-duration property of the sequence.\n- Statement D incorrectly ties a pole at $z=2$ to being right-sided and growing as $2^n$; the ROC determines sidedness, and a left-sided sequence could have ROC $|z|<2$.\n- Statement E, while leveraging the idea that a causal finite-duration sequence has poles only at $z=0$ and that time shift does not move finite poles, is less fundamental than the general ROC property stated in B.\n\nTherefore, the correct and most fundamental reason is given by statement B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1745585"}, {"introduction": "The Region of Convergence is far more than a mathematical formality; it is a critical determinant of a system's real-world behavior.

The zeros of the system function do not constrain the boundaries of the ROC. For the given $H(z)$, there is a single pole at $z=p_0$. A single pole partitions the z-plane into two possible regions for the ROC:\n1.  The region *inside* the circle of radius $|p_0|$, i.e., $|z| < |p_0|$. This ROC corresponds to a left-sided (anti-causal) impulse response.\n2.  The region *outside* the circle of radius $|p_0|$, i.e., $|z| > |p_0|$. This ROC corresponds to a right-sided (causal) impulse response.\n\nWe must choose the ROC that satisfies the stability condition, which means it must contain the unit circle $|z|=1$. We are given that the pole location $p_0$ satisfies $|p_0| < 1$.\n\nLet's evaluate the two possible ROCs with this information:\n- Case 1: If the ROC were $|z| < |p_0|$. Since we are given $|p_0| < 1$, this region is entirely contained within the unit circle. For any $z$ in this ROC, $|z| < |p_0| < 1$, so it is not possible for $|z|$ to be equal to 1. Thus, this ROC does not include the unit circle. A system with this ROC would be unstable.\n\n- Case 2: If the ROC is $|z| > |p_0|$. Since we are given $|p_0| < 1$, this region represents all points outside a circle whose radius is less than 1. The unit circle, defined by $|z|=1$, is entirely contained within this region. Therefore, this choice of ROC satisfies the condition for system stability.\n\nThe location of the zero, $z_0$, does not affect the determination of the ROC's boundaries. The condition $|z_0| < 1$ simply indicates that the zero is also inside the unit circle, which is allowed. The ROC is a region of the z-plane where the z-transform converges, and it cannot contain any poles. Zeros can, and often do, lie within the ROC.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only possible ROC for a stable system with a pole at $p_0$ where $|p_0| < 1$ is $|z| > |p_0|$.
