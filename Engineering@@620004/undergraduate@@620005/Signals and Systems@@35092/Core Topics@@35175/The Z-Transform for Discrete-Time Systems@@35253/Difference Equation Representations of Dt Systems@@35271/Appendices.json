We analyze the following properties.\n\nLinearity. Let $\\mathcal{T}$ denote the system mapping $x$ to $y$. A system is linear if it satisfies superposition: for any $x_1, x_2$ and scalars $a, b$,\n$\\mathcal{T}\\{ax_1+bx_2\\} = a\\mathcal{T}\\{x_1\\}+b\\mathcal{T}\\{x_2\\}.$\nConsider $x_1[n]=\\delta[n]$ and $x_2[n]=\\delta[n-1]$ with initial rest. Compute outputs:\n- For $x_1$: $y_1[0]=x_1[0]=1$, $y_1[1]=y_1[0]y_1[-1]+x_1[1]=1\\cdot 0+0=0$, $y_1[2]=y_1[1]y_1[0]+x_1[2]=0\\cdot 1+0=0$.\n- For $x_2$: $y_2[0]=x_2[0]=0$, $y_2[1]=y_2[0]y_2[-1]+x_2[1]=0\\cdot 0+1=1$, $y_2[2]=y_2[1]y_2[0]+x_2[2]=1\\cdot 0+0=0$.\nFor $x=x_1+x_2$, we get $y[0]=1$, $y[1]=1$, and\n$$y[2]=y[1]y[0]+x[2]=1\\cdot 1+0=1.$$\nBut $(y_1+y_2)[2]=0$, so $\\mathcal{T}\\{x_1+x_2\\}\\neq \\mathcal{T}\\{x_1\\}+\\mathcal{T}\\{x_2\\}$. Hence the system is not linear. Therefore A is false.\n\nTime invariance. A system is time-invariant if a shift in the input produces an equal shift in the output. Let $x_{n_0}[n]=x[n-n_0]$ for an integer $n_0$, and let $y$ be the response to $x$ and $y_{n_0}$ be the response to $x_{n_0}$. Define $z[n]=y[n-n_0]$. Using the system equation for $y$,\n$$z[n]=y[n-n_0]=y[n-1-n_0]\\,y[n-2-n_0]+x[n-n_0]=z[n-1]z[n-2]+x_{n_0}[n].$$\nAlso, for $n0$, $z[n]=y[n-n_0]=0$ because $n-n_00$ (assuming $n_0>0$) and the system is initially at rest. Thus $z$ satisfies the same difference equation and initial rest as $y_{n_0}$ with input $x_{n_0}$. By uniqueness of the solution to the recursion with given initial conditions, $z[n]=y_{n_0}[n]$ for all $n$. Therefore $\\mathcal{T}\\{x[n-n_0]\\}=y[n-n_0]$, and the system is time-invariant. Hence B is true.\n\nCausality. A system is causal if $y[n]$ depends only on $x[k]$ for $k \\le n$. Here,\n$$y[n]=y[n-1]y[n-2]+x[n],$$\nand $y[n-1]$ and $y[n-2]$ are generated recursively from inputs up to times $n-1$ and $n-2$, respectively, under the initial rest condition. Formally, if two inputs $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$ satisfy $x[k]=\\tilde{x}[k]$ for all $k \\le n$, then by induction on $n$, one shows $y[k]=\\tilde{y}[k]$ for all $k \\le n$. Thus the system is causal. Hence C is true.\n\nBIBO stability. A system is BIBO stable if for every bounded input $x$ (i.e., there exists $M  \\infty$ such that $|x[n]| \\le M$ for all $n$), the output $y$ is bounded (i.e., there exists $B  \\infty$ such that $|y[n]| \\le B$ for all $n$). Consider the bounded input $x[n]=1$ for all $n \\ge 0$ (and $x[n]=0$ for $n0$). The output satisfies\n$$y[0]=1,\\quad y[1]=1,\\quad y[n]=y[n-1]y[n-2]+1\\ \\text{for}\\ n\\ge 2.$$\nWe first show $y[n]\\ge 1$ for all $n\\ge 0$ by induction: the base cases $y[0]=1$, $y[1]=1$ hold; if $y[n-1]\\ge 1$ and $y[n-2]\\ge 1$, then $y[n]=y[n-1]y[n-2]+1\\ge 1\\cdot 1+1=2\\ge 1$. Next, for $n\\ge 3$,\n$$y[n]=y[n-1]y[n-2]+1\\ge y[n-1]\\cdot 1+1=y[n-1]+1,$$\nusing $y[n-2]\\ge 1$. Hence by induction,\n$$y[n]\\ge y[1]+\\sum_{k=2}^{n}1=1+(n-1)=n\\quad\\text{for all }n\\ge 1.$$\nTherefore $y[n]$ is unbounded as $n\\to\\infty$ although the input is bounded. The system is not BIBO stable. Thus D is false.\n\nMemorylessness. A system is memoryless if $y[n]$ depends only on $x[n]$ at the same time index. Here $y[n]$ depends on $y[n-1]$ and $y[n-2]$, which depend on past inputs. For a concrete counterexample, take $x[0]=1$, $x[1]=1$, and $x[n]=0$ for $n\\notin\\{0,1\\}$. Then\n$$y[0]=1,\\quad y[1]=1,\\quad y[2]=y[1]y[0]+x[2]=1\\cdot 1+0=1.$$\nBut $x[2]=0$, so $y[2]$ is not a function of $x[2]$ alone. Therefore the system has memory, and E is false.\n\nCombining the results: the system is time-invariant and causal, but not linear, not BIBO stable, and not memoryless.
