Thus, the poles are located at $z_1 = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $z_2 = \\frac{3}{10}$. Since the ROC is a region of convergence, it cannot contain any poles. For a rational Z-transform, the ROC is always bounded by circles in the z-plane centered at the origin with radii equal to the magnitudes of the poles. These circles, $|z| = |\\frac{4}{5}|$ and $|z| = |\\frac{3}{10}|$, partition the complex plane into three disjoint, connected regions. These regions are the only possible candidates for the ROC.\n\nTo determine the sequence type corresponding to each region, we first perform a partial fraction expansion of $X(z)$. Let us express $X(z)$ as a sum of simpler terms:\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{A}{1 - \\frac{4}{5} z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1 - \\frac{3}{10} z^{-1}}\n$$\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are found by standard algebraic manipulation.\n$$\nA = \\left. \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{5} z^{-1}\\right) X(z) \\right|_{z^{-1}=\\frac{5}{4}} = \\left. \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2} z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{3}{10} z^{-1}} \\right|_{z^{-1}=\\frac{5}{4}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)}{1 - \\frac{3}{10}\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{5}{8}}{1 - \\frac{15}{40}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{8}}{\\frac{25}{40}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{8}}{\\frac{5}{8}} = \\frac{3}{5}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\left. \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{10} z^{-1}\\right) X(z) \\right|_{z^{-1}=\\frac{10}{3}} = \\left. \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2} z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{4}{5} z^{-1}} \\right|_{z^{-1}=\\frac{10}{3}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)}{1 - \\frac{4}{5}\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{5}{3}}{1 - \\frac{8}{3}} = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{-\\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{2}{5}\n$$\nTherefore, the decomposition is:\n$$\nX(z) = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{1 - \\frac{4}{5} z^{-1}}}_{X_1(z)} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\frac{2}{5}}{1 - \\frac{3}{10} z^{-1}}}_{X_2(z)}\n$$\nThe inverse transform of each term is found by recognizing its relation to the geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k = \\frac{1}{1-r}$ for $|r|1$.\nFor a term of the form $\\frac{C}{1 - a z^{-1}}$, there are two possible inverse transforms:\n1.  If the ROC is $|z|  |a|$, then $|a z^{-1}|  1$. The series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C(a z^{-1})^n$ converges. This corresponds to the right-sided sequence $C a^n u[n]$.\n2.  If the ROC is $|z|  |a|$, then $|a^{-1} z|  1$. We rewrite the term as $\\frac{-C z a^{-1}}{1-a^{-1}z}$ and expand as $-\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C(a^{-1}z)^n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-C)a^{-n}z^n = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{-1} (-C)a^m z^{-m}$. This corresponds to the left-sided sequence $-C a^n u[-n-1]$.\n\nThe ROC for $X(z)$ must be the intersection of the ROCs for $X_1(z)$ and $X_2(z)$. We analyze the three possible connected regions:\n\nCase 1: ROC is $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$. This region satisfies both $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$ and $|z|  \\frac{3}{10}$. Both terms correspond to right-sided sequences. The total sequence $x[n] = x_1[n] + x_2[n]$ is therefore right-sided.\n\nCase 2: ROC is $|z|  \\frac{3}{10}$. This region satisfies both $|z|  \\frac{3}{10}$ and $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$. Both terms correspond to left-sided sequences. The total sequence $x[n]$ is therefore left-sided.\n\nCase 3: ROC is $\\frac{3}{10}  |z|  \\frac{4}{5}$. For this annulus, we have $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$ and $|z|  \\frac{3}{10}$. The term $X_1(z)$ corresponds to a left-sided sequence, while $X_2(z)$ corresponds to a right-sided sequence. The total sequence $x[n]$ is two-sided.\n\nNo other ROCs are possible because any valid ROC must be a connected region in the z-plane defined by the poles, and these three cases exhaust all such possibilities. An intersection of $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$ and $|z|  \\frac{3}{10}$ is an empty set and is not a valid ROC.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the problem. We are given the additional constraints that the sequence $x[n]$ is right-sided and absolutely summable.\nA right-sided sequence, as established, corresponds to an ROC that is the exterior of the outermost pole. In this case, this is $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$.\nThe condition of absolute summability, $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x[n]|  \\infty$, implies that the ROC must include the unit circle, $|z|=1$. This is because at $z=1$, the defining sum becomes $\\sum x[n]$, and for absolute convergence, the sum $\\sum |x[n] (1)^{-n}| = \\sum |x[n]|$ must be finite. More generally, absolute convergence on the unit circle implies stability.\nThe ROC $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$ includes the unit circle, since $1  \\frac{4}{5}$. The other two possible ROCs, $|z|  \\frac{3}{10}$ and $\\frac{3}{10}  |z|  \\frac{4}{5}$, do not contain the unit circle. Thus, the given constraints uniquely specify the ROC as $|z|  \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nWith this ROC, both terms in the partial fraction expansion correspond to their right-sided inverse transforms:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{1 - \\frac{4}{5} z^{-1}}\\right\\} = \\frac{3}{5} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n u[n]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\frac{2}{5}}{1 - \\frac{3}{10} z^{-1}}\\right\\} = \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)^n u[n]\n$$\nBy linearity of the Z-transform, the sequence $x[n]$ is the sum of these two components:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{3}{5} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n u[n] + \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)^n u[n]\n$$\nThis can be written in a single closed form using the unit-step function $u[n]$:\n$$\nx[n] = \\left[ \\frac{3}{5} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n + \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)^n \\right] u[n]\n$$\nThis is the required explicit form for the right-sided, absolutely summable sequence $x[n]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left[ \\frac{3}{5} \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^n + \\frac{2}{5} \\left( \\frac{3}{10} \\right)^n \\right] u[n]}\n$$", "id": "2900333"}]}
