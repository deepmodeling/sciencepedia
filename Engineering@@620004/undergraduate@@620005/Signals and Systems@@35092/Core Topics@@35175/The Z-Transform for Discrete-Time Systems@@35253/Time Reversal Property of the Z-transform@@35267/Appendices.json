Your final answer must be expressed as a polynomial in the variable $z$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the z-transform, $Y(z)$, of a sequence $y[n]$ that is a time-reversed version of another sequence $x[n]$. The z-transform of the original sequence, $X(z)$, is provided. The time-reversal operation is defined as $y[n] = x[-n]$. We can solve this problem in two ways: by direct application of the z-transform properties or by first finding the sequences and then transforming.\n\nMethod 1: Using the time-reversal property of the z-transform.\n\nThe z-transform of a sequence $g[n]$ is defined as $G(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} g[n]z^{-n}$.\nFor our problem, the z-transform of $y[n]$ is:\n$$Y(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y[n]z^{-n}$$\nWe are given that $y[n] = x[-n]$. Substituting this into the definition of $Y(z)$:\n$$Y(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[-n]z^{-n}$$\nTo relate this back to $X(z)$, we perform a change of variables in the summation. Let $m = -n$. This implies that $n = -m$. As the index $n$ sums over all integers from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$, the new index $m$ also sums over all integers from $\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, which is equivalent to summing from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.\n$$Y(z) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[m]z^{-(-m)} = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[m]z^{m}$$\nWe can express $z^m$ as $(z^{-1})^{-m}$:\n$$Y(z) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[m](z^{-1})^{-m}$$\nThis expression is precisely the definition of the z-transform of $x[m]$, with the variable $z$ replaced by $z^{-1}$. Therefore, we arrive at the time-reversal property:\n$$Y(z) = X(z^{-1})$$\nNow, we can use the given expression for $X(z)$:\n$$X(z) = 3 - 2z^{-1} + 5z^{-2} - z^{-4}$$\nTo find $Y(z) = X(z^{-1})$, we substitute $z^{-1}$ for every $z$ in the expression for $X(z)$:\n$$Y(z) = 3 - 2(z^{-1})^{-1} + 5(z^{-1})^{-2} - (z^{-1})^{-4}$$\nUsing the identity $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, we simplify the exponents:\n$$Y(z) = 3 - 2z^{(-1) \\times (-1)} + 5z^{(-2) \\times (-1)} - z^{(-4) \\times (-1)}$$\n$$Y(z) = 3 - 2z^{1} + 5z^{2} - z^{4}$$\nThis is the z-transform of $y[n]$, expressed as a polynomial in $z$.\n\nMethod 2: Finding the sequences explicitly.\n\nThe z-transform of the original causal sequence $x[n]$ is given as:\n$$X(z) = 3 - 2z^{-1} + 5z^{-2} - z^{-4}$$\nBy comparing this to the definition $X(z) = x[0]z^0 + x[1]z^{-1} + x[2]z^{-2} + \\dots$, we can identify the non-zero terms of the sequence $x[n]$:\n$x[0] = 3$\n$x[1] = -2$\n$x[2] = 5$\n$x[3] = 0$ (since the $z^{-3}$ term is missing)\n$x[4] = -1$\nAll other terms of $x[n]$ are zero.\n\nThe new sequence is $y[n] = x[-n]$. We can find its values:\n$y[0] = x[-0] = x[0] = 3$\n$y[-1] = x[-(-1)] = x[1] = -2$\n$y[-2] = x[-(-2)] = x[2] = 5$\n$y[-3] = x[-(-3)] = x[3] = 0$\n$y[-4] = x[-(-4)] = x[4] = -1$\nAll other terms of $y[n]$ are zero. The sequence $y[n]$ is anti-causal.\n\nNow, we compute the z-transform of $y[n]$ from its definition:\n$$Y(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y[n]z^{-n}$$\nWe only need to sum over the non-zero terms of $y[n]$:\n$$Y(z) = y[-4]z^{-(-4)} + y[-3]z^{-(-3)} + y[-2]z^{-(-2)} + y[-1]z^{-(-1)} + y[0]z^{-0}$$\n$$Y(z) = y[-4]z^4 + y[-3]z^3 + y[-2]z^2 + y[-1]z^1 + y[0]z^0$$\nSubstituting the values we found for $y[n]$:\n$$Y(z) = (-1)z^4 + (0)z^3 + (5)z^2 + (-2)z^1 + (3)(1)$$\n$$Y(z) = -z^4 + 5z^2 - 2z + 3$$\nRearranging the terms in ascending order of power for clarity:\n$$Y(z) = 3 - 2z + 5z^2 - z^4$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, which is a polynomial in $z$ as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3 - 2z + 5z^{2} - z^{4}}$$", "id": "1768978"}, {"introduction": "Having practiced the basic mechanics, we now explore the deeper consequences of the time-reversal property on a system's characteristics.
