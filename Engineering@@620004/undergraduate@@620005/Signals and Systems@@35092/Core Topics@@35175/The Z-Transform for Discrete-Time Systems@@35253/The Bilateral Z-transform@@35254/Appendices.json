It is a standard, well-posed problem in the analysis of linear time-invariant systems using the bilateral $z$-transform. The definitions provided for the sequences $x[n]$ and $h[n]$ are unambiguous and common in signal processing literature. The tasks are logically sequenced and mathematically sound. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be furnished.\n\nThe analysis will proceed according to the four specified steps.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of $X(z)$ and its Region of Convergence (ROC).\n\nThe bilateral $z$-transform of the sequence $x[n]$ is given by the definition:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n}\n$$\nThe sequence is given as $x[n] = 2^{n} u[n]$. The unit step sequence $u[n]$ is defined as $1$ for $n \\ge 0$ and $0$ for $n < 0$. Substituting the expression for $x[n]$ into the definition, the summation limits are adjusted to reflect the support of $u[n]$:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (2^{n}) z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (2z^{-1})^{n}\n$$\nThis is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} r^{n}$, with the common ratio $r = 2z^{-1}$. It is a fundamental result that such a series converges if and only if the magnitude of its common ratio is strictly less than $1$. Thus, the condition for convergence is:\n$$\n|2z^{-1}| < 1\n$$\nThis inequality is solved for $|z|$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{|z|} < 1 \\implies 2 < |z|\n$$\nThis defines the Region of Convergence for $X(z)$, which is the set of all complex numbers $z$ lying outside the circle of radius $2$ in the complex plane, denoted as $\\text{ROC}_X = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| > 2\\}$.\n\nFor values of $z$ within this region, the sum of the geometric series converges to $\\frac{1}{1-r}$. Therefore, the closed-form expression for $X(z)$ is:\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Derivation of $H(z)$ and its Region of Convergence (ROC).\n\nThe sequence is given as $h[n] = -2^{n} u[-n-1]$. The sequence $u[-n-1]$ is $1$ for $-n-1 \\ge 0$, which is equivalent to $n \\le -1$, and $0$ otherwise. This is a left-sided sequence. The $z$-transform $H(z)$ is:\n$$\nH(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} (-2^{n}) z^{-n} = - \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} (2z^{-1})^{n}\n$$\nTo evaluate this summation, we perform a change of index. Let $m = -n$. As $n$ ranges from $-\\infty$ to $-1$, the new index $m$ ranges from $\\infty$ to $1$.\n$$\nH(z) = - \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} (2z^{-1})^{-m} = - \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{z}{2}\\right)^{m}\n$$\nThis is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} r^m$ with the common ratio $r = \\frac{z}{2}$. This series converges if and only if $|r| < 1$. The condition for convergence is therefore:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{z}{2}\\right| < 1 \\implies |z| < 2\n$$\nThis defines the Region of Convergence for $H(z)$, which is the set of all complex numbers $z$ lying inside the circle of radius $2$, denoted as $\\text{ROC}_H = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| < 2\\}$.\n\nFor values of $z$ in this ROC, the sum of the series $\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} r^m$ is $\\frac{r}{1-r}$. Substituting $r = \\frac{z}{2}$:\n$$\nH(z) = - \\left( \\frac{\\frac{z}{2}}{1 - \\frac{z}{2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\frac{z}{2}}{\\frac{z}{2} - 1}\n$$\nTo express this in a form comparable to $X(z)$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $\\frac{z}{2}$:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{2}{z}} = \\frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}}\n$$\nIt is a critical observation that the algebraic expressions for $X(z)$ and $H(z)$ are identical. They are distinguished solely by their respective Regions of Convergence.\n\nStep 3: Intersection of ROCs and Implication for Convolution.\n\nThe region of convergence for $X(z)$ is $\\text{ROC}_X = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| > 2\\}$.\nThe region of convergence for $H(z)$ is $\\text{ROC}_H = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| < 2\\}$.\n\nThe intersection of these two sets is:\n$$\n\\text{ROC}_X \\cap \\text{ROC}_H = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| > 2 \\text{ and } |z| < 2\\}\n$$\nThere exists no complex number $z$ whose magnitude is simultaneously greater than $2$ and less than $2$. Therefore, the intersection is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nThe convolution property of the bilateral $z$-transform states that if $y[n] = x[n] * h[n]$, its transform $Y(z) = X(z)H(z)$ has a Region of Convergence $\\text{ROC}_Y$ that must contain the intersection of the individual ROCs: $\\text{ROC}_X \\cap \\text{ROC}_H \\subseteq \\text{ROC}_Y$. Since this intersection is empty, the transform of the convolution, $Y(z)$, does not converge for any value of $z$. This implies that the convolution sum $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k]h[n-k]$ does not converge to a finite value for all $n$, and the resulting sequence $y[n]$ does not have a well-defined bilateral $z$-transform.\n\nStep 4: Algebraic Product of $X(z)H(z)$.\n\nThe problem requests the purely algebraic computation of the product $X(z)H(z)$, without regard for the implications of the ROCs. Using the expressions derived in Steps 1 and 2:\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}}\n$$\nThe product is therefore:\n$$\nX(z)H(z) = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 2z^{-1})^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the required simplified closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{(1 - 2z^{-1})^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2910971"}]}
