We will analyze each configuration separately to find the respective output Z-transforms.\n\nFirst, let's analyze **Configuration A**.\nThe input to the cascade is $x[n] = \\delta[n]$. This signal first enters the LTI system $S_1$. The output of $S_1$, let's call it $v[n]$, is the convolution of the input with the impulse response $h[n]$.\n$$v[n] = x[n] * h[n] = \\delta[n] * (a^n u[n])$$\nBy the sifting property of the delta function under convolution, convoluting any signal with $\\delta[n]$ yields the signal itself.\n$$v[n] = a^n u[n]$$\nThis sequence $v[n]$ is then fed into the multiplier block $S_2$.
