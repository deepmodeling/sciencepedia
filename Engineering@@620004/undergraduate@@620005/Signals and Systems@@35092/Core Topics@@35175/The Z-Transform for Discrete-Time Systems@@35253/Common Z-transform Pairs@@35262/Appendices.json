The Region of Convergence (ROC) for $X(z)$ is the set of all complex numbers $z$ such that $|z| > |a|$.\n\nDetermine the expression for the signal $x[n]$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the inverse z-transform of $X(z) = \\frac{3z^2}{z-a}$, given that the Region of Convergence (ROC) is $|z| > |a|$. The ROC being the exterior of a circle with radius $|a|$ indicates that the sequence $x[n]$ is right-sided.\n\nFirst, we observe that $X(z)$ is an improper rational function because the degree of the numerator polynomial (2) is greater than the degree of the denominator polynomial (1). To find the inverse transform, we can first use polynomial long division to express $X(z)$ as the sum of a polynomial in $z$ and a strictly proper rational function.\n\nWe divide the numerator $3z^2$ by the denominator $z-a$:\n```\n        3z   +  3a\n      ____________\n  z-a | 3z^2 + 0\n      -(3z^2 - 3az)\n      -------------\n             3az + 0\n           -(3az - 3a^2)\n           ------------\n                  3a^2\n```\nFrom the long division, we obtain a quotient of $3z + 3a$ and a remainder of $3a^2$. We can therefore rewrite $X(z)$ as:\n$$X(z) = 3z + 3a + \\frac{3a^2}{z-a}$$\n\nNow, we can find the inverse z-transform of each term individually, using the property of linearity.\n\n1.  **Term 1: $3z$**\n    The z-transform of a shifted unit impulse $\\delta[n-n_0]$ is $z^{-n_0}$. For the term $3z = 3z^{-(-1)}$, we have $n_0 = -1$. The inverse z-transform is therefore $3\\delta[n - (-1)] = 3\\delta[n+1]$. This term corresponds to a value of $3$ at time index $n=-1$.\n\n2.  **Term 2: $3a$**\n    This term can be written as $3az^0$, which corresponds to an unshifted, scaled impulse. The inverse z-transform is $3a\\delta[n]$. This term corresponds to a value of $3a$ at time index $n=0$.\n\n3.  **Term 3: $\\frac{3a^2}{z-a}$**\n    We need to relate this to a known z-transform pair. The z-transform of the causal geometric sequence $c^n u[n]$ is $\\frac{z}{z-c}$ with ROC $|z| > |c|$. Our ROC is $|z|>|a|$, so we can use this pair with $c=a$.\n    Let's manipulate the expression to match the standard form:\n    $$\\frac{3a^2}{z-a} = 3a^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{z-a}$$\n    To introduce a $z$ in the numerator, we can multiply and divide by $z$:\n    $$\\frac{3a^2}{z-a} = 3a^2 \\cdot z^{-1} \\cdot \\frac{z}{z-a}$$\n    Let's define a sequence $y[n]$ whose z-transform is $Y(z) = \\frac{z}{z-a}$. From the standard pair, we know that $y[n] = a^n u[n]$.\n    The term we have is $3a^2 z^{-1} Y(z)$. We now apply the time-shifting property of the z-transform, which states that if $\\mathcal{Z}\\{y[n]\\} = Y(z)$, then $\\mathcal{Z}\\{y[n-n_0]\\} = z^{-n_0}Y(z)$.\n    In our case, $n_0=1$. So, the inverse z-transform of $z^{-1}Y(z)$ is $y[n-1] = a^{n-1}u[n-1]$.\n    Therefore, the inverse z-transform of $3a^2 z^{-1} \\frac{z}{z-a}$ is $3a^2 \\cdot (a^{n-1}u[n-1]) = 3a^{n+1}u[n-1]$. This sequence is non-zero for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nCombining the inverse transforms of all three terms gives the final sequence $x[n]$:\n$$x[n] = 3\\delta[n+1] + 3a\\delta[n] + 3a^{n+1}u[n-1]$$\n\nThis expression is correct, but we can write it in a more compact form. Let's analyze the value of $x[n]$ at different time instances:\n-   At $n=-1$: $x[-1] = 3\\delta[0] + 3a\\delta[-1] + 3a^{0}u[-2] = 3(1) + 0 + 0 = 3$.\n-   At $n=0$: $x[0] = 3\\delta[1] + 3a\\delta[0] + 3a^{1}u[-1] = 0 + 3a(1) + 0 = 3a$.\n-   At $n=1$: $x[1] = 3\\delta[2] + 3a\\delta[1] + 3a^{2}u[0] = 0 + 0 + 3a^2(1) = 3a^2$.\n-   For $n \\ge 1$: The impulse terms are zero, and $u[n-1]=1$. So, $x[n] = 3a^{n+1}$.\n\nWe can see that for all $n \\ge -1$, the value of the sequence is $3a^{n+1}$. For $n  -1$, the sequence is zero. This pattern can be expressed concisely using the unit step function $u[n+1]$, which is 1 for $n \\ge -1$ and 0 otherwise.\nThus, the sequence is:\n$$x[n] = 3a^{n+1} u[n+1]$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3a^{n+1}u[n+1]}\n$$", "id": "1704720"}]}
