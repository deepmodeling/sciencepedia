The relationship is governed by the first-order differential equation:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} + T(t) = T_{amb}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the positive real-valued time constant of the sensor.\n\nSuppose the sensor, initially at a stable temperature $T_i$, is instantaneously moved at time $t=0$ into a new environment held at a constant, stable temperature $T_f$. The sensor's temperature reading $T(t)$ will begin to change, eventually approaching $T_f$.\n\nThe rise time, $t_r$, is a standard performance metric defined as the time it takes for the sensor's reading to go from 10% to 90% of its total change. That is, $t_r = t_{90} - t_{10}$, where $T(t_{10}) = T_i + 0.10(T_f - T_i)$ and $T(t_{90}) = T_i + 0.90(T_f - T_i)$.\n\nFind an exact analytical expression for the rise time $t_r$ in terms of the time constant $\\tau$.", "solution": "We model the sensor as a first-order linear system:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} + T(t) = T_{amb}(t).\n$$\nFor a step change in ambient temperature at $t=0$ from $T_{amb}(t<0)=T_{i}$ to $T_{amb}(t\\ge 0)=T_{f}$, with initial condition $T(0)=T_{i}$, we solve for $t\\ge 0$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\tau \\frac{dT_{h}}{dt} + T_{h} = 0$, which integrates to $T_{h}(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$.
