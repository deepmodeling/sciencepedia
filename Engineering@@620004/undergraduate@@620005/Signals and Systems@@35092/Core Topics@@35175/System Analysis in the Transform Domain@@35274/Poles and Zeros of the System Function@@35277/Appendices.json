The analysis must proceed from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the system's output in the Laplace domain. The system is described by the transfer function $G(s) = \\dfrac{1}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}}$, where $\\omega > 0$ is a constant. The input is the unit step function, $u(t)$, which is zero for $t  0$ and unity for $t \\ge 0$. The unilateral Laplace transform of this causal input is $U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\dfrac{1}{s}$. For an LTI system, the Laplace transform of the output, $Y(s)$, is the product of the transfer function and the Laplace transform of the input.\n$$Y(s) = G(s)U(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{s(s^{2} + \\omega^{2})}$$\n\nSecond, we mechanically apply the Final Value Theorem to find the predicted steady-state value of the output $y(t)$. The theorem states that if the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$ exists, its value is given by $\\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s)$. We compute this value without yet asserting its validity.\n$$y_{ss_{predicted}} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{1}{s(s^{2} + \\omega^{2})} \\right) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}}$$\nSubstituting $s = 0$ into the expression yields:\n$$y_{ss_{predicted}} = \\frac{1}{0^{2} + \\omega^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}$$\nThus, the Final Value Theorem predicts a steady-state value of $\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}$.\n\nThird, we determine the actual time-domain output $y(t)$ by computing the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$. This will allow us to find the true behavior of $y(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$. We use partial fraction expansion for $Y(s)$.\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{Bs + C}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}}$$\nTo find the coefficient $A$, we use the residue method:\n$$A = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}$$\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator $s(s^{2} + \\omega^{2})$, we get:\n$$1 = A(s^{2} + \\omega^{2}) + (Bs + C)s = As^{2} + A\\omega^{2} + Bs^{2} + Cs$$\n$$1 = (A + B)s^{2} + Cs + A\\omega^{2}$$\nBy comparing coefficients of powers of $s$:\n- For the constant term: $A\\omega^{2} = 1$, which gives $A = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}$. This is consistent.\n- For the $s^{2}$ term: $A + B = 0$, which implies $B = -A = -\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}$.\n- For the $s$ term: $C = 0$.\nSubstituting the coefficients back into the expansion gives:\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{1/\\omega^{2}}{s} - \\frac{(1/\\omega^{2})s}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{s}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}} \\right)$$\nWe now take the inverse Laplace transform of each term. We use the standard pairs $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\} = u(t)$ and $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\frac{s}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}}\\} = \\cos(\\omega t)u(t)$. The resulting time-domain output for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$y(t) = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}(1 - \\cos(\\omega t))u(t)$$\nTo determine the true steady-state behavior, we evaluate the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}(1 - \\cos(\\omega t))$$\nThe term $\\cos(\\omega t)$ oscillates continuously between $-1$ and $1$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Consequently, $y(t)$ oscillates between $\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}(1 - 1) = 0$ and $\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}(1 - (-1)) = \\frac{2}{\\omega^{2}}$. Because the function does not approach a single, finite value, the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$ does not exist. The system output is a persistent oscillation, not a constant steady state. This contradicts the prediction from the Final Value Theorem.\n\nFourth, we provide the rigorous justification for this failure. The Final Value Theorem is applicable to the Laplace transform $Y(s)$ of a causal signal $y(t)$ if and only if all poles of the function $sY(s)$ lie in the open left-half of the complex plane (i.e., for every pole $p$, $\\text{Re}(p)  0$).\nLet us inspect the poles of $sY(s)$ for the given system.\n$$sY(s) = \\frac{1}{s^{2} + \\omega^{2}}$$\nThe poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial $s^{2} + \\omega^{2} = 0$.\n$$s^{2} = -\\omega^{2} \\implies s = \\pm j\\omega$$\nThe poles are located at $s_1 = +j\\omega$ and $s_2 = -j\\omega$. Both poles lie on the imaginary axis, where the real part is zero. These poles are not in the open left-half plane. Therefore, the necessary condition for the validity of the Final Value Theorem is violated. The presence of poles on the imaginary axis corresponds to an oscillatory mode (in this case, $\\cos(\\omega t)$) in the time-domain response, which does not decay and prevents the output from converging to a steady-state limit. This confirms from first principles why the theorem gives an incorrect prediction. The predicted value $\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}$ is merely the DC offset or center of the undamped oscillation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2880759"}]}
