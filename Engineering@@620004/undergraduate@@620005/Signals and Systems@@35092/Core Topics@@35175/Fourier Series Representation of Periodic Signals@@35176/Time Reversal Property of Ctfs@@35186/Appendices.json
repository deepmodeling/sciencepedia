The signal $x(t)$ has coefficients $a_k$. According to the time-reversal property, the signal $x(-t)$ has coefficients $a_{-k}$.\nSince we found that $x(t) = x(-t)$, their respective Fourier series coefficients must be equal.

Replacing $a_k$ with $a_{-k}$ in the second equation gives:\n$$a_{-k} = a_{-k}^*$$\nThis equation states that the coefficient $a_{-k}$ is equal to its own complex conjugate. A complex number $z$ is equal to its conjugate $z^*$ if and only if its imaginary part is zero, meaning $z$ is a real number.
