By multiplying a baseband signal with a sinusoidal carrier, we can shift its frequency content, a fundamental technique used in radio communication. This exercise [@problem_id:1736968] will guide you through calculating the specific Fourier series coefficients of the modulated signal, demonstrating how the original signal's spectrum is replicated at different frequency locations.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a frequency-division multiplexing system, a periodic baseband signal $x(t)$ with fundamental angular frequency $\\omega_0$ is modulated onto a carrier. The signal $x(t)$ is band-limited, meaning its Fourier series coefficients, denoted by $a_k$, are non-zero only for a finite range of harmonic indices. Specifically, the coefficients are defined as $a_k = (\\frac{1}{3})^{|k|}$ for all integer indices $k$ such that $|k| \\le N$, and $a_k = 0$ for all $|k| > N$. For this particular system, the signal bandwidth is limited by $N=5$.\n\nThe modulation is performed by multiplying $x(t)$ with a periodic carrier signal $p(t) = \\cos(M \\omega_0 t)$, resulting in a transmitted signal $y(t) = x(t) p(t)$. Due to a configuration error, the integer parameter for the carrier frequency was set to $M=3$.\n\nLet the Fourier series coefficients of the transmitted signal $y(t)$ be denoted by $b_k$. Calculate the value of the coefficient $b_2$. Express your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the Fourier series coefficient $b_2$ of the signal $y(t)$, which is the product of two periodic signals, $x(t)$ and $p(t)$, both having the same fundamental period $T_0 = 2\\pi/\\omega_0$. The signal $y(t)$ is given by $y(t) = x(t) p(t)$.\n\nThe multiplication property of the Continuous-Time Fourier Series (CTFS) states that if a signal $y(t)$ is the product of two periodic signals $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ with the same period, its Fourier series coefficients $b_k$ are given by the discrete-time convolution of the coefficients of $x(t)$ (let's call them $a_k$) and the coefficients of $p(t)$ (let's call them $c_k$). The convolution is expressed as:\n$$b_k = \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_l c_{k-l}$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the Fourier series coefficients $c_k$ of the carrier signal $p(t) = \\cos(M \\omega_0 t)$. We can use Euler's formula to express the cosine in terms of complex exponentials:\n$$p(t) = \\frac{e^{jM\\omega_0 t} + e^{-jM\\omega_0 t}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} e^{jM\\omega_0 t} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-j(-M)\\omega_0 t}$$\nThe synthesis equation for a Fourier series is $p(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_k e^{jk\\omega_0 t}$. By comparing the two expressions, we can identify the non-zero coefficients of $p(t)$ by inspection. They are:\n$$c_M = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$c_{-M} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAll other coefficients $c_k$ are zero for $k \\neq \\pm M$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these coefficients $c_k$ into the convolution sum for $b_k$. Since $c_{k-l}$ is non-zero only when $k-l = M$ (which implies $l=k-M$) or when $k-l = -M$ (which implies $l=k+M$), the infinite sum reduces to just two terms:\n$$b_k = a_{k-M} c_M + a_{k+M} c_{-M}$$\nSubstituting the values for $c_M$ and $c_{-M}$:\n$$b_k = a_{k-M} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + a_{k+M} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (a_{k-M} + a_{k+M})$$\n\nThe problem asks for the specific coefficient $b_2$ and provides the value $M=3$. We substitute these values into our general expression for $b_k$:\n$$b_2 = \\frac{1}{2} (a_{2-3} + a_{2+3}) = \\frac{1}{2} (a_{-1} + a_5)$$\n\nNext, we need to find the values of $a_{-1}$ and $a_5$ using the given definition for the coefficients of $x(t)$: $a_k = (\\frac{1}{3})^{|k|}$ for $|k| \\le N=5$.\n\nFor the coefficient $a_{-1}$:\nThe index is $k=-1$. We check if $|-1| \\le 5$, which is true ($1 \\le 5$). Therefore, we use the given formula:\n$$a_{-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{|-1|} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^1 = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nFor the coefficient $a_5$:\nThe index is $k=5$. We check if $|5| \\le 5$, which is true ($5 \\le 5$). Therefore, we use the given formula:\n$$a_5 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{|5|} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{243}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute these values back into the expression for $b_2$:\n$$b_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{243}\\right)$$\nTo add the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 243.\n$$b_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1 \\times 81}{3 \\times 81} + \\frac{1}{243}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{81}{243} + \\frac{1}{243}\\right)$$\n$$b_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{81+1}{243}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{82}{243}\\right)$$\n$$b_2 = \\frac{41}{243}$$\nThis fraction is in its simplest form since 41 is a prime number and 243 is $3^5$, so they share no common factors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{41}{243}}$$", "id": "1736968"}, {"introduction": "Next, we examine the effects of a non-linear operation by squaring a signal, which is equivalent to multiplying the signal by itself.
