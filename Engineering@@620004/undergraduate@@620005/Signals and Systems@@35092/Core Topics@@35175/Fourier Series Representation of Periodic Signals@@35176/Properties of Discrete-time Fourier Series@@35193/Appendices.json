The signal $x[n]$ is real-valued. For a real signal, its DTFS coefficients must exhibit conjugate symmetry: $a_k = a_{-k}^*$. Note that the indices are interpreted modulo $N$, so $a_{-k} = a_{N-k}$.\n2.  For all odd integers $k$, the coefficients $a_k$ are purely imaginary. A complex number $z$ is purely imaginary if and only if $z = -z^*$. Therefore, for all odd $k$, we have $a_k = -a_k^*$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the DTFS coefficients of the even part, $x_e[n]$.**\nThe even part of the signal is defined as $x_e[n] = \\frac{1}{2}(x[n] + x[-n])$. Let the DTFS coefficients of $x_e[n]$ be denoted by $a_{k,e}$.\nUsing the linearity and time-reversal properties of the DTFS, we can find $a_{k,e}$.\nThe DTFS of $x[n]$ is $a_k$.\nThe DTFS of $x[-n]$ is $a_{-k}$.\nTherefore, by linearity, the DTFS of $x_e[n]$ is:\n$$a_{k,e} = \\frac{1}{2}(a_k + a_{-k})$$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the expression for $a_{k,e}$ using the properties of $x[n]$.**\nSince $x[n]$ is a real signal, we know from Step 1 that $a_{-k} = a_k^*$. Substituting this into the expression for $a_{k,e}$:\n$$a_{k,e} = \\frac{1}{2}(a_k + a_k^*) = \\text{Re}\\{a_k\\}$$\nThis result shows that the DTFS coefficients of the even part of a real signal are equal to the real part of the original signal's DTFS coefficients.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the problem's specific condition to the coefficients $a_{k,e}$.**\nThe problem states that for all odd integers $k$, the coefficient $a_k$ is purely imaginary. By definition, a purely imaginary number has a real part of zero.\nSo, for all odd $k$, $\\text{Re}\\{a_k\\} = 0$.\n\nCombining this with the result from Step 3, we find that for all odd $k$:\n$$a_{k,e} = \\text{Re}\\{a_k\\} = 0$$\nThis means that the DTFS expansion of the even signal $x_e[n]$ contains no odd-indexed harmonics.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the frequency-domain property of $x_e[n]$ to a time-domain symmetry.**\nA well-known property of the DTFS is that if a signal is periodic with an even period $N$ and its DTFS coefficients are zero for all odd harmonics (i.e., $a_k=0$ for all odd $k$), then the signal must exhibit half-period symmetry. That is, $g[n] = g[n+N/2]$ for all $n$.\n\nLet's prove this property for our signal $x_e[n]$. The synthesis equation for $x_e[n]$ is:\n$$x_e[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} a_{k,e} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} kn\\right)$$\nSince $a_{k,e}=0$ for all odd $k$, the sum is only over the even values of $k$:\n$$x_e[n] = \\sum_{k \\text{ is even}} a_{k,e} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} kn\\right)$$\nNow, let's evaluate the signal at a half-period shift, $n+N/2$:\n$$x_e[n+N/2] = \\sum_{k \\text{ is even}} a_{k,e} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} k(n+N/2)\\right)$$\n$$x_e[n+N/2] = \\sum_{k \\text{ is even}} a_{k,e} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} kn\\right) \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} k \\frac{N}{2}\\right)$$\n$$x_e[n+N/2] = \\sum_{k \\text{ is even}} a_{k,e} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} kn\\right) \\exp(j \\pi k)$$\nSince the sum is only over even values of $k$, we can write $k=2m$ for some integer $m$. The term $\\exp(j \\pi k)$ becomes $\\exp(j \\pi (2m)) = \\exp(j 2\\pi m) = 1$.\nTherefore, the expression for the shifted signal becomes:\n$$x_e[n+N/2] = \\sum_{k \\text{ is even}} a_{k,e} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} kn\\right) \\cdot (1) = x_e[n]$$\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion.**\nWe have shown that $x_e[n] = x_e[n+N/2]$ for all $n$. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA. $x_e[n] = -x_e[n]$ implies $x_e[n]=0$, which is not generally true.\nB. $x_e[n] = -x_e[-n]$ implies $x_e[n]$ is an odd signal. By definition, $x_e[n]$ is an even signal ($x_e[n]=x_e[-n]$ unless it is identically zero). So this is incorrect.\nC. $x_e[n] = x_e[n + N/2]$ matches our derived property.\nD. $x_e[n] = -x_e[n + N/2]$ is half-period anti-symmetry. Our derivation showed half-period symmetry.\nE. $x_e[n] = x[-n]$ is not generally true from the definition of the even part.\n\nThus, the correct property is $x_e[n] = x_e[n + N/2]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1743724"}]}
