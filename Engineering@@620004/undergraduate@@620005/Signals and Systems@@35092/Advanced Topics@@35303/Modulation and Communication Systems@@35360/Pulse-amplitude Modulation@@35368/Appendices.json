This exercise focuses on a key characteristic of this pulse—its energy. Calculating the signal energy is not just a mathematical formality; it lays the groundwork for practical system design, as it directly relates to transmission power requirements and the system's resilience to noise [@problem_id:1745849].", "problem": "In a digital communication system designed to transmit data over a channel, a technique known as flat-top Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM) is employed. In this scheme, discrete moments in time are used to transmit information, with the information itself encoded in the amplitude of rectangular voltage pulses.\n\nLet us analyze a single, isolated pulse, $p(t)$, generated by the system's transmitter. This pulse is defined by a constant amplitude of $A$ volts over a specific time interval of duration $T_p$ seconds. At all times outside this interval, the voltage of the pulse is zero. The energy of signals is a critical parameter in communications, as it relates to the power required for transmission and the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. For a voltage signal $x(t)$ measured across a 1-ohm resistor, its total energy $E$ is defined by the integral $E = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x(t)|^{2} dt$.\n\nYour task is to determine the total energy of this single rectangular pulse. Provide a closed-form analytic expression for the energy $E$ in terms of the pulse amplitude $A$ and its duration $T_p$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total energy of a single rectangular pulse $p(t)$ with amplitude $A$ and duration $T_p$. The energy $E$ of a signal is given by the formula $E = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |p(t)|^{2} dt$.\n\nFirst, we must mathematically represent the rectangular pulse $p(t)$. The problem states that the pulse has a constant amplitude $A$ for a duration of $T_p$ and is zero otherwise. For the purpose of calculation, we can center this pulse at the time origin $t=0$ without any loss of generality, as the energy calculation is independent of the pulse's position in time. The mathematical description of such a pulse is:\n$$\np(t) = \\begin{cases} A & \\text{for } -\\frac{T_p}{2} \\le t \\le \\frac{T_p}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe duration of the non-zero portion of the pulse is indeed $(\\frac{T_p}{2}) - (-\\frac{T_p}{2}) = T_p$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this definition of $p(t)$ into the energy integral:\n$$\nE = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |p(t)|^{2} dt\n$$\nSince the function $p(t)$ is non-zero only in the interval $[-\\frac{T_p}{2}, \\frac{T_p}{2}]$, we can change the limits of integration accordingly. The integrals over the regions where $p(t)=0$ will contribute zero to the total energy.\n$$\nE = \\int_{-T_p/2}^{T_p/2} |A|^{2} dt\n$$\nThe amplitude $A$ is a real, constant value, so $|A|^2 = A^2$. We can treat $A^2$ as a constant factor and pull it out of the integral.\n$$\nE = A^2 \\int_{-T_p/2}^{T_p/2} 1 \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the definite integral:\n$$\nE = A^2 \\left[ t \\right]_{-T_p/2}^{T_p/2}\n$$\nSubstituting the limits of integration:\n$$\nE = A^2 \\left( \\left(\\frac{T_p}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{T_p}{2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the parentheses:\n$$\nE = A^2 \\left( \\frac{T_p}{2} + \\frac{T_p}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE = A^2 (T_p)\n$$\nThus, the total energy of the single rectangular pulse is the product of the square of its amplitude and its duration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A^2 T_p}$$", "id": "1745849"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the individual pulse, we now turn to the complete PAM signal and the crucial process of reconstruction.
