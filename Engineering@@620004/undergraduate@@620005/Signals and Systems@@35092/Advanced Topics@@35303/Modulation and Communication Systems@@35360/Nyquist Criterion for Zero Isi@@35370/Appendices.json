To recover the $n$-th symbol, $a_n$, the receiver samples the signal at the time instant $t = nT_s$.

For the ISI to be zero for any arbitrary sequence of data symbols $\\{a_k\\}$, the pulse response $p(t)$ must satisfy the following condition:\n$$p(m T_s) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all non-zero integers } m \\in \\{\\dots, -2, -1, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$$\nAdditionally, for the desired signal component to be non-zero, we must have $p(0) \\neq 0$. This is the time-domain Nyquist criterion for zero ISI.\n\nNow, we must test if the given pulse $p(t)$ and symbol period $T_s = W$ satisfy this criterion. The pulse is defined as:\n$p(t) = A \\left( 1 - \\frac{|t|}{W} \\right)$ for $|t| \\le W$, and $p(t) = 0$ for $|t| > W$.\n\nLet's evaluate $p(m T_s) = p(mW)$ for integer values of $m$:\nFor $m=0$:\nThe sampling instant is $t=0$. Since $|0| \\le W$, we use the first part of the definition:\n$p(0) = A \\left( 1 - \\frac{|0|}{W} \\right) = A$. As $A$ is a positive constant, $p(0) \\neq 0$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nFor $m=1$:\nThe sampling instant is $t = 1 \\cdot T_s = W$. This is at the boundary of the pulse definition where $|t|=W$.\n$p(W) = A \\left( 1 - \\frac{|W|}{W} \\right) = A(1 - 1) = 0$.

This is at the other boundary where $|t|=W$.\n$p(-W) = A \\left( 1 - \\frac{|-W|}{W} \\right) = A(1 - 1) = 0$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nFor any integer $m$ where $|m| \\ge 2$:\nThe sampling instant is $t = m T_s = mW$. The absolute value is $|t| = |m|W$. Since $|m| \\ge 2$, we have $|mW| > W$. For arguments with absolute value greater than $W$, the pulse is defined to be zero.\nTherefore, $p(mW) = 0$ for all integers $m$ such that $|m| \\ge 2$.\n\nCombining these results, we see that $p(m T_s) = 0$ for all non-zero integers $m$, and $p(0)=A \\neq 0$. The Nyquist criterion for zero ISI is fully satisfied. Thus, the system does achieve zero ISI.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n- A. Yes, because the pulse has a finite duration. This is incorrect reasoning. A rectangular pulse also has finite duration, but for $T_s=W$ (where the total width is $2W$), it would cause significant ISI.\n- B. Yes, because the pulse shape and symbol period together satisfy the time-domain condition for zero ISI. Our derivation confirms this is the correct statement.\n- C. No, because a triangular pulse is not a sinc pulse. This is false. While the sinc pulse is the canonical example of a Nyquist pulse, it is not the only one. Any pulse satisfying the time-domain condition is a Nyquist pulse for the given rate. The triangular pulse is another such example.\n- D. No, because the frequency spectrum of a triangular pulse is not strictly band-limited. This is irrelevant to the zero ISI condition being met. The Nyquist criterion can be satisfied by pulses that are not band-limited, like the raised-cosine family of pulses.\n- E. No, because at a symbol period of $T_s=W$, adjacent pulses overlap. It is true that pulses overlap (e.g., the pulse starting at $t=0$ extends to $t=W$, while the pulse starting at $t=T_s=W$ begins at that same instant). However, the overlap is structured such that the interference at the specific sampling instants is zero.
