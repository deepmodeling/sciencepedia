This practice focuses on the fundamental characteristic of a VSB signal: its spectral footprint. By calculating the transmission bandwidth, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how VSB conserves spectrum compared to DSB while still accommodating the crucial low-frequency content of the message signal [@problem_id:1773018].", "problem": "A legacy analog broadcasting system is designed to transmit a monochrome video signal, $m(t)$, using Vestigial-Sideband (VSB) modulation. This technique is chosen as a compromise to conserve spectral bandwidth while ensuring the robust transmission of important low-frequency signal components. The baseband video signal has a bandwidth of $W$.\n\nThe modulation process first creates a double-sideband signal centered at a carrier frequency $f_c$. A specialized VSB filter is then applied. This filter is designed to pass one of the sidebands completely. To preserve the crucial signal information near DC, the filter also allows a portion of the other sideband to pass through. This remaining portion is known as the vestigial band. The system's design specifications dictate that the width of this vestigial band, $W_v$, is a fraction of the original message bandwidth, given by the relation $W_v = \\beta W$, where $\\beta$ is a dimensionless filter design factor satisfying $0 < \\beta < 1$.\n\nAssuming the carrier frequency is much greater than the message bandwidth ($f_c \\gg W$), determine the total transmission bandwidth, $B_T$, required for the VSB-modulated signal. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $W$ and $\\beta$.", "solution": "Let the message signal be $m(t)$ with a Fourier transform $M(f)$. The problem states that the bandwidth of this signal is $W$. This means that $M(f)$ is zero for $|f| > W$.\n\nThe first step in generating a VSB signal is to create a double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSB-SC) signal by multiplying the message signal with a carrier wave $\\cos(2\\pi f_c t)$. The spectrum of this DSB-SC signal, $S_{DSB}(f)$, is given by:\n$$S_{DSB}(f) = \\frac{1}{2}[M(f - f_c) + M(f + f_c)]$$\nThis spectrum consists of two sidebands around the carrier frequency $f_c$ (for $f > 0$).\nThe upper sideband (USB) occupies the frequency range from $f_c$ to $f_c + W$.\nThe lower sideband (LSB) occupies the frequency range from $f_c - W$ to $f_c$.\nThe total bandwidth of the DSB-SC signal would be $(f_c + W) - (f_c - W) = 2W$.\n\nVSB modulation involves filtering this DSB-SC signal. The problem states that the VSB filter passes one full sideband and a vestige of the other. Let's assume the system is designed to pass the full upper sideband. The highest frequency component in the transmitted signal's spectrum, $f_{max}$, will therefore correspond to the highest frequency in the USB.\n$$f_{max} = f_c + W$$\n\nIn addition to the full USB, a vestigial portion of the LSB is also passed. The problem specifies that the width of this vestigial band is $W_v = \\beta W$. This band is adjacent to the carrier frequency within the LSB region. Therefore, the filter passes frequencies down to $f_c - W_v$. The lowest frequency component present in the transmitted signal's spectrum (for $f > 0$), $f_{min}$, is:\n$$f_{min} = f_c - W_v = f_c - \\beta W$$\n\nThe total transmission bandwidth, $B_T$, is the difference between the highest and lowest frequency components in the signal's spectrum.\n$$B_T = f_{max} - f_{min}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{max}$ and $f_{min}$:\n$$B_T = (f_c + W) - (f_c - \\beta W)$$\n$$B_T = f_c + W - f_c + \\beta W$$\n$$B_T = W + \\beta W$$\nFactoring out $W$, we get the final expression for the transmission bandwidth:\n$$B_T = W(1 + \\beta)$$\nThis result shows that the VSB bandwidth is greater than the message bandwidth $W$ (like SSB) but less than the DSB bandwidth $2W$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{W(1 + \\beta)}$$", "id": "1773018"}, {"introduction": "The ability to perfectly reconstruct a message signal from its VSB counterpart is not accidental; it depends entirely on a clever filter design. This principle is captured in the vestigial symmetry condition, which ensures that spectral components removed from one sideband are compensated for by those left in the other. This exercise challenges you to mathematically verify this critical symmetry for a given filter, providing insight into the elegant engineering required for distortionless VSB demodulation [@problem_id:1773026].", "problem": "In a communication system using Vestigial-Sideband (VSB) modulation, the transmitted signal is created by modulating a message signal and passing it through a special filter. For distortionless recovery of the message using a synchronous demodulator, the VSB filter's transfer function, $H(\\omega)$, must satisfy a key symmetry property. This property requires that the effective transfer function for the message, defined as $H_{eff}(\\nu) = H(\\omega_c + \\nu) + H(\\omega_c - \\nu)$, must be a constant for all frequencies within the message bandwidth, i.e., for $|\\nu| \\le W$.

Therefore, the condition must hold for all $|\\nu| \\le \\omega_v$. Let's test this condition using the given filter transfer function $H(\\omega)$. Due to the symmetry of the expression with respect to $\\nu$, we only need to check for $0 \\le \\nu \\le \\omega_v$.
