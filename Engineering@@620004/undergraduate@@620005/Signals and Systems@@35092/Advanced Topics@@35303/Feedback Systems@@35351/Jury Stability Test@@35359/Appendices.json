A discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system is stable if and only if all the poles of its transfer function (i.e., the roots of its characteristic polynomial) have a magnitude less than 1.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the overall system is given as:\n$$P(z) = z^3 - 0.7z^2 + 0.16z - 0.012$$\n\nWe are told that one of the poles is at $z = 0.2$. This means that $(z - 0.2)$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(z)$. To find the polynomial corresponding to the remaining poles, we can perform polynomial long division to divide $P(z)$ by $(z - 0.2)$.\n\nLet the remaining polynomial be $Q(z) = \\frac{P(z)}{z - 0.2}$.\n\nThe long division is as follows:\n```\n        z^2   - 0.5z   + 0.06\n      _________________________\nz-0.2 | z^3 - 0.7z^2 + 0.16z - 0.012\n      -(z^3 - 0.2z^2)\n      _________________________\n            -0.5z^2 + 0.16z\n          -(-0.5z^2 + 0.10z)\n          _________________________\n                      0.06z - 0.012\n                    -(0.06z - 0.012)\n                    _________________________\n                                0 \n```\nThe division results in a remainder of zero, confirming that $(z-0.2)$ is indeed a factor. The quotient polynomial, which represents the remaining subsystem, is:\n$$Q(z) = z^2 - 0.5z + 0.06$$\n\nNow, we must determine the stability of the system represented by $Q(z)$. We can do this by checking if the roots of $Q(z)$ lie within the unit circle. The Jury stability test provides a method for this without explicitly calculating the roots.\n\nFor a second-order polynomial $Q(z) = a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0$, with $a_2 = 1$, $a_1 = -0.5$, and $a_0 = 0.06$, the Jury stability conditions are sufficient and are:\n1.  $Q(1)  0$\n2.  $(-1)^n Q(-1)  0$, where $n=2$ is the order of the polynomial.\n3.  $|a_0|  a_n$\n\nLet's check each condition for $Q(z) = z^2 - 0.5z + 0.06$:\n\n**Condition 1:**\n$$Q(1) = (1)^2 - 0.5(1) + 0.06 = 1 - 0.5 + 0.06 = 0.56$$\nSince $0.56  0$, the first condition is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 2:**\nThe condition is $(-1)^2 Q(-1)  0$, which simplifies to $Q(-1)  0$.\n$$Q(-1) = (-1)^2 - 0.5(-1) + 0.06 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.06 = 1.56$$\nSince $1.56  0$, the second condition is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 3:**\nThe condition is $|a_0|  a_2$. Here, $a_0 = 0.06$ and $a_2 = 1$.\n$$|0.06|  1$$\nThis is true, so the third condition is satisfied.\n\nSince all three conditions of the Jury test are met, both poles of the subsystem represented by $Q(z)$ lie inside the unit circle. Therefore, the remaining subsystem is stable.\n\nAlternatively, we could find the roots of $Q(z)$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$z = \\frac{-a_1 \\pm \\sqrt{a_1^2 - 4a_2 a_0}}{2a_2} = \\frac{0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.5)^2 - 4(1)(0.06)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$z = \\frac{0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{0.25 - 0.24}}{2} = \\frac{0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{0.01}}{2} = \\frac{0.5 \\pm 0.1}{2}$$\nThe two remaining poles are:\n$$z_1 = \\frac{0.5 + 0.1}{2} = \\frac{0.6}{2} = 0.3$$\n$$z_2 = \\frac{0.5 - 0.1}{2} = \\frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2$$\nThe magnitudes of these poles are $|z_1| = 0.3$ and $|z_2| = 0.2$. Both are less than 1, confirming that the remaining subsystem is stable. The initial pole was at $z=0.2$, so the full system has poles at $0.2, 0.2, 0.3$, all of which are inside the unit circle, making the overall system stable as well.

First, the preliminary necessary conditions for stability:\n1. The coefficient of the highest power term, $a_0$, must be positive. Here, $a_0=2 > 0$, so this condition holds.\n2. The magnitude of the constant term must be less than the coefficient of the highest power term: $|a_4|  a_0$. This gives $|\\frac{1}{5}|  2$, which is true.\n3. $P(1) > 0$:\n$$P(1)=2+\\frac{3}{2}+0-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{5}=1+2+\\frac{1}{5}=3+\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{16}{5}>0$$\nThis also holds.\n4.
