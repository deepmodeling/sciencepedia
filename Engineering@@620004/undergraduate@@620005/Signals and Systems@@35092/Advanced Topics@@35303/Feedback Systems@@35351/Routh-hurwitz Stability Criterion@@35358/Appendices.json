The process involves constructing a Routh array from the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, $P(s) = s^5 + s^4 + 4s^3 + 4s^2 + 3s + 3$.\n\nFirst, we set up the first two rows of the Routh array using the coefficients of the polynomial. The first row contains the coefficients of the odd powers of $s$, and the second row contains the coefficients of the even powers of $s$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^5 & 1 & 4 & 3 \\\\\ns^4 & 1 & 4 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients for the $s^3$ row. Let the rows be denoted by their corresponding power of $s$. The coefficients are calculated as follows:\nThe first element of the $s^3$ row is $b_1 = -\\frac{1}{a_{2,1}} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} \\\\ a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} \\end{vmatrix}$, where $a_{n,m}$ is the element in the $n$-th row and $m$-th column of the coefficient part of the array.\n\nFor the $s^3$ row:\n$b_1 = -\\frac{1}{1} \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 4 \\end{vmatrix} = -(1 \\cdot 4 - 1 \\cdot 4) = 0$\n$b_2 = -\\frac{1}{1} \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{vmatrix} = -(1 \\cdot 3 - 1 \\cdot 3) = 0$\n$b_3 = -\\frac{1}{1} \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = 0$\n\nSince all the elements in the $s^3$ row are zero, this indicates a special case. A row of zeros signifies that there are roots of the characteristic equation that are symmetric with respect to the origin of the s-plane. These symmetric roots could be on the imaginary axis, on the real axis, or in complex conjugate quadruplets. To find these roots, we form an auxiliary polynomial, $A(s)$, using the coefficients from the row just above the row of zeros (the $s^4$ row).\n\nThe coefficients in the $s^4$ row are $\\{1, 4, 3\\}$. The auxiliary polynomial is formed with these coefficients and descending even powers of $s$, starting from the power of the row, which is $s^4$.\n$$A(s) = 1 \\cdot s^4 + 4 \\cdot s^2 + 3 \\cdot s^0 = s^4 + 4s^2 + 3$$\n\nThe roots of the auxiliary polynomial $A(s)$ are also roots of the original characteristic equation $P(s)$. We can find the roots of $A(s)$ by solving $A(s) = 0$.\n$$s^4 + 4s^2 + 3 = 0$$\nLet $u = s^2$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $u$:\n$$u^2 + 4u + 3 = 0$$\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as:\n$$(u + 1)(u + 3) = 0$$\nThis gives us two solutions for $u$: $u = -1$ and $u = -3$.\n\nNow, we substitute back $s^2 = u$ to find the roots in terms of $s$.\nCase 1: $s^2 = -1$\n$$s = \\pm \\sqrt{-1} = \\pm j$$\nCase 2: $s^2 = -3$\n$$s = \\pm \\sqrt{-3} = \\pm j\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nBoth sets of roots, $\\{j, -j\\}$ and $\\{j\\sqrt{3}, -j\\sqrt{3}\\}$, are purely imaginary and lie on the $j\\omega$-axis. Therefore, the complete set of roots of the characteristic equation on the imaginary axis is $\\{j, -j, j\\sqrt{3}, -j\\sqrt{3}\\}$.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nFor completeness, we can check the stability of the remaining roots. The original polynomial $P(s)$ can be factored by dividing it by the auxiliary polynomial $A(s)$:\n$P(s) = A(s) \\cdot Q(s) = (s^4 + 4s^2 + 3) \\cdot Q(s)$.\nLong division confirms that $P(s) = (s^4 + 4s^2 + 3)(s+1)$.\nThe roots of $P(s)$ are the roots of $A(s)$ and the roots of $Q(s) = s+1$.\nThe root of $s+1=0$ is $s=-1$, which is in the left-half plane.\nSince the remaining root is in the left-half plane and the other four roots are on the imaginary axis (with multiplicity one), the system is marginally stable. The question asks only for the roots on the imaginary axis, which we have found to be $\\{j, -j, j\\sqrt{3}, -j\\sqrt{3}\\}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from analysis to design, using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion as a tool for synthesis.
