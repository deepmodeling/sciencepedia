The relationship depends on the specific input signal $x(t)$ and cannot be determined in general.", "solution": "The solution to this problem lies in analyzing the signals in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform and applying Parseval's theorem.\n\nFirst, let's define the signals and their relationships in the frequency domain. Let $X(\\omega)$, $Y(\\omega)$, and $Z(\\omega)$ be the Fourier Transforms of $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z(t)$, respectively.\n\nThe system is an LTI filter, so its output $Y(\\omega)$ is related to its input $X(\\omega)$ by multiplication with the filter's frequency response, $H(\\omega)$.\n$$Y(\\omega) = H(\\omega)X(\\omega)$$\nThe problem describes an ideal zero-phase band-stop filter. Its frequency response $H(\\omega)$ is given by:\n$$\nH(\\omega) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0, & \\omega_1 \\le |\\omega| \\le \\omega_2 \\\\\n1, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe rejected signal is defined as $z(t) = x(t) - y(t)$. Taking the Fourier Transform of this relationship, we get:\n$$Z(\\omega) = X(\\omega) - Y(\\omega)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Y(\\omega)$:\n$$Z(\\omega) = X(\\omega) - H(\\omega)X(\\omega) = (1 - H(\\omega))X(\\omega)$$\nLet's define a new function $H_z(\\omega) = 1 - H(\\omega)$. This function represents the frequency response of a filter that would produce $z(t)$ from $x(t)$.\n$$H_z(\\omega) = 1 - H(\\omega) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 - 0 = 1, & \\omega_1 \\le |\\omega| \\le \\omega_2 \\\\\n1 - 1 = 0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis shows that $H_z(\\omega)$ is the frequency response of an ideal band-pass filter. The key observation is that the frequency bands where $H(\\omega)$ and $H_z(\\omega)$ are non-zero are mutually exclusive. That is, for any given frequency $\\omega$, either $H(\\omega)=1$ and $H_z(\\omega)=0$, or $H(\\omega)=0$ and $H_z(\\omega)=1$. Therefore, their product is always zero:\n$$H(\\omega) H_z(\\omega) = H(\\omega) (1 - H(\\omega)) = 0, \\quad \\forall \\omega$$\nNow, we use Parseval's theorem, which relates the energy of a signal in the time domain to its energy spectral density in the frequency domain. For any signal $s(t)$ with Fourier Transform $S(\\omega)$, the energy $E_s$ is:\n$$E_s = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |s(t)|^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |S(\\omega)|^2 d\\omega$$\nLet's apply this to the input signal $x(t)$. We have $x(t) = y(t) + z(t)$, which in the frequency domain is $X(\\omega) = Y(\\omega) + Z(\\omega)$. The energy of $x(t)$ is:\n$$E_x = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |X(\\omega)|^2 d\\omega = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |Y(\\omega) + Z(\\omega)|^2 d\\omega$$\nLet's expand the term inside the integral:\n$$|Y(\\omega) + Z(\\omega)|^2 = (Y(\\omega) + Z(\\omega))(Y(\\omega) + Z(\\omega))^* = |Y(\\omega)|^2 + |Z(\\omega)|^2 + Y(\\omega)Z(\\omega)^* + Y(\\omega)^*Z(\\omega)$$\nThe last two terms are $2\\text{Re}\\{Y(\\omega)Z(\\omega)^*\\}$.

We have $Y(\\omega) = H(\\omega)X(\\omega)$ and $Z(\\omega) = (1-H(\\omega))X(\\omega)$.\n$$Y(\\omega)Z(\\omega)^* = (H(\\omega)X(\\omega))((1-H(\\omega))X(\\omega))^* = H(\\omega)(1-H(\\omega))^*|X(\\omega)|^2$$\nSince $H(\\omega)$ is real-valued (it's either 0 or 1), $(1-H(\\omega))^* = (1-H(\\omega))$.\n$$Y(\\omega)Z(\\omega)^* = H(\\omega)(1-H(\\omega))|X(\\omega)|^2$$\nAs we established that $H(\\omega)(1-H(\\omega)) = 0$ for all $\\omega$, the cross-term $Y(\\omega)Z(\\omega)^*$ is zero for all $\\omega$. This means the frequency content of $y(t)$ and $z(t)$ are non-overlapping (they are orthogonal).\n\nTherefore, the magnitude-squared of the sum is the sum of the magnitude-squares:\n$$|X(\\omega)|^2 = |Y(\\omega) + Z(\\omega)|^2 = |Y(\\omega)|^2 + |Z(\\omega)|^2$$\nNow we can substitute this back into the integral for $E_x$:\n$$E_x = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (|Y(\\omega)|^2 + |Z(\\omega)|^2) d\\omega$$\nUsing the linearity of integration, we can split this into two integrals:\n$$E_x = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |Y(\\omega)|^2 d\\omega + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |Z(\\omega)|^2 d\\omega$$\nBy the definition of Parseval's theorem, these two terms are precisely the energies of $y(t)$ and $z(t)$:\n$$E_y = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |Y(\\omega)|^2 d\\omega$$\n$$E_z = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |Z(\\omega)|^2 d\\omega$$\nTherefore, we arrive at the final relationship:\n$$E_x = E_y + E_z$$\nThis result is general and holds for any finite-energy input signal $x(t)$.
