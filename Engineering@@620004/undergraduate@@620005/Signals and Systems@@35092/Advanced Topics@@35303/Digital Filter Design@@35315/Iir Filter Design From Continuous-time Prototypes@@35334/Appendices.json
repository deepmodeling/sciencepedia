This exercise, [@problem_id:1726036], asks you to identify the $z$-plane equivalent of the analog DC point ($s=0$), a crucial step in ensuring the low-frequency behavior of the prototype is preserved in the final digital filter.", "problem": "In the design of digital Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, a common technique is to transform a well-understood analog filter prototype into a digital filter. Consider a digital signal processing engineer who is using the bilinear transform for this purpose. The relationship between the complex frequency variable $s$ of the analog domain and the complex variable $z$ of the digital domain is given by the formula:\n$$s = \\frac{2}{T} \\left( \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}} \\right)$$\nwhere $T$ is the sampling period of the digital system.\n\nThe engineer wants to ensure that the low-frequency behavior of the filter is correctly translated from the analog prototype to the digital filter. The gain of the analog filter at Direct Current (DC), which represents its response to a constant input, is determined by evaluating its transfer function $H_a(s)$ at $s=0$.

The bilinear transform provides a mapping between the $s$-plane (used for continuous-time systems) and the $z$-plane (used for discrete-time systems).\n\nThe given relationship is:\n$$s = \\frac{2}{T} \\left( \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}} \\right)$$\n\nWe are interested in the specific case where $s=0$, which corresponds to the Direct Current (DC) frequency in the analog domain. To find the corresponding point in the $z$-plane, we substitute $s=0$ into the equation:\n$$0 = \\frac{2}{T} \\left( \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}} \\right)$$\n\nFor this equation to be true, the term on the right-hand side must be zero. The constant factor $\\frac{2}{T}$ is non-zero, as the sampling period $T$ must be a finite, positive value. Therefore, the fractional part must be equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}} = 0$$\n\nA fraction is equal to zero if and only if its numerator is zero and its denominator is non-zero.\nSetting the numerator to zero gives:\n$$1 - z^{-1} = 0$$\nThis implies $z^{-1} = 1$, which gives $z=1$.\n\nWe must also verify that the denominator is not zero at this value of $z$. The denominator is $1+z^{-1}$. At $z=1$, we have $z^{-1}=1$, so the denominator is $1+1=2$. Since the denominator is 2 (which is non-zero), our solution $z=1$ is valid.\n\nThis result shows that the point $s=0$ in the $s$-plane maps to the point $z=1$ in the $z$-plane, regardless of the sampling period $T$. This is a fundamental property of the bilinear transform. It ensures that the DC gain of the analog prototype filter is mapped to the DC gain of the resulting digital filter, as the point $z=1$ corresponds to the zero frequency point ($\\omega=0$) on the unit circle in the z-plane ($z = e^{j\\omega T} \\implies z = e^{j \\cdot 0 \\cdot T} = e^0 = 1$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA. $z = 1$ (Matches our result)\nB. $z = -1$ (Incorrect)\nC. $z = 0$ (Incorrect)\nD. $z = j$ (Incorrect)\nE.

The design process starts with a continuous-time (analog) prototype filter, and its characteristics are then transformed into the discrete-time domain. The chosen transformation technique is the impulse invariance method, where the impulse response of the digital filter, $h[n]$, is a scaled, sampled version of the analog filter's impulse response, $h_a(t)$, such that $h[n] = T h_a(nT)$, where $T$ is the sampling period.\n\nThe engineer selects a practical analog high-pass filter as the prototype.

Hence C is false.\n- Aliasing affects both magnitude and phase across the entire band; it is not confined exclusively to the passband nor does it spare the stopband. Hence D is false.\n- Impulse invariance does not transform a high-pass filter into an all-pass filter; the selectivity is distorted by aliasing but not converted to all-pass.
