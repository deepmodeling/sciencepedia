One such design technique is the impulse invariance method, where the digital filter's impulse response is created by sampling the impulse response of a continuous-time analog filter.\n\nConsider a stable, second-order, low-pass analog filter with real-valued coefficients, given by the transfer function:\n$$H_1(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{(s - \\sigma_0)^2 + \\omega_0^2}$$\nwhere $\\sigma_0$ and $\\omega_0$ are real constants representing filter parameters, with the constraints $\\sigma_0 < 0$ and $\\omega_0 > 0$. This filter's DC gain is unity.\n\nThis filter is used as a prototype to design a digital filter $H(z)$ using the impulse invariance method with a sampling period $T_s$.\n\nIt turns out that there exists a different stable, second-order analog filter, $H_2(s)$, which has a distinct band-pass frequency response characteristic, yet produces the exact same digital filter $H(z)$ when the same impulse invariance design process is applied with the same sampling period $T_s$.\n\nDetermine the transfer function for one such filter, $H_2(s)$. Your final answer should be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $s$, $\\sigma_0$, $\\omega_0$, and $T_s$.", "solution": "The core principle of the impulse invariance method is that the impulse response of the digital filter, $h_d[n]$, is a sampled version of the analog filter's impulse response, $h_a(t)$. That is, $h_d[n] = h_a(nT_s)$, where $T_s$ is the sampling period.\n\nFor two different analog filters, $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$, to produce the identical digital filter $H(z)$, their respective impulse responses, $h_1(t)$ and $h_2(t)$, must yield the same sampled sequence. Therefore, the condition is:\n$$h_1(nT_s) = h_2(nT_s) \\quad \\text{for all integers } n \\ge 0$$\nNote that this does not imply that $h_1(t)$ must equal $h_2(t)$ for all $t$.\n\nFirst, we find the impulse response $h_1(t)$ corresponding to the given low-pass filter $H_1(s)$.\nThe transfer function is:\n$$H_1(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{(s - \\sigma_0)^2 + \\omega_0^2}$$\nThis form can be related to the Laplace transform pair $\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}\\sin(bt)u(t)\\} = \\frac{b}{(s-a)^2 + b^2}$.\nWe can rewrite $H_1(s)$ as:\n$$H_1(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega_0}{(s - \\sigma_0)^2 + \\omega_0^2}$$\nApplying the inverse Laplace transform, we find the impulse response $h_1(t)$:\n$$h_1(t) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 t} \\sin(\\omega_0 t) u(t)$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n\nNext, we sample this impulse response at intervals of $T_s$:\n$$h_1(nT_s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 n T_s} \\sin(\\omega_0 n T_s) \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 0$$\n\nNow, we need to find a different continuous-time impulse response, $h_2(t)$, such that $h_2(nT_s) = h_1(nT_s)$. The key lies in the periodic nature of the sampled sinusoidal function. The sine function has the property that $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + 2\\pi k)$ for any integer $k$.\nLet's consider the term $\\sin(\\omega_0 n T_s)$. We can define a new frequency, $\\omega_1$, such that $\\sin(\\omega_1 n T_s) = \\sin(\\omega_0 n T_s)$ for all integers $n$.\nThis equality holds if:\n$$\\omega_1 n T_s = \\omega_0 n T_s + 2\\pi k n$$\nfor some non-zero integer $k$. Dividing by $n T_s$ (for $n \\neq 0$), we get:\n$$\\omega_1 = \\omega_0 + \\frac{2\\pi k}{T_s}$$\nTo create a filter that is different from $H_1(s)$, we must choose $k \\neq 0$. The problem specifies that $H_2(s)$ should have a band-pass characteristic. A band-pass filter generally has a resonance at a higher frequency than a comparable low-pass filter. This suggests picking a positive integer for $k$ to increase the frequency. The simplest choice is $k=1$. Let's define our new frequency:\n$$\\omega_1 = \\omega_0 + \\frac{2\\pi}{T_s}$$\n\nWe can now construct the impulse response $h_2(t)$. It must have the same exponential decay envelope and the same amplitude scaling as $h_1(t)$ to match at the sampling instants, but with the new sinusoidal frequency $\\omega_1$:\n$$h_2(t) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 t} \\sin(\\omega_1 t) u(t)$$\nLet's verify that $h_2(nT_s) = h_1(nT_s)$:\n$$h_2(nT_s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 n T_s} \\sin(\\omega_1 n T_s)$$\n$$h_2(nT_s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 n T_s} \\sin\\left(\\left(\\omega_0 + \\frac{2\\pi}{T_s}\\right) n T_s\\right)$$\n$$h_2(nT_s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 n T_s} \\sin(\\omega_0 n T_s + 2\\pi n)$$\nSince $n$ is an integer, $2\\pi n$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, so $\\sin(\\omega_0 n T_s + 2\\pi n) = \\sin(\\omega_0 n T_s)$.\n$$h_2(nT_s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 n T_s} \\sin(\\omega_0 n T_s) = h_1(nT_s)$$\nThe condition is satisfied.\n\nFinally, we find the transfer function $H_2(s)$ by taking the Laplace transform of $h_2(t)$:\n$$H_2(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h_2(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{ \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} e^{\\sigma_0 t} \\sin(\\omega_1 t) u(t) \\right\\}$$\nUsing the same Laplace transform pair as before:\n$$H_2(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} \\left[ \\frac{\\omega_1}{(s - \\sigma_0)^2 + \\omega_1^2} \\right]$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_1$:\n$$H_2(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + \\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0} \\frac{\\omega_0 + \\frac{2\\pi}{T_s}}{(s - \\sigma_0)^2 + \\left(\\omega_0 + \\frac{2\\pi}{T_s}\\right)^2}$$\nThis is the transfer function for a stable ($\\sigma_0<0$), second-order filter.
