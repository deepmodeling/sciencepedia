This practice [@problem_id:1697493] presents a fascinating thought experiment: what is the output if an ideal low-pass filter processes a signal identical to its own impulse response?

Your final answer should be a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $t$ and $\\omega_c$.", "solution": "The output signal $y(t)$ of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system is given by the convolution of the input signal $x(t)$ with the system's impulse response $h(t)$.\n$$y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$$\nIn this problem, the input signal is specified to be the same as the impulse response, so we have $x(t) = h(t)$. Therefore, the output is the self-convolution of the impulse response:\n$$y(t) = h(t) * h(t)$$\nWhile this convolution can be computed directly in the time domain, it is much simpler to work in the frequency domain. The Convolution Theorem states that convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain. Let $Y(j\\omega)$, $X(j\\omega)$, and $H(j\\omega)$ be the Fourier Transforms of $y(t)$, $x(t)$, and $h(t)$, respectively.\n$$Y(j\\omega) = X(j\\omega) H(j\\omega)$$\nSince $x(t) = h(t)$, their Fourier Transforms must also be equal, $X(j\\omega) = H(j\\omega)$. Substituting this into the frequency-domain relation gives:\n$$Y(j\\omega) = H(j\\omega) \\cdot H(j\\omega) = [H(j\\omega)]^2$$\nNow, we must find the frequency response $H(j\\omega)$, which is the Fourier Transform of the given impulse response $h(t) = \\frac{\\sin(\\omega_c t)}{\\pi t}$. This is a standard Fourier Transform pair corresponding to an ideal low-pass filter. The frequency response $H(j\\omega)$ is a rectangular pulse defined as:\n$$H(j\\omega) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } |\\omega| \\le \\omega_c \\\\ 0  \\text{if } |\\omega|  \\omega_c \\end{cases}$$\nNext, we compute the spectrum of the output signal, $Y(j\\omega) = [H(j\\omega)]^2$. Since the function $H(j\\omega)$ only takes the values 0 and 1, squaring it does not change its value:\n$$[H(j\\omega)]^2 = \\begin{cases} 1^2  \\text{if } |\\omega| \\le \\omega_c \\\\ 0^2  \\text{if } |\\omega|  \\omega_c \\end{cases} = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } |\\omega| \\le \\omega_c \\\\ 0  \\text{if } |\\omega|  \\omega_c \\end{cases}$$\nThus, we find that the output spectrum is identical to the filter's frequency response:\n$$Y(j\\omega) = H(j\\omega)$$\nTo find the output signal $y(t)$ in the time domain, we take the inverse Fourier Transform of $Y(j\\omega)$.
