A higher order requires more components (e.g., op-amps, resistors, capacitors), increasing physical size, cost, and sensitivity to component tolerances. For the given specifications, the Chebyshev filter requires order $N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 7$, whereas the Butterworth requires a significantly higher order $N_{\\mathrm{B}} = 11$. This substantial difference makes the Chebyshev filter far more efficient and less complex to implement.\n2.  **Passband Characteristics**: The Butterworth filter is \"maximally flat,\" meaning its magnitude response is monotonic and has the flattest possible response at $\\Omega = 0$. This is desirable in applications intolerant to gain variation across the passband, such as high-fidelity audio or precision instrumentation. The Chebyshev filter achieves its steep transition band at the cost of introducing equiripple behavior in the passband. In this case, the response fluctuates between $0$ dB and $A_p = 1$ dB of attenuation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Chebyshev prototype offers a much sharper cutoff for a given order, or conversely, a much lower order for given attenuation specifications. The steep stopband requirement of $A_s = 60$ dB highlights this advantage, as the required order for the Butterworth filter is substantially higher. While the $1$ dB passband ripple of the Chebyshev filter is a disadvantage, the significant reduction in order from $11$ to $7$ represents a major improvement in implementation efficiency. Therefore, unless the application has an absolute requirement for passband flatness that cannot tolerate a $1$ dB variation, the Chebyshev Type I prototype is the superior and more practical choice for these specifications.\n\nThe calculation of the final answer is as derived above.\n$$ \\Delta N = N_{\\mathrm{B}} - N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 11 - 7 = 4 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "2877770"}]}
