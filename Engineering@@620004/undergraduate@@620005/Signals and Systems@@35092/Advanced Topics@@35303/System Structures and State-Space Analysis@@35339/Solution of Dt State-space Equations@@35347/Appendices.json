Note that since $n \\ge 2$, the index $n-2$ is non-negative, so $k=n-2 \\ge 0$ is a valid index in the sum.\n\nFor the third to last term of the sum, $k=n-3$:\nThe exponent is $n-1-k = n-1-(n-3) = 2$. The matrix term is $A^2 = 0$.\nFor any $k  n-2$, the exponent $n-1-k$ will be greater than 1. For example, for $k=n-3$, the exponent is 2; for $k=n-4$, the exponent is 3, and so on.
