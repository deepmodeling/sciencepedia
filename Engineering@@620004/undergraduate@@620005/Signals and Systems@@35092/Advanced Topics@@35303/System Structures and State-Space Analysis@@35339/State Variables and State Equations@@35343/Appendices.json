The temperature of the component, $T(t)$, is influenced by its internal power generation and heat dissipation to the surroundings, which are at a constant ambient temperature $T_\\text{amb}$. The component's thermal behavior is described by its thermal capacitance $C$ and its thermal conductance to the ambient environment $G$.\n\nThe state variable of the system is defined as the temperature difference above ambient, $x(t) = T(t) - T_\\text{amb}$. The dynamics of this state variable are governed by the first-order linear differential equation:\n$$ C \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + G x(t) = P_\\text{in}(t) $$\nwhere $P_\\text{in}(t)$ is the power generated by the component.\n\nFor this analysis, assume the component has a thermal capacitance $C = 1.0 \\, \\text{J/K}$ and a thermal conductance $G = 2.0 \\, \\text{W/K}$.
