It is defined as:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} kn}$$\n\nThe crucial point is that the DFT operation implicitly assumes the signal is either periodic with period N or is zero outside the interval $n \\in [0, N-1]$. The relationship between the N-point DFT and the DTFT is that the DFT coefficients, $X[k]$, are samples of the DTFT of a related signal, not necessarily the original signal $x[n]$.\n\nThe DFT samples are taken at the discrete frequencies $\\omega_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{N}$. For a 6-point DFT, as in this problem, $N=6$. The frequencies are:\n$$\\omega_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{6} = \\frac{\\pi k}{3} \\quad \\text{for } k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$\n\nAlice's claim concerns the frequency $\\omega_0 = \\pi/3$. We can see that this corresponds exactly to the DFT sampling frequency for $k=1$:\n$$\\omega_1 = \\frac{\\pi(1)}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$$\n\nSo, Alice is essentially claiming that $X[1] = X(e^{j\\omega})|_{\\omega=\\pi/3}$. Let's investigate when this is true.\n\nThe N-point DFT, $X[k]$, is formally the DTFT of the finite-length sequence $x_w[n]$ which is the original sequence $x[n]$ windowed by a rectangular window of length $N$. That is, $x_w[n] = x[n]$ for $0 \\le n \\le N-1$ and $x_w[n]=0$ otherwise. So, $X[k]$ are samples of $X_w(e^{j\\omega})$, not necessarily $X(e^{j\\omega})$.\n\n$$X[k] = X_w(e^{j\\omega})|_{\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi k}{N}} = \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j\\omega n} \\right)_{\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi k}{N}}$$\n\nThe relationship $X_w(e^{j\\omega}) = X(e^{j\\omega})$ holds if and only if the windowing operation does not alter the signal. This occurs only when the original signal $x[n]$ is already zero outside the window. In this case, for $N=6$, this means $x[n]$ must be zero for all $n < 0$ and for all $n \\ge 6$.\n\nIf this condition is met, then $x[n]$ is a finite-duration sequence of length at most 6. Its DTFT is:\n$$X(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{5} x[n] e^{-j\\omega n}$$\nThe 6-point DFT is:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{5} x[n] e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi}{6} kn}$$\nBy comparing these two expressions, it's clear that if the signal is zero outside the range $[0, 5]$, then $X[k]$ is simply $X(e^{j\\omega})$ evaluated at $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi k}{6}$.\nThus, if $X(e^{j\\pi/3}) = 0$ AND the signal is zero outside $n \\in [0, 5]$, then it must be true that $X[1] = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n- **A (Always correct):** This is incorrect. If $x[n]$ is an infinite-length sequence (e.g., $x[n] = a^n u[n]$ with $|a|<1$), the DFT operation involves time-domain aliasing. The DFT samples correspond to samples of the DTFT of a time-aliased version of $x[n]$, which is not the same as $X(e^{j\\omega})$. This phenomenon is also known as spectral leakage from the windowing perspective. Even if $X(e^{j\\pi/3})=0$, contributions from other frequencies can \"leak\" into the DFT bin at $k=1$, making $X[1] \\neq 0$.\n- **B (Real-valued sequence):** The property of $x[n]$ being real implies that its Fourier transform has conjugate symmetry, i.e., $X(e^{j\\omega}) = X^*(e^{-j\\omega})$. This does not prevent time-domain aliasing or spectral leakage. It is irrelevant to the core issue.\n- **D (Absolutely summable):** This condition, $\\sum |x[n]| < \\infty$, is a sufficient condition for the DTFT $X(e^{j\\omega})$ to converge and be a continuous function of $\\omega$. However, it does not imply that the signal is finite in duration. Many infinite-duration signals are absolutely summable. Thus, this condition is not sufficient to prevent time-domain aliasing in the DFT.\n- **E (Never correct):** This is incorrect because, as shown above, the claim is correct under the condition of finite duration.\n\nTherefore, Bob is right, and Alice's claim is only guaranteed to be true under the specific condition that the sequence $x[n]$ is time-limited to a duration that is less than or equal to the DFT length.
