One common non-invasive measurement is the Photoplethysmogram (PPG), which detects blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue and is often used in pulse oximeters to estimate heart rate and blood oxygen saturation.\n\nFor a preliminary frequency analysis, a periodic PPG signal from a healthy subject at rest is simplified and modeled as a train of rectangular pulses. This idealized signal, $v(t)$, represents the voltage output from the sensor. Each cycle corresponds to one heartbeat.\n\nThe model is defined by the following parameters:\n- The period of the signal is $T = 0.850$ s, corresponding to the time between consecutive heartbeats.\n- Within each period, the signal is a single rectangular pulse of amplitude $A = 1.60$ V. The voltage is $A$ for a duration $\\tau = 0.275$ s, representing the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, and is zero for the rest of the period.\n\nTo properly set the operating point of subsequent amplification and filtering stages, it is necessary to determine the signal's average value, also known as the DC (Direct Current) component.
