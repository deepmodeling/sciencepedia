{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in understanding digital-to-analog conversion is to analyze the effect of the most common reconstruction method, the Zero-Order Hold (ZOH). The ZOH is not merely a placeholder; it acts as a filter with a distinct frequency response that shapes the output spectrum. This practice invites you to derive a critical feature of this response: the location of its first spectral null, which demonstrates the inherent, though imperfect, low-pass nature of the ZOH and sets the stage for why an additional anti-imaging filter is crucial [@problem_id:1698646].", "problem": "In an idealized model of a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), the process of converting a sequence of discrete-time samples, $x[n]$, into a continuous-time signal, $x(t)$, is often modeled by a zero-order hold (ZOH) circuit. The ZOH takes each sample value $x[n]$ at time $t=nT$ and holds it constant until the next sample arrives at $t=(n+1)T$. Here, $T$ is the sampling period in seconds.\n\nThe behavior of the ZOH can be characterized by its continuous-time impulse response, $h(t)$, which is a rectangular pulse of unit height starting at $t=0$ and with a duration of $T$. The frequency response of the ZOH, denoted by $H(j\\Omega)$, where $\\Omega$ is the continuous-time angular frequency in radians per second, describes how the ZOH affects the frequency components of the reconstructed signal.\n\nA key characteristic of the ZOH is that its frequency response naturally attenuates certain frequencies. In fact, its magnitude response drops to zero at specific non-zero frequencies. This effect is sometimes utilized in the design of anti-imaging filters, which are used to remove unwanted spectral repetitions (images) created by the sampling process.\n\nFor a system employing a zero-order hold with a sampling period of $T$, determine the lowest positive continuous-time angular frequency, $\\Omega$, at which the magnitude of the ZOH's frequency response, $|H(j\\Omega)|$, is exactly zero.
