The signal is non-zero only for $n = 0, 1, \\dots, L-1$, and the sampling frequency is $f_s$. To estimate the signal's power spectral density, the engineer uses the periodogram method.\n\nThe engineer considers two approaches:\n1.  Compute the $L$-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), denoted $X_L[k]$, of the original signal $x[n]$. The periodogram is then calculated.\n2.  Create a new signal, $x_p[n]$, by appending $Z$ zeros to $x[n]$, resulting in a signal of total length $N = L+Z$, where $N > L$. Then, compute the $N$-point DFT, denoted $X_N[k]$, of the zero-padded signal $x_p[n]$. The periodogram is calculated from this result.\n\nThe fundamental frequency resolution of a spectral estimate refers to its ability to distinguish between two distinct, closely spaced frequency components in the original continuous-time signal.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the effect of the zero-padding procedure (i.e., using approach 2 instead of approach 1) on the fundamental frequency resolution of the periodogram?\n\nA. Zero-padding improves the fundamental frequency resolution because the frequency spacing between DFT points, given by $f_s/N$, decreases as the DFT length $N$ increases.\n\nB. Zero-padding does not improve the fundamental frequency resolution. This resolution is determined by the duration of the original non-zero signal segment (length $L$), and zero-padding only provides a more densely sampled, or interpolated, version of the underlying spectral shape.\n\nC. Zero-padding degrades the fundamental frequency resolution because adding zeros to the time-domain signal effectively convolves its spectrum with a sinc-like function, which introduces additional spectral smearing.\n\nD. Zero-padding improves the fundamental frequency resolution, but this improvement is only significant if the total length $N$ is chosen to be a power of two, leveraging the efficiency of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n\nE. Zero-padding has no effect on either the frequency resolution or the visual appearance of the resulting periodogram plot, because the added zeros contain no energy.", "solution": "We begin with a finite-length, discrete-time signal $x[n]$ that is non-zero only for $n=0,1,\\dots,L-1$.
