We will construct this signal starting from the unit impulse sequence, $\\delta[n]$, by applying two fundamental transformations: time shifting and amplitude scaling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the base signal.**\nThe unit impulse sequence, $\\delta[n]$, is a signal that has a value of 1 at time index $n=0$ and is 0 for all other integer values of $n$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply time shifting.**\nThe target signal $y[n]$ must be non-zero at $n=5$, whereas the base signal $\\delta[n]$ is non-zero at $n=0$. We need to shift the impulse from $n=0$ to $n=5$. A time shift of a discrete signal $x[n]$ by $n_0$ samples to the right is represented by the transformation $x[n-n_0]$.\nIn our case, to shift the impulse 5 units to the right, we set $n_0 = 5$. Applying this to the unit impulse gives us a new signal, let's call it $g[n]$:\n$$g[n] = \\delta[n-5]$$\nThis signal $g[n]$ has a value of 1 at $n=5$ (since $n-5=0$ when $n=5$) and is 0 for all other values of $n$. This correctly positions the impulse in time.\n\n**Step 3: Apply amplitude scaling.**\nThe target signal $y[n]$ must have a value of $-2$ at its non-zero point. The signal we have constructed so far, $g[n] = \\delta[n-5]$, has a value of 1 at $n=5$. To change the amplitude from 1 to $-2$, we need to multiply the signal by a scaling factor of $-2$.\nAmplitude scaling of a signal $x[n]$ by a constant $A$ is represented by $A x[n]$.\nApplying this to our time-shifted signal $g[n]$, we get the final signal $y[n]$:\n$$y[n] = -2 \\cdot g[n]$$\n$$y[n] = -2\\delta[n-5]$$\n\n**Step 4: Verify the result.**\nLet's check the properties of the derived signal $y[n] = -2\\delta[n-5]$.\nThe term $\\delta[n-5]$ is non-zero only when its argument is zero, i.e., when $n-5=0$, which means $n=5$.\nAt $n=5$, the value is $y[5] = -2\\delta[5-5] = -2\\delta[0] = -2 \\times 1 = -2$.\nFor any $n \\neq 5$, the argument $n-5 \\neq 0$, so $\\delta[n-5] = 0$.

A common point of confusion is the order in which these operations are applied; this problem requires you to correctly formalize an intuitive description like \"twice as narrow and delayed\" into a precise mathematical expression.

An engineer needs to generate a new signal, $g(t)$, by modifying this base pulse. The specifications require that the new signal $g(t)$ must have the same essential shape as $p(t)$, but with two specific transformations:\n\n1.  The duration of the pulse must be compressed to be exactly half of the original duration of $p(t)$, making it \"twice as narrow\".\n2.  The pulse must be delayed in time, such that its center is located at $t=3$.\n\nExpress the new signal $g(t)$ in terms of the original signal function $p$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to express a transformed signal, $g(t)$, in terms of an original signal, $p(t)$, based on a set of transformations of the independent variable, time $t$. The original signal $p(t)$ is centered at $t=0$. The transformed signal $g(t)$ is centered at $t=3$ and is twice as narrow as $p(t)$.\n\nLet's analyze the transformations one by one.\n\nFirst, consider the time-scaling operation. A signal is compressed in time by a factor of $k$ (where $k > 1$) by replacing the time variable $t$ with $k t$. The problem states that $g(t)$ is \"twice as narrow\" as $p(t)$, which means it is compressed by a factor of 2. Therefore, the scaling factor is $k=2$. This operation is represented by $t \\to 2t$.\n\nSecond, consider the time-shifting operation. A signal is delayed, or shifted to the right on the time axis, by an amount $t_0$ by replacing the time variable $t$ with $t - t_0$. The problem states that the center of the new pulse $g(t)$ is at $t=3$. Since the original pulse $p(t)$ was centered at $t=0$, this represents a delay of $t_0 = 3$. This operation is represented by $t \\to t-3$.\n\nNow, we must combine these two transformations. The order in which the transformations are applied is crucial. A general form for a scaled and shifted signal is $p(\\alpha(t-t_0))$, where $\\alpha$ is the scaling factor and $t_0$ is the time shift of the center.\n\nIn our case:\n- The scaling factor $\\alpha$ corresponds to the compression. Since the pulse is compressed by a factor of 2, we have $\\alpha=2$.\n- The time shift $t_0$ is the location of the new center. Since the pulse is delayed to be centered at $t=3$, we have $t_0=3$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the general form $p(\\alpha(t-t_0))$ gives:\n$$ g(t) = p(2(t-3)) $$\n\nExpanding the argument, we get:\n$$ g(t) = p(2t - 6) $$\n\nLet's verify this result.\nThe center of the pulse occurs where the argument of the function is zero. For the original pulse $p(t)$, the center is at $t=0$. For the transformed pulse $g(t) = p(2t-6)$, the center is located at the time $t$ where the argument $2t-6$ equals zero.\n$$ 2t - 6 = 0 \\implies 2t = 6 \\implies t = 3 $$\nThis matches the specified delay.\n\nNow let's verify the compression. Suppose the original pulse $p(t)$ is non-zero over an interval of width $W$, for example, from $t = -W/2$ to $t = W/2$. The transformed pulse $g(t) = p(2t-6)$ will be non-zero when its argument, $2t-6$, is within this interval:\n$$ -\\frac{W}{2} \\leq 2t-6 \\leq \\frac{W}{2} $$\nAdding 6 to all parts of the inequality gives:\n$$ 6 - \\frac{W}{2} \\leq 2t \\leq 6 + \\frac{W}{2} $$\nDividing by 2 gives:\n$$ 3 - \\frac{W}{4} \\leq t \\leq 3 + \\frac{W}{4} $$\nThe width of this new interval is the difference between the upper and lower bounds:\n$$ \\text{New Width} = \\left(3 + \\frac{W}{4}\\right) - \\left(3 - \\frac{W}{4}\\right) = \\frac{W}{4} + \\frac{W}{4} = \\frac{W}{2} $$\nThe new width is $W/2$, which is half of the original width $W$. This confirms that the pulse is \"twice as narrow\".\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the transformed signal $g(t)$ is $p(2t-6)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p(2t-6)}$$", "id": "1771605"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates our understanding from simply applying transformations to using them as a design tool.
