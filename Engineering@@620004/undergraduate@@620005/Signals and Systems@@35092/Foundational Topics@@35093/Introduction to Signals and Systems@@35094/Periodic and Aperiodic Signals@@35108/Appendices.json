The FSM has four distinct states, denoted `S_0`, `S_1`, `S_2`, and `S_3`. The system is initialized at time `n=0` in state `S_0`.\n\nThe FSM transitions between states in a fixed, cyclical order. It remains in its current state `S_k` for a specific number of clock cycles, `c_k`, before deterministically transitioning to the next state in the sequence. The state dwell times are as follows:\n- The machine remains in `S_0` for `c_0 = 5` clock cycles before transitioning to `S_1`.\n- The machine remains in `S_1` for `c_1 = 7` clock cycles before transitioning to `S_2`.\n- The machine remains in `S_2` for `c_2 = 4` clock cycles before transitioning to `S_3`.\n- The machine remains in `S_3` for `c_3 = 9` clock cycles before transitioning back to `S_0`, thus completing one full operational cycle.\n\nFor any time `n`, the output signal `x[n]` has a value determined by the FSM's current state. The output values associated with each state are `y_0 = 3` for `S_0`, `y_1 = -2` for `S_1`, `y_2 = 1` for `S_2`, and `y_3 = 5` for `S_3`. Since the FSM's operation is cyclical, the resulting signal `x[n]` is periodic.\n\nDetermine the fundamental period, `N`, of the signal `x[n]`.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental period `N` of a discrete-time signal `x[n]` generated by a Finite State Machine (FSM).\n\nA discrete-time signal `x[n]` is periodic if there exists a positive integer `N` such that `x[n+N] = x[n]` for all integers `n`. The fundamental period is the smallest such positive integer `N`.\n\nThe value of the signal `x[n]` is determined by the state of the FSM at time `n`. The FSM cycles through a sequence of four states: `S_0 \\rightarrow S_1 \\rightarrow S_2 \\rightarrow S_3 \\rightarrow S_0`. For the signal `x[n]` to complete one full cycle of its values and repeat, the FSM must complete one full traversal of its state sequence and return to its starting state (`S_0`).\n\nLet's analyze the time spent in each state during one complete operational cycle of the FSM.\n1.  The machine starts in state `S_0` at `n=0`. It remains in this state for `c_0 = 5` clock cycles. This corresponds to the time indices `n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`. During this interval, `x[n] = y_0 = 3`.\n\n2.  At `n=5`, the FSM transitions to state `S_1`. It remains in this state for `c_1 = 7` clock cycles. This corresponds to the time indices from `n=5` to `n = 5 + (7-1) = 11`. During this interval, `x[n] = y_1 = -2`.\n\n3.  At `n=12`, the FSM transitions to state `S_2`. It remains in this state for `c_2 = 4` clock cycles. This corresponds to the time indices from `n=12` to `n = 12 + (4-1) = 15`. During this interval, `x[n] = y_2 = 1`.\n\n4.  At `n=16`, the FSM transitions to state `S_3`. It remains in this state for `c_3 = 9` clock cycles. This corresponds to the time indices from `n=16` to `n = 16 + (9-1) = 24`. During this interval, `x[n] = y_3 = 5`.\n\n5.  At `n=25`, the FSM transitions back to state `S_0`, beginning a new cycle. The state of the FSM at `n=25` is `S_0`, which is the same as the state at `n=0`.\n\nThe total number of time steps required for the FSM to complete one full cycle and return to its initial state is the sum of the dwell times in each state. This total time corresponds to the period of the signal `x[n]`.\n\nLet `N` be the total number of time steps in one cycle.\n$$N = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 + c_3$$\nSubstituting the given values for the dwell times:\n$$N = 5 + 7 + 4 + 9$$\n$$N = 25$$\n\nSo, the signal `x[n]` repeats every 25 time steps, meaning `x[n+25] = x[n]` for all $n \\ge 0$. Thus, `N=25` is a period of the signal.\n\nTo confirm that this is the *fundamental* period, we must ensure that no smaller period exists. The output values for the four states (`y_0=3, y_1=-2, y_2=1, y_3=5`) are all distinct. The sequence of states `(S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3)` does not have any smaller repeating sub-patterns. Therefore, the sequence of output values `x[n]` will only repeat after the FSM has completed its full cycle through all four states. This means the smallest positive integer `N` for which `x[n+N]=x[n]` must be the total duration of this full cycle.\n\nThe sequence of values over one period is:\n`{3, 3, 3, 3, 3, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5}`.\nThis sequence has a length of 25. It is clear by inspection that there is no smaller repeating pattern within this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental period of the signal `x[n]` is `N = 25`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25}$$", "id": "1740856"}]}
