To avoid losing vital information, we must capture snapshots of the signal frequently enough. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem provides the \"golden rule\" for this process, establishing a theoretical minimum sampling rate. This practice challenges you to apply this fundamental theorem to determine the Nyquist rate for a signal composed of multiple frequencies, a foundational skill for designing any data acquisition system [@problem_id:1696325].", "problem": "A biomedical engineer is developing a data acquisition system for a simplified biological signal. The analog signal, denoted as $x(t)$, is modeled as a superposition of three pure sinusoidal waves corresponding to different physiological activities and environmental noise. The frequencies of these components have been identified as 60 Hz (due to power line interference), 180 Hz (a harmonic of the interference), and 375 Hz (the primary biological component of interest).\n\nTo digitize this signal for computer analysis, it must be sampled at a uniform rate. To ensure that the original analog signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its discrete samples without distortion from aliasing, the sampling frequency must meet a minimum requirement. This theoretical minimum sampling rate is known as the Nyquist rate.\n\nWhat is the Nyquist rate for the signal $x(t)$? Express your answer in hertz (Hz).", "solution": "The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that a bandlimited signal with maximum frequency $f_{\\max}$ can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency $f_{s}$ satisfies $f_{s} \\geq 2 f_{\\max}$. The theoretical minimum sampling rate is the Nyquist rate, given by $f_{N} = 2 f_{\\max}$.\n\nThe given signal is a sum of sinusoids at frequencies $60$, $180$, and $375$ hertz. A general sinusoidal component can be expressed as $A \\cos(2 \\pi f t + \\phi)$, so the signal is bandlimited to its highest frequency component. Hence,\n$$\nf_{\\max} = \\max\\{60, 180, 375\\} = 375.\n$$\nTherefore, the Nyquist rate is\n$$\nf_{N} = 2 f_{\\max} = 2 \\times 375 = 750.\n$$\nSince the unit specified is hertz, the numerical value is $750$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{750}$$", "id": "1696325"}, {"introduction": "After sampling an analog signal in time, we must assign a discrete numerical value to each sampleâ€”a process called quantization. Because we use a finite number of bits to represent an infinite range of possible analog values, there is always a small discrepancy between the original voltage and its digital representation. This exercise explores how to calculate the maximum magnitude of this quantization error, a key metric that defines the precision or fidelity of an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) [@problem_id:1696380].", "problem": "A research team is designing a data acquisition system for a cryogenic physics experiment. A sensor measures a physical property, and a signal conditioning circuit produces a corresponding analog voltage, $V_{in}$, that can range anywhere from $V_{min} = -0.5$ V to $V_{max} = +1.5$ V. This continuous voltage signal must be converted into a digital format for computer analysis.\n\nThe conversion is performed by a specialized component called an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). This particular ADC is a uniform $N$-bit converter, with $N=12$. It maps the entire input voltage range $[V_{min}, V_{max}]$ to a set of $2^N$ discrete, evenly spaced digital output levels. Due to this mapping from a continuous range to a finite set of levels, any analog input voltage is approximated by the nearest available digital level, introducing a small discrepancy.\n\nCalculate the maximum possible magnitude of this discrepancy between the original analog voltage $V_{in}$ and its corresponding digitized representation.
