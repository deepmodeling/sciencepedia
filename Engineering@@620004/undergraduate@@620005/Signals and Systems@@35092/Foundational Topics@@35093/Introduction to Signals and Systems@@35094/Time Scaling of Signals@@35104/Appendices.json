When combining operations like time scaling, reversal, and shifting, as in the general form $y(t) = x(at+b)$, the order of operations is critical.

It is defined as $x(t) = u(t-2) - u(t-6)$. This means that $x(t)$ is non-zero and equal to 1 only when the argument of the function is within the interval $[2, 6]$. That is, $x(\\tau)=1$ if $2 \\le \\tau \\le 6$, and $x(\\tau)=0$ otherwise.\n\nThe new signal is given by $y(t) = x(-2t + 8)$. The value of $y(t)$ will be 1 when the argument of $x$, which is $(-2t+8)$, falls into the interval where $x$ is 1. Therefore, to find the interval of $t$ for which $y(t)=1$, we must solve the following inequality:\n$$\n2 \\le -2t + 8 \\le 6\n$$\n\nWe solve this inequality for $t$ step-by-step.\nFirst, subtract 8 from all three parts of the inequality:\n$$\n2 - 8 \\le (-2t + 8) - 8 \\le 6 - 8\n$$\n$$\n-6 \\le -2t \\le -2\n$$\n\nNext, we need to isolate $t$. We do this by dividing all three parts of the inequality by -2. A crucial rule in handling inequalities is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the direction of the inequality signs must be reversed.\n$$\n\\frac{-6}{-2} \\ge \\frac{-2t}{-2} \\ge \\frac{-2}{-2}\n$$\n$$\n3 \\ge t \\ge 1\n$$\n\nIt is conventional to write the interval with the smaller number on the left. So, we rewrite this as:\n$$\n1 \\le t \\le 3\n$$\n\nThis result means that the new signal $y(t)$ is a rectangular pulse that has a value of 1 for $t$ in the interval $[1, 3]$, and is 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, we need to express this new rectangular pulse using unit step functions. A general rectangular pulse that is 1 on the interval $[a, b]$ can be written as $u(t-a) - u(t-b)$.\nIn our case, the pulse starts at $a=1$ and ends at $b=3$. Therefore, the expression for $y(t)$ is:\n$$\ny(t) = u(t-1) - u(t-3)\n$$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nAlternatively, we can analyze the transformation as a sequence of operations. The expression $y(t) = x(-2t+8)$ can be rewritten as $y(t) = x(-2(t-4))$. This form shows the operations in a specific order:\n1.  **Time Scaling**: Start with $x(t)$, which is a pulse on the interval $[2, 6]$. We form $x(2t)$. This compresses the signal by a factor of 2, so the new pulse is on the interval $[2/2, 6/2] = [1, 3]$.\n2.  **Time Reversal**: Now form $x(-2t)$. This reflects the signal $x(2t)$ about the vertical axis ($t=0$). The interval $[1, 3]$ is reflected to $[-3, -1]$.\n3.  **Time Shifting**: Now form $x(-2(t-4))$. This shifts the signal $x(-2t)$ to the right by 4 units. The interval $[-3, -1]$ is shifted to $[-3+4, -1+4] = [1, 3]$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the transformed signal is a pulse on the interval $[1, 3]$, which is described by $u(t-1) - u(t-3)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1769274"}, {"introduction": "In many practical scenarios, such as communications or radar, we don't apply a transformation; rather, we observe one and must deduce its parameters.
