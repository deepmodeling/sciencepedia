Consider a discrete-time system defined by the input-output relationship\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x[k]$$\nwhere $x[n]$ is the input signal and $y[n]$ is the output signal at any integer time index $n$. This system computes the running sum of the input signal from the distant past up to the current time.\n\nTo characterize this system, we analyze it based on the following standard properties:\n1.  **Memoryless**: The output $y[n]$ at any time $n$ depends only on the input $x[n]$ at the same time $n$.\n2.  **Causal**: The output $y[n]$ at any time $n$ depends only on the present and past values of the input ($x[k]$ for $k \\le n$).\n3.  **Linear**: The system obeys the superposition principle. If an input $x_1[n]$ produces an output $y_1[n]$, and an input $x_2[n]$ produces an output $y_2[n]$, then for any arbitrary constants $a$ and $b$, the input $a x_1[n] + b x_2[n]$ produces the output $a y_1[n] + b y_2[n]$.\n4.  **Time-Invariant**: A time shift in the input signal results in an identical time shift in the output signal. If an input $x[n]$ produces an output $y[n]$, then the input $x[n-n_0]$ must produce the output $y[n-n_0]$ for any integer shift $n_0$.\n5.  **Bounded-Input, Bounded-Output (BIBO) Stable**: For any bounded input signal (i.e., there exists a finite number $M_x$ such that $|x[n]| \\le M_x < \\infty$ for all $n$), the resulting output signal is also bounded (i.e., there exists a finite number $M_y$ such that $|y[n]| \\le M_y < \\infty$ for all $n$).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the accumulator system?\n\nA.

Stable, Causal, Linear", "solution": "To determine the correct set of properties for the system $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x[k]$, we will test each property individually.\n\n**1. Memory:**\nA system is memoryless if its output $y[n]$ depends only on the input $x[n]$ at the same instant in time. The given system's output is $y[n] = x[n] + x[n-1] + x[n-2] + \\dots$. The output at time $n$ clearly depends on past values of the input in addition to the present value. For example, $y[n]$ depends on $x[n-1]$. Therefore, the system is not memoryless; it has memory. This eliminates option A.\n\n**2. Causality:**\nA system is causal if its output $y[n]$ does not depend on future values of the input. The defining equation is $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x[k]$. The summation index $k$ ranges from $-\\infty$ up to the current time $n$. This means that to compute $y[n]$, we only need input values $x[k]$ for $k \\le n$. No input values for $k>n$ (i.e., future values) are required. Therefore, the system is causal.\n\n**3. Linearity:**\nTo test for linearity, we check if the system satisfies the superposition principle. Let $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$ be two arbitrary inputs, and let $a$ and $b$ be two arbitrary constants.\nThe corresponding outputs are:\n$y_1[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x_1[k]$\n$y_2[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x_2[k]$\n\nNow, consider a new input $x_3[n] = a x_1[n] + b x_2[n]$. The output $y_3[n]$ is:\n$$y_3[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x_3[k] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} (a x_1[k] + b x_2[k])$$\nUsing the distributive property of summation:\n$$y_3[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} a x_1[k] + \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} b x_2[k]$$\n$$y_3[n] = a \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x_1[k] + b \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x_2[k]$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $y_1[n]$ and $y_2[n]$:\n$$y_3[n] = a y_1[n] + b y_2[n]$$\nSince the output for a linear combination of inputs is the same linear combination of the individual outputs, the system is linear. This eliminates option C which states the system is non-linear.\n\n**4. Time-Invariance:**\nTo test for time-invariance, we compare the output due to a shifted input with a shifted version of the original output.\nLet the output corresponding to an input $x[n]$ be $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x[k]$.\nNow, consider a shifted input $x_s[n] = x[n-n_0]$ for some integer shift $n_0$. The output $y_s[n]$ is:\n$$y_s[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x_s[k] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x[k-n_0]$$\nLet's perform a change of variables in the summation. Let $m = k - n_0$, which means $k = m + n_0$. The summation limits change accordingly: as $k \\to -\\infty$, $m \\to -\\infty$; when $k=n$, $m=n-n_0$. So the sum becomes:\n$$y_s[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{n-n_0} x[m]$$\nNow, let's find the shifted version of the original output, $y[n-n_0]$. We replace $n$ with $n-n_0$ in the original system equation:\n$$y[n-n_0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n-n_0} x[k]$$\nBy comparing the two results, we see that $y_s[n] = y[n-n_0]$. The dummy variable of summation ($m$ or $k$) does not change the result. Thus, the system is time-invariant. This eliminates option D which states the system is time-varying.\n\n**5. BIBO Stability:**\nTo test for BIBO stability, we must determine if every bounded input produces a bounded output. We can test this with a counterexample.\nConsider the bounded input $x[n] = u[n]$, the unit step function. This input is bounded because $|x[n]| \\le 1$ for all $n$.\nThe corresponding output $y[n]$ is:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} u[k]$$\nSince $u[k] = 0$ for $k  0$ and $u[k] = 1$ for $k \\ge 0$, the sum becomes:\nFor $n  0$, $y[n] = 0$.\nFor $n \\ge 0$, $y[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} 1 = n+1$.\nSo, the output can be written as $y[n] = (n+1)u[n]$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the output $y[n] = n+1 \\to \\infty$.\nSince we have found a bounded input, $u[n]$, that produces an unbounded output, the system is not BIBO stable. This eliminates option E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe system is Causal, Linear, and Time-Invariant.
