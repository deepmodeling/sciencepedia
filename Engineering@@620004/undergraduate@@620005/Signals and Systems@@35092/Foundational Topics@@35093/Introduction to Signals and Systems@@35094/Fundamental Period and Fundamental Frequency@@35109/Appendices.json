The signal is not periodic.", "solution": "The given discrete-time signal is $x[n] = 5 + \\cos(0.25\\pi n)$.\nThis signal can be viewed as the sum of two separate signals: a constant DC component, $x_1[n] = 5$, and a sinusoidal AC component, $x_2[n] = \\cos(0.25\\pi n)$.\nA signal is periodic if it repeats itself after some integer period $N > 0$, i.e., $x[n] = x[n+N]$ for all integers $n$. The smallest such positive integer $N$ is called the fundamental period.\nIf a signal is a sum of two or more periodic signals, its fundamental period is the least common multiple (LCM) of the fundamental periods of its individual components.\n\nFirst, let's find the fundamental period of the DC component, $x_1[n] = 5$.\nA constant signal is periodic for any integer period. For any integer $N_1 \\geq 1$, we have $x_1[n] = 5$ and $x_1[n+N_1] = 5$, so $x_1[n] = x_1[n+N_1]$. The smallest positive integer for which this holds is $N_1 = 1$. Thus, the fundamental period of the DC component is $N_1 = 1$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the sinusoidal component, $x_2[n] = \\cos(0.25\\pi n)$.\nA general discrete-time sinusoidal signal of the form $\\cos(\\omega_0 n)$ is periodic if and only if its angular frequency $\\omega_0$ is a rational multiple of $2\\pi$. This can be expressed as the condition that the ratio $\\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\pi}$ must be a rational number, i.e., $\\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\pi} = \\frac{k}{N}$ for some integers $k$ and $N$.\n\nFor our signal $x_2[n]$, the angular frequency is $\\omega_0 = 0.25\\pi$. Let's check the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\pi} = \\frac{0.25\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{0.25}{2} = \\frac{1/4}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\nSince this ratio is a rational number, the signal $x_2[n]$ is periodic. The fundamental period $N_2$ is the denominator of this fraction when it is expressed in lowest terms. In this case, the fraction is already in lowest terms, so the fundamental period is $N_2 = 8$.\nAlternatively, we are looking for the smallest integer $N_2 > 0$ such that $x_2[n] = x_2[n+N_2]$. This requires $\\cos(0.25\\pi n) = \\cos(0.25\\pi (n+N_2))$. This equality holds if $0.25\\pi N_2$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.\n$$ 0.25\\pi N_2 = 2\\pi k $$\nwhere $k$ is an integer. Solving for $N_2$:\n$$ N_2 = \\frac{2\\pi k}{0.25\\pi} = \\frac{2k}{0.25} = 8k $$\nThe fundamental period is the smallest positive integer value of $N_2$, which occurs for the smallest positive integer $k=1$. Thus, $N_2 = 8$.\n\nFinally, the fundamental period of the total signal $x[n] = x_1[n] + x_2[n]$ is the least common multiple of the individual fundamental periods $N_1$ and $N_2$.\n$$ N = \\text{lcm}(N_1, N_2) = \\text{lcm}(1, 8) $$\nThe least common multiple of 1 and 8 is 8.\nTherefore, the fundamental period of the signal $x[n]$ is 8. This shows that the DC offset does not alter the fundamental period of the periodic component of the signal.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. 4 is incorrect. This might arise from incorrectly calculating the period as $1/0.25$.\nB. 5 is incorrect. This corresponds to the DC offset value, which does not define the period.\nC. 8 is the correct answer.\nD. 13 is incorrect. This might be a result of erroneously adding the DC offset to the period.\nE. \"The signal is not periodic\" is incorrect, as we have shown that $\\omega_0 / (2\\pi)$ is a rational number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1722014"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic principles, this exercise explores how to determine the periodicity of a signal formed by the superposition of multiple periodic components.
