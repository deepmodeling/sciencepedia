Conversely, a sequence $y[n]$ is defined as **left-sided** if there exists a finite integer $N_2$ such that $y[n] = 0$ for all integers $n > N_2$.

The product $z[n]$ is a finite-duration sequence only if the intervals where $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ can be non-zero have a non-empty intersection.\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the properties of a sequence $z[n]$ which is the pointwise product of a right-sided sequence $x[n]$ and a left-sided sequence $y[n]$. Let's analyze the properties of $z[n]$ based on the given definitions.\n\nFirst, let's restate the definitions provided in the problem:\n- $x[n]$ is right-sided: There exists an integer $N_1$ such that $x[n] = 0$ for all $n < N_1$. This means $x[n]$ can only be non-zero for $n \\ge N_1$.\n- $y[n]$ is left-sided: There exists an integer $N_2$ such that $y[n] = 0$ for all $n > N_2$. This means $y[n]$ can only be non-zero for $n \\le N_2$.\n- $z[n]$ is finite-duration: There exist integers $M_1$ and $M_2$ such that $z[n] = 0$ for all $n < M_1$ and $n > M_2$. This is equivalent to saying that a finite-duration sequence is both right-sided and left-sided.\n\nThe product sequence is $z[n] = x[n] y[n]$.\n\nLet's check if $z[n]$ is right-sided.\nAccording to the definition of a right-sided sequence, $x[n] = 0$ for all $n < N_1$. For any such $n$, the product is $z[n] = x[n] y[n] = 0 \\cdot y[n] = 0$. This holds for all $n < N_1$. Therefore, we have found an integer (namely $N_1$) such that $z[n] = 0$ for all $n$ less than it. By definition, $z[n]$ is a right-sided sequence.\n\nNow, let's check if $z[n]$ is left-sided.\nAccording to the definition of a left-sided sequence, $y[n] = 0$ for all $n > N_2$. For any such $n$, the product is $z[n] = x[n] y[n] = x[n] \\cdot 0 = 0$. This holds for all $n > N_2$. Therefore, we have found an integer (namely $N_2$) such that $z[n] = 0$ for all $n$ greater than it. By definition, $z[n]$ is a left-sided sequence.\n\nA sequence that is both right-sided and left-sided is a finite-duration sequence. Since we have shown that $z[n]$ is always right-sided and always left-sided, it must always be a finite-duration sequence. The non-zero values of $z[n]$ are confined to the interval $N_1 \\le n \\le N_2$.\n\nIt is important to consider the case where $N_1 > N_2$. In this scenario, the region where $x[n]$ can be non-zero ($n \\ge N_1$) and the region where $y[n]$ can be non-zero ($n \\le N_2$) do not overlap. For any integer $n$, either $n < N_1$ (which implies $x[n] = 0$) or $n \\ge N_1 > N_2$ (which implies $y[n] = 0$). In either case, the product $x[n]y[n]$ is zero. Thus, if $N_1 > N_2$, then $z[n] = 0$ for all $n$. The all-zero sequence is a valid finite-duration sequence (for example, by choosing $M_1=1$ and $M_2=0$).\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options with this understanding:\nA. \"The product $z[n]$ is always a right-sided sequence, but it might not be a left-sided sequence.\" This is false. We proved that $z[n]$ is always left-sided as well.\nB. \"The product $z[n]$ is always a left-sided sequence, but it might not be a right-sided sequence.\" This is false. We proved that $z[n]$ is always right-sided as well.\nC. \"The product $z[n]$ is a finite-duration sequence if and only if both $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ are themselves finite-duration sequences.\" This is false. The \"only if\" part is incorrect. Consider the unit step sequence $x[n]=u[n]$, which is right-sided but not finite-duration, and $y[n]=u[-n]$, which is left-sided but not finite-duration. Their product is $z[n] = u[n]u[-n] = \\delta[n]$ (the unit impulse), which is non-zero only at $n=0$ and is therefore a finite-duration sequence. Thus, we have a finite-duration product from two non-finite-duration sequences.\nD. \"The product $z[n]$ of any right-sided sequence $x[n]$ and any left-sided sequence $y[n]$ is always a finite-duration sequence.\" This is true, as demonstrated by our analysis above. The product sequence is always both right-sided and left-sided, which is the definition of a finite-duration sequence.\nE. \"The product $z[n]$ is a finite-duration sequence only if the intervals where $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ can be non-zero have a non-empty intersection.\" This is false. As discussed, if the intervals do not overlap (e.g., $N_1 > N_2$), the product sequence $z[n]$ is the all-zero sequence. The all-zero sequence is a finite-duration sequence. Therefore, a finite-duration sequence can result even if the non-zero intervals do not intersect.
