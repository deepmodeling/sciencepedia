This exercise guides you to discover the highest possible frequency of a discrete-time sinusoid, a concept that underpins many phenomena in digital signal processing [@problem_id:1738158]. Understanding this \"speed limit,\" represented by the normalized angular frequency $\\omega = \\pi$, is crucial for correctly interpreting discrete-time signals.", "problem": "An engineering student is experimenting with a software-based synthesizer to generate discrete-time signals. The fundamental signal is a cosine wave of the form $x[n] = \\cos(\\omega n)$, where $n$ is the integer sample index and $\\omega$ is the normalized angular frequency. The student observes that as they increase the value of $\\omega$ starting from 0, the resulting signal $x[n]$ appears to oscillate more and more rapidly. For instance, the signal for $\\omega = \\pi/2$ oscillates faster than the signal for $\\omega = \\pi/4$.\n\nCuriously, this trend does not continue indefinitely. The student finds that there exists a specific frequency at which the signal achieves its maximum possible rate of oscillation. If $\\omega$ is increased beyond this special value, the perceived rate of oscillation actually begins to decrease.
