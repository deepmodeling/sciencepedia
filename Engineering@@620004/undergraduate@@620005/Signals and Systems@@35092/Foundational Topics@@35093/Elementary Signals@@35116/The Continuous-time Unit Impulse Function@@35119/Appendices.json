The expression to evaluate is:\n$$ I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (t^2 + 1) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}t\\right) \\delta(2t - 6) dt $$\nThe key to solving this integral is to correctly apply the properties of the Dirac delta function, $\\delta(t)$. We have a scaled and shifted delta function in the integrand, $\\delta(2t - 6)$.\n\nFirst, we apply the scaling property of the Dirac delta function, which states that for any non-zero constant $a$:\n$$ \\delta(at - t_0) = \\frac{1}{|a|} \\delta\\left(t - \\frac{t_0}{a}\\right) $$\nIn our case, the argument of the delta function is $2t - 6$. We can identify $a=2$ and $t_0=6$. Applying the scaling property gives:\n$$ \\delta(2t - 6) = \\delta(2(t - 3)) = \\frac{1}{|2|} \\delta(t-3) = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta(t-3) $$\nNow, we substitute this simplified form of the delta function back into the original integral:\n$$ I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (t^2 + 1) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}t\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\delta(t-3)\\right) dt $$\nThe constant factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (t^2 + 1) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}t\\right) \\delta(t-3) dt $$\nNext, we use the sifting property of the Dirac delta function. This property states that for a function $f(t)$ that is continuous at $t=t_0$:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) \\delta(t-t_0) dt = f(t_0) $$\nIn our integral, the function $f(t)$ is $(t^2 + 1) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}t\\right)$ and the delta function is centered at $t_0 = 3$.
