The additivity property states that if an input $x_1(t)$ produces an output $y_1(t)$ and an input $x_2(t)$ produces an output $y_2(t)$, then an input $x_1(t) + x_2(t)$ must produce the output $y_1(t) + y_2(t)$. Let's denote the system's operation as $T[\\cdot]$, so $y(t) = T[x(t)]$. The test is to check if $T[x_1(t) + x_2(t)] = T[x_1(t)] + T[x_2(t)]$ for arbitrary inputs $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$.\n\n**System A: $y(t) = (t^2+1)x(t)$**\nLet $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be two arbitrary inputs.\nThe corresponding outputs are:\n$y_1(t) = (t^2+1)x_1(t)$\n$y_2(t) = (t^2+1)x_2(t)$\nThe sum of these individual outputs is:\n$y_1(t) + y_2(t) = (t^2+1)x_1(t) + (t^2+1)x_2(t) = (t^2+1)(x_1(t) + x_2(t))$\nNow, let's consider the input $x_3(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)$.
