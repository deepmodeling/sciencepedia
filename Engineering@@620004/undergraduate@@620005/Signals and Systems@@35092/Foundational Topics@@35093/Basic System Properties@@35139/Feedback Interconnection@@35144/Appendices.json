This process is incorporated into a control system using a proportional controller with a real, positive gain $K$, arranged in a unity negative feedback configuration.\n\nThe performance of such a system is often characterized by its transient response to a step input. A crucial metric is the 2% settling time, $T_s$, defined as the time it takes for the system's response to a unit step input to reach and stay within 2% of its final steady-state value. For any stable first-order system whose transfer function has a single pole at $s = -p$ (where $p > 0$), the 2% settling time can be accurately approximated by the formula $T_s = \\frac{4}{p}$.\n\nDetermine the specific numerical value of the proportional gain $K$ that will cause the 2% settling time of the closed-loop system to be exactly one-fifth of the 2% settling time of the original, open-loop process $G(s)$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the proportional gain $K$ such that the 2% settling time of the closed-loop system, $T_{s,cl}$, is one-fifth of the 2% settling time of the open-loop plant, $T_{s,ol}$.

The transfer function is given as:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{5}{s+1}$$\nThis is a first-order system of the form $\\frac{A}{s+p}$. By comparing the two, we can identify the pole location. The pole of $G(s)$ is at $s = -1$.\nAccording to the problem definition, the parameter $p$ for the open-loop system is $p_{ol} = 1$.\nUsing the provided formula for the 2% settling time, $T_s = \\frac{4}{p}$, we can calculate the settling time of the open-loop plant:\n$$T_{s,ol} = \\frac{4}{p_{ol}} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$$\n\nNext, we need to find the transfer function of the closed-loop system, which we will denote as $H(s)$.
