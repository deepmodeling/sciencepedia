In the hypothetical scenario presented in this problem [@problem_id:1756714], the system's output depends on whether the input signal has *ever* crossed a certain threshold in its entire past, requiring it to track the input's historical maximum. Analyzing this 'fail-safe' mechanism will challenge you to see memory as a form of stored state, a concept crucial for understanding everything from digital logic to complex adaptive systems.", "problem": "Consider a continuous-time system designed as a \"fail-safe\" signal limiter. The system's input is $x(t)$ and its output is $y(t)$. There is a predefined positive, finite safety threshold $L$. The system's behavior is as follows:\n- At any time $t$, if the magnitude of the input signal $|x(\\tau)|$ has *never* exceeded the threshold $L$ for any $\\tau \\le t$, the system operates in a \"pass-through\" mode, where $y(t) = x(t)$.\n- If, at some time $t_f \\le t$, the input magnitude $|x(t_f)|$ first exceeds the threshold $L$, the system permanently latches into a \"fail-safe\" mode.

The system has memory because the value of $M(t)$ depends on the entire history of the input $x(\\tau)$ for $\\tau \\le t$, not just on the value $x(t)$.\n\nD. The system is memoryless because it is a causal system, and all causal systems are memoryless.\n\nE. The system has memory because its output can depend on future values of the input signal, $x(\\tau)$ for $\\tau  t$.", "solution": "To determine if the system has memory, we must analyze whether the output $y(t_0)$ at an arbitrary time $t_0$ depends solely on the input $x(t_0)$ at that same time. If the output depends on the input at times other than $t_0$ (i.e., $x(\\tau)$ for $\\tau \\neq t_0$), the system has memory.\n\nA formal test for a memoryless system is to consider two different input signals, $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$. If we can find a time $t_0$ such that $x_1(t_0) = x_2(t_0)$ but the corresponding outputs are different, $y_1(t_0) \\neq y_2(t_0)$, then the system cannot be memoryless. The difference in output must be due to the signals being different at times other than $t_0$, which proves the system has memory.\n\nLet's construct such a counterexample for the given system. Let the safety threshold be $L=2$. We will choose a time $t_0 = 5$ for our analysis.\n\nConsider a first input signal $x_1(t)$ defined as:\n$x_1(t) = 1$ for all $t$.\nFor this signal, the supremum of its magnitude up to any time $t$ is $M_1(t) = \\sup_{\\tau \\le t} |x_1(\\tau)| = \\sup_{\\tau \\le t} |1| = 1$.\nSince $M_1(t) = 1 \\le L = 2$ for all $t$, the system's output is determined by the first case of the rule: $y_1(t) = x_1(t)$.\nAt our chosen time $t_0=5$, the input is $x_1(5) = 1$ and the output is $y_1(5) = x_1(5) = 1$.\n\nNow, consider a second input signal $x_2(t)$ defined as:\n$$\nx_2(t) = \\begin{cases} \n3  \\text{if } 0 \\le t \\le 1 \\\\\n1  \\text{if } t  1 \\\\\n0  \\text{if } t  0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt our chosen time $t_0 = 5$, the input value is $x_2(5) = 1$. Notice that $x_1(5) = x_2(5) = 1$.\n\nLet's calculate the corresponding output $y_2(5)$. To do this, we must first find $M_2(5) = \\sup_{\\tau \\le 5} |x_2(\\tau)|$.\nThe signal $x_2(t)$ has a value of 3 in the interval $0 \\le t \\le 1$. Therefore, the supremum of its magnitude over $(-\\infty, 5]$ is 3. So, $M_2(5) = 3$.\nNow we compare this to the threshold $L=2$. Since $M_2(5) = 3  L = 2$, the system's output is determined by the second case of the rule: $y_2(t) = 0$ for all $t$ where $M_2(t)L$. This condition is met for all $t \\ge 1$.\nAt our chosen time $t_0=5$, the output is $y_2(5) = 0$.\n\nWe have now demonstrated a case where two inputs are identical at a specific time, $x_1(5) = x_2(5) = 1$, but their corresponding outputs are different, $y_1(5) = 1$ and $y_2(5) = 0$. The reason for this difference is that $y_2(5)$ depends on the fact that the input $x_2(t)$ exceeded the threshold in the past (at $t \\in [0, 1]$). Therefore, the output at $t=5$ depends on past values of the input, and the system has memory.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. While the condition is checked at time $t$, the quantity being checked, $M(t)$, is a functional of the entire past history of the input signal. The output is not determined by the value of $x(t)$ alone.\nB. This is incorrect. A system property like memory is an intrinsic characteristic of the input-output relationship, independent of any specific input that might be applied to it. The analysis above shows the system has memory by its very definition.\nC. This is the correct statement. The output $y(t)$ is explicitly dependent on $M(t) = \\sup_{\\tau \\le t} |x(\\tau)|$. This quantity, by its definition, requires knowledge of the input signal over the entire interval $(-\\infty, t]$. Since the output depends on input values other than $x(t)$, the system has memory.\nD. This is incorrect. Causality and memory are distinct properties. A system is causal if its output at time $t$ does not depend on future inputs ($x(\\tau)$ for $\\tau  t$). This system is causal, as the calculation of $y(t)$ only requires inputs up to time $t$. However, as proven, it has memory. An ideal capacitor is another example of a causal system with memory.\nE. This is incorrect. The system is causal. The definition of $M(t)$ only involves the supremum over past and present times ($\\tau \\le t$). The output $y(t)$ never depends on $x(\\tau)$ for $\\tau  t$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate analysis is provided by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1756714"}]}
