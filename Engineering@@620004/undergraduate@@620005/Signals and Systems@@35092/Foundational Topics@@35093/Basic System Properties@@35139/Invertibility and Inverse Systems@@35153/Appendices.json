By working through this problem, you will learn how to formally prove that a system is non-invertible by finding a specific counterexample—two different inputs that lead to the exact same output—thus solidifying your understanding of this key system property [@problem_id:1731893].", "problem": "A discrete-time system, denoted as System $S$, is defined by the input-output relationship $y[n] = x[2n]$, where $x[n]$ is the input signal and $y[n]$ is the output signal.

In other words, if an input $x_1[n]$ is different from an input $x_2[n]$, then their corresponding outputs, $y_1[n]$ and $y_2[n]$, must also be different. If a system is invertible, an inverse system exists that can uniquely recover the original input signal from the output signal.\n\nBased on this definition, which of the following statements about System $S$ is correct?\n\nA. The system is not invertible because different input signals can lead to the same output signal. For example, the input signal $x_1[n] = \\delta[n]$ and the input signal $x_2[n] = \\delta[n] + \\delta[n-1]$ both produce the same output signal.

A system is not invertible if we can find at least one pair of distinct inputs, $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$ (where $x_1[n] \\neq x_2[n]$), that produce the exact same output, $y_1[n] = y_2[n]$.\n\nThe operation $y[n] = x[2n]$ takes the input signal $x[n]$ and keeps only the samples at even indices ($n=0, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\dots$). The samples of $x[n]$ at odd indices ($n=\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\dots$) are discarded and have no effect on the output $y[n]$. This loss of information suggests that the system may not be invertible.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis by constructing a counterexample, as suggested in option A.\n\nConsider two different input signals, $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$.\nLet the first input signal be the unit impulse:\n$x_1[n] = \\delta[n]$\nThis signal is 1 at $n=0$ and 0 for all other integer values of $n$.\n\nLet's compute the corresponding output $y_1[n]$ using the system equation $y[n] = x[2n]$:\n$y_1[n] = x_1[2n] = \\delta[2n]$\nThe discrete-time impulse $\\delta[k]$ is non-zero only when its argument $k$ is zero. So, $\\delta[2n]$ is non-zero only when $2n=0$, which implies $n=0$.\nThus, the output signal is $y_1[n] = \\delta[n]$.\n\nNow, let's consider a second, different input signal. Let's choose the one from option A:\n$x_2[n] = \\delta[n] + \\delta[n-1]$\nThis signal is 1 at $n=0$, 1 at $n=1$, and 0 for all other integer values of $n$.\nClearly, $x_1[n] \\neq x_2[n]$ because $x_2[1]=1$ while $x_1[1]=0$.\n\nLet's compute the corresponding output $y_2[n]$:\n$y_2[n] = x_2[2n] = (\\delta[n] + \\delta[n-1])|_{n \\to 2n} = \\delta[2n] + \\delta[2n-1]$\nWe analyze each term:\n1. The term $\\delta[2n]$ is 1 when $2n=0$ (i.e., $n=0$) and 0 otherwise. So, $\\delta[2n]=\\delta[n]$.\n2. The term $\\delta[2n-1]$ is 1 when $2n-1=0$, which would mean $n=1/2$. Since $n$ must be an integer for discrete-time signals, the condition $2n-1=0$ is never met. Therefore, $\\delta[2n-1] = 0$ for all integers $n$.\n\nCombining these results, the output is:\n$y_2[n] = \\delta[n] + 0 = \\delta[n]$.\n\nWe have found two distinct input signals, $x_1[n] = \\delta[n]$ and $x_2[n] = \\delta[n] + \\delta[n-1]$, which both produce the identical output signal $y[n] = \\delta[n]$. By the definition of invertibility, since distinct inputs do not guarantee distinct outputs, the system is not invertible. This confirms that the reasoning in option A is correct.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n- Option B suggests a potential inverse. While this \"upsampling\" system can be applied to any output $y[n]$, it does not guarantee recovery of the original signal. As shown with our counterexample, if the true input was $x_2[n] = \\delta[n] + \\delta[n-1]$, the output is $y[n]=\\delta[n]$. Applying the proposed inverse gives $z[n] = \\delta[n]$, not the original $x_2[n]$. Therefore, it is not a valid inverse for all possible inputs.\n- Option C is mathematically ill-defined for a discrete-time system, as $y[n/2]$ is not defined when $n$ is an odd integer.\n- Option D makes a false claim. A system being time-varying does not automatically make it non-invertible. For example, $y(t) = t \\cdot x(t)$ is time-varying but is invertible (for $t \\neq 0$) with the inverse $x(t) = (1/t) \\cdot y(t)$. Invertibility and time-invariance are independent properties.\n- Option E misinterprets the definition of invertibility. It misses the critical requirement of uniqueness. For a system to be invertible, there must be a one-to-one mapping between inputs and outputs. The fact that we can find *an* input for a given output is not sufficient; we must be able to find a *unique* input.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1731893"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how information loss leads to non-invertibility, we now explore the opposite case: constructing an inverse to recover an original signal.
