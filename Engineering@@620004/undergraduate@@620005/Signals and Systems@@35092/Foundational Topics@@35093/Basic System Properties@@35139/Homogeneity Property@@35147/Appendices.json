The system is homogeneous, but only for real-valued input signals $x[n]$.", "solution": "To determine if the system is homogeneous, we must test if it satisfies the scaling property. A system, represented by the operator $\\mathcal{T}$, is homogeneous if for any input signal $x[n]$ and any arbitrary complex constant $a$, the following condition holds:\n\n$\\mathcal{T}\\{ax[n]\\} = a \\mathcal{T}\\{x[n]\\}$\n\nLet's analyze the given system, $y[n] = \\mathcal{T}\\{x[n]\\} = x[n]x[n-1]$.\n\nFirst, let's find the response of the system to a scaled input. Let the new input be $x_1[n] = a x[n]$. The corresponding output, which we'll call $y_1[n]$, is given by:\n\n$y_1[n] = \\mathcal{T}\\{x_1[n]\\} = \\mathcal{T}\\{a x[n]\\}$\n\nTo compute this, we substitute $x_1[n]$ into the system equation. The system equation uses both the current input sample, $x_1[n]$, and the previous input sample, $x_1[n-1]$.\n\n$x_1[n] = a x[n]$\n$x_1[n-1] = a x[n-1]$\n\nSubstituting these into the system definition:\n\n$y_1[n] = x_1[n] x_1[n-1] = (a x[n])(a x[n-1])$\n$y_1[n] = a^2 x[n]x[n-1]$\n\nNow, let's compute the right-hand side of the homogeneity condition, $a \\mathcal{T}\\{x[n]\\}$. We know the original output is $y[n] = \\mathcal{T}\\{x[n]\\} = x[n]x[n-1]$. So, we scale this output by $a$:\n\n$a \\mathcal{T}\\{x[n]\\} = a y[n] = a (x[n]x[n-1])$\n\nFinally, we compare the two results. For the system to be homogeneous, we must have $y_1[n] = a y[n]$.\n\nIs $a^2 x[n]x[n-1] = a x[n]x[n-1]$?\n\nFor a general, non-zero input signal $x[n]$, this equality only holds if $a^2 = a$. The equation $a^2 - a = 0$, or $a(a-1) = 0$, is only true for the specific values $a=0$ and $a=1$. The homogeneity property requires this condition to hold for *any* arbitrary constant $a$. Since it fails for any $a$ other than 0 or 1 (for example, if $a=2$, the output is scaled by $2^2=4$, not by 2), the system is not homogeneous.\n\nThe reason for this failure is that scaling the input by $a$ results in the output being scaled by $a^2$. This matches the reasoning provided in option B.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n- A is incorrect because the system is not homogeneous.\n- C is incorrect for two reasons. First, the system is not memoryless because the output $y[n]$ depends on a past input $x[n-1]$. Second, whether a system has memory or not is independent of its homogeneity.\n- D provides an incorrect reason. The dependence on a past input, $x[n-1]$, relates to whether the system has memory, not directly to homogeneity. Also, it incorrectly conflates this with time-variance. The property that makes it not homogeneous is the non-linear multiplication of signal values.\n- E is incorrect. The property fails for both real and complex values of $a$ (and $x[n]$), so restricting the input type does not make the system homogeneous.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1724520"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem introduces a critical subtlety often encountered in advanced signals and systems, quantum mechanics, and communications theory: the distinction between real and complex scalars.
