This system $G(s)$ is known to have a real-valued impulse response. The system $G(s)$ is then placed in a standard unity negative feedback configuration, creating a closed-loop system with transfer function $T(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}$.\n\nThis closed-loop system is designed to satisfy the following specifications:\n1.

The closed-loop transfer function is given by $T(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}$, where $G(s)=H_1(s)H_2(s)$.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the nulling condition.\nThe problem states that the closed-loop system completely nullifies a sinusoidal input of angular frequency $\\omega_0 = 3$ rad/s in the steady state. For an input $x(t) = \\cos(3t)$, the steady-state output is $y_{ss}(t) = |T(j3)|\\cos(3t + \\angle T(j3))$. For this output to be zero for all time $t$, we must have $|T(j3)|=0$, which implies $T(j3)=0$.\nFrom the expression for $T(s)$, we have $T(j3) = \\frac{G(j3)}{1+G(j3)} = 0$. This requires the numerator $G(j3)$ to be zero, assuming the denominator $1+G(j3)$ is finite (which is true for any stable or marginally stable system). Thus, the forward-path transfer function $G(s)$ must have a zero at $s=j3$.\n\nStep 2: Use the real-valued impulse response property of $G(s)$.\nA system with a real-valued impulse response must have a transfer function $G(s)$ where all non-real poles and zeros occur in complex conjugate pairs. Since $G(s)$ has a zero at $s=j3$, it must also have a zero at the conjugate location, $s=-j3$.\nTherefore, the numerator of $G(s)$ must be proportional to the factor $(s-j3)(s+j3) = s^2+9$.\n\nStep 3: Relate the properties of $G(s)$ to $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$.\nWe are given that $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ are first-order systems. Their general forms are $H_1(s)=K_1\\frac{s-z_1}{s-p_1}$ and $H_2(s)=K_2\\frac{s-z_2}{s-p_2}$.\nThe product is $G(s) = K_1 K_2 \\frac{(s-z_1)(s-z_2)}{(s-p_1)(s-p_2)}$.\nFrom Step 2, the numerator of $G(s)$ must be proportional to $s^2+9$. This means the set of zeros $\\{z_1, z_2\\}$ must be $\\{j3, -j3\\}$. Since $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ are first-order, they each have one zero. We must assign one conjugate zero to each system. Let's assign the zero of $H_1(s)$ to be $z_1$ and the zero of $H_2(s)$ to be $z_2$. Note that this assignment will be uniquely determined by the given DC gain of $H_1(s)$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the poles of $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$.\nThe pole of $H_1(s)$ is given as $p_1 = -2+j$. The system $H_1(s)$ is stable since $\\text{Re}\\{p_1\\} = -2 < 0$.\nThe problem states that $G(s)=H_1(s)H_2(s)$ has a real-valued impulse response. This requires its set of poles $\\{p_1, p_2\\}$ to be closed under complex conjugation. Since $p_1 = -2+j$ is a non-real pole, $p_2$ must be its complex conjugate, $p_2 = p_1^* = -2-j$.\nSo, the denominator of $H_1(s)$ is $(s-p_1) = s-(-2+j) = s+2-j$.\nThe denominator of $H_2(s)$ is $(s-p_2) = s-(-2-j) = s+2+j$.\n\nStep 5: Use the DC gain of $H_1(s)$ to find its transfer function.\nThe transfer function $H_1(s)$ is of the form $K_1 \\frac{s-z_1}{s+2-j}$, where $z_1$ is either $j3$ or $-j3$. Let's test both possibilities using the given DC gain $H_1(0) = \\frac{1-j}{2}$.\nCase A: $z_1 = j3$.\n$H_1(s) = K_1 \\frac{s-j3}{s+2-j}$.\n$H_1(0) = K_1 \\frac{-j3}{2-j} = \\frac{1-j}{2}$.\n$K_1 = \\frac{(1-j)(2-j)}{2(-j3)} = \\frac{2-j-2j+j^2}{-j6} = \\frac{1-3j}{-j6} = \\frac{(1-3j)j}{(-j6)j} = \\frac{j-3j^2}{6} = \\frac{3+j}{6}$.\n\nCase B: $z_1 = -j3$.\n$H_1(s) = K_1 \\frac{s+j3}{s+2-j}$.\n$H_1(0) = K_1 \\frac{j3}{2-j} = \\frac{1-j}{2}$.\n$K_1 = \\frac{(1-j)(2-j)}{2(j3)} = \\frac{1-3j}{j6} = \\frac{(1-3j)(-j)}{(j6)(-j)} = \\frac{-j+3j^2}{6} = \\frac{-3-j}{6}$.\n\nThe problem gives constraints that uniquely define the systems, so we proceed with Case A. (If we were to proceed with Case B, we would find a corresponding $H_2$ that would ultimately result in the same $G(s)$, so the overall system is the same, but the individual components $H_1, H_2$ would be swapped and scaled differently).\nSo, we have determined $H_1(s)$ completely:\n$H_1(s) = \\frac{3+j}{6} \\frac{s-j3}{s+2-j}$.\nSince $z_1=j3$, we must have $z_2 = -j3$ for $H_2(s)$.\n\nStep 6: Determine the transfer function $H_2(s)$.\nWe have $H_2(s) = K_2 \\frac{s-z_2}{s-p_2} = K_2 \\frac{s+j3}{s+2+j}$. We need to find the gain $K_2$.\n\nStep 7: Use the closed-loop DC gain specification.\nThe closed-loop DC gain is $T(0) = \\frac{G(0)}{1+G(0)} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\nSolving for $G(0)$: $5G(0) = 4(1+G(0)) \\implies 5G(0) = 4+4G(0) \\implies G(0) = 4$.\nNow, let's compute $G(0)$ from the expressions for $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$.\n$G(s) = H_1(s)H_2(s) = \\left(K_1 \\frac{s-j3}{s+2-j}\\right) \\left(K_2 \\frac{s+j3}{s+2+j}\\right) = K_1 K_2 \\frac{s^2+9}{(s+2-j)(s+2+j)} = K_1 K_2 \\frac{s^2+9}{(s+2)^2 - j^2} = K_1 K_2 \\frac{s^2+9}{s^2+4s+5}$.\nSo, $G(0) = K_1 K_2 \\frac{9}{5}$.\nEquating this with our required value: $K_1 K_2 \\frac{9}{5} = 4 \\implies K_1 K_2 = \\frac{20}{9}$.\nLet $K_{\\text{total}} = K_1 K_2 = \\frac{20}{9}$. Note that for $G(s)$ to have a real impulse response, the product of gains $K_1 K_2$ must be a real number. Our derived value $\\frac{20}{9}$ is indeed real.\n\nStep 8: Calculate $K_2$.\nWe know $K_1 = \\frac{3+j}{6}$ and $K_1 K_2 = \\frac{20}{9}$.\n$K_2 = \\frac{K_{\\text{total}}}{K_1} = \\frac{20/9}{(3+j)/6} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 6}{9(3+j)} = \\frac{120}{9(3+j)} = \\frac{40}{3(3+j)}$.\nTo rationalize the denominator:\n$K_2 = \\frac{40(3-j)}{3(3+j)(3-j)} = \\frac{40(3-j)}{3(3^2 - j^2)} = \\frac{40(3-j)}{3(9+1)} = \\frac{40(3-j)}{30} = \\frac{4(3-j)}{3}$.\n\nStep 9: Assemble the final expression for $H_2(s)$.\nSubstituting the value of $K_2$ into the expression for $H_2(s)$:\n$H_2(s) = \\frac{4(3-j)}{3} \\frac{s+j3}{s+2+j}$.\nThis is the required transfer function.\nBoth $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ are stable because their poles $(-2+j$ and $-2-j)$ are in the left-half of the s-plane.\nLet's check the stability of the closed-loop system. The characteristic equation is $1+G(s)=0$.\n$1 + \\frac{20}{9}\\frac{s^2+9}{s^2+4s+5} = 0$\n$s^2+4s+5 + \\frac{20}{9}(s^2+9) = 0$\n$9(s^2+4s+5) + 20(s^2+9) = 0$\n$9s^2+36s+45 + 20s^2+180 = 0$\n$29s^2+36s+225=0$.\nBy the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for a second-order polynomial, since all coefficients are positive, the roots must have negative real parts, and the closed-loop system is stable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4(3-j)}{3} \\frac{s+j3}{s+2+j}}$$", "id": "1701506"}]}
