For any scalar $\\alpha$, note the max-min scaling identities:\n- If $\\alpha \\ge 0$, then $\\max\\{\\alpha a_{i}\\} = \\alpha \\max\\{a_{i}\\}$ and $\\min\\{\\alpha a_{i}\\} = \\alpha \\min\\{a_{i}\\}$.\n- If $\\alpha < 0$, then $\\max\\{\\alpha a_{i}\\} = \\alpha \\min\\{a_{i}\\}$ and $\\min\\{\\alpha a_{i}\\} = \\alpha \\max\\{a_{i}\\}$.\nTherefore,\n- For $\\alpha \\ge 0$,\n$$T\\{\\alpha x\\}[n] = \\alpha M[n] - \\alpha m[n] = \\alpha\\big(M[n]-m[n]\\big) = \\alpha\\,T\\{x\\}[n].$$\n- For $\\alpha < 0$,\n$$T\\{\\alpha x\\}[n] = \\alpha m[n] - \\alpha M[n] = \\alpha\\big(m[n]-M[n]\\big) = -\\alpha\\big(M[n]-m[n]\\big).$$\nHomogeneity would require $T\\{\\alpha x\\}[n] = \\alpha T\\{x\\}[n] = \\alpha\\big(M[n]-m[n]\\big)$, but for $\\alpha0$ we have $T\\{\\alpha x\\}[n] = -\\alpha\\big(M[n]-m[n]\\big) \\ne \\alpha\\big(M[n]-m[n]\\big)$ unless $M[n]=m[n]$ (a nongeneric case).
