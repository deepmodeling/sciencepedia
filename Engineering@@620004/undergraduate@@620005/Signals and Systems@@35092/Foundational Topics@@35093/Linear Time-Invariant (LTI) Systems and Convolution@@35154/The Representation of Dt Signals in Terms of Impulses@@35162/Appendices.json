This representation, often called the sifting property, is given by the convolution sum:\n$$x[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k]\\delta[n-k]$$\nNow, consider a new signal $y[n]$ which is derived from $x[n]$ through a combination of time-reversal and a time-shift.

The general form of this representation is given as $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c[k]\\delta[n-k]$.\n\nWe begin with the definition of $y[n]$:\n$$y[n] = x[N_0 - n]$$\n\nTo express this in terms of impulses, we can utilize the sifting property for the signal $x$ at the specific time index $(N_0 - n)$. The sifting property states $g[m] = \\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} g[j]\\delta[m-j]$ for any signal $g$ and index $m$. Applying this to our signal $x$ with the argument $N_0-n$, we get:\n$$x[N_0 - n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[m]\\delta[(N_0 - n) - m]$$\nHere, the dummy index for the summation is chosen as $m$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $y[n]$:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[m]\\delta[N_0 - n - m]$$\n\nWe need to manipulate this expression to match the target form $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c[k]\\delta[n-k]$. The key is to make the argument of the delta function appear as $n-k$.\n\nFirst, we use the property that the unit impulse function $\\delta[\\cdot]$ is an even function, i.e., $\\delta[j] = \\delta[-j]$ for any integer $j$. Applying this property, we can write:\n$$\\delta[N_0 - n - m] = \\delta[-(N_0 - n - m)] = \\delta[n + m - N_0]$$\n\nFactoring the argument to isolate $n$, we have:\n$$\\delta[n + m - N_0] = \\delta[n - (N_0 - m)]$$\n\nSubstituting this transformed delta function back into the expression for $y[n]$ gives:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[m]\\delta[n - (N_0 - m)]$$\n\nThis expression is now very close to the desired form. To make the correspondence exact, we perform a change of variable for the summation index. Let the new summation index be $k$, defined as:\n$$k = N_0 - m$$\nAs the old index $m$ runs over all integers from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, the new index $k$ also runs over all integers from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. We can express the old index $m$ in terms of the new index $k$ as:\n$$m = N_0 - k$$\n\nNow we substitute $k$ for $N_0 - m$ in the argument of the delta function and $N_0 - k$ for $m$ in the term $x[m]$:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[N_0 - k]\\delta[n - k]$$\n\nThis expression is now precisely in the target form $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c[k]\\delta[n-k]$. By comparing the two expressions term by term within the summation, we can directly identify the coefficients $c[k]$.\n$$c[k] = x[N_0 - k]$$\nThus, the coefficients of the impulse expansion of the time-reversed and shifted signal $y[n]$ are the time-reversed and shifted values of the original signal $x[n]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x[N_0-k]}$$", "id": "1765187"}, {"introduction": "While any signal can be represented by impulses, the impulse response $h[n]$ of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system is a special signal that fully defines its behavior.

For a discrete-time LTI system to be causal, its impulse response $h[n]$ must be zero for all negative time indices, i.e., $h[n] = 0$ for all $n < 0$. The given impulse response is $h[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} c_k \\delta[n-k]$. The Kronecker delta function, $\\delta[n-k]$, is non-zero only when its argument is zero, which occurs at $n=k$. In the given summation, the index $k$ ranges from $0$ to $M-1$. This means that the impulses are located at non-negative time indices $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, M-1$. Consequently, for any $n < 0$, all terms $\\delta[n-k]$ in the sum are zero, which implies $h[n] = 0$ for $n < 0$. Therefore, the given form of the impulse response inherently represents a causal system. The causality constraint does not impose any additional restrictions on the coefficients $c_k$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the unity DC gain constraint. The frequency response, $H(\\omega)$, of a discrete-time LTI system is given by the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of its impulse response $h[n]$:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] \\exp(-j\\omega n)$$\nwhere $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nWe substitute the expression for $h[n]$ into the DTFT formula:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} c_k \\delta[n-k] \\right) \\exp(-j\\omega n)$$\nSince the sums are finite and well-behaved, we can interchange the order of summation:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} c_k \\left( \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta[n-k] \\exp(-j\\omega n) \\right)$$\nThe inner summation can be evaluated using the sifting property of the Kronecker delta function, which states that $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f[n]\\delta[n-k] = f[k]$. In this case, our function is $f[n] = \\exp(-j\\omega n)$. Applying the property, we get:\n$$\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta[n-k] \\exp(-j\\omega n) = \\exp(-j\\omega k)$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $H(\\omega)$, we find the frequency response of the FIR filter:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} c_k \\exp(-j\\omega k)$$\nThe DC gain is the value of the frequency response at $\\omega=0$. So, we evaluate $H(\\omega)$ at $\\omega=0$:\n$$H(0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} c_k \\exp(-j \\cdot 0 \\cdot k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} c_k \\exp(0)$$\nSince $\\exp(0) = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$H(0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} c_k$$\nThe problem states that the filter must have a unity DC gain, which means $H(0)=1$.
