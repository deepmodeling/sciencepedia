The solution involves two main steps: first, determining the function $y(t)$ by performing the convolution, and second, integrating the square of $y(t)$ to find its energy.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the convolution $y(t) = x(t) * x(t)$.**\n\nThe signal $x(t) = u(t) - u(t-T)$ is a rectangular pulse of amplitude 1 for $0 \\le t < T$ and 0 otherwise. The convolution integral is:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(\\tau)x(t-\\tau) d\\tau$$\nSince $x(\\tau)$ is non-zero only for $0 \\le \\tau < T$, the integral limits can be reduced:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} x(t-\\tau) d\\tau$$\nThe term $x(t-\\tau)$ represents a time-reversed and shifted version of $x(\\tau)$.

Since $y(t)$ is real and non-negative, $|y(t)|^2 = y(t)^2$. We only need to integrate over the interval where $y(t)$ is non-zero, i.e., from $0$ to $2T$. We split the integral into the two parts corresponding to the piecewise definition of $y(t)$.\n$$E_y = \\int_{0}^{2T} y(t)^2 dt = \\int_{0}^{T} t^2 dt + \\int_{T}^{2T} (2T - t)^2 dt$$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the integral from $0$ to $T$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} t^2 dt = \\left[ \\frac{t^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{T^3}{3} - 0 = \\frac{T^3}{3}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the integral from $T$ to $2T$. We can use a substitution $u = 2T - t$, which means $du = -dt$. When $t=T$, $u=T$. When $t=2T$, $u=0$.\n$$\\int_{T}^{2T} (2T - t)^2 dt = \\int_{T}^{0} u^2 (-du) = \\int_{0}^{T} u^2 du = \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{T^3}{3}$$\n\nFinally, we sum the results of the two integrals to find the total energy $E_y$:\n$$E_y = \\frac{T^3}{3} + \\frac{T^3}{3} = \\frac{2T^3}{3}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2T^{3}}{3}}$$", "id": "1743523"}, {"introduction": "Beyond calculating an output, one of the most powerful applications of convolution is in system identification.
