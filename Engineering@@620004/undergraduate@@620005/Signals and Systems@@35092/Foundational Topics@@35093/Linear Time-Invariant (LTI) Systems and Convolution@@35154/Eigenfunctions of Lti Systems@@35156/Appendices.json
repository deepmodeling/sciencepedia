Consider the task of designing a discrete-time, causal, real-valued Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, with an impulse response denoted by $h[n]$.\n\nThis filter must be designed to completely nullify two specific types of input signals:\n1.

An FIR filter is an LTI system. Complex exponentials of the form $x[n] = e^{j\\omega n}$ are eigenfunctions of LTI systems. When such a signal is input to a system with impulse response $h[n]$, the output is $y[n] = H(e^{j\\omega}) e^{j\\omega n}$, where $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is the frequency response of the filter, which is the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of $h[n]$.\n\nThe two input signals can be expressed as complex exponentials:\n1.  The DC input is $x_{DC}[n] = C = C \\cdot e^{j0 \\cdot n}$. This signal corresponds to the digital frequency $\\omega = 0$.\n2.

For an eigenfunction input, this means the corresponding eigenvalue must be zero. The eigenvalue for the input $e^{j\\omega n}$ is the frequency response $H(e^{j\\omega})$ evaluated at that frequency.\nTherefore, the two conditions on the filter can be translated into conditions on its frequency response:\n1.  To nullify the DC input: $H(e^{j0}) = 0$.\n2.  To nullify the Nyquist-frequency input: $H(e^{j\\pi}) = 0$.\n\nThe frequency response of a causal FIR filter of length $N$ is given by:\n$$H(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] e^{-j\\omega n}$$\n\nLet's apply the two conditions to this expression:\nCondition 1: $H(e^{j0}) = 0$\n$$H(e^{j0}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] e^{-j0 \\cdot n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] = h[0] + h[1] + \\dots + h[N-1] = 0$$\nThis means the sum of the filter coefficients must be zero.\n\nCondition 2: $H(e^{j\\pi}) = 0$\n$$H(e^{j\\pi}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] e^{-j\\pi n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] (-1)^n = h[0] - h[1] + h[2] - \\dots + (-1)^{N-1}h[N-1] = 0$$\nThis means the alternating sum of the filter coefficients must be zero.\n\nNow, we need to find the shortest non-trivial filter, which means finding the smallest integer $N \\geq 1$ for which there exists a non-zero solution for the coefficients $h[n]$.\n\nLet's test values of $N$:\n-   **Case N=1:** The impulse response is $[h[0]]$.\n    The equations become $h[0]=0$.

Substituting back into the first equation gives $h[1]=0$. The only solution is $[0, 0]$, which is again the trivial filter.\n\n-   **Case N=3:** The impulse response is $[h[0], h[1], h[2]]$.\n    The equations are:\n    1.  $h[0] + h[1] + h[2] = 0$\n    2.  $h[0] - h[1] + h[2] = 0$\n    We have a system of two linear equations with three unknowns, so a non-trivial solution is expected.\n    Let's solve the system. Adding the two equations:\n    $(h[0] + h[1] + h[2]) + (h[0] - h[1] + h[2]) = 0 \\implies 2h[0] + 2h[2] = 0 \\implies h[2] = -h[0]$.\n    Subtracting the second equation from the first:\n    $(h[0] + h[1] + h[2]) - (h[0] - h[1] + h[2]) = 0 \\implies 2h[1] = 0 \\implies h[1] = 0$.\n    So, any impulse response of the form $[h[0], 0, -h[0]]$ for a non-zero $h[0]$ is a solution. This is a non-trivial solution, and since $N=1$ and $N=2$ only yielded trivial solutions, $N=3$ is the shortest possible length.\n\nFinally, we apply the normalization conditions to find the unique answer. The impulse response is $[h[0], 0, -h[0]]$.\n-   The first non-zero coefficient must be positive, which means $h[0] > 0$.\n-   The coefficient with the largest absolute value must be 1. The coefficients are $h[0]$, $0$, and $-h[0]$. Their absolute values are $|h[0]|$, $0$, and $|-h[0]|=|h[0]|$. Thus, we must have $|h[0]| = 1$.\n\nCombining $h[0]>0$ and $|h[0]|=1$, we get $h[0]=1$.\nWith $h[0]=1$, we find the other coefficients:\n-   $h[1] = 0$\n-   $h[2] = -h[0] = -1$\n\nThe required impulse response sequence is $[1, 0, -1]$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{[1, 0, -1]} $$", "id": "1716628"}]}
