We will analyze each option against this definition.\n\n**Option A:**\nThe input is $x(t) = u(t)$. The unit step function $u(t)$ is defined to be zero for all $t < 0$.

By definition, this ensures that $y(t) = 0$ for all $t < 0$.\nTherefore, this observation is consistent with the initial rest condition.\n\n**Option C:**\nThe input is $x(t) = \\delta(t-1)$. The Dirac delta function $\\delta(t-1)$ is zero for all $t \\neq 1$. Specifically, the input is zero for all $t < 1$.

This shifted unit step function is zero for all $t < -1$. So, we have $t_0 = -1$.\nThe initial rest condition requires the output $y(t)$ to be zero for all $t < -1$.\nThe observed output is $y(t) = \\sinh(t)$.
