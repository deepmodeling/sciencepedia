The convolution is defined as $y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k]h[n-k]$. We will solve this by first determining the explicit sample values of $x[n]$ and $h[n]$, and then performing the convolution, typically using a graphical interpretation.\n\nFirst, let's determine the non-zero values of the signals $x[n]$ and $h[n]$.\nThe signal $x[n] = u[n] - u[n-3]$.\n$u[n]$ is 1 for $n \\ge 0$ and 0 otherwise.\n$u[n-3]$ is 1 for $n-3 \\ge 0$, which means $n \\ge 3$, and 0 otherwise.\nSubtracting the two, $x[n]$ will be $1 - 0 = 1$ for $0 \\le n < 3$. For all other $n$, $x[n]$ is 0.\nSo, the non-zero values of $x[n]$ are $x[0]=1$, $x[1]=1$, and $x[2]=1$.\n\nThe signal $h[n] = u[-n+1] - u[-n-2]$.\n$u[-n+1]$ is 1 for $-n+1 \\ge 0$, which means $1 \\ge n$ or $n \\le 1$.\n$u[-n-2]$ is 1 for $-n-2 \\ge 0$, which means $-2 \\ge n$ or $n \\le -2$.\nSubtracting the two, $h[n]$ will be $1-0=1$ for the range where $u[-n+1]=1$ and $u[-n-2]=0$. This occurs for $n \\le 1$ and $n > -2$.\nSo, the non-zero values of $h[n]$ are for $-1 \\le n \\le 1$: $h[-1]=1$, $h[0]=1$, and $h[1]=1$.\n\nThe convolution $y[n]$ can be found by flipping one signal and shifting it across the other. Let's fix $x[k]$ as a function of the index $k$ and compute $h[n-k]$. The signal $h[n-k]$ is obtained by first time-reversing $h[k]$ to get $h[-k]$, and then shifting the result by $n$.\n$h[k]$ is a pulse from $k=-1$ to $k=1$.\n$h[-k]$ is a pulse from $k=-1$ to $k=1$. (It is symmetric about $k=0$).\n$h[n-k]$ is a pulse of length 3, with non-zero values for $n-k \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which simplifies to $k \\in \\{n-1, n, n+1\\}$.\n\nThe convolution sum $y[n]$ is the sum of the product $x[k]h[n-k]$ over all $k$. This sum will be non-zero only when the non-zero supports of $x[k]$ and $h[n-k]$ overlap.\nThe support of $x[k]$ is $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe support of $h[n-k]$ is $k \\in \\{n-1, n, n+1\\}$.\n\nWe can determine the range of $n$ for which $y[n]$ is non-zero. The overlap begins when the rightmost point of $h[n-k]$, which is $k=n+1$, enters the support of $x[k]$ at $k=0$. This gives $n+1=0$, so $n=-1$.\nThe overlap ends when the leftmost point of $h[n-k]$, which is $k=n-1$, leaves the support of $x[k]$ at $k=2$. This gives $n-1=2$, so $n=3$.\nTherefore, $y[n]$ is non-zero for $n \\in \\{-1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This tells us the correct option must have its support in the interval $[-1, 3]$. This eliminates options B, C, and E. We only need to check the values between options A and D.\n\nLet's compute $y[n]$ for each value of $n$ from -1 to 3:\n- For $n=-1$: The support of $h[-1-k]$ is $k \\in \\{-2, -1, 0\\}$. The only overlap with $x[k]$ (at $k \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$) is at $k=0$.\n$y[-1] = \\sum x[k]h[-1-k] = x[0]h[-1] = (1)(1) = 1$.\n\n- For $n=0$: The support of $h[0-k]=h[-k]$ is $k \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The overlap with $x[k]$ is at $k=0, 1$.\n$y[0] = \\sum x[k]h[-k] = x[0]h[0] + x[1]h[-1] = (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 2$.\n\n- For $n=1$: The support of $h[1-k]$ is $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The overlap with $x[k]$ is at all three points $k=0, 1, 2$. This is the case of full overlap.\n$y[1] = \\sum x[k]h[1-k] = x[0]h[1] + x[1]h[0] + x[2]h[-1] = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3$.\n\n- For $n=2$: The support of $h[2-k]$ is $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The overlap with $x[k]$ is at $k=1, 2$.\n$y[2] = \\sum x[k]h[2-k] = x[1]h[1] + x[2]h[0] = (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 2$.\n\n- For $n=3$: The support of $h[3-k]$ is $k \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$. The only overlap with $x[k]$ is at $k=2$.\n$y[3] = \\sum x[k]h[3-k] = x[2]h[1] = (1)(1) = 1$.\n\nFor any $n < -1$ or $n > 3$, there is no overlap between the supports of $x[k]$ and $h[n-k]$, so $y[n]=0$.\n\nThe resulting sequence of non-zero values for $y[n]$ over the interval $-1 \\le n \\le 3$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1\\}$.\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. The sequence $y[n]$ is non-zero only for $-1 \\le n \\le 3$, with values $\\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1\\}$. This matches our result exactly.\nD.
