The input signal $x_B(t)$ is a rectangular pulse of unit amplitude, non-zero on the interval $[0, 1]$. We can write $x_B(t)$ as:\n$$\nx_B(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n  1 & \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le 1 \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo evaluate the convolution integral, we use the graphical method of \"flip and slide\". We consider the signal $x_B(-\\tau)$, which is a rectangular pulse of unit amplitude on the interval $[-1, 0]$. Then we \"slide\" this pulse by shifting it by $t$, resulting in $x_B(t-\\tau)$, a rectangular pulse of unit amplitude on the interval $[t-1, t]$. We then find the integral of the product of $h(\\tau)$ and $x_B(t-\\tau)$ for all possible values of $t$. The signal $h(\\tau)$ is non-zero only for $\\tau \\in [0, 2]$. Thus, the integral is non-zero only when the support of $x_B(t-\\tau)$, which is $[t-1, t]$, overlaps with the support of $h(\\tau)$, which is $[0, 2]$.\n\nWe analyze the convolution in different intervals of $t$.\n\n1.  For $t < 0$: The interval $[t-1, t]$ is entirely to the left of $[0, 2]$. There is no overlap between $h(\\tau)$ and $x_B(t-\\tau)$. Thus, $y(t) = 0$.\n\n2.  For $0 \\le t < 1$: The right edge of the rectangular pulse $x_B(t-\\tau)$ is inside the support of $h(\\tau)$, while the left edge is not. The overlap interval is $[0, t]$.

The overlap interval is $[t-1, t]$. This interval contains the point $\\tau=1$ where the definition of $h(\\tau)$ changes. We must split the integral at $\\tau=1$.\n    $$y(t) = \\int_{t-1}^{t} h(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\int_{t-1}^{1} \\tau \\, d\\tau + \\int_{1}^{t} (2-\\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\n    Evaluating the integrals:\n    $$y(t) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\tau^2 \\right]_{t-1}^{1} + \\left[ 2\\tau - \\frac{1}{2}\\tau^2 \\right]_{1}^{t}$$\n    $$y(t) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(t-1)^2 \\right) + \\left( (2t - \\frac{1}{2}t^2) - (2 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\right)$$\n    $$y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(t^2 - 2t + 1) + 2t - \\frac{1}{2}t^2 - \\frac{3}{2}$$\n    $$y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t - \\frac{1}{2} + 2t - \\frac{1}{2}t^2 - \\frac{3}{2}$$\n    $$y(t) = -t^2 + 3t - \\frac{3}{2}$$\n    To find the maximum value in this interval, we take the derivative with respect to $t$ and set it to zero.\n    $$y'(t) = -2t + 3$$\n    Setting $y'(t) = 0$ gives $-2t + 3 = 0$, which yields $t = \\frac{3}{2}$.

Thus, $y(t) = 0$.\n\nSummarizing the behavior of $y(t)$: it increases from $t=0$ to $t=1$, continues to increase until $t=3/2$, and then decreases until it becomes zero at $t=3$. The global maximum must therefore occur at the critical point we found in the interval $[1, 2)$.\n\nThe time at which the output signal $y(t)$ reaches its maximum value is $t = \\frac{3}{2}$ seconds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "1723279"}, {"introduction": "While direct integration is always an option, an expert engineer often relies on intuition to quickly analyze a system's behavior.

Our goal is to find the shift amount $t$ that maximizes this area.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the functions involved in the integral with respect to the integration variable $\\tau$.\nThe input signal is $x(\\tau)$, a rectangular pulse of height 2 for $\\tau \\in [0, 0.5]$ and 0 otherwise. Because $x(\\tau)$ is non-zero only over this interval, we can simplify the limits of integration:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{0}^{0.5} x(\\tau) h(t-\\tau) d\\tau$$\nWithin this interval, $x(\\tau) = 2$. So we can write:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{0}^{0.5} 2 \\cdot h(t-\\tau) d\\tau = 2 \\int_{0}^{0.5} h(t-\\tau) d\\tau$$\n\nNow, let's consider the function $h(t-\\tau)$. This is obtained by first time-reversing $h(\\tau)$ to get $h(-\\tau)$ and then shifting it by $t$.\nThe impulse response $h(\\tau)$ is a symmetric triangular pulse with its peak at $\\tau=0$. Because it is an even function ($h(\\tau) = h(-\\tau)$), the time-reversed function $h(-\\tau)$ is identical to $h(\\tau)$.\nThe shifted function, $h(t-\\tau)$, is therefore a triangular pulse of the same shape, but its peak is located at $\\tau = t$.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the time $t$ that maximizes the integral $\\int_{0}^{0.5} h(t-\\tau) d\\tau$. This integral represents the area under the triangular pulse $h(t-\\tau)$ over the fixed window $\\tau \\in [0, 0.5]$.\n\nThe function $h(t-\\tau)$ is a non-negative, symmetric, unimodal function with its peak at $\\tau=t$. To maximize the area under this function over a fixed-width interval, we must position the interval such that it captures the highest possible values of the function. This occurs when the center of the integration interval is aligned with the peak of the function.\n\nThe integration interval is $[0, 0.5]$. The center of this interval is at $\\tau_{center} = \\frac{0 + 0.5}{2} = 0.25$.\nThe peak of the function $h(t-\\tau)$ is at $\\tau = t$.\nTo maximize the integral, we must align the peak of the function with the center of the interval. Therefore, we set:\n$$t = \\tau_{center} = 0.25$$\n\nSo, the maximum value of the output $y(t)$ occurs at $t=0.25$ seconds.\n\nFor a more formal verification, we can use calculus. Let $I(t) = \\int_{0}^{0.5} h(t-\\tau) d\\tau$. We find the maximum by setting the derivative with respect to $t$ to zero. Using the Leibniz integral rule:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\int_{0}^{0.5} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} h(t-\\tau) d\\tau$$\nLet $u = t-\\tau$.

The only real number that satisfies this is the midpoint between 0 and 0.5, which is:\n$$t = 0.25$$\nTo confirm it's a maximum, we check the second derivative of $I(t)$:\n$$\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = h'(t) - h'(t-0.5)$$\nThe derivative of the triangular pulse, $h'(t)$, is a piecewise constant function: $h'(t) = 2$ for $-2 < t < 0$ and $h'(t) = -2$ for $0 < t < 2$.\nAt $t=0.25$:\n$h'(0.25) = -2$ (since $0 < 0.25 < 2$)\n$h'(0.25 - 0.5) = h'(-0.25) = 2$ (since $-2 < -0.25 < 0$)\nThus, $\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2}\\bigg|_{t=0.25} = -2 - 2 = -4$.\nSince the second derivative is negative, $t=0.25$ corresponds to a local maximum.

The step function is 0 if its argument is negative, i.e., $t_1-\\tau < 0$, which implies $\\tau > t_1$. This means the integrand is non-zero only for $\\tau \\le t_1$.

It is a product of our unknown function $x(\\tau)$ and a weighting function $w(\\tau) = \\exp(\\tau/\\tau_c)$. Since $\\tau_c > 0$, the weighting function $w(\\tau)$ is a strictly increasing function of $\\tau$ over the integration interval $[0, t_1]$. The maximum value of this weighting function occurs at the right boundary of the interval, i.e., at $\\tau = t_1$.\n\nTo maximize the integral of a non-negative function $x(\\tau)$ multiplied by a weighting function $w(\\tau)$, under the constraint that the total area of $x(\\tau)$ is fixed, we should concentrate the entire area of $x(\\tau)$ at the point where the weighting function is maximum.\nAny portion of the area of $x(\\tau)$ placed at a point $\\tau < t_1$ would be multiplied by a smaller weight $w(\\tau) < w(t_1)$, resulting in a smaller value for the integral $I$.\nFurthermore, any portion of the area of $x(\\tau)$ placed at $\\tau > t_1$ would contribute zero to the integral $I$ (as the integral's upper limit is $t_1$), while still counting towards the total area constraint $Q$. This would reduce the amount of area available within the interval $[0, t_1]$, thereby reducing the maximum possible value of $I$.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to concentrate the entire area $Q$ of the function $x(t)$ at the single point $\\tau=t_1$. A function that is zero everywhere except for a single point and has a finite integral is the Dirac delta function, $\\delta(t)$.\nThe function that meets all these requirements is a delta function located at $t=t_1$ and scaled by the total area $Q$.\n\nSo, the optimal release rate profile is:\n$$x(t) = Q \\, \\delta(t - t_1)$$\n\nThis function is causal (since $t_1 > 0$), non-negative, and its total integral is $\\int_0^\\infty Q \\delta(t-t_1) dt = Q$.
