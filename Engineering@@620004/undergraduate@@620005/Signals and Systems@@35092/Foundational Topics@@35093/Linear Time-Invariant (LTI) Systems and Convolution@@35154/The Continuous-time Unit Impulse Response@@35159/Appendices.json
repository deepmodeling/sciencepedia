This implies $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)| dt = K$, where $K$ is a finite positive constant.\n5.  **Given**: $h(t)$ is not identically zero.

Let's consider an arbitrary time $t' < 0$. The impulse response at this time is:\n$$g(t') = \\frac{1}{2}[h(t') - h(-t')]$$\nSince $t' < 0$, the first term $h(t')$ is zero due to the causality of the original system.\n$$g(t') = \\frac{1}{2}[0 - h(-t')]$$\nNow consider the argument of the second term, $-t'$. Since $t' < 0$, it follows that $-t' > 0$.\nAs we established from the problem statement, $h(t)$ is not identically zero, and since it is causal, it must be non-zero for some positive time. Let's pick a specific time $t_0 > 0$ such that $h(t_0) \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate $g(t)$ at the time $t = -t_0$. Since $t_0 > 0$, we have $t = -t_0 < 0$.\n$$g(-t_0) = \\frac{1}{2}[h(-t_0) - h(-(-t_0))] = \\frac{1}{2}[h(-t_0) - h(t_0)]$$\nThe first term $h(-t_0)$ is zero because $-t_0 < 0$ and the original system is causal.\n$$g(-t_0) = \\frac{1}{2}[0 - h(t_0)] = -\\frac{1}{2}h(t_0)$$\nSince we chose $t_0$ such that $h(t_0) \\neq 0$, it follows that $g(-t_0) \\neq 0$. We have found a time $t < 0$ for which the impulse response $g(t)$ is non-zero. Therefore, the new system is **non-causal**.\n\n**Analysis of BIBO Stability:**\n\nTo determine if the new system is BIBO stable, we must check if its impulse response $g(t)$ is absolutely integrable. We need to evaluate the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left| \\frac{1}{2}[h(t) - h(-t)] \\right| dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t) - h(-t)| dt $$\nWe can use the triangle inequality, which states that for any two numbers (real or complex) $a$ and $b$, we have $|a - b| \\leq |a| + |b|$. Applying this to our integrand:\n$$|h(t) - h(-t)| \\leq |h(t)| + |-h(-t)| = |h(t)| + |h(-t)|$$\nSubstituting this back into the integral gives an upper bound:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( |h(t)| + |h(-t)| \\right) dt $$\nWe can split the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)| dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(-t)| dt \\right] $$\nWe are given that the original system is BIBO stable, so $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)| dt = K < \\infty$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second integral, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(-t)| dt$. We perform a change of variable by letting $\\tau = -t$. Then $d\\tau = -dt$. The limits of integration also change: as $t \\to -\\infty$, $\\tau \\to \\infty$; and as $t \\to \\infty$, $\\tau \\to -\\infty$.\n$$ \\int_{t=-\\infty}^{t=\\infty} |h(-t)| dt = \\int_{\\tau=\\infty}^{\\tau=-\\infty} |h(\\tau)| (-d\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| d\\tau $$\nThis integral is identical in form to the one for the original system's stability, so its value is also $K$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(-t)| dt = K $$\nSubstituting the values of the two integrals back into our inequality:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt \\leq \\frac{1}{2} [K + K] = K $$\nSince $K$ is a finite positive constant, the integral of $|g(t)|$ is bounded above by a finite value. This implies that the integral itself must be finite.\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt < \\infty $$\nTherefore, the new system is **BIBO stable**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe new system is non-causal and BIBO stable.
