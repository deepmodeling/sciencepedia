For bluff bodies like semi-trucks, the large turbulent wake created by flow separation means pressure drag is the dominant factor. This exercise provides a practical look at a common engineering solution, adding a fairing, to explore how reducing this dominant pressure drag can yield a large net benefit, even if it slightly increases skin friction drag from the added surface area.

The total aerodynamic drag on a standard truck at highway speeds is the sum of two main components: pressure drag (also known as form drag) and skin friction drag. For one of their standard truck models, extensive wind tunnel testing has shown that the pressure drag constitutes a fraction $f_p = 0.88$ of the total drag, with the remainder being skin friction drag.\n\nTo reduce fuel consumption, the company is considering installing a large, rigid fairing in the gap between the tractor and the trailer. This modification is designed to smooth the airflow over the vehicle. The installation of the fairing has two primary effects on the aerodynamics:\n1. It significantly streamlines the vehicle's shape, reducing the pressure drag component by a fraction $r_p = 0.55$.\n2. The added surface area of the fairing itself slightly increases the total skin friction drag component by a fraction $i_f = 0.25$.\n\nAssuming the truck operates under the same conditions before and after the modification, calculate the overall fractional reduction in the total aerodynamic drag force.
