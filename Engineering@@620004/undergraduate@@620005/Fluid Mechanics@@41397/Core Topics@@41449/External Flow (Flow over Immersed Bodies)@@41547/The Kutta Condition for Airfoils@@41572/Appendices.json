In an idealized potential flow model, the sharp trailing edge of an airfoil creates a mathematical singularity, predicting an infinite fluid velocity—a clear physical impossibility. This first practice [@problem_id:1800876] uses a simplified model to demonstrate how the Kutta condition acts as a physical constraint, selecting the precise amount of circulation needed to cancel this singularity and ensure the velocity remains finite and well-behaved.", "id": "1800876", "problem": "A simplified one-dimensional model is proposed to describe the fluid speed $v(x)$ near the sharp trailing edge of a stationary airfoil. In this model, $x$ is the distance from the trailing edge along the mean flow direction, with $x=0$ corresponding to the trailing edge itself. The speed is given by the superposition of a 'geometric' contribution, $v_g(x)$, and a 'circulatory' contribution, $v_c(x)$.\n\nThe geometric contribution, arising from the flow accommodating the sharp edge, is modeled as:\n$$v_g(x) = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{x}}$$\nwhere $K$ is a positive constant determined by the airfoil's thickness and curvature, with units of $\\text{m}^{3/2}/\\text{s}$.\n\nThe circulatory contribution is adjustable and is established by the flow to ensure physical behavior. It is parameterized by a dimensionless control variable $\\alpha$, which is directly proportional to the airfoil's angle of attack. This contribution is modeled as:\n$$v_c(x) = V_0 \\alpha - \\frac{S \\alpha}{\\sqrt{x}}$$\nwhere $V_0$ is a reference speed in m/s and $S$ is a sensitivity constant with units of $\\text{m}^{3/2}/\\text{s}$.\n\nThe total fluid speed is $v(x) = v_g(x) + v_c(x)$. The Kutta condition demands that the flow must leave the sharp trailing edge smoothly, which implies that the fluid speed $v(x)$ must approach a unique, finite value as $x \\to 0$. By applying the Kutta condition, the flow \"chooses\" the appropriate value of $\\alpha$.\n\nDetermine the resulting finite speed of the flow at the trailing edge, $v_{TE} = \\lim_{x\\to0} v(x)$.

The condition is not a universal rule; it applies specifically to airfoils with sharp trailing edges. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1800840] challenges you to consider an unconventional scenario—an airfoil in reversed flight—to critically assess why a rounded edge, now acting as the trailing edge, prevents the application of the Kutta condition and, consequently, a unique lift prediction from potential theory.", "id": "1800840", "problem": "An advanced experimental drone is designed with wings that use a perfectly symmetric airfoil. This design choice is intended to provide identical flight characteristics during both forward and backward horizontal flight. A standard airfoil is characterized by a rounded leading edge and a sharp, cusped trailing edge. During a test maneuver, the drone, initially in steady, level forward flight at speed $V_\\infty$ and a small positive angle of attack $\\alpha$, reverses its thrust to fly backward at the same speed $V_\\infty$, maintaining the same orientation with respect to the oncoming air. In this reversed-flow scenario, the original rounded leading edge now functions as the trailing edge, and the sharp trailing edge acts as the new leading edge.\n\nBased on the principles of potential flow theory and the Kutta condition, which of the following statements most accurately describes the aerodynamic situation for the airfoil in the reversed-flow case?\n\nA. The airfoil will generate a negative lift (a downward force) with a magnitude that is predictable and equal to the magnitude of the lift in forward flight, as the circulation is simply reversed.\nB. The Kutta condition is still satisfied, but at the point of maximum thickness of the airfoil, leading to a stable but significantly reduced lift force.\nC. The Kutta condition can no longer be satisfied at the new trailing edge, which is the rounded leading edge. Consequently, potential flow theory cannot be used to uniquely determine the circulation and therefore cannot provide a theoretical prediction for the lift.\nD. Because the airfoil is symmetric, the net lift generated in reversed flow at an angle of attack $\\alpha$ will be zero, although the drag will be significantly higher.\nE. The Kutta condition is now applied at the sharp new leading edge (the original trailing edge). This fixes the stagnation point at the sharp edge and determines a unique, non-zero circulation, allowing for a lift prediction.\n\n", "solution": "We analyze the lift production via potential flow theory and the Kutta condition. In potential flow, the lift per unit span is given by the Kutta–Joukowski theorem,\n$$\nL'=\\rho_{\\infty}V_{\\infty}\\Gamma,\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the circulation about the airfoil, $\\rho_{\\infty}$ is the freestream density, and $V_{\\infty}$ is the freestream speed. Thus, to predict lift, potential flow must determine a unique $\\Gamma$.\n\nFor a standard airfoil in forward flight with a sharp trailing edge, uniqueness is obtained by imposing the Kutta condition: the flow must leave the sharp trailing edge smoothly with finite velocity. This selects a unique circulation that eliminates a velocity singularity at the trailing edge and fixes the stagnation point at the trailing edge. For a symmetric airfoil at small angle of attack $\\alpha$, thin-airfoil theory then yields a unique nonzero $\\Gamma$ and a lift coefficient $c_{l}=2\\pi\\alpha$, consistent with $L'=\\rho_{\\infty}V_{\\infty}\\Gamma$.\n\nIn the reversed-flow case described, the geometry as seen by the oncoming flow is such that the original rounded leading edge becomes the new trailing edge, while the original sharp trailing edge becomes the new leading edge. At a rounded trailing edge, there is no geometric cusp at which a finite-velocity smooth departure condition must be enforced; the flow can leave the rounded edge smoothly for any superposed circulation. Therefore, the Kutta condition cannot be applied at the rounded trailing edge to select $\\Gamma$, and the potential-flow boundary-value problem does not yield a unique circulation: one may superpose any $\\Gamma$ and still satisfy Laplace’s equation and the no-penetration condition on a smooth, closed contour. Consequently, within inviscid potential flow, $L'$ is not uniquely determined in reversed flow.\n\nThis directly rules out a prediction of a definite negative lift equal in magnitude to forward flight (option A), because such a statement requires a uniquely determined circulation of opposite sign, which is not available. It also rules out option B, because there is no principle by which the Kutta condition migrates to the point of maximum thickness; the Kutta condition is specifically a trailing-edge condition at a sharp cusp. Option D is incorrect because zero lift corresponds to choosing $\\Gamma=0$, which is one admissible potential flow but is not uniquely selected by theory; one cannot assert that the lift must be zero. Option E is incorrect because the Kutta condition is not applied at the leading edge; it is a trailing-edge smooth-outflow condition. Making the original sharp trailing edge the new leading edge does not fix $\\Gamma$ in potential flow, and attempting to impose a trailing-edge Kutta condition at a leading edge is not the correct theoretical procedure for determining circulation.\n\nTherefore, based on potential flow and the Kutta condition, the correct statement is that, in reversed flow with a rounded trailing edge, the Kutta condition cannot be satisfied in a way that selects a unique circulation, and potential flow cannot predict the lift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "With a solid grasp of the 'why' and 'where' of the Kutta condition, we can now apply it to make quantitative predictions.
