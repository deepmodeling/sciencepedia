It travels at a constant top speed of $v_0 = 72.0$ km/h on a calm sea. At a certain moment, the engine is suddenly shut off, and the propeller is retracted, ceasing to provide thrust. The boat's subsequent motion is opposed primarily by the hydrodynamic drag force on its hull. This drag force is accurately modeled by the expression $F_D = \\frac{1}{2} C_D \\rho A v^2$, where $v$ is the speed of the boat.
