The power required to overcome aerodynamic resistance does not increase linearly with speed; as you will discover, the relationship is far more dramatic.

This final practice moves beyond pure calculation to the core principles governing the drag coefficient, $C_D$: the shape of an object and its effect on fluid flow. By comparing the drag characteristics of different cross-sections, from a bluff square to a streamlined airfoil [@problem_id:1780928], you will learn to reason about why some shapes are inherently more aerodynamic than others by minimizing flow separation and the resulting low-pressure wake.", "problem": "An aerospace engineering student is tasked with selecting a cross-sectional shape for a non-retractable support strut for an external sensor package on a low-speed reconnaissance drone. The goal is to minimize the aerodynamic drag on the strut. Three potential cross-sectional shapes are considered, all having the same frontal width $d$ when placed in the airflow:\n1. A square rod (shape S).\n2. A circular cylinder (shape C).\n3. A streamlined airfoil shape (shape A).\n\nThe drone operates in a regime where the airflow is uniform with velocity $v$ and density $\\rho$. The Reynolds number of the flow around the struts is high (on the order of $10^5$), but below the \"drag crisis\" regime for the circular cylinder. For these types of shapes (known as bluff and semi-bluff bodies), the total drag is heavily dominated by pressure drag, which is caused by the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces of the body due to the phenomenon of flow separation.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements correctly ranks the pressure drag coefficients ($C_{D,p}$) for the three shapes from lowest to highest and provides the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. $C_{D,p, A} < C_{D,p, C} < C_{D,p, S}$. This ranking is due to the extent of flow separation. The streamlined shape is designed to maintain attached flow, resulting in the smallest low-pressure wake. The flow around the circular cylinder separates past the widest point, creating a smaller wake than the square rod, where separation occurs abruptly at the sharp corners.\n\nB. $C_{D,p, S} < C_{D,p, C} < C_{D,p, A}$. This is because a blunter object is more effective at deflecting the flow. By imparting more momentum to the surrounding fluid, the fluid imparts a smaller reaction force on the object, leading to lower drag.\n\nC. $C_{D,p, A} \\approx C_{D,p, C} \\approx C_{D,p, S}$. Since all three shapes have the same frontal area, they must displace the same amount of fluid. According to Newton's third law, the force exerted on the fluid and the drag force on the object must be equal, so the drag coefficients are nearly identical.\n\nD. $C_{D,p, A} < C_{D,p, S} < C_{D,p, C}$. The streamlined shape has the lowest drag. The square rod is better than the cylinder because its sharp corners act to energize the boundary layer through vortex generation, which helps the flow stay attached longer and reduces the size of the wake.\n\nE. $C_{D,p, A} < C_{D,p, C} < C_{D,p, S}$. This is because the surface area of the shapes follows this order. A larger surface area leads to higher skin friction drag, which is the primary component of total drag for objects in flight.", "solution": "We seek the ordering of the pressure drag coefficients for three cross-sectional shapes at high Reynolds number below the drag crisis for a cylinder. The pressure drag coefficient is defined by\n$$\nC_{D,p}=\\frac{D_{p}}{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho v^{2}A},\n$$\nwhere $D_{p}$ is the pressure (form) drag, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the free-stream speed, and $A$ is the reference frontal area (for a 2D cross-section per unit span, $A$ is proportional to the common width $d$). Since the shapes are compared at the same $\\rho$, $v$, and the same reference $A$, ranking $C_{D,p}$ is equivalent to ranking $D_{p}$.\n\nIn the given Reynolds number regime, the total drag for bluff and semi-bluff cross-sections is dominated by pressure drag due to flow separation and the resulting wake. The magnitude of $D_{p}$ is controlled by the size and pressure level of the separated wake: larger, lower-pressure wakes produce larger $D_{p}$ and thus larger $C_{D,p}$.\n\nA streamlined airfoil cross-section is designed to maintain attached flow and achieve gradual pressure recovery along a tapered aft body, delaying or eliminating separation until the sharp trailing edge. This minimizes the wake size and raises the base pressure toward the ambient level. Therefore, $D_{p}$ is smallest and $C_{D,p}$ is minimized for the streamlined shape, so $C_{D,p,A}$ is the lowest.\n\nA smooth circular cylinder at subcritical Reynolds numbers develops an adverse pressure gradient past the front stagnation region that causes the boundary layer to separate at an angle well upstream of the rear stagnation point. This creates a broad, low-pressure recirculating wake. However, because the separation point is not at the very front but past the widest point, the wake is smaller than that of a square rod with sharp corners. Thus the cylinder has substantial pressure drag, but less than the square rod: $C_{D,p,C}$ is intermediate.\n\nA square rod features sharp leading edges that cause immediate separation at the corners. The shear layers do not reattach on the afterbody, leaving a large, low-pressure wake with very low base pressure. This maximizes the momentum deficit in the wake and therefore the pressure drag. Hence $C_{D,p,S}$ is the largest.\n\nCombining these physical arguments yields the ordering\n$$\nC_{D,p,A}<C_{D,p,C}<C_{D,p,S}.\n$$\nThis matches option A and its reasoning about separation extent and wake size.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons. Option B incorrectly asserts that blunter shapes reduce drag by imparting more momentum to the flow; in fact, greater lateral deflection and earlier separation increase the wake and the pressure drag in this regime. Option C incorrectly infers equal drag from equal frontal area; $C_{D,p}$ depends on the pressure distribution and wake, not solely on displaced frontal area. Option D incorrectly claims that sharp corners energize the boundary layer and delay separation; in reality, sharp corners precipitate immediate separation and enlarge the wake. Option E focuses on skin friction as the primary drag component, but for these bluff and semi-bluff bodies at high Reynolds number, pressure drag dominates total drag, so surface area and skin friction are not the controlling factors for $C_{D,p}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1780928"}]}
