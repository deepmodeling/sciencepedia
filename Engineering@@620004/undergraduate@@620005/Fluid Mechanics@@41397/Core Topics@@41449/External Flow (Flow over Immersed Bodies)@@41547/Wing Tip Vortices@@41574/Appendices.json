To analyze the aerodynamic interaction, the aircraft's wing is modeled as a simple horseshoe vortex. The aircraft has a mass $M = 3.00 \\times 10^{5}$ kg and a wingspan of $b = 60.0$ m. It flies at a constant velocity $V_{\\infty} = 240$ m/s through air with a density of $\\rho = 0.410$ kg/m$^{3}$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g=9.81$ m/s$^2$.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system where the aircraft flies in the positive $x$-direction. The wing's lifting line is modeled as a bound vortex segment located at $x=0$, spanning the $y$-axis from $y = -b/2$ to $y = +b/2$.

We will model the trailing vortices as two semi-infinite vortex filaments.\n\nFirst, we must determine the circulation strength, $\\Gamma$, of the vortices.
