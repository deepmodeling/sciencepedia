The maximum value is at $\\kappa=0$.\nPhysically, $\\kappa=0$ corresponds to an annulus where the inner radius is zero, which is simply a circular pipe of area $A$. The additional inner wall in an annulus for any $\\kappa > 0$ introduces more wetted perimeter and thus more viscous drag, reducing the flow rate compared to a simple pipe of the same cross-sectional area and pressure gradient.\n\nTherefore, the volumetric flow rate is maximized in the limit $\\kappa \\to 0$.
