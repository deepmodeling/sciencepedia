A viscous dielectric fluid is used as the coolant, which flows through smooth, circular pipes to dissipate heat from processors. The flow is maintained in the laminar regime to ensure silent and predictable operation.

This thought experiment asks you to analyze the behavior of a hypothetical \"inviscid\" fluid, which has zero viscosity [@problem_id:1753812]. By exploring this extreme case, we can clarify the indispensable role of viscous shear forces in creating the boundary layer and, consequently, the entire concept of hydrodynamic entry length.", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical fluid characterized by a constant density $\\rho$ and a dynamic viscosity of exactly zero ($\\mu=0$). This fluid is often referred to as an \"inviscid fluid\". The fluid flows from a large reservoir into a long, straight, circular pipe of constant diameter $D$. At the pipe entrance (axial position $x=0$), the velocity profile is perfectly uniform across the cross-section, given by $u(r) = U_0$, where $U_0$ is a constant velocity.\n\nThe hydrodynamic entry length, $L_e$, is defined as the distance from the pipe entrance to the point where the velocity profile becomes fully developed, meaning it no longer changes with increasing axial distance $x$.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the hydrodynamic entry length $L_e$ for this inviscid fluid flow?\n\nA. $L_e$ is a finite, non-zero value that is proportional to the pipe diameter $D$ and the flow velocity $U_0$.\n\nB. $L_e$ is infinitely long ($L_e \\to \\infty$) because the absence of viscous forces prevents the flow from ever reaching a stable, fully developed state.\n\nC. $L_e$ is exactly zero ($L_e = 0$) because the velocity profile is already fully developed at the entrance.\n\nD. The concept of an entry length is not applicable to inviscid flow, so $L_e$ is undefined.\n\nE. $L_e$ depends on the Reynolds number, which becomes infinite, implying a turbulent-like entry behavior even at low speeds.", "solution": "To determine the hydrodynamic entry length for an inviscid fluid, we must first understand the physical mechanism that causes the velocity profile to develop in a real, viscous fluid.\n\nThe hydrodynamic entry length, $L_e$, is the axial distance required for the flow to transition from an initial profile (often uniform) at the pipe inlet to a final, unchanging velocity profile known as the \"fully developed\" profile.\n\nIn a viscous fluid, the development of the velocity profile is driven by shear stresses. Due to the no-slip boundary condition, the fluid layer in direct contact with the stationary pipe wall must have zero velocity. The adjacent fluid layers are slowed down by viscous shear forces, described by Newton's law of viscosity, $\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dr}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\frac{du}{dr}$ is the velocity gradient. This region of retarded flow near the wall is called the boundary layer. As the fluid moves down the pipe, this boundary layer grows in thickness. The entry region is the section of the pipe where this boundary layer is growing. The flow is considered fully developed when the boundary layer has grown to fill the entire pipe, reaching the centerline.\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothetical case of an inviscid fluid, where the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ is exactly zero. The immediate consequence of $\\mu=0$ is that the shear stress $\\tau$ is always zero, regardless of the velocity gradient.\n\nWith no shear forces, there is no mechanism to slow the fluid down near the pipe wall. The no-slip boundary condition does not apply. Instead, the fluid is free to \"slip\" past the wall without any friction. The problem states that the fluid enters the pipe with a uniform velocity profile, $u(r) = U_0$. Since there are no viscous forces to alter this profile, every fluid particle continues to move down the pipe with the same constant velocity $U_0$. The velocity profile remains uniform, $u(r, x) = U_0$, for all axial positions $x \\ge 0$.\n\nAccording to the definition, a flow is fully developed when its velocity profile no longer changes with axial distance. For this inviscid flow, the velocity profile *never* changes; it is constant for all $x$. This means the flow is fully developed at the very entrance of the pipe, i.e., at $x=0$. The distance required for the flow to *become* fully developed is therefore zero. Hence, $L_e = 0$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this reasoning:\n- A is incorrect. A finite, non-zero entry length is characteristic of viscous flows where a boundary layer must grow. This process is absent here.\n- B is incorrect. This option incorrectly assumes that \"fully developed\" must mean a specific non-uniform profile (like the parabolic profile in viscous laminar flow). However, the definition is simply that the profile is unchanging with axial distance. A uniform profile that remains uniform is, by definition, fully developed.\n- C is correct. As explained above, the absence of viscous forces means the initial uniform profile never changes. Thus, the flow is fully developed from the beginning, and the entry length is zero.\n- D is incorrect. The concept of entry length is well-defined. We can ask the question of how long it takes for the profile to become unchanging. The answer is simply that it takes zero distance. The length is defined, and its value is 0.\n- E is incorrect. The Reynolds number, $\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho U_0 D}{\\mu}$, indeed approaches infinity as $\\mu \\to 0$. However, empirical correlations for entry length, like $L_e/D \\approx 0.06 \\text{Re}$ for laminar flow, are derived based on the physics of viscous boundary layer growth and are not applicable to an inviscid fluid. Furthermore, turbulence is a complex phenomenon involving vortex stretching and viscous dissipation of energy, concepts that are fundamentally tied to viscosity. Applying concepts of turbulence to a truly inviscid fluid is not appropriate in this context.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1753812"}]}
