The design of these bends involves a crucial trade-off. A very sharp bend (small radius) is spatially efficient but incurs a significant pressure loss due to flow separation and secondary flows. Conversely, a very gentle bend (large radius) reduces these separation effects but increases the total length of the pipe segment, leading to greater frictional losses.\n\nConsider a steady, incompressible fluid with a constant mean velocity $V$ flowing through a pipe of uniform inner diameter $D$.
