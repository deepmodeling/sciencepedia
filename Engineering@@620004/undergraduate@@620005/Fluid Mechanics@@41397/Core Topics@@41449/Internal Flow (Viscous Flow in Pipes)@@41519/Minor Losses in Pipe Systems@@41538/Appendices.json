The average velocity $V$ of the fluid is related to the volumetric flow rate $Q$ and the cross-sectional area of the pipe, $A$, by the equation:\n$$\nV = \\frac{Q}{A}\n$$\nSince the cross-sectional area of the pipe is $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$, the velocity is:\n$$\nV = \\frac{Q}{\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}} = \\frac{4Q}{\\pi D^2}\n$$\nBecause $Q$ and $D$ are identical for both circuits, the average velocity of the water, $V_w$, is equal to the average velocity of the oil, $V_o$. Let's denote this common velocity simply as $V$.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the pressure drop for each circuit.\n\nFor the water circuit, the fluid density is $\\rho_w$.

This leaves us with the final expression for the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P_o}{\\Delta P_w} = \\frac{\\rho_o}{\\rho_w}\n$$\nThe result shows that the ratio of the pressure drops is simply the ratio of the fluid densities. The viscosities of the fluids ($\\mu_w$ and $\\mu_o$), the pipe diameter ($D$), and the volumetric flow rate ($Q$) do not appear in the final expression for this ratio, as their effects are contained within the velocity term that cancels out.
