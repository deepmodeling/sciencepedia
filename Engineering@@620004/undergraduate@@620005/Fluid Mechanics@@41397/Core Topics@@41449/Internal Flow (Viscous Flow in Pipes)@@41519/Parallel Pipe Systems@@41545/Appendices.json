Currently, a horizontal segment of length $L$ consists of two identical parallel pipes, each with an internal diameter $D$. Water flows through this parallel system from a point A to a point B.

The corresponding head loss, $h_f$, is related to the pressure drop by $h_f = \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\rho g}$, where $\\rho$ is the density of the water and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. For the system to be equivalent, the relationship between the total volumetric flow rate, $Q_{total}$, and the head loss, $h_f$, must be the same for both the original parallel-pipe configuration and the new single-pipe configuration.\n\nThe head loss due to friction in a pipe is given by the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n$$h_f = f \\frac{\\ell}{D} \\frac{V^2}{2g}$$\nwhere $f$ is the Darcy friction factor, $\\ell$ is the pipe length, $D$ is the pipe diameter, and $V$ is the average fluid velocity.

So, $Q_{total} = Q_1 + Q_2$.\nFor parallel pipes, the head loss across each branch is the same and is equal to the total head loss across the system, $h_f$.\n$$h_{f,1} = h_{f,2} = h_f$$\nUsing our expression for head loss in terms of flow rate:\n$$h_f = \\frac{8 f L Q_1^2}{g \\pi^2 D^5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad h_f = \\frac{8 f L Q_2^2}{g \\pi^2 D^5}$$\nSince the pipes are identical (same $f$, $L$, and $D$), for the head losses to be equal, the flow rates must be equal: $Q_1^2 = Q_2^2$, which implies $Q_1 = Q_2$.\nFrom the conservation of mass, $Q_{total} = Q_1 + Q_2 = 2Q_1$. Thus, the flow in each parallel pipe is $Q_1 = \\frac{Q_{total}}{2}$.\nNow we can write the head loss for the parallel system in terms of the total flow rate:\n$$h_f = \\frac{8 f L Q_1^2}{g \\pi^2 D^5} = \\frac{8 f L \\left( \\frac{Q_{total}}{2} \\right)^2}{g \\pi^2 D^5} = \\frac{8 f L \\frac{Q_{total}^2}{4}}{g \\pi^2 D^5} = \\frac{2 f L Q_{total}^2}{g \\pi^2 D^5}$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the replacement single pipe system.\nThis pipe has a length $L_{eq}$ and a diameter $D$.
