Unlike plug flow, where fluid moves at a uniform speed, the velocity in a laminar regime varies from zero at the walls to a maximum at the centerline.

To visualize the flow, two small, neutrally buoyant tracer particles, particle A and particle B, are simultaneously released into the fluid at the same axial position. Particle A is released exactly on the centerline of the pipe (radial position $r_A = 0$), while particle B is released at a radial distance of $r_B = R/2$ from the centerline. Both particles are carried along by the fluid.\n\nLet $t_A$ be the time it takes for particle A to travel an axial distance $L$ down the pipe, and let $t_B$ be the time it takes for particle B to travel the same axial distance $L$.
