This practice [@problem_id:1804659] provides a classic scenario involving a fluid jet impacting a solid surface, challenging you to apply the momentum principle to calculate the necessary restraining force.", "problem": "A vertical cylindrical jet of water, directed downwards, strikes the apex of a solid cone. The cone's axis is aligned with the jet, and its apex points upward. The cone is held perfectly stationary by an external supporting force. The water jet has a velocity of $v_j = 12.0$ m/s and a diameter of $d_j = 2.50$ cm. The density of water is $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^3$.

Furthermore, neglect the weight of the water residing on the cone's surface and any change in the jet's speed due to gravity before it hits the cone.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the external vertical force required to keep the cone suspended and stationary. Provide your answer in newtons (N), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the external force required to hold a cone stationary against a downward-flowing water jet and its own weight. We can solve this by applying the linear momentum equation to a control volume that encloses the cone.\n\nLet the z-axis be the vertical direction, with positive defined as upwards. The linear momentum equation for a steady flow is:\n$$ \\sum \\vec{F} = \\sum_{\\text{out}} \\dot{m} \\vec{v} - \\sum_{\\text{in}} \\dot{m} \\vec{v} $$\nHere, $\\sum \\vec{F}$ is the sum of all external forces acting on the control volume, $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the fluid crossing the control surface. We are interested in the vertical component of this equation.\n\nThe external forces acting on the control volume (the cone and the water interacting with it) in the vertical direction are:\n1. The external supporting force, $F_{ext}$, acting upwards (positive z-direction).\n2. The weight of the cone, $W = Mg$, acting downwards (negative z-direction).\nThe problem states to neglect the weight of the water within the control volume. The inlet and outlet jets are open to the atmosphere, so we assume the net force due to pressure on the control surface is zero.\nTherefore, the sum of external forces in the z-direction is:\n$$ \\sum F_z = F_{ext} - Mg $$\n\nNext, we analyze the momentum flux terms. The mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}$, is constant due to the conservation of mass. It can be calculated at the inlet jet:\n$$ \\dot{m} = \\rho A_j v_j $$\nwhere $A_j$ is the cross-sectional area of the jet.\n$$ A_j = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d_j}{2}\\right)^2 $$\n\nNow, let's find the vertical components of the momentum flux at the inlet and outlet.\nAt the inlet (subscript 'in'), the water flows vertically downwards. So, the velocity vector is $\\vec{v}_{in} = -v_j \\hat{k}$, where $\\hat{k}$ is the unit vector in the positive z-direction. The vertical component of the velocity is $v_{z,in} = -v_j$.\nThe inlet momentum flux in the z-direction is:\n$$ (\\dot{m} v_z)_{in} = \\dot{m} (-v_j) = -\\dot{m} v_j $$\n\nAt the outlet (subscript 'out'), the water flows along the surface of the cone. The cone has a half-angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical axis. The velocity vector for the exiting water sheet makes an angle $\\theta$ with the vertical axis. The speed is given as $v_j$. The vertical component of the outlet velocity is directed downwards, so it is negative:\n$$ v_{z,out} = -v_j \\cos(\\theta) $$\nThe total mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ exits at this velocity. Due to axisymmetry, the horizontal components of the momentum flux cancel out. The total outlet momentum flux in the z-direction is:\n$$ (\\dot{m} v_z)_{out} = \\dot{m} (-v_j \\cos(\\theta)) = -\\dot{m} v_j \\cos(\\theta) $$\n\nNow, substitute the forces and momentum fluxes into the vertical component of the momentum equation:\n$$ \\sum F_z = (\\dot{m} v_z)_{out} - (\\dot{m} v_z)_{in} $$\n$$ F_{ext} - Mg = (-\\dot{m} v_j \\cos(\\theta)) - (-\\dot{m} v_j) $$\n$$ F_{ext} - Mg = \\dot{m} v_j (1 - \\cos(\\theta)) $$\nSolving for the external force $F_{ext}$:\n$$ F_{ext} = Mg + \\dot{m} v_j (1 - \\cos(\\theta)) $$\nSubstitute $\\dot{m} = \\rho A_j v_j$:\n$$ F_{ext} = Mg + (\\rho A_j v_j) v_j (1 - \\cos(\\theta)) $$\n$$ F_{ext} = Mg + \\rho A_j v_j^2 (1 - \\cos(\\theta)) $$\nThis equation shows that the external force must support the weight of the cone ($Mg$) and counteract the change in momentum of the fluid.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^3$\n- $d_j = 2.50$ cm $= 0.0250$ m\n- $v_j = 12.0$ m/s\n- $M = 5.00$ kg\n- $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$\n- $\\theta = 45.0^\\circ$\n\nFirst, calculate the jet area $A_j$:\n$$ A_j = \\pi \\left(\\frac{0.0250 \\text{ m}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi (0.0125 \\text{ m})^2 \\approx 4.9087 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2 $$\n\nNext, calculate the weight of the cone:\n$$ W = Mg = (5.00 \\text{ kg})(9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2) = 49.05 \\text{ N} $$\n\nThen, calculate the force component from the fluid's momentum change:\n$$ F_{fluid} = \\rho A_j v_j^2 (1 - \\cos(\\theta)) $$\n$$ F_{fluid} = (1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3)(4.9087 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2)(12.0 \\text{ m/s})^2 (1 - \\cos(45.0^\\circ)) $$\n$$ F_{fluid} = (1000)(4.9087 \\times 10^{-4})(144)(1 - 0.707106...) $$\n$$ F_{fluid} = (70.685)(0.292893...) \\approx 20.710 \\text{ N} $$\n\nFinally, add the two components to find the total external force:\n$$ F_{ext} = W + F_{fluid} = 49.05 \\text{ N} + 20.710 \\text{ N} = 69.760 \\text{ N} $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$ F_{ext} \\approx 69.8 \\text{ N} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{69.8}$$", "id": "1804659"}, {"introduction": "The principles of momentum are not limited to calculating static forces; they are also crucial for determining the power needed to sustain motion in dynamic systems.
