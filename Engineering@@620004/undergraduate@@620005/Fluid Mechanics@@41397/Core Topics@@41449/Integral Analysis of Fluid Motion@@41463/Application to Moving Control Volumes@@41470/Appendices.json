The key challenge is to distinguish between the momentum balance, which determines the force, and the energy balance, which relates to power. This exercise will teach you to carefully select the relevant physical principles and information to solve a problem efficiently.", "problem": "A conceptual design for a water-purification skimmer involves a vehicle that moves at a constant velocity $V$ across the surface of a stationary lake. The vehicle scoops up water, which has a density of $\\rho$, through a forward-facing inlet of cross-sectional area $A$. The collected water is then channeled through an internal system containing a turbine. The turbine harnesses the kinetic energy of the flow to generate a useful power output $\\mathcal{P}$ for the purification equipment. After passing through the turbine, the water is ejected from the vehicle. The design specifies that the ejection velocity of the water, as measured by an observer on the vehicle, is directed perfectly normal to the vehicle's path of motion. Assume the water pressure at both the intake and the exhaust ports is equal to the ambient atmospheric pressure and that the flow inside the vehicle is steady from the perspective of an observer on the vehicle.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the magnitude of the continuous braking force exerted by the water on the vehicle.

In the vehicle frame, the lake water approaches the forward-facing inlet with speed $V$ along $-x$ and pressure equal to ambient.

For such a control volume, the net pressure force in the $x$-direction cancels over the closed surface, so the only external $x$-force on the control volume is the force exerted by the vehicle (walls and turbine) on the fluid.
