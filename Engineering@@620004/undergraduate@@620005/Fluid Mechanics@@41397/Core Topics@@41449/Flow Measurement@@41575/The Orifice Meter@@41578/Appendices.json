This first exercise explores the fundamental scaling laws that govern this device under turbulent flow conditions, where the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is proportional to the square of the volumetric flow rate $Q$. By examining how changes in flow rate affect both the pressure drop and the energy dissipated by the meter, you will build a solid intuition for the core physics of this important instrument [@problem_id:1803314].", "problem": "A large-scale liquid cooling system for a high-performance computing cluster uses a centrifugal pump to circulate a coolant of constant density $\\rho$ through a long, straight pipe. To monitor the system's performance, an orifice meter is installed in the pipeline. The flow through the orifice meter is fully turbulent, and under these conditions, it is observed that the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is directly proportional to the square root of the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, across the orifice.\n\nInitially, the system operates at a steady volumetric flow rate $Q_1$. To handle an increased thermal load from the servers, an operator adjusts the pump settings, causing the steady-state volumetric flow rate to double, becoming $Q_2 = 2Q_1$.\n\nThe pressure drop across the orifice meter leads to an irreversible loss of mechanical energy, which is dissipated as heat. This dissipated power, $P_{diss}$, is given by the product of the volumetric flow rate and the pressure drop across the meter. By what factor does this dissipated power increase when the flow rate is doubled from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$? The final answer should be a single real number.", "solution": "Let the initial state of the system be denoted by subscript 1 and the final state by subscript 2. We are given the initial volumetric flow rate $Q_1$ and the final volumetric flow rate $Q_2$. The problem states that the flow rate is doubled, so we have the relation:\n$$Q_2 = 2Q_1$$\n\nThe problem specifies that for the turbulent flow through the orifice meter, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is proportional to the square root of the pressure drop $\\Delta P$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$Q = C \\sqrt{\\Delta P}$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the geometry of the orifice meter and the fluid properties, which are constant for this problem.\n\nFrom this relationship, we can express the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ in terms of the flow rate $Q$:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{Q^2}{C^2}$$\nThis shows that the pressure drop across the orifice is proportional to the square of the volumetric flow rate, i.e., $\\Delta P \\propto Q^2$.\n\nLet $\\Delta P_1$ be the pressure drop corresponding to the flow rate $Q_1$, and $\\Delta P_2$ be the pressure drop corresponding to the flow rate $Q_2$. We can find the relationship between $\\Delta P_1$ and $\\Delta P_2$ by taking the ratio of the pressure drops:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_2}{\\Delta P_1} = \\frac{Q_2^2 / C^2}{Q_1^2 / C^2} = \\left(\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting $Q_2 = 2Q_1$, we find:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_2}{\\Delta P_1} = \\left(\\frac{2Q_1}{Q_1}\\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4$$\nThus, the new pressure drop is four times the original pressure drop:\n$$\\Delta P_2 = 4 \\Delta P_1$$\n\nNext, we are asked to find the factor by which the dissipated power, $P_{diss}$, increases. The problem states that the dissipated power is the product of the volumetric flow rate and the pressure drop:\n$$P_{diss} = Q \\cdot \\Delta P$$\n\nFor the initial state, the dissipated power is:\n$$P_{diss, 1} = Q_1 \\Delta P_1$$\nFor the final state, the dissipated power is:\n$$P_{diss, 2} = Q_2 \\Delta P_2$$\n\nTo find the factor of increase, we compute the ratio $\\frac{P_{diss, 2}}{P_{diss, 1}}$. We substitute the expressions for $Q_2$ and $\\Delta P_2$ in terms of their initial values:\n$$\\frac{P_{diss, 2}}{P_{diss, 1}} = \\frac{Q_2 \\Delta P_2}{Q_1 \\Delta P_1}$$\nUsing $Q_2 = 2Q_1$ and $\\Delta P_2 = 4 \\Delta P_1$, we get:\n$$\\frac{P_{diss, 2}}{P_{diss, 1}} = \\frac{(2Q_1)(4\\Delta P_1)}{Q_1 \\Delta P_1} = \\frac{8 Q_1 \\Delta P_1}{Q_1 \\Delta P_1} = 8$$\nTherefore, the dissipated power increases by a factor of 8.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1803314"}, {"introduction": "While the theoretical relationship between flow rate and pressure drop is straightforward, real-world accuracy depends on a correction factor known as the discharge coefficient, $C_d$.
