By comparing the ideal prediction with one based on the viscous Hagen-Poiseuille model, you will quantify the crucial role viscosity plays in many practical fluid flows. [@problem_id:1771933]", "problem": "A classic fluid mechanics challenge involves understanding the limitations of ideal fluid models. Consider the process of squeezing ketchup from a bottle.

We will calculate the expression for each volumetric flow rate separately and then find their ratio.\n\nFirst, we determine the volumetric flow rate using the ideal fluid model, $Q_{ideal}$. This model is based on Bernoulli's equation, which relates pressure, velocity, and height between two points in a moving fluid. Let point 1 be inside the main body of the bottle and point 2 be at the exit of the nozzle. Bernoulli's equation is:\n$$P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g z_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g z_2$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the bottle is horizontal, so the heights are equal ($z_1 = z_2$), and the gravitational potential energy terms cancel out. The velocity inside the large body of the bottle, $v_1$, is negligible ($v_1 \\approx 0$). The pressure at the nozzle exit, $P_2$, is atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm}$. The pressure inside the bottle is $P_1 = P_{atm} + \\Delta P$, where $\\Delta P$ is the given gauge pressure.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into Bernoulli's equation gives:\n$$(P_{atm} + \\Delta P) + 0 = P_{atm} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2$$\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2$$\n\nWe can now solve for the exit velocity, $v_2$, predicted by the ideal model:\n$$v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta P}{\\rho}}$$\n\nThe ideal volumetric flow rate, $Q_{ideal}$, is the product of the exit cross-sectional area, $A = \\pi r^2$, and the exit velocity, $v_2$:\n$$Q_{ideal} = A v_2 = (\\pi r^2) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta P}{\\rho}}$$\n\nNext, we determine the volumetric flow rate using the viscous flow model, $Q_{viscous}$. For laminar flow of a viscous fluid through a cylindrical pipe, the volumetric flow rate is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$Q_{viscous} = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nHere, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the length $L$ of the nozzle, which is the gauge pressure provided.\n\nNow we can compute the desired ratio, $\\frac{Q_{ideal}}{Q_{viscous}}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{ideal}}{Q_{viscous}} = \\frac{(\\pi r^2) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta P}{\\rho}}}{\\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}}$$\n\nWe simplify this expression algebraically:\n$$\\frac{Q_{ideal}}{Q_{viscous}} = (\\pi r^2) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta P}{\\rho}} \\times \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P} = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{r^2 \\Delta P} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta P}{\\rho}}$$\nTo create a cleaner expression for calculation, we can simplify this as:\n$$\\frac{Q_{ideal}}{Q_{viscous}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{2} \\mu L}{r^2 \\sqrt{\\rho \\Delta P}}$$\nThis is our final symbolic expression for the ratio.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.
