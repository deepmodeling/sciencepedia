The EGL represents the total mechanical energy head of the fluid at any point in the system. It is the sum of the elevation head ($z$), the pressure head ($\\frac{p}{\\rho g}$), and the velocity head ($\\frac{v^2}{2g}$), where $\\rho$ is the fluid density.\n$$EGL = z + \\frac{p}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v^2}{2g}$$\nTo analyze the system, we apply the steady-state energy equation between the free surface of the reservoir (point 1) and the free discharge outlet of the pipe (point 2).\n$$z_1 + \\frac{p_1}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v_1^2}{2g} = z_2 + \\frac{p_2}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v_2^2}{2g} + h_L$$\nHere, $h_L$ represents the total head loss in the pipe. Let's analyze the terms at points 1 and 2.\n\nAt point 1 (reservoir surface):\n- The reservoir is large, so the velocity of the free surface is negligible, $v_1 \\approx 0$.\n- The reservoir is open to the atmosphere, so the pressure is atmospheric, $p_1 = p_{atm}$. Using gauge pressure, $p_{1,gauge} = 0$.\n- The elevation is $z_1$.\n\nAt point 2 (pipe outlet):\n- The pipe discharges into the atmosphere, so the pressure is atmospheric, $p_2 = p_{atm}$. Using gauge pressure, $p_{2,gauge} = 0$.\n- The fluid is moving with a velocity $v_2$ just as it exits the pipe.\n- The elevation is $z_2$.\n\nThe head loss, $h_L$, is primarily due to friction in the pipe (major loss). For a pipe of constant diameter, the velocity $v$ is constant along its length, so $v = v_2$. The major head loss is given by the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n$$h_L = f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v_2^2}{2g}$$\nSubstituting these conditions into the energy equation:\n$$z_1 + 0 + 0 = z_2 + 0 + \\frac{v_2^2}{2g} + f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v_2^2}{2g}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the driving head, $z_1 - z_2$:\n$$z_1 - z_2 = \\frac{v_2^2}{2g} \\left(1 + f \\frac{L}{D}\\right)$$\nNow, let's analyze the effect of the decreasing reservoir level, $z_1$. The problem states that $z_1$ steadily decreases. From the equation above, the driving head ($z_1 - z_2$) decreases. Since $g$, $f$, $L$, and $D$ are constants, for the equality to hold, the flow velocity $v_2$ must also decrease.\n\nWith this understanding, we can analyze the characteristics of the EGL:\n\n1.  **Position of the EGL:** The EGL starts at the elevation of the total head at the beginning of the pipe. The total head in the reservoir is $z_1$. Thus, the EGL begins at an elevation just below $z_1$ (accounting for a minor entrance loss, but its position is fundamentally tied to $z_1$). As $z_1$ decreases, the entire energy budget of the system decreases, so the starting point of the EGL must also shift downwards.\n\n2.  **Slope of the EGL:** The slope of the EGL is a measure of the head loss per unit length. For a pipe of constant diameter where major losses dominate, the EGL has a nearly constant downward slope. The magnitude of this slope is given by $\\frac{h_L}{L}$.\n    $$\\text{Slope magnitude} = \\frac{h_L}{L} = \\frac{1}{L} \\left(f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v^2}{2g}\\right) = f \\frac{v^2}{2gD}$$\n    As we established, the velocity $v$ (which is equal to $v_2$) decreases as the reservoir level $z_1$ drops. Since the slope's magnitude is proportional to $v^2$, a decrease in $v$ will cause the slope to become smaller. A smaller slope means the EGL becomes less steep, or flatter (closer to horizontal).\n\nCombining these two findings:\n- The EGL shifts downwards because its starting point is determined by the decreasing reservoir level $z_1$.\n- The slope of the EGL becomes less steep because the decreasing flow velocity $v$ results in lower frictional head losses per unit length.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\nA. The EGL will shift downwards, and its slope will become less steep (i.e., closer to horizontal). - This matches our conclusion.\nB. The EGL will shift downwards, but its slope will remain constant. - Incorrect. The slope changes because the velocity changes.\nC. The starting point of the EGL at the pipe entrance will drop, but the endpoint at the pipe outlet will remain at a fixed elevation. - Incorrect. The elevation of the EGL at the outlet is $z_2 + \\frac{v_2^2}{2g}$. Since $v_2$ decreases, this elevation also drops.\nD. The EGL will shift downwards, and its slope will become steeper. - Incorrect. A steeper slope would imply higher head loss and higher velocity, which is the opposite of what happens.\nE. The EGL will remain in its initial position... - Incorrect. The total energy of the system is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the EGL shifts downwards and its slope becomes less steep.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1753269"}]}
