The **liquid-gas interface**: The curved surface where the water droplet is in contact with the air.\n2.  The **liquid-solid interface**: The flat circular area where the water droplet is in contact with the Teflon sheet.\n3.  The **three-phase contact line**: The circular line where the water, air, and Teflon sheet all meet. The static contact angle at this line is denoted by $\\theta_c$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete set of boundary conditions for this system?\n\nA. At the liquid-gas interface, $\\vec{v} = 0$. At the liquid-solid interface, the tangential component of velocity is zero, but the normal component is non-zero to allow for evaporation.
