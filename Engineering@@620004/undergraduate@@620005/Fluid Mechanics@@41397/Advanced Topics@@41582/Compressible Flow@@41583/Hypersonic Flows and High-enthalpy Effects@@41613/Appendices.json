A key instrument on the probe is a small, perfectly spherical sensor of radius $R$ that measures local properties. To analyze the extreme aerodynamic loads on this sensor, engineers employ a simplified impact theory. This theory operates on the following assumptions: (1) the incoming gas particles are non-interacting with each other before striking the sensor surface, and (2) upon impact, the component of a particle's momentum that is normal to the surface is completely transferred to the sensor, while the tangential component of its momentum is conserved.\n\nUsing this model, calculate the pressure coefficient, $C_p$, on the sensor's surface at a point located at an angle $\\theta = 25$ degrees from the stagnation point.
