This everyday item serves as an excellent model for a high-pressure reservoir exhausting to the atmosphere, a classic compressible flow problem. This exercise will guide you through calculating the critical temperature, $T^*$, of the gas as it exits the nozzle, a phenomenon you might have noticed as the can becomes cold during use. By applying the principles of isentropic flow to this choked condition, you will directly connect the initial stagnation temperature inside the can to the critical temperature at the nozzle exit [@problem_id:1745279].", "problem": "A can of compressed gas, often sold as an \"air duster\" for cleaning electronics, contains 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (a refrigerant gas) as its propellant. The can has been stored in a room for an extended period, allowing it to reach thermal equilibrium with the surroundings at a temperature of $298.15 \\text{ K}$. When the nozzle is actuated, the gas rapidly expands and exits into the atmosphere. For this analysis, you can model the propellant as a calorically perfect ideal gas with a specific heat ratio of $\\gamma = 1.22$. The expansion process through the nozzle can be treated as isentropic, and the velocity of the gas within the large volume of the can is negligible. The high pressure inside the can causes the flow to become choked, meaning the flow velocity at the narrowest point of the nozzle exit reaches the local speed of sound (Mach number $M=1$). The temperature at this point is defined as the critical temperature.\n\nCalculate this critical temperature of the gas as it exits the nozzle. Express your answer in Kelvin (K), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We model the propellant as a calorically perfect ideal gas and assume an isentropic expansion through the nozzle from a large reservoir (the can). The gas velocity in the can is negligible, so the can temperature equals the stagnation (total) temperature, denoted by $T_0$. Given the can has reached thermal equilibrium with the surroundings, $T_0 = 298.15 \\text{ K}$.\n\nFor isentropic flow of a perfect gas, the relation between the static temperature $T$ and the stagnation temperature $T_0$ at Mach number $M$ is\n$$\n\\frac{T}{T_0}=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M^{2}}.\n$$\nAt the choked condition (critical state) the Mach number at the throat is $M=1$, so the critical temperature $T^*$ satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{T^*}{T_0}=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}}=\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nT^* = T_0 \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}.\n$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma=1.22$ and $T_0=298.15 \\text{ K}$,\n$$\nT^{*}=298.15\\cdot\\frac{2}{1.22+1}=298.15\\cdot\\frac{2}{2.22}=298.15\\cdot\\frac{100}{111}=\\frac{29815}{111}\\approx 268.604.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the critical temperature is $269 \\text{ K}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{269}$$", "id": "1745279"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond calculating properties at a single point, we now explore a more general concept. The critical speed of sound, $a^*$, is not just the speed of sound at the throat; it is a constant reference velocity for a given isentropic flow that is directly related to the total enthalpy of the gas. This practice challenges you to derive a symbolic relationship for the ratio of the local fluid velocity, $V$, to this critical speed of sound, $a^*$, as a function of the local Mach number [@problem_id:1745259]. This ratio provides a powerful, non-dimensional way to characterize the flow's speed at any point relative to its total energy state.", "problem": "A Bunsen burner operates by feeding a combustible gas mixture up a tube before ignition.
