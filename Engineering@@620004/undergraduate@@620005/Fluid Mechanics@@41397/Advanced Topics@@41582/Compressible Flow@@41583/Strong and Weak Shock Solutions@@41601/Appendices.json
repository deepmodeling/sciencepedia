The upstream flow has a Mach number of $M_1 = 2.0$. The relationships governing the properties across the shock (the Rankine-Hugoniot relations) yield a unique physical solution for the downstream state. In this physical solution, the downstream flow becomes subsonic ($M_2  1$). This outcome is analogous to the \"strong solution\" concept in oblique shock theory.\n\nBased on this information, would Mach waves, generated by a tiny, stationary disturbance placed in the flow region downstream of the shock, be observable?
