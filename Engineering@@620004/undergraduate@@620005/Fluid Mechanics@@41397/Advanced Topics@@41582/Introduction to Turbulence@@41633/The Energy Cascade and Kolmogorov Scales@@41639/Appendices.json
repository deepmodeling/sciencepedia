At the largest scales, energy is injected into the flow, creating large eddies with a characteristic length scale $L$ and a characteristic velocity scale $U$. The turnover time for these large eddies, which represents the time it takes for a large eddy to rotate once, is given by $T_L = L/U$.\n\nThis energy is transferred down to smaller and smaller scales through a process called the energy cascade, until it reaches the smallest scales, known as the Kolmogorov scales, where it is dissipated into heat by viscous forces. The characteristic time for dissipation at these small scales is the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_\\eta$. The value of $\\tau_\\eta$ is determined by the fluid's kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$ (which has dimensions of length squared per time, $L^2 T^{-1}$), and the rate of energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$ (which has dimensions of length squared per time cubed, $L^2 T^{-3}$).\n\nFor a fully developed turbulent flow in a state of statistical equilibrium, the rate of energy dissipation $\\epsilon$ at the small scales is assumed to be equal to the rate of energy supply at the large scales.
