Before delving into complex calculations, a crucial first step is to identify which sources are physically possible in a given scenario. This exercise challenges you to apply fundamental physical principles to determine why the simplest source, the acoustic monopole (representing unsteady mass addition), is fundamentally absent in the common case of flow around a solid, non-porous object. [@problem_id:1733525]", "problem": "In the study of aeroacoustics, Lighthill's acoustic analogy is a powerful framework for understanding how fluid motion generates sound. It recasts the exact fluid dynamics equations into the form of an inhomogeneous wave equation. The source terms of this equation can be interpreted as a distribution of acoustic sources. The simplest type of acoustic source is the monopole, which represents an unsteady injection of mass into the fluid. The next orders are the dipole, associated with unsteady forces, and the quadrupole, associated with unsteady turbulent stresses.\n\nConsider the classic problem of sound generated by a low-Mach-number flow around a solid, rigid, non-porous body of arbitrary shape moving through an otherwise quiescent, unbounded fluid. According to Lighthill's theory, the leading-order acoustic source for this configuration is typically the dipole. Why can the monopole source contribution be considered fundamentally zero in this specific scenario?\n\nSelect the most accurate physical reason from the options below.\n\nA.

The monopole source corresponds physically to unsteady mass addition or removal from the fluid, i.e., a net volumetric mass source.\n\nStart from the continuity equation augmented with a volumetric mass source density $q_{m}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = q_{m}.\n$$\nIntegrate over the time-dependent fluid volume $V_{f}(t)$ exterior to the body and apply the Reynolds transport theorem for a control volume with moving boundaries:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{V_{f}(t)} \\rho \\, dV = -\\int_{S(t)} \\rho \\left(\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{V}_{s}\\right)\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, dS + \\int_{V_{f}(t)} q_{m}\\, dV,\n$$\nwhere $S(t)$ is the boundary of $V_{f}(t)$, $\\mathbf{V}_{s}$ is the local velocity of the boundary, and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward normal.\n\nDecompose $S(t)$ into the solid body surface $S_{b}(t)$ and a control surface at infinity $S_{\\infty}$.

In Lighthill’s framework, the monopole source strength is proportional to the net mass injection rate (or its acoustic equivalent, the time rate of change of fluid volume/mass in the control volume). Since the body is solid and non-porous, it cannot add or remove mass; it can only displace fluid without creating a net source or sink. Consequently, the monopole contribution is fundamentally zero in this configuration. The leading-order acoustic radiation is then associated with dipole sources due to unsteady surface forces (e.g., pressure loading), consistent with low-Mach-number external flows.\n\nHence, the most accurate reason is that the body cannot add or remove mass from the system, eliminating monopole sources.\n\nIncorrect alternatives, briefly:\n- A: Choice of inertial frame does not create or remove mass sources.\n- B: While unsteady forces generate dipoles, this does not explain why monopoles are zero.\n- C: Near-field incompressibility does not, by itself, eliminate monopoles; absence of mass injection does.\n- E: Streamlining affects magnitude but not the fundamental existence of monopole sources.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1733525"}, {"introduction": "Having established the types of acoustic sources, the next step is to quantify their strength.
