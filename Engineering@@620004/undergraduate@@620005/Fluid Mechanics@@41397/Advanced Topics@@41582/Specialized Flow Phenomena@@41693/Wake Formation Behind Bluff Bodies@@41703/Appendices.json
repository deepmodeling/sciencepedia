This vibration is caused by the periodic shedding of vortices from the cylindrical cable, a process known as a von Kármán vortex street.\n\nThe engineer hypothesizes that the frequency of vortex shedding, $f$, depends on a set of physical parameters: the speed of the wind, $U$; the diameter of the power line, $D$; the density of the air, $\\rho$; and the dynamic viscosity of the air, $\\mu$. From these five variables, it is possible to construct two independent dimensionless groups, $\\Pi_1$ and $\\Pi_2$, such that the physical relationship can be expressed in the form $\\Pi_1 = g(\\Pi_2)$, where $g$ is an unknown function.\n\nYour task is to determine the specific dimensionless group, which we will call $\\Pi_1$, that is directly proportional to the shedding frequency $f$.
