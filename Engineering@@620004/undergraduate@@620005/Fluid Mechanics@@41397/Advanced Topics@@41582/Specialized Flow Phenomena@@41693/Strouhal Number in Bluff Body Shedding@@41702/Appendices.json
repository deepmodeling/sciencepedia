The model is then tested in a wind tunnel.\n\nThe test is conducted under conditions of dynamic similarity, which for this type of flow requires that the Reynolds number of the flow past the model is equal to the Reynolds number of the wind expected to flow past the full-scale pillar.

This gives us the ratio of their characteristic lengths, $L$. A convenient characteristic length for a cylinder is its diameter.\n$$\n\\frac{L_m}{L_p} = \\frac{1}{100}\n$$\n\nThe problem also specifies that the test is run under conditions of dynamic similarity, which is achieved by matching the Reynolds number ($Re$) for the model and the prototype.\n$$\nRe_m = Re_p\n$$\n\nThe Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity defined as $Re = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$, where $U$ is the characteristic flow velocity, $L$ is the characteristic length, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.

The Strouhal number is defined as $St = \\frac{fL}{U}$, where $f$ is the vortex shedding frequency. For two flows to be dynamically similar (i.e., having the same Reynolds number and geometry), their corresponding dimensionless parameters must be equal.
