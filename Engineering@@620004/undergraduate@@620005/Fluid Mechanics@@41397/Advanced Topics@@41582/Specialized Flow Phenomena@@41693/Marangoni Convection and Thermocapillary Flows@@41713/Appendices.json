One method involves using surface tension gradients, a phenomenon known as the Marangoni effect. Consider a thin, circular film of a liquid mixture on a flat, horizontal substrate. The mixture consists of a non-volatile solvent and a volatile solute. The surface tension, $\\sigma$, of the liquid is sensitive to both temperature, $T$, and the dimensionless mass fraction of the solute, $c$.
