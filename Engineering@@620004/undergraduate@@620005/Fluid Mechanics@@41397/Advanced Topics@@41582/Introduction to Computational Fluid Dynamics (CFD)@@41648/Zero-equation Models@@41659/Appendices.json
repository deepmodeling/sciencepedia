The fundamental assumption of this model is that the characteristic size of a turbulent eddy, represented by the mixing length $l_m$, is limited by the proximity to solid boundaries.

This type of flow is known as channel flow. The bottom plate is stationary, while the top plate moves with a constant velocity $U_w$ in the positive $x$-direction. Additionally, a constant adverse pressure gradient is applied along the $x$-direction. This specific configuration is a form of turbulent Couette-Poiseuille flow.\n\nIn turbulent flows, the total shear stress is the sum of the viscous stress and the turbulent (or Reynolds) stress. The turbulent shear stress, $\\tau_t$, can be modeled using various approaches.

In reality, experimental measurements show that the turbulent shear stress is not zero at the point of zero mean velocity gradient. Turbulent eddies are transported from regions of high shear, carrying momentum and thus generating stress even in regions where the local mean gradient is zero.
