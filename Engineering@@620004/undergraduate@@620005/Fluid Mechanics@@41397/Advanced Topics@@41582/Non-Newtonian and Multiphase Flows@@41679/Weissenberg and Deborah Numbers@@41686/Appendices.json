This non-Newtonian fluid is known for its shear-thickening properties. The suspension has a characteristic material relaxation time of $\\tau_m = 0.15$ s, which represents the timescale over which the fluid's microstructure reorganizes after being disturbed.\n\nThe success of the demonstration hinges on whether the fluid behaves more like a solid or a liquid under the rapid impact of a person's foot. This behavior is governed by a dimensionless ratio comparing the material's relaxation time to the characteristic timescale of the applied stress. To estimate this process timescale, the student models the runner's foot strike. The runner's foot has a characteristic length of $L_f = 20$ cm, and it is estimated to strike the fluid with a characteristic vertical speed of $v_i = 2.0$ m/s. The characteristic time of this impact, $t_{p}$, can be approximated as the time it takes for the foot to displace a distance equal to its own characteristic length at the impact speed.
