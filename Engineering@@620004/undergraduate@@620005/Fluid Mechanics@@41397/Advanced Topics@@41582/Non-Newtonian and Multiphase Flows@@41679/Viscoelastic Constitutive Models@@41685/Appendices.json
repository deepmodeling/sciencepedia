At a constant strain, the dashpot element offers an infinitely increasing resistance over time, causing the stress to grow rather than relax.\n\nB. At a constant strain, the strain rate is zero. Consequently, the viscous dashpot contributes no stress, and the total stress remains constant, determined solely by the elastic spring.\n\nC. The model predicts that for a constant strain, all stress is instantaneously transferred from the spring to the dashpot, which is unable to dissipate it.\n\nD.
