A controlled temperature gradient is applied along the free surface of the liquid, causing the surface tension $\\sigma$ to vary linearly with position $x$ along the flow direction. The surface tension is described by the relation $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_0 - \\beta x$, where $\\sigma_0$ is the surface tension at $x=0$ and $\\beta$ is a positive constant representing the magnitude of the surface tension gradient.\n\nAssume the following conditions hold:\n1. The flow is steady, incompressible, and laminar.\n2. The flow is purely two-dimensional, with fluid velocity $u$ only in the $x$-direction (along the plate). The vertical coordinate is $z$, measured upwards from the plate where $z=0$.\n3. The length scale over which the flow properties change in the $x$-direction is much larger than the film thickness $h$.\n4. The flow is driven solely by the surface tension gradient (an effect known as the Marangoni effect). The effects of gravity and any pressure gradients along the $x$-direction are negligible.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the magnitude of the volumetric flow rate per unit width, $|Q|$, passing through a vertical cross-section of the liquid film.", "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the volumetric flow rate per unit width, $|Q|$, for a flow driven by a surface tension gradient in a thin liquid film. We start with the Navier-Stokes equation for the momentum in the $x$-direction for an incompressible, viscous fluid.\n\nThe $x$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation in Cartesian coordinates is:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $u, v, w$ are the velocity components in the $x, y, z$ directions, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem to simplify this equation:\n1.  **Steady flow**: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Two-dimensional flow**: $v=0$ and there is no variation in the $y$-direction, so $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = 0$.

Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\ll \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$, and we can neglect the $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ term. Furthermore, this approximation implies that the inertial terms on the left-hand side are negligible compared to the viscous terms (a low Reynolds number flow). So, the entire left-hand side can be set to zero.\n4.  **Negligible pressure gradient**: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n\nApplying all these simplifications, the momentum equation reduces to:\n$$\n0 = \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nSince the velocity $u$ depends only on the vertical coordinate $z$ (a consequence of the fully developed nature of this flow), we can write this as an ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{d z^2} = 0\n$$\n\nWe can solve this equation by integrating twice with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dz} = C_1\n$$\n$$\nu(z) = C_1 z + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  **No-slip at the bottom plate**: At the stationary plate ($z=0$), the fluid velocity must be zero.\n    $u(0) = 0 \\implies C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n    So, the velocity profile is $u(z) = C_1 z$.\n\n2.  **Stress balance at the free surface**: At the free surface ($z=h$), the shear stress within the fluid must balance the stress created by the surface tension gradient.\n    The shear stress in the fluid at the surface is $\\tau_{zx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dz}|_{z=h}$.\n    The stress due to the surface tension gradient is $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}$.\n    The balance requires $\\tau_{zx} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}$.\n    So, $\\mu \\frac{du}{dz}|_{z=h} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}$.\n\nFrom our first integration, we know that $\\frac{du}{dz} = C_1$.
