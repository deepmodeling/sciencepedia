The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nThe specific energy, $E$, of the flow at any cross-section is defined as the sum of the flow depth and the velocity head.

The channel has a triangular cross-section. The side slopes are given as $m$ horizontal to 1 vertical. This means for a flow depth of $y$, the horizontal distance from the center to the edge is $my$. The total top width of the water surface, $T$, is therefore $2my$.\nThe cross-sectional area $A$ of the triangular section is given by:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} T y = \\frac{1}{2} (2my) y = my^2$$\nNow, substitute this expression for the area $A$ back into the equation for specific energy $E$.

The relationship cannot be determined without performing a full gradually varied flow calculation.\nE. The relationship depends on the specific value of the bump height $\\Delta z$.", "solution": "We consider a wide, rectangular, steady, one-dimensional open-channel flow with discharge per unit width $q$ and depth $y$. For a wide channel, the mean velocity is $v = q/y$, the Froude number is\n$$\n\\mathrm{Fr}^{2} \\equiv \\frac{v^{2}}{g y} = \\frac{q^{2}}{g y^{3}},\n$$\nand the specific energy is\n$$\nE(y) = y + \\frac{q^{2}}{2 g y^{2}}.\n$$\nThe critical depth satisfies $Fr = 1$, hence\n$$\ny_{c} = \\left(\\frac{q^{2}}{g}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}.\n$$\nThe normal depth for wide channels under Manning’s equation is\n$$\ny_{n} = \\left(\\frac{n\\,q}{S_{0}^{1/2}}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{5}}.\n$$\n\nStep 1: Determine the flow regime near stations A and B in the absence of the bump. At station A, the given depth is $y_{A}$. The Froude number there is\n$$\n\\mathrm{Fr}_{A}^{2} = \\frac{q^{2}}{g\\,y_{A}^{3}}.\n$$\nThus $\\mathrm{Fr}_{A} > 1$ if and only if $y_{A}  y_{c}$. With the provided $q$, $g$, and $y_{A}$, one verifies $y_{A}  y_{c}$, hence $\\mathrm{Fr}_{A} > 1$ and the flow at A is supercritical. The corresponding normal depth is $y_{n} = \\left(\\frac{n q}{S_{0}^{1/2}}\\right)^{3/5}$. For the given $S_{0}$, $n$, and $q$, one finds $y_{n}  y_{c}$, so the bed slope is steep. On a steep slope, the supercritical normal depth $y_{n}$ is the attractor for supercritical flow. Over a modest downstream distance $L$ in a long, uniform channel, the flow remains supercritical (no control is introduced) and continues to adjust toward $y_{n}$. Therefore, at station B without the bump, the depth $y_{B}'$ is still supercritical, i.e., $Fr_{B} > 1$.\n\nStep 2: Effect of a smooth hump that does not induce a hydraulic jump. Introduce a local bed rise (a smooth hump) of height $\\Delta z$ centered at station B. Let $y_{B}$ denote the depth just at the upstream leading edge of the hump (i.e., immediately before the bed starts to rise). Across the hump, the total head per unit weight $H = z_{b} + E$ adjusts according to the local change in bed elevation and small frictional losses on the smooth profile. The key propagation principle for open-channel flow is that for supercritical flow ($Fr > 1$), disturbances and controls do not propagate upstream: the upstream state is not influenced by downstream geometry changes unless choking occurs (i.e., unless the crest tends to impose critical control or a hydraulic jump forms upstream).\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the hump is designed such that it does not induce a hydraulic jump upstream of its location. In supercritical approach flow, absence of choking and absence of a jump imply that the upstream conditions (including the depth just at the upstream leading edge) remain unaffected by the presence of the hump. Therefore, the depth immediately upstream of the leading edge with the hump, $y_{B}$, equals the depth at the same location without the hump, $y_{B}'$:\n$$\ny_{B} = y_{B}'.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Consistency with specific energy monotonicity. For completeness, note that in the supercritical branch ($y  y_{c}$), $dE/dy = 1 - \\frac{q^{2}}{g y^{3}} = 1 - \\mathrm{Fr}^{2}  0$, so locally reducing $E$ corresponds to increasing $y$ and vice versa, whereas in the subcritical branch ($y > y_{c}$), $dE/dy > 0$. However, because the approach at B is supercritical and the hump does not choke the flow, the upstream section at the leading edge does not adjust its depth relative to the no-hump case; the rapid adjustment occurs over the hump itself and downstream. Hence the equality above holds.\n\nConclusion: Under the provided conditions (supercritical approach and no upstream hydraulic jump), the presence or absence of the low-profile bump does not alter the depth just at the upstream leading edge of the bump, so $y_{B} = y_{B}'$.
