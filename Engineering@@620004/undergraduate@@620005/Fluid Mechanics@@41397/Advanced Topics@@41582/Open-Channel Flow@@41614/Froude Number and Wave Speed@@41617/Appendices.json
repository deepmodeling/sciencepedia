In many civil engineering applications, such as irrigation canals and river management, it's crucial to maintain a subcritical flow to prevent erosion and ensure stability. This practice puts you in the role of a design engineer tasked with modifying a channel to tame a fast, supercritical flow.

To reduce potential for erosion downstream, the engineer must modify the channel to make the flow subcritical, specifically targeting a new Froude number $Fr_2 = 0.6$. This transition is to be achieved by changing only the width of the channel from its initial value $b_1$ to a new value $b_2$. The volumetric flow rate $Q$ and the water depth $y$ are to be maintained constant throughout the modification.
