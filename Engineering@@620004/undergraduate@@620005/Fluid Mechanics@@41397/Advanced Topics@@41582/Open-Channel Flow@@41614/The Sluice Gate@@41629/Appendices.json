We will analyze the flow at two sections: section 1 far upstream of the gate where the depth is $y_1$, and section 2 just downstream of the gate where the depth is $y_2$, which corresponds to the height of the gate opening.\n\nFirst, we state the energy equation for an open channel flow between sections 1 and 2. The specific energy, $E$, at any cross-section is the sum of the potential energy head (depth) and the kinetic energy head. Assuming no energy loss due to friction as the flow passes under the gate, the specific energy is conserved:\n$E_1 = E_2$\n$$y_1 + \\frac{V_1^2}{2g} = y_2 + \\frac{V_2^2}{2g}$$\nHere, $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the average flow velocities at sections 1 and 2, respectively, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nNext, we use the continuity equation. For a rectangular channel of unit width, the discharge per unit width, $q$, is constant:\n$q = V_1 y_1 = V_2 y_2$\nFrom this, we can express the velocities in terms of the discharge and depth:\n$V_1 = \\frac{q}{y_1}$ and $V_2 = \\frac{q}{y_2}$.\n\nNow, substitute these expressions for $V_1$ and $V_2$ back into the energy equation:\n$$y_1 + \\frac{(q/y_1)^2}{2g} = y_2 + \\frac{(q/y_2)^2}{2g}$$\n$$y_1 + \\frac{q^2}{2gy_1^2} = y_2 + \\frac{q^2}{2gy_2^2}$$\nThe term on the left is the specific energy at the upstream section, $E_1$.

For a given specific energy, there can be up to three possible depths. One of these roots must be the original upstream depth, $y_1=3.00$ m, because it is a valid state with the calculated specific energy $E_1$. Let's verify that $y_2 = 3.00$ is a root:\n$(3.00)^3 - 3.09061(3.00)^2 + 0.81549 = 27.0 - 3.09061(9.00) + 0.81549 = 27.0 - 27.81549 + 0.81549 = 0$.\nSince $y_2=3.00$ is a root, $(y_2 - 3.00)$ must be a factor of the cubic polynomial. We can use polynomial division to find the other roots.

A negative depth is physically impossible. The two positive depths, $y_1=3.00$ m and $y_2=0.56864$ m, are known as alternate depths. The upstream flow is deep and slow (subcritical), while the flow passing under the sluice gate opening is forced to become shallow and fast (supercritical).
