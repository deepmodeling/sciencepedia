In subcritical flow, disturbances propagate upstream; thus the reservoir acts as the control, producing a backwater curve. On a mild slope ($y_{n}>y_{c}$), such downstream deep control produces an M1 profile, for which the depth everywhere along the profile satisfies\n$$\ny>y_{n}>y_{c}.\n$$\nTherefore, the correct qualitative relationship for the GVF profile under these conditions is that the flow depth exceeds the normal depth, which in turn exceeds the critical depth.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1742355"}, {"introduction": "Real-world channel systems are rarely uniform and often involve transitions between different flow regimes.

The channel bed consists of two long sections with different slopes. The upstream section has a \"steep\" slope, which transitions to a \"mild\" slope in the downstream section. For the purposes of this problem, these slopes are defined as follows:\n\n- A **steep slope** is one where the normal depth of flow, $y_n$, is less than the critical depth, $y_c$.\n- A **mild slope** is one where the normal depth of flow, $y_n$, is greater than the critical depth, $y_c$.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, a stable hydraulic jump is observed to form on the mild slope, located some distance downstream from the point where the slope changes.

A hydraulic jump requires supercritical flow upstream and subcritical flow downstream; therefore, immediately upstream of the jump the depth satisfies $y<y_{c}$. On the mild slope at the jump location we thus have $y<y_{c}<y_{n}$, which places the flow in Zone 3 for a mild slope, i.e., an $M3$ profile.\n\nThis is consistent with the gradually varied flow equation,\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{S_{0}-S_{f}}{1-Fr^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $Fr>1$ for supercritical flow upstream of the jump. On a mild slope with $y<y_{n}$, one has $S_{f}>S_{0}$, so $S_{0}-S_{f}<0$ and $1-Fr^{2}<0$, giving $\\frac{dy}{dx}>0$: the depth increases in the downstream direction toward the jump, which is the characteristic behavior of an $M3$ profile.
