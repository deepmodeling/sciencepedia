This practice problem delves into a key design consideration: the choice between a rectangular weir and a V-notch (or triangular) weir for accurately measuring low flow rates.

The choice is between a standard suppressed rectangular weir and a 90-degree V-notch weir.

This final exercise presents a scenario where the incoming flow is supercritical, a high-velocity state that complicates many standard measurement techniques. You will be asked to apply your knowledge of specific energy and hydraulic jumps to justify the choice between a weir and a venturi flume, demonstrating a deeper, principles-based understanding of how these devices interact with different flow regimes [@problem_id:1756769].", "problem": "A hydraulic engineer is tasked with installing a permanent flow measurement device in a long, wide, rectangular spillway channel. The flow in the channel is consistently supercritical, characterized by a depth $y_1$ and a Froude number $Fr_1 > 1$. Two options are being considered:\n\n1.  A standard sharp-crested weir of height $P$ installed across the channel.\n2.  A carefully designed venturi flume that narrows the channel width from $W$ to a minimum throat width of $W_{throat}$.\n\nThe goal is to achieve the most accurate and reliable discharge measurement. Based on the principles of open-channel flow and specific energy, which of the following statements provides the correct choice and the most accurate physical justification for it?\n\nA. The weir is superior because the hydraulic jump it induces guarantees a stable, subcritical flow upstream, which is necessary for accurate head measurement over the crest.\n\nB. The flume is superior because it can be designed to smoothly guide the supercritical flow to a critical state at the throat, allowing for a direct and reliable discharge calculation, whereas a weir would force an unpredictable, energy-dissipating hydraulic jump upstream.\n\nC. The weir is superior because it operates based on a larger, more easily measured head difference compared to the subtle depth changes in a flume, leading to lower measurement uncertainty, regardless of the upstream flow regime.\n\nD. The flume is superior because it causes significantly less overall head loss (energy loss) than a weir. Since discharge measurement accuracy is directly proportional to energy conservation, the flume is the better choice.\n\nE. Neither device is suitable. Supercritical flow contains too much kinetic energy to be measured accurately by any device that physically constricts the flow; a non-contact method like acoustic Doppler velocimetry is required.", "solution": "To determine the most suitable device, we must analyze the interaction of each device with the initial supercritical flow using the concept of specific energy. The specific energy, $E$, for a rectangular channel is the sum of the potential energy (depth) and kinetic energy per unit weight of the fluid. It is given by:\n$$E = y + \\frac{V^2}{2g}$$\nwhere $y$ is the flow depth, $V$ is the average flow velocity, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The discharge per unit width is $q = Q/W = yV$. Substituting $V = q/y$ into the specific energy equation gives:\n$$E = y + \\frac{q^2}{2gy^2}$$\nFor a constant discharge $q$, a plot of $E$ versus $y$ (the specific energy diagram) has two limbs. The upper limb corresponds to subcritical flow ($Fr  1$), where the depth is large and velocity is low. The lower limb corresponds to supercritical flow ($Fr  1$), where the depth is small and velocity is high. The initial flow state $(y_1, E_1)$ is on the lower limb of this curve.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each device:\n\n**Case 1: The Sharp-Crested Weir**\nA weir is a vertical obstruction of height $P$. For flow to pass over the weir, the total energy head upstream, relative to the channel bed, must be sufficient. The standard weir equation relies on measuring the head $H$ above the weir crest under subcritical approach conditions.\nThe initial specific energy of the supercritical flow is $E_1 = y_1 + V_1^2/(2g)$. To clear the weir of height $P$, the specific energy relative to the weir crest must be positive. More importantly, the presence of the weir as a \"dam\" forces the upstream water level to rise. In a supercritical flow, an increase in depth cannot occur smoothly against an obstruction. Instead, the flow must undergo a hydraulic jump to transition to the subcritical regime.\nA hydraulic jump is a highly turbulent and irreversible process where the flow depth abruptly increases from a supercritical depth $y_1$ to a subcritical depth $y_2$. During this jump, a significant amount of mechanical energy is dissipated as heat and sound. Therefore, the specific energy after the jump, $E_2$, is considerably less than the specific energy before the jump, $E_1$.\nThe standard weir discharge formulas (e.g., $Q \\propto H^{3/2}$) are derived assuming a quiescent, subcritical approach flow where the energy head is well-defined and conserved. The presence of an upstream hydraulic jump, with its associated unpredictable energy loss, invalidates this fundamental assumption. Measuring the head $H$ above the weir crest in the turbulent, post-jump flow would lead to large inaccuracies in the calculated discharge. Therefore, a weir is not a reliable device for measuring an initially supercritical flow.\n\n**Case 2: The Venturi Flume**\nA venturi flume works by constricting the flow, in this case, by narrowing the channel width from $W$ to $W_{throat}$. This forces the flow to pass through a state of minimum specific energy, which is the critical flow condition ($Fr = 1$).\nFor a given discharge $Q$, the specific energy required to pass the flow through the throat is minimized when the flow is critical at the throat. Let's analyze the transition from the initial supercritical state. As the channel begins to narrow, the discharge per unit width $q = Q/W(x)$ increases. On the specific energy diagram for a constant total discharge $Q$, this constriction causes the flow state to move along a path of increasing specific energy. For an initial supercritical flow (on the lower limb of the $E-y$ curve), an increase in specific energy corresponds to an *increase* in depth, moving the state point up along the lower limb towards the critical depth point.\nIf the flume is designed correctly (with smooth and gradual contractions), this transition from supercritical toward critical can occur smoothly, without the violent energy dissipation of a hydraulic jump. At the throat, the flow is \"choked\" and passes through the critical depth, $y_c$. At this point, the discharge $Q$ is uniquely related to the critical depth by the equation:\n$$Q = A_c V_c = (W_{throat} y_c) \\sqrt{g y_c} = W_{throat} \\sqrt{g} y_c^{3/2}$$\nBy measuring the critical depth $y_c$ in the throat, one can accurately calculate the discharge $Q$. This principle is robust because it relies on forcing the flow through a well-defined physical state (critical flow) in a controlled manner that can avoid the large, unpredictable energy losses of a hydraulic jump.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n- A: Incorrect. The hydraulic jump is a problem, not a solution. It is highly turbulent and dissipative, making accurate head measurement impossible.\n- B: Correct. This statement accurately describes the physics. A flume smoothly transitions the flow to a measurable critical state, while a weir forces a dissipative jump that corrupts the measurement.\n- C: Incorrect. While the head over a weir may be large, the measurement is rendered inaccurate by the upstream jump. The premise is flawed.\n- D: Incorrect. While the flume is more energy-efficient, the primary reason for its superior *accuracy* in this context is its ability to avoid the hydraulic jump, not simply because it has lower head loss. The justification is about the *principle of measurement* being valid, which is compromised by the jump.\n- E: Incorrect. While non-contact methods exist, it is false that constrictive devices cannot measure supercritical flow. A properly designed flume is a classic and effective tool for this exact purpose.\n\nTherefore, the flume is the superior device because it provides a reliable measurement principle compatible with supercritical approach flow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1756769"}]}
