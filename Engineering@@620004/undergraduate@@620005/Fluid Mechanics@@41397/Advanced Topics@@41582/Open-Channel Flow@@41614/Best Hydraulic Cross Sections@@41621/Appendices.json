For a rectangular channel with bottom width $b_1$ and flow depth $y_1$, the cross-sectional area $A$ and wetted perimeter $P_1$ are given by:\n$$A = b_1 y_1$$\n$$P_1 = b_1 + 2y_1$$\nThe problem states that for Design 1, the aspect ratio is $y_1/b_1 = 0.25$, which means $y_1 = 0.25 b_1$. We can substitute this into the area equation to express the dimensions in terms of $A$.\n$$A = b_1 (0.25 b_1) = 0.25 b_1^{2}$$\nSolving for $b_1$:\n$$b_1^{2} = 4A \\implies b_1 = \\sqrt{4A} = 2\\sqrt{A}$$\nNow we can find the depth $y_1$:\n$$y_1 = 0.25 b_1 = 0.25 (2\\sqrt{A}) = 0.5\\sqrt{A}$$\nWith the dimensions $b_1$ and $y_1$ expressed in terms of $A$, we can find the wetted perimeter $P_1$:\n$$P_1 = b_1 + 2y_1 = 2\\sqrt{A} + 2(0.5\\sqrt{A}) = 2\\sqrt{A} + \\sqrt{A} = 3\\sqrt{A}$$\n\nNext, let's analyze Design 2, the best hydraulic section.

The area and perimeter are:\n$$A = b_2 y_2$$\n$$P_2 = b_2 + 2y_2$$\nTo find the condition for the minimum perimeter for a fixed area $A$, we first express $P_2$ as a function of a single variable, for instance, $y_2$. From the area equation, $b_2 = A/y_2$. Substituting this into the perimeter equation:\n$$P_2(y_2) = \\frac{A}{y_2} + 2y_2$$\nTo find the minimum perimeter, we take the derivative of $P_2$ with respect to $y_2$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dP_2}{dy_2} = -\\frac{A}{y_2^{2}} + 2$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$-\\frac{A}{y_2^{2}} + 2 = 0 \\implies 2 = \\frac{A}{y_2^{2}} \\implies A = 2y_2^{2}$$\nThis is the condition on the area and depth for the best hydraulic section.

Since $A = b_2 y_2$, we have:\n$$b_2 y_2 = 2y_2^{2} \\implies b_2 = 2y_2$$\nSo, the best hydraulic rectangular section has a width that is twice its depth.
