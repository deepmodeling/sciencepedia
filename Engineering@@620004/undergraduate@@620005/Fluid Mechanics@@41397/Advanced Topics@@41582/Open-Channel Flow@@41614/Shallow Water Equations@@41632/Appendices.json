The flow is assumed to be steady and uniform. A key parameter in open-channel flow is the specific discharge, denoted by $q$, which represents the volume flow rate per unit width of the channel. For a given specific discharge $q$, the flow can occur at various depths $h$. The engineer is particularly interested in the total energy of the flow per unit weight, which is the sum of the potential energy head (the water depth $h$) and the kinetic energy head (which depends on the flow velocity $v$). The flow velocity $v$ is related to the specific discharge $q$ and the depth $h$. There exists a unique depth, known as the critical depth $h_c$, at which this total energy per unit weight is minimized for a fixed specific discharge $q$. This condition is fundamental for designing efficient transitions and flow measurement devices.\n\nDerive an expression for the critical depth $h_c$ in terms of the specific discharge $q$ and the acceleration due to gravity $g$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the depth $h_c$ at which the total energy per unit weight is minimized for a given specific discharge $q$.\n\nFirst, let's write down the expression for the total energy per unit weight, which is commonly known as the specific energy, $E$.

For a rectangular channel, the flow rate $Q$ is the product of the cross-sectional area $A$ and the velocity $v$. The area for a flow of depth $h$ in a channel of width $b$ is $A = bh$. The specific discharge is $q = Q/b$. Therefore, we can relate $q$ to the velocity $v$ and depth $h$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{Q}{b} = \\frac{Av}{b} = \\frac{(bh)v}{b} = hv\n$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the velocity $v$ in terms of $q$ and $h$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{q}{h}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $v$ into the equation for the specific energy $E$.
