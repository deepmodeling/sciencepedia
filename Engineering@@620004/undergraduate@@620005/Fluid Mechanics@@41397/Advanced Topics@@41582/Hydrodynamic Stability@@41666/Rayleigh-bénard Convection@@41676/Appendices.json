This final practice serves as a crucial conceptual test, pushing you to think beyond this simple scenario and focus on the fundamental physical principle: gravitational instability. By analyzing a hypothetical fluid that behaves contrary to common liquids — it becomes denser upon heating — you will deduce the true condition required to trigger convection, cementing your understanding of the interplay between temperature, density, and gravity [@problem_id:1784701].", "problem": "In the study of fluid dynamics, Rayleigh-Bénard convection describes the phenomenon where a fluid, when heated from below, develops a characteristic pattern of convection cells. This process is fundamentally driven by a density gradient established by a temperature gradient in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nConsider a thin, horizontal layer of a special incompressible fluid confined between two large, parallel plates separated by a small distance. The fluid is subject to a uniform gravitational field pointing vertically downward. The coefficient of volume thermal expansion, $\\alpha$, is defined by the relation $\\rho \\approx \\rho_0 [1 - \\alpha(T - T_0)]$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density at temperature $T$, and $\\rho_0$ is the reference density at a reference temperature $T_0$. For most common fluids, $\\alpha$ is positive, meaning they become less dense when heated.\n\nHowever, the specific fluid in this problem exhibits an anomalous behavior: its coefficient of volume thermal expansion $\\alpha$ is a negative constant over the entire range of temperatures considered.\n\nTo induce Rayleigh-Bénard convection in this specific fluid layer, which of the following heating configurations is required?\n\nA. The bottom plate must be maintained at a higher temperature than the top plate. This is because heating a fluid always decreases its density, causing it to rise.\n\nB. The top plate must be maintained at a higher temperature than the bottom plate. This is because denser fluid must be situated above less dense fluid for a gravitational instability to occur.\n\nC. It is impossible to induce convection in such a fluid, as a negative coefficient of thermal expansion inherently stabilizes the fluid against temperature gradients.\n\nD. The bottom plate must be maintained at a higher temperature than the top plate, but only if the gravitational field is sufficiently weak.\n\nE. The heating configuration is irrelevant; convection will occur spontaneously as long as there is any temperature difference between the plates.", "solution": "Let $z$ be the vertical coordinate increasing upward, with gravitational acceleration $\\mathbf{g}=-g\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $g>0$.

Equivalently, for $\\alpha<0$ warm fluid is denser and tends to sink, while cooler fluid is less dense and tends to rise.\n\nThe static stability of a vertically stratified state is determined by the vertical density gradient.

The instability condition becomes\n$$\n\\alpha\\,(T_{t}-T_{b})<0.\n$$\nWith $\\alpha<0$, this inequality requires $T_{t}-T_{b}>0$, i.e., $T_{t}>T_{b}$: the top must be hotter than the bottom so that the denser (hotter) fluid lies above the less dense (cooler) fluid, creating a gravitationally unstable stratification.\n\nThis conclusion also follows from the Rayleigh number for a horizontal layer,\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ra}=\\frac{g\\,\\alpha\\,(T_{b}-T_{t})\\,H^{3}}{\\nu\\,\\kappa},\n$$\nfor which linear instability requires $\\mathrm{Ra}>\\mathrm{Ra}_{c}>0$.
