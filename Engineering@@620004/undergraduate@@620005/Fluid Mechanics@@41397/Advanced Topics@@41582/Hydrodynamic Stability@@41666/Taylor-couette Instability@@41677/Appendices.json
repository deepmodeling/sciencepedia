The flow can transition from a simple laminar state to a more complex state containing Taylor vortices.\n\nThe onset of this centrifugal instability is primarily governed by a condition first identified by Lord Rayleigh for inviscid fluids. The Rayleigh criterion suggests that the flow is susceptible to instability if the square of the specific angular momentum decreases with the radial distance from the axis of rotation.

This practice [@problem_id:1796820] challenges you to consider the effects of a more realistic, finite-length system with stationary endplates. You will explore how these no-slip boundary conditions create a force imbalance that drives a large-scale secondary circulation, a phenomenon known as Ekman pumping, which exists even at speeds below the critical threshold for Taylor vortices.", "problem": "Consider the classic Taylor-Couette flow setup, which consists of a viscous, incompressible fluid confined in the annular gap between two long, concentric cylinders. The inner cylinder has a radius $R_i$ and rotates with a constant angular velocity $\\Omega_i$, while the outer cylinder has a radius $R_o$ and is held stationary ($\\Omega_o = 0$).\n\nIn the idealized theoretical model, the cylinders are assumed to be infinitely long. In this case, for low rotation speeds, the fluid establishes a stable, purely circumferential (azimuthal) velocity profile known as circular Couette flow. As the angular velocity $\\Omega_i$ is increased beyond a certain critical value, this primary flow becomes unstable and transitions to a more complex state characterized by a stack of counter-rotating toroidal vortices, known as Taylor vortices.\n\nNow, consider a more realistic experimental setup where the cylinders have a finite length $L$. The annular gap is sealed at the top and bottom by stationary, flat endplates attached to the stationary outer cylinder. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary qualitative effect these stationary endplates have on the fluid's base flow, even at angular velocities well below the critical threshold for the formation of Taylor vortices?\n\nA. The endplates completely suppress the formation of any vortical structures, ensuring the flow remains purely azimuthal at all rotation speeds up to the onset of turbulence.\n\nB. The endplates induce a large-scale secondary circulation, with fluid moving radially inward toward the inner cylinder near the endplates and axially along the rotating inner cylinder toward the mid-plane.\n\nC. The primary effect of the endplates is to cause the fluid's effective viscosity to increase near the ends, thus requiring a significantly higher angular velocity to drive the flow.\n\nD. The endplates force the azimuthal velocity of the fluid to be constant across the radial gap ($R_i < r < R_o$) at all heights, simplifying the base flow profile.\n\nE. The endplates have no significant effect on the bulk flow dynamics, as their influence is strictly confined to a negligible boundary layer thickness that is much smaller than the cylinder length $L$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary qualitative effect of stationary endplates on the Taylor-Couette flow at subcritical rotation speeds. Let's analyze the physics step by step.\n\nStep 1: The Ideal Base Flow (Infinite Cylinders)\nIn the idealized case of infinite cylinders, the stable base flow is purely azimuthal. The velocity is only a function of the radial position, $ \\vec{v} = v_{\\theta}(r) \\hat{\\theta} $. In this flow, there is a radial pressure gradient that balances the centrifugal force exerted on the fluid particles:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\rho \\frac{v_{\\theta}^{2}(r)}{r} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density. This pressure gradient is established throughout the fluid.\n\nStep 2: Introducing Finite Length and Stationary Endplates\nIn a finite-length apparatus, we have stationary endplates at, for example, $z=0$ and $z=L$. The no-slip boundary condition requires that the fluid velocity is zero at these solid surfaces. This means that at the endplates, the azimuthal velocity $v_{\\theta}$ must be zero.\n\nStep 3: The Boundary Layer Conflict\nConsider the fluid in a thin boundary layer near one of the endplates (e.g., near $z=0$). Due to the no-slip condition, the azimuthal velocity $v_{\\theta}$ decreases rapidly from its value in the bulk flow to zero at the plate. Consequently, within this boundary layer, the centrifugal force term $\\rho v_{\\theta}^{2}/r$ becomes much smaller than it is in the bulk of the fluid away from the endplates.\n\nStep 4: Force Imbalance\nThe radial pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}$, however, is largely determined by the dynamics of the bulk flow and does not decrease to zero within this thin endplate boundary layer. Therefore, near the endplates, the outwardly directed centrifugal force is no longer strong enough to balance the inwardly directed pressure force (since the pressure generally decreases with radius to balance the bulk centrifugal force). This creates a net inward force on the fluid particles within the endplate boundary layers.\n\nStep 5: The Secondary Flow\nThis net inward radial force drives the fluid to flow from the outer cylinder towards the inner cylinder along the top and bottom endplates. This is a radial component of velocity, $v_r < 0$, that is not present in the ideal infinite-cylinder case.\n\nStep 6: Mass Conservation and Circulation\nBy the principle of mass conservation (continuity), this inward flow of mass near the endplates must be balanced by an outward flow elsewhere. This outward flow ($v_r > 0$) occurs in the region away from the endplates, typically around the mid-plane of the apparatus ($z \\approx L/2$). To connect these regions of inward and outward radial flow, there must be an axial flow component, $v_z$. The fluid that moves radially inward near the endplates is then forced to move axially along the cylinders. Specifically, it flows away from the endplates and towards the mid-plane, primarily along the surface of the fast-rotating inner cylinder. The circuit is completed by a slow axial drift toward the endplates near the stationary outer cylinder. This organized fluid motion — radially inward at the ends, axially toward the middle, radially outward at the middle, and axially toward the ends — constitutes a large-scale secondary circulation, often called Ekman pumping. This circulation is superimposed on the primary azimuthal flow and exists even at the lowest rotation speeds.\n\nStep 7: Evaluating the Options\nA. This is incorrect. The endplates modify the stability boundary and the structure of the resulting Taylor vortices, but they do not suppress instability entirely.\nB. This statement accurately describes the secondary circulation (Ekman pumping) described above. The force imbalance near the endplates drives a radial flow inward, which in turn drives an axial flow toward the mid-plane along the inner cylinder. This is the correct answer.\nC. This is incorrect. The endplates are a geometric constraint that imposes a boundary condition; they do not alter the intrinsic properties of the fluid, such as viscosity.\nD. This is incorrect. The no-slip condition at the inner and outer cylinder walls ensures that $v_{\\theta}$ varies with radius $r$. The endplates add a dependence on the axial coordinate $z$ but do not make the radial profile uniform.\nE. This is incorrect. While the force imbalance originates in the thin endplate boundary layers, the resulting secondary circulation is a large-scale phenomenon that affects the entire volume of fluid in the gap, not just a negligible layer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1796820"}]}
