A deep insight from linear stability theory is that the shape of the mean velocity profile, $U(y)$, is a primary indicator of a flow’s susceptibility to instability. This practice will guide you in applying Rayleigh's famous inflection-point criterion, a cornerstone of hydrodynamic stability, to determine why some flows are inherently stable to small disturbances, providing a foundational understanding of what allows an instability like a Tollmien-Schlichting wave to even be considered in the first place [@problem_id:1806722].", "problem": "In the study of fluid mechanics, the transition from smooth, layered (laminar) flow to chaotic, swirling (turbulent) flow is a phenomenon of great importance. Linear stability theory provides a mathematical framework for predicting the onset of this transition by analyzing the growth of infinitesimal disturbances in a base flow. For many boundary layer flows, this transition is initiated by the amplification of specific wave-like disturbances known as Tollmien-Schlichting waves. A key insight from this theory, often summarized by Rayleigh's and Fjørtoft's criteria, links the stability of a flow to the shape of its velocity profile.\n\nConsider a fully developed, incompressible, viscous flow in a cylindrical pipe of radius $R$. The fluid velocity is purely in the axial direction and varies only with the radial position $r$ from the centerline. Two possible velocity profiles, $U(r)$, are proposed:\n\n**Profile A (Hagen-Poiseuille Flow):**\n$$U_A(r) = V_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)$$\n\n**Profile B (A Modified 'Blunter' Flow):**\n$$U_B(r) = V_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)^2$$\n\nHere, $V_0$ is the maximum velocity at the centerline ($r=0$) for both profiles, and the flow is defined for the domain $0 \\le r \\le R$.\n\nBased on an analysis of the shapes of these velocity profiles, specifically the presence or absence of inflection points (locations where the second spatial derivative of the velocity profile is zero), which of the following statements correctly identifies the profile predicted to be stable to all infinitesimal disturbances according to linear stability theory, and provides the correct reason?\n\nA. Profile A is stable because it has an inflection point at the centerline, $r=0$.\n\nB. Profile B is stable because it has no inflection points within the flow domain $0 < r < R$.\n\nC. Profile A is stable because it has no inflection points within the flow domain $0 < r < R$.\n\nD. Profile B is stable because it has an inflection point at $r = R/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nE. Both profiles are inherently unstable because all shear flows are susceptible to Tollmien-Schlichting waves.", "solution": "We are asked to use the presence or absence of inflection points in the axial velocity profiles to infer stability under linear (inviscid) theory, guided by Rayleigh’s inflection-point theorem (and Fjørtoft’s refinement). Rayleigh’s theorem states that a necessary condition for inviscid instability of a parallel shear flow is the existence of an inflection point in the base velocity profile within the flow domain. Therefore, a profile with no inflection points in the domain is predicted (by this criterion) to be stable to all infinitesimal disturbances.\n\nCompute the second derivatives to locate inflection points.\n\nFor Profile A:\n$$U_{A}(r)=V_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}}\\right),$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U_{A}}{\\mathrm{d}r}=-\\frac{2V_{0}}{R^{2}}\\,r,\\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U_{A}}{\\mathrm{d}r^{2}}=-\\frac{2V_{0}}{R^{2}}.$$\nThe second derivative is a constant, strictly negative for all $0\\le r\\le R$, hence it never vanishes in $0<r<R$.

Hence Profile B has an inflection point within the domain.\n\nBy Rayleigh’s inflection-point theorem, the absence of an inflection point is a necessary condition for inviscid stability. Therefore, Profile A is predicted to be stable to all infinitesimal disturbances on this basis, while Profile B is not excluded from instability due to the presence of an inflection point.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that Profile A is stable because it has no inflection points within $0<r<R$, which corresponds to option C. Options A and D incorrectly ascribe inflection-point properties and reasons for stability, B is false because Profile B does have an inflection point, and E is false because not all shear flows are linearly unstable (pipe Poiseuille flow is a canonical counterexample).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1806722"}, {"introduction": "Once a flow is identified as potentially unstable, the next question is: what is the physical mechanism driving the growth of disturbances? The transition to turbulence can be initiated by fundamentally different processes, the two most common being inviscid inflectional instability and viscous Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) instability. This exercise challenges you to precisely distinguish between these two pathways, focusing on the crucial roles of viscosity, the Reynolds number, and the velocity profile shape [@problem_id:1806752]. Mastering these distinctions is key to understanding the specific physical environment where T-S waves emerge.", "problem": "The transition from a smooth, laminar boundary layer to a chaotic, turbulent one is a critical process in many engineering applications. This transition is often initiated by the amplification of small disturbances within the flow. Two of the most fundamental mechanisms for this amplification are the viscous Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) instability and the inviscid inflectional instability. A fluid dynamics student is trying to summarize the key distinctions between these two phenomena.\n\nConsider the following statements comparing TS instability and inviscid inflectional instability. Identify all statements that are factually correct.\n\nA. Tollmien-Schlichting instability is fundamentally a viscous phenomenon, whereas inviscid inflectional instability can occur in the complete absence of viscous effects.\n\nB. A necessary condition for inviscid inflectional instability is the presence of an inflection point in the mean velocity profile. In contrast, Tollmien-Schlichting instability is known to occur in profiles without an inflection point, such as the Blasius boundary layer profile over a flat plate.\n\nC. Both types of instabilities are driven primarily by centrifugal forces created by streamline curvature and are therefore only relevant for flows over concave or convex surfaces.\n\nD. In Tollmien-Schlichting instability, the disturbance grows by extracting energy from the mean flow via the action of Reynolds stresses, a process enabled by a viscosity-induced phase shift between velocity disturbance components. In contrast, inflectional instability is driven by the dynamic rearrangement of mean flow vorticity by the disturbance velocity field.\n\nE. An inflection point in the velocity profile is a sufficient condition for Tollmien-Schlichting instability to occur but is not required for inviscid inflectional instability.\n\nF. Inviscid inflectional instability is, in principle, independent of the Reynolds number (as long as it is large), while Tollmien-Schlichting instability only leads to disturbance growth above a certain finite, critical Reynolds number.", "solution": "We compare the two amplification mechanisms using the governing linear stability equations, necessary conditions, and energy pathways.\n\nFor two-dimensional, incompressible, parallel shear flow with base velocity $U(y)$, temporal linear stability of viscous disturbances with streamfunction eigenfunction $\\phi(y)$ and complex phase speed $c$ and streamwise wavenumber $\\alpha$ is governed by the Orr–Sommerfeld equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{i \\alpha Re}\\left(D^{2}-\\alpha^{2}\\right)^{2}\\phi + \\left(U-c\\right)\\left(\\phi''-\\alpha^{2}\\phi\\right) - U'' \\phi = 0,\n$$\nwhere $D \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y}$ and $Re$ is the Reynolds number. In the inviscid limit, the viscous term proportional to $Re^{-1}$ vanishes and the equation reduces to the Rayleigh equation:\n$$\n\\left(U-c\\right)\\left(\\phi''-\\alpha^{2}\\phi\\right) - U'' \\phi = 0.\n$$\nRayleigh’s inflection point theorem gives a necessary condition for inviscid instability: the base profile must possess an inflection point, i.e., there must exist $y^{\\ast}$ with $U''(y^{\\ast})=0$ and a sign change of $U''$ across $y^{\\ast}$. Therefore, inviscid inflectional instability can exist without viscosity provided an inflection point is present; equivalently, in the absence of viscosity, profiles with no inflection point are stable to two-dimensional disturbances.\n\nTollmien–Schlichting (TS) instability is fundamentally viscous because it disappears when the $Re^{-1}$ term is removed; TS waves are supported in flows without an inflection point (e.g., the Blasius boundary layer) once $Re$ exceeds a finite critical value. Hence:\n- Statement A is correct: TS is viscous in origin; inviscid inflectional instability exists without viscosity.\n- Statement B is correct: an inflection point is a necessary condition for inviscid instability (Rayleigh criterion), while TS occurs in non-inflectional profiles such as the Blasius profile.\n\nThe energy budget of perturbations (Reynolds–Orr equation) for parallel shear flow may be written schematically as\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t} = - \\int u' v' U' \\,\\mathrm{d}V - \\epsilon,\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the perturbation kinetic energy, $u'$ and $v'$ are disturbance velocities, $U'=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}y}$, and $\\epsilon$ is the viscous dissipation. Growth requires the production term $- \\int u' v' U' \\,\\mathrm{d}V$ to be positive. For TS waves in non-inflectional boundary layers, viscosity creates a phase shift between $u'$ and $v'$ that renders $-u'v' U'$ positive despite the stabilizing effect of viscosity, overcoming dissipation only above a critical $Re$. For inviscid inflectional (Kelvin–Helmholtz–type) instability, the mechanism is the inviscid rearrangement of mean vorticity by the disturbance velocity field associated with $U''$, producing a favorable $-u'v'$ without requiring viscous phase shifts. Hence:\n- Statement D is correct: TS energy extraction relies on a viscosity-induced phase shift producing Reynolds stress work; inflectional instability is driven by inviscid vorticity dynamics.\n\nCentrifugal mechanisms arise from streamline curvature and are characteristic of Görtler or Taylor–Couette instabilities. TS and planar inflectional (Kelvin–Helmholtz) instabilities occur in rectilinear shear without curvature; therefore:\n- Statement C is incorrect.\n\nRegarding sufficiency and Reynolds-number dependence:\n- An inflection point is not a sufficient condition for TS instability, and, moreover, inviscid inflectional instability does require an inflection point as a necessary condition. Thus E is incorrect.\n- The inviscid problem has no explicit $Re$ and, for high $Re$, inviscid inflectional modes persist with only small viscous corrections, while TS instability requires exceeding a finite critical Reynolds number (e.g., for Blasius). Therefore F is correct.\n\nCollecting the correct statements yields A, B, D, and F.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "1806752"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conditions under which Tollmien-Schlichting waves can form, we now turn to describing them mathematically.
