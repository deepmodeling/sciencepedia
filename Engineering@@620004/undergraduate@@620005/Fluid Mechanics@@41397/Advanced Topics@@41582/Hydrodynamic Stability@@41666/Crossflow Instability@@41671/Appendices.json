Since the problem states that $U_e$ and $V_e$ are positive, this vector has a positive $x$-component and a negative $y$-component. The problem defines the positive $y$-direction as towards the wing tip, so a negative $y$-component indicates a direction towards the wing root.\n\nThus, the maximum crossflow magnitude is $\\frac{U_e V_e}{4 \\sqrt{U_e^2+V_e^2}}$ and its direction is towards the wing root.
