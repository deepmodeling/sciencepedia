The experiment consists of two large, parallel plates separated by a distance $H$. The space between the plates is filled with a Newtonian fluid of constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. The bottom plate, at position $y=0$, is coated with the new material and remains stationary. The top plate, at $y=H$, is uncoated and is dragged parallel to the bottom plate at a constant velocity $U$.\n\nThe flow is steady, laminar, and can be considered one-dimensional. The interaction of the fluid with the superhydrophobic surface is described by the Navier slip boundary condition, which states that the fluid velocity $u$ at the surface is proportional to the shear rate at that surface. For the stationary bottom plate, this condition is expressed as $u(y=0) = L_s \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$, where $L_s$ is the slip length, a characteristic property of the surface. A standard no-slip condition, $u=0$, applies at all other solid surfaces, such as the uncoated top plate if it were stationary.\n\nIn the experiment, the force per unit area required to maintain the top plate's velocity is measured. The result shows that this force is 10% less than the force that would be required if the bottom plate were also a standard, uncoated surface (i.e., if it enforced a no-slip condition).\n\nBased on this experimental finding, determine an expression for the slip length $L_s$ in terms of the plate separation $H$.", "solution": "The flow is steady, laminar, and one-dimensional between parallel plates with no imposed pressure gradient.
