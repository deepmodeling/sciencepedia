In many real-world scenarios, a force is applied to a fluid via a piston, and we need to understand how the fluid's properties change as a result. This exercise challenges you to connect the external force applied to a piston with the resulting change in the fluid's density, using the bulk modulus as the critical link between pressure and compression [@problem_id:1743325]. This is a key step in designing and analyzing high-pressure hydraulic systems.", "problem": "A crucial component in a next-generation robotic arm is a high-precision hydraulic actuator. The actuator consists of a rigid cylindrical chamber of fixed length, completely filled with a specialized, slightly compressible hydraulic fluid. One end of the chamber is sealed by a circular piston. Initially, the fluid has a uniform density $\\rho_0$ and is at ambient pressure. To actuate the arm, a constant external force $F$ is applied perpendicularly to the face of the piston, which has a diameter $D$. This force increases the pressure within the fluid, causing its density to increase. The resistance of the fluid to this compression is characterized by its bulk modulus of elasticity, a constant denoted by $K$.\n\nAssuming the cylinder itself does not deform, determine the fractional increase in the fluid's density, expressed as the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}$, where $\\Delta \\rho$ is the change in density. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $F$, $D$, and $K$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fractional increase in the fluid's density, $\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}$.\n\nFirst, we relate the applied force $F$ to the change in pressure $\\Delta P$ inside the hydraulic fluid. The force is applied over the circular area of the piston. The area $A$ of the piston is given by:\n$$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$$\nThe increase in pressure $\\Delta P$ is the applied force per unit area:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{F}{A} = \\frac{F}{\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}} = \\frac{4F}{\\pi D^2}$$\nNext, we use the definition of the bulk modulus of elasticity, $K$. The bulk modulus relates the change in pressure to the fractional change in volume. It is defined as:\n$$K = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0}}$$\nwhere $V_0$ is the initial volume of the fluid and $\\Delta V$ is the change in volume. The negative sign indicates that an increase in pressure ($\\Delta P > 0$) causes a decrease in volume ($\\Delta V  0$).\n\nWe need to relate the fractional change in volume, $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0}$, to the fractional change in density, $\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}$. The total mass $m$ of the fluid in the cylinder remains constant during the compression. The mass is the product of density $\\rho$ and volume $V$.\nSo, for the initial and final states:\n$$m = \\rho_0 V_0 = \\rho_f V_f$$\nwhere $\\rho_f$ and $V_f$ are the final density and volume, respectively. We can write $\\rho_f = \\rho_0 + \\Delta \\rho$ and $V_f = V_0 + \\Delta V$. Substituting these into the mass conservation equation:\n$$\\rho_0 V_0 = (\\rho_0 + \\Delta \\rho)(V_0 + \\Delta V)$$\nExpanding the right side gives:\n$$\\rho_0 V_0 = \\rho_0 V_0 + \\rho_0 \\Delta V + V_0 \\Delta \\rho + \\Delta \\rho \\Delta V$$\nSubtracting $\\rho_0 V_0$ from both sides:\n$$0 = \\rho_0 \\Delta V + V_0 \\Delta \\rho + \\Delta \\rho \\Delta V$$\nSince the fluid is only slightly compressible, the changes $\\Delta \\rho$ and $\\Delta V$ are small. Therefore, their product $\\Delta \\rho \\Delta V$ is a second-order small term and can be neglected in comparison to the other terms. This gives the approximation:\n$$0 \\approx \\rho_0 \\Delta V + V_0 \\Delta \\rho$$\nRearranging this equation to find the relationship between the fractional changes:\n$$\\rho_0 \\Delta V \\approx -V_0 \\Delta \\rho$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}$$\nThis important result shows that the fractional decrease in volume is equal to the fractional increase in density.\n\nNow we can substitute this relationship back into the definition of the bulk modulus:\n$$K = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0}} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{-\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}}$$\nWe are asked to find the fractional increase in density, $\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}$.
