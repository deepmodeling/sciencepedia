This first practice challenges you to determine the acceleration needed to cause a specific amount of liquid to spill from an open container. This scenario is a fantastic exercise in applying the concept of an effective gravitational field and connects the slope of the free surface directly to a tangible, volumetric outcome, honing your skills in both fluid principles and geometric analysis.", "problem": "An open-topped cubical container with an interior side length of $L$ is used to transport a liquid. Initially, the container is at rest and is filled with the liquid to exactly half its height. The container is then subjected to a constant horizontal acceleration, $a_x$, parallel to one of its sides. This acceleration is maintained long enough for the liquid surface to reach a steady state of equilibrium relative to the container. As a result of this acceleration, exactly one-third of the initial volume of the liquid spills out over the trailing edge of the container. Determine the magnitude of the acceleration, $a_x$, in terms of the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "Let the cube interior span $0 \\leq x \\leq L$ in the direction of the imposed acceleration $a_{x}$, $0 \\leq y \\leq L$ across its width, and $0 \\leq z \\leq L$ vertically upward. In the noninertial frame of the container, the fluid is in hydrostatic equilibrium under an effective acceleration with components $(-a_{x},0,-g)$. The resulting pressure gradient is $\\nabla P = \\rho(-a_{x},0,-g)$. Along the free surface where $P$ is constant, $dP = -\\rho(a_x dx + g dz) = 0$, which implies $a_x x + g z = \\text{constant}$. This is the equation of a plane. Solving for $z$,\n$$\nz(x) = c - s\\,x,\\quad \\text{with } s \\equiv \\frac{a_{x}}{g},\\; c \\equiv \\frac{\\text{constant}}{g}.\n$$\nBecause the system reaches steady state with spilling over the trailing (back) edge at $x=0$, the highest point of the free surface is pinned at the brim: $z(0)=L$. Hence $c=L$, and the free-surface profile is\n$$\nz(x) = L - s\\,x.\n$$\n\nThe remaining liquid volume equals the volume under $z(x)$ within the container, truncated by $z=0$ (bottom) and $z=L$ (top).
