Let this density be $\\rho_{AUV}$. We are given the mass of the AUV, $M$, the fraction of its volume above water, $f$, and the density of the freshwater, $\\rho_w$.\n\nThe AUV is in static equilibrium, which means the net force acting on it is zero. Two vertical forces are acting on the AUV: the downward gravitational force ($F_g$) and the upward buoyant force ($F_b$).\n\nThe gravitational force is the weight of the AUV:\n$$F_g = M g$$\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAccording to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the AUV. Let $V_{total}$ be the total volume of the AUV and $V_{sub}$ be the submerged volume. The buoyant force is then:\n$$F_b = (\\text{mass of displaced fluid}) \\times g = (\\rho_w V_{sub}) g$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, these two forces must balance each other:\n$$F_g = F_b$$\n$$M g = \\rho_w V_{sub} g$$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity, $g$, appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled out:\n$$M = \\rho_w V_{sub}$$\n\nWe are given that a fraction $f$ of the total volume is *above* the water. Therefore, the volume submerged is the remaining fraction, $(1-f)$, of the total volume.\n$$V_{sub} = (1 - f) V_{total}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $V_{sub}$ into our equilibrium equation:\n$$M = \\rho_w (1 - f) V_{total}$$\n\nThe average density of the AUV, $\\rho_{AUV}$, is defined as its total mass divided by its total volume:\n$$\\rho_{AUV} = \\frac{M}{V_{total}}$$\n\nWe want to find $\\rho_{AUV}$. We can rearrange the density definition to express the total volume as $V_{total} = \\frac{M}{\\rho_{AUV}}$. Now, we substitute this into the force balance equation:\n$$M = \\rho_w (1 - f) \\left( \\frac{M}{\\rho_{AUV}} \\right)$$\n\nThe mass $M$ is non-zero, so we can divide both sides by $M$:\n$$1 = \\frac{\\rho_w (1 - f)}{\\rho_{AUV}}$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the average density of the AUV, $\\rho_{AUV}$:\n$$\\rho_{AUV} = \\rho_w (1 - f)$$\nNotice that the final expression for the AUV's density is independent of its mass $M$.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$\\rho_w = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n$f = 0.035$\n\n$$\\rho_{AUV} = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (1 - 0.035)$$\n$$\\rho_{AUV} = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 0.965$$\n$$\\rho_{AUV} = 965 \\text{ kg/m}^3$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, 965, already has three significant figures.
