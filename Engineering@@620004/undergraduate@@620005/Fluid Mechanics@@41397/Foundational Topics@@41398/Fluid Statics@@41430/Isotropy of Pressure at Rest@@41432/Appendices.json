{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The principle that pressure in a static fluid is isotropic—acting equally in all directions at a point—is a cornerstone of fluid mechanics. This practice provides a hands-on derivation of this very principle by examining a microscopic, wedge-shaped element of fluid at rest. By applying Newton's laws for static equilibrium, you will see how the pressures on different faces of the wedge relate to each other and to the weight of the fluid, ultimately demonstrating why pressure must be direction-independent as the element shrinks to a point [@problem_id:1767797].", "problem": "To analyze the behavior of fluid pressure at a point, investigators model a small region of fluid as a two-dimensional wedge. Consider such a wedge of a static, incompressible fluid with uniform density $\\rho$. The wedge-shaped fluid element has a horizontal base of infinitesimal length $dx$ and a vertical side of infinitesimal length $dy$. A uniform gravitational field, with acceleration of magnitude $g$, acts vertically downwards. Let $p_y$ be the pressure acting on the horizontal face, $p_x$ be the pressure on the vertical face, and $p_s$ be the pressure on the slanted hypotenuse. Assume the pressure is uniform over each respective face.\n\nBy applying the condition of static equilibrium to the forces acting on this fluid element, one can derive a relationship between the pressures on the different faces. It is found that the difference between the pressure on the slanted face and the pressure on the vertical face can be written in the form $p_s - p_x = A \\cdot \\rho g dx$ and the difference between the pressure on the slanted face and the pressure on the horizontal face can be written in the form $p_s - p_y = B \\cdot \\rho g dy$. Here, $A$ and $B$ are dimensionless numerical constants.\n\nYour task is to determine the value of the constant $B$. Express your answer as a decimal or a fraction.", "solution": "Let the wedge be a right triangle of unit thickness whose horizontal base has length $dx$ (along $x$ to the right), vertical side has length $dy$ (along $y$ upward), and hypotenuse connects $(dx,0)$ to $(0,dy)$.
