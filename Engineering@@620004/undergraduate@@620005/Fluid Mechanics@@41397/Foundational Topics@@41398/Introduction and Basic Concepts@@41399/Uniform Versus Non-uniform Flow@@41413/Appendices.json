This exercise explores how the classification of a flow as 'steady' versus 'unsteady' or 'uniform' versus 'non-uniform' depends entirely on the observer's frame of reference. By analyzing the airflow around a moving bus from two different viewpoints, you will develop a more robust intuition for these core concepts, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying fluid dynamics principles [@problem_id:1808888].", "problem": "A long bus with a perfectly flat, horizontal roof travels at a constant velocity, $V$, along a straight road on a day with no wind, meaning the surrounding air is initially stationary. We are interested in classifying the airflow over the roof. Assume the bus has been traveling for a sufficient amount of time such that the flow pattern, relative to the bus, is fully established.\n\nConsider two different frames of reference:\n1.  **Ground Frame**: An observer standing still on the side of the road.\n2.  **Bus Frame**: An observer sitting on the roof of the bus.\n\nFor each frame of reference, the flow can be classified as either 'steady' or 'unsteady', and as either 'uniform' or 'non-uniform'. A flow is 'steady' if the fluid properties (like velocity) at any single point in the frame do not change over time. It is 'uniform' if the velocity is the same at all points in the flow field at any given instant.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly classifies the airflow in both frames of reference?\n\nA.

A flow is steady in a given frame if, at every fixed point in that frame, $\\partial \\mathbf{u}/\\partial t = \\mathbf{0}$. A flow is uniform at a given instant if it has no spatial variation, i.e., $\\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$ over the flow domain of interest at that instant.\n\nGround frame:\n- The surrounding air is initially at rest, so far from the bus $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{0}$. The bus moves with position $x_{b}(t) = V t$ relative to the ground, so the disturbance created by the bus sweeps past fixed spatial points. At any fixed ground point $\\mathbf{x}$ that lies within the region the bus passes, the velocity sequence is: before the bus arrives, $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\mathbf{0}$; during passage, $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is nonzero and varies with $t$; after passage, it returns to $\\mathbf{0}$. Hence, at fixed $\\mathbf{x}$, $\\partial \\mathbf{u}/\\partial t \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ during passage, so the flow is unsteady.\n- At any given instant while the bus is present, the velocity field varies strongly in space near the bus (e.g., boundary layer over the roof, leading-edge and trailing-edge effects), so $\\nabla \\mathbf{u} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$. Thus, the flow is non-uniform.\n\nBus frame:\n- Transform by a Galilean shift $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - V t \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $t' = t$, with velocity transformation $\\mathbf{u}'(\\mathbf{x}', t') = \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) - V \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. In this frame, the bus is stationary and the oncoming stream at infinity is uniform with $\\mathbf{u}' \\to -V \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. After sufficient time for the flow to establish around the stationary body, the field becomes time-independent, so $\\partial \\mathbf{u}'/\\partial t' = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, the flow is steady.\n- However, the presence of the bus induces spatial variations (e.g., boundary layer on the roof), so $\\nabla' \\mathbf{u}' \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ in the vicinity of the bus, making the flow non-uniform. Only at infinity is it uniform.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is: Ground frame—unsteady and non-uniform; Bus frame—steady and non-uniform, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1808888"}, {"introduction": "One of the key consequences of non-uniform flow is that fluid particles can accelerate even when the overall flow rate is steady. This practice problem provides a concrete example of this phenomenon, known as convective acceleration, by modeling a river widening as it enters a lake [@problem_id:1808871].
