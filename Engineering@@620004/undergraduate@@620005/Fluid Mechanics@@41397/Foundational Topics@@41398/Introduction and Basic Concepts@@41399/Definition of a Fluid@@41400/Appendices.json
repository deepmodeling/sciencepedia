Both are opaque, appear solid at room temperature, and are macroscopically identical. The team performs an experiment to determine their fundamental mechanical nature.\n\nTwo identical rectangular blocks, one of Sample Alpha and one of Sample Beta, each with height $H$ and top surface area $A$, are prepared. The bottom face of each block is securely bonded to a fixed workbench. At time $t=0$, a small, constant horizontal force $F$ is applied to the center of the top face of each block, parallel to the surface. This creates a constant shear stress $\\tau = F/A$.\n\nThe horizontal displacement, $\\Delta x$, of the top face relative to the bottom face is measured over time. The following observations are made:\n1.  At time $t_1$, the top face of Sample Alpha has displaced by an amount $\\Delta x_0$. The top face of Sample Beta has also displaced by the same amount, $\\Delta x_0$.\n2.  The force $F$ is continuously applied. At a much later time $t_2$, where $t_2 \\gg t_1$, the displacement of Sample Alpha's top face is still measured to be $\\Delta x_0$. However, the displacement of Sample Beta's top face is now measured to be a significantly larger value, $\\Delta x_2$, which continues to increase as long as the force is applied.\n3.  At time $t_2$, the force $F$ is abruptly removed from both samples.\n\nBased on the fundamental definitions of ideal elastic solids and Newtonian fluids, predict the final state of both samples a very long time after the force is removed.\n\nA. Both Sample Alpha and Sample Beta will return to their original, undeformed shape (zero displacement).\n\nB.

Both Sample Alpha and Sample Beta will remain permanently deformed, with final displacements of $\\Delta x_0$ and $\\Delta x_2$, respectively.\n\nE. Both samples will partially return towards their original shape but will retain some permanent deformation.", "solution": "Let the applied shear stress be $\\tau = F/A$, which is constant while $F$ is maintained. Denote the shear strain by $\\gamma(t)$ and note that for simple shear of a block of height $H$, the top-face displacement is related to shear strain by\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\frac{\\Delta x(t)}{H}.\n$$\n\nFor an ideal elastic solid (Hookean solid), the constitutive relation is Hooke’s law in shear:\n$$\n\\tau = G\\,\\gamma,\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus. Under a constant $\\tau$, the strain is time independent:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\frac{\\tau}{G}, \\quad \\Delta x(t) = H \\frac{\\tau}{G}.\n$$\nThus, immediately upon loading and for all $t$ while the load is held, the displacement is constant:\n$$\n\\Delta x(t) = \\Delta x_{0} = H \\frac{\\tau}{G}.\n$$\nThis matches observation 1 for Sample Alpha at time $t_{1}$ and observation 2 that even at $t_{2} \\gg t_{1}$ the displacement remains $\\Delta x_{0}$.\n\nFor a Newtonian fluid, the constitutive relation is Newton’s law of viscosity in shear:\n$$\n\\tau = \\eta\\,\\dot{\\gamma}, \\quad \\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\tau}{\\eta},\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\mathrm{d}\\gamma/\\mathrm{d}t$. Under constant $\\tau$, the strain rate is constant, so integrating in time with $\\gamma(0)=0$ gives\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\frac{\\tau}{\\eta}\\,t, \\quad \\Delta x(t) = H \\frac{\\tau}{\\eta}\\,t.\n$$\nTherefore, at $t=t_{1}$ one obtains $\\Delta x(t_{1})=\\Delta x_{0}$ provided $t_{1} = \\Delta x_{0}\\,\\eta/(H\\tau)$, consistent with observation 1. At a much later time $t_{2} \\gg t_{1}$, the displacement is\n$$\n\\Delta x(t_{2}) = H \\frac{\\tau}{\\eta}\\,t_{2} = \\Delta x_{2} \\gg \\Delta x_{0},\n$$\nand continues to increase as long as the force is applied, consistent with observation 2 for Sample Beta.\n\nAt time $t_{2}$ the force is removed, so $\\tau$ is set to zero for $t>t_{2}$. For the ideal elastic solid, the shear stress is related to strain by $\\tau = G \\gamma$. With $\\tau=0$ and the top face free of shear traction, the equilibrium condition demands\n$$\n0 = G\\,\\gamma \\implies \\gamma = 0 \\implies \\Delta x = 0.\n$$\nThus Sample Alpha returns to its original, undeformed state, and this recovery is ideal (no creep or delay in an ideal elastic solid).\n\nFor the Newtonian fluid, after removal of the force one has $\\tau=0$, so\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\tau}{\\eta} = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t>t_{2}.\n$$\nHence $\\gamma(t)$ is constant for $t>t_{2}$:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\gamma(t_{2}) = \\frac{\\Delta x_{2}}{H},\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\n\\Delta x(t) = \\Delta x_{2} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t>t_{2}.\n$$\nThere is no elastic restoring tendency in a Newtonian fluid, so the deformation accumulated up to $t_{2}$ remains as a permanent set.\n\nThus, a very long time after the force is removed, the ideal elastic Sample Alpha returns to zero displacement, while the Newtonian Sample Beta retains the displacement $\\Delta x_{2}$.

It is often assumed that a fluid in static equilibrium cannot sustain tensile stress.

This is possible due to the strong cohesive forces between water molecules and the confinement within microscopic xylem conduits, which suppresses the formation of vapor bubbles (cavitation).\n\nWe can model the limit of this tension by analyzing the stability of a pre-existing, microscopic bubble of water vapor (a cavitation nucleus) within the liquid water.
