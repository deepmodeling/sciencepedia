The fluid is initially at rest. At time $t=0$, the piston begins to move, creating a flow. Due to the large cross-section of the cylinder and the nature of the fluid, we can model the resulting flow as being spatially uniform at any given instant in time. The velocity field of the fluid for $t \\ge 0$ is described by the Eulerian description $\\vec{V}(x, y, z, t) = (B t^3 + C t) \\hat{i}$, where $\\hat{i}$ is a constant unit vector pointing along the axis of the cylinder, $t$ is time, and $B$ and $C$ are positive real constants.
