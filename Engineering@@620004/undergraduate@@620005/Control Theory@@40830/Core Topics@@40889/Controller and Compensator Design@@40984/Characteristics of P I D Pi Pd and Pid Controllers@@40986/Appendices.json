The plant model, controller type, and feedback structure are standard. The definitions of $K_u$ and $P_u$ are correct according to the ZN methodology. The required analysis using fundamental stability criteria is a standard academic exercise. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function for the system with proportional control is $L(s) = C(s)G(s) = K_p \\frac{K}{s^2} = \\frac{K K_p}{s^2}$.\nFor a unity-feedback system, the closed-loop transfer function is $T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)}$.\nThe stability of the closed-loop system is determined by the roots of its characteristic equation, which is given by $1 + L(s) = 0$.\nSubstituting $L(s)$, we obtain:\n$$1 + \\frac{K K_p}{s^2} = 0$$\n$$s^2 + K K_p = 0$$\nThis is the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system. The roots of this equation are the closed-loop poles. Since $K>0$ and $K_p>0$, the product $K K_p$ is a positive real number. The poles are:\n$$s = \\pm \\sqrt{-K K_p} = \\pm j \\sqrt{K K_p}$$\nFor any positive gain $K_p > 0$, the closed-loop system has a pair of purely imaginary poles on the $j\\omega$-axis at $\\omega = \\pm \\sqrt{K K_p}$ and no poles in the right-half plane. A system with such pole placement is defined as **marginally stable**. It will exhibit sustained oscillations with a natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K K_p}$ in response to any non-zero initial condition or transient input.\n\nThe core principle of the ZN closed-loop method is to find a specific proportional gain, the \"ultimate gain\" $K_u$, which marks the boundary between asymptotic stability and instability. Typically, for a system to be a candidate for this method, there must exist a range of gains $0 < K_p < K_u$ for which the closed loop is asymptotically stable. As $K_p$ is increased to $K_u$, a pair of poles reaches the imaginary axis, causing sustained oscillations. For $K_p > K_u$, these poles move into the right-half plane, making the system unstable.\n\nFor the double-integrator plant, this condition is not met. There is no region of asymptotic stability for $K_p > 0$. The system is marginally stable for all positive proportional gains. Consequently, *any* gain $K_p>0$ produces sustained oscillations, meaning the concept of a unique \"ultimate gain\" $K_u$ as a stability threshold is not applicable.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n**A. For unity feedback with proportional control $C(s)=K_p$, the closed-loop characteristic equation is $s^2+K K_p=0$, which yields purely imaginary closed-loop poles for any $K_p>0$; hence there is no asymptotically stable region under proportional control, and an ultimate gain $K_u$ that separates stable from unstable regimes does not exist as a finite positive threshold.**\nThis statement is a direct and accurate summary of my derivation above. The characteristic equation is correctly identified as $s^2+K K_p=0$. The poles are indeed purely imaginary for any $K_p>0$, which means the system is never asymptotically stable. The ZN method requires a transition from stability to instability to define $K_u$. As no such transition exists—the system is always on the stability boundary—an ultimate gain $K_u$ in the sense intended by Ziegler and Nichols cannot be uniquely determined. The statement is logically sound and factually correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The Nyquist locus of $L(j\\omega)=\\dfrac{K K_p}{(j\\omega)^2}$ lies on the negative real axis and does not encircle the critical point $-1$ for any $K_p>0$; therefore the closed loop is asymptotically stable for all $K_p>0$, and the ultimate gain $K_u$ is unbounded.**\nLet us analyze the Nyquist plot of $L(s) = \\frac{K K_p}{s^2}$. On the imaginary axis, $s=j\\omega$:\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K K_p}{(j\\omega)^2} = \\frac{K K_p}{j^2 \\omega^2} = -\\frac{K K_p}{\\omega^2}$$\nFor $\\omega \\in (0, \\infty)$, $L(j\\omega)$ traces the real axis from $-\\infty$ to $0$. The statement that the locus lies on the negative real axis is correct. It is also true that this part of the locus does not encircle the point $-1$. However, the conclusion \"therefore the closed loop is asymptotically stable\" is incorrect. The standard Nyquist criterion ($Z=N+P$) is subtle for systems with open-loop poles on the imaginary axis, like the double pole at $s=0$ here. A more direct analysis reveals that for any $K_p > 0$, there exists a frequency $\\omega_c = \\sqrt{K K_p}$ such that $|L(j\\omega_c)| = \\frac{K K_p}{(\\sqrt{K K_p})^2} = 1$ and $\\arg(L(j\\omega_c)) = -180^\\circ$. This means the Nyquist plot passes directly through the critical point $-1+j0$. This condition corresponds to zero gain margin and zero phase margin, which signifies marginal stability, not asymptotic stability. The conclusion is a false inference from an incomplete application of the Nyquist criterion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Ziegler–Nichols (ZN) closed-loop tuning is ill-posed for the double-integrator plant because any $K_p>0$ produces a marginally stable oscillation whose period $P=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{K K_p}}$ varies continuously with $K_p$, so there is no unique pair $(K_u,P_u)$ to anchor the ZN rules.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the fundamental flaw in applying the ZN method to this plant. As established, any gain $K_p > 0$ results in marginal stability. The oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{K K_p}$, which gives an oscillation period $P = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{K K_p}}$. Since every $K_p > 0$ leads to sustained oscillations, every such gain could be considered an \"ultimate gain\". This yields an infinite set of possible pairs $(K_p, P(K_p))$, not the single, unique pair $(K_u, P_u)$ that the ZN tuning rules require as input. The procedure is therefore ill-posed because its necessary precondition—the existence of a unique stability boundary crossing—is not satisfied.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Approximating $G(s)$ by a First-Order-Plus-Dead-Time (FOPDT) model from a unit-step test allows reliable use of the ZN reaction-curve (open-loop) rules because the double integrator’s step response is sigmoidal with a well-defined inflection point.**\nThis statement proposes using the alternative ZN method, the open-loop or reaction-curve method. This requires analyzing the plant's open-loop step response. The step response $y(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s) = G(s) \\cdot U(s)$, where $U(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$ is the unit step input.\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{K}{s^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{K}{s^3}$$\nThe inverse Laplace transform is:\n$$y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{K}{s^3}\\right\\} = \\frac{K}{2} t^2$$\nThis is a parabolic response that grows to infinity. A sigmoidal (\"S-shaped\") response, upon which the ZN reaction-curve method is based, is characterized by an initial shallow slope, an inflection point where the slope is maximal, and a final leveling off to a new steady-state value. The response $y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} K t^2$ is not sigmoidal; it does not level off and it does not have an inflection point (its second derivative, $y''(t) = K$, is a non-zero constant). Therefore, the premise that the step response is sigmoidal is factually false, and the ZN open-loop method is not applicable.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Replacing the proportional controller by a proportional-derivative controller $C(s)=K_p(1+T_d s)$ with $T_d>0$ yields a finite ultimate gain $K_u$ for the modified loop; hence one may apply ZN closed-loop tuning on the modified loop to obtain a full Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for the original plant.**\nLet us examine the stability of the modified loop. The new open-loop transfer function is $L'(s) = C(s)G(s) = K_p(1+T_d s) \\frac{K}{s^2}$. The new characteristic equation is $1+L'(s)=0$:\n$$1 + \\frac{K K_p (1+T_d s)}{s^2} = 0$$\n$$s^2 + K K_p T_d s + K K_p = 0$$\nThis is a standard second-order characteristic equation of the form $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0$. By comparing coefficients, we have $\\omega_n^2 = K K_p$ and $2\\zeta\\omega_n = K K_p T_d$. All coefficients ($1$, $K K_p T_d$, $K K_p$) are positive for $K>0, K_p>0, T_d>0$. By the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, a second-order polynomial with all positive coefficients has its roots in the left-half plane. Therefore, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable for all positive values of $K_p$ and $T_d$. Since the system is always stable, it can never be made to exhibit sustained oscillations. No finite positive gain $K_p$ will place the poles on the imaginary axis. Thus, an ultimate gain $K_u$ does not exist for this modified loop either. The premise of the statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2732027"}]}
