In industrial process control, the sensitivity of a proportional controller is often described by its Proportional Band (PB) rather than its proportional gain ($K_p$). This exercise provides practice in converting between these two inversely related parameters, a crucial skill for interpreting controller settings in various industrial applications [@problem_id:1602483]. Understanding this relationship helps build an intuitive feel for how a \"wide\" or \"narrow\" band corresponds to less or more aggressive control action.", "problem": "In a process control system for a chemical reactor, a proportional-only controller is used to maintain the temperature. The controller manipulates a steam valve, which represents the Controller Output (CO). The CO can range from 0% (fully closed) to 100% (fully open). The temperature measurement is the Process Variable (PV), which is monitored over a specific calibrated range.\n\nA key tuning parameter for this type of controller is the Proportional Band (PB). The PB is defined as the percentage of the PV's measurement range over which a 100% change in the CO will occur. For this particular reactor, the control engineer has set the PB to 40%.\n\nThe proportional gain, $K_p$, is the dimensionless parameter used in the controller's fundamental algorithm, which relates the change in controller output to the error (the difference between the setpoint and the PV). The standard relationship between the dimensionless proportional gain $K_p$ and the Proportional Band (expressed in percent, PB%) is given by the formula $K_p = \\frac{100\\%}{\\text{PB}\\%}$.\n\nCalculate the dimensionless proportional gain $K_p$ that corresponds to the specified Proportional Band setting of 40%.", "solution": "The proportional-only controller uses the standard relationship between proportional gain and proportional band: when PB is expressed as a fraction of the PV range (i.e., as a unitless decimal), the gain is the reciprocal of PB. This follows from the given percentage-based formula by converting to fractional form.\n\nLet the fractional proportional band be denoted by $PB_{f}$, defined as the percentage PB divided by 100, so it is a unitless fraction of full scale. The given PB is forty percent, thus\n$$\nPB_{f} = 0.40 = \\frac{2}{5}.\n$$\nUsing the standard relation in fractional form,\n$$\nK_{p} = \\frac{1}{PB_{f}}.\n$$\nSubstitute $PB_{f} = \\frac{2}{5}$:\n$$\nK_{p} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5.\n$$\nTherefore, the dimensionless proportional gain corresponding to a proportional band of forty percent is $K_{p} = 2.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.5}$$", "id": "1602483"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful aspects of control theory is its ability to link theoretical models with real-world observations.

To test the system, a step input command is issued, requesting the joint to move from an angle of $0$ to a new target angle of $1.000$ radian. The engineer observes the system's response and records the following data: the joint angle successfully reaches the target of $1.000$ radian at steady state, but it exhibits an underdamped response, reaching a maximum peak angle of $1.595$ radians. The time at which this first peak occurs is measured to be $0.1300$ seconds.\n\nBased on this experimental data and the known velocity gain constant, determine the numerical value of the proportional gain $K_p$ used by the controller.
