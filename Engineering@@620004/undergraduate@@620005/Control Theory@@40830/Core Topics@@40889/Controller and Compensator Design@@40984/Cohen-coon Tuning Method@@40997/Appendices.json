The time-domain equation for a PI controller is:\n$$u(t) = u_{ss} + K_c e(t) + \\frac{K_c}{T_i} \\int_0^{t} e(t') dt'$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the controller output at time $t$, $u_{ss}$ is the initial steady-state controller output, and $e(t)$ is the error signal, $e(t) = r(t) - y(t)$, where $r(t)$ is the setpoint and $y(t)$ is the process output.\n\nAt $t=0$, a unit step change is applied to the setpoint, so $r(t)=1$ for $t \\ge 0$. Since the system was at steady-state, $y(0)=0$. The initial error is $e(0^+) = r(0^+) - y(0^+) = 1-0 = 1$.
