The transfer function of this compensator is given by:\n$$C(s) = K \\frac{s+z}{s+p}$$\nHere, $s$ is the complex frequency variable. The parameters $K$, $z$, and $p$ are positive real constants representing the gain, the zero location, and the pole location, respectively. For the device to function as a lead compensator, its zero must be located closer to the origin on the negative real axis than its pole, which implies the condition $0 < z < p$.\n\nThe primary benefit of this compensator is the positive phase shift (phase lead) it introduces into the system's open-loop frequency response. This phase lead is a function of the angular frequency $\\omega$. As a control systems engineer, your task is to determine the specific angular frequency, $\\omega_{max}$, at which this phase lead reaches its maximum possible value.\n\nDerive a general expression for $\\omega_{max}$ in terms of the compensator's pole location $p$ and zero location $z$.", "solution": "Evaluate the compensator on the imaginary axis by setting $s = j\\omega$.
