A fundamental property of polynomials with real coefficients is that their nonreal roots occur in complex conjugate pairs.

This contradicts the symmetry of the root locus about the real axis and thus violates the principle that the root locus is symmetric with respect to the real axis.\n\nFor completeness, note:\n- Symmetry with respect to the imaginary axis is not a general root-locus property.\n- The number of branches equals the number of open-loop poles ($2$ here), which is not directly contradicted by the observation.\n- Branches do start at open-loop poles and terminate at open-loop zeros or go to infinity; this statement is not directly contradicted by the observation.\n\nHence, the violated principle is the symmetry with respect to the real axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1617851"}, {"introduction": "Understanding symmetry is not just a theoretical exercise; it provides practical shortcuts for analyzing system behavior.
