Determine how many more branches the root locus plot for System B has compared to the root locus plot for System A.", "solution": "The root locus consists of as many branches as the number of closed-loop poles, which equals the number of open-loop poles (counting multiplicities) for unity feedback. This follows from the closed-loop characteristic equation for unity feedback,\n$$\n1+K G_{0}(s)=0,\n$$\nwhere $G_{0}(s)$ is the loop transfer function without the gain $K$. Multiplying by the denominator of $G_{0}(s)$ yields a characteristic polynomial whose degree equals the number of open-loop poles, so the number of branches equals that degree.\n\nFor System A, write $G_{A}(s)=K G_{0A}(s)$ with $G_{0A}(s)=\\frac{1}{s(s+a)}$.

The dynamic behavior of this closed-loop system is described by its characteristic equation, which relates the complex frequency variable $s$ to a key adjustable system parameter, the controller gain $K$. For the system in question, this relationship is given by the polynomial equation:\n$$s^3 + 5s^2 + Ks + 3K = 0$$\nThe root locus method is used to visualize how the roots of this characteristic equation (the system's closed-loop poles) move in the complex $s$-plane as the gain $K$ is varied from $0$ to $\\infty$.

To determine the number of branches, we must first rearrange the given equation into this standard form.\n\nThe given characteristic equation is:\n$$s^3 + 5s^2 + Ks + 3K = 0$$\n\nFirst, we separate the terms that contain the parameter $K$ from those that do not:\n$$(s^3 + 5s^2) + K(s + 3) = 0$$\n\nNext, to achieve the form $1 + K \\cdot (\\text{expression}) = 0$, we divide the entire equation by the terms not multiplied by $K$, which are $(s^3 + 5s^2)$:\n$$1 + \\frac{K(s + 3)}{s^3 + 5s^2} = 0$$\n\nNow the equation is in the standard form $1 + K G_{eq}(s) = 0$, where the equivalent open-loop transfer function is:\n$$G_{eq}(s) = \\frac{s + 3}{s^3 + 5s^2}$$\n\nA fundamental rule of root locus construction states that the number of branches is equal to the number of poles of the open-loop transfer function, $G_{eq}(s)$. Each branch of the locus originates from one of the open-loop poles (at $K=0$) and terminates at either an open-loop zero or at infinity (as $K \\to \\infty$).\n\nLet $P$ be the number of open-loop poles and $Z$ be the number of open-loop zeros.\nThe number of branches is equal to $P$ (if $P \\ge Z$) or $Z$ (if $Z > P$), which can be written as $\\max(P, Z)$. For any physical system, the order of the denominator polynomial is greater than or equal to the order of the numerator polynomial, so $P \\ge Z$. Therefore, the number of branches is simply the number of open-loop poles, $P$.\n\nThe open-loop poles are the roots of the denominator of $G_{eq}(s)$. The denominator is $s^3 + 5s^2$.\nWe can factor the denominator to find the poles:\n$$s^3 + 5s^2 = s^2(s + 5)$$\nSetting the denominator to zero gives $s^2(s + 5) = 0$. The roots are $s = 0$ (with a multiplicity of 2) and $s = -5$.\nThus, there are three open-loop poles: one at $s = -5$ and a double pole at $s = 0$. The total number of poles is $P = 3$.\n\nThe open-loop zeros are the roots of the numerator of $G_{eq}(s)$. The numerator is $s+3$.\nSetting the numerator to zero gives $s+3=0$, so there is one zero at $s=-3$. The number of zeros is $Z=1$.\n\nSince the number of branches is equal to the number of open-loop poles, $P$, the total number of branches is 3. These three branches will start at the poles located at $s=0, 0, -5$.
