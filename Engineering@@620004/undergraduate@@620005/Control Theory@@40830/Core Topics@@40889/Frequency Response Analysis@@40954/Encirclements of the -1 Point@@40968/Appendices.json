For such systems, stability is not achieved by simply avoiding the $-1$ point, but by encircling it a specific number of times to counteract the open-loop instabilities. This practice [@problem_id:1578123] will guide you through this analysis and introduce the gain margin, a critical measure of stability robustness that can be determined directly from the plot.", "problem": "A control engineer is evaluating the stability of a magnetic levitation system. The system's open-loop transfer function, $L(s)$, is known to have exactly one pole in the right-half of the s-plane and no poles on the imaginary axis.\n\nFor a specific proportional controller gain $K = K_0$, a frequency response analysis is performed. The Nyquist plot of $L(j\\omega)$ for angular frequencies $\\omega$ from $0$ to $\\infty$ is found to have the following characteristics:\n1.  The plot begins at the point $(-2.0, j0)$ for $\\omega=0$.\n2.  As $\\omega$ increases from $0$ towards $\\infty$, the plot intersects the negative real axis at exactly one other point, which is $(-0.5, j0)$.\n3.  The plot approaches the origin as $\\omega \\to \\infty$.\n4.  The full Nyquist plot, corresponding to $\\omega$ from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, encircles the critical point $(-1, j0)$ exactly once in the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nBased on this information, determine the gain margin of the closed-loop system. The gain margin is defined as the factor by which the nominal gain $K_0$ can be multiplied before the system becomes marginally stable.", "solution": "We use the Nyquist stability criterion, $Z = P + N$, for the closed-loop characteristic equation $1+L(s)=0$. Here, $P$ is the number of open-loop poles in the right-half plane and $N$ is the number of clockwise encirclements of the critical point $-1$ by the Nyquist plot of $L(s)$.\n\nThe problem states that $L(s)$ has exactly one right-half-plane pole, so $P=1$. The problem also states that the full Nyquist plot encircles $-1$ exactly once counter-clockwise. A counter-clockwise encirclement corresponds to $N=-1$ in our convention. Therefore, the number of unstable closed-loop poles is:\n$$Z = P + N = 1 + (-1) = 0$$\nSince $Z=0$, the closed-loop system at the nominal gain $K_{0}$ is stable.\n\nTo determine the gain margin, consider multiplying the nominal loop gain by a positive factor $g$, so the new loop transfer function becomes $L_{g}(j\\omega)=g L(j\\omega)$. The Nyquist plot scales radially about the origin by the factor $g$. Marginal stability occurs when the scaled plot passes through the critical point $-1$, i.e., when there exists a phase-crossover frequency $\\omega_{\\text{pc}}$ such that $L_g(j\\omega_{\\text{pc}})=-1$. This is equivalent to finding a frequency where the phase of $L(j\\omega_{\\text{pc}})$ is $-180^\\circ$ and the magnitude condition $g|L(j\\omega_{\\text{pc}})|=1$ is met.\n\nFrom the given Nyquist plot characteristics, the negative real-axis crossings (where phase is $-180^\\circ$) occur at $L(j0)=-2.0$ and at another frequency where $L(j\\omega)=-0.5$. The magnitudes at these crossings are $|L(j0)|=2.0$ and $|L(j\\omega)|=0.5$.\n\nThe gain factors $g$ that would move these crossing points to $-1$ are:\n- For the first crossing: $g \\times (-2.0) = -1 \\implies g = 0.5$. This means if we reduce the gain by a factor of 2, the system becomes marginally stable.\n- For the second crossing: $g \\times (-0.5) = -1 \\implies g = 2.0$. This means if we increase the gain by a factor of 2, the system becomes marginally stable.\n\nThe gain margin (GM) is typically defined as the factor by which the nominal gain can be *increased* before the system becomes unstable. Therefore, the gain margin is the smallest scaling factor $g > 1$ that causes instability. In this case, that value is 2.\n$$\n\\text{Gain Margin} = 2\n$$\nThis corresponds to the classical definition $\\text{GM} = 1/|L(j\\omega_{\\text{pc}})|$ evaluated at the phase-crossover frequency where $|L|1$, which gives $1/0.5=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1578123"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates all the concepts into a complete design-oriented problem. Instead of interpreting a given plot, you will start with a system's mathematical model and apply the Nyquist criterion as a powerful analytical tool. The goal [@problem_id:2728471] is to determine the precise range of controller gain $K$ that stabilizes an open-loop unstable system, showcasing how this method transitions from pure analysis to practical controller design.", "problem": "Consider a unity-feedback loop with open-loop transfer function $L(s)=\\dfrac{K}{(s-1)(s+3)}$, where $K$ is a positive real constant. The open-loop system has one right-half-plane pole at $s=1$. Using the Nyquist Stability Criterion, determine the exact critical gain $K^{\\star}0$ at which the Nyquist plot passes through the $-1$ point, thereby separating stable from unstable closed-loop behavior. Report only this critical value $K^{\\star}$ as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires finding the critical gain $K^{\\star}$ for stability using the Nyquist Stability Criterion. The open-loop transfer function is $L(s) = \\dfrac{K}{(s-1)(s+3)}$, with $K>0$.\n\nThe Nyquist Stability Criterion is given by the equation $Z = P + N$, where:\n- $P$ is the number of open-loop poles of $L(s)$ in the open right-half-plane (RHP).\n- $Z$ is the number of closed-loop poles in the RHP. For stability, we require $Z=0$.\n- $N$ is the number of net clockwise (CW) encirclements of the critical point $-1$ by the Nyquist plot of $L(s)$. A counter-clockwise (CCW) encirclement counts as $N=-1$.\n\nFirst, we determine $P$. The open-loop transfer function $L(s)$ has poles at $s=1$ and $s=-3$. The pole at $s=1$ lies in the RHP. Therefore, the number of unstable open-loop poles is $P=1$.\n\nFor the closed-loop system to be stable, we need $Z=0$. Substituting $Z=0$ and $P=1$ into the Nyquist equation gives the required number of encirclements:\n$$0 = 1 + N \\implies N = -1$$\nThus, for stability, the Nyquist plot must encircle the point $-1$ exactly once in the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nNext, we analyze the Nyquist plot by evaluating $L(s)$ on the imaginary axis, $s=j\\omega$:\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K}{(j\\omega-1)(j\\omega+3)} = \\frac{K}{(-\\omega^2 - 3) + j(2\\omega)}$$\nTo find where the plot intersects the real axis, we set the imaginary part of $L(j\\omega)$ to zero. After rationalizing, the imaginary part is:\n$$\\text{Im}[L(j\\omega)] = \\frac{-2K\\omega}{(-\\omega^2 - 3)^2 + (2\\omega)^2}$$\nSince $K>0$, the imaginary part is zero only when $\\omega=0$. This is the only frequency where the plot for $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$ crosses the real axis.\n\nWe evaluate the function at this crossing frequency:\n$$L(j0) = \\frac{K}{(-1)(3)} = -\\frac{K}{3}$$\nLet's determine the shape of the plot. For $\\omega \\in (0, \\infty)$, the real part is negative and the imaginary part is negative, so the plot lies in the third quadrant. For $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive, so the plot lies in the second quadrant. As $\\omega \\to \\pm\\infty$, $|L(j\\omega)| \\to 0$. The plot for $\\omega:-\\infty \\to \\infty$ traces a circle from the origin, through the second quadrant to $-K/3$, and back to the origin through the third quadrant. This path constitutes a single counter-clockwise (CCW) loop.\n\nStability requires one CCW encirclement of $-1$, which means $N=-1$. This occurs if and only if the point $-1$ is inside the CCW loop traced by the plot. The loop extends from $0$ to $-K/3$ on the real axis. For $-1$ to be enclosed, the leftmost point of the plot must be to the left of $-1$:\n$$-\\frac{K}{3}  -1 \\implies K > 3$$\nFor $K>3$, the system is stable ($N=-1 \\implies Z=1-1=0$). For $0  K  3$, the point $-1$ is not encircled ($N=0 \\implies Z=1+0=1$), so the system is unstable.\n\nThe critical gain $K^{\\star}$ is the boundary case where the Nyquist plot passes directly through the point $-1$. This occurs when the real-axis intercept is exactly $-1$:\n$$L(j0) = -\\frac{K^{\\star}}{3} = -1$$\nSolving for $K^{\\star}$ gives:\n$$K^{\\star} = 3$$\nAt this gain, the system is marginally stable.
