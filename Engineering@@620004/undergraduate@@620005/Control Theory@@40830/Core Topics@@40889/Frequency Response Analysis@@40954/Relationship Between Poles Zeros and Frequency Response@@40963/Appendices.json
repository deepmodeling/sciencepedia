The frequency response of the system is obtained by evaluating the transfer function at $s=j\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The magnitude of the frequency response, often plotted on a logarithmic scale in decibels (dB), provides insight into the system's behavior.\n\nThe engineer's measurements reveal two key characteristics of the system's magnitude response:\n1.  At very low frequencies (as $\\omega \\to 0$), the magnitude $|H(j\\omega)|$ approaches a constant, non-zero value.\n2.  At very high frequencies (as $\\omega \\to \\infty$), the magnitude is observed to decrease at a steady asymptotic rate of -40 decibels (dB) for every factor of ten increase in frequency. This rate is commonly referred to as -40 dB/decade.\n\nAssuming the system is stable and has a minimal realization (i.e., no pole-zero cancellations), determine the value of $n_p - n_z$, where $n_p$ is the total number of poles and $n_z$ is the number of finite zeros of the transfer function $H(s)$.", "solution": "Let the rational transfer function be written as\n$$\nH(s)=K\\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{n_{z}}(s-z_{i})}{\\prod_{k=1}^{n_{p}}(s-p_{k})},\n$$\nwhere $n_{p}$ is the total number of poles and $n_{z}$ is the number of finite zeros.\n\nEvaluating on the imaginary axis for the frequency response, set $s=j\\omega$.
