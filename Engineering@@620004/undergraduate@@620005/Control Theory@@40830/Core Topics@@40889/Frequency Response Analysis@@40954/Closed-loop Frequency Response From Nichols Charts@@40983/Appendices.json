At these two crossing points, the corresponding magnitudes are found to be $-12$ dB and $+8$ dB.\n\nA proportional controller with an adjustable gain $K$ is cascaded with $G(s)$, resulting in a new open-loop transfer function $L(s) = K G(s)$.

The system is stable for all values of $K_{dB}$.", "solution": "The stability of the closed-loop system is determined by the Nyquist stability criterion. The criterion relates the number of unstable closed-loop poles, $Z$, to the number of unstable open-loop poles, $P$, and the number of clockwise encirclements of the critical point $(-1, 0)$ by the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function $L(j\\omega)$. The relation is given by $Z = P + N$.\n\nFor the closed-loop system to be stable, we require $Z=0$. The problem states that the original open-loop transfer function $G(s)$ is stable. Since the controller is a simple gain $K$, the new open-loop transfer function $L(s) = K G(s)$ is also stable for any positive $K$. Thus, the number of open-loop poles in the right-half plane is $P=0$. Substituting $Z=0$ and $P=0$ into the Nyquist criterion gives $0 = 0 + N$, which simplifies to $N=0$. Therefore, for closed-loop stability, the Nyquist plot must not encircle the critical point $(-1, 0)$.\n\nThe Nichols chart is a representation of the frequency response in a gain (dB) vs. phase (degrees) plot. The critical point $(-1, 0)$ in the complex plane corresponds to a magnitude of $|-1| = 1$ and a phase of $\\arg(-1) = -180^\\circ$. In decibels, a magnitude of 1 is $20 \\log_{10}(1) = 0$ dB. So, the critical point on the Nichols chart is $(0 \\text{ dB}, -180^\\circ)$.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is $L(j\\omega) = K G(j\\omega)$. In decibels, the magnitude is:\n$$|L(j\\omega)|_{dB} = |K G(j\\omega)|_{dB} = |K|_{dB} + |G(j\\omega)|_{dB}$$\nUsing the problem's notation, $|K|_{dB} = K_{dB}$, so:\n$$|L(j\\omega)|_{dB} = |G(j\\omega)|_{dB} + K_{dB}$$\nThe phase of $L(j\\omega)$ is the same as the phase of $G(j\\omega)$ (assuming $K>0$). This means that applying the gain $K$ (or $K_{dB}$) results in a vertical shift of the entire Nichols plot of $G(j\\omega)$ by an amount $K_{dB}$.\n\nThe original plot for $G(j\\omega)$ (which corresponds to $K=1$, or $K_{dB}=0$) crosses the $-180^\\circ$ phase line at magnitudes of $-12$ dB and $+8$ dB. When the plot is shifted vertically by $K_{dB}$, the new crossing points on the $-180^\\circ$ line will have magnitudes of $(-12 + K_{dB})$ dB and $(8 + K_{dB})$ dB.\n\nFor a typical system exhibiting conditional stability like this, the portion of the Nichols plot between these two phase crossings lies to the left of the $-180^\\circ$ line. An encirclement of the critical point $(0 \\text{ dB}, -180^\\circ)$ occurs if the critical point's magnitude, $0$ dB, falls between the magnitudes of the two crossing points. This would place the critical point to the right of the contour segment that lies to the left of the $-180^\\circ$ line, resulting in an encirclement ($N \\neq 0$) and an unstable closed-loop system.\n\nThe condition for instability is therefore:\n$$ \\min(-12 + K_{dB}, 8 + K_{dB}) < 0 < \\max(-12 + K_{dB}, 8 + K_{dB}) $$\nSince $-12 < 8$, this simplifies to the simultaneous conditions:\n$$ -12 + K_{dB} < 0 $$\n$$ 8 + K_{dB} > 0 $$\n\nSolving these two inequalities for $K_{dB}$:\n1. $K_{dB} < 12$\n2. $K_{dB} > -8$\n\nCombining these, the range of $K_{dB}$ for which the system is unstable is $-8 < K_{dB} < 12$.\n\nThe closed-loop system is stable when it is not unstable. Therefore, the system is stable if $K_{dB}$ lies outside this interval. This corresponds to the two disjoint ranges:\n$$ K_{dB} \\le -8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad K_{dB} \\ge 12 $$\nAt the boundaries $K_{dB}=-8$ and $K_{dB}=12$, the Nichols plot passes directly through the critical point, resulting in marginal stability. The choices provided use strict inequalities, which define the ranges for guaranteed stability, excluding the marginal cases. Thus, the ranges for stability are:\n$$ K_{dB} < -8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad K_{dB} > 12 $$\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1562929"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just ensuring stability, control design often involves tuning system parameters to achieve a desired performance balance.
