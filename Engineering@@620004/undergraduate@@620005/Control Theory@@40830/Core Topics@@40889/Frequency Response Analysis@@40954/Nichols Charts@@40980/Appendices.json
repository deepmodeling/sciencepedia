The open-loop transfer function of the system is given by $G(s) = K \\cdot G_p(s)$, where $K$ is an adjustable proportional gain and $G_p(s)$ represents the plant dynamics. The system is initially configured with a gain of $K=1$.\n\nFor this initial configuration, the engineer analyzes the system's frequency response on a Nichols chart.

Hence, to achieve a phase margin of $45$ degrees, the phase at the gain crossover must be $-180 + 45 = -135$ degrees.\n\nSince adjusting $K$ does not change phase, we must enforce that the frequency with phase $-135$ degrees becomes the gain crossover, i.e., its magnitude must be shifted to $0$ dB.

Many systems are stable only within a specific range of controller gains, and some may even be open-loop unstable to begin with. This problem demonstrates how the Nichols chart, when interpreted through the lens of the Nyquist stability criterion, provides all the necessary information to determine the precise range of gains that will stabilize such a system, solidifying your understanding of advanced stability analysis.[@problem_id:1595697]", "problem": "A feedback control system is described by the open-loop transfer function $L(s) = K G(s)$, where $K$ is an adjustable positive proportional controller gain.

For the closed-loop system to be stable, we need $Z=0$.

The critical point $(-1, 0)$ in the Nyquist plane corresponds to $(0 \\text{ dB}, -180^\\circ)$ on the Nichols chart.

This corresponds to the Nyquist plot crossing the negative real axis in a downward direction. As $K$ increases past $K_1$, this crossing passes to the left of $-1$, adding a clockwise encirclement, which means $N$ decreases by 1.\n-   At $\\omega_2$, the phase is decreasing ($d\\phi/d\\omega  0$). This corresponds to an upward crossing of the negative real axis. As $K$ increases past $K_2$, this crossing passes to the left of $-1$, adding a CCW encirclement, which means $N$ increases by 1.\n\nNow we analyze the stability for different ranges of $K$, starting with a very small $K$ where the entire plot is far below the critical point and thus $N=0$.\n-   **For $0  K  K_2$ ($ \\approx 0.501$):** Both crossings are to the right of $-1$ on the Nyquist plot.

The upward crossing at $\\omega_2$ has moved past $-1$, adding one CCW encirclement. The downward crossing at $\\omega_1$ is still to the right of $-1$. Thus, $N=1$. Then $Z = P - N = 1 - 1 = 0$.
