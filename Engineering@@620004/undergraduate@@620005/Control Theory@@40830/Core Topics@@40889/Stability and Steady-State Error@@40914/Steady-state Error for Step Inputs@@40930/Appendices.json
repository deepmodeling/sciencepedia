The plant, which represents the dynamics from the controller's electrical output to the sphere's vertical position, is modeled by the first-order transfer function $P(s) = \\frac{K}{\\tau s + a}$.

Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "The problem asks for the steady-state error $e_{ss}$ of a unity feedback control system subjected to a step input. We can find this using the Final Value Theorem.\n\nFirst, let's define the components of the control system.\nThe open-loop transfer function, $G(s)$, is the product of the controller transfer function, $C(s)$, and the plant transfer function, $P(s)$.\n$$G(s) = C(s)P(s) = (K_d s) \\left( \\frac{K}{\\tau s + a} \\right) = \\frac{K K_d s}{\\tau s + a}$$\nThe input is a step of magnitude $\\Delta y$.

We can verify this by checking the poles of the closed-loop transfer function, which are the roots of the characteristic equation $1 + G(s) = 0$.\n$$1 + \\frac{K K_d s}{\\tau s + a} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\tau s + a + K K_d s}{\\tau s + a} = 0$$\n$$(\\tau + K K_d)s + a = 0$$\nThe single closed-loop pole is located at $s = -\\frac{a}{\\tau + K K_d}$. Since $K, \\tau, a,$ and $K_d$ are all positive real constants, the pole is on the negative real axis, confirming the system's stability.\n\nNow, we can proceed with calculating the limit:\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s E(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta y}{s}}{1 + \\frac{K K_d s}{\\tau s + a}} \\right)$$\nThe $s$ in the numerator cancels with the $s$ from the Laplace transform of the step input:\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta y}{1 + \\frac{K K_d s}{\\tau s + a}}$$\nTo evaluate the limit, we can substitute $s=0$ into the expression since the function is continuous at $s=0$:\n$$e_{ss} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{1 + \\frac{K K_d (0)}{\\tau (0) + a}} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{1 + \\frac{0}{a}}$$\nSince $a$ is a positive constant, $a \\neq 0$.\n$$e_{ss} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{1 + 0} = \\Delta y$$\n\nThis result means that the steady-state error is equal to the magnitude of the step input itself. Physically, this implies that the system output, the sphere's position, returns to zero in the steady state, failing to track the constant reference signal $\\Delta y$. The reason for this behavior lies in the purely derivative controller. In the steady state, the error $e(t)$ must approach a constant value, $e_{ss}$. The derivative of a constant is zero. Therefore, the output of the controller, which is proportional to the derivative of the error, becomes zero in the steady state. With zero input from the controller, the plant's output (the sphere's position) returns to its equilibrium position, which is zero. The reference is $\\Delta y$ and the output is $0$, resulting in a final error of $\\Delta y - 0 = \\Delta y$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\Delta y}$$", "id": "1616808"}]}
