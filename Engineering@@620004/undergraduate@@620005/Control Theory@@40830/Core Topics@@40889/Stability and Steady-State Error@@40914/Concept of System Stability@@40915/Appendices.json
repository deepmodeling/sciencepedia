The damping classification for a second-order system follows from the nature of the roots:\n- If $\\Delta < 0$ (i.e., $K^{2} < 16$), then $0 < K < 4$ and the roots are complex conjugates with real part $-K/2<0$, which corresponds to underdamped behavior.\n- If $\\Delta = 0$ (i.e., $K = 4$), then the roots are a repeated real root $s = -K/2 = -2$, which is critically damped.\n- If $\\Delta > 0$ (i.e., $K > 4$), then the roots are distinct real numbers. Using Vieta’s relations, $r_{1} + r_{2} = -K < 0$ and $r_{1} r_{2} = 4 > 0$, so both roots are real and negative, which corresponds to overdamped behavior.\n\nEquivalently, comparing $s^{2} + K s + 4 = 0$ to the standard form $s^{2} + 2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s + \\omega_{n}^{2} = 0$ gives $\\omega_{n}^{2} = 4$ so $\\omega_{n} = 2$ and $\\zeta = \\frac{K}{2 \\omega_{n}} = \\frac{K}{4}$.
