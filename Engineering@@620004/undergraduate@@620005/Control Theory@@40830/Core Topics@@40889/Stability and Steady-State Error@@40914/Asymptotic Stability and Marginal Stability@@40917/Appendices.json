Finally, we will find the system's time-domain response to a step input to determine its long-term behavior.\n\nFirst, let's find the transfer function $G(s)$. We are given the governing differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = v(t)\n$$\nWe take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. The Laplace transform of the derivative $\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}$ is $sX(s) - x(0)$. The Laplace transform of $v(t)$ is $V(s)$. The equation in the Laplace domain becomes:\n$$\nsX(s) - x(0) = V(s)\n$$\nThe problem states that the object starts at the origin, so the initial condition is $x(0) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nsX(s) = V(s)\n$$\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ is the ratio of the output transform $X(s)$ to the input transform $V(s)$:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{X(s)}{V(s)} = \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\nThis system is known as a pure integrator.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of the system. The stability is determined by the location of the poles of the transfer function, which are the roots of the denominator polynomial. For $G(s) = 1/s$, the denominator is $s$. Setting the denominator to zero gives the pole location:\n$$\ns = 0\n$$\nThe system has a single pole located at the origin of the complex s-plane. According to the criteria for stability of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems:\n- A system is asymptotically stable if all its poles are in the open left-half of the s-plane (i.e., have negative real parts).\n- A system is unstable if it has any poles in the open right-half of the s-plane, or if it has repeated poles on the imaginary axis.\n- A system is marginally stable if it has no poles in the right-half plane, and has one or more simple (non-repeated) poles on the imaginary axis.\n\nSince our system has a single, non-repeated pole at $s=0$ (which lies on the imaginary axis), the system is classified as **marginally stable**. This eliminates options A, C, and E.\n\nNow, we determine the long-term behavior of the position $x(t)$ when the input is a constant positive velocity, $v(t) = v_0$ for $t \\ge 0$. This input is a step function of magnitude $v_0$. The Laplace transform of this input is:\n$$\nV(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{v_0 \\cdot u(t)\\} = \\frac{v_0}{s}\n$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the Heaviside unit step function.\n\nThe output transform $X(s)$ is the product of the transfer function and the input transform:\n$$\nX(s) = G(s) V(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{v_0}{s}\\right) = \\frac{v_0}{s^2}\n$$\nTo find the position $x(t)$, we take the inverse Laplace transform of $X(s)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{v_0}{s^2}\\right\\} = v_0 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s^2}\\right\\}\n$$\nThe inverse Laplace transform of $1/s^2$ is the ramp function, $t \\cdot u(t)$. Therefore, the position as a function of time is:\n$$\nx(t) = v_0 t \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0\n$$\nThis result is also clear from direct integration of the original differential equation: $x(t) = x(0) + \\int_0^t v(\\tau) d\\tau = 0 + \\int_0^t v_0 d\\tau = v_0 t$.\n\nTo determine the long-term behavior, we examine the limit of $x(t)$ as time $t$ approaches infinity:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} v_0 t = \\infty\n$$\nSince $v_0$ is a positive constant, the position $x(t)$ grows linearly with time and goes to infinity. Thus, the position **grows indefinitely**.\n\nCombining our findings: the system is marginally stable, and its response to a constant velocity input is a position that grows indefinitely.
