The dynamic behavior of the equipment, when subjected to an external force $F(t)$, can be effectively modeled as a simple mass-damper system. The velocity $v(t)$ of the equipment's center of mass, of mass $m$, is described by the linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$m \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} + b v(t) = F(t)$$\nwhere $b$ is the viscous damping coefficient of the damper.\n\nThe time constant of this first-order system characterizes how quickly the velocity responds to a change in the applied force. Initially, the system is configured with a damper having a coefficient $b_{1}$, resulting in a time constant $\\tau_{1}$. For a new application, the engineer needs to modify the system's response.
