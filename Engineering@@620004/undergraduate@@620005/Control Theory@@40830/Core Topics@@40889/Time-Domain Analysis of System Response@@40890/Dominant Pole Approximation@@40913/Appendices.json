The simplification should be based on retaining the slowest dynamic mode of the original system while discarding the faster one. Furthermore, the simplified model $\\hat{G}(s)$ must be constructed such that its steady-state response to a constant input is identical to that of the original system $G(s)$.\n\nDetermine the expression for the simplified first-order transfer function $\\hat{G}(s)$.", "solution": "The goal is to find a first-order approximation $\\hat{G}(s)$ for the given second-order transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{20}{(s+2)(s+10)}$ that preserves the dominant dynamic mode and the steady-state response to a constant input.\n\nFirst, we identify the dynamic modes of the system by finding the poles of the transfer function. The poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial, $(s+2)(s+10)=0$. The poles are located at $s_1 = -2$ and $s_2 = -10$.\n\nEach pole $s_p$ corresponds to a term in the system's transient response of the form $e^{s_p t}$. The time constant associated with each pole is $\\tau = -1/s_p$. For our poles, the time constants are $\\tau_1 = -1/(-2) = 0.5$ seconds and $\\tau_2 = -1/(-10) = 0.1$ seconds.\n\nThe \"slowest dynamic mode\" corresponds to the pole with the largest time constant, which is the pole closest to the imaginary axis in the s-plane. This is called the dominant pole. Comparing the magnitudes of the pole locations, $|-2| < |-10|$, we identify $s_1 = -2$ as the dominant pole. The pole at $s_2 = -10$ corresponds to a faster-decaying mode and can be neglected in a first-order approximation.\n\nThe simplified first-order model $\\hat{G}(s)$ will therefore have its pole at the location of the dominant pole, $s=-2$. A general first-order transfer function with a pole at $s=-2$ has the form:\n$$\\hat{G}(s) = \\frac{K}{s+2}$$\nwhere $K$ is a gain constant that we must determine.\n\nNext, we use the constraint that the steady-state response to a constant input must be the same for both systems. The steady-state response to a constant input is determined by the system's DC gain, which is found by evaluating the transfer function at $s=0$.\n\nFor the original system $G(s)$, the DC gain is:\n$$G(0) = \\frac{20}{(0+2)(0+10)} = \\frac{20}{2 \\times 10} = \\frac{20}{20} = 1$$\n\nFor the simplified first-order model $\\hat{G}(s)$, the DC gain is:\n$$\\hat{G}(0) = \\frac{K}{0+2} = \\frac{K}{2}$$\n\nTo preserve the steady-state response, we must equate the DC gains:\n$$\\hat{G}(0) = G(0)$$\n$$\\frac{K}{2} = 1$$\nSolving for $K$, we find $K=2$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this value of $K$ back into the expression for our simplified model to obtain the final answer.\n$$\\hat{G}(s) = \\frac{2}{s+2}$$\nThis is the first-order approximation of the original system that retains the dominant pole and the DC gain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{s+2}}$$", "id": "1572309"}, {"introduction": "While the dominant pole approximation is a powerful tool, it's crucial to recognize when its standard form does not apply.
