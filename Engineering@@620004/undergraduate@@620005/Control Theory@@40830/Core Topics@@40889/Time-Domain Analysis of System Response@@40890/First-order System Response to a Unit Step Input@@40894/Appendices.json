Understanding this principle is the first step in characterizing and calibrating any first-order system. [@problem_id:1576080]", "problem": "A simple temperature sensor is being calibrated. Its response to a change in ambient temperature can be accurately modeled as a first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Initially, the sensor is in thermal equilibrium with a room at a constant temperature. At time $t=0$, the sensor is subjected to a step change in temperature by moving it into an environment that is precisely 1.0 degree Celsius hotter than the room. This corresponds to a unit step input. After a sufficiently long time, the sensor's output voltage reading settles to a steady value of 4.0 mV.\n\nNow, consider a different experiment. Starting from the same initial conditions in the room, the sensor is instead moved into an environment that is 3.0 degrees Celsius hotter than the room. Assuming the sensor operates within its linear range, what will be the final steady output voltage reading?
