The system's dynamic response to a command to move to a new position can be accurately modeled as a standard underdamped second-order system. A critical performance specification is the overshoot; when the arm moves to a new position, it must not go too far past the target before settling. For the photolithography process to be successful, the maximum peak overshoot beyond the target position must be strictly less than 5% of the total distance of the move.\n\nThe degree of overshoot is determined by the system's dimensionless damping ratio, denoted by $\\zeta$.
