Many systems that appear 'linear' in a colloquial sense, like a sensor with a straight-line response, may not satisfy the strict definition required in control theory.

The superposition principle is composed of two fundamental properties: additivity and homogeneity.\n- **Additivity**: If an input $x_1(t)$ produces an output $y_1(t)$ and an input $x_2(t)$ produces an output $y_2(t)$, then the input $x_1(t) + x_2(t)$ must produce the output $y_1(t) + y_2(t)$.\n- **Homogeneity (or Scaling)**: If an input $x(t)$ produces an output $y(t)$, then for any real scalar constant $\\alpha$, the input $\\alpha x(t)$ must produce the output $\\alpha y(t)$.\n\nConsider a common type of sensor system whose output signal $y(t)$ is related to its input physical measurement $x(t)$ by the following equation:\n$$y(t) = m x(t) + b$$\nwhere $m$ and $b$ are non-zero real constants. The constant $m$ represents the sensitivity of the sensor, and $b$ represents a constant offset or bias in the output.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the properties of this sensor system?\n\nA.
