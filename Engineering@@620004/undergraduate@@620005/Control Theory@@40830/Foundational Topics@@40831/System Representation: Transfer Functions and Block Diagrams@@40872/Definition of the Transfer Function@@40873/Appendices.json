The population size at any time $t$ is denoted by $N(t)$. In the absence of external influences, the rate of change of the population, $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$, is directly proportional to the current population size. The constant of proportionality, representing the net birth-death rate, is denoted by $k$. To manage the species, a conservation agency implements a program that adds or removes individuals at a controlled, time-varying rate $r(t)$. This stocking rate $r(t)$ acts as the input to the system, while the resulting population $N(t)$ is considered the output.\n\nThe governing differential equation for the system is thus given by the sum of the natural population change and the external stocking rate. For the purpose of system analysis, assume the habitat is initially empty, meaning the initial population $N(0)$ is zero.\n\nDetermine the transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{N(s)}{R(s)}$ of this population model, where $N(s)$ and $R(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of the population $N(t)$ and the stocking rate $r(t)$, respectively.

The reactor maintains a constant liquid volume $V$. An acidic process stream, containing a strong acid at a molar concentration $C_a$, enters the reactor at a constant volumetric flow rate $F_a$. To control the pH, a basic stream, containing a strong base at a molar concentration $C_b$, is added to the reactor at a manipulable volumetric flow rate $F_b(t)$. The contents of the reactor are perfectly mixed, and the mixture exits at a rate equal to the sum of the inlet flow rates, $F_a + F_b(t)$.\n\nThe chemical reaction involves a strong acid and a strong base, which is considered instantaneous. The crucial equilibrium that determines the pH is the autoionization of water, governed by the ion product constant $K_w = [H^+][OH^-]$, where $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ are the molar concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions, respectively.
