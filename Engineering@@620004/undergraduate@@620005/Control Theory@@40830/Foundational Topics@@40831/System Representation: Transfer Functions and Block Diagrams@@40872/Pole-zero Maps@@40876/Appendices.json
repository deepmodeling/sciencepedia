A fundamental requirement for any acceptable model is that it must be Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable.

To characterize its dynamic behavior, a unit step voltage (a voltage that changes instantaneously from 0 V to 1 V and stays there) is applied to its input. The output voltage is recorded, and the following key features are observed in the response:\n\n1.  The output voltage eventually settles to a constant, steady-state value.\n2.
