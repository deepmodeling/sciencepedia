The loops are defined by the paths they trace through the system's nodes:\n\n- **Loop 1:** A local feedback loop that starts at node $n_1$ and returns to node $n_1$. Its gain is $L_1(s) = G_1(s) H_1(s)$.\n- **Loop 2:** A feedback loop that starts at node $n_2$, passes through node $n_1$, and returns to node $n_2$.
