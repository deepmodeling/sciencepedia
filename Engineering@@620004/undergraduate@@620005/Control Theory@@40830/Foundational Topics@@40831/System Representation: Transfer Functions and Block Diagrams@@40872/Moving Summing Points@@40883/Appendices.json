This is a crucial first step in mastering block diagram manipulation for system simplification.", "problem": "In the analysis of a feedforward control system, we encounter a specific signal processing arrangement. A primary signal, represented in the Laplace domain as $U(s)$, is combined with a secondary signal, $V(s)$, at a summing junction. The output of this junction, which is the sum of the two signals, is then passed through an amplifier block characterized by a constant proportional gain $K$. The resulting signal is the final output of the arrangement, denoted as $Y(s)$.\n\nFor the purpose of restructuring the system's block diagram, an engineer proposes to move the summing junction from its current position *before* the amplifier to a new position *after* the amplifier. In this modified configuration, the primary signal $U(s)$ now feeds directly into the amplifier block. The secondary signal $V(s)$, however, must be passed through a new, currently unknown, compensatory block with a transfer function $H(s)$ before being summed with the amplifier's output.\n\nTo ensure that this modification does not alter the functional behavior of the system, the final output $Y(s)$ of the new configuration must be identical to the output of the original configuration for any arbitrary inputs $U(s)$ and $V(s)$. Determine the required transfer function, $H(s)$, for the compensatory block.", "solution": "The problem asks us to find the transfer function $H(s)$ of a compensatory block required to maintain an identical system output after reconfiguring a block diagram. We can solve this by expressing the output of the original system and the modified system algebraically and then equating them.\n\nFirst, let's determine the output of the original system, which we will call $Y_{orig}(s)$. In this configuration, the signals $U(s)$ and $V(s)$ are first summed. The output of the summing junction is therefore $U(s) + V(s)$. This combined signal is then passed through the amplifier with gain $K$. The final output is the product of the amplifier gain and its input signal.\n$$Y_{orig}(s) = K \\cdot (U(s) + V(s))$$\nBy distributing the gain $K$, we can write this as:\n$$Y_{orig}(s) = K \\cdot U(s) + K \\cdot V(s)$$\n\nNext, let's determine the output of the modified system, which we will call $Y_{new}(s)$. In this new configuration, the summing junction is moved to after the amplifier. The primary signal $U(s)$ now passes directly through the amplifier, resulting in an intermediate signal $K \\cdot U(s)$. The secondary signal $V(s)$ is passed through the new compensatory block with transfer function $H(s)$, resulting in an intermediate signal $H(s) \\cdot V(s)$. These two intermediate signals are then combined at the new summing junction.\n$$Y_{new}(s) = K \\cdot U(s) + H(s) \\cdot V(s)$$\n\nThe core requirement is that the two configurations must be equivalent, meaning their outputs must be identical for all possible inputs $U(s)$ and $V(s)$. Therefore, we set $Y_{orig}(s) = Y_{new}(s)$.\n$$K \\cdot U(s) + K \\cdot V(s) = K \\cdot U(s) + H(s) \\cdot V(s)$$\nTo solve for $H(s)$, we can simplify this equation. Subtracting the term $K \\cdot U(s)$ from both sides gives:\n$$K \\cdot V(s) = H(s) \\cdot V(s)$$\nSince this equation must hold true for any arbitrary secondary signal $V(s)$ (assuming $V(s)$ is not identically zero), we can divide both sides by $V(s)$.\n$$H(s) = K$$\nThus, the transfer function of the compensatory block must be equal to the gain $K$ of the amplifier. This means the secondary signal must be amplified by the same gain $K$ before being summed to achieve an equivalent system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{K}$$", "id": "1594539"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercise, we now explore the reverse operation: moving a summing point backward across a block.

To ensure that the overall system response remains identical to Configuration 1, the disturbance signal $D(s)$ is first passed through a new compensator block with transfer function $H(s)$.
