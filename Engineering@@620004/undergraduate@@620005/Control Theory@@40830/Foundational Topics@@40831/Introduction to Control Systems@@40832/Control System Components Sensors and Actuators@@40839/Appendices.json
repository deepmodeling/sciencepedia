The valve's operation can be modeled by a series of components. The process is as follows:\n\n1.  A controller sends an electrical signal, a control voltage $v(t)$, to a current-to-pressure (I/P) transducer located near the control room. The transducer converts the voltage signal into a gauge pressure signal $p_c(t)$. This conversion is linear with a gain of $K_v = 1.25 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ Pa/V}$.\n\n2.  This pressure signal travels from the transducer to the valve actuator through a long, narrow pneumatic line of length $L = 25.725 \\text{ m}$. The pressure wave propagates through the air in the line at the speed of sound, $c = 343 \\text{ m/s}$, introducing a transport delay.\n\n3.  The valve actuator, which consists of a diaphragm and a spring, receives the delayed pressure signal. The actuator's response, which results in the linear displacement $x(t)$ of the valve stem, can be modeled as a first-order system.

At time $t=0$, the control voltage is subjected to a step input, changing instantaneously from 0 V to a constant value of $V_0$.\n\nDetermine the time, in seconds, at which the reactant flow rate $q(t)$ first reaches 63.2% of its final steady-state value.
