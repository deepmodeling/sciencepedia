However, its true power is realized when we can connect it back to the system's behavior in the time domain. This first exercise focuses on this fundamental translation, asking you to determine the initial terms of the system's impulse response, $g(k)$, directly from its pulse transfer function, revealing the step-by-step output a system produces in response to a single input pulse [@problem_id:1603544].", "problem": "A simple digital filter, often used as a building block in audio effects, is characterized by its pulse transfer function in the Z-domain. For a particular first-order Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter, this function is given by:\n$$\nG(z) = \\frac{2}{1 - 0.8z^{-1}}\n$$\nThe behavior of the filter is fundamentally described by its response to a unit impulse input. This response is a sequence of values, $g(k)$, where $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ represents discrete time steps. Determine the first four terms of this unit impulse response sequence, corresponding to $g(0)$, $g(1)$, $g(2)$, and $g(3)$.", "solution": "The pulse transfer function, $G(z)$, of a discrete-time system is defined as the Z-transform of its unit impulse response sequence, $g(k)$. This relationship is expressed as a power series in the variable $z^{-1}$:\n$$\nG(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} g(k) z^{-k} = g(0) + g(1)z^{-1} + g(2)z^{-2} + g(3)z^{-3} + \\dots\n$$\nTo find the individual terms of the sequence $g(k)$, we need to expand the given rational function $G(z)$ into a power series in $z^{-1}$.

This is the third remainder.\nThe quotient so far is $2 + 1.6z^{-1} + 1.28z^{-2}$.\n\nStep 4: Determine $g(3)$.\nDivide the first term of the latest remainder ($1.024z^{-3}$) by the first term of the divisor ($1$): $1.024z^{-3} / 1 = 1.024z^{-3}$. The coefficient, $1.024$, is the fourth term of our result, $g(3)$.\nThe process can continue indefinitely, which is characteristic of an IIR filter. The quotient after four steps is $2 + 1.6z^{-1} + 1.28z^{-2} + 1.024z^{-3} + \\dots$.\n\nBy comparing the resulting series with the definition of $G(z)$, we can identify the first four terms of the impulse response sequence:\n$g(0) = 2$\n$g(1) = 1.6$\n$g(2) = 1.28$\n$g(3) = 1.024$\n\nThe required sequence of the first four terms is therefore $(2, 1.6, 1.28, 1.024)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1.6 & 1.28 & 1.024 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "1603544"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple analysis, pulse transfer functions are central to the design of digital controllers.
