Which of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental reason for this contradiction, based on the properties of the Z-transform and its Region of Convergence (ROC)?\n\nA. A system with a pole at $z=2$ cannot be causal, because all poles of a causal system must be located inside the unit circle, i.e., $|z|1$.\n\nB.
