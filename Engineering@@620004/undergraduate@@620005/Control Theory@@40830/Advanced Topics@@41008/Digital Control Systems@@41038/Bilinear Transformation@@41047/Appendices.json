A key observation is that strictly proper analog filters—those with more poles than zeros—always produce a digital filter with a zero at $z=-1$. This practice challenges you to explain this phenomenon by examining the fundamental mapping between the s-plane and the z-plane, revealing a deeper connection between the two domains.", "problem": "In digital signal processing and control theory, the bilinear transformation is a standard method for converting a continuous-time (analog) system's transfer function, $H(s)$, into a discrete-time (digital) system's transfer function, $H(z)$. The transformation is defined by the substitution $s = c \\frac{z-1}{z+1}$, where $c$ is a positive real constant, often related to the sampling period.\n\nA common observation is that if the original analog transfer function $H(s)$ is strictly proper, meaning the degree of its denominator polynomial is strictly greater than the degree of its numerator polynomial, the resulting digital transfer function $H(z)$ will always have a zero at $z=-1$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly explains this phenomenon?\n\nA. The point $s=\\infty$ in the s-plane, where a strictly proper transfer function evaluates to zero, is mapped to the point $z=-1$ in the z-plane by the bilinear transformation.\n\nB. The origin of the s-plane ($s=0$) is mapped to $z=1$ in the z-plane.

The bilinear transformation is a first-order Padé approximation of the exponential function $z = e^{sT}$. This approximation is known to be inaccurate at high frequencies, leading to the creation of an artificial zero at the Nyquist frequency, which corresponds to $z=-1$.\n\nD. Any poles of the analog filter $H(s)$ that lie on the imaginary axis in the s-plane are mapped directly onto the unit circle in the z-plane.
