Its orientation is described by the angle $\\theta(t)$ it makes with a fixed reference axis. The robots can collectively apply a controlled net torque to the boom, which produces an angular acceleration $\\alpha(t) = \\ddot{\\theta}(t)$.\n\nThe maneuver must start from rest at an initial angle $\\theta(0) = 0$ and bring the boom to a final target angle $\\theta_f > 0$. The boom must also be at rest at the end of the maneuver.\n\nA critical constraint is the structural integrity of the boom. The magnitude of the maximum internal bending moment, $B$, is known to be directly proportional to the magnitude of the angular acceleration, such that $B = k |\\alpha|$, where $k$ is a positive constant of proportionality. To prevent structural failure, this bending moment must not exceed a critical value $B_{max}$.
