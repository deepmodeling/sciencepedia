An equilibrium point $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ is a state where the system ceases to evolve, meaning $\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dx_2}{dt} = 0$.\n\nFirst, we find the nullclines for the system.\nThe $x_1$-nullclines are the curves where $\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = 0$:\n$x_1(1 - x_1 - x_2) = 0$\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n1. $x_1 = 0$ (the $x_2$-axis)\n2. $1 - x_1 - x_2 = 0 \\implies x_2 = 1 - x_1$ (a straight line)\n\nThe $x_2$-nullclines are the curves where $\\frac{dx_2}{dt} = 0$:\n$x_2(0.5 - 0.25x_2 - 0.75x_1) = 0$\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n1. $x_2 = 0$ (the $x_1$-axis)\n2. $0.5 - 0.25x_2 - 0.75x_1 = 0 \\implies 0.25x_2 = 0.5 - 0.75x_1 \\implies x_2 = 2 - 3x_1$ (a straight line)\n\nThe equilibrium points are the intersections of an $x_1$-nullcline with an $x_2$-nullcline.

This represents the extinction of both platforms.\n\n2.  **Intersection of $x_2=0$ and $x_2 = 1-x_1$**: This case is not applicable since we need to intersect an $x_1$-nullcline with an $x_2$-nullcline. Let's intersect $x_2=0$ (an $x_2$-nullcline) with $x_2=1-x_1$ (an $x_1$-nullcline). Setting $x_2=0$ in $x_2 = 1 - x_1$ gives $0 = 1 - x_1 \\implies x_1 = 1$. This gives the equilibrium $E_2 = (1, 0)$, where ConnectSphere captures the entire market.\n\n3.  **Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_2 = 2 - 3x_1$**: Setting $x_1=0$ in $x_2 = 2 - 3x_1$ gives $x_2 = 2$. This gives the equilibrium $E_3 = (0, 2)$, where PixelVerse captures the market. (Note: A market share of 2 is not physically realistic, but it is a valid equilibrium point of the mathematical model).\n\n4.  **Intersection of $x_2=1-x_1$ and $x_2=2-3x_1$**: This represents the coexistence of both platforms.\n    $1 - x_1 = 2 - 3x_1 \\implies 2x_1 = 1 \\implies x_1 = 0.5$.\n    Substituting back into $x_2 = 1-x_1$, we get $x_2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$. This gives the coexistence equilibrium $E_4 = (0.5, 0.5)$.\n\nSo, we have four equilibrium points: $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(0.5, 0.5)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of these points by computing the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $f_1(x_1, x_2) = x_1 - x_1^2 - x_1x_2$ and $f_2(x_1, x_2) = 0.5x_2 - 0.25x_2^2 - 0.75x_1x_2$.\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(x_1, x_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1}  \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_1}  \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - 2x_1 - x_2  -x_1 \\\\ -0.75x_2  0.5 - 0.5x_2 - 0.75x_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point to find the eigenvalues.\n- **At $E_1 = (0,0)$**: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = 0.5$. Since both are positive, $(0,0)$ is an unstable node.\n\n- **At $E_2 = (1,0)$**: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2(1)-0  -1 \\\\ -0.75(0)  0.5-0.5(0)-0.75(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -1 \\\\ 0  -0.25 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = -1, \\lambda_2 = -0.25$. Since both are negative, $(1,0)$ is a stable node.\n\n- **At $E_3 = (0,2)$**: $J(0,2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2(0)-2  0 \\\\ -0.75(2)  0.5-0.5(2)-0.75(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ -1.5  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = -1, \\lambda_2 = -0.5$. Since both are negative, $(0,2)$ is a stable node.\n\n- **At $E_4 = (0.5, 0.5)$**:\n$$\nJ(0.5, 0.5) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2(0.5)-0.5  -0.5 \\\\ -0.75(0.5)  0.5-0.5(0.5)-0.75(0.5) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  -0.5 \\\\ -0.375  -0.125 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(J) = (-0.5)(-0.125) - (-0.5)(-0.375) = 0.0625 - 0.1875 = -0.125$.\nSince the determinant is negative, the eigenvalues have opposite signs. Therefore, $(0.5, 0.5)$ is a saddle point, which is unstable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe system has two stable equilibrium points, $(1,0)$ and $(0,2)$, where one platform dominates and the other vanishes. The coexistence equilibrium $(0.5, 0.5)$ is an unstable saddle point. This means that if the system starts exactly at $(0.5, 0.5)$, it will stay there, but any small perturbation will cause it to move away towards one of the two stable nodes. The stable manifold of the saddle point acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase space into basins of attraction for the two stable equilibria. Therefore, the final outcome (which platform wins) depends on the initial market shares. This scenario is a classic example of competitive exclusion.\n\n- **Option A is incorrect** because the coexistence equilibrium is unstable (a saddle point), not stable.\n- **Option B is correct**. It correctly identifies the two stable \"single-winner\" states and the dependence on initial conditions.\n- **Option C is incorrect** because two stable equilibria exist.\n- **Option D is incorrect** because $(0,2)$ is also a stable equilibrium, so ConnectSphere does not always win.\n- **Option E is incorrect** as there are no limit cycles; the system settles into one of the stable nodes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1584503"}, {"introduction": "Linearization is a potent tool for assessing stability, but it can be inconclusive in certain critical cases, such as when the linearized system's eigenvalues lie on the imaginary axis.
