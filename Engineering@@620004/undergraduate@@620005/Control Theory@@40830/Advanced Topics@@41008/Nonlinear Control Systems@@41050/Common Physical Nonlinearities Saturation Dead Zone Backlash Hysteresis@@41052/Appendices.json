Unlike a dead zone, backlash has memory—its output depends on the history of the input's direction. This thought experiment challenges you to act as a system identification engineer and devise an input signal that can unambiguously distinguish a memoryless dead zone from a state-dependent backlash nonlinearity [@problem_id:1563699]. This exercise highlights a crucial practical skill: designing tests to probe the underlying physics of a system.", "id": "1563699", "problem": "An engineer is tasked with identifying the nature of a static nonlinearity within a mechanical system. The system's output, $y(t)$, is related to its input, $u(t)$, by one of two possible nonlinear functions. For simplicity, the linear gain of the system is normalized to unity. The two possibilities are a dead zone nonlinearity, $N_{DZ}$, or a backlash nonlinearity, $N_{BL}$. All physical quantities can be considered to be in arbitrary, consistent units.\n\nThe dead zone nonlinearity is defined by a width parameter $D > 0$. The output $y_{DZ}(t)$ is given by:\n$$\ny_{DZ}(t) = \\begin{cases}\nu(t) - D & \\text{if } u(t) > D \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } -D \\le u(t) \\le D \\\\\nu(t) + D & \\text{if } u(t) < -D\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe backlash nonlinearity is defined by a total width parameter $2B > 0$. Its behavior is state-dependent:\n- When the input $u(t)$ reverses direction, the output $y_{BL}(t)$ remains constant until the input has changed by the amount $2B$.\n- After this \"slack\" is traversed, the output again tracks the input, maintaining a constant offset of $\\pm B$. For an input starting at $u(0)=0$ and initially increasing, the output is $y_{BL}(t) = u(t) - B$ as long as $u(t)$ is increasing.\n\nThe engineer must devise an input signal $u(t)$ that produces a qualitatively different output waveform depending on whether the system contains the dead zone or the backlash. The parameters are known to satisfy $0 < 2B < D$. Which of the following options correctly pairs an input signal with the resulting distinct output behaviors that would allow for unambiguous identification?\n\nA. Input Signal: A symmetric triangular wave oscillating between $-2D$ and $+2D$.\n    - Predicted Dead Zone Output: A triangular wave identical to the input.\n    - Predicted Backlash Output: A triangular wave with horizontal segments at the peaks and troughs.\n\nB. Input Signal: A single step function, $u(t) = 2D$ for $t > 0$ and $u(t)=0$ for $t \\le 0$.\n    - Predicted Dead Zone Output: A delayed step function, where the output is $0$ for a short time before jumping to a constant value.\n    - Predicted Backlash Output: An instantaneous step function to a constant value.\n\nC. Input Signal: An input signal that, for $t>0$, ramps linearly from $0$ to $2D$, then immediately ramps linearly down to $1.5D$, and then immediately ramps linearly back up.\n    - Predicted Dead Zone Output: The output waveform will be a shifted and scaled replica of the input signal's shape (ramp up, ramp down, ramp up).\n    - Predicted Backlash Output: The output will ramp up, but will then remain constant at its peak value during the entire time the input ramps down and then part of the way back up.\n\nD. Input Signal: A sinusoidal input $u(t) = (D/2) \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n    - Predicted Dead Zone Output: The output is always zero.\n    - Predicted Backlash Output: The output is a distorted sinusoid, scaled down in amplitude.\n\n", "solution": "We are asked to distinguish between a dead zone nonlinearity, which is memoryless, and a backlash nonlinearity, which is hysteretic with slack of total width $2B$, knowing $0<2B<D$. The dead zone mapping is\n$$\ny_{DZ}(t)=\\begin{cases}\nu(t)-D & \\text{if }u(t)>D,\\\\\n0 & \\text{if }|u(t)|\\le D,\\\\\nu(t)+D & \\text{if }u(t)<-D,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhich is static and memoryless. The backlash behavior is state-dependent: when $u(t)$ is monotonically increasing, $y_{BL}(t)=u(t)-B$; when $u(t)$ is monotonically decreasing, $y_{BL}(t)=u(t)+B$; upon each reversal of $u(t)$, the output holds constant until the input traverses a total change of $2B$, after which it resumes tracking on the opposite branch with the appropriate offset.\n\nWe test each option against these definitions, using only the stated inequality $0<2B<D$.\n\nOption A: Input is a symmetric triangular wave between $-2D$ and $+2D$.\n- Dead zone: Whenever $|u(t)|\\le D$, $y_{DZ}(t)=0$, and when $|u(t)|>D$, $y_{DZ}(t)=u(t)-\\operatorname{sgn}(u)D$. Therefore the output cannot be identical to the input; it has zero segments around the center and is shifted by $\\pm D$ outside. Hence the stated “identical to the input” is incorrect.\n- Backlash: At each peak/trough (input reversal), $y_{BL}(t)$ holds constant for an input excursion of $2B$, creating horizontal segments. This part is qualitatively correct. However, because the dead zone prediction is wrong, Option A is invalid.\n\nOption B: Input is a single step, $u(t)=2D$ for $t>0$, $u(t)=0$ for $t\\le 0$.\n- Dead zone: At $t=0^{+}$, since $2D>D$, the output is $y_{DZ}(0^{+})=2D-D=D$, i.e., an instantaneous jump; there is no delay because the nonlinearity is static. The stated “delayed step” is incorrect.\n- Backlash: Starting from $u(0)=0$ and increasing to $2D$, $y_{BL}$ jumps to $2D-B$ (rate-independent). The stated “instantaneous step” is qualitatively correct. Because the dead zone part is incorrect, Option B is invalid.\n\nOption C: Input ramps up from $0$ to $2D$, then down to $1.5D$, then up again.\n- Dead zone: For $0\\le u(t)\\le D$, $y_{DZ}=0$; for $u(t)>D$, $y_{DZ}=u(t)-D$. Thus after $u$ crosses $D$, the output is a copy of the input with a constant negative shift $D$ and slope one in each ramp segment, and with no memory across reversals. The resulting waveform is a ramp up, ramp down, ramp up, matching the shape of the input above threshold, exactly as described (a shifted replica of the input’s piecewise-linear shape).\n- Backlash: Initially increasing, $y_{BL}=u-B$ up to $u=2D$. At the first reversal (start of the down ramp), the output holds constant while the input decreases by $2B$. Since the down-ramp magnitude is $2D-1.5D=0.5D$, two cases arise:\n  1) If $2B\\ge 0.5D$, then the entire down ramp lies within the slack and $y_{BL}$ remains constant for the whole down ramp; upon the subsequent up ramp, $y_{BL}$ stays constant until the remaining slack is traversed, then resumes tracking. This exactly matches the stated behavior “remain constant at its peak value during the entire time the input ramps down and then part of the way back up.”\n  2) If $2B<0.5D$, then $y_{BL}$ remains constant for the first $2B$ of the down ramp, then resumes tracking with $y_{BL}=u+B$ for the remainder. In either case there is a clear, state-dependent flat segment at the reversal, which the dead zone cannot produce. Thus this input yields qualitatively distinct and unambiguous behaviors.\nBecause the described dead zone and backlash behaviors are correct and distinguishing, Option C is valid.\n\nOption D: Input is $u(t)=(D/2)\\sin(\\omega t)$.\n- Dead zone: Since $|u(t)|\\le D/2<D$, $y_{DZ}(t)=0$ for all $t$, which matches the stated prediction.\n- Backlash: At each reversal, the output holds constant over an input change of $2B$. Over each half-cycle the input changes by $D$, and since $2B<D$, flat segments must occur near each peak and trough. Therefore the output is not merely a scaled sinusoid; it has flat portions. The stated “distorted sinusoid, scaled down in amplitude” is incorrect. Hence Option D is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only Option C correctly pairs an input with distinct and correctly described behaviors that allow unambiguous identification under $0<2B<D$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "Once a nonlinearity is identified, the next step is often to mitigate its effects.
