This exercise moves beyond purely mechanical examples to the domain of thermal dynamics, challenging you to think fundamentally about what information is essential. The core principle is that state variables are typically associated with a system's independent energy storage elements; here, you'll see how the temperatures of the rooms represent their stored thermal energy, making them the natural choice for state variables [@problem_id:1614475].", "problem": "An engineer is tasked with developing a control system to regulate the temperature in a modern office building. A simplified model of the system consists of two adjacent rooms, Room A and Room B. Room A is equipped with a controllable electric heater that supplies heat at a rate of $P_{in}(t)$. Heat can transfer between the two rooms, as well as from each room to the outside environment. The outside ambient temperature, $T_{amb}$, is considered constant. The thermal properties of the rooms are described by their respective thermal capacitances, $C_A$ and $C_B$, and the thermal resistances for the heat transfer paths: $R_{AB}$ (between Room A and Room B), $R_{A,amb}$ (between Room A and the ambient), and $R_{B,amb}$ (between Room B and the ambient).\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the rates of change of the temperatures in each room, $T_A(t)$ and $T_B(t)$. The goal is to construct a state-space model for this system. A state-space model requires identifying the system's state variables, which form a minimal set of variables whose values at a time $t_0$, along with the input for all $t \\ge t_0$, are sufficient to uniquely determine the system's behavior for all $t \\ge t_0$.\n\nWhich of the following represents the minimal and complete set of state variables required to describe the thermal state of this two-room system?\n\nA.

The temperature of Room A, $T_A$, the heater power, $P_{in}$, and the ambient temperature, $T_{amb}$.", "solution": "We model each room as a thermal capacitance with heat flows through thermal resistances and an external input to Room A. The fundamental principle is energy balance: for each room, the rate of change of its stored thermal energy equals the net heat inflow. With thermal capacitance $C$ and temperature $T$, the stored energy is $C T$ (up to an additive constant), so the dynamics follow $C \\frac{dT}{dt} =$ net heat inflow.\n\nThe conductive heat flow from node $i$ at temperature $T_{i}$ to node $j$ at temperature $T_{j}$ through thermal resistance $R_{ij}$ is given by\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{i\\to j}=\\frac{T_{i}-T_{j}}{R_{ij}}.\n$$\nTaking inflows as positive for each room and noting that the heater injects $P_{in}(t)$ into Room A, while the ambient is at constant $T_{amb}$, we write:\n\nFor Room A:\n$$\nC_{A}\\frac{dT_{A}}{dt}\n= P_{in}(t) + \\frac{T_{B}-T_{A}}{R_{AB}} + \\frac{T_{amb}-T_{A}}{R_{A,amb}}.\n$$\n\nFor Room B:\n$$\nC_{B}\\frac{dT_{B}}{dt}\n= \\frac{T_{A}-T_{B}}{R_{AB}} + \\frac{T_{amb}-T_{B}}{R_{B,amb}}.\n$$\n\nThese are first-order differential equations in the two variables $T_{A}$ and $T_{B}$, driven by the input $P_{in}(t)$ and the constant parameter $T_{amb}$. In state-space form with state vector $x=\\begin{pmatrix}T_{A} \\\\ T_{B}\\end{pmatrix}$ and input $u=P_{in}(t)$, they can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix}T_{A} \\\\ T_{B}\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{1}{C_{A}R_{AB}}-\\frac{1}{C_{A}R_{A,amb}} & \\frac{1}{C_{A}R_{AB}} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{C_{B}R_{AB}} & -\\frac{1}{C_{B}R_{AB}}-\\frac{1}{C_{B}R_{B,amb}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}T_{A} \\\\ T_{B}\\end{pmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{C_{A}} \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} u\n+\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{C_{A}R_{A,amb}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{C_{B}R_{B,amb}}\\end{pmatrix} T_{amb}.\n$$\n\nFrom these equations, the system order equals the number of independent energy storage elements, which is two (one per room). Therefore, the minimal and complete set of state variables is precisely the pair of room temperatures $T_{A}$ and $T_{B}$. The heater power $P_{in}(t)$ is an input, not a state; the ambient temperature $T_{amb}$ is a constant parameter (or, at most, an exogenous input if time-varying), not a dynamic state; and the derivatives $\\frac{dT_{A}}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dT_{B}}{dt}$ are determined by the current states and inputs, hence are not states themselves. Consequently, among the options, the minimal complete set is $T_{A}$ and $T_{B}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1614475"}, {"introduction": "Once you understand how to identify state variables conceptually, the next step is to construct a mathematical state-space model from physical laws.
