Substituting this into the output equation yields:\n$$\nY(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + DU(s) = \\left( C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D \\right) U(s)\n$$\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ is the ratio $Y(s)/U(s)$, hence:\n$$\nG(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D\n$$\nWe first compute the matrix $(sI - A)^{-1}$:\n$$\nsI - A = \\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & s \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s-2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s+1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & s+3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $sI - A$ is a diagonal matrix, its inverse is simply the matrix of reciprocal diagonal elements:\n$$\n(sI - A)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s+1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{s+3} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we perform the matrix multiplication $C(sI-A)^{-1}B$.

Since both poles have strictly negative real parts, they lie in the open left-half of the complex plane. Consequently, the input-output system described by $G(s)$ is asymptotically stable.\n\nHowever, the internal stability of the system is determined by the eigenvalues of the state matrix $A$. Since $A$ is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 2$, $\\lambda_2 = -1$, and $\\lambda_3 = -3$. These are the system's modes.\nThe set of transfer function poles is $\\{\\text{-}1, \\text{-}3\\}$, which is a proper subset of the set of system eigenvalues $\\{2, \\text{-}1, \\text{-}3\\}$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 2$ is not represented as a pole of $G(s)$. This signifies that a pole-zero cancellation has occurred during the computation of the transfer function. The dynamic mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=2$ is therefore either uncontrollable or unobservable (or both), making it \"hidden\" from an input-output perspective.\nCrucially, since $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 2 > 0$, this hidden mode is unstable. The existence of an unstable eigenvalue means the overall system is not internally asymptotically stable, despite the stability of its transfer function.\n\n**3) Controllability and Observability Analysis**\n\nWe assess controllability and observability for the $n=3$ system.\n\nFor controllability, we form the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B & AB & A^2B \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA^2B = A(AB) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -3 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first row of $\\mathcal{C}$ is a zero vector, which immediately implies that the matrix is rank-deficient. The rank of $\\mathcal{C}$ is $2$, which is less than the system order $n=3$. Therefore, the system is not controllable. The zero first row corresponds to the first state variable, $x_1$, which is associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=2$. This mode is uncontrollable.\n\nFor observability, we form the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C^T & A^T C^T & (A^T)^2 C^T \\end{pmatrix}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\nCA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nCA^2 = (CA)A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first column of $\\mathcal{O}$ is a zero vector, meaning the matrix is rank-deficient. The rank of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $2$, which is less than $n=3$. Therefore, the system is not observable. The zero first column indicates that changes in the first state variable, $x_1$, have no effect on the output. The mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=2$ is unobservable.\n\nThe state component corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=2$ is confirmed to be both uncontrollable and unobservable.\n\n**4) Minimal Realization and Internal Stability**\n\nA minimal realization of a transfer function is one that is both completely controllable and completely observable. It only represents the dynamics that connect the input to the output. Given that the mode at $\\lambda_1=2$ is both uncontrollable and unobservable, it can be removed to form the minimal realization.\nThe original system states $x_2$ and $x_3$ correspond to the controllable and observable subsystem. We construct the minimal realization by taking the parts of the matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to these two states.\nThe state matrix of the minimal realization, $A_{min}$, is:\n$$\nA_{min} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe corresponding input and output matrices are $B_{min} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $C_{min} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The transfer function of this minimal realization $(A_{min}, B_{min}, C_{min}, D)$ is identical to $G(s)$ derived previously. The eigenvalues of $A_{min}$ are $\\{-1, -3\\}$, both of which are stable. This minimal realization is therefore internally asymptotically stable.\n\nHowever, the internal stability of the *original* realization is dictated by the eigenvalues of the original matrix $A = \\operatorname{diag}(2, -1, -3)$. Due to the presence of the eigenvalue $\\lambda = 2$ in the right-half plane, the original system is internally unstable. The unstable dynamic is completely decoupled from both the input and the output, a fact that explains the pole-zero cancellation.\n\n**5) Unstable Internal Eigenvalue**\n\nThe internal dynamics of the system are governed by the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$. The eigenvalues are $\\{2, -1, -3\\}$. An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ corresponds to an unstable mode if its real part is non-negative, $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda) \\geq 0$. In this case, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 2$ satisfies this condition. This is the unstable internal eigenvalue that is masked by the pole-zero cancellation in the transfer function $G(s)$. The numerical value is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2713329"}]}
