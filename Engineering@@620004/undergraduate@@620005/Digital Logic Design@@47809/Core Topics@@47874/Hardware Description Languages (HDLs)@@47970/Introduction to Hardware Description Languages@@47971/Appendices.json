If `d[2]` is '1', the output `{v, y}` must be `3'b110`.\n    This forms the first nesting: `d[3] ? 3'b111 : (d[2] ? 3'b110 : ...)`\n\n3.  **Check `d[1]`:** If both `d[3]` and `d[2]` are '0', we check `d[1]`. If `d[1]` is '1', the output `{v, y}` must be `3'b101`.\n    The nesting continues: `... : (d[2] ? 3'b110 : (d[1] ? 3'b101 : ...))`\n\n4.  **Check the lowest priority input, `d[0]`:** If `d[3]`, `d[2]`, and `d[1]` are all '0', we check `d[0]`. If `d[0]` is '1', the output `{v, y}` must be `3'b100`.\n    The nesting becomes: `... : (d[1] ? 3'b101 : (d[0] ? 3'b100 : ...))`\n\n5.  **Default case:** If all inputs are '0', none of the conditions are met. This is the final `else` case. The output `{v, y}` must be `3'b000`.\n    The full statement is: `assign {v, y} = d[3] ? 3'b111 : d[2] ? 3'b110 : d[1] ? 3'b101 : d[0] ? 3'b100 : 3'b000;`\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A: `assign {v, y} = d[3] ? 3'b111 : d[2] ? 3'b110 : d[1] ? 3'b101 : d[0] ? 3'b100 : 3'b000;`**\n    This statement perfectly matches our derived logic. It correctly implements the priority from `d[3]` down to `d[0]` and produces the correct `{v, y}` values for each case, including the default case. This is the correct answer.\n\n*   **B: `assign {v, y} = d[0] ? 3'b100 : d[1] ? 3'b101 : d[2] ? 3'b110 : d[3] ? 3'b111 : 3'b000;`**\n    This statement reverses the priority order, checking `d[0]` first. It implements a priority encoder where `d[0]` has the highest priority, which contradicts the problem specification.\n\n*   **C: `assign {v, y} = d[3] ? 3'b111 : d[2] ? 3'b110 : d[1] ? 3'b110 : d[0] ? 3'b100 : 3'b000;`**\n    This statement has an error in the output for the `d[1]` case. It outputs `3'b110` when `d[1]` is asserted (and `d[3]`, `d[2]` are not), which corresponds to `{v=1, y=2'b10}`. The correct output should be `{v=1, y=2'b01}` or `3'b101`.\n\n*   **D: `assign {v, y} = d[3] ? 3'b111 : d[2] ? 3'b110 : d[1] ? 3'b101 : d[0] ? 3'b100 : 3'b100;`**\n    This statement has an error in the final `else` (default) case. If no inputs are asserted (`d == 4'b0000`), it assigns `3'b100` to `{v, y}`. This means `v` becomes '1', which is incorrect as the valid bit should be '0' when no inputs are active.\n\n*   **E: `assign {v, y} = d[3] ? 3'b111 : d[2] ? 3'b101 : d[1] ? 3'b011 : d[0] ? 3'b001 : 3'b000;`**\n    This statement appears to be constructed for an assignment to `{y, v}` instead of `{v, y}`. Let's analyze the `d[2]` case: the correct output for `{v, y}` is `3'b110`. This statement provides `3'b101`, which would mean `v=1, y=2'b01`. This corresponds to an index of 1, not 2. However, if the target were `{y, v}`, the value would be `{2'b10, 1'b1}`, which is `3'b101`.
