Both outputs, $Q_F$ and $Q_L$, are initially low (0).\n\n**Analysis of the Positive-Edge-Triggered D-Flip-Flop ($Q_F$)**\n\nA positive-edge-triggered D-flip-flop only updates its output $Q_F$ to the value of the data input $D$ at the precise moment the clock signal $CLK$ transitions from low to high (a rising edge). At all other times, its output remains unchanged.\n\nFirst, we identify the times of the rising edges of the $CLK$ signal. Based on the description, the rising edges occur at $t=2$, $t=6$, and $t=10$.\n\nLet's analyze the state of $Q_F$ chronologically:\n- **Initial State:** For $0 \\leq t  2$, $Q_F$ is in its initial low state. $Q_F = 0$.\n- **At $t=2$ (first rising edge):** We check the value of $D$ at this instant. For the interval $0 \\leq t  3$, $D$ is high (1). Therefore, at $t=2$, $D=1$. The flip-flop's output $Q_F$ updates to match $D$, so $Q_F$ becomes high (1).\n- **Interval $2 \\leq t  6$:** After the rising edge at $t=2$, $Q_F$ holds its value of 1 until the next rising edge. Changes in $D$ during this time do not affect $Q_F$. So, $Q_F = 1$.\n- **At $t=6$ (second rising edge):** We check the value of $D$ at $t=6$. For the interval $5 \\leq t  7$, $D$ is high (1). Therefore, at $t=6$, $D=1$. The output $Q_F$ updates to match $D$. Since $Q_F$ was already 1, it remains 1.\n- **Interval $6 \\leq t  10$:** $Q_F$ holds its value of 1 until the next rising edge. So, $Q_F = 1$.\n- **At $t=10$ (third rising edge):** We check the value of $D$ at $t=10$. For the interval $9 \\leq t  11$, $D$ is high (1). Therefore, at $t=10$, $D=1$. The output $Q_F$ updates to match $D$ and remains 1.\n- **Interval $10 \\leq t  12$:** $Q_F$ holds its value of 1. So, $Q_F = 1$.\n\n**Summary for $Q_F$**: The output $Q_F$ is low for the interval $0 \\leq t  2$ and becomes high at $t=2$. It then remains high for the rest of the observed interval, i.e., for $2 \\leq t  12$.\n\n**Analysis of the High-Level-Sensitive D-Latch ($Q_L$)**\n\nA high-level-sensitive D-latch has two modes of operation:\n1.  **Transparent Mode:** When $CLK$ is high, the latch is \"transparent,\" meaning its output $Q_L$ continuously follows the data input $D$. So, $Q_L(t) = D(t)$.\n2.  **Hold Mode:** When $CLK$ is low, the latch is \"closed\" and holds the last value $D$ had just before the $CLK$ signal transitioned from high to low.\n\nLet's analyze the state of $Q_L$ chronologically:\n- **Interval $0 \\leq t  2$:** $CLK$ is low. The latch is in hold mode. It holds its initial value, which is low (0). So, $Q_L = 0$.\n- **Interval $2 \\leq t  4$:** $CLK$ is high. The latch is transparent. $Q_L$ follows $D$.\n    - For $2 \\leq t  3$, $D$ is high. Thus, $Q_L = 1$.\n    - For $3 \\leq t  4$, $D$ is low. Thus, $Q_L = 0$.\n- **Interval $4 \\leq t  6$:** $CLK$ is low. The latch enters hold mode at $t=4$. It holds the last value of $Q_L$ from just before $t=4$. At $t \\to 4^-$, $Q_L$ was 0. So, for this interval, $Q_L = 0$.\n- **Interval $6 \\leq t  8$:** $CLK$ is high. The latch is transparent again. $Q_L$ follows $D$.\n    - For $6 \\leq t  7$, $D$ is high. Thus, $Q_L = 1$.\n    - For $7 \\leq t  8$, $D$ is low. Thus, $Q_L = 0$.\n- **Interval $8 \\leq t  10$:** $CLK$ is low. The latch holds the value from $t \\to 8^-$, which was 0. So, $Q_L = 0$.\n- **Interval $10 \\leq t  12$:** $CLK$ is high. The latch is transparent. $Q_L$ follows $D$.\n    - For $10 \\leq t  11$, $D$ is high. Thus, $Q_L = 1$.\n    - For $11 \\leq t  12$, $D$ is low. Thus, $Q_L = 0$.\n\n**Summary for $Q_L$**: The output $Q_L$ is high only when $CLK$ is high *and* $D$ is high. This occurs on the intervals $2 \\leq t  3$, $6 \\leq t  7$, and $10 \\leq t  11$. At all other times in the interval $0 \\leq t  12$, $Q_L$ is low.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived waveforms with the choices:\n- $Q_F$ is low for $0 \\leq t  2$ and high for $2 \\leq t  12$.\n- $Q_L$ is high on the intervals $2 \\leq t  3$, $6 \\leq t  7$, and $10 \\leq t  11$, and low otherwise.\n\nThis matches the description in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1944295"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple D-type devices, other sequential elements like the SR latch and JK flip-flop reveal important design trade-offs and historical evolution.

You will investigate why the condition $S=1, R=1$ creates a hazardous, unpredictable state in an SR latch, while the equivalent $J=1, K=1$ condition is a well-defined and useful 'toggle' operation in a JK flip-flop, illustrating a key reason for the latter's widespread use.", "problem": "In digital logic design, understanding the behavior of sequential circuits under different input conditions is critical. Consider two common memory elements: a gated Set-Reset (SR) latch and a positive-edge-triggered JK flip-flop.\n\nThe gated SR latch is level-triggered. Its outputs can change only when its clock input, CLK, is at logic 1. Its behavior is defined by inputs S (Set) and R (Reset).\nThe JK flip-flop is positive-edge-triggered. Its output can change only at the precise moment its clock input, CLK, transitions from logic 0 to logic 1. Its behavior is defined by inputs J and K.\n\nBoth devices are initialized to the reset state, where their primary output Q is at logic 0. They are then subjected to the same single clock pulse. This pulse starts at logic 0, rises to logic 1, remains at logic 1 for a duration $T_{pulse}$, and then falls back to logic 0.\n\nThroughout this entire process, the inputs to the SR latch are held constant at $S=1$ and $R=1$. Simultaneously, the inputs to the JK flip-flop are held constant at $J=1$ and $K=1$.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the behavior of the output $Q_{SR}$ of the SR latch and the final state of the output $Q_{JK}$ of the JK flip-flop after the clock pulse is complete?\n\nA. $Q_{SR}$ stably transitions to 1 while the clock is high.

During the entire pulse, the SR latch has $S=1$ and $R=1$, and the JK flip-flop has $J=1$ and $K=1$.\n\nFor the gated SR latch:\n- The device is level-triggered, so its internal latch is enabled only while $CLK=1$. With $S=1$ and $R=1$ applied while enabled, the latch is in the forbidden condition for an active-high SR latch. This simultaneously asserts set and reset to the cross-coupled pair, driving both internal nodes to a non-complementary condition while $CLK=1$. This is not a valid stored state.\n- When the clock falls from $1$ to $0$, the gating disables both $S$ and $R$ simultaneously (both effective inputs go to $0$ at the same instant). At this falling edge, the internal cross-coupled pair is released from the forced condition, and due to symmetrical simultaneous deassertion of set and reset, a race occurs between the two cross-coupled gates. The final latched state after the falling edge is therefore unpredictable and depends on internal skews and delays. Hence, $Q_{SR}$ enters an unstable race condition upon the clock's falling edge, making its final state indeterminate.\n\nFor the positive-edge-triggered JK flip-flop:\n- The device changes output only at the instant of the rising edge of $CLK$. With $J=1$ and $K=1$, the characteristic behavior is toggle at the rising edge. Therefore, at the rising edge,\n$$\nQ_{JK}(t_{r}^{+})=\\overline{Q_{JK}(t_{r}^{-})}=1,\n$$\nsince $Q_{JK}$ was initialized to $0$. Between edges and at the falling edge, the output does not change for a positive-edge-triggered flip-flop. Therefore, after the pulse completes, the final state is $Q_{JK}=1$.\n\nCombining both results, the correct description is that the SR latch enters an unstable race at the falling edge (final state unpredictable), and the JK flip-flop ends in $Q_{JK}=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1944250"}, {"introduction": "In high-speed digital systems, correct logical behavior is only half the battle; signals must also arrive at the right time.

The latch has a hold time requirement of $t_{\\text{hold,L}} = 1.2$ ns, which is defined with respect to the *falling* edge of the clock `CLK`. For this new configuration (REG1 - Logic - L2), calculate the hold time margin at the input of L2.
