The state of the flip-flop at a discrete time step $t$ is represented by $Q(t)$, and its state at the next time step, after a clock pulse, is $Q(t+1)$. The next state $Q(t+1)$ is determined by the flip-flop's inputs and its current state $Q(t)$.\n\nConsider a specific requirement in a circuit's operation where a flip-flop must undergo a state transition from a logic '0' to a logic '1'. That is, its state must change from $Q(t)=0 \\to Q(t+1)=1$.\n\nYour task is to determine the necessary input conditions to achieve this specific transition for two common types of flip-flops: the D (Data) flip-flop and the JK flip-flop. The D flip-flop has a single input, $D$. The JK flip-flop has two inputs, $J$ and $K$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the required input(s) for both flip-flop types to produce the transition $Q(t)=0 \\to Q(t+1)=1$?\n\nA.
