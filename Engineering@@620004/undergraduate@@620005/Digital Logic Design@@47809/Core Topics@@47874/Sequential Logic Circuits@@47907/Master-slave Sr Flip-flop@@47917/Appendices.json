By investigating what happens when this critical component fails, you will gain a profound appreciation for why the master-slave configuration is an effective design.", "problem": "A standard master-slave Set-Reset (SR) flip-flop is constructed from two gated SR latches, named the master and the slave. In its typical configuration, the master latch is enabled by the clock signal, $\\text{CLK}$, while the slave latch is enabled by the inverted clock signal, $\\overline{\\text{CLK}}$. The master latch receives the external $S$ and $R$ inputs, and its outputs ($Q_m$, $\\overline{Q_m}$) are fed into the $S$ and $R$ inputs of the slave latch, respectively. The overall outputs of the flip-flop, $Q$ and $\\overline{Q}$, are the outputs of the slave latch.

The circuit enters a state of oscillation or becomes metastable whenever $\\text{CLK}$ is high, regardless of the $S$ and $R$ inputs.", "solution": "Define the behavior of a gated SR latch with enable input $E$. Let $Q$ be the output and $Q^{+}$ its next value.

Because $E_{M}$ and $E_{S}$ are complementary, the master can be transparent only when the slave is opaque and vice versa. Thus, while $\\text{CLK}=1$, the master follows $(S,R)$ and the slave holds; when $\\text{CLK}$ transitions to $0$, the master holds and the slave becomes transparent, copying the master’s stored state to $Q$. This nonoverlap yields edge-triggered behavior.\n\nWith the inverter bypassed, both enables are tied: $E_{M}=E_{S}=\\text{CLK}$. Analyze by cases:\n\n- If $\\text{CLK}=0$, then $E_{M}=E_{S}=0$, so both latches are opaque. The master holds its state ($Q_m^{+} = Q_m$) and the slave holds its state ($Q^{+} = Q$). Hence the overall output $Q$ holds.\n\n- If $\\text{CLK}=1$, then $E_{M}=E_{S}=1$, so both latches are transparent. The master’s outputs ($Q_m,\\overline{Q_m}$) respond immediately to $(S,R)$ according to the gated SR rules above. The slave’s inputs are $S_{S}=Q_m$ and $R_{S}=\\overline{Q_m}$, so with its enable also high, the slave output $Q$ follows $Q_m$ (subject only to propagation delay). Therefore, while $\\text{CLK}=1$, the overall $Q$ responds to $(S,R)$ exactly as a single gated SR latch would: set if $S=1,R=0$, reset if $S=0,R=1$, hold if $S=R=0$, and invalid if $S=R=1$.\n\nHence the composite loses edge-triggering and reduces to a single level-sensitive gated SR latch that is transparent when $\\text{CLK}=1$ and opaque when $\\text{CLK}=0$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A matches the derived behavior.\n- B is false because transparency requires $\\text{CLK}=1$; when $\\text{CLK}=0$, $Q$ holds.\n- C is false; the circuit is not stuck and responds when enabled.\n- D is false; there is no edge-triggering without complementary enables.\n- E is false; with valid SR inputs the cascaded transparent latches are stable and do not inherently oscillate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1946082"}]}
