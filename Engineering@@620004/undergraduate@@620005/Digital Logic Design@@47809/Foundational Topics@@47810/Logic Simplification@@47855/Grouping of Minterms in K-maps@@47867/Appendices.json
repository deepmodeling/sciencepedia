The minterms are specified in decimal form as:\n$$ F(A, B, C) = \\Sigma m(0, 2, 4, 5, 6) $$\nFor context, a minterm is a product term that contains all variables of the function, and its decimal representation corresponds to the binary value of the input variables (e.g., minterm $m5$ corresponds to input $ABC = 101$).\n\nIn digital logic simplification using a Karnaugh Map (K-map), we group adjacent cells that contain a '1'. A valid group must consist of a rectangular block of $2^k$ cells, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. Adjacency includes wrap-around connections at the edges of the map.
