The alarm is triggered ($F=1$) for specific input combinations from three sensors $A, B, C$. The function is defined by the sum of minterms $F(A, B, C) = \\sum m(1, 6)$.\n\nThe designer uses a Karnaugh map (K-map) to perform the minimization. The map is structured with variable $A$ representing the rows (top row for $A=0$, bottom row for $A=1$) and variables $BC$ representing the columns in Gray code order (00, 01, 11, 10).

Each of $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, and $D'$ is an implicant: for example, $A'$ is true on all minterms with $A=0$, and on those minterms $ABCD=1$ is false, hence $F=(ABCD)'=1$ holds. Similarly for $B'$, $C'$, and $D'$.\n\nA prime implicant is an implicant that cannot be absorbed by any more general implicant of the function. Consider $A'$. The only way to generalize $A'$ by removing literals would be to drop the literal entirely, yielding the constant $1$, but that would cover the minterm $(A,B,C,D)=(1,1,1,1)$ where $F=0$, so $1$ is not an implicant of $F$. Therefore $A'$ is maximal and hence a prime implicant. The same argument applies to $B'$, $C'$, and $D'$. Any product term with more literals, such as $A'B'$, $A'C'$, $A'B'C'$, etc., is contained within one of these single-literal implicants (for instance, $A'B'\\subset A'$), and therefore is not prime.

For $A'$, consider the minterm with $(A,B,C,D)=(0,1,1,1)$; this minterm is covered by $A'$ but not by $B'$, $C'$, or $D'$ since those require $B=0$, $C=0$, or $D=0$, respectively, which do not hold here. Therefore $A'$ is essential. By the same reasoning, the minterms $(1,0,1,1)$, $(1,1,0,1)$, and $(1,1,1,0)$ are uniquely covered by $B'$, $C'$, and $D'$, respectively.
