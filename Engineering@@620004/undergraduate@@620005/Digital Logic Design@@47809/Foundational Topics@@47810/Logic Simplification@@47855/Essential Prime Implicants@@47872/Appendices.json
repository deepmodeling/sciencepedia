This practice problem uses a simple 2-variable Karnaugh map, allowing you to clearly visualize the process of grouping minterms and identifying which groups are a necessary part of the final simplified expression. Mastering this basic case is the first crucial step toward optimizing more complex digital circuits [@problem_id:1974400].", "problem": "A digital logic circuit is described by the Boolean function $F(A,B) = \\Sigma m(0,1,2)$, where $A$ and $B$ are the input variables and the expression is given in sum-of-minterms canonical form.

A Prime Implicant is a product term that cannot be simplified further (i.e., it represents a maximal grouping of 1s on a Karnaugh map). An Essential Prime Implicant is a Prime Implicant that covers at least one minterm of the function that no other Prime Implicant can cover.\n\nBased on a Karnaugh map analysis of the function $F(A,B)$, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA.

The function has two Prime Implicants, $A'$ and $B'$, but neither is an Essential Prime Implicant.", "solution": "The problem asks us to analyze the Boolean function $F(A,B) = \\Sigma m(0,1,2)$ to find its prime implicants and determine which of them are essential. We will use a Karnaugh map (K-map) for this two-variable function.\n\nStep 1: Construct the K-map.\nA 2-variable K-map has $2^2 = 4$ cells, corresponding to the four possible minterms ($m_0, m_1, m_2, m_3$). The variables are $A$ and $B$. We can arrange the map as follows, where the rows correspond to values of $A$ and columns correspond to values of $B$.\n\nThe minterms are:\n$m_0 = A'B'$ (for A=0, B=0)\n$m_1 = A'B$ (for A=0, B=1)\n$m_2 = AB'$ (for A=1, B=0)\n$m_3 = AB$ (for A=1, B=1)\n\nThe function is $F(A,B) = \\Sigma m(0,1,2)$. We place a '1' in the cells corresponding to minterms $m_0, m_1,$ and $m_2$.\n\nThe K-map is:\n```\n      B=0   B=1\n      ---   ---\nA=0 |  1  |  1  |\n      ---   ---\nA=1 |  1  |  0  |\n      ---   ---\n```\nOr, in terms of minterm indices:\n```\n      B=0   B=1\n      ---   ---\nA=0 | m0  | m1  |\n      ---   ---\nA=1 | m2  | m3  |\n      ---   ---\n```\n\nStep 2: Identify all Prime Implicants (PIs).\nA Prime Implicant (PI) corresponds to the largest possible rectangular group of 1s (where the number of 1s in a group must be a power of 2, e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8...). We look for all such maximal groupings.\n\nGroup 1: We can group the two '1's in the top row (minterms $m_0$ and $m_1$).\nIn this group, $A=0$ is constant, while $B$ changes from 0 to 1. The variable $B$ is eliminated. The term for this group is $A'$.\nThis is a prime implicant because this group of two cannot be combined with any other adjacent '1's to form a larger valid group.\n\nGroup 2: We can group the two '1's in the left column (minterms $m_0$ and $m_2$).\nIn this group, $B=0$ is constant, while $A$ changes from 0 to 1. The variable $A$ is eliminated. The term for this group is $B'$.\nThis is a prime implicant because this group of two cannot be combined with any other adjacent '1's to form a larger valid group.\n\nThere are no other possible maximal groupings. For example, the '1' at $m_0$ is an implicant, but it is not a *prime* implicant because it is part of larger groups ($A'$ and $B'$).\nTherefore, the function has two Prime Implicants: $PI_1 = A'$ and $PI_2 = B'$.\n\nStep 3: Identify the Essential Prime Implicants (EPIs).\nAn Essential Prime Implicant (EPI) is a PI that covers at least one minterm that no other PI covers. We check each minterm of the function ($m_0, m_1, m_2$) to see which PIs cover it.\n\n- $m_0 (A'B')$ is covered by both $PI_1 (A')$ and $PI_2 (B')$.\n- $m_1 (A'B)$ is covered only by $PI_1 (A')$.\n- $m_2 (AB')$ is covered only by $PI_2 (B')$.\n\nNow, let's analyze each PI:\n- To determine if $PI_1 (A')$ is essential, we look at the minterms it covers: $m_0$ and $m_1$. Is there any minterm here that is *not* covered by any other PI? Yes, $m_1$ is only covered by $A'$. Therefore, $A'$ is an Essential Prime Implicant.\n- To determine if $PI_2 (B')$ is essential, we look at the minterms it covers: $m_0$ and $m_2$. Is there any minterm here that is *not* covered by any other PI? Yes, $m_2$ is only covered by $B'$. Therefore, $B'$ is an Essential Prime Implicant.\n\nConclusion: The function has two Prime Implicants, $A'$ and $B'$, and both of them are Essential Prime Implicants.\n\nStep 4: Compare with the given options.\n- A. The function has two Prime Implicants, $A'$ and $B'$. Only $A'$ is an Essential Prime Implicant. (Incorrect)\n- B. The function has two Prime Implicants, $A'$ and $B'$. Both are Essential Prime Implicants. (Correct)\n- C. The function has three Prime Implicants: $A'$, $B'$, and $A'B'$. All three are Essential Prime Implicants. (Incorrect, $A'B'$ is not a prime implicant)\n- D. The function has two Prime Implicants, $A'$ and $B'$. Only $B'$ is an Essential Prime Implicant. (Incorrect)\n- E. The function has two Prime Implicants, $A'$ and $B'$, but neither is an Essential Prime Implicant.

This exercise demonstrates how these don't-cares are not just ignored, but can be strategically used to create larger groupings on a K-map, leading to simpler logic. You will explore how including a single don't-care can form a new essential prime implicant, a powerful technique for circuit optimization [@problem_id:1933992].", "problem": "A 3-variable Boolean function is defined by the sum of minterms $F(A, B, C) = \\sum m(1, 5, 6)$, where A is the most significant bit.

Minterm $m(6)$ cannot combine with $m(1)$ or $m(5)$ (they differ in more than one variable), so it remains as $ABC'$, which is also a prime implicant. Thus, the original prime implicants are $B'C$ and $ABC'$.\n\nNow we allow the don't-care $m(7)$ to be used in grouping. This creates new adjacencies:\n$$\nm(5)+m(7)=AB'C+ABC=AC(B'+B)=AC,\n$$\n$$\nm(6)+m(7)=ABC'+ABC=AB(C'+C)=AB.\n$$\nHence, with the don't-care, the prime implicants become $B'C$, $AC$, and $AB$ (note $ABC'$ is subsumed by $AB$ and is no longer prime).\n\nWe determine essentiality with respect to covering the original minterms $\\{1,5,6\\}$:\n- $m(1)$ is covered only by $B'C$ (neither $AC$ nor $AB$ apply), so $B'C$ is essential.\n- $m(5)$ is covered by both $B'C$ and $AC$, so it does not force essentiality.\n- $m(6)$ is covered only by $AB$, so $AB$ is essential.\n\nAmong these, the essential prime implicant that did not exist as an implicant before using the don't-care is $AB$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1933992"}, {"introduction": "After identifying essential prime implicants, the next step is often to handle the remaining minterms.
