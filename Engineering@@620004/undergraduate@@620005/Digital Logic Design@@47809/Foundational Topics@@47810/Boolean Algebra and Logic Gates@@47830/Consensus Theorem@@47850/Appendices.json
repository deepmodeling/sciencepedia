The theorem allows for the removal of the consensus term $YZ$ **only if it is present** in a three-term expression $XY + X'Z + YZ$.

Identify the variable that appears in its normal and complemented form. This is the variable $A$ (which appears as $A$ in $ACD$ and $A'$ in $A'B'D$). So, $X=A$.\n2.  Identify the remaining parts of the two terms.\n    -   In the term $ACD$ (form $XY$), the remaining part is $Y = CD$.\n    -   In the term $A'B'D$ (form $X'Z$), the remaining part is $Z = B'D$.\n3.  Calculate the consensus term, $YZ$.\n    -   $YZ = (CD)(B'D) = B'CDD = B'CD$.\n\nThe actual consensus of $A'B'D$ and $ACD$ is $B'CD$.

The consensus theorem could be used to *add* the term $B'CD$ to the expression ($A'B'D + ACD = A'B'D + ACD + B'CD$), but it cannot be used to remove $ACD$.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental error is that the student has misidentified the consensus term. The correct consensus is $B'CD$, whereas the student treated $ACD$ as the term to be removed.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n-   A is incorrect. The presence of a common literal ($D$) does not invalidate the theorem. In fact, it becomes part of the consensus term.\n-   B is a true statement (removing $ACD$ is incorrect), but it describes the *result* of the error, not the error in reasoning itself. C is more precise about the specific mistake in applying the theorem.\n-   D is incorrect. The consensus theorem applies to any sum-of-products expression, not just canonical forms.\n-   E is incorrect.
