The region that is inside set A but outside set B.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the region on a Venn diagram that corresponds to the Boolean expression $F = A' + B'$. Let's break down this expression and relate it to set theory operations on a Venn diagram.\n\nThe Venn diagram consists of a universal set U (represented by a rectangle) and two overlapping circles representing sets A and B.\n- Set A: The region inside circle A. This corresponds to the condition where sensor A is TRUE.\n- Set B: The region inside circle B. This corresponds to the condition where sensor B is TRUE.\n\nThe expression involves two main components, $A'$ and $B'$, connected by an OR operator (+).\n\nStep 1: Interpret the NOT operator (').\nThe expression $A'$ (read as \"A-prime\" or \"NOT A\") represents the complement of set A. This includes all elements within the universal set U that are *not* in set A. In the diagram, this is the entire area outside of circle A.\nSimilarly, the expression $B'$ (\"NOT B\") represents the complement of set B. This is the entire area outside of circle B.\n\nStep 2: Interpret the OR operator (+).\nThe OR operator corresponds to the union of sets in set theory. Therefore, the expression $A' + B'$ is equivalent to the set operation $A' \\cup B'$. This means we are looking for the region that is in $A'$ OR in $B'$ OR in both.\n\nStep 3: Combine the regions.\nTo find the region for $A' \\cup B'$, we can visualize the union of the two complements:\n- The region for $A'$ is everything outside circle A. This consists of two parts: the part of circle B that does not overlap with A, and the area outside both circles.\n- The region for $B'$ is everything outside circle B. This consists of two parts: the part of circle A that does not overlap with B, and the area outside both circles.\n\nThe union of these two, $A' \\cup B'$, includes all areas covered by either $A'$ or $B'$. Let's analyze the four distinct regions of a two-set Venn diagram:\n1.  **Region inside A only ($A \\cap B'$):** Is it in $A'$? No, because it is in A. Is it in $B'$? Yes, because it is outside B. Since it is in $B'$, it is included in the union $A' \\cup B'$.\n2.  **Region inside B only ($B \\cap A'$):** Is it in $A'$? Yes, because it is outside A. Is it in $B'$? No, because it is in B. Since it is in $A'$, it is included in the union $A' \\cup B'$.\n3.  **Region outside both A and B ($(A \\cup B)'$):** Is it in $A'$? Yes. Is it in $B'$? Yes. Since it is in both, it is included in the union.\n4.  **Region of intersection of A and B ($A \\cap B$):** Is it in $A'$? No. Is it in $B'$? No. Since it is in neither $A'$ nor $B'$, it is *not* included in the union $A' \\cup B'$.\n\nSo, the region for $F = A' + B'$ includes every part of the Venn diagram *except* for the intersection of A and B. This can be described as the complement of the intersection of A and B, which is $(A \\cap B)'$.\n\nStep 4: Match the derived region with the given options.\n- A. The region of intersection between set A and set B ($A \\cap B$). This is the only region *excluded* from our result. Incorrect.\n- B. The region outside of both set A and set B ($(A \\cup B)'$). This is only a part of our result. Incorrect.\n- C. The union of set A and set B ($A \\cup B$). This is incorrect.\n- D. The entire universal set U, excluding the region of intersection between set A and set B ($(A \\cap B)'$). This description perfectly matches our derived region. Correct.\n- E. The region that is inside set A but outside set B ($A \\cap B'$). This is only a part of our result. Incorrect.\n\nThe logic follows one of De Morgan's laws, which states that $A' + B' = (AB)'$. In set notation, this is $A' \\cup B' = (A \\cap B)'$. The region for the safety alert to trigger is everywhere except where A and B are simultaneously true.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1974914"}, {"introduction": "Building on the two-variable case, this practice scales up the complexity to a three-variable system, a common scenario in digital logic design.
