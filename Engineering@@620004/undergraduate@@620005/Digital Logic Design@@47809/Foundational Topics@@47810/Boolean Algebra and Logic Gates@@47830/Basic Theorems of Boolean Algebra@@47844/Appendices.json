This practice [@problem_id:1911575] provides an excellent starting point, demonstrating how an expression derived from a real-world safety logic scenario can be dramatically reduced. By methodically applying rules like the distributive and complement laws, we can uncover the core dependency of the system and eliminate redundant logic.", "problem": "In an industrial chemical processing plant, a safety interlock system controls the activation of a mixing motor, represented by the output function $M$. The system's logic is based on two input signals, $A$ and $B$. Signal $A$ is true (logic 1) when the primary reactant tank level is adequate and false (logic 0) otherwise. Signal $B$ is true when a secondary catalyst is present and false when it is not.\n\nThe initial design specification for the motor activation logic is as follows: The motor $M$ should activate if (the primary tank level is adequate OR the catalyst is present) AND (the primary tank level is adequate OR the catalyst is not present).\n\nLet the Boolean variable $A$ represent the state of the primary tank level and $B$ represent the presence of the catalyst. The overbar notation (e.g., $\\bar{B}$) denotes the logical NOT operation. The `+` symbol denotes the logical OR operation, and multiplication (e.g., $XY$) denotes the logical AND operation.\n\nBased on this description, the Boolean expression for the motor activation is $M = (A+B)(A+\\bar{B})$. Your task is to algebraically simplify this expression to its most minimal form using the basic theorems of Boolean algebra.", "solution": "We start from the given Boolean expression for the motor activation:\n$$M=(A+B)(A+\\bar{B}).$$\nApply the distributive law, which states that $(X+Y)(X+Z) = X+YZ$.

A logic '1' from a sensor indicates the parameter is above a critical threshold, while a logic '0' indicates it is at a safe level. The system is designed to trigger a high-level alert only if a majority of the sensors (i.e., at least two) report a '1'.\n\nA junior engineer has proposed a logic circuit for this alert system. The engineer's design is based on the premise that the system should be in a \"safe\" state (output $F=0$) if any pair of sensors reports a \"safe\" state. This logic is captured by the following Product-of-Sums (POS) expression:\n$$F(A, B, C) = (A+B)(B+C)(A+C)$$\nHere, $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the Boolean inputs from the sensors, and $F$ is the final alert output.\n\nYour task is to convert this POS expression into its minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) form using only the fundamental theorems and axioms of Boolean algebra (e.g., distributive, associative, commutative, idempotent laws).
