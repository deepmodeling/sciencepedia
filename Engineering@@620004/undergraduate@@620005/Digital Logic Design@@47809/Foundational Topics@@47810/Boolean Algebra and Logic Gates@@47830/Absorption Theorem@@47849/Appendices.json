The system uses two sensors to ensure safe operation. The first sensor is a pressure mat, which produces a logic signal $A$ that is HIGH (1) when the area is clear and LOW (0) when occupied. The second sensor is on the safety cage door, producing a signal $B$ that is HIGH (1) when the door is closed and LOW (0) when open.\n\nThe robotic arm is halted when a shutdown signal $F$ goes HIGH (1). According to the initial design specification, the shutdown signal $F$ must be HIGH if the pressure mat is occupied, OR if the pressure mat is occupied and the safety cage door is open.\n\nThis logic requirement can be expressed as a Boolean function of $A$ and $B$.

Additionally, as a redundant measure, the system must also shut down if both of the following conditions are met simultaneously: (1) the temperature or the pressure is above its critical threshold, and (2) the manual emergency shutdown override has been activated.\"\n\nYour task is to analyze this specification and derive the simplest possible Boolean expression for the shutdown signal $S(A, B, C)$.
