The fundamental operations are AND (denoted by $\\cdot$), OR (denoted by $+$), and NOT (denoted by an overbar, e.g., $\\bar{A}$).\n\nA student learning about algebraic manipulation makes the following claim: \"In Boolean algebra, just like in ordinary arithmetic, a common factor can be canceled out. Therefore, for any three Boolean variables $A, B,$ and $C$, if the equality $A \\cdot B = A \\cdot C$ holds, then it must logically follow that $B = C$.\"\n\nYour task is to find a counterexample that disproves this claim. A counterexample is a specific assignment of values ($0$ or $1$) to $A, B,$ and $C$ for which the premise ($A \\cdot B = A \\cdot C$) is true, but the conclusion ($B = C$) is false.\n\nWhich of the following assignments of values for the tuple $(A, B, C)$ serves as a valid counterexample to the student's claim?\n\nA. $(1, 1, 0)$\n\nB. $(0, 1, 0)$\n\nC. $(1, 0, 0)$\n\nD. $(1, 0, 1)$", "solution": "We seek $A,B,C\\in\\{0,1\\}$ such that the premise $A\\cdot B = A\\cdot C$ holds while the conclusion $B=C$ is false.\n\nKey observation from Boolean algebra:\n- For any $X\\in\\{0,1\\}$, $0\\cdot X = 0$.\n- Therefore, if $A=0$, then $A\\cdot B = 0 = A\\cdot C$ regardless of the values of $B$ and $C$.\n\nTo make $B\\neq C$, choose $B=1$ and $C=0$.
