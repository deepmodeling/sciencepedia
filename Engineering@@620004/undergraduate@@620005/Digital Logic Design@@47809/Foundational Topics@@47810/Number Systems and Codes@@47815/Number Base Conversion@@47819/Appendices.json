Understanding how to translate binary numbers, the native language of computers, into the decimal system we use daily is a foundational skill. This practice focuses on converting a number with both integer and fractional parts, reinforcing the principle of positional notation where each bit's value is determined by its position relative to the binary point [@problem_id:1948859].", "problem": "In digital systems, measurements from sensors are often represented in binary format before being processed. A custom-built environmental monitor provides its raw output as a mixed binary number, which includes both an integer and a fractional component. For a particular reading, this monitor outputs the value $1101.011_2$. To be used in further calculations by a standard data logging system operating in base-10, this binary value must be converted into its decimal equivalent.\n\nDetermine the decimal equivalent of the binary number $1101.011_2$.

The device's central microcontroller needs to manage two primary independent hardware resources: a set of radio frequency channels for communication and a section of memory for storing sensor data.\n\nThe specifications are as follows:\n1.  The device must be capable of selecting one of $C$ distinct radio frequency channels. The total number of available channels is $C = 150$.\n2.  The device uses a memory module that contains $M$ unique, addressable locations for data logging. The total number of memory locations is $M = 4096$.\n\nTo manage these resources, the microcontroller uses two separate, dedicated hardware registers: a 'Channel Selection Register' to store the identifier of the currently selected channel, and a 'Memory Address Register' to store the address of the memory location being accessed. Each register must be able to hold a unique binary code for every possible state it needs to represent (i.e., every channel or every memory address).\n\nCalculate the minimum total number of binary bits (flip-flops) required to construct both the Channel Selection Register and the Memory Address Register.", "solution": "To represent $N$ distinct states in binary using a register, the minimum number of bits $k$ required is the smallest integer such that $2^{k} \\geq N$, equivalently $k = \\lceil \\log_{2}(N) \\rceil$.
