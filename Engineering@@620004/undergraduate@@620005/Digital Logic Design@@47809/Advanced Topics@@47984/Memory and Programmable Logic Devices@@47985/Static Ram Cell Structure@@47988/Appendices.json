Let the two internal storage nodes be denoted as $Q$ and $\\bar{Q}$. The first inverter, which drives node $Q$, is composed of a PMOS pull-up transistor, $M_{P1}$, and an NMOS pull-down transistor, $M_{N1}$. The input to this first inverter is connected to node $\\bar{Q}$. The second inverter, which drives node $\\bar{Q}$, is composed of a PMOS pull-up transistor, $M_{P2}$, and an NMOS pull-down transistor, $M_{N2}$. The input to this second inverter is connected to node $Q$. The PMOS transistors ($M_{P1}$, $M_{P2}$) connect their respective output nodes to the supply voltage $V_{DD}$ when active, and the NMOS pull-down transistors ($M_{N1}$, $M_{N2}$) connect their respective output nodes to ground (GND) when active. The two NMOS access transistors, controlled by a word line (WL), are used for read/write operations but are inactive (WL is held at a low voltage) in this scenario.\n\nConsider a fault condition where the pull-up PMOS transistor of the first inverter, $M_{P1}$, is permanently stuck-open. This means $M_{P1}$ can never conduct current, regardless of the voltage at its gate. All other transistors in the cell function correctly.

The access transistors are off because the word line is low, so there is no conduction to the bit-lines. The stuck-open fault means $M_{P1}$ provides identically zero current for all biases, i.e., $I_{P1} \\equiv 0$. The conduction conditions are:\n- For an NMOS, on if $V_{GS} \\ge V_{TN}$.\n- For a PMOS, on if $V_{SG} \\ge |V_{TP}|$.\n\nA DC steady state requires constant node voltages, so capacitive currents vanish, and each node’s voltage must be enforced by at least one conducting path consistent with transistor states; a purely floating node cannot be maintained at a nontrivial value in steady state in the presence of leakage.\n\nConsider candidate steady states.\n\nCase 1: $V_{Q} \\approx 0$, $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx V_{DD}$. Then for inverter 1: the input is $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx V_{DD}$, hence $V_{GS,N1} = V_{\\bar{Q}} - V_{Q} \\approx V_{DD} \\ge V_{TN}$, so $M_{N1}$ is on and provides a conducting path that pulls $Q$ to $0$. Since $M_{P1}$ is stuck open, there is no pull-up, but it is not needed because $M_{N1}$ actively enforces $V_{Q} \\approx 0$. For inverter 2: the input is $V_{Q} \\approx 0$, hence $V_{GS,N2} \\approx 0 < V_{TN}$ so $M_{N2}$ is off, while $V_{SG,P2} = V_{DD} - 0 = V_{DD} \\ge |V_{TP}|$ so $M_{P2}$ is on and pulls $\\bar{Q}$ up to $V_{DD}$. There is no path from $V_{DD}$ to ground through a single inverter because in inverter 1 only the NMOS is on and in inverter 2 only the PMOS is on. This is a self-consistent, stable fixed point.\n\nCase 2: $V_{Q} \\approx V_{DD}$, $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx 0$. For inverter 2: with $V_{Q} \\approx V_{DD}$, $V_{GS,N2} \\approx V_{DD} \\ge V_{TN}$, so $M_{N2}$ is on, $M_{P2}$ is off, and $\\bar{Q}$ is pulled to ground, consistent. For inverter 1: with $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx 0$, $V_{GS,N1} \\approx 0 < V_{TN}$ so $M_{N1}$ is off, and $M_{P1}$ is stuck open with $I_{P1} \\equiv 0$. Therefore node $Q$ has no DC pull-up path and no DC pull-down path; it is floating. A DC steady state requires $dV_{Q}/dt = 0$ and that the node voltage be enforced by conduction, which is impossible here. Any leakage current that causes $V_{Q}$ to drop below the threshold for $M_{N2}$ will turn $M_{N2}$ off, after which $M_{P2}$ turns on and drives $V_{\\bar{Q}}$ to $V_{DD}$, which then turns $M_{N1}$ on and drives $V_{Q}$ to $0$, converging to Case 1. Thus Case 2 is not a stable attractor.\n\nBy elimination, the only stable state is $V_{Q} \\approx 0$, $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx V_{DD}$, i.e., the cell stores a logic '0' at $Q$ and a logic '1' at $\\bar{Q}$. This rules out the other options: the state is not indeterminate (C), not oscillatory (D) because there is no active loop gain with alternating conduction to sustain oscillations, and not a static short (E) since in the stable state each inverter has only one device conducting and there is no direct $V_{DD}$-to-GND path.\n\nTherefore the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1963488"}, {"introduction": "An ideal SRAM cell would hold its data perfectly during a read, but in reality, the read operation is a delicate balance of competing currents.

Consider the cell storing a logic '0' at one internal node, denote this node voltage during a read as $V_{x}$ (initially near $0$), while the complementary node is near $V_{DD}$. During a read, both bitlines are precharged to $V_{DD}$ and the wordline is asserted to $V_{DD}$, turning on the access NMOS connected to the $V_{x}$ node. This creates a contention between:\n- the access NMOS that tends to raise $V_{x}$ toward $V_{DD}$, and\n- the pull-down NMOS of the inverter connected to $V_{x}$ that pulls $V_{x}$ toward $0$.\n\nLet the access NMOS have parameter $k_{ax}$ and threshold $V_{th,ax}$, and the pull-down NMOS have parameter $k_{pd}$ and threshold $V_{th,pd}$.

The cell consists of two cross-coupled CMOS inverters that form a latch to store a single bit, and two NMOS access transistors. The access transistors connect the internal storage nodes, labeled $Q$ and $\\overline{Q}$, to the bit line (BL) and the complementary bit line ($\\overline{\\text{BL}}$), respectively. A word line (WL) controls the gates of both access transistors.\n\nIn a normal read operation, a precharge circuit first actively drives both BL and $\\overline{\\text{BL}}$ to the high supply voltage, $V_{DD}$.

With a failed precharge, both BL and $\\overline{\\text{BL}}$ are floating at $0$ and the read begins with both lines at $0$.\n\nConsider the two cases of stored data.

If $V_{\\text{share}} < V_{\\text{trip}}$, the cross-coupled inverter pair will switch, flipping the cell to $Q = 0$, i.e., a destructive read. The non-destructive condition would require\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{cell}}}{C_{\\text{BL}}} > \\frac{V_{\\text{trip}}}{V_{DD} - V_{\\text{trip}}},\n$$\nwhich is typically not satisfied because $C_{\\text{BL}}$ is designed to be much larger than $C_{\\text{cell}}$.

The side storing $0$ remains near $0$, offering no useful discharging action on a precharged line; instead, the cell must source current to raise the opposite bit line from $0$, which is slow.\n\nSense amplifier behavior and timing: Because both bit lines start at $0$, the cell must actively pull one line up from $0$ through a weak PMOS plus access path while the other side remains near $0$. This produces a differential only after a significant delay, and the initial charge-sharing event dangerously disturbs the stored node that was at $V_{DD}$. Depending on device ratios and timing (e.g., when the sense amplifier is enabled and how long WL is asserted), the read might occasionally yield the correct value, but there is a high likelihood of corrupting the cell content (destructive read), and the development of any usable differential is much slower than in a normal precharged read.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the read might produce the correct value, but it is highly likely to corrupt the stored data and will be significantly slower than a normal read operation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1963469"}]}
