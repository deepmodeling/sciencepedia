To improve data throughput, the memory is designed to be accessed in 8-bit words.

Building on your understanding of the charge-sharing principle, this thought experiment explores a critical fault scenario where this rule is broken. By analyzing what happens when two cells on the same bitline are accessed simultaneously, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why DRAM controllers must be meticulously designed to prevent data corruption [@problem_id:1930990].", "problem": "In a simplified model of a Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) array, each memory cell consists of a single access transistor and a single storage capacitor (a 1T1C cell). The rows of the array are addressed by wordlines (WL), and the columns are addressed by bitlines (BL). To read a cell, its corresponding wordline is asserted (driven to a high voltage), which turns on the access transistor and connects the storage capacitor to its corresponding bitline. Prior to the read, the bitline is pre-charged to a voltage of $V_{pre} = V_{DD}/2$, where $V_{DD}$ is the supply voltage. A sense amplifier then detects the small voltage change on the bitline to determine if the capacitor was storing a logic '1' (charged to approximately $V_{DD}$) or a logic '0' (discharged to 0 V).\n\nConsider a scenario involving a faulty memory controller. This controller erroneously asserts two distinct wordlines, WL_A and WL_B, simultaneously. These two wordlines are connected to two different memory cells, Cell A and Cell B, respectively. Both Cell A and Cell B are connected to the exact same bitline, BL_C.\n\nAt the moment the fault occurs, Cell A (on WL_A) is storing a logic '1', meaning its capacitor is charged to $V_{DD}$. At the same time, Cell B (on WL_B) is storing a logic '0', meaning its capacitor is essentially discharged (0 V). Assume the capacitance of the storage capacitor in each cell is $C_S$, and the total capacitance of the bitline is $C_{BL}$. For this analysis, assume $C_{BL}$ is significantly larger than $C_S$.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence of simultaneously asserting WL_A and WL_B?\n\nA. The bitline's sense amplifier will randomly read either the '1' from Cell A or the '0' from Cell B, and the stored data in both cells will be preserved.\n\nB. A direct short circuit is created between the power supply ($V_{DD}$) and ground through the two cells, causing immediate and permanent damage to the transistors.\n\nC. The two cells effectively fight each other, driving the bitline voltage to an intermediate level that is neither a valid '1' nor a valid '0', leading to a corrupted read and the loss of data in Cell A.\n\nD. Since the bitline capacitance $C_{BL}$ is much larger than the cell capacitance $C_S$, the bitline voltage remains essentially unchanged at $V_{DD}/2$, and no data can be read from either cell.\n\nE. The bitline voltage will be pulled down to 0 V because the discharged capacitor in Cell B acts as a sink, absorbing all charge from both the bitline and Cell A.", "solution": "Model each nodeâ€™s voltage and charge with respect to ground and use charge conservation when the access transistors of Cell A and Cell B are simultaneously turned on, shorting their storage capacitors to the same bitline.\n\nBefore the fault:\n- The bitline is precharged to $V_{BL,i}=V_{DD}/2$, with charge $Q_{BL,i}=C_{BL}\\left(V_{DD}/2\\right)$.\n- Cell A stores a logic '1', so its capacitor is at $V_{A,i}=V_{DD}$, with charge $Q_{A,i}=C_{S}V_{DD}$.\n- Cell B stores a logic '0', so its capacitor is at $V_{B,i}=0$, with charge $Q_{B,i}=0$.\n\nWhen WL_A and WL_B are asserted together, the bitline node and both storage capacitors are connected in parallel to a common node.

This voltage is neither a valid stored '1' nor '0' for a DRAM cell, so Cell A loses its stored '1' (and Cell B no longer holds a '0'). The sense amplifier sees no useful differential (no deviation from precharge), leading to a corrupted read; if subsequently enabled, it may latch arbitrarily due to offsets and then overwrite both cells, but the immediate effect is the intermediate level and loss of the original content in Cell A.\n\nThis behavior matches the description that the two cells effectively oppose each other, establishing an intermediate bitline level, corrupting the read and destroying the stored '1' in Cell A.
