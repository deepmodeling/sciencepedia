This first practice places you in the role of a hardware engineer debugging a circuit with a quintessential tool: the oscilloscope. By interpreting the visual artifacts created by a metastable flip-flop output, you will learn to recognize its distinct signature, linking the abstract concept of an indeterminate state to a concrete, observable electrical behavior [@problem_id:1947264].", "problem": "A digital systems engineer is debugging a circuit containing a single D-type flip-flop. The data input, labeled `D`, is known to be asynchronous with respect to the clock input, `CLK`. To investigate the circuit's behavior under this condition, the engineer connects an oscilloscope probe to the flip-flop's output, `Q`. The oscilloscope is set to trigger on the rising edge of the `CLK` signal, and a display mode known as \"infinite persistence\" is enabled. This mode causes all captured waveforms to be overlaid on the screen, with the brightness of any point corresponding to how frequently the signal has passed through that point. After running the circuit for several minutes, the engineer must interpret the resulting image on the oscilloscope screen.\n\nWhich of the following textual descriptions of the oscilloscope display provides the most definitive evidence that the flip-flop's output `Q` is experiencing metastability?\n\nA. The display shows a single, clean square wave with a frequency exactly one-half of the `CLK` frequency.\n\nB. The display shows two bright, solid horizontal lines, one at the logic '1' voltage and one at the logic '0' voltage. The transitions between these lines are sharp, vertical, and occur precisely at the trigger time.\n\nC. The display shows two bright, solid horizontal lines at the logic '1' and '0' voltages. Between these two lines, and starting near the trigger time, there is a distinct region of faint, \"glowing\" traces that extend horizontally for a short and variable duration.\n\nD. The display shows a constant, solid horizontal line at the logic '1' voltage, but this line appears thick and fuzzy, indicating rapid, small voltage fluctuations around the '1' level.\n\nE. The display shows a single, sharp horizontal line at a voltage level that is approximately halfway between the defined logic '1' and '0' voltages.", "solution": "We analyze the D-type flip-flop with asynchronous input $D$ relative to the clock $CLK$. Because $D$ is asynchronous, there exists a nonzero probability that $D$ transitions within the setup/hold aperture around the rising edge of $CLK$. When this occurs, the flip-flop can enter a metastable state in which the output $Q$ is neither a valid logic '0' nor a valid logic '1' for a random duration before resolving to a stable level. A standard model for the resolution dynamics is that the metastable node departs from the decision threshold $V_{M}$ according to an exponential with characteristic time constant $\\tau$, so that for some small initial offset $\\Delta V$ the output trajectory takes the form\n$$\nV_{Q}(t)=V_{M}\\pm \\Delta V \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right),\n$$\nwith the eventual sign and rail determined by noise and device imbalances. The distribution of metastability resolution times $t_{\\text{res}}$ is typically modeled with an exponential tail; the probability that the metastability persists beyond time $t$ scales as\n$$\n\\Pr\\!\\left(t_{\\text{res}}>t\\right)\\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right).\n$$\nThus metastability events are relatively rare and their durations are variable, with longer durations exponentially less likely.\n\nThe oscilloscope is triggered on the rising edge of $CLK$ and set to infinite persistence, which overlays many acquisitions so that frequently occurring values appear bright while infrequent values appear faint. Under normal synchronous capture without metastability, $Q$ will be at one of the two logic levels for most of the time, and transitions will occur at well-defined times after the trigger. Hence, infinite persistence will show two bright horizontal lines at the logic rails, with transitions appearing as sharp vertical edges occurring at fixed delays from the trigger.\n\nIf metastability occurs, then near the trigger time (the sampling instant) $Q$ can be at intermediate voltages for a random duration $t_{\\text{res}}$. Over many acquisitions, the infinite-persistence display will therefore accumulate not only the two bright lines at the rails but also a faint “cloud” or “glow” of traces between the rails beginning near the trigger time and extending horizontally for variable lengths that reflect the random $t_{\\text{res}}$. Because long metastable durations have probability proportional to $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$, the density (brightness) of these intermediate traces decreases with increasing horizontal distance from the trigger, and the intermediate levels are sparse compared to the rails, hence faint.\n\nWe now evaluate the options in this context:\n\nA. A single, clean square wave at one-half the $CLK$ frequency indicates that $Q$ is toggling deterministically on each clock edge (as in a divide-by-two behavior) and does not indicate metastability.\n\nB. Two bright rails with sharp vertical transitions precisely at the trigger time indicate consistent, well-timed sampling and no metastability-induced timing dispersion or intermediate levels.\n\nC. Two bright rails plus a distinct, faint region of traces between the rails starting near the trigger time and extending horizontally for a short, variable duration matches exactly the metastability signature: intermediate $Q$ levels near the sampling instant with variable resolution times $t_{\\text{res}}$, accumulated by infinite persistence as a faint, smeared band between rails.\n\nD. A thick, fuzzy line at logic '1' suggests noise or small fluctuations around a stable high level, not the intermediate-level behavior or variable-duration delay characteristic of metastability near the sampling edge.\n\nE. A single sharp mid-level line indicates a constant DC mid-level (for example, a stuck or improperly biased node, probe loading, or a powered-off driver), not sporadic, time-varying metastable behavior.\n\nTherefore, the description that provides the most definitive evidence of metastability is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1947264"}, {"introduction": "Recognizing metastability is the first step; preventing it from causing system failure is the engineer's primary goal.

This final practice explores a critical and common design flaw: the illegal fan-out of a signal before it is fully synchronized.

The synchronizer consists of two serially connected D-type flip-flops, `FF1` and `FF2`. The output of the first flip-flop, `Q1`, is connected to the input of the second, `D2`.\n\nIn a violation of good design practice, the `Q1` output signal is also fanned out to feed the data inputs of two other parallel flip-flops, `FF_A` and `FF_B`. Thus, `D_A = Q1` and `D_B = Q1`. All flip-flops (`FF1`, `FF_A`, and `FF_B`) are driven by the same clock `CLK` with a period of `T_{clk}`.\n\nDue to manufacturing process variations, the logic input thresholds of `FF_A` and `FF_B` are slightly different. `FF_A` interprets its input as logic '1' if the voltage is above `V_{th_A}`, and `FF_B` interprets its input as logic '1' if the voltage is above `V_{th_B}`. You are given that `V_{th_A} < V_{th_B}`.\n\nAt time `t=0`, a rising edge of `CLK` occurs. Just before this edge, the `ASYNC_IN` signal transitions, violating the setup time of `FF1`. This causes `FF1`'s output `Q1` to enter a metastable state. The voltage of `Q1`, denoted `V_{Q1}(t)`, begins to resolve towards the high supply rail `V_{DD}`.
