A common issue is a non-monotonic signal edge, where a signal that is intended to transition cleanly from low to high (or vice-versa) instead exhibits ringing or glitches. This can cause unexpected behavior in receiving logic gates.\n\nConsider an ideal digital inverter whose logic level is determined by a single switching threshold voltage. The inverter is powered by a supply voltage $V_{DD} = 3.3$ V. Its output is logic HIGH (3.3 V) when its input voltage, $V_{in}$, is below the switching threshold $V_T = 1.5$ V. Conversely, its output is logic LOW (0 V) when $V_{in}$ is above $V_T$. Assume the inverter has zero propagation delay and its output transition is instantaneous upon the input crossing the threshold $V_T$.\n\nAn incoming signal, $V_{in}(t)$, is measured at the inverter's input. For time $t < 0$, the input voltage was held at 0 V. Due to distortions on the transmission line, the subsequent rising edge is non-monotonic and can be described by the following piecewise linear function over the time interval from $t=0$ to $t=3$ ns:\n1.

Because $1.4<V_{T}<3.3$, there is exactly one crossing in this interval, hence one output transition (from HIGH to LOW). With $V_{in}(t)=1.4+1.9\\,(t-2)$, the crossing satisfies $1.4+1.9\\,(t-2)=V_{T}$, giving $t=2+\\frac{V_{T}-1.4}{1.9}$ ns.\n\nThere are no crossings exactly at the interval boundaries, since $V_{in}(1\\ \\text{ns})=1.6>V_{T}$ and $V_{in}(2\\ \\text{ns})=1.4<V_{T}$.
