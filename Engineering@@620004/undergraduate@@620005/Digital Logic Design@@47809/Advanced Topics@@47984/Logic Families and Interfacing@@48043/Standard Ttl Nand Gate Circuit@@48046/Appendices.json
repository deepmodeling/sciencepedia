A high-impedance (floating) state", "solution": "The problem asks for the output logic level of a TTL NAND gate with a specific internal fault, given that both of its inputs are held HIGH. The fault is that $R_2$, the collector resistor of the phase-splitter transistor $Q_2$, is an open circuit.\n\nLet's analyze the circuit's behavior stage by stage under these conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input stage ($Q_1$)**\nWhen both inputs of the NAND gate are held at a HIGH logic level (e.g., close to $V_{CC}$), the base-emitter junctions of the input transistor $Q_1$ are reverse-biased. This prevents current from flowing out of the emitters. Instead, current flows from the supply voltage $V_{CC}$, through the base resistor $R_1$, and then through the base-collector junction of $Q_1$, which becomes forward-biased. This configuration is known as reverse-active mode for $Q_1$. The crucial result is that current is delivered to the base of the next transistor, $Q_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the phase-splitter stage ($Q_2$)**\nSince current is flowing into the base of the phase-splitter transistor $Q_2$, it will turn ON. When $Q_2$ turns on, current will flow from its collector and emitter. Let's analyze the two paths separately.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the path through the emitter of $Q_2$**\nThe emitter of $Q_2$ is connected to the base of the lower totem-pole transistor, $Q_4$. The emitter current from $Q_2$ flows into the base of $Q_4$ and also through the emitter resistor $R_3$ to ground. This base current is sufficient to turn $Q_4$ on and drive it into saturation. When $Q_4$ is saturated, it acts like a closed switch connecting the output node to ground. This pulls the output voltage down to $V_{CE,sat}$ of $Q_4$, which is typically around $0.2 \\text{ V}$ to $0.3 \\text{ V}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the path through the collector of $Q_2$**\nThe collector of $Q_2$ is connected to the base of the upper totem-pole transistor, $Q_3$. The fault condition states that the resistor $R_2$, which normally connects the collector of $Q_2$ to $V_{CC}$, is an open circuit. Since $Q_2$ is turned on by its base current (from Step 2), it must have a collector current, $I_{C2} = \\beta I_{B2}$ (assuming it's in the forward-active region, which we'll confirm). With $R_2$ open, there is no path for this collector current to flow from $V_{CC}$. The only available path for the collector current $I_{C2}$ to flow *out* of $Q_2$'s collector is into the base of transistor $Q_3$. Therefore, this collector current becomes the base current for $Q_3$, i.e., $I_{B3} = I_{C2}$. This base current will turn $Q_3$ ON.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the output stage ($Q_3$ and $Q_4$)**\nFrom Step 3, we determined that $Q_4$ is turned ON and is in saturation. From Step 4, we determined that $Q_3$ is also turned ON. When both transistors in a totem-pole output are on simultaneously, a large current (known as a shoot-through current) flows directly from $V_{CC}$ through $Q_3$ and $Q_4$ to ground.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the logic level at the output node. The output node is connected to ground through the saturated transistor $Q_4$. The voltage at this node is therefore clamped to the collector-emitter saturation voltage of $Q_4$, $V_{CE,sat,Q4}$. For a standard TTL transistor, $V_{CE,sat}$ is very low, typically $0.2 \\text{ V}$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nA voltage of $0.2 \\text{ V}$ is well within the defined voltage range for a Logic LOW in the TTL family (where $V_{OL,max}$ is typically $0.4 \\text{ V}$). Therefore, despite both output transistors being on and creating a high-current condition that would likely damage the chip over time, the immediate steady-state voltage at the output represents a valid Logic LOW.\n\nThus, the resulting logic level is LOW.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1961358"}, {"introduction": "Power consumption is a critical constraint in digital design, from small battery-powered devices to large data centers.
