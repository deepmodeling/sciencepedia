Consider a specific PTL implementation of a 2-input XOR gate, $Y = A \\oplus B$, constructed using two Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) transmission gates (TGs).\n\nThe fundamental switching elements are n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (NMOS) and p-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (PMOS) transistors. For the purpose of this digital analysis, assume:\n- An NMOS transistor is in the \"ON\" (conducting) state when its gate terminal is at a high logic level (`1`) and \"OFF\" (non-conducting) when its gate is at a low logic level (`0`).\n- A PMOS transistor is in the \"ON\" (conducting) state when its gate terminal is at a low logic level (`0`) and \"OFF\" (non-conducting) when its gate is at a high logic level (`1`).\n\nA transmission gate (TG) is formed by connecting an NMOS and a PMOS transistor in parallel. The gate of the NMOS is connected to a control signal $C$, and the gate of the PMOS is connected to the complementary control signal $\\bar{C}$. The TG is \"ON\" (passes a signal from its input to its output) only if $C=1$ (and thus $\\bar{C}=0$).\n\nThe XOR gate in question is constructed as follows:\n- **Transmission Gate 1 (TG1):** Comprises an NMOS transistor `N1` and a PMOS transistor `P1`. The input to TG1 is connected to the signal $\\bar{B}$ (the logical NOT of $B$). The gate of `N1` is controlled by signal $A$, and the gate of `P1` is controlled by signal $\\bar{A}$.\n- **Transmission Gate 2 (TG2):** Comprises an NMOS transistor `N2` and a PMOS transistor `P2`. The input to TG2 is connected to the signal $B$. The gate of `N2` is controlled by signal $\\bar{A}$, and the gate of `P2` is controlled by signal $A$.\n- **Output:** The outputs of TG1 and TG2 are connected together to form the final gate output $Y$.\n\nFor the input combination $A=1$ and $B=0$, identify the complete set of transistors that are in the \"ON\" (conducting) state.\n\nA. {N1, P1}\n\nB. {N2, P2}\n\nC. {N1, P2}\n\nD. {N2, P1}\n\nE. {N1, N2, P1, P2}\n\nF. {} (the empty set)", "solution": "We are given two transmission gates (TGs) composed of parallel NMOS and PMOS transistors.
