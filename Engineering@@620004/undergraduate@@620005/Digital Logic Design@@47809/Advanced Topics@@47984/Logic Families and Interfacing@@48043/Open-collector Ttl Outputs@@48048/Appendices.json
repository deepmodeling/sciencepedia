The technician has a high-impedance digital multimeter and can reliably set the input of any chosen inverter to a logic LOW (0 V) or a logic HIGH (+5 V).\n\nWhich of the following test procedures would be a reliable and non-destructive method to distinguish between a totem-pole output and an open-collector output?\n\nA. Set the inverter's input to logic HIGH to produce a logic LOW output. Connect the output pin to the multimeter and measure the voltage. A reading near 0.4 V indicates an open-collector output, while a reading near 0 V indicates a totem-pole output.\n\nB. Set the inverter's input to logic LOW to produce a logic HIGH output.

With no external pull-up, the node is floating, and with a high-impedance meter of resistance $R_{m}$ the voltage is undefined and determined only by leakage currents $i_{\\ell}$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{out}} = i_{\\ell} R_{m},\n$$\nwhich is not guaranteed to be a valid logic HIGH and can be unstable or intermediate.\n\nAnalyze each option:\n\nA.
