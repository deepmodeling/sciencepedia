To achieve this, the plan is to use only the first AND gate (with inputs $A$ and $B$) and disable the second AND gate (with inputs $C$ and $D$). Disabling the second AND gate means its output, the logical term $(C \\cdot D)$, must be permanently forced to a logical 0.

Connect input $C$ to Vcc and input $D$ to ground.", "solution": "The goal is to disable the second AND gate in the 74LS51 AOI structure, which has inputs $C$ and $D$. The logical function of the entire gate is $Y = \\overline{(A \\cdot B) + (C \\cdot D)}$. To make the output dependent only on the first AND gate, the term $(C \\cdot D)$ must be made equal to a logical 0. This simplifies the function to $Y = \\overline{(A \\cdot B) + 0} = \\overline{A \\cdot B}$.\n\nThe property of a logical AND operation is that its output is 0 if at least one of its inputs is 0. Therefore, to ensure $(C \\cdot D) = 0$, we must ensure that either input $C$, input $D$, or both are held at a constant logical 0 state.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option based on this requirement and the standard practices for Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) circuits, specifically the 74LS (low-power Schottky) family.\n\n**Option A: Connect both inputs $C$ and $D$ directly to the Vcc (+5V) supply rail.**\nConnecting an input to Vcc forces it to a logical 1 state. In this case, $C=1$ and $D=1$. The output of the unused AND gate would be $(C \\cdot D) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. This is the opposite of our goal. This configuration would force the term $(A \\cdot B)$ to be irrelevant, as the overall output would become $Y = \\overline{(A \\cdot B) + 1} = \\overline{1} = 0$, regardless of the states of $A$ and $B$. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: Leave both inputs $C$ and $D$ disconnected (floating).**\nTTL inputs have an internal structure that, when left floating, allows them to \"float high\". This is because an input sources a small amount of current, and with no path to ground, the input voltage rises to a level that is interpreted as a logical 1. So, floating inputs on a 74LS chip behave as if they are at a logical 1 state. This leads to $(C \\cdot D) \\approx 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A. Furthermore, leaving TTL inputs floating is considered poor engineering practice because they are susceptible to picking up noise, which can cause erratic behavior and increased power consumption.\n\n**Option C: Connect input $C$ to ground (0V) and leave input $D$ disconnected.**\nConnecting input $C$ to ground correctly forces it to a logical 0 state. As established in Option B, the floating input $D$ will behave as a logical 1. The output of the AND gate would then be $(C \\cdot D) = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$. Logically, this configuration achieves the desired goal. However, it still involves leaving an input ($D$) floating, which is robustly discouraged in digital design for reasons of noise immunity and reliability. Therefore, this is not the most appropriate or robust method.\n\n**Option D: Connect both inputs $C$ and $D$ to ground.**\nConnecting both inputs to ground forces them both to a logical 0 state. The output of the AND gate becomes $(C \\cdot D) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$. This achieves the desired logical goal. Electrically, grounding the inputs provides a low-impedance path, making the inputs immune to noise. This is a stable, reliable, and power-efficient way to fix the inputs to a known state. This is the standard recommended practice for disabling an unused AND or NAND gate in a TTL circuit.\n\n**Option E: Connect input $C$ to Vcc and input $D$ to ground.**\nThis configuration sets $C=1$ and $D=0$. The output of the AND gate becomes $(C \\cdot D) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$. Logically, this achieves the goal. Both inputs are tied to stable voltage rails (Vcc and ground), so it is a robust connection. However, it requires connecting the unused inputs to two different potentials. While technically correct, the method in Option D is simpler as it connects all relevant pins to a single, common potential (ground). For disabling an AND gate, tying all unused inputs to ground is the most common and straightforward convention. Given the choice, Option D is slightly preferred for its simplicity and represents the canonical answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth D and E are logically correct and electrically robust. However, Option D is the most common, simplest, and universally recommended method for disabling an AND/NAND gate in TTL logic. Therefore, it represents the \"most appropriate and robust engineering practice\".", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1973560"}, {"introduction": "Open-collector outputs offer a powerful feature for creating \"wired-logic,\" where multiple outputs can be connected to a single line.
