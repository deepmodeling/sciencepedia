It has two logic inputs, A and B, and one output, Y. The circuit is structured with four transistors: two P-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (PMOS) transistors, designated PA and PB, and two N-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (NMOS) transistors, designated NA and NB.\n\nThe operational principle for these transistors is as follows:\n- An NMOS transistor conducts (is 'ON') when its gate receives a high logic level ('1') and does not conduct (is 'OFF') when its gate receives a low logic level ('0').\n- A PMOS transistor's behavior is inverse: it is 'ON' for a low logic level ('0') at its gate and 'OFF' for a high logic level ('1').\n\nThe specific connections within the gate are described below:\n- The gates of PA and NA are both connected to input A.\n- The gates of PB and NB are both connected to input B.\n- The pull-up network, connected between the power supply (Vdd) and the output Y, consists of transistors PA and PB connected in parallel.\n- The pull-down network, connected between the output Y and ground (GND), consists of transistors NA and NB connected in series.\n\nFor the input condition where A = 1 and B = 0, identify the complete set of transistors that are in the 'ON' state.\n\nA.

A PMOS conducts (is ON) iff its gate input is low, i.e., gate input equals $0$, and does not conduct (is OFF) when its gate input equals $1$.\n\nThe gates of PA and NA are tied to $A$, and the gates of PB and NB are tied to $B$. For the specified inputs $A=1$ and $B=0$:\n- For the pair driven by $A$: $A=1$ implies NA (NMOS) is ON and PA (PMOS) is OFF, since NMOS is ON for $1$ and PMOS is OFF for $1$.\n- For the pair driven by $B$: $B=0$ implies NB (NMOS) is OFF and PB (PMOS) is ON, since NMOS is OFF for $0$ and PMOS is ON for $0$.\n\nTherefore, the complete set of transistors that are ON is $\\{\\text{PB}, \\text{NA}\\}$, which corresponds to option B. The network topology (PMOS in parallel pull-up, NMOS in series pull-down) is consistent: the pull-up path is established through PB (ON) while the pull-down path is broken because NB is OFF.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1921750"}, {"introduction": "A primary advantage of CMOS technology is its potential for low power consumption, a critical factor in everything from mobile devices to massive data centers.
