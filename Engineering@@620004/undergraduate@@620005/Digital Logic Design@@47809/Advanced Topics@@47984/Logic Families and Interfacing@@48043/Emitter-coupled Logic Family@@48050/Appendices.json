Instead of fully switching transistors on and off into saturation, ECL steers a nearly constant current between two alternative paths. This foundational exercise prompts you to identify which circuit component is primarily responsible for converting this steered current into the output voltage swing, a critical step in understanding how ECL gates generate their logic levels. [@problem_id:1932337]", "problem": "Consider a basic Emitter-Coupled Logic (ECL) inverter. The circuit consists of a differential pair of Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. The input signal $V_{in}$ is applied to the base of $Q_1$, while a fixed reference voltage $V_{REF}$ is applied to the base of $Q_2$. The emitters of both transistors are connected together and then to a negative supply voltage $V_{EE}$ through a common emitter resistor, $R_{EE}$. The collector of the input transistor $Q_1$ is connected to the ground supply ($V_{CC} = 0$ V) through a collector resistor, $R_C$. The output of the inverter, $V_{out}$, is taken from the collector of $Q_1$. The collector of the reference transistor $Q_2$ is also connected to ground via another resistor, but its voltage is not used as an output in this configuration.\n\nThe fundamental operation involves steering a nearly constant current, primarily set by $R_{EE}$, through either $Q_1$ or $Q_2$ depending on whether $V_{in}$ is higher or lower than $V_{REF}$. This current steering action causes the output voltage $V_{out}$ to switch between a high level ($V_{OH}$) and a low level ($V_{OL}$). The logic swing is defined as the difference $V_{LS} = |V_{OH} - V_{OL}|$. A key design characteristic of ECL is that the transistors are prevented from entering the saturation region.\n\nBased on an analysis of the circuit's operation, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary role of the resistors $R_C$ and $R_{EE}$ in determining the magnitude of the logic swing, $V_{LS}$?\n\nA. The resistor $R_C$ has the primary role, as the logic swing is fundamentally the change in voltage drop across $R_C$ when the differential pair's current is steered through it.\n\nB. The resistor $R_{EE}$ has the primary role, as it sets the total current for the differential pair, and this current value directly determines the logic swing.\n\nC. Both resistors have an equal primary role, as the logic swing is directly proportional to their ratio, $R_C / R_{EE}$.\n\nD. The resistor $R_{EE}$ has the primary role, as its value is chosen to ensure the transistors operate deep in the saturation region to achieve the fastest possible switching.\n\nE. The resistor $R_C$ has the primary role, as it limits the base current of the input transistor $Q_1$, thereby controlling the switching speed and the logic swing.", "solution": "Let the differential pair share a constant tail current $I_{T}$ set primarily by the emitter network to $V_{EE}$ through $R_{EE}$. For an ECL gate, the transistors are biased to avoid saturation; the differential action steers $I_{T}$ between $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ depending on whether $V_{in}$ is greater or less than $V_{REF}$.\n\nAssume the collector of $Q_{1}$ is tied to $V_{CC}$ through $R_{C}$ and the output is $V_{out}$ at that collector. When $Q_{1}$ is on (and $Q_{2}$ is off), the collector current of $Q_{1}$ is approximately the tail current:\n$$\nI_{C1,\\text{ON}} \\approx I_{T}.\n$$\nWhen $Q_{1}$ is off (and $Q_{2}$ is on), the collector current through $R_{C}$ is ideally near zero (neglecting small leakage and finite gain sharing), so\n$$\nI_{C1,\\text{OFF}} \\approx 0.\n$$\nTherefore, the output levels at the collector of $Q_{1}$ are\n$$\nV_{OL} = V_{CC} - I_{C1,\\text{ON}} R_{C} \\approx V_{CC} - I_{T} R_{C},\n$$\n$$\nV_{OH} = V_{CC} - I_{C1,\\text{OFF}} R_{C} \\approx V_{CC}.\n$$\nThe logic swing is\n$$\nV_{LS} = |V_{OH} - V_{OL}| \\approx |V_{CC} - (V_{CC} - I_{T} R_{C})| = I_{T} R_{C}.\n$$\nThis shows that the logic swing is the voltage change across $R_{C}$ caused by steering the current, i.e., it is the product of the tail current and $R_{C}$. The tail current $I_{T}$ is set primarily by the emitter network, typically approximated (for a resistor-tail implementation) by\n$$\nI_{T} \\approx \\frac{V_{\\text{bias,emit}} - V_{EE}}{R_{EE}},\n$$\nor more explicitly including the base-emitter drop of the conducting device as appropriate to the chosen bias scheme. Thus $R_{EE}$ influences $V_{LS}$ through $I_{T}$, while $R_{C}$ directly converts that current to a voltage swing. The element at which the voltage swing is actually developed is $R_{C}$, and the swing magnitude is fundamentally the change in voltage drop across $R_{C}$ when the current is steered.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A states that $R_{C}$ has the primary role because the swing is the change in voltage drop across $R_{C}$ due to current steering. This aligns with $V_{LS} \\approx I_{T} R_{C}$ and correctly identifies where the voltage swing is generated.\n- B claims $R_{EE}$ has the primary role because it sets the current and thus directly determines the swing. This is incomplete: the swing depends on both $I_{T}$ and $R_{C}$; $R_{EE}$ alone does not set $V_{LS}$ without $R_{C}$.\n- C claims proportionality to $R_{C}/R_{EE}$. In general, $V_{LS} \\approx R_{C} \\cdot I_{T}$; while $I_{T}$ may scale like $1/R_{EE}$ for a fixed bias, $V_{LS}$ is not fundamentally determined by the ratio $R_{C}/R_{EE}$ alone and depends on the specific bias voltages and device drops, so this statement is not the most accurate description.\n- D is incorrect because ECL explicitly avoids saturation; $R_{EE}$ is not chosen to drive saturation.\n- E is incorrect because $R_{C}$ does not limit base current; it is in the collector path and sets the collector voltage swing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1932337"}, {"introduction": "Building on the conceptual understanding of logic swing, this next practice moves into quantitative analysis.
