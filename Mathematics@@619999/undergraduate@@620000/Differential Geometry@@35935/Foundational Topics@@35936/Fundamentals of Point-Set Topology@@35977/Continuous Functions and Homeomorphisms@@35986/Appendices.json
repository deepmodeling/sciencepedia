The map $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to C$ is continuous. To check bijectivity, suppose $\\gamma(t)=\\gamma(s)$. Then $t^{2}=s^{2}$ and $t^{3}=s^{3}$. From $t^{2}=s^{2}$ we get $s=\\pm t$. If $s=-t$, then $t^{3}=s^{3}=-t^{3}$, hence $2t^{3}=0$, so $t=0$, and thus $s=0$. Therefore $t=s$, and $\\gamma$ is injective. Surjectivity onto $C$ is immediate by definition, so $\\gamma$ is a bijection.\n\nTo show that $\\gamma$ is a homeomorphism, it remains to prove that the inverse $\\gamma^{-1}:C\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous with respect to the subspace topology on $C$. Define $h:C\\to\\mathbb{R}$ by\n$$\nh(x,y)=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{y}{x}, & (x,y)\\neq (0,0),\\\\\n0, & (x,y)=(0,0).\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nOn $C\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ we have $x=t^{2}>0$, so division by $x$ is valid and the ambient function $(x,y)\\mapsto y/x$ is continuous; its restriction to $C\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ is therefore continuous.

Therefore $h$ is continuous on $C$. Moreover, for $t\\neq 0$, $h(\\gamma(t))=\\frac{t^{3}}{t^{2}}=t$, and for $t=0$, $h(\\gamma(0))=0$, so $h=\\gamma^{-1}$. Hence $\\gamma$ is a homeomorphism, and Statement I is true.\n\nNext, evaluate Statement II. The curve $C$ is given by the zero set of the smooth function $F(x,y)=y^{2}-x^{3}$, but\n$$\n\\nabla F(x,y)=(-3x^{2},\\,2y),\\qquad \\nabla F(0,0)=(0,0),\n$$\nso $(0,0)$ is a critical point of $F$. If $C$ were a smooth $1$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then near each point, and in particular near $(0,0)$, it would be the zero set of a submersion by the regular level set/implicit function theorem characterization. That would imply there exists a smooth function $G$ with $dG\\neq 0$ along $C$ near $(0,0)$ and $C\\cap U=G^{-1}(0)$ for some neighborhood $U$. Equivalently, by the implicit function theorem, near $(0,0)$ the set $C$ would be the graph of a smooth function either of the form $y=f(x)$ or $x=g(y)$. This is impossible: for $x>0$ there are two points of $C$ with the same $x$-coordinate, namely $y=\\pm x^{3/2}$, so $C$ cannot be locally the graph of a single-valued smooth function $y=f(x)$. On the other hand, solving for $x$ gives $x=g(y)=|y|^{2/3}$ (up to sign conventions consistent with $x\\geq 0$), which is not differentiable at $y=0$, so $C$ cannot be locally the graph of a smooth function $x=g(y)$ either. Therefore $C$ fails to be a smooth embedded $1$-submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Equivalently, the given parametrization has $\\gamma'(t)=(2t,3t^{2})$ and $\\gamma'(0)=(0,0)$, so any local parametrization homeomorphic onto a neighborhood in $C$ has zero velocity at the cusp and cannot define an immersion at $(0,0)$.
