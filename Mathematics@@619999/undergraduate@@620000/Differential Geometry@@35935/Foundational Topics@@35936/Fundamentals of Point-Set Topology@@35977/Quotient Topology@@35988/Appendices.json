The Möbius strip", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the topological space created by taking a filled-in triangle $T$ and collapsing its entire boundary $\\partial T$ to a single point. Let this quotient space be $X = T/\\sim$.\n\nFirst, we recognize a fundamental principle in topology: a closed, filled-in triangular region in the plane is topologically equivalent to a closed 2-dimensional disk, $D^2 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\le 1\\}$. This means there exists a homeomorphism $f: T \\to D^2$. A homeomorphism is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse, which essentially means we can continuously deform the triangle into a disk without tearing or gluing. This deformation would map the interior of the triangle to the interior of thedisk, and, crucially, the boundary of the triangle, $\\partial T$, to the boundary of the disk, $\\partial D^2$, which is the circle $S^1$.\n\nThe equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $T$ identifies all points in $\\partial T$ to a single point. Since the homeomorphism $f$ maps $\\partial T$ to a $\\partial D^2$, the identification on $T$ is topologically equivalent to performing a similar identification on $D^2$. The corresponding equivalence relation on $D^2$ would identify all points on its boundary circle $\\partial D^2$ to a single point.\n\nNow, let's visualize this process on the disk $D^2$. Imagine the disk is a flexible, circular piece of cloth with a drawstring along its edge (the boundary circle $\\partial D^2$). The operation of identifying all points on the boundary to a single point is equivalent to pulling the drawstring tight, closing the opening. As we pull the drawstring, the flat disk puckers and closes up, forming a bag-like shape with no opening. This resulting closed surface has the shape of a sphere.\n\nTo be more formal, consider the 2-sphere $S^2$ (e.g., the surface of a globe). We can think of the disk $D^2$ as, for instance, the Northern Hemisphere. Its boundary, $\\partial D^2$, is the equator. The operation of collapsing this boundary circle to a single point corresponds to shrinking the entire equator down to a single point. If we do this, the Northern Hemisphere closes up to form a full sphere, with the equator now collapsed into what would be the South Pole. Thus, the space $D^2/\\partial D^2$ is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, $S^2$.\n\nSince the original space $X = T/\\sim$ is homeomorphic to $D^2/\\partial D^2$, we can conclude that $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$.\n\nLet's analyze the other options to confirm our choice:\n- The 2-torus ($T^2$) is formed by identifying opposite sides of a square. It has \"one hole\" (genus 1), whereas a sphere has \"no holes\" (genus 0).\n- The real projective plane ($\\mathbb{R}P^2$) is formed by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of a disk. This is a different identification and results in a non-orientable surface. Our resulting space, the sphere, is orientable.\n- A cylinder is formed by identifying only one pair of opposite sides of a rectangle. It has two boundary circles. The space $X$ has no boundary.\n- A Möbius strip is formed by identifying one pair of opposite sides of a rectangle with a twist. It has one boundary circle and is non-orientable.\n\nTherefore, the only space that matches our construction is the 2-sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1659652"}, {"introduction": "While visual intuition is a great starting point, a deep understanding requires engaging with the formal definitions.

On each of the open intervals $(0, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(3, 4)$, the components of $p(t)$ are linear functions of $t$. Linear functions are continuous, so $p(t)$ is continuous on these open intervals. We must check for continuity at the points where the definition changes: $t=1, 2, 3$.\n\nAt $t=1$:\nThe limit from the left is $\\lim_{t \\to 1^-} p(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 1^-} (t, 0) = (1, 0)$.\nThe function value at $t=1$ is given by the second piece: $p(1) = (1, 1-1) = (1, 0)$.\nSince the left-limit equals the function value, $p$ is continuous at $t=1$.\n\nAt $t=2$:\nThe limit from the left is $\\lim_{t \\to 2^-} p(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 2^-} (1, t-1) = (1, 1)$.\nThe function value at $t=2$ is given by the third piece: $p(2) = (3-2, 1) = (1, 1)$.\nSince the left-limit equals the function value, $p$ is continuous at $t=2$.\n\nAt $t=3$:\nThe limit from the left is $\\lim_{t \\to 3^-} p(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 3^-} (3-t, 1) = (0, 1)$.\nThe function value at $t=3$ is given by the fourth piece: $p(3) = (0, 4-3) = (0, 1)$.\nSince the left-limit equals the function value, $p$ is continuous at $t=3$.\n\nSince $p$ is continuous on the open subintervals and at the transition points, it is continuous on the entire domain $[0, 4)$. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\n**Statement B: Bijectivity**\n\nA map is bijective if it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).\n\n*   **Injectivity:** We need to show that if $p(t_1) = p(t_2)$, then $t_1 = t_2$.\n    The four intervals $[0, 1)$, $[1, 2)$, $[2, 3)$, and $[3, 4)$ are disjoint. Let's examine their images:\n    - $p([0, 1)) = [0, 1) \\times \\{0\\}$ (Bottom edge, excluding the corner $(1,0)$)\n    - $p([1, 2)) = \\{1\\} \\times [0, 1)$ (Right edge, excluding the corner $(1,1)$)\n    - $p([2, 3)) = (0, 1] \\times \\{1\\}$ (Top edge, excluding the corner $(0,1)$)\n    - $p([3, 4)) = \\{0\\} \\times (0, 1]$ (Left edge, excluding the corner $(0,0)$)\n    These four image sets are mutually disjoint. For example, any point in $p([0, 1))$ has a $y$-coordinate of 0, while any point in $p([1, 2))$ has an $x$-coordinate of 1, and so on. If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are in different intervals, $p(t_1) \\neq p(t_2)$. If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are in the same interval, say $[0, 1)$, then $p(t_1) = (t_1, 0)$ and $p(t_2) = (t_2, 0)$. Equality implies $t_1=t_2$. The same logic applies to the other intervals. Thus, $p$ is injective.\n\n*   **Surjectivity:** We need to show that the image of $p$ is all of $Y$.\n    The union of the images is:\n    $\\text{Im}(p) = ([0, 1) \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (\\{1\\} \\times [0, 1)) \\cup ((0, 1] \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup (\\{0\\} \\times (0, 1])$.\n    Let's check the corners of the square:\n    - $(0,0) = p(0)$, which is in the image.\n    - $(1,0) = p(1)$, which is in the image.\n    - $(1,1) = p(2)$, which is in the image.\n    - $(0,1) = p(3)$, which is in the image.\n    The union of the images of the four intervals covers the four open sides of the square, and the images of the integers $0, 1, 2, 3$ cover the four corners. Therefore, the image of $p$ is the entire boundary $Y$. The map is surjective.\n\nSince $p$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\n**Statements C, D, E: Homeomorphism and Quotient Map**\n\nA map $p: X \\to Y$ is a **quotient map** if it is surjective and a set $U \\subseteq Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if its preimage $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.\nSince $p$ is continuous and surjective, the condition \"$U$ is open in $Y \\implies p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$\" is already satisfied. To be a quotient map, the reverse implication must also hold: \"$p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X \\implies U$ is open in $Y$\".\n\nLet's test this condition. Consider the point $(0,0) \\in Y$. A \"problem point\" for this kind of map is often where the domain \"wraps around\", which corresponds to $t=0$ in $X$. An open neighborhood of $0$ in $X=[0,4)$ is of the form $[0, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nLet's choose $V = [0, 1/2)$. This set is open in $X=[0, 4)$ because it can be written as the intersection of an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ with $X$, for example, $V = (-1, 1/2) \\cap [0, 4)$.\n\nNow consider the image of $V$ under $p$. Let $U = p(V) = p([0, 1/2)) = \\{(t, 0) \\mid 0 \\le t < 1/2\\}$. This is a line segment on the bottom edge of the square, starting at the corner $(0,0)$ and extending to $(1/2, 0)$, including $(0,0)$ but not $(1/2, 0)$.\n\nSince $p$ is a bijection, the preimage of $U$ is exactly $V$: $p^{-1}(U) = V = [0, 1/2)$. As we established, $p^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in $X$.\n\nFor $p$ to be a quotient map, $U$ must be an open set in $Y$. Let's determine if $U$ is open in $Y$ (with the subspace topology from $\\mathbb{R}^2$). A set is open in the subspace topology if it is the intersection of an open set in the ambient space ($\\mathbb{R}^2$) with the subspace ($Y$).\nConsider the point $(0,0) \\in U$. Any open ball $B_r((0,0))$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ centered at $(0,0)$ with radius $r>0$ will contain points $(x,y)$ with $x>0, y=0$ AND points with $x=0, y>0$. Therefore, the intersection $B_r((0,0)) \\cap Y$ will contain a piece of the bottom edge and a piece of the left edge of the square. The set $U = [0, 1/2) \\times \\{0\\}$ does not contain any part of the left edge. Thus, there is no open set $O \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $O \\cap Y = U$. So, $U$ is not open in $Y$.\n\nWe have found a set $U \\subseteq Y$ such that $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$, but $U$ is not open in $Y$. This violates the definition of a quotient map. Therefore, $p$ is **not a quotient map**.\n\nA **homeomorphism** is a continuous bijection whose inverse is also continuous. A key theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection is a homeomorphism if and only if it is a quotient map. Since we have shown that $p$ is a continuous bijection but not a quotient map, it cannot be a homeomorphism.\n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n- $p$ is continuous. (A is false)\n- $p$ is a bijection. (B is false)\n- $p$ is not a quotient map, and therefore not a homeomorphism. (C and D are false)\n\nThe only remaining statement is E: $p$ is a continuous bijection, but not a quotient map.
