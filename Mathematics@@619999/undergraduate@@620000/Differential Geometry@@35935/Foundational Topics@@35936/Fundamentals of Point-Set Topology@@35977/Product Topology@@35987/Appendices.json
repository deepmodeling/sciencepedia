The most direct method is to use the properties of continuous functions.\n\n**Step 1: Define a suitable continuous function.**\nLet us define a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x, y) = xy$. This function is a polynomial in the variables $x$ and $y$. In multivariable calculus, it is established that all polynomial functions are continuous everywhere on their domain. Therefore, $f$ is a continuous function on all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Express the set $S$ in terms of the function $f$.**\nThe set $S$ consists of all points $(x, y)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ for which the condition $xy=1$ is satisfied. Using our function $f$, this is equivalent to the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y)=1$. In the language of preimages, $S$ is the preimage of the set $\\{1\\}$ under the function $f$. We can write this as:\n$$S = f^{-1}(\\{1\\})$$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the topological nature of the set $\\{1\\}$ in the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$.**\nThe codomain of our function $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with its standard topology. In any Hausdorff (or even T1) space, every singleton set (a set containing a single point) is a closed set. The standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ is Hausdorff. Therefore, the set $\\{1\\}$ is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the theorem relating continuous functions and closed sets.**\nA fundamental theorem in point-set topology states that for a continuous function between two topological spaces, the preimage of any closed set in the codomain is a closed set in the domain.\n\nIn our case:\n- The function $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous.\n- The set $\\{1\\}$ is a closed subset of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- The set $S = f^{-1}(\\{1\\})$ is the preimage of this closed set.\n\nAccording to the theorem, $S$ must be a closed subset of the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This confirms that statement B is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze why the other options are incorrect.**\nTo ensure our conclusion is robust, we can show why the other options fail.\n\n- **Is S open? (Option A)**\nA set is open if, for every point in the set, there exists an open neighborhood of that point that is entirely contained within the set. Let's take a point $p = (1, 1)$, which is clearly in $S$ since $1 \\times 1 = 1$. Any open neighborhood of $p$ in the product topology must contain an open rectangle of the form $(1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon) \\times (1-\\delta, 1+\\delta)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$. Consider a point $p' = (1, 1+\\delta/2)$ within this rectangle. For this point, $f(p') = 1 \\times (1+\\delta/2) = 1 + \\delta/2 \\neq 1$. So, $p' \\notin S$. Since every open neighborhood of the point $(1,1) \\in S$ contains points not in $S$, the set $S$ cannot be open.\n\n- **Is S both open and closed? (Option C)**\nSince we have shown that $S$ is not open, it cannot be both open and closed. (In a connected space like $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the only sets that are both open and closed are the empty set and the space itself.)\n\n- **Is S neither open nor closed?
