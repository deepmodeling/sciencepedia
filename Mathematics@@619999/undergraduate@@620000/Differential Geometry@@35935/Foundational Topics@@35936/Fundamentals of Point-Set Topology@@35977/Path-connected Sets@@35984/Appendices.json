A fundamental result in the analysis of Euclidean spaces is that an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is connected if and only if it is path-connected. The standard proof of the implication \"open and connected $\\implies$ path-connected\" actually constructs a polygonal path. The argument proceeds by taking a point $a \\in S$ and considering the set $A$ of all points in $S$ that can be reached from $a$ by a polygonal path. One then shows that $A$ is non-empty (since $a \\in A$), open (because $S$ is open, so any point in $A$ has a ball around it in $S$, and all points in that ball can be reached by one additional line segment), and closed in $S$ (a limit point of a sequence in $A$ can be shown to be reachable). Since $S$ is connected, the only non-empty subset that is both open and closed in $S$ is $S$ itself. Thus $A=S$, meaning all points in $S$ are polygonally path-connected to $a$, and therefore to each other.

This set is the union of a graph and a line segment. It can be proven that $S$ is a connected set. However, $S$ is not path-connected. There is no continuous path within $S$ that can connect a point on the graph part, such as $(1/\\pi, 0)$, to a point on the segment part, such as $(0, 0)$. Any path starting on the graph would have to oscillate infinitely fast as it approaches the y-axis, failing to be continuous at any point on the y-axis segment.\n\n**Statement C: If a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ is polygonally path-connected, then $S$ must be open.**\n\nThis statement is **FALSE**. We can find a simple counterexample. Consider the closed unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, $S = \\{(x,y) \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\}$. This set is not open, as it contains its boundary. However, it is a convex set. For any two points $a, b \\in S$, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within $S$. This segment is a polygonal path of length 1. Therefore, $S$ is polygonally path-connected but is not an open set.\n\n**Statement D: If a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ is convex, then $S$ is polygonally path-connected.**\n\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The definition of a convex set $S$ is that for any two points $a, b \\in S$, the entire line segment joining them, denoted $[a,b]$, is a subset of $S$. This line segment itself forms a polygonal path between $a$ and $b$ (a path with $k=1$, $p_0=a$, $p_1=b$).

We can use a variation of the counterexample from B. Let $S = \\{(x, \\sin(1/x)) \\mid x \\in (0, 1]\\}$. This set $S$ is the graph of a continuous function over a connected interval, so it is path-connected (and therefore connected). The closure of this set is $\\bar{S} = S \\cup \\{(0, y) \\mid y \\in [-1, 1]\\}$, which is the full topologist's sine curve. As discussed for statement B, $\\bar{S}$ is not path-connected.
