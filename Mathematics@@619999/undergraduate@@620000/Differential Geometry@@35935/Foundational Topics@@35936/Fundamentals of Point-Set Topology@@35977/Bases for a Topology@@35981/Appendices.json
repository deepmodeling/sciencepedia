{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a concept in mathematics often begins with testing its boundaries. This first practice problem challenges you to apply the two fundamental axioms of a topological basis to a visually intuitive collection of sets in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$: infinite horizontal and vertical strips. It serves as a crucial exercise in rigor, demonstrating that even when a collection covers the entire space, the intersection property can fail in a subtle yet important way [@problem_id:1625111].", "problem": "In a simplified model for information flow across a large, two-dimensional integrated circuit, signals can be broadcast along specific pathways. These pathways are categorized into two types: horizontal channels and vertical channels. A horizontal channel, denoted $H_{a,b}$, is the set of all points $(x, y)$ in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $a  y  b$ for some real numbers $a  b$. A vertical channel, denoted $V_{c,d}$, is the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that $c  x  d$ for some real numbers $c  d$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all possible horizontal and vertical channels, i.e., $\\mathcal{B} = \\{H_{a,b} \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}, a  b\\} \\cup \\{V_{c,d} \\mid c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}, c  d\\}$.\n\nDetermine whether this collection $\\mathcal{B}$ forms a basis for a topology on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.

No, $\\mathcal{B}$ fails to satisfy the condition that the union of its elements must cover the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nD. No, $\\mathcal{B}$ fails to satisfy the condition regarding the intersection of any two basis elements.", "solution": "We must check the two basis axioms for a collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to be a basis for some topology.\n\nFirst, the cover condition: For every point $(x_0, y_0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we need some $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $(x_0, y_0) \\in B$. Given $(x_0, y_0)$, choose any $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a  y_0  b$; then $(x_0, y_0) \\in H_{a,b} \\in \\mathcal{B}$. Alternatively, choose $c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $c  x_0  d$; then $(x_0, y_0) \\in V_{c,d} \\in \\mathcal{B}$. Hence the union of elements of $\\mathcal{B}$ is all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so the cover condition holds.\n\nSecond, the intersection condition: For any $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ and any point $p \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$, there must exist $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $p \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. We analyze cases.\n- If $B_1 = H_{a,b}$ and $B_2 = H_{a',b'}$, then either $H_{a,b} \\cap H_{a',b'} = \\varnothing$ or $H_{a,b} \\cap H_{a',b'} = H_{\\max\\{a,a'\\},\\min\\{b,b'\\}} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, so the condition holds in this case.\n- If $B_1 = V_{c,d}$ and $B_2 = V_{c',d'}$, then either $V_{c,d} \\cap V_{c',d'} = \\varnothing$ or $V_{c,d} \\cap V_{c',d'} = V_{\\max\\{c,c'\\},\\min\\{d,d'\\}} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, so the condition holds in this case.\n- If $B_1 = H_{a,b}$ and $B_2 = V_{c,d}$ with $a  b$ and $c  d$, then $B_1 \\cap B_2 = \\{(x,y): c  x  d, a  y  b\\}$, which is an open rectangle. Let $p = (x_0, y_0)$ satisfy $c  x_0  d$ and $a  y_0  b$. Suppose there exists $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $p \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. If $B_3$ is horizontal, then $B_3 = H_{e,f}$ for some $e  f$, and by definition $H_{e,f} = \\{(x,y): e  y  f\\}$ imposes no restriction on $x$. Thus for any $y$ with $e  y  f$ and any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $(x,y) \\in H_{e,f}$. For $H_{e,f}$ to be contained in $B_1 \\cap B_2$, we would require $c  x  d$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which is impossible. Hence no horizontal $B_3$ can satisfy $B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. If $B_3$ is vertical, then $B_3 = V_{g,h}$ for some $g  h$, and $V_{g,h} = \\{(x,y): g  x  h\\}$ imposes no restriction on $y$. Thus for any $x$ with $g  x  h$ and any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $(x,y) \\in V_{g,h}$. For $V_{g,h}$ to be contained in $B_1 \\cap B_2$, we would require $a  y  b$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which is impossible. Hence no vertical $B_3$ can satisfy $B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. Therefore, in the mixed case, the intersection condition fails.\n\nSince the intersection condition fails for horizontal and vertical channels, $\\mathcal{B}$ does not form a basis for any topology on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.

No individual set in $\\mathcal{B}$ can be all of $\\mathbb{R}$, so some points might not be covered.\nC. $\\mathcal{B}$ is not a basis for a topology because it fails the intersection property.
