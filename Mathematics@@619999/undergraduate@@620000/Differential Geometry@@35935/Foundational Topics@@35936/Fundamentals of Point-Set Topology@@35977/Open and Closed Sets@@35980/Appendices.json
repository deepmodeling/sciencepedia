Is the set $S$ open?**\nA set is open if every point in the set is an interior point. An interior point is a point for which there exists an open ball centered at that point that is entirely contained within the set.\nLet's consider the point $p = (0, 0)$, which is in $S$ because its $x$-coordinate is 0 and its $y$-coordinate, 0, is in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\nConsider any open ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ centered at $p$ with any radius $\\epsilon > 0$. This ball is the set of all points $(x', y')$ such that $\\sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} < \\epsilon$.\nThis ball will always contain points with a negative $x$-coordinate, for instance, the point $(-\\epsilon/2, 0)$.\nAccording to the definition of $S$, all points $(x,y)$ in $S$ must have an $x$-coordinate $x \\ge 0$. Therefore, the point $(-\\epsilon/2, 0)$ is not in $S$.\nSince every open ball around $p=(0,0)$ contains points not in $S$, $p$ is not an interior point of $S$. Because we have found at least one point in $S$ that is not an interior point, the set $S$ is not open. This eliminates option A.\n\n**2. Is the set $S$ closed?**\nA set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points. A point $q$ is a limit point of $S$ if there exists a sequence of points $\\{p_n\\}$ in $S$, with $p_n \\neq q$, such that $p_n \\to q$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Let's identify the limit points of $S$.\n\nLet $G = \\left\\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 0 < x \\le 1, y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\right\\}$ and $L = \\left\\{ (0, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid -1 \\le y \\le 1 \\right\\}$. So, $S = G \\cup L$.\n\nLet $q = (a, b)$ be a limit point of $S$. There is a sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ in $S$ converging to $q$.\n- If $q$ is a limit point of a sequence entirely within $G$, so $p_n = (x_n, \\sin(1/x_n))$ with $0 < x_n \\le 1$. The x-coordinates converge to $a$, where $0 \\le a \\le 1$.\n    - If $a > 0$, by the continuity of the function $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$ on $(0, 1]$, the y-coordinates must converge to $b = \\sin(1/a)$. Thus, $q = (a, \\sin(1/a))$ is in $G$, and therefore in $S$.\n    - If $a = 0$, the y-coordinates $\\sin(1/x_n)$ oscillate. Since $-1 \\le \\sin(1/x_n) \\le 1$ for all $n$, any limit $b$ of the y-coordinates must satisfy $-1 \\le b \\le 1$. So, the limit point is $q = (0, b)$ with $b \\in [-1, 1]$, which means $q \\in L$, and therefore in $S$.\n\n- We should also verify that every point in $L$ is indeed a limit point of $G$. Let $q_0 = (0, y_0)$ be an arbitrary point in $L$, so $-1 \\le y_0 \\le 1$. We need to find a sequence in $G$ that converges to $q_0$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\arcsin(y_0)$, which exists since $y_0 \\in [-1, 1]$. Consider the sequence of angles $\\theta_n = 2n\\pi + \\alpha$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $\\theta_n \\to \\infty$.\nLet $x_n = 1/\\theta_n$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $x_n \\to 0^+$. For $n$ large enough, $x_n \\in (0, 1]$.\nThe sequence of points $p_n = (x_n, \\sin(1/x_n)) = (x_n, \\sin(\\theta_n)) = (1/\\theta_n, \\sin(2n\\pi+\\alpha)) = (1/\\theta_n, y_0)$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $p_n \\to (0, y_0) = q_0$. So, every point in $L$ is a limit point of $G$.\n\n- If $q$ is a limit point of a sequence entirely within $L$, since $L$ is a closed segment of a line, it is a closed set, so it contains all of its own limit points. Thus, $q \\in L$, and therefore in $S$.\n\nIn all cases, any limit point of $S$ is contained in $S$. Thus, the set $S$ is closed. This eliminates option D, \"neither open nor closed\".\n\n**3. Is the set $S$ compact?**\nBy the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\nWe have already shown that $S$ is closed. Now we check if it is bounded.\nA set is bounded if it can be contained within a ball of finite radius.\nFor any point $(x, y) \\in S$:\n- If $(x, y) \\in G$, then $0 < x \\le 1$ and $y = \\sin(1/x)$, which implies $-1 \\le y \\le 1$.\n- If $(x, y) \\in L$, then $x=0$ and $-1 \\le y \\le 1$.\nFor any point $(x, y) \\in S$, we have $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $-1 \\le y \\le 1$. The set $S$ is entirely contained within the rectangle $[0, 1] \\times [-1, 1]$. This rectangle is a bounded set.\nThe squared distance of any point in $S$ from the origin is $d^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\le 1^2 + 1^2 = 2$. So every point in $S$ is within a distance of $\\sqrt{2}$ from the origin. Thus, $S$ is a bounded set.\n\nSince $S$ is both closed and bounded, by the Heine-Borel theorem, $S$ is a compact set.\nThis means option C is correct. Option B, which states that $S$ is closed but not compact, is incorrect because $S$ is also bounded.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The set $S$ is compact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1655524"}]}
