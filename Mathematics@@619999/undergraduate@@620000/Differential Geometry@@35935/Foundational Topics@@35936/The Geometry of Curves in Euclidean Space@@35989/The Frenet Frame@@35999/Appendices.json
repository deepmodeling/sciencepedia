It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the curvature and Frenet-Serret apparatus of a straight line, defined by the parametric equation $\\gamma(t) = p + v t$, where $p, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ are constant vectors and $v$ is nonzero. The analysis must be based on the fundamental definitions in terms of the arc-length parameter $s$.\n\n(a) Reparametrization by arc length and computation of curvature $\\kappa(s)$.\n\nFirst, we find the arc-length function $s(t)$. The tangent vector with respect to the parameter $t$ is the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\n\\gamma^{\\prime}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(p + v t) = v\n$$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this vector:\n$$\n\\|\\gamma^{\\prime}(t)\\| = \\|v\\|\n$$\nSince $v$ is a constant nonzero vector, the speed $\\|v\\|$ is a positive constant. Let us denote this constant by $c = \\|v\\| > 0$.\n\nThe arc-length function $s(t)$, measured from $t=0$, is given by the integral of the speed:\n$$\ns(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\|\\gamma^{\\prime}(\\xi)\\| \\,d\\xi = \\int_{0}^{t} c \\,d\\xi = c t\n$$\nThus, we have the relationship $s = c t$. To reparametrize the curve by arc length, we express $t$ as a function of $s$:\n$$\nt(s) = \\frac{s}{c} = \\frac{s}{\\|v\\|}\n$$\nWe substitute this into the original equation for $\\gamma$ to obtain the arc-length parametrization, which we also denote by $\\gamma(s)$:\n$$\n\\gamma(s) = p + v \\, t(s) = p + v \\frac{s}{\\|v\\|} = p + \\left(\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right) s\n$$\nThis is the equation of the line parametrized by its arc length.\n\nNext, we compute the unit tangent vector $T(s)$, which is defined as the derivative of the arc-length-parametrized curve with respect to $s$:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{ds}(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( p + \\left(\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right) s \\right)\n$$\nSince $p$ and $v$ are constant vectors, the term $\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}$ is also a constant vector. The derivative is therefore:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\n$$\nWe observe that the unit tangent vector $T(s)$ is a constant vector; it does not change as $s$ varies. This is geometrically intuitive, as a straight line always points in the same direction.\n\nThe curvature, $\\kappa(s)$, is defined as the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\left\\| \\frac{dT}{ds}(s) \\right\\|\n$$\nSince $T(s)$ is a constant vector, its derivative with respect to $s$ is the zero vector:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{ds}(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|} \\right) = \\vec{0}\n$$\nTherefore, the curvature is the magnitude of the zero vector, which is zero for all $s$:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\|\\vec{0}\\| = 0\n$$\nThe curvature of a straight line is identically zero, which confirms the intuition that curvature measures the failure of a curve to be a straight line.\n\n(b) The Frenet-Serret apparatus.\n\nThe Frenet-Serret frame $\\{T(s), N(s), B(s)\\}$ and the torsion $\\tau(s)$ are constructed from the derivatives of the curve. The construction begins after computing $T(s)$ and $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$.\n\nThe first Frenet-Serret equation is $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s) = \\kappa(s) N(s)$. The principal normal vector, $N(s)$, is defined as the unit vector in the direction of $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$. Specifically, for curves where $\\kappa(s) \\neq 0$, it is given by:\n$$\nN(s) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa(s)} \\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\n$$\nAs we found in part (a), for a straight line, $\\kappa(s) = 0$ for all $s$. Consequently, the denominator in the expression for $N(s)$ is zero. Moreover, the numerator $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$ is also the zero vector. The expression becomes $\\frac{\\vec{0}}{0}$, which is indeterminate. The principal normal vector $N(s)$ is therefore not well-defined.\n\nGeometrically, $N(s)$ points in the direction the curve is turning. A straight line does not turn, so there is no unique direction of turning. At any point on the line, any unit vector orthogonal to the tangent vector $T$ could be chosen as a normal, but there is no canonical choice determined by the geometry of the curve itself.\n\nThe binormal vector $B(s)$ is defined by the cross product $B(s) = T(s) \\times N(s)$. Since $N(s)$ is not well-defined, $B(s)$ is also not well-defined.\n\nFinally, the torsion $\\tau(s)$ is defined via the Frenet-Serret equation $\\frac{dB}{ds}(s) = -\\tau(s) N(s)$. Since both $B(s)$ and $N(s)$ are undefined, the torsion $\\tau(s)$ is also not defined within this formal framework. The entire Frenet-Serret apparatus collapses for a curve with zero curvature.\n\nThe implication is that the concept of torsion, which measures the rate at which a curve twists out of its osculating plane (the plane spanned by $T$ and $N$), is not applicable to a straight line because a unique osculating plane does not exist. Although by convention the torsion of a straight line is taken to be $0$, this is an assignment made for consistency, not a value derived from a well-defined Frenet-Serret apparatus.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2988149"}, {"introduction": "For any curve that actually bends, its local geometry is entirely captured by its curvature $\\kappa(s)$ and torsion $\\tau(s)$.
