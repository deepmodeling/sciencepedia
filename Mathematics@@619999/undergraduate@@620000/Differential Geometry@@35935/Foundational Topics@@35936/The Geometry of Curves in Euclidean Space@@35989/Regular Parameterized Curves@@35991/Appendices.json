Since $|t| = t$ for $t \\geq 0$ and $|t| = -t$ for $t0$, we have\n$$\ny(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nt^{5},  t \\geq 0,\\\\\n- t^{5},  t  0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNote that this is also equivalent to $y(t) = t^5 \\text{sgn}(t)$ if we define $\\text{sgn}(0)=0$, or more simply $y(t)=t|t^4|=|t|^5$.\n\nTo check for regularity, we compute the velocity vector $\\alpha'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t))$.\nThe derivative of the first component is $x'(t) = 5t^4$. For the second component, we differentiate the piecewise definition:\n$$\ny'(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n5 t^{4},  t  0,\\\\\n-5 t^{4},  t  0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt $t=0$, we must use the limit definition:\n$$\ny'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{y(h) - y(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^4|h| - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} h^3|h| = 0.\n$$\nSo the velocity vector $\\alpha'(t)$ is\n$$\n\\alpha'(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n(5 t^{4}, 5 t^{4}),  t  0,\\\\\n(0, 0),  t = 0, \\\\\n(5 t^{4}, -5 t^{4}),  t  0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha'(0) = (0,0)$, the velocity is zero at $t=0$. Therefore, the curve is **not regular**.\n\nTo check for smoothness, we need to determine if both component functions are of class $C^{\\infty}$ (infinitely differentiable).\nThe first component, $x(t) = t^{5}$, is a polynomial and is therefore $C^{\\infty}$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\nFor the second component, $y(t)$, let's check its higher-order derivatives. We have already found $y'(t)$ which is continuous at $t=0$ since $\\lim_{t \\to 0} y'(t) = 0 = y'(0)$.\nLet's find $y''(t)$:\n$$\ny''(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n20 t^{3},  t  0,\\\\\n-20 t^{3},  t  0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAgain, $y''(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$ since $\\lim_{t \\to 0} y''(t) = 0$. We can continue this process.\nThe $k$-th derivative for $t \\neq 0$ is\n$$\ny^{(k)}(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{5!}{(5-k)!} t^{5-k},  t  0,\\\\\n-\\frac{5!}{(5-k)!} t^{5-k},  t  0,\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad \\text{for } 1 \\leq k \\leq 5.\n$$\nFor $k \\leq 4$, as $t \\to 0$, $y^{(k)}(t) \\to 0$, so we can define $y^{(k)}(0) = 0$ to make the derivatives continuous up to order 4.\nHowever, for the fifth derivative ($k=5$):\n$$\ny^{(5)}(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n5!,  t  0,\\\\\n-5!,  t  0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe limit from the right is $\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} y^{(5)}(t) = 5! = 120$, while the limit from the left is $\\lim_{t \\to 0^-} y^{(5)}(t) = -5! = -120$. Since the left and right limits are not equal, the fifth derivative $y^{(5)}(0)$ does not exist.\nBecause $y(t)$ is not five times differentiable, it is not infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$). Therefore, the curve $\\alpha(t)$ is **not smooth**.\n\nConclusion: The curve is not regular (since $\\alpha'(0)=(0,0)$) and not smooth (since the second component is not $C^\\infty$).
