This first exercise allows you to verify the Rotation Index Theorem for a simple, smooth closed curve—a \"squircle.\" By directly calculating the total turn of the tangent vector, you will build a concrete intuition for why such curves always have a rotation index of +1 when traversed counter-clockwise. [@problem_id:1682845]", "problem": "In the Cartesian plane, consider a smooth, closed curve known as a \"squircle,\" which is defined by the implicit equation $x^4 + y^4 = 1$.\n\nThe rotation index of a smooth, regular closed curve is a fundamental concept in differential geometry. It is an integer that quantifies the total number of complete counter-clockwise revolutions performed by the curve's unit tangent vector during one full traversal along the curve.\n\nDetermine the numerical value of the rotation index for the squircle, assuming the curve is traversed once in the counter-clockwise direction.", "solution": "Let the squircle be defined by a level set of the function $F(x,y) = x^4 + y^4$. The curve is given by $F(x,y) = 1$. The rotation index, $I$, is defined as the total change in the angle of the unit tangent vector, $\\Delta\\phi$, divided by $2\\pi$. That is, $I = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2\\pi}$.\n\nA key property of level-set curves is that the gradient vector, $\\nabla F$, is always normal (perpendicular) to the curve at any point $(x,y)$. For our function $F(x,y) = x^4 + y^4$, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla F(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\right) = (4x^3, 4y^3)\n$$\nA tangent vector, $T$, at a point $(x,y)$ on the curve must be orthogonal to the normal vector $\\nabla F$. If a normal vector is $(a,b)$, a vector orthogonal to it is $(-b,a)$ or $(b,-a)$. Let's choose the tangent vector $T$ to be proportional to $(-4y^3, 4x^3)$. For simplicity, we can ignore the constant factor of 4 and define our tangent vector field as:\n$$\nT(x,y) = (-y^3, x^3)\n$$\nWe must verify that this choice of tangent vector corresponds to a counter-clockwise (CCW) traversal of the curve. Let's test a point in the first quadrant, for example, the point where $x=y$. Substituting into the curve's equation gives $x^4+x^4=1 \\implies 2x^4=1 \\implies x = 1/\\sqrt[4]{2}$. So, at the point $P_1 = (1/\\sqrt[4]{2}, 1/\\sqrt[4]{2})$, the tangent vector is:\n$$\nT(P_1) = \\left( -\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{2}}\\right)^3, \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{2}}\\right)^3 \\right) = \\left( -\\frac{1}{2^{3/4}}, \\frac{1}{2^{3/4}} \\right)\n$$\nThis vector has a negative x-component and a positive y-component, which corresponds to movement \"up and to the left\". This is consistent with a CCW traversal in the first quadrant. Thus, our choice of $T(x,y) = (-y^3, x^3)$ correctly represents the CCW direction.\n\nNow, we track the angle of this tangent vector as we traverse the curve, starting from the point where it intersects the positive x-axis. Let $\\phi$ be the angle of the tangent vector $T = (T_x, T_y)$, measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis. The four key points are the intersections with the coordinate axes.\n\n1.  **Starting Point A: $(1,0)$**\n    At this point, the tangent vector is $T_A = (-0^3, 1^3) = (0,1)$. This vector points straight up along the positive y-axis. The angle is $\\phi_A = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n2.  **Point B: $(0,1)$**\n    After traversing the first quadrant, we reach the point $(0,1)$. The tangent vector is $T_B = (-1^3, 0^3) = (-1,0)$. This vector points left along the negative x-axis. The angle is $\\phi_B = \\pi$. In the first quadrant, the angle of the tangent vector has continuously changed from $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\pi$.\n\n3.  **Point C: $(-1,0)$**\n    After traversing the second quadrant, we reach $(-1,0)$. The tangent vector is $T_C = (-0^3, (-1)^3) = (0,-1)$. This vector points straight down along the negative y-axis. The angle is $\\phi_C = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. The angle has continuously changed from $\\pi$ to $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\n\n4.  **Point D: $(0,-1)$**\n    After traversing the third quadrant, we reach $(0,-1)$. The tangent vector is $T_D = (-(-1)^3, 0^3) = (1,0)$. This vector points right along the positive x-axis. The angle is $\\phi_D = 2\\pi$. The angle has continuously changed from $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ to $2\\pi$.\n\n5.  **Return to Point A: $(1,0)$**\n    Finally, we traverse the fourth quadrant to return to our starting point $(1,0)$. As we approach $(1,0)$, the tangent vector approaches $(0,1)$ again. To maintain continuity in the angle, the angle must increase from $2\\pi$ at point D to $2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{5\\pi}{2}$ upon returning to point A.\n\nThe traversal starts with the tangent vector having an angle of $\\phi_{initial} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. After one complete CCW loop, the tangent vector returns to the same orientation, but its cumulative angle is $\\phi_{final} = \\frac{5\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe total change in angle is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_{final} - \\phi_{initial} = \\frac{5\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{2} = 2\\pi\n$$\nThe rotation index $I$ is then calculated as:\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi} = 1\n$$\nThis result aligns with the Rotation Index Theorem, which states that any simple, closed, regular curve traversed counter-clockwise has a rotation index of +1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "1682845"}, {"introduction": "Having established the baseline, we now explore how the rotation index behaves for more complex, self-intersecting paths.
