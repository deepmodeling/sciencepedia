We are interested in the properties of this surface at a specific point $p = (0, 0, 1)$, which lies on $S$.\n\nA 1-form at the point $p$ on the surface $S$ is a linear map from the tangent space of $S$ at $p$ to the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.

Therefore the tangent space $T_{p}S$ is $2$-dimensional.\n\nBy definition, a $1$-form at $p$ on $S$ is a linear functional on $T_{p}S$, i.e., an element of the dual space $T_{p}^{*}S$.
