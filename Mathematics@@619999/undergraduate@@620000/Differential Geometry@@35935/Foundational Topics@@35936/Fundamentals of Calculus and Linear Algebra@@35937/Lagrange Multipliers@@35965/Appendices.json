The plane equation: $g_2(x, y, z) = x - y - z = 0$.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers for two constraints, which states that at an extremum point, the gradient of the function is a linear combination of the gradients of the constraint functions, provided the gradients of the constraints are linearly independent. The condition is expressed as $\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g_1 + \\mu \\nabla g_2$, where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lagrange multipliers.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradients of the functions $f$, $g_1$, and $g_2$:\n$\\nabla f(x, y, z) = \\langle \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\rangle = \\langle 1, 0, 0 \\rangle$\n$\\nabla g_1(x, y, z) = \\langle \\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial z} \\rangle = \\langle 0, 2y, 2z \\rangle$\n$\\nabla g_2(x, y, z) = \\langle \\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial z} \\rangle = \\langle 1, -1, -1 \\rangle$\n\nNow, we set up the system of equations from $\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g_1 + \\mu \\nabla g_2$:\n$\\langle 1, 0, 0 \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle 0, 2y, 2z \\rangle + \\mu \\langle 1, -1, -1 \\rangle$\n$\\langle 1, 0, 0 \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, 2\\lambda y - \\mu, 2\\lambda z - \\mu \\rangle$\n\nThis vector equation gives us three scalar equations:\n(1) $1 = \\mu$\n(2) $0 = 2\\lambda y - \\mu$\n(3) $0 = 2\\lambda z - \\mu$\n\nWe also have our two constraint equations:\n(4) $y^2 + z^2 = 1$\n(5) $x = y + z$\n\nWe proceed to solve this system of five equations for the variables $x, y, z, \\lambda, \\mu$.\nFrom equation (1), we immediately find that $\\mu = 1$.\n\nSubstitute $\\mu = 1$ into equations (2) and (3):\n(2') $0 = 2\\lambda y - 1 \\implies 2\\lambda y = 1$\n(3') $0 = 2\\lambda z - 1 \\implies 2\\lambda z = 1$\n\nFrom (2') and (3'), we can see that $2\\lambda y = 2\\lambda z$.
