If $x_{0}$ is a zero of $f$ with $f'(x_{0})\\neq 0$ (a simple zero), then by the implicit function theorem there is a unique zero of $f_{\\epsilon}$ near $x_{0}$ for all sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, so the local zero count near $x_{0}$ is stable. If instead $f'(x_{0})=0$, then the zero is degenerate; its local behavior depends on the first nonvanishing derivative. For an even multiplicity zero (e.g., $x^{2}$), a small vertical shift can eliminate the zero or create two nearby zeros; for an odd multiplicity zero (e.g., $x^{3}$), a single nearby zero persists for small $\\epsilon$.\n\nNow examine each option.\n\nFor $s_{A}$ with $f_{A}(x)=\\sin(x)$: the zero set is $\\{n\\pi\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$, all simple because $f_{A}'(n\\pi)=\\cos(n\\pi)=(-1)^{n}\\neq 0$.

Thus the number of zeros does not change under small vertical shifts, so $s_{A}$ is not unstable. Statement A is false.\n\nFor $s_{B}$ with $f_{B}(x)=x^{3}$: the zero set is $\\{0\\}$, with $f_{B}'(0)=0$ and $f_{B}''(0)=0$, but $f_{B}^{(3)}(0)=6\\neq 0$. For any real $\\epsilon\\neq 0$, $x^{3}+\\epsilon=0$ has exactly one real solution $x=(-\\epsilon)^{1/3}$. Hence the number of real zeros remains $1$ for all small $\\epsilon\\neq 0$, so $s_{B}$ is stable under the given notion. Therefore, claiming instability is incorrect, and citing $f_{B}''(0)=0$ does not rescue the claim. Statement B is false.\n\nFor $s_{C}$ with $f_{C}(x)=x^{2}$: the zero set is $\\{0\\}$, with $f_{C}'(0)=0$ and $f_{C}''(0)=2>0$. For $\\epsilon>0$, the equation $x^{2}+\\epsilon=0$ has no real solutions; for $\\epsilon0$, the equation $x^{2}-|\\epsilon|=0$ has two real solutions $x=\\pm\\sqrt{|\\epsilon|}$. Thus for arbitrarily small nonzero $\\epsilon$, the number of zeros of $f_{C}+\\epsilon$ is $0$ or $2$, both different from the original count $1$. Therefore $s_{C}$ is unstable. Moreover, the condition that holds at its zero is $f_{C}'(0)=0$ (a degenerate zero), as stated. Statement C is true.\n\nFor $s_{D}$ with $f_{D}(x)=x-x^{3}$: the zeros are $x\\in\\{-1,0,1\\}$, and each is simple because $f_{D}'(x)=1-3x^{2}$ gives $f_{D}'(0)=1 \\neq 0$ and $f_{D}'(\\pm 1)=-2 \\neq 0$. Hence, by the implicit function theorem, for sufficiently small $\\epsilon$ each zero persists uniquely nearby, so for all sufficiently small $\\epsilon$ the number of real zeros remains $3$. Therefore $s_{D}$ is stable; the claim that instability follows from the degree being greater than $1$ is incorrect. Statement D is false.\n\nFinally, statement E is false because $s_{C}$ is unstable as shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that $s_{C}$ is unstable, with the stated condition $f_{C}'(0)=0$ holding at its zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1680752"}]}
