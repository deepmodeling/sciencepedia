If $g$ is hyperbolic, it is conjugate in $\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ to $z \\mapsto \\lambda z$ with $\\lambda>1$, fixing $0$ and $\\infty$. Then $f:z \\mapsto \\mu z$ with $\\mu^{2}=\\lambda$ is also hyperbolic and satisfies $f^{2}=g$. Equivalently, in geometric terms, the translation length satisfies $\\ell(f^{2})=2\\ell(f)$, so choosing $\\ell(f)=\\frac{1}{2}\\ell(g)$ along the same axis gives $f^{2}=g$. Therefore, a hyperbolic translation can be a square root of a hyperbolic translation. Hence A is possible.\n\n2) Parabolic translation (B).

Using the same identity,\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(F^{2})=(\\mathrm{tr}(F))^{2}-2 \\in [-2,2),\n$$\nso $f^{2}$ is still elliptic (or the identity if the rotation angle doubles to $2\\pi$).

Hence E is impossible.\n\n5) Glide reflection (D). A glide reflection is the composition of a reflection $R$ about a geodesic $L$ and a hyperbolic translation $T$ along the same geodesic $L$. In this configuration $R$ and $T$ commute because $R$ fixes $L$ pointwise and preserves the direction along $L$, while $T$ preserves $L$ and translates along it. Therefore, for $f=R \\circ T$, one has\n$$\nf^{2}=(R \\circ T)\\circ(R \\circ T)=R \\circ T \\circ R \\circ T=(R^{2}) \\circ (T^{2})=T^{2},\n$$\nwhich is a hyperbolic translation along $L$ with twice the translation length of $T$.

Given any hyperbolic $g$ with axis $L$, choose $T$ to have half the translation length of $g$; then $(R \\circ T)^{2}=g$. Hence a glide reflection can be a square root of a hyperbolic translation.
