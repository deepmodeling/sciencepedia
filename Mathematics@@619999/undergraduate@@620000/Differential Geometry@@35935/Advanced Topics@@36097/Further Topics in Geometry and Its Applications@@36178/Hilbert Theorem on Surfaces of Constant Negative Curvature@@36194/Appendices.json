As the person moves, the rod is always taut and remains tangent to the path traced by the object. Let the position of the object at any time be given by the coordinates $(x, y)$. The path traced by the object is known as a tractrix.\n\nDetermine the expression for the slope of the object's path, $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, as a function of its vertical position $y$ and the rod length $L$.", "solution": "Let the object be at a point $P(x, y)$ on its path.
