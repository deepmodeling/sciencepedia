In our coordinate system, preserving the symplectic form means that if we express the form $\\omega$ in the new coordinates as $\\omega = dQ_1 \\wedge dP_1 + dQ_2 \\wedge dP_2$, this must be equivalent to the form in the old coordinates. This is achieved by calculating the differentials of the new coordinates in terms of the old ones and substituting them into the expression for $\\omega$.\n\nThe transformation is given by:\n$Q_1 = q_1 + \\alpha p_2$\n$Q_2 = q_2 + \\beta p_1$\n$P_1 = p_1$\n$P_2 = p_2$\n\nFirst, we find the differentials of the new coordinates $(Q_1, Q_2, P_1, P_2)$ in terms of the differentials of the old coordinates $(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2)$:\n$dQ_1 = d(q_1 + \\alpha p_2) = dq_1 + \\alpha dp_2$\n$dQ_2 = d(q_2 + \\beta p_1) = dq_2 + \\beta dp_1$\n$dP_1 = d(p_1) = dp_1$\n$dP_2 = d(p_2) = dp_2$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the symplectic form $\\omega$ written in the new coordinates, which is $\\Omega = dQ_1 \\wedge dP_1 + dQ_2 \\wedge dP_2$. This computation is effectively calculating the pullback $\\Phi^*\\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the standard symplectic form on the target space.\nWe compute each term separately:\n$dQ_1 \\wedge dP_1 = (dq_1 + \\alpha dp_2) \\wedge dp_1$\nUsing the distributive property and the anti-symmetry of the wedge product ($dp_2 \\wedge dp_1 = -dp_1 \\wedge dp_2$), we get:\n$dQ_1 \\wedge dP_1 = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + \\alpha (dp_2 \\wedge dp_1) = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 - \\alpha (dp_1 \\wedge dp_2)$\n\nNext, we compute the second term:\n$dQ_2 \\wedge dP_2 = (dq_2 + \\beta dp_1) \\wedge dp_2$\nUsing the distributive property, we get:\n$dQ_2 \\wedge dP_2 = dq_2 \\wedge dp_2 + \\beta (dp_1 \\wedge dp_2)$\n\nNow, we sum these two results to find the total form in the old coordinates:\n$\\Omega = (dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 - \\alpha dp_1 \\wedge dp_2) + (dq_2 \\wedge dp_2 + \\beta dp_1 \\wedge dp_2)$\n\nWe can regroup the terms:\n$\\Omega = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2 + (\\beta - \\alpha) dp_1 \\wedge dp_2$\n\nFor the transformation $\\Phi$ to be a symplectomorphism, this resulting form $\\Omega$ must be identical to the original symplectic form $\\omega = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2$.\nSo, we must have:\n$dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2 + (\\beta - \\alpha) dp_1 \\wedge dp_2 = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2$\n\nThis equality holds if and only if the additional term is zero:\n$(\\beta - \\alpha) dp_1 \\wedge dp_2 = 0$\n\nSince the 2-form $dp_1 \\wedge dp_2$ is not identically zero on the manifold (it forms a basis element for 2-forms), its coefficient must be zero.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$\\beta - \\alpha = 0$\n$\\beta = \\alpha$\n\nThis is the condition on the constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.

Since the determinant is non-zero, the map is a local diffeomorphism. The transformation is also clearly invertible for any $\\alpha, \\beta$: $p_1=P_1, p_2=P_2, q_1=Q_1-\\alpha P_2, q_2=Q_2-\\beta P_1$.
