The gradient is given by $\\nabla V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\right)$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\alpha x^2 + \\beta y^4) = 2\\alpha x $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\alpha x^2 + \\beta y^4) = 4\\beta y^3 $$\nSetting both partial derivatives to zero gives the system of equations:\n$$ 2\\alpha x = 0 $$\n$$ 4\\beta y^3 = 0 $$\nSince $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are given as positive constants, the only solution to this system is $x=0$ and $y=0$. Thus, the origin $(0,0)$ is the only critical point of the function $V(x,y)$. This immediately rules out option E.\n\nNext, we determine if this critical point is degenerate or non-degenerate. This requires calculating the Hessian matrix, $H$, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n$$ H(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2\\alpha x) = 2\\alpha $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(4\\beta y^3) = 12\\beta y^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(4\\beta y^3) = 0 $$\nBy Clairaut's theorem, $\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$.\nSo the Hessian matrix is:\n$$ H(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & 12\\beta y^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian at the critical point $(0,0)$:\n$$ H(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & 12\\beta (0)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nA critical point is non-degenerate if the determinant of its Hessian is non-zero. Let's compute the determinant of $H(0,0)$:\n$$ \\det(H(0,0)) = (2\\alpha)(0) - (0)(0) = 0 $$\nSince the determinant of the Hessian at the origin is zero, the critical point $(0,0)$ is degenerate. This eliminates options A and C.\n\nFinally, we need to classify the degenerate critical point as either a local minimum or a saddle point. The standard second derivative test (based on the Hessian) is inconclusive for degenerate points, so we must inspect the function's behavior near the origin directly.\nThe function is $V(x, y) = \\alpha x^2 + \\beta y^4$. At the critical point, the potential is $V(0,0) = 0$.\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$, the term $\\alpha x^2$ is always non-negative, and the term $\\beta y^4$ is also always non-negative.\nTherefore, their sum $V(x, y) = \\alpha x^2 + \\beta y^4 \\ge 0$ for any point $(x,y)$.\nThis means that for any point $(x,y)$ in a neighborhood of the origin (other than the origin itself), $V(x,y) > V(0,0)$. This is the definition of a strict local minimum.\nSo, the critical point at $(0,0)$ is a local minimum.\n\nCombining our findings, the critical point at the origin is a degenerate local minimum.
