The path is a horizontal line segment from $P_1 = (x_0, y_0)$ to $P_2 = (x_0 + L, y_0)$. A convenient parameterization is to use a parameter $t$ that ranges from $0$ to $1$. We can define the path $\\gamma(t)$ as:\n$$x(t) = x_0 + Lt$$\n$$y(t) = y_0$$\nFor $t \\in [0, 1]$. At $t=0$, we have $(x(0), y(0)) = (x_0, y_0) = P_1$.
