The hyperbolic radius $R_H$ is the hyperbolic distance from the origin to any point on the circle. Due to the symmetry of the metric, the shortest path (a geodesic) from the origin to a point on a circle of Euclidean radius $R_E$ is a straight Euclidean line segment.\n\nLet's calculate the hyperbolic length of a radial line segment from the origin $(0,0)$ to a point on the Euclidean circle of radius $R_E$. We can choose the point $(R_E, 0)$ without loss of generality. This path can be parameterized by $x(t) = t$ and $y(t) = 0$ for $t \\in [0, R_E]$.\n\nFor this path, the differentials are $dx = dt$ and $dy = 0$. The squared Euclidean distance from the origin at any point along the path is $x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = t^2$.
