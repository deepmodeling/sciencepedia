This exercise invites you to derive this behavior firsthand by solving the Jacobi equation in this context, revealing the mathematical underpinnings of this dramatic geometric phenomenon [@problem_id:1648359].", "problem": "A pseudosphere is a surface characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature, $K$. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider a specific pseudosphere where $K=-1$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a geodesic on this surface, parameterized by arc length $t$.\n\nIn differential geometry, a Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ describes the infinitesimal variation of a family of geodesics. It essentially measures how nearby geodesics spread apart or converge. We are interested in a particular Jacobi field that is normal to the geodesic. This means the Jacobi field $J(t)$ is orthogonal to the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$ for all $t$, i.e., $\\langle J(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ represents the inner product on the tangent plane at the point $\\gamma(t)$.\n\nSuch a normal Jacobi field can be uniquely described in the form $J(t) = f(t)E(t)$, where $E(t)$ is a unit vector field that is parallel-transported along $\\gamma(t)$ and is also orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$. The scalar function $f(t)$ represents the magnitude of the Jacobi field at each point along the geodesic.\n\nGiven the initial conditions that at $t=0$, the magnitude of the field is $f(0)=1$ and its rate of change is $f'(0)=0$, determine the function $f(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude function $f(t)$ of a normal Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ on a surface with constant Gaussian curvature $K=-1$.\n\nThe fundamental equation governing a Jacobi field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\nabla_{\\gamma'} J + R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor of the surface.\n\nTo solve this, we set up a convenient local frame. Since $\\gamma(t)$ is a unit-speed geodesic, its tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$ has a constant length of 1. Let's define an orthonormal frame $\\{E_1(t), E_2(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma(t)$ such that:\n1.  $E_1(t) = \\gamma'(t)$.\n2.  $E_2(t)$ is a unit vector field orthogonal to $E_1(t)$.\nBy parallel transporting an arbitrary normal vector at $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma(t)$, we can construct $E_2(t)$ to be a parallel vector field. Thus, we have a parallel orthonormal frame (a Darboux frame) where $\\nabla_{\\gamma'} E_1 = 0$ (since $\\gamma$ is a geodesic) and we construct $E_2$ such that $\\nabla_{\\gamma'} E_2 = 0$. The field $E(t)$ in the problem statement is precisely this $E_2(t)$.\n\nThe problem states that the Jacobi field $J(t)$ is normal to $\\gamma(t)$, so it can be written as a scalar multiple of $E_2(t)$:\n$$\nJ(t) = f(t)E_2(t)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this form of $J(t)$ into the Jacobi equation. We compute the terms one by one.\n\nFirst, the covariant derivative term $\\nabla_{\\gamma'} J$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'} J = \\nabla_{\\gamma'} (f(t)E_2(t))\n$$\nUsing the product rule for covariant differentiation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'} J = \\frac{d}{dt}(f(t)) E_2(t) + f(t) \\nabla_{\\gamma'} E_2(t)\n$$\nSince $E_2(t)$ is parallel-transported along $\\gamma(t)$, we have $\\nabla_{\\gamma'} E_2(t) = 0$. So, the first derivative simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'} J = f'(t)E_2(t)\n$$\nNext, we compute the second covariant derivative $\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\nabla_{\\gamma'} J$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\nabla_{\\gamma'} J = \\nabla_{\\gamma'} (f'(t)E_2(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}(f'(t)) E_2(t) + f'(t) \\nabla_{\\gamma'} E_2(t)\n$$\nAgain, since $\\nabla_{\\gamma'} E_2(t) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\nabla_{\\gamma'} J = f''(t)E_2(t)\n$$\nNow we analyze the curvature term, $R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma'$. Substituting $J=f(t)E_2(t)$ and $\\gamma'=E_1(t)$:\n$$\nR(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = R(f(t)E_2(t), E_1(t))E_1(t)\n$$\nBy the properties of the Riemann tensor, this is:\n$$\nR(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = f(t) R(E_2(t), E_1(t))E_1(t)\n$$\nFor a 2-dimensional surface, the Gaussian curvature $K$ is related to the Riemann tensor by $K = \\langle R(E_1, E_2)E_2, E_1 \\rangle$ for any orthonormal basis $\\{E_1, E_2\\}$. A standard result in surface theory is that for such an orthonormal basis, $R(E_2, E_1)E_1 = K E_2$.\nSubstituting this into the curvature term expression:\n$$\nR(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = f(t) (K E_2(t)) = K f(t) E_2(t)\n$$\nNow we substitute the computed terms back into the Jacobi equation:\n$$\nf''(t)E_2(t) + K f(t) E_2(t) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(f''(t) + K f(t))E_2(t) = 0\n$$\nSince $E_2(t)$ is a non-zero vector, its scalar coefficient must be zero:\n$$\nf''(t) + K f(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is the general differential equation for the magnitude of a normal Jacobi field on a surface with Gaussian curvature $K$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the pseudosphere has a constant Gaussian curvature $K=-1$. Substituting this value, we obtain the specific differential equation for $f(t)$:\n$$\nf''(t) - f(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1 = 0$, which has roots $r_1 = 1$ and $r_2 = -1$.\nThe general solution is therefore:\n$$\nf(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^{-t}\n$$\nfor some constants $c_1$ and $c_2$. To find these constants, we use the given initial conditions: $f(0)=1$ and $f'(0)=0$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of $f(t)$:\n$$\nf'(t) = c_1 e^t - c_2 e^{-t}\n$$\nNow we apply the initial conditions:\n1.  $f(0) = c_1 e^0 + c_2 e^{-0} = c_1 + c_2 = 1$\n2.  $f'(0) = c_1 e^0 - c_2 e^{-0} = c_1 - c_2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, $c_1 = c_2$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:\n$c_1 + c_1 = 1 \\implies 2c_1 = 1 \\implies c_1 = 1/2$.\nTherefore, $c_2 = 1/2$ as well.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the general solution, we find the specific function $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\frac{1}{2}e^t + \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t}\n$$\nThis expression is the definition of the hyperbolic cosine function.\n$$\nf(t) = \\cosh(t)\n$$\nThis function describes how the distance between the central geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ and a nearby, initially parallel geodesic, grows exponentially over time, a hallmark of negatively curved spaces.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\cosh(t)} $$", "id": "1648359"}, {"introduction": "In stark contrast to the dispersive nature of negative curvature, positively curved surfaces like a sphere cause geodesics to reconverge.
