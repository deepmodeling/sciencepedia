A manifold that satisfies the hypotheses of this theorem is known as a Cartan-Hadamard manifold.

The three conditions for a connected Riemannian manifold to be a Cartan-Hadamard manifold are:\n1. It must be a complete manifold.\n2. It must be simply connected.\n3. Its sectional curvature must be non-positive everywhere ($K \\le 0$).\n\nLet's examine each of these conditions for the standard $n$-sphere $S^n$ with its round metric.\n\n**Condition 1: Completeness**\nA fundamental result in Riemannian geometry is that any compact Riemannian manifold is also a complete manifold. The $n$-sphere $S^n$ is defined as a closed and bounded subset of Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. By the Heine-Borel theorem, this means $S^n$ is compact. Therefore, $S^n$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. This means statement A is incorrect.\n\n**Condition 2: Simply Connected**\nA space is simply connected if its fundamental group is trivial. For the $n$-sphere, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^n)$ is trivial if and only if $n \\ge 2$. Since the problem explicitly states that we are considering the case where $n \\ge 2$, the $n$-sphere is indeed simply connected. For example, $\\pi_1(S^2) = \\{0\\}$, $\\pi_1(S^3) = \\{0\\}$, and so on. Therefore, $S^n$ satisfies the simply connected condition for $n \\ge 2$. This means statement B is incorrect.\n\n**Condition 3: Non-positive Sectional Curvature**\nThe standard $n$-sphere of radius $R=1$ is a classic example of a space with constant curvature. For any point on $S^n$ and any 2-dimensional plane in its tangent space, the sectional curvature $K$ is constant and positive, given by the formula $K = 1/R^2$. In our case, $R=1$, so the sectional curvature is $K = +1$. The condition for a Cartan-Hadamard manifold requires the sectional curvature to be non-positive, i.e., $K \\le 0$. Since the sectional curvature of $S^n$ is strictly positive ($K=+1$), this condition is violated. This is the reason why $S^n$ is not a Cartan-Hadamard manifold. This means statement C is correct.\n\n**Analyzing the other options:**\nStatement D states that the metric is degenerate at the poles. This is false. The standard round metric on $S^n$ is a well-defined, non-degenerate Riemannian metric at every point. Confusion on this point sometimes arises from certain coordinate systems (like spherical coordinates) having singularities at the poles, but the metric tensor itself is smooth and non-degenerate everywhere when considered properly (e.g., as an induced metric from $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$).\n\nStatement E is nonsensical. The Cartan-Hadamard theorem applies to finite-dimensional manifolds.\n\nConclusion: The only condition that fails for the standard $n$-sphere ($n \\ge 2$) is the requirement of non-positive sectional curvature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1668892"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the importance of the curvature condition, we now turn our attention to a space that is geometrically flat: the infinite cylinder. This example isolates the role of topology, as the cylinder is complete and has zero sectional curvature, yet it is not diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This exercise [@problem_id:1668902] demonstrates that even with ideal local geometry, global topological properties—specifically, the failure to be simply connected—can prevent a manifold from having the simple structure of Euclidean space.", "problem": "The Cartan-Hadamard theorem is a foundational result in Riemannian geometry.

The problem states that $M$ is equipped with the standard flat product metric. A \"flat\" Riemannian manifold is one where the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, the sectional curvature $K$, which is derived from the curvature tensor, is also identically zero for all 2-dimensional subspaces of any tangent space. Since $K=0$, the condition of non-positive sectional curvature ($K \\le 0$) is satisfied everywhere. This eliminates option B, which incorrectly claims the existence of positive curvature.\n\nSecond, we consider completeness. The problem statement asserts that the manifold is complete. To verify this, we can think about geodesics on the cylinder. The universal cover of the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and the covering map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a local isometry. Geodesics in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are straight lines, which can be extended indefinitely in both directions. The geodesics on the cylinder are the projections of these straight lines. Since the geodesics in the covering space are complete, the geodesics on the cylinder are also complete. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a manifold on which all geodesics can be extended for all values of their parameter is a complete metric space. Therefore, $M$ is complete. This eliminates option A. The completeness of $M$ also implies, by the Hopf-Rinow theorem, that the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_pM \\to M$ is defined on the entire tangent space for any $p \\in M$, which eliminates option E.\n\nThird, we examine the simple-connectedness of $M$. A space is simply connected if it is path-connected and its fundamental group is trivial. The manifold $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is clearly path-connected. To find its fundamental group, we use the property that the fundamental group of a product of spaces is the product of their individual fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(A \\times B) \\cong \\pi_1(A) \\times \\pi_1(B)$.\nIn our case, $A = S^1$ (the circle) and $B = \\mathbb{R}$ (the real line).\nThe fundamental group of the circle is the group of integers, $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is because of the existence of non-contractible loops that wind around the circle.\nThe real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is a contractible space, so its fundamental group is the trivial group, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\{0\\}$.\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the cylinder is $\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince the fundamental group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not the trivial group, the manifold $M$ is not simply connected. This is the hypothesis of the Cartan-Hadamard theorem that fails. This makes option C the correct answer.\n\nFinally, option D is incorrect because the problem statement explicitly defines $M$ as a Riemannian manifold by equipping it with a metric.\n\nIn summary, the cylinder $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a complete, connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature, but it is not simply connected.

An open disk is a path-connected set, meaning any two points within the disk can be joined by a continuous path (for instance, a straight line segment) that lies entirely within the disk. A path-connected space is always connected. Therefore, the hypothesis that $M$ is connected is satisfied.\n\n**B. $M$ is simply connected.**\nA space is simply connected if it is path-connected and its fundamental group is trivial. This means every closed loop in the space can be continuously shrunk to a point within that space. The open disk $M$ is a contractible space. Any closed curve drawn inside the disk can be continuously deformed to a single point without leaving the disk. This implies that the fundamental group of $M$ is trivial, $\\pi_1(M) = \\{0\\}$. Since $M$ is also path-connected, it is simply connected. Therefore, this hypothesis is satisfied.\n\n**C. The sectional curvature of $M$ is non-positive ($K \\le 0$) everywhere.**\nThe metric on $M$ is the standard Euclidean metric, $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$, inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This metric is \"flat\". In Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$, the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ are constant ($g_{11}=1$, $g_{22}=1$, $g_{12}=0$). Consequently, all the Christoffel symbols, which involve derivatives of the metric components, are identically zero. The Riemann curvature tensor, which is constructed from the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives, is therefore also identically zero everywhere on $M$. The sectional curvature $K$ is calculated from the Riemann curvature tensor. Since the Riemann tensor is zero, the sectional curvature $K$ is identically zero on all of $M$. The condition $K \\le 0$ is thus satisfied (as $0 \\le 0$). Therefore, this hypothesis is satisfied.\n\n**D. $M$ is a complete Riemannian manifold.**\nA Riemannian manifold is defined as complete if it is complete as a metric space, with the distance function induced by the Riemannian metric. For the open unit disk with the standard Euclidean metric, the induced distance is just the usual Euclidean distance between points. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space converges to a limit that is also in the space.\n\nLet's construct a sequence of points in $M$. Consider the sequence $p_n = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}, 0\\right)$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. For every $n$, the distance of $p_n$ from the origin is $1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}$, which is strictly less than 1. So, every point $p_n$ is in the open unit disk $M$.\n\nThis sequence is a Cauchy sequence. The distance between two points in the sequence is:\n$$d(p_m, p_k) = \\left| \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m+1}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k+1}\\right) \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1}{k+1} - \\frac{1}{m+1} \\right|$$\nAs $m, k \\to \\infty$, this distance approaches 0. Thus, the sequence is Cauchy.\n\nNow, let's find the limit of this sequence. As $n \\to \\infty$, the point $p_n$ approaches the limit point $p = (1, 0)$. The point $p = (1,0)$ has a distance of 1 from the origin, so it lies on the boundary of the disk, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This means the limit point $p$ is not an element of the open disk $M$.\n\nSince we have found a Cauchy sequence in $M$ whose limit is not in $M$, the manifold $M$ is not a complete metric space. Therefore, the hypothesis that $M$ is a complete Riemannian manifold is not satisfied.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only hypothesis of the Cartan-Hadamard theorem that fails for the open unit disk with the Euclidean metric is its completeness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1668870"}]}
