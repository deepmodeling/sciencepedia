We will check each of the three properties by direct substitution and algebraic manipulation.\n\n**Checking Property (I): Antisymmetry in the first two indices**\nThis property requires that $T_{abcd} = -T_{bacd}$. We start by constructing $T_{bacd}$ by swapping the indices $a$ and $b$ in the definition of $T_{abcd}$:\n$$T_{bacd} = g_{bc}g_{ad} - g_{bd}g_{ac}$$\nNow, we can factor out a negative sign from this expression:\n$$T_{bacd} = -(g_{bd}g_{ac} - g_{bc}g_{ad})$$\nRecognizing that the terms inside the parentheses are just reordered, we can write:\n$$T_{bacd} = -(g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc})$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is the definition of $T_{abcd}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$T_{bacd} = -T_{abcd}$$\nThis is equivalent to $T_{abcd} = -T_{bacd}$.

Therefore, we have:\n$$T_{abdc} = -T_{abcd}$$\nThis is equivalent to $T_{abcd} = -T_{abdc}$. Thus, Property (II) is satisfied.\n\n**Checking Property (III): The first Bianchi identity**\nThis property requires that the cyclic sum $T_{abcd} + T_{acdb} + T_{adbc}$ equals zero. We need to write out each term explicitly. The indices are permuted cyclically: $(b \\to c \\to d \\to b)$.\n\nThe first term is given:\n$$T_{abcd} = g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc}$$\nFor the second term, $T_{acdb}$, we apply the permutation to the indices of $T_{abcd}$:\n$$T_{acdb} = g_{ad}g_{cb} - g_{ab}g_{cd}$$\nUsing the symmetry of the metric tensor ($g_{cb} = g_{bc}$), this becomes:\n$$T_{acdb} = g_{ad}g_{bc} - g_{ab}g_{cd}$$\nFor the third term, $T_{adbc}$, we apply the permutation again to the indices of $T_{acdb}$:\n$$T_{adbc} = g_{ab}g_{dc} - g_{ac}g_{db}$$\nUsing the symmetry of the metric tensor ($g_{dc} = g_{cd}$ and $g_{db} = g_{bd}$), this becomes:\n$$T_{adbc} = g_{ab}g_{cd} - g_{ac}g_{bd}$$\nNow, we sum the three terms:\n$$T_{abcd} + T_{acdb} + T_{adbc} = (g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc}) + (g_{ad}g_{bc} - g_{ab}g_{cd}) + (g_{ab}g_{cd} - g_{ac}g_{bd})$$\nLet's collect and cancel the terms:\n$$= g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc} + g_{ad}g_{bc} - g_{ab}g_{cd} + g_{ab}g_{cd}$$\n$$= 0$$\nThe sum is zero.

The first Bianchi identity is a derived property that may not hold in all spacetimes.\n\nB. No, because any tensor that satisfies the two given symmetries must also be antisymmetric in its second pair of indices ($P_{abcd} = -P_{abdc}$), a property which was not mentioned and is likely violated.\n\nC.

Starting with $P_{abcd}$, apply pair interchange to obtain\n$$\nP_{abcd} = P_{cdab}.\n$$\nNow apply antisymmetry in the first pair (with indices $c$ and $d$ as that first pair) to get\n$$\nP_{cdab} = - P_{dcab}.\n$$\nFinally, apply pair interchange again to the last expression to obtain\n$$\nP_{dcab} = P_{abdc}.\n$$\nCombining these equalities yields\n$$\nP_{abcd} = - P_{abdc},\n$$\nso $P_{abcd}$ is automatically antisymmetric in its second pair of indices.
