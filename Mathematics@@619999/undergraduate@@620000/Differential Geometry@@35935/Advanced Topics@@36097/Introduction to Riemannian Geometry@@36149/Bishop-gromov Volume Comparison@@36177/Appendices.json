This is a direct application of the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem.\n\nThe Bishop-Gromov theorem states that if $(M^n, g)$ is an $n$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature satisfying $Ric \\ge (n-1)k$ for some constant $k$, then the function\n$$f(r) = \\frac{Vol(B_p(r))}{Vol_{k,n}(r)}$$\nis a non-increasing function of the radius $r  0$. Here, $Vol_{k,n}(r)$ is the volume of a geodesic ball of radius $r$ in the $n$-dimensional simply connected space form of constant sectional curvature $k$.\n\nFirst, we identify the parameters from the problem statement:\n- The dimension of the manifold is $n=3$.\n- The Ricci curvature is bounded below by $Ric \\ge 2g$. We compare this with the general form $Ric \\ge (n-1)k g$.\n- Substituting $n=3$, we have $Ric \\ge (3-1)k g = 2k g$.\n- The problem gives $Ric \\ge 2g$, so by comparing the two inequalities, we find that the constant curvature for our comparison space is $k=1$.\n\nSince $k=1  0$, the comparison space is the standard $n$-sphere of constant sectional curvature 1.
