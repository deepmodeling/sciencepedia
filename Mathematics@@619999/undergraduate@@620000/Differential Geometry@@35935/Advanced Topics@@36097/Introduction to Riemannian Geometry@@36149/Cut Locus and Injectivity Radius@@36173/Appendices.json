Since $||(v_{i})|| < r$ and $||(w_{i})|| < r$ for each $i$ (because $||(v_{1},v_{2})|| < r$ implies $||v_{i}|| < r$), the exponential maps in each factor are injective on their respective balls $B_{r}(0)$, hence $v_{1} = w_{1}$ and $v_{2} = w_{2}$.

For $M_{2} = \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the Euclidean metric, the exponential map at any point is the global translation $\\exp_{p_{2}}^{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(v_{2}) = p_{2} + v_{2}$, which is a global diffeomorphism; hence\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}_{p_{2}}(\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = +\\infty.\n$$\nFor $M_{1} = S^{1}(R)$, geodesics are great circles parametrized by arclength; the exponential map at $p_{1}$ sends a tangent vector $v_{1} \\in T_{p_{1}}S^{1}(R)$ with $||v_{1}|| = s$ to the point at arclength $s$ from $p_{1}$ along the circle in the corresponding direction. Since $S^{1}(R)$ is closed of circumference $2\\pi R$, the first point where injectivity fails is at the antipodal point, reached at arclength $\\pi R$, and indeed $\\exp_{p_{1}}^{S^{1}(R)}(v_{1}) = \\exp_{p_{1}}^{S^{1}(R)}(-v_{1})$ when $||v_{1}|| = \\pi R$.
