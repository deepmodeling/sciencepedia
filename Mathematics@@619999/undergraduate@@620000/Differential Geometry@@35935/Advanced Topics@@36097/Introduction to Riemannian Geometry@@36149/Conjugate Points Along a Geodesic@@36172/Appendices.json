The Jacobi field must satisfy the Jacobi equation and a given set of initial conditions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the Jacobi equation in the context of Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is flat, which means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. That is, $R(X, Y)Z = 0$ for any vector fields $X, Y, Z$. Consequently, the term $R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ in the Jacobi equation vanishes. The Jacobi equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t) = 0\n$$\n\nNext, we need to compute the covariant derivative $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ in Euclidean space using standard Cartesian coordinates. For any vector field $V(t)$ along a curve $\\gamma(t)$, the covariant derivative is given by $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V = \\frac{dV^k}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij}\\dot{\\gamma}^iV^j$, where $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols. In standard Cartesian coordinates for $\\mathbb{R}^3$, all Christoffel symbols are zero, i.e., $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$. Thus, the covariant derivative along $\\gamma(t)$ is simply the ordinary component-wise differentiation with respect to the parameter $t$.\n\nLet the Jacobi field be denoted by its components $J(t) = (J_x(t), J_y(t), J_z(t))$.
