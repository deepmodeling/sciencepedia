This fundamental theorem in Riemannian geometry states that a Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if and only if it is complete as a metric space with the distance function induced by the Riemannian metric.\n\nLet $d_g$ be the distance function on $M$ induced by the metric $g$, and let $d_{\\tilde{g}}$ be the distance function induced by the metric $\\tilde{g}$. The distance between two points $p, q \\in M$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting $p$ and $q$.\n\nLet $\\gamma: [a, b] \\to M$ be an arbitrary piecewise smooth curve from $p=\\gamma(a)$ to $q=\\gamma(b)$. The length of this curve with respect to the metric $g$ is given by:\n$$L_g(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} \\, dt$$\nThe length of the same curve with respect to the metric $\\tilde{g}$ is:\n$$L_{\\tilde{g}}(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\tilde{g}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} \\, dt$$\nUsing the definition $\\tilde{g} = c g$, we have:\n$$L_{\\tilde{g}}(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{c \\cdot g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} \\, dt = \\sqrt{c} \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} \\, dt = \\sqrt{c} L_g(\\gamma)$$\nSince this relationship holds for any curve, the infimum over all such curves will also be related by the same factor. Therefore, the distance functions are related by:\n$$d_{\\tilde{g}}(p, q) = \\sqrt{c} \\, d_g(p, q)$$\nfor all $p, q \\in M$.\n\nNow we investigate the completeness of the metric spaces $(M, d_g)$ and $(M, d_{\\tilde{g}})$. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in it converges to a point in the space.\n\nFirst, let's show that a sequence $\\{p_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $M$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to $d_g$ if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence with respect to $d_{\\tilde{g}}$.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_g)$. This means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, $d_g(p_n, p_m)  \\epsilon$.\nNow consider the distance in $(M, d_{\\tilde{g}})$. For $m, n > N$, we have $d_{\\tilde{g}}(p_n, p_m) = \\sqrt{c} \\, d_g(p_n, p_m)  \\sqrt{c} \\epsilon$.\nGiven any $\\epsilon' > 0$, we can choose $\\epsilon = \\epsilon'/\\sqrt{c}$. Then for $m, n > N$, we have $d_{\\tilde{g}}(p_n, p_m)  \\epsilon'$, which shows that $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_{\\tilde{g}})$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_{\\tilde{g}})$. This means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, $d_{\\tilde{g}}(p_n, p_m)  \\epsilon$.\nThen, for $m, n > N$, we have $d_g(p_n, p_m) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} d_{\\tilde{g}}(p_n, p_m)  \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{c}}$.\nThis shows that $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_g)$.\nThus, the set of Cauchy sequences is the same for both metric spaces.\n\nNext, we need to check if convergence is affected. A sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ converges to a limit $p \\in M$ if the distance between $p_n$ and $p$ approaches zero.\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} d_g(p_n, p) = 0 \\iff \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{c} \\, d_g(p_n, p) = 0 \\iff \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} d_{\\tilde{g}}(p_n, p) = 0$$\nSo, a sequence converges to a limit $p$ in $(M, d_g)$ if and only if it converges to the same limit $p$ in $(M, d_{\\tilde{g}})$.\n\nCombining these results, we see that every Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_g)$ converges if and only if every Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_{\\tilde{g}})$ converges. This means that $(M, d_g)$ is a complete metric space if and only if $(M, d_{\\tilde{g}})$ is a complete metric space.\n\nBy the Hopf-Rinow theorem, the geodesic completeness of a Riemannian manifold is equivalent to the completeness of its induced metric space. Therefore, the Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is geodesically complete if and only if the Riemannian manifold $(M, \\tilde{g})$ is geodesically complete.

The unique straight line through $p$ and $q$ is the $x$-axis, which is not contained in $M$ since it includes the origin.
