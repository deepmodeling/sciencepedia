Understanding this potential pitfall is essential for correctly constructing and manipulating smooth functions [@problem_id:1626208].", "problem": "In differential geometry, a bump function is a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is both smooth (infinitely differentiable, or $C^\\infty$) and has compact support. The support of a function is defined as the closure of the set of points where the function is non-zero.

We define a new function $g(x) = \\sqrt{\\psi(x)}$. The question is whether $g(x)$ must also be a bump function.\n\nFor context, a zero $x_0$ of a smooth function $f(x)$ is said to be of infinite order if all derivatives of $f$ vanish at $x_0$, i.e., $f^{(k)}(x_0) = 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 0$.\n\nWhich one of the following statements about the function $g(x) = \\sqrt{\\psi(x)}$ is necessarily true?\n\nA. $g(x)$ is always a bump function, regardless of the properties of $\\psi(x)$.\n\nB. $g(x)$ is never a bump function for any non-trivial $\\psi(x)$ (i.e., for any $\\psi(x)$ that is not identically zero).\n\nC. $g(x)$ is always smooth, but its support is not guaranteed to be compact.\n\nD. $g(x)$ is not guaranteed to be a bump function because it may fail to be differentiable at the zeros of $\\psi(x)$.\n\nE. $g(x)$ is a bump function if and only if every zero of $\\psi(x)$ is a zero of infinite order.", "solution": "Let $\\psi:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be a nonnegative bump function and define $g(x)=\\sqrt{\\psi(x)}$. First, observe the support relation. For any $x$, $\\psi(x)=0$ if and only if $g(x)=0$, and $\\psi(x)>0$ if and only if $g(x)>0$. Hence\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp}(g)=\\operatorname{supp}(\\psi),\n$$\nso compactness of support is preserved. Therefore, any failure of $g$ to be a bump function can only come from a failure of smoothness, not from loss of compactness.\n\nAway from the zero set $\\{x:\\psi(x)=0\\}$, the function $g$ is smooth because it is the composition of the smooth function $\\psi$ with the smooth function $t \\mapsto t^{1/2}$ on $(0,\\infty)$. Thus, any lack of smoothness can occur only at zeros of $\\psi$.\n\nFix a zero $x_{0}$ of $\\psi$.

It is standard (and checked by piecewise differentiation) that $|x|^{k}$ is $C^{r}$ if and only if $r\\le k-1$ when $k$ is odd, while $|x|^{k}$ is $C^{\\infty}$ when $k$ is even. Consequently, if $k$ is odd (equivalently, if the finite order $m$ is $2$ modulo $4$), $g$ fails to be differentiable at $x_{0}$.\n\nA concrete example exhibits this failure: take $x_{0}=0$ and let $\\chi$ be a nonnegative smooth function with compact support and $\\chi(0)>0$.

Since $\\operatorname{supp}(g)=\\operatorname{supp}(\\psi)$, option C is false. Option A is false by the example above. Option B is false because there exist $\\psi$ for which $g$ is a bump, e.g., if $\\psi=h^{2}$ with $h\\ge 0$ smooth and compactly supported, then $g=\\sqrt{\\psi}=h$ is a bump. Option E is false because zeros of $\\psi$ of finite order divisible by $4$ already yield smoothness of $g$ at that zero (e.g., $\\psi(x)=x^{4}\\chi(x)$ gives $g(x)=x^{2}\\sqrt{\\chi(x)}$ smooth), so infinite order is not necessary.\n\nTherefore, the necessarily true statement is that $g$ may fail to be differentiable at zeros of $\\psi$, so it is not guaranteed to be a bump function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1626208"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their theoretical importance in analysis, bump functions are powerful tools for construction in differential geometry.
