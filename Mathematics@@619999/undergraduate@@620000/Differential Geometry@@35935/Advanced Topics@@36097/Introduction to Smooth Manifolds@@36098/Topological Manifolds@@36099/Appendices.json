By working through this, you will gain a concrete understanding of how a curved surface can be locally described using familiar Cartesian coordinates, a foundational idea in manifold theory.", "problem": "In the field of cartography, stereographic projection is a method used to map a sphere onto a plane. Consider a model of a planet as a perfect sphere $S^2$ in three-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, centered at the origin, with a radius $R>0$. The equation of the sphere is thus $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2$. A cartographer sets up a projection from the sphere's \"North Pole\", the point $N=(0,0,R)$, to the equatorial plane, defined by $z=0$. For any point $P=(x,y,z)$ on the sphere (excluding the North Pole), its projected image, which we denote as $Q=(u,v,0)$, is found by drawing a straight line from $N$ through $P$ and finding where this line intersects the plane $z=0$.\n\nTo create a complete mapping tool, the cartographer needs to know how to reverse this process: given a point $(u,v)$ on the map (i.e., the point $Q=(u,v,0)$ in the plane), what are the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ of the original point $P$ on the planet's surface?\n\nDetermine the expressions for the coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$ of the point $P$ on the sphere in terms of the map coordinates $u$, $v$, and the planet's radius $R$.", "solution": "Let $S^{2}$ be the sphere $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=R^{2}$ and $N=(0,0,R)$.
