At $(0,0)$ we have $\\nabla f(0,0)=(0,0)$, so $0$ is not a regular value globally and the Preimage Theorem does not apply to conclude that $S$ is an embedded submanifold.\n\nMore fundamentally, $S$ fails to be a topological $1$-manifold at the origin. In the subspace topology on $S$, any neighborhood $U$ of $(0,0)$ has $U\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ equal to the union of four disjoint open rays (two along the $x$-axis and two along the $y$-axis), hence $U\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ has four connected components. By contrast, for any open interval $I\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ and any $t_{0}\\in I$, the set $I\\setminus\\{t_{0}\\}$ has exactly two connected components. Since the number of connected components after removing a point is a topological invariant preserved by homeomorphisms, no neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $S$ is homeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $S$ is not locally Euclidean of dimension $1$ at $(0,0)$ and hence is not a topological manifold, let alone an embedded submanifold.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is false because at the origin there is no neighborhood in $S$ that is the image of a smooth embedding of an interval (its image would be locally homeomorphic to an open interval, which $S$ is not at $(0,0)$).\n- B is false because $0$ is not a regular value of $f$ (the differential vanishes at $(0,0)$), so the Preimage Theorem does not apply.\n- C is false because $S$ is not even a topological manifold.\n- D is correct: $S$ fails to be a topological manifold at the origin, so it is not an embedded submanifold.\n\nThus the most accurate conclusion is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1636923"}]}
