Let's choose a simple interval, for example, by picking $a=1/3$ and $b=2/3$. Note that $1/4 < 1/3 < 2/3 < 3/4$, so $[1/3, 2/3] \\subset (1/4, 3/4)$.\n\nWe can define our functions as follows:\n- On the interval $[0, 1/3]$, we can set $\\phi_2(x)=0$.

This implies $\\phi_2(x)=1$.\n- On the interval $(1/3, 2/3)$, both functions can be non-zero. We need to define them to ensure continuity at $x=1/3$ and $x=2/3$.

On $[1/3, 2/3]$, it decreases linearly from $1$ to $0$, so its range is within $[0,1]$.\n\nWe can find $\\phi_2(x)$ using $\\phi_2(x) = 1-\\phi_1(x)$:\n$$\n\\phi_2(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1/3 \\\\ 1 - (-3x + 2) = 3x - 1 & \\text{if } 1/3 < x < 2/3 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } 2/3 \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet's perform a final check of the support conditions:\n- For $\\phi_1(x)$: The set where $\\phi_1(x) \\neq 0$ is $[0, 2/3)$. The closure of this set (the support) is $[0, 2/3]$. We need to check if $[0, 2/3] \\subset U_1 = [0, 3/4)$. Since $2/3 \\approx 0.667$ and $3/4 = 0.75$, the condition $2/3  3/4$ is met.
