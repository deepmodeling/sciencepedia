This means the function $F$ must be symmetric in its arguments.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for $f$ to be a local isometry are that for all $(u,v)$ in the domain, $E(u,v) = G(v,u)$ and $F(u,v) = F(v,u)$.\nThese conditions exactly match option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1647737"}, {"introduction": "Proving that two surfaces are *not* locally isometric can be challenging, as it requires ruling out all possible distance-preserving maps.
