Such a transformation is called an isometry. Gauss's Theorema Egregium provides a powerful criterion to answer this question: an isometry between two surfaces can exist only if their Gaussian curvatures are identical at all corresponding points.\n\nLet $K_1(u, v)$ be the Gaussian curvature of the hyperbolic paraboloid $S_1$ at the point corresponding to the parameters $(u, v)$, and let $K_2$ be the Gaussian curvature of the sphere $S_2$.
