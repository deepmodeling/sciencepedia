The metric tensor is symmetric, so $g_{12} = g_{21}$.\n\nThe given line element is $ds^2 = 2f(x^1, x^2) dx^1 dx^2$. We can write this as $ds^2 = f(x^1, x^2) dx^1 dx^2 + f(x^1, x^2) dx^2 dx^1$. By comparing this with the general form, we can identify the components of the metric tensor:\n$g_{11} = 0$\n$g_{22} = 0$\n$g_{12} = g_{21} = f(x^1, x^2)$\n\nNext, we need to compute the Christoffel symbol of the first kind, $\\Gamma_{112}$.

Therefore, we must set our resulting expression to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^1} = 0 $$\n\nThis partial differential equation is the condition that the function $f$ must satisfy. The equation $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^1} = 0$ means that the function $f$ does not depend on the variable $x^1$. Therefore, $f$ can only be a function of the other coordinate, $x^2$.

However, it is not the most general condition, as any non-constant function of $x^2$ also works.\nB. $f(x^1, x^2)$ must be a function of only $x^1$. This means $f(x^1, x^2) = k(x^1)$. Then $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^1} = \\frac{dk}{dx^1}$, which is not generally zero. So this is incorrect.\nC. $f(x^1, x^2)$ must be a function of only $x^2$. This means $f(x^1, x^2)=h(x^2)$.

Then $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^1} = \\frac{dA}{dx^1}B(x^2)$. For this to be zero everywhere, we need either $B(x^2)=0$ (which contradicts $f$ being non-zero) or $\\frac{dA}{dx^1}=0$, which implies $A(x^1)$ is a constant. This reduces to case C, so it is not the most general form as stated.\nE. $f$ must satisfy $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^1} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^2}$.
