We can parameterize it as $u(t) = u_0$ and $v(t) = t$. The derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dt} = 1, \\quad \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} = 0 $$\nTo check if the geodesic equations hold, we first must verify if $t$ is an affine parameter. The speed of the curve is $|\\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \\sqrt{g_{ij}\\frac{du^i}{dt}\\frac{du^j}{dt}}$.\n$|\\mathbf{r}'(t)|^2 = g_{11}(\\frac{du}{dt})^2 + 2g_{12}\\frac{du}{dt}\\frac{dv}{dt} + g_{22}(\\frac{dv}{dt})^2 = (1+4u_0^2)(0)^2 + 0 + (u_0^2)(1)^2 = u_0^2$.\nThe speed is $|\\mathbf{r}'(t)| = u_0$, which is constant since $u_0$ is constant. Thus, the parameter $t$ is proportional to arc length, and it is an affine parameter. The geodesic equations with a zero right-hand side are applicable.\n\nStep 6: Substitute into the geodesic equations.\nWe must check both equations for $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n\nFor $k=1$ (the $u$-equation):\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^1_{11} \\left(\\frac{du}{dt}\\right)^2 + 2\\Gamma^1_{12} \\frac{du}{dt}\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\Gamma^1_{22} \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)^2 = 0 $$\nSubstituting the derivatives and Christoffel symbols (evaluated at $u=u_0$):\n$$ 0 + \\left(\\frac{4u_0}{1+4u_0^2}\\right)(0)^2 + 2(0)(0)(1) + \\left(-\\frac{u_0}{1+4u_0^2}\\right)(1)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ -\\frac{u_0}{1+4u_0^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation is only satisfied if $u_0 = 0$. However, the problem specifies that $u_0 > 0$. Therefore, for any non-zero $u_0$, this geodesic equation is not satisfied.\n\nFor $k=2$ (the $v$-equation):\n$$ \\frac{d^2 v}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^2_{11} \\left(\\frac{du}{dt}\\right)^2 + 2\\Gamma^2_{12} \\frac{du}{dt}\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\Gamma^2_{22} \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)^2 = 0 $$\nSubstituting the derivatives and Christoffel symbols:\n$$ 0 + (0)(0)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{u_0}\\right)(0)(1) + (0)(1)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ 0 = 0 $$\nThe second geodesic equation is satisfied for any choice of $u_0$.\n\nFor a curve to be a geodesic, *all* geodesic equations must be satisfied. Since the first equation ($k=1$) is not satisfied for any $u_0 > 0$, the curve is not a geodesic. The property of being a geodesic is intrinsic and does not depend on the parameterization (Option E is incorrect). The other options propose specific values for $u_0$, but our result shows it is not a geodesic for any non-zero $u_0$.\n\nConclusion: The horizontal circle on the paraboloid is never a geodesic for any non-zero radius.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2054928"}, {"introduction": "While the geodesic equations provide a universal tool, for certain surfaces a more elegant and intuitive approach exists.
