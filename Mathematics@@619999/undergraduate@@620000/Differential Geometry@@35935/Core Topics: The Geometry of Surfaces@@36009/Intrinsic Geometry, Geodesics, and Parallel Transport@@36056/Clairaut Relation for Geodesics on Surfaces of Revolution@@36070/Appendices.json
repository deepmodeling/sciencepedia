This quantity is described by Clairaut's relation.\n\nFirst, let's identify the surface and its properties. The surface is generated by revolving the curve $z=1/r$ about the $z$-axis. We can parameterize this surface using cylindrical-like coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the $z$-axis and $\\theta$ is the azimuthal angle.
