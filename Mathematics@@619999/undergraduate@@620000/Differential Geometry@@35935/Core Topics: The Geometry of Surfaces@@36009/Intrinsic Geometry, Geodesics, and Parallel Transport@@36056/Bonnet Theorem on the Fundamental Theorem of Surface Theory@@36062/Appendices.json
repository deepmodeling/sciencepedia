Since $E, F, G$ are all constants, all of their partial derivatives with respect to $u$ and $v$ are zero:\n$E_u = 0, E_v = 0$\n$F_u = 0, F_v = 0$\n$G_u = 0, G_v = 0$\nSubstituting these zero derivatives into the provided formulas for the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$, we find that every numerator is zero.

Therefore, the equation is not satisfied.\n\nStep 8: Draw the final conclusion.\nWe have found that the first Codazzi-Mainardi equation (CM1) is satisfied, but the second Codazzi-Mainardi equation (CM2) is not. This means the proposed fundamental forms are not compatible and cannot describe a real surface. The check of the compatibility equations is independent; failure of any one of them is sufficient to invalidate the forms.

The first fundamental form is $I = E du^2 + 2F du dv + G dv^2$. Comparing this with the given $I = du^2 + u^2 dv^2$, we have:\n$E = 1$, $F = 0$, $G = u^2$.\n\nThe second fundamental form is $II = L du^2 + 2M du dv + N dv^2$.

The matrix of the first fundamental form is $\\begin{pmatrix} E & F \\\\ F & G \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. For this matrix to be positive-definite, its leading principal minors must be positive. The first minor is $1 > 0$. The second minor is the determinant, $EG - F^2 = (1)(u^2) - 0^2 = u^2$. Since the domain is $u > 0$, we have $u^2 > 0$. Both minors are positive, so the form $I$ is positive-definite and represents a valid metric. Therefore, statement E is false.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B (Gauss Equation):**\nThe Gauss equation requires the intrinsic Gaussian curvature, determined solely by $I$, to be equal to the extrinsic Gaussian curvature, determined by both $I$ and $II$.\n\nThe extrinsic Gaussian curvature is given by $K = \\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2}$.\n$$K = \\frac{(1)(0) - 0^2}{u^2} = 0$$\n\nThe intrinsic Gaussian curvature can be calculated using the Brioschi formula. For an orthogonal parameterization where $F=0$, the formula is:\n$$K = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{EG}} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E}} \\frac{\\partial\\sqrt{G}}{\\partial u} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{G}} \\frac{\\partial\\sqrt{E}}{\\partial v} \\right) \\right]$$\nWe have $\\sqrt{E} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$ and $\\sqrt{G} = \\sqrt{u^2} = u$ (since $u > 0$).\nTheir derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial\\sqrt{E}}{\\partial v} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial\\sqrt{G}}{\\partial u} = 1$\nSubstituting these into the Brioschi formula:\n$$K = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u^2}} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left( \\frac{1}{1} \\cdot 1 \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} \\left( \\frac{1}{u} \\cdot 0 \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{u} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(1) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(0) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{u} [0 + 0] = 0$$\nSince both calculations yield $K=0$, the Gauss equation is satisfied. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\n**Evaluation of Options C and D (Codazzi-Mainardi Equations):**\nTo check the Codazzi-Mainardi equations, we first need the Christoffel symbols of the second kind ($\\Gamma^k_{ij}$).

This equation is only true if $u=0$, but the domain of the surface is specified as $u > 0$. Therefore, the second Codazzi-Mainardi equation is not satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Gauss equation and the first Codazzi-Mainardi equation are satisfied, but the second Codazzi-Mainardi equation is not.
