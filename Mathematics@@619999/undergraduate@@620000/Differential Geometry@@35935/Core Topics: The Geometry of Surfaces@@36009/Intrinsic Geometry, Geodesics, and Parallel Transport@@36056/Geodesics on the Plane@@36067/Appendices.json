In the familiar setting of the Euclidean plane, geodesics are precisely the straight lines. This exercise provides a concrete way to verify this by demonstrating that a path we know to be curved, a parabola, fails to satisfy the geodesic equation. By calculating the geodesic acceleration, you will see exactly why a parabola is not the shortest path between points in flat space [@problem_id:1641993].", "problem": "In differential geometry, a curve $\\gamma(t)$ on a manifold with a given metric is a geodesic if its acceleration vector is zero everywhere along the curve. For a two-dimensional plane with Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, x^2) = (x, y)$ and the standard Euclidean metric tensor $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ (where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta), the components of the acceleration vector $A(t)$ for a curve $\\gamma(t) = (x^1(t), x^2(t))$ are given by the geodesic equation:\n$$A^k(t) = \\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^2 \\Gamma_{ij}^k \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt}, \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2$$\nHere, $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind.\n\nConsider a particle moving along a parabolic path on this Euclidean plane.
