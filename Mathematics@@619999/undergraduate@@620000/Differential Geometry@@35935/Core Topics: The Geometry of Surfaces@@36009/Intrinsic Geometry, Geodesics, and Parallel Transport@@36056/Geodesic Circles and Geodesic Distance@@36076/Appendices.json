As the radius $\\rho$ of the geodesic circle increases, the circle may eventually cross over itself. Determine the smallest value of the dimensionless ratio $\\rho/R$ for which such a geodesic circle first self-intersects.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we can simplify the geometry by \"unrolling\" the cylinder into a plane. This is an isometric mapping, meaning that geodesic distances on the cylinder correspond to straight-line Euclidean distances in the unrolled plane.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system. The surface of the cylinder can be parameterized by $(\\theta, z)$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is the angle and $z \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$ is the height. In Cartesian coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$, this corresponds to $X = R \\cos\\theta$, $Y = R \\sin\\theta$, and $Z=z$. The unrolled plane can be described by coordinates $(x, y)$, where $x = R\\theta$ represents the circumferential distance and $y = z$ represents the height. The key property of this unrolling is that a point $(x,y)$ in the plane is identified with all points $(x + 2\\pi k R, y)$ for any integer $k$, as these correspond to wrapping around the cylinder $k$ times.\n\nLet's place the center of the geodesic circle, $p_0$, at the origin of our unrolled coordinate system, $(x, y) = (0, 0)$. On the cylinder, this corresponds to the point $(\\theta, z) = (0, 0)$, or $(R, 0, 0)$ in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nA geodesic circle of radius $\\rho$ centered at $p_0$ is the set of all points on the cylinder whose geodesic distance from $p_0$ is $\\rho$. In the unrolled plane, this corresponds to the set of points whose Euclidean distance from the origin is $\\rho$. This is simply a standard circle described by the equation:\n$$x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$$\nWe can parameterize this circle in the $(x, y)$ plane using an angle parameter $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$:\n$$x(\\phi) = \\rho \\cos\\phi$$\n$$y(\\phi) = \\rho \\sin\\phi$$\n\nNow, we map these points back onto the cylinder. The coordinates on the cylinder $(\\theta, z)$ are given by:\n$$\\theta(\\phi) = \\frac{x(\\phi)}{R} = \\frac{\\rho}{R} \\cos\\phi$$\n$$z(\\phi) = y(\\phi) = \\rho \\sin\\phi$$\nThe geodesic circle on the cylinder is the curve parameterized by $\\phi$.\n\nA self-intersection occurs if two different parameter values, say $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ (with $\\phi_1 \\neq \\phi_2$), map to the same physical point on the cylinder. For two points $(\\theta_1, z_1)$ and $(\\theta_2, z_2)$ to be the same point on the cylinder, they must have the same height and their angles must be equivalent. The conditions are:\n1.  $z_1 = z_2$\n2.  $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 + 2\\pi k$ for some non-zero integer $k$.\n\nLet's apply these conditions to our parameterized curve.\nFrom condition 1:\n$$z(\\phi_1) = z(\\phi_2) \\implies \\rho \\sin\\phi_1 = \\rho \\sin\\phi_2$$\nSince $\\rho > 0$, this simplifies to $\\sin\\phi_1 = \\sin\\phi_2$. For $\\phi_1, \\phi_2 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and $\\phi_1 \\neq \\phi_2$, this implies $\\phi_2 = \\pi - \\phi_1$. This relationship also gives us $\\cos\\phi_2 = \\cos(\\pi - \\phi_1) = -\\cos\\phi_1$. Note we must have $\\phi_1 \\neq \\pi/2$ for $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ to be distinct.\n\nNow, let's use condition 2. We look for the first intersection, which corresponds to the smallest number of \"wraps\", so we take $k=1$ (or $k=-1$, which leads to the same result).\n$$\\theta(\\phi_1) - \\theta(\\phi_2) = 2\\pi k$$\n$$\\frac{\\rho}{R} \\cos\\phi_1 - \\frac{\\rho}{R} \\cos\\phi_2 = 2\\pi k$$\nSubstitute $\\cos\\phi_2 = -\\cos\\phi_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\rho}{R} \\cos\\phi_1 - \\frac{\\rho}{R} (-\\cos\\phi_1) = 2\\pi k$$\n$$2\\frac{\\rho}{R} \\cos\\phi_1 = 2\\pi k$$\n$$\\cos\\phi_1 = \\frac{\\pi k R}{\\rho}$$\n\nWe are looking for the smallest ratio $\\rho/R$ that allows for a self-intersection. This means we are looking for the smallest $\\rho/R$ for which the equation above has a real solution for $\\phi_1$. Let's again choose $k=1$ for the simplest case of a single wrap-around.\n$$\\cos\\phi_1 = \\frac{\\pi R}{\\rho}$$\nFor a real solution for $\\phi_1$ to exist, the value of the cosine function must be in the range $[-1, 1]$. Since $\\rho$ and $R$ are positive, this means:\n$$0 < \\frac{\\pi R}{\\rho} \\le 1$$\nThis inequality must be satisfied for an intersection to occur. Rearranging for $\\rho$, we get:\n$$\\rho \\ge \\pi R$$\nThe self-intersection first becomes possible at the minimum value of $\\rho$ that satisfies this condition, which is $\\rho = \\pi R$.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest value of the ratio $\\rho/R$ for which self-intersection occurs. From the condition $\\rho \\ge \\pi R$, we can write:\n$$\\frac{\\rho}{R} \\ge \\pi$$\nThe smallest value for this ratio is therefore $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "1640214"}]}
