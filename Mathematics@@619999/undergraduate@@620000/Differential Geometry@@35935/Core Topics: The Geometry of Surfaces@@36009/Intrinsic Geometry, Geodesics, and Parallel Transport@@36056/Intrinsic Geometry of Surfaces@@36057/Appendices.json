A circular cylinder is a developable surface.\n\nFirst, we parameterize the cylinder. A standard parameterization for a cylinder of radius $R=1$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}(u, v) = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), v) $$\nHere, $u$ corresponds to the angle of rotation around the $z$-axis and $v$ corresponds to the height along the $z$-axis. The surface can be \"unrolled\" into a 2D plane with Cartesian coordinates $(u, v)$. A geodesic path on the cylinder corresponds to a straight line in this $(u, v)$-plane.\n\nThe equation of a straight line in the $(u,v)$-plane starting at $(u_0, v_0)$ with a constant velocity $(\\dot{u}_0, \\dot{v}_0)$ is given by:\n$$ u(t) = u_0 + \\dot{u}_0 t $$\n$$ v(t) = v_0 + \\dot{v}_0 t $$\nWe need to determine the initial conditions $u_0, v_0, \\dot{u}_0, \\dot{v}_0$ from the given information in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe initial position is $P_0 = (1, 0, 5)$.

The $z$-coordinate directly gives $v_0 = 5$. So, the initial position in the $(u,v)$-plane is $(u_0, v_0) = (0, 5)$.\n\nNext, we find the initial velocity in the $(u,v)$ coordinates.
