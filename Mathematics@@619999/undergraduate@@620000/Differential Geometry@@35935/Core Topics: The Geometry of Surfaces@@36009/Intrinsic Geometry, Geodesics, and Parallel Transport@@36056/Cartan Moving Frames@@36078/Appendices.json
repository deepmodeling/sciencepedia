The trajectory has a well-defined Frenet-Serret frame at every point, consisting of the orthonormal vectors: the tangent $\\mathbf{T}(t)$, the principal normal $\\mathbf{N}(t)$, and the binormal $\\mathbf{B}(t)$. It is observed that for a specific constant vector $\\mathbf{a} = \\langle 1, -2, 2 \\rangle$, both the tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and the principal normal vector $\\mathbf{N}(t)$ are orthogonal to $\\mathbf{a}$ for all values of the parameter $t$.

We are given that for all $t$, the tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and the principal normal vector $\\mathbf{N}(t)$ are orthogonal to the constant vector $\\mathbf{a} = \\langle 1, -2, 2 \\rangle$.\n\nMathematically, this orthogonality condition can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{a} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{a} = 0\n$$\n\nThe binormal vector $\\mathbf{B}(t)$ is defined as the cross product of the tangent and principal normal vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\mathbf{T}(t) \\times \\mathbf{N}(t)\n$$\n\nThe vector $\\mathbf{B}(t)$ is, by definition of the cross product, orthogonal to both $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{N}(t)$. The vectors $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{N}(t)$ are orthonormal and span the osculating plane. Since the constant vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is orthogonal to both $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{N}(t)$, it must be normal to the osculating plane. Therefore, the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ must be parallel to the binormal vector $\\mathbf{B}(t)$.\n\nWe can express this relationship as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = c(t) \\mathbf{a}\n$$\nfor some scalar function $c(t)$.\n\nBy definition, the binormal vector $\\mathbf{B}(t)$ is a unit vector, i.e., $\\|\\mathbf{B}(t)\\| = 1$. We can use this property to determine $c(t)$.\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{B}(t)\\| = \\|c(t) \\mathbf{a}\\| = |c(t)| \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = 1\n$$\n\nLet's calculate the magnitude of the vector $\\mathbf{a}$:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4 + 4} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the magnitude equation:\n$$\n|c(t)| \\cdot 3 = 1 \\implies |c(t)| = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis means that for each $t$, $c(t)$ is either $\\frac{1}{3}$ or $-\\frac{1}{3}$. Since the curve is smooth, the Frenet frame vectors vary continuously. Therefore, $c(t)$ must be a constant function, either $c(t) = 1/3$ for all $t$ or $c(t) = -1/3$ for all $t$.\n\nIn either case, the binormal vector $\\mathbf{B}(t)$ is a constant vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{const}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{3} \\langle 1, -2, 2 \\rangle\n$$\n\nNow we use the Frenet-Serret formulas, which describe the derivatives of the frame vectors with respect to the arc length parameter $s$. The formula for the derivative of the binormal vector is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{ds} = -\\tau(s) \\mathbf{N}(s)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau(s)$ is the torsion.\n\nTo relate this to the given parameter $t$, we use the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{dt} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{ds} \\frac{ds}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{ds}{dt} = v(t) = \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$ is the speed of the particle. The problem states the trajectory is regular, which implies $v(t) \\neq 0$.\n\nCombining these equations gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{dt} = -\\tau(t) v(t) \\mathbf{N}(t)\n$$\n\nSince we established that $\\mathbf{B}(t)$ is a constant vector, its derivative with respect to $t$ must be the zero vector:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n$$\n-\\tau(t) v(t) \\mathbf{N}(t) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nWe know that $v(t) \\neq 0$ because the curve is regular. We also know that $\\mathbf{N}(t)$ is a unit vector, so it is never the zero vector. The existence of a well-defined $\\mathbf{N}(t)$ is guaranteed by the given condition that the curvature $\\kappa(t)$ is non-zero. For the product of three terms to be the zero vector, and with two of the terms ($v(t)$ and $\\mathbf{N}(t)$) being non-zero, the third term, the scalar function $\\tau(t)$, must be identically zero.\n\nThus, the torsion of the curve is:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = 0\n$$\nfor all $t$. This result signifies that the particle's trajectory lies entirely within a plane. The constant binormal vector $\\mathbf{B}$ is the normal vector to this plane. The information about the specific form of the curvature $\\kappa(t)$ was not needed for the calculation but confirms that the principal normal $\\mathbf{N}(t)$ is well-defined.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1627713"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond curves in three-dimensional space, Cartan's method provides a powerful framework for studying the intrinsic geometry of surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds.
