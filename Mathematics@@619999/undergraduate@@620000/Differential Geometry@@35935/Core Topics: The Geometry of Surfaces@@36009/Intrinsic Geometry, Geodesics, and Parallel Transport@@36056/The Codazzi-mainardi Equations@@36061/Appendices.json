The coordinates are $u^1=u$ and $u^2=v$.\n\nThe first fundamental form is $I = g_{11} du^2 + 2g_{12} du dv + g_{22} dv^2$.\nComparing this with the given form $I = a^2 du^2 + b^2 dv^2$, we identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$g_{11} = a^2$, $g_{22} = b^2$, and $g_{12} = g_{21} = 0$.\n\nThe second fundamental form is $II = L_{11} du^2 + 2L_{12} du dv + L_{22} dv^2$.\nComparing this with the given form $II = c \\,du^2 + d \\,dv^2$, we identify the components of the second fundamental form tensor $L_{ij}$:\n$L_{11} = c$, $L_{22} = d$, and $L_{12} = L_{21} = 0$.\n\nThe Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations consist of one Gauss equation and two Codazzi-Mainardi equations.\n\nFirst, we analyze the Codazzi-Mainardi equations. They can be written in terms of the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ of the surface connection. The Christoffel symbols are defined by:\n$$ \\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial u^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{li}}{\\partial u^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial u^l} \\right) $$\nIn our case, the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ are all constants ($a^2$ and $b^2$). Therefore, all their partial derivatives with respect to $u$ and $v$ are zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial u^k} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i,j,k. $$\nThis immediately implies that all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$.\n\nThe Codazzi-Mainardi equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L_{11}}{\\partial v} - \\frac{\\partial L_{12}}{\\partial u} = L_{11}\\Gamma^2_{12} + L_{12}(\\Gamma^1_{11} - \\Gamma^2_{22}) - L_{22}\\Gamma^2_{11} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L_{12}}{\\partial v} - \\frac{\\partial L_{22}}{\\partial u} = L_{11}\\Gamma^1_{22} + L_{12}(\\Gamma^2_{12} - \\Gamma^1_{11}) - L_{22}\\Gamma^1_{12} $$\nSince all $L_{ij}$ are constants, their partial derivatives are zero. Also, all Christoffel symbols are zero. Substituting these values, the equations become:\n$0 - 0 = 0$\n$0 - 0 = 0$\nThus, the Codazzi-Mainardi equations are trivially satisfied for any choice of the constants $a, b, c, d$.\n\nNow, we must check the Gauss equation. The Gauss Theorema Egregium states that the Gaussian curvature $K$ is an intrinsic property of the surface, determined solely by the first fundamental form. The general formula for $K$ in terms of the metric components $E=g_{11}, F=g_{12}, G=g_{22}$ is complex, but it simplifies greatly when the metric components are constant. Since all $g_{ij}$ are constant, all their derivatives are zero, which leads to a Gaussian curvature of $K=0$. This can be seen from the formula for the Riemann curvature tensor, $R^k_{lij} = \\partial_i \\Gamma^k_{lj} - \\partial_j \\Gamma^k_{li} + \\Gamma^m_{lj}\\Gamma^k_{mi} - \\Gamma^m_{li}\\Gamma^k_{mj}$, which is zero since all Christoffel symbols and their derivatives are zero. As $K$ is related to the Riemann tensor, $K=0$. A surface with $K=0$ is called a flat surface (e.g., a plane, cylinder, or cone).\n\nHowever, the Gaussian curvature can also be expressed in terms of both fundamental forms as the determinant of the shape operator (or Weingarten map), which is given by:\n$$ K = \\frac{\\det(L_{ij})}{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\frac{L_{11}L_{22} - L_{12}^2}{g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}^2} $$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$ \\det(g_{ij}) = (a^2)(b^2) - 0^2 = a^2b^2 $$\n$$ \\det(L_{ij}) = (c)(d) - 0^2 = cd $$\nSo, the Gaussian curvature is:\n$$ K = \\frac{cd}{a^2b^2} $$\nFor the surface to exist, the two expressions for the Gaussian curvature must be consistent. Therefore, we must equate them:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{cd}{a^2b^2} $$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are given as non-zero constants, their product $a^2b^2$ is non-zero. The equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ cd = 0 $$\nThis implies that either $c=0$ or $d=0$ (or both). However, the problem statement explicitly requires that $a, b, c, d$ are all non-zero real constants. This leads to a contradiction: the condition $cd=0$ derived from the compatibility requirement violates the given premise that $c \\neq 0$ and $d \\neq 0$.\n\nBecause the Gauss equation leads to a contradiction with the problem's conditions, no such surface can be realized in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The given first and second fundamental forms are inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, no such surface can exist under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1669367"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall when first learning the Codazzi-Mainardi equations is to overlook the terms involving the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, especially when the second fundamental form has constant coefficients.
