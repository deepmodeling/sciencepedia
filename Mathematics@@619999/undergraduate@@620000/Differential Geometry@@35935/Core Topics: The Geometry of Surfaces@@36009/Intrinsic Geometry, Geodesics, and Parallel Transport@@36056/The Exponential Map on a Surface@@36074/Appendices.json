The rover is located at the origin $p=(0,0)$ of the $(x,y)$ coordinate system. To survey the area, the rover dispatches a series of probes. Each probe is launched with an initial velocity vector $v=(u, C)$ belonging to the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^2$, where $C$ is a fixed positive real constant representing a vertical velocity component, and $u$ is a variable real number representing a horizontal velocity component.\n\nThe probes travel along geodesics of the terrain for a parameter time of $t=1$.
