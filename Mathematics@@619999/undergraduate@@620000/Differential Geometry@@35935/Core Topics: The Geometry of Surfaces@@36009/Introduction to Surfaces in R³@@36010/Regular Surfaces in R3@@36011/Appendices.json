Two standard criteria we will use are:\n1) If $S$ is a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to \\mathbb{R}$, then $X(u,v)=(u,v,f(u,v))$ has $X_{u}=(1,0,f_{u})$ and $X_{v}=(0,1,f_{v})$, which are linearly independent everywhere (their cross product never vanishes), so $S$ is a regular surface.\n2) If $S=F^{-1}(0)$ for a smooth $F:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\nabla F\\neq 0$ at all points of $S$, then by the implicit function theorem $S$ is a regular surface. If $\\nabla F=0$ at some $p\\in S$, the theorem does not apply and $p$ may be a singularity; if $S$ fails to be locally homeomorphic to an open set of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ at any point, then $S$ is not a regular surface.\n\nA. $S_{A}=\\{(x,y,z)\\mid z=x^{3}-3xy^{2}\\}$. This is the graph of the smooth function $f(x,y)=x^{3}-3xy^{2}$. Take the parametrization $X(u,v)=(u,v,u^{3}-3uv^{2})$.

Hence $S_{A}$ is a regular surface.\n\nB. $S_{B}=\\{(x,y,z)\\mid (x^{2}+y^{2}-1)^{2}+z^{2}=0\\}$. Since a sum of squares is zero if and only if each term is zero, this implies\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}-1=0,\\quad z=0,\n$$\nso $S_{B}$ is the unit circle in the plane $z=0$.

This is equivalent to $x=0$ or $y=0$ or $z=0$, i.e., the union of the three coordinate planes. At points along the lines where two planes intersect (e.g., the $z$-axis with $x=y=0$) and at the origin where all three meet, any neighborhood in $S_{C}$ is a union of multiple sheets meeting along a line or at a point, which is not locally homeomorphic to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
