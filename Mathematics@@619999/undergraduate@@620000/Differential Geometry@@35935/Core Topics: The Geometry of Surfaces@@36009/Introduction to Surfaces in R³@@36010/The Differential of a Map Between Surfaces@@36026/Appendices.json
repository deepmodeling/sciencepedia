The map is an orientation-preserving isometry.\n\nB. The map is an orientation-reversing isometry.\n\nC. The map is not an isometry because it does not preserve Gaussian curvature.\n\nD. The map is not an isometry because it does not preserve mean curvature.", "solution": "We first verify that $F$ maps $S$ to itself. Let $(x,y,z)$ lie on $S$, so $z=x^{2}-y^{2}$. The image point is $(x',y',z') = F(x,y,z)=(y,x,-z)$. To check if this point is on $S$, we must verify if $z' = x'^2 - y'^2$. We have $x'^2 - y'^2 = y^2 - x^2 = -(x^2-y^2) = -z$.

Since the induced metric on $S$ is the restriction of the Euclidean metric, the first fundamental form is preserved by $F|_{S}$; hence $F|_{S}$ is an isometry of $S$.\n\nNext, we determine whether $F|_{S}$ preserves or reverses the orientation of $S$. Parametrize $S$ by $r(u,v)=(u,v,u^{2}-v^{2})$. Then $r_u=(1,0,2u)$ and $r_v=(0,1,-2v)$. The map on the surface corresponds to swapping the parameters, since $F(r(u,v)) = (v,u, v^2-u^2) = r(v,u)$. Let's see how the differential $dF$ (represented by matrix $A$) transforms the tangent basis $(r_u, r_v)$ at a point $p=r(u,v)$:\n$$ dF_p(r_u) = A \\cdot r_u = (0,1,-2u) = r_v(v,u) $$\n$$ dF_p(r_v) = A \\cdot r_v = (1,0,2v) = r_u(v,u) $$\nThe differential maps the ordered basis $(r_u, r_v)$ at $p$ to the basis $(r_v, r_u)$ at $F(p)$. Since the order of the basis vectors is swapped, the map reverses the orientation of the tangent space. Therefore, $F|_S$ is an orientation-reversing isometry.\n\nConsequences for the alternatives:\n- Since $F|_{S}$ preserves the first fundamental form, it is an isometry, so options C and D are false. In particular, Gaussian curvature is preserved by any isometry by Theorema Egregium, contradicting C. Mean curvature may change sign under an orientation-reversing isometry, but that does not negate the map being an isometry, so D is also false.\n- As shown, $F|_{S}$ reverses the surface orientation, so A is false and B is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that $F|_{S}$ is an orientation-reversing isometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1671206"}]}
