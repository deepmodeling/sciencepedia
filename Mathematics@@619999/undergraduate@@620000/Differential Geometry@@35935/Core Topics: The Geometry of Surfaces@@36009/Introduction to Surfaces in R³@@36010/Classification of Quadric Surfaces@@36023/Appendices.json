The standard equation of an ellipse centered at the origin is $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a$ and $b$ are the semi-axes lengths. For our equation $A x^2 + B y^2 = 1$ to represent an ellipse, the coefficients $A$ and $B$ must both be positive. Let $A = 1/a^2$ and $B = 1/b^2$. If either $A$ or $B$ were negative, the curve would be a hyperbola. If both were negative, there would be no real solution.
