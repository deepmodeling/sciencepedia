[@problem_id:2160195]", "problem": "A mechanical component for a high-precision optical assembly has an internal surface with a specific profile. This surface is a surface of revolution. The generating curve, which lies entirely within the yz-plane, is a segment of a parabola. This parabola is defined by the following properties: its axis of symmetry is parallel to the z-axis, its vertex is located at the point $(y, z) = (R_0, 0)$ where $R_0 > 0$, and it passes through the point $(y, z) = (0, H)$ where $H > 0$. The surface is formed by revolving this parabolic curve around the z-axis. The equation of the resulting surface can be expressed in the form $z = F(x, y, R_0, H)$. Determine the expression for $F(x, y, R_0, H)$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to first find the equation of the generating parabola in the yz-plane and then use it to find the equation of the surface of revolution.\n\nFirst, let's determine the equation of the parabola in the yz-plane. The problem states that the parabola has its axis of symmetry parallel to the z-axis. The standard form for such a parabola with a vertex at $(y_v, z_v)$ is $z - z_v = a(y - y_v)^2$, where $a$ is a constant that determines the parabola's width and opening direction.\n\nWe are given that the vertex of the parabola is at $(y, z) = (R_0, 0)$. Substituting these coordinates for $(y_v, z_v)$, the equation becomes:\n$$z - 0 = a(y - R_0)^2$$\n$$z = a(y - R_0)^2$$\n\nTo find the constant $a$, we use the second piece of information: the parabola passes through the point $(y, z) = (0, H)$. We substitute these values into the equation:\n$$H = a(0 - R_0)^2$$\n$$H = a R_0^2$$\n\nSolving for $a$, we get:\n$$a = \\frac{H}{R_0^2}$$\nSince $H > 0$ and $R_0 > 0$, the constant $a$ is positive, which confirms that the parabola opens in the positive z-direction, consistent with its vertex being at $z=0$ and passing through a point with $z=H>0$.\n\nNow we can write the complete equation for the generating parabola in the yz-plane:\n$$z = \\frac{H}{R_0^2}(y - R_0)^2$$\n\nNext, we need to find the equation of the surface generated by revolving this parabola around the z-axis. A point $(x, y, z)$ lies on this surface if and only if it is on a circle centered on the z-axis, lying in a plane parallel to the xy-plane, and this circle passes through a point on the original generating curve.\n\nLet $(0, y_p, z_p)$ be a point on our generating parabola. The coordinates of this point satisfy the parabolic equation: $z_p = \\frac{H}{R_0^2}(y_p - R_0)^2$.\nWhen this point is revolved around the z-axis, it traces a circle at a constant height $z = z_p$. The radius of this circle is the distance of the point $(0, y_p, z_p)$ from the z-axis, which is $|y_p|$.\n\nFor any point $(x, y, z)$ on the surface of revolution, its height is $z$ and its distance from the z-axis is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. To be on the surface, this point must correspond to a point on the generating curve. This means:\n1. The height must be the same: $z = z_p$.\n2. The distance from the axis of revolution must be the same: $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = |y_p|$.\n\nSince the parabola's vertex is at $y=R_0$ and it passes through $y=0$, the curve segment being revolved could span positive and negative y values. However, revolving the $y0$ part gives the same surface as revolving the $y>0$ part. Let's consider the generating point $(0, y_p, z_p)$ to have $y_p \\ge 0$. Then $|y_p| = y_p$, and we have the relation $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = y_p$.\n\nWe can now substitute $z_p = z$ and $y_p = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ into the equation of the parabola:\n$$z = \\frac{H}{R_0^2} \\left( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R_0 \\right)^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expression $F(x, y, R_0, H)$ such that $z = F(x, y, R_0, H)$. Based on our derivation, this expression is:\n$$F(x, y, R_0, H) = \\frac{H}{R_0^2} \\left( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R_0 \\right)^2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{H}{R_0^2} \\left( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R_0 \\right)^2}$$", "id": "2160195"}, {"introduction": "Once we have an equation for a surface, the next step is to explore its metric properties, such as measuring distances along its curves.
