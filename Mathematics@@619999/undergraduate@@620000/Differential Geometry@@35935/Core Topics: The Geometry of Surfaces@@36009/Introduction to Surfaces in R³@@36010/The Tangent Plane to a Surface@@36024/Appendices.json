The solution involves three main steps: first, finding the equation of the tangent plane; second, determining the intercepts of this plane with the coordinate axes; and third, calculating the volume of the tetrahedron using these intercepts.\n\nStep 1: Find the equation of the tangent plane.\nThe surface is given by the graph of the function $f(x, y) = \\ln(x^2 + y)$. The general equation for a plane tangent to the surface $z=f(x,y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is given by:\n$$z - z_0 = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0) (x - x_0) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0) (y - y_0)$$\nThe point of tangency is given as $P = (1, 0, 0)$, so we have $(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (1, 0, 0)$.\n\nFirst, we need to compute the partial derivatives of $f(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\ln(x^2 + y) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 + y}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\ln(x^2 + y) = \\frac{1}{x^2 + y}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $(x_0, y_0) = (1, 0)$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(1, 0) = \\frac{2(1)}{1^2 + 0} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(1, 0) = \\frac{1}{1^2 + 0} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$$\n\nNow we substitute these values into the tangent plane equation:\n$$z - 0 = 2(x - 1) + 1(y - 0)$$\n$$z = 2x - 2 + y$$\nRearranging this into the standard form $Ax + By + Cz = D$, we get:\n$$2x + y - z = 2$$\n\nStep 2: Find the intercepts of the tangent plane with the coordinate axes.\nThe equation of the tangent plane is $2x + y - z = 2$. The vertices of the tetrahedron (other than the origin) are the points where this plane intersects the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.\n\nTo find the x-intercept, we set $y=0$ and $z=0$:\n$$2x + 0 - 0 = 2 \\implies 2x = 2 \\implies x = 1$$\nThe x-intercept is at the point $(1, 0, 0)$.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we set $x=0$ and $z=0$:\n$$2(0) + y - 0 = 2 \\implies y = 2$$\nThe y-intercept is at the point $(0, 2, 0)$.\n\nTo find the z-intercept, we set $x=0$ and $y=0$:\n$$2(0) + 0 - z = 2 \\implies -z = 2 \\implies z = -2$$\nThe z-intercept is at the point $(0, 0, -2)$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of the tetrahedron.\nThe tetrahedron is formed by the origin $(0,0,0)$ and the three intercept points: $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 2, 0)$, and $(0, 0, -2)$. The volume $V$ of a tetrahedron with vertices at the origin and at $(x_i, 0, 0)$, $(0, y_i, 0)$, and $(0, 0, z_i)$ on the axes is given by the formula:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{6} |x_i y_i z_i|$$\nSubstituting the intercept values we found: $x_i = 1$, $y_i = 2$, and $z_i = -2$.\n$$V = \\frac{1}{6} |(1)(2)(-2)| = \\frac{1}{6} |-4| = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThus, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{2}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "1666150"}, {"introduction": "Many surfaces in science and engineering are not given as simple functions but as level sets where a certain quantity remains constant.
