An engineer wishes to place a tiny Light Emitting Diode (LED) at a specific point $P$ on this surface.

Let the function be $F(x, y, z) = xy - z$. The surface is then the level set $F(x, y, z) = 0$.\n\nThe normal vector to a level surface $F(x, y, z) = c$ at any point $(x, y, z)$ is given by the gradient of the function $F$, which is denoted by $\\nabla F$. We calculate the gradient of our function $F$:\n$$\n\\nabla F(x, y, z) = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = -1\n$$\nSo, the normal vector at any point $(x, y, z)$ on the surface is $\\vec{n} = \\nabla F = \\langle y, x, -1 \\rangle$.\n\nNext, we identify the direction vector of the given line. The line is described by the vector equation $\\vec{r}(t) = \\langle 2t + 1, 3t + 1, 1 - t \\rangle$. This can be rewritten in the standard form $\\vec{r}(t) = \\vec{r}_0 + t\\vec{v}$, where $\\vec{r}_0$ is a position vector of a point on the line and $\\vec{v}$ is the direction vector.\n$$\n\\vec{r}(t) = \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle + t \\langle 2, 3, -1 \\rangle\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the direction vector of the line as $\\vec{v} = \\langle 2, 3, -1 \\rangle$.\n\nThe problem states that the normal vector $\\vec{n}$ at point $P$ is parallel to the direction vector $\\vec{v}$. This means that $\\vec{n}$ must be a scalar multiple of $\\vec{v}$. Let this scalar be $k$.\n$$\n\\vec{n} = k\\vec{v}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle y, x, -1 \\rangle = k \\langle 2, 3, -1 \\rangle\n$$\nThis vector equation gives us a system of three linear equations by equating the corresponding components:\n1.  $y = 2k$\n2.  $x = 3k$\n3.  $-1 = -k$\n\nFrom the third equation, we can directly solve for $k$:\n$$\n-1 = -k \\implies k = 1\n$$\nNow we can substitute the value of $k$ back into the first two equations to find the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point $P$:\nFor the $y$-coordinate:\n$$\ny = 2(1) = 2\n$$\nFor the $x$-coordinate:\n$$\nx = 3(1) = 3\n$$\nSo we have found that the point $P$ has $x=3$ and $y=2$. Since the point $P$ must lie on the surface $z = xy$, we can find its $z$-coordinate by substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ into the surface equation:\n$$\nz = (3)(2) = 6\n$$\nTherefore, the coordinates of the point $P$ are $(3, 2, 6)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1666142"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the previous exercise, this practice challenges you to solve a more intricate geometric problem.
