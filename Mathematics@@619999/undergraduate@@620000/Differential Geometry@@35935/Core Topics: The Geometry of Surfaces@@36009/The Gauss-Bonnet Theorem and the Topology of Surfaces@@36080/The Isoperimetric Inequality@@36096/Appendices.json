Equality is achieved if and only if the curve is a circle. The quantity $\\Delta = L^2 - 4\\pi A$ is known as the isoperimetric deficit, which serves as a measure of how much a shape deviates from being perfectly circular.\n\nConsider an equilateral triangle with a side length of $s$. Your task is to compute the isoperimetric deficit for this triangle.

We are tasked with computing the isoperimetric deficit, which is defined as $\\Delta = L^2 - 4\\pi A$, where $L$ is the perimeter and $A$ is the area of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we determine the perimeter $L$. An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length. Therefore, the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of these three sides.\n$$L = s + s + s = 3s$$\n\nNext, we determine the area $A$ of the equilateral triangle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Let's consider one side of the triangle as its base, so the base has length $s$. The height, $h$, is the length of the perpendicular line segment from the opposite vertex to this base. This altitude bisects the base, creating two congruent right-angled triangles. Each of these right triangles has a hypotenuse of length $s$ and a base of length $s/2$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on one of these right triangles, we can find the height $h$:\n$$h^2 + \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 = s^2$$\n$$h^2 = s^2 - \\frac{s^2}{4} = \\frac{4s^2 - s^2}{4} = \\frac{3s^2}{4}$$\nTaking the principal square root, we get the height:\n$$h = \\sqrt{\\frac{3s^2}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$$\nNow, we can calculate the area $A$ of the equilateral triangle:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times s \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$$\n\nWith the expressions for both the perimeter $L$ and the area $A$, we can substitute them into the formula for the isoperimetric deficit $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = L^2 - 4\\pi A$$\n$$\\Delta = (3s)^2 - 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2\\right)$$\nSimplifying the terms, we get:\n$$\\Delta = 9s^2 - \\pi\\sqrt{3}s^2$$\nFinally, we can factor out the common term $s^2$ to obtain the final expression for the isoperimetric deficit of an equilateral triangle:\n$$\\Delta = (9 - \\pi\\sqrt{3})s^2$$\nSince $\\pi \\approx 3.14$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73$, $\\pi\\sqrt{3} \\approx 5.44$, which is less than 9.
