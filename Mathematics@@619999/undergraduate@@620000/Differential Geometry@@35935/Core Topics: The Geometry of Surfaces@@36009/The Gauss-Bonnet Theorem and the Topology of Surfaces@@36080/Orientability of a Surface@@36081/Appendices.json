A distinct concept is orientability, which is a global topological property related to the consistency of \"sidedness\" across the entire surface. This problem explores the relationship between these two fundamental concepts.\n\nConsider two surfaces, $S_1$ and $S_2$, both constructed from an infinite number of copies of a flat rectangular sheet $R_0 = \\{ (u, v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 0 \\le u \\le L, -w \\le v \\le w \\}$, where $L$ and $w$ are positive constants. The local geometry on both surfaces is inherited from the flat Euclidean plane, meaning in local coordinates $(u,v)$, the first fundamental form for both surfaces is given by $I = du^2 + dv^2$.\n\nThe surfaces are distinguished by their global construction, specifically by the rules used to glue the vertical edges of the rectangles:\n- **Surface $S_1$**: This surface is formed by identifying the edge $u=0$ with the edge $u=L$ using the rule $(0, v) \\sim (L, v)$ for all $v \\in [-w, w]$.

Both $S_1$ and $S_2$ are orientable, but this result does not provide enough information to draw a general conclusion about the first fundamental form and orientability.", "solution": "We use the definition: a surface is orientable if there exists an atlas whose transition maps all have Jacobian determinants that are positive; if any transition map has negative determinant on an overlap, the surface is non-orientable.\n\nBoth $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are obtained from the same flat rectangle $R_{0}$ with local coordinates $(u,v)$ and first fundamental form $I=du^{2}+dv^{2}$. Within any chart contained strictly inside $R_{0}$, transition maps are restrictions of Euclidean isometries of the plane that preserve orientation (such as translations and the identity), so their Jacobian determinants are $+1$. The only potentially nontrivial transition comes from charts that cross the vertical edges and therefore must use the gluing rule.\n\nFor $S_{1}$ (cylinder), the identification is $(0,v)\\sim(L,v)$.

All other overlaps are compositions with translations or identities and likewise have positive Jacobian determinants. Therefore $S_{1}$ admits an atlas with all transition determinants positive, so $S_{1}$ is orientable.\n\nFor $S_{2}$ (Möbius strip), the identification is $(0,v)\\sim(L,-v)$.

Equivalently, transporting an oriented basis once around the band maps $(\\partial_{u},\\partial_{v})$ to $(\\partial_{u},-\\partial_{v})$, reversing orientation.\n\nIn both constructions, the first fundamental form is the same locally, namely $I=du^{2}+dv^{2}$, yet the orientability differs: $S_{1}$ is orientable and $S_{2}$ is not. Therefore the first fundamental form alone (a local Riemannian metric) does not determine orientability, which is a global topological property.
