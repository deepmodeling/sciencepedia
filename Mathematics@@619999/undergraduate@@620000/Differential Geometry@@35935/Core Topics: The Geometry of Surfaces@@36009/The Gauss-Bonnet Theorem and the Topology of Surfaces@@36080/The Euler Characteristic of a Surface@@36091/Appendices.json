The structure of this material can be modeled as a polyhedral complex, or tiling, on this surface. This tiling is composed exclusively of $N_5$ pentagonal faces and $N_7$ heptagonal faces. A crucial structural constraint, imposed by the way the constituent molecules bond, is that exactly three faces meet at every vertex of the tiling.\n\nBased on this information, derive a general formula for the Euler characteristic, $\\chi$, of the surface on which the material is formed. Your formula should be expressed in terms of $N_5$ and $N_7$.", "solution": "The Euler characteristic, $\\chi$, of a polyhedral complex on a surface is given by the Euler-Poincar√© formula:\n$$ \\chi = V - E + F $$\nwhere $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces of the tiling. We need to express $V$, $E$, and $F$ in terms of the given parameters, $N_5$ (number of pentagons) and $N_7$ (number of heptagons).\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of faces, $F$. Since the tiling is composed exclusively of pentagons and heptagons, the total number of faces is simply the sum of the number of each type of polygon:\n$$ F = N_5 + N_7 $$\n\nNext, we determine the total number of edges, $E$. We can count the edges by summing the number of edges for all faces and then dividing by two, since each edge is shared by exactly two adjacent faces. A pentagon has 5 edges and a heptagon has 7 edges. Therefore, summing the edges over all faces gives $5N_5 + 7N_7$. This sum counts each edge twice, so we have:\n$$ 2E = 5N_5 + 7N_7 $$\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2}(5N_5 + 7N_7) $$\n\nFinally, we determine the total number of vertices, $V$. The problem states that exactly three faces meet at each vertex. In such a polyhedral complex, this implies that exactly three edges also meet at each vertex. This means every vertex has a degree of 3. We can relate the number of vertices and edges using a double-counting argument (also known as the handshaking lemma). The sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. Since every one of the $V$ vertices has a degree of 3, the sum of the degrees is $3V$. Thus:\n$$ 3V = 2E $$\nThis gives us a relationship between $V$ and $E$:\n$$ V = \\frac{2}{3}E $$\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for $V$, $E$, and $F$ into the Euler characteristic formula:\n$$ \\chi = V - E + F $$\nSubstituting $V = \\frac{2}{3}E$, we get:\n$$ \\chi = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}E\\right) - E + F = -\\frac{1}{3}E + F $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $E$ and $F$ in terms of $N_5$ and $N_7$ into this simplified equation for $\\chi$:\n$$ \\chi = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(5N_5 + 7N_7) \\right) + (N_5 + N_7) $$\n$$ \\chi = -\\frac{5N_5 + 7N_7}{6} + (N_5 + N_7) $$\n\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{-(5N_5 + 7N_7) + 6(N_5 + N_7)}{6} $$\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{-5N_5 - 7N_7 + 6N_5 + 6N_7}{6} $$\n\nGrouping the terms with $N_5$ and $N_7$:\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{(6N_5 - 5N_5) + (6N_7 - 7N_7)}{6} $$\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{N_5 - N_7}{6} $$\n\nThis is the final formula for the Euler characteristic of the surface in terms of the number of pentagonal and heptagonal faces.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{N_{5} - N_{7}}{6}}$$", "id": "1672834"}, {"introduction": "The Euler characteristic can also be understood by how it behaves under topological modifications, a concept we can think of as \"topological surgery.\" This practice [@problem_id:1672808] investigates the effect of removing disks from a sphere, a fundamental operation that creates boundary components.
