A surgical procedure is performed on this torus. First, the torus is cut along a simple closed curve $C$.

This cutting process creates two new circular boundary components on the resulting surface. In the second step of the procedure, two separate disks are used to \"cap\" the surface by identifying the boundary of each disk with one of the newly created boundary components via a homeomorphism.
