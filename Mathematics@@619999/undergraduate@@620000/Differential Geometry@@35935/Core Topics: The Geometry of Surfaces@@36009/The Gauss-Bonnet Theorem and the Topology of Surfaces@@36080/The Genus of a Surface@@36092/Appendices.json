The surface of this module is known to be a closed, orientable manifold. The design consists of a network layout with specific features: there are exactly 20 connection nodes, which are treated as vertices. These nodes are linked by 30 distinct, non-intersecting data pathways, which are treated as edges. This network of nodes and pathways divides the entire surface of the module into 6 separate, contiguous regions, which are treated as faces. Based on this topological configuration, calculate the genus of the module's surface.", "solution": "The problem asks for the genus of a closed, orientable surface based on the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a graph embedded on it.\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting these quantities is the Euler-Poincaré formula for a polyhedral complex on a surface $S$. The formula states that the Euler characteristic, $\\chi(S)$, of the surface is given by:\n$$\n\\chi(S) = V - E + F\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces of the cellular decomposition of the surface.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n- The number of vertices, $V = 20$.\n- The number of edges, $E = 30$.\n- The number of faces, $F = 6$.\n\nWe can substitute these values into the Euler-Poincaré formula to calculate the Euler characteristic of the module's surface:\n$$\n\\chi(S) = 20 - 30 + 6\n$$\n$$\n\\chi(S) = -10 + 6\n$$\n$$\n\\chi(S) = -4\n$$\nNow, for any closed, orientable surface, the Euler characteristic is related to its genus, $g$, by the following formula:\n$$\n\\chi(S) = 2 - 2g\n$$\nThe genus $g$ is an integer representing the number of \"handles\" on the surface (e.g., a sphere has $g=0$, a torus has $g=1$, a double-torus has $g=2$, and so on).\n\nWe have already calculated the Euler characteristic to be $-4$.
