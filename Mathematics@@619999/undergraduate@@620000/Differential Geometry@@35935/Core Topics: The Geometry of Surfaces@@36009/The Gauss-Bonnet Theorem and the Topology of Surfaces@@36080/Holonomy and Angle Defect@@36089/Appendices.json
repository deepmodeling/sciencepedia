We begin with a very familiar object—a regular cube—to build concrete intuition. This exercise [@problem_id:1644491] will help you see how curvature, which we often associate with smooth, curved surfaces, is concentrated at the vertices of objects made from flat faces.", "problem": "In the study of discrete geometry, the curvature of a surface can be characterized at the vertices of a polyhedron. This is quantified by the angle defect. The angle defect at a vertex is defined as the difference between the angle of a full circle ($2\\pi$ radians) and the sum of the interior angles of all the polygonal faces that meet at that vertex. Specifically, the angle defect $\\delta$ at a vertex is given by the formula:\n$$ \\delta = 2\\pi - \\sum_{i} \\alpha_i $$\nwhere the sum is taken over all faces meeting at the vertex, and $\\alpha_i$ is the interior angle of the $i$-th face at that vertex.\n\nConsider a regular cube, which is a polyhedron composed of six identical square faces.

By analyzing a cone, we will demonstrate that the angle defect at its apex is precisely the holonomy, which is the total rotation a vector accumulates when parallel-transported in a loop around that point. This practice [@problem_id:1644497] provides a crucial bridge, illustrating that angle defect is a direct measure of concentrated Gaussian curvature.", "problem": "Imagine a flat, flexible circular disk of negligible thickness. A sector is cut from this disk, corresponding to an angle $\\alpha$, where $0 < \\alpha < 2\\pi$. The resulting piece, which is a sector of a circle with angle $\\alpha$, has its two straight radial edges glued together seamlessly. This process forms a perfect cone, with the vertex of the sector becoming the apex of the cone.\n\nNow, consider a vector that lies in the tangent space of the cone's surface. This vector is initially located at a point on one of the cone's generators (the line formed by gluing the edges) and is oriented to point directly away from the apex along this generator. The vector is then parallel-transported along a small closed circular path that encircles the apex and returns to its starting point.\n\nUpon returning to its starting point, the vector will have rotated with respect to its initial orientation. Determine the total angle of this rotation. Express your final answer as an analytic expression in terms of $\\alpha$, in units of radians.", "solution": "Let the cone be formed by gluing the two radial edges of a planar sector of angle $\\alpha$. The surface is flat everywhere except at the apex, and the total angle around the apex on the cone equals $\\alpha$; the missing angle (deficit) is $2\\pi - \\alpha$.\n\nConsider a small loop on the cone at fixed slant distance $\\rho$ from the apex. Cut the cone along the generator (the glued seam) and develop it isometrically into the plane. Under this development, the loop becomes an arc of a circle centered at the sector’s vertex, spanning angle $\\alpha$, and the starting and ending points lie on the two boundary rays of the sector.\n\nParallel transport with respect to the Levi-Civita connection is preserved under isometries. In the plane, parallel transport along any curve preserves a vector’s direction relative to a fixed Cartesian frame. Therefore, after traversing the arc of angle $\\alpha$ in the plane, the transported vector at the endpoint equals the initial vector when compared in the planar frame:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\text{end, plane}} = \\vec{v}_{\\text{start, plane}}.\n$$\nTo reconstruct the cone, the two boundary rays of the sector are identified by a rotation about the vertex through the deficit angle $2\\pi - \\alpha$. Denote this identification by the rotation $G$ with angle $2\\pi - \\alpha$. The vector on the cone upon returning to the starting point is the image under $G$ of the planar endpoint vector:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\text{end, cone}} = G\\big(\\vec{v}_{\\text{end, plane}}\\big) = G\\big(\\vec{v}_{\\text{start, plane}}\\big).\n$$\nThus the net rotation of the vector with respect to its initial orientation after one loop is exactly the rotation angle of $G$, which is the deficit angle:\n$$\n\\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi - \\alpha.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, by the holonomy-curvature relation for parallel transport on surfaces, the rotation angle equals the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the enclosed region. Since the cone is flat off the apex and the apex carries total curvature equal to the deficit angle, one has\n$$\n\\Delta\\theta = \\int\\!\\!\\int K\\,dA = 2\\pi - \\alpha.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the total rotation angle acquired by the vector after one circuit around the apex is $2\\pi - \\alpha$ radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi - \\alpha}$$", "id": "1644497"}, {"introduction": "Our final exercise showcases one of the most profound ideas in geometry: the relationship between local properties and global topology.
