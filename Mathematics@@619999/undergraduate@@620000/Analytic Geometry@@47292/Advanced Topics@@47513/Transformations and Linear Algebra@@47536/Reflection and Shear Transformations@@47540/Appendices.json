We will apply the transformations sequentially.\n\nStep 1: Reflection across the y-axis.\nA reflection across the y-axis transforms a point $(x, y)$ to a new point $(-x, y)$. This operation changes the sign of the x-component while leaving the y-component unchanged. Let the position vector after this first transformation be $\\vec{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ y_1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nApplying the reflection to $\\vec{v}_0$:\n$$x_1 = -x_0 = -2$$\n$$y_1 = y_0 = 3$$\nSo, the vector after reflection is $\\vec{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nStep 2: Horizontal shear.\nThe problem defines a horizontal shear with factor $k$ as the transformation that maps a point $(x, y)$ to $(x+ky, y)$. We apply this transformation to the vector resulting from Step 1, which is $\\vec{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. The given shear factor is $k=4$.\nLet the final position vector be $\\vec{v}_{final} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{final} \\\\ y_{final} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe components of the final vector are calculated as:\n$$x_{final} = x_1 + k y_1$$\n$$y_{final} = y_1$$\nSubstituting the values of $x_1$, $y_1$, and $k$:\n$$x_{final} = -2 + (4)(3) = -2 + 12 = 10$$\n$$y_{final} = 3$$\nThus, the final position vector is $\\vec{v}_{final} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use matrix representations for the transformations.\nThe matrix for a reflection across the y-axis is $R_y = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe matrix for a horizontal shear with factor $k$ is $S_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSince the reflection is applied first, followed by the shear, the total transformation matrix $T$ is the product $T = S_x R_y$. The order of multiplication is crucial, as the first transformation matrix ($R_y$) is placed on the right.\n$$T = S_x R_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1)+(k)(0) & (1)(0)+(k)(1) \\\\ (0)(-1)+(1)(0) & (0)(0)+(1)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & k \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSubstituting the given value $k=4$:\n$$T = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe final vector $\\vec{v}_{final}$ is found by applying this transformation matrix to the initial vector $\\vec{v}_0$:\n$$\\vec{v}_{final} = T \\vec{v}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (-1)(2) + (4)(3) \\\\ (0)(2) + (1)(3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 + 12 \\\\ 0 + 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
