The familiar affine plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is embedded in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ via the mapping $(x_a, y_a) \\mapsto [x_a:y_a:1]$. Points with a zero $z$-coordinate are called \"points at infinity,\" and they represent directions in the affine plane. Specifically, the direction of a line defined by the vector $(u,v)$ in the affine plane is represented by the point at infinity $P_{dir} = [u:v:0]$.\n\nConsider a conic section $\\mathcal{C}$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ defined by the homogeneous quadratic equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$.

We will proceed in four steps: first, identify the homogeneous coordinates of the given point at infinity; second, use the provided formula to find the equation of its polar line; third, convert this line's equation into its affine form; and fourth, calculate the slope from the affine equation.\n\nStep 1: Identify the point at infinity.\nThe problem states that a direction vector $(u,v)$ in the affine plane corresponds to the point at infinity $P_{dir} = [u:v:0]$. We are given the direction vector $(1, 2)$. Therefore, the corresponding point at infinity, which is our pole, is $P_0 = [1:2:0]$. So, we have the homogeneous coordinates $x_0 = 1$, $y_0 = 2$, and $z_0 = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Find the equation of the polar line.\nThe polar line of a point $P_0 = [x_0:y_0:z_0]$ with respect to the conic $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ is given by the formula $x_0x + y_0y - z_0z = 0$. We substitute the coordinates of our point $P_0$ into this formula:\n$$ (1)x + (2)y - (0)z = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to the homogeneous equation of the polar line:\n$$ x + 2y = 0 $$\n\nStep 3: Convert the line to its affine form.\nTo view this line in the affine plane, we consider the subset of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ where $z \\neq 0$ and identify these points with the affine plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by setting $z=1$. Substituting $z=1$ into the homogeneous equation of the line gives the equation of the line in the affine plane. In our case, the equation $x + 2y = 0$ does not contain a $z$ term, so the equation remains unchanged in the affine coordinate system $(x,y)$:\n$$ x + 2y = 0 $$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the slope.\nThe slope of a line given by an equation of the form $Ax + By + C = 0$ is $m = -A/B$. Alternatively, we can rearrange our affine equation into the slope-intercept form, $y = mx + c$, where $m$ is the slope.\nStarting with $x + 2y = 0$, we solve for $y$:\n$$ 2y = -x $$\n$$ y = -\\frac{1}{2}x $$\nThis is in the form $y = mx+c$ with $m = -1/2$ and $c=0$. Thus, the slope of the polar line is $-1/2$.\n\nGeometrically, the conic $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ corresponds to the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$ in the affine plane. The pole is a point at infinity, representing a direction. The polar of a point at infinity with respect to a circle is a diameter of the circle. Specifically, it is the diameter that is perpendicular to the direction represented by the point at infinity. The direction vector is $(1,2)$, which corresponds to lines of slope $2$. The polar line $y = -1/2 x$ has a slope of $-1/2$.

The polar line of a point $P = [p_x, p_y, p_z]$ is given by the equation $\\mathbf{p}^T I \\mathbf{x} = 0$, which is $p_x x + p_y y + p_z z = 0$.\nThe key property of a self-polar triangle $V_1V_2V_3$ is that the polar of any vertex, say $V_i$, is the line passing through the other two vertices, $V_j$ and $V_k$. A direct consequence of this is that the vertices form a set of mutually conjugate points, meaning the polar of any one vertex contains the other two.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Polar Line of $V_1$**\nThe first vertex is given as $V_1 = [1, 2, 0]$.\nUsing the pole-polar relationship, the equation of the polar line of $V_1$, which we will call $L_1$, is:\n$$1 \\cdot x + 2 \\cdot y + 0 \\cdot z = 0$$\nSo, the equation for $L_1$ is $x + 2y = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Coordinates of $V_2$**\nThe second vertex, $V_2$, is the intersection of two lines:\n1.
