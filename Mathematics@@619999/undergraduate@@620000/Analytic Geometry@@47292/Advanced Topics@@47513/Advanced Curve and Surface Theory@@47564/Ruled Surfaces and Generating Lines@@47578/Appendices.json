This line, known as the generatrix, is constrained to move such that it is always parallel to the $yz$-plane. Furthermore, the generatrix must always intersect two specific skew lines in three-dimensional space. The first line, $L_1$, is defined by the pair of equations $y=a$ and $z=x$. The second line, $L_2$, is defined by the pair of equations $y=-a$ and $z=-x$. For these definitions, $a$ is a given non-zero real constant.\n\nFind the equation of this surface and express it in the form $z = f(x, y, a)$. Your task is to provide the expression for $f(x, y, a)$.", "solution": "Let $(x, y, z)$ be an arbitrary point on the ruled surface. By definition, this point must lie on one of the generating lines (generatrices).\n\nStep 1: Characterize the generatrix.\nThe problem states that each generatrix is parallel to the $yz$-plane. A line parallel to the $yz$-plane has a constant $x$-coordinate. Let's denote this constant value by $k$. Thus, any specific generatrix can be described as the set of points where $x=k$ for some other relation between $y$ and $z$. The parameter $k$ varies to sweep the entire surface. For our point $(x,y,z)$ on the surface, its $x$-coordinate defines the specific generatrix it lies on. So, we can set $k=x$.\n\nStep 2: Find the points where the generatrix intersects the given lines.\nA generatrix at a fixed $x$-coordinate must intersect both lines $L_1$ and $L_2$.\nLet's find the intersection point $P_1$ of the generatrix (where the x-coordinate is $x$) with the line $L_1$. The equations for $L_1$ are $y=a$ and $z=x$. Since the x-coordinate of the intersection point is $x$, its coordinates must be:\n$P_1 = (x, a, x)$.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the intersection point $P_2$ of the same generatrix with the line $L_2$. The equations for $L_2$ are $y=-a$ and $z=-x$. Again, the x-coordinate is $x$, so the coordinates of the intersection point must be:\n$P_2 = (x, -a, -x)$.\n\nStep 3: Establish the condition for the point $(x, y, z)$ to be on the generatrix.\nThe generatrix for a given $x$ is the straight line passing through the two points $P_1(x, a, x)$ and $P_2(x, -a, -x)$.\nFor the point $(x, y, z)$ to be on the surface, it must lie on this line. This means the point $(x, y, z)$ must be collinear with $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\nWe can express this condition using vectors. The vector from $P_2$ to the point $(x, y, z)$, let's call it $\\vec{V}$, must be parallel to the vector from $P_2$ to $P_1$, let's call it $\\vec{D}$.\n\nLet's compute these vectors:\nThe vector from $P_2$ to $(x,y,z)$ is:\n$\\vec{V} = (x, y, z) - (x, -a, -x) = (0, y+a, z+x)$\n\nThe direction vector of the generatrix, which can be represented by the vector from $P_2$ to $P_1$, is:\n$\\vec{D} = (x, a, x) - (x, -a, -x) = (0, a - (-a), x - (-x)) = (0, 2a, 2x)$\n\nStep 4: Formulate and solve the equation from the collinearity condition.\nThe condition that $\\vec{V}$ is parallel to $\\vec{D}$ means that one is a scalar multiple of the other. That is, $\\vec{V} = \\lambda \\vec{D}$ for some scalar $\\lambda$.\n$(0, y+a, z+x) = \\lambda (0, 2a, 2x)$\n\nThis vector equation yields a system of three scalar equations:\n1. $0 = \\lambda \\cdot 0$ (This is trivially true and provides no information).\n2. $y+a = \\lambda (2a)$\n3. $z+x = \\lambda (2x)$\n\nWe can now eliminate the parameter $\\lambda$ to find a relationship between $x, y,$ and $z$.\nFrom equation (2), since $a$ is a non-zero constant, we can solve for $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{y+a}{2a}$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $\\lambda$ into equation (3):\n$z+x = \\left(\\frac{y+a}{2a}\\right)(2x)$\n\nNow, we simplify this equation. The factor of 2 cancels out:\n$z+x = \\frac{x(y+a)}{a}$\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by $a$:\n$a(z+x) = x(y+a)$\n$az + ax = xy + ax$\n\nSubtracting $ax$ from both sides gives the equation of the surface:\n$az = xy$\n\nStep 5: Express the answer in the required format.\nThe problem asks for the expression $f(x, y, a)$ where the surface equation is written as $z = f(x, y, a)$. Since $a$ is non-zero, we can divide by $a$:\n$z = \\frac{xy}{a}$\n\nTherefore, the function $f(x, y, a)$ is $\\frac{xy}{a}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{xy}{a}}$$", "id": "2155826"}, {"introduction": "This final practice tackles a classic and powerful result in geometry: defining a surface from three skew lines.
