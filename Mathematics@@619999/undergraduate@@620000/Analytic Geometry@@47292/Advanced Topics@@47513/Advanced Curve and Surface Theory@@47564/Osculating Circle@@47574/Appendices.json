All coordinates are measured in meters. The constant parameter $\\alpha$ is given as $\\alpha = 0.023 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$. For safety and performance analysis, it is crucial to determine the characteristics of the tightest part of the turn, which occurs at the very bottom of the dip (the vertex of the parabola).
