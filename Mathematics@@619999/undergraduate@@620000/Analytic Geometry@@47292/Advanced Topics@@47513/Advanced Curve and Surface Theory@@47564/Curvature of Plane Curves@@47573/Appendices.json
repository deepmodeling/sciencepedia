This first practice focuses on calculating curvature at a vertex, where the tangent is horizontal and the formula simplifies, providing a clear entry point into the concept. By matching the curvature of a complex curve with a simpler one, like a parabola, you will explore a powerful technique used in design and engineering for approximation and optimization [@problem_id:2119395].", "problem": "In the design of a specialized mirror, the cross-sectional profile of the central reflective surface is initially modeled by the curve $f(x) = \\ln(\\sec(x))$, where $x$ represents the horizontal distance from the center. The manufacturing process, however, can more easily produce parabolic surfaces. The engineers decide to approximate the central part of the mirror with a parabola of the form $g(x) = ax^2$, where $a$ is a positive constant. To ensure the best possible fit at the very center ($x=0$), the value of $a$ must be chosen such that the curvature of the parabola at its vertex is identical to the curvature of the reference curve $f(x)$ at its minimum point ($x=0$). Find the required value of the constant $a$.", "solution": "We are asked to match the curvature at the center for two curves: the reference curve $f(x)=\\ln(\\sec(x))$ and the approximating parabola $g(x)=a x^{2}$, with $a>0$.
