This first practice invites you to explore this idea by starting with a familiar curve, a parabola, and applying a simple geometric rule. By finding the path traced by the reflection of the origin across every tangent line to the parabola, you will engage with core concepts of differential and analytic geometry and synthesize them to derive the parametric form of a new curve [@problem_id:2147242].", "problem": "A curve $C_1$ in the Cartesian plane is described by the complex parametric equation $z(t) = t^2 + 2it$, where $t$ is a real parameter. For each value of $t$, a tangent line to the curve $C_1$ at the point corresponding to $z(t)$ can be drawn. Let a new curve, $C_2$, be defined as the locus of points obtained by reflecting the origin $(0,0)$ across each of these tangent lines as $t$ varies over the real numbers.\n\nDetermine the Cartesian parametric equations $x_R(t)$ and $y_R(t)$ for the curve $C_2$. Express your answer as a pair of functions $(x_R(t), y_R(t))$.", "solution": "The solution involves finding the equation of the tangent line to the curve $C_1$ for a general parameter $t$, and then finding the reflection of the origin across this line.\n\nStep 1: Express the curve $C_1$ in Cartesian parametric equations.\nThe complex parametric equation is given by $z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)$.\nWe are given $z(t) = t^2 + 2it$. By equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain the Cartesian parametric equations for the curve $C_1$:\n$x(t) = t^2$\n$y(t) = 2t$\n\nThis curve is a parabola, as we can eliminate the parameter $t$. From $y(t) = 2t$, we get $t = y/2$. Substituting this into the equation for $x(t)$ gives $x = (y/2)^2 = y^2/4$, or $y^2 = 4x$.\n\nStep 2: Find the equation of the tangent line.\nTo find the slope of the tangent line at a point corresponding to parameter $t$, we compute the derivatives of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ with respect to $t$.\n$x'(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = 2t$\n$y'(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt} = 2$\n\nThe slope $m(t)$ of the tangent line is given by $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$. For $t \\neq 0$:\n$m(t) = \\frac{2}{2t} = \\frac{1}{t}$\nFor the case $t=0$, the point on the curve is $(0,0)$ and the tangent vector $(x'(0), y'(0)) = (0, 2)$ is vertical, corresponding to the line $x=0$.\n\nThe point-slope form of the equation of the tangent line at the point $(x(t), y(t)) = (t^2, 2t)$ is:\n$y - y(t) = m(t)(x - x(t))$\n$y - 2t = \\frac{1}{t}(x - t^2)$\n\nMultiplying by $t$ (for $t \\neq 0$) to clear the denominator, we get:\n$t(y - 2t) = x - t^2$\n$ty - 2t^2 = x - t^2$\nRearranging the terms gives the general equation of the tangent line:\n$x - ty + t^2 = 0$\nWe note that for $t=0$, this equation becomes $x=0$, which correctly represents the tangent line at the origin. Thus, this equation is valid for all real $t$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the coordinates of the reflected point.\nLet the origin be $O=(0,0)$ and its reflection across the tangent line be the point $R=(x_R, y_R)$. The reflection has two key geometric properties:\n1. The line segment $OR$ is perpendicular to the tangent line.\n2. The midpoint of the segment $OR$ lies on the tangent line.\n\nProperty 1: The slope of the tangent line is $m = 1/t$. The slope of the line segment $OR$, which is perpendicular to the tangent, must be the negative reciprocal, $m_{OR} = -t$. The slope of $OR$ is also given by $\\frac{y_R - 0}{x_R - 0} = \\frac{y_R}{x_R}$.\nTherefore, we have our first equation relating $x_R$ and $y_R$:\n$\\frac{y_R}{x_R} = -t \\implies y_R = -tx_R$\n\nProperty 2: The midpoint of the segment $OR$ is $M = \\left(\\frac{x_R+0}{2}, \\frac{y_R+0}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{x_R}{2}, \\frac{y_R}{2}\\right)$. Since this point $M$ lies on the tangent line $x - ty + t^2 = 0$, its coordinates must satisfy the equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{x_R}{2}\\right) - t\\left(\\frac{y_R}{2}\\right) + t^2 = 0$\nMultiplying by 2, we get our second equation:\n$x_R - ty_R + 2t^2 = 0$\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of equations for $x_R(t)$ and $y_R(t)$.\nWe now have a system of two linear equations in $x_R$ and $y_R$:\n(1) $y_R = -tx_R$\n(2) $x_R - ty_R + 2t^2 = 0$\n\nSubstitute equation (1) into equation (2):\n$x_R - t(-tx_R) + 2t^2 = 0$\n$x_R + t^2x_R + 2t^2 = 0$\n$x_R(1 + t^2) = -2t^2$\nSolving for $x_R(t)$, we get:\n$x_R(t) = \\frac{-2t^2}{1+t^2}$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $x_R(t)$ back into equation (1) to find $y_R(t)$:\n$y_R(t) = -t \\cdot x_R(t) = -t \\left( \\frac{-2t^2}{1+t^2} \\right)$\n$y_R(t) = \\frac{2t^3}{1+t^2}$\n\nThus, the parametric equations for the curve $C_2$, the locus of the reflected points, are:\n$x_R(t) = \\frac{-2t^2}{1+t^2}$\n$y_R(t) = \\frac{2t^3}{1+t^2}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{-2t^{2}}{1+t^{2}} & \\frac{2t^{3}}{1+t^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2147242"}, {"introduction": "Parametric equations are the natural language of kinematics.
