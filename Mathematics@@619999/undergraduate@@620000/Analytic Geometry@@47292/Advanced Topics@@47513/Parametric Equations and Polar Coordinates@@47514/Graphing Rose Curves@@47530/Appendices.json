The classical petal-count result applies to integer $n$; non-integer multipliers do not produce a standard rose with a finite, well-defined integer number of distinct petals over $0\\leq\\theta2\\pi$. In particular, $5.5=11/2$ leads to a curve that retraces and does not yield exactly $11$ distinct lobes.\n- E: $r=2\\sin(11\\theta)$ has $n=11$ (thus $11$ lobes) but $a=2$, so $r_{\\max}=2\\neq 4$.
