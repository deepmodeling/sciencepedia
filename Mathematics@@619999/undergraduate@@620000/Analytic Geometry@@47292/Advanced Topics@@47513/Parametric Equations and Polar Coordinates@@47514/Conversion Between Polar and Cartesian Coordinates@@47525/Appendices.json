This shape has the property of reflecting parallel incoming radio waves to a single focal point. Consider a simplified two-dimensional model of such a reflector. In a Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y)$, the parabola has its vertex at the origin $(0, 0)$ and opens upwards along the positive $y$-axis. Its shape is described by the equation $x^2 = 4ay$, where $a$ is a positive constant known as the focal length.\n\nTo facilitate calculations involving angles from the origin, it is useful to represent this curve in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$. The pole is located at the Cartesian origin, and the polar axis coincides with the positive $x$-axis.
