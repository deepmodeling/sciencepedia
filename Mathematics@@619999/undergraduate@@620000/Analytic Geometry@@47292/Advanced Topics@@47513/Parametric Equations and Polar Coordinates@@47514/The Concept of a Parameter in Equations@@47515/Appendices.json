This inequality holds for $-2 < c < 0$.\nFor any $c$ in the interval $(-2, 0)$, we have $c < \\frac{1}{4}$, so two distinct roots for $y$ exist. One root $y_1$ satisfies $y_1 > -1$ (giving two x-values), and the other root $y_2$ satisfies $y_2 < -1$ (giving no x-values). This results in a total of exactly two intersection points.\n\nLet's check the boundary cases where $f(-1) = 0$, which occurs at $c=0$ and $c=-2$. In these cases, one of the roots for $y$ is exactly $-1$.\n- If $c = 0$: Equation (Q) becomes $y^2 + y = 0 \\implies y(y+1) = 0$.

(One point)\n    - For $y_2=-4$ (which is < -1), there are no real x-values.\n    Total number of intersection points is 1.\n\nCombining the results from both scenarios, the parabola and circle intersect at exactly two distinct points if $c \\in (-2, 0)$ or if $c = \\frac{1}{4}$.
