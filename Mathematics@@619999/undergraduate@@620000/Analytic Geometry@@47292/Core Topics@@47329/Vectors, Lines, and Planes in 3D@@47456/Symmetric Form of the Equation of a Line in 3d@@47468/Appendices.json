Since the coefficient of $t$ is zero (i.e., $c=0$), we cannot solve for $t$ in terms of $z$. This means that the $z$-coordinate is constant for all points on the line. The equation $z=7$ must be stated separately.\n\nNow, we equate the expressions for $t$ that we found from the $x$ and $y$ equations:\n$\\frac{x-2}{3} = \\frac{y+5}{-1}$\n\nCombining this with the equation for the $z$-coordinate, we get the set of equations that describe the line:\n$\\frac{x-2}{3} = \\frac{y+5}{-1}, z=7$\n\nThis is a mixed form, combining symmetric equations for $x$ and $y$ with a parametric-style equation for $z$. This form is necessary because one of the components of the direction vector is zero.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA. $\\frac{x+2}{3} = \\frac{y-5}{-1}, z=7$: This incorrectly uses $(-2, 5, 7)$ as the point, by flipping the signs of the coordinates in the formula $(x-x_0)/a$.\nB. $\\frac{x-2}{3} = \\frac{y+5}{-1} = \\frac{z-7}{0}$: This is a common mistake. Division by zero is undefined, so this form is mathematically invalid. This illustrates the special case when a direction number is zero.\nC. $x=2, y=-5, \\frac{z-7}{0}$: This implies a direction vector of $\\langle 0, 0, \\text{something} \\rangle$ and a point $(2,-5,7)$, which is incorrect.\nD. $\\frac{x-2}{3} = \\frac{y+5}{-1}, z=7$: This matches our derived equations precisely.\nE. $x = 2+3t, y = -5-t, z=0$: This is a set of parametric equations, but it incorrectly states $z=0$ instead of $z=7$.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of equations is given in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2160491"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental question in 3D geometry is determining the relationship between two lines: do they intersect, are they parallel, or are they skew?
