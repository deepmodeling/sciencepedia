To simplify, we can divide by 20, yielding the normal vector $\\vec{n}_1 = \\langle 1, -1, -1 \\rangle$.\nThe equation of a plane is given by $\\vec{n} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_0) = 0$, where $\\vec{r}_0$ is the position vector of a point on the plane.

Let's use $\\vec{d} = \\langle 7, 5, 2 \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we need to find a point $\\vec{p}_0$ that lies on this line, meaning it must satisfy both plane equations:\n1) $x - y - z = 0$\n2) $x - 3y + 4z = 8$\nWe can find a point by setting one of the variables to a constant.

The position vector for this point is $\\vec{p}_0 = \\langle -4, -4, 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the vector equation of the line.**\nThe vector equation of the line $L$ is given by $\\vec{r}(t) = \\vec{p}_0 + t\\vec{d}$. Using the point and direction vector we found:\n$$ \\vec{r}(t) = \\langle -4, -4, 0 \\rangle + t \\langle 7, 5, 2 \\rangle $$\nThis equation describes the line of intersection of the two planes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2168843"}]}
