The position coordinates are measured in meters. The probe is engineered to travel in a perfectly straight line. Its motion is constrained such that its $x$ and $z$ coordinates remain constant throughout its flight. The probe moves at a constant speed of $3$ m/s in the direction of the negative $y$-axis.
