We need to follow a few steps: first, find the starting point of the line; second, write the parametric equations of the line; and third, find the intersection of the line with the given plane.\n\nStep 1: Find the starting point of the line.\nThe line starts at the midpoint of the segment connecting points $A(2, 4, 0)$ and $B(0, 0, 6)$. Let's call this midpoint $M$. The coordinates of the midpoint $M(x_M, y_M, z_M)$ are the average of the corresponding coordinates of A and B.\n$$x_M = \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2} = \\frac{2 + 0}{2} = 1$$\n$$y_M = \\frac{y_A + y_B}{2} = \\frac{4 + 0}{2} = 2$$\n$$z_M = \\frac{z_A + z_B}{2} = \\frac{0 + 6}{2} = 3$$\nSo, the starting point of the line is $M(1, 2, 3)$.\n\nStep 2: Write the parametric equations of the line.\nA line in three-dimensional space can be represented by a point on the line and a direction vector. We have the point $M(1, 2, 3)$ and the direction vector $\\vec{d} = \\langle 1, -1, 1 \\rangle$.\nThe parametric equations of the line are given by $\\vec{r}(t) = M + t\\vec{d}$, where $t$ is a real parameter.\nIn component form, this is:\n$$x(t) = x_M + t \\cdot d_x = 1 + t(1) = 1 + t$$\n$$y(t) = y_M + t \\cdot d_y = 2 + t(-1) = 2 - t$$\n$$z(t) = z_M + t \\cdot d_z = 3 + t(1) = 3 + t$$\n\nStep 3: Find the intersection of the line with the plane.\nThe equation of the plane is given as $z=10$. The intersection point must lie on both the line and the plane. Therefore, its coordinates must satisfy the equations of both. We can substitute the parametric expression for $z$ from the line into the equation of the plane.\n$$z(t) = 10$$\n$$3 + t = 10$$\nSolving for the parameter $t$:\n$$t = 10 - 3 = 7$$\nThis value of $t$ corresponds to the point of intersection.\n\nStep 4: Determine the coordinates of the intersection point.\nNow, we substitute $t=7$ back into the parametric equations for $x$ and $y$ to find the coordinates of the intersection point.\n$$x = 1 + t = 1 + 7 = 8$$\n$$y = 2 - t = 2 - 7 = -5$$\n$$z = 3 + t = 3 + 7 = 10$$\nThe coordinates of the intersection point are $(8, -5, 10)$.

This exercise challenges you to first derive the equation of a plane from its geometric properties—specifically, a point it contains and a line to which it is orthogonal.
