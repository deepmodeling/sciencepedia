To find this, we need to identify the normal vector to the plane, $\\vec{n}$, and a point on the plane, let's call it $P_0$. The equation of the plane is given by the dot product relation $\\vec{n} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{p_0}) = 0$, where $\\vec{r} = \\langle x, y, z \\rangle$ is the position vector of any point on the plane and $\\vec{p_0}$ is the position vector of the known point $P_0$.
