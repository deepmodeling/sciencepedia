The magnitude of this field is not uniform but varies with the radial distance $r$ from the pivot according to the relation $B(r) = B_0(1-r/L)$, where $B_0$ is a positive constant representing the magnetic field strength at the pivot ($r=0$), and $L$ is the length of the rod. Find the magnitude of the electromotive force (EMF) induced between the pivot and the free end of the rod.\n\n", "solution": "The motional electromotive force (EMF) is induced due to the motion of the conducting rod through the magnetic field. The magnetic part of the Lorentz force on the charge carriers (with charge $q$) within the rod is given by $\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$, where $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of a segment of the rod. This force per unit charge acts as an effective electric field, $\\vec{E}_{\\text{eff}} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$.\n\nThe EMF, $\\mathcal{E}$, between the two ends of the rod is the line integral of this effective electric field along the length of the rod.\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\int_{\\text{rod}} \\vec{E}_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\int_{\\text{rod}} (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot d\\vec{l} $$\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system to evaluate this integral. Let the pivot be at the origin of a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\phi, z)$. The rod rotates in the $xy$-plane, so its position can be described by the radial coordinate $r$ which ranges from $0$ to $L$. The angular velocity is constant and can be represented by the vector $\\vec{\\omega} = \\omega \\hat{z}$, where $\\hat{z}$ is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of rotation.\n\nThe magnetic field is given as perpendicular to the plane of rotation, so we can write it as $\\vec{B}(r) = B(r) \\hat{z} = B_0(1 - r/L) \\hat{z}$.\n\nA point on the rod at a radial distance $r$ from the pivot has a velocity $\\vec{v}$ given by the relation for circular motion:\n$$ \\vec{v} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r} $$\nIn our coordinate system, $\\vec{r} = r\\hat{r}$, where $\\hat{r}$ is the radial unit vector in the plane.\n$$ \\vec{v} = (\\omega \\hat{z}) \\times (r \\hat{r}) = \\omega r (\\hat{z} \\times \\hat{r}) $$\nUsing the right-hand rule for the cross product of cylindrical unit vectors, $\\hat{z} \\times \\hat{r} = \\hat{\\phi}$, where $\\hat{\\phi}$ is the azimuthal unit vector.\nSo, the velocity of a segment of the rod at distance $r$ is $\\vec{v} = \\omega r \\hat{\\phi}$.\n\nNow we can compute the cross product $\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$:\n$$ \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (\\omega r \\hat{\\phi}) \\times (B_0(1 - r/L) \\hat{z}) = \\omega r B_0(1 - r/L) (\\hat{\\phi} \\times \\hat{z}) $$\nThe cross product of the unit vectors is $\\hat{\\phi} \\times \\hat{z} = -\\hat{r}$.\nThus, the effective electric field is:\n$$ \\vec{E}_{\\text{eff}} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\omega r B_0(1 - r/L) \\hat{r} $$\nThis field is directed radially inward along the rod.\n\nThe line element $d\\vec{l}$ for the integration is a small segment of the rod, which is directed radially outward from the pivot. So, $d\\vec{l} = dr \\, \\hat{r}$.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral for the EMF. The integration is performed from the pivot ($r=0$) to the free end ($r=L$):\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\int_0^L \\left( -\\omega r B_0(1 - r/L) \\hat{r} \\right) \\cdot (dr \\, \\hat{r}) $$\nSince $\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{r} = 1$, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = -\\int_0^L \\omega r B_0(1 - r/L) dr $$\nWe can take the constants $\\omega$ and $B_0$ out of the integral:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = -B_0 \\omega \\int_0^L r(1 - r/L) dr = -B_0 \\omega \\int_0^L (r - \\frac{r^2}{L}) dr $$\nNow, we perform the integration:\n$$ \\int_0^L (r - \\frac{r^2}{L}) dr = \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^3}{3L} \\right]_0^L $$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits:\n$$ = \\left( \\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{3L} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{0^2}{2} - \\frac{0^3}{3L} \\right) = \\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{L^2}{3} $$\n$$ = L^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = L^2 \\left( \\frac{3-2}{6} \\right) = \\frac{L^2}{6} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\mathcal{E}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = -B_0 \\omega \\left( \\frac{L^2}{6} \\right) = -\\frac{B_0 \\omega L^2}{6} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the potential at the free end ($r=L$) is lower than the potential at the pivot ($r=0$). The problem asks for the magnitude of the EMF.\n$$ |\\mathcal{E}| = \\left| -\\frac{B_0 \\omega L^2}{6} \\right| = \\frac{B_0 \\omega L^2}{6} $$", "answer": "\n$$ \\boxed{\\frac{B_0 \\omega L^2}{6}} $$\n"}, {"introduction": "Advanced theoretical physics can appear computationally intensive, yet elegant solutions often emerge from a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical structure.
