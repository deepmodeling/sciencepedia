Both $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.\n\nThe latus rectum of a hyperbola is a chord passing through a focus, perpendicular to the transverse axis. Its total length is given by the formula $\\frac{2b^2}{a}$. The semi-latus rectum is half the length of the latus rectum. Let's denote the length of the semi-latus rectum by $l$.\n$$l = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2b^2}{a} \\right) = \\frac{b^2}{a}$$\n\nThe problem states that the length of the semi-latus rectum is equal to the length of the semi-transverse axis. The length of the semi-transverse axis is $a$. Therefore, we have the condition:\n$$l = a$$\nSubstituting our expression for $l$, we get:\n$$\\frac{b^2}{a} = a$$\nMultiplying both sides by $a$ (which is non-zero), we find a relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$$b^2 = a^2$$\n\nNext, we need to find the eccentricity, $e$. The eccentricity of a hyperbola is related to the parameters $a$ and $b$ by the formula:\n$$e^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2$$\nWe can also write this as $e^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^2}$. This formula is derived from the fundamental relationship for a hyperbola, $c^2 = a^2+b^2$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to a focus, and $e = \\frac{c}{a}$.\n\nNow, we use the condition we derived, $b^2 = a^2$. We can substitute this into the formula for eccentricity:\n$$e^2 = 1 + \\frac{a^2}{a^2}$$\n$$e^2 = 1 + 1$$\n$$e^2 = 2$$\n\nTo find the eccentricity $e$, we take the square root of both sides.
