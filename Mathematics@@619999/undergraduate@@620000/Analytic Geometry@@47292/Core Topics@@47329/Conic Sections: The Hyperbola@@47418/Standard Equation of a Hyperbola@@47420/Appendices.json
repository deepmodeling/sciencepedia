This exercise frames the hyperbola in the classic context of a sound-ranging system, where the curve represents all possible locations of an event based on the time difference of sound arrival at two points. By working through this problem [@problem_id:2109931], you will directly engage with the core principle that defines a hyperbola: the constant difference in distances from any point on the curve to its two foci.", "problem": "A sound-ranging system is used to determine the location of a distant event, like an explosion. The system consists of two listening stations, which we can model as two points, $F_1$ and $F_2$, on a large, flat plane. The system works by measuring the difference in the arrival time of the sound at the two stations. This time difference corresponds to a constant difference in the distance from the event to each station.\n\nAfter a particular event, the system's computer determines that the set of all possible locations $(x, y)$ of the event lies on a curve defined by the equation:\n$$ \\frac{x^2}{16} - \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1 $$\nHere, the coordinates $x$ and $y$ are measured in kilometers. The listening stations are the foci of this curve.
