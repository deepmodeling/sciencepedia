Imagine a ray of light that perfectly retraces its path after striking a hyperbolic mirror. This exercise [@problem_id:2154537] asks you to determine the specific point on the mirror where this \"perfect rebound\" occurs, forcing you to connect the abstract reflective property to a concrete geometric condition.", "problem": "A hyperbolic mirror is designed based on the hyperbola defined by the equation $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a = 8$ and $b = 6$. The hyperbola has two foci, one of which is located at $F_1 = (-c, 0)$ where $c > 0$. According to the reflective property of a hyperbola, a ray of light originating from one focus will reflect off the mirror along a path that appears to have originated from the other focus.\n\nConsider a special case where a light ray is emitted from the focus $F_1$. Find the coordinates of the point $P=(x_0, y_0)$ on the branch of the hyperbola with positive $x$-coordinates, such that the ray, upon striking the hyperbola at point $P$, reflects directly back along its incident path towards $F_1$. Provide the coordinates of this point $P$ as an ordered pair $(x_0, y_0)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for a point $P$ on a specific hyperbola such that a ray from one focus, $F_1$, reflects off the hyperbola at $P$ and travels back to $F_1$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the parameters and geometry of the hyperbola. The equation is given by $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, with $a = 8$ and $b = 6$. So the equation is $\\frac{x^2}{64} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1$.\n\nThe foci of a hyperbola with its transverse axis on the x-axis are located at $(\\pm c, 0)$, where $c$ is the focal distance. The relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$c^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100$$\n$$c = \\sqrt{100} = 10$$\nThe foci are therefore located at $F_1 = (-10, 0)$ and $F_2 = (10, 0)$.\n\nThe reflective property of the hyperbola states that a ray of light originating from one focus, say $F_1$, and striking the hyperbola at a point $P$, will reflect along the line that passes through the other focus, $F_2$, and the point $P$. The reflected ray travels away from $F_2$.\n\nThe problem specifies a unique condition: the ray originating from $F_1$ must reflect at $P$ and travel directly back to $F_1$. This means the path of the reflected ray must be the line segment $PF_1$.\n\nBased on the reflective property, the reflected ray's path is the line $\\overleftrightarrow{F_2P}$. For the reflected ray to travel back to $F_1$, the line $\\overleftrightarrow{F_2P}$ must be the same as the line $\\overleftrightarrow{F_1P}$. This can only occur if the three points $F_1$, $F_2$, and $P$ are collinear.\n\nThe line that passes through the two foci, $F_1(-10, 0)$ and $F_2(10, 0)$, is the transverse axis of the hyperbola. In this case, the transverse axis is the x-axis, which is described by the equation $y=0$.\n\nTherefore, the point $P$ must be one of the intersection points of the hyperbola and its transverse axis. These intersection points are the vertices of the hyperbola. To find their coordinates, we set $y=0$ in the hyperbola's equation:\n$$\\frac{x^2}{64} - \\frac{0^2}{36} = 1$$\n$$\\frac{x^2}{64} = 1$$\n$$x^2 = 64$$\n$$x = \\pm \\sqrt{64} = \\pm 8$$\n\nSo, the two points on the hyperbola that are collinear with the foci are the vertices, $V_1 = (-8, 0)$ and $V_2 = (8, 0)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the point $P=(x_0, y_0)$ on the branch of the hyperbola with positive $x$-coordinates. Comparing the two possible points, $V_1$ has a negative x-coordinate and $V_2$ has a positive x-coordinate. Thus, the required point is $P = V_2 = (8, 0)$.\n\nLet's verify this. A ray leaves $F_1(-10, 0)$ and travels to $P(8, 0)$. The incident path is along the x-axis. At $P(8,0)$, the tangent to the hyperbola is a vertical line. The normal to the hyperbola at this vertex is the x-axis itself. Since the incident ray lies along the normal, it reflects back along the normal, i.e., back towards $F_1(-10, 0)$. This is consistent with the general principle of reflection where a ray striking a surface along its normal reflects back upon itself. The geometry also aligns with the reflective property, as a ray appearing to come from $F_2(10,0)$ and passing through $P(8,0)$ would travel along the negative x-axis, which is the path of the reflected ray.\n\nThe coordinates of the point $P$ are $(8, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(8, 0)}$$", "id": "2154537"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a special case, we now move to the fundamental application of the reflective property. This practice [@problem_id:2154519] challenges you to calculate the precise trajectory of a reflected light ray.

The light source is at $F_2 = (c, 0)$. Consequently, the reflected ray at $P$ is collinear with the line through $P$ and the other focus, $F_1 = (-c, 0)$, and is directed away from $F_1$. The slope of the reflected ray is therefore the slope of the line through $P$ and $F_1$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{b - 0}{a \\sqrt{2} - (-c)} = \\frac{b}{a \\sqrt{2} + c}\n$$\nSubstituting $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ yields the slope expressed solely in terms of $a$ and $b$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{b}{a \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{b}{a \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}}}$$", "id": "2154519"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates the concept to a more dynamic system, like a cosmic billiard shot involving multiple reflections.

According to the reflective property, the tangent at $P_1$ bisects the angle $\\angle F_1P_1F_2$. The reflected ray travels along the line extending from the *other* focus ($F_2$) through the point of reflection ($P_1$). This means the ray travels *away* from focus $F_2$. Such a ray would travel outwards and would never strike the right branch of the hyperbola.\n\n2.  **Addressing the Problem's Premise:** The problem statement asserts that the ray *does* travel from $P_1$ to a point $P_2$ on the right branch. This premise contradicts the physical laws of reflection for a standard hyperbolic mirror. However, to solve the problem as intended, we must assume the described path occurs. This implies the path from $P_1$ to $P_2$ must be along a line that passes through the focus $F_2$.\n\n3.  **Second Reflection (at $P_2$ on the right branch):** Based on the premise from the previous step, the ray arrives at point $P_2$ along a path that is directed *towards* the focus $F_2$.\n\n4.  **Applying the Reflective Property at $P_2$:** The reflective property also applies to rays converging on a focus. A ray that is traveling towards one focus (in this case, $F_2$) will reflect off the hyperbola and travel along a line that passes through the *other* focus (in this case, $F_1$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the ray arriving at $P_2$ is directed towards focus $F_2$, it will reflect from the right branch and travel along the line passing through focus $F_1$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the ray, after the second reflection at $P_2$, travels along the line passing through the focus $F_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2154508"}]}
