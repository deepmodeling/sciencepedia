This first exercise [@problem_id:2132614] provides practice in this fundamental skill by requiring you to construct the general equation of a circle from two simple conditions: its tangency to an axis and the requirement that it passes through a specific point.

The placement must satisfy two critical geometric constraints. First, the boundary of the sensor's detection range must be tangent to a long, straight barrier that lies along the x-axis. The exact point of tangency is specified to be $(4, 0)$. Second, the detection boundary must also pass through a specific monitoring post located at the coordinates $(8, 2)$. The equation describing the boundary of the sensor's range can be written in the general form $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$.
