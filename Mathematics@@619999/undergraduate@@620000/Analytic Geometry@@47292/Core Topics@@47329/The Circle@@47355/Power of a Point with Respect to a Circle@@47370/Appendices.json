There exists a locus of points $P(x,y)$ in the plane from which the length of a tangent segment drawn to $C_1$ is equal to the length of a tangent segment drawn to $C_2$. This locus forms a straight line.\n\nCalculate the x-intercept of this line. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let a general point in the locus be $P(x,y)$. We need to find the equation describing all such points.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations for the two circles based on the provided information.\nThe standard equation for a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.\n\nFor circle $C_1$, the center is $(0,0)$ and the radius is $r_1 = 3$. Its equation is:\n$C_1: (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 3^2 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 9$\n\nFor circle $C_2$, the center is $(5,0)$ and the radius is $r_2 = 1$. Its equation is:\n$C_2: (x-5)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 1^2 \\implies (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 1$\n\nNow, consider a tangent from the point $P(x,y)$ to a circle. Let the point of tangency on the circle be $T$, the center of the circle be $C$, and the radius be $r$. The radius to the point of tangency, $CT$, is perpendicular to the tangent line $PT$. This forms a right-angled triangle $\\triangle PTC$, with the right angle at $T$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the distance from $P$ to the center, $(PC)^2$, is equal to the sum of the square of the tangent length, $(PT)^2$, and the square of the radius, $r^2$.\n$(PC)^2 = (PT)^2 + r^2$\nTherefore, the square of the length of the tangent segment is given by:\n$(PT)^2 = (PC)^2 - r^2$\nThis quantity is also known as the power of the point $P$ with respect to the circle.\n\nLet $L_1$ be the length of the tangent from $P(x,y)$ to circle $C_1$. The center of $C_1$ is $C_1(0,0)$ and its radius is $r_1=3$. The square of the distance from $P$ to the center of $C_1$ is $(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = x^2+y^2$.\nSo, the square of the tangent length is:\n$L_1^2 = (x^2 + y^2) - r_1^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 3^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 9$\n\nLet $L_2$ be the length of the tangent from $P(x,y)$ to circle $C_2$. The center of $C_2$ is $C_2(5,0)$ and its radius is $r_2=1$. The square of the distance from $P$ to the center of $C_2$ is $(x-5)^2 + (y-0)^2 = (x-5)^2+y^2$.\nSo, the square of the tangent length is:\n$L_2^2 = ((x-5)^2 + y^2) - r_2^2 = (x-5)^2 + y^2 - 1^2 = (x-5)^2 + y^2 - 1$\n\nThe problem states that the lengths of the tangents are equal, i.e., $L_1 = L_2$. This is equivalent to their squares being equal, $L_1^2 = L_2^2$.\n$x^2 + y^2 - 9 = (x-5)^2 + y^2 - 1$\n\nNow, we expand the term $(x-5)^2$:\n$x^2 + y^2 - 9 = (x^2 - 10x + 25) + y^2 - 1$\n\nWe can simplify this equation by canceling terms that appear on both sides. The $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms cancel out:\n$-9 = -10x + 25 - 1$\n$-9 = -10x + 24$\n\nNow, we solve for $x$:\n$10x = 24 + 9$\n$10x = 33$\n$x = \\frac{33}{10} = 3.3$\n\nThe equation of the locus of points is $x = 3.3$.

For a vertical line with equation $x=k$, the x-intercept is simply $k$.\nIn our case, the x-intercept is $3.3$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe number $3.3$ has two significant figures.
