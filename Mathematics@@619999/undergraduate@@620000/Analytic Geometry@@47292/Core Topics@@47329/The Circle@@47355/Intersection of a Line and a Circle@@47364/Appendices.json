Its trajectory is a straight line. The particle is first observed at position $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and later at position $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$. At the origin of the coordinate system, $(0,0)$, there is a powerful, localized force field whose region of influence is a circle of radius $R$. The particle's trajectory is observed to be tangent to the boundary of this circular region, meaning it grazes the edge of the field without entering it.\n\nAssuming that the points $P_1$ and $P_2$ are distinct, and that the origin does not lie on the line connecting them, derive an analytic expression for the radius $R$ of the force field in terms of the coordinates $x_1, y_1, x_2$, and $y_2$.", "solution": "The trajectory of the particle is a straight line through $P_{1}=(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $P_{2}=(x_{2},y_{2})$.
