The final answer should be the ordered triplet $(a, b, c)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the coefficients of the equation of a line that defines a chord of a given circle.\n\nFirst, let's identify the properties of the circle from its equation $(x-2)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 25$. The center of the circle is $C(2, -1)$ and its radius is $R = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\n\nThe chord, along with the two radii to its endpoints, forms an isosceles triangle with the center of the circle $C$ as one vertex. Let the length of the chord be $L$ and let $d$ be the perpendicular distance from the center $C$ to the chord. The area of this triangle, $A$, is given by half the product of its base (the chord length $L$) and its height (the distance $d$).\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} L d$$\nThe radius, the distance $d$, and half the chord length ($L/2$) form a right-angled triangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n$$d^2 + \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2 = R^2$$\nFrom this, we can express the chord length $L$ in terms of $d$ and $R$:\n$$\\frac{L^2}{4} = R^2 - d^2 \\implies L = 2\\sqrt{R^2 - d^2}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $L$ into the area formula:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(2\\sqrt{R^2 - d^2}\\right) d = d\\sqrt{R^2 - d^2}$$\nWe are given that $A=10$ and we know $R=5$. Substituting these values:\n$$10 = d\\sqrt{5^2 - d^2} = d\\sqrt{25 - d^2}$$\nTo solve for $d$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$100 = d^2(25 - d^2)$$\nLet $u = d^2$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $u$:\n$$100 = 25u - u^2$$\n$$u^2 - 25u + 100 = 0$$\nWe can factor this quadratic equation:\n$$(u-5)(u-20) = 0$$\nThis gives two possible values for $u=d^2$: $d^2 = 5$ or $d^2 = 20$. Consequently, the possible distances from the center to the chord are $d = \\sqrt{5}$ or $d = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nNext, we use the information that the chord passes through the point $P(3,1)$.\nFor any line (chord) passing through a point $P$, the distance $d$ from the center $C$ to the line cannot be greater than the distance from the center $C$ to the point $P$. That is, $d \\leq |CP|$. Let's calculate the distance $|CP|$:\n$$|CP| = \\sqrt{(3-2)^2 + (1 - (-1))^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{1+4} = \\sqrt{5}$$\nNow we compare our possible values for $d$ with $|CP|=\\sqrt{5}$.\nCase 1: $d = \\sqrt{5}$. This satisfies the condition $d \\leq |CP|$, since $\\sqrt{5} \\leq \\sqrt{5}$.\nCase 2: $d = 2\\sqrt{5}$. This violates the condition, since $2\\sqrt{5} > \\sqrt{5}$. A line passing through point $P$ cannot be at a distance of $2\\sqrt{5}$ from the center $C$. Therefore, this case is geometrically impossible.\n\nWe conclude that the distance from the center to the chord must be $d = \\sqrt{5}$.\nFurthermore, because the distance from the center to the line ($d$) is equal to the distance from the center to the point $P$ on the line ($|CP|$), the point $P$ must be the foot of the perpendicular from the center $C$ to the chord.\n\nThis means that the vector $\\vec{CP}$ is normal (perpendicular) to the line of the chord. The vector is:\n$$\\vec{CP} = \\langle 3-2, 1-(-1) \\rangle = \\langle 1, 2 \\rangle$$\nThe slope of the line segment $CP$ is $m_{CP} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\nThe slope of the chord, $m$, must be the negative reciprocal of $m_{CP}$:\n$$m = -\\frac{1}{m_{CP}} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nNow we can find the equation of the line using the point-slope form with the point $P(3,1)$ and slope $m = -1/2$:\n$$y - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 3)$$\nTo get the required form $ax+by+c=0$ with integer coefficients, we multiply by 2:\n$$2(y - 1) = -(x - 3)$$\n$$2y - 2 = -x + 3$$\n$$x + 2y - 5 = 0$$\nThe coefficients are $a=1, b=2, c=-5$. These are integers. The greatest common divisor of $(1,2,5)$ is 1, so they are coprime.
