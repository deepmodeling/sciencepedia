We do this by completing the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms.\n\nRearranging the terms:\n$(x^2 + Dx) + (y^2 + Ey) = -F$\n\nCompleting the square for $x$:\n$(x^2 + Dx + (\\frac{D}{2})^2) - (\\frac{D}{2})^2 = (x + \\frac{D}{2})^2 - \\frac{D^2}{4}$\n\nCompleting the square for $y$:\n$(y^2 + Ey + (\\frac{E}{2})^2) - (\\frac{E}{2})^2 = (y + \\frac{E}{2})^2 - \\frac{E^2}{4}$\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation:\n$(x + \\frac{D}{2})^2 - \\frac{D^2}{4} + (y + \\frac{E}{2})^2 - \\frac{E^2}{4} = -F$\n\nMoving the constant terms to the right side gives the standard form:\n$(x + \\frac{D}{2})^2 + (y + \\frac{E}{2})^2 = \\frac{D^2}{4} + \\frac{E^2}{4} - F$\n\nFrom this standard form, we can identify the center $(h,k)$ and the square of the radius, $r^2$:\n-   Center: $(h,k) = (-\\frac{D}{2}, -\\frac{E}{2})$\n-   Radius squared: $r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{4} + \\frac{E^2}{4} - F$\n\nNext, we apply the given geometric constraints.\n\n1.  **The circle lies entirely within the first quadrant:** This implies that the center $(h,k)$ must be in the first quadrant, so $h > 0$ and $k > 0$. Also, the circle must not cross the axes, which means the distance from the center to any axis must be greater than the radius.\n    -   $h = -\\frac{D}{2} > 0 \\implies D < 0$\n    -   $k = -\\frac{E}{2} > 0 \\implies E < 0$\n\n2.  **The circle is tangent to both the x-axis and the y-axis:**\n    -   Tangency to the x-axis means the distance from the center $(h,k)$ to the x-axis is equal to the radius. This distance is $|k|$. So, $|k| = r$.\n    -   Tangency to the y-axis means the distance from the center $(h,k)$ to the y-axis is equal to the radius. This distance is $|h|$. So, $|h| = r$.\n    -   Combining these, we have $|h| = |k| = r$.\n\nSince the center $(h,k)$ is in the first quadrant, $h$ and $k$ are positive. Therefore, the tangency conditions simplify to $h = k = r$. Note that this also automatically satisfies the condition that the circle does not cross the axes (i.e., $h-r=0$ and $k-r=0$).\n\nNow, we translate these conditions into relationships between $D$, $E$, and $F$.\n\nFrom $h = k$:\n$-\\frac{D}{2} = -\\frac{E}{2} \\implies D = E$\n\nFrom $k = r$, which implies $k^2 = r^2$:\n$(-\\frac{E}{2})^2 = \\frac{D^2}{4} + \\frac{E^2}{4} - F$\n$\\frac{E^2}{4} = \\frac{D^2}{4} + \\frac{E^2}{4} - F$\n\nSubtracting $\\frac{E^2}{4}$ from both sides, we get:\n$0 = \\frac{D^2}{4} - F \\implies F = \\frac{D^2}{4} \\implies D^2 = 4F$\n\nSo, the fundamental necessary relationships are $D = E$ and $D^2 = 4F$.

So, B is incorrect.\n\n**C. $D^2 = E^2 = 4F$**\nThis statement combines two equalities: $D^2 = E^2$ and $E^2 = 4F$.\n-   Since we found $D=E$, squaring both sides gives $D^2 = E^2$. This is true.\n-   Since $D=E$ and $D^2=4F$, it follows that $E^2=4F$. This is also true.\nTherefore, the statement $D^2 = E^2 = 4F$ is a necessary relationship. So, C is correct.\n\n**D. $D = E$**\nWe derived this directly from the condition $h=k$. This is a necessary relationship. So, D is correct.\n\n**E. $D^2 + E^2 = 8F$**\nSubstitute $E=D$ and $F=D^2/4$:\nLeft side: $D^2 + D^2 = 2D^2$\nRight side: $8(\\frac{D^2}{4}) = 2D^2$\nThe left side equals the right side.
