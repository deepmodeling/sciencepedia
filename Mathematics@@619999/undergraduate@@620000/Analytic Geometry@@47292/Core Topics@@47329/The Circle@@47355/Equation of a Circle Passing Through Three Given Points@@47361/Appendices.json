The center of this circle is the circumcenter of the triangle formed by these three points. The circumcenter is the point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the segment $P_1P_2$.\nThe midpoint of the segment connecting $P_1(1, 1)$ and $P_2(5, 1)$ is:\n$$ M_{12} = \\left(\\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2}\\right) = (3, 1) $$\nThe slope of the segment $P_1P_2$ is:\n$$ m_{12} = \\frac{1 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\frac{0}{4} = 0 $$\nSince the segment $P_1P_2$ is horizontal, its perpendicular bisector is a vertical line passing through the midpoint $M_{12}(3, 1)$. The equation of this line is:\n$$ x = 3 $$\nThis tells us that the x-coordinate of the center is $h = 3$.\n\nNext, let's find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the segment $P_2P_3$.\nThe midpoint of the segment connecting $P_2(5, 1)$ and $P_3(3, 7)$ is:\n$$ M_{23} = \\left(\\frac{5+3}{2}, \\frac{1+7}{2}\\right) = (4, 4) $$\nThe slope of the segment $P_2P_3$ is:\n$$ m_{23} = \\frac{7 - 1}{3 - 5} = \\frac{6}{-2} = -3 $$\nThe slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of $m_{23}$:\n$$ m_{\\perp} = -\\frac{1}{m_{23}} = -\\frac{1}{-3} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nUsing the point-slope form of a line, the equation of the perpendicular bisector passing through $M_{23}(4, 4)$ with slope $m_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{3}$ is:\n$$ y - 4 = \\frac{1}{3}(x - 4) $$\nThe center of the circle $(h, k)$ must lie on this line.

Let's use station $P_1(1, 1)$. The distance squared, $r^2$, is given by the distance formula:\n$$ r^2 = (x_1 - h)^2 + (y_1 - k)^2 $$\n$$ r^2 = (1 - 3)^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{11}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ r^2 = (-2)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{11}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ r^2 = 4 + \\left(-\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ r^2 = 4 + \\frac{64}{9} $$\n$$ r^2 = \\frac{36}{9} + \\frac{64}{9} = \\frac{100}{9} $$\nThe radius $r$ is the square root of this value. Since radius must be positive:\n$$ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{9}} = \\frac{10}{3} $$\nThe coordinates are given in km, so the radius is $r = \\frac{10}{3}$ km.\n\nThe required values are $h = 3$, $k = \\frac{11}{3}$, and $r = \\frac{10}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & \\frac{11}{3} & \\frac{10}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2124154"}, {"introduction": "While the geometric approach is intuitive, an equivalent algebraic method offers a powerful and systematic alternative.
