For a particular alignment test, a laser beam is directed towards the deepest point of the reflector, known as the vertex. The beam travels along the line that is normal to the parabolic surface at this vertex. Determine the x-intercept of the path followed by this laser beam.", "solution": "The problem asks for the x-intercept of the line normal to the parabola $x^2 + 4x + 4y + 16 = 0$ at its vertex.\n\nFirst, we must identify the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola. We can do this by rewriting the equation of the parabola in its standard form. The standard form for a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry is $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex.\n\nStarting with the given equation:\n$$x^2 + 4x + 4y + 16 = 0$$\nWe can complete the square for the terms involving $x$.\n$$(x^2 + 4x) + 4y + 16 = 0$$\nTo complete the square for $x^2 + 4x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is 4), square it ($2^2=4$), and add and subtract it inside the expression.\n$$(x^2 + 4x + 4) - 4 + 4y + 16 = 0$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is now a perfect square.\n$$(x+2)^2 + 4y + 12 = 0$$\nNow, we isolate the squared term and arrange the equation into the standard form.\n$$(x+2)^2 = -4y - 12$$\n$$(x+2)^2 = -4(y+3)$$\nComparing this to the standard form $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$, we can identify the vertex $(h,k)$.\nHere, $h = -2$ and $k = -3$. So, the vertex of the parabola is at the point $V(-2, -3)$.\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the tangent line to the parabola at the vertex. The parabola $(x+2)^2 = -4(y+3)$ has a vertical axis of symmetry (the line $x=-2$). The vertex is the point on the parabola where the tangent line is horizontal. A horizontal line has a slope of zero.\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at the vertex is $m_{\\text{tangent}} = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use calculus. We can find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ from the original equation using implicit differentiation:\n$$x^2 + 4x + 4y + 16 = 0$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) + \\frac{d}{dx}(4x) + \\frac{d}{dx}(4y) + \\frac{d}{dx}(16) = 0$$\n$$2x + 4 + 4\\frac{dy}{dx} + 0 = 0$$\n$$4\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x - 4$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{-2x-4}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}x - 1$$\nThe slope of the tangent at the vertex, where $x=-2$, is:\n$$m_{\\text{tangent}} = \\frac{dy}{dx}\\Big|_{x=-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}(-2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$$\n\nThe normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of contact. The product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is $-1$, i.e., $m_{\\text{normal}} \\cdot m_{\\text{tangent}} = -1$.\nSince the tangent line is horizontal ($m_{\\text{tangent}} = 0$), the normal line must be vertical. A vertical line has an undefined slope.\n\nThe equation of a vertical line is of the form $x = c$, where $c$ is a constant. Since the normal line passes through the vertex $(-2, -3)$, the value of $c$ must be the x-coordinate of the vertex.\nThus, the equation of the normal line is $x = -2$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the x-intercept of this normal line. The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, which is where $y=0$.\nThe equation of the line is $x=-2$. This equation means that for any value of $y$, the value of $x$ is always $-2$. Therefore, when $y=0$, $x=-2$.\nThe x-intercept is $-2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "2126374"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the special case of the vertex, we now consider the normal at an arbitrary point on the parabola. A fascinating property of the normal is that, unlike a tangent, it can intersect the parabola at a second, distinct point.
