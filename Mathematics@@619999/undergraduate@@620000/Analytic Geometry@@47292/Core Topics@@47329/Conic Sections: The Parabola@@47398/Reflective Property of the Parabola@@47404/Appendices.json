Express your answer as a single symbolic expression.", "solution": "The problem asks for the y-coordinate of the intersection point between a reflected ray and the directrix of a given parabola. Let's break down the problem into several steps.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parabola and its properties.**\nThe equation of the parabola is given by $y^2 = 8x$. This is a parabola of the form $y^2 = 4ax$ which opens to the right, with its vertex at the origin $(0,0)$.\nBy comparing the given equation with the standard form, we have $4a = 8$, which implies $a=2$.\nThe key properties of this parabola are:\n- Vertex: $V(0,0)$\n- Focus: $F(a,0) = (2,0)$\n- Directrix: The line $x = -a$, which is $x = -2$.\n- Axis of symmetry: The x-axis, i.e., the line $y=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the point of incidence P.**\nThe problem states that an incident light ray travels from the focus $F(2,0)$ to a point $P(x_0, y_0)$ on the parabola. The line segment $FP$ makes an angle of $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians with the positive x-axis.\nThe slope of the line containing the segment $FP$ is $m = \\tan(\\theta) = \\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$.\nUsing the point-slope form with the focus $F(2,0)$, the equation of the line is:\n$y - 0 = \\sqrt{3}(x - 2)$\n$y = \\sqrt{3}(x-2)$\n\nTo find the coordinates of the point of incidence $P$, we find the intersection of this line with the parabola $y^2 = 8x$. We are looking for the intersection point with a positive y-coordinate.\nSubstitute the expression for $y$ from the line equation into the parabola equation:\n$(\\sqrt{3}(x-2))^2 = 8x$\n$3(x-2)^2 = 8x$\n$3(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 8x$\n$3x^2 - 12x + 12 = 8x$\n$3x^2 - 20x + 12 = 0$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $x$ using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$x = \\frac{-(-20) \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4(3)(12)}}{2(3)}$\n$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 144}}{6}$\n$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{256}}{6}$\nSince $\\sqrt{256} = 16$, we have:\n$x = \\frac{20 \\pm 16}{6}$\n\nThis gives two possible values for $x$:\n$x_1 = \\frac{20+16}{6} = \\frac{36}{6} = 6$\n$x_2 = \\frac{20-16}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nWe find the corresponding y-coordinates using the line equation $y = \\sqrt{3}(x-2)$:\nFor $x_1=6$: $y_1 = \\sqrt{3}(6-2) = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\nFor $x_2=2/3$: $y_2 = \\sqrt{3}(\\frac{2}{3}-2) = \\sqrt{3}(-\\frac{4}{3}) = -\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the point of incidence $P$ has a positive y-coordinate ($y_0 > 0$). Therefore, we choose the first solution. The point of incidence is $P(6, 4\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the path of the reflected ray.**\nThe incident ray originates from the focus of the parabola. A fundamental reflective property of a parabola is that any ray emitted from the focus will reflect off the parabolic surface into a ray traveling parallel to the parabola's axis of symmetry.\nIn this case, the axis of symmetry is the x-axis ($y=0$). Therefore, the reflected ray must be a horizontal line.\n\nThe reflected ray passes through the point of incidence $P(6, 4\\sqrt{3})$. Since the ray is a horizontal line passing through this point, its equation must be:\n$y = 4\\sqrt{3}$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of the reflected ray with the directrix.**\nThe reflected ray is the line $y = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe directrix of the parabola is the line $x = -2$.\n\nTo find the point of intersection, we see that the coordinates must satisfy both equations. The intersection point is therefore $(-2, 4\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Step 5: State the final answer.**\nThe problem asks for the y-coordinate of the point where the reflected ray intersects the directrix.
