In the Cartesian plane, the curve of the cross-section is described by the general form of a quadratic equation:\n$$2x^2 - 12x - y + 18 = 0$$\nTo analyze its geometric properties, such as the location of the vertex and focus, the equation must be converted to its standard form, $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.

This process involves completing the square for the variable that is squared, which is $x$ in this case.\n\nFirst, we rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving $x$ on one side and the terms involving $y$ and the constant on the other side.\n$$2x^2 - 12x = y - 18$$\n\nTo complete the square, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term must be 1. We factor out the coefficient, which is 2, from the terms on the left side of the equation.\n$$2(x^2 - 6x) = y - 18$$\n\nNext, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses, $x^2 - 6x$. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term, square it, and add it inside the parentheses. The coefficient of the $x$ term is $-6$.\nHalf of the coefficient is $\\frac{-6}{2} = -3$.\nSquaring this value gives $(-3)^2 = 9$.\n\nWe add this value, 9, inside the parentheses on the left side. However, because the entire expression in parentheses is multiplied by 2, the value we have effectively added to the left side of the equation is $2 \\times 9 = 18$. To maintain the equality, we must also add 18 to the right side of the equation.\n$$2(x^2 - 6x + 9) = y - 18 + 18$$\n\nNow, the expression in the parentheses on the left side is a perfect square trinomial, $(x-3)^2$. The right side simplifies as well.\n$$2(x-3)^2 = y$$\n\nThe final step is to arrange this equation into the standard form $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$. To do this, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate the squared term.\n$$(x-3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}y$$\n\nTo match the target form precisely, we can write the right side to explicitly show the $k$ term.\n$$(x-3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(y - 0)$$\n\nBy comparing this equation, $(x-3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(y-0)$, with the standard form $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$, we can identify the values of the parameters $h$, $k$, and $p$.\n- Comparing $(x-3)^2$ with $(x-h)^2$, we find that $h = 3$.\n- Comparing $(y-0)$ with $(y-k)$, we find that $k = 0$.\n- Comparing the coefficients of the $(y-k)$ term, we have $4p = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSolving for $p$, we get:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n\nThus, the parameters for the standard form of the parabola are $h=3$, $k=0$, and $p=\\frac{1}{8}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 & \\frac{1}{8} \\end{pmatrix}}$$"}, {"introduction": "The true power of analytic geometry lies in its ability to connect algebraic equations to geometric properties.
