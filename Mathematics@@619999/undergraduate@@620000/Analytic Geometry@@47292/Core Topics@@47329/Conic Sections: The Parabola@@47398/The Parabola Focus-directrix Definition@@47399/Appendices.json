This practice challenges you to take a general quadratic equation and, through the powerful technique of completing the square, transform it into the standard vertex form. Mastering this process is crucial as it allows you to decode the equation's \"geometric DNA\"—revealing the precise locations of the vertex, focus, and directrix, which are essential for applications like the spacecraft trajectory described in the problem [@problem_id:2169582].", "problem": "In a simplified two-dimensional model used for planning a spacecraft's gravitational assist maneuver, the trajectory of a probe relative to a planet is described by a parabola. For this model to be effective, the planet must be precisely located at the focus of this parabolic path. Furthermore, a critical safety protocol requires that the probe's path does not intersect a linear \"forbidden zone\" boundary, which corresponds to the directrix of the parabola.\n\nAn orbital mechanics team has determined that a particular probe's trajectory in a specific Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$ is governed by the equation:\n$$y^2 + 8x - 6y + 25 = 0$$\nThe units of distance in this coordinate system are in millions of kilometers.\n\nTo finalize the mission plan, you must determine the key parameters of this trajectory. The coordinates of the planet (focus) are denoted by $(x_f, y_f)$, and the linear boundary of the forbidden zone (directrix) is a vertical line with the equation $x = d$. Determine the numerical values of $x_f$, $y_f$, and $d$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the coordinates of the focus $(x_f, y_f)$ and the equation of the directrix $x=d$ for the parabola described by the given equation. To do this, we must first convert the given equation into the standard form of a parabola.\n\nThe given equation is:\n$$y^2 + 8x - 6y + 25 = 0$$\n\nSince the equation contains a $y^2$ term and a linear $x$ term, we know it represents a parabola that opens either to the left or to the right. The standard form for such a parabola is $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex and $p$ is the directed distance from the vertex to the focus.\n\nOur first step is to rearrange the given equation by grouping the terms involving $y$ on one side and moving the terms involving $x$ and the constant to the other side.\n$$y^2 - 6y = -8x - 25$$\n\nNext, we complete the square for the terms on the left side. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of the $y$ term, which is $-6$, and square it. Half of $-6$ is $-3$, and $(-3)^2 = 9$. We add this value to both sides of the equation to maintain equality.\n$$(y^2 - 6y + 9) = -8x - 25 + 9$$\n\nNow, we can factor the left side, which is a perfect square trinomial, and simplify the right side.\n$$(y - 3)^2 = -8x - 16$$\n\nTo match the standard form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, we need to factor out the coefficient of $x$ on the right-hand side. The coefficient of $x$ is $-8$.\n$$(y - 3)^2 = -8(x + 2)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$(y - 3)^2 = -8(x - (-2))$$\n\nBy comparing this equation with the standard form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, we can identify the parameters of the parabola:\n- The vertex is $(h,k) = (-2, 3)$.\n- The focal length parameter is given by $4p = -8$, which implies $p = -2$.\n\nSince the parabola is of the form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, its axis of symmetry is horizontal. Because $p = -2$ is negative, the parabola opens to the left.\n\nThe focus of a horizontal parabola is located at a distance of $|p|$ from the vertex along the axis of symmetry. The coordinates of the focus are given by $(h+p, k)$.\nSubstituting the values of $h$, $k$, and $p$:\nFocus $(x_f, y_f) = (-2 + (-2), 3) = (-4, 3)$.\nTherefore, we have $x_f = -4$ and $y_f = 3$.\n\nThe directrix of a horizontal parabola is a vertical line given by the equation $x = h - p$.\nSubstituting the values of $h$ and $p$:\nDirectrix equation: $x = -2 - (-2) = -2 + 2 = 0$.\nSo, the equation of the directrix is $x = 0$.\n\nThe problem states that the directrix equation is of the form $x=d$. By comparing this with our result, we find that $d=0$.\n\nThus, the required values are $x_f = -4$, $y_f = 3$, and $d = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -4  3  0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2169582"}, {"introduction": "This next practice reverses the process. Instead of deconstructing an equation, you will build one from a set of geometric design specifications—the vertex and the focus. This exercise demonstrates how to translate an intended shape into a precise mathematical formula and then use that formula to solve a practical problem involving the intersection of components, as seen in the design of a parabolic antenna [@problem_id:2169548].", "problem": "An engineer is designing a parabolic antenna. The cross-section of the antenna's dish is described by a parabola in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.

There are two points where the strut intersects the parabolic dish. Determine the coordinates $(x_p, y_p)$ of the intersection point that has the greater y-coordinate. Your final answer should be a pair of numbers representing the coordinates $(x_p, y_p)$.", "solution": "The solution involves three main steps: first, determining the equation of the parabola from its vertex and focus; second, solving for the intersection points of the parabola and the given line; and third, identifying the correct point based on the problem's condition.\n\nFirst, we determine the equation of the parabola.\nThe vertex is given as $V(h, k) = (2, -3)$ and the focus is $F(-1, -3)$. Since the y-coordinates of the vertex and focus are the same ($y=-3$), the parabola's axis of symmetry is the horizontal line $y = -3$. This means the parabola opens either to the left or to the right, and its standard equation is $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$.\n\nThe parameter $p$ is the directed distance from the vertex to the focus. It can be calculated as the difference in the x-coordinates of the focus and the vertex:\n$$p = x_{\\text{focus}} - x_{\\text{vertex}} = -1 - 2 = -3$$\nSince $p$ is negative, the parabola opens to the left.\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the parabola by substituting the values of $h$, $k$, and $p$:\n$$h = 2, \\quad k = -3, \\quad p = -3$$\nThe equation is:\n$$(y - (-3))^2 = 4(-3)(x - 2)$$\n$$(y+3)^2 = -12(x-2)$$\n\nNext, we find the intersection points of this parabola with the line representing the support strut, which is given by the equation $y = x - 6$. To solve the system of equations, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ from the line's equation:\n$$x = y + 6$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $x$ into the parabola's equation:\n$$(y+3)^2 = -12((y+6) - 2)$$\n$$(y+3)^2 = -12(y+4)$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $y$. Expand both sides:\n$$y^2 + 6y + 9 = -12y - 48$$\nMove all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation of the form $ay^2 + by + c = 0$:\n$$y^2 + 6y + 12y + 9 + 48 = 0$$\n$$y^2 + 18y + 57 = 0$$\n\nWe use the quadratic formula to find the values of $y$:\n$$y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nFor our equation, $a=1$, $b=18$, and $c=57$.\n$$y = \\frac{-18 \\pm \\sqrt{18^2 - 4(1)(57)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$y = \\frac{-18 \\pm \\sqrt{324 - 228}}{2}$$\n$$y = \\frac{-18 \\pm \\sqrt{96}}{2}$$\nTo simplify the square root, we find the largest perfect square factor of 96, which is 16: $\\sqrt{96} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 6} = 4\\sqrt{6}$.\n$$y = \\frac{-18 \\pm 4\\sqrt{6}}{2}$$\n$$y = -9 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}$$\nThe two possible y-coordinates for the intersection points are $y_1 = -9 + 2\\sqrt{6}$ and $y_2 = -9 - 2\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the intersection point with the greater y-coordinate.
