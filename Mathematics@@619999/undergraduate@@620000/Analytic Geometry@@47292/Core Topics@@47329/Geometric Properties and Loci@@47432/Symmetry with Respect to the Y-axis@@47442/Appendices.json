We apply this test to each option.\n\nFor A, the equation is $y = x^{3} - 3x$. Substituting $-x$ for $x$ gives\n$$y = (-x)^{3} - 3(-x) = -x^{3} + 3x = -(x^{3} - 3x).$$\nThis is not equivalent to the original equation for all $(x,y)$, so A is not symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nFor B, the equation is $|x| - y^{2} = 1$. Substituting $-x$ for $x$ gives\n$$|-x| - y^{2} = 1.$$\nSince $|-x| = |x|$, this is identical to the original equation.

The graph of $g(x)$ possesses no line or point symmetry.", "solution": "The problem provides information about the symmetry of a function $f(x)$ and asks for the symmetry of a related, transformed function $g(x)$.\n\nStep 1: Understand the initial condition.\nThe statement that the graph of $y = f(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the y-axis is the definition of an even function. This means that for any value $a$ in the domain of $f$, the equality $f(-a) = f(a)$ holds.\n\nStep 2: Define the transformed function and the goal.\nThe new function is given by $g(x) = f(x - h)$, where $h$ is a non-zero constant. We need to determine the symmetry of the graph of $y = g(x)$. The answer choices suggest we should test for symmetry about the origin, the y-axis, and other vertical or horizontal lines.\n\nStep 3: Test for symmetry about a vertical line.\nA function $g(x)$ is symmetric with respect to a vertical line $x=c$ if $g(c+t) = g(c-t)$ for all values of $t$ for which $c+t$ and $c-t$ are in the domain of $g$. This means that any two points on the graph that are equidistant horizontally from the line $x=c$ must have the same y-coordinate.\n\nThe original function $f(x)$ was symmetric about the line $x=0$. The function $g(x) = f(x-h)$ represents a horizontal shift of the graph of $f(x)$ by $h$ units to the right (if $h>0$) or $|h|$ units to the left (if $h<0$). It is reasonable to hypothesize that the axis of symmetry is also shifted by $h$ units, from $x=0$ to $x=h$.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis by setting $c=h$. We need to verify if the equation $g(h+t) = g(h-t)$ is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the left side of the symmetry condition.\nWe substitute $x = h+t$ into the definition of $g(x)$:\n$$g(h+t) = f((h+t) - h) = f(t)$$\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the right side of the symmetry condition.\nWe substitute $x = h-t$ into the definition of $g(x)$:\n$$g(h-t) = f((h-t) - h) = f(-t)$$\n\nStep 6: Use the property of the original function $f(x)$.\nFrom Step 1, we know that $f(x)$ is an even function, so $f(t) = f(-t)$.\n\nStep 7: Conclude the symmetry of $g(x)$.\nBy combining the results from the previous steps, we have:\n$$g(h+t) = f(t)$$\n$$g(h-t) = f(-t)$$\nSince $f(t) = f(-t)$, it follows that $g(h+t) = g(h-t)$. This is the definition of symmetry about the vertical line $x=h$.\n\nStep 8: Evaluate the other options.\n-   The graph is not symmetric with respect to the y-axis (unless $h=0$, which is excluded), because $g(x)=f(x-h)$ is not generally equal to $g(-x)=f(-x-h)$.\n-   The graph is not symmetric with respect to the origin, because that would require $g(-x) = -g(x)$, which is not generally true.\n-   Symmetry about a horizontal line is not implied by the given transformation.\n-   To test for symmetry about the vertical line $x=-h$, we must check if $g(-h+t)=g(-h-t)$ for all $t$. Substituting the definition of $g(x)$, we get $f((-h+t)-h) = f((-h-t)-h)$, which simplifies to $f(t-2h) = f(-t-2h)$. Since $f$ is an even function, $f(-t-2h) = f(t+2h)$. So the condition for symmetry is $f(t-2h) = f(t+2h)$. This is not true for a general even function (e.g., if $f(x)=x^2$ with $h\\neq0$, this condition becomes $(t-2h)^2=(t+2h)^2$, which is only satisfied for $t=0$, not for all $t$). Therefore, the graph is not generally symmetric about $x=-h$.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement describing the symmetry of $g(x)$ is that its graph is symmetric with respect to the vertical line $x = h$.
