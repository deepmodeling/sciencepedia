This exercise challenges you to think like a designer by selecting an equation that fulfills a precise set of symmetry constraints: one that is symmetric about the x-axis but lacks symmetry about the y-axis and the origin.

A sufficient algebraic condition is that $y$ only appears with even powers, such as through $y^{2}$. For a graph given explicitly by $y=f(x)$, $x$-axis symmetry would require that both $y$ and $-y$ occur for the same $x$, which is impossible unless $f(x)=0$ for all $x$. Therefore, any nontrivial explicit function $y=f(x)$ cannot be symmetric about the $x$-axis.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- Option A: $y=x^{4}-2x^{2}+5$ is an explicit function $y=f(x)$ with nonzero values, so it is not symmetric about the $x$-axis.\n- Option B: $y=x^{5}-3x^{3}$ is also an explicit function $y=f(x)$ with nonzero values, so it is not symmetric about the $x$-axis.\n- Option E: $y=x^{3}-x^{2}$ is likewise an explicit function $y=f(x)$ with nonzero values, so it is not symmetric about the $x$-axis.\n\nThus, only options with $y$ appearing in even powers can satisfy $x$-axis symmetry:\n- Option C: $x^{4}+y^{2}=1$. Replacing $y$ by $-y$ yields $x^{4}+(-y)^{2}=1$, which is identical, so it is symmetric about the $x$-axis. Replacing $x$ by $-x$ yields $(-x)^{4}+y^{2}=1$, also identical, so it is symmetric about the $y$-axis as well (and consequently about the origin). This violates the requirement that the curve not be symmetric about the $y$-axis or the origin.\n- Option D: $y^{2}=x^{3}-4x+1$. Replacing $y$ by $-y$ yields $(-y)^{2}=x^{3}-4x+1$, which is the same equation, so it is symmetric about the $x$-axis. Replacing $x$ by $-x$ yields $y^{2}=(-x)^{3}-4(-x)+1=-x^{3}+4x+1$, which is not equivalent to $y^{2}=x^{3}-4x+1$, so it is not symmetric about the $y$-axis. Replacing $(x,y)$ by $(-x,-y)$ gives $(-y)^{2}=(-x)^{3}-4(-x)+1$, i.e., $y^{2}=-x^{3}+4x+1$, again not equivalent to the original equation, so it is not symmetric about the origin.\n\nTherefore, the only equation satisfying symmetry about the $x$-axis but not about the $y$-axis nor the origin is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2106547"}]}
