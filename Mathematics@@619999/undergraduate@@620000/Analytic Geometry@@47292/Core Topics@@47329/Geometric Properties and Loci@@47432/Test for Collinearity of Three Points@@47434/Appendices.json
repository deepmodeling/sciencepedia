This means it passes through at least three distinct points with integer coordinates. Let these points be $P_1(x_1, y_1)$, $P_2(x_2, y_2)$, and $P_3(x_3, y_3)$, where all $x_i, y_i$ are integers.\n\nFirst, we establish a general property of lines passing through points on the integer lattice. If a line passes through two distinct integer points, say $P_1(x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2, y_2)$, its slope $m$ is given by $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Since $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ are all integers, the slope $m$ must be a rational number (if $x_1 \\neq x_2$) or infinite (if $x_1 = x_2$, a vertical line). Any point on this line can be parameterized as $P(t) = (x_1 + t(x_2-x_1), y_1 + t(y_2-y_1))$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For any integer value of $t$, the coordinates of $P(t)$ are integers, meaning $P(t)$ is a lattice point. Thus, a line passing through two distinct lattice points actually passes through infinitely many. Consequently, the condition of being a \"lattice trichord\" (passing through at least three points) is equivalent to passing through at least two distinct lattice points.\n\nThe family of lines is given by $y = \\alpha x - \\alpha^2$. The slope of such a line is $m=\\alpha$. A vertical line has an infinite slope, which is not possible for any real $\\alpha$. Therefore, for $L_\\alpha$ to be a lattice trichord, its slope $\\alpha$ must be a rational number. Let $\\alpha = p/q$, where $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $q \\neq 0$. We can assume, without loss of generality, that $q > 0$ and $p, q$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$.\n\nIn addition to having a rational slope, the line must pass through at least one integer lattice point, say $(x_0, y_0)$. Substituting this point and $\\alpha=p/q$ into the line's equation gives:\n$$y_0 = \\frac{p}{q} x_0 - \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^2$$\nTo eliminate the denominators, we can multiply the entire equation by $q^2$:\n$$q^2 y_0 = pq x_0 - p^2$$\nRearranging this equation gives a linear Diophantine equation for the integer variables $x_0$ and $y_0$:\n$$pq x_0 - q^2 y_0 = p^2$$\nThis equation has an integer solution $(x_0, y_0)$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of the variables divides the constant term on the right-hand side. The coefficients are $pq$ and $-q^2$. Their greatest common divisor is:\n$$\\gcd(pq, -q^2) = \\gcd(pq, q^2)$$\nSince $q$ is a common factor, we can write:\n$$\\gcd(pq, q^2) = q \\cdot \\gcd(p, q)$$\nBy our initial assumption, $p$ and $q$ are coprime, so $\\gcd(p,q)=1$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of the coefficients is simply $q$.\n\nThe condition for the existence of an integer solution is that this gcd must divide $p^2$. That is:\n$$q \\mid p^2$$\nWe have two conditions on the integers $p$ and $q$: $\\gcd(p,q)=1$ and $q \\mid p^2$. If two integers are coprime, they share no prime factors. The prime factors of $p^2$ are the same as the prime factors of $p$. Since $q$ shares no prime factors with $p$, it can also share no prime factors with $p^2$. In other words, $\\gcd(q, p^2)=1$.\n\nFor an integer $q$ to divide an integer $k$ while also being coprime to $k$, it must be that $|q|=1$. Since we chose $q > 0$, we must have $q=1$.\n\nWith $q=1$, our rational number $\\alpha = p/q$ becomes $\\alpha = p/1 = p$, where $p$ is an integer. This shows that $\\alpha$ must be an integer.\n\nTo complete the argument, we must check if this condition is sufficient. Suppose $\\alpha$ is an integer, say $\\alpha = n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The line's equation becomes $y = nx - n^2$.\nThe slope $n$ is a rational number. We need to check if the line passes through at least one lattice point. Let's test the integer coordinates $(x,y)=(n,0)$:\n$$0 = n(n) - n^2$$\n$$0 = n^2 - n^2$$\nThis is true, so the line $y=nx-n^2$ passes through the lattice point $(n,0)$.\nSince the line has a rational slope and passes through at least one lattice point, it must pass through infinitely many, and therefore at least three. For instance, for any integer $k$, the point $(n+k, n(n+k)-n^2) = (n+k, nk)$ is a lattice point on the line. Setting $k=0, 1, 2$ gives three distinct lattice points: $(n,0)$, $(n+1, n)$, and $(n+2, 2n)$.\n\nThus, the line $L_\\alpha$ is a lattice trichord if and only if $\\alpha$ is an integer.
