Let triangle $T_{1}$ be the medial triangle of $T_{2}$, with vertices at the midpoints of the sides of $T_{2}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the relationship between the orthocenter of $T_{1}$ and centers of $T_{2}$. Each side of $T_{1}$ is parallel to the corresponding side of $T_{2}$; for example, the side of $T_{1}$ opposite the midpoint of $BC$ is parallel to $BC$. Therefore, the altitude of $T_{1}$ from the midpoint of $BC$ is perpendicular to the side parallel to $BC$, hence perpendicular to $BC$ itself; since it passes through the midpoint of $BC$, it is the perpendicular bisector of $BC$. By the same reasoning, the three altitudes of $T_{1}$ coincide with the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of $T_{2}$. Hence, the orthocenter of $T_{1}$ is the circumcenter of $T_{2}$.\n\nThus, it suffices to compute the circumcenter $O$ of $T_{2}$.
