Test for Symmetry with Respect to the x-axis**\n\nA curve is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if for every point $(x, y)$ on the curve, the point $(x, -y)$ is also on the curve. In terms of parametric equations, this means that for any parameter $t_1$, there must exist a parameter $t_2$ such that $x(t_2) = x(t_1)$ and $y(t_2) = -y(t_1)$.\n\nLet's investigate the effect of replacing $t$ with $-t$.\nFor the x-coordinate:\n$$x(-t) = (-t)^2 - 1 = t^2 - 1 = x(t)$$\nFor the y-coordinate:\n$$y(-t) = (-t)^3 - (-t) = -t^3 + t = -(t^3 - t) = -y(t)$$\nSince for any parameter $t$, we can choose $-t$ as our second parameter, we see that the point $(x(-t), y(-t))$ is equal to $(x(t), -y(t))$. This means that if a point $(x, y)$ is on the curve (generated by parameter $t$), the point $(x, -y)$ is also on the curve (generated by parameter $-t$). Therefore, the curve is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\n**2. Test for Symmetry with Respect to the y-axis**\n\nA curve is symmetric with respect to the y-axis if for every point $(x, y)$ on the curve, the point $(-x, y)$ is also on the curve. This means that for any parameter $t_1$, there must exist a parameter $t_2$ such that $x(t_2) = -x(t_1)$ and $y(t_2) = y(t_1)$.\n\nLet's use a counterexample to test this. Consider the point generated by $t_1 = 2$.\n$x(2) = 2^2 - 1 = 3$\n$y(2) = 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6$\nSo, the point $(3, 6)$ is on the curve.

Therefore, the point $(-3, 6)$ is not on the curve. Since we found a point $(x,y)$ on the curve for which $(-x,y)$ is not, the curve is not symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\n**3.

For origin symmetry, the point $(-3, -6)$ must be on the curve. We need to find if there exists a parameter $t$ such that $x(t) = -3$ and $y(t) = -6$.\nAgain, we check the x-equation:\n$$x(t) = t^2 - 1 = -3$$\n$$t^2 = -2$$\nAs before, there is no real number $t$ that satisfies this equation. Therefore, the point $(-3,-6)$ is not on the curve.
