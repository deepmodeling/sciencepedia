Two key landmarks are the City Hall, located at point $A = (-15, 30)$, and the Central Library, located at point $B = (43, -18)$. A perfectly straight underground utility tunnel is to be built connecting these two landmarks.\n\nA primary north-south service line must be constructed. This service line is represented on the map as a vertical line. According to the city's master plan, this vertical service line must pass through the exact midpoint of the utility tunnel segment connecting the City Hall and the Central Library. The equation of any vertical line can be written in the form $x = c$, where $c$ is a constant. Determine the value of the constant $c$ for this specific service line.", "solution": "Let $A=(-15,30)$ and $B=(43,-18)$.

You are asked to find the orthocenter, a task that is greatly simplified by recognizing the right angle formed by the intersection of a vertical and a horizontal line.

An altitude is a line segment that passes through a vertex of the triangle and is perpendicular to the side opposite that vertex.\n\nDetermine the coordinates of the orthocenter of the triangle formed by these three lines.", "solution": "We first find the vertices of the triangle by intersecting the given lines. Let the lines be $L_{1}: x=4$, $L_{2}: y=-2$, and $L_{3}: y=x-1$.\n- Vertex $A$ is the intersection of $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$: solving $x=4$ and $y=-2$ gives $A=(4,-2)$.\n- Vertex $B$ is the intersection of $L_{1}$ and $L_{3}$: solving $x=4$ and $y=x-1$ gives $y=3$, so $B=(4,3)$.\n- Vertex $C$ is the intersection of $L_{2}$ and $L_{3}$: solving $y=-2$ and $y=x-1$ gives $-2=x-1$, hence $x=-1$, so $C=(-1,-2)$.\n\nThe sides through $A$ are $AB$ given by $x=4$ (vertical) and $AC$ given by $y=-2$ (horizontal). Since a vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line, the angle at $A$ is a right angle. In a right triangle, the orthocenter is at the right-angled vertex because the altitude from each of the other two vertices coincides with the corresponding leg:\n- The altitude from $B$ to side $AC$ is the line perpendicular to $AC: y=-2$, hence the vertical line through $B$, which is $x=4$.\n- The altitude from $C$ to side $AB$ is the line perpendicular to $AB: x=4$, hence the horizontal line through $C$, which is $y=-2$.\n\nThese two altitudes intersect at the solution of $x=4$ and $y=-2$, namely at $A=(4,-2)$.
