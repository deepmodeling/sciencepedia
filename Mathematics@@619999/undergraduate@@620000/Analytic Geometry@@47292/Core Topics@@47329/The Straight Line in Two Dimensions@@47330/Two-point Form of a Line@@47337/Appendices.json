Our goal is to find the value of $c$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope $m$ of the line passing through the points $A = (x_A, y_A)$ and $B = (x_B, y_B)$. The formula for the slope is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A}\n$$\nSince the problem states that $x_A \\neq x_B$, the denominator is non-zero, and the slope is well-defined.\n\nNext, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation.
