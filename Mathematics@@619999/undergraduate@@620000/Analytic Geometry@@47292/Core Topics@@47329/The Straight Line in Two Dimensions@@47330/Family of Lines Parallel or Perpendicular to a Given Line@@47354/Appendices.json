According to the city's grid plan, the path of this conduit must be parallel to an existing main sewer line, which is represented on the map by the equation $3x - 4y + 15 = 0$. A critical design constraint is that the new conduit must be positioned such that it is exactly equidistant from two sensitive environmental monitoring stations. The locations of these stations on the map are given by the coordinates $P_1 = (1, 5)$ and $P_2 = (7, -1)$. The equation for the path of the new utility conduit can be expressed in the form $3x - 4y + C = 0$.
