This problem uses the practical scenario of a theatrical spotlight to guide you in deriving the equation for a cone, which forms the boundary of a shadow [@problem_id:2128431]. Instead of a direct conversion, you will use geometric reasoning to model a physical situation, illustrating how cylindrical coordinates naturally capture the radial and vertical properties of axisymmetric objects.", "problem": "A simplified model for a theatrical spotlight system involves a point light source located at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. An opaque circular disk of radius $R_0$ is centered on the z-axis and placed in the plane $z=H$, where $H > 0$. The spotlight is aimed along the positive z-axis, and the disk casts a shadow for all locations with a z-coordinate greater than $H$. The boundary of this shadow is a surface formed by light rays that emanate from the origin and are tangent to the perimeter of the disk.
