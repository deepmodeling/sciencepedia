Mathematically, this is $A_2 = 2A_0$.\nSubstituting the expressions for the areas, we get:\n$$ \\pi ab \\left(1 + \\frac{4}{c^2}\\right) = 2(\\pi ab) $$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are non-zero, we can divide both sides by $\\pi ab$:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{4}{c^2} = 2 $$\nNow, we solve for $c^2$:\n$$ \\frac{4}{c^2} = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\n$$ c^2 = 4 $$\n\nWe have now determined all the parameters of the hyperboloid equation: $a^2=4$, $b^2=9$, and $c^2=4$.
