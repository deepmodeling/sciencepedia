Instead of a fixed cutting plane, you will consider a family of planes rotating around an axis, and explore their intersection with a hyperboloid. Your goal is to move beyond simply identifying the cross-section and instead analyze one of its deeper geometric properties: the orthogonality of its asymptotes. This problem requires you to connect the algebraic parameter of the cutting plane to a sophisticated geometric feature of the resulting curve, integrating concepts from algebra, 3D geometry, and vector analysis [@problem_id:2106762].", "problem": "Consider the quadric surface defined by the equation $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{3} - \\frac{z^2}{2} = 1$, which represents a hyperboloid of one sheet. This surface is intersected by a family of planes that pass through the $y$-axis, described by the equation $z = mx$, where $m$ is a real constant. For certain values of the parameter $m$, the curve of intersection is a hyperbola. Your task is to find the positive value of $m$ for which the two asymptotes of this resulting hyperbolic cross-section are orthogonal to each other.", "solution": "The problem asks for the specific positive value of the parameter $m$ for a family of planes $z=mx$ such that the intersection with the hyperboloid $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{3} - \\frac{z^2}{2} = 1$ is a hyperbola whose asymptotes are orthogonal.\n\nStep 1: Find the equation of the intersection curve.\nWe substitute the equation of the plane, $z=mx$, into the equation of the hyperboloid:\n$$x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{3} - \\frac{(mx)^2}{2} = 1$$\nWe can group the terms involving $x$:\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{m^2}{2}\\right)x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{3} = 1$$\n\nStep 2: Determine the condition for the intersection to be a hyperbola.\nThe equation is of the form $Ax^2 + By^2 = 1$. For this to represent a hyperbola, the coefficients $A$ and $B$ must have opposite signs. Here, $B = 1/3$ is positive, so we require $A$ to be negative.\n$$A = 1 - \\frac{m^2}{2} < 0$$\n$$\\frac{m^2}{2} > 1$$\n$$m^2 > 2$$\nThis implies $|m| > \\sqrt{2}$.

The direction vector is:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\left\\langle 1, \\sqrt{\\frac{3(m^2-2)}{2}}, m \\right\\rangle$$\nFor the second asymptote, setting $x=1$ gives $y=-\\sqrt{\\frac{3(m^2-2)}{2}}$ and $z=m$. The direction vector is:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\left\\langle 1, -\\sqrt{\\frac{3(m^2-2)}{2}}, m \\right\\rangle$$\n\nStep 6: Apply the orthogonality condition.\nTwo lines are orthogonal if the dot product of their direction vectors is zero.\n$$\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 = 0$$\n$$(1)(1) + \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3(m^2-2)}{2}}\\right)\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3(m^2-2)}{2}}\\right) + (m)(m) = 0$$\n$$1 - \\frac{3(m^2-2)}{2} + m^2 = 0$$\n\nStep 7: Solve for $m$.\nNow we solve the algebraic equation for $m$. Multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear the fraction:\n$$2 - 3(m^2-2) + 2m^2 = 0$$\n$$2 - 3m^2 + 6 + 2m^2 = 0$$\n$$8 - m^2 = 0$$\n$$m^2 = 8$$\nThis gives two possible values for $m$: $m = \\sqrt{8}$ and $m = -\\sqrt{8}$.\nThe problem asks for the positive value of $m$.\n$$m = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$$\nWe must check if this solution satisfies the condition $|m| > \\sqrt{2}$.
