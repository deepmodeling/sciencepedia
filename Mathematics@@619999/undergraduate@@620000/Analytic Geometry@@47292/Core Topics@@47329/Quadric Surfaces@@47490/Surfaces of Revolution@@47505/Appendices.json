The shape of the vase is generated by revolving a curve around the vertical $z$-axis. In the $xz$-plane, for non-negative values of $x$, the profile of the vase is described by the equation $z = a x^4$. Here, $z$ represents the vertical height from the base of the vase, and $x$ is the horizontal distance from the central $z$-axis. The parameter $a$ is a positive constant that determines the flare of the vase. The top rim of the vase is a circle at a fixed height $H$ from the base. Find a symbolic expression for the radius of this top circular rim in terms of the parameters $a$ and $H$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the radius of the circular opening of a vase at a specific height $H$. The vase's shape is a surface of revolution generated by rotating the curve $z = ax^4$ (for $x \\ge 0$) around the $z$-axis.\n\nLet's first determine the general equation of this surface of revolution. A point $(X, Y, Z)$ lies on the surface if it is generated by rotating a point $(x, 0, z)$ from the profile curve in the $xz$-plane. The rotation occurs in a plane of constant height, so $Z = z$. The distance of the point $(X, Y, Z)$ from the $z$-axis is given by the radius $r = \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$. This radius must be equal to the $x$-coordinate of the original point on the profile curve, so $r=x$. Since the problem specifies $x \\ge 0$, we have $x = \\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}$.\n\nThe profile curve is defined by the relationship $z = ax^4$. To find the equation of the surface, we substitute $z=Z$ and $x = \\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}$ into the profile equation.\n$$Z = a \\left(\\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}\\right)^4$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$Z = a (X^2+Y^2)^2$$\nThis is the implicit equation for the surface of the vase. The coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ of any point on the vase must satisfy this equation.\n\nWe are asked to find the radius of the vase's rim at a constant height $H$. This corresponds to finding the properties of the cross-section of the vase in the plane $Z=H$. We substitute $Z=H$ into the surface equation:\n$$H = a (X^2+Y^2)^2$$\nThe term $X^2+Y^2$ represents the square of the distance from the $z$-axis for points on this cross-section. Let's denote the radius of this circular cross-section as $R$. By definition, $R^2 = X^2+Y^2$. Substituting this into our equation gives:\n$$H = a (R^2)^2$$\n$$H = a R^4$$\nOur goal is to solve for the radius $R$ in terms of $H$ and $a$. We can rearrange the equation to isolate $R^4$:\n$$R^4 = \\frac{H}{a}$$\nTo find $R$, we take the fourth root of both sides. Since radius must be a positive quantity, we only consider the real positive root:\n$$R = \\left(\\frac{H}{a}\\right)^{1/4}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the radius of the vase's top rim.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{H}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}}$$", "id": "2160187"}, {"introduction": "Once you can generate a surface, the next logical step is to determine which points in space belong to it.
