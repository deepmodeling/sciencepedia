This equation represents a degenerate conic section. Determine the coordinates $(h, k)$ of the center of this conic.", "solution": "The problem asks for the center of the conic section defined by the equation $3x^2 + 2y^2 + 6x - 16y + 35 = 0$. To find the center, we need to rewrite this equation in a standard form by completing the square for both the $x$ and $y$ variables.\n\nThe given equation is:\n$$3x^2 + 2y^2 + 6x - 16y + 35 = 0$$\n\nFirst, we group the terms involving $x$ and the terms involving $y$:\n$$(3x^2 + 6x) + (2y^2 - 16y) + 35 = 0$$\n\nNext, we factor out the coefficients of the squared terms from each group:\n$$3(x^2 + 2x) + 2(y^2 - 8y) + 35 = 0$$\n\nNow, we complete the square for the expression inside each parenthesis.\nFor the $x$ terms, $x^2 + 2x$, we take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term, which is $\\frac{2}{2} = 1$, and square it, which gives $1^2 = 1$. We add and subtract this value inside the first parenthesis, but we must be careful with the factor of 3 outside. More simply, we add $1$ inside the first parenthesis and balance the equation.\n$$3(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 2(y^2 - 8y) + 35 = 3(1)$$\n\nFor the $y$ terms, $y^2 - 8y$, we take half of the coefficient of the $y$ term, which is $\\frac{-8}{2} = -4$, and square it, which gives $(-4)^2 = 16$. We add this inside the second parenthesis and balance the equation.\n$$3(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 2(y^2 - 8y + 16) + 35 = 3(1) + 2(16)$$\n\nNow, we can write the completed squares as squared binomials:\n$$3(x+1)^2 + 2(y-4)^2 + 35 = 3 + 32$$\n$$3(x+1)^2 + 2(y-4)^2 + 35 = 35$$\n\nSubtracting 35 from both sides, we get the standard form of the equation:\n$$3(x+1)^2 + 2(y-4)^2 = 0$$\n\nThis equation has the form $A(x-h)^2 + B(y-k)^2 = C$. In a typical ellipse, $A$, $B$, and $C$ would all be positive. Here, $C=0$.\nThe terms $3(x+1)^2$ and $2(y-4)^2$ are both non-negative for any real numbers $x$ and $y$, since they are squares multiplied by positive coefficients. The sum of two non-negative terms can be zero if and only if both terms are individually equal to zero.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$3(x+1)^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2(y-4)^2 = 0$$\nThis leads to:\n$$(x+1)^2 = 0 \\implies x+1 = 0 \\implies x = -1$$\n$$(y-4)^2 = 0 \\implies y-4 = 0 \\implies y = 4$$\n\nThe only point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the given equation is $(-1, 4)$. This means the conic section degenerates to a single point.\nThe center of this degenerate conic (the point) is the point itself.\nThus, the coordinates of the center $(h, k)$ are $(-1, 4)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2111667"}, {"introduction": "Not all conics are perfectly aligned with the coordinate axes.
