First, the circle is tangent to the horizontal x-axis at the point with coordinates $(4,0)$. Second, the center of this circle lies on the line described by the equation $y = x$. Based on these conditions, determine the exact area of the circle.", "solution": "Let the circle have center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$.\n\n- Tangency to the $x$-axis at $(4,0)$ implies the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the $x$-axis. Therefore, that radius is vertical and has the same $x$-coordinate as the center. Hence the point of tangency must be $(h,0)$, so\n$$\nh=4.\n$$\n- The distance from the center to the $x$-axis equals the radius for tangency. The perpendicular distance from $(h,k)$ to the line $y=0$ is $|k|$, therefore\n$$\nr=|k|.\n$$\n- The center lies on the line $y=x$, so\n$$\nk=h.\n$$\nCombining with $h=4$ gives\n$$\nk=4.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nr=|k|=4.\n$$\n\nThe area of the circle is\n$$\nA=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi\\cdot 4^{2}=16\\pi.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16\\pi}$$", "id": "2109905"}, {"introduction": "Conic sections are often encountered in forms that are not immediately recognizable.
