Its trajectory is a perfect circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin $(0,0)$. At a specific moment, a transient, uniform electric field is applied, delivering an impulse that causes the particle to instantaneously shift to a new trajectory. This new path is a straight line segment that forms a chord of the original circular trajectory. An observation system determines that the midpoint of this chordal path lies on a line passing through the origin, and the distance of this midpoint from the origin is precisely $d$, where $d < R$.\n\nDetermine the total length of this chordal path.
