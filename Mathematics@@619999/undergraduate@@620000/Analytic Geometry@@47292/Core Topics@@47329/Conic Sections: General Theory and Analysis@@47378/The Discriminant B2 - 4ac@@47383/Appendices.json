While non-degenerate curves of this type are parabolas, they can also degenerate into a pair of parallel lines, a single line (coincident lines), or have no real locus at all.\n\nFor the equation to represent a pair of *distinct, real, parallel lines*, two specific constraints on the coefficients must be met. The first is an algebraic identity that ensures the conic is degenerate, and the second is an inequality that ensures the lines are both real and distinct.\n\nConsider the specific equation:\n$$9x^2 - 6xy + y^2 + dx + 10y + f = 0$$\nwhere $d$ and $f$ are real constants.

Since $B^2 - 4AC = 0$, the quadratic part $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2$ can be written as a perfect square.\n$9x^2 - 6xy + y^2 = (3x - y)^2$.\n\nOur full equation can therefore be written as:\n$$(3x - y)^2 + dx + 10y + f = 0$$\n\nFor this equation to be reducible to a quadratic in the variable $(3x - y)$, the linear part $dx + 10y$ must be proportional to $(3x - y)$. Let the constant of proportionality be $k$.\n$$dx + 10y = k(3x - y) = 3kx - ky$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ on both sides of this identity, we get a system of two equations:\n1. $d = 3k$\n2. $10 = -k$\n\nFrom the second equation, we find $k = -10$.\nSubstituting this value into the first equation gives the value of $d$:\n$d = 3(-10) = -30$.\nThis is the first required value. The condition for degeneracy in this form is that such a $k$ exists, which forced $d$ to be $-30$.\n\nNow that we have the value of $d$, we can substitute it and the proportionality relation back into the main conic equation:\n$$(3x - y)^2 - 10(3x - y) + f = 0$$\nTo simplify, let $u = 3x - y$. The equation becomes a standard quadratic equation in the variable $u$:\n$$u^2 - 10u + f = 0$$\nThe solutions for $u$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$u = \\frac{-(-10) \\pm \\sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4(1)(f)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 4f}}{2}$$\nThese solutions correspond to the two parallel lines $3x - y = u_1$ and $3x - y = u_2$.\nThe problem states that the lines must be *distinct* and *real*. This requires the term under the square root in the quadratic formula (the discriminant) to be strictly positive.\n$$100 - 4f > 0$$\nNow, we solve this inequality for $f$:\n$$100 > 4f$$\n$$25 > f$$\nThis can be written as $f < 25$.\nThis is the constraint on the coefficient $f$.
