To describe this curve in two dimensions, we define a new coordinate system $(x', y')$ that lies within the plane. The new $y'$ coordinate is simply the original $y$ coordinate, i.e., $y' = y$. The new $x'$ coordinate measures the distance along the line of intersection between the cutting plane and the $xz$-plane, with $x'=0$ corresponding to the point where this line crosses the $yz$-plane (i.e., at $x=0, z=c$).
