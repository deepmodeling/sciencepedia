Then $2=6k$, so $k=\\frac{1}{3}$. Substituting into $2x=k(4x-4)$ gives $2x=\\frac{1}{3}(4x-4)$, hence $6x=4x-4$ and $2x=-4$, so $x=-2$. This contradicts $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ since $x^{2}=4>1$. Therefore $y\\neq 0$ is impossible.\n\nCase 2: $y=0$. Then from $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ we have $x=\\pm 1$. The proportionality condition reduces to $2x=k(4x-4)$.\n- If $x=1$, then $2=k\\cdot 0$, which is impossible. Moreover, $S_{2}(1,0)=2-4-c=-2-c$ would require $c=-2$ for the ellipse to pass through $(1,0)$, which is the degenerate case $2(x-1)^{2}+3y^{2}=0$. This is excluded by the non-degeneracy requirement.\n- If $x=-1$, then $S_{2}(-1,0)=2(1)+0-4(-1)-c=6-c$. Imposing $S_{2}=0$ at the tangency point gives $6-c=0$, hence $c=6$. At $(-1,0)$, the gradients are $\\nabla S_{1}=(-2,0)$ and $\\nabla S_{2}=(-8,0)$, which are proportional, so the curves have the same tangent line there.\n\nFinally, confirm that $c=6$ yields exactly one real intersection point. For general $c$, subtract $2S_{1}$ from $S_{2}$:\n$$S_{2}-2S_{1}:\\quad (2x^{2}+3y^{2}-4x-c)-2(x^{2}+y^{2}-1)=y^{2}-4x-c+2=0.$$\nFor $c=6$, this gives $y^{2}=4x+4$. Together with $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$,\n$$x^{2}+4x+4=1 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x^{2}+4x+3=0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x=-1 \\text{ or } x=-3.$$\nThe choice $x=-3$ is invalid since $y^{2}=1-x^{2}<0$. Thus the only real intersection is at $(-1,0)$, and the common tangent there confirms tangency. Since $c=-2$ is excluded by non-degeneracy, the required value is $c=6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2127138"}]}
