The core of the device is a reflector with an elliptical cross-section. The operational principle relies on a key geometric property of the ellipse: any wave originating from a special point within the ellipse (a focus) will reflect off the elliptical surface and converge at a second special point (the other focus). In this design, the shock wave generator is placed at one focus, and the patient is positioned such that the kidney stone is located at the other focus.\n\nThe equation for the boundary of the elliptical reflector's cross-section is given by $x^2 + 5y^2 = 20$, where all coordinates are measured in centimeters.

The problem description states that these correspond to the two foci of the elliptical reflector. Therefore, our task is to find the distance between the foci of the ellipse defined by the equation $x^2 + 5y^2 = 20$.\n\nFirst, we must convert the given equation into the standard form of an ellipse centered at the origin, which is $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ or $\\frac{x^2}{b^2} + \\frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively, with $a > b$. To do this, we divide the entire equation by 20:\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{20} + \\frac{5y^2}{20} = \\frac{20}{20}\n$$\nSimplifying the second term gives the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{20} + \\frac{y^2}{4} = 1\n$$\nBy comparing this to the standard form, we can identify the values of $a^2$ and $b^2$. The larger denominator is $a^2$ and the smaller is $b^2$. Thus, we have:\n$$\na^2 = 20\n$$\n$$\nb^2 = 4\n$$\nSince the larger denominator is under the $x^2$ term, the major axis of the ellipse lies along the x-axis.\n\nFor an ellipse, the distance from the center to each focus, denoted by $c$, is related to $a$ and $b$ by the equation:\n$$\nc^2 = a^2 - b^2\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found for $a^2$ and $b^2$:\n$$\nc^2 = 20 - 4 = 16\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides to find $c$:\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n$$\nThis value, $c=4$ cm, represents the distance from the center of the ellipse to one of the foci. The problem asks for the total distance between the two foci. This distance is $2c$.\n$$\n\\text{Distance between foci} = 2c = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n$$\nThe coordinates are given in centimeters, so the distance between the shock wave generator and the kidney stone is 8 cm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "2159737"}, {"introduction": "While the semi-major and semi-minor axes define the size of an ellipse, its shape—how circular or elongated it is—is captured by a single number: eccentricity, $e$.
