Instead of simply accepting that a ray from one focus reflects to the other, this practice guides you to prove a specific case using first principles from calculus and geometry. By analyzing a ray striking the ellipse at its co-vertex, you will use differentiation to find the tangent and normal lines, and then apply the law of reflection to determine the path of the reflected ray. This is an essential step in building an intuitive and rigorous understanding of how the elliptical shape directs light. [@problem_id:2154255]", "problem": "A light ray is emitted from one focus, $F_1$, of an ellipse and travels towards the ellipse. The ellipse is centered at the origin and is described by the equation $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, with $a > b > 0$ being positive real constants. The foci of the ellipse are located at $F_1(-c, 0)$ and $F_2(c, 0)$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$. The ray strikes the ellipse at the point $P(0, b)$, which is the upper co-vertex. Upon striking the surface, the ray reflects according to the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection with respect to the surface normal. Determine the equation for the path of the reflected ray. Express your answer for $y$ as a function of $x$ and the constants $a$ and $b$.", "solution": "The solution involves several steps: finding the slope of the incident ray, finding the slope of the tangent (and thus the normal) at the point of incidence, applying the law of reflection to find the slope of the reflected ray, and finally writing the equation of the reflected ray.\n\nFirst, we determine the slope of the incident ray. The ray travels from the focus $F_1(-c, 0)$ to the point of incidence $P(0, b)$. The slope, $m_{\\text{inc}}$, is given by the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$:\n$$m_{\\text{inc}} = \\frac{b - 0}{0 - (-c)} = \\frac{b}{c}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the normal to the ellipse at the point of incidence $P(0, b)$. The slope of the normal is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent at that point. We find the slope of the tangent by implicitly differentiating the equation of the ellipse, $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{2x}{a^2} + \\frac{2y}{b^2}\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$\nSolving for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, the slope of the tangent line, we get:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{b^2 x}{a^2 y}$$\nNow, we evaluate this slope at the point of incidence $P(0, b)$:\n$$m_{\\text{tan}} = \\frac{dy}{dx}\\bigg|_{(0,b)} = -\\frac{b^2 (0)}{a^2 (b)} = 0$$\nA tangent slope of 0 means the tangent line is horizontal ($y=b$). The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent, so it must be a vertical line. The equation of the normal line passing through $(0,b)$ is $x=0$, which is the y-axis.\n\nNow we apply the law of reflection. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. These angles are measured with respect to the normal line, which is the y-axis. Let $\\phi_{\\text{inc}}$ be the angle the incident ray makes with the positive x-axis, and $\\phi_{\\text{refl}}$ be the angle the reflected ray makes with the positive x-axis. We know that $\\tan(\\phi_{\\text{inc}}) = m_{\\text{inc}} = b/c$.\nThe reflection is about the vertical normal line ($x=0$). If a line making an angle $\\phi$ with the positive x-axis is reflected across a vertical line, the angle of the reflected line, $\\phi'$, is given by $\\phi' = \\pi - \\phi$. Therefore, for the reflected ray:\n$$\\phi_{\\text{refl}} = \\pi - \\phi_{\\text{inc}}$$\nThe slope of the reflected ray, $m_{\\text{refl}}$, is the tangent of this new angle:\n$$m_{\\text{refl}} = \\tan(\\phi_{\\text{refl}}) = \\tan(\\pi - \\phi_{\\text{inc}}) = -\\tan(\\phi_{\\text{inc}}) = -m_{\\text{inc}}$$\nSo, the slope of the reflected ray is $m_{\\text{refl}} = -b/c$.\n\nFinally, we write the equation of the reflected ray. This ray passes through the point of incidence $P(0, b)$ and has a slope of $m_{\\text{refl}} = -b/c$. Using the point-slope form of a line, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$:\n$$y - b = -\\frac{b}{c}(x - 0)$$\n$$y = -\\frac{b}{c}x + b$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in terms of $a$ and $b$.

This exercise provides a concrete scenario with a specific elliptical mirror and an incoming light ray.
