In doing so, it provides a powerful visual proof, giving you a deep and lasting intuition for why the distance from a minor-axis endpoint to a focus is precisely equal to the semi-major axis length, $a$.", "problem": "An optical engineer is tasked with precisely locating the focal points of a newly fabricated elliptical mirror. The mirror's shape is defined by its semi-major axis of length $a$ and its semi-minor axis of length $b$. On a full-scale template, the major and minor axes are drawn, intersecting at the center of the ellipse. To find the foci, the engineer employs a classical geometric construction using a compass and a straightedge.\n\nThe procedure begins by placing the sharp point of the compass on one of the two endpoints of the minor axis. The compass radius is then adjusted to a specific length, and an arc is drawn such that it intersects the major axis at two points. These two intersection points are the foci of the ellipse.\n\nDetermine the distance from the center of the ellipse to either one of these focal points.

Let the major axis lie along the x-axis and the minor axis along the y-axis. The vertices along the major axis are at $(\\pm a, 0)$, and the vertices along the minor axis are at $(0, \\pm b)$. The foci are located on the major axis at coordinates $(\\pm c, 0)$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to a focus, which we need to find.\n\nThe fundamental definition of an ellipse is the set of all points $P$ for which the sum of the distances from $P$ to the two foci, $F_1$ and $F_2$, is a constant. This constant sum is equal to the length of the major axis, $2a$.\n$$d(P, F_1) + d(P, F_2) = 2a$$\nThe problem describes a construction where the compass point is placed at an endpoint of the minor axis. Let's choose the point $P_{top} = (0, b)$ as this point on the ellipse. The foci are $F_1 = (-c, 0)$ and $F_2 = (c, 0)$.\n\nAccording to the definitional property of the ellipse, the sum of the distances from $P_{top}$ to the two foci must be $2a$:\n$$d(P_{top}, F_1) + d(P_{top}, F_2) = 2a$$\nWe can calculate these distances using the distance formula. The distance from $P_{top}(0, b)$ to $F_1(-c, 0)$ is:\n$$d(P_{top}, F_1) = \\sqrt{(-c - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + b^2}$$\nThe distance from $P_{top}(0, b)$ to $F_2(c, 0)$ is:\n$$d(P_{top}, F_2) = \\sqrt{(c - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + b^2}$$\nAs expected, due to symmetry, these two distances are equal.\n\nSubstituting these into the ellipse definition:\n$$\\sqrt{c^2 + b^2} + \\sqrt{c^2 + b^2} = 2a$$\n$$2\\sqrt{c^2 + b^2} = 2a$$\n$$\\sqrt{c^2 + b^2} = a$$\nThis result reveals a key geometric insight of the construction: the distance from an endpoint of the minor axis to either focus is exactly the length of the semi-major axis, $a$.
