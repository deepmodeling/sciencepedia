This exercise challenges you to apply the scalar projection formula within a unit cube, a fundamental shape in three-dimensional space.

Express your final answer as an exact value in simplest radical form.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we first establish a coordinate system to represent the cube and its diagonals as vectors.\n\nLet's place one vertex of the unit cube at the origin $O(0,0,0)$ of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. We can align the edges of the cube that meet at the origin along the positive x, y, and z axes. Consequently, the vertices of the cube can be represented by coordinates $(x, y, z)$ where each coordinate is either 0 or 1.\n\nThe common origin of the two diagonals is the vertex $O(0,0,0)$.\n\nFirst, we define the space diagonal vector. A space diagonal starting from the origin connects $O(0,0,0)$ to the opposite vertex of the cube, which is $P(1,1,1)$. Let's denote the space diagonal vector as $\\vec{s}$.\n$$ \\vec{s} = P - O = \\langle 1-0, 1-0, 1-0 \\rangle = \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle $$\n\nNext, we define the face diagonal vector. A face diagonal starting from the origin must lie on one of the coordinate planes (the xy-plane, yz-plane, or xz-plane). Due to the symmetry of the cube, the choice of face does not affect the final result. Let's choose the face diagonal that lies on the xy-plane. This diagonal connects the origin $O(0,0,0)$ to the vertex $Q(1,1,0)$. Let's denote this face diagonal vector as $\\vec{f}$.\n$$ \\vec{f} = Q - O = \\langle 1-0, 1-0, 0-0 \\rangle = \\langle 1, 1, 0 \\rangle $$\n\nThe problem asks for the scalar projection of the space diagonal vector ($\\vec{s}$) onto the face diagonal vector ($\\vec{f}$).
