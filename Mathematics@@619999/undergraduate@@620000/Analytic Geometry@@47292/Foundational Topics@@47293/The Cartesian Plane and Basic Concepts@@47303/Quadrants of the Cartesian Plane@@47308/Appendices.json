The condition for the fourth quadrant is $x > 0$ and $y < 0$. We need to analyze the sign of each linear function $L_1, L_2, L_3$ to determine the possible values for the bits $b_1, b_2, b_3$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the bit $b_2$ from $L_2(x, y) = x - y$.**\nGiven that the point is in the fourth quadrant, we have $x > 0$ and $y < 0$.\nIf $y < 0$, then $-y > 0$.\nThe function $L_2$ can be written as the sum of $x$ and $(-y)$. Since $x > 0$ and $-y > 0$, their sum must also be positive.\n$L_2(x,y) = x + (-y) > 0$.\nSince $L_2$ is always strictly positive, it can never be less than or equal to zero.\nAccording to the rule, $b_2 = 1$ if $L_2 \\ge 0$. Since $L_2 > 0$ is always true, the bit $b_2$ must always be 1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the bit $b_1$ from $L_1(x, y) = x + y$.**\nFor a point in the fourth quadrant, $x$ is positive and $y$ is negative. The sign of their sum, $x+y$, depends on the relative magnitudes of $x$ and $y$. Let's consider three cases:\n- Case (i): The magnitude of $x$ is greater than the magnitude of $y$. That is, $|x| > |y|$, which is equivalent to $x > -y$ since $x>0$ and $y<0$. In this case, $x+y > 0$. For example, the point $(5, -2)$ gives $L_1 = 3 > 0$. For this case, $L_1 > 0$, so $b_1=1$.\n- Case (ii): The magnitude of $x$ is less than the magnitude of $y$. That is, $|x| < |y|$, which is equivalent to $x < -y$. In this case, $x+y < 0$. For example, the point $(2, -5)$ gives $L_1 = -3 < 0$. For this case, $L_1 < 0$, so $b_1=0$.\n- Case (iii): The magnitude of $x$ is equal to the magnitude of $y$. That is, $|x| = |y|$, which is equivalent to $x = -y$. In this case, $x+y = 0$. For example, the point $(3, -3)$ gives $L_1 = 0$. For this case, $L_1 = 0$, so according to the rule $b_1=1$ (since $L_1 \\ge 0$).\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the bit $b_1$ can be either 0 or 1, depending on the specific location of the point in the fourth quadrant.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the bit $b_3$ from $L_3(x, y) = -x - y$.**\nWe can see that $L_3$ is directly related to $L_1$:\n$L_3(x, y) = -x - y = -(x+y) = -L_1(x, y)$.\nThe value of $b_3$ is therefore completely determined by the sign of $L_1$. We use the same three cases from Step 2:\n- Case (i): $L_1 > 0$. This implies $L_3 = -L_1 < 0$. According to the rule for $b_3$, this gives $b_3 = 0$. In this case, the pair $(b_1, b_3)$ is $(1, 0)$.\n- Case (ii): $L_1 < 0$. This implies $L_3 = -L_1 > 0$. According to the rule for $b_3$, this gives $b_3 = 1$. In this case, the pair $(b_1, b_3)$ is $(0, 1)$.\n- Case (iii): $L_1 = 0$. This implies $L_3 = -L_1 = 0$. The rule for $b_1$ is $b_1=1$ if $L_1 \\ge 0$, and the rule for $b_3$ is $b_3=1$ if $L_3 \\ge 0$. Since both $L_1$ and $L_3$ are 0, both $b_1=1$ and $b_3=1$. In this case, the pair $(b_1, b_3)$ is $(1, 1)$.\n\nSo, the possible pairs of values for $(b_1, b_3)$ are $(1, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to find all possible signatures.**\nWe have determined:\n- $b_1$ can be 0 or 1.\n- $b_2$ must be 1.\n- $b_3$ depends on $b_1$. The possible $(b_1, b_3)$ pairs are $(1,0), (0,1), (1,1)$.\n\nLet's construct the full signatures $b_1b_2b_3$ by combining the possibilities:\n- If $(b_1, b_3) = (1, 0)$ and $b_2=1$, the signature is `110`. This occurs when $x+y > 0$.\n- If $(b_1, b_3) = (0, 1)$ and $b_2=1$, the signature is `011`. This occurs when $x+y < 0$.\n- If $(b_1, b_3) = (1, 1)$ and $b_2=1$, the signature is `111`. This occurs when $x+y = 0$.\n\nAll three of these scenarios are possible for points in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, the complete set of all possible signatures is {`110`, `011`, `111`}.
