We will explore a fundamental geometric concept known as the radical axis—the set of all points from which the tangent lengths to two distinct circles are equal.

Determine this expression $f(x, y)$, normalized such that the coefficients of $x$, $y$, and the constant term are coprime integers, and the coefficient of the $x$ term is positive.", "solution": "Let $P(x,y)$ be a point in the plane. For a circle with equation $S(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}+2gx+2fy+c=0$, the square of the length of the tangent from $P$ equals the power of $P$ with respect to the circle, which is $S(x,y)$ evaluated at $P$.
