The axes are defined such that all distances are measured in meters. A stationary sensor is located at the point with coordinates $P = (5.0, 12.0, -8.0)$. A long, thin, vertical pole is installed such that it aligns perfectly with the $z$-axis of the coordinate system. Calculate the shortest possible straight-line distance from the sensor to the vertical pole. Express your answer in meters.", "solution": "Let the coordinates of the sensor be $P = (x_P, y_P, z_P) = (5.0, 12.0, -8.0)$. The vertical pole is aligned with the $z$-axis. Any arbitrary point on the $z$-axis can be represented by coordinates $Q = (0, 0, z)$ for some real number $z$.\n\nThe problem asks for the shortest straight-line distance from the point $P$ to the line representing the $z$-axis. The distance $d$ between point $P$ and an arbitrary point $Q$ on the $z$-axis is given by the three-dimensional distance formula:\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x_P - x_Q)^2 + (y_P - y_Q)^2 + (z_P - z_Q)^2}$$\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$:\n$$d = \\sqrt{(5.0 - 0)^2 + (12.0 - 0)^2 + (-8.0 - z)^2}$$\n$$d = \\sqrt{5.0^2 + 12.0^2 + (-8.0 - z)^2}$$\n$$d = \\sqrt{25.0 + 144.0 + (z+8.0)^2}$$\n$$d = \\sqrt{169.0 + (z+8.0)^2}$$\n\nTo find the shortest distance, we need to minimize this expression for $d$ with respect to the variable $z$. The distance $d$ will be minimal when the quantity under the square root is minimal. The term $169.0$ is constant. The term $(z+8.0)^2$ is a squared real number, so its minimum value is $0$. This minimum occurs when $z+8.0 = 0$, which means $z = -8.0$.\n\nThis value of $z$ corresponds to the point on the $z$-axis that is closest to $P$. This point is $Q_{closest} = (0, 0, -8.0)$. This point is the orthogonal projection of point $P$ onto the $z$-axis.\n\nNow, we substitute $z = -8.0$ back into our distance expression to find the minimum distance, $d_{min}$:\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{169.0 + (-8.0+8.0)^2}$$\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{169.0 + 0^2}$$\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{169.0}$$\n$$d_{min} = 13.0$$\n\nAlternatively, one can recognize geometrically that the shortest distance from a point $(x_P, y_P, z_P)$ to the $z$-axis is the distance from that point to its orthogonal projection onto the $z$-axis, which is the point $(0, 0, z_P)$. The distance between these two points is:\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{(x_P - 0)^2 + (y_P - 0)^2 + (z_P - z_P)^2}$$\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{x_P^2 + y_P^2 + 0^2}$$\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{x_P^2 + y_P^2}$$\nThis is the length of the projection of the position vector of $P$ onto the $xy$-plane.\nUsing the given coordinates $P = (5.0, 12.0, -8.0)$:\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{5.0^2 + 12.0^2}$$\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{25.0 + 144.0}$$\n$$d_{min} = \\sqrt{169.0}$$\n$$d_{min} = 13.0$$\n\nThe shortest distance from the sensor to the vertical pole is 13.0 meters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{13.0}$$", "id": "2170126"}]}
