This first practice explores the inverse: what happens when there are no real solutions? By determining when a horizontal line fails to intersect a hyperbola, you will directly connect the geometric concept of non-intersection to an algebraic inequality, a condition where a quadratic equation yields no real roots [@problem_id:2158241].", "problem": "In the Cartesian coordinate system, a hyperbola is defined by the equation $y^2 - x^2 = 4$. A family of horizontal lines is described by the equation $y = c$, where $c$ is a real-valued constant. The problem is to find the range of values for $c$ for which the horizontal line $y = c$ does not intersect the hyperbola. This range can be described as an open interval $(a, b)$. Determine the values of the lower bound $a$ and the upper bound $b$.\n\nExpress your answer as a pair of numbers $(a, b)$, representing the lower and upper bounds of this interval, respectively.", "solution": "We want the horizontal line $y=c$ to have no real intersection with the hyperbola $y^2-x^2=4$.

The point $(x_0, y_0)$ must lie on both curves.\n2. The slopes of the tangent lines to both curves must be equal at that point.\n\nLet's write these conditions as a system of equations.\nFrom condition 1, the point $(x_0, y_0)$ satisfies the equations of both the parabola and the circle:\n$$y_0 = x_0^2 \\quad \\quad (1)$$\n$$x_0^2 + (y_0 - c)^2 = 1 \\quad \\quad (2)$$\n\nFrom condition 2, we need to find the derivatives of both functions and equate them at $(x_0, y_0)$.\nFor the parabola, $y = x^2$, the derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$$\nSo, the slope at $(x_0, y_0)$ is $m_p = 2x_0$.\n\nFor the circle, $x^2 + (y-c)^2 = 1$, we use implicit differentiation with respect to $x$:\n$$2x + 2(y-c)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{y-c}$$\nSo, the slope at $(x_0, y_0)$ is $m_c = -\\frac{x_0}{y_0 - c}$.\n\nEquating the slopes gives us our third equation:\n$$2x_0 = -\\frac{x_0}{y_0 - c} \\quad \\quad (3)$$\n\nNow we solve the system of equations (1), (2), and (3). Let's start with equation (3):\n$$2x_0 + \\frac{x_0}{y_0 - c} = 0$$\n$$x_0 \\left(2 + \\frac{1}{y_0 - c}\\right) = 0$$\nThis equation holds true if either $x_0 = 0$ or $2 + \\frac{1}{y_0 - c} = 0$. We analyze these two cases separately.\n\nCase 1: $x_0 = 0$.\nIf the tangency occurs at $x_0 = 0$, we can use equation (1) to find the y-coordinate:\n$$y_0 = 0^2 = 0$$\nSo, one possible point of tangency is the origin, $(0, 0)$. This point must also lie on the circle. We substitute $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$ into equation (2):\n$$0^2 + (0 - c)^2 = 1$$\n$$c^2 = 1$$\n$$c = \\pm 1$$\nThus, for $c=1$ and $c=-1$, the circle is tangent to the parabola at the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nCase 2: $x_0 \\neq 0$.\nIn this case, we must satisfy the second part of the factored slope equation:\n$$2 + \\frac{1}{y_0 - c} = 0$$\n$$2 = -\\frac{1}{y_0 - c}$$\n$$y_0 - c = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nWe can use this relationship in the circle equation (2): $x_0^2 + (y_0 - c)^2 = 1$.\n$$x_0^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 1$$\n$$x_0^2 + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$$\n$$x_0^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nNow, we use the parabola equation (1), $y_0 = x_0^2$, to find the y-coordinate of tangency:\n$$y_0 = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nFinally, we find the value of $c$ using the relationship $y_0 - c = -1/2$:\n$$c = y_0 + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$c = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\nFor $c=5/4$, the circle is tangent to the parabola at two points, where $x_0 = \\pm\\sqrt{3}/2$ and $y_0 = 3/4$.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the possible values for $c$ are $-1$, $1$, and $5/4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  \\frac{5}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2158238"}]}
