The base connection is trivial. The warping function is $h(r) = f(r)$. The gradient is $\\text{grad } f = f'(r) \\partial_r$, and its squared norm is $\\|\\text{grad } f\\|_{g_B}^2 = g_{dr^2}(f'(r)\\partial_r, f'(r)\\partial_r) = (f'(r))^2$. The Hessian applied to the unit vector field $\\partial_r$ is $\\text{Hess}(f)(\\partial_r, \\partial_r) = f''(r)$. The fiber is $(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}, g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}})$, which is a space of constant sectional curvature equal to $1$.\n\nWe now apply these formulas to the two types of planes specified.\n\n1.  **Radial Plane**: A $2$-plane containing the radial direction $\\partial_r$. Such a plane is spanned by $\\partial_r$ and a vector $v$ tangent to the $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ factor. The sectional curvature, which we denote by $K_{rad}$, is:\n    $$K_{rad}(r) = -\\frac{\\text{Hess}(f)(\\partial_r, \\partial_r)}{f(r) \\|\\partial_r\\|^2} = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r) \\cdot 1} = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}.$$\n\n2.  **Tangential Plane**: A $2$-plane tangent to the $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ factor. For any such plane, the sectional curvature of the corresponding plane in the fiber $(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}, g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}})$ is $1$. The sectional curvature of the tangential plane in $M$, denoted by $K_{tan}$, is:\n    $$K_{tan}(r) = \\frac{1 - \\|\\text{grad } f\\|^2}{f(r)^2} = \\frac{1 - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2}.$$\n\nNext, we require the manifold to have constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. This means that the sectional curvature is independent of the point and the choice of the $2$-plane at that point. Therefore, we must have $K_{rad} = K_{tan} = \\kappa$. This gives a system of two differential equations for $f(r)$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} = \\kappa  (1) \\\\\n\\frac{1 - (f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} = \\kappa  (2)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nEquation ($1$) can be written as $f''(r) + \\kappa f(r) = 0$. This is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE).\nEquation ($2$) can be written as $(f'(r))^2 + \\kappa f(r)^2 = 1$.\nThese two equations are not independent. Differentiating the second equation with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$2f'(r)f''(r) + \\kappa(2f(r)f'(r)) = 0$$\nAssuming $f'(r)$ is not identically zero (which would imply $f$ is constant, a case that only works for $\\kappa=0$ and is not general), we can divide by $2f'(r)$ to obtain:\n$$f''(r) + \\kappa f(r) = 0$$\nwhich is the first equation. Thus, the condition for constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$ is that $f(r)$ must satisfy the ODE $f''(r) + \\kappa f(r) = 0$, along with the first-order constraint $(f'(r))^2 + \\kappa f(r)^2 = 1$. The ODE is the primary governing equation.\n\nFor the metric $g = dr^2 + f(r)^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ to be smooth at $r=0$, extending the coordinate chart to include a \"pole\" at the origin around which $(r, \\omega)$ are geodesic polar coordinates, the function $f(r)$ must satisfy certain regularity conditions. In a neighborhood of the origin, a smooth Riemannian metric must be approximated by the Euclidean metric. The Euclidean metric in polar coordinates is $dr^2 + r^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$. By comparing this with the given metric, we see that $f(r)$ must behave like $r$ for small $r$. A rigorous analysis shows that the metric is smooth at the pole if and only if $f(r)$ is a smooth, odd function of $r$. The Taylor series expansion of $f(r)$ around $r=0$ must begin as $f(r) = r + O(r^3)$. This implies the following conditions at $r=0$:\n1.  $f(0) = 0$: This ensures the sphere of radius $r=0$ shrinks to a point.\n2.  $f'(0) = 1$: This ensures the metric is locally Euclidean at the pole, avoiding a conical singularity.\n\nThese two conditions, $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$, are the required regularity conditions. Note that these conditions, together with the ODE $f''(r) + \\kappa f(r)=0$, automatically imply that $f$ is an odd function, as $f''(0) = -\\kappa f(0) = 0$, $f'''(0) = -\\kappa f'(0) = -\\kappa$, and so on, with all even-order derivatives at $r=0$ vanishing.\n\nFinally, we specialize to the case of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa = -1$. The ODE becomes:\n$$f''(r) - f(r) = 0$$\nThe general solution to this linear ODE can be written as $f(r) = A e^r + B e^{-r}$ or, more conveniently for initial value problems at $r=0$, in terms of hyperbolic functions:\n$$f(r) = C \\cosh(r) + D \\sinh(r)$$\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants. We apply the regularity conditions to determine these constants.\n1.  Using $f(0)=0$:\n    $$f(0) = C \\cosh(0) + D \\sinh(0) = C \\cdot 1 + D \\cdot 0 = C$$\n    Thus, we must have $C=0$. The function is of the form $f(r) = D \\sinh(r)$.\n2.  Using $f'(0)=1$:\n    The derivative is $f'(r) = D \\cosh(r)$.\n    $$f'(0) = D \\cosh(0) = D \\cdot 1 = D$$\n    Thus, we must have $D=1$.\n\nThe unique smooth warping function for $\\kappa=-1$ satisfying the regularity conditions is $f(r) = \\sinh(r)$.

Then $u_1 = v_1 = 0$.\n$K(\\sigma) = \\langle R(u,v)v, u \\rangle = \\langle R^2(u,v)v, u \\rangle_{g_2} = K_2(\\sigma) = k_2$.\nThis case is possible only if $m_2 \\ge 2$.\n\nCase 3: The plane $\\sigma$ is a \"mixed\" plane.\nLet $u \\in T_{p_1}M_1$ and $v \\in T_{p_2}M_2$. Since the tangent space splits orthogonally, we can choose $u$ and $v$ to be orthonormal.\n$u = u_1$, $v = v_2$, with $u_2=0$ and $v_1=0$.\nUsing the formula for the product curvature tensor with $X=u, Y=v, Z=v$:\n$R(u,v)v = R(u_1, v_2)v_2 = R^1(u_1, 0)(v_1=0) + R^2(0, v_2)v_2$.\nSince the Riemann tensor is linear in its first two slots, $R^1(u_1, 0) = 0$ and $R^2(0, v_2) = 0$.\nTherefore, $R(u,v)v = 0$.\nThe sectional curvature is $K(\\sigma) = \\langle R(u,v)v, u \\rangle = \\langle 0, u \\rangle = 0$.\nThis case is possible as long as $m_1 \\ge 1$ and $m_2 \\ge 1$.\n\nFor $(M,g)$ to be a space form of constant sectional curvature $k$, the sectional curvatures of all $2$-planes at all points must be equal to $k$. If $m_1 \\ge 1$ and $m_2 \\ge 1$, there always exist mixed planes, so we must have $k=0$. If, in addition, $m_1 \\ge 2$, there are planes tangent to $M_1$, so we must have $k_1 = k = 0$. If $m_2 \\ge 2$, we must have $k_2 = k = 0$. If $m_1 = 1$, as a $1$-manifold, its curvature $k_1$ is by definition $0$. The same holds if $m_2=1$. Thus, for a product of non-trivial manifolds ($m_1, m_2 \\ge 1$) to be a space form, it is necessary that $k_1 = k_2 = 0$. In this case, all sectional curvatures are $0$, and the product is a flat manifold (a space form of constant curvature $0$).\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. In a Riemannian product $\\left(M_1 \\times M_2, g_1 \\oplus g_2\\right)$ with $m_1 \\ge 1$ and $m_2 \\ge 1$, every $2$-plane spanned by one vector tangent to $M_1$ and one tangent to $M_2$ has sectional curvature equal to the common value $k$ whenever $k_1 = k_2 = k$.\n\nOur analysis in Case 3 showed that the sectional curvature of such a \"mixed\" plane is always $0$, regardless of the values of $k_1$ and $k_2$. The statement claims the curvature is $k$. This is true only if $k=0$. If $k \\ne 0$, the statement is false. For example, for the product of two spheres $S^m(k)$ with $k0$, the mixed plane curvature is $0$, not $k$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. In a Riemannian product $\\left(M_1 \\times M_2, g_1 \\oplus g_2\\right)$ with $m_1 \\ge 1$ and $m_2 \\ge 1$, any $2$-plane spanned by one vector tangent to $M_1$ and one tangent to $M_2$ has sectional curvature equal to $0$, while $2$-planes tangent to a single factor have sectional curvature equal to that factor’s constant curvature. Therefore, the product can have constant sectional curvature only if $k_1 = k_2 = 0$, in which case the constant is $0$.\n\nThis statement accurately summarizes our findings. The first part correctly identifies the curvatures of mixed planes ($0$) and pure planes ($k_1$ or $k_2$). The second part draws the correct logical conclusion: for the curvature to be constant, all these values must be equal. Since the mixed plane curvature is always $0$, the constant must be $0$. This implies $k_1=0$ (if $m_1 \\ge 2$) and $k_2=0$ (if $m_2 \\ge 2$). If $m_i=1$, $k_i$ is already $0$. Therefore, the only possibility for a product of non-trivial factors to be a space form is for both factors to be flat ($k_1=k_2=0$), resulting in a flat product manifold.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. If exactly one of $k_1$ or $k_2$ equals $0$ and the other is positive, then $\\left(M_1 \\times M_2, g_1 \\oplus g_2\\right)$ has constant sectional curvature $0$.\n\nLet's assume $k_1  0$ and $k_2 = 0$, with $m_1 \\ge 2$ and $m_2 \\ge 1$ to ensure the existence of the relevant planes. According to our analysis, there will be $2$-planes tangent to $M_1$ with sectional curvature $k_1  0$. There will also be mixed $2$-planes with sectional curvature $0$. Since $k_1 \\ne 0$, the sectional curvature is not constant. Therefore, the product manifold is not a space form. The statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. If one factor is $0$-dimensional (trivial), then $\\left(M_1 \\times M_2, g_1 \\oplus g_2\\right)$ is isometric to the other factor and hence is a space form with the other factor’s curvature.\n\nA connected $0$-dimensional manifold must be a single point. Let $m_2 = 0$, so $M_2 = \\{p_0\\}$. The product manifold is $M_1 \\times \\{p_0\\}$. This space is in a one-to-one correspondence with $M_1$ via the natural projection map. The tangent space $T_{(p_1, p_0)}M$ is simply $T_{p_1}M_1 \\oplus \\{0\\}$, which is naturally identified with $T_{p_1}M_1$. The product metric $g = g_1 \\oplus g_2$ reduces to $g_1$, as the metric $g_2$ on a point is trivial. Thus, the product manifold is isometric to $(M_1, g_1)$. Since $(M_1, g_1)$ is given to be a space form with constant curvature $k_1$, the product manifold is also a space form with curvature $k_1$. This statement correctly describes this trivial case.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. If $k_1 = k_2 = k \\ne 0$, then $\\left(M_1 \\times M_2, g_1 \\oplus g_2\\right)$ has constant sectional curvature $k$ because both factors agree on curvature.\n\nThis is a common misconception. Assume $m_1 \\ge 1$ and $m_2 \\ge 1$. As shown in Case 3, there always exist mixed $2$-planes, and their sectional curvature is invariably $0$. If $k_1 = k_2 = k \\ne 0$, we have some planes with curvature $k$ (e.g., those tangent to $M_1$ if $m_1 \\ge 2$) and other planes with curvature $0$. Since $k \\ne 0$, the sectional curvature is not constant. The reasoning \"because both factors agree on curvature\" is insufficient to guarantee the product is a space form.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "3061773"}]}
