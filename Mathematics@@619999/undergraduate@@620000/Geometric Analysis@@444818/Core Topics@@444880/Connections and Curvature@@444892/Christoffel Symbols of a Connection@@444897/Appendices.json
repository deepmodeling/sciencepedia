The calculation must be based on the fundamental properties of the Levi-Civita connection, namely that it is torsion-free and metric-compatible, which give rise to the Koszul formula.\n\nFirst, we identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ and its inverse $g^{ij}$ in the coordinate system $(x^1, x^2) = (x, y)$.
