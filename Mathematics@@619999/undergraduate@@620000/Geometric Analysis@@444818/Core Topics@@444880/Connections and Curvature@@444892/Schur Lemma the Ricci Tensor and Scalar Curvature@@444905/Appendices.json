The problem provides the definitions of the Riemann curvature tensor $R$, the sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$, and the scalar curvature $S$.\n\nA manifold of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$ is characterized by a specific form of its Riemann curvature tensor. For any tangent vectors $X, Y, Z$ at a point $p \\in M$, the $(1,3)$-tensor $R$ is given by:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y \\right)\n$$\nWe can verify that this formula is consistent with the provided definition of sectional curvature. Let $\\{u,v\\}$ be an orthonormal pair of vectors spanning a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p M$. The sectional curvature is defined as $K(\\sigma) = g(R(u,v)v, u)$. Using the formula for $R$:\n$$\ng(R(u,v)v, u) = g(\\kappa(g(v,v)u - g(u,v)v), u)\n$$\nSince $u$ and $v$ are orthonormal, $g(u,u) = 1$, $g(v,v) = 1$, and $g(u,v) = 0$. Substituting these values gives:\n$$\ng(\\kappa(1 \\cdot u - 0 \\cdot v), u) = g(\\kappa u, u) = \\kappa g(u,u) = \\kappa \\cdot 1 = \\kappa\n$$\nThis confirms that the formula for $R$ correctly reproduces the constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. The problem statement mentions Schur's lemma, which for $n \\ge 3$ ensures that if the sectional curvature at each point is isotropic (independent of the $2$-plane), it must be constant throughout the connected manifold. Here, we are given that the sectional curvature is a global constant $\\kappa$, so this condition is already satisfied.\n\nNext, we compute the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$. Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p M$. The Ricci tensor component $\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j)$ for a basis vector $e_j$ is given by the trace of the curvature operator:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(R(e_j, e_i)e_i, e_j)\n$$\nWe can analyze the terms in this summation.\nThe term for $i=j$ is $g(R(e_j, e_j)e_j, e_j)$. The Riemann tensor is antisymmetric in its first two arguments, so $R(e_j, e_j)Z = 0$ for any vector $Z$. Thus, this term is $0$.\n\nThe sum is therefore taken over all indices $i \\neq j$. For each such term, we use the explicit formula for $R$:\n$$\ng(R(e_j, e_i)e_i, e_j) = g(\\kappa(g(e_i, e_i)e_j - g(e_j, e_i)e_i), e_j)\n$$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, we have $g(e_i, e_i) = 1$ and $g(e_j, e_i) = \\delta_{ji}$. As we are considering $i \\neq j$, $g(e_j, e_i) = 0$. Substituting these values:\n$$\ng(\\kappa(1 \\cdot e_j - 0 \\cdot e_i), e_j) = g(\\kappa e_j, e_j) = \\kappa g(e_j, e_j) = \\kappa \\cdot 1 = \\kappa\n$$\nEach term in the sum for $i \\neq j$ is equal to $\\kappa$. There are $n-1$ such terms (for $i=1, \\dots, n$ with $i \\neq j$). Therefore, the Ricci curvature in the direction $e_j$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j) = \\sum_{i=1, i \\neq j}^{n} \\kappa = (n-1)\\kappa\n$$\nSince the choice of orthonormal basis was arbitrary, this holds for any unit vector. This implies that the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric, $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)\\kappa g$, and the manifold is an Einstein manifold.\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar curvature $S$, which is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric $g$. Using the same orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we found for $\\operatorname{Ric}(e_j, e_j)$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (n-1)\\kappa\n$$\nThe term $(n-1)\\kappa$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $j$.

The scalar curvature of the fiber manifold is thus $\\bar{R} = R(g_F) = m(m-1)\\kappa$.\n\nWe will derive the expression for $R(g)$ from the fundamental definition of the scalar curvature as the trace of the Ricci tensor, which is itself a trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. A robust method is to sum all sectional curvatures over a local orthonormal basis for the tangent space of $M$. The scalar curvature $R$ at a point $p \\in M$ is given by\n$$R = \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le m+1} 2K(E_i, E_j)$$\nwhere $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^{m+1}$ is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_pM$, and $K(E_i, E_j)$ is the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by $E_i$ and $E_j$.\n\nLet us construct a suitable local orthonormal frame.

We have $g(E_a, E_b) = g(\\frac{1}{f(r)} e_a, \\frac{1}{f(r)} e_b) = \\frac{1}{f(r)^2} g(e_a, e_b) = \\frac{1}{f(r)^2} f(r)^2 g_F(e_a, e_b) = g_F(e_a, e_b) = \\delta_{ab}$.\nThe vector fields $E_0$ and $E_a$ are also orthogonal, since the metric $g$ has no cross-terms between $dr$ and $g_F$. Thus, $\\{E_0, E_1, \\dots, E_m\\}$ constitutes a local orthonormal frame for $(M, g)$. The dimension of $M$ is $n=m+1$.\n\nFor a warped product manifold of this form, the sectional curvatures in this frame are given by two standard formulas derived from the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor:\n1. For a plane spanned by two vectors tangent to the fiber, $E_a$ and $E_b$ ($a \\neq b$):\n$$K(E_a, E_b) = \\frac{1}{f(r)^2} \\bar{K}(e_a, e_b) - \\left(\\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\right)^2$$\nwhere $\\bar{K}(e_a, e_b)$ is the sectional curvature in the fiber manifold $(F, g_F)$.\n\n2.

Substituting this into our expression for $R(g)$:\n$$R(g) = \\frac{m(m-1)\\kappa}{f(r)^2} - m(m-1) \\frac{f'(r)^2}{f(r)^2} - 2m \\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}$$\nThis is the final expression for the scalar curvature of the warped product manifold $(M,g)$.\n\nFor completeness, let's consider the special case where $f(r)$ is a constant, say $f(r)=c$. Then $f'(r)=0$ and $f''(r)=0$. The formula gives $R(g) = \\frac{m(m-1)\\kappa}{c^2} = \\frac{\\bar{R}}{c^2}$. This is correct, as $(M,g)$ becomes the product manifold $(\\mathbb{R}, dr^2) \\times (F, c^2 g_F)$. The scalar curvature of a product is the sum of the scalar curvatures of the factors. $R(\\mathbb{R}) = 0$. The scalar curvature of $(F, c^2 g_F)$ is $c^{-2} \\bar{R}$, as scaling a metric by a constant $c^2$ scales its scalar curvature by $c^{-2}$. Thus, $R(g) = 0 + c^{-2}\\bar{R}$, which matches our result.\n\nThe mention of Schur's lemma for dimension $m+1 \\ge 3$ is also consistent. If we impose the condition that all sectional curvatures are equal to a constant $C$ at a point, we get a differential equation for $f(r)$. For example, taking $m+1=3$ (so $m=2$), isotropy requires $K(E_1, E_2) = K(E_0, E_1)$, which means $\\frac{\\kappa}{f^2} - (\\frac{f'}{f})^2 = -\\frac{f''}{f}$.

A manifold has pointwise isotropic sectional curvature $K(p)$ if and only if its Riemann curvature tensor has the form:\n    $$R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$$\n2.  The Ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor:\n    $$\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = g^{kl} R_{ikjl} = g^{kl} K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk}) = K(g^{kl}g_{ik}g_{jl} - g^{kl}g_{il}g_{jk})$$\n    $$\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = K(\\delta^l_i g_{jl} - \\delta^k_i g_{jk}) = K(g_{ij} - n g_{ij}) = (1-n)K g_{ij} = -(n-1)K g_{ij}$$\n    The conventional definition of the Riemann tensor $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$ and $R_{ijkl} = g(R(e_k, e_l)e_j, e_i)$ leads to $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = (n-1)K g_{ij}$. We will proceed with this sign convention.\n3.  The scalar curvature is $R = g^{ij} \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = g^{ij} (n-1)K g_{ij} = (n-1)K g^{ij}g_{ij} = n(n-1)K$.\n4.  The contracted Bianchi identity states $\\nabla^i \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_j R$.\n5.  The left-hand side is $\\nabla^i \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\nabla^i((n-1)K g_{ij}) = (n-1)\\nabla^i(K g_{ij})$. Since $\\nabla g = 0$, this becomes $(n-1) g_{ij} \\nabla^i K = (n-1) \\nabla_j K$.\n6.  The right-hand side is $\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_j R = \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_j (n(n-1)K) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\nabla_j K$.\n7.  Equating the two sides gives:\n    $$(n-1)\\nabla_j K = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\nabla_j K$$\n    $$(n-1) \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right) \\nabla_j K = 0$$\n    $$\\frac{(n-1)(2-n)}{2} \\nabla_j K = 0$$\n8.  If $n \\ge 3$, then $n-1 \\neq 0$ and $2-n \\neq 0$. This forces $\\nabla_j K = 0$ for all $j$, which means the gradient of $K$ is zero. Since $M$ is connected, $K$ must be a constant. If $n=2$, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot \\nabla_j K = 0$, which is always true and places no restriction on $K$.\n\n**Schur's Lemma (Einstein Manifold Version):** If $(M^n, g)$ is a connected Einstein manifold of dimension $n \\ge 3$ (i.e., $\\operatorname{Ric} = f g$ for a smooth function $f$), then $f$ must be a constant. The proof is analogous and also fails for $n=2$.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In dimension $n=2$, there exist connected Riemannian manifolds with pointwise isotropic sectional curvature at every point and nonconstant scalar curvature.**\n\nIn dimension $n=2$, at any point $p \\in M$, the tangent space $T_p M$ is a $2$-plane. There is only one $2$-plane to choose, so the sectional curvature $K(p, \\sigma)$ is uniquely determined for any $\\sigma$. Thus, any $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold has pointwise isotropic sectional curvature by definition. The function $K(p)$ is simply the Gaussian curvature, $K_G(p)$.\n\nFor $n=2$, the scalar curvature $R$ is related to the Gaussian curvature $K_G$ by $R = 2 K_G$. The statement is equivalent to asking if there exists a connected $2$-manifold with nonconstant Gaussian curvature $K_G$. If $K_G$ is nonconstant, then $R=2K_G$ is also nonconstant.\n\nMany such manifolds exist. For instance, any smooth surface of revolution in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ generated by a curve that is not a circle or a line will have non-constant Gaussian curvature. A specific example is an ellipsoid with three distinct semi-axes. Its Gaussian curvature varies from point to point.\n\nAs shown in the proof sketch of Schur's Lemma, the crucial step yields the equation $\\frac{(n-1)(2-n)}{2} \\nabla_j K = 0$. For $n=2$, this becomes $0=0$, an identity that provides no information about $\\nabla_j K$. Thus, the mathematical argument for constancy fails, and counterexamples are expected and do exist.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In dimension $n \\ge 3$, there exist connected Riemannian manifolds with $\\operatorname{Ric} = f g$ for a smooth, nonconstant function $f$, so that the scalar curvature is nonconstant despite the Einstein-type relation.**\n\nThis statement directly contradicts the Einstein manifold version of Schur's Lemma. Let's retrace the argument for this case. Assume $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = f g_{ij}$. The scalar curvature is $R = g^{ij} \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = g^{ij} f g_{ij} = f n$.\nThe contracted Bianchi identity $\\nabla^i \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_j R$ becomes:\nLHS: $\\nabla^i (f g_{ij}) = (\\nabla^i f) g_{ij} + f (\\nabla^i g_{ij}) = \\nabla_j f$ (since $\\nabla g = 0$).\nRHS: $\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_j (nf) = \\frac{n}{2} \\nabla_j f$.\nEquating them gives $\\nabla_j f = \\frac{n}{2} \\nabla_j f$, which implies $(1 - \\frac{n}{2}) \\nabla_j f = 0$.\nFor $n \\ge 3$, the factor $(1 - \\frac{n}{2})$ is non-zero. Thus, we must have $\\nabla_j f = 0$ for all $j$. Since the manifold $M$ is connected, this implies that $f$ must be a constant function. If $f$ is constant, then the scalar curvature $R = nf$ is also constant.\n\nThe statement claims that such a manifold exists with a nonconstant function $f$. This is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If $M$ is disconnected and $n \\ge 3$, there exist Riemannian metrics with pointwise isotropic sectional curvature such that the curvature function $K$ is constant on each connected component but attains different constant values on different components, hence $K$ is not globally constant on $M$.**\n\nSchur's Lemma requires the manifold $M$ to be connected. If this hypothesis is dropped, the conclusion of global constancy may fail. Let's construct a counterexample.\nLet $M_1$ be the standard $n$-sphere $S^n$ with the metric of constant sectional curvature $K_1 = 1$. Let $M_2$ be the standard $n$-sphere $S^n$ with the metric of constant sectional curvature $K_2 = 2$. Both are connected manifolds of dimension $n$ and have pointwise isotropic sectional curvature. Since $n \\ge 3$, this is a non-trivial property.\nNow, let $M$ be the disjoint union of $M_1$ and $M_2$, i.e., $M = M_1 \\coprod M_2$. $M$ is a disconnected Riemannian manifold. The metric on $M$ exhibits pointwise isotropic sectional curvature. We can define a function $K \\colon M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as\n$$ K(p) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } p \\in M_1 \\\\ 2  \\text{if } p \\in M_2 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function $K$ represents the sectional curvature at each point. $K$ is constant on each connected component of $M$. However, $K$ is not globally constant on $M$ since it takes two distinct values, $1$ and $2$. This demonstrates that the connectivity assumption in Schur's Lemma is essential.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In dimension $n \\ge 3$, there exist connected Riemannian manifolds with pointwise isotropic sectional curvature at every point and nonconstant scalar curvature.**\n\nThis statement is a direct contradiction of the primary version of Schur's Lemma for $n \\ge 3$. As derived above, for a connected manifold $(M^n, g)$ with $n \\ge 3$, if the sectional curvature is pointwise isotropic, given by a function $K$, then $K$ must be constant.\nThe scalar curvature is given by $R = n(n-1)K$. If $K$ is a constant, say $K_0$, then $R = n(n-1)K_0$ is also a constant. Therefore, it is impossible for such a manifold to have a nonconstant scalar curvature. The statement claims such manifolds exist.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3061256"}]}
