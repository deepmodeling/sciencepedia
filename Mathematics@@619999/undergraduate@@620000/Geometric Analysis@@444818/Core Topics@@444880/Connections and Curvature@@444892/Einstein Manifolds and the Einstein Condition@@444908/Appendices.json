It is self-contained, objective, and requires a standard derivation based on fundamental principles.\n\nLet $\\left(M,g\\right)$ be an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. It is given that $\\left(M,g\\right)$ is an Einstein manifold, which means its Ricci curvature tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}(g)$ is proportional to the metric tensor $g$. The constant of proportionality is the Einstein constant $\\lambda$, so we have the relation $\\operatorname{Ric}(g)=\\lambda\\,g$. Let $R$ be the scalar curvature of $g$. We are asked to find the Einstein constant $\\lambda'$ and the scalar curvature $R'$ for the rescaled metric $g' = c\\,g$, where $c$ is a positive constant, $c0$.\n\nTo solve this, we will proceed by determining how the fundamental geometric quantities—the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the scalar curvature—transform under the scaling $g \\to g' = c\\,g$.\n\nFirst, we find the relationship between the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla'$ of $g'$ and the connection $\\nabla$ of $g$. The Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by the Koszul formula. For any vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ on $M$, the Koszul formula for $\\nabla'$ is:\n$$\n2 g'(\\nabla'_X Y, Z) = X(g'(Y,Z)) + Y(g'(X,Z)) - Z(g'(X,Y)) + g'([X,Y],Z) + g'([Z,X],Y) - g'([Y,Z],X)\n$$\nSubstituting $g' = c\\,g$ into this equation, and noting that $c$ is a constant so its Lie derivative is zero, we get:\n$$\n2 c\\,g(\\nabla'_X Y, Z) = X(c\\,g(Y,Z)) + Y(c\\,g(X,Z)) - Z(c\\,g(X,Y)) + c\\,g([X,Y],Z) + c\\,g([Z,X],Y) - c\\,g([Y,Z],X)\n$$\nSince $c$ is a constant, we can factor it out from the derivatives on the right-hand side:\n$$\n2 c\\,g(\\nabla'_X Y, Z) = c \\left( X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y],Z) + g([Z,X],Y) - g([Y,Z],X) \\right)\n$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is precisely $2\\,g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)$, the Koszul formula for the connection $\\nabla$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n2 c\\,g(\\nabla'_X Y, Z) = c \\left( 2\\,g(\\nabla_X Y, Z) \\right)\n$$\nSince $c  0$, we can divide by $2c$, which yields $g(\\nabla'_X Y, Z) = g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)$. Because this holds for all vector fields $Z$ and the metric $g$ is non-degenerate, we conclude that the vector arguments must be identical:\n$$\n\\nabla'_X Y = \\nabla_X Y\n$$\nThis shows that the Levi-Civita connection is invariant under a constant scaling of the metric, i.e., $\\nabla' = \\nabla$.\n\nNext, we examine the Riemann curvature tensor, which is defined in terms of the connection:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z\n$$\nThe corresponding tensor for the metric $g'$ is $R'(X,Y)Z$. Since we have established that $\\nabla' = \\nabla$, the expression for $R'(X,Y)Z$ is identical to that for $R(X,Y)Z$:\n$$\nR'(X,Y)Z = \\nabla'_X \\nabla'_Y Z - \\nabla'_Y \\nabla'_X Z - \\nabla'_{[X,Y]} Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z = R(X,Y)Z\n$$\nThis means that the Riemann curvature tensor of type $(1,3)$ is also invariant under the scaling.\n\nNow we derive the Ricci curvature tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}(g')$. In local coordinates $\\{x^i\\}$, the components of the Ricci tensor are given by the contraction $Ric_{jk} = R^i_{jik}$, where $R^i_{jik}$ are the components of the type $(1,3)$ Riemann tensor. Since the tensors $R'$ and $R$ are identical, their components in any given coordinate system must also be identical: $R'^i_{jik} = R^i_{jik}$. Consequently, the components of the Ricci tensor are also invariant:\n$$\nRic'_{jk} = R'^i_{jik} = R^i_{jik} = Ric_{jk}\n$$\nThis means that as a $(0,2)$-tensor field, $\\operatorname{Ric}(g') = \\operatorname{Ric}(g)$.\n\nThe initial condition is that $(M,g)$ is Einstein with constant $\\lambda$, so $\\operatorname{Ric}(g) = \\lambda\\,g$, which in component form is $Ric_{jk} = \\lambda\\,g_{jk}$. Using the invariance of the Ricci tensor components, we have:\n$$\nRic'_{jk} = \\lambda\\,g_{jk}\n$$\nTo find the new Einstein constant $\\lambda'$, we need to express this relationship in terms of the new metric $g'$. From $g' = c\\,g$, we have $g'_{jk} = c\\,g_{jk}$, which gives $g_{jk} = \\frac{1}{c}g'_{jk}$. Substituting this into the equation for $Ric'_{jk}$:\n$$\nRic'_{jk} = \\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{c}g'_{jk} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{c} \\right) g'_{jk}\n$$\nThis shows that the manifold $(M,g')$ is also an Einstein manifold, with the relation $\\operatorname{Ric}(g') = \\lambda'g'$. By comparing the component forms, we identify the new Einstein constant $\\lambda'$ as:\n$$\n\\lambda' = \\frac{\\lambda}{c}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar curvature $R'$ of the metric $g'$. The scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric. For the metric $g$, this is $R = \\operatorname{tr}_g(\\operatorname{Ric}(g)) = g^{ij}Ric_{ij}$. For the metric $g'$, it is $R' = \\operatorname{tr}_{g'}(\\operatorname{Ric}(g')) = g'^{ij}Ric'_{ij}$.\nThe components of the inverse metric $g'^{-1}$ are related to those of $g^{-1}$ by $g'^{ij} = \\frac{1}{c}g^{ij}$. We also know that $Ric'_{ij} = Ric_{ij}$. Substituting these into the expression for $R'$:\n$$\nR' = \\left(\\frac{1}{c}g^{ij}\\right) Ric_{ij} = \\frac{1}{c} (g^{ij}Ric_{ij})\n$$\nSince $R = g^{ij}Ric_{ij}$, we obtain the scalar curvature of the rescaled metric:\n$$\nR' = \\frac{R}{c}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. The new Einstein constant is $\\lambda' = \\lambda/c$ and the new scalar curvature is $R' = R/c$.

The Ricci tensor of the product manifold $\\left(M_{1} \\times M_{2}, g_{1} + g_{2}\\right)$ is given by the direct sum of the Ricci tensors of the factors.

We can decompose them into their components tangent to $M^{n}$ (denoted $V_{M}$ and $W_{M}$) and tangent to $\\mathbb{R}$ (denoted $V_{\\mathbb{R}}$ and $W_{\\mathbb{R}}$).

To do this, we test the condition on two types of vector fields.\n\nCase $1$: Let $V$ and $W$ be vector fields that are purely tangent to the manifold $M^{n}$. Thus, $V = V_{M}$ and $W = W_{M}$, with $V_{\\mathbb{R}} = 0$ and $W_{\\mathbb{R}} = 0$.\nThe Einstein condition states:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{G}(V, W) = \\Lambda G(V, W) $$\nFor these vector fields, the left side is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}(V, W)$.\nThe right side is $\\Lambda G(V, W) = \\Lambda (g(V, W) + dt^{2}(0, 0)) = \\Lambda g(V, W)$.\nSo, the condition becomes $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}(V, W) = \\Lambda g(V, W)$.\nWe are given that $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is an Einstein manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} = \\lambda g$. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\lambda g(V, W) = \\Lambda g(V, W) $$\nSince this must hold for all vector fields $V, W$ tangent to $M^{n}$, and the metric $g$ is non-degenerate, we must have $\\lambda = \\Lambda$.\n\nCase $2$: Let $T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ be the coordinate vector field tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor. This vector field is purely tangent to $\\mathbb{R}$, so $T_{M} = 0$ and $T_{\\mathbb{R}} = T$.\nThe Einstein condition for the pair of vectors $\\left(T, T\\right)$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{G}(T, T) = \\Lambda G(T, T) $$\nFor these vectors, the left side is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}(T_{M}, T_{M}) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g}(0, 0) = 0$.\nThe metric $G$ evaluated on $\\left(T, T\\right)$ is $G(T, T) = g(T_{M}, T_{M}) + dt^{2}(T_{\\mathbb{R}}, T_{\\mathbb{R}}) = g(0, 0) + dt^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = 0 + 1 = 1$.\nThus, the Einstein condition for this component becomes:\n$$ 0 = \\Lambda \\cdot 1 $$\nThis implies $\\Lambda = 0$.\n\nFor the product manifold $\\left(M^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}, G\\right)$ to be an Einstein manifold, both conditions derived above must be satisfied simultaneously.
