The region $\\mathcal{R}$ is a simple closed patch on the cylinder, so it is topologically a disk, and its Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\mathcal{R}) = 1$. The theorem becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathcal{R}} K\\,dA + \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{R}} \\kappa_g\\,ds + \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\alpha_i = 2\\pi $$\n\nWe analyze the term $\\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{R}} \\kappa_g\\,ds$. The boundary $\\partial \\mathcal{R}$ consists of four segments: two segments of constant $z$ (circles) and two segments of constant $\\theta$ (vertical lines). In the locally flat coordinates $(u, v) = (R\\theta, z)$, these boundary segments correspond to horizontal and vertical straight lines. Straight lines in a flat (Euclidean) space are geodesics. Geodesics, by definition, have a geodesic curvature of $\\kappa_g=0$. Therefore, all four boundary segments of $\\mathcal{R}$ are geodesics on the surface $S_R$. This implies that the integral of the geodesic curvature along the boundary is zero:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{R}} \\kappa_g\\,ds = 0 $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the sum of the exterior angles $\\sum \\alpha_i$. The boundary corners are the intersections of curves with constant $\\theta$ and curves with constant $z$. The tangent vectors to these curves are $\\mathbf{X}_{\\theta}$ and $\\mathbf{X}_z$, respectively. In part (a), we calculated the coefficient $g_{12} = F = \\mathbf{X}_\\theta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_z = 0$, which shows that the coordinate curves are orthogonal everywhere. Consequently, the interior angle at each of the four corners of the patch $\\mathcal{R}$ is $\\pi/2$. The exterior angle is defined as $\\alpha_i = \\pi - (\\text{interior angle})$. Thus, each exterior angle is:\n$$ \\alpha_i = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThe sum of the four exterior angles is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\alpha_i = 4 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2\\pi $$\n\nSubstituting these results into the Gauss-Bonnet formula:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathcal{R}} K\\,dA + 0 + 2\\pi = 2\\pi $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathcal{R}} K\\,dA = 0 $$\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem, applied using only boundary data, implies that the total Gaussian curvature over the patch is zero. Since this holds for any arbitrary patch $\\mathcal{R}$, it is consistent with the fact that the Gaussian curvature $K$ is identically zero everywhere on the cylinder, as found in parts (a) and (b).\n\nFinally, we report the pair $(K,H)$ as a row vector, using the results from part (a):\n$$ (K, H) = \\left(0, -\\frac{1}{2R}\\right) $$\nThe sign of the mean curvature $H$ is a consequence of the specified outward-pointing normal vector convention and the definition $S = -d\\mathbf{n}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\frac{1}{2R} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "3076242"}, {"introduction": "Moving from specific examples to a general class of surfaces, this practice guides you to derive a universal formula for the Gaussian curvature of any surface of revolution.

Its partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\partial_1 g_{22} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(\\phi(u)^2) = 2\\phi(u)\\phi'(u)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_2 g_{22} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(\\phi(u)^2) = 0\n$$\nAll other partial derivatives of metric components are zero, since $g_{11}$ is constant and $g_{12}$ is zero.\n\nLet's compute the non-zero Christoffel symbols:\nFor $\\Gamma^k_{11}$:\n$$ \\Gamma^k_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} ( \\partial_1 g_{1l} + \\partial_1 g_{1l} - \\partial_l g_{11} ) = 0 $$\nsince $g_{11}$ is constant and $g_{12}=0$.\n\nFor $\\Gamma^k_{12} = \\Gamma^k_{21}$:\n$$ \\Gamma^1_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{1l} (\\partial_1 g_{2l} + \\partial_2 g_{1l} - \\partial_l g_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{21} + \\partial_2 g_{11} - \\partial_1 g_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(0+0-0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{2l} (\\partial_1 g_{2l} + \\partial_2 g_{1l} - \\partial_l g_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22}(\\partial_1 g_{22} + \\partial_2 g_{12} - \\partial_2 g_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22}(\\partial_1 g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2\\phi^2}(2\\phi\\phi') = \\frac{\\phi'}{\\phi} $$\n\nFor $\\Gamma^k_{22}$:\n$$ \\Gamma^1_{22} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{1l} (\\partial_2 g_{2l} + \\partial_2 g_{2l} - \\partial_l g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11}(\\partial_2 g_{21} + \\partial_2 g_{21} - \\partial_1 g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(0+0-2\\phi\\phi') = -\\phi\\phi' $$\n$$ \\Gamma^2_{22} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{2l} (\\partial_2 g_{2l} + \\partial_2 g_{2l} - \\partial_l g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22}(\\partial_2 g_{22} + \\partial_2 g_{22} - \\partial_2 g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_2 g_{22}) = 0 $$\n\nThe only non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$$\n\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\Gamma^2_{21} = \\frac{\\phi'(u)}{\\phi(u)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Gamma^1_{22} = -\\phi(u)\\phi'(u)\n$$\n\nThe next step is to compute the Riemann curvature tensor. For a $2$-dimensional manifold, there is only one independent component, which determines the Gaussian curvature. We can find it by calculating $R^1_{212}$. The formula for the Riemann tensor is:\n$$\nR^l_{kij} = \\partial_i \\Gamma^l_{kj} - \\partial_j \\Gamma^l_{ki} + \\sum_m (\\Gamma^m_{kj} \\Gamma^l_{mi} - \\Gamma^m_{ki} \\Gamma^l_{mj})\n$$\nLet's compute $R^1_{212}$ (where $l=1, k=2, i=1, j=2$):\n$$\nR^1_{212} = \\partial_1 \\Gamma^1_{22} - \\partial_2 \\Gamma^1_{21} + (\\Gamma^1_{22}\\Gamma^1_{11} + \\Gamma^2_{22}\\Gamma^1_{21}) - (\\Gamma^1_{21}\\Gamma^1_{12} + \\Gamma^2_{21}\\Gamma^1_{22})\n$$\nUsing the Christoffel symbols we found: $\\Gamma^1_{21}=0$, $\\Gamma^k_{11}=0$, $\\Gamma^2_{22}=0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nR^1_{212} = \\partial_1 \\Gamma^1_{22} - 0 + (0+0) - (0 + \\Gamma^2_{21}\\Gamma^1_{22}) = \\partial_1 \\Gamma^1_{22} - \\Gamma^2_{21}\\Gamma^1_{22}\n$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for the Christoffel symbols:\n$$\n\\partial_1 \\Gamma^1_{22} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(-\\phi\\phi') = -(\\phi'\\phi' + \\phi\\phi'') = -(\\phi')^2 - \\phi\\phi''\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^2_{21}\\Gamma^1_{22} = \\left(\\frac{\\phi'}{\\phi}\\right)(-\\phi\\phi') = -(\\phi')^2\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $R^1_{212}$:\n$$\nR^1_{212} = (-(\\phi')^2 - \\phi\\phi'') - (-(\\phi')^2) = -\\phi\\phi''\n$$\nSo, $R^1_{212} = -\\phi(u)\\phi''(u)$.\n\nThe Gaussian curvature $K$ is given by the formula $K = \\frac{R_{1212}}{\\det(g)}$. The covariant component $R_{1212}$ is related to the mixed tensor component $R^k_{lmn}$ by lowering the first index: $R_{klij} = g_{km}R^m_{lij}$.\n$$\nR_{1212} = g_{1m}R^m_{212} = g_{11}R^1_{212} + g_{12}R^2_{212}\n$$\nSince $g_{11}=1$ and $g_{12}=0$, we have $R_{1212} = R^1_{212} = -\\phi(u)\\phi''(u)$.\nThe determinant of the metric is $\\det(g) = g_{11}g_{22} - (g_{12})^2 = 1 \\cdot \\phi(u)^2 - 0 = \\phi(u)^2$.\n\nFinally, the Gaussian curvature is:\n$$\nK = \\frac{R_{1212}}{\\det(g)} = \\frac{-\\phi(u)\\phi''(u)}{\\phi(u)^2}\n$$\nSince $\\phi(u)  0$, we can simplify this to obtain the final expression for the Gaussian curvature as a function of $u$:\n$$\nK(u) = -\\frac{\\phi''(u)}{\\phi(u)}\n$$\n\nThe geometric interpretation of this result is as follows. The parameter $u$ is the arc length along the meridian (profile curve). The function $\\phi(u)$ is the distance from the axis of revolution. The term $\\phi''(u)$ is the acceleration of the profile curve, which measures its concavity.\nSince $\\phi(u)0$, the sign of the Gaussian curvature $K$ is opposite to the sign of $\\phi''(u)$.\n- If $K0$, then $\\phi''(u)0$. The profile curve is concave down, meaning it bends toward the axis of revolution. This creates a locally elliptic or dome-like shape, such as a sphere.\n- If $K0$, then $\\phi''(u)0$. The profile curve is concave up, meaning it bends away from the axis of revolution. This creates a locally hyperbolic or saddle-like shape, such as a hyperboloid or a pseudosphere.\n- If $K=0$, then $\\phi''(u)=0$. The profile curve is a straight line (or a segment of one). This generates a developable surface like a cylinder (if the line is parallel to the axis) or a cone (if the line intersects the axis).\nThe magnitude $|K|$ is proportional to $|\\phi''(u)|$, the sharpness of the meridian's bend, and inversely proportional to $\\phi(u)$, the distance from the axis. This means that a sharp bend in the meridian has a more significant effect on the intrinsic curvature when it occurs closer to the axis of revolution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{\\phi''(u)}{\\phi(u)}}\n$$", "id": "3076247"}]}
