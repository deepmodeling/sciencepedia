It involves standard concepts such as conformal metric changes, arc length, and geodesic distance on a Riemannian manifold. The given metric $g' = \\exp(2u(r))\\delta$ is positive-definite since the conformal factor $\\exp(2u(r))$ is always positive.

It is a standard, self-contained, and well-posed problem in geometric analysis. The solution process can now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe geodesic distance between two points in a Riemannian manifold is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise differentiable curves connecting the two points. The length $L$ of a curve $\\gamma: [a,b] \\to M$ in a manifold $(M, g)$ is given by the integral $L(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} \\, dt$.\n\nThe given metric is $g' = \\exp(2u(r))\\delta$, where $u(r)$ depends only on the Euclidean distance $r$ from the origin. This metric is rotationally symmetric. For any two points $p_1, p_2$ that lie on a radial line from the origin, the geodesic connecting them is the radial line segment itself. In our case, we seek the distance from the origin ($r=0$) to a point on the sphere of Euclidean radius $R$. Due to the symmetry, we can calculate the length of any radial path from the origin to this sphere.\n\nLet us consider a radial path parameterized by the Euclidean radius $r$. We can represent such a path as $\\mathbf{x}(r) = (r, 0, \\ldots, 0)$ in Cartesian coordinates, for $r \\in [0, R]$. The tangent vector to this path is $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dr} = (1, 0, \\ldots, 0)$, which has a constant Euclidean norm of $1$.\n\nThe length element $ds'$ in the metric $g'$ for a displacement $d\\mathbf{x}$ is given by $ds'^2 = g'(d\\mathbf{x}, d\\mathbf{x}) = \\exp(2u(r))\\delta(d\\mathbf{x}, d\\mathbf{x}) = \\exp(2u(r)) ds^2$, where $ds$ is the Euclidean length element. For our radial path, $d\\mathbf{x}$ corresponds to a change $dr$ along the radius, so $ds = dr$. The speed of the path $\\mathbf{x}(r)$ with respect to the parameter $r$ is:\n$$\n\\left\\|\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dr}\\right\\|_{g'} = \\sqrt{g'\\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dr}, \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dr}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\exp(2u(r))\\delta\\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dr}, \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dr}\\right)} = \\exp(u(r)) \\left\\|\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dr}\\right\\|_{\\delta} = \\exp(u(r)) \\cdot 1 = \\exp(u(r))\n$$\nThe geodesic distance, denoted $d_{g'}(R)$, from the origin to the sphere of radius $R$ is the length of this path, obtained by integrating the speed from $r=0$ to $r=R$:\n$$\nd_{g'}(R) = \\int_0^R \\exp(u(r)) \\, dr\n$$\nWe are given $u(r) = -\\alpha \\ln(R_{0} - r)$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\exp(u(r)) = \\exp(-\\alpha \\ln(R_{0} - r)) = \\left( \\exp(\\ln(R_{0} - r)) \\right)^{-\\alpha} = (R_{0} - r)^{-\\alpha}\n$$\nThe distance integral becomes:\n$$\nd_{g'}(R) = \\int_0^R (R_{0} - r)^{-\\alpha} \\, dr\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the substitution $s = R_{0} - r$, which implies $ds = -dr$. The limits of integration change from $r=0$ to $s=R_{0}$ and from $r=R$ to $s=R_{0}-R$.\n$$\nd_{g'}(R) = \\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{0}-R} s^{-\\alpha} (-ds) = \\int_{R_{0}-R}^{R_{0}} s^{-\\alpha} \\, ds\n$$\nSince the problem specifies that $\\alpha \\neq 1$, we can use the power rule for integration $\\int s^k ds = \\frac{s^{k+1}}{k+1} + C$. Here, $k=-\\alpha$.\n$$\nd_{g'}(R) = \\left[ \\frac{s^{-\\alpha+1}}{-\\alpha+1} \\right]_{R_{0}-R}^{R_{0}} = \\frac{s^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\bigg|_{R_{0}-R}^{R_{0}}\n$$\nEvaluating at the limits:\n$$\nd_{g'}(R) = \\frac{R_{0}^{1-\\alpha} - (R_{0} - R)^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the geodesic distance from the origin to the sphere of Euclidean radius $R$.\n\nNow, we analyze the distance to the boundary, which corresponds to the limit as $R \\to R_{0}^{-}$.\n$$\nd_{boundary} = \\lim_{R \\to R_{0}^{-}} \\frac{R_{0}^{1-\\alpha} - (R_{0} - R)^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha}\n$$\nThe behavior of this limit depends on the sign of the exponent $1-\\alpha$. The problem states $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\alpha \\neq 1$. We consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $0 < \\alpha < 1$.\nIn this case, the exponent $1-\\alpha$ is positive. As $R \\to R_{0}^{-}$, the term $(R_{0} - R) \\to 0^{+}$. Therefore, $(R_{0} - R)^{1-\\alpha} \\to 0$.\nThe limit is:\n$$\nd_{boundary} = \\frac{R_{0}^{1-\\alpha} - 0}{1-\\alpha} = \\frac{R_{0}^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha}\n$$\nSince $R_{0} > 0$ and $1-\\alpha > 0$, this is a finite positive value. Thus, for $0 < \\alpha < 1$, the distance to the boundary is finite.\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha > 1$.\nIn this case, the exponent $1-\\alpha$ is negative. Let $1-\\alpha = -\\beta$ where $\\beta = \\alpha - 1 > 0$.\nThe term $(R_{0} - R)^{1-\\alpha}$ becomes $(R_{0} - R)^{-\\beta} = \\frac{1}{(R_{0} - R)^{\\beta}}$. As $R \\to R_{0}^{-}$, $(R_{0} - R) \\to 0^{+}$, so $(R_{0} - R)^{\\beta} \\to 0^{+}$. This implies $\\frac{1}{(R_{0} - R)^{\\beta}} \\to +\\infty$.\nThe limit becomes:\n$$\nd_{boundary} = \\lim_{R \\to R_{0}^{-}} \\frac{R_{0}^{1-\\alpha} - (R_{0} - R)^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\to \\frac{R_{0}^{1-\\alpha} - (\\infty)}{1-\\alpha}\n$$\nSince the denominator $1-\\alpha$ is negative, the expression tends to $+\\infty$. Thus, for $\\alpha > 1$, the distance to the boundary is infinite.\n\nIn summary, the manifold $(B_{R_0}(0), g')$ is complete (all geodesics can be extended indefinitely) if and only if $\\alpha \\ge 1$. Since the case $\\alpha=1$ is excluded, the distance to the boundary is infinite if $\\alpha > 1$ and finite if $0 < \\alpha < 1$. The problem asks for the explicit expression for the distance to a radius $R < R_0$, which is the principal result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_{0}^{1-\\alpha} - (R_{0} - R)^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha}}$$", "id": "3043439"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple distances, we are interested in how fundamental differential operators, like the Laplace-Beltrami operator, behave under conformal changes.
