The second partial derivatives are:\n$$\nf_{xx}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3x^{2} - 3y^{2} + y\\cos(xy) + 4x - 3y) = 6x - y^{2}\\sin(xy) + 4\n$$\n$$\nf_{xy}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^{2} - 3y^{2} + y\\cos(xy) + 4x - 3y) = -6y + \\cos(xy) - xy\\sin(xy) - 3\n$$\n$$\nf_{yy}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-6xy + x\\cos(xy) - 3x + 2y) = -6x - x^{2}\\sin(xy) + 2\n$$\nEvaluating these at $(0,0)$:\n$$\nf_{xx}(0,0) = 6(0) - 0 \\cdot \\sin(0) + 4 = 4\n$$\n$$\nf_{xy}(0,0) = -6(0) + \\cos(0) - 0 \\cdot \\sin(0) - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2\n$$\n$$\nf_{yy}(0,0) = -6(0) - 0 \\cdot \\sin(0) + 2 = 2\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix at $(0,0)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hess}(f)(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4  -2 \\\\ -2  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the formulas derived in Part 1, we compute the mean and Gaussian curvatures at $P=(0,0,0)$:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2}(f_{xx}(0,0) + f_{yy}(0,0)) = \\frac{1}{2}(4 + 2) = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n$$\n$$\nK = f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0) - (f_{xy}(0,0))^{2} = (4)(2) - (-2)^{2} = 8 - 4 = 4\n$$\n\nPart 3: Classification of the point\n\nThe classification of a point on a surface as elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic is determined by the sign of the Gaussian curvature $K$.\n- If $K0$, the point is elliptic.\n- If $K0$, the point is hyperbolic.\n- If $K=0$, the point is parabolic.\n\nAt the point $P=(0,0,0)$, we found $K=4$. Since $K0$, the point $P$ is an elliptic point.\n\nThis can be understood in terms of the principal curvatures $k_1, k_2$, which are the eigenvalues of the shape operator $S = \\mathrm{Hess}(f)(0,0)$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(S - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix} 4-\\lambda  -2 \\\\ -2  2-\\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = (4-\\lambda)(2-\\lambda) - 4 = \\lambda^{2} - 6\\lambda + 8 - 4 = \\lambda^{2} - 6\\lambda + 4 = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $k_{1,2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-16}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}$.\nSo, $k_1 = 3 + \\sqrt{5}$ and $k_2 = 3 - \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nAn elliptic point is one where the principal curvatures have the same sign. Since $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236  3$, both $k_1$ and $k_2$ are positive. This confirms that $P$ is an elliptic point.\nThe sign of $K$ is given by $K = k_1 k_2 = (3+\\sqrt{5})(3-\\sqrt{5}) = 9-5=4$. Since both principal curvatures are positive, their product $K$ is positive. At an elliptic point, the surface is locally dome-like or bowl-like, lying entirely on one side of its tangent plane.\nThe sign of $H$ is determined by $H = \\frac{1}{2}(k_1 + k_2) = \\frac{1}{2}((3+\\sqrt{5})+(3-\\sqrt{5})) = 3$. Since both principal curvatures are positive, their average $H$ is also positive. This indicates that the surface is, on average, curving in the direction of the normal vector $N$. Since $N$ points in the positive $z$-direction at $P$, a positive mean curvature implies the surface is shaped like a bowl opening upwards, which corresponds to a local minimum of the function $f(x,y)$. The second derivative test for $f$ at $(0,0)$ confirms this: $D = f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2 = K = 4  0$ and $f_{xx}=40$, indicating a local minimum.\n\nThe final computed values for the ordered pair $(H,K)$ at $P$ are $(3,4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3  4 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3069493"}]}
