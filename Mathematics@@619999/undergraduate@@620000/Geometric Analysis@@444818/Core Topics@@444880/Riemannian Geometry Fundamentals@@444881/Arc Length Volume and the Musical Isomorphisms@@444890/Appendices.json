The integrand is the Lagrangian $L(\\theta, z, \\dot{\\theta}, \\dot{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}(4\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\dot{z}^2)$.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of Geodesic Equations**\n\nGeodesics are the curves that locally minimize arc length, which is equivalent to extremizing the energy functional. The equations of motion are the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}^i}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x^i} = 0\n$$\nfor each coordinate $x^i \\in \\{\\theta, z\\}$.\n\nFor the coordinate $\\theta$:\nThe partial derivatives of the Lagrangian are\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\frac{1}{2}(8\\dot{\\theta}) = 4\\dot{\\theta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(4\\dot{\\theta}) - 0 = 0 \\implies 4\\ddot{\\theta} = 0 \\implies \\ddot{\\theta} = 0\n$$\n\nFor the coordinate $z$:\nThe partial derivatives of the Lagrangian are\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{z}} = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\dot{z}) = \\dot{z}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for $z$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{z}) - 0 = 0 \\implies \\ddot{z} = 0\n$$\nThus, the geodesic equations are $\\ddot{\\theta} = 0$ and $\\ddot{z} = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Conservation of the Covector $\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\flat}$**\n\nThe musical isomorphism `flat` ($\\flat$) maps a tangent vector $v = v^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ to a cotangent vector (a $1$-form) $v^{\\flat} = p_j dx^j$ where the components are $p_j = g_{ji}v^i$. For the tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\dot{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} + \\dot{z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, the corresponding covector $\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\flat}$ has components $p_\\theta$ and $p_z$:\n$$\np_\\theta = g_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta} + g_{\\theta z}\\dot{z} = 4\\dot{\\theta}\n$$\n$$\np_z = g_{z\\theta}\\dot{\\theta} + g_{zz}\\dot{z} = \\dot{z}\n$$\nThese components $p_\\theta$ and $p_z$ are the generalized momenta conjugate to the coordinates $\\theta$ and $z$, respectively, as they are equal to $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{z}}$.\n\nThe geodesic equations derived above, $\\frac{d}{dt}(4\\dot{\\theta}) = 0$ and $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{z}) = 0$, can be written in terms of these components as:\n$$\n\\frac{d p_\\theta}{dt} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d p_z}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThese equations state that the components of the covector $\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\flat}$ are constant along the geodesic curve $\\gamma(t)$. Therefore, the covector $\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\flat}(t) = p_\\theta(t) d\\theta + p_z(t) dz$ is constant for all $t$. This demonstrates the conservation of $\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\flat}$ along the geodesic. This is a direct consequence of the metric components being independent of the coordinates $\\theta$ and $z$ (i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ are Killing vector fields).\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Specific Geodesic**\n\nWe are given the initial conditions:\n1. Position: $\\gamma(0) = (\\theta(0), z(0)) = (0,0)$.\n2. Initial covector: $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)^{\\flat} = 6\\,d\\theta + 1\\,dz$.\n\nFrom the initial covector, we identify its components at $t=0$:\n$$\np_\\theta(0) = 6\n$$\n$$\np_z(0) = 1\n$$\nDue to the conservation established in Step 2, these components are constant for all $t$:\n$$\np_\\theta(t) = 4\\dot{\\theta}(t) = 6 \\implies \\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n$$\np_z(t) = \\dot{z}(t) = 1\n$$\nWe integrate these first-order differential equations to find the path $\\gamma(t) = (\\theta(t), z(t))$:\n$$\n\\theta(t) = \\int \\frac{3}{2} dt = \\frac{3}{2}t + C_1\n$$\n$$\nz(t) = \\int 1 dt = t + C_2\n$$\nWe use the initial position $\\gamma(0)=(0,0)$ to determine the constants of integration $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$\n\\theta(0) = \\frac{3}{2}(0) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0\n$$\n$$\nz(0) = (0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0\n$$\nThe unique geodesic satisfying the given initial data is therefore:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}t, t\\right)\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Computation of Arc Length**\n\nThe arc length $S$ of the curve $\\gamma(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=2$ is given by the integral of its speed, $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}\\|_g = \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})}$.\n$$\nS = \\int_{0}^{2} \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))}\\,dt\n$$\nWe have the constant velocity components $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\dot{z}(t) = 1$. The squared speed is:\n$$\ng(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 4\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\dot{z}^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + (1)^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10\n$$\nThe speed is constant along the geodesic: $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}\\|_g = \\sqrt{10}$.\nThe arc length is then:\n$$\nS = \\int_{0}^{2} \\sqrt{10}\\,dt = \\sqrt{10} \\int_{0}^{2} dt = \\sqrt{10}[t]_{0}^{2} = \\sqrt{10}(2-0) = 2\\sqrt{10}\n$$\nThe arc length of this geodesic segment is $2\\sqrt{10}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}\n$$", "id": "3039226"}]}
