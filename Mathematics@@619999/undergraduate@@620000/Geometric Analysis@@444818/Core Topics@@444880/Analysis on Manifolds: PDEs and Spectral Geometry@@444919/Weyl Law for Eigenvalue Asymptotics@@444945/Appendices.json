This serves as a concrete verification of the more general Weyl's law for eigenvalue asymptotics.\n\n- **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is fundamentally sound.

Weyl's law is a celebrated result in geometric analysis.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The eigenvalue problem for the Dirichlet Laplacian on a bounded interval has a discrete spectrum of simple, real, and positive eigenvalues, which can be found explicitly.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds in several steps as outlined by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Solving the Eigenvalue Problem**\nThe eigenvalue problem is given by the second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ -u''(x) = \\lambda u(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,L) $$\nwhich can be rewritten as\n$$ u''(x) + \\lambda u(x) = 0 $$\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$. For a non-trivial solution to exist, we must have $\\lambda>0$. Let $\\lambda = k^2$ for some $k>0$. The general solution to the differential equation is\n$$ u(x) = A \\cos(k x) + B \\sin(k x) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions:\n- At $x=0$: $u(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A$. Since $u(0)=0$, we must have $A=0$.\nThe solution is thus of the form $u(x) = B \\sin(k x)$.\n\n- At $x=L$: $u(L) = B \\sin(k L)$. For a non-trivial solution, we require $B\\neq0$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ \\sin(k L) = 0 $$\nThis condition is satisfied if $kL$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. That is,\n$$ kL = n\\pi \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nSince we assumed $k>0$, and $n=0$ would lead to the trivial solution $u(x)=0$, we must have $n$ be a positive integer, $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\nSolving for $k$, we get the wave numbers $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are then given by $\\lambda = k^2$:\n$$ \\lambda_n = k_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nEach eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$ is simple (has multiplicity $1$). The corresponding eigenfunctions are $u_n(x) = B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Eigenvalue Counting Function $N(\\lambda)$**\nThe eigenvalue counting function $N(\\lambda)$ is defined as the number of eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ such that $\\lambda_n \\le \\lambda$. We need to count the number of positive integers $n$ for which:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\le \\lambda $$\nTaking the square root of both sides (all quantities are positive):\n$$ \\frac{n\\pi}{L} \\le \\sqrt{\\lambda} $$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$ n \\le \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} $$\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, $N(\\lambda)$ is the number of integers in $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ satisfying this inequality. This is precisely the largest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi}$. In terms of the floor function,\n$$ N(\\lambda) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n**3. Finding the Leading-Order Asymptotic of $N(\\lambda)$**\nWe need to find the behavior of $N(\\lambda)$ as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. The floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ satisfies the inequality $x-1  \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le x$. Therefore,\n$$ \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} - 1  N(\\lambda) \\le \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} $$\nFor large $\\lambda$, the term $\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi}$ dominates the constant term $-1$. To find the leading-order asymptotic, we examine the ratio $\\frac{N(\\lambda)}{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi}$ as $\\lambda\\to\\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\lambda\\to\\infty} \\frac{N(\\lambda)}{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi} = \\lim_{\\lambda\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\lfloor L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi \\rfloor}{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi} = 1 $$\nThis means that for large $\\lambda$, $N(\\lambda)$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi}$. We write this as:\n$$ N(\\lambda) \\sim \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\lambda^{1/2} $$\nThe coefficient of the leading-order term is $\\frac{L}{\\pi}$.\n\n**4. Computing the Geometric Constant**\nWeyl's law gives the leading-order asymptotic of $N(\\lambda)$ for the Dirichlet Laplacian on a domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ as:\n$$ N(\\lambda) \\sim \\frac{\\omega_d}{(2\\pi)^d} \\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega) \\lambda^{d/2} $$\nwhere $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega)$ is the volume of the domain $\\Omega$.\n\nIn this problem, the dimension is $d=1$. We need to compute the coefficient $C = (2\\pi)^{-1}\\,\\omega_{1}\\,\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega)$.\n- The unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^1$ is the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |x| \\le 1\\}$, which is the interval $[-1,1]$. Its $1$-dimensional Lebesgue measure (length) is $\\omega_1 = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n- The domain is $\\Omega=(0,L)$. Its $1$-dimensional Lebesgue measure (length) is $\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega) = L-0=L$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the coefficient $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\omega_1 \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot 2 \\cdot L = \\frac{L}{\\pi} $$\n\n**5. Comparison**\nThe coefficient of the leading-order term $\\lambda^{1/2}$ derived from the explicit calculation of eigenvalues is $\\frac{L}{\\pi}$. The geometric constant from the general formula of Weyl's law is also $\\frac{L}{\\pi}$. The two results are identical, which verifies Weyl's law for this elementary case.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the value of the geometric constant $(2\\pi)^{-1}\\,\\omega_{1}\\,\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega)$.

Specifically, an expansion of $\\mathcal{L}\\{N(\\lambda)\\}(t)$ in powers of $t$ (or $\\sqrt{t}$) corresponds to an expansion of $N(\\lambda)$ in powers of $\\lambda$ (or $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$).\n\nWe seek a two-term asymptotic expansion for $N(\\lambda)$ of the form:\n$$\nN(\\lambda) \\sim C_1 \\lambda + C_2 \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\quad \\text{as } \\lambda \\to \\infty\n$$\nLet us compute the Laplace transform of this ansatz. We use the standard formula $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\lambda^{\\alpha}\\}(t) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)}{t^{\\alpha+1}}$ for $\\alpha > -1$.\nFor the first term, with $\\alpha=1$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{C_1 \\lambda\\}(t) = C_1 \\frac{\\Gamma(1+1)}{t^{1+1}} = \\frac{C_1}{t^2}\n$$\nFor the second term, with $\\alpha=1/2$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{C_2 \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\}(t) = C_2 \\mathcal{L}\\{\\lambda^{1/2}\\}(t) = C_2 \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}+1)}{t^{\\frac{1}{2}+1}} = C_2 \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2})}{t^{3/2}} = C_2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2t^{3/2}}\n$$\nCombining these, the Laplace transform of our proposed asymptotic form for $N(\\lambda)$ behaves as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{N(\\lambda)\\}(t) \\sim \\frac{C_1}{t^2} + C_2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2t^{3/2}} \\quad \\text{as } t \\to 0^+\n$$\nComparing this with the expansion derived from the heat trace, we can equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Area}(D)}{4\\pi t^2} - \\frac{\\text{Length}(\\partial D)}{8\\sqrt{\\pi} t^{3/2}} \\sim \\frac{C_1}{t^2} + C_2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2t^{3/2}}\n$$\nEquating the coefficients of the $t^{-2}$ term:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{\\text{Area}(D)}{4\\pi}\n$$\nEquating the coefficients of the $t^{-3/2}$ term:\n$$\nC_2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} = -\\frac{\\text{Length}(\\partial D)}{8\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{\\text{Length}(\\partial D)}{4\\pi}\n$$\nThis justifies the existence of a two-term asymptotic expansion for $N(\\lambda)$ whose coefficients depend on the area and boundary length of the domain:\n$$\nN(\\lambda) \\sim \\frac{\\text{Area}(D)}{4\\pi}\\lambda - \\frac{\\text{Length}(\\partial D)}{4\\pi}\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\quad \\text{as } \\lambda \\to \\infty\n$$\nThe remainder is of order $o(\\sqrt{\\lambda})$, as stated in the problem.\n\nNow, we specialize to the disk $D_R$ of radius $R$. The geometric properties are:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(D_R) = \\pi R^2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Length}(\\partial D_R) = 2\\pi R\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the expressions for the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$:\nThe coefficient of the leading term is:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{\\pi R^2}{4\\pi} = \\frac{R^2}{4}\n$$\nThe coefficient of the second term is:\n$$\nC_2 = -\\frac{2\\pi R}{4\\pi} = -\\frac{R}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the two-term asymptotic expression for the spectral counting function $N(\\lambda)$ for the Dirichlet Laplacian on a disk of radius $R$ is:\n$$\nN(\\lambda) \\sim \\frac{R^2}{4}\\lambda - \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis expression represents the two leading terms of the asymptotic expansion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{R^2}{4}\\lambda - \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\n$$", "id": "3078785"}]}
