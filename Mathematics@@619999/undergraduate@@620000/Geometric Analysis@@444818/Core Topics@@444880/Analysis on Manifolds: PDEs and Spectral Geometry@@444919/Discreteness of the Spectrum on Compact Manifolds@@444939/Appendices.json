The solution simplifies to $u(x) = A \\cosh(kx)$.\nNow, applying the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx}(L) = Ak \\sinh(kL) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $A \\neq 0$. This means we must have $k \\sinh(kL) = 0$. Since $k > 0$ and $L > 0$, the product $kL$ is positive. The hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(z)$, is zero only if $z=0$. As $kL>0$, we have $\\sinh(kL) > 0$. Therefore, the only way for $Ak \\sinh(kL) = 0$ to hold is if $A=0$. This leads to the trivial solution $u(x) = 0$.

The smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$ is the minimum value of this quotient over all admissible non-zero functions $u$ in a suitable space (here, the Sobolev space $H^1([0,L])$):\n$$\n\\lambda_0 = \\min_{u \\in H^1, u \\neq 0} \\frac{\\int_0^L \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 dx}{\\int_0^L u^2 dx}\n$$\nThe numerator, $E_D(u) = \\int_0^L (u')^2 dx$, is the Dirichlet energy of the function $u$.\nSince $(u'(x))^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x$, the Dirichlet energy $E_D(u)$ is always non-negative. The denominator $\\int_0^L u^2 dx$ is strictly positive for a non-zero function $u$. Therefore, the Rayleigh quotient is always non-negative, which implies all eigenvalues must be non-negative, $\\lambda \\ge 0$. This provides a first-principles argument for why there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\nThe minimum value of the Rayleigh quotient, and thus the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$, will be zero if and only if there exists a non-trivial function $u$ (i.e., $u \\not\\equiv 0$) for which the Dirichlet energy is zero.\n$$\nE_D(u) = \\int_0^L (u'(x))^2 dx = 0\n$$\nSince the integrand $(u'(x))^2$ is non-negative and continuous, the integral is zero if and only if the integrand is identically zero, i.e., $u'(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,L]$.\nIntegrating $u'(x)=0$ yields $u(x) = C$ for some constant $C$. For this to be a non-trivial solution, we must have $C \\neq 0$.\nA function $u(x)=C$ with $C \\neq 0$ is a non-zero function in $H^1([0,L])$. We must verify that it satisfies the boundary conditions of the problem. The derivative is $u'(x) = 0$, so:\n$$\nu'(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u'(L) = 0\n$$\nThe constant function satisfies both Neumann boundary conditions. Therefore, there exists a non-trivial function, $u(x)=C$, which is an admissible function for the variational problem and minimizes the Dirichlet energy to zero.\nFor this function, the Rayleigh quotient is:\n$$\n\\lambda_0 = \\frac{\\int_0^L 0^2 dx}{\\int_0^L C^2 dx} = \\frac{0}{C^2L} = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates from first principles that the lowest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_0 = 0$, and its eigenfunctions are the set of non-zero constant functions. The existence of this zero-energy state is directly permitted by the Neumann boundary conditions, which do not constrain the value of the function at the boundary, only its rate of change. In contrast, for Dirichlet boundary conditions ($u(0)=u(L)=0$), a constant function $u(x)=C$ would have to be $C=0$, the trivial solution, and so the lowest eigenvalue would be strictly positive.\n\nThe final expression for the $n$-th eigenvalue, using the standard convention of labeling in increasing order starting from $n=0$, is $\\lambda_n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2}\n$$", "id": "3045895"}, {"introduction": "We now move from one-dimensional manifolds with boundaries to a quintessential example of a two-dimensional compact manifold without a boundary: the flat torus.

A smooth complex-valued function $u$ on $T^{2}$ can be identified with a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that is periodic with period $2\\pi$ in each coordinate variable, $x$ and $y$.

The multiplicity of the eigenvalue $N$ is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to it. The eigenfunctions $\\{ u_{m,n} \\mid m^2+n^2=N \\}$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the multiplicity of $N$ is equal to the number of distinct integer pairs $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $m^2+n^2=N$.

This quantity is given by the number-theoretic function $r_2(N)$. The value of $r_2(N)$ can be determined from the prime factorization of $N$ using a result known as Jacobi's two-square theorem.\n\nLet the prime factorization of $N$ be given by $N = 2^k \\prod_{i} p_i^{a_i} \\prod_{j} q_j^{b_j}$, where each $p_i$ is a distinct prime of the form $4\\ell+1$ and each $q_j$ is a distinct prime of the form $4\\ell+3$.\nThe number of representations of $N$ as a sum of two squares, $r_2(N)$, is zero if any exponent $b_j$ (of a prime congruent to $3$ modulo $4$) is odd.

Its exponent is $a_3 = 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe factorization of $N$ contains no prime factors of the form $4\\ell+3$. This means the condition for a non-zero number of solutions is satisfied (vacuously, as all exponents $b_j$ can be considered to be $0$, which is even).
