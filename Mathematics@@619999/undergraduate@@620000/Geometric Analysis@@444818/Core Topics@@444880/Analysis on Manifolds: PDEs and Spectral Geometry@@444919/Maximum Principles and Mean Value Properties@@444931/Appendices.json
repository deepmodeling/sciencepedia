A point $x = (x_1, x_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ can be represented by polar coordinates $(r, \\phi)$, where $x_1 = r\\cos\\phi$ and $x_2 = r\\sin\\phi$. The Euclidean norm of $x$ is $|x| = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2} = \\sqrt{r^2\\cos^2\\phi + r^2\\sin^2\\phi} = \\sqrt{r^2} = r$, since $r \\ge 0$. The domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ corresponds to $r  0$.\n\nThe function $u$ in polar coordinates becomes $u(r, \\phi) = \\ln(r)$. Note that $u$ is independent of the angular coordinate $\\phi$.\n\nThe Laplace operator, $\\Delta$, in polar coordinates is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2} $$\nA function is harmonic if its Laplacian is zero.

The disk $B_{\\rho}(x_0)$ enclosed by $\\Gamma$ is therefore also in the domain where $u$ is harmonic.\n\nThe mean value property states that the average value of a harmonic function over a circle is equal to its value at the center of the circle.

Thus:\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dr} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r} \\iint_{B_r(x_0)} \\Delta u \\, dA $$\nAs established in part (a), $u$ is harmonic, so $\\Delta u = 0$ everywhere in its domain, which includes the disk $B_r(x_0)$ for any $r \\le \\rho$. Therefore, the integral is zero:\n$$ \\iint_{B_r(x_0)} \\Delta u \\, dA = \\iint_{B_r(x_0)} 0 \\, dA = 0 $$\nThis implies that $\\frac{dm}{dr} = 0$ for all $r \\in (0, \\rho]$.

The average value of $u$ on $\\Gamma$ is equal to its value at the center $x_0$.\n\nNow, we compute this value. The center is $x_0 = (2,0)$. The function is $u(x) = \\ln|x|$.\n$$ u(x_0) = u((2,0)) = \\ln|(2,0)| $$\nThe Euclidean norm of $x_0$ is $|(2,0)| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nTherefore, the average value is:\n$$ u(x_0) = \\ln(2) $$\nThe value of the integral is $\\ln(2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\ln(2)}\n$$", "id": "3056466"}, {"introduction": "A direct and profound consequence of the mean value property is the maximum principle, which dictates that a nonconstant harmonic function must attain its maximum on the boundary of its domain.

It is a valid and instructive exercise in analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Justification and Explanation**\n\nFirst, we justify the claims about the function $u(x,y) = x$.\n1.  **Harmonicity**: To verify that $u(x,y) = x$ is harmonic, we compute its Laplacian, $\\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$. The partial derivatives are:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\n    Therefore, the Laplacian is $\\Delta u = 0 + 0 = 0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and thus for all $(x,y) \\in \\Omega$. Since $u$ is a polynomial, it is in $C^{\\infty}(\\Omega) \\subset C^{2}(\\Omega)$. Hence, $u(x,y) = x$ is a harmonic function in $\\Omega$.\n\n2.  **Sign Change**: The domain $\\Omega = B_{1}(0)$ is the set of points $(x,y)$ such that $x^2 + y^2  1$. This domain contains points with positive $x$-coordinates and points with negative $x$-coordinates. For instance, the point $(1/2, 0) \\in \\Omega$ and $u(1/2, 0) = 1/2  0$. The point $(-1/2, 0) \\in \\Omega$ and $u(-1/2, 0) = -1/2  0$. Thus, the function $u$ changes sign in $\\Omega$.\n\nNow, we explain why a comparison inequality of the form $u(x_{t}) \\leq C\\,u(y_{t})$ with a constant $C0$ must fail.\nFor a fixed $t \\in (0,1)$, the points are $x_{t} = (t,0)$ and $y_{t} = (-t,0)$. We evaluate the function $u$ at these points:\n$$ u(x_{t}) = u(t,0) = t $$\n$$ u(y_{t}) = u(-t,0) = -t $$\nThe proposed inequality is $u(x_{t}) \\leq C\\,u(y_{t})$, which becomes:\n$$ t \\leq C(-t) $$\nWe are given that $t \\in (0,1)$, so $t$ is a strictly positive number. We are also given that the constant $C$ must be strictly positive, $C0$.\nThe left-hand side of the inequality, $t$, is positive.\nThe right-hand side of the inequality, $C(-t)$, is the product of a positive number ($C$) and a negative number ($-t$). The result is therefore a strictly negative number.\nThe inequality $t \\leq C(-t)$ thus asserts that a strictly positive number is less than or equal to a strictly negative number. This is a fundamental contradiction. Consequently, no such constant $C0$ can exist.\n\nThe logical role of the sign of $u$ is crucial. The core principle underlying Harnack's inequality and related comparison results for harmonic functions is the **positivity** of the function. These principles, which are consequences of the maximum principle, essentially state that the values of a positive harmonic function on a compact set are comparable up to a multiplicative constant. For instance, $v(p) \\leq C v(q)$ for points $p, q$ in a compact set and $v0$. When $v0$, both $v(p)$ and $v(q)$ are positive, and the inequality is a meaningful comparison of their magnitudes.\nIn this problem, the function $u$ violates the positivity requirement. By choosing points $x_t$ and $y_t$ where $u$ has opposite signs, we highlight the failure. The inequality $u(x_t) \\leq C u(y_t)$ with $C0$ is not a comparison of magnitudes but an ordering relationship between a positive number and a negative one. The structure of the real number line makes it impossible for a positive number to be less than or equal to a negative one. This counterexample demonstrates that positivity is not merely a technical assumption but an essential ingredient for any Harnack-type comparison principle.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $C_{t}^{\\star}$**\n\nThe extremal comparison constant is defined as:\n$$ C_{t}^{\\star} \\coloneqq \\sup\\left\\{\\, C \\in \\mathbb{R} \\,:\\, u(x_{t}) \\leq C\\,u(y_{t}) \\,\\right\\} $$\nNotice that in this definition, the constraint $C0$ is removed; $C$ can be any real number.\nAs before, the inequality is $t \\leq C(-t)$. We need to find the set of all $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy this for a given $t \\in (0,1)$.\nSince $t \\in (0,1)$, $t$ is positive. This means $-t$ is negative. To isolate $C$, we must divide the inequality by $-t$. When dividing an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality symbol must be reversed:\n$$ \\frac{t}{-t} \\geq \\frac{C(-t)}{-t} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ -1 \\geq C $$\nOr equivalently, $C \\leq -1$.\nThis condition is independent of the specific value of $t \\in (0,1)$.
