Let $\\Omega^k(M)$ be the space of differential $k$-forms on $M$. The codifferential $\\delta: \\Omega^k(M) \\to \\Omega^{k-1}(M)$ is defined as the formal adjoint of the exterior derivative $d: \\Omega^{k-1}(M) \\to \\Omega^k(M)$ with respect to the global $L^2$ inner product. This inner product is defined for any two forms $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\Omega^k(M)$, at least one of which has compact support, by\n$$\n\\langle\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle\\rangle = \\int_M \\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_x \\, dV_g\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_x$ is the pointwise inner product on forms induced by the metric $g$, and $dV_g$ is the Riemannian volume form.

Let $\\left(x^1, \\dots, x^n\\right)$ be a local coordinate system. A $k$-form $\\omega$ can be written as $\\omega = \\frac{1}{k!} \\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_k} dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{i_k}$, where we use the Einstein summation convention. The components $\\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_k}$ are skew-symmetric in their indices. The pointwise inner product is given by $\\langle \\omega, \\zeta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k!} \\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_k} \\zeta^{i_1 \\dots i_k}$, where indices are raised using the inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$. The volume form is $dV_g = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$, which we denote as $\\sqrt{g} \\, d^n x$.\n\nThe components of $d\\eta$ for $\\eta \\in \\Omega^{k-1}(M)$ are given by\n$$\n(d\\eta)_{i_1 \\dots i_k} = \\sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{j-1} \\nabla_{i_j} \\eta_{i_1 \\dots \\hat{i_j} \\dots i_k}\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_i$ denotes the covariant derivative with respect to $\\partial/\\partial x^i$, and the hat denotes omission of an index.\n\nThe left-hand side of the adjoint definition is:\n$$\n\\langle\\langle d\\eta, \\omega \\rangle\\rangle = \\int_M \\langle d\\eta, \\omega \\rangle_x \\, dV_g = \\int_M \\frac{1}{k!} (d\\eta)_{i_1 \\dots i_k} \\omega^{i_1 \\dots i_k} \\sqrt{g} \\, d^n x\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $(d\\eta)_{i_1 \\dots i_k}$ and using the total skew-symmetry of $\\omega^{i_1 \\dots i_k}$:\n$$\n\\langle\\langle d\\eta, \\omega \\rangle\\rangle = \\int_M \\frac{1}{k!} \\left( k \\nabla_{i_1} \\eta_{i_2 \\dots i_k} \\right) \\omega^{i_1 \\dots i_k} \\sqrt{g} \\, d^n x = \\int_M \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} (\\nabla_{i_1} \\eta_{i_2 \\dots i_k}) \\omega^{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_k} \\sqrt{g} \\, d^n x\n$$\nWe now use the covariant divergence theorem (integration by parts). For a compactly supported tensor field $U$ and any tensor field $T$, we have $\\int_M (\\nabla_i U_{\\dots}) T^{i\\dots} dV_g = - \\int_M U_{\\dots} (\\nabla_i T^{i\\dots}) dV_g$. This holds because $\\nabla$ is compatible with the metric $g$, which implies $\\nabla_i dV_g = 0$.\nApplying this to our integral, we set $U_{i_2 \\dots i_k} = \\eta_{i_2 \\dots i_k}$ and move the covariant derivative:\n$$\n\\langle\\langle d\\eta, \\omega \\rangle\\rangle = - \\int_M \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} \\eta_{i_2 \\dots i_k} (\\nabla_{i_1} \\omega^{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_k}) \\sqrt{g} \\, d^n x\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the adjoint definition is:\n$$\n\\langle\\langle \\eta, \\delta\\omega \\rangle\\rangle = \\int_M \\langle \\eta, \\delta\\omega \\rangle_x \\, dV_g = \\int_M \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} \\eta_{i_2 \\dots i_k} (\\delta\\omega)^{i_2 \\dots i_k} \\sqrt{g} \\, d^n x\n$$\nBy comparing the two expressions, since $\\eta$ is arbitrary, we can identify the components of $\\delta\\omega$:\n$$\n(\\delta\\omega)^{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = - \\nabla_i \\omega^{i j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}}\n$$\nLowering the indices, the covariant components of $\\delta\\omega$ are:\n$$\n(\\delta\\omega)_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = - g_{j_1 l_1} \\dots g_{j_{k-1} l_{k-1}} \\nabla_m \\omega^{m l_1 \\dots l_{k-1}} = - \\nabla_m \\omega^m_{\\ j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega^m_{\\ j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = g^{mi} \\omega_{i j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}}$. This gives the explicit component expression for $\\delta\\omega$.\n\nThis expression is manifestly tensorial. The covariant derivative of a tensor is a tensor, and tensor contraction is a coordinate-invariant operation. Thus, the resulting quantity $(\\delta\\omega)_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}}$ transforms as the components of a $(k-1)$-form under a change of coordinates, establishing its tensorial nature.\n\nNow, we derive the operator expression for $\\delta$ in terms of $\\nabla$ and the interior product $i$. Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a local orthonormal frame for $TM$, so $g(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. In such a frame, raising and lowering indices is trivial (e.g., $\\omega^i = \\omega_i$). The component expression for $\\delta\\omega$ simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\delta\\omega)_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla_i \\omega_{i j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}}\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_i$ is the covariant derivative in the direction $e_i$. This is the negative of the trace of the first two indices of the $(k+1)$-tensor $\\nabla\\omega$.\n\nLet's analyze the operator $A = - \\sum_{i=1}^n i_{e_i} \\nabla_{e_i}$. We compute the components of $A\\omega$. The operator $\\nabla_{e_i}$ maps a $k$-form $\\omega$ to another $k$-form $\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega$. The interior product $i_{e_i}$ then maps this to a $(k-1)$-form.\nThe components of a $(k-1)$-form $\\alpha$ in an orthonormal frame are given by $\\alpha_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = \\alpha(e_{j_1}, \\dots, e_{j_{k-1}})$.\nFor the form $i_{e_i}(\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega)$, its components are:\n$$\n(i_{e_i}(\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega))_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = (\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega)(e_i, e_{j_1}, \\dots, e_{j_{k-1}}) = (\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega)_{i j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}}\n$$\nThe components of $\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega$ are related to the covariant derivatives of the components of $\\omega$. For a torsion-free connection $\\nabla$, we have the general formula:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{X} \\alpha)(Y_1, \\dots, Y_k) = X(\\alpha(Y_1, \\dots, Y_k)) - \\sum_{j=1}^k \\alpha(Y_1, \\dots, \\nabla_X Y_j, \\dots, Y_k)\n$$\nTo simplify calculations, we can choose a specific orthonormal frame at a point $p$, namely a geodesic normal frame, where $\\nabla_{e_i} e_j |_p = 0$. At this point $p$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega)_{j_1 \\dots j_k}|_p = e_i(\\omega(e_{j_1}, \\dots, e_{j_k}))|_p = (\\nabla_i \\omega_{j_1 \\dots j_k})|_p\n$$\nTherefore, the components of $A\\omega$ at $p$ are:\n$$\n(A\\omega)_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = - \\sum_{i=1}^n (i_{e_i}\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega)_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = - \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\nabla_{e_i}\\omega)_{i j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}} = - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla_i \\omega_{i j_1 \\dots j_{k-1}}\n$$\nThis matches exactly the component expression for $\\delta\\omega$ we derived earlier. Since both $A\\omega$ and $\\delta\\omega$ are tensors and their components agree in a geodesic normal frame, they must be equal as tensors everywhere. Thus, the operator identity $\\delta = A$ is established.\n\nFinally, we must show that the expression $\\sum_{i=1}^n i_{e_i} \\nabla_{e_i}$ is independent of the choice of local orthonormal frame. Let $\\{f_a\\}_{a=1}^n$ be another local orthonormal frame related to $\\{e_i\\}$ by a matrix of functions $A(x)$, i.e., $f_a = \\sum_i A_{ai} e_i$, where $A(x)$ is in the orthogonal group $O(n)$ for each $x$. Then:\n$$\n\\sum_{a=1}^n i_{f_a} \\nabla_{f_a} = \\sum_{a=1}^n i_{\\sum_i A_{ai} e_i} \\nabla_{\\sum_j A_{aj} e_j}\n$$\nUsing the linearity of $i_X$ and $\\nabla_X$ in the vector field argument $X$:\n$$\n= \\sum_{a=1}^n \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n A_{ai} i_{e_i}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{aj} \\nabla_{e_j}\\right) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\left(\\sum_{a=1}^n A_{ai} A_{aj}\\right) i_{e_i} \\nabla_{e_j}\n$$\nSince $A$ is an orthogonal matrix, $\\sum_{a=1}^n A_{ai} A_{aj} = \\sum_{a=1}^n (A^T)_{ia} A_{aj} = (A^T A)_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n= \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\delta_{ij} \\, i_{e_i} \\nabla_{e_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^n i_{e_i} \\nabla_{e_i}\n$$\nThis confirms that the expression is invariant under a change of local orthonormal frames, and thus represents a well-defined operator on the manifold. The expression implicitly defines a trace operation.\nTherefore, the explicit operator expression for $\\delta$ is $\\delta = - \\sum_{i=1}^n i_{e_i} \\nabla_{e_i}$, where $\\{e_i\\}$ is any local orthonormal frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\delta = - \\sum_{i=1}^n i_{e_i} \\nabla_{e_i}}$$", "id": "3070264"}, {"introduction": "This practice transitions from local operator identities to global analysis on a canonical example: the flat $n$-torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$.

Let $I = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the ordered multi-index corresponding to the form $\\alpha=dx^I = dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{i_k}$.\n\n**1. The Hodge Star Operator**\n\nThe Hodge star operator $*: \\Omega^k(\\mathbb{T}^n) \\to \\Omega^{n-k}(\\mathbb{T}^n)$ is defined with respect to the metric and orientation. For an orthonormal basis $\\{dx^1, \\dots, dx^n\\}$, it is defined by the relation $\\eta \\wedge * \\zeta = \\langle \\eta, \\zeta \\rangle_{\\Lambda^k} \\mathrm{vol}$ for any $k$-forms $\\eta, \\zeta$. The volume form is $\\mathrm{vol} = dx^1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^n$. The inner product on simple forms is given by $\\langle dx^I, dx^J \\rangle = \\delta_{IJ}$.\n\nLet $\\alpha = dx^I$. We seek $*\\alpha$. Let $J = \\{j_1, \\dots, j_{n-k}\\}$ be the ordered multi-index complementary to $I$ in $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. We posit that $*\\alpha$ is proportional to $dx^J$. For $\\eta = \\alpha$, the defining relation becomes $\\alpha \\wedge * \\alpha = \\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}$. Since the basis is orthonormal, $\\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle = 1$. Thus, $\\alpha \\wedge * \\alpha = \\mathrm{vol}$.\n\nLet's test $*\\alpha = \\text{sgn}(I,J) dx^J$, where $\\text{sgn}(I,J)$ is the sign of the permutation that reorders the concatenated sequence $(i_1, \\dots, i_k, j_1, \\dots, j_{n-k})$ to $(1, \\dots, n)$.\nThen $\\alpha \\wedge (\\text{sgn}(I,J) dx^J) = \\text{sgn}(I,J) (dx^I \\wedge dx^J)$. By definition of the sign, $dx^I \\wedge dx^J = \\text{sgn}(I,J) \\mathrm{vol}$.\nSo, $\\alpha \\wedge (\\text{sgn}(I,J) dx^J) = \\text{sgn}(I,J)^2 \\mathrm{vol} = \\mathrm{vol}$. This satisfies the defining property.\nTherefore, $* (dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{i_k}) = \\text{sgn}(I,J) dx^{j_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{j_{n-k}}$.\n\n**2. Computation of $d\\,\\omega_{m}$ and $\\delta\\,\\omega_{m}$**\n\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega_m = f_m \\alpha$. Using the graded Leibniz rule for $d$:\n$d\\omega_m = d(f_m \\alpha) = df_m \\wedge \\alpha + f_m d(\\alpha)$.\nSince $\\alpha$ is a form with constant coefficients, $d\\alpha=0$.\nWe compute $df_m$:\n$$df_m = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x^j} dx^j = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\exp\\left(2\\pi i \\sum_{l=1}^n m_l x^l\\right) dx^j = \\sum_{j=1}^n (2\\pi i \\, m_j) f_m dx^j = (2\\pi i) f_m \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j dx^j.$$\nThus,\n$$d\\omega_m = df_m \\wedge \\alpha = \\left( (2\\pi i) f_m \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j dx^j \\right) \\wedge \\alpha = (2\\pi i) f_m \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j (dx^j \\wedge \\alpha).$$\nThe term $dx^j \\wedge \\alpha$ is non-zero only if $j \\notin I$.\n\nNext, we compute the codifferential $\\delta\\omega_m$. For a $k$-form $\\eta = \\sum_K \\eta_K dx^K$ in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (and hence on the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$), the codifferential is given by the formula\n$$(\\delta\\eta)_J = - \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\eta_{jJ}}{\\partial x^j},$$\nwhere $J$ is an ordered $(k-1)$-multi-index and $jJ$ denotes the ordered $k$-multi-index formed by prepending $j$.\nFor $\\omega_m = f_m \\alpha$, the only non-zero component is $\\omega_I = f_m$.\nLet $J$ be a $(k-1)$-multi-index. $(\\delta\\omega_m)_J$ is non-zero only if $J$ can be extended to $I$ by prepending an index. This is only possible if $J$ is obtained by removing one index from $I$. Let $J_p = I \\setminus \\{i_p\\} = \\{i_1, \\dots, \\widehat{i_p}, \\dots, i_k\\}$. The only non-zero term in the sum for $(\\delta\\omega_m)_{J_p}$ is for $j=i_p$.\nThe component $\\omega_{i_p J_p}$ corresponds to the form $dx^{i_p} \\wedge dx^{J_p}$. We have $dx^{i_p} \\wedge dx^{J_p} = (-1)^{p-1} dx^I$. Thus, the component is $\\omega_{i_p J_p} = (-1)^{p-1} \\omega_I = (-1)^{p-1} f_m$.\nNow we compute the component of the codifferential:\n$$(\\delta\\omega_m)_{J_p} = - \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{i_p J_p}}{\\partial x^{i_p}} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i_p}} ((-1)^{p-1} f_m) = -(-1)^{p-1} (2\\pi i \\, m_{i_p}) f_m.$$\nReconstructing the full form $\\delta\\omega_m$:\n$$\\delta\\omega_m = \\sum_{p=1}^k (\\delta\\omega_m)_{J_p} dx^{J_p} = - (2\\pi i) f_m \\sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{p-1} m_{i_p} dx^{J_p}.$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta \\omega_m$**\n\nThe Hodge Laplacian is $\\Delta = d\\delta + \\delta d$. We compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: $d\\delta\\omega_m$.\n$$d\\delta\\omega_m = d\\left(- (2\\pi i) f_m \\sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{p-1} m_{i_p} dx^{J_p}\\right).$$\nApplying $d$ and noting that $m_{i_p}$ and $dx^{J_p}$ are constant:\n$$d\\delta\\omega_m = - (2\\pi i) df_m \\wedge \\left(\\sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{p-1} m_{i_p} dx^{J_p}\\right).$$\nSubstitute $df_m = (2\\pi i) f_m \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j dx^j$:\n$$d\\delta\\omega_m = - (2\\pi i)^2 f_m \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n m_j dx^j\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{p-1} m_{i_p} dx^{J_p}\\right).$$\n$$d\\delta\\omega_m = 4\\pi^2 f_m \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{p-1} m_j m_{i_p} (dx^j \\wedge dx^{J_p}).$$\nA term $dx^j \\wedge dx^{J_p}$ results in a $k$-form. For this to be proportional to $\\alpha = dx^I$, we must have $j \\in I$. Since $J_p = I\\setminus\\{i_p\\}$, this requires $j=i_p$. Any other $j \\in I$ would be in $J_p$ as well, making the wedge product zero. So, for the component parallel to $\\alpha$:\n$dx^{i_p} \\wedge dx^{J_p} = dx^{i_p} \\wedge (dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\widehat{dx^{i_p}} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{i_k}) = (-1)^{p-1} dx^I = (-1)^{p-1}\\alpha$.\nThe part of $d\\delta\\omega_m$ parallel to $\\alpha$ is:\n$$(d\\delta\\omega_m)_\\parallel = 4\\pi^2 f_m \\sum_{p=1}^k m_{i_p} m_{i_p} ((-1)^{p-1})^2 \\alpha = 4\\pi^2 \\left(\\sum_{p=1}^k m_{i_p}^2\\right) f_m \\alpha = 4\\pi^2 \\left(\\sum_{j \\in I} m_j^2\\right) \\omega_m.$$\n\nSecond term: $\\delta d\\omega_m$.\n$$d\\omega_m = (2\\pi i) f_m \\sum_{j \\notin I} m_j (dx^j \\wedge \\alpha).$$\nLet $\\beta_j = dx^j \\wedge \\alpha$. This is a constant $(k+1)$-form. So $d\\omega_m = (2\\pi i) \\sum_{j \\notin I} m_j f_m \\beta_j$.\n$$\\delta d\\omega_m = (2\\pi i) \\sum_{j \\notin I} m_j \\delta(f_m \\beta_j).$$\nUsing our formula for $\\delta(f\\eta)$, where $\\eta$ is a constant form, on each term $f_m \\beta_j$, the result is a $k$-form. We are interested in the component parallel to $\\alpha=dx^I$. A term $\\delta(f_m \\beta_j)$ will have a component parallel to $\\alpha$ only if one of the basis forms in its expansion is $\\alpha$. This occurs when we remove the index $j$ from the multi-index of $\\beta_j$.\nThe multi-index for $\\beta_j$ is $\\{j\\} \\cup I$. Removing $j$ leaves $I$. Let's say $j$ would be at position $s+1$ in the ordered index for $\\beta_j$. The formula for $\\delta$ gives a term proportional to $m_j$.\nThe calculation yields:\n$$(\\delta (f_m \\beta_j))_\\parallel = - (-1)^{s} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}((-1)^s (f_m (\\beta_j)_{\\{j\\}\\cup I})) \\alpha = - (2\\pi i m_j) f_m \\alpha.$$\nThus,\n$$\\delta d\\omega_m = (2\\pi i) \\sum_{j \\notin I} m_j (-(2\\pi i m_j) f_m \\alpha + \\text{orthogonal terms}).$$\nThe part of $\\delta d\\omega_m$ parallel to $\\alpha$:\n$$(\\delta d\\omega_m)_\\parallel = \\sum_{j \\notin I} (2\\pi i)m_j (-2\\pi i m_j) f_m \\alpha = 4\\pi^2 \\left(\\sum_{j \\notin I} m_j^2\\right) f_m \\alpha = 4\\pi^2 \\left(\\sum_{j \\notin I} m_j^2\\right) \\omega_m.$$\nA more detailed calculation, as demonstrated in the validation phase, confirms that the components of $d\\delta\\omega_m$ and $\\delta d\\omega_m$ orthogonal to $\\alpha$ cancel each other out.\nSumming the parallel components:\n$$\\Delta\\omega_m = (d\\delta\\omega_m)_\\parallel + (\\delta d\\omega_m)_\\parallel = 4\\pi^2 \\left(\\sum_{j \\in I} m_j^2 + \\sum_{j \\notin I} m_j^2\\right) \\omega_m = 4\\pi^2 \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n m_j^2\\right) \\omega_m.$$\nSo, $\\Delta \\omega_m = (4\\pi^2 |m|^2) \\omega_m$, where $|m|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j^2$.\nThe form $\\omega_m$ is an eigenform of the Hodge Laplacian with eigenvalue $\\lambda(m) = 4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j^2$.\n\n**4. Harmonic Forms**\nA form $\\omega$ is harmonic if $\\Delta\\omega=0$. For $\\omega_m$, this means $\\lambda(m) \\omega_m = 0$. Since $\\omega_m$ is not identically zero (unless $f_m$ is, which we don't consider), this requires $\\lambda(m)=0$.\n$$\\lambda(m) = 4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j^2 = 0.$$\nSince $m_j$ are integers, $m_j^2 \\ge 0$. The sum is zero if and only if $m_j^2 = 0$ for all $j=1, \\dots, n$. This means $m_j=0$ for all $j$.\nThis corresponds to the \"constant Fourier mode\" where $m = (0, \\dots, 0)$. In this case, $f_0(x) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\nThe harmonic forms of this type are $\\omega_0 = 1 \\cdot \\alpha = \\alpha$. These are the constant $k$-forms on the torus.\nFor such forms, $d\\omega_0=d\\alpha=0$ and $\\delta\\omega_0=\\delta\\alpha=0$, hence $\\Delta \\omega_0 = (d\\delta+\\delta d)\\alpha = 0$, confirming they are harmonic. All other forms $\\omega_m$ with $m \\neq 0$ are not harmonic.\n\nThe final answer is the expression for the eigenvalue $\\lambda(m)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j^2}\n$$", "id": "3070273"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores the profound connection between the Hodge Laplacian and the topology of the underlying space.

All terms are standard: Hodge Laplacian, codifferential, absolute boundary conditions, and differential forms.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly grounded in differential geometry. No scientific or factual unsoundness is present.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem concerns a linear elliptic partial differential equation ($\\Delta\\omega=0$) on a bounded domain with well-defined boundary conditions. The Hodge decomposition theorem for manifolds with boundary ensures the existence and uniqueness of solutions under such conditions. The normalization condition serves to specify a unique solution from the space of harmonic forms.\n-   **Consistency**: A crucial observation is the strong normalization condition: $\\int_{C_{\\rho}}\\omega=1$ for all $\\rho \\in (a,b)$. Let $\\rho_1, \\rho_2$ be two radii such that $a < \\rho_1 < \\rho_2 < b$. Let $A'$ be the annulus between the circles $C_{\\rho_1}$ and $C_{\\rho_2}$. By Stokes' theorem, $\\int_{A'} d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial A'} \\omega = \\int_{C_{\\rho_2}} \\omega - \\int_{C_{\\rho_1}} \\omega$. The normalization condition implies this difference is $1-1=0$. Since this holds for any sub-annulus $A'$, it implies that the $2$-form $d\\omega$ must be identically zero throughout $A$. Therefore, the condition implies that $\\omega$ is a closed form, i.e., $d\\omega=0$. This is a consistent deduction that simplifies the problem.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe are looking for a $1$-form $\\omega$ on the annulus $A$ satisfying $\\Delta\\omega=0$, absolute boundary conditions, and a circulation normalization.\n\nAs established during validation, the condition $\\int_{C_{\\rho}}\\omega=1$ for all $\\rho \\in (a,b)$ implies that $\\omega$ must be a closed form, i.e., $d\\omega=0$.\n\nWith $d\\omega=0$, the Hodge-Laplace equation $\\Delta\\omega = (d\\delta+\\delta d)\\omega = 0$ simplifies to $d(\\delta\\omega)=0$. This means the $0$-form $\\delta\\omega$ is a closed function. Since the annulus $A$ is a connected domain, $\\delta\\omega$ must be a constant function, say $\\delta\\omega=C$.\n\nThe absolute boundary conditions are $\\iota_{\\nu}\\omega=0$ and $\\iota_{\\nu}(d\\omega)=0$. Since $d\\omega=0$, the second condition $\\iota_{\\nu}(0)=0$ is trivially satisfied. We only need to enforce $\\iota_{\\nu}\\omega=0$ on $\\partial A$.\n\nWe work in polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$. The Euclidean metric is $ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2$. A general $1$-form can be written as $\\omega = f(r,\\theta)dr + g(r,\\theta)d\\theta$. The domain $A$ and the conditions are rotationally invariant, which suggests looking for a solution where $f$ and $g$ depend only on $r$. Let $\\omega = f(r)dr + g(r)d\\theta$.\n\n1.  **Condition $d\\omega=0$**:\n    $d\\omega = d(f(r)dr + g(r)d\\theta) = (\\frac{\\partial g(r)}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial f(r)}{\\partial \\theta}) dr \\wedge d\\theta = (\\frac{dg}{dr} - 0) dr \\wedge d\\theta$.\n    For $d\\omega=0$, we must have $\\frac{dg}{dr}=0$, which implies $g(r)$ is a constant, say $g_0$.\n    So, $\\omega = f(r)dr + g_0 d\\theta$.\n\n2.  **Boundary Condition $\\iota_{\\nu}\\omega=0$**:\n    The boundary $\\partial A$ consists of the circles $r=a$ and $r=b$.\n    -   At $r=b$, the outward unit normal vector is $\\nu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$. The condition is $\\iota_{\\partial/\\partial r}\\omega = \\omega(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) = f(b) = 0$.\n    -   At $r=a$, the outward unit normal vector is $\\nu = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$. The condition is $\\iota_{-\\partial/\\partial r}\\omega = \\omega(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) = -f(a) = 0$, so $f(a)=0$.\n\n3.  **Condition $\\delta\\omega=C$**:\n    First, we compute the codifferential $\\delta = -\\star d \\star$ on $\\omega = f(r)dr + g_0 d\\theta$. The Hodge star operator on $1$-forms in polar coordinates acts as $\\star dr = r d\\theta$ and $\\star d\\theta = -dr/r$.\n    $\\star\\omega = \\star(f(r)dr + g_0 d\\theta) = f(r)(r d\\theta) + g_0(-dr/r) = -\\frac{g_0}{r}dr + r f(r) d\\theta$.\n    $d(\\star\\omega) = d(-\\frac{g_0}{r}dr + r f(r) d\\theta) = [\\frac{\\partial(r f(r))}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial(-g_0/r)}{\\partial \\theta}] dr \\wedge d\\theta = \\frac{d(r f(r))}{dr} dr \\wedge d\\theta$.\n    The volume form is $r dr \\wedge d\\theta$, so $\\star(h dr \\wedge d\\theta) = h/r$ for a function $h$.\n    $\\delta\\omega = -\\star(d(\\star\\omega)) = -\\star(\\frac{d(rf)}{dr} dr \\wedge d\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d(rf)}{dr}$.\n    The condition $\\delta\\omega = C$ becomes $\\frac{d(rf)}{dr} = -Cr$.\n    Integrating with respect to $r$ yields $r f(r) = -\\frac{C}{2}r^2 + D_1$, where $D_1$ is a constant.\n    Thus, $f(r) = -\\frac{C}{2}r + \\frac{D_1}{r}$.\n    Now, applying the boundary conditions $f(a)=0$ and $f(b)=0$:\n    -   $-\\frac{C}{2}a + \\frac{D_1}{a} = 0 \\implies D_1 = \\frac{C}{2}a^2$.\n    -   $-\\frac{C}{2}b + \\frac{D_1}{b} = 0 \\implies D_1 = \\frac{C}{2}b^2$.\n    Since $0 < a < b$, the only way for $\\frac{C}{2}a^2 = \\frac{C}{2}b^2$ to hold is if $C=0$. This in turn implies $D_1=0$.\n    Therefore, $f(r)=0$ for all $r \\in [a,b]$, and also $\\delta\\omega=0$.\n\n4.  **Final Form and Normalization**:\n    The conditions so far force the solution to have the form $\\omega = g_0 d\\theta$ for some constant $g_0$. This form is both closed ($d\\omega=0$) and co-closed ($\\delta\\omega=0$), making it a harmonic form.\n    We apply the final condition, the circulation normalization:\n    $$ \\int_{C_{\\rho}}\\omega = 1 $$\n    For a circle $C_{\\rho}$ of radius $\\rho$, parameterized by $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$:\n    $$ \\int_{C_{\\rho}} g_0 d\\theta = g_0 \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi g_0 $$\n    Setting this equal to $1$ gives $2\\pi g_0 = 1$, so $g_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$.\n    The unique $1$-form satisfying all conditions is $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}d\\theta$.\n\n### Potential Theory Interpretation\n\nThe problem asks for an interpretation in terms of local harmonic potentials $u$ and $v$.\n\n-   **Potential for $\\omega$**:\n    Since $\\omega$ is closed ($d\\omega=0$), it is locally exact by the Poincaré lemma. We seek a scalar potential $u$ such that locally $\\omega = du$.\n    $$ du = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}d\\theta $$\n    A solution is $u(r,\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\theta$. This potential $u$ is a harmonic function, as $\\Delta_0 u = (\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2})(\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\theta) = 0$.\n\n-   **Potential for $\\star\\omega$**:\n    The Hodge dual of $\\omega$ is $\\star\\omega = \\star(\\frac{1}{2\\pi}d\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\star(d\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}(-\\frac{dr}{r}) = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi r}dr$.\n    This is also a closed form. We seek a scalar potential $v$ such that locally $\\star\\omega = dv$.\n    $$ dv = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi r}dr = d(-\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln r) $$\n    A solution is $v(r, \\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\ln r$. This potential $v$ is also harmonic, as $\\Delta_0 v = (\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r \\frac{d}{dr}))(-\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\ln r) = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r \\cdot \\frac{1}{r}) = 0$.\n    The functions $u$ and $v$ are local harmonic potentials as required.\n\n-   **Topological Obstruction**:\n    The potential $u = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\theta$ is not a globally well-defined single-valued function on the entire annulus $A$. If one traverses a closed loop around the central hole (e.g., any $C_{\\rho}$), the angle $\\theta$ increases by $2\\pi$. As a result, the value of $u$ changes by $\\Delta u = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}(2\\pi) = 1$. A globally defined function must return to its starting value after traversing a closed loop.\n    The existence of a closed but not globally exact form is a hallmark of a topologically non-trivial manifold. Specifically, the annulus $A$ is not simply connected; it is homotopy equivalent to a circle $S^1$. Its first de Rham cohomology group $H^1_{dR}(A)$ is non-trivial, $H^1_{dR}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The form $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}d\\theta$ is a representative of a generator of this cohomology group. By de Rham's theorem, a closed form is globally exact if and only if its integrals over all closed loops (its periods) are zero. The integral of $\\omega$ over the non-contractible loop $C_\\rho$ is $1$, which is non-zero. This non-zero period is the topological obstruction that prevents $\\omega$ from being written globally as $du$ for a single-valued function $u$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}d\\theta} $$", "id": "3070267"}]}
