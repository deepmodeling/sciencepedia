For each fixed radius $r$ with $0<r<1$, the functions $u_m(x)=m x_2 + c$ with $m>0$ and $c>0$ are positive weak solutions on $B_r$, yet by choosing $m$ sufficiently close to $c/r$ from below, the ratio $\\sup_{B_r} u_m / \\inf_{B_r} u_m$ becomes arbitrarily large, demonstrating that no uniform Harnack constant can exist when the lower ellipticity bound vanishes on the set $\\{x_1=0\\}$.\n\nB. Even without uniform ellipticity, as long as $A(x)$ is measurable and bounded above, the same Harnack inequality with a universal constant applies to all positive weak solutions in any ball inside $\\Omega$.\n\nC.

In non-divergence form, even without a uniform lower bound on ellipticity, the Krylov–Safonov estimate still provides a Harnack inequality for bounded solutions with constants depending only on the upper bound of the coefficients.\n\nE. If uniform ellipticity fails only on a closed degeneracy set, one can recover a local Harnack inequality on balls $B_r$ that stay a fixed positive distance away from this set (i.e., on regions where a positive lower ellipticity bound does hold), with constants depending on that lower bound and the distance to the degeneracy set.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The Harnack inequality is a cornerstone of regularity theory for elliptic PDEs, but its validity hinges on the uniform ellipticity condition, specifically the existence of a uniform lower bound $\\lambda > 0$. When this condition fails, the equation is called degenerate, and the Harnack inequality may not hold with a uniform constant. Let's analyze the given options.\n\n**A.** This option provides a concrete counterexample. The equation is $-\\operatorname{div}(x_1^2 \\nabla u)=0$. The ellipticity matrix is $A(x)=x_1^2 I$, whose eigenvalues are $x_1^2$. The lower bound is not uniform, as it vanishes on the line $\\{x_1=0\\}$. The functions $u_m(x)=m x_2 + c$ are genuine solutions, as $\\operatorname{div}(x_1^2 \\nabla u_m) = \\operatorname{div}(0, m x_1^2) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}(m x_1^2) = 0$. For $u_m$ to be positive in a ball $B_r$, we need its minimum value $c-mr$ to be positive, so $m  c/r$. The Harnack ratio is $\\frac{\\sup_{B_r} u_m}{\\inf_{B_r} u_m} = \\frac{c+mr}{c-mr}$. As $m$ approaches $c/r$ from below, this ratio clearly goes to infinity. This demonstrates that no single Harnack constant can apply to all positive solutions in a ball that intersects the degeneracy set. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B.** This statement is fundamentally false. It claims the lower ellipticity bound is unnecessary. The proofs of the DGNM theory rely critically on the lower bound $\\lambda > 0$ to control the energy of the solution from below in the Caccioppoli inequality. The counterexample in option A explicitly disproves this claim. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This statement suggests a counterexample using a piecewise constant function that jumps across the degeneracy curve. While the intuition is sound (degeneracy allows for sharp transitions), the proposed solution is not \"valid\" in the standard context. DGNM theory applies to weak solutions in the Sobolev space $H^1_{loc}(\\Omega)$. A function with a jump discontinuity is not in this space, as its weak derivative is a measure, not an $L^2$ function. Therefore, this is not a sound counterexample within the theory's standard framework. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This statement incorrectly describes the Krylov-Safonov theory for non-divergence equations. That theory also requires a uniform lower ellipticity bound $\\lambda > 0$ for its main results, including the Harnack inequality. The claim that it works without a lower bound is false. Furthermore, it shifts the context to non-divergence form equations, which are distinct from the problem's focus. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**E.** This statement correctly describes the local nature of the theory's applicability. If the equation is degenerate only on a set $S$, then on any compact region $K$ at a positive distance from $S$, the equation *is* uniformly elliptic with some local lower bound $\\lambda_K > 0$. Therefore, the standard DGNM theory and the Harnack inequality apply locally within such regions. The constant in this local Harnack inequality will depend on $\\lambda_K$. The failure of a *global* uniform Harnack inequality is explained by the fact that as a region approaches the degeneracy set $S$, the local lower bound $\\lambda_K \\to 0$, causing the Harnack constant to blow up.
