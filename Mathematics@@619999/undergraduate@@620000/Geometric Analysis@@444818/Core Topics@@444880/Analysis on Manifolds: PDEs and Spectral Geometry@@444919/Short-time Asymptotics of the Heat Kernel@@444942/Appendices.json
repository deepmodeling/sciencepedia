For a smooth manifold, the first two coefficients are universal:\n-   $a_0(x) = 1$\n-   $a_1(x) = \\frac{1}{6} R(x)$\n\nwhere $R(x)$ is the scalar curvature at point $x$. This gives the crucial formula for our task:\n$$\nK_t(x,x) \\sim (4\\pi t)^{-n/2}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6} R(x)\\, t + O(t^2)\\right)\n$$\n\n### **2. Discretization using the Finite Element Method**\n\nWe represent the manifold $M$ as a triangular mesh $(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{F})$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the set of vertices $\\{x_i\\}$ and $\\mathcal{F}$ is the set of triangular faces. The heat equation is discretized using the Finite Element Method with linear basis functions. This leads to a system of ordinary differential equations for the heat values $u(t)$ at the vertices:\n$$\nM \\frac{d u(t)}{dt} = -S u(t)\n$$\nHere, $u(t)$ is a vector where $[u(t)]_i$ is the heat value at vertex $x_i$.\n-   The **mass matrix** $M$ is a diagonal matrix where each entry $M_{ii}$ represents the effective area around vertex $x_i$. For the barycentric lumping scheme, $M_{ii}$ is one-third of the sum of the areas of all triangles incident to vertex $x_i$.\n-   The **stiffness matrix** $S$ is a discrete representation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. For a triangular mesh, the most common and geometrically meaningful choice is the **cotangent-weighted Laplacian**. For an edge connecting vertices $x_i$ and $x_j$, the off-diagonal entry is given by:\n    $$\n    S_{ij} = S_{ji} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\cot \\alpha_{ij} + \\cot \\beta_{ij}\\right) \\quad (i \\neq j)\n    $$\n    where $\\alpha_{ij}$ and $\\beta_{ij}$ are the angles opposite to the edge $(i,j)$ in the two triangles that share this edge. The diagonal entries are defined to ensure rows sum to zero: $S_{ii} = -\\sum_{j \\neq i} S_{ij}$.\n\nRearranging the system gives $\\frac{du(t)}{dt} = -M^{-1}S u(t) = -L u(t)$, where $L = M^{-1}S$ is the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator. The formal solution is given by the matrix exponential:\n$$\nu(t) = \\exp(-tL) u(0)\n$$\n\n### **3. Derivation of the Curvature Estimator**\n\nOur goal is to estimate $R(x_i)$ by relating the discrete heat evolution to the continuous asymptotic expansion. We need a discrete analogue of the on-diagonal heat kernel, $K_t(x_i, x_i)$. This corresponds to the heat density at vertex $x_i$ at time $t$, given a unit point source of heat at $x_i$ at time $t=0$.\n\nA discrete unit point source at $x_i$ is an initial condition $u(0)$ such that the total heat is $1$ and is concentrated at $x_i$. The total heat on the mesh is given by $\\sum_j [u(0)]_j M_{jj}$. To place a unit mass at $x_i$, we set $[u(0)]_j = \\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{M_{ii}}$.\n\nThe heat value at vertex $x_i$ at time $t$ is then $[u(t)]_i$. This value represents the heat density, which is our discrete analogue of $K_t(x_i,x_i)$, let's call it $h_t(i)$:\n$$\nh_t(i) = [u(t)]_i = \\left[\\exp(-tL) \\left(\\frac{1}{M_{ii}} e_i\\right)\\right]_i = \\frac{1}{M_{ii}} [\\exp(-tL)]_{ii}\n$$\nwhere $e_i$ is the standard basis vector for vertex $i$.\n\nFor a $2$-dimensional manifold ($n=2$), the continuous expansion is $K_t(x,x) \\sim (4\\pi t)^{-1}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6} R(x) t\\right)$. We can rearrange this to form a linear relationship in $t$:\n$$\n(4\\pi t) K_t(x,x) \\approx 1 + \\left(\\frac{R(x)}{6}\\right) t\n$$\nInspired by this, we define a scaled discrete quantity $\\psi_i(t)$:\n$$\n\\psi_i(t) = 4\\pi t \\, h_t(i) = \\frac{4\\pi t}{M_{ii}} [\\exp(-tL)]_{ii}\n$$\nWe expect that for small $t$, $\\psi_i(t)$ will also behave linearly. However, due to discretization errors, the constant term may not be exactly $1$. We posit the model:\n$$\n\\psi_i(t) \\approx a + b t\n$$\nBy comparing this to the continuous form, we can identify $a$ with a discretization-dependent constant $C$ and $b$ with $C \\cdot \\frac{R(x_i)}{6}$. The ratio $b/a$ cancels the unknown constant $C$:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} \\approx \\frac{C \\cdot R(x_i)/6}{C} = \\frac{R(x_i)}{6}\n$$\nThis gives us a robust estimator for the scalar curvature at vertex $x_i$:\n$$\n\\widehat{R}(x_i) = 6 \\frac{b}{a}\n$$\n\n### **4. Numerical Procedure**\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Given a mesh $(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{F})$, compute the cotangent stiffness matrix $S$ and the diagonal barycentric mass matrix $M$.\n2.  Compute the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator $L = M^{-1}S$.\n3.  Calculate the average edge length $h$ of the mesh. Choose a set of small time values $\\{t_k\\}$, proportional to $h^2$, e.g., $t_k = c_k h^2$ for small constants $c_k$.\n4.  For each time $t_k$, compute the matrix exponential $U_{t_k} = \\exp(-t_k L)$.\n5.  For a chosen vertex $i$, calculate the corresponding sequence of values $\\psi_i(t_k) = \\frac{4\\pi t_k}{M_{ii}} [U_{t_k}]_{ii}$.\n6.  Perform a linear regression on the points $(t_k, \\psi_i(t_k))$ to find the best-fit intercept $a$ and slope $b$.\n7.  Calculate the estimated scalar curvature as $\\widehat{R}(x_i) = 6 \\, b/a$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for the three test cases specified: an octahedron of radius $r=1$ (approximating a sphere with $R=2/r^2=2$), an octahedron of radius $r=2$ (approximating a sphere with $R=2/r^2=0.5$), and a periodic grid on a unit square (approximating a flat torus with $R=0$).", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test cases and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    time_coeffs = np.array([0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12])\n\n    # Test Case 1: Sphere of radius r=1\n    V1, F1 = get_octahedron_mesh(radius=1.0)\n    R1 = estimate_curvature(V1, F1, 0, time_coeffs, periodic_dims=None)\n\n    # Test Case 2: Sphere of radius r=2\n    V2, F2 = get_octahedron_mesh(radius=2.0)\n    R2 = estimate_curvature(V2, F2, 0, time_coeffs, periodic_dims=None)\n\n    # Test Case 3: Flat Torus\n    V3, F3 = get_torus_mesh(N=8)\n    R3 = estimate_curvature(V3, F3, 0, time_coeffs, periodic_dims=[0, 1])\n    \n    results = [R1, R2, R3]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{r:.6f}' for r in results)}]\")\n\ndef get_octahedron_mesh(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates vertices and faces for an octahedron inscribed in a sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    r = float(radius)\n    V = np.array([\n        [r, 0, 0], [-r, 0, 0], [0, r, 0], \n        [0, -r, 0], [0, 0, r], [0, 0, -r]\n    ])\n    F = np.array([\n        [0, 4, 2], [2, 4, 1], [1, 4, 3], [3, 4, 0],\n        [0, 2, 5], [2, 1, 5], [1, 3, 5], [3, 0, 5]\n    ])\n    return V, F\n\ndef get_torus_mesh(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a periodic grid mesh on the unit square.\n    Vertices are arranged row by row.
