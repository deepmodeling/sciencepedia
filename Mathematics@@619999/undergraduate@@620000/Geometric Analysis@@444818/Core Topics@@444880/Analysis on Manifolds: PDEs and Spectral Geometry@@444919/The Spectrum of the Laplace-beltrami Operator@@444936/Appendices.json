The Riemannian metric is given in this coordinate system as $g = d\\theta^2$. This is a one-dimensional manifold, so the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ has a single component, $g_{11} = 1$. The inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$ also has one component, $g^{11} = (g_{11})^{-1} = 1$. The determinant of the metric tensor is $\\det(g) = g_{11} = 1$.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator is defined as $\\Delta f = -\\mathrm{div}(\\nabla f)$. We first find the Riemannian gradient $\\nabla f$ and then the Riemannian divergence $\\mathrm{div}$.\n\nThe **gradient** of a smooth function $f$ is a vector field whose components in local coordinates $x^i$ are given by $(\\nabla f)^i = \\sum_{j} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}$.\nFor $S^1$ with the coordinate $x^1 = \\theta$, we have a single component:\n$$(\\nabla f)^1 = g^{11} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{df}{d\\theta} = \\frac{df}{d\\theta}$$\nThe gradient vector field is therefore $\\nabla f = \\frac{df}{d\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n\nThe **divergence** of a vector field $X$ with local components $X^i$ is defined by the formula $\\mathrm{div}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} (\\sqrt{\\det(g)} X^i)$.\nHere, the vector field is $X = \\nabla f$, with the single component $X^1 = (\\nabla f)^1 = \\frac{df}{d\\theta}$. We also have $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\nThe divergence of the gradient is:\n$$\\mathrm{div}(\\nabla f) = \\frac{1}{1} \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left(1 \\cdot (\\nabla f)^1\\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\frac{df}{d\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{d^2f}{d\\theta^2}$$\n\nFinally, the **Laplace-Beltrami operator** on $S^1$ is:\n$$\\Delta f = -\\mathrm{div}(\\nabla f) = -\\frac{d^2f}{d\\theta^2}$$\n\n### Part 2: The Eigenvalue Problem on $S^1$\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue problem $\\Delta u = \\lambda u$ with periodic boundary conditions $u(\\theta + 2\\pi) = u(\\theta)$ and $u'(\\theta + 2\\pi) = u'(\\theta)$. Using the derived formula for $\\Delta$, the equation becomes:\n$$-\\frac{d^2u}{d\\theta^2} = \\lambda u \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d^2u}{d\\theta^2} + \\lambda u = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. We analyze the solutions based on the sign of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\lambda < 0$**\nLet $\\lambda = -k^2$ for some real $k > 0$. The equation is $u'' - k^2 u = 0$. The general solution is $u(\\theta) = c_1 e^{k\\theta} + c_2 e^{-k\\theta}$. The periodic boundary conditions require $u(0) = u(2\\pi)$ and $u'(0) = u'(2\\pi)$. These conditions lead to a linear system for $c_1$ and $c_2$ whose only solution is $c_1 = c_2 = 0$, giving the trivial solution $u(\\theta) = 0$. Thus, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\n**Case 2: $\\lambda = 0$**\nThe equation becomes $u'' = 0$. The general solution is $u(\\theta) = c_1 \\theta + c_2$. The periodicity condition $u(0) = u(2\\pi)$ implies $c_2 = c_1(2\\pi) + c_2$, which yields $c_1 = 0$. The solution is $u(\\theta) = c_2$, a constant function. These functions are non-trivial for $c_2 \\neq 0$ and satisfy the boundary conditions. The eigenspace for $\\lambda_0 = 0$ is one-dimensional, spanned by the eigenfunction $u_0(\\theta) = 1$.\n\n**Case 3: $\\lambda > 0$**\nLet $\\lambda = k^2$ for some real $k > 0$. The equation is $u'' + k^2 u = 0$. The general solution is $u(\\theta) = c_1 \\cos(k\\theta) + c_2 \\sin(k\\theta)$. The periodic boundary condition $u(\\theta + 2\\pi) = u(\\theta)$ implies that $k$ must be an integer. Let $k = n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\nThe eigenvalues are therefore $\\lambda_n = n^2$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. For each such eigenvalue, the eigenspace is two-dimensional, spanned by the pair of real, orthogonal eigenfunctions $\\{\\cos(n\\theta), \\sin(n\\theta)\\}$. The derivative condition $u'(\\theta+2\\pi) = u'(\\theta)$ is automatically satisfied since the derivatives are also linear combinations of $\\cos(n\\theta)$ and $\\sin(n\\theta)$.\n\nIn summary, a complete set of real eigenfunctions and their corresponding eigenvalues is:\n- $\\lambda_0 = 0$, with eigenfunction $u_0(\\theta) = 1$.\n- $\\lambda_n = n^2$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, with eigenfunctions $\\cos(n\\theta)$ and $\\sin(n\\theta)$.\n\n### Part 3: Computation of the Rayleigh Quotient\n\nThe Rayleigh quotient is given by\n$$ \\mathcal{R}[f] = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla f \\rangle \\, d\\mathrm{vol}}{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f^{2} \\, d\\mathrm{vol}} $$\nThe volume element on $S^1$ is $d\\mathrm{vol} = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} d\\theta = d\\theta$. The inner product in the numerator is $\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla f \\rangle = g(\\nabla f, \\nabla f)$. Since $\\nabla f = \\frac{df}{d\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = g_{11} = 1$, we have $\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla f \\rangle = (\\frac{df}{d\\theta})^2$.\nThe numerator can be related to the Laplacian via integration by parts (Green's first identity). For a closed manifold like $S^1$:\n$$ \\int_{S^1} \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla f \\rangle d\\mathrm{vol} = \\int_{S^1} f (\\Delta f) d\\mathrm{vol} $$\nThe Rayleigh quotient can thus be written as:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}[f] = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f(\\Delta f) \\, d\\mathrm{vol}}{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f^{2} \\, d\\mathrm{vol}} $$\nThis form is particularly useful if $f$ is an eigenfunction of $\\Delta$. If $\\Delta f = \\lambda f$ for some eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}[f] = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f(\\lambda f) \\, d\\mathrm{vol}}{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f^{2} \\, d\\mathrm{vol}} = \\frac{\\lambda \\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f^{2} \\, d\\mathrm{vol}}{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f^{2} \\, d\\mathrm{vol}} = \\lambda $$\n\nWe are asked to compute the quotient for the function $f(\\theta) = \\sin(3\\theta) + 2\\cos(3\\theta)$. This function is a linear combination of the eigenfunctions $\\sin(3\\theta)$ and $\\cos(3\\theta)$. From Part 2, both of these functions belong to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_3 = 3^2 = 9$.\nThe eigenspace associated with an eigenvalue is a vector space. Therefore, any non-zero linear combination of eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue is itself an eigenfunction with that same eigenvalue. Let's verify this for $f(\\theta)$:\n$$ \\Delta f(\\theta) = \\Delta(\\sin(3\\theta) + 2\\cos(3\\theta)) = \\Delta(\\sin(3\\theta)) + 2\\Delta(\\cos(3\\theta)) $$\nSince $\\Delta(\\sin(3\\theta)) = 9 \\sin(3\\theta)$ and $\\Delta(\\cos(3\\theta)) = 9 \\cos(3\\theta)$,\n$$ \\Delta f(\\theta) = 9 \\sin(3\\theta) + 2(9 \\cos(3\\theta)) = 9(\\sin(3\\theta) + 2\\cos(3\\theta)) = 9 f(\\theta) $$\nThe function $f(\\theta)$ is an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator with an eigenvalue of $\\lambda=9$.\nTherefore, the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}[f]$ is equal to this eigenvalue.\n$$ \\mathcal{R}[f] = 9 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "3075347"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the circle, we now turn to a higher-dimensional example that also introduces the crucial role of boundary conditions: a rectangular domain in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.

The condition $u(x,y)=0$ on $\\partial M$ implies:\n- $u(0, y) = X(0)Y(y) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $Y(y)$ cannot be identically zero, so we must have $X(0) = 0$.\n- $u(a, y) = X(a)Y(y) = 0$.

Consequently, no divisor $d$ of $2025$ can be divisible by $2$, and therefore no divisor can be divisible by $4$. The condition $4 \\nmid d$ in Jacobi's formula is thus satisfied for all divisors of $2025$.\n\nThe formula for $r_4(2025)$ simplifies to:\n$$\nr_4(2025) = 8 \\sum_{d|2025} d\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{d|2025} d$ is the sum-of-divisors function, denoted $\\sigma_1(2025)$. Since $\\sigma_1$ is a multiplicative function, we can compute it using the prime factorization:\n$$\n\\sigma_1(2025) = \\sigma_1(3^4 \\times 5^2) = \\sigma_1(3^4) \\sigma_1(5^2)\n$$\nWe calculate the individual terms:\n$$\n\\sigma_1(3^4) = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} 3^j = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n$$\nAlternatively, using the formula $\\sigma_1(p^e) = \\frac{p^{e+1}-1}{p-1}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_1(3^4) = \\frac{3^5 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\frac{243 - 1}{2} = \\frac{242}{2} = 121\n$$\nAnd for the second term:\n$$\n\\sigma_1(5^2) = \\sum_{j=0}^{2} 5^j = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31\n$$\nUsing the formula:\n$$\n\\sigma_1(5^2) = \\frac{5^3 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\frac{125 - 1}{4} = \\frac{124}{4} = 31\n$$\nNow, we compute the full sum of divisors:\n$$\n\\sigma_1(2025) = 121 \\times 31 = 3751\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the multiplicity $r_4(2025)$:\n$$\nr_4(2025) = 8 \\times \\sigma_1(2025) = 8 \\times 3751 = 30008\n$$\nThus, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda = 2025$ on the $4$-torus $T^4$ is $30008$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{30008}\n$$", "id": "3075361"}]}
