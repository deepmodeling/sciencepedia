All terms like $L^{p}$ spaces, Riemannian manifolds, volume growth, and the Bishop-Gromov theorem are well-established. The volume growth conditions are characteristic of manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. The problem is well-posed, as it asks for a specific value derived from a clear and formalizable definition of \"borderline convergence\" of an integral. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not suffer from any contradictions or missing information. The question is a fundamental calculation in the analysis of partial differential equations on manifolds, not trivial or pseudo-profound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nA function $u$ belongs to the Lebesgue space $L^{p}(M)$ if its $L^{p}$-norm is finite. The $p$-th power of this norm is given by the integral:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{p}(M)}^{p} = \\int_{M} |u(x)|^{p}\\, d\\mu_{g} $$\nThe function $u$ is given to be radial, i.e., $u(x) = \\varphi(r)$ where $r = d(o,x)$. We can express the integral in geodesic polar coordinates around the point $o$. Using the coarea formula, the volume measure $d\\mu_{g}$ can be written as $d\\mu_{g} = A(r) \\, dr$, where $A(r)$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the geodesic sphere $\\partial B(o,r)$ of radius $r$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{p}(M)}^{p} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\varphi(r)|^{p} A(r) \\, dr $$\nThe problem states that the volume growth conditions are compatible with a radial density that \"behaves like $r^{n-1}$\". This is a key simplification, which is exact in the model case of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In this case, $A(r) = C_{n}r^{n-1}$, where $C_{n}$ is the surface area of the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Therefore, the convergence of the integral is determined by the behavior of:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\varphi(r)|^{p} r^{n-1} \\, dr $$\nWe are given that the function has an asymptotic power-type decay, $\\varphi(r) \\approx r^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha  0$, for small and large $r$. Substituting this into the integral, we analyze the convergence of:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |r^{-\\alpha}|^{p} r^{n-1} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (r^{-\\alpha})^{p} r^{n-1} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{-p\\alpha} r^{n-1} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr $$\nTo determine the convergence of this improper integral, we must analyze its behavior at both limits of integration, $r \\to 0$ and $r \\to \\infty$. We split the integral at an arbitrary point, for instance $r=1$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{1} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr + \\int_{1}^{\\infty} r^{n-1-p\\alpha} \\, dr $$\nThis is an integral of the form $\\int r^{k} \\, dr$ with $k = n-1-p\\alpha$.\nFor the integral to converge near $r=0$, the exponent must be greater than $-1$:\n$$ n - 1 - p\\alpha  -1 \\implies n - p\\alpha  0 \\implies n  p\\alpha \\implies \\alpha  \\frac{n}{p} $$\nFor the integral to converge near $r=\\infty$, the exponent must be less than $-1$:\n$$ n - 1 - p\\alpha  -1 \\implies n - p\\alpha  0 \\implies n  p\\alpha \\implies \\alpha  \\frac{n}{p} $$\nThese two conditions, $\\alpha  \\frac{n}{p}$ and $\\alpha  \\frac{n}{p}$, are mutually exclusive. This means that a function with the exact form $u(x) = |x|^{-\\alpha}$ can never be in $L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, as the integral for its norm will always diverge at either the origin or at infinity.\n\nThe problem, however, asks for the critical exponent $\\alpha_{c}$, which is defined as the value of $\\alpha$ for which the \"radial $p$-energy density\" $r^{n-1}|r^{-\\alpha}|^{p}$ has \"borderline convergence\" at both $r \\to 0$ and $r \\to \\infty$. The radial $p$-energy density is the integrand $r^{n-1-p\\alpha}$. The borderline case for convergence of the integral $\\int r^{k} \\, dr$ at both $r=0$ and $r=\\infty$ occurs precisely when the exponent $k$ is equal to $-1$. In this case, the primitive function is $\\ln(r)$, which diverges at both $r \\to 0$ and $r \\to \\infty$. This is the mathematical formalization of \"borderline convergence\" at both ends.\n\nThus, we must set the exponent of $r$ in the integrand to $-1$:\n$$ n - 1 - p\\alpha_{c} = -1 $$\nSolving for the critical exponent $\\alpha_{c}$:\n$$ n - p\\alpha_{c} = 0 $$\n$$ p\\alpha_{c} = n $$\n$$ \\alpha_{c} = \\frac{n}{p} $$\nThis value $\\alpha_{c} = \\frac{n}{p}$ represents the critical decay exponent. For a function to be in $L^p$, it generally needs to be less singular than $r^{-n/p}$ at the origin and decay faster than $r^{-n/p}$ at infinity.

We will first establish the correct form of these three concepts from first principles.\n\nLet $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold, and let $1  p  \\infty$. The space $L^p(M)$ is a Banach space.\n\n(i) **Definition of weak convergence**: A sequence $(u_k)_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in a Banach space $X$ converges weakly to an element $u \\in X$, denoted $u_k \\rightharpoonup u$, if for every continuous linear functional $f$ in the dual space $X^*$, we have $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} f(u_k) = f(u)$.

This means that if a sequence $(u_k)$ converges weakly to $u$, then the norm of the limit is less than or equal to the limit inferior of the norms of the sequence elements.

In uniformly convex spaces like $L^p(M)$ for $1  p  \\infty$, weak convergence $u_k \\rightharpoonup u$ combined with convergence of norms $\\|u_k\\|_{L^p} \\to \\|u\\|_{L^p}$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for strong convergence $\\|u_k - u\\|_{L^p} \\to 0$.\n\n(iii) **Example of weak but not strong convergence**: To find a sequence that converges weakly but not strongly, we need a sequence $(u_k)$ and a limit $u$ such that $u_k \\rightharpoonup u$ but $\\|u_k - u\\|_{L^p(M)}$ does not converge to $0$. A classic way to construct such sequences is by using functions that oscillate with increasing frequency. By the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, such sequences often converge weakly to their average value (frequently $0$), while their energy or $L^p$-norm does not vanish.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option based on these established principles.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A**\n\n*   **Definition of weak convergence**: The option states that $u_k \\rightharpoonup u$ in $L^p(M)$ if and only if for every $v \\in L^{p'}(M)$, $\\int_M (u_k - u)\\, v \\,d\\mu_g \\to 0$. This is the correct definition, as established in point (i).\n*   **Norm property**: The option states that the $L^p$ norm is weakly lower semicontinuous: $\\|u\\|_{L^p(M)} \\le \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} \\|u_k\\|_{L^p(M)}$. This is the correct property, as established in point (ii).\n*   **Example**: The example provided is $u_k(x) = \\sin(2\\pi k x_1)$ on the flat $n$-torus $M=\\mathbb{T}^n$. By the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, for any $v \\in L^{p'}(\\mathbb{T}^n) \\subset L^1(\\mathbb{T}^n)$, the Fourier coefficients must tend to zero. The integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^n} v(x) \\sin(2\\pi k x_1) \\mathrm{d}x$ is related to the $k$-th Fourier coefficient of $v$ with respect to the $x_1$ variable, and it converges to $0$. Thus, $u_k \\rightharpoonup 0$.\n    To check for strong convergence, we compute the norm:\n    $$\n    \\|u_k\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{T}^n)}^p = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^n} |\\sin(2\\pi k x_1)|^p \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_0^1 \\cdots \\int_0^1 |\\sin(2\\pi k x_1)|^p \\,\\mathrm{d}x_1 \\dots \\mathrm{d}x_n = \\int_0^1 |\\sin(2\\pi k x_1)|^p \\,\\mathrm{d}x_1.\n    $$\n    Using the change of variables $y = kx_1$, $\\mathrm{d}y = k\\,\\mathrm{d}x_1$, the integral becomes:\n    $$\n    \\int_0^k |\\sin(2\\pi y)|^p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\int_j^{j+1} |\\sin(2\\pi y)|^p \\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot k \\int_0^1 |\\sin(2\\pi y)|^p \\,\\mathrm{d}y = C_p,\n    $$\n    where $C_p = \\int_0^1 |\\sin(2\\pi y)|^p \\,\\mathrm{d}y$ is a positive constant independent of $k$. Therefore, $\\|u_k\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{T}^n)} = (C_p)^{1/p} \\not\\to 0$. Since the weak limit is $u=0$ and the norm does not converge to $0$, the sequence converges weakly but not strongly. The example is correct.\n\n**Verdict for A**: All three components are stated correctly. This option is **Correct**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B**\n\n*   **Definition of weak convergence**: The option claims that testing against functions in $C_c^\\infty(M)$ is sufficient. Since $M$ is compact, $C_c^\\infty(M) = C^\\infty(M)$. While $C^\\infty(M)$ is dense in $L^{p'}(M)$, testing against a dense subset is only sufficient for weak convergence if the sequence $(u_k)$ is known to be bounded in $L^p(M)$. The definition must hold for all functionals in the dual space $L^{p'}(M)$. As stated with \"if and only if\", this definition is incorrect.\n*   **Norm property**: The option claims the norm is weakly upper semicontinuous, $\\|u\\|_{L^p(M)} \\ge \\limsup_{k\\to\\infty} \\|u_k\\|_{L^p(M)}$. This is the opposite of the correct property. The norm is weakly lower semicontinuous.\n*   **Example**: The example given is $u_k = \\chi_{[0,1/k]\\times \\mathbb{T}^{n-1}}$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$. The $L^p$-norm is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\|u_k\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{T}^n)}^p = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^n} |u_k|^p \\,d\\mu_g = \\mathrm{Volume}([0,1/k]\\times \\mathbb{T}^{n-1}) = \\frac{1}{k}.\n    $$\n    So, $\\|u_k\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{T}^n)} = (1/k)^{1/p}$, which converges to $0$ as $k\\to\\infty$. This means the sequence converges strongly to $0$. Strong convergence implies weak convergence, but the task is to find an example of a sequence that converges weakly but *not* strongly. This example is therefore inappropriate for its stated purpose.\n\n**Verdict for B**: All three components are incorrect. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option C**\n\n*   **Definition of weak convergence**: The option states that weak convergence is equivalent to $\\|u_k - u\\|_{L^p(M)} \\to 0$. This is the definition of **strong convergence**. It is fundamentally different from weak convergence for infinite-dimensional spaces.\n*   **Norm property**: The option claims the norm is weakly continuous, i.e., $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\|u_k\\|_{L^p(M)} = \\|u\\|_{L^p(M)}$. As discussed in point (ii), this is generally false and, combined with weak convergence, implies strong convergence.\n*   **Example**: The sequence is $u_k(x) = f(x + k\\alpha)$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$. The claim is that it \"always converges weakly to the average of $f$\". This is false. Weak convergence to the average $\\bar{f} = \\int f$ occurs if the flow generated by $\\alpha$ is mixing, which requires number-theoretic conditions on the components of $\\alpha$ (e.g., they must be rationally independent). If $\\alpha$ has rational components, the sequence $(u_k)$ can be periodic and may not converge at all. Thus, the word \"always\" makes the statement false.\n\n**Verdict for C**: The first two components are definitions of strong convergence properties, not weak. The example contains a false claim. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option D**\n\n*   **Definition of weak convergence**: The definition proposed is that $F(u_k) \\rightharpoonup F(u)$ for a class of nonlinear functions $F$. This is not the definition of weak convergence. In general, weak convergence is not preserved by nonlinear maps. For example, if $u_k \\rightharpoonup u$, it is not true that $u_k^2 \\rightharpoonup u^2$. Taking $M = [0,1]$, $u_k(x) = \\sin(2\\pi kx)$, we have $u_k \\rightharpoonup 0$. But $u_k^2(x) = \\sin^2(2\\pi kx) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(4\\pi kx))$. Since $\\cos(4\\pi kx) \\rightharpoonup 0$, we have $u_k^2 \\rightharpoonup \\frac{1}{2}$, which is not the square of the weak limit ($0^2=0$). So this proposed definition is incorrect.\n*   **Norm property**: The option claims the norm is weakly continuous, which is incorrect for the same reasons as in Option C.\n*   **Example**: The example is an orthonormal sequence $(e_k)$ of Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions in $L^2(M)$. For any $v \\in L^2(M)$, Bessel's inequality implies $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty |\\langle e_k, v \\rangle_{L^2}|^2 \\le \\|v\\|_{L^2}^2$. For a convergent series, its terms must tend to zero, so $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\langle e_k, v \\rangle_{L^2} = 0$. This is precisely the statement that $e_k \\rightharpoonup 0$ in $L^2(M)$. Since $\\|e_k\\|_{L^2}=1$ for all $k$, the norm does not converge to $\\|0\\|_{L^2}=0$, so the convergence is not strong. The example is correct.\n\n**Verdict for D**: While the example is correct, the definitions of weak convergence and the norm property are incorrect. Therefore, the option as a whole fails. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A correctly states the definition of weak convergence in $L^p(M)$, the property of weak lower semicontinuity of the $L^p$ norm, and provides a valid example of a sequence that converges weakly but not strongly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3078514"}, {"introduction": "After finding a weak solution in a Sobolev space like $H^1(M)$, we naturally ask about its quality: is it merely a square-integrable function with a square-integrable gradient, or does it possess higher regularity?

We are asked to evaluate statements about the embedding of $H^1(M)$ into Lebesgue spaces $L^q(M)$. The key results governing these embeddings are the general Sobolev embedding theorem and its compact version, the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem. For a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$, the embedding $W^{k,p}(M) \\hookrightarrow L^q(M)$ is continuous if $k/p \\ge n/p - n/q$ and compact if $k/p  n/p - n/q$. For our specific case, we have $k=1$, $p=2$, and $n=2$.\n\nThe condition for a continuous embedding is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} \\ge \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{2}{q} \\implies \\frac{1}{2} \\ge 1 - \\frac{2}{q} \\implies \\frac{2}{q} \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\implies q \\le 4 $$\nWait, the general condition is $1/p - k/n \\ge 1/q$. Let's re-evaluate.\nFor $W^{k,p}(M) \\hookrightarrow L^q(M)$ on a compact $n$-manifold:\nThe condition for continuity is $k - \\frac{n}{p} \\ge - \\frac{n}{q}$, which is $\\frac{k}{n} - \\frac{1}{p} \\ge -\\frac{1}{q}$, or $\\frac{1}{p} - \\frac{k}{n} \\le \\frac{1}{q}$.\nFor our case, $k=1$, $p=2$, $n=2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{1}{q} \\implies 0 \\le \\frac{1}{q} $$\nThis inequality holds for any $q \\in [1, \\infty)$. Thus, the embedding $H^1(M) \\hookrightarrow L^q(M)$ is continuous for all $q \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\nThe condition for a compact embedding is the strict inequality:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{q} \\implies 0  \\frac{1}{q} $$\nThis inequality holds for any $q \\in [1, \\infty)$, but not for $q=\\infty$.\n\nThe case $q=\\infty$ is the critical case, where $\\frac{1}{p} - \\frac{k}{n} = \\frac{1}{q}$ (i.e., $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$). In this critical situation where $kp=n$, the embedding into $L^\\infty$ generally fails. For $k=1, p=2, n=2$, we have $kp=1 \\cdot 2 = 2 = n$, so this is indeed the critical case.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThe statement is: \"For every $q\\in[1,\\infty)$, the embedding $H^1(M)\\hookrightarrow L^q(M)$ is continuous and compact.\"\nBased on the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem for compact manifolds, the condition for a compact embedding is $0  1/q$. This is satisfied for all finite $q$, i.e., for all $q \\in [1, \\infty)$. Since compactness of an embedding implies its continuity, the statement is correct.\nThe verdict is **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe statement is: \"There exists a constant $C0$, depending only on $(M,g)$, such that $\\|u\\|_{L^\\infty(M)}\\le C\\,\\|u\\|_{H^1(M)}$ for all $u\\in H^1(M)$.\"\nThis inequality is the definition of a continuous embedding of $H^1(M)$ into $L^\\infty(M)$. As established above, we are in the critical case $n=kp=2$, for which the Sobolev embedding into $L^\\infty(M)$ fails. Therefore, no such constant $C$ exists. This is a fundamental result in the theory of Sobolev spaces.\nThe verdict is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe statement is: \"There exists a sequence $(u_k)_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\subset C^\\infty(M)$ with $\\|u_k\\|_{H^1(M)}\\le 1$ for all $k$ and $\\|u_k\\|_{L^\\infty(M)}\\to\\infty$ as $k\\to\\infty$.\"\nThis statement is the formal negation of the embedding property stated in B. If the embedding were continuous (as in B), any sequence $(u_k)$ that is bounded in the $H^1(M)$ norm would also have to be bounded in the $L^\\infty(M)$ norm. Since the embedding is not continuous, its operator norm is infinite. This implies the existence of a sequence of functions (which can be chosen to be smooth, as $C^\\infty(M)$ is dense in $H^1(M)$) that is bounded in the $H^1(M)$ norm but unbounded in the $L^\\infty(M)$ norm. A standard example of such a sequence can be constructed locally using logarithmic functions that concentrate at a point. For instance, in a coordinate chart, functions like $u_k(x) = (\\log k)^{-1/2} \\log(\\log(k^2/|x|^2))$ suitably cut off demonstrate this behavior. Thus, this statement correctly describes the failure of the critical Sobolev embedding.\nThe verdict is **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThe statement is: \"There exist constants $\\alpha0$ and $C0$, depending only on $(M,g)$, such that for every $u\\in H^1(M)$ with $\\int_M u\\,d\\mu_g=0$ and $\\|\\nabla_g u\\|_{L^2(M)}\\le 1$, one has the Moser–Trudinger-type estimate $\\int_M \\exp\\!\\left(\\alpha\\,u^2\\right)\\,d\\mu_g\\le C$.\"\nThis statement describes the Moser-Trudinger inequality, which is the sharp replacement for the failed critical Sobolev embedding into $L^\\infty$. The general form of the inequality for a closed $n$-dimensional manifold states that if a function $u \\in W^{1,n}(M)$ has its $W^{1,n}(M)$ norm controlled, then $\\exp(\\beta |u|^{n/(n-1)})$ is integrable for a sufficiently small constant $\\beta0$.\nIn our case, $n=2$ and the space is $H^1(M)=W^{1,2}(M)$. The exponent in the exponential term is $u^{2/(2-1)} = u^2$, which matches the statement. The conditions provided are $\\|\\nabla_g u\\|_{L^2(M)} \\le 1$ and $\\int_M u\\,d\\mu_g=0$. On a compact manifold $(M,g)$, the Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality guarantees the existence of a constant $C_P$ such that for any function $u \\in H^1(M)$ with zero mean, $\\|u\\|_{L^2(M)} \\le C_P \\|\\nabla_g u\\|_{L^2(M)}$.\nTherefore, the conditions $\\|\\nabla_g u\\|_{L^2(M)} \\le 1$ and $\\int_M u \\, d\\mu_g=0$ together imply that the full $H^1(M)$ norm is bounded:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{H^1(M)}^2 = \\|u\\|_{L^2(M)}^2 + \\|\\nabla_g u\\|_{L^2(M)}^2 \\le (C_P^2 \\|\\nabla_g u\\|_{L^2(M)})^2 + \\|\\nabla_g u\\|_{L^2(M)}^2 \\le C_P^2 + 1 $$\nSince the $H^1(M)$ norm is bounded, the Moser-Trudinger inequality applies and guarantees the existence of constants $\\alpha0$ and $C0$ such that the integral $\\int_M \\exp(\\alpha u^2) \\, d\\mu_g$ is bounded.\nThe verdict is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3078524"}]}
