The solution will now be developed.\n\n### Eigenvalue and Eigenfunction Determination\n\nThe eigenvalue problem is given by the ordinary differential equation $u''(x) + \\lambda u(x) = 0$, with boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$. The characteristic equation for this ODE is $r^{2} + \\lambda = 0$, which yields $r = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\lambda}$. We analyze the nature of the solutions based on the sign of $\\lambda$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\lambda < 0$**\nLet $\\lambda = -\\mu^{2}$ for some real $\\mu > 0$. The ODE becomes $u''(x) - \\mu^{2} u(x) = 0$. The general solution can be written as $u(x) = A\\cosh(\\mu x) + B\\sinh(\\mu x)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$u(0) = A\\cosh(0) + B\\sinh(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A = 0$.\nThe solution reduces to $u(x) = B\\sinh(\\mu x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $u(L)=0$:\n$u(L) = B\\sinh(\\mu L) = 0$.\nSince $L > 0$ and $\\mu > 0$, we have $\\sinh(\\mu L) \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $B=0$.\nThis leads to the trivial solution $u(x) = 0$. Since eigenfunctions must be nontrivial, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\n**Case 2: $\\lambda = 0$**\nThe ODE becomes $u''(x) = 0$. The general solution is $u(x) = Ax + B$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$u(0) = A(0) + B = B = 0$.\nThe solution reduces to $u(x) = Ax$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $u(L)=0$:\n$u(L) = AL = 0$.\nSince $L > 0$, we must have $A=0$.\nThis also leads to the trivial solution $u(x) = 0$. Thus, $\\lambda=0$ is not an eigenvalue.\n\n**Case 3: $\\lambda > 0$**\nLet $\\lambda = k^{2}$ for some real $k > 0$. The ODE becomes $u''(x) + k^{2} u(x) = 0$. The general solution is $u(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$u(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A = 0$.\nThe solution reduces to $u(x) = B\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $u(L)=0$:\n$u(L) = B\\sin(kL) = 0$.\nFor a nontrivial solution, we require $B \\neq 0$. This implies that $\\sin(kL) = 0$.\nThe sine function is zero at integer multiples of $\\pi$. Thus, $kL = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSince we defined $k > 0$ and $L > 0$, $n$ must be a positive integer, i.e., $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThis quantizes the possible values of $k$:\n$k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe corresponding eigenvalues are:\n$\\lambda_n = k_n^{2} = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}$.\nThe unnormalized eigenfunctions associated with each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$ are of the form $u_n(x) = B_n \\sin(k_n x) = B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$, where $B_n$ is an arbitrary non-zero constant.\n\n### Normalization of Eigenfunctions\n\nWe need to find the normalization constant $C_n$ such that the function $\\phi_n(x) = C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ has a norm of $1$ in $L^{2}(0,L)$. The condition is $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_n \\rangle = 1$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\left(C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right)^{2} dx = 1\n$$\n$$\nC_n^{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = 1\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(L - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi} \\sin(2n\\pi)\\right) - \\left(0 - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi} \\sin(0)\\right) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sin(2n\\pi) = 0$ for any integer $n$, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2}(L - 0) = \\frac{L}{2}$.\nSubstituting this back into the normalization condition:\n$C_n^{2} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = 1 \\implies C_n^{2} = \\frac{2}{L}$.\nBy convention, we choose the positive root for the normalization constant, so $C_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$.\nThe normalized eigenfunctions are:\n$\\phi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n### Verification of Orthonormality\n\nWe must verify that $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\delta_{nm}$, where $\\delta_{nm}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nThe case $n=m$ has already been established during normalization, as $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_n \\rangle = 1$.\nNow we consider the case $n \\neq m$, where $n$ and $m$ are distinct positive integers.\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx\n$$\nWe use the product-to-sum identity $\\sin(A)\\sin(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B) - \\cos(A+B)]$.\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{(n-m)\\pi x}{L}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{(n+m)\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right] dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\frac{L}{(n-m)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n-m)\\pi x}{L}\\right) - \\frac{L}{(n+m)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n+m)\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L}\n$$\nSince $n \\neq m$, the denominators $n-m$ and $n+m$ are non-zero.\nEvaluating at the limits:\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n-m} \\sin((n-m)\\pi) - \\frac{1}{n+m} \\sin((n+m)\\pi) \\right] - \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n-m} \\sin(0) - \\frac{1}{n+m} \\sin(0) \\right]\n$$\nSince $n$ and $m$ are integers, $n-m$ and $n+m$ are also integers. The sine of any integer multiple of $\\pi$ is $0$.\nTherefore, $\\sin((n-m)\\pi)=0$ and $\\sin((n+m)\\pi)=0$. The expression evaluates to $0$.\nThis confirms that $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = 0$ for $n \\neq m$.\nThe family of functions $\\{\\phi_n(x)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is thus orthonormal on $L^{2}(0,L)$.\n\nThe $n$th eigenvalue is $\\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}$ and the corresponding $L^{2}(0,L)$-normalized eigenfunction is $\\phi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$, for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} & \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3063295"}, {"introduction": "Moving from one to two dimensions, we now consider the spectrum of a rectangular domain.

Do not round.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a standard, well-posed problem in partial differential equations and spectral geometry. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and self-contained.\n\nWe are asked to solve the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for the Laplace operator on a rectangular domain $\\Omega=[0,a]\\times[0,b]$, where $a>0$ and $b>0$. The governing partial differential equation (PDE) is\n$$\n\\Delta u + \\lambda u = 0, \\quad (x,y) \\in \\Omega\n$$\nwith the boundary condition $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. Here $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is the Laplace operator.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables. We assume a non-trivial solution of the form $u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the PDE, we get\n$$\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) + \\lambda X(x)Y(y) = 0\n$$\nwhere $X''(x) = \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$ and $Y''(y) = \\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2}$.

This separates the PDE into two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\nX''(x) + \\mu X(x) = 0\n$$\n$$\nY''(y) + \\nu Y(y) = 0\n$$\nThe boundary condition $u|_{\\partial\\Omega}=0$ implies:\n$u(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = 0 \\implies X(0) = 0$\n$u(a,y) = X(a)Y(y) = 0 \\implies X(a) = 0$\n$u(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = 0 \\implies Y(0) = 0$\n$u(x,b) = X(x)Y(b) = 0 \\implies Y(b) = 0$\n(assuming $Y(y)$ and $X(x)$ are not identically zero).\n\nWe first solve the boundary value problem for $X(x)$:\n$X''(x) + \\mu X(x) = 0$ with $X(0) = 0$ and $X(a) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we must have $\\mu > 0$. The general solution is $X(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{\\mu}x) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}x)$.\nThe condition $X(0)=0$ implies $C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = 0$.\nThe solution is now $X(x) = C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}x)$.\nThe condition $X(a)=0$ implies $C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}a) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C_2 \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}a) = 0$.\nThis requires $\\sqrt{\\mu}a = m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.

The multiplicity of an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is the number of distinct pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ that yield the same value $\\lambda_{m,n}$. A repeated eigenvalue occurs if there exist two distinct pairs $(m_1, n_1)$ and $(m_2, n_2)$ such that $\\lambda_{m_1,n_1} = \\lambda_{m_2,n_2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{m_1^2}{a^2} + \\frac{n_1^2}{b^2} = \\frac{m_2^2}{a^2} + \\frac{n_2^2}{b^2}\n$$\nLet $\\rho = a/b$ be the aspect ratio.

Since $m_1, m_2, n_1, n_2$ are integers, the right-hand side is a rational number. An irrational number can equal a rational number only if both are zero. This implies $m_2^2 - m_1^2 = 0$ and $n_1^2 - n_2^2 = 0$. Since $m,n$ are positive, this means $m_1=m_2$ and $n_1=n_2$. Therefore, if $\\rho^2$ is irrational, every eigenvalue is simple (has multiplicity $1$).\n\nMultiplicities greater than $1$ can occur if $\\rho^2$ is rational. This is a number theoretic condition. The most prominent special case is the square, where $a=b$. In this case, $\\rho=1$ and $\\rho^2=1$. The condition for repeated eigenvalues becomes $m_1^2 + n_1^2 = m_2^2 + n_2^2$.\nFor any pair of distinct positive integers $(m,n)$, the pairs $(m,n)$ and $(n,m)$ are distinct. However, they give the same sum $m^2+n^2=n^2+m^2$. For instance, $\\lambda_{m,n} = \\lambda_{n,m}$. This implies that for a square domain, any eigenvalue $\\lambda_{m,n}$ with $m \\neq n$ has a multiplicity of at least $2$. The eigenfunctions $u_{m,n}$ and $u_{n,m}$ are linearly independent.\n\nFinally, we specialize to the square case $a=b=L$ with $L>0$ and find the smallest eigenvalue with multiplicity strictly greater than $1$. The eigenvalues are given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_{m,n} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}(m^2+n^2), \\quad m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest integer value of $k = m^2+n^2$ that can be represented as a sum of two squares of positive integers in more than one way. Let's list the values of $k$ for small $m,n$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $m=1, n=1$: $k = 1^2+1^2 = 2$. The only pair of positive integers is $(1,1)$. So the eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1,1} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{L^2}$ has multiplicity $1$. This is the smallest eigenvalue (the ground state).\n    \\item $m=1, n=2$: $k = 1^2+2^2 = 5$. The pair is $(1,2)$.\n    \\item $m=2, n=1$: $k = 2^2+1^2 = 5$. The pair is $(2,1)$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe integer $k=5$ is generated by two distinct pairs of positive integers: $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$.

The possible sums in increasing order are:\n$1^2+1^2 = 2$ (multiplicity $1$)\n$1^2+2^2 = 5$ (multiplicity $2$, from $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$)\n$2^2+2^2 = 8$ (multiplicity $1$)\n$1^2+3^2 = 10$ (multiplicity $2$, from $(1,3)$ and $(3,1)$)\n...\nThe smallest value of $m^2+n^2$ that is not unique corresponds to $k=5$. Thus, the smallest eigenvalue with multiplicity strictly greater than one is the one associated with $k=5$.\n\nThis eigenvalue is $\\frac{5\\pi^2}{L^2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}}}$$", "id": "3063323"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem explores the spectrum of a flat torus, $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$, a fundamental example of a compact manifold without a boundary.

In other words, the eigenvalues are in bijection with squared norms of integer lattice vectors, up to the common scaling factor of $4\\pi^{2}$, and the multiplicity equals the count of integer representations of the associated squared norm.\n\nWe now compute the multiplicity of the specific eigenvalue $\\lambda = 20\\pi^{2}$. The eigenvalue condition is\n$4\\pi^{2}(m^{2}+n^{2}) = 20\\pi^{2} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad m^{2}+n^{2} = 5$.\nTherefore, we must count the number of integer pairs $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ satisfying $m^{2}+n^{2} = 5$. We list all integer solutions. The nonnegative squares that sum to $5$ are $(m^{2}, n^{2}) \\in \\{(1,4), (4,1)\\}$, since $(0,5)$ and $(5,0)$ are not possible with integers $m$ and $n$. For $(m^{2}, n^{2}) = (1,4)$, we have $(m,n) \\in \\{(1,2), (1,-2), (-1,2), (-1,-2)\\}$, and for $(m^{2}, n^{2}) = (4,1)$, we have $(m,n) \\in \\{(2,1), (2,-1), (-2,1), (-2,-1)\\}$. Thus there are $8$ distinct integer lattice vectors with squared norm equal to $5$, and hence there are $8$ distinct Fourier modes $u_{m,n}$ with eigenvalue $20\\pi^{2}$.\n\nConsequently, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda = 20\\pi^{2}$ equals $8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "3063318"}]}
