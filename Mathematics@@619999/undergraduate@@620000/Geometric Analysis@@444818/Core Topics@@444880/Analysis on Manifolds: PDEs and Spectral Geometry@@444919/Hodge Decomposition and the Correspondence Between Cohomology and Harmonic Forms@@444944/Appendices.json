The operator $\\ast$ maps a $k$-form to an $(n-k)$-form, where $n=2$ is the dimension of the manifold.\n\nFirst, we must establish the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ on the spaces of forms $\\Omega^k(U)$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. This inner product is induced by the Riemannian metric $g$.\n\nThe metric $g = dx^{2} + dy^{2}$ implies that the matrix of the metric tensor in the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y\\}$ is the identity matrix. Consequently, the dual basis of $1$-forms, $\\{dx, dy\\}$, is orthonormal. The inner products of these basis $1$-forms are:\n$$\n\\langle dx, dx \\rangle = 1, \\quad \\langle dy, dy \\rangle = 1, \\quad \\langle dx, dy \\rangle = 0\n$$\n\nFor $0$-forms, which are smooth functions $f, h \\in C^\\infty(U) = \\Omega^0(U)$, the inner product is their pointwise product:\n$$\n\\langle f, h \\rangle = fh\n$$\nIn particular, for the basis $0$-form $1$, we have $\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nFor $2$-forms, the basis is $\\{dx \\wedge dy\\}$. The inner product is defined such that if the basis of $1$-forms is orthonormal, the corresponding basis of $k$-forms formed by their wedge products is also orthonormal. Since $\\{dx, dy\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\Omega^1(U)$, the set $\\{dx \\wedge dy\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\Omega^2(U)$.

Let $\\ast dx = a \\cdot dx + b \\cdot dy$ for some functions $a, b \\in C^\\infty(U)$.

Let $\\ast dy = c \\cdot dx + d \\cdot dy$ for functions $c, d \\in C^\\infty(U)$.\n\nUsing $\\alpha = dx$ and $\\beta = dy$:\n$$\ndx \\wedge \\ast dy = \\langle dx, dy \\rangle \\, dV_g\n$$\n$dx \\wedge (c \\cdot dx + d \\cdot dy) = 0 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy)$\n$c(dx \\wedge dx) + d(dx \\wedge dy) = 0$\n$0 + d(dx \\wedge dy) = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n\nUsing $\\alpha = dy$ and $\\beta = dy$:\n$$\ndy \\wedge \\ast dy = \\langle dy, dy \\rangle \\, dV_g\n$$\n$dy \\wedge (c \\cdot dx + d \\cdot dy) = 1 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy)$\n$c(dy \\wedge dx) + d(dy \\wedge dy) = dx \\wedge dy$\n$c(-dx \\wedge dy) + 0 = dx \\wedge dy \\implies -c = 1 \\implies c = -1$.\nThus, $c=-1$ and $d=0$, which gives\n$$\n\\ast dy = -dx\n$$\n\n**4. Verification of $\\ast \\ast = -\\mathrm{Id}$ on 1-forms**\n\nAs required, we verify from first principles that applying the Hodge star twice to a $1$-form is equivalent to multiplication by $-1$. We test this on the basis $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$.\nApplying $\\ast$ to $\\ast dx$:\n$$\n\\ast(\\ast dx) = \\ast(dy) = -dx\n$$\nApplying $\\ast$ to $\\ast dy$:\n$$\n\\ast(\\ast dy) = \\ast(-dx) = -\\ast(dx) = -dy\n$$\nSince $\\ast$ is a linear operator, for any $1$-form $\\omega = f dx + h dy$ where $f, h$ are functions:\n$$\n\\ast(\\ast \\omega) = \\ast(\\ast(f dx + h dy)) = \\ast(f (\\ast dx) + h (\\ast dy)) = f (\\ast(\\ast dx)) + h (\\ast(\\ast dy)) = f(-dx) + h(-dy) = -(f dx + h dy) = -\\omega\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\ast\\ast = -\\mathrm{Id}$ on the space of $1$-forms, $\\Omega^1(U)$. This is consistent with the general formula $\\ast\\ast_k = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\\mathrm{Id}_k$ for $k=1$ and $n=2$, which gives $(-1)^{1(2-1)}=-1$.\n\nThe final results for the action of $\\ast$ on the basis forms are:\n$\\ast 1 = dx \\wedge dy$\n$\\ast dx = dy$\n$\\ast dy = -dx$\n$\\ast(dx \\wedge dy) = 1$\n\nThese results are to be provided as a $1 \\times 4$ row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} dx \\wedge dy & dy & -dx & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3052533"}, {"introduction": "The power of Hodge theory lies in its profound connection between the analysis of differential forms and the topology of the underlying manifold.

We shall proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address them in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Show that the $1$-form $\\omega$ is closed but not exact on $S^1$.\n\nLet the given $1$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ be $\\alpha = \\frac{-y\\,dx + x\\,dy}{x^{2} + y^{2}}$. A form is closed if its exterior derivative is zero. We compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d\\left(\\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}dx\\right) + d\\left(\\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}dy\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $d(f\\,dg) = df \\wedge dg$, we have:\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) dy \\wedge dx + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(x^{2}+y^{2}) - x(2x)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(-1)(x^{2}+y^{2}) - (-y)(2y)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{-x^{2}-y^{2}+2y^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\alpha$ and using $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\left(-\\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} + \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}\\right) dx \\wedge dy = 0\n$$\nSince $d\\alpha = 0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the $1$-form $\\alpha$ is closed. The form $\\omega$ on $S^{1}$ is defined as the pullback of $\\alpha$ by the inclusion map $\\iota: S^{1} \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, i.e., $\\omega = \\iota^{*}\\alpha$. The exterior derivative commutes with pullbacks, so we have:\n$$\nd\\omega = d(\\iota^{*}\\alpha) = \\iota^{*}(d\\alpha) = \\iota^{*}(0) = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\omega$ is a closed $1$-form on $S^{1}$.\n\nNext, we must show that $\\omega$ is not exact. A $1$-form is exact if it is the differential of a $0$-form (a smooth function). Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\omega$ is exact on $S^{1}$. Then there exists a smooth function $f: S^{1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\omega = df$.\nAccording to Stokes' theorem, the integral of an exact form over a closed manifold (a manifold without boundary) is zero. The circle $S^{1}$ is a compact $1$-dimensional manifold with no boundary, i.e., $\\partial S^{1} = \\emptyset$. Therefore, if $\\omega = df$, we would have:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{1}} \\omega = \\int_{S^{1}} df = \\int_{\\partial S^{1}} f = \\int_{\\emptyset} f = 0\n$$\nTo check if this is the case, we compute the integral of $\\omega$ over $S^{1}$. We use the standard counterclockwise parametrization of $S^{1}$, given by $\\gamma: [0, 2\\pi] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $\\gamma(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$. On the image of this map, which is $S^{1}$, we have $x = \\cos\\theta$ and $y = \\sin\\theta$. Consequently, $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$. The differentials are $dx = -\\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta$ and $dy = \\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta$.\nThe pullback of $\\omega$ to the parameter domain $[0, 2\\pi]$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma^{*}\\omega = \\gamma^{*}(\\iota^{*}\\alpha) = (\\iota \\circ \\gamma)^{*}\\alpha\n$$\nHowever, $\\iota \\circ \\gamma$ is just the parametrization map of $S^1$. We substitute the parametrized expressions into $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\gamma^{*}\\omega = \\frac{-(\\sin\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta) + (\\cos\\theta)(\\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta)}{(\\cos\\theta)^{2}+(\\sin\\theta)^{2}} = \\frac{\\sin^{2}\\theta + \\cos^{2}\\theta}{1}d\\theta = d\\theta\n$$\nNow we can compute the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{1}} \\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma^{*}\\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi\n$$\nSince $\\int_{S^{1}} \\omega = 2\\pi \\neq 0$, our assumption that $\\omega$ is exact leads to a contradiction. Therefore, $\\omega$ is not an exact form on $S^{1}$. This completes the first part.\n\nPart 2: Characterize the harmonic $1$-forms on $S^{1}$.\n\nA $k$-form $\\eta$ on a compact oriented Riemannian manifold is harmonic if it is in the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian operator $\\Delta = d\\delta + \\delta d$. This condition, $\\Delta\\eta = 0$, is equivalent to the simultaneous conditions $d\\eta=0$ and $\\delta\\eta=0$.\n\nLet $\\eta$ be an arbitrary smooth $1$-form on $S^{1}$. Since $S^{1}$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold, the space of $2$-forms $\\Omega^{2}(S^{1})$ is trivial (i.e., it contains only the zero form). The exterior derivative $d$ maps $1$-forms to $2$-forms, so $d: \\Omega^{1}(S^{1}) \\to \\Omega^{2}(S^{1}) = \\{0\\}$. Therefore, $d\\eta=0$ for any $1$-form $\\eta$ on $S^{1}$. The condition for a $1$-form to be harmonic on $S^{1}$ thus simplifies to just $\\delta\\eta=0$.\n\nThe codifferential $\\delta$ is defined as $\\delta = -\\star d \\star$, where $\\star$ is the Hodge star operator. Let us work in the standard angular coordinate $\\theta$ on $S^{1}$. The Riemannian metric induced from $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is $ds^{2} = d\\theta^{2}$. The oriented unit-speed coframe is the set $\\{d\\theta\\}$, which is also the volume form on $S^{1}$. The Hodge star operator maps $p$-forms to $(n-p)$-forms, where here the dimension is $n=1$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For a $0$-form (function) $h$, $\\star h = h\\, d\\theta$.\n    \\item For a $1$-form $g\\,d\\theta$, $\\star(g\\,d\\theta) = g$.\n\\end{itemize}\nAny $1$-form $\\eta$ on $S^{1}$ can be written globally as $\\eta = f(\\theta)d\\theta$ for some smooth $2\\pi$-periodic function $f$. We now compute $\\delta\\eta$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $\\star\\eta = \\star(f(\\theta)d\\theta) = f(\\theta)$. This is a $0$-form.\n    \\item $d(\\star\\eta) = d(f(\\theta)) = \\frac{df}{d\\theta} d\\theta$. This is a $1$-form.\n    \\item $\\star(d(\\star\\eta)) = \\star\\left(\\frac{df}{d\\theta} d\\theta\\right) = \\frac{df}{d\\theta}$. This is a $0$-form.\n    \\item $\\delta\\eta = -\\star d \\star \\eta = -\\frac{df}{d\\theta}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe condition $\\delta\\eta=0$ implies $-\\frac{df}{d\\theta}=0$, which means $f(\\theta)$ must be a constant, say $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nTherefore, a $1$-form on $S^{1}$ is harmonic if and only if it is of the form $\\eta = c\\,d\\theta$ for some constant $c$. This proves that any harmonic $1$-form on $S^{1}$ has a constant coefficient in the oriented unit-speed coframe $\\{d\\theta\\}$.\n\nTo show that such a form is parallel, we must show that its covariant derivative $\\nabla\\eta$ is zero. Let $E_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$ be the unit tangent vector field corresponding to the coordinate $\\theta$. The metric components $g_{\\theta\\theta}=1$ are constant, so the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection are all zero. This implies that $\\nabla_{E_1}E_1=0$. The covariant derivative of a $1$-form $\\eta$ is given by the formula $(\\nabla_X \\eta)(Y) = X(\\eta(Y)) - \\eta(\\nabla_X Y)$. For $\\eta = c\\,d\\theta$ with constant $c$, and $X=Y=E_1$, we have:\n$$\n\\eta(E_1) = (c\\,d\\theta)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\right) = c\n$$\nThis is a constant function on $S^{1}$. Then $E_1(\\eta(E_1)) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}(c)=0$.\nThe covariant derivative is then:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{E_1}\\eta)(E_1) = E_1(\\eta(E_1)) - \\eta(\\nabla_{E_1}E_1) = 0 - \\eta(0) = 0\n$$\nSince any vector field on $S^{1}$ is a scalar multiple of $E_1$, it follows that $\\nabla\\eta=0$. Thus, any harmonic $1$-form on $S^{1}$ is a parallel form.\n\nPart 3: Determine the constant $c$ for the harmonic representative of $[\\omega]$.\n\nThe Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a compact, oriented Riemannian manifold, each de Rham cohomology class contains a unique harmonic representative. Let $\\omega_h$ be the unique harmonic representative in the class $[\\omega] \\in H^{1}(S^1; \\mathbb{R})$.\nFrom Part 2, we know that any harmonic $1$-form on $S^{1}$ must be of the form $c\\,d\\theta$ for some constant coefficient $c$. The form $d\\theta$ is the basis element for the oriented unit-speed coframe. So, $\\omega_h = c\\,d\\theta$.\n\nThe fact that $\\omega$ and $\\omega_h$ belong to the same cohomology class, $[\\omega]=[\\omega_h]$, means that their difference is an exact form: $\\omega - \\omega_h = dg$ for some smooth function $g:S^1\\to\\mathbb{R}$. A consequence of this is that their integrals over any closed cycle must be equal. For the cycle $S^{1}$ itself:\n$$\n\\int_{S^1} \\omega = \\int_{S^1} \\omega_h\n$$\nThis is because $\\int_{S^1} (\\omega - \\omega_h) = \\int_{S^1} dg = \\int_{\\partial S^1} g = 0$.\n\nWe have already computed the integral of $\\omega$ in Part 1:\n$$\n\\int_{S^1} \\omega = 2\\pi\n$$\nNow, we compute the integral of the harmonic representative $\\omega_h = c\\,d\\theta$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^1} \\omega_h = \\int_0^{2\\pi} c\\,d\\theta = c \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = c(2\\pi)\n$$\nEquating the two integrals gives the value of $c$:\n$$\n2\\pi c = 2\\pi \\implies c = 1\n$$\nThus, the unique harmonic representative of $[\\omega]$ is $\\omega_h = 1 \\cdot d\\theta$, and the constant coefficient is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3052519"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the mechanics of the Hodge star ([@problem_id:3052533]) and the concept of a harmonic representative ([@problem_id:3052519]), we can now apply this machinery to understand the topology of more complex spaces.

This can be verified from the definition $\\delta = (-1)^{n k + n + 1} \\star d \\star$ using the factorization of the Hodge star and the fact that $d$ commutes with pullback.\nCombining these gives a splitting property for the Hodge Laplacian on pullbacks:\n$$\n\\Delta_M (\\pi_1^{\\ast} \\alpha) = \\pi_1^{\\ast} (\\Delta_{S^1} \\alpha), \\quad\n\\Delta_M (\\pi_2^{\\ast} \\beta) = \\pi_2^{\\ast} (\\Delta_{\\Sigma_g} \\beta).\n$$\n\nWe now address the requested items.\n\nFor item $1$, let $\\alpha$ be a harmonic $1$-form on $S^1$, so $\\Delta_{S^1} \\alpha = 0$. By the splitting property, we have\n$$\n\\Delta_M (\\pi_1^{\\ast} \\alpha) = \\pi_1^{\\ast} (\\Delta_{S^1} \\alpha) = \\pi_1^{\\ast} (0) = 0,\n$$\nso $\\pi_1^{\\ast} \\alpha$ is harmonic on $M$. Similarly, if $\\beta$ is a harmonic $1$-form on $\\Sigma_g$, then $\\Delta_{\\Sigma_g} \\beta = 0$, and therefore\n$$\n\\Delta_M (\\pi_2^{\\ast} \\beta) = \\pi_2^{\\ast} (\\Delta_{\\Sigma_g} \\beta) = 0,\n$$\nso $\\pi_2^{\\ast} \\beta$ is harmonic on $M$. This constructs nontrivial harmonic $1$-forms on $M$ arising from the factors.\n\nFor item $2$, we use the canonical identification of $1$-forms on $M$:\n$$\n\\Omega^1(M) \\cong \\pi_1^{\\ast} \\Omega^1(S^1) \\oplus \\pi_2^{\\ast} \\Omega^1(\\Sigma_g).\n$$\nIndeed, any $1$-form on $M$ can be written as a sum of a component pulled back from $S^1$ and a component pulled back from $\\Sigma_g$, due to the product structure and the fact that at each point, the cotangent space decomposes as a direct sum of the pullbacks of the cotangent spaces from the factors. Consider a $1$-form $\\omega \\in \\Omega^1(M)$ written as $\\omega = \\pi_1^{\\ast} \\alpha \\oplus \\pi_2^{\\ast} \\beta$. The Hodge Laplacian respects this orthogonal splitting under the product metric:\n$$\n\\Delta_M \\omega = \\Delta_M (\\pi_1^{\\ast} \\alpha) \\oplus \\Delta_M (\\pi_2^{\\ast} \\beta)\n= \\pi_1^{\\ast} (\\Delta_{S^1} \\alpha) \\oplus \\pi_2^{\\ast} (\\Delta_{\\Sigma_g} \\beta).\n$$\nTherefore, $\\Delta_M \\omega = 0$ if and only if $\\Delta_{S^1} \\alpha = 0$ and $\\Delta_{\\Sigma_g} \\beta = 0$. It follows that a $1$-form on $M$ is harmonic if and only if each of its components pulled back from the factors is harmonic. Consequently, the space of harmonic $1$-forms on $M$ splits as the direct sum\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^1(M) \\cong \\pi_1^{\\ast} \\mathcal{H}^1(S^1) \\oplus \\pi_2^{\\ast} \\mathcal{H}^1(\\Sigma_g),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}^1(\\cdot)$ denotes the space of harmonic $1$-forms. In particular, if $\\{\\eta_1,\\dots,\\eta_{2g}\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{H}^1(\\Sigma_g)$ and $\\theta$ denotes a nonzero harmonic $1$-form on $S^1$ (for instance, with a standard metric, the form $d\\vartheta$ in the angular coordinate is harmonic), then $\\{\\pi_1^{\\ast} \\theta, \\pi_2^{\\ast} \\eta_1, \\dots, \\pi_2^{\\ast} \\eta_{2g}\\}$ is a basis of $\\mathcal{H}^1(M)$.\n\nFor item $3$, the Hodge theorem implies $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{H}^1(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(X)$ for any closed Riemannian manifold $X$. For $S^1$, we have $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{H}^1(S^1) = 1$. For $\\Sigma_g$, classical results yield $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{H}^1(\\Sigma_g) = 2g$. Using the direct sum decomposition from item $2$, we obtain\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{H}^1(M) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{H}^1(S^1) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{H}^1(\\Sigma_g) = 1 + 2g.\n$$\nTherefore, the real dimension of the space of harmonic $1$-forms on $M = S^1 \\times \\Sigma_g$ is $1 + 2g$.\n\nThe requested final expression in terms of $g$ is thus $1 + 2g$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2g+1}$$", "id": "3052511"}]}
