It is a well-posed and scientifically grounded question that asks for a derivation of the mean value properties for harmonic functions, a fundamental result in the theory of partial differential equations. The provided information is complete and consistent. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $u \\in C^{2}(\\Omega)$ be a harmonic function, meaning $\\Delta u = 0$ for all points in the open set $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $n \\geq 2$. Let $x_0 \\in \\Omega$ and $r > 0$ be a radius such that the closed ball $\\overline{B_r(x_0)}$ is contained in $\\Omega$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the spherical average, $A_S(r)$.\nThe spherical average is defined as\n$$\nA_S(r) := \\frac{1}{|S_r(x_0)|} \\int_{S_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, d\\sigma(x)\n$$\nwhere $|S_r(x_0)| = \\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1}$ is the surface area of the $(n-1)$-dimensional sphere of radius $r$, and $\\omega_{n-1}$ is the area of the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nTo analyze the dependence of $A_S(r)$ on $r$, we shall compute its derivative, $\\frac{d}{dr}A_S(r)$. It is convenient to perform a change of variables to the unit sphere $S_1(0)$. Any point $x \\in S_r(x_0)$ can be written as $x = x_0 + r\\xi$ for a unique $\\xi \\in S_1(0)$. The surface element transforms as $d\\sigma(x) = r^{n-1} d\\sigma(\\xi)$. Substituting this into the definition of $A_S(r)$:\n$$\nA_S(r) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1}} \\int_{S_1(0)} u(x_0 + r\\xi) \\, r^{n-1} d\\sigma(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1}} \\int_{S_1(0)} u(x_0 + r\\xi) \\, d\\sigma(\\xi)\n$$\nSince $u \\in C^2(\\Omega)$ and the integration domain is fixed, we can differentiate under the integral sign with respect to $r$ using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} A_S(r) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1}} \\int_{S_1(0)} \\nabla u(x_0 + r\\xi) \\cdot \\xi \\, d\\sigma(\\xi)\n$$\nLet us transform the integral back to the sphere $S_r(x_0)$. For $x = x_0 + r\\xi$, the outward unit normal vector to $S_r(x_0)$ at $x$ is $\\nu(x) = \\frac{x-x_0}{r} = \\xi$. The surface element is $d\\sigma(\\xi) = r^{-(n-1)} d\\sigma(x)$. Substituting these back:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} A_S(r) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1}} \\int_{S_r(x_0)} \\nabla u(x) \\cdot \\nu(x) \\, r^{-(n-1)} d\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1}} \\int_{S_r(x_0)} \\nabla u(x) \\cdot \\nu(x) \\, d\\sigma(x)\n$$\nRecognizing that $|S_r(x_0)| = \\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1}$ and $\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu}$ is the normal derivative, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} A_S(r) = \\frac{1}{|S_r(x_0)|} \\int_{S_r(x_0)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu} \\, d\\sigma(x)\n$$\nWe now apply the divergence theorem to the vector field $\\nabla u$ on the ball $B_r(x_0)$:\n$$\n\\int_{B_r(x_0)} \\Delta u \\, dx = \\int_{S_r(x_0)} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nu \\, d\\sigma(x) = \\int_{S_r(x_0)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu} \\, d\\sigma(x)\n$$\nBy hypothesis, $u$ is harmonic, so $\\Delta u = 0$ everywhere in $\\Omega$, and thus everywhere in $B_r(x_0)$. The integral on the left is therefore zero.\n$$\n\\int_{B_r(x_0)} 0 \\, dx = 0 \\implies \\int_{S_r(x_0)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu} \\, d\\sigma(x) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the derivative of the average, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} A_S(r) = \\frac{1}{|S_r(x_0)|} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $A_S(r)$ is a constant for all $r \\in (0, R)$ where $\\overline{B_R(x_0)} \\subset \\Omega$. To find the value of this constant, we can evaluate the limit as $r \\to 0^+$.\n$$\n\\text{constant} = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} A_S(r) = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{|S_r(x_0)|} \\int_{S_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, d\\sigma(x)\n$$\nSince $u$ is continuous at $x_0$ (a consequence of $u \\in C^2$), the average value of $u$ over spheres $S_r(x_0)$ that shrink to the point $x_0$ converges to the value of the function at that point, $u(x_0)$. Formally, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, continuity implies there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any $x$ with $|x - x_0|  \\delta$, we have $|u(x) - u(x_0)|  \\epsilon$. For $r  \\delta$, this inequality holds for all $x \\in S_r(x_0)$. Integrating over the sphere and dividing by its area shows that $|A_S(r) - u(x_0)| \\leq \\epsilon$. Thus, the limit is $u(x_0)$.\nSince $A_S(r)$ is constant and its limit as $r \\to 0^+$ is $u(x_0)$, we conclude:\n$$\nA_S(r) = u(x_0)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the ball average, $A_B(r)$.\nThe ball average is defined as\n$$\nA_B(r) := \\frac{1}{|B_r(x_0)|} \\int_{B_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, dx\n$$\nWe use the coarea formula, which allows us to express the integral over the ball $B_r(x_0)$ as an iterated integral involving integrals over concentric spheres $S_\\rho(x_0)$ for $\\rho \\in [0, r]$:\n$$\n\\int_{B_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^r \\left( \\int_{S_\\rho(x_0)} u(x) \\, d\\sigma(x) \\right) d\\rho\n$$\nFrom our previous result for the spherical average, we know that for any $\\rho \\in (0, r]$, $\\frac{1}{|S_\\rho(x_0)|} \\int_{S_\\rho(x_0)} u(x) \\, d\\sigma(x) = u(x_0)$. This can be rearranged to state:\n$$\n\\int_{S_\\rho(x_0)} u(x) \\, d\\sigma(x) = u(x_0) |S_\\rho(x_0)| = u(x_0) (\\omega_{n-1} \\rho^{n-1})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the coarea formula expression:\n$$\n\\int_{B_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^r u(x_0) \\omega_{n-1} \\rho^{n-1} \\, d\\rho\n$$\nSince $u(x_0)$ and $\\omega_{n-1}$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $\\rho$, we can factor them out of the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{B_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, dx = u(x_0) \\omega_{n-1} \\int_0^r \\rho^{n-1} \\, d\\rho = u(x_0) \\omega_{n-1} \\left[ \\frac{\\rho^n}{n} \\right]_0^r = u(x_0) \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{n-1} r^n}{n} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\omega_{n-1} r^n}{n}$ is precisely the volume of the $n$-dimensional ball of radius $r$, $|B_r(x_0)|$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\int_{B_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, dx = u(x_0) |B_r(x_0)|\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ball average:\n$$\nA_B(r) = \\frac{1}{|B_r(x_0)|} \\int_{B_r(x_0)} u(x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{|B_r(x_0)|} \\big( u(x_0) |B_r(x_0)| \\big) = u(x_0)\n$$\nThus, both the spherical and ball averages of a harmonic function $u$ are equal to the value of the function at the center of the sphere/ball, $u(x_0)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the pair $(A_S(r), A_B(r))$.

First, we determine the range of $u$ on $B_{R}(0)$. By the maximum principle for harmonic functions, the supremum and infimum of $u$ on the closed disk $\\overline{B_{R}(0)}$ are attained on its boundary, which is the circle of radius $R$ ($\\rho=R$). On this boundary, $u$ takes the values $R^{k}\\cos(k\\theta)$. Since the range of $\\cos(k\\theta)$ is $[-1, 1]$, the function $u$ on the boundary has a maximum of $R^{k}$ and a minimum of $-R^{k}$. The supremum and infimum over the open disk $B_{R}(0)$ are the same.\n$$ \\sup_{B_{R}(0)} u = R^{k} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\inf_{B_{R}(0)} u = -R^{k} $$\nTo create a nonnegative harmonic function $v$ on $B_{R}(0)$, we add a constant $C$ to $u$: $v(x) = u(x) + C$. For $v$ to be nonnegative, we must have $u(x) + C \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in B_{R}(0)$. This is equivalent to $C \\ge -u(x)$ for all $x$, which means $C \\ge - \\inf_{B_{R}(0)} u$. We choose the smallest such constant, $C = -(-R^{k}) = R^{k}$.\nLet us define the new function:\n$$ v(x_{1}, x_{2}) = u(x_{1}, x_{2}) + R^{k} $$\nThis function $v$ is harmonic on $B_{R}(0)$ as it is the sum of a harmonic function and a constant. It is also nonnegative, since for any $x \\in B_{R}(0)$, $v(x) = u(x) + R^{k} \\ge \\inf_{B_{R}(0)}u + R^{k} = -R^{k} + R^{k} = 0$.\n\nNow, we apply the Harnack inequality. For a nonnegative harmonic function $v$ on a disk $B_{R}(0)$, the value at any point $x$ inside the disk is related to its value at the center by:\n$$ v(0) \\frac{R - |x|}{R + |x|} \\le v(x) \\le v(0) \\frac{R + |x|}{R - |x|} $$\nWe need to calculate $v(0)$. Since $k$ is a positive integer, $u(0) = \\mathrm{Re}(0^{k}) = 0$.\nTherefore, $v(0) = u(0) + R^{k} = 0 + R^{k} = R^{k}$.\nThe Harnack inequality becomes:\n$$ R^{k} \\frac{R - |x|}{R + |x|} \\le v(x) \\le R^{k} \\frac{R + |x|}{R - |x|} $$\nThis inequality holds for all $x \\in B_{R}(0)$. We are interested in the behavior of $u$ on the smaller disk $B_{r}(0)$, where $0  r  R$. For any $x \\in B_{r}(0)$, we have $|x|  r$.\nThe term $\\frac{R+|x|}{R-|x|}$ is an increasing function of $|x|$, so its supremum on $B_{r}(0)$ is approached as $|x| \\to r$. The term $\\frac{R-|x|}{R+|x|}$ is a decreasing function of $|x|$, so its infimum on $B_{r}(0)$ is approached as $|x| \\to r$.\nThus, for all $x \\in B_{r}(0)$, we have:\n$$ R^{k} \\frac{R - r}{R + r} \\le v(x) \\le R^{k} \\frac{R + r}{R - r} $$\nThis implies bounds on the supremum and infimum of $v$ over $B_{r}(0)$:\n$$ \\sup_{B_{r}(0)} v \\le R^{k} \\frac{R+r}{R-r} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\inf_{B_{r}(0)} v \\ge R^{k} \\frac{R-r}{R+r} $$\nThe oscillation of $u$ on $B_{r}(0)$ is $\\operatorname{osc}_{B_{r}(0)}(u) = \\sup_{B_{r}(0)} u - \\inf_{B_{r}(0)} u$.\nSince $u = v - R^{k}$, the oscillation is preserved:\n$$ \\operatorname{osc}_{B_{r}(0)}(u) = \\big(\\sup_{B_{r}(0)} v - R^{k}\\big) - \\big(\\inf_{B_{r}(0)} v - R^{k}\\big) = \\sup_{B_{r}(0)} v - \\inf_{B_{r}(0)} v $$\nNow we can find an upper bound for the oscillation:\n$$ \\operatorname{osc}_{B_{r}(0)}(u) \\le \\left(R^{k} \\frac{R+r}{R-r}\\right) - \\left(R^{k} \\frac{R-r}{R+r}\\right) $$\nFactoring out $R^{k}$ and finding a common denominator:\n$$ \\operatorname{osc}_{B_{r}(0)}(u) \\le R^{k} \\left( \\frac{(R+r)^{2} - (R-r)^{2}}{(R-r)(R+r)} \\right) $$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$ (R+r)^{2} - (R-r)^{2} = (R^{2} + 2Rr + r^{2}) - (R^{2} - 2Rr + r^{2}) = 4Rr $$\nThe denominator is $R^{2} - r^{2}$. Substituting these back gives the upper bound:\n$$ \\operatorname{osc}_{B_{r}(0)}(u) \\le R^{k} \\left( \\frac{4Rr}{R^{2} - r^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{4R^{k+1}r}{R^{2} - r^{2}} $$\nThis is the required upper bound for the oscillation of $u$ on the disk $B_{r}(0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4R^{k+1}r}{R^{2} - r^{2}}}$$", "id": "3052147"}]}
