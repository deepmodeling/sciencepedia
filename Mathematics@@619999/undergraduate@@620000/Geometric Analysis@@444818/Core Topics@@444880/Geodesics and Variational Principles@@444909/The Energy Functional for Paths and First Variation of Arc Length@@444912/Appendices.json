Since the x-component of the velocity is strictly positive ($2 > 0$), the path never reverses direction. It starts at $\\gamma_{1}(0) = (0,0)$ and ends at $\\gamma_{1}(1) = (2,0)$, traversing the segment exactly once in a monotonic fashion from left to right.\n\nFor the path $\\gamma_{2}(t)=(2t^{2},0)$:\nThe domain of the parameter $t$ is also the interval $[0,1]$.\nThe components are $x_{2}(t) = 2t^{2}$ and $y_{2}(t) = 0$.\nAgain, the y-coordinate is identically zero.\nFor the x-coordinate, the function $f(t) = 2t^{2}$ is a strictly increasing function on the interval $[0,1]$. As $t$ varies from $0$ to $1$, $x_{2}(t)$ varies from $x_{2}(0) = 2(0)^{2} = 0$ to $x_{2}(1) = 2(1)^{2} = 2$.\nThus, the image of $\\gamma_{2}$ is also the set $\\{(x,0) | x \\in [0,2]\\}$, the same line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$.\nTo justify monotonic traversal, we examine the velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_{2}(t) = (\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t}, \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t})$.\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{2}(t) = (4t, 0) $$\nFor $t \\in (0,1]$, the x-component of the velocity, $4t$, is strictly positive.

Since $2 = \\frac{6}{3} \\neq \\frac{8}{3}$, the energies are different. This illustrates that the energy functional is dependent on the parametrization, specifically on the speed of traversal.
