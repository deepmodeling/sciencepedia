It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nWe will proceed by following the outlined steps.\n\n**Step 1: The Geodesic Equation in Euclidean Space**\n\nA geodesic is a curve $x(t)$ whose acceleration vector is zero in the sense of covariant differentiation. The covariant acceleration of the curve $x(t)$ is given by the covariant derivative of its velocity vector field $\\dot{x}(t)$ along the curve itself, denoted $\\nabla_{\\dot{x}} \\dot{x}$. The geodesic equation is therefore $\\nabla_{\\dot{x}} \\dot{x} = 0$. In a local coordinate system $\\{x^i\\}$, this equation can be expressed using the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, as a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the component functions $x^k(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2x^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\Gamma^k_{ij}(x(t)) \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0\n$$\nIn more compact notation, this is $\\ddot{x}^k + \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\dot{x}^i \\dot{x}^j = 0$, where summation over repeated indices is implied.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are determined by the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ via the formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $g^{kl}$ are the components of the inverse metric tensor.\n\nThe problem considers the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard Euclidean metric. In standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$, the metric tensor is given by the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. This means its components are constant throughout space: $g_{ij} = 1$ if $i=j$ and $g_{ij} = 0$ if $i \\neq j$.\n\nConsequently, all partial derivatives of the metric components with respect to the coordinates are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial(\\delta_{jl})}{\\partial x^i} = 0\n$$\nfor all $i, j, l$. Substituting these zero-valued derivatives into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0\n$$\nThus, all Christoffel symbols vanish identically in standard Cartesian coordinates on Euclidean space.\n\nWith $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$, the geodesic equation $\\ddot{x}^k + \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\dot{x}^i \\dot{x}^j = 0$ simplifies dramatically to:\n$$\n\\ddot{x}^k(t) = 0\n$$\nfor each component $k=1, \\dots, n$. In vector form, this is $\\ddot{x}(t)=0$. This demonstrates that the covariant acceleration of a curve $x(t)$ in Euclidean space, expressed in Cartesian coordinates, is simply its ordinary second derivative with respect to the parameter $t$.\n\nThe equation $\\ddot{x}(t)=0$ is a system of $n$ second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. To analyze the associated initial value problem, we can rewrite it as a first-order system. Let $v(t) = \\dot{x}(t)$. The system becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x}(t) = v(t) \\\\\n\\dot{v}(t) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be written as a single first-order equation $\\dot{Y}(t) = F(Y(t))$ where $Y(t) = (x(t), v(t))^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and the function $F: \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is given by $F(x,v) = (v,0)$. The function $F$ is a linear mapping and is therefore infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) on its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. A function that is $C^1$ is locally Lipschitz continuous. Since the partial derivatives of $F$ are constant, $F$ is globally Lipschitz continuous.\n\nThe Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for ODEs (also known as the Picard-Lindelöf theorem) states that for an initial value problem $\\dot{Y} = F(Y)$, $Y(0)=Y_0$, if $F$ is Lipschitz continuous, there exists a unique solution defined on some interval containing $t=0$. Because $F$ is globally Lipschitz, this unique solution exists for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, for any given initial position $x(0)$ and initial velocity $\\dot{x}(0)$, there exists a unique geodesic solution $x(t)$ defined for all $t$.\n\n**Step 2: Solving the Initial Value Problem**\n\nWe are tasked with solving the initial value problem in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$:\n$$\n\\ddot{x}(t)=0, \\quad x(0)=p, \\quad \\dot{x}(0)=v\n$$\nwhere $p=\\big(\\ln(3),\\,\\sqrt{5},\\,\\pi,\\,0\\big)$ and $v=\\big(\\exp(1),\\,-\\sqrt{2},\\,1,\\,\\frac{1}{3}\\big)$.\n\nWe solve this by integrating the equation $\\ddot{x}(t)=0$ twice. Integrating with respect to $t$ gives the velocity vector:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = \\int \\ddot{x}(t) dt = \\int 0 dt = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant vector of integration. We use the initial velocity condition $\\dot{x}(0)=v$ to determine $C_1$:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(0) = C_1 = v\n$$\nSo, the velocity is constant: $\\dot{x}(t) = v$.\n\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $t$ gives the position vector:\n$$\nx(t) = \\int \\dot{x}(t) dt = \\int v dt = v t + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is another constant vector of integration. We use the initial position condition $x(0)=p$ to determine $C_2$:\n$$\nx(0) = v(0) + C_2 = p \\implies C_2 = p\n$$\nThus, the unique solution to the initial value problem is:\n$$\nx(t) = p + v t\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Geodesics as Straight Lines**\n\nThe solution $x(t) = p + v t$ is the standard parametric vector equation of a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The line passes through the point $p$ (at $t=0$) and is parallel to the direction vector $v$. Since the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem guarantees that this is the only solution to the geodesic equation with the given initial data $(p,v)$, we conclude that the unique geodesic passing through the point $p$ with initial velocity $v$ is precisely this straight line. This confirms the well-known fact that geodesics in Euclidean space are straight lines.\n\n**Step 4: Computing a Point on the Geodesic**\n\nWe need to compute the point $x(3)$ on this geodesic. We substitute $t=3$ into our solution $x(t) = p + v t$:\n$$\nx(3) = p + 3v\n$$\nSubstituting the given vectors for $p$ and $v$:\n$$\np=\\big(\\ln(3),\\,\\sqrt{5},\\,\\pi,\\,0\\big)\n$$\n$$\nv=\\big(\\exp(1),\\,-\\sqrt{2},\\,1,\\,\\frac{1}{3}\\big)\n$$\nWe compute the components of $x(3)$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1(3) &= \\ln(3) + 3(\\exp(1)) = \\ln(3) + 3\\exp(1) \\\\\nx_2(3) &= \\sqrt{5} + 3(-\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{5} - 3\\sqrt{2} \\\\\nx_3(3) &= \\pi + 3(1) = \\pi + 3 \\\\\nx_4(3) &= 0 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1\n\\end{align*}\nThe resulting point is the $4$-tuple:\n$$\nx(3) = \\big( \\ln(3) + 3\\exp(1), \\; \\sqrt{5} - 3\\sqrt{2}, \\; \\pi + 3, \\; 1 \\big)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\ln(3) + 3\\exp(1) & \\sqrt{5} - 3\\sqrt{2} & \\pi + 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3050052"}, {"introduction": "While geodesics are an intrinsic property of a space, their equations depend on the chosen coordinate system.

For $k=r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 r}{ds^2} + \\Gamma^r_{rr}\\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\right)^2 + 2\\Gamma^r_{r\\theta}\\frac{dr}{ds}\\frac{d\\theta}{ds} + \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{ds}\\right)^2 = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the symbols and using dot notation for derivatives with respect to $s$ (e.g., $\\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{ds}$):\n$$\n\\ddot{r} + (0)\\dot{r}^2 + 2(0)\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} + (-f(r)f'(r))\\dot{\\theta}^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{r} - f(r)f'(r)\\dot{\\theta}^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is the first geodesic equation.\n\nFor $k=\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\theta}{ds^2} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{rr}\\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\right)^2 + 2\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}\\frac{dr}{ds}\\frac{d\\theta}{ds} + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta\\theta}\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{ds}\\right)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{\\theta} + (0)\\dot{r}^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\right)\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} + (0)\\dot{\\theta}^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{2f'(r)}{f(r)}\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} = 0\n$$\nThis is the second geodesic equation.\n\nNext, we establish that the quantity $L = f(r(s))^{2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}(s)$ is conserved along any geodesic. To do this, we differentiate $L$ with respect to the arc-length parameter $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ f(r(s))^{2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}(s) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule and chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{ds} = \\left( \\frac{d}{ds}f(r(s))^{2} \\right) \\dot{\\theta}(s) + f(r(s))^{2} \\ddot{\\theta}(s)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{ds} = \\left( 2f(r)f'(r)\\dot{r} \\right) \\dot{\\theta} + f(r)^{2} \\ddot{\\theta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{ds} = f(r)^{2} \\left[ \\frac{2f'(r)}{f(r)}\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} + \\ddot{\\theta} \\right]\n$$\nThe term in the square brackets is precisely the left-hand side of the second geodesic equation, which is equal to zero. Thus:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{ds} = f(r)^{2} [0] = 0\n$$\nSince the derivative of $L$ with respect to $s$ is zero, $L$ must be a constant along the geodesic. This conserved quantity is a manifestation of Clairaut's relation, arising from the symmetry of the metric under rotations (independence of $g_{ij}$ from $\\theta$).\n\nFinally, we compute the value of this constant of motion using the given initial conditions. The constant $L$ can be evaluated at any point on the curve, so we evaluate it at $s=0$:\n$$\nL = f(r(0))^{2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}(0) = f(r_0)^{2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}(0)\n$$\nWe need to determine $\\dot{\\theta}(0)$. The tangent vector to the curve is $\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = \\dot{r}(s)\\partial_r + \\dot{\\theta}(s)\\partial_\\theta$. At $s=0$, it is $\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = \\dot{r}(0)\\partial_r + \\dot{\\theta}(0)\\partial_\\theta$.\nSince the curve is unit-speed, the squared norm of the tangent vector is $1$:\n$$\n\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(s)\\|^2 = g_{ij}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = g_{rr}\\dot{r}^2 + g_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}^2 = \\dot{r}(s)^2 + f(r(s))^2\\dot{\\theta}(s)^2 = 1\n$$\nAt $s=0$, this gives:\n$$\n\\dot{r}(0)^2 + f(r_0)^2\\dot{\\theta}(0)^2 = 1\n$$\nThe problem states that the initial tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ makes an angle $\\psi_0$ with the meridian direction $\\partial_r$. The 'meridian direction' is the direction of the vector field $\\partial_r$. The angle between two vectors $u$ and $v$ is given by $\\cos(\\psi_0) = \\frac{\\langle u, v \\rangle}{\\|u\\| \\|v\\|}$, where the inner product is induced by the metric $g_{ij}$.\nLet $u = \\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ and $v = \\partial_r$. We have $\\|u\\| = \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(0)\\| = 1$. The norm of $v=\\partial_r$ is $\\|v\\|^2 = \\langle \\partial_r, \\partial_r \\rangle = g_{rr} = 1$, so $\\|v\\|=1$.\nThe inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(0), \\partial_r \\rangle = g_{ij}\\dot{\\gamma}^i(0) (\\partial_r)^j = g_{r r}\\dot{r}(0)(1) + g_{r \\theta}\\dot{\\theta}(0)(1) + \\dots = \\dot{r}(0)\n$$\nSo, $\\cos(\\psi_0) = \\frac{\\dot{r}(0)}{(1)(1)} = \\dot{r}(0)$.\nWe can now substitute $\\dot{r}(0) = \\cos(\\psi_0)$ into the unit-speed condition at $s=0$:\n$$\n\\cos^2(\\psi_0) + f(r_0)^2\\dot{\\theta}(0)^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\nf(r_0)^2\\dot{\\theta}(0)^2 = 1 - \\cos^2(\\psi_0) = \\sin^2(\\psi_0)\n$$\nTaking the square root, and noting that $f(r_0)>0$ by definition:\n$$\nf(r_0)|\\dot{\\theta}(0)| = |\\sin(\\psi_0)|\n$$\nWe can relate $f(r_0)\\dot{\\theta}(0)$ directly to $\\sin(\\psi_0)$. An orthonormal basis at $(r_0, \\theta_0)$ is $\\{e_r, e_\\theta\\} = \\{\\partial_r, \\frac{1}{f(r_0)}\\partial_\\theta\\}$. The tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ can be written in this basis as:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = \\dot{r}(0)\\partial_r + \\dot{\\theta}(0)\\partial_\\theta = \\dot{r}(0)e_r + \\left(f(r_0)\\dot{\\theta}(0)\\right)e_\\theta\n$$\nSince $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ is a unit vector and $\\psi_0$ is the angle it makes with $e_r = \\partial_r$, its components in this orthonormal basis are $(\\cos(\\psi_0), \\sin(\\psi_0))$.\nTherefore, we have $\\dot{r}(0) = \\cos(\\psi_0)$ and $f(r_0)\\dot{\\theta}(0) = \\sin(\\psi_0)$.\n\nNow we compute the conserved quantity $L$:\n$$\nL = f(r_0)^{2}\\,\\dot{\\theta}(0) = f(r_0) \\left( f(r_0)\\dot{\\theta}(0) \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $f(r_0)\\dot{\\theta}(0) = \\sin(\\psi_0)$:\n$$\nL = f(r_0)\\sin(\\psi_0)\n$$\nThis is the value of the conserved quantity $f(r(s))^2 \\dot{\\theta}(s)$ for all $s$ along the geodesic, expressed in terms of the initial data.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{f(r_0)\\sin(\\psi_0)}\n$$", "id": "3050058"}]}
