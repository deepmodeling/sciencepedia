Finally, we find the smallest positive time $t_c$ for which a non-trivial solution exists and determine the corresponding point on the sphere.\n\n**Step 1: Parametrization of the Geodesic**\n\nThe geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starts at $N = (0, 0, 1)$ with initial velocity $\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = (1, 0, 0)$. Since the starting point is on the z-axis and the initial velocity is purely in the x-direction, the geodesic must be the great circle lying in the $xz$-plane.

The magnitude $|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2 t + (-\\sin t)^2} = 1$, confirming it is an arc-length parametrization.\n\n**Step 2: Setting up the Jacobi Equation**\n\nThe Jacobi equation is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nWe use the given formula for the curvature tensor on $S^2$:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma(t)$ is arc-length parametrized, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = |\\dot{\\gamma}|^2 = 1$. The Jacobi field $J(t)$ is tangent to the sphere, so it is orthogonal to the normal vector $\\gamma(t)$. The velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ is also tangent to the sphere. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nTo solve this vector differential equation, we introduce a convenient basis for the tangent space at each point $\\gamma(t)$. We can use a parallel orthonormal frame along the geodesic. Let $e_1(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t) = (\\cos t, 0, -\\sin t)$. The second basis vector must be orthogonal to $e_1(t)$ and to the normal vector $\\gamma(t) = (\\sin t, 0, \\cos t)$. A natural choice is the constant vector $e_2(t) = (0, 1, 0)$. Let's check that it's tangent along the geodesic: $\\langle e_2(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = \\langle (0,1,0), (\\sin t, 0, \\cos t) \\rangle = 0$. So it is a valid tangent vector. The set $\\{e_1(t), e_2(t)\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$.\n\nThis frame is also parallel along $\\gamma$. For $e_1 = \\dot{\\gamma}$, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} e_1 = 0$ by the definition of a geodesic. For $e_2$, the covariant derivative is the projection of the standard derivative onto the tangent space. Since $e_2$ is a constant vector, its standard derivative is zero, so its covariant derivative is also zero. Thus, $\\{e_1(t), e_2(t)\\}$ is a parallel frame.\n\nWe can express the Jacobi field in this basis: $J(t) = j_1(t) e_1(t) + j_2(t) e_2(t)$.\nSince the frame is parallel, the covariant derivative simplifies: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J = \\dot{j_1} e_1 + \\dot{j_2} e_2$, and $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J = \\ddot{j_1} e_1 + \\ddot{j_2} e_2$.\nAlso note that $\\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = \\langle j_1 e_1 + j_2 e_2, e_1 \\rangle = j_1$.\nSubstituting these into the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n(\\ddot{j_1} e_1 + \\ddot{j_2} e_2) + (j_1 e_1 + j_2 e_2) - j_1 e_1 = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{j_1} e_1 + (\\ddot{j_2} + j_2) e_2 = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nSince $e_1$ and $e_2$ are linearly independent, their coefficients must be zero. This gives two uncoupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the component functions:\n1. $\\ddot{j_1}(t) = 0$\n2. $\\ddot{j_2}(t) + j_2(t) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Solving the ODEs with Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe general solution for the first ODE is $j_1(t) = A t + B$.\nThe general solution for the second ODE is $j_2(t) = C \\cos(t) + D \\sin(t)$.\n\nThe first boundary condition is $J(0) = \\mathbf{0}$. This means $j_1(0) = 0$ and $j_2(0) = 0$.\n$j_1(0) = A(0) + B = 0 \\implies B=0$. So, $j_1(t) = At$.\n$j_2(0) = C \\cos(0) + D \\sin(0) = C = 0$. So, $j_2(t) = D \\sin(t)$.\n\nThus, any Jacobi field vanishing at $t=0$ must be of the form $J(t) = (At) e_1(t) + (D \\sin t) e_2(t)$.\nA non-zero Jacobi field requires that not both $A$ and $D$ are zero.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the First Conjugate Point**\n\nA conjugate point occurs at time $t_c > 0$ where $J(t_c) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$J(t_c) = (A t_c) e_1(t_c) + (D \\sin t_c) e_2(t_c) = \\mathbf{0}$.\nAgain, since $e_1(t_c)$ and $e_2(t_c)$ are linearly independent, the coefficients must be zero:\n1. $A t_c = 0$\n2. $D \\sin(t_c) = 0$\n\nWe seek a non-trivial solution (non-zero $J$), so at least one of $A$ or $D$ is non-zero.\nIf we chose $A \\neq 0$ and $D=0$, then $A t_c = 0$ would imply $t_c=0$, which contradicts the condition $t_c > 0$.\nSo, we must have $A=0$ and $D \\neq 0$. The condition then simplifies to $D \\sin(t_c) = 0$, which means $\\sin(t_c) = 0$.\nThe solutions for $t_c > 0$ are $t_c = k\\pi$ for any positive integer $k=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe first conjugate point corresponds to the smallest positive value of $t_c$, which is $t_c = \\pi$ (for $k=1$).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Coordinates of the Conjugate Point**\n\nThe location of the first conjugate point is given by evaluating the geodesic at $t_c = \\pi$:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\pi) = (\\sin \\pi, 0, \\cos \\pi) = (0, 0, -1)\n$$\nThis point is the south pole, the antipode of the starting north pole.
