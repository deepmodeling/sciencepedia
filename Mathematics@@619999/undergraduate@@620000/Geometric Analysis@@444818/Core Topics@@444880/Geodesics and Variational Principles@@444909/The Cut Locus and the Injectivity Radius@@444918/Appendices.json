The derivation must be based on the provided fundamental principles.\n\nLet $(S^n, g)$ be the $n$-sphere of radius $1$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. A point $p \\in S^n$ can be viewed as a unit vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The tangent space $T_p S^n$ is the $n$-dimensional hyperplane in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ consisting of vectors orthogonal to $p$.\n\nThe problem states that geodesics on $(S^n, g)$ are great circles. A unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p = \\gamma(0)$ with initial velocity $v = \\gamma'(0)$, where $v \\in T_pS^n$ and $\\|v\\|_g = 1$, lies on the great circle determined by the $2$-plane spanned by the orthogonal vectors $p$ and $v$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The explicit parameterization of this geodesic in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is given by:\n$$ \\gamma(t) = p \\cos(t) + v \\sin(t) $$\nHere, $t$ represents the arc length, which on a unit sphere is equal to the angle in radians from the starting point.\n\nThe cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$ is the set of points where geodesics from $p$ first cease to be minimizing. For a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold like the sphere $S^n$, the cut locus of a point $p$ is identical to the set of first conjugate points to $p$ along all geodesics emanating from $p$. A point $q = \\gamma(t_0)$ is conjugate to $p = \\gamma(0)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(t_0) = 0$.\n\nWe use the provided Jacobi equation, $D^2J/dt^2 + R(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}=0$. The problem specifies that the sectional curvature of $(S^n,g)$ is constant, $K=1$. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Jacobi equation for a field $J(t)$ orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ simplifies significantly. Let $\\{e_2(t), \\dots, e_n(t)\\}$ be a parallel-transported orthonormal basis for the subspace of $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^n$ orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. We can express $J(t)$ as $J(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n y_i(t) e_i(t)$. The Jacobi equation then reduces to a system of scalar ordinary differential equations for the component functions $y_i(t)$:\n$$ y_i''(t) + K y_i(t) = 0 $$\nWith $K=1$, we have:\n$$ y_i''(t) + y_i(t) = 0 $$\nThe general solution for each component $y_i(t)$ is $y_i(t) = A_i \\cos(t) + B_i \\sin(t)$, where $A_i$ and $B_i$ are constants.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ originates from a variation of geodesics all starting at $p$, which imposes the initial condition $J(0)=0$. This implies $y_i(0)=0$ for all $i=2, \\dots, n$.\nSubstituting $t=0$ into the general solution gives $y_i(0) = A_i \\cos(0) + B_i \\sin(0) = A_i$. Thus, we must have $A_i=0$ for all $i$.\nThe Jacobi field must therefore be of the form:\n$$ J(t) = \\left( \\sum_{i=2}^n B_i e_i(t) \\right) \\sin(t) $$\nFor this Jacobi field to be non-trivial, at least one constant $B_i$ must be non-zero. This corresponds to a non-trivial variation of the geodesic $\\gamma$.\n\nA point $\\gamma(t_0)$ with $t_0 > 0$ is conjugate to $p=\\gamma(0)$ if $J(t_0) = 0$ for some non-trivial $J(t)$. This condition translates to:\n$$ \\left( \\sum_{i=2}^n B_i e_i(t_0) \\right) \\sin(t_0) = 0 $$\nSince not all $B_i$ are zero and $\\{e_i(t_0)\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis, the vector sum is non-zero. Therefore, we must have $\\sin(t_0) = 0$.\nThe smallest positive value of $t_0$ that satisfies this condition is $t_0 = \\pi$.\n\nThis means that the first conjugate point to $p$ along any unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma$ occurs at a distance of $t=\\pi$. To identify the location of this conjugate point, we use the explicit formula for the geodesic:\n$$ \\gamma(\\pi) = p \\cos(\\pi) + v \\sin(\\pi) = p(-1) + v(0) = -p $$\nThis result shows that, regardless of the initial direction $v \\in T_pS^n$, the first conjugate point along any geodesic from $p$ is the antipodal point $-p$. The set of first conjugate points along all geodesics from $p$ consists of this single point.\nTherefore, the cut locus of $p$ is $\\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$.\n\nThe injectivity radius at $p$, $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is defined as the distance from $p$ to its cut locus. Formally, $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\inf_{q \\in \\operatorname{Cut}(p)} d(p,q)$. Since the cut locus consists of the single point $-p$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, -p) $$\nThe distance $d(p, -p)$ is the length of a minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $-p$. We found that the geodesics from $p$ reach $-p$ at arc length $t=\\pi$. This path length is the shortest possible distance between $p$ and $-p$ on the sphere. Thus, $d(p, -p) = \\pi$.\nThis corresponds to traveling halfway around a great circle on the unit sphere.\n\nIn conclusion, the cut locus of any point $p \\in S^n$ is its antipodal point $\\{-p\\}$, and the injectivity radius is the distance to this point, which is $\\pi$. This value matches the definition of the injectivity radius as the supremum of radii $r>0$ for which the exponential map $\\exp_p: B_r(0) \\subset T_pS^n \\to S^n$ is a diffeomorphism. The map fails to be injective for $r=\\pi$ because the entire boundary of the ball of radius $\\pi$ in $T_pS^n$ is mapped to the single point $-p$. The exact value of the injectivity radius is therefore $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "3068120"}, {"introduction": "While curvature can create a cut locus, a manifold's global topology can have the same effect, even in a perfectly flat space.
