There are no scientific or factual contradictions, no ambiguities in terminology, and no missing information. The problem is a foundational calculation in its field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expression for the density ratio:\n$$\n\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r) = \\frac{\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right)}{\\omega_{m}\\, r^{m}}\n$$\nWe must first analyze the numerator, $\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right)$. This term represents the $m$-dimensional measure of the intersection of the affine plane $M$ and the open ball $B_{r}(x_{0})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nBy definition, $M$ is an $m$-dimensional affine plane. Since it contains the point $x_0$, it can be represented as the translation of an $m$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $V$ be this $m$-dimensional vector subspace. Then, $M = x_0 + V = \\{x_0 + v : v \\in V\\}$.\n\nThe intersection $M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})$ is the set of points $y \\in M$ such that $|y - x_0| < r$. Since any $y \\in M$ can be written as $y = x_0 + v$ for a unique $v \\in V$, the condition becomes:\n$$\n|(x_{0} + v) - x_{0}| < r\n$$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$$\n|v| < r\n$$\nThis means that the intersection $M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})$ corresponds to the set of points $\\{x_0 + v : v \\in V, |v| < r\\}$. Let's call the set of vectors $\\{v \\in V : |v| < r\\}$ as $B_r^V(0)$. This is an $m$-dimensional open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin within the subspace $V$. Thus, the intersection is $x_0 + B_r^V(0)$.\n\nNow, we use the fundamental properties of the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^{m}$.\n1.  **Invariance under Euclidean Isometries**: $\\mathcal{H}^m$ is invariant under translations and rotations.\n    -   Using invariance under the translation by $-x_0$, we have:\n        $$\n        \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(x_0 + B_r^V(0)\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^V(0)\\right)\n        $$\n    -   The $m$-dimensional linear subspace $V$ is isometrically isomorphic to the standard Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^m$. Let $T: V \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear isometry. Such a map preserves norms, so it maps the ball $B_r^V(0)$ in $V$ to the standard $m$-dimensional ball $B_r^m(0) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : |z| < r\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. The Hausdorff measure is invariant under this isometry $T$:\n        $$\n        \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^V(0)\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(T(B_r^V(0))\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^m(0)\\right)\n        $$\n    Combining these steps, the numerator becomes $\\mathcal{H}^{m}(B_r^m(0))$.\n\n2.  **Homogeneity under Dilations**: For any measurable set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$ and any scaling factor $\\lambda > 0$, the Hausdorff measure obeys the scaling law $\\mathcal{H}^m(\\lambda A) = \\lambda^m \\mathcal{H}^m(A)$.\n    The ball $B_r^m(0)$ can be expressed as a dilation of the unit ball $B_1^m(0)$ by a factor of $r$. That is, $B_r^m(0) = r \\cdot B_1^m(0)$. Applying the scaling property with $\\lambda=r$:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_r^m(0)\\right) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(r \\cdot B_1^m(0)\\right) = r^m \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(B_1^m(0)\\right)\n    $$\n\nBy definition given in the problem, $\\omega_m = \\mathcal{H}^{m}(B_1^m(0))$, which is the volume of the unit $m$-ball.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the numerator, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\!\\left(M \\cap B_{r}(x_{0})\\right) = r^m \\omega_m\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the density ratio $\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r)$ by substituting this result back into the original formula:\n$$\n\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r) = \\frac{r^m \\omega_m}{\\omega_m r^m}\n$$\nProvided that $r > 0$ and $\\omega_m > 0$ (which is true for any integer $m \\ge 1$), the terms $\\omega_m$ and $r^m$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n$$\n\\theta_{M}(x_{0},r) = 1\n$$\nThe result is the constant value $1$. This result is independent of the radius $r$ (for $r > 0$) and the choice of point $x_0$ (as long as $x_0 \\in M$).

The task is a direct computation based on these definitions, a common exercise in the study of rectifiable sets and minimal surfaces. The problem does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles, contains no ambiguities, and is not based on false premises. Its structure is sound, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nWe are asked to compute the density ratio $\\theta_{x_{0}}(r)$ for a measure $\\mu$ supported on an $m$-dimensional affine plane $P^{m}$ with constant multiplicity $q$. The definition is given as:\n$$\n\\theta_{x_{0}}(r) = \\frac{\\mu\\big(B_{r}(x_{0})\\big)}{\\omega_{m} \\, r^{m}}\n$$\nwhere $x_{0} \\in P^{m}$ and $r > 0$.\n\nThe first step is to analyze the numerator, $\\mu\\big(B_{r}(x_{0})\\big)$. The measure $\\mu$ is defined as $\\mu = q \\, \\mathcal{H}^{m} \\llcorner P^{m}$. By the definition of the restriction of a measure, for any measurable set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we have $(\\mathcal{H}^{m} \\llcorner P^{m})(A) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}(A \\cap P^{m})$.\nApplying this to our case, where the set is the ball $B_{r}(x_{0})$, we get:\n$$\n\\mu\\big(B_{r}(x_{0})\\big) = \\left(q \\, \\mathcal{H}^{m} \\llcorner P^{m}\\right)\\big(B_{r}(x_{0})\\big) = q \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}(x_{0}) \\cap P^{m}\\big)\n$$\nNow we must identify the set $B_{r}(x_{0}) \\cap P^{m}$ and compute its $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure.\nThe set $P^{m}$ is an $m$-dimensional affine plane in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The set $B_{r}(x_{0})$ is an $n$-dimensional open ball of radius $r$. Crucially, the center of the ball, $x_{0}$, is an element of the plane $P^{m}$.\nThe intersection of an $m$-dimensional affine plane with an $n$-dimensional ball centered on that plane is an $m$-dimensional ball of the same radius, lying within the plane.\nLet us make this rigorous. Since $P^{m}$ is an affine plane containing $x_{0}$, there exists a corresponding $m$-dimensional vector subspace $V^{m} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $P^{m} = x_{0} + V^{m}$. Any point $y \\in P^{m}$ can be written as $y = x_{0} + v$ for some $v \\in V^{m}$. The condition for $y$ to also be in $B_{r}(x_{0})$ is that the Euclidean distance $\\|y - x_{0}\\|$ is less than $r$. Substituting $y = x_{0} + v$, this becomes $\\|(x_{0}+v) - x_{0}\\| < r$, which simplifies to $\\|v\\| < r$.\nThus, the intersection $B_{r}(x_{0}) \\cap P^{m}$ consists of all points $x_{0}+v$ where $v \\in V^{m}$ and $\\|v\\| < r$. This is precisely an $m$-dimensional ball of radius $r$ centered at $x_{0}$ within the affine space $P^{m}$. We denote this set as $B_{r}^{P^{m}}(x_{0})$.\n\nOur task reduces to computing $\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}^{P^{m}}(x_{0})\\big)$. The Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^{m}$ is invariant under Euclidean isometries. We can find an isometry $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that maps the affine plane $P^{m}$ to the standard coordinate plane $\\mathbb{R}^{m} \\times \\{0\\}^{n-m}$ and maps the specific point $x_{0} \\in P^{m}$ to the origin $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nUnder this isometry, the set $B_{r}^{P^{m}}(x_{0})$ is mapped to the standard $m$-dimensional ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$, which we denote by $B_{r}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)$.\nBecause $\\mathcal{H}^{m}$ is invariant under isometries, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}^{P^{m}}(x_{0})\\big) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)\\big)\n$$\nNext, we use the scaling property of the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. For a scalar $\\lambda > 0$ and a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, $\\mathcal{H}^{m}(\\lambda A) = \\lambda^{m}\\mathcal{H}^{m}(A)$.\nThe ball $B_{r}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)$ is a scaled version of the unit ball $B_{1}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)$, specifically $B_{r}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0) = r \\cdot B_{1}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)$.\nApplying the scaling property with $\\lambda=r$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)\\big) = r^{m} \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{1}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)\\big)\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the definition $\\omega_{m} := \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{1}^{\\mathbb{R}^{m}}(0)\\big)$.\nSubstituting this in, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}(x_{0}) \\cap P^{m}\\big) = \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}^{P^{m}}(x_{0})\\big) = r^{m} \\omega_{m}\n$$\nNow we can compute the value of the numerator of the density ratio:\n$$\n\\mu\\big(B_{r}(x_{0})\\big) = q \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(B_{r}(x_{0}) \\cap P^{m}\\big) = q \\cdot r^{m} \\omega_{m}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression back into the definition of $\\theta_{x_{0}}(r)$:\n$$\n\\theta_{x_{0}}(r) = \\frac{\\mu\\big(B_{r}(x_{0})\\big)}{\\omega_{m} \\, r^{m}} = \\frac{q \\, r^{m} \\omega_{m}}{\\omega_{m} \\, r^{m}}\n$$\nSince $r>0$ and $\\omega_{m} > 0$ for $m \\geq 1$ (the problem is implicitly for $m \\geq 1$ as $\\omega_0$ is usually defined differently or the context implies dimension greater than 0), the term $\\omega_{m} r^{m}$ is non-zero, and we can cancel it from the numerator and denominator.\n$$\n\\theta_{x_{0}}(r) = q\n$$\nThe result is the integer $q$. This expression is independent of the radius $r$ (for all $r>0$) and of the center point $x_{0}$ (for all $x_{0} \\in P^{m}$). This verifies the claim made in the problem statement.
