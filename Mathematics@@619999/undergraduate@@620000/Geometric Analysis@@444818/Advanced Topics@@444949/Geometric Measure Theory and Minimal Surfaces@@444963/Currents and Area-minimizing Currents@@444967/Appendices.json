The orientation is the standard one induced by the increasing coordinate $x$, and the multiplicity is given as $1$. The action of a $k$-dimensional current $T$, associated with a $k$-rectifiable set $M$ with orientation $\\xi$ and integer multiplicity function $\\theta$, on a smooth $k$-form $\\omega$ is defined by the integral:\n$$ T(\\omega) = \\int_M \\langle \\omega(x), \\xi(x) \\rangle \\theta(x) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^k(x) $$\nIn the given problem, we have the following specifications:\n- The dimension of the current is $k=1$.\n- The rectifiable set is the interval $M = I = [0,1]$.\n- The multiplicity function is constant, $\\theta(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in I$.\n- The standard orientation of $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is given by the unit tangent vector field pointing in the direction of the increasing coordinate. In the basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\}$, this corresponds to the tangent vector $\\xi(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\n- The differential form is a smooth, compactly supported $1$-form $\\omega = f(x) \\, dx$.\n- The $1$-dimensional Hausdorff measure, $\\mathcal{H}^1$, on the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ coincides with the standard Lebesgue measure, so the measure element is $d\\mathcal{H}^1(x) = dx$.\n\nThe term $\\langle \\omega(x), \\xi(x) \\rangle$ represents the evaluation of the $1$-form $\\omega$ at the point $x$ on the tangent vector $\\xi(x)$. By the definition of how $1$-forms act on vector fields, we have:\n$$ \\langle \\omega(x), \\xi(x) \\rangle = (f(x) \\, dx)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) = f(x) $$\nSubstituting all these elements into the definition of the current's action, we obtain:\n$$ [I](\\omega) = \\int_{[0,1]} f(x) \\cdot 1 \\cdot dx = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx $$\nThis expression gives the value of $[I](\\omega)$ in terms of the function $f$.\n\n**Part 2: Deduction of the boundary $\\partial[I]$**\n\nThe boundary $\\partial T$ of a $k$-current $T$ is defined as the $(k-1)$-current whose action on any smooth, compactly supported $(k-1)$-form $\\psi$ is given by the general form of Stokes' theorem:\n$$ (\\partial T)(\\psi) = T(d\\psi) $$\nIn our case, $T = [I]$ is a $1$-current, so its boundary $\\partial[I]$ is a $0$-current. A $0$-current acts on $0$-forms, which are smooth functions. Let $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be an arbitrary smooth, compactly supported test function (a $0$-form), as specified in the problem. The action of $\\partial[I]$ on $\\varphi$ is given by:\n$$ (\\partial[I])(\\varphi) = [I](d\\varphi) $$\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative $d\\varphi$ of the $0$-form $\\varphi$. For a function on $\\mathbb{R}$, this is:\n$$ d\\varphi = \\frac{d\\varphi}{dx} \\, dx = \\varphi'(x) \\, dx $$\nThe result, $d\\varphi$, is a $1$-form. We can now use the result from Part $1$ to evaluate $[I](d\\varphi)$. The formula derived was $[I](\\omega) = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx$ for $\\omega = f(x) \\, dx$. In the current context, the role of the function $f(x)$ is played by $\\varphi'(x)$. This substitution gives:\n$$ (\\partial[I])(\\varphi) = [I](\\varphi'(x) \\, dx) = \\int_0^1 \\varphi'(x) \\, dx $$\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we evaluate this definite integral:\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\varphi'(x) \\, dx = [\\varphi(x)]_0^1 = \\varphi(1) - \\varphi(0) $$\nThus, we have established that for any smooth, compactly supported test function $\\varphi$, $(\\partial[I])(\\varphi) = \\varphi(1) - \\varphi(0)$.\n\nNow, we must relate this result to the current $\\delta_{1}-\\delta_{0}$. The current $\\delta_p$ is the Dirac delta current centered at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As a $0$-current, its action on a test function $\\varphi$ is defined as evaluation at the point $p$:\n$$ \\delta_p(\\varphi) = \\varphi(p) $$\nThe action of the current $\\delta_1 - \\delta_0$ on $\\varphi$ is then defined by linearity:\n$$ (\\delta_1 - \\delta_0)(\\varphi) = \\delta_1(\\varphi) - \\delta_0(\\varphi) = \\varphi(1) - \\varphi(0) $$\nBy comparing the two results, we see that $(\\partial[I])(\\varphi) = (\\delta_1 - \\delta_0)(\\varphi)$ for all valid test functions $\\varphi$. By the definition of equality of currents (two currents are equal if they agree on all test forms), we conclude that:\n$$ \\partial[I] = \\delta_1 - \\delta_0 $$\nThis confirms the geometric intuition that the oriented boundary of the interval $[0,1]$ consists of the endpoint $1$ (with positive orientation) and the start point $0$ (with negative orientation).\n\nThe final answer requested is the expression for $[I](\\omega)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx}$$", "id": "3044380"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a one-dimensional current, we now move to a two-dimensional example in the plane.
