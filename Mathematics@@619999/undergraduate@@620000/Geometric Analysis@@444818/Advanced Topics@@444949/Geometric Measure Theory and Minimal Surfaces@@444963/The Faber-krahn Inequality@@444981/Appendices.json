We use the scaling transformation $y = tx$, which maps $\\Omega$ to $t\\Omega$. For any test function $v$ on $t\\Omega$, we can define a function $u$ on $\\Omega$ via the composition $u(x) = v(tx)$. Conversely, for any $u$ on $\\Omega$, we can define $v(y) = u(y/t)$ on $t\\Omega$. This establishes a bijection between the function spaces $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ and $H_{0}^{1}(t\\Omega)$. Consequently, we can rewrite the infimum over functions $v$ on $t\\Omega$ as an infimum over functions $u$ on $\\Omega$.\n\nLet's transform the numerator and denominator of the Rayleigh quotient separately.\n\nFirst, we analyze the Dirichlet energy integral, $\\int_{t\\Omega} |\\nabla_y v(y)|^{2} \\, dy$. Let $v(y) = u(y/t)$. We need to relate the gradient of $v$ with respect to $y$, denoted $\\nabla_y v$, to the gradient of $u$ with respect to $x$, denoted $\\nabla_x u$. Using the chain rule, and letting $x(y) = y/t$, we have:\n$$ \\nabla_y v(y) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x(y)) \\cdot J_{x(y)} $$\nwhere $J_{x(y)}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation $x(y)$. Its components are $\\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial y_j} = \\frac{1}{t}\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The Jacobian matrix is $\\frac{1}{t}I_n$, with $I_n$ being the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. Thus, the gradient vectors are related by:\n$$ \\nabla_y v(y) = \\frac{1}{t}\\nabla_x u(x) $$\nThe squared norm of the gradient is then:\n$$ |\\nabla_y v(y)|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{t}\\nabla_x u(x)\\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{t^2}|\\nabla_x u(x)|^2 $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the change of variables formula. With the transformation $y = tx$, the differential volume element $dy$ is related to $dx$ by $dy = |\\det(J_{y(x)})| dx$. The Jacobian of the map $y(x)=tx$ is $t I_n$, and its determinant is $t^n$. So, $dy = t^n dx$. The Dirichlet energy integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{t\\Omega} |\\nabla_y v(y)|^{2} \\, dy = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(\\frac{1}{t^2}|\\nabla_x u(x)|^2\\right) (t^n \\, dx) = t^{n-2} \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla_x u(x)|^{2} \\, dx $$\n\nNext, we analyze the $L^2$ mass integral, $\\int_{t\\Omega} |v(y)|^2 \\, dy$. Using the same change of variables $y = tx$ and $dy = t^n dx$, and the relation $|v(y)|^2 = |u(x)|^2$, we get:\n$$ \\int_{t\\Omega} |v(y)|^2 \\, dy = \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^2 (t^n \\, dx) = t^n \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^2 \\, dx $$\n\nNow we can substitute these two results back into the Rayleigh quotient for a function $v$ on $t\\Omega$, expressed in terms of its corresponding function $u$ on $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\frac{\\int_{t\\Omega} |\\nabla_y v(y)|^{2} \\, dy}{\\int_{t\\Omega} |v(y)|^{2} \\, dy} = \\frac{t^{n-2} \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla_x u(x)|^{2} \\, dx}{t^n \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2} \\, dx} = \\frac{1}{t^2} \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2} \\, dx}{\\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2} \\, dx} $$\n\nFinally, to find $\\lambda_1(t\\Omega)$, we take the infimum over all valid test functions. Since the mapping from $u$ to $v$ is a bijection between the sets of admissible functions, we can write:\n$$ \\lambda_1(t\\Omega) = \\inf_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\not\\equiv 0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{t^2} \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2} \\, dx}{\\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2} \\, dx} \\right] $$\nThe constant factor $t^{-2}$ is independent of the function $u$, so it can be pulled out of the infimum:\n$$ \\lambda_1(t\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{t^2} \\inf_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\not\\equiv 0} \\left[ \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2} \\, dx}{\\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2} \\, dx} \\right] = \\frac{1}{t^2} \\lambda_{1}(\\Omega) $$\nThis shows that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue scales inversely with the square of the dilation factor.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit form of the scaling function $K(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}(t\\Omega)}{\\lambda_{1}(\\Omega)}$. From the derived relation, we divide by $\\lambda_{1}(\\Omega)$ (which is strictly positive for a bounded domain) to obtain:\n$$ K(t) = \\frac{1}{t^2} $$\nThis expression can also be written as $t^{-2}$.
