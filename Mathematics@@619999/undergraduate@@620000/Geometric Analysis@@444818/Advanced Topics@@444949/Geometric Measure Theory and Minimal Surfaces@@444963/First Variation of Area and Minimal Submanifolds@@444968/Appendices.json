Its derivative is $\\frac{dr}{dz} = \\sinh(\\frac{z}{a})$.\n    The area element for the surface of revolution is $2\\pi r(z) \\sqrt{1 + (\\frac{dr}{dz})^2} dz$.\n    The term under the square root is $1 + \\sinh^2(\\frac{z}{a}) = \\cosh^2(\\frac{z}{a})$.\n    So, $\\sqrt{1 + (\\frac{dr}{dz})^2} = \\cosh(\\frac{z}{a})$.\n    The area of the neck is given by the integral:\n    $$A_{neck}(z_0) = 2\\pi \\int_{-z_0}^{z_0} r(z) \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{dr}{dz}\\right)^2} dz = 2\\pi \\int_{-z_0}^{z_0} a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right) dz$$\n    $$A_{neck}(z_0) = 2\\pi a \\int_{-z_0}^{z_0} \\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right) dz$$\n    Using the identity $\\cosh^2(u) = \\frac{1 + \\cosh(2u)}{2}$:\n    $$A_{neck}(z_0) = 2\\pi a \\int_{-z_0}^{z_0} \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{2z}{a}\\right)\\right) dz = \\pi a \\left[ z + \\frac{a}{2}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2z}{a}\\right) \\right]_{-z_0}^{z_0}$$\n    $$A_{neck}(z_0) = \\pi a \\left[ \\left(z_0 + \\frac{a}{2}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right)\\right) - \\left(-z_0 + \\frac{a}{2}\\sinh\\left(-\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right)\\right) \\right]$$\n    Since $\\sinh$ is an odd function, $\\sinh(-x) = -\\sinh(x)$:\n    $$A_{neck}(z_0) = \\pi a \\left( 2z_0 + a\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right) \\right) = 2\\pi a z_0 + \\pi a^2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Area of the two capping disks, $A_{disks}(z_0)$:**\n    The disks are at $z = \\pm z_0$, and their radius is $r_0 = a \\cosh(\\frac{z_0}{a})$.\n    The area of one disk is $\\pi r_0^2 = \\pi a^2 \\cosh^2(\\frac{z_0}{a})$.\n    The total area of the two disks is:\n    $$A_{disks}(z_0) = 2\\pi a^2 \\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{z_0}{a}\\right)$$\n    Using the identity $\\cosh^2(u) = \\frac{1 + \\cosh(2u)}{2}$ again:\n    $$A_{disks}(z_0) = 2\\pi a^2 \\left(\\frac{1 + \\cosh(2z_0/a)}{2}\\right) = \\pi a^2 \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right)\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Area difference, $\\Delta A = A_{neck}(z_0) - A_{disks}(z_0)$:**\n    $$\\Delta A = \\left(2\\pi a z_0 + \\pi a^2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right)\\right) - \\pi a^2 \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right)\\right)$$\n    $$\\Delta A = \\pi a^2 \\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a} + \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right) - 1 - \\cosh\\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a}\\right)\\right)$$\n    Using the identity $\\sinh(u) - \\cosh(u) = -e^{-u}$, with $u = \\frac{2z_0}{a}$:\n    $$\\Delta A = \\pi a^2 \\left(\\frac{2z_0}{a} - 1 - e^{-2z_0/a}\\right)$$\n\n4.  **Analysis of the sign of $\\Delta A$:**\n    The catenoid fails to be globally area-minimizing if $\\Delta A > 0$ for some $z_0 > 0$. Let $x = \\frac{2z_0}{a}$. Since $z_0 > 0$ and $a > 0$, we have $x > 0$. We need to analyze the sign of the function $g(x) = x - 1 - e^{-x}$.\n    The derivative is $g'(x) = 1 - (-e^{-x}) = 1 + e^{-x}$. For $x>0$, $e^{-x} > 0$, so $g'(x) > 1$. This means $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function for $x>0$.\n    Let's check the behavior of $g(x)$. As $x \\to 0^+$, $g(x) \\to 0 - 1 - 1 = -2$. For large $x$, $e^{-x} \\to 0$, so $g(x) \\approx x-1$, which goes to $+\\infty$.\n    Since $g(x)$ is continuous, starts from a negative value near $x=0$, and increases without bound, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there exists a unique value $x_c > 0$ such that $g(x_c) = 0$. For any $x > x_c$, we have $g(x) > 0$.\n    We can estimate $x_c$ by solving $x_c-1 = e^{-x_c}$. A numerical solution gives $x_c \\approx 1.278$.\n    This means if we choose $z_0$ such that $\\frac{2z_0}{a} > x_c$, then $\\Delta A > 0$. For example, if we choose $z_0=a$, then $x=\\frac{2a}{a}=2 > x_c$. For this choice, $\\Delta A = \\pi a^2 (2 - 1 - e^{-2}) = \\pi a^2(1 - e^{-2}) > 0$.\n    Therefore, for any $H \\ge a$, we can choose $z_0 = a \\in (0, H)$ and construct a competitor $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}_{H,a}$ with strictly smaller area. This proves that the catenoid is not always a global area minimizer.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For the neck region $|z|\\le z_0$ of the catenoid, the area difference between the removed catenoid segment and the two capping disks equals $\\pi a^2\\!\\left(2\\,\\tfrac{z_0}{a} - 1 - e^{-2 z_0/a}\\right)$, which is positive for some $z_0>0$. Therefore, for any $H \\ge z_0$ with such a choice of $z_0$, the competitor $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}_{H,z_0}$ has strictly smaller area than $\\Sigma_H$, and the catenoid is not globally area-minimizing for its boundary.**\n- The formula for the area difference $\\Delta A$ is correct, as derived above.\n- The claim that this difference is positive for some $z_0 > 0$ is correct, as shown by the analysis of $g(x)$.\n- The conclusion that for a sufficiently large catenoid (where $H$ is large enough to permit a choice of $z_0$ making $\\Delta A > 0$), the competitor surface has smaller area, thereby invalidating global minimality, is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For the neck region $|z|\\le z_0$ of the catenoid, the area difference between the removed catenoid segment and the two capping disks equals $\\pi a^2\\!\\left(1 + e^{-2 z_0/a} - 2\\,\\tfrac{z_0}{a}\\right)$, which is nonnegative for all $z_0>0$. Therefore, the catenoid neck always has area at most that of the two disks, and the catenoid is globally area-minimizing among all competitors.**\n- The formula for the area difference is the negative of the correct one. It is $-\\Delta A = A_{disks}(z_0) - A_{neck}(z_0)$.\n- The claim that this expression is nonnegative for all $z_0>0$ is equivalent to saying $\\Delta A \\le 0$ for all $z_0>0$. As we proved, $\\Delta A$ can be positive. Thus, this claim is false.\n- The conclusion that the catenoid is globally area-minimizing is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The cut-and-paste competitor $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}_{H,z_0}$ is inadmissible for area comparison because it is not smooth across the gluing circles and is disconnected; hence one cannot use it to invalidate global minimality of the catenoid.**\n- The surface $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}_{H,z_0}$ is indeed not smooth (it has a \"corner\" where the catenoid remnants meet the disks) and is disconnected (it consists of two separate components).\n- However, in the context of global area minimization, the class of admissible competitors is very broad. It typically includes any surface (in a suitable weak sense, like an integral current) with the same boundary. The competitor does not need to be smooth, connected, or itself a minimal surface. The argument is simply: if one can find *any* surface with the same boundary and smaller area, the original surface is not the global minimizer. The constructed competitor is a perfectly valid member of this comparison class. This type of argument is standard in the calculus of variations.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because the catenoid has zero mean curvature, every compact truncation $\\Sigma_H$ minimizes area among all surfaces with the same boundary $\\Gamma_H^+ \\cup \\Gamma_H^-$; therefore no cut-and-paste competitor can have smaller area than $\\Sigma_H$.**\n- A surface having zero mean curvature means it is a *minimal surface*. This is a local property, meaning the surface is a critical point of the area functional. It is locally area-minimizing (or unstable, like a saddle point).\n- This local property does not guarantee global area minimization. A function $f(x)$ can have $f'(x_0)=0$ at a local minimum $x_0$ without $x_0$ being a global minimum. Our analysis in point A explicitly constructs a competitor with smaller area for certain catenoids.\n- The statement makes the common error of conflating minimality (a local condition) with being area-minimizing (a global condition).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3048578"}]}
