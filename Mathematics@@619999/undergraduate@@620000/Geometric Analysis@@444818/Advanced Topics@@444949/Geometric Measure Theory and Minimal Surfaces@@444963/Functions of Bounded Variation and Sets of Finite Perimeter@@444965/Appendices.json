The function $H(x)$, the interval $[-1,1]$, and the definition of total variation are all standard concepts in real analysis. The problem is a direct application of a core definition to a fundamental example function. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains no ambiguities, contradictions, or missing information. The calculation is straightforward and leads to a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nTo compute the total variation $V_{-1}^{1}(H)$, we will use the given definition. Let $P = \\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ be an arbitrary partition of the interval $[-1, 1]$, such that $-1 = x_0  x_1  \\dots  x_n = 1$. The sum for this partition is given by\n$$ S(P) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})| $$\nThe function $H(x)$ is defined as\n$$ H(x) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{if } x \\in [-1, 0] \\\\ 1  \\text{if } x \\in (0, 1] \\end{cases} $$\nThe values of $H(x)$ are restricted to the set $\\{0, 1\\}$. Therefore, for any two points $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ in the partition, the term $|H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})|$ can only take one of the following values: $|0-0|=0$, $|1-1|=0$, $|1-0|=1$, or $|0-1|=1$. A term in the sum is non-zero if and only if its value is $1$, which occurs when $H(x_i) \\neq H(x_{i-1})$.\n\nThis inequality $H(x_i) \\neq H(x_{i-1})$ holds if and only if one of the points $x_{i-1}, x_i$ lies in the interval $[-1, 0]$ and the other lies in $(0, 1]$. Since the partition points are ordered ($x_{i-1}  x_i$), this condition is met precisely when $x_{i-1} \\le 0  x_i$.\n\nFor any partition $P$ of $[-1, 1]$, we will now show that there exists exactly one index $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ for which the condition $x_{k-1} \\le 0  x_k$ is satisfied.\nSince $x_0 = -1 \\le 0$ and $x_n = 1  0$, the set of indices $j$ such that $x_j  0$ is non-empty. Let $k$ be the smallest index in this set. Then $x_k  0$. By the minimality of $k$, the previous point in the partition, $x_{k-1}$, must satisfy $x_{k-1} \\le 0$. Thus, for this index $k$, we have $x_{k-1} \\le 0  x_k$. This proves the existence of such an index.\nTo prove uniqueness, assume there is another index $j$ such that $x_{j-1} \\le 0  x_j$.\nIf $j  k$, this contradicts the choice of $k$ as the minimal index for which $x_k  0$.\nIf $j  k$, then $j-1 \\ge k$. From the ordering of the partition, this implies $x_{j-1} \\ge x_k$. Since $x_k  0$, we have $x_{j-1}  0$. This contradicts the assumption that $x_{j-1} \\le 0$.\nTherefore, the index $k$ is unique for any given partition $P$.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the sum $S(P)$ for an arbitrary partition $P$.\nThe sum consists of terms $|H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})|$.\n- For all indices $i  k$, we have $x_i \\le x_{k-1} \\le 0$. Thus, both $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ are in $[-1, 0]$. This means $H(x_{i-1}) = 0$ and $H(x_i) = 0$. The corresponding term in the sum is $|0-0| = 0$.\n- For the index $i=k$, we have $x_{k-1} \\le 0$ and $x_k  0$. This implies $H(x_{k-1}) = 0$ and $H(x_k) = 1$. The term is $|H(x_k) - H(x_{k-1})| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\n- For all indices $i  k$, we have $x_{i-1} \\ge x_k  0$. Thus, both $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ are in $(0, 1]$. This means $H(x_{i-1}) = 1$ and $H(x_i) = 1$. The corresponding term is $|1-1| = 0$.\n\nSo, for any partition $P$ of $[-1, 1]$, the sum is\n$$ S(P) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |H(x_i) - H(x_{i-1})| = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 0\\right) + 1 + \\left(\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} 0\\right) = 1. $$\nThis shows that the sum of variations is exactly $1$ for *every* possible partition of the interval. The set of values of these sums is therefore the singleton set $\\{1\\}$.\n\nThe total variation $V_{-1}^{1}(H)$ is the supremum of this set of sums.\n$$ V_{-1}^{1}(H) = \\sup \\{ S(P) : P \\text{ is a partition of } [-1, 1] \\} = \\sup\\{1\\} = 1. $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3049112"}, {"introduction": "After capturing discontinuities, we now investigate how total variation behaves for continuous functions.

By the reverse triangle inequality, we know that $||y| - |z|| \\le |y-z|$ for any real numbers $y$ and $z$. Applying this to each term in the sum:\n$$\n||x_i| - |x_{i-1}|| \\le |x_i - x_{i-1}|\n$$\nSumming over all subintervals of the partition:\n$$\nS(P, f_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} ||x_i| - |x_{i-1}|| \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |x_i - x_{i-1}|\n$$\nThe sum on the right is the variation sum for the function $f_2(x) = x$, which we have already shown to be equal to $2$ for any partition. Therefore, for any partition $P$, we have $S(P, f_1) \\le 2$. This means that $2$ is an upper bound for the set of all possible sums for $f_1$. The supremum of this set must be less than or equal to this upper bound:\n$$\nV_{-1}^{1}(f_1) \\le 2\n$$\nTo show that the supremum is in fact equal to $2$, we must demonstrate that $2$ is the least upper bound.

Since $\\mathcal{L}^1(E)=0$ but $|Du|(E)=2 \\neq 0$, the measure $Du$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\nTherefore, by the Radon-Nikodym theorem, there is no function $g \\in L^1(\\Omega)$ that can represent the distribution $Du$. The derivative $Du$ is a purely singular measure.\nSince $Du$ is not in $L^1(\\Omega)$, the function $u$ is not in $W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$.\n\nThe explicit measure expression for $Du$ has been computed as $Du = \\delta_0 - \\delta_1$.
