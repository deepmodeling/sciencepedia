It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and definitions to proceed with a rigorous solution. We will address the three tasks in the order presented.\n\n### Task 1: Justification of Area Minimization via Calibration\n\nLet $S$ be a smooth, oriented $k$-dimensional surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with boundary $\\partial S = \\Gamma$. Suppose there exists a calibration for $S$, which is a smooth, closed $k$-form $\\omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ satisfying:\n1.  $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$ (closed form).\n2.  $\\|\\omega\\|_{\\ast} \\leq 1$ (comass condition).\n3.  $\\omega$ restricted to the tangent space of $S$ is the volume form of $S$. That is, for any $p \\in S$, $\\omega|_{T_p S} = \\mathrm{vol}_S$.\n\nThe area of $S$, denoted by $\\mathcal{A}(S)$, is given by the integral of its volume form:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(S) = \\int_{S} \\mathrm{vol}_S $$\nFrom condition $3$, we can substitute $\\omega$ for the volume form in the integral over $S$:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(S) = \\int_{S} \\omega $$\nFrom condition $1$, $\\omega$ is a closed form. Since $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a contractible space, the Poincaré lemma states that every closed form is also exact. Thus, there must exist a smooth $(k-1)$-form $\\alpha$ such that $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha$. Substituting this into the expression for the area of $S$ and applying Stokes's theorem, we get:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(S) = \\int_{S} \\mathrm{d}\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial S} \\alpha = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\alpha $$\nThis shows that the area of the calibrated surface $S$ can be calculated by integrating a potential form $\\alpha$ over its boundary $\\Gamma$.\n\nNow, let $\\Sigma$ be any other smooth, oriented $k$-dimensional surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that has the same boundary as $S$, i.e., $\\partial \\Sigma = \\Gamma$. The area of $\\Sigma$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(\\Sigma) = \\int_{\\Sigma} \\mathrm{vol}_{\\Sigma} $$\nCondition $2$, the comass condition $\\|\\omega\\|_{\\ast} \\leq 1$, states that for any unit simple $k$-vector $\\xi$ representing an oriented piece of a $k$-dimensional plane, the value $\\omega(\\xi)$ is at most $1$. The volume form $\\mathrm{vol}_{\\Sigma}$ on the tangent space $T_p\\Sigma$ at a point $p \\in \\Sigma$ is, by definition, evaluated on an oriented orthonormal basis, which corresponds to a unit simple $k$-vector. Therefore, the comass condition implies that at every point $p \\in \\Sigma$:\n$$ \\omega|_{T_p \\Sigma} \\leq \\mathrm{vol}_{\\Sigma} $$\nIntegrating this inequality over the entire surface $\\Sigma$ yields:\n$$ \\int_{\\Sigma} \\omega \\leq \\int_{\\Sigma} \\mathrm{vol}_{\\Sigma} = \\mathcal{A}(\\Sigma) $$\nAgain, we use the fact that $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha$ and apply Stokes's theorem to the integral on the left:\n$$ \\int_{\\Sigma} \\omega = \\int_{\\Sigma} \\mathrm{d}\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} \\alpha = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\alpha $$\nCombining our results, we have:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(S) = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\alpha \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_{\\Gamma} \\alpha \\leq \\mathcal{A}(\\Sigma) $$\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(S) \\leq \\mathcal{A}(\\Sigma) $$\nThis holds for any competitor surface $\\Sigma$ with the same boundary, proving that the existence of a calibration for $S$ implies $S$ is area-minimizing in its homology class.\n\n### Task 2: Construction of a Calibration for the Planar Disk\n\nThe candidate surface is the planar disk of radius $r$, $D_{r} = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : x^{2}+y^{2} \\leq r^{2}, z=0\\}$. The boundary is the circle $\\Gamma = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : x^{2}+y^{2} = r^{2}, z=0\\}$. The dimension of the surface is $k=2$. We orient $D_r$ with the upward-pointing normal vector $\\vec{n}=(0,0,1)$, which corresponds to the volume form $\\mathrm{d}A = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$.\n\nWe propose the following $2$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ as a candidate for the calibration:\n$$ \\omega = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y $$\nLet us verify that $\\omega$ satisfies the three conditions for a calibration.\n\n1.  **Closed form:** We must check if $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x)) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}y)) $$\n    Since the exterior derivative of an exact form is zero (i.e., $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}f) = 0$ for any function $f$), we have $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x)=0$ and $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}y)=0$. Thus, $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$. The form is closed.\n\n2.  **Comass condition:** We must check if $\\|\\omega\\|_{\\ast} \\leq 1$. A general $2$-form in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be written as $\\phi = P \\, \\mathrm{d}y \\wedge \\mathrm{d}z + Q \\, \\mathrm{d}z \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x + R \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$. The comass of $\\phi$ is given by the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector field $(P, Q, R)$, i.e., $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\ast} = \\sqrt{P^{2}+Q^{2}+R^{2}}$. For our form $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$, we have $P=0$, $Q=0$, and $R=1$. Therefore, its comass is:\n    $$ \\|\\omega\\|_{\\ast} = \\sqrt{0^{2} + 0^{2} + 1^{2}} = 1 $$\n    Since $\\|\\omega\\|_{\\ast}=1$, the condition $\\|\\omega\\|_{\\ast} \\leq 1$ is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Agreement with volume form:** We must check if $\\omega$ restricted to the tangent spaces of $D_r$ equals its volume form. At any point $p \\in D_r$, the disk lies in the $z=0$ plane, so its tangent space $T_p D_r$ is the $xy$-plane itself. The chosen orientation corresponds to the area element $\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$. Our form $\\omega$ is precisely $\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$, so it agrees with the volume form on $D_r$ by construction.\n\nAll three conditions are satisfied. Hence, $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$ is a valid calibration for the disk $D_r$.\n\n### Task 3: Determination of the Minimal Area\n\nFrom Task 1 and Task 2, we have established that the planar disk $D_r$ is an area-minimizing surface for the boundary $\\Gamma$ because we found a calibration for it. The minimal area is therefore simply the area of the disk $D_r$.\n\nWe can compute this area by integrating its volume form $\\mathrm{d}A = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$ over the domain $D_r$:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(D_r) = \\int_{D_r} \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y $$\nThis integral is most easily computed using polar coordinates. Let $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$ and $y = \\rho\\sin\\theta$. The domain of integration is $0 \\leq \\rho \\leq r$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. The area element becomes $\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y = \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}\\rho \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\theta$.\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(D_r) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{r} \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}\\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{\\rho^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{r} \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{r^{2}}{2} \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\frac{r^{2}}{2} [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{r^{2}}{2}(2\\pi) = \\pi r^{2} $$\nAlternatively, we can use the formulation from Task 1, where $\\mathcal{A}(D_r) = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\alpha$ with $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha$. For $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$, a suitable $1$-form is $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}(x \\, \\mathrm{d}y - y \\, \\mathrm{d}x)$. We parametrize the boundary circle $\\Gamma$ by $\\vec{\\gamma}(\\theta) = (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta, 0)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Then $x=r\\cos\\theta$, $y=r\\sin\\theta$, $\\mathrm{d}x=-r\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta$, and $\\mathrm{d}y=r\\cos\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta$. The pullback of $\\alpha$ to $\\Gamma$ is:\n$$ \\alpha|_{\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{2}((r\\cos\\theta)(r\\cos\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta) - (r\\sin\\theta)(-r\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta)) = \\frac{1}{2}r^{2}(\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta)\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\\mathrm{d}\\theta $$\nIntegrating over $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}(D_r) = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\alpha = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\pi r^{2} $$\nBoth methods confirm that the minimal area of a surface spanning the circle $\\Gamma$ is the area of the disk, $\\pi r^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi r^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3073974"}, {"introduction": "Many surfaces, including minimal ones, can be locally described as the graph of a function $z = u(x,y)$.

It asks for an assessment of several mathematical statements against known theorems, a standard format for a conceptual question in advanced mathematics.\n-   **Objective:** The language is precise, technical, and free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a correct and well-formulated question about established mathematical theory. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem concerns the existence of area-minimizing surfaces spanning a given boundary curve $\\Gamma$. The key distinction is between the classical setting of parametrized disks and the GMT setting of integral currents. The rectifiability of $\\Gamma$ is a central theme.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThis statement asserts that for a rectifiable Jordan curve $\\Gamma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, a classical solution exists which is a continuous, area-minimizing, harmonic, and conformal map.\nThis is a precise statement of the celebrated **Douglas-Radó theorem** (proven independently by Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó around $1930-1931$). The core of their proof involves the following steps:\n$1$. The area functional $\\mathcal{A}(u)$ is difficult to work with directly. Instead, one considers the Dirichlet energy functional $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_D |\\nabla u|^2 \\,dx\\,dy$.\n$2$. For any map $u$, it holds that $\\mathcal{A}(u) \\le E(u)$, with equality if and only if $u$ is conformal (i.e., $|u_x|^2 - |u_y|^2 = 0$ and $u_x \\cdot u_y = 0$).\n$3$. The condition that $\\Gamma$ is rectifiable ($\\mathcal{H}^1(\\Gamma) < \\infty$) guarantees that the infimum of the Dirichlet energy (and thus the area) over the class of admissible maps is finite. This allows for the use of the direct method of the calculus of variations.\n$4$. The direct method is applied to the Dirichlet energy $E(u)$. One takes a minimizing sequence of maps and, using the compactness properties of Sobolev spaces and the lower semicontinuity of the energy functional, proves the existence of an energy-minimizing map $u$.\n$5$. A minimizer of the Dirichlet energy is necessarily a harmonic map, meaning $\\Delta u = 0$.\n$6$. A fundamental result, sometimes called the \"Douglas-Radó Lemma\", states that a harmonic map that minimizes Dirichlet energy among all maps with the same boundary values is automatically conformal.\n$7$. Since the minimizer $u$ is conformal, its area equals its energy, $E(u) = \\mathcal{A}(u)$. It can then be shown that this energy-minimizer is also an area-minimizer.\n$8$. Further analysis shows that this solution $u$ is continuous on the closed disk $\\overline{D}$ and provides a weakly monotone parametrization of $\\Gamma$.\nTherefore, the statement is a correct summary of the classical existence theorem for the Plateau problem.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis statement addresses the existence of a solution in the Geometric Measure Theory (GMT) framework. It claims that if $\\Gamma$ is a rectifiable closed curve, it defines an integral $1$-current of finite mass, and there exists an area-minimizing integral $2$-current $T$ with boundary $\\partial T = \\Gamma$.\nThis is the main existence result for the Plateau problem in GMT, established by Herbert Federer and Wendell Fleming. The key theoretical tool is the **Compactness Theorem for Integral Currents**.\n$1$. A rectifiable closed curve $\\Gamma$ with finite length $\\mathcal{H}^1(\\Gamma)$ can indeed be represented as an integral $1$-current (which we also denote $\\Gamma$) of finite mass $M(\\Gamma) = \\mathcal{H}^1(\\Gamma)$. Because the curve is closed, its boundary as a current is zero, $\\partial\\Gamma = 0$. The problem is to find a $2$-current $T$ such that $\\partial T = \\Gamma$.\n$2$. The class of integral $2$-currents $T$ with $\\partial T = \\Gamma$ is non-empty, a necessary condition for the direct method. For example, the cone over $\\Gamma$ from a point defines such a current, and its mass is finite if $M(\\Gamma)$ is finite.\n$3$. Let $m = \\inf \\{ M(T) \\mid \\partial T = \\Gamma \\}$. Let $\\{T_j\\}$ be a minimizing sequence, i.e., $\\partial T_j = \\Gamma$ and $M(T_j) \\to m$.\n$4$. The masses $M(T_j)$ are bounded, and the masses of the boundaries $M(\\partial T_j) = M(\\Gamma)$ are also bounded (in fact, constant and finite).\n$5$. The Compactness Theorem for Integral Currents states that under these conditions, there exists a subsequence (relabeled as $\\{T_j\\}$) that converges weakly to an integral $2$-current $T$.\n$6$. The boundary operator $\\partial$ is continuous with respect to this weak convergence, so $\\partial T = \\lim_{j\\to\\infty} \\partial T_j = \\Gamma$.\n$7$. The mass functional $M$ is lower semicontinuous with respect to weak convergence, meaning $M(T) \\le \\liminf_{j\\to\\infty} M(T_j)$.\n$8$. Combining these facts, we have $M(T) \\le \\liminf_{j\\to\\infty} M(T_j) = m$. Since $T$ is in the admissible class (its boundary is $\\Gamma$), we must have $M(T) \\ge m$. Thus, $M(T) = m$.\nThis proves that $T$ is an area-minimizing integral $2$-current with the prescribed boundary $\\Gamma$. The statement is a correct description of this fundamental GMT result.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis statement claims that for nonrectifiable Jordan curves ($\\mathcal{H}^1(\\Gamma) = \\infty$), a classical area-minimizing parametrized disk may not exist because the class of admissible maps with finite area can be empty.\nThis is a direct consequence of the relationship between the energy of a map and the length of its boundary trace.\n$1$. As noted in the analysis of option A, the existence of a classical solution (a map $u \\in H^1(D, \\mathbb{R}^3)$) requires the infimum of the area/energy to be finite.\n$2$. A key inequality relates the $H^{1/2}$-norm of the boundary trace $u|_{\\partial D}$ to the $H^1$-norm of the map $u$. Specifically, finite Dirichlet energy $E(u) < \\infty$ implies that the trace $u|_{\\partial D}$ is in the Sobolev space $H^{1/2}(\\partial D, \\mathbb{R}^3)$.\n$3$. A function in $H^{1/2}(\\partial D, \\mathbb{R}^3)$ parametrizes a rectifiable curve. That is, if $u|_{\\partial D} \\in H^{1/2}$, then the curve it defines has finite length.\n$4$. Conversely, if a curve $\\Gamma$ is nonrectifiable, its length $\\mathcal{H}^1(\\Gamma)$ is infinite. By the contrapositive of the previous point, any continuous map $u: \\overline{D} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ with $u(\\partial D) = \\Gamma$ must have infinite Dirichlet energy, $E(u) = \\infty$.\n$5$. Since for any map, $\\mathcal{A}(u) \\le E(u)$, it is strongly suggested that the area must also be infinite. More directly, the infimum of the area over all continuous maps spanning a nonrectifiable curve is infinite.\n$6$. Therefore, if $\\Gamma$ is nonrectifiable, the class of admissible maps with finite area is empty. The Plateau problem, when posed as finding a minimizer of finite area, has no solution. An example of such a curve is the von Koch snowflake curve embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nThe statement is therefore a correct description of why the classical formulation fails for nonrectifiable boundaries.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis statement claims that rectifiability is not necessary for the classical formulation and that a solution exists for any compact Jordan curve $\\Gamma$.\nThis directly contradicts the analysis for options A and C. As established in C, if $\\Gamma$ is a nonrectifiable Jordan curve, the infimum of the area functional is infinite, and no finite-area solution exists. The classical theory of Douglas and Radó critically depends on the finiteness of the area infimum, which in turn necessitates the rectifiability of the boundary curve $\\Gamma$. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\nThis statement claims that in the GMT formulation, any compact set $\\Gamma$ of Hausdorff dimension $1$, even if purely unrectifiable, can be the boundary of an area-minimizing integral $2$-current.\nThis statement is incorrect due to the strict definitions within the theory of integral currents.\n$1$. The boundary operator $\\partial$ in the theory of integral currents maps the space of integral $k$-currents to the space of integral $(k-1)$-currents.\n$2$. Therefore, if $T$ is an integral $2$-current, its boundary $\\partial T$ must be an integral $1$-current.\n$3$. A fundamental property of an integral $k$-current is that its support is a $k$-rectifiable set. A set is $k$-rectifiable if it can be covered, up to a set of $\\mathcal{H}^k$-measure zero, by a countable union of images of Lipschitz maps from $\\mathbb{R}^k$. For $k=1$, this means the set has a well-defined tangent line $\\mathcal{H}^1$-almost everywhere.\n$4$. A purely unrectifiable set is, by definition, a set with positive $\\mathcal{H}^1$-measure that has an approximate tangent line at no point (or on a set of $\\mathcal{H}^1$-measure zero).\n$5$. Consequently, a purely unrectifiable set cannot be the support of a non-zero integral $1$-current.\nThus, a purely unrectifiable set cannot be the boundary $\\partial T$ of an integral $2$-current $T$. The framework of integral currents is not applicable to such boundaries. While more general theories (e.g., flat chains) can handle more general boundaries, the statement refers to integral currents, for which it is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3073967"}]}
