The calculation proceeds in two steps as requested by the problem.\n\nFirst, we determine the components $h_{ij}$ of the second fundamental form $h$ in the special orthonormal frame provided. Let $p \\in M$ be a point on the hypersurface. We are given a local orthonormal frame $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ for the tangent space $T_p M$ that consists of eigenvectors of the shape operator $A$. The corresponding eigenvalues are the principal curvatures $\\kappa_1, \\dots, \\kappa_n$. By reordering the basis vectors if necessary, we can set the eigenvalue equation for each basis vector as:\n$$\nA e_i = \\kappa_i e_i \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, n\n$$\nThe components $h_{ij}$ of the second fundamental form in this basis are defined by $h_{ij} = h(e_i, e_j)$. The problem provides the relation between the second fundamental form $h$ and the shape operator $A$:\n$$\nh(X, Y) = \\langle A X, Y \\rangle\n$$\nfor any tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p M$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the induced metric on $M$, which is the restriction of the Euclidean inner product of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nApplying this definition to our basis vectors, we get:\n$$\nh_{ij} = h(e_i, e_j) = \\langle A e_i, e_j \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the eigenvector relationship $A e_i = \\kappa_i e_i$ into this equation gives:\n$$\nh_{ij} = \\langle \\kappa_i e_i, e_j \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product in the first argument, we can factor out the scalar $\\kappa_i$:\n$$\nh_{ij} = \\kappa_i \\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle\n$$\nThe frame $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ is orthonormal. By definition, this means that the inner product of any two basis vectors is given by the Kronecker delta:\n$$\n\\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij} = 1$ if $i=j$ and $\\delta_{ij} = 0$ if $i \\neq j$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for $h_{ij}$, we find the components of the second fundamental form in the basis of principal directions:\n$$\nh_{ij} = \\kappa_i \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the matrix representation of the second fundamental form in this basis is a diagonal matrix with the principal curvatures on the diagonal. Specifically, $h_{ii} = \\kappa_i$ and $h_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nSecond, we compute the squared norm $|A|^2$. The problem defines this quantity as:\n$$\n|A|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} h_{ij} h_{ij}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (h_{ij})^2$.

Therefore, all terms in this sum are zero except for the one where $j=i$. For this term, $\\delta_{ii}=1$. The sum thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\kappa_i \\delta_{ij})^2 = (\\kappa_i \\delta_{ii})^2 = (\\kappa_i \\cdot 1)^2 = \\kappa_i^2\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $|A|^2$, which involves summing over the index $i$:\n$$\n|A|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\kappa_i^2\n$$\nThis result expresses the squared Hilbert–Schmidt norm of the shape operator as the sum of the squares of the principal curvatures.

The problem asks for the derivation of a standard formula in the differential geometry of hypersurfaces, using well-defined terms and established principles. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information. The context is correctly placed within geometric analysis, as the result is a precursor to an analysis using tools like Simons' equation. The problem is therefore deemed valid and we proceed with the solution.\n\nOur starting point is the Gauss equation for a smooth, oriented hypersurface $M^{n}$ isometrically immersed in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Since the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is flat, its Riemann curvature tensor is zero. The Gauss equation relates the intrinsic Riemann curvature tensor of $M^n$, with components $R_{ijkl}$, to its extrinsic curvature, captured by the second fundamental form $h$. The equation is:\n$$ R_{ijkl} = h_{ik}h_{jl} - h_{il}h_{jk} $$\nHere, $R_{ijkl} = g(R(e_k, e_l)e_j, e_i)$ where $e_i$ are basis vectors, and $h_{ij}$ are the components of the second fundamental form. To simplify the calculation of contractions, we may evaluate the expression in a local orthonormal frame at a point $p \\in M^n$, where the metric components are given by the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. Since the final result is a tensor equation, its validity is independent of the choice of frame.\n\nThe Ricci curvature tensor, with components $R_{jl}$, is obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor on its first and third indices:\n$$ R_{jl} = g^{ik} R_{ikjl} $$\nIn our orthonormal frame, $g^{ik} = \\delta^{ik}$, so the contraction becomes a summation:\n$$ R_{jl} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{ijil} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (h_{ii}h_{jl} - h_{il}h_{ji}) $$\nUsing the fact that the second fundamental form is a symmetric tensor, $h_{ji} = h_{ij}$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ R_{jl} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}\\right) h_{jl} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{il}h_{ij} $$\nWe now identify the terms in this expression.\nThe term $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}$ is the trace of the second fundamental form. In an orthonormal frame, the components of the shape operator $A$ are $A_{ij} = h_{ij}$. Thus, the mean curvature $H$, defined as the trace of the shape operator, $H = \\operatorname{tr}_{g}(A)$, is given by:\n$$ H = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} $$\nThe second term, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{il}h_{ij}$, represents the $(l,j)$-th component of the matrix product $h^2 = h \\cdot h$. So, for the component $R_{jl}$, we have:\n$$ R_{jl} = H h_{jl} - (h^2)_{jl} $$\nThe scalar curvature $R$ is obtained by taking the trace of the Ricci tensor, $R = g^{jl}R_{jl}$. In our orthonormal frame, this is another summation:\n$$ R = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} R_{jj} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left(H h_{jj} - (h^2)_{jj}\\right) $$\n$$ R = H \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} h_{jj}\\right) - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (h^2)_{jj} $$\nWe again identify $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} h_{jj} = H$. The second term is the trace of the matrix $h^2$, $\\operatorname{tr}(h^2) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (h^2)_{jj} = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}h_{ij} = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n (h_{ij})^2$. This sum of squares of the components of $h$ in an orthonormal basis is precisely the squared norm of the second fundamental form, denoted as $|A|^2$ in the problem statement. The general, coordinate-invariant definition is $|A|^2 = g^{ip}g^{jq}h_{ij}h_{pq}$, which reduces to $\\sum_{i,j} (h_{ij})^2$ in an orthonormal basis.\nSubstituting these into our expression for $R$, we arrive at the general relation between scalar curvature, mean curvature, and the norm of the second fundamental form:\n$$ R = H^2 - |A|^2 $$\nThis is the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we specialize to the case where $M^n$ is a minimal hypersurface. A hypersurface is defined to be minimal if its mean curvature is zero everywhere, i.e., $H=0$. Substituting $H=0$ into our derived formula gives the scalar curvature for a minimal hypersurface:\n$$ R = (0)^2 - |A|^2 = -|A|^2 $$\n\nFinally, we are asked to explain the sign of $R$ in this case. The term $|A|^2$ is the squared norm of the shape operator. In terms of the principal curvatures $\\kappa_1, \\dots, \\kappa_n$ (the eigenvalues of $A$), the squared norm is given by $|A|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\kappa_i^2$. As a sum of squares of real numbers, this quantity is always non-negative:\n$$ |A|^2 \\ge 0 $$\nTherefore, the scalar curvature of a minimal hypersurface in Euclidean space must be non-positive:\n$$ R = -|A|^2 \\le 0 $$\nThe equality $R=0$ occurs if and only if $|A|^2=0$, which implies that all principal curvatures are zero, $\\kappa_i=0$ for all $i=1,\\dots,n$. This means the shape operator $A$ is the zero tensor. A hypersurface with a vanishing shape operator is said to be totally geodesic. The only complete, totally geodesic hypersurfaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are the hyperplanes, which can be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nFor any minimal hypersurface that is not a hyperplane (e.g., a catenoid or a helicoid for $n=2$), the shape operator is non-zero, so $|A|^2  0$ and the scalar curvature $R$ is strictly negative. The condition of being minimal, $H = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\kappa_i = 0$, means that any positive principal curvatures must be balanced by negative ones. The scalar curvature formula $R = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\kappa_i^2$ reveals that this extrinsic balancing act to achieve zero mean curvature forces the intrinsic scalar curvature to be non-positive. The extrinsic \"bending\" of a minimal surface, as measured by $|A|^2$, dictates the negativity of its intrinsic scalar curvature.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-|A|^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3062536"}, {"introduction": "Theory comes to life when applied to concrete examples.
