For a function $g$ on a finite measure space and for any real numbers $p, q, r$ such that $1 \\leq p  q  r \\leq \\infty$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\n\\|g\\|_{L^{q}} \\leq \\|g\\|_{L^{p}}^{\\theta} \\|g\\|_{L^{r}}^{1-\\theta}\n$$\nwhere the interpolation exponent $\\theta \\in (0, 1)$ is determined by the relation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{\\theta}{p} + \\frac{1-\\theta}{r}\n$$\n\nTo prove this, we write $\\|g\\|_{L^q}^q = \\int |g|^q \\, dV = \\int |g|^{\\theta q} |g|^{(1-\\theta)q} \\, dV$. We apply Hölder's inequality with conjugate exponents $p_1$ and $p_2$ chosen such that $\\theta q p_1 = p$ and $(1-\\theta)q p_2 = r$. This implies $p_1 = p/(\\theta q)$ and $p_2 = r/((1-\\theta)q)$. These exponents are indeed conjugate as $\\frac{1}{p_1} + \\frac{1}{p_2} = \\frac{\\theta q}{p} + \\frac{(1-\\theta)q}{r} = q \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{p} + \\frac{1-\\theta}{r} \\right) = q \\left( \\frac{1}{q} \\right) = 1$.

Taking the $q$-th root yields the interpolation inequality.\n\nIn this problem, we want to relate the $L^2$ norm to the $L^1$ and $L^6$ norms. We therefore set $p=1$, $q=2$, and $r=6$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nA Nash-type inequality is a functional inequality that bounds a function's $L^2$-norm in terms of its gradient's $L^2$-norm and its $L^1$-norm. A typical form is:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^2(M)}^{2(1 + 2/n)} \\le C \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}^2 \\|u\\|_{L^1(M)}^{4/n} $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant depending on the manifold's geometry. For the purpose of this problem, any inequality that becomes trivial or contradictory for certain functions based on its dependence on $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$, $\\|u\\|_{L^2(M)}$, and $\\|u\\|_{L^1(M)}$ will suffice. The crucial feature is the presence of the $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$ term.\n\nLet us test such an inequality with a non-zero constant function $u(x) = c$ for $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $c \\neq 0$.\nFor such a function, we have:\n-   $\\nabla u = \\nabla c = 0$, so $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)} = 0$.\n-   $\\|u\\|_{L^2(M)} = \\left( \\int_M |c|^2 \\, d\\mu \\right)^{1/2} = |c| \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Vol}(M)}  0$.\n-   $\\|u\\|_{L^1(M)} = \\int_M |c| \\, d\\mu = |c| \\operatorname{Vol}(M)  0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the typical form of the Nash inequality gives:\n$$ \\left(|c| \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Vol}(M)}\\right)^{2(1 + 2/n)} \\le C \\cdot 0^2 \\cdot \\left(|c| \\operatorname{Vol}(M)\\right)^{4/n} $$\n$$ \\text{Positive value} \\le 0 $$\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, a standard Nash-type inequality cannot hold for all functions in a space that includes non-zero constants. This fundamental observation is key to evaluating the options.\n\n**Option A: Under Dirichlet boundary conditions, a Nash-type inequality can be formulated for all $u \\in H_0^1(M)$ without any mean-zero constraint, because nonzero constants are excluded from $H_0^1(M)$; this is consistent with the Poincaré inequality $\\|u\\|_{L^2(M)} \\le C_D \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$.**\n\nFunctions in $H_0^1(M)$ are limits of smooth functions with compact support in the interior of $M$. A key property of such functions is that their trace on the boundary $\\partial M$ is zero. If a constant function $u(x) = c$ belongs to $H_0^1(M)$, its trace on the boundary must be zero. Since $\\partial M$ is nonempty, this forces $c=0$. Thus, the only constant function in $H_0^1(M)$ is the zero function, $u=0$, for which the Nash inequality holds trivially ($0 \\le 0$). By excluding all non-zero constant functions, the space $H_0^1(M)$ automatically avoids the contradiction derived above. This is precisely why the standard Poincaré inequality for Dirichlet boundary conditions, $\\|u\\|_{L^2(M)} \\le C_D \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$, also holds on $H_0^1(M)$ without any further constraints. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B: Under Neumann boundary conditions, a Nash-type inequality that relates only $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$, $\\|u\\|_{L^2(M)}$, and $\\|u\\|_{L^1(M)}$ cannot hold uniformly for all $u \\in H^1(M)$ unless one imposes a normalization such as $\\int_M u \\, d\\mu = 0$; otherwise nonzero constants violate the inequality.**\n\nThe space $H^1(M)$ does not impose any boundary value conditions like Dirichlet's, so it contains all constant functions $u(x)=c$. As demonstrated in the initial analysis, any non-zero constant function $u=c \\neq 0$ will have $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)} = 0$ while its $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms are positive, leading to a contradiction in any standard Nash-type inequality. To remedy this, one must restrict the space of functions. The constraint $\\int_M u \\, d\\mu = 0$ (the mean-zero constraint) effectively removes all non-zero constant functions, since for $u=c$, $\\int_M c \\, d\\mu = c \\operatorname{Vol}(M)$, which is zero if and only if $c=0$. Therefore, this constraint is necessary for such an inequality to hold on a space related to $H^1(M)$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option C: If $\\operatorname{Vol}(M) = 1$, then in the Neumann case the mean-zero constraint is unnecessary because for constant functions $\\|u\\|_{L^1(M)} = \\|u\\|_{L^2(M)}$, so constants no longer contradict a Nash-type inequality.**\n\nLet's assume $\\operatorname{Vol}(M)=1$ and consider a constant function $u(x)=c \\neq 0$.\nThen $\\|u\\|_{L^1(M)} = \\int_M |c| \\, d\\mu = |c| \\operatorname{Vol}(M)=|c|$.\nAnd $\\|u\\|_{L^2(M)} = (\\int_M |c|^2 \\, d\\mu)^{1/2} = |c| \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Vol}(M)}=|c|$.\nSo, the premise $\\|u\\|_{L^1(M)} = \\|u\\|_{L^2(M)}$ is correct under these conditions.\nHowever, the contradiction in the Nash inequality stemmed from $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)} = 0$ while the other norms were positive. The equality between the $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms is irrelevant to this core issue. The inequality still yields $\\text{Positive value} \\le 0$. The mean-zero constraint is still necessary to exclude the problematic constant functions.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: With the Neumann mean-zero constraint, the optimal Nash constant is controlled by the first positive Neumann eigenvalue $\\lambda_1^N$ of $-\\Delta$, while in the Dirichlet case it is controlled by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\\lambda_1^D$; in particular, geometric bounds that control $\\lambda_1^N$ or $\\lambda_1^D$ yield corresponding control of Nash constants.**\n\nThis statement touches upon the deep connection between functional inequalities and the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The proofs of inequalities like Poincaré, Nash, and Log-Sobolev are often carried out using the heat semigroup $e^{t\\Delta}$. The long-time behavior of this semigroup is governed by the lowest non-zero eigenvalue of $-\\Delta$.\n-   For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the spectrum starts at $\\lambda_1^D  0$. The decay rate of solutions to the heat equation is $e^{-\\lambda_1^D t}$.\n-   For Neumann boundary conditions, the first eigenvalue is $\\lambda_0^N = 0$ (corresponding to constant eigenfunctions). The first positive eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1^N$, which governs the rate of decay towards the mean value.\nThe constant in the Nash inequality depends on both the short-time behavior of the heat kernel (which is local and dimension-dependent) and its long-time decay rate (which is global and depends on the spectral gap). Therefore, the Nash constant is quantitatively \"controlled by\" $\\lambda_1^D$ in the Dirichlet case and by $\\lambda_1^N$ in the Neumann case for mean-zero functions. Consequently, any geometric bounds on these eigenvalues (e.g., from Cheeger's inequality) translate directly into bounds on the Nash constant.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option E: An equivalent formulation of the Neumann-case Nash inequality avoids an explicit mean-zero restriction by replacing $u$ with $u - \\bar u$ in all norms, where $\\bar u = \\operatorname{Vol}(M)^{-1} \\int_M u \\, d\\mu$; this leaves $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$ unchanged and excludes constants implicitly.**\n\nLet $v = u - \\bar{u}$. By definition, $\\bar{u}$ is the mean of $u$, which is a constant.\n-   The gradient of $v$ is $\\nabla v = \\nabla(u - \\bar{u}) = \\nabla u - \\nabla(\\text{constant}) = \\nabla u$. Thus, $\\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2(M)} = \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$. The statement is correct on this point.\n-   The mean of $v$ is $\\int_M v \\, d\\mu = \\int_M (u - \\bar{u}) \\, d\\mu = \\int_M u \\, d\\mu - \\bar{u} \\int_M d\\mu = \\bar{u} \\operatorname{Vol}(M) - \\bar{u}\\operatorname{Vol}(M) = 0$. So, $v$ is always a mean-zero function.\nAn inequality valid for all mean-zero functions can be applied to $v = u-\\bar{u}$. This gives an inequality of the form $\\|u-\\bar{u}\\|_{L^2(M)} \\le \\dots$ which involves $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(M)}$ and $\\|u-\\bar{u}\\|_{L^1(M)}$. This new inequality is valid for *any* $u \\in H^1(M)$, not just mean-zero ones. If $u$ is a constant, $u=c$, then $\\bar{u}=c$, so $u-\\bar{u}=0$. The inequality becomes $0 \\le 0$, which is trivially true. This formulation thus \"excludes constants implicitly\" by making the inequality trivial for them. This is a standard procedure and is perfectly analogous to the formulation of the Neumann-Poincaré inequality given in the problem statement.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "3073290"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its elegant form, the Nash inequality has profound analytic consequences, most notably in describing the smoothing properties of the heat equation.

The heat kernel $p_{t}^{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(x,y)$ is given by the eigenfunction expansion:\n$$\np_{t}^{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(x,y) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} e^{\\lambda_k t} \\phi_{k}(x) \\overline{\\phi_{k}(y)} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|k|^{2}t) \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x-y \\rangle).\n$$\nOn the diagonal, where $x=y$, this simplifies to:\n$$\np_{t}^{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(x,x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|k|^{2}t).\n$$\nNotice this is independent of $x$, which is expected as $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ is a homogeneous space. To find the asymptotic behavior as $t \\to 0^{+}$, we apply the Poisson summation formula, which states that for a suitable function $f$, $\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} f(k) = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\hat{f}(m)$, where $\\hat{f}$ is the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} f(x) \\exp(-2\\pi i \\langle x, \\xi \\rangle) dx$.\nLet $f(v) = \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}t|v|^{2})$. This is a Gaussian function. The Fourier transform of a general Gaussian $g(v) = \\exp(-a|v|^{2})$ is $\\hat{g}(\\xi) = (\\frac{\\pi}{a})^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\exp(-\\frac{\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2}}{a})$. In our case, $a = 4\\pi^{2}t$. Thus,\n$$\n\\hat{f}(m) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4\\pi^{2}t}\\right)^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^{2}|m|^{2}}{4\\pi^{2}t}\\right) = (4\\pi t)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|m|^{2}}{4t}\\right).\n$$\nApplying the Poisson summation formula to $p_{t}^{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(x,x)$ gives:\n$$\np_{t}^{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(x,x) = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} (4\\pi t)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|m|^{2}}{4t}\\right) = (4\\pi t)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|m|^{2}}{4t}\\right).\n$$\nWe are interested in the limit $L_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(n) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}t^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\,p_{t}^{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(x,x)$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(n) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}} t^{\\frac{n}{2}} (4\\pi t)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|m|^{2}}{4t}\\right) = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}} \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|m|^{2}}{4t}\\right).\n$$\nAs $t \\to 0^{+}$, the term $1/(4t) \\to \\infty$. For any $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ with $m \\neq 0$, we have $|m|^{2} \\geq 1$, so $\\exp(-|m|^{2}/(4t)) \\to 0$. The only term that survives in the sum is for $m=0$, which is $\\exp(0)=1$. Thus, the limit of the sum is $1$.\n$$\nL_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(n) = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot 1 = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}}.\n$$\n\nSecond, we justify that the same limit holds for the unit sphere $S^{n}$. The small-time behavior of the heat kernel is a local property. For $t \\to 0^{+}$, heat propagation is confined to an infinitesimally small neighborhood of the starting point. In any such neighborhood, a smooth Riemannian manifold can be approximated by its tangent space, which is $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nMore formally, in normal coordinates centered at a point $p \\in S^{n}$, the metric tensor satisfies $g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} + O(|x|^{2})$ and the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ agrees with the Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta_{\\text{Euc}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x_i^2}$ to leading order. The heat equation $\\partial_{t}u = \\Delta u$ is therefore approximated by the standard Euclidean heat equation $\\partial_{t}u = \\Delta_{\\text{Euc}}u$. The fundamental solution (heat kernel) for the Euclidean heat equation in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is $K_t(x,y) = (4\\pi t)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\exp(-\\frac{|x-y|^2}{4t})$.\nThe leading term of the on-diagonal small-time asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel on any $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold is universal and matches the Euclidean kernel at $x=y$:\n$$\np_{t}(x,x) \\sim (4\\pi t)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\quad \\text{as } t \\to 0^{+}.\n$$\nThe sphere $S^{n}$ is a homogeneous space, meaning its isometry group acts transitively. This implies that the geometry is the same at every point, and consequently the on-diagonal heat kernel $p_{t}^{S^{n}}(x,x)$ must be independent of $x \\in S^{n}$. Therefore, the limit $L_{S^{n}}(n) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}t^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\,p_{t}^{S^{n}}(x,x)$ exists, is independent of $x$, and is given by this universal leading-order behavior.\n$$\nL_{S^{n}}(n) = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}}.\n$$\nThe explicit calculation for $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ serves as a concrete verification of this general principle on a manifold that is locally Euclidean everywhere.\n\nThird, we explain the connection to the Nash inequality, which states that for a smooth function $u$, $\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}^{1+\\frac{2}{n}}\\leq C_{N}\\,\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}}\\,\\|u\\|_{L^{1}}^{\\frac{2}{n}}$. This inequality implies a quantitative estimate on the smoothing properties of the heat semigroup $e^{t\\Delta}$.\nLet $u_t = e^{t\\Delta}f$ for some initial data $f$. The $L^{1}$-norm is conserved, $\\|u_t\\|_{L^1} = \\|f\\|_{L^1}$.\nConsider the evolution of the $L^2$-norm squared, $E(t) = \\|u_t\\|_{L^2}^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int u_t^2 dV = 2 \\int u_t (\\Delta u_t) dV = -2 \\int |\\nabla u_t|^2 dV = -2 \\|\\nabla u_t\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\nFrom the Nash inequality, we have $\\|\\nabla u_t\\|_{L^2}^2 \\ge C_N^{-2} \\|u_t\\|_{L^2}^{2(1+2/n)} \\|u_t\\|_{L^1}^{-4/n}$. Substituting this into the derivative gives a differential inequality for $E(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} \\le -2 C_N^{-2} E(t)^{1+2/n} \\|f\\|_{L^1}^{-4/n}.\n$$\nThis is of the form $y' \\le -K y^{1+\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha = 2/n$. Solving this implies a decay rate for $E(t)$, which leads to an $L^1 \\to L^2$ estimate for the semigroup: $\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^2} \\le C_1 t^{-n/4} \\|f\\|_{L^1}$.\nBy duality, the operator norm of $e^{t\\Delta}: L^2 \\to L^\\infty$ is the same as its norm from $L^1 \\to L^2$. Thus, $\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^\\infty} \\le C_1 t^{-n/4} \\|f\\|_{L^2}$.\nUsing the semigroup property $e^{t\\Delta} = e^{t/2\\Delta} \\circ e^{t/2\\Delta}$, we can compose these two estimates:\n$$\n\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^\\infty} = \\|e^{t/2\\Delta}(e^{t/2\\Delta}f)\\|_{L^\\infty} \\le C_1 (t/2)^{-n/4} \\|e^{t/2\\Delta}f\\|_{L^2} \\le C_1 (t/2)^{-n/4} \\cdot C_1 (t/2)^{-n/4} \\|f\\|_{L^1}.\n$$\nThis simplifies to $\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^\\infty} \\le C t^{-n/2} \\|f\\|_{L^1}$ for some constant $C$. This is the $L^1 \\to L^\\infty$ smoothing bound. The operator norm $\\|e^{t\\Delta}\\|_{L^1 \\to L^\\infty}$ is given by the supremum of its integral kernel, $\\sup_{x,y} p_t(x,y)$, which on a compact manifold equals $\\sup_x p_t(x,x)$.\nTherefore, the Nash inequality implies that $\\sup_x p_t(x,x) \\le C t^{-n/2}$. This is perfectly consistent with the asymptotic behavior $p_t(x,x) \\sim L(n)t^{-n/2}$ that we computed. The Nash inequality correctly predicts the sharp dimensional-dependent rate $t^{-n/2}$ of the short-time smoothing, while a direct calculation or local geometry argument is needed to find the precise coefficient $L(n)$.\n\nThe common closed-form value $L(n) = L_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(n)=L_{S^{n}}(n)$ is therefore:\n$$\nL(n) = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}}}$$", "id": "3073284"}]}
