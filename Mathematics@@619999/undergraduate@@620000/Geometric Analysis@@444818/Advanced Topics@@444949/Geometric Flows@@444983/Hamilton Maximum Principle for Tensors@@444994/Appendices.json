Let $T_{i_1\\dots i_r}$ be the components of the tensor $T$ in the given normal coordinates. The expression to compute is $\\partial_{t}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}(P, t_0) - (\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}(P, t_0)$.\n\nThe main part of the calculation is to find the expression for the rough Laplacian, $(\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} = g^{pq}(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}$.\n\nFirst, we write the formula for the first covariant derivative of a type $(0,r)$ tensor:\n$$(\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} = \\partial_{q}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} - \\sum_{s=1}^{r}\\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{s-1} k i_{s+1} \\dots i_{r}}$$\nHere, $\\partial_q$ denotes the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^q}$, and we use the standard convention for placing the substituted index $k$ in the $s$-th position.\n\nNext, we compute the second covariant derivative, which is the covariant derivative of the $(0,r+1)$-tensor $\\nabla T$:\n$$(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} = \\partial_{p}\\left((\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\right) - \\sum_{s=1}^{r}\\Gamma^\\ell_{p i_{s}}(\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots \\ell \\dots i_{r}} - \\Gamma^\\ell_{pq}(\\nabla_{\\ell}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}$$\nThe last term involving $\\Gamma^\\ell_{pq}$ comes from differentiating the lower index $q$ of the tensor $(\\nabla T)_{q i_1 \\dots i_r}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate all expressions at the point $P$ and time $t_0$. The key properties of the normal coordinates at $(P, t_0)$ are:\n1. $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ and hence $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$.\n2. $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i, j, k$.\n\nLet's simplify the terms at $(P, t_0)$.\nThe second and third terms in the expression for $(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}$ vanish at $P$ because they contain a factor of a Christoffel symbol, which is zero at $P$.\n$$(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = \\partial_{p}\\left((\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\right)\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $(\\nabla_q T)$:\n$$(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = \\partial_{p}\\left(\\partial_{q}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} - \\sum_{s=1}^{r}\\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}}T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}}\\right)\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\nUsing the product rule for derivatives:\n$$ = \\left(\\partial_{p}\\partial_{q}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} - \\sum_{s=1}^{r}\\left[ (\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}})T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}} + \\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}}(\\partial_{p}T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}}) \\right]\\right)\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\nAgain, at $P$, the term $\\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}}(\\partial_{p}T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}})$ vanishes because $\\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}}(P,t_0) = 0$. This leaves us with:\n$$(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = \\partial_{p}\\partial_{q}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} - \\sum_{s=1}^{r}\\left(\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}}\\right)\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\nNote that the derivatives of the Christoffel symbols, $\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^k_{q i_{s}}$, are not generally zero at $P$.\n\nNow we can compute the components of the rough Laplacian $\\Delta T$.\n$$(\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = g^{pq}(P,t_0) (\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\nUsing $g^{pq}(P,t_0) = \\delta^{pq}$, the expression becomes a contraction (trace) over indices $p$ and $q$. Using Einstein summation convention where a repeated upper and lower index implies summation from $1$ to $n$:\n$$(\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = \\delta^{pq}(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = (\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{p}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\nSubstituting the simplified expression for the second covariant derivative:\n$$(\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = \\partial_{p}\\partial_{p}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} - \\sum_{s=1}^{r}\\left(\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^k_{p i_{s}}\\right)\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\nIn this final expression for the Laplacian, summation over the repeated index $p$ (from $1$ to $n$) and the repeated index $k$ (from $1$ to $n$) is implied.\n\nFinally, we assemble the full expression for $(\\partial_t - \\Delta)T$:\n$$(\\partial_{t} - \\Delta)T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} = \\partial_{t}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)} - (\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}\\Big|_{(P,t_0)}$$\n$$= \\partial_{t}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} - \\left( \\partial_{p}\\partial_{p}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} - \\sum_{s=1}^{r}(\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^k_{p i_{s}})T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}} \\right)$$\n$$= \\partial_{t}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} - \\partial_{p}\\partial_{p}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} + \\sum_{s=1}^{r}(\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^k_{p i_{s}})T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}}$$\nwhere all terms are evaluated at $(P,t_0)$. The term $\\partial_{p}\\partial_{p}$ denotes the standard Laplacian on functions, $\\sum_{p=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial (x^p)^2}$.\n\n### Explanation for Maximum Principle Arguments\n\nThe second part of the question asks why choosing normal coordinates eliminates first-order spatial derivative terms.\n\nIn a general coordinate system, the expansion of the rough Laplacian $(\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} = g^{pq}(\\nabla_{p}\\nabla_{q}T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}$ contains terms of second, first, and zeroth order in the spatial derivatives of the tensor components $T_{i_1\\dots i_r}$. The first-order derivative terms arise from the Christoffel symbols acting on first derivatives of $T$. Specifically, expanding $\\nabla_p \\nabla_q T$ fully yields terms of the schematic form:\n$$\\nabla\\nabla T \\sim \\partial\\partial T + (\\partial\\Gamma)T + \\Gamma(\\partial T) + \\Gamma\\Gamma T$$\nThe terms of the form $\\Gamma(\\partial T)$, such as $g^{pq}\\Gamma^k_{pi_s}\\partial_q T_{\\dots}$, are the first-order spatial derivative terms.\n\nThe crucial simplification comes from evaluating the expression at a point $P$ using a normal coordinate system centered at $P$. By definition of such a system, the Christoffel symbols themselves vanish at $P$: $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(P,t_0) = 0$.\n\nConsequently, at the point $P$, every term in the expansion of $(\\Delta T)_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}$ that contains an undifferentiated Christoffel symbol as a factor becomes zero. This is precisely what happens to all first-order spatial derivative terms of the form $\\Gamma(\\partial T)$.\n\nThe terms that survive are:\n1.  **Second-order derivative terms:** $\\partial_{p}\\partial_{p}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}$, which arise from the highest derivative part $\\partial\\partial T$. In normal coordinates at $P$, this simplifies to the flat Laplacian on the components of $T$.\n2.  **Zeroth-order derivative terms:** $\\sum_{s=1}^{r}(\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^k_{p i_{s}})T_{i_{1}\\dots k \\dots i_{r}}$. These terms arise from differentiating the Christoffel symbols (the $(\\partial\\Gamma)T$ part), which do not vanish in general. These terms depend linearly on the components of $T$ itself, not its derivatives, and the coefficients involve curvature information (since derivatives of $\\Gamma$ are related to the Riemann curvature tensor).\n\nThis simplification is fundamental to the application of the maximum principle to evolution equations for tensors (like the Ricci flow, which is an evolution equation for the metric tensor). At a maximum or minimum point of a function of the tensor (e.g., its norm), the gradient of the function vanishes. The parabolic evolution equation simplifies, at that point, to an expression involving only second derivatives (which have a definite sign at a maximum/minimum) and zeroth-order terms, allowing for a direct comparison that yields a contradiction or inequality. The absence of first-order derivative terms is essential for this argument to work cleanly.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\partial_{t}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} - \\partial_{p}\\partial_{p}T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}} + \\sum_{s=1}^{r}\\left(\\partial_{p}\\Gamma^{k}_{p i_{s}}\\right)T_{i_{1}\\dots i_{s-1} k i_{s+1} \\dots i_{r}}\n}\n$$", "id": "3051279"}, {"introduction": "Beyond controlling a tensor's overall size, we often need to control its qualitative properties, which are encoded in its eigenvalues.

First, the first derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla_l (h_{ij} v^i v^j) = (\\nabla_l h_{ij}) v^i v^j + h_{ij} (\\nabla_l v^i) v^j + h_{ij} v^i (\\nabla_l v^j) = (\\nabla_l h_{ij}) v^i v^j + 2 h_{ij} v^i (\\nabla_l v^j)\n$$\nNext, we take another covariant derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla_k \\nabla_l (h_{ij} v^i v^j) = \\nabla_k ( (\\nabla_l h_{ij}) v^i v^j + 2 h_{ij} v^i (\\nabla_l v^j) )\n$$\nApplying the Leibniz rule again yields:\n$$\n= (\\nabla_k \\nabla_l h_{ij}) v^i v^j + (\\nabla_l h_{ij})(\\nabla_k v^i)v^j + (\\nabla_l h_{ij})v^i(\\nabla_k v^j) + 2(\\nabla_k h_{ij})v^i(\\nabla_l v^j) + 2h_{ij}(\\nabla_k v^i)(\\nabla_l v^j) + 2h_{ij}v^i(\\nabla_k \\nabla_l v^j)\n$$\nNow we evaluate this expression at the point $(x_0, t_0)$. The problem states that at this point, $\\nabla v = 0$, which means the components $\\nabla_k v^i$ are all zero. Consequently, every term containing a single factor of a first covariant derivative of $v$ vanishes:\n$$\n\\nabla_k \\nabla_l (h_{ij} v^i v^j)|_{(x_0,t_0)} = (\\nabla_k \\nabla_l h_{ij}) v^i v^j + 2 h_{ij} v^i (\\nabla_k \\nabla_l v^j)\n$$\nTo compute $\\Delta \\Phi$, we contract with the inverse metric $g^{kl}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Phi|_{(x_0,t_0)} = g^{kl} (\\nabla_k \\nabla_l h_{ij}) v^i v^j + 2 g^{kl} h_{ij} v^i (\\nabla_k \\nabla_l v^j)\n$$\nThe first term is, by definition, $(\\Delta h_{ij}) v^i v^j$. The second term can be written as $2 h_{ij} v^i (g^{kl} \\nabla_k \\nabla_l v^j) = 2 h_{ij} v^i (\\Delta v^j)$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\Phi|_{(x_0,t_0)} = (\\Delta h_{ij}) v^i v^j + 2 h_{ij} v^i (\\Delta v^j)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that at $(x_0, t_0)$, we also have $\\Delta v = 0$, which means its components $\\Delta v^j$ are zero. Thus, the second term vanishes:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Phi|_{(x_0,t_0)} = (\\Delta h_{ij}) v^i v^j\n$$\n\n**2.3. Final Calculation**\n\nWe now assemble the expression for $(\\partial_t - \\Delta)\\Phi$ at $(x_0, t_0)$ using our results from the previous sections:\n$$\n(\\partial_t - \\Delta)\\Phi|_{(x_0,t_0)} = (\\partial_t\\Phi)|_{(x_0,t_0)} - (\\Delta\\Phi)|_{(x_0,t_0)}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\n(\\partial_t - \\Delta)\\Phi|_{(x_0,t_0)} = [(\\Delta h_{ij}) v^i v^j + \\mathcal{N}_{ij}(h) v^i v^j] - [(\\Delta h_{ij}) v^i v^j]\n$$\nThe term $(\\Delta h_{ij}) v^i v^j$ cancels out:\n$$\n(\\partial_t - \\Delta)\\Phi|_{(x_0,t_0)} = \\mathcal{N}_{ij}(h) v^i v^j\n$$\nThe entire expression for $(\\partial_t - \\Delta)\\Phi$ at the point $(x_0, t_0)$ reduces to the scalar quantity formed by contracting the reaction tensor $\\mathcal{N}(h)$ with the rank-one tensor $v \\otimes v$. This is the result of all other terms either vanishing due to the special properties of the vector field $v$ at $(x_0, t_0)$ or cancelling out.\n\nThe scalar contribution $F$ of the reaction term $\\mathcal{N}(h)$ to the scalar quantity $(\\partial_t-\\Delta)\\Phi$ is therefore the entirety of this final expression.\n$$\nF = \\mathcal{N}_{ij}(h) v^i v^j\n$$\nAll quantities are evaluated at the point $(x_0, t_0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\mathcal{N}_{ij}(h) v^i v^j}\n$$", "id": "3051321"}]}
