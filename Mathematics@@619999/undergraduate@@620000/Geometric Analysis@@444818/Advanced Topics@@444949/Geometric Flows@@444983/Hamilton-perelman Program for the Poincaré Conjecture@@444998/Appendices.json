Give an accurate definition of a simply connected $3$-manifold.\n    2. Provide one valid example of a simply connected $3$-manifold.\n    3.

The concepts of $3$-manifolds, simple connectivity, contractibility, the fundamental group, and the Poincaré conjecture are all standard, rigorous, and central to modern mathematics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

The analysis will proceed to a full solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nBefore evaluating the options, we establish the correct definitions and key concepts as per the principles of algebraic topology.\n\n1.  **Simply Connected Space:** A topological space $X$ is **simply connected** if it is path-connected and its fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the trivial group for some (and hence any) base point $x_0 \\in X$. The triviality of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X) = \\{e\\}$, means that every loop (a continuous map from the circle $S^1$ into $X$) can be continuously shrunk to a point within $X$. The $n$-sphere, $S^n$, is simply connected for all $n \\ge 2$. In the context of the problem, the $3$-sphere, $S^3$, is the quintessential example of a simply connected $3$-manifold that is not contractible.\n\n2.  **Contractible Space:** A topological space $X$ is **contractible** if it is homotopy equivalent to a point. This is equivalent to stating that the identity map $\\operatorname{id}_X: X \\to X$ is homotopic to a constant map $c_p: X \\to \\{p\\}$ for some point $p \\in X$. A space being contractible implies that all of its homotopy groups $\\pi_n(X)$ are trivial for all $n \\ge 0$. By the Hurewicz theorem, this also implies that all of its reduced homology groups $\\tilde{H}_k(X)$ are trivial. A standard example of a contractible space is Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n \\ge 1$.\n\n3.  **Relationship and Context:**\n    - Every contractible space is simply connected. The homotopy that contracts the entire space to a point can be used to contract any loop to that point, proving $\\pi_1(X)=\\{e\\}$.\n    - The converse is not true. A space can be simply connected but not contractible. As mentioned, $S^3$ is simply connected but not contractible (its third homology group is non-trivial: $H_3(S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$).\n    - The **Poincaré Conjecture** (now a theorem) states that every closed, simply connected $3$-manifold is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere $S^3$. A **closed** manifold is one that is compact and has no boundary. It is a crucial fact that no closed manifold of dimension $n \\ge 1$ can be contractible. A closed, orientable $n$-manifold $M$ must have $H_n(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, whereas a contractible space must have $H_n(M)=0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A $3$-manifold $M$ is simply connected if it is path-connected and its fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is the trivial group; an example is the $3$-sphere $S^3$. A $3$-manifold $M$ is contractible if the identity map $\\operatorname{id}_M$ is homotopic to a constant map; an example is $\\mathbb{R}^3$.**\n\n- **Definition of Simply Connected:** \"if it is path-connected and its fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is the trivial group\". This is the correct, standard definition.\n- **Example of Simply Connected:** \"$S^3$\". This is a correct and primary example, especially in the context of the Poincaré conjecture.\n- **Definition of Contractible:** \"if the identity map $\\operatorname{id}_M$ is homotopic to a constant map\". This is a correct, standard definition.\n- **Example of Contractible:** \"$\\mathbb{R}^3$\". This is a correct and standard example of a contractible $3$-manifold.\n- **Overall:** All statements in this option are correct and precisely stated.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Simply connected means all homology groups $H_k(M)$ vanish for $k \\ge 1$, with an example $T^3$; contractible means $\\pi_1(M)$ is trivial, with an example $S^3$.**\n\n- **Definition of Simply Connected:** \"all homology groups $H_k(M)$ vanish for $k \\ge 1$\". This is the definition of an **acyclic** space (more precisely, an integral homology sphere if we only consider integer coefficients and the manifold is assumed connected). This is not the definition of simply connected. For instance, $S^3$ is simply connected, but $H_3(S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\neq 0$. This definition is incorrect.\n- **Example of Simply Connected:** \"$T^3$\". The $3$-torus is not simply connected; its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(T^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3$. This example is incorrect.\n- **Definition of Contractible:** \"$\\pi_1(M)$ is trivial\". This is the definition of simply connected (assuming path-connectedness), not contractible. A space can be simply connected without being contractible (e.g., $S^3$). This definition is incorrect.\n- **Example of Contractible:** \"$S^3$\". The $3$-sphere is not contractible. This example is incorrect.\n- **Overall:** This option contains multiple fundamental errors in definitions and examples.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A $3$-manifold $M$ is contractible if it is homotopy equivalent to a point; an example is $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A $3$-manifold $M$ is simply connected if it is path-connected and has trivial fundamental group; an example is $S^3$. Moreover, in the resolution of the Poincaré conjecture, any closed simply connected $3$-manifold is homeomorphic to $S^3$.**\n\n- **Definition of Contractible:** \"if it is homotopy equivalent to a point\". This is a correct, standard definition.\n- **Example of Contractible:** \"$\\mathbb{R}^3$\". This is a correct example.\n- **Definition of Simply Connected:** \"if it is path-connected and has trivial fundamental group\". This is the correct, standard definition.\n- **Example of Simply Connected:** \"$S^3$\". This is a correct example.\n- **Additional Statement:** \"Moreover, in the resolution of the Poincaré conjecture, any closed simply connected $3$-manifold is homeomorphic to $S^3$.\" This is a correct statement of the Poincaré-Perelman theorem and is fully consistent with the problem's context.\n- **Overall:** All statements are correct. The option completely and accurately fulfills the task requirements.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Contractible implies simply connected and therefore any closed contractible $3$-manifold must be $S^3$; examples: the $3$-ball $B^3$ is a closed contractible $3$-manifold, and $S^3$ is contractible.**\n\n- **First Clause:** \"Contractible implies simply connected\". This implication is correct. \"...and therefore any closed contractible $3$-manifold must be $S^3$\". This conclusion is fallacious. As established, no closed manifold (of dimension $\\ge 1$) can be contractible. A closed, contractible $3$-manifold would be simply connected and thus homeomorphic to $S^3$ by the Poincaré conjecture. However, $S^3$ is not contractible. The premise (existence of a closed, contractible $3$-manifold) is false.\n- **Example 1:** \"the $3$-ball $B^3$ is a closed contractible $3$-manifold\". The closed $3$-ball $B^3$ is contractible, but it is a manifold *with boundary* ($\\partial B^3 = S^2$). A **closed manifold** is by definition compact and has *no boundary*. Thus, $B^3$ is not a closed manifold. This statement is incorrect.\n- **Example 2:** \"$S^3$ is contractible\". This is incorrect. $S^3$ is not contractible.\n- **Overall:** This option contains multiple significant errors in logic and fact.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. A simply connected space is one in which every loop can be contracted to a point, but it need not be path-connected; example: $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. A contractible space admits a deformation retraction onto a point; example: $T^3$.**\n\n- **Definition of Simply Connected:** \"A simply connected space is one in which every loop can be contracted to a point, but it need not be path-connected\". The standard definition of \"simply connected\" explicitly requires the space to be path-connected. Omitting this requirement is a deviation from standard terminology, especially in the context of manifolds where connectedness and path-connectedness are equivalent. This definition is flawed.\n- **Example of Simply Connected:** \"$\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$\". This space is indeed path-connected and its fundamental group is trivial because it is homotopy equivalent to $S^2$, and $\\pi_1(S^2)=\\{e\\}$. So it *is* an example of a simply connected space, but it does not support the flawed part of the definition.\n- **Definition of Contractible:** \"A contractible space admits a deformation retraction onto a point\". This is a correct and equivalent definition of contractibility.\n- **Example of Contractible:** \"$T^3$\". The $3$-torus $T^3$ is not contractible. Its fundamental group alone, $\\pi_1(T^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3$, is sufficient to show it is not even simply connected. This example is incorrect.\n- **Overall:** The option contains a flawed definition and a false example.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3051620"}, {"introduction": "Richard Hamilton's brilliant idea was to use a geometric evolution equation, the Ricci flow $\\partial_{t} g = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}$, to deform a given $3$-manifold into a simpler shape.

The final answer should be a pair $(\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{r}), R(g_{r}))$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is a standard, fundamental calculation in Riemannian geometry. The object $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$ is a well-defined Riemannian manifold. All concepts (Ricci tensor, scalar curvature) are central to the field. The context given (\"Hamilton-Perelman's program\") is appropriate, as understanding the curvature of spheres is a prerequisite for studying Ricci flow. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: For a given Riemannian metric, the Riemann, Ricci, and scalar curvatures are uniquely determined. The problem is therefore well-posed.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in differential geometry that can be solved using the prescribed methods.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe manifold $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$ is a canonical example of a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature. This is a foundational fact about space forms. The dimension of the manifold is $n=3$. For a sphere of radius $r$ embedded in a Euclidean space, the constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$$\n\nFor any $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Riem}$, has a specific algebraic structure. In component notation, with respect to any local coordinate system, it is given by:\n$$R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$$\nwhere $R_{ijkl} = g_{im}R^m_{\\;jkl}$ are the components of the $(0,4)$-Riemann tensor.\n\n**1. Computation of the Ricci Tensor**\n\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, is obtained by performing a contraction on the Riemann tensor. Its components $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}$ are defined as:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = g^{lk}R_{lijk}$$\nNote that the contraction is over the first and third indices of the $(0,4)$-tensor $R_{lijk}$. We substitute the expression for the Riemann tensor of a constant curvature space:\n$$R_{lijk} = K(g_{li}g_{kj} - g_{lk}g_{ij})$$\nThe computation of the Ricci tensor components is as follows:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = g^{lk} [K(g_{li}g_{kj} - g_{lk}g_{ij})]$$\nBy linearity of the contraction, we can distribute $g^{lk}$ and factor out the constant $K$:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = K [g^{lk}(g_{li}g_{kj}) - g^{lk}(g_{lk}g_{ij})]$$\nWe evaluate the two terms inside the brackets separately.\nFor the first term:\n$$g^{lk}g_{li}g_{kj} = (g^{lk}g_{li})g_{kj}$$\nThe contraction $g^{lk}g_{li}$ is, by definition of the inverse metric, the Kronecker delta $\\delta^k_i$. So,\n$$(g^{lk}g_{li})g_{kj} = \\delta^k_i g_{kj} = g_{ij}$$\nFor the second term:\n$$g^{lk}g_{lk}g_{ij}$$\nThe contraction $g^{lk}g_{lk}$ is the trace of the identity tensor, which is the dimension of the manifold, $n$.\n$$g^{lk}g_{lk} = \\delta^k_k = \\sum_{k=1}^n 1 = n$$\nSo, the second term is $n g_{ij}$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = K [g_{ij} - n g_{ij}] = -(n-1)K g_{ij}$$\nThere appears to be a sign error in the derivation due to index convention. Let's re-verify the standard convention. The Ricci tensor is $R_{ik} = R^j_{ijk}$. This means $R_{ik} = g^{jl}R_{lijk}$. Let's use this standard definition. We need $R_{lijk} = K(g_{lk}g_{ij} - g_{li}g_{jk})$ as derived from $R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$ by swapping $i \\leftrightarrow l$.\nSo, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = g^{jl}R_{lijk} = g^{jl} K (g_{li} g_{jk} - g_{lj} g_{ik})$.\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = K( g^{jl}g_{li} g_{jk} - g^{jl}g_{lj} g_{ik} ) $$\n$$= K( (g^{jl}g_{li}) g_{jk} - (g^{jl}g_{lj}) g_{ik} ) $$\n$$= K( \\delta^j_i g_{jk} - \\delta^j_j g_{ik} ) $$\n$$= K( g_{ik} - n g_{ik} ) = -(n-1)K g_{ik}$$\nAnother sign issue. Let us be meticulous. The standard definition of the Riemann tensor is $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$. The components are $R^l_{kij}$. For constant sectional curvature $K$, $R_{ijkl} = K(g_{il}g_{jk} - g_{ik}g_{jl})$. The Ricci tensor is $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = R^j_{ijk} = g^{jl}R_{jlik}$.\nLet's use this definition:\n$$R_{jlik} = K(g_{jl}g_{ik} - g_{jk}g_{il})$$\nNow contract:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = g^{jl} R_{jlik} = g^{jl} K (g_{jl}g_{ik} - g_{jk}g_{il})$$\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = K [ (g^{jl}g_{jl}) g_{ik} - g^{jl}g_{jk}g_{il} ]$$\nThe term $g^{jl}g_{jl} = \\delta^l_l = n$.\nThe term $g^{jl}g_{jk}g_{il} = (g^{jl}g_{jk})g_{il} = \\delta^l_k g_{il} = g_{ik}$.\nSo,\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = K [ n g_{ik} - g_{ik} ] = (n-1)K g_{ik}$$\nThis is the correct, standard result. In tensor notation, this is $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)K g$.\n\nFor the specific case of $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$, we have $n=3$ and $K = 1/r^{2}$. The metric is $g_{r}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{r}) = (3-1) \\frac{1}{r^{2}} g_{r} = \\frac{2}{r^{2}} g_{r}$$\nThe Ricci tensor is a tensor field that is pointwise proportional to the metric tensor. The constant of proportionality, $2/r^2$, scales as the inverse square of the radius $r$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Scalar Curvature**\n\nThe scalar curvature, $R$, is obtained by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric:\n$$R = g^{ij}\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}$$\nUsing the general expression for the Ricci tensor components we just derived, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = (n-1)K g_{ij}$:\n$$R = g^{ij} [ (n-1)K g_{ij} ]$$\n$$R = (n-1)K (g^{ij}g_{ij})$$\nThe contraction $g^{ij}g_{ij} = \\delta^j_j = n$. Therefore:\n$$R = n(n-1)K$$\nThis is the general formula for the scalar curvature of an $n$-dimensional space of constant sectional curvature $K$.\n\nFor the specific case of $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$, we substitute $n=3$ and $K=1/r^2$:\n$$R(g_{r}) = 3(3-1) \\frac{1}{r^{2}} = 3(2) \\frac{1}{r^{2}} = \\frac{6}{r^{2}}$$\nThe scalar curvature is a constant function on the sphere with value $6/r^{2}$. This value scales as the inverse square of the radius $r$.\n\nThe two required quantities are $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{r}) = \\frac{2}{r^2} g_{r}$ and $R(g_{r}) = \\frac{6}{r^2}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{r^{2}} g_{r} & \\frac{6}{r^{2}} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3051561"}, {"introduction": "With the topological goal in mind and the geometric ingredients calculated, we can now see the Ricci flow in action on its most important model.

Assume the solution remains within the family of round metrics, so that $g(t) = r(t)^{2} g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ for some radius function $r(t)$. Use only the following foundational facts: for a metric of constant sectional curvature $K$ in dimension $n$, the Ricci tensor satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1) K\\, g$, and for the round metric on a sphere of radius $r$, the sectional curvature is $K = 1/r^{2}$.

The solution is assumed to remain within the family of round metrics. Thus, the metric at any time $t \\ge 0$ can be written as:\n$$\ng(t) = r(t)^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}\n$$\nwhere $r(t)$ is the radius of the sphere at time $t$, and $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ is the standard round metric on $S^3$ with constant sectional curvature equal to $1$. The initial condition is given by $g(0) = r_0^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}$, which implies $r(0) = r_0$.\n\nOur first step is to compute the left-hand side of the Ricci flow equation. We differentiate $g(t)$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( r(t)^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ is a fixed background metric, it is independent of time.

This requires finding the Ricci tensor of the metric $g(t)$. The metric $g(t) = r(t)^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ corresponds to a sphere of radius $r(t)$. According to the problem statement, a sphere of radius $r$ has constant sectional curvature $K = 1/r^2$. Therefore, the metric $g(t)$ has constant sectional curvature $K(t) = 1/r(t)^2$.\n\nThe problem also provides the formula for the Ricci tensor of a metric with constant sectional curvature $K$ in dimension $n$: $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1) K g$. For our case, $n=3$ and $K = K(t) = 1/r(t)^2$.

We determine $C$ using the initial condition $r(0) = r_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} r(0)^2 = -2(0) + C \\implies C = \\frac{1}{2} r_0^2\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the solution, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} r(t)^2 = -2t + \\frac{1}{2} r_0^2\n$$\nMultiplying by $2$ gives the expression for $r(t)^2$:\n$$\nr(t)^2 = r_0^2 - 4t\n$$\nTaking the square root, we find the radius as a function of time:\n$$\nr(t) = \\sqrt{r_0^2 - 4t}\n$$\nWe take the positive root since the radius must be non-negative.\n\nThe extinction time $T$ is the time at which the manifold collapses to a point, meaning its radius becomes zero. We find $T$ by setting $r(T) = 0$:\n$$\n0 = \\sqrt{r_0^2 - 4T}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$\n0 = r_0^2 - 4T\n$$\nSolving for $T$, we obtain the finite extinction time:\n$$\n4T = r_0^2\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{r_0^2}{4}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r_0^2}{4}}$$", "id": "3051624"}]}
