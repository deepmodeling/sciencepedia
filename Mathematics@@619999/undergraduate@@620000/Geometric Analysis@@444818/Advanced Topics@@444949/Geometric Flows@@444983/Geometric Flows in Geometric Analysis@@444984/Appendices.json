It is a standard initial value problem for the linear heat equation on a compact manifold, the unit circle $S^1$.

The time-evolution of the amplitude of the $k$-th mode is governed by the factor $\\exp(-k^2 t)$. Since $k^2 > 0$ for all $k \\geq 1$, this factor represents an exponential decay. The constant mode ($k=0$) does not decay, as $\\exp(0) = 1$. This is because the heat equation is a diffusion equation; it smooths out irregularities. Since the functions $\\cos(k\\theta)$ and $\\sin(k\\theta)$ are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, the heat flow simply scales their amplitudes without mixing different frequencies. The negative eigenvalues of the Laplacian for non-constant modes directly lead to this decay.\n\n2.  **Rate of Decay**: The rate of decay for the $k$-th mode is given by the constant in the exponent, which is $k^2$. This means that higher-frequency modes (large $k$), which correspond to sharp spatial variations, decay much more rapidly than low-frequency modes (small $k$). The decay rate is proportional to the square of the wave number $k$.\n\n3.  **Long-time Limit**: To find the long-time limit, we evaluate $u(\\theta,t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n    For any $k \\geq 1$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-k^2 t) = 0\n    $$\n    The $k=0$ term remains constant. Assuming we can interchange the limit and the summation (which is justified by the rapid convergence of the series for any $t>0$), we find:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} u(\\theta,t) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-k^2 t) \\right) \\left( a_k \\cos(k\\theta) + b_k \\sin(k\\theta) \\right) = \\frac{a_0}{2}\n    $$\n    The coefficient $a_0$ is defined by the standard Fourier integral $a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} u(\\theta,0) d\\theta$.

The unit tangent is $T = \\frac{(1, y_x)}{\\sqrt{1+y_x^2}}$. Rotating by $+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ gives $\\mathbf{N} = \\frac{(-y_x, 1)}{\\sqrt{1+y_x^2}}$.\nThe signed curvature $\\kappa$ for a graph $y(x)$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{y_{xx}}{(1+y_x^2)^{3/2}} $$\nThe geometric evolution law for Curve Shortening Flow (CSF) states that the normal component of the velocity of the curve equals the curvature. For an evolving graph, this relationship is expressed as $X_t \\cdot \\mathbf{N} = \\kappa$.\nWe compute the dot product:\n$$ X_t \\cdot \\mathbf{N} = (0, y_t) \\cdot \\frac{(-y_x, 1)}{\\sqrt{1+y_x^2}} = \\frac{y_t}{\\sqrt{1+y_x^2}} $$\nEquating this with the curvature gives the evolution equation for $y(x,t)$:\n$$ \\frac{y_t}{\\sqrt{1+y_x^2}} = \\frac{y_{xx}}{(1+y_x^2)^{3/2}} $$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{1+y_x^2}$ yields the fully nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) for CSF of a graph:\n$$ y_t = \\frac{y_{xx}}{1+y_x^2} $$\nThe problem assumes a small slope, which means $|y_x| \\ll 1$. In this limit, we can approximate the denominator by taking the Taylor expansion of $\\frac{1}{1+p^2}$ around $p=0$, which is $1 - p^2 + O(p^4)$. The leading-order term is $1$.\nThus, for small slopes, $1+y_x^2 \\approx 1$. The evolution equation simplifies to the linear heat equation:\n$$ y_t = y_{xx} $$\nThe endpoints of the curve are fixed at $(0,0)$ and $(L,0)$ for all time $t \\ge 0$. This translates to boundary conditions on the function $y(x,t)$. At $x=0$, the position is $(0, y(0,t))$, which must be $(0,0)$, so $y(0,t)=0$. Similarly, at $x=L$, the position is $(L, y(L,t))$, which must be $(L,0)$, so $y(L,t)=0$.\nThe boundary conditions are therefore Dirichlet conditions:\n$$ y(0,t) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y(L,t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge 0 $$\n\n**2) Boundary Conditions on Curvature $\\kappa$**\n\nThe endpoints are fixed in space, meaning their velocity is zero.\nAt $x=0$, $X(0,t) = (0,0)$, so its velocity is $X_t(0,t) = (0,0)$.\nAt $x=L$, $X(L,t) = (L,0)$, so its velocity is $X_t(L,t) = (0,0)$.\nThe problem states the geometric evolution law is $X_t = \\kappa \\, \\mathbf{N}$, meaning the velocity of any point on the curve is purely normal and its magnitude is $|\\kappa|$.\nAt the endpoints, this law must hold. Thus, at $x=0$ and $x=L$, we have $\\kappa \\mathbf{N} = \\vec{0}$.\nSince $\\mathbf{N}$ is a unit vector, its magnitude is $|\\mathbf{N}|=1$. Therefore, the scalar curvature $\\kappa$ must be zero at the endpoints for all time $t$.\n$$ \\kappa(0,t) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\kappa(L,t) = 0 $$\nThis can be confirmed from the PDE derived in part 1). Since $y(0,t)=0$ for all $t$, its time derivative is also zero: $y_t(0,t)=0$. From the PDE $y_t = \\frac{y_{xx}}{1+y_x^2}$, this implies $\\frac{y_{xx}(0,t)}{1+y_x(0,t)^2} = 0$, which requires $y_{xx}(0,t)=0$. Since $\\kappa = \\frac{y_{xx}}{(1+y_x^2)^{3/2}}$, zero second derivative implies zero curvature, provided the slope $y_x$ is finite. A similar argument holds at $x=L$.\n\n**3) Justification of Short-Time Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nThe full evolution equation is $y_t = \\frac{y_{xx}}{1+y_x^2}$. This is a quasilinear parabolic PDE. We can write it in the form $y_t = F(y_x, y_{xx})$. The equation is parabolic because the coefficient of the highest-order spatial derivative, $y_{xx}$, is $a(y_x) = \\frac{1}{1+y_x^2}$. Since $y_x$ is a real-valued function, $y_x^2 \\ge 0$, which means $1+y_x^2 \\ge 1$. Therefore, the coefficient $a(y_x)$ is strictly positive, $0  a(y_x) \\le 1$.\nThe standard theory of quasilinear parabolic equations guarantees that for smooth initial data $y(x,0)$ that is compatible with the boundary conditions (i.e., $y(0,0)=0$ and $y(L,0)=0$), there exists a unique smooth solution $y(x,t)$ for a short time interval $t \\in [0,T)$ for some $T>0$. The assumption of small initial slope ensures that the function $y$ and its derivatives remain bounded, and the coefficients of the PDE are smooth and well-behaved, fulfilling the requirements for the application of existence and uniqueness theorems (which are often based on the contraction mapping principle in appropriate function spaces like Hölder or Sobolev spaces).\n\n**4) Curvature at the Midpoint**\n\nWe solve the linearized problem derived in part 1):\n- PDE: $y_t = y_{xx}$ for $x \\in (0,L), t>0$.\n- BCs: $y(0,t) = 0$, $y(L,t) = 0$.\n- IC: $y(x,0) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\nThis is a standard initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation. We use the method of separation of variables. The general solution satisfying the BCs is a Fourier sine series:\n$$ y(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) $$\nTo satisfy the initial condition, we set $t=0$:\n$$ y(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nBy inspection, we find that the coefficients are $B_1 = A$ and $B_n = 0$ for all $n > 1$.\nThus, the solution is:\n$$ y(x,t) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the curvature $\\kappa$ at the midpoint $x=\\frac{L}{2}$. The formula for curvature is $\\kappa = \\frac{y_{xx}}{(1+y_x^2)^{3/2}}$. We need the first and second spatial derivatives of $y(x,t)$.\n$$ y_x(x,t) = A \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) $$\n$$ y_{xx}(x,t) = -A \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) $$\nEvaluate these derivatives at the midpoint $x = \\frac{L}{2}$:\n$$ y_x\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, t\\right) = A \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ y_{xx}\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, t\\right) = -A \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) = -A \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) $$\nFinally, substitute these values into the curvature formula:\n$$ \\kappa\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, t\\right) = \\frac{y_{xx}\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, t\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\left(y_x\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, t\\right)\\right)^2\\right)^{3/2}} = \\frac{-A \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right)}{(1 + 0^2)^{3/2}} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\kappa\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, t\\right) = -A \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) $$\nRe-writing in a standard form gives the final expression for the curvature at the midpoint.\n$$ \\kappa\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, t\\right) = -A \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right) $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-A \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^{2} t}{L^{2}}\\right)} $$", "id": "3050282"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice culminates with the celebrated Ricci flow, the tool famously used to prove the Poincaré conjecture.

The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g = -R(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g.\n$$\nFor a $2$-dimensional manifold (a surface), the Ricci tensor is related to the Gauss curvature $K$ by the given formula $\\mathrm{Ric} = K\\,g$. The scalar curvature $R$ is thus\n$$\nR = \\mathrm{tr}_g(\\mathrm{Ric}) = \\mathrm{tr}_g(K\\,g) = K\\,\\mathrm{tr}_g(g).\n$$\nThe trace of the metric tensor $g$ is the dimension of the manifold, which is $2$. Therefore,\n$$\nR = 2K.\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the evolution of the area form:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g = -(2K)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g = -2K\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g.\n$$\nNow, we can compute the time derivative of the total area $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\int_{S^2} (-2K\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g) = -2\\int_{S^2} K\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g.\n$$\nThe integral of the Gauss curvature over the $2$-sphere is given by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} K\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g = 2\\pi\\,\\chi(S^2).\n$$\nWe are given that the Euler characteristic of the $2$-sphere is $\\chi(S^2)=2$. Thus, the integral is a topological invariant, independent of the metric $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} K\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_g = 2\\pi(2) = 4\\pi.\n$$\nSubstituting this constant value into the equation for $\\frac{d}{dt}A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = -2(4\\pi) = -8\\pi.\n$$\nThis is the differential equation governing the evolution of the total area $A(t)$. It shows that the area decreases at a constant rate. We can solve this ordinary differential equation by direct integration with respect to time $t$, using the initial condition $A(0)=A_0$:\n$$\n\\int_{A_0}^{A(t)} dA' = \\int_0^t (-8\\pi)\\,dt'.\n$$\n$$\nA(t) - A_0 = -8\\pi t.\n$$\nThis gives the evolution of the total area:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 - 8\\pi t.\n$$\nSince the initial area $A_0$ is positive, the area $A(t)$ decreases linearly and will reach $0$ at a finite time. For a smooth Riemannian metric, the area must be strictly positive. The flow cannot be extended as a smooth solution with positive area beyond the time when $A(t)$ would become non-positive. This demonstrates that the flow becomes extinct in finite time.\n\nThe extinction time $T$ is the time at which the area vanishes. We find $T$ by setting $A(T)=0$:\n$$\n0 = A_0 - 8\\pi T.\n$$\nSolving for $T$, we get:\n$$\n8\\pi T = A_0 \\implies T = \\frac{A_0}{8\\pi}.\n$$\nThis is the maximal time of existence for the smooth Ricci flow on $S^2$ starting with a metric of area $A_0$. At this time, the manifold develops a singularity where the curvature blows up and the manifold \"shrinks to a point\".", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{A_0}{8\\pi}}$$", "id": "3065366"}]}
