Therefore, it is a valid problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the determination of a scalar function $C(t,x)$ that describes the evolution of the Riemannian volume form $d\\mu_{t}$ under the Ricci flow. The defining relation for $C(t,x)$ is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t} = C(t,x)\\, d\\mu_{t}\n$$\nThe Ricci flow equation for the family of metrics $g(t)$ on the $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ is:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2\\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of the metric $g(t)$.\n\nWe begin by expressing the volume form $d\\mu_t$ in local coordinates $x^1, \\dots, x^n$. Let $g_{ij}(t,x)$ be the components of the metric tensor $g(t)$ at the point $x \\in M$. The volume form is given by:\n$$\nd\\mu_{t} = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(t,x))} \\, dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nTo find its time evolution, we differentiate $d\\mu_t$ with respect to $t$. The coordinate basis $1$-forms $dx^i$ are independent of time, so the derivative only acts on the factor $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(t,x))}$.

For a differentiable matrix-valued function $A(t)$, the derivative of its determinant is given by $\\frac{d}{dt}\\det(A) = \\det(A) \\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1} \\frac{dA}{dt})$. Applying this to our matrix of metric components $G(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}(\\det(G)) = \\det(G) \\mathrm{tr}(G^{-1} \\partial_{t}G)\n$$\nIn terms of components, the inverse metric $G^{-1}$ has components $g^{ij}$, and the time derivative of the metric $\\partial_{t}G$ has components $\\partial_t g_{ij}$. The trace operation in this context corresponds to contraction of indices. Using the Einstein summation convention:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(G^{-1} \\partial_{t}G) = g^{ij} (\\partial_t g)_{ji} = g^{ij} \\partial_t g_{ij}\n$$\nThe last equality holds because the metric tensor is symmetric, $g_{ij} = g_{ji}$, which implies its time derivative is also symmetric, $\\partial_t g_{ij} = \\partial_t g_{ji}$.\n\nNow, we use the Ricci flow equation.

Substituting this into the expression for the trace:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(G^{-1} \\partial_{t}G) = g^{ij} (-2 R_{ij}) = -2 g^{ij} R_{ij}\n$$\nThe scalar curvature, denoted by $R$, is defined as the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric:\n$$\nR = \\mathrm{tr}_{g}(\\mathrm{Ric}) = g^{ij} R_{ij}\n$$\nTherefore, we find that:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(G^{-1} \\partial_{t}G) = -2 R\n$$\nWe can now substitute this result back into our expression for $\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(G)}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(G)} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\det(G)}} \\left( \\det(G) (-2 R) \\right) = -R \\sqrt{\\det(G)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for the time derivative of the volume form:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t} = \\left( -R \\sqrt{\\det(G)} \\right) dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nRecognizing that $d\\mu_t = \\sqrt{\\det(G)} \\, dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}$, we can write:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t} = -R \\, d\\mu_{t}\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the given equation $\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t} = C(t,x)\\, d\\mu_{t}$, we can identify the function $C(t,x)$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1) Derivation and Solution of the ODE for $u(t)$**\n\nThe evolution of the metric $g(t)$ is governed by the unnormalized Ricci flow equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nWe are given the ansatz that the metric remains a homothety of the initial metric $g_0$, i.e., $g(t) = u(t) g_0$, where $u(t)$ is a positive scaling factor with $u(0) = 1$.\n\nFirst, we compute the left-hand side (LHS) of the Ricci flow equation. Since $g_0$ is a constant metric in time, the time derivative acts only on the scaling factor $u(t)$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} (u(t) g_0) = \\frac{du}{dt} g_0\n$$\nNext, we compute the right-hand side (RHS). This requires finding the Ricci tensor of $g(t)$. For a two-dimensional manifold, the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}(g)$ is directly proportional to the metric $g$ itself, with the proportionality factor being the Gauss curvature $K(g)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t)) = K(g(t)) g(t)\n$$\nWe are given the scaling behavior of the Gauss curvature under a conformal change of metric $g = u g_0$ on a surface: $K(u g_0) = K(g_0) / u$. With the initial metric $g_0$ having constant Gauss curvature $K_0$, this becomes:\n$$\nK(g(t)) = \\frac{K_0}{u(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting this and the form of $g(t)$ into the expression for the Ricci tensor, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{K_0}{u(t)} (u(t) g_0) = K_0 g_0\n$$\nThis result is remarkably simple: the Ricci tensor remains constant in time under this homothetic evolution.\n\nNow, we can write the RHS of the Ricci flow equation as:\n$$\n-2 \\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t)) = -2 K_0 g_0\n$$\nEquating the LHS and RHS, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} g_0 = -2 K_0 g_0\n$$\nSince $g_0$ is a metric tensor, it is a non-degenerate tensor field. Thus, we can equate the scalar coefficients on both sides to obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $u(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = -2 K_0\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with a constant coefficient. We solve it by direct integration, subject to the initial condition $u(0)=1$:\n$$\n\\int_{u(0)}^{u(t)} du' = \\int_{0}^{t} (-2 K_0) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\nu(t) - u(0) = -2 K_0 (t - 0)\n$$\nSubstituting $u(0) = 1$:\n$$\nu(t) - 1 = -2 K_0 t\n$$\nThe explicit solution for the scaling factor is:\n$$\nu(t) = 1 - 2 K_0 t\n$$\n\n**2) Determination of the Extinction Time $T$**\n\nFor the second part, we specialize to the case where the manifold is the two-sphere, $M = S^2$, and the initial curvature is positive, $K_0 > 0$. The Ricci flow is said to form a singularity when the metric becomes degenerate. In our case, with $g(t) = u(t) g_0$, the metric degenerates if and only if the scaling factor $u(t)$ approaches zero. The extinction time $T$ is the finite time at which this occurs.\n\nWe set $u(T) = 0$ using the solution derived in part (1):\n$$\nu(T) = 1 - 2 K_0 T = 0\n$$\nSolving for $T$, we find:\n$$\n2 K_0 T = 1\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{2 K_0}\n$$\nSince $K_0 > 0$ is given, $T$ is a positive and finite value. This signifies that the sphere, when endowed with an initial metric of constant positive curvature (like the standard round metric), will shrink under the unnormalized Ricci flow and collapse to a point in finite time $T$. The initial area $A_0$ is related to $K_0$ via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, $\\int_{S^2} K_0 d\\mu_0 = K_0 A_0 = 2\\pi\\chi(S^2) = 4\\pi$, so $A_0 = 4\\pi/K_0$. The extinction time can also be expressed as $T = A_0/(8\\pi)$, but the problem asks for the answer in terms of $K_0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 - 2 K_{0} t  \\frac{1}{2 K_{0}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3062686"}, {"introduction": "Singularities in Ricci flow are not chaotic; they form along universal, self-similar models known as Ricci solitons.
