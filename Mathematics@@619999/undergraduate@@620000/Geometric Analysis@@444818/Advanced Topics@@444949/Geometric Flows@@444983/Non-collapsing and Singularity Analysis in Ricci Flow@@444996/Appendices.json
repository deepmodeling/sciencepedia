We proceed with the solution by addressing each task in order.\n\nLet $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ be the $n$-dimensional sphere with its canonical metric of constant sectional curvature $K_{\\mathrm{can}}=1$. The Ricci and scalar curvatures of this canonical metric are $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = (n-1)g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $R(g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = n(n-1)$, respectively.\n\n1. Derivation of Ricci and Scalar Curvature\n\nWe are given a sphere $S^n$ with the round metric $g = r^{2} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, where $r > 0$ is a radius parameter. The scaling of curvature tensors under a constant conformal change of metric $\\tilde{g} = c g$ (for $c > 0$ constant) is known. The sectional curvature $K$ scales as $\\tilde{K} = c^{-1} K$. The Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$ (as a $(0,2)$-tensor) is invariant, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\tilde{g}) = \\mathrm{Ric}(g)$. The scalar curvature $R$ scales as $\\tilde{R} = c^{-1} R$.\n\nApplying these rules with $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ as the base metric and $g$ as the scaled metric with scaling factor $c = r^2$:\nThe sectional curvature of $(S^n, g)$ is constant and given by\n$$K(g) = (r^2)^{-1} K(g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = \\frac{1}{r^2}.$$\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)K g$. Thus, for the metric $g=r^2 g_{\\mathrm{can}}$,\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(g) = (n-1) \\frac{1}{r^2} g.$$\nThe scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric, $R = \\mathrm{tr}_g(\\mathrm{Ric})$.\n$$R(g) = \\mathrm{tr}_g\\left(\\frac{n-1}{r^2} g\\right) = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} \\mathrm{tr}_g(g) = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} \\cdot n = \\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}.$$\nThis confirms the derivations for the first task.\n\n2. Ricci Flow Evolution\n\nThe Ricci flow equation is $\\partial_t g(t) = -2 \\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$. The initial condition is $g(0) = g_0 = r_0^2 g_{\\mathrm{can}}$.\nSince the initial metric is a round metric on $S^n$, its Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric itself. This symmetry suggests that the solution to the Ricci flow will preserve this form. Let us assume an ansatz of the form $g(t) = \\lambda(t) g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ for some positive function $\\lambda(t)$, where $\\lambda(0) = r_0^2$.  Note that $\\lambda(t)$ corresponds to the square of the radius, $\\lambda(t) = r(t)^2$.\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the flow equation:\nThe left-hand side is $\\partial_t (\\lambda(t) g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, since $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is a fixed background metric.\nFor the right-hand side, we use the result from part 1. The metric $g(t) = \\lambda(t) g_{\\mathrm{can}} = r(t)^2 g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ has Ricci tensor\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{n-1}{r(t)^2} g(t) = \\frac{n-1}{\\lambda(t)} g(t) = \\frac{n-1}{\\lambda(t)} (\\lambda(t) g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = (n-1) g_{\\mathrm{can}}.$$\nSo the Ricci flow equation becomes\n$$\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} g_{\\mathrm{can}} = -2 (n-1) g_{\\mathrm{can}}.$$\nBy equating the scalar coefficients of $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, we obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $\\lambda(t)$:\n$$\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -2(n-1).$$\nThis is a linear ODE with a constant coefficient. Integrating with respect to $t$ yields\n$$\\lambda(t) = -2(n-1)t + C,$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Using the initial condition $\\lambda(0) = r_0^2$, we find $C = r_0^2$.\nTherefore, the evolution of the metric scale factor is given by\n$$\\lambda(t) = r_0^2 - 2(n-1)t.$$\nThe radius of the sphere at time $t$ is $r(t) = \\sqrt{\\lambda(t)} = \\sqrt{r_0^2 - 2(n-1)t}$. The solution is valid for $t$ such that $\\lambda(t) > 0$. The preservation of the round metric form is justified by the uniqueness of the solution to the Ricci flow PDE for a given initial condition.\n\n3. Scalar Curvature and Extinction Time\n\nThe scalar curvature $R(t)$ along the flow is obtained by substituting $\\lambda(t) = r(t)^2$ into the formula from part 1:\n$$R(t) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{r(t)^2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{\\lambda(t)}.$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda(t)$:\n$$R(t) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{r_0^2 - 2(n-1)t}.$$\nThe flow develops a singularity as $t$ increases. This occurs when the denominator of $R(t)$ approaches zero, causing the curvature to blow up. The metric becomes degenerate as the radius $r(t)$ shrinks to $0$. The extinction time $T$ is the time at which $\\lambda(T) = 0$.\n$$r_0^2 - 2(n-1)T = 0.$$\nSolving for $T$, we find the extinction time:\n$$T = \\frac{r_0^2}{2(n-1)}.$$\n\n4. Blow-up Rate Constant\n\nWe are asked to compute the blow-up rate constant $L = \\lim_{t \\to T^{-}} (T - t) R(t)$.\nWe substitute the expressions for $R(t)$ and use the relation $r_0^2 = 2(n-1)T$:\n\\begin{align*} L &= \\lim_{t \\to T^{-}} (T - t) \\frac{n(n-1)}{r_0^2 - 2(n-1)t} \\\\ &= \\lim_{t \\to T^{-}} (T - t) \\frac{n(n-1)}{2(n-1)T - 2(n-1)t} \\\\ &= \\lim_{t \\to T^{-}} (T - t) \\frac{n(n-1)}{2(n-1)(T - t)}.\\end{align*}\nFor $t < T$, the term $(T-t)$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator:\n$$L = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2(n-1)} = \\frac{n}{2}.$$\nThis is the required blow-up rate constant, expressed in terms of $n$ only.\n\nRegarding the remaining analysis:\nThe singularity is of type-I because the curvature blows up at a controlled rate, specifically $|\\mathrm{Rm}(g(t))| \\le \\frac{C}{T-t}$ for some constant $C$ as $t \\to T^-$. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the norm of the Riemann tensor satisfies $|\\mathrm{Rm}| \\propto |K|$. In our case, the sectional curvature is $K(t) = 1/r(t)^2 = 1/(2(n-1)(T-t))$. Thus, $|\\mathrm{Rm}(g(t))|$ is directly proportional to $(T-t)^{-1}$, which satisfies the type-I condition.\n\nThe singularity is non-collapsed because, at scales below the curvature radius, the geometry locally resembles Euclidean space. The curvature radius is $r(t) = 1/\\sqrt{K(t)}$. For any geodesic ball $B(p, \\rho)$ with radius $\\rho$ much smaller than $r(t)$, its volume is $\\mathrm{Vol}(B(p, \\rho)) \\approx \\omega_n \\rho^n$, where $\\omega_n$ is the volume of the unit $n$-ball in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. More rigorously, since the Ricci curvature of the sphere is positive, the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem guarantees that for any $\\rho \\le r(t)$, the volume ratio $\\mathrm{Vol}(B(p,\\rho))/\\rho^n$ is bounded below by a positive constant $\\kappa > 0$ that depends only on the dimension $n$. This lower volume bound holds as $t \\to T$ and the curvature scale $r(t) \\to 0$, which is the definition of a non-collapsed singularity.

We need to compute the Ricci curvature tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ and the Hessian $\\nabla^{2}f$ for the given metric and function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n1.  **Ricci Curvature of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$**:\n    The metric $g$ is the flat Euclidean metric, with components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ in Cartesian coordinates. The Christoffel symbols of the first kind are $\\Gamma_{ijk} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_k g_{ij} + \\partial_j g_{ik} - \\partial_i g_{jk})$. Since the components $g_{ij}$ are constant, their partial derivatives are all zero. Thus, $\\Gamma_{ijk} = 0$ for all $i, j, k$.\n    The Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^{l}_{ij} = g^{lk}\\Gamma_{kij}$, are also all zero.\n    The Riemann curvature tensor is defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols: $R^{l}_{ijk} = \\partial_j \\Gamma^{l}_{ik} - \\partial_k \\Gamma^{l}_{ij} + \\Gamma^{m}_{ik}\\Gamma^{l}_{mj} - \\Gamma^{m}_{ij}\\Gamma^{l}_{mk}$. Since all $\\Gamma^{l}_{ij}$ are zero, the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero, $R^{l}_{ijk} = 0$.\n    The Ricci curvature tensor is the trace of the Riemann tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ik} = R^{j}_{ijk}$. Since the Riemann tensor is zero, the Ricci tensor is also identically zero: $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$.\n\n2.  **Hessian of $f$**:\n    The function is $f(x) = \\frac{|x|^{2}}{4\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{4\\lambda} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k^2$.\n    The components of the Hessian tensor $\\nabla^{2}f$ are given by $(\\nabla^{2}f)_{ij} = \\nabla_{i}(\\nabla_{j}f) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} - \\Gamma^{k}_{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_k}$.\n    As established, the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ are zero for the flat metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Therefore, the Hessian simplifies to the matrix of second partial derivatives: $(\\nabla^{2}f)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$.\n    We compute the derivatives:\n    - First partial derivative with respect to $x_j$:\n      $$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\lambda} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\lambda} (2x_j) = \\frac{x_j}{2\\lambda} $$\n    - Second partial derivative with respect to $x_i$ and $x_j$:\n      $$ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(\\frac{x_j}{2\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial x_j}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\delta_{ij} $$\n      where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n    Thus, the Hessian tensor is $(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\delta_{ij}$. As a tensor, this can be written as $\\nabla^2 f = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} g$, since $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\n3.  **Substituting into the soliton equation**:\n    We substitute our findings for $\\operatorname{Ric}$ and $\\nabla^{2}f$ into the left-hand side of the soliton equation:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Ric} + \\nabla^{2}f = 0 + \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} g = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} g $$\n    This matches the right-hand side of the given equation. The verification is complete.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the weighted volume.\nWe need to compute the integral:\n$$ I = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\exp(-f(x))\\,dV_{g} $$\nFor the flat metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the volume element is simply $dV_{g} = dx_1 dx_2 \\dots dx_n$. The function is $f(x) = \\frac{|x|^2}{4\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{4\\lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2$.\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n$$ I = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4\\lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2\\right) dx_1 \\dots dx_n $$\nThe exponential of a sum is a product of exponentials:\n$$ I = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_i^2}{4\\lambda}\\right) dx_1 \\dots dx_n $$\nBy Fubini's theorem, we can separate this multivariate integral into a product of one-dimensional integrals:\n$$ I = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_i^2}{4\\lambda}\\right) dx_i \\right) $$\nAll $n$ integrals are identical.
