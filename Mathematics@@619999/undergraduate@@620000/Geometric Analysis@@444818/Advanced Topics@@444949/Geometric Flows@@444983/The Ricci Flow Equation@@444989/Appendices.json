All premises are factually sound and all terms are formally defined.\n\nThe problem asks for a series of derivations concerning the evolution of a Riemannian metric $g(t)$ on a closed $n$-dimensional manifold $M^n$ under the Ricci flow. The Ricci flow equation is given by $\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2\\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$, where $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ is the Ricci tensor of the metric $g(t)$. Let's denote the components of the metric and Ricci tensors in a local coordinate system by $g_{ij}$ and $R_{ij}$, respectively.\n\n(a) We first derive the evolution equation for the Riemannian volume element $d\\mu_{t}$. In local coordinates, $d\\mu_{t} = \\sqrt{\\det(g(t))}\\,dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}$, where $\\det(g(t))$ is the determinant of the matrix of components $(g_{ij}(t))$. We are interested in the time derivative $\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t}$. The coordinate form $dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}$ is time-independent, so we only need to differentiate $\\sqrt{\\det(g(t))}$.\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g(t))} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\det(g(t))}} \\partial_{t}(\\det(g(t)))\n$$\nThe problem provides the identity $\\frac{d}{dt}\\ln\\det A(t)=\\mathrm{tr}\\left(A(t)^{-1}\\frac{d}{dt}A(t)\\right)$ for any smooth family of positive-definite matrices $A(t)$. Applying this to the metric tensor matrix $g(t)$, whose components are $g_{ij}(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\det(g(t))} \\partial_{t}(\\det(g(t))) = \\mathrm{tr}\\left(g(t)^{-1} \\partial_{t}g(t)\\right)\n$$\nIn index notation, the trace on the right-hand side is $g^{ij}(t)\\,\\partial_{t}g_{ij}(t)$, where $g^{ij}(t)$ are the components of the inverse metric. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}(\\det(g(t))) = \\det(g(t)) \\, g^{ij}(t)\\,\\partial_{t}g_{ij}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g(t))}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g(t))} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\det(g(t))}} \\left(\\det(g(t)) \\, g^{ij}(t)\\,\\partial_{t}g_{ij}(t)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\det(g(t))} \\, g^{ij}(t)\\,\\partial_{t}g_{ij}(t)\n$$\nThis directly implies the evolution of the volume element:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,g^{ij}(t)\\,\\partial_{t} g_{ij}(t)\\,d\\mu_{t}\n$$\nThis is the first required formula in part (a).\n\nNext, we use the Ricci flow equation, $\\partial_{t} g_{ij}(t) = -2\\,R_{ij}(t)$, where $R_{ij}(t)$ are the components of the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$.

Therefore, we arrive at the second required result:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t} = -R(\\cdot,t)\\,d\\mu_{t}\n$$\n\n(b) The total volume of the manifold at time $t$ is given by $V(t) := \\int_{M} d\\mu_{t}$. To find its time evolution, we differentiate $V(t)$ with respect to $t$. Since $M$ is a closed (compact and without boundary) manifold and the solution is smooth, we can interchange differentiation and integration (by the Leibniz integral rule):\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}V(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{M} d\\mu_{t} = \\int_{M} \\partial_{t}d\\mu_{t}\n$$\nUsing the result from part (a), $\\partial_{t} d\\mu_{t} = -R(\\cdot,t)\\,d\\mu_{t}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}V(t) = \\int_{M} \\left(-R(\\cdot,t)\\,d\\mu_{t}\\right) = -\\int_{M}R(\\cdot,t)\\,d\\mu_{t}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the rate of change of the total volume is equal to the negative of the integrated scalar curvature. For short times $t \\in [0, \\varepsilon)$, the sign of the scalar curvature $R(\\cdot, t)$ will be close to that of the initial scalar curvature $R(\\cdot, 0)$.\nThe interpretation is as follows:\n- If the initial scalar curvature is positive everywhere on $M$, i.e., $R(\\cdot, 0) > 0$, then for short times $t$, $R(\\cdot, t)$ will remain positive. The integral $\\int_{M}R(\\cdot,t)\\,d\\mu_{t}$ will be positive, and thus $\\frac{d}{dt}V(t) < 0$. The volume of the manifold will decrease.\n- If the initial scalar curvature is negative everywhere on $M$, i.e., $R(\\cdot, 0) < 0$, then for short times $t$, the integrated scalar curvature will be negative, and thus $\\frac{d}{dt}V(t) > 0$. The volume of the manifold will increase.\n- If the manifold is initially Ricci-flat, $R_{ij}(0) = 0$, which implies $R(\\cdot, 0)=0$, then the Ricci flow holds the metric constant, $g(t)=g(0)$, and $\\frac{d}{dt}V(t)=0$. The volume is conserved.\n\n(c) We now consider the special case where the initial metric $g(0)=g_{0}$ is an Einstein metric, meaning $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{0})=\\lambda\\, g_{0}$ for some constant $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$.

Integrating this with the initial condition $\\rho(0)=1$ yields:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = -2\\lambda t + C \\quad \\implies \\quad \\rho(0) = C = 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\rho(t) = 1 - 2\\lambda t\n$$\nNow we find the volume $V(t)$. The volume element of $g(t)=\\rho(t)g_0$ is related to that of $g_0$ by $d\\mu_{t} = (\\rho(t))^{n/2} d\\mu_{0}$.\nThe total volume is then:\n$$\nV(t) = \\int_{M} d\\mu_{t} = \\int_{M} (\\rho(t))^{n/2} d\\mu_{0} = (\\rho(t))^{n/2} \\int_{M} d\\mu_{0} = (\\rho(t))^{n/2} V_{0}\n$$\nwhere $V_{0} = V(0) = \\int_{M} d\\mu_{0}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho(t)$:\n$$\nV(t) = (1 - 2\\lambda t)^{n/2} V_{0}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in terms of $R_{0}$, the initial scalar curvature. For an Einstein metric $g_0$ with $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{0}) = \\lambda\\, g_{0}$, the scalar curvature $R_{0}$ is:\n$$\nR_{0} = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_0}(\\mathrm{Ric}(g_0)) = g_{0}^{ij}(\\lambda\\, (g_{0})_{ij}) = \\lambda\\, g_{0}^{ij}(g_{0})_{ij} = \\lambda\\, \\delta^{i}_{i} = n\\lambda\n$$\nThis gives $\\lambda = \\frac{R_{0}}{n}$. Substituting this into our expression for $V(t)$:\n$$\nV(t) = \\left(1 - 2\\left(\\frac{R_{0}}{n}\\right)t\\right)^{n/2} V_{0} = V_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{2R_{0}t}{n}\\right)^{n/2}\n$$\nThis provides the exact closed-form expression for the volume $V(t)$ for all $t$ for which the rescaled metric remains a valid Riemannian metric, i.e., for which $1 - \\frac{2R_{0}t}{n} > 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{V_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{2R_{0}t}{n}\\right)^{n/2}}\n$$", "id": "3062196"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the standard Ricci flow alters a manifold's volume, a natural next step is to ask if we can modify the flow to preserve it, allowing us to study changes in shape independently of changes in size.

Thus, its Ricci tensor is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g_p(t)) = \\frac{p-1}{a(t)^2} g_p(t) = \\frac{p-1}{a(t)^2} \\left(a(t)^2 g_{S^p(1)}\\right) = (p-1) g_{S^p(1)}\n$$\nSimilarly, for the second factor, $(S^q, g_q(t))$, with $n=q$ and $R=b(t)$, the Ricci tensor is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g_q(t)) = \\frac{q-1}{b(t)^2} g_q(t) = \\frac{q-1}{b(t)^2} \\left(b(t)^2 g_{S^q(1)}\\right) = (q-1) g_{S^q(1)}\n$$\nThe Ricci tensor of the product manifold $g(t) = g_p(t) \\oplus g_q(t)$ is the direct sum of the Ricci tensors of its factors:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g_p(t)) \\oplus \\operatorname{Ric}(g_q(t))\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we found:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = (p-1) g_{S^{p}(1)} \\oplus (q-1) g_{S^{q}(1)}\n$$\nThis gives the RHS of the Ricci flow equation, up to a factor of $-2$:\n$$\n-2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = -2(p-1) g_{S^{p}(1)} \\oplus -2(q-1) g_{S^{q}(1)}\n$$\n\n**Assembling the System of ODEs**\n\nWe now equate the LHS and RHS of the Ricci flow equation:\n$$\n(2a\\dot{a}) g_{S^{p}(1)} \\oplus (2b\\dot{b}) g_{S^{q}(1)} = -2(p-1) g_{S^{p}(1)} \\oplus -2(q-1) g_{S^{q}(1)}\n$$\nSince $g_{S^{p}(1)}$ and $g_{S^{q}(1)}$ form a basis for the metric components, we can equate their coefficients.\n\nFor the $S^p$ component:\n$$\n2a(t)\\dot{a}(t) = -2(p-1)\n$$\n$$\na(t)\\dot{a}(t) = -(p-1)\n$$\nAssuming $a(t) > 0$, we can solve for $\\dot{a}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{a}(t) = -\\frac{p-1}{a(t)}\n$$\n\nFor the $S^q$ component:\n$$\n2b(t)\\dot{b}(t) = -2(q-1)\n$$\n$$\nb(t)\\dot{b}(t) = -(q-1)\n$$\nAssuming $b(t) > 0$, we can solve for $\\dot{b}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{b}(t) = -\\frac{q-1}{b(t)}\n$$\n\nThis is the closed system of ODEs for the radii $a(t)$ and $b(t)$. The right-hand sides of the ODEs for $\\dot{a}(t)$ and $\\dot{b}(t)$ are $-\\frac{p-1}{a(t)}$ and $-\\frac{q-1}{b(t)}$, respectively. The problem asks for these expressions to be formatted as a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{p-1}{a(t)} & -\\frac{q-1}{b(t)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3074738"}]}
