The derivation must be performed at a point $p \\in M$ using normal coordinates and must rely only on foundational definitions. The dimension of the manifold is $n=2$.\n\nFirst, we determine the general form of the Riemann curvature tensor $R_{ijk\\ell}$ in two dimensions using its algebraic symmetries. The Riemann tensor satisfies the following symmetries:\n1. Antisymmetry in the first two indices: $R_{ijk\\ell} = -R_{jik\\ell}$\n2. Antisymmetry in the last two indices: $R_{ijk\\ell} = -R_{ij\\ell k}$\n3. Block symmetry: $R_{ijk\\ell} = R_{k\\ell ij}$\n4. First Bianchi identity: $R_{ijk\\ell} + R_{ik\\ell j} + R_{i\\ell jk} = 0$\n\nIn a two-dimensional space, the indices $i, j, k, \\ell$ can only take values from $\\{1, 2\\}$. Due to the antisymmetry properties, a component $R_{ijk\\ell}$ can be non-zero only if $i \\neq j$ and $k \\neq \\ell$. This means the only potentially non-zero components are permutations of $R_{1212}$. All other components, such as $R_{1112}$ or $R_{1211}$, are zero. Consequently, the Riemann tensor is determined by a single independent component, for instance $R_{1212}$.\n\nThe space of tensors of type $(0,4)$ that satisfy all the algebraic symmetries of the Riemann tensor is one-dimensional in $n=2$ dimensions. This space is spanned by the tensor $g_{i\\ell}g_{jk} - g_{ik}g_{j\\ell}$. Therefore, the Riemann tensor must be proportional to this tensor:\n$$R_{ijk\\ell} = C(p) (g_{i\\ell}g_{jk} - g_{ik}g_{j\\ell})$$\nwhere $C(p)$ is a scalar function on $M$.\n\nNext, we determine the function $C(p)$ using the definition of the Gauss curvature $K$. The problem states that $K$ is the sectional curvature of the unique $2$-plane $T_pM$. The sectional curvature for a plane spanned by two orthonormal vectors $u, v$ is defined as $K(u,v) = R(u,v,v,u)$. We work at point $p$ in normal coordinates, where the metric tensor is the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij}(p) = \\delta_{ij}$, and its first derivatives vanish. The coordinate basis vectors $e_1 = \\partial_1$ and $e_2 = \\partial_2$ are orthonormal at $p$. The Gauss curvature $K$ at $p$ is thus given by:\n$$K(p) = R(e_1, e_2, e_2, e_1) = R_{1221}(p)$$\nWe use our expression for the Riemann tensor to evaluate $R_{1221}(p)$:\n$$R_{1221}(p) = C(p) (g_{11}(p)g_{22}(p) - g_{12}(p)g_{21}(p))$$\nSubstituting $g_{ij}(p) = \\delta_{ij}$:\n$$K(p) = C(p) (1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0) = C(p)$$\nThus, the scalar function $C(p)$ is precisely the Gauss curvature $K(p)$. Dropping the explicit dependence on $p$ for notational clarity, we have the general tensor equation for the Riemann tensor in two dimensions:\n$$R_{ijk\\ell} = K (g_{i\\ell}g_{jk} - g_{ik}g_{j\\ell})$$\nThis equation, derived at $p$ using normal coordinates, is a tensor equation and is therefore valid in any coordinate system.\n\nNow, we derive the Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, which is defined as a metric contraction of the Riemann tensor. The standard definition is $\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj} = R^i{}_{kij} = g^{i\\ell}R_{ikj\\ell}$. We substitute our expression for the Riemann tensor:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj} = g^{i\\ell} [K (g_{i\\ell}g_{kj} - g_{ij}g_{k\\ell})]$$\nSince $K$ is a scalar, we can pull it out of the contraction:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj} = K [g^{i\\ell}(g_{i\\ell}g_{kj} - g_{ij}g_{k\\ell})]$$\nDistributing the metric $g^{i\\ell}$ over the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj} = K [ (g^{i\\ell}g_{i\\ell})g_{kj} - (g^{i\\ell}g_{ij})g_{k\\ell} ]$$\nWe evaluate the contractions of the metric tensor. The contraction $g^{i\\ell}g_{i\\ell}$ is the trace of the identity matrix, which is the dimension of the manifold, $n$. Here, $n=2$:\n$$g^{i\\ell}g_{i\\ell} = \\delta^i_i = n = 2$$\nThe contraction $g^{i\\ell}g_{ij}$ yields a Kronecker delta:\n$$g^{i\\ell}g_{ij} = \\delta^\\ell_j$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the Ricci tensor:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj} = K [ n g_{kj} - \\delta^\\ell_j g_{k\\ell} ]$$\nContracting the Kronecker delta with the metric gives $\\delta^\\ell_j g_{k\\ell} = g_{kj}$.\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj} = K [ n g_{kj} - g_{kj} ] = (n-1) K g_{kj}$$\nFor a two-dimensional manifold, $n=2$, so this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj} = (2-1) K g_{kj} = K g_{kj}$$\nIn coordinate-free notation, the expression for the Ricci tensor is $\\mathrm{Ric} = K g$.\n\nFinally, we derive the scalar curvature $R$. The scalar curvature is defined as the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric:\n$$R = g^{kj}\\mathrm{Ric}_{kj}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for the Ricci tensor:\n$$R = g^{kj}(K g_{kj})$$\nSince $K$ is a scalar, it can be factored out:\n$$R = K (g^{kj}g_{kj})$$\nThe contraction $g^{kj}g_{kj}$ is again the dimension of the manifold, $n=2$:\n$$g^{kj}g_{kj} = \\delta^j_j = n=2$$\nTherefore, the scalar curvature is:\n$$R = K n = 2K$$\n\nThe derived expressions at the point $p$ for the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature are $\\mathrm{Ric} = K g$ and $R = 2K$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nK g & 2K\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3047085"}, {"introduction": "With the geometric stage set, we now observe the Ricci flow in action on its simplest, non-trivial examples: surfaces of initially constant curvature.

With $R_{ij} = K g_{ij}$, we have $R^{ij} = g^{ik}g^{jl}R_{kl} = g^{ik}g^{jl}(K g_{kl}) = K g^{ij}$.\nThus, the squared norm is:\n$$\n|\\mathrm{Ric}|_g^2 = R_{ij} R^{ij} = (K g_{ij}) (K g^{ij}) = K^2 (g_{ij} g^{ij}) = K^2 \\delta^i_i = K^2 \\cdot \\dim(M)\n$$\nSince the manifold is two-dimensional, $\\dim(M)=2$, and we get:\n$$\n|\\mathrm{Ric}|_g^2 = 2K^2\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the evolution equation for $R$:\n$$\n2 \\partial_{t} K = 2 \\Delta K + 2 (2K^2)\n$$\nDividing by $2$ yields the evolution equation for the Gauss curvature $K$ on a surface under Ricci flow:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} K = \\Delta K + 2K^2\n$$\nThis is a reaction-diffusion equation for $K(x,t)$. The problem states that the initial curvature is spatially constant, i.e., $K(x, 0) = K_0$ for all $x \\in M$.

The PDE then simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $K(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dt} = 2K^2\n$$\nBy the uniqueness of solutions to this parabolic PDE on a compact manifold, if the initial data is constant, the solution must remain constant in space for all time. Thus, solving this ODE provides the correct evolution for $K(t)$.\n\nThe ODE is separable and can be solved with the initial condition $K(0) = K_0$.\nFirst, consider the case $K_0 = 0$.
