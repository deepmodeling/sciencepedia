First, to derive the general coordinate expression for the Hessian of a smooth function $f$. Second, to compute this Hessian explicitly for a radial function $f(x)=F(r)$.\n\nThe Hessian of a smooth function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor field, denoted $\\nabla^2 f$, defined as the covariant derivative of the differential of $f$, $df$. The components of the covariant derivative of a covector field $\\omega$ with components $\\omega_j$ are given by the formula:\n$$(\\nabla_i \\omega)_j = \\partial_i \\omega_j - \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\omega_k$$\nwhere $\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ and $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind associated with the Levi-Civita connection of the metric $g$.\n\nTo find the components of the Hessian, we substitute $\\omega_j = (df)_j = \\partial_j f$ into the formula:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\nabla_i (\\partial_j f) = \\partial_i(\\partial_j f) - \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\partial_k f$$\nThis expression is more commonly written as:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^i \\partial x^j} - \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^k}$$\nThis is the general coordinate expression for the components of the Hessian of a function $f$.\n\nNow, we specialize this result to the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},\\delta)$, where $\\delta$ is the Euclidean metric. In standard Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, the components of the metric tensor are given by the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, which are constants. The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the derivatives of the metric components:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)$$\nSince all components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant, all their partial derivatives are zero. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i, j, k$.\n\nSubstituting $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ into the general expression for the Hessian, we find that for the Euclidean metric in Cartesian coordinates, the Hessian components simplify to the ordinary second partial derivatives of the function:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$$\n\nThe final part of the problem requires computing these components for a radial function $f(x)=F(r)$, where $r = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + \\dots + x_n^2}$. We proceed by applying the chain rule.\n\nFirst, we compute the first partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x_i$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{dF}{dr} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x_i}$$\nWe need the partial derivative of $r$.

Substituting these in:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\frac{x_i}{r} = \\frac{r \\delta_{ij} - x_i \\frac{x_j}{r}}{r^2} = \\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{r} - \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^3}$$\nSo the second term is:\n$$F'(r) \\left( \\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{r} - \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^3} \\right)$$\n\nCombining both terms, we obtain the final expression for the Hessian components:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = F''(r) \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2} + F'(r) \\left( \\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{r} - \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^3} \\right)$$\nThis can be rearranged by grouping terms with $\\delta_{ij}$ and $x_i x_j$:\n$$(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\frac{F'(r)}{r} \\delta_{ij} + \\left( F''(r) - \\frac{F'(r)}{r} \\right) \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2}$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the Hessian components of a radial function on Euclidean space, expressed in terms of $r$, $x_i$, $x_j$, $\\delta_{ij}$, $F'(r)$, and $F''(r)$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{F'(r)}{r} \\delta_{ij} + \\left( F''(r) - \\frac{F'(r)}{r} \\right) \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2}}$$", "id": "3060860"}, {"introduction": "The Ricci soliton equation, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} + \\nabla^{2} f = \\lambda g$, represents a precise balance between curvature and the potential function's Hessian.
