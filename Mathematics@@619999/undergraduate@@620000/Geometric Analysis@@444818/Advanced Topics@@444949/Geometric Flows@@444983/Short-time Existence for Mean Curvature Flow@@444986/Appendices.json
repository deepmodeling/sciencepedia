No rounding is required, and no units should be used in the answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the mean curvature vector $\\mathbf{H}$ for a round sphere $S^{n}_{R}$ of radius $R>0$ embedded in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The calculation must be derived from the first principles and definitions provided.\n\nThe sphere is defined as the set of points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $\\|x\\| = R$. The outward-pointing unit normal vector field is given by $\\nu(x) = x/R$. The shape operator, $S$, also known as the Weingarten map, is defined with respect to $\\nu$ by the relation $S(X) = -\\nabla_{X}\\nu$ for any vector $X$ tangent to the sphere. Here, $\\nabla$ denotes the standard Levi-Civita connection on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The scalar mean curvature $H$ is the trace of the shape operator, $H = \\text{tr}(S)$, and the mean curvature vector is $\\mathbf{H} = H\\nu$.\n\nOur first step is to compute the action of the shape operator $S$ on a tangent vector $X \\in T_pS^n_R$ at a point $p \\in S^n_R$. To compute the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X\\nu$, we can use any smooth curve $\\gamma(t)$ on the sphere $S^n_R$ such that $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=X$. The derivative of the vector field $\\nu$ along the curve $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$ \\nabla_X\\nu \\equiv \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\nu \\big|_{t=0} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu(\\gamma(t)) $$\nSince $\\nabla$ is the Euclidean connection, this derivative is the standard component-wise differentiation of the vector field's coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Using the given expression for the normal field, $\\nu(x) = x/R$:\n$$ \\nu(\\gamma(t)) = \\frac{\\gamma(t)}{R} $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $t$ and evaluating at $t=0$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\frac{\\gamma(t)}{R} = \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\frac{1}{R} \\gamma'(0) $$\nBy our definition of the curve $\\gamma$, we have $\\gamma'(0) = X$. Therefore, for any tangent vector $X \\in T_pS^n_R$, the covariant derivative of the normal field is:\n$$ \\nabla_X\\nu = \\frac{1}{R} X $$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the definition of the shape operator:\n$$ S(X) = -\\nabla_X\\nu = -\\frac{1}{R} X $$\nThis expression shows that the shape operator $S$ at any point on the sphere is simply multiplication by the scalar $-1/R$. It is a linear transformation $S: T_pS^n_R \\to T_pS^n_R$ given by $S = -\\frac{1}{R} \\mathrm{Id}$, where $\\mathrm{Id}$ is the identity map on the tangent space. The eigenvalues of this operator are the principal curvatures of the sphere. In this case, every direction is a principal direction, and the corresponding principal curvature is $\\lambda = -1/R$.\n\nThe scalar mean curvature $H$ is defined as the trace of the shape operator, $H = \\text{tr}(S)$. The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues of the operator. Since the tangent space $T_pS^n_R$ has dimension $n$, the operator $S$ has $n$ eigenvalues, all of which are equal to $-1/R$. Alternatively, we can compute the trace by choosing an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_n\\}$ for $T_pS^n_R$. The trace is then:\n$$ H = \\text{tr}(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(S(e_i), e_i) $$\nwhere $g$ is the induced metric on the sphere. Substituting the expression for $S(e_i)$:\n$$ H = \\sum_{i=1}^n g\\left(-\\frac{1}{R}e_i, e_i\\right) = -\\frac{1}{R} \\sum_{i=1}^n g(e_i, e_i) $$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, we have $g(e_i, e_i) = 1$ for all $i = 1, \\ldots, n$. The sum becomes:\n$$ H = -\\frac{1}{R} \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 = -\\frac{n}{R} $$\nThe scalar mean curvature of the sphere $S^n_R$ is constant everywhere on the sphere and equals $-n/R$. The negative sign is a consequence of the convention used for the shape operator and the choice of the outward normal; it signifies that the sphere curves away from its normal vector.\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature vector $\\mathbf{H}$, which is defined as $\\mathbf{H} = H\\nu$. Using our calculated value for $H$:\n$$ \\mathbf{H} = \\left(-\\frac{n}{R}\\right) \\nu $$\nThis is the final expression for the mean curvature vector of the sphere $S^n_R$. It is a vector field normal to the sphere at every point. Its magnitude is constant, $\\|\\mathbf{H}\\| = |-n/R| \\|\\nu\\| = n/R$, and its direction is opposite to that of the outward-pointing normal $\\nu$. Thus, the mean curvature vector points radially inward toward the center of the sphere.

The evolution equation is $\\partial_{t}\\gamma = \\kappa\\,\\mathbf{n}$. This equation is geometric, meaning its form is independent of the parameterization of the curve and invariant under rigid motions (translations and rotations) of the ambient Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nLet the initial curve be $\\gamma_{0}$, a circle of radius $R_{0}$ centered at the origin. This curve is invariant under any rotation $Q \\in SO(2)$ about the origin, i.e., $Q(\\gamma_{0}) = \\gamma_{0}$. Because the flow equation is rotationally invariant, if $\\gamma(t)$ is the solution starting from $\\gamma_{0}$, then $Q(\\gamma(t))$ is the solution starting from $Q(\\gamma_{0})$. Since $Q(\\gamma_{0}) = \\gamma_{0}$, by uniqueness of solutions, we must have $Q(\\gamma(t)) = \\gamma(t)$ for all $t$ for which the smooth solution exists. A closed embedded curve in the plane that is invariant under all rotations about the origin must be a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, the evolving curve $\\gamma(t)$ must be a circle of some radius $R(t)$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nWe now derive the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the radius $R(t)$. We parameterize the circle of radius $R(t)$ at time $t$ by\n$$\n\\gamma(\\theta, t) = (R(t)\\cos\\theta, R(t)\\sin\\theta) = R(t)(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)\n$$\nfor the parameter $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe evolution law is $\\partial_{t}\\gamma = \\kappa\\,\\mathbf{n}$.

In the plane, the unit normal is obtained by rotating the unit tangent by $\\pm\\pi/2$. For a counter-clockwise parameterization, rotating $\\mathbf{T}$ by $+\\pi/2$ (counter-clockwise) yields the inward-pointing normal. A rotation by $+\\pi/2$ transforms a vector $(u,v)$ to $(-v,u)$.

At $t = R_{0}^{2}/2$, the radius becomes zero, and the circle shrinks to a point, where the curvature becomes infinite and the smooth solution ceases to exist.
