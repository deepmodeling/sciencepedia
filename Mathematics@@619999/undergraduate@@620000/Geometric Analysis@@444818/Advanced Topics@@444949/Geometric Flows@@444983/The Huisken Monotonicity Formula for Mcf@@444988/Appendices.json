It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution using established mathematical principles.\n\nThe task is to compute the integral of the backward heat kernel over a static $m$-dimensional plane $P \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. The integral is given by\n$$\nI = \\int_{P} \\Phi_{0,t_{0}}(x,t)\\,d\\mu\n$$\nwhere $P$ is an $m$-dimensional linear subspace, $d\\mu$ is the $m$-dimensional area measure on $P$, and the integrand is\n$$\n\\Phi_{0,t_{0}}(x,t) = \\bigl(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\bigr)^{-m/2}\\,\\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\frac{|x|^{2}}{4\\,(t_{0}-t)}\\Bigr)\n$$\nfor $t < t_0$. The problem states that $P$ is a static solution to the Mean Curvature Flow, which is consistent with $P$ being a linear subspace, as its mean curvature is identically zero.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we must first establish a convenient coordinate system on the subspace $P$. Since $P$ is an $m$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ passing through the origin, there exists an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_m\\}$ for $P$. Any vector $x \\in P$ can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of these basis vectors:\n$$\nx = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} u_i e_i\n$$\nwhere $u = (u_1, \\dots, u_m)$ are coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. This mapping from $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ to $x \\in P$ is a linear isometry.\n\nBecause the basis $\\{e_i\\}$ is orthonormal with respect to the standard inner product in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the squared Euclidean norm of $x$ is given by the sum of the squares of its coordinates in this basis:\n$$\n|x|^2 = \\langle x, x \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{m} u_i e_i, \\sum_{j=1}^{m} u_j e_j \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{m} u_i u_j \\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{m} u_i u_j \\delta_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} u_i^2 = |u|^2\n$$\nwhere $|u|^2$ is the standard squared Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}^m$.\n\nFurthermore, the $m$-dimensional area measure $d\\mu$ on the linear subspace $P$ corresponds to the standard Lebesgue measure $d^m u = du_1 du_2 \\dots du_m$ in the coordinate system defined by this orthonormal basis.\n\nUsing this parameterization, we can transform the integral over $P$ into an integral over $\\mathbb{R}^m$:\n$$\nI = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^m} \\bigl(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\bigr)^{-m/2}\\,\\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\frac{|u|^{2}}{4\\,(t_{0}-t)}\\Bigr)\\,d^m u\n$$\nLet's pull the constant factor outside the integral:\n$$\nI = \\bigl(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\bigr)^{-m/2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^m} \\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^m u_i^2}{4\\,(t_{0}-t)}\\Bigr)\\,d^m u\n$$\nThe exponential of a sum can be written as a product of exponentials.

The calculation is valid for any $t < t_0$. The time-dependent scaling factor $(t_0-t)^{-m/2}$ in the normalization of the heat kernel is precisely cancelled by the time-dependent term $(t_0-t)^{m/2}$ that arises from the scaling of the variables in the Gaussian integral itself. The result is a constant, $1$, for all $t < t_0$.

All terms are standard and the premises are consistent. We proceed with the solution, which is divided into two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Verification of the shrinker equation.\n\nThe problem asks to verify that the static plane $P$ passing through a point $x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ satisfies the self-shrinker equation for any parameter $\\tau > 0$. The shrinker equation is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} + \\frac{(x - x_{0})^{\\perp}}{2\\tau} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{H}$ is the mean curvature vector of the surface, $x$ is a point on the surface, and $(\\cdot)^{\\perp}$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the normal bundle of the surface at $x$.\n\nWe are given that $M_{t} = P$ is an $n$-dimensional affine plane for all $t < t_{0}$. It is a fundamental fact of differential geometry that an affine plane has zero curvature everywhere. Therefore, its mean curvature vector is identically zero:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} \\equiv 0\n$$\nNow we must analyze the second term, $\\frac{(x - x_{0})^{\\perp}}{2\\tau}$. Let $x$ be any point on the plane $P$. Since $P$ is an affine plane that contains the point $x_{0}$, the vector difference $v = x - x_{0}$ is a vector that lies entirely within the plane $P$. This means that for any $x \\in P$, the vector $x-x_0$ is a tangent vector to $P$.\n\nThe operator $(\\cdot)^{\\perp}$ projects a vector onto the normal bundle of $P$. The normal bundle is, by definition, orthogonal to the tangent space at every point. The projection of any tangent vector onto the normal bundle is therefore the zero vector. Since $x-x_0$ is a tangent vector, we have:\n$$\n(x - x_{0})^{\\perp} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these two results, $\\mathbf{H} = 0$ and $(x-x_{0})^{\\perp} = 0$, into the shrinker equation gives:\n$$\n0 + \\frac{0}{2\\tau} = 0\n$$\nThis equation is satisfied for any choice of $\\tau > 0$. This confirms that the static plane $P$ passing through $x_{0}$ is a self-shrinker for any parameter $\\tau > 0$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Gaussian density.\n\nThe Gaussian density of the flow $\\{M_{t}\\}$ at $(x_{0}, t_{0})$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Theta_{(x_{0},t_{0})} := \\lim_{t \\nearrow t_{0}} \\int_{M_{t}} \\Phi_{(x_{0},t_{0})}(x,t) \\, d\\mu_{t}(x)\n$$\nWe are given that the flow is static, $M_{t} = P$ for all $t < t_{0}$, and the measure $d\\mu_{t}$ is the standard $n$-dimensional area measure on $P$, denoted $dA_{P}$, multiplied by a constant integer multiplicity $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Thus, $d\\mu_{t}(x) = m \\, dA_{P}(x)$. The integral is independent of $t$ with respect to the domain of integration and the measure apart from the integrand itself.\n\nLet's substitute the given information into the definition:\n$$\n\\Theta_{(x_{0},t_{0})} = \\lim_{t \\nearrow t_{0}} \\int_{P} \\Big( \\big(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\big)^{-n/2} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{|x - x_{0}|^{2}}{4 (t_{0}-t)}\\Big) \\Big) m \\, dA_{P}(x)\n$$\nSince the multiplicity $m$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the limit and the integral:\n$$\n\\Theta_{(x_{0},t_{0})} = m \\lim_{t \\nearrow t_{0}} \\int_{P} \\big(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\big)^{-n/2} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{|x - x_{0}|^{2}}{4 (t_{0}-t)}\\Big) \\, dA_{P}(x)\n$$\nThe integral is over the $n$-dimensional plane $P$. The point $x_{0}$ lies in $P$. We can simplify the integral by choosing an appropriate coordinate system. Let $V$ be the $n$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $P = x_{0} + V$. Any point $x \\in P$ can be uniquely written as $x = x_{0} + y$ for some $y \\in V$. The space $V$ is isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The distance term becomes $|x - x_{0}|^{2} = |(x_{0} + y) - x_{0}|^{2} = |y|^{2}$. The area element $dA_{P}(x)$ becomes the standard $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure $d^{n}y$ on $V \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe integral transforms to:\n$$\nI(t) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\big(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\big)^{-n/2} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{|y|^{2}}{4 (t_{0}-t)}\\Big) \\, d^{n}y\n$$\nWe can pull the constant term (with respect to $y$) out of the integral:\n$$\nI(t) = \\big(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\big)^{-n/2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{|y|^{2}}{4 (t_{0}-t)}\\Big) \\, d^{n}y\n$$\nThe integral is a standard Gaussian integral in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Using the formula $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{k}} \\exp(-a|z|^{2}) d^{k}z = (\\pi/a)^{k/2}$, with $k=n$ and $a = \\frac{1}{4(t_{0}-t)}$, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{|y|^{2}}{4 (t_{0}-t)}\\Big) \\, d^{n}y = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{1/(4(t_{0}-t))} \\right)^{n/2} = \\big(4\\pi(t_{0}-t)\\big)^{n/2}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $I(t)$:\n$$\nI(t) = \\big(4\\pi (t_{0}-t)\\big)^{-n/2} \\cdot \\big(4\\pi(t_{0}-t)\\big)^{n/2} = 1\n$$\nThis shows that the value of the integral is $1$ for all $t < t_{0}$.
