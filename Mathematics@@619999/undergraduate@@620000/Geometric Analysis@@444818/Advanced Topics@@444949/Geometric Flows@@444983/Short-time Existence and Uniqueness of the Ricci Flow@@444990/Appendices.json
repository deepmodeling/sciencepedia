We are also asked to find the first singularity time $t_{\\ast}$ when $\\lambda > 0$. The derivation must be from first principles, using only the given definitions and the scaling properties of curvature.\n\nGiven the high degree of symmetry implied by the Einstein condition, we seek a solution of the form $g(t) = c(t)g_{0}$, where $c(t)$ is a time-dependent scaling function. For this to be a valid Riemannian metric, we must have $c(t) > 0$. The initial condition $g(0) = g_{0}$ implies $c(0)g_{0} = g_{0}$, which gives the initial condition for the scaling function: $c(0) = 1$.\n\nWe substitute this ansatz into the Ricci flow equation.

At any fixed time $t$, $g(t)$ is a constant multiple of $g_{0}$, i.e., $g(t) = k g_{0}$ where $k = c(t)$ is a constant with respect to the spatial coordinates. We now analyze how the Ricci tensor transforms under such a constant scaling of the metric. Let $\\tilde{g} = k g$ for a positive constant $k$.

Since the Christoffel symbols are invariant under scaling, the Riemann tensor of type $(1,3)$ is also invariant: $\\tilde{R}^{l}_{ijk} = R^{l}_{ijk}$.\n\nThe Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} = R^{i}_{jik}$.

Integrating with respect to $t$ gives $c(t) = -2\\lambda t + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration. Using the initial condition:\n$$\nc(0) = -2\\lambda(0) + C = 1 \\implies C = 1\n$$\nThus, the scaling function is $c(t) = 1 - 2\\lambda t$. The explicit expression for the evolving metric is:\n$$\ng(t) = (1 - 2\\lambda t) g_{0}\n$$\nThis solution is valid as long as $g(t)$ remains a Riemannian metric, which requires the scaling factor to be positive, i.e., $1 - 2\\lambda t > 0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the first singularity time $t_{\\ast}$ for the case where $\\lambda > 0$.
