The outward unit normal vector field is $\\nu(x) = \\frac{x}{R}$ for any point $x \\in M$.\n2.  The shape operator $S$ at a point $p \\in M$ is a linear map on the tangent space $T_p M$, defined by $S(v) = D_v \\nu$ for any tangent vector $v \\in T_p M$.

The directional derivative $D_v \\nu$ at the point $p$ is calculated by evaluating the action of the Jacobian of the vector field $\\nu$ on the vector $v$.\nThe vector field is $\\nu(x_1, \\dots, x_{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{R}(x_1, \\dots, x_{n+1})$.\nIts Jacobian matrix, $J_{\\nu}$, has entries $(J_{\\nu})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial \\nu_i}{\\partial x_j}$.\n$$ (J_{\\nu})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(\\frac{x_i}{R}\\right) = \\frac{1}{R} \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three main components: a justification for the preservation of spherical symmetry and convexity, the derivation of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the radius of the evolving sphere, and the calculation of the finite extinction time.\n\nFirst, we address the preservation of spherical symmetry. The initial condition is a round sphere $S^{n}(R_{0})$ centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. This hypersurface is invariant under the action of the orthogonal group $O(n+1)$, meaning that for any rotation or reflection $\\phi \\in O(n+1)$, we have $\\phi(S^{n}(R_{0})) = S^{n}(R_{0})$. The mean curvature flow equation, $\\partial_{t}F = -H\\nu$, is geometric in nature. This means its form is independent of the choice of parametrization and it is equivariant with respect to isometries of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. If $F(\\cdot, t)$ is a solution to the MCF with initial condition $F(\\cdot, 0)$, then for any $\\phi \\in O(n+1)$, $\\phi(F(\\cdot, t))$ is a solution to MCF with initial condition $\\phi(F(\\cdot, 0))$. Since the initial condition $S^{n}(R_{0})$ is invariant under $\\phi$, i.e., $\\phi(S^{n}(R_{0})) = S^{n}(R_{0})$, the uniqueness of solutions to this parabolic evolution equation implies that the solution at any later time $t$ must also be invariant under the action of $O(n+1)$. The only compact, connected, embedded hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are invariant under the full orthogonal group $O(n+1)$ are spheres centered at the origin. Therefore, the evolving hypersurface $F(\\Sigma^n, t)$ must be a sphere $S^{n}(R(t))$ for some radius function $R(t)$, with $R(0) = R_{0}$.\n\nNext, we address the preservation of strict convexity. A smooth hypersurface is strictly convex if all of its $n$ principal curvatures are strictly positive. For a sphere of radius $R(t)$ with the outward-pointing normal, the principal curvatures $\\kappa_{i}$ are all positive and equal, $\\kappa_{i}(t) = 1/R(t)$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n$. The initial sphere $S^{n}(R_{0})$ has $R_{0} > 0$, so its principal curvatures are all $1/R_{0} > 0$, making it strictly convex. Since the flow preserves the spherical shape, the surface at any time $t > 0$ for which a solution exists is $S^{n}(R(t))$. The surface remains strictly convex as long as $R(t) > 0$. The flow will cause the sphere to shrink, so $R(t)$ will decrease. Strict convexity is lost only at the moment the sphere collapses to a point, i.e., when $R(t)=0$. For any time $t$ before this extinction, $R(t)>0$, and the surface remains strictly convex. This argument is a simplification for the highly symmetric case of a sphere; for general convex surfaces, the preservation of convexity is a deeper result by Huisken, proven using the maximum principle for the evolution of the second fundamental form.\n\nNow, we derive the ODE for the radius $R(t)$. We can parameterize the evolving sphere $S^{n}(R(t))$ by $F(p, t) = R(t)p$, where $p$ is a point on the unit sphere $S^{n}(1) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The velocity vector of a point on the evolving surface is given by the partial derivative with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} = \\frac{d R(t)}{dt} p = \\dot{R}(t)p\n$$\nThe outward-pointing unit normal vector $\\nu$ at the point $F(p,t)$ is simply $p$. The MCF evolution equation is $\\partial_{t}F = -H\\nu$. Substituting our expressions for $\\partial_{t}F$ and $\\nu$ yields:\n$$\n\\dot{R}(t)p = -H(t)p\n$$\nThis vector equation implies the scalar ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = -H(t)\n$$\nTo complete this ODE, we need to express the mean curvature $H$ in terms of the radius $R$. The mean curvature is defined as the trace of the shape operator (or Weingarten map). For a sphere of radius $R$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the shape operator maps any tangent vector to itself scaled by $1/R$. Thus, in any orthonormal basis of the tangent space, the matrix of the shape operator is $(1/R)I$, where $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix are the principal curvatures, so $\\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2 = \\dots = \\kappa_n = 1/R$. The mean curvature $H$ is the sum of these principal curvatures:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\kappa_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{n}{R}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $H$ into our scalar ODE gives the evolution equation for the radius $R(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{n}{R(t)}\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the extinction time $T$. We must solve the ODE $\\frac{dR}{dt} = -n/R$ with the initial condition $R(0) = R_{0}$. This is a separable differential equation. We can write it as:\n$$\nR(t) \\frac{dR}{dt} = -n\n$$\nWe integrate both sides with respect to time from $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} R(\\tau) \\frac{dR}{d\\tau} d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} -n d\\tau\n$$\nThe left side can be evaluated by a change of variables to $R$.

Let $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_{n-1}\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p S^{n-1}$ of the unit sphere at point $p$. Tangent vectors to the cylinder at $F(p,z)$ can be formed by considering curves on the cylinder: let $\\gamma_i(s)$ be a curve on $S^{n-1}$ with $\\gamma_i(0)=p$ and $\\gamma_i'(0)=e_i$. Then, $C_i(s) = F(\\gamma_i(s), z) = (R\\gamma_i(s), z)$ are curves on the cylinder. The tangent vectors at $s=0$ are:\n$v_i = C_i'(0) = (R\\gamma_i'(0), 0) = (Re_i, 0)$ for $i=1, \\dots, n-1$.\nThe set $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_{n-1}, v_z\\}$ forms an orthogonal basis for the tangent space of the cylinder at $F(p,z)$.\n\nNext, we identify the inward-pointing unit normal vector $\\nu$. A vector normal to the cylinder at $(Rp, z)$ must be orthogonal to all tangent vectors. Consider the vector $\\nu' = (-p, 0)$.\nWe check for orthogonality:\n$\\nu' \\cdot v_z = (-p, 0) \\cdot (0, \\dots, 0, 1) = 0$.\n$\\nu' \\cdot v_i = (-p, 0) \\cdot (Re_i, 0) = -R(p \\cdot e_i) = 0$, because $e_i \\in T_p S^{n-1}$ is orthogonal to the radial vector $p$.\nThe magnitude is $\\|\\nu'\\| = \\sqrt{(-p)\\cdot(-p)} = \\|p\\| = 1$, since $p \\in S^{n-1}$. The vector $(-p, 0)$ points from the surface towards the central $z$-axis, so it is the inward-pointing unit normal.

In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the covariant derivative $D_v \\nu$ is the standard directional derivative of the vector field $\\nu$ in the direction $v$.\nLet's compute the action of $S$ on our basis vectors.\nFor the axial direction $v_z$:\n$S(v_z) = -D_{v_z} \\nu = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-p, 0) = 0$.\nThe vector field $\\nu$ is constant in the $z$-direction.
