Derive $H$ from these definitions and present your final answer as a closed-form expression in terms of $n$ and $R$. No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the mean curvature scalar $H$ of the sphere $S^{n}(R)$ embedded in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The calculation must strictly follow the provided definitions. The sphere $S^{n}(R)$ is the hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ defined as the set of points $p$ such that $\\langle p, p \\rangle = R^2$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the standard Euclidean inner product and $R > 0$ is the radius.\n\nThe first step is to identify the outward-pointing unit normal field $\\nu$. For any point $p \\in S^{n}(R)$, the position vector $p$ is orthogonal to the tangent space $T_p S^{n}(R)$. This is because for any curve $\\gamma(t)$ on the sphere with $\\gamma(0) = p$, we have $\\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = R^2$. Differentiating with respect to $t$ at $t=0$ gives $2 \\langle \\gamma'(0), \\gamma(0) \\rangle = 0$, which means $2 \\langle X, p \\rangle = 0$ for any tangent vector $X = \\gamma'(0) \\in T_p S^{n}(R)$. Thus, the position vector $p$ is normal to the sphere at point $p$. The outward direction is given by $p$ itself. To obtain a unit normal vector, we must normalize the position vector $p$. The length of $p$ is $\\|p\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle p, p \\rangle} = \\sqrt{R^2} = R$. Therefore, the outward-pointing unit normal field $\\nu$ at a point $p \\in S^{n}(R)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\nu(p) = \\frac{p}{R}\n$$\n\nNext, we must compute the second fundamental form $A$, which is defined by $A(X,Y) = \\langle D_{X} \\nu, Y \\rangle$ for tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p S^{n}(R)$. Here, $D$ is the Levi-Civita connection on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which is simply the standard directional derivative of vector fields. To compute $D_X \\nu$, we can extend the tangent vector $X \\in T_p S^{n}(R)$ to a vector field $\\tilde{X}$ in a neighborhood of $p$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Then $D_X \\nu$ is the derivative of the vector field $\\nu$ in the direction of $X$. We can view $\\nu$ as a vector field defined in a neighborhood of the sphere. Let's consider the position vector field, which we can denote by $Id$, such that $Id(p)=p$. Then $\\nu = \\frac{1}{R} Id$. The directional derivative of the position vector field $Id$ along any vector $X$ is the vector $X$ itself, i.e., $D_X Id = X$. This is a fundamental property of the Euclidean connection. Using the linearity of the connection, we have:\n$$\nD_X \\nu = D_X \\left(\\frac{1}{R} Id\\right) = \\frac{1}{R} D_X Id = \\frac{1}{R} X\n$$\nThis vector, $\\frac{1}{R}X$, is often denoted as the result of the Weingarten map (or shape operator) acting on $X$.\n\nNow we can write the second fundamental form $A$ at the point $p$:\n$$\nA_p(X,Y) = \\langle D_X \\nu, Y \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{R} X, Y \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. When restricted to vectors tangent to the sphere, such as $X$ and $Y$, this inner product is precisely the induced Riemannian metric $g$ on $S^{n}(R)$. So, we can write:\n$$\nA_p(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{R} \\langle X, Y \\rangle = \\frac{1}{R} g_p(X,Y)\n$$\nThis shows that the second fundamental form is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor.\n\nThe final step is to compute the mean curvature scalar $H$, which the problem defines as the metric trace of $A$, i.e., $H = \\operatorname{tr}_{g} A$. To compute this trace, we choose an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n\\}$ for the tangent space $T_p S^{n}(R)$ with respect to the induced metric $g_p$. By definition, $g_p(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The trace is the sum of the diagonal components of the second fundamental form in this basis:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_p(e_i, e_i)\n$$\nUsing our expression for $A_p$, we have:\n$$\nA_p(e_i, e_i) = \\frac{1}{R} g_p(e_i, e_i)\n$$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g_p(e_i, e_i) = 1$ for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.

The initial condition is a circle $C(0)$ of radius $R_{0} > 0$.\n\n### Part 1: Evolution of the Radius\n\nFirst, we derive an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the radius $R(t)$ of the evolving circle. A circle of radius $R(t)$ centered at the origin can be parametrized by $X(\\theta, t) = R(t)(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe velocity of a point on the curve is the partial derivative of $X$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\partial_{t} X = \\frac{dR}{dt}(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta) $$\nThe vector $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ is the outward-pointing unit normal to the circle.

The rate of change of the area of a region $D(t)$ whose boundary $C(t)$ moves with velocity field $\\vec{v}$ is given by the formula (a consequence of the Reynolds transport theorem):\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\int_{C(t)} \\vec{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}} \\, ds $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal and $ds$ is the arc length element.\n\nIn our problem, the velocity of the boundary is given by $\\vec{v} = \\partial_{t} X = \\kappa \\, \\mathbf{n}$. The normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is specified as the inward-pointing normal. The relationship between the inward and outward normals is $\\mathbf{n} = -\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}}$.\nSubstituting the velocity into the area evolution formula:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\int_{C(t)} (\\kappa \\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}} \\, ds = \\int_{C(t)} \\kappa (-\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}} \\, ds $$\nSince $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}}$ is a unit vector, $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{out}} = 1$. This simplifies the expression to:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = -\\int_{C(t)} \\kappa \\, ds $$\nFor any simple closed curve in the plane, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of the curvature over the curve is always $2\\pi$:\n$$ \\int_{C(t)} \\kappa \\, ds = 2\\pi $$\nThis holds for our evolving convex curve at any time $t$ before extinction. Therefore, the rate of change of area is constant:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = -2\\pi $$\nWe integrate this simple ODE with respect to time from $t=0$ to $t$:\n$$ A(t) - A(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} (-2\\pi) \\, d\\tau = -2\\pi t $$\nThe initial area $A(0)$ is the area of a circle with radius $R_{0}$, which is $A(0) = \\pi R_{0}^{2}$.
