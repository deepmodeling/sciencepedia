It is a standard application of comparison theorems in Riemannian geometry, specifically the Toponogov comparison theorem, and all necessary conditions and data are provided for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a sharp lower bound on the angle at vertex $p$ of a geodesic triangle $\\triangle(pqr)$ in a complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with sectional curvature $K \\geq 4$. The triangle is equilateral, with side lengths $d(p,q) = d(p,r) = d(q,r) = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. The geodesic segments forming the sides are minimizing.\n\nThe primary tool for this problem is the Toponogov Comparison Theorem. Let $(M,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $K \\geq H$ for some constant $H$. Let $S^2_H$ be the model space of constant curvature $H$, which is a sphere of radius $R = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{H}}$ if $H > 0$, the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ if $H=0$, or the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$ of curvature $H$ if $H  0$. Consider a geodesic triangle $\\triangle(pqr)$ in $M$. A comparison triangle $\\tilde{\\triangle}(\\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r})$ is a geodesic triangle in $S^2_H$ with the same side lengths, i.e., $d_{S^2_H}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{q}) = d_M(p,q)$, $d_{S^2_H}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{r}) = d_M(p,r)$, and $d_{S^2_H}(\\tilde{q},\\tilde{r}) = d_M(q,r)$. Such a triangle exists in $S^2_H$ if the sum of its side lengths is less than $2\\pi R$ (the circumference of a great circle) when $H > 0$. The Toponogov theorem states that the angles of $\\triangle(pqr)$ are greater than or equal to the corresponding angles of $\\tilde{\\triangle}(\\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r})$. That is, the angle at $p$, $\\alpha_p$, satisfies $\\alpha_p \\geq \\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}$, where $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}$ is the angle at vertex $\\tilde{p}$ in the comparison triangle.\n\nIn this problem, the sectional curvature is bounded below by $H=4$. Since $H > 0$, the model space is a sphere $S^2_4$ of constant curvature $4$. The radius of this sphere is $R = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{H}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe given geodesic triangle $\\triangle(pqr)$ has side lengths $L = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. A comparison triangle $\\tilde{\\triangle}(\\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r})$ in $S^2_4$ must have the same side lengths: $d_{S^2_4}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{q}) = d_{S^2_4}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{r}) = d_{S^2_4}(\\tilde{q},\\tilde{r}) = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. The perimeter of this triangle is $3 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The circumference of a great circle on $S^2_4$ is $2\\pi R = 2\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\pi$. Since $\\frac{\\pi}{2}  \\pi$, such a triangle exists. Also, the condition for applying Toponogov's theorem, which requires that the lengths of any two sides of the triangle sum to less than $\\pi R$ for the angle between them to be compared, is satisfied as $\\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}  \\pi R = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nBy the Toponogov theorem, the angle $\\alpha_p$ at vertex $p$ in the manifold $M$ is bounded below by the angle $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}$ at the corresponding vertex $\\tilde{p}$ of the comparison triangle in $S^2_4$. To find this lower bound, we must compute $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}$.\n\nWe use the spherical law of cosines for a geodesic triangle on a sphere of radius $R$. For a triangle with side lengths $a, b, c$, the angle $C$ opposite side $c$ is given by:\n$$ \\cos\\left(\\frac{c}{R}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{a}{R}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{b}{R}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{a}{R}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{b}{R}\\right)\\cos(C) $$\nFor our comparison triangle $\\tilde{\\triangle}(\\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r})$, we want to find the angle $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}$ at vertex $\\tilde{p}$. The side opposite this vertex is $\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r}$, with length $c = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. The adjacent sides are $\\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}$ and $\\tilde{p}\\tilde{r}$, with lengths $a=b=\\frac{\\pi}{6}$. The radius of the sphere is $R = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe lengths of the sides scaled by the radius are:\n$$ \\frac{a}{R} = \\frac{b}{R} = \\frac{c}{R} = \\frac{\\pi/6}{1/2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} $$\nSubstituting these values into the spherical law of cosines:\n$$ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}) $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}) $$\nWe know the values $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Substituting these:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 \\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}\\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}) $$\nNow, we solve for $\\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}})$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}) $$\n$$ \\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}) = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThus, the angle in the comparison triangle is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\nAccording to the Toponogov comparison theorem, $\\alpha_p \\geq \\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\tilde{p}}$, so $\\alpha_p \\geq \\arccos(\\frac{1}{3})$. This lower bound is sharp because it is attained in the model space $S^2_4$ itself, which is a manifold satisfying the condition $K \\geq 4$ (in fact, $K=4$ everywhere).

Proceeding with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the hypotheses of the Toponogov comparison theorem. As stated in the problem, a critical hypothesis is that the three sides of the \"geodesic triangle\" must be **minimizing geodesic segments** connecting the vertices. We must check if each of the three specified sides of the figure $(A,B,C)$ meets this condition.\n\nThe vertices are $A=(1,0,0)$, $B=(\\cos(10\\pi/9),\\sin(10\\pi/9),0)$, and $C=(0,0,1)$. The Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$ between two points $p, q$ on the unit sphere is the angle between their position vectors, i.e., $d(p,q) = \\arccos(p \\cdot q)$. A geodesic segment between $p$ and $q$ is minimizing if and only if its length is equal to $d(p,q)$.\n\n1.  **Side AC**: The specified side is the meridian from $A$ to $C$, with length $l(AC) = \\pi/2$. The distance is $d(A,C) = \\arccos(A \\cdot C) = \\arccos((1,0,0) \\cdot (0,0,1)) = \\arccos(0) = \\pi/2$. Since $l(AC) = d(A,C)$, this side is a minimizing geodesic segment.\n\n2.  **Side BC**: The specified side is the meridian from $B$ to $C$, with length $l(BC) = \\pi/2$. The distance is $d(B,C) = \\arccos(B \\cdot C) = \\arccos((\\cos(10\\pi/9),\\sin(10\\pi/9),0) \\cdot (0,0,1)) = \\arccos(0) = \\pi/2$. Since $l(BC) = d(B,C)$, this side is also a minimizing geodesic segment.\n\n3.  **Side AB**: The specified side is the longer equatorial arc from $A$ to $B$, with length $l(AB) = 10\\pi/9$. The problem states that the Riemannian distance is the shorter arc length, $d(A,B) = 8\\pi/9$. Since $l(AB) = 10\\pi/9 > d(A,B) = 8\\pi/9$, this side is **not** a minimizing geodesic segment.\n    Furthermore, on the unit sphere, a geodesic segment is minimizing only if its length is less than or equal to $\\pi$. Here, $l(AB) = 10\\pi/9 > \\pi$. This also confirms it is not a minimizing geodesic.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since the side $AB$ is not a minimizing geodesic segment, the figure described does not form a geodesic triangle in the sense required by the Toponogov comparison theorem. Therefore, the theorem cannot be applied to this configuration.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The chosen side $AB$ crosses the cut locus of $A$ at $A'$, is not distance-minimizing between $A$ and $B$, and therefore the triangle $(A,B,C)$ does not meet the hypotheses of the Toponogov comparison theorem; in particular, the theorem cannot be applied to comparisons that use the chosen side $AB$.**\nThe cut locus of $A=(1,0,0)$ is its antipode, $A'=(-1,0,0)$. The geodesic path from $A$ along the equator reaches $A'$ after an arc length of $\\pi$. The chosen side $AB$ is an arc of length $10\\pi/9$. Since $10\\pi/9 > \\pi$, this arc must pass through $A'$. A geodesic segment that reaches or crosses the cut locus of its starting point is no longer minimizing. As established above, the side $AB$ is not distance-minimizing. Because one of its sides is not a minimizing geodesic, the figure does not satisfy the hypotheses of the Toponogov comparison theorem. This statement accurately describes the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The Toponogov comparison theorem applies as long as each side is a geodesic, regardless of whether it is minimizing; hence it applies to the above triangle.**\nThis statement is a direct contradiction of a fundamental requirement of the Toponogov theorem. The theorem is a statement about geodesic triangles, which, by standard definition in this context, are formed by minimizing geodesic segments. The problem statement itself correctly notes this requirement. The minimizing condition is crucial to prevent ambiguity and ensure the \"triangle\" is well-behaved.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If one replaces the chosen side $AB$ by the shorter equatorial arc of length $8\\pi/9$ (the distance $d(A,B)$), then all three sides are minimizing geodesic segments and the hypotheses of the Toponogov comparison theorem are satisfied.**\nLet's consider this modified triangle. The new side $AB$ has length $8\\pi/9$. This is equal to the distance $d(A,B)$, so it is a minimizing geodesic segment. The other two sides, $AC$ and $BC$, with lengths $\\pi/2$, were already shown to be minimizing. With this change, all three sides of the triangle $(A,B,C)$ would be minimizing geodesic segments. Therefore, this new triangle would satisfy the hypotheses of the Toponogov comparison theorem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. On $S^{2}$, any geodesic triangle whose perimeter is less than $3\\pi$ automatically satisfies the minimizing condition on each side, so the Toponogov comparison theorem applies regardless of which geodesic arcs are chosen between vertices.**\nThis statement proposes a general rule that is false. The original figure provides a direct counterexample. Its perimeter is $P = l(AC) + l(BC) + l(AB) = \\pi/2 + \\pi/2 + 10\\pi/9 = \\pi + 10\\pi/9 = 19\\pi/9$. Since $19\\pi/9 \\approx 2.11\\pi$, we have $P  3\\pi$. However, as we have definitively shown, the side $AB$ of length $10\\pi/9$ is not minimizing. The choice of geodesic arc is critical; one cannot choose an arc of length greater than $\\pi$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The failure of the Toponogov comparison theorem in the above configuration occurs because the angle at $A$ is not well-defined when the side $AB$ crosses the cut locus of $A$; consequently, the figure is not a valid geodesic triangle.**\nThe angle at a vertex is the angle between the tangent vectors of the outgoing geodesics. The geodesic $AC$ is a meridian, and at $A=(1,0,0)$ its tangent vector is proportional to $(0,0,1)$. The geodesic $AB$ lies on the equator; its initial tangent vector at $A=(1,0,0)$ is proportional to $(0, \\pm 1, 0)$ depending on direction. These two vectors are orthogonal, so the angle at $A$ is well-defined and equal to $\\pi/2$. The concept of an angle is local; it depends only on the initial directions of the geodesic segments. The fact that one segment later crosses a cut locus does not make the initial angle undefined. The reason for the inapplicability of the theorem is the failure of a global property (the side is not minimizing), not the failure of a local property (the angle is ill-defined).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A, C}$$", "id": "3075685"}]}
