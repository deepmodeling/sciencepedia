We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the geometry of space forms through geodesic polar coordinates. The scale factor for the metric on geodesic spheres is governed by the function $S_k(r)$, which is the unique solution to the Jacobi equation $y'' + ky = 0$ with initial conditions appropriate for parametrizing distances from a point.\n\nFirst, we solve for $S_k(r)$ for each value of $k \\in \\{0, +1, -1\\}$. The differential equation is $S_k''(r) + k S_k(r) = 0$, with initial conditions $S_k(0) = 0$ and $S_k'(0) = 1$.\n\nCase $k=0$ (Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$):\nThe equation is $S_0''(r) = 0$. The general solution is $S_0(r) = Ar + B$.\nApplying the initial conditions:\n$S_0(0) = B = 0$.\n$S_0'(r) = A$, so $S_0'(0) = A = 1$.\nThus, for $k=0$, we have $S_0(r) = r$.\n\nCase $k=+1$ (Sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$):\nThe equation is $S_{+1}''(r) + S_{+1}(r) = 0$. The general solution is $S_{+1}(r) = A \\cos(r) + B \\sin(r)$.\nApplying the initial conditions:\n$S_{+1}(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A = 0$.\n$S_{+1}'(r) = -A \\sin(r) + B \\cos(r)$. With $A=0$, this is $S_{+1}'(r) = B \\cos(r)$.\n$S_{+1}'(0) = B \\cos(0) = B = 1$.\nThus, for $k=+1$, we have $S_{+1}(r) = \\sin(r)$.\n\nCase $k=-1$ (Hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^n$):\nThe equation is $S_{-1}''(r) - S_{-1}(r) = 0$. The general solution is $S_{-1}(r) = A \\cosh(r) + B \\sinh(r)$.\nApplying the initial conditions:\n$S_{-1}(0) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A = 0$.\n$S_{-1}'(r) = A \\sinh(r) + B \\cosh(r)$.

In a space of constant sectional curvature $k$, the metric takes the form:\n$$ ds^2 = dr^2 + S_k(r)^2 d\\sigma_{n-1}^2 $$\nwhere $d\\sigma_{n-1}^2$ is the metric on the unit $(n-1)$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$.

The induced metric on $\\partial B_p(r)$ is $S_k(r)^2 d\\sigma_{n-1}^2$, so its volume form is $S_k(r)^{n-1} d\\Omega_{n-1}$.\n$$ \\operatorname{Area}(\\partial B_p(r)) = \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} S_k(r)^{n-1} \\, d\\Omega_{n-1} = S_k(r)^{n-1} \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} d\\Omega_{n-1} $$\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} d\\Omega_{n-1}$ is the area of the unit $(n-1)$-sphere, denoted by $\\omega_{n-1}$. Therefore,\n$$ \\operatorname{Area}(\\partial B_p(r)) = \\omega_{n-1} S_k(r)^{n-1} $$\nThis expression is precisely the definition of the comparison area function $A_k^{(n)}(r)$.\n\nThe $n$-dimensional volume of the geodesic ball $B_p(r)$ is found by integrating the volume element $dV_g$ over the ball.

We now substitute our explicit forms of $S_k(r)$ to find the functions for each space.\n\nFor $k=0$ ($\\mathbb{R}^n$): $S_0(r) = r$.\n$A_0^{(n)}(r) = \\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1}$.\n$V_0^{(n)}(r) = \\omega_{n-1} \\int_0^r t^{n-1} \\, dt = \\omega_{n-1} \\left[ \\frac{t^n}{n} \\right]_0^r = \\frac{\\omega_{n-1} r^n}{n}$.\n\nFor $k=+1$ ($\\mathbb{S}^n$): $S_{+1}(r) = \\sin(r)$.\n$A_{+1}^{(n)}(r) = \\omega_{n-1} \\sin^{n-1}(r)$.\n$V_{+1}^{(n)}(r) = \\omega_{n-1} \\int_0^r \\sin^{n-1}(t) \\, dt$. This integral is left in this form as it generally does not have a simpler elementary representation.\n\nFor $k=-1$ ($\\mathbb{H}^n$): $S_{-1}(r) = \\sinh(r)$.\n$A_{-1}^{(n)}(r) = \\omega_{n-1} \\sinh^{n-1}(r)$.\n$V_{-1}^{(n)}(r) = \\omega_{n-1} \\int_0^r \\sinh^{n-1}(t) \\, dt$.
