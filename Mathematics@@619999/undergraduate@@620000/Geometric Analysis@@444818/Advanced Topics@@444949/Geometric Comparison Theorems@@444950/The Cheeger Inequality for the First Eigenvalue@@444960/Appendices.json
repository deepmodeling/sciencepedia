We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe total area of the torus is $\\mathrm{area}(T^{2}) = L \\times L = L^{2}$. The definition of the Cheeger constant $h(T^{2})$ involves finding the infimum of the ratio of a region's boundary length to its area. Due to the $\\min$ function in the denominator, one can restrict the search to regions $\\Omega$ with $\\mathrm{area}(\\Omega) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{area}(T^{2})$, for which the definition simplifies to:\n$$\nh(T^{2}) = \\inf_{0  \\mathrm{area}(\\Omega) \\leq L^{2}/2} \\frac{\\mathrm{length}(\\partial \\Omega)}{\\mathrm{area}(\\Omega)}\n$$\n\nTo determine $h(T^{2})$, we must solve the isoperimetric problem on the square torus. It is a known result that for a given area $A$, the region with the minimum boundary length is either a Euclidean disk or a straight band wrapping around the torus.\n\n1.  A Euclidean disk of area $A$ has a radius $r = \\sqrt{A/\\pi}$. Its perimeter (length of boundary) is $P_{\\text{disk}}(A) = 2\\pi r = 2\\sqrt{\\pi A}$. This shape is valid as long as the disk does not self-intersect on the torus, i.e., for radius $r \\leq L/2$, which corresponds to an area $A \\leq \\pi (L/2)^{2} = \\pi L^{2}/4$.\n2.  A straight band of width $w$ wrapping around the torus once has an area $A = wL$. Its boundary consists of two disjoint closed geodesics, each of length $L$. Thus, its total boundary length is $P_{\\text{band}}(A) = 2L$, independent of its area $A$.\n\nFor a fixed area $A$, we compare the perimeters. The band is a better minimizer than the disk if $P_{\\text{band}}(A)  P_{\\text{disk}}(A)$, which means $2L  2\\sqrt{\\pi A}$, or $L^{2}  \\pi A$, or $A  L^{2}/\\pi$. Since $\\pi  2$, we have $L^{2}/\\pi  L^{2}/2$. The domain of areas we consider is $(0, L^{2}/2]$. The crossover point $A = L^{2}/\\pi$ is within this domain.\nLet $I(A)$ be the isoperimetric ratio for the minimizing shape of area $A$.\n- For $0  A \\leq L^{2}/\\pi$, the minimizer is a disk, and the ratio is $I(A) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi A}}{A} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{A}}$.\n- For $L^{2}/\\pi  A \\leq L^{2}/2$, the minimizer is a band, and the ratio is $I(A) = \\frac{2L}{A}$.\n\nThe function $I(A)$ is strictly decreasing with respect to $A$ over the entire interval $(0, L^{2}/2]$. Therefore, the infimum is attained at the maximum possible area, $A = L^{2}/2$. At this area, $L^{2}/2  L^{2}/\\pi$, so the minimizing shape is a band. The corresponding ratio is:\n$$\nh(T^{2}) = I(L^{2}/2) = \\frac{2L}{L^{2}/2} = \\frac{4}{L}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the lower bound on $\\lambda_{1}$ using Cheeger's inequality, which states $\\lambda_{1} \\ge \\frac{h(M)^{2}}{4}$ for any compact Riemannian manifold $M$. For our torus $T^{2}$:\n$$\n\\text{Cheeger lower bound for }\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{h(T^{2})^{2}}{4} = \\frac{(4/L)^{2}}{4} = \\frac{16/L^{2}}{4} = \\frac{4}{L^{2}}\n$$\n\nNow, we calculate the exact value of $\\lambda_{1}$. The Laplace-Beltrami operator on the flat torus $T^{2}$ is the standard Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta = -(\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial y^{2}})$, with periodic boundary conditions on the square domain $[0,L] \\times [0,L]$.

The first nonzero eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{1}$, corresponds to the smallest nonzero value of the integer sum $k^{2}+m^{2}$. This minimum value is $1$, achieved when $(|k|, |m|)$ is $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$.\nSubstituting $k^{2}+m^{2}=1$ into the eigenvalue formula gives the exact value of $\\lambda_{1}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,\\mathrm{exact}} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}(1) = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required dimensionless comparison factor $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\lambda_{1,\\mathrm{exact}}}{\\text{Cheeger lower bound for }\\lambda_{1}} = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}/L^{2}}{4/L^{2}}\n$$\nThe factors of $4$ and $L^{2}$ cancel, yielding the final result.\n$$\nR = \\pi^{2}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi^{2}}$$", "id": "2970855"}, {"introduction": "While finding the Cheeger constant often involves estimation, this exercise introduces a powerful method for its exact determination on a planar annulus.

The divergence of this vector field in polar coordinates is given by $\\nabla \\cdot X = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d}{d\\rho}(\\rho f(\\rho)) = f'(\\rho) + \\frac{f(\\rho)}{\\rho}$.\nWe require $\\nabla \\cdot X = c$ for some positive constant $c$.

Multiplying by the integrating factor $\\rho$, we get $\\rho f'(\\rho) + f(\\rho) = c\\rho$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{d}{d\\rho}(\\rho f(\\rho)) = c\\rho$.\nIntegrating with respect to $\\rho$ gives $\\rho f(\\rho) = \\frac{c\\rho^2}{2} + K$, where $K$ is an integration constant.\nThus, the general solution for $f(\\rho)$ is $f(\\rho) = \\frac{c\\rho}{2} + \\frac{K}{\\rho}$.\n\nThis vector field must also satisfy the condition $|X(x)| \\le 1$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$, which translates to $|f(\\rho)| \\le 1$ for all $\\rho \\in (r, R)$.

Let's set $f(r) = -1$ and $f(R) = 1$. This yields a system of two linear equations for $c$ and $K$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{cr}{2} + \\frac{K}{r} = -1 \\\\\n\\frac{cR}{2} + \\frac{K}{R} = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $K = r(-1 - \\frac{cr}{2})$.

This means $f(\\rho)$ is strictly increasing on $[r,R]$.\nThe minimum value is $f(r)=-1$ and the maximum value is $f(R)=1$.

For $a \\geq b$, consider the set $S \\subset \\Omega_{a,b}$ obtained by taking the central horizontal segment of length $a-b$ along the midline and taking its Minkowski sum with the closed disk of radius $b/2$. Equivalently, $S$ is the rectangle of dimensions $(a-b) \\times b$ with the two short sides replaced by semicircles of radius $b/2$. This shape is contained in $\\Omega_{a,b}$ because the rounding radius is $b/2$, the half-width of the strip.\n\nThe perimeter and area of $S$ are readily computed by elementary geometry. The boundary consists of two straight segments of length $a-b$ and two semicircles of radius $b/2$, so\n$$\nP(S) \\;=\\; 2(a-b) + \\pi b \\;=\\; 2a + (\\pi - 2)\\,b.\n$$\nThe area equals the area of the $(a-b)\\times b$ rectangle plus the area of a full disk of radius $b/2$,\n$$\n|S| \\;=\\; b(a-b) \\;+\\; \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\,b^{2} \\;=\\; ab - \\Big(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\Big)b^{2}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nh(\\Omega_{a,b}) \\;\\leq\\; \\frac{P(S)}{|S|} \\;=\\; \\frac{2a + (\\pi - 2)\\,b}{ab - \\big(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\big)b^{2}}.\n$$\nFor fixed $b0$ and $a \\to \\infty$, a straightforward expansion yields\n$$\n\\frac{P(S)}{|S|} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{b} \\,\\frac{1 + \\frac{\\pi - 2}{2}\\,\\frac{b}{a}}{1 - \\big(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\big)\\frac{b}{a}}\n\\;=\\; \\frac{2}{b}\\left[1 + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\,\\frac{b}{a} + \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\right]\n\\;=\\; \\frac{2}{b} + \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right).\n$$\nCombining with the lower bound from Step 1,\n$$\nh(\\Omega_{a,b}) \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{b} + \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right) \\quad \\text{as } \\frac{a}{b} \\to \\infty.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Asymptotics of the discrepancy and evaluation of the limit.
