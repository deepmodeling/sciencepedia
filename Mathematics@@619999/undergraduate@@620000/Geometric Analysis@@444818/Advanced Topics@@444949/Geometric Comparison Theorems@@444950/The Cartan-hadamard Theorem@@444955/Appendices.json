We will invoke the definition of a Cartan-Hadamard manifold: a connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature.\n\nFirst, let's examine the conditions for being a Cartan-Hadamard manifold.\n\n1.  **Connected and Simply Connected**: The underlying manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is known to be both connected and simply connected.\n\n2.  **Completeness**: The metric coefficients are smooth functions defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and do not degenerate. Specifically, $g_{xx}=1$ and $g_{yy}=(x^2+c^2)^2$ are always positive since $c>0$.

This immediately shows that statement (A) is false.\n\n3.  **Sectional Curvature**: For a two-dimensional manifold, the sectional curvature is the Gaussian curvature $K$. The given metric is orthogonal, of the form $ds^2 = E(x,y)dx^2 + G(x,y)dy^2$, where $E(x,y) = 1$ and $G(x,y) = (x^2+c^2)^2$. The formula for the Gaussian curvature in this case is:\n    $$K = -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{EG}} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{G_x}{\\sqrt{EG}}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{E_y}{\\sqrt{EG}}\\right) \\right]$$\n    Let's compute the necessary components.\n    - $E = 1$, so its partial derivative with respect to $y$, $E_y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(1) = 0$.\n    - $G = (x^2+c^2)^2$, so its partial derivative with respect to $x$ is $G_x = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}((x^2+c^2)^2) = 2(x^2+c^2)(2x) = 4x(x^2+c^2)$.\n    - The term $\\sqrt{EG}$ is $\\sqrt{1 \\cdot (x^2+c^2)^2} = |x^2+c^2|$. Since $c$ is a positive real constant and $x$ is real, $x^2 \\ge 0$, so $x^2+c^2$ is always positive. Thus, $\\sqrt{EG} = x^2+c^2$.\n\n    Now we substitute these into the curvature formula. The term involving $E_y$ vanishes.\n    $$K = -\\frac{1}{2(x^2+c^2)} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{4x(x^2+c^2)}{x^2+c^2}\\right) \\right]$$\n    $$K = -\\frac{1}{2(x^2+c^2)} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(4x) \\right]$$\n    $$K = -\\frac{1}{2(x^2+c^2)} [4]$$\n    $$K = -\\frac{2}{x^2+c^2}$$\n    Since $c$ is a positive real constant, $c^2 > 0$.
