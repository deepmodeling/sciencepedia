This calculation underlies the hypothesis appearing in Myers' theorem on diameter bounds, which assumes a uniform positive lower bound on Ricci curvature. Starting only from the following standard definitions:\n- The Riemann curvature tensor $R$ acting on vectors is defined by $R(X,Y)Z=\\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z-\\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z-\\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$, where $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection.\n- For a $2$-plane $\\sigma\\subset T_{p}S^{n}$ spanned by linearly independent vectors $u,v$, the sectional curvature is $K(\\sigma)=\\dfrac{\\langle R(u,v)v,u\\rangle}{\\|u\\wedge v\\|^{2}}$, and when $\\{u,v\\}$ is orthonormal this reduces to $K(\\sigma)=\\langle R(u,v)v,u\\rangle$.\n- The Ricci curvature is the trace over the first and fourth slots of $R$, namely $\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\langle R(e_{i},X)Y,e_{i}\\rangle$ for any local orthonormal frame $\\{e_{1},\\dots,e_{n}\\}$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and the assumption that every sectional curvature equals the same constant $k$, compute the Ricci curvature tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$ of $\\left(S^{n},g\\right)$ and express your final result as a tensorial expression in terms of $n$, $k$, and $g$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in differential geometry. All provided definitions are standard and the setup is self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Ricci curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, for an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ that has constant sectional curvature $k > 0$. The result should be expressed in terms of the dimension $n$, the curvature constant $k$, and the metric tensor $g$.\n\nThe fundamental assumption is that for any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p M$ at any point $p \\in M$, the sectional curvature is $K(\\sigma) = k$. It is a standard result in Riemannian geometry that a manifold has constant sectional curvature $k$ if and only if its Riemann curvature tensor $R$ has the form:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = k(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)\n$$\nfor any vector fields $X, Y, Z$. Here, $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the inner product defined by the metric tensor $g$; i.e., $\\langle X,Y \\rangle = g(X,Y)$. We will use this form of the Riemann tensor, as it is the direct consequence of the problem's primary assumption.\n\nThe definition of the Ricci curvature tensor provided is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\langle R(e_{i},X)Y,e_{i}\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ is any local orthonormal frame for the tangent space $T_p M$.\n\nWe proceed by substituting the expression for the Riemann tensor $R$ into the definition of the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two arbitrary vector fields.\n$$\nR(e_i, X)Y = k(\\langle X,Y \\rangle e_i - \\langle e_i, Y \\rangle X)\n$$\nNext, we take the inner product of this expression with the basis vector $e_i$:\n$$\n\\langle R(e_i, X)Y, e_i \\rangle = \\langle k(\\langle X,Y \\rangle e_i - \\langle e_i, Y \\rangle X), e_i \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity of the inner product, we can separate the terms on the right-hand side. The quantities $k$, $\\langle X,Y \\rangle$, and $\\langle e_i, Y \\rangle$ are scalars and can be factored out of the inner products.\n$$\n\\langle R(e_i, X)Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\langle X,Y \\rangle \\langle e_i, e_i \\rangle - k \\langle e_i, Y \\rangle \\langle X, e_i \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ is an orthonormal frame, we have $\\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. In particular, $\\langle e_i, e_i \\rangle = 1$ for all $i$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\langle R(e_i, X)Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle\n$$\nThe Ricci curvature is the sum of these terms over all $i$ from $1$ to $n$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nWe can split the summation into two parts:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle\n$$\nFor the first term, $k \\langle X,Y \\rangle$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $i$, so summing it $n$ times yields:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X,Y \\rangle = n k \\langle X,Y \\rangle\n$$\nFor the second term, we analyze the summation $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle$. This is the expression for the inner product $\\langle X,Y \\rangle$ in the orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}$. To see this, we can write $X = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle e_j$ and $Y = \\sum_{l=1}^n \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle e_l$. Then,\n$$\n\\langle X,Y \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle e_j, \\sum_{l=1}^n \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle e_l \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{j,l=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle \\langle e_j, e_l \\rangle = \\sum_{j,l=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle \\delta_{jl} = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle \\langle Y, e_j \\rangle\n$$\nThus, the second term in the expression for $\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\langle X,Y \\rangle\n$$\nCombining the results for the two terms, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = n k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - k \\langle X,Y \\rangle = (n-1) k \\langle X,Y \\rangle\n$$\nThis equation holds for any arbitrary vectors $X$ and $Y$. The expression on the right is a bilinear form.

That is, we require:\n$$\n\\frac{K}{c} = 1\n$$\nSince we are given that $K > 0$, we can solve for $c$ to find\n$$\nc = K\n$$\nThis is a positive constant, as required for a valid metric scaling.\n\nLet's now define our new metric specifically as $\\hat{g} = K g$.

Therefore, we can apply its conclusion to find an upper bound for the diameter of $(M,\\hat{g})$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) \\le \\pi\n$$\nThe final step is to relate this result back to the diameter of the original manifold $(M,g)$. The problem provides the scaling law for the diameter:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\tilde{g}) = \\sqrt{c}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g)\n$$\nIn our case, $\\tilde{g} = \\hat{g}$ and the scaling constant is $c=K$. Substituting these into the scaling rule gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) = \\sqrt{K}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g)\n$$\nWe now have two statements about $\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g})$:\n1. $\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) \\le \\pi$\n2. $\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) = \\sqrt{K}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g)$\n\nCombining these two statements, we get the inequality:\n$$\n\\sqrt{K}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g) \\le \\pi\n$$\nSince $K > 0$, $\\sqrt{K}$ is a positive real number, so we can divide by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,g) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}\n$$\nThis inequality provides an upper bound for the diameter of any manifold satisfying the given conditions.

This sharpness carries through the scaling argument, meaning our derived constant $C(K)$ is also sharp.
