The $n$-torus is defined as the quotient space $\\mathbb{T}^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n}/\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. This means we can identify a function $u: \\mathbb{T}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ with a function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that is periodic with period $1$ in each coordinate variable $x_i$, for $i=1, \\dots, n$. The metric on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ is the flat metric inherited from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In the natural coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$, the metric tensor is given by $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ is defined as the divergence of the gradient, $\\Delta u = \\mathrm{div}(\\nabla u)$. In local coordinates, this is given by $\\Delta u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^j} \\right)$. For the flat metric on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$, we have $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, so the inverse metric is $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$ and the determinant is $\\det(g) = 1$. The formula for the Laplacian simplifies to the standard Euclidean Laplacian:\n$$ \\Delta u = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{(\\partial x^i)^2} $$\nThe eigenvalue problem is stated as $- \\Delta u = \\lambda u$, which becomes:\n$$ - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{(\\partial x^i)^2} = \\lambda u $$\nWe are instructed to use a Fourier series representation. A smooth, square-integrable function $u(x)$ on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ can be expanded in a Fourier series:\n$$ u(x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} c_k e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle} $$\nwhere $k = (k_1, \\dots, k_n)$ is a vector of integers, $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is the coordinate vector, and $\\langle k, x \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j x_j$ is the standard dot product. The functions $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ form a complete orthonormal basis for $L^2(\\mathbb{T}^n)$. We test whether these basis functions are eigenfunctions of the operator $- \\Delta$.\n\nLet us apply the operator to a single basis function $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ for a fixed $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $x_j$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} e^{i 2\\pi \\sum_{l=1}^n k_l x_l} = (i 2\\pi k_j) e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle} $$\nThe second partial derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_k}{(\\partial x_j)^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( (i 2\\pi k_j) u_k(x) \\right) = (i 2\\pi k_j)^2 u_k(x) = -4\\pi^2 k_j^2 u_k(x) $$\nNow, we compute $-\\Delta u_k$:\n$$ -\\Delta u_k = - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_k}{(\\partial x_j)^2} = - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-4\\pi^2 k_j^2 u_k(x)) = \\left( 4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2 \\right) u_k(x) $$\nLet $|k|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2$ be the squared Euclidean norm of the integer vector $k$. The equation becomes:\n$$ -\\Delta u_k = (4\\pi^2 |k|^2) u_k $$\nThis confirms that $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ is an eigenfunction of $-\\Delta$ with the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 |k|^2$.\n\nSince the set of functions $\\{u_k(x)\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n}$ forms a complete basis for $L^2(\\mathbb{T}^n)$, we have found the complete set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.\nThe eigenfunctions are $u_k(x) = e^{i 2\\pi \\langle k, x \\rangle}$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\nThe set of eigenvalues is $\\{\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 |k|^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the first positive eigenvalue, denoted $\\lambda_1$. The eigenvalues are determined by the squared norm of integer vectors $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\nFor $k = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$, we have $|k|^2 = 0$, which gives the eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 4\\pi^2(0) = 0$. The corresponding eigenfunction is $u_0(x) = e^0 = 1$, the constant function. This is a non-positive eigenvalue.\n\nThe first positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ corresponds to the smallest non-zero value of $|k|^2$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The quantity $|k|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$ is a sum of squares of integers. For this sum to be non-zero, at least one $k_j$ must be a non-zero integer. The smallest non-zero integer squares are $(\\pm 1)^2 = 1$. Thus, the minimum non-zero value of $|k|^2$ is $1$. This minimum is achieved when exactly one component $k_j$ is equal to $\\pm 1$ and all other components are $0$. For example, for $k=(1, 0, \\dots, 0)$, we have $|k|^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2 = 1$.\nThe first positive eigenvalue is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} |k|^2 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot 1 = 4\\pi^2 $$\n\nFinally, we must explain how this result is consistent with the Lichnerowicz estimate. The Lichnerowicz estimate for a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ states that if the Ricci curvature tensor satisfies $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq (n-1) K g(v, v)$ for some constant $K$, then the first positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the operator $-\\Delta$ is bounded below by $\\lambda_1 \\geq nK$.\nFor the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$, the metric is flat, which means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, its Ricci curvature tensor is also identically zero, $\\mathrm{Ric} = 0$. This satisfies the condition $\\mathrm{Ric} \\geq (n-1)K g$ with the constant $K=0$.\nApplying the Lichnerowicz estimate with $K=0$, we get the lower bound:\n$$ \\lambda_1 \\geq n \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nOur calculated value for the first positive eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = 4\\pi^2$. Since $4\\pi^2 > 0$, our result is fully consistent with the Lichnerowicz estimate.

At a point $x \\in S^n$, the tangent space is $T_x S^n = \\{ v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\langle v, x \\rangle = 0 \\}$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the Euclidean inner product.

Compute the Divergence $\\operatorname{div}_{g}(X)$**\n\nThe divergence of a tangent vector field $X$ on a Riemannian manifold can be calculated at a point $x$ by the formula:\n$$ \\operatorname{div}_{g}(X)(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g(\\nabla_{E_k} X, E_k) $$\nwhere $\\{E_k\\}_{k=1}^n$ is any orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_x S^n$, and $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection on $S^n$. The connection $\\nabla$ on the submanifold is related to the ambient connection $\\bar{\\nabla}$ (which is just the standard directional derivative in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$) by the formula $\\nabla_V Y = (\\bar{\\nabla}_V Y)^{\\top}$.\n\nTherefore, $g(\\nabla_{E_k} X, E_k) = \\langle (\\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} X)^{\\top}, E_k \\rangle = \\langle \\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} X, E_k \\rangle$ since $E_k$ is tangential.

So, we have:\n$$ \\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} X = - \\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} (y_i y) \\Big|_{y=x} = - \\left( (\\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} y_i) y + y_i (\\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} y) \\right) \\Big|_{y=x} $$\nThe directional derivative of the scalar function $y_i$ along $E_k$ is $\\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} y_i = \\langle \\bar{\\nabla} y_i, E_k \\rangle = \\langle e_i, E_k \\rangle$.\nThe directional derivative of the position vector field $y$ along $E_k$ is $\\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} y = E_k$.\nSubstituting these back, and evaluating at $y=x$:\n$$ \\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} X = - \\left( \\langle e_i, E_k \\rangle x + x_i E_k \\right) $$\nNow we take the inner product with $E_k$:\n$$ \\langle \\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} X, E_k \\rangle = \\langle - \\left( \\langle e_i, E_k \\rangle x + x_i E_k \\right), E_k \\rangle = - \\langle e_i, E_k \\rangle \\langle x, E_k \\rangle - x_i \\langle E_k, E_k \\rangle $$\nSince $\\{E_k\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_x S^n$:\n-   $E_k$ is orthogonal to the normal vector $x$, so $\\langle x, E_k \\rangle = 0$.\n-   The basis is orthonormal, so $\\langle E_k, E_k \\rangle = 1$.\n\nThe expression simplifies dramatically:\n$$ \\langle \\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} X, E_k \\rangle = - \\langle e_i, E_k \\rangle (0) - x_i (1) = -x_i $$\nThe divergence is the sum of these terms over the basis:\n$$ \\Delta f_i(x) = \\operatorname{div}_{g}(X)(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\langle \\bar{\\nabla}_{E_k} X, E_k \\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-x_i) $$\nSince the term $-x_i$ is constant with respect to the summation index $k$, and there are $n$ terms in the sum (because the dimension of $S^n$ is $n$):\n$$ \\Delta f_i(x) = -n x_i $$\n\nThis result is consistent with the well-known fact that the coordinate functions $x_i$ restricted to $S^n$ are eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Specifically, they belong to the first non-zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the operator $-\\Delta$. For $S^n$, this eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1=n$. Thus, $-\\Delta f_i = n f_i$, which implies $\\Delta f_i = -n f_i = -n x_i$, confirming our calculation.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator of $f_i$ on $S^n$ is $\\Delta f_i(x) = -n x_i$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-n x_{i}}$$", "id": "3071872"}, {"introduction": "Having established the value of $\\lambda_1$ on the sphere, we can now delve deeper to understand *why* the Lichnerowicz estimate is sharp in this case.
