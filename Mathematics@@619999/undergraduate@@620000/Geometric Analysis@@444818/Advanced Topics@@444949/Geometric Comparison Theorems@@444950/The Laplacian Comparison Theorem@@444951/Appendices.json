Let the coordinates of $x$ be $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ and the coordinates of the fixed point $p$ be $(p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n)$. The function $r(x)$ is the Euclidean norm of the vector $x-p$, which can be written as:\n$$r(x) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - p_i)^2 \\right)^{1/2}$$\nFor brevity, we will denote $r(x)$ simply as $r$.

We are tasked with computing the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the geodesic distance function $r(x) = d(p,x)$ on the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps as instructed.\n\nFirst, we introduce geodesic normal coordinates centered at the point $p \\in S^n$. A point $x \\in S^n$ within the domain $\\{x \\in S^n : 0  r(x)  \\pi\\}$ can be uniquely specified by its distance $r = d(p,x)$ and the direction of the minimal geodesic from $p$ to $x$. This direction is represented by a unit vector in the tangent space $T_p S^n$, which is a point $\\theta$ on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. Thus, we have coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ where $r \\in (0, \\pi)$ and $\\theta \\in S^{n-1}$.\n\nIn these coordinates, the function to be differentiated is simply $r$. The gradient of a function $f$ is the vector field $\\nabla f$ metrically dual to its differential $df$. For the function $f(x)=r(x)$, its differential is $dr$. By Gauss's Lemma, the radial vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ is orthogonal to the geodesic spheres of constant $r$. The Riemannian metric $g$ in these coordinates is block-diagonal: $ds^2 = g_{rr}dr^2 + g_{\\alpha\\beta}d\\theta^\\alpha d\\theta^\\beta$. Since $r$ is the arc-length parameter, $g_{rr} = \\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\rangle = 1$. Consequently, the inverse metric component $g^{rr}$ is also $1$, and the mixed components $g^{r\\alpha}$ are $0$. The gradient of $r$ is given by $\\nabla r = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. Since $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial r} = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\theta^\\alpha} = 0$, this simplifies to $\\nabla r = g^{rr}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator is defined as the divergence of the gradient, $\\Delta f = \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla f)$. For a vector field $X = X^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$, the divergence is given in local coordinates by the formula $\\operatorname{div}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det g}} \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} (\\sqrt{\\det g} \\, X^i)$.\nLet $J(r,\\theta) = \\sqrt{\\det g}$ be the Riemannian volume density. For the vector field $X = \\nabla r = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$, its only non-zero component is $X^r = 1$. Applying the divergence formula, we get:\n$$ \\Delta r = \\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right) = \\frac{1}{J(r,\\theta)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( J(r,\\theta) \\cdot 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{J(r,\\theta)} \\frac{\\partial J(r,\\theta)}{\\partial r} $$\nThis expression can be written as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\ln J)$, as requested by the problem statement.\n\nSecond, we determine the $r$-dependence of the volume density $J(r,\\theta)$. This is achieved by analyzing the behavior of Jacobi fields along radial geodesics emanating from $p$. The sphere $S^n$ has constant sectional curvature $K=1$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a unit-speed geodesic starting at $p$, i.e., $\\gamma(0)=p$. A Jacobi field $Y(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$ that is orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation $Y''(t) + K Y(t) = 0$. With $K=1$, this is $Y''(t) + Y(t) = 0$.\n\nFor geodesic polar coordinates, the relevant Jacobi fields describe how geodesics spread out from the pole $p$. Such fields satisfy the initial conditions $Y(0)=0$ and $Y'(0)=v$, where $v$ is a tangent vector at $p$ orthogonal to $\\gamma'(0)$. Let's consider a scalar function $y(t)$ representing the magnitude of $Y(t)$ for an initial velocity $v$ with $|v|=1$. This function $y(t)$ must solve $y''(t) + y(t) = 0$ with initial conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=1$. The unique solution is $y(t) = \\sin(t)$.\n\nThe function $y(r) = \\sin(r)$ describes how the exponential map scales lengths perpendicular to the radial direction. The metric on a geodesic sphere of radius $r$ in $S^n$ is related to the standard metric on $S^{n-1}$, denoted $g_{S^{n-1}}$, by this scaling factor. Specifically, the metric on the sphere of radius $r$ in the flat tangent space $T_p S^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$ is $r^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$. The exponential map scales lengths on this sphere by a factor of $\\frac{y(r)}{r} = \\frac{\\sin(r)}{r}$. Thus, the metric tensor on the geodesic sphere of radius $r$ in $S^n$ becomes $g_{sphere,r} = \\left(\\frac{\\sin(r)}{r}\\right)^2 (r^2 g_{S^{n-1}}) = (\\sin(r))^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$.\n\nThe full metric tensor in geodesic normal coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ is therefore:\n$$ ds^2 = dr^2 + (\\sin(r))^2 g_{S^{n-1}} $$\nThe determinant of this block-diagonal metric is $\\det g = \\det((\\sin(r))^2 g_{S^{n-1}})$. Since $g_{S^{n-1}}$ is an $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ matrix, we have $\\det g = ((\\sin(r))^2)^{n-1} \\det(g_{S^{n-1}}) = (\\sin(r))^{2(n-1)} \\det(g_{S^{n-1}})$.\nThe volume density is $J(r,\\theta) = \\sqrt{\\det g}$. Since we are on the domain $r \\in (0, \\pi)$, $\\sin(r)  0$. So,\n$$ J(r,\\theta) = (\\sin(r))^{n-1} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{S^{n-1}})} $$\nThe term $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{S^{n-1}})}$ depends only on the coordinates $\\theta$ on the sphere $S^{n-1}$, not on $r$.\n\nThird, we combine these results. We compute the partial derivative of $J(r,\\theta)$ with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left[ (\\sin(r))^{n-1} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{S^{n-1}})} \\right] = (n-1)(\\sin(r))^{n-2}(\\cos(r)) \\sqrt{\\det(g_{S^{n-1}})} $$\nNow we substitute this into our expression for $\\Delta r$:\n$$ \\Delta r = \\frac{1}{J(r,\\theta)} \\frac{\\partial J(r,\\theta)}{\\partial r} = \\frac{(n-1)(\\sin(r))^{n-2}(\\cos(r)) \\sqrt{\\det(g_{S^{n-1}})}}{(\\sin(r))^{n-1} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{S^{n-1}})}} $$\nThe term involving the volume element of $S^{n-1}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$ \\Delta r = \\frac{(n-1)(\\sin(r))^{n-2}(\\cos(r))}{(\\sin(r))^{n-1}} = (n-1)\\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\sin(r)} $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the Laplacian of the distance function on the unit $n$-sphere.\n$$ \\Delta r = (n-1)\\cot(r) $$\nThis expression is valid for $r \\in (0, \\pi)$ and for any dimension $n \\ge 2$.

The expression containing all terms up to and including order $r$ is also $2\\alpha r$, as the constant term is zero.\n\n**Part 4: Justification via Laplacian Comparison Theorem**\n\nThe Laplacian Comparison Theorem relates the geometry of the manifold, encoded by its curvature, to the behavior of $\\Delta r$. For a $2$-dimensional manifold, the theorem (in one of its forms) states that if the Gaussian curvature $K$ satisfies $K \\le k$ for some constant $k$, then $\\Delta r \\ge m_{k}(r)$ (away from the pole and its cut locus).\n\nFor a metric of the form $g = dr^{2} + \\phi(r)^{2}d\\theta^{2}$, the Gaussian curvature is given by the formula $K(r) = -\\frac{\\phi''(r)}{\\phi(r)}$.

Since $\\alpha$ is a positive constant, $K(0)  0$. More generally, for any $r  0$, $K(r)$ is negative.\nThis means we have an upper bound on the curvature, $K(r) \\le 0$, for all small $r$. We can therefore apply the Laplacian Comparison Theorem with the model space of constant curvature $k=0$ (Euclidean space).\nThe theorem predicts that $\\Delta r \\ge m_{0}(r)$, which implies $\\Delta r - m_{0}(r) \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's check our computed result. We found:\n$$\n\\Delta r - m_{0}(r) = \\frac{2\\alpha r}{1 + \\alpha r^{2}}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$ and we are in the domain $r  0$, both the numerator $2\\alpha r$ and the denominator $1 + \\alpha r^{2}$ are positive. Therefore, $\\Delta r - m_{0}(r)  0$. This is consistent with the prediction of the Laplacian Comparison Theorem.
