The derivation must begin from the fundamental definitions of the gradient and divergence on a Riemannian manifold.\n\nFirst, we must establish the local coordinate representation of the metric tensor on $S^1$. The unit circle is parameterized by the angular coordinate $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, with points identified modulo $2\\pi$. The embedding into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by the map $\\mathbf{x}(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$. The standard round metric on $S^1$ is the one induced by the Euclidean metric on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The tangent vector to the curve $\\mathbf{x}(\\theta)$ is $\\mathbf{x}'(\\theta) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{d\\theta} = (-\\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nIn the local coordinate system defined by $\\theta$, the single component of the metric tensor, $g_{\\theta\\theta}$, is given by the inner product of the basis tangent vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ with itself. In the embedding, this is the dot product of the velocity vector $\\mathbf{x}'(\\theta)$:\n$$g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\langle \\mathbf{x}'(\\theta), \\mathbf{x}'(\\theta) \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^2} = (-\\sin\\theta)^2 + (\\cos\\theta)^2 = \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$$\nThe metric tensor in this coordinate is simply the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $g = (1)$, so its only component is $g_{\\theta\\theta} = 1$. Consequently, the component of the inverse metric tensor is $g^{\\theta\\theta} = (g_{\\theta\\theta})^{-1} = 1$. The determinant of the metric tensor is $\\det(g) = 1$, and thus $\\sqrt{|\\det(g)|} = 1$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the gradient of a smooth function $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The gradient of $f$, denoted $\\nabla f$, is the vector field whose components $(\\nabla f)^i$ in a local coordinate system $x^i$ are given by:\n$$(\\nabla f)^i = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}$$\nFor $S^1$ with the single coordinate $\\theta$, this simplifies to:\n$$(\\nabla f)^\\theta = g^{\\theta\\theta} \\frac{df}{d\\theta} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{df}{d\\theta} = \\frac{df}{d\\theta}$$\nThe gradient is the vector field $\\nabla f = \\frac{df}{d\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the divergence of a vector field $X$. In local coordinates $x^i$, the divergence of $X = X^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ is given by the formula:\n$$\\text{div}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|\\det(g)|}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sqrt{|\\det(g)|} X^i \\right)$$\nFor a vector field $X = X^\\theta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ on $S^1$, using $\\sqrt{|\\det(g)|} = 1$, this becomes:\n$$\\text{div}(X) = \\frac{1}{1} \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( 1 \\cdot X^\\theta \\right) = \\frac{dX^\\theta}{d\\theta}$$\n\nThe Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ is defined as the divergence of the gradient: $\\Delta f = \\text{div}(\\nabla f)$. We apply our divergence formula to the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$, whose single component is $(\\nabla f)^\\theta = \\frac{df}{d\\theta}$:\n$$\\Delta f = \\text{div}(\\nabla f) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left((\\nabla f)^\\theta\\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\frac{df}{d\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2}$$\nThus, for the unit circle with its standard metric, the Laplace-Beltrami operator is simply the second derivative with respect to the angular coordinate.\n\nWe now solve the specified eigenvalue problem, $-\\Delta f = \\lambda f$, with the condition that $f$ is a nonconstant, smooth, real-valued function satisfying the periodicity condition $f(\\theta + 2\\pi) = f(\\theta)$. Substituting the derived form of $\\Delta$:\n$$-\\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2} = \\lambda f \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2} + \\lambda f = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. We analyze the solutions based on the sign of $\\lambda$.\n\nCase 1: $\\lambda = 0$.\nThe equation is $\\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2} = 0$, with general solution $f(\\theta) = A\\theta + B$. Applying the periodicity condition $f(\\theta+2\\pi) = f(\\theta)$ gives $A(\\theta+2\\pi)+B = A\\theta+B$, which implies $2\\pi A = 0$, so $A=0$. The solution is $f(\\theta) = B$, a constant function. Since the problem asks for a nonconstant eigenfunction, we are interested in $\\lambda > 0$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$ corresponds to the constant eigenfunctions.\n\nCase 2: $\\lambda  0$.\nLet $\\lambda = -k^2$ for some $k > 0$. The equation becomes $\\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2} - k^2 f = 0$. The general solution is $f(\\theta) = A e^{k\\theta} + B e^{-k\\theta}$. For this solution to be periodic, we must have $A e^{k(\\theta+2\\pi)} + B e^{-k(\\theta+2\\pi)} = A e^{k\\theta} + B e^{-k\\theta}$. This requires $A(e^{2\\pi k}-1)e^{k\\theta} + B(e^{-2\\pi k}-1)e^{-k\\theta} = 0$ for all $\\theta$. Since $e^{k\\theta}$ and $e^{-k\\theta}$ are linearly independent, their coefficients must be zero. As $k>0$, $e^{2\\pi k} \\neq 1$ and $e^{-2\\pi k} \\neq 1$, which forces $A=0$ and $B=0$. This yields only the trivial solution $f(\\theta)=0$. Thus, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\nCase 3: $\\lambda > 0$.\nLet $\\lambda = k^2$ for some $k > 0$. The equation is $\\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2} + k^2 f = 0$. The general real-valued solution is $f(\\theta) = A \\cos(k\\theta) + B \\sin(k\\theta)$, where $A$ and $B$ are not both zero. The periodicity condition $f(\\theta+2\\pi) = f(\\theta)$ requires that $k$ must be a positive integer, $k = n$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. For such $k=n$, the functions $\\cos(n\\theta)$ and $\\sin(n\\theta)$ have a period of $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$, which is a submultiple of $2\\pi$, thus satisfying the condition.\n\nThe positive eigenvalues are therefore given by $\\lambda_n = k^2 = n^2$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The spectrum of $-\\Delta$ on $S^1$ is $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots\\}$. The problem asks for the *first positive* eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1$. This corresponds to the smallest positive integer $n=1$.\n$$\\lambda_1 = 1^2 = 1$$\nThe eigenfunctions corresponding to $\\lambda_1=1$ are of the form $f(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\theta) + B \\sin(\\theta)$ for any constants $A, B \\in \\mathbb{R}$ not both zero. We must provide one explicit nonconstant eigenfunction. A simple choice is to set $A=1$ and $B=0$, which gives $f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$. Another valid choice is $f(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)$ (by setting $A=0, B=1$). Both are nonconstant, $2\\pi$-periodic, and satisfy $-\\Delta f = f$. For instance, for $f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$, we have $-\\Delta f = -\\frac{d^2}{d\\theta^2}(\\cos\\theta) = -(-\\cos\\theta) = \\cos\\theta = 1 \\cdot f$.\n\nThis result for $S^1$ is the simplest case illustrating the principles behind Obata's Rigidity Theorem, which connects the value of $\\lambda_1$ for a general compact Riemannian manifold to its geometry, specifically providing a condition for the manifold to be isometric to a standard sphere. The first positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ for the unit circle $S^1$ ($n=1$ sphere of radius $R=1$) matches the general formula for the standard sphere $S^n(R)$, $\\lambda_1 = n/R^2$, which gives $\\lambda_1 = 1/1^2 = 1$.\n\nThe required values are the first positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ and an associated explicit nonconstant eigenfunction, such as $f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  \\cos(\\theta)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3073574"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the circle, we now turn to the sphere, the central object of study in the Obata Rigidity Theorem.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We proceed with the solution. The problem consists of two main parts concerning the flat $n$-torus $(T^n, g)$.\n\nPart 1: Proof that the Ricci curvature of $(T^{n},g)$ is identically zero.\n\nThe $n$-torus $T^n$ is defined as the quotient manifold $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The Riemannian metric $g$ on $T^n$ is induced by the standard Euclidean metric $g_{E}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This means that the canonical projection map $\\pi: (\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E) \\to (T^n, g)$ is a local isometry.\n\nLet $R_{T^n}$ and $R_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$ denote the Riemann curvature tensors of $(T^n, g)$ and $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_E)$, respectively. A fundamental property of local isometries is that they preserve the Riemann curvature tensor. For any point $p \\in T^n$, we can choose a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ and a corresponding neighborhood $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the restriction of the projection map, $\\pi|_V : V \\to U$, is an isometry. Consequently, for any point $q \\in V$ mapping to $\\pi(q) \\in U$, the curvature tensor of $T^n$ at $\\pi(q)$ is equal to the curvature tensor of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ at $q$.\n\nThe problem states as a given fact that the Riemann curvature tensor on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard Euclidean metric is identically zero. That is, $R_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\equiv 0$. Since for every point $p \\in T^n$ there exists a local isometry from a neighborhood in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to a neighborhood of $p$, it follows that the Riemann curvature tensor of the torus, $R_{T^n}$, must also be identically zero everywhere.\n\nThe Ricci curvature tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}$, is defined as a trace of the full Riemann curvature tensor $R$. In local coordinates, its components are given by $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = R^k_{ikj} = g^{kl} R_{likj}$. In a more coordinate-free manner, for any tangent vectors $X$ and $Y$, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\operatorname{Ric}(X, Y) = \\operatorname{tr}(Z \\mapsto R(Z, X)Y)$. If the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero, then all of its traces must also be identically zero.\n\nTherefore, because $R_{T^n} \\equiv 0$, it follows directly that the Ricci curvature tensor of the torus is also identically zero, i.e., $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the first nonzero eigenvalue of $\\Delta$ on $(T^{n},g)$ and its relation to the Lichnerowicz–Obata theorem.\n\nThe Laplace–Beltrami operator on $(T^n, g)$ acts on smooth functions $f: T^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Such functions can be identified with smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that are periodic with respect to the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, i.e., $f(x+k) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$.\n\nSince the metric on $T^n$ is locally Euclidean, the expression for the Laplacian in the standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the same as the standard Euclidean Laplacian. With the given sign convention $\\Delta = -\\operatorname{div}(\\nabla f)$, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta = -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial(x^j)^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that smooth functions on $T^n$ admit Fourier series expansions. A basis for the space of square-integrable functions $L^2(T^n)$ is given by the set of complex exponential functions $\\{f_k(x) = \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$, where $k = (k_1, \\dots, k_n)$ is a vector of integers and $\\langle k, x \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j x^j$. These functions are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. To find the eigenvalues, we apply $\\Delta$ to an eigenfunction $f_k(x)$:\n$$\n\\Delta f_k(x) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial(x^j)^2} \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle)\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) = (2\\pi i k_j) \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial(x^j)^2} \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) = (2\\pi i k_j)^2 \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle) = -4\\pi^2 k_j^2 \\exp(2\\pi i \\langle k, x \\rangle)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the Laplacian:\n$$\n\\Delta f_k(x) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-4\\pi^2 k_j^2) f_k(x) = \\left(4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j^2\\right) f_k(x) = (4\\pi^2 \\|k\\|^2) f_k(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\|k\\|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$ is the squared Euclidean norm of the integer vector $k$.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of $\\Delta$ on $T^n$ are given by $\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 \\|k\\|^2$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The spectrum of the Laplacian is the set of these values.\nThe lowest eigenvalue corresponds to $k=0$, which gives $\\lambda_0 = 4\\pi^2 \\|0\\|^2 = 0$. The corresponding eigenfunctions are constant functions.\nThe problem asks for the first *nonzero* eigenvalue, denoted $\\lambda_1$. This corresponds to the smallest possible positive value of $\\lambda_k$. This occurs for the integer vectors $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ for which $\\|k\\|^2$ is minimized, subject to $k \\neq 0$. The minimum nonzero value of $\\|k\\|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$ for $k_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is $1$. This is achieved when one component $k_j$ is $\\pm 1$ and all other components are $0$.\nTherefore, the first nonzero eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = 4\\pi^2 \\cdot 1 = 4\\pi^2\n$$\nRegarding the Lichnerowicz–Obata theorem: This theorem provides a sharp lower bound on the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold under a strictly positive lower bound on its Ricci curvature. Specifically, if $(M^n, g)$ is a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric}(X, X) \\ge (n-1)c g(X, X)$ for some constant $c > 0$, then $\\lambda_1 \\ge nc$. The theorem further states that equality $\\lambda_1 = nc$ holds if and only if $(M, g)$ is isometric to the standard $n$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$ of constant sectional curvature $c$.\n\nThe flat torus $(T^n, g)$ provides a crucial example illustrating why the hypothesis $c > 0$ cannot be dropped. For the torus, we proved that $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$. This satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)c g$ for the limiting case $c=0$. However, the torus $T^n$ is topologically and geometrically distinct from the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$ (for $n \\ge 2$, their fundamental groups are $\\pi_1(T^n) = \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{S}^n) = \\{e\\}$). The existence of the flat torus, a non-spherical manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature, demonstrates that the powerful rigidity conclusion of the Lichnerowicz-Obata theorem (i.e., that the manifold must be a sphere) collapses when the Ricci curvature is allowed to be zero. The strictly positive lower bound on Ricci curvature is therefore an essential hypothesis for the theorem's characterization of the sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi^{2}}$$", "id": "3075196"}]}
