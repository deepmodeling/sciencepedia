It presents a standard problem in Riemannian geometry concerning the derivation and analysis of Jacobi fields in Euclidean space. The provided definitions and conditions are accurate and consistent. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental equation governing the behavior of a variational vector field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + R(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}=0\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along the geodesic, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nThe problem is set in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^n$, endowed with its standard flat metric. For this space, we are given the following:\n1.  The geodesic is a straight line traversed at unit speed: $\\gamma(t) = p + tv$, where $p, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $|v|=1$. The velocity vector is constant: $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = v$.\n2.  The Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is the standard directional derivative. For a vector field $X(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$, this means $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} X = \\frac{dX}{dt}$.\n3.  The Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero: $R(U,V)W = 0$ for all vectors $U,V,W$.\n\nSubstituting these properties into the Jacobi equation simplifies it considerably. The covariant derivative term becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\left( \\frac{dJ}{dt} \\right) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{dJ}{dt} \\right) = \\frac{d^2 J}{dt^2}\n$$\nThe curvature term vanishes:\n$$\nR(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = R(J(t), v)v = 0\n$$\nThus, the Jacobi equation in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ reduces to the following second-order linear ordinary differential equation for the vector-valued function $J(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 J}{dt^2} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to $t$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{dt} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant vector of integration. Integrating a second time gives the general solution for $J(t)$:\n$$\nJ(t) = C_1 t + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is another constant vector of integration.\n\nTo find the specific solution, we apply the given initial conditions:\n1.  $J(0) = A$\n2.  $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(0) = B$\n\nFrom the first condition, we evaluate the general solution at $t=0$:\n$$\nJ(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = C_2\n$$\nComparing this with the initial condition $J(0)=A$, we find $C_2=A$.\n\nFrom the second condition, we first evaluate the derivative of the general solution:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t) = \\frac{dJ}{dt} = C_1\n$$\nEvaluating this at $t=0$ gives $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(0) = C_1$. Comparing this with the initial condition $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(0)=B$, we find $C_1=B$.\n\nSubstituting the determined constants $C_1=B$ and $C_2=A$ back into the general solution, we obtain the explicit solution for the Jacobi field:\n$$\nJ(t) = A + tB\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $J(t)$ is a normal Jacobi field, meaning $J(t) \\perp \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. Let's verify this. $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = v$. We are given $A \\perp v$ and $B \\perp v$, which translates to $A \\cdot v = 0$ and $B \\cdot v = 0$. The inner product is:\n$$\nJ(t) \\cdot v = (A+tB) \\cdot v = A \\cdot v + t(B \\cdot v) = 0 + t(0) = 0\n$$\nThis holds for all $t$, confirming that our solution represents a normal Jacobi field as required.\n\nNext, we seek necessary and sufficient conditions for $J(t)$ to have zeros at times $t \\neq 0$. A zero of $J(t)$ occurs when $J(t)=0$. We must solve the vector equation for $t \\neq 0$:\n$$\nA+tB = 0 \\implies tB = -A\n$$\nFor a non-trivial Jacobi field (where $A$ and $B$ are not both zero), we analyze the following cases:\n- If $B=0$, the equation becomes $A=0$. If $A \\neq 0$, there is no solution for $t$. If $A=0$ as well, $J(t)$ is identically zero, which is the trivial case. So for a non-trivial field with $B=0$, there are no zeros.\n- If $B \\neq 0$, the equation $tB=-A$ implies that the vector $A$ must be collinear with the vector $B$. That is, there must exist a scalar $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $A=kB$. Substituting this gives $tB = -kB$. Since $B \\neq 0$, we can conclude $t=-k$.\n- The condition that the zero occurs at $t \\neq 0$ implies that $k \\neq 0$. This, in turn, implies that $A \\neq 0$ (since $B \\neq 0$).\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)=A+tB$ to have a zero at $t \\neq 0$ are that the initial vectors $A$ and $B$ are non-zero and linearly dependent.\n\nFinally, we connect this result to the Rauch comparison theorem. This theorem compares the length of Jacobi fields on manifolds with different curvature bounds. The Euclidean space, with its constant zero sectional curvature, serves as the fundamental reference model. The tendency of geodesics to converge or diverge is encoded in the behavior of Jacobi fields. Positive curvature causes geodesics to reconverge, leading to conjugate points, which are pairs of points on a geodesic connected by a non-trivial Jacobi field that vanishes at both points.\n\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^n$, let's search for points conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$. This requires finding a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_1)=0$ for some $t_1 \\neq 0$. The condition $J(0)=0$ means $A=0$. The Jacobi field is then $J(t)=tB$. For this field to be non-trivial, we must have $B \\neq 0$. The equation for a zero is $tB=0$, which for $B \\neq 0$ has the unique solution $t=0$. Thus, there are no conjugate points along any geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThis result is perfectly consistent with the Rauch comparison theorem. The linear growth of our solution $|J(t)|=|A+tB|$ exemplifies the neutral behavior of a flat manifold. There is no intrinsic curvature to cause geodesics to focus (like on a sphere, positive curvature) or to spread out more rapidly (like on a hyperbolic plane, negative curvature). The absence of conjugate points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the benchmark against which other spaces are compared: a space with positive curvature will exhibit conjugate points, while a simply connected space with non-positive curvature will not.

Since $t0$, this forces $A_i=0$ for all $i$. This contradicts the requirement that $J$ is non-trivial. Therefore, no conjugate points exist. By convention, the first conjugate time is infinite: $t_c(0) = +\\infty$.\n\nCase 3: $k  0$\nLet's write $k = -\\omega^2$ where $\\omega = \\sqrt{-k}  0$.

The condition $J(t)=0$ for $t0$ requires $B_i \\sinh(\\omega t) = 0$.\nThe hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(x)$ is zero only if $x=0$. Since $\\omega0$ and we consider $t0$, the argument $\\omega t$ is strictly positive, so $\\sinh(\\omega t) \\neq 0$. This forces $B_i=0$ for all $i$, which again contradicts the non-triviality of $J$. Thus, no conjugate points exist. The first conjugate time is $t_c(k) = +\\infty$ for $k0$.\n\nCombining these three cases gives the closed-form expression for $t_c(k)$:\n$$\nt_c(k) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}  \\text{if } k  0 \\\\ +\\infty  \\text{if } k \\le 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis result is consistent with the Rauch comparison theorem. The theorem, in essence, states that higher curvature causes geodesics to converge more rapidly. The first conjugate time $t_c$ marks the point where geodesics emanating from a point begin to refocus. A higher curvature $k$ implies stronger focusing, and thus one expects a smaller value for $t_c$.\nOur derived function $t_c(k)$ is a non-increasing function of $k$.\nFor $k  0$, $t_c(k) = \\pi/\\sqrt{k}$ is a strictly decreasing function of $k$. As $k_1  k_2  0$, we have $t_c(k_1)  t_c(k_2)$, which is consistent with Rauch's theorem.\nWhen going from positive curvature to non-positive curvature (e.g., $k_10$ and $k_2 \\le 0$), the first conjugate time jumps from a finite value $\\pi/\\sqrt{k_1}$ to $+\\infty$, meaning refocusing ceases to occur. This again aligns with the principle that lower curvature leads to weaker (or no) focusing of geodesics. For any $k_1  k_2$ where $k_2 \\le 0$, we have $t_c(k_1) \\le t_c(k_2)$.
