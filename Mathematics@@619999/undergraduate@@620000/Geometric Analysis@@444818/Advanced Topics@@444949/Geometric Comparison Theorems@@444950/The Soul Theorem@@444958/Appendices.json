This allows us to identify a soul for Euclidean space.\n\nLet $S$ be a submanifold of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ that is compact, connected, totally convex, and without boundary.\n\n$1$. The manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ has sectional curvature equal to $0$ everywhere. The geodesics are straight lines. A geodesic segment between two points $p, q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the line segment $[p, q] = \\{ (1-t)p + tq \\mid t \\in [0, 1] \\}$. This segment is the unique minimizing geodesic between $p$ and $q$.\n\n$2$. The definition of a totally convex submanifold $S$ requires that for any two points $p, q \\in S$, the minimizing geodesic segment between them lies entirely in $S$. Applying this to our case, for any $p, q \\in S$, the straight line segment $[p,q]$ must be contained in $S$.\n\n$3$. This property is precisely the definition of a convex set in Euclidean space. Therefore, $S$ must be a convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n$4$. We are given that $S$ is also compact. Thus, $S$ is a compact, convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n$5$. We now analyze the implications of $S$ being a submanifold without boundary. Let the dimension of $S$ as a submanifold be $k$.\n    - If $k=0$, then $S$ is a discrete set of points. Since $S$ is given as connected, it must consist of a single point. A single point is a compact, convex set and a $0$-dimensional submanifold without boundary. Let's say $S=\\{p_0\\}$. This is a consistent possibility.\n    - Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $k \\ge 1$. Since $S$ is a compact, convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with dimension $k \\ge 1$, it must have a non-empty topological boundary, $\\partial_{top}S$, within the affine subspace it spans, unless it is the entire affine subspace. But an affine subspace of dimension $k \\ge 1$ is not compact. Therefore, $S$ must be a bounded set with a non-empty boundary in its affine hull. For example, if $k=1$, $S$ must be a line segment $[p,q]$; if $k=2$, $S$ might be a filled polygon, and so on.\n    - A standard result in differential geometry states that a compact, convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^k$ with a non-empty interior is a $k$-manifold with boundary. For instance, the closed line segment $[p,q]$ is a $1$-manifold with boundary $\\{p,q\\}$. A closed disk in a plane is a $2$-manifold with boundary (a circle).\n    - In general, any compact, convex set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $k \\ge 1$ is a topological $k$-manifold with boundary. The boundary of the manifold $S$ coincides with its topological boundary relative to its affine hull.\n    - This contradicts the given condition that $S$ is a submanifold *without boundary*. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to reject the assumption that $k \\ge 1$.\n\n$6$. The only remaining possibility is $k=0$. As argued before, a connected $0$-dimensional manifold is a single point. Therefore, $S$ must be a single point.\n\nThe soul theorem applies to complete, non-compact Riemannian manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature. The manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ is complete, non-compact, and has sectional curvature $K=0$, satisfying the conditions. The theorem asserts the existence of a soul, which is a compact, totally convex submanifold $S$ such that the manifold is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$. We have just demonstrated that any such soul for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be a point. For simplicity and convenience, we can choose this point to be the origin, $S = \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Part 2: Normal Bundle and Normal Exponential Map**\n\nWe are asked to identify the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$ and derive the formula for the normal exponential map $\\exp^{\\perp} \\colon \\nu(S) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, for the soul $S = \\{0\\}$.\n\n$1$. The soul is $S = \\{0\\}$, a $0$-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The base space of the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$ is the single point $\\{0\\}$.\n\n$2$. The tangent space to $S$ at the point $0$ is the zero-dimensional vector space, $T_{0}S = \\{0\\}$.\n\n$3$. The tangent space to the ambient manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ at the point $0$ is $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is canonically isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ itself.\n\n$4$. The fiber of the normal bundle at the point $0 \\in S$, denoted $\\nu_{0}(S)$, is the orthogonal complement of $T_{0}S$ within $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n$$ \\nu_{0}(S) = (T_{0}S)^{\\perp} \\text{ in } T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} $$\nSubstituting $T_{0}S = \\{0\\}$, we get:\n$$ \\nu_{0}(S) = (\\{0\\})^{\\perp} = T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n} $$\nThe orthogonal complement of the zero subspace is the entire space.\n\n$5$. Since the base space $S$ is just a single point, the total space of the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$ is simply this single fiber. Thus, $\\nu(S) = \\nu_{0}(S) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. An element of $\\nu(S)$ can be represented as a pair $(0, v)$ where $v \\in T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We can identify this element simply by the vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n$6$. We now derive the formula for the normal exponential map, $\\exp^{\\perp} \\colon \\nu(S) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The definition provided is $\\exp^{\\perp}(x, w) = \\exp_{x}(w)$, where $x \\in S$ and $w \\in \\nu_{x}(S)$.\n\n$7$. In our case, $x=0$ and the vector in the normal-bundle fiber is $v \\in T_0 \\mathbb{R}^n$. So we must compute:\n$$ \\exp^{\\perp}(0, v) = \\exp_{0}(v) $$\n\n$8$. The problem statement specifies that for $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$, the exponential map is given by $\\exp_{p}(v) = p+v$.\n\n$9$. Setting $p=0$, we obtain the explicit formula for the exponential map at the origin:\n$$ \\exp_{0}(v) = 0 + v = v $$\n\n$10$. Therefore, the normal exponential map, which maps an element of $\\nu(S)$ identified by $v \\in T_0\\mathbb{R}^n$ to a point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, is given by:\n$$ \\exp^{\\perp}(v) = v $$\nThis map is the identity map from $\\nu(S) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is indeed a diffeomorphism, as predicted by the soul theorem.\n\nThe two requested pieces of information are the chosen soul, $S=\\{0\\}$, and the formula for the value of the normal exponential map, $\\exp^{\\perp}(v) = v$.

So, $f'(0) = \\operatorname{sech}^2(0) = (1/\\cosh(0))^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\nThe conditions are satisfied. The Cheeger–Gromoll Soul Theorem is a fundamental result in geometric analysis. The tasks are logically structured and a unique conclusion is expected. The problem is free of scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Verification of Nonnegative Curvature**\n\nFor a surface of revolution with a metric of the form $g = dr^{2} + f(r)^{2}\\, d\\theta^{2}$, the Gaussian curvature $K$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nK = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}\n$$\nWe are given the function $f(r) = \\tanh(r)$. We compute its first and second derivatives.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\nf'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\tanh(r) = \\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\n$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\nf''(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r) = 2\\operatorname{sech}(r) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dr}\\operatorname{sech}(r) = 2\\operatorname{sech}(r) \\cdot (-\\operatorname{sech}(r)\\tanh(r)) = -2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\\tanh(r)\n$$\nNow, we substitute $f(r)$ and $f''(r)$ into the formula for the Gaussian curvature. For $r > 0$, $\\tanh(r) \\neq 0$, so we have:\n$$\nK(r) = -\\frac{-2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\\tanh(r)}{\\tanh(r)} = 2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\n$$\nThe hyperbolic secant function is defined as $\\operatorname{sech}(r) = 1/\\cosh(r)$. Since $\\cosh(r) \\ge 1$ for all real $r$, $\\operatorname{sech}(r)$ is always positive. Therefore, $\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)$ is strictly positive for all $r \\in [0, \\infty)$.\nThis means that $K(r) = 2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r) > 0$ for all $r \\in [0, \\infty)$.\nConsequently, the condition $K \\ge 0$ is satisfied everywhere on $M$.\n\n**Part 2: Existence of a Geodesic Parallel**\n\nA parallel circle, which is a curve of constant radius $r = r_{0}$, is a geodesic if and only if its geodesic curvature, $\\kappa_{g}$, is zero. For a surface of revolution with the given metric, the geodesic curvature of a parallel at $r=r_0$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\kappa_{g}(r_{0}) = \\frac{f'(r_{0})}{f(r_{0})}\n$$\nFor a parallel $\\{r=r_0\\}$ with $r_0 > 0$ to be a geodesic, we require $\\kappa_{g}(r_{0}) = 0$. This implies:\n$$\n\\frac{f'(r_{0})}{f(r_{0})} = 0\n$$\nSince $r_{0} > 0$, we have $f(r_{0}) = \\tanh(r_{0}) \\neq 0$. Thus, the condition for the parallel to be a geodesic simplifies to $f'(r_{0}) = 0$.\nFrom Part 1, we calculated the derivative to be $f'(r) = \\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)$. We need to solve for $r_0 > 0$ such that:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r_{0}) = 0\n$$\nAs established before, $\\operatorname{sech}(r_{0}) = 1/\\cosh(r_{0})$ is never zero for any finite real value of $r_{0}$. Therefore, there is no value of $r_{0} > 0$ for which $f'(r_{0})=0$.\nWe conclude that there exists no parallel circle $\\{r=r_{0}\\}$ with $r_{0}>0$ that is a closed geodesic in $M$.\n\n**Part 3: Identification of the Soul**\n\nThe problem states that $M$ is a complete, noncompact Riemannian surface. In Part 1, we verified that its Gaussian curvature satisfies $K \\ge 0$. The Cheeger–Gromoll Soul Theorem applies to such manifolds. It guarantees the existence of a soul $S$, which is a compact, totally geodesic submanifold of $M$, such that $M$ is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of $S$.\n\nFor a $2$-dimensional manifold like $M$, a submanifold $S$ can have dimension $0$ or $1$.\n- If $\\dim(S) = 0$, the soul is a point. A point is trivially a totally geodesic submanifold.\n- If $\\dim(S) = 1$, the soul is a curve. Since the soul must be compact, it must be a closed curve. A $1$-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold is a geodesic. Therefore, a curve soul must be a closed geodesic.\n\nSo, the soul $S$ of $M$ must be either a point or a closed geodesic.\n\nThe manifold $M$ is rotationally symmetric, meaning the group of rotations $\\mathbb{S}^1$ (or $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$) acts on $M$ by isometries. If $S$ is a soul, then $\\phi(S)$ is also a soul. By the uniqueness of the soul (up to isometry), the soul $S$ must be an invariant set under the group of isometries.\n- If the soul is a point, it must be a fixed point of the rotational symmetry group. The only such point on the surface of revolution is the pole at $r=0$.\n- If the soul is a closed curve, it must be an orbit of the rotation group. The orbits are the parallel circles $\\{r=r_0\\}$ for $r_0 > 0$.\n\nCombining these facts, the soul must be either the point at $r=0$ or a parallel circle $\\{r=r_0\\}$ that is also a closed geodesic.\nIn Part 2, we proved that no parallel circle $\\{r=r_{0}\\}$ for $r_{0}>0$ is a geodesic. This eliminates the possibility of the soul being a closed curve.\nThe only remaining possibility is that the soul is the point at $r=0$.\n\nThe problem defines a diagnostic value $d$ such that $d=0$ if the soul is a point and $d=1$ if the soul is a closed geodesic. Since we have determined that the soul is the point at $r=0$, the diagnostic value is $d=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3075268"}, {"introduction": "Major theorems in geometry often rest on crucial hypotheses.

Analysis of the Manifold $(M,g)$**\n\nFirst, let's establish the properties of $(M,g) = (\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus K, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}|_M)$. We assume $n \\ge 2$, as for $n=1$, $M$ would not be connected.\n\n*   **Sectional Curvature**: $M$ is an open subset of the Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$. The Euclidean metric has a vanishing Riemann curvature tensor. The metric $g$ on $M$ is the restriction of $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$, so its curvature tensor is also identically zero. Therefore, the sectional curvature of $(M,g)$ is identically $0$, which is nonnegative.\n*   **Connectedness**: For $n \\ge 2$, removing a collection of disjoint balls and a single point from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ leaves a path-connected space. Thus, $M$ is connected.\n*   **Noncompactness**: $M$ is an unbounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so it is noncompact.\n*   **Completeness**: A Riemannian manifold is metrically complete if every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the manifold. Consider a sequence of points $\\{p_j\\}_{j=1}^\\infty$ in $M$ that converges to the origin $0$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For example, one can choose a sequence of points on a line segment approaching $0$ that avoids all the balls $\\overline{B}(x_i, r_i)$. Since the metric $g$ on $M$ is induced by the Euclidean metric, the distance between points in $M$ is the Euclidean distance. Therefore, the sequence $\\{p_j\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M,g)$. However, its limit point is $0$, and by definition, $0 \\in K$, so $0 \\notin M$. This means we have found a Cauchy sequence in $M$ that does not converge to a point in $M$. Consequently, the manifold $(M,g)$ is **not complete**.\n\nIn summary, $(M,g)$ is a connected, noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature ($K \\ge 0$). It satisfies all hypotheses of the Soul Theorem except for completeness.\n\n**2. Testing the Conclusion of the Soul Theorem**\n\nThe conclusion of the Soul Theorem states that $M$ must be diffeomorphic to the total space of a normal bundle over a compact, totally geodesic submanifold $S$ (the soul). Let's call this total space $E$.\n\nA key topological property, explicitly recalled in the problem statement, is that if $E \\to S$ is a vector bundle over a compact base manifold $S$, then $E$ is homotopy equivalent to $S$. A compact manifold like $S$ has finitely generated homology groups $H_k(S; \\mathbb{Z})$ for all degrees $k$. Since homology is a homotopy invariant, the homology groups of $E$, $H_k(E; \\mathbb{Z})$, must also be finitely generated.\n\nIf the conclusion of the Soul Theorem were to hold for our manifold $M$, then $M$ would be diffeomorphic, and therefore homotopy equivalent, to such a space $E$. This would imply that the homology groups of $M$, $H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, must be finitely generated for all $k$.\n\nThe strategy is to compute a homology group of $M$ and show it is not finitely generated. This would prove that $M$ cannot be homotopy equivalent to any compact manifold, and thus cannot be diffeomorphic to the total space of a normal bundle over a compact soul.\n\n**3. Homology Calculation**\n\nWe need to compute the homology of $M = \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus K$. The problem suggests a path using Alexander Duality.\n\n*   The set to be removed is $K = \\{0\\} \\cup \\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty \\overline{B}(x_i, r_i)$. The path components of $K$ are the singleton set $\\{0\\}$ and each individual closed ball $\\overline{B}(x_i, r_i)$. Since there are infinitely many such balls, $K$ has a countably infinite number of path components.\n*   We now compute the reduced $0$-th cohomology of $K$, $\\tilde{H}^0(K; \\mathbb{Z})$. The group $H^0(K; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the group of functions from the set of path components of $K$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Since there are infinitely many path components, this is the direct product of countably many copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$. The reduced cohomology $\\tilde{H}^0(K; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the kernel of the augmentation map, which is a free abelian group of rank one less than the number of path components. With infinitely many path components, $\\tilde{H}^0(K; \\mathbb{Z})$ has infinite rank; it is not finitely generated.\n*   The problem provides two further facts to connect this to the homology of $M$: Alexander Duality in $S^n$ and a relation between the homology of $M$ and the homology of $S^n \\setminus K$.\n    *   Treating $K$ as a compact subset of $S^n$ (via the one-point compactification $\\mathbb{R}^n \\cup \\{\\infty\\} = S^n$), Alexander Duality states $\\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^n \\setminus K) \\cong \\tilde{H}^{n-(n-1)-1}(K) = \\tilde{H}^0(K)$.\n    *   The problem then states that for $i \\ge 1$, $H_i(M) \\cong \\tilde{H}_i(S^n \\setminus K)$. This is a standard result, noting $M = \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus K$ and $S^n \\setminus K$ is its one-point compactification.\n*   Combining these facts: $H_{n-1}(M) \\cong \\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^n \\setminus K) \\cong \\tilde{H}^0(K)$. (For $n \\ge 2$, $n-1 \\ge 1$, so $H_{n-1}(M) \\cong \\tilde{H}_{n-1}(M)$).\n*   Since $\\tilde{H}^0(K)$ is not finitely generated, it follows that $H_{n-1}(M)$ is not finitely generated.\n\nThis result contradicts the necessary condition for $M$ to be diffeomorphic to the total space of a normal bundle over a compact soul. Therefore, the conclusion of the Soul Theorem fails for $(M,g)$. This demonstrates that the completeness hypothesis is essential.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $(M,g)$ has nonnegative sectional curvature and is complete by the Hopf–Rinow theorem, but it is not diffeomorphic to a normal bundle over any compact set because its boundary is not smooth.**\nThis option claims that $(M,g)$ is complete. As demonstrated above, $(M,g)$ is **not** complete. The Hopf-Rinow theorem establishes an equivalence between metric completeness and geodesic completeness for a connected Riemannian manifold; it does not prove that this particular manifold is complete. This fundamental error invalidates the option.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. $(M,g)$ has sectional curvature $K\\equiv 0$ and is not complete. Moreover, letting $K\\subset S^n$ denote the same compact closed subset (viewed inside $S^n$ via the one-point compactification), Alexander duality gives $\\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^n\\setminus K)\\cong \\tilde{H}^0(K)$, and since $K$ has countably infinitely many path components, $\\tilde{H}^0(K)$ has countably infinite rank. For $i\\ge 1$, $\\tilde{H}_i(S^n\\setminus K)\\cong H_i(M)$, so $H_{n-1}(M)$ has infinite rank. Because the total space of a normal bundle over a compact manifold is homotopy equivalent to the base and thus has finitely generated homology, $M$ cannot be diffeomorphic to any such normal bundle. This shows completeness is essential.**\nThis option correctly identifies that $(M,g)$ has sectional curvature $K\\equiv 0$ and is not complete. It then lays out precisely the argument derived above: it uses Alexander duality to relate the homology of the manifold's one-point compactification to the cohomology of the removed set $K$, correctly deduces that $K$'s infinitely many components lead to an infinitely-generated homology group for $M$, and correctly concludes that this prevents $M$ from being diffeomorphic to a normal bundle over a compact soul. The logic is sound and all steps are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. $(M,g)$ has negative sectional curvature near the deleted balls, so the Soul Theorem fails regardless of completeness assumptions.**\nThis option claims $(M,g)$ has negative sectional curvature. This is false. As an open submanifold of Euclidean space with the restricted metric, its sectional curvature is identically zero everywhere.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $(M,g)$ has nonnegative sectional curvature and is not complete, but it is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle over a compact set with infinitely many components, so completeness is not needed.**\nThis option correctly states that $(M,g)$ has nonnegative curvature and is not complete. However, it incorrectly claims that $M$ **is** diffeomorphic to a normal bundle over a \"compact set with infinitely many components\". First, the soul $S$ in the theorem is a compact *manifold*, which must have a finite number of connected components. Second, and more critically, our derivation proved that $M$ cannot be diffeomorphic (or even homotopy equivalent) to a normal bundle over any compact base due to its infinitely generated homology. The conclusion that completeness is not needed is therefore false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3077671"}]}
