We will proceed to solve it in two parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we must justify that the curve $\\gamma(t) = p + t v$ is a geodesic on the Riemannian manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$, where $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric. A curve $\\gamma$ is a geodesic if and only if its covariant acceleration vanishes, i.e., $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)}\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Here, $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ is the tangent vector to the curve, and $\\nabla$ denotes the Levi–Civita connection associated with the metric $g$.\n\nIn standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the standard Euclidean metric $g$ has components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ (the Kronecker delta). The Christoffel symbols of the first kind are given by $\\Gamma_{ijk} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_i g_{jk} + \\partial_j g_{ik} - \\partial_k g_{ij})$. Since the components $g_{ij}$ are constant, all their partial derivatives are zero, which implies that all Christoffel symbols of the first kind are zero. Consequently, the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = g^{kl}\\Gamma_{lij}$, are also identically zero for all $i, j, k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nThe covariant acceleration of a curve $\\gamma(t)$ has components given by\n$$ (\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma})^k = \\frac{d^2\\gamma^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\Gamma_{ij}^k \\frac{d\\gamma^i}{dt}\\frac{d\\gamma^j}{dt} $$\nwhere $\\gamma^k(t)$ is the $k$-th component of the curve in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nFor the given curve $\\gamma(t) = p + t v$, let the components of the constant vectors $p$ and $v$ be $p^k$ and $v^k$, respectively. The $k$-th component of the curve is $\\gamma^k(t) = p^k + t v^k$.\nThe velocity vector (tangent vector) has components:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}^k(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma^k}{dt} = v^k $$\nThe acceleration vector has components:\n$$ \\ddot{\\gamma}^k(t) = \\frac{d^2\\gamma^k}{dt^2} = 0 $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the covariant acceleration and recalling that $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$ for all $i,j,k$, we get:\n$$ (\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma})^k = 0 + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} (0) \\cdot v^i \\cdot v^j = 0 $$\nSince this holds for all components $k = 1, \\dots, n$, the covariant acceleration vector $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the zero vector. Thus, the curve $\\gamma(t) = p + t v$ is a geodesic in $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g)$.\n\nSecond, we compute the Riemannian distance $d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t))$ between two points on this geodesic, $\\gamma(s) = p + s v$ and $\\gamma(t) = p + t v$. The Riemannian distance $d(q_1, q_2)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting the points $q_1$ and $q_2$.\nThe length $L(\\alpha)$ of a piecewise smooth curve $\\alpha: [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the integral:\n$$ L(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g_{\\alpha(u)}(\\dot{\\alpha}(u), \\dot{\\alpha}(u))} \\, du $$\nFor the Euclidean metric, this simplifies to the standard arc length formula:\n$$ L(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\langle \\dot{\\alpha}(u), \\dot{\\alpha}(u) \\rangle} \\, du = \\int_a^b \\|\\dot{\\alpha}(u)\\| \\, du $$\nWe know that a geodesic is a locally distance-minimizing curve. In a complete, simply connected manifold with non-positive curvature, like Euclidean space, geodesics are globally distance-minimizing between any two of their points. Therefore, the distance between $\\gamma(s)$ and $\\gamma(t)$ is simply the length of the geodesic segment connecting them.\n\nLet's assume, without loss of generality, that $s \\le t$. The geodesic segment connecting $\\gamma(s)$ and $\\gamma(t)$ can be parametrized by the curve $\\gamma$ itself, with the parameter running from $s$ to $t$. Let this segment be denoted by $\\alpha(u) = \\gamma(u) = p + u v$ for $u \\in [s, t]$.\nThe tangent vector is $\\dot{\\alpha}(u) = v$.\nThe length of this segment is:\n$$ L(\\alpha) = \\int_s^t \\sqrt{\\langle \\dot{\\alpha}(u), \\dot{\\alpha}(u) \\rangle} \\, du = \\int_s^t \\sqrt{\\langle v, v \\rangle} \\, du $$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given that $v$ is a unit vector, so $\\langle v, v \\rangle = 1$.\n$$ L(\\alpha) = \\int_s^t \\sqrt{1} \\, du = \\int_s^t 1 \\, du = [u]_s^t = t - s $$\nTo confirm this is the infimum, consider any piecewise smooth path $\\beta: [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\beta(a) = \\gamma(s)$ and $\\beta(b) = \\gamma(t)$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals (also known as the triangle inequality for integrals), we have:\n$$ L(\\beta) = \\int_a^b \\|\\dot{\\beta}(u)\\| \\, du \\ge \\left\\| \\int_a^b \\dot{\\beta}(u) \\, du \\right\\| = \\|\\beta(b) - \\beta(a)\\| $$\nThe difference vector is:\n$$ \\beta(b) - \\beta(a) = \\gamma(t) - \\gamma(s) = (p + t v) - (p + s v) = (t-s)v $$\nSo, the norm is:\n$$ \\|\\beta(b) - \\beta(a)\\| = \\|(t-s)v\\| = |t-s| \\|v\\| = |t-s| \\sqrt{\\langle v, v \\rangle} = |t-s| \\cdot 1 = |t-s| $$\nThus, for any path $\\beta$ connecting $\\gamma(s)$ and $\\gamma(t)$, its length $L(\\beta) \\ge |t-s|$.\nSince we have found a path (the geodesic segment) whose length is exactly $|t-s|$ (as $t-s = |t-s|$ for our assumption $t \\ge s$), this value is the infimum.\nTherefore, the Riemannian distance is:\n$$ d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)) = |t-s| $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{|t-s|} $$", "id": "3067323"}, {"introduction": "With a solid understanding of what constitutes a line, we can now witness the Splitting Theorem in action.

It is a standard problem in Riemannian geometry.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four steps as requested by the prompt.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the distance function**\n\nLet $p_1 = (\\theta_1, t_1)$ and $p_2 = (\\theta_2, t_2)$ be two arbitrary points in the Riemannian product manifold $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, equipped with the product metric $g = g_{S^{1}} \\oplus dt^{2}$. The distance $d(p_1, p_2)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise differentiable curves connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$.\nLet $\\alpha: [a,b] \\to M$ be such a curve, written in terms of its component functions as $\\alpha(u) = (\\alpha_1(u), \\alpha_2(u))$, where $\\alpha_1: [a,b] \\to S^1$ and $\\alpha_2: [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The tangent vector is $\\alpha'(u) = (\\alpha_1'(u), \\alpha_2'(u))$. The length of $\\alpha$ is given by\n$$L(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\|\\alpha_1'(u)\\|_{g_{S^1}}^2 + |\\alpha_2'(u)|_{dt^2}^2} \\, du$$\nBy the Minkowski inequality for integrals (a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), we have:\n$$L(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\|\\alpha_1'(u)\\|^2 + |\\alpha_2'(u)|^2} \\, du \\ge \\sqrt{\\left(\\int_a^b \\|\\alpha_1'(u)\\| \\, du\\right)^2 + \\left(\\int_a^b |\\alpha_2'(u)| \\, du\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{L(\\alpha_1)^2 + L(\\alpha_2)^2}$$\nTaking the infimum over all curves $\\alpha$ connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$, we obtain a lower bound for the distance $d(p_1, p_2)$:\n$$d(p_1, p_2) = \\inf_{\\alpha} L(\\alpha) \\ge \\sqrt{(\\inf_{\\alpha_1} L(\\alpha_1))^2 + (\\inf_{\\alpha_2} L(\\alpha_2))^2} = \\sqrt{d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)^2 + d_{\\mathbb{R}}(t_1, t_2)^2}$$\nwhere $d_{S^1}$ and $d_{\\mathbb{R}}$ are the intrinsic distance functions on $S^1$ and $\\mathbb{R}$, respectively. The distance on $\\mathbb{R}$ is $d_{\\mathbb{R}}(t_1, t_2) = |t_1 - t_2|$.\n\nThis lower bound is achieved by a geodesic. In a product space, a curve $\\alpha(s) = (\\alpha_1(s), \\alpha_2(s))$ is a geodesic if and only if its components $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are geodesics (possibly after reparameterization). Let $\\gamma_1$ be a minimal geodesic in $S^1$ from $\\theta_1$ to $\\theta_2$ and $\\gamma_2$ be the unique minimal geodesic (a straight line segment) in $\\mathbb{R}$ from $t_1$ to $t_2$. Their lengths are $L_1 = d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ and $L_2 = |t_1 - t_2|$, respectively. A geodesic in $M$ connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$ can be constructed with length $\\sqrt{L_1^2 + L_2^2}$. Thus, the distance is precisely this value:\n$$d(p_1, p_2)^2 = d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)^2 + (t_1 - t_2)^2$$\nFor the problem at hand, we need the distance between a point $p = (\\theta, t)$ and a point on the ray $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta_0, s)$. Applying the derived formula:\n$$d(p, \\gamma(s)) = d\\big((\\theta,t),(\\theta_{0},s)\\big) = \\sqrt{d_{S^{1}}(\\theta, \\theta_{0})^2 + (t-s)^2}$$\n\n**Step 2: Computation of the Busemann function**\n\nThe forward Busemann function $b^{+}(p)$ is defined by the limit:\n$$b^{+}(p) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\big( d(p, \\gamma(s)) - s \\big)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the distance and the coordinates of $p=(\\theta,t)$:\n$$b^{+}(\\theta, t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\left( \\sqrt{d_{S^{1}}(\\theta, \\theta_{0})^2 + (t-s)^2} - s \\right)$$\nFor large $s$, we have $s > t$, so $(t-s)^2 = (s-t)^2$. Let $D = d_{S^{1}}(\\theta, \\theta_{0})$ be the constant distance on the circle. The limit is of the indeterminate form $\\infty - \\infty$. We multiply and divide by the conjugate expression:\n$$b^{+}(\\theta, t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{D^2 + (s-t)^2} - s\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{D^2 + (s-t)^2} + s\\right)}{\\sqrt{D^2 + (s-t)^2} + s}$$\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{D^2 + (s-t)^2 - s^2}{\\sqrt{D^2 + s^2 - 2st + t^2} + s}$$\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{D^2 + s^2 - 2st + t^2 - s^2}{\\sqrt{s^2\\left(\\frac{D^2+t^2}{s^2} - \\frac{2t}{s} + 1\\right)} + s}$$\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{D^2 + t^2 - 2st}{s\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2t}{s} + \\frac{D^2+t^2}{s^2}} + s}$$\nWe divide the numerator and the denominator by $s$:\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{D^2+t^2}{s} - 2t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2t}{s} + \\frac{D^2+t^2}{s^2}} + 1}$$\nTaking the limit as $s \\to \\infty$, the terms with $s$ in the denominator go to $0$:\n$$= \\frac{0 - 2t}{\\sqrt{1 - 0 + 0} + 1} = \\frac{-2t}{1+1} = -t$$\nThus, the Busemann function is $b^{+}(\\theta, t) = -t$.\n\n**Step 3: Verification that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u) = (\\theta_{0}, u)$ is a line**\n\nA line is a complete geodesic that minimizes the distance between any two of its points.\n1.  **Geodesic property**: The curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u)$ has component curves $\\alpha_1(u) = \\theta_0$ and $\\alpha_2(u) = u$. The first component, a constant point, is a trivial geodesic in $S^1$. The second component is a straight line with constant speed parameterization, which is a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u)$ is a geodesic in the product manifold $M$.\n2.  **Completeness**: The curve is defined for all $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so it is a complete geodesic.\n3.  **Minimizing property**: Let $p_1 = \\tilde{\\gamma}(u_1) = (\\theta_0, u_1)$ and $p_2 = \\tilde{\\gamma}(u_2) = (\\theta_0, u_2)$ be two points on the curve. The Riemannian distance between them is:\n    $$d(p_1, p_2) = \\sqrt{d_{S^1}(\\theta_0, \\theta_0)^2 + (u_1-u_2)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (u_1-u_2)^2} = |u_1 - u_2|$$\n    The arc length of the segment of $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ between $u_1$ and $u_2$ is found by integrating its speed. The tangent vector is $\\tilde{\\gamma}'(u) = (0,1)$, so its speed is $\\|\\tilde{\\gamma}'(u)\\|_g = \\sqrt{\\|0\\|_{g_{S^1}}^2 + |1|^2} = 1$. The arc length is $\\int_{u_1}^{u_2} 1 \\, du = u_2 - u_1 = |u_2 - u_1|$ (for $u_2 \\ge u_1$).\n    Since the arc length along the geodesic segment equals the Riemannian distance between its endpoints, $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is a minimizing geodesic.\nThus, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u)$ is a line.\n\n**Step 4: Gradient of $b^{+}$ and the Splitting Theorem**\n\nWe found that $b^{+}(\\theta, t) = -t$. Let the local coordinate for $S^1$ be $\\phi$. Then $b^{+}(\\phi,t)=-t$. The metric in these coordinates is $g = d\\phi^2 + dt^2$, so the metric tensor is $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The gradient $\\nabla b^{+}$ is the vector field dual to the $1$-form $db^{+}$. In coordinates, $(\\nabla b^{+})^i = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x^j}$.\n$$db^{+} = \\frac{\\partial(-t)}{\\partial \\phi}d\\phi + \\frac{\\partial(-t)}{\\partial t}dt = 0 \\cdot d\\phi - 1 \\cdot dt = -dt$$\nThe dual vector field is $\\nabla b^{+} = g^{\\phi j}\\partial_j b^{+} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + g^{t j}\\partial_j b^{+} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = g^{tt} (-1) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 1 \\cdot (-1) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\nThe norm of the gradient is $\\|\\nabla b^{+}\\| = \\sqrt{g(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t})} = \\sqrt{g_{tt}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. It is a unit vector field.\n\nA vector field $V$ is parallel if its covariant derivative $\\nabla V$ is zero. In the coordinates $(\\phi, t)$, the metric components $g_{ij}$ are constant, which implies all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero. The components of $\\nabla b^{+} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ are constant ($V^\\phi=0, V^t=-1$). The covariant derivative of $V$ is given by $(\\nabla_k V^i) \\partial_i = (\\partial_k V^i + \\Gamma^i_{kj}V^j)\\partial_i$. Since $\\partial_k V^i=0$ and $\\Gamma^i_{kj}=0$, the covariant derivative is zero. Hence, $\\nabla b^{+}$ is a parallel unit vector field.\n\nThe Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem states that any complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with non-negative Ricci curvature ($Ric \\ge 0$) that contains a line must split isometrically as a product $M \\cong N \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n- Our manifold $M=S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is complete.\n- We have demonstrated it contains a line $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u) = (\\theta_0, u)$.\n- The Ricci curvature of a product is the direct sum of the Ricci curvatures of its factors.

Thus, $Ric_M \\equiv 0$, which satisfies the condition $Ric \\ge 0$.\n\nAll conditions of the theorem are met. The existence of a line gives rise to the function $b^{+}$, whose gradient is a parallel unit vector field. This field, $\\nabla b^{+} = -\\partial/\\partial t$, generates the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor in the splitting. The integral curves of $\\nabla b^{+}$ are the vertical lines $(\\text{const}, t)$, and the orthogonal hypersurfaces are the level sets of $b^{+}$, i.e., $t=\\text{const}$, which are copies of $S^1$.

For points on a great circle separated by arc length exceeding $\\pi$ times the radius, there exist shorter paths (and conjugate points occur), so $d(\\gamma(s),\\gamma(t))$ is not equal to the arc length of the intervening segment for all $s,t$.\n- Thus, the premise in the option is doubly wrong: $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is positive, and great circles are not lines in the sense of being globally minimizing.\n\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: A product $\\mathbb{R}\\times N$ with product metric where $(N,h)$ has strictly negative Ricci curvature.\n- Ricci curvature of the product: In a Riemannian product, the Ricci tensor splits as a block diagonal sum; along the $\\mathbb{R}$ direction, $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is $0$, and along directions tangent to $N$, it equals $\\operatorname{Ric}_{N}$. Therefore, the product cannot have $\\operatorname{Ric}0$ in all directions because vectors tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor have $\\operatorname{Ric}=0$. Hence the claim of strictly negative Ricci curvature everywhere is false.\n- Lines: The product does contain lines along the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor.\n- Explanation of failure: The option claims the product has strictly negative Ricci curvature even in $\\mathbb{R}$ directions, which is incorrect. Moreover, the manifold is already a product, so “failure of splitting” is not demonstrated; rather, splitting trivially holds.\n\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct choice is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3067310"}]}
