Express your final result for $N_{J}$ as a single closed-form analytical expression, with no units and no inequalities.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in differential geometry concerning the integrability of an almost complex structure.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Nijenhuis tensor $N_{J}$ for the standard almost complex structure $J$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, and to verify that it vanishes identically. The space $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is endowed with real coordinates $(x^{1},\\dots,x^{n},y^{1},\\dots,y^{n})$ corresponding to the complex coordinates $z^{k}=x^{k}+\\mathrm{i}y^{k}$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The almost complex structure $J$ is a $(1,1)$-tensor field defined by its action on the coordinate basis vector fields:\n$$ J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}\\right)=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}} $$\n$$ J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}} $$\nFrom this definition, it immediately follows that for any vector field $V$, $J(J(V)) = -V$, thus $J^{2}=-I$, which is the defining property of an almost complex structure.\n\nThe Nijenhuis tensor $N_{J}$ associated with an almost complex structure $J$ is a tensor field of type $(1,2)$ that measures the integrability of $J$. It is defined for any two smooth vector fields $X$ and $Y$ by the formula:\n$$ N_{J}(X, Y) = [JX, JY] - J[JX, Y] - J[X, JY] - [X, Y] $$\nHere, $[ \\cdot, \\cdot ]$ denotes the Lie bracket of vector fields. A fundamental property of the Nijenhuis tensor is that it is, in fact, a tensor field. This means it is $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{C}^{n})$-linear in each of its arguments. For any smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{C}^{n})$, $N_J(fX, Y) = f N_J(X, Y)$ and $N_J(X, fY) = f N_J(X, Y)$.\n\nThis tensorial property implies that to determine if $N_{J}$ vanishes identically, it is sufficient to compute its components on a basis of vector fields. If $N_{J}$ is zero for all pairs of basis vector fields, its $C^{\\infty}$-linearity guarantees that it will be zero for any arbitrary pair of vector fields $X$ and $Y$.\n\nWe shall use the coordinate basis vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, which we denote for brevity as $\\partial_{x^k} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}$ and $\\partial_{y^k} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}$. A crucial property of these coordinate vector fields in a standard chart on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is that they all commute. That is, the Lie bracket of any two of these basis vector fields is zero:\n$$ [\\partial_{x^k}, \\partial_{x^j}] = 0 $$\n$$ [\\partial_{y^k}, \\partial_{y^j}] = 0 $$\n$$ [\\partial_{x^k}, \\partial_{y^j}] = 0 $$\nfor all $k, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nLet us now evaluate $N_{J}$ on arbitrary pairs of these basis vectors. Let $E_i$ and $E_j$ be any two vector fields from the basis $\\{\\partial_{x^1}, \\dots, \\partial_{x^n}, \\partial_{y^1}, \\dots, \\partial_{y^n}\\}$.\nWe compute each term in the definition of $N_J(E_i, E_j)$:\n\n1.  The term $[E_i, E_j]$: As established, the Lie bracket of any two coordinate basis vectors is zero. So, $[E_i, E_j] = 0$.\n\n2.  The term $J[E_i, J E_j]$: The action of $J$ on any basis vector $E_j$ results in another basis vector, possibly with a sign change. For example, $J(\\partial_{x^j}) = \\partial_{y^j}$ and $J(\\partial_{y^j}) = -\\partial_{x^j}$. In general, $J E_j$ is a linear combination of basis vectors with constant coefficients (specifically, one of the coefficients is $\\pm 1$ and the others are $0$). Let's denote $J E_j = E_k$ (up to a sign). Then $[E_i, J E_j]$ is the Lie bracket of two basis vectors, which is $0$. Therefore, $J[E_i, J E_j] = J(0) = 0$.\n\n3.  The term $J[J E_i, E_j]$: By the same reasoning as in the previous point, $J E_i$ is a basis vector (up to a sign). Thus, $[J E_i, E_j]$ is the Lie bracket of two basis vectors, which is $0$. Therefore, $J[J E_i, E_j] = J(0) = 0$.\n\n4.  The term $[J E_i, J E_j]$: Again, $J E_i$ and $J E_j$ are basis vectors (up to signs). The Lie bracket is bilinear, so $[J E_i, J E_j]$ is the Lie bracket of two basis vectors (with a coefficient of $\\pm 1$), which is $0$.\n\nCombining these results, we find that for any pair of basis vector fields $E_i, E_j$:\n$$ N_J(E_i, E_j) = [J E_i, J E_j] - J[J E_i, E_j] - J[E_i, J E_j] - [E_i, E_j] = 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = 0 $$\n\nSince $N_J$ vanishes for all pairs of basis vector fields, and given that $N_J$ is a tensor, we conclude that $N_J(X, Y) = 0$ for all smooth vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. The Nijenhuis tensor for the standard almost complex structure on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ vanishes identically. This proves that the standard almost complex structure on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is integrable, which is the well-known Newlander-Nirenberg theorem, and confirms that $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with this structure is indeed a complex manifold. The problem's requirement to verify the vanishing of $N_{J}$ is thus satisfied.

The term $\\frac{2\\bar{z}^{i}\\bar{z}^{k}z^{l}}{S^3}$ contains a factor $z^l$. When we differentiate with respect to $\\bar{z}^j$, this factor remains unless $n=0$. Thus, every term in the derivative will contain at least one factor of $z$ or $\\bar{z}$, causing it to vanish at $z=0$.\n\nCombining the non-zero terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} g_{k\\bar{l}}}{\\partial z^{i}\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}\\Big|_{z=0} = -\\delta_{kl}\\delta_{ij} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj}\n$$\nSubstituting into the simplified curvature formula:\n$$\nR_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}(0) = -(-\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj}) = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj}\n$$\nNow we compute the holomorphic sectional curvature $H_{g^{\\mathrm{FS}}}(v)$ at $z=0$. The denominator is:\n$$\n\\big(g_{i\\bar{j}}(0)v^{i}\\bar{v}^{j}\\big)^{2} = \\big(\\delta_{ij}v^{i}\\bar{v}^{j}\\big)^{2} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n |v^i|^2\\right)^2 = (|v|^2)^2\n$$\nThe numerator is $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}(0)v^{i}\\bar{v}^{j}v^{k}\\bar{v}^{l}$:\n$$\n(\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj})v^{i}\\bar{v}^{j}v^{k}\\bar{v}^{l} = (\\delta_{ij}v^{i}\\bar{v}^{j})(\\delta_{kl}v^{k}\\bar{v}^{l}) + (\\delta_{il}v^{i}\\bar{v}^{l})(\\delta_{kj}v^{k}\\bar{v}^{j})\n$$\nThe first term is $(\\sum_i v^i \\bar{v}^i)(\\sum_k v^k \\bar{v}^k) = |v|^2 |v|^2 = (|v|^2)^2$.\nThe second term is $(\\sum_l v^l \\bar{v}^l)(\\sum_j v^j \\bar{v}^j) = |v|^2 |v|^2 = (|v|^2)^2$.\nSo, the numerator is $(|v|^2)^2 + (|v|^2)^2 = 2(|v|^2)^2$.\n\nThe holomorphic sectional curvature is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$\nH_{g^{\\mathrm{FS}}}(v) = \\frac{2(|v|^2)^2}{(|v|^2)^2} = 2\n$$\nAs argued, this value is constant over $\\mathbb{CP}^n$.\n\nThe two computed values for the holomorphic sectional curvature are $0$ for $\\mathbb{C}^n$ and $2$ for $\\mathbb{CP}^n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3054562"}]}
