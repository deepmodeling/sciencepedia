The derivation must rely on the foundational definitions of complex differential geometry.\n\nFirst, we establish the definition of the Kähler form $\\omega$ derived from a Kähler potential $\\phi$. On a complex manifold, a Kähler form is a real, closed $(1,1)$-form that is positive definite. Given a real-valued smooth function $\\phi$, which serves as the potential, the associated two-form is constructed using the Dolbeault operators $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$. A standard definition, which we adopt here, is:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\phi\n$$\nThis normalization is chosen such that for the given potential on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, it yields the standard flat Kähler form. The exterior derivative on a complex manifold decomposes as $d = \\partial + \\bar{\\partial}$.\n\nThe given Kähler potential is $\\phi: \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, defined as $\\phi(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |z_k|^2$. Using the complex coordinates $z_k$ and their conjugates $\\bar{z}_k$, we can write $|z_k|^2 = z_k \\bar{z}_k$. Thus, the potential is:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\bar{z}_j\n$$\nOur derivation proceeds in two main steps: first, we compute the term $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$, and second, we verify that the resulting form $\\omega$ is closed.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Kähler form $\\omega$**\n\nWe begin by applying the operator $\\bar{\\partial}$ to the potential $\\phi$. For a smooth function $f$, the action of $\\bar{\\partial}$ is defined in local coordinates as:\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} f = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nApplying this to $\\phi$, we first compute the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\bar{z}_j \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\frac{\\partial \\bar{z}_j}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\delta_{jk} = z_k\n$$\nHere, $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this result into the expression for $\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$, we obtain a $(0,1)$-form:\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} \\phi = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} z_k d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nNext, we apply the operator $\\partial$ to the resulting $1$-form $\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$. For a general $p$-form $\\alpha$, the action of $\\partial$ follows the graded Leibniz rule. Applying this to $\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$:\n$$\n\\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = \\partial \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} z_k d\\bar{z}_k \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\partial(z_k d\\bar{z}_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left( (\\partial z_k) \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k + z_k \\wedge \\partial(d\\bar{z}_k) \\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate each term in the sum. The first term involves $\\partial z_k$. Applying the definition $\\partial f = \\sum_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_j} dz_j$:\n$$\n\\partial z_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial z_k}{\\partial z_j} dz_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\delta_{kj} dz_j = dz_k\n$$\nThe second term involves $\\partial(d\\bar{z}_k)$. We use the identity $\\partial\\bar{\\partial} + \\bar{\\partial}\\partial = 0$. We can write $d\\bar{z}_k = \\bar{\\partial}\\bar{z}_k$. Since $\\partial \\bar{z}_k = 0$, we have $\\partial(d\\bar{z}_k) = \\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\bar{z}_k) = -\\bar{\\partial}(\\partial\\bar{z}_k) = -\\bar{\\partial}(0) = 0$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi)$:\n$$\n\\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left( dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k + z_k \\wedge 0 \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nThis is a $(1,1)$-form, as expected. Now we can write the final expression for the Kähler form $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\phi = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nThis form is the standard flat Kähler form on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. For completeness, we can express it in real coordinates $z_k = x_k + i y_k$, $d z_k = d x_k + i d y_k$, $d\\bar{z}_k = d x_k - i d y_k$.\n$$\ndz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k = (dx_k + i dy_k) \\wedge (dx_k - i dy_k) = -i dx_k \\wedge dy_k + i dy_k \\wedge dx_k = -2i dx_k \\wedge dy_k\n$$\nSo, $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-2i \\, dx_k \\wedge dy_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dx_k \\wedge dy_k$, which is the standard symplectic form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\n**Step 2: Verification that $\\omega$ is closed**\n\nThe problem requires verification that $d\\omega = 0$. We will demonstrate this using the properties of the exterior derivative and Dolbeault operators. The form $\\omega$ is defined as $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2}\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$.\nThe fundamental identity $d^2 = 0$ implies $\\partial^2=0$, $\\bar{\\partial}^2=0$, and $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}+\\bar{\\partial}\\partial=0$. We have $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} d(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi)$, because $d(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = (\\partial+\\bar{\\partial})\\bar{\\partial}\\phi = \\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi + \\bar{\\partial}^2\\phi = \\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$.\nApplying $d$ to $\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = d \\left( \\frac{i}{2} d(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) \\right) = \\frac{i}{2} d^2(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\omega$ is closed.
