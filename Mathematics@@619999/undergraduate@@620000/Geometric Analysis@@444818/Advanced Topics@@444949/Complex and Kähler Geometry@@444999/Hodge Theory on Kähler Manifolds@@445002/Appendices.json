Calculation of $\\partial K$**\n\nBy definition, $\\partial K = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial z^{k}} \\, dz^{k}$. We first compute the partial derivatives of $K$ with respect to $z^{k}$. In Wirtinger calculus, $z^j$ and $\\bar{z}^j$ are treated as independent variables.

We compute the partial derivatives of $K$ with respect to $\\bar{z}^{k}$.

We apply this to $K$. From our previous calculation, we have $\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{k}} = z^{k}$. We now differentiate this with respect to $z^{j}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 K}{\\partial z^{j} \\partial \\bar{z}^{k}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{j}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{k}} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{j}} (z^{k}) = \\delta_{jk}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}K$:\n$$\n\\partial\\bar{\\partial} K = \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} \\delta_{jk} \\, dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\omega$ by multiplying by $i$:\n$$\n\\omega = i \\, \\partial\\bar{\\partial} K = i \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}\n$$\n\n**4. Identification with the Standard Flat Kähler Form**\n\nTo identify this form, we express it in real coordinates $x^j, y^j$. We have $z^j = x^j + i y^j$ and $\\bar{z}^j = x^j - i y^j$. The differentials are $dz^j = dx^j + i dy^j$ and $d\\bar{z}^j = dx^j - i dy^j$.\nLet's compute the wedge product:\n$$\ndz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j} = (dx^{j} + i dy^{j}) \\wedge (dx^{j} - i dy^{j})\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity and anti-symmetry of the wedge product ($dx^j \\wedge dx^j = 0$, $dy^j \\wedge dy^j = 0$, and $dy^j \\wedge dx^j = -dx^j \\wedge dy^j$):\n$$\ndz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j} = dx^{j} \\wedge (-i dy^{j}) + i dy^{j} \\wedge dx^{j} = -i(dx^{j} \\wedge dy^{j}) - i(dx^{j} \\wedge dy^{j}) = -2i(dx^{j} \\wedge dy^{j})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = i \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-2i \\, dx^{j} \\wedge dy^{j}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-2i^2) \\, dx^{j} \\wedge dy^{j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 2 \\, dx^{j} \\wedge dy^{j}\n$$\nThe standard flat Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is $ds^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n ((dx^j)^2 + (dy^j)^2)$. The most common convention for the associated standard Kähler form (which is also the standard symplectic form) is $\\omega_{\\text{std}} = \\sum_{j=1}^n dx^j \\wedge dy^j$.\nOur derived form $\\omega = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^n dx^j \\wedge dy^j$ is exactly twice this standard form. The definition of the Kähler form can vary by a constant normalization factor; the choice $\\omega = i\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial} K$ is a common one which leads to this result for the flat metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. The identification is thus that $\\omega = 2\\omega_{\\text{std}}$. The computed form is closed ($d\\omega=0$), non-degenerate, and compatible with the standard complex structure, thus it is a valid (and flat) Kähler form.\n\nThe three results to be presented are:\n-   $\\partial K = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\bar{z}^{j} dz^{j}$\n-   $\\bar{\\partial} K = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z^{j} d\\bar{z}^{j}$\n-   $\\omega = i \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\bar{z}^{j} dz^{j} & \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z^{j} d\\bar{z}^{j} & i \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3052797"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the non-compact space $\\mathbb{C}^n$ to a compact manifold allows us to witness the full power of Hodge theory in computing global topological invariants.

The complex structure on $X$ is inherited from the standard complex structure on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. We use complex coordinates $z_1, \\dots, z_n$ on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, where $z_j = x_j + i y_j$ for real coordinates $x_j, y_j$.\n\nThe problem states that $X$ is equipped with the flat Hermitian metric descended from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. This metric is given in complex coordinates by the Hermitian form $h = \\sum_{j=1}^n dz_j \\otimes d\\bar{z}_j$.

This is a fundamental result of Hodge theory.\n\nA differential form on the torus $X$ can be identified with a $\\Lambda$-periodic differential form on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. We first investigate $(p,q)$-forms on $X$ that have constant coefficients. Let such a form be denoted by $\\alpha$. It can be written as a linear combination of basis forms with constant coefficients:\n$$ \\alpha = \\sum_{|I|=p, |J|=q} c_{I,J} \\, dz_I \\wedge d\\bar{z}_J $$\nwhere $c_{I,J} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are constants, $I = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_p\\}$ and $J=\\{j_1, \\dots, j_q\\}$ are ordered multi-indices, and $dz_I = dz_{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dz_{i_p}$, $d\\bar{z}_J = d\\bar{z}_{j_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge d\\bar{z}_{j_q}$.\n\nLet us check if such forms are harmonic.\nFirst, we apply the exterior derivative $d$. Since the coefficients $c_{I,J}$ and the basis forms $dz_I, d\\bar{z}_J$ are constant with respect to the coordinates, their derivatives are zero. Thus, $d\\alpha = 0$. This means any constant-coefficient form on $X$ is closed.\n\nNext, we check the co-closed condition, $d^\\ast\\alpha = 0$. The codifferential is defined as $d^\\ast = - \\ast d \\ast$, where $\\ast$ is the Hodge star operator.\nLet's apply $\\ast$ to $\\alpha$. The Hodge star maps a $(p,q)$-form to an $(n-q, n-p)$-form. For the standard flat metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, the Hodge star of a basis element $dz_I \\wedge d\\bar{z}_J$ is, up to a sign and a constant factor, of the form $dz_{J^c} \\wedge d\\bar{z}_{I^c}$, where $I^c$ and $J^c$ are the complementary index sets. Crucially, $\\ast(dz_I \\wedge d\\bar{z}_J)$ is still a form with constant coefficients. Therefore, $\\ast\\alpha$ is also a form with constant coefficients.\nApplying the exterior derivative to $\\ast\\alpha$ gives $d(\\ast\\alpha)=0$ for the same reason that $d\\alpha=0$.\nNow we can compute $d^\\ast\\alpha$:\n$$ d^\\ast\\alpha = - \\ast d (\\ast\\alpha) = - \\ast(0) = 0 $$\nSo, $\\alpha$ is also co-closed. Since $\\alpha$ is both closed and co-closed, it is harmonic.\nThis establishes that all constant-coefficient $(p,q)$-forms on $X$ are harmonic.\n\nTo show that these are the *only* harmonic forms, we consider the action of the Laplacian more generally. For a flat Kähler manifold, the Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta$ commutes with the operators $dz_I \\wedge$ and $d\\bar{z}_J \\wedge$. If we write a general $(p,q)$-form as $\\beta = \\sum_{I,J} f_{I,J} dz_I \\wedge d\\bar{z}_J$, where the coefficients $f_{I,J}$ are now smooth, $\\Lambda$-periodic functions on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, the Laplacian acts on the coefficients:\n$$ \\Delta \\beta = \\sum_{I,J} (\\Delta_0 f_{I,J}) \\, dz_I \\wedge d\\bar{z}_J $$\nwhere $\\Delta_0$ is the Laplacian on functions, given in these coordinates by $\\Delta_0 f = -4 \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z_k \\partial \\bar{z}_k}$.\nFor $\\beta$ to be harmonic, we must have $\\Delta\\beta = 0$, which implies $\\Delta_0 f_{I,J} = 0$ for all $I,J$. The condition is that each coefficient function must be a harmonic function on the torus $X$.\nSince $X$ is a compact, connected manifold without boundary, the maximum principle for harmonic functions implies that any harmonic function on $X$ must be a constant. Therefore, the coefficients $f_{I,J}$ must be constants.\nThis confirms that the space of harmonic $(p,q)$-forms on $X$, denoted $\\mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)$, is precisely the space of $(p,q)$-forms with constant coefficients.\n\nThe Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a compact orientable Riemannian manifold, the space of all $k$-forms $\\Omega^k(X)$ decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum:\n$$ \\Omega^k(X) = \\mathcal{H}^k(X) \\oplus d\\Omega^{k-1}(X) \\oplus d^\\ast\\Omega^{k+1}(X) $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}^k(X)$ is the space of harmonic $k$-forms. For a Kähler manifold, this decomposition respects the type decomposition of forms. The space of harmonic forms itself decomposes as $\\mathcal{H}^k(X) = \\bigoplus_{p+q=k} \\mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)$.\nFor the complex torus $X$, we have explicitly identified the harmonic spaces $\\mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)$ as the spaces of constant-coefficient forms.\n\nThe basis for the vector space of constant-coefficient $(p,q)$-forms is given by the set of all forms $dz_I \\wedge d\\bar{z}_J$, where $I$ is an ordered multi-index of size $p$ and $J$ is an ordered multi-index of size $q$.\nThe dimension of this space, $h^{p,q}(X) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)$, is the number of such basis elements.\n1.

The cup product is commutative in this context, so $H_1 \\cup H_2 = H_2 \\cup H_1$.\n\nLet's compute the numerator:\n$$\n\\int_M [\\omega] \\cup D = \\int_M (H_1 + H_2) \\cup (2H_1 + 3H_2)\n$$\nExpanding the cup product:\n$$\n(H_1 + H_2) \\cup (2H_1 + 3H_2) = 2(H_1 \\cup H_1) + 3(H_1 \\cup H_2) + 2(H_2 \\cup H_1) + 3(H_2 \\cup H_2)\n$$\n$$\n= 2(H_1 \\cup H_1) + 5(H_1 \\cup H_2) + 3(H_2 \\cup H_2)\n$$\nIntegrating over $M$ and using the given intersection numbers ($\\int_M H_1^2 = 0, \\int_M H_2^2=0, \\int_M H_1H_2=1$):\n$$\n\\int_M [\\omega] \\cup D = 2(0) + 5(1) + 3(0) = 5\n$$\n\nNext, let's compute the denominator:\n$$\n\\int_M [\\omega] \\cup [\\omega] = \\int_M (H_1 + H_2) \\cup (H_1 + H_2)\n$$\nExpanding the cup product:\n$$\n(H_1 + H_2) \\cup (H_1 + H_2) = (H_1 \\cup H_1) + (H_1 \\cup H_2) + (H_2 \\cup H_1) + (H_2 \\cup H_2)\n$$\n$$\n= (H_1 \\cup H_1) + 2(H_1 \\cup H_2) + (H_2 \\cup H_2)\n$$\nIntegrating over $M$:\n$$\n\\int_M [\\omega] \\cup [\\omega] = 0 + 2(1) + 0 = 2\n$$\nNow we can find the constant $c$:\n$$\nc = \\frac{5}{2}\n$$\nWith the value of $c$, we can determine the primitive component $D_p$:\n$$\nD_p = D - c[\\omega] = (2H_1 + 3H_2) - \\frac{5}{2}(H_1 + H_2)\n$$\n$$\nD_p = \\left(2 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)H_1 + \\left(3 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)H_2\n$$\n$$\nD_p = -\\frac{1}{2}H_1 + \\frac{1}{2}H_2\n$$\nFinally, we compute the self-intersection number of $D_p$, which is $\\int_M D_p \\cup D_p$:\n$$\n\\int_M D_p \\cup D_p = \\int_M \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}H_1 + \\frac{1}{2}H_2\\right) \\cup \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}H_1 + \\frac{1}{2}H_2\\right)\n$$\nExpanding the cup product:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}H_1 + \\frac{1}{2}H_2\\right) \\cup \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}H_1 + \\frac{1}{2}H_2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}(H_1 \\cup H_1) - \\frac{1}{4}(H_1 \\cup H_2) - \\frac{1}{4}(H_2 \\cup H_1) + \\frac{1}{4}(H_2 \\cup H_2)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4}(H_1 \\cup H_1) - \\frac{1}{2}(H_1 \\cup H_2) + \\frac{1}{4}(H_2 \\cup H_2)\n$$\nIntegrating over $M$:\n$$\n\\int_M D_p \\cup D_p = \\frac{1}{4}(0) - \\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{1}{4}(0) = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, the self-intersection number of the primitive component of $D$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "930547"}]}
