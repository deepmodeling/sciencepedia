The key to solving this problem lies in establishing the relationship between the energy of a pseudo-holomorphic map and the symplectic area of its image.\n\nLet $u: (S^2, j) \\to (\\mathbb{CP}^n, J_{\\mathrm{FS}})$ be a pseudo-holomorphic map. The target manifold $(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\omega, J_{\\mathrm{FS}})$ is a Kähler manifold, with the Riemannian metric $g$ satisfying the compatibility condition $g(v, w) = \\omega(v, J_{\\mathrm{FS}}w)$ for any tangent vectors $v, w$ in $T\\mathbb{CP}^n$. A map $u$ is pseudo-holomorphic (or $J_{\\mathrm{FS}}$-holomorphic) if its differential $du$ commutes with the complex structures, i.e., $du \\circ j = J_{\\mathrm{FS}} \\circ du$.\n\nThe energy of the map $u$ is defined as\n$$\nE(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{S^{2}} |du|^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dVol}_{j},\n$$\nwhere $|du|^2$ is the squared norm of the differential, computed using the metric $g$ on $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ and the metric on $S^2$ induced by its standard complex structure $j$. Let $\\mathrm{dVol}_{j}$ be the associated volume form on $S^2$.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we first analyze the integrand $|du|^2$ at a point $p \\in S^2$. Let $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ be a local orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p S^2$ with respect to the metric on $S^2$, chosen such that it is oriented and respects the complex structure, i.e., $j(e_1) = e_2$. The volume form evaluated on this basis is $\\mathrm{dVol}_j(e_1, e_2) = 1$.\n\nThe squared norm of the differential at $p$ is given by\n$$\n|du|^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} g(du(e_k), du(e_k)) = g(du(e_1), du(e_1)) + g(du(e_2), du(e_2)).\n$$\nUsing the pseudo-holomorphicity condition $du \\circ j = J_{\\mathrm{FS}} \\circ du$, we have\n$$\ndu(e_2) = du(j(e_1)) = J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1)).\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $|du|^2$:\n$$\n|du|^2 = g(du(e_1), du(e_1)) + g(J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1)), J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1))).\n$$\nSince the metric $g$ is compatible with the almost complex structure $J_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ (in fact, it is Hermitian), it is invariant under $J_{\\mathrm{FS}}$, meaning $g(J_{\\mathrm{FS}}v, J_{\\mathrm{FS}}w) = g(v, w)$ for any vectors $v, w$. Applying this property:\n$$\ng(J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1)), J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1))) = g(du(e_1), du(e_1)).\n$$\nThus, the squared norm simplifies to\n$$\n|du|^2 = 2 g(du(e_1), du(e_1)).\n$$\nNext, we relate this to the pullback of the symplectic form $\\omega$ by the map $u$. The pullback $u^*\\omega$ is a $2$-form on $S^2$. We evaluate it on our local basis $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$:\n$$\n(u^*\\omega)(e_1, e_2) = \\omega(du(e_1), du(e_2)).\n$$\nAgain, using the pseudo-holomorphicity condition $du(e_2) = J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1))$, we get\n$$\n(u^*\\omega)(e_1, e_2) = \\omega(du(e_1), J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1))).\n$$\nNow, we use the fundamental compatibility condition of a Kähler manifold, $g(v, w) = \\omega(v, J_{\\mathrm{FS}} w)$. Setting $v = w = du(e_1)$, this becomes\n$$\ng(du(e_1), du(e_1)) = \\omega(du(e_1), J_{\\mathrm{FS}}(du(e_1))).\n$$\nTherefore, we have established that\n$$\n(u^*\\omega)(e_1, e_2) = g(du(e_1), du(e_1)).\n$$\nSince any $2$-form on a $2$-dimensional manifold is a scalar multiple of the volume form, we can write $u^*\\omega = f \\cdot \\mathrm{dVol}_j$ for some function $f$. Evaluating on our basis, we find the function $f$ is given by $f = (u^*\\omega)(e_1, e_2) = g(du(e_1), du(e_1))$. So, $u^*\\omega = g(du(e_1), du(e_1)) \\mathrm{dVol}_j$.\n\nCombining our two main findings, $|du|^2 = 2 g(du(e_1), du(e_1))$ and $u^*\\omega = g(du(e_1), du(e_1))\\mathrm{dVol}_j$, we arrive at the crucial identity for the energy integrand:\n$$\n|du|^2 \\mathrm{dVol}_j = 2 g(du(e_1), du(e_1)) \\mathrm{dVol}_j = 2 u^*\\omega.\n$$\nNow we can compute the energy $E(u)$ by integrating over $S^2$:\n$$\nE(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{S^2} |du|^2 \\mathrm{dVol}_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{S^2} 2 u^*\\omega = \\int_{S^2} u^*\\omega.\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{S^2} u^*\\omega$ is, by Stokes' theorem (or by definition), the pairing of the cohomology class represented by $\\omega$, denoted $[\\omega] \\in H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^n; \\mathbb{R})$, with the homology class represented by the map $u$, denoted $[u] \\in H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^n; \\mathbb{Z})$.

Each of these is a pseudo-holomorphic map, so the energy-area identity applies to each one. The homology class represented by $u^i$ is given as $d_i[\\ell]$, where $[\\ell]$ is the class of a projective line and $d_i$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe energy of the component $u^i$ is therefore\n$$\nE(u^i) = \\int_{S^2} (u^i)^*\\omega = \\langle [\\omega], [u^i] \\rangle = \\langle [\\omega], d_i[\\ell] \\rangle.\n$$\nBy the linearity of the homological-cohomological pairing, this is\n$$\nE(u^i) = d_i \\langle [\\omega], [\\ell] \\rangle.\n$$\nThe quantity $\\langle [\\omega], [\\ell] \\rangle$ is the integral of the symplectic form $\\omega$ over a representative of the class $[\\ell]$, which is a projective line $\\mathbb{CP}^1$. The problem defines this quantity as $A$:\n$$\nA := \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^1} \\omega = \\langle [\\omega], [\\ell] \\rangle.\n$$\nHence, the energy of a single component $u^i$ is $E(u^i) = d_i A$.\n\nThe question asks for the total energy of all components, which is the sum $\\sum_{i=0}^m E(u^i)$.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{m} E(u^{i}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{m} (d_i A) = A \\sum_{i=0}^{m} d_i.\n$$\nFinally, a central property of Gromov convergence is the conservation of the homology class. The sum of the homology classes of the limit components equals the homology class of the sequence. This is given in the problem as $\\sum_{i=0}^{m} d_i = d$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for the total energy, we obtain the final result:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{m} E(u^{i}) = A d.\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the total energy of a pseudo-holomorphic curve in a Kähler manifold is a topological quantity, determined solely by its homology class and the symplectic form.
