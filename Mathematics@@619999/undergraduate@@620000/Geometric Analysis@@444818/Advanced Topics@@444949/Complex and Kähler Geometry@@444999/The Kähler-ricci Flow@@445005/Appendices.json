First, we must derive the expression for the Kähler form $\\omega$ in complex coordinates. Second, we must directly verify that this form is closed, i.e., $d\\omega = 0$. Third, we must explain the significance of this result in the context of the Kähler-Ricci flow.\n\nWe begin by establishing the relationship between the real coordinates $(x^k, y^k)$ and the complex coordinates $(z^k, \\bar{z}^k)$. The problem states:\n$$z^{k} = x^{k} + \\mathrm{i}\\,y^{k}$$\n$$\\bar{z}^{k} = x^{k} - \\mathrm{i}\\,y^{k}$$\nwhere $k = 1, \\dots, n$. We can invert these relations to express the real coordinates in terms of the complex coordinates:\n$$x^{k} = \\frac{1}{2}(z^k + \\bar{z}^k)$$\n$$y^{k} = \\frac{1}{2\\mathrm{i}}(z^k - \\bar{z}^k) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2}(z^k - \\bar{z}^k)$$\nNext, we find the corresponding relations for the differentials (covector fields):\n$$dz^{k} = dx^{k} + \\mathrm{i}\\,dy^{k}$$\n$$d\\bar{z}^{k} = dx^{k} - \\mathrm{i}\\,dy^{k}$$\nInverting these, we obtain the real coordinate differentials:\n$$dx^{k} = \\frac{1}{2}(dz^k + d\\bar{z}^k)$$\n$$dy^{k} = \\frac{1}{2\\mathrm{i}}(dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k)$$\n\nThe most direct path to find $\\omega$ is to first express it in real coordinates and then substitute the complex differentials. The problem defines the Kähler form as $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX, Y)$ for vector fields $X$ and $Y$. The metric is the standard Euclidean metric $g = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (dx^k \\otimes dx^k + dy^k \\otimes dy^k)$, and the complex structure acts as $J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}$ and $J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$.\nLet's compute the components of $\\omega$ on the real coordinate basis vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j}\\}$.\nFor any indices $k, l \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\delta_{kl}$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = -\\delta_{kl}$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = 0$$\nAs a $2$-form, $\\omega$ is a linear combination of wedge products of basis $1$-forms. Based on the components calculated above, the form is:\n$$\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n dx^k \\wedge dy^k$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $dx^k$ and $dy^k$ in terms of $dz^k$ and $d\\bar{z}^k$:\n\\begin{align*} dx^k \\wedge dy^k = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(dz^k + d\\bar{z}^k) \\right) \\wedge \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\mathrm{i}}(dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k) \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{1}{4\\mathrm{i}} (dz^k + d\\bar{z}^k) \\wedge (dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k) \\\\ = \\frac{1}{4\\mathrm{i}} (dz^k \\wedge dz^k - dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k + d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) \\end{align*}\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, $dz^k \\wedge dz^k = 0$, $d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k = 0$, and $d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge dz^k = -dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$dx^k \\wedge dy^k = \\frac{1}{4\\mathrm{i}} (-dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k - dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) = \\frac{-2}{4\\mathrm{i}} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k = \\frac{-1}{2\\mathrm{i}} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$$\nSince $1/\\mathrm{i} = -\\mathrm{i}$, we have:\n$$dx^k \\wedge dy^k = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$$\nSumming over all $k$ from $1$ to $n$, we obtain the formula for the Kähler form $\\omega$ in complex coordinates:\n$$\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$$\n\nFor the second task, we must verify that $d\\omega = 0$ directly. We apply the exterior derivative $d$ to the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$d\\omega = d\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k\\right)$$\nSince $d$ is a linear operator and commutes with constant coefficients, we can write:\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n d(dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k)$$\nWe use the graded Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative on a wedge product of forms: $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (d\\alpha) \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^p \\alpha \\wedge (d\\beta)$ where $\\alpha$ is a $p$-form. Here, $dz^k$ and $d\\bar{z}^k$ are $1$-forms, so $p=1$.\n$$d(dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) = d(dz^k) \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k - dz^k \\wedge d(d\\bar{z}^k)$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that it is nilpotent, i.e., $d^2 = d \\circ d = 0$. This means that for any smooth function (a $0$-form) $f$, we have $d(df) = 0$. The complex coordinates $z^k$ and $\\bar{z}^k$ are smooth functions on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Therefore, $dz^k$ is an exact $1$-form, and $d(dz^k)=0$. Similarly, $d(d\\bar{z}^k)=0$.\nSubstituting these into our expression:\n$$d(dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) = 0 \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k - dz^k \\wedge 0 = 0$$\nThus, each term in the sum for $d\\omega$ is zero, which implies:\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n 0 = 0$$\nThis completes the direct verification that $\\omega$ is a closed form.\n\nFor the third task, we relate this to the Kähler-Ricci flow (KRF). The KRF is an evolution equation for a family of Kähler metrics $g(t)$ on a complex manifold $M$, given by:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_{i\\bar{j}}(t)}{\\partial t} = -R_{i\\bar{j}}(t)$$\nwhere $g_{i\\bar{j}}$ are the components of the metric tensor in complex coordinates and $R_{i\\bar{j}}$ are the components of its Ricci tensor. An essential requirement for this flow is the existence of an initial Kähler metric $g(0)$. A Hermitian metric $g$ is Kähler if and only if its associated fundamental $2$-form $\\omega$ is closed ($d\\omega=0$). Our verification $d\\omega = 0$ for the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ confirms that it is indeed a Kähler metric, making it a valid initial datum for the KRF.\n\nThe flat Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is characterized by the fact that its curvature tensor, and therefore its Ricci tensor, is identically zero. Thus, for our initial metric $g(0)$, we have $R_{i\\bar{j}}(0) = 0$. When we substitute this into the KRF equation, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_{i\\bar{j}}}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{t=0} = -R_{i\\bar{j}}(0) = 0$$\nThis means the metric does not change at $t=0$. The unique solution to the flow with this initial condition is a static one: $g(t) = g(0)$ for all time $t \\ge 0$. In other words, the flat metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is a fixed point of the Kähler-Ricci flow. It represents the most fundamental example of a Ricci-flat Kähler metric and serves as a canonical, albeit trivial, stationary solution to the flow equation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k}$$", "id": "3070735"}, {"introduction": "Having established what a fixed point of the flow looks like, we now turn our attention to the structure of the flow equation itself.

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the scalar evolution equation for the function $u(t,x)$ from the unnormalized Kähler–Ricci flow. The evolving metric is given by $\\omega(t) = \\exp(2u(t,x))\\omega_{*}$. Differentiating with respect to time $t$ gives $\\partial_{t}\\omega = \\partial_{t}(\\exp(2u))\\omega_{*} = 2(\\partial_{t}u)\\exp(2u)\\omega_{*}$. The Kähler–Ricci flow is given by $\\partial_{t}\\omega = -\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)$. For a complex curve, the Ricci form is $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega) = K_{\\omega}\\omega$, where $K_{\\omega}$ is the Gauss curvature. Thus, $\\partial_{t}\\omega = -K_{\\omega}\\omega = -K_{\\omega}\\exp(2u)\\omega_{*}$. Equating the two expressions for $\\partial_{t}\\omega$ yields $2(\\partial_{t}u)\\exp(2u)\\omega_{*} = -K_{\\omega}\\exp(2u)\\omega_{*}$, which simplifies to $2\\partial_{t}u = -K_{\\omega}$. We are given the formula for the change in curvature under a conformal transformation: $K_{\\omega} = K_{\\exp(2u)\\omega_{*}} = \\exp(-2u)(K_{*} - \\Delta_{*}u)$. Substituting this into our equation for $\\partial_{t}u$ gives $2\\partial_{t}u = -\\exp(-2u)(K_{*} - \\Delta_{*}u)$. With the given normalization $K_{*}=1$, the scalar evolution equation for $u(t,x)$ is\n$$\n\\partial_{t}u = -\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2u)(1-\\Delta_{*}u).\n$$\nNext, we derive and solve the ordinary differential equation for the total area $A(t) = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}}\\omega(t)$. Differentiating $A(t)$ with respect to time, we have\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}}\\exp(2u)\\omega_{*} = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}} \\partial_{t}(\\exp(2u))\\omega_{*} = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}} 2(\\partial_{t}u)\\exp(2u)\\omega_{*}.\n$$\nFrom the previous derivation, we have $2\\partial_{t}u = -K_{\\omega}$, which implies $2(\\partial_{t}u)\\exp(2u) = -K_{\\omega}\\exp(2u)$. Substituting the conformal curvature formula gives $K_{\\omega}\\exp(2u) = \\exp(-2u)(K_{*}-\\Delta_{*}u)\\exp(2u) = K_{*}-\\Delta_{*}u$. Therefore, $2(\\partial_{t}u)\\exp(2u) = -(K_{*}-\\Delta_{*}u)$. The rate of change of area is then\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}} -(K_{*}-\\Delta_{*}u)\\omega_{*} = -\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}}K_{*}\\omega_{*} + \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}}\\Delta_{*}u\\,\\omega_{*}.\n$$\nUsing the provided identities $\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}}K_{*}\\omega_{*} = 4\\pi$ and $\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{1}}\\Delta_{*}u\\,\\omega_{*} = 0$, we find $\\frac{dA}{dt} = -4\\pi$. This is a simple first-order ODE. Integrating with respect to $t$ gives $A(t) = -4\\pi t + C$. The initial condition $A(0) = A_{0}$ implies that the integration constant is $C=A_{0}$. Thus, the area evolves as $A(t) = A_{0} - 4\\pi t$. The extinction time $T$ is the time at which the area becomes zero, $A(T)=0$. Solving $A_{0}-4\\pi T=0$ gives $T=\\frac{A_{0}}{4\\pi}$.\n\nNow, we analyze the normalized flow. The normalized metric is $\\widehat{\\omega}(\\tau) = \\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}\\omega(t)$ and the normalized time is defined by $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}$, with $\\tau(0)=0$. We want to show that $\\partial_{\\tau}\\widehat{\\omega} = -\\mathrm{Ric}(\\widehat{\\omega}) + \\widehat{\\omega}$. Using the chain rule, $\\partial_{\\tau} = \\frac{dt}{d\\tau}\\partial_{t} = \\frac{A(t)}{4\\pi}\\partial_{t}$.\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau}\\widehat{\\omega} = \\frac{A(t)}{4\\pi}\\partial_{t}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}\\omega(t)\\right) = \\frac{A(t)}{4\\pi}\\left[ \\left(\\partial_{t}\\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}\\right)\\omega(t) + \\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}\\partial_{t}\\omega(t) \\right].\n$$\nThe derivative of the scaling factor is $\\partial_{t}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}\\right) = 4\\pi\\left(-\\frac{1}{A(t)^{2}}\\right)\\frac{dA}{dt} = -\\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)^{2}}(-4\\pi) = \\frac{16\\pi^{2}}{A(t)^{2}}$. We also have $\\partial_{t}\\omega = -\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\partial_{\\tau}\\widehat{\\omega}$ yields\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau}\\widehat{\\omega} = \\frac{A(t)}{4\\pi}\\left[ \\frac{16\\pi^{2}}{A(t)^{2}}\\omega(t) - \\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) \\right] = \\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}\\omega(t) - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)).\n$$\nThe first term is $\\widehat{\\omega}(\\tau)$. Since $\\widehat{\\omega}$ is conformal to $\\omega$ via a factor that depends only on time, their Ricci forms are identical, i.e., $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\widehat{\\omega}) = \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)$. This is because the correction term in the transformation law for the Ricci form involves spatial derivatives of the logarithm of the conformal factor, which are zero here. Hence, we have shown $\\partial_{\\tau}\\widehat{\\omega} = \\widehat{\\omega}(\\tau) - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\widehat{\\omega})$.\nThe problem correctly states that the scalar equation for $\\widehat{u}$ in $\\widehat{\\omega}=\\exp(2\\widehat{u})\\omega_{*}$ is a uniformly parabolic reaction-diffusion equation with steady state $\\widehat{u}\\equiv 0$. The evolution equation for the curvature $K$ of $\\widehat{\\omega}$ is given as $\\partial_{\\tau}K = \\Delta K + K(K-1)$, where $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian of the evolving metric $\\widehat{\\omega}$. The average curvature is $\\bar{K} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int K\\widehat{\\omega} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int \\mathrm{Ric}(\\widehat{\\omega}) = \\frac{2\\pi\\chi(\\mathbb{CP}^{1})}{4\\pi}=1$. The equation is Hamilton's equation for the normalized flow. By the maximum principle, if $K_{max}(\\tau)=\\max_{x}K(\\tau,x)$, then at the point of maximum $\\Delta K \\le 0$, so $\\frac{d}{d\\tau}K_{max} \\le K_{max}(K_{max}-1)$. Similarly, for $K_{min}(\\tau)=\\min_{x}K(\\tau,x)$, we have $\\frac{d}{d\\tau}K_{min} \\ge K_{min}(K_{min}-1)$. Solutions to the ODE $y' = y(y-1)$ with positive initial data converge to the stable fixed point $y=1$. By the comparison principle for PDEs, $K(\\tau,x)$ is squeezed between two functions that both converge to $1$. Thus, $K(\\tau,x) \\to 1$ uniformly as $\\tau\\to\\infty$. This implies that the normalized metric $\\widehat{\\omega}(\\tau)$ converges smoothly to the standard Fubini-Study metric $\\omega_{*}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the explicit expression for $\\tau(t)$. We have the definition $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{4\\pi}{A(t)}$. Substituting the expression for $A(t)$, we get $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{4\\pi}{A_{0}-4\\pi t}$. To find $\\tau(t)$, we integrate this from $s=0$ to $s=t$, using the initial condition $\\tau(0)=0$:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{4\\pi}{A_{0}-4\\pi s} ds.\n$$\nThe integral is evaluated as\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\left[-\\ln(A_{0}-4\\pi s)\\right]_{0}^{t},\n$$\nwhere we can drop the absolute value since $A(t) = A_{0} - 4\\pi t  0$ for $tT$. Evaluating the limits, we get\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\left(-\\ln(A_{0}-4\\pi t)\\right) - \\left(-\\ln(A_{0})\\right) = \\ln(A_{0}) - \\ln(A_{0}-4\\pi t).\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{A_{0}-4\\pi t}\\right).\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $\\tau$ as a function of $t$ and $A_{0}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{A_{0} - 4\\pi t}\\right)}$$", "id": "3070695"}]}
