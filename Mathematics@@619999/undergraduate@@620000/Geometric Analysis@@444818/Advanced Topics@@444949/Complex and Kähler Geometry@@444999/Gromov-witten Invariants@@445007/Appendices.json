The space of infinitesimal deformations is identified with the space of global sections of the pullback of the tangent bundle, $H^0(\\mathbb{C}P^1, f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n)$. The obstruction space is $H^1(\\mathbb{C}P^1, f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n)$. The expected complex dimension of the space of deformations is the index of the associated linearized Cauchy-Riemann operator, which is given by the Euler characteristic $\\chi(f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n) = h^0(f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n) - h^1(f^*T\\mathbb{C}P^n)$.\n2. The parameters for the positions of the $k$ marked points on the domain $\\mathbb{C}P^1$.

We will solve this by following the three steps outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected complex dimension of the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{0,2}(X, H)$ and verify the well-posedness of the integral definition of the invariant. The general formula for the expected complex dimension of the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\overline{M}_{g,n}(X, \\beta) = (1-g)(\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X - 3) + n + \\int_{\\beta} c_1(TX)\n$$\nIn our specific case, the genus is $g=0$, the number of marked points is $n=2$, the target space is $X = \\mathbb{C}P^2$, and the curve homology class is $\\beta = H$, the hyperplane class.\n\nThe complex dimension of the target space is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathbb{C}P^2 = 2$.\nTo find the integral term $\\int_{H} c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2)$, we first need the first Chern class $c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2)$ of the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{C}P^2$. The tangent bundle $T\\mathbb{C}P^2$ fits into the Euler exact sequence:\n$$\n0 \\to \\mathcal{O} \\to \\mathcal{O}(H)^{\\oplus 3} \\to T\\mathbb{C}P^2 \\to 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{O}$ is the trivial line bundle and $\\mathcal{O}(H)$ is the hyperplane line bundle whose first Chern class is $c_1(\\mathcal{O}(H)) = H$. Using the multiplicativity of the total Chern class $c$, we have $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = c(\\mathcal{O}(H)^{\\oplus 3}) / c(\\mathcal{O}) = (c(\\mathcal{O}(H)))^3$.\nSince $c(\\mathcal{O}(H)) = 1 + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(H)) = 1+H$, the total Chern class of $T\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is:\n$$\nc(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = (1+H)^3 = 1 + 3H + 3H^2 + H^3\n$$\nIn the cohomology ring $H^*(\\mathbb{C}P^2; \\mathbb{Z})$, the class $H^k = 0$ for $k > 2$ since $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathbb{C}P^2 = 2$. Thus, $H^3=0$ and $c(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = 1 + 3H + 3H^2$.\nThe first Chern class is the term of degree $2$, so $c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = 3H$.\nNow we can compute the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{H} c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = \\int_{H} 3H = 3 \\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H \\smile H = 3 \\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H^2\n$$\nThe intersection number $\\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H^2$ is the self-intersection of a generic line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$, which corresponds to the degree of the projective line, equal to $1$. More formally, in the Chow ring, $H^2$ is the class of a point, so the integral evaluates to $1$. Thus, $\\int_{H} c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\nSubstituting all values into the dimension formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vdim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H) = (1-0)(2 - 3) + 2 + 3 = -1 + 2 + 3 = 4\n$$\nThe expected complex dimension of the moduli space is $4$. The virtual fundamental class $[\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H)]^{\\mathrm{vir}}$ is therefore a homology class of real dimension $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nThe invariant is defined by the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{[\\overline{M}_{0,2}(X,H)]^{\\mathrm{vir}}} \\mathrm{ev}_1^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})) \\smile \\mathrm{ev}_2^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))\n$$\nThe Poincaré dual of a point class in $X=\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is a cohomology class $\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\in H^{2 \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X}(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = H^4(\\mathbb{C}P^2; \\mathbb{Z})$. The degree of this class is $4$.\nThe evaluation maps $\\mathrm{ev}_1, \\mathrm{ev}_2$ pull this class back to the moduli space. The pullback classes $\\mathrm{ev}_1^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ are elements of $H^4(\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe cup product of these two classes is the integrand:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_1^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})) \\smile \\mathrm{ev}_2^{*}(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})) \\in H^{4+4}(\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H); \\mathbb{Z}) = H^8(\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H); \\mathbb{Z})\n$$\nThe integral pairs an $8$-dimensional homology class (the virtual fundamental class) with an $8$-th degree cohomology class (the integrand). The degrees match, so the result of the integration is a number, as expected.\n\nSecond, we argue that the invariant counts the number of degree-$1$ curves passing through two generic points. The Gromov-Witten invariant is constructed to provide a rigorous count of such curves. The constraints $\\mathrm{ev}_1^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2^*(\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt}))$ impose the geometric conditions that the images of the two marked points, $\\mathrm{ev}_1(f)$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2(f)$, must lie on the submanifolds Poincaré dual to $\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{pt})$. For a point class, this submanifold is simply a point. If we choose two generic points $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}P^2$, the constraints become $\\mathrm{ev}_1(f) = p_1$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2(f) = p_2$. In this case, for generic points, transversality holds, and the virtual fundamental class can be identified with the ordinary fundamental class of the moduli space (which is a smooth manifold of the expected dimension in this simple case). The integral then counts the number of points in the moduli space satisfying these conditions. A point in $\\overline{M}_{0,2}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, H)$ is a stable map $f: C \\to \\mathbb{C}P^2$ where $C$ is a genus-$0$ curve, the degree of the image is $1$ (a line), and there are two marked points on $C$. The conditions $\\mathrm{ev}_1(f) = p_1$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_2(f) = p_2$ mean that the image of the curve $f(C)$ must contain both points $p_1$ and $p_2$. Therefore, the invariant $\\langle \\mathrm{pt}, \\mathrm{pt} \\rangle_{0,H}$ counts the number of complex projective lines in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ that pass through two given generic points $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nThird, we determine this number using classical projective geometry. A point in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is represented by a 1-dimensional subspace in $\\mathbb{C}^3$. Two distinct generic points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ correspond to two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb{C}^3$, spanned by linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. A complex projective line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is the projectivization of a 2-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{C}^3$. A line passes through $p_1$ and $p_2$ if and only if the corresponding 2-dimensional subspace in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ contains the 1-dimensional subspaces spanned by $v_1$ and $v_2$. Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, they span a unique 2-dimensional subspace, namely $\\mathrm{span}(v_1, v_2)$. The projectivization of this unique 2-dimensional subspace gives the unique complex projective line passing through $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nAlternatively, a line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is defined by a linear equation $a_0 x_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 = 0$, where $[a_0: a_1: a_2]$ are the homogeneous coordinates of the line in the dual projective plane $(\\mathbb{C}P^2)^*$. Let $p_1 = [v_0: v_1: v_2]$ and $p_2 = [w_0: w_1: w_2]$. For a line to pass through both points, its coefficients must satisfy:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na_0 v_0 + a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 = 0 \\\\\na_0 w_0 + a_1 w_1 + a_2 w_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is a system of two linear equations for the three unknowns $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct, the vectors $v = (v_0, v_1, v_2)$ and $w = (w_0, w_1, w_2)$ are linearly independent. The coefficient matrix of this system has rank $2$. The solution space for the vector $a=(a_0, a_1, a_2)$ is therefore 1-dimensional. A 1-dimensional vector space of coefficients corresponds to a single point in the dual projective plane $(\\mathbb{C}P^2)^*$, and thus to a single unique line in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$.\n\nBoth geometric arguments lead to the conclusion that there is exactly $1$ line passing through two generic points in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$.\nTherefore, the value of the Gromov-Witten invariant is $1$.\n\n$$\n\\langle \\mathrm{pt}, \\mathrm{pt} \\rangle_{0,H} = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3050949"}, {"introduction": "Calculating invariants directly from their integral definition can be complex.
