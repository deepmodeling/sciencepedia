We proceed with the solution by following the specified steps.\n\nThe manifold is $M = \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with global coordinates $(x,y,u,v)$. The almost complex structure $J$ is defined on the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u}, \\partial_{v}\\}$ as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*} J(\\partial_{x}) &= \\partial_{y} \\\\ J(\\partial_{y}) &= -\\partial_{x} \\\\ J(\\partial_{u}) &= \\partial_{v} + x\\,\\partial_{x} \\\\ J(\\partial_{v}) &= -\\partial_{u} - x\\,\\partial_{y} \\end{align*}\n$$\nWe are given the specific real vector fields $X = \\partial_{x}$ and $Y = \\partial_{u}$. The projection operators onto the $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ subbundles of the complexified tangent bundle $T_{\\mathbb{C}}M$ are defined for any real vector field $V$ as:\n$$\nP^{1,0}(V) = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigl(V - i\\,JV\\bigr), \\qquad P^{0,1}(V) = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigl(V + i\\,JV\\bigr)\n$$\nThese definitions are extended to complex vector fields by $\\mathbb{C}$-linearity.\n\n**1) Compute the projections $P^{1,0}(X)$, $P^{0,1}(X)$, $P^{1,0}(Y)$, and $P^{0,1}(Y)$**\n\nFor $X = \\partial_{x}$, we have $JX = J(\\partial_{x}) = \\partial_{y}$.\n$$\nP^{1,0}(X) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} - iJ(\\partial_{x})) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{y})\n$$\n$$\nP^{0,1}(X) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} + iJ(\\partial_{x})) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y})\n$$\nFor $Y = \\partial_{u}$, we have $JY = J(\\partial_{u}) = \\partial_{v} + x\\partial_{x}$.\n$$\nP^{1,0}(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} - iJ(\\partial_{u})) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} - i(\\partial_{v} + x\\partial_{x})) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} - ix\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{v})\n$$\n$$\nP^{0,1}(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} + iJ(\\partial_{u})) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} + i(\\partial_{v} + x\\partial_{x})) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} + ix\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{v})\n$$\n\n**2) Compute the Lie bracket $\\bigl[P^{1,0}(X), P^{1,0}(Y)\\bigr]$ and its $(0,1)$ projection**\n\nLet $Z_{1} = P^{1,0}(X) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{y})$ and $Z_{2} = P^{1,0}(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} - ix\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{v})$.\nWe compute the Lie bracket $[Z_{1}, Z_{2}]$:\n$$\n[Z_{1}, Z_{2}] = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{y}), \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{u} - ix\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{v})\\right] = \\frac{1}{4} [\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u} - ix\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{v}]\n$$\nWe use the bilinearity of the Lie bracket and the formula $[fU, gV] = f(Ug)V - g(Vf)U + fg[U,V]$, where $f, g$ are functions and $U,V$ are vector fields. Since all coordinate vector fields commute, $[U,V]=0$ for $U,V \\in \\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u}, \\partial_{v}\\}$. The formula simplifies to $[fU, gV] = f(U(g))V - g(V(f))U$.\n\nThe bracket expands to:\n$$\n[\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u} - ix\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{v}] = [\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{u}] + [\\partial_{x}, -ix\\partial_{x}] + [\\partial_{x}, -i\\partial_{v}] - i[\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u}] - i[\\partial_{y}, -ix\\partial_{x}] - i[\\partial_{y}, -i\\partial_{v}]\n$$\nLet's evaluate each term:\n- $[\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{u}] = 0$, $[\\partial_{x}, -i\\partial_{v}]=0$, $[\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u}]=0$, $[\\partial_{y}, -i\\partial_{v}]=0$ as coefficients are constant and fields commute.\n- $[\\partial_{x}, -ix\\partial_{x}] = \\partial_{x}(-ix)\\partial_{x} - (-ix)\\partial_{x}(1)\\partial_{x} = (-i)\\partial_{x} - 0 = -i\\partial_{x}$.\n- $[\\partial_{y}, -ix\\partial_{x}] = \\partial_{y}(-ix)\\partial_{x} - (-ix)\\partial_{x}(-i)\\partial_{y} = (0)\\partial_{x} - 0 = 0$.\n\nSumming the terms, the bracket becomes:\n$$\n[\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u} - ix\\partial_{x} - i\\partial_{v}] = -i\\partial_{x}\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n[Z_{1}, Z_{2}] = \\frac{1}{4}(-i\\partial_{x}) = -\\frac{i}{4}\\partial_{x}\n$$\nNow we compute its $(0,1)$ projection:\n$$\nP^{0,1}\\bigl(\\,[P^{1,0}(X), P^{1,0}(Y)]\\,\\bigr) = P^{0,1}\\left(-\\frac{i}{4}\\partial_{x}\\right) = -\\frac{i}{4}P^{0,1}(\\partial_{x})\n$$\nUsing the result from Part 1, $P^{0,1}(\\partial_{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y})$.\n$$\nP^{0,1}\\bigl(\\,[P^{1,0}(X), P^{1,0}(Y)]\\,\\bigr) = -\\frac{i}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y}) \\right) = -\\frac{i}{8}(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y}) = \\frac{1}{8}\\partial_{y} - \\frac{i}{8}\\partial_{x}\n$$\n\n**3) Determine the complex scalar $c$**\n\nWe are asked to find the complex scalar $c$ such that $P^{0,1}\\bigl(\\,[P^{1,0}(X), P^{1,0}(Y)]\\,\\bigr) = c P^{0,1}(X)$.\nSubstituting the expressions we found:\n$$\n-\\frac{i}{8}(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y}) = c \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y}) \\right)\n$$\nSince $(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y})$ is a non-zero vector field, we can equate the scalar coefficients:\n$$\n-\\frac{i}{8} = \\frac{c}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $c$:\n$$\nc = 2 \\left(-\\frac{i}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{i}{4}\n$$\n\n**4) Evaluate $N_{J}(X,Y)$ and explain its significance**\n\nThe Nijenhuis tensor is defined as $N_{J}(U,V) = [JU,JV] - J[JU,V] - J[U,JV] - [U,V]$. We evaluate it for $U=X=\\partial_{x}$ and $V=Y=\\partial_{u}$.\nWe have:\n- $X = \\partial_{x}$, $Y = \\partial_{u}$\n- $JX = \\partial_{y}$, $JY = \\partial_{v} + x\\partial_{x}$\n- $[X,Y] = [\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{u}] = 0$\n- $[JX,Y] = [\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{u}] = 0$\n- $[X,JY] = [\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{v} + x\\partial_{x}] = [\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{v}] + [\\partial_{x}, x\\partial_{x}] = 0 + \\partial_{x}(x)\\partial_{x} - x\\partial_{x}(1)\\partial_{x} = \\partial_{x}$\n- $[JX,JY] = [\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{v} + x\\partial_{x}] = [\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{v}] + [\\partial_{y}, x\\partial_{x}] = 0 + \\partial_{y}(x)\\partial_{x} - x\\partial_{x}(1)\\partial_{y} = 0$\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $N_J(X,Y)$:\n$$\nN_{J}(X,Y) = 0 - J(0) - J(\\partial_{x}) - 0 = -J(\\partial_{x}) = -\\partial_{y}\n$$\nThe almost complex structure $J$ is integrable (i.e., it arises from a local biholomorphism to $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$) if and only if its Nijenhuis tensor vanishes identically, $N_{J} \\equiv 0$. This is the content of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem. An equivalent condition for integrability is that the subbundle of $(1,0)$-vectors, $T^{1,0}M$, is involutive, meaning it is closed under the Lie bracket. That is, for any two $(1,0)$-vector fields $Z_1, Z_2$, their Lie bracket $[Z_1, Z_2]$ must also be a $(1,0)$-vector field. This is equivalent to saying that the $(0,1)$-projection of the bracket is zero: $P^{0,1}([Z_1, Z_2]) = 0$.\n\nIn our case, we found $N_{J}(X,Y) = -\\partial_{y} \\neq 0$, which proves that $J$ is not integrable. This lack of integrability is demonstrated by the fact that the Lie bracket of the $(1,0)$-fields $P^{1,0}(X)$ and $P^{1,0}(Y)$ has a non-zero $(0,1)$-component, as computed in Part 2:\n$$\nP^{0,1}\\bigl(\\,[P^{1,0}(X), P^{1,0}(Y)]\\,\\bigr) = -\\frac{i}{8}(\\partial_{x} + i\\partial_{y}) \\neq 0\n$$\nThus, the non-vanishing of $N_J(X,Y)$ directly corresponds to the failure of the $(1,0)$-subbundle to be closed under the Lie bracket.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the scalar $c$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{i}{4}}\n$$", "id": "3043220"}]}
