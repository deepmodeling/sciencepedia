Consider the heat equation (a partial differential equation (PDE)) $\\partial_{t} u = \\Delta u$ with initial data $u(x,0) = f(x)$, where $f$ is an integrable function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The heat kernel $H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t)$ is the fundamental solution that satisfies $u(x,t) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t) f(y) \\, dy$ and the semigroup property $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t) H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(y,z,s) \\, dy = H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,z,t+s)$ for all $t,s0$, $x,z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

It is self-contained, consistent, and requires the derivation of the fundamental solution to the heat equation in Euclidean space, verification of its semigroup property, and determination of a sharp constant in a Gaussian upper-bound estimate. The problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts:\n1.  Derive the explicit expression for the heat kernel $H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n2.  Explicitly compute the integral representing the semigroup property.\n3.  Determine the smallest constant $C$ in the specified Li-Yau type upper bound.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Heat Kernel**\n\nWe begin with the heat equation on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u(x,t) = \\Delta u(x,t)\n$$\nwith initial condition $u(x,0) = f(x)$.\n\nThe problem states that Fourier analysis diagonalizes the Laplacian $\\Delta$. We define the Fourier transform of a function $g(x)$ and its inverse transform as:\n$$\n\\hat{g}(\\xi) = \\mathcal{F}[g](\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} g(x) \\exp(-2\\pi i x \\cdot \\xi) \\, dx\n$$\n$$\ng(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{g}](x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\hat{g}(\\xi) \\exp(2\\pi i x \\cdot \\xi) \\, d\\xi\n$$\nUnder this convention, the Fourier transform of the Laplacian is given by $\\mathcal{F}[\\Delta g](\\xi) = -(2\\pi|\\xi|)^{2} \\hat{g}(\\xi) = -4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} \\hat{g}(\\xi)$.\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the heat equation with respect to the spatial variable $x$, we convert the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation in the time variable $t$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\hat{u}(\\xi,t) = -4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} \\hat{u}(\\xi,t)\n$$\nFor a fixed frequency vector $\\xi$, this is a first-order linear ODE in $t$. The solution is:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(\\xi,t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi,0) \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} t)\n$$\nThe initial condition $u(x,0) = f(x)$ transforms to $\\hat{u}(\\xi,0) = \\hat{f}(\\xi)$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\hat{u}(\\xi,t) = \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} t)\n$$\nThe solution $u(x,t)$ is obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform. The product in Fourier space corresponds to a convolution in real space:\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{f}(\\xi) \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} t)](x) = (f * K_{t})(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} K_{t}(x-y) f(y) \\, dy\n$$\nwhere $K_{t}(x)$ is the function whose Fourier transform is $\\hat{K}_{t}(\\xi) = \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} t)$. The heat kernel is precisely this convolution kernel, $H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t) = K_{t}(x-y)$, reflecting the translation invariance of the operator on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nWe must now compute the inverse Fourier transform of $\\hat{K}_{t}(\\xi)$.

We set:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{a} = 4\\pi^{2}t \\implies a = \\frac{1}{4t}\n$$\nSubstituting this value of $a$ back into the Fourier transform identity, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t}\\right)\\right](\\xi) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{1/(4t)}\\right)^{n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2}}{1/(4t)}\\right) = (4\\pi t)^{n/2} \\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} t)\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} t) = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2} \\mathcal{F}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t}\\right)\\right](\\xi)\n$$\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform of both sides yields:\n$$\nK_{t}(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\exp(-4\\pi^{2}|\\xi|^{2} t)](x) = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t}\\right)\n$$\nSince $H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t) = K_{t}(x-y)$, the explicit expression for the heat kernel is:\n$$\nH_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t) = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x-y|^{2}}{4t}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Verification of the Semigroup Property**\n\nWe are asked to compute the integral $I = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y,t) H_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(y,z,s) \\, dy$.

This means $A$ must be greater than or equal to the supremum of the right-hand side over all possible values of $|x-y|^{2}$ and $t$. Let $d = |x-y| \\geq 0$. The expression to analyze is $\\frac{d^{2}}{t}\\left(\\frac{1}{C} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$.\n\nCase 1: $ \\frac{1}{C} - \\frac{1}{4}  0 $, which is equivalent to $C  4$.\nIn this case, the term $\\left(\\frac{1}{C} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$ is positive. The quantity $\\frac{d^{2}}{t}$ is unbounded above (for instance, let $t \\to 0^{+}$ for a fixed $d0$). Consequently, the argument of the exponential is unbounded above, and the right-hand side of the inequality has a supremum of $+\\infty$. No finite constant $A$ can satisfy the inequality for all $x,y,t$. Thus, we must have $C \\geq 4$.\n\nCase 2: $ \\frac{1}{C} - \\frac{1}{4} \\leq 0 $, which is equivalent to $C \\geq 4$.\nIn this case, the term $\\left(\\frac{1}{C} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$ is non-positive. Since $\\frac{d^{2}}{t} \\geq 0$, the argument of the exponential, $\\frac{d^{2}}{t}\\left(\\frac{1}{C} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$, is always less than or equal to $0$. The exponential function is therefore maximized when its argument is $0$, which occurs when $d=0$. The maximum value of the exponential term is $\\exp(0) = 1$.\nThe supremum of the right-hand side is therefore $(4\\pi)^{-n/2}$.\nThus, for any $C \\geq 4$, there exists a constant $A(n)$ satisfying the inequality for all $x,y,t$. Specifically, any constant $A(n) \\geq (4\\pi)^{-n/2}$ will suffice.\n\nThe set of all possible values of $C$ for which a suitable $A(n)$ exists is $[4, \\infty)$. The problem asks for the smallest such constant $C$. The minimum value in this set is $4$.\nFor this smallest value $C=4$, the inequality holds if we choose any $A(n) \\geq (4\\pi)^{-n/2}$. The constant $A(n)$ obtained in the derivation, by taking the sharpest possible choice, is $A(n) = (4\\pi)^{-n/2}$.\n\nThe final answer is the smallest value of $C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3055156"}, {"introduction": "The Li-Yau gradient estimate provides a powerful inequality, $|\\nabla \\log u|^2 - \\partial_t \\log u \\le \\frac{n}{2t}$, for positive solutions of the heat equation.

For a time-dependent factor $c(t)$ multiplying a Gaussian heat kernel, $u(x,t)=c(t)\\,(4\\pi t)^{-n/2}\\exp(-|x-x_0|^2/(4t))$ fails to solve $u_t=\\Delta u$ unless $c'(t)=0$, because the additional term $c'(t)$ cannot be canceled by spatial derivatives. Hence the stated family is not, in general, a family of solutions, and equality does not hold as claimed. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: A finite positive linear combination of heat kernels is a solution by linearity of the heat equation, but the Li–Yau expression is nonlinear in $u$ (it involves $\\log u$), so equality for each summand does not imply equality for the sum. In fact, for $u=\\sum_{j} c_j K(\\cdot,t;x_j)$ with at least two distinct centers, direct calculation shows\n$$\n\\nabla \\log u = \\frac{\\sum_j c_j \\nabla K_j}{\\sum_j c_j K_j},\\quad \\partial_t \\log u = \\frac{\\sum_j c_j \\partial_t K_j}{\\sum_j c_j K_j},\n$$\nand cancellations that yield equality for a single Gaussian no longer occur; the result is strictly less than $\\frac{n}{2t}$ for $t0$ except in the trivial one-center case. The claimed characterization is therefore false. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: Step 1 provides explicit solutions with equality at all positive times, so the claim that equality can never occur is false. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3055287"}]}
