Provide your answer as a single exact value with no units.", "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. We address each in turn.\n\n**Part 1: Reduction of the flow equation for a time-independent map**\n\nThe harmonic map heat flow is described by the partial differential equation\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u = \\tau(u)\n$$\nwhere $u \\colon M \\times [0,T] \\to N$ is a smooth map, and $\\tau(u)$ is its tension field. The term $\\partial_{t} u$ represents the velocity vector field of the family of maps $u(\\cdot, t)$. For a fixed point $x \\in M$, the curve $c_x(t) = u(x,t)$ in $N$ has the velocity vector $\\frac{d c_x}{dt} = \\partial_t u(x,t)$.\n\nWe are given the special case where the map is independent of time, i.e., $u(x,t) = u_0(x)$ for some smooth map $u_0 \\colon M \\to N$.\n\nIn this case, for any fixed $x \\in M$, the curve $c_x(t) = u(x,t) = u_0(x)$ is a constant point in the manifold $N$. The velocity vector of a constant curve is the zero vector. Therefore, the left-hand side of the heat flow equation is identically zero:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u(x,t) = \\partial_{t} u_0(x) = 0\n$$\nfor all $(x,t) \\in M \\times [0,T]$.\n\nSubstituting this result into the harmonic map heat flow equation, we find that the right-hand side must also be zero:\n$$\n\\tau(u) = 0\n$$\nSince $u = u_0$, this reduces to:\n$$\n\\tau(u_0) = 0\n$$\nThis is the equation for a harmonic map. Thus, a time-independent solution to the harmonic map heat flow must be a harmonic map. The conditions of metric compatibility and the divergence theorem, while essential for the underlying theory (especially for Part 2), are not directly required for this initial deduction.\n\n**Part 2: Time evolution of the Dirichlet energy**\n\nThe time-dependent Dirichlet energy is given by\n$$\nE(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{M} |\\mathrm{d}u(\\cdot,t)|_{h}^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}\n$$\nIn this expression, $|\\mathrm{d}u|_{h}^{2}$ is the squared Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the differential $\\mathrm{d}u$, which in local coordinates $(x^i)$ on $M$ and $(y^\\alpha)$ on $N$ can be written as $g^{ij} h_{\\alpha\\beta} \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial u^\\beta}{\\partial x^j}$. The inner product is taken in the fibers of the bundle $T^*M \\otimes u^{-1}TN$.\n\nWe compute the time derivative of $E(t)$ by differentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible as $u$ is smooth and $M$ is compact):\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{M} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\mathrm{d}u|_{h}^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} = \\int_{M} \\langle \\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\mathrm{d}u, \\mathrm{d}u \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the connection on the bundle $T^*M \\otimes u^{-1}TN$ induced by the Levi-Civita connections on $(M,g)$ and $(N,h)$.\n\nThis expression is the first variation of the energy functional. A fundamental result in the theory of harmonic maps states that the tension field $\\tau(u)$ is the negative of the $L^2$-gradient of the energy functional $E(u)$. Specifically, for any variation of the map $u$ given by a vector field $V$ along $u$ (i.e., $V(x) \\in T_{u(x)}N$), the variation of energy is\n$$\n\\delta_{V} E = -\\int_{M} \\langle \\tau(u), V \\rangle_{h} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}\n$$\nThis formula is derived by applying integration by parts (the divergence theorem) on the compact manifold $M$ without boundary, and relies on the metric compatibility of the connections ($\\nabla g = 0$ and $\\nabla h = 0$).\n\nFor the time evolution of $E(t)$, the variation is naturally given by the velocity field $V = \\partial_t u$. Therefore, we can write the time derivative of the energy as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}E(t) = -\\int_{M} \\langle \\tau(u(\\cdot,t)), \\partial_t u(\\cdot,t) \\rangle_{h} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the rate of change of the Dirichlet energy for any smooth family of maps $u(\\cdot, t)$.\n\nNext, we impose the condition that $u$ evolves according to the harmonic map heat flow, $\\partial_{t} u = \\tau(u)$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}E(t)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}E(t) = -\\int_{M} \\langle \\tau(u), \\tau(u) \\rangle_{h} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}E(t) = -\\int_{M} |\\tau(u(\\cdot,t))|_{h}^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}\n$$\nThis result shows that the Dirichlet energy is non-increasing along the harmonic map heat flow, since the integrand $|\\tau(u)|_{h}^{2}$ is non-negative.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the special case where $u(x,t) = u_0(x)$ is independent of $t$. As established in Part 1, a time-independent solution must satisfy the harmonic map equation $\\tau(u_0) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $u = u_0$ and $\\tau(u_0) = 0$ into the simplified expression for the energy derivative, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}E(t) = -\\int_{M} |\\tau(u_0)|_{h}^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} = -\\int_{M} |0|_{h}^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} = -\\int_{M} 0 \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} = 0\n$$\nThe rate of change of the Dirichlet energy for a time-independent solution to the heat flow is zero. This is consistent with the fact that such a solution is a critical point (a harmonic map) of the energy functional.\nThe resulting value is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3068441"}, {"introduction": "While abstract definitions provide a general framework, true mastery of geometric concepts often requires hands-on computation.

The problem states that for maps between flat manifolds, a map is harmonic if and only if its component functions have zero Laplacian.

In terms of their lifts, this means that for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the points $F_b(x)$ and $F_{b'}(x)$ must be equivalent in the target torus.

Since homotopy is an equivalence relation, all maps $f_b$ for $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are in the same homotopy class.\nWe have constructed a continuous family of distinct harmonic maps, all lying within the same homotopy class. This demonstrates that for a target manifold with zero sectional curvature (like the flat torus), a harmonic map within a given homotopy class is not necessarily unique.\n\nThird, we compute the common energy $E(f_b)$ for all $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The Dirichlet energy is given by:\n$$\nE(f_b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} |df_b|^{2} \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_{g}\n$$\nThe term $|df_b|^2$ is the squared Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the differential of $f_b$. In the standard Euclidean coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ on the domain and $(y_1, y_2)$ on the target, which are orthonormal for the flat metrics, this norm is given by the sum of the squares of the entries of the Jacobian matrix of the map. Let $J_b$ be the Jacobian matrix of the lift $F_b(x_1, x_2) = (x_1+b_1, x_2+b_2)$.\n$$\nJ_b = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial (x_1+b_1)}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial (x_1+b_1)}{\\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial (x_2+b_2)}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial (x_2+b_2)}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the identity matrix $I$. The squared norm is the trace of $J_b^T J_b$, which is $\\mathrm{Tr}(I^T I) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I) = 1+1=2$. In terms of partial derivatives:\n$$\n|df_b|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial x_1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial x_2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_2}\\right)^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 2\n$$\nThe value of $|df_b|^2$ is constant over the entire torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ and is independent of the vector $b$. We can now compute the integral for the energy:\n$$\nE(f_b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} 2 \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_{g} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} 1 \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_{g} = \\mathrm{Area}(\\mathbb{T}^{2})\n$$\nThe domain of integration is the torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2} = \\mathbb{R}^{2} / \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. Its area is the area of a fundamental domain, for example the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The volume element $d\\mathrm{vol}_{g}$ in these coordinates is simply $dx_1 dx_2$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}(\\mathbb{T}^{2}) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 dx_1 dx_2 = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the energy of any map $f_b$ is:\n$$\nE(f_b) = 1\n$$\nThis value is indeed common for all $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3068431"}]}
