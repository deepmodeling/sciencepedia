The PMT states that for a complete, asymptotically flat $3$-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature ($R_g \\ge 0$), the total ADM mass is nonnegative. The hypothesis $R_g \\ge 0$ is physically motivated, corresponding to the dominant energy condition for matter fields in general relativity, which roughly states that local energy density is nonnegative and does not flow faster than light.\n\nIn the conformally flat case we have studied ($g=u^4\\delta$), our derivation shows that the abstract geometric and physical condition of nonnegative scalar curvature ($R_g \\ge 0$) is equivalent to a simple and concrete analytic condition on the conformal factor $u$: that it must be superharmonic ($\\Delta u \\le 0$) with respect to the background Euclidean metric. This transformation of the problem's central hypothesis from geometry to potential theory is a crucial simplification. It allows one to prove the PMT for this class of manifolds by analyzing properties of superharmonic functions on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that satisfy the asymptotic condition $u(x) \\to 1$ as $|x|\\to\\infty$. For example, the spatial Schwarzschild metric of mass $m  0$ can be written in this form with $u(x)=1 + \\frac{m}{2|x|}$ outside the origin, for which $\\Delta u = 0$ (implying $R_g=0$) and whose ADM mass is precisely $m$. The condition $\\Delta u \\le 0$ prevents the kind of behavior that would correspond to a negative total mass.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-8u^{-5}\\Delta u} $$", "id": "3074402"}]}
