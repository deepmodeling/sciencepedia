First, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for the given Dirichlet energy functional. Second, we use this equation to find a specific parameter for a given family of maps to be harmonic.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation**\n\nThe Dirichlet energy of a smooth map $u: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is given by\n$$E[u] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{a=1}^{m} \\partial_{i} u^{a}(x)\\,\\partial_{i} u^{a}(x)\\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThis can be written more compactly using the Einstein summation convention (summing over repeated indices) and the notation for the squared norm of the gradient, $|Du|^2 = \\partial_i u^a \\partial_i u^a$.\n$$E[u] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} |Du(x)|^2 \\mathrm{d}x$$\nA map $u$ is a critical point of the energy functional $E$ if the first variation of the energy vanishes for all admissible variations.

The condition that $\\varphi$ has compact support ensures that the variation does not alter the fixed boundary values of $u$, i.e., $u_t|_{\\partial\\Omega} = u|_{\\partial\\Omega}$.\n\nThe energy of the varied map $u_t$ is\n$$E[u_t] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{i,a} (\\partial_i (u^a + t\\varphi^a))^2 \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{i,a} (\\partial_i u^a + t\\partial_i \\varphi^a)^2 \\mathrm{d}x$$\nTo find the first variation, we differentiate $E[u_t]$ with respect to $t$ and evaluate at $t=0$.\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} E[u_t] = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{i,a} (\\partial_i u^a \\partial_i u^a + 2t \\partial_i u^a \\partial_i \\varphi^a + t^2 \\partial_i \\varphi^a \\partial_i \\varphi^a) \\mathrm{d}x \\right)$$\nDifferentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible here):\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} E[u_t] = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{i,a} (\\partial_i u^a \\partial_i \\varphi^a + t \\partial_i \\varphi^a \\partial_i \\varphi^a) \\mathrm{d}x$$\nEvaluating at $t=0$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d}{dt} E[u_t] \\right|_{t=0} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{i,a} \\partial_i u^a \\partial_i \\varphi^a \\mathrm{d}x$$\nFor $u$ to be a critical point, this first variation must be zero for all $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega, \\mathbb{R}^m)$.\n$$0 = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{a=1}^m \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^m \\partial_i u^a \\partial_i \\varphi^a \\right) \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThis is the weak form of the Euler-Lagrange equation.

An example of a stationary but not minimizing map is the inclusion $u:S^2\\hookrightarrow S^3$ of a totally geodesic equatorial $S^2\\subset S^3$ with the round metrics, which is harmonic but null-homotopic, so it is not minimizing in its homotopy class (the constant map has strictly smaller energy).**\n\nThis option provides a correct and precise distinction between minimizing and stationary harmonic maps, and correctly states that minimizing implies stationary.\nLet's analyze the example. Let $S^2$ be the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $S^3$ be the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The inclusion map $u: S^2 \\to S^3$ given by $(x,y,z) \\mapsto (x,y,z,0)$ maps $S^2$ to the \"equator\" of $S^3$.\n1.  **Stationary?** The image of $u$ is a totally geodesic submanifold of $S^3$. A map is harmonic if and only if its tension field vanishes. It is a standard result that a totally geodesic map is harmonic. Thus, $u$ is a stationary harmonic map.\n2.  **Minimizing?** We consider the homotopy class of $u$. The map $u$ is a map from $S^2$ to $S^3$. The homotopy classes of such maps are classified by the second homotopy group of the target, $\\pi_2(S^3)$. It is a fundamental result in algebraic topology that $\\pi_k(S^n) = 0$ for $k  n$. Here, $k=2$ and $n=3$, so $\\pi_2(S^3)=0$. This means that every map from $S^2$ to $S^3$ is homotopic to a constant map.\n3.  Let $c: S^2 \\to S^3$ be a constant map, e.g., $c(p) = (1,0,0,0)$ for all $p \\in S^2$. The map $c$ is in the same homotopy class as $u$. The Dirichlet energy of the constant map is $E(c) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{S^2} |dc|^2 dV_g = 0$, since its differential is zero.\n4.  The energy of the inclusion map $u$ is $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{S^2} |du|^2 dV_g$. Since $u$ is an isometric inclusion, $|du|^2$ is equal to the dimension of the domain, which is $2$. Thus, $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{S^2} 2 \\, dV_g = \\text{Area}(S^2) = 4\\pi$.\n5.  Since $E(u) = 4\\pi > E(c) = 0$, and both maps are in the same homotopy class, the map $u$ is not an energy-minimizing map in its homotopy class. The minimizer is any constant map.\n\nThe option's description and example are perfectly accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. A stationary harmonic map is one whose second variation of the Dirichlet energy is nonnegative for all variations, while a minimizing harmonic map may fail to be stationary. An example of a stationary but not minimizing map is the radial projection $u(x)=x/|x|$ from the unit ball $B^3\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^2$ with boundary data $u|_{\\partial B^3}=\\mathrm{id}_{S^2}$.**\n\nThe definitional part of this option is incorrect. A stationary map is a critical point (first variation is zero), not necessarily one with non-negative second variation. A stationary map with non-negative second variation is called a *stable* harmonic map. Furthermore, the claim that \"a minimizing harmonic map may fail to be stationary\" is fundamentally wrong; as established earlier, minimizers are always stationary points.\nThe example provided is the map $u(x) = x/|x|$ from the unit ball $B^3$ to $S^2$. This map is harmonic on $B^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. It belongs to the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(B^3, S^2)$ and is indeed a stationary point of the energy for maps with the identity map as boundary data. However, contrary to the premise of the example, it is known (by a result of Brezis, Coron, and Lieb) that this map is the unique **energy-minimizer** in its class $W^{1,2}(B^3,S^2;u|_{\\partial B^3})$. Therefore, the example is not a map that is stationary but non-minimizing; it is both stationary and minimizing.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In dimension $2$, conformal invariance implies that stationary harmonic maps always coincide with energy minimizers. For instance, any holomorphic map $u:S^2\\to S^2$ of degree $2$ is stationary and minimizing, so there are no examples of stationary but non-minimizing maps in this setting.**\n\nThe primary claim, \"In dimension $2$, ... stationary harmonic maps always coincide with energy minimizers,\" is false. While the Dirichlet energy for maps from a $2$-dimensional domain is conformally invariant, this does not imply that all stationary points are minimizers. For instance, Sacks and Uhlenbeck constructed unstable stationary harmonic maps from $S^2$ into certain target manifolds $N$ (where $\\pi_2(N) \\neq 0$), which are not minimizers. The example of Option A itself is a map from a $2$-dimensional domain ($S^2$) which is stationary but not minimizing.\nThe specific example given, a holomorphic map $u: S^2 \\to S^2$, is indeed both stationary (as holomorphic maps between Kähler manifolds are harmonic) and energy-minimizing in its homotopy class. However, this is a special case (domain and target are $S^2$) and is incorrectly used to justify the false general assertion that \"there are no examples of stationary but non-minimizing maps in this setting\" (i.e., dimension $2$ domains).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Stationary harmonic maps are minimizers only under domain reparametrizations (not target variations). An example is a great circle $u:S^1\\to S^2$, which is stationary and energy-minimizing in its homotopy class among loops in $S^2$.**\n\nThe first sentence is conceptually confused. The definition of a stationary map relies on target variations (variations of the map $u$), and the concept of being a minimizer is not linked to domain reparametrizations in this way.\nThe example is also incorrect. A great circle, parametrized proportionally to arc length, is a closed geodesic on $S^2$. As such, it is a harmonic map from $S^1$ to $S^2$. However, we must check if it is energy-minimizing in its homotopy class. Similar to the analysis in Option A, we must consider the relevant homotopy group, which is $\\pi_1(S^2)$. Since the sphere $S^2$ is simply connected, $\\pi_1(S^2) = \\{0\\}$. This means any loop, including a great circle, is homotopic to a constant loop. A constant loop has zero energy. A great circle has a non-zero length, so its energy is strictly positive. Therefore, a great circle is not energy-minimizing in its homotopy class. The option incorrectly claims it is.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3033071"}]}
