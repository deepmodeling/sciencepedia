We compute the terms in the Yamabe functional for this specific case.\n1.  **Scalar Curvature:** Since the metric $g$ on the torus $T^n$ is flat, its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, its scalar curvature is zero: $R_g = 0$.\n2.  **Gradient Term:** Since $u=c$ is a constant function, its gradient is identically zero: $\\nabla u = 0$. Therefore, the norm of the gradient is also zero: $|\\nabla u|_{g}^{2} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E_g(u)$:\n$$E_{g}(c) = \\frac{\\int_{T^{n}} (a_{n} |\\nabla c|_{g}^{2} + R_{g} c^{2}) \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g}}{\\left(\\int_{T^{n}} c^{p} \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g}\\right)^{2/p}} = \\frac{\\int_{T^{n}} (a_{n} \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot c^{2}) \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g}}{\\left(\\int_{T^{n}} c^{p} \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g}\\right)^{2/p}}$$\nThe numerator simplifies to:\n$$\\int_{T^{n}} 0 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g} = 0$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\\left(\\int_{T^{n}} c^{p} \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g}\\right)^{2/p} = \\left(c^{p} \\int_{T^{n}} \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g}\\right)^{2/p} = \\left(c^{p} \\mathrm{Vol}(T^{n}, g)\\right)^{2/p} = c^{2} (\\mathrm{Vol}(T^{n}, g))^{2/p}$$\nSince $c > 0$ and the volume of the torus is positive, the denominator is non-zero.\nTherefore, the value of the Yamabe functional for any positive constant function is:\n$$E_{g}(c) = \\frac{0}{c^{2} (\\mathrm{Vol}(T^{n}, g))^{2/p}} = 0$$\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Yamabe Constant $Y(T^n, [g])$ and Interpretation**\n\nFor the flat torus $(T^n, g)$, we have $R_g = 0$.

The constant $a_{n} = 4\\frac{n-1}{n-2}$ is positive for $n \\ge 3$.\n2.

The integral $\\int_{T^{n}} |\\nabla u|_{g}^{2} \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g}$ is therefore always non-negative. This means the numerator of $E_g(u)$ is non-negative.\n4.  For a smooth positive function $u$, the denominator $(\\int_{T^{n}} u^{p} \\mathrm{d}\\mu_{g})^{2/p}$ is always strictly positive.\n5.  Combining these observations, we conclude that $E_{g}(u) \\ge 0$ for any smooth positive function $u$ on the flat torus.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that the value $0$ is achieved by the functional for any positive constant function $u=c$. Since $E_g(u)$ is always non-negative and can be equal to $0$, the infimum of $E_g(u)$ over all smooth positive functions must be $0$.\n\nThus, the Yamabe constant of the flat torus is:\n$$Y(T^{n}, [g]) = \\inf_{u \\in C^{\\infty}(T^n), u>0} E_{g}(u) = 0$$\n\n**Interpretation of the sign:**\nThe solution of the Yamabe problem (by Yamabe, Trudinger, Aubin, Schoen) states that for any compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with $n \\ge 3$, there exists a metric $\\tilde{g}$ in the conformal class $[g]$ (i.e., $\\tilde{g} = u^{p-2}g$ for some smooth $u>0$) that has constant scalar curvature. The sign of this constant scalar curvature is determined by the sign of the Yamabe constant $Y(M, [g])$.\n- If $Y(M,[g]) > 0$, there exists a conformal metric with positive constant scalar curvature.\n- If $Y(M,[g]) = 0$, there exists a conformal metric with zero constant scalar curvature.\n- If $Y(M,[g])  0$, there exists a conformal metric with negative constant scalar curvature.\n\nIn our case, $Y(T^{n}, [g]) = 0$. This implies that the conformal class of the flat metric on the torus contains a representative with constant scalar curvature equal to zero. This is readily confirmed, as the original flat metric $g$ is itself a member of its conformal class $[g]$ (corresponding to $u=1$) and has scalar curvature $R_g=0$.

The fundamental principle of naturality states that geometric invariants constructed from the metric tensor transform naturally under diffeomorphisms. The Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature are such invariants. For a diffeomorphism $\\varphi: M \\to M$, the scalar curvature $s_{g_\\varphi}$ of the pullback metric $g_{\\varphi} = \\varphi^* g$ is related to the original scalar curvature $s_g$ by the pullback operation:\n    $$\n    s_{g_{\\varphi}} = \\varphi^{*}(s_g) = s_g \\circ \\varphi\n    $$\n    This means the value of $s_{g_{\\varphi}}$ at a point $x \\in M$ is equal to the value of $s_g$ at the point $\\varphi(x)$.\n\n2.  **Gradient Norm:** We need to relate $|\\nabla^{g_{\\varphi}} (u \\circ \\varphi)|_{g_{\\varphi}}$ to quantities involving the original metric $g$.
