Express your final answer as a single exact number with no units, and do not round.", "solution": "The problem asks for the injectivity radius of the flat $n$-torus $T^{n}=\\mathbb{R}^{n}/\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ at any point. The torus is endowed with the Riemannian metric induced from the standard Euclidean inner product on its universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Due to the homogeneity of the torus (the group of isometries acts transitively), the injectivity radius is constant for all points $p \\in T^n$. We can therefore perform the computation at a specific, convenient point, such as $p_0 = \\pi(0)$, where $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T^n$ is the canonical covering projection and $0$ is the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe injectivity radius at a point $p$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, denoted $\\text{inj}(p)$, is defined as the supremum of radii $r > 0$ for which the exponential map $\\exp_p: B(0, r) \\subset T_pM \\to M$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image. Here, $T_pM$ is the tangent space at $p$ and $B(0, r)$ is the open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin of $T_pM$.\n\nFor the flat torus $T^n$, the tangent space at any point can be canonically identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let us make this identification at our chosen point $p_0$: $T_{p_0}T^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$. Geodesics on $T^n$ starting at $p_0$ with an initial velocity vector $v \\in T_{p_0}T^n$ are the projections of straight lines in the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^n$ starting at the origin $0$ with velocity $v$. The straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the path $\\gamma_v(t) = t v$. The corresponding geodesic on the torus is $\\pi(\\gamma_v(t))$. The exponential map therefore takes a simple form: for a vector $v \\in T_{p_0}T^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$, the point reached after time $1$ along the geodesic is $\\exp_{p_0}(v) = \\pi(v)$.\n\nThe exponential map $\\exp_{p_0}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T^n$ fails to be injective if there exist two distinct vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\exp_{p_0}(v_1) = \\exp_{p_0}(v_2)$. Using the explicit form of the exponential map, this condition becomes $\\pi(v_1) = \\pi(v_2)$. By the definition of the quotient manifold $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$, two points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ project to the same point in $T^n$ if and only if their difference is a non-zero vector in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Thus, $\\pi(v_1) = \\pi(v_2)$ for $v_1 \\neq v_2$ is equivalent to $v_1 - v_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nWe seek the largest radius $r > 0$ such that the map $\\exp_{p_0}$ is injective on the open ball $B(0, r) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. This means that for any two distinct vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in B(0, r)$, their difference $v_1 - v_2$ must not be a non-zero lattice vector. The set of all possible differences $\\{v_1 - v_2 \\mid v_1, v_2 \\in B(0,r)\\}$ is the open ball $B(0, 2r)$. Therefore, the condition for injectivity on $B(0,r)$ is that the ball $B(0, 2r)$ contains no non-zero lattice points:\n$$\nB(0, 2r) \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset\n$$\nThis implies that the radius $2r$ must be less than or equal to the norm of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Let $\\|k\\|$ be the standard Euclidean norm of a vector $k \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The condition is:\n$$\n2r \\le \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|k\\|\n$$\nThe injectivity radius $\\text{inj}(p_0)$ is the supremum of all such $r$. This gives:\n$$\n\\text{inj}(p_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|k\\|\n$$\nThis result connects the injectivity radius to the geometry of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Geometrically, the injectivity radius is half the length of the shortest non-trivial geodesic loop based at $p_0$. A geodesic loop at $p_0$ corresponds to a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ from the origin $0$ to some lattice point $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The length of this loop is $\\|k\\|$. The shortest such loop corresponds to the lattice vector $k$ with the minimum non-zero norm.\n\nThe problem requires justification using the Dirichlet-Voronoi cell. The Dirichlet-Voronoi cell of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ centered at the origin is the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that are closer to the origin than to any other lattice point:\n$$\nD = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\|x\\| \\le \\|x-k\\| \\text{ for all } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}\n$$\nThe interior of $D$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and the projection map $\\pi$ is injective on this interior. The injectivity radius at $p_0$ is the radius of the largest open ball centered at the origin that can be inscribed within this fundamental domain. The boundary of the Voronoi cell is composed of portions of the perpendicular bisector hyperplanes for segments connecting the origin to other lattice points $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The point on the boundary of $D$ closest to the origin will lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment $[0, k_0]$, where $k_0$ is a shortest non-zero lattice vector. This closest point is precisely the midpoint $\\frac{1}{2}k_0$. The distance from the origin to this point is $\\|\\frac{1}{2}k_0\\| = \\frac{1}{2}\\|k_0\\|$. This distance is the radius of the inscribed ball, which is the injectivity radius.\n\nNow, we compute this value. A vector in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is of the form $k = (k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n)$ where each $k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The squared norm is $\\|k\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n k_i^2$. We need to find the minimum of this value for $k \\neq 0$. Since the components $k_i$ are integers, the smallest possible non-zero value for any $k_i^2$ is $1^2=1$. To minimize the sum, we can choose one component to be $\\pm 1$ and all other components to be $0$. For example, let $k_0 = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$. The norm is $\\|k_0\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2} = 1$. Any other non-zero lattice vector would have a norm greater than or equal to $1$. For instance, if two components are non-zero (e.g., $(1,1,0,\\dots,0)$), the norm is $\\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2} > 1$. If one component has magnitude $2$, the norm is $2 > 1$. Therefore, the minimum non-zero norm is indeed $1$:\n$$\n\\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|k\\| = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the injectivity radius:\n$$\n\\text{inj}(p_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nAs argued earlier, the injectivity radius is constant over the entire torus $T^n$.

It is a standard problem in Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis. We proceed with the solution by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nThe Riemannian metric on $S^1$ is given by $g_i = a_i(\\theta)^2 d\\theta^2$, where $a_i(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{i}(2 + \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nFirst, we explain the change of variable to an arc-length coordinate. The element of arc-length $ds$ on $(S^1, g_i)$ is given by $ds = \\sqrt{g_i(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta})} d\\theta$. Substituting the expression for $g_i$, we get $ds = \\sqrt{a_i(\\theta)^2} d\\theta$. Since it is given that $a_i(\\theta) > 0$ for all $\\theta$, this simplifies to $ds = a_i(\\theta) d\\theta$.\nThe suggested change of variable is $s(\\theta) = \\int_{0}^{\\theta} a_i(\\varphi) d\\varphi$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, differentiating $s$ with respect to $\\theta$ yields $\\frac{ds}{d\\theta} = a_i(\\theta)$. Therefore, we have $ds = a_i(\\theta) d\\theta$, which confirms that $s$ is the arc-length parameter.\nWe can express the metric tensor $g_i$ in terms of the coordinate $s$. From $ds = a_i(\\theta)d\\theta$, we have $d\\theta = \\frac{ds}{a_i(\\theta)}$. Substituting this into the expression for $g_i$:\n$$\ng_i = a_i(\\theta)^2 (d\\theta)^2 = a_i(\\theta)^2 \\left( \\frac{ds}{a_i(\\theta)} \\right)^2 = ds^2.\n$$\nThe coordinate $\\theta$ spans the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. The new coordinate $s$ thus spans the interval $[s(0), s(2\\pi))$, which is $[0, L_i)$, where $L_i$ is the total length of the circle:\n$$\nL_i = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} a_i(\\theta) d\\theta.\n$$\nThe identification of $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=2\\pi$ on the original circle corresponds to the identification of $s=0$ and $s=L_i$. Thus, the change of variables $s(\\theta)$ establishes an isometry between the Riemannian manifold $(S^1, g_i)$ and a circle of circumference $L_i$ equipped with the standard flat metric $ds^2$. This latter space can be represented as the quotient space $\\mathbb{R} / (L_i \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nNext, we deduce the relationship between the injectivity radius and the total length for any smooth metric on $S^1$. As shown above, any such manifold $(S^1, g)$ is isometric to a flat circle of circumference $L = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{g_{\\theta\\theta}} d\\theta$. Let us analyze the injectivity radius on this flat circle.\nLet $p$ be a point on the circle. The tangent space $T_p S^1$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space, which we can identify with $\\mathbb{R}$. The exponential map $\\exp_p: T_p S^1 \\to S^1$ sends a tangent vector $v \\in T_p S^1$ to the point on the circle reached by traveling along the unique geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v$, for a time duration of $1$. In terms of arc-length, this is equivalent to sending $t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cong T_p S^1$ to the point at a signed distance $t$ from $p$.\nThe injectivity radius at $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{inj}_p(S^1, g)$, is the supremum of all radii $r > 0$ such that the exponential map $\\exp_p$ restricted to the open ball $B(0, r) \\subset T_p S^1$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image. For a $1$-dimensional manifold, this ball is the open interval $(-r, r)$.\nThe map $\\exp_p: (-r, r) \\to S^1$ is injective if and only if for any distinct $t_1, t_2 \\in (-r, r)$, the points at signed distances $t_1$ and $t_2$ from $p$ are distinct. On a circle of circumference $L$, two path lengths $t_1$ and $t_2$ lead to the same point if and only if their difference is an integer multiple of $L$, i.e., $t_1 - t_2 = kL$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor injectivity of $\\exp_p$ on $(-r, r)$, we require that for any $t_1, t_2 \\in (-r, r)$ with $t_1 \\neq t_2$, $t_1 - t_2$ is not a multiple of $L$. The difference $t_1 - t_2$ can take any value in the interval $(-2r, 2r)$. To prevent this difference from being a non-zero multiple of $L$, we must have $2r \\le L$, which implies $r \\le \\frac{L}{2}$.\nThe supremum of such $r$ for which $\\exp_p$ is injective on $(-r,r)$ is therefore $\\frac{L}{2}$. The cut locus of any point $p$ on the circle is its unique antipodal point, which is at distance $\\frac{L}{2}$. This distance is the injectivity radius at $p$. Since the circle is homogeneous, the injectivity radius is the same for all points. Thus, for any metric on $S^1$, the injectivity radius is half the total length:\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}(S^1, g_i) = \\frac{L_i}{2}.\n$$\n\nNow we compute $L_i$ and $\\operatorname{inj}(S^1, g_i)$ for the given family of metrics.\n$$\nL_i = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} a_i(\\theta) d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{i}(2 + \\cos\\theta) d\\theta = \\frac{1}{i} \\left[ 2\\theta + \\sin\\theta \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{i} \\bigl( (4\\pi + \\sin(2\\pi)) - (0 + \\sin(0)) \\bigr) = \\frac{4\\pi}{i}.\n$$\nUsing the relationship derived above, the injectivity radius is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}(S^1, g_i) = \\frac{L_i}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{i} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{i}.\n$$\n\nFinally, we identify the collapse mechanism and compute the limit. In Cheeger-Gromov compactness theory, a sequence of Riemannian manifolds $(M_i, g_i)$ with uniformly bounded curvature and diameter is said to collapse if the Gromov-Hausdorff limit is a space of lower dimension. A key indicator of collapse is the injectivity radius tending to zero. In our case, the Ricci curvature is identically zero for all $i$ (as it is for any $1$-dimensional manifold), so the curvature is uniformly bounded. The injectivity radius is $\\operatorname{inj}(S^1, g_i) = \\frac{2\\pi}{i}$, which clearly tends to $0$ as $i \\to \\infty$. This is the geometric mechanism for the collapse: the manifold is shrinking at all length scales.\nThe diameter of $(S^1, g_i)$ is half its circumference, $\\operatorname{diam}(S^1, g_i) = \\frac{L_i}{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{i}$. Since the diameter also tends to $0$, the sequence of metric spaces $(S^1, g_i)$ collapses to a single point in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nThe problem asks for the limit of the injectivity radius.\n$$\n\\lim_{i\\to\\infty} \\operatorname{inj}(S^1, g_i) = \\lim_{i\\to\\infty} \\frac{2\\pi}{i} = 0.\n$$\nThe value of this limit is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3042338"}, {"introduction": "Collapsing phenomena can be much richer than simply shrinking to a point.

That is, $x_1-x_2 = k\\varepsilon_i$ and $y_1-y_2 = mL$ for some integers $k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The distance $d_i$ on $T_i^2$ is the quotient metric inherited from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe circle $S^1_L = \\mathbb{R} / L\\mathbb{Z}$ consists of equivalence classes $[y]_S$ of real numbers, where $y_1 \\sim y_2$ if $y_1-y_2 = mL$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The distance $d_S$ is the standard quotient metric.\n\n**Step 1: Construction of the maps $p_i : T_i^2 \\to S^1_L$**\n\nWe define a map from the universal covers, $\\tilde{p} : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, by projecting onto the second coordinate: $\\tilde{p}((x,y)) = y$. We wish to show this descends to a well-defined map $p_i: T_i^2 \\to S^1_L$.\nLet $[(x_1,y_1)]_i = [(x_2,y_2)]_i$ be two representations of the same point in $T_i^2$. Then, for some integers $k$ and $m$, we have $x_2 = x_1 + k\\varepsilon_i$ and $y_2 = y_1+mL$.\nThe image of $(x_1,y_1)$ under $\\tilde{p}$ is $y_1$. The image of $(x_2,y_2)$ is $y_2 = y_1+mL$. In the quotient space $S^1_L = \\mathbb{R}/L\\mathbb{Z}$, the points $y_1$ and $y_1+mL$ belong to the same equivalence class, i.e., $[y_1]_S = [y_1+mL]_S$.\nThus, the map $p_i([(x,y)]_i) = [y]_S$ is well-defined.\n\nNext, we show that $p_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz. Let $P_1 = [(x_1,y_1)]_i$ and $P_2 = [(x_2,y_2)]_i$ be two points in $T_i^2$. Their distance is\n$$d_i(P_1,P_2) = \\min_{k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sqrt{(x_1 - (x_2+k\\varepsilon_i))^2 + (y_1-(y_2+mL))^2}$$\nThe distance between their images $p_i(P_1)=[y_1]_S$ and $p_i(P_2)=[y_2]_S$ is\n$$d_S([y_1]_S, [y_2]_S) = \\min_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |y_1 - (y_2+mL)|$$\nLet $k_0, m_0$ be the integers that realize the minimum for $d_i(P_1, P_2)$. Then\n$$d_i(P_1,P_2) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2 - k_0\\varepsilon_i)^2 + (y_1-y_2-m_0L)^2} \\ge \\sqrt{0 + (y_1-y_2-m_0L)^2} = |y_1-y_2-m_0L|$$\nBy definition of the minimum, we have $|y_1-y_2-m_0L| \\ge \\min_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |y_1-y_2-mL| = d_S([y_1]_S, [y_2]_S)$.\nCombining these inequalities, we get $d_i(P_1,P_2) \\ge d_S(p_i(P_1), p_i(P_2))$. This shows that $p_i$ is a $1$-Lipschitz map. The map is also surjective since for any $[y]_S \\in S^1_L$, the point $[(0,y)]_i \\in T_i^2$ maps to it.\n\n**Step 2: Diameter of the fibers of $p_i$**\n\nA fiber of $p_i$ over a point $[y_0]_S \\in S^1_L$ is the set $p_i^{-1}([y_0]_S) = \\{[(x,y)]_i \\in T_i^2 \\mid [y]_S=[y_0]_S\\}$.\nWe can choose a representative for each point in the fiber of the form $(x,y_0)$. The set of such points is $\\{[(x,y_0)]_i \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\nTwo such points $[(x_1,y_0)]_i$ and $[(x_2,y_0)]_i$ are identical if and only if $x_1-x_2 = k\\varepsilon_i$ and $y_0-y_0 = mL$ for some integers $k,m$. The second condition implies $m=0$.\nSo the equivalence relation on the fiber is purely on the first coordinate: $x_1 \\sim x_2$ if $x_1-x_2=k\\varepsilon_i$.\nThis means the fiber is the space $\\mathbb{R}/\\varepsilon_i\\mathbb{Z}$ equipped with the metric induced by the standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}$. This space is a circle of circumference $\\varepsilon_i$.\nThe diameter of a circle of circumference $C$ is $C/2$. Therefore, the diameter of any fiber $p_i^{-1}([y_0]_S)$ is $\\varepsilon_i/2$.\nThis shows that $\\sup_{[y]_S \\in S^1_L} \\text{diam}(p_i^{-1}([y]_S)) = \\varepsilon_i/2$, confirming the required bound.\n\n**Step 3: Gromov–Hausdorff Convergence**\n\nTo show that $d_{GH}(T_i^2, S^1_L) \\to 0$ as $i \\to \\infty$, we estimate the distortion of the correspondence defined by the graph of $p_i$. Let $C_i = \\{(P,Q) \\in T_i^2 \\times S^1_L \\mid p_i(P)=Q\\}$. This is a correspondence since $p_i$ is surjective. The distortion is $\\text{dis}(C_i) = \\sup |d_i(P_1,P_2) - d_S(Q_1,Q_2)|$ where $(P_1,Q_1),(P_2,Q_2) \\in C_i$.\nWe have $d_S(p_i(P_1),p_i(P_2)) \\le d_i(P_1,P_2)$.\nFor the other inequality, let $P_1=[(x_1,y_1)]_i$ and $P_2=[(x_2,y_2)]_i$. The distance from $P_1$ to the fiber $p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))$ is\n$$d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))) = \\inf_{P' \\in p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))} d_i(P_1, P') = d_S(p_i(P_1), p_i(P_2))$$\nThis holds because the projection $p_i$ is a Riemannian submersion. To demonstrate from basics:\n$$d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}([y_2]_S))^2 = \\inf_{u \\in \\mathbb{R}, k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\|(x_1,y_1) - ((u,y_2) + (k\\varepsilon_i, mL))\\|^2$$\n$$= \\inf_{u, k, m} ((x_1-u-k\\varepsilon_i)^2 + (y_1-y_2-mL)^2)$$\nThe infimum over $u$ and $k$ makes the first term $0$. Thus,\n$$d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}([y_2]_S))^2 = \\inf_m (y_1-y_2-mL)^2 = (\\min_m |y_1-y_2-mL|)^2 = d_S([y_1]_S, [y_2]_S)^2$$\nLet $P_2'$ be a point in the fiber $p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))$ such that $d_i(P_1,P_2') = d_i(P_1, p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2)))$. Such a point exists by compactness of the fiber.\nUsing the triangle inequality:\n$$d_i(P_1,P_2) \\le d_i(P_1,P_2') + d_i(P_2',P_2)$$\nWe have $d_i(P_1,P_2') = d_S(p_i(P_1), p_i(P_2))$. Since $P_2$ and $P_2'$ lie in the same fiber, $d_i(P_2',P_2) \\le \\text{diam}(p_i^{-1}(p_i(P_2))) = \\varepsilon_i/2$.\nSo, $d_i(P_1,P_2) \\le d_S(p_i(P_1),p_i(P_2)) + \\varepsilon_i/2$. This gives $|d_i(P_1,P_2) - d_S(p_i(P_1),p_i(P_2))| \\le \\varepsilon_i/2$.\nThe distortion is bounded, $\\text{dis}(C_i) \\le \\varepsilon_i/2$.\nBy definition of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{GH}(T_i^2, S^1_L) = \\frac{1}{2}\\inf_C \\text{dis}(C) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\text{dis}(C_i) \\le \\frac{1}{2}(\\varepsilon_i/2) = \\varepsilon_i/4$.\nSince $\\varepsilon_i \\to 0$ as $i \\to \\infty$, we have $\\lim_{i\\to\\infty} d_{GH}(T_i^2, S^1_L) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: The limiting space and its radius**\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the sequence $\\{T_i^2\\}$ is the metric space $(S^1_L, d_S)$. The space $S^1_L = \\mathbb{R}/L\\mathbb{Z}$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold. Its total length, or circumference, is the length of the fundamental domain $[0,L)$, which is $L$.\nThe problem states that this limit is isometric to a round circle $S^1_R$ of some radius $R$. A round circle of radius $R$ in the Euclidean plane has a circumference of $2\\pi R$.\nFor two metric circles to be isometric, their circumferences must be equal. Therefore, we must equate the circumference of the limit space $S^1_L$ to the circumference of the round circle $S^1_R$.\n$$L = 2\\pi R$$\nSolving for the radius $R$ gives:\n$$R = \\frac{L}{2\\pi}$$\n\nThis is the exact analytic expression for the radius of the limiting circle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{L}{2\\pi}}$$", "id": "3042365"}]}
