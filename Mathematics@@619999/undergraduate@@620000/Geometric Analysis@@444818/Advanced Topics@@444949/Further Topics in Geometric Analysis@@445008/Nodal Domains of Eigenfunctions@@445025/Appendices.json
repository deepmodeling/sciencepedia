It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all terms are well-defined. The necessary data, including the differential equation, the domain, and the boundary conditions, are provided without ambiguity or contradiction. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem is to find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ and eigenfunctions $u$ for the Dirichlet problem of the Laplacian on a rectangular domain $\\Omega = [0,a]\\times[0,b]$, where $a0$ and $b0$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n-\\Delta u = \\lambda u \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega\n$$\nwhich can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right) = \\lambda u\n$$\nThe boundary condition is $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$, which means $u(x,y)=0$ if $x=0$, $x=a$, $y=0$, or $y=b$.\n\nWe are instructed to use the method of separation of variables. We assume a non-trivial solution of the form $u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the partial differential equation gives:\n$$\n-X''(x)Y(y) - X(x)Y''(y) = \\lambda X(x)Y(y)\n$$\nwhere $X''(x) = \\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2}$ and $Y''(y) = \\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2}$. Dividing by the non-zero product $X(x)Y(y)$ yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged as:\n$$\n-\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\lambda + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\n$$\nThe left side of this equation is a function of $x$ only, while the right side is a function of $y$ only. For the equality to hold for all $(x,y) \\in \\Omega$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $\\mu$. This separation leads to two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n(1) \\quad -\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\mu \\implies X''(x) + \\mu X(x) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\quad \\lambda + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\mu \\implies Y''(y) + (\\lambda - \\mu)Y(y) = 0\n$$\nLet's define a second separation constant $\\nu = \\lambda - \\mu$. Then the eigenvalue of the original problem is $\\lambda = \\mu + \\nu$, and the second ODE becomes $Y''(y) + \\nu Y(y) = 0$.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions.\nThe condition $u(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = 0$ for all $y \\in [0,b]$ implies $X(0)=0$, since $Y(y)$ cannot be identically zero for a non-trivial solution $u$.\nSimilarly, $u(a,y) = X(a)Y(y) = 0$ implies $X(a)=0$.\nThe condition $u(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,a]$ implies $Y(0)=0$.\nFinally, $u(x,b) = X(x)Y(b) = 0$ implies $Y(b)=0$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem for $X(x)$:\n$$\nX''(x) + \\mu X(x) = 0, \\quad X(0)=0, \\quad X(a)=0\n$$\nThis is a standard Sturm-Liouville problem. A non-trivial solution exists only if the constant $\\mu$ is positive. If $\\mu \\le 0$, the only solution satisfying the boundary conditions is the trivial solution $X(x)=0$. For $\\mu  0$, let $\\mu = k^2$ for some $k0$. The general solution is $X(x) = C_1\\cos(kx) + C_2\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$X(0) = C_1\\cos(0) + C_2\\sin(0) = C_1 = 0$.\nThe solution is thus $X(x) = C_2\\sin(kx)$.\n$X(a) = C_2\\sin(ka) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we need $C_2 \\neq 0$, so we must have $\\sin(ka)=0$.\nThis condition implies $ka = m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Since $k0$ and $a0$, $m$ must be a positive integer, $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe allowed values for $k$ are $k_m = \\frac{m\\pi}{a}$.\nThe eigenvalues for the $x$-problem are $\\mu_m = k_m^2 = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{a}\\right)^2$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_m(x) = C_m\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right)$, where $C_m$ is an arbitrary non-zero constant.\n\nThe boundary value problem for $Y(y)$ is analogous:\n$$\nY''(y) + \\nu Y(y) = 0, \\quad Y(0)=0, \\quad Y(b)=0\n$$\nA non-trivial solution requires $\\nu  0$. Let $\\nu = p^2$ for some $p0$. The general solution is $Y(y) = D_1\\cos(py) + D_2\\sin(py)$.\n$Y(0) = D_1 = 0$.\n$Y(b) = D_2\\sin(pb) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $\\sin(pb)=0$.\nThis implies $pb = n\\pi$ for some positive integer $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe allowed values for $p$ are $p_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{b}$.\nThe eigenvalues for the $y$-problem are $\\nu_n = p_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{b}\\right)^2$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $Y_n(y) = D_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right)$.\n\nCombining these results, the separated eigenfunctions for the Dirichlet Laplacian on the rectangle $\\Omega$ are indexed by the pair of positive integers $(m,n)$:\n$$\nu_{m,n}(x,y) = X_m(x)Y_n(y) = A_{m,n} \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A_{m,n}=C_m D_n$ is a normalization constant. The number of nodal domains is independent of this constant, so we can set $A_{m,n}=1$.\nThe corresponding eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{m,n} = \\mu_m + \\nu_n = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{b}\\right)^2 = \\pi^2\\left(\\frac{m^2}{a^2} + \\frac{n^2}{b^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must determine the number of nodal domains of the eigenfunction $u_{m,n}(x,y)$. A nodal domain is a connected component of the set $\\{(x,y) \\in \\Omega : u_{m,n}(x,y) \\neq 0\\}$. The boundaries of these domains are formed by the nodal set, which is the set of points where $u_{m,n}(x,y) = 0$.\nThe nodal set is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation holds if and only if $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) = 0$ or $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right) = 0$.\n\nThe first condition, $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) = 0$, is satisfied when $\\frac{m\\pi x}{a} = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. This implies $x = \\frac{k a}{m}$.\nSince $x \\in [0, a]$, the possible integer values for $k$ are $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$.\nThis gives a set of $m+1$ vertical nodal lines: $x=0, x=\\frac{a}{m}, x=\\frac{2a}{m}, \\ldots, x=a$.\nThe lines $x=0$ and $x=a$ are on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. The interior nodal lines are given by $x = \\frac{k a}{m}$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m-1\\}$. There are $m-1$ such interior vertical lines.\n\nThe second condition, $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right) = 0$, is satisfied when $\\frac{n\\pi y}{b} = j\\pi$ for some integer $j$. This implies $y = \\frac{j b}{n}$.\nSince $y \\in [0, b]$, the possible integer values for $j$ are $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\nThis gives a set of $n+1$ horizontal nodal lines: $y=0, y=\\frac{b}{n}, y=\\frac{2b}{n}, \\ldots, y=b$.\nThe lines $y=0$ and $y=b$ are on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. The interior nodal lines are given by $y = \\frac{j b}{n}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. There are $n-1$ such interior horizontal lines.\n\nThe total nodal set within the open rectangle $(0,a)\\times(0,b)$ is the union of these two sets of interior lines. These lines form a grid that partitions the rectangle $\\Omega$ into smaller, non-overlapping rectangular cells.\nThe $m-1$ interior vertical lines divide the rectangle into $m$ columns.\nThe $n-1$ interior horizontal lines divide the rectangle into $n$ rows.\nThe total number of small rectangular cells created by this grid is the product of the number of columns and the number of rows, which is $m \\times n$.\n\nWithin each of these small open rectangular cells, for example, a cell defined by $\\frac{(k-1)a}{m}  x  \\frac{ka}{m}$ and $\\frac{(j-1)b}{n}  y  \\frac{jb}{n}$ for $k \\in \\{1,\\ldots,m\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, neither $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right)$ nor $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right)$ is zero. Thus, $u_{m,n}(x,y)$ is non-zero throughout each cell. Since each cell is a connected set, and $u_{m,n}(x,y)$ has a constant sign within it (the sign pattern alternates like a checkerboard), each cell constitutes a single nodal domain.\nTherefore, the number of nodal domains is equal to the number of cells in this grid.\n\nThe number of nodal domains of the eigenfunction $u_{m,n}$ is $mn$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{mn}$$", "id": "3057225"}, {"introduction": "Courant's Nodal Domain Theorem provides a profound upper bound, stating that the $k$-th eigenfunction has at most $k$ nodal domains.

The tasks are to verify it is an eigenfunction, determine its index $k$ in the ordered spectrum, and find the number of its nodal domains to check for Courant sharpness. The final answer required is the number of nodal domains.\n\nFirst, we verify that $u(x,y)=\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y)$ is an eigenfunction of the problem $-\\Delta u = \\lambda u$ in $\\Omega$ with $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$.\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $u$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2\\cos(2x)\\sin(2y) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = -4\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y) = -4u(x,y)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 2\\sin(2x)\\cos(2y) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = -4\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y) = -4u(x,y)\n$$\nThe Laplacian of $u$ is given by $\\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$. Substituting the second derivatives, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta u = -4u(x,y) - 4u(x,y) = -8u(x,y)\n$$\nTherefore, $-\\Delta u = -(-8u) = 8u$. This matches the eigenvalue equation $-\\Delta u = \\lambda u$, which confirms that $u(x,y)=\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y)$ is an eigenfunction with the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda=8$.\n\nNext, we must verify the Dirichlet boundary condition, $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. The boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ consists of four line segments:\n1.  For $x=0$, $y \\in [0,\\pi]$: $u(0,y) = \\sin(2 \\cdot 0)\\sin(2y) = 0 \\cdot \\sin(2y) = 0$.\n2.  For $x=\\pi$, $y \\in [0,\\pi]$: $u(\\pi,y) = \\sin(2\\pi)\\sin(2y) = 0 \\cdot \\sin(2y) = 0$.\n3.  For $y=0$, $x \\in [0,\\pi]$: $u(x,0) = \\sin(2x)\\sin(2 \\cdot 0) = \\sin(2x) \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n4.  For $y=\\pi$, $x \\in [0,\\pi]$: $u(x,\\pi) = \\sin(2x)\\sin(2\\pi) = \\sin(2x) \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThe boundary condition is satisfied. Thus, $u(x,y)$ is a valid eigenfunction.\n\nThe second task is to determine the index $k$ of this eigenfunction. The eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\\Omega=(0,\\pi)\\times(0,\\pi)$ are given by $\\lambda_{m,n} = m^2+n^2$, corresponding to the eigenfunctions $u_{m,n}(x,y) = C \\sin(mx)\\sin(ny)$ for integers $m, n \\geq 1$. Our function $u(x,y)=\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y)$ corresponds to the pair $(m,n)=(2,2)$, with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2,2} = 2^2+2^2=8$.\n\nTo find the index $k$, we must list the eigenvalues in nondecreasing order, counting multiplicities and breaking ties for the pairs $(m,n)$ lexicographically. Let's list the first few eigenvalues:\n- For $(m,n)=(1,1)$: $\\lambda_{1,1} = 1^2+1^2 = 2$.\n- For $(m,n)=(1,2)$: $\\lambda_{1,2} = 1^2+2^2 = 5$.\n- For $(m,n)=(2,1)$: $\\lambda_{2,1} = 2^2+1^2 = 5$.\n- For $(m,n)=(2,2)$: $\\lambda_{2,2} = 2^2+2^2 = 8$.\n- For $(m,n)=(1,3)$: $\\lambda_{1,3} = 1^2+3^2 = 10$.\n- For $(m,n)=(3,1)$: $\\lambda_{3,1} = 3^2+1^2 = 10$.\n\nThe ordered list of eigenvalues begins: $2, 5, 5, 8, 10, 10, \\dots$. The problem specifies an ordering of the eigenfunctions (not just the distinct eigenvalues). We order them based on their corresponding $\\lambda_{m,n}$ value, and for a given $\\lambda$, we use lexicographical order on $(m,n)$.\n1.  The lowest eigenvalue is $\\lambda=2$, corresponding to $(m,n)=(1,1)$. This is the 1st eigenfunction. So, $k=1$ for $u_{1,1}$.\n2.  The next eigenvalue is $\\lambda=5$, which arises from two pairs: $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$. Applying the lexicographical tie-breaking rule ($m$ first), $(1,2)$ comes before $(2,1)$. Thus, $u_{1,2}$ is the 2nd eigenfunction ($k=2$) and $u_{2,1}$ is the 3rd eigenfunction ($k=3$).\n3.  The next eigenvalue is $\\lambda=8$, which arises only from the pair $(m,n)=(2,2)$. This eigenfunction, $u_{2,2}$, comes after the eigenfunctions for $\\lambda=5$. Therefore, the index for $u(x,y)=\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y)$ is $k=4$.\n\nThe third task is to determine the number of nodal domains of $u(x,y)=\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y)$ and check for Courant sharpness. A nodal domain is a connected component of the set where $u(x,y) \\neq 0$. The boundaries of these domains are formed by the nodal set, where $u(x,y)=0$.\nWe solve for $u(x,y)=0$ inside $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } (x,y) \\in (0,\\pi)\\times(0,\\pi)\n$$\nThis equation holds if and only if $\\sin(2x)=0$ or $\\sin(2y)=0$.\n- For $x \\in (0,\\pi)$, $\\sin(2x)=0$ implies $2x=j\\pi$ for some integer $j$. As $0x\\pi$, we have $02x2\\pi$, so $2x=\\pi$, which gives $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n- For $y \\in (0,\\pi)$, $\\sin(2y)=0$ implies $2y=l\\pi$ for some integer $l$. As $0y\\pi$, we have $02y2\\pi$, so $2y=\\pi$, which gives $y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe nodal set inside $\\Omega$ is the union of two line segments: $\\{ (x,y) \\in \\Omega \\mid x=\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\}$ and $\\{ (x,y) \\in \\Omega \\mid y=\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\}$. These two lines cross at the center of the square, $(\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, and partition the square $\\Omega$ into four smaller, open squares:\n1.  $\\Omega_1 = (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\times (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$\n2.  $\\Omega_2 = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi) \\times (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$\n3.  $\\Omega_3 = (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\times (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$\n4.  $\\Omega_4 = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi) \\times (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$\n\nIn each of these regions, the function $u(x,y)$ is non-zero. Let's check the sign:\n- In $\\Omega_1$: $x \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\Rightarrow 2x \\in (0,\\pi) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2x)0$. $y \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\Rightarrow 2y \\in (0,\\pi) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2y)0$. So $u(x,y)0$.\n- In $\\Omega_2$: $x \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi) \\Rightarrow 2x \\in (\\pi,2\\pi) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2x)0$. $y \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2y)0$. So $u(x,y)0$.\n- In $\\Omega_3$: $x \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2x)0$. $y \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi) \\Rightarrow 2y \\in (\\pi,2\\pi) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2y)0$. So $u(x,y)0$.\n- In $\\Omega_4$: $x \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2x)0$. $y \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi) \\Rightarrow \\sin(2y)0$. So $u(x,y)0$.\n\nSince each of these four regions is connected and $u$ has a constant sign within each, they are the nodal domains. The number of nodal domains is $4$.\n\nFinally, we check if $u$ is Courant sharp. An eigenfunction is Courant sharp if the number of its nodal domains equals its index $k$. We found the number of nodal domains to be $4$, and the index of the eigenfunction to be $k=4$. Since $4=4$, the eigenfunction $u(x,y)=\\sin(2x)\\sin(2y)$ is Courant sharp.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of nodal domains of $u$ in $\\Omega$.

Case $t=1$: Then the interior nodal set is given by\n$$\n\\cos(\\pi y) + \\cos(\\pi x) = 0.\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos A + \\cos B = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$ with $A=\\pi x$ and $B=\\pi y$, the equation becomes $2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x+y)}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x-y)}{2}\\right)=0$.\nThus interior zeros occur when either $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x+y)}{2}\\right)=0$ or $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x-y)}{2}\\right)=0$. The solutions on $(0,1)^{2}$ are:\n- $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x+y)}{2}\\right)=0 \\iff \\frac{\\pi(x+y)}{2}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k \\iff x+y=1+2k$, and the only viable choice in $(0,2)$ is $k=0$, giving the anti-diagonal line $x+y=1$ inside $\\Omega$.\n- $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x-y)}{2}\\right)=0 \\iff x-y=2k+1$, which yields $x-y=\\pm 1$. These lines lie on or outside the boundary and do not produce interior nodal curves except at boundary points.\n\nTherefore, the interior nodal set for $t=1$ is exactly the straight line $x+y=1$, which divides $\\Omega$ into two open right triangles. Thus,\n$$\nN(1)=2.\n$$\n\n3. Case $t=2$: The interior nodal set is\n$$\n\\cos(\\pi y) + 2\\cos(\\pi x) = 0 \\iff \\cos(\\pi y) = -2\\cos(\\pi x).\n$$\nSince $\\cos(\\pi x)\\in[-1,1]$, the right-hand side ranges in $[-2,2]$. For interior solutions we require $\\cos(\\pi y)\\in[-1,1]$, so the relation is solvable only when $|\\cos(\\pi x)|\\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. That happens for $x$ in the interval\n$x \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right),\\;1-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right] = \\left[\\frac{1}{3},\\;\\frac{2}{3}\\right]$.\nFor each such $x$, there is a unique $y\\in(0,1)$ satisfying $\\cos(\\pi y)=-2\\cos(\\pi x)$ because $y \\mapsto \\cos(\\pi y)$ is strictly decreasing from $1$ to $-1$ on $(0,1)$. Thus the interior nodal set is a single smooth curve that runs from near the top boundary at $x=\\frac{1}{3}$ (where $\\cos(\\pi x)=\\frac{1}{2}$ forces $\\cos(\\pi y)=-1$ so $y\\to 1$) down to near the bottom boundary at $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ (where $\\cos(\\pi x)=-\\frac{1}{2}$ forces $\\cos(\\pi y)=1$ so $y\\to 0$). A single interior curve connecting the top boundary to the bottom boundary splits the square into two connected open components (to the left and right of the curve). Therefore,\n$$\nN(2)=2.\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine $t_{\\ast}0$ such that $(x_{\\ast},y_{\\ast})=\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$ lies on the interior nodal set of $u_{t}$. This requires\n$$\n\\cos\\left(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\\right) + t_{\\ast} \\cos\\left(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nCompute the cosines: $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)=-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting gives\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} + t_{\\ast}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad t_{\\ast}=1.\n$$\n\nCollecting the results in the requested order, we have $(N(0),N(1),N(2),t_{\\ast}) = (2,2,2,1)$.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates explicitly how different linear combinations within a degenerate eigenspace produce different interior nodal sets (horizontal line for $t=0$, diagonal line for $t=1$, and a smooth curve connecting top and bottom for $t=2$), while in these cases the nodal domain count remains $2$. The change in nodal geometry is captured by the equation $\\cos(\\pi y) + t \\cos(\\pi x)=0$, and specific geometric features (such as passing through a prescribed interior point) follow by solving for $t$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}2  2  2  1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3057183"}]}
