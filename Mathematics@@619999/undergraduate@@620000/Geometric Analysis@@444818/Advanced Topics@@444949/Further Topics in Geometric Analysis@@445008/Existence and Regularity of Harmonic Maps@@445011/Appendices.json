Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a geodesic, which is a critical point of $E$. Let $\\gamma_s(t)$ be a smooth one-parameter family of curves such that $\\gamma_0(t) = \\gamma(t)$. The variation vector field is $V(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\gamma_s}{\\partial t}|_{s=0}$. We consider variations with fixed endpoints, so $V(0) = V(L) = 0$.\n\nThe energy of the varied curve is $E(s) = E(\\gamma_s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L} g(\\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}, \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}) dt$.\nThe first variation is $\\frac{dE}{ds} = \\int_{0}^{L} g(\\nabla_s \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}, \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}) dt$. Using the symmetry of the connection, $\\nabla_s \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt} = \\nabla_t \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{ds} = \\nabla_t V_s$. Integrating by parts gives:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{ds} = \\left[ g(V_s, \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}) \\right]_0^L - \\int_0^L g(V_s, \\nabla_t \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}) dt $$\nSince the endpoints are fixed, $V_s(0) = V_s(L) = 0$, the boundary term vanishes. At $s=0$, $\\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic, so $\\nabla_t \\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. This confirms the first variation is zero.\n\nThe second variation is $E''(0) = \\frac{d^2E}{ds^2}|_{s=0}$. Differentiating the expression for $\\frac{dE}{ds}$ with respect to $s$ and evaluating at $s=0$ yields:\n$$ E''(0) = - \\int_0^L \\left[ g(\\nabla_s V_s, \\nabla_t \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}) + g(V_s, \\nabla_s \\nabla_t \\frac{d\\gamma_s}{dt}) \\right]_{s=0} dt $$\nThe first term in the integrand vanishes at $s=0$ because $\\nabla_t \\frac{d\\gamma_0}{dt} = \\nabla_t \\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. We are left with:\n$$ E''(V) = - \\int_0^L g(V, \\nabla_s \\nabla_t \\dot{\\gamma_s})|_{s=0} dt $$\nUsing the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$ and the fact that the coordinate vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ commute, we have $\\nabla_s \\nabla_t \\dot{\\gamma_s} = \\nabla_t \\nabla_s \\dot{\\gamma_s} + R(\\frac{\\partial \\gamma_s}{\\partial s}, \\frac{\\partial \\gamma_s}{\\partial t})\\frac{\\partial \\gamma_s}{\\partial t}$. At $s=0$, this gives $\\nabla_s \\nabla_t \\dot{\\gamma_s}|_{s=0} = \\nabla_t \\nabla_t V + R(V,T)T$, where $T=\\dot{\\gamma}$. So,\n$$ E''(V) = - \\int_0^L g(V, \\nabla_t \\nabla_t V + R(V,T)T) dt $$\nIntegrating the term $g(V, \\nabla_t \\nabla_t V)$ by parts and using $V(0)=V(L)=0$, we get $\\int_0^L g(\\nabla_t V, \\nabla_t V) dt$. The final standard formula for the second variation is:\n$$ E''(V) = \\int_0^L \\left( g(\\nabla_t V, \\nabla_t V) - g(R(T,V)T, V) \\right) dt $$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the specific case given in the problem.\nThe variation vector field is $V(t) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi t}{L})N(t)$, where $L=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. For brevity, let $f(t) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi t}{L})$. So $V(t)=f(t)N(t)$.\nThe tangent vector field is $T(t)=\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$.\nThe vector field $N(t)$ along $\\gamma$ is parallel-transported, so $\\nabla_t N(t) = 0$. It is also a unit field, $|N(t)|=1$, and is orthogonal to $T(t)$, so $g(N(t), T(t))=0$.\nWe compute the two terms in the integrand:\n\n1.  The kinetic term: $g(\\nabla_t V, \\nabla_t V) = |\\nabla_t V|^2$.\n    Using the product rule for covariant derivatives:\n    $\\nabla_t V(t) = \\nabla_t(f(t)N(t)) = \\frac{df}{dt}N(t) + f(t)\\nabla_t N(t)$.\n    Since $\\nabla_t N(t) = 0$, we have $\\nabla_t V(t) = f'(t)N(t)$.\n    Then $|\\nabla_t V|^2 = g(f'(t)N(t), f'(t)N(t)) = (f'(t))^2 g(N(t),N(t)) = (f'(t))^2$, because $|N(t)|=1$.\n    With $f(t) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi t}{L})$, we have $f'(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{L}\\cos(\\frac{\\pi t}{L})$.\n    So, $|\\nabla_t V|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right)$.\n\n2.  The curvature term: $g(R(T,V)T, V)$.\n    Using the linearity of the curvature tensor in its second argument:\n    $R(T,V)T = R(T, f(t)N(t))T = f(t)R(T,N(t))T$.\n    So, $g(R(T,V)T, V) = g(f(t)R(T,N)T, f(t)N) = (f(t))^2 g(R(T,N)T, N)$.\n    The quantity $g(R(T,N)T,N)$ is the sectional curvature $K(T,N)$ of the plane spanned by the orthonormal vectors $T$ and $N$.\n    The problem states that $(M,g)=S^2$ has constant sectional curvature $K=1$. Thus, $g(R(T,N)T,N) = 1$.\n    The curvature term is therefore $(f(t))^2 \\cdot 1 = \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi t}{L})$.\n\nSubstituting these terms back into the second variation integral:\n$$ E''(V) = \\int_0^L \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) - \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right] dt $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the standard results $\\int_0^L \\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}) dt = \\frac{L}{2}$ and $\\int_0^L \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}) dt = \\frac{L}{2}$.\nThis gives:\n$$ E''(V) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{L}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} - 1 \\right) $$\nWe are given $L = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. Substituting this value:\n$$ L^2 = \\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9\\pi^2}{4} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{9\\pi^2/4} = \\frac{4}{9} $$\nSo the second variation is:\n$$ E''(V) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) \\left( \\frac{4}{9} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\left( -\\frac{5}{9} \\right) = -\\frac{15\\pi}{36} = -\\frac{5\\pi}{12} $$\n\nThe sign of the second variation indicates the stability of the geodesic as a critical point of the energy functional. A negative second variation for some non-trivial variation vector field implies that the geodesic is not a local minimum of energy; it is an unstable critical point (a saddle point). Our result $E''(V) = -\\frac{5\\pi}{12} < 0$ demonstrates that the geodesic segment $\\gamma$ of length $L=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ is unstable.\n\nThis instability is intimately related to the existence of conjugate points. A point $\\gamma(t_1)$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_1)=0$. Jacobi fields are solutions to the Jacobi equation $\\nabla_t^2 J + R(J,T)T = 0$. For a manifold of constant curvature $K$, the Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field $J(t)=y(t)N(t)$ simplifies to the scalar equation $y''(t) + K y(t) = 0$. On $S^2$, $K=1$, so $y''(t) + y(t) = 0$. The solution with $y(0)=0$ is $y(t) = c \\sin(t)$. This solution has zeros at $t=k\\pi$ for integers $k$. The first conjugate point to $\\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic occurs at $t=\\pi$.\nSince the length of our geodesic segment is $L=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, which is greater than $\\pi$, the segment extends beyond the first conjugate point. The Morse Index Theorem states that the index of the energy functional at a geodesic (the number of independent variations for which the second variation is negative) is equal to the number of conjugate points in the interior of the domain. In our case, the point $t=\\pi$ lies in the interval $(0, \\frac{3\\pi}{2})$, so the index is at least $1$. Our calculation explicitly finds a direction $V$ in the function space for which the second variation is negative, confirming this instability. A great circle arc on a sphere is length-minimizing only up to a length of $\\pi$.

The domain of integration $B_{r}(0)$ contains the singularity at the origin, so the integral is improper and must be evaluated as a limit.\n$$\nE(u; B_{r}(0)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{B_{r}(0)} |\\nabla u|^2 \\, dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{B_{r}(0) \\setminus B_{\\epsilon}(0)} |\\nabla u|^2 \\, dx\n$$\nUsing our previously calculated result $|\\nabla u|^2 = 2/|x|^2$:\n$$\nE(u; B_{r}(0)) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{B_{r}(0) \\setminus B_{\\epsilon}(0)} \\frac{2}{|x|^2} \\, dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{B_{r}(0) \\setminus B_{\\epsilon}(0)} \\frac{1}{|x|^2} \\, dx\n$$\nWe switch to spherical coordinates $( \\rho, \\phi, \\theta)$, where $|x| = \\rho$ and the volume element is $dx = \\rho^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\rho \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta$. The integration domain is $\\rho \\in [\\epsilon, r]$, $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi]$, and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n$$\nE(u; B_{r}(0)) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{\\epsilon}^{r} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\rho^2} (\\rho^2 \\sin(\\phi)) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, d\\rho\n$$\nThe factor $\\rho^2$ cancels out.\n$$\nE(u; B_{r}(0)) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{\\epsilon}^{r} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, d\\rho\n$$\nWe evaluate the integrals sequentially:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\phi = [-\\cos(\\phi)]_{0}^{\\pi} = -(-1) - (-1) = 2\n$$\n$$\nE(u; B_{r}(0)) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{\\epsilon}^{r} (2)(2\\pi) \\, d\\rho = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} 4\\pi \\int_{\\epsilon}^{r} d\\rho = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} 4\\pi [\\rho]_{\\epsilon}^{r} = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} 4\\pi (r - \\epsilon) = 4\\pi r\n$$\nSo, for $0 < r \\leq 1$, the energy is $E(u; B_{r}(0)) = 4\\pi r$.\nNote that for $r=1$, the total energy is $E(u; B_1(0)) = 4\\pi$, confirming the claim that our map is a minimizer.\n\nFinally, we compute the energy concentration (density) at the singularity, defined as:\n$$\n\\Theta(u,0) := \\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{E(u; B_{r}(0))}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting our result for the energy:\n$$\n\\Theta(u,0) = \\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{4\\pi r}{r} = \\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} 4\\pi = 4\\pi\n$$\nThe energy concentration at the singularity is $4\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi}$$", "id": "3047451"}]}
