This means that for any Borel set $A \\subseteq X$, the following must hold:\n$$\n\\pi(A \\times X) = (\\operatorname{proj}_{1})_{\\#}\\pi(A) = \\delta_{x}(A)\n$$\nwhere $(\\operatorname{proj}_{1})_{\\#}\\pi$ is the pushforward of $\\pi$ by the projection onto the first coordinate.

The definitions are correct, the premise is sound, and the question is well-posed from a mathematical standpoint. I will proceed with the solution and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks why the classic Bonnet–Myers theorem, which guarantees finiteness of diameter for a Riemannian manifold with a positive lower bound on Ricci curvature, does not straightforwardly extend to the $CD(K,\\infty)$ setting, even for $K>0$. The classical proof and its generalization to $CD(K,N)$ spaces with $N<\\infty$ rely crucially on a dimension-dependent volume comparison result, the Bishop–Gromov theorem. This theorem states that the volume of metric balls in a space with Ricci curvature bounded below by $K$ and dimension $N$ grows no faster than in the $N$-dimensional model space of constant curvature $K$. For $K>0$, this model space is a sphere $S_K^N$, which is compact and has finite volume. The bounded volume growth of any ball in the space $(X,d)$ implies that the space itself must be compact, and hence have a finite diameter.\n\nWhen the dimension parameter $N$ is taken to be $\\infty$, the corresponding Bishop–Gromov volume comparison becomes vacuous or, when formalized, provides a comparison with an infinite-dimensional model space that is not compact. Thus, the crucial step of leveraging volume growth control to deduce compactness is lost. The $CD(K, \\infty)$ condition, which is a statement about the convexity of entropy along $W_2$-geodesics, is too weak by itself to enforce the geometric constraint of compactness.\n\nWe need to find an explicit example of a metric measure space $(X,d,m)$ that has infinite diameter yet satisfies $CD(K,\\infty)$ for some $K>0$. A canonical source of such examples is the Bakry–Émery theory on smooth manifolds. Let's consider the candidate space given in option A: $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},d_{\\mathrm{Eucl}},m)$, where $d_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$ is the standard Euclidean metric and the measure $m$ has density proportional to $e^{-\\frac{K}{2}|x|^{2}}$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure $dx$. The underlying metric space is $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_{\\text{Eucl}})$, whose diameter is manifestly infinite: $\\mathrm{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\sup_{x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} \\|x-y\\| = \\infty$.\n\nNow, we verify if this space satisfies $CD(K,\\infty)$ for $K>0$. We use the Bakry–Émery criterion. The measure is of the form $m=e^{-V}\\mathrm{vol}_{g}$, where $g$ is the Euclidean metric tensor and $\\mathrm{vol}_g = dx$. The potential function is $V(x) = \\frac{K}{2}|x|^2 + C$ for some constant $C$ related to normalization (which we can ignore as it does not affect the Hessian).\nThe Ricci curvature of the Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g)$ is identically zero: $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} = 0$.\nWe need to compute the Hessian of $V(x) = \\frac{K}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_j} = K x_j $$\n$$ (\\nabla^2 V)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = K \\delta_{ij} $$\nIn tensor notation, this means $\\nabla^2 V = K g$.\nThe Bakry–Émery tensor is then:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}_{g} + \\nabla^2 V = 0 + K g = K g $$\nThis satisfies the condition $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} + \\nabla^2 V \\geq K g$ (with equality). Therefore, by the results of Lott, Sturm, and Villani, the metric measure space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},d_{\\mathrm{Eucl}},m)$ with $m$ being the Gaussian measure (up to normalization) satisfies the $CD(K,\\infty)$ condition.\n\nWe have thus constructed an explicit example of a space with $CD(K,\\infty)$ for $K>0$ and infinite diameter. This confirms that the Bonnet–Myers theorem fails for $N=\\infty$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The condition $CD(K,\\infty)$ controls the convexity of entropy but does not impose finite-dimensional volume comparison; therefore it does not force $\\mathrm{diam}(X)$ to be finite. An explicit example is $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},d_{\\mathrm{Eucl}},m)$ with $dm=e^{-\\frac{K}{2}|x|^{2}}dx$ for $K>0$, which satisfies $CD(K,\\infty)$ while $\\mathrm{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})=\\infty$.**\nThis option provides the correct reason for the failure of the diameter bound: the lack of a constraining finite-dimensional volume comparison theorem. It also provides the canonical example of the Gaussian space on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. As shown in the derivation above, this space indeed satisfies $CD(K,\\infty)$ for $K>0$ while its underlying metric space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has infinite diameter. The description is accurate and the example is valid.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $K>0$ and $CD(K,\\infty)$ holds, then measure concentration implies $(X,d)$ is totally bounded, hence $\\mathrm{diam}(X)$ is finite. The Gaussian space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},d_{\\mathrm{Eucl}},\\gamma_{n})$ with $\\gamma_{n}$ the standard Gaussian measure therefore has finite diameter.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While $CD(K,\\infty)$ with $K>0$ does imply strong measure concentration properties (such as the Lévy-Gromov isoperimetric inequality), measure concentration is a property of the measure, not necessarily of its support. It means that most of the measure's mass is contained in a \"small\" set, but it does not imply that the entire space $(X,d)$ is bounded. The Gaussian space is the primary counterexample: the Gaussian measure is highly concentrated around the origin, but the space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is unbounded.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under $CD(K,\\infty)$ with $K>0$, the metric diameter always satisfies $\\mathrm{diam}(X)\\leq \\sqrt{2/K}$, because the $K$-convexity of entropy provides a uniform bound on the maximal transport distance between Dirac masses.**\nThis claim is false. The example discussed in option A, the Gaussian space on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, satisfies $CD(K,\\infty)$ with $K>0$ but has infinite diameter. This directly contradicts the claim that the diameter is always bounded. The purported bound $\\sqrt{2/K}$ and the reasoning provided are spurious. Applying the convexity inequality to Dirac masses is fraught with technical difficulties (infinite initial entropy), and even proper limiting arguments do not yield a diameter bound without a finite dimension assumption.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The only spaces with $CD(K,\\infty)$ and $K>0$ are compact Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature, such as round spheres, so the diameter bound persists; in particular, $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},d_{\\mathrm{Eucl}},\\gamma_{n})$ does not satisfy $CD(K,\\infty)$ for any $K>0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts. First, the class of spaces satisfying $CD(K,\\infty)$ is vast and includes many non-compact spaces and non-Riemannian spaces. The Gaussian space on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a prime example of a non-compact space that satisfies the condition. Second, as a direct consequence, the claim that the Gaussian space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n},d_{\\mathrm{Eucl}},\\gamma_{n})$ does not satisfy $CD(K,\\infty)$ for $K>0$ is false. As shown in our derivation, it satisfies $CD(1,\\infty)$ for the standard Gaussian measure, and $CD(K,\\infty)$ for a suitably scaled version.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3064729"}]}
