This means there exists a fixed point $p \\in N$ such that $f(x) = p$ for all $x \\in M$. We will analyze each of the quantities mentioned in the problem statement under this condition.\n\nFirst, we consider the differential of $f$, denoted $df$. The differential $df$ is a section of the tensor bundle $T^*M \\otimes f^{-1}TN$. At any point $x \\in M$, $(df)_x$ is a linear map from the tangent space $T_xM$ to the tangent space $T_{f(x)}N = T_p N$. For any tangent vector $X \\in T_xM$, the vector $(df)_x(X) \\in T_pN$ is defined as the derivative of the curve $t \\mapsto f(c(t))$ at $t=0$, where $c$ is any smooth curve in $M$ with $c(0)=x$ and $c'(0)=X$. Since $f(c(t)) = p$ for all $t$, the curve $f \\circ c$ is constant. Its derivative is therefore the zero vector in $T_pN$. Thus, we have:\n$$ (df)_x(X) = 0 $$\nfor all $X \\in T_xM$ and for all $x \\in M$. This implies that the differential $df$ is the zero section of the bundle $T^*M \\otimes f^{-1}TN$, which we write as $df \\equiv 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the energy density of $f$, defined as $e(f) = \\frac{1}{2}|df|^2$. The squared norm $|df|^2$ at a point $x \\in M$ is given by $\\operatorname{tr}_g(df^* \\circ df)$, where $df^*$ is the adjoint of $df$. In local coordinates, $|df|^2 = g^{ij}h_{\\alpha\\beta} (df)_i^\\alpha (df)_j^\\beta$. Since $df \\equiv 0$, its components $(df)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial f^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i}$ are all zero. Consequently, its norm is zero at every point:\n$$ |df|^2(x) = 0 \\quad \\forall x \\in M $$\nTherefore, the energy density $e(f)$ is the constant function $0$ on $M$:\n$$ e(f) = \\frac{1}{2} (0) = 0 $$\n\nThe Bochner identity in question has the Laplace-Beltrami operator applied to the energy density, $\\Delta e(f)$, as its left-hand side. The Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ acts on a smooth function $\\phi$ by $\\Delta \\phi = \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{grad} \\phi)$. Since $e(f)$ is the constant function $0$ on $M$, its gradient is the zero vector field, $\\operatorname{grad}(e(f)) = 0$. The divergence of the zero vector field is zero. Hence, the left-hand side of the Bochner identity vanishes identically:\n$$ \\Delta e(f) = \\Delta(0) = 0 $$\n\nNow, we examine the terms on the right-hand side of the identity. The problem states that this side is a linear combination of complete contractions of the tensors $df$, $\\nabla df$, $\\tau(f)$, $R^N$ pulled back via $df$, and $\\operatorname{Ric}^M$ acted upon by $df$. We will show that each of these fundamental building blocks is zero.\n\nWe have already established that $df \\equiv 0$.\n\nLet's consider the covariant derivative of $df$, denoted $\\nabla df$. This is the covariant derivative of the zero tensor field. The covariant derivative of a constant tensor field (in this case, the zero tensor) is zero. To be explicit, the formula for the components of $\\nabla df$ is:\n$$ (\\nabla_k df)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial (df)_i^\\alpha}{\\partial x^k} - \\Gamma_{ki}^j (df)_j^\\alpha + {^N\\Gamma}_{\\beta\\gamma}^\\alpha(f) \\frac{\\partial f^\\beta}{\\partial x^k} (df)_i^\\gamma $$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ and $^N\\Gamma$ are the Christoffel symbols for $(M,g)$ and $(N,h)$ respectively. Since $f$ is constant, $\\frac{\\partial f^\\beta}{\\partial x^k}=0$, which means $(df)_k^\\beta=0$. As $df$ is the zero tensor field, all its components $(df)_i^\\alpha$ are zero, and so are their partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial (df)_i^\\alpha}{\\partial x^k}$. All three terms on the right-hand side of the equation for $(\\nabla_k df)_i^\\alpha$ are zero. Thus, $\\nabla df \\equiv 0$.\n\nNext, we consider the tension field $\\tau(f)$, which is defined as the trace of $\\nabla df$:\n$$ \\tau(f) = \\operatorname{tr}_g(\\nabla df) $$\nIn local coordinates, $\\tau(f)^\\alpha = g^{ij}(\\nabla_i df)_j^\\alpha$. Since we have shown that $\\nabla df \\equiv 0$, all of its components are zero. It follows that its trace must also be zero. Thus, $\\tau(f) \\equiv 0$.\n\nAny summand on the right-hand side of the Bochner identity is a complete contraction of a tensor product involving one or more of the following tensors:\n1.  $df$: Any term that is a multilinear function of $df$ (e.g., a contraction of a tensor product containing $df$ as a factor) must be zero, as we are contracting with a zero tensor.\n2.  $\\nabla df$: Similarly, any term involving $\\nabla df$ as a factor must be zero. A common term in Bochner identities is $|\\nabla df|^2$, which is clearly $0$ since $\\nabla df \\equiv 0$.\n3.  $\\tau(f)$: Any term involving the tension field $\\tau(f)$ as a factor must be zero.\n4.  $R^N$ pulled back via $df$: Terms involving the curvature of the target manifold $N$ are typically of the form $\\langle R^N(df(X), df(Y))df(Z), df(W)\\rangle$. Since $df$ maps every vector to the zero vector, these terms take the form $\\langle R^N(0,0)0,0\\rangle$. By the multilinearity of the Riemann tensor $R^N$, this expression is zero.\n5.  $\\operatorname{Ric}^M$ acted upon by $df$: Terms involving the Ricci curvature of the domain manifold $M$ are typically of the form $\\operatorname{tr}_g(X \\mapsto \\langle df(\\operatorname{Ric}^M(X)), df(Y)\\rangle)$ for some $Y$ also constructed from basis vectors. Since $df \\equiv 0$, the expression inside the trace is always zero. For example, a standard term is $\\langle \\text{Ric}^M, f^*h \\rangle_g$. Since $f^*h$ is identically zero for a constant map, this term vanishes.\n\nSince every one of the fundamental tensors $df$, $\\nabla df$, and $\\tau(f)$ is identically zero for a constant map $f$, any term constructed as a contraction of a tensor product involving any of these tensors must also be zero. The problem statement guarantees that all terms on the right-hand side are of this nature. Therefore, every summand on the right-hand side of the identity is pointwise zero on $M$. The sum of these terms is consequently zero.\n\nIn conclusion, for a constant map $f$, both the left-hand side, $\\Delta e(f)$, and the right-hand side of any standard Bochner identity for harmonic maps are identically zero as functions on $M$. The common value of the two sides at any point of $M$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3025936"}, {"introduction": "After examining the trivial case, the next logical step is to consider a non-trivial map on a simple geometric stage: a linear map between flat Euclidean spaces.

Since we are using standard coordinates, $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$ and $h_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$.

The partial derivative of a constant is zero:\n$$(\\nabla Du)_{ki}^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial (a_{\\alpha i})}{\\partial x^k} = 0$$\nSince all components of the tensor $\\nabla Du$ are zero, the tensor itself is identically zero: $\\nabla Du \\equiv 0$.\n\nThe pointwise squared norm of $\\nabla Du$ is given by $|\\nabla Du|^2 = g^{k_1 k_2} g^{i_1 i_2} h_{\\alpha\\beta} (\\nabla Du)_{k_1 i_1}^\\alpha (\\nabla Du)_{k_2 i_2}^\\beta$. As all components are zero, the norm is necessarily zero:\n$$|\\nabla Du|^2 = 0$$\n\n**3.
