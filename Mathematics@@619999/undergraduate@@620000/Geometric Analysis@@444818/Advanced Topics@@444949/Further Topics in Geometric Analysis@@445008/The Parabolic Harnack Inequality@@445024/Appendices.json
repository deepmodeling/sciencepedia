The function $u$ is a positive classical solution to the heat equation, $u_{t} - \\Delta u = 0$, defined on $\\Omega \\times (t_{1}, t_{2})$, where $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an open set. The sets $Q^{-}$ and $Q^{+}$ are compact space-time sub-cylinders with their time intervals strictly ordered, such that $\\sup\\{t : (x,t) \\in Q^{-}\\}  \\inf\\{t : (x,t) \\in Q^{+}\\}$. The constant $C  0$ must be independent of the particular solution $u$.\n\nLet us perform the test as instructed. Consider a constant positive solution $u(x,t) = k$, where $k$ is a real constant and $k  0$. We first verify that this function is indeed a positive caloric function.\n1.  Positivity: $u(x,t) = k  0$ for all $(x,t)$, so it is a positive function.\n2.  Heat Equation: We compute the partial derivatives. The partial derivative with respect to time is $u_{t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}k = 0$. The partial derivatives with respect to the spatial variables are $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}k = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$. Consequently, the Laplacian is $\\Delta u = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2}k = 0$.\n    Substituting these into the heat equation gives $u_{t} - \\Delta u = 0 - 0 = 0$. The function $u(x,t) = k$ is infinitely differentiable, hence a classical solution.\n\nSince $u(x,t) = k$ is a valid solution for which the inequality must hold for any admissible constant $C$, we substitute it into the inequality.\nThe terms $\\sup_{Q^{-}} u$ and $\\inf_{Q^{+}} u$ are the supremum and infimum of the function $u$ over the compact sets $Q^{-}$ and $Q^{+}$, respectively. Since $u(x,t)$ is constant and equal to $k$ everywhere in its domain, and the compact sets $Q^{-}$ and $Q^{+}$ are non-empty, we have:\n$$\n\\sup_{Q^{-}} u = \\sup_{(x,t) \\in Q^{-}} k = k\n$$\n$$\n\\inf_{Q^{+}} u = \\inf_{(x,t) \\in Q^{+}} k = k\n$$\nSubstituting these values back into the Harnack-type inequality yields:\n$$\nk \\leq C \\cdot k\n$$\nThe problem states that $u$ is a positive solution, so we have chosen $k  0$. We can therefore divide both sides of the inequality by $k$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n1 \\leq C\n$$\nThis result is a necessary condition on the constant $C$. For the inequality to be valid for all positive caloric functions, it must, in particular, hold for the constant ones. This test demonstrates that $C$ cannot be less than $1$. Therefore, the smallest possible value that the constant $C$ can take is $1$.\n\nThe problem also asks to identify the trivial situation in which equality holds. Equality in the inequality $\\sup_{Q^{-}} u \\leq C \\inf_{Q^{+}} u$ is the condition $\\sup_{Q^{-}} u = C \\inf_{Q^{+}} u$.\nFrom our analysis, the smallest possible value for $C$ is $1$. Let's set $C=1$. The condition for equality becomes $\\sup_{Q^{-}} u = \\inf_{Q^{+}} u$.\nThe \"trivial situation\" refers to the simplest case where this occurs. This is precisely the test case we used: a constant positive solution $u(x,t) = k$ with $k  0$. For such a solution, we have $\\sup_{Q^{-}} u = k$ and $\\inf_{Q^{+}} u = k$. With $C=1$, the equality holds: $k = 1 \\cdot k$.\nMore generally, by the strong maximum principle for parabolic equations, if a non-constant solution is considered in a connected domain, one expects a strict inequality $\\sup_{Q^{-}} u  \\inf_{Q^{+}} u$ due to the dissipative nature of heat flow. The condition $\\sup_{Q^{-}} u \\leq \\inf_{Q^{+}} u$ (which is the inequality for $C=1$) would force the solution to be constant. Thus, the only situation where equality can hold with $C=1$ is when the solution $u$ is itself constant. This identifies the constant positive solutions as the trivial case for which equality holds.\n\nBased on the directed test, the smallest admissible value for $C$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3073793"}, {"introduction": "The Parabolic Harnack Inequality connects the values of a solution in different space-time regions, often called parabolic cylinders.

The core of the problem lies in the constraints on the time intervals $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$.\n\nLet us represent the time intervals as $I^{-} = (t_{1}, t_{2}]$ and $I^{+} = (t_{3}, t_{4}]$. The notation $(a,b]$ for the intervals is consistent with the definition of the larger cylinder's time interval $(t_{0} - 4 r^{2}, t_{0}]$.\n\nThe given conditions on these intervals are:\n1.  **Containment**: $I^{-}, I^{+} \\subset (t_{0} - 4 r^{2}, t_{0}]$.\n    For $I^{-} = (t_{1}, t_{2}]$, this means $t_{1} \\ge t_{0} - 4r^{2}$ and $t_{2} \\le t_{0}$.\n    For $I^{+} = (t_{3}, t_{4}]$, this means $t_{3} \\ge t_{0} - 4r^{2}$ and $t_{4} \\le t_{0}$.\n2.  **Length**: The time-lengths (durations) are given as $|I^{-}| = r^{2}$ and $|I^{+}| = r^{2}$.\n    This translates to $t_{2} - t_{1} = r^{2}$ and $t_{4} - t_{3} = r^{2}$.\n3.  **Time Gap**: The gap between the intervals is defined by $\\inf I^{+} - \\sup I^{-} = c \\, r^{2}$.\n    With our notation, this is $t_{3} - t_{2} = c \\, r^{2}$.\n    The problem implies a chronological ordering where $I^{-}$ precedes $I^{+}$, so we expect $t_3  t_2$, which means $c0$.\n\nOur objective is to find the maximal possible value of $c$. From the gap equation, $c = \\frac{t_{3} - t_{2}}{r^{2}}$. To maximize $c$, we must maximize the time difference $t_{3} - t_{2}$.\n\nLet's use the constraints to establish bounds on $t_2$ and $t_3$.\nFrom the length constraint for $I^{+}$, we have $t_{3} = t_{4} - r^{2}$.\nFrom the containment constraint for $I^{+}$, we have $t_{4} \\le t_{0}$.\nCombining these, we get an upper bound for $t_{3}$:\n$$t_{3} = t_{4} - r^{2} \\le t_{0} - r^{2}$$\n\nFrom the length constraint for $I^{-}$, we have $t_{2} = t_{1} + r^{2}$.\nFrom the containment constraint for $I^{-}$, we have $t_{1} \\ge t_{0} - 4r^{2}$.\nCombining these, we get a lower bound for $t_{2}$:\n$$t_{2} = t_{1} + r^{2} \\ge (t_{0} - 4r^{2}) + r^{2} = t_{0} - 3r^{2}$$\n\nNow we can establish an upper bound for the gap $t_{3} - t_{2}$:\n$$t_{3} - t_{2} \\le (t_{0} - r^{2}) - (t_{0} - 3r^{2})$$\n$$t_{3} - t_{2} \\le t_{0} - r^{2} - t_{0} + 3r^{2}$$\n$$t_{3} - t_{2} \\le 2r^{2}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $c$:\n$$c \\, r^{2} \\le 2r^{2}$$\nSince $r  0$, we can divide by $r^{2}$:\n$$c \\le 2$$\nThis shows that the maximal possible value for $c$ is no greater than $2$.\n\nTo confirm that $c=2$ is indeed the maximum, we must show that it is attainable. This requires demonstrating the existence of at least one admissible choice of $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ for which $c=2$.\nThe equality $c=2$ is achieved if the upper bound for the gap is met, i.e., $t_{3} - t_{2} = 2r^{2}$. This occurs if $t_{3}$ attains its maximum possible value and $t_{2}$ attains its minimum possible value.\nLet's set:\n$t_{3} = t_{0} - r^{2}$\n$t_{2} = t_{0} - 3r^{2}$\n\nUsing these values, we can determine the full intervals $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$:\nFor $I^{-}$, we have $\\sup I^{-} = t_{2} = t_{0} - 3r^{2}$. Since $|I^{-}| = r^{2}$, we have $\\inf I^{-} = t_{1} = t_{2} - r^{2} = (t_{0} - 3r^{2}) - r^{2} = t_{0} - 4r^{2}$.\nSo, $I^{-} = (t_{0} - 4r^{2}, t_{0} - 3r^{2}]$.\n\nFor $I^{+}$, we have $\\inf I^{+} = t_{3} = t_{0} - r^{2}$.

Correct.\n    $|I^{+}| = t_{0} - (t_{0} - r^{2}) = r^{2}$. Correct.\n3.  **Time Gap**:\n    $\\inf I^{+} - \\sup I^{-} = (t_{0} - r^{2}) - (t_{0} - 3r^{2}) = 2r^{2}$.\n    This corresponds to $c r^{2} = 2r^{2}$, which gives $c=2$.\n\nThis explicit construction is admissible and yields $c=2$. Since we have already shown that $c \\le 2$, we can conclude that the maximal value of $c$ is $2$.\nThe total time spanned by the two intervals and the gap is $|I^{-}| + (\\text{gap}) + |I^{+}| = r^{2} + 2r^{2} + r^{2} = 4r^{2}$.

We are asked to analyze two specific choices for the coefficient matrix, $A(x,t)$.\n\nFirst, we consider the matrix field $A_{1}(x,t)$ defined as:\n$$\nA_{1}(x,t) := \\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{diag}(1,2),  \\text{if } x_{1} \\ge 0,\\\\\n\\mathrm{diag}(2,1),  \\text{if } x_{1}  0,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nfor all $(x,t) \\in Q$.\nWe verify its properties.\nSymmetry: For any $(x,t) \\in Q$, the matrix $A_{1}(x,t)$ is a diagonal matrix, which is inherently symmetric.\nMeasurability: The value of $A_1(x,t)$ is determined by the sign of the coordinate $x_1$. The sets $\\{(x,t) \\in Q : x_1 \\ge 0\\}$ and $\\{(x,t) \\in Q : x_1  0\\}$ are Borel-measurable subsets of $Q$. Since $A_1(x,t)$ is constant on each of these measurable sets, it is a measurable function.\nDiscontinuity: The matrix field is discontinuous on the hyperplane where $x_{1}=0$. To demonstrate this, consider a point $p=(0, x_2)$ for any $x_2$ such that $(0,x_2) \\in B_2(0)$. The limit of $A_{1}(x,t)$ as $x \\to p$ depends on the direction of approach. If we approach from the half-space $x_1  0$, the limit is $\\mathrm{diag}(1,2)$. If we approach from the half-space $x_1  0$, the limit is $\\mathrm{diag}(2,1)$. Since these limits are not equal, $A_1(x,t)$ is discontinuous at all points $(x,t)$ where $x_1=0$.\nUniform Ellipticity: This property requires the existence of constants $0  \\lambda \\le \\Lambda  \\infty$ such that $\\lambda |\\xi|^{2} \\le \\xi^{\\top} A(x,t) \\,\\xi \\le \\Lambda |\\xi|^{2}$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and all $(x,t) \\in Q$.\nFor a vector $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we examine the quadratic form $\\xi^{\\top} A_1 \\xi$.\nIf $x_1 \\ge 0$, then $A_1 = \\mathrm{diag}(1,2)$, and $\\xi^{\\top} A_1 \\xi = 1\\xi_1^2 + 2\\xi_2^2$. The eigenvalues are $1$ and $2$. Thus, we have $1|\\xi|^2 \\le \\xi^{\\top} A_1 \\xi \\le 2|\\xi|^2$.\nIf $x_1  0$, then $A_1 = \\mathrm{diag}(2,1)$, and $\\xi^{\\top} A_1 \\xi = 2\\xi_1^2 + 1\\xi_2^2$.

Since $0  1 \\le 2  \\infty$, the matrix field $A_1(x,t)$ is uniformly elliptic on $Q$.\nThe ellipticity ratio is $\\Lambda/\\lambda = 2/1 = 2$.\nThe Parabolic Harnack Inequality (PHI) is a cornerstone result of the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory for second-order parabolic equations in divergence form. A fundamental conclusion of this theory is that the PHI holds for non-negative weak solutions provided that the coefficient matrix $A(x,t)$ is merely measurable and uniformly elliptic. The regularity of the coefficients, such as continuity, is not required. Since we have established that $A_1(x,t)$ is both measurable and uniformly elliptic, it satisfies the hypotheses of this foundational theory. Therefore, any non-negative weak solution to $u_{t} - \\nabla \\cdot \\big( A_{1}(x,t) \\nabla u \\big) = 0$ must obey the Parabolic Harnack Inequality.\n\nNext, we consider the matrix field $A_{2}(x,t) := |x_{1}|^{\\alpha} I_{2}$ for a fixed constant $\\alpha  0$.\nWe first explain why $A_2$ is not uniformly elliptic. For uniform ellipticity, we would need $0  \\lambda \\le \\Lambda  \\infty$ such that $\\lambda \\le |x_1|^\\alpha \\le \\Lambda$ for all $x \\in B_2(0)$. While an upper bound $\\Lambda$ exists (e.g., $\\Lambda = 2^\\alpha$, since $|x_1|  2$), a positive lower bound $\\lambda$ does not. The domain of definition for $x$ is $B_2(0)$, which includes points with $x_1$ arbitrarily close to $0$. As $x_1 \\to 0$, we have $|x_1|^\\alpha \\to 0$ because $\\alpha0$. The infimum of $|x_1|^\\alpha$ over $x \\in B_2(0)$ is $0$. It is thus impossible to find a constant $\\lambda  0$ that satisfies $\\lambda \\le |x_1|^\\alpha$ for all $x \\in B_2(0)$. Consequently, $A_2$ is not uniformly elliptic; it is degenerate along the hyperplane $\\{x_1=0\\}$.\nNow we examine the consequences for the PHI. The equation is $u_{t} - \\nabla \\cdot ( |x_{1}|^{\\alpha} \\nabla u ) = 0$. The coefficient $|x_1|^\\alpha$ is the diffusivity. Its vanishing at $x_1=0$ implies that this hyperplane acts as a perfect insulator: the diffusive flux, $-A_2 \\nabla u = -|x_1|^\\alpha \\nabla u$, is identically zero for $x_1=0$, blocking any transport across this interface.\nConsider a non-negative weak solution $u$ with initial data $u(x,-4) = u_0(x)$ where $u_0$ is a non-trivial, non-negative function with support strictly in the half-space $\\{x_1  0\\}$, meaning $u_0(x)=0$ for all $x$ with $x_1 \\le 0$. The function $v(x,t) \\equiv 0$ is a valid solution to the PDE in the domain $\\{x_1  0\\} \\times (-4,0)$ and matches the initial data there. Due to the insulating barrier at $x_1=0$, the evolution in the right half-space $\\{x_1  0\\}$ is completely decoupled from the left. In the right half-space, the equation is non-degenerate and the initial data is non-trivial, so the solution will be positive for $t-4$ in some regions. A valid global weak solution can thus be constructed that remains identically zero for all $t  -4$ in the region $\\{x_1  0\\}$ while being positive in parts of $\\{x_1  0\\}$.\nThis behavior violates the qualitative principle of the PHI. The PHI roughly states that for a non-negative solution, being positive at one point implies being positive at nearby points at later times. More formally, it gives a bound of the form $\\sup_{C_-} u \\le C \\inf_{C_+} u$ for certain space-time cylinders $C_+, C_-$. If we consider any such set of cylinders that straddles the hyperplane $\\{x_1=0\\}$, our constructed solution would yield $\\inf u = 0$ (from the $x_10$ side) while $\\sup u  0$ (from the $x_10$ side). This leads to a contradiction, as it would imply $0  \\sup u \\le C \\cdot 0 = 0$. Hence, the PHI fails for solutions to the equation with the degenerate coefficient matrix $A_2$.\nThe final task is to calculate the ellipticity ratio $\\Lambda/\\lambda$ for the matrix $A_1$.
