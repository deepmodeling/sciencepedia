All necessary information is provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the $2$-Wasserstein distance, $W_2(\\mu, \\nu)$, between two probability measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ on the unit circle $S^1$. The measures are discrete and given by:\n$$\n\\mu \\;=\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\delta_{0} \\;+\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\delta_{\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n\\nu \\;=\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\delta_{\\alpha} \\;+\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\delta_{\\pi + \\alpha}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}$.

The measures are uniformly distributed on their supports, with each point mass having a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe squared $2$-Wasserstein distance is defined as the minimum cost of transporting mass from $\\mu$ to $\\nu$:\n$$\nW_2^2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma(\\mu, \\nu)} \\int_{S^1 \\times S^1} d(x, y)^2 \\, d\\gamma(x, y)\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma(\\mu, \\nu)$ is the set of all couplings of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$, and $d(x, y)$ is the geodesic distance on $S^1$.\n\nSince the measures are discrete, a coupling $\\gamma$ is a joint probability distribution on $X \\times Y$. It can be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P = (p_{ij})$, where $p_{ij}$ is the amount of mass transported from $x_i$ to $y_j$. The constraints on $P$ are that its row sums match the weights of $\\mu$ and its column sums match the weights of $\\nu$.\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^2 p_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ for } i=1,2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^2 p_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ for } j=1,2\n$$\nwith $p_{ij} \\ge 0$.

The geodesic distance is $d(\\theta, \\varphi) = \\min(|\\theta - \\varphi|, 2\\pi - |\\theta - \\varphi|)$.

This corresponds to the coupling matrix\n$$\nP_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe total squared cost for this plan is:\n$$\nC(P_1) = \\frac{1}{2} d(0, \\alpha)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} d(\\pi, \\pi+\\alpha)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha^2 = \\alpha^2.\n$$\n\nPlan $2$: The mass at $0$ is transported to $\\pi+\\alpha$, and the mass at $\\pi$ is transported to $\\alpha$. This corresponds to the \"cross\" mapping, with coupling matrix\n$$\nP_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe total squared cost for this plan is:\n$$\nC(P_2) = \\frac{1}{2} d(0, \\pi+\\alpha)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} d(\\pi, \\alpha)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (\\pi-\\alpha)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\pi-\\alpha)^2 = (\\pi-\\alpha)^2.\n$$\nAny other valid transport plan would be a convex combination of these two permutations and would result in a cost that is a convex combination of their costs. Therefore, the minimum cost must be one of these two.\n\nThe squared Wasserstein distance is the minimum of these two costs:\n$$\nW_2^2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min(C(P_1), C(P_2)) = \\min(\\alpha^2, (\\pi-\\alpha)^2)\n$$\nTaking the square root, and noting that $\\alpha \\in [0, \\pi]$ implies both $\\alpha$ and $\\pi-\\alpha$ are non-negative, we get:\n$$\nW_2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\sqrt{\\min(\\alpha^2, (\\pi-\\alpha)^2)} = \\min(\\alpha, \\pi-\\alpha)\n$$\nWe are given $\\alpha = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}$. Substituting this value into the formula:\n$$\nW_2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{5}, \\pi - \\frac{3\\pi}{5}\\right) = \\min\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{5}, \\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\frac{2}{5} < \\frac{3}{5}$, the minimum is $\\frac{2\\pi}{5}$.\n$$\nW_2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\frac{2\\pi}{5}\n$$\n\nAs a consistency check, we examine the behavior of the derived formula.\n$1$. When $\\alpha = 0$, the measures are identical: $\\mu = \\nu$. Our formula yields $W_2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min(0, \\pi-0) = 0$. This correctly reflects the identity of indiscernibles property of a metric, $d(x,x) = 0$.\n\n$2$. To check for invariance under replacing $\\alpha$ by $-\\alpha$, we consider the measure $\\nu' = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{-\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{\\pi-\\alpha}$. The Wasserstein distance is invariant under isometries of the underlying space. Let $R_\\theta$ denote a rotation by angle $\\theta$. Then $\\nu = (R_\\alpha)_\\# \\mu$ and $\\nu' = (R_{-\\alpha})_\\# \\mu$. The distance $W_2(\\mu, \\nu)$ is invariant if we apply an isometry to both measures. Applying the rotation $R_{-\\alpha}$:\n$$\nW_2(\\mu, \\nu) = W_2((R_{-\\alpha})_\\# \\mu, (R_{-\\alpha})_\\# \\nu) = W_2(\\nu', (R_{-\\alpha} \\circ R_\\alpha)_\\# \\mu) = W_2(\\nu', \\mu)\n$$\nBy symmetry of the metric, $W_2(\\nu', \\mu) = W_2(\\mu, \\nu')$. Thus, the distance is the same for $\\alpha$ and $-\\alpha$. Our general result for $\\alpha \\in [0, \\pi]$, $W_2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min(\\alpha, \\pi-\\alpha)$, can be extended to any $\\alpha$ by first taking its value modulo $2\\pi$ into $(-\\pi, \\pi]$ and then using $W_2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min(|\\alpha|, \\pi - |\\alpha|)$. This generalized formula is an even function of $\\alpha$, showing the invariance. For $\\alpha = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}$ and $-\\alpha = -\\frac{3\\pi}{5} \\equiv \\frac{7\\pi}{5} \\pmod{2\\pi}$, the calculation yields the same result.\n\nThe final result is an exact value in radians as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{5}}$$", "id": "3058016"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the definition of distance, we now move to the calculus on the space of probability measures, a concept central to the modern geometric view of optimal transport.
