The general solution for this system of equations is $\\theta_{2} = \\theta_{1} + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\nGiven that $\\theta_{1} \\in (-\\pi, 0)$, we have $\\theta_{1} + 2k\\pi \\in (-\\pi+2k\\pi, 2k\\pi)$.

Thus, for all $p \\in U_{1} \\cap U_{2}$, $g_{12}(p) = 1$. This is a constant function, taking a value in $\\mathrm{GL}(1,\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{\\times}$.\n\nThe problem also asks to conclude that $TS^{1}$ is trivial. A vector bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global, nowhere-vanishing section. We have two local sections, $e_{1}$ on $U_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ on $U_{2}$. Since $e_{1}(p) = e_{2}(p)$ for all $p$ in the overlap $U_{1} \\cap U_{2}$, we can \"glue\" these sections together to form a well-defined global section $e: S^{1} \\to TS^{1}$ by setting $e(p) = e_{1}(p)$ if $p \\in U_{1}$ and $e(p) = e_{2}(p)$ if $p \\in U_{2}$. This global section is nowhere-vanishing because $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ are nowhere-vanishing on their domains. The existence of such a global frame proves that the tangent bundle $TS^{1}$ is trivial, i.e., diffeomorphic to the cylinder $S^{1} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe constant value of the transition function $g_{12}$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3077892"}, {"introduction": "To perform calculus on vector bundles, we need a way to differentiate sections, which is the role of a connection.
