This integer is a topological invariant, the first Chern number of the associated complex line bundle.\n\n### Step 1: Construct the Local Sections\nLet a point on $S^2$ be $p=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. From the problem definition, we can relate these to the fiber coordinates $(z_0, z_1)$ by $|z_0|^2 = (1+x_3)/2$ and $|z_1|^2 = (1-x_3)/2$.\n- **Section $s_N: U_N \\to S^3$:** The domain $U_N$ excludes the North Pole, so the non-excluded pole is the South Pole $(0,0,-1)$. At this pole, $x_3=-1$, which implies $z_0=0$ and $|z_1|=1$. The condition is that the component corresponding to the non-excluded pole (here, the one that is non-zero, $z_1$) is real and positive. Thus, we choose $z_1 = \\sqrt{(1-x_3)/2}$. From $2z_0\\overline{z_1} = x_1+ix_2$, we find $z_0 = (x_1+ix_2) / \\sqrt{2(1-x_3)}$. This gives the section $s_N(p) = \\left(\\frac{x_1+ix_2}{\\sqrt{2(1-x_3)}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1-x_3}{2}}\\right)$.\n- **Section $s_S: U_S \\to S^3$:** The domain $U_S$ excludes the South Pole. The non-excluded pole is the North Pole $(0,0,1)$, where $x_3=1$, $z_1=0$, and $|z_0|=1$. We set the $z_0$ component to be real and positive: $z_0 = \\sqrt{(1+x_3)/2}$. From $2\\overline{z_0}z_1 = x_1-ix_2$, we find $z_1 = (x_1-ix_2) / \\sqrt{2(1+x_3)}$. This gives the section $s_S(p) = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x_3}{2}}, \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{\\sqrt{2(1+x_3)}}\\right)$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Transition Function $g_{NS}$\nThe problem defines the transition function $g_{NS}$ via the relation $s_S(p) = s_N(p) \\cdot g_{NS}(p)$. Given the right action $(z_0, z_1)\\cdot\\lambda = (z_0\\lambda, z_1\\lambda)$, this becomes $(z_0^S, z_1^S) = (z_0^N g_{NS}, z_1^N g_{NS})$.\nWe can solve for $g_{NS}$ using either component. Using the second component:\n$$\nz_1^S = z_1^N \\cdot g_{NS} \\implies g_{NS}(p) = \\frac{z_1^S}{z_1^N}\n$$\n$$\ng_{NS}(p) = \\frac{(x_1-ix_2) / \\sqrt{2(1+x_3)}}{\\sqrt{(1-x_3)/2}} = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{\\sqrt{(1+x_3)(1-x_3)}} = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{\\sqrt{1-x_3^2}}\n$$\nSince $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1$ on $S^2$, we have $\\sqrt{1-x_3^2} = \\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} = |x_1+ix_2|$.\n$$\ng_{NS}(p) = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{|x_1+ix_2|}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Express $g_{NS}$ on the Equator\nWe need to relate the parameter $\\theta$ from $v(\\theta)=\\exp(i\\theta)$ to the Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. The standard stereographic projection from the South Pole gives the coordinate $v$ on $U_S$ as $v = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{1+x_3}$.\nThe equator of $S^2$ is the set of points where $x_3=0$. On the equator, the coordinate relation simplifies to $v=x_1-ix_2$.\nThe problem parameterizes the equator by $v(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta)$. Therefore, for a point on the equator parameterized by $\\theta$, we have $x_1-ix_2 = \\exp(i\\theta)$.\nAlso on the equator, $|x_1+ix_2| = \\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}=1$.\nSubstituting these into our expression for the transition function:\n$$\ng_{NS}(\\theta) = \\frac{x_1-ix_2}{|x_1+ix_2|} = \\frac{\\exp(i\\theta)}{1} = \\exp(i\\theta)\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Winding Number\nThe winding number is given by the integral formula:\n$$\n\\deg(g_{NS})=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} g_{NS}(\\theta)^{-1}\\,\\frac{d}{d\\theta}g_{NS}(\\theta)\\,d\\theta\n$$\nWe have $g_{NS}(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta)$.\nIts inverse is $g_{NS}(\\theta)^{-1} = \\exp(-i\\theta)$.\nIts derivative is $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}g_{NS}(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\exp(i\\theta) = i\\exp(i\\theta)$.\nThe term in the integral is:\n$$\ng_{NS}(\\theta)^{-1}\\,\\frac{d}{d\\theta}g_{NS}(\\theta) = \\exp(-i\\theta) \\cdot (i\\exp(i\\theta)) = i\n$$\nNow we compute the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i\\,d\\theta = i[\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = i(2\\pi - 0) = 2\\pi i\n$$\nFinally, the winding number is:\n$$\n\\deg(g_{NS}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} (2\\pi i) = 1\n$$\nThe winding number is $1$.

We shall address each part in sequence, starting from fundamental definitions.\n\nFirst, we determine the curvature $2$-form $F$. The general formula for the curvature $\\mathcal{F}$ of a connection $\\mathcal{A}$ on a principal bundle with Lie group $G$ is given by the Cartan structure equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = d\\mathcal{A} + \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}]\n$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{A}$ is a $1$-form on the base manifold taking values in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$.

Its Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$, which consists of $1 \\times 1$ skew-hermitian matrices. These are simply imaginary numbers, so $\\mathfrak{u}(1) = \\{i\\lambda \\mid \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} \\cong i\\mathbb{R}$. The Lie bracket in $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$ is the commutator of matrices.

Thus, $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$ is an abelian Lie algebra.\nBecause the Lie algebra is abelian, the Lie bracket term in the curvature formula vanishes: $[\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}] = 0$. The curvature formula therefore simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = d\\mathcal{A}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$-valued connection form $\\mathcal{A}$ is represented by a real-valued $1$-form $A$ via the identification $\\mathfrak{u}(1) \\leftrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ where an element $i\\lambda \\in \\mathfrak{u}(1)$ corresponds to $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.
