It is a standard exercise in introductory differential geometry, requiring the application of fundamental definitions of tangent vectors, cotangent vectors, and their contraction. All necessary information is provided to find a unique solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts, as requested.\n\n1.  Construction of the coordinate basis for $T_{p}M$:\nLet $M$ be a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold. A tangent vector $v_{p}$ at a point $p \\in M$ is defined as a derivation on the algebra of germs of smooth functions $C^{\\infty}(p)$. That is, $v_p: C^{\\infty}(p) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a linear map satisfying the Leibniz rule: $v_p(fg) = f(p)v_p(g) + g(p)v_p(f)$ for any $f, g \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$.\nGiven a local chart $(U, x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ around $p$, the coordinate basis vectors $\\{\\partial_i\\vert_{p}\\}_{i=1}^n$ for the tangent space $T_pM$ are defined by their action on a smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$. Let the coordinate representation of $f$ be $\\hat{f} = f \\circ x^{-1}$, such that $f(q) = \\hat{f}(x^1(q), \\dots, x^n(q))$ for $q \\in U$. The action of $\\partial_i\\vert_{p}$ on $f$ is the partial derivative of $\\hat{f}$ with respect to the $i$-th coordinate, evaluated at the coordinates of $p$:\n$$ \\partial_i\\vert_{p}(f) := \\frac{\\partial \\hat{f}}{\\partial u^i}\\bigg|_{x(p)} $$\nwhere $(u^1, \\dots, u^n)$ are the standard coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nIn this problem, $M$ is $2$-dimensional, so $n=2$, and the point $p$ has coordinates $(x^1(p), x^2(p)) = (1, -1)$. The coordinate basis vectors are $\\{\\partial_1\\vert_{p}, \\partial_2\\vert_{p}\\}$, and their action on any $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\partial_1\\vert_{p}(f) = \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ (x^1, x^2)^{-1})}{\\partial u^1}\\bigg|_{(1,-1)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\partial_2\\vert_{p}(f) = \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ (x^1, x^2)^{-1})}{\\partial u^2}\\bigg|_{(1,-1)} $$\nIt is a standard and convenient abuse of notation to write this as $\\partial_i\\vert_{p}(f) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i}\\vert_{p}$.\n\n2.  Construction of the dual basis for $T_{p}^{*}M$:\nThe cotangent space $T_p^*M$ is the dual space of $T_pM$. Its elements are linear functionals on $T_pM$, called covectors or $1$-forms at $p$. The basis $\\{dx^1\\vert_{p}, dx^2\\vert_{p}\\}$ for $T_p^*M$ is the dual basis to $\\{\\partial_1\\vert_{p}, \\partial_2\\vert_{p}\\}$. It is uniquely defined by the duality relation:\n$$ dx^i\\vert_p(\\partial_j\\vert_p) = \\delta^i_j $$\nwhere $\\delta^i_j$ is the Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ if $i \\neq j$. For the $2$-dimensional case at hand, this relation is explicitly:\n$$ dx^1\\vert_p(\\partial_1\\vert_p) = 1, \\quad dx^1\\vert_p(\\partial_2\\vert_p) = 0 $$\n$$ dx^2\\vert_p(\\partial_1\\vert_p) = 0, \\quad dx^2\\vert_p(\\partial_2\\vert_p) = 1 $$\nThis basis is constructed from the coordinate functions $x^i: U \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The covector $dx^i\\vert_p$ is the differential of the function $x^i$ at $p$. Its action on any tangent vector $v_p \\in T_pM$ is defined as $dx^i\\vert_p(v_p) := v_p(x^i)$. Applying a basis vector $\\partial_j\\vert_p$ to the function $x^i$ and using the definition from part $1$ recovers the duality relation: $\\partial_j\\vert_p(x^i) = \\frac{\\partial x^i}{\\partial x^j}\\vert_p = \\delta^i_j$.\n\n3.  Computation of the scalar contraction $\\alpha_p(X_p)$:\nThe scalar contraction $\\alpha_p(X_p)$ is the result of applying the linear functional $\\alpha_p \\in T_p^*M$ to the vector $X_p \\in T_pM$. We proceed by first evaluating the components of the vector field $X$ and covector field $\\alpha$ at the point $p$, where $(x^1, x^2)=(1,-1)$.\n\nThe components of the vector field $X$ are $X^1(x) = (x^1)^2 + x^2$ and $X^2(x) = \\exp(x^1) - x^2$. At $p$:\n$$ X^1(p) = (1)^2 + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ X^2(p) = \\exp(1) - (-1) = e + 1 $$\nSo, the tangent vector at $p$ is:\n$$ X_p = X^1(p)\\,\\partial_1\\vert_p + X^2(p)\\,\\partial_2\\vert_p = 0 \\cdot \\partial_1\\vert_p + (e+1)\\,\\partial_2\\vert_p = (e+1)\\,\\partial_2\\vert_p $$\n\nThe components of the covector field $\\alpha$ are $\\alpha_1(x) = \\sin(x^1x^2)$ and $\\alpha_2(x) = (x^1)^3$. At $p$:\n$$ \\alpha_1(p) = \\sin(1 \\cdot (-1)) = \\sin(-1) = -\\sin(1) $$\n$$ \\alpha_2(p) = (1)^3 = 1 $$\nSo, the covector at $p$ is:\n$$ \\alpha_p = \\alpha_1(p)\\,dx^1\\vert_p + \\alpha_2(p)\\,dx^2\\vert_p = -\\sin(1)\\,dx^1\\vert_p + 1 \\cdot dx^2\\vert_p $$\n\nNow, we compute the contraction $\\alpha_p(X_p)$. This operation is fundamentally a bilinear pairing between $T_p^*M$ and $T_pM$, and its existence and uniqueness for arbitrary tensors is what the universal property of the tensor product formalizes. The calculation proceeds by linearity:\n$$ \\alpha_p(X_p) = \\left( -\\sin(1)\\,dx^1\\vert_p + dx^2\\vert_p \\right) \\left( (e+1)\\,\\partial_2\\vert_p \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_p(X_p) = (e+1) \\left( -\\sin(1)\\,dx^1\\vert_p(\\partial_2\\vert_p) + dx^2\\vert_p(\\partial_2\\vert_p) \\right) $$\nUsing the duality relation $dx^i\\vert_p(\\partial_j\\vert_p) = \\delta^i_j$ from part $2$, we have $dx^1\\vert_p(\\partial_2\\vert_p) = 0$ and $dx^2\\vert_p(\\partial_2\\vert_p) = 1$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\alpha_p(X_p) = (e+1) \\left( -\\sin(1) \\cdot 0 + 1 \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_p(X_p) = (e+1)(0 + 1) = e+1 $$\nAlternatively, the contraction is given in coordinates by the sum of products of corresponding components: $\\alpha_p(X_p) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i(p)X^i(p)$.\n$$ \\alpha_p(X_p) = \\alpha_1(p)X^1(p) + \\alpha_2(p)X^2(p) = (-\\sin(1))(0) + (1)(e+1) = e+1 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{e+1}\n$$", "id": "3065298"}, {"introduction": "While coordinate bases are a natural starting point, much of the power of tensor analysis lies in its independence from any specific choice of coordinates.

The components of $S$, denoted $S^{j}{}_{l}$, are obtained by setting the indices $i$ and $k$ to be equal and summing over their range, according to the Einstein summation convention. Let us use a summation index, say $m$, for this purpose.\n\nThe components of $S$ are thus given by:\n$$S^{j}{}_{l}(x) = T^{mj}{}_{ml}(x)$$\nWe substitute the given expression for the components of $T$:\n$$S^{j}{}_{l}(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^{3} \\left( x^{m}\\,\\delta^{j}_{m}\\,\\delta^{1}_{l} \\;+\\; 2\\,x^{j}\\,\\delta^{m}_{l}\\,\\delta^{2}_{m} \\;+\\; 3\\,\\delta^{m}_{m}\\,\\delta^{j}_{l} \\right)$$\nWe can simplify this expression by evaluating the sum for each term separately.\n\nFor the first term, $\\sum_{m=1}^{3} x^{m}\\,\\delta^{j}_{m}\\,\\delta^{1}_{l}$:\nThe property of the Kronecker delta $\\delta^{j}_{m}$ is that it is non-zero (equal to $1$) only when $m=j$.
