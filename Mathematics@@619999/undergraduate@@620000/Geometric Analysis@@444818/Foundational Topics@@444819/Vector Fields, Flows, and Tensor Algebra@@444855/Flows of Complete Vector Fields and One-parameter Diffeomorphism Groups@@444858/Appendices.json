By definition, the flow is a family of maps $\\Phi_{t}$ such that for any initial point $x_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the curve $\\gamma(t) = \\Phi_{t}(x_{0})$ is the unique solution to the initial value problem:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t) = X(\\gamma(t)), \\quad \\gamma(0) = x_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the vector field $X$, we obtain the following system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t) = A\\gamma(t), \\quad \\gamma(0) = x_{0}\n$$\nThe formal solution to this system is given by the matrix exponential. We define the matrix exponential of an $n \\times n$ matrix $M$ by the power series:\n$$\n\\exp(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!}M^k = I + M + \\frac{1}{2!}M^2 + \\frac{1}{3!}M^3 + \\dots\n$$\nThis series converges absolutely for any matrix $M \\in \\mathfrak{gl}(n,\\mathbb{R})$, defining a smooth map $\\exp: \\mathfrak{gl}(n,\\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nWe propose the solution $\\gamma(t) = \\exp(tA)x_{0}$. We must verify that this function satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.\n\nFirst, we verify the initial condition at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\gamma(0) = \\exp(0 \\cdot A)x_{0} = \\exp(O)x_{0}\n$$\nwhere $O$ is the zero matrix. From the series definition, $\\exp(O) = I + O + \\frac{1}{2!}O^2 + \\dots = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Thus,\n$$\n\\gamma(0) = I x_{0} = x_{0}\n$$\nThe initial condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, we verify the differential equation by differentiating $\\gamma(t)$ with respect to $t$. Using the series definition of $\\exp(tA)$:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(tA)^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\nSince the series converges absolutely and uniformly on any compact interval of $t$, we can differentiate term-by-term:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\n$$\n= \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0} = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k t^{k-1} A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\nThe $k=0$ term is a constant matrix $I$, so its derivative is the zero matrix. Simplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t) = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{k-1} A^k}{(k-1)!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\nWe can factor out one matrix $A$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t) = A \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{k-1} A^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\nLet $j=k-1$. The sum becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t) = A \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{j} A^{j}}{j!} \\right) x_{0} = A (\\exp(tA)) x_{0} = A \\gamma(t)\n$$\nThis confirms that $\\gamma(t) = \\exp(tA)x_{0}$ is a solution to the ODE.\n\nBy the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, since the vector field $X(x) = Ax$ is globally Lipschitz continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (as $\\|X(x) - X(y)\\| = \\|A(x-y)\\| \\le \\|A\\|\\|x-y\\|$), the initial value problem has a unique solution defined on some interval containing $t=0$. Our solution $\\gamma(t) = \\exp(tA)x_0$ is defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ because the matrix exponential series always converges. Therefore, the solution is global, and the flow is complete. The unique flow is given by $\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}) = \\exp(tA)x_{0}$.\n\nNow we show that the family of maps $\\{\\Phi_{t}\\}_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}}$ forms a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms.\n1.  **Group Property**: We must show $\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s} = \\Phi_{t+s}$ for all $s, t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    For any $x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n    $$\n    (\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s})(x_{0}) = \\Phi_{t}(\\Phi_{s}(x_{0})) = \\Phi_{t}(\\exp(sA)x_{0}) = \\exp(tA)(\\exp(sA)x_{0})\n    $$\n    A fundamental property of the matrix exponential is that if two matrices $M$ and $N$ commute (i.e., $MN=NM$), then $\\exp(M)\\exp(N) = \\exp(M+N)$. In our case, $M=tA$ and $N=sA$ commute, since $(tA)(sA) = tsA^2 = (sA)(tA)$. Thus,\n    $$\n    \\exp(tA)\\exp(sA) = \\exp(tA+sA) = \\exp((t+s)A)\n    $$\n    Therefore,\n    $$\n    (\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s})(x_{0}) = \\exp((t+s)A)x_{0} = \\Phi_{t+s}(x_{0})\n    $$\n    This holds for all $x_0$, so $\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s} = \\Phi_{t+s}$.\n\n2.  **Identity Element**: For $t=0$, we have $\\Phi_{0}(x_{0}) = \\exp(0 \\cdot A)x_{0} = I x_{0} = x_{0}$. Thus, $\\Phi_{0}$ is the identity map on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n3.  **Inverse Element**: From the group property, $\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{-t} = \\Phi_{t-t} = \\Phi_{0} = \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$. This means $\\Phi_{t}^{-1} = \\Phi_{-t}$.\n\n4.  **Diffeomorphism Property**: For each $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the map $\\Phi_{t}(x) = \\exp(tA)x$ is a linear transformation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. As a linear map, it is infinitely differentiable (smooth). Its inverse is $\\Phi_{-t}(x) = \\exp(-tA)x$, which is also a linear map and hence smooth. A smooth map with a smooth inverse is a diffeomorphism. Thus, each $\\Phi_{t}$ is a diffeomorphism of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ onto itself.\n\nFinally, we connect this flow to the one-parameter subgroup of $G = \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ generated by $A$. Let $g(t) = \\exp(tA)$. The properties of the matrix exponential imply that $g(t)$ is a one-parameter subgroup of $G$:\n- $g(t)g(s) = \\exp(tA)\\exp(sA) = \\exp((t+s)A) = g(t+s)$\n- $g(0) = \\exp(0) = I$\n- $g(t)^{-1} = \\exp(-tA) = g(-t)$\nFor $g(t)$ to be in $\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$, it must be invertible. We know $\\det(\\exp(M)) = \\exp(\\mathrm{tr}(M))$. Thus, $\\det(g(t)) = \\det(\\exp(tA)) = \\exp(\\mathrm{tr}(tA)) = \\exp(t \\cdot \\mathrm{tr}(A))$. Since the exponential function never yields zero, $\\det(g(t)) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, confirming that $g(t) \\in \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe flow $\\Phi_{t}$ is precisely the action of this one-parameter subgroup on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}) = \\exp(tA)x_{0} = g(t) \\cdot x_{0}\n$$\nThis demonstrates the fundamental correspondence where an element of the Lie algebra $A \\in \\mathfrak{gl}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ generates a one-parameter subgroup $\\exp(tA) \\subset \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$, and this subgroup's action on the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the flow generated by the vector field $X(x)=Ax$.\n\nThe final expression for the flow acting on an initial point $x_0$ is therefore $\\Phi_{t}(x_0) = \\exp(tA)x_{0}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(tA)x_{0}}\n$$", "id": "3048717"}, {"introduction": "While linear vector fields generate well-behaved global flows, this is not always the case for nonlinear fields.

An integral curve is defined by the first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = X(\\gamma(t))$ with the initial condition $\\gamma(0) = p$.\n\nLet us write the ODE explicitly. If we denote $\\gamma(t)$ by $y(t)$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. Since the initial condition is $p \\neq 0$, the solution $y(t)$ will be non-zero for $t$ in some neighborhood of $0$. We can therefore divide by $y^2$ and separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{y^2} = dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of this equation.
