The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet the integral curve be denoted by $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. Its velocity vector, or tangent vector, is given by its derivative with respect to the parameter $t$, which is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}, \\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)$.\n\nThe vector field is given as $X(x,y) = (1,x)$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the System of ODEs**\nThe definition of an integral curve is that its velocity vector at any point along the curve is equal to the vector field evaluated at that same point. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = X(\\gamma(t))\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\gamma(t)$, $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, and $X(x,y)$, we get:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}, \\frac{dy}{dt}\\right) = X(x(t), y(t))\n$$\nThe vector field evaluated at the point $(x(t), y(t))$ on the curve is:\n$$\nX(x(t), y(t)) = (1, x(t))\n$$\nEquating the components of the vectors on both sides of the equation yields the following system of first-order ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = x(t)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is the system of ODEs satisfied by any integral curve of the vector field $X$.\n\n**2. Solution for the Specific Initial Condition**\nWe are asked to find the unique integral curve that passes through the origin at $t=0$. The initial condition is $\\gamma(0) = (0,0)$, which translates to $x(0) = 0$ and $y(0) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we solve the equation for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$\nx(t) = \\int 1 \\, dt = t + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. We use the initial condition $x(0) = 0$ to determine $C_1$:\n$$\nx(0) = 0 + C_1 \\implies 0 = C_1\n$$\nThus, the solution for $x(t)$ is:\n$$\nx(t) = t\n$$\nNext, we substitute this result into the second ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = x(t) = t\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$\ny(t) = \\int t \\, dt = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is another constant of integration. We use the initial condition $y(0) = 0$ to determine $C_2$:\n$$\ny(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 + C_2 \\implies 0 = C_2\n$$\nThus, the solution for $y(t)$ is:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2\n$$\nThe unique integral curve passing through the origin is therefore given by the parametric equation:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\left(t, \\frac{1}{2}t^2\\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Planar Equation and Qualitative Behavior**\nTo find the equation of the curve in the $xy$-plane, we eliminate the parameter $t$. From our specific solution, we have $x = t$ and $y = \\frac{1}{2}t^2$. Substituting $t=x$ into the equation for $y$ gives:\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2}x^2\n$$\nThis is the equation of a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nTo describe the family of all integral curves, we consider the general solution without specific initial conditions.\nFrom $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1$, we have $x(t) = t + C_1$.\nSubstituting this into $\\frac{dy}{dt} = x(t)$, we get $\\frac{dy}{dt} = t + C_1$.\nIntegrating gives $y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + C_1 t + C_2$.\n\nTo eliminate $t$ from the general solution, we first express $t$ in terms of $x$ and $C_1$: $t = x - C_1$.\nThen we substitute this into the expression for $y(t)$:\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2}(x - C_1)^2 + C_1(x - C_1) + C_2\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 2xC_1 + C_1^2) + C_1 x - C_1^2 + C_2\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - xC_1 + \\frac{1}{2}C_1^2 + C_1 x - C_1^2 + C_2\n$$\nSimplifying by combining terms:\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}C_1^2 + C_2\n$$\nLet's define a new constant $C = C_2 - \\frac{1}{2}C_1^2$. The constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by an arbitrary initial condition $(x_0, y_0)$ at $t=0$, so $C$ is uniquely determined by this initial point. The family of integral curves is thus described by the planar equation:\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C\n$$\nQualitatively, this equation represents a family of parabolas. All curves have the same shape, given by $y \\propto x^2$, and orientation (opening upwards). They are vertical translations of one another. The constant $C$ corresponds to the $y$-intercept of each parabola, which determines its vertical position in the plane. For any given point $(x_0, y_0)$ in the plane, a unique integral curve passes through it, corresponding to the specific constant $C = y_0 - \\frac{1}{2}x_0^2$. The vector field $X=(1,x)$ indicates that the flow is always to the right (since the $x$-component is $1$), and the vertical motion depends on the $x$-coordinate: for $x0$ the flow is upwards, for $x0$ it is downwards, and for $x=0$ it is purely horizontal.

This can be rewritten as $\\ln(|x|/|y|) = C$, or $|x|/|y| = \\exp(C) = C'$. Thus, any function that is constant along the characteristic curves must be a function of $y/x$.
