The distribution $D$ is a subbundle of the tangent bundle $T\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, defined pointwise for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ as the span of the first two coordinate vector fields evaluated at $p$:\n$$D_{p} = \\operatorname{span}\\{\\partial_{x}|_{p}, \\partial_{y}|_{p}\\}$$\nThis is a constant rank-$2$ distribution. Let the spanning vector fields be $X = \\partial_{x}$ and $Y = \\partial_{y}$. A general vector field $V$ belonging to the distribution $D$ (denoted $V \\in \\Gamma(D)$) can be written as a linear combination $V = a(x,y,z)X + b(x,y,z)Y$ for some smooth functions $a,b: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nAccording to the Frobenius theorem of integrability, a smooth distribution $D$ is integrable if and only if it is involutive. A distribution is involutive if, for any two vector fields $X_{1}, X_{2} \\in \\Gamma(D)$, their Lie bracket $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ is also a section of $D$, i.e., $[X_{1}, X_{2}] \\in \\Gamma(D)$. To verify involutivity for a distribution spanned by a set of vector fields, it is sufficient to check that the Lie bracket of any pair of spanning vector fields lies within the distribution.\n\nIn our case, the distribution $D$ is spanned by $X = \\partial_{x}$ and $Y = \\partial_{y}$. We must compute their Lie bracket, $[X,Y] = [\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}]$. The Lie bracket of two vector fields $V = \\sum_{i} V^{i}\\partial_{i}$ and $W = \\sum_{j} W^{j}\\partial_{j}$ is given by the formula:\n$$[V, W] = \\sum_{k} \\left( \\sum_{i} V^{i} \\frac{\\partial W^{k}}{\\partial x^{i}} - W^{i} \\frac{\\partial V^{k}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\right) \\partial_{k}$$\nHere, $X = \\partial_{x}$ has components $X^{x}=1$, $X^{y}=0$, $X^{z}=0$. The vector field $Y = \\partial_{y}$ has components $Y^{x}=0$, $Y^{y}=1$, $Y^{z}=0$. All these component functions are constants. The partial derivatives of constants are zero. Therefore, all terms in the formula for the Lie bracket will be zero.\n\nLet's compute the components of $Z = [\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}]$:\n$$Z^{x} = \\left( X^{x}\\frac{\\partial Y^{x}}{\\partial x} + X^{y}\\frac{\\partial Y^{x}}{\\partial y} + X^{z}\\frac{\\partial Y^{x}}{\\partial z} \\right) - \\left( Y^{x}\\frac{\\partial X^{x}}{\\partial x} + Y^{y}\\frac{\\partial X^{x}}{\\partial y} + Y^{z}\\frac{\\partial X^{x}}{\\partial z} \\right)$$\n$$Z^{x} = \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial x} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial y} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial z} \\right) - \\left( 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial x} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial y} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial z} \\right) = (0) - (0) = 0$$\nSimilarly, for the other components:\n$$Z^{y} = \\left( X^{x}\\frac{\\partial Y^{y}}{\\partial x} + \\dots \\right) - \\left( Y^{x}\\frac{\\partial X^{y}}{\\partial x} + \\dots \\right) = \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial x} \\right) - \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial y} \\right) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n$$Z^{z} = \\left( X^{x}\\frac{\\partial Y^{z}}{\\partial x} + \\dots \\right) - \\left( Y^{x}\\frac{\\partial X^{z}}{\\partial x} + \\dots \\right) = \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial x} \\right) - \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial y} \\right) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nThus, we find that $[\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}] = 0$. The zero vector field is trivially a member of any vector space, so for each $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, $[\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}]|_{p} = 0 \\in D_{p}$. This confirms that the distribution $D$ is involutive.\n\nBy the Frobenius theorem, $D$ is integrable. This implies that through any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists a unique maximal connected $2$-dimensional submanifold $S$ (the integral manifold) such that for all $q \\in S$, the tangent space $T_qS$ is equal to $D_q$. For our distribution, this condition is $T_qS = \\operatorname{span}\\{\\partial_{x}|_{q}, \\partial_{y}|_{q}\\}$. This means the tangent plane to the surface $S$ at any point $q$ is the horizontal plane parallel to the $xy$-plane. The only surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with this property are planes defined by the equation $z = c$ for some constant $c$. These are the maximal integral manifolds of $D$.\n\nThe problem then requires us to find a smooth submersion $F:\\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that the connected components of its level sets are these integral manifolds. A level set of $F$ is a surface defined by the equation $F(x,y,z) = c$ for some constant $c$. We want these surfaces to be the planes $z=c$. The most direct choice for such a function is $F(x,y,z) = z$.\n\nLet's verify that this function $F(x,y,z) = z$ satisfies all the required properties.\n1.  **Smoothness**: $F(x,y,z) = z$ is a polynomial function, and is therefore smooth (class $C^{\\infty}$).\n2.  **Submersion**: A map is a submersion if its differential is surjective at every point. The differential $dF$ of $F$ is a linear map from $T_p\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $T_{F(p)}\\mathbb{R}$. In coordinates, it is represented by the Jacobian matrix:\n    $$dF = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The rank of this matrix is $1$ for all $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Since the dimension of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ is $1$, the differential is surjective everywhere. Thus, $F$ is a submersion.\n3.  **Annihilation of D**: We must show that the differential $dF$ annihilates the distribution $D$, meaning $dF(v) = 0$ for any vector $v \\in D$. It is sufficient to check this for the basis vectors of $D$. The action of the differential on a vector field $V$ is given by $dF(V) = V(F)$.\n    For $X = \\partial_{x}$:\n    $$dF(\\partial_{x}) = \\partial_{x}(F) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(z) = 0$$\n    For $Y = \\partial_{y}$:\n    $$dF(\\partial_{y}) = \\partial_{y}(F) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(z) = 0$$\n    Since $dF$ annihilates the basis vector fields of $D$, it annihilates any linear combination of them, and thus annihilates $D$ everywhere.\n4.  **Minimal Algebraic Complexity**: The level sets of $F(x,y,z)=z$ are precisely the planes $z=c$. Any other function $G$ whose level sets are these same planes must be of the form $G(x,y,z) = g(F(x,y,z)) = g(z)$ for some function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. For $G$ to be a submersion, $g'(z)$ must be non-zero everywhere. The choice $g(z)=z$, which gives $F(x,y,z)=z$, is a linear function. A non-constant function cannot have a lower degree of algebraic complexity. Therefore, $F(x,y,z)=z$ is the function of minimal algebraic complexity that satisfies the conditions.\n\nThe function is $F(x,y,z)=z$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{z}\n$$", "id": "3046300"}, {"introduction": "After seeing an integrable system, it is crucial to understand what prevents a distribution from being integrable.

We can find the rank by identifying a non-zero minor of the largest possible size. The submatrix formed by the first $2$ rows is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe determinant of this submatrix is $1 \\times 1 - 0 \\times 0 = 1$, which is non-zero. This demonstrates that the rank of the matrix $M$ is $2$ for all values of $x$, $y$, and $z$. Since the rank is $2$, the two column vectors are linearly independent at every point in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Therefore, the vector fields $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are pointwise linearly independent on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nNext, we compute the Lie bracket $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$. The problem states that we must use the definition of the Lie bracket via its action on a smooth function $g(x,y,z)$ and the given rules for the action of a vector field on the coordinate functions. Let $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ be a vector field $V = v_{1}\\partial_{x} + v_{2}\\partial_{y} + v_{3}\\partial_{z}$. Its components $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, and $v_{3}$ are given by the action of the bracket on the coordinate functions $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively.\n\nWe use the relations:\n$X_{1}(x) = 1$, $X_{1}(y) = 0$, $X_{1}(z) = xy$.\n$X_{2}(x) = 0$, $X_{2}(y) = 1$, $X_{2}(z) = 0$.\n\nThe first component of $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ is:\n$$\nv_{1} = [X_{1}, X_{2}](x) = X_{1}(X_{2}(x)) - X_{2}(X_{1}(x)) = X_{1}(0) - X_{2}(1) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n$$\nThe second component is:\n$$\nv_{2} = [X_{1}, X_{2}](y) = X_{1}(X_{2}(y)) - X_{2}(X_{1}(y)) = X_{1}(1) - X_{2}(0) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n$$\nThe third component is:\n$$\nv_{3} = [X_{1}, X_{2}](z) = X_{1}(X_{2}(z)) - X_{2}(X_{1}(z)) = X_{1}(0) - X_{2}(xy).\n$$\nTo evaluate $X_{2}(xy)$, we recognize that $X_{2} = \\partial_{y}$ acts as a partial derivative with respect to $y$. Thus, $X_{2}(xy) = \\partial_{y}(xy) = x$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\nv_{3} = 0 - x = -x.\n$$\nTherefore, the Lie bracket is $[X_{1}, X_{2}] = 0\\cdot\\partial_{x} + 0\\cdot\\partial_{y} + (-x)\\cdot\\partial_{z} = -x\\,\\partial_{z}$.\n\nNow, we form the scalar function $f(x,y,z)$ defined as the determinant of the $3 \\times 3$ matrix whose columns are the coordinate components of $X_{1}$, $X_{2}$, and $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$.\nThe coordinate vectors are:\n$$\nX_{1} \\longleftrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ xy \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad X_{2} \\longleftrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad [X_{1}, X_{2}] \\longleftrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -x \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe function $f(x,y,z)$ is the determinant of the matrix formed by these three vectors:\n$$\nf(x,y,z) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ xy & 0 & -x \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nWe compute the determinant, for instance, by cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$\nf(x,y,z) = 1 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -x \\end{pmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ xy & -x \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ xy & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot (-x) - 0 \\cdot 0) = -x.\n$$\nThe simplified analytic expression for $f(x,y,z)$ is $-x$.\n\nFinally, we explain the significance of the function $f(x,y,z)$. The value of $f(x,y,z)$ at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the determinant of the matrix whose columns are the coordinate vectors of $X_{1}(p)$, $X_{2}(p)$, and $[X_{1}, X_{2}](p)$. A fundamental property of the determinant is that it is non-zero if and only if its column vectors are linearly independent.\nThus, $f(x,y,z) \\neq 0$ if and only if the vector $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ is linearly independent of $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$. This means that $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ does not lie in the plane spanned by $\\{X_{1}, X_{2}\\}$, which is the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$.\nConversely, $f(x,y,z) = 0$ if and only if $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ is a linear combination of $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, meaning $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ lies within the plane defined by the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$.\nThe Frobenius theorem of integrability states that a distribution is integrable (i.e., it is the tangent bundle of a foliation) if and only if it is involutive. For a rank-$2$ distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ spanned by $\\{X_{1}, X_{2}\\}$, involutivity requires that the Lie bracket $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ lies within the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ at every point. This condition is equivalent to $f(x,y,z) = 0$ for all $(x,y,z)$.\nIn our case, $f(x,y,z) = -x$. The condition $f(x,y,z)=0$ holds only on the plane $x=0$. Therefore, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is involutive (and hence integrable) only on the submanifold defined by $x=0$. Everywhere else (where $x \\neq 0$), the distribution is not involutive, and by the Frobenius theorem, it is not integrable.

Thus, $D$ is a well-defined rank-$2$ smooth distribution. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n1. Justification of Integrability:\nAccording to the Frobenius theorem, a smooth distribution $D$ is integrable if and only if it is involutive. A distribution spanned by a set of vector fields $\\{Y_{i}\\}$ is involutive if the Lie bracket $[Y_{i}, Y_{j}]$ of any two vector fields from the spanning set lies within the distribution $D$ at every point. In our case, $D$ is spanned by $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, so we need to compute their Lie bracket $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ and check if it is a linear combination of $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$.\n\nThe Lie bracket is defined as $[X_{1}, X_{2}] = X_{1}X_{2} - X_{2}X_{1}$. We apply this operator to an arbitrary smooth function $f(x,y,z)$:\n$$\n[X_{1}, X_{2}](f) = X_{1}(X_{2}(f)) - X_{2}(X_{1}(f))\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)(f)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for the second term:\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nSince the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are Cartesian, we have $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}=0$ and the mixed partial derivatives are equal (Clairaut's theorem for smooth functions), i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z\\partial x}$.\n$$\n[X_{1}, X_{2}](f) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $[X_{1}, X_{2}](f)=0$ for any smooth function $f$, the Lie bracket is the zero vector field, $[X_{1}, X_{2}] = 0$. The zero vector field is trivially in any vector space, so $0 \\in D_{q}$ for all $q \\in M$. Therefore, the distribution $D$ is involutive. By the Frobenius theorem, $D$ is integrable.\n\n2. Construction of Local Coordinates:\nWe seek a new local coordinate system $(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3})$ in a neighborhood of $p=(0,0,0)$ such that $x^{i}(p)=0$ for $i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, and the distribution $D$ is spanned by $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2}}$. This implies that the level sets of the function $x^{3}$ are the integral manifolds (leaves) of the distribution $D$. Therefore, $x^{3}$ must be a common first integral of $X_1$ and $X_2$, meaning it must be constant along their integral curves. This is equivalent to the conditions $X_{1}(x^{3})=0$ and $X_{2}(x^{3})=0$.\n\nFirst, we find $x^{3}=\\phi(x,y,z)$:\nThe condition $X_{2}(x^{3}) = 0$ implies $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z} = 0$. This means $\\phi$ is a function of $x$ and $y$ only, so $\\phi(x,y,z) = g(x,y)$.\nThe condition $X_{1}(x^{3}) = 0$ implies $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})g(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 0$. This implies $g$ is a function of $y$ only, so $g(x,y) = h(y)$.\nThus, any function of $y$ is a first integral. We choose the simplest non-constant function and set $x^{3}(x,y,z) = y$. We check the condition at $p$: $x^{3}(0,0,0) = 0$, which is satisfied.\n\nNext, we construct $x^{1}$ and $x^{2}$. The problem specifies that we should construct them so that $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ become the coordinate vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2}}$. This is equivalent to the set of conditions:\n$X_{1}(x^{1})=1$, $X_{1}(x^{2})=0$, $X_{1}(x^{3})=0$.\n$X_{2}(x^{1})=0$, $X_{2}(x^{2})=1$, $X_{2}(x^{3})=0$.\nOur choice $x^{3}=y$ already satisfies $X_{1}(x^{3}) = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(y) = 0$ and $X_{2}(x^{3}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(y) = 0$.\n\nLet's find $x^{1}(x,y,z)$:\n$X_{2}(x^{1})=0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial z} = 0$, so $x^{1}$ is a function of $x$ and $y$ only, $x^{1}(x,y)$.\n$X_{1}(x^{1})=1 \\implies (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})x^{1}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial x} = 1$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives $x^{1}(x,y) = x + k(y)$ for some function $k$.\nThe condition $x^{1}(0,0,0)=0$ implies $0+k(0)=0$, so $k(0)=0$. The simplest choice is $k(y)=0$. Thus, we set $x^{1}(x,y,z) = x$.\n\nNow let's find $x^{2}(x,y,z)$:\n$X_{2}(x^{2})=1 \\implies \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial z} = 1$.\nIntegrating with respect to $z$ gives $x^{2}(x,y,z) = z + j(x,y)$ for some function $j$.\n$X_{1}(x^{2})=0 \\implies (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(z+j(x,y)) = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(z+j(x,y)) + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(z+j(x,y)) = \\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x} + y(1) = 0$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x} = -y$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives $j(x,y) = -xy + m(y)$ for some function $m$.\nSo, $x^{2}(x,y,z) = z - xy + m(y)$.\nThe condition $x^{2}(0,0,0)=0$ implies $0 - 0 + m(0) = 0$, so $m(0)=0$. The simplest choice is $m(y)=0$. Thus, we set $x^{2}(x,y,z) = z - xy$.\n\nOur candidate coordinate system is $(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}) = (x, z-xy, y)$. All three functions evaluate to $0$ at $(0,0,0)$.\n\n3. Verification as a Local Diffeomorphism:\nWe consider the coordinate transformation map $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by $\\Phi(x,y,z) = (x^{1}(x,y,z), x^{2}(x,y,z), x^{3}(x,y,z)) = (x, z-xy, y)$. For this map to be a local diffeomorphism at $p=(0,0,0)$, its Jacobian matrix must be invertible at that point. The Jacobian matrix is $J = \\frac{\\partial(x^{1},x^{2},x^{3})}{\\partial(x,y,z)}$.\n$$\nJ(x,y,z) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial x^{3}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x^{3}}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial x^{3}}{\\partial z}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-y & -x & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the point $p=(0,0,0)$:\n$$\nJ(0,0,0) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-0 & -0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(J(0,0,0)) = 1 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 0 + 0 = -1\n$$\nSince $\\det(J(0,0,0)) = -1 \\neq 0$, the Jacobian matrix is invertible at $p=(0,0,0)$. By the Inverse Function Theorem, the map $\\Phi$ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of $p$.\nThe constructed coordinate system $(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}) = (x, z-xy, y)$ satisfies all the requirements of the problem.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered triple of functions defining the new coordinates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(x, z - xy, y)}\n$$", "id": "3044256"}]}
