A finite subcover is a finite subfamily whose union still contains $X$.\n- A space is compact if and only if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nWe analyze each option for two properties: (i) whether it is an open cover of $[0,1)$, and (ii) whether it has no finite subcover.\n\nOption A: $\\mathcal{U}_A = \\{\\, [x, x + \\tfrac{1}{2}(1-x)) : x \\in [0,1) \\,\\}$.\n- Openness: Each set is of the form $[x, x+\\varepsilon)$ with $\\varepsilon = \\tfrac{1}{2}(1-x) > 0$ for $x \\in [0,1)$. Therefore each member of $\\mathcal{U}_A$ is a basic open set in the lower limit topology, hence open.\n- Covering: For any $y \\in [0,1)$, choose $x = y$. Then $y \\in [y, y + \\tfrac{1}{2}(1-y))$, so $[0,1)$ is covered by $\\mathcal{U}_A$.\n- No finite subcover: Take any finite subfamily $\\{ [x_i, x_i + \\tfrac{1}{2}(1-x_i)) \\}_{i=1}^n$ from $\\mathcal{U}_A$.

A full solution and analysis of the options will be provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Setup\nFirst, we analyze the components of the problem based on the provided definitions.\n\n1.  **Topology of $\\{0\\}$**: The set $\\{0\\}$ inherits the subspace topology from $\\mathbb{R}$. The open sets in $\\{0\\}$ are of the form $U \\cap \\{0\\}$, where $U$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$. If $0 \\notin U$, then $U \\cap \\{0\\} = \\emptyset$. If $0 \\in U$, then $U \\cap \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$. Therefore, the topology on $\\{0\\}$ is $\\mathcal{T}_{\\{0\\}} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{0\\}\\}$.\n\n2.  **Continuity of $f$**: A function is continuous if the preimage of every open set in the codomain is an open set in the domain. We check the open sets in $\\mathcal{T}_{\\{0\\}}$:\n    - Preimage of $\\emptyset$: $f^{-1}(\\emptyset) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\in \\emptyset\\} = \\emptyset$. The empty set $\\emptyset$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    - Preimage of $\\{0\\}$: $f^{-1}(\\{0\\}) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\in \\{0\\}\\} = \\mathbb{R}$. The set $\\mathbb{R}$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    Since the preimages of all open sets in $\\{0\\}$ are open in $\\mathbb{R}$, the map $f$ is continuous.\n\n3.  **Compactness of $\\{0\\}$**: A set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. Let $\\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $\\{0\\}$. $\\mathcal{U}$ must be a collection of subsets of $\\{0\\}$ from its topology $\\mathcal{T}_{\\{0\\}}$ whose union is $\\{0\\}$. For the union to be $\\{0\\}$, the set $\\{0\\}$ itself must be an element of $\\mathcal{U}$. The collection consisting of just this single set, i.e., $\\{\\{0\\}\\}$, is a finite subcover. Thus, $\\{0\\}$ is compact.\n\n4.  **Compactness of $\\mathbb{R}$**: The set $\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact. Consider the open cover $\\mathcal{C} = \\{(-n, n) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Any finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ is of the form $\\{(-n_1, n_1), \\dots, (-n_k, n_k)\\}$. The union of this finite subcollection is $(-N, N)$ where $N = \\max\\{n_1, \\dots, n_k\\}$. This union does not cover all of $\\mathbb{R}$ (e.g., $N+1$ is not in the union). Therefore, no finite subcover exists, and $\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The map $f$ is continuous, $\\{0\\}$ is compact, but $f^{-1}(\\{0\\})=\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact; hence this example shows that preimages of compact sets under continuous maps need not be compact.**\n\n- **\"The map $f$ is continuous\"**: True, as demonstrated above.\n- **\"$\\{0\\}$ is compact\"**: True, as demonstrated above.\n- **\"$f^{-1}(\\{0\\})=\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact\"**: True, as demonstrated above.\n- **\"hence this example shows that preimages of compact sets under continuous maps need not be compact\"**: This conclusion correctly follows from the preceding true statements. We have a continuous map $f$, a compact set $K=\\{0\\}$ in the codomain, and its preimage $f^{-1}(K)=\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact.\n\nThe entire statement is a correct logical deduction based on true premises.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In any metric space, the preimage of a compact set under a continuous map is compact.**\n\nThis statement is a general claim about all metric spaces. Option A provides a direct and decisive counterexample. The domain is the metric space $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$ with the standard metric $d(x,y)=|x-y|$. The codomain can be considered the metric space $(\\{0\\},d')$, where the metric is trivial ($d'(0,0)=0$). The set $\\{0\\}$ is a compact subset of the codomain. The map $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\{0\\}$ is continuous. The preimage $f^{-1}(\\{0\\})=\\mathbb{R}$ is not a compact subset of the domain. Therefore, the general statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The example $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\{0\\}$ shows that continuous images of non-compact sets can be compact.**\n\n- The domain is $\\mathbb{R}$, which is a non-compact set.\n- The map $f$ is continuous.\n- The image of the domain is $f(\\mathbb{R}) = \\{y \\in \\{0\\} \\mid y=f(x) \\text{ for some } x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n- The image set $\\{0\\}$ is compact, as shown in the analysis for option A.\nThis example demonstrates a continuous map from a non-compact set ($\\mathbb{R}$) to a compact set ($\\{0\\}$). The statement is therefore a correct observation. It highlights that the theorem \"the continuous image of a compact set is compact\" does not have a true converse.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard metric, compactness, limit point compactness, and sequential compactness are equivalent properties for subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n\nThis is a fundamental theorem in the study of metric spaces. For any metric space $(X, d)$, the following implications hold for a subset $A \\subseteq X$:\n1.  If $A$ is compact, then $A$ is limit point compact.\n2.  If $A$ is compact, then $A$ is sequentially compact.\nIn general metric spaces, the converses do not hold. However, for metric spaces, it is a theorem that all three properties are equivalent: $A$ is compact $\\iff$ $A$ is limit point compact $\\iff$ $A$ is sequentially compact. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard metric is a metric space, this equivalence holds for all of its subsets.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. By the Heine–Borel theorem, $f^{-1}(\\{0\\})$ is compact because $\\{0\\}$ is closed and bounded.**\n\n- The set whose compactness is being asserted is $f^{-1}(\\{0\\})$, which is $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- The claim is that $\\mathbb{R}$ is compact. This is false.\n- The justification provided is \"because $\\{0\\}$ is closed and bounded\".\n- The Heine-Borel theorem states that a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if **it** is closed and bounded. To determine if $\\mathbb{R}$ is compact using this theorem, one must check if $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}$. While $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed in itself, it is not bounded. Therefore, by the Heine-Borel theorem, $\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact.\n- The statement makes two critical errors:\n    1. It incorrectly claims $\\mathbb{R}$ is compact.\n    2. It misapplies the Heine-Borel theorem by using the properties of the set $\\{0\\}$ to justify a claim about the set $\\mathbb{R}$. The properties of being closed and bounded must be checked for the set being tested for compactness, not some other set.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3043039"}, {"introduction": "The Lebesgue number lemma is a powerful quantitative consequence of compactness in metric spaces, guaranteeing that any sufficiently 'small' region lies entirely within some set of an open cover.

The space is equipped with the geodesic distance $d$.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem based on the provided definitions. A number $\\delta > 0$ is a Lebesgue number for the cover $\\mathcal{U}$ if for every point $x \\in S^1$, the open ball $B_d(x, \\delta) = \\{y \\in S^1 : d(x,y) < \\delta\\}$ is entirely contained in at least one of the sets of the cover. That is, for every $x \\in S^1$, we must have $B_d(x, \\delta) \\subseteq U_1$ or $B_d(x, \\delta) \\subseteq U_2$.\n\nThe condition $B_d(x, \\delta) \\subseteq U_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ is equivalent to the statement that the ball $B_d(x, \\delta)$ does not intersect the complement of $U_i$. Let $C_i = S^1 \\setminus U_i$. This is equivalent to requiring that the distance from $x$ to the closed set $C_i$ be greater than or equal to $\\delta$. The distance from a point $x$ to a set $C$ is defined as $d(x, C) = \\inf_{y \\in C} d(x,y)$. Thus, the Lebesgue number condition is: for every $x \\in S^1$, $d(x, C_1) \\geq \\delta$ or $d(x, C_2) \\geq \\delta$.\n\nWe must find the largest $\\delta$ that satisfies this property for all $x \\in S^1$.\n\nLet us identify the complement sets $C_1$ and $C_2$. The points on the circle are parameterized by an angle $\\theta$, which we may take to lie in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe first open set is $U_1 = \\{e^{i\\theta} : -\\alpha < \\theta < \\pi + \\alpha\\}$. Modulo $2\\pi$, this corresponds to the union of intervals $(2\\pi-\\alpha, 2\\pi) \\cup [0, \\pi+\\alpha)$. The complement $C_1 = S^1 \\setminus U_1$ is the closed arc of points $\\{e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in [\\pi+\\alpha, 2\\pi-\\alpha]\\}$. The length of this arc is $(2\\pi-\\alpha) - (\\pi+\\alpha) = \\pi - 2\\alpha$.\n\nThe second open set is $U_2 = \\{e^{i\\theta} : \\pi - \\alpha < \\theta < 2\\pi + \\alpha\\}$. Modulo $2\\pi$, this corresponds to the union of intervals $(\\pi-\\alpha, 2\\pi) \\cup [0, \\alpha)$. The complement $C_2 = S^1 \\setminus U_2$ is the closed arc of points $\\{e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in [\\alpha, \\pi-\\alpha]\\}$. The length of this arc is $(\\pi-\\alpha) - \\alpha = \\pi - 2\\alpha$.\nThe condition $0 < \\alpha < \\pi/2$ ensures that these arc lengths are positive.\n\nWe will find the largest Lebesgue number $\\delta(\\alpha)$ by establishing an upper and a lower bound for it.\n\nPart 1: Finding an upper bound for $\\delta(\\alpha)$.\nLet $\\delta(\\alpha)$ be the largest Lebesgue number. We will show that $\\delta(\\alpha) \\leq \\alpha$. To do this, we must show that any number $\\delta' > \\alpha$ is not a Lebesgue number. We can demonstrate this by finding a point $x_0 \\in S^1$ such that the ball $B_d(x_0, \\delta')$ is not contained in $U_1$ and also not contained in $U_2$.\n\nConsider the point $x_0$ corresponding to $\\theta = 0$, i.e., $x_0 = e^{i0}$. Let $\\delta' > \\alpha$. The open ball $B_d(x_0, \\delta')$ consists of points $e^{i\\theta}$ such that $d(0, \\theta) < \\delta'$. Assuming $\\delta' < \\pi$, this is the open arc corresponding to $\\theta \\in (-\\delta', \\delta')$.\n\nWe check if $B_d(x_0, \\delta') \\subseteq U_1$. The set $U_1$ corresponds to angles $(-\\alpha, \\pi+\\alpha)$. Since $\\delta' > \\alpha$, the left endpoint of the interval $(-\\delta', \\delta')$ is $-\\delta'$, which is less than $-\\alpha$. Thus, the point $e^{-i\\delta'}$ is in $B_d(x_0, \\delta')$ but not in $U_1$. Therefore, $B_d(x_0, \\delta') \\not\\subseteq U_1$.\n\nNext, we check if $B_d(x_0, \\delta') \\subseteq U_2$. The set $U_2$ corresponds to angles $(\\pi-\\alpha, 2\\pi+\\alpha)$. The endpoints of the angular interval $(-\\delta', \\delta')$ must both lie within $(\\pi-\\alpha, 2\\pi+\\alpha)$. The right endpoint $\\delta'$ must satisfy $\\delta' < 2\\pi+\\alpha$, which is true. The left endpoint $-\\delta'$ must satisfy $\\pi-\\alpha < -\\delta'$. This inequality is equivalent to $\\delta' < \\alpha-\\pi$, which is impossible since $\\delta' > 0$ and $\\alpha < \\pi/2$. A simpler argument is to note that the interval $(-\\delta', \\delta')$ must be a subset of the set of angles for $U_2$, which, on $[0, 2\\pi)$, is $(\\pi-\\alpha, 2\\pi) \\cup [0, \\alpha)$. Since $\\delta' > \\alpha$, the point $e^{i\\delta'}$ is in the ball but not in $U_2$. Therefore, $B_d(x_0, \\delta') \\not\\subseteq U_2$.\n\nSince we have found a point $x_0$ for which the ball $B_d(x_0, \\delta')$ is in neither set of the cover, no $\\delta' > \\alpha$ can be a Lebesgue number. This establishes the upper bound: $\\delta(\\alpha) \\leq \\alpha$.\n\nPart 2: Showing $\\alpha$ is a Lebesgue number.\nWe now show that $\\delta = \\alpha$ satisfies the Lebesgue number condition. We must prove that for any $x \\in S^1$, the ball $B_d(x, \\alpha)$ is contained in either $U_1$ or $U_2$. As established earlier, this is equivalent to showing that for any $x \\in S^1$, either $d(x, C_1) \\geq \\alpha$ or $d(x, C_2) \\geq \\alpha$.\n\nLet's proceed by contradiction. Assume there exists a point $x \\in S^1$ such that $d(x, C_1) < \\alpha$ and $d(x, C_2) < \\alpha$.\nThe condition $d(x, C_1) < \\alpha$ means that $x$ belongs to the open $\\alpha$-neighborhood of the set $C_1$. The set $C_1$ is the closed arc $[\\pi+\\alpha, 2\\pi-\\alpha]$. Its $\\alpha$-neighborhood is formed by taking the union of open balls of radius $\\alpha$ centered at each point of $C_1$. Since $C_1$ is a connected arc, this neighborhood is an open arc whose endpoints are at distance $\\alpha$ from the endpoints of $C_1$. The endpoints of this neighborhood arc are at angles $(\\pi+\\alpha)-\\alpha = \\pi$ and $(2\\pi-\\alpha)+\\alpha = 2\\pi \\equiv 0$. The set of points $\\{x : d(x, C_1) < \\alpha\\}$ is therefore the open arc $\\{e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)\\}$.\n\nSimilarly, the condition $d(x, C_2) < \\alpha$ means $x$ is in the open $\\alpha$-neighborhood of $C_2$. The set $C_2$ is the closed arc $[\\alpha, \\pi-\\alpha]$. The endpoints of its $\\alpha$-neighborhood are at angles $\\alpha-\\alpha = 0$ and $(\\pi-\\alpha)+\\alpha = \\pi$. The set of points $\\{x : d(x, C_2) < \\alpha\\}$ is the open arc $\\{e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in (0, \\pi)\\}$.\n\nIf a point $x$ existed such that both conditions held, its angle $\\theta$ would have to be in the intersection of the angular intervals $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$ and $(0, \\pi)$. This intersection is the empty set. Therefore, no such point $x$ exists.\n\nThe contradiction proves that for any $x \\in S^1$, it is not possible for both $d(x, C_1) < \\alpha$ and $d(x, C_2) < \\alpha$ to be true. Consequently, for any $x \\in S^1$, at least one of the conditions $d(x, C_1) \\geq \\alpha$ or $d(x, C_2) \\geq \\alpha$ must hold. This confirms that $\\alpha$ is a Lebesgue number.\n\nConclusion:\nFrom Part 1, we have $\\delta(\\alpha) \\leq \\alpha$. From Part 2, we know that $\\alpha$ is a Lebesgue number, which implies $\\delta(\\alpha) \\geq \\alpha$. Combining these two results, we find that the largest Lebesgue number is precisely $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\alpha}$$", "id": "3043030"}]}
