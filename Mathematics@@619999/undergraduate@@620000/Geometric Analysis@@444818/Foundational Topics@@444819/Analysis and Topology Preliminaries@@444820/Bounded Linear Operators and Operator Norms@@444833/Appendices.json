Your justification should explain why the supremum in the definition of the operator norm is attained, and identify at least one unit vector where the maximum is achieved. Express the final answer as a single exact real number.", "solution": "The problem is to compute the operator norm of the linear map $T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ defined by $T(x,y)=(2x,3y)$, where both the domain and codomain are equipped with the standard Euclidean norm $\\|(x,y)\\|_2 = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$.\n\nThe operator norm $\\|T\\|$ is defined as the supremum of the norms of the images of all unit vectors. For a vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we will denote its Euclidean norm as $\\|v\\|$. The definition of the operator norm is:\n$$\n\\|T\\| = \\sup_{\\|v\\|=1} \\|T(v)\\|\n$$\nLet $v = (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ be an arbitrary vector. The condition that $v$ is a unit vector translates to the constraint $\\|v\\| = 1$, which is equivalent to $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This equation describes the unit circle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which we denote by $S^1$.\n\nThe image of $v=(x,y)$ under $T$ is $T(v) = (2x, 3y)$. The norm of this image vector is:\n$$\n\\|T(v)\\| = \\|(2x, 3y)\\| = \\sqrt{(2x)^2 + (3y)^2} = \\sqrt{4x^2 + 9y^2}\n$$\nTherefore, the problem is to find the value of:\n$$\n\\|T\\| = \\sup_{x^2+y^2=1} \\sqrt{4x^2 + 9y^2}\n$$\nFirst, we must rigorously establish that this supremum is in fact a maximum. Let the function $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x,y) = \\sqrt{4x^2 + 9y^2}$. This function is a composition of the square root function and a polynomial function, both of which are continuous. Thus, $f(x,y)$ is continuous on its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The domain over which we are optimizing is the unit circle $S^1 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the set $S^1$ is closed and bounded. By the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Therefore, $S^1$ is a compact set.\n\nAccording to the Extreme Value Theorem, a continuous function defined on a compact set must attain its maximum and minimum values on that set. Since $f(x,y)$ is continuous on the compact set $S^1$, it must attain a maximum value. This justifies replacing the supremum with a maximum:\n$$\n\\|T\\| = \\max_{x^2+y^2=1} \\sqrt{4x^2 + 9y^2}\n$$\nTo find this maximum value, we can equivalently maximize the square of the function, $F(x,y) = (f(x,y))^2 = 4x^2 + 9y^2$, subject to the constraint $x^2+y^2=1$. This is because the square root function $z \\mapsto \\sqrt{z}$ is strictly increasing for $z \\ge 0$.\n\nWe can solve this optimization problem by parameterizing the unit circle. Any point $(x,y)$ on the unit circle can be represented as $x = \\cos(\\theta)$ and $y = \\sin(\\theta)$ for some angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Substituting this parameterization into the function $F(x,y)$, we obtain a function of a single variable $\\theta$:\n$$\ng(\\theta) = F(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta)) = 4\\cos^2(\\theta) + 9\\sin^2(\\theta)\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) = 1 - \\sin^2(\\theta)$:\n$$\ng(\\theta) = 4(1 - \\sin^2(\\theta)) + 9\\sin^2(\\theta) = 4 - 4\\sin^2(\\theta) + 9\\sin^2(\\theta) = 4 + 5\\sin^2(\\theta)\n$$\nTo maximize $g(\\theta)$, we need to maximize the term $\\sin^2(\\theta)$. The values of $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ range from $0$ to $1$. The maximum value is $1$, which occurs when $\\sin(\\theta) = \\pm 1$. This happens when $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAt these values of $\\theta$:\n- If $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $x = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$ and $y = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$. The corresponding unit vector is $v_1 = (0, 1)$.\n- If $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, we have $x = \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = 0$ and $y = \\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -1$. The corresponding unit vector is $v_2 = (0,-1)$.\n\nThe maximum value of the function $g(\\theta)$ is:\n$$\ng_{max} = 4 + 5(1) = 9\n$$\nThis is the maximum value of $F(x,y) = \\|T(v)\\|^2$. To find the operator norm $\\|T\\|$, we take the square root of this maximum value:\n$$\n\\|T\\| = \\sqrt{g_{max}} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\nAs required, we have identified at least one unit vector where this maximum is achieved. For the unit vector $v=(0,1)$:\n$$\n\\|T(0,1)\\| = \\|(2(0), 3(1))\\| = \\|(0,3)\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\nThis confirms that the maximum value is indeed $3$. The other unit vector where the maximum is attained is $v=(0, -1)$.\nThe operator norm of $T$ is the maximum value of $\\|T(v)\\|$ for $\\|v\\|=1$, which we have rigorously shown to be $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3041944"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the operator norm in a finite-dimensional geometric context, we now generalize this concept to the infinite-dimensional world of function spaces.

The space is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the Euclidean norm $\\|(x,y)\\|_2 = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$.\n\nFirst, we construct the projection $P$. A projection is a linear operator satisfying $P^{2}=P$. We are given that the range of $P$ is $U=\\operatorname{span}\\{(1,0)\\}$ and the nullspace (or kernel) of $P$ is $W=\\operatorname{span}\\{(1,1)\\}$. The vectors $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ are linearly independent, so they form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. This implies that any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ can be uniquely written as a direct sum $v = u+w$ where $u \\in U$ and $w \\in W$. The projection $P$ onto $U$ along $W$ is defined by $P(v) = u$.\n\nLet $v=(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. We want to find scalars $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that\n$$ (x,y) = c_1(1,0) + c_2(1,1) $$\nHere, $u = c_1(1,0) \\in U$ and $w = c_2(1,1) \\in W$.\nThis vector equation corresponds to the system of linear equations:\n$$ x = c_1 + c_2 $$\n$$ y = c_2 $$\nSolving for $c_1$ and $c_2$, we find $c_2 = y$ and $c_1 = x - c_2 = x-y$.\nSo, the decomposition of $v$ is $(x,y) = (x-y)(1,0) + y(1,1)$.\nBy definition, the projection $P$ maps $v$ to its component in $U$:\n$$ P(v) = P(x,y) = (x-y)(1,0) = (x-y, 0) $$\nWe can represent this linear operator by a matrix with respect to the standard basis $\\{(1,0), (0,1)\\}$.\n$$ P\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x-y \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe matrix for $P$ is $M_P = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nLet's verify $P^2=P$:\n$P(P(x,y)) = P(x-y, 0)$. Let $x' = x-y$ and $y' = 0$. Then $P(x', y') = (x'-y', 0) = ((x-y)-0, 0) = (x-y, 0) = P(x,y)$. Thus, $P^2=P$ is confirmed.\n\nSecond, we verify that $P$ is not an orthogonal projection. An orthogonal projection in a Hilbert space is a projection that is also self-adjoint ($P=P^*$). In $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard inner product (which induces the Euclidean norm), an operator is self-adjoint if and only if its matrix representation in the standard orthonormal basis is symmetric.\nThe matrix for $P$ is $M_P = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe matrix for the adjoint operator $P^*$ is the conjugate transpose of $M_P$. Since the entries are real, this is just the transpose:\n$$ M_{P^*} = M_P^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $M_P \\neq M_P^T$, the operator $P$ is not self-adjoint and therefore is not an orthogonal projection.\nAlternatively, for an orthogonal projection, the nullspace must be the orthogonal complement of the range. The range is $U=\\operatorname{span}\\{(1,0)\\}$. Its orthogonal complement $U^{\\perp}$ is the set of all vectors $(a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $(a,b) \\cdot (1,0) = 0$, which implies $a=0$. Thus, $U^{\\perp} = \\operatorname{span}\\{(0,1)\\}$. The nullspace of $P$ is given as $W=\\operatorname{span}\\{(1,1)\\}$.
