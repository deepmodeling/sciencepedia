The product space $X\\times Y$ is equipped with the norm $\\|(x,y)\\| = \\|x\\|_{X}+\\|y\\|_{Y}$.\n\n**(a) Proof that $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a Banach space.**\n\nFirst, we verify that $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed vector space. The space $X\\times Y$ is a vector space under the component-wise operations $(\\alpha(x_1, y_1) + \\beta(x_2, y_2)) = (\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2, \\alpha y_1 + \\beta y_2)$. The defined function $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is a norm:\n1.  **Positive definiteness**: For any $(x,y)\\in X\\times Y$, $\\|(x,y)\\| = \\|x\\|_{X}+\\|y\\|_{Y} \\geq 0$ since norms are non-negative. Furthermore, $\\|(x,y)\\| = 0$ if and only if $\\|x\\|_{X}=0$ and $\\|y\\|_{Y}=0$, which due to the definiteness of the norms on $X$ and $Y$, is equivalent to $x=0_X$ and $y=0_Y$. Thus, $\\|(x,y)\\| = 0$ if and only if $(x,y)=(0_X, 0_Y)$.\n2.  **Homogeneity**: For any scalar $\\alpha$ and $(x,y)\\in X\\times Y$, $\\|\\alpha(x,y)\\| = \\|(\\alpha x, \\alpha y)\\| = \\|\\alpha x\\|_{X}+\\|\\alpha y\\|_{Y} = |\\alpha|\\|x\\|_{X}+|\\alpha|\\|y\\|_{Y} = |\\alpha|(\\|x\\|_{X}+\\|y\\|_{Y}) = |\\alpha|\\|(x,y)\\|$.\n3.  **Triangle inequality**: For any $(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)\\in X\\times Y$,\n    $$\n    \\|(x_1,y_1)+(x_2,y_2)\\| = \\|(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)\\| = \\|x_1+x_2\\|_{X}+\\|y_1+y_2\\|_{Y}.\n    $$\n    By the triangle inequality on $X$ and $Y$,\n    $$\n    \\|x_1+x_2\\|_{X}+\\|y_1+y_2\\|_{Y} \\leq (\\|x_1\\|_{X}+\\|x_2\\|_{X}) + (\\|y_1\\|_{Y}+\\|y_2\\|_{Y}) = (\\|x_1\\|_{X}+\\|y_1\\|_{Y}) + (\\|x_2\\|_{X}+\\|y_2\\|_{Y}) = \\|(x_1,y_1)\\| + \\|(x_2,y_2)\\|.\n    $$\nThus, $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed vector space.\n\nTo prove it is a Banach space, we must show it is complete. Let $\\{(x_n, y_n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $X\\times Y$. By the definition of a Cauchy sequence, for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$,\n$$\n\\|(x_m, y_m)-(x_n, y_n)\\|  \\epsilon.\n$$\nUsing the definition of the norm on $X\\times Y$, this becomes\n$$\n\\|(x_m-x_n, y_m-y_n)\\| = \\|x_m-x_n\\|_{X} + \\|y_m-y_n\\|_{Y}  \\epsilon.\n$$\nSince both $\\|x_m-x_n\\|_{X}$ and $\\|y_m-y_n\\|_{Y}$ are non-negative, this implies that for all $m,n>N$,\n$$\n\\|x_m-x_n\\|_{X}  \\epsilon \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\|y_m-y_n\\|_{Y}  \\epsilon.\n$$\nThis means that $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(X,\\|\\cdot\\|_{X})$ and $\\{y_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(Y,\\|\\cdot\\|_{Y})$.\n\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces, they are complete. Therefore, the Cauchy sequences $\\{x_n\\}$ and $\\{y_n\\}$ must converge to limits within their respective spaces. Let\n$$\nx = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n \\in X \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n \\in Y.\n$$\nWe now show that the sequence $\\{(x_n, y_n)\\}$ converges to the element $(x,y) \\in X\\times Y$. We examine the norm of the difference:\n$$\n\\|(x_n, y_n)-(x,y)\\| = \\|(x_n-x, y_n-y)\\| = \\|x_n-x\\|_{X} + \\|y_n-y\\|_{Y}.\n$$\nAs $n\\to\\infty$, we have $\\|x_n-x\\|_{X} \\to 0$ and $\\|y_n-y\\|_{Y} \\to 0$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\|(x_n, y_n)-(x,y)\\| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\|x_n-x\\|_{X} + \\|y_n-y\\|_{Y}) = 0+0=0.\n$$\nThis shows that the sequence $\\{(x_n, y_n)\\}$ converges to $(x,y)$ in the space $X\\times Y$. Since we have shown that an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in $X\\times Y$ converges to an element in $X\\times Y$, the space $(X\\times Y,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ is complete. As a complete normed vector space, it is by definition a Banach space.\n\n**(b) Boundedness and operator norms of projections.**\n\nThe coordinate projections are $P_{X}:X\\times Y\\to X$ defined by $P_{X}(x,y)=x$ and $P_{Y}:X\\times Y\\to Y$ defined by $P_{Y}(x,y)=y$.\n\nFirst, we show that $P_X$ and $P_Y$ are linear operators. For any scalars $\\alpha, \\beta$ and vectors $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\in X\\times Y$:\n$$\nP_X(\\alpha(x_1,y_1)+\\beta(x_2,y_2)) = P_X(\\alpha x_1+\\beta x_2, \\alpha y_1+\\beta y_2) = \\alpha x_1+\\beta x_2 = \\alpha P_X(x_1,y_1) + \\beta P_X(x_2,y_2).\n$$\n$$\nP_Y(\\alpha(x_1,y_1)+\\beta(x_2,y_2)) = P_Y(\\alpha x_1+\\beta x_2, \\alpha y_1+\\beta y_2) = \\alpha y_1+\\beta y_2 = \\alpha P_Y(x_1,y_1) + \\beta P_Y(x_2,y_2).\n$$\nThus, both $P_X$ and $P_Y$ are linear operators.\n\nNext, we establish their boundedness. We can do this directly or by using the Closed Graph Theorem. The problem asks to use the theorem where appropriate. The domain $X\\times Y$ and codomains $X$ and $Y$ are all Banach spaces.\nLet's use the Closed Graph Theorem for $P_X$. The graph of $P_X$ is a subset of $(X\\times Y) \\times X$:\n$$\nG(P_X) = \\{((x,y), P_X(x,y)) \\mid (x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\} = \\{((x,y), x) \\mid (x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\}.\n$$\nTo show $G(P_X)$ is closed, let $\\{((x_n,y_n), z_n)\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ be a sequence in $G(P_X)$ that converges to a limit $((x,y),z) \\in (X\\times Y)\\times X$. For each $n$, we have $z_n = P_X(x_n,y_n)=x_n$.\nThe convergence means that $(x_n,y_n) \\to (x,y)$ in $X\\times Y$ and $z_n \\to z$ in $X$.\nThe convergence in $X\\times Y$ implies $\\|(x_n,y_n)-(x,y)\\| = \\|x_n-x\\|_X + \\|y_n-y\\|_Y \\to 0$. This forces $\\|x_n-x\\|_X \\to 0$, so $x_n \\to x$ in $X$.\nWe have two facts: $z_n=x_n$ for all $n$, $z_n\\to z$, and $x_n\\to x$. By the uniqueness of limits in a normed space, we must have $z=x$.\nSo the limit point is $((x,y),x)$. This point is in the form $((u,v), P_X(u,v))$ for $(u,v)=(x,y)$, so it belongs to $G(P_X)$.\nThus, $G(P_X)$ is closed. By the Closed Graph Theorem, the linear operator $P_X$ is bounded.\nAn identical argument shows that the graph of $P_Y$, $G(P_Y) = \\{((x,y), y) \\mid (x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\}$, is also closed, and therefore $P_Y$ is a bounded linear operator.\n\nNow we compute their operator norms. The operator norm of a bounded linear operator $T:V\\to W$ is given by $\\|T\\| = \\sup_{v\\neq 0} \\frac{\\|T(v)\\|_W}{\\|v\\|_V}$.\n\nFor $P_X$:\n$$\n\\|P_X\\| = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|P_X(x,y)\\|_X}{\\|(x,y)\\|} = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y}.\n$$\nSince $\\|y\\|_Y \\geq 0$, the denominator is always greater than or equal to the numerator, so $\\|x\\|_X \\leq \\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y$. This implies $\\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y} \\leq 1$ for all $(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)$. Thus, $\\|P_X\\| \\leq 1$.\nTo see if this upper bound is achieved, we consider specific elements. Assuming $X$ is not the trivial space $\\{0_X\\}$, we can choose an arbitrary $x \\in X$ with $x \\neq 0_X$ and set $y=0_Y$.\nFor such elements $(x, 0_Y)$ with $x\\neq 0_X$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|P_X(x,0_Y)\\|_X}{\\|(x,0_Y)\\|} = \\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|0_Y\\|_Y} = \\frac{\\|x\\|_X}{\\|x\\|_X+0} = 1.\n$$\nSince the value $1$ is achieved for some elements, the supremum must be $1$. Therefore, $\\|P_X\\|=1$. (If $X=\\{0_X\\}$, then $P_X$ is the zero operator and its norm is $0$.) We proceed under the standard assumption that the spaces are non-trivial.\n\nFor $P_Y$:\n$$\n\\|P_Y\\| = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|P_Y(x,y)\\|_Y}{\\|(x,y)\\|} = \\sup_{(x,y)\\neq(0_X,0_Y)} \\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y}.\n$$\nSimilarly, since $\\|x\\|_X \\geq 0$, we have $\\|y\\|_Y \\leq \\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y$, which implies $\\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{\\|x\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y} \\leq 1$. Thus, $\\|P_Y\\| \\leq 1$.\nAssuming $Y$ is not the trivial space $\\{0_Y\\}$, we can choose $y\\in Y$ with $y\\neq 0_Y$ and set $x=0_X$.\nFor such elements $(0_X, y)$ with $y\\neq 0_Y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|P_Y(0_X,y)\\|_Y}{\\|(0_X,y)\\|} = \\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{\\|0_X\\|_X+\\|y\\|_Y} = \\frac{\\|y\\|_Y}{0+\\|y\\|_Y} = 1.\n$$\nSince the value $1$ is achieved, the supremum is $1$. Therefore, $\\|P_Y\\|=1$.\n\nThe operator norms are $\\|P_X\\|=1$ and $\\|P_Y\\|=1$, assuming $X$ and $Y$ are non-trivial Banach spaces.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3057906"}, {"introduction": "The Open Mapping Theorem is a powerful and perhaps surprising result, as continuity does not generally imply openness.

Evaluation of Option A**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Example:**\n    The map is $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by\n    $$\n    f(x)=\\begin{cases}\n    x, x\\leq 0,\\\\\n    0, 0x1,\\\\\n    x-1, x\\geq 1.\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    -   **Continuity:** The function is continuous. It is defined piecewise by continuous functions. At the junction points:\n        -   At $x=0$: $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 0^-} x = 0$; $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} 0 = 0$. Since $f(0)=0$, it is continuous at $x=0$.\n        -   At $x=1$: $\\lim_{x\\to 1^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 1^-} 0 = 0$; $\\lim_{x\\to 1^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 1^+} (x-1) = 0$. Since $f(1)=1-1=0$, it is continuous at $x=1$.\n    -   **Surjectivity:** For any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n        -   If $y \\le 0$, choose $x=y$. Then $f(x)=f(y)=y$.\n        -   If $y  0$, choose $x=y+1$. Then $x  1$, and $f(x)=f(y+1)=(y+1)-1=y$.\n        Thus, the map is surjective.\n    -   **Openness:** Consider the open set $U=(0,1) \\subset \\mathbb{R}$. The image is $f(U) = \\{ f(x) \\mid x \\in (0,1) \\} = \\{0\\}$. The set $\\{0\\}$ is a singleton, which is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$ and is not open. Therefore, the map $f$ is not open.\n    The example correctly demonstrates a continuous, surjective map that is not open.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Explanation:**\n    -   The explanation correctly states the conclusion of the Open Mapping Theorem for a surjective, continuous, linear map $T$ between Banach spaces.\n    -   It correctly identifies that the proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem and, consequently, on the completeness of the spaces.\n    -   It provides a standard and correct counterexample to show that completeness is essential: the identity map $I:(c_{00},\\|\\cdot\\|_{1})\\to(c_{00},\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty})$, where $c_{00}$ is the space of sequences with finitely many non-zero terms. $c_{00}$ is not a Banach space under either norm. The map $I$ is linear, surjective, and continuous because $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_k |x_k| \\le \\sum_k |x_k| = \\|x\\|_{1}$. However, it is not open because its inverse (also the identity) is not continuous from $(c_{00},\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty})$ to $(c_{00},\\|\\cdot\\|_{1})$. To see this, consider the sequence of vectors $x_n = (1, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots)$ with $n$ ones. We have $\\|x_n\\|_{\\infty}=1$ but $\\|x_n\\|_{1}=n$, showing that there is no constant $C$ such that $\\|x\\|_{1} \\le C\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$.\n    -   Finally, it correctly notes that the Closed Graph Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Principle also depend on BCT and completeness.\n\n**Verdict on A**: This option provides a correct example and a factually accurate, comprehensive explanation. It satisfies both criteria. **Correct**.\n\n---\n\n**B. Evaluation of Option B**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Example:**\n    The map is $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x)=x^3$. This map is continuous and surjective. However, it is also an open map. Since $f$ is a strictly increasing function, it maps any open interval $(a,b)$ to the open interval $(f(a), f(b))=(a^3, b^3)$. Since any open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is a disjoint union of open intervals, its image under $f$ is a union of open intervals, which is an open set. The claim that this map is \"not open\" is false.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Explanation:**\n    The explanation claims that completeness is not required for the OMT, which is false. It further misstates the Closed Graph Theorem as \"surjectivity implies openness.\" The CGT states that a linear operator between Banach spaces is continuous if its graph is closed. Both claims are factually incorrect.\n\n**Verdict on B**: The example is incorrect, and the explanation is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**C. Evaluation of Option C**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Example:**\n    The map is $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to[0,\\infty)$ by $f(x)=\\max\\{0,x\\}$. This map is continuous and surjective. To check if it is open, consider the open set $U=(-1,1)\\subset\\mathbb{R}$. The image is $f(U) = [0,1)$. This set is not open in the codomain $[0,\\infty)$ because it contains the boundary point $0$. The option uses the open set $(-1,0)$, whose image is $\\{0\\}$, which is not open in $[0,\\infty)$. The example is correct.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Explanation:**\n    The explanation claims that openness in the Banach space case is \"purely because of linearity; completeness is not relevant.\" This is a major error; completeness is a crucial hypothesis for the OMT. It also claims the CGT guarantees openness without invoking BCT, which is false on both counts: OMT guarantees openness, and CGT's proof requires BCT.\n\n**Verdict on C**: The example is correct, but the explanation is fundamentally flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**D. Evaluation of Option D**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Example:**\n    The map is the projection $\\pi:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, $\\pi(x,y)=x$. This map is continuous and surjective. It is also an open map. Any open set $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a union of open balls. The projection of an open ball $B((x_0,y_0), r) = \\{(x,y) \\mid (x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2  r^2\\}$ is the open interval $(x_0-r, x_0+r)$. The image $\\pi(U)$ is a union of these open intervals, which is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$. The claim that $\\pi$ is \"not open\" is false.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Explanation:**\n    The explanation contains multiple errors:\n    -   It claims the OMT applies to non-linear maps, which is false.\n    -   It claims completeness can be replaced by separability, which is false.\n    -   It claims the UBP concerns non-linear operators and yields openness, both of which are false.\n\n**Verdict on D**: The example is incorrect, and the explanation is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**E. Evaluation of Option E**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Example:**\n    The map is the Cantor function $F:[0,1]\\to[0,1]$. This function is continuous and surjective. It is famously not open because it is constant on the open intervals that constitute the complement of the Cantor set. For example, $F((1/3, 2/3)) = \\{1/2\\}$, which is not an open set in $[0,1]$. The example is correct.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Explanation:**\n    The explanation claims that the UBP \"alone\" implies openness for surjective continuous maps (linearity is omitted) and that it \"does not depend on completeness.\" Both statements are false. The UBP applies to families of linear operators and its proof requires completeness. It also misrepresents the CGT.\n\n**Verdict on E**: The example is correct, but the explanation is fundamentally flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly option A provides both a correct example of a continuous, surjective map that is not open, and a correct, nuanced explanation of the Open Mapping Theorem, its reliance on completeness via the Baire Category Theorem, and its relationship to other core theorems of functional analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3057904"}, {"introduction": "This practice takes you deep into the machinery of the Open Mapping Theorem, bridging the gap between abstract proof and concrete application.

In particular, prove that there exists a constant $M0$ depending only on $T$ such that whenever $B_{X}(x_{0},r)\\subset U$ for some $x_{0}\\in X$ and $r0$, one has $B_{Y}(T(x_{0}),r/M)\\subset T(U)$.\n2. Specialize to the finite-dimensional case $X=Y=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the Euclidean norm and the operator $T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ defined by $T(x)=A x$ with\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n3  -1\\\\\n2  \\phantom{-}4\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nLet $U=B_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}(x_{0},r)$ with $x_{0}=(1,-2)$ and $r=\\tfrac{1}{2}$. Compute a rigorous lower bound $\\rho0$ such that the Euclidean ball $B_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}(T(x_{0}),\\rho)$ is guaranteed to be contained in $T(U)$. Express $\\rho$ in exact closed form. No rounding is required, and no physical units are involved.\nThe final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\rho$.", "solution": "The user has provided a two-part problem concerning the Open Mapping Theorem. The problem is valid as it is mathematically sound, well-posed, and all necessary conditions and definitions are provided.\n\n### Part 1: Proof of the Open Mapping Principle\n\nThe first task is to prove a key consequence of the Open Mapping Theorem. Let $X$ and $Y$ be Banach spaces and let $T: X \\to Y$ be a surjective bounded linear operator. We must show that for any nonempty open set $U \\subset X$, the image $T(U)$ has a nonempty interior. Specifically, we need to show the existence of a constant $M > 0$ such that if $B_X(x_0, r) \\subset U$, then $B_Y(T(x_0), r/M) \\subset T(U)$.\n\nThe proof proceeds in several steps.\n\n**Step 1: Reduction of the problem**\n\nFirst, we show that it is sufficient to prove that the image of the open unit ball in $X$, $B_X(0, 1)$, contains an open ball centered at the origin in $Y$. Let us assume that there exists some $\\delta > 0$ such that $B_Y(0, \\delta) \\subset T(B_X(0, 1))$.\n\nLet $U \\subset X$ be an arbitrary nonempty open set. For any $x_0 \\in U$, by the definition of an open set, there exists an $r > 0$ such that the open ball $B_X(x_0, r)$ is contained in $U$. An element $x \\in B_X(x_0, r)$ can be written as $x = x_0 + z$, where $z \\in B_X(0, r)$. The condition $\\|x - x_0\\|  r$ is equivalent to $\\|z\\|  r$, which can be written as $\\|(1/r)z\\|  1$. So, $B_X(x_0, r) = x_0 + r B_X(0, 1)$.\n\nSince $B_X(x_0, r) \\subset U$, we have $T(B_X(x_0, r)) \\subset T(U)$. By the linearity of $T$:\n$$T(B_X(x_0, r)) = T(x_0 + r B_X(0, 1)) = T(x_0) + T(r B_X(0, 1)) = T(x_0) + r T(B_X(0, 1))$$\nUsing our assumption that $B_Y(0, \\delta) \\subset T(B_X(0, 1))$, we get:\n$$T(U) \\supset T(x_0) + r T(B_X(0, 1)) \\supset T(x_0) + r B_Y(0, \\delta) = B_Y(T(x_0), r\\delta)$$\nThis shows that $T(U)$ contains an open ball around $T(x_0)$ for any $x_0 \\in U$, which implies $T(U)$ is open. The problem asks for a constant $M$ such that $B_Y(T(x_0), r/M) \\subset T(U)$. Comparing this with $B_Y(T(x_0), r\\delta)$, we can identify $M = 1/\\delta$. This constant $M$ depends only on $T$ (as $\\delta$ does), not on $U$, $x_0$, or $r$.\n\nThus, the core of the proof is to establish that $T(B_X(0, 1))$ contains an open ball centered at the origin in $Y$.\n\n**Step 2: Application of the Baire Category Theorem**\n\nSince $T$ is surjective, every point in $Y$ is the image of some point in $X$. We can write $X$ as the union of balls centered at the origin: $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty B_X(0, n)$. Applying $T$, we have:\n$$Y = T(X) = T\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty B_X(0, n)\\right) = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty T(B_X(0, n))$$\nSince $Y$ is a Banach space, it is a complete metric space. The Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets. Therefore, at least one of the sets in the union must not be nowhere dense. This means there exists an integer $n_0 \\ge 1$ such that the closure $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$ has a nonempty interior.\nSo, there exist $y_0 \\in Y$ and $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $B_Y(y_0, \\epsilon)$ is contained in $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$.\n\n**Step 3: Centering the ball at the origin**\n\nWe now show that the closure of the image of a ball centered at the origin in $X$ contains a ball centered at the origin in $Y$.\nWe have $B_Y(y_0, \\epsilon) \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$. The set $B_X(0, n_0)$ is symmetric with respect to the origin (i.e., if $z \\in B_X(0, n_0)$, then $-z \\in B_X(0, n_0)$).\nSince $y_0 \\in \\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))}$, the ball $B_Y(0, \\epsilon) = B_Y(y_0, \\epsilon) - y_0$ is contained in $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))} - y_0$.\nSince $y_0$ is in the closure, it is a limit point of $T(B_X(0,n_0))$. This implies $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0))} - y_0 \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0)) - T(B_X(0, n_0))}$. By linearity of $T$, this is $\\overline{T(B_X(0, n_0) - B_X(0, n_0))}$.\nFor any $u, v \\in B_X(0, n_0)$, we have $\\|u-v\\| \\le \\|u\\| + \\|v\\|  n_0 + n_0 = 2n_0$. Thus, $B_X(0, n_0) - B_X(0, n_0) \\subset B_X(0, 2n_0)$.\nCombining these facts:\n$$B_Y(0, \\epsilon) \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, 2n_0))} = \\overline{T(2n_0 B_X(0, 1))} = 2n_0 \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1))}$$\nwhere we used the linearity of $T$ and the property that for a linear operator $L$ and a set $S$, $\\overline{L(\\alpha S)} = \\alpha \\overline{L(S)}$ for a scalar $\\alpha$.\nLet $\\delta' = \\epsilon/(2n_0) > 0$. We have shown that $B_Y(0, \\delta') \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1))}$.\n\n**Step 4: The \"gluing\" argument to remove the closure**\n\nThe final step is to show that if the closure of $T(B_X(0,1))$ contains a ball, then $T(B_X(0,1))$ itself (without the closure) contains a (possibly smaller) ball. From the previous step, by scaling, we have for any $k \\ge 0$:\n$$B_Y(0, \\delta'/2^k) \\subset \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1/2^k))}$$\nLet's pick an arbitrary $y \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/2)$. We will construct an $x \\in B_X(0, 1)$ such that $T(x) = y$.\nSince $y \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/2)$, it is also in $\\overline{T(B_X(0, 1/2))}$. Thus, we can find an $x_0 \\in B_X(0, 1/2)$ such that $\\|y - T(x_0)\\|  \\delta'/4$.\nLet $y_1 = y - T(x_0)$. Then $y_1 \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/4)$.\nSince $y_1 \\in \\overline{T(B_X(0, 1/4))}$, we can find an $x_1 \\in B_X(0, 1/4)$ such that $\\|y_1 - T(x_1)\\|  \\delta'/8$.\nLet $y_2 = y_1 - T(x_1) = y - T(x_0) - T(x_1)$. Then $y_2 \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/8)$.\nContinuing this process inductively, we construct a sequence $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^\\infty$ in $X$ such that for each $k$:\n1. $x_k \\in B_X(0, 1/2^{k+1})$ (so $\\|x_k\\|  1/2^{k+1}$)\n2. $\\|y - \\sum_{i=0}^k T(x_i)\\|  \\delta'/2^{k+2}$\n\nConsider the partial sums $s_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n x_k$. For $m > n$, we have:\n$$\\|s_m - s_n\\| = \\left\\|\\sum_{k=n+1}^m x_k\\right\\| \\le \\sum_{k=n+1}^m \\|x_k\\|  \\sum_{k=n+1}^m \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}}$$\nSince the geometric series $\\sum 1/2^{k+1}$ converges, the sequence $\\{s_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. As $X$ is a Banach space, it is complete, so the sequence converges to a limit $x = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} s_n \\in X$.\nThe norm of the limit is:\n$$\\|x\\| = \\left\\|\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty x_k\\right\\| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\|x_k\\|  \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} = \\frac{1/2}{1-1/2} = 1$$\nSo, $x \\in B_X(0, 1)$.\nSince $T$ is a bounded (and thus continuous) linear operator:\n$$T(x) = T(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} s_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} T(s_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} T\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n x_k\\right) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{k=0}^n T(x_k)$$\nFrom condition 2 in our construction, $\\|y - \\sum_{i=0}^k T(x_i)\\| \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. This means $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^k T(x_i) = y$.\nTherefore, $T(x) = y$.\nWe have shown that for any $y \\in B_Y(0, \\delta'/2)$, there exists an $x \\in B_X(0, 1)$ with $T(x) = y$. This proves that $B_Y(0, \\delta'/2) \\subset T(B_X(0, 1))$.\n\nLet $\\delta = \\delta'/2$. We have established that $T(B_X(0, 1))$ contains the open ball $B_Y(0, \\delta)$. As shown in Step 1, this completes the proof with $M = 1/\\delta$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation for a Specific Operator\n\nWe are given $X = Y = \\mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean norm. The operator is $T(x) = Ax$ where $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  -1 \\\\ 2  4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The set is $U = B_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(x_0, r)$ with $x_0 = (1, -2)$ and $r = 1/2$. We need to find a rigorous lower bound $\\rho > 0$ such that $B_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(T(x_0), \\rho) \\subset T(U)$.\n\nThe image of $U$ under $T$ is:\n$$T(U) = T(B(x_0, r)) = \\{ Ax : \\|x - x_0\\|_2  r \\}$$\nLet $z = x - x_0$. Then $x = z + x_0$ and $\\|z\\|_2  r$.\n$$T(U) = \\{ A(z+x_0) : \\|z\\|_2  r \\} = \\{ Az + Ax_0 : \\|z\\|_2  r \\} = T(x_0) + \\{ Az : \\|z\\|_2  r \\}$$\nWe wish to find the largest $\\rho$ such that $B(T(x_0), \\rho) \\subset T(U)$, which is equivalent to finding the largest $\\rho$ such that $B(0, \\rho) \\subset \\{ Az : \\|z\\|_2  r \\}$.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is invertible since $\\det(A) = 3(4) - (-1)(2) = 14 \\ne 0$. Thus, $T$ is an isomorphism and we can consider its inverse $T^{-1}(y)=A^{-1}y$.\nThe set $\\{ Az : \\|z\\|_2  r \\}$ consists of all vectors $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $y = Az$ for some $z$ with $\\|z\\|_2  r$. This is equivalent to $z = A^{-1}y$, so the condition on $y$ is $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2  r$.\n\nThe problem now becomes finding the largest $\\rho$ such that the ball $\\|y\\|_2  \\rho$ is contained in the set defined by $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2  r$.\nWe know that for any vector $y$, $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2 \\le \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op} \\|y\\|_2$, where $\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$ is the operator norm of $A^{-1}$ (the spectral norm).\nIf we require $\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op} \\|y\\|_2  r$, which means $\\|y\\|_2  r / \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$, then the condition $\\|A^{-1}y\\|_2  r$ is guaranteed to be satisfied.\nThe value $\\rho = r / \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$ gives the radius of the largest ball centered at the origin that is guaranteed to be contained in the image set. In finite dimensions, this is not just a lower bound but the exact radius of the largest inscribed ball.\n\nWe now compute $\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}$. The operator norm is given by $\\|B\\|_{op} = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{max}(B^T B)}$, where $\\lambda_{max}$ is the largest eigenvalue.\nFirst, we find $A^{-1}$:\n$$A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ -2  3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{14} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ -2  3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNext, we compute $(A^{-1})^T A^{-1}$:\n$$(A^{-1})^T = \\frac{1}{14} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  -2 \\\\ 1  3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$(A^{-1})^T A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{14^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  -2 \\\\ 1  3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ -2  3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{196} \\begin{pmatrix} (4)(4)+(-2)(-2)  (4)(1)+(-2)(3) \\\\ (1)(4)+(3)(-2)  (1)(1)+(3)(3) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$(A^{-1})^T A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{196} \\begin{pmatrix} 16+4  4-6 \\\\ 4-6  1+9 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{196} \\begin{pmatrix} 20  -2 \\\\ -2  10 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nLet $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 20  -2 \\\\ -2  10 \\end{pmatrix}$. We find the eigenvalues of $C$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(C - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ (20-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda) - (-2)(-2) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 30\\lambda + 200 - 4 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 30\\lambda + 196 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula for the eigenvalues $\\lambda_C$ of $C$:\n$$ \\lambda_C = \\frac{30 \\pm \\sqrt{(-30)^2 - 4(1)(196)}}{2} = \\frac{30 \\pm \\sqrt{900 - 784}}{2} = \\frac{30 \\pm \\sqrt{116}}{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{116} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 29} = 2\\sqrt{29}$, we have:\n$$ \\lambda_C = \\frac{30 \\pm 2\\sqrt{29}}{2} = 15 \\pm \\sqrt{29} $$\nThe eigenvalues of $(A^{-1})^T A^{-1}$ are these values divided by $196$. The largest eigenvalue is:\n$$ \\lambda_{max}((A^{-1})^T A^{-1}) = \\frac{15 + \\sqrt{29}}{196} $$\nThe operator norm of $A^{-1}$ is the square root of this value:\n$$ \\|A^{-1}\\|_{op} = \\sqrt{\\frac{15 + \\sqrt{29}}{196}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}}{14} $$\nFinally, we compute $\\rho$ using $r = 1/2$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{r}{\\|A^{-1}\\|_{op}} = \\frac{1/2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}}{14}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}} = \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}} $$\nThis is the required rigorous lower bound, expressed in exact closed form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{29}}}}$$", "id": "3057908"}]}
