This analysis will proceed by first understanding the geometric and topological structure of the sets involved, and then applying the fundamental definitions of connectedness and subspace topology.\n\nThe ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with its standard topology, which is equivalent to the product topology of $\\mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology. The problem defines three circles, $C_{a}$, for $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$C_{a} \\coloneqq \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : (x-a)^{2} + y^{2} = a^{2}\\}$$\nThis equation describes a circle with center $(a,0)$ and radius $a$.\n\nLet us identify the point $p \\coloneqq (0,0)$. For any $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we can check if $p$ lies on $C_{a}$ by substituting its coordinates into the equation:\n$$(0-a)^{2} + 0^{2} = (-a)^{2} = a^{2}$$\nThis confirms that the point $p=(0,0)$ lies on all three circles $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$.\n\nNext, let us find all points of intersection between these circles. An intersection point $(x,y)$ must satisfy the equation of each circle. The equation $(x-a)^{2} + y^{2} = a^{2}$ can be expanded to $x^{2} - 2ax + a^{2} + y^{2} = a^{2}$, which simplifies to $x^{2} + y^{2} = 2ax$.\nIf a point $(x,y)$ lies on $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$, it must satisfy:\n$1.$ $x^{2} + y^{2} = 2x$\n$2.$ $x^{2} + y^{2} = 4x$\n$3.$ $x^{2} + y^{2} = 6x$\nFrom these equations, we must have $2x = 4x = 6x$. This implies $2x = 0$, so $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the first equation gives $0^{2} + y^{2} = 2(0)$, which implies $y^{2}=0$, so $y=0$. Thus, the sole point of intersection for all three circles is $p=(0,0)$. A similar argument shows that any pair of distinct circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{j}$ (for $i, j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, $i \\neq j$) also intersect only at the point $p=(0,0)$.\n\nThe space $S$ is defined as the union of these three circles: $S \\coloneqq C_{1} \\cup C_{2} \\cup C_{3}$.\nThe space of interest, $Y$, is defined as $S$ with the point $p$ removed:\n$$Y \\coloneqq S \\setminus \\{p\\} = (C_{1} \\cup C_{2} \\cup C_{3}) \\setminus \\{p\\}$$\nUsing properties of set difference, this can be written as:\n$$Y = (C_{1} \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cup (C_{2} \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cup (C_{3} \\setminus \\{p\\})$$\nLet us define $C'_{a} \\coloneqq C_{a} \\setminus \\{p\\}$ for $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Then $Y = C'_{1} \\cup C'_{2} \\cup C'_{3}$. Since the only intersection point of any pair of circles is $p$, the sets $C'_{1}$, $C'_{2}$, and $C'_{3}$ are pairwise disjoint.\n\nThe connected components of a topological space are its maximal connected subsets. These components form a partition of the space. To find the number of connected components of $Y$, we will analyze the properties of the sets $C'_{a}$.\n\nFirst, we establish that each set $C'_{a}$ is a connected space with the subspace topology inherited from $Y$ (which itself is inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$). A circle $C_{a}$ is homeomorphic to the unit circle $S^{1}$ and is therefore path-connected, which implies it is connected. The set $C'_{a} = C_{a} \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is a circle with a single point removed. Such a space is homeomorphic to an open interval, for instance $(0, 2\\pi)$. Since an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is path-connected, it is connected. Thus, $C'_{1}$, $C'_{2}$, and $C'_{3}$ are all connected sets.\n\nNow we must determine if these sets are connected to each other within the space $Y$. The connected components of $Y$ are the equivalence classes of the relation where $x \\sim y$ if there exists a connected subset of $Y$ containing both $x$ and $y$. Since $C'_{1}$, $C'_{2}$, and $C'_{3}$ are disjoint, if we can show that they are also separated in the topology of $Y$, they must be the connected components. A partition of a space into non-empty connected subsets which are also open in the space is precisely the partition into connected components. We will show that each $C'_{a}$ is both open and closed in $Y$ (clopen).\n\nLet's consider the set $C'_{1}$. To show it is closed in $Y$, we must show it can be written as the intersection of $Y$ with a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nEach circle $C_{a}$ is the zero set of a continuous function $f_{a}(x,y) = (x-a)^{2} + y^{2} - a^{2}$, so each $C_{a}$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nLet's consider the set $C_{1}$, which is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Its intersection with $Y$ is:\n$$C_{1} \\cap Y = C_{1} \\cap (S \\setminus \\{p\\}) = (C_{1} \\cap S) \\setminus \\{p\\}$$\nSince $C_{1} \\subset S$, the intersection $C_{1} \\cap S$ is simply $C_{1}$. So,\n$$C_{1} \\cap Y = C_{1} \\setminus \\{p\\} = C'_{1}$$\nBy the definition of the subspace topology, since $C_{1}$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $C'_{1}$ is a closed set in $Y$.\nThe same reasoning applies to $C'_{2}$ and $C'_{3}$. We take the closed sets $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ from $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and intersect them with $Y$:\n$$C_{2} \\cap Y = C_{2} \\setminus \\{p\\} = C'_{2}$$\n$$C_{3} \\cap Y = C_{3} \\setminus \\{p\\} = C'_{3}$$\nTherefore, $C'_{1}$, $C'_{2}$, and $C'_{3}$ are all closed sets in the topology of $Y$.\n\nNext, we show that each $C'_{a}$ is also open in $Y$. A set is open if and only if its complement is closed.\nThe complement of $C'_{1}$ in $Y$ is $Y \\setminus C'_{1}$. Since $Y = C'_{1} \\cup C'_{2} \\cup C'_{3}$ and the sets are disjoint, we have:\n$$Y \\setminus C'_{1} = C'_{2} \\cup C'_{3}$$\nWe have already shown that $C'_{2}$ and $C'_{3}$ are closed sets in $Y$. The finite union of closed sets is a closed set. Therefore, $C'_{2} \\cup C'_{3}$ is closed in $Y$.\nSince the complement of $C'_{1}$ is closed in $Y$, $C'_{1}$ must be open in $Y$.\nBy identical logic, the complement of $C'_{2}$ is $C'_{1} \\cup C'_{3}$, which is a union of two closed sets and thus closed. So $C'_{2}$ is open in $Y$.\nAnd the complement of $C'_{3}$ is $C'_{1} \\cup C'_{2}$, which is closed, so $C'_{3}$ is open in $Y$.\n\nIn summary, we have shown:\n$1.$ $Y = C'_{1} \\cup C'_{2} \\cup C'_{3}$.\n$2.$ The sets $C'_{1}$, $C'_{2}$, $C'_{3}$ are non-empty and pairwise disjoint.\n$3.$ Each set $C'_{a}$ is connected.\n$4.$ Each set $C'_{a}$ is open in $Y$.\n\nThis constitutes a partition of $Y$ into non-empty, disjoint, connected, open sets. By the definition of connected components, these sets must be the connected components of $Y$.\nThe connected components of $Y$ are $C'_{1}$, $C'_{2}$, and $C'_{3}$.\nThe number of connected components is therefore $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "3064222"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing existing spaces, topology gives us tools to construct new ones by \"gluing\" pieces together via quotient maps.

Finally, we will analyze the connectivity of the boundary.\n\n**1. The Interior of $A$ in $M$, $\\mathrm{int}_{M}(A)$**\n\nBy the definition of the quotient topology on $M$, a set $U \\subset M$ is open if and only if its preimage $q^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in $C$. We will determine if $A$ is an open set in $M$.\n\nLet us find the preimage of $A$, $q^{-1}(A) = q^{-1}(q(S))$. The equivalence relation $\\sim$ only identifies points on the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=1$ of the square $C$. The set $S = (0,1) \\times (a, 1-a)$ is a subset of the interior $(0,1) \\times (0,1)$ of $C$. For any point $(x,y) \\in S$, its equivalence class under $\\sim$ is the singleton $\\{(x,y)\\}$. Therefore, the restriction of the quotient map $q$ to $S$ is injective. This implies that $q^{-1}(q(S)) = S$.\n\nSo, we have $q^{-1}(A) = S = (0,1) \\times (a, 1-a)$. The space $C = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$ is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A set is open in $C$ if it is the intersection of an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with $C$. The set $S$ is an open rectangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and it is fully contained in $C$. Thus, $S$ is an open set in the subspace topology of $C$.\n\nSince $q^{-1}(A) = S$ is an open set in $C$, by the definition of the quotient topology, $A$ is an open set in $M$. As $A$ is an open set, its interior is itself:\n$$\n\\mathrm{int}_{M}(A) = A = q\\big( (0,1) \\times (a, 1-a) \\big).\n$$\n\n**2. The Closure of $A$ in $M$, $\\overline{A}^{M}$**\n\nA fundamental property of quotient maps states that for any subset $B \\subset M$, its closure is given by $\\overline{B}^{M} = q(\\overline{q^{-1}(B)}^C)$, where the outer closure is in $M$ and the inner closure is in $C$.\nApplying this to our set $A$, we get:\n$$\n\\overline{A}^{M} = q(\\overline{q^{-1}(A)}^C).\n$$\nAs established before, $q^{-1}(A) = S = (0,1) \\times (a, 1-a)$. We need to find the closure of $S$ in $C = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\nThe closure of an open interval $(u,v)$ in a closed interval $[p,q]$ (where $p \\le u  v \\le q$) is the closed interval $[u,v]$. In our case, the closure of $(0,1)$ in $[0,1]$ is $[0,1]$. The closure of $(a, 1-a)$ in $[0,1]$ is $[a, 1-a]$, since $0  a  1-a  1$.\nThe closure of a product of sets is the product of their closures. Therefore, the closure of $S$ in $C$ is:\n$$\n\\overline{S}^C = \\overline{(0,1) \\times (a, 1-a)}^C = \\overline{(0,1)}^{[0,1]} \\times \\overline{(a, 1-a)}^{[0,1]} = [0,1] \\times [a, 1-a].\n$$\nNow, we apply the quotient map $q$ to this closed rectangle to find the closure of $A$ in $M$:\n$$\n\\overline{A}^{M} = q\\big( [0,1] \\times [a, 1-a] \\big).\n$$\n\n**3. The Boundary of $A$ in $M$, $\\partial_{M} A$**\n\nThe boundary of a set is its closure minus its interior: $\\partial_{M} A = \\overline{A}^{M} \\setminus \\mathrm{int}_{M}(A)$.\nSubstituting the expressions we found:\n$$\n\\partial_{M} A = q\\big([0,1] \\times [a, 1-a]\\big) \\setminus q\\big((0,1) \\times (a, 1-a)\\big).\n$$\nSince $q$ is injective on the set $S=(0,1) \\times (a, 1-a)$, this difference is the image under $q$ of the set-theoretic difference of the preimages:\n$$\n\\partial_{M} A = q\\Big( \\big([0,1] \\times [a, 1-a]\\big) \\setminus \\big((0,1) \\times (a, 1-a)\\big) \\Big).\n$$\nThe set-theoretic difference is the boundary of the rectangle $[0,1] \\times [a, 1-a]$ within the plane. This consists of four line segments:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The bottom edge: $L_b = [0,1] \\times \\{a\\}$\n    \\item The top edge: $L_t = [0,1] \\times \\{1-a\\}$\n    \\item The left edge: $L_l = \\{0\\} \\times [a, 1-a]$\n    \\item The right edge: $L_r = \\{1\\} \\times [a, 1-a]$\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, $\\partial_{M} A = q(L_b \\cup L_t \\cup L_l \\cup L_r)$.\n\n**4. Path-Connected Components of $\\partial_{M} A$**\n\nWe now analyze the topological structure of $\\partial_{M} A$ by examining how the segments $L_b, L_t, L_l, L_r$ are joined under the map $q$.\n\nConsider the images of the horizontal segments, $q(L_b)$ and $q(L_t)$.\n$q(L_b)$ is a path from $q(0,a)$ to $q(1,a)$.\n$q(L_t)$ is a path from $q(0,1-a)$ to $q(1,1-a)$.\n\nNow, consider the images of the vertical segments, $q(L_l)$ and $q(L_r)$. The equivalence relation is $(0,y) \\sim (1,1-y)$.\n$q(L_l) = \\{q(0,y) \\mid y \\in [a, 1-a]\\}$.\n$q(L_r) = \\{q(1,y) \\mid y \\in [a, 1-a]\\}$. Using the identification, $q(1,y) = q(0,1-y)$. As $y$ ranges over $[a, 1-a]$, the term $1-y$ also ranges over $[1-(1-a), 1-a] = [a, 1-a]$. Thus, the set of points in $q(L_r)$ is identical to the set of points in $q(L_l)$. The \"seam\" of the Möbius strip is the single path-connected set $V = q(L_l) = q(L_r)$.\n\nLet's trace the boundary path. Start at the point $P_1 = q(0,a)$.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Traverse along $q(L_b)$ from $P_1=q(0,a)$ to its endpoint $P_2=q(1,a)$.\n    \\item At $P_2=q(1,a)$, we apply the identification: $q(1,a) = q(0, 1-a)$. This point, let's call it $P_3$, is the starting point of the path $q(L_t)$.\n    \\item We traverse along $q(L_t)$ from $P_3=q(0,1-a)$ to its endpoint $P_4=q(1,1-a)$.\n    \\item At $P_4=q(1,1-a)$, we apply the identification: $q(1,1-a) = q(0, 1-(1-a)) = q(0,a)$. This is our starting point $P_1$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThis shows that the images of the top and bottom edges, $q(L_t)$ and $q(L_b)$, join end-to-end to form a single continuous closed loop, which is homeomorphic to a circle $S^1$. Let's call this loop $\\mathcal{L} = q(L_b \\cup L_t)$. The set $\\mathcal{L}$ is path-connected.\n\nThe full boundary is $\\partial_{M} A = \\mathcal{L} \\cup V$, where $V = q(L_l)$.\nThe loop $\\mathcal{L}$ contains the points $q(0,a)$ and $q(1,a)=q(0,1-a)$.\nThe set $V = q(\\{0\\} \\times [a,1-a])$ is the image of a line segment under a continuous map, so it is path-connected. It is a path connecting the points $q(0,a)$ and $q(0,1-a)$.\nThe intersection of $\\mathcal{L}$ and $V$ is $\\{q(0,a), q(0,1-a)\\}$, which is non-empty.\nThe union of two path-connected sets that have a non-empty intersection is itself path-connected.\nTherefore, the entire boundary $\\partial_{M} A = \\mathcal{L} \\cup V$ is path-connected.\n\nGeometrically, the set $\\overline{A}^{M}$ is a smaller Möbius strip with a boundary, carved out from the larger strip $M$. The boundary of any Möbius strip is a single connected loop.

Let's start with the equivalence class of $v_0$, denoted $[v_0]$.\n    - $v_0 \\sim v_3$ (from $a_1/a_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_3 \\sim v_2$ (from $b_1/b_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_2 \\sim v_1$ (from $a_1/a_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_1 \\sim v_4$ (from $b_1/b_1^{-1}$)\n    - $v_4 \\sim v_7$ (from $a_2/a_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_7 \\sim v_6$ (from $b_2/b_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_6 \\sim v_5$ (from $a_2/a_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_5 \\sim v_8$ (from $b_2/b_2^{-1}$)\n    - $v_8 \\sim v_{11}$ (from $a_3/a_3^{-1}$)\n    - $v_{11} \\sim v_{10}$ (from $b_3/b_3^{-1}$)\n    - $v_{10} \\sim v_9$ (from $a_3/a_3^{-1}$)\n    - $v_9 \\sim v_0$ (from $b_3/b_3^{-1}$)\n    This chain of equivalences $v_0 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_7 \\sim v_6 \\sim v_5 \\sim v_8 \\sim v_{11} \\sim v_{10} \\sim v_9 \\sim v_0$ connects all $12$ vertices. Thus, all vertices of the polygon are identified to a single point in the quotient space $X$.\n    The number of vertices in $X$ is $V=1$.\n\n4.  **Euler Characteristic Calculation:**\n    We substitute the number of vertices, edges, and faces into the Euler characteristic formula:\n    $$\n    \\chi(X) = V - E + F = 1 - 6 + 1 = -4\n    $$\n\nThis result is consistent with the classification of surfaces. The boundary word of the polygon is $a_1b_1a_1^{-1}b_1^{-1}a_2b_2a_2^{-1}b_2^{-1}a_3b_3a_3^{-1}b_3^{-1}$. This corresponds to the connected sum of three tori ($T^2 \\# T^2 \\# T^2$), which is an orientable surface of genus $g=3$. The Euler characteristic for such a surface is given by $\\chi = 2 - 2g$. For $g=3$, this formula yields $\\chi = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4$, which confirms our calculation based on the cell decomposition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-4}\n$$", "id": "3064231"}]}
