The interval $[-1, 1]$ is fixed, while the interval $[x-1, x+1]$ shifts with $x$. Both intervals have length $2$.\n- If $x+1  -1$ (i.e., $x  -2$) or if $x-1  1$ (i.e., $x  2$), the intervals are disjoint. The intersection is the empty set, and its measure is $0$. Thus, $(f*g)(x) = 0$ for $|x|2$.\n- If $-2 \\le x \\le 2$, the intervals have a non-empty intersection. We consider two sub-cases:\n    1.

So, $(f*g)(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x+1)$.\n- If $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$, the intersection is $[0,1]$, which has length $1$. So, $(f*g)(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- If $1  x \\leq 2$, the intersection is $[x-1, 1]$, which has length $1-(x-1) = 2-x$.

This can be seen by repeatedly applying differentiation under the integral sign, which is always justified as all higher-order derivatives of $\\rho_{\\epsilon}(x-y)$ with respect to $x$ exist and are continuous. Since $(f*\\rho_{\\epsilon})(x)$ is differentiable for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the limit of the finite difference quotient as $h \\to 0$ exists and is equal to the derivative. Specifically for the forward difference:\n$$ \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} Q_{h}(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{(f*\\rho_{\\epsilon})(x+h)-(f*\\rho_{\\epsilon})(x)}{h} = D(f * \\rho_{\\epsilon})(x) $$\nThis relationship illustrates the smoothing effect of the convolution. The original function $f(x) = \\chi_{[0,1]}(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=0$ and $x=1$. Its classical derivative is $0$ everywhere except at these two points, where it is undefined. The limit of the difference quotient for $f(x)$ itself does not exist at $x=0$ and $x=1$. For instance, at $x=0$, the right-hand limit of the quotient is $0$, while the left-hand limit is infinite. In the theory of distributions, the derivative of $f$ is $D f = \\delta_0 - \\delta_1$, where $\\delta_a$ is the Dirac delta distribution centered at $a$. This derivative is not a function in the classical sense.\n\nThe convolution $f * \\rho_{\\epsilon}$ transforms the non-differentiable (in the classical sense) function $f$ into a $C^{\\infty}$ function. The existence of the limit of $Q_h(x)$ for all $x$ is a direct consequence of this smoothing. The derivative $D(f * \\rho_{\\epsilon})(x)$ is itself a $C^{\\infty}$ function, given by $\\rho_{\\epsilon}(x) - \\rho_{\\epsilon}(x-1)$.\nThis resulting derivative can be interpreted as a smoothed version of the distributional derivative $D f = \\delta_0 - \\delta_1$. The Gaussian mollifier $\\rho_{\\epsilon}$ is a well-known approximation to the Dirac delta distribution $\\delta_0$ in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Thus, the convolution has effectively replaced the singular delta functions at $x=0$ and $x=1$ with smooth Gaussian \"bumps\" centered at those same locations. The process of convolution with a smooth mollifier turns a function with discontinuities and a non-classical derivative into an infinitely differentiable function whose derivatives are all well-defined, smooth functions. The convergence of the finite difference quotient for the convolved function, in contrast to its failure for the original function, is a clear manifestation of this fundamental smoothing property.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\epsilon} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\epsilon^2}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\epsilon} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-1)^2}{2\\epsilon^2}\\right)} $$", "id": "3043846"}]}
