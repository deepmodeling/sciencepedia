It requires the determination of the connected components of a specific subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. No flaws are detected.\n\nLet the Euclidean space be $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with its standard topology, for an integer $n \\geq 1$. The set in question is\n$$\nX_{n} \\;=\\; \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{n} = 0 \\}.\n$$\nThe condition $x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{n} = 0$ is equivalent to stating that at least one coordinate $x_{i}$ is equal to $0$. Therefore, the set $X_{n}$ consists of all points in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for which no coordinate is zero:\n$$\nX_{n} \\;=\\; \\{ x = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \\dots, x_{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : x_{i} \\neq 0 \\text{ for every } i = 1,2,\\dots,n \\}.\n$$\n\nWe aim to find the connected components of $X_{n}$. A connected component of a topological space is a maximal connected subset. The set of connected components forms a partition of the space. We will show that $X_{n}$ is partitioned into a collection of path-connected subsets. Since path-connectedness implies connectedness, these subsets are connected. By showing they are separated from each other, we establish them as the maximal connected subsets.\n\nFor any point $x=(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}) \\in X_{n}$, each coordinate $x_{i}$ is either strictly positive or strictly negative. This allows us to associate a unique \"sign vector\" to each point in $X_{n}$. Let us define the sign function `sgn` for non-zero real numbers as\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(z) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } z  0 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } z  0 \\end{cases}.\n$$\nNow, define a map $\\sigma : X_{n} \\to \\{ -1, 1 \\}^{n}$ by\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = \\sigma(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}) = (\\text{sgn}(x_{1}), \\dots, \\text{sgn}(x_{n})).\n$$\nThis map assigns to each point in $X_{n}$ one of the possible $n$-tuples of signs. Let the set $\\{ -1, 1 \\}^{n}$ be endowed with the discrete topology, where every subset is open.\n\nWe will demonstrate that the map $\\sigma$ is continuous. A map is continuous if the preimage of every open set in the codomain is an open set in the domain. In a discrete space, every point is an open set. Thus, it suffices to show that for any sign vector $s=(s_{1}, \\dots, s_{n}) \\in \\{ -1, 1 \\}^{n}$, its preimage $\\sigma^{-1}(\\{s\\})$ is an open set in $X_{n}$.\n\nThe preimage of a sign vector $s$ is the set of all points in $X_{n}$ whose coordinates have signs matching $s$:\n$$\nC_{s} \\;=\\; \\sigma^{-1}(\\{s\\}) \\;=\\; \\{ x \\in X_{n} : \\text{sgn}(x_{i}) = s_{i} \\text{ for } i=1, \\dots, n \\}.\n$$\nThe condition $\\text{sgn}(x_{i}) = s_{i}$ is equivalent to $s_{i}x_{i}  0$. Therefore, we can write $C_{s}$ as\n$$\nC_{s} \\;=\\; \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : s_{i}x_{i}  0 \\text{ for } i=1, \\dots, n \\}.\n$$\nFor each $i$, the set $U_{i} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : s_{i}x_{i}  0 \\}$ is an open half-space in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is an open set in the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The set $C_{s}$ is the finite intersection of these open sets: $C_{s} = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} U_{i}$. The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open. Thus, each $C_{s}$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and by extension, an open subset of $X_{n}$. This confirms that the map $\\sigma$ is continuous.\n\nNow, consider any two points $a, b \\in X_{n}$ that belong to the same connected component. Let $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to X_{n}$ be a continuous path from $a$ to $b$. The composition $\\sigma \\circ \\gamma: [0, 1] \\to \\{ -1, 1 \\}^{n}$ is a continuous map from a connected space $[0, 1]$ to a discrete space $\\{ -1, 1 \\}^{n}$. The continuous image of a connected space is connected. In a discrete space, the only connected subsets are single points. Therefore, the map $\\sigma \\circ \\gamma$ must be constant. This implies $\\sigma(\\gamma(t))$ is constant for all $t \\in [0, 1]$, and in particular, $\\sigma(a) = \\sigma(b)$.\nThis shows that any connected subset of $X_{n}$ must lie entirely within one of the sets $C_{s}$. Consequently, the connected components of $X_{n}$ must be subsets of the sets $C_{s}$.\n\nNext, we show that each set $C_{s}$ is itself connected. We will prove the stronger property of path-connectedness. A set is path-connected if for any two points in the set, there exists a continuous path connecting them that is contained entirely within the set.\nLet $a = (a_{1}, \\dots, a_{n})$ and $b = (b_{1}, \\dots, b_{n})$ be two arbitrary points in a given set $C_{s}$. This means $\\text{sgn}(a_{i}) = \\text{sgn}(b_{i}) = s_{i}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\nConsider the straight-line path $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ defined by:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = a + t(b-a) = (1-t)a + tb, \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [0, 1].\n$$\nThis path is clearly continuous, with $\\gamma(0) = a$ and $\\gamma(1) = b$. We must verify that $\\gamma(t) \\in C_{s}$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe $i$-th coordinate of $\\gamma(t)$ is $\\gamma_{i}(t) = (1-t)a_{i} + tb_{i}$. To show that $\\gamma(t) \\in C_{s}$, we need to prove that $\\text{sgn}(\\gamma_{i}(t)) = s_{i}$ for all $i$. This is equivalent to showing $s_{i}\\gamma_{i}(t)  0$.\nWe have:\n$$\ns_{i}\\gamma_{i}(t) = s_{i}((1-t)a_{i} + tb_{i}) = (1-t)(s_{i}a_{i}) + t(s_{i}b_{i}).\n$$\nBy definition of $C_{s}$, we know $s_{i}a_{i}  0$ and $s_{i}b_{i}  0$. For $t \\in [0, 1]$, the coefficients $(1-t)$ and $t$ are non-negative.\nIf $t \\in (0, 1)$, then $1-t  0$ and $t  0$. Thus, $(1-t)(s_{i}a_{i})  0$ and $t(s_{i}b_{i})  0$. Their sum $s_{i}\\gamma_{i}(t)$ is strictly positive.\nIf $t=0$, $s_{i}\\gamma_{i}(0) = s_{i}a_{i}  0$.\nIf $t=1$, $s_{i}\\gamma_{i}(1) = s_{i}b_{i}  0$.\nTherefore, for all $t \\in [0, 1]$ and for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we have $\\gamma_i(t) \\neq 0$ and its sign is constantly $s_{i}$. This means the path $\\gamma(t)$ remains entirely within $C_{s}$.\nSo, each set $C_{s}$ is path-connected, which implies it is connected.\n\nThe collection of sets $\\{C_{s} : s \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{n}\\}$ forms a partition of $X_{n}$. We have shown that each $C_s$ is connected and that any connected subset of $X_n$ must be contained in one of the $C_s$. It follows that the sets $C_s$ are the maximal connected subsets of $X_n$. Therefore, the connected components of $X_{n}$ are precisely the sets $C_{s}$.\n\nThe explicit characterization of the connected components of $X_{n}$ is the set of \"open orthants\" of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the sign vectors $s=(s_1, \\dots, s_n) \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^n$. For each such $s$, the corresponding component is\n$$\nC_{s} = \\{ (x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : \\text{sgn}(x_{i}) = s_{i} \\text{ for } i=1, \\dots, n \\}.\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the number of connected components. This number is equal to the number of distinct sets $C_{s}$, which in turn is the number of possible sign vectors $s \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{n}$.\nFor each coordinate $i$ from $1$ to $n$, there are two choices for the sign $s_i$: $-1$ or $1$. Since there are $n$ coordinates, the total number of distinct sign vectors is found by the rule of product:\n$$\n\\text{Number of components} = \\underbrace{2 \\times 2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2}_{n \\text{ times}} = 2^{n}.\n$$\nFor $n=1$, $X_1 = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which has $2^1=2$ components: $(-\\infty, 0)$ and $(0, \\infty)$.\nFor $n=2$, $X_2 = \\mathbb{R}^2$ with the axes removed, which has $2^2=4$ components (the four open quadrants).\nThe general result is $2^n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^{n}}\n$$", "id": "3043631"}, {"introduction": "Moving to a more intricate example, this problem investigates the connectivity of the plane after removing a hyperbola [@problem_id:3043639].

This will be accomplished by partitioning the space $X$ into a collection of disjoint path-connected subsets and then demonstrating that no path can exist between any two of these distinct subsets.\n\nFirst, we establish the relevant definitions. A space $S$ is path-connected if for any two points $p_1, p_2 \\in S$, there exists a continuous map $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to S$, called a path, such that $\\gamma(0) = p_1$ and $\\gamma(1) = p_2$. A path component of $S$ is a maximal path-connected subset of $S$. The set of path components forms a partition of $S$.\n\nThe set $X$ is the entirety of the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the hyperbola $H = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy=1\\}$ removed. Let us define a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x,y) = xy$. As a polynomial in two variables, $f$ is a continuous function. The space $X$ can be characterized by the value of $f(x,y)$:\n$X = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : f(x,y) \\neq 1\\}$.\nThis condition $f(x,y) \\neq 1$ partitions $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus H$ into two disjoint sets:\n$A = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy  1\\}$\n$B = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy  1\\}$\nsuch that $X = A \\cup B$.\n\nFurthermore, the set $A$ can itself be partitioned. For any point $(x,y) \\in A$, since $xy  1$, neither $x$ nor $y$ can be zero. This means $x$ and $y$ must have the same sign. We can therefore partition $A$ into two disjoint subsets:\n$A_1 = \\{(x,y) \\in A : x  0, y  0\\} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy  1, x0\\}$\n$A_3 = \\{(x,y) \\in A : x  0, y  0\\} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy  1, x0\\}$\nThus, the space $X$ is the disjoint union of three non-empty sets: $X = A_1 \\cup A_3 \\cup B$. For example, $(2,2) \\in A_1$, $(-2,-2) \\in A_3$, and $(0,0) \\in B$.\n\nWe will now demonstrate that these three sets are the path components of $X$. This requires a two-part proof: first, that no path can connect points from different sets, and second, that each set is internally path-connected.\n\nPart 1: Separation of the sets.\nLet $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to X$ be an arbitrary continuous path in $X$. The composition $g(t) = f(\\gamma(t))$ defines a continuous real-valued function on the interval $[0,1]$ because it is a composition of continuous functions ($f$ and $\\gamma$).\n\nCase 1: No path connects $A$ (i.e., $A_1 \\cup A_3$) and $B$.\nLet $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ be a point in $A$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be a point in $B$. Suppose there exists a path $\\gamma(t)$ in $X$ from $p_1$ to $p_2$.\nThen $\\gamma(0) = p_1$ and $\\gamma(1) = p_2$.\nConsider the function $g(t) = f(\\gamma(t))$. At the endpoints, we have:\n$g(0) = f(p_1) = x_1 y_1  1$.\n$g(1) = f(p_2) = x_2 y_2  1$.\nSince $g(t)$ is a continuous function on $[0,1]$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT), there must exist some $t_0 \\in (0,1)$ such that $g(t_0) = 1$.\nThis implies $f(\\gamma(t_0)) = 1$, which means the point $\\gamma(t_0)$ lies on the hyperbola $xy=1$. However, the space $X$ is defined by removing this hyperbola. So, $\\gamma(t_0) \\notin X$. This contradicts the assumption that $\\gamma$ is a path in $X$. Therefore, no path can connect a point in $A$ to a point in $B$. This shows that $A_1$ and $B$, as well as $A_3$ and $B$, belong to different path components.\n\nCase 2: No path connects $A_1$ and $A_3$.\nLet $p_1 = (x_1, y_1) \\in A_1$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2) \\in A_3$. Suppose an intra-$A$ path $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ existed in $X$ from $p_1$ to $p_2$. The coordinate projection $\\pi_x: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $\\pi_x(x,y)=x$ is a continuous function. The composition $x(t) = \\pi_x(\\gamma(t))$ is therefore a continuous function on $[0,1]$.\nAt the endpoints, we have $x(0) = x_1  0$ (since $p_1 \\in A_1$) and $x(1) = x_2  0$ (since $p_2 \\in A_3$).\nBy the IVT, there must be some $t_0 \\in (0,1)$ such that $x(t_0) = 0$.\nAt this point $\\gamma(t_0) = (0, y(t_0))$, the value of $f$ is $f(\\gamma(t_0)) = 0 \\cdot y(t_0) = 0$.\nSince $0  1$, the point $\\gamma(t_0)$ belongs to the set $B$, not $A$. This contradicts the hypothesis that the path lies within $A$. Therefore, no path connects a point in $A_1$ to a point in $A_3$.\n\nPart 1 shows that any path component of $X$ must be contained entirely within one of the sets $A_1$, $A_3$, or $B$.\n\nPart 2: Path-connectedness of each set.\nWe must now show that each of these sets is itself path-connected.\n\nPath-connectedness of $B = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy  1\\}$.\nLet $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be two arbitrary points in $B$. The origin $O=(0,0)$ is in $B$ since $0 \\cdot 0 = 0  1$. We can construct a path from $p_1$ to $p_2$ by passing through the origin.\nConsider the path from an arbitrary point $p=(x,y) \\in B$ to the origin: $\\gamma_p(t) = (1-t)p = ((1-t)x, (1-t)y)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. The product of coordinates is $f(\\gamma_p(t)) = ((1-t)x)((1-t)y) = (1-t)^2 xy$.\nSince $xy  1$, we have $(1-t)^2 xy \\le xy  1$ if $xy \\ge 0$, and $(1-t)^2 xy \\le 0  1$ if $xy  0$. In all cases, $f(\\gamma_p(t))  1$ for all $t \\in [0,1)$. At $t=1$, the point is the origin which is in $B$. Thus, the path $\\gamma_p$ lies entirely in $B$.\nTo connect $p_1$ to $p_2$, we concatenate the path from $p_1$ to $O$ with the path from $O$ to $p_2$. A formal construction is the path $\\gamma(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n(1-2t)p_1  \\text{for } t \\in [0, 1/2] \\\\\n(2t-1)p_2  \\text{for } t \\in (1/2, 1]\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis path is continuous and, by the argument above, remains entirely within $B$. Thus, $B$ is path-connected.\n\nPath-connectedness of $A_1 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy  1, x0\\}$.\nLet $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be two points in $A_1$. Then $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ are all positive, and $x_1 y_1  1$, $x_2 y_2  1$.\nConsider the logarithmic transformation $(u,v) = (\\ln x, \\ln y)$, which is a bijection from the first quadrant $\\{(x,y): x0, y0\\}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The condition $xy1$ becomes $e^u e^v  1$, which simplifies to $u+v  0$. The set of points $(u,v)$ where $u+v0$ is an open half-plane, which is a convex set.\nLet $q_1 = (\\ln x_1, \\ln y_1)$ and $q_2 = (\\ln x_2, \\ln y_2)$. Since $x_1 y_1  1$ and $x_2 y_2  1$, we have $\\ln x_1 + \\ln y_1  0$ and $\\ln x_2 + \\ln y_2  0$.\nThe straight-line path in the $(u,v)$-plane from $q_1$ to $q_2$ is $\\delta(t) = (1-t)q_1 + tq_2 = (u(t), v(t))$. For any $t \\in [0,1]$, $u(t)+v(t) = (1-t)(\\ln x_1 + \\ln y_1) + t(\\ln x_2 + \\ln y_2)  0$.\nNow, map this path back to the $(x,y)$-plane using the exponential function: $\\gamma(t) = (e^{u(t)}, e^{v(t)})$. This is a continuous path from $p_1$ to $p_2$.\nFor any $t \\in [0,1]$, the coordinates of $\\gamma(t)$ are positive. Their product is $e^{u(t)}e^{v(t)} = e^{u(t)+v(t)}$. Since $u(t)+v(t)0$, this product is greater than $e^0=1$.\nThus, the path $\\gamma(t)$ lies entirely within $A_1$. So, $A_1$ is path-connected.\n\nPath-connectedness of $A_3 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy  1, x0\\}$.\nLet $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be two points in $A_3$. Then $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ are all negative, $x_1 y_1  1$, and $x_2 y_2  1$.\nThe argument is symmetric to that for $A_1$. The map $T(x,y) = (-x, -y)$ is a homeomorphism from $A_3$ to $A_1$. Since $A_1$ is path-connected and path-connectedness is a topological invariant, $A_3$ must also be path-connected.\nExplicitly, let $q_1 = (\\ln(-x_1), \\ln(-y_1))$ and $q_2 = (\\ln(-x_2), \\ln(-y_2))$. A linear path $\\delta(t) = (u(t), v(t))$ between them in the $(u,v)$-plane satisfies $u(t)+v(t)0$. The corresponding path in $A_3$ is $\\gamma(t) = (-e^{u(t)}, -e^{v(t)})$. This path is continuous, connects $p_1$ to $p_2$, and for any $t \\in [0,1]$, its coordinates are negative and their product is $e^{u(t)+v(t)}  1$. Thus, the path lies entirely within $A_3$. So, $A_3$ is path-connected.\n\nConclusion:\nThe space $X$ has been partitioned into three non-empty, disjoint subsets: $A_1$, $A_3$, and $B$. We have shown that each of these subsets is path-connected, and that no path in $X$ can connect points from any two different subsets. Therefore, $A_1$, $A_3$, and $B$ are precisely the path components of $X$.

We will first characterize the set $S$ and then prove its connectedness. The number of connected components of a connected space is $1$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the set $S = \\overline{G}$. The closure of a set $G$ is the union of $G$ and its limit points. The set $G$ is given by $G=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : x\\neq 0 \\text{ and } y=\\sin(1/x)\\}$.

Since $V \\subset S = U \\cup W$, and $V$ is connected, $V$ must be entirely contained in one of the sets, either $U$ or $W$. Without loss of generality, let us assume $V \\subset U$.\n\nSince $U$ is open in $S$, there exists an open set $\\mathcal{O}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $U = S \\cap \\mathcal{O}$. We have $V \\subset \\mathcal{O}$. The set $V$ is compact, and the set $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\mathcal{O}$ is closed and disjoint from $V$. Therefore, the distance between these two sets is positive, i.e., $d(V, \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\mathcal{O}) = \\delta  0$.\nThis implies that any point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ within a distance $\\delta$ of $V$ must lie in $\\mathcal{O}$.\nLet $p=(x, \\sin(1/x))$ be a point in $G$. The distance from $p$ to $V$ is $d(p, V) \\le d(p, (0, \\sin(1/x))) = \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$.\nIf we choose $\\epsilon = \\delta$, then for any point $p=(x, \\sin(1/x)) \\in G$ with $|x|  \\epsilon$, we have $d(p,V)  \\epsilon = \\delta$. This means $p \\in \\mathcal{O}$. Since $p$ is also in $S$, we have $p \\in S \\cap \\mathcalO = U$.\nSo, all points in $S$ satisfying $|x|\\epsilon$ must belong to $U$.\n\nNow consider the set $G_+ = \\{(x, \\sin(1/x)) : x  0\\}$. The set $(0, \\infty)$ is a connected interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. The map $f: (0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $f(x) = (x, \\sin(1/x))$ is continuous. The image of a connected set under a continuous map is connected. Therefore, $G_+$ is a connected subset of $S$.\n\nBy our initial assumption, $W$ is non-empty. Let $q = (x_q, y_q)$ be a point in $W$. Since $V \\subset U$ and $U \\cap W = \\emptyset$, $q$ cannot be in $V$. Thus, $x_q \\neq 0$.\nAlso, all points of $S$ with $|x|\\epsilon$ are in $U$, so it must be that $|x_q| \\ge \\epsilon$.\nLet's assume, without loss of generality, that $x_q  0$. This means $q \\in G_+$. So $G_+ \\cap W$ is non-empty.\nHowever, we can also find points in $G_+$ that are in $U$. For example, choose an $x_u$ such that $0  x_u  \\epsilon$. The point $u = (x_u, \\sin(1/x_u))$ is in $G_+$ and, because $|x_u|\\epsilon$, it is also in $U$. So $G_+ \\cap U$ is non-empty.\nThe sets $G_+ \\cap U$ and $G_+ \\cap W$ are non-empty, disjoint, and their union is $G_+$. They are open in the subspace topology of $G_+$. This constitutes a separation of $G_+$. But this contradicts the fact that $G_+$ is a connected set.\n\nOur initial assumption that $S$ is not connected must be false. Therefore, $S$ is a connected space.\nA connected space has exactly one connected component, namely the space itself.\nThe number of connected components of $S$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3043632"}]}
