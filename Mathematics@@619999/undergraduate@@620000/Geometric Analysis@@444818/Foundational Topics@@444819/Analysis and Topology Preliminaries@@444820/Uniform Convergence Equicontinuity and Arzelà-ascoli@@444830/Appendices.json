All terms are clearly defined, and the premises are mathematically sound.\n\nWe are given the sequence of functions $\\{f_{n}\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ defined on the compact interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ by $f_{n}(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)$.\n\n### Part 1: Equicontinuity\n\nA family of functions $\\mathcal{F} = \\{f_n\\}$ defined on a metric space $(X, d)$ is said to be equicontinuous on $X$ if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all functions $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and for all $x, y \\in X$ with $d(x, y) < \\delta$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < \\epsilon$. Since the domain $[0, 2\\pi]$ is compact, this is equivalent to uniform equicontinuity.\n\nLet's examine the expression $|f_{n}(x) - f_{n}(y)|$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $x, y \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n$$ |f_{n}(x) - f_{n}(y)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx) - \\frac{1}{n}\\sin(ny)\\right| = \\frac{1}{n}|\\sin(nx) - \\sin(ny)| $$\nTo bound this expression, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to the function $g(u) = \\sin(u)$. For any two points $a$ and $b$, there exists a point $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that $|\\sin(b) - \\sin(a)| = |\\cos(c)(b-a)|$. Since $|\\cos(c)| \\le 1$ for all real $c$, we have the general inequality $|\\sin(b) - \\sin(a)| \\le |b-a|$.\n\nApplying this inequality with $b=nx$ and $a=ny$, we obtain:\n$$ |\\sin(nx) - \\sin(ny)| \\le |nx - ny| = n|x - y| $$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $|f_{n}(x) - f_{n}(y)|$:\n$$ |f_{n}(x) - f_{n}(y)| \\le \\frac{1}{n} (n|x-y|) = |x-y| $$\nThis inequality holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and for all $x, y \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nNow, to prove equicontinuity from first principles, let an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. We must find a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and all $x, y \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, if $|x-y| < \\delta$, then $|f_{n}(x) - f_{n}(y)| < \\epsilon$.\nBased on the inequality derived above, $|f_{n}(x) - f_{n}(y)| \\le |x-y|$, we can simply choose $\\delta = \\epsilon$.\nThen, if $|x-y| < \\delta$, it follows immediately that:\n$$ |f_{n}(x) - f_{n}(y)| \\le |x-y| < \\delta = \\epsilon $$\nSince the choice of $\\delta$ depends only on $\\epsilon$ and not on $n$ or the specific points $x, y$, the family $\\{f_n\\}$ is uniformly equicontinuous, and therefore equicontinuous, on $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\n### Part 2: Uniform Convergence\n\nFirst, we determine the pointwise limit of the sequence. For any fixed $x \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, we have:\n$$ |f_{n}(x)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)\\right| \\le \\frac{1}{n} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. By the Squeeze Theorem, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_{n}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The pointwise limit function is the zero function, $f(x) = 0$.\n\nFor uniform convergence, we must determine if $\\|f_n - f\\|_{\\infty} \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Here, $f(x)=0$, so we examine $\\|f_n\\|_{\\infty}$.\n$$ \\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x\\in[0,2\\pi]}|f_{n}(x)| = \\sup_{x\\in[0,2\\pi]}\\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)\\right| = \\frac{1}{n}\\sup_{x\\in[0,2\\pi]}|\\sin(nx)| $$\nThe supremum of $|\\sin(u)|$ is $1$. For any $n \\ge 1$, this value is attained within the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$. For example, if we choose $x_{n} = \\frac{\\pi}{2n}$, then $x_n \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ for $n \\ge 1/4$, which is true for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. At this point, $\\sin(nx_n) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\sup_{x\\in[0,2\\pi]}|\\sin(nx)| = 1$.\nThis gives $\\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{n}$.\nSince $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0$, the sequence $\\{f_{n}\\}$ converges uniformly to the zero function $f(x)=0$ on $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nAlternatively, using the Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem (AAT):\n1.  The domain $[0, 2\\pi]$ is compact.\n2.  The family $\\{f_n\\}$ is uniformly bounded, since $|f_n(x)| = |\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)| \\le \\frac{1}{n} \\le 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$ and all $x \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n3.  The family $\\{f_n\\}$ is equicontinuous, as demonstrated in Part 1.\n\nBy the AAT, the family $\\{f_n\\}$ is relatively compact in the space of continuous functions $C([0, 2\\pi])$ with the uniform norm. This means every subsequence of $\\{f_n\\}$ has a further subsequence that converges uniformly.\nWe know that the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ converges pointwise to the zero function $f(x)=0$. If a subsequence $\\{f_{n_k}\\}$ converges uniformly, its limit must coincide with the pointwise limit. Thus, any uniformly convergent subsequence must converge to $f(x)=0$.\nSince the set $\\{f_n\\}$ is relatively compact and has only one possible limit point (the zero function), the entire sequence must converge to that limit. Therefore, $\\{f_n\\}$ converges uniformly to $f(x)=0$.\n\n### Part 3: Computation of Quantities\n\n1.  **Uniform norm $\\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty}$**:\n    As determined in Part 2,\n    $$ \\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x\\in[0,2\\pi]} \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)\\right| = \\frac{1}{n} $$\n    The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0$.\n\n2.  **Integral $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)\\,dx$**:\n    We compute the definite integral directly:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)\\,dx = \\frac{1}{n} \\left[-\\frac{1}{n}\\cos(nx)\\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} $$\n    $$ = -\\frac{1}{n^2} [\\cos(n(2\\pi)) - \\cos(n \\cdot 0)] = -\\frac{1}{n^2} [\\cos(2n\\pi) - \\cos(0)] $$\n    Since $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\cos(2n\\pi)=1$. Also, $\\cos(0)=1$.\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)\\,dx = -\\frac{1}{n^2} [1 - 1] = 0 $$\n    The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 0 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Integral $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)^{2}\\,dx$**:\n    We compute the integral of the squared function:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)^{2}\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)\\right)^2\\,dx = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(nx)\\,dx $$\n    We use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$.\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)^{2}\\,dx = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - \\cos(2nx)}{2}\\,dx = \\frac{1}{2n^2} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 1\\,dx - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(2nx)\\,dx \\right] $$\n    $$ = \\frac{1}{2n^2} \\left[ [x]_{0}^{2\\pi} - \\left[\\frac{1}{2n}\\sin(2nx)\\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} \\right] $$\n    $$ = \\frac{1}{2n^2} \\left[ (2\\pi - 0) - \\left( \\frac{\\sin(2n(2\\pi))}{2n} - \\frac{\\sin(2n \\cdot 0)}{2n} \\right) \\right] $$\n    Since $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\sin(4n\\pi) = 0$ and $\\sin(0) = 0$.\n    $$ = \\frac{1}{2n^2} [2\\pi - (0-0)] = \\frac{2\\pi}{2n^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{n^2} $$\n    The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\pi}{n^2} = 0$.\n\nThe expressions requested are $\\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{n}$, $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)\\,dx = 0$, and $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f_{n}(x)^{2}\\,dx = \\frac{\\pi}{n^2}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{n} & 0 & \\frac{\\pi}{n^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "3077496"}, {"introduction": "Theory is often best understood through counterexamples.

Continuity of $f_n$**\nFor any fixed $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the function $g(x) = nx$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, and the constant function $h(x) = 1$ is also continuous on $[0,1]$. The function $f_n(x)$ is the minimum of these two continuous functions, $f_n(x) = \\min(g(x), h(x))$. The minimum of two continuous functions is itself continuous.\nExplicitly, the function can be written as:\n$$\nf_n(x) = \\begin{cases}\nnx & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1/n \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } 1/n < x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt the point $x=1/n$, the left-hand limit is $\\lim_{x \\to (1/n)^-} nx = n(1/n) = 1$. The right-hand limit is $\\lim_{x \\to (1/n)^+} 1 = 1$. The function value is $f_n(1/n) = \\min(1, n(1/n)) = 1$. Since the limits and function value agree, $f_n$ is continuous at $x=1/n$. It is clearly continuous for $x \\in [0, 1/n)$ and $x \\in (1/n, 1]$. Therefore, each function $f_n$ is continuous on $[0,1]$.\n\n**2. Pointwise Convergence**\nWe determine the pointwise limit $f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x)$ for each $x \\in [0,1]$.\n*   If $x=0$, then $f_n(0) = \\min(1, n \\cdot 0) = \\min(1,0) = 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Thus, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(0) = 0$.\n*   If $x \\in (0,1]$, we can find an integer $N$ such that $N > 1/x$. For all $n \\ge N$, we have $nx \\ge Nx > 1$. For these values of $n$, $f_n(x) = \\min(1, nx) = 1$. Therefore, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = 1$.\n\nThe pointwise limit function is:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } x=0 \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } x \\in (0,1]\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe limit function $f$ is discontinuous at $x=0$ because $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = 1$, which is not equal to $f(0)=0$.\n\n**3. Uniform Convergence**\nA fundamental theorem of analysis states that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. In our case, each $f_n$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, but their pointwise limit $f$ is discontinuous on $[0,1]$. Therefore, the convergence cannot be uniform on $[0,1]$. This applies not only to the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ itself but to any subsequence $\\{f_{n_k}\\}$, as any subsequence must also converge pointwise to the same discontinuous limit $f$.\n\n**4. Equicontinuity**\nA family of functions $\\{f_n\\}$ is equicontinuous on $[0,1]$ if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and for all $x,y \\in [0,1]$ with $|x-y| < \\delta$, we have $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| < \\epsilon$.\nLet's test for equicontinuity at the point $x_0 = 0$. We need to show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $n$, if $|x-0| < \\delta$, then $|f_n(x) - f_n(0)| < \\epsilon$.\nWe know $f_n(0) = 0$ for all $n$. So we need $|f_n(x)| < \\epsilon$.\nLet's choose $\\epsilon = 1/2$. We must find a $\\delta > 0$ that works for all $n$.\nFor any proposed $\\delta > 0$, we can choose an integer $n_0$ large enough such that $1/n_0 < \\delta$. Let's consider this specific $n_0$ and the point $x = 1/n_0$. This point satisfies $|x-0| = 1/n_0 < \\delta$.\nHowever, the value of the function at this point is $f_{n_0}(1/n_0) = \\min(1, n_0 \\cdot (1/n_0)) = \\min(1,1) = 1$.\nSo, we have $|f_{n_0}(1/n_0) - f_{n_0}(0)| = |1-0| = 1$, which is not less than our chosen $\\epsilon=1/2$.\nSince we can find such a function for any $\\delta > 0$, no single $\\delta$ works for all $n$. Thus, the family $\\{f_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is not equicontinuous at $x=0$, and therefore is not equicontinuous on $[0,1]$.\n\n**5. Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem**\nThe Arzelà-Ascoli theorem states that a subset of $C(K)$ (the space of continuous functions on a compact metric space $K\n$) is relatively compact if and only if it is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. A sequence having a uniformly convergent subsequence is equivalent to the set of its functions being relatively compact.\n*   **Pointwise Boundedness**: For any $x \\in [0,1]$ and any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $0 \\le f_n(x) = \\min(1, nx) \\le 1$. Thus, the sequence is uniformly bounded, which implies it is pointwise bounded.\n*   **Equicontinuity**: As shown above, this condition fails.\nSince the family $\\{f_n\\}$ is not equicontinuous, the hypotheses of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem are not met. The \"if and only if\" nature of the theorem allows us to conclude that the set $\\{f_n\\}$ is not relatively compact, and therefore no subsequence of $\\{f_n\\}$ can converge uniformly on $[0,1]$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The functions $f_n$ are continuous on $[0,1]$ and converge pointwise to the function $f$ given by $f(0) = 0$ and $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in (0,1]$, and this limit $f$ is discontinuous at $x = 0$.**\nOur analysis in points 1 and 2 confirms every part of this statement. Each $f_n$ is continuous. The pointwise limit $f(x)$ is exactly as described. The limit function $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=0$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. There exists a subsequence $\\{f_{n_k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ that converges uniformly on $[0,1]$ to the pointwise limit $f$.**\nThe functions $f_{n_k}$ are all continuous. If they were to converge uniformly, their limit must be continuous. However, their pointwise limit (which must be the same as the uniform limit) is the function $f$, which is discontinuous. This is a contradiction. Therefore, no such subsequence can exist.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The family $\\{f_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is equicontinuous on $[0,1]$.**\nOur analysis in point 4 demonstrated that the family is not equicontinuous at $x=0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Any uniformly convergent subsequence $\\{f_{n_k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ would have a continuous limit on $[0,1]$, which contradicts the discontinuity of the pointwise limit $f$; therefore, no uniformly convergent subsequence exists.**\nThis statement presents a logical argument. The first part, \"Any uniformly convergent subsequence ... would have a continuous limit,\" is a statement of the uniform limit theorem. The second part, \"...which contradicts the discontinuity of the pointwise limit $f$,\" correctly identifies that the limit must be the pointwise limit $f$, which is discontinuous. The conclusion, \"...therefore, no uniformly convergent subsequence exists,\" follows logically from this contradiction. The entire statement constitutes a valid proof.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Because equicontinuity fails for $\\{f_n\\}$, the hypotheses of the Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem are not satisfied on $[0,1]$; consequently, the theorem cannot be used to deduce the existence of a uniformly convergent subsequence of $\\{f_n\\}$.**\nOur analysis in points 4 and 5 confirms this. The family $\\{f_n\\}$ is not equicontinuous. Equicontinuity is a necessary hypothesis for the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem to guarantee a uniformly convergent subsequence. Since the hypothesis is not met, the theorem cannot be invoked to conclude that such a subsequence exists. The statement is a correct assessment of the applicability of the theorem in this scenario.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nFinal summary: Statements A, D, and E are true.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "3077480"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding, this final practice explores a more nuanced scenario involving the interplay between uniform convergence and differentiation.

It is a composition of smooth functions, so it is smooth.\nUsing the chain rule, we compute the derivative $f_n'(x)$:\n$$\nf_n'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (x^2 + n^{-1})^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + n^{-1})^{-1/2} (2x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}}}.\n$$\nNow, we verify the pointwise limit of $f_n'(x)$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n-   For $x \\neq 0$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n'(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}}} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 0}} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2}} = \\frac{x}{|x|}.\n    $$\n    This limit is $1$ if $x > 0$ and $-1$ if $x < 0$. This matches the definition of $g(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ for $x \\neq 0$.\n-   For $x = 0$:\n    $$\n    f_n'(0) = \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{0^2 + n^{-1}}} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } n \\in \\mathbb{N}.\n    $$\n    Thus, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n'(0) = 0$, which matches $g(0) = 0$.\nThe claim that $f_n'(x) \\to g(x)$ pointwise on $[-1,1]$ is correct. The problem statement is coherent, scientifically grounded in mathematics, and complete.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution by analyzing each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The sequence $(f_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges uniformly to $|x|$ on $[-1,1]$, and in fact**\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} \\bigl| f_n(x) - |x| \\bigr| \\;=\\; n^{-1/2}.\n$$\nFirst, we find the pointwise limit of $f_n(x)$ as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 0} = \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|.\n$$\nThe pointwise limit function is $f(x) = |x|$. To check for uniform convergence, we must analyze the supremum of the absolute difference:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} |f_n(x) - f(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} \\left| \\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}} - |x| \\right|.\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}} \\ge \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$, the absolute value is redundant. Let $h_n(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}} - |x|$. Since $h_n(x) = h_n(-x)$, we can analyze the function on $[0,1]$. For $x \\in [0,1]$, we have $|x|=x$, so $h_n(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}} - x$. To find the supremum, we check the derivative with respect to $x$ for $x > 0$:\n$$\nh_n'(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}}} - 1.\n$$\nSince $x^2 + n^{-1} > x^2$, we have $\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}} > x$, which implies $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}}} < 1$. Thus, $h_n'(x) < 0$ for $x \\in (0,1]$. This means $h_n(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function on $[0,1]$. The supremum must therefore be at $x=0$.\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} h_n(x) = h_n(0) = \\sqrt{0^2 + n^{-1}} - 0 = \\sqrt{n^{-1}} = n^{-1/2}.\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{-1/2} = 0$, the sequence $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to $|x|$ on $[-1,1]$. The statement provides the correct value for the supremum.\n\nConclusion: Statement **A** is **Correct**.\n\n**B. The derivatives $(f_n')_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converge uniformly on $[-1,1]$ to the derivative of $|x|$, interpreted as $g$.**\nFor a sequence of functions to converge uniformly, a necessary condition is that the limit function must be continuous if the functions in the sequence are continuous. Each function $f_n'(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}}}$ is a continuous function on $[-1,1]$. The pointwise limit function is $g(x)$. The function $g(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=0$, since $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} g(x) = 1$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} g(x) = -1$, while $g(0) = 0$. Because the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions must be continuous, and $g(x)$ is not continuous, the convergence $f_n' \\to g$ cannot be uniform on any interval containing $0$, including $[-1,1]$.\n\nConclusion: Statement **B** is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The family $\\{ f_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ is equicontinuous and uniformly bounded on $[-1,1]$. Therefore, by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, there exists a subsequence that converges uniformly to a continuous function on $[-1,1]$. Because $f_n(x) \\to |x|$ for each $x \\in [-1,1]$, the only possible uniform limit is $|x|$, and hence, in fact, $f_n \\to |x|$ uniformly on $[-1,1]$.**\nThis statement presents a chain of reasoning that we must verify step by step.\n1.  **Uniform Boundedness:** For $x \\in [-1,1]$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ($n \\ge 1$), we have $x^2 \\in [0,1]$ and $n^{-1} \\in (0,1]$.\n    $$\n    |f_n(x)| = \\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}} \\le \\sqrt{1^2 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}.\n    $$\n    The family $\\{f_n\\}$ is uniformly bounded on $[-1,1]$ by $M=\\sqrt{2}$.\n2.  **Equicontinuity:** A family of differentiable functions is equicontinuous if their derivatives are uniformly bounded. We calculate $|f_n'(x)|$:\n    $$\n    |f_n'(x)| = \\left| \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}}} \\right| = \\frac{|x|}{\\sqrt{x^2 + n^{-1}}} \\le \\frac{|x|}{\\sqrt{x^2}} = 1\n    $$\n    for $x \\neq 0$. For $x=0$, $f_n'(0)=0$. Thus, $|f_n'(x)| \\le 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and all $x \\in [-1,1]$. By the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x, y \\in [-1,1]$, there exists $c$ between $x$ and $y$ such that\n    $$\n    |f_n(x) - f_n(y)| = |f_n'(c)| |x-y| \\le 1 \\cdot |x-y|.\n    $$\n    Given $\\epsilon > 0$, choosing $\\delta = \\epsilon$ ensures that for all $n$, if $|x-y|<\\delta$, then $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| < \\epsilon$. The family $\\{f_n\\}$ is equicontinuous.\n3.  **Arzelà-Ascoli Application and Conclusion:** Since $\\{f_n\\}$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on the compact set $[-1,1]$, the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem states it is relatively compact in $C([-1,1])$. This means every subsequence of $(f_n)$ has a further subsequence that converges uniformly. Since we know $(f_n)$ converges pointwise to $|x|$, any uniformly convergent subsequence must converge to this same limit. The function $f(x)=|x|$ is continuous. The argument that if every subsequence has a further subsequence converging to the same limit $|x|$, then the entire sequence must converge to $|x|$ is a standard result in metric spaces. The reasoning is sound and provides a correct, alternative proof for the uniform convergence of $(f_n)$.\n\nConclusion: Statement **C** is **Correct**.\n\n**D. The family $\\{ f_n' : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ is equicontinuous on $[-1,1]$ and relatively compact in $C([-1,1])$.**\nBy the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, for a family of functions on a compact set, relative compactness in the space of continuous functions is equivalent to being uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. Let's check these properties for $\\{f_n'\\}$.\n1.  **Uniform Boundedness:** As shown for C, $|f_n'(x)| \\le 1$ for all $n$ and $x$. The family is uniformly bounded.\n2.  **Equicontinuity:** We investigate the derivatives of $f_n'$, i.e., $f_n''(x)$.\n    $$\n    f_n''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x(x^2 + n^{-1})^{-1/2} \\right) = (x^2+n^{-1})^{-1/2} - x^2(x^2+n^{-1})^{-3/2} = \\frac{n^{-1}}{(x^2+n^{-1})^{3/2}}.\n    $$\n    A sufficient condition for equicontinuity is the uniform boundedness of the derivatives $\\{f_n''\\}$. Let's check the maximum value of $|f_n''(x)|$:\n    $$\n    \\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} |f_n''(x)| = |f_n''(0)| = \\frac{n^{-1}}{(0+n^{-1})^{3/2}} = \\frac{n^{-1}}{n^{-3/2}} = n^{1/2}.\n    $$\n    Since $\\sup_{n} n^{1/2} = \\infty$, the family $\\{f_n''\\}$ is not uniformly bounded. This suggests $\\{f_n'\\}$ is not equicontinuous. To prove this directly, we must show the definition fails. Let $\\epsilon > 0$. We need to find $x, y$ arbitrarily close such that $|f_n'(x) - f_n'(y)| \\ge \\epsilon$ for some $n$.\n    Consider $y=0$ and $x_n = n^{-1/2}$. For any $\\delta > 0$, we can choose $n$ large enough so that $|x_n - 0| = n^{-1/2} < \\delta$. Now, we check the difference in function values:\n    $$\n    |f_n'(x_n) - f_n'(0)| = \\left| \\frac{x_n}{\\sqrt{x_n^2 + n^{-1}}} - 0 \\right| = \\frac{n^{-1/2}}{\\sqrt{(n^{-1/2})^2 + n^{-1}}} = \\frac{n^{-1/2}}{\\sqrt{n^{-1}+n^{-1}}} = \\frac{n^{-1/2}}{\\sqrt{2}n^{-1/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n    $$\n    If we choose $\\epsilon = 1/2$, then for any $\\delta > 0$, we can find $n$ and points $x_n, 0$ with $|x_n-0|<\\delta$ such that $|f_n'(x_n)-f_n'(0)|=1/\\sqrt{2} > 1/2$. Therefore, the family $\\{f_n'\\}$ is not equicontinuous on $[-1,1]$. Since it is not equicontinuous, it is not relatively compact in $C([-1,1])$.\n\nConclusion: Statement **D** is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If $x_n = n^{-1/2}$, then $\\bigl| f_n'(x_n) - g(x_n) \\bigr| = 1 - 2^{-1/2}$, so $\\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} \\bigl| f_n'(x) - g(x) \\bigr| \\ge 1 - 2^{-1/2}$ for every $n$, which implies that the derivatives do not converge uniformly on $[-1,1]$; the failure is concentrated near $x = 0$ where the limit $g$ is discontinuous.**\nThis statement gives a specific calculation to demonstrate the lack of uniform convergence of $(f_n')$.\n1.  Let $x_n = n^{-1/2}$. Since $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $x_n > 0$.\n2.  Value of $f_n'(x_n)$: As computed in the analysis of D, $f_n'(x_n) = 1/\\sqrt{2} = 2^{-1/2}$.\n3.  Value of $g(x_n)$: Since $x_n > 0$, $g(x_n) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x_n) = 1$.\n4.  The difference: $|f_n'(x_n) - g(x_n)| = |2^{-1/2} - 1| = 1 - 2^{-1/2}$, since $1 > 2^{-1/2}$. The calculation is correct.\n5.  Supremum bound: The supremum of a function over a set is always greater than or equal to its value at any point in the set.\n    $$\n    \\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} |f_n'(x) - g(x)| \\ge |f_n'(x_n) - g(x_n)| = 1 - 2^{-1/2}.\n    $$\n    This inequality holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n6.  Implication for Uniform Convergence: For $(f_n')$ to converge uniformly to $g$, the supremum norm of the difference must tend to $0$: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} |f_n'(x) - g(x)| = 0$. However, we have shown this supremum is bounded below by the positive constant $1 - 2^{-1/2} \\approx 0.293$. Therefore, the limit cannot be $0$, and the convergence is not uniform.\n7.  Interpretation: The points $x_n = n^{-1/2}$ approach $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The analysis shows that for any $n$, there is a point $x_n$ (which gets closer to $0$ as $n$ grows) where the difference $|f_n'(x_n) - g(x_n)|$ remains fixed at a non-zero value. This correctly identifies that the failure of uniform convergence is related to the discontinuity of $g$ at $x=0$. The entire statement is a correct and insightful analysis.\n\nConclusion: Statement **E** is **Correct**.\n\nFinal Summary of Correct Statements: A, C, E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3077510"}]}
