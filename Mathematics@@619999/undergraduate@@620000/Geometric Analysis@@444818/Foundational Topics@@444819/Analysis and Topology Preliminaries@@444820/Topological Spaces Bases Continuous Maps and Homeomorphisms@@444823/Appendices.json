We assume the standard definition of the set of natural numbers, $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\n\nFirst, we restate the provided definitions. The standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ is generated by the basis $\\mathcal{B}$ consisting of all open intervals $(a,b)$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$. The derived set $A'$ of a subset $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that for every basis neighborhood $U \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $x \\in U$, the intersection $(U \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cap A$ is non-empty. Such a point $x$ is called a limit point or accumulation point of $A$.\n\nOur task is to determine which points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are limit points of the set $A = \\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\ldots\\}$. We will analyze all possible cases for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nCase 1: $x = 0$.\nWe must determine if $0$ is a limit point of $A$. Let $U$ be an arbitrary basis neighborhood of $0$. By definition of the basis $\\mathcal{B}$, $U = (a, b)$ for some real numbers $a, b$ satisfying $a < 0 < b$. To show that $0 \\in A'$, we must demonstrate that $(U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap A \\neq \\varnothing$.\nThe set $U \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is $(a, 0) \\cup (0, b)$. The set $A$ consists of only positive numbers. Therefore, we need to show that $(0, b) \\cap A \\neq \\varnothing$.\nSince $b > 0$, by the Archimedean property of the real numbers, there exists a natural number $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $N > 1/b$. Because $N$ is a natural number and $b$ is positive, $N$ is positive. Thus, we can take the reciprocal of the inequality and reverse the inequality sign, which gives $1/N < b$.\nSince $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $N \\ge 1$, which implies $1/N \\le 1$. Also, $1/N$ is strictly positive. So, we have found a point $y = 1/N$ such that $y \\in A$ and $0 < y < b$.\nSince $y = 1/N$ and $0 < y < b$, it is in the interval $(0,b)$. It is also not equal to $0$. Thus, $y \\in (U \\setminus \\{0\\})$.\nThis means $y \\in (U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap A$. Since we have found such a point for any arbitrary basis neighborhood $U$ of $0$, the condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, $0 \\in A'$.\n\nCase 2: $x \\in A$.\nLet $x$ be an element of $A$. Then $x = 1/k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We want to determine if $1/k$ is a limit point of $A$. For $1/k$ to be a limit point, every neighborhood of $1/k$ must contain another point from $A$. We can test this by constructing a specific neighborhood that isolates $1/k$ from all other points of $A$.\nSubcase 2.1: $k = 1$. Then $x = 1$. The set $A$ is $\\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\ldots\\}$. The elements of $A$ other than $1$ are all less than or equal to $1/2$. Consider the basis neighborhood $U = (1/2, 3/2)$. Clearly, $1 \\in U$. The intersection of $U$ with $A$ is $\\{1\\}$, since all other elements of $A$ are less than or equal to $1/2$ and thus are not in $U$. Therefore, $(U \\setminus \\{1\\}) \\cap A = ( (1/2, 1) \\cup (1, 3/2) ) \\cap A = \\varnothing$. Since we found a neighborhood $U$ of $1$ for which the condition fails, $1$ is not a limit point of $A$. So, $1 \\notin A'$.\nSubcase 2.2: $k > 1$. Then $x = 1/k$. The points of $A$ \"adjacent\" to $1/k$ are $1/(k+1)$ and $1/(k-1)$. We know that for $k > 1$, $1/(k+1) < 1/k < 1/(k-1)$. Consider the basis neighborhood $U = (1/(k+1), 1/(k-1))$. This is a valid open interval containing $x = 1/k$. By its construction, this interval contains no other points from the set $A$. For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, if $n \\le k-1$, then $1/n \\ge 1/(k-1)$, so $1/n \\notin U$. If $n \\ge k+1$, then $1/n \\le 1/(k+1)$, so $1/n \\notin U$. The only element of $A$ in $U$ is $1/k$.\nThus, for this neighborhood $U$, $(U \\setminus \\{1/k\\}) \\cap A = \\varnothing$. Since we have found a neighborhood for which the condition fails, $1/k$ is not a limit point of $A$ for any $k > 1$.\nCombining subcases 2.1 and 2.2, no point in $A$ is a limit point of $A$.\n\nCase 3: $x \\notin A \\cup \\{0\\}$.\nWe analyze the remaining points in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nSubcase 3.1: $x < 0$. Let $U = (x-1, 0)$. This is a basis neighborhood of $x$. Since all elements of $A$ are positive, $A \\cap U = \\varnothing$. It follows immediately that $(U \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cap A = \\varnothing$. Thus, no negative number is a limit point of $A$.\nSubcase 3.2: $x > 1$. Let $U = (1, x+1)$. This is a basis neighborhood of $x$. The largest element of $A$ is $1$. So, $A \\cap U = \\varnothing$. Consequently, $(U \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cap A = \\varnothing$. Thus, no number greater than $1$ is a limit point of $A$.\nSubcase 3.3: $0 < x < 1$ and $x \\notin A$. Since $x \\in (0, 1)$, and the sequence $\\{1/n\\}$ converges to $0$, there must exist some natural number $N$ such that $1/N < x$. Let $ S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : 1/n < x\\}$. $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ and by the Well-Ordering Principle, it has a least element, which we denote as $N+1$. Since $N+1$ is the least element in $S$, we have $1/(N+1) < x$. By definition of $S$, the integer $N$ is not in $S$, so $1/N \\not< x$. Since we are in the case where $x \\notin A$, $x \\neq 1/N$. Therefore, we must have $1/N > x$. This gives us the inequality $1/(N+1) < x < 1/N$.\nLet us define the basis neighborhood $U = (1/(N+1), 1/N)$. This open interval contains $x$. By the same argument as in subcase 2.2, there are no elements of $A$ within this interval. Thus, $U \\cap A = \\varnothing$. It follows that $(U \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cap A = \\varnothing$. Therefore, no such $x$ is a limit point of $A$.\n\nSummary of Conclusions:\nFrom Case 1, we found that $0 \\in A'$.\nFrom Case 2, we found that for any $x \\in A$, $x \\notin A'$.\nFrom Case 3, we found that for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus (A \\cup \\{0\\})$, $x \\notin A'$.\n\nCombining all cases, the only point in $\\mathbb{R}$ that is a limit point of $A$ is the point $0$. Therefore, the derived set is the set containing only this single point.\nThe derived set is $A' = \\{0\\}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\{0\\}}$$", "id": "3076938"}, {"introduction": "A common misconception is that continuity is an intrinsic property of a function's algebraic formula.

To check for continuity, we must verify that the preimage of every open set in $(Y, \\tau_{\\mathrm{ind}})$ is an open set in $X$.\nThe open sets in $Y$ are $\\varnothing$ and $Y = \\{0,1\\}$. We compute their preimages under $f$:\n$1$. The preimage of the empty set is $f^{-1}(\\varnothing) = \\{x \\in X \\mid f(x) \\in \\varnothing\\} = \\varnothing$.

The entire space $X$ is, by definition, an open set in its own topology.\n\nSince the preimages of all open sets in $(Y, \\tau_{\\mathrm{ind}})$ are open sets in $X$, the function $f: X \\to (Y, \\tau_{\\mathrm{ind}})$ is continuous. This is a general result: any function from a topological space to a space with the indiscrete topology is continuous.\n\n**Part 2: Non-continuity of $f$ when $Y$ is equipped with the discrete topology $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}$**\n\nThe discrete topology on $Y=\\{0,1\\}$ is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\{\\varnothing, \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, Y\\}$. To show that $f$ is not continuous, we only need to find one open set in $(Y, \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}})$ whose preimage under $f$ is not open in $X$.\n\nLet's consider the open set $V_0 = \\{0\\} \\in \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}$. The preimage of this set is:\n$$\nf^{-1}(\\{0\\}) = \\{x \\in X \\mid f(x) = 0\\}\n$$\nBy the definition of $f$, this is the set of rational numbers in the interval $[0,1]$.\n$$\nf^{-1}(\\{0\\}) = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]\n$$\nNow we must determine if this set is open in $X=[0,1]$ with the subspace topology. A set $A \\subseteq X$ is open in the subspace topology if for every point $a \\in A$, there exists a real number $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open interval $(a-\\epsilon, a+\\epsilon)$ intersected with the space $X$ is contained in $A$. That is, $(a-\\epsilon, a+\\epsilon) \\cap X \\subseteq A$.\n\nLet's take any point $q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, the interval $(q-\\epsilon, q+\\epsilon)$ contains both rational and irrational numbers. This is a consequence of the density of both $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the set $(q-\\epsilon, q+\\epsilon) \\cap [0,1]$ will always contain irrational numbers.\nSince any neighborhood of $q$ in $X$ contains points not in $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$, the set $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$ cannot be open in $X$.\n\nThe preimage of the open set $\\{0\\}$ is $f^{-1}(\\{0\\}) = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$, which is not an open set in $X$. Therefore, the function $f: X \\to (Y, \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}})$ is not continuous. A similar argument holds for the open set $\\{1\\} \\in \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}$, whose preimage is the set of irrationals in $[0,1]$, which is also not open.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of $N$, the number of points of continuity**\n\nWe need to find the number of points $x_0 \\in X$ at which the function $f: X \\to (Y, \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}})$ is continuous. The definition of continuity at a single point $x_0$ is as follows: for every open neighborhood $V$ of $f(x_0)$ in $Y$, there must exist an open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ in $X$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V$.\n\nWe analyze the continuity at an arbitrary point $x_0 \\in [0,1]$ by considering two cases.\n\n**Case A: $x_0$ is a rational number ($x_0 \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$).**\nIn this case, $f(x_0) = 0$. In the discrete topology $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ on $Y$, the singleton set $V = \\{0\\}$ is an open set containing $f(x_0)$. So, $V$ is an open neighborhood of $f(x_0)$.\nFor $f$ to be continuous at $x_0$, there must exist an open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ in $X$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V = \\{0\\}$.\nAn open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0 \\in [0,1]$ must contain an open set of the form $(x_0-\\delta, x_0+\\delta) \\cap [0,1]$ for some $\\delta > 0$.\nThe condition $f(U) \\subseteq \\{0\\}$ implies that for every $y \\in U$, we must have $f(y) = 0$. This means that all points in $U$ must be rational.\nHowever, due to the density of irrational numbers in $\\mathbb{R}$, any interval $(x_0-\\delta, x_0+\\delta)$ contains irrational numbers. Thus, any open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ in $X$ must contain irrational points.\nLet $z$ be an irrational point in $U$. Then $f(z) = 1$. This implies $f(z) \\notin \\{0\\}$, so $f(U)$ is not a subset of $V = \\{0\\}$.\nThis contradicts the condition for continuity at $x_0$. Therefore, $f$ is not continuous at any rational point in $[0,1]$.\n\n**Case B: $x_0$ is an irrational number ($x_0 \\in ([0,1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q})$).**\nIn this case, $f(x_0) = 1$. In the discrete topology $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ on $Y$, the singleton set $V = \\{1\\}$ is an open set containing $f(x_0)$. So, $V$ is an open neighborhood of $f(x_0)$.\nFor $f$ to be continuous at $x_0$, there must exist an open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ in $X$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V = \\{1\\}$.\nThis means that all points in $U$ must be irrational.\nAs before, any open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ in $X$ must contain a set of the form $(x_0-\\delta, x_0+\\delta) \\cap [0,1]$ for some $\\delta > 0$.\nDue to the density of rational numbers in $\\mathbb{R}$, any such interval contains rational numbers.\nLet $q$ be a rational point in $U$. Then $f(q) = 0$. This implies $f(q) \\notin \\{1\\}$, so $f(U)$ is not a subset of $V = \\{1\\}$.\nThis contradicts the condition for continuity at $x_0$. Therefore, $f$ is not continuous at any irrational point in $[0,1]$.\n\nSince every point in $[0,1]$ is either rational or irrational, we have shown that $f$ is not continuous at any point in its domain $X = [0,1]$. The set of points where $f$ is continuous is the empty set.\nThe number of points $N$ at which $f$ is continuous is therefore $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3076949"}, {"introduction": "The quotient topology allows us to construct new and complex topological spaces by \"gluing\" together points of an existing space.

The points $p$ and $\\hat{0}$ are distinct in $Y$ because their corresponding equivalence classes, $A$ and $\\{0\\}$, are disjoint.\n\nThe quotient topology on $Y$ is defined such that a set $U \\subseteq Y$ is open if and only if its preimage $q^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in $X$.\n\n**Part 1: Justification that $Y$ is not Hausdorff**\n\nA topological space is Hausdorff (or T2) if for any two distinct points $y_1, y_2$ in the space, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods $U_1$ of $y_1$ and $U_2$ of $y_2$. To show $Y$ is not Hausdorff, we must find a pair of distinct points that cannot be separated by open neighborhoods. As suggested, we consider the points $p$ and $\\hat{0}$.\n\nLet $U_{\\hat{0}}$ be any open neighborhood of the point $\\hat{0}$ in $Y$. By the definition of the quotient topology, its preimage $V_{\\hat{0}} = q^{-1}(U_{\\hat{0}})$ must be an open set in $X$. Since $\\hat{0} \\in U_{\\hat{0}}$, the equivalence class of $\\hat{0}$, which is $\\{0\\}$, must be contained in the preimage. Thus, $0 \\in V_{\\hat{0}}$. This means $V_{\\hat{0}}$ is an open neighborhood of $0$ in $X$.\n\nThe set $A = \\{1/n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ has the point $0$ as a limit point in $X$. This is because the sequence of points $(1/n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, all of which are in $A$, converges to $0$. A fundamental property of a limit point is that any open neighborhood of the limit point must intersect the set. Therefore, $V_{\\hat{0}} \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet $a$ be a point in the intersection $V_{\\hat{0}} \\cap A$. Since $a \\in V_{\\hat{0}} = q^{-1}(U_{\\hat{0}})$, applying the map $q$ gives $q(a) \\in U_{\\hat{0}}$. But since $a \\in A$, by the definition of the equivalence relation, $q(a)=p$. Thus, we have shown that $p \\in U_{\\hat{0}}$.\n\nThis reasoning holds for any arbitrary open neighborhood $U_{\\hat{0}}$ of $\\hat{0}$. We have demonstrated that every open neighborhood of $\\hat{0}$ must also contain the point $p$.\n\nNow, let $U_p$ be any open neighborhood of $p$ and $U_{\\hat{0}}$ be any open neighborhood of $\\hat{0}$. Since $p \\in U_p$ by definition, and we have just proven that $p \\in U_{\\hat{0}}$, it follows that $p \\in U_p \\cap U_{\\hat{0}}$. This means their intersection is non-empty. It is therefore impossible to find disjoint open neighborhoods for the distinct points $p$ and $\\hat{0}$. Consequently, the space $Y$ fails to be Hausdorff.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of $N$**\n\n$N$ is the number of singleton subsets $\\{y\\} \\subset Y$ that are not closed in $Y$.\nBy the definition of the quotient topology, a subset $C \\subseteq Y$ is closed if and only if its preimage $q^{-1}(C)$ is a closed subset of $X$.\nFor a singleton subset $\\{y\\}$, this means $\\{y\\}$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if $q^{-1}(\\{y\\})$ is closed in $X$.\nThe preimage $q^{-1}(\\{y\\})$ is the set of all points in $X$ that are mapped to $y$. This is precisely the equivalence class corresponding to $y$.\n\nSo, the task reduces to finding the number of equivalence classes under $\\sim$ that are not closed sets in $X = [-1, 2]$. Let's examine the equivalence classes.\n\nCase 1: The equivalence class is $A = \\{1/n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nThis class corresponds to the point $p \\in Y$, so $q^{-1}(\\{p\\}) = A$. To determine if $\\{p\\}$ is closed in $Y$, we must check if $A$ is closed in $X$. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. As established before, $0$ is a limit point of $A$. Since $0 \\notin A$, $A$ is not a closed set in $X$. Therefore, the singleton set $\\{p\\}$ is not closed in $Y$.\n\nCase 2: The equivalence class is $\\{x\\}$ for some $x \\in X \\setminus A$.\nLet $y = q(x)$ be a point in $Y$ where $x \\in X \\setminus A$. The equivalence class corresponding to $y$ is $\\{x\\}$, so $q^{-1}(\\{y\\}) = \\{x\\}$. We need to check if the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is closed in $X$.\nThe space $X = [-1,2]$ with its standard topology is a Hausdorff (and thus T1) space. A fundamental property of T1 spaces is that all singleton sets are closed. For any $x \\in X$, its complement $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is open, meaning $\\{x\\}$ is closed.\nThis applies to every $x \\in X \\setminus A$. Therefore, for any point $y \\in Y \\setminus \\{p\\}$, its corresponding equivalence class is a closed set in $X$. This implies that every singleton set $\\{y\\}$ for $y \\neq p$ is closed in $Y$. This includes the point $\\hat{0} = q(0)$, whose corresponding class is $\\{0\\}$, which is closed in $X$.\n\nCombining these two cases, we find that there is exactly one equivalence class that is not a closed subset of $X$: the class $A$. This class corresponds to the single point $p \\in Y$. Thus, there is exactly one singleton subset of $Y$ that is not closed, namely $\\{p\\}$.\n\nThe number of such subsets is $1$.
