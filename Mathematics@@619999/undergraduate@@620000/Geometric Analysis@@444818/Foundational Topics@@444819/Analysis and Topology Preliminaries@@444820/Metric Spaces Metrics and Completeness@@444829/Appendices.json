In the metric space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard topology (which is induced by any of the metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, or $d_\\infty$), the set $Q$ is closed and bounded, and thus compact by the Heine-Borel theorem.

A continuous real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum values.

By definition of $Q$, we have $x_i \\in [0,1]$ and $y_i \\in [0,1]$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. This implies that for each component, the absolute difference is bounded: $|x_i - y_i| \\le 1$. This inequality will be central to our calculations.\n\n1.  **Diameter with respect to the metric $d_1$.**\nThe metric $d_1$ is defined as $d_1(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|$.\nUsing the bound $|x_i - y_i| \\le 1$ for each term in the sum, we can establish an upper bound for $d_1(x,y)$:\n$$ d_1(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i| \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n $$\nSo, for any two points $x,y \\in Q$, their distance $d_1(x,y)$ is at most $n$. To show that the diameter is exactly $n$, we must demonstrate that this upper bound is attained for some pair of points in $Q$.\nConsider the two vertices of the hypercube: $\\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{1} = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)$. Both points belong to $Q$. The distance between them is:\n$$ d_1(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |0 - 1| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n $$\nSince we have found a pair of points in $Q$ for which the distance is $n$, and we have shown that no pair of points can have a distance greater than $n$, the maximum distance is $n$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{diam}_{d_1}(Q) = n$.\n\n2.  **Diameter with respect to the metric $d_2$.**\nThe metric $d_2$ is defined as $d_2(x,y) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|^2 \\right)^{1/2}$.\nUsing the bound $|x_i - y_i| \\le 1$, we have $|x_i - y_i|^2 \\le 1^2 = 1$.

We can again use the vertices $\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{1}$:\n$$ d_\\infty(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{1}) = \\max_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} |0 - 1| = \\max\\{1, 1, \\dots, 1\\} = 1 $$\nAlternatively, we could choose $x = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$ and $y = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$. Both are in $Q$. Then\n$$ d_\\infty(x,y) = \\max\\{|0-1|, |0-0|, \\dots, |0-0|\\} = \\max\\{1, 0, \\dots, 0\\} = 1 $$\nThe upper bound of $1$ is attainable.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{diam}_{d_\\infty}(Q) = 1$.\n\nIn summary, the diameters are:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}_{d_1}(Q) = n $$\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}_{d_2}(Q) = \\sqrt{n} $$\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}_{d_\\infty}(Q) = 1 $$\n\nThe problem also asks to compare these values. For $n \\geq 1$, we have $n \\geq 1$ and $\\sqrt{n} \\geq 1$.\nComparing $n$ and $\\sqrt{n}$: since $n \\geq 1$, we can square both sides of the inequality $\\sqrt{n} \\leq n$ to get $n \\leq n^2$, which is equivalent to $n(n-1) \\geq 0$. This is true for all $n \\geq 1$. Equality holds if and only if $n=1$.\nThus, for any integer $n \\geq 1$, we have the ordering $n \\geq \\sqrt{n} \\geq 1$. This implies the relationship between the diameters:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}_{d_1}(Q) \\ge \\operatorname{diam}_{d_2}(Q) \\ge \\operatorname{diam}_{d_\\infty}(Q) $$\n\nThe final answer is the triple of these computed diameters.\nThe triple is $(\\operatorname{diam}_{d_1}(Q), \\operatorname{diam}_{d_2}(Q), \\operatorname{diam}_{d_\\infty}(Q)) = (n, \\sqrt{n}, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nn & \\sqrt{n} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3056751"}, {"introduction": "Building on the different ways to measure distance, we now explore a fundamental geometric consequence of choosing a metric: the shape of its open balls.

Let $x = (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ be the center and $r > 0$ be the radius.

The existence of such constants $c=1$ and $C=n$ proves that the metrics $d_{\\max}$ and $d_{+}$ are equivalent on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nEquivalent metrics induce the same topology, meaning they have the same collection of open sets. A key consequence of metric equivalence is that a sequence is a Cauchy sequence in one metric if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence in the other. This implies that one metric space is complete if and only if the other is. Since $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_{\\text{Euclidean}})$ is a complete metric space, and all norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent, both $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_{\\max})$ and $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_{+})$ are complete.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A:** The description of the shapes of the balls in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is correct. The formula for the open ball in a product space $(X \\times Y, d_{\\max})$ is correct, as $d((x,y),(x',y'))<r$ becomes $\\max(d_X(x,x'),d_Y(y,y'))<r$, which is equivalent to $d_X(x,x')<r$ AND $d_Y(y,y')<r$. The formula for the open ball in $(X \\times Y, d_{+})$ is also correct. A point $(x', y')$ is in the ball if $d_X(x,x') + d_Y(y,y') < r$. This is the definition of the union of products of smaller balls $B_X(x,s)$ and $B_Y(y,r-s)$ for all possible $s \\in (0,r)$. The statement is completely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:** The description of the ball shapes is false. $B_{d_{\\max}}(x,r)$ is an axis-aligned square and $B_{d_{+}}(x,r)$ is a rotated square (diamond). A Euclidean circle is the ball under the Euclidean metric. The claim that $(\\mathbb{R}^2, d_{+})$ is not complete is also false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:** The balls are indeed convex polygons with $4$ sides, but their orientations are not identical. The sides of the $d_{\\max}$ ball are parallel to the coordinate axes, while the sides of the $d_{+}$ ball are at a $45^\\circ$ angle to the axes. The implication that the metrics induce distinct topologies is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:** The first part is correct: $B_{d_{\\max}}(x,r)$ is a product of open intervals. The second part is false: $B_{d_{+}}(x,r)$ is a rotated square, not a Euclidean disk. The implication is also false; completeness of a product depends on the completeness of the factor spaces, not their compactness.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E:** The geometric descriptions of the balls in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (hypercube for $d_{\\max}$, cross-polytope for $d_{+}$) are correct. The implication that the metrics are equivalent (the existence of constants $c, C$) is correct, as shown above. The subsequent conclusion that equivalent metrics generate the same topology is a fundamental theorem. The final conclusion that completeness of one space implies completeness of the other is a direct and correct consequence of metric equivalence.
