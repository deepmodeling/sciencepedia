The first three properties follow directly from the definitions. The triangle inequality, $d^*(u, w) \\le d^*(u, v) + d^*(v, w)$, requires a careful case-by-case analysis depending on whether $u, v, w$ are in $X$ or are the point $\\infty$. The key step in the proof involves using the property $|f(x)-f(y)| \\le d(x,y)$, which can be derived from the mean value theorem or by direct algebraic manipulation: $|1/f(x) - 1/f(y)| = |d(x,x_0) - d(y,x_0)| \\le d(x,y)$. With this, all cases of the triangle inequality can be established.\n\nNext, one must show that the topology induced by the metric $d^*$ is the same as the one-point compactification topology on $X^*$. This is done by showing that for any point $p \\in X^*$, the basis of open neighborhoods for $p$ in both topologies are equivalent. For points in $X$, this is straightforward. For the point $\\infty$, a neighborhood in the metric $d^*$ is a ball $B_\\epsilon(\\infty) = \\{y \\in X \\mid f(y) < \\epsilon\\} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$. This is equivalent to $\\{y \\in X \\mid d(y,x_0) > 1/\\epsilon - 1\\} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$. The complement in $X$ is the set $\\{y \\mid d(y,x_0) \\le 1/\\epsilon - 1 \\}$, which is a closed ball. Since $X$ is a proper metric space, this closed ball is compact. Thus, neighborhoods in the $d^*$ topology correspond exactly to neighborhoods in the one-point compactification topology.\n\nNow, we specialize to $X = \\mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y)=|x-y|$ and $x_0=0$, so $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+|x|}$.
