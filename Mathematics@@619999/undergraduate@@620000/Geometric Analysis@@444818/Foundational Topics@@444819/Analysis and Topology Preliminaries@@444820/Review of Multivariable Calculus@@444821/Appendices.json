All necessary information is provided, and the problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n\nWe are asked to analyze the behavior of the function $f(x,y) = \\dfrac{x^{2}y}{x^{4}+y^{2}}$ as the point $(x,y)$ approaches the origin $(0,0)$. To do this, we will investigate the limit of the function along the family of parabolic curves defined by the equation $y = kx^{2}$, where $k$ is a real parameter. The limit along a specific path in this family is denoted by $L(k)$.\n\nBy definition, the limit along this path is $L(k) = \\lim_{x\\to 0} f\\bigl(x, kx^{2}\\bigr)$. We substitute the expression for $y$ into the function $f(x,y)$:\n$$\nf(x, kx^{2}) = \\frac{x^{2}(kx^{2})}{x^{4} + (kx^{2})^{2}}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator and the denominator, we get:\n$$\nf(x, kx^{2}) = \\frac{kx^{4}}{x^{4} + k^{2}x^{4}}\n$$\nThe evaluation of the limit as $x \\to 0$ implies that $x$ approaches $0$ but is not equal to $0$. Therefore, we can safely assume $x \\neq 0$, which allows us to factor out $x^{4}$ from the denominator and cancel it with the $x^{4}$ in the numerator.\n$$\nf(x, kx^{2}) = \\frac{x^{4}(k)}{x^{4}(1+k^{2})} = \\frac{k}{1+k^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression is a constant with respect to $x$. Therefore, the limit is the expression itself:\n$$\nL(k) = \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{k}{1+k^{2}} = \\frac{k}{1+k^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the explicit analytic expression for the limit $L(k)$ in terms of the parameter $k$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to use this result to decide whether there exists any constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for which the extended function $g(x,y)$ is continuous at $(0,0)$.\nFor $g$ to be continuous at $(0,0)$, the limit $\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)} g(x,y)$ must exist and must be equal to $g(0,0) = c$. The existence of this two-dimensional limit requires that the function approaches the same value regardless of the path taken to the origin.\n\nOur result for $L(k) = \\frac{k}{1+k^{2}}$ shows that the limit of the function as it approaches $(0,0)$ depends on the value of $k$, which dictates the specific parabolic path of approach. For example:\n- Along the path $y=x^{2}$ (where $k=1$), the limit is $L(1) = \\frac{1}{1+1^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Along the path $y=2x^{2}$ (where $k=2$), the limit is $L(2) = \\frac{2}{1+2^{2}} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n- Along the path $y=0$ (which corresponds to $k=0$), the limit is $L(0) = \\frac{0}{1+0^{2}} = 0$.\n\nSince we have found at least two different paths that yield different limit values (e.g., $\\frac{1}{2} \\neq \\frac{2}{5}$), we conclude that the general limit $\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)} f(x,y)$ does not exist.\nBecause the limit does not exist, there is no value $c$ that can be assigned to $g(0,0)$ that would satisfy the condition for continuity, $\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)} g(x,y) = g(0,0)$. Consequently, the function $g$ cannot be made continuous at the origin for any choice of $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe problem explicitly asks for the expression for $L(k)$ as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k}{1+k^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3060434"}, {"introduction": "Once we have a grasp on limits, we can define the derivative of a mapping between multidimensional spaces.

The specific mapping is related to the complex function $f(z) = z^2$, which is a cornerstone example in complex analysis. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The component functions of the mapping $F$ are polynomials, which are infinitely differentiable. This ensures that the Jacobian matrix and its determinant are well-defined for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The tasks are specific and lead to a unique, well-defined solution.

This linear transformation is represented by the Jacobian matrix $J_F(x,y)$, which is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of the component functions. The Jacobian matrix is defined as:\n$$\nJ_F(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the required partial derivatives:\n- $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 - y^2) = 2x$\n- $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 - y^2) = -2y$\n- $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2xy) = 2y$\n- $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2xy) = 2x$\n\nSubstituting these into the matrix, we obtain the Jacobian matrix of $F$:\n$$\nJ_F(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & -2y \\\\ 2y & 2x \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, denoted $\\det J_F(x,y)$. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, the determinant is $ad - bc$.\n$$\n\\det J_F(x,y) = (2x)(2x) - (-2y)(2y) = 4x^2 - (-4y^2) = 4x^2 + 4y^2\n$$\nSo, the determinant is $\\det J_F(x,y) = 4(x^2 + y^2)$.\n\nNow, we interpret this result. The linearization of the map $F$ at a point $p_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ is given by $L(p) = F(p_0) + J_F(p_0)(p - p_0)$. This means that for a small displacement $\\Delta p = (\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ from $p_0$, the change in $F$ is approximately $\\Delta F \\approx J_F(p_0) \\Delta p$. The key insight from linear algebra is that for a linear transformation represented by a matrix $A$, the absolute value of its determinant, $|\\det(A)|$, represents the factor by which area (in $\\mathbb{R}^2$) or volume (in higher dimensions) is scaled.\n\nApplying this to our case, the Jacobian determinant, $\\det J_F(x,y)$, describes how the mapping $F$ scales infinitesimal areas locally at the point $(x,y)$. An infinitesimal area element $dA = dx\\,dy$ in the domain is transformed into an infinitesimal area element $dA' = | \\det J_F(x,y) | \\,dx\\,dy$ in the codomain. Therefore, $|\\det J_F(x,y)| = |4(x^2 + y^2)| = 4(x^2 + y^2)$ is the local area scaling factor. The factor $4(x^2+y^2)$ indicates that areas near the origin are scaled by a very small amount (approaching $0$), while areas far from the origin are scaled by a large amount.\n\nThe sign of the determinant indicates whether the local orientation is preserved or reversed.\n- If $\\det J_F(x,y) > 0$, the mapping is locally **orientation-preserving**. It maps a right-handed coordinate system in the tangent space of the domain to a right-handed one in the tangent space of the codomain.\n- If $\\det J_F(x,y) < 0$, the mapping is locally **orientation-reversing**.\n- If $\\det J_F(x,y) = 0$, the mapping is **singular** at that point. It is not locally invertible, and the linear approximation collapses area onto a line or a point.\n\nIn our case, $\\det J_F(x,y) = 4(x^2 + y^2)$. Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $y^2 \\ge 0$. Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 \\ge 0$.\n- The determinant is strictly positive, $\\det J_F(x,y) > 0$, for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ except for the origin $(0,0)$. Thus, the mapping is orientation-preserving everywhere except at the origin.\n- The determinant is zero, $\\det J_F(x,y) = 0$, if and only if $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which occurs only at the point $(x,y) = (0,0)$.

A convenient method is to integrate the area of the cross-sections of the solid perpendicular to one of the axes. Let us consider cross-sections perpendicular to the $z$-axis.\n\nFor a fixed value of $z$, the defining inequalities become:\n$$ x^2 \\leq 1 - z^2 $$\n$$ y^2 \\leq 1 - z^2 $$\nFor these inequalities to have real solutions for $x$ and $y$, the right-hand side must be non-negative, so $1 - z^2 \\geq 0$, which implies $z^2 \\leq 1$.
