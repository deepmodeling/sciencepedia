Before we can appreciate the theorem's full scope, we must first develop a solid intuition for these fundamental building blocks. This exercise challenges you to apply the definition of a nowhere dense set—a set whose closure has an empty interior—to various familiar subsets of the real numbers, helping you distinguish between sets that are 'small' in this topological sense and those that are not [@problem_id:1327237].", "problem": "In real analysis, a set $S$ within the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is defined as **nowhere dense** if the interior of its closure is the empty set.
