No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem presents two related scenarios, one in the context of an abstract real vector space and another in the context of a smooth manifold. Both scenarios investigate the effect of swapping two adjacent elements in an ordered basis or coordinate system on the defined orientation.\n\nPart 1: Vector Space Orientation\n\nLet $V$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space. An orientation on $V$ is an equivalence class of ordered bases. Two ordered bases, $B_{v} = (v_{1}, \\dots, v_{n})$ and $B_{w} = (w_{1}, \\dots, w_{n})$, are said to have the same orientation if the change-of-basis matrix from $B_{v}$ to $B_{w}$ has a positive determinant. Let $P$ be this matrix, defined by the relations $w_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{ij} v_{i}$ for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The bases have the same orientation if $\\det(P)  0$ and opposite orientations if $\\det(P)  0$.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a positively oriented basis $B_{v} = (v_{1}, \\dots, v_{n})$. A new basis $B_{w} = (w_{1}, \\dots, w_{n})$ is constructed by swapping the $k$-th and $(k+1)$-th vectors, where $1 \\leq k  n$. The relations are explicitly given as:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $w_{i} = v_{i}$ for $i \\neq k, k+1$\n    \\item $w_{k} = v_{k+1}$\n    \\item $w_{k+1} = v_{k}$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe construct the change-of-basis matrix $P$ by writing each $w_{j}$ as a linear combination of the vectors $v_{i}$. The coefficients of these combinations form the columns of $P$.\n\nFor $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ where $j \\neq k$ and $j \\neq k+1$, we have $w_{j} = v_{j}$. In terms of the basis $B_v$, this is $w_{j} = 0 \\cdot v_{1} + \\dots + 1 \\cdot v_{j} + \\dots + 0 \\cdot v_{n}$. The $j$-th column of $P$ is thus the standard basis vector $e_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nFor $j=k$, we have $w_{k} = v_{k+1}$. This corresponds to the linear combination $w_{k} = 0 \\cdot v_{1} + \\dots + 1 \\cdot v_{k+1} + \\dots + 0 \\cdot v_{n}$. The $k$-th column of $P$ is therefore the standard basis vector $e_{k+1}$.\n\nFor $j=k+1$, we have $w_{k+1} = v_{k}$. This corresponds to the linear combination $w_{k+1} = 0 \\cdot v_{1} + \\dots + 1 \\cdot v_{k} + \\dots + 0 \\cdot v_{n}$. The $(k+1)$-th column of $P$ is the standard basis vector $e_{k}$.\n\nCombining these results, the matrix $P$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_{n}$, with its $k$-th and $(k+1)$-th columns swapped. Such a matrix is a permutation matrix corresponding to the transposition that swaps $k$ and $k+1$. A fundamental property of determinants states that swapping two columns of a matrix negates its determinant. Therefore, the determinant of $P$ is:\n$$\n\\det(P) = \\det(I_n \\text{ with columns } k, k+1 \\text{ swapped}) = - \\det(I_n) = -1\n$$\nSince $\\det(P) = -1  0$, the basis $B_{w}$ has the opposite orientation to the basis $B_{v}$.\n\nThe oriented top-degree volume element, $\\omega \\in \\Lambda^n V^*$, is a multilinear map that acts on ordered bases. Its transformation under a change of basis is given by $\\omega(w_1, \\dots, w_n) = \\det(P) \\omega(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$. Thus, the value of the volume element changes by a factor of $\\det(P)$, which is $-1$.\n\nPart 2: Manifold Orientation\n\nLet $M$ be an oriented $n$-dimensional smooth manifold. An orientation on $M$ can be defined by an atlas of charts such that the Jacobian determinant of any transition map between two overlapping charts is positive. If $(U, (x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n}))$ is a chart compatible with the orientation (a \"positively oriented chart\"), then any other chart $(U, (y^{1}, \\dots, y^{n}))$ is positively oriented if the Jacobian determinant of the coordinate change $\\psi: (x^1, \\dots, x^n) \\mapsto (y^1, \\dots, y^n)$ is positive.\n\nWe are given the coordinate reparametrization $\\psi$ defined by:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $y^{i} = x^{i}$ for $i \\neq k, k+1$\n    \\item $y^{k} = x^{k+1}$\n    \\item $y^{k+1} = x^{k}$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe Jacobian matrix of this transformation, $J = D\\psi$, has entries $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial y^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}$. We compute these partial derivatives:\n\nFor a row $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ where $i \\neq k$ and $i \\neq k+1$, we have $y^{i} = x^{i}$. The partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial y^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\delta_{ij}$. This means that these rows of the Jacobian matrix are identical to the corresponding rows of the identity matrix.\n\nFor row $k$, we have $y^{k} = x^{k+1}$. The partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial y^{k}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\frac{\\partial x^{k+1}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\delta_{k+1, j}$. This row has a $1$ in the $(k+1)$-th column and $0$s elsewhere.\n\nFor row $k+1$, we have $y^{k+1} = x^{k}$. The partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial y^{k+1}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\frac{\\partial x^{k}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\delta_{k, j}$. This row has a $1$ in the $k$-th column and $0$s elsewhere.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ is therefore the $n \\times n$ identity matrix with its $k$-th and $(k+1)$-th rows swapped. The determinant of such a matrix is $-1$:\n$$\n\\det(D\\psi(p)) = \\det(J) = -1\n$$\nThe value is constant throughout the chart domain $U$. Since the Jacobian determinant is negative, the new chart $(U, (y^{1}, \\dots, y^{n}))$ is negatively oriented relative to the original chart $(U, (x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n}))$.\n\nIn both the vector space and manifold settings, the operation of swapping two adjacent basis vectors or coordinates results in a reversal of orientation. This reversal corresponds to a multiplicative factor of $-1$ on the determinant of the relevant transformation matrix.
