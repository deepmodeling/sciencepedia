The set of $2$-forms $\\{du^{a}\\wedge du^{b}\\}_{1\\leq a < b \\leq m}$ forms a basis for the space of $2$-forms on $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$. We can rewrite the sum by grouping the terms for each basis element:\n$$f^{*}(dx^{i}\\wedge dx^{j}) = \\sum_{1\\leq a<b\\leq m} \\left(\\frac{\\partial f^{i}}{\\partial u^{a}}\\frac{\\partial f^{j}}{\\partial u^{b}} - \\frac{\\partial f^{i}}{\\partial u^{b}}\\frac{\\partial f^{j}}{\\partial u^{a}}\\right) du^{a}\\wedge du^{b}.$$\nThe coefficient of $du^{a}\\wedge du^{b}$ is the determinant of a $2\\times 2$ matrix:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f^{i}}{\\partial u^{a}}\\frac{\\partial f^{j}}{\\partial u^{b}} - \\frac{\\partial f^{i}}{\\partial u^{b}}\\frac{\\partial f^{j}}{\\partial u^{a}} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f^{i}}{\\partial u^{a}} & \\frac{\\partial f^{i}}{\\partial u^{b}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f^{j}}{\\partial u^{a}} & \\frac{\\partial f^{j}}{\\partial u^{b}} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThis determinant is the Jacobian determinant of the functions $(f^i, f^j)$ with respect to the variables $(u^a, u^b)$, commonly denoted as $\\frac{\\partial(f^{i},f^{j})}{\\partial(u^{a},u^{b})}$. This is precisely the $2\\times 2$ minor of the Jacobian matrix of $f$, $Df = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f^{k}}{\\partial u^{c}}\\right)$, corresponding to rows $i,j$ and columns $a,b$.\nTherefore, the coordinate expression for the pullback is:\n$$f^{*}(dx^{i}\\wedge dx^{j}) = \\sum_{1\\leq a<b\\leq m} \\frac{\\partial(f^{i},f^{j})}{\\partial(u^{a},u^{b})} du^{a}\\wedge du^{b}.$$\n\n2) Calculation of $f^{*}\\omega$ for the specific case\n\nWe are given $m=2$, $n=3$, with coordinates $(u,v)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $(x^{1},x^{2},x^{3})$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The map $f$ is given by its component functions:\n$$f^{1}(u,v)=u^{2}v$$\n$$f^{2}(u,v)=u+v^{2}$$\n$$f^{3}(u,v)=uv+v$$\nThe $2$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is $\\omega=dx^{1}\\wedge dx^{3}+2\\,dx^{2}\\wedge dx^{3}$.\nSince the pullback operator $f^*$ is linear, we have:\n$$f^{*}\\omega = f^{*}(dx^{1}\\wedge dx^{3}) + 2f^{*}(dx^{2}\\wedge dx^{3}).$$\nIn this case, $m=2$, so the coordinates are $u^{1}=u$ and $u^{2}=v$. There is only one basis $2$-form on the domain, $du\\wedge dv$. The sum from part 1 reduces to a single term with $(a,b)=(1,2)$.\n$$f^{*}(dx^{i}\\wedge dx^{j}) = \\frac{\\partial(f^{i},f^{j})}{\\partial(u,v)} du\\wedge dv.$$\nWe need to compute two Jacobian determinants. First, for $f^{*}(dx^{1}\\wedge dx^{3})$:\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f^{1}}{\\partial u} = 2uv$, $\\frac{\\partial f^{1}}{\\partial v} = u^{2}$\n$\\frac{\\partial f^{3}}{\\partial u} = v$, $\\frac{\\partial f^{3}}{\\partial v} = u+1$\nThe Jacobian is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial(f^{1},f^{3})}{\\partial(u,v)} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2uv & u^{2} \\\\ v & u+1 \\end{pmatrix} = (2uv)(u+1) - (u^{2})(v) = 2u^{2}v+2uv-u^{2}v = u^{2}v+2uv.$$\nSecond, for $f^{*}(dx^{2}\\wedge dx^{3})$:\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f^{2}}{\\partial u} = 1$, $\\frac{\\partial f^{2}}{\\partial v} = 2v$\n$\\frac{\\partial f^{3}}{\\partial u} = v$, $\\frac{\\partial f^{3}}{\\partial v} = u+1$\nThe Jacobian is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial(f^{2},f^{3})}{\\partial(u,v)} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2v \\\\ v & u+1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(u+1) - (2v)(v) = u+1-2v^{2}.$$\nCombining these results, we get the expression for $f^{*}\\omega$:\n$$f^{*}\\omega = (u^{2}v+2uv)du\\wedge dv + 2(u+1-2v^{2})du\\wedge dv$$\n$$f^{*}\\omega = (u^{2}v+2uv+2u+2-4v^{2})du\\wedge dv.$$\n\n3) Computation of the integral using Stokes' theorem\n\nWe need to compute $I=\\int_{\\Delta}f^{*}\\omega$, where $\\Delta$ is the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$. The problem requires using Stokes' theorem on smooth manifolds with boundary, which states $\\int_{M}d\\eta = \\int_{\\partial M}\\eta$.\nHere, our manifold is $M=\\Delta$, a $2$-dimensional manifold with boundary in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The integrand, $f^{*}\\omega$, is a $2$-form on $\\Delta$. To apply Stokes' theorem, we must express $f^{*}\\omega$ as the exterior derivative of a $1$-form on $\\Delta$.\nWe first find a $1$-form $\\alpha$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that $d\\alpha=\\omega$. Let $\\alpha = A_{1}dx^{1}+A_{2}dx^{2}+A_{3}dx^{3}$. Its exterior derivative is:\n$$d\\alpha = (\\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial x^{1}}-\\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial x^{2}})dx^{1}\\wedge dx^{2} + (\\frac{\\partial A_{3}}{\\partial x^{1}}-\\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial x^{3}})dx^{1}\\wedge dx^{3} + (\\frac{\\partial A_{3}}{\\partial x^{2}}-\\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial x^{3}})dx^{2}\\wedge dx^{3}.$$\nWe are given $\\omega = dx^{1}\\wedge dx^{3}+2\\,dx^{2}\\wedge dx^{3}$. Comparing coefficients, we need to solve:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial x^{1}}-\\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial x^{2}} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial A_{3}}{\\partial x^{1}}-\\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial x^{3}} = 1$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial A_{3}}{\\partial x^{2}}-\\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial x^{3}} = 2$\nThis system is underdetermined. We can make a simplifying choice. Let $A_{3}=0$. The equations become:\n2. $-\\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial x^{3}} = 1 \\implies A_{1} = -x^{3} + g(x^{1},x^{2})$\n3. $-\\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial x^{3}} = 2 \\implies A_{2} = -2x^{3} + h(x^{1},x^{2})$\nFor simplicity, we choose the integration constants $g$ and $h$ to be zero. So, $A_1 = -x^3$ and $A_2 = -2x^3$.\nWe check equation 1: $\\frac{\\partial(-2x^3)}{\\partial x^1} - \\frac{\\partial(-x^3)}{\\partial x^2} = 0 - 0 = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\nA valid choice for the $1$-form is $\\alpha = -x^{3}dx^{1} - 2x^{3}dx^{2}$.\n\nUsing the property $f^{*}(d\\alpha) = d(f^{*}\\alpha)$, we have $f^{*}\\omega = f^{*}(d\\alpha) = d(f^{*}\\alpha)$.\nStokes' theorem now gives:\n$$I = \\int_{\\Delta} f^{*}\\omega = \\int_{\\Delta} d(f^{*}\\alpha) = \\int_{\\partial \\Delta} f^{*}\\alpha.$$\nWe calculate the pullback $f^{*}\\alpha$:\n$$f^{*}\\alpha = f^{*}(-x^{3}dx^{1} - 2x^{3}dx^{2}) = -(f^{*}x^{3})f^{*}(dx^{1}) - 2(f^{*}x^{3})f^{*}(dx^{2})$$\n$$f^{*}\\alpha = -f^{3}d(f^{1}) - 2f^{3}d(f^{2}).$$\nUsing the given functions:\n$f^{3} = uv+v = v(u+1)$\n$df^{1} = d(u^{2}v) = 2uv\\,du + u^{2}\\,dv$\n$df^{2} = d(u+v^{2}) = du + 2v\\,dv$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $f^{*}\\alpha$:\n$$f^{*}\\alpha = -v(u+1)(2uv\\,du + u^{2}\\,dv) - 2v(u+1)(du+2v\\,dv)$$\n$$f^{*}\\alpha = \\big(-2uv^{2}(u+1) - 2v(u+1)\\big)du + \\big(-u^{2}v(u+1) - 4v^{2}(u+1)\\big)dv$$\nLet this $1$-form be $\\eta = P(u,v)du + Q(u,v)dv$.\nThe boundary $\\partial\\Delta$ is composed of three oriented line segments:\n$C_{1}$: from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, parameterized by $\\gamma_{1}(t)=(t,0)$ for $t\\in[0,1]$.\n$C_{2}$: from $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$, parameterized by $\\gamma_{2}(t)=(1-t,t)$ for $t\\in[0,1]$.\n$C_{3}$: from $(0,1)$ to $(0,0)$, parameterized by $\\gamma_{3}(t)=(0,1-t)$ for $t\\in[0,1]$.\nThe total integral is the sum of integrals over these segments: $\\int_{\\partial\\Delta}\\eta = \\int_{C_1}\\eta + \\int_{C_2}\\eta + \\int_{C_3}\\eta$.\n\nOn $C_{1}$: $u=t, v=0$. Since the coefficients $P(u,v)$ and $Q(u,v)$ both contain a factor of $v$, the pullback form is zero along this segment. Thus, $\\int_{C_1}\\eta = 0$.\n\nOn $C_{2}$: $u=1-t, v=t$. This gives $du=-dt, dv=dt$. The integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} \\big(-P(1-t,t) + Q(1-t,t)\\big)dt$. The integrand, $-P(1-t, t)+Q(1-t, t)$, simplifies as follows: $t(2-t)[2(-t^2+t+1)-(t+1)^2] = (2t-t^2)(-3t^2+1) = 3t^4-6t^3-t^2+2t$.\n$$\\int_{C_2}\\eta = \\int_{0}^{1}(3t^{4}-6t^{3}-t^{2}+2t)dt = \\left[\\frac{3}{5}t^{5} - \\frac{3}{2}t^{4} - \\frac{1}{3}t^{3} + t^{2}\\right]_{0}^{1}$$\n$$= \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} + 1 = \\frac{18 - 45 - 10 + 30}{30} = -\\frac{7}{30}.$$\n\nOn $C_{3}$: $u=0, v=1-t$. This gives $du=0, dv=-dt$. The integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} Q(0,1-t)(-dt)$.\n$Q(u,v) = -v(u+1)(u^2+4v)$.\n$Q(0,1-t) = -(1-t)(1)(0+4(1-t)) = -4(1-t)^2$.\n$$\\int_{C_3}\\eta = \\int_{0}^{1}-4(1-t)^{2} (-dt) = 4\\int_{0}^{1}(1-t)^{2}dt = 4\\left[-\\frac{(1-t)^{3}}{3}\\right]_{0}^{1} = 4\\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}.$$\n\nFinally, the total integral is the sum of the integrals over the boundary segments:\n$$I = \\int_{\\partial\\Delta}f^{*}\\alpha = 0 - \\frac{7}{30} + \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{-7+40}{30} = \\frac{33}{30} = \\frac{11}{10}.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{11}{10}}$$", "id": "3063849"}]}
