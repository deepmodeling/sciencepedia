Before we can assemble the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology groups, it's essential to understand how forms behave on overlapping open sets.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically grounded problem in differential geometry, resting on fundamental definitions.\n\nThe problem asks us to consider the manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with its global coordinates $(x,y)$. We are given an open cover of $M$ by two sets: $U = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x  0\\}$ and $V = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x  1\\}$. The union of these two open sets is $U \\cup V = \\mathbb{R}^2 = M$. We are also given a smooth differential $1$-form on $M$, $\\omega = x \\, dy \\in \\Omega^{1}(M)$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the intersection of the two open sets, $U \\cap V$. By definition, a point $(x,y)$ is in $U \\cap V$ if and only if it is in both $U$ and $V$.\nThe condition for being in $U$ is $x  0$.\nThe condition for being in $V$ is $x  1$.\nTherefore, the intersection is the set of points $(x,y)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that both conditions are met:\n$$U \\cap V = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid 0  x  1\\}$$\nThis is an open vertical strip in the plane.\n\nNext, we compute the restrictions of the form $\\omega$ to the open sets $U$, $V$, and $U \\cap V$. The restriction of a differential form to an open subset is conceptually straightforward. If $S \\subset M$ is an open subset and $i: S \\hookrightarrow M$ is the inclusion map, the restriction of $\\omega \\in \\Omega^k(M)$ to $S$ is the pullback form $\\omega|_S = i^*\\omega \\in \\Omega^k(S)$. In practice, since the form $\\omega = x \\, dy$ is defined by an expression that is smooth everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, its restrictions to $U$, $V$, and $U \\cap V$ are given by the same expression, but are understood to be defined only on the respective domains.\n\n1.  The restriction of $\\omega$ to $U$, denoted $\\omega|_U$, is the form $\\omega$ considered as an element of $\\Omega^{1}(U)$. Since the expression $x \\, dy$ is well-defined on $U$, we have:\n    $$\\omega|_U = x \\, dy \\in \\Omega^{1}(U)$$\n2.  Similarly, the restriction of $\\omega$ to $V$, denoted $\\omega|_V$, is the form $\\omega$ considered as an element of $\\Omega^{1}(V)$. The expression $x \\, dy$ is well-defined on $V$, so:\n    $$\\omega|_V = x \\, dy \\in \\Omega^{1}(V)$$\n3.  The restriction of $\\omega$ to the intersection $U \\cap V$, denoted $\\omega|_{U \\cap V}$, is the form $\\omega$ considered as an element of $\\Omega^{1}(U \\cap V)$. The expression $x \\, dy$ is well-defined on $U \\cap V$, thus:\n    $$\\omega|_{U \\cap V} = x \\, dy \\in \\Omega^{1}(U \\cap V)$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks us to investigate the compatibility condition required in the Mayer-Vietoris framework by considering the difference $\\omega|_U - \\omega|_V$ on the intersection $U \\cap V$. In the context of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology, one considers the map $\\delta: \\Omega^k(U) \\oplus \\Omega^k(V) \\to \\Omega^k(U \\cap V)$ defined by $\\delta(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\alpha|_{U \\cap V} - \\beta|_{U \\cap V}$. A form $\\eta \\in \\Omega^k(M)$ gives rise to a pair of forms $(\\eta|_U, \\eta|_V) \\in \\Omega^k(U) \\oplus \\Omega^k(V)$. The sequence is exact at this stage, which means that the image of the restriction map from $\\Omega^k(M)$ is precisely the kernel of $\\delta$. This is the compatibility condition: a pair of forms $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ on $(U,V)$ comes from a global form on $M=U \\cup V$ if and only if they agree on the overlap, i.e., $\\alpha|_{U \\cap V} = \\beta|_{U \\cap V}$.\n\nWe are asked to verify this for the form $\\omega$. We must compute the difference of the restrictions of $\\omega|_U$ and $\\omega|_V$ to the common domain $U \\cap V$.\nThe restriction of $\\omega|_U$ to $U \\cap V$ is:\n$$(\\omega|_U)|_{U \\cap V} = (x \\, dy)|_{U \\cap V} = x \\, dy \\in \\Omega^{1}(U \\cap V)$$\nThe restriction of $\\omega|_V$ to $U \\cap V$ is:\n$$(\\omega|_V)|_{U \\cap V} = (x \\, dy)|_{U \\cap V} = x \\, dy \\in \\Omega^{1}(U \\cap V)$$\nBy fundamental properties of restriction, both of these are simply equal to the direct restriction $\\omega|_{U \\cap V}$.\n\nThe difference on $U \\cap V$ is therefore:\n$$(\\omega|_U)|_{U \\cap V} - (\\omega|_V)|_{U \\cap V} = (x \\, dy) - (x \\, dy) = 0$$\nwhere $0$ is the zero $1$-form on $U \\cap V$. This demonstrates that the compatibility condition holds, which is necessarily true because the forms $\\omega|_U$ and $\\omega|_V$ originate from a single, globally defined form $\\omega$ on $M = U \\cup V$. The very definition of a smooth form on $M$ implies that its restrictions to any two open sets of a cover must agree on their intersection.\n\nThe question asks for the final answer to be the row matrix of the three restricted forms $\\omega|_U$, $\\omega|_V$, and $\\omega|_{U\\cap V}$. Although they are defined on different domains, their coordinate expressions are identical.\n\nThe restricted forms are:\n$\\omega|_U = x \\, dy$\n$\\omega|_V = x \\, dy$\n$\\omega|_{U \\cap V} = x \\, dy$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} x \\, dy  x \\, dy  x \\, dy \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3072110"}, {"introduction": "With the fundamentals in place, we can now apply the full power of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to a classic problem: calculating the cohomology of an annulus.

We are given an open cover $A=U\\cup V$, where $U=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:r_{1}\\|x\\|t\\}$ and $V=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:s\\|x\\|r_{2}\\}$ for some $r_{1}str_{2}$.

The spaces $U$, $V$, and $U \\cap V$ are all open annuli in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. An open annulus of the form $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : a  \\|x\\|  b\\}$ is diffeomorphic to the product manifold $S^{1} \\times (a,b)$ via the map $(r, \\theta) \\mapsto (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)$ from $(a,b)\\times S^1$ (identifying $S^1$ with $\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$).\n\nThe problem allows the use of standard facts about the de Rham cohomology of products with contractible factors. The open interval $(a,b)$ is contractible. A standard result states that if a manifold $P$ is a product $M \\times I$ where $I$ is a contractible space (like an open interval), then the projection $p: M \\times I \\to M$ is a homotopy equivalence. Since de Rham cohomology is a homotopy invariant, we have $H^{k}(M \\times I) \\cong H^{k}(M)$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\nApplying this fact to $U$, $V$, and $U \\cap V$:\n- $U \\cong S^{1} \\times (r_1, t)$, so $H^{k}(U) \\cong H^{k}(S^{1})$.\n- $V \\cong S^{1} \\times (s, r_2)$, so $H^{k}(V) \\cong H^{k}(S^{1})$.\n- $U \\cap V \\cong S^{1} \\times (s, t)$, so $H^{k}(U \\cap V) \\cong H^{k}(S^{1})$.\nSimilarly, the space $A$ itself is an annulus and is homotopy equivalent to $S^{1}$, so $H^{k}(A) \\cong H^{k}(S^{1})$. While this last fact directly gives the answer, the problem requires us to derive it using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.\n\nThe de Rham cohomology groups of the circle $S^{1}$ are well-known:\n- $H^{0}(S^{1}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, since $S^{1}$ is connected. The dimension is $\\dim H^{0}(S^{1}) = 1$.\n- $H^{1}(S^{1}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, generated by the cohomology class of the form $d\\theta$. The dimension is $\\dim H^{1}(S^{1}) = 1$.\n- $H^{k}(S^{1}) = \\{0\\}$ for $k \\ge 2$, since $S^{1}$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold.\n\nThus, for the spaces $U$, $V$, and $U \\cap V$, we have:\n- $\\dim H^{0}(U) = \\dim H^{0}(V) = \\dim H^{0}(U \\cap V) = 1$.\n- $\\dim H^{1}(U) = \\dim H^{1}(V) = \\dim H^{1}(U \\cap V) = 1$.\n- $H^{k}(U) = H^{k}(V) = H^{k}(U \\cap V) = \\{0\\}$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n\nNow we analyze the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. We are interested in $H^1(A)$, so we focus on the segment of the sequence around it:\n$$\n\\dots \\to H^{0}(U) \\oplus H^{0}(V) \\xrightarrow{j^*} H^{0}(U \\cap V) \\xrightarrow{d^*} H^{1}(A) \\xrightarrow{i^*} H^{1}(U) \\oplus H^{1}(V) \\xrightarrow{j^*} H^{1}(U \\cap V) \\to \\dots\n$$\nLet's analyze the maps starting from the $H^0$ part. $H^0(M)$ is the space of locally constant real-valued functions on a manifold $M$. Since $U$, $V$, and $U \\cap V$ are all connected, their $H^0$ groups are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe map $j^*: H^{0}(U) \\oplus H^{0}(V) \\to H^{0}(U \\cap V)$ is given by $j^*((f,g)) = f|_{U \\cap V} - g|_{U \\cap V}$. For constant functions $f(x)=c_1$ and $g(x)=c_2$, this map is $(c_1, c_2) \\mapsto c_1 - c_2$. This map from $\\mathbb{R} \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is surjective. By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of its image is $1$.\nBy exactness of the sequence at $H^{0}(U \\cap V)$, we have $\\ker(d^*) = \\operatorname{Im}(j^*)$. Since $j^*$ is surjective, $\\operatorname{Im}(j^*) = H^{0}(U \\cap V)$. Thus, $\\ker(d^*) = H^{0}(U \\cap V)$, which implies that the connecting homomorphism $d^*: H^{0}(U \\cap V) \\to H^{1}(A)$ is the zero map.\n\nNow consider the sequence at $H^{1}(A)$:\n$$\nH^{0}(U \\cap V) \\xrightarrow{d^*} H^{1}(A) \\xrightarrow{i^*} H^{1}(U) \\oplus H^{1}(V)\n$$\nBy exactness, $\\operatorname{Im}(d^*) = \\ker(i^*)$.

Therefore, $\\ker(i^*) = \\{0\\}$, which means the map $i^*: H^{1}(A) \\to H^{1}(U) \\oplus H^{1}(V)$ is injective.\n\nNext, consider the sequence at $H^{1}(U \\cap V)$:\n$$\nH^{1}(U) \\oplus H^{1}(V) \\xrightarrow{j^*} H^{1}(U \\cap V) \\xrightarrow{d^*} H^{2}(A)\n$$\nThe space $A$ is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to $S^{1}$. Therefore, $H^{2}(A) \\cong H^{2}(S^{1}) = \\{0\\}$. Since the codomain of $d^*: H^{1}(U \\cap V) \\to H^{2}(A)$ is the zero vector space, $d^*$ must be the zero map.\nBy exactness at $H^{1}(U \\cap V)$, we have $\\operatorname{Im}(j^*) = \\ker(d^*)$. Since $d^*$ is the zero map, its kernel is the entire domain, so $\\operatorname{Im}(j^*) = H^{1}(U \\cap V)$. This means the map $j^*: H^{1}(U) \\oplus H^{1}(V) \\to H^{1}(U \\cap V)$ is surjective.\n\nWe have now established that the sequence of vector spaces and linear maps\n$$\n0 \\to H^{1}(A) \\xrightarrow{i^*} H^{1}(U) \\oplus H^{1}(V) \\xrightarrow{j^*} H^{1}(U \\cap V) \\to 0\n$$\nis a short exact sequence.

For any open cover $M = U \\cup V$, exactness forces $\\dim H^0(U\\cap V) = \\dim H^0(U) + \\dim H^0(V) - \\dim H^0(M)$, so $k = c(U) + c(V) - c(M)$ always.**\nThis statement claims that the term $\\dim(\\text{im } \\delta^0)$ in our derived formula is always zero. This is false. A standard counterexample is the circle $M = S^1$. Let $U$ and $V$ be two overlapping open arcs whose union is $S^1$.\n- $M = S^1$ is connected, so $c(M) = 1$.\n- $U$ and $V$ are connected (homeomorphic to open intervals), so $c(U) = 1$ and $c(V) = 1$.\n- $U \\cap V$ consists of two disjoint open intervals, so $k = c(U \\cap V) = 2$.\nAccording to statement A, we should have $k = c(U) + c(V) - c(M)$, which would be $2 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1$. This is a contradiction. The claim is false. In this case, $\\dim(\\text{im } \\delta^0) = k - (c(U) + c(V) - c(M)) = 2 - 1 = 1$. This is consistent with the fact that $\\delta^0: H^0(U \\cap V) \\to H^1(S^1)$ is surjective and $\\dim H^1(S^1) = 1$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. One always has $\\dim H^0(U\\cap V) \\ge \\dim H^0(U) + \\dim H^0(V) - \\dim H^0(M)$, i.e., $k \\ge c(U) + c(V) - c(M)$, with equality if the connecting homomorphism $\\delta^0 : H^0(U\\cap V) \\to H^1(M)$ is the zero map.**\nOur derived formula is $k = c(U) + c(V) - c(M) + \\dim(\\text{im } \\delta^0)$.\nSince the dimension of any vector space is non-negative, $\\dim(\\text{im } \\delta^0) \\ge 0$. This directly implies the inequality:\n$k \\ge c(U) + c(V) - c(M)$.\nEquality holds if and only if $\\dim(\\text{im } \\delta^0) = 0$. This is equivalent to the image of $\\delta^0$ being the trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$, which means that $\\delta^0$ is the zero map. This statement is a direct and accurate consequence of the exact sequence analysis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $H^1(M) = 0$, then $\\dim H^0(U\\cap V) = \\dim H^0(U) + \\dim H^0(V) - \\dim H^0(M)$, so in particular $k = c(U) + c(V) - c(M)$.**\nThe connecting homomorphism is a map $\\delta^0: H^0(U\\cap V) \\to H^1(M)$. If the codomain $H^1(M)$ is the zero vector space ($H^1(M) = 0$), then any linear map into it must be the zero map. Thus, the condition $H^1(M) = 0$ implies that $\\delta^0$ is the zero map.\nFrom the analysis of option B, we know that if $\\delta^0$ is the zero map, then equality holds in the expression for $k$. Therefore, this statement is a valid logical deduction.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. If $U\\cap V$ is connected, then the map $r : H^0(U)\\oplus H^0(V) \\to H^0(U\\cap V)$ is automatically surjective, regardless of $M$, $U$, and $V$.**\nIf $U \\cap V$ is connected, then $k=c(U \\cap V)=1$. Since $U \\cap V$ is non-empty, $H^0(U \\cap V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ is a one-dimensional vector space.\nThe map $r$ is surjective if and only if $\\text{im}(r) = H^0(U \\cap V)$. Since $\\dim H^0(U \\cap V) = 1$, this requires $\\dim(\\text{im } r) = 1$.\nFrom our derivation, $\\dim(\\text{im } r) = c(U) + c(V) - c(M)$.\nSo, the statement claims that if $c(U \\cap V) = 1$, it is always true that $c(U) + c(V) - c(M) = 1$. This is not true.\nConsider a counterexample. Let $M$ be the disjoint union of two tori, $M = T^2 \\sqcup T^2$. Then $c(M) = 2$. Let us construct a cover $M=U \\cup V$ where $U, V, U \\cap V$ are all connected. For instance, embed $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $U$ be a large connected open set containing a piece of each torus and a tube between them. $c(U)=1$. Let $V$ be a similar set covering the remainder of $M$, also connected. $c(V)=1$. We can arrange this so that their intersection $U \\cap V$ is also connected, $c(U \\cap V) = 1$.\nFor this configuration, $\\dim(\\text{im } r) = c(U) + c(V) - c(M) = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0$.\nThe codomain $H^0(U \\cap V)$ has dimension $1$, but the image of $r$ has dimension $0$. Thus, $r$ is not surjective.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{B and C}}$$", "id": "3072134"}]}
