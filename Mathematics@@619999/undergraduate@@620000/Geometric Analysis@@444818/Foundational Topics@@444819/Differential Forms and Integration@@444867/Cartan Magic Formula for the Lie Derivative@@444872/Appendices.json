The given quantities are:\n$$\nX = -y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = x\\,dx + y\\,dy\n$$\nThe Lie derivative, denoted $\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha$, measures the rate of change of the tensor field $\\alpha$ along the flow generated by the vector field $X$. A powerful and fundamental tool for this calculation in the context of exterior calculus is Cartan's \"magic\" formula:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = i_X(d\\alpha) + d(i_X \\alpha)\n$$\nHere, $d$ is the exterior derivative operator and $i_X$ is the interior product operator with respect to the vector field $X$. We will compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, let us compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$, denoted $d\\alpha$. The $1$-form $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = x\\,dx + y\\,dy$. Applying the exterior derivative operator $d$ and using the product rule for differential forms ($d(f\\omega) = df \\wedge \\omega + f d\\omega$) yields:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(x\\,dx + y\\,dy) = d(x) \\wedge dx + x \\wedge d(dx) + d(y) \\wedge dy + y \\wedge d(dy)\n$$\nFor any coordinate function $x^i$, its differential is $d(x^i) = dx^i$. The exterior derivative of any exact form is zero, so $d(dx) = 0$ and $d(dy) = 0$. The wedge product is also alternating, which implies $dx^i \\wedge dx^i = 0$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nd\\alpha = dx \\wedge dx + dy \\wedge dy = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $d\\alpha = 0$, the $1$-form $\\alpha$ is a closed form. The first term in Cartan's formula, $i_X(d\\alpha)$, is thus necessarily zero:\n$$\ni_X(d\\alpha) = i_X(0) = 0\n$$\nNext, we compute the second term, $d(i_X \\alpha)$. This requires first calculating the interior product $i_X \\alpha$. The interior product is the contraction of the $1$-form $\\alpha$ with the vector field $X$, which is a scalar function (a $0$-form) obtained by evaluating $\\alpha$ on $X$:\n$$\ni_X \\alpha = \\alpha(X) = (x\\,dx + y\\,dy)\\left(-y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nThe action of the basis $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$ on the basis vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ is given by the Kronecker delta, $dx^i(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}) = \\delta^i_j$. Applying this bilinearity, we find:\n$$\ni_X \\alpha = x \\cdot dx\\left(-y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) + y \\cdot dy\\left(-y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ni_X \\alpha = x \\left(-y \\cdot dx\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) + x \\cdot dx\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) + y \\left(-y \\cdot dy\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) + x \\cdot dy\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\ni_X \\alpha = x(-y \\cdot 1 + x \\cdot 0) + y(-y \\cdot 0 + x \\cdot 1) = -xy + xy = 0\n$$\nThe interior product $i_X \\alpha$ is the zero function. We now compute its exterior derivative:\n$$\nd(i_X \\alpha) = d(0) = 0\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the results for both terms back into Cartan's formula:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = i_X(d\\alpha) + d(i_X \\alpha) = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Lie derivative is the zero $1$-form.\n\nThis result can be corroborated by a direct appeal to the geometric properties of $X$ and $\\alpha$. The vector field $X = -y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ is the generator of rotations about the origin in the plane. The $1$-form $\\alpha = x\\,dx + y\\,dy$ is an exact form, as it is the differential of the scalar function $f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$. That is, $\\alpha = df$.\nThe Lie derivative of a scalar function $f$ is given by $\\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f)$. Let's compute this quantity:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_X f = \\left(-y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -y(2x) + x(2y) \\right] = -xy+xy=0\n$$\nThe fact that $\\mathcal{L}_X f = 0$ means that the function $f$ is invariant under the flow of $X$. This is geometrically evident: the function $f$ is proportional to the squared distance from the origin, which is constant along the circular flow lines of $X$.\nA fundamental identity states that the Lie derivative and the exterior derivative commute: $\\mathcal{L}_X d = d \\mathcal{L}_X$. Applying this to our context:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = \\mathcal{L}_X(df) = d(\\mathcal{L}_X f)\n$$\nSince we have established that $\\mathcal{L}_X f = 0$, we find:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = d(0) = 0\n$$\nBoth methods conclusively show that the Lie derivative of $\\alpha$ along the vector field $X$ is zero.

The problem asks for a computation using two independent, standard methods and a verification of the results, which is a sound and non-trivial task. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. The task is to compute the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\omega$ in two independent ways.\n\nFirst, we use the flow-based definition of the Lie derivative, which is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\omega = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\,\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega$$\nwhere $\\{\\varphi_{t}\\}$ is the flow of the vector field $X$.\n\nTo apply this definition, we must first determine the flow of $X = \\partial_{z}$. The flow lines, or integral curves, $(x(t), y(t), z(t))$ are the solutions to the system of ordinary differential equations defined by the components of $X$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = 1\n$$\nFor an initial point $(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ at $t=0$, the solution is:\n$$\nx(t) = x_{0} \\\\\ny(t) = y_{0} \\\\\nz(t) = z_{0} + t\n$$\nThus, the flow of $X$ is the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms $\\varphi_{t}: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by:\n$$\\varphi_{t}(x, y, z) = (x, y, z+t)$$\nThis represents a translation along the $z$-axis by a parameter $t$.\n\nNext, we compute the pullback of the $2$-form $\\omega$ by the flow map $\\varphi_{t}$. The form is $\\omega = x\\,dy\\wedge dz$. The pullback $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega$ is computed by substituting the coordinate functions of the map $\\varphi_t$ into $\\omega$:\n$$\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega = (x \\circ \\varphi_{t}) \\, d(y \\circ \\varphi_{t}) \\wedge d(z \\circ \\varphi_{t})$$\nThe compositions of the coordinate functions with the flow are:\n$$\nx \\circ \\varphi_{t}(x, y, z) = x \\\\\ny \\circ \\varphi_{t}(x, y, z) = y \\\\\nz \\circ \\varphi_{t}(x, y, z) = z+t\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the pullback expression:\n$$\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega = x \\, d(y) \\wedge d(z+t)$$\nThe exterior derivative of $y$ is $dy$. The exterior derivative of $z+t$ with respect to the manifold coordinates $(x,y,z)$ is $d(z+t) = dz + d(t) = dz$, since $t$ is a parameter and not a coordinate function on the manifold.\nTherefore, the pullback is:\n$$\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega = x \\, dy \\wedge dz = \\omega$$\nThe pullback of $\\omega$ under the flow of $X$ is simply $\\omega$ itself, which means $\\omega$ is invariant under the flow.\n\nFinally, we compute the Lie derivative by differentiating the pullback with respect to $t$ and evaluating at $t=0$:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\omega = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\,\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\,\\omega$$\nSince the expression for $\\omega=x\\,dy\\wedge dz$ has no explicit dependence on the parameter $t$, its derivative with respect to $t$ is zero.\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\omega = 0$$\n\nSecond, we use Cartan’s magic formula for the Lie derivative of a differential form:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\omega = i_{X}d\\omega + d(i_{X}\\omega)$$\nwhere $i_{X}$ is the interior product with respect to the vector field $X$ and $d$ is the exterior derivative. We compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega = x \\, dy \\wedge dz$$\nUsing the graded Leibniz rule for $d$:\n$$d\\omega = d(x \\, dy \\wedge dz) = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + x \\wedge d(dy \\wedge dz)$$\nThe term $d(dy \\wedge dz)$ is zero because $d^{2}=0$ (specifically, $d(dy \\wedge dz) = d(dy) \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge d(dz) = 0 \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge 0 = 0$).\nSo, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n$$d\\omega = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$$\n\nNext, we compute the interior product $i_{X}d\\omega$. With $X = \\partial_{z}$ and $d\\omega = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$:\n$$i_{X}d\\omega = i_{\\partial_{z}}(dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz)$$\nThe interior product acts on a wedge product of $1$-forms as a graded derivation:\n$$i_{\\partial_{z}}(dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) = (i_{\\partial_{z}}dx) \\, dy \\wedge dz - dx \\wedge (i_{\\partial_{z}}dy) \\, dz + dx \\wedge dy \\, (i_{\\partial_{z}}dz)$$\nBy definition, $i_{V}\\alpha = \\alpha(V)$ for a $1$-form $\\alpha$ and vector field $V$.
