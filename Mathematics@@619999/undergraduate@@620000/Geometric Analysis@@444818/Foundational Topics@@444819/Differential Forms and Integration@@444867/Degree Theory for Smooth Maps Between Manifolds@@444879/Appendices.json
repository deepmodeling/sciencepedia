The formula is:\n$$ \\deg(f) = \\frac{\\int_M f^*\\omega}{\\int_N \\omega} $$\nIn this problem, $M=N=S^1$, which is a $1$-dimensional compact oriented manifold. The top-degree forms are $1$-forms. We are given the $1$-form $\\alpha = -i\\,z^{-1}\\,dz$ on the target manifold $S^1$ and its integral $\\int_{S^1}\\alpha = 2\\pi$. Since the integral is non-zero, $\\alpha$ is a valid choice for $\\omega$.\nThe map is $f_k: S^1 \\to S^1$, so its degree is given by:\n$$ \\deg(f_k) = \\frac{\\int_{S^1} f_k^*\\alpha}{\\int_{S^1}\\alpha} $$\nWe are given $\\int_{S^1}\\alpha = 2\\pi$. Our task is to calculate the numerator, which is the integral of the pullback of $\\alpha$ by $f_k$.\n$$ \\int_{S^1} f_k^*\\alpha $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the suggested parametrization of the source manifold $S^1$ by $\\gamma(t) = e^{it}$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe degree of a smooth map $f: M \\to N$ between two compact, oriented, connected $n$-dimensional manifolds is the unique real number, $\\deg(f)$, that satisfies the relation\n$$ \\int_{M} f^{*}\\eta = \\deg(f)\\int_{N}\\eta $$\nfor any $n$-form $\\eta$ on $N$. In our case, the map is the antipodal map $a: S^n \\to S^n$, and we can use the volume form $\\omega$ of $S^n$ for $\\eta$. The degree is an integer. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\int_{S^n} a^{*}\\omega = \\deg(a)\\int_{S^n}\\omega $$\nSince $\\omega$ is a volume form on an oriented manifold, its integral over the manifold, $\\int_{S^n}\\omega$, represents the volume of $S^n$ and is a non-zero (positive) value. Therefore, we can determine $\\deg(a)$ by finding the constant $c$ such that $a^{*}\\omega = c \\cdot \\omega$. If this relation holds, then $\\deg(a) = c$.\n\nOur primary task is to compute the pullback form $a^{*}\\omega$. The volume form $\\omega$ on $S^n$ is given by $\\omega = \\iota_{\\nu}\\Omega|_{S^{n}}$, where $\\Omega$ is the standard Euclidean volume form on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and $\\nu$ is the outward unit normal vector field on $S^n$. For a point $x \\in S^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the outward unit normal vector is simply the position vector itself, so $\\nu(x) = x$. In standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^0, x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the Euclidean volume form is $\\Omega = dx^0 \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$.\n\nLet's evaluate the pullback $a^*\\omega$ at an arbitrary point $x \\in S^n$. By the definition of the pullback of a differential form, for any set of tangent vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_n \\in T_xS^n$, we have:\n$$ (a^{*}\\omega)_{x}(v_1, \\dots, v_n) = \\omega_{a(x)}((Da)_{x}(v_1), \\dots, (Da)_{x}(v_n)) $$\nThe map is $a(x) = -x$. This is the restriction to $S^n$ of the linear map $A:\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ given by $A(x) = -x$. The differential of $a$ at $x \\in S^n$, $(Da)_x: T_xS^n \\to T_{a(x)}S^n$, is the restriction of the derivative of $A$, which is simply multiplication by $-1$. So, $(Da)_x(v) = -v$ for any $v \\in T_xS^n$.\nSubstituting $a(x)=-x$ and $(Da)_x(v_i) = -v_i$ into the pullback definition, we get:\n$$ (a^{*}\\omega)_{x}(v_1, \\dots, v_n) = \\omega_{-x}(-v_1, \\dots, -v_n) $$\nSince $\\omega_{-x}$ is an $n$-form (an alternating multilinear map on $T_{-x}S^n$), we can factor out the scalars:\n$$ (a^{*}\\omega)_{x}(v_1, \\dots, v_n) = (-1)^n \\omega_{-x}(v_1, \\dots, v_n) $$\nNote that the vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ are in $T_xS^n$, but the form $\\omega_{-x}$ acts on vectors in $T_{-x}S^n$. This expression is not yet fully simplified. Let's revert to the previous step and use the definition of $\\omega$ directly.\n\nThe form $\\omega$ is defined as the interior product $\\iota_{\\nu}\\Omega$ restricted to the tangent bundle of $S^n$. At any point $p \\in S^n$, for tangent vectors $w_1, \\dots, w_n \\in T_pS^n$, the action of $\\omega_p$ is given by:\n$$ \\omega_p(w_1, \\dots, w_n) = (\\iota_{\\nu(p)}\\Omega)_p(w_1, \\dots, w_n) = \\Omega_p(\\nu(p), w_1, \\dots, w_n) $$\nThe form $\\Omega$ is translationally invariant, so $\\Omega_p$ is the same determinant function on $T_p\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for all $p$. With $\\nu(p) = p$, we have:\n$$ \\omega_p(w_1, \\dots, w_n) = \\Omega(p, w_1, \\dots, w_n) $$\nLet's apply this to our expression for the pullback:\n$$ (a^{*}\\omega)_{x}(v_1, \\dots, v_n) = \\omega_{a(x)}((Da)_{x}(v_1), \\dots, (Da)_{x}(v_n)) = \\omega_{-x}(-v_1, \\dots, -v_n) $$\nUsing the definition of $\\omega$ at the point $-x$ with the vectors $-v_1, \\dots, -v_n \\in T_{-x}S^n$:\n$$ \\omega_{-x}(-v_1, \\dots, -v_n) = \\Omega(-x, -v_1, \\dots, -v_n) $$\nThe form $\\Omega$ is an $(n+1)$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. As an alternating multilinear form, we can factor out the scalar $-1$ from each of its $n+1$ arguments (the vectors $-x, -v_1, \\dots, -v_n$):\n$$ \\Omega(-x, -v_1, \\dots, -v_n) = (-1)^{n+1} \\Omega(x, v_1, \\dots, v_n) $$\nNow, we recognize that $\\Omega(x, v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ is precisely the definition of $\\omega_x(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$:\n$$ \\Omega(x, v_1, \\dots, v_n) = \\omega_x(v_1, \\dots, v_n) $$\nCombining these steps, we arrive at the final relationship for the pulled-back form at point $x$:\n$$ (a^{*}\\omega)_{x}(v_1, \\dots, v_n) = (-1)^{n+1} \\omega_x(v_1, \\dots, v_n) $$\nThis equality holds for any set of tangent vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ at any point $x \\in S^n$. Thus, we have established the relationship between the differential forms $a^{*}\\omega$ and $\\omega$:\n$$ a^{*}\\omega = (-1)^{n+1} \\omega $$\nNow we return to the definition of the degree:\n$$ \\int_{S^n} a^{*}\\omega = \\deg(a)\\int_{S^n}\\omega $$\nSubstituting our result for $a^{*}\\omega$:\n$$ \\int_{S^n} (-1)^{n+1} \\omega = \\deg(a)\\int_{S^n}\\omega $$\nSince the constant $(-1)^{n+1}$ can be pulled out of the integral, we have:\n$$ (-1)^{n+1} \\int_{S^n} \\omega = \\deg(a)\\int_{S^n}\\omega $$\nThe integral $\\int_{S^n}\\omega$ is the volume of the $n$-sphere, which is strictly positive. We can therefore divide both sides by this non-zero quantity to find the degree:\n$$ \\deg(a) = (-1)^{n+1} $$\nThis result indicates that the antipodal map is orientation-preserving if $n$ is odd (so $n+1$ is even) and orientation-reversing if $n$ is even (so $n+1$ is odd).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(-1)^{n+1}}\n$$", "id": "3045722"}]}
