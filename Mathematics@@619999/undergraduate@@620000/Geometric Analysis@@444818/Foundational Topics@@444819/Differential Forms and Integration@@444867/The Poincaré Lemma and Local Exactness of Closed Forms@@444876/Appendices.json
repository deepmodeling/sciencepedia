The exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is defined as:\n$$d\\omega = d(P\\,dx+Q\\,dy) = dP\\wedge dx + dQ\\wedge dy$$\nThe differentials of the coefficient functions $P$ and $Q$ are given by:\n$$dP = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} dy$$\n$$dQ = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y} dy$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n$$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} dy\\right) \\wedge dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y} dy\\right) \\wedge dy$$\nUsing the anticommutative property of the wedge product ($dy\\wedge dx = -dx\\wedge dy$) and the property that $dx\\wedge dx = 0$ and $dy\\wedge dy = 0$:\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} (dx\\wedge dx) + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} (dy\\wedge dx) + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} (dx\\wedge dy) + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y} (dy\\wedge dy)$$\n$$d\\omega = 0 + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} (-dx\\wedge dy) + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} (dx\\wedge dy) + 0$$\n$$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) dx\\wedge dy$$\nFor $\\omega$ to be closed, we must have $d\\omega=0$, which requires $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = 0$, or $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}$.\n\nWe are given $P(x,y)=2xy+x+x^{3}$ and $Q(x,y)=x^{2}+2y+y^{3}$. We compute the required partial derivatives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2xy+x+x^{3}) = 2x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^{2}+2y+y^{3}) = 2x$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}$, the condition for $\\omega$ being closed is satisfied. Thus, $d\\omega = (2x - 2x) dx\\wedge dy = 0$, and $\\omega$ is a closed form on $U=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Verification that $df = \\omega$**\n\nThe differential of the function $f(x,y)$ is $df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy$. We need to show that $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = P(x,y)$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = Q(x,y)$. The function $f(x,y)$ is defined as:\n$$f(x,y)=\\int_{0}^{1}\\big(P(tx,ty)\\,x+Q(tx,ty)\\,y\\big)\\,dt$$\nWe use the Leibniz integral rule (differentiation under the integral sign).\n\nFirst, we compute $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{0}^{1} \\big(P(tx,ty)x+Q(tx,ty)y\\big)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\big(P(tx,ty)x+Q(tx,ty)y\\big)\\,dt$$\nApplying the product rule and chain rule to the integrand:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\big(P(tx,ty)x+Q(tx,ty)y\\big) = P(tx,ty) + x\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}(tx,ty) + y\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}(tx,ty)$$\nLet $(\\partial_1 P)$ and $(\\partial_2 P)$ denote the partial derivatives of $P$ with respect to its first and second arguments. The chain rule gives $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}(tx,ty) = (\\partial_1 P)(tx,ty) \\cdot t$. So,\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\big(P(tx,ty)x+Q(tx,ty)y\\big) = P(tx,ty) + xt(\\partial_1 P)(tx,ty) + yt(\\partial_1 Q)(tx,ty)$$\nUsing the fact that $\\omega$ is closed, we have $(\\partial_1 Q) = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = (\\partial_2 P)$. Substituting this into the expression:\n$$P(tx,ty) + xt(\\partial_1 P)(tx,ty) + yt(\\partial_2 P)(tx,ty) = P(tx,ty) + t\\left(x(\\partial_1 P)(tx,ty) + y(\\partial_2 P)(tx,ty)\\right)$$\nNow, consider the total derivative of the function $g(t) = tP(tx,ty)$ with respect to $t$. By the product and chain rules:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\big(tP(tx,ty)\\big) = P(tx,ty) + t\\frac{d}{dt}P(tx,ty)$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}P(tx,ty) = (\\partial_1 P)(tx,ty)\\frac{d(tx)}{dt} + (\\partial_2 P)(tx,ty)\\frac{d(ty)}{dt} = x(\\partial_1 P)(tx,ty) + y(\\partial_2 P)(tx,ty)$$\nSo, $\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = P(tx,ty) + t\\left(x(\\partial_1 P)(tx,ty) + y(\\partial_2 P)(tx,ty)\\right)$. This is exactly the integrand for $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$.\nTherefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC):\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{d}{dt}\\big(tP(tx,ty)\\big)\\,dt = \\big[tP(tx,ty)\\big]_{t=0}^{t=1} = 1\\cdot P(x,y) - 0\\cdot P(0,0) = P(x,y)$$\n\nNext, we compute $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ in a similar manner:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\big(P(tx,ty)x+Q(tx,ty)y\\big)\\,dt$$\nThe integrand's derivative is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\big(P(tx,ty)x+Q(tx,ty)y\\big) = x\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}(tx,ty) + \\left(Q(tx,ty) + y\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y}(tx,ty)\\right)$$\n$$= xt(\\partial_2 P)(tx,ty) + Q(tx,ty) + yt(\\partial_2 Q)(tx,ty)$$\nUsing the closed condition $(\\partial_2 P) = (\\partial_1 Q)$:\n$$xt(\\partial_1 Q)(tx,ty) + Q(tx,ty) + yt(\\partial_2 Q)(tx,ty) = Q(tx,ty) + t\\left(x(\\partial_1 Q)(tx,ty) + y(\\partial_2 Q)(tx,ty)\\right)$$\nThis expression is the total derivative $\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(tQ(tx,ty)\\big)$. Applying the FTC:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{d}{dt}\\big(tQ(tx,ty)\\big)\\,dt = \\big[tQ(tx,ty)\\big]_{t=0}^{t=1} = 1\\cdot Q(x,y) - 0\\cdot Q(0,0) = Q(x,y)$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = P(x,y)$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = Q(x,y)$, we have confirmed that $df = P\\,dx + Q\\,dy = \\omega$.\n\n**Part 3: Explicit computation of $f(x,y)$**\n\nWe compute the integral for $f(x,y)$ using the given expressions for $P$ and $Q$.\nFirst, find the expressions for $P(tx,ty)$ and $Q(tx,ty)$:\n$$P(tx,ty) = 2(tx)(ty) + (tx) + (tx)^{3} = 2t^{2}xy + tx + t^{3}x^{3}$$\n$$Q(tx,ty) = (tx)^{2} + 2(ty) + (ty)^{3} = t^{2}x^{2} + 2ty + t^{3}y^{3}$$\nThe integrand of the integral for $f(x,y)$ is $P(tx,ty)x + Q(tx,ty)y$:\n$$(2t^{2}xy + tx + t^{3}x^{3})x + (t^{2}x^{2} + 2ty + t^{3}y^{3})y$$\n$$= 2t^{2}x^{2}y + tx^{2} + t^{3}x^{4} + t^{2}x^{2}y + 2ty^{2} + t^{3}y^{4}$$\nCombine terms with like powers of $t$:\n$$= t(x^{2} + 2y^{2}) + t^{2}(3x^{2}y) + t^{3}(x^{4} + y^{4})$$\nNow, we integrate this expression with respect to $t$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$f(x,y) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( t(x^{2} + 2y^{2}) + t^{2}(3x^{2}y) + t^{3}(x^{4} + y^{4}) \\right) dt$$\n$$= (x^{2} + 2y^{2})\\int_{0}^{1} t\\,dt + (3x^{2}y)\\int_{0}^{1} t^{2}\\,dt + (x^{4} + y^{4})\\int_{0}^{1} t^{3}\\,dt$$\nThe definite integrals of the powers of $t$ are:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} t\\,dt = \\left[\\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} t^{2}\\,dt = \\left[\\frac{t^{3}}{3}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} t^{3}\\,dt = \\left[\\frac{t^{4}}{4}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSubstituting these values back:\n$$f(x,y) = (x^{2} + 2y^{2})\\frac{1}{2} + (3x^{2}y)\\frac{1}{3} + (x^{4} + y^{4})\\frac{1}{4}$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final closed-form for $f(x,y)$:\n$$f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + y^{2} + x^{2}y + \\frac{1}{4}x^{4} + \\frac{1}{4}y^{4}$$\nRearranging the terms by degree:\n$$f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{4}x^{4} + \\frac{1}{4}y^{4} + x^{2}y + \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + y^{2}$$\nThis is the simplified analytic expression for $f(x,y)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}x^{4} + \\frac{1}{4}y^{4} + x^{2}y + \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + y^{2}}$$", "id": "3074201"}, {"introduction": "The topological requirements of the Poincaré lemma are not mere technicalities; they are essential.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for two things: first, to compute the line integral (circulation) of the $1$-form $\\omega$ around the unit circle $\\gamma$, and second, to use this result to demonstrate that $\\omega$ is not an exact form on its domain, $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Circulation**\n\nThe line integral of a $1$-form $\\omega = P(x,y)\\,dx + Q(x,y)\\,dy$ along a parameterized curve $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ for $t \\in [a,b]$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma} \\omega = \\int_{a}^{b} \\left( P(x(t), y(t)) \\frac{dx}{dt} + Q(x(t), y(t)) \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right) dt\n$$\nIn this problem, the $1$-form is $\\omega = \\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\,dx + \\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\,dy$.\nSo, the component functions are $P(x,y) = \\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ and $Q(x,y) = \\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$.\n\nThe curve is the unit circle, parameterized by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nThus, we have:\n$x(t) = \\cos t$\n$y(t) = \\sin t$\n\nThe derivatives with respect to $t$ are:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\sin t$\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\cos t$\n\nNow, we evaluate the components of $\\omega$ along the path $\\gamma(t)$. A key simplification occurs in the denominator:\n$x(t)^{2} + y(t)^{2} = (\\cos t)^{2} + (\\sin t)^{2} = \\cos^{2}t + \\sin^{2}t = 1$\n\nSubstituting the parameterization into $P$ and $Q$:\n$P(x(t), y(t)) = \\frac{-\\sin t}{\\cos^{2}t + \\sin^{2}t} = \\frac{-\\sin t}{1} = -\\sin t$\n$Q(x(t), y(t)) = \\frac{\\cos t}{\\cos^{2}t + \\sin^{2}t} = \\frac{\\cos t}{1} = \\cos t$\n\nNow, we can assemble the integrand for the line integral:\n$$\nP(x(t), y(t)) \\frac{dx}{dt} + Q(x(t), y(t)) \\frac{dy}{dt} = (-\\sin t)(-\\sin t) + (\\cos t)(\\cos t) = \\sin^{2}t + \\cos^{2}t = 1\n$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma} \\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 1 \\,dt\n$$\nEvaluating this simple integral, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 1 \\,dt = [t]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi\n$$\nThe circulation of the vector field $X$ around $\\gamma$, which is the line integral $\\int_{\\gamma}\\omega$, is $2\\pi$.\n\n**Part 2: Argument for Non-Exactness**\n\nWe first recall the definitions of closed and exact forms and a key theorem.\n\n1.  **Closed Form:** A $1$-form $\\omega = P\\,dx + Q\\,dy$ is defined as **closed** if its exterior derivative is zero, $d\\omega = 0$. For a $1$-form in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, this condition is equivalent to $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}$. Let's verify this for the given $\\omega$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(-1)(x^{2}+y^{2}) - (-y)(2y)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{-x^{2}-y^{2}+2y^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}$\n    $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(x^{2}+y^{2}) - (x)(2x)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}-2x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}$\n    Since $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}$, the form $\\omega$ is indeed closed on its domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\n2.  **Exact Form:** A $1$-form $\\omega$ is defined as **exact** on a domain $U$ if there exists a scalar function (a $0$-form) $f: U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\omega = df$. The function $f$ is called a potential function for $\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals:** A direct consequence of a form being exact is that its integral over any closed path $C$ within its domain is zero. If $\\omega = df$ and $C$ is a closed loop parameterized by $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ for $t \\in [a,b]$ (so $\\mathbf{r}(a) = \\mathbf{r}(b)$), then:\n    $$\n    \\int_{C} \\omega = \\int_{C} df = f(\\mathbf{r}(b)) - f(\\mathbf{r}(a)) = 0\n    $$\n\nNow, we can construct the argument.\n-   The path of integration, $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, is a closed curve because its start and end points are the same: $\\gamma(0) = (1,0)$ and $\\gamma(2\\pi) = (1,0)$.\n-   This closed curve $\\gamma$ lies entirely within the domain of $\\omega$, which is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n-   We computed the line integral of $\\omega$ along this closed curve $\\gamma$ and found the result to be $2\\pi$.\n-   Since $\\int_{\\gamma}\\omega = 2\\pi \\neq 0$, this directly contradicts the necessary condition for $\\omega$ to be an exact form.\n-   Therefore, we must conclude that there is no scalar function $f$ defined on the entire domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ for which $\\omega = df$.\n\nIn conclusion, although the form $\\omega$ is closed on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, our calculation $\\int_{\\gamma}\\omega = 2\\pi$ proves that it cannot be exact on this domain. This illustrates that the property of a closed form being exact depends on the topology of the domain; specifically, $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ is not simply connected (it has a hole), which allows for the existence of closed but not exact forms.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\pi}\n$$", "id": "3074249"}, {"introduction": "The deep connection between a domain's topology and the exactness of closed forms extends to higher dimensions and forms of higher degree.

We compute the divergence-like term $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z}$.\n\nLet's compute $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}$. Using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{r^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{(1)(r^3) - x(3r^2\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x})}{r^6}\n$$\nSince $r^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2$, differentiating with respect to $x$ gives $2r\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x} = 2x$, so $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x} = \\frac{x}{r}$. Substituting this in:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{r^3 - x(3r^2 \\frac{x}{r})}{r^6} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{r^3 - 3x^2r}{r^6} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{r^2 - 3x^2}{r^5}\n$$\nSubstituting $r^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{(x^2+y^2+z^2) - 3x^2}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{y^2+z^2-2x^2}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}\n$$\nBy the symmetry of the expressions for $f_1, f_2, f_3$, the other partial derivatives are obtained by cyclic permutation of the variables $(x,y,z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{x^2+z^2-2y^2}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{x^2+y^2-2z^2}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}\n$$\nNow, we sum these derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}} \\left( (y^2+z^2-2x^2) + (x^2+z^2-2y^2) + (x^2+y^2-2z^2) \\right)\n$$\nThe sum in the numerator is:\n$$\n(y^2-2y^2+y^2) + (z^2+z^2-2z^2) + (-2x^2+x^2+x^2) = 0+0+0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the coefficient of $dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz$ is zero for all $(x,y,z) \\in U$. This means $d\\omega = 0$ on $U$, so $\\omega$ is closed.\n\n**Part 2: Computing the integral $I = \\int_{S^2} \\omega$**\n\nThe unit sphere is defined by $S^2 = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2+y^2+z^2=1\\}$. The integral of the $2$-form $\\omega$ over the surface $S^2$ is computed by parameterizing the surface and pulling back the form. We use the standard spherical coordinates parameterization for the unit sphere:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\phi, \\theta) = (x(\\phi, \\theta), y(\\phi, \\theta), z(\\phi, \\theta)) = (\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta, \\cos\\phi)\n$$\nwith the domain $D = [0, \\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ for $(\\phi, \\theta)$. On the surface of $S^2$, the term $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$, so the denominator in $\\omega$ becomes $(1)^{3/2}=1$. The restriction of $\\omega$ to $S^2$ is:\n$$\n\\omega|_{S^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}(x\\,dy\\wedge dz + y\\,dz\\wedge dx + z\\,dx\\wedge dy)\n$$\nThe integral is $I = \\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_{D} \\Phi^*(\\omega|_{S^2})$. To find the pullback $\\Phi^*(\\omega|_{S^2})$, we compute the differentials of the coordinate functions:\n$$\ndx = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\phi}d\\phi + \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta = \\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\phi - \\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\n$$\n$$\ndy = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\phi}d\\phi + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta = \\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\phi + \\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta\n$$\n$$\ndz = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\phi}d\\phi + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta = -\\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi\n$$\nNext, we compute the pullbacks of the basis $2$-forms:\n$$\n\\Phi^*(dy\\wedge dz) = (\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\phi + \\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta) \\wedge (-\\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi) = (\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta)\\wedge(-\\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi) = \\sin^2\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi^*(dz\\wedge dx) = (-\\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi) \\wedge (\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\phi - \\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta) = (-\\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi)\\wedge(-\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta) = \\sin^2\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi^*(dx\\wedge dy) = (\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\phi - \\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta) \\wedge (\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta\\,d\\phi + \\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta) = (\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta)(\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta)d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta - (\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta)(\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta)d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi = (\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi\\sin^2\\theta)d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta = \\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi\\,d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta\n$$\nThe orientation given by $d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta$ corresponds to the outward normal, which is the required orientation. Now we substitute these into the pullback of $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\Phi^*(\\omega|_{S^2}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left( x\\,\\Phi^*(dy\\wedge dz) + y\\,\\Phi^*(dz\\wedge dx) + z\\,\\Phi^*(dx\\wedge dy) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4\\pi} [ (\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta)(\\sin^2\\phi\\cos\\theta) + (\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta)(\\sin^2\\phi\\sin\\theta) + (\\cos\\phi)(\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi) ] d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4\\pi} [ \\sin^3\\phi(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta) + \\sin\\phi\\cos^2\\phi ] d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4\\pi} [ \\sin^3\\phi + \\sin\\phi\\cos^2\\phi ] d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\sin\\phi(\\sin^2\\phi+\\cos^2\\phi) d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi\\wedge d\\theta\n$$\nNow we compute the integral over the parameter domain $D=[0, \\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$:\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi\\,d\\theta = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\phi\\,d\\phi \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4\\pi} (2\\pi) \\left( [-\\cos\\phi]_{0}^{\\pi} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (-\\cos\\pi) - (-\\cos0) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -(-1) - (-1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 1\n$$\nThe value of the integral is $I=1$.\n\n**Part 3: Deciding if $\\omega$ is globally exact**\n\nA differential form $\\omega$ is globally exact on a domain $U$ if there exists a form $\\alpha$ of one less degree, defined on all of $U$, such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$. In our case, this would mean there is a $1$-form $\\alpha$ on $U = \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$.\n\nWe use Stokes' theorem, which states that for any $(k-1)$-form $\\alpha$ and any compact, oriented $k$-dimensional manifold-with-boundary $M$, we have $\\int_{M} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial M} \\alpha$.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\omega$ is globally exact on $U$. Then there exists a $1$-form $\\alpha$ on $U$ such that $\\omega=d\\alpha$. The unit sphere $S^2$ is a $2$-dimensional, compact, oriented manifold contained in $U$. Vitally, $S^2$ has no boundary, i.e., $\\partial S^2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nApplying Stokes' theorem to our situation:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_{S^2} d\\alpha\n$$\nBy Stokes' theorem, this must be equal to the integral of $\\alpha$ over the boundary of $S^2$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial S^2} \\alpha = \\int_{\\emptyset} \\alpha = 0\n$$\nThus, if $\\omega$ were globally exact on $U$, its integral over the closed surface $S^2$ must be zero.\n\nHowever, in Part 2, we computed this integral and found that:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} \\omega = 1\n$$\nSince $1 \\neq 0$, we have a contradiction. Our initial assumption that $\\omega$ is globally exact on $U$ must be false.\n\nIn conclusion, $\\omega$ is a closed form ($d\\omega=0$) but it is not exact on $U=\\mathbb{R}^3\\setminus\\{0\\}$. This is a classic example illustrating that the Poincaré lemma (which guarantees that closed forms are exact) does not hold on domains that are not contractible (like $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with a point removed).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3074252"}]}
