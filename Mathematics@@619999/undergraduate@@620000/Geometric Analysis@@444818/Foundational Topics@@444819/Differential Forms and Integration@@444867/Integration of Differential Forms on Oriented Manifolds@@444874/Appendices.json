If a $k$-form $\\alpha$ is exact on a domain containing $C$, say $\\alpha = d\\eta$, then according to Stokes' Theorem:\n$$ \\int_C \\alpha = \\int_C d\\eta = \\int_{\\partial C} \\eta $$\nSince $C$ is a closed manifold, its boundary $\\partial C$ is the empty set. The integral over an empty set is defined to be $0$. Therefore, $\\int_C \\alpha = 0$.\n\nIn our problem, $S^1$ is a $1$-dimensional closed manifold. If $\\omega$ were exact on $S^1$, then $\\omega=df$ for some function $f:S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and its integral over $S^1$ would have to be zero.\nTo see this explicitly using our parametrization:\n$$ \\int_{S^1} df = \\int_{[0, 2\\pi]} \\gamma^*(df) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d(\\gamma^*f) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d(f(\\gamma(t))) $$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d}{dt}(f(\\gamma(t)))\\,dt = f(\\gamma(2\\pi)) - f(\\gamma(0)) $$\nSince $\\gamma(2\\pi) = (\\cos(2\\pi), \\sin(2\\pi)) = (1,0)$ and $\\gamma(0) = (\\cos(0), \\sin(0)) = (1,0)$, we have $\\gamma(2\\pi) = \\gamma(0)$. Thus,\n$$ \\int_{S^1} df = f(1,0) - f(1,0) = 0 $$\nThis shows that the integral of any exact $1$-form over $S^1$ must be $0$.\n\nHowever, in Part 2 we computed $\\int_{S^1} \\omega = 2\\pi$. Since\n$$ \\int_{S^1} \\omega = 2\\pi \\neq 0 $$\nthis result contradicts the necessary condition for $\\omega$ to be exact. Therefore, we must conclude that $\\omega$ is not an exact form on $S^1$.\n\nThis demonstrates a fundamental concept: $\\omega$ is a closed form that is not exact. The existence of such a form indicates that the manifold $S^1$ has non-trivial topology, specifically, a non-trivial first de Rham cohomology group $H^1_{dR}(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the integral.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi}$$", "id": "3053504"}]}
