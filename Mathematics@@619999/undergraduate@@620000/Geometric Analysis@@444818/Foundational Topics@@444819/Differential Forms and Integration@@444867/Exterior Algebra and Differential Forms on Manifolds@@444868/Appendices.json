Let the function $f$ be the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$\nf(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}} = (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{-1}.\n$$\nAnd let the $1$-form $\\alpha$ be the numerator:\n$$\n\\alpha = x\\,dx+y\\,dy+z\\,dz.\n$$\nThen, $\\omega$ can be written as the product $\\omega = f\\alpha$. The function $f$ is smooth on $M$ since its denominator $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ is non-zero on $M$. The form $\\alpha$ is smooth everywhere.\n\nWe apply the exterior derivative to this product using the graded Leibniz rule for a $0$-form $f$ and a $k$-form $\\alpha$, which is $d(f\\alpha) = df\\wedge\\alpha + f\\,d\\alpha$. In our case, $\\alpha$ is a $1$-form.\n$$\nd\\omega = d(f\\alpha) = df \\wedge \\alpha + f\\,d\\alpha.\n$$\nWe must compute the two terms $df$ and $d\\alpha$ separately.\n\nFirst, we compute $df$. The function is $f = (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{-1}$.

The exterior derivative of a coordinate differential $dx$ is $d(dx) = d(d(x))$. Since $d\\circ d=0$, we have $d(dx) = 0$.
