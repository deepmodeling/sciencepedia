The $2$-form $dx^{1} \\wedge dx^{2}$ represents an infinitesimal element of oriented area in the source space $U$. The map $F$ transforms this infinitesimal area element at $(x^{1}, x^{2})$ into a corresponding infinitesimal area element in the target space. The scalar factor $\\det(J_F) = 2x^{1}\\exp(x^{2}) + 1$ is precisely the ratio of the oriented area of the transformed element to the oriented area of the original element.
