Since we have computed $d\\alpha = 0$, the $1$-form $\\alpha$ is closed on its domain $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nA differential $k$-form $\\omega$ is defined as **exact** if there exists a $(k-1)$-form $\\beta$ such that $\\omega = d\\beta$. For our $1$-form $\\alpha$, it would be exact if there existed a $0$-form (a scalar function) $h(x, y)$ such that $\\alpha = dh$.\n\nIf $\\alpha$ were exact on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, then by the generalized Stokes' theorem, the integral of $\\alpha$ over any closed curve $C$ in the domain must be zero. Let's test this by integrating $\\alpha$ over the unit circle $C$ centered at the origin, which lies entirely within $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We can parameterize $C$ by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nOn this curve, we have $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. The differentials are $dx = -\\sin t \\, dt$ and $dy = \\cos t \\, dt$. Also, $x^2+y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nThe pullback of $\\alpha$ to the curve $C$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma^*\\alpha = \\frac{-\\sin t}{1}(-\\sin t \\, dt) + \\frac{\\cos t}{1}(\\cos t \\, dt) = (\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t)dt = 1 \\, dt.\n$$\nThe line integral is then\n$$\n\\oint_C \\alpha = \\int_0^{2\\pi} 1 \\, dt = 2\\pi.\n$$\nSince $\\oint_C \\alpha = 2\\pi \\neq 0$, the form $\\alpha$ cannot be exact on the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. If it were, i.e., $\\alpha=dh$, the integral would have to be $h(\\gamma(2\\pi)) - h(\\gamma(0)) = h(1,0) - h(1,0) = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\alpha$ is a closed but not exact form on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Consistency with $d^2=0$ and Topology:**\nThe property $d^2=0$ implies that any exact form is necessarily closed. If $\\omega = d\\beta$, then $d\\omega = d(d\\beta) = d^2\\beta = 0$. Our result does not contradict this. We have a closed form that is not exact. This means the converse implication (\"closed $\\implies$ exact\") is not true in general.\n\nThe validity of the converse statement depends crucially on the topology of the domain. Poincaré's lemma states that on a contractible domain (e.g., a star-shaped domain like $\\mathbb{R}^2$ itself), every closed form is exact. The domain in this problem, $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, is not contractible. It has a \"hole\" at the origin and is homotopy equivalent to a circle $S^1$. The existence of this topological hole is precisely what allows for the existence of closed forms that are not exact. The form $\\alpha$ \"detects\" this hole, as evidenced by its non-zero integral around it. This phenomenon is formalized by de Rham cohomology, where the space of closed forms modulo exact forms, $H^1_{dR}(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\})$, is non-trivial. Our result shows that the cohomology class $[\\alpha]$ is a non-zero element of this space.\n\nIn summary, the calculation $d\\alpha=0$ shows $\\alpha$ is closed. The calculation $\\oint_C \\alpha \\neq 0$ shows $\\alpha$ is not exact. This is consistent with $d^2=0$ and highlights that the implication \"closed $\\implies$ exact\" holds only on domains with trivial topology (in the relevant dimension), which $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is not.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3078607"}, {"introduction": "Differential forms are not just static objects on a single manifold; they can be transported between manifolds via smooth maps using an operation called the pullback.

The general theory of differential forms establishes that the exterior derivative operator $d$ and the pullback map $F^*$ commute, meaning $d(F^*\\omega) = F^*(d\\omega)$ for any differential form $\\omega$. The calculation will serve as a verification of this fundamental theorem for the specific case given.\n\nFirst, we compute the term $F^{*}(d\\alpha)$.\nThe $1$-form on the target space is $\\alpha = u\\,dv$. We compute its exterior derivative $d\\alpha$. Using the graded Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative, $d(\\omega \\wedge \\eta) = d\\omega \\wedge \\eta + (-1)^p \\omega \\wedge d\\eta$ for a $p$-form $\\omega$, where here $u$ is a $0$-form, we have:\n$$d\\alpha = d(u\\,dv) = du \\wedge dv$$\nNow, we pull this $2$-form back to the source space via the map $F$. The pullback $F^*$ commutes with the wedge product, so $F^{*}(du \\wedge dv) = F^{*}(du) \\wedge F^{*}(dv)$. The pullback of an exact form is the exact form of the pullback, so $F^*(du) = d(F^*u) = d(u \\circ F)$ and $F^*(dv) = d(F^*v) = d(v \\circ F)$.\nThe pullback of the coordinate functions $u$ and $v$ are their compositions with $F$:\n$$F^*u = u(x,y) = x^2+y$$\n$$F^*v = v(x,y) = x\\exp(y)$$\nWe now compute the differentials of these pulled-back functions (which are now $0$-forms on the source space):\n$$F^{*}(du) = d(x^2+y) = \\frac{\\partial(x^2+y)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial(x^2+y)}{\\partial y}dy = 2x\\,dx + dy$$\n$$F^{*}(dv) = d(x\\exp(y)) = \\frac{\\partial(x\\exp(y))}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial(x\\exp(y))}{\\partial y}dy = \\exp(y)\\,dx + x\\exp(y)\\,dy$$\nNext, we compute the wedge product to find $F^{*}(d\\alpha)$:\n$$F^{*}(d\\alpha) = (2x\\,dx + dy) \\wedge (\\exp(y)\\,dx + x\\exp(y)\\,dy)$$\nUsing the bilinearity and anticommutativity of the wedge product (i.e., $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, and $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$):\n$$F^{*}(d\\alpha) = (2x\\,dx) \\wedge (x\\exp(y)\\,dy) + (dy) \\wedge (\\exp(y)\\,dx)$$\n$$F^{*}(d\\alpha) = 2x^2\\exp(y)\\,(dx \\wedge dy) + \\exp(y)\\,(dy \\wedge dx)$$\n$$F^{*}(d\\alpha) = 2x^2\\exp(y)\\,(dx \\wedge dy) - \\exp(y)\\,(dx \\wedge dy)$$\n$$F^{*}(d\\alpha) = (2x^2\\exp(y) - \\exp(y))\\,dx \\wedge dy = (2x^2 - 1)\\exp(y)\\,dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nSecond, we compute the term $d(F^{*}\\alpha)$.\nFirst, we find the pullback of $\\alpha$ itself. The rule for pulling back a product of a $0$-form $f$ and a $k$-form $\\omega$ is $F^{*}(f\\omega) = (f \\circ F) F^{*}\\omega$. Here, $f=u$ and $\\omega=dv$.\n$$F^{*}\\alpha = F^{*}(u\\,dv) = (u \\circ F) F^{*}(dv)$$\nWe have already computed $u \\circ F = x^2+y$ and $F^{*}(dv) = \\exp(y)\\,dx + x\\exp(y)\\,dy$.\nSo, the pullback of $\\alpha$ is the $1$-form on the source space:\n$$F^{*}\\alpha = (x^2+y)(\\exp(y)\\,dx + x\\exp(y)\\,dy)$$\n$$F^{*}\\alpha = (x^2\\exp(y) + y\\exp(y))\\,dx + (x^3\\exp(y) + xy\\exp(y))\\,dy$$\nNow we compute the exterior derivative of this $1$-form. Let $F^{*}\\alpha = P(x,y)\\,dx + Q(x,y)\\,dy$, where $P(x,y) = x^2\\exp(y) + y\\exp(y)$ and $Q(x,y) = x^3\\exp(y) + xy\\exp(y)$. The exterior derivative is given by $d(F^{*}\\alpha) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy$.\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3\\exp(y) + xy\\exp(y)) = (3x^2 + y)\\exp(y)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2\\exp(y) + y\\exp(y)) = x^2\\exp(y) + (1\\cdot\\exp(y) + y\\cdot\\exp(y)) = (x^2+1+y)\\exp(y)$$\nSubtracting the two gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = (3x^2 + y)\\exp(y) - (x^2+y+1)\\exp(y)$$\n$$= (3x^2 + y - x^2 - y - 1)\\exp(y) = (2x^2 - 1)\\exp(y)$$\nThus, the exterior derivative is:\n$$d(F^{*}\\alpha) = (2x^2 - 1)\\exp(y)\\,dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $d(F^{*}\\alpha)-F^{*}(d\\alpha)$:\n$$d(F^{*}\\alpha)-F^{*}(d\\alpha) = (2x^2 - 1)\\exp(y)\\,dx \\wedge dy - (2x^2 - 1)\\exp(y)\\,dx \\wedge dy = 0$$\nThe explicit computation shows that the two forms are identical, and their difference is the zero $2$-form. This confirms the general theorem $dF^* = F^*d$. The fact that $d^2=0$ ensures the exterior derivative operator is a component of a cochain complex, which is a foundational structure in this theory, but it was not directly needed for this specific computation, which deals with forms of degree $0$, $1$, and $2$.\n\nFor the interpretation, we consider the Jacobian matrix of the transformation $F(x,y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y))$:\n$$J_F = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & 1 \\\\ \\exp(y) & x\\exp(y) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\\det(J_F) = (2x)(x\\exp(y)) - (1)(\\exp(y)) = 2x^2\\exp(y) - \\exp(y) = (2x^2 - 1)\\exp(y)$$\nA fundamental result in the theory of differential forms is that the pullback of a top-degree form (the volume form) is equal to the original volume form multiplied by the determinant of the Jacobian of the map. In our case, $du \\wedge dv$ is the volume form on the target space $\\mathbb{R}^2(u,v)$, and $dx \\wedge dy$ is the volume form on the source space $\\mathbb{R}^2(x,y)$. The transformation rule is:\n$$F^{*}(du \\wedge dv) = \\det(J_F) \\,dx \\wedge dy$$\nLet's verify this with our computation of $F^{*}(d\\alpha) = F^{*}(du \\wedge dv)$:\n$$F^{*}(du \\wedge dv) = (2x^2 - 1)\\exp(y)\\,dx \\wedge dy$$\nWe see that the coefficient is precisely $\\det(J_F)$. The equality $d(F^{*}\\alpha)=F^{*}(d\\alpha)$ can now be interpreted. The right side, $F^{*}(d\\alpha) = F^{*}(du \\wedge dv)$, represents the direct transformation of the area element from the target space to the source space, which is scaled by the Jacobian determinant. The left side, $d(F^{*}\\alpha)$, represents a different procedure: first, pull back the $1$-form $\\alpha$ to the source space to get $F^*\\alpha$, then take its exterior derivative. The commutation theorem $dF^*=F^*d$ guarantees that these two seemingly different procedures yield the exact same result.

The normal vector to the surface for this parameterization is given by the cross product of the partial derivatives:\n$\\mathbf{r}_x = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial x} = (1, 0, -2x)$\n$\\mathbf{r}_y = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial y} = (0, 1, -2y)$\n$\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{r}_x \\times \\mathbf{r}_y = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1 & 0 & -2x \\\\ 0 & 1 & -2y \\end{pmatrix} = (2x)\\mathbf{i} - (-2y)\\mathbf{j} + (1)\\mathbf{k} = (2x, 2y, 1)$\nSince the $z$-component of $\\mathbf{N}$ is $1 > 0$, this normal vector is upward-pointing, and our parameterization has the correct orientation.\n\nThe surface integral $\\int_{\\Sigma} d\\alpha$ can be computed by pulling back $d\\alpha$ to the parameter domain $D$. For a $2$-form $\\omega = F_1 \\, dy \\wedge dz + F_2 \\, dz \\wedge dx + F_3 \\, dx \\wedge dy$ and a surface parameterized by $\\mathbf{r}(x,y)$ with normal vector $\\mathbf{N}=(N_x, N_y, N_z)$, the integral is $\\int_D (F_1 N_x + F_2 N_y + F_3 N_z) \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFrom $d\\alpha$, we have the coefficients $F_1 = 2y-x$, $F_2 = -2x$, and $F_3 = z-1$. The normal vector is $\\mathbf{N} = (2x, 2y, 1)$. The integrand is:\n$$ (2y-x)(2x) + (-2x)(2y) + (z-1)(1) = 4xy - 2x^{2} - 4xy + z - 1 = -2x^{2} + z - 1 $$\nOn the surface $\\Sigma$, we have $z = 2 - x^{2} - y^{2}$. Substituting this into the integrand:\n$$ -2x^{2} + (2 - x^{2} - y^{2}) - 1 = 1 - 3x^{2} - y^{2} $$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} \\alpha = \\int_{\\Sigma} d\\alpha = \\iint_D (1 - 3x^{2} - y^{2}) \\, dx \\, dy $$\nThe domain of integration $D$ is the unit disk. It is advantageous to switch to polar coordinates:\n$x = r \\cos \\theta$\n$y = r \\sin \\theta$\n$dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\nThe limits of integration are $r \\in [0, 1]$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The integrand in polar coordinates is:\n$1 - 3(r \\cos \\theta)^{2} - (r \\sin \\theta)^{2} = 1 - 3r^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta - r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta = 1 - r^{2}(3\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta)$.\n\nThe integral is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(1 - r^{2}(3\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta)\\right) r \\, dr \\, d\\theta $$\n$$ = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(r - r^{3}(3\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta)\\right) \\, dr \\, d\\theta $$\nIntegrate with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(r - r^{3}(3\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta)\\right) \\, dr = \\left[ \\frac{r^{2}}{2} - \\frac{r^{4}}{4}(3\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta) \\right]_{0}^{1} $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}(3\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta) $$\nNow, integrate with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{4}\\cos^{2}\\theta - \\frac{1}{4}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\right) d\\theta $$\nWe use the identities $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^{2}\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\pi$ and $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin^{2}\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\pi$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2} \\, d\\theta - \\frac{3}{4} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^{2}\\theta \\, d\\theta - \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin^{2}\\theta \\, d\\theta $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi) - \\frac{3}{4}(\\pi) - \\frac{1}{4}(\\pi) = \\pi - \\frac{3\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\pi - \\pi = 0 $$\nAlternatively, we can combine the trigonometric terms before integrating:\n$3\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta = 2\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta = 2\\cos^{2}\\theta + 1$.\nUsing $\\cos^{2}\\theta = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, this becomes $2(\\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}) + 1 = 1+\\cos(2\\theta) + 1 = 2+\\cos(2\\theta)$.\nThe integral with respect to $\\theta$ becomes:\n$$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}(2+\\cos(2\\theta)) \\right) d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(2\\theta) \\right) d\\theta = -\\frac{1}{4} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(2\\theta) d\\theta $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2} \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = -\\frac{1}{8} (\\sin(4\\pi) - \\sin(0)) = 0 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
