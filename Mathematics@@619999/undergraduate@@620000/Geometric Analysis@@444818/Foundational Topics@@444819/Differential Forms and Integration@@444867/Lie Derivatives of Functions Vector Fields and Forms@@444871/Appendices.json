It is a standard, well-posed problem in differential geometry. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe Lie derivative of a smooth function $f$ along a smooth vector field $X$, denoted $L_{X}f$, can be defined in terms of the flow of $X$. Let $\\phi_{t}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the flow generated by the vector field $X$. The flow $\\phi_{t}(p)$ describes the position at time $t$ of a particle that starts at point $p$ at time $t=0$ and moves along the integral curve of $X$. The Lie derivative of $f$ at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is then given by the rate of change of $f$ along this curve at $t=0$:\n$$\n(L_{X}f)(p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(\\phi_{t}(p))\n$$\n\nFirst, we must compute the flow $\\phi_{t}$ of the vector field $X = x^{1}\\partial_{1}$. An integral curve $\\gamma(t) = (x^{1}(t), \\dots, x^{n}(t))$ of $X$ must satisfy the system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma(t)}{dt} = X_{\\gamma(t)}\n$$\nIn coordinates, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dx^{i}(t)}{dt} = X^{i}(\\gamma(t))\n$$\nFor the given vector field $X = x^{1}\\partial_{1}$, the components are $X^{1} = x^{1}$ and $X^{i} = 0$ for $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$. The system of ODEs is therefore:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dx^{1}}{dt} &= x^{1} \\\\\n\\frac{dx^{i}}{dt} &= 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}\n\\end{align*}\nLet the initial point at $t=0$ be $p = (p^{1}, \\dots, p^{n})$. We solve this system with the initial conditions $x^{i}(0) = p^{i}$.\n\nThe first equation, $\\frac{dx^{1}}{dt} = x^{1}$, is a separable first-order linear ODE. Its solution is $x^{1}(t) = C e^{t}$ for some constant $C$. Using the initial condition $x^{1}(0) = p^{1}$, we find $p^{1} = C e^{0}$, which implies $C=p^{1}$. Thus, the solution is:\n$$\nx^{1}(t) = p^{1}e^{t}\n$$\nThe remaining equations, $\\frac{dx^{i}}{dt} = 0$ for $i \\geq 2$, integrate to $x^{i}(t) = \\text{constant}$. Using the initial conditions $x^{i}(0) = p^{i}$, we find that the constant is $p^{i}$. Thus:\n$$\nx^{i}(t) = p^{i} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}\n$$\nThe flow $\\phi_{t}$ maps the starting point $p$ to the point on the integral curve at time $t$. Therefore, the flow is given by:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}(p^{1}, \\dots, p^{n}) = (p^{1}e^{t}, p^{2}, \\dots, p^{n})\n$$\nTo make the notation consistent with the problem statement, we use $x = (x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ as the arbitrary point in the manifold instead of $p$. The flow is $\\phi_{t}(x) = (x^{1}e^{t}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n})$.\n\nNow we can compute the Lie derivative $L_{X}f$. We evaluate the function $f(x)=x^{1}x^{2}$ along the flow:\n$$\nf(\\phi_{t}(x)) = f(x^{1}e^{t}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n})\n$$\nAccording to the definition of $f$, this becomes:\n$$\nf(\\phi_{t}(x)) = (x^{1}e^{t})x^{2} = x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}\n$$\nNext, we differentiate this expression with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} f(\\phi_{t}(x)) = \\frac{d}{dt} (x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}) = x^{1}x^{2} \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{t}) = x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$\n(L_{X}f)(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(\\phi_{t}(x)) = x^{1}x^{2}e^{0} = x^{1}x^{2}\n$$\nThus, the Lie derivative of $f(x)=x^{1}x^{2}$ along the vector field $X=x^{1}\\partial_{1}$ is the function $x^{1}x^{2}$.\n\nIt is useful to note that for a scalar function, the Lie derivative is equivalent to the directional derivative: $L_{X}f = X(f)$. We can verify our result using this alternative definition:\n$$\nL_{X}f = X(f) = (x^{1}\\partial_{1})(x^{1}x^{2}) = x^{1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}(x^{1}x^{2})\\right) = x^{1}(1 \\cdot x^{2}) = x^{1}x^{2}\n$$\nThe result is consistent.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation:**\nThe Lie derivative $L_{X}f$ at a point $x$ measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function $f$ as one moves away from $x$ along the integral curve of the vector field $X$. The integral curves of $X=x^{1}\\partial_{1}$ are trajectories where particles move parallel to the $x^1$-axis with a velocity proportional to their $x^1$-coordinate. Points on the hyperplane $x^{1}=0$ are fixed points. Points with $x^{1}>0$ move in the positive $x^{1}$ direction, and points with $x^{1}<0$ move in the negative $x^{1}$ direction, both accelerating away from the $x^{1}=0$ hyperplane.\n\nOur result, $L_{X}f = x^{1}x^{2}$, shows that the rate of change of the function $f$ along these flow lines is equal to the value of the function $f$ itself. This implies an exponential-like behavior for the value of $f$ along an integral curve. Let $g(t) = f(\\phi_{t}(x))$ be the value of $f$ along the flow line starting at $x$. We found that $\\frac{dg}{dt} \\Big|_{t=0} = (L_{X}f)(x) = f(x) = g(0)$. More generally, at any point $\\gamma(t) = \\phi_t(x)$ along the curve, the rate of change is $\\frac{dg}{dt} (t) = (L_X f)(\\gamma(t))$. In our case, $(L_X f)(\\gamma(t)) = (x^1e^t)(x^2) = f(\\gamma(t)) = g(t)$. So we have the differential equation $\\frac{dg}{dt} = g(t)$, whose solution is $g(t) = g(0) e^t$. This means the value of the function $f$ grows or decays exponentially along the flow lines of $X$, and the rate of this change at any point is simply the value of the function at that point.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^{1}x^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3056207"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from functions to vector fields.

Since component functions commute ($X^j Y^k = Y^k X^j$) and partial derivatives on a coordinate chart commute ($\\partial_j \\partial_k f = \\partial_k \\partial_j f$), these terms cancel out:\n$$X^j Y^k \\partial_j \\partial_k f - Y^k X^j \\partial_k \\partial_j f = X^j Y^k (\\partial_j \\partial_k f - \\partial_k \\partial_j f) = 0$$\nWe are left with:\n$$[X, Y](f) = (X^j \\partial_j Y^k)(\\partial_k f) - (Y^k \\partial_k X^j)(\\partial_j f)$$\nTo express this in the form $(L_X Y)^i \\partial_i f$, we must collect the coefficients of each $\\partial_i f$.

The form $\\omega$ is closed.\nThis immediately implies that the second term in Cartan's formula is zero:\n$$\ni_{X}(d\\omega) = i_{X}(0) = 0\n$$\n\nNow we evaluate the first term, $d(i_{X}\\omega)$. First, we compute the interior product $i_{X}\\omega$:\n$$\ni_{X}\\omega = i_{\\partial_{\\theta}}(r\\,dr\\wedge d\\theta)\n$$\nSince $r$ is a scalar function ($0$-form), it can be factored out:\n$$\ni_{X}\\omega = r \\, i_{\\partial_{\\theta}}(dr\\wedge d\\theta)\n$$\nThe interior product acts as an antiderivation on wedge products: $i_Y(\\alpha\\wedge\\beta) = (i_Y\\alpha)\\wedge\\beta + (-1)^{\\deg\\alpha}\\alpha\\wedge(i_Y\\beta)$. For the $1$-forms $dr$ and $d\\theta$, this gives:\n$$\ni_{\\partial_{\\theta}}(dr\\wedge d\\theta) = (i_{\\partial_{\\theta}}dr)\\wedge d\\theta - dr\\wedge(i_{\\partial_{\\theta}}d\\theta)\n$$\nWe evaluate the interior products:\n$$\ni_{\\partial_{\\theta}}dr = dr(\\partial_{\\theta}) = 0\n$$\n$$\ni_{\\partial_{\\theta}}d\\theta = d\\theta(\\partial_{\\theta}) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting these back:\n$$\ni_{\\partial_{\\theta}}(dr\\wedge d\\theta) = (0)\\wedge d\\theta - dr\\wedge(1) = -dr\n$$\nSo, the interior product is:\n$$\ni_{X}\\omega = r(-dr) = -r\\,dr\n$$\nNow we compute the exterior derivative of this result:\n$$\nd(i_{X}\\omega) = d(-r\\,dr) = -d(r\\,dr)\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz rule for $d(r\\,dr)$:\n$$\nd(r\\,dr) = dr \\wedge dr + r \\wedge d(dr)\n$$\nAs before, $dr\\wedge dr = 0$ and $d(dr)=0$. Thus, $d(r\\,dr) = 0$.\nThis means the first term in Cartan's formula is also zero:\n$$\nd(i_{X}\\omega) = 0\n$$\nCombining both terms, we find the Lie derivative of $\\omega$:\n$$\nL_{X}\\omega = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe final results are $L_{X}dr = 0$ and $L_{X}\\omega = 0$. We are asked to express the answer as a single row matrix $(L_{X}dr, L_{X}\\omega)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3055858"}]}
