We will validate that $S$ is a smooth submanifold, find its local charts, determine its tangent space, and finally compute the determinant of a Gram matrix at a specific point.\n\n1. First, we show that $S$ is a smooth embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ using the regular value criterion. Let's define a function $F : \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $F(x,y,z) = z - xy$. The function $F$ is a polynomial in its variables, so it is smooth (of class $C^{\\infty}$). The subset $S$ is precisely the level set of $F$ corresponding to the value $0$, i.e., $S = F^{-1}(0)$.\n\nAccording to the regular value criterion, $0$ is a regular value of $F$ if for every point $p \\in F^{-1}(0)$, the differential $DF_p$ is a surjective linear map. The differential of $F$ at a point $p=(x,y,z)$ is a linear map from $T_p\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ to $T_{F(p)}\\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, which can be represented by its Jacobian matrix.

This is equivalent to $DF_p$ being a non-zero matrix. Since the third component of the matrix is always $1$, the matrix $DF(x,y,z)$ is never the zero matrix for any point $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, $DF_p$ is surjective for all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, and in particular for all $p \\in F^{-1}(0)$. This means $0$ is a regular value of $F$. By the Regular Level Set Theorem, it follows that $S = F^{-1}(0)$ is a smooth embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ of dimension $3 - 1 = 2$.\n\n2. We use the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to find local charts. The IFT allows us to express one coordinate as a function of the others locally if the corresponding partial derivative of the defining function is non-zero.\nAs shown above, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 1 \\neq 0$ for all points. Thus, we can express $z$ as a smooth function of $x$ and $y$ everywhere on $S$. Solving $F(x,y,z) = 0$ for $z$ gives $z = xy$. This allows for a single global chart $\\phi_1: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to S$ defined by:\n$$ \\phi_1(u,v) = (u, v, uv) $$\nThe domain of this chart is all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nAlternatively, where $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = -x \\neq 0$ (i.e., for $x \\neq 0$), we can solve for $y$: $y=z/x$. This gives a local chart $\\phi_2: U_2 \\to S$ on the domain $U_2 = \\{(u,w) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 | u \\neq 0\\}$:\n$$ \\phi_2(u,w) = (u, \\frac{w}{u}, w) $$\nSimilarly, where $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -y \\neq 0$ (i.e., for $y \\neq 0$), we can solve for $x$: $x=z/y$. This gives a local chart $\\phi_3: U_3 \\to S$ on the domain $U_3 = \\{(v,w) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 | v \\neq 0\\}$:\n$$ \\phi_3(v,w) = (\\frac{w}{v}, v, w) $$\n\n3. Next, we derive the tangent space $T_pS$ at a general point $p = (a,b,ab) \\in S$. The tangent space at $p$ is the kernel of the differential $DF_p$. A tangent vector $v=(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is in $T_pS$ if $DF_p(v)=0$. At $p=(a,b,ab)$, the differential is $DF_p = \\begin{pmatrix} -b & -a & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The condition $DF_p(v) = 0$ becomes:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -b & -a & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ v_z \\end{pmatrix} = -bv_x - av_y + v_z = 0 $$\nThis equation defines the tangent space: $T_pS = \\{(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid v_z = bv_x + av_y\\}$.\nA vector in $T_pS$ can be written as $(v_x, v_y, bv_x + av_y)$. We can express this vector as a linear combination:\n$$ (v_x, v_y, bv_x + av_y) = v_x(1, 0, b) + v_y(0, 1, a) $$\nThis shows that the vectors $w_1 = (1, 0, b)$ and $w_2 = (0, 1, a)$ span $T_pS$. These two vectors are linearly independent (the first two components form the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^2$), so they form a basis for the $2$-dimensional tangent space $T_pS$. A convenient basis for $T_pS$ is thus $\\{ (1, 0, b), (0, 1, a) \\}$.\n\n4. Finally, we compute the determinant of the Gram matrix for the basis of $T_pS$ at the point $p = (1,2,2)$. First, we confirm $p \\in S$: for $(x,y,z)=(1,2,2)$, we have $z=2$ and $xy = (1)(2)=2$, so the condition is met.
