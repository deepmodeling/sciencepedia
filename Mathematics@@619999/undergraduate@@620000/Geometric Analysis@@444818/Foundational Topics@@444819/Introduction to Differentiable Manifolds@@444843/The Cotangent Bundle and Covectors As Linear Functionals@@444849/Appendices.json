We shall proceed by first establishing the theoretical framework for the tangent and cotangent spaces at a point, and then apply these definitions to the specific case provided.\n\nLet $M = \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a smooth manifold with its standard differentiable structure. We are interested in the tangent space and cotangent space at the point $p=0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the tangent space $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nA tangent vector at the point $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is defined as an equivalence class of smooth curves. A smooth curve through $0$ is a smooth map $c: I \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ where $I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is an open interval containing $0$, such that $c(0)=0$. Two such curves, $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, are said to be equivalent at $0$ if their derivatives at $t=0$ are equal, i.e., $c_{1}'(0) = c_{2}'(0)$. The derivative is computed component-wise using the standard coordinates of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nAn equivalence class of such curves, denoted $[c]$, is a tangent vector at $0$. The set of all such tangent vectors forms the tangent space $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nThis definition establishes a canonical isomorphism between $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ itself. The isomorphism $\\Phi: T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is given by $\\Phi([c]) = c'(0)$. The vector $c'(0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the velocity vector of the curve $c(t)$ at $t=0$. Under this identification, we can consider any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ as the tangent vector at $0$ corresponding to the equivalence class of the straight line curve $c(t) = tv$, since $c(0)=0$ and $c'(0)=v$.\n\nSecond, we identify the cotangent space $T_{0}^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the dual space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}$.\nThe cotangent space $T_{0}^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is, by definition, the dual space of the tangent space $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. That is, $T_{0}^{*}\\mathbbR^{n} = (T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}$. The elements of $T_{0}^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are called cotangent vectors, or covectors, and are linear functionals $\\omega: T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\nGiven the isomorphism $\\Phi: T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the cotangent space $T_{0}^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is naturally isomorphic to the dual space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}$. An element of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}$ is a linear map from $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nA primary source of covectors is the differential of a smooth function. Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. The differential of $f$ at the point $0$, denoted $df_{0}$, is defined as a linear map from the tangent space $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to the tangent space of the codomain, $T_{f(0)}\\mathbb{R}$. The tangent space $T_{y}\\mathbb{R}$ at any point $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is canonically identified with $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $df_{0}$ is a map $df_{0}: T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\nFor a tangent vector $v \\in T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ represented by a curve $c(t)$ (so $v = [c]$), the action of $df_{0}$ on $v$ is defined by the chain rule:\n$$ df_{0}(v) = (f \\circ c)'(0) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(c(t)) $$\nThis map is linear, which confirms that $df_{0}$ is indeed a covector, i.e., $df_{0} \\in T_{0}^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nIn the standard coordinates $(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n})$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, if a tangent vector $v \\in T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is identified with the vector $(v^{1}, \\dots, v^{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, its action under $df_0$ can be computed using the multivariable chain rule. For the curve $c(t) = (c_1(t), \\dots, c_n(t))$, we have $c'(0) = (v^1, \\dots, v^n)$. Then:\n$$ df_{0}(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(c(t)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{i}}\\bigg|_{x=0} \\frac{dc_{i}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{i}}\\bigg|_{x=0} v^{i} $$\nThis shows that the action of the covector $df_{0}$ on the vector $v$ is the dot product of the gradient vector of $f$ at $0$, $\\nabla f(0)$, with the vector $v$.\n\nNow we apply these principles to the given problem for $n=4$.\nThe smooth function is $f: \\mathbb{R}^{4} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, given by:\n$$ f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4})=\\exp(x_{1}+x_{2}^{2})+\\sin(x_{3}x_{4})+3x_{1}-2x_{4} $$\nThe tangent vector $v \\in T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is the velocity at $t=0$ of the curve $c(t)=t(1,2,-1,3)$.\nThe curve is $c(t) = (t, 2t, -t, 3t)$. Its velocity vector is $c'(t) = (1, 2, -1, 3)$.\nAt $t=0$, the velocity is $c'(0) = (1, 2, -1, 3)$.\nUnder the identification of $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$, the tangent vector is $v = (1,2,-1,3)$.\n\nWe want to compute $df_{0}(v)$. We can do this by computing the gradient of $f$ at the point $0 = (0,0,0,0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and then taking its dot product with $v$.\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives of $f$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}} \\left( \\exp(x_{1}+x_{2}^{2})+\\sin(x_{3}x_{4})+3x_{1}-2x_{4} \\right) = \\exp(x_{1}+x_{2}^{2}) + 3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}} \\left( \\exp(x_{1}+x_{2}^{2})+\\sin(x_{3}x_{4})+3x_{1}-2x_{4} \\right) = \\exp(x_{1}+x_{2}^{2}) \\cdot (2x_{2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{3}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{3}} \\left( \\exp(x_{1}+x_{2}^{2})+\\sin(x_{3}x_{4})+3x_{1}-2x_{4} \\right) = \\cos(x_{3}x_{4}) \\cdot x_{4} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{4}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{4}} \\left( \\exp(x_{1}+x_{2}^{2})+\\sin(x_{3}x_{4})+3x_{1}-2x_{4} \\right) = \\cos(x_{3}x_{4}) \\cdot x_{3} - 2 $$\n\nNext, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $0=(0,0,0,0)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{1}}\\bigg|_{0} = \\exp(0+0^{2}) + 3 = 1+3 = 4 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{2}}\\bigg|_{0} = \\exp(0+0^{2}) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 0) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{3}}\\bigg|_{0} = \\cos(0 \\cdot 0) \\cdot 0 = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{4}}\\bigg|_{0} = \\cos(0 \\cdot 0) \\cdot 0 - 2 = 1 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2 $$\nThe gradient vector of $f$ at $0$ is $\\nabla f(0) = (4, 0, 0, -2)$. This vector represents the covector $df_0$ in the standard basis.\n\nFinally, we compute the action of $df_{0}$ on $v=(1,2,-1,3)$:\n$$ df_{0}(v) = \\nabla f(0) \\cdot v = (4, 0, 0, -2) \\cdot (1, 2, -1, 3) $$\n$$ df_{0}(v) = (4)(1) + (0)(2) + (0)(-1) + (-2)(3) $$\n$$ df_{0}(v) = 4 + 0 - 0 - 6 = -2 $$\n\nAlternatively, using the definition $df_{0}(v) = (f \\circ c)'(0)$:\n$$ (f \\circ c)(t) = f(t, 2t, -t, 3t) = \\exp(t+(2t)^{2}) + \\sin((-t)(3t)) + 3(t) - 2(3t) $$\n$$ (f \\circ c)(t) = \\exp(t+4t^{2}) + \\sin(-3t^{2}) + 3t - 6t = \\exp(t+4t^{2}) - \\sin(3t^{2}) - 3t $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $t$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(f \\circ c)(t) = \\exp(t+4t^{2}) \\cdot (1+8t) - \\cos(3t^{2}) \\cdot (6t) - 3 $$\nEvaluating at $t=0$:\n$$ (f \\circ c)'(0) = \\exp(0) \\cdot (1) - \\cos(0) \\cdot (0) - 3 = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 0 - 3 = 1-3 = -2 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "3067931"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example at a single point, this practice generalizes the computation to an arbitrary point $p=(a,b)$ in the plane.
