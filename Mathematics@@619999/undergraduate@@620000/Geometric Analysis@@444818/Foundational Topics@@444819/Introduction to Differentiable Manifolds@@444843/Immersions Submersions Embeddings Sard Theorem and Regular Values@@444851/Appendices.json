A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem consists of three parts: constructing the differential of the map $f$, finding the preimage of a specific point $v$, and calculating the rank of the differential at the points in the preimage.\n\n**Part 1: Construct the differential $d f_{(x,y)}$**\n\nThe map is $f: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, given by $f(x,y) = (x^{2}, xy, y^{2})$.\nLet the component functions be $f_1(x,y) = x^2$, $f_2(x,y) = xy$, and $f_3(x,y) = y^2$.\nThe differential of $f$ at a point $p=(x,y)$, denoted $df_p$ or $df_{(x,y)}$, is the linear map whose matrix representation with respect to the standard bases of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the Jacobian matrix, $J_f(x,y)$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is a $3 \\times 2$ matrix of partial derivatives:\n$$\nJ_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2) = 2x$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2) = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy) = y$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(xy) = x$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2) = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2) = 2y$\n\nSubstituting these into the matrix, we get the Jacobian of $f$ at an arbitrary point $(x,y)$:\n$$\nJ_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2x  0 \\\\\ny  x \\\\\n0  2y\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix represents the linear map $d f_{(x,y)}: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Given a tangent vector $(v_1, v_2) \\in T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, its image under $df_{(x,y)}$ is:\n$$\ndf_{(x,y)}(v_1, v_2) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2x  0 \\\\\ny  x \\\\\n0  2y\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_1 \\\\\nv_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n2xv_1 \\\\\nyv_1 + xv_2 \\\\\n2yv_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Determine the preimage $f^{-1}(v)$**\n\nWe are given the target value $v = (1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$. We need to find all points $p=(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $f(p) = v$. This leads to the following system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 = 1 \\\\\nxy = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\ny^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $x^2 = 1$, we obtain $x = 1$ or $x = -1$.\nFrom the third equation, $y^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, we obtain $y = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $y = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe must check which pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the second equation, $xy = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n1. If $x=1$ and $y=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (1)(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is a solution. Let $p_1 = (1, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n2. If $x=1$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (1)(-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$. This is not a solution.\n3. If $x=-1$ and $y=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$. This is not a solution.\n4. If $x=-1$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (-1)(-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is a solution. Let $p_2 = (-1, -\\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nThus, the set of points in the preimage of $v$ is $f^{-1}(v) = \\{ (1, \\frac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\}$.\n\n**Part 3: Compute the rank of $d f_{p}$ at $p \\in f^{-1}(v)$**\n\nThe rank of the linear map $d f_{p}$ is equal to the rank of its matrix representation, the Jacobian matrix $J_f(p)$. We compute this rank for each point in $f^{-1}(v)$.\n\nFor $p_1 = (1, \\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$\nJ_f(1, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2(1)  0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  1 \\\\\n0  2(\\frac{1}{2})\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2  0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  1 \\\\\n0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent columns (or rows). The columns of this matrix are $C_1 = (2, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)^T$ and $C_2 = (0, 1, 1)^T$. These two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent. Since there are $2$ columns, the rank of this matrix is $2$.\nAlternatively, we can find a $2\\times 2$ submatrix with a non-zero determinant. For instance, the submatrix formed by the first two rows has determinant $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  1 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(1) - (0)(\\frac{1}{2}) = 2 \\neq 0$. Thus, the rank is at least $2$. As the matrix has only $2$ columns, its rank cannot exceed $2$. Therefore, the rank is exactly $2$.\n\nFor $p_2 = (-1, -\\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$\nJ_f(-1, -\\frac{1}{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2(-1)  0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2}  -1 \\\\\n0  2(-\\frac{1}{2})\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2  0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2}  -1 \\\\\n0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe columns are $C_1 = (-2, -\\frac{1}{2}, 0)^T$ and $C_2 = (0, -1, -1)^T$. These are also clearly linearly independent. The rank is $2$.\nUsing the minor method, the submatrix of the first two rows has determinant $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -2  0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2}  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-2)(-1) - (0)(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 2 \\neq 0$. The rank is therefore $2$.\n\nFor any point $p \\in f^{-1}(v)$, the rank of the differential $d f_{p}$ is $2$.\nThis implies that $f$ is an immersion at these points, since the rank of the differential ($2$) is equal to the dimension of the domain manifold ($\\mathbb{R}^2$).\nThe problem asks for the rank as a single integer.

We will address each task in sequence.\n\nFirst, we verify that $f$ is an immersion at every point of $S^{1}$.\nA smooth map $f: M \\to N$ is an immersion if its differential $d f_{p}$ is injective for every $p \\in M$. For our map $f:S^{1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the domain is a $1$-dimensional manifold. The tangent space $T_{\\theta}S^{1}$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space spanned by the vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$. The differential $d f_{\\theta}$ maps this basis vector to the tangent vector of the curve in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which is given by the derivative of $f$ with respect to $\\theta$.\nLet's compute this derivative:\n$$\nf'(\\theta) = \\frac{df}{d\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sin(2\\theta), \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)\\right) = (2\\cos(2\\theta), \\cos(\\theta)).\n$$\nThe differential $d f_{\\theta}$ is injective if and only if this tangent vector $f'(\\theta)$ is non-zero for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. We check if there exists any $\\theta$ for which $f'(\\theta)=(0,0)$. This would require both components to be zero simultaneously:\n$$\n2\\cos(2\\theta) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos(\\theta) = 0.\n$$\nFrom the second equation, $\\cos(\\theta) = 0$, the solutions in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ are $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nWe check if the first equation, $\\cos(2\\theta)=0$, holds for these values.\n- For $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $2\\theta = \\pi$. Then $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$. This is not $0$.\n- For $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, we have $2\\theta = 3\\pi$. Then $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos(3\\pi) = -1$. This is also not $0$.\nSince the two components of the tangent vector $f'(\\theta)$ are never simultaneously zero for any $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the vector $f'(\\theta)$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, the differential $d f_{\\theta}$ is injective for all $\\theta \\in S^{1}$, and $f$ is an immersion.\n\nSecond, we show that $f$ is not an embedding.\nAn embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. A necessary condition for a map to be a homeomorphism onto its image is that the map must be injective. We will show that $f$ is not injective on $S^{1}$. To do this, we need to find two distinct parameter values $\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2} \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, with $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$, such that $f(\\theta_{1}) = f(\\theta_{2})$.\nLet's test the values $\\theta_{1}=0$ and $\\theta_{2}=\\pi$. These are distinct in $[0, 2\\pi)$.\nFor $\\theta_{1}=0$:\n$$\nf(0) = (\\sin(2 \\cdot 0), \\sin(0)) = (\\sin(0), \\sin(0)) = (0,0).\n$$\nFor $\\theta_{2}=\\pi$:\n$$\nf(\\pi) = (\\sin(2\\pi), \\sin(\\pi)) = (0,0).\n$$\nSince $f(0) = f(\\pi)$ and $0 \\neq \\pi$, the map $f$ is not injective. A non-injective map cannot be a homeomorphism onto its image. Therefore, $f$ is not an embedding. The image of the curve self-intersects at the point $(0,0)$.\n\nThird, we solve explicitly for all pairs $(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2})$ corresponding to self-intersections.\nWe are looking for all pairs $(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}) \\in [0, 2\\pi)^2$ with $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$ such that $f(\\theta_{1}) = f(\\theta_{2})$. This equality gives rise to a system of two equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n    \\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = \\sin(2\\theta_{2})  (1) \\\\\n    \\sin(\\theta_{1}) = \\sin(\\theta_{2})  (2)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom equation $(2)$, for $\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2} \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$, it must be that $\\theta_{2} = \\pi - \\theta_{1}$ (or more generally $\\theta_{2} = n\\pi + (-1)^n \\theta_1$, but since we require distinct values in $[0,2\\pi)$, $\\theta_2 = \\pi - \\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2 = 2\\pi + \\theta_1$ etc are the main relations. The latter is excluded since $\\theta_2 \\geq 2\\pi$. The relation $\\theta_2 = \\pi - \\theta_1$ is the principal one to check). Let's substitute this into equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = \\sin(2(\\pi - \\theta_{1})) = \\sin(2\\pi - 2\\theta_{1}) = -\\sin(2\\theta_{1}).\n$$\nThis equation simplifies to $2\\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = 0$, which means $\\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = 0$.\nFor $\\theta_{1} \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, $2\\theta_{1}$ is in $[0, 4\\pi)$. The solutions for $2\\theta_{1}$ are $0, \\pi, 2\\pi, 3\\pi$.\nThis gives the possible values for $\\theta_{1}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{1} = 0, \\quad \\theta_{1} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\quad \\theta_{1} = \\pi, \\quad \\theta_{1} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}.\n$$\nNow we find the corresponding $\\theta_{2} = \\pi - \\theta_{1}$ for each case and check if $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$ and both are in $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n- If $\\theta_{1} = 0$, then $\\theta_{2} = \\pi - 0 = \\pi$.

In the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, this is equivalent to $\\theta_2 = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. Thus $\\theta_{1} = \\theta_{2}$, which is not a self-intersection.\nThe possible pairs $(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2})$ with $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$ are $(0, \\pi)$ and $(\\pi, 0)$. These correspond to a single self-intersection point, $f(0) = f(\\pi) = (0,0)$.\n\nFourth, we compute the value of $A$.\n$A$ is the sum of the distinct parameter values in $[0, 2\\pi)$ that map to the unique self-intersection point.\nFrom the previous step, the unique self-intersection point is $(0,0)$.

An open neighborhood $U$ of $(0,0)$ must contain points with $x0$, and its projection $\\pi_x(U)$ must be an open interval containing $0$, which includes negative values. Since no real function $g(x)$ can be defined for $x0$, no such function $g$ can exist on the domain $\\pi_x(U)$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. There exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $0$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ and a continuously differentiable ($C^1$) function $h:V\\to\\mathbb{R}$ with $h(0)=0$ such that $F(h(y),y)=0$ for all $y\\in V$.\n\nThis statement proposes solving for $x$ as a function of $y$, i.e., $x=h(y)$. The IFT now requires the partial derivative with respect to $x$ to be non-zero at $(0,0)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(0,0) = -3x^2 \\Big|_{(0,0)} = -3(0)^2 = 0 $$\nAgain, the condition of the IFT is not met.\nLet's analyze the equation directly: $F(h(y),y)=0$ means $y^2 - (h(y))^3 = 0$, or $(h(y))^3 = y^2$. This yields a unique real solution for $h(y)$, which is $h(y) = (y^2)^{1/3} = y^{2/3}$. This function is defined for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $h(0)=0$. We must check if it is $C^1$ on a neighborhood of $0$. The derivative for $y \\neq 0$ is:\n$$ h'(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(y^{2/3}) = \\frac{2}{3}y^{-1/3} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt[3]{y}} $$\nAs $y \\to 0$, the magnitude of the derivative $|h'(y)| \\to \\infty$. The function is not differentiable at $y=0$, and therefore cannot be $C^1$ in any neighborhood of $0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The set $F^{-1}(0)$ fails to be a $1$-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ at $(0,0)$; it admits a global parametrization $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ given by $\\gamma(t)=(t^2,t^3)$, which is injective but not an immersion at $t=0$.\n\nWe analyze this statement in parts.\n1.  **Failure to be a submanifold at $(0,0)$**: The definition provided states that if $c$ is a regular value, $F^{-1}(c)$ is an embedded submanifold. We found that $c=0$ is a critical value, not a regular one, because the preimage $F^{-1}(0)$ contains the critical point $(0,0)$. While the theorem's converse is not guaranteed in general, in this case, the set $F^{-1}(0)$ is the cuspidal cubic $y^2=x^3$. Any neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in this set is not locally homeomorphic to an open interval of $\\mathbb{R}$ (it has a cusp). Hence, $F^{-1}(0)$ is not a manifold at $(0,0)$. This part is true.\n2.  **Parametrization $\\gamma(t)=(t^2,t^3)$**: Let's check if points on this curve satisfy the equation $F(x,y)=0$. For $(x,y) = (t^2,t^3)$, we have $y^2 - x^3 = (t^3)^2 - (t^2)^3 = t^6 - t^6 = 0$. So the image of $\\gamma$ is on the curve. To see it covers the whole curve, take any $(x,y)$ such that $y^2=x^3$. This implies $x \\ge 0$. Let $t$ be such that $t^3=y$. Then $x=y^{2/3}=(t^3)^{2/3}=t^2$. So for any $(x,y)$ on the curve, there exists $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$ s.t. $(x,y)=(t^2, t^3)$. This is a global parametrization.\n3.  **Injectivity**: Suppose $\\gamma(t_1) = \\gamma(t_2)$. This means $(t_1^2, t_1^3) = (t_2^2, t_2^3)$. The second component equality $t_1^3 = t_2^3$ implies $t_1=t_2$ for real numbers. Thus, the map is injective.\n4.  **Not an immersion at $t=0$**: An immersion requires the derivative to have full rank, which for a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is rank-$1$. The derivative is $\\gamma'(t) = ( \\frac{d}{dt}(t^2), \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3) ) = (2t, 3t^2)$. At $t=0$, $\\gamma'(0)=(0,0)$. The zero vector has rank $0$. Therefore, $\\gamma$ is not an immersion at $t=0$.\nAll parts of the statement are accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. The value $0$ is a regular value of $F$.\n\nAs established earlier, the only critical point of $F$ is $(0,0)$, and its image is $F(0,0)=0$. Thus, $0$ is a critical value. By definition, a regular value is not a critical value. Therefore, $0$ is not a regular value.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. For every $c\\neq 0$ sufficiently small, the value $c$ is a regular value of $F$ and the level set $F^{-1}(c)$ is a $1$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe only critical value of $F$ is $0$. Therefore, any value $c \\neq 0$ is a regular value. This is true for all non-zero $c$, including those that are \"sufficiently small\".\nThe problem states: \"if $c$ is a regular value then $F^{-1}(c)$ is a $1$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$\". Since any $c \\neq 0$ is a regular value, it follows directly from this theorem that for any $c \\neq 0$, the level set $F^{-1}(c)$ is a $1$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The statement is therefore a direct consequence of the definitions and theorems provided.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nF. By Sard’s theorem, the set of critical values of $F$ has Lebesgue measure zero in $\\mathbb{R}$; in particular, almost every $c$ near $0$ is a regular value, while $c=0$ is an exceptional critical value illustrated by the cusp at the origin.\n\nSard's theorem states that for a smooth map between manifolds (like $F:\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$), the set of critical values has measure zero. In our case, the set of critical points is $\\{(0,0)\\}$, and the set of critical values is $\\{F(0,0)\\} = \\{0\\}$. A single point set in $\\mathbb{R}$ has Lebesgue measure zero. So, the first part of the statement, \"the set of critical values of $F$ has Lebesgue measure zero in $\\mathbb{R}$\", is a correct application of Sard's theorem.\nThe phrase \"almost every $c$ ... is a regular value\" means the set of non-regular (i.e., critical) values has measure zero. We've just confirmed this. The statement that $c=0$ is an \"exceptional critical value\" is also accurate, as it is the only one. The geometric feature corresponding to this critical value is indeed the cusp singularity in the level set $F^{-1}(0)$ at the origin. The entire statement correctly applies Sard's theorem and accurately describes the situation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CEF}$$", "id": "3052891"}]}
