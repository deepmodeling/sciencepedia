All terms are standard and clearly defined. The conditions provided are sufficient to derive a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the Stabilizer Subgroup\n\nLet $p_\\theta = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ be a point on the unit circle $S^1$. The group acting on $S^1$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{e, \\sigma\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element and $\\sigma$ is the reflection across the $x$-axis, $\\sigma(x,y) = (x,-y)$.\n\nThe stabilizer subgroup of $p_\\theta$, denoted $\\operatorname{Stab}(p_\\theta)$, is the set of all elements $g \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ such that $g \\cdot p_\\theta = p_\\theta$.\n\nThe identity element $e$ fixes every point by definition, so $e \\cdot p_\\theta = p_\\theta$ for all $\\theta$. Thus, $e \\in \\operatorname{Stab}(p_\\theta)$ for all $p_\\theta \\in S^1$.\n\nNext, we check when the element $\\sigma$ fixes the point $p_\\theta$. The action of $\\sigma$ on $p_\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma(p_\\theta) = \\sigma(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, -\\sin\\theta)\n$$\nFor $\\sigma$ to be in the stabilizer, we must have $\\sigma(p_\\theta) = p_\\theta$, which means:\n$$\n(\\cos\\theta, -\\sin\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)\n$$\nThis vector equality holds if and only if their components are equal. The first components are already equal. The second components must satisfy:\n$$\n-\\sin\\theta = \\sin\\theta \\implies 2\\sin\\theta = 0 \\implies \\sin\\theta = 0\n$$\nFor a point on the unit circle $S^1$, $\\sin\\theta = 0$ when $\\theta = k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. The distinct points on the circle are for $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\pi$.\n- For $\\theta = 0$, $p_0 = (\\cos(0), \\sin(0)) = (1, 0)$.\n- For $\\theta = \\pi$, $p_\\pi = (\\cos(\\pi), \\sin(\\pi)) = (-1, 0)$.\n\nSo, there are two cases for the stabilizer subgroup:\n1. If $p_\\theta$ is one of the two points $(1,0)$ or $(-1,0)$ (i.e., $\\sin\\theta = 0$), then both $e$ and $\\sigma$ fix $p_\\theta$. The stabilizer subgroup is the entire group: $\\operatorname{Stab}(p_\\theta) = \\{e, \\sigma\\} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n2. If $p_\\theta$ is any other point on $S^1$ (i.e., $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$), then $\\sigma(p_\\theta) \\neq p_\\theta$. The only element that fixes $p_\\theta$ is the identity $e$. The stabilizer subgroup is the trivial group: $\\operatorname{Stab}(p_\\theta) = \\{e\\}$.\n\nPart 2: Orbit Types and Strata\n\nThe orbit type of a point is determined by the conjugacy class of its stabilizer subgroup. The group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is abelian, so every subgroup is its own conjugacy class. From Part 1, we found two distinct stabilizer subgroups, $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. These correspond to two distinct orbit types.\n\nA stratum is the set of all points in the manifold having the same orbit type (i.e., stabilizers belonging to the same conjugacy class).\n\n- **Orbit Type 1: Stabilizer $\\mathbb{Z}_2$**\n  The corresponding stratum consists of all points $p \\in S^1$ such that $\\operatorname{Stab}(p) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. These are the fixed points of the action. As determined in Part 1, this stratum is the discrete set of two points:\n  $$\n  S^1_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} = \\{(1,0), (-1,0)\\}\n  $$\n\n- **Orbit Type 2: Stabilizer $\\{e\\}$**\n  The corresponding stratum consists of all points $p \\in S^1$ such that $\\operatorname{Stab}(p) = \\{e\\}$. The action is free at these points. This stratum is the set of all points on $S^1$ that are not fixed points:\n  $$\n  S^1_{\\{e\\}} = S^1 \\setminus \\{(1,0), (-1,0)\\}\n  $$\n  This is the principal stratum, an open and dense subset of $S^1$.\n\nPart 3: Total Length of the Quotient Space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe quotient space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the set of all orbits of the action. The action $\\sigma(x,y) = (x,-y)$ identifies each point $(x,y)$ with $(x,-y)$.\n- For a point $(x,y)$ with $y \\neq 0$, its orbit is the two-point set $\\{(x,y), (x,-y)\\}$.\n- For a point $(x,0)$, its orbit is the singleton set $\\{(x,0)\\}$. These are the fixed points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.\n\nGeometrically, the quotient space is formed by \"folding\" the circle $S^1$ along its horizontal diameter. The upper semi-circle, defined by $\\{(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta) \\mid \\theta \\in [0, \\pi]\\}$, provides a unique representative for every orbit. Thus, the quotient space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is homeomorphic to this closed semi-circle, which in turn is homeomorphic to a closed interval. The endpoints of this interval correspond to the orbits of the fixed points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the length of a rectifiable curve in the quotient space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is defined as the length of its lift in $S^1$. The total length of the space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the distance between its two boundary points, which are the images of the fixed points under the quotient map $q$, namely $q((1,0))$ and $q((-1,0))$.\n\nThis distance is the infimum of the lengths of all paths in $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ connecting these two points. By the given definition, this is equivalent to the infimum of the lengths of all paths in $S^1$ that connect the preimages of these points. Since the fixed points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$ are the sole points in their respective orbits, we need to find the shortest path in $S^1$ between $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.\n\nOn the unit circle, the shortest path between two points is the shorter of the two circular arcs connecting them. The points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$ are diametrically opposite. The paths connecting them are the upper and lower semi-circles, both of which have the same length.\n\nThe total circumference of the unit circle (with radius $R=1$) is $2\\pi R = 2\\pi$. The length of a semi-circle is half of the total circumference.\n$$\n\\text{Length} = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi) = \\pi\n$$\nAlternatively, we can compute this length via integration. Let's parametrize the upper semi-circle by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$. The starting point is $\\gamma(0) = (1,0)$ and the endpoint is $\\gamma(\\pi) = (-1,0)$. The arc length is given by the integral of the magnitude of the velocity vector:\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| dt\n$$\nThe velocity vector is $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t)$. Its magnitude (the speed) is:\n$$\n\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(-\\sin t)^2 + (\\cos t)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t} = 1\n$$\nThe length is therefore:\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 1 dt = [t]_{0}^{\\pi} = \\pi - 0 = \\pi\n$$\nThis path in $S^1$ is a lift of a path that traverses the entire quotient space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$. By the definition of the quotient metric, the length of the quotient space is equal to the length of this shortest lift.\n\nTherefore, the total length of $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi}\n$$", "id": "3051138"}, {"introduction": "Building upon our understanding of orbits, we now investigate a free action by a continuous group.

The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem statement is clear, and the sequence of tasks leads to a uniquely determined result for the Euler characteristic. The structure is logical and self-contained.\n- **Objective:** The problem is formulated with precise mathematical language, free from any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution is warranted.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we identify the orbits of the action. An orbit of a point $x \\in M$ under the action of the group $G = \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is the set of all points in $M$ that can be reached from $x$ by the action of some element of $G$. The orbit of $x$, denoted $\\mathcal{O}_x$, is formally defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}_x = \\{t \\cdot x \\mid t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}\\}\n$$\nFor any given $x = (x_1, x_2) \\in M = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the set is $\\{t(x_1, x_2) \\mid t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}\\}$. Geometrically, this describes a ray in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that starts at the origin (but does not include it, since $t>0$ and $x \\neq 0$) and passes through the point $x$. Therefore, the orbits of this action are the open rays emanating from the origin. The orbit space $M / \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is the set of all such rays.\n\nSecond, we construct a homeomorphism between $M / \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and the unit circle $S^1 = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\|y\\| = 1\\}$.\nLet's define a map $r : M \\to S^1$ using the Euclidean norm $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$. For any $x \\in M$, we have $x \\neq 0$, so $\\|x\\| > 0$. We define the map as:\n$$\nr(x) = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\n$$\nThis map is well-defined because the denominator is never zero. The codomain is $S^1$ because $\\|r(x)\\| = \\left\\|\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\\right\\| = \\frac{1}{\\|x\\|}\\|x\\| = 1$. The map $r$ represents the radial projection of a point onto the unit circle. The function $x \\mapsto \\|x\\|$ is continuous on $M$, and vector division by a non-zero scalar is a continuous operation. Thus, $r$ is a continuous map.\n\nNext, we show that $r$ is constant on the orbits of the action. Let $y$ be a point in the orbit of $x$. This means $y = tx$ for some $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. Applying the map $r$ to $y$:\n$$\nr(y) = r(tx) = \\frac{tx}{\\|tx\\|} = \\frac{tx}{|t|\\|x\\|}\n$$\nSince $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, we have $|t|=t$. So,\n$$\nr(y) = \\frac{tx}{t\\|x\\|} = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|} = r(x)\n$$\nThis confirms that $r$ is constant on each orbit. By the universal property of the quotient topology, because $r$ is continuous and constant on the fibers of the projection map $\\pi : M \\to M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ (which are the orbits), there exists a unique continuous map $\\overline{r} : M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0} \\to S^1$ such that $r = \\overline{r} \\circ \\pi$. This map is defined by taking an orbit $[x] \\in M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and mapping it to $r(x)$.\n$$\n\\overline{r}([x]) = r(x) = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\n$$\nWe now show that $\\overline{r}$ is a bijection.\n- **Injectivity**: Suppose $\\overline{r}([x]) = \\overline{r}([y])$ for some orbits $[x], [y] \\in M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. By definition, this means $r(x) = r(y)$, so $\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|} = \\frac{y}{\\|y\\|}$. This implies $y = \\frac{\\|y\\|}{\\|x\\|}x$. Let $t = \\frac{\\|y\\|}{\\|x\\|}$. Since $x, y \\in M$, their norms are positive, and thus $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. As $y = tx$, $y$ belongs to the orbit of $x$, which means $[x] = [y]$. Therefore, $\\overline{r}$ is injective.\n- **Surjectivity**: Let $z$ be an arbitrary point in $S^1$. Since $\\|z\\|=1$, $z$ is not the origin, so $z \\in M$. Consider the orbit $[z] \\in M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. We have $\\overline{r}([z]) = r(z) = \\frac{z}{\\|z\\|} = \\frac{z}{1} = z$. Thus, for any $z \\in S^1$, there exists an orbit in $M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ that maps to it. Therefore, $\\overline{r}$ is surjective.\n\nSince $\\overline{r}$ is a continuous bijection, to prove it is a homeomorphism, we must show that its inverse is also continuous. Let's define the inverse map $\\overline{r}^{-1} : S^1 \\to M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. For any $z \\in S^1$, we can define its image to be the orbit of $z$ itself:\n$$\n\\overline{r}^{-1}(z) = [z]\n$$\nThis map is the composition of the inclusion map $i : S^1 \\hookrightarrow M$, defined by $i(z) = z$, and the canonical projection $\\pi : M \\to M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, defined by $\\pi(x) = [x]$. So, $\\overline{r}^{-1} = \\pi \\circ i$. The inclusion map $i$ is continuous. The projection map $\\pi$ is continuous by the definition of the quotient topology. The composition of two continuous maps is continuous. Therefore, $\\overline{r}^{-1}$ is continuous. A continuous bijection with a continuous inverse is a homeomorphism. We have thus shown that $M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$.\n\nThird, we determine the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M / \\mathbb{R}_{>0})$. Since Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, homeomorphic spaces have the same Euler characteristic. Thus, $\\chi(M/\\mathbb{R}_{>0}) = \\chi(S^1)$. We compute $\\chi(S^1)$ from a cellular decomposition (a CW-complex structure).\nA minimal cellular decomposition of the circle $S^1$ consists of:\n- One $0$-cell (a single vertex), let's denote the number of $0$-cells by $c_0=1$.\n- One $1$-cell (an open edge), whose two endpoints are identified and attached to the single $0$-cell. Let's denote the number of $1$-cells by $c_1=1$.\nThere are no cells of higher dimension, so $c_k = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\nThe Euler characteristic is defined as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension:\n$$\n\\chi(S^1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k c_k = (-1)^0 c_0 + (-1)^1 c_1 + (-1)^2 c_2 + \\dots\n$$\nSubstituting the values from our decomposition:\n$$\n\\chi(S^1) = (1)(1) + (-1)(1) + 0 + \\dots = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the orbit space is $\\chi(M / \\mathbb{R}_{>0}) = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3051132"}, {"introduction": "This final practice advances from the topological and set-theoretic picture to the differential structure of a group action.

The component functions $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$ are compositions of basic smooth ($C^\\infty$) functions: the trigonometric functions $\\sin\\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta$, and linear functions of $p_1$ and $p_2$. Since sums, differences, and products of smooth functions are smooth, both $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$ are smooth functions from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (representing the local coordinates) to $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the map $\\Phi$ is smooth.\n\nSecond, we determine the differential of $\\Phi$ at the point $(I,\\mathbf{p})$, denoted $d\\Phi_{(I,\\mathbf{p})}$.\n\nThe differential (or pushforward) of a smooth map $F: M \\to N$ at a point $q \\in M$ is a linear map $dF_q : T_q M \\to T_{F(q)} N$. It is defined by its action on a tangent vector $v \\in T_q M$.

Substituting these in gives:\n$$\n\\sigma'(t) = X\\exp(tX)(\\mathbf{p} + t\\mathbf{w}) + \\exp(tX)\\mathbf{w}\n$$\nNow we evaluate this expression at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\sigma'(0) = X\\exp(0 \\cdot X)(\\mathbf{p} + 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) + \\exp(0 \\cdot X)\\mathbf{w}\n$$\nSince $\\exp(0) = I$ (the identity matrix), we get:\n$$\n\\sigma'(0) = X I \\mathbf{p} + I \\mathbf{w} = X\\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{w}\n$$\nThus, the differential of the action map $\\Phi$ at $(I, \\mathbf{p})$ applied to a tangent vector $(X, \\mathbf{w})$ is given by the expression $X\\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{w}$. This is a linear map from $\\mathfrak{so}(2) \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n$$\nd\\Phi_{(I,\\mathbf{p})}(X, \\mathbf{w}) = X\\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{w}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the differential.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{X\\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{w}}\n$$", "id": "3051117"}]}
