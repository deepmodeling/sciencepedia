An embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. For $F$ to be a homeomorphism onto its image, it must be injective. Let's check for self-intersections.

Therefore, there are no points in $S$ for which $x=0$ and $y=0$. This means that there are no critical points of $F$ in the level set $S$.\nConsequently, for every point $p \\in S$, the Jacobian matrix $J_{F}(p)$ has rank $2$.
