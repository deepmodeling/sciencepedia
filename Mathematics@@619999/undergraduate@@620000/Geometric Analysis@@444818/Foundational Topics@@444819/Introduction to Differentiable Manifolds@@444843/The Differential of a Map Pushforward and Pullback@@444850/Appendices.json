The solution will be derived from first principles using two distinct methods as specified, and the equivalence of the results will be established.\n\nFirst, we address the problem using the constraint method. The sphere $S^2$ is defined as the level set $F^{-1}(0)$ of the smooth function $F:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ given by $F(x)=x\\cdot x-1$. For any point $p \\in S^2$, by definition, we have $\\|p\\|^2=1$, so $F(p)=\\|p\\|^2-1=1-1=0$. The tangent space $T_p S^2$ can be characterized as the kernel of the differential of $F$ at $p$, denoted $dF_{p}:T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to T_{F(p)}\\mathbb{R}$. We identify the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The definition of the differential states that it is the unique linear map such that for any vector $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the following holds:\n$$F(p+h) = F(p) + dF_{p}(h) + o(\\|h\\|) \\quad \\text{as } \\|h\\| \\to 0$$\nWe compute the value of $F$ at the point $p+h$:\n$$F(p+h) = (p+h)\\cdot(p+h) - 1 = p\\cdot p + 2(p\\cdot h) + h\\cdot h - 1$$\nSince $F(p) = p\\cdot p - 1$, we have:\n$$F(p+h) = F(p) + 2(p\\cdot h) + \\|h\\|^2$$\nBy comparing this expansion with the definition of the differential, we can identify the linear term in $h$. The term $dF_p(h)$ is the part of the increment that is linear in $h$, which is $2(p\\cdot h)$. Thus, the differential is the linear map given by:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = 2(p\\cdot v)$$\nfor any $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$. The remainder term is $\\|h\\|^2$, which is of order $o(\\|h\\|)$ since $\\lim_{\\|h\\|\\to 0} \\|h\\|^2/\\|h\\| = 0$.\nThe gradient of $F$ at $p$ is $\\nabla F(p) = 2p$. Since $p\\in S^2$, $p$ is not the zero vector, so $\\nabla F(p) \\neq 0$. This ensures that $0$ is a regular value of $F$, and thus $S^2=F^{-1}(0)$ is a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The tangent space $T_{p}S^{2}$ is the kernel of the linear map $dF_p$. A vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is in $T_p S^2$ if and only if $dF_p(v) = 0$.\n$$dF_{p}(v)=0 \\iff 2(p\\cdot v) = 0 \\iff p\\cdot v = 0$$\nTherefore, the constraint method yields the following characterization of the tangent space:\n$$T_{p}S^2 = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$$\nThis is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that are orthogonal to the position vector $p$.\n\nSecond, we use the curve method. A vector $v$ is in $T_p S^2$ if and only if there exists a smooth curve $\\gamma:(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)\\to S^2$ for some $\\epsilon>0$ such that $\\gamma(0)=p$ and the velocity vector at $t=0$ is $\\gamma'(0)=v$.\nSince the curve $\\gamma$ lies on the sphere $S^2$, the equation $\\|\\gamma(t)\\|^2=1$ holds for all $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. This can be written as $\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t) = 1$. Differentiating this identity with respect to $t$ using the product rule for the dot product, we get:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t)) = \\gamma'(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t) + \\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma'(t) = 2(\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma'(t))$$\nSince $\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t)$ is constant ($1$), its derivative must be $0$.\n$$2(\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma'(t)) = 0$$\nThis must be true for all $t$. In particular, at $t=0$:\n$$2(\\gamma(0)\\cdot\\gamma'(0)) = 0$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=v$, we find the necessary condition:\n$$2(p\\cdot v) = 0 \\implies p\\cdot v = 0$$\nThis shows that any tangent vector defined via a curve must be orthogonal to $p$. So, $T_{p}S^{2} \\subseteq \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$.\n\nTo show the converse (i.e., that any vector $v$ satisfying $p\\cdot v=0$ is a tangent vector), we must construct a suitable curve. Let $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ be a vector such that $p \\cdot v = 0$.\nIf $v$ is the zero vector, $v=0$, we can choose the constant curve $\\gamma(t)=p$ for all $t$. Then $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=0=v$, and the curve lies on $S^2$.\nIf $v \\neq 0$, we can construct a curve that corresponds to a great circle on $S^2$ passing through $p$ with initial direction $v$. Consider the curve:\n$$\\gamma(t) = p\\cos(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(\\|v\\|t)$$\nThis curve is smooth for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We check the required properties.\n1. The curve lies on $S^2$:\n$\\|\\gamma(t)\\|^2 = \\left(p\\cos(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(\\|v\\|t)\\right) \\cdot \\left(p\\cos(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(\\|v\\|t)\\right)$\n$= \\|p\\|^2\\cos^2(\\|v\\|t) + \\left\\|\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right\\|^2\\sin^2(\\|v\\|t) + 2\\left(p\\cdot\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right)\\cos(\\|v\\|t)\\sin(\\|v\\|t)$\nSince $p\\in S^2$, $\\|p\\|=1$. By definition, $\\|v/\\|v\\|\\|=1$. From our assumption $p\\cdot v=0$, it follows that $p\\cdot(v/\\|v\\|)=0$. Substituting these values, we get:\n$\\|\\gamma(t)\\|^2 = (1)\\cos^2(\\|v\\|t) + (1)\\sin^2(\\|v\\|t) + 0 = 1$. The curve lies on $S^2$.\n2. The initial position is correct: $\\gamma(0) = p\\cos(0) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(0) = p(1) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}(0) = p$.\n3. The initial velocity is correct. First, we compute the derivative:\n$\\gamma'(t) = -p\\|v\\|\\sin(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\|v\\|\\cos(\\|v\\|t) = -p\\|v\\|\\sin(\\|v\\|t) + v\\cos(\\|v\\|t)$.\nEvaluating at $t=0$: $\\gamma'(0) = -p\\|v\\|\\sin(0) + v\\cos(0) = 0 + v(1) = v$.\nSince we have constructed a valid curve for any $v$ satisfying $p\\cdot v=0$, we have shown that $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\} \\subseteq T_{p}S^{2}$.\nCombined with the previous inclusion, this proves that the curve method also yields $T_{p}S^{2}=\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$.\n\nFinally, for the third part, we verify that the characterizations agree and relate them to the pushforward of the inclusion map $\\iota:S^2 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3$. Both methods have produced the identical set $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$. The tangent space $T_p S^2$ is thus identified with a specific $2$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nThe pushforward map $\\iota_*: T_p S^2 \\to T_{\\iota(p)}\\mathbb{R}^3 = T_p \\mathbb{R}^3$ is defined by its action on a tangent vector $v=\\gamma'(0) \\in T_p S^2$. By definition, $\\iota_*(v) = (\\iota \\circ \\gamma)'(0)$.\nSince $\\iota$ is the inclusion map, $\\iota(x)=x$. Thus, $(\\iota \\circ \\gamma)(t) = \\gamma(t)$. The pushforward of the velocity vector $\\gamma'(0)$ is:\n$$\\iota_*(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\iota\\circ\\gamma)(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\gamma(t) = \\gamma'(0) = v$$\nThe pushforward map $\\iota_*$ simply identifies the abstract tangent vector $v \\in T_pS^2$ with the same vector $v$ viewed as an element of the ambient space $T_p \\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$. The image of the pushforward, $\\text{Im}(\\iota_*)$, is therefore the set of all such vectors $v$, which our analysis has shown to be precisely the set $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$. This confirms that both foundational characterizations of $T_pS^2$ properly describe the tangent space as a specific subspace of the ambient Euclidean space, which corresponds to the image of the pushforward of the inclusion map.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}}$$", "id": "3068285"}, {"introduction": "The differential, or pushforward, is the linearization of a map, providing the best linear approximation of its behavior near a point.

This condition is satisfied if $x=0$ or $y=0$. The critical set is the union of the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis:\n$$\nC = \\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x=0 \\text{ or } y=0 \\}\n$$\nWe can further analyze the rank on this critical set:\n- If $x=0$ and $y \\neq 0$, $J_F(0,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2y \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank $1$.\n- If $x \\neq 0$ and $y=0$, $J_F(x,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank $1$.\n- If $x=0$ and $y=0$, $J_F(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank $0$.\n\n**Task 2: Describe the local structure of the image near the origin.**\nWe are asked to analyze the neighborhood of the origin $p=(0,0)$. First, we note that the rank of $F_{*}|_{(0,0)}$ is $0$.\n\nThe problem mentions the constant rank theorem. This theorem states that if a smooth map has constant rank $k$ in a neighborhood of a point, then it can be represented in local coordinates as a projection $(x_1, \\dots, x_m) \\mapsto (x_1, \\dots, x_k, 0, \\dots, 0)$. Let us check the hypothesis of this theorem. In any neighborhood of the origin $(0,0)$, there are points where the rank of $F_{*}|_{p}$ is not constant. Specifically:\n- At $p=(0,0)$, the rank is $0$.\n- At any point $p=(x,y)$ with $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$ (however close to the origin), the rank is $2$.\n- At any point $p=(x,0)$ with $x\\neq 0$ or $p=(0,y)$ with $y \\neq 0$, the rank is $1$.\n\nSince the rank is not constant in any open neighborhood of the origin, the constant rank theorem does not apply. The fact that its hypothesis is not met explains why the local behavior of $F$ near the origin is not as simple as a projection and requires direct analysis. The point $p=(0,0)$ is a degenerate critical point.\n\nLet's analyze the image of a small neighborhood of the origin directly. Let $U = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ be a square neighborhood of $(0,0)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. The image of $U$ under $F$ is:\n$$\nF(U) = \\{ (x^2, y^2) \\mid x \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon), y \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\} = [0, \\epsilon^2) \\times [0, \\epsilon^2)\n$$\nThe image is a square in the first quadrant of the target $\\mathbb{R}^2$, including the segments $[0, \\epsilon^2)$ on the coordinate axes that meet at the origin $F(0,0) = (0,0)$.\n\nIs $F(U)$ a submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ near $F(0,0)$? A $k$-dimensional submanifold must be locally homeomorphic to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^k$. The set $F(U)$ near the origin $(0,0)$ is a manifold with a corner. No neighborhood of $(0,0)$ within $F(U)$ is homeomorphic to an open disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (it's not open in $\\mathbb{R}^2$), nor to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}^1$, nor to a point (a $0$-manifold). Therefore, $F(U)$ is not a submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ at the point $F(0,0)$. This is a typical consequence of a point being a critical value of a map.\n\nNow, we consider the number of preimages for points near $F(0,0)=(0,0)$. Let $(u,v)$ be a point in the image $F(U)$.\n- A \"typical\" point is one in the interior of the image, i.e., $(u,v)$ such that $u \\in (0, \\epsilon^2)$ and $v \\in (0, \\epsilon^2)$. To find the preimages, we solve $(x^2, y^2) = (u,v)$. This gives $x = \\pm\\sqrt{u}$ and $y = \\pm\\sqrt{v}$. Since $u,v < \\epsilon^2$, we have $|\\pm\\sqrt{u}| < \\epsilon$ and $|\\pm\\sqrt{v}| < \\epsilon$, so all four preimages are in $U$. The four preimages are $(\\sqrt{u}, \\sqrt{v})$, $(\\sqrt{u}, -\\sqrt{v})$, $(-\\sqrt{u}, \\sqrt{v})$, and $(-\\sqrt{u}, -\\sqrt{v})$. Thus, typical points in the image near the origin have $4$ preimages.\n- Points on the boundary of the image (but not the corner) have fewer preimages. For a point $(u,0)$ with $u>0$, the preimages are $(\\pm\\sqrt{u}, 0)$, so there are $2$ preimages. Symmetrically, a point $(0,v)$ with $v>0$ has $2$ preimages $(0, \\pm\\sqrt{v})$.\n- The corner point $(0,0)$ has exactly one preimage, which is the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for a specific numerical value.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nWe must provide the rank of the pushforward $F_{*}|_{(0,0)}$. As computed above, the Jacobian matrix at the origin is:\n$$\nJ_F(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(0) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of the zero matrix is $0$.\nThus, the rank of $F_{*}|_{(0,0)}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3068286"}, {"introduction": "The pullback is the dual operation to the pushforward, allowing us to transport geometric structures like differential forms backward from a target manifold to the source manifold.

This means the map $\\Phi$ is orientation-preserving at every point where its differential is invertible.\n\nThe exceptional points are where $\\det(J\\Phi) = 0$.\n$$4(u^{2}+v^{2}) = 0 \\iff u^{2}+v^{2}=0$$\nThis equation holds if and only if $u=0$ and $v=0$. Thus, the only exceptional point is the origin $(0,0)$. At this point, the Jacobian matrix is the zero matrix, the map is singular, and it is not a local diffeomorphism.\n\nThe final answer requires a pair consisting of the pullback form and the analytic expression whose sign dictates orientation. These are $\\Phi^{*}(dx\\wedge dy) = 4(u^{2}+v^{2})du\\wedge dv$ and $\\det(J\\Phi) = 4(u^{2}+v^{2})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4(u^{2}+v^{2})du \\wedge dv & 4(u^{2}+v^{2})\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3048411"}]}
