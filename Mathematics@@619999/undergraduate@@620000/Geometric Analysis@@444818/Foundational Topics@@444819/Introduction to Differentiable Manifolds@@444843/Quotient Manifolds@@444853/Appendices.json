We will address the four specified tasks sequentially to characterize the surface $M$ and compute its Euler characteristic, $\\chi(M)$.\n\n### 1. Justification as a Compact, Connected, Hausdorff 2-Manifold without Boundary\n\n**Compactness and Connectedness:**\nThe space $Q=[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. By the Heine-Borel theorem, $Q$ is compact. The space $M=Q/\\sim$ is the image of $Q$ under the continuous quotient map $\\pi:Q\\to M$. Since the continuous image of a compact space is compact, $M$ is a compact topological space.\nSimilarly, $Q$ is path-connected and therefore connected. The continuous image of a connected space is connected, so $M$ is a connected topological space.\n\n**Manifold Structure:**\nTo demonstrate that $M$ is a $2$-dimensional topological manifold without boundary, we must show that every point $p \\in M$ possesses an open neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $p = \\pi(q)$ for some $q \\in Q$. We consider three cases for the location of $q$:\n\n-   **Case 1: Interior points.** If $q$ lies in the interior of the square, $(0,1)\\times(0,1)$, then the equivalence class of $q$ is the singleton set $\\{q\\}$. The quotient map $\\pi$ is a homeomorphism on a sufficiently small open disk around $q$ contained entirely within the interior of $Q$. Thus, $p$ has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open disk.\n\n-   **Case 2: Edge points (not corners).** If $q$ lies on an edge but is not a vertex, its equivalence class consists of two points.\n    -   If $q_1 = (x_0, 0)$ for some $x_0 \\in (0,1)$, its equivalence class is $\\{q_1, q_2\\}$ where $q_2 = (x_0, 1)$. A neighborhood of $p=\\pi(q_1)$ in $M$ is formed by the image of two semi-disks in $Q$ centered at $q_1$ and $q_2$ respectively. When glued along their diameters by the identification, they form a neighborhood homeomorphic to a full open disk.\n    -   If $q_1 = (0, y_0)$ for some $y_0 \\in (0,1)$, its equivalence class is $\\{q_1, q_2\\}$ where $q_2 = (1, 1-y_0)$. A similar argument shows that gluing the neighborhoods of $q_1$ and $q_2$ results in a neighborhood of $p=\\pi(q_1)$ homeomorphic to an open disk.\n\n-   **Case 3: Corner points.** The four corners of the square are $v_1=(0,0)$, $v_2=(1,0)$, $v_3=(1,1)$, and $v_4=(0,1)$. We trace their identifications:\n    -   From $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$: setting $x=0$ gives $(0,0)\\sim(0,1)$ ($v_1 \\sim v_4$), and setting $x=1$ gives $(1,0)\\sim(1,1)$ ($v_2 \\sim v_3$).\n    -   From $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$: setting $y=0$ gives $(0,0)\\sim(1,1)$ ($v_1 \\sim v_3$), and setting $y=1$ gives $(0,1)\\sim(1,0)$ ($v_4 \\sim v_2$).\n    -   By transitivity, all four vertices are identified to a single point in $M$: $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3$. A neighborhood of this single vertex point in $M$ is formed by gluing the four quarter-disks at each corner of $Q$. These four quarter-disks smoothly join to form a single neighborhood homeomorphic to an open disk.\n\nSince every point in $M$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open disk, $M$ is a $2$-dimensional topological manifold without boundary.\n\n**Hausdorff Property:**\nA topological manifold is, by definition, locally Euclidean and thus locally Hausdorff. A standard theorem in topology states that a compact, locally Hausdorff space is Hausdorff. Since we have already established that $M$ is compact and a manifold (hence locally Hausdorff), it follows that $M$ is a Hausdorff space.\n\n### 2. Orientability\n\nA surface is nonorientable if it contains a Möbius strip as a subspace. Let's analyze the effect of the identifications. The identification $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$ glues the top and bottom edges of the square to form a cylinder. The second identification, $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$, glues the two boundary circles of this cylinder. This second gluing involves a reversal of orientation.\n\nConsider a horizontal strip $S = [0,1] \\times [y_1, y_2]$ with $0 < y_1 < y_2 < 1$. The quotient space $\\pi(S)$ is formed by identifying the left edge $\\{0\\}\\times[y_1, y_2]$ with the right edge $\\{1\\}\\times[y_1, y_2]$ via the map $(0,y) \\mapsto (1,1-y)$. If we trace a path upward along the left edge from $(0,y_1)$ to $(0,y_2)$, the corresponding path on the right edge travels downward from $(1, 1-y_1)$ to $(1, 1-y_2)$. This orientation-reversing gluing of the ends of a rectangular strip is the definition of a Möbius strip. Since $M$ contains a Möbius strip, it is a nonorientable surface.\n\n### 3. Euler Characteristic\n\nThe Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ can be computed using a cell decomposition of $M$ induced by the square $Q$ and its identifications, using the formula $\\chi(M) = V - E + F$, where $V$, $E$, and $F$ are the number of vertices ($0$-cells), edges ($1$-cells), and faces ($2$-cells) in the decomposition.\n\n-   **Faces (F):** The interior of the square $Q$ forms a single $2$-cell in $M$. Thus, $F=1$.\n-   **Edges (E):** The boundary of $Q$ consists of four edges. The identification $(x,0)\\sim(x,1)$ merges the top and bottom edges into a single $1$-cell in $M$. The identification $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$ merges the left and right edges into a second $1$-cell in $M$. Thus, there are $E=2$ edges in the cell structure of $M$.\n-   **Vertices (V):** As established in Part 1, all four vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(0,1)$ of the square are identified to a single point in $M$. Thus, there is $V=1$ vertex in the cell structure of $M$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the Euler characteristic:\n$$\n\\chi(M) = V - E + F = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n$$\n\n### 4. Surface Identification\n\nThe classification theorem for closed surfaces states that every compact, connected $2$-manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to exactly one surface from a standard list. The surface is uniquely determined by its orientability and Euler characteristic.\n\nWe have found that $M$ is a nonorientable surface with an Euler characteristic of $\\chi(M)=0$. The classification includes the family of nonorientable surfaces, which are the connected sums of $k$ real projective planes, denoted $P^k = \\underbrace{P^2 \\# \\dots \\# P^2}_{k \\text{ copies}}$. The Euler characteristic of such a surface is given by the formula $\\chi(P^k) = 2 - k$.\n\nTo identify $M$, we set its Euler characteristic equal to this formula:\n$$\n\\chi(M) = 2 - k = 0\n$$\nSolving for $k$ gives $k=2$. Therefore, $M$ is homeomorphic to the connected sum of two projective planes, $P^2 \\# P^2$. This surface is commonly known as the Klein bottle. This identification is consistent with the standard polygonal presentation of the Klein bottle, which uses the same edge identifications as those given for $M$.\nThe final required quantity is the Euler characteristic of $M$.\n$$\n\\chi(M)=0\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3060149"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple gluing, we can form quotient manifolds by identifying points related by a group action.

No, the quotient space is not a manifold because the fixed points of the identification map become cone-like singularities.\n\nD. No, the quotient space is not a manifold because the quotient space is not Hausdorff.\n\nE. Yes, the quotient space is a manifold and is homeomorphic to the real projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^2$.", "solution": "Define $f:T^{2}\\to T^{2}$ by $f(z_{1},z_{2})=(z_{1}^{-1},z_{2}^{-1})$. Since for $z\\in S^{1}$ we have $z^{-1}=\\bar z$, this is the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-action generated by coordinatewise complex conjugation, equivalently by $(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})\\mapsto(-\\theta_{1},-\\,\\theta_{2})$ in angular coordinates $\\theta_{i}\\in \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$. The quotient $X=T^{2}/\\sim$ is the orbit space of this finite group action.\n\nFirst, determine the fixed points of $f$. A point $(z_{1},z_{2})$ is fixed iff $(z_{1},z_{2})=(z_{1}^{-1},z_{2}^{-1})$, i.e., $z_{1}^{2}=1$ and $z_{2}^{2}=1$, so $z_{1},z_{2}\\in\\{\\pm 1\\}$. Hence there are exactly four fixed points, namely $(\\pm 1,\\pm 1)$.\n\nNext, verify basic separation properties. Since $T^{2}$ is compact Hausdorff and $f$ generates a continuous action of the finite group $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, the orbit equivalence relation is closed and the quotient $X$ is compact and Hausdorff. Therefore, statement D is false.\n\nCheck that $X$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $2$. If $p\\in T^{2}$ is not fixed by $f$, choose a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ so small that $U\\cap f(U)=\\varnothing$. Then the quotient map $q:T^{2}\\to X$ restricts to a homeomorphism $U\\to q(U)$, so points not lying over fixed points have neighborhoods homeomorphic to open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nAt a fixed point, use local coordinates. Around $(1,1)$, use angular coordinates $(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})$ with $\\theta_{i}\\in(-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)$ mapping to $(e^{i\\theta_{1}},e^{i\\theta_{2}})$. In these coordinates, $f$ acts by $(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})\\mapsto(-\\theta_{1},-\\,\\theta_{2})$. Identify $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $\\mathbb{C}$ via $w=\\theta_{1}+i\\theta_{2}$ and consider the map $s:\\mathbb{C}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ given by $s(w)=w^{2}$. In real coordinates this is\n$$\ns(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})=\\big(\\theta_{1}^{2}-\\theta_{2}^{2},\\,2\\theta_{1}\\theta_{2}\\big).\n$$\nWe have $s(-\\theta_{1},-\\,\\theta_{2})=s(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})$, so $s$ is constant on the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-orbits and hence factors through the quotient to a continuous map $\\tilde s: \\big((-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)^{2}/\\{\\pm 1\\}\\big)\\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Moreover, for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon>0$, $s$ maps $(-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)^{2}$ onto a neighborhood of $0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and identifies exactly the pairs $(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})$ and $(-\\theta_{1},-\\,\\theta_{2})$. Therefore, $\\tilde s$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, a neighborhood of $0$. Hence the quotient is locally Euclidean of dimension $2$ at the image of the fixed point. The same argument applies at the other three fixed points. Consequently, $X$ is a $2$-manifold. This refutes statement C.\n\nTo identify the manifold, compute its Euler characteristic.

We have $\\chi(T^{2})=0$ and $\\mathrm{Fix}(f)$ consists of $4$ points, so $\\chi(\\mathrm{Fix}(f))=4$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\chi(X)=\\chi(T^{2}/\\mathbb{Z}_{2})=\\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\chi(T^{2})+\\chi(\\mathrm{Fix}(f))\\big)=\\frac{1}{2}(0+4)=2.\n$$\nThe space $X$ is compact, connected (as the continuous image of connected $T^{2}$), and a closed $2$-manifold with $\\chi(X)=2$.

We use standard spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$, where $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$ is the polar angle measured from the positive $z$-axis and $\\varphi \\in (0,2\\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle in the $xy$-plane from the positive $x$-axis.

The horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}_R$ is the orthogonal complement of the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_R = \\ker(d\\pi_R)$ with respect to the metric $g_G$.\n\nThe metric on $G=SO(3)$ is left-invariant, originating from the inner product $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3) = T_e G$. The vertical space at the identity, $\\mathcal{V}_e$, is the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ of the subgroup $H=SO(2)$. The horizontal space at the identity, $\\mathcal{H}_e$, is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Due to the left-invariance of the metric, the horizontal space at any $R \\in G$ is $\\mathcal{H}_R = dL_R(\\mathcal{H}_e)$, where $L_R$ is left multiplication by $R$.\n\nThe differential of $\\pi$ at an element $R \\in G$ applied to a vector $Y = dL_R(A) \\in T_R G$ (for $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$) is $d\\pi_R(Y) = \\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \\pi(R\\exp(tA)) = R(A e_3)$.\nA vector $Y=dL_R(A)$ is a horizontal lift of $u \\in T_p S^2$ if $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ and $d\\pi_R(Y) = u$.

The standard basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ consists of the infinitesimal generators of rotations about the coordinate axes:\n$$\nL_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$H=SO(2)$ is the group of rotations about the $z$-axis, so its Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{h} = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_3\\}$. This is the vertical subalgebra $\\mathcal{V}_e$.\nThe horizontal subalgebra $\\mathcal{H}_e$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$. For any $A \\in \\mathfrak{h}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$, we must have $\\langle A, B \\rangle = 0$.

The orthogonality, e.g. $\\langle L_1, L_2 \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_1 L_2) = 0$, can be checked similarly.\nThus, $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$.\n\nTo find $\\lambda$, we compute the metric components at a convenient, non-singular point. Let's choose the point $p = (1,0,0) \\in S^2$, which corresponds to coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$. The tangent vectors for the coordinate system at this point are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\theta}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ \\cos(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -e_3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\varphi}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = e_2\n$$\nThe metric components are $g_{\\theta\\theta} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, -e_3)_p$, $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(e_2, e_2)_p$, and $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, e_2)_p$.\n\nWe need an $R \\in SO(3)$ such that $\\pi(R) = R e_3 = p = e_1$. A rotation by $\\pi/2$ about the $y$-axis works:\n$$\nR = R_y(\\pi/2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\sin(\\pi/2) \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\cos(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIndeed, $R e_3 = (1,0,0)^T = e_1 = p$.\n\nNow we find the horizontal pre-images in $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$ for our tangent vectors.\nFor $u = -e_3$, we seek $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R A e_3 = -e_3$. Let $A = c_1 L_1 + c_2 L_2$.\n$A e_3 = c_1(L_1 e_3) + c_2(L_2 e_3) = c_1(-e_2) + c_2(e_1) = (c_2, -c_1, 0)^T$.\n$R(A e_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_2 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ -c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe set this equal to $-e_3 = (0,0,-1)^T$, which gives $-c_1 = 0$ and $-c_2 = -1$, so $c_1=0, c_2=1$. The pre-image is $A = L_2$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\langle A, A \\rangle = \\langle L_2, L_2 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nFor $v = e_2$, we seek $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R B e_3 = e_2$. Let $B = d_1 L_1 + d_2 L_2$.\n$R(B e_3) = (0, -d_1, -d_2)^T$.\nWe set this equal to $e_2 = (0,1,0)^T$, which gives $-d_1 = 1$ and $-d_2=0$, so $d_1=-1, d_2=0$. The pre-image is $B = -L_1$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = \\langle B, B \\rangle = \\langle -L_1, -L_1 \\rangle = \\langle L_1, L_1 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nThe off-diagonal component is $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = \\langle A, B \\rangle = \\langle L_2, -L_1 \\rangle = -\\langle L_2, L_1 \\rangle = 0$ due to orthogonality.\n\nSo at $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$, the metric is $ds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta}d\\theta^2 + g_{\\varphi\\varphi}d\\varphi^2 = 1 \\cdot d\\theta^2 + 1 \\cdot d\\varphi^2$.\nWe compare this to the asserted general form $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2)$. At $\\theta = \\pi/2$, $\\sin\\theta = 1$, so this form becomes $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$.\nComparing our computed metric with this expression, we find $1 \\cdot (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2) = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$, which implies $\\lambda=1$.\nSince the metric on $SO(3)$ is bi-invariant and the action of $SO(3)$ on $S^2$ is transitive, the induced metric is $SO(3)$-invariant. The unique (up to scaling) $SO(3)$-invariant metric on $S^2$ is the standard round metric. Therefore, the constant $\\lambda$ determined at one point is valid for the entire sphere. The specific normalization $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is precisely what yields the standard unit sphere metric on $S^2$, for which $\\lambda=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3060085"}]}
