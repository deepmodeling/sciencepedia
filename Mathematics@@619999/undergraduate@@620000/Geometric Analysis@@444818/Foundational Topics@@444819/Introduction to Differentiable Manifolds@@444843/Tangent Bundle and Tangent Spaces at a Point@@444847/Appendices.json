The point $p = (p_{1}, p_{2})$ is an element of $S^{1}$, so its coordinates satisfy $p_{1}^{2} + p_{2}^{2} = 1$.\n\nWe are instructed to use one of two foundational definitions. We will proceed using the definition of the tangent space as the kernel of the differential of a defining function, as this method is direct and powerful for manifolds defined as level sets.\n\nLet us define a smooth function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} - 1$. The unit circle $S^{1}$ is precisely the level set of this function for the value $0$, i.e., $S^{1} = f^{-1}(0)$.\n\nAccording to the theory of differentiable manifolds, for a manifold defined as a regular level set $f^{-1}(c)$, the tangent space at a point $p$ on the manifold is given by the kernel of the differential of $f$ at $p$, denoted $df_p$. Thus, we have the definition:\n$$T_{p}S^{1} = \\ker(df_p)$$\nThe differential $df_p$ is a linear map from the tangent space of the ambient space at $p$, $T_p\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, to the tangent space of the codomain at $f(p)$, $T_{f(p)}\\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The action of this differential on a tangent vector $v = (v_{1}, v_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is given by the dot product of the gradient of $f$ at $p$ with the vector $v$:\n$$df_p(v) = \\nabla f(p) \\cdot v$$\nFirst, we compute the gradient of $f$. The partial derivatives of $f(x_{1}, x_{2})$ are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{1}} = 2x_{1}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{2}} = 2x_{2}$$\nSo, the gradient vector is $\\nabla f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (2x_{1}, 2x_{2})$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the gradient at the specific point $p = (p_{1}, p_{2}) \\in S^{1}$:\n$$\\nabla f(p) = (2p_{1}, 2p_{2})$$\nSince $p \\in S^{1}$, $p$ is not the zero vector, which means $\\nabla f(p) \\neq (0, 0)$. This confirms that $p$ is a regular point of $f$, and $S^{1}$ is a smooth $1$-dimensional manifold.\n\nNow, we find the kernel of $df_p$. The kernel is the set of all vectors $v = (v_{1}, v_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $df_p(v) = 0$.\n$$df_p(v) = \\nabla f(p) \\cdot v = (2p_{1}, 2p_{2}) \\cdot (v_{1}, v_{2}) = 0$$\nThis dot product gives the equation:\n$$2p_{1}v_{1} + 2p_{2}v_{2} = 0$$\nDividing by $2$, we obtain the condition that a vector $v = (v_{1}, v_{2})$ must satisfy to be in $T_{p}S^{1}$:\n$$p_{1}v_{1} + p_{2}v_{2} = 0$$\nThis equation, $p \\cdot v = 0$, signifies that the tangent vectors $v$ are precisely those vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that are orthogonal to the position vector $p$. The set of all such vectors forms a one-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nTherefore, we can express the tangent space $T_{p}S^{1}$ as the set of vectors satisfying this orthogonality condition. In terms of the coordinates of $p=(p_{1}, p_{2})$, the tangent space is given by the following set:\n$$T_{p}S^{1} = \\{ (v_{1}, v_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : p_{1}v_{1} + p_{2}v_{2} = 0 \\}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for $T_{p}S^{1}$, which explicitly identifies it as the one-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ orthogonal to the vector $p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left\\{ (v_{1}, v_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : p_{1} v_{1} + p_{2} v_{2} = 0 \\right\\}}\n$$", "id": "3064913"}, {"introduction": "An alternative to defining manifolds by level sets is to construct them via parametrizations, essentially \"drawing\" the surface with coordinate functions.
