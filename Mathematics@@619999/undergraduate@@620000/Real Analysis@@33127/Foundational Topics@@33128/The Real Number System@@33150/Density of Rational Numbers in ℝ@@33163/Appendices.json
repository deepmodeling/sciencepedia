It guarantees that for any two distinct real numbers $x$ and $y$, there exists a rational number $q$ such that $x < q < y$.

Find a rational number $q$ of the form $m/n$ that lies in the open interval $(a, b)$. The integers $m$ and $n$ must be determined by the following procedure:\n1.

Let's consider two consecutive elements in this set, for example for $m=0$ and $m=1$. These are $0$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. The open interval $(0.1, 0.2)$ is a valid open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. However, there is no integer $m$ for which $0.1 < m\\sqrt{3} < 0.2$. The smallest positive element in $S_A$ is $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$, which is not in this interval.

Let $\\epsilon = b-a > 0$. We need to find a rational number $p/q$ in $(a,b)$ where $q$ is a positive odd integer.\nBy the Archimedean property of real numbers, we can find a positive integer $n$ such that $n > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{b-a}$.\nIf $n$ is odd, we let $q=n$. If $n$ is even, we let $q=n+1$, which is odd. In both cases, we have found a positive odd integer $q$ such that $q > \\frac{1}{b-a}$.\nThis implies $q(b-a) > 1$, or $qb - qa > 1$.\nThe interval $(qa, qb)$ has a length greater than 1, so it must contain at least one integer. Let's call this integer $p$.\nSo, we have $qa < p < qb$.\nSince $q$ is a positive integer, we can divide the inequality by $q$ without changing its direction:\n$a < \\frac{p}{q} < b$.\nWe have successfully found an element $\\frac{p}{q}$ of the set $S_B$ within the interval $(a,b)$.

Let $(a,b)$ be an arbitrary open interval with $a<b$. Let $\\epsilon = b-a > 0$.\nAgain, by the Archimedean property, we can find a non-negative integer $k$ large enough such that $10^k > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, which means $\\frac{1}{10^k} < \\epsilon = b-a$.\nConsider the set of points $\\{m/10^k \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. These points are spaced evenly on the real line with a separation of $1/10^k$. Since the length of the interval $(a,b)$ is $b-a$, which is greater than the spacing $1/10^k$, there must be at least one point of the form $p/10^k$ (for some integer $p$) inside $(a,b)$.\nMore formally, consider the integer $p = \\lfloor a \\cdot 10^k \\rfloor + 1$. By definition of the floor function, we have $\\lfloor a \\cdot 10^k \\rfloor \\le a \\cdot 10^k < \\lfloor a \\cdot 10^k \\rfloor + 1$. This implies $a \\cdot 10^k < p \\le a \\cdot 10^k + 1$.\nDividing by $10^k$ gives $a < \\frac{p}{10^k} \\le a + \\frac{1}{10^k}$.\nSince we chose $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{10^k} < b-a$, it follows that $a + \\frac{1}{10^k} < a + (b-a) = b$.\nCombining these inequalities, we get $a < \\frac{p}{10^k} < b$.\nWe have found an element of $S_C$ in the interval $(a,b)$.

Let $(a,b)$ be an arbitrary open interval. We want to show it contains an irrational number.\nConsider the interval $(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{2}})$. Since the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, this interval must contain a rational number. Let's pick a non-zero rational number $r$ in this interval. (If the only rational in the interval is 0, we can make the interval smaller while staying inside the original to find a non-zero rational).\nSo, we have a rational number $r \\neq 0$ such that $\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} < r < \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nMultiplying this inequality by $\\sqrt{2}$ (which is positive) preserves the inequality directions:\n$a < r\\sqrt{2} < b$.\nThe number $x = r\\sqrt{2}$ is the product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number, which is always irrational.\nThus, we have found an irrational number $x$ in the interval $(a,b)$. Since $(a,b)$ was arbitrary, the set of irrational numbers is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nE. The set is $S_E = \\{r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid |r| > 100\\}$. Consider the open interval $(-1, 1)$. For any number $x \\in (-1, 1)$, its absolute value is $|x| < 1$. The set $S_E$ contains no numbers with absolute value less than or equal to 100. Therefore, the interval $(-1, 1)$ contains no elements of $S_E$.
