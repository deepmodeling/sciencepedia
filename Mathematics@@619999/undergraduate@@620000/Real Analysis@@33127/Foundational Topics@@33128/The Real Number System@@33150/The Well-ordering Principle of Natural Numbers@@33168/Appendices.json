Let's test $n=1$.\n$f(1) = 5(1)^2 - 1 = 4$.\nThe condition for $n=1$ becomes: $d \\cdot 4$ must be divisible by $3$. Since $3$ is a prime number and does not divide $4$, it must divide $d$. Therefore, $d$ must be a multiple of $3$.\n\nNow let's analyze the second condition. For $d \\cdot f(n)$ to be divisible by $4$ for all integers $n$, we can test values of $n$.

Since $2$ is a prime number and does not divide $9$, it must divide $d$. Therefore, $d$ must be a multiple of $2$.\n\nCombining our findings, $d$ must be a multiple of $3$ and a multiple of $2$. For $d$ to satisfy both conditions, it must be a common multiple of $2$ and $3$. Since we are looking for the *smallest positive* integer $d$, we should choose the least common multiple of $2$ and $3$.\n$$d = \\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$$\nSo, the smallest possible value for $d$ is $6$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that $d=6$ actually works for all integers $n$, not just for the specific values we tested.

Let's check the parity of this product.\n- If $n$ is an even integer, then the product $n(5n-1)$ is even.\n- If $n$ is an odd integer, then $5n$ is also odd. This means that $5n-1$ is an even integer. Consequently, the product $n(5n-1)$ is even.\nIn both cases, $5n^2-n$ is an even number.

Therefore, $a_1$ is always a record-breaking term. This immediately eliminates option A and any option suggesting there could be zero record-breaking terms (like D).\n\nThe crucial question is whether the number of such terms must be infinite.
