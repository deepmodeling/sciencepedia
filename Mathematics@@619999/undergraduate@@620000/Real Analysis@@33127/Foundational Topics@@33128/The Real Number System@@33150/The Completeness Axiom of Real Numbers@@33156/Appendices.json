An element $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is called an **upper bound** of $S$ if for every element $s \\in S$, the inequality $s \\leq u$ holds.\n2.  If the set of all upper bounds of $S$ is non-empty, we say that $S$ is **bounded above**.\n3.  The **supremum** of $S$, denoted as $\\sup(S)$, is the least upper bound of $S$.

We need to find the supremum (least upper bound) and infimum (greatest lower bound) of $S$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the first few terms of the sequence to get a feel for its behavior:\nFor $n=1$, $a_1 = \\frac{1}{2^1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor $n=2$, $a_2 = \\frac{2}{2^2} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor $n=3$, $a_3 = \\frac{3}{2^3} = \\frac{3}{8}$. Since $\\frac{3}{8}  \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $a_3  a_2$.\nFor $n=4$, $a_4 = \\frac{4}{2^4} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{8}  \\frac{3}{8}$, we have $a_4  a_3$.\n\nThis suggests the sequence might be decreasing for $n \\ge 2$. To verify this, let's analyze the ratio of consecutive terms, $\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$, for $n \\ge 1$:\n$$ \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{(n+1)/2^{n+1}}{n/2^n} = \\frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}} \\cdot \\frac{2^n}{n} = \\frac{n+1}{2n} $$\nThe sequence is decreasing when $a_{n+1}  a_n$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}  1$.\n$$ \\frac{n+1}{2n}  1 \\iff n+1  2n \\iff 1  n $$\nThis inequality holds for all $n \\ge 2$. For $n=1$, the ratio is $\\frac{1+1}{2(1)} = 1$, so $a_2 = a_1$.\nSo, we have $a_1 = a_2 = 1/2$, and for all $n \\ge 2$, $a_{n+1}  a_n$. This means the sequence is $a_1 = a_2  a_3  a_4  \\dots$.\nThe largest value in the set is therefore $a_1 = a_2 = 1/2$. Any element $a_n$ in $S$ satisfies $a_n \\le 1/2$. This means $1/2$ is an upper bound for $S$. Since $1/2$ is itself an element of $S$ (e.g., $a_1=1/2$), no number smaller than $1/2$ can be an upper bound. Therefore, $1/2$ is the least upper bound, or supremum.\n$$ \\sup S = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis value is also the maximum of the set.\n\nNext, we seek the infimum of $S$. For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $n0$ and $2^n0$, so $a_n = \\frac{n}{2^n}  0$. This shows that $0$ is a lower bound for the set $S$. To determine if it is the greatest lower bound, we must check if any number greater than $0$ can be a lower bound. This is equivalent to showing that the sequence $a_n$ approaches $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. If $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0$, then for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an $N$ such that for $n  N$, $a_n  \\epsilon$. This would mean no positive number $\\epsilon$ can be a lower bound, making $0$ the greatest lower bound.\n\nLet's prove that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{2^n} = 0$.\nWe use the binomial expansion for $2^n = (1+1)^n$. For $n \\ge 2$, the expansion is:\n$$ 2^n = (1+1)^n = \\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{1} + \\binom{n}{2} + \\dots + \\binom{n}{n} $$\nSince all terms in the binomial expansion are positive, we can get an inequality by taking just one of the terms. For our purpose, the term $\\binom{n}{2}$ is useful:\n$$ 2^n \\ge \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$\nThis inequality holds for $n \\ge 2$.\nNow, consider our term $a_n = \\frac{n}{2^n}$. We have $0  a_n$ for all $n$. For $n \\ge 2$, we can write:\n$$ 0  \\frac{n}{2^n} \\le \\frac{n}{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} = \\frac{2n}{n(n-1)} = \\frac{2}{n-1} $$\nSo, we have the inequality $0  a_n \\le \\frac{2}{n-1}$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{2}{n-1} \\to 0$.\nBy the Squeeze Theorem, since $a_n$ is squeezed between $0$ and a sequence that tends to $0$, we must have:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{2^n} = 0 $$\nSince the limit of the sequence is $0$, for any number $\\epsilon  0$, we can find a natural number $N$ such that for all $n  N$, $a_n  \\epsilon$. This proves that no positive number can be a lower bound for $S$. Thus, $0$ must be the greatest lower bound.\n$$ \\inf S = 0 $$\nNote that $0$ is not an element of $S$ since $a_n  0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.
