This practice explores a cornerstone proof in real analysis, demonstrating how the Completeness Axiom guarantees the existence of square roots for all positive numbers. By constructing a specific set of rational numbers whose squares are less than a given positive number $c$, you will use the concept of the supremum (the least upper bound) to rigorously show that there must be a real number whose square is exactly $c$. [@problem_id:1299079]", "problem": "In the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, the Completeness Axiom states that every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum) in $\\mathbb{R}$. Consider a specific set $A$, which is a subset of the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, defined as:\n$$A = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x \\geq 0 \\text{ and } x^2  13 \\right\\}$$\nRegarding $A$ as a set of real numbers, determine the value of its supremum.", "solution": "Let the given set be $A = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x \\geq 0 \\text{ and } x^2  13 \\right\\}$. We want to find $s = \\sup A$, where the supremum is taken in the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the existence of the supremum using the Completeness Axiom.\n1.  The set $A$ is non-empty. For instance, the rational number $3$ satisfies $3 \\ge 0$ and $3^2 = 9  13$. Thus, $3 \\in A$.\n2.  The set $A$ is bounded above. Consider the number $4$. For any $x \\in A$, we have $x^2  13$. If we were to assume there exists an $x \\in A$ such that $x \\geq 4$, then it would follow that $x^2 \\geq 4^2 = 16$. This contradicts the condition $x^2  13$. Therefore, every element $x \\in A$ must satisfy $x  4$, which means $4$ is an upper bound for $A$.\n\nSince $A$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above, the Completeness Axiom guarantees that its supremum, $s = \\sup A$, exists as a real number.\n\nNext, we determine the precise value of $s$. Since $3 \\in A$, we know $s \\ge 3  0$. By the law of trichotomy for real numbers, exactly one of the following must be true: $s^2  13$, $s^2  13$, or $s^2 = 13$. We will eliminate the first two possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Assume $s^2  13$.\nLet $\\epsilon = 13 - s^2$. Since we assumed $s^2  13$, we have $\\epsilon  0$. Our goal is to find a rational number $q \\in A$ such that $q  s$. This would contradict the fact that $s$ is an upper bound for $A$.\nConsider the number $s+h$ for some small $h0$. We have $(s+h)^2 = s^2 + 2sh + h^2$. To simplify, we can choose $h1$, which implies $h^2  h$.\nThen $(s+h)^2  s^2 + 2sh + h = s^2 + h(2s+1)$.\nWe want to find an $h$ such that this expression is less than 13. That is, we want $s^2 + h(2s+1)  13$, which simplifies to $h(2s+1)  13 - s^2 = \\epsilon$. This is satisfied if $h  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2s+1}$.\nBy the Archimedean property, we can find a natural number $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2s+1}$. Let's choose such an $n$. With $h = 1/n$, we have $(s+1/n)^2  13$.\nThe number $s+1/n$ is a real number greater than $s$. By the density of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists a rational number $q$ such that $s  q  s+1/n$.\nSince $q  s  0$, we have $q \\ge 0$. Also, since the function $f(x)=x^2$ is increasing for positive numbers, $q^2  (s+1/n)^2  13$.\nSo, $q$ is a rational number with $q \\ge 0$ and $q^2  13$. By definition, $q \\in A$.\nHowever, we found $q  s$, which contradicts $s$ being an upper bound for A. Thus, the assumption $s^2  13$ must be false.\n\nCase 2: Assume $s^2  13$.\nLet $\\epsilon = s^2 - 13$. Since we assumed $s^2  13$, we have $\\epsilon  0$. Our goal is to find an upper bound for $A$ that is smaller than $s$. This would contradict the fact that $s$ is the *least* upper bound.\nConsider the number $s-h$ for some small $h  0$. We have $(s-h)^2 = s^2 - 2sh + h^2$. Since $h^2  0$, we have $(s-h)^2  s^2 - 2sh$.\nWe want to find an $h$ such that $s^2-2sh  13$. This is equivalent to $s^2 - 13  2sh$, or $\\epsilon  2sh$. This is satisfied if $h  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2s}$.\nBy the Archimedean property, we can find a natural number $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2s}$. Let's choose such an $n$. With $h=1/n$, we have $(s-1/n)^2  s^2 - \\frac{2s}{n}  s^2 - 2s\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{2s}\\right) = s^2 - \\epsilon = s^2 - (s^2 - 13) = 13$.\nSo, $(s-1/n)^2  13$. Let $u = s-1/n$. We can choose $n$ large enough so that $u0$ (since $s  0$).\nFor any $x \\in A$, we have $x \\ge 0$ and $x^2  13$. Since $u^2  13$, we have $x^2  u^2$. As both $x$ and $u$ are non-negative, this implies $x  u$.\nThis shows that $u = s-1/n$ is an upper bound for the set $A$. But $u  s$, which contradicts the fact that $s$ is the least upper bound. Thus, the assumption $s^2  13$ must be false.\n\nSince we have shown that $s^2  13$ and $s^2  13$ are both false, the only remaining possibility by the law of trichotomy is $s^2 = 13$.\nSince the elements of $A$ are non-negative, their supremum $s$ must also be non-negative. Therefore, $s$ is the unique non-negative real number whose square is 13. By definition, this number is the square root of 13.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$$", "id": "1299079"}, {"introduction": "While the supremum-based proof confirms that square roots exist, it doesn't immediately give us a practical way to calculate them.
