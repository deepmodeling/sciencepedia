According to the definition of subtraction, $a-b = a + (-b)$. Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$c(a-b) = c(a + (-b))$$\n\n**Step 2: Apply the distributive law.**\nThe problem states that the next step is to apply the distributive law, which is $c(x+y) = cx + cy$. In our expression, $c(a + (-b))$, we can identify $x=a$ and $y=-b$. Applying the distributive law yields:\n$$c(a + (-b)) = ca + c(-b)$$\n\nThis expression, $ca + c(-b)$, is the result *immediately* after applying the distributive law. Comparing this with the given options, we find that it matches option A.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, let's continue the derivation to the final result to confirm this is a valid path.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the given theorem.**\nThe current expression is $ca + c(-b)$. We are given the theorem that $x(-y) = -(xy)$. We can apply this to the term $c(-b)$ by setting $x=c$ and $y=b$. This gives $c(-b) = -(cb)$. Substituting this back into our expression, we get:\n$$ca + c(-b) = ca + (-(cb))$$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the definition of subtraction again.**\nThe current expression is $ca + (-(cb))$. The definition of subtraction states that $u-v = u+(-v)$. By identifying $u=ca$ and $v=cb$, we can see that our expression is exactly in the form $u+(-v)$. Therefore, we can write it as a subtraction:\n$$ca + (-(cb)) = ca - cb$$\n\nThe derivation is complete, showing $c(a-b) = ca - cb$. The question asks for the expression immediately following the application of the distributive law (Step 2). As shown, this expression is $ca + c(-b)$.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n-   **B: $ca - c(-b)$**: This would arise from an incorrect application of the distributive law, distributing the $c$ but incorrectly handling the plus sign.\n-   **C: $ca + (-c)b$**: This incorrectly moves the negative sign from $b$ to $c$. The given theorem is $x(-y) = -(xy)$, not $x(-y) = (-x)y$.\n-   **D: $ac - bc$**: This is equivalent to the final answer (using commutativity of multiplication), but it is not the intermediate step immediately following the distributive law. It skips over Steps 3 and 4.\n-   **E: $c(a) + b(-c)$**: This is another incorrect manipulation, similar to option C.\n\nTherefore, the only correct expression for the specified step is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1331798"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the \"why\" behind mathematical rules is as crucial as knowing the rules themselves. Many common errors in algebra arise not from miscalculation, but from a broken intuition about the underlying axioms.

By connecting a procedural mistake to a foundational principle, you will sharpen your ability to reason correctly and avoid similar pitfalls. [@problem_id:2323245]", "problem": "In the field of real numbers $(\\mathbb{R}, +, \\cdot)$, algebraic manipulations are governed by a set of fundamental rules known as the field axioms.

An incorrect simplification often performed is:\n$$\n\\frac{a+b}{a+c} = \\frac{b}{c} \\quad (\\text{Incorrect!})\n$$\nThis mistake arises from improperly \"canceling\" the term $a$ from the numerator and denominator. In a formal system, \"cancellation\" is not an axiom itself but rather a consequence of applying a sequence of axioms. Specifically, simplifying a fraction $\\frac{X}{Y}$ requires finding a common *multiplicative factor* $k \\neq 0$ such that $X = k \\cdot X'$ and $Y = k \\cdot Y'$, which then allows the simplification to $\\frac{X'}{Y'}$.\n\nThe ability to rewrite a sum as a product (the process of factoring) is governed by one of the axioms below. The error shown above stems from a failure to correctly apply the rules of factoring before attempting to cancel.

Multiplicative Commutativity", "solution": "The only legitimate way to cancel a common factor in a fraction is to use multiplicative inverses after exhibiting an actual common multiplicative factor. In a field, division is defined by inverses: for $Y \\neq 0$, $\\frac{X}{Y} = X \\cdot Y^{-1}$. If $X = k X'$ and $Y = k Y'$ with $k \\neq 0$, then\n$$\n\\frac{X}{Y} = \\frac{k X'}{k Y'} = (k X') \\cdot (k Y')^{-1} = k X' \\cdot (k^{-1} Y'^{-1}) = (k k^{-1}) X' Y'^{-1} = X' Y'^{-1} = \\frac{X'}{Y'}.\n$$\nThus cancellation requires a common multiplicative factor $k$.\n\nFor $\\frac{a+b}{a+c}$, the term $a$ is not a common multiplicative factor of $a+b$ and $a+c$ unless one first rewrites each sum as a product. The rule that allows rewriting a sum as a product is the distributive property of multiplication over addition:\n$$\nx(y+z) = xy + xz,\n$$\nand, conversely, $xy + xz = x(y+z)$ (factoring). Applying this properly with $a \\neq 0$ gives\n$$\na+b = a\\left(1 + b a^{-1}\\right), \\qquad a+c = a\\left(1 + c a^{-1}\\right),\n$$\nwhich uses the existence of $a^{-1}$ and, crucially, the distributive property to factor $a$.

The erroneous step $\\frac{a+b}{a+c} = \\frac{b}{c}$ treats addition as if it allowed direct cancellation of an addend, which amounts to misapplying the distributive law (factoring) by imagining $a+b$ and $a+c$ already share the multiplicative factor $a$ without properly factoring.\n\nTherefore, the field axiom most directly misunderstood is the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Associativity and commutativity do not permit cancellation across addition, and while multiplicative inverses justify cancellation once a common factor is factored out, the incorrect simplification arises before that step, from a failure to apply distributivity correctly.\n\nAs a further check, if one assumes $\\frac{a+b}{a+c} = \\frac{b}{c}$ and cross-multiplies (valid when denominators are nonzero), then\n$$\n(a+b)c = (a+c)b \\implies ac + bc = ab + bc \\implies ac = ab \\implies a(c-b) = 0,\n$$\nwhich, given $a \\neq 0$, forces $c=b$.
