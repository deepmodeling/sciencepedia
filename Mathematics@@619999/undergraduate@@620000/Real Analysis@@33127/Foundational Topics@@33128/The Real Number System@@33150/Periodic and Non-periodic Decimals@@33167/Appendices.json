We will analyze the two implications, P $\\implies$ Q and Q $\\implies$ P, separately.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of P $\\implies$ Q**\n\nStatement P is \"The number $x$ is a rational number.\" A fundamental property of rational numbers is that their decimal expansions are eventually periodic. This means that for any rational $x \\in [0,1]$, its decimal expansion can be written as:\n$$x = 0.d_1 d_2 \\dots d_{N_0} \\overline{p_1 p_2 \\dots p_L}$$\nHere, $d_1, \\dots, d_{N_0}$ is the non-repeating (pre-period) part of length $N_0 \\ge 0$, and $p_1, \\dots, p_L$ is the repeating (period) part of length $L \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's compute the limit of the arithmetic mean $A_n(x)$ for such a number.\nLet $S_{N_0} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_0} d_k$ be the sum of the digits in the non-repeating part.\nLet $S_{L} = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} p_j$ be the sum of the digits in one cycle of the repeating part.\n\nFor any integer $n > N_0$, we can determine how many full repeating blocks are contained within the first $n$ digits. The number of digits after the pre-period is $n - N_0$. The number of full repeating blocks, $q$, and the number of remaining digits in the next block, $r$, are given by $n - N_0 = qL + r$, where $q$ is an integer and $0 \\le r < L$.\n\nThe sum of the first $n$ digits, $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} d_k$, can be expressed as the sum of digits from the pre-period, plus the sum of digits from the $q$ full periods, plus the sum of digits from the remaining $r$ digits of the next period.\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} d_k = S_{N_0} + q S_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j$$\nThe arithmetic mean $A_n(x)$ is this sum divided by $n$:\n$$A_n(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( S_{N_0} + q S_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j \\right)$$\nFrom $n - N_0 = qL + r$, we can express $q$ as $q = \\frac{n - N_0 - r}{L}$. Substituting this into the expression for $A_n(x)$:\n$$A_n(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( S_{N_0} + \\frac{n - N_0 - r}{L} S_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j \\right)$$\nLet's rearrange the terms to analyze the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$A_n(x) = \\frac{n S_L}{nL} + \\frac{1}{n} \\left( S_{N_0} - \\frac{N_0+r}{L}S_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j \\right)$$\n$$A_n(x) = \\frac{S_L}{L} + \\frac{1}{n} \\left( S_{N_0} - \\frac{N_0 S_L}{L} - \\frac{r S_L}{L} + \\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j \\right)$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{S_L}{L}$ is constant. Let's analyze the second term. All quantities inside the parentheses are bounded. $S_{N_0}$, $N_0$, $S_L$, and $L$ are constants for a given rational number $x$. The variable $r$ is bounded by $0 \\le r < L$, which means the term $\\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j$ is also bounded. Therefore, the entire expression inside the parentheses is bounded by some constant $C$. The second term is of the form $C/n$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{C}{n} \\to 0$.\nThus, the limit of the arithmetic mean exists and is given by:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} A_n(x) = \\frac{S_L}{L}$$\nThis is the average value of the digits in the repeating block.\nTherefore, if $x$ is rational, the sequence $\\{A_n(x)\\}$ converges. This means P $\\implies$ Q is true.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Q $\\implies$ P**\n\nStatement Q is \"The sequence $\\{A_n(x)\\}$ converges to a limit.\" Statement P is \"$x$ is a rational number.\" To check if Q $\\implies$ P, we must determine if the convergence of the mean of digits forces the number to be rational. We can test this by attempting to construct a counterexample: an irrational number $x$ for which the sequence $\\{A_n(x)\\}$ converges.\n\nLet's construct a number $x$ by concatenating blocks of digits. Let the $k$-th block, $B_k$, consist of $k$ ones followed by $k$ zeros.\n$B_1 = 10$\n$B_2 = 1100$\n$B_3 = 111000$\n...\n$B_k = \\underbrace{11\\dots1}_{k \\text{ times}}\\underbrace{00\\dots0}_{k \\text{ times}}$\n\nOur number $x$ is formed by concatenating these blocks:\n$$x = 0.B_1 B_2 B_3 \\dots = 0.101100111000\\dots$$\nSince the sequence of digits is not eventually periodic (the blocks of zeros and ones grow in length), the number $x$ is irrational. Now we need to check if $\\{A_n(x)\\}$ converges.\n\nLet's analyze the mean $A_n(x)$ at specific points. Let $N_k$ be the total number of digits at the end of block $B_k$. The length of block $B_j$ is $2j$.\n$N_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (\\text{length of } B_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} 2j = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{k} j = 2 \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = k(k+1)$.\n\nLet $S_k$ be the sum of digits up to the end of block $B_k$. The sum of digits in block $B_j$ is $j$ (since it contains $j$ ones).\n$S_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (\\text{sum of digits in } B_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} j = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.\n\nThe arithmetic mean at the end of block $B_k$ is:\n$$A_{N_k}(x) = \\frac{S_k}{N_k} = \\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis shows that there is a subsequence of the means $\\{A_{N_k}(x)\\}$ that converges to $1/2$. To prove the entire sequence converges, we must show that the mean $A_n(x)$ is close to $1/2$ for all large $n$.\n\nLet $n$ be a large integer. There must be some $k$ such that $N_{k-1} < n \\le N_k$. This means the $n$-th digit lies within the block $B_k$. Let $n = N_{k-1} + m$, where $1 \\le m \\le 2k$.\nThe total sum of digits up to $n$ is the sum up to $N_{k-1}$ plus the sum of the first $m$ digits of block $B_k$.\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = S_{k-1} + (\\text{sum of first } m \\text{ digits of } B_k)$.\n\nThere are two cases for the position $m$ within block $B_k$:\nCase 1: $1 \\le m \\le k$. The first $k$ digits of $B_k$ are all 1s.\nThe sum of digits is $S_{k-1} + m = \\frac{(k-1)k}{2} + m$.\nThe mean is $A_n(x) = \\frac{\\frac{(k-1)k}{2} + m}{(k-1)k + m}$.\nAs $k \\to \\infty$ (and thus $n \\to \\infty$), the dominant term in both numerator and denominator is $k^2$. The expression is approximately $\\frac{k^2/2}{k^2} = 1/2$. More rigorously, we can bound it:\nFor $m=1$: $A_n = \\frac{k(k-1)/2 + 1}{k(k-1)+1} = \\frac{k^2-k+2}{2k^2-2k+2} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\nFor $m=k$: $A_n = \\frac{k(k-1)/2 + k}{k(k-1)+k} = \\frac{k^2+k}{2k^2} = \\frac{k+1}{2k} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\nFor any $m$ in between, the value of $A_n(x)$ is between these two extremes, both of which approach $1/2$.\n\nCase 2: $k < m \\le 2k$. The first $k$ digits of $B_k$ are 1s, and the subsequent digits are 0s. The sum of the first $m$ digits of $B_k$ is just $k$.\nThe sum of digits is $S_{k-1} + k = \\frac{(k-1)k}{2} + k = \\frac{k^2+k}{2} = S_k$.\nThe mean is $A_n(x) = \\frac{S_k}{N_{k-1} + m} = \\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k(k-1) + m}$.\nThe denominator ranges from $k(k-1)+k+1 = k^2+1$ to $k(k-1)+2k = k^2+k$.\nThe value of $A_n(x)$ is bounded:\n$\\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k^2+k} \\le A_n(x) \\le \\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k^2+1}$.\nThe lower bound is $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2(k^2+k)} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe upper bound is $\\frac{k^2+k}{2k^2+2} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\nBy the Squeeze Theorem, in this case as well, $A_n(x) \\to 1/2$.\n\nSince for any large $n$, $A_n(x)$ is squeezed between values that approach $1/2$, we conclude that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} A_n(x) = 1/2$.\nWe have constructed an irrational number $x$ for which Statement Q is true. Therefore, Q does not imply P.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that P $\\implies$ Q is true, but Q $\\implies$ P is false.
