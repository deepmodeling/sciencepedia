We want to find $\\inf A$ and $\\sup A$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the bounds for the elements of $A$. Let $x = \\frac{m}{m+n}$ be an arbitrary element of $A$. Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, $m  0$ and $n  0$.\nThe numerator $m$ is positive, and the denominator $m+n$ is also positive. Therefore, any element $x$ in $A$ must be positive: $x  0$. This means that $0$ is a lower bound for the set $A$.\n\nAlso, since $n  0$, we have $m  m+n$. As both sides are positive, we can divide by $m+n$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$ \\frac{m}{m+n}  \\frac{m+n}{m+n} $$\n$$ x  1 $$\nThis shows that $1$ is an upper bound for the set $A$.\nSince the set $A$ is bounded below by $0$ and bounded above by $1$, both its infimum and supremum exist by the completeness axiom of real numbers.\n\nNow we will prove that $\\inf A = 0$.\nWe have already shown that $0$ is a lower bound.

We need to find $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\frac{m}{m+n}  \\epsilon$.\nLet's fix $m=1$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{1}{1+n}  \\epsilon$.\nThis is equivalent to $1  \\epsilon(1+n)$, or $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}  1+n$, which simplifies to $n  \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$.\nBy the Archimedean property, for any real number (like $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$), there exists a natural number $n$ that is greater.

Therefore, $\\inf A = 0$.\n\nNext, we will prove that $\\sup A = 1$.\nWe have already shown that $1$ is an upper bound. To show it is the least upper bound (supremum), we must show that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an element $x \\in A$ such that $x  1 - \\epsilon$.

We need to find $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\frac{m}{m+n}  1-\\epsilon$.\nLet's fix $n=1$.

The set $S$ is defined as $S = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid q  0 \\text{ and } q^2 - 2q  4 \\}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the inequality $q^2 - 2q  4$. To do this, let's consider the corresponding equation in the real numbers, $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$. We can find the roots of this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nFor this equation, we have $a=1$, $b=-2$, and $c=-4$. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n$$ x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5} = 2\\sqrt{5}$, the roots are:\n$$ x = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{5} $$\nSo the two real roots are $x_1 = 1 - \\sqrt{5}$ and $x_2 = 1 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe function $f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 4$ describes an upward-opening parabola. The inequality $x^2 - 2x - 4  0$ is satisfied when $x$ is outside the interval defined by the roots. That is, the inequality holds for $x  1 - \\sqrt{5}$ or $x  1 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nNow, we must apply this to the definition of the set $S$, which requires its elements $q$ to be rational numbers ($q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) and also to be positive ($q  0$).\nLet's analyze the two roots. We know that $2  \\sqrt{5}  3$.\nThe first root is $x_1 = 1 - \\sqrt{5}$. Since $\\sqrt{5}  2$, this root is negative.

Thus, there are no elements in $S$ from this branch.\nThe branch $q  1 + \\sqrt{5}$ is compatible with $q  0$, since $1 + \\sqrt{5}$ is a positive number.\n\nTherefore, the definition of the set $S$ simplifies to:\n$$ S = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid q  1 + \\sqrt{5} \\} $$\nThis means $S$ is the set of all rational numbers that are strictly greater than the irrational number $1 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nWe are looking for the infimum of $S$, denoted $\\inf(S)$.\nLet $\\alpha = 1 + \\sqrt{5}$.
