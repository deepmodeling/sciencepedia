This is known as the density of irrational numbers in the set of real numbers.\n\nLet $r_1$ and $r_2$ be any two distinct rational numbers satisfying $r_1 < r_2$. Consider the a set of five proposed formulas for generating a number $x$.

Since $\\pi$ is irrational and $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $\\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi}$ is irrational; otherwise, if $\\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then $\\pi = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta/\\pi} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, a contradiction. Hence $x$ is irrational as the sum of a rational and a nonzero irrational. For the interval, since $\\pi > 1$, one has $0 < \\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi} < \\Delta$, so\n$$\nr_{1} < r_{1} + \\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi} < r_{1} + \\Delta = r_{2}.\n$$\nThus A always yields an irrational $x$ with $r_{1} < x < r_{2}$.\n\nFor B: $x = \\frac{r_{1} + r_{2}\\sqrt{2}}{1 + \\sqrt{2}}$. First show irrationality. Rationalize the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}}{(1+\\sqrt{2})(1-\\sqrt{2})} = \\sqrt{2} - 1.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nx = (r_{1} + r_{2}\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2} - 1) = (2r_{2} - r_{1}) + (r_{1} - r_{2})\\sqrt{2}.\n$$\nWrite $x = a + b\\sqrt{2}$ with $a = 2r_{2} - r_{1} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $b = r_{1} - r_{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ (since $r_{1} \\neq r_{2}$). If $x$ were rational, then $b\\sqrt{2} = x - a$ would be rational, forcing $\\sqrt{2}$ rational or $b=0$, both impossible; thus $x$ is irrational. For the interval, observe\n$$\nx = r_{1}(\\sqrt{2} - 1) + r_{2}(2 - \\sqrt{2}),\n$$\nand note $\\sqrt{2} > 1$ and $\\sqrt{2} < 2$, so both weights $\\sqrt{2} - 1$ and $2 - \\sqrt{2}$ are positive and they sum to $1$. Therefore $x$ is a convex combination of $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$, which implies\n$$\nr_{1} < x < r_{2}.\n$$\nThus B always yields an irrational $x$ with $r_{1} < x < r_{2}$.\n\nFor C: $x = r_{2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{e}$. Since $e$ is irrational and $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $\\frac{\\Delta}{e}$ is irrational; otherwise, if $\\frac{\\Delta}{e} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then $e = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta/e} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, a contradiction. Hence $x$ is irrational as a rational minus a nonzero irrational. For the interval, using $e > 1$ gives $0 < \\frac{\\Delta}{e} < \\Delta$, so\n$$\nr_{1} = r_{2} - \\Delta < r_{2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{e} < r_{2}.\n$$\nThus C always yields an irrational $x$ with $r_{1} < x < r_{2}$.\n\nFor D: $x = \\frac{r_{1} + r_{2}}{2} + \\frac{|r_{1}| + |r_{2}|}{2}\\sqrt{2}$. The coefficient $\\frac{|r_{1}| + |r_{2}|}{2}$ is rational and strictly positive for distinct $r_{1}, r_{2}$, hence $x$ is irrational. However, $x$ need not lie in $(r_{1}, r_{2})$ for all choices. For example, with $r_{1} = 0$ and $r_{2} = 1$,\n$$\nx = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2} > \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1,\n$$\nso $x \\notin (0, 1)$. Therefore D is not guaranteed.\n\nFor E: $x = \\sqrt{r_{1} r_{2}}$. If $r_{1} < 0 < r_{2}$, then $r_{1} r_{2} < 0$ and $x$ is not a real number, so it certainly is not in $(r_{1}, r_{2})$. Even when $r_{1} r_{2} \\geq 0$, $x$ may be rational (e.g., $r_{1} = 1$, $r_{2} = 4$ gives $x = 2$), so irrationality is not guaranteed.

Note that\n$$\n\\gcd(100n + 1,\\, n) = \\gcd(1,\\, n) = 1,\n$$\nso $r_{n}$ is in lowest terms. A rational number has a rational square root if and only if, in lowest terms, both numerator and denominator are perfect squares. Thus, for $c_{n}$ to be rational, we would need $n = m^{2}$ and $100n + 1 = k^{2}$, i.e.,\n$$\nk^{2} - 100 m^{2} = 1.\n$$\nHowever, since $100 = 10^{2}$ is a perfect square, the only integer solutions to $k^{2} - 100 m^{2} = 1$ are $m = 0$, $k = \\pm 1$, which do not apply for $n \\geq 1$.
