The system monitors a stream of network packets. An alert is triggered if a packet meets both of the following criteria:\n1. The packet originates from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\n2. The packet's payload contains a signature matching a known malware pattern.\n\nLet $U$ be the universal set of all network packets scanned by the system.\nLet $A$ be the subset of packets originating from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\nLet $B$ be the subset of packets whose payload contains a known malware signature.\n\nA packet is considered \"high-risk\" if it belongs to the set $A \\cap B$. All other packets are considered \"low-risk\". The set of all low-risk packets is therefore the complement of the high-risk set, $(A \\cap B)^c$.\n\nAn engineer is tasked with configuring a logging rule to record every packet that is classified as \"low-risk\". The engineer implements the following logic:\n\n\"A packet $x$ is logged as 'low-risk' if and only if the packet $x$ does not originate from an external, non-whitelisted IP address AND the packet $x$ does not contain a known malware signature.\"\n\nThis implementation is flawed because it fails to log certain categories of low-risk packets. Your task is to identify the precise set of packets that are genuinely low-risk but are *not* logged by the engineer's flawed rule.\n\nWhich of the following set-theoretic expressions correctly represents this group of unlogged low-risk packets?\n\nA. $A \\cap B$\n\nB. $(A \\cup B)^c$\n\nC. $A^c \\cap B^c$\n\nD. $(A \\cap B^c) \\cup (A^c \\cap B)$\n\nE. $A \\cup B$", "solution": "Let's analyze the problem by defining the sets based on the information provided.\nThe set of all packets is $U$.\nThe set of packets from external, non-whitelisted IPs is $A$.\nThe set of packets with a malware signature is $B$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the set of \"high-risk\" packets. A packet is high-risk if it satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the set of high-risk packets is the intersection of $A$ and $B$.\n$$S_{\\text{high-risk}} = A \\cap B$$\n\nNext, we identify the true set of \"low-risk\" packets. This set consists of all packets that are not high-risk. This is the complement of the high-risk set with respect to the universal set $U$.\n$$S_{\\text{low-risk, true}} = (A \\cap B)^c$$\nBy applying De Morgan's laws for sets, which states that $(X \\cap Y)^c = X^c \\cup Y^c$, we can rewrite the true set of low-risk packets as:\n$$S_{\\text{low-risk, true}} = A^c \\cup B^c$$\nIn words, a packet is truly low-risk if it is *not* from an external IP, *or* it does *not* contain a malware signature, or both.\n\nNow, let's analyze the set of packets that are logged as \"low-risk\" by the engineer's flawed rule. The rule is: \"A packet $x$ is logged as 'low-risk' if and only if the packet $x$ does not originate from an external, non-whitelisted IP address AND the packet $x$ does not contain a known malware signature.\"\nA packet $x$ not originating from an external IP means $x \\in A^c$.\nA packet $x$ not containing a malware signature means $x \\in B^c$.\nThe logical \"AND\" corresponds to the set intersection. So, the set of packets logged by the engineer is:\n$$S_{\\text{logged}} = A^c \\cap B^c$$\n\nThe problem asks for the set of packets that are genuinely low-risk but are *not* logged by the flawed rule. This corresponds to the set difference between the true low-risk set and the set of logged packets.\n$$\\text{Unlogged packets} = S_{\\text{low-risk, true}} \\setminus S_{\\text{logged}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we found:\n$$\\text{Unlogged packets} = (A^c \\cup B^c) \\setminus (A^c \\cap B^c)$$\nThe set difference $X \\setminus Y$ is the set of elements in $X$ but not in $Y$. The expression $(X \\cup Y) \\setminus (X \\cap Y)$ is the definition of the symmetric difference of sets $X$ and $Y$, often denoted $X \\Delta Y$.\nIn our case, the set of unlogged packets is the symmetric difference of $A^c$ and $B^c$.\n$$ \\text{Unlogged packets} = A^c \\Delta B^c = (A^c \\setminus B^c) \\cup (B^c \\setminus A^c) $$\nWe can simplify these terms using the identity $X \\setminus Y = X \\cap Y^c$.\nThe first term is $A^c \\setminus B^c = A^c \\cap (B^c)^c = A^c \\cap B$.\nThe second term is $B^c \\setminus A^c = B^c \\cap (A^c)^c = B^c \\cap A$.\nCombining these, the set of unlogged packets is:\n$$\\text{Unlogged packets} = (A^c \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap B^c)$$\nThis expression represents the set of packets that satisfy exactly one of the two conditions: either they are from an external source but have no malware signature ($A \\cap B^c$), or they are not from an external source but do contain a malware signature ($A^c \\cap B$). These are indeed low-risk packets (since they don't satisfy both high-risk conditions), but they are missed by the engineer's logic, which requires a packet to fail *both* conditions to be logged.\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA. $A \\cap B$: The high-risk packets. Incorrect.\nB. $(A \\cup B)^c$: By De Morgan's law, this is $A^c \\cap B^c$. This is the set that *is* logged. Incorrect.\nC. $A^c \\cap B^c$: This is the set that *is* logged.
