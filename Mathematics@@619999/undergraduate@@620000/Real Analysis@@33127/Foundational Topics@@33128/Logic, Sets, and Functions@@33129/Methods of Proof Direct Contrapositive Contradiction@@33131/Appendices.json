[@problem_id:1310652]", "problem": "A student of real analysis makes a bold claim: \"There exists a non-empty open interval of real numbers, $(a, b)$ with $ab$, which contains no rational numbers.\" We will investigate this claim by assuming it is true and following a logical argument to see where it leads. The argument proceeds in a series of steps.\n\n**Assumption:** There exists an interval $(a,b)$ with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $a  b$ such that there are no rational numbers $q$ satisfying $a  q  b$.\n\n**Step 1:** Define the length of the interval as $d = b-a$. Since $a  b$, we have $d  0$.\n\n**Step 2:** Invoke the Archimedean Property, which states that for any positive real number $d$, there exists a positive integer, let's call it $n$, such that $n \\cdot d  1$. Rearranging this gives $b-a  \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\n**Step 3:** Consider the set $K$ of all integers greater than the real number $na$. That is, $K = \\{k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid k  na\\}$. According to the properties of real and integer numbers, this set $K$ is non-empty and is bounded below.\n\n**Step 4:** By the Well-Ordering Principle, which states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element, and its extension to any non-empty set of integers that is bounded below, the set $K$ must have a unique least element. Let's call this integer $m$.\n\n**Step 5:** The definition of $m$ as the least integer in $K$ implies two conditions simultaneously:\n(i) $m  na$\n(ii) $m-1 \\le na$\n\nGiven these five steps, which of the following statements is a necessary logical consequence that reveals a contradiction with the initial assumption?\n\nA.

We will analyze the implications of Step 5.\n\nFrom Step 5(i), we have the inequality $m  na$. Since $n$ is a positive integer (from Step 2), we can divide by $n$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{n}  a\n$$\nThis tells us that the rational number $\\frac{m}{n}$ is strictly greater than the lower bound of the interval, $a$.\n\nNext, we use Step 5(ii), which states $m-1 \\le na$. We can rearrange this to find an upper bound for $m$:\n$$\nm \\le na + 1\n$$\nAgain, dividing by the positive integer $n$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{n} \\le a + \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nNow, we use the result from Step 2, which is $b-a  \\frac{1}{n}$. This can be rewritten as $b  a + \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nLet's combine our findings. We have established that $\\frac{m}{n} \\le a + \\frac{1}{n}$ and also that $a + \\frac{1}{n}  b$. Chaining these inequalities together, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{n} \\le a + \\frac{1}{n}  b\n$$\nThis chain of inequalities directly implies that $\\frac{m}{n}  b$.\n\nSo far, we have shown two things about the rational number $\\frac{m}{n}$:\n1. $\\frac{m}{n}  a$\n2. $\\frac{m}{n}  b$\n\nCombining these two results, we have $a  \\frac{m}{n}  b$. This means that the rational number $\\frac{m}{n}$ must lie inside the open interval $(a, b)$.\n\nThis conclusion, however, directly contradicts our initial assumption that the interval $(a, b)$ contains no rational numbers. The existence of the rational number $\\frac{m}{n}$ within the interval demonstrates that the assumption must be false. Therefore, the statement that captures this fatal conclusion for the initial claim is that $\\frac{m}{n}$ must be a rational number within $(a, b)$. This matches option C.\n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n- **A. The number $\\frac{m}{n}$ is a rational number that is guaranteed to be greater than $b$.** This is false. As we have just proven, $\\frac{m}{n}  b$.\n- **B. The number $\\frac{m-1}{n}$ is a rational number that must lie within the interval $(a, b)$.** This is false. From Step 5(ii), we have $m-1 \\le na$, which implies $\\frac{m-1}{n} \\le a$. A number less than or equal to $a$ cannot be in the open interval $(a,b)$.\n- **D. The integer $m$ cannot exist, which contradicts the Well-Ordering Principle in Step 4.** This is incorrect. The Well-Ordering Principle is a fundamental axiom about integers. It guarantees that such an integer $m$ *must* exist. The contradiction arises from the logical consequences of $m$'s existence, not from its non-existence. The logic is sound; it's the premise that is flawed.\n- **E. The integer $n$ from Step 2, used to construct the number $\\frac{m}{n}$, must be an irrational number.** This is absurd.

If it is known that $a_n \\le b_n$ for every natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then it must be that $A \\le B$.\"\n\nThe student attempts to prove this proposition using the method of proof by contradiction. Below is the student's written argument.\n\n**Student's Argument:**\n**Step 1:** We are given that the sequence $(a_n)$ converges to $A$, $(b_n)$ converges to $B$, and $a_n \\le b_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 2:** We want to prove $A \\le B$. For a proof by contradiction, we assume the negation of the conclusion. Thus, we assume $A  B$.\n\n**Step 3:** Based on our assumption, the quantity $A-B$ is a positive real number. Let us choose $\\epsilon = A - B$. So, we have $\\epsilon  0$.\n\n**Step 4:** By the formal definition of convergence, since $(a_n) \\to A$, for our chosen $\\epsilon$, there must exist some natural number $N_1$ such that for all $n  N_1$, the inequality $|a_n - A|  \\epsilon$ holds. This implies $A - \\epsilon  a_n  A + \\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 5:** Similarly, since $(b_n) \\to B$, for the same $\\epsilon$, there must exist some natural number $N_2$ such that for all $n  N_2$, the inequality $|b_n - B|  \\epsilon$ holds. This implies $B - \\epsilon  b_n  B + \\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 6:** Let $N = \\max(N_1, N_2)$. For any integer $n  N$, both conditions from the previous steps are true. From Step 4, we have $a_n  A - \\epsilon$. From Step 5, we have $b_n  B + \\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 7:** Now, we substitute our specific choice, $\\epsilon = A - B$, into the inequalities from Step 6.\nFor $a_n$, we get: $a_n  A - (A - B) = B$.\nFor $b_n$, we get: $b_n  B + (A - B) = A$.\n\n**Step 8:** For all $n  N$, we have shown that $a_n  B$ and $b_n  A$. This result, however, does not contradict the given premise that $a_n \\le b_n$. For instance, if $A=5$ and $B=2$, our result shows $a_n  2$ and $b_n  5$, which is perfectly compatible with $a_n \\le b_n$ (e.g., $a_n=3, b_n=4$). Therefore, this line of reasoning fails to produce a contradiction.

The argument demonstrates that the proposition is actually false.\n\nB. The assumption for contradiction in Step 2 is incorrect. The negation of $A \\le B$ is $A \\ge B$.\n\nC.

A standard proof by contradiction assumes $A  B$ and derives a violation of $a_{n} \\le b_{n}$ for all sufficiently large $n$.\n\nThe student’s Steps 1–5 are standard: convergence is used to obtain $N_{1},N_{2}$ so that for $n  N_{1}$, $|a_{n}-A|  \\epsilon$, and for $n  N_{2}$, $|b_{n}-B|  \\epsilon$. The inference in Step 6 that for $n  N=\\max\\{N_{1},N_{2}\\}$ we simultaneously have $A-\\epsilon  a_{n}  A+\\epsilon$ and $B-\\epsilon  b_{n}  B+\\epsilon$ is correct and a standard “eventually” argument (there is no requirement to argue for all $n$, only to find a contradiction with the universal condition $a_{n} \\le b_{n}$ by producing $n$ for which $a_{n}  b_{n}$).\n\nThe core issue arises in Steps 3 and 7. The student picks $\\epsilon = A-B$, which is positive under the assumption $AB$. Substituting this into the bounds yields, for $n  N$,\n$$\na_{n}  A - (A-B) = B, \\quad b_{n}  B + (A-B) = A.\n$$\nThese inequalities do not force $a_{n}  b_{n}$; they only place $a_{n}$ above $B$ and $b_{n}$ below $A$. This is compatible with $a_{n} \\le b_{n}$ and thus does not yield a contradiction. Hence, while the choice $\\epsilon = A-B$ is valid in the sense that it satisfies $\\epsilon  0$, it is not sharp enough to force the strict crossing needed for $a_{n}  b_{n}$.\n\nA correct contradiction proceeds by choosing a more strategic $\\epsilon$, for example\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{A-B}{2},\n$$\nwhich still satisfies $\\epsilon  0$.

Therefore the proof by contradiction is viable; only the choice of $\\epsilon$ in the student’s attempt prevented the contradiction.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because the proposition is true and the student’s failure does not disprove it.\n- B is false because the negation of $A \\le B$ is $A  B$, which the student correctly assumed.\n- C is false because the substitution in Step 7 is algebraically correct.\n- D is correct: the $\\epsilon$ chosen is valid but not suitable; a better choice (such as $\\epsilon = \\frac{A-B}{2}$) yields the contradiction.\n- E is false because focusing on $n  N$ is exactly how one uses convergence to contradict a universal bound eventually.\n\nThus the primary error is identified by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1310685"}, {"introduction": "Powerful mathematical results often arise from synthesizing several simpler concepts.

We are given that the sequence is monotonic (non-decreasing), so we only need to show that it is bounded. Specifically, we will show it is bounded above.\n\nFirst, let's prove that $L$ is an upper bound for the entire sequence $(p_n)$. We will argue by contradiction. Assume that $L$ is not an upper bound for $(p_n)$. This means there exists some term in the sequence, say $p_N$, such that $p_N  L$.\n\nLet $\\epsilon = p_N - L$. Since $p_N  L$, we have $\\epsilon  0$.\nAccording to the definition of the limit of the subsequence, since $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} p_{n_k} = L$, for this specific $\\epsilon$, there must exist a positive integer $K$ such that for all $k \\geq K$, we have $|p_{n_k} - L|  \\epsilon$.\nThis inequality can be written as $L - \\epsilon  p_{n_k}  L + \\epsilon$.\nSubstituting our choice of $\\epsilon = p_N - L$, the right-hand side of the inequality becomes $p_{n_k}  L + (p_N - L) = p_N$.\nSo, for all $k \\geq K$, we have $p_{n_k}  p_N$.\n\nThe indices of the subsequence, $n_k$, form a strictly increasing sequence of integers, so $n_k \\to \\infty$ as $k \\to \\infty$.
