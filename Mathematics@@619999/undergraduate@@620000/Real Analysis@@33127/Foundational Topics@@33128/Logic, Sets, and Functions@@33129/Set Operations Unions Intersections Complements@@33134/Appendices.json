A function is not monotonic if it has intervals of increase and intervals of decrease. For a differentiable function, this means its derivative must change sign.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A. $f(x) = x^5 - 5x^3$**\nThis function is a polynomial. All polynomials are differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{D}$. To check for monotonicity, we find its derivative:\n$$f'(x) = 5x^4 - 15x^2 = 5x^2(x^2 - 3)$$\nThe sign of the derivative determines the function's behavior.\nFor $x=1$, $f'(1) = 5(1)^2(1^2 - 3) = -10 < 0$, so the function is decreasing.\nFor $x=2$, $f'(2) = 5(2)^2(2^2 - 3) = 20 > 0$, so the function is increasing.\nSince the derivative changes sign, the function is not monotonic on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function A is an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**B. $f(x) = \\exp(-x^2)$**\nThis function is a composition of the exponential function and a polynomial, both of which are differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $f(x)$ is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, and $f \\in \\mathcal{D}$. We find the derivative using the chain rule:\n$$f'(x) = \\exp(-x^2) \\cdot (-2x) = -2x \\exp(-x^2)$$\nThe term $\\exp(-x^2)$ is always positive. The sign of $f'(x)$ is determined by the sign of $-2x$.\nFor $x < 0$ (e.g., $x=-1$), $f'(-1) = -2(-1)\\exp(-(-1)^2) = 2e^{-1} > 0$, so the function is increasing.\nFor $x > 0$ (e.g., $x=1$), $f'(1) = -2(1)\\exp(-(1)^2) = -2e^{-1} < 0$, so the function is decreasing.\nSince the derivative changes sign, the function is not monotonic on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function B is an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**C. $f(x) = x^3 + 6x + 1$**\nThis is a polynomial, so it is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$ ($f \\in \\mathcal{D}$). Its derivative is:\n$$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 6$$\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$ for any real number $x$, $3x^2 \\ge 0$. This implies $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 6 \\ge 6$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe derivative is always positive, so the function is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$. A strictly increasing function is monotonic, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}$. This means $f \\notin \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function C is not an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**D. $f(x) = |x^3|$**\nFor differentiability, we note that for $x \\neq 0$, the function is either $x^3$ or $-x^3$, which are differentiable. At $x=0$, we must check the definition of the derivative:\n$$ f'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|h^3|}{h} $$\nThe right-hand limit is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h^3}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} h^2 = 0$.\nThe left-hand limit is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{-h^3}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} -h^2 = 0$.\nSince the left and right-hand limits of the difference quotient are equal, the function is differentiable at $x=0$. Thus, $f$ is differentiable on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{D}$.\nFor monotonicity, consider the behavior of $f(x)$.\nFor $x > 0$, $f(x) = x^3$ is increasing.\nFor $x < 0$, $f(x) = -x^3$ is decreasing (e.g., $f(-2)=8$ and $f(-1)=1$).\nSince the function is decreasing on $(-\\infty, 0]$ and increasing on $[0, \\infty)$, it is not monotonic on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function D is an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**E. $f(x) = 2x + \\cos(x)$**\nThis function is a sum of two functions that are differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, so it is also differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$ ($f \\in \\mathcal{D}$). The derivative is:\n$$f'(x) = 2 - \\sin(x)$$\nThe sine function has a range of $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, the value of $f'(x)$ is always in the range $[2-1, 2-(-1)] = [1, 3]$.\nSince $f'(x) \\ge 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the derivative is always positive. The function is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$ and thus monotonic. So $f \\in \\mathcal{M}$, which means $f \\notin \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function E is not an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\nThe functions that satisfy both conditions are A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "1322830"}, {"introduction": "This final practice introduces a dynamic aspect of set theory by examining sequences of sets.
