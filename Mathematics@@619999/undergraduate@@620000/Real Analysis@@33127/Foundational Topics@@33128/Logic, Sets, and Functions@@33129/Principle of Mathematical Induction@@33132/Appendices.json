The recursive ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}=\\frac{(n+1)!/4^{n+1}}{n!/4^{n}}=\\frac{n+1}{4}.\n$$\nTherefore $a_{n}$ is strictly increasing for all $n$ with $\\dfrac{n+1}{4}1$, i.e., for all $n\\geq 4$.

The probe's central processing unit is composed of $n$ critical, independent modules. For the probe to remain operational, all $n$ modules must function correctly.

Both models are invalid as reliability cannot be calculated this way.", "solution": "The problem asks for the general relationship between the exact reliability, $R_{exact}$, and the approximate reliability from the Linear Failure Aggregation (LFA) model, $R_{LFA}$. We must first formulate mathematical expressions for both quantities based on the problem description.\n\nThe reliability of a single module is the probability that it does not fail. For the $k$-th module, this is $1 - p_k$. Since the modules are independent and all must function for the probe to be operational, the exact overall reliability $R_{exact}$ is the product of the individual reliabilities:\n$$R_{exact} = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 - p_k)$$\n\nThe LFA model approximates the total failure probability as the sum of individual failure probabilities, which is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k$. The reliability is 1 minus the failure probability, so under this model:\n$$R_{LFA} = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k$$\n\nTo determine the relationship between $R_{exact}$ and $R_{LFA}$, we need to compare these two expressions. Specifically, we want to determine the validity of an inequality between $\\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 - p_k)$ and $1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k$. We will use the principle of mathematical induction on the number of modules, $n$.\n\nLet $P(n)$ be the statement $\\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 - p_k) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k$.\n\n**Base Case:** For $n=1$, the statement is:\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{1} (1 - p_k) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{1} p_k $$\n$$ 1 - p_1 \\ge 1 - p_1 $$\nThis is true (the equality holds). So, the base case $P(1)$ is valid.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that $P(m)$ is true for some integer $m \\ge 1$. That is, assume:\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{m} (1 - p_k) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k $$\n\n**Inductive Step:** We must show that $P(m+1)$ is true, i.e., that $\\prod_{k=1}^{m+1} (1 - p_k) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k$.\n\nStarting with the left-hand side of the inequality for $P(m+1)$:\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{m+1} (1 - p_k) = \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{m} (1 - p_k) \\right) (1 - p_{m+1}) $$\n\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we know $\\prod_{k=1}^{m} (1 - p_k) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k$. Since $p_{m+1} \\in [0, 1]$, the term $(1 - p_{m+1})$ is non-negative. Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the inductive hypothesis inequality by $(1 - p_{m+1})$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{m} (1 - p_k) \\right) (1 - p_{m+1}) \\ge \\left( 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k \\right) (1 - p_{m+1}) $$\n\nNow, let's expand the right-hand side of this new inequality:\n$$ \\left( 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k \\right) (1 - p_{m+1}) = 1 - p_{m+1} - \\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k + p_{m+1}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k\\right) $$\nWe can group the terms to match the form of the target right-hand side, $1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k$:\n$$ 1 - \\left(p_{m+1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k\\right) + p_{m+1}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k\\right) = \\left(1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k\\right) + p_{m+1}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k\\right) $$\n\nWe need to compare this expression to $1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k$. The additional term is $p_{m+1}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k\\right)$.\nSince $p_k \\in [0, 1]$ for all $k$, we have $p_{m+1} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, their product is non-negative:\n$$ p_{m+1}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k\\right) \\ge 0 $$\n\nThis implies:\n$$ \\left(1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k\\right) + p_{m+1}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k\\right) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k $$\n\nCombining our chain of inequalities, we have shown:\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{m+1} (1 - p_k) \\ge \\left( 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m} p_k \\right) (1 - p_{m+1}) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k $$\nThus, $\\prod_{k=1}^{m+1} (1 - p_k) \\ge 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} p_k$. This completes the inductive step.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality $P(n)$ holds for all integers $n \\ge 1$.\nThis means that for any $n \\ge 1$ and any valid set of probabilities $\\{p_k\\}$, we have $R_{exact} \\ge R_{LFA}$.
