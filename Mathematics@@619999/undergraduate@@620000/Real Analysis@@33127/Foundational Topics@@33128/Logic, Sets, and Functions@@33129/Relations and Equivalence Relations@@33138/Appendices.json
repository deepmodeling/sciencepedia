For non-zero $P, Q$, $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Q \\Leftrightarrow \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = L$ for some $L \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. For the zero polynomial $Z$, $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Z \\Leftrightarrow P=Z$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the limit condition for non-zero polynomials. Let $P(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots$ and $Q(x) = b_m x^m + \\dots$ with $a_n, b_m \\neq 0$.\nThe limit $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ exists and is a non-zero real number if and only if the degrees are equal ($n=m$). In this case, the limit is $\\frac{a_n}{b_m} \\neq 0$.\nSo, for non-zero polynomials $P, Q$, the condition $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Q$ is equivalent to $\\deg(P) = \\deg(Q)$.\n\nNow we check the three properties for all polynomials in $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\n1.  **Reflexivity**:\n    - If $P$ is the zero polynomial $Z$, the definition states $Z \\mathcal{R}_3 Z$. So it holds.\n    - If $P$ is non-zero, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{P(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} 1 = 1$. Since $1$ is a non-zero real number, $P \\mathcal{R}_3 P$.\n    Thus, $\\mathcal{R}_3$ is reflexive.\n\n2.  **Symmetry**:\n    - If $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Q$, we check if $Q \\mathcal{R}_3 P$.\n    - Case 1: $P=Z$. Then $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Q$ implies $Q=Z$. The condition to check is $Z \\mathcal{R}_3 Z$, which is true.\n    - Case 2: $P, Q$ are non-zero. $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Q$ means $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = L \\ne 0$. Then $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{P(x)/Q(x)} = \\frac{1}{L}$. Since $L \\ne 0$, $1/L$ is also a non-zero real number. Thus $Q \\mathcal{R}_3 P$.\n    Thus, $\\mathcal{R}_3$ is symmetric.\n\n3.  **Transitivity**:\n    - We check if $(P \\mathcal{R}_3 Q \\text{ and } Q \\mathcal{R}_3 R) \\Rightarrow P \\mathcal{R}_3 R$.\n    - Case 1: $Q=Z$. If $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Z$, then $P=Z$. If $Z \\mathcal{R}_3 R$, then $R=Z$. We have $P=Z$ and $R=Z$. The condition to check is $P \\mathcal{R}_3 R$, which is $Z \\mathcal{R}_3 Z$, and this is true.\n    - Case 2: $P, Q, R$ are all non-zero. $P \\mathcal{R}_3 Q$ means $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = L_1 \\ne 0$. $Q \\mathcal{R}_3 R$ means $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{Q(x)}{R(x)} = L_2 \\ne 0$. Now consider the limit for $P$ and $R$:\n    $$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{R(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \\cdot \\frac{Q(x)}{R(x)} \\right) = \\left( \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{Q(x)}{R(x)} \\right) = L_1 L_2 $$\n    Since $L_1 \\ne 0$ and $L_2 \\ne 0$, their product $L_1 L_2 \\ne 0$. The limit is a non-zero real number, so $P \\mathcal{R}_3 R$.\n    Thus, $\\mathcal{R}_3$ is transitive.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{R}_3$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that $\\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\\mathcal{R}_3$ are equivalence relations, while $\\mathcal{R}_2$ is not.
