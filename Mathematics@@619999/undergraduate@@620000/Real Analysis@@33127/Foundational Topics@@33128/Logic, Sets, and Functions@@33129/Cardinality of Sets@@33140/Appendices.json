The enumeration proceeds by grouping pairs according to the value of their sum, $s = m+n$. Pairs are ordered first by increasing value of their sum $s$. Within each group of pairs having the same sum, the pairs are ordered by the increasing value of their first component, $m$.\n\nThis process defines a bijection $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$, where $f(k)$ is the $k$-th pair in this enumeration. For instance:\n- The group with sum $s=2$ contains only $(1, 1)$.\n- The group with sum $s=3$ contains $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$ in that order.\n- The group with sum $s=4$ contains $(1, 3)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(3, 1)$ in that order.\n\nThus, the sequence of pairs begins with $f(1) = (1, 1)$, $f(2) = (1, 2)$, $f(3) = (2, 1)$, $f(4) = (1, 3)$, $f(5) = (2, 2)$, and so on.\n\nYour task is to determine the specific ordered pair $(m, n)$ that corresponds to the 100th position in this enumeration.

Let's consider the point $x=1$, which is in the domain $S$. The function gives $f(1)=1$. However, the codomain is $T=[0,1)$, which does not include the value $1$. Therefore, this definition does not describe a function from $S$ to $T$.\n\nOption B: $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \\in [0,1) \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x = 1 \\end{cases}$.\nThis function maps every element of $S$ to an element in $T$. For $x \\in [0,1)$, $f(x)=x \\in [0,1) = T$. For $x=1$, $f(1)=0 \\in T$. So it is a valid function from $S$ to $T$.\nNow, let's check for injectivity.

Since $[0, 1/2]$ is a subset of $[0,1)$, this is a valid function from $S$ to $T$.\nLet's check for surjectivity. A function is surjective if every element in the codomain $T$ is the image of at least one element in the domain $S$. The range of this function is the set of all possible outputs, which is $[0, 1/2]$.\nConsider the element $y = 0.75$, which is in the codomain $T=[0,1)$. For $f$ to be surjective, there must be an $x \\in S$ such that $f(x) = 0.75$. This would mean $x/2 = 0.75$, which solves to $x=1.5$. However, $x=1.5$ is not in the domain $S=[0,1]$. Thus, there is no element in the domain that maps to $0.75$. The function is not surjective.

The output is $f(x)=1/(n+1)$. Since $n\\ge1$, we have $n+1 \\ge 2$, so $0 < 1/(n+1) \\le 1/2$. This output is in $T=[0,1)$.\nIf $x \\in S \\setminus A$, then $x \\in [0,1]$ but $x$ is not of the form $1/n$. This means $x \\in [0,1)$. For these values, $f(x)=x$, and since $x \\in [0,1)$, the output is in $T$.\nSo, the function correctly maps all elements of $S$ to elements of $T$.\n\nSecond, let's check for injectivity. Let $x_1, x_2 \\in S$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$.\nCase 1: $x_1, x_2 \\in A$. Then $x_1=1/n_1$ and $x_2=1/n_2$. $f(x_1)=1/(n_1+1)$ and $f(x_2)=1/(n_2+1)$. If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, then $1/(n_1+1)=1/(n_2+1)$, which implies $n_1=n_2$, so $x_1=x_2$.\nCase 2: $x_1, x_2 \\in S \\setminus A$. Then $f(x_1)=x_1$ and $f(x_2)=x_2$. If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, then $x_1=x_2$.\nCase 3: $x_1 \\in A$ and $x_2 \\in S \\setminus A$. Then $f(x_1)=1/(n_1+1)$ for some $n_1 \\ge 1$. This means $f(x_1)$ is in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. On the other hand, $f(x_2)=x_2$. Since $x_2 \\in S \\setminus A$, $x_2$ cannot be in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. Therefore, it is impossible for $f(x_1)$ to equal $f(x_2)$.\nIn all cases where $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. The function is injective.\n\nThird, let's check for surjectivity. Let $y \\in T=[0,1)$. We need to find an $x \\in S$ such that $f(x)=y$.\nCase 1: $y$ is in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. Then $y=1/k$ for some integer $k \\ge 2$. We can write $k=m+1$ where $m=k-1 \\ge 1$. To get the output $y=1/(m+1)$, we need to find an input $x$ that maps to it. The function rule states that for an input $x=1/m$, the output is $f(1/m)=1/(m+1)=y$. Since $m \\ge 1$, this $x=1/m$ is in the set $A$ and therefore in the domain $S$. So we have found a pre-image.\nCase 2: $y \\in [0,1)$ and $y$ is not in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. Let's try the pre-image $x=y$. Since $y \\in [0,1)$, $x=y$ is in the domain $S=[0,1]$. Does $x=y$ belong to the set $A=\\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\ldots\\}$? No, because $y$ is not of the form $1/k$ for $k \\ge 2$, and $y \\ne 1$. So $x=y$ is in $S \\setminus A$. According to the function definition for this case, $f(x)=x$. Thus, $f(y)=y$. We have found a pre-image.\nSince every element $y$ in the codomain $T$ has a pre-image in the domain $S$, the function is surjective.\n\nSince the function is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1285592"}, {"introduction": "We now move from constructing bijections to applying the rules of cardinal arithmetic to compare sets of different infinite sizes.

We can show that $\\mathcal{F}$ is countably infinite. Consider the function $g: \\mathcal{F} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$ defined by $g(S) = \\sum_{i \\in S} 2^{i-1}$. For any finite subset $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, this sum is finite and produces a unique non-negative integer (this is based on the binary representation of integers). For example, $g(\\emptyset) = 0$, $g(\\{1\\}) = 2^0 = 1$, $g(\\{3\\}) = 2^2 = 4$, and $g(\\{1, 3\\}) = 2^0 + 2^2 = 5$. This function is injective (one-to-one) because every non-negative integer has a unique binary expansion. Since there is an injection from $\\mathcal{F}$ into the set $\\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$, which is itself countably infinite, we have $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq |\\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}| = \\aleph_0$.

Therefore, $|\\mathcal{F}|$ must be at least $\\aleph_0$. Combining these, we conclude that $|\\mathcal{F}| = \\aleph_0$.\n\nNext, let's determine the cardinality of $\\mathcal{E}$, the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ that contain every even number.\nLet $E = \\{2, 4, 6, \\ldots\\}$ be the set of even natural numbers and $O = \\{1, 3, 5, \\ldots\\}$ be the set of odd natural numbers.

The elements of $E$ are fixed for every set in $\\mathcal{E}$, while the elements from $O$ can be chosen freely.\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the sets in $\\mathcal{E}$ and the subsets of $O$. Let $\\mathcal{P}(O)$ be the power set of $O$. We can define a bijection $\\phi: \\mathcal{P}(O) \\to \\mathcal{E}$ by $\\phi(O') = E \\cup O'$. Therefore, $|\\mathcal{E}| = |\\mathcal{P}(O)|$.\nThe set of odd numbers $O$ is countably infinite, so $|O| = \\aleph_0$. The cardinality of the power set of a set with cardinality $\\kappa$ is $2^\\kappa$. Thus, $|\\mathcal{E}| = |\\mathcal{P}(O)| = 2^{|O|} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. It is a fundamental result in set theory that the cardinality of the continuum (the real numbers) is $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.

For infinite cardinals, addition is defined such that if $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ are cardinal numbers and at least one is infinite, then $\\kappa + \\lambda = \\max(\\kappa, \\lambda)$.\nIn our case, we have $|\\mathcal{F}| = \\aleph_0$ and $|\\mathcal{E}| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\nWe know that $\\aleph_0 < \\mathfrak{c}$.\nSo, $|\\mathcal{F} \\cup \\mathcal{E}| = |\\mathcal{F}| + |\\mathcal{E}| - |\\mathcal{F} \\cap \\mathcal{E}|$. We can establish bounds.\nSince $\\mathcal{E}$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{F} \\cup \\mathcal{E}$, we must have $|\\mathcal{E}| \\le |\\mathcal{F} \\cup \\mathcal{E}|$. This gives us the lower bound: $\\mathfrak{c} \\le |\\mathcal{F} \\cup \\mathcal{E}|$.\nFor the upper bound, we know that $|\\mathcal{F} \\cup \\mathcal{E}| \\le |\\mathcal{F}| + |\\mathcal{E}|$.
