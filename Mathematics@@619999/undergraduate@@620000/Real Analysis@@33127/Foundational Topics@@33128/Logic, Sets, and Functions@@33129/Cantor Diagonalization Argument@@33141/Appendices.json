This exercise presents a plausible but flawed argument that attempts to prove the set of polynomials $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is uncountable. By identifying the subtle reason why the constructed \"diagonal\" object fails to be a polynomial, you will gain a sharper insight into the structural properties a set must have for the argument to apply [@problem_id:1285317].", "problem": "An argument is presented below that attempts to prove that the set of all polynomials with rational coefficients, denoted by $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, is uncountable.\n\n**The Argument:**\nAssume, for a contradiction, that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is countable. This means we can create an exhaustive list of all such polynomials: $P_0(x), P_1(x), P_2(x), \\ldots$.\n\nEach polynomial $P_n(x)$ can be written in the form $P_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{nk} x^k$, where $a_{nk}$ is the rational coefficient of the $x^k$ term in $P_n(x)$. For any given polynomial $P_n(x)$ (which must have a finite degree), only a finite number of its coefficients $a_{nk}$ are non-zero.\n\nWe now construct a new object, $D(x)$, using a diagonalization procedure. Let the coefficient of $x^k$ in $D(x)$, denoted $d_k$, be defined as $d_k = a_{kk} + 1$. This defines the object $D(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} d_k x^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (a_{kk} + 1) x^k$.\n\nSince each coefficient $a_{kk}$ is rational, each $d_k$ is also rational. The argument then claims that $D(x)$ must be a polynomial with rational coefficients.\nFor any integer $n \\ge 0$, the constructed object $D(x)$ differs from the polynomial $P_n(x)$ because its coefficient of $x^n$, which is $d_n = a_{nn} + 1$, is not equal to the coefficient of $x^n$ in $P_n(x)$, which is $a_{nn}$. Therefore, $D(x)$ cannot be in the list $P_0(x), P_1(x), P_2(x), \\ldots$.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction: We have constructed $D(x)$, supposedly a polynomial with rational coefficients, which is not in the supposedly complete list of all such polynomials. The argument concludes that the original assumption must be false, and the set $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ must be uncountable.\n\nWhich of the following statements identifies the fundamental flaw in this argument?\n\nA. The argument's premise, that an exhaustive list $P_0, P_1, P_2, \\ldots$ can be formed, is what the argument seeks to disprove. This makes the entire line of reasoning circular and therefore invalid.\n\nB. The constructed object $D(x)$ is not guaranteed to be a polynomial, because the construction provides no mechanism to ensure that it has only a finite number of non-zero coefficients.\n\nC. If for some polynomial $P_n(x)$ in the list, the diagonal coefficient $a_{nn}$ happens to be $-1$, then the new coefficient $d_n$ will be $0$. This fails to distinguish $D(x)$ from a polynomial in the list that also has a zero coefficient at that position.\n\nD. The argument must be flawed because it is a known theorem that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is countable. The argument attempts to prove a false conclusion, so its logic is irrelevant.\n\nE. The argument fails because $D(x)$ is only guaranteed to differ from $P_n(x)$ at the $n$-th coefficient. It is possible that $D(x)$ is identical to some other polynomial $P_m(x)$ in the list, where $m \\neq n$.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the relevant definitions and principles. A set is countable if its elements can be put in bijection with the natural numbers, which means we may list its elements as $P_{0}, P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots$. A polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is an expression of the form $P(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{N} a_{k} x^{k}$ with $N$ finite and each $a_{k} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. By contrast, a formal power series is an expression $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_{k} x^{k}$ that may have infinitely many nonzero coefficients.\n\nAssuming for contradiction that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is countable, the listing $P_{0}(x), P_{1}(x), \\ldots$ is a valid proof-by-contradiction setup. Each $P_{n}(x)$ has a coefficient sequence $(a_{n0}, a_{n1}, a_{n2}, \\ldots)$ in which all but finitely many entries are zero. The diagonal construction defines $d_{k}=a_{kk}+1$ and forms\n$$\nD(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} d_{k} x^{k}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (a_{kk}+1) x^{k}.\n$$\nSince each $a_{kk} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, we have $d_{k} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, but there is no guarantee that only finitely many $d_{k}$ are nonzero. In fact, the construction gives no mechanism ensuring $d_{k}=0$ for all sufficiently large $k$. Therefore $D(x)$ is, in general, merely a formal power series with rational coefficients, not necessarily a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nThe diagonal step does ensure that for each $n$, the $n$-th coefficient of $D(x)$, namely $d_{n}=a_{nn}+1$, differs from the $n$-th coefficient of $P_{n}(x)$, namely $a_{nn}$. Hence $D(x) \\neq P_{n}(x)$ for every $n$. However, this is irrelevant to the countability of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ unless $D(x)$ is itself an element of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, i.e., unless it is a polynomial with only finitely many nonzero coefficients. The fundamental flaw is the unjustified claim that $D(x)$ is a polynomial. Without that, the construction does not produce a counterexample to the assumed enumeration of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nAddressing the options:\n- A is incorrect because assuming an enumeration in a proof by contradiction is standard and not circular.\n- B correctly identifies that $D(x)$ need not be a polynomial, since the construction does not ensure finitely many nonzero coefficients.\n- C is incorrect because if $a_{nn}=-1$, then $d_{n}=0 \\neq a_{nn}$, so $D(x)$ still differs from $P_{n}(x)$ at index $n$.\n- D cites a true theorem but does not identify the logical flaw in the argument itself.\n- E is incorrect because the diagonal construction guarantees $D(x)$ differs from every $P_{n}(x)$ at least at the $n$-th coefficient, hence it cannot equal any $P_{m}(x)$ in the list.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental flaw is that the construction does not ensure $D(x)$ is a polynomial.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1285317"}]}
