The denominator $1+x^2$ is also continuous for all $x$ and is never zero. Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous everywhere, including on the interval $[1, \\infty)$.\n2.  **Positivity**: For $x \\ge 1$, $\\arctan x$ is in the interval $[\\pi/4, \\pi/2)$, so it is positive. The denominator $1+x^2$ is also always positive. Thus, $f(x)$ is positive for $x \\ge 1$.\n3.  **Decreasing**: To check if the function is decreasing, we examine its derivative, $f'(x)$. Using the quotient rule:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\arctan x}{1+x^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(\\arctan x) \\cdot (1+x^2) - \\arctan x \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(1+x^2)}{(1+x^2)^2}$$\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\cdot (1+x^2) - (\\arctan x) \\cdot (2x)}{(1+x^2)^2} = \\frac{1 - 2x \\arctan x}{(1+x^2)^2}$$\nFor $f(x)$ to be decreasing, we need $f'(x) < 0$. Since the denominator $(1+x^2)^2$ is always positive, this condition simplifies to $1 - 2x \\arctan x < 0$, or $1 < 2x \\arctan x$.\nFor $x \\ge 1$, we know that $\\arctan x \\ge \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\nTherefore, for $x \\ge 1$, the term $2x \\arctan x$ can be bounded:\n$$2x \\arctan x \\ge 2(1) \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\nSince $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we have $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx 1.57 > 1$.
