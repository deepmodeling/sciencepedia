The condition that $(b_{n})$ does not converge to zero is insufficient. One can have terms of $(b_{n})$ arbitrarily close to zero without the sequence converging to zero. For example, define $b_{n} = 1$ when $n$ is not a power of $2$, and $b_{2^{k}} = \\frac{1}{k}$. Then $(b_{n})$ does not converge to zero, yet it has a subsequence tending to zero.
