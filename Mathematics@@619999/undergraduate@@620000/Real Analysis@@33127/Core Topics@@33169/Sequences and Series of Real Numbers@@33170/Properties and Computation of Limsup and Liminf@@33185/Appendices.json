The presence of the term $(-1)^n$ suggests that the behavior of the sequence may differ for even and odd values of $n$. Therefore, we will analyze the subsequences corresponding to even and odd indices separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the subsequence of terms with even indices. Let $n=2k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. The subsequence is $(x_{2k})_{k=1}^{\\infty}$.\nThe terms of this subsequence are given by:\n$$x_{2k} = \\left(1 + \\frac{(-1)^{2k}}{2k}\\right)^{2k} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2k}\\right)^{2k}$$\nThis expression is in the form of the well-known limit definition of Euler's number, $e$. Specifically, we recall the fundamental limit:\n$$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m = e$$\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, the index $m=2k$ also goes to infinity. Thus, the limit of the even-indexed subsequence is:\n$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{2k} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2k}\\right)^{2k} = e$$\nSo, $e$ is a subsequential limit of $(x_n)$.\n\nNext, let's consider the subsequence of terms with odd indices. Let $n=2k-1$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. The subsequence is $(x_{2k-1})_{k=1}^{\\infty}$.\nThe terms of this subsequence are given by:\n$$x_{2k-1} = \\left(1 + \\frac{(-1)^{2k-1}}{2k-1}\\right)^{2k-1} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2k-1}\\right)^{2k-1}$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use another standard limit related to $e$. Let $m = 2k-1$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $m \\to \\infty$. The limit becomes:\n$$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m$$\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m = \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right)^m = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{m}{m-1}}\\right)^m = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{m-1+1}{m-1}\\right)^m} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m-1}\\right)^m}$$\nLet's analyze the denominator:\n$$\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m-1}\\right)^m = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m-1}\\right)^{m-1} \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m-1}\\right)^1$$\nAs $m \\to \\infty$, we have $m-1 \\to \\infty$. Let $j = m-1$. The limit of the first factor is $\\lim_{j \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{j}\\right)^j = e$. The limit of the second factor is $\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m-1}\\right) = 1+0=1$.\nTherefore, the limit of the denominator is $e \\cdot 1 = e$.\nSo, the limit of the odd-indexed subsequence is:\n$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{2k-1} = \\frac{1}{e} = \\exp(-1)$$\nThus, $\\exp(-1)$ is another subsequential limit of $(x_n)$.\n\nThe entire sequence $(x_n)$ is the union of the even-indexed subsequence $(x_{2k})$ and the odd-indexed subsequence $(x_{2k-1})$. These two subsequences cover all terms of $(x_n)$. Since they converge to different limits, the original sequence $(x_n)$ does not converge. Any convergent subsequence of $(x_n)$ must eventually be a subsequence of $(x_{2k})$ or $(x_{2k-1})$. Therefore, the set of all subsequential limits of $(x_n)$ is $S = \\{e, \\exp(-1)\\}$.\n\nThe limit superior is the supremum of the set of subsequential limits:\n$$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = \\sup S = \\sup\\{e, \\exp(-1)\\}$$\nSince $e \\approx 2.718$ and $\\exp(-1) \\approx 0.368$, we have $e > \\exp(-1)$. Thus, $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = e$.\n\nThe limit inferior is the infimum of the set of subsequential limits:\n$$\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = \\inf S = \\inf\\{e, \\exp(-1)\\} = \\exp(-1)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the limit superior and the limit inferior, respectively.
