This problem explores how a seemingly simple question about dividing a plane with lines generates a sequence defined by a recurrence relation.

Let $R_n$ denote the maximum number of non-overlapping regions the plane is divided into by exactly $n$ straight lines. This maximum number of regions is achieved when the lines are in \"general position,\" meaning that no two lines are parallel and no three or more lines intersect at the same point. For example, with $n=0$ lines, there is one region (the plane itself), so $R_0 = 1$. With $n=1$ line, there are two regions, so $R_1 = 2$. With $n=2$ non-parallel lines, there are four regions, so $R_2=4$.\n\nDetermine the closed-form expression for the term $R_n$ of this sequence, valid for any non-negative integer $n$.", "solution": "Let $R_n$ be the maximum number of non-overlapping regions a plane is divided into by $n$ lines in general position. We want to find a closed-form formula for $R_n$.\n\nFirst, let's establish a recurrence relation for $R_n$.\nConsider a plane already divided into $R_{n-1}$ regions by $n-1$ lines in general position. Now, we introduce the $n$-th line. To maximize the number of new regions, this new line must intersect as many of the existing regions as possible.\n\nThe condition of \"general position\" means the new $n$-th line is not parallel to any of the previous $n-1$ lines. Therefore, it will intersect all of them. Furthermore, since no three lines are concurrent, the $n$-th line will intersect the $n-1$ existing lines at $n-1$ distinct points.\n\nThese $n-1$ distinct intersection points on the new line divide it into $n$ segments. Specifically, there are two segments that extend to infinity (rays) and $n-2$ finite segments between the intersection points. Each of these $n$ segments of the new line passes through one of the existing $R_{n-1}$ regions. As a segment crosses a region, it partitions that region into two. Therefore, each of the $n$ segments on the new line creates one additional region.\n\nThis means that adding the $n$-th line increases the total number of regions by $n$. We can write this as a recurrence relation:\n$$R_n = R_{n-1} + n$$\nThis relation holds for $n \\ge 1$. We are given the base case $R_0 = 1$.\n\nNow, we solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for $R_n$. We can express $R_n$ by \"unrolling\" the recurrence:\n$$R_n = R_{n-1} + n$$\n$$R_n = (R_{n-2} + n-1) + n$$\n$$R_n = (R_{n-3} + n-2) + (n-1) + n$$\n$$...$$\n$$R_n = R_0 + 1 + 2 + \\dots + (n-1) + n$$\n\nWe can write this using summation notation:\n$$R_n = R_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k$$\n\nWe know the base case is $R_0 = 1$.

This is correct.\nFor $n=3$: $R_3 = \\frac{3^2 + 3 + 2}{2} = \\frac{9+3+2}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7$.\nGeometrically, for $n=3$, the third line intersects the first two at two distinct points, creating $3$ new regions.
