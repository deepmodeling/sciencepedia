Let's explore the interaction between subsequential limits and the operation of addition.\n\nFirst, we establish some definitions. A real number $L$ is called a **subsequential limit** of a sequence of real numbers $(a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ if there exists a subsequence $(a_{n_k})_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ that converges to $L$. We denote the set of all such subsequential limits for a sequence $(a_n)$ as $S_a$. For any two sets of real numbers $A$ and $B$, their **Minkowski sum** is the set $A+B$ defined as $A+B = \\{a+b \\mid a \\in A, b \\in B\\}$.\n\nConsider two arbitrary bounded sequences of real numbers, $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and $(y_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$. Let $S_x$ and $S_y$ be their respective sets of subsequential limits. Now, form a new sequence $(z_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ where $z_n = x_n + y_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $S_z$ be the set of subsequential limits of $(z_n)$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and general description of the relationship between the set $S_z$ and the Minkowski sum $S_x + S_y$?\n\nA. $S_z = S_x + S_y$ for any two bounded sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$.\n\nB. $S_x + S_y \\subseteq S_z$ for any two bounded sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$, and there exist sequences for which this inclusion is proper.\n\nC. $S_z \\subseteq S_x + S_y$ for any two bounded sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$, and there exist sequences for which this inclusion is proper.\n\nD.

Let $S_{x}$, $S_{y}$, and $S_{z}$ denote the sets of subsequential limits of $(x_{n})$, $(y_{n})$, and $(z_{n})$ respectively. Recall that $S_{x}+S_{y}=\\{a+b:a\\in S_{x},\\,b\\in S_{y}\\}$.\n\nWe first prove the inclusion $S_{z}\\subseteq S_{x}+S_{y}$. Let $L\\in S_{z}$. By definition, there exists a subsequence $(z_{n_{k}})_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ such that $z_{n_{k}}\\to L$. Since $(x_{n})$ is bounded, the subsequence $(x_{n_{k}})$ is bounded, so by the Bolzanoâ€“Weierstrass theorem there exists a subsubsequence $(x_{n_{k_{j}}})$ and a limit $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$ such that $x_{n_{k_{j}}}\\to a$. By definition of $S_{x}$, this means $a\\in S_{x}$. Along the same indices, we have $z_{n_{k_{j}}}\\to L$, hence\n$$\ny_{n_{k_{j}}}=z_{n_{k_{j}}}-x_{n_{k_{j}}}\\to L-a.\n$$\nTherefore $L-a\\in S_{y}$, since $(y_{n_{k_{j}}})$ is a subsequence of $(y_{n})$ converging to $L-a$. It follows that $L=a+(L-a)\\in S_{x}+S_{y}$. Since $L\\in S_{z}$ was arbitrary, we conclude\n$$\nS_{z}\\subseteq S_{x}+S_{y}.\n$$\n\nWe now show that the inclusion can be proper.

In particular, $S_{x}+S_{y}\\nsubseteq S_{z}$ in general, so equalities or the reverse inclusion fail in general.\n\nThus the most accurate and general description is that $S_{z}\\subseteq S_{x}+S_{y}$ always holds, and the inclusion can be proper.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1323578"}]}
