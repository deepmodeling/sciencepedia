The series in question is $S = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\n**Analysis of Statement A:**\nThis statement claims that the series converges because its terms $a_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ approach zero as $n \\to \\infty$. The condition $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n = 0$ is a necessary condition for a series $\\sum a_n$ to converge, but it is not sufficient. A well-known counterexample is the harmonic series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}$, which diverges even though its terms $\\frac{1}{n}$ go to zero. Therefore, this statement is based on faulty reasoning and is false.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B:**\nThe series $S$ is a series of positive terms, since $a_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}  0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. For such a series, the sequence of partial sums $S_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n$ is monotonically increasing. A monotonically increasing sequence converges if and only if it is bounded above. Therefore, the statement that the sequence of partial sums is bounded is equivalent to stating that the series $S$ converges. As we will show in the analysis of statement D, the series actually diverges. Thus, the sequence of partial sums is not bounded, and this statement is false.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C:**\nThis statement claims that the series satisfies the Cauchy criterion for convergence with $\\epsilon = 0.5$. The Cauchy criterion states that a series $\\sum a_n$ converges if and only if for every $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m  N$ and all integers $p \\ge 1$, the inequality $|\\sum_{k=m+1}^{m+p} a_k|  \\epsilon$ holds. Statement C is a specific instance of this criterion. If we can show that for $\\epsilon = 0.5$, no such $N$ exists, then this statement is false. The analysis of statement D will demonstrate exactly this.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D:**\nThis statement makes a claim about a specific block of terms in the series. Let's analyze the sum $T_n = \\sum_{k=n^2+1}^{(n+1)^2} a_k$.\nThe terms in the sum are $a_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$. So, $T_n = \\sum_{k=n^2+1}^{(n+1)^2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of terms in this sum. The upper index is $(n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1$ and the lower index is $n^2 + 1$. The number of terms is $((n^2 + 2n + 1) - (n^2 + 1)) + 1 = (2n) + 1 = 2n+1$.\n\nNext, let's find a lower bound for each term in the sum. The summation index $k$ varies from $n^2+1$ to $(n+1)^2$. For any $k$ in this range, we have $k \\le (n+1)^2$. Taking the square root gives $\\sqrt{k} \\le \\sqrt{(n+1)^2} = n+1$. Since the terms are positive, taking the reciprocal reverses the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\ge \\frac{1}{n+1} $$\nThis inequality holds for every term in the sum $T_n$.\n\nNow, we can find a lower bound for the entire sum $T_n$ by replacing each term with this minimum value.\n$$ T_n = \\sum_{k=n^2+1}^{(n+1)^2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} > \\sum_{k=n^2+1}^{(n+1)^2} \\frac{1}{n+1} $$\nNote the strict inequality because not all terms are equal to the lower bound (e.g., for $k  (n+1)^2$).\nThe sum on the right-hand side consists of $(2n+1)$ identical terms, each equal to $\\frac{1}{n+1}$.\n$$ T_n > (2n+1) \\times \\frac{1}{n+1} = \\frac{2n+1}{n+1} $$\nWe can simplify this lower bound:\n$$ \\frac{2n+1}{n+1} = \\frac{2(n+1) - 1}{n+1} = 2 - \\frac{1}{n+1} $$\nSo, we have established that $T_n > 2 - \\frac{1}{n+1}$.\n\nThe statement claims that $T_n > 1$ for any integer $n \\ge 1$. Let's check if our derived lower bound supports this.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we have $n+1 \\ge 2$.\nThis implies $0  \\frac{1}{n+1} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality: $-\\frac{1}{n+1} \\ge -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nAdding 2 to both sides gives: $2 - \\frac{1}{n+1} \\ge 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = 1.5$.\nSo, we have shown that for all $n \\ge 1$, $T_n > 2 - \\frac{1}{n+1} \\ge 1.5$.\nSince $1.5 > 1$, it is certainly true that $T_n > 1$ for all integers $n \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, statement D is true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStatement D being true has direct consequences for the other statements. It shows that for any $N$, we can find a block of terms after $N$ whose sum is greater than 1. (Specifically, choose any $n$ such that $n^2+1 > N$, then the sum $T_n$ is a block of terms with indices starting after $m=n^2 > N$, and their sum is greater than 1). This demonstrates that the Cauchy criterion fails for any $\\epsilon \\le 1$. This directly proves that statement C is false. Since the Cauchy criterion fails, the series diverges. This proves that statement B is false. As established initially, statement A is false.\nThus, the only true statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2320301"}, {"introduction": "The Cauchy criterion is not just an abstract test for convergence; it is the theoretical foundation for estimating errors when approximating infinite series with finite sums.
