Alex attempts a proof by contradiction. The formal definition of a sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ converging to a limit $L$ is: For every $\\epsilon  0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n  N$, the inequality $|a_n - L|  \\epsilon$ holds. The triangle inequality states that for any real numbers $x$ and $y$, $|x+y| \\le |x|+|y|$.\n\nHere are the steps of Alex's attempted proof:\n\n1.  **Assumption:** Suppose the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ converges to two distinct limits, $L_1$ and $L_2$, where $L_1 \\neq L_2$.\n2.  **Choice of $\\epsilon$**: Since $L_1 \\neq L_2$, let's define a positive number $\\epsilon = |L_1 - L_2|$.\n3.  **Applying the Definition of a Limit**:\n    *   Since $a_n \\to L_1$, there exists an integer $N_1$ such that for all $n  N_1$, we have $|a_n - L_1|  \\epsilon = |L_1 - L_2|$.\n    *   Since $a_n \\to L_2$, there exists an integer $N_2$ such that for all $n  N_2$, we have $|a_n - L_2|  \\epsilon = |L_1 - L_2|$.\n4.  **Combining Conditions**: Let $N = \\max(N_1, N_2)$. For any $n  N$, both inequalities from step 3 must hold true.\n5.  **Using the Triangle Inequality**: For any $n  N$, we can write:\n    $$|L_1 - L_2| = |(L_1 - a_n) + (a_n - L_2)| \\le |L_1 - a_n| + |a_n - L_2| = |a_n - L_1| + |a_n - L_2|$$\n6.  **Reaching a Conclusion**: Substituting the inequalities from step 3 into the result from step 5, we get:\n    $$|L_1 - L_2|  |L_1 - L_2| + |L_1 - L_2| = 2|L_1 - L_2|$$\n\nAlex concludes that since $|L_1 - L_2|  2|L_1 - L_2|$ is always true for $L_1 \\neq L_2$, the proof has succeeded. However, Alex's professor marks the proof as incorrect because it fails to establish a contradiction.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately identifies the fundamental flaw in Alex's reasoning?\n\nA. The choice of $N = \\max(N_1, N_2)$ is invalid, as it is not guaranteed that such an $N$ exists.\n\nB. The triangle inequality was used incorrectly in step 5; it should be $|L_1 - L_2| \\ge ||L_1 - a_n| - |a_n - L_2||$.\n\nC. The definition of a limit requires $|a_n - L| \\le \\epsilon$, not a strict inequality, which invalidates step 6.\n\nD. The final inequality $|L_1 - L_2|  2|L_1 - L_2|$ is a true statement for the assumed condition ($L_1 \\neq L_2$) and therefore does not represent a logical contradiction.\n\nE. The choice of $\\epsilon = |L_1 - L_2|$ is too large; the definition of a limit only guarantees convergence for arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$.", "solution": "The goal of a proof by contradiction is to start with an assumption (in this case, $L_1 \\neq L_2$) and derive a statement that is logically false, thereby proving the initial assumption must be false.\n\nLet's analyze Alex's argument step-by-step to find the flaw.\n\nSteps 1-5 are all logically and mathematically correct.\n1.  **Assumption:** This is the standard starting point for the proof by contradiction.\n2.  **Choice of $\\epsilon$**: If $L_1 \\neq L_2$, then $|L_1 - L_2|$ is a positive real number, so it is a valid choice for $\\epsilon$ according to the definition of a limit.\n3.  **Applying the Definition of a Limit**: This is a correct application of the formal definition of a limit for both $L_1$ and $L_2$ using the chosen $\\epsilon$.\n4.  **Combining Conditions**: Choosing $N = \\max(N_1, N_2)$ is the standard and correct way to ensure that both limit conditions hold simultaneously for all integers $n$ greater than $N$.\n5.  **Using the Triangle Inequality**: The manipulation $|L_1 - L_2| = |(L_1 - a_n) + (a_n - L_2)| \\le |a_n - L_1| + |a_n - L_2|$ is a correct application of the triangle inequality.\n\nThe error lies in the interpretation of the result in Step 6.\n6.  **Reaching a Conclusion**: Alex correctly derives the inequality $|L_1 - L_2|  2|L_1 - L_2|$. Let's examine this inequality. Let $x = |L_1 - L_2|$. By the initial assumption, $L_1 \\neq L_2$, which means $x  0$. The derived inequality is $x  2x$. This statement is true for any positive real number $x$.\n\nA contradiction is a statement that is inherently false, such as $x  x$ or $1 = 0$. Since Alex's final statement, $x  2x$ for $x0$, is a true statement, it does not contradict any known mathematical fact or axiom. Therefore, the argument, while consisting of valid steps, fails to achieve its purpose of reaching a contradiction. The premise $L_1 \\neq L_2$ has not been shown to lead to an absurdity.\n\nFor the proof to work, one must choose an $\\epsilon$ that leads to a false statement. The standard choice is $\\epsilon = \\frac{|L_1 - L_2|}{2}$. With this choice, the final step becomes:\n$$|L_1 - L_2| \\le |a_n - L_1| + |a_n - L_2|  \\epsilon + \\epsilon = 2\\epsilon$$\n$$|L_1 - L_2|  2 \\left( \\frac{|L_1 - L_2|}{2} \\right) = |L_1 - L_2|$$\nThis leads to the inequality $|L_1 - L_2|  |L_1 - L_2|$, which is a false statement for any real number and thus a valid contradiction. This shows that the initial assumption ($L_1 \\neq L_2$) must be false.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The set of natural numbers is well-ordered, so the maximum of any two natural numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$ always exists.\nB. This is incorrect. While the reverse triangle inequality is a valid theorem, the standard triangle inequality as used by Alex is also correct and is the appropriate one for this proof structure.\nC. This is incorrect. The standard modern definition of a limit uses a strict inequality, $|a_n - L|  \\epsilon$. Even if it were $\\le$, the argument's main flaw would persist.\nD. This is the correct analysis. The argument is logically sound but its conclusion is a true statement, not a contradiction. It proves nothing.\nE. This statement is misleading. While the choice of $\\epsilon$ is indeed the reason the proof fails, it is not because the definition \"only guarantees convergence for arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$\". The definition holds for *every* $\\epsilon  0$, large or small. The problem is that this specific choice of $\\epsilon$ is not \"small enough\" to force a contradiction from the logic.
