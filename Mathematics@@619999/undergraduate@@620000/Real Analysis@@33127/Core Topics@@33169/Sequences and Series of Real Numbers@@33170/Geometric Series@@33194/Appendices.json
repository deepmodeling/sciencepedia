These events are indexed by non-negative integers $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The amount of energy released during the $n$-th event, denoted as $E_n$, is determined by the ratio of two competing factors: a population inversion factor, $P_n = 2^{n+1}$, which enhances energy emission, and a thermal scattering factor, $S_n = 3^{n-1}$, which suppresses it. The energy released at stage $n$ is given by the formula $E_n = \\frac{P_n}{S_n}$.\n\nCalculate the total energy, $E_{total}$, released by this entire cascade process, which is the sum of energies from all events from $n=0$ to infinity.
