This theorem states:\nIf a series $\\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent, then every rearrangement of the series converges to the *same sum*.\n\nWe can state the contrapositive of this theorem, which is logically equivalent and equally valid:\nIf a convergent series $\\sum a_n$ has a rearrangement that converges to a different sum (or diverges), then the series $\\sum a_n$ is *not* absolutely convergent.\n\nLet's apply this to the information given in the problem.

This corresponds to the case where the original series $\\sum a_n$ is conditionally convergent.
