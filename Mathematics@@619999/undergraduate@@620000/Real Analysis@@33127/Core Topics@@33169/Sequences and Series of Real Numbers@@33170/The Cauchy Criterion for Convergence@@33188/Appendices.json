This practice focuses on a common and important type of sequence known as a contractive sequence, where the distance between consecutive terms shrinks by a consistent factor.

Such sequences, known as contractive sequences, are guaranteed to converge.\n\nTo demonstrate this using the Cauchy criterion, one typically establishes an upper bound for the term $|x_m - x_n|$ for any integers $m > n \\ge 0$. This bound can be expressed in a form that is independent of $m$. Following the standard procedure, which involves the triangle inequality and the summation of a geometric series, an inequality of the form $|x_m - x_n| \\le |x_1 - x_0| \\cdot f(a, n)$ can be derived.\n\nYour task is to find the specific expression for the function $f(a, n)$.
