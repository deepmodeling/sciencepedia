The index is $n$, and its cube root is $\\sqrt[3]{n}$. The product of these two is $n \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{n}$. The term $a_n$ is the reciprocal of this product.\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{n \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{n}}$$\n\nTo analyze the series, we need to simplify the expression for $a_n$.

The numerator is a difference of squares, or we can expand it directly:\n$(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n^2 + 2n + 1) - n^2 = 2n + 1$.\nSo, the general term is:\n$$a_n = \\frac{2n + 1}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}$$\nSince all terms $a_n$ are positive for $n \\ge 1$, we can use tests for series with positive terms, such as the Limit Comparison Test.\n\nTo use the Limit Comparison Test, we need to choose a suitable series $\\sum b_n$ for comparison. We can find an appropriate $b_n$ by examining the dominant behavior of $a_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nFor large $n$, the numerator $2n+1$ behaves like $2n$.\nThe term inside the square root in the denominator, $n^5+n$, behaves like $n^5$.\nTherefore, the denominator $\\sqrt{n^5+n}$ behaves like $\\sqrt{n^5} = n^{5/2}$.\nCombining these, $a_n$ behaves like $\\frac{2n}{n^{5/2}} = \\frac{2}{n^{3/2}}$.\n\nThis suggests we should compare our series with the p-series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$ where $b_n = \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}$.\nThe series $\\sum b_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}$ is a p-series with $p = 3/2$. Since $p = 3/2 > 1$, the series $\\sum b_n$ converges.\n\nNow, we apply the Limit Comparison Test by evaluating the limit $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n}$.\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{2n + 1}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}}{\\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(2n + 1)n^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $n$ in the expression, which is $n^{5/2}$.\nIn the numerator, we have $(2n+1)n^{3/2} = 2n^{5/2} + n^{3/2}$.\nIn the denominator, we can factor out $n^5$ from the square root: $\\sqrt{n^5 + n} = \\sqrt{n^5(1 + \\frac{n}{n^5})} = \\sqrt{n^5}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}} = n^{5/2}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}$.\n\nSo the limit becomes:\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n^{5/2} + n^{3/2}}{n^{5/2}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}}$$\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by $n^{5/2}$:\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{2n^{5/2}}{n^{5/2}} + \\frac{n^{3/2}}{n^{5/2}}}{\\frac{n^{5/2}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}}{n^{5/2}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2 + \\frac{1}{n}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}}$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, we have $\\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$ and $\\frac{1}{n^4} \\to 0$.\n$$L = \\frac{2 + 0}{\\sqrt{1 + 0}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$$\nThe Limit Comparison Test states that if $L$ is a finite positive number (i.e., $0  L  \\infty$), then both series $\\sum a_n$ and $\\sum b_n$ share the same convergence behavior.\nSince we found $L=2$, which is finite and positive, and we know that the comparison series $\\sum b_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}$ converges, we can conclude that the original series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(n+1)^2 - n^2}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}$ also converges.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA.

The form of the term $a_n$ is suggestive of the p-series, but the exponent is not constant. As $n \\to \\infty$, the exponent $1 + 1/n$ approaches $1$. This suggests that the series might behave similarly to the harmonic series, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$, where $b_n = \\frac{1}{n}$.

Both $a_n$ and $b_n$ are positive for all $n \\ge 1$. The Limit Comparison Test states that if the limit $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n}$ exists and is a finite positive number ($0  L  \\infty$), then both series $\\sum a_n$ and $\\sum b_n$ either converge or diverge together.\n\nLet's compute the limit $L$:\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{n^{1 + 1/n}}}{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n^{1 + 1/n}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n^1 \\cdot n^{1/n}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1/n}} $$\nNow, we need to evaluate the limit of the term $n^{1/n}$ as $n \\to \\infty$. This is an indeterminate form of the type $\\infty^0$. Let's analyze this limit separately. Let $y = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n}$. We can evaluate this by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(y) = \\ln\\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n}\\right) $$\nSince the natural logarithm is a continuous function, we can move the limit inside:\n$$ \\ln(y) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln(n^{1/n}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\ln(n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(n)}{n} $$\nThis limit is of the indeterminate form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$. We can apply L'Hôpital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and the denominator with respect to $n$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(n)}{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dn}(\\ln(n))}{\\frac{d}{dn}(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1/n}{1} = 0 $$\nSo, we have $\\ln(y) = 0$. To find $y$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ y = e^0 = 1 $$\nTherefore, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n} = 1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into our original limit $L$:\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1/n}} = \\frac{1}{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1 $$\nSince the limit $L=1$ is a finite positive number ($0  1  \\infty$), the Limit Comparison Test applies. This means that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1 + 1/n}}$ has the same convergence behavior as the harmonic series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nThe harmonic series is a p-series with $p=1$, and it is known to diverge. Consequently, the given series also diverges.\n\nSince all terms of the series are positive, the distinction between absolute and conditional convergence is not relevant; if the series were to converge, it would converge absolutely.
