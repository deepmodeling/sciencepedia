While sequences that grow infinitely large are clearly divergent, the behavior of divergent sequences can be much more nuanced. This first exercise explores a sequence that is unbounded, yet contains a subsequence that is perfectly stable, converging to zero. By analyzing its behavior for even and odd terms, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how a single sequence can embody two very different destinies.", "problem": "Consider the sequence $(a_n)$ defined for all positive integers $n$ by the formula:\n$$a_n = n(1 + (-1)^n)$$\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the long-term behavior of this sequence?\n\nA.

Therefore, the full sequence is unbounded and has a convergent subsequence. It does not converge to $0$ because the even subsequence diverges to $+\\infty$, and it is not bounded.

These sequences are bounded but fail to converge because they oscillate between multiple values, never settling on a single one.
