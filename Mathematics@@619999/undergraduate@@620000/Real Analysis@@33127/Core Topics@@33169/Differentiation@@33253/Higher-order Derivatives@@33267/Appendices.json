We will find this by successively differentiating the function four times using the product rule. The product rule for differentiation states that for two differentiable functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, the derivative of their product is given by $(u(x)v(x))' = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)$.\n\nFor our function $f(x) = x^2 e^x$, we can set $u(x) = x^2$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivatives are $u'(x) = 2x$ and $v'(x) = e^x$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the first derivative, $f'(x)$.**\nUsing the product rule:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 e^x) = (2x)(e^x) + (x^2)(e^x) = (x^2 + 2x)e^x$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the second derivative, $f''(x)$.**\nWe now differentiate $f'(x)$. Let $u(x) = x^2 + 2x$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivative of $u(x)$ is $u'(x) = 2x + 2$.\nApplying the product rule again:\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((x^2 + 2x)e^x) = (2x + 2)e^x + (x^2 + 2x)e^x$.\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$f''(x) = (x^2 + 2x + 2x + 2)e^x = (x^2 + 4x + 2)e^x$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the third derivative, $f'''(x)$.**\nWe differentiate $f''(x)$. Let $u(x) = x^2 + 4x + 2$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivative of $u(x)$ is $u'(x) = 2x + 4$.\nApplying the product rule:\n$f'''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((x^2 + 4x + 2)e^x) = (2x + 4)e^x + (x^2 + 4x + 2)e^x$.\nCombining the terms:\n$f'''(x) = (x^2 + 4x + 2x + 2 + 4)e^x = (x^2 + 6x + 6)e^x$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the fourth derivative, $f^{(4)}(x)$.**\nFinally, we differentiate $f'''(x)$. Let $u(x) = x^2 + 6x + 6$ and $v(x) = e^x$. The derivative of $u(x)$ is $u'(x) = 2x + 6$.\nApplying the product rule for the fourth time:\n$f^{(4)}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((x^2 + 6x + 6)e^x) = (2x + 6)e^x + (x^2 + 6x + 6)e^x$.\nCombining the terms:\n$f^{(4)}(x) = (x^2 + 6x + 2x + 6 + 6)e^x = (x^2 + 8x + 12)e^x$.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the fourth derivative at $x=0$.**\nNow that we have the expression for the fourth derivative, we substitute $x=0$ into the equation for $f^{(4)}(x)$:\n$f^{(4)}(0) = (0^2 + 8(0) + 12)e^0$.\nSince $e^0 = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$f^{(4)}(0) = (0 + 0 + 12)(1) = 12$.\n\nThus, the value of the fourth derivative of $f(x) = x^2 e^x$ at $x=0$ is 12.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1302232"}, {"introduction": "In many scientific and geometric contexts, relationships are not always expressed as explicit functions of the form $y=f(x)$.
