The core principle to solve this problem is the Intermediate Value Theorem for derivatives, also known as Darboux's Theorem.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function $\\Delta(x)$. We are given $\\Delta(x) = f'(x) - g'(x)$.\nThe function $g(x)$ is given as $g(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. Using the chain rule, we can find its derivative, $g'(x)$:\n$$g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(\\pi x)) = \\cos(\\pi x) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(\\pi x) = \\pi \\cos(\\pi x)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta(x)$, we get:\n$$\\Delta(x) = f'(x) - \\pi \\cos(\\pi x)$$\nDarboux's Theorem applies to the derivative of a single differentiable function. To use it, we can define an auxiliary function, let's call it $h(x)$, such that its derivative $h'(x)$ is equal to $\\Delta(x)$.\nLet's define $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$.\nSince $f(x)$ is differentiable on $[0, 1]$ (as given in the problem) and $g(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$ is differentiable for all real numbers (and thus on $[0, 1]$), the function $h(x)$ is also differentiable on $[0, 1]$ because it is the difference of two differentiable functions.\n\nThe derivative of $h(x)$ is:\n$$h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(x) - g(x)) = f'(x) - g'(x) = \\Delta(x)$$\nNow we can apply Darboux's Theorem to the function $h(x)$ and its derivative $h'(x)$. The theorem states that if a function is differentiable on a closed interval $[a, b]$, then its derivative takes on every value between its values at the endpoints, $h'(a)$ and $h'(b)$, on the open interval $(a, b)$.\n\nWe need to calculate the values of the derivative $h'(x) = \\Delta(x)$ at the endpoints of the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nAt $x=0$:\n$$\\Delta(0) = h'(0) = f'(0) - \\pi \\cos(\\pi \\cdot 0)$$\nWe are given $f'(0) = \\pi$.
