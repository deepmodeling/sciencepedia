Express your final answer as a rational number in the specified unit of Amperes per Volt (A/V).", "solution": "The problem asks for the value of the dynamic conductance, $\\frac{dI}{dV}$, when the voltage $V$ is $5$ Volts. We are given the function $V(I) = I^5 + 3I + 1$.\n\nThe quantity $\\frac{dI}{dV}$ is the derivative of the inverse function of $V(I)$. Let's denote the function as $V = f(I) = I^5 + 3I + 1$. The inverse function would be $I = f^{-1}(V)$. The problem requires us to calculate $(f^{-1})'(5)$.\n\nThe theorem for the derivative of an inverse function states that if $y = f(x)$ and $f'(x) \\neq 0$, then the derivative of the inverse function $x = f^{-1}(y)$ is given by:\n$$(f^{-1})'(y) = \\frac{1}{f'(x)}$$\nIn our notation, this is:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dV} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{dV}{dI}}$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of the current $I$ that corresponds to a voltage of $V=5$ V. We set $V(I) = 5$ and solve for $I$:\n$$I^5 + 3I + 1 = 5$$\n$$I^5 + 3I - 4 = 0$$\nBy inspection, we can test small integer values for $I$. For $I=1$:\n$$(1)^5 + 3(1) - 4 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0$$\nSo, $I=1$ Ampere is the current flowing through the component when the voltage is $5$ Volts. To confirm this is the only relevant solution, we can examine the derivative of $V(I)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the derivative of $V$ with respect to $I$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dI} = \\frac{d}{dI}(I^5 + 3I + 1) = 5I^4 + 3$$\nFor the domain $I \\ge 0$, the term $5I^4$ is always non-negative. Therefore, $\\frac{dV}{dI} = 5I^4 + 3 \\ge 3$. Since the derivative is strictly positive, the function $V(I)$ is strictly increasing for $I \\ge 0$. This means the function is one-to-one, and $I=1$ is the unique positive solution to $V(I)=5$.\n\nNow we can evaluate this derivative at the specific point $I=1$ A:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dI}\\bigg|_{I=1} = 5(1)^4 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8$$\nThe unit for this quantity is Volts per Ampere (V/A).\n\nFinally, we can find the dynamic conductance $\\frac{dI}{dV}$ at $V=5$ V using the inverse function rule. The point $V=5$ corresponds to $I=1$.\n$$\\frac{dI}{dV}\\bigg|_{V=5} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{dV}{dI}\\bigg|_{I=1}} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in Amperes per Volt (A/V), which is the unit of conductance.
