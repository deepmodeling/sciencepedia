The function must be continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$.\n2. The function must be differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$.\n3. The function values at the endpoints must be equal, i.e., $f(a) = f(b)$.\n\nHere, the interval is $[a, b] = [-1, 1]$. Let's check each condition systematically.\n\n**Condition 3: Check if $f(-1) = f(1)$**\n\nFirst, we evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\nFor $x = -1$, we use the definition $f(x) = x^2$ since $-1 \\in [-1, 0]$.\n$$ f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1 $$\nFor $x = 1$, we use the definition $f(x) = 2x^2 - x$ since $1 \\in (0, 1]$.\n$$ f(1) = 2(1)^2 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\nSince $f(-1) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1$, the condition $f(-1) = f(1)$ is satisfied. This means option C is incorrect.\n\n**Condition 1: Check for continuity on $[-1, 1]$**\n\nThe function is defined by two polynomial pieces, $x^2$ and $2x^2 - x$. Polynomials are continuous everywhere.\n- On the interval $[-1, 0)$, $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous.\n- On the interval $(0, 1]$, $f(x) = 2x^2 - x$ is continuous.\n\nThe only point where continuity might fail is at the transition point, $x=0$. For the function to be continuous at $x=0$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value must all be equal.\n- Function value at $x=0$: $f(0) = 0^2 = 0$.\n- Left-hand limit as $x \\to 0^-$:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} x^2 = 0 $$\n- Right-hand limit as $x \\to 0^+$:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} (2x^2 - x) = 2(0)^2 - 0 = 0 $$\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0) = 0$, the function is continuous at $x=0$.\nTherefore, the function $f(x)$ is continuous on the entire closed interval $[-1, 1]$. This means option B is incorrect.\n\n**Condition 2: Check for differentiability on $(-1, 1)$**\n\nWe find the derivative of each piece of the function.\n- For $x \\in (-1, 0)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$.\n- For $x \\in (0, 1)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2 - x) = 4x - 1$.\n\nThe function is differentiable on $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$. We must check for differentiability at the point $x=0$, which is inside the open interval $(-1, 1)$. A function is differentiable at a point if its left-hand derivative and right-hand derivative exist and are equal.\n- Left-hand derivative at $x=0$:\n$$ f'_{-}(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} (2x) = 0 $$\n- Right-hand derivative at $x=0$:\n$$ f'_{+}(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} (4x - 1) = -1 $$\nSince $f'_{-}(0) = 0$ and $f'_{+}(0) = -1$, the left-hand and right-hand derivatives are not equal. Thus, the function $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.\nBecause $x=0$ is within the open interval $(-1, 1)$, the function is not differentiable on $(-1, 1)$. This violates the second hypothesis of Rolle's theorem. Therefore, the theorem is not applicable. This confirms that option A is the correct reason.\n\n**Analysis of remaining options:**\n\n- **Option D**: \"The derivative $f'(x)$ is never zero at any point where it is defined within the interval $(-1, 1)$.\"\nLet's check if $f'(x)$ can be zero.\nFor $x \\in (-1, 0)$, $f'(x) = 2x = 0$ implies $x=0$, which is not in the open interval $(-1, 0)$.\nFor $x \\in (0, 1)$, $f'(x) = 4x - 1 = 0$ implies $x = 1/4$. The point $c = 1/4$ is in the interval $(0, 1)$, and hence in $(-1, 1)$.\nSo, there is a point $c=1/4$ in $(-1, 1)$ where the derivative is zero. This means statement D is false. This is a subtle point: even though the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem is satisfied (a point with zero derivative exists), the theorem itself cannot be applied because its premises are not met.\n\n- **Option E**: \"Rolle's theorem is, in fact, applicable, and the premise of the question is false.\"\nAs we have shown, the function is not differentiable on $(-1, 1)$, so one of the hypotheses of Rolle's theorem fails. Therefore, the theorem is not applicable, and this statement is false.\n\nThe correct reason why Rolle's theorem is not applicable is that the function is not differentiable on the open interval $(-1, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2314489"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's move from the necessary conditions to the geometric intuition behind the theorem. Rolle's Theorem can feel abstract, but it describes a very clear physical reality.

In this final practice [@problem_id:2314501], you will see how it can be used to prove that an equation has exactly one real solution. This classic application combines the Intermediate Value Theorem (to show a root exists) with Rolle's Theorem (to show there can't be more than one), demonstrating how calculus provides definitive answers to fundamental questions in algebra.", "problem": "Determine the exact number of distinct real solutions to the equation $2x^5 + 5x^3 + x - 8 = 0$.", "solution": "Let the function be $f(x) = 2x^5 + 5x^3 + x - 8$. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct real roots of the function $f(x)$. We will solve this problem in two parts: first, by showing the existence of at least one root, and second, by showing that there cannot be more than one root.\n\nPart 1: Existence of at least one real root.\nThe function $f(x)$ is a polynomial, which means it is continuous for all real numbers $x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. We can use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to check for the existence of a root. The IVT states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and $k$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in the interval $(a, b)$ such that $f(c)=k$. We can use this to find a root (where $k=0$) by finding an interval where the function changes sign.\n\nLet's evaluate the function at two simple points:\nFor $x=0$:\n$f(0) = 2(0)^5 + 5(0)^3 + (0) - 8 = -8$.\nFor $x=2$:\n$f(2) = 2(2)^5 + 5(2)^3 + (2) - 8 = 2(32) + 5(8) + 2 - 8 = 64 + 40 + 2 - 8 = 98$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -8 < 0$ and $f(2) = 98 > 0$, and $f(x)$ is continuous on the interval $[0, 2]$, the IVT guarantees that there must be at least one value $c$ in the open interval $(0, 2)$ such that $f(c) = 0$. Therefore, there is at least one real solution to the equation.\n\nPart 2: Uniqueness of the real root.\nTo show that there is at most one real root, we will use a proof by contradiction involving Rolle's Theorem. Rolle's Theorem states that if a function $g$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and $g(a) = g(b)$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $g'(c) = 0$.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $f(x)$ has at least two distinct real roots. Let these roots be $a$ and $b$, with $a < b$. By the definition of a root, we have $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 0$.\nSo, we have $f(a) = f(b) = 0$.\n\nThe function $f(x) = 2x^5 + 5x^3 + x - 8$ is a polynomial, so it is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$. All the conditions for Rolle's Theorem are satisfied for the function $f(x)$ on the interval $[a, b]$.\nTherefore, according to Rolle's Theorem, there must exist some number $c$ in the interval $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^5 + 5x^3 + x - 8)$\n$f'(x) = 10x^4 + 15x^2 + 1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the derivative $f'(x)$.\nThe term $10x^4$ is always non-negative for any real number $x$, i.e., $10x^4 \\ge 0$.\nThe term $15x^2$ is also always non-negative for any real number $x$, i.e., $15x^2 \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, the derivative is:\n$f'(x) = 10x^4 + 15x^2 + 1 \\ge 0 + 0 + 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, we find that $f'(x) \\ge 1$ for all real numbers $x$. This means that the derivative $f'(x)$ can never be equal to zero. This contradicts our conclusion from Rolle's Theorem which stated that there must be a point $c$ where $f'(c) = 0$.\nThe contradiction arose from our initial assumption that there are at least two distinct real roots. Therefore, this assumption must be false. This implies that the function $f(x)$ can have at most one real root.\n\nConclusion:\nFrom Part 1, we established that there is at least one real solution.\nFrom Part 2, we established that there is at most one real solution.\nCombining these two results, we conclude that there is exactly one real solution to the equation $2x^5 + 5x^3 + x - 8 = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2314501"}]}
