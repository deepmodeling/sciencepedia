This practice demonstrates how to use this connection to tackle a fundamental problem in mathematics: counting the number of real roots of an equation. By analyzing the derivative to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, you can map out its behavior and, in conjunction with the Intermediate Value Theorem, precisely determine how many solutions exist [@problem_id:2293099].", "problem": "Consider the polynomial function $p(x) = x^4 - 4x + 1$, where $x$ is a real variable.
