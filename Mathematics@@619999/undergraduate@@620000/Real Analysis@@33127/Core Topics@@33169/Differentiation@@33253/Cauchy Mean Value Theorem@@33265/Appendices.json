The derivation of this equation, as mentioned in the problem statement, is a clever application of Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem (CMVT), which we can outline first for a complete understanding before solving for $c$.\n\nLet's consider two functions, $f(t)$ and $g(t)$, on the interval $[0, x]$ for a fixed $x > 0$.
