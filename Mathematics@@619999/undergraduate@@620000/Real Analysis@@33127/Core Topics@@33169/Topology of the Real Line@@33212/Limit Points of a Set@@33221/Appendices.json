Indeed, if $x<1$, then $x$ has positive distance from $S_{2}$ and, since $a_{n}\\to 1$, the distances $\\left|x-a_{n}\\right|$ are bounded below by a positive number (the minimum over finitely many $n$ together with the limit inferior equal to $|1-x|>0$), so there exists $\\epsilon>0$ with $(x-\\epsilon,x+\\epsilon)\\cap S=\\varnothing$. A similar argument holds for $x>2$.
