We can factor the quadratic polynomial:\n$(x+3)(x-2) = 0$\nThe roots are $x_1 = -3$ and $x_2 = 2$.\n\nThe expression $p(x) = x^2 + x - 6$ represents an upward-opening parabola.

An interval is a set $I$ such that for any two points $a, b \\in I$ with $a<b$, any point $c$ with $a<c<b$ is also in $I$.\nThe set $S = (-\\infty, -3) \\cup (2, \\infty)$ is not an interval. For example, we can choose $a = -4 \\in S$ and $b = 3 \\in S$. The point $c=0$ satisfies $-4 < 0 < 3$, but $0 \\notin S$. Therefore, $S$ is not an interval, and thus it is not a connected set. Statement A is false.\n\nB. $S$ is a bounded set.\nA set is bounded if it is contained within some finite interval $[-M, M]$ for some $M > 0$. The set $S$ contains all numbers greater than 2, so it extends to $+\\infty$. It also contains all numbers less than -3, extending to $-\\infty$. For any chosen $M > 0$, the number $M+3$ is in $S$ and $|M+3| > M$. Thus, $S$ is unbounded. Statement B is false.\n\nC. $S$ is a closed set.\nA set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of $S$ is $S^c = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : x^2 + x - 6 \\le 0\\}$. This corresponds to the interval where the parabola is non-positive, which is between and including the roots. So, $S^c = [-3, 2]$.\nThe set $[-3, 2]$ is a closed interval, and thus a closed set. Since the complement of $S$ is closed, $S$ itself must be an open set. A non-empty proper subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ cannot be both open and closed. Therefore, $S$ is not a closed set. Statement C is false.\nAlternatively, a set is closed if it contains all its limit points. The point $x=2$ is a limit point of $S$ (for instance, the sequence $\\{2+1/n\\}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is in $S$ and converges to 2), but $2 \\notin S$. Hence, $S$ is not closed.\n\nD. $S$ is the union of two disjoint open rays.\nAn open ray is an interval of the form $(a, \\infty)$ or $(-\\infty, b)$. Our explicit form for $S$ is $(-\\infty, -3) \\cup (2, \\infty)$. This is indeed the union of two open rays: $(-\\infty, -3)$ and $(2, \\infty)$. These rays are disjoint because a number cannot be both less than -3 and greater than 2 simultaneously. Statement D is true.\n\nE. $S$ is a non-empty finite set.\nThe set $S$ is certainly non-empty (e.g., $10 \\in S$). However, it contains infinitely many points, for example, all integers greater than 2. Therefore, $S$ is an infinite set. Statement E is false.\n\nConclusion:\nThe only correct statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from direct inspection to a more powerful, abstract principle: the preservation of connectedness under continuous functions.
