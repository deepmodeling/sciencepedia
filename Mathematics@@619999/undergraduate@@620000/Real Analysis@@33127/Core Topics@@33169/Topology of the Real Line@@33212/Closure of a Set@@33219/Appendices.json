Let $x \\in (0,1)$ and let $\\epsilon>0$. Since $x \\in (0,1)$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $(x-\\delta,x+\\delta) \\subset (0,1)$. Taking $\\eta=\\min\\{\\epsilon,\\delta\\}$ ensures $(x-\\eta,x+\\eta) \\subset (0,1)$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, for any $a<b$ there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $a<q<b$. Applying this with $a=x-\\eta$ and $b=x+\\eta$ yields a rational $q$ with $x-\\eta<q<x+\\eta$.

This proves $(0,1) \\subset \\bar{S}$.\n\nNext, we show that $0 \\in \\bar{S}$ and $1 \\in \\bar{S}$. Let $\\epsilon>0$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $0<q<\\epsilon$. Then $q \\in S$ and $|q-0|<\\epsilon$, so every neighborhood of $0$ meets $S$, implying $0 \\in \\bar{S}$. Similarly, there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $1-\\epsilon<q<1$, so $q \\in S$ and $|q-1|<\\epsilon$, hence $1 \\in \\bar{S}$. Therefore $[0,1] \\subset \\bar{S}$.\n\nFinally, we show that no point outside $[0,1]$ lies in $\\bar{S}$. If $x<0$, set $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2}|x-0|$.
