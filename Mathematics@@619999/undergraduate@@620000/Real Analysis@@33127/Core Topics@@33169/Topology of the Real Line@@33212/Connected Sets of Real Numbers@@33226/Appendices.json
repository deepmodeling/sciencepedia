A connected component of a set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is a maximal connected subset of $A$. Consider the set $S$ defined by the following inequality:\n$$S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 9) < 0 \\}$$\nDetermine the total number of connected components of the set $S$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of connected components of the set $S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 9) < 0 \\}$. Since the connected subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ are intervals, we need to find the number of disjoint intervals whose union forms the set $S$.\n\nTo do this, we must solve the inequality $(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 9) < 0$. Let's define the polynomial $P(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 9)$. The first step is to find the roots of the equation $P(x) = 0$, as these are the points where the function can change its sign.\n\nThe roots are given by the solutions to the equations:\n1. $x^2 - 1 = 0 \\implies x^2 = 1 \\implies x = \\pm 1$\n2. $x^2 - 4 = 0 \\implies x^2 = 4 \\implies x = \\pm 2$\n3. $x^2 - 9 = 0 \\implies x^2 = 9 \\implies x = \\pm 3$\n\nThe roots of the polynomial $P(x)$, arranged in ascending order, are $-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3$. These roots divide the real number line into seven open intervals:\n$(-\\infty, -3)$, $(-3, -2)$, $(-2, -1)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(3, \\infty)$.\n\nThe sign of $P(x)$ is constant within each of these intervals. We can determine the sign of $P(x)$ in each interval by picking a test point.\n\nLet's start with the interval $(-1, 1)$ which contains $x=0$.\nAt $x=0$, $P(0) = (0^2 - 1)(0^2 - 4)(0^2 - 9) = (-1)(-4)(-9) = -36$.\nSince $P(0) < 0$, the inequality holds for the entire interval $(-1, 1)$. So, $(-1, 1)$ is one of the connected components.\n\nAll the roots of $P(x)$ have a multiplicity of one, which means the sign of $P(x)$ will change as we cross each root.\n- For the interval $(1, 2)$, which is to the right of the root $x=1$, the sign of $P(x)$ will be positive. $P(x) > 0$.\n- For the interval $(2, 3)$, crossing the root $x=2$, the sign flips again. $P(x) < 0$. So, $(2, 3)$ is another connected component.\n- For the interval $(3, \\infty)$, crossing the root $x=3$, the sign flips. $P(x) > 0$.\n\nNow let's examine the intervals to the left of $x=-1$.\n- For the interval $(-2, -1)$, which is to the left of the root $x=-1$, the sign of $P(x)$ will be positive (opposite to the sign in $(-1, 1)$). $P(x) > 0$.\n- For the interval $(-3, -2)$, crossing the root $x=-2$, the sign flips again. $P(x) < 0$. So, $(-3, -2)$ is the third connected component.\n- For the interval $(-\\infty, -3)$, crossing the root $x=-3$, the sign flips. $P(x) > 0$.\n\nSummarizing the sign analysis:\n- $P(x) > 0$ on $(-\\infty, -3) \\cup (-2, -1) \\cup (1, 2) \\cup (3, \\infty)$\n- $P(x) < 0$ on $(-3, -2) \\cup (-1, 1) \\cup (2, 3)$\n\nThe set $S$ is defined by the condition $P(x) < 0$. Therefore, $S$ is the union of the intervals where $P(x)$ is negative:\n$$S = (-3, -2) \\cup (-1, 1) \\cup (2, 3)$$\nThis expresses $S$ as the union of three disjoint open intervals. Each of these intervals is a connected set, and since they are disjoint, they are the connected components of $S$.

This exercise beautifully illustrates how fundamental topological properties govern the large-scale structure of subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$.", "problem": "Let $C$ be a non-empty compact subset of the real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $C$ has a finite number, $k$, of connected components, where $k$ is a positive integer. Let $C^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus C$ denote the complement of $C$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. The connected components of the set $C^c$ are open intervals. A connected component of $C^c$ is called *bounded* if it is a bounded set.

We are given that $C$ is a non-empty compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ with $k \\ge 1$ connected components. Let these components be $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k$.\n\nBy definition, connected components are disjoint. As subsets of $C$, each $C_i$ is bounded because $C$ is bounded (a property of compact sets in $\\mathbb{R}$). Furthermore, each $C_i$ is a closed set. This is because components of a compact set are not necessarily closed in the ambient space, but in a locally connected space like $\\mathbb{R}$, components of open and closed sets are open and closed respectively. More simply, as a maximal connected subset, if a limit point of $C_i$ were not in $C_i$, $C_i$ together with that limit point would form a larger connected set, contradicting maximality. Since $C$ is closed, any limit point of $C_i$ is also a limit point of $C$ and must be in $C$. If this limit point is not in $C_i$, it must be in some other component $C_j$. But components are disjoint and separated, so a limit point of $C_i$ cannot be in $C_j$. Thus, all limit points of $C_i$ are in $C_i$, making it a closed set.\n\nTherefore, each $C_i$ is a non-empty, compact (closed and bounded), and connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. The only such sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ are closed intervals of the form $[a, b]$ (where $a \\le b$, including the case $a=b$ for a single point).\n\nSo, we can write each component as $C_i = [a_i, b_i]$ for some real numbers $a_i \\le b_i$. Since the components are disjoint, we can order them along the real line. Let's label them such that their endpoints are ordered:\n$$a_1 \\le b_1 < a_2 \\le b_2 < \\cdots < a_k \\le b_k$$\nThe strict inequality $b_i < a_{i+1}$ comes from the fact that the components $C_i$ and $C_{i+1}$ are disjoint. The set $C$ is the union of these $k$ disjoint closed intervals:\n$$C = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} [a_i, b_i]$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the complement, $C^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus C$.\n$$C^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} [a_i, b_i] \\right)$$\nThis set is the union of all parts of the real line that are not in any of the intervals $[a_i, b_i]$. We can write this union explicitly:\n$$C^c = (-\\infty, a_1) \\cup (b_1, a_2) \\cup (b_2, a_3) \\cup \\cdots \\cup (b_{k-1}, a_k) \\cup (b_k, \\infty)$$\nThis expression is valid for $k > 1$. If $k=1$, $C=[a_1, b_1]$ and $C^c = (-\\infty, a_1) \\cup (b_1, \\infty)$.\n\nThe set $C$ is closed, so its complement $C^c$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$. A fundamental result in real analysis states that any non-empty open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ can be uniquely expressed as a countable union of disjoint open intervals. These disjoint open intervals are precisely the connected components of the open set.\n\nThe intervals in the union we wrote for $C^c$ are all open and disjoint. Therefore, they are the connected components of $C^c$. Let's list and classify them:\n1. The interval $(-\\infty, a_1)$ is a connected component. It is unbounded.\n2. The interval $(b_k, \\infty)$ is a connected component. It is also unbounded.\n3. The intervals of the form $(b_i, a_{i+1})$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k-1$ are connected components. Each of these is a bounded open interval.\n\nWe need to count the number of bounded components, which we denote by $m$. The bounded components are precisely the intervals $(b_i, a_{i+1})$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k-1$. The number of such intervals is $(k-1) - 1 + 1 = k-1$.\n\nSo, $m = k-1$.\n\nLet's check for the case $k=1$. In this case, $C=[a_1, b_1]$ and $C^c = (-\\infty, a_1) \\cup (b_1, \\infty)$. There are no intervals of the form $(b_i, a_{i+1})$. The number of bounded components is $m=0$. Our formula gives $m = k-1 = 1-1 = 0$, which is correct.\n\nFor any integer $k \\ge 1$, the number of connected components of $C$ is $k$, and the number of bounded connected components of its complement $C^c$ is $m=k-1$.
