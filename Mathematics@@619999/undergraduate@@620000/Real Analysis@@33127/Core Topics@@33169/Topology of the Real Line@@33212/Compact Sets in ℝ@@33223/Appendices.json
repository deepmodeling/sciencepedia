The inequality is $x^4 - 5x^2 + 4 \\le 0$. This is a quartic polynomial in $x$, but it can be treated as a quadratic in $x^2$. Let us make the substitution $y = x^2$. Since $x$ is a real number, we must have $y \\ge 0$. The inequality transforms into:\n$$y^2 - 5y + 4 \\le 0$$\nTo solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the corresponding equation $y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0$. We can factor the quadratic expression:\n$$(y - 1)(y - 4) = 0$$\nThe roots are $y=1$ and $y=4$. The parabola represented by the function $f(y) = y^2 - 5y + 4$ opens upwards. Therefore, the expression is less than or equal to zero for values of $y$ between and including the roots. This gives us the condition:\n$$1 \\le y \\le 4$$\nNow, we substitute back $y = x^2$:\n$$1 \\le x^2 \\le 4$$\nThis compound inequality can be split into two separate inequalities that must both be satisfied:\n1. $x^2 \\ge 1$\n2. $x^2 \\le 4$\n\nFor the first inequality, $x^2 \\ge 1$, taking the square root of both sides gives $|x| \\ge 1$. This is equivalent to $x \\le -1$ or $x \\ge 1$. So, the solution set for this part is $(-\\infty, -1] \\cup [1, \\infty)$.\n\nFor the second inequality, $x^2 \\le 4$, taking the square root of both sides gives $|x| \\le 2$. This is equivalent to $-2 \\le x \\le 2$. The solution set for this part is the closed interval $[-2, 2]$.\n\nThe set $S$ consists of all $x$ that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Thus, we need to find the intersection of the two solution sets:\n$$S = \\left( (-\\infty, -1] \\cup [1, \\infty) \\right) \\cap [-2, 2]$$\nThe intersection of $[-2, 2]$ with $(-\\infty, -1]$ is $[-2, -1]$.\nThe intersection of $[-2, 2]$ with $[1, \\infty)$ is $[1, 2]$.\nTherefore, the set $S$ is the union of these two intervals:\n$$S = [-2, -1] \\cup [1, 2]$$\nNow we analyze the topological properties of $S$.\n\nFirst, let's consider if $S$ is bounded. A set is bounded if it is contained within some interval of finite length. Our set $S$ is entirely contained within the interval $[-2, 2]$. More formally, for every $x \\in S$, we have $|x| \\le 2$. Thus, $S$ is a bounded set. This eliminates options B (\"not bounded\") and D (\"neither closed nor bounded\").\n\nNext, let's consider if $S$ is closed. A set is closed if it contains all of its limit points. The intervals $[-2, -1]$ and $[1, 2]$ are closed intervals, and are therefore closed sets in $\\mathbb{R}$. The finite union of closed sets is a closed set. Thus, $S = [-2, -1] \\cup [1, 2]$ is a closed set. This eliminates option C (\"not closed\") and D (\"neither closed nor bounded\").\n\nLet's consider if $S$ is open. A set is open if every point in the set is an interior point. The point $x=2$ is in $S$. However, any open interval centered at 2, say $(2-\\epsilon, 2+\\epsilon)$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, contains points greater than 2 which are not in $S$. Therefore, $x=2$ is not an interior point, and the set $S$ is not open. This eliminates option E.\n\nFinally, we consider if $S$ is compact. By the Heine-Borel theorem for subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$, a set is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded. We have established that $S$ is both closed and bounded. Therefore, $S$ is a compact set.
