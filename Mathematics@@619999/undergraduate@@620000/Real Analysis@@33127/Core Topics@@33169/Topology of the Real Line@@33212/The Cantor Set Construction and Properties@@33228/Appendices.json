The length of this interval is $1/3 - 0 = 1/3$. The open middle third has endpoints at $0 + (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9$ and $0 + (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9$.

The open middle third has endpoints at $2/3 + (1/3)(1/3) = 7/9$ and $2/3 + (2/3)(1/3) = 8/9$.

The Cantor set is defined as $\\mathcal{C} = \\bigcap_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n$. A point belongs to $\\mathcal{C}$ if and only if it belongs to $C_n$ for every integer $n \\ge 0$.\n\nThe construction starts with $C_0 = [0, 1]$. Clearly, $\\frac{1}{3} \\in C_0$.\n\nAt the first step, we remove the open interval $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})$ to get $C_1 = [0, \\frac{1}{3}] \\cup [\\frac{2}{3}, 1]$. The point $x=\\frac{1}{3}$ is an endpoint of the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{3}]$, so it is included in $C_1$.\n\nAt the second step, we remove the open middle thirds of the intervals in $C_1$. From the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{3}]$, we remove the open middle third, which is $(\\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{2}{9})$. From the interval $[\\frac{2}{3}, 1]$, we remove the open middle third, which is $(\\frac{7}{9}, \\frac{8}{9})$.

The point $x=\\frac{1}{3}$ is an endpoint of the interval $[\\frac{2}{9}, \\frac{1}{3}]$, so it is included in $C_2$.\n\nWe can observe a pattern. At each step $n$ of the construction, the point $x=\\frac{1}{3}$ is always an endpoint of one of the closed intervals that constitute the set $C_n$. Since we only remove *open* middle-third intervals, the endpoints of the construction intervals are never removed. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{3} \\in C_n$ for all $n \\ge 0$.

Since it has a representation ($0.0222..._3$) that uses only the digits 0 and 2, it is an element of the Cantor set.\n\nNow, let's determine if $x=\\frac{1}{3}$ is a boundary point of a removed interval. The open intervals removed during the construction are:\n- Step 1: $I_1 = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})$\n- Step 2: $I_{2,1} = (\\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{2}{9})$ and $I_{2,2} = (\\frac{7}{9}, \\frac{8}{9})$\n- and so on.\n\nThe boundary of the first removed interval, $I_1 = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})$, is the set of points $\\{\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\}$. The point $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ is indeed one of these boundary points.\n\nSo, we have established two facts:\n1.  The point $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ is an element of the Cantor set $\\mathcal{C}$.\n2.

It is both an element of the Cantor set and a boundary point.\n- E: False.
