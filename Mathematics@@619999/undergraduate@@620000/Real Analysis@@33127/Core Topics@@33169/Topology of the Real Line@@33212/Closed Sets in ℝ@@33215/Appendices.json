A set is not closed if we can find at least one limit point of the set that is not an element of the set itself.\n\nA. $S_1 = (-\\infty, 0] \\cup [1, \\infty)$.\nThis set is the union of two closed rays. The set $(-\\infty, 0]$ is closed because its complement in $\\mathbb{R}$, which is $(0, \\infty)$, is an open set. Similarly, $[1, \\infty)$ is closed because its complement, $(-\\infty, 1)$, is an open set. The finite union of closed sets is always a closed set. Therefore, $S_1$ is a closed set.\n\nB. $S_2 = \\left\\{ \\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\}$.\nLet's write out the first few elements of this set:\nFor $n=1, \\frac{(-1)^1}{1} = -1$.\nFor $n=2, \\frac{(-1)^2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor $n=3, \\frac{(-1)^3}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\nFor $n=4, \\frac{(-1)^4}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSo, $S_2 = \\left\\{-1, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\ldots\\right\\}$.\nConsider the sequence of points $x_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ from the set $S_2$. We can find the limit of this sequence as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n} = 0 $$\nSince the sequence of points from $S_2$ converges to 0, the point $p=0$ is a limit point of the set $S_2$. For $S_2$ to be a closed set, it must contain this limit point. However, is $0 \\in S_2$? This would require $\\frac{(-1)^n}{n} = 0$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, which is impossible. Therefore, $0$ is a limit point of $S_2$ but $0 \\notin S_2$. This means the set $S_2$ is not closed.\n\nC. $S_3 = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\sin(x) = 1\\}$.\nThe solutions to the equation $\\sin(x)=1$ are given by $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $S_3 = \\left\\{\\ldots, \\frac{\\pi}{2}-2\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi, \\ldots\\right\\}$.\nLet's consider two distinct points in this set, $x_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ and $x_j = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi$ with $k \\neq j$. The distance between them is $|x_k - x_j| = |2\\pi(k-j)| \\geq 2\\pi$. Since any two distinct points are separated by a distance of at least $2\\pi$, we can place an open interval of radius $\\pi$ around any point in $S_3$ that contains no other points from $S_3$. This means that $S_3$ has no limit points. A set that has no limit points is called a discrete set. The condition for a set to be closed is that it must contain all of its limit points. Since there are no limit points, this condition is vacuously satisfied. Thus, $S_3$ is a closed set.\n\nD. $S_4 = \\{0\\} \\cup \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\}$.\nThe elements of this set are $S_4 = \\left\\{0, 1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\ldots\\right\\}$.\nThe sequence of points $x_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ (for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$) are all in $S_4$. This sequence converges to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$. Thus, $0$ is a limit point of $S_4$.\nLet's check if there are other limit points. Any point $p \\neq 0$ cannot be a limit point. If $p \\in S_4$ and $p \\neq 0$, then $p = 1/k$ for some $k$. We can find an open interval around $p$ that contains no other points of $S_4$. If $p \\notin S_4$, we can also find an interval around $p$ that avoids all points of $S_4$. So, the only limit point of the set $\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\}$ is 0.\nThe set $S_4$ is defined to include this single limit point, 0. Since $S_4$ contains all of its limit points (namely, the point 0), it is a closed set.\n\nE. $S_5 = \\mathbb{Z}$, the set of all integers.\nLet $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a convergent sequence of points where each $x_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let the limit of this sequence be $L$. By the definition of convergence, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, we have $|x_n - x_m|  \\epsilon$. Let's choose $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then for $m, n > N$, we have $|x_n - x_m|  \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $x_n$ and $x_m$ are both integers, their difference must also be an integer. The only integer with an absolute value less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ is 0. So, $x_n - x_m = 0$, which means $x_n = x_m$ for all $m, n > N$. This shows that the sequence must be eventually constant. Let this constant value be $k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The limit of an eventually constant sequence is that constant value, so $L=k$. Since $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the limit $L$ is in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, any convergent sequence of integers converges to an integer. This means $\\mathbb{Z}$ contains all its limit points, and is therefore a closed set.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only set that does not contain all of its limit points is $S_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1287326"}, {"introduction": "In real analysis, the properties of 'closed' and 'bounded' are fundamental, and their interplay is central to the celebrated Heine-Borel theorem.
