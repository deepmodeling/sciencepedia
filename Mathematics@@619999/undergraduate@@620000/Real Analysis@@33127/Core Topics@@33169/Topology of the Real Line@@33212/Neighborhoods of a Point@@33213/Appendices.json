Express the final set using standard mathematical notation for sets of real numbers.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we first recall the definition of a neighborhood in the context of real analysis. A set $N \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is a neighborhood of a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ if there exists a real number $\\epsilon  0$ such that the open interval $(p - \\epsilon, p + \\epsilon)$ is a subset of $N$. That is, $(p - \\epsilon, p + \\epsilon) \\subseteq N$.\n\nThe given set is $S = (0, 5) \\setminus \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. We need to find all points $p$ for which such an $\\epsilon$ exists. We can analyze the problem by considering two disjoint cases for the point $p$: either $p$ belongs to $S$ or $p$ does not belong to $S$.\n\nCase 1: $p \\notin S$.\nA fundamental requirement for $S$ to be a neighborhood of $p$ is that the interval $(p - \\epsilon, p + \\epsilon)$ must be a subset of $S$. For any $\\epsilon  0$, the point $p$ itself is always an element of the interval $(p - \\epsilon, p + \\epsilon)$. If $p \\notin S$, it's impossible for an interval containing $p$ to be a subset of $S$. Therefore, $S$ cannot be a neighborhood of any point $p$ that is not in $S$.\nThe points not in $S$ are the numbers in the set $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus S = (-\\infty, 0] \\cup \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\cup [5, \\infty)$. Thus, for any $p$ in this set, $S$ is not a neighborhood of $p$.\n\nCase 2: $p \\in S$.\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary point $p$ such that $p \\in S$. By the definition of $S$, this means that $0  p  5$ and $p$ is not equal to any of the integers $1, 2, 3,$ or $4$. We need to determine if there exists an $\\epsilon  0$ such that $(p - \\epsilon, p + \\epsilon) \\subseteq S$.\nFor the interval $(p - \\epsilon, p + \\epsilon)$ to be a subset of $S$, it must be entirely contained within the interval $(0, 5)$ and must not contain any of the points $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nLet's find the distance from our point $p$ to the nearest point that is *not* in $S$. The points not in $S$ are the elements of the set $(-\\infty, 0] \\cup \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\cup [5, \\infty)$.\nThe distance from $p$ to the boundary point $0$ is $|p-0| = p$.\nThe distance from $p$ to the boundary point $5$ is $|5-p| = 5-p$ (since $p  5$).\nThe distances from $p$ to the excluded integer points are $|p-1|, |p-2|, |p-3|, |p-4|$.\nSince $p \\in S$, we know $p$ is not equal to $0, 5, 1, 2, 3,$ or $4$. Therefore, all of these distances are strictly positive numbers.\nLet's choose $\\epsilon$ to be the minimum of all these distances:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\min\\{p, 5-p, |p-1|, |p-2|, |p-3|, |p-4|\\} $$\nSince all the terms in the set are positive, their minimum, $\\epsilon$, is also positive.\n\nNow we must verify that the interval $(p-\\epsilon, p+\\epsilon)$ is indeed a subset of $S$.\nLet $x$ be any point in $(p-\\epsilon, p+\\epsilon)$. This means $|x-p|  \\epsilon$.\n1. We check if a point $x$ lies in $(0, 5)$.\nFrom the definition of $\\epsilon$, we have $\\epsilon \\le p$. This implies $p-\\epsilon \\ge p-p=0$. So, $x  p-\\epsilon \\ge 0$.\nAlso from the definition, we have $\\epsilon \\le 5-p$. This implies $p+\\epsilon \\le p+(5-p)=5$. So, $x  p+\\epsilon \\le 5$.\nThus, $0  x  5$, which means $x \\in (0, 5)$.\n\n2. We check if $x$ is one of the excluded integers $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nLet's check for $k=1$. From our choice of $\\epsilon$, we have $\\epsilon \\le |p-1|$. If $x$ were equal to 1, then we would have $|p-1| = |p-x|  \\epsilon$. This would mean $|p-1|  \\epsilon$, which contradicts $\\epsilon \\le |p-1|$. Thus, $x \\ne 1$. The same logic applies to $k=2, 3, 4$. For any $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we have $\\epsilon \\le |p-k|$, which prevents any $x$ in $(p-\\epsilon, p+\\epsilon)$ from being equal to $k$.\n\nSince any point $x \\in (p-\\epsilon, p+\\epsilon)$ satisfies both $x \\in (0, 5)$ and $x \\notin \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, it must be that $x \\in S$. Therefore, $(p-\\epsilon, p+\\epsilon) \\subseteq S$.\n\nThis shows that for any point $p \\in S$, we can find an $\\epsilon  0$ such that $S$ contains the $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of $p$. Thus, $S$ is a neighborhood for every one of its points.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the set of all points $p$ for which $S$ is a neighborhood is precisely the set $S$ itself.\nThe set $S = (0, 5) \\setminus \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ can be written as the union of the open intervals that are formed by removing the integer points from $(0, 5)$.\n$S = (0, 1) \\cup (1, 2) \\cup (2, 3) \\cup (3, 4) \\cup (4, 5)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(0, 1) \\cup (1, 2) \\cup (2, 3) \\cup (3, 4) \\cup (4, 5)}$$", "id": "1312009"}, {"introduction": "How does the property of being a neighborhood behave when we combine sets?
