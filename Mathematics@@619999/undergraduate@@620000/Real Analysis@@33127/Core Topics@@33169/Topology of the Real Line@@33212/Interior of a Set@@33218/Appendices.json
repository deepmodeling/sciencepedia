The closure of a set $S$ is the set $S$ together with all its limit points.\n\nA. $A = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers).\nLet's check the first condition, $\\text{Int}(A) = \\emptyset$.\nConsider any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. For any $\\epsilon  0$, the open interval $(k-\\epsilon, k+\\epsilon)$ contains real numbers that are not integers (e.g., $k+\\epsilon/2$). Therefore, no open interval is entirely contained within $\\mathbb{Z}$. This means $\\mathbb{Z}$ has no interior points, so $\\text{Int}(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\emptyset$. The first condition is satisfied.\nNow, let's check the second condition, $\\text{Int}(\\text{Cl}(A)) \\neq \\emptyset$.\nFirst, we find the closure of $A$. The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$. A set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.

So $x$ is a rational number in $[0, 4]$. For any $\\epsilon  0$, the open interval $(x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon)$ contains irrational numbers (due to the density of irrationals in the reals). Since these irrational numbers are not in $A$, no open interval can be fully contained in $A$. Therefore, $A$ has no interior points, and $\\text{Int}(A) = \\emptyset$. The first condition is satisfied.\nNow, let's check the second condition, $\\text{Int}(\\text{Cl}(A)) \\neq \\emptyset$.\nFirst, we find the closure of $A$. The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any real number $r$ and any $\\epsilon  0$, there is a rational number $q$ such that $|r-q|  \\epsilon$. The closure of the set of rational numbers within a closed interval $[a, b]$ is the interval $[a, b]$ itself.

The interior of the closed interval $[0, 4]$ is the open interval $(0, 4)$.\nThe set $(0, 4)$ is non-empty. So, the second condition is satisfied.\nSince both conditions are met, option C is a correct answer.\n\nD. $A = \\{1/n \\mid n \\text{ is a positive integer}\\} \\cup \\{0\\}$.\nLet's check the first condition, $\\text{Int}(A) = \\emptyset$.\nFor any point $x = 1/n$ in $A$ with $n \\ge 1$, we can choose $\\epsilon$ small enough, for example $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+1})$, such that the interval $(x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon)$ contains no other points of $A$. The point $x=0$ is also in A. For any $\\epsilon  0$, the interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ contains numbers not in $A$. Thus, no point in $A$ is an interior point. So, $\\text{Int}(A) = \\emptyset$. The first condition is satisfied.\nNow, let's check the second condition, $\\text{Int}(\\text{Cl}(A)) \\neq \\emptyset$.\nFirst, let's find the closure of $A$. The set $A$ is defined as the set of points $\\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots\\}$ plus its only limit point, $0$. A set that contains all its limit points is a closed set. Therefore, $A$ is a closed set.\nThe closure of a closed set is the set itself, so $\\text{Cl}(A) = A$.\nNow we find the interior of the closure: $\\text{Int}(\\text{Cl}(A)) = \\text{Int}(A)$.
