A set is bounded if it is contained within some ball of finite radius. For any point $(x,y) \\in A$, its coordinates are given by $x = \\cos^3(t)$ and $y = \\sin^3(t)$ for some $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.

The functions $\\cos(t)$, $\\sin(t)$, and the cubing function $u \\mapsto u^3$ are all continuous. The composition of continuous functions is continuous, so $f_1(t)$ and $f_2(t)$ are continuous.
