A point $x$ is a *limit point* of a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ if every open interval containing $x$ also contains a point of $S$ different from $x$. A point in a set that is not a limit point is called an *isolated point*. A set is *closed* if it contains all of its limit points.

Then either $x \\in P_{1}$ or $x \\in P_{2}$. Without loss of generality, assume $x \\in P_{1}$. Because $P_{1}$ is perfect, for every open interval $I$ containing $x$, there exists $y \\in P_{1}$ with $y \\neq x$ and $y \\in I$. Since $P_{1} \\subseteq P_{1} \\cup P_{2}$, this $y$ also lies in $P_{1} \\cup P_{2}$.

Although the intersection of closed sets is closed, the limit point property need not be preserved. Consider the counterexample $P_{1} = [0,1]$ and $P_{2} = [1,2]$.
