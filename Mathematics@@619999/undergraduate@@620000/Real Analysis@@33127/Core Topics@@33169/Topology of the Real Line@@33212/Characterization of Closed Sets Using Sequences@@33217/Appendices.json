A point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a limit point of a set $A$ if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, the open interval $(x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon)$ contains at least one point of $A$ different from $x$. A set $A$ is closed if it contains all of its limit points.

We show that $0$ is a limit point of $S_1$. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Choose $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $n > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.

Hence every open interval around $0$ contains a point of $S_1$ different from $0$, so $0$ is a limit point of $S_1$. Next, we show that $S_1$ has no other limit points. Let $x \\neq 0$. If $x \\notin S_1$, define $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\frac{1}{N} < \\frac{|x|}{2}$. For all $n \\geq N$, we have $|x - \\frac{1}{n}| \\geq |x| - \\frac{1}{n} > \\frac{|x|}{2}$.

For $k=1$, take $\\delta = \\frac{1}{4}$ since $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus every point of $S_1$ is isolated. Therefore the only limit point of $S_1$ is $0$. Since $0 \\notin S_1$, $S_1$ is not closed. Hence assertion I is false and assertion III is true.\n\nNow consider $S_2 = S_1 \\cup \\{0\\}$.

Next, we show that no $x \\neq 0$ is a limit point of $S_2$. If $x = \\frac{1}{k} \\in S_1$, the same isolation argument as above provides $\\delta > 0$ with $(x - \\delta, x + \\delta) \\cap S_2 = \\{x\\}$, so $x$ is not a limit point. If $x \\notin S_2$ and $x \\neq 0$, choose $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\frac{1}{N} < \\frac{|x|}{2}$. As before, for $n \\geq N$, $|x - \\frac{1}{n}| > \\frac{|x|}{2}$.

To check if $A$ is closed, we can consider its complement $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus A$. The complement is $(-\\infty, 1) \\cup (1, 2) \\cup (2, 3) \\cup \\dots$, which is a union of open intervals. The union of open sets is open, so $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus A$ is open. Therefore, its complement, $A$, is a closed set.\n\nThe set $B = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{-1, -1/2, -1/3, \\dots\\}$. To check if $B$ is closed, we can use the sequence criterion. A set is closed if and only if it contains the limit of every convergent sequence of its points. Let $(b_n)$ be a convergent sequence such that $b_n \\in B$ for all $n$. The points in $B \\setminus \\{0\\}$ are of the form $-1/m$. Any sequence of such points converges to $0$. For example, the sequence $(-1/n)$ converges to $0$. If a sequence $(b_n)$ in $B$ converges, its limit must be $0$, or it must be an eventually constant sequence, in which case its limit is one of the elements of $B$. Since $0 \\in B$, the set $B$ contains all of its limit points. Thus, $B$ is a closed set.\n\nNext, let's characterize the set product $S = A \\cdot B$.\nAn element $s \\in S$ is of the form $s = ab$ for some $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$.\nCase 1: $b = 0$. Then $s = a \\cdot 0 = 0$ for any $a \\in A$. So, $0 \\in S$.\nCase 2: $b = -1/m$ for some positive integer $m$. Then $s = a \\cdot (-1/m) = -a/m$ for some positive integer $a$.\nThe numbers of the form $-a/m$ where $a$ and $m$ are positive integers are precisely the negative rational numbers.\nCombining these cases, the set $S$ is the set of all non-positive rational numbers: $S = \\mathbb{Q}_{\\le 0}$.\n\nNow we determine if $S$ is closed.\nA set is closed if it contains all its limit points. We can test this using a sequence. Consider the number $-\\sqrt{2}$. This is a negative irrational number. We know that the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any real number, there exists a sequence of rational numbers that converges to it.\nTherefore, there exists a sequence of positive rational numbers, let's call it $(r_n)$, such that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} r_n = \\sqrt{2}$. For example, this could be the sequence of decimal approximations of $\\sqrt{2}$: $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \\dots$.\nEach term $r_n$ is a positive rational number, so we can write $r_n = a_n/m_n$ for positive integers $a_n$ and $m_n$.\nNow, let's construct a sequence $(s_n)$ by setting $s_n = -r_n = -a_n/m_n$.\nAccording to our characterization of $S$, each term $s_n$ is a negative rational number, so $s_n \\in S$ for all $n$.\nThe limit of this sequence is $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (-r_n) = - \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} r_n = -\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo we have found a sequence $(s_n)$ of points in $S$ that converges. For $S$ to be closed, its limit $L$ must also be in $S$. However, $L = -\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number. The set $S = \\mathbb{Q}_{\\le 0}$ contains only rational numbers. Therefore, $L \\notin S$.\nSince $S$ does not contain all of its limit points, $S$ is not a closed set.

Any open interval containing $0$, say $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ for $\\epsilon > 0$, contains positive numbers. For example, $\\epsilon/2$ is in this interval. However, $S = \\mathbb{Q}_{\\le 0}$ contains no positive numbers. So, the interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ is not a subset of $S$.\nAlternatively, let's choose a non-zero point in $S$, for instance $s=-1$. Consider any open interval containing $-1$, such as $(-1-\\epsilon, -1+\\epsilon)$. We know that between any two distinct real numbers, there is an irrational number. Thus, this interval contains infinitely many irrational numbers. Since $S$ contains only rational numbers, the interval is not a subset of $S$.\nSince we cannot find such an open interval for any point in $S$, the set $S$ is not open.
