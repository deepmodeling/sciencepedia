The second is the limit of the sequence of derivatives at $x=0$, denoted by $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f'_n(0)$. We will calculate each quantity separately.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $f'(0)$**\n\nFirst, we must find the pointwise limit function $f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x)$.\n$$ f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2}} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{1}{n^2}$ approaches $0$.
