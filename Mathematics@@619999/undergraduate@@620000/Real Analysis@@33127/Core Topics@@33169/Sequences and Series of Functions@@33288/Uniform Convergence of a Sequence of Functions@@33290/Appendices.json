Thus, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(0) = 0$.\nFor any $x > 0$, we can find the limit as $n \\to \\infty$ by dividing the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $n$, which is $n^2$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2nx}{1+n^2x^4} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{2x}{n}}{\\frac{1}{n^2}+x^4} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the numerator $\\frac{2x}{n}$ approaches $0$, and the denominator $\\frac{1}{n^2}+x^4$ approaches $x^4$. Since $x > 0$, $x^4 \\neq 0$.\nSo, for $x > 0$, we have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = \\frac{0}{x^4} = 0$.\nTherefore, the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ converges pointwise to the zero function, $f(x) = 0$, for all $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. This immediately shows that statement E is false.\n\nNext, we test for uniform convergence. A sequence of functions $\\{f_n\\}$ converges uniformly to a function $f$ on a set $S$ if and only if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} M_n = 0$, where $M_n = \\sup_{x \\in S} |f_n(x) - f(x)|$.\n\n**Analysis on $I_1 = [0, 1]$**\nWe consider $M_{n,1} = \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_n(x) - f(x)|$. Since $f(x)=0$ and $f_n(x) \\ge 0$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$, this simplifies to:\n$$ M_{n,1} = \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} \\frac{2nx}{1+n^2x^4} $$\nTo find the supremum, we use calculus to find the maximum value of $f_n(x)$ on $[0, 1]$ for a fixed $n$. Let's find the derivative of $f_n(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ f_n'(x) = \\frac{(2n)(1+n^2x^4) - (2nx)(4n^2x^3)}{(1+n^2x^4)^2} = \\frac{2n + 2n^3x^4 - 8n^3x^4}{(1+n^2x^4)^2} = \\frac{2n - 6n^3x^4}{(1+n^2x^4)^2} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find critical points:\n$$ 2n - 6n^3x^4 = 0 \\implies 6n^3x^4 = 2n \\implies x^4 = \\frac{2n}{6n^3} = \\frac{1}{3n^2} $$\nThe critical point is $x_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{3n^2}\\right)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{3^{1/4}\\sqrt{n}}$.\nFor any $n \\ge 1$, we have $0 < x_n \\le 1/3^{1/4} < 1$, so this critical point is in the interval $[0, 1]$.\nThe value of $f_n(x)$ at this critical point is:\n$$ f_n(x_n) = \\frac{2n\\left(\\frac{1}{3^{1/4}\\sqrt{n}}\\right)}{1+n^2\\left(\\frac{1}{3n^2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{n}}{3^{1/4}}}{1+\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{n}}{3^{1/4}}}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{n}}{4 \\cdot 3^{1/4}} = \\frac{3^{3/4}}{2}\\sqrt{n} $$\nThis value is the maximum of $f_n(x)$ on $[0, \\infty)$, and since $x_n \\in [0, 1]$, it is also the supremum on $[0, 1]$. So, $M_{n,1} = \\frac{3^{3/4}}{2}\\sqrt{n}$.\nNow we check the limit of $M_{n,1}$ as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} M_{n,1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{3^{3/4}}{2}\\sqrt{n} = \\infty $$\nSince this limit is not 0, the convergence is **not uniform** on $I_1 = [0, 1]$.\n\n**Analysis on $I_2 = [1, \\infty)$**\nWe consider $M_{n,2} = \\sup_{x \\in [1, \\infty)} |f_n(x) - f(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in [1, \\infty)} \\frac{2nx}{1+n^2x^4}$.\nFrom the previous analysis, we know that for any given $n \\ge 1$, the function $f_n(x)$ has a single maximum at $x_n = \\frac{1}{3^{1/4}\\sqrt{n}} < 1$. For $x > x_n$, the derivative $f_n'(x)$ is negative, which means $f_n(x)$ is a decreasing function.\nSince the interval $I_2 = [1, \\infty)$ lies entirely to the right of the maximum point $x_n$ (i.e., $x \\ge 1 > x_n$ for all $x \\in I_2$), the function $f_n(x)$ is strictly decreasing on $I_2$.\nTherefore, the supremum of $f_n(x)$ on $[1, \\infty)$ is attained at the leftmost point of the interval, which is $x=1$.\n$$ M_{n,2} = f_n(1) = \\frac{2n(1)}{1+n^2(1)^4} = \\frac{2n}{1+n^2} $$\nNow we check the limit of $M_{n,2}$ as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} M_{n,2} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n}{1+n^2} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{2}{n}}{\\frac{1}{n^2}+1} = \\frac{0}{0+1} = 0 $$\nSince this limit is 0, the convergence is **uniform** on $I_2 = [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ converges uniformly on $I_2 = [1, \\infty)$ but not on $I_1 = [0, 1]$.\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. $\\{f_n\\}$ converges uniformly on $I_1$, but not on $I_2$.
