Let's define the upper limit as $u(x) = \\sin(x)$ and the integrand as $f(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}$. The lower limit of integration is a constant, $a = 1/2$. The function $G(x)$ can be written as $G(x) = \\int_a^{u(x)} f(t) \\, dt$.\n\nTo find the derivative $G'(x)$, we apply the Chain Rule:\n$$G'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_a^{u(x)} f(t) \\, dt \\right) = f(u(x)) \\cdot u'(x)$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the upper limit, $u'(x)$:\n$$u'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(x)) = \\cos(x)$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the integrand $f(t)$ at the upper limit $u(x) = \\sin(x)$:\n$$f(u(x)) = f(\\sin(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\sin(x))^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(x)}}$$\n\nUsing the Pythagorean trigonometric identity, $\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$, we can simplify the denominator:\n$$1 - \\sin^2(x) = \\cos^2(x)$$\nTherefore,\n$$f(\\sin(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\cos^2(x)}}$$\n\nIt is crucial to be careful with the square root. The square root of a squared quantity is its absolute value: $\\sqrt{y^2} = |y|$. So, we have:\n$$f(\\sin(x)) = \\frac{1}{|\\cos(x)|}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the domain for $x$ is the interval $(0, \\pi)$. On this interval:\n- For $x \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $\\cos(x)$ is positive, so $|\\cos(x)| = \\cos(x)$.\n- For $x \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$, $\\cos(x)$ is negative, so $|\\cos(x)| = -\\cos(x)$.\n- At $x = \\pi/2$, $\\cos(x) = 0$, which makes the expression for $f(\\sin(x))$ undefined. This implies that $G(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=\\pi/2$.\n\nNow, we combine the parts to find $G'(x)$ using the formula $G'(x) = f(u(x)) \\cdot u'(x)$:\n$$G'(x) = \\frac{1}{|\\cos(x)|} \\cdot \\cos(x)$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$G'(x) = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{|\\cos(x)|}$$\n\nThis single expression is valid for all $x \\in (0, \\pi)$ except for $x=\\pi/2$, where the derivative does not exist.\nThe expression evaluates to:\n- $1$ for $x \\in (0, \\pi/2)$\n- $-1$ for $x \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$\n\nThis is the final simplified expression for the derivative.\n\nAlternatively, we could have first evaluated the integral. The antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}$ is $\\arcsin(t)$.\n$$G(x) = [\\arcsin(t)]_{1/2}^{\\sin(x)} = \\arcsin(\\sin(x)) - \\arcsin(1/2)$$\nThe function $\\arcsin(\\sin(x))$ is defined piece-wise on $(0, \\pi)$:\n$$\\arcsin(\\sin(x)) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \\in (0, \\pi/2] \\\\ \\pi - x & \\text{if } x \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi) \\end{cases}$$\nSo,\n$$G(x) = \\begin{cases} x - \\arcsin(1/2) & \\text{if } x \\in (0, \\pi/2] \\\\ \\pi - x - \\arcsin(1/2) & \\text{if } x \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi) \\end{cases}$$\nDifferentiating this piece-wise function gives:\n$$G'(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } x \\in (0, \\pi/2) \\\\ -1 & \\text{if } x \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi) \\end{cases}$$\nThis result is consistent with the expression $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{|\\cos(x)|}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\cos(x)}{|\\cos(x)|}}$$", "id": "1332130"}, {"introduction": "The power of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus rests on a critical condition: the continuity of the integrand.
