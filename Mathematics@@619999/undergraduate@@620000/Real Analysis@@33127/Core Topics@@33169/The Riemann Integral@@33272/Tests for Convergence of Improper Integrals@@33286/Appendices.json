A convenient splitting point is $x=1$:\n$$ I(p) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx + \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx $$\nLet's call these two integrals $I_1$ and $I_2$ respectively. We will analyze the convergence of each part separately using the Limit Comparison Test.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the convergence of $I_2 = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx$. The integrand is $f(x) = \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}$. As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\arctan(x)$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of $f(x)$ is similar to that of the function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{x^p}$. Let's formalize this with the Limit Comparison Test. We compute the limit of the ratio of the two functions:\n$$ L_2 = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}}{\\frac{1}{x^p}} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\arctan(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nSince the limit $L_2$ is a finite positive number ($0 < L_2 < \\infty$), the integral $I_2$ converges if and only if the integral $\\int_1^\\infty g(x) dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^p} dx$ converges. By the p-integral test, this integral converges if and only if $p > 1$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the convergence of $I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx$. The integral is improper near $x=0$. We again use the Limit Comparison Test. For small $x$, the Maclaurin series for $\\arctan(x)$ is $\\arctan(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\dots$, so $\\arctan(x)$ behaves like $x$ as $x \\to 0^+$. Let's compare the integrand $f(x) = \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}$ with the function $h(x) = \\frac{x}{x^p} = \\frac{1}{x^{p-1}}$. We compute the limit of their ratio as $x \\to 0^+$:\n$$ L_1 = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x)}{h(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}}{\\frac{x}{x^p}} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x} $$\nThis limit is an indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$, so we can apply L'HÃ´pital's Rule:\n$$ L_1 = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(\\arctan(x))}{\\frac{d}{dx}(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+x^2}}{1} = 1 $$\nSince the limit $L_1$ is a finite positive number ($0 < L_1 < \\infty$), the integral $I_1$ converges if and only if the integral $\\int_0^1 h(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{x^{p-1}} dx$ converges. By the p-integral test for integrals on $[0, 1]$, this integral converges if and only if the exponent is less than 1. That is, we must have $p-1 < 1$, which implies $p < 2$.\n\nFor the original integral $I(p)$ to converge, both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. We need $p > 1$ from the analysis at infinity, and $p < 2$ from the analysis near zero.\nCombining these two inequalities, we find that the integral converges for all $p$ such that $1 < p < 2$.\nThe set of all values of $p$ for which the integral converges is therefore the open interval $(1, 2)$.\nThe problem asks for the endpoints $a$ and $b$ of this interval $(a, b)$.\nThus, we have $a=1$ and $b=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$"}, {"introduction": "This next practice moves beyond direct computation to test your conceptual understanding of convergence.

For example, let $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^4}$.\nThe function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^4}$ is continuous and positive for $x \\geq 1$.\nThe integral $\\int_1^\\infty f(x) dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^4} dx$ is a p-integral with $p=4$. Since $p > 1$, this integral converges.\nNow, let's examine the integral of the square root of this function:\n$$ \\sqrt{f(x)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x^4}} = \\frac{1}{x^2} $$\nThe integral in question is $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$.\nThis is a p-integral with $p=2$. Since $p > 1$, this integral also converges.\nThis example demonstrates that it is possible for $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ to converge.

This function is positive and continuous for $x \\geq 1$.\nThe integral of this function is $\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x} dx$, which is a p-integral with $p=1$. This integral diverges.\nNow, if $\\sqrt{f(x)} = \\frac{1}{x}$, then we must have $f(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{x^2}$.\nLet's check if this choice of $f(x)$ satisfies the initial condition from the problem statement. The function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ is positive and continuous on $[1, \\infty)$. The integral is $\\int_1^\\infty f(x) dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$.\nThis is a p-integral with $p=2$. Since $p > 1$, this integral converges.\nSo, we have found a function, $f(x) = 1/x^2$, for which the premise ($\\int f(x) dx$ converges) is true, but the conclusion ($\\int \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ converges) is false.\nThis example demonstrates that it is possible for $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ to diverge. This eliminates option A (\"must converge\").\n\nConclusion:\nWe have found one case where $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ converges (when $f(x) = 1/x^4$) and another case where it diverges (when $f(x) = 1/x^2$). Both of these examples satisfy the condition that $\\int_1^\\infty f(x) dx$ converges. Therefore, the convergence of $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ is not predetermined; it depends on the specific function $f(x)$. This means that the integral may converge or may diverge.
