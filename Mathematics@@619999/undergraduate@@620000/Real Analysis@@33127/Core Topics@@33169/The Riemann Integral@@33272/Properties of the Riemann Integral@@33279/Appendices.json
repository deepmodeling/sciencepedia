For integrable functions $g(x)$ and $h(x)$:\n    $$\n    \\int_a^b (g(x) + h(x)) dx = \\int_a^b g(x) dx + \\int_a^b h(x) dx\n    $$\n    Applying this rule to our problem, we let $g(x) = c \\cdot f(x)$ and $h(x) = c$.\n    $$\n    \\int_a^b (c \\cdot f(x) + c) dx = \\int_a^b (c \\cdot f(x)) dx + \\int_a^b c \\ dx\n    $$\n\n2.  **Linearity of the Integral (Constant Multiple Rule):** A constant factor can be taken outside of the integral sign.\n    $$\n    \\int_a^b (k \\cdot g(x)) dx = k \\int_a^b g(x) dx\n    $$\n    Applying this to the first term of our expression from Step 1:\n    $$\n    \\int_a^b (c \\cdot f(x)) dx = c \\int_a^b f(x) dx\n    $$\n\n3.  **Substitution of Given Value:** We are given that $\\int_a^b f(x) dx = K$.
