A bounded function on a closed interval is Riemann integrable if its set of discontinuities has measure zero. A useful sufficient condition is that if the set of discontinuities is finite, the function is Riemann integrable.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThe function is defined as $f_n(x) = 1$ for $x \\in \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n\\}$ and $f_n(x) = 0$ otherwise.\n1.  **Riemann Integrability:** For any fixed integer $n$, the function $f_n(x)$ is non-zero only on the finite set of points $\\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n\\}$. The set of discontinuities of $f_n(x)$ is precisely this finite set. A function defined on a closed interval with a finite number of discontinuities is Riemann integrable. Thus, each $f_n(x)$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$.\n2.  **Pointwise Convergence:** We need to check the limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x)$ for any $x \\in [0,1]$.\n    - If $x$ is an irrational number, then $x$ is not in the enumeration of rationals $\\{r_1, r_2, \\dots\\}$. Thus, $f_n(x) = 0$ for all $n$. The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = 0 = D(x)$.\n    - If $x$ is a rational number, it must appear in the enumeration at some position, say $x = r_k$ for some integer $k$. For any $n \\geq k$, we have $x = r_k \\in \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n\\}$, which implies $f_n(x) = 1$. So, the sequence $(f_n(x))_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is eventually constant at 1. The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = 1 = D(x)$.\nSince both conditions are met, Option A is a correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe function is $f_n(x)=1$ if $x \\in S_n$ and $f_n(x)=0$ otherwise, where $S_n = \\{p/q \\in [0,1] \\mid p,q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 1 \\le q \\le n\\}$.\n1.  **Riemann Integrability:** For a fixed $n$, the set of denominators $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ is finite. For each denominator $q$ in this set, the number of possible numerators $p$ such that $0 \\le p/q \\le 1$ (i.e., $0 \\le p \\le q$) is also finite. So, the set $S_n$ is a finite union of finite sets, which makes $S_n$ itself finite. The function $f_n(x)$ is 1 on the finite set $S_n$ and 0 otherwise. Its set of discontinuities is $S_n$, which is finite. Therefore, $f_n(x)$ is Riemann integrable for each $n$.\n2.  **Pointwise Convergence:**\n    - If $x$ is irrational, it cannot be written as a fraction $p/q$.

In any subinterval of $[0,1]$, no matter how small, there are both rational and irrational numbers belonging to $U$. On this set $U$, $f_n(x) = D(x)$. The function $f_n(x)$ is therefore discontinuous at every irrational point and at every rational point not in $\\{r_1, \\dots, r_n\\}$. The set of discontinuities of $f_n(x)$ is the entire interval $[0,1]$. A function is Riemann integrable if and only if its set of discontinuities has Lebesgue measure zero. The set $[0,1]$ has measure 1. Thus, $f_n(x)$ is not Riemann integrable for any $n$.\nThe first condition is not satisfied.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThe function is $f_n(x) = (\\cos(\\pi x))^{2n}$.\n1.  **Riemann Integrability:** For any fixed $n$, the function $x \\mapsto \\pi x$ is continuous, $y \\mapsto \\cos(y)$ is continuous, and $z \\mapsto z^{2n}$ is continuous. The composition of continuous functions is continuous. Thus, $f_n(x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$. Every continuous function on a closed, bounded interval is Riemann integrable. So the first condition is satisfied.\n2.  **Pointwise Convergence:** Let's find the limit function $g(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x)$. The limit depends on the value of $|\\cos(\\pi x)|$.\n    - If $|\\cos(\\pi x)| = 1$, then $\\cos^2(\\pi x) = 1$. This occurs when $\\pi x = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. For $x \\in [0,1]$, this means $x=0$ or $x=1$. In this case, $f_n(x) = 1^{n} = 1$. So, $g(0) = 1$ and $g(1) = 1$.\n    - If $|\\cos(\\pi x)|  1$, then $\\cos^2(\\pi x) \\in [0, 1)$. This occurs for all $x \\in (0,1)$. For any value $c \\in [0,1)$, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} c^n = 0$. So, for $x \\in (0,1)$, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = 0$.\n    The limit function is $g(x) = 1$ if $x \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $g(x) = 0$ if $x \\in (0,1)$. This is not the Dirichlet function $D(x)$. For example, $D(1/2) = 1$, but $g(1/2) = 0$.\nThe second condition is not satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A and B satisfy both conditions. Options C and D each fail at least one condition.
