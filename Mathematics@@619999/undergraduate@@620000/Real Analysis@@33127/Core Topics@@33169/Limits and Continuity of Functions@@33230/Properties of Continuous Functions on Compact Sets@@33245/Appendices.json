Consequently, it is also continuous on the subset $K$.\n\nThe set $K$ is a classic example of a compact set in $\\mathbb{R}$. It is bounded, as all its elements lie within the interval $[0, 1]$. It is also closed, because the only limit point of the sequence $\\{1/n\\}$ is $0$, and $0$ is included in the set $K$. The Extreme Value Theorem states that any continuous function on a compact set must attain a maximum and a minimum value on that set. Therefore, we are guaranteed that a maximum and a minimum for $f(x)$ on $K$ exist.\n\nTo find these extrema, we can analyze the behavior of $f(x)$. A common technique is to use calculus. Let's consider the function $f(x)$ on the continuous interval $[0, 1]$, which is the smallest closed interval containing the set $K$. We find the critical points of $f(x)$ by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - x) = 2x - 1.$$\nSetting $f'(x) = 0$ gives $2x - 1 = 0$, which yields $x = 1/2$.\n\nThis critical point $x=1/2$ is an element of our set $K$, since for $n=2$, we have $1/n = 1/2$. The value of the function at this point is:\n$$f(1/2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}.$$\nThe second derivative is $f''(x) = 2 > 0$, confirming that $x=1/2$ is a local minimum.\n\nThe extrema of a continuous function on a closed interval can occur either at a critical point within the interval or at the boundaries of the interval. For the interval $[0, 1]$, the boundaries are $x=0$ and $x=1$. These two points are also members of the set $K$.\nLet's evaluate the function at these boundary points:\n$$f(0) = 0^2 - 0 = 0.$$\n$$f(1) = 1^2 - 1 = 0.$$\nThe values we have found are $f(1/2) = -1/4$, $f(0) = 0$, and $f(1) = 0$.\n\nNow we must confirm that these are indeed the extrema on the set $K$. The function $f(x) = x(x-1)$ is a parabola opening upwards. Its vertex (the global minimum) is at $x=1/2$. For $x \\in [0, 1]$, the function values are between $-1/4$ and $0$. Since our set $K$ is a subset of $[0, 1]$, all values $f(x)$ for $x \\in K$ must also lie in the range $[-1/4, 0]$.\nWe have found a point in $K$ where the function value is $-1/4$ (at $x=1/2$) and points where the value is $0$ (at $x=0$ and $x=1$).\nThus, the minimum value of $f(x)$ on $K$ is $-1/4$ and the maximum value is $0$.\n\nThe ordered pair (minimum value, maximum value) is $(-1/4, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(-\\frac{1}{4}, 0)}$$", "id": "1317577"}, {"introduction": "The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) is another fundamental tool for analyzing continuous functions, often used to prove the existence of solutions to equations.
