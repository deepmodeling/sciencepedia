The definition specifies $f(x)=\\sin(\\pi x)$ for $x\\in[-1,0]$, which includes $x=0$, and $f(x)=x^3-x$ for $x\\in(0,1]$, which excludes $x=0$.

On $[-1,0]$, $x\\mapsto\\sin(\\pi x)$ is continuous because the sine function and the map $x\\mapsto\\pi x$ are continuous. On $(0,1]$, $x\\mapsto x^3-x$ is a polynomial and hence continuous.

Since both one-sided limits equal $f(0)=0$, $f$ is continuous at $x=0$. Therefore, $f$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$.\n\nTo determine uniform continuity, we use the Heineâ€“Cantor theorem: a continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous. The interval $[-1,1]$ is compact in $\\mathbb{R}$, and we have shown $f$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$. Hence, $f$ is uniformly continuous on its domain.\n\nWe also note that $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$: the left derivative is\n$$\n\\lim_{h\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{\\sin(\\pi h)-\\sin(0)}{h}=\\pi\\cos(0)=\\pi,\n$$\nwhile the right derivative is\n$$\n\\lim_{h\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{(h^{3}-h)-0}{h}= \\lim_{h\\to 0^{+}}(h^{2}-1)=-1,\n$$\nso the one-sided derivatives are not equal.
