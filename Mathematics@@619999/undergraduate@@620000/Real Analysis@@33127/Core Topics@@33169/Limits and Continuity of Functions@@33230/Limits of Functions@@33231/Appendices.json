The definition of a limit, $\\lim_{x \\to k} f(x)$, concerns the values of $f(x)$ for $x$ close to $k$, but not for $x=k$ itself.\n\nLet's analyze the function $f(x)$ by considering two cases for the input $x$.\n\nCase 1: $x$ is an integer.\nIf $x$ is an integer, let $x = n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThen $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = \\lfloor n \\rfloor = n$.\nAnd $\\lfloor -x \\rfloor = \\lfloor -n \\rfloor = -n$.\nSo, $f(x) = n + (-n) = 0$.\nThus, $f(x) = 0$ for all integer values of $x$.\n\nCase 2: $x$ is not an integer.\nIf $x$ is not an integer, we can write $x = n + \\delta$ where $n$ is an integer and $0 < \\delta < 1$.\nThen $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = \\lfloor n + \\delta \\rfloor = n$.\nFor the second term, we have $-x = -n - \\delta$. Since $0 < \\delta < 1$, we have $-1 < -\\delta < 0$.\nSo, $-n - 1 < -n - \\delta < -n$.\nThis means $\\lfloor -x \\rfloor = \\lfloor -n - \\delta \\rfloor = -n - 1$.\nTherefore, for any non-integer $x$,\n$f(x) = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor -x \\rfloor = n + (-n - 1) = -1$.\nThus, $f(x) = -1$ for all non-integer values of $x$.\n\nNow, we want to find the limit $L = \\lim_{x \\to k} f(x)$ where $k$ is an integer. The limit is determined by the values of $f(x)$ in a deleted neighborhood of $k$, i.e., for $x$ in an open interval $(k-\\epsilon, k+\\epsilon)$ with $x \\neq k$, for some small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nFor any $x$ in such a deleted neighborhood of $k$, $x$ is not an integer. Based on our analysis in Case 2, for any non-integer value of $x$, the function $f(x)$ is equal to $-1$.\nSo, for all $x$ in the deleted neighborhood of $k$, we have $f(x) = -1$.\n\nThe limit of a constant function is the constant itself. Therefore, as $x$ approaches $k$ (without being equal to $k$), the value of $f(x)$ is consistently $-1$.\n$$L = \\lim_{x \\to k} f(x) = -1$$\n\nNote that the value of the function at $x=k$ is $f(k) = \\lfloor k \\rfloor + \\lfloor -k \\rfloor = k - k = 0$. However, the existence and value of the limit do not depend on the value of the function at the point itself. Since the function is equal to $-1$ for all points in any deleted neighborhood of $k$, the limit is $-1$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA. $L=0$ is incorrect.
