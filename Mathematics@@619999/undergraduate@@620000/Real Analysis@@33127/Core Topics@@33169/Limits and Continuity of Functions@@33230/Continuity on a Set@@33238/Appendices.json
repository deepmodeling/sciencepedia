We will use the sequential criterion for continuity provided in the problem statement. This analysis relies on the fact that both the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the set of irrational numbers, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$, are dense in the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any real number $c$, there exists a sequence of rational numbers that converges to $c$, and there also exists a sequence of irrational numbers that converges to $c$.\n\n**Analysis of Function A:**\n$f_A(x) = \\begin{cases} x  \\text{if } x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x \\notin \\mathbb{Q} \\end{cases}$\n\n*   **Continuity at $x=0$**: First, we evaluate the function at $x=0$. Since $0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, $f_A(0) = 0$. Let $(x_n)$ be any sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $x_n \\to 0$. We want to show that $f_A(x_n) \\to f_A(0) = 0$.\n    For any term $x_n$ in the sequence, either $x_n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ or $x_n \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    If $x_n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then $f_A(x_n) = x_n$.\n    If $x_n \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, then $f_A(x_n) = 0$.\n    In both cases, we have the inequality $0 \\le |f_A(x_n)| \\le |x_n|$.\n    Since $x_n \\to 0$, we know that $|x_n| \\to 0$. By the Squeeze Theorem, since $0 \\le |f_A(x_n)| \\le |x_n|$, we must have $|f_A(x_n)| \\to 0$, which implies $f_A(x_n) \\to 0$.\n    As this holds for any sequence $(x_n)$ converging to 0, $f_A$ is continuous at $x=0$.\n\n*   **Continuity at $c \\neq 0$**:\n    Case 1: $c \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $c \\neq 0$. Then $f_A(c) = c$. Since the irrationals are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we can choose a sequence of irrational numbers $(x_n)$ such that $x_n \\to c$. For every term in this sequence, $f_A(x_n) = 0$. Therefore, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_A(x_n) = 0$. However, $f_A(c) = c \\neq 0$. Since $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_A(x_n) \\neq f_A(c)$, the function is discontinuous at $c$.\n    Case 2: $c \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. Then $f_A(c) = 0$. Since the rationals are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we can choose a sequence of rational numbers $(x_n)$ such that $x_n \\to c$. For every term in this sequence, $f_A(x_n) = x_n$. Therefore, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_A(x_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = c$. However, $f_A(c) = 0$ and $c \\neq 0$. Since $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_A(x_n) \\neq f_A(c)$, the function is discontinuous at $c$.\n\nConclusion for A: $f_A$ is continuous only at $x=0$. This is a potential answer.\n\n**Analysis of Function B:**\n$f_B(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x \\notin \\mathbb{Q} \\end{cases}$ (This is the Dirichlet function).\n\n*   **Continuity at any point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$**: Let $c$ be any real number. We can find a sequence of rational numbers $(q_n)$ such that $q_n \\to c$. For this sequence, $f_B(q_n)=1$ for all $n$, so $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_B(q_n) = 1$. We can also find a sequence of irrational numbers $(i_n)$ such that $i_n \\to c$. For this sequence, $f_B(i_n)=0$ for all $n$, so $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_B(i_n) = 0$.\n    Since we have found two sequences converging to $c$ for which the function values converge to different limits (1 and 0), the limit $\\lim_{x\\to c} f_B(x)$ does not exist. Therefore, $f_B$ is not continuous at any point in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConclusion for B: $f_B$ is nowhere continuous. It does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**Analysis of Function C:**\n$f_C(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{q}  \\text{if } x = \\frac{p}{q} \\text{ is a non-zero rational number in lowest terms with } q  0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x \\text{ is an irrational number} \\\\ 1  \\text{if } x = 0 \\end{cases}$\n\n*   **Continuity at $x=0$**: By definition, $f_C(0) = 1$. Let's consider a sequence of irrational numbers $(x_n)$ converging to 0, for example, $x_n = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{n}$. Then $f_C(x_n) = 0$ for all $n$. The limit of this sequence of function values is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_C(x_n) = 0$. Since this limit (0) is not equal to the function's value at 0 ($f_C(0)=1$), the function is discontinuous at $x=0$.\n\nConclusion for C: Since $f_C$ is not continuous at $x=0$, it cannot be the answer.\n\n**Analysis of Function D:**\n$f_D(x) = \\begin{cases} \\cos(x) - 1  \\text{if } x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x \\notin \\mathbb{Q} \\end{cases}$\n\n*   **Continuity at a point $c$**: A function defined piecewise on $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q}$ like $f_D$ is continuous at a point $c$ if and only if the two defining rules agree at that point, assuming the rules themselves are continuous functions. Here, the rules are given by the functions $g(x) = \\cos(x)-1$ and $h(x)=0$. Both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Therefore, $f_D(x)$ is continuous at a point $c$ if and only if $\\lim_{x \\to c} f_D(x)$ exists and equals $f_D(c)$. This limit will exist if and only if the values of the two branches approach the same value. That is, at points $c$ where $g(c) = h(c)$.\n    So, we must find the points $c$ where $\\cos(c) - 1 = 0$. This equation simplifies to $\\cos(c) = 1$. The solutions are $c = 2\\pi k$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The set of points where $f_D$ is continuous is $\\{ \\dots, -4\\pi, -2\\pi, 0, 2\\pi, 4\\pi, \\dots \\}$.\n\nConclusion for D: $f_D$ is continuous at an infinite number of points, not just at $x=0$. It does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis of all four functions, only function $f_A$ is continuous at the single point $x=0$ and discontinuous everywhere else.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1292076"}]}
