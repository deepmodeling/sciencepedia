The floor function is constant on each interval $[m,m+1)$ for $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and has a jump at each integer input.\n\nGeneral principle: If $g$ is continuous, then $h(x)=\\lfloor g(x)\\rfloor$ is continuous at $x_{0}$ whenever $g(x_{0})\\notin\\mathbb{Z}$. If $g(x_{0})=m\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, continuity of $h$ at $x_{0}$ depends on whether $g$ takes values below $m$ arbitrarily close to $x_{0}$. Specifically:\n- If there are $x$ arbitrarily close to $x_{0}$ with $g(x)<m$, then $\\lfloor g(x)\\rfloor=m-1$ near $x_{0}$, while $h(x_{0})=\\lfloor m\\rfloor=m$, so $h$ is discontinuous at $x_{0}$.\n- If in some neighborhood of $x_{0}$ one has $g(x)\\geq m$ (so $x_{0}$ is a local minimum of $g$ at level $m$), then $\\lfloor g(x)\\rfloor=m$ near $x_{0}$, and $h$ is continuous at $x_{0}$.\n\nApply this to $g(x)=2\\sin(x)$, whose range is $[-2,2]$. The only integers in this range are $-2,-1,0,1,2$. Thus potential discontinuities occur where $2\\sin(x)\\in\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$.\n\n- If $2\\sin(x_{0})=-2$ (i.e., $\\sin(x_{0})=-1$), then $x_{0}$ is a local minimum of $g$. For $x$ near $x_0$, $g(x) \\geq -2$, with values in an interval like $[-2, -2+\\epsilon)$. Thus, $\\lfloor g(x) \\rfloor = -2$ throughout this neighborhood. Since $h(x_0) = \\lfloor-2\\rfloor = -2$, $h$ is continuous at $x_0$.\n\n- For $2\\sin(x_{0})\\in\\{-1,0,1,2\\}$:\n  - If $2\\sin(x_{0})=2$ (i.e., $\\sin(x_{0})=1$), then $x_{0}$ is a local maximum of $g$, and for $x\\neq x_{0}$ close to $x_{0}$ one has $g(x)\\in(1,2)$, so $\\lfloor g(x)\\rfloor=1$ while $h(x_{0})=2$; discontinuity occurs.\n  - If $2\\sin(x_{0})\\in\\{-1,0,1\\}$, then $g$ crosses the corresponding integer level (since $\\cos(x_{0})\\neq 0$ at those points), taking values both less than and greater than that integer arbitrarily close to $x_{0}$. Hence the left and right limiting values of $h$ differ, so $h$ is discontinuous at such $x_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, $h$ is discontinuous precisely at those $x$ for which $2\\sin(x)$ is an integer other than $-2$.

We consider the composition $g(x) = f(D(x))$, where $f$ is a continuous function and $D(x)$ is the notoriously nowhere-continuous Dirichlet function. The question at the heart of this problem is whether $g(x)$ can ever be continuous, and if so, what simple condition on the outer function $f$ makes this possible [@problem_id:1289599]. Solving this will reveal a deeper truth about continuity: the properties of a composition depend on a subtle interplay between the functions, not just the properties of the inner function alone.", "problem": "Let the Dirichlet function, denoted by $D(x)$, be defined for all real numbers $x$ as:\n$$\nD(x) = \\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if } x \\text{ is a rational number} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } x \\text{ is an irrational number} \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nConsider a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$.

Hence $g(x)=f(D(x))$ takes only the two values $f(1)$ (on rationals) and $f(0)$ (on irrationals).

Therefore, $f(0)=f(1)$ is necessary for continuity of $g$ at any $x$, and thus for continuity on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSufficiency: Suppose $f(0)=f(1)=c$ for some $c\\in\\mathbb{R}$.
