This is a classic application of the Squeeze Theorem.\n\nFirst, we need to establish bounding functions. Let's compare the two expressions, $x$ and $x^2 + 1/4$. Their difference is:\n$$ (x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}) - x = x^2 - x + \\frac{1}{4} = (x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 $$\nSince the square of any real number is non-negative, $(x - 1/2)^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x$. This implies that $x^2 + 1/4 \\ge x$ for all $x$.\n\nFor any input $x$, the function $f(x)$ takes one of these two values. Therefore, $f(x)$ is always greater than or equal to $x$ and less than or equal to $x^2 + 1/4$. This gives us the crucial inequality:\n$$ x \\le f(x) \\le x^2 + \\frac{1}{4} $$\nWe have successfully \"squeezed\" $f(x)$ between two simpler functions, $g(x) = x$ and $h(x) = x^2 + 1/4$.\n\nNow, we find the limits of these bounding functions as $x \\to 1/2$:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 1/2} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1/2} x = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 1/2} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1/2} \\left(x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nBoth the lower bound and the upper bound converge to the same value, $L = 1/2$.\n\nAccording to the Squeeze Theorem, since $f(x)$ is trapped between two functions that both approach $1/2$, $f(x)$ must also approach $1/2$.\n$$ \\lim_{x\\to \\frac{1}{2}} f(x)=\\frac{1}{2} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "1339638"}, {"introduction": "Evaluating the limit of a sequence defined by a summation can be challenging, but the Squeeze Theorem offers an elegant pathway.

The area of the rectangle with height $f(k)$ and width 1 is an upper bound for the integral over this interval.\n\nSumming this inequality from $k = n+1$ to $k = 2n$, we get an upper bound for our sum:\n$$ \\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\geq \\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} \\int_{k}^{k+1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\,dx = \\int_{n+1}^{2n+1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\,dx $$\n\nSimilarly, we can use the inequality:\n$$ f(k) \\leq \\int_{k-1}^{k} f(x) \\,dx $$\nSumming this from $k=n+1$ to $k=2n$, we have:\n$$ \\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\leq \\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} \\int_{k-1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\,dx = \\int_{n}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\,dx $$\n\nCombining these two results, we have bounded the sum $S_n$:\n$$ \\int_{n+1}^{2n+1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\,dx \\leq \\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\leq \\int_{n}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\,dx $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the integrals.
