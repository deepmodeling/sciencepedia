At $V=1$, $f(1)=1$, which is positive. Since $f(V)$ is continuous and goes from a negative value to a positive value on the interval $(0, 1]$, the IVT guarantees there must be at least one root in $(0, 1)$. Furthermore, since $f'(V) = 1/V - 1  0$ for all $V \\in (0,1)$, the function is strictly increasing on this interval. Therefore, there is exactly one root in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n\n-   **Interval 2: $[1, \\infty)$**\n    The function $f(V)$ is continuous on $[1, \\infty)$. At $V=1$, $f(1)=1$, which is positive. As $V \\to \\infty$, $f(V) \\to -\\infty$, meaning we can find a large $V$ for which $f(V)$ is negative. For instance, $f(4) = \\ln(4) - 4 + 2 = \\ln(4) - 2 \\approx 1.386 - 2 = -0.614  0$. Since $f(V)$ is continuous and goes from a positive value to a negative value on the interval $(1, \\infty)$, the IVT guarantees there must be at least one root in $(1, \\infty)$. Furthermore, since $f'(V) = 1/V - 1  0$ for all $V > 1$, the function is strictly decreasing on this interval. Therefore, there is exactly one root in the interval $(1, \\infty)$.\n\nCombining these results, there is exactly one root in $(0, 1)$ and exactly one root in $(1, \\infty)$.
