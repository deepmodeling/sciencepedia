This problem [@problem_id:1291995] features a function defined one way for rational numbers and another for irrationals, a construction that challenges our geometric intuition.

The function $f(x)$ is defined piecewise, switching between $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ depending on whether $x$ is rational or irrational.\n\nFor the function $f(x)$ to be continuous at a point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, a necessary condition is that the limits of both pieces of the function must agree at $c$. Since both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are continuous, for any point $c$, the limit of $g(x)$ as $x \\to c$ is $g(c)$, and the limit of $h(x)$ as $x \\to c$ is $h(c)$.\nDue to the density of rational numbers and irrational numbers in $\\mathbb{R}$, for any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can find a sequence of rational numbers $(q_n)$ converging to $c$ and a sequence of irrational numbers $(r_n)$ converging to $c$.\nFor continuity of $f$ at $c$, we need $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c)$.

If we choose $\\delta \\le 1$, then $|x-2|<1 \\implies 1<x<3 \\implies 3<x+2<5$, so $|x+2|<5$. Thus, $|f(x)-3| < 5|x-2| < 5\\delta$.

We must show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $|x-(-1)| = |x+1| < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - 0| = |f(x)| < \\epsilon$.\nIf $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $|x+1| < \\delta$, then $|f(x)| = |x^2-1| = |x-1||x+1|$. If we choose $\\delta \\le 1$, then $|x+1|<1 \\implies -2<x<0 \\implies -3<x-1<-1$, so $|x-1|<3$. Thus, $|f(x)| < 3|x+1| < 3\\delta$. We need $3\\delta \\le \\epsilon$, so $\\delta \\le \\epsilon/3$.\nIf $x \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$ and $|x+1| < \\delta$, then $|f(x)| = |x+1| < \\delta$.
