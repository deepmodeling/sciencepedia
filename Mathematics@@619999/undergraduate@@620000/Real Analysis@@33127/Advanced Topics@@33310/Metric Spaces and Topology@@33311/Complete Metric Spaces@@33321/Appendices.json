A fundamental principle is: if $(X,d)$ is complete and $Y \\subseteq X$, then the metric subspace $Y$ is complete if and only if $Y$ is closed in $X$. Proof sketch: if $Y$ is closed and $(y_{n})$ is Cauchy in $Y$, then it is Cauchy in $X$ and converges in $X$ to some $y$. Since $Y$ is closed, $y \\in Y$, so $Y$ is complete. Conversely, if $Y$ is complete, then every sequence in $Y$ converging in $X$ must converge to a point of $Y$, which implies $Y$ is closed.\n\nWe apply this to each subset.\n\nA. $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$. Indeed, if $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$, let $n=\\lfloor x \\rfloor$; then $\\min\\{|x-n|,|x-(n+1)|\\}>0$, so the open ball about $x$ with radius $\\frac{1}{2}\\min\\{|x-n|,|x-(n+1)|\\}$ misses $\\mathbb{Z}$.

Equivalently, any Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is eventually constant and thus convergent in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nB. $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ because it omits irrational limits of rational sequences; for instance, there exists a sequence $(q_{n}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}$ with $q_{n} \\to \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not complete.\n\nC. $(0,1)$ is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}$. For example, the sequence $x_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}$ lies in $(0,1)$ and is Cauchy with limit $0 \\notin (0,1)$. Thus $(0,1)$ is not complete.\n\nD. $[0,1)$ is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}$. For example, $x_{n}=1-\\frac{1}{n}$ lies in $[0,1)$ and is Cauchy with limit $1 \\notin [0,1)$. Thus $[0,1)$ is not complete.\n\nE. $S=\\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n \\geq 1\\} \\cup \\{0\\}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$. Any convergent sequence in $S$ either stabilizes at some $1/n$ (and hence converges to that $1/n \\in S$) or has terms with $n \\to \\infty$, in which case it converges to $0 \\in S$.
