The drone's final destination is the target point $T = (0, 1)$. In this navigation system, the distance between any two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is measured using the taxicab metric, defined as $d_1((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$.\n\nThe mission protocol defines the drone as having \"arrived\" if its distance to the target is strictly less than a specified tolerance, $\\epsilon$.
