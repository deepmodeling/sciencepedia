We analyze the effect of removing a single point from a connected set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by providing examples that show different outcomes, and we justify each outcome with standard topological arguments.\n\nFirst, show that it is not always disconnected. Take $S=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ (which is connected). Let $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Then $S\\setminus \\{p\\}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus \\{p\\}$ is path-connected, hence connected. To see path-connectedness: given $x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus \\{p\\}$, if the straight segment from $x$ to $y$ avoids $p$ we are done. If $p$ lies on that segment, choose a point $q\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $q\\neq x,y,p$ such that the triples $\\{x,q,p\\}$ and $\\{y,q,p\\}$ are not colinear (this is possible since the union of the two lines through $p$ and $x$, and through $p$ and $y$, is a proper subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$). Then the straight segments $[x,q]$ and $[q,y]$ do not contain $p$ (because $p$ is not colinear with their endpoints), so the piecewise linear path $[x,q]\\cup[q,y]$ lies in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus \\{p\\}$. Therefore $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus \\{p\\}$ is path-connected and hence connected. Thus option A is false.\n\nSecond, show that it is not always connected. Let $S=[0,1]\\times \\{0\\}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which is connected (it is homeomorphic to the interval $[0,1]$). Let $p=(\\frac{1}{2},0)$. Then\n$$\nS\\setminus \\{p\\}=\\left(\\left[0,\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\times \\{0\\}\\right)\\cup \\left(\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},1\\right]\\times \\{0\\}\\right).\n$$\nDefine the disjoint open sets $U=(-\\infty,\\tfrac{1}{2})\\times \\mathbb{R}$ and $V=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\infty)\\times \\mathbb{R}$. Then $S' \\subseteq U \\cup V$, and we have $S' \\cap U = [0,\\tfrac{1}{2})\\times \\{0\\}$ and $S' \\cap V = (\\tfrac{1}{2},1]\\times \\{0\\}$, both of which are non-empty. This forms a separation of $S'$, so $S'$ is disconnected. Therefore option C is false.\n\nThird, show that openness or closedness of $S$ does not by itself determine the outcome (so D is false). Indeed:\n- There exists a closed connected $S$ for which $S\\setminus \\{p\\}$ is connected: take $S=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\}$ (the unit circle, which is closed and connected) and any $p\\in S$. Then $S\\setminus \\{p\\}$ is homeomorphic to an open interval via stereographic projection, hence connected.\n- There exists a closed connected $S$ for which $S\\setminus \\{p\\}$ is disconnected: the segment example $S=[0,1]\\times \\{0\\}$ above is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and $S\\setminus \\{p\\}$ is disconnected.\nSince both behaviors occur within closed sets alone, the connectedness of $S\\setminus \\{p\\}$ does not depend specifically on $S$ being open or closed.\n\nCombining these, we conclude that $S\\setminus \\{p\\}$ can be connected or disconnected depending on the particular $S$ and $p$.

We analyze each property separately.\n\nFirst, we recall the definitions. A set $A$ is **path-connected** if for any two points $p_1, p_2 \\in A$, there exists a continuous function $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to A$ (a path) such that $\\gamma(0) = p_1$ and $\\gamma(1) = p_2$. A set is **connected** if it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint, non-empty, open subsets. A key theorem states that any path-connected set is also connected. This immediately implies that option B, \"$S$ is path-connected but not connected,\" is logically impossible and can be eliminated.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Path-Connectedness**\n\nTo determine if $S$ is path-connected, we test if we can connect any two points in $S$ with a path that lies entirely within $S$. Let's choose a point from one \"arm\" and another point from a different \"arm\". Let $p_1 = (0, -0.5) \\in L_1$ and $p_2 = (1, 1) \\in L_2$.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a continuous path $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to S$ with $\\gamma(0) = p_1$ and $\\gamma(1) = p_2$. Let the path be represented by its coordinate functions $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_x(t), \\gamma_y(t))$. Both $\\gamma_x(t)$ and $\\gamma_y(t)$ are continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nConsider the y-coordinate function, $\\gamma_y(t)$. At the start of the path, $\\gamma_y(0) = -0.5$. At the end of the path, $\\gamma_y(1) = 1$. Since $\\gamma_y(t)$ is a continuous function on a closed interval, the Intermediate Value Theorem applies. This theorem guarantees that for any value $c$ between $-0.5$ and $1$, there must be some $t_0 \\in (0, 1)$ such that $\\gamma_y(t_0) = c$. Let's choose $c=0$. So, there must exist a $t_0 \\in (0, 1)$ such that $\\gamma_y(t_0) = 0$.\n\nThis means the point $p_0 = \\gamma(t_0)$ on the path has a y-coordinate of 0. Since the entire path $\\gamma$ must lie in $S$, the point $p_0$ must be in $S$. Let's check which points in $S = L_1 \\cup L_2 \\cup L_3$ have a y-coordinate of 0.\n- For any point $(0, y) \\in L_1$, we have $-1 \\le y  0$, so $y \\neq 0$.\n- For any point $(t, t) \\in L_2$, we have $y=t$ and $0  t \\le 1$, so $y \\neq 0$.\n- For any point $(-t, t) \\in L_3$, we have $y=t$ and $0  t \\le 1$, so $y \\neq 0$.\n\nThere are no points in the set $S$ with a y-coordinate of 0. This contradicts the fact that the point $p_0 = \\gamma(t_0)$ must be in $S$. Therefore, our initial assumption that such a path exists must be false.\n\nWe conclude that $S$ is not path-connected. This eliminates option A. We are now left to decide between C, D, and E.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Connectedness**\n\nA set is disconnected if it can be partitioned into two non-empty, disjoint subsets that are both closed in the subspace topology. Let's examine the subsets $L_1, L_2, L_3$. The set $S$ is the disjoint union $L_1 \\cup L_2 \\cup L_3$. If we can show that one of these pieces, say $L_1$, is both open and closed in $S$, then $S$ is disconnected. A subset is both open and closed (clopen) if and only if both the subset and its complement are closed.\n\nLet's show that $L_1$ is a closed subset of $S$. A subset $A$ of $S$ is closed in $S$ if it contains all of its limit points that are also in $S$. The set of all limit points of $L_1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is its closure, $\\overline{L_1}$. The closure of $L_1 = \\{ (0, y) \\mid -1 \\le y  0 \\}$ is $\\overline{L_1} = \\{ (0, y) \\mid -1 \\le y \\le 0 \\} = L_1 \\cup \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nThe limit points of $L_1$ that are in $S$ are the points in the set $\\overline{L_1} \\cap S$.\n$\\overline{L_1} \\cap S = (L_1 \\cup \\{(0,0)\\}) \\cap (L_1 \\cup L_2 \\cup L_3)$.\nSince the sets $L_1, L_2, L_3$ are disjoint and none contain the origin $(0,0)$, this simplifies to:\n$\\overline{L_1} \\cap S = (L_1 \\cap L_1) \\cup (L_1 \\cap L_2) \\cup (L_1 \\cap L_3) \\cup (\\{\\text{(0,0)}\\} \\cap S) = L_1 \\cup \\emptyset \\cup \\emptyset \\cup \\emptyset = L_1$.\nSince all limit points of $L_1$ that lie in $S$ are contained in $L_1$, $L_1$ is a closed set in the subspace topology of $S$.\n\nBy the exact same reasoning, $L_2$ and $L_3$ are also closed subsets of $S$.\n\nNow consider the complement of $L_1$ in $S$, which is $S \\setminus L_1 = L_2 \\cup L_3$. Since $L_2$ and $L_3$ are closed in $S$, their finite union, $L_2 \\cup L_3$, is also closed in $S$.\nSo, we have shown that $L_1$ is closed in $S$, and its complement $L_2 \\cup L_3$ is also closed in $S$. By definition, this means $L_1$ is also an open set in $S$.\n\nThus, $L_1$ is a proper (since $L_2, L_3$ are not empty), non-empty, clopen (closed and open) subset of $S$. The existence of such a subset proves that $S$ is disconnected.\n\nThis eliminates option C.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have demonstrated that $S$ is not path-connected and also not connected. This corresponds to option D.\n\nFor completeness, let's consider option E. Connectedness and path-connectedness are topological properties, meaning they depend only on the open sets of the space. All metrics on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that are derived from a norm (like the standard Euclidean metric, the Manhattan metric, etc.) induce the same standard topology. Therefore, these properties are independent of the specific choice of such a metric. Option E is incorrect.\n\nThe correct statement is that $S$ is neither connected nor path-connected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1290953"}]}
