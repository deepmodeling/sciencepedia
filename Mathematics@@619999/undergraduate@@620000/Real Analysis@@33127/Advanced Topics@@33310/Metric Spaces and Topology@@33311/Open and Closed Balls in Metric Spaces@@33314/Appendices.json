We must find all integers $z$ that satisfy the inequality $|n - z|  r$.\n\nLet's analyze the quantity $|n - z|$. Since $n$ and $z$ are both integers, their difference, $(n - z)$, is also an integer. The absolute value of an integer, $|n - z|$, must be a non-negative integer. That is, $|n - z|$ can only take values from the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\n\nNow, we combine this property with the inequality $|n - z|  r$ and the constraint $0  r \\le 1$.\nThe inequality can be written as:\n$$|n - z|  r \\le 1$$\n\nThis implies that we are looking for non-negative integers $|n - z|$ that are strictly less than a number $r$ which is at most 1. The only non-negative integer that is strictly less than 1 (or any number less than or equal to 1) is 0.\n\nTherefore, the inequality $|n - z|  r$ for $0  r \\le 1$ can only be satisfied if:\n$$|n - z| = 0$$\n\nThis equation holds if and only if $n - z = 0$, which means $z = n$.\n\nThis shows that for any radius $r$ in the interval $(0, 1]$, the only integer $z$ that satisfies the condition to be in the open ball $B(n, r)$ is the center $n$ itself. This is true even for the boundary case $r=1$, where the condition $|n-z|1$ still excludes any integer $z \\neq n$ because for such $z$, the smallest possible value for $|n-z|$ is 1, which is not strictly less than 1.\n\nThus, the open ball is the set containing only the element $n$.\n$$B(n, r) = \\{n\\}$$\n\nNow we compare this result with the given options:\nA.

Let the two open balls be $B(x_1, r_1)$ and $B(x_2, r_2)$.\n\nFirst, let's express these open balls as sets on the real line. The definition of an open ball $B(c, r)$ is $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |x - c|  r \\}$. This inequality is equivalent to $-r  x - c  r$, which simplifies to $c - r  x  c + r$. This is the definition of an open interval $(c-r, c+r)$.\n\nSo, we can represent the two open balls as open intervals:\n$B(x_1, r_1) = (x_1 - r_1, x_1 + r_1)$\n$B(x_2, r_2) = (x_2 - r_2, x_2 + r_2)$\n\nThe intersection set $S$ is the intersection of these two open intervals:\n$S = (x_1 - r_1, x_1 + r_1) \\cap (x_2 - r_2, x_2 + r_2)$\n\nThe intersection of two open intervals $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ is given by $(\\max(a, c), \\min(b, d))$. The intersection is non-empty if and only if $\\max(a, c)  \\min(b, d)$. Otherwise, the intersection is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nLet's apply this to our set $S$.\nThe left endpoint of the intersection interval is $L = \\max(x_1 - r_1, x_2 - r_2)$.\nThe right endpoint of the intersection interval is $R = \\min(x_1 + r_1, x_2 + r_2)$.\n\nTwo cases arise for the set $S$:\n\nCase 1: The intersection is empty.\nThis happens if the intervals do not overlap, which occurs when $L \\geq R$. This condition is equivalent to the distance between the centers, $|x_1 - x_2|$, being greater than or equal to the sum of the radii, $r_1 + r_2$. If $|x_1 - x_2| \\geq r_1 + r_2$, the balls are either separated or touch at a single point, but since the balls are open, their intersection is the empty set. So, $S = \\emptyset$ is a possible outcome.\n\nCase 2: The intersection is non-empty.\nThis happens if the intervals overlap, which occurs when $L  R$. This condition is equivalent to $|x_1 - x_2|  r_1 + r_2$. In this case, the intersection is the open interval $S = (L, R)$.\n\nNow, we must determine if this resulting non-empty open interval $(L, R)$ is an open ball. An open ball in $\\mathbb{R}$ is, by definition, an open interval. To show this explicitly, we need to find a center $c$ and a radius $r > 0$ such that $B(c, r) = (L, R)$.\nThe center of an interval $(L, R)$ is its midpoint: $c = \\frac{L+R}{2}$.\nThe radius is half its length: $r = \\frac{R-L}{2}$.\nSince we are in the case where $L  R$, the radius $r$ is strictly positive.\nThen, the open ball $B(c, r)$ is:\n$$B\\left(\\frac{L+R}{2}, \\frac{R-L}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{L+R}{2} - \\frac{R-L}{2}, \\frac{L+R}{2} + \\frac{R-L}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2L}{2}, \\frac{2R}{2}\\right) = (L, R)$$\nThus, any non-empty open interval is an open ball in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nCombining both cases, the intersection $S$ is either the empty set or a non-empty open interval, which is itself an open ball. Therefore, the set $S$ is either the empty set or an open ball.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. $S$ is always a non-empty open ball. This is false, as shown in Case 1 where $S$ can be the empty set.\nB. $S$ is either the empty set or a set containing a single point. This is false. The intersection of two open sets is always an open set. A single point is a closed set, not an open set in the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}$. The intersection could only be a single point if we were intersecting two closed balls that just touch.\nC. $S$ is either the empty set or an open ball. This is true, as demonstrated by our analysis of the two cases.\nD. $S$ is always a bounded open interval, but not necessarily an open ball. This is false. While $S$ (if non-empty) is indeed a bounded open interval, every bounded open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is an open ball, as shown above. This option creates a false distinction.\nE. $S$ is guaranteed to be an open ball only if one ball is a subset of the other. This is false. Case 2 shows that as long as the balls overlap at all ($|x_1 - x_2|  r_1 + r_2$), their intersection is a non-empty open interval and therefore an open ball. This happens even when neither ball is a subset of the other.\n\nThe most accurate and complete description among the choices is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1312635"}, {"introduction": "This final practice delves into a more profound and counter-intuitive aspect of metric spaces, using the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.
