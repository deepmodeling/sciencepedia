This exercise asks how the dimension of a set changes when we uniformly scale it—stretching or shrinking it by the same factor in all directions.

Let's explore a fundamental property of this dimension.\n\nThe definition relies on the concept of a \"cover\". For a set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and a small positive number $\\delta$, a $\\delta$-cover of $S$ is a collection of sets $\\{U_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$ such that $S \\subset \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} U_i$ and the diameter of each set, $\\text{diam}(U_i)$, is less than or equal to $\\delta$.\n\nFor a given exponent $s \\ge 0$, the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure, $H^s(S)$, is defined via these covers. For our purposes, we only need to know its behavior: for any given set $S$, there is a unique critical value for the exponent $s$, called the Hausdorff dimension of $S$, denoted $\\dim_H(S)$. This value has the property that:\n- If $s > \\dim_H(S)$, the measure $H^s(S) = 0$.\n- If $s < \\dim_H(S)$, the measure $H^s(S) = \\infty$.\n\nConsider a non-empty set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ which has a known finite Hausdorff dimension, $\\dim_H(S) = d$.
