A standard result states that any finite-dimensional linear subspace of a normed space is closed. For completeness of the argument: the linear map $T:\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\to C([0,1])$ given by $T(a_{0},\\dots,a_{n})=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}x^{k}$ is a linear isomorphism onto $\\mathcal{P}_{n}$; since $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is complete and all norms on a finite-dimensional space are equivalent, the image $\\mathcal{P}_{n}$ is complete in the induced norm and thus closed in $C([0,1])$.\n\nNext, each proper finite-dimensional subspace has empty interior in an infinite-dimensional normed space.
