We will check if the definition of uniform equicontinuity holds for $\\mathcal{G}$.\n\nOur goal is to show that for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find a single $\\delta > 0$ (independent of the specific function $g_f \\in \\mathcal{G}$ and the points $x, y$) such that for all $g_f \\in \\mathcal{G}$ and all $x, y \\in [0, 1]$, if $|x - y| < \\delta$, then $|g_f(x) - g_f(y)| < \\epsilon$.\n\nLet an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$ be given.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the family $\\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly equicontinuous on $[0, 1]$.

For any function $g_f \\in \\mathcal{G}$ and any two points $x, y \\in [0, 1]$, we are interested in the expression $|g_f(x) - g_f(y)|$. Using the definition of $g_f$, we can write:\n$$ |g_f(x) - g_f(y)| = |f(x^2) - f(y^2)| $$\nNotice that this expression has the form $|f(u) - f(v)|$ where $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$.\nSince $x, y \\in [0, 1]$, their squares $x^2$ and $y^2$ are also in $[0, 1]$.

Let's analyze the term $|x^2 - y^2|$:\n$$ |x^2 - y^2| = |(x - y)(x + y)| = |x - y| (x + y) $$\nSince $x, y \\in [0, 1]$, the sum $x+y$ is bounded.

Then, as shown above:\n$$ |x^2 - y^2| \\le 2|x - y| < 2 \\left( \\frac{\\delta_{\\mathcal{F}}}{2} \\right) = \\delta_{\\mathcal{F}} $$\nWith $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$, we have $|u - v| < \\delta_{\\mathcal{F}}$. Because $\\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly equicontinuous, this implies that for any $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$:\n$$ |f(u) - f(v)| < \\epsilon $$\nSubstituting back $u=x^2$ and $v=y^2$, we get:\n$$ |f(x^2) - f(y^2)| < \\epsilon $$\nThis is precisely $|g_f(x) - g_f(y)| < \\epsilon$.\n\nSince our choice of $\\delta = \\frac{\\delta_{\\mathcal{F}}}{2}$ works for any $g_f \\in \\mathcal{G}$ (because $\\delta_{\\mathcal{F}}$ worked for any $f\\in\\mathcal{F}$) and any $x, y \\in [0, 1]$, we have successfully shown that the family $\\mathcal{G}$ is uniformly equicontinuous on $[0, 1]$.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.
