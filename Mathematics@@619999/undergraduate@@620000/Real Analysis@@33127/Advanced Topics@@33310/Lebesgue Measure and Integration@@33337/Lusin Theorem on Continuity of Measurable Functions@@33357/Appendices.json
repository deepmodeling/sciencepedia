We will follow a standard constructive proof of Lusin's theorem for this specific case and then analyze the properties of the resulting set $K$.\n\nFirst, let's construct the set $K$.\nThe set of rational numbers in $[0,1]$, denoted $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$, is countable. Let us enumerate these rational numbers as a sequence $\\{q_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$.\nThe Lebesgue measure of any countable set is zero, so $m(\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]) = 0$.\nOur goal is to remove a small open set from $[0,1]$ that contains all these rational numbers. Let a value for $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$ be given.\nFor each rational number $q_n$ in our enumeration, we can define an open interval $I_n$ centered at $q_n$. Let $I_n = (q_n - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^{n+2}}, q_n + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^{n+2}})$. The length of this interval is $m(I_n) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^{n+1}}$.\nNow, define an open set $U$ as the union of all these intervals: $U = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n$. By construction, $U$ is an open set and it contains every rational number in $[0,1]$ (i.e., $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1] \\subset U$).\n\nWe now define our set $K$ as the part of $[0,1]$ that remains after removing $U$: $K = [0,1] \\setminus U$.\n\nNext, we verify that this set $K$ satisfies the conditions given by Lusin's theorem.\n1.  **Compactness:** The set $U$ is a union of open sets, so it is an open set. The set $[0,1]$ is a closed set. Therefore, $K = [0,1] \\setminus U = [0,1] \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus U)$ is the intersection of two closed sets, which is itself a closed set. Since $K$ is a subset of $[0,1]$, it is also bounded. In $\\mathbb{R}$, a closed and bounded set is compact. Thus, $K$ is compact.\n\n2.  **Measure of the complement:** The complement of $K$ in $[0,1]$ is $[0,1] \\setminus K = [0,1] \\cap U$. The measure of this set can be bounded using the subadditivity property of the Lebesgue measure:\n    $$m([0,1] \\setminus K) = m([0,1] \\cap U) \\le m(U) = m\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n\\right) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} m(I_n)$$\n    Substituting the lengths of the intervals $I_n$:\n    $$m([0,1] \\setminus K) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon}{2^{n+1}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}  \\epsilon.$$\n    Thus, the measure condition is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Continuity of the restriction $f|_K$:** By our construction, the open set $U$ contains all rational numbers in $[0,1]$. This means the set $K = [0,1] \\setminus U$ contains no rational numbers. Every element of $K$ must be an irrational number.\n    The function $f(x)=\\chi_{\\mathbb{Q}}(x)$ is defined to be 0 for all irrational numbers. Therefore, for any $x \\in K$, we have $f(x) = 0$. The restriction $f|_K$ is the constant function that maps every element of $K$ to 0. A constant function is everywhere continuous on its domain. Thus, $f|_K$ is continuous.\n\nNow that we have constructed a valid set $K$, we check statements (I) and (II).\n\n**Analysis of Statement (I): $K$ must be a subset of the irrational numbers.**\nAs shown in step 3 of our verification, the set $K$ we constructed consists exclusively of irrational numbers. This is because we deliberately removed an open set $U$ that contained all the rationals in $[0,1]$. Therefore, statement (I) is true for our constructed set $K$.\n\n**Analysis of Statement (II): $K$ must have an empty interior.**\nThe interior of a set is the largest open set contained within it. An equivalent definition states that a point $x$ is in the interior of $K$ if there exists some $\\delta  0$ such that the open interval $(x-\\delta, x+\\delta)$ is entirely contained in $K$.\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the interior of $K$ is non-empty. This would mean that $K$ contains at least one open interval, say $(a,b)$ with $ab$.\nHowever, a fundamental property of the real number system is that any non-empty open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers.\nThis leads to a contradiction. Our constructed set $K$ contains only irrational numbers (as established in the analysis of statement I), so it cannot contain the interval $(a,b)$, which is guaranteed to have rational numbers.\nTherefore, our assumption must be false. The interior of $K$ must be empty. So, statement (II) is also true for our constructed set $K$.\n\nSince both statements (I) and (II) must be true for our valid construction of $K$, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1309703"}]}
