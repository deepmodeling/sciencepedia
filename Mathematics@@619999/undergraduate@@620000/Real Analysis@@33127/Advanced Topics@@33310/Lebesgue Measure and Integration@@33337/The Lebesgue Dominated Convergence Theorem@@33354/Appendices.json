This limit depends on the behavior of $u^{1/n}$.\n- For any fixed $u  0$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} u^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} e^{\\frac{\\ln u}{n}} = e^0 = 1$.\n- Since $g$ is continuous, for any $u  0$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} g(u^{1/n}) = g(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} u^{1/n}) = g(1)$.\n- Therefore, for $u0$, the pointwise limit is $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(u) = g(1)e^{-u}$.\n- At the point $u=0$, we have $u^{1/n} = 0$ for all $n$.

This means there exists a constant $M  0$ such that $|g(t)| \\le M$ for all $t \\in [0, \\infty)$.\nLet's bound our sequence of functions $|f_n(u)|$:\n$$ |f_n(u)| = |g(u^{1/n}) e^{-u}| = |g(u^{1/n})| e^{-u}. $$\nSince $u^{1/n} \\in [0, \\infty)$ for $u \\in [0, \\infty)$, we can use the bound on $g$:\n$$ |f_n(u)| \\le M e^{-u}. $$\nLet's define our dominating function as $H(u) = M e^{-u}$.
