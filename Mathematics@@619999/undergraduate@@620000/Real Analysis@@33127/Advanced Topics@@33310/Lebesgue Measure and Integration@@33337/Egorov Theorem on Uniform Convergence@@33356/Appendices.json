The condition states that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n \\ge N$ and for all $x \\in A_{\\delta}$, we have $|f_n(x)| < \\epsilon$.\nSince the pointwise limit on $A_{\\delta}$ is the zero function, $f(x)=0$, this condition can be rewritten as $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon$. This is the definition of uniform convergence of the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ to the function $f(x)=0$ on the set $A_{\\delta}$.\n\nTo check if this condition is met, we must determine if the convergence of $f_n$ to $0$ is uniform on $A_{\\delta} = [\\delta, 1]$.
