Since $x$ ranges from $0$ to $10$, the floor of $x$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, can take any integer value from $\\lfloor 0 \\rfloor = 0$ to $\\lfloor 10 \\rfloor = 10$. Thus, the possible values for $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\n\nThe condition for an element $x$ to be in the set $S$ is that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ must be an even number.
