That is, for every fixed $x \\in [0, 1]$, we must have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\phi_n(x) = x$.\n\nA standard method for constructing such a sequence is to partition the domain of the function into smaller pieces and define the simple function to be constant on each piece. A convenient way to do this is to use a dyadic partition.\n\nFor each positive integer $n$, we partition the interval $[0, 1]$ into $2^n$ subintervals. We can define our simple function $\\phi_n(x)$ on each subinterval to approximate $f(x)=x$. A natural choice is to set the value of $\\phi_n(x)$ to be the value of $f(x)$ at the left endpoint of the subinterval containing $x$.\n\nLet's make this construction precise. For any $x \\in [0, 1]$, we want to find the subinterval of the form $[\\frac{k}{2^n}, \\frac{k+1}{2^n})$ that contains $x$. The integer $k$ would depend on both $n$ and $x$. We can express this relationship using the floor function, denoted by $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$.\n\nFor a given $x \\in [0, 1]$ and a given $n \\ge 1$, let's consider the value of $2^n x$.

For a fixed $n$, the possible values for the integer $k = \\lfloor 2^n x \\rfloor$ as $x$ ranges over $[0, 1]$ are $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nThe function $\\phi_n(x)$ takes on the value $\\frac{k}{2^n}$ for $x$ in the set $S_k = \\{x \\in [0, 1] : \\lfloor 2^n x \\rfloor = k\\}$.\nFor $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2^n-1\\}$, the set $S_k$ is the interval $[\\frac{k}{2^n}, \\frac{k+1}{2^n})$.\nFor $k = 2^n$, the set $S_{2^n}$ corresponds to $\\lfloor 2^n x \\rfloor = 2^n$, which holds only for $x=1$. So, $S_{2^n}=\\{1\\}$.\nThus, $\\phi_n(x)$ can be written explicitly as a linear combination of characteristic functions:\n$$\n\\phi_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1} \\frac{k}{2^n} \\chi_{[\\frac{k}{2^n}, \\frac{k+1}{2^n})}(x) + \\frac{2^n}{2^n} \\chi_{\\{1\\}}(x)\n$$\nSince this is a finite sum (with $2^n+1$ terms) of characteristic functions of measurable sets (intervals and a point), $\\phi_n(x)$ is a simple function for each $n$.\n\nNext, we must show that this sequence converges pointwise to $f(x)=x$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nFrom the inequality $\\phi_n(x) \\le x < \\phi_n(x) + \\frac{1}{2^n}$ derived earlier, we can subtract $x$ from all parts:\n$$\n\\phi_n(x) - x \\le 0 < \\phi_n(x) - x + \\frac{1}{2^n}\n$$\nOr, focusing on the distance between $x$ and $\\phi_n(x)$:\n$$\n0 \\le x - \\phi_n(x) < \\frac{1}{2^n}\n$$\nThis inequality holds for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. As $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ approaches $0$.
