An $F_{\\sigma}$ set is a countable union of closed sets. We need to check if $A$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $F_{\\sigma}$ sets.\n\nThe set $A$ is defined as $A = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} [n, n + 2^{-n}]$. Each interval $[n, n + 2^{-n}]$ is a closed interval, and therefore a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$. The set $A$ is a union of a countable collection of these closed sets (indexed by the natural numbers $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$). By definition, $A$ is an $F_{\\sigma}$ set.\n\nThe set $B = \\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of rational numbers. The set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. We can express $\\mathbb{Q}$ as the union of all its singleton elements: $\\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcup_{q \\in \\mathbb{Q}} \\{q\\}$. In the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}$, any singleton set $\\{q\\}$ is a closed set. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set, this is a countable union of closed sets. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is an $F_{\\sigma}$ set.\n\nNow we consider the set $C = A \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$. A fundamental property of $F_{\\sigma}$ sets is that the intersection of two $F_{\\sigma}$ sets is also an $F_{\\sigma}$ set. To see this, let $X = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} X_i$ and $Y = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} Y_j$ be two $F_{\\sigma}$ sets, where each $X_i$ and $Y_j$ is a closed set. Their intersection is given by:\n$$X \\cap Y = \\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} X_i\\right) \\cap \\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} Y_j\\right) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} (X_i \\cap Y_j)$$\nThe intersection of two closed sets, $X_i \\cap Y_j$, is a closed set. The set of all pairs $(i, j)$ where $i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is a countable set (since $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ is countable). Thus, $X \\cap Y$ is a countable union of closed sets, making it an $F_{\\sigma}$ set.\nSince both $A$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $F_{\\sigma}$ sets, their intersection $C = A \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ must be an $F_{\\sigma}$ set. This immediately shows that statement E is incorrect.\n\nNext, let's evaluate the other options.\n\nStatement D claims $C$ is a finite set. The set $C$ is the set of all rational numbers that fall into any of the intervals $[n, n + 2^{-n}]$. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, the interval $[n, n + 2^{-n}]$ has a positive length of $2^{-n}$. By the density of rational numbers in $\\mathbb{R}$, any non-empty interval contains infinitely many rational numbers. Thus, for each $n$, the set $[n, n + 2^{-n}] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ is an infinite set. The set $C$ is the union of all these infinite sets, so $C$ is an infinite set. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.\n\nStatement A claims $C$ is an open set. A set is open if it contains an open neighborhood around each of its points. Let's pick any point $q \\in C$. Since $q \\in C$, $q$ must be a rational number. By the density of irrational numbers, any open interval $(q-\\epsilon, q+\\epsilon)$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$ will contain irrational numbers. These irrational numbers are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, and therefore not in $C$. This means no open neighborhood of $q$ is entirely contained within $C$. Thus, $C$ contains no interior points, so it cannot be an open set. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nStatement B claims $C$ is a closed set. A set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points. Let's try to find a limit point of $C$ that is not in $C$. Consider the first interval in the definition of $A$, which is $[1, 1 + 1/2]$. This interval contains irrational numbers. For example, the number $x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ is irrational. Since $1 < \\sqrt{2} < 2$, we have $1/4 < \\sqrt{2}/4 < 2/4 = 1/2$, so $1+1/4 < x < 1+1/2$. This shows $x \\in (1, 1+1/2) \\subset [1, 1.5]$.\nSince $x$ is a real number, we can find a sequence of rational numbers $\\{q_k\\}$ that converges to $x$. For instance, we can take the sequence of decimal truncations of $x$. As $q_k \\to x$, for $k$ large enough, $q_k$ will lie in the same interval $(1, 1+1/2)$ as $x$. This means for $k$ large enough, $q_k \\in [1, 1.5]$ and $q_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, so $q_k \\in C$.\nWe have found a sequence $\\{q_k\\}$ of points in $C$ that converges to the point $x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$. By definition, $x$ is a limit point of $C$. However, $x$ is an irrational number, so $x \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, which implies $x \\notin C$. Since $C$ does not contain all of its limit points, $C$ is not a closed set. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.\n\nHaving eliminated A, B, D, and E, we are left with statement C. We have already shown that $C$ is an $F_{\\sigma}$ set and that it is not a closed set. Thus, statement C is the correct description of the set $C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1284238"}, {"introduction": "The Borel $\\sigma$-algebra is generated by the collection of all open sets, but what if we chose a different, seemingly simpler, starting point?
