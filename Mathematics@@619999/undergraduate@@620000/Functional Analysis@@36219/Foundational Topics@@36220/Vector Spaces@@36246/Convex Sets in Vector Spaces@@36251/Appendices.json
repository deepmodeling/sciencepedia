So, $S = \\{A \\in V \\mid \\det(A) \\neq 0\\}$.\n\nThe definition of a convex set states that for any two matrices $A \\in S$ and $B \\in S$, the convex combination $M(\\lambda) = \\lambda A + (1-\\lambda)B$ must also be in $S$ for all $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$. This means that $\\det(M(\\lambda))$ must be non-zero for all $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nTo prove that $S$ is not convex, we only need to find a single counterexample. That is, we need to find two specific invertible matrices $A$ and $B$ and a specific value of $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$ such that their convex combination $M(\\lambda)$ is not invertible (i.e., its determinant is zero).\n\nLet's choose two simple invertible matrices. A strategic choice is to pick two matrices whose sum leads to a singular matrix. Consider the identity matrix and its negative.\n\nLet $A$ be the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of $A$ is $\\det(A) = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1$.

Let's test a value of $\\lambda$ in the middle of the interval $[0, 1]$, for example, $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$, the convex combination is:\n$$M\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}A + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)B = \\frac{1}{2}A + \\frac{1}{2}B = \\frac{1}{2}(A+B)$$\n\nLet's compute $A+B$:\n$$A+B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0+0 \\\\ 0+0 & 1-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is the zero matrix.\n\nNow, we can find $M(\\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$M\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe determinant of this resulting matrix is:\n$$\\det\\left(M\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\nSince the determinant of $M(\\frac{1}{2})$ is zero, this matrix is not invertible and therefore is not in the set $S$.\n\nWe have successfully found two matrices $A$ and $B$ that are in $S$, but their convex combination for $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$ is not in $S$. This single counterexample is sufficient to prove that the set $S$ of all invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices is not a convex set. Therefore, statement B is the correct one.\n\nWe can also quickly dismiss options C and D.\nFor C: Let's try to connect two matrices with positive determinants. Let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $\\det(A)=1 > 0$ and $\\det(B)=4 > 0$. Their convex combination is $M(\\lambda) = \\lambda A + (1-\\lambda)B = \\begin{pmatrix} 3\\lambda - 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3\\lambda - 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $(3\\lambda - 2)^2$. This is zero if $\\lambda=2/3$, which is in $[0,1]$.
