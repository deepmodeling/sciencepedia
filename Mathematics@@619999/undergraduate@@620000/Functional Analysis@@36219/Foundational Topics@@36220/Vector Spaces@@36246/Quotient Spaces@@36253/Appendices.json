The zero vector in the quotient space $X/M$ is the coset $0+M$, which is simply the subspace $M$ itself.\n\nSince the norm of every element $x+M$ is 0, every element $x+M$ in the quotient space must be equal to the zero element, $M$.

Our derivation did not depend on the completeness of $X$, only on the fact that it is a normed space and $M$ is dense in it.\nE.
