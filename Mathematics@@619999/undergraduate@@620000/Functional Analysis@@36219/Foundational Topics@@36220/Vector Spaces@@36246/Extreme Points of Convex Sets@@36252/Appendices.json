Therefore $S$ is the Cartesian product of three identical $1$-simplices. A standard fact for Cartesian products of convex sets is that a point is extreme in the product if and only if each coordinate is extreme in its factor. Concretely here, a matrix in $S$ is an extreme point if and only if each of its three rows is one of the vertices $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$. We justify both directions explicitly.\n\nSufficiency: Suppose a matrix $X \\in S$ has each row equal to either $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$. Assume $X = tY + (1-t)Z$ with $Y,Z \\in S$ and $t \\in (0,1)$. Consider any row of $X$ equal to $(1,0)$. Let the corresponding rows of $Y$ and $Z$ be $y=(y_{1},y_{2})$ and $z=(z_{1},z_{2})$, with $y_{1},y_{2},z_{1},z_{2} \\geq 0$ and $y_{1}+y_{2}=1$, $z_{1}+z_{2}=1$. The equality $t y + (1-t) z = (1,0)$ yields the system\n$$\nt y_{1} + (1-t) z_{1} = 1, \\quad t y_{2} + (1-t) z_{2} = 0.\n$$\nSince $y_{2},z_{2} \\geq 0$ and $t \\in (0,1)$, the second equation implies $y_{2} = z_{2} = 0$, hence $y_{1} = z_{1} = 1$. Thus the row of $Y$ and $Z$ coincide with that of $X$. The same argument applies to any row equal to $(0,1)$, forcing the corresponding rows of $Y$ and $Z$ to be $(0,1)$. Therefore $Y=Z=X$, so $X$ is extreme.\n\nNecessity: If a matrix $X \\in S$ has a row equal to $(\\theta,1-\\theta)$ with $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, then let $E^{(1)}$ be the matrix obtained from $X$ by replacing that row with $(1,0)$ and $E^{(2)}$ the matrix obtained by replacing it with $(0,1)$, keeping all other rows identical to those of $X$.

Hence the extreme points of $S$ are precisely the matrices whose rows are each either $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$.\n\nWe now test the options:\n\n- A: $M_{A}$ has all rows $(1,0)$, hence is extreme.\n- B: $M_{B}$ has rows $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, which are not extreme.
