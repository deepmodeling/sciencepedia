Let $q$ be an arbitrary rational number. Now, consider any open interval $(a, b)$ that contains $q$. This means $a  q  b$.\n\nA fundamental property of the real number system is the density of irrational numbers. This property states that between any two distinct real numbers, there exists at least one irrational number.\n\nSince $a  b$, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are distinct real numbers. Therefore, based on the density of irrational numbers, there must exist an irrational number, let's call it $z$, such that $a  z  b$.\n\nThis means that any open interval $(a, b)$ containing the rational point $q$ must also contain at least one irrational point $z$. Since $z$ is irrational, $z \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBecause the interval $(a, b)$ contains an element $z$ that is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the interval cannot be a subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$. That is, $(a, b) \\not\\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis reasoning holds for any arbitrary rational number $q$ and any arbitrary open interval $(a, b)$ containing $q$. We can never find an open interval around a rational number that consists solely of other rational numbers.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a neighborhood of $q$. Since our choice of $q$ was arbitrary, we can conclude that $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a neighborhood of any of its points. The statement \"The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a neighborhood of at least one of its points\" is false.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This is false. The density of rational numbers in $\\mathbb{R}$ is true, but it is the density of *irrational* numbers that is key to disproving the statement. This option demonstrates a common confusion.\n\nB. This is true. As derived above, any open interval $(a,b)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ contains irrational numbers, so it can never be a subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is the correct reason for the statement being false.\n\nC. This is false. No matter how small $\\epsilon  0$ is, the interval $(q - \\epsilon, q + \\epsilon)$ will always contain both rational and irrational numbers due to the density of both sets in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nD. This is a poor justification. While the premises ( $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable) are true, this itself doesn't directly explain why the neighborhood property fails for a single point. A more precise argument would be that any open interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable and thus cannot be a subset of the countable set $\\mathbb{Q}$. The option as stated is an incomplete argument.\n\nE. This is false and represents a logical fallacy. Just because a point belongs to a superset ($\\mathbb{R}$) that has a certain property does not mean a subset ($\\mathbb{Q}$) containing that point also has that property with respect to itself.\n\nThe correct choice is B, as it accurately states that the statement is false and provides the precise reason based on the density of irrational numbers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1870867"}]}
