Find an expression for this largest value of $\\delta$ in terms of $\\epsilon$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the largest value of $\\delta > 0$ that satisfies the $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ definition of continuity for the function $h(x) = x^2 + x$ at the point $p = 1$. The condition is: for a given $\\epsilon > 0$, we must find the largest $\\delta$ such that if $|x - 1|  \\delta$, then $|h(x) - h(1)|  \\epsilon$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the function at the point $p=1$:\n$$h(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2.$$\n\nNow, we set up the inequality from the definition of continuity:\n$$|h(x) - h(1)|  \\epsilon$$\n$$|(x^2 + x) - 2|  \\epsilon$$\nWe can factor the quadratic expression inside the absolute value:\n$$|(x - 1)(x + 2)|  \\epsilon$$\n\nThis single inequality involving an absolute value is equivalent to the compound inequality:\n$$-\\epsilon  (x - 1)(x + 2)  \\epsilon$$\nThis can be split into two separate quadratic inequalities:\n1) $(x - 1)(x + 2)  \\epsilon \\implies x^2 + x - 2 - \\epsilon  0$\n2) $(x - 1)(x + 2) > -\\epsilon \\implies x^2 + x - 2 + \\epsilon > 0$\n\nLet's solve the first inequality, $x^2 + x - (2 + \\epsilon)  0$. The corresponding quadratic equation is $x^2 + x - (2 + \\epsilon) = 0$. The roots are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-(2+\\epsilon))}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8 + 4\\epsilon}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}}{2}$$\nSince the parabola $y = x^2 + x - (2 + \\epsilon)$ opens upwards, the inequality $y  0$ is satisfied between the two roots. Thus, the solution to the first inequality is:\n$$\\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}}{2}  x  \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}}{2}$$\n\nNext, we solve the second inequality, $x^2 + x + (-2 + \\epsilon) > 0$. The corresponding quadratic equation is $x^2 + x + (\\epsilon - 2) = 0$. The roots are:\n$$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(\\epsilon - 2)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4\\epsilon + 8}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4\\epsilon}}{2}$$\nThe problem statement specifies that $0  \\epsilon  9/4$, which ensures that $9 - 4\\epsilon > 0$, so the roots are real and distinct.\nSince this parabola also opens upwards, the inequality $y > 0$ is satisfied for values of $x$ outside the interval defined by the roots. Thus, the solution to the second inequality is:\n$$x  \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{9 - 4\\epsilon}}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x > \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{9 - 4\\epsilon}}{2}$$\n\nWe need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Let's combine the solution sets. The valid range for $x$ is the intersection of the solution sets of the two inequalities. Let $x_{1a} = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{9+4\\epsilon}}{2}$, $x_{1b} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{9+4\\epsilon}}{2}$, $x_{2a} = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{9-4\\epsilon}}{2}$, and $x_{2b} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{9-4\\epsilon}}{2}$. The solution for $x$ must be in $(x_{1a}, x_{1b})$ and in $(-\\infty, x_{2a}) \\cup (x_{2b}, \\infty)$. This consists of two disjoint intervals: $(x_{1a}, x_{2a}) \\cup (x_{2b}, x_{1b})$.\n\nWe are interested in the continuity at $p=1$. We must identify which of these two intervals contains the point $1$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, $x_{2b} \\to \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{9}}{2} = 1$ and $x_{1b} \\to \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{9}}{2}=1$. Therefore, for small positive $\\epsilon$, the point $p=1$ is contained in the interval $(x_{2b}, x_{1b})$. So, the set of all $x$ satisfying the condition $|h(x)-h(1)|  \\epsilon$ is the open interval:\n$$I = \\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{9 - 4\\epsilon}}{2}, \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the largest $\\delta > 0$ such that the interval $(1-\\delta, 1+\\delta)$ is contained within the interval $I$.

Notice that $f(0) = g(0) = 0$. Let's compare their derivatives:\n$$f'(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{9 - 4\\epsilon}}(-4)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{9 - 4\\epsilon}}$$\n$$g'(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}}(4)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}}$$\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $9 - 4\\epsilon  9 + 4\\epsilon$, which implies $\\sqrt{9 - 4\\epsilon}  \\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}$. Therefore, $f'(\\epsilon) > g'(\\epsilon)$ for all $\\epsilon$ in the given range. Since both functions are 0 at $\\epsilon=0$ and $f(\\epsilon)$ grows faster than $g(\\epsilon)$, it must be that $f(\\epsilon) > g(\\epsilon)$ for $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nThus, the minimum of the two expressions is $\\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 4\\epsilon}}{2}$.
