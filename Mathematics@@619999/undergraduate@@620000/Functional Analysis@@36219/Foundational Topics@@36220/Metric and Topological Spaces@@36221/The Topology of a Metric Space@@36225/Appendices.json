A map $f$ is continuous at a point $p$ if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any point $x$ in the domain, if the distance from $x$ to $p$ in the domain's metric is less than $\\delta$, then the distance from $f(x)$ to $f(p)$ in the codomain's metric is less than $\\epsilon$.\n\nIn our case, the domain space is $(\\mathbb{R}^2, d_2)$ and the codomain space is $(\\mathbb{R}^2, d_r)$. Since $f$ is the identity map ($f(x)=x$ and $f(p)=p$), the condition for continuity at $p$ becomes:\nFor every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_2(x, p) < \\delta$, then $d_r(x, p) < \\epsilon$.\n\nWe analyze two cases for the point $p$.\n\n**Case 1: The point $p$ is the origin, $p = O = (0,0)$.**\nWe need to check if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_2(x, O) < \\delta$, then $d_r(x, O) < \\epsilon$.\nAccording to the definition of the French railway metric $d_r$, if the points $x$, $O$, and $O$ are collinear (which is always true), then $d_r(x, O) = d_2(x, O)$.\nSo, the condition for continuity at the origin simplifies to:\nFor every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_2(x, O) < \\delta$, then $d_2(x, O) < \\epsilon$.\nWe can simply choose $\\delta = \\epsilon$. If $d_2(x, O) < \\delta$, then $d_2(x, O) < \\epsilon$ is satisfied.\nTherefore, the map $f$ is continuous at the origin $O$.\n\n**Case 2: The point $p$ is not the origin, $p \\neq O$.**\nWe need to check if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_2(x, p) < \\delta$, then $d_r(x, p) < \\epsilon$.\nSince $p \\neq O$, the distance from $p$ to the origin is strictly positive: $d_2(p, O) > 0$.\nLet's consider the value of $d_r(x, p)$ for points $x$ that are close to $p$ in the Euclidean metric. No matter how small we choose $\\delta$, the open ball $B_{d_2}(p, \\delta) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : d_2(x, p) < \\delta\\}$ contains points $x$ that are not on the line passing through $O$ and $p$.\nFor any such point $x$, the points $x, p, O$ are not collinear. By the definition of the French railway metric, the distance is:\n$$d_r(x, p) = d_2(x, O) + d_2(p, O)$$\nLet's analyze this value as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $p$ (i.e., as $\\delta \\to 0$). As $x \\to p$ in the Euclidean metric, by the triangle inequality for $d_2$, we have $|d_2(x, O) - d_2(p, O)| \\le d_2(x, p)$. Thus, $d_2(x, O) \\to d_2(p, O)$.\nSo for an $x$ not on the line through $O$ and $p$, as $x \\to p$:\n$$\\lim_{x \\to p} d_r(x, p) = \\lim_{x \\to p} (d_2(x, O) + d_2(p, O)) = d_2(p, O) + d_2(p, O) = 2 d_2(p, O)$$\nTo show discontinuity, we need to find a single $\\epsilon > 0$ for which no $\\delta > 0$ works.\nLet's choose $\\epsilon = d_2(p, O)$. Since $p \\neq O$, this $\\epsilon$ is a positive number.\nFor any $\\delta > 0$, we can choose a point $x$ in the ball $B_{d_2}(p, \\delta)$ that does not lie on the line passing through $O$ and $p$. For such a point $x$, we have:\n$$d_r(x, p) = d_2(x, O) + d_2(p, O) > d_2(p, O) = \\epsilon$$\n(The inequality is strict because $x \\neq O$, so $d_2(x, O) > 0$).\nThis means that for our chosen $\\epsilon$, we can always find an $x$ with $d_2(x, p) < \\delta$ but $d_r(x, p) \\ge \\epsilon$. The condition for continuity is not met.\nTherefore, the map $f$ is not continuous at any point $p \\neq O$.\n\nCombining both cases, the identity map $f$ is continuous only at the origin $O=(0,0)$.
