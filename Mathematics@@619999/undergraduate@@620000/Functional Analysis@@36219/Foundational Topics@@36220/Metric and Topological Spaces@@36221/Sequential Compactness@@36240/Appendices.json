The problem states that $S$ is relatively compact if and only if it satisfies both of these conditions.\n\nFirst, let's check for uniform boundedness.\nA set $S$ is uniformly bounded if there is a single constant $M$ that bounds the norm of every element in $S$. Let $x = (x_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ be an arbitrary element of $S$. By the definition of $S$, we have $\\sup_{n \\ge 1} n|x_n| \\le 1$.

This can be rewritten as $|x_n| \\le \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nThe norm of $x$ is given by $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{n \\ge 1} |x_n|$. Using the inequality we just derived:\n$$ \\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{n \\ge 1} |x_n| \\le \\sup_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{1}{n} $$\nThe sequence $(\\frac{1}{n})_{n \\ge 1}$ is a decreasing sequence starting at $1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\dots$. Its supremum is its first term, which is $1$.\nTherefore, for any $x \\in S$, we have $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\le 1$.\nThis shows that the set $S$ is uniformly bounded with the constant $M=1$. The first condition for relative compactness is satisfied. Based on this finding, we can eliminate options B and C.\n\nNext, let's check for uniform convergence to zero.\nWe need to determine if for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find an integer $N$ (which does not depend on the specific choice of $x \\in S$) such that for all $x \\in S$ and for all integers $n \\ge N$, it holds that $|x_n|  \\epsilon$.\n\nLet's take an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$. For any $x \\in S$, we know that $|x_n| \\le \\frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nWe want to find an $N$ such that for all $n \\ge N$, $|x_n|  \\epsilon$. Since $|x_n| \\le \\frac{1}{n}$, if we can ensure that $\\frac{1}{n}  \\epsilon$, then it will automatically follow that $|x_n|  \\epsilon$.\nThe inequality $\\frac{1}{n}  \\epsilon$ is equivalent to $n > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\nBy the Archimedean property of the real numbers, for any positive real number $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, there exists an integer larger than it. Let's choose $N$ to be any integer such that $N > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$. A common explicit choice is $N = \\lfloor \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\rfloor + 1$. This choice of $N$ depends only on $\\epsilon$.\n\nNow, let's verify this choice of $N$. For any integer $n \\ge N$, we have $n > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, which implies $\\frac{1}{n}  \\epsilon$.\nTherefore, for any $x \\in S$ and any $n \\ge N$, we have:\n$$ |x_n| \\le \\frac{1}{n}  \\epsilon $$\nThis confirms that the condition for uniform convergence to zero is met. The choice of $N$ is independent of the particular sequence $x$ chosen from $S$.\n\nSince the set $S$ is both uniformly bounded and uniformly convergent to zero, the theorem quoted in the problem statement implies that $S$ is relatively compact in $(c_0, \\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty})$. This conclusion matches option D. Option A is incorrect because $S$ is uniformly convergent to zero. Option E is incorrect because relative compactness does not require the set itself to be closed.
