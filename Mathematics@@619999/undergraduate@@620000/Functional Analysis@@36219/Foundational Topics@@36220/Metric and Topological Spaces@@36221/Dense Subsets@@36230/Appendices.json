A set $\\mathcal{A}$ is dense in a subspace $V$ (with respect to the topology of the larger space, here $C[0,1]$) if and only if the closure of $\\mathcal{A}$, denoted $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$, contains $V$. That is, $V \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$. We will analyze the closure of each approximating set of polynomials and then check the inclusion condition for each option.\n\nFirst, let's determine the closures of the relevant sets of polynomials.\n\n1.  **Closure of $\\mathcal{P}$**: The classic Stone-Weierstrass theorem states that if a subalgebra of $C(X, \\mathbb{R})$ (for a compact Hausdorff space $X$) separates points and contains the constant functions, it is dense in $C(X, \\mathbb{R})$. Here $X=[0,1]$. The set of all polynomials $\\mathcal{P}$ forms a subalgebra of $C[0,1]$, contains constant functions (e.g., $p(x)=1$), and separates points (e.g., $p(x)=x$ separates any two distinct points). Therefore, $\\mathcal{P}$ is dense in $C[0,1]$, which means $\\overline{\\mathcal{P}} = C[0,1]$.\n\n2.  **Closure of $\\mathcal{P}_0$**: The set $\\mathcal{P}_0 = \\{p \\in \\mathcal{P} : p(0)=0\\}$ is a subalgebra of $C[0,1]$. It separates points (e.g., $p(x)=x \\in \\mathcal{P}_0$ separates distinct points). The common set of zeros for all functions in $\\mathcal{P}_0$ is the single point $\\{0\\}$. A variation of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem states that the closure of such a subalgebra is the set of all continuous functions that vanish on this common set of zeros. Thus, $\\overline{\\mathcal{P}_0} = \\{f \\in C[0,1] : f(0)=0\\}$, which is precisely the subspace $V_0$.\n\n3.  **Closure of $\\mathcal{A}_* = \\{p \\in \\mathcal{P} : p(0)=p(1)\\}$**: Let $V_* = \\{f \\in C[0,1] : f(0)=f(1)\\}$. We want to find $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}_*}$. Let $f \\in V_*$ and $\\epsilon > 0$. By the main Stone-Weierstrass theorem, there exists a polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$ such that $\\|f - p\\|_{\\infty} < \\epsilon/2$. Let $\\delta = p(1) - p(0)$. We construct a new polynomial $q(x) = p(x) - \\delta x$.\n    We check if $q \\in \\mathcal{A}_*$:\n    $q(0) = p(0) - \\delta(0) = p(0)$.\n    $q(1) = p(1) - \\delta(1) = p(1) - (p(1)-p(0)) = p(0)$.\n    Since $q(0)=q(1)$, $q$ is in $\\mathcal{A}_*$.\n    Now we check the approximation error:\n    $\\|f - q\\|_{\\infty} = \\|f - (p - \\delta x)\\|_{\\infty} = \\|(f-p) + \\delta x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\|f-p\\|_{\\infty} + \\|\\delta x\\|_{\\infty}$.\n    We know $\\|f-p\\|_{\\infty} < \\epsilon/2$ and $\\|\\delta x\\|_{\\infty} = |\\delta| \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |x| = |\\delta|$.\n    The value of $\\delta$ can be bounded:\n    $|\\delta| = |p(1) - p(0)| = |(p(1) - f(1)) - (p(0) - f(0))|$ since $f(1)=f(0)$.\n    $|\\delta| \\leq |p(1) - f(1)| + |p(0) - f(0)| \\leq \\|p-f\\|_{\\infty} + \\|p-f\\|_{\\infty} < \\epsilon/2 + \\epsilon/2 = \\epsilon$.\n    So, $\\|f - q\\|_{\\infty} < \\epsilon/2 + \\epsilon = \\frac{3}{2}\\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon$ is arbitrary, we can make the approximation arbitrarily good. This shows that $\\mathcal{A}_*$ is dense in $V_*$, so $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}_*} = V_*$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The set $\\mathcal{P}_0$ is dense in the subspace $V_1$.**\nThis requires $V_1 \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathcal{P}_0}$. We found $\\overline{\\mathcal{P}_0} = V_0$. The condition is $V_1 \\subseteq V_0$. This is false. For example, the function $f(x)=1-x$ is in $V_1$ because $f(1)=0$, but it is not in $V_0$ because $f(0)=1 \\neq 0$. So, **A is false**.\n\n**B. The set $\\mathcal{P}_0$ is dense in the subspace $V_{01}$.**\nThis requires $V_{01} \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathcal{P}_0} = V_0$. If a function $f$ is in $V_{01}$, then $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=0$. By definition, any such function satisfies $f(0)=0$, so it must be in $V_0$. The inclusion $V_{01} \\subseteq V_0$ is true. Thus, **B is true**.\n\n**C. The set $\\mathcal{P}$ is dense in the subspace $I$.**\nThis requires $I \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathcal{P}}$. We found $\\overline{\\mathcal{P}} = C[0,1]$. The subspace $I$ is a set of continuous functions on $[0,1]$, so by definition, $I \\subseteq C[0,1]$. The inclusion is true. Thus, **C is true**.\n\n**D. The set $\\{p \\in \\mathcal{P} : p(0)=p(1)\\}$ is dense in the subspace $\\{f \\in C[0,1] : f(0)=f(1)\\}$.**\nThis requires $V_* \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathcal{A}_*}$, where these sets are as defined in our preliminary analysis. We showed that $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}_*} = V_*$. The inclusion $V_* \\subseteq V_*$ is trivially true. Thus, **D is true**.\n\n**E. The set $\\mathcal{P}_0$ is dense in the subspace $I$.**\nThis requires $I \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathcal{P}_0} = V_0$. This means that any continuous function with a zero integral must also be zero at the origin. This is false. Consider the function $f(x) = x - 1/2$. We have $\\int_0^1 (x-1/2)dx = [\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x}{2}]_0^1 = 0$, so $f \\in I$. However, $f(0)=-1/2 \\neq 0$, so $f \\notin V_0$. Thus, **E is false**.\n\nThe correct statements are B, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCD}$$", "id": "1857732"}]}
