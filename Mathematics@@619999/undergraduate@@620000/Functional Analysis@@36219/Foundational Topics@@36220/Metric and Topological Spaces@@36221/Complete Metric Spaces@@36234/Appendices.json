This exercise challenges you to apply the formal definition of a complete metric space to the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, within a specific interval.

Let $S$ be the subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ containing all rational numbers within the closed interval $[0, 5]$. Formally, this set is defined as $S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 5\\}$. We consider $S$ as a metric space with the metric $d$ inherited from $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nRecall that a metric space is defined as 'complete' if every Cauchy sequence of points within that space converges to a limit that is also an element of the space.\n\nBased on this definition, which of the following statements correctly assesses the completeness of the metric space $(S, d)$?\n\nA. Yes, the space $(S, d)$ is complete because $S$ is a subset of a bounded interval $[0, 5]$ and is therefore a bounded set.\n\nB. Yes, the space $(S, d)$ is complete because the interval $[0, 5]$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nC. No, the space $(S, d)$ is not complete because there exists at least one Cauchy sequence in $S$ whose limit is not in $S$.\n\nD. No, the space $(S, d)$ is not complete because $S$ contains its endpoints 0 and 5, making it not an open set.", "solution": "To determine if the metric space $(S, d)$, where $S = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 5]$, is complete, we must check if every Cauchy sequence in $S$ converges to a limit that is also in $S$. If we can find a single counterexample—a Cauchy sequence of points in $S$ whose limit is not in $S$—then the space is not complete.\n\nLet's choose an irrational number that lies within the interval $[0, 5]$. A classic example is the square root of 2, $\\sqrt{2}$. We know that $1^2 = 1$ and $2^2 = 4$, which implies that $1 < \\sqrt{2} < 2$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of the interval $[0, 5]$. However, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number, so by definition, $\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. Consequently, $\\sqrt{2}$ is not an element of our set $S = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 5]$.\n\nNow, we will construct a sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ of points in $S$ that converges to $\\sqrt{2}$. Let the sequence be the successive decimal approximations of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n$x_1 = 1.4$\n$x_2 = 1.41$\n$x_3 = 1.414$\n$x_4 = 1.4142$\n...and so on.\n\nLet's verify that this sequence $(x_n)$ has the required properties.\n1. Each term $x_n$ is a terminating decimal. Any terminating decimal can be written as a fraction with a power of 10 in the denominator, so each $x_n$ is a rational number. For example, $x_3 = 1.414 = \\frac{1414}{1000}$.\n2. Each term $x_n$ is in the interval $[0, 5]$. As we saw, $1 < \\sqrt{2} < 2$, and the sequence of decimal approximations monotonically increases towards $\\sqrt{2}$, so all terms will be between 1 and 2. Thus, all $x_n$ are in $[0, 5]$.\n3. Combining these two facts, every term $x_n$ is a rational number in $[0, 5]$, which means $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $S$.\n\nNext, we must verify that $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence. In the larger space $\\mathbb{R}$, this sequence converges to the limit $L = \\sqrt{2}$. A fundamental theorem of metric spaces states that any convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$. Since the metric $d$ on $S$ is the same as the metric on $\\mathbb{R}$, the condition for being a Cauchy sequence is identical. Thus, $(x_n)$ is also a Cauchy sequence in $S$.\n\nFinally, we examine the limit of this sequence. The limit is $L = \\sqrt{2}$. As established earlier, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number and is therefore not an element of $S$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a sequence $(x_n)$ of points in $S$ which is a Cauchy sequence, but its limit, $\\sqrt{2}$, does not belong to $S$. By the definition of completeness, the metric space $(S, d)$ is not complete.\n\nThis directly corresponds to option C. Let's analyze the other options:\n- Option A is incorrect. While $S$ is indeed bounded, boundedness alone is not sufficient for completeness. The Heine-Borel theorem states that a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact (and thus complete) if and only if it is closed and bounded. $S$ is not a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$ because it does not contain all of its limit points (e.g., $\\sqrt{2}$).\n- Option B is incorrect. The fact that the interval $[0, 5]$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ means any convergent sequence of points from $[0, 5]$ will have its limit in $[0, 5]$. However, our sequence of *rational* points has an *irrational* limit, which is not in our subspace $S$. The property of the containing interval does not guarantee completeness for the subspace of rationals.\n- Option D is incorrect. Whether a set is open or closed is relevant to completeness (a subspace of a complete space is complete iff it is closed), but being \"not open\" is not the reason for being \"not complete\". For example, $[0, 1]$ as a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}$ is not open, but it is complete.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1850254"}, {"introduction": "The definition of a Cauchy sequence is precise and sometimes counter-intuitive.
