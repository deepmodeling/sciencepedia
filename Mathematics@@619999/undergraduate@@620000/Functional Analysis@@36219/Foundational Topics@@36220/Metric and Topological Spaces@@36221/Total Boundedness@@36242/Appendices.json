The space $C([0,1])$ with the supremum norm is a complete metric space (a Banach space). In a complete metric space, a set is totally bounded if and only if it is relatively compact (i.e., its closure is compact).\n\nThe Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a subset of $C(K)$ (where $K$ is a compact space like $[0,1]$) to be relatively compact. The theorem states that a set $F \\subseteq C(K)$ is relatively compact if and only if it is (i) uniformly bounded and (ii) equicontinuous. We will check if the set $A$ satisfies these two conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Uniform Boundedness**\nA set of functions $F$ is uniformly bounded if there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\le M$ for all $f \\in F$.\nThe definition of the set $A$ explicitly includes the condition that for any function $f \\in A$, we must have $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\le 1$.\nThis means we can choose $M=1$. Since every function in $A$ is bounded by the same constant, the set $A$ is uniformly bounded. This also implies that $A$ is a bounded subset of $C([0,1])$. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Equicontinuity**\nA family of functions $F$ is equicontinuous if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $f \\in F$ and for all $x, y$ in the domain, if $|x-y| < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \\epsilon$. The crucial part is that $\\delta$ depends only on $\\epsilon$ and not on the specific function $f$ or the points $x,y$.\n\nLet $f$ be an arbitrary function in our set $A$. For any two points $x, y \\in [0,1]$, an immediate consequence of the Mean Value Theorem is that there exists a point $c$ in the open interval between $x$ and $y$ such that:\n$$ f(x) - f(y) = f'(c)(x-y) $$\nTaking the absolute value of both sides gives:\n$$ |f(x) - f(y)| = |f'(c)| |x-y| $$\nBy the definition of the set $A$, we know that $\\|f'\\|_{\\infty} \\le 1$. This means that $|f'(z)| \\le 1$ for all $z \\in [0,1]$. In particular, this holds for the point $c$, so $|f'(c)| \\le 1$.\nSubstituting this back into our equation, we obtain the inequality:\n$$ |f(x) - f(y)| \\le 1 \\cdot |x-y| = |x-y| $$\nThis inequality is valid for any function $f \\in A$ and any pair of points $x, y \\in [0,1]$.\n\nNow, we can formally show equicontinuity. Let an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. We need to find a suitable $\\delta > 0$. Based on the inequality above, let's choose $\\delta = \\epsilon$.\nThen, for any $f \\in A$ and any $x, y \\in [0,1]$ such that $|x-y| < \\delta$, we have:\n$$ |f(x) - f(y)| \\le |x-y| < \\delta = \\epsilon $$\nSince we found a $\\delta$ that depends only on $\\epsilon$ and works for all functions in $A$, the set $A$ is an equicontinuous family of functions. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\nSince the set $A$ is both uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, by the Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem, $A$ is a relatively compact subset of $C([0,1])$. As stated earlier, in a complete metric space, relative compactness is equivalent to total boundedness.\nTherefore, the set $A$ is totally bounded in $(C([0,1]), \\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty})$.\n\nThis confirms that statement A is correct. Let's analyze the other options.\nOption B is incorrect. A set does not need to be closed to be totally bounded. For instance, the open interval $(0, 1)$ is totally bounded in $\\mathbb{R}$ but not closed. While it's true that $A$ is not a closed set in $C([0,1])$, this is not the reason for failing to be totally bounded (as it is, in fact, totally bounded).\nOption E is incorrect because the given conditions are sufficient to determine total boundedness using the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem.
