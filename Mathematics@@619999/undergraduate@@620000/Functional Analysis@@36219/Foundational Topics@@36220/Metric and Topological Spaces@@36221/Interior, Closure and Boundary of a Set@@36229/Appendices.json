We will analyze each component separately based on their topological definitions.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions in the context of $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n- The **interior** of $S$, denoted $S^\\circ$, is the set of all points $p \\in S$ for which there exists an open ball centered at $p$ that is completely contained within $S$.\n- The **closure** of $S$, denoted $\\bar{S}$, is the set of all points $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that every open ball centered at $p$ contains at least one point of $S$.\n- The **boundary** of $S$, denoted $\\partial S$, is the set of all points $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that every open ball centered at $p$ contains at least one point from $S$ and at least one point from the complement of $S$, $S^c = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus S$. A useful relation is $\\partial S = \\bar{S} \\setminus S^\\circ$.\n\nWe will use the fundamental properties of real numbers: both the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the set of irrational numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that any non-empty open interval $(a, b)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ contains both rational and irrational numbers.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the interior, $S^\\circ$.**\nLet $p = (x, y)$ be an arbitrary point in $S$. By the definition of $S$, both $x$ and $y$ are rational numbers. For $p$ to be an interior point of $S$, there must exist a radius $r > 0$ such that the open ball $B(p, r)$ is entirely contained in $S$. An open ball is defined as $B(p, r) = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d(p, q) < r \\}$, where $d$ is the Euclidean distance.\n\nConsider any open ball $B(p, r)$ with $r > 0$. Since the irrational numbers are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the open interval $(x, x+r)$ contains an irrational number, let's call it $x'$. Now consider the point $p' = (x', y)$. The distance from $p$ to $p'$ is $d(p, p') = \\sqrt{(x'-x)^2 + (y-y)^2} = |x'-x|$. Since $x < x' < x+r$, we have $0 < |x'-x| < r$, which means $p' \\in B(p, r)$.\n\nHowever, since the first coordinate $x'$ of $p'$ is irrational, the point $p'$ is not in $S = \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$. This shows that any open ball centered at any point $p \\in S$ contains points that are not in $S$. Therefore, no point of $S$ is an interior point. The interior of $S$ is the empty set.\n$$S^\\circ = \\emptyset$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the closure, $\\bar{S}$.**\nLet $p = (x, y)$ be an arbitrary point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The coordinates $x$ and $y$ can be any real numbers. For $p$ to be in the closure of $S$, every open ball $B(p, r)$ with $r > 0$ must contain at least one point from $S$.\n\nWe use the fact that the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. For any given radius $r > 0$, consider the open intervals $(x - \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}, x + \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}})$ and $(y - \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}, y + \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}})$. Due to the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$, there exists a rational number $x'$ in the first interval and a rational number $y'$ in the second interval.\nLet $p' = (x', y')$. Since both coordinates are rational, $p' \\in S$.\n\nNow we check if $p'$ lies within the ball $B(p, r)$. The distance is:\n$$d(p, p') = \\sqrt{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2}$$\nSince $|x-x'| < \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $|y-y'| < \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we have:\n$$d(p, p') < \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{r^2}{2} + \\frac{r^2}{2}} = \\sqrt{r^2} = r$$\nSo, $p' \\in B(p, r)$. Since our choice of $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ was arbitrary, this means that every open ball around any point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ contains a point from $S$. Thus, every point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is in the closure of $S$.\n$$\\bar{S} = \\mathbb{R}^2$$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the boundary, $\\partial S$.**\nWe can use the relationship $\\partial S = \\bar{S} \\setminus S^\\circ$.\nSubstituting our results from the previous steps:\n$$\\partial S = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\emptyset = \\mathbb{R}^2$$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the definition of a boundary point. A point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a boundary point if every open ball $B(p, r)$ contains a point from $S$ and a point from its complement $S^c = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus (\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nIn Step 2, we already proved that for any $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, every open ball $B(p, r)$ contains a point from $S$.\nNow we need to show that it also contains a point from $S^c$. The set $S^c$ consists of points $(x, y)$ where at least one coordinate is irrational.\nLet $p = (x, y)$ be any point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and consider any open ball $B(p, r)$ with $r > 0$. Since the irrational numbers are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we can find an irrational number $x'$ in the interval $(x - r, x + r)$. The point $p' = (x', y)$ has a distance from $p$ of $d(p, p') = |x'-x| < r$, so $p' \\in B(p, r)$. As $x'$ is irrational, $p' \\in S^c$.\nSo, every open ball around any point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ contains points from both $S$ and $S^c$. This means every point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a boundary point of $S$.\n$$\\partial S = \\mathbb{R}^2$$\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have found $S^\\circ = \\emptyset$, $\\bar{S} = \\mathbb{R}^2$, and $\\partial S = \\mathbb{R}^2$.
