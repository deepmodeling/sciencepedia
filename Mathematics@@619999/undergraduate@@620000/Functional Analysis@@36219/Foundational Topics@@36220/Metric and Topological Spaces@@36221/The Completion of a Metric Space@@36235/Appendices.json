This exercise provides a concrete and intuitive foundation for understanding what it means for a space to be incomplete and how we can \"fill in the gaps\" to make it complete, linking the abstract concept of completion to the more visual idea of a set's closure [@problem_id:1289311].", "problem": "Consider the set of real numbers $S$ defined as $S = \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots \\}$ represents the set of positive integers.

The completion of a metric subspace $X$ of a complete metric space $M$ is isometric to the closure of $X$ in $M$, because closed subsets of complete metric spaces are complete, and the closure is the smallest closed (hence complete) set containing $X$ in which $X$ is dense.\n\nThus, to find the completion of $(S,d)$, it suffices to compute the closure of $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we show that $0$ is a limit point of $S$. Let $\\varepsilon0$ be arbitrary. Choose $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $N\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$. Then $x=\\frac{1}{N}\\in S$ and satisfies $|x-0|=\\frac{1}{N}\\varepsilon$.

Thus $\\overline{S}$ is the completion of $(S,d)$.\n\nFor completeness, we note that $(S,d)$ is not complete: the sequence $x_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}$ is Cauchy, since for $m,n$ large,\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{n}-\\frac{1}{m}\\right|\\leq \\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{m},\n$$\nbut $x_{n}\\to 0\\notin S$.
