Equivalently, a set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.\n\nFor $S_{1}=\\{-3,0,e,5\\}$, note that for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the complement of the singleton is\n$$\n\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{a\\} = (-\\infty,a) \\cup (a,\\infty),\n$$\nwhich is open as a union of open intervals. Hence each singleton $\\{a\\}$ is closed. A finite union of closed sets is closed, so $S_{1}$, being the finite union of four singletons, is closed.\n\nFor $S_{2}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0x1\\}=(0,1)$, this is an open interval and thus open. To test for closedness, observe that $0$ is a limit point of $(0,1)$ but $0 \\notin (0,1)$: for any $\\varepsilon0$, choose $x=\\varepsilon/2$; if $\\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small (e.g. $\\varepsilon  2$), then $0x1$ and $|x-0|\\varepsilon$. Since $(0,1)$ does not contain the limit point $0$, it is not closed.\n\nFor $S_{3}=\\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n \\ge 1\\}$, consider the point $0$. For any $\\varepsilon0$, choose $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $N  \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$; then for any $n \\ge N$ we have $\\frac{1}{n}  \\varepsilon$ and $\\frac{1}{n} \\in S_{3}$ with $\\frac{1}{n} \\ne 0$. Thus every neighborhood of $0$ contains points of $S_{3}$ different from $0$, so $0$ is a limit point of $S_{3}$.

By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, for every $\\varepsilon0$ there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $|q-x|\\varepsilon$.

Since there exist irrational limit points not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not closed.\n\nFor $S_{5}=[0,1)$, consider the point $1$. For any $\\varepsilon0$, the point $1-\\varepsilon/2$ (for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$) satisfies $0 \\le 1-\\varepsilon/2  1$ and $|1-(1-\\varepsilon/2)|=\\varepsilon/2\\varepsilon$, so every neighborhood of $1$ contains points of $[0,1)$.
