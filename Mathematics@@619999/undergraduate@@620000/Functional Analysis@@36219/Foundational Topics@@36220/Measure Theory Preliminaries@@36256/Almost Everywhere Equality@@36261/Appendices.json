The proposition is false. If $f = g$ a.e. and $f$ is continuously differentiable, $f$ must be continuous. This implies $g$ is continuous almost everywhere. By a property of real functions, any function that is continuous almost everywhere must be differentiable on a set of positive measure, contradicting that $g$ is nowhere differentiable.\n\nB. The proposition is false. If $f \\in C^1([0,1])$ and $f=g$ a.e., a fundamental theorem of calculus for Lebesgue integrals implies that $g$ must be absolutely continuous. Every absolutely continuous function is differentiable almost everywhere. This contradicts the condition that $g$ is nowhere differentiable.\n\nC. The proposition is true. One can construct such a function $g$ by starting with any $C^1$ function $f$ and adding a second function which is non-zero only on a dense set of measure zero (like the rationals), but whose values are chosen to disrupt the limit defining the derivative at every point in the domain.\n\nD. The proposition is true, but only under the specific condition that the continuously differentiable function $f$ is a constant function, i.e., $f(x)=c$ for some constant $c$. It is not possible for non-constant $f$.\n\nE. The proposition is true. The Weierstrass function is an example of a function that is continuous everywhere but nowhere differentiable, and any continuous function can be approximated by a $C^1$ function, so such a $g$ must exist.", "solution": "We assess the proposition by explicit construction and rigorous verification.\n\nLet $f\\in C^{1}([0,1])$ be arbitrary.
