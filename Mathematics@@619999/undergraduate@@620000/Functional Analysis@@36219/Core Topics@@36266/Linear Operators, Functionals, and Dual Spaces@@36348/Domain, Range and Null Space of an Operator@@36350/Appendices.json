Acting on a space of functions like $C[0,1]$, these operators simply scale a function $f(x)$ at each point by a given multiplier function. This exercise [@problem_id:1858522] challenges you to explore how the properties of this multiplier directly determine the null space and range of the operator, revealing a fundamental link between the operator's structure and its core subspaces.", "problem": "Consider the linear operator $T$ acting on the space $C[0, 1]$ of continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[0, 1]$. The operator is defined by the multiplication:\n$$(Tf)(x) = (4x - 4x^2)f(x)$$\nfor any function $f \\in C[0, 1]$.\n\nLet $\\ker(T)$ denote the null space (or kernel) of $T$, and let $\\text{ran}(T)$ denote the range of $T$.

The operator $T$ is surjective (i.e., $\\text{ran}(T) = C[0,1]$).", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the null space (kernel) and the range of the given operator $T$. The operator is defined on the space of continuous functions $C[0, 1]$ as $(Tf)(x) = (4x - 4x^2)f(x)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the null space, $\\ker(T)$. A function $f \\in C[0, 1]$ belongs to the null space if and only if $(Tf)(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nThis gives the equation:\n$$(4x - 4x^2)f(x) = 0$$\nWe can factor the multiplier polynomial as $4x(1 - x)$. The equation is:\n$$4x(1 - x)f(x) = 0$$\nThe term $4x(1 - x)$ is zero only when $x=0$ or $x=1$. For any $x$ in the open interval $(0, 1)$, the multiplier $4x(1-x)$ is non-zero. For the entire expression to be zero for all $x \\in [0,1]$, we must have $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in (0, 1)$.\nSince $f$ is an element of $C[0,1]$, it must be continuous on the entire closed interval $[0,1]$. The continuity at the endpoints implies that the value of the function must equal the limit as we approach the endpoint from within the interval.\nAt $x=0$, we have $f(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x)$. Since $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$, this limit is $0$. So, $f(0)=0$.\nAt $x=1$, we have $f(1) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x)$. Since $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$, this limit is also $0$. So, $f(1)=0$.\nTherefore, $f(x)$ must be the zero function, i.e., $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\nThis means the null space contains only the zero function: $\\ker(T) = \\{0\\}$. The null space is trivial. This eliminates options A and B.\n\nNext, we analyze the range, $\\text{ran}(T)$. A function $h \\in C[0, 1]$ is in the range of $T$ if there exists a function $f \\in C[0, 1]$ such that $h(x) = (Tf)(x)$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n$$h(x) = (4x - 4x^2)f(x) = 4x(1-x)f(x)$$\nA necessary condition for $h$ to be in the range is found by evaluating this equation at the points where the multiplier $4x(1-x)$ is zero.\nAt $x=0$, we must have $h(0) = 4(0)(1-0)f(0) = 0$.\nAt $x=1$, we must have $h(1) = 4(1)(1-1)f(1) = 0$.\nSo, any function in the range of $T$ must be zero at both $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nThis immediately shows that $T$ is not surjective, since there are many functions in $C[0,1]$ that do not satisfy this condition (e.g., the constant function $h(x)=1$). Thus, option E is false.\n\nNow we must determine if the specific function $g(x) = x - x^3$ is in the range of $T$.\nFirst, we check if $g(x)$ satisfies the necessary conditions:\n$g(0) = 0 - 0^3 = 0$.\n$g(1) = 1 - 1^3 = 0$.\nThe conditions are satisfied. Now we must determine if there exists a *continuous* function $f(x)$ on $[0,1]$ such that $g(x) = 4x(1-x)f(x)$.\nFor $x \\in (0, 1)$, we can solve for $f(x)$:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{4x(1 - x)} = \\frac{x - x^3}{4x(1 - x)}$$\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring the numerator: $x - x^3 = x(1-x^2) = x(1-x)(1+x)$.\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x(1-x)(1+x)}{4x(1-x)}$$\nFor $x \\in (0, 1)$, we can cancel the non-zero terms $x$ and $(1-x)$:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{1+x}{4}$$\nThis expression defines a function on $(0, 1)$. For $f$ to be in $C[0, 1]$, we must be able to define $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ to make the function continuous on the closed interval. This is possible if the limits of $f(x)$ as $x \\to 0^+$ and $x \\to 1^-$ exist.\nLet's compute these limits:\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1+x}{4} = \\frac{1+0}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} \\frac{1+x}{4} = \\frac{1+1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSince these limits exist, we can define a function $f(x) = \\frac{1+x}{4}$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. This function is a simple linear polynomial, so it is continuous on $[0, 1]$. By construction, with this $f(x)$, we have $(Tf)(x) = 4x(1-x)\\frac{1+x}{4} = x(1-x)(1+x) = x-x^3 = g(x)$.\nSince we found a function $f \\in C[0,1]$ such that $Tf = g$, we conclude that $g(x)$ is in the range of $T$.\n\nCombining our findings: $\\ker(T)$ is trivial, and $g(x) \\in \\text{ran}(T)$.
