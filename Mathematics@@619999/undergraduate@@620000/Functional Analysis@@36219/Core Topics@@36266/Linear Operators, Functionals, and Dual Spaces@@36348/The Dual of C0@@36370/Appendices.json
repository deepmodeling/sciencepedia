The functional is defined by its action on a set of vectors $\\{e_n - e_{n+1}\\}_{n \\ge 1}$.\n\nFirst, we recall the Riesz representation theorem for the dual space of $c_0$. The dual space $(c_0)'$ is isometrically isomorphic to the space $\\ell^1$ of absolutely summable real sequences. This means that for any bounded linear functional $f: c_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique sequence $y = (y_n)_{n \\ge 1} \\in \\ell^1$ such that for any $x = (x_n)_{n \\ge 1} \\in c_0$, the action of $f$ is given by:\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty x_n y_n$$\nFurthermore, the norm of the functional is $\\|f\\| = \\|y\\|_1 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |y_n|$.\n\nThe problem states that $f(e_n - e_{n+1}) = (1/3)^n$ for all $n \\ge 1$. Using the linearity of $f$ and the representation above, we can express the action of $f$ on the basis vectors $e_k$. The action of $f$ on $e_k$ is:\n$$f(e_k) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (e_k)_n y_n = y_k$$\nwhere $(e_k)_n$ is the $n$-th component of the sequence $e_k$.\n\nNow we apply this to the given condition:\n$$f(e_n - e_{n+1}) = f(e_n) - f(e_{n+1}) = y_n - y_{n+1}$$\nThis gives us a recurrence relation for the components of the sequence $y$:\n$$y_n - y_{n+1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1$$\n\nWe need to find the sequence $y$. From the recurrence, we can write $y_{k+1} = y_k - (1/3)^k$. Let's express $y_n$ in terms of $y_1$:\n$$y_2 = y_1 - (1/3)^1$$\n$$y_3 = y_2 - (1/3)^2 = y_1 - (1/3)^1 - (1/3)^2$$\nBy induction, we find the general expression for $y_n$:\n$$y_n = y_1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^k \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 2$$\n\nSince $y \\in \\ell^1$, its series $\\sum |y_n|$ must converge. A necessary condition for series convergence is that the terms must tend to zero, i.e., $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n = 0$. We apply this condition to our expression for $y_n$:\n$$0 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( y_1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^k \\right) = y_1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^k$$\nThe infinite sum is a geometric series with first term $a=1/3$ and ratio $r=1/3$. Its sum is $\\frac{a}{1-r} = \\frac{1/3}{1 - 1/3} = \\frac{1/3}{2/3} = 1/2$.\nSo, we have:\n$$0 = y_1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\implies y_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow we can determine the explicit formula for $y_n$. For $n \\ge 2$:\n$$y_n = \\frac{1}{2} - \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^k = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1/3(1 - (1/3)^{n-1})}{1 - 1/3} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (1/3)^{n-1}) = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$$\nFor $n=1$, we already found $y_1 = 1/2$. The formula $y_n = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$ also holds for $n=1$, since $y_1 = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{0}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThus, the representing sequence is $y = \\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}\\right)_{n \\ge 1}$.\n\nLet's check if $y \\in \\ell^1$:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |y_n| = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^k$$\nThis is a geometric series with sum $\\frac{1}{1-1/3} = \\frac{3}{2}$. So, $\\|y\\|_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$, which is finite.
