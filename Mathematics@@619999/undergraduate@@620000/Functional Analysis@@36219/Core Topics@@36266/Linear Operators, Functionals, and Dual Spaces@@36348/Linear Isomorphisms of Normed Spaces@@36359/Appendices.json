Let $y = T(x)$, where $x=(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)$. The definition of $T$ gives the following system of equations:\n$$ y_1 = 2 x_3 $$\n$$ y_2 = -\\frac{3}{2} x_1 $$\n$$ y_3 = -5 x_4 $$\n$$ y_4 = \\frac{2}{3} x_2 $$\nTo find the inverse map $x = T^{-1}(y)$, we solve for each $x_i$ in terms of the $y_i$:\n$$ x_1 = -\\frac{2}{3} y_2 $$\n$$ x_2 = \\frac{3}{2} y_4 $$\n$$ x_3 = \\frac{1}{2} y_1 $$\n$$ x_4 = -\\frac{1}{5} y_3 $$\nSo, the action of the inverse operator $T^{-1}$ on a vector $y$ is:\n$$ T^{-1}(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4) = \\left(-\\frac{2}{3} y_2, \\frac{3}{2} y_4, \\frac{1}{2} y_1, -\\frac{1}{5} y_3\\right) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the $\\ell^7$-norm of the vector $T^{-1}(y)$:\n$$ \\|T^{-1}(y)\\|_7 = \\left( \\left|-\\frac{2}{3} y_2\\right|^7 + \\left|\\frac{3}{2} y_4\\right|^7 + \\left|\\frac{1}{2} y_1\\right|^7 + \\left|-\\frac{1}{5} y_3\\right|^7 \\right)^{1/7} $$\nTaking the 7th power of the norm, we get:\n$$ \\|T^{-1}(y)\\|_7^7 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^7 |y_2|^7 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 |y_4|^7 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^7 |y_1|^7 + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^7 |y_3|^7 $$\nFor clarity, we can reorder the terms based on the index of $y$:\n$$ \\|T^{-1}(y)\\|_7^7 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^7 |y_1|^7 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^7 |y_2|^7 + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^7 |y_3|^7 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 |y_4|^7 $$\nTo find the operator norm $\\|T^{-1}\\|$, we must find the supremum of $\\|T^{-1}(y)\\|_7$ subject to the constraint $\\|y\\|_7 = 1$, which is equivalent to $|y_1|^7 + |y_2|^7 + |y_3|^7 + |y_4|^7 = 1$.

The maximum value will be achieved at one of the vertices of the simplex. The vertices are $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,0,1)$. The maximum value of $F$ is the maximum of its coefficients. Let's compare the coefficients:\n$$ C_1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^7, \\quad C_2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^7, \\quad C_3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^7, \\quad C_4 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 $$\nBy comparing the bases, we have $\\frac{1}{5} < \\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{2}{3} < \\frac{3}{2}$. Since the exponent is positive, this ordering is preserved for the 7th powers. Thus, the largest coefficient is $C_4 = (\\frac{3}{2})^7$.\n\nThe maximum value of $\\|T^{-1}(y)\\|_7^7$ for $\\|y\\|_7=1$ is therefore $(\\frac{3}{2})^7$. This occurs, for example, when $y=(0,0,0,1)$, which gives $b_4=1$ and $b_1=b_2=b_3=0$.\n\nFinally, we find the operator norm by taking the 7th root:\n$$ \\|T^{-1}\\| = \\left( \\sup_{\\|y\\|_7=1} \\|T^{-1}(y)\\|_7^7 \\right)^{1/7} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 \\right)^{1/7} = \\frac{3}{2} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "1868927"}, {"introduction": "Next, we move from the discrete world of finite vectors to the continuous realm of function spaces.
