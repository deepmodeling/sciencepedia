A complete normed space is a Banach space.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the validity of the options that make definitive claims about the space's properties.\n\nOption E claims that not every sequence in $\\ell^1$ is bounded. If a sequence $x = (x_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ is in $\\ell^1$, then the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |x_n|$ converges. A necessary condition for the convergence of any series is that its terms must approach zero. Thus, for any $x \\in \\ell^1$, we must have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |x_n| = 0$. A sequence that converges to zero is necessarily bounded. Therefore, every sequence in $\\ell^1$ is bounded, and its supremum norm $\\|x\\|_\\infty$ is finite. So, option E is incorrect.\n\nOption C claims that $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ is not a valid norm on $\\ell^1$. The space $\\ell^1$ is a vector subspace of the space of all bounded sequences, $\\ell^\\infty$. The supremum norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ is the standard norm on $\\ell^\\infty$, and it is well-known to satisfy the three norm axioms (positive definiteness, absolute homogeneity, and the triangle inequality). Since $\\ell^1$ is a subspace of $\\ell^\\infty$, these axioms automatically hold for all elements in $\\ell^1$. Thus, $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ is a valid normed vector space. Option C is incorrect.\n\nNow we must determine if the space is complete. To do this, we need to check if every Cauchy sequence in $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ converges to a limit that is also an element of $\\ell^1$. Let's try to construct a counterexample to prove the space is not complete. A counterexample would consist of a sequence of sequences, $\\{x^{(k)}\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$, such that:\n1. Each sequence $x^{(k)}$ is in $\\ell^1$.\n2. The sequence $\\{x^{(k)}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to the $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ norm.\n3.

Is $x^{(k)} \\in \\ell^1$ for every $k$? The sum of the absolute values of its terms is $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |x_n^{(k)}| = \\sum_{n=1}^k \\frac{1}{n}$. This is the $k$-th harmonic number, which is a finite sum and therefore finite for any given $k$. Thus, $x^{(k)} \\in \\ell^1$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\n2.  Is $\\{x^{(k)}\\}$ a Cauchy sequence in $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$? Let's take two integers $k, m$ and assume without loss of generality that $k > m$. The difference is the sequence $x^{(k)} - x^{(m)}$. Its $n$-th term is:\n    $$ (x^{(k)} - x^{(m)})_n = x_n^{(k)} - x_n^{(m)} = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } n \\le m \\\\ \\frac{1}{n} & \\text{if } m < n \\le k \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n > k \\end{cases} $$\n    The supremum norm of this difference is:\n    $$ \\|x^{(k)} - x^{(m)}\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{n \\ge 1} |(x^{(k)} - x^{(m)})_n| = \\sup_{m < n \\le k} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{m+1} $$\n    For any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose an integer $N > 1/\\epsilon$. Then for any $k, m > N$, we have $\\|x^{(k)} - x^{(m)}\\|_\\infty = \\frac{1}{\\min(k,m)+1} < \\frac{1}{N+1} < \\epsilon$. This shows that $\\{x^{(k)}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence.\n\n3.  What is the limit $x^*$ and is it in $\\ell^1$? The Cauchy sequence $\\{x^{(k)}\\}$ has a limit in the complete space $(\\ell^\\infty, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$. This limit, $x^*$, is found by taking the pointwise limit of the terms. For any fixed $n$, as $k \\to \\infty$, we eventually have $k \\ge n$, so $x_n^{(k)} = 1/n$. Thus, the limit sequence is $x^* = (x_n^*)_{n=1}^\\infty$ where $x_n^* = 1/n$ for all $n \\ge 1$. This is the harmonic sequence.\n    Now, we check if $x^* \\in \\ell^1$. We must evaluate the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |x_n^*| = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}$. This is the harmonic series, which is famously divergent. Therefore, $x^*$ is not in $\\ell^1$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a Cauchy sequence in $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ whose limit exists but is not in $\\ell^1$. This demonstrates that the space is not complete. Hence, $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ is not a Banach space.\n\nThis conclusion invalidates option B. Our counterexample directly contradicts the claim that every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit within $\\ell^1$.\n\nOption A suggests the space is a Banach space because it is a subspace of a Banach space. While $(\\ell^1, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ is indeed a subspace of the Banach space $(\\ell^\\infty, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$, a subspace of a Banach space is itself a Banach space if and only if it is a closed set in the parent space. Our finding that there is a sequence in $\\ell^1$ that converges to a limit outside of $\\ell^1$ means that $\\ell^1$ is not a closed subset of $\\ell^\\infty$. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption D states that the space is not a Banach space because a Cauchy sequence of elements from $\\ell^1$ can converge (in the supremum norm) to a limit not in $\\ell^1$.
