We will compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate $\\|p\\|_{\\infty}$**\n\nFirst, we need to find the supremum of $|p(t)|$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, where $p(t) = t^3 - t^4$.\nWe can factor the polynomial as $p(t) = t^3(1-t)$. For $t \\in [0,1]$, both $t^3$ and $(1-t)$ are non-negative. Therefore, $p(t) \\ge 0$ on this interval, and we have $|p(t)| = p(t)$. We need to find the maximum value of $p(t)$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nTo find the maximum, we use calculus. We compute the derivative of $p(t)$ and find its critical points.\n$$\np'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3 - t^4) = 3t^2 - 4t^3\n$$\nSet the derivative to zero to find the critical points:\n$$\n3t^2 - 4t^3 = 0\n$$\n$$\nt^2(3 - 4t) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions are $t=0$ and $t=3/4$. Both of these critical points lie within the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nThe maximum value of a continuous function on a closed interval occurs either at a critical point or at the endpoints of the interval. The endpoints are $t=0$ and $t=1$.\nWe evaluate $p(t)$ at these points:\n- At $t=0$: $p(0) = 0^3 - 0^4 = 0$.\n- At $t=1$: $p(1) = 1^3 - 1^4 = 0$.\n- At $t=3/4$:\n$$\np\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3 - \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^4 = \\frac{27}{64} - \\frac{81}{256} = \\frac{27 \\times 4}{256} - \\frac{81}{256} = \\frac{108 - 81}{256} = \\frac{27}{256}\n$$\nComparing these values, the maximum value of $p(t)$ on $[0,1]$ is $\\frac{27}{256}$.\nTherefore, $\\|p\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} |p(t)| = \\frac{27}{256}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $\\|D(p)\\|_{\\infty}$**\n\nNext, we find the norm of the derivative of $p(t)$. The operator $D$ maps $p(t)$ to its derivative. From Step 1, we already found the derivative:\n$$\nD(p)(t) = p'(t) = 3t^2 - 4t^3\n$$\nLet's call this new polynomial $q(t) = 3t^2 - 4t^3$. We need to find $\\|q\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} |q(t)|$.\nUnlike $p(t)$, $q(t)$ may take on negative values, so we must consider its absolute value. We will find the extrema of $q(t)$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nFirst, find the critical points of $q(t)$ by taking its derivative:\n$$\nq'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 4t^3) = 6t - 12t^2\n$$\nSet $q'(t)$ to zero:\n$$\n6t - 12t^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n6t(1 - 2t) = 0\n$$\nThe critical points are $t=0$ and $t=1/2$, both of which are in $[0,1]$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $q(t)$ at the endpoints ($t=0, t=1$) and the critical point ($t=1/2$):\n- At $t=0$: $q(0) = 3(0)^2 - 4(0)^3 = 0$.\n- At $t=1$: $q(1) = 3(1)^2 - 4(1)^3 = 3 - 4 = -1$.\n- At $t=1/2$: $q(1/2) = 3(1/2)^2 - 4(1/2)^3 = 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - 4\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe extreme values of $q(t)$ on $[0,1]$ are $0$, $-1$, and $1/4$. To find the supremum of $|q(t)|$, we take the absolute values of these extrema and find the maximum:\n$$\n|0|=0, \\quad |-1|=1, \\quad |1/4|=1/4\n$$\nThe maximum of these values is $1$.\nThus, $\\|D(p)\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} |3t^2 - 4t^3| = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the ratio**\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio using the norms we calculated:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|D(p)\\|_{\\infty}}{\\|p\\|_{\\infty}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{27}{256}} = \\frac{256}{27}\n$$\nSince an isometry requires this ratio to be 1 for any non-zero polynomial, this calculation demonstrates that the differentiation operator $D$ is not an isometry on this space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{256}{27}}$$", "id": "1867606"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that differentiation often fails to preserve a function's norm, it's natural to wonder about its inverse operation: integration.
