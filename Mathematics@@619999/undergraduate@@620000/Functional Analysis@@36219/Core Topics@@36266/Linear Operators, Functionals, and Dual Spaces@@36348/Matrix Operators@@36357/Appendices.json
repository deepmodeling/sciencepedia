This exercise explores this connection in its simplest form, the rank-one operator, which is constructed from the outer product of two vectors. By analyzing how this operator acts on a specific vector, you can directly determine its single non-zero eigenvalue, providing a foundational insight into how an operator's construction dictates its behavior [@problem_id:1869176].", "problem": "Consider two non-zero column vectors, $u$ and $v$, in the real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ is constructed using the outer product of these vectors, defined as $A = uv^T$, where $v^T$ is the transpose of $v$. It is a known property of such a rank-one matrix that it possesses exactly one non-zero eigenvalue, with all other $n-1$ eigenvalues being zero.\n\nDetermine a closed-form analytic expression for this single non-zero eigenvalue in terms of the vectors $u$ and $v$.", "solution": "Let $u,v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be non-zero column vectors and let $A=uv^{T}$. To determine the eigenvalues of $A$, first evaluate the action of $A$ on $u$:\n$$\nAu = u v^{T} u = (v^{T}u) \\, u.\n$$\nThus, $u$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with corresponding eigenvalue $v^{T}u$.\n\nNext, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $v^{T}x=0$ (i.e., $x$ lies in the hyperplane orthogonal to $v$), we have\n$$\nAx = u v^{T} x = u \\cdot 0 = 0,\n$$\nso every such $x$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $0$. This shows that $0$ is an eigenvalue with geometric multiplicity at least $n-1$.\n\nFurthermore, compute the square of $A$:\n$$\nA^{2} = (uv^{T})(uv^{T}) = u (v^{T}u) v^{T} = (v^{T}u) \\, (uv^{T}) = (v^{T}u) \\, A.\n$$\nThis identity implies that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $t(t - v^{T}u)$, hence the only possible eigenvalues are $0$ and $v^{T}u$. Since $A$ has rank one, there can be at most one non-zero eigenvalue; the preceding computation shows that this eigenvalue is $v^{T}u$.\n\nAs a consistency check, the trace satisfies\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(A) = \\operatorname{tr}(uv^{T}) = \\operatorname{tr}(v^{T}u) = v^{T}u,\n$$\nwhich equals the sum of the eigenvalues and confirms that the unique (possibly zero) non-zero eigenvalue is $v^{T}u$.\n\nNote: If $v^{T}u=0$, then all eigenvalues are $0$ and $A^{2}=0$; otherwise, the single non-zero eigenvalue is $v^{T}u$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{v^{T}u}$$", "id": "1869176"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond analyzing a given matrix, this practice challenges you to solve the inverse problem: constructing an operator with a specific, predefined spectrum.
