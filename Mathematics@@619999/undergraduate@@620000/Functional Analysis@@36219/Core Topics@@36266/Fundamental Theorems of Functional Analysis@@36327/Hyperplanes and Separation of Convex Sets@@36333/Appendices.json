The boundary of this set is the parabola defined by the function $f(x) = x^2$. The given point is $p_0 = (1, 1)$. We can verify that this is a boundary point since for $x_0=1$, $f(1) = 1^2 = 1$, so $(1, f(1))$ is on the boundary curve.\n\nFor a convex set defined as the epigraph of a differentiable function (i.e., the set of points lying on or above the function's graph), the supporting line at a boundary point $(x_0, f(x_0))$ is the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.\n\nThe general equation for a tangent line to a function $f(x)$ at the point $(x_0, f(x_0))$ is given by the point-slope formula:\n$$y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$$\nwhere $f'(x_0)$ is the derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated at $x_0$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^2$:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$$\n\nNext, we evaluate this derivative at the point $x_0 = 1$ to find the slope of the tangent line at $(1, 1)$:\n$$m = f'(1) = 2(1) = 2$$\n\nNow we substitute the point $(x_0, f(x_0)) = (1, 1)$ and the slope $m = 2$ into the tangent line equation:\n$$y - 1 = 2(x - 1)$$\n\nTo find the values of $a$ and $c$, we rearrange this equation into the specified form $ax - y = c$.\n$$y - 1 = 2x - 2$$\n$$y = 2x - 1$$\n$$2x - y = 1$$\n\nBy comparing this equation, $2x - y = 1$, with the required form, $ax - y = c$, we can identify the coefficients:\n$$a = 2$$\n$$c = 1$$\n\nTo confirm that this is indeed a supporting line, we must verify that the entire set $C$ lies on one side of the line $2x - y = 1$. The line divides the plane into two closed half-planes: $2x - y \\le 1$ (equivalent to $y \\ge 2x - 1$) and $2x - y \\ge 1$ (equivalent to $y \\le 2x - 1$). For any point $(x, y) \\in C$, we know that $y \\ge x^2$. We need to show that this implies either $y \\ge 2x - 1$ or $y \\le 2x - 1$ for all such points.\nLet's check the first condition, $y \\ge 2x-1$. Since for any $(x,y) \\in C$, we have $y \\ge x^2$, it is sufficient to show that $x^2 \\ge 2x-1$ for all real $x$.\n$$x^2 \\ge 2x - 1$$\n$$x^2 - 2x + 1 \\ge 0$$\n$$(x - 1)^2 \\ge 0$$\nThis inequality is true for all real numbers $x$.
