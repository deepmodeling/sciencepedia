The graph is not closed. This is demonstrated by the sequence of polynomials $p_n(x) = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.

In the larger space of continuous functions $C([0,1]) \\times C([0,1])$, the sequence of pairs $(p_n, Dp_n)$ converges to the limit point $(e^x, e^x)$.

For any sequence of polynomials $(p_n)$ that converges uniformly to a polynomial $p \\in X$, and whose derivatives $(Dp_n)$ also converge uniformly to a polynomial $q \\in X$, a fundamental theorem of real analysis ensures that the derivative of the limit function is the limit of the derivative functions.
