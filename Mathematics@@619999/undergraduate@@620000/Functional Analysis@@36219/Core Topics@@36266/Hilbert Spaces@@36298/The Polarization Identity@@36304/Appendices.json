This space is a real inner product space, denoted by $V$, with an inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$. The norm of a vector $x$, which represents its magnitude, is given by $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x \\rangle}$.\n\nConsider two distinct states represented by vectors $v$ and $w$ in $V$. The magnitudes of these individual states have been measured to be $\\|v\\| = 2$ and $\\|w\\| = 3$. When these two states are combined, they form a new state $v+w$, whose magnitude is measured to be $\\|v+w\\| = 4$.\n\nDetermine the value of the inner product $\\langle v, w \\rangle$, which quantifies the interaction or overlap between the states $v$ and $w$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the value of the inner product $\\langle v, w \\rangle$ given the norms of the vectors $v$, $w$, and their sum $v+w$. We are in a real inner product space.\n\nThe relationship between the norm and the inner product is given by $\\|x\\|^2 = \\langle x, x \\rangle$ for any vector $x$ in the space. We can use this definition for the vector $v+w$.\n\nLet's expand $\\|v+w\\|^2$:\n$$ \\|v+w\\|^2 = \\langle v+w, v+w \\rangle $$\n\nUsing the properties of an inner product (specifically, bilinearity), we can expand the right-hand side:\n$$ \\langle v+w, v+w \\rangle = \\langle v, v+w \\rangle + \\langle w, v+w \\rangle $$\n$$ = \\langle v, v \\rangle + \\langle v, w \\rangle + \\langle w, v \\rangle + \\langle w, w \\rangle $$\n\nSince we are in a real inner product space, the inner product is symmetric, meaning $\\langle v, w \\rangle = \\langle w, v \\rangle$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\|v+w\\|^2 = \\langle v, v \\rangle + 2\\langle v, w \\rangle + \\langle w, w \\rangle $$\n\nUsing the definition of the norm again, we know that $\\langle v, v \\rangle = \\|v\\|^2$ and $\\langle w, w \\rangle = \\|w\\|^2$. Substituting these back into the equation gives:\n$$ \\|v+w\\|^2 = \\|v\\|^2 + \\|w\\|^2 + 2\\langle v, w \\rangle $$\n\nThis equation, often related to the polarization identity, connects the inner product $\\langle v, w \\rangle$ to the norms of the vectors. We can now rearrange it to solve for $\\langle v, w \\rangle$:\n$$ 2\\langle v, w \\rangle = \\|v+w\\|^2 - \\|v\\|^2 - \\|w\\|^2 $$\n$$ \\langle v, w \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\|v+w\\|^2 - \\|v\\|^2 - \\|w\\|^2 \\right) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this formula: $\\|v\\| = 2$, $\\|w\\| = 3$, and $\\|v+w\\| = 4$.\n$$ \\langle v, w \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (4)^2 - (2)^2 - (3)^2 \\right) $$\n$$ \\langle v, w \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 16 - 4 - 9 \\right) $$\n$$ \\langle v, w \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 12 - 9 \\right) $$\n$$ \\langle v, w \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} (3) $$\n$$ \\langle v, w \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} $$\n\nThus, the value of the inner product between the states $v$ and $w$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "1855799"}, {"introduction": "The power of the polarization identity extends far beyond familiar Euclidean spaces.
