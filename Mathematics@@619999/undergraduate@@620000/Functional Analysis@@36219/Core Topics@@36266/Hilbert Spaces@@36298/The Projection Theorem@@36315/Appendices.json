The Projection Theorem is not just for abstract vector spaces; it guarantees that for any closed convex set, like the spherical workspace of a robot, there is a unique point within that set closest to any external target. This practice [@problem_id:1898062] challenges you to find this point, directly applying the concept of best approximation in a familiar Euclidean setting.", "problem": "A robotic arm is fixed at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ of a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The arm's end-effector can reach any point within a closed spherical region centered at the origin with a maximum reach of radius $R = 5$ meters. A target object is located at a fixed position $x_0 = (4, 8, -1)$ meters, which is outside the arm's reachable workspace. To perform an auxiliary task, the robotic arm must position its end-effector at the point within its workspace that is closest to the target object. Determine the Cartesian coordinates of this closest point.
