This exercise provides a concrete, geometric foundation for understanding the quotient norm, which is defined as the distance from a vector to a subspace. By calculating the norm of a coset in this simple context, you can directly visualize it as finding the shortest \"city-block\" path from a point to a line [@problem_id:1877165].", "problem": "Let $X = \\mathbb{R}^2$ be the vector space equipped with the taxicab norm, defined as $\\|(x_1, x_2)\\|_1 = |x_1| + |x_2|$ for any vector $(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $M$ be the subspace of $X$ corresponding to the y-axis, that is, $M = \\{(0, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\nConsider the quotient space $X/M$. Let $[v]$ denote the coset of a vector $v \\in X$ in this quotient space.\n\nCalculate the norm of the coset $[(3, 1)]$ in the quotient space $X/M$.", "solution": "The norm of a coset $[x]$ in the quotient space $X/M$, denoted by $\\|[x]\\|_{X/M}$, is defined as the infimum of the norms of all elements in the coset. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\|[x]\\|_{X/M} = \\inf_{z \\in [x]} \\|z\\|_X $$\nAn equivalent and more common definition is to see the norm as the distance from the vector $x$ to the subspace $M$. This is given by:\n$$ \\|[x]\\|_{X/M} = \\inf_{m \\in M} \\|x-m\\|_X $$\nIn this problem, the space is $X = \\mathbb{R}^2$ with the taxicab norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$. The vector is $x = (3, 1)$, and the closed subspace is $M = \\{(0, y) \\mid y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. We are asked to compute $\\|[(3, 1)]\\|_{X/M}$.\n\nUsing the second definition, we have:\n$$ \\|[(3, 1)]\\|_{X/M} = \\inf_{m \\in M} \\|(3, 1) - m\\|_1 $$\nAn arbitrary element $m$ belonging to the subspace $M$ can be written in the form $m = (0, y_m)$ for some real number $y_m \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We substitute this into our expression for the quotient norm:\n$$ \\|[(3, 1)]\\|_{X/M} = \\inf_{y_m \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\|(3, 1) - (0, y_m)\\|_1 $$\nFirst, we perform the vector subtraction inside the norm:\n$$ (3, 1) - (0, y_m) = (3 - 0, 1 - y_m) = (3, 1 - y_m) $$\nNext, we apply the definition of the taxicab norm, $\\|(x_1, x_2)\\|_1 = |x_1| + |x_2|$, to the resulting vector $(3, 1 - y_m)$:\n$$ \\|(3, 1 - y_m)\\|_1 = |3| + |1 - y_m| = 3 + |1 - y_m| $$\nNow the problem is reduced to finding the infimum of the real-valued expression $3 + |1 - y_m|$ as $y_m$ ranges over all real numbers:\n$$ \\|[(3, 1)]\\|_{X/M} = \\inf_{y_m \\in \\mathbb{R}} (3 + |1 - y_m|) $$\nThe term $|1 - y_m|$ is the absolute value of a real number, so its value is always non-negative. The smallest possible value for $|1 - y_m|$ is $0$. This minimum is achieved when the argument of the absolute value is zero, i.e., when $1 - y_m = 0$, which occurs for $y_m = 1$. Since the minimum value is achievable, the infimum is equal to this minimum.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of the expression is:\n$$ \\inf_{y_m \\in \\mathbb{R}} (3 + |1 - y_m|) = 3 + \\min_{y_m \\in \\mathbb{R}} |1 - y_m| = 3 + 0 = 3 $$\nThis calculation corresponds to finding the element in the subspace $M$ that is \"closest\" to the vector $(3,1)$, which is the vector $(0,1)$. The distance is then $\\|(3,1)-(0,1)\\|_1 = \\|(3,0)\\|_1 = |3|+|0|=3$.\n\nThus, the norm of the coset $[(3, 1)]$ in the quotient space $X/M$ is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1877165"}, {"introduction": "Next, we elevate our practice from finite-dimensional vectors to the infinite-dimensional world of function spaces.
