Finally, we will evaluate each of the given options.\n\nFirst, let's check if $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence. A sequence $(x_n)$ is Cauchy if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, we have $\\|x_m - x_n\\|_1 < \\epsilon$.\nLet's assume without loss of generality that $m > n$. The sequence $x_m - x_n$ is given by:\n$$x_m - x_n = (0, \\dots, 0, (\\frac{1}{2})^{n+1}, (\\frac{1}{2})^{n+2}, \\dots, (\\frac{1}{2})^{m}, 0, 0, \\dots)$$\nThe non-zero terms are at indices from $n+1$ to $m$. The $\\ell^1$ norm is the sum of the absolute values of the components:\n$$\\|x_m - x_n\\|_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |(x_m)_k - (x_n)_k| = \\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} \\left|\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k\\right| = \\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$$\nThis is a finite geometric series. We can calculate the sum:\n$$\\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n+1+k} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n+1} \\sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n+1} \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^{m-n}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{m-n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^m$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$ (which implies $m \\to \\infty$ since $m>n$), the term $(\\frac{1}{2})^n \\to 0$ and $(\\frac{1}{2})^m \\to 0$. Therefore, $\\|x_m - x_n\\|_1 \\to 0$.\nMore formally, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose an integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $(\\frac{1}{2})^n < \\epsilon$. Then for any $m > n > N$, we have:\n$$\\|x_m - x_n\\|_1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^m < \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n < \\epsilon$$\nThis proves that $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q}), \\|\\cdot\\|_1)$.\n\nNext, we identify the limit of this Cauchy sequence. Let the limit be $x = (x_k)_{k=1}^{\\infty}$. Convergence in the $\\ell^1$ norm implies pointwise convergence for each component. That is, for each fixed $k$, the sequence of real numbers $((x_n)_k)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ must converge to $x_k$.\nFor a fixed index $k \\ge 1$, the $k$-th component of $x_n$ is given by:\n$$(x_n)_k = \\begin{cases} (\\frac{1}{2})^k & \\text{if } n \\ge k \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n < k \\end{cases}$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, for any fixed $k$, we will eventually have $n \\ge k$. Thus, for a fixed $k$, the sequence of components $((x_n)_k)$ becomes constant for large enough $n$.\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (x_n)_k = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$$\nThis holds for every $k \\ge 1$. Therefore, the limit sequence is:\n$$x = \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1, \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2, \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3, \\dots, \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k, \\dots \\right)$$\n\nNow, we must determine if this limit $x$ is an element of the space $c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q})$. For $x$ to be in $c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q})$, two conditions must be met:\n1. All components $x_k$ must be rational numbers.\n2. The sequence must have only a finite number of non-zero terms.\n\nFor condition 1, each component is $x_k = (\\frac{1}{2})^k$, which is a rational number for all $k \\ge 1$. This condition is satisfied.\nFor condition 2, every component $x_k = (\\frac{1}{2})^k$ is non-zero. Thus, the sequence $x$ has infinitely many non-zero terms. This condition is not satisfied.\nSince the limit sequence $x$ is not finitely non-zero, it does not belong to the space $c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nFinally, let's analyze the norm of the limit $x$. The limit sequence $x$ is an element of the space $\\ell^1(\\mathbb{R})$. Its norm is:\n$$\\|x\\|_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |x_k| = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$$\nThis is a standard infinite geometric series with first term $a = 1/2$ and common ratio $r = 1/2$. The sum is given by $\\frac{a}{1-r}$.\n$$\\|x\\|_1 = \\frac{1/2}{1 - 1/2} = \\frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1$$\nThe norm of the limit is 1, which is a rational number.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given statements:\nA. The sequence $(x_n)$ is not a Cauchy sequence in $(c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q}), \\|\\cdot\\|_1)$. This is **false**. We proved that it is a Cauchy sequence.\nB. The sequence $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence, and its limit is an element of $c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q})$. This is **false**. While it is a Cauchy sequence, its limit is not in $c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q})$.\nC. The sequence $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence, and its limit in the larger space $\\ell^1(\\mathbb{R})$ is a sequence with at least one irrational component. This is **false**.

This is **true**. We showed it is a Cauchy sequence, and its limit has infinitely many non-zero terms, so it is not in $c_{00}(\\mathbb{Q})$. This demonstrates that the space is not complete.\nE.
