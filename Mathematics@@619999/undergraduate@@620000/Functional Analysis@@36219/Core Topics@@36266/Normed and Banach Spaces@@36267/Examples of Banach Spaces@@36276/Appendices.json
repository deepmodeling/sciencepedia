Since $f$ is continuously differentiable, the function $f(x) + f'(x)$ is continuous. The integral of a non-negative continuous function is zero if and only if the function is identically zero. Thus, $f(x) + f'(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. This is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution is $f(x) = C e^{-x}$ for some constant $C$. The space $X$ requires that $f(0)=0$. Applying this condition, we get $f(0) = C e^0 = C = 0$. Therefore, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Conversely, if $f(x)=0$, then $f'(x)=0$ and $\\|f\\| = \\int_0^1 |0| \\, dx = 0$. So, $\\|f\\|=0 \\iff f=0$. The definiteness property holds.

This means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n, m > N$, $\\|f_n - f_m\\| < \\epsilon$.\nLet's define a sequence of functions $\\{g_n\\}$ by $g_n(x) = f_n(x) + f_n'(x)$. Since each $f_n$ is in $C^1[0,1]$, each $g_n$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and thus belongs to the space $L^1[0,1]$.\nThe norm of the difference is $\\|f_n - f_m\\| = \\int_0^1 |(f_n-f_m)(x) + (f_n-f_m)'(x)| \\, dx = \\int_0^1 |g_n(x) - g_m(x)| \\, dx = \\|g_n - g_m\\|_{L^1}$.\nSince $\\{f_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(X, \\|\\cdot\\|)$, $\\{g_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $L^1[0,1]$.\nThe space $L^1[0,1]$ is a Banach space, so it is complete. Therefore, the sequence $\\{g_n\\}$ converges to a limit function $g \\in L^1[0,1]$.\n\nNow we express $f_n$ in terms of $g_n$. The equation $f_n'(x) + f_n(x) = g_n(x)$ can be solved using the integrating factor $e^x$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} (e^x f_n(x)) = e^x f_n'(x) + e^x f_n(x) = e^x g_n(x) $$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$ (for any $t\\in[0,1]$):\n$$ e^t f_n(t) - e^0 f_n(0) = \\int_0^t e^x g_n(x) \\, dx $$\nSince $f_n \\in X$, we have $f_n(0) = 0$. So, $f_n(t) = e^{-t} \\int_0^t e^x g_n(x) \\, dx$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $g_n \\to g$ in $L^1$. Let's define the candidate limit function $f$ as:\n$$ f(t) = e^{-t} \\int_0^t e^x g(x) \\, dx $$\nThe convergence of $f_n$ to $f$ is uniform, as shown by:\n$|f_n(t) - f(t)| = |e^{-t}\\int_0^t e^x (g_n(x)-g(x))dx| \\le e^{-t}\\int_0^t e^x |g_n(x)-g(x)|dx \\le e^{-t} \\cdot e^t \\int_0^1 |g_n(x)-g(x)|dx = \\|g_n-g\\|_{L^1} \\to 0$.\n\nThe crucial point is whether this limit function $f$ is in $X$. For $f$ to be in $X$, it must be continuously differentiable.\nFrom the definition of $f$, we have $f(t) + f'(t) = g(t)$ almost everywhere. Since $f$ is continuous, if $f'$ were also continuous, then $g$ would have to be continuous. However, the limit $g$ of a sequence of continuous functions in $L^1$ is not necessarily continuous. This suggests the space is not complete.\n\nTo prove this, we construct a specific counterexample. Let's choose a sequence of continuous functions $\\{g_n\\}$ that converges in $L^1$ to a discontinuous function $g$.\nLet $g(x)$ be the step function: $g(x) = 0$ for $x \\in [0, 1/2)$ and $g(x) = 1$ for $x \\in [1/2, 1]$. Clearly $g \\in L^1[0,1]$ but $g \\notin C[0,1]$.\nConsider the sequence of continuous functions for $n \\ge 3$:\n$$ g_n(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & 0 \\le x \\le 1/2 - 1/n \\\\ \\frac{n}{2}(x - (1/2-1/n)) & 1/2-1/n < x < 1/2+1/n \\\\ 1 & 1/2+1/n \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases} $$\nThe $L^1$ norm of the difference $\\|g_n - g\\|_{L^1}$ is the area between the graphs, which can be calculated as $\\frac{1}{2n}$, which tends to $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Thus $\\{g_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $L^1[0,1]$ converging to $g$.\n\nNow, define the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ in $X$ corresponding to $\\{g_n\\}$: $f_n(x) = e^{-x} \\int_0^x e^t g_n(t) \\, dt$.\nEach $f_n$ is in $X$ and $\\{f_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(X, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ because $\\|f_n - f_m\\| = \\|g_n - g_m\\|_{L^1}$.\nThe limit of this sequence is the function $f(x) = e^{-x} \\int_0^x e^t g(t) \\, dt$. Let's compute $f(x)$ for our specific $g(x)$.\n- For $x \\in [0, 1/2)$: $f(x) = e^{-x} \\int_0^x e^t \\cdot 0 \\, dt = 0$.\n- For $x \\in [1/2, 1]$: $f(x) = e^{-x} \\left( \\int_0^{1/2} e^t \\cdot 0 \\, dt + \\int_{1/2}^x e^t \\cdot 1 \\, dt \\right) = e^{-x} [e^t]_{1/2}^x = e^{-x}(e^x - e^{1/2}) = 1 - e^{1/2-x}$.\nSo the limit function is:\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & 0 \\le x < 1/2 \\\\ 1 - e^{1/2-x} & 1/2 \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function is continuous on $[0,1]$ (at $x=1/2$, $1-e^{1/2-1/2} = 0$, which matches the other piece). Also $f(0)=0$. Let's check its differentiability.\n- For $x \\in (0, 1/2)$: $f'(x) = 0$.\n- For $x \\in (1/2, 1)$: $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(1 - e^{1/2-x}) = - e^{1/2-x}(-1) = e^{1/2-x}$.\nNow we check the one-sided limits of the derivative at $x=1/2$:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 1/2^-} f'(x) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 1/2^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1/2^+} e^{1/2-x} = e^0 = 1 $$\nSince the left and right derivatives at $x=1/2$ are not equal, $f$ is not differentiable at $x=1/2$. Therefore, $f \\notin C^1[0,1]$, which means $f \\notin X$.\n\nWe have constructed a Cauchy sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ in $X$ whose limit $f$ is not in $X$. Thus, the space $(X, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ is not complete and is not a Banach space. This corresponds to option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect as the given norm is not the standard $C^1$ norm, $\\|f\\|_{C^1} = \\|f\\|_\\infty + \\|f'\\|_\\infty$. Option B is the statement for completeness, which we have just disproven.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1861335"}]}
