Applying this formula, we get:\n$$ \\text{LHS} = \\frac{1}{1 - |rs|} $$\n\nNext, let's evaluate the denominator, which is the RHS of the inequality. The RHS is a product of two terms. Let's compute each term individually.\nThe first term in the denominator involves the sequence $\\mathbf{u}$:\n$$ \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |u_k|^p \\right)^{1/p} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |r^k|^p \\right)^{1/p} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (|r|^k)^p \\right)^{1/p} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (|r|^p)^k \\right)^{1/p} $$\nThis is another geometric series with the first term $(|r|^p)^0 = 1$ and the common ratio $|r|^p$. Since $|r|<1$ and $p>1$, we have $|r|^p < 1$, so the series converges. Its sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (|r|^p)^k = \\frac{1}{1 - |r|^p} $$\nSubstituting this back, the first term of the RHS becomes:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - |r|^p} \\right)^{1/p} = (1 - |r|^p)^{-1/p} $$\n\nThe second term in the denominator involves the sequence $\\mathbf{v}$.

Since $|s|<1$ and $q>1$, we have $|s|^q < 1$, and the series converges to $\\frac{1}{1 - |s|^q}$.\nThe second term of the RHS is therefore:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - |s|^q} \\right)^{1/q} = (1 - |s|^q)^{-1/q} $$\n\nNow, we combine the two terms to find the full RHS:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = (1 - |r|^p)^{-1/p} (1 - |s|^q)^{-1/q} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{Q} = \\frac{\\text{LHS}}{\\text{RHS}}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{Q} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 - |rs|}}{(1 - |r|^p)^{-1/p} (1 - |s|^q)^{-1/q}} $$\nSimplifying this expression by moving the terms from the denominator to the numerator (by inverting their exponents), we obtain the final closed-form expression for $\\mathcal{Q}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{Q} = \\frac{(1 - |r|^p)^{1/p} (1 - |s|^q)^{1/q}}{1 - |rs|} $$\nBy Hölder's inequality, we know that LHS $\\le$ RHS, which implies that $\\mathcal{Q} \\le 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(1 - |r|^{p})^{1/p} (1 - |s|^{q})^{1/q}}{1 - |rs|}}$$", "id": "1864990"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of any inequality involves knowing not just when it holds, but when it becomes an equality.

We can analyze the convergence of this series using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which is a special case of Hölder's inequality for $p=q=2$.
