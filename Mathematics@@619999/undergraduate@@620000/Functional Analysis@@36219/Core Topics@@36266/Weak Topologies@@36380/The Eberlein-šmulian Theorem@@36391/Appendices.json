For a closed set, this simplifies: it is weakly compact if and only if it is weakly sequentially compact.\n\nWhen we restrict our attention to a finite-dimensional Banach space, this profound equivalence can be established from more elementary principles without needing the full proof of the theorem.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and fundamental reason for this equivalence in the finite-dimensional case?\n\nA.

The equivalence reduces to showing that in this setting the weak topology and the norm topology agree, because:\n\n1. If the weak and norm topologies on $X$ coincide, then weak compactness is the same as norm compactness, and weak sequential compactness is the same as norm sequential compactness.\n\n2. In any metric space, compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness. The norm topology is metrizable by the norm, hence compactness equals sequential compactness in the norm topology. Therefore, once weak and norm topologies coincide, weak compactness equals weak sequential compactness.\n\nThus, it suffices to argue that in finite dimensions the weak and norm topologies coincide. This can be seen as follows:\n\n- Let $\\dim X = n$ and choose a basis so that there is a linear isomorphism $T: X \\to \\mathbb{K}^{n}$ with $\\mathbb{K} \\in \\{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C}\\}$. The weak topology on $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$ is the initial topology induced by all $f \\in (\\mathbb{K}^{n})^{*}$. Since $(\\mathbb{K}^{n})^{*}$ is spanned by the coordinate functionals, the weak topology on $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$ is exactly the product (standard) topology on $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$.\n\n- The norm topology on $X$ is transported by $T$ to a norm topology on $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$. By the fact that any two norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent, every norm topology on $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$ coincides with the standard topology. Hence the norm topology on $X$ coincides (via $T$) with the standard topology on $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$.\n\n- The weak topology on $X$ is likewise transported by $T$ to the weak topology on $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$, which we have identified with the standard topology. Therefore, weak and norm topologies coincide on $X$.\n\nConsequently, in finite dimensions, weak compactness equals norm compactness and weak sequential compactness equals norm sequential compactness, and since norm compactness equals norm sequential compactness in metric spaces, the desired equivalence follows.
