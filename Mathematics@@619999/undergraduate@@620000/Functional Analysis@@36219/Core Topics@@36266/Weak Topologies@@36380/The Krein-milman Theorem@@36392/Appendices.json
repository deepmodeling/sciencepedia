Its boundary is the union of the semicircular arc $S=\\{(x,y)\\mid x^{2}+y^{2}=1,\\ x\\geq 0\\}$ and the diameter segment $L=\\{(0,y)\\mid -1\\leq y\\leq 1\\}$.\n\nBy definition, a point $p\\in K$ is extreme if, whenever $p=ta+(1-t)b$ for some $a,b\\in K$ and $t\\in(0,1)$, it follows that $a=b=p$. Equivalently, $p$ is extreme if it is not an interior point of any nontrivial line segment contained in $K$.\n\nFirst, we show that every point $p\\in S$ is an extreme point of $K$. Consider any line $\\ell$ passing through such a point $p$ on the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$. For the full disk $D=\\{(x,y)\\mid x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\}$, the intersection $\\ell\\cap D$ is either a single point $\\{p\\}$ if $\\ell$ is tangent to the circle at $p$, or a closed line segment with endpoints at the two intersection points of $\\ell$ with the circle. Since $p$ lies on the circle, in the non-tangent case $p$ is one of the endpoints of this segment, not an interior point. Hence $p$ is not an interior point of any chord of $D$. Because $K\\subseteq D$, for any line $\\ell$ through $p$ we have $\\ell\\cap K\\subseteq \\ell\\cap D$, so $p$ cannot be an interior point of any segment contained in $K$. Therefore, if $p=ta+(1-t)b$ with $a,b\\in K$ and $t\\in(0,1)$, then $a=b=p$. Thus every $p\\in S$ is extreme in $K$.\n\nNext, we show that any point in the open diameter segment $L^{\\circ}=\\{(0,y)\\mid -1<y<1\\}$ is not extreme. Let $p=(0,y)$ with $-1<y<1$. Define $a=(0,1)$ and $b=(0,-1)$. Both $a$ and $b$ lie in $K$. Set $t=\\frac{y+1}{2}$; then $t\\in(0,1)$ and\n$$\nt a+(1-t)b\n= t(0,1)+(1-t)(0,-1)\n= \\bigl(0,\\ t-(1-t)\\bigr)\n= \\bigl(0,\\ 2t-1\\bigr)\n= (0,y)=p.\n$$\nSince $a\\neq b$ and $t\\in(0,1)$, $p$ is a nontrivial convex combination of two distinct points in $K$, so $p$ is not extreme.\n\nFinally, we show that the endpoints $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$ are extreme. Let $p$ be one of these endpoints. Suppose $p=ta+(1-t)b$ with $a,b\\in K$ and $t\\in(0,1)$. Then $a$ and $b$ must lie on a common line through $p$, and $p$ is an interior point of the segment $[a,b]$. However, for any line through $p$, its intersection with the disk $D$ is either $\\{p\\}$ (if tangent) or a segment having $p$ as an endpoint. Intersecting with $K\\subseteq D$ cannot enlarge this intersection to create points on the other side of $p$. Hence $p$ cannot be an interior point of any segment contained in $K$, which contradicts the assumption unless $a=b=p$. Therefore, both endpoints are extreme.\n\nCollecting these results, the set of all extreme points of $K$ is exactly the semicircle $S=\\{(x,y)\\mid x^{2}+y^{2}=1,\\ x\\geq 0\\}$. Among the options, this is precisely option A. Options B and D include non-extreme points from the diameter segment; option C omits the semicircular arc points which are extreme; option E incorrectly excludes the extreme endpoints.

As $A,B \\in S$, we have $a_1=b_1=1$. Hence $A=B=E$, so $E$ cannot be written as a convex combination of two distinct points of $S$ and is therefore an extreme point.
