This initial practice explores the crucial concept of an operator's domain and its closure. Using the fundamental position operator $Q$ as a case study [@problem_id:1881931], you will see how we can start with a well-behaved but 'small' domain of Schwartz functions and determine the operator's natural, maximal domain of self-adjointness. This exercise illuminates the essential technical groundwork of closable operators, cores, and why meticulous domain specification is non-negotiable for unbounded operators.", "problem": "Let $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ be the Hilbert space of complex-valued, square-integrable functions on the real line with the standard inner product. Let $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ denote the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions, which is a dense subspace of $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nConsider the position operator, $Q$, defined by the action $(Qf)(x) = xf(x)$. The initial domain of this operator is taken to be the Schwartz space, so $D(Q) = \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$.

The operator $Q$ is not closable, meaning the closure of its graph is not the graph of an operator.\nE. The operator $\\overline{Q}$ is defined by $(\\overline{Q}f)(x) = xf(x)$ with domain $D(\\overline{Q})$ being the space of all continuous functions with compact support on $\\mathbb{R}$.", "solution": "Let $Q$ be defined on $D(Q)=\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ by $(Qf)(x)=x f(x)$. First, $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is dense in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$, so $Q$ is densely defined.\n\nTo show that $Q$ is closable, suppose $f_{n}\\in\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ with $f_{n}\\to 0$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ and $Q f_{n}\\to g$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$.

As $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is dense in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$, it follows that $g=0$. Hence $Q$ is closable.\n\nDefine the maximal multiplication operator by $x$,\n$$\nM_{x}f=xf,\\quad D(M_{x})=\\{f\\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})\\mid x f\\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})\\}.\n$$\nNote that $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})\\subset D(M_{x})$ and $M_{x}$ extends $Q$. We show $M_{x}$ is closed. Suppose $f_{n}\\in D(M_{x})$, $f_{n}\\to f$ and $M_{x}f_{n}\\to g$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$. For any $\\phi\\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})\\subset\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$$\n\\langle g,\\phi\\rangle=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\langle x f_{n},\\phi\\rangle=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\langle f_{n},x\\phi\\rangle=\\langle f,x\\phi\\rangle=\\langle x f,\\phi\\rangle.\n$$\nSince $C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ is dense in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$, we conclude $g=x f$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$, so $f\\in D(M_{x})$ and $M_{x}f=g$. Thus $M_{x}$ is closed.\n\nNext, we identify the closure of $Q$. If $(f,g)$ lies in the closure of $\\Gamma(Q)$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})\\times L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$, there exists $f_{n}\\in\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ with $f_{n}\\to f$ and $x f_{n}\\to g$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$. The same computation as above with test functions $\\phi\\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ shows $g=x f$. Hence $f\\in D(M_{x})$ and $(f,g)\\in\\Gamma(M_{x})$. Therefore the closure $\\overline{Q}$ is a restriction of $M_{x}$.\n\nIt remains to show that $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is a core for $M_{x}$, i.e., dense in $D(M_{x})$ for the graph norm $\\|f\\|_{M_{x}}=\\big(\\|f\\|_{2}^{2}+\\|x f\\|_{2}^{2}\\big)^{1/2}$.

On this bounded support, multiplication by $x$ is bounded, so\n$$\n\\|x\\phi_{R,n}-x f^{(R)}\\|_{2}\\le (R+1)\\|\\phi_{R,n}-f^{(R)}\\|_{2}\\to 0.\n$$\nSince $C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})\\subset\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, a diagonal sequence $s_{k}\\in\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ can be chosen such that $s_{k}\\to f$ and $x s_{k}\\to x f$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$. Hence $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is a core for $M_{x}$, and the closure of $Q$ equals $M_{x}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\overline{Q}$ is given by $(\\overline{Q}f)(x)=x f(x)$ with domain\n$$\nD(\\overline{Q})=\\{f\\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})\\mid \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|x f(x)|^{2}\\,dx<\\infty\\}.\n$$\nThis corresponds exactly to option A. The remaining options are incorrect because $Q$ is not closed on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ (so B is false), multiplication by $x$ is unbounded and not defined on all of $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ (so C is false), $Q$ is closable (so D is false), and the domain in E is too small and not the maximal domain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1881931"}, {"introduction": "Once an unbounded self-adjoint operator is properly defined, we can begin to investigate its spectrum.
