An operator $T$ with domain $D(T)$ in a normed space $X$ mapping to a normed space $Y$ is closable if and only if for every sequence $(x_k)_{k=1}^\\infty$ in $D(T)$ that satisfies both $x_k \\to 0$ in $X$ and $T(x_k) \\to y$ in $Y$ for some $y \\in Y$, it must follow that $y=0$.\n\nIn our case, $X = Y = \\ell^p$ and $D(T) = c_{00}$. Let $(x_k)_{k=1}^\\infty$ be an arbitrary sequence of elements in $c_{00}$. Let's represent each element $x_k$ as a sequence of its components: $x_k = (x_{k,1}, x_{k,2}, x_{k,3}, \\dots)$. Since $x_k \\in c_{00}$, each sequence $x_k$ has only a finite number of non-zero components.\n\nWe assume two conditions on the sequence $(x_k)$:\n1. $x_k \\to 0$ in the $\\ell^p$ norm.

This means $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\|T(x_k) - y\\|_{\\ell^p} = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to show that these two conditions imply that $y$ must be the zero vector, i.e., $y_j = 0$ for all $j \\ge 1$.\n\nConvergence in the $\\ell^p$ norm implies pointwise (or coordinate-wise) convergence.\nFrom condition 1, $x_k \\to 0$ in $\\ell^p$. This implies that for each fixed component index $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, the sequence of complex numbers $(x_{k,m})_{k=1}^\\infty$ converges to 0. That is:\n$$ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k,m} = 0 \\quad \\text{for every } m \\ge 1 $$\n\nNow let's analyze the second condition. The action of the operator $T$ on $x_k$ is the left shift:\n$$ T(x_k) = S(x_k) = (x_{k,2}, x_{k,3}, x_{k,4}, \\dots) $$\nFrom condition 2, $T(x_k) \\to y$ in $\\ell^p$. This also implies pointwise convergence. For each fixed component index $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, the $j$-th component of the sequence $T(x_k)$ converges to the $j$-th component of the limit vector $y$.\nThe $j$-th component of $T(x_k)$ is $x_{k,j+1}$. The $j$-th component of $y$ is $y_j$. Therefore:\n$$ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k,j+1} = y_j \\quad \\text{for every } j \\ge 1 $$\n\nNow we can combine our findings. For any $j \\ge 1$, we have $y_j = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k,j+1}$.\nFrom our first deduction, we know that for any index $m$, $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k,m} = 0$. We can set $m = j+1$. This gives:\n$$ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k,j+1} = 0 $$\nComparing the two results for $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k,j+1}$, we must have:\n$$ y_j = 0 $$\nThis holds for all $j \\ge 1$. Thus, the limit vector $y = (0, 0, 0, \\dots)$ is the zero vector in $\\ell^p$.\n\nSince for any sequence $(x_k)$ in $c_{00}$ converging to 0 for which $(T(x_k))$ converges, the limit of $(T(x_k))$ must be 0, the operator $T$ is closable by definition.\n\nNotice that this entire argument holds regardless of the value of $p$, as long as $p \\geq 1$. The property that $\\ell^p$-convergence implies pointwise convergence is true for all $p \\in [1, \\infty]$.
