We will examine the identity operator $Tf = f$, arguably the most straightforward operator imaginable. This exercise demonstrates that an operator's closedness is not an intrinsic property of its action alone but is critically intertwined with its domain. By considering the domain of continuous functions $C[0,1]$ as a subspace within the larger Hilbert space $L^2[0,1]$, you will discover why the graph of this operator is not a closed set, providing a foundational insight into the definition of a closed operator [@problem_id:1855081].", "problem": "Let $H = L^2[0,1]$ be the Hilbert space of real-valued, square-integrable functions on the interval $[0,1]$, equipped with the inner product $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_0^1 f(x)g(x) dx$ and the induced norm $\\|f\\|_{L^2} = \\sqrt{\\int_0^1 f(x)^2 dx}$. Let $D = C[0,1]$ be the subspace of all continuous real-valued functions on $[0,1]$.\n\nConsider an operator $T$ whose domain is $D(T) = D$ and which maps functions from $D$ into the space $H$.

The information is insufficient to determine whether the operator is closed.", "solution": "To determine if the operator $T$ is closed, we must check if it satisfies the definition of a closed operator. Let's restate the definition in the context of our specific operator $T$.\n\nThe operator $T$ with domain $D(T) = C[0,1]$ is closed if for any sequence of functions $(f_n)$ in $C[0,1]$ satisfying:\n1. $f_n \\to f$ in $L^2[0,1]$ for some function $f \\in L^2[0,1]$.\n2. $Tf_n \\to g$ in $L^2[0,1]$ for some function $g \\in L^2[0,1]$.\n\nit must follow that $f \\in C[0,1]$ and $Tf = g$.\n\nSince $T$ is the identity operator, the condition $Tf_n \\to g$ is identical to $f_n \\to g$. Therefore, if $f_n$ converges, its limit must be unique, so we must have $f=g$. The definition for our operator $T$ thus simplifies:\n\n$T$ is closed if for every sequence $(f_n)$ of continuous functions in $C[0,1]$ that converges in the $L^2$ norm to a limit function $f \\in L^2[0,1]$, it must be that this limit function $f$ is also continuous (i.e., $f \\in C[0,1]$).\n\nThis is equivalent to the statement that the subspace $C[0,1]$ is a closed subspace of the Hilbert space $L^2[0,1]$. We can test this by trying to find a counterexample: a sequence of continuous functions that converges in the $L^2$ norm to a discontinuous function.\n\nLet's construct such a sequence. Consider the step function $f(x)$ defined as:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1/2 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } 1/2 < x \\leq 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function $f$ is square-integrable, so $f \\in L^2[0,1]$. However, it has a jump discontinuity at $x=1/2$, so $f \\notin C[0,1]$.\n\nNow, let's define a sequence of continuous functions $(f_n)$ for $n \\ge 2$ that approximates $f$. We can define $f_n$ to be 0 up to $x=1/2$, then rise linearly to 1 over a small interval of width $1/n$, and finally stay at 1.\n$$\nf_n(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1/2 \\\\ n(x - 1/2) & \\text{if } 1/2 < x \\leq 1/2 + 1/n \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } 1/2 + 1/n < x \\leq 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nFor each $n \\ge 2$, the function $f_n$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, so $f_n \\in C[0,1]$. Thus, $(f_n)$ is a sequence in the domain $D(T)$.\n\nNext, we check if this sequence converges to $f$ in the $L^2$ norm. We compute the squared norm of the difference, $\\|f_n - f\\|_{L^2}^2$:\n$$\n\\|f_n - f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_0^1 (f_n(x) - f(x))^2 dx\n$$\nThe functions $f_n$ and $f$ differ only on the interval $(1/2, 1/2 + 1/n]$. On this interval, $f(x)=1$ and $f_n(x)=n(x-1/2)$.\n$$\n\\|f_n - f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{1/2}^{1/2 + 1/n} (n(x - 1/2) - 1)^2 dx\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, let's use the substitution $u = x - 1/2$. Then $du = dx$. The integration limits change from $x=1/2$ to $u=0$ and from $x=1/2 + 1/n$ to $u=1/n$.\n$$\n\\|f_n - f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_0^{1/n} (nu - 1)^2 du = \\int_0^{1/n} (n^2u^2 - 2nu + 1) du\n$$\n$$\n= \\left[ \\frac{n^2u^3}{3} - nu^2 + u \\right]_0^{1/n} = \\left( \\frac{n^2(1/n)^3}{3} - n(1/n)^2 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right) - 0\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{3n} - \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{3n}\n$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, we have $\\|f_n - f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\frac{1}{3n} \\to 0$. This implies that $\\|f_n - f\\|_{L^2} \\to 0$, so the sequence $(f_n)$ converges to $f$ in $L^2[0,1]$.\n\nWe have constructed a sequence $(f_n)$ in $D(T)=C[0,1]$ that satisfies:\n1. $f_n \\to f$ in $L^2[0,1]$.\n2. $Tf_n = f_n \\to f$ in $L^2[0,1]$.\n\nFor the operator $T$ to be closed, the limit function $f$ must be in the domain $D(T) = C[0,1]$. However, our limit function $f(x)$ is a step function with a discontinuity at $x=1/2$, so $f \\notin C[0,1]$.\nSince the limit of the sequence is not in the domain of the operator, the condition for being a closed operator is violated.\n\nTherefore, the operator $T$ is not closed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1855081"}, {"introduction": "Having established the crucial role of the domain, we now broaden our perspective to a gallery of operators commonly encountered in analysis.
