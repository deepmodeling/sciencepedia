A subset of $C[0,1]$ is precompact if and only if it is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. We will analyze these two conditions in terms of the sequence $(a_n)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the uniform boundedness condition.\nA family of functions $F$ is uniformly bounded if there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\le M$ for all $f \\in F$.\nFor each function $f_n \\in F$, its norm is given by $\\|f_n\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f_n(x)|$.\nThe function $f_n(x)$ is constructed from two line segments. For $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, $f_n(x)$ increases or decreases linearly from $f_n(0)=0$ to $f_n(1/2)=a_n$. For $x \\in [1/2, 1]$, $f_n(x)$ moves linearly from $f_n(1/2)=a_n$ to $f_n(1)=0$. The maximum absolute value of $f_n(x)$ is attained at $x=1/2$.\nTherefore, $\\|f_n\\|_{\\infty} = |f_n(1/2)| = |a_n|$.\nThe family $F$ is uniformly bounded if and only if there exists a constant $M$ such that for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $\\|f_n\\|_{\\infty} \\le M$. This translates to $|a_n| \\le M$ for all $n$. This is precisely the definition of a bounded sequence.\nSo, the family $F$ is uniformly bounded if and only if the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.\n\nSecond, let's analyze the equicontinuity condition.\nA family of functions $F$ is equicontinuous if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $f \\in F$ and for all $x, y \\in [0,1]$, if $|x - y|  \\delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)|  \\epsilon$.\nFor our family $F = \\{f_n\\}$, we need to find a condition on $(a_n)$ that guarantees equicontinuity.\nLet's find the derivative of $f_n(x)$ where it exists:\n$$\nf_n'(x) = \\begin{cases} 2a_n  \\text{if } 0  x  1/2 \\\\ -2a_n  \\text{if } 1/2  x  1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe derivative is not defined at $x=1/2$. For any $x \\in [0,1] \\setminus \\{1/2\\}$, we have $|f_n'(x)| = 2|a_n|$.\nA convenient way to establish equicontinuity for a family of piecewise differentiable functions is to check if they are uniformly Lipschitz continuous. A function $g$ is Lipschitz continuous with constant $L$ if $|g(x) - g(y)| \\le L|x-y|$ for all $x,y$ in its domain. For $f_n$, the Lipschitz constant is $L_n = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]\\setminus\\{1/2\\}} |f_n'(x)| = 2|a_n|$.\nSo, for any $x, y \\in [0,1]$, we have $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \\le 2|a_n| |x - y|$.\n\nNow, let's see what a bounded sequence $(a_n)$ implies for equicontinuity.\nIf the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded, there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $|a_n| \\le M$ for all $n$.\nThen, for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $x, y \\in [0,1]$, we have\n$|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \\le 2|a_n| |x - y| \\le 2M |x - y|$.\nThis shows that all functions in the family $F$ share a common Lipschitz constant $L=2M$.\nNow, for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $\\delta = \\epsilon / (2M)$. Then for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $x, y \\in [0,1]$ with $|x - y|  \\delta$, we have\n$|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \\le 2M |x - y|  2M \\delta = 2M \\frac{\\epsilon}{2M} = \\epsilon$.\nThis shows that the family $F$ is equicontinuous if the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.\n\nConversely, let's show that if $F$ is equicontinuous, the sequence $(a_n)$ must be bounded.\nAssume $F$ is equicontinuous. Then for $\\epsilon = 1$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ (we can assume $\\delta  1/2$) such that for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and for all $x, y \\in [0,1]$ with $|x - y|  \\delta$, we have $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)|  1$.\nLet's choose $y=0$ and $x=\\delta$. Both are in $[0, 1/2]$.\nThen $|f_n(\\delta) - f_n(0)|  1$.\n$|2a_n \\delta - 0|  1$, which means $|a_n|  1/(2\\delta)$.\nSince $\\delta$ is a fixed positive number, $1/(2\\delta)$ is a constant upper bound for $|a_n|$. Thus, the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.\n\nIn summary:\n1. The family $F$ is uniformly bounded if and only if the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.\n2. The family $F$ is equicontinuous if and only if the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.\n\nAccording to the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, the family $F$ is precompact in $C[0,1]$ if and only if it is both uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. Both conditions are met if and only if the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for $F$ to be precompact is that the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.\nLet's examine the choices:\nA. The sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded. This is the condition we derived.\nB. The sequence $(a_n)$ converges. If a sequence converges, it is bounded. This is a sufficient condition, but not necessary (e.g., $a_n = (-1)^n$ is bounded but does not converge).\nC. The sequence $(a_n)$ converges to 0. This is also a sufficient condition (as it implies boundedness) but not necessary.\nD. The sequence $(a_n)$ is monotonic. This is neither necessary nor sufficient. A monotonic sequence can be unbounded (e.g., $a_n=n$), or bounded (e.g., $a_n=1/n$). An oscillating bounded sequence like $a_n=(-1)^n$ is not monotonic, but the corresponding family is precompact.\nE. The series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n$ is convergent. This implies that the term $a_n$ must converge to 0. This is a sufficient condition, but not necessary.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that is both necessary and sufficient, which is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1885893"}]}
