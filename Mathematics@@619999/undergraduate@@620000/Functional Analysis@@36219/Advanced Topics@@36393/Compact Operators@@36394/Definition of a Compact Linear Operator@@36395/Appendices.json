The space of all polynomials of degree at most one, denoted $P_1$, is a two-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis functions $\\{1, x\\}$. The range of $T_A$ is therefore a finite-dimensional subspace of $C[0,1]$. An operator whose range is finite-dimensional is called a finite-rank operator. A key theorem in functional analysis states that a bounded linear operator with a finite-dimensional range (a bounded finite-rank operator) is always compact.

A standard result states that a multiplication operator $M_g$ on $C(K)$ for a compact Hausdorff space $K$ is compact if and only if the multiplier function $g$ is identically zero. In our case, $K=[0,1]$ and $g(x) = \\cos(2\\pi x)$, which is not the zero function. Therefore, $T_B$ is not a compact operator. Alternatively, the spectrum of $T_B$ is the range of the function $g(x)$, which is $\\sigma(T_B) = [-1,1]$. A compact operator on an infinite-dimensional space must have a spectrum where 0 is the only possible limit point.

Pointwise boundedness (in fact, uniform boundedness): For any $g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, there exists $f \\in B$ with $g = T_C f$.

This shows the family $\\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly Lipschitz continuous, which implies equicontinuity.\nSince $\\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem implies that $\\mathcal{F}$ is relatively compact in $C[0,1]$.

In this case, $\\lambda_n = 1/n$, and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1/n) = 0$. Therefore, $T_D$ is a compact operator. Thus, option D is correct.\n\nE. The operator $T_E: \\ell^2 \\to \\ell^2$ is the right shift operator, $(T_E x)_1 = 0$ and $(T_E x)_{n+1} = x_n$ for $n \\ge 1$. To show it's not compact, we consider the sequence of standard orthonormal basis vectors $(e_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ in $\\ell^2$, where $e_n$ has a 1 in the $n$-th position and zeros elsewhere. This is a bounded sequence as $\\|e_n\\|_2 = 1$ for all $n$. The image of this sequence is $T_E(e_n) = e_{n+1}$. The sequence $(e_{n+1})_{n=1}^\\infty$ is also a sequence of orthonormal vectors. The distance between any two distinct elements in this image sequence is $\\|T_E e_m - T_E e_n\\|_2 = \\|e_{m+1} - e_{n+1}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$ for $m \\ne n$. A sequence where any two points are a fixed distance apart cannot have a convergent subsequence (since no subsequence can be Cauchy). Therefore, $T_E$ is not a compact operator.
