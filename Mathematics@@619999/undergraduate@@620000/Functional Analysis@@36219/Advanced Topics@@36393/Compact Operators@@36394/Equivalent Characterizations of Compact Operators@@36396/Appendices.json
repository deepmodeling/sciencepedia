This is a bounded sequence as $\\|e_k\\|_2 = 1$ for all $k$.\nLet's apply the operator $U$ to this sequence. For $k \\ge 2$, $U(e_k) = e_{k-1}$. For $k=1$, $U(e_1) = 0$.\nConsider the subsequence $(e_k)_{k=2}^\\infty$. Its image is the sequence $(Ue_k)_{k=2}^\\infty = (e_{k-1})_{k=2}^\\infty = (e_j)_{j=1}^\\infty$.\nThe sequence $(e_j)_{j=1}^\\infty$ is the sequence of standard basis vectors.

The set $K$ is bounded.\nNext, we check for equicontinuity. Let $t_1, t_2 \\in [0,1]$ with $t_1 < t_2$. For any $g \\in K$,\n$|g(t_2) - g(t_1)| = |\\int_0^{t_2} f(s) \\, ds - \\int_0^{t_1} f(s) \\, ds| = |\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} f(s) \\, ds|$.\n$|\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} f(s) \\, ds| \\le \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} |f(s)| \\, ds \\le \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} 1 \\, ds = t_2 - t_1 = |t_2-t_1|$.\nGiven any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $\\delta = \\epsilon$. Then for any $g \\in K$, if $|t_2 - t_1| < \\delta$, we have $|g(t_2) - g(t_1)| \\le |t_2 - t_1| < \\delta = \\epsilon$.\nSince this choice of $\\delta$ is independent of $g$, the set $K$ is equicontinuous.\nSince $K$ is bounded and equicontinuous, by the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, it is relatively compact.
