The key to solving this problem is to relate the given equation to the resolvent of the operator $A$ and then apply the Hille-Yosida theorem, which precisely characterizes the resolvent of such generators.\n\nThe given equation is:\n$$Ax - \\lambda x = f$$\nTo connect this to the resolvent operator, which is typically defined as $R(\\mu, A) = (\\mu I - A)^{-1}$, we can rearrange the equation. By factoring out $-1$ from the left-hand side, we get:\n$$-(\\lambda x - Ax) = f$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ gives:\n$$\\lambda x - Ax = -f$$\nThis can be written using operator notation as:\n$$(\\lambda I - A)x = -f$$\nThis equation is now in the standard form for a resolvent problem. The Hille-Yosida theorem provides a complete characterization of generators of contraction semigroups. A core part of this theorem states that if $A$ is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup of contractions on a Banach space $X$, then for every $\\mu > 0$, the operator $(\\mu I - A)$ has a bounded inverse $R(\\mu, A) = (\\mu I - A)^{-1}$ which is defined on the entire space $X$. Furthermore, the norm of this resolvent operator satisfies the inequality $\\|R(\\mu, A)\\| \\le \\frac{1}{\\mu}$.\n\nWe apply this theorem to our equation $(\\lambda I - A)x = -f$. Here, our parameter $\\mu$ is $\\lambda$, which is given to be positive. Therefore, the operator $(\\lambda I - A)$ is invertible, and its inverse, the resolvent $R(\\lambda, A)$, is a bounded linear operator defined on all of $X$.\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of the solution $x$ follow directly from this fact. Since $f \\in X$, the right-hand side of our equation, $-f$, is also an element of $X$. Because $R(\\lambda, A)$ is defined on the entire space $X$, we can apply it to $-f$ to find the solution $x$:\n$$x = (\\lambda I - A)^{-1}(-f) = R(\\lambda, A)(-f)$$\nSince $R(\\lambda, A)$ is a well-defined operator (a function), for each input $-f$, it produces a single, unique output $x$. The domain of the generator $A$ is the range of the resolvent operator, so $x$ is guaranteed to be in $D(A)$. This establishes that a unique solution $x \\in D(A)$ exists for any $f \\in X$. This finding immediately rules out option A (which claims non-uniqueness) and option D (which incorrectly restricts the existence of a solution to cases where $f \\in D(A)$).\n\nNext, we need to find a bound on the norm of the solution $x$. Using the expression for the solution:\n$$\\|x\\| = \\|R(\\lambda, A)(-f)\\|$$\nSince the norm is homogeneous, $\\|R(\\lambda, A)(-f)\\| = \\|-1 \\cdot R(\\lambda, A)(f)\\| = |-1| \\cdot \\|R(\\lambda, A)(f)\\| = \\|R(\\lambda, A)f\\|$.\nBy the definition of the operator norm, we have:\n$$\\|R(\\lambda, A)f\\| \\le \\|R(\\lambda, A)\\| \\|f\\|$$\nNow, we use the bound provided by the Hille-Yosida theorem, which is $\\|R(\\lambda, A)\\| \\le \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ for $\\lambda > 0$. Substituting this into our inequality gives:\n$$\\|x\\| \\le \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\|f\\|$$\nThis result shows that a general bound on the norm of the solution can be established. This contradicts option E. The derived bound is $\\|x\\| \\le \\frac{\\|f\\|}{\\lambda}$, which precisely matches the statement in option B. Option C provides an incorrect bound, $\\|x\\| \\le \\lambda \\|f\\|$.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that is definitively true is that a unique solution $x \\in D(A)$ exists and its norm is bounded by $\\|x\\| \\le \\frac{\\|f\\|}{\\lambda}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1894019"}]}
