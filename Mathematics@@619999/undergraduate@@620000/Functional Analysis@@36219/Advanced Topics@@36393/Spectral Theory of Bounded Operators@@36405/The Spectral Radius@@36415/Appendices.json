We will solve this by calculating each spectral radius individually and then comparing the results. The spectral radius $r(M)$ of a matrix $M$ is the maximum absolute value of its eigenvalues, which are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(M - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the spectral radius of matrix $A$.\nThe matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe characteristic equation for $A$ is $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0-\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (1)(0) = \\lambda^2\n$$\nSetting the characteristic polynomial to zero, we get $\\lambda^2 = 0$, which has a single repeated eigenvalue $\\lambda = 0$.\nThe set of eigenvalues of $A$ is $\\{0\\}$.\nThe spectral radius of $A$ is the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues:\n$r(A) = \\max\\{|0|\\} = 0$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the spectral radius of matrix $B$.\nThe matrix is $B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe characteristic equation for $B$ is $\\det(B - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0-\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 1 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (0)(1) = \\lambda^2\n$$\nSetting the characteristic polynomial to zero, we get $\\lambda^2 = 0$, which also has a single repeated eigenvalue $\\lambda = 0$.\nThe set of eigenvalues of $B$ is $\\{0\\}$.\nThe spectral radius of $B$ is:\n$r(B) = \\max\\{|0|\\} = 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the sum $r(A) + r(B)$:\n$r(A) + r(B) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the spectral radius of the sum matrix $S = A+B$.\nFirst, we compute $S$:\n$$\nS = A + B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we find the eigenvalues of $S$.

The eigenvalues of real matrices are found as roots of a polynomial with real coefficients, so any complex roots must come in conjugate pairs, which does not change the maximum absolute value.
