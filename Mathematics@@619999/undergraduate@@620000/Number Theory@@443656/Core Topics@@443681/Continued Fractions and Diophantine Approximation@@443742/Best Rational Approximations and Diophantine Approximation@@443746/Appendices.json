This is equivalent to verifying that $r_n = q_n^2 |\\sqrt{2} - p_n/q_n|  1$.\n\nFirst, we find an exact expression for the error. The numerators and denominators of the convergents to $\\sqrt{2}$ satisfy the Pell-type equation $p_n^2 - 2q_n^2 = (-1)^{n+1}$. We can verify this for our computed values, e.g., for $n=2$, $p_2^2 - 2q_2^2 = 7^2 - 2(5^2) = 49 - 50 = -1 = (-1)^{2+1}$.\n\nUsing this identity, we express the approximation error:\n$$\n\\left|\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{2}q_n - p_n}{q_n}\\right| = \\frac{|\\left(\\sqrt{2}q_n - p_n\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{2}q_n + p_n\\right)|}{q_n\\left(\\sqrt{2}q_n + p_n\\right)} = \\frac{|2q_n^2 - p_n^2|}{q_n\\left(p_n + \\sqrt{2}q_n\\right)} = \\frac{|-(-1)^{n+1}|}{q_n\\left(p_n + \\sqrt{2}q_n\\right)} = \\frac{1}{q_n\\left(p_n + \\sqrt{2}q_n\\right)}\n$$\nThe scaled error $r_n$ is then:\n$$\nr_n = q_n^2 \\left|\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right| = q_n^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{q_n(p_n + \\sqrt{2}q_n)}\\right) = \\frac{q_n}{p_n + \\sqrt{2}q_n} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{p_n}{q_n} + \\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nWe compute the exact and approximate values for $r_n$ for $n=0, \\ldots, 5$:\n- $n=0$: $C_0=\\frac{1}{1}$. $r_0 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}-1 \\approx 0.41421$. This is less than $1$.\n- $n=1$: $C_1=\\frac{3}{2}$. $r_1 = \\frac{1}{3/2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{3+2\\sqrt{2}} = 2(3-2\\sqrt{2}) = 6 - 4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.34315$.

This is less than $1$.\n- $n=4$: $C_4=\\frac{41}{29}$. $r_4 = \\frac{1}{41/29 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{29}{41+29\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{29(41-29\\sqrt{2})}{1681-1682} = 841\\sqrt{2}-1189 \\approx 0.35357$. This is less than $1$.\n- $n=5$: $C_5=\\frac{99}{70}$. $r_5 = \\frac{1}{99/70 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{70}{99+70\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{70(99-70\\sqrt{2})}{9801-9800} = 6930 - 4900\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.35355$. This is less than $1$.\nSince $r_n  1$ for all $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 5\\}$, the inequality is numerically verified for each of the six convergents. Analytically, $r_n = 1/(p_n/q_n + \\sqrt{2})  1$ because $p_n/q_n > 0$ and $\\sqrt{2} > 1$, so the denominator is always greater than $1$.\n\n### (c) Maximum Scaled Error\nWe need to find the maximum value among $\\{r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$. We analyze the behavior of the sequence $r_n = 1/(p_n/q_n + \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe convergents $C_n = p_n/q_n$ form a sequence that approaches $\\sqrt{2}$. Specifically:\n- The even-indexed convergents $C_{2k}$ are less than $\\sqrt{2}$ and form an increasing sequence: $C_0  C_2  C_4  \\ldots  \\sqrt{2}$.\n- The odd-indexed convergents $C_{2k+1}$ are greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ and form a decreasing sequence: $C_1 > C_3 > C_5 > \\ldots > \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nConsider the sequence of even scaled errors, $r_{2k} = 1/(C_{2k} + \\sqrt{2})$. Since $C_{2k}$ is an increasing sequence, the denominator $C_{2k} + \\sqrt{2}$ is also increasing. Taking the reciprocal reverses the order, so the sequence $r_{2k}$ is decreasing: $r_0 > r_2 > r_4 > \\ldots$.\n\nConsider the sequence of odd scaled errors, $r_{2k+1} = 1/(C_{2k+1} + \\sqrt{2})$. Since $C_{2k+1}$ is a decreasing sequence, the denominator $C_{2k+1} + \\sqrt{2}$ is also decreasing. Taking the reciprocal reverses the order, so the sequence $r_{2k+1}$ is increasing: $r_1  r_3  r_5  \\ldots$.\n\nBoth subsequences converge to $1/(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2}) = 1/(2\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}/4$. Theordering of all terms is:\n$$\nr_1  r_3  r_5  \\ldots  \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}  \\ldots  r_4  r_2  r_0\n$$\nWithin the set $\\{r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$, the maximum value must be the first term of the decreasing sequence of even-indexed errors, which is $r_0$.\n\nThe maximum value is $r_0 = \\sqrt{2}-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}-1}$$", "id": "3081980"}, {"introduction": "While generating convergents is a core skill, it is equally important to be able to assess a given rational approximation.

Semiconvergents (Intermediate Fractions)**\n\nBetween any two consecutive convergents $\\frac{p_{n-2}}{q_{n-2}}$ and $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, there lie $a_n-1$ semiconvergents of the form:\n$$ \\frac{p_{n,k}}{q_{n,k}} = \\frac{k p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}}{k q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}} \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, \\dots, a_n-1 $$\nThese fractions, along with the principal convergents, form a comprehensive set of \"good\" rational approximations.\n\n**4. The Candidate Set for the Optimal Solution**\n\nA theorem from the theory of Diophantine approximation (e.g., as found in Perron's \"Die Lehre von den KettenbrÃ¼chen\") states that the rational number $\\frac{p}{q}$ that minimizes $|x - \\frac{p}{q}|$ for $1 \\le q \\le Q$ must be one of the following:\n1.  A principal convergent $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ such that $q_n \\le Q$.\n2.  A semiconvergent $\\frac{p_{N+1,k}}{q_{N+1,k}}$ where $\\frac{p_N}{q_N}$ is the convergent with the largest denominator not exceeding $Q$, and the semiconvergent's denominator $q_{N+1,k}$ also does not exceed $Q$.\n\nThis theorem drastically reduces the search space. Instead of checking all $q \\in [1, Q]$, we only need to check a small, well-defined set of candidates.\n\n**5. Algorithm Design**\n\nBased on the above principles, the algorithm is as follows:\n\n-   **Step 1: Generate Convergents.**\n    Compute the continued fraction coefficients $a_i$ and the corresponding convergents $\\frac{p_i}{q_i}$ until a denominator $q_{N+1}$ exceeds the bound $Q$. Store all convergents $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, N$ (where $q_N \\le Q  q_{N+1}$) as candidates.\n\n-   **Step 2: Generate Relevant Semiconvergents.**\n    Using the last two convergents from Step 1, $\\frac{p_N}{q_N}$ and its predecessor $\\frac{p_{N-1}}{q_{N-1}}$, generate the intermediate fractions:\n    $$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{k p_N + p_{N-1}}{k q_N + q_{N-1}} $$\n    The denominator is $q = k q_N + q_{N-1}$. We must have $q \\le Q$, which implies $k q_N \\le Q - q_{N-1}$, so $k \\le \\lfloor \\frac{Q - q_{N-1}}{q_N} \\rfloor$. We generate these candidates for $k = 1, 2, \\dots, \\lfloor \\frac{Q - q_{N-1}}{q_N} \\rfloor$. Note that this upper bound for $k$ is guaranteed to be less than $a_{N+1}$, since $q_{N+1} = a_{N+1} q_N + q_{N-1} > Q$.\n\n-   **Step 3: Find the Minimum Error.**\n    Iterate through the full set of candidates (convergents from Step 1 and semiconvergents from Step 2). For each candidate $\\frac{p}{q}$, compute the absolute error $|x - \\frac{p}{q}|$. Maintain a record of the $(p,q)$ pair that yields the minimum error found so far.\n\n-   **Step 4: Apply Tie-Breaking Rules.**\n    If a new candidate $\\frac{p}{q}$ yields an error equal to the current minimum, the tie is broken by selecting the one with the smaller denominator $q$. If the denominators are also equal, the one with the smaller numerator $p$ is chosen. This ensures a unique solution.\n\nThis algorithm is correct because the set of candidates it examines is guaranteed by number theory to contain the optimal approximation. By exhaustively searching this small set, the global optimum for $q \\le Q$ is found.\n\nFor implementation, floating-point precision must be sufficient to distinguish between the errors of competing candidates, which can be very close. Standard 64-bit floating-point numbers (`float` in Python, equivalent to `numpy.float64`) provide approximately 15-17 decimal digits of precision, which is adequate for the given test cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_best_rational_approx(x, Q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the rational number p/q with 1 = q = Q that minimizes |x - p/q|.\n\n    This algorithm is based on the theory of continued fractions.
