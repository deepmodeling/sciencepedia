Provide the final value of $p_3/q_3$ as a single exact rational number.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound, belonging to the field of elementary number theory. The definitions of a finite simple continued fraction and its convergents are standard and correctly stated. The problem is well-posed, as the value of a finite continued fraction is a unique rational number, and all necessary data (the coefficients $a_i$) are provided. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a straightforward computational problem designed to test the understanding of fundamental definitions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe given finite continued fraction is $x = [2; 1, 2, 3]$. This corresponds to the coefficients $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, and $a_3 = 3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the $3$-rd convergent, $p_3/q_3$. According to the definition provided, the $k$-th convergent $p_k/q_k$ is the value of the truncated continued fraction $[a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_k]$. For $k=3$, the convergent is $p_3/q_3 = [a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3]$, which in this case is $[2; 1, 2, 3]$.\n\nThis means we must evaluate the nested expression corresponding to $[2; 1, 2, 3]$:\n$$\n\\frac{p_3}{q_3} = [2; 1, 2, 3] = 2 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{3}}}\n$$\nTo evaluate this expression, we work from the innermost part outwards.\n\nFirst, we compute the value of the innermost sum:\n$$\n2 + \\cfrac{1}{3} = \\cfrac{2 \\cdot 3}{3} + \\cfrac{1}{3} = \\cfrac{6+1}{3} = \\cfrac{7}{3}\n$$\nNext, we substitute this result back into the larger expression:\n$$\n1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{3}} = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}}\n$$\nThe reciprocal of $\\frac{7}{3}$ is $\\frac{3}{7}$. So, the expression becomes:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{10}{7}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the full expression for the continued fraction:\n$$\n2 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{3}}} = 2 + \\cfrac{1}{\\frac{10}{7}}\n$$\nThe reciprocal of $\\frac{10}{7}$ is $\\frac{7}{10}$. The final calculation is:\n$$\n2 + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 10}{10} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{20+7}{10} = \\frac{27}{10}\n$$\nThus, the value of the $3$-rd convergent is $p_3/q_3 = \\frac{27}{10}$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to verify that this value equals the rational number obtained by directly evaluating the nested expression for $x = [2; 1, 2, 3]$. By the very definition of a finite continued fraction, its value is given by the evaluation of its full nested expression. The calculation performed above is precisely this direct evaluation. Since the continued fraction $x=[2;1,2,3]$ is truncated at $a_3$, its value is, by definition, its own final ($3$-rd) convergent, $p_3/q_3$. Therefore, the computation of $p_3/q_3$ is identical to the computation of the value of $x$, and the verification is inherent in the definitions. The value of $p_3/q_3$ is demonstrably equal to the value of $x$, with both being $\\frac{27}{10}$.

Explanation of the canonicalization process**\n\nStarting with a finite continued fraction with non-negative integer partial quotients (after $a_0$), the process to obtain a unique canonical form is deterministic. First, one repeatedly applies the \"zero rule\" to eliminate all interior zeros. Each application shortens the fraction's length, so this must terminate, resulting in a simple continued fraction (all $a_i \\ge 1$ for $i \\ge 1$). Second, if this simple fraction ends in a 1 (and has length greater than 1), one applies the \"trailing 1\" rule. This shortens the fraction and creates a new last term which is at least 2 (since $a_{n-1} \\ge 1$). This process is guaranteed to terminate and produces a unique representation.
