We can simplify it by dividing all terms by $3$:\n$$x^2 - x - 1 = 0$$\nThis is the minimal polynomial for $x$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTo find the value of $x$ and its conjugate, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=-1$.\n$$x = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4}}{2}$$\n$$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\nThe two roots of the quadratic equation are $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\nBy definition, a simple continued fraction with positive integer quotients must converge to a positive value. Since the first quotient of $x=[\\overline{1,1,1,1}]$ is $1$, we know that $x > 1$.\nLet's examine the two roots:\n1.  The first root is $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{4}  \\sqrt{5}  \\sqrt{9}$, we have $2  \\sqrt{5}  3$. Thus, $\\frac{1+2}{2}  \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}  \\frac{1+3}{2}$, which means $1.5  \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}  2$. This root is positive and greater than $1$.\n2.  The second root is $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{5} > 1$, the numerator $1-\\sqrt{5}$ is negative. Thus, this root is negative.\n\nBased on this analysis, the value of the continued fraction $x$ must be the positive root.\n$$x = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\nThe algebraic conjugate of $x$ is the other root of its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the conjugate is:\n$$\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\n\nThe problem requires presenting both values, $x$ and its conjugate, in a single row vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}  \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3088086"}, {"introduction": "While direct substitution works well, a more structured and powerful approach involves viewing continued fractions through the lens of linear fractional transformations.

It is a well-posed problem in number theory, grounded in the standard theory of continued fractions. It is self-contained, objective, and its instructions lead to a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal polynomial of the number $x$ defined by the purely periodic simple continued fraction $x=[\\overline{1,2,2}]$.\n\nStep 1: Construct the linear fractional transformation.\n\nA simple continued fraction of the form $[a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, T]$ can be expressed as a composition of linear fractional transformations. Appending a partial quotient $a$ in front of a tail $T$ corresponds to the transformation $y \\mapsto a + \\frac{1}{y}$. Let's denote this transformation as $S_a(T) = a + \\frac{1}{T}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the transformation $F(T)$ that corresponds to appending the block $(1,2,2)$ in front of a variable tail $T$. This gives the continued fraction $[1,2,2,T]$. We can construct $F(T)$ by composition:\n$F(T) = S_1(S_2(S_2(T)))$.\n\nLet's compute this composition from the inside out.\nFirst, apply the transformation for the quotient $a_2=2$:\n$S_2(T) = 2 + \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{2T+1}{T}$.\n\nNext, apply the transformation for the quotient $a_1=2$ to the result $S_2(T)$:\n$S_2(S_2(T)) = 2 + \\frac{1}{S_2(T)} = 2 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{2T+1}{T}} = 2 + \\frac{T}{2T+1}$.\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$S_2(S_2(T)) = \\frac{2(2T+1) + T}{2T+1} = \\frac{4T+2+T}{2T+1} = \\frac{5T+2}{2T+1}$.\n\nFinally, apply the transformation for the quotient $a_0=1$ to this new result:\n$F(T) = S_1(S_2(S_2(T))) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{5T+2}{2T+1}} = 1 + \\frac{2T+1}{5T+2}$.\nAgain, finding a common denominator:\n$F(T) = \\frac{1(5T+2) + (2T+1)}{5T+2} = \\frac{5T+2+2T+1}{5T+2} = \\frac{7T+3}{5T+2}$.\n\nSo, the linear fractional transformation is $F(T) = \\frac{7T+3}{5T+2}$.\n\nStep 2: Derive the quadratic equation for $x$.\n\nThe number $x$ is given by the purely periodic continued fraction $x = [1,2,2,1,2,2,\\dots]$. This structure implies that $x$ is a fixed point of the transformation $F$. That is, if we set the tail $T$ to be $x$ itself, we should get $x$ back:\n$x = [1,2,2,x]$.\nThis is precisely the fixed point equation $x = F(x)$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $F(T)$ found in Step 1, we get:\n$x = \\frac{7x+3}{5x+2}$.\n\nTo find the quadratic equation satisfied by $x$, we multiply both sides by the denominator $(5x+2)$, assuming $5x+2 \\neq 0$. Since $x$ is a simple continued fraction with positive quotients, $x$ must be a positive real number, so $5x+2$ is certainly not zero.\n$x(5x+2) = 7x+3$\n$5x^2 + 2x = 7x+3$\n\nRearranging the terms to one side gives the desired quadratic equation with rational (integer) coefficients:\n$5x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the minimal polynomial $p(T)$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of an algebraic number over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the unique monic polynomial of lowest degree with rational coefficients that has the number as a root. The polynomial must also be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFrom Step 2, we have the equation $5x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0$. Let's consider the polynomial $q(T) = 5T^2 - 5T - 3 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[T]$. The number $x$ is a root of $q(T)$.\n\nTo obtain a monic polynomial, we divide $q(T)$ by its leading coefficient, which is $5$:\n$p(T) = \\frac{1}{5}(5T^2 - 5T - 3) = T^2 - T - \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThis polynomial $p(T)$ is monic and has rational coefficients. Now we must verify that it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A quadratic polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can check this using the quadratic formula for the roots of $p(T)=0$:\n$T = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-\\frac{3}{5})}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{12}{5}}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{5}}}{2}$.\nThe roots are $\\frac{1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{85}}{5}}{2}$. Since $85$ is not a perfect square of a rational number, its square root is irrational. Therefore, the roots of $p(T)$ are irrational. As $p(T)$ has no rational roots, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $p(T)$ is monic, irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and has $x$ as a root, it is the minimal polynomial of $x$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe final expression for the minimal polynomial is $p(T) = T^2 - T - \\frac{3}{5}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T^2 - T - \\frac{3}{5}}\n$$", "id": "3088087"}, {"introduction": "Not all periodic continued fractions are purely periodic.
