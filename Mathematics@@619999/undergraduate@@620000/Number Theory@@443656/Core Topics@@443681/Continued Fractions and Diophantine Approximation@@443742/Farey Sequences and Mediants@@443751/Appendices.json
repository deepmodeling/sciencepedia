This exercise guides you through the process of building the Farey sequence of order 5, $F_5$, directly from its definition by enumerating and ordering all eligible fractions.

First, we must explicitly compute the Farey sequence of order $5$, denoted as $F_5$. Second, we must verify a specific property for the consecutive terms of this computed sequence. Third, we must provide the cardinality of $F_5$.\n\nFirst, we compute $F_5$. The definition states that $F_n$ is the sequence of all reduced rational numbers $\\frac{p}{q}$ in the interval $[0,1]$ where $0 \\leq p \\leq q \\leq n$ and $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$, arranged in increasing order. For $n=5$, we enumerate all such fractions for denominators $q$ from $1$ to $5$.\n\n- For $q=1$: The possible fractions are $\\frac{0}{1}$ and $\\frac{1}{1}$. We check the greatest common divisor (GCD): $\\gcd(0,1)=1$ and $\\gcd(1,1)=1$. Both are included.\n- For $q=2$: The possible numerators are $p=1$. $\\frac{1}{2}$ is in the interval $[0,1]$. We check $\\gcd(1,2)=1$. So, $\\frac{1}{2}$ is included. The fraction $\\frac{0}{2}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{0}{1}$ but is not reduced, and $\\frac{2}{2}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{1}$ but is not reduced.\n- For $q=3$: The possible numerators for reduced fractions are $p=1, 2$. We check $\\gcd(1,3)=1$ and $\\gcd(2,3)=1$. So, fractions $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ are included.\n- For $q=4$: The possible numerators for reduced fractions are $p=1, 3$. We check $\\gcd(1,4)=1$ and $\\gcd(3,4)=1$. The fractions $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ are included. $\\gcd(2,4)=2 \\neq 1$, so $\\frac{2}{4}$ is excluded.\n- For $q=5$: The possible numerators for reduced fractions are $p=1, 2, 3, 4$. For all these, the GCD with $5$ is $1$ since $5$ is a prime number. So, fractions $\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}$ are included.\n\nThe set of all such fractions is $\\left\\{ \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5} \\right\\}$.\nTo form $F_5$, we must arrange these fractions in increasing order.\nConverting to decimal form for ordering:\n$\\frac{0}{1} = 0.0$\n$\\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$\n$\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$\n$\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$\n$\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$\n$\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n$\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$\n$\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.667$\n$\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\n$\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$\n$\\frac{1}{1} = 1.0$\n\nThe ordered sequence $F_5$ is therefore:\n$$ F_5 = \\left( \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{1} \\right) $$\n\nSecond, we must verify that for every pair of consecutive terms $\\frac{a}{b}  \\frac{c}{d}$ in our computed $F_5$, there is no reduced rational number $\\frac{r}{s}$ with $1 \\leq s \\leq 5$ such that $\\frac{a}{b}  \\frac{r}{s}  \\frac{c}{d}$.\n\nLet us assume such a fraction $\\frac{r}{s}$ exists for a consecutive pair $\\frac{a}{b}$ and $\\frac{c}{d}$ from $F_5$.\nThe condition $\\frac{a}{b}  \\frac{r}{s}$ implies $as  br$ since $b,s  0$. As all numerators and denominators are integers, this is equivalent to $br - as \\geq 1$.\nThe condition $\\frac{r}{s}  \\frac{c}{d}$ implies $rd  sc$, which is equivalent to $sc - rd \\geq 1$.\n\nWe can manipulate these inequalities. Multiply the first by $d$ and the second by $b$:\n$bdr - ads \\geq d$\n$bcs - bdr \\geq b$\nAdding these two inequalities together yields:\n$(bdr - ads) + (bcs - bdr) \\geq b+d$\n$bcs - ads \\geq b+d$\n$s(bc-ad) \\geq b+d$\n\nThis implies that if an intermediate fraction $\\frac{r}{s}$ exists, its denominator $s$ must satisfy $s \\geq \\frac{b+d}{bc-ad}$.\n\nNow, we will verify two properties for all consecutive pairs in our computed $F_5$:\n1. The value of the expression $bc-ad$.\n2. The value of the sum of denominators $b+d$.\n\nThe consecutive pairs $(\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d})$ in $F_5$ are:\n1. $(\\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{5})$: $a=0,b=1,c=1,d=5$. $bc-ad = (1)(1)-(0)(5) = 1$. $b+d=1+5=6$.\n2. $(\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4})$: $a=1,b=5,c=1,d=4$. $bc-ad = (5)(1)-(1)(4) = 1$. $b+d=5+4=9$.\n3. $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{3})$: $a=1,b=4,c=1,d=3$. $bc-ad = (4)(1)-(1)(3) = 1$. $b+d=4+3=7$.\n4. $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{5})$: $a=1,b=3,c=2,d=5$. $bc-ad = (3)(2)-(1)(5) = 1$. $b+d=3+5=8$.\n5. $(\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{2})$: $a=2,b=5,c=1,d=2$. $bc-ad = (5)(1)-(2)(2) = 1$. $b+d=5+2=7$.\n6. $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{5})$: $a=1,b=2,c=3,d=5$. $bc-ad = (2)(3)-(1)(5) = 1$. $b+d=2+5=7$.\n7. $(\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{2}{3})$: $a=3,b=5,c=2,d=3$. $bc-ad = (5)(2)-(3)(3) = 1$. $b+d=5+3=8$.\n8. $(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4})$: $a=2,b=3,c=3,d=4$. $bc-ad = (3)(3)-(2)(4) = 1$. $b+d=3+4=7$.\n9. $(\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5})$: $a=3,b=4,c=4,d=5$. $bc-ad = (4)(4)-(3)(5) = 1$. $b+d=4+5=9$.\n10. $(\\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{1})$: $a=4,b=5,c=1,d=1$. $bc-ad = (5)(1)-(4)(1) = 1$. $b+d=5+1=6$.\n\nFor every pair of consecutive terms $\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}$ in $F_5$, we have confirmed that $bc-ad=1$.\nSubstituting this into our inequality for $s$:\n$s \\geq \\frac{b+d}{1} \\implies s \\geq b+d$.\n\nWe also observe from the list above that for every consecutive pair, the sum of denominators $b+d$ is strictly greater than $5$. The minimum sum is $6$.\nSo, for any fraction $\\frac{r}{s}$ to lie between a consecutive pair from $F_5$, its denominator $s$ must be greater than or equal to $b+d$, and since $b+d > 5$, we must have $s > 5$.\nThis contradicts the condition that $\\frac{r}{s}$ is a reduced rational with denominator $s \\leq 5$.\nTherefore, our initial assumption was false. There is no such reduced rational number $\\frac{r}{s}$ with $1 \\leq s \\leq 5$ between any pair of consecutive terms of $F_5$. This completes the verification.\n\nThird, we find the cardinality of $F_5$, denoted $\\lvert F_5 \\rvert$. By counting the elements in the sequence we constructed:\n$$ F_5 = \\left( \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{1} \\right) $$\nThere are $11$ terms in the sequence. Thus, the cardinality is $11$.\n$\\lvert F_5 \\rvert = 11$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "3085131"}, {"introduction": "Farey sequences are not just a mathematical curiosity; they are a powerful tool in the field of Diophantine approximation, which concerns finding rational numbers that are close to irrational ones.

All errors are unitless real numbers.", "solution": "The user's request is a well-defined computational problem in number theory. It requires the implementation of algorithms to find best rational approximations to $\\sqrt{2}$ from two different sets of candidates: a \"localized Farey set\" and the set of continued fraction convergents. The problem is valid, as it is based on standard, mathematically sound definitions and asks for a concrete, verifiable computation.\n\nThe solution will be structured as a sequence of functions, each addressing a part of the problem. A main loop will iterate through the specified test cases for the order $N$.\n\n### Mathematical and Algorithmic Strategy\n\nThe core of the problem is to implement two distinct procedures for finding rational approximations to $\\sqrt{2}$ and then compare their results. The target value is $x = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n#### 1. Analysis of the Localized Farey Set\n\nThe problem defines a \"localized Farey set\" of order $N$ on the interval $[1, 2]$ as the set of irreducible fractions $\\frac{a}{b}$ satisfying $1 \\le b \\le N$ and $1 \\le \\frac{a}{b} \\le 2$. The task is to find the two fractions in this set that most tightly bracket $\\sqrt{2}$, one from below ($L_N$) and one from above ($U_N$).\n\nThe algorithm to find $L_N$ and $U_N$ will be a direct search based on the provided definition:\n1.  Initialize the lower bound approximant, $L_N$, to $\\frac{1}{1}$ and the upper bound, $U_N$, to $\\frac{2}{1}$. These are the endpoints of the interval $[1, 2]$ and are guaranteed to be in the set for any $N \\ge 1$.\n2.  Iterate through all possible denominators $b$ from $1$ to $N$.\n3.  For each $b$, iterate through all possible numerators $a$ such that the fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ is within the interval $[1, 2]$. This corresponds to the range $b \\le a \\le 2b$.\n4.  For each pair $(a, b)$, check if the fraction is irreducible by computing $\\gcd(a, b)$. The Euclidean algorithm is used for this step.\n5.  If $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, the fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ is a member of the localized Farey set. We compare it with $\\sqrt{2}$:\n    -   If $L_N  \\frac{a}{b}  \\sqrt{2}$, we have found a better lower bound, so we update $L_N = \\frac{a}{b}$.\n    -   If $\\sqrt{2}  \\frac{a}{b}  U_N$, we have found a better upper bound, so we update $U_N = \\frac{a}{b}$.\n6.  After checking all valid pairs $(a, b)$, we will have found the required $L_N$ and $U_N$.\n7.  The errors $E_L = \\sqrt{2} - L_N$ and $E_U = U_N - \\sqrt{2}$ are calculated.\n8.  The best localized Farey error is $E_F(N) = \\min(E_L, E_U)$. The fraction corresponding to this minimum error is stored for the final comparison.\n\n#### 2. Generation of Continued Fraction Convergents\n\nThe problem requires generating the convergents $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}$ of $\\sqrt{2}$ from first principles using the given recurrence relations.\n\nThe algorithm to generate convergents and find the best one with denominator $q_k \\le N$ is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the terms for the recurrence relations: $p_{-2}=0, p_{-1}=1$ and $q_{-2}=1, q_{-1}=0$.\n2.  Initialize the value for the continued fraction algorithm: $x_0 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n3.  Start a loop to generate the coefficients $a_k$ and convergents $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}$:\n    -   Calculate the integer part: $a_k = \\lfloor x_k \\rfloor$.\n    -   Calculate the new convergent numerators and denominators using the recurrences: $p_k = a_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}$ and $q_k = a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}$.\n    -   If $q_k  N$, the denominator has exceeded the allowed limit. The loop terminates.\n    -   Store the valid convergent $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}$.\n    -   Update $x_k$ for the next iteration: $x_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{x_k - a_k}$. A check is included to prevent division by zero, although this is not an issue for irrational numbers like $\\sqrt{2}$.\n    -   Update the previous two terms of the $p$ and $q$ sequences for the next recurrence calculation.\n4.  Once all convergents with $q_k \\le N$ have been generated, iterate through them to find the one with the minimum absolute error, $E_k = |\\frac{p_k}{q_k} - \\sqrt{2}|$.\n5.  This minimum error is $E_C(N)$, and the corresponding fraction $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}$ is stored for the final comparison.\n\n#### 3. Comparison and Final Output\n\nFor each value of $N$ in the test suite:\n1.  The two procedures above are executed to find $E_F(N)$, $E_C(N)$, the best localized Farey approximant, and the best convergent.\n2.  A boolean value, $\\text{Equal}(N)$, is determined by comparing the numerators and denominators of the two best-approximation fractions.\n3.  The resulting triple $(E_F(N), E_C(N), \\text{Equal}(N))$ is stored.\n4.

By tracing the unique path to the rational number $\\frac{37}{23}$ in this tree, you will see firsthand how the sequence of mediants along the path directly corresponds to the convergents of its continued fraction expansion, unifying these two fundamental ideas [@problem_id:3085116].", "problem": "Let $x$ be a positive rational number. The mediant of two reduced fractions $\\frac{a}{b}$ and $\\frac{c}{d}$ with $b0$ and $d0$ is defined as $\\frac{a+c}{b+d}$. The Stern–Brocot tree is constructed by starting with the bounding fractions $\\frac{0}{1}$ and $\\frac{1}{0}$ and recursively inserting mediants between adjacent fractions. The unique path from $\\frac{0}{1}$ and $\\frac{1}{0}$ to a given rational number $x$ is obtained by, at each step, comparing $x$ to the mediant of the current bounds and updating either the left or the right bound accordingly. A simple continued fraction for a real number $x$ is an expression of the form $[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\\dots,a_{n}]$ with $a_{0}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{i}\\in\\mathbb{N}$ for $i\\geq 1$, obtained from the Euclidean algorithm for rationals; its principal convergents are the truncations $[a_{0};a_{1},\\dots,a_{k}]$ for $0\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and the Euclidean algorithm, perform the following for $x=\\frac{37}{23}$:\n- Derive the simple continued fraction of $\\frac{37}{23}$ and list its principal convergents.\n- Construct the unique Stern–Brocot path from $\\frac{0}{1}$ and $\\frac{1}{0}$ to $\\frac{37}{23}$ by successive mediants, and record the full sequence of mediants encountered along the path.\n- Explain, from first principles, why the mediants encountered along this path reproduce the continued fraction convergents for $\\frac{37}{23}$ (and identify where intermediate mediants correspond to intermediate convergents when the final partial quotient exceeds $1$).\n\nFinally, report the total number of mediant steps (comparisons that produce a new mediant along the path) required to reach $\\frac{37}{23}$ from the initial bounds $\\frac{0}{1}$ and $\\frac{1}{0}$. Express your final answer as an integer with no units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is mathematically well-defined, self-contained, and grounded in established principles of number theory.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis of the rational number $x=\\frac{37}{23}$ concerning its simple continued fraction and its path in the Stern–Brocot tree, followed by a calculation of the total steps in that path.\n\nFirst, we derive the simple continued fraction of $\\frac{37}{23}$ using the Euclidean algorithm.

The sequence of partial quotients $[a_0; a_1, a_2, \\dots]$ of a rational number $x$ directly encodes its path in the Stern–Brocot tree. The path consists of $a_0$ moves to the Right (R), then $a_1$ moves to the Left (L), then $a_2$ moves to the Right, and so on. A right move replaces the lower bound with the mediant, and a left move replaces the upper bound.\nFor $x=\\frac{37}{23}=[1; 1, 1, 1, 1, 4]$, the path is encoded $R^1 L^1 R^1 L^1 R^1 L^4$.\nThe mediants generated along this path correspond to the convergents of the continued fraction as follows:\n- The mediant generated at the end of each block of moves (i.e., at each \"turn\" from R to L or L to R) is a principal convergent.\n- The mediants generated within a block of $a_k  1$ moves are intermediate convergents.\n\nLet's trace this for $\\frac{37}{23}$. The bounds are initially $[\\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{0}]$.\n- $R^1$: The $1^{st}$ mediant is $\\frac{1}{1}$. This corresponds to $a_0=1$ and is the principal convergent $C_0$. The new bounds are $[\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1}{0}]$.\n- $L^1$: The $2^{nd}$ mediant is $\\frac{1+1}{1+0}=\\frac{2}{1}$. This corresponds to $a_1=1$ and is the principal convergent $C_1$. The new bounds are $[\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{2}{1}]$.\n- $R^1$: The $3^{rd}$ mediant is $\\frac{1+2}{1+1}=\\frac{3}{2}$. This corresponds to $a_2=1$ and is the principal convergent $C_2$. Bounds: $[\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{2}{1}]$.\n- $L^1$: The $4^{th}$ mediant is $\\frac{3+2}{2+1}=\\frac{5}{3}$. This corresponds to $a_3=1$ and is the principal convergent $C_3$. Bounds: $[\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{3}]$.\n- $R^1$: The $5^{th}$ mediant is $\\frac{3+5}{2+3}=\\frac{8}{5}$. This corresponds to $a_4=1$ and is the principal convergent $C_4$. Bounds: $[\\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{5}{3}]$.\n- $L^4$: This block corresponds to $a_5=4$ and involves $4$ mediant calculations. The bounds are $[L, R] = [\\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{5}{3}]=[C_4, C_3]$. We perform $4$ L-moves.\n  1. $6^{th}$ mediant: $L \\oplus R = \\frac{8+5}{5+3}=\\frac{13}{8}$. This is an intermediate convergent, corresponding to $[1; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$. The new right bound is $\\frac{13}{8}$.\n  2. $7^{th}$ mediant: $\\frac{8+13}{5+8}=\\frac{21}{13}$. This is the intermediate convergent $[1; 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]$.\n  3. $8^{th}$ mediant: $\\frac{8+21}{5+13}=\\frac{29}{18}$. This is the intermediate convergent $[1; 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]$.\n  4. $9^{th}$ mediant: $\\frac{8+29}{5+18}=\\frac{37}{23}$. This is the final mediant of the block and corresponds to adding the $a_5$-th multiple of the previous convergent's components. It is the principal convergent $C_5=[1; 1, 1, 1, 1, 4]$, which is our target number.\n\nThe total number of mediant steps required is the total number of moves in the path string $R^1 L^1 R^1 L^1 R^1 L^4$. This is the sum of the partial quotients:\n$$N = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9$$\nThus, a total of $9$ mediant steps are required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "3085116"}]}
