An integer $k$ is coprime to $60$ if and only if it does not share any prime factors with $60$. The prime factorization of $60$ is $60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. Therefore, we must find all integers $k$ between $1$ and $60$ that are not divisible by $2$, $3$, or $5$.\n\nWe list the integers from $1$ to $60$ and systematically eliminate those that are multiples of $2$, $3$, or $5$.\n\nThe integers remaining after this process are those whose greatest common divisor with $60$ is $1$. The list of such integers is:\n$1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59$.\n\nTo verify, we can check a few non-prime entries:\n- $\\gcd(1, 60) = 1$.\n- $\\gcd(49, 60) = \\gcd(7^2, 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5) = 1$.\n\nCounting the number of integers in this list, we find there are $16$ such integers.\nTherefore, by direct enumeration, we conclude that $\\varphi(60) = 16$.\n\n### Method 2: Using Prime Factorization\nThis method relies on the multiplicative property of the Euler totient function. For any two coprime integers $m$ and $n$, $\\varphi(mn) = \\varphi(m)\\varphi(n)$. The reasoning behind this property will be explored in the next section.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $60$:\n$$60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$$\nSince the factors $4$, $3$, and $5$ are pairwise coprime, we can write:\n$$\\varphi(60) = \\varphi(4) \\cdot \\varphi(3) \\cdot \\varphi(5)$$\n\nNow, we compute the value of $\\varphi$ for each of these prime power factors. For a prime $p$ and a positive integer $k$, $\\varphi(p^k)$ is the number of integers from $1$ to $p^k$ that are not divisible by $p$. There are $p^k$ integers in total, and the multiples of $p$ are $p, 2p, \\dots, p^{k-1}p$. There are exactly $p^{k-1}$ such multiples.\nThus, the formula is $\\varphi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$.\n\nApplying this formula to our factors:\n1. For the factor $4 = 2^2$:\n   $\\varphi(4) = \\varphi(2^2) = 2^2 - 2^{2-1} = 4 - 2 = 2$.\n   The integers coprime to $4$ in the range $[1, 4]$ are $1$ and $3$.\n\n2. For the factor $3 = 3^1$:\n   $\\varphi(3) = \\varphi(3^1) = 3^1 - 3^{1-1} = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n   The integers coprime to $3$ in the range $[1, 3]$ are $1$ and $2$.\n\n3. For the factor $5 = 5^1$:\n   $\\varphi(5) = \\varphi(5^1) = 5^1 - 5^{1-1} = 5 - 1 = 4$.\n   The integers coprime to $5$ in the range $[1, 5]$ are $1, 2, 3,$ and $4$.\n\nNow, we multiply these results to find $\\varphi(60)$:\n$$\\varphi(60) = \\varphi(4) \\cdot \\varphi(3) \\cdot \\varphi(5) = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 = 16$$\nThis method also yields the result $\\varphi(60) = 16$.\n\n### Reconciliation of Methods via the Chinese Remainder Theorem\n\nThe two methods produce the same result, and their equivalence is a direct consequence of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).\n\n1.  **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and Coprimality**: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that any integer greater than $1$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime powers. As we saw, $60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. An integer $k$ is coprime to $60$ (i.e., $\\gcd(k, 60)=1$) if and only if $k$ shares no prime factors with $60$. This is equivalent to the simultaneous conditions:\n    - $k$ is not divisible by $2$, which implies $\\gcd(k, 2^2) = \\gcd(k, 4) = 1$.\n    - $k$ is not divisible by $3$, which implies $\\gcd(k, 3) = 1$.\n    - $k$ is not divisible by $5$, which implies $\\gcd(k, 5) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: The CRT states that if $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_r$ are pairwise coprime integers, then for any given integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$, the system of simultaneous congruences:\n    $$x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{n_1}$$\n    $$x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{n_2}$$\n    $$\\vdots$$\n    $$x \\equiv a_r \\pmod{n_r}$$\n    has a unique solution for $x$ modulo $N = n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_r$.\n    In our case, $n_1=4$, $n_2=3$, and $n_3=5$ are pairwise coprime, and their product is $N=60$. The CRT establishes a one-to-one correspondence (an isomorphism of rings) between the set of residues modulo $60$, $\\mathbb{Z}_{60}$, and the Cartesian product of the residue sets $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$. An integer $k$ modulo $60$ corresponds to a unique triplet $(k \\pmod{4}, k \\pmod{3}, k \\pmod{5})$.\n\n3.  **Decomposition of Counting**: We are interested in counting the integers $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, 60)=1$. This is equivalent to counting the units in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{60}$. The set of such units is denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}_{60})^\\times$. The size of this set is $|\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_{60})^\\times\\!| = \\varphi(60)$.\n\n    Under the CRT isomorphism, an element $[k]_{60} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{60}$ is a unit if and only if its corresponding triplet $([k]_4, [k]_3, [k]_5)$ is a unit in the product ring $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$. An element in a product ring is a unit if and only if each of its components is a unit in its respective ring.\n\n    This means $\\gcd(k, 60) = 1$ is equivalent to the system of conditions:\n    - $[k]_4$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\iff \\gcd(k, 4) = 1$.\n    - $[k]_3$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\iff \\gcd(k, 3) = 1$.\n    - $[k]_5$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\iff \\gcd(k, 5) = 1$.\n\n    The number of choices for each component is:\n    - The number of units in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is $|\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_4)^\\times\\!| = \\varphi(4)$.\n    - The number of units in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is $|\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_3)^\\times\\!| = \\varphi(3)$.\n    - The number of units in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ is $|\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_5)^\\times\\!| = \\varphi(5)$.\n\n    Since the choice for each component of the triplet is independent, the total number of such triplets is the product of the number of choices for each component. Therefore, the total number of integers $k$ coprime to $60$ is:\n    $$\\varphi(60) = |\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_{60})^\\times\\!| = |\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_4)^\\times\\!| \\cdot |\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_3)^\\times\\!| \\cdot |\\!(\\mathbb{Z}_5)^\\times\\!| = \\varphi(4) \\cdot \\varphi(3) \\cdot \\varphi(5)$$\n\n    This demonstrates precisely why the two methods must agree. Method 1 (direct enumeration) counts the elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}_{60})^\\times$ directly. Method 2 (prime factorization) counts the same set by using the CRT to decompose the problem into counting the units in the rings corresponding to the prime power factors and then multiplying the results. The CRT provides the bijection that guarantees the counts are identical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "3084922"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful applications of Euler's theorem is in simplifying large powers in modular arithmetic, but this is also where a common mistake arises.

By analyzing their properties, you will understand the essential role of the coprimality condition in Euler's theorem and the richer structure of modular arithmetic beyond just invertible elements.", "problem": "Work in the ring of congruence classes modulo $12$. Use only the core definitions of congruence modulo $n$ (namely, $a \\equiv b \\pmod{n}$ if and only if $n$ divides $a-b$), divisibility, greatest common divisor, zero divisor (a nonzero class $a$ for which there exists a nonzero class $b$ with $ab \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$), unit (an invertible class modulo $n$), and the Euler totient function $\\varphi(n)$ (the number of integers in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ that are coprime to $n$).\n\nDetermine, with justification from these definitions alone, the lexicographically smallest ordered pair $(a,b)$ with $1 \\leq a \\leq 11$, $1 \\leq b \\leq 11$, $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, $b \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ such that $ab \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$.

Your final submitted answer must be only the ordered pair from the first part, formatted as a row matrix.", "solution": "The problem asks for several related tasks in the ring of integers modulo $12$. We will address each part in sequence, adhering strictly to the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we must determine the lexicographically smallest ordered pair $(a,b)$ such that $1 \\leq a \\leq 11$, $1 \\leq b \\leq 11$, $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, $b \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, and $ab \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$.\nThe condition $ab \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ is equivalent to stating that $12$ divides the product $ab$. We seek the lexicographically smallest pair, so we begin by testing values for $a$ starting from $a=1$.\n\nFor $a=1$: The condition becomes $1 \\cdot b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, which implies $12$ divides $b$. However, the range for $b$ is $1 \\leq b \\leq 11$. No such integer $b$ exists in this range.\n\nFor $a=2$: The condition is $2b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. By definition of congruence, this means $12$ divides $2b$. This is equivalent to the existence of an integer $k$ such that $2b = 12k$, which simplifies to $b = 6k$. We are looking for the smallest integer $b$ in the range $1 \\leq b \\leq 11$ that is a multiple of $6$. The only such multiple is $b=6$ (for $k=1$). Thus, we have found the pair $(a,b) = (2,6)$. Both $a=2$ and $b=6$ are in the specified range and are non-zero modulo $12$. Since we found a valid pair for the smallest possible value of $a$ (namely $a=2$), and for this $a$ we chose the smallest possible value of $b$, the pair $(2,6)$ is the lexicographically smallest such pair.\n\nNext, we explain how this pair demonstrates the existence of zero divisors and the failure of cancellation for non-units.\nA zero divisor is defined as a non-zero class $a$ for which there exists a non-zero class $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$. From our first step, we have the pair $(2,6)$. The class of $2$ is not the zero class modulo $12$, and the class of $6$ is not the zero class modulo $12$. However, their product is $2 \\cdot 6 = 12$, and $12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. Therefore, by definition, both $2$ and $6$ are zero divisors in the ring of integers modulo $12$.\nThe cancellation property, which holds in fields like the real numbers, states that if $ca = cb$ and $c \\neq 0$, then $a = b$. This property fails for non-units in the ring of integers modulo $n$. A non-unit is an element that does not have a multiplicative inverse. Zero divisors are non-units. We can demonstrate this failure using the zero divisor $c=2$. Consider the equality $2 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. We also know that $2 \\cdot 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. Therefore, we can write $2 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 2 \\cdot 0 \\pmod{12}$. If the cancellation property were to hold for the non-unit $2$, we could cancel the $2$ from both sides to deduce that $6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. This is false, since $12$ does not divide $6-0=6$. Thus, the existence of zero divisors implies the failure of the cancellation law for those elements.\n\nThird, we analyze the solvability of two linear congruences.\nThe first congruence is $4x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$. According to the definition of congruence, this means $12$ divides $4x-8$. This implies there exists an integer $k$ such that $4x-8 = 12k$. The greatest common divisor of the coefficients is $\\gcd(4,12)=4$. We can divide the entire equation by $4$, which yields $x-2 = 3k$. This is equivalent to $3$ divides $x-2$, or $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. We need to find all solutions in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 11\\}$.\nThe integers $x$ in this set satisfying $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ are $2$ (since $2-2=0$, which is divisible by $3$), $5$ (since $5-2=3$), $8$ (since $8-2=6$), and $11$ (since $11-2=9$). Thus, the complete solution set is $\\{2, 5, 8, 11\\}$.\n\nThe second congruence is $4x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{12}$. This requires $12$ to divide $4x-3$. So, for some integer $k$, $4x-3 = 12k$. Rearranging gives $3 = 4x-12k = 4(x-3k)$. This equation implies that $3$ is a multiple of $4$. This is false for any integer $x-3k$. Therefore, no integer solution $x$ exists. Using the property that $ax \\equiv b \\pmod{n}$ has solutions if and only if $\\gcd(a,n)$ divides $b$, we find $\\gcd(4,12)=4$. Since $4$ does not divide $3$, the congruence has no solutions.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\varphi(12)$ and analyze Euler's theorem.\nThe Euler totient function $\\varphi(n)$ is defined as the number of integers in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ that are coprime to $n$. For $n=12$, we need to count the integers $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$ such that $\\gcd(k, 12)=1$. The prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. An integer is coprime to $12$ if and only if it is not divisible by $2$ and not divisible by $3$. We list the integers and check their GCD with $12$:\n$\\gcd(1,12)=1$, $\\gcd(2,12)=2$, $\\gcd(3,12)=3$, $\\gcd(4,12)=4$, $\\gcd(5,12)=1$, $\\gcd(6,12)=6$, $\\gcd(7,12)=1$, $\\gcd(8,12)=4$, $\\gcd(9,12)=3$, $\\gcd(10,12)=2$, $\\gcd(11,12)=1$, $\\gcd(12,12)=12$.\nThe integers coprime to $12$ are $1, 5, 7, 11$. There are $4$ such integers, so $\\varphi(12)=4$.\n\nThese coprime integers form the set of units modulo $12$, which we denote by $U = \\{1, 5, 7, 11\\}$. This set has the structure that it is closed under multiplication modulo $12$ and every element has an inverse within the set. For any unit $u \\in U$, the function that maps each $x \\in U$ to $ux \\pmod{12}$ is a permutation of $U$. This means the product of all elements in $U$ is congruent to the product of all elements $ux$:\n$\\prod_{x \\in U} x \\equiv \\prod_{x \\in U} (ux) \\pmod{12}$.\nThis simplifies to $\\prod_{x \\in U} x \\equiv u^{|U|} \\left(\\prod_{x \\in U} x\\right) \\pmod{12}$.\nSince $|U| = \\varphi(12) = 4$ and every element in the product $\\prod_{x \\in U} x$ is a unit, the product itself is a unit and thus has a multiplicative inverse. Let $P = \\prod_{x \\in U} x$. We have $P \\equiv u^4 P \\pmod{12}$. Multiplying by the inverse of $P$, we get $1 \\equiv u^4 \\pmod{12}$, which is Euler's theorem: $u^{\\varphi(12)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$ for any unit $u$.\n\nThis phenomenon fails for a zero divisor, such as $b=6$ from our initial pair. The integer $6$ is not coprime to $12$; $\\gcd(6,12)=6 \\neq 1$. Therefore, $6$ is not a unit and Euler's theorem does not apply. If we compute the power, we get $6^{\\varphi(12)} = 6^4 \\pmod{12}$.\nFirst, $6^2 = 36$. Since $36 = 3 \\cdot 12$, we have $6^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$.\nThen, $6^4 = (6^2)^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$.\nClearly, $0 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$. The reason for this failure lies in the lack of an inverse for a zero divisor. If it were true that $d^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ for some zero divisor $d$ and integer $k \\ge 1$, this would imply $d \\cdot d^{k-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, meaning $d^{k-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $d$. However, an element cannot be both a zero divisor and a unit. If $d$ had an inverse $d^{-1}$ and $dc \\equiv 0$ for some $c \\not\\equiv 0$, then $d^{-1}dc \\equiv d^{-1}0 \\implies c \\equiv 0$, a contradiction. Therefore, the conclusion of Euler's theorem cannot hold for zero divisors.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3084940"}]}
