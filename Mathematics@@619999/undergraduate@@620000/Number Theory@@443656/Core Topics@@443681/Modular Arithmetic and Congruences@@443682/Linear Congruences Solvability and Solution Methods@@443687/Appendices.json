Let the inverse be denoted by $b$. By definition, $b$ is the modular inverse of $a$ modulo $m$ if the congruence $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$ holds.\n\nFirst, we must justify the existence of such an inverse. From the fundamental principles of number theory, the modular inverse of an integer $a$ modulo $m$ exists if and only if $a$ and $m$ are coprime, that is, their greatest common divisor is $1$, denoted as $\\gcd(a,m)=1$. In our case, this means we must verify that $\\gcd(37, 101) = 1$. The integer $101$ is a prime number. The integer $37$ is also a prime number. Since $37$ is not equal to $101$, it does not divide $101$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $37$ and $101$ is indeed $1$.\n\nThe proof of existence relies on Bézout's identity, which states that for any two integers $a$ and $m$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + my = \\gcd(a,m)$. Since we have established that $\\gcd(37, 101) = 1$, there must exist integers $x$ and $y$ satisfying the equation $37x + 101y = 1$. If we consider this equation modulo $101$, the term $101y$ becomes congruent to $0$, because $101y$ is a multiple of $101$. The equation thus reduces to $37x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$. By the definition of a modular inverse, the integer $x$ is the modular inverse of $37$ modulo $101$. The extended Euclidean algorithm (EEA) provides a constructive method for finding these integers $x$ and $y$.\n\nWe now apply the extended Euclidean algorithm to $37$ and $101$. The first part of the EEA is the standard Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd. We have the initial values $101$ and $37$.\n$$101 = 2 \\times 37 + 27$$\n$$37 = 1 \\times 27 + 10$$\n$$27 = 2 \\times 10 + 7$$\n$$10 = 1 \\times 7 + 3$$\n$$7 = 2 \\times 3 + 1$$\n$$3 = 3 \\times 1 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $1$, confirming that $\\gcd(101, 37) = 1$.\n\nNext, we work backwards from the second-to-last equation to express the gcd, which is $1$, as a linear combination of $37$ and $101$.\nFrom the equation $7 = 2 \\times 3 + 1$, we can write:\n$$1 = 7 - (2 \\times 3)$$\nFrom the equation $10 = 1 \\times 7 + 3$, we have $3 = 10 - (1 \\times 7)$.

The value $-30$ is not in this set. We find the equivalent positive residue by adding the modulus $101$:\n$$-30 \\pmod{101} \\equiv -30 + 101 \\pmod{101} \\equiv 71 \\pmod{101}$$\nThus, the modular inverse of $37$ modulo $101$ is $71$.\n\nFinally, we must verify this result. We need to check if $37 \\times 71 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$.\nWe compute the product:\n$$37 \\times 71 = 2627$$\nNow, we perform integer division of $2627$ by $101$ to find the remainder.

It provides all necessary information: the integers $a=84$, $b=126$, and the modulus $m=210$. The definitions and concepts, such as congruence, greatest common divisor (GCD), and multiplicative inverse, are standard and well-defined. The problem is self-contained, mathematically sound, and well-posed. There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, ambiguities, or contradictions. The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution from first principles.\nThe linear congruence $ax \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ is, by definition, equivalent to the statement that $m$ divides $ax-b$. This means there exists an integer $k$ such that $ax-b = mk$. This can be rewritten as a linear Diophantine equation in two variables, $x$ and $k$:\n$$ax - mk = b$$\nA fundamental theorem of number theory states that this equation has integer solutions for $x$ and $k$ if and only if $d = \\gcd(a, m)$ divides $b$.\n\nFor the given congruence, $84x \\equiv 126 \\pmod{210}$, we have $a=84$, $b=126$, and $m=210$. We must first compute $d = \\gcd(84, 210)$. We use the Euclidean algorithm:\n$$210 = 2 \\cdot 84 + 42$$\n$$84 = 2 \\cdot 42 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $42$, so $d = \\gcd(84, 210) = 42$.\n\nNow, we check if $d$ divides $b$. We need to determine if $42$ divides $126$. We perform the division:\n$$\\frac{126}{42} = 3$$\nSince $126 = 3 \\cdot 42$, $42$ indeed divides $126$. Therefore, the linear congruence $84x \\equiv 126 \\pmod{210}$ has integer solutions.\n\nTo find the solutions, we follow the instruction to reduce the problem to a congruence with a smaller modulus. We start with the equivalent Diophantine equation:\n$$84x - 210k = 126$$\nWe can divide this entire equation by $d = \\gcd(84, 210) = 42$:\n$$\\frac{84}{42}x - \\frac{210}{42}k = \\frac{126}{42}$$\n$$2x - 5k = 3$$\nThis equation can be converted back into a congruence. The equation $2x - 3 = 5k$ means that $5$ divides $2x - 3$, which is equivalent to:\n$$2x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$$\nThis is the reduced congruence with a smaller modulus $m' = \\frac{m}{d} = \\frac{210}{42} = 5$.\n\nNow we solve $2x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. Since $\\gcd(2, 5) = 1$, the coefficient $2$ has a unique multiplicative inverse modulo $5$. We seek an integer $z$ such that $2z \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. By inspection, we can see that $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$, and $6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.

All terms are standard and the objectives are clear.\n\nThis problem is divided into three parts. We will address each part sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the element $6$ modulo $12$**\n\nFirst, we will justify that $6$ is a zero divisor modulo $12$. By definition, an element $a$ is a zero divisor modulo $m$ if there exists a nonzero residue class $r$ modulo $m$ such that $ar \\equiv 0 \\pmod{m}$. Here, $a=6$ and $m=12$. A nonzero residue class $r$ modulo $12$ is any integer $r$ such that $r \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, which means $12$ does not divide $r$. We seek such an $r$ where $6r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nFrom the definition of congruence, $6r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ means that $12$ divides $(6r - 0)$, or simply $12 | 6r$. This implies there exists an integer $k$ such that $6r = 12k$. Dividing by $6$, we get $r = 2k$. We need to find an integer $r$ of the form $2k$ that is not a multiple of $12$. We can choose $k=1$, which gives $r=2$. The residue class of $2$ is nonzero modulo $12$ since $12 \\nmid 2$. We can verify the product: $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$, and since $12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, we have found a nonzero residue class $r=2$ such that $6r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. Therefore, by definition, $6$ is a zero divisor modulo $12$.\n\nNext, we explain why \"dividing both sides by $6$\" in a congruence $6x \\equiv b \\pmod{12}$ is not a valid operation in general. The operation of division by an integer $a$ in modular arithmetic is only well-defined if $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $m$. An element $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $m$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $m$ is $1$, i.e., $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$. In our case, with $a=6$ and $m=12$, we have $\\gcd(6, 12) = 6$. Since $\\gcd(6, 12) \\neq 1$, the integer $6$ does not possess a multiplicative inverse modulo $12$. Without a multiplicative inverse, the cancellation law does not hold. For example, consider the true congruence $6 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{12}$, which is $6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12}$. Also consider $6 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{12}$. If we could \"divide by $6$\", then from $6 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 6 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{12}$ we would incorrectly conclude that $1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{12}$. This is false, demonstrating that division by a zero divisor is not a valid general operation.\n\n**Part 2: Solving linear congruences**\n\nWe analyze the two given congruences. A linear congruence of the form $ax \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ has solutions if and only if $d = \\gcd(a, m)$ divides $b$. If this condition holds, there are exactly $d$ incongruent solutions modulo $m$.\n\nFor the congruence $6x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{12}$:\nHere, $a=6$, $b=9$, and $m=12$. We compute the greatest common divisor $d = \\gcd(a, m) = \\gcd(6, 12) = 6$. For a solution to exist, $d$ must divide $b$. We check if $6$ divides $9$. Since $9 = 6 \\cdot 1 + 3$, $6$ does not divide $9$. Therefore, the congruence $6x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{12}$ has no solutions. The number of incongruent solutions is $0$.\n\nFor the congruence $6x \\equiv 18 \\pmod{12}$:\nHere, $a=6$, $b=18$, and $m=12$. First, we can reduce the right side modulo $12$: since $18 = 1 \\cdot 12 + 6$, we have $18 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12}$. The congruence is equivalent to $6x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12}$.\nNow, we check the solvability condition with $a=6$, $b=6$, and $m=12$. The greatest common divisor is $d = \\gcd(6, 12) = 6$. We check if $d$ divides $b$: $6$ divides $6$, which is true. Thus, an integer solution $x$ exists, and there are exactly $d=6$ incongruent solutions modulo $12$.\n\nTo find these solutions, we follow the prescribed method of transforming the congruence. The congruence $6x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12}$ is equivalent to the statement that $12$ divides $(6x - 6)$, which can be written as the linear Diophantine equation $6x - 6 = 12k$ for some integer $k$. Dividing the entire equation by $d = \\gcd(6, 12) = 6$, we obtain:\n$$x - 1 = 2k$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as a congruence with a strictly smaller modulus:\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$\nThe new modulus is $m' = \\frac{m}{d} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2$. This simplified congruence, $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, has the same set of integer solutions for $x$ as the original congruence. The solutions are all odd integers.\n\nTo find all incongruent solutions modulo $12$, we must find the integers $x$ in the set of least non-negative residues $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 11\\}$ that satisfy $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. These are the odd numbers in this range:\n$$x \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\\}$$\nThese are the $6$ incongruent solutions modulo $12$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $T$**\n\nThe value $T$ is defined as the sum of two quantities:\n1.  The total number of incongruent solutions modulo $12$ of $6x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{12}$.\n2.  The sum of the least nonnegative residues of all incongruent solutions modulo $12$ of $6x \\equiv 18 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nFrom Part 2, the number of solutions to $6x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{12}$ is $0$.\nAlso from Part 2, the least nonnegative residues of the solutions to $6x \\equiv 18 \\pmod{12}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\\}$.
