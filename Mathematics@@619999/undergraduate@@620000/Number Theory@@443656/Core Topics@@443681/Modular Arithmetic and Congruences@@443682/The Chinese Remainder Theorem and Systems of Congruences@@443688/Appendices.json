The justification will rely on the foundational definition of congruence, the fact that $\\gcd(4,3)=1$, and Bézout's identity.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution**\n\n**Existence:**\nWe need to demonstrate that there exists at least one integer $x$ that satisfies both congruences.\nThe problem provides that $\\gcd(4,3)=1$. By Bézout's identity, there exist integers $u$ and $v$ such that a linear combination of $4$ and $3$ equals their greatest common divisor, $1$.\n$$4u + 3v = 1$$\nBy inspection, we can find a pair of such integers. For instance, if we choose $u=1$, we have $4(1) + 3v = 1$, which gives $3v = -3$, so $v = -1$. Thus, one solution to the Diophantine equation is $(u,v) = (1, -1)$:\n$$4(1) + 3(-1) = 1$$\nLet the two congruences be written as $x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{n_1}$ and $x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{n_2}$, where $a_1=3$, $n_1=4$, $a_2=2$, and $n_2=3$. We can construct a solution $x_0$ using the expression $x_0 = a_2 n_1 u + a_1 n_2 v$. Let's substitute our values:\n$$x_0 = 2 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (3 \\cdot (-1))$$\n$$x_0 = 8 - 9 = -1$$\nNow, we must verify that this constructed integer $x_0 = -1$ satisfies both original congruences.\nFor the first congruence, we check $x_0 \\pmod{4}$:\n$$-1 \\equiv -1 + 4 \\pmod{4} \\implies -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nThis congruence holds, since $4$ divides $(-1 - 3) = -4$.\nFor the second congruence, we check $x_0 \\pmod{3}$:\n$$-1 \\equiv -1 + 3 \\pmod{3} \\implies -1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$$\nThis congruence also holds, since $3$ divides $(-1 - 2) = -3$.\nSince we have successfully constructed an integer $x_0 = -1$ that satisfies both congruences, we have proven that a solution exists. This construction is a direct consequence of Bézout's identity.\n\n**Uniqueness Modulo 12:**\nNext, we must show that any two solutions to the system are congruent modulo $12$.\nLet $x_1$ and $x_2$ be two arbitrary integers that both satisfy the system.\nThis means:\n1. $x_1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ and $x_2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n2. $x_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $x_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n\nFrom the first pair of congruences, by the transitive property, we have $x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{4}$. By the definition of congruence, this means that $4$ divides the difference $(x_1 - x_2)$, which can be written as $4 | (x_1 - x_2)$.\nFrom the second pair of congruences, we similarly have $x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{3}$, which means $3 | (x_1 - x_2)$.\n\nWe now have that the integer $(x_1 - x_2)$ is a common multiple of $3$ and $4$.\nA fundamental property of divisibility states that if an integer is divisible by two coprime integers, it must also be divisible by their product. Since $\\gcd(4,3)=1$, it follows that the product $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ must also divide $(x_1 - x_2)$.\n$$12 | (x_1 - x_2)$$\nBy the definition of congruence, this is equivalent to:\n$$x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{12}$$\nThis shows that any two solutions to the system of congruences are congruent to each other modulo $12$. Therefore, the solution exists as a single, unique residue class modulo $12$.\n\n**Part 2: Explicit Construction of the Representative**\n\nWe have established that the set of all integer solutions is the residue class of $x_0 = -1$ modulo $12$. We can write this as:\n$$x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{12}$$\nThe problem asks for the specific integer representative $x$ in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 11\\}$. To find this value, we find the smallest non-negative integer that is congruent to $-1$ modulo $12$. We can add multiples of the modulus, $12$, to $-1$ until we get a result in the desired range.\n$$x \\equiv -1 + 12 \\pmod{12}$$\n$$x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{12}$$\nThe unique integer $x$ in the range $0 \\le x < 12$ that satisfies this congruence is $11$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the substitution method.\nFrom $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we can write $x = 4k + 3$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting this expression into the second congruence, $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$:\n$$4k + 3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$$\nReducing the coefficients modulo $3$: $4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n$$(1)k + 0 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$$\n$$k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$$\nThis implies that $k$ must be of the form $k = 3j + 2$ for some integer $j$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $x$:\n$$x = 4(3j + 2) + 3$$\n$$x = 12j + 8 + 3$$\n$$x = 12j + 11$$\nThis result, $x = 12j + 11$, means $x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{12}$. For $j=0$, we find the particular solution $x=11$, which lies in the required range $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 11\\}$.\nBoth methods yield the same unique representative.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "3090511"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall in mathematics is applying a theorem without first verifying its conditions.

An integer $m$ divides an integer $n$ if there exists an integer $q$ such that $n = mq$. In this case, there is no integer $q$ for which $4 = 6q$. Therefore, $6$ does not divide $4$.\n\nSince the condition fails, the linear Diophantine equation $12k - 18j = 4$ has no integer solutions for $k$ and $j$. This means there is no integer $x$ that can simultaneously satisfy both $x = 12k + 5$ and $x = 18j + 9$. Consequently, the original system of congruences has no integer solution.\n\nThe problem states that if no solution exists, we should report the integer $0$.\n\nAlternatively, a known theorem states that a system of congruences $x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{n_1}$ and $x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{n_2}$ has a solution if and only if $a_1 \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{\\operatorname{gcd}(n_1, n_2)}$.\nFor our system, this condition is $5 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{\\operatorname{gcd}(12, 18)}$.\nAs calculated before, $\\operatorname{gcd}(12, 18) = 6$.\nThe condition becomes $5 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{6}$.\nBy definition of congruence, this is true if and only if $6$ divides $(9-5)$, which is $4$.\nSince $6$ does not divide $4$, the condition is not met, and no solution exists.
