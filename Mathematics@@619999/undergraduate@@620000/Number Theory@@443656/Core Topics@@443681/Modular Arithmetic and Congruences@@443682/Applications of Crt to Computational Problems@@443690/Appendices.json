The moduli are $m_1 = 3$, $m_2 = 5$, and $m_3 = 7$. These are pairwise coprime integers. The product modulus is $M = m_1 m_2 m_3 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 105$. The solution is developed in three stages as prescribed.\n\n**1) Construction of the Numeric Reconstruction Blueprint**\n\nThe core of the constructive proof of the CRT is to find a set of integers $b_3, b_5, b_7$, where each $b_i$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $m_i$ and $0$ modulo $m_j$ for $j \\neq i$.\n\n- **Calculation of $b_3$**:\nWe require $b_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, $b_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, and $b_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. The latter two congruences imply that $b_3$ must be a multiple of the product $5 \\times 7 = 35$, as $5$ and $7$ are coprime. We can write $b_3 = 35k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the first congruence gives:\n$$35k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$$\nSince $35 = 11 \\times 3 + 2$, we have $35 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The congruence simplifies to:\n$$2k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$$\nTo solve for $k$, we find the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $3$. Finding such an inverse is guaranteed by Bézout's identity for the coprime integers $2$ and $3$. By inspection, we see that $2 \\times 2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so the inverse of $2$ modulo $3$ is $2$. Multiplying the congruence by $2$:\n$$2(2k) \\equiv 2(1) \\pmod{3} \\implies 4k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\implies k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$$\nWe select the smallest non-negative integer $k$, so $k=2$. This yields $b_3 = 35 \\times 2 = 70$. This value lies in the required range $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 104\\}$.\n\n- **Calculation of $b_5$**:\nWe require $b_5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $b_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, and $b_5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. This means $b_5$ must be a multiple of $3 \\times 7 = 21$. So, $b_5 = 21k$. Substituting into the second congruence:\n$$21k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\nSince $21 = 4 \\times 5 + 1$, we have $21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. The congruence becomes:\n$$k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\nChoosing $k=1$, we find $b_5 = 21 \\times 1 = 21$. This value is in the required range.\n\n- **Calculation of $b_7$**:\nWe require $b_7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $b_7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, and $b_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. This means $b_7$ must be a multiple of $3 \\times 5 = 15$. So, $b_7 = 15k$. Substituting into the third congruence:\n$$15k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\nSince $15 = 2 \\times 7 + 1$, we have $15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. The congruence becomes:\n$$k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\nChoosing $k=1$, we find $b_7 = 15 \\times 1 = 15$. This value is in the required range.\n\nThe resulting numeric reconstruction blueprint consists of the integers $b_3 = 70$, $b_5 = 21$, and $b_7 = 15$.\n\n**2) Reconstruction of $x$**\n\nWe are asked to find the unique integer $x \\in [0, 105)$ that satisfies the system of congruences:\n$$x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$$\n$$x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$$\nThe solution $x$ can be constructed as a linear combination of the blueprint integers $b_i$ weighted by the corresponding residues $r_i$:\n$$x = r_3 b_3 + r_5 b_5 + r_7 b_7$$\nAny such $x$ satisfies the congruences. For example, modulo $3$, $x \\equiv r_3(1) + r_5(0) + r_7(0) \\equiv r_3 \\pmod{3}$. The same logic applies to moduli $5$ and $7$.\nSubstituting the given residues $r_3 = 2$, $r_5 = 4$, $r_7 = 3$ and the calculated $b_i$ values:\n$$x' = (2)(70) + (4)(21) + (3)(15) = 140 + 84 + 45 = 269$$\nTo find the unique solution in the interval $[0, 105)$, we take the result modulo $105$:\n$$x \\equiv 269 \\pmod{105}$$\nSince $269 = 2 \\times 105 + 59$, the remainder is $59$.\nThus, the unique solution is $x = 59$.\n\n**3) Justification of Uniqueness**\n\nThe uniqueness of the solution in the interval $[0, M)$ is a cornerstone of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This can be justified from the foundational facts.\nLet's assume there exist two distinct solutions, $x_1$ and $x_2$, within the interval $[0, 105)$. Both solutions must satisfy the given congruences:\n$$x_1 \\equiv r_i \\pmod{m_i} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 \\equiv r_i \\pmod{m_i} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$$\nBy subtracting the congruences for $x_2$ from those for $x_1$, we get:\n$$x_1 - x_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$$\n$$x_1 - x_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$x_1 - x_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$$\nThese congruences mean that the difference $x_1 - x_2$ is a multiple of $3$, $5$, and $7$. Since $3$, $5$, and $7$ are pairwise coprime, their least common multiple is their product, $M=105$. Therefore, $x_1 - x_2$ must be a multiple of $105$. We can write this as:\n$$x_1 - x_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{105}$$\nSince both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in the interval $[0, 105)$, they satisfy $0 \\le x_1  105$ and $0 \\le x_2  105$. Their difference must therefore be in the range $-105  x_1 - x_2  105$. The only integer in this range that is a multiple of $105$ is $0$.\nHence, $x_1 - x_2 = 0$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$.\nThis contradicts the assumption that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are distinct solutions. Therefore, the solution in the interval $[0, 105)$ must be unique.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{59}$$", "id": "3081036"}, {"introduction": "This practice demonstrates the power of the CRT as a \"divide-and-conquer\" tool for more complex problems.

This procedure is then to be applied to a specific instance.\n\n**1. Derivation of the General Procedure**\n\nLet the given congruence be $x^{2}\\equiv a \\pmod{n}$. Since $n=pq$ and $p, q$ are distinct primes, they are coprime. By the definition of congruence, $n | (x^{2} - a)$, which implies $p | (x^{2} - a)$ and $q | (x^{2} - a)$. This is equivalent to the system of congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^{2} \\equiv a \\pmod{p} \\\\\nx^{2} \\equiv a \\pmod{q}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem states that $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo both $p$ and $q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are odd primes, and $a$ is a quadratic residue, the Legendre symbols $(\\frac{a}{p})$ and $(\\frac{a}{q})$ must both be equal to $1$. This implies that $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{q}$. Consequently, each of these quadratic congruences has exactly two distinct solutions.\n\nLet the solutions to $y^{2} \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ be $y \\equiv \\pm s_p \\pmod{p}$.\nLet the solutions to $z^{2} \\equiv a \\pmod{q}$ be $z \\equiv \\pm s_q \\pmod{q}$.\n\nThe problem of finding $x$ satisfying $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{n}$ is now reduced to finding $x$ that simultaneously satisfies one of the four possible pairs of linear congruences:\n$$\n\\text{System 1: } \\begin{cases} x \\equiv s_p \\pmod{p} \\\\ x \\equiv s_q \\pmod{q} \\end{cases}\n\\quad\n\\text{System 2: } \\begin{cases} x \\equiv s_p \\pmod{p} \\\\ x \\equiv -s_q \\pmod{q} \\end{cases}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{System 3: } \\begin{cases} x \\equiv -s_p \\pmod{p} \\\\ x \\equiv s_q \\pmod{q} \\end{cases}\n\\quad\n\\text{System 4: } \\begin{cases} x \\equiv -s_p \\pmod{p} \\\\ x \\equiv -s_q \\pmod{q} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) guarantees that for each of these systems, there exists a unique solution for $x$ modulo $n=pq$.\n\nTo construct these solutions, we first find integers $u$ and $v$ that satisfy Bézout's identity: $up + vq = 1$. This can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. From this identity, we have $vq \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $up \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$.\n\nFor a general system of the form $x \\equiv c_1 \\pmod{p}$ and $x \\equiv c_2 \\pmod{q}$, the solution is given by the formula:\n$$\nx \\equiv c_1(vq) + c_2(up) \\pmod{pq}\n$$\nWe verify this construction:\nModulo $p$: $x \\equiv c_1(vq) + c_2(up) \\equiv c_1(1) + c_2(0) \\equiv c_1 \\pmod{p}$.\nModulo $q$: $x \\equiv c_1(vq) + c_2(up) \\equiv c_1(0) + c_2(1) \\equiv c_2 \\pmod{q}$.\n\nApplying this construction to the four systems yields the four distinct solutions for $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{n}$.\n\n**2. Application to the Specific Instance**\n\nWe are given $p=11$, $q=19$, $n=pq=209$, and $a=5$. We must find all $x \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 208\\}$ such that $x^{2} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{209}$.\n\n**Step 2a: Solve for roots modulo $p=11$.**\nWe need to solve $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. Both $p=11$ and $q=19$ are primes congruent to $3 \\pmod{4}$. For such a prime $p$, the square roots of a quadratic residue $a$ are given by $\\pm a^{(p+1)/4} \\pmod{p}$.\nFor $p=11$, the exponent is $(11+1)/4 = 3$.\nSo, the roots are $\\pm 5^3 \\pmod{11}$.\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n$5^3 = 5 \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 3 = 15 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$.\nThus, $s_p = 4$. The two solutions are $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv -4 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Step 2b: Solve for roots modulo $q=19$.**\nWe need to solve $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$.\nFor $q=19$, the exponent is $(19+1)/4 = 5$.\nSo, the roots are $\\pm 5^5 \\pmod{19}$.\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{19}$.\n$5^4 \\equiv 6^2 = 36 \\equiv 17 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{19}$.\n$5^5 = 5 \\cdot 5^4 \\equiv 5 \\cdot (-2) = -10 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{19}$.\nThus, $s_q = 9$. The two solutions are $x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{19}$ and $x \\equiv -9 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{19}$.\n\n**Step 2c: Find coefficients for CRT.**\nWe must find integers $u, v$ such that $11u + 19v = 1$. Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n$19 = 1 \\cdot 11 + 8$\n$11 = 1 \\cdot 8 + 3$\n$8 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 2$\n$3 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1$\nWorking backwards:\n$1 = 3 - 1 \\cdot 2 = 3 - (8 - 2 \\cdot 3) = 3 \\cdot 3 - 8$\n$1 = 3(11 - 8) - 8 = 3 \\cdot 11 - 4 \\cdot 8$\n$1 = 3 \\cdot 11 - 4(19 - 1 \\cdot 11) = 3 \\cdot 11 - 4 \\cdot 19 + 4 \\cdot 11 = 7 \\cdot 11 - 4 \\cdot 19$.\nSo we have $u=7$ and $v=-4$.\nThe CRT lifting terms are $up = 7 \\cdot 11 = 77$ and $vq = -4 \\cdot 19 = -76$.\n\n**Step 2d: Construct the four solutions modulo $209$.**\nThe general solution form is $x \\equiv c_1(-76) + c_2(77) \\pmod{209}$, where $c_1$ is a root modulo $11$ and $c_2$ is a root modulo $19$.\n\nSystem 1: $c_1=4, c_2=9$.\n$x_1 \\equiv 4(-76) + 9(77) \\pmod{209}$\n$x_1 \\equiv -304 + 693 \\pmod{209}$\n$x_1 \\equiv (-209 - 95) + (3 \\cdot 209 + 66) \\pmod{209}$\n$x_1 \\equiv -95 + 66 = -29 \\equiv 180 \\pmod{209}$.\n\nSystem 2: $c_1=4, c_2=10$.\n$x_2 \\equiv 4(-76) + 10(77) \\pmod{209}$\n$x_2 \\equiv -304 + 770 \\pmod{209}$\n$x_2 \\equiv -95 + (3 \\cdot 209 + 143) \\pmod{209}$\n$x_2 \\equiv -95 + 143 = 48 \\pmod{209}$.\n\nSystem 3: $c_1=7, c_2=9$.\n$x_3 \\equiv 7(-76) + 9(77) \\pmod{209}$\n$x_3 \\equiv -532 + 693 \\pmod{209}$\n$x_3 \\equiv (-3 \\cdot 209 + 95) + 66 \\pmod{209}$\n$x_3 \\equiv 95 + 66 = 161 \\pmod{209}$.\nNote that $x_3 \\equiv -x_2 \\pmod{209}$ since the roots are $( -s_p, s_q )$ and $( s_p, -s_q )$ respectively.
