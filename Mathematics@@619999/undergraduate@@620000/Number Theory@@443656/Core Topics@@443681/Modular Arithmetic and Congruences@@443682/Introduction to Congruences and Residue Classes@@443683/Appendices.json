It is a well-posed question in elementary number theory, based on established definitions and algorithms. All necessary data are provided, and there are no scientific or logical contradictions.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the multiplicative inverse of the residue class of $a=3210$ in the ring of integers modulo $n=10007$. This requires us to find an integer $x$ such that $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. Let the integers be $a=3210$ and $n=10007$. We seek an integer $x$ satisfying the congruence $3210x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10007}$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition of congruence, $3210x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10007}$ is equivalent to the statement that $10007$ divides the difference $3210x - 1$. By the definition of divisibility, this means there exists an integer $k$ such that $3210x - 1 = 10007k$. Rearranging this equation, we get $3210x - 10007k = 1$. Let $y = -k$. The equation becomes $3210x + 10007y = 1$.\n\nThis is an instance of Bezout's identity. A solution $(x, y)$ in integers exists if and only if the greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(3210, 10007)$, is $1$. The extended Euclidean algorithm provides a constructive method for finding such integers $x$ and $y$ and simultaneously computing the GCD.\n\nFirst, we apply the Euclidean algorithm to find $\\gcd(10007, 3210)$.\n\\begin{align*} 10007 = 3 \\times 3210 + 377 \\\\ 3210 = 8 \\times 377 + 194 \\\\ 377 = 1 \\times 194 + 183 \\\\ 194 = 1 \\times 183 + 11 \\\\ 183 = 16 \\times 11 + 7 \\\\ 11 = 1 \\times 7 + 4 \\\\ 7 = 1 \\times 4 + 3 \\\\ 4 = 1 \\times 3 + 1 \\\\ 3 = 3 \\times 1 + 0 \\end{align*}\nThe last non-zero remainder is $1$, so $\\gcd(10007, 3210) = 1$. This confirms that a multiplicative inverse of $3210$ modulo $10007$ exists and is unique.\n\nNext, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm by working backward from the second-to-last equation of the algorithm to express the GCD, $1$, as a linear combination of $10007$ and $3210$.\n\\begin{align*} 1 = 4 - 1 \\times 3 \\\\ = 4 - 1 \\times (7 - 1 \\times 4) \\\\ = 1 \\times 4 - 1 \\times 7 + 1 \\times 4 = 2 \\times 4 - 1 \\times 7 \\\\ = 2 \\times (11 - 1 \\times 7) - 1 \\times 7 \\\\ = 2 \\times 11 - 2 \\times 7 - 1 \\times 7 = 2 \\times 11 - 3 \\times 7 \\\\ = 2 \\times 11 - 3 \\times (183 - 16 \\times 11) \\\\ = 2 \\times 11 - 3 \\times 183 + 48 \\times 11 = 50 \\times 11 - 3 \\times 183 \\\\ = 50 \\times (194 - 1 \\times 183) - 3 \\times 183 \\\\ = 50 \\times 194 - 50 \\times 183 - 3 \\times 183 = 50 \\times 194 - 53 \\times 183 \\\\ = 50 \\times 194 - 53 \\times (377 - 1 \\times 194) \\\\ = 50 \\times 194 - 53 \\times 377 + 53 \\times 194 = 103 \\times 194 - 53 \\times 377 \\\\ = 103 \\times (3210 - 8 \\times 377) - 53 \\times 377 \\\\ = 103 \\times 3210 - 824 \\times 377 - 53 \\times 377 = 103 \\times 3210 - 877 \\times 377 \\\\ = 103 \\times 3210 - 877 \\times (10007 - 3 \\times 3210) \\\\ = 103 \\times 3210 - 877 \\times 10007 + 2631 \\times 3210 \\\\ = (103 + 2631) \\times 3210 - 877 \\times 10007 \\\\ = 2734 \\times 3210 - 877 \\times 10007 \\end{align*}\nSo we have established the identity $2734 \\times 3210 - 877 \\times 10007 = 1$.\nTaking this equation modulo $10007$, we get:\n$$ (2734 \\times 3210) - (877 \\times 10007) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10007} $$\nSince $877 \\times 10007$ is a multiple of $10007$, its residue is $0$.\n$$ (2734 \\times 3210) - 0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10007} $$\n$$ 2734 \\times 3210 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10007} $$\nThis shows that $x=2734$ is the multiplicative inverse of $3210$ modulo $10007$.

The CRT states that if we have a system of congruences $x \\equiv c_i \\pmod{m_i}$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots, k$, where the moduli $m_i$ are pairwise coprime (i.e., $\\gcd(m_i, m_j) = 1$ for $i \\neq j$), then there exists a unique solution for $x$ modulo $M = m_1 m_2 \\cdots m_k$.\n\nIn this problem, the modulus is $n = 10800 = 16 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 25$. The factors $m_1=16=2^4$, $m_2=27=3^3$, and $m_3=25=5^2$ are powers of distinct primes, and are therefore pairwise coprime.

This allows us to use Euler's totient theorem. Euler's theorem states that if $\\gcd(b, m) = 1$, then $b^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$, where $\\phi(m)$ is Euler's totient function. This allows for the exponent to be reduced modulo $\\phi(m)$.\nFor the modulus $m=16=2^4$, the totient function is $\\phi(16) = 16(1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = 16 - 8 = 8$.\nNow, we reduce the exponent, $e=2025$, modulo $\\phi(16)=8$.\n$2025 = 8 \\times 253 + 1$.\nSo, $2025 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.\nApplying this to our congruence:\n$9^{2025} \\equiv 9^{8 \\times 253 + 1} \\equiv (9^{8})^{253} \\cdot 9^{1} \\pmod{16}$.\nBy Euler's theorem, $9^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$.\nTherefore, $x \\equiv 1^{253} \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{16}$.\nThe first congruence is $x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{16}$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the residue modulo $27$.**\nWe need to find $x \\equiv 12345^{2025} \\pmod{27}$.\nFirst, reduce the base, $a=12345$, modulo $27$.\n$12345 = 27 \\times 457 + 6$.\nSo, $12345 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{27}$.\nThe congruence becomes $x \\equiv 6^{2025} \\pmod{27}$.\nHere, the base $6$ and the modulus $27$ are not coprime: $\\gcd(6, 27) = 3$. We cannot directly apply Euler's theorem.\nWe must analyze the structure of the base and modulus. The modulus is $27=3^3$. The base is $6=2 \\cdot 3$.\nWe have $x \\equiv (2 \\cdot 3)^{2025} \\equiv 2^{2025} \\cdot 3^{2025} \\pmod{27}$.\nThe validity of this computation relies on the property that if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ and $c \\equiv d \\pmod{m}$, then $ac \\equiv bd \\pmod{m}$. Here we are investigating the term $3^{2025}$.\nThe modulus is a power of a prime, $p^k = 3^3$. The base contains this prime, $6=2 \\cdot 3^1$. In general, for a congruence of the form $(c \\cdot p^j)^e \\pmod{p^k}$ with $j \\ge 1$, we examine the resulting power of $p$, which is $p^{je}$. If $je \\ge k$, then $p^k$ divides $p^{je}$, which implies $p^{je} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$, and consequently $(c \\cdot p^j)^e \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$.\nIn our case, $p=3$, $k=3$, $j=1$, and $e=2025$. The condition is $j \\cdot e = 1 \\cdot 2025 = 2025 \\ge 3 = k$. The condition holds.\nThus, $3^{2025}$ contains a factor of $3^3=27$.\nSo, $3^{2025} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{27}$.\nThis results in $x \\equiv 2^{2025} \\cdot 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{27}$.\nThe second congruence is $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the residue modulo $25$.**\nWe need to find $x \\equiv 12345^{2025} \\pmod{25}$.\nFirst, reduce the base, $a=12345$, modulo $25$. Since $12300$ is a multiple of $100$ and thus of $25$, we have $12345 \\equiv 45 \\equiv 20 \\pmod{25}$.\nThe congruence is $x \\equiv 20^{2025} \\pmod{25}$.\nThe base $20$ and modulus $25$ are not coprime: $\\gcd(20, 25) = 5$. Again, Euler's theorem is not directly applicable.\nWe use the same reasoning as in Step 2. The modulus is $25=5^2$. The base is $20=4 \\cdot 5 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$.\nWe have $x \\equiv (4 \\cdot 5)^{2025} \\equiv 4^{2025} \\cdot 5^{2025} \\pmod{25}$.\nHere $p=5$, $k=2$, $j=1$, and $e=2025$. We check if $je \\ge k$: $1 \\cdot 2025 = 2025 \\ge 2 = k$. The condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, $5^{2025}$ contains a factor of $5^2=25$, meaning $5^{2025} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThis implies $x \\equiv 4^{2025} \\cdot 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThe third congruence is $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\n\n**Step 4: Recombine the results using the CRT.**\nWe have the system of congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx \\equiv 9 \\pmod{16} \\\\\nx \\equiv 0 \\pmod{27} \\\\\nx \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe second and third congruences, $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{27}$ and $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, imply that $x$ is a multiple of both $27$ and $25$. Since $\\gcd(27, 25) = 1$, $x$ must be a multiple of their product, $27 \\cdot 25 = 675$.\nSo, we can write $x = 675k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow, we substitute this into the first congruence:\n$675k \\equiv 9 \\pmod{16}$.\nTo solve for $k$, we first reduce the coefficient $675$ modulo $16$.\n$675 = 16 \\times 42 + 3$.\nSo, $675 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{16}$.\nThe congruence for $k$ becomes $3k \\equiv 9 \\pmod{16}$.\nSince $\\gcd(3, 16)=1$, we can legally divide both sides by $3$. To do this formally, we multiply by the modular inverse of $3$ modulo $16$. The inverse of $3$ is $11$ since $3 \\cdot 11 = 33 = 2 \\cdot 16 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$.\nMultiplying by $11$:\n$11 \\cdot (3k) \\equiv 11 \\cdot 9 \\pmod{16}$\n$1k \\equiv 99 \\pmod{16}$.\nNow we reduce $99$ modulo $16$:\n$99 = 16 \\times 6 + 3$.\nSo, $k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{16}$.\n\nThis means that $k$ must be of the form $k = 16j + 3$ for some integer $j$.\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $x$:\n$x = 675k = 675(16j + 3)$.\n$x = 675 \\cdot 16j + 675 \\cdot 3$.\nThe product $675 \\cdot 16 = (27 \\cdot 25) \\cdot 16 = 27 \\cdot 400 = 10800$.\nSo, $x = 10800j + 675 \\cdot 3$.\nThis is equivalent to $x \\equiv 675 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{10800}$.\n$675 \\cdot 3 = 2025$.\nSo, $x \\equiv 2025 \\pmod{10800}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the least nonnegative residue, which is the unique solution $x$ in the range $0 \\le x  10800$.\nThe solution is $x=2025$. The CRT guarantees that this solution is unique modulo $10800$. If there were two solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$, they would both satisfy the system, implying $x_1-x_2$ is divisible by $16$, $27$, and $25$. Since these moduli are pairwise coprime, $x_1-x_2$ must be divisible by their product $10800$.

Since $\\omega(n)$ is a non-negative integer (e.g., $\\omega(1)=0$, $\\omega(p)=1$, $\\omega(p_1p_2)=2$), the number of idempotents must be a power of $2$, such as $1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots$. The number $3$ is not a power of $2$. Therefore, it is impossible for any ring $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ to have exactly $3$ idempotent elements.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In $\\mathbb{Z}/60\\mathbb{Z}$ there are exactly $8$ idempotents, and the residue class of $45$ is one of them.**\nThis statement has two claims. First, we find the number of idempotents in $\\mathbb{Z}/60\\mathbb{Z}$. The prime factorization of $n=60$ is $60 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1$. The distinct prime factors are $2$, $3$, and $5$. Thus, $\\omega(60) = 3$. The total number of idempotents is $2^{\\omega(60)} = 2^3 = 8$. The first claim is correct.\nSecond, we must verify if $45$ is an idempotent in $\\mathbb{Z}/60\\mathbb{Z}$. We check if $45^2 \\equiv 45 \\pmod{60}$. We compute $45^2 = 2025$. Dividing $2025$ by $60$ gives $2025 = 33 \\times 60 + 45$. Thus, $2025 \\equiv 45 \\pmod{60}$, so the residue class of $45$ is indeed an idempotent. Both claims are true.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If $e \\in \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is a nonzero idempotent, then $e$ is a unit (that is, $e$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$).**\nLet $e$ be an idempotent element, so $e^2 = e$. If we also assume $e$ is a unit, then there exists an inverse $e^{-1}$ such that $e \\cdot e^{-1} = 1$. We can multiply the idempotent equation by this inverse:\n$e^{-1} \\cdot e^2 = e^{-1} \\cdot e$\n$(e^{-1} \\cdot e) \\cdot e = 1$\n$1 \\cdot e = 1$\n$e = 1$.\nThis proves that the only idempotent element that is also a unit is the multiplicative identity, $1$. The statement claims that *any* nonzero idempotent is a unit. This would only be true if $1$ were the only nonzero idempotent. However, whenever $\\omega(n) \\ge 2$, there exist \"non-trivial\" idempotents (those other than $0$ and $1$).\nFor a specific counterexample, let $n=6$. The prime factorization is $6 = 2 \\times 3$, so $\\omega(6)=2$, and there are $2^2=4$ idempotents. By inspection or by solving $e(e-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$, we find the idempotents are $0, 1, 3, 4$. Consider the element $e=3$. It is a nonzero idempotent because $3^2 = 9 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$. An element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is a unit if and only if $\\gcd(a,n)=1$. For $e=3$ and $n=6$, we have $\\gcd(3,6)=3 \\neq 1$, so $3$ is not a unit. This counterexample disproves the statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "3086270"}]}
