It is a well-posed problem in elementary number theory, free of scientific or factual unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradictions. All necessary data and conditions are provided.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of four residues, contrasting the behavior of exponentiation modulo a prime $p$ with that modulo a composite number $m$. We are given $x=5$, $y=7$, the prime $p=13$, and the composite modulus $m=12$.\n\n### Part 1: Prime Modulus Case ($p=13$)\n\nThe problem requires a justification based on the binomial theorem and properties of binomial coefficients for a prime modulus. Let $p$ be a prime number. The binomial expansion of $(x+y)^p$ is:\n$$(x+y)^p = \\sum_{k=0}^{p} \\binom{p}{k} x^{p-k} y^k$$\nExpanding this sum, we get:\n$$(x+y)^p = \\binom{p}{0}x^p y^0 + \\binom{p}{1}x^{p-1}y^1 + \\dots + \\binom{p}{p-1}x^1 y^{p-1} + \\binom{p}{p}x^0 y^p$$\nThe terminal binomial coefficients are $\\binom{p}{0} = 1$ and $\\binom{p}{p} = 1$. The expression becomes:\n$$(x+y)^p = x^p + y^p + \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\binom{p}{k} x^{p-k} y^k$$\nAs stated in the problem, for a prime $p$, each binomial coefficient $\\binom{p}{k}$ is divisible by $p$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq p-1$. This means $\\binom{p}{k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ for these values of $k$. Consequently, every term in the summation $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\binom{p}{k} x^{p-k} y^k$ is a multiple of $p$. Therefore, the sum itself is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\binom{p}{k} x^{p-k} y^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\nTaking the entire expansion modulo $p$, we establish the identity known as the \"Freshman's Dream\":\n$$(x+y)^p \\equiv x^p + y^p \\pmod{p}$$\n\nNow we apply this to the specific numerical instance.\n\n**1. Residue of $(x+y)^p$ modulo $p$ ($r_1$)**\n\nWe need to compute $(5+7)^{13} \\pmod{13}$.\nThis is $12^{13} \\pmod{13}$.\nWe are given Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer $a$ and prime $p$, $a^p \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$.\nLetting $a = 12$ and $p = 13$, we have:\n$$12^{13} \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$$\nThus, the first residue is $r_1 = 12$.\n\n**2. Residue of $x^p + y^p$ modulo $p$ ($r_2$)**\n\nWe need to compute $5^{13} + 7^{13} \\pmod{13}$.\nApplying Fermat's Little Theorem to each term:\n- For $a=5$, $p=13$: $5^{13} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{13}$.\n- For $a=7$, $p=13$: $7^{13} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{13}$.\nTherefore,\n$$5^{13} + 7^{13} \\equiv 5 + 7 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$5^{13} + 7^{13} \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$$\nThus, the second residue is $r_2 = 12$.\nAs expected from our initial derivation, $r_1 = r_2$.\n\n### Part 2: Composite Modulus Case ($m=12$)\n\nThis part illustrates why the \"Freshman's Dream\" identity fails for composite moduli. We are given $m=12$.\n\n**3. Residue of $(x+y)^m$ modulo $m$ ($r_3$)**\n\nWe need to compute $(5+7)^{12} \\pmod{12}$.\nThis is $12^{12} \\pmod{12}$.\nSince $12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, and the exponent $12$ is a positive integer, we have:\n$$12^{12} \\equiv 0^{12} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$$\nThus, the third residue is $r_3 = 0$.\n\n**4. Residue of $x^m + y^m$ modulo $m$ ($r_4$)**\n\nWe need to compute $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\pmod{12}$.\nThe problem directs us to use tools such as the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and Euler's theorem. We will compute the residue modulo the prime power factors of $12$, which are $3$ and $4$.\n\n**Calculation modulo 3:**\nWe evaluate $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\pmod{3}$.\n$5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n$7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\nSo, $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\equiv 2^{12} + 1^{12} \\pmod{3}$.\n$1^{12} = 1$. For $2^{12}$, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem since $3$ is prime. $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ for $p \\nmid a$.\nHere, $2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nThen $2^{12} = (2^2)^6 \\equiv 1^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nSo, $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n**Calculation modulo 4:**\nWe evaluate $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\pmod{4}$.\n$5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n$7 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$\nSo, $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\equiv 1^{12} + (-1)^{12} \\pmod{4}$.\n$1^{12} = 1$ and $(-1)^{12} = 1$.\nSo, $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n**Combining with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\nLet $N = 5^{12} + 7^{12}$. We have the system of congruences:\n$$N \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$$\n$$N \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$$\nSince the value $2$ is a solution to both congruences, and by the uniqueness property of the CRT solution modulo $\\text{lcm}(3,4)=12$, we can immediately conclude that $N \\equiv 2 \\pmod{12}$.\nThus, the fourth residue is $r_4 = 2$.\n\nAlternatively, one could use Euler's totient theorem. $\\phi(12) = 12(1-\\frac{1}{2})(1-\\frac{1}{3}) = 12(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{2}{3}) = 4$. For any integer $a$ coprime to $12$, $a^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$.\nSince $\\gcd(5,12)=1$, $5^{12} = (5^4)^3 \\equiv 1^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$.\nAlso, $\\gcd(7,12)=1$, but we can find a smaller exponent: $7^2 = 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$. So $7^{12}=(7^2)^6 \\equiv 1^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$.\nTherefore, $5^{12} + 7^{12} \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{12}$, confirming $r_4=2$.\n\nNotice that $r_3 = 0$ and $r_4 = 2$, so $(x+y)^m \\not\\equiv x^m+y^m \\pmod m$ for this composite modulus.\n\n### Summary of Residues\n- $r_1 = (5+7)^{13} \\pmod{13} = 12$.\n- $r_2 = 5^{13}+7^{13} \\pmod{13} = 12$.\n- $r_3 = (5+7)^{12} \\pmod{12} = 0$.\n- $r_4 = 5^{12}+7^{12} \\pmod{12} = 2$.\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n12 & 12 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3085236"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall in mathematics is over-generalizing a powerful result.

The primary tool will be the Binomial Theorem, which states that for any integer $n \\ge 0$, $(x+y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the general case.

Since $p^3$ is divisible by $p^2$, this term is congruent to $0$ modulo $p^2$.\nFor any term with $k \\ge 2$, the term is $\\binom{p^2}{k}p^k$. Since $k \\ge 2$, the factor $p^k$ is divisible by $p^2$ (as $p \\ge 2$). Therefore, every term for $k \\ge 2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p^2$.\nSumming the terms modulo $p^2$:\n$$a^{p^2} = (1+p)^{p^2} \\equiv 1 + 0 + 0 + \\dots \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^2}$$\nNow, we must compare this result with $a \\pmod{p^2}$.\n$$a = 1+p$$\nThe congruence $a^{p^2} \\equiv a \\pmod{p^2}$ would thus require $1 \\equiv 1+p \\pmod{p^2}$.\nAccording to the definition of congruence, this would mean that $p^2$ divides $(1+p)-1$, which simplifies to $p^2 | p$. This is false for any prime number $p$.\nTherefore, the statement $a^{p^2} \\equiv a \\pmod{p^2}$ is false for $a=1+p$.\n\nSince the premise $a^p \\equiv a \\pmod p$ is always true for this setup, while the conclusion $a^{p^2} \\equiv a \\pmod{p^2}$ is always false, the implication (premise $\\implies$ conclusion) is false. Thus, the first congruence does not logically force the second.\n\nPart 2: Explicit computation for $p=11$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the residue of $12^{121}$ modulo $121$.\nHere, $p=11$, so $a = 1+p = 1+11=12$, and the modulus is $p^2 = 11^2 = 121$. We need to find the unique integer $r$ in the range $0 \\le r \\le 120$ such that $12^{121} \\equiv r \\pmod{121}$.\nThis is a specific instance of the general case analyzed above, where we need to compute $(1+p)^{p^2} \\pmod{p^2}$.\nWe apply the Binomial Theorem to $(1+11)^{121}$:\n$$12^{121} = (1+11)^{121} = \\sum_{k=0}^{121} \\binom{121}{k} 11^k$$\n$$12^{121} = \\binom{121}{0}11^0 + \\binom{121}{1}11^1 + \\binom{121}{2}11^2 + \\dots + \\binom{121}{121}11^{121}$$\nWe evaluate the sum modulo $121 = 11^2$:\nThe first term ($k=0$) is $\\binom{121}{0}11^0 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThe second term ($k=1$) is $\\binom{121}{1}11^1 = 121 \\cdot 11 = 11^2 \\cdot 11 = 11^3$.

This term includes a factor of $11^2$, so it is congruent to $0$ modulo $121$.\nFor any integer $k \\ge 2$, the term $\\binom{121}{k}11^k$ contains a factor of $11^k$. Since $k \\ge 2$, $11^k$ is divisible by $11^2=121$.
