Thus, congruence (1) implies congruence (3), making (3) redundant.\nIf $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$, then $x = 9j + 1$ for some integer $j$. This implies $x = 3(3j) + 1$, so $x$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$, which means $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.

The modulus is $N=77$, which has the prime factorization $77 = 7 \\times 11$. Since the factors $7$ and $11$ are distinct primes, they are coprime. Therefore, the single congruence $x^{2} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{77}$ is equivalent to the system of two congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{7} \\\\\nx^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe solve each congruence in the system separately.\n\nFor the first congruence, $x^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{7}$, we invoke the definition of congruence: $m$ divides $a-b$ if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$. This means $7$ must divide $x^2 - 9$. Factoring the difference of squares, we have $x^2 - 9 = (x-3)(x+3)$. Thus, we have the condition $7 | (x-3)(x+3)$. Since $7$ is a prime number, Euclid's lemma states that if a prime divides a product of two integers, it must divide at least one of those integers. Consequently, either $7 | (x-3)$ or $7 | (x+3)$.\nCase 1: $7 | (x-3)$, which implies $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\nCase 2: $7 | (x+3)$, which implies $x \\equiv -3 \\pmod{7}$. Since $-3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, this gives $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\nSo, the solutions to the first congruence are $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ and $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nFor the second congruence, $x^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$, we apply the same reasoning. The condition $x^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$ implies that $11$ divides $x^2 - 9 = (x-3)(x+3)$. As $11$ is a prime number, it must be that $11 | (x-3)$ or $11 | (x+3)$.\nCase 1: $11 | (x-3)$, which implies $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\nCase 2: $11 | (x+3)$, which implies $x \\equiv -3 \\pmod{11}$. Since $-3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$, this gives $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$.\nSo, the solutions to the second congruence are $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nTo find the solutions for $x \\pmod{77}$, we must combine the solutions from the two modular systems in all possible ways.

Thus, $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{77}$. This gives the most obvious solution.\n\nSystem 2: $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ and $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$.\nFrom $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, we can write $x = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second congruence:\n$7k+3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11} \\implies 7k \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\nTo solve for $k$, we need the multiplicative inverse of $7$ modulo $11$. We seek an integer $y$ such that $7y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. We can see that $7 \\times 8 = 56 = 5 \\times 11 + 1$, so $y=8$. Multiplying the congruence by $8$:\n$8(7k) \\equiv 8(5) \\pmod{11} \\implies k \\equiv 40 \\pmod{11} \\implies k \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$.\nSo, $k$ can be written as $k=11j+7$ for some integer $j$. Substituting back into the expression for $x$:\n$x = 7(11j+7)+3 = 77j + 49 + 3 = 77j + 52$.\nTherefore, $x \\equiv 52 \\pmod{77}$.\n\nSystem 3: $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ and $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\nFrom $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, we write $x = 7k+4$.

Substituting back:\n$x = 7(11j+3)+4 = 77j + 21 + 4 = 77j + 25$.\nTherefore, $x \\equiv 25 \\pmod{77}$.\n\nSystem 4: $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ and $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$.\nFrom $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, we have $x = 7k+4$. Substituting into the second congruence:\n$7k+4 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11} \\implies 7k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$.\nUsing the inverse $8$:\n$k \\equiv 8(4) \\pmod{11} \\implies k \\equiv 32 \\pmod{11} \\implies k \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$.\nSo, $k = 11j+10$. Substituting back:\n$x = 7(11j+10)+4 = 77j + 70 + 4 = 77j + 74$.\nTherefore, $x \\equiv 74 \\pmod{77}$.\n\nThe four solutions are the residue classes represented by $3$, $25$, $52$, and $74$ modulo $77$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that these four solutions are pairwise distinct modulo $77$. The Chinese remainder theorem establishes an isomorphism of rings between $\\mathbb{Z}_{77}$ and the direct product $\\mathbb{Z}_7 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{11}$. This means there is a one-to-one correspondence between an element $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{77}$ and the pair of residues $(x \\pmod{7}, x \\pmod{11}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.

This provides the required logical argument for their distinctness.\n\nThe complete set of solutions modulo $77$ is $\\{3, 25, 52, 74\\}$. Arranged in increasing order, they are $3, 25, 52, 74$.\nWe can verify one of the non-trivial solutions, e.g., $x=25$:\n$25^2 = 625$. Dividing by $77$, we get $625 = 8 \\times 77 + 9$. Thus, $25^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{77}$.\nAlso note that $52 \\equiv -25 \\pmod{77}$, so $52^2 \\equiv (-25)^2 = 25^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{77}$.\nAnd $74 \\equiv -3 \\pmod{77}$, so $74^2 \\equiv (-3)^2 = 9 \\pmod{77}$.
