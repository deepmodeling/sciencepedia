An integer $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $n$ is $1$, i.e., $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$.\n\nFirst, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to compute $\\gcd(425, 987)$.\nThe sequence of divisions is as follows:\n$$987 = 2 \\cdot 425 + 137$$\n$$425 = 3 \\cdot 137 + 14$$\n$$137 = 9 \\cdot 14 + 11$$\n$$14 = 1 \\cdot 11 + 3$$\n$$11 = 3 \\cdot 3 + 2$$\n$$3 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1$$\n$$2 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder in this sequence is $1$. Therefore, we have $\\gcd(425, 987) = 1$. Since the greatest common divisor is $1$, the integer $425$ is indeed invertible modulo $987$.\n\nNext, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers $u$ and $v$ such that $425u + 987v = 1$. We do this by working backwards from the steps of the Euclidean Algorithm, expressing the GCD ($1$) as a linear combination of the numbers from the preceding steps.\n\nStarting from the second to last line of the algorithm:\n$$1 = 3 - 1 \\cdot 2$$\nSubstitute for the remainder $2$ using the equation $11 = 3 \\cdot 3 + 2$, which gives $2 = 11 - 3 \\cdot 3$:\n$$1 = 3 - 1 \\cdot (11 - 3 \\cdot 3) = 3 - 1 \\cdot 11 + 3 \\cdot 3 = 4 \\cdot 3 - 1 \\cdot 11$$\nSubstitute for the remainder $3$ using the equation $14 = 1 \\cdot 11 + 3$, which gives $3 = 14 - 1 \\cdot 11$:\n$$1 = 4 \\cdot (14 - 1 \\cdot 11) - 1 \\cdot 11 = 4 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 11 - 1 \\cdot 11 = 4 \\cdot 14 - 5 \\cdot 11$$\nSubstitute for the remainder $11$ using the equation $137 = 9 \\cdot 14 + 11$, which gives $11 = 137 - 9 \\cdot 14$:\n$$1 = 4 \\cdot 14 - 5 \\cdot (137 - 9 \\cdot 14) = 4 \\cdot 14 - 5 \\cdot 137 + 45 \\cdot 14 = 49 \\cdot 14 - 5 \\cdot 137$$\nSubstitute for the remainder $14$ using the equation $425 = 3 \\cdot 137 + 14$, which gives $14 = 425 - 3 \\cdot 137$:\n$$1 = 49 \\cdot (425 - 3 \\cdot 137) - 5 \\cdot 137 = 49 \\cdot 425 - 147 \\cdot 137 - 5 \\cdot 137 = 49 \\cdot 425 - 152 \\cdot 137$$\nFinally, substitute for the remainder $137$ using the equation $987 = 2 \\cdot 425 + 137$, which gives $137 = 987 - 2 \\cdot 425$:\n$$1 = 49 \\cdot 425 - 152 \\cdot (987 - 2 \\cdot 425) = 49 \\cdot 425 - 152 \\cdot 987 + 304 \\cdot 425$$\nCombining the terms involving $425$, we get:\n$$1 = (49 + 304) \\cdot 425 - 152 \\cdot 987$$\n$$1 = 353 \\cdot 425 - 152 \\cdot 987$$\nThis equation is Bézout's identity for $a=425$ and $n=987$, with $u=353$ and $v=-152$.\n\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of $425$ modulo $987$, we consider this identity in the ring of integers modulo $987$:\n$$353 \\cdot 425 - 152 \\cdot 987 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{987}$$\nSince $152 \\cdot 987$ is a multiple of $987$, its residue modulo $987$ is $0$.\n$$353 \\cdot 425 - 0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{987}$$\n$$353 \\cdot 425 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{987}$$\nThis congruence relation shows that $x=353$ is the multiplicative inverse of $425$ modulo $987$.\n\nThe problem asks for the unique least non-negative residue $x$ in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 986\\}$.

Your reasoning must be grounded in the definitions of modular inverse, greatest common divisor, and integer linear combinations. The final answer must be a single number. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine if the integer $a=840$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n=1001$ and to compute it if it exists. The analysis must be based on first principles and use the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, let us establish the foundational definitions. An integer $x$ is a multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $n$ if the congruence $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ holds. By the definition of modular congruence, this is equivalent to stating that $ax - 1$ is a multiple of $n$. This means there exists some integer $k$ such that $ax - 1 = kn$. Rearranging this equation gives the linear Diophantine equation $ax - kn = 1$. Letting $y = -k$, we seek integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the equation $ax + ny = 1$.\n\nThe existence of integer solutions to such an equation is governed by a fundamental property related to the greatest common divisor (gcd). The greatest common divisor of two integers $a$ and $n$, denoted $d = \\gcd(a, n)$, is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $n$. A key result, often called Bézout's identity, states that the gcd, $d$, can be expressed as an integer linear combination of $a$ and $n$. That is, there exist integers $x'$ and $y'$ such that $ax' + ny' = d$. Furthermore, $d$ is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed in this form. Consequently, any linear combination $ax + ny$ must be a multiple of $d = \\gcd(a, n)$.\n\nCombining these principles, a multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $n$ exists if and only if the equation $ax + ny = 1$ has an integer solution. This is possible if and only if $1$ is a multiple of $d = \\gcd(a, n)$. Since $d$ is a positive integer, this condition simplifies to $d = 1$. Therefore, $a$ is invertible modulo $n$ if and only if $a$ and $n$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$.\n\nWe now use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of $a=840$ and $n=1001$. The algorithm proceeds through a sequence of divisions with remainder:\n$$1001 = 1 \\cdot 840 + 161$$\n$$840 = 5 \\cdot 161 + 35$$\n$$161 = 4 \\cdot 35 + 21$$\n$$35 = 1 \\cdot 21 + 14$$\n$$21 = 1 \\cdot 14 + 7$$\n$$14 = 2 \\cdot 7 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor. In this case, we find that $\\gcd(840, 1001) = 7$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(840, 1001) = 7 \\neq 1$, the integer $a=840$ does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo $n=1001$.\n\nThe structural obstruction is a direct consequence of the gcd. Any linear combination of $840$ and $1001$ must be a multiple of their gcd, which is $7$. To be explicit, since $7$ divides $840$ (i.e., $840 = 120 \\cdot 7$) and $7$ divides $1001$ (i.e., $1001 = 143 \\cdot 7$), any expression of the form $840x + 1001y$ for integers $x$ and $y$ can be factored as:\n$$840x + 1001y = (120 \\cdot 7)x + (143 \\cdot 7)y = 7(120x + 143y)$$\nThis shows that any integer that can be expressed as a linear combination of $840$ and $1001$ must be divisible by $7$. The integer $1$ is not divisible by $7$, so the equation $840x + 1001y = 1$ has no integer solutions. This directly implies that the congruence $840x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$ has no solution for $x$.\n\nThe problem states that if no inverse exists, we must report the value of $d = \\gcd(a, n)$.

The congruence is of the form $ax \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$.\n\n1. First, we determine the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $m$, which is $\\gcd(14, 35)$. We use the Euclidean algorithm:\n$$35 = 2 \\cdot 14 + 7$$\n$$14 = 2 \\cdot 7 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $7$, so $d = \\gcd(14, 35) = 7$.\nA linear congruence $ax \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ has solutions if and only if $d$ divides $b$. In this case, $d=7$ and $b=21$. Since $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$, $d$ divides $b$, and thus the congruence is solvable.\nTo reduce the congruence, we can use the definition $ax \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ is equivalent to $ax - b = mk$ for some integer $k$. For our specific problem, this is $14x - 21 = 35k$. We can divide this entire equation by $d=7$:\n$$(14/7)x - (21/7) = (35/7)k$$\n$$2x - 3 = 5k$$\nThis Diophantine equation is equivalent to the reduced congruence $2x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. The new modulus is $m' = m/d = 35/7 = 5$.\n\n2. Next, we solve the reduced congruence $2x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. To do this, we find the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $5$. Since $\\gcd(2, 5) = 1$, an inverse exists. We use the extended Euclidean algorithm (EEA). The Euclidean algorithm for $\\gcd(2, 5)$ is:\n$$5 = 2 \\cdot 2 + 1$$\nWe now express the $\\gcd$, which is $1$, as a linear combination of $5$ and $2$ by working backwards:\n$$1 = 5 - 2 \\cdot 2$$\n$$1 = (1) \\cdot 5 + (-2) \\cdot 2$$\nTaking this equation modulo $5$, we get:\n$$(1) \\cdot 5 + (-2) \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$0 + (-2) \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\nSo, the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $5$ is $-2$. The canonical representative in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ is $-2 + 5 = 3$. We can check that $2 \\cdot 3 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nNow, we multiply both sides of the reduced congruence $2x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$ by the inverse, $3$:\n$$3 \\cdot (2x) \\equiv 3 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$(3 \\cdot 2)x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$1 \\cdot x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$$\nThe canonical solution modulo the reduced modulus $5$ is $x_0 = 4$.\n\n3. The number of incongruent solutions to $ax \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ is given by $d = \\gcd(a, m)$, provided $d|b$. Here, $d=7$, so there are $7$ incongruent solutions modulo $35$.\nThe solution to the reduced congruence, $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, implies that any solution $x$ must satisfy the relation $x = 4 + 5k$ for some integer $k$. We now need to find which values of $k$ generate distinct solutions modulo $35$.\nLet's assume two solutions, $x_1 = 4 + 5k_1$ and $x_2 = 4 + 5k_2$, are congruent modulo $35$.\n$$4 + 5k_1 \\equiv 4 + 5k_2 \\pmod{35}$$\n$$5k_1 \\equiv 5k_2 \\pmod{35}$$\nBy the definition of congruence, this means $35 | (5k_1 - 5k_2)$, or $35 | 5(k_1 - k_2)$.\nThis implies that there is an integer $c$ such that $5(k_1 - k_2) = 35c$. Dividing by $5$, we get $k_1 - k_2 = 7c$, which means $7 | (k_1 - k_2)$, or $k_1 \\equiv k_2 \\pmod{7}$.\nTherefore, we obtain distinct solutions modulo $35$ by choosing values of $k$ that are incongruent modulo $7$. A complete set of representatives for $k$ modulo $7$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. This confirms there are exactly $7$ distinct solutions.\nThe full set of solutions is generated by \"lifting\" the base solution $x_0 = 4$ from the reduced modulus $5$ to the original modulus $35$. The general form of the solutions is $x_k = x_0 + k(m/d)$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, d-1$. In our case, this is $x_k = 4 + k(35/7) = 4 + 5k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n4.
