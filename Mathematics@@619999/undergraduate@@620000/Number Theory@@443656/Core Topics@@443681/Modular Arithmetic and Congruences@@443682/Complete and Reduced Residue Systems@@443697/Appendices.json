The givens are sufficient and consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for two main results: first, a derivation of Euler's totient function $\\varphi(n)$ for $n=2^{a}3^{b}5^{c}$ from first principles, and second, an explicit description of a reduced residue system modulo $n$. The final answer to be reported is the closed-form expression for $\\varphi(n)$.\n\nFirst, we address the determination of $\\varphi(n)$. The derivation proceeds in three steps: calculating $\\varphi(p^k)$ for a prime $p$, showing that $\\varphi$ is a multiplicative function, and combining these results to find $\\varphi(n)$.\n\nLet $p$ be a prime number and $k$ be a positive integer. By definition, $\\varphi(p^k)$ is the count of integers $r$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p^k\\}$ such that $\\gcd(r, p^k) = 1$. The condition $\\gcd(r, p^k) = 1$ is equivalent to the condition that $r$ is not divisible by $p$. To find $\\varphi(p^k)$, we can count the total number of integers in the range, which is $p^k$, and subtract the number of integers that are not relatively prime to $p^k$.\nAn integer $r$ in the given range is not relatively prime to $p^k$ if and only if $\\gcd(r, p^k) > 1$. Since $p$ is the only prime factor of $p^k$, this is equivalent to $r$ being a multiple of $p$. The multiples of $p$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p^k\\}$ are $1 \\cdot p, 2 \\cdot p, \\ldots, m \\cdot p$ such that $m \\cdot p \\leq p^k$. This inequality simplifies to $m \\leq p^{k-1}$. Thus, there are exactly $p^{k-1}$ such multiples of $p$ in the range.\nThe number of integers relatively prime to $p^k$ is the total number of integers minus those that are not.\n$$ \\varphi(p^k) = (\\text{total numbers}) - (\\text{numbers not coprime to } p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} $$\nThis can be factored as $\\varphi(p^k) = p^{k-1}(p-1)$ or $\\varphi(p^k) = p^k(1 - \\frac{1}{p})$.\n\nNext, we establish that $\\varphi$ is a multiplicative function. That is, for any two coprime positive integers $m_1$ and $m_2$, we have $\\varphi(m_1 m_2) = \\varphi(m_1)\\varphi(m_2)$. We use the structure of the ring of integers modulo $m_1 m_2$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $\\gcd(m_1, m_2) = 1$, there is a ring isomorphism\n$$ \\Psi: \\mathbb{Z}_{m_1 m_2} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{m_1} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{m_2} $$\ndefined by $\\Psi([x]_{m_1 m_2}) = ([x]_{m_1}, [x]_{m_2})$, where $[x]_k$ denotes the residue class of $x$ modulo $k$. An element $[x]_k$ is a unit in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ if and only if $\\gcd(x,k)=1$. The set of units in $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ is denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}_k)^\\times$, and its size is $|\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_k\\right)^\\times| = \\varphi(k)$.\nAn integer $x$ is relatively prime to the product $m_1 m_2$ if and only if it is relatively prime to both $m_1$ and $m_2$, because $m_1$ and $m_2$ share no prime factors.\n$$ \\gcd(x, m_1 m_2) = 1 \\iff \\gcd(x, m_1) = 1 \\text{ and } \\gcd(x, m_2) = 1 $$\nThis means that the ring isomorphism $\\Psi$ restricts to a group isomorphism between the groups of units:\n$$ \\Psi|_{(\\mathbb{Z}_{m_1 m_2})^\\times}: (\\mathbb{Z}_{m_1 m_2})^\\times \\to (\\mathbb{Z}_{m_1})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}_{m_2})^\\times $$\nSince this map is an isomorphism, it is a bijection. Therefore, the cardinality of the domain must equal the cardinality of the codomain.\n$$ |(\\mathbb{Z}_{m_1 m_2})^\\times| = |(\\mathbb{Z}_{m_1})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}_{m_2})^\\times| = |(\\mathbb{Z}_{m_1})^\\times| \\cdot |(\\mathbb{Z}_{m_2})^\\times| $$\nThis equality of cardinalities is precisely the statement $\\varphi(m_1 m_2) = \\varphi(m_1)\\varphi(m_2)$.\n\nNow we can compute $\\varphi(n)$ for $n = 2^a 3^b 5^c$. The integers $a, b, c$ are given to be positive. The factors $2^a, 3^b, 5^c$ are pairwise coprime. Applying the multiplicative property of $\\varphi$ repeatedly, we get:\n$$ \\varphi(n) = \\varphi(2^a 3^b 5^c) = \\varphi(2^a) \\varphi(3^b) \\varphi(5^c) $$\nUsing the formula for $\\varphi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$ derived earlier:\nFor $p=2, k=a$:\n$$ \\varphi(2^a) = 2^a - 2^{a-1} = 2^{a-1}(2-1) = 2^{a-1} $$\nFor $p=3, k=b$:\n$$ \\varphi(3^b) = 3^b - 3^{b-1} = 3^{b-1}(3-1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{b-1} $$\nFor $p=5, k=c$:\n$$ \\varphi(5^c) = 5^c - 5^{c-1} = 5^{c-1}(5-1) = 4 \\cdot 5^{c-1} = 2^2 \\cdot 5^{c-1} $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $\\varphi(n)$:\n$$ \\varphi(n) = (2^{a-1}) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^{b-1}) \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 5^{c-1}) $$\nCombining the powers of $2$:\n$$ \\varphi(n) = 2^{a-1+1+2} \\cdot 3^{b-1} \\cdot 5^{c-1} = 2^{a+2} \\cdot 3^{b-1} \\cdot 5^{c-1} $$\nThis is the explicit expression for $\\varphi(n)$ in terms of $a, b, c$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we describe an explicit reduced residue system modulo $n$. A reduced residue system modulo $n$ is a set of $\\varphi(n)$ integers, incongruent modulo $n$, each of which is relatively prime to $n$. As established in the proof of multiplicativity, an integer $r$ is relatively prime to $n=2^a 3^b 5^c$ if and only if it is relatively prime to each of $2^a$, $3^b$, and $5^c$. This means $r$ must satisfy:\n$ \\gcd(r, 2^a) = 1 $, i.e., $r$ is odd.\n$ \\gcd(r, 3^b) = 1 $, i.e., $r$ is not divisible by $3$.\n$ \\gcd(r, 5^c) = 1 $, i.e., $r$ is not divisible by $5$.\n\nBased on the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a complete reduced residue system modulo $n$ can be constructed. Let $R_{2^a}$, $R_{3^b}$, and $R_{5^c}$ be reduced residue systems modulo $2^a$, $3^b$, and $5^c$, respectively.\n$R_{2^a} = \\{r_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 1 \\le r_1 \\le 2^a, \\gcd(r_1, 2) = 1 \\}$. This is the set of all odd integers up to $2^a$.\n$R_{3^b} = \\{r_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 1 \\le r_2 \\le 3^b, \\gcd(r_2, 3) = 1 \\}$. This is the set of all integers up to $3^b$ not divisible by $3$.\n$R_{5^c} = \\{r_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 1 \\le r_3 \\le 5^c, \\gcd(r_3, 5) = 1 \\}$. This is the set of all integers up to $5^c$ not divisible by $5$.\n\nFor each triplet $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$ where $r_1 \\in R_{2^a}$, $r_2 \\in R_{3^b}$, and $r_3 \\in R_{5^c}$, there exists a unique solution $r$ modulo $n$ to the system of congruences:\n$$ r \\equiv r_1 \\pmod{2^a} $$\n$$ r \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{3^b} $$\n$$ r \\equiv r_3 \\pmod{5^c} $$\nThe set of all such unique solutions $r$ constitutes a complete reduced residue system modulo $n$. The number of such triplets is $\\varphi(2^a)\\varphi(3^b)\\varphi(5^c) = \\varphi(n)$, so this construction yields a set of the correct size. This provides a structural and explicit (though not enumerated) description of the reduced residue system as requested.\n\nThe final reportable answer is the closed-form expression for $\\varphi(n)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^{a+2} 3^{b-1} 5^{c-1}}$$", "id": "3083419"}, {"introduction": "Once we know how to determine the size of a reduced residue system, the next logical step is to construct one.

The reduced residue system modulo $8$ is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. There are $\\varphi(8) = 8 - 4 = 4$ such residues.\n- For modulus $3$: The reduced residue system is $\\{1, 2\\}$.

This confirms our calculation of $\\varphi(840)$.\n\nThe concrete specification for generating a reduced residue system modulo $840$ is as follows: The system consists of the set of unique integers $x$ in the range $1 \\le x \\le 840$ that are solutions to the systems of congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nx \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx \\equiv a_3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx \\equiv a_4 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere the tuple $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ is chosen from the Cartesian product of the individual reduced residue systems: $a_1 \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$, $a_2 \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, $a_3 \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, and $a_4 \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\nThis construction is valid for the following reasons:\n$1.$ (All are coprime to $840$): For any such solution $x$, the congruence $x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod 8$ with $\\gcd(a_1, 8)=1$ implies $x$ is odd, so $\\gcd(x, 8)=1$. Similarly, $x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod 3$ with $\\gcd(a_2, 3)=1$ implies $3 \\nmid x$, so $\\gcd(x, 3)=1$. This extends to all prime factors $2, 3, 5, 7$. Since $x$ is not divisible by any of the prime factors of $840$, we have $\\gcd(x, 840)=1$.\n\n$2.$ (Pairwise incongruent): The CRT guarantees that for each of the $192$ distinct tuples $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$, there exists a unique solution $x$ modulo $840$. If two tuples differ, they must differ in at least one component, say $a_i \\not\\equiv b_i \\pmod{n_i}$. Their respective solutions $x$ and $y$ would then be incongruent modulo $n_i$, and therefore incongruent modulo $840$. This ensures that our construction yields $192$ distinct residue classes modulo $840$.\n\n$3.$ (Completeness): The construction generates exactly $\\varphi(840)=192$ distinct congruence classes modulo $840$, each of which is relatively prime to $840$. Since there are precisely $\\varphi(840)$ such classes in total, this construction generates all of them. Any integer $k$ coprime to $840$ will define a tuple of residues $(k \\pmod 8, \\dots, k \\pmod 7)$ that is one of the $192$ valid tuples, and $k$ will be congruent to the unique solution generated by this tuple.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{192}$$", "id": "3083422"}, {"introduction": "A reduced residue system is more than just a set of numbers; it forms an abelian group under multiplication.
