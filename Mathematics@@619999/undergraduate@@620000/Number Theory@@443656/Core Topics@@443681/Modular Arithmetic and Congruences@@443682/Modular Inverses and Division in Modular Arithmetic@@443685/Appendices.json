The problem is well-posed and mathematically sound. A multiplicative inverse of an integer $a$ modulo $n$ exists if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $n$, denoted $\\gcd(a, n)$, is $1$. In this case, $a=37$ and $n=101$. Since $101$ is a prime number and $37$ is not a multiple of $101$ (as $1 < 37 < 101$), it follows that $\\gcd(37, 101) = 1$. Therefore, a unique multiplicative inverse of $37$ modulo $101$ exists.\n\nThe task is to find an integer $x$ such that:\n$$37x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$$\nThis congruence is equivalent to the existence of an integer $k$ such that $37x - 1 = 101k$. Rearranging this equation gives a linear Diophantine equation of the form specified by Bézout's identity:\n$$37x - 101k = 1$$\nWe can solve this for integers $x$ and $k$ using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA). Let's denote the equation as $37x + 101y = 1$, where $y = -k$. The EEA is applied to the pair $(101, 37)$.\n\nFirst, we perform the sequence of divisions for the Euclidean Algorithm:\n\\begin{align*} 101 &= 2 \\cdot 37 + 27 \\\\ 37 &= 1 \\cdot 27 + 10 \\\\ 27 &= 2 \\cdot 10 + 7 \\\\ 10 &= 1 \\cdot 7 + 3 \\\\ 7 &= 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\\\ 3 &= 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\end{align*}\nThe last non-zero remainder is $1$, which confirms that $\\gcd(101, 37)=1$.\n\nNext, we work backwards through these equations to express the gcd, $1$, as a linear combination of $101$ and $37$.\nStarting from the second to last equation, we have:\n$$1 = 7 - 2 \\cdot 3$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the remainder $3$ from the preceding equation ($3 = 10 - 1 \\cdot 7$):\n$$1 = 7 - 2 \\cdot (10 - 1 \\cdot 7) = 7 - 2 \\cdot 10 + 2 \\cdot 7 = 3 \\cdot 7 - 2 \\cdot 10$$\nNext, substitute the expression for the remainder $7$ ($7 = 27 - 2 \\cdot 10$):\n$$1 = 3 \\cdot (27 - 2 \\cdot 10) - 2 \\cdot 10 = 3 \\cdot 27 - 6 \\cdot 10 - 2 \\cdot 10 = 3 \\cdot 27 - 8 \\cdot 10$$\nNext, substitute the expression for the remainder $10$ ($10 = 37 - 1 \\cdot 27$):\n$$1 = 3 \\cdot 27 - 8 \\cdot (37 - 1 \\cdot 27) = 3 \\cdot 27 - 8 \\cdot 37 + 8 \\cdot 27 = 11 \\cdot 27 - 8 \\cdot 37$$\nFinally, substitute the expression for the remainder $27$ ($27 = 101 - 2 \\cdot 37$):\n$$1 = 11 \\cdot (101 - 2 \\cdot 37) - 8 \\cdot 37 = 11 \\cdot 101 - 22 \\cdot 37 - 8 \\cdot 37$$\nCombining the terms with $37$, we get:\n$$1 = 11 \\cdot 101 - 30 \\cdot 37$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$(-30) \\cdot 37 + (11) \\cdot 101 = 1$$\nThis equation is of the form $ax + ny = \\gcd(a,n)$ with $a=37$, $n=101$, $x=-30$, and $y=11$. Taking this equation modulo $101$:\n$$(-30) \\cdot 37 + (11) \\cdot 101 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$$\nSince $(11) \\cdot 101$ is a multiple of $101$, its remainder is $0$ modulo $101$.\n$$(-30) \\cdot 37 + 0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$$\n$$(-30) \\cdot 37 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$$\nThis shows that $x = -30$ is a valid multiplicative inverse of $37$ modulo $101$. The problem requires the least positive residue for $x$. To find this, we add the modulus $101$ to $-30$:\n$$x \\equiv -30 \\pmod{101} \\implies x \\equiv -30 + 101 \\pmod{101} \\implies x \\equiv 71 \\pmod{101}$$\nThe least positive integer value for $x$ is $71$.\n\nFinally, we must verify this result by direct reduction of the product $37x$ modulo $101$. We compute the product $37 \\cdot 71$:\n$$37 \\cdot 71 = 2627$$\nTo find the remainder of $2627$ when divided by $101$, we perform the division:\n$$2627 = 101 \\cdot q + r, \\quad \\text{where } 0 \\le r  101$$\nWe can calculate the quotient $q$: $q = \\lfloor \\frac{2627}{101} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 26.009... \\rfloor = 26$.\nNow, we find the remainder $r$:\n$$2627 = 101 \\cdot 26 + r$$\n$$2627 = 2626 + r$$\n$$r = 1$$\nThus, $2627 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$, which means $37 \\cdot 71 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$.

We are given $a=18$, $b=30$, and $n=42$. The analysis is to be conducted from first principles, utilizing the definition of congruence, properties of divisibility, the Euclidean algorithm, and Bézout's identity.\n\nFirst, we determine $d = \\gcd(a, n) = \\gcd(18, 42)$. We apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n$$42 = 2 \\cdot 18 + 6$$\n$$18 = 3 \\cdot 6 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor. Thus, we have $d = \\gcd(18, 42) = 6$.\n\nNext, we analyze the existence of solutions for the congruence $18x \\equiv 30 \\pmod{42}$. By the definition of congruence, this statement is equivalent to asserting that $n$ divides $(ax-b)$, which in this case means $42$ divides $(18x - 30)$. This implies the existence of an integer, let us call it $k$, such that:\n$$18x - 30 = 42k$$\nRearranging this equation gives a linear Diophantine equation in the variables $x$ and $k$:\n$$18x - 42k = 30$$\nA fundamental result in number theory states that a linear Diophantine equation of the form $Ax + By = C$ possesses integer solutions $(x, y)$ if and only if $\\gcd(A, B)$ divides $C$. In our context, $A=18$, $B=-42$, and $C=30$. The greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(18, -42) = \\gcd(18, 42) = 6$. The condition for the existence of solutions is that $6$ must divide $30$. Since $30 = 5 \\cdot 6$, this condition is satisfied, and we conclude that the congruence has solutions.\n\nTo find the solutions, we work with the equivalent Diophantine equation. We can divide the entire equation by $d=6$:\n$$\\frac{18}{6}x - \\frac{42}{6}k = \\frac{30}{6}$$\n$$3x - 7k = 5$$\nThis simplified equation is equivalent to the congruence $3x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$. To solve for $x$, we must find the multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $7$. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is an extension of the process used to find the GCD. From the steps $7 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 1$, we can express the GCD, $1$, as a linear combination of $7$ and $3$:\n$$1 = 7 - 2 \\cdot 3$$\nConsidering this equation modulo $7$, we have $1 \\equiv -2 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{7}$. Since $-2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, this becomes $1 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $7$ is $5$.\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the congruence $3x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$ by the inverse, $5$:\n$$5 \\cdot (3x) \\equiv 5 \\cdot 5 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$(5 \\cdot 3) x \\equiv 25 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$1 \\cdot x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$$\nThe last step follows from the fact that $25 = 3 \\cdot 7 + 4$.

The set of all solutions is therefore the arithmetic progression $\\{ \\dots, -10, -3, 4, 11, 18, \\dots \\}$, which is formally denoted by the set $4 + 7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe problem also asks for the distinct residue classes modulo $42$.
