That is, $\\varphi(n) = |\\{k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 1 \\leq k \\leq n, \\gcd(k,n)=1\\}|$.\n\nFirst, we compute $\\varphi(12)$ directly from the definition.

There are $4$ such integers. Thus, $\\varphi(12) = 4$.\n\nNext, we compute the products $\\varphi(3)\\varphi(4)$ and $\\varphi(2)\\varphi(6)$.\nTo compute $\\varphi(3)$: The integers $k$ with $1 \\leq k \\leq 3$ are $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.

This property is a direct consequence of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The CRT establishes a one-to-one correspondence (a ring isomorphism) between the ring of integers modulo $mn$, $\\mathbb{Z}_{mn}$, and the direct product of rings $\\mathbb{Z}_m \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n$, when $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$.\nAn integer $k$ is coprime to $mn$ if and only if $k$ is coprime to $m$ and $k$ is coprime to $n$. This means the isomorphism from the CRT restricts to a bijection between the group of units of $\\mathbb{Z}_{mn}$ (denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/mn\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$) and the direct product of the groups of units of $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ (i.e., $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$). The order of the group of units modulo $n$ is $\\varphi(n)$. Taking the cardinalities of these sets gives $|(\\mathbb{Z}/mn\\mathbb{Z})^\\times| = |(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times| \\cdot |(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^\\times|$, which translates to $\\varphi(mn) = \\varphi(m)\\varphi(n)$.\n\nCase 1: $m=3, n=4$. We have $\\gcd(3, 4) = 1$. The condition for multiplicativity is met. The theory predicts $\\varphi(3 \\cdot 4) = \\varphi(3)\\varphi(4)$. Our direct computation confirms this: $\\varphi(12) = 4$ and $\\varphi(3)\\varphi(4) = 4$. The equality holds.\n\nCase 2: $m=2, n=6$. We have $\\gcd(2, 6) = 2 \\neq 1$.

The calculation must start from the definition of $\\varphi(n)$ and elementary principles, justifying all properties used. Specifically, pre-derived formulas for $\\varphi(n)$ are forbidden, but the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) may be used after being stated.\n\nThe definition of the Euler totient function is given for a positive integer $n$ as the number of integers $a$ such that $1 \\leq a \\leq n$ and $\\gcd(a,n)=1$.\n\nTo compute $\\varphi(360)$, we first need to establish two key properties of $\\varphi(n)$ using only the provided definition and elementary counting principles.\n\nFirst, we will establish that $\\varphi(n)$ is a multiplicative function. A function $f$ is multiplicative if for any two coprime integers $m$ and $n$ (i.e., $\\gcd(m,n)=1$), it satisfies $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$.\n\nTo justify this property for $\\varphi(n)$, we invoke the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), as permitted.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if $m$ and $n$ are coprime positive integers, then for any pair of integers $(a, b)$, the system of simultaneous congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx \\equiv a \\pmod{m} \\\\\nx \\equiv b \\pmod{n}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nhas a unique solution for $x$ modulo $mn$.\nThis theorem establishes a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between integers $x$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, mn\\}$ and pairs of integers $(a, b)$ where $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$ and $b \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$. The mapping is given by $x \\mapsto (x \\pmod m, x \\pmod n)$.\n\nWe are interested in counting the integers $x$ such that $1 \\leq x \\leq mn$ and $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$. The condition $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$ holds if and only if $x$ is not divisible by any prime factor of $mn$. Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, their prime factors are distinct. Thus, $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$ is equivalent to the pair of conditions $\\gcd(x,m)=1$ and $\\gcd(x,n)=1$.\n\nLet $a = x \\pmod m$ and $b = x \\pmod n$. An elementary property of the greatest common divisor states that $\\gcd(x, m) = \\gcd(x \\pmod m, m) = \\gcd(a, m)$, and similarly $\\gcd(x, n) = \\gcd(x \\pmod n, n) = \\gcd(b, n)$.\nTherefore, the condition $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$ is equivalent to the pair of conditions $\\gcd(a, m)=1$ and $\\gcd(b, n)=1$.\n\nThis implies that the bijection established by the CRT restricts to a bijection between the set of integers $x \\in \\{1, \\dots, mn\\}$ coprime to $mn$ and the set of pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ is coprime to $m$ and $b \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is coprime to $n$.\n\nBy definition, the number of such integers $a$ is $\\varphi(m)$, and the number of such integers $b$ is $\\varphi(n)$. By the elementary principle of counting for Cartesian products (the rule of product), the total number of such pairs $(a, b)$ is the product $\\varphi(m)\\varphi(n)$.\nSince there is a bijection between the set of $x$'s we want to count and the set of pairs $(a,b)$, the sizes of these two sets must be equal. Therefore, we have justified that for $\\gcd(m,n)=1$,\n$$\n\\varphi(mn) = \\varphi(m)\\varphi(n)\n$$\n\nSecond, we need to find a way to compute $\\varphi(p^k)$ for a prime $p$ and an integer $k \\geq 1$.\nBy definition, $\\varphi(p^k)$ is the count of integers $a$ such that $1 \\leq a \\leq p^k$ and $\\gcd(a, p^k)=1$.\nThe condition $\\gcd(a, p^k)=1$ means that $a$ does not share any prime factors with $p^k$. Since the only prime factor of $p^k$ is $p$, this is equivalent to the condition that $a$ is not divisible by $p$.\n\nWe can find $\\varphi(p^k)$ by taking the total number of integers from $1$ to $p^k$, which is $p^k$, and subtracting the number of integers in this range that are *not* coprime to $p^k$. The integers not coprime to $p^k$ are precisely the multiples of $p$.\nThe multiples of $p$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p^k\\}$ are $p, 2p, 3p, \\ldots, m \\cdot p$ such that $m \\cdot p \\leq p^k$.\nThis inequality simplifies to $m \\leq p^{k-1}$. So, the multiples of $p$ are $1 \\cdot p, 2 \\cdot p, \\ldots, p^{k-1} \\cdot p$.\nThere are exactly $p^{k-1}$ such multiples.\nUsing complementary counting, the number of integers coprime to $p^k$ is the total number of integers minus the count of those not coprime to $p^k$.\n$$\n\\varphi(p^k) = (\\text{total integers}) - (\\text{multiples of } p) = p^k - p^{k-1}\n$$\nThis formula is derived solely from the definition and elementary counting.\n\nNow we can proceed to compute $\\varphi(360)$.\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $360$.\n$360 = 36 \\times 10 = (6^2) \\times (2 \\times 5) = (2 \\times 3)^2 \\times 2 \\times 5 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1$.\nThe integer $360$ is expressed as a product of prime powers: $2^3$, $3^2$, and $5^1$. These factors are pairwise coprime.\n\nUsing the multiplicative property of $\\varphi(n)$ that we justified:\n$$\n\\varphi(360) = \\varphi(2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1) = \\varphi(2^3) \\varphi(3^2) \\varphi(5^1)\n$$\nNow we apply the formula for $\\varphi(p^k)$ to each term:\nFor $\\varphi(2^3)$, we have $p=2$ and $k=3$:\n$$\n\\varphi(2^3) = 2^3 - 2^{3-1} = 2^3 - 2^2 = 8 - 4 = 4\n$$\nFor $\\varphi(3^2)$, we have $p=3$ and $k=2$:\n$$\n\\varphi(3^2) = 3^2 - 3^{2-1} = 3^2 - 3^1 = 9 - 3 = 6\n$$\nFor $\\varphi(5^1)$, we have $p=5$ and $k=1$:\n$$\n\\varphi(5^1) = 5^1 - 5^{1-1} = 5^1 - 5^0 = 5 - 1 = 4\n$$\nFinally, we multiply these results together to find $\\varphi(360)$:\n$$\n\\varphi(360) = 4 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\times 4 = 96\n$$\nThe value of $\\varphi(360)$ is $96$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{96}$$", "id": "3084966"}, {"introduction": "A true test of understanding a mathematical formula is the ability to work backward.
