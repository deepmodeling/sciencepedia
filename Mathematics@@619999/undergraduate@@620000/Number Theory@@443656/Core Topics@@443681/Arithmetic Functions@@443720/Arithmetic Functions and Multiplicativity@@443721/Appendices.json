Its domain is $\\mathbb{N}$ and its codomain is $\\{1\\}$, which is a subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, $1(n)$ is an arithmetic function.\n    - **Multiplicativity:**\n        - The condition $1(1)=1$ must be satisfied. By definition, $1(n)=1$ for all $n$, so $1(1)=1$. This condition holds.\n        - The condition $1(mn)=1(m)1(n)$ must hold for all $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let's test this, which is the condition for complete multiplicativity. For any $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the left side is $1(mn)=1$. The right side is $1(m)1(n)=1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. Since $1(mn)=1(m)1(n)$ holds for all $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the function $1(n)$ is **completely multiplicative**.\n    - **Conclusion:** The function $1(n)$ is a completely multiplicative arithmetic function.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the function $\\varepsilon(n)$:**\n    - **Arithmetic Function:** The function $\\varepsilon(n)$ is defined as $\\varepsilon(1)=1$ and $\\varepsilon(n)=0$ for $n>1$. Its domain is $\\mathbb{N}$ and its codomain is $\\{0, 1\\}$, a subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, $\\varepsilon(n)$ is an arithmetic function. This function is often called the identity element for the Dirichlet convolution.\n    - **Multiplicativity:**\n        - The condition $\\varepsilon(1)=1$ is satisfied by definition.\n        - Let's check for complete multiplicativity: $\\varepsilon(mn)=\\varepsilon(m)\\varepsilon(n)$ for all $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n          - Case 1: If $m=1$, then $\\varepsilon(1 \\cdot n) = \\varepsilon(n)$. The right side is $\\varepsilon(1)\\varepsilon(n)=1 \\cdot \\varepsilon(n)=\\varepsilon(n)$. The equality holds. The same is true if $n=1$.\n          - Case 2: If $m>1$ and $n>1$, then $mn>1$. The left side is $\\varepsilon(mn)=0$. For the right side, since $m>1$ and $n>1$, we have $\\varepsilon(m)=0$ and $\\varepsilon(n)=0$. Thus, $\\varepsilon(m)\\varepsilon(n)=0 \\cdot 0 = 0$. The equality holds.\n        - Since $\\varepsilon(mn)=\\varepsilon(m)\\varepsilon(n)$ for all $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the function $\\varepsilon(n)$ is **completely multiplicative**.\n    - **Conclusion:** The function $\\varepsilon(n)$ is a completely multiplicative arithmetic function.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the function $f_k(n)=n^k$ for a fixed integer $k$:**\n    - **Arithmetic Function:** The function $f_k(n)=n^k$ maps from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$ (for any integer $k$, $n^k$ will be a rational number, which is a complex number). Thus, $f_k(n)$ is an arithmetic function.\n    - **Multiplicativity:**\n        - The condition $f_k(1)=1$ must be satisfied. $f_k(1)=1^k=1$ for any integer $k$. This condition holds.\n        - Let's check for complete multiplicativity: $f_k(mn)=f_k(m)f_k(n)$ for all $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Using the properties of exponents, $f_k(mn)=(mn)^k=m^k n^k$. The right side is $f_k(m)f_k(n)=m^k \\cdot n^k$. The equality holds for all $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n    - **Conclusion:** The function $f_k(n)=n^k$ is a completely multiplicative arithmetic function for any fixed integer $k$.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the function $g(n)=\\log n$:**\n    - **Arithmetic Function:** The function $g(n)=\\log n$ (natural logarithm) maps from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is a subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, $g(n)$ is an arithmetic function.\n    - **Multiplicativity:**\n        - The condition $g(1)=1$ must be satisfied for a function to be multiplicative. Let's calculate $g(1)$. We have $g(1)=\\log 1=0$.\n        - Since $g(1)=0 \\neq 1$, the function $g(n)=\\log n$ is **not multiplicative**.\n    - **Conclusion:** The function $g(n)=\\log n$ is an arithmetic function, but it is not multiplicative (and therefore not completely multiplicative).

We will proceed step-by-step, starting from the given definitions.\n\nLet $\\mu(n)$ be the Möbius function. The function $\\mu^2(n)$ is defined as $(\\mu(n))^2$.\n\nFirst, we prove that $\\mu^2(n)$ is the characteristic function of the squarefree integers. A squarefree integer is a positive integer not divisible by any perfect square other than $1$.\n\nCase $1$: $n$ is not squarefree.\nIf $n$ is not squarefree, then by definition, there exists a prime $p$ such that $p^2 \\mid n$. According to the definition of the Möbius function, if such a prime exists, $\\mu(n) = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\mu^2(n) = (\\mu(n))^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nCase $2$: $n$ is squarefree.\nIf $n$ is squarefree, then its prime factorization is $n = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ for $k \\ge 0$ distinct primes.\nIf $k=0$, then $n=1$. By definition, $\\mu(1) = 1$. Thus, $\\mu^2(1) = 1^2 = 1$. The integer $1$ is squarefree.\nIf $k \\ge 1$, then $n$ is a product of $k$ distinct primes. By definition, $\\mu(n) = (-1)^k$.\nThus, $\\mu^2(n) = ((-1)^k)^2 = 1$.\nIn both sub-cases, if $n$ is squarefree, $\\mu^2(n)=1$.\n\nCombining both cases, we have shown that $\\mu^2(n) = 1$ if $n$ is squarefree and $\\mu^2(n) = 0$ otherwise. This is precisely the definition of the characteristic function for squarefree integers.\n\nSecond, we prove that $\\mu^2(n)$ is a multiplicative function. A function $f$ is multiplicative if $f(1) = 1$ and $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$ for all coprime integers $m, n$ (i.e., $\\gcd(m,n)=1$).\nLet $f(n) = \\mu^2(n)$.\nThe first condition is $f(1)=1$. As shown above, $\\mu^2(1)=1$, so this is satisfied.\n\nFor the second condition, let $m, n$ be two positive integers with $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. We must show that $\\mu^2(mn) = \\mu^2(m)\\mu^2(n)$. We use the property just proved.\n\nCase A: At least one of $m$ or $n$ is not squarefree.\nSuppose $m$ is not squarefree. Then $\\mu^2(m) = 0$. The right side of the equation is $\\mu^2(m)\\mu^2(n) = 0 \\cdot \\mu^2(n) = 0$.\nSince $m$ is not squarefree, there exists a prime $p$ such that $p^2 \\mid m$. Because $p^2 \\mid m$, it follows that $p^2 \\mid mn$. Thus, $mn$ is not squarefree.\nThis implies $\\mu^2(mn)=0$.\nThe equation becomes $0=0$, which is true. The same argument holds if $n$ is not squarefree.\n\nCase B: Both $m$ and $n$ are squarefree.\nIf $m$ and $n$ are both squarefree, then $\\mu^2(m) = 1$ and $\\mu^2(n) = 1$. The right side of the equation is $\\mu^2(m)\\mu^2(n) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nNow we examine the left side, $\\mu^2(mn)$.\nSince $m$ and $n$ are squarefree, their prime factorizations consist of distinct primes. Let $m = p_1 \\cdots p_r$ and $n = q_1 \\cdots q_s$, where $\\{p_i\\}$ and $\\{q_j\\}$ are sets of distinct primes.\nBecause $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, the set of prime factors of $m$ is disjoint from the set of prime factors of $n$. That is, $p_i \\ne q_j$ for all $i,j$.\nThe prime factorization of $mn$ is therefore $p_1 \\cdots p_r q_1 \\cdots q_s$. This is a product of $r+s$ distinct primes.\nConsequently, $mn$ is squarefree, which means $\\mu^2(mn) = 1$.\nThe equation becomes $1=1$, which is true.\n\nIn all cases, for $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, we have $\\mu^2(mn) = \\mu^2(m)\\mu^2(n)$. Thus, $\\mu^2(n)$ is a multiplicative function.\n\nThird, we evaluate the divisor sum $F(n) = \\sum_{d|n}\\mu^2(d)$.\nThere is a fundamental theorem in number theory which states that if $f(n)$ is a multiplicative function, then its summatory function $F(n) = \\sum_{d|n}f(d)$ is also multiplicative.\nSince we have proved that $\\mu^2(n)$ is multiplicative, the function $F(n) = \\sum_{d|n}\\mu^2(d)$ is also multiplicative.\n\nTo find an explicit formula for a multiplicative function $F(n)$, it is sufficient to evaluate it on prime powers, i.e., for $n=p^a$ where $p$ is a prime and $a \\ge 1$ is an integer. Then, for a general integer $n$ with prime factorization $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, the value of $F(n)$ is given by $F(n) = F(p_1^{a_1}) F(p_2^{a_2}) \\cdots F(p_k^{a_k})$ due to its multiplicativity.\n\nLet's evaluate $F(p^a)$ for $a \\ge 1$:\nThe divisors $d$ of $p^a$ are $1, p, p^2, \\ldots, p^a$.\nSo, $F(p^a) = \\sum_{j=0}^{a} \\mu^2(p^j) = \\mu^2(p^0) + \\mu^2(p^1) + \\mu^2(p^2) + \\dots + \\mu^2(p^a)$.\nWe use our earlier finding on $\\mu^2(n)$:\n$\\mu^2(p^0) = \\mu^2(1) = 1$ (since $1$ is squarefree).\n$\\mu^2(p^1) = \\mu^2(p) = 1$ (since a prime $p$ is squarefree).\nFor any $j \\ge 2$, the integer $p^j$ is divisible by $p^2$, so it is not squarefree. Thus, $\\mu^2(p^j) = 0$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the sum for $F(p^a)$:\n$F(p^a) = 1 + 1 + 0 + \\dots + 0 = 2$.\nThis result holds for any prime $p$ and any exponent $a \\ge 1$.\n\nNow we can find the general formula for $F(n)$. Let the prime factorization of $n$ be $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, \\ldots, p_k$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$ and $a_i \\ge 1$. The number of distinct prime factors of $n$ is denoted by $\\omega(n)$, which is $k$ in this factorization.\nUsing the multiplicativity of $F(n)$:\n$F(n) = F(p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}) = F(p_1^{a_1}) F(p_2^{a_2}) \\cdots F(p_k^{a_k})$.\nSince $F(p_i^{a_i}) = 2$ for each $i=1, \\ldots, k$:\n$F(n) = \\underbrace{2 \\cdot 2 \\cdots 2}_{k \\text{ times}} = 2^k$.\n\nSince $k = \\omega(n)$, the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$, we have:\n$\\sum_{d|n}\\mu^2(d) = 2^{\\omega(n)}$.\n\nThis formula also holds for the edge case $n=1$. The set of prime divisors of $1$ is empty, so $\\omega(1)=0$. The formula gives $2^{\\omega(1)} = 2^0 = 1$. The direct calculation is $\\sum_{d|1}\\mu^2(d) = \\mu^2(1) = 1$.

We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the Dirichlet inverse $f^{-1}$ of the arithmetic function $f(n)=n^r$ for a fixed real number $r$. The Dirichlet inverse $f^{-1}$ is defined by the relation $(f*f^{-1})(n) = \\varepsilon(n)$, where $*$ denotes the Dirichlet convolution and $\\varepsilon$ is the multiplicative identity for convolution, defined by $\\varepsilon(1)=1$ and $\\varepsilon(n)=0$ for $n>1$.\n\nThe function $f(n)=n^r$ is completely multiplicative, meaning $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. A fundamental property of Dirichlet convolution is that the inverse of a multiplicative function is also multiplicative. Since $f$ is completely multiplicative, it is also multiplicative, and thus its inverse $f^{-1}$ must be multiplicative.\n\nA multiplicative function is uniquely determined by its values on prime powers.

So, we have determined $f^{-1}(p^k)$ explicitly:\n$$ f^{-1}(p^k) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } k=0 \\\\ -p^r & \\text{if } k=1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } k \\geq 2 \\end{cases} $$\nNow we deduce the closed-form expression for $f^{-1}(n)$. As $f^{-1}$ is multiplicative, if $n$ has the prime factorization $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_m^{k_m}$, then:\n$$ f^{-1}(n) = f^{-1}(p_1^{k_1}) f^{-1}(p_2^{k_2}) \\cdots f^{-1}(p_m^{k_m}) $$\nWe consider two cases for $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is not square-free.\nThis means that for at least one prime factor $p_i$, the exponent $k_i$ is greater than or equal to $2$. In this case, the factor $f^{-1}(p_i^{k_i})$ in the product will be $0$, which makes the entire product zero. So, $f^{-1}(n)=0$ if $n$ is not square-free.\nBy definition, the Möbius function $\\mu(n)$ is also $0$ if $n$ is not square-free. Thus, for such $n$, $f^{-1}(n) = 0 = \\mu(n)n^r$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is square-free.\nThis means that all exponents $k_i$ in the prime factorization are equal to $1$. So, $n=p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m$ for distinct primes $p_i$ (if $n=1$, $m=0$).\nIf $n=1$, we have $f^{-1}(1)=1$, and $\\mu(1)1^r=1$. The formula holds.\nIf $n = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m$ with $m \\geq 1$:\n$$ f^{-1}(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^m f^{-1}(p_i) $$\nUsing our result $f^{-1}(p)=-p^r$, we have:\n$$ f^{-1}(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^m (-p_i^r) = (-1)^m \\prod_{i=1}^m p_i^r = (-1)^m \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^m p_i \\right)^r = (-1)^m n^r $$\nFor a square-free integer $n = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m$, the Möbius function is defined as $\\mu(n)=(-1)^m$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $f^{-1}(n)$:\n$$ f^{-1}(n) = \\mu(n)n^r $$\nThis formula holds for all square-free $n$.\n\nSince the expression $f^{-1}(n) = \\mu(n)n^r$ holds for both square-free and non-square-free integers, it is the general closed-form expression for $f^{-1}(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\mu(n)n^{r}}\n$$", "id": "3081490"}]}
