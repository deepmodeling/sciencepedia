Our objective is to find an explicit expression for $f(n)$.\n\nTo do this, we use the Möbius inversion formula, which provides a way to express $f$ in terms of $F$. This formula relies on the Möbius function, $\\mu(n)$, which is the Dirichlet inverse of the unit function $u$. The defining property of the inverse is that $(u * \\mu)(n) = (\\mu * u)(n) = \\epsilon(n)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the identity element for Dirichlet convolution, defined as $\\epsilon(1)=1$ and $\\epsilon(n)=0$ for $n>1$.

Thus, we have established that $f(n) = \\phi(n)$.\n\nNext, we are asked to provide a combinatorial interpretation. Let us consider the finite cyclic group of order $n$, denoted $C_n$. The total number of elements in this group is $|C_n|=n$. Let us set $F(n) = |C_n| = n$, which is consistent with the problem statement. The order of any element in $C_n$ must be a divisor $d$ of $n$. We can partition the group $C_n$ into disjoint subsets, where each subset consists of all elements of a particular order $d$. If we let $f(d)$ denote the number of elements of order $d$ in the group $C_n$, then the total number of elements in the group is the sum of the sizes of these subsets:\n$$\n|C_n| = \\sum_{d \\mid n} (\\text{number of elements of order } d)\n$$\nSubstituting our functional notation, this becomes $F(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} f(d)$, which perfectly matches the given relation. In this model, the function $f(n)$ represents the number of elements of order $n$ in the group $C_n$. These are precisely the generators of the group. It is a fundamental theorem of group theory that the number of generators of a cyclic group of order $n$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$.
