We will proceed by addressing each part of the problem sequentially.\n\n(a) To establish the divisor-sum relation, we consider the set $S$ of all ordered pairs of integers $(a,b)$ where $1 \\leq a,b \\leq n$. The total number of such pairs is $n \\times n = n^{2}$. We can partition this set $S$ into disjoint subsets based on the value of $d = \\gcd(a, b, n)$. Since $d$ must divide $a$, $b$, and $n$, it follows that $d$ must be a divisor of $n$. Therefore, we can write the following disjoint union:\n$$S = \\bigcup_{d|n} \\{(a,b) : 1 \\leq a,b \\leq n, \\gcd(a,b,n) = d\\}$$\nBy summing the sizes of these disjoint subsets, we obtain the size of $S$:\n$$n^{2} = \\sum_{d|n} |\\{(a,b) : 1 \\leq a,b \\leq n, \\gcd(a,b,n) = d\\}|$$\nLet's analyze the condition $\\gcd(a,b,n) = d$. For this to hold, $d$ must divide $a$ and $b$. We can write $a = da'$ and $b = db'$ for some integers $a'$ and $b'$. The constraints $1 \\leq a \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq b \\leq n$ imply $1 \\leq da' \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq db' \\leq n$, which simplifies to $1 \\leq a' \\leq n/d$ and $1 \\leq b' \\leq n/d$.\nThe gcd condition becomes $\\gcd(da', db', n) = d$. Let $n = dk$ for some integer $k$. Then the condition is $\\gcd(da', db', dk) = d$. Using the property $\\gcd(cx, cy, cz) = c \\cdot \\gcd(x, y, z)$, we have $d \\cdot \\gcd(a', b', n/d) = d$. This implies $\\gcd(a', b', n/d) = 1$.\nThe number of such pairs $(a',b')$ for a fixed $d$ is, by definition, $J_{2}(n/d)$. Thus, the size of the subset for a given $d$ is $J_{2}(n/d)$. Substituting this into our sum:\n$$n^{2} = \\sum_{d|n} J_{2}(n/d)$$\nAs $d$ runs through all divisors of $n$, the value $k = n/d$ also runs through all divisors of $n$. We can therefore re-index the sum by letting $d$ be the argument of $J_{2}$:\n$$n^{2} = \\sum_{d|n} J_{2}(d)$$\nThis is the required divisor-sum relation, expressing $n^{2}$ as a sum over the divisors of $n$.\n\n(b) The Möbius inversion formula states that if $F(n) = \\sum_{d|n} f(d)$, then $f(n) = \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) F(n/d)$, where $\\mu$ is the Möbius function.\nFrom part (a), we have the relation $n^{2} = \\sum_{d|n} J_{2}(d)$.\nWe can identify $F(n) = n^{2}$ and $f(n) = J_{2}(n)$. Applying the Möbius inversion formula directly yields the expression for $J_{2}(n)$:\n$$J_{2}(n) = \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) F(n/d)$$\n$$J_{2}(n) = \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) \\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)^{2}$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $J_{2}(n)$ in terms of the Möbius function $\\mu$ and the arithmetic function $f(n)=n^2$.\n\n(c) We are asked to evaluate $J_{2}(84)$ using the expression derived in part (b). The prime factorization of $84$ is $84 = 2^{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$.\nThe formula is $J_{2}(84) = \\sum_{d|84} \\mu(d) (84/d)^{2}$.\nThe Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ is non-zero only for square-free divisors $d$.

This means if $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, then $J_{k}(mn) = J_{k}(m)J_{k}(n)$.\nSince $84 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$, and the factors $4$, $3$, and $7$ are pairwise coprime, we have $J_{2}(84) = J_{2}(4) \\cdot J_{2}(3) \\cdot J_{2}(7)$.\nWe need the formula for $J_{2}(n)$ on prime powers, $n=p^{k}$. An equivalent form of the formula for $J_{2}(n)$ is $J_{2}(n) = n^{2}\\prod_{p|n}(1-p^{-2})$, where the product is over the distinct prime divisors of $n$.\nFor a prime power $n=p^{k}$, the only prime divisor is $p$.\nSo, $J_{2}(p^{k}) = (p^{k})^{2} (1 - p^{-2}) = p^{2k} (1 - \\frac{1}{p^{2}}) = p^{2k} \\frac{p^{2}-1}{p^{2}} = p^{2k-2}(p^{2}-1)$.\nWe now evaluate the components:\nFor $p^{k} = 4 = 2^{2}$ ($p=2, k=2$):\n$J_{2}(4) = J_{2}(2^{2}) = 2^{2(2)-2}(2^{2}-1) = 2^{2}(3) = 4 \\cdot 3 = 12$.\nFor $p^{k} = 3 = 3^{1}$ ($p=3, k=1$):\n$J_{2}(3) = J_{2}(3^{1}) = 3^{2(1)-2}(3^{2}-1) = 3^{0}(8) = 1 \\cdot 8 = 8$.\nFor $p^{k} = 7 = 7^{1}$ ($p=7, k=1$):\n$J_{2}(7) = J_{2}(7^{1}) = 7^{2(1)-2}(7^{2}-1) = 7^{0}(48) = 1 \\cdot 48 = 48$.\nFinally, we compute the product:\n$J_{2}(84) = J_{2}(4) \\cdot J_{2}(3) \\cdot J_{2}(7) = 12 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 48 = 96 \\cdot 48$.\n$96 \\cdot 48 = 96 \\cdot (50-2) = 4800 - 192 = 4608$.\nThis value matches the result of $4608$ obtained in part (c), thus verifying the calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4608}$$", "id": "3081469"}, {"introduction": "The principle of inversion is more general than the standard Dirichlet convolution alone; it applies to any suitable convolution operation on arithmetic functions.

This must be accomplished in $O(N \\log N)$ time.\n\nFirst, we formalize the given relationship using the language of number theory. The sum $\\sum_{d \\mid n} g(d) h\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)$ defines the Dirichlet convolution of two arithmetic functions $g$ and $h$, denoted as $(g * h)(n)$. The given relation $F(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)$ can be expressed as a Dirichlet convolution by defining the constant-one function, $u(n) = 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$. The relation is then equivalent to $F(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} u(d) f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) = (u * f)(n)$. Due to the commutativity of Dirichlet convolution, this is also equal to $(f * u)(n)$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to invert this convolution to find $f$ given $F$. This is achieved using the Möbius inversion formula. The Möbius function, $\\mu(n)$, is an arithmetic function defined as:\n- $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n- $\\mu(n) = (-1)^k$ if $n$ is the product of $k$ distinct prime numbers (i.e., $n$ is square-free).\n- $\\mu(n) = 0$ if $n$ has a squared prime factor.\n\nThe Möbius function is the Dirichlet inverse of the constant-one function $u(n)$. Their convolution yields the identity element for Dirichlet convolution, $\\epsilon(n)$, which is defined as $\\epsilon(1) = 1$ and $\\epsilon(n) = 0$ for $n > 1$. That is, $(u * \\mu)(n) = \\epsilon(n)$.\n\nTo recover $f$, we convolve both sides of the equation $F = f * u$ with $\\mu$:\n$$F * \\mu = (f * u) * \\mu$$\nSince Dirichlet convolution is associative, we can regroup the terms:\n$$F * \\mu = f * (u * \\mu)$$\nSubstituting the identity $(u * \\mu) = \\epsilon$:\n$$F * \\mu = f * \\epsilon$$\nThe convolution of any function $f$ with the identity element $\\epsilon$ returns $f$ itself: $(f * \\epsilon)(n) = \\sum_{d|n} f(d)\\epsilon(n/d) = f(n)\\epsilon(1) = f(n)$.\nTherefore, we arrive at the inversion formula:\n$$f = F * \\mu$$\nExplicitly, this means the value of $f(n)$ can be calculated as:\n$$f(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} F(d) \\mu\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)$$\n\nTo implement an algorithm that computes $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(N)$ in $O(N \\log N)$ time, we need two components: an efficient way to compute the Möbius function values and an efficient way to compute the Dirichlet convolution.\n\n1.  **Computing the Möbius function $\\mu(n)$**: The values of $\\mu(n)$ for $n$ from $1$ to $N$ can be pre-computed using a sieve-based method. A linear sieve, for example, can compute all required $\\mu$ values in $O(N)$ time. This is well within the overall time complexity budget. The algorithm initializes an array for $\\mu$ and an array for the least prime factor ($lp$) of each number. It iterates from $i=2$ to $N$, identifying primes and using the properties of $\\mu$ to fill the array: $\\mu(p) = -1$ for a prime $p$, $\\mu(i \\cdot p) = -\\mu(i)$ if $p$ does not divide $i$, and $\\mu(i \\cdot p) = 0$ if $p$ divides $i$.\n\n2.  **Computing the Dirichlet Convolution**: To compute the values of a convolution $C = A * B$ for all integers up to $N$, a naive approach of computing each $C(n) = \\sum_{d|n} A(d)B(n/d)$ separately would be inefficient. A more efficient, $O(N \\log N)$ algorithm is derived by reorganizing the computation. Instead of iterating through divisors for each $n$, we iterate through all pairs $(i, j)$ such that their product $i \\cdot j \\le N$ and add the term $A(i) \\cdot B(j)$ to the sum for $C(i \\cdot j)$. This can be implemented with a nested loop:\n    ```\n    for i from 1 to N:\n        for j from 1 to floor(N/i):\n            C[i*j] += A[i] * B[j]\n    ```\n    The total number of operations is the sum of the inner loop counts, which is $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\lfloor \\frac{N}{i} \\rfloor$. This sum is bounded by $N \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{i}$, which is approximately $N H_N \\approx N \\log N$. This method is used for both constructing the input array $F$ from a given $f$ (as $F = f * u$) and for recovering $f$ from $F$ (as $f = F * \\mu$).\n\nThe overall algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n- We first pre-compute $\\mu(n)$ for $n \\in [1, \\text{max}(N)]$ across all test cases.\n- For each test case with a given underlying function $f$, we first compute the array $F(1), \\dots, F(N)$ by performing the Dirichlet convolution $F = f * u$.\n- Then, we apply the recovery algorithm by computing the Dirichlet convolution $f_{\\text{recovered}} = F * \\mu$.\n- Finally, we compute the required aggregate result from the recovered $f_{\\text{recovered}}$ values. For the case where $F$ is given directly, we skip the first step.\nThe use of fixed-size integer arrays (e.g., $64$-bit integers) is appropriate for the calculations involved in the specified test cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for the given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def sieve_mu(n_max):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes Möbius function mu(i) for i from 1 to n_max using a linear sieve.\n        Time complexity: O(n_max)\n        \"\"\"\n        mu = np.zeros(n_max + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n        lp = np.zeros(n_max + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n        primes = []\n        mu[1] = 1\n        for i in range(2, n_max + 1):\n            if lp[i] == 0:\n                lp[i] = i\n                primes.append(i)\n                mu[i] = -1\n            for p in primes:\n                if p > lp[i] or i * p > n_max:\n                    break\n                lp[i * p] = p\n                if p == lp[i]:\n                    mu[i * p] = 0\n                    break\n                else:\n                    mu[i * p] = -mu[i]\n        return mu\n\n    def dirichlet_convolution(A, B, n_max):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the Dirichlet convolution C = A * B for n from 1 to n_max.\n        A and B are 1-indexed numpy arrays of size n_max + 1.\n        Time complexity: O(n_max * log(n_max))\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure A and B are of compatible length\n        len_A = len(A) - 1\n        len_B = len(B) - 1\n        C = np.zeros(n_max + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n        \n        for i in range(1, n_max + 1):\n            if i > len_A or A[i] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Iterate j up to n_max / i\n            limit_j = n_max // i\n            if limit_j > len_B:\n                limit_j = len_B\n\n            for j in range(1, limit_j + 1):\n                if B[j] == 0:\n                    continue\n                C[i * j] += A[i] * B[j]\n        return C\n\n    max_n_in_tests = 30\n    mu_sieved = sieve_mu(max_n_in_tests)\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Test Case 1\n    N1 = 20\n    f1_true = np.ones(N1 + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n    f1_true[0] = 0\n    u1 = np.ones(N1 + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n    u1[0] = 0\n    F1 = dirichlet_convolution(f1_true, u1, N1)\n    f1_recovered = dirichlet_convolution(F1, mu_sieved, N1)\n    results.append(np.sum(f1_recovered[1:]))\n\n    # Test Case 2\n    N2 = 30\n    f2_true = np.arange(N2 + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n    u2 = np.ones(N2 + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n    u2[0] = 0\n    F2 = dirichlet_convolution(f2_true, u2, N2)\n    f2_recovered = dirichlet_convolution(F2, mu_sieved, N2)\n    results.append(f2_recovered[N2])\n\n    # Test Case 3\n    N3 = 1\n    F3 = np.array([0, 7], dtype=np.int64)\n    f3_recovered = dirichlet_convolution(F3, mu_sieved, N3)\n    results.append(f3_recovered[1])\n\n    # Test Case 4\n    N4 = 25\n    f4_true = np.array([0] + [(-1)**n for n in range(1, N4 + 1)], dtype=np.int64)\n    u4 = np.ones(N4 + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n    u4[0] = 0\n    F4 = dirichlet_convolution(f4_true, u4, N4)\n    f4_recovered = dirichlet_convolution(F4, mu_sieved, N4)\n    count_positive_one = np.sum(f4_recovered[1:] == 1)\n    results.append(count_positive_one)\n    \n    # Final output formatting\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "3081477"}]}
