I will proceed with a detailed solution as requested.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the residue $r$ of $a^{n-1}$ modulo $n$, where $n=341$ and $a=2$. This computation is central to the Fermat primality test.\n\nThe Fermat primality test is based on Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), which states that if $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, the congruence $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ holds. The test checks if a given integer $n$ behaves like a prime with respect to a chosen base $a$. Specifically, if an integer $n > 1$ satisfies $a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ for some integer $a$ with $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$, we say that $n$ passes the Fermat primality test for base $a$. If $n$ is composite yet satisfies this condition, it is called a Fermat pseudoprime to base $a$.\n\nWe are asked to compute $r \\equiv 2^{340} \\pmod{341}$. A direct computation would be excessively laborious. The problem specifies the use of foundational results, namely Fermat's Little Theorem and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). This suggests we should first find the prime factorization of the modulus, $n=341$.\n\nUpon inspection, we find that $341$ is divisible by $11$: $341 = 11 \\times 31$. Both $11$ and $31$ are prime numbers. This factorization allows us to analyze the congruence modulo $11$ and modulo $31$ separately, and then combine the results using the CRT.\n\nFirst, let's compute $2^{340} \\pmod{11}$.\nSince $11$ is a prime number and it does not divide $2$, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n$$2^{11-1} \\equiv 2^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\nThe exponent in our original expression is $340$. We can express $340$ in terms of $10$: $340 = 10 \\times 34$.\nUsing this, we can evaluate the congruence:\n$$2^{340} = 2^{10 \\times 34} = (2^{10})^{34} \\pmod{11}$$\nSubstituting the result from FLT:\n$$(2^{10})^{34} \\equiv 1^{34} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\nThus, we have our first congruence: $2^{340} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSecond, let's compute $2^{340} \\pmod{31}$.\nSince $31$ is a prime number and it does not divide $2$, we can again apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n$$2^{31-1} \\equiv 2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$$\nThe exponent is $340$. We express $340$ in terms of $30$: $340 = 30 \\times 11 + 10$.\nUsing this, we evaluate the congruence:\n$$2^{340} = 2^{30 \\times 11 + 10} = (2^{30})^{11} \\cdot 2^{10} \\pmod{31}$$\nSubstituting the result from FLT:\n$$(2^{30})^{11} \\cdot 2^{10} \\equiv 1^{11} \\cdot 2^{10} \\equiv 2^{10} \\pmod{31}$$\nWe must now compute $2^{10} \\pmod{31}$. A simpler route is to notice that $2^5 = 32 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$. This arises because $2$ is a primitive root of $31$ only if its order is $\\phi(31)=30$, but here its order is $5$.\nUsing this fact:\n$$2^{10} = (2^5)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$$\nThus, we have our second congruence: $2^{340} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nNow, we must find the integer $r$ such that $0 \\le r < 341$ which simultaneously satisfies the system of congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} r & \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11} \\\\ r & \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a unique solution modulo the product $11 \\times 31 = 341$, since $\\gcd(11, 31) = 1$. In this particular case, the solution is immediate by inspection. The number $r=1$ clearly satisfies both congruences.\nFormally, the first congruence implies $r-1$ is a multiple of $11$, and the second implies $r-1$ is a multiple of $31$. Since $11$ and $31$ are coprime, $r-1$ must be a multiple of their product, $341$.\nSo, $r-1 = k \\cdot 341$ for some integer $k$. This is equivalent to $r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{341}$.\nTherefore, the residue is $r=1$.\n\nFrom this computation, we conclude that $2^{340} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{341}$. Since $n=341$ is composite ($341 = 11 \\times 31$), it satisfies the base-$2$ Fermat condition for primality, $2^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, despite not being prime. It is therefore classified as a Fermat pseudoprime to base $2$. In fact, $341$ is the smallest such number.\n\nFor the requested commentary, the Solovay-Strassen primality test refines the Fermat test by checking whether $a^{(n-1)/2} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right) \\pmod{n}$, where $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)$ is the Jacobi symbol. For our case, $a=2$ and $n=341$.\nWe first compute $2^{(n-1)/2} \\pmod n = 2^{(341-1)/2} \\pmod{341} = 2^{170} \\pmod{341}$.\nUsing the same CRT approach:\nModulo $11$: $170 = 10 \\times 17$, so $2^{170} = (2^{10})^{17} \\equiv 1^{17} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nModulo $31$: $170 = 5 \\times 34$, and since $2^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$, we have $2^{170} = (2^5)^{34} \\equiv 1^{34} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\nBy CRT, since $2^{170}$ is congruent to $1$ modulo both $11$ and $31$, we have $2^{170} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{341}$.\n\nNext, we compute the Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{2}{341}\\right)$. The rule for the Jacobi symbol with numerator $2$ is $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) = (-1)^{(n^2-1)/8}$. A simpler formulation states that $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) = 1$ if $n \\equiv 1, 7 \\pmod{8}$ and $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) = -1$ if $n \\equiv 3, 5 \\pmod{8}$.\nWe evaluate $341$ modulo $8$: $341 = 8 \\times 42 + 5$, so $341 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$.\nTherefore, $\\left(\\frac{2}{341}\\right) = -1$.\n\nThe Solovay-Strassen condition is $2^{170} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{2}{341}\\right) \\pmod{341}$, which becomes $1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{341}$. This is false, as $1 - (-1) = 2$, and $341$ does not divide $2$. Because the condition fails, the Solovay-Strassen test correctly identifies $341$ as a composite number.\n\nThe problem, however, asks only for the numerical residue $r$ of $2^{340}$ modulo $341$. Based on the primary calculation, this value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3091005"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that the Fermat test can be deceived, we now turn to a more refined method: the Solovay-Strassen primality test.

We can test small prime divisors. $341$ is not divisible by $2$, $3$, or $5$. For $7$, $341 = 48 \\times 7 + 5$. For $11$, $341 = 11 \\times 31$. Since $11$ and $31$ are both prime numbers, the factorization is $n = 11 \\times 31$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of $x = 2^{170} \\bmod 341$**\n\nTo compute $2^{170} \\bmod 341$, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). We will compute the value modulo $11$ and modulo $31$ separately.\n\nModulo $11$:\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), since $11$ is a prime number and $11$ does not divide $2$, we have $2^{11-1} \\equiv 2^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nWe can write the exponent $170$ in terms of $10$: $170 = 17 \\times 10$.\nTherefore, $2^{170} = 2^{17 \\times 10} = (2^{10})^{17}$.\nTaking this modulo $11$, we get:\n$2^{170} \\equiv (1)^{17} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nModulo $31$:\nSimilarly, by FLT, since $31$ is a prime number and $31$ does not divide $2$, we have $2^{31-1} \\equiv 2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\nWe can also work with a smaller power of $2$. We note that $2^5 = 32 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\nThe exponent is $170$. We can write $170$ in terms of $5$: $170 = 5 \\times 34$.\nSo, $2^{170} = (2^5)^{34}$.\nTaking this modulo $31$:\n$2^{170} \\equiv (1)^{34} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nCombining the results with the CRT:\nWe have the following system of congruences for $x = 2^{170}$:\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$$\nSince $x$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by both $11$ and $31$, and since $\\gcd(11, 31)=1$, $x$ must leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by their product $11 \\times 31 = 341$.\nThus, $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{341}$.\nThe value of $2^{170} \\bmod 341$ is $1$.
