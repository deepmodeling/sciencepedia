We are to determine if $n$ is a base-$3$ pseudoprime and compute the value of $r \\equiv 3^{n-1} \\pmod{n}$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the preconditions for the definition of a base-$a$ pseudoprime are met. The integer $n=77$ is composite, as $n=7 \\times 11$. The base is $a=3$. We check the condition $\\gcd(a,n)=1$: $\\gcd(3, 77) = \\gcd(3, 7 \\times 11) = 1$, since $3$ is not a factor of $7$ or $11$. The condition is satisfied.\n\nAccording to the definition provided, $n=77$ is a base-$3$ pseudoprime if $3^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. In our case, this is $3^{77-1} \\equiv 3^{76} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{77}$.\nBy the properties of modular arithmetic, this single congruence is equivalent to the system of congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n3^{76} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n3^{76} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe problem directs us to identify a prime factor $p$ of $n$ for which the multiplicative order of $3$ modulo $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{ord}_{p}(3)$, does not divide $n-1 = 76$. Let's examine the prime factor $p=7$.\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, since $7$ is a prime and $\\gcd(3,7)=1$, we have $3^{7-1} \\equiv 3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. The multiplicative order $\\operatorname{ord}_{7}(3)$ is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that $3^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Based on this, $\\operatorname{ord}_{7}(3)$ must be a divisor of $6$. The divisors of $6$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$. We test them:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\n    \\item $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n    \\item $3^3 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $d=1, 2, 3$ do not yield $1$, the order must be $\\operatorname{ord}_{7}(3) = 6$.\n\nNow we check if $\\operatorname{ord}_{7}(3)$ divides $n-1 = 76$. We perform the division: $76 = 12 \\times 6 + 4$. Since the remainder is non-zero, $6$ does not divide $76$. Thus, $p=7$ is a prime factor of $n$ for which $\\operatorname{ord}_{p}(3) \\nmid (n-1)$.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce from first principles that $n=77$ is not a base-$3$ pseudoprime. A fundamental property of multiplicative order is that $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ if and only if $\\operatorname{ord}_{p}(a) \\mid k$. For our case, $3^{76} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ would be true if and only if $\\operatorname{ord}_{7}(3) \\mid 76$. As we have just shown that $6 \\nmid 76$, it must be that $3^{76} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Since one of the congruences in the system is false, the original congruence $3^{76} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{77}$ cannot hold. Therefore, $n=77$ is not a base-$3$ pseudoprime.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact residue $r \\equiv 3^{76} \\pmod{77}$, where $0 \\le r  77$. We must solve the system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nr \\equiv 3^{76} \\pmod{7} \\\\\nr \\equiv 3^{76} \\pmod{11}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFor the first congruence, modulo $7$:\nSince $76 = 12 \\times 6 + 4$ and $\\operatorname{ord}_{7}(3)=6$, we have:\n$$3^{76} = 3^{12 \\cdot 6 + 4} = (3^6)^{12} \\cdot 3^4 \\equiv 1^{12} \\cdot 3^4 \\equiv 3^4 \\pmod{7}$$\nWe compute $3^4$: $3^4 = 81 = 11 \\times 7 + 4$. So, $3^4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\nThe first congruence is $r \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nFor the second congruence, modulo $11$:\nFirst, we find $\\operatorname{ord}_{11}(3)$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $3^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The order must divide $10$. The divisors are $1, 2, 5, 10$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\n    \\item $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$\n    \\item $3^5 = 243 = 22 \\times 11 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe smallest positive power is $5$, so $\\operatorname{ord}_{11}(3) = 5$.\nNow we evaluate $3^{76} \\pmod{11}$. We write $76$ in terms of the order $5$: $76 = 15 \\times 5 + 1$.\n$$3^{76} = 3^{15 \\cdot 5 + 1} = (3^5)^{15} \\cdot 3^1 \\equiv 1^{15} \\cdot 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$$\nThe second congruence is $r \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nWe now solve the system:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nr \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\\\\nr \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the first congruence, we can write $r = 7k + 4$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second congruence:\n$$7k + 4 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$7k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$7k \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$$\nTo solve for $k$, we need the multiplicative inverse of $7$ modulo $11$. We can see that $7 \\times 8 = 56 = 5 \\times 11 + 1$, so $7^{-1} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$. Multiplying both sides by $8$:\n$$8 \\cdot (7k) \\equiv 8 \\cdot 10 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$k \\equiv 80 \\pmod{11}$$\nSince $80 = 7 \\times 11 + 3$, we have $k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\nSo, $k$ can be written as $k = 11j + 3$ for some integer $j$. Substituting this back into the expression for $r$:\n$$r = 7(11j + 3) + 4 = 77j + 21 + 4 = 77j + 25$$\nThis means $r \\equiv 25 \\pmod{77}$.

This is denoted as $\\operatorname{ord}_m(a)$. A direct consequence of Fermat's Little Theorem is that if $p$ is a prime number, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. This implies that $\\operatorname{ord}_p(a)$ must be a divisor of $p-1$.\n\nThe $L$-th cyclotomic polynomial, denoted $\\Phi_L(x)$, is the unique monic irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that is a divisor of $x^L-1$ but not a divisor of $x^k-1$ for any $k  L$. The roots of $\\Phi_L(x)$ are the primitive $L$-th roots of unity. The cyclotomic polynomials satisfy the identity $x^N-1 = \\prod_{d\\mid N} \\Phi_d(x)$. For the specific case where $L$ is a prime number, this identity simplifies to $x^L-1 = \\Phi_1(x) \\Phi_L(x) = (x-1)\\Phi_L(x)$, which gives the well-known formula:\n$$\\Phi_L(x) = \\frac{x^L-1}{x-1} = x^{L-1} + x^{L-2} + \\dots + x + 1$$\n\nThe problem specifies $a=2$ and $L=11$. We are first asked to compute the set of prime divisors of $\\Phi_L(a)$.\nSubstituting the given values, we compute $\\Phi_{11}(2)$:\n$$\\Phi_{11}(2) = \\frac{2^{11}-1}{2-1} = 2^{11}-1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047$$\n\nNext, we find the prime factorization of $2047$. We test for small prime divisors.\nThe number is not divisible by $2$, $3$, or $5$.\nWe check divisibility by primes of the form $2kL+1$, i.e., $22k+1$, as any prime factor $p$ of $\\Phi_L(a)$ must satisfy $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2L}$ or $p=L$. Since $2047$ is not divisible by $11$, we check primes of the form $22k+1$. For $k=1$, we test $p=23$.\n$$2047 \\div 23 = 89$$\nWe check if $23$ and $89$ are prime. $23$ is a prime number. To check if $89$ is prime, we test divisibility by primes up to $\\sqrt{89} \\approx 9.4$. These primes are $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$. $89$ is not divisible by any of these, so $89$ is prime.\nThus, the prime factorization of $2047$ is $23 \\times 89$. The set of prime divisors of $\\Phi_{11}(2)$ is $\\{23, 89\\}$.\n\nThe second task is to determine, for each such prime divisor $p$, whether $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod L$. Here, $L=11$.\nFor $p=23$: $23 = 2 \\times 11 + 1$. Thus, $23 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nFor $p=89$: $89 = 8 \\times 11 + 1$. Thus, $89 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nThe condition holds for both prime divisors.\n\nThis property is not a coincidence. Let $p$ be any prime divisor of $\\Phi_{11}(2)$. By definition of a divisor, $\\Phi_{11}(2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. Since $\\Phi_{11}(2) = 2^{11}-1$, this means $2^{11}-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, or $2^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\nFrom the definition of multiplicative order, this implies that $\\operatorname{ord}_p(2)$ must divide $11$. Since $11$ is a prime number, the possible values for $\\operatorname{ord}_p(2)$ are $1$ and $11$.\nIf $\\operatorname{ord}_p(2) = 1$, then $2^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, which implies $p$ divides $1$. This is impossible for a prime $p$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{ord}_p(2)$ must be exactly $11$.\nFrom the properties of multiplicative order derived from Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that $\\operatorname{ord}_p(2)$ must divide $p-1$.\nSo, we must have $11 \\mid (p-1)$, which is equivalent to the condition $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This provides the theoretical justification for the results we verified numerically.\n\nThe third task is to form a composite number $n$ as the product of at least two distinct such primes and justify that it is a base-$a$ Fermat pseudoprime. The set of qualifying primes we found is $\\{23, 89\\}$. To form the smallest such composite number $n$, we must take the product of the two smallest available primes, which are $23$ and $89$.\n$$n = 23 \\times 89 = 2047$$\nA base-$a$ Fermat pseudoprime is a composite integer $n$ satisfying $a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, with $\\gcd(a,n)=1$. Here, $a=2$ and $n=2047$.\n$n=2047$ is composite by construction. Also, $\\gcd(2, 2047)=1$ as $2047$ is odd. We must justify, from first principles, that $2^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$.\nThis is equivalent to showing $2^{2046} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2047}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this congruence holds if and only if it holds modulo each of the prime factors of $n$. That is, we must show:\n1. $2^{2046} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$\n2. $2^{2046} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{89}$\n\nFor the first congruence, we know that a congruence $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ holds if and only if $\\operatorname{ord}_p(a)$ divides $k$. We established that $\\operatorname{ord}_{23}(2) = 11$. So we need to check if $11$ divides the exponent $2046$.\n$$2046 = 11 \\times 186$$\nSince $11 \\mid 2046$, it follows that $2^{2046} = (2^{11})^{186} \\equiv 1^{186} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$. The first congruence is satisfied.\n\nFor the second congruence, we established that $\\operatorname{ord}_{89}(2) = 11$. Since $11$ also divides $2046$, we have $2^{2046} = (2^{11})^{186} \\equiv 1^{186} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{89}$. The second congruence is also satisfied.\n\nBecause $2^{2046}-1$ is divisible by both $23$ and $89$, it must be divisible by their product, $2047$. Therefore, $2^{2046} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2047}$.\nSince $n=2047$ is a composite number satisfying $2^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, it is by definition a base-$2$ Fermat pseudoprime.\n\nThe structural reason for this is as follows: Let $n = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ be a product of distinct primes, where each $p_i$ is a divisor of $\\Phi_L(a)$ for a prime $L$. As shown, this implies $\\operatorname{ord}_{p_i}(a)=L$ and $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod L$ for all $i$.\nThen $n = \\prod_{i=1}^k p_i \\equiv \\prod_{i=1}^k 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod L$.\nThis means $n-1$ is a multiple of $L$. Let $n-1 = m L$.\nTo check if $a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, we check modulo each $p_i$:\n$a^{n-1} = a^{mL} = (a^L)^m$\nSince $\\operatorname{ord}_{p_i}(a)=L$, we have $a^L \\equiv 1 \\pmod {p_i}$.\nThus, $(a^L)^m \\equiv 1^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod {p_i}$ for each $i$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$.\n\nThe final task is to report the smallest such composite $n$. Given the constraints $a=2$ and $L=11$, the only prime factors we can use are $23$ and $89$. The problem requires $n$ to be a product of at least two distinct primes.
