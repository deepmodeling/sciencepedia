The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of Quadratic Residues Modulo 13**\nA nonzero integer $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ if the congruence $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ has a solution for $x$. We compute the squares of all nonzero elements in the ring of integers modulo $13$, which is the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^2 = 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^2 = 9 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$4^2 = 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$6^2 = 36 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\nFor the remaining values, we can use the identity $(p-x)^2 \\equiv (-x)^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{p}$.\n$7^2 \\equiv (13-6)^2 \\equiv 6^2 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\n$8^2 \\equiv (13-5)^2 \\equiv 5^2 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$9^2 \\equiv (13-4)^2 \\equiv 4^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$10^2 \\equiv (13-3)^2 \\equiv 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$11^2 \\equiv (13-2)^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$12^2 \\equiv (13-1)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n\nThe set of distinct nonzero values obtained is the set of quadratic residues modulo $13$.\nLet $QR_{13}$ be this set.\n$QR_{13} = \\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$.\nThere are $|QR_{13}| = 6$ quadratic residues, which agrees with the theoretical result that there are $\\frac{p-1}{2} = \\frac{13-1}{2} = 6$ quadratic residues modulo a prime $p$.\n\n**Part 2: Justification from First Principles**\nThe problem requires justifying the values of the Legendre symbol based on foundational results. We use Euler's criterion, which states that for an odd prime $p$ and an integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) \\equiv a^{(p-1)/2} \\pmod{p}$. The values of the Legendre symbol are restricted to $\\{-1, 1\\}$.\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer $a$ such that $p \\nmid a$, we have $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nWe can rewrite this as $a^{p-1}-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. Factoring the left side gives:\n$(a^{(p-1)/2} - 1)(a^{(p-1)/2} + 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p$ is a prime, this implies that either $p | (a^{(p-1)/2} - 1)$ or $p | (a^{(p-1)/2} + 1)$.\nThis means $a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ or $a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nCase 1: $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\nBy definition, there exists an integer $x$ with $p \\nmid x$ such that $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression from Euler's criterion:\n$a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv (x^2)^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv x^{p-1} \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p \\nmid x$, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nThus, if $a$ is a quadratic residue, $a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nAccording to Euler's criterion, $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Since the only possible values for the symbol are $1$ and $-1$, we must have $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = 1$.\n\nCase 2: $a$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$.\nThe congruence $X^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ is a polynomial congruence of degree $\\frac{p-1}{2}$. By Lagrange's theorem, it can have at most $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ incongruent solutions modulo $p$.\nWe have already shown that all $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ quadratic residues are solutions to this congruence.\nTherefore, the solutions to $X^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ are precisely the quadratic residues.\nAny other nonzero integer $a$ modulo $p$ (i.e., a quadratic non-residue) cannot satisfy this congruence. It must therefore satisfy the only other possibility derived from Fermat's Little Theorem:\n$a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\nBy Euler's criterion, this means $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = -1$.\nThis completes the justification.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of Legendre Symbols for p=13**\nUsing the definition of the Legendre symbol and the set of quadratic residues found in Part 1, we can determine the value of $\\left(\\frac{a}{13}\\right)$ for each $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\nThe quadratic residues are $QR_{13} = \\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$. For these values of $a$, $\\left(\\frac{a}{13}\\right) = 1$.\nThe quadratic non-residues are the remaining elements in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$:\n$QNR_{13} = \\{2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11\\}$. For these values of $a$, $\\left(\\frac{a}{13}\\right) = -1$.\n\nWe list the values in increasing order of $a$:\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $1 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{2}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $2 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{3}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $3 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{4}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $4 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $5 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{6}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $6 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{7}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $7 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{8}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $8 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{9}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $9 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{10}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $10 \\in QR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{11}{13}\\right) = -1$ since $11 \\in QNR_{13}$.\n- $\\left(\\frac{12}{13}\\right) = 1$ since $12 \\in QR_{13}$.\n\nThese values are to be presented in a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3088796"}, {"introduction": "Calculating residues by squaring every number is infeasible for large primes, which is where the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity demonstrates its true power by providing an elegant and efficient algorithm for computation.

The congruence $L \\equiv R \\pmod p$ implies that $p$ must divide $L-R$. The possible values for $L-R$ are $-2$, $0$, and $2$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $p \\ge 3$, and thus $p$ cannot divide either $-2$ or $2$. The only possibility is that $L-R=0$, which implies $L=R$.
