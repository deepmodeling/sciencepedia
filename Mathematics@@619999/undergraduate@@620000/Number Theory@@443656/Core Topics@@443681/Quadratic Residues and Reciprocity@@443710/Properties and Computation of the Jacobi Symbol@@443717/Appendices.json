We will perform this computation in two ways as requested.\n\n(a) Direct computation using the supplementary law for the Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right)$.\nFor any odd positive integer $n$, the second supplementary law of quadratic reciprocity provides the value of the Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right)$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{n^2-1}{8}} $$\nIn this problem, $n=105$. We first compute the exponent $\\frac{n^2-1}{8}$.\n$$ n^2 = 105^2 = 11025 $$\n$$ n^2 - 1 = 11025 - 1 = 11024 $$\nNow, we compute the value of the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{n^2-1}{8} = \\frac{11024}{8} = 1378 $$\nSince the exponent is an even integer, the value of the Jacobi symbol is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{2}{105}\\right) = (-1)^{1378} = 1 $$\nAlternatively, the value of $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right)$ depends on the congruence class of $n$ modulo $8$.

We check the congruence class of $n=105$ modulo $8$:\n$$ 105 = 13 \\times 8 + 1 $$\nThus, $105 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.

The denominator, $n=899$, is a positive odd integer. The numerator is $a=98765$.\n\nThe first step is to reduce the numerator modulo the denominator. This is justified by the property that if $a \\equiv b \\pmod n$, then $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{n}\\right)$. This property is a direct consequence of the definition of the Jacobi symbol, $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\frac{a}{p_{i}}\\right)^{e_{i}}$, and the fact that the value of the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ depends only on the residue class of $a$ modulo $p$. We perform the division of $98765$ by $899$:\n$$98765 = 109 \\times 899 + 774$$\nThus, $98765 \\equiv 774 \\pmod{899}$. The Jacobi symbol can be rewritten as:\n$$\\left(\\frac{98765}{899}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{774}{899}\\right)$$\n\nThe next step is to use the multiplicative property of the Jacobi symbol in the numerator, which states that $\\left(\\frac{ab}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{n}\\right)$. This property also follows from the definition of the Jacobi symbol and the corresponding property for Legendre symbols. We factor the numerator, $774$:\n$$774 = 2 \\times 387 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 129 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 43 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 43$$\nApplying the multiplicative property, we get:\n$$\\left(\\frac{774}{899}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 3^2 \\times 43}{899}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{899}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3^2}{899}\\right)\\left(\\frac{43}{899}\\right)$$\n\nWe now evaluate each of these symbols separately.\n\nFor $\\left(\\frac{3^2}{899}\\right)$: The property $\\left(\\frac{m^2}{n}\\right)=1$ holds whenever $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Since the sum of the digits of $899$ is $8+9+9=26$, which is not divisible by $3$, $899$ is not divisible by $3$. Thus, $\\gcd(3, 899)=1$. Therefore:\n$$\\left(\\frac{3^2}{899}\\right) = 1$$\n\nFor $\\left(\\frac{2}{899}\\right)$: We use the second supplementary law for the Jacobi symbol, which states that $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{n^2-1}{8}}$. The value depends on $n \\pmod 8$. We find the residue of $899$ modulo $8$:\n$$899 = 8 \\times 112 + 3 \\implies 899 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$$\nFor $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$, the exponent $\\frac{n^2-1}{8}$ is odd. Specifically, if $n=8k+3$, then \n$$ \\frac{(8k+3)^2-1}{8} = \\frac{64k^2+48k+9-1}{8} = 8k^2+6k+1 $$\nwhich is odd. Thus:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2}{899}\\right) = (-1)^{\\text{odd}} = -1$$\n\nFor $\\left(\\frac{43}{899}\\right)$: We use the law of quadratic reciprocity for Jacobi symbols. For odd integers $m$ and $n$ with $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, the law states $\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n}{m}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{m-1}{2}\\frac{n-1}{2}}$. Here, $m=43$ and $n=899$. Both are odd. $43$ is a prime number, and $899 = 20 \\times 43 + 39$, so $\\gcd(43, 899) = \\gcd(43, 39)=1$. We evaluate the exponent:\n$$\\frac{m-1}{2} = \\frac{43-1}{2} = 21 \\quad (\\text{odd})$$\n$$\\frac{n-1}{2} = \\frac{899-1}{2} = 449 \\quad (\\text{odd})$$\nThe product of two odd numbers is odd, so the exponent $\\frac{m-1}{2}\\frac{n-1}{2}$ is odd. Therefore:\n$$\\left(\\frac{43}{899}\\right)\\left(\\frac{899}{43}\\right) = (-1)^{21 \\times 449} = -1$$\nThis implies $\\left(\\frac{43}{899}\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{899}{43}\\right)$. We now compute $\\left(\\frac{899}{43}\\right)$.
