The conditions for a non-zero Jacobi symbol are satisfied.\n\nAs per the problem's instruction, we proceed by using the prime factorization of $1001$. The definition of the Jacobi symbol for a composite denominator $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$ is $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{p_1}\\right)^{k_1} \\left(\\frac{a}{p_2}\\right)^{k_2} \\cdots \\left(\\frac{a}{p_r}\\right)^{k_r}$.

The terms on the right-hand side are Legendre symbols because $7$, $11$, and $13$ are prime numbers. We compute each Legendre symbol separately.\n\n1.

This strategy is then employed to evaluate the specific example $\\left(\\frac{12345}{2021}\\right)$.\n\n**Part 1: A General Computation Strategy for the Jacobi Symbol**\n\nLet $a$ and $n$ be odd, coprime positive integers. We seek to compute the value of the Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)$, which is guaranteed to be either $1$ or $-1$. The strategy is an algorithm that recursively reduces the complexity of the symbol's arguments until its value can be determined directly. The algorithm is based on the following properties:\n1.  If $a \\equiv b \\pmod{n}$, then $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{n}\\right)$.\n2.  $\\left(\\frac{ab}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{n}\\right)$.\n3.  $\\left(\\frac{-1}{n}\\right) = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}$.\n4.  $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) = (-1)^{(n^2-1)/8}$.\n5.  For odd, coprime positive integers $m$ and $n$, $\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n}{m}\\right) = (-1)^{((m-1)/2)((n-1)/2)}$.\n\nThe computational algorithm proceeds as follows when given a symbol $\\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right)$ to evaluate:\n\n**Step 1: Reduce the numerator.**\nIf $k \\ge m$, replace $k$ by $k' = k \\pmod{m}$. By property (1), $\\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{k'}{m}\\right)$. This step ensures the numerator is smaller than the denominator. The problem reduces to computing $\\left(\\frac{k'}{m}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 2: Handle trivial numerators.**\nIf the numerator $k$ becomes $1$, the symbol $\\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)$ is $1$ by definition, and this branch of the computation terminates. If the numerator $k$ is a perfect square, say $k=s^2$, then $\\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{s^2}{m}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{s}{m}\\right)^2 = 1$, since $\\gcd(s, m) = 1$ ensures $\\left(\\frac{s}{m}\\right) \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Factor out powers of $2$.**\nIf the numerator $k$ is an even number, write it as $k = 2^s \\cdot t$, where $t$ is odd and $s \\ge 1$. Using the multiplicativity property (2), we have:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^s t}{m}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{m}\\right)^s \\left(\\frac{t}{m}\\right) $$\nThe value of $\\left(\\frac{2}{m}\\right)$ is determined by the supplementary law (4). It is $1$ if $m \\equiv 1, 7 \\pmod{8}$ and $-1$ if $m \\equiv 3, 5 \\pmod{8}$. The task is then reduced to computing the symbol $\\left(\\frac{t}{m}\\right)$, which now has an odd numerator.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.**\nIf the numerator $k$ is odd and $1 < k < m$, property (5) is used to \"flip\" the symbol:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{m}{k}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{k-1}{2} \\frac{m-1}{2}} $$\nThe sign factor $(-1)^{\\frac{k-1}{2} \\frac{m-1}{2}}$ equals $-1$ if and only if both $k$ and $m$ are congruent to $3 \\pmod{4}$; otherwise, it is $1$. The problem is now reduced to computing $\\left(\\frac{m}{k}\\right)$.\n\n**Termination:** The algorithm always terminates. Each application of Step 4 replaces a symbol $\\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right)$ with $\\left(\\frac{m}{k}\\right)$, which after reduction via Step 1 becomes $\\left(\\frac{m \\pmod{k}}{k}\\right)$. The new denominator, $k$, is strictly smaller than the previous denominator, $m$. This creates a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integer denominators, which must eventually reach $1$. The Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{a'}{1}\\right)$ is defined to be $1$, so the process halts. The final value is the product of all sign factors accumulated.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of $\\left(\\frac{12345}{2021}\\right)$**\n\nWe apply the described strategy to compute $\\left(\\frac{12345}{2021}\\right)$. The integers $a=12345$ and $n=2021$ are positive and odd. The prime factorization of $a$ is $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 823$ and that of $n$ is $43 \\cdot 47$. They are coprime.\n\n1.  **Reduce the numerator:** Since $12345 > 2021$, we find the remainder of $12345$ divided by $2021$.\n    $$ 12345 = 6 \\cdot 2021 + 219 $$\n    By the property of invariance under reduction modulo $n$,\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{12345}{2021}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{219}{2021}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Apply Quadratic Reciprocity:** We now have the symbol $\\left(\\frac{219}{2021}\\right)$, where both integers are odd and $219  2021$. We use the law of quadratic reciprocity:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{219}{2021}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2021}{219}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{219-1}{2} \\frac{2021-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{2021}{219}\\right) (-1)^{109 \\cdot 1010} $$\n    Since the exponent $109 \\cdot 1010$ is even, the sign factor is $1$. Alternatively, we check the integers modulo $4$.\n    $219 = 4 \\cdot 54 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n    $2021 = 4 \\cdot 505 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n    Since only one of them is congruent to $3 \\pmod{4}$, the sign factor is $1$. Therefore,\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{219}{2021}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2021}{219}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Reduce the numerator:** For $\\left(\\frac{2021}{219}\\right)$, we find the remainder of $2021$ divided by $219$.\n    $$ 2021 = 9 \\cdot 219 + 50 $$\n    Thus,\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{2021}{219}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{50}{219}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Factor the numerator:** The numerator $50$ is even. We factor it as $50 = 2 \\cdot 25$. Using the multiplicativity property, we get:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{50}{219}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 \\cdot 25}{219}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{219}\\right) \\left(\\frac{25}{219}\\right) $$\n    We evaluate each symbol separately.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the components:**\n    -   For $\\left(\\frac{2}{219}\\right)$, we use the supplementary law, which depends on $219 \\pmod{8}$.\n        $$ 219 = 27 \\cdot 8 + 3 \\implies 219 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8} $$\n        For an integer $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$, the law states $\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) = -1$. So,\n        $$ \\left(\\frac{2}{219}\\right) = -1 $$\n    -   For $\\left(\\frac{25}{219}\\right)$, the numerator is a perfect square, $25=5^2$.\n        $$ \\left(\\frac{25}{219}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5^2}{219}\\right) $$\n        Since $\\gcd(5, 219)=1$ (as $219 = 3 \\cdot 73$), this symbol evaluates to $1$. This follows from multiplicativity, as $\\left(\\frac{5^2}{219}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{219}\\right)^2$, and the square of $1$ or $-1$ is $1$.\n        $$ \\left(\\frac{25}{219}\\right) = 1 $$\n\n6.  **Combine results:** We substitute the values back into the expression from Step 4.\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{50}{219}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{219}\\right) \\left(\\frac{25}{219}\\right) = (-1)(1) = -1 $$\n\nTracing our steps back, we have:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{12345}{2021}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{219}{2021}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2021}{219}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{50}{219}\\right) = -1 $$\nThe exact integer value of the Jacobi symbol is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3091696"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall is to assume that if the Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)$ equals $1$, then $a$ must be a quadratic residue modulo the composite number $n$.
