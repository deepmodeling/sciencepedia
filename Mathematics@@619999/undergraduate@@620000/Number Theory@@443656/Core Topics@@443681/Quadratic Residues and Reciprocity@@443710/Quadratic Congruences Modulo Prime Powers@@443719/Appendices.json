Substituting this into our divisibility relation gives:\n$$169 | (x - 1)(x + 1)$$\nWe are also given that the modulus is $169 = 13^{2}$, where $13$ is an odd prime number. So, the condition becomes:\n$$13^{2} | (x - 1)(x + 1)$$\nThis means that the product of the two integers $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$ must be divisible by $13^{2}$. Let's analyze the properties of these two factors. The difference between them is:\n$$(x + 1) - (x - 1) = 2$$\nLet $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$, denoted as $d = \\gcd(x-1, x+1)$. A fundamental property of the greatest common divisor is that it must divide any integer linear combination of the two numbers. In particular, it must divide their difference.\n$$d | ((x+1) - (x-1)) \\implies d | 2$$\nSince $d$ divides $2$, the only possible positive values for $d$ are $1$ and $2$.\nThe prime number in our modulus is $p=13$. The problem explicitly states that $13$ is an odd prime. Since $13$ is odd, it does not divide $2$.\n$$13 \\nmid 2$$\nThis implies that $13$ cannot be a common divisor of $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$, because any common divisor must divide $d$, and $d$ is either $1$ or $2$. Thus, $\\gcd(x-1, x+1)$ cannot be a multiple of $13$.\n\nNow we return to the condition $13^{2} | (x - 1)(x + 1)$. Since $13$ is a prime number, Euclid's lemma and its generalizations apply. For the product $(x-1)(x+1)$ to be divisible by $13^2$, the two factors of $13$ must be distributed between the terms $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$. However, we have just proven that $13$ cannot divide both $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$ simultaneously. Therefore, the entire factor of $13^{2}$ must divide a single term. This leads to two mutually exclusive cases:\n\nCase 1: The entire factor of $13^2$ divides $(x-1)$.\nIn this case, we have $13^{2} | (x-1)$, which is $169 | (x-1)$.\nBy the definition of congruence, this is equivalent to:\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{169}$$\n\nCase 2: The entire factor of $13^2$ divides $(x+1)$.\nIn this case, we have $13^{2} | (x+1)$, which is $169 | (x+1)$.\nBy the definition of congruence, this is equivalent to:\n$$x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{169}$$\n\nThese two cases cover all logical possibilities derived from the initial congruence and the properties of divisibility by the odd prime $13$.

If $x$ were an even integer, say $x=2k$ for some integer $k$, then its square would be $x^{2} = (2k)^{2} = 4k^{2}$. The expression $x^{2}-1$ would then be $4k^{2}-1$, which is an odd integer. An even number, such as $32$, cannot divide an odd number. Therefore, any solution $x$ must be an odd integer.\n\nSince $x$ is odd, both $x-1$ and $x+1$ are even integers. Furthermore, they are consecutive even integers. Let $x-1 = 2a$ and $x+1 = 2b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.\nThe condition $32 \\mid (x-1)(x+1)$ can be rewritten as $32 \\mid (2a)(2b)$, which simplifies to $32 \\mid 4ab$. Dividing both sides of the divisibility relation by $4$, we get $8 \\mid ab$.\n\nWe examine the relationship between $a$ and $b$. We have $(x+1) - (x-1) = 2$. Substituting our expressions for $x-1$ and $x+1$, we get $2b - 2a = 2$, which simplifies to $b-a=1$. This shows that $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers.\n\nA fundamental property of integers is that any two consecutive integers are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor is $1$. Thus, $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$.\n\nWe have the condition $8 \\mid ab$ together with the fact that $\\gcd(a,b)=1$. The prime factorization of $8$ is $2^{3}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, they share no common prime factors. Therefore, all the factors of $2$ in the product $ab$ must belong entirely to either $a$ or $b$. This leads to two mutually exclusive possibilities: either $8 \\mid a$ or $8 \\mid b$.\nIf $8$ divided both $a$ and $b$, then $\\gcd(a, b)$ would be at least $8$, which contradicts $\\gcd(a,b)=1$.

The modulus is $125 = 5^{3}$, where $p=5$ is a prime number. This problem is solvable using the technique of lifting solutions from modulo $p$ to modulo $p^k$, a method formalized by Hensel's Lemma.\n\nLet $f(x) = 2x^{2}+3x+1$. We seek to solve $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^3}$. The process begins by solving the congruence modulo $p=5$.\n\nStep 1: Solve the congruence modulo $5$.\nWe must find all $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ can be factored over the integers: $2x^2+3x+1 = (2x+1)(x+1)$.\nThus, the congruence becomes $(2x+1)(x+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nSince $5$ is a prime number, the modulus is a prime field $\\mathbb{Z}_5$. In a field, a product is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

To solve for $x$, we require the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $5$. Since $2 \\cdot 3 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, the inverse is $3$. Multiplying the congruence by $3$, we get $3 \\cdot 2x \\equiv 3 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $x \\equiv 12 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nSo, there are two solutions modulo $5$: $x_0 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ and $x_0' \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nStep 2: The Lifting Principle (Hensel's Lemma).\nThe problem requires justification for lifting solutions.

We seek a solution to $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{k+1}}$ of the form $x_{k+1} = r + tp^k$ for some integer $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\nBy definition, $f(r) = mp^k$ for some integer $m$. We substitute our new form for $x$ into the congruence:\n$$f(r+tp^k) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{k+1}}$$\nUsing a Taylor series expansion of $f(x)$ around $r$:\n$$f(r+tp^k) = f(r) + f'(r)(tp^k) + \\frac{f''(r)}{2}(tp^k)^2 + \\dots$$\nModulo $p^{k+1}$, and for $k \\ge 1$, terms with $(p^k)^2$ and higher powers of $p^k$ are congruent to $0$. The expansion simplifies to:\n$$f(r+tp^k) \\equiv f(r) + tp^k f'(r) \\pmod{p^{k+1}}$$\nSubstituting $f(r) = mp^k$, we have:\n$$mp^k + tp^k f'(r) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{k+1}}$$\nDividing the entire congruence by $p^k$:\n$$m + t f'(r) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$$\nThis is equivalent to $t f'(r) \\equiv -m \\pmod p$, or $t f'(r) \\equiv -\\frac{f(r)}{p^k} \\pmod p$.\nThis linear congruence for $t$ has a unique solution if and only if $f'(r)$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$, which is true if and only if $f'(r) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. This is the nondegeneracy condition for a unique lift.\n\nStep 3: Verification of the Nondegeneracy Condition.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = 4x+3$.

The solution is of the form $x_1 = 2 + 5t$.\nWe must solve $t f'(2) \\equiv -\\frac{f(2)}{5} \\pmod 5$.\n$f(2) = 2(2^2)+3(2)+1 = 8+6+1 = 15$.\n$f'(2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.\nThe congruence for $t$ is $t \\cdot 1 \\equiv -\\frac{15}{5} \\pmod 5$, which is $t \\equiv -3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$.\nSo, the lifted solution is $x_1 = 2 + 5(2) = 12$. We now have $x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNext, we lift from modulo $25$ to modulo $125$. The solution is of the form $x_2 = 12 + 25t$.\nWe must solve $t f'(12) \\equiv -\\frac{f(12)}{25} \\pmod 5$.\nNote that $f'(12) = 4(12)+3 = 51 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$, as expected since $12 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$.\n$f(12) = 2(12^2)+3(12)+1 = 2(144)+36+1 = 288+37 = 325$.\nThe congruence for $t$ is $t \\cdot 1 \\equiv -\\frac{325}{25} \\pmod 5$, which is $t \\equiv -13 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$.\nSo, the lifted solution is $x_2 = 12 + 25(2) = 12+50 = 62$.\nThe first solution modulo $125$ is $x \\equiv 62 \\pmod{125}$.\n\nStep 5: Lifting the solution $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\nFirst, we lift from modulo $5$ to modulo $25$.

We now have $x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNext, we lift from modulo $25$ to modulo $125$. The solution is of the form $x_2' = 24 + 25t$.\nWe must solve $t f'(24) \\equiv -\\frac{f(24)}{25} \\pmod 5$.\n$f'(24) = 4(24)+3=99 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$.\n$f(24) = 2(24^2)+3(24)+1 = 2(576)+72+1 = 1152+73 = 1225$.\nThe congruence for $t$ is $t \\cdot 4 \\equiv -\\frac{1225}{25} \\pmod 5$, which is $4t \\equiv -49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.\nThis is the same congruence for $t$ as in the previous step, yielding $t \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$.\nSo, the lifted solution is $x_2' = 24 + 25(4) = 24+100 = 124$.\nThe second solution modulo $125$ is $x \\equiv 124 \\pmod{125}$.\n\nThe two solutions for $2x^{2}+3x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}$ are $x \\equiv 62 \\pmod{125}$ and $x \\equiv 124 \\pmod{125}$. The least non-negative residues are $62$ and $124$.\nWe can verify the second solution by noting $x=124 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{125}$.\n$f(-1) = 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0$, which is trivially congruent to $0$ modulo $125$.\nFor $x=62$, we have $2(62)+1=125 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}$.
