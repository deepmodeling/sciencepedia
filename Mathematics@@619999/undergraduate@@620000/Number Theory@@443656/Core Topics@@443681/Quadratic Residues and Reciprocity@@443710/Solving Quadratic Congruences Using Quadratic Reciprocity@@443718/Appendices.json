Then apply your criterion to $p=131$ to determine the value of $\\left(\\frac{5}{131}\\right)$. Your final answer must be the single value of $\\left(\\frac{5}{131}\\right)$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed mathematical problem in the field of number theory, based on established principles (the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity), with a clear and objective formulation. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem asks for two main tasks: first, to derive a criterion for the value of the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)$ for an odd prime $p \\neq 5$, based on the residue of $p$ modulo $5$; and second, to apply this criterion to the specific case where $p=131$.\n\nWe begin with the statement of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity (QRL). For two distinct odd primes $p$ and $q$, the QRL states:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2} \\frac{q-1}{2}}\n$$\nIn our problem, we are interested in $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)$. We are given that $p$ is an odd prime and $p \\neq 5$. The number $5$ is also an odd prime. Therefore, we can apply the QRL with $q=5$. Substituting $q=5$ into the QRL formula gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2} \\frac{5-1}{2}}\n$$\nWe can simplify the exponent on the right-hand side. The term $\\frac{5-1}{2}$ evaluates to $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2} \\cdot 2} = (-1)^{p-1}\n$$\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $p$ can be written as $p = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$. Consequently, $p-1 = 2k$, which is an even integer. Any non-zero number raised to an even integer power is positive, so $(-1)^{p-1} = 1$.\nTherefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) = 1\n$$\nSince the Legendre symbol can only take values of $1$ or $-1$, this equation implies that $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)$ must be equal. If they were opposite, their product would be $-1$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)\n$$\nThis establishes a direct link between the value of $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)$ and the value of $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)$. The value of $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)$ depends on whether $p$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$. By definition, $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) = 1$ if $p$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$, and $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) = -1$ if $p$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $5$.\n\nTo determine this, we find the quadratic residues modulo $5$. We examine the squares of the non-zero elements of the ring of integers modulo $5$, which are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$:\n$$\n1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n$$\n$$\n2^2 = 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\n$$\n$$\n3^2 = 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\n$$\n$$\n4^2 = 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n$$\nThe set of quadratic residues modulo $5$ is $\\{1, 4\\}$. The set of quadratic non-residues modulo $5$ is $\\{2, 3\\}$.\nTherefore, we can establish the value of $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)$ based on the residue of $p$ modulo $5$:\n- If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ or $p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, then $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)=1$.\n- If $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ or $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, then $\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)=-1$.\n\nSince we have shown that $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)$, this gives us the desired criterion for $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)$:\n- The congruence $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{p}$ has solutions, i.e., $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)=1$, if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ or $p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n- The congruence $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{p}$ has no solutions, i.e., $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)=-1$, if and only if $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ or $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\nThis can be written more concisely as $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)=1$ if $p \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{5}$ and $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)=-1$ if $p \\equiv \\pm 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nNow, we apply this criterion to the case $p=131$. First, we confirm that $p=131$ is an odd prime not equal to $5$. This is true. Next, we determine the residue of $131$ modulo $5$:\n$$\n131 = 5 \\times 26 + 1\n$$\nThus, $131 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nAccording to our derived criterion, if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, then $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)=1$.\nTherefore, for $p=131$, we have:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5}{131}\\right) = 1\n$$\nThis means that $5$ is a quadratic residue modulo $131$, and the congruence $x^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{131}$ has solutions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3089923"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic reciprocity swap, this practice problem showcases the full power of the Legendre symbol algorithm.

The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information. The modulus $p=1000003$ is a prime number, which is a necessary condition for the Legendre symbol definition. The numerator $a=987654321$ is a well-defined integer. Thus, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe task is to evaluate the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ for $a=987654321$ and $p=1000003$.\n\nThe first step is to reduce the numerator $a$ modulo the prime $p$. The value of the Legendre symbol is unchanged by this operation, i.e., $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a \\pmod p}{p}\\right)$.\nWe perform the division of $a$ by $p$:\n$$987654321 = 987 \\times 1000003 + 651360$$\nTherefore, $a \\equiv 651360 \\pmod{1000003}$. The problem reduces to computing $\\left(\\frac{651360}{1000003}\\right)$.\n\nThe second step is to find the prime factorization of the new numerator, $651360$.\n$$651360 = 10 \\times 65136 = (2 \\times 5) \\times (2^4 \\times 4071)$$\nThe number $4071$ has a digit sum of $4+0+7+1=12$, which is divisible by $3$.\n$$4071 = 3 \\times 1357$$\nTo factor $1357$, we test small prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{1357} \\approx 36.8$.

Since $\\left(\\frac{k^2}{p}\\right) = 1$ for any $k$ not divisible by $p$, we have:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2^5}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 \\cdot 2^4}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 \\cdot (2^2)^2}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{(2^2)^2}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right)$$\nSo, the expression to evaluate is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{23}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{59}{p}\\right)$$\nWe now evaluate each of these symbols for $p=1000003$.\n\n1.  Evaluation of $\\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right)$:\n    We use the second supplementary law to the law of quadratic reciprocity: $\\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p^2-1}{8}}$. This value depends on $p \\pmod 8$.\n    $p = 1000003 = 10^6 + 3$. Since $1000$ is divisible by $8$, $10^6 = 1000^2$ is divisible by $8$.\n    Thus, $p = 1000003 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$.\n    For primes $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$, the value of the symbol is $-1$.\n    $$\\left(\\frac{2}{1000003}\\right) = -1$$\n\n2.  Evaluation of $\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right)$:\n    We use the law of quadratic reciprocity for odd primes $p$ and $q$: $\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{q-1}{2}}$.\n    Here, $q=3$. The law gives $\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{3-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\n    First, we find $p \\pmod 3$. The sum of the digits of $p=1000003$ is $1+3=4$. So, $p \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1$.\n    Next, we find $p \\pmod 4$. $p = 1000003 = 4 \\times 250000 + 3$, so $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n    This means $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ is an odd integer, so $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = -1$.\n    Combining these results: $\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\n    $$\\left(\\frac{3}{1000003}\\right) = -1$$\n\n3.

Thus, $\\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)$.\n    The value of $p \\pmod 5$ is determined by its last digit. $p=1000003$ ends in $3$, so $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5$.\n    We need to evaluate $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$. The quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 4$. Since $3$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $5$, $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=-1$.\n    $$\\left(\\frac{5}{1000003}\\right) = -1$$\n\n4.  Evaluation of $\\left(\\frac{23}{p}\\right)$:\n    Using quadratic reciprocity with $q=23$. Since $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ and $23 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, the exponent $\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{23-1}{2} = \\frac{p-1}{2} \\cdot 11$ is odd. The sign from reciprocity is $(-1)$.\n    $\\left(\\frac{23}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{23}\\right) (-1) = -\\left(\\frac{p}{23}\\right)$.\n    We must find $p \\pmod{23}$. $p = 10^6+3$.\n    $10^3 = 1000 = 43 \\times 23 + 11$, so $10^3 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{23}$.\n    Then $10^6 = (10^3)^2 \\equiv 11^2 = 121 \\pmod{23}$.\n    $121 = 5 \\times 23 + 6$, so $121 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{23}$.\n    Therefore, $p = 10^6+3 \\equiv 6+3 = 9 \\pmod{23}$.\n    So we need to evaluate $-\\left(\\frac{9}{23}\\right)$. Since $9=3^2$, it is a quadratic residue.\n    $\\left(\\frac{9}{23}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3^2}{23}\\right) = 1$.\n    $$\\left(\\frac{23}{1000003}\\right) = -(1) = -1$$\n\n5.  Evaluation of $\\left(\\frac{59}{p}\\right)$:\n    Using quadratic reciprocity with $q=59$.

The sign is $(-1)$.\n    $\\left(\\frac{59}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{59}\\right)(-1) = -\\left(\\frac{p}{59}\\right)$.\n    We must find $p \\pmod{59}$. $p = 10^6+3$.\n    $10^3 = 1000 = 16 \\times 59 + 56$, so $10^3 \\equiv 56 \\equiv -3 \\pmod{59}$.\n    Then $10^6 = (10^3)^2 \\equiv (-3)^2 = 9 \\pmod{59}$.\n    Therefore, $p = 10^6+3 \\equiv 9+3=12 \\pmod{59}$.\n    We evaluate $\\left(\\frac{p}{59}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{12}{59}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4 \\times 3}{59}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^2}{59}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{59}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{59}\\right)$.\n    To find $\\left(\\frac{3}{59}\\right)$, we apply reciprocity again. Both $3$ and $59$ are congruent to $3 \\pmod 4$, so the sign is $(-1)$.\n    $\\left(\\frac{3}{59}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{59}{3}\\right)(-1)$.\n    $59 = 19 \\times 3 + 2$, so $59 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    This gives $\\left(\\frac{59}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -1$.\n    So, $\\left(\\frac{3}{59}\\right) = (-1)(-1) = 1$.\n    This means $\\left(\\frac{p}{59}\\right) = 1$.\n    Finally, $\\left(\\frac{59}{p}\\right) = -(1) = -1$.\n    $$\\left(\\frac{59}{1000003}\\right) = -1$$\n\nFinally, we multiply all the individual results:\n$$\\left(\\frac{987654321}{1000003}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{23}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{59}{p}\\right)$$\n$$= (-1) \\times (-1) \\times (-1) \\times (-1) \\times (-1) = (-1)^5 = -1$$\n\nThe exact value of the Legendre symbol is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3089907"}, {"introduction": "The Legendre symbol is defined for prime moduli, but its generalization, the Jacobi symbol, extends to composite moduli.

We will proceed by analyzing the given conditions step-by-step. The integers $a$ to be considered are those between $1$ and $8$ inclusive which are coprime to $9$. The set of such integers is $\\{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8\\}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the condition on the Jacobi symbol, $\\left(\\frac{a}{9}\\right)=1$.\nThe definition of the Jacobi symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)$ for an odd integer $n > 1$ with prime factorization $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$ is given by the product of Legendre symbols:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{p_1}\\right)^{k_1} \\left(\\frac{a}{p_2}\\right)^{k_2} \\cdots \\left(\\frac{a}{p_r}\\right)^{k_r} $$\nIn our case, $n=9=3^2$. The prime factorization consists of a single prime $p_1=3$ with exponent $k_1=2$. Thus, the Jacobi symbol is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{a}{9}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 $$\nThe problem constrains $a$ such that $\\gcd(a, 9)=1$. This implies that $a$ is not a multiple of $3$, so $\\gcd(a, 3)=1$. For any integer $a$ where $\\gcd(a,3)=1$, the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)$ is defined and must be either $1$ (if $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $3$) or $-1$ (if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $3$).\nIn both of these cases, the square of the Legendre symbol is $1$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1 $$\nTherefore, for any integer $a$ satisfying $\\gcd(a,9)=1$, the condition $\\left(\\frac{a}{9}\\right)=1$ is automatically satisfied.

This is equivalent to the condition that the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = 1$.\nIn this problem, we have $p=3$ (an odd prime) and $k=2$, so $n=p^k=9$. The condition $\\gcd(a,9)=1$ ensures that $\\gcd(a,3)=1$. Applying the aforementioned principle, the congruence $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{9}$ has a solution if and only if $\\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)=1$.\nThe problem requires that $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{9}$ has *no* solution. Consequently, this is equivalent to the condition that $\\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)=-1$, meaning $a$ must be a quadratic non-residue modulo $3$.\n\nCombining our findings, the problem reduces to finding the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $1 \\leq a \\leq 8$, $\\gcd(a,9)=1$, and $\\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)=-1$.\nThe set of candidate values for $a$ is, in ascending order: $\\{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8\\}$.
