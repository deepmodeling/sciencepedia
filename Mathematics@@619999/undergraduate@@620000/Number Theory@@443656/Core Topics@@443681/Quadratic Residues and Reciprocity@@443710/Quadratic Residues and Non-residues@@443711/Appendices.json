For $p=13$, the set of nonzero residue classes is represented by the integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$. We are tasked with explicitly computing $a^2 \\pmod{13}$ for each $a$ in this set.\n\nThe computations are as follows:\n$1^2 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^2 = 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^2 = 9 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$4^2 = 16 = 1 \\times 13 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$5^2 = 25 = 1 \\times 13 + 12 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$6^2 = 36 = 2 \\times 13 + 10 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\n$7^2 = 49 = 3 \\times 13 + 10 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\n$8^2 = 64 = 4 \\times 13 + 12 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$9^2 = 81 = 6 \\times 13 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$10^2 = 100 = 7 \\times 13 + 9 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$11^2 = 121 = 9 \\times 13 + 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$12^2 = 144 = 11 \\times 13 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n\nCollecting the distinct values from these congruences, we find the set of nonzero quadratic residues modulo $13$. Let this set be denoted by $QR_{13}$.\n$QR_{13} = \\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$.\nThe number of elements in this set is $|QR_{13}| = 6$. For $p=13$, this number is indeed $\\frac{p-1}{2} = \\frac{13-1}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$.\n\nNext, we must justify from first principles why the number of distinct nonzero quadratic residues modulo an odd prime $p$ is exactly $\\frac{p-1}{2}$. The set of nonzero residues is the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has $p-1$ elements, represented by $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$. The quadratic residues are the image of the squaring map $f(a) = a^2$ on this group.\n\nFirst, observe that for any $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$, its square is the same as the square of $p-a$:\n$(p-a)^2 = p^2 - 2pa + a^2 \\equiv a^2 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $p \\ge 3$. For any $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$, $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. If $a \\equiv p-a \\pmod{p}$, then $2a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. Because $p$ is odd, $\\gcd(2,p)=1$, so we can multiply by the inverse of $2$ to get $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, a contradiction. Thus, $a$ and $p-a$ are distinct elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ that have the same square. This means that at most $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ distinct values can result from squaring all $p-1$ elements.\n\nTo show there are exactly $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ distinct values, we need to show that the squares of the first half of the elements are all distinct. Let us consider the set of integers $A = \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{p-1}{2}\\}$. We want to show that if $a, b \\in A$ and $a^2 \\equiv b^2 \\pmod{p}$, then $a=b$.\nThe congruence $a^2 \\equiv b^2 \\pmod{p}$ is equivalent to $a^2 - b^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, which factors as $(a-b)(a+b) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p$ is a prime number, this implies that $p$ must divide the product $(a-b)(a+b)$. By Euclid's Lemma, this means $p \\mid (a-b)$ or $p \\mid (a+b)$.\n\nLet's examine these two possibilities for $a, b \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{p-1}{2}\\}$:\nCase 1: $p \\mid (a-b)$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are in the specified range, the difference $a-b$ is bounded:\n$-(\\frac{p-1}{2}-1) \\le a-b \\le (\\frac{p-1}{2}-1)$.\nThis simplifies to $-\\frac{p-3}{2} \\le a-b \\le \\frac{p-3}{2}$.\nSince $p \\ge 3$, we have $\\frac{p-3}{2} < p$. The only integer multiple of $p$ in the interval $(-p, p)$ is $0$. Thus, $a-b=0$, which implies $a=b$.\n\nCase 2: $p \\mid (a+b)$.\nThe sum $a+b$ is also bounded:\n$1+1 \\le a+b \\le \\frac{p-1}{2} + \\frac{p-1}{2}$.\nThis simplifies to $2 \\le a+b \\le p-1$.\nThe sum $a+b$ is an integer strictly between $0$ and $p$. Therefore, it cannot be a multiple of $p$. This case is impossible.\n\nSince the only possibility is $a=b$, we conclude that for any two distinct elements $a,b$ from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{p-1}{2}\\}$, their squares modulo $p$ must be distinct. This proves that there are exactly $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ distinct nonzero quadratic residues modulo $p$. For $p=13$, this number is $\\frac{13-1}{2}=6$, confirming our explicit calculation.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute $S$, the sum of the distinct nonzero quadratic residues viewed as ordinary integers. The set of these residues for $p=13$ is $\\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$.\nThe sum $S$ is calculated as:\n$S = 1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 12$\n$S = (1+9) + (10) + (3+4) + 12$\n$S = 10 + 10 + 7 + 12$\n$S = 20 + 19$\n$S = 39$.\nThe sum of the distinct nonzero quadratic residues modulo $13$ is $39$. As a check, we can sum these residues modulo $13$: $1+3+4+9+10+12 \\equiv 1+3+4+(-4)+(-3)+(-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$. Our computed sum $S=39$ satisfies this, as $39 = 3 \\times 13$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{39}$$", "id": "3089093"}, {"introduction": "While direct computation is insightful for small primes, it quickly becomes impractical as the modulus grows.

In this case, $\\left(\\frac{a}{77}\\right) = 0$, which violates condition 1. Therefore, we must have $\\gcd(a, 77)=1$. This implies $\\gcd(a,7)=1$ and $\\gcd(a,11)=1$.
