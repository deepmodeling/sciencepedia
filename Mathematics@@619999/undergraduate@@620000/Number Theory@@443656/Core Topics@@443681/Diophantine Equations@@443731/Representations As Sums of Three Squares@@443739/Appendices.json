First, we must establish that any integer of the form $8k+7$ cannot be expressed as the sum of three integer squares. Second, we must find the smallest positive integer $n$ which is itself not a sum of three squares, but is the product of two integers that are sums of three squares.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of positive integers that can be written as the sum of three squares, i.e., $n \\in S$ if $n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ for some integers $x, y, z$.\n\nPart 1: Obstruction for integers congruent to $7$ modulo $8$.\n\nWe analyze the possible values of a squared integer, $k^2$, modulo $8$. Let $k$ be any integer.\nIf $k$ is even, then $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$. The square is $k^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2$.\n- If $m$ is even, let $m=2j$. Then $k=4j$, and $k^2 = (4j)^2 = 16j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n- If $m$ is odd, let $m=2j+1$. Then $k=2(2j+1) = 4j+2$, and $k^2 = (4j+2)^2 = 16j^2 + 16j + 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\nSo, if $k$ is an even integer, $k^2$ is congruent to either $0$ or $4$ modulo $8$.\n\nIf $k$ is odd, then $k=2m+1$ for some integer $m$. The square is $k^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 4m(m+1) + 1$. The product of two consecutive integers, $m(m+1)$, is always even. Let $m(m+1) = 2j$ for some integer $j$. Then $k^2 = 4(2j) + 1 = 8j+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\nSo, if $k$ is an odd integer, $k^2$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $8$.\n\nIn summary, any integer square $k^2$ must satisfy one of the following congruences:\n$$k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$$\n$$k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$$\n$$k^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$$\nThe set of possible quadratic residues modulo $8$ is $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\n\nNow, consider an integer $n \\in S$, such that $n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The value of $n$ modulo $8$ is the sum of three numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$. Let's enumerate all possible combinations for $x^2+y^2+z^2 \\pmod 8$:\n- $0+0+0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$\n- $0+0+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$\n- $0+0+4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$\n- $0+1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$\n- $0+1+4 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$\n- $0+4+4 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$\n- $1+1+1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$\n- $1+1+4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 8$\n- $1+4+4 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$\n- $4+4+4 \\equiv 12 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$\n\nThe set of possible values for a sum of three squares modulo $8$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The integer $7$ is not a possible value for this sum. Therefore, any integer $n$ such that $n \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$ cannot be written as the sum of three squares, and thus $n \\notin S$.\n\nPart 2: Finding the least integer $n$ such that $n=ab$ with $a,b \\in S$ but $n \\notin S$.\n\nAn integer $n$ is not in $S$ if it cannot be represented as a sum of three squares. From Part 1, we know that integers of the form $8m+7$ are not in $S$. Legendre's three-square theorem provides a complete characterization: a positive integer $n$ is not in $S$ if and only if $n$ is of the form $4^k(8m+7)$ for non-negative integers $k$ and $m$.\n\nWe are looking for the least positive integer $n$ such that $n \\notin S$ and $n=ab$ for some $a,b \\in S$.\nLet's list the smallest positive integers that are not in $S$ by considering the formula $4^k(8m+7)$:\n- For $k=0$, we get numbers of the form $8m+7$: $7, 15, 23, 31, 39, 47, 55, ...$ (for $m=0, 1, 2, ...$)\n- For $k=1$, we get numbers of the form $4(8m+7)$: $28, 60, 92, ...$ (for $m=0, 1, 2, ...$)\n- For $k=2$, we get numbers of the form $16(8m+7)$: $112, ...$ (for $m=0, ...$)\n\nThe list of positive integers not in $S$, in increasing order, begins: $7, 15, 23, 28, 31, 39, ...$. We will test these numbers in order to find the smallest one that is a product of two elements of $S$.\n\n1. Test $n=7$: Since $7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$, $7 \\notin S$. The only way to factor $7$ into a product of two positive integers is $7=1 \\times 7$. Let's check if $a=1$ and $b=7$ are in $S$.\n   - For $a=1$: $1 = 1^2+0^2+0^2$. Thus, $1 \\in S$.\n   - For $b=7$: As established, $7 \\notin S$.\n   Since not both factors are in $S$, $n=7$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n2. Test $n=15$: Since $15 = 8 \\times 1 + 7$, $15 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$, and thus $15 \\notin S$. The factor pairs of $15$ are $(1, 15)$ and $(3, 5)$.\n   - The pair $(1, 15)$ is invalid because $15 \\notin S$.\n   - Consider the pair $(3, 5)$. Let $a=3$ and $b=5$. We must check if $a, b \\in S$.\n     - For $a=3$: $3$ is not of the form $4^k(8m+7)$ (as $3 \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$). Thus $3 \\in S$. Explicitly, $3=1^2+1^2+1^2$.\n     - For $b=5$: $5$ is not of the form $4^k(8m+7)$ (as $5 \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$). Thus $5 \\in S$. Explicitly, $5=2^2+1^2+0^2$.\n   Both factors $3$ and $5$ are in $S$. Their product is $15$, which is not in $S$.\n   Therefore, $n=15$ satisfies all the required conditions.\n\nSince we are testing the candidates for $n$ in increasing order ($7, 15, ...$), and $15$ is the first candidate that fulfills the conditions, it must be the least such positive integer.\nThe existence of such a number demonstrates that the set $S$ is not closed under multiplication.\n\nThe least positive integer $n$ is $15$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{15}\n$$", "id": "3089635"}, {"introduction": "With the theoretical obstruction understood, we can now turn to the constructive side of the theorem: finding explicit representations.

We must first verify that such solutions exist, then demonstrate that none are primitive, and finally determine the constant value $k = \\nu_{2}(\\gcd(x,y,z))$ for any solution $(x,y,z)$. We will proceed using only the three facts provided.\n\nFirst, we establish that $n=320$ can be expressed as a sum of three integer squares. According to Fact (ii) (Legendre's three-square theorem), a positive integer $n$ is a sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form $4^{a}(8b+7)$ for non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. We examine $n=320$. We can write $320$ as $320 = 64 \\cdot 5 = 4^{3} \\cdot 5$. To see if $n$ is of the forbidden form, we would need to find $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ such that $320 = 4^{a}(8b+7)$. If such an $a$ existed, then $4^{a}$ must divide $320$. The prime factorization of $320$ is $2^{6} \\cdot 5$. Since $4^{a} = (2^{2})^{a} = 2^{2a}$, the possible values for $a$ are $0, 1, 2, 3$. We test each case:\n- If $a=0$, $320 = 8(40)$, so $320 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. This is not of the form $8b+7$.\n- If $a=1$, $320/4^{1} = 80 = 8(10)$, so $80 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. This is not of the form $8b+7$.\n- If $a=2$, $320/4^{2} = 20 = 8(2)+4$, so $20 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. This is not of the form $8b+7$.\n- If $a=3$, $320/4^{3} = 5 = 8(0)+5$, so $5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$. This is not of the form $8b+7$.\nSince for any possible value of $a$ for which $4^a$ divides $320$, the quotient $320/4^a$ is not of the form $8b+7$, $n=320$ cannot be written in the form $4^{a}(8b+7)$. Therefore, by Fact (ii), there exist integers $x, y, z$ such that $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} = 320$.\n\nNext, we show that no such representation can be primitive, meaning $\\gcd(x,y,z) \\neq 1$. Let $(x,y,z)$ be any integer solution to $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=320$. We analyze this equation modulo $4$. Since $320 = 4 \\cdot 80$, we have $320 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. The equation becomes $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\nAccording to Fact (i), the square of any integer is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$. Specifically, if an integer $k$ is even, $k=2m$, then $k^{2}=4m^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. If $k$ is odd, $k=2m+1$, then $k^{2}=4m^{2}+4m+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nFor the sum $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ to be congruent to $0 \\pmod 4$, where each term is either $0$ or $1 \\pmod 4$, the only possibility is that each term must be $0 \\pmod 4$. That is, $x^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, $y^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, and $z^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. This implies that $x$, $y$, and $z$ must all be even integers. Since $x, y, z$ are all even, $2$ is a common divisor, and thus $\\gcd(x,y,z)$ must be a multiple of $2$. This proves that $\\gcd(x,y,z) \\ge 2$, so no representation is primitive.\n\nNow we iterate this analysis to determine the precise power of $2$ that must divide $\\gcd(x,y,z)$.\nSince $x, y, z$ are all even, we can write $x=2x_{1}$, $y=2y_{1}$, and $z=2z_{1}$ for some integers $x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}$. Substituting these into the original equation gives:\n$(2x_{1})^{2} + (2y_{1})^{2} + (2z_{1})^{2} = 320$\n$4x_{1}^{2} + 4y_{1}^{2} + 4z_{1}^{2} = 320$\nDividing by $4$, we obtain a new equation for $(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})$:\n$x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2} + z_{1}^{2} = 80$\nWe repeat the analysis for this new equation. Modulo $4$, we have $x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2} + z_{1}^{2} \\equiv 80 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. By the same reasoning as before, this implies that $x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}$ must all be even.\nSo, we can write $x_{1}=2x_{2}$, $y_{1}=2y_{2}$, and $z_{1}=2z_{2}$ for integers $x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}$. Substituting again:\n$(2x_{2})^{2} + (2y_{2})^{2} + (2z_{2})^{2} = 80$\n$4x_{2}^{2} + 4y_{2}^{2} + 4z_{2}^{2} = 80$\nDividing by $4$:\n$x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} + z_{2}^{2} = 20$\nWe repeat the analysis a third time. Modulo $4$, we have $x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} + z_{2}^{2} \\equiv 20 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. This implies that $x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}$ must all be even.\nSo, we can write $x_{2}=2x_{3}$, $y_{2}=2y_{3}$, and $z_{2}=2z_{3}$ for integers $x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3}$. Substituting:\n$(2x_{3})^{2} + (2y_{3})^{2} + (2z_{3})^{2} = 20$\n$4x_{3}^{2} + 4y_{3}^{2} + 4z_{3}^{2} = 20$\nDividing by $4$:\n$x_{3}^{2} + y_{3}^{2} + z_{3}^{2} = 5$\n\nWe now analyze this final equation for the triple $(x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3})$. Let $g_{3} = \\gcd(x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3})$. According to Fact (iii), $g_{3}^{2}$ must divide the sum $x_{3}^{2}+y_{3}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}$, which is $5$. The integer divisors of $5$ are $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 5$. The only perfect square that is a divisor of $5$ is $1$. Thus, we must have $g_{3}^{2}=1$, which implies $g_{3}=1$. Therefore, any integer solution $(x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3})$ to $x_{3}^{2}+y_{3}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}=5$ must be primitive. For instance, $(1,2,0)$ is a solution, and $\\gcd(1,2,0)=1$.\n\nWe can now relate the $\\gcd$ of the original solution $(x,y,z)$ to the $\\gcd$ of $(x_{3},y_{3},z_{3})$.\nFrom our substitutions:\n$x = 2x_{1} = 2(2x_{2}) = 4x_{2} = 4(2x_{3}) = 8x_{3}$\n$y = 2y_{1} = 2(2y_{2}) = 4y_{2} = 4(2y_{3}) = 8y_{3}$\n$z = 2z_{1} = 2(2z_{2}) = 4z_{2} = 4(2z_{3}) = 8z_{3}$\nLet $g = \\gcd(x,y,z)$. Then $g = \\gcd(8x_{3}, 8y_{3}, 8z_{3}) = 8 \\cdot \\gcd(x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3})$.\nSince we have shown that for any solution $(x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3})$, $\\gcd(x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3}) = 1$, it follows that $g = 8 \\cdot 1 = 8$.\nThis demonstrates that for any integer triple $(x,y,z)$ satisfying $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=320$, the greatest common divisor $\\gcd(x,y,z)$ must be exactly $8$.\n\nThe final step is to find the value of $k = \\nu_{2}(\\gcd(x,y,z))$.\nSince $\\gcd(x,y,z) = 8$, we have $k = \\nu_{2}(8)$.\nThe prime factorization of $8$ is $2^{3}$. Thus, the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $8$ is $3$.\nSo, $k = 3$. This value is constant for every solution $(x,y,z)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3089681"}]}
