A key theorem in the theory of Pell's equation states that the negative Pell equation $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$ has integer solutions if and only if the period length $k$ of the continued fraction of $\\sqrt{D}$ is odd. Since we found $k=11$, which is an odd integer, the equation $x^2 - 61y^2 = -1$ is indeed solvable.\n\nNow, we deduce the fundamental solution $(x_1, y_1)$ of $x^2 - 61y^2 = 1$. When the period length $k$ is odd, the fundamental solution to $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$, let's call it $(x_f, y_f)$, is given by the $(k-1)$-th convergent of $\\sqrt{D}$, i.e., $(p_{k-1}, q_{k-1}) = (p_{10}, q_{10})$. We compute the convergents $p_n/q_n$ using the recurrence relations $p_n = a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}$ and $q_n = a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}$, with initial values $p_{-1}=1, p_{-2}=0$ and $q_{-1}=0, q_{-2}=1$.\n$a_0=7: p_0=7, q_0=1$\n$a_1=1: p_1=8, q_1=1$\n$a_2=4: p_2=4(8)+7=39, q_2=4(1)+1=5$\n$a_3=3: p_3=3(39)+8=125, q_3=3(5)+1=16$\n$a_4=1: p_4=1(125)+39=164, q_4=1(16)+5=21$\n$a_5=2: p_5=2(164)+125=453, q_5=2(21)+16=58$\n$a_6=2: p_6=2(453)+164=1070, q_6=2(58)+21=137$\n$a_7=1: p_7=1(1070)+453=1523, q_7=1(137)+58=195$\n$a_8=3: p_8=3(1523)+1070=5639, q_8=3(195)+137=722$\n$a_9=4: p_9=4(5639)+1523=24079, q_9=4(722)+195=3083$\n$a_{10}=1: p_{10}=1(24079)+5639=29718, q_{10}=1(3083)+722=3805$\nSo, the fundamental solution to $x^2-61y^2 = -1$ is $(x_f, y_f) = (29718, 3805)$. We can verify: $29718^2 - 61 \\cdot 3805^2 = 883159524 - 61 \\cdot 14478025 = 883159524 - 883159525 = -1$.\n\nTo find the fundamental solution $(x_1, y_1)$ of $x^2 - 61y^2 = 1$, we use the algebraic structure of the solutions. If $x_f+y_f\\sqrt{D}$ corresponds to a solution of $x^2-Dy^2=-1$, then its square, $(x_f+y_f\\sqrt{D})^2$, corresponds to a solution of $x^2-Dy^2=1$, since $(x_f^2-Dy_f^2)^2 = (-1)^2=1$.\nThe fundamental solution $(x_1, y_1)$ is obtained from the expansion:\n$x_1 + y_1\\sqrt{61} = (x_f + y_f\\sqrt{61})^2 = (29718 + 3805\\sqrt{61})^2$\n$x_1 + y_1\\sqrt{61} = (29718^2 + 61 \\cdot 3805^2) + (2 \\cdot 29718 \\cdot 3805)\\sqrt{61}$\nComparing the rational parts, we get $x_1 = x_f^2 + 61 y_f^2$.\nUsing our verification values, $x_1 = 883159524 + 883159525 = 1766319049$.\nThe y-coordinate is $y_1 = 2x_fy_f = 2 \\cdot 29718 \\cdot 3805 = 226153980$.\nThe fundamental solution is $(x_1, y_1) = (1766319049, 226153980)$.\n\nFinally, we justify why this solution is unusually large. The magnitude of the fundamental solution to $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$ is related to the period length $k$ of $\\sqrt{D}$'s continued fraction.\nIf $k$ were even, the fundamental solution would be $(p_{k-1}, q_{k-1})$.\nHowever, for $D=61$, the period length $k=11$ is odd. This has two consequences that lead to a large solution. First, the period length $11$ is relatively long, meaning the components of the convergent $p_{10}/q_{10}$ are already large numbers. Second, and more critically, the oddness of the period forces a \"squaring phenomenon\". The first positive solution to $x^2-61y^2=1$ is not $(p_{10}, q_{10})$ but is derived from it. The $(k-1)$-th convergent only gives the fundamental solution to the negative Pell equation, $x^2-61y^2=-1$. To get a solution for the positive Pell equation, we must effectively proceed to the end of the second period of the continued fraction, yielding the solution $(p_{2k-1}, q_{2k-1})=(p_{21}, q_{21})$. Algebraically, this corresponds to squaring the fundamental unit of the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{61})$ that has norm $-1$. Thus, the coordinates of the fundamental solution $(x_1, y_1)$ are quadratic in the already large coordinates of $(x_f, y_f)$, resulting in an exceptionally large value for $x_1$.\n\nThe final answer requested is the minimal positive $x$-coordinate, $x_1$.\n$x_1 = 1766319049$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1766319049}$$", "id": "3085362"}, {"introduction": "Long before the development of the continued fraction algorithm in Europe, Indian mathematicians devised a powerful and elegant method for solving Pell's equation known as the Chakravala, or \"cyclic,\" method.

The method starts with a triple of integers $(a, b, k)$ such that $a^{2}-D b^{2}=k$ for some non-zero integer $k$. The goal is to generate a sequence of such triples, $(a_i, b_i, k_i)$, where the values of $|k_i|$ are progressively reduced until a triple with $k_n=1$ is found.\n\nThe core of the method is based on the Brahmagupta identity:\n$$\n(x_1^2 - D y_1^2)(x_2^2 - D y_2^2) = (x_1 x_2 + D y_1 y_2)^2 - D (x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2\n$$\nThis identity shows that if we have two pairs $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ giving results $k_1$ and $k_2$ in the Pell-type form, their composition gives a new pair for the result $k_1 k_2$.\n\nThe Chakravala method cleverly composes the current solution $(a, b, k)$ with a trivial solution of the form $(m, 1)$, which satisfies $m^{2}-D(1)^{2} = m^{2}-D$. Applying Brahmagupta's identity to $(a, b)$ and $(m, 1)$ would give:\n$$\nk(m^2-D) = (am + Db)^2 - D(a+bm)^2\n$$\nThis is not the update rule itself, but it forms the foundation. The key insight is to construct a new, \"smaller\" solution by scaling. The one-step update rule is defined as follows: given a triple $(a, b, k)$ with $a^{2}-D b^{2}=k$, we find an integer $m$ and define a new triple $(a', b', k')$ by the relations:\n$$\na' = \\frac{am+Db}{|k|}, \\quad b' = \\frac{a+bm}{|k|}, \\quad k' = \\frac{m^2-D}{k}\n$$\nWe must first verify that this new triple satisfies the same form, i.e., $a'^{2} - D b'^{2} = k'$. Assuming for a moment that $a'$, $b'$, and $k'$ are integers, we have:\n$$\na'^{2} - D b'^{2} = \\left(\\frac{am+Db}{k}\\right)^2 - D \\left(\\frac{a+bm}{k}\\right)^2 \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{k^2} \\left[ (a^2m^2 + 2abDm + D^2b^2) - D(a^2 + 2abm + b^2m^2) \\right] \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{k^2} \\left[ a^2m^2 + 2abDm + D^2b^2 - Da^2 - 2abDm - Db^2m^2 \\right] \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{k^2} \\left[ m^2(a^2 - Db^2) - D(a^2 - Db^2) \\right] \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{k^2} \\left[ m^2k - Dk \\right] = \\frac{k(m^2-D)}{k^2} = \\frac{m^2-D}{k} = k'\n$$\nThis confirms the validity of the update rule, provided $a'$, $b'$, and $k'$ are integers.\n\nThe selection criterion for the integer parameter $m$ is designed to ensure two things: first, that $a'$, $b'$, and $k'$ are integers, and second, that the iteration makes progress by reducing $|k|$.\n\nFor $a'$, $b'$, $k'$ to be integers, the numerators in their definitions must be divisible by $k$.\nLet's analyze these divisibility conditions. We require:\n$1.$ $a+bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$\n$2.$ $am+Db \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$\n$3.$ $m^2-D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$\n\nLet's assume we start with a primitive solution, i.e., $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$. From $a^2-Db^2=k$, we have $\\gcd(b,k) = \\gcd(b, a^2-Db^2) = \\gcd(b, a^2)$. Since $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, we must have $\\gcd(b, a^2)=1$, so $\\gcd(b,k)=1$.\n\nWith $\\gcd(b,k)=1$, the congruence $a+bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$ (or $bm \\equiv -a \\pmod{|k|}$) has a unique solution for $m$ modulo $|k|$. Let's show that this single condition implies the other two.\nIf $a+bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$, then $a \\equiv -bm \\pmod{|k|}$.\nSubstitute this into the initial equation modulo $|k|$:\n$a^2 - Db^2 = k \\implies a^2 - Db^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$\n$(-bm)^2 - Db^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$\n$b^2m^2 - Db^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$\n$b^2(m^2-D) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$\nSince we established $\\gcd(b,k)=1$, we also have $\\gcd(b^2, |k|)=1$. Thus, we can divide by $b^2$ to get $m^2-D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$. This proves that condition $1$ implies condition $3$.\n\nNow, let's show conditions $1$ and $3$ imply condition $2$:\n$am+Db \\equiv (-bm)m+Db \\pmod{|k|} \\quad$ (using $a \\equiv -bm$)\n$\\equiv -bm^2+Db = -b(m^2-D) \\pmod{|k|}$\nSince $m^2-D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$, it follows that $-b(m^2-D) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$. This proves condition $2$.\n\nSo, the primary requirement for $m$ is to be a solution to the linear congruence $a+bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$. This yields a set of possible values for $m$ of the form $m = m_0 + n|k|$ for any integer $n$, where $m_0$ is a particular solution.\n\nTo drive $|k|$ towards $1$, we must choose the $m$ that makes the next $|k'| = |\\frac{m^2-D}{k}|$ as small as possible. This is achieved by choosing the integer $m$ from its congruence class that minimizes $|m^2-D|$. This means we should choose $m$ to be an integer close to $\\sqrt{D}$.\n\n**Part 2: Application to $D=26$**\n\nWe need to solve $x^2-26y^2=1$. Here, $D=26$.\nFirst, we need a natural initial choice for a triple $(a, b, k)$ satisfying $a^2-26b^2=k$. A good starting point is to choose $b=1$ and find an integer $a$ such that $a^2$ is close to $D=26$.\nIf we choose $a=5$, we get $5^2 - 26(1^2) = 25-26 = -1$. This gives the triple $(5, 1, -1)$. While this is a valid starting point, it immediately gives a solution to $x^2-26y^2=-1$, which short-circuits the demonstration of the full iterative method.\nTo better illustrate the process, we choose a different natural starting point. Let's try $a=6$ and $b=1$.\n$a^2-26b^2 = 6^2-26(1^2) = 36-26=10$.\nSo our initial triple is $(a_0, b_0, k_0) = (6, 1, 10)$. We have $\\gcd(6,1)=1$, as required.\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n- Current triple: $(a, b, k) = (6, 1, 10)$.\n- Selection of $m$:\n  $1.$ We must satisfy the congruence $a+bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$, which is $6+1 \\cdot m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$, or $m \\equiv -6 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$.\n  The possible values for $m$ are of the form $10n+4$, which are $\\{\\dots, -16, -6, 4, 14, \\dots\\}$.\n  $2.$ We must choose $m$ from this set to minimize $|m^2-D| = |m^2-26|$.\n     - For $m=4$, $|4^2-26| = |16-26| = 10$.\n     - For $m=-6$, $|(-6)^2-26| = |36-26| = 10$.\n     - For $m=14$, $|14^2-26| = |196-26| = 170$.\n     The minimum magnitude is $10$, achieved for $m=4$ and $m=-6$. The choice $m=-6$ would lead to $b'=(a+bm)/k = (6+1(-6))/10 = 0$, which is a trivial solution. We discard this and choose $m=4$ to continue the search for a non-trivial solution.\n- Calculate the new triple $(a', b', k')$ with $m=4$:\n  $a' = \\frac{am+Db}{|k|} = \\frac{6(4)+26(1)}{10} = \\frac{24+26}{10} = \\frac{50}{10} = 5$.\n  $b' = \\frac{a+bm}{|k|} = \\frac{6+1(4)}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1$.\n  $k' = \\frac{m^2-D}{k} = \\frac{4^2-26}{10} = \\frac{16-26}{10} = \\frac{-10}{10} = -1$.\n- The new triple is $(a_1, b_1, k_1) = (5, 1, -1)$. In the typical implementation one would make $a'$ positive, so let's say we choose the triple $(5, 1, -1)$ by taking absolute values of the numerators, which does not affect the equation since they are squared.\n  Actually, the standard rule is $a' = (am+Db)/|k|$, $b' = (a+bm)/|k|$. I've modified the derivation to use $|k|$ in the denominator to keep $a', b'$ positive. With $k=10$ and $m=4$, this is fine. With $k=-1$ in the next step, using $|k|$ will be important.\n\n**Termination and Final Solution:**\nThe iteration has yielded a triple with $k_1 = -1$. The algorithm terminates as we have found a solution to $x^2-26y^2=-1$, namely $(x,y)=(5,1)$.\nThe problem requires a solution to $x^2-26y^2=1$. We can obtain this from the solution for $k=-1$ by composing the solution $(5,1)$ with itself using Brahmagupta's identity (a process known as \"squaring\" in the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{26})$).\nLet $(a,b) = (5,1)$ such that $a^2-Db^2=-1$. Then:\n$(-1)^2 = (a^2-Db^2)^2 = (a^2+Db^2)^2-D(2ab)^2 = 1$.\nThe new solution $(X,Y)$ for the equation $X^2-DY^2=1$ is given by:\n$X = a^2+Db^2 = 5^2+26(1^2) = 25+26 = 51$.\n$Y = 2ab = 2(5)(1) = 10$.\nThus, the pair $(51, 10)$ is a solution to $x^2-26y^2=1$.\nCheck: $51^2-26(10^2) = 2601 - 26(100) = 2601-2600=1$.\nThis solution is the minimal positive integer solution (or fundamental solution) because it was derived from the fundamental solution of $x^2-26y^2=-1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal positive integer $x$, which is $51$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{51}$$", "id": "3085416"}]}
