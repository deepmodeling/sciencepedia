The solution will be constructed in three parts, followed by a final calculation, as stipulated. Each step is developed from foundational principles.\n\n### Part 1: Continued Fraction and Minimal Solution\n\nThe first step is to determine the periodic continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{3}$. We use the standard algorithm. Let $\\alpha_{0} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe integer part is $a_{0} = \\lfloor \\alpha_{0} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{3} \\rfloor = 1$.\nThe remainder is $\\alpha_{0} - a_{0} = \\sqrt{3} - 1$. We define $\\alpha_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$.\nTo simplify $\\alpha_{1}$, we rationalize the denominator:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{3 - 1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{2}.\n$$\nThe integer part of $\\alpha_{1}$ is $a_{1} = \\lfloor \\alpha_{1} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{1.732... + 1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.366... \\rfloor = 1$.\nThe next remainder gives rise to $\\alpha_{2}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{1} - a_{1}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{2} - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = \\sqrt{3} + 1.\n$$\nThe integer part of $\\alpha_{2}$ is $a_{2} = \\lfloor \\alpha_{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{3} + 1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.732... \\rfloor = 2$.\nFor the next step, we find $\\alpha_{3}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{3} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{2} - a_{2}} = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{3} + 1) - 2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{2}.\n$$\nWe observe that $\\alpha_{3} = \\alpha_{1}$. This means the sequence of coefficients $a_{i}$ will be periodic from this point forward. The sequence of coefficients is $a_{0} = 1$, $a_{1} = 1$, $a_{2} = 2$, $a_{3} = a_{1} = 1$, $a_{4} = a_{2} = 2$, and so on.\nThe continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{3}$ is therefore $[1; \\overline{1, 2}]$. The period of the purely periodic part is $k=2$.\n\nThe solutions to the Pell equation $x^{2} - D y^{2} = 1$ are found among the convergents $C_{n} = p_{n}/q_{n}$ of the continued fraction of $\\sqrt{D}$. A fundamental theorem states that if the period length $k$ is even, the minimal positive integer solution to $x^{2} - D y^{2} = 1$ is given by $(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (p_{k-1}, q_{k-1})$. If $k$ is odd, the minimal solution is $(p_{2k-1}, q_{2k-1})$.\n\nFor $D=3$, the period is $k=2$, which is an even number. Therefore, the minimal positive integer solution is given by the convergent $C_{k-1} = C_{1} = p_{1}/q_{1}$.\nWe compute the first few convergents using the recurrence relations $p_{n} = a_{n} p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}$ and $q_{n} = a_{n} q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}$, with initial values $p_{-2}=0$, $p_{-1}=1$, $q_{-2}=1$, $q_{-1}=0$.\nFor $n=0$: $a_{0}=1$.\n$p_{0} = a_{0}p_{-1} + p_{-2} = 1(1) + 0 = 1$.\n$q_{0} = a_{0}q_{-1} + q_{-2} = 1(0) + 1 = 1$.\nThe convergent is $C_{0} = 1/1$. We check the Pell equation: $1^{2} - 3(1^{2}) = -2 \\neq 1$.\nFor $n=1$: $a_{1}=1$.\n$p_{1} = a_{1}p_{0} + p_{-1} = 1(1) + 1 = 2$.\n$q_{1} = a_{1}q_{0} + q_{-1} = 1(1) + 0 = 1$.\nThe convergent is $C_{1} = 2/1$. We check the Pell equation: $2^{2} - 3(1^{2}) = 4 - 3 = 1$. This is a solution.\nSince the period $k=2$ is even, this first solution arising from the convergent $C_{k-1} = C_{1}$ is guaranteed to be the minimal positive integer solution.\nThus, the minimal positive integer solution is $(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (2, 1)$.\n\n### Part 2: Recurrence Relation from Norm Multiplicativity\n\nThe Pell equation $x^{2} - 3y^{2} = 1$ is related to the algebraic structure of the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ and its ring of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}] = \\{a+b\\sqrt{3} \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The norm map $N$ for this ring is defined as $N(a+b\\sqrt{3}) = (a+b\\sqrt{3})(a-b\\sqrt{3}) = a^{2} - 3b^{2}$.\nThe equation $x^{2} - 3y^{2} = 1$ is equivalent to finding elements $x+y\\sqrt{3}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$ with norm $N(x+y\\sqrt{3})=1$.\n\nA crucial property of the norm map is its multiplicativity: for any two elements $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, $N(\\alpha\\beta) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$. To show this from first principles, let $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\beta = c+d\\sqrt{3}$.\nTheir product is $\\alpha\\beta = (a+b\\sqrt{3})(c+d\\sqrt{3}) = (ac+3bd) + (ad+bc)\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe norm of the product is:\n$$\nN(\\alpha\\beta) = (ac+3bd)^{2} - 3(ad+bc)^{2}\n$$\n$$\n= (a^{2}c^{2} + 6abcd + 9b^{2}d^{2}) - 3(a^{2}d^{2} + 2abcd + b^{2}c^{2})\n$$\n$$\n= a^{2}c^{2} + 6abcd + 9b^{2}d^{2} - 3a^{2}d^{2} - 6abcd - 3b^{2}c^{2}\n$$\n$$\n= a^{2}c^{2} - 3a^{2}d^{2} - 3b^{2}c^{2} + 9b^{2}d^{2} = a^{2}(c^{2}-3d^{2}) - 3b^{2}(c^{2}-3d^{2})\n$$\n$$\n= (a^{2}-3b^{2})(c^{2}-3d^{2}) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta).\n$$\nThis property implies that if we have two elements with norm $1$, their product also has norm $1$. Let $(x_n, y_n)$ be a solution to the Pell equation, corresponding to the element $\\alpha_n = x_n + y_n\\sqrt{3}$ with $N(\\alpha_n)=1$. The minimal solution $(x_1, y_1) = (2,1)$ corresponds to the fundamental unit $\\epsilon = 2+\\sqrt{3}$, which has norm $N(\\epsilon) = 2^2 - 3(1^2) = 1$.\nWe can generate a new solution $(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$ by multiplying $\\alpha_n$ by $\\epsilon$:\n$$x_{n+1} + y_{n+1}\\sqrt{3} = \\alpha_{n+1} = \\epsilon \\cdot \\alpha_n = (2+\\sqrt{3})(x_n + y_n\\sqrt{3}).$$\nExpanding the product:\n$$x_{n+1} + y_{n+1}\\sqrt{3} = (2x_{n} + 3y_{n}) + (x_{n} + 2y_{n})\\sqrt{3}.$$\nBy equating the rational and irrational parts (since $\\{1, \\sqrt{3}\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$), we obtain the pair of recurrence relations:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = 2x_{n} + 3y_{n}\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} = x_{n} + 2y_{n}\n$$\nThis explains how the given recurrence arises from the multiplicative structure of the solutions.\n\n### Part 3: Verification of the Solution Identity\n\nWe are to verify that if the sequences $(x_{n}, y_{n})$ are generated by the given recurrence with $(x_{0}, y_{0}) = (1, 0)$, then $x_{n}^{2} - 3y_{n}^{2} = 1$ for all $n \\geq 0$. We use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:** For $n=0$, we have $(x_{0}, y_{0}) = (1, 0)$.\nThe identity gives $x_{0}^{2} - 3y_{0}^{2} = 1^{2} - 3(0)^{2} = 1$. The statement holds for $n=0$.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some integer $k \\geq 0$, the identity holds: $x_{k}^{2} - 3y_{k}^{2} = 1$.\n\n**Inductive Step:** We must show that the identity holds for $n=k+1$, i.e., $x_{k+1}^{2} - 3y_{k+1}^{2} = 1$.\nWe use the recurrence relations to express $x_{k+1}$ and $y_{k+1}$ in terms of $x_k$ and $y_k$:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = 2x_{k} + 3y_{k}\n$$\n$$\ny_{k+1} = x_{k} + 2y_{k}\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression $x_{k+1}^{2} - 3y_{k+1}^{2}$:\n$$\nx_{k+1}^{2} - 3y_{k+1}^{2} = (2x_{k} + 3y_{k})^{2} - 3(x_{k} + 2y_{k})^{2}\n$$\nExpand the squared terms:\n$$\n= (4x_{k}^{2} + 12x_{k}y_{k} + 9y_{k}^{2}) - 3(x_{k}^{2} + 4x_{k}y_{k} + 4y_{k}^{2})\n$$\nDistribute the factor of $-3$:\n$$\n= 4x_{k}^{2} + 12x_{k}y_{k} + 9y_{k}^{2} - 3x_{k}^{2} - 12x_{k}y_{k} - 12y_{k}^{2}\n$$\nCombine like terms:\n$$\n= (4x_{k}^{2} - 3x_{k}^{2}) + (12x_{k}y_{k} - 12x_{k}y_{k}) + (9y_{k}^{2} - 12y_{k}^{2})\n$$\n$$\n= x_{k}^{2} - 3y_{k}^{2}\n$$\nBy the inductive hypothesis, $x_{k}^{2} - 3y_{k}^{2} = 1$. Therefore, we have shown that $x_{k+1}^{2} - 3y_{k+1}^{2} = 1$.\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the identity $x_{n}^{2} - 3y_{n}^{2} = 1$ is true for all integers $n \\geq 0$.\n\n### Final Computation: Value of $x_{5}$\n\nWe compute the first few terms of the sequence $(x_{n}, y_{n})$ using the recurrence relations starting with $(x_{0}, y_{0}) = (1, 0)$.\n\nFor $n=0$: $(x_{0}, y_{0}) = (1, 0)$.\nFor $n=1$:\n$x_{1} = 2x_{0} + 3y_{0} = 2(1) + 3(0) = 2$.\n$y_{1} = x_{0} + 2y_{0} = 1 + 2(0) = 1$. So $(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (2, 1)$.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n$x_{2} = 2x_{1} + 3y_{1} = 2(2) + 3(1) = 7$.\n$y_{2} = x_{1} + 2y_{1} = 2 + 2(1) = 4$. So $(x_{2}, y_{2}) = (7, 4)$.\n\nFor $n=3$:\n$x_{3} = 2x_{2} + 3y_{2} = 2(7) + 3(4) = 14 + 12 = 26$.\n$y_{3} = x_{2} + 2y_{2} = 7 + 2(4) = 15$. So $(x_{3}, y_{3}) = (26, 15)$.\n\nFor $n=4$:\n$x_{4} = 2x_{3} + 3y_{3} = 2(26) + 3(15) = 52 + 45 = 97$.\n$y_{4} = x_{3} + 2y_{3} = 26 + 2(15) = 56$. So $(x_{4}, y_{4}) = (97, 56)$.\n\nFor $n=5$:\n$x_{5} = 2x_{4} + 3y_{4} = 2(97) + 3(56) = 194 + 168 = 362$.\nThe value of $x_{5}$ is $362$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{362}\n$$", "id": "3087954"}, {"introduction": "While the equation $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$ is always solvable for non-square $D$, the same is not true for its \"negative\" counterpart, $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$.

Let $\\xi_0 = \\sqrt{10}$. The partial quotients $a_k$ and complete quotients $\\xi_k$ are found iteratively.\n\nThe first partial quotient is $a_0 = \\lfloor \\xi_0 \\rfloor = \\lfloor\\sqrt{10}\\rfloor$.

We rationalize the denominator:\n$$ \\xi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10} - 3} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 3}{\\sqrt{10} + 3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 3}{10 - 9} = \\sqrt{10} + 3 $$\nThe second partial quotient is $a_1 = \\lfloor \\xi_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{10} + 3 \\rfloor = 3 + \\lfloor \\sqrt{10} \\rfloor = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n\nThe second complete quotient is given by $\\xi_2 = \\frac{1}{\\xi_1 - a_1} = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{10} + 3) - 6} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10} - 3}$.\n\nWe observe that $\\xi_2 = \\xi_1$. Since a complete quotient has repeated, the sequence of partial quotients becomes periodic from this point on. The sequence of partial quotients is $a_0=3$, $a_1=6$, $a_2=6$, ..., which means the continued fraction expansion is:\n$$ \\sqrt{10} = [3; 6, 6, 6, \\dots] = [3; \\overline{6}] $$\nThe purely periodic part is $[\\overline{6}]$. The length of this repeating block is $L=1$.\n\nPart 2: Justification of the Parity Criterion\n\nLet $D$ be a nonsquare positive integer. The simple continued fraction of $\\sqrt{D}$ is of the form $[a_0; \\overline{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_L}]$, where $L$ is the period length. Let the convergents of this continued fraction be denoted by $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}$.\n\nA fundamental result from the theory of continued fractions relates the convergents of $\\sqrt{D}$ to solutions of Pell-type equations. Let the complete quotients be $\\xi_k = \\frac{P_k + \\sqrt{D}}{Q_k}$. The terms $Q_k$ are positive integers satisfying the recurrence relations $P_{k+1} = a_k Q_k - P_k$ and $Q_{k+1} = \\frac{D-P_{k+1}^2}{Q_k}$, with initial conditions $P_0=0$ and $Q_0=1$. The sequence of pairs $(P_k, Q_k)$ becomes periodic for $k \\ge 1$. The period length $L$ is the smallest positive integer such that $Q_L=1$.\n\nThe key identity connecting the convergents to the terms $Q_k$ is:\n$$ p_{k-1}^2 - D q_{k-1}^2 = (-1)^k Q_k $$\nThis identity holds for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nWe are interested in the situation at the end of the first period, where $k=L$. Setting $k=L$ in the identity, we get:\n$$ p_{L-1}^2 - D q_{L-1}^2 = (-1)^L Q_L $$\nBy definition of the period length $L$ for the continued fraction of $\\sqrt{D}$, we have $Q_L=1$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n$$ p_{L-1}^2 - D q_{L-1}^2 = (-1)^L $$\nThis single equation provides the link between the period length $L$ and the solvability of the positive and negative Pell equations. The pair $(x, y) = (p_{L-1}, q_{L-1})$ is the fundamental (smallest positive integer) solution to either $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$ or $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$.\n\nWe can now analyze the two cases based on the parity of $L$:\n\nCase 1: $L$ is odd.\nIf $L$ is an odd integer, then $(-1)^L = -1$. The equation becomes:\n$$ p_{L-1}^2 - D q_{L-1}^2 = -1 $$\nThis shows that $(x,y) = (p_{L-1}, q_{L-1})$ is an integer solution to the negative Pell equation $x^2 - D y^2 = -1$. Therefore, if $L$ is odd, the equation is solvable.\n\nCase 2: $L$ is even.\nIf $L$ is an even integer, then $(-1)^L = 1$. The equation becomes:\n$$ p_{L-1}^2 - D q_{L-1}^2 = 1 $$\nIn this case, $(p_{L-1}, q_{L-1})$ is the fundamental solution to the positive Pell equation $x^2 - D y^2 = 1$. It is a deeper result of the theory that if the fundamental solution to the positive equation corresponds to an even period length $L$, then the negative Pell equation $x^2 - D y^2 = -1$ has no solution in integers. Any hypothetical integer solution to the negative equation would lead to a \"smaller\" unit in the ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ than the fundamental unit corresponding to $(p_{L-1}, q_{L-1})$, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, we have rigorously justified the parity criterion: the negative Pell equation $x^2 - D y^2 = -1$ is solvable in integers if and only if the period length $L$ of the simple continued fraction of $\\sqrt{D}$ is odd.\n\nPart 3: Conclusion for $D=10$\n\nFrom Part 1, we determined that for $D=10$, the simple continued fraction for $\\sqrt{10}$ is $[3; \\overline{6}]$. The period length is $L=1$.\n\nSince $L=1$ is an odd integer, we apply the criterion established in Part 2. The solvability of $x^2 - 10y^2 = -1$ is affirmed. Therefore, the parameter $S$ must be $1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer as a row matrix $(L \\ S)$.\nThe period length is $L=1$.\nThe equation $x^2-10y^2=-1$ is solvable, so $S=1$.\nThe final answer is $(1, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3020870"}, {"introduction": "The solutions to Pell's equation are not just pairs of integers; they are the keys to understanding the multiplicative structure of rings of integers in quadratic number fields.

Thus the simple continued fraction is\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{14} = [\\,3;\\,\\overline{1,2,1,6}\\,],\n$$\n\nwith period length $4$.\n\nLet $(p_{k}/q_{k})$ be the convergents defined by\n\n$$\np_{-2} = 0,\\quad p_{-1} = 1,\\quad p_{k} = a_{k} p_{k-1} + p_{k-2},\n$$\n\n\n$$\nq_{-2} = 1,\\quad q_{-1} = 0,\\quad q_{k} = a_{k} q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}.\n$$\n\nUsing $a_{0} = 3, a_{1} = 1, a_{2} = 2, a_{3} = 1, a_{4} = 6$, we get:\n- $k = 0$: $p_{0} = 3,\\, q_{0} = 1$.\n- $k = 1$: $p_{1} = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 4,\\, q_{1} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = 1$.\n- $k = 2$: $p_{2} = 2 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 11,\\, q_{2} = 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.\n- $k = 3$: $p_{3} = 1 \\cdot 11 + 4 = 15,\\, q_{3} = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 4$.\n- $k = 4$: $p_{4} = 6 \\cdot 15 + 11 = 101,\\, q_{4} = 6 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 27$.\n\nBy the continued fraction theory of Pell equations, if the period length is even, then the convergent at the end of the first period solves $x^{2} - 14 y^{2} = 1$. Indeed,\n\n$$\np_{3}^{2} - 14 q_{3}^{2} = 15^{2} - 14 \\cdot 4^{2} = 225 - 224 = 1,\n$$\n\nwhile earlier convergents yield $2$ or $-5$, not $1$. Therefore, the minimal positive solution is $(x,y) = (15,4)$.\n\nConsequently, the fundamental unit is\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon = x + y \\sqrt{14} = 15 + 4 \\sqrt{14}.\n$$\n\nIts norm is\n\n$$\nN(\\varepsilon) = (15 + 4 \\sqrt{14})(15 - 4 \\sqrt{14}) = 225 - 224 = 1.\n$$\n\nTo justify primitivity, note that units are precisely elements with norm $\\pm 1$, i.e., solutions to $x^{2} - 14 y^{2} = \\pm 1$. The periodic part has even length $4$, so the negative Pell equation $x^{2} - 14 y^{2} = -1$ has no solutions in integers, a standard consequence of the parity of the period. Hence every unit has norm $+1$ and corresponds to a solution of $x^{2} - 14 y^{2} = 1$. The minimal positive solution is $(15,4)$ found above, so there is no unit $\\varepsilon'$ with $1  \\varepsilon'  \\varepsilon$ generating the group. Thus $\\varepsilon$ is the fundamental unit.\n\nThe regulator is\n\n$$\nR = \\ln(\\varepsilon) = \\ln(15 + 4 \\sqrt{14}).\n$$\n\nFor numerical verification, compute $\\sqrt{14} \\approx 3.741657386773941$, giving\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon = 15 + 4 \\sqrt{14} \\approx 15 + 14.966629547095765 \\approx 29.966629547095765,\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\nR = \\ln(\\varepsilon) \\approx \\ln(29.966629547095765) \\approx 3.400084414.\n$$\n\nRounded to $7$ significant figures, this is $3.400084$.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental unit is $\\varepsilon = 15 + 4 \\sqrt{14}$, with $N(\\varepsilon) = 1$ and regulator $R = \\ln(15 + 4 \\sqrt{14}) \\approx 3.400084$ to $7$ significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15+4\\sqrt{14}}$$", "id": "3020868"}]}
