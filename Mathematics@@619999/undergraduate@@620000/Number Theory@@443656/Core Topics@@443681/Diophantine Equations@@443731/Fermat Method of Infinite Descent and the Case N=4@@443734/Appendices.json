By the well-ordering principle, there must be a solution $(x, y, z)$ for which the positive integer $z$ is minimal. This is the minimality hypothesis. The goal is to use this minimal solution to construct another solution $(x', y', z')$ with a positive integer $z' < z$, which contradicts the minimality of $z$ and thus proves that no solution can exist.\n\nLet us start with a minimal solution $(x,y,z)$, where we can assume without loss of generality that $x, y, z$ are positive integers.\nThe equation is $x^4 + y^4 = z^2$. Let $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$. The equation becomes $X^2 + Y^2 = z^2$. This means $(X, Y, z) = (x^2, y^2, z)$ is a Pythagorean triple.\n\nThe question concerns the step of making this triple primitive. Let's analyze the consequences of this triple *not* being primitive. This occurs if $\\gcd(X,Y,z) > 1$.\nFirst, consider the relationship between $\\gcd(x,y)$ and the primitivity of $(X,Y,z)$.\nLet $g = \\gcd(x,y)$. We can write $x = gx_1$ and $y=gy_1$ for some integers $x_1, y_1$ with $\\gcd(x_1, y_1) = 1$.\nSubstituting these into the original equation:\n$$ (gx_1)^4 + (gy_1)^4 = z^2 $$\n$$ g^4(x_1^4 + y_1^4) = z^2 $$\nThis implies that $z^2$ is divisible by $g^4$, and therefore $z$ must be divisible by $g^2$. Let $z = g^2 z_1$ for some integer $z_1$.\nSubstituting this for $z$:\n$$ g^4(x_1^4 + y_1^4) = (g^2 z_1)^2 = g^4 z_1^2 $$\nDividing by $g^4$, we get:\n$$ x_1^4 + y_1^4 = z_1^2 $$\nThis gives a new solution $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ to the original equation.\n\nIf $g > 1$, then $g^2 > 1$, and the new z-value is $z_1 = z/g^2 < z$. This contradicts the assumption that $z$ was the smallest possible positive integer. Therefore, for the minimal solution $(x,y,z)$, we must have $\\gcd(x,y)=1$.\n\nNow, let's see what $\\gcd(x,y)=1$ implies for the Pythagorean triple $(X,Y,z)=(x^2,y^2,z)$.\nIf $\\gcd(x,y)=1$, then $\\gcd(x^2, y^2)=1$, so $\\gcd(X,Y)=1$. For any Pythagorean triple $(u,v,w)$, if $\\gcd(u,v)=1$, it follows that the triple is primitive, i.e., $\\gcd(u,v,w)=1$. To see this, if a prime $p$ divides $u$ and $w$, then $p$ divides $w^2-u^2=v^2$, so $p$ must divide $v$. This would contradict $\\gcd(u,v)=1$.\nThus, if we start with a minimal solution $(x,y,z)$, it must follow that $\\gcd(x,y)=1$, which in turn implies that the Pythagorean triple $(x^2,y^2,z)$ is primitive.\n\nThis preliminary step is crucial. It justifies applying the classification of *primitive* Pythagorean triples to $(x^2, y^2, z)$, which is the entry point to the main part of the descent that ultimately constructs the smaller solution. The question frames this as \"removing common factors\". The logic above shows that if common factors existed, we could immediately construct a smaller solution. Hence, under the minimality assumption, no removable common factors can exist, meaning the triple must be primitive from the start.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. If $\\gcd(X,Y,z) > 1$, dividing $(X,Y,z)$ by this common divisor produces a new triple $(X',Y',z')$ with $X'^2 + Y'^2 = z'^2$ and $z' = z/\\gcd(X,Y,z) < z$, so $M$ strictly decreases. Therefore, under a minimality hypothesis on $z$, the triple $(X,Y,z)$ must be primitive, which is necessary to invoke the primitive Pythagorean classification and to construct a subsequent smaller $z$ that contradicts minimality.**\n\nLet's evaluate this statement based on our derivation.\nThe first sentence describes what happens if the triple $(X,Y,z)$ is not primitive. Let $d = \\gcd(X,Y,z) > 1$. Let $(X', Y', z') = (X/d, Y/d, z/d)$. Then $(X')^2+(Y')^2 = (X/d)^2 + (Y/d)^2 = (X^2+Y^2)/d^2 = z^2/d^2 = (z/d)^2 = (z')^2$. This is correct. Also, since $d>1$, we have $z' = z/d < z$, so the descent measure $M=z$ decreases.\nThe second sentence draws the correct conclusion from this fact. If a non-primitive triple leads to a reduction of $z$, then any solution that is minimal with respect to $z$ *must* correspond to a primitive triple. The statement correctly identifies that this primitivity is necessary to apply the classification theorem, which is the subsequent step in the proof that leads to the final contradiction. This option accurately describes the logic. The process of \"removing common factors\" is logically equivalent to arguing that a minimal solution forces the triple to be primitive.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Removing common factors can increase $M$ because the passage from squares to square roots changes scale in a way that may amplify $z$, so the descent must avoid normalization to preserve minimality.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The descent measure is $M=z$. Removing a common factor $d>1$ from the triple $(X,Y,z)$ results in a new triple $(X',Y',z')$ where $z' = z/d$. Since $d$ is a positive integer greater than $1$, $z' < z$, meaning $M$ strictly decreases. The claim that $M$ can increase is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Removing common factors is not required; the classification of Pythagorean triples applies equally to non-primitive triples, and the descent can proceed without affecting $M$.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple inaccuracies. While a classification for non-primitive triples exists—they are integer multiples of primitive triples, i.e., $(d(m^2-n^2), d(2mn), d(m^2+n^2))$—using it would significantly complicate the proof. The elegance and directness of the standard proof rely on the properties of the primitive case. More importantly, the claim that this process proceeds \"without affecting $M$\" is false. As shown, removing common factors necessarily decreases $M=z$. A descent argument, by definition, requires the measure to decrease.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. To preserve minimality, one should redefine the descent measure as $M = \\dfrac{z}{\\gcd(x,y)}$, ensuring that removing common factors leaves $M$ unchanged and avoids interfering with the descent step.**\n\nThis statement proposes a new measure and makes an incorrect claim about it. Let's analyze the behavior of $M' = z/\\gcd(x,y)$ when we reduce a non-coprime solution. As shown in the derivation, if $(x,y,z)$ is a solution with $g = \\gcd(x,y)>1$, we can construct a new solution $(x_1, y_1, z_1) = (x/g, y/g, z/g^2)$ with $\\gcd(x_1,y_1)=1$.\nThe original measure is $M'_{\\text{old}} = z/g$.\nThe new measure is $M'_{\\text{new}} = z_1/\\gcd(x_1,y_1) = (z/g^2)/1 = z/g^2$.\nSince $g>1$, we have $M'_{\\text{new}} = M'_{\\text{old}}/g < M'_{\\text{old}}$. The measure is not unchanged; it strictly decreases.

The equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$ is a specific case ($n=4$) of Fermat's Last Theorem. The method of infinite descent is a valid and historically significant proof technique used by Fermat to demonstrate that the more general equation $x^4 + y^4 = w^2$ has no solutions in positive integers.

The question is clear and unambiguous enough to be solved.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to be solved by someone familiar with the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for $n=4$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for the exponent $n=4$ proceeds by showing that a more general equation, $a^4 + b^4 = c^2$, has no solutions in positive integers. If this is true, then $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$ can have no solutions either, since if $(x, y, z)$ were a solution, then $(x, y, z^2)$ would be a solution to $a^4 + b^4 = c^2$, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe proof uses the method of infinite descent. Let's outline the argument for $a^4 + b^4 = c^2$.\n\n1.  **Assume a Solution Exists**: Suppose there exists a solution $(a, b, c)$ in positive integers. We can reduce any such solution to a primitive one where $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$. In a primitive solution, one of $a$ or $b$ must be odd and the other even.\n\n2.  **Form a Pythagorean Triple**: The equation can be written as $(a^2)^2 + (b^2)^2 = c^2$. This implies that $(a^2, b^2, c)$ is a primitive Pythagorean triple.\n\n3.  **Parametrize the Triple**: According to Euclid's formula for primitive Pythagorean triples, we can write the legs and hypotenuse in terms of two coprime integers $m$ and $k$ of opposite parity, with $m > k > 0$.\n    Let's assume $a$ is odd and $b$ is even.\n    $$a^2 = m^2 - k^2$$\n    $$b^2 = 2mk$$\n    $$c = m^2 + k^2$$\n\n4.  **Form a Second Pythagorean Triple**: The equation $a^2 = m^2 - k^2$ can be rewritten as $a^2 + k^2 = m^2$. Since $\\gcd(m, k) = 1$, $(a, k, m)$ is another primitive Pythagorean triple. As $a$ is odd, $k$ must be even and $m$ must be odd.\n\n5.  **Parametrize the Second Triple**: We parametrize $(a, k, m)$ using another pair of coprime integers $p$ and $q$ of opposite parity, with $p > q > 0$.\n    $$a = p^2 - q^2$$\n    $$k = 2pq$$\n    $$m = p^2 + q^2$$\n\n6.  **The Descent Step**: Substitute these expressions for $m$ and $k$ into the equation for $b^2$:\n    $$b^2 = 2mk = 2(p^2 + q^2)(2pq) = 4pq(p^2 + q^2)$$\n    Dividing by $4$, we get:\n    $$(\\frac{b}{2})^2 = pq(p^2 + q^2)$$\n    The integers $p$, $q$, and $p^2+q^2$ are pairwise coprime. Since their product is a perfect square, each of them must be a perfect square.\n    Let $p = u^2$, $q = v^2$, and $p^2 + q^2 = w^2$ for some positive integers $u$, $v$, and $w$.\n\n7.  **Find the New, Smaller Solution**: Substituting $p=u^2$ and $q=v^2$ into the third equation, $p^2+q^2=w^2$, gives:\n    $$(u^2)^2 + (v^2)^2 = w^2 \\implies u^4 + v^4 = w^2$$\n    This equation is of the same form as our starting equation, $a^4 + b^4 = c^2$. We have found a new solution $(u, v, w)$.\n\n8.  **Show the Descent**: To complete the proof, we must show that this new solution is \"smaller\" than the original one in terms of some positive integer measure. The natural candidate is the hypotenuse term. The original hypotenuse was $c$. The new one is $w$. Let's compare their sizes.\n    We have $c = m^2 + k^2$. We also know $m = p^2 + q^2$ and from the previous step, $p^2+q^2 = w^2$. So, $m = w^2$.\n    Since $k = 2pq = 2u^2v^2$ and $u,v$ are positive integers, $k$ is a positive integer, so $k \\geq 1$.\n    Therefore, $c = (w^2)^2 + k^2 = w^4 + k^2$.\n    Since $k^2 \\geq 1$, we have $c > w^4$. Because $u,v \\geq 1$, $w^2 = u^4+v^4 \\geq 1^4+1^4=2$, which implies $w > 1$. Thus, $w^4 > w$.\n    Combining these, we get $c > w^4 > w$. So, $c > w$.\n\nThis establishes a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers $c > w > \\dots$. By the well-ordering principle, such an infinite sequence cannot exist. Thus, our initial assumption that a solution exists must be false.\n\nNow, we apply this to the problem's equation: $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$. We can write this as $(x^2)^2 + (y^2)^2 = (z^2)^2$. This is a Pythagorean triple $(X, Y, Z)$ where $X=x^2$, $Y=y^2$, and $Z=z^2$. The \"hypotenuse\" of this triple is $Z=z^2$.\nIf we assume a solution $(x,y,z)$ to $x^4+y^4=z^4$ exists, then we have a solution $(x, y, z^2)$ to the equation $a^4+b^4=c^2$. The descent argument shows that we can construct a new solution $(u,v,w)$ where $w < z^2$. The quantity that is descending is the \"c\" term, which for our initial equation is $Z=z^2$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The measure is $x + y$, because the sum of the two bases of the associated right triangle derived from $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$ strictly decreases under descent, and any strictly decreasing sequence of such sums must terminate.**\nThe descent step produces a new solution $(u,v,w)$ from an old one $(x,y,c)$. The new bases are $u$ and $v$. The old bases are $x$ and $y$. We have relationships like $x=p^2-q^2=u^4-v^4$ and $y^2 = 2mk \\implies y=2uvw$. It is not obvious, nor is it the standard argument, that $u+v < x+y$. The core of the proof rests on the decrease of the hypotenuse term $c$, not the sum of the bases.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The measure is the hypotenuse $Z = z^2$ of the associated Pythagorean triple obtained by setting $X = x^2$, $Y = y^2$, and $Z = z^2$, and it is well-founded since a strictly decreasing sequence in the positive integers cannot be infinite.**\nThis aligns perfectly with our derivation. The equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$ is equivalent to $(x^2)^2 + (y^2)^2 = (z^2)^2$, defining a Pythagorean triple $(x^2, y^2, z^2)$. The hypotenuse is $Z=z^2$. The method of infinite descent, when applied to a solution $(x,y,z^2)$ of the form $a^4+b^4=c^2$, produces a new solution $(u,v,w)$ where the new hypotenuse $w$ is strictly smaller than the original, $w < z^2$. Since $z^2$ is a positive integer for any non-trivial solution, this creates a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers, which cannot continue indefinitely. This is the precise logic of the proof.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The measure is the greatest common divisor $\\gcd(x,y,z)$ (greatest common divisor), because under descent the common divisors of $x$, $y$, and $z$ strictly decrease and eventually reach $1$.**\nThis is incorrect. The proof begins by assuming a *primitive* solution, i.e., one where $\\gcd(x,y,z)=1$. If a non-primitive solution exists, it can be reduced to a primitive one by dividing out the common factors. The descent procedure then generates a new, smaller solution that is also shown to be primitive. Therefore, the gcd remains constant at $1$ throughout the descent steps; it does not decrease.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The measure is the ratio $x / y$, because by the Archimedean property of the real numbers the sequence of ratios must eventually terminate when it decreases strictly at each step.**\nThere are two major flaws here. First, the well-ordering principle, which is the foundation of infinite descent, applies to sets of positive integers, not rational numbers. A strictly decreasing sequence of positive rational numbers (e.g., $1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots$) can be infinite. The reference to the Archimedean property is irrelevant and misapplied. Second, there is no guarantee that the ratio $x/y$ decreases at each step of the descent. In fact, a simple analysis shows it's not guaranteed to decrease. This is not a well-founded measure for descent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3085275"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of primitivity and identified the quantity that must decrease, the final task is to connect these ideas by executing the full logical chain of the proof.

Writing $d-c=2e^2$ and $d+c=2f^2$ with $\\gcd(e,f)=1$ and $s=ef$, we obtain $d=e^2+f^2$ and $c=f^2-e^2$, and then\n$$r^2=d^2-2s^2=(e^2+f^2)^2-2(e f)^2=e^4+f^4.$$\nTherefore, setting $x'=e$, $y'=f$, $z'=r$, we have $x'^4+y'^4=z'^2$ and moreover\n$$z'=r<z=m^2+n^2=r^4+4s^4,$$\ncontradicting the minimality of $z$ and completing the infinite descent.\n\nB. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with $\\gcd(x,y)=1$ and minimal $z$. Parametrize $(x^2,y^2,z)$ by $x^2=m^2-n^2$, $y^2=2mn$, $z=m^2+n^2$ with coprime $m,n$ of opposite parity. Since $2mn$ is a square and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, take $m=p^2$, $n=q^2$. Then $y^2=2p^2q^2$ is a square, and factoring $x^2=p^4-q^4=(p^2-q^2)(p^2+q^2)$ yields $(p^2-q^2)=u^2$, $(p^2+q^2)=v^2$. Define $x'=uv$, $y'=2pq$, $z'=p^2+q^2$ to obtain $x'^4+y'^4=z'^2$ with $z'<z$, achieving descent.\n\nC. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with minimal $z$. Since $x^2+y^2=z$, parametrize $(x,y,z)$ as a primitive Pythagorean triple:\n$$x=m^2-n^2,\\quad y=2mn,\\quad z=m^2+n^2,$$\nwith $m,n$ coprime of opposite parity. Because $x^4+y^4=(x^2+y^2)^2-2x^2y^2=z^2$, conclude immediately that both $x^2$ and $y^2$ are squares of the form $a^2$ and $b^2$, so $x=a$, $y=b$, and hence $z$ can be replaced by $m^2+n^2$ to construct a smaller solution, contradicting minimality.\n\nD. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with minimal $z$ and $\\gcd(x,y)=1$. Parametrize $(x^2,y^2,z)$ as $x^2=m^2-n^2$, $y^2=2mn$, $z=m^2+n^2$ with coprime $m,n$ of opposite parity. Take $m=2r^2$, $n=s^2$ so $y^2=4r^2 s^2$ is a square. Then\n$$x^2=4r^4-s^4=(2r^2-s^2)(2r^2+s^2),$$\nand hence both factors are squares, $2r^2-s^2=c^2$ and $2r^2+s^2=d^2$, which implies $r^2=c^2+d^2$. Write $r=e^2+f^2$, so $r^2=e^4+2e^2f^2+f^4$. Let $x'=e^2$, $y'=f^2$, $z'=r$ to get $x'^4+y'^4=z'^2$ and $z'<z$.\n\nE. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with minimal $z$ but without any coprimeness or parity restrictions. Factor\n$$(x^2+y^2-z)(x^2+y^2+z)=2x^2y^2,$$\nand conclude both factors are equal perfect squares, say $x^2+y^2-z=u^2$ and $x^2+y^2+z=v^2$, so $z=v^2-u^2$. Then replace $(x,y,z)$ by $(u,v,z')$ with $z'=v-u$ to obtain $u^4+v^4=(v-u)^2$ and repeat to descend.\n\nSelect the correct option.

I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Descent\n\nThe goal is to show that the equation $x^4+y^4=z^2$ has no solution in positive integers.\n\n1.  **Assumption and Minimality**: Assume a solution $(x,y,z)$ in positive integers exists. By the well-ordering principle, there must be a solution for which $z$ is minimal.\n\n2.  **Primitive Solution**: Let $d = \\gcd(x,y)$. Then $d^4 | x^4$ and $d^4 | y^4$, so $d^4 | (x^4+y^4) = z^2$. This implies that $d^2 | z$. We can define a new, smaller solution $(x/d, y/d, z/d^2)$. If $d>1$, then $z/d^2 < z$, contradicting the minimality of $z$. Thus, for the minimal solution, we must have $\\gcd(x,y)=1$.\n\n3.  **First Pythagorean Parametrization**: The equation can be written as $(x^2)^2 + (y^2)^2 = z^2$. Since $\\gcd(x,y)=1$, we have $\\gcd(x^2,y^2)=1$. Thus, $(x^2, y^2, z)$ is a primitive Pythagorean triple (PPT). Without loss of generality, let $x$ be odd and $y$ be even. This forces the assignment from the PPT parametrization:\n    $$x^2 = m^2 - n^2$$\n    $$y^2 = 2mn$$\n    $$z = m^2 + n^2$$\n    where $m, n$ are coprime integers with $m>n>0$ and of opposite parity.\n\n4.  **Parity Constraint on $m, n$**: Since $x$ is odd, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. From $x^2=m^2-n^2$, if $m$ were even and $n$ odd, then $m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ and $n^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, which would give $x^2 \\equiv 0-1 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. This is impossible for an integer square. Therefore, $m$ must be odd and $n$ must be even.\n\n5.  **Analysis of $y^2 = 2mn$**: Since $m$ is odd, $n$ is even, and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, we have $\\gcd(m, 2n) = \\gcd(m,2)\\gcd(m,n) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. The equation $y^2 = m(2n)$ where the factors $m$ and $2n$ are coprime implies that both factors must be perfect squares.\n    $$m = r^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2n = k^2$$\n    For $k^2$ to be twice an integer, $k$ must be even, so $k=2s$. Then $k^2 = 4s^2$, which gives $2n = 4s^2$, simplifying to $n=2s^2$. Thus, we have uniquely determined:\n    $$m = r^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = 2s^2$$\n    for some positive integers $r, s$. Since $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, it follows that $\\gcd(r,s)=1$ and $r$ must be odd.\n\n6.  **Second Pythagorean Parametrization**: Substitute these forms for $m$ and $n$ back into the equation for $x^2$:\n    $$x^2 = m^2-n^2 = (r^2)^2 - (2s^2)^2 = r^4 - 4s^4$$\n    Rearranging gives $x^2 + (2s^2)^2 = (r^2)^2$. This is another Pythagorean triple, $(x, 2s^2, r^2)$.\n    Let's check if it's primitive. A common divisor of $x$ and $2s^2$ must be odd (since $x$ is odd). If a prime $p$ divides $x$ and $s$, then from $r^4 = x^2+4s^4$, $p$ must divide $r^4$, so $p|r$. This contradicts $\\gcd(r,s)=1$. Therefore, $\\gcd(x, 2s^2)=1$, and $(x, 2s^2, r^2)$ is a PPT.\n    We can parametrize this new PPT. Since $x$ is odd, we have:\n    $$x = p^2 - q^2$$\n    $$2s^2 = 2pq$$\n    $$r^2 = p^2 + q^2$$\n    for some coprime integers $p>q>0$ of opposite parity.\n\n7.  **The Descent**: From $s^2=pq$ and $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, it follows that both $p$ and $q$ must be perfect squares. Let:\n    $$p=e^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q=f^2$$\n    Substituting these into the equation for $r^2$ gives:\n    $$r^2 = (e^2)^2 + (f^2)^2 = e^4 + f^4$$\n    This means we have found a new solution $(x',y',z') = (e,f,r)$ to the original equation $x'^4+y'^4=z'^2$.\n\n8.  **Contradiction**: We must show this new solution is strictly smaller. The new $z$-value is $z' = r$. The original $z$-value was $z = m^2+n^2 = (r^2)^2+(2s^2)^2 = r^4+4s^4$. Since $y>0$, we have $s \\ge 1$. Also, $r^2=p^2+q^2=e^4+f^4 \\ge 1^4+1^4=2$ (since $p>q>0$, we have $e>f\\ge 1$), which means $r>1$. Therefore:\n    $$z' = r < r^4 \\le r^4+4s^4 = z$$\n    We have constructed a new integer solution $(e,f,r)$ with a third component $r$ that is strictly smaller than the third component $z$ of the minimal solution. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption that any solution exists must be false.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Assume $(x,y,z)$ is a solution to $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with $\\gcd(x,y)=1$, and choose it so that $z$ is minimal. Then $(x^2,y^2,z)$ is a primitive Pythagorean triple, so there exist coprime $m>n$ of opposite parity with $x^2=m^2-n^2,\\quad y^2=2mn,\\quad z=m^2+n^2.$ Since $\\gcd(m,n)=1$ and $y^2=2mn$ is a square, it follows that (up to relabeling consistent with parity) $m=r^2$ and $n=2s^2$ with $\\gcd(r,s)=1$. Thus $x^2=m^2-n^2=r^4-4s^4=(r^2-2s^2)(r^2+2s^2),$ and one checks $\\gcd(r^2-2s^2,r^2+2s^2)=1$, so both factors are themselves perfect squares: $r^2-2s^2=c^2,\\quad r^2+2s^2=d^2,$ with $d>c$ and $d^2-c^2=4s^2$. Writing $d-c=2e^2$ and $d+c=2f^2$ with $\\gcd(e,f)=1$ and $s=ef$, we obtain $d=e^2+f^2$ and $c=f^2-e^2$, and then $r^2=d^2-2s^2=(e^2+f^2)^2-2(e f)^2=e^4+f^4.$ Therefore, setting $x'=e^2$, $y'=f^2$, $z'=r$, we have $x'^4+y'^4=z'^2$ and moreover $z'=r<z=m^2+n^2=r^4+4s^4,$ contradicting the minimality of $z$ and completing the infinite descent.**\n\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n-   **Justification**: This option presents a logically sound chain of deductions that correctly leads to the infinite descent contradiction. It correctly identifies the first PPT and the decomposition of $m,n$. The subsequent steps, while following a slightly less direct path than the standard proof (by introducing $c$ and $d$ instead of immediately forming a new PPT), are all mathematically valid. The logic $r^2-2s^2=c^2, r^2+2s^2=d^2 \\implies 2r^2=c^2+d^2$ and then solving for $c,d$ from $d^2-c^2=4s^2$ is a valid method that correctly yields $e^4+f^4=r^2$. The inequality demonstrating descent $z'<z$ is correct.\n-   Minor flaws exist: The justification for $m=r^2, n=2s^2$ as \"up to relabeling\" is imprecise (the choice is forced by parity, as shown above). Also, the final variable assignment $x'=e^2, y'=f^2$ for the new solution is a typo; it should be $x'=e, y'=f$. However, these blemishes do not invalidate the core mathematical sequence, which is what the question asks for. Compared to the other options, it is the only one containing a valid proof.\n\n**B. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with $\\gcd(x,y)=1$ and minimal $z$. Parametrize $(x^2,y^2,z)$ by $x^2=m^2-n^2$, $y^2=2mn$, $z=m^2+n^2$ with coprime $m,n$ of opposite parity. Since $2mn$ is a square and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, take $m=p^2$, $n=q^2$. ...**\n\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n-   **Justification**: The step \"take $m=p^2, n=q^2$\" is a fatal error. If this were true, $y^2 = 2mn = 2p^2q^2 = 2(pq)^2$. For this to be a perfect square, $2$ would have to be a perfect square, which is false.\n\n**C. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with minimal $z$. Since $x^2+y^2=z$, parametrize $(x,y,z)$ as a primitive Pythagorean triple: ...**\n\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n-   **Justification**: This option begins with a false premise. The equation is $x^4+y^4=z^2$, which is $(x^2)^2+(y^2)^2=z^2$. It is not $x^2+y^2=z$. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.\n\n**D. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with minimal $z$ and $\\gcd(x,y)=1$. Parametrize $(x^2,y^2,z)$ as $x^2=m^2-n^2$, $y^2=2mn$, $z=m^2+n^2$ with coprime $m,n$ of opposite parity. Take $m=2r^2$, $n=s^2$ so $y^2=4r^2 s^2$ is a square. ...**\n\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n-   **Justification**: The choice $m=2r^2$ (even) and $n=s^2$ (odd) is arithmetically impossible. As derived above, the equation $x^2=m^2-n^2$ requires $m$ to be odd and $n$ to be even, otherwise $x^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This option makes the wrong choice, so its entire line of reasoning is invalid from this step.\n\n**E. Assume $(x,y,z)$ solves $x^4+y^4=z^2$ with minimal $z$ but without any coprimeness or parity restrictions. Factor $(x^2+y^2-z)(x^2+y^2+z)=2x^2y^2,$ and conclude both factors are equal perfect squares, ...**\n\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n-   **Justification**: The factorization is correct, but the conclusion that \"both factors are equal perfect squares\" is completely unfounded. There is no mathematical basis to claim these factors are equal (which would imply $z=0$) or that they are perfect squares without establishing their coprimality, which is not done.
