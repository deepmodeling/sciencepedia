The task is to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm and then to find a particular solution to the associated linear Diophantine equation (Bézout's identity) using the extended Euclidean algorithm via back-substitution.\n\nLet the integers be $a = 899$ and $b = 493$. We are tasked with finding $d = \\gcd(a, b)$ and a pair of integers $(u, v)$ such that $au + bv = d$.\n\nFirst, we apply the Euclidean algorithm, which relies on the property that $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, r)$, where $r$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. We repeatedly apply the division algorithm, $a = bq + r$, until we obtain a remainder of $0$. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nThe sequence of divisions is as follows:\n$$899 = 1 \\cdot 493 + 406$$\n$$493 = 1 \\cdot 406 + 87$$\n$$406 = 4 \\cdot 87 + 58$$\n$$87 = 1 \\cdot 58 + 29$$\n$$58 = 2 \\cdot 29 + 0$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $29$. Therefore, $d = \\gcd(899, 493) = 29$.\n\nNext, to find the integers $u$ and $v$ satisfying $899u + 493v = 29$, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm by performing back-substitution on the equations generated above. We start with the equation which yielded the GCD as its remainder and express the GCD as a linear combination of the dividend and divisor from that step.\n\nFrom the second to last equation, we have:\n$$29 = 87 - 1 \\cdot 58$$\nOur goal is to express $29$ solely in terms of the original numbers, $899$ and $493$. We proceed by substituting the remainders from the previous steps, working our way back up the list of equations.\n\nFrom the equation $406 = 4 \\cdot 87 + 58$, we can express the remainder $58$ as:\n$$58 = 406 - 4 \\cdot 87$$\nSubstituting this expression for $58$ into our equation for $29$:\n$$29 = 87 - 1 \\cdot (406 - 4 \\cdot 87)$$\n$$29 = 87 - 406 + 4 \\cdot 87$$\n$$29 = (1+4) \\cdot 87 - 1 \\cdot 406$$\n$$29 = 5 \\cdot 87 - 1 \\cdot 406$$\n\nNext, we use the equation $493 = 1 \\cdot 406 + 87$ to express the remainder $87$ as:\n$$87 = 493 - 1 \\cdot 406$$\nSubstituting this into our current expression for $29$:\n$$29 = 5 \\cdot (493 - 1 \\cdot 406) - 1 \\cdot 406$$\n$$29 = 5 \\cdot 493 - 5 \\cdot 406 - 1 \\cdot 406$$\n$$29 = 5 \\cdot 493 - (5+1) \\cdot 406$$\n$$29 = 5 \\cdot 493 - 6 \\cdot 406$$\n\nFinally, we use the first equation, $899 = 1 \\cdot 493 + 406$, to express the remainder $406$ as:\n$$406 = 899 - 1 \\cdot 493$$\nSubstituting this final expression into our equation for $29$:\n$$29 = 5 \\cdot 493 - 6 \\cdot (899 - 1 \\cdot 493)$$\n$$29 = 5 \\cdot 493 - 6 \\cdot 899 + 6 \\cdot 493$$\n$$29 = (5+6) \\cdot 493 - 6 \\cdot 899$$\n$$29 = 11 \\cdot 493 - 6 \\cdot 899$$\n\nRearranging this to match the form $899u + 493v = 29$, we get:\n$$899(-6) + 493(11) = 29$$\nBy comparing this to the target equation $899u + 493v = 29$, we can identify the coefficients:\n$u = -6$\n$v = 11$\n\nThus, we have found the greatest common divisor $d = 29$ and a pair of integers $(u, v) = (-6, 11)$ that satisfy the required condition.

The equation is of the form $ax+by=c$, with integer coefficients $a=35$, $b=21$, and $c=14$. According to Bézout's identity, such an equation has integer solutions for $x$ and $y$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\text{gcd}(a,b)$, divides $c$. We compute the greatest common divisor of $35$ and $21$. The prime factorization of $35$ is $5 \\times 7$, and the prime factorization of $21$ is $3 \\times 7$. Thus, $\\text{gcd}(35, 21) = 7$. Since $7$ divides $14$ (specifically, $14 = 2 \\times 7$), integer solutions exist. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in number theory.\n\nThe first task is to reduce the equation. We divide the entire equation by $d = \\text{gcd}(35, 21) = 7$:\n$$ \\frac{35}{7}x + \\frac{21}{7}y = \\frac{14}{7} $$\n$$ 5x + 3y = 2 $$\nThis reduced equation is equivalent to the original one. Any integer pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies $35x+21y=14$ must also satisfy $5x+3y=2$ after division by $7$. Conversely, any integer pair $(x,y)$ satisfying $5x+3y=2$ will also satisfy the original equation when multiplied by $7$. Therefore, the solution sets are identical. The new coefficients for $x$ and $y$ are $a' = 5$ and $b' = 3$, which are coprime since $\\text{gcd}(5, 3) = 1$.\n\nThe second task is to find the homogeneous solution set for $35x+21y=0$. This is equivalent to solving the reduced homogeneous equation $5x+3y=0$. We can rearrange this as $5x = -3y$. Since $5$ and $3$ are coprime, for this equality to hold true for integers $x$ and $y$, $x$ must be a multiple of $3$, and $y$ must be a multiple of $5$. We can express this parametrically. Let $x = 3k$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Substituting this into the equation gives $5(3k) = -3y$, which simplifies to $15k = -3y$, or $y = -5k$. Thus, the set of all homogeneous solutions $(x_h, y_h)$ is given by:\n$$ (x_h, y_h) = (3k, -5k) \\quad \\text{for any integer } k \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\nThe third task is to find the complete inhomogeneous solution set. The general solution $(x,y)$ to an inhomogeneous linear Diophantine equation is the sum of a particular solution $(x_p, y_p)$ and the general homogeneous solution $(x_h, y_h)$. We need to find one particular solution to $5x+3y=2$. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers $u$ and $v$ such that $5u+3v = \\text{gcd}(5,3) = 1$.\n$$ 5 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 $$\n$$ 3 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 $$\nWorking backwards to express $1$ as a linear combination of $5$ and $3$:\n$$ 1 = 3 - 1 \\cdot 2 $$\nFrom the first line, we have $2 = 5 - 1 \\cdot 3$. Substituting this into the expression for $1$:\n$$ 1 = 3 - 1 \\cdot (5 - 1 \\cdot 3) = 3 - 5 + 3 = 2 \\cdot 3 + (-1) \\cdot 5 $$\nSo, we have the identity $5(-1) + 3(2) = 1$. To find a particular solution for $5x+3y=2$, we multiply this entire identity by $2$:\n$$ 2 \\cdot [5(-1) + 3(2)] = 2 \\cdot 1 $$\n$$ 5(-2) + 3(4) = 2 $$\nThis gives us a particular solution $(x_p, y_p) = (-2, 4)$.\nThe general solution $(x,y)$ is the sum of the particular solution and the homogeneous solutions:\n$$ (x(k), y(k)) = (x_p, y_p) + (x_h, y_h) = (-2, 4) + (3k, -5k) $$\nThis provides the parametric form for all integer solutions:\n$$ x(k) = -2 + 3k $$\n$$ y(k) = 4 - 5k $$\nfor any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe final task is to find the minimal possible value of $|x|+|y|$ among all these integer solutions. We need to minimize the function $f(k) = |x(k)| + |y(k)| = |-2+3k| + |4-5k|$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe function $f(k)$ is a sum of absolute values, which is a convex function. For a real variable $k$, its minimum would occur where one of the arguments of the absolute value functions is zero. These points are:\n$ -2+3k = 0 \\implies k = 2/3 $\n$ 4-5k = 0 \\implies k = 4/5 $\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the minimum of $f(k)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ will be found at an integer value of $k$ close to the interval $[2/3, 4/5]$. The integers immediately surrounding this interval are $k=0$ and $k=1$. We evaluate $f(k)$ at these integer values and nearby points to find the minimum.\nFor $k=-1$:\n$ x(-1) = -2+3(-1) = -5 $, $ y(-1) = 4-5(-1) = 9 $.\n$ f(-1) = |-5| + |9| = 5+9=14 $.\nFor $k=0$:\n$ x(0) = -2+3(0) = -2 $, $ y(0) = 4-5(0) = 4 $.\n$ f(0) = |-2| + |4| = 2+4=6 $.\nFor $k=1$:\n$ x(1) = -2+3(1) = 1 $, $ y(1) = 4-5(1) = -1 $.\n$ f(1) = |1| + |-1| = 1+1=2 $.\nFor $k=2$:\n$ x(2) = -2+3(2) = 4 $, $ y(2) = 4-5(2) = -6 $.\n$ f(2) = |4| + |-6| = 4+6=10 $.\nThe values of $f(k)$ are increasing as $k$ moves away from the interval $[2/3, 4/5]$. Comparing the calculated values, the minimum value is $2$, which occurs at $k=1$. The corresponding solution is $(x,y)=(1,-1)$. A check confirms this is a valid solution: $35(1) + 21(-1) = 35 - 21 = 14$. The value of $|x|+|y|$ for this solution is $|1|+|-1|=2$.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible value of $|x|+|y|$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3086996"}, {"introduction": "Often in mathematics and its applications, a problem is defined by more than one constraint.
