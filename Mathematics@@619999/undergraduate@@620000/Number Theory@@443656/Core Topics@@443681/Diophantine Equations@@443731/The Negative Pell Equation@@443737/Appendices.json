A full derivation and evaluation of the options will be performed.\n\n### Derivation\nThe given equation is $x^2 - D y^2 = -1$. We are instructed to analyze this equation using congruences modulo $4$.\nThe equation can be written as a congruence:\n$$x^2 - D y^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$$\nSince $-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the congruence is:\n$$x^2 - D y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\n\nThe problem states, and it is a basic fact, that the square of any integer $n$ is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$.\n-   If $n$ is even, $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $n$ is odd, $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then $n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nSo, for any integer solution $(x, y)$, we must have $x^2 \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\pmod{4}$ and $y^2 \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\pmod{4}$.\n\nWe analyze the four possible cases for the residue of $D$ modulo $4$.\n\n**Case 1: $D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes $x^2 - (0) y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, which simplifies to:\n$$x^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nThis is impossible, as an integer square can only be congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$. Therefore, for $D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, the equation $x^2 - D y^2 = -1$ has no integer solutions.\n\n**Case 2: $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes:\n$$x^2 - y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nWe examine the possibilities for $x^2 \\pmod{4}$ and $y^2 \\pmod{4}$:\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $0 - 0 = 0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $0 - 1 = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.

This implies that $x$ must be even and $y$ must be odd. Therefore, if a solution exists for $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, it must have this parity.\n\n**Case 3: $D \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes:\n$$x^2 - 2y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nWe examine the possibilities:\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $0 - 2(0) = 0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $0 - 2(1) = -2 \\equiv 2 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $1 - 2(0) = 1 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $1 - 2(1) = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.

Therefore, if a solution exists for $D \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, it must have this parity.\n\n**Case 4: $D \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$**\nThe congruence becomes:\n$$x^2 - 3y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nSince $-3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, this is equivalent to:\n$$x^2 + y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\nWe examine the possibilities for the sum of two squares modulo $4$:\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $0 + 0 = 0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 0$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $0 + 1 = 1 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 0$: $1 + 0 = 1 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n-   If $x^2 \\equiv 1$ and $y^2 \\equiv 1$: $1 + 1 = 2 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nNone of the combinations satisfy the congruence. The sum of two squares modulo $4$ can only result in $0$, $1$, or $2$. It can never be $3$.

The methodology is prescribed: using the simple continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{29}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{29}$.

The Brahmagupta identity gives\n$$\n(a^{2} - D b^{2})(c^{2} - D d^{2}) = (ac + D bd)^{2} - D(ad + bc)^{2}.\n$$\nIf we choose $(c,d,\\ell) = (m,1,m^{2} - D)$ for some integer $m$, then\n$$\n(a^{2} - D b^{2})(m^{2} - D) = (am + D b)^{2} - D(a + bm)^{2}.\n$$\nDividing both sides by $k$ (provided we impose a divisibility condition shortly) suggests defining\n$$\na' = \\frac{am + D b}{|k|}, \\quad b' = \\frac{a + bm}{|k|}, \\quad k' = \\frac{m^{2} - D}{k}.\n$$\nTo ensure that $a'$ and $b'$ are integers, it is sufficient to require the congruence\n$$\na + bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}.\n$$\nUnder this condition, $|k|$ divides $a + bm$, and since $a^{2} - D b^{2} = k$, one checks that $|k|$ also divides $am + D b$:\n$$\nam + D b \\equiv am - a^{2} b^{-1} \\equiv a(m - ab^{-1}) \\equiv a \\cdot 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|},\n$$\nwhere $b^{-1}$ denotes a modular inverse of $b$ modulo $|k|$ when it exists, and in general the congruence $a + bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$ forces the integrality of both numerators because\n$$\n(am + D b) - a(a + bm) = D b - a^{2} \\equiv -k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}.\n$$\nThus the update is well-defined over the integers. The heuristic of the Chakravala method is to choose $m$ satisfying $a + bm \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$ that makes $|m^{2} - D|$ as small as possible, so that $|k'| = \\left|\\frac{m^{2} - D}{k}\\right|$ is reduced toward $1$.\n\nWe now implement this for $D = 29$.\n\nInitialization. Let $a_{0} = \\lceil \\sqrt{29} \\rceil = 6$, $b_{0} = 1$, so that\n$$\nk_{0} = a_{0}^{2} - 29 b_{0}^{2} = 36 - 29 = 7.\n$$\nThus the initial triple is $(a,b,k) = (6,1,7)$.\n\nFirst step. We require $m \\equiv -a \\pmod{|k|}$, i.e., $m \\equiv -6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Among integers congruent to $1 \\pmod{7}$, we choose $m$ minimizing $|m^{2} - 29|$. The candidates $m \\in \\{ \\ldots, -6, 1, 8, 15, \\ldots \\}$ give $|(-6)^{2} - 29| = 7$, $|1^{2} - 29| = 28$, $|8^{2} - 29| = 35$. Taking $m = 1$ yields a valid reduction and keeps $m$ small. Compute\n$$\na' = \\frac{6 \\cdot 1 + 29 \\cdot 1}{7} = \\frac{35}{7} = 5, \\quad b' = \\frac{6 + 1 \\cdot 1}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} = 1, \\quad k' = \\frac{1^{2} - 29}{7} = -4.\n$$\nNew triple: $(a,b,k) = (5,1,-4)$.\n\nSecond step. Impose $m \\equiv -a \\pmod{|k|}$, i.e., $m \\equiv -5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Minimizing $|m^{2} - 29|$ over $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ gives candidates $m \\in \\{ \\ldots, -1, 3, 7, 11, \\ldots \\}$ with values $|(-1)^{2} - 29| = 28$, $|3^{2} - 29| = 20$, $|7^{2} - 29| = 20$. Choose $m = 3$. Then\n$$\na' = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3 + 29 \\cdot 1}{4} = \\frac{44}{4} = 11, \\quad b' = \\frac{5 + 1 \\cdot 3}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2, \\quad k' = \\frac{3^{2} - 29}{-4} = 5.\n$$\nNew triple: $(a,b,k) = (11,2,5)$.\n\nThird step. We need $m$ such that $a + b m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$, i.e., $11 + 2 m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $2 m \\equiv -1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, hence $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. Minimize $|m^{2} - 29|$ over $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. Candidates $m \\in \\{ \\ldots, -3, 2, 7, 12, \\ldots \\}$ give $|(-3)^{2} - 29| = 20$, $|2^{2} - 29| = 25$, $|7^{2} - 29| = 20$. Choose $m = 7$. Then\n$$\na' = \\frac{11 \\cdot 7 + 29 \\cdot 2}{5} = \\frac{77 + 58}{5} = \\frac{135}{5} = 27, \\quad b' = \\frac{11 + 2 \\cdot 7}{5} = \\frac{25}{5} = 5, \\quad k' = \\frac{7^{2} - 29}{5} = 4.\n$$\nNew triple: $(a,b,k) = (27,5,4)$.\n\nFourth step. Impose $m \\equiv -a \\pmod{|k|}$, i.e., $m \\equiv -27 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Minimize $|m^{2} - 29|$ for $m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Candidates $m \\in \\{ \\ldots, 1, 5, 9, \\ldots \\}$ give $|1^{2} - 29| = 28$, $|5^{2} - 29| = 4$, $|9^{2} - 29| = 52$. Choose $m = 5$. Then\n$$\na' = \\frac{27 \\cdot 5 + 29 \\cdot 5}{4} = \\frac{135 + 145}{4} = \\frac{280}{4} = 70, \\quad b' = \\frac{27 + 5 \\cdot 5}{4} = \\frac{27 + 25}{4} = \\frac{52}{4} = 13, \\quad k' = \\frac{5^{2} - 29}{4} = -1.\n$$\nWe have reached $k' = -1$, so $(x,y) = (70,13)$ is a solution to the negative Pell equation\n$$\nx^{2} - 29 y^{2} = -1.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Justification of integrality, descent of $|k|$, and minimality.\n\nIntegrality at each step follows from the congruence $a + b m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{|k|}$ and the relation\n$$\n(am + D b) - a(a + bm) = D b - a^{2} = -k,\n$$\nwhich shows that if $|k|$ divides $a + b m$ then it also divides $am + D b$, hence both $a'$ and $b'$ are integers. The reduction in $|k|$ is enforced by choosing $m$ so that $|m^{2} - D|$ is as small as possible under the divisibility constraint. In the explicit sequence for $D = 29$, the values of $|k|$ pass through $7 \\to 4 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 1$, arriving at $|k| = 1$ in finitely many steps.\n\nTo argue minimality, we appeal to the continued fraction analysis of Step 1. For $\\sqrt{29} = [\\,5;\\overline{2,1,1,2,10}\\,]$ of odd period length $5$, the convergent obtained by truncating at the period length yields the minimal solution to the negative Pell equation. Computing convergents $p_{n}/q_{n}$ via\n$$\np_{-2} = 0, \\quad p_{-1} = 1, \\quad p_{n} = a_{n} p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}, \\quad\nq_{-2} = 1, \\quad q_{-1} = 0, \\quad q_{n} = a_{n} q_{n-1} + q_{n-2},\n$$\nwith $a_{0} = 5$, $a_{1} = 2$, $a_{2} = 1$, $a_{3} = 1$, $a_{4} = 2$, we obtain\n$$\n\\frac{p_{0}}{q_{0}} = \\frac{5}{1}, \\quad \\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}} = \\frac{11}{2}, \\quad \\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}} = \\frac{16}{3}, \\quad \\frac{p_{3}}{q_{3}} = \\frac{27}{5}, \\quad \\frac{p_{4}}{q_{4}} = \\frac{70}{13}.\n$$\nSince the period length is $5$ (odd), the convergent $\\frac{p_{4}}{q_{4}} = \\frac{70}{13}$ satisfies $p_{4}^{2} - 29 q_{4}^{2} = -1$, giving the minimal positive solution $(x,y) = (70,13)$ to $x^{2} - 29 y^{2} = -1$. This matches the terminal Chakravala triple obtained above, confirming both convergence and minimality.\n\nTherefore, the minimal solution to $x^{2} - 29 y^{2} = -1$ is $(x,y) = (70,13)$, and the requested expression is $x + y \\sqrt{29} = 70 + 13 \\sqrt{29}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{70+13\\sqrt{29}}$$", "id": "3092550"}]}
