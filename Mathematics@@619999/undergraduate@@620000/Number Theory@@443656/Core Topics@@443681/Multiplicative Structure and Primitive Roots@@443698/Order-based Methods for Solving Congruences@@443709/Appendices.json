All required data and definitions are provided, and the tasks are unambiguous.\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct but related tasks regarding modular arithmetic with modulus $n=17$ and base $a=3$. We will address each in sequence.\n\nFirst, we determine the multiplicative order of $3$ modulo $17$, denoted as $\\operatorname{ord}_{17}(3)$. The problem states we are to work within the group of units modulo $n$. For $n=17$, which is a prime number, the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/17\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ consists of the nonzero residue classes $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 16\\}$ under multiplication. The order of this group is given by Euler's totient function, $\\left|(\\mathbb{Z}/17\\mathbb{Z})^\\times\\right|=\\varphi(17)$. Since $17$ is prime, $\\varphi(17) = 17 - 1 = 16$.\nThe definition of $\\operatorname{ord}_{n}(a)$ requires that $\\gcd(a,n)=1$. For $a=3$ and $n=17$, we have $\\gcd(3,17)=1$, as required.\nA foundational principle of group theory (Lagrange's Theorem) states that the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Therefore, $\\operatorname{ord}_{17}(3)$ must be a divisor of $16$. The positive divisors of $16$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, and $16$. To find the order, which is the *least* such positive integer, we test these divisors in increasing order.\nAll congruences are modulo $17$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For the exponent $t=1$: $3^1 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$.\n    \\item For the exponent $t=2$: $3^2 = 9 \\equiv 9 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$.\n    \\item For the exponent $t=4$: $3^4 = (3^2)^2 \\equiv 9^2 = 81$. Since $81 = 4 \\times 17 + 13$, we have $3^4 \\equiv 13 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$.\n    \\item For the exponent $t=8$: $3^8 = (3^4)^2 \\equiv 13^2 = 169$. Since $169 = 9 \\times 17 + 16$, we have $3^8 \\equiv 16 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$. This is not $1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSince the order is not $1$, $2$, $4$, or $8$, it must be $16$. We can verify this: $3^{16} = (3^8)^2 \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$. This is also a direct consequence of Fermat's Little Theorem.\nThus, the multiplicative order of $3$ modulo $17$ is $\\operatorname{ord}_{17}(3) = 16$.\n\nSecond, we use this order to compute the residue of $3^{2023}$ modulo $17$. The property of order allows us to reduce the exponent modulo the order. Specifically, if $t = \\operatorname{ord}_{n}(a)$, then $a^k \\equiv a^{k \\pmod t} \\pmod n$.\nWe need to find the remainder of $2023$ when divided by the order, $16$.\n$$2023 = 16 \\times 126 + 7$$\nThis implies that $2023 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{16}$.\nTherefore, we can simplify the original computation:\n$$3^{2023} \\equiv 3^{16 \\times 126 + 7} \\equiv (3^{16})^{126} \\cdot 3^7 \\pmod{17}$$\nSince $3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$, this simplifies to:\n$$1^{126} \\cdot 3^7 \\equiv 3^7 \\pmod{17}$$\nNow we compute $3^7 \\pmod{17}$. We can use the intermediate powers calculated previously: $3^1 \\equiv 3$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, and $3^4 \\equiv 13$.\n$$3^7 = 3^{4+2+1} = 3^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 3^1$$\n$$3^7 \\equiv 13 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{17}$$\nFirst, we compute $13 \\cdot 9 = 117$. Dividing by $17$, $117 = 6 \\times 17 + 15$, so $117 \\equiv 15 \\pmod{17}$.\nNext, we compute $15 \\cdot 3 = 45$. Dividing by $17$, $45 = 2 \\times 17 + 11$, so $45 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{17}$.\nThus, $3^{2023} \\equiv 11 \\pmod{17}$. The requested residue class representative is $11$.\n\nThird, we contrast the number of modular multiplications for the two approaches. A modular squaring is counted as one modular multiplication.\n\nApproach 1: Order-based reduction.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Find the order $\\operatorname{ord}_{17}(3)$. This involved computing $3^2$, $3^4$, and $3^8$.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item $3^2 = 3 \\cdot 3$: $1$ multiplication (a squaring).\n        \\item $3^4 = (3^2)^2$: $1$ squaring.\n        \\item $3^8 = (3^4)^2$: $1$ squaring.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    This step requires a total of $3$ modular multiplications.\n    \\item Compute $3^7 \\pmod{17}$. We reuse the powers $3^1, 3^2, 3^4$ which were computed.\n    $3^7 = 3^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 3^1$.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Let $P = 3^4 \\cdot 3^2$: $1$ multiplication.\n        \\item Result $= P \\cdot 3^1$: $1$ multiplication.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    This step requires $2$ additional modular multiplications.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe total number of modular multiplications for the order-based approach is $3 + 2 = 5$.\n\nApproach 2: Straightforward binary exponentiation (left-to-right repeated squaring).\nWe compute $3^{2023} \\pmod{17}$ directly.\nThe exponent is $2023$. Its binary representation is found:\n$2023 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0$.\nSo, $2023_{10} = 11111100111_2$.\nThe binary representation has a length of $11$ bits (from bit $0$ to bit $10$). The number of squarings required by the algorithm is the highest bit position, which is $10$.\nThe number of multiplications is the number of set bits (ones) in the binary string, minus one for the leading bit. The number of ones (Hamming weight) is $9$. So, the number of multiplications is $9-1=8$.\nThe total number of operations is the sum of squarings and multiplications.\nTotal modular multiplications = $10$ (squarings) $+ 8$ (multiplications) $= 18$.\nThe comparison shows a significant efficiency gain for the order-based method ($5$ multiplications) over straightforward binary exponentiation ($18$ multiplications) for this specific problem.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the residue of $3^{2023} \\pmod{17}$, which is $11$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{11}\n$$", "id": "3087787"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of an element's order, a natural question arises: how does the order of an element $a$ relate to the order of its powers, such as $a^k$?

A solution will be provided.\n\nLet $o = \\operatorname{ord}_{37}(a)$ and $m = \\operatorname{ord}_{37}(a^{9})$. We are given $o=36$. We are tasked with finding the value of $m$.\n\nAs per the explicit instructions, we first derive the general relation between the order of an element $a$ and the order of a power of that element, $a^k$, from first principles. Let the modulus be a general integer $N>1$, though in our case $N=37$. Let $o = \\operatorname{ord}_{N}(a)$ and let $m' = \\operatorname{ord}_{N}(a^k)$ for some integer $k$.\n\nBy the definition of order, $m'$ is the least positive integer such that $(a^k)^{m'} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$. This is equivalent to the congruence $a^{km'} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$.\n\nWe are to use the property that if $a^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$, then $\\operatorname{ord}_{N}(a)$ must divide $n$. Applying this to the congruence $a^{km'} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$, we deduce that $o$ must divide the exponent $km'$.\nSo, we have the condition $o | km'$.\n\nLet $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $o$, denoted $d = \\gcd(k,o)$. The definition of GCD allows us to write $k = k'd$ and $o = o'd$ for some integers $k'$ and $o'$ such that $\\gcd(k', o') = 1$. The role of the GCD is to factor out the common part of $k$ and $o$, leaving two coprime integers $k'$ and $o'$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into our divisibility condition $o | km'$, we get:\n$o'd | (k'd)m'$\n\nSince $d = \\gcd(k,o)$ is a positive integer, we can divide both sides of the divisibility relation by $d$:\n$o' | k'm'$\n\nBy Euclid's lemma, since $\\gcd(k', o') = 1$, it must be that $o'$ divides $m'$. This implies that $m'$ must be a multiple of $o'$. Since $m'$ is defined as the *least positive* integer satisfying its congruence, it must be the smallest positive multiple of $o'$. Let us test if $m' = o'$ is a valid solution.\n\nWe must check if $(a^k)^{o'} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$.\n$(a^k)^{o'} = a^{ko'} = a^{(k'd)o'} = a^{k'(do')} = a^{k'o}$\n\nSince $o = \\operatorname{ord}_{N}(a)$, we have $a^o \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$. Therefore:\n$a^{k'o} = (a^o)^{k'} \\equiv 1^{k'} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$\n\nThe condition is satisfied for $m' = o'$. Since we established that any valid $m'$ must be a multiple of $o'$, the least positive value for $m'$ must be $o'$ itself.\nThus, we have derived the general relation:\n$m' = o' = \\frac{o}{d} = \\frac{\\operatorname{ord}_{N}(a)}{\\gcd(k, \\operatorname{ord}_{N}(a))}$\n\nNow, we apply this derived formula to the specific problem given.\nWe have $a \\in \\left(\\mathbb{Z}/37\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$, so the modulus is $N=37$.\nWe are given $\\operatorname{ord}_{37}(a) = 36$.\nWe want to find $\\operatorname{ord}_{37}(a^9)$.

Thus, $9$ is a divisor of $36$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is $9$:\n$\\gcd(9, 36) = 9$\n\nSubstituting this value back into the expression:\n$\\operatorname{ord}_{37}(a^9) = \\frac{36}{9} = 4$\n\nThe order of $a^9$ modulo $37$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3087796"}, {"introduction": "The most elegant order-based techniques, such as the use of discrete logarithms to solve polynomial congruences, depend on the multiplicative group of units being cyclic.
