The fact that for a prime $p$, the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, is a cyclic group of order $p-1$ is a fundamental theorem (the Primitive Root Theorem). The statement that the order of an element divides the order of the group is a direct consequence of Lagrange's theorem.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the least positive integer $k$ such that $2^{k}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. By definition, this integer $k$ is the order of the element $2$ in the multiplicative group of integers modulo $47$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/47\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.\n\nThe group $(\\mathbb{Z}/47\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ consists of the integers from $1$ to $46$ under multiplication modulo $47$. The order of this group is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(47)$. Since $47$ is a prime number, the order of the group is $\\phi(47) = 47-1 = 46$.\n\nAccording to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element of a finite group must divide the order of the group. Therefore, $k$ must be a divisor of $46$. To find the divisors of $46$, we first find its prime factorization: $46 = 2 \\times 23$. The positive divisors of $46$ are $1$, $2$, $23$, and $46$.\n\nWe are looking for the *least positive* integer $k$, so we must test these divisors in increasing order until we find one that satisfies the condition $2^{k}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$.\n\n1.  Test $k=1$:\n    $2^{1} = 2$. Clearly, $2 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$.\n\n2.  Test $k=2$:\n    $2^{2} = 4$. Clearly, $4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$.\n\n3.  Test $k=23$:\n    We need to compute $2^{23} \\pmod{47}$. We can use the method of binary exponentiation (also known as repeated squaring) to efficiently calculate this value.\n    $2^{1} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{47}$\n    $2^{2} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{47}$\n    $2^{4} \\equiv 4^{2} = 16 \\pmod{47}$\n    $2^{8} \\equiv 16^{2} = 256$. To reduce this modulo $47$, we divide $256$ by $47$. $256 = 5 \\times 47 + 21$, so $2^{8} \\equiv 21 \\pmod{47}$.\n    $2^{16} \\equiv 21^{2} = 441$. To reduce this modulo $47$, we divide $441$ by $47$. $441 = 9 \\times 47 + 18$, so $2^{16} \\equiv 18 \\pmod{47}$.\n\n    Now, we express the exponent $23$ in terms of powers of $2$: $23 = 16 + 4 + 2 + 1$.\n    Therefore, $2^{23} = 2^{16} \\cdot 2^{4} \\cdot 2^{2} \\cdot 2^{1}$.\n    Substituting the congruences we found:\n    $2^{23} \\equiv 18 \\cdot 16 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{47}$\n    We compute the product step-by-step, reducing modulo $47$ at each stage.\n    $18 \\cdot 16 = 288$. To reduce this, $288 = 6 \\times 47 + 6$.

This is the least positive integer $k$ satisfying the given condition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{23}\n$$", "id": "3083933"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of an element's order, we now investigate the group's overall structure by classifying its elements. This practice [@problem_id:3083917] challenges you to identify all elements that share a specific order, reinforcing the connection between the order of an element $g^k$ and the properties of its exponent $k$.

It therefore passes the validation stage. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for all residues $a$ in the multiplicative group of integers modulo $23$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/23\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, such that the order of $a$ is exactly $11$.\n\nThe group in question is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/23\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. Since $p=23$ is a prime number, the elements of this group are the non-zero residue classes modulo $23$, which can be represented by the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 22\\}$. The order of the group, $|G|$, is given by Euler's totient function, $\\varphi(23)$. For any prime $p$, $\\varphi(p) = p-1$. Thus, $|G| = 23 - 1 = 22$.\n\nAccording to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element $a \\in G$, denoted $\\text{ord}(a)$, must be a divisor of the order of the group. The divisors of $|G| = 22$ are $1$, $2$, $11$, and $22$. We are tasked with finding all elements $a$ for which $\\text{ord}(a) = 11$.\n\nA fundamental result in number theory states that for any prime $p$, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is cyclic. This means there exists at least one element $g \\in G$, called a primitive root, whose order is equal to the order of the group. That is, $\\text{ord}(g) = 22$. Such a generator $g$ raises to powers to produce every element of the group, i.e., $G = \\{g^1, g^2, \\dots, g^{22} \\equiv g^0 \\equiv 1\\}$.\n\nLet $a$ be an arbitrary element of $G$. Since $G$ is cyclic, $a$ can be expressed as $a \\equiv g^k \\pmod{23}$ for some integer $k$ in the range $1 \\le k \\le 22$. The order of the element $a = g^k$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{ord}(a) = \\text{ord}(g^k) = \\frac{\\text{ord}(g)}{\\gcd(k, \\text{ord}(g))} $$\nIn our case, $\\text{ord}(g) = 22$, so we have:\n$$ \\text{ord}(a) = \\frac{22}{\\gcd(k, 22)} $$\nWe require $\\text{ord}(a) = 11$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ 11 = \\frac{22}{\\gcd(k, 22)} $$\nSolving for the greatest common divisor, we find $\\gcd(k, 22) = 2$.\n\nWe must now find all integers $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le 22$ and $\\gcd(k, 22) = 2$. The condition $\\gcd(k, 22) = 2$ implies that $k$ must be a multiple of $2$ but not a multiple of any other prime factor of $22$ that is not also a factor of $2$. The prime factorization of $22$ is $2 \\times 11$. Therefore, $k$ must be divisible by $2$ but not by $11$.\nThe integers $k$ in the range $\\{1, \\dots, 22\\}$ that are multiples of $2$ are $\\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22\\}$.\nFrom this set, we must exclude any that are multiples of $11$. The only such value is $22$.\nThus, the valid values for the exponent $k$ are $\\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\\}$.\nThere are $10$ such values of $k$.\n\nThe problem asks us to confirm this count with $\\varphi(11)$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $d$ (where $d|n$) is given by $\\varphi(d)$. Here, $n=22$ and $d=11$. The number of elements of order $11$ is predicted to be $\\varphi(11)$. Since $11$ is a prime number, $\\varphi(11) = 11-1=10$. This matches our count of possible values for $k$, providing a consistency check.\n\nTo find the actual residues $a$, we must first find a primitive root $g$ modulo $23$. We can test small integers. An element $g$ is a primitive root if its order is $22$. This is equivalent to checking that $g^{22/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$ for all prime factors $q$ of $22$. The prime factors are $2$ and $11$. We need to check that $g^2 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$ and $g^{11} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$.\nLet's test $g=5$:\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23}$. Since a result of $1$ was not obtained, $\\text{ord}(5) \\neq 2$.\n$5^{11} \\pmod{23}$: We can compute this as $5 \\cdot (5^2)^5 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2^5 = 5 \\cdot 32 \\pmod{23}$. Since $32 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{23}$, we have $5 \\cdot 9 = 45 \\pmod{23}$. Since $45 = 1 \\cdot 23 + 22$, we find $5^{11} \\equiv 22 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{23}$.\nSince $5^{11} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$, the order of $5$ is not $11$. The order must divide $22$, and it is not $1, 2,$ or $11$. Therefore, $\\text{ord}(5)=22$, and $g=5$ is a primitive root modulo $23$.\n\nNow we can compute the residues $a \\equiv g^k \\pmod{23}$ for the exponents $k \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\\}$ using $g=5$:\n$a_1 \\equiv 5^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_2 \\equiv 5^4 \\equiv (5^2)^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_3 \\equiv 5^6 \\equiv 5^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 4 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_4 \\equiv 5^8 \\equiv 5^6 \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 8 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_5 \\equiv 5^{10} \\equiv 5^8 \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 16 \\cdot 2 = 32 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_6 \\equiv 5^{12} \\equiv 5^{10} \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 9 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_7 \\equiv 5^{14} \\equiv 5^{12} \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 18 \\cdot 2 = 36 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_8 \\equiv 5^{16} \\equiv 5^{14} \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 13 \\cdot 2 = 26 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_9 \\equiv 5^{18} \\equiv 5^{16} \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{23}$\n$a_{10} \\equiv 5^{20} \\equiv 5^{18} \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{23}$\n\nThe set of residues is $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 9, 18, 13, 3, 6, 12\\}$.\nThese $10$ values are distinct because they correspond to distinct powers of the generator $g=5$ (the exponents $k$ are all distinct in the range $1 \\le k \\le 22$).\nBy their construction, each residue $a \\equiv 5^k \\pmod{23}$ with $\\gcd(k, 22) = 2$ has an order of $\\frac{22}{2}=11$. Therefore, these are all the residues of order exactly $11$.\n\nArranging these residues in increasing order, we get: $\\{2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18\\}$.\nThis concludes the derivation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 9 & 12 & 13 & 16 & 18\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3083917"}, {"introduction": "The true power of understanding the cyclic structure of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ lies in its applications to problem-solving.
