Present the final answer as a single integer with no units.", "solution": "The problem asks us to find the multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $13$ and determine if it is a primitive root.\n\nLet $p=13$, a prime number, and let $a=2$. We are interested in the multiplicative order of $a$ modulo $p$, denoted as $\\text{ord}_{p}(a)$ or $\\text{ord}_{13}(2)$. By definition, this is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that $a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, since $13 \\nmid 2$, we have $2^{13-1} \\equiv 2^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. A fundamental property of order is that if $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, then the order $d = \\text{ord}_{p}(a)$ must divide $k$. Therefore, $\\text{ord}_{13}(2)$ must be a divisor of $12$. The set of positive divisors of $12$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$.\n\nAn integer $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if its order is the maximum possible value, $\\phi(p) = p-1$. For $p=13$, this value is $12$. To determine if $2$ is a primitive root modulo $13$, we must check if $\\text{ord}_{13}(2) = 12$.\n\nInstead of checking all smaller powers, we can use a more efficient method based on a general theorem. An element $a$ is a primitive root modulo $n$ if and only if $a^{\\phi(n)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ for every *distinct prime factor* $q$ of $\\phi(n)$.\n\nIn our case, $n=13$, so $\\phi(13) = 12$. The prime factorization of $12$ is $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. The distinct prime factors are $2$ and $3$. Thus, $2$ is a primitive root modulo $13$ if and only if:\n1.  $2^{12/2} = 2^6 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n2.  $2^{12/3} = 2^4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n\nThe logic is that if the order $d$ were a proper divisor of $12$, it would have to divide one of the maximal proper divisors, which are $12/2=6$ and $12/3=4$. So, if we show that neither $2^6$ nor $2^4$ is congruent to $1$, we eliminate all proper divisors as possibilities for the order.\n\nNow, we perform the computations.\nFirst, we compute $2^4 \\pmod{13}$:\n$$2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$2^4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$$\nSince $2^4 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, the order of $2$ cannot be $1, 2,$ or $4$.\n\nNext, we compute $2^6 \\pmod{13}$. We can use the previous result:\n$$2^6 = 2^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 4 = 12 \\pmod{13}$$\nAlternatively, $12 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$.\nSince $2^6 \\equiv 12 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, the order of $2$ cannot be $1, 2, 3,$ or $6$.\n\nWe have shown that $2^4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ and $2^6 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. This eliminates all proper divisors of $12$ as possibilities for $\\text{ord}_{13}(2)$.
