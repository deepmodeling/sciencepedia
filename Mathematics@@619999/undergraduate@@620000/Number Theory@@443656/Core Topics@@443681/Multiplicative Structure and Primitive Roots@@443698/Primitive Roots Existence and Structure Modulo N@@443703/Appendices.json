Let $p$ be a prime. The group of interest is the multiplicative group of invertible residue classes modulo $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The order of this group is $|(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}| = \\varphi(p) = p-1$. An element $g \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if its order, denoted $\\text{ord}_p(g)$, is equal to the order of the group, which is $p-1$.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element $g$ must divide the order of the group. Thus, $\\text{ord}_p(g)$ must be a divisor of $p-1$.\nAn element $g$ is a primitive root if and only if its order is not a proper divisor of $p-1$. A number $d$ is a proper divisor of $n$ if $d|n$ and $d<n$.\n\nLet the prime factorization of $p-1$ be $p-1 = q_1^{a_1} q_2^{a_2} \\cdots q_k^{a_k}$, where $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_i \\ge 1$ are integers.\nIf the order of $g$, let's call it $d$, is a proper divisor of $p-1$, then the ratio $\\frac{p-1}{d}$ must be an integer greater than $1$. This means $\\frac{p-1}{d}$ must have at least one prime factor. Let $q_i$ be a prime factor of $\\frac{p-1}{d}$. Then $d$ must be a divisor of $\\frac{p-1}{q_i}$.\nIf $d | \\frac{p-1}{q_i}$, then we can write $\\frac{p-1}{q_i} = m d$ for some integer $m$. In this case, raising $g$ to the power of $\\frac{p-1}{q_i}$ gives:\n$$g^{(p-1)/q_i} = g^{md} = (g^d)^m \\equiv 1^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$$\nThis shows that if $g$ is *not* a primitive root, its order $d$ is a proper divisor of $p-1$, which in turn implies that there exists at least one distinct prime factor $q_i$ of $p-1$ such that $g^{(p-1)/q_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nConversely, let us assume that for an element $g$, we have $g^{(p-1)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for every distinct prime divisor $q$ of $p-1$. Let $d = \\text{ord}_p(g)$. We know $d | (p-1)$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $d \\neq p-1$. This means $d$ is a proper divisor of $p-1$. As before, this implies that there exists a prime factor $q_i$ of $p-1$ such that $d$ divides $\\frac{p-1}{q_i}$. But this would mean $g^{(p-1)/q_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the order $d$ must be equal to $p-1$.\n\nThis establishes the criterion:\nAn element $g \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if and only if for every distinct prime divisor $q$ of $p-1$, the congruence $g^{(p-1)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ holds.\n\nNow we apply this criterion to the case $p=73$.\nThe order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/73\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $p-1 = 73-1 = 72$.\nWe find the prime factorization of $72$:\n$72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2$.\nThe distinct prime divisors of $72$ are $q_1=2$ and $q_2=3$.\n\nAccording to our derived criterion, an integer $g$ is a primitive root modulo $73$ if and only if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n$1.$ $g^{72/2} \\equiv g^{36} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$\n$2.$ $g^{72/3} \\equiv g^{24} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$\n\nWe now test small positive integer candidates for $g$, starting from $g=2$.\n\nTest $g=2$:\nWe need to compute $2^{36} \\pmod{73}$ and $2^{24} \\pmod{73}$.

Therefore, by Euler's criterion, $4^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 4^{36} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$. The first condition fails, so $g=4$ is not a primitive root.\n\nTest $g=5$:\nWe need to compute $5^{36} \\pmod{73}$ and $5^{24} \\pmod{73}$.\n$5^1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{73}$\n$5^2 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{73}$\n$5^4 \\equiv 25^2 = 625 = 8 \\times 73 + 41 \\equiv 41 \\pmod{73}$\n$5^8 \\equiv 41^2 = 1681 = 23 \\times 73 + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{73}$\n$5^{16} \\equiv 2^2 = 4 \\pmod{73}$\n$5^{32} \\equiv 4^2 = 16 \\pmod{73}$\n\nFirst, check $5^{36} \\pmod{73}$:\n$5^{36} = 5^{32} \\cdot 5^4 \\equiv 16 \\cdot 41 = 656 \\pmod{73}$.\n$656 = 9 \\times 73 - 1 = 657 - 1$. So, $656 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 72 \\pmod{73}$.\nSince $72 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$, the first condition is satisfied.\n\nSecond, check $5^{24} \\pmod{73}$:\n$5^{24} = 5^{16} \\cdot 5^8 \\equiv 4 \\cdot 2 = 8 \\pmod{73}$.\nSince $8 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$, the second condition is also satisfied.\n\nBoth conditions, $5^{36} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$ and $5^{24} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$, are met. Therefore, $g=5$ is a primitive root modulo $73$.\nSince we have tested the candidates $g=2, 3, 4$ and found them not to be primitive roots, $g=5$ is the smallest positive integer that is a primitive root modulo $73$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3088569"}, {"introduction": "The existence of primitive roots is not guaranteed for composite moduli.
