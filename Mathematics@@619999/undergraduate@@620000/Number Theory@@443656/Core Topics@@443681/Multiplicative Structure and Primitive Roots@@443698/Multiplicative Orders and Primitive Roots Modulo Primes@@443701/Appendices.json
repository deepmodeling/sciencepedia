This exercise provides direct practice in applying the definition of order and the efficient criterion for checking if an element is a primitive root. By working through this problem [@problem_id:3087616], you will solidify your understanding of how the order of an element relates to the divisors of $p-1$.", "problem": "Let $p$ be a prime and consider the multiplicative group of units modulo $p$, which has order $p-1$. For an integer $a$ with $1 \\leq a \\leq p-1$, the multiplicative order of $a$ modulo $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{ord}_{p}(a)$, is the least positive integer $n$ such that $a^{n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.

The order of this group is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(71)$, which for a prime $p$ is $p-1$.\nIn this case, the order of the group is $71 - 1 = 70$.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a finite group must divide the order of the group. Therefore, $\\operatorname{ord}_{71}(7)$ must be a divisor of $70$. To find the divisors of $70$, we first determine its prime factorization:\n$$70 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 7$$\nThe positive divisors of $70$ are $1$, $2$, $5$, $7$, $10$, $14$, $35$, and $70$.\n\nAn element $a$ is a primitive root modulo a prime $p$ if its order is exactly $p-1$. To verify if $7$ is a primitive root modulo $71$, we must check if $\\operatorname{ord}_{71}(7) = 70$. This is equivalent to showing that $7^k \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$ for all proper divisors $k$ of $70$.\nA more efficient method is to check only the maximal proper divisors of $p-1$. If the order of $a$ is a proper divisor of $p-1$, it must also divide at least one of the numbers $(p-1)/q$, where $q$ is a prime factor of $p-1$.\nThus, $7$ is a primitive root modulo $71$ if and only if $7^{(70)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$ for each distinct prime factor $q$ of $70$. The prime factors of $70$ are $2$, $5$, and $7$. We must therefore compute and check the following three powers of $7$ modulo $71$:\n1. $7^{70/2} = 7^{35}$\n2. $7^{70/5} = 7^{14}$\n3. $7^{70/7} = 7^{10}$\n\nWe proceed with the computations modulo $71$. We can simplify the calculations by first computing smaller powers of $7$:\n$7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{71}$\n$7^2 \\equiv 49 \\pmod{71}$\n$7^3 \\equiv 49 \\times 7 = 343 \\pmod{71}$. Since $343 = 4 \\times 71 + 59$, we have $7^3 \\equiv 59 \\equiv -12 \\pmod{71}$.\n$7^4 \\equiv 59 \\times 7 = 413 \\pmod{71}$. Since $413 = 5 \\times 71 + 58$, we have $7^4 \\equiv 58 \\equiv -13 \\pmod{71}$.\n$7^5 \\equiv 58 \\times 7 = 406 \\pmod{71}$. Since $406 = 5 \\times 71 + 51$, we have $7^5 \\equiv 51 \\equiv -20 \\pmod{71}$.\n\nNow we can compute the required powers:\n1.  For $7^{10}$:\n    $$7^{10} = (7^5)^2 \\equiv (-20)^2 = 400 \\pmod{71}$$\n    Since $400 = 5 \\times 71 + 45$, we have:\n    $$7^{10} \\equiv 45 \\pmod{71}$$\n    As $45 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$, the order of $7$ is not a divisor of $10$.\n\n2.  For $7^{14}$:\n    $$7^{14} = 7^{10} \\times 7^4 \\equiv 45 \\times 58 \\pmod{71}$$\n    The product is $45 \\times 58 = 2610$. Since $2610 = 36 \\times 71 + 54$, we have:\n    $$7^{14} \\equiv 54 \\pmod{71}$$\n    As $54 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$, the order of $7$ is not a divisor of $14$.\n\n3.  For $7^{35}$:\n    We can use Euler's criterion, which states that for a prime $p$ and an integer $a$ such that $\\gcd(a, p) = 1$, $a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) \\pmod{p}$, where $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ is the Legendre symbol.\n    Here, $p=71$ and $a=7$, so we evaluate $7^{(71-1)/2} = 7^{35}$. We need the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{7}{71}\\right)$. Using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity:\n    $$\\left(\\frac{7}{71}\\right) \\left(\\frac{71}{7}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{7-1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{71-1}{2}} = (-1)^{3 \\cdot 35} = (-1)^{105} = -1$$\n    This implies $\\left(\\frac{7}{71}\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{71}{7}\\right)$.\n    To find $\\left(\\frac{71}{7}\\right)$, we reduce $71$ modulo $7$: $71 = 10 \\times 7 + 1$, so $71 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n    Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{71}{7}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right) = 1$.\n    Substituting this back, we get $\\left(\\frac{7}{71}\\right) = -1$.\n    By Euler's criterion:\n    $$7^{35} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 70 \\pmod{71}$$\n    As $70 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$, the order of $7$ is not a divisor of $35$.\n\nSince we have shown that $7^{10} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$, $7^{14} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$, and $7^{35} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$, the order of $7$ modulo $71$ cannot be any proper divisor of $70$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know $7^{70} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$. Since no smaller positive power $k$ which divides $70$ satisfies $7^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{71}$, the multiplicative order of $7$ must be $70$.\n$$\\operatorname{ord}_{71}(7) = 70$$\nAccording to the definition, an element $a$ is a primitive root modulo a prime $p$ if $\\operatorname{ord}_{p}(a) = p-1$. Since we have found that $\\operatorname{ord}_{71}(7) = 70 = 71 - 1$, we conclude that $7$ is a primitive root modulo $71$.\nFor the final answer format $\\begin{pmatrix}\\operatorname{ord}_{71}(7) & I\\end{pmatrix}$, we have $\\operatorname{ord}_{71}(7) = 70$, and since $7$ is a primitive root, $I=1$.\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 70 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 70 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3087616"}, {"introduction": "After learning to compute the order of a single element, we can zoom out to understand the structure of the entire multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.

The order of this group is $|(\\mathbb{Z}/29\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}| = p-1 = 29-1 = 28$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in number theory states that for any prime $p$, the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, is a cyclic group. Therefore, $(\\mathbb{Z}/29\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a cyclic group of order $28$.\n\nAccording to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element of a finite group must divide the order of the group. Thus, the possible orders of elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/29\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ must be divisors of $28$. The positive divisors of $28$ are found by considering its prime factorization, $28 = 2^2 \\times 7^1$. The divisors are $1$, $2$, $4$, $7$, $14$, and $28$. This confirms that the set of orders given in the problem, $\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\\}$, is the complete set of possible element orders.\n\nFor a finite cyclic group of order $n$, it is a standard result that for each positive divisor $d$ of $n$, the number of elements of order exactly $d$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.
