No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in elementary group theory and number theory. It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique solution. We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the multiplicative group of units modulo $8$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This group consists of all residue classes $[\\bar{a}]$ modulo $8$ such that the greatest common divisor of the representative integer $a$ and $8$ is $1$. The integers $a$ in the range $1 \\le a \\le 8$ that are coprime to $8$ are $1, 3, 5,$ and $7$.\nThis is because $\\gcd(1, 8) = 1$, $\\gcd(3, 8) = 1$, $\\gcd(5, 8) = 1$, and $\\gcd(7, 8) = 1$, while all other integers in this range ($2, 4, 6, 8$) share a common factor greater than $1$ with $8$.\nThus, the elements of the group are:\n$$ (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = \\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{3}], [\\bar{5}], [\\bar{7}]\\} $$\nThe order of the group, denoted by $|(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times|$, is the number of its elements, which is $4$. This is also given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(8) = 8(1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = 4$.\n\nNext, we determine the order of each element in the group. The order of an element $[\\bar{a}]$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $[\\bar{a}]^k = [\\bar{1}]$, where $[\\bar{1}]$ is the identity element of the group.\n\n1.  **Element $[\\bar{1}]$**: By definition, $[\\bar{1}]^1 = [\\bar{1}]$. So, the order of $[\\bar{1}]$ is $1$.\n\n2.  **Element $[\\bar{3}]$**: We compute its powers modulo $8$.\n    $$ [\\bar{3}]^1 = [\\bar{3}] $$\n    $$ [\\bar{3}]^2 = [\\bar{9}] \\equiv [\\bar{1}] \\pmod{8} $$\n    Since we have reached the identity element, the order of $[\\bar{3}]$ is $2$.\n\n3.  **Element $[\\bar{5}]$**: We compute its powers modulo $8$.\n    $$ [\\bar{5}]^1 = [\\bar{5}] $$\n    $$ [\\bar{5}]^2 = [\\bar{25}] \\equiv [\\bar{1}] \\pmod{8} $$\n    The order of $[\\bar{5}]$ is $2$.\n\n4.  **Element $[\\bar{7}]$**: We compute its powers modulo $8$.\n    $$ [\\bar{7}]^1 = [\\bar{7}] $$\n    $$ [\\bar{7}]^2 = [\\bar{49}] \\equiv [\\bar{1}] \\pmod{8} $$\n    The order of $[\\bar{7}]$ is $2$.\n\nTo summarize the orders of the elements:\n- Order of $[\\bar{1}]$ is $1$.\n- Order of $[\\bar{3}]$ is $2$.\n- Order of $[\\bar{5}]$ is $2$.\n- Order of $[\\bar{7}]$ is $2$.\n\nA group is cyclic if and only if there exists an element, called a generator, whose order is equal to the order of the group. The order of our group $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is $4$. However, as we have just calculated, no element in the group has an order of $4$. The maximum order of any element is $2$. Therefore, $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ does not have a generator and is **not a cyclic group**.\n\nThis non-cyclicity has a direct consequence. For any element $[\\bar{g}] \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, the subgroup generated by $[\\bar{g}]$, denoted $\\langle [\\bar{g}] \\rangle$, consists of all powers of $[\\bar{g}]$. The size of this subgroup is equal to the order of $[\\bar{g}]$. Since the maximum order of any element is $2$, the largest subgroup generated by a single element has size $2$. For instance, $\\langle [\\bar{3}] \\rangle = \\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{3}]\\}$.\nBecause the total size of the group is $4$, for any choice of $[\\bar{g}]$, the subgroup $\\langle [\\bar{g}] \\rangle$ is a proper subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This means that there must always be elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ that are not in $\\langle [\\bar{g}] \\rangle$. In other words, for any $[\\bar{g}]$, there exists a unit $[\\bar{u}]$ that is not a power of $[\\bar{g}]$.\n\nThe problem asks for a concrete certificate of this fact for the specific choice of $[\\bar{g}] = [\\bar{5}]$. We need to find a unit $[\\bar{u}] \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ such that $[\\bar{u}]$ cannot be written as a power of $[\\bar{5}]$.\nFirst, let's determine the set of all powers of $[\\bar{5}]$. This is the subgroup generated by $[\\bar{5}]$.\n$$ \\langle [\\bar{5}] \\rangle = \\{ [\\bar{5}]^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} $$\nSince the order of $[\\bar{5}]$ is $2$, the distinct powers are:\n$$ [\\bar{5}]^0 = [\\bar{1}] $$\n$$ [\\bar{5}]^1 = [\\bar{5}] $$\nHigher powers will cycle through these two values (e.g., $[\\bar{5}]^2 = [\\bar{1}]$, $[\\bar{5}]^3 = [\\bar{5}]$, etc.). So, the subgroup generated by $[\\bar{5}]$ is:\n$$ \\langle [\\bar{5}] \\rangle = \\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{5}]\\} $$\nWe are looking for an element $[\\bar{u}] \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ that is not in this subgroup. The full set of elements is $\\{[\\bar{1}], [\\bar{3}], [\\bar{5}], [\\bar{7}]\\}$. The elements not in $\\langle [\\bar{5}] \\rangle$ are $[\\bar{3}]$ and $[\\bar{7}]$.\nEither of these can serve as our $[\\bar{u}]$. The problem states to report the least positive integer representative $u$ for the class $[\\bar{u}]$. The integer representatives for our choices are $3$ and $7$. The least of these is $3$.\nTherefore, we choose $[\\bar{u}] = [\\bar{3}]$. We can verify that $[\\bar{3}]$ is not a power of $[\\bar{5}]$ as $[\\bar{3}] \\ne [\\bar{1}]$ and $[\\bar{3}] \\ne [\\bar{5}]$.

We will systematically address each part of the problem.\n\nFirst, we analyze the cyclicity of the constituent groups, $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ and $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, for $m=3$ and $n=5$.\n\nFor $m=3$, the group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The elements are the residue classes modulo $3$ that are coprime to $3$. These are $\\{[1], [2]\\}$. The order of this group is given by Euler's totient function, $|\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}| = \\phi(3) = 3-1 = 2$. Any group of prime order is cyclic. Since the order is the prime number $2$, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is cyclic. To show this from first principles, we find an element of order $2$. The identity element is $[1]$. The other element is $[2]$. We compute its order: $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The order of $[2]$ is $2$, which equals the order of the group. Therefore, $[2]$ is a generator, confirming that $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a cyclic group of order $2$, which we may denote $C_2$.\n\nFor $n=5$, the group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The elements are $\\{[1], [2], [3], [4]\\}$. The order of this group is $\\phi(5) = 5-1 = 4$. To determine if it is cyclic, we must find an element of order $4$. The order of any element must divide the group order, $4$, so possible orders are $1$, $2$, and $4$.\n- The order of $[1]$ is $1$.\n- The order of $[2]$: $2^1 \\equiv 2$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3$, $2^4 = 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. The order of $[2]$ is $4$.\nSince we have found an element, $[2]$, whose order equals the order of the group, we conclude that $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a cyclic group. It is generated by $[2]$ (and also by $[3]$), and is isomorphic to $C_4$.\n\nNext, we explain why $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is not cyclic. Since $m=3$ and $n=5$ are coprime, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a group isomorphism:\n$$(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$$\nFrom our analysis above, this means $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order $2$ and a cyclic group of order $4$:\n$$(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\cong C_2 \\times C_4$$\nA direct product of finite cyclic groups $C_{n_1} \\times C_{n_2} \\times \\dots \\times C_{n_k}$ is cyclic if and only if their orders $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$ are pairwise coprime. In our case, the orders are $2$ and $4$. Since $\\gcd(2, 4) = 2 \\neq 1$, the group $C_2 \\times C_4$ is not cyclic.\nAlternatively, consider an arbitrary element $(g, h) \\in C_2 \\times C_4$, where $g \\in C_2$ and $h \\in C_4$. The order of this element is $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g), \\text{ord}(h))$. The order of $g$ can be $1$ or $2$. The order of $h$ can be $1$, $2$, or $4$. The maximum possible order of any element in the group is therefore $\\text{lcm}(2, 4) = 4$. The order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $\\phi(15) = \\phi(3)\\phi(5) = (3-1)(5-1) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$. Since the maximum possible order of any element is $4$, which is strictly less than the order of the group, $8$, no single element can generate the entire group. Thus, $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is not cyclic.\n\nThe exponent $e$ of a finite group is the least common multiple of the orders of all its elements. For the direct product group $G = G_1 \\times G_2$, the exponent is $\\text{lcm}(\\text{exp}(G_1), \\text{exp}(G_2))$. For a cyclic group $C_k$, the exponent is its order, $k$.\nThe exponent of $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\cong C_2 \\times C_4$ is:\n$$e = \\text{lcm}(\\text{exp}(C_2), \\text{exp}(C_4)) = \\text{lcm}(2, 4) = 4$$\nSo, the exponent of $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $4$. This confirms our earlier finding that the maximum element order is $4$.\n\nFinally, we must find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{ g \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\mid \\text{ord}(g) = e \\}$. We have determined $e=4$, so we need to find the number of elements of order $4$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. We can count these elements in the isomorphic group $C_2 \\times C_4$.\nAn element $(g, h) \\in C_2 \\times C_4$ has order $\\text{ord}((g, h)) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g), \\text{ord}(h))$. We require this to be $4$.\nThe order of $g \\in C_2$ can be $1$ or $2$.\nThe order of $h \\in C_4$ can be $1$, $2$, or $4$.\nFor $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g), \\text{ord}(h)) = 4$, it is necessary and sufficient that $\\text{ord}(h)=4$. If $\\text{ord}(h)=4$, then $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g), 4) = 4$ for any $\\text{ord}(g)$ that divides $2$ (i.e., $\\text{ord}(g)=1$ or $\\text{ord}(g)=2$).\n\nWe count the number of such pairs $(g, h)$:\n1.  The number of choices for $g \\in C_2$ is the order of the group, which is $2$. These are the identity element (order $1$) and the generator (order $2$).\n2.  The number of choices for $h \\in C_4$ such that $\\text{ord}(h)=4$ is the number of generators of $C_4$. For a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $d$ (where $d|n$) is given by $\\phi(d)$. So, the number of elements of order $4$ in $C_4$ is $\\phi(4) = 4(1 - 1/2) = 2$.\n\nThe total number of elements of order $4$ in $C_2 \\times C_4$ is the product of the number of choices for $g$ and the number of choices for $h$ that satisfy the condition. Since any element $g \\in C_2$ will work as long as $\\text{ord}(h)=4$, the total count is:\n$$|S| = (\\text{number of elements in } C_2) \\times (\\text{number of elements of order } 4 \\text{ in } C_4)$$\n$$|S| = |C_2| \\times \\phi(4) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$$\nTherefore, there are exactly $4$ elements of order $4$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.

The analysis will proceed according to the specified constraints.\n\nFirst, we determine the order of the group, $\\phi(98)$. The problem requires this to be done by counting units from first principles. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/98\\mathbb{Z}$ correspond to integers $a$ such that $1 \\leq a \\leq 98$ and $\\gcd(a, 98) = 1$. The prime factorization of $98$ is $2 \\cdot 7^2$. Therefore, an integer $a$ is relatively prime to $98$ if and only if it is not divisible by $2$ and not divisible by $7$. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion on the set $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 98\\}$.\nLet $A_k$ be the subset of $S$ containing multiples of $k$.\nThe number of integers in $S$ is $|S| = 98$.\nThe number of integers divisible by $2$ is $|A_2| = \\lfloor\\frac{98}{2}\\rfloor = 49$.\nThe number of integers divisible by $7$ is $|A_7| = \\lfloor\\frac{98}{7}\\rfloor = 14$.\nAn integer is not relatively prime to $98$ if it is divisible by $2$ or $7$. The number of such integers is $|A_2 \\cup A_7|$.\nThe set of integers divisible by both $2$ and $7$ is the set of multiples of their least common multiple, which is $14$. The size of this set is $|A_2 \\cap A_7| = |A_{14}| = \\lfloor\\frac{98}{14}\\rfloor = 7$.\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers that are not units is:\n$$|A_2 \\cup A_7| = |A_2| + |A_7| - |A_2 \\cap A_7| = 49 + 14 - 7 = 56$$\nThe number of units, $\\phi(98)$, is the total number of integers minus those that are not units:\n$$\\phi(98) = |S| - |A_2 \\cup A_7| = 98 - 56 = 42$$\n\nSecond, we determine the exponent of the group, $\\lambda(98)$. The Carmichael function $\\lambda(n)$ is the exponent of $\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$. Since $98 = 2 \\cdot 49$ and $\\gcd(2, 49) = 1$, the Chinese Remainder Theorem provides a group isomorphism:\n$$\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 98 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times} \\cong \\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times} \\times \\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 49 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$$\nThe exponent of a direct product of finite abelian groups is the least common multiple of the exponents of the factor groups. Hence:\n$$\\lambda(98) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\lambda(2), \\lambda(49))$$\nWe evaluate the exponent for each factor.\nThe group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ consists of a single element, $[1]_2$.

The exponent is therefore $\\lambda(2) = 1$.\nThe group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 49 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times} = \\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 7^2 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ has order $\\phi(49) = \\phi(7^2) = 7^2 - 7^1 = 49 - 7 = 42$. A standard theorem of number theory states that for an odd prime $p$ and any integer $k \\geq 1$, the group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / p^k \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ is cyclic. Since $7$ is an odd prime, $\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 49 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ is a cyclic group. The exponent of a finite cyclic group is equal to its order. Therefore, $\\lambda(49) = \\phi(49) = 42$.\nCombining these results, we find $\\lambda(98)$:\n$$\\lambda(98) = \\operatorname{lcm}(1, 42) = 42$$\n\nThird, we decide whether a primitive root modulo $98$ exists. A primitive root modulo $n$ exists if and only if the group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ is cyclic. A finite abelian group is cyclic if and only if its exponent is equal to its order.\nWe have determined the order of the group to be $\\phi(98) = 42$ and its exponent to be $\\lambda(98) = 42$.\nSince $\\phi(98) = \\lambda(98)$, the group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / 98 \\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ is indeed cyclic. Consequently, a primitive root modulo $98$ exists. This corresponds to a value of $I=1$ for the indicator variable.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the general criteria for the existence of primitive roots: a primitive root modulo $n$ exists if and only if $n$ is $2$, $4$, $p^k$, or $2p^k$ for an odd prime $p$ and $k \\geq 1$.
