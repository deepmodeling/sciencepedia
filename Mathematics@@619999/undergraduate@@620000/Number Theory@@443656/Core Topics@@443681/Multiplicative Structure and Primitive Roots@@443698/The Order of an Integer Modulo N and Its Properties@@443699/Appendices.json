Your final answer must be a single integer.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the multiplicative order of the integer $3$ modulo $7$, which is denoted as $\\operatorname{ord}_7(3)$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the problem is well-defined. The multiplicative order $\\operatorname{ord}_n(a)$ is defined for an integer $a$ and a positive integer $n \\geq 2$ when $\\gcd(a,n)=1$. In this problem, we are given $a=3$ and $n=7$. Since $7$ is a prime number and $3$ is not a multiple of $7$, the greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(3,7)=1$. Therefore, the order $\\operatorname{ord}_7(3)$ is a well-defined concept.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of the multiplicative order: $\\operatorname{ord}_n(a)$ is the *least positive integer* $k$ such that the congruence $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ holds. To find $\\operatorname{ord}_7(3)$, we must find the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the congruence $3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nThe problem explicitly instructs that the minimality of $k$ must be justified by direct verification that no smaller positive integer exponent yields a residue of $1$. Following this directive, we shall compute the powers of $3$ modulo $7$ for successive positive integer values of the exponent $k$, beginning with $k=1$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$3^1 = 3$, which implies $3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. The residue is not $1$.\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$3^2 = 9$. We compute the remainder of $9$ upon division by $7$: $9 = 1 \\cdot 7 + 2$. Thus, $3^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. The residue is not $1$.\n\nFor $k=3$:\nUsing the result for $k=2$, we have $3^3 = 3^2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 2 \\cdot 3 = 6 \\pmod{7}$. The residue is not $1$.\n\nFor $k=4$:\nUsing the result for $k=3$, we have $3^4 = 3^3 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 6 \\cdot 3 = 18$. We compute the remainder of $18$ upon division by $7$: $18 = 2 \\cdot 7 + 4$. Thus, $3^4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. The residue is not $1$.\n\nFor $k=5$:\nUsing the result for $k=4$, we have $3^5 = 3^4 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 4 \\cdot 3 = 12$. We compute the remainder of $12$ upon division by $7$: $12 = 1 \\cdot 7 + 5$. Thus, $3^5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$.

Thus, $3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nWe have found that $k=6$ is a positive integer for which $3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. The preceding calculations for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ demonstrated that for all positive integers smaller than $6$, the congruence $3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ does not hold. The respective residues were $3, 2, 6, 4, 5$. Since $k=6$ is the first positive integer exponent that satisfies the required congruence, it is, by definition, the least such integer.\n\nTherefore, the multiplicative order of $3$ modulo $7$ is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "3092668"}, {"introduction": "While direct calculation builds intuition, it can be inefficient for larger numbers.

The multiplicative order of $a$ modulo $n$, which we denote by $k = \\operatorname{ord}_{n}(a)$, is defined as the least positive integer $k$ such that $a^{k} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. Euler's theorem states that $a^{\\varphi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.\n\nWe want to show that $k$ divides $\\varphi(n)$. We can use the Division Algorithm to divide $\\varphi(n)$ by $k$. This yields two unique integers, a quotient $q$ and a remainder $r$, such that:\n$$ \\varphi(n) = qk + r, \\quad \\text{where } 0 \\le r  k $$\nNow, we can use this expression for $\\varphi(n)$ in the congruence from Euler's theorem:\n$$ a^{\\varphi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} $$\nSubstituting $qk+r$ for $\\varphi(n)$, we get:\n$$ a^{qk+r} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} $$\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can rewrite the left side:\n$$ a^{qk} \\cdot a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} $$\n$$ (a^k)^q \\cdot a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} $$\nBy the definition of the order $k$, we know that $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. Substituting this into our congruence gives:\n$$ (1)^q \\cdot a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} $$\n$$ a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} $$\nNow we must consider the possible values for the remainder $r$. From the Division Algorithm, we know that $0 \\le r  k$.\nIf $r  0$, then $a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ would mean we have found a positive integer $r$ that is smaller than $k$ for which the congruence holds. This directly contradicts the definition of $k = \\operatorname{ord}_{n}(a)$ as the *least* positive integer with this property. Therefore, the case $r0$ is impossible.\nThe only remaining possibility for the remainder is $r=0$.\nIf $r=0$, the equation from the Division Algorithm becomes $\\varphi(n) = qk$. This equation implies that $k$ is a divisor of $\\varphi(n)$.\nThis completes the justification. To find $\\operatorname{ord}_{n}(a)$, it is sufficient to test only the positive divisors of $\\varphi(n)$, as the order must be one of them. We would test them in increasing order, and the first divisor $d$ for which $a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ is the order.\n\nSecond, we compute $\\operatorname{ord}_{21}(4)$.\nWe are given $n=21$ and $a=4$. We must first verify that the condition $\\gcd(a,n)=1$ is met. The integer $4$ has prime factors $2^2$. The integer $21$ has prime factors $3$ and $7$. Since there are no common prime factors, $\\gcd(4, 21) = 1$. The condition holds.\n\nNext, we compute $\\varphi(21)$. Since Euler's totient function is multiplicative and $21 = 3 \\times 7$ with $\\gcd(3,7)=1$, we can write:\n$$ \\varphi(21) = \\varphi(3) \\cdot \\varphi(7) $$\nFor any prime number $p$, $\\varphi(p) = p-1$. Thus, $\\varphi(3) = 3-1 = 2$ and $\\varphi(7) = 7-1 = 6$.\n$$ \\varphi(21) = 2 \\cdot 6 = 12 $$\nBased on our earlier proof, $\\operatorname{ord}_{21}(4)$ must be a positive divisor of $12$. The positive divisors of $12$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, and $12$. We now check these divisors in ascending order until we find the smallest value $k$ such that $4^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$$ 4^1 = 4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{21} $$\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$$ 4^2 = 16 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{21} $$\n\nFor $k=3$:\n$$ 4^3 = 64 $$\nTo evaluate this modulo $21$, we divide $64$ by $21$. $64 = 3 \\times 21 + 1$. Therefore:\n$$ 4^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21} $$\nSince we have found the smallest positive divisor of $12$ for which the congruence is true, we have found the order.\nThus, $\\operatorname{ord}_{21}(4) = 3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3092571"}, {"introduction": "How do we handle calculations when the modulus $n$ is a large composite number?
