It is a standard computational exercise in algebraic number theory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid and well-posed. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires us to perform Euclidean division for the Gaussian integers $a=11+7i$ and $b=4+i$. The division algorithm is given by $a=bq+r$, where $q,r \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $N(r)  N(b)$. The quotient $q$ is specified to be the Gaussian integer nearest to the complex number $\\frac{a}{b}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the complex quotient $\\frac{a}{b}$:\n$$ \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{11+7i}{4+i} $$\nTo express this in the standard form $x+yi$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $4-i$:\n$$ \\frac{11+7i}{4+i} = \\frac{(11+7i)(4-i)}{(4+i)(4-i)} $$\nThe numerator is:\n$$ (11+7i)(4-i) = 11(4) - 11(i) + 7i(4) - 7i(i) = 44 - 11i + 28i - 7i^2 = 44 + 17i - 7(-1) = 44 + 17i + 7 = 51+17i $$\nThe denominator is the norm of $b$:\n$$ (4+i)(4-i) = 4^2 - i^2 = 16 - (-1) = 17 $$\nSo the quotient is:\n$$ \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{51+17i}{17} = \\frac{51}{17} + \\frac{17}{17}i = 3+i $$\nThe complex quotient $\\frac{a}{b}$ is exactly $3+i$.\n\nNext, we find the quotient $q$, which is the Gaussian integer nearest to $3+i$. A Gaussian integer is a number of the form $u+vi$ where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The standard method to find the nearest Gaussian integer to a complex number $x+yi$ is to round $x$ and $y$ to their nearest integers.\nIn this case, the complex number is $3+i$. Its real part is $3$ and its imaginary part is $1$. Since both $3$ and $1$ are already integers, the complex number $3+i$ is itself a Gaussian integer. The distance from $3+i$ to itself is $0$, so it is its own nearest Gaussian integer.\nTherefore, we choose the quotient $q$ to be:\n$$ q = 3+i $$\n\nNow we find the remainder $r$ using the relation $r = a - bq$:\n$$ r = (11+7i) - (4+i)(3+i) $$\nWe have already computed the product $(4+i)(3+i)$ implicitly when we computed the numerator of the fraction. Let's verify:\n$$ (4+i)(3+i) = 4(3) + 4(i) + i(3) + i(i) = 12 + 4i + 3i + i^2 = 12 + 7i - 1 = 11+7i $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $r$:\n$$ r = (11+7i) - (11+7i) = 0 $$\nThe remainder $r$ is $0$, which can be written as the Gaussian integer $0+0i$.\n\nFinally, we need to compute the norm of the remainder, $N(r)$. The norm is defined as $N(x+yi) = x^2+y^2$. For $r=0=0+0i$:\n$$ N(r) = N(0+0i) = 0^2 + 0^2 = 0 $$\nAs a consistency check, the Euclidean algorithm requires that $N(r)  N(b)$. Let's compute $N(b)$:\n$$ N(b) = N(4+i) = 4^2 + 1^2 = 16+1 = 17 $$\nThe condition $N(r)  N(b)$ becomes $0  17$, which is true. The entire procedure is consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the norm $N(r)$ of the resulting remainder. The calculated value is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3087661"}, {"introduction": "Why study Gaussian integers? One powerful reason is that their structure can solve problems that are purely about ordinary integers.

Because $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), factorization into irreducibles is unique up to associates and ordering of factors.\n\nWe apply these facts to the rational prime $13$. To show $13$ is reducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, it suffices to find $\\alpha,\\beta\\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $13$ divides $\\alpha\\beta$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ while $13$ divides neither $\\alpha$ nor $\\beta$.

Therefore the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $13$ and $5+i$ is $2+3i$ up to multiplication by a unit. Because $\\gcd(13,5+i)$ divides $13$, we obtain a factorization\n$$\n13=(2+3i)(2-3i).\n$$\nSince $N(2+3i)=13$, both $2+3i$ and $2-3i$ are irreducible (indeed, Gaussian primes).

In a UFD, the factorization of $13$ is unique up to associates and order. Therefore, any Gaussian integer of norm $13$ must be an associate of either $2+3i$ or its conjugate $2-3i$. The associates of $2+3i$ are obtained by multiplying by units:\n$$\n\\{\\pm(2+3i),\\ \\pm i(2+3i)\\}=\\{2+3i,\\ -2-3i,\\ -3+2i,\\ 3-2i\\}.\n$$\nTheir conjugates give the remaining four Gaussian integers of norm $13$:\n$$\n\\{2-3i,\\ -2+3i,\\ 3+2i,\\ -3-2i\\}.\n$$\nEach element $a+bi$ in this list yields a solution to $a^{2}+b^{2}=13$.

By direct computation in the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, we have:\n$$ (1+i)^{2} = 1^{2} + 2(1)(i) + i^{2} = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i $$\nThus, the ideal generated by $(1+i)^{2}$ is the same as the principal ideal generated by $2i$, i.e., $I = (2i)$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the element $i$ is a unit, as its inverse is $-i$ (since $i(-i) = 1$). In a commutative ring, two elements that differ by a unit factor generate the same ideal. Therefore, the ideal $(2i)$ is identical to the ideal generated by $(2i)(-i) = 2$.\n$$ I = ((1+i)^{2}) = (2i) = (2) $$\nThe quotient ring in question is therefore $R = \\mathbb{Z}[i]/(2)$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of elements in this quotient ring.
