While the explicit structure of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is not given, its existence and uniqueness are standard in the field, and its determination is a prerequisite for solving the problem.

The two $\\mathbb{Q}$-embeddings are $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. As they are $\\mathbb{Q}$-embeddings, they fix $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe first embedding, $\\sigma_1$, is defined by $\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{5})=\\sqrt{5}$.

An element is in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ if it can be written as $a+b(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})$ for integers $a$ and $b$.\nWe set $\\alpha = 3+2\\sqrt{5}$ equal to this form:\n$$\n3+2\\sqrt{5} = a + \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\sqrt{5} = (a+\\frac{b}{2}) + (\\frac{b}{2})\\sqrt{5}\n$$\nEquating the coefficients of $\\sqrt{5}$ gives $2 = \\frac{b}{2}$, which implies $b=4$.\nEquating the rational parts gives $3 = a+\\frac{b}{2} = a+\\frac{4}{2} = a+2$, which implies $a=1$.\nSince $a=1$ and $b=4$ are both integers, $\\alpha = 1+4(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})$ is indeed an element of $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nNext, we determine the condition for an element of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ to be a unit, using only the provided definitions. A unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is an element $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ that has a multiplicative inverse $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\\beta\\gamma = 1$.\nTaking the norm of both sides of this equation, we have $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta\\gamma) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1)$.\nThe norm of $1$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1) = \\sigma_1(1)\\sigma_2(1) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nUsing the given multiplicative property of the norm, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta\\gamma) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma)$.\nTherefore, we have the equation $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma) = 1$.\n\nAn essential property of algebraic integers is that their field norms (and traces) are rational integers. For any $\\beta = \\frac{c+d\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ (where $c,d \\in \\mathbb{Z}, c\\equiv d \\pmod 2$), its norm is:\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) = \\frac{c^2 - 5d^2}{4}\n$$\nSince $c \\equiv d \\pmod 2$, either both $c$ and $d$ are even, or both are odd.\nIf both are even, $c=2m, d=2n$. Then $c^2-5d^2 = 4m^2-20n^2 = 4(m^2-5n^2)$, which is divisible by $4$.\nIf both are odd, $c=2m+1, d=2n+1$. Then $c^2 = 4m^2+4m+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $d^2 = 4n^2+4n+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. So $c^2-5d^2 \\equiv 1-5(1) = -4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\nIn both cases, $c^2-5d^2$ is divisible by $4$, so $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$ is an integer.\n\nSince both $\\beta$ and its inverse $\\gamma$ are in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, their norms $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$ and $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma)$ must both be integers. The equation $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma) = 1$ requires the product of two integers to be $1$. The only pairs of integers that satisfy this are $(1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$.\nThus, a necessary condition for an element $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ to be a unit is that its norm must be $\\pm 1$. This condition is also sufficient, as the inverse $\\beta^{-1} = \\frac{\\sigma_2(\\beta)}{N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)} = \\pm \\sigma_2(\\beta)$ would also be an algebraic integer.\n\nWe apply this condition to our element $\\alpha=3+2\\sqrt{5}$. We calculated its norm to be:\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = -11\n$$\nSince $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = -11 \\neq \\pm 1$, the element $\\alpha$ is not a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nTherefore, for the final answer, the value of $u$ is $0$.\n\nThe final results are $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)=-11$, $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)=6$, and $u=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -11  6  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3093852"}, {"introduction": "With the ability to test for units, we can now attempt to find the complete set of units for a given quadratic field.

We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for several related tasks concerning the quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$. We will address each in sequence.\n\nFirst, we determine the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of the field $K$. A quadratic field is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer. In our case, $d = -5$, which is square-free. The structure of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ depends on the congruence of $d$ modulo $4$. The standard classification is as follows:\n- If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right]$.\n- If $d \\equiv 2$ or $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\n\nFor $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, we have $d = -5$. We check the congruence: $-5 = -8 + 3 = 4(-2) + 3$. Thus, $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. According to the classification, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. This means that the elements of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ are of the form $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers ($a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n\nNext, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for an element of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ to be a unit. By definition, an element $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit if it has a multiplicative inverse in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. That is, there exists an element $v \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that $uv = 1$.\n\nWe use the field norm $N: K \\to \\mathbb{Q}$. For an element $\\alpha = x + y\\sqrt{-5} \\in K$ (with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$), the norm is defined as $N(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\bar{\\alpha}$, where $\\bar{\\alpha} = x - y\\sqrt{-5}$ is the conjugate of $\\alpha$.\n$N(\\alpha) = (x + y\\sqrt{-5})(x - y\\sqrt{-5}) = x^2 - (y\\sqrt{-5})^2 = x^2 - y^2(-5) = x^2 + 5y^2$.\nIf $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$ is an element of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, then $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and its norm $N(\\alpha) = a^2 + 5b^2$ is also an integer.\n\nNow, we will show that an element $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit if and only if its norm is $N(u) = \\pm 1$.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit. By definition, there exists $v \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that $uv = 1$. Applying the norm to both sides of this equation, we get $N(uv) = N(1)$. The norm is a multiplicative function, so $N(u)N(v) = N(1)$. The norm of $1 = 1 + 0\\sqrt{-5}$ is $N(1) = 1^2 + 5(0)^2 = 1$. Thus, we have the equation $N(u)N(v) = 1$. Since $u$ and $v$ are in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, their norms, $N(u)$ and $N(v)$, are integers. The only way the product of two integers can be $1$ is if they are both $1$ or both $-1$. Therefore, it is necessary that $N(u) = \\pm 1$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is an element with norm $N(u) = \\pm 1$. The norm of $u$ is $N(u) = u\\bar{u}$. So, we have $u\\bar{u} = \\pm 1$. This equation implies that $u$ has a multiplicative inverse, specifically $\\pm\\bar{u}$. To show that $u$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, we must verify that its inverse is also an element of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Let $u = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Its conjugate is $\\bar{u} = a - b\\sqrt{-5}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $-b$ is also an integer. Thus, $\\bar{u}$ is of the form $a' + b'\\sqrt{-5}$ with $a', b' \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (specifically $a'=a, b'=-b$), which means $\\bar{u} \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] = \\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Consequently, the inverse of $u$, which is either $\\bar{u}$ or $-\\bar{u}$, is also in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Therefore, $u$ is a unit.\n\nThis completes the derivation. An element $u = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit if and only if $N(u) = a^2+5b^2 = \\pm 1$.\n\nNow, we identify all units of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ by finding all integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the equation $a^2 + 5b^2 = \\pm 1$.\nSince $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $a^2 \\ge 0$ and $b^2 \\ge 0$. This implies that $a^2 + 5b^2 \\ge 0$. Hence, the case $a^2 + 5b^2 = -1$ is impossible. We only need to solve the Diophantine equation:\n$$a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$$\nWe analyze the possible integer values for $b$.\n- If $b=0$, the equation simplifies to $a^2 = 1$. The integer solutions for $a$ are $a=1$ and $a=-1$. This gives us two pairs of solutions: $(a, b) = (1, 0)$ and $(a, b) = (-1, 0)$.\nThese correspond to the elements $u_1 = 1 + 0\\sqrt{-5} = 1$ and $u_2 = -1 + 0\\sqrt{-5} = -1$.\n- If $b \\neq 0$, then $|b| \\ge 1$, which implies $b^2 \\ge 1$. In this case, $5b^2 \\ge 5$. Since $a^2 \\ge 0$, the left side of the equation is $a^2 + 5b^2 \\ge 0 + 5 = 5$. The equation $a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$ cannot be satisfied for any integer $a$. Therefore, there are no solutions when $b \\neq 0$.\n\nThe only integer solutions to the norm equation are $(1, 0)$ and $(-1, 0)$. This means that the only units in $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ are $1$ and $-1$. Our list is complete because we have exhaustively considered all possible integer solutions to the unit condition equation.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the sum of all distinct units in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$.

Rearranging, we have $4Dp^2 = q^2(m^2 - 4k)$, which shows that $q^2$ must divide $4Dp^2$. Since $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, we have $\\gcd(p^2,q^2)=1$, so $q^2$ must divide $4D$. As $D$ is square-free, the only square factors of $4D$ are $1$ and $4$. Hence, $q^2=1$ or $q^2=4$, which implies $q=1$ or $q=2$.\n\nCase A: $q=1$. Then $v=p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.

Since $2+\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.732  1$, this is the fundamental unit.\n\nThe two fundamental units are $\\varepsilon_2 = 1+\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\varepsilon_3 = 2+\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe present these in a single row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\sqrt{2}  2+\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3093863"}]}
