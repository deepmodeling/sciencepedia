The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles. The constraints are clear and direct the method of solution without rendering the problem trivial. It is not ill-posed, as the sets of units for these rings are well-defined and their cardinalities are finite, leading to a unique integer value for $T$. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Formal Definition of a Unit**\n\nLet $R$ be a commutative ring with a multiplicative identity element, denoted as $1_R$. An element $u \\in R$ is called a unit if there exists an element $v \\in R$ such that $uv = 1_R$. Since the ring $R$ is commutative, the condition $uv = 1_R$ automatically implies $vu = 1_R$. The element $v$ is called the multiplicative inverse of $u$ and is often denoted by $u^{-1}$. The set of all units in $R$ forms a group under multiplication, denoted $\\mathcal{U}(R)$.\n\n**Part 2: Units in the Ring of Integers $\\mathbb{Z}$**\n\nThe ring of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$, is a commutative ring with multiplicative identity $1$. To find the units of $\\mathbb{Z}$, we seek all integers $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for which there exists an integer $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that their product is $1$.\n$$\nuv = 1\n$$\nIf such integers $u$ and $v$ exist, we can take the absolute value of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n|uv| = |1|\n$$\n$$\n|u| |v| = 1\n$$\nSince $u$ and $v$ are integers, their absolute values, $|u|$ and $|v|$, must be non-negative integers. The only way the product of two non-negative integers can be $1$ is if both are equal to $1$.\n$$\n|u| = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |v| = 1\n$$\nThe integers $u$ satisfying $|u| = 1$ are $u=1$ and $u=-1$. We verify that these are indeed units:\n- If $u=1$, its inverse is $v=1$, since $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n- If $u=-1$, its inverse is $v=-1$, since $(-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$.\nTherefore, the set of units in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $\\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\{1, -1\\}$. The cardinality of this set is:\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{Z})\\right| = 2\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Units in the Ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$**\n\nThe ring of quadratic integers $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] = \\{ a + b\\sqrt{-5} \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}\n$$\nThis is a commutative ring with identity $1 = 1 + 0\\sqrt{-5}$. Let $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$ be a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. By definition, there exists an element $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ such that $\\alpha\\beta = 1$.\n\nAs specified, we use the field norm $N$ from the field of fractions $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ to the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. For any element $x = p + q\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ (with $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$), the norm is defined as:\n$$\nN(x) = N(p + q\\sqrt{-5}) = (p + q\\sqrt{-5})(p - q\\sqrt{-5}) = p^2 + 5q^2\n$$\nThe norm is multiplicative, meaning for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, $N(xy) = N(x)N(y)$.\n\nApplying the norm to the equation $\\alpha\\beta = 1$, we get:\n$$\nN(\\alpha\\beta) = N(1)\n$$\nUsing the multiplicativity of the norm:\n$$\nN(\\alpha)N(\\beta) = N(1)\n$$\nThe norm of the identity element $1 = 1 + 0\\sqrt{-5}$ is $N(1) = 1^2 + 5(0^2) = 1$. So, we have:\n$$\nN(\\alpha)N(\\beta) = 1\n$$\nFor an element $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, its coefficients $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus, its norm $N(\\alpha) = a^2 + 5b^2$ is an integer. Similarly, if $\\beta = c+d\\sqrt{-5}$ with $c,d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, its norm $N(\\beta) = c^2+5d^2$ is also an integer. Furthermore, since $a^2 \\ge 0$ and $5b^2 \\ge 0$, the norm $N(\\alpha)$ must be a non-negative integer.\n\nThe equation $N(\\alpha)N(\\beta) = 1$, where $N(\\alpha)$ and $N(\\beta)$ are non-negative integers, implies that both must be equal to $1$.\n$$\nN(\\alpha) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the norm for $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$:\n$$\na^2 + 5b^2 = 1\n$$\nWe must find all integer solutions $(a,b)$ to this Diophantine equation.\n- If $b=0$, the equation simplifies to $a^2 = 1$. The integer solutions are $a=1$ and $a=-1$. This gives two candidate elements:\n  - $(a,b) = (1,0) \\implies \\alpha = 1 + 0\\sqrt{-5} = 1$\n  - $(a,b) = (-1,0) \\implies \\alpha = -1 + 0\\sqrt{-5} = -1$\n- If $b \\neq 0$, then since $b$ is an integer, $|b| \\geq 1$, which implies $b^2 \\geq 1$. Consequently, $5b^2 \\geq 5$. Since $a^2 \\geq 0$, we have $a^2 + 5b^2 \\geq 0 + 5 = 5$. This contradicts the equation $a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$. Thus, there are no solutions with $b \\neq 0$.\n\nThe only possible elements that can be units are $1$ and $-1$. We verify they are indeed units:\n- For $\\alpha=1$, its inverse is $\\beta=1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, since $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n- For $\\alpha=-1$, its inverse is $\\beta=-1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, since $(-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$.\n\nSo, the set of units in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ is $\\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]) = \\{1, -1\\}$. The cardinality of this set is:\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}])\\right| = 2\n$$\n\n**Part 4: Computation of $T$**\n\nWe are asked to compute the integer $T = \\left|\\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{Z})\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}])\\right|$.\nUsing the results from the previous parts:\n$$\nT = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3085103"}, {"introduction": "When the factorization of elements fails to be unique, mathematicians restore order by shifting their focus to ideals.

First, for the ideal $I=(2,\\,1+\\sqrt{-5})$, we must construct its inverse fractional ideal $J$. Second, we must compute the product of $I$ and its conjugate ideal $\\overline{I}=(2,\\,1-\\sqrt{-5})$ and identify the generator of the resulting principal ideal. The final answer is this generator.\n\nLet us begin by addressing the second task, as its result is instrumental for the first. We are asked to compute the ideal product $I \\cdot \\overline{I}$.\n\nBy the definition of ideal multiplication, the product ideal $I \\cdot \\overline{I}$ is the ideal generated by all possible products of the generators of $I$ and $\\overline{I}$. The generators of $I$ are $2$ and $1+\\sqrt{-5}$, and the generators of $\\overline{I}$ are $2$ and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$. The products of these generators are:\n1.  $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$\n2.  $2 \\cdot (1-\\sqrt{-5}) = 2 - 2\\sqrt{-5}$\n3.  $(1+\\sqrt{-5}) \\cdot 2 = 2 + 2\\sqrt{-5}$\n4.  $(1+\\sqrt{-5}) \\cdot (1-\\sqrt{-5}) = 1^{2} - (\\sqrt{-5})^{2} = 1 - (-5) = 6$\n\nThus, the product ideal is generated by these four elements:\n$$I \\cdot \\overline{I} = (4, \\, 2 - 2\\sqrt{-5}, \\, 2 + 2\\sqrt{-5}, \\, 6)$$\nWe now seek to simplify this set of generators to determine if the ideal is principal. Let the product ideal be denoted by $P$. An ideal is an additive subgroup of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, so any integer linear combination of its elements is also in the ideal. The coefficients of the linear combination must be in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Taking integer coefficients is a special case.\n\nWe observe that both $4$ and $6$ are elements of $P$. Therefore, their difference, $6 - 4 = 2$, must also be an element of $P$. This is because $6 \\in P$ and $4 \\in P$ implies $1 \\cdot 6 + (-1) \\cdot 4 \\in P$, and since $1$ and $-1$ are elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the element $2$ must be in $P$.\n\nThe fact that $2 \\in P$ implies that the principal ideal $(2)$ generated by $2$ is a subset of $P$, i.e., $(2) \\subseteq P$. The ideal $(2)$ consists of all multiples of $2$ by elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$: $(2) = \\{2\\alpha \\mid \\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K\\}$.\n\nNext, we check if the reverse inclusion, $P \\subseteq (2)$, holds. This requires showing that every generator of $P$ is an element of $(2)$.\n1.  Is $4 \\in (2)$? Yes, because $4 = 2 \\cdot 2$, and $2 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n2.  Is $2 - 2\\sqrt{-5} \\in (2)$? Yes, because $2 - 2\\sqrt{-5} = 2(1 - \\sqrt{-5})$, and $1 - \\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n3.  Is $2 + 2\\sqrt{-5} \\in (2)$? Yes, because $2 + 2\\sqrt{-5} = 2(1 + \\sqrt{-5})$, and $1 + \\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n4.  Is $6 \\in (2)$? Yes, because $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$, and $3 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nSince all four generators of $P$ are elements of the ideal $(2)$, any $\\mathcal{O}_K$-linear combination of these generators must also be in $(2)$. Therefore, the ideal $P$ itself is a subset of $(2)$, i.e., $P \\subseteq (2)$.\n\nCombining the two inclusions, $(2) \\subseteq P$ and $P \\subseteq (2)$, we conclude that $P = I \\cdot \\overline{I} = (2)$.\nThe ideal product $I \\cdot \\overline{I}$ is the principal ideal generated by the integer $2$.\nA principal ideal $(g)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is also generated by $u \\cdot g$, where $u$ is any unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The units of $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ are the elements $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that their norm $N(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^{2}+5b^{2}$ is equal to $\\pm 1$. The only integer solutions to $a^{2}+5b^{2}=1$ are $(a,b) = (\\pm 1, 0)$. Thus, the units are $\\{1, -1\\}$.\nThe ideal $(2)$ can be generated by $2$ or by $-2$. By convention, for an ideal generated by a rational integer, the positive generator is chosen. This generator is also the norm of the ideal $I$. The generator is $2$.\n\nNow, we address the first task: constructing a fractional ideal $J$ such that $I \\cdot J = (1)$.\nFrom our calculation above, we have the relation $I \\cdot \\overline{I} = (2)$.\nIn the context of ideals, this means $I \\cdot \\overline{I} = 2\\mathcal{O}_K$. If we formally multiply by the element $\\frac{1}{2} \\in K$, we get:\n$$I \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\overline{I}\\right) = \\mathcal{O}_K = (1)$$\nLet us define the candidate for the inverse ideal as $J = \\frac{1}{2}\\overline{I}$.\nWe must verify that $J$ is a fractional ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. A non-zero subset $J \\subset K$ is a fractional ideal if it is an $\\mathcal{O}_K$-module and there exists a non-zero element $c \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $c J \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$.\nLet's choose $c=2$. The element $2$ is non-zero and belongs to $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nThen, $c J = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\overline{I}\\right) = \\overline{I}$. Since $\\overline{I}$ is an ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, it is by definition a subset of $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nThus, we have found a non-zero $c=2 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $c J \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$. This confirms that $J = \\frac{1}{2}\\overline{I}$ is a fractional ideal.\n\nFinally, we confirm the product:\n$$I \\cdot J = I \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\overline{I}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (I \\cdot \\overline{I})$$\nThe set $\\frac{1}{2}(I \\cdot \\overline{I})$ consists of all elements $\\frac{x}{2}$ where $x \\in I \\cdot \\overline{I}$. Since we have shown that $I \\cdot \\overline{I} = (2)$, any element $x$ can be written as $x=2\\alpha$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\nTherefore, any element of $I \\cdot J$ is of the form $\\frac{2\\alpha}{2} = \\alpha$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. The set of all such elements is precisely $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nThe ideal $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is also denoted by $(1)$, since it is the principal ideal generated by the multiplicative identity.\nSo, we have successfully constructed $J = \\frac{1}{2}\\overline{I}$ and verified that $I \\cdot J = (1)$.\n\nThe overall problem asks for the unique integer generator of $I \\cdot \\overline{I}$.

This ideal represents the identity element in the class group.\nFor ideals with norm $N(\\mathfrak{a})=2$, these must be prime ideals lying over the rational prime $p=2$. To find these ideals, we consider the factorization of the principal ideal $(2)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. We examine the polynomial $f(x) = x^2+5$ modulo $2$.\n$$ x^2 + 5 \\equiv x^2 + 1 \\pmod{2} $$\nThis polynomial factors as $(x+1)^2$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$. This indicates that the prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.

We can verify the norm of $\\mathfrak{p}_2$. The norm of a principal ideal $(a)$ is $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a)|$. So, $N((2)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)| = |2^2| = 4$.\nSince $N((2)) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2^2) = (N(\\mathfrak{p}_2))^2$, we have $(N(\\mathfrak{p}_2))^2 = 4$, which implies $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 2$.\nThe only prime ideal with norm $2$ is $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. Therefore, the class group is generated by the class of this ideal, denoted $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\n\nNext, we identify if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a principal ideal and determine the order of its class.\nTo check if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is principal, we search for an element $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ (where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) such that $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$. If such an element exists, its norm must match the norm of the ideal: $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 2$.\nThe norm of $\\alpha$ is given by $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2+5b^2$. So we must solve the Diophantine equation:\n$$ a^2 + 5b^2 = 2 $$\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $b^2 \\geq 1$, which implies $5b^2 \\geq 5$. This would make $a^2+5b^2 > 2$.\nThus, we must have $b=0$. The equation then simplifies to $a^2 = 2$. There is no integer solution for $a$.\nTherefore, there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ with norm $2$. This proves that the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not a principal ideal. Its class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is not the identity element in the ideal class group.\n\nFinally, we determine the order of the class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. We consider the square of the ideal, $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$. From the factorization of $(2)$, we already established that $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2)$. The ideal $(2)$ is a principal ideal generated by the element $2 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\nIn the language of the class group, this means:\n$$ [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [(2)] = [(1)] $$\nwhere $[(1)]$ is the identity element.\nThis shows that the class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ has order $2$.
