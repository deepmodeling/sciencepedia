No rounding is required.", "solution": "First, we determine the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ for the quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$. A number field of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ a square-free integer has its ring of integers given by $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. In our case, $d = -5$. Since $-5$ is a square-free integer and $-5 = -8+3$, we have $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore, the ring of integers of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. The elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are of the form $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSecond, we compute the norm of the ideal $I = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The norm of an ideal $I$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is defined as the cardinality of the quotient ring, $N(I) = |\\mathcal{O}_K/I|$. We need to determine the number of elements in the ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/I = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]/(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. In this quotient ring, the generators of the ideal $I$ are equivalent to $0$. Thus, we have the relations $2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$ and $1+\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$. From the second relation, we deduce that $\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{I}$. Now, consider an arbitrary element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In the quotient ring, we can substitute $\\sqrt{-5}$ with $-1$:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv a+b(-1) \\pmod{I} \\equiv a-b \\pmod{I}$$\nThis shows that every element in $\\mathcal{O}_K/I$ is congruent to an integer. Furthermore, from the relation $2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$, any integer $n$ is congruent to its remainder upon division by $2$. Thus, the integer $a-b$ must be congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $I$. This implies that the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/I$ has at most two distinct elements: the cosets represented by $0$ and $1$. To show that the ring has exactly two elements, we must verify that $1 \\not\\in I$, which is equivalent to showing that the cosets $0+I$ and $1+I$ are distinct. An element of $I$ can be written as $2(x+y\\sqrt{-5}) + (1+\\sqrt{-5})(u+v\\sqrt{-5})$ for some integers $x, y, u, v$. Expanding this expression, we get:\n$$(2x+u-5v) + (2y+u+v)\\sqrt{-5}$$\nFor this element to be equal to $1 = 1+0\\sqrt{-5}$, we would need to solve the system of linear equations:\n$$2x+u-5v = 1$$\n$$2y+u+v = 0$$\nFrom the second equation, $u = -2y-v$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:\n$$2x + (-2y-v) - 5v = 1$$\n$$2x - 2y - 6v = 1$$\n$$2(x-y-3v) = 1$$\nSince $x, y, v$ are integers, the term $(x-y-3v)$ must be an integer. However, there is no integer $k$ such that $2k=1$. This equation has no solution in the integers. Therefore, $1 \\notin I$, so $I$ is a proper ideal. Since the quotient ring contains at least two distinct elements ($0+I$ and $1+I$) and at most two elements, it must have exactly two elements. The quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/I$ is thus isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The norm of the ideal is the cardinality of this ring.\n$$N(I) = |\\mathcal{O}_K/I| = 2$$\n\nThird, we justify that the ideal $I$ is not principal. For an ideal to be principal, it must be generated by a single element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, denoted as $I = (\\alpha)$. A fundamental property relating ideal norms and field norms is that for a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$, its norm is given by $N((\\alpha)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$, where $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the field norm. For an element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, the field norm is calculated as:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = (a+b\\sqrt{-5})(a-b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 - (-5)b^2 = a^2+5b^2$$\nSince $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the value of $a^2+5b^2$ is always non-negative, so $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| = a^2+5b^2$. If $I$ were a principal ideal, say $I=(\\alpha)$, we would have $N(I) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$. From our previous computation, $N(I)=2$. This leads to the Diophantine equation:\n$$a^2+5b^2 = 2$$\nWe seek integer solutions $(a,b)$ for this equation.\n- If $b=0$, the equation becomes $a^2 = 2$. There is no integer $a$ whose square is $2$.\n- If $b \\neq 0$, then $b^2 \\ge 1$ (since $b$ is an integer). This implies $5b^2 \\ge 5$.\n- Consequently, for any non-zero integer $b$, we have $a^2+5b^2 \\ge 0 + 5b^2 \\ge 5$.\nSince $5 > 2$, there are no integer solutions for $(a,b)$ when $b \\neq 0$.\nCombining these cases, we conclude that the equation $a^2+5b^2 = 2$ has no solutions in integers $a, b$. This means there exists no element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| = 2$. This is a contradiction to the assumption that $I$ is a principal ideal with norm $2$. Therefore, the ideal $I = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$ cannot be generated by a single element and is not a principal ideal.

First, to derive a characterization for the order of an ideal class and show it is well-defined. Second, to compute the order of a specific ideal class in the ring of integers of $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Well-Definedness\n\nLet $K$ be a number field with its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The ideal class group is $\\mathrm{Cl}(K) = I_K / P_K$, where $I_K$ is the group of nonzero fractional ideals and $P_K$ is the subgroup of principal fractional ideals. The group operation is ideal multiplication.\n\nThe order of an ideal class $[I] \\in \\mathrm{Cl}(K)$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $[I]^n$ is the identity element in $\\mathrm{Cl}(K)$. The identity element is the class of principal fractional ideals, which we can denote as $[\\mathcal{O}_K]$ or simply $P_K$.\n\nBy the definition of the group operation in the quotient group $\\mathrm{Cl}(K)$, we have $[I]^n = [I^n]$. Therefore, the condition that $[I]^n$ is the identity element can be written as:\n$$[I^n] = [\\mathcal{O}_K]$$\nThis equality of classes holds if and only if the ideal $I^n$ is in the same class as $\\mathcal{O}_K$, which means $I^n$ must be a principal fractional ideal. So, the order of $[I]$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $I^n$ is a principal fractional ideal.\n\nThe problem statement asks to frame this in terms of an integral ideal representative $J$ of the class $[I]$. It is a standard result in algebraic number theory that every ideal class in $\\mathrm{Cl}(K)$ contains an integral ideal. Let $J \\subset \\mathcal{O}_K$ be a nonzero integral ideal such that $[J] = [I]$. The order of $[I]$ is then the same as the order of $[J]$. This is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $[J]^n$ is the identity class. As before, this is equivalent to $J^n$ being a principal fractional ideal.\nSince $J$ is an integral ideal (i.e., a subset of $\\mathcal{O}_K$), its power $J^n$ is also an integral ideal. An integral ideal is a principal fractional ideal if and only if it is a principal ideal in the usual sense, meaning it can be generated by a single element of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. That is, $J^n = (\\alpha)$ for some nonzero $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\nThus, we have derived the characterization: the order of a class $[I]$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that for any integral ideal representative $J$ of the class, $J^n$ is a principal ideal.\n\nNext, we must show that this integer $n$ is well-defined, i.e., it does not depend on the choice of the integral ideal $J$ representing the class.\nLet $J_1$ and $J_2$ be two nonzero integral ideals representing the same class, so $[J_1] = [J_2]$. By the definition of ideal class equivalence, this means there exists a nonzero element $\\gamma \\in K^\\times$ such that $J_2 = (\\gamma)J_1$, where $(\\gamma) = \\gamma\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the principal fractional ideal generated by $\\gamma$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer. We want to show that $J_1^n$ is principal if and only if $J_2^n$ is principal.\nSuppose $J_1^n$ is a principal ideal. Since $J_1$ is an integral ideal, $J_1^n$ is also an integral ideal, so $J_1^n = (\\alpha_1)$ for some $\\alpha_1 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\nNow consider $J_2^n$:\n$$J_2^n = ((\\gamma)J_1)^n = (\\gamma)^n J_1^n = (\\gamma^n) (\\alpha_1) = (\\gamma^n\\alpha_1)$$\nThe resulting ideal $(\\gamma^n\\alpha_1)$ is a principal fractional ideal generated by the element $\\gamma^n\\alpha_1 \\in K^\\times$. Therefore, if $J_1^n$ is principal, then $J_2^n$ is also a principal (fractional) ideal.\n\nConversely, suppose $J_2^n$ is principal. Since $J_1 = (\\gamma^{-1})J_2$, the same argument shows that $J_1^n = (\\gamma^{-n})J_2^n$ must also be principal.\nSo, for any given positive integer $n$, the property that the $n$-th power of an ideal is principal holds for one representative of a class if and only if it holds for all representatives of that class.\nConsequently, the set of positive integers $\\{m \\mid J^m \\text{ is principal}\\}$ is the same for all representatives $J$ of a given class. The smallest element of this set, which is the order of the class, is therefore well-defined and does not depend on the choice of representative.\n\nPart 2: Concrete Example\n\nWe are given $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, for which the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. We consider the integral ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (2,\\,1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The order of the class $[\\mathfrak{p}]$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}^n$ is a principal ideal.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\mathfrak{p}$ itself is not principal. We use the norm of an ideal. The norm of a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, is given by $N((\\alpha)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| = |(a+b\\sqrt{-5})(a-b\\sqrt{-5})| = a^2+5b^2$.\nThe norm of the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ is the size of the quotient ring, $N(\\mathfrak{p}) = |\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}| = |\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]/(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})|$. In the quotient ring, the generators are equivalent to $0$, so we have the relations $2 \\equiv 0$ and $1+\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv 0$. The second relation implies $\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv -1$.\nAny element $a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is congruent to $a+b(-1) = a-b \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}}$. Since $2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}}$, any integer is congruent to either $0$ or $1 \\pmod 2$. Thus, the distinct cosets are represented by $0$ and $1$. The quotient ring has $2$ elements, so $N(\\mathfrak{p}) = 2$.\nIf $\\mathfrak{p}$ were principal, say $\\mathfrak{p} = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5}$, then we would have $N(\\mathfrak{p}) = N((\\alpha))$, which implies $a^2+5b^2=2$.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $b$ must be an integer, so $b^2 \\ge 1$, which implies $5b^2 \\ge 5$. Since $a^2 \\ge 0$, we have $a^2+5b^2 \\ge 5$, so there is no solution with $b \\neq 0$.\nIf $b=0$, the equation becomes $a^2=2$. There is no integer $a$ satisfying this equation.\nTherefore, there is no element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ whose norm is $2$. This is a contradiction, so the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ is not principal. This shows that the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}]$ is greater than $1$.\n\nNext, we compute $\\mathfrak{p}^2$. Using the definition of ideal multiplication, we multiply the generating sets:\n$$\\mathfrak{p}^2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5}) = (2 \\cdot 2, 2(1+\\sqrt{-5}), (1+\\sqrt{-5})^2)$$\nLet's compute the generators:\n$2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n$2(1+\\sqrt{-5}) = 2+2\\sqrt{-5}$.\n$(1+\\sqrt{-5})^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(\\sqrt{-5}) + (\\sqrt{-5})^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{-5} - 5 = -4+2\\sqrt{-5}$.\nSo, $\\mathfrak{p}^2$ is the ideal generated by these three elements: $\\mathfrak{p}^2 = (4, 2+2\\sqrt{-5}, -4+2\\sqrt{-5})$.\nSince an ideal is closed under addition and subtraction, it contains any linear combination of its generators with coefficients in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Let's examine simple integer combinations first.\nThe ideal $\\mathfrak{p}^2$ contains $4$. It also contains $(2+2\\sqrt{-5}) - (-4+2\\sqrt{-5}) = 6$.\nSince $4 \\in \\mathfrak{p}^2$ and $6 \\in \\mathfrak{p}^2$, their difference $6-4=2$ must also be in $\\mathfrak{p}^2$.\nThis means that the principal ideal $(2)$ is a subset of $\\mathfrak{p}^2$, i.e., $(2) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{p}^2$.\nNow we check the reverse inclusion, $\\mathfrak{p}^2 \\subseteq (2)$. This requires showing that every generator of $\\mathfrak{p}^2$ is an element of the ideal $(2)$.\nThe ideal $(2)$ consists of all elements of the form $2\\beta$ for $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n- Generator $4$: $4 = 2 \\cdot 2$, so $4 \\in (2)$.\n- Generator $2+2\\sqrt{-5}$: $2+2\\sqrt{-5} = 2(1+\\sqrt{-5})$. Since $1+\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, this means $2+2\\sqrt{-5} \\in (2)$.\n- Generator $-4+2\\sqrt{-5}$: $-4+2\\sqrt{-5} = 2(-2+\\sqrt{-5})$. Since $-2+\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, this means $-4+2\\sqrt{-5} \\in (2)$.\nSince all generators of $\\mathfrak{p}^2$ are contained in $(2)$, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}^2$ itself must be contained in $(2)$, so $\\mathfrak{p}^2 \\subseteq (2)$.\nCombining both inclusions, we conclude that $\\mathfrak{p}^2 = (2)$.\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{p}^2 = (2)$, $\\mathfrak{p}^2$ is a principal ideal.\nThe order of the ideal class $[\\mathfrak{p}]$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}^n$ is principal.\nFor $n=1$, $\\mathfrak{p}^1 = \\mathfrak{p}$ is not principal.\nFor $n=2$, $\\mathfrak{p}^2 = (2)$ is principal.\nThe smallest such positive integer is $n=2$.
