No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is validated as a standard, well-posed question in algebraic number theory. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and self-contained. The instructions to \"determine the prime factorization\" and \"justify why no nontrivial factorization is possible\" are interpreted as a directive to prove that the integer $7$ is a prime element in the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nOur goal is to determine the prime factorization of the integer $7$ in the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i] = \\{a+bi \\mid a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain (UFD), an element is prime if and only if it is irreducible. We will investigate whether $7$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. An element is irreducible if it is not a unit and its only divisors are units and its associates (the element multiplied by a unit).\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $7$ has a non-trivial factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This means we can write $7 = \\alpha \\beta$, where $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are not units.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of the multiplicative norm, $N(z) = a^2+b^2$ for $z=a+bi$, and states that $N(\\alpha\\beta) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$. Applying the norm to our factorization of $7$:\n$$N(7) = N(\\alpha \\beta) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$$\nThe integer $7$ can be written as the Gaussian integer $7+0i$. Its norm is:\n$$N(7) = N(7+0i) = 7^2 + 0^2 = 49$$\nSo, the norms of the factors must satisfy the integer equation:\n$$N(\\alpha)N(\\beta) = 49$$\nThe units in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are given as $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm i\\}$. An element $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit if and only if its norm is $1$. For instance, $N(1) = 1^2+0^2=1$ and $N(i) = 0^2+1^2=1$.\nOur assumption is that the factorization is non-trivial, which means neither $\\alpha$ nor $\\beta$ is a unit. Therefore, their norms must be integers greater than $1$:\n$$N(\\alpha)  1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N(\\beta)  1$$\nThe integer $49$ has only one factorization into two integer factors greater than $1$, which is $7 \\times 7$. Thus, we must have:\n$$N(\\alpha) = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N(\\beta) = 7$$\nThis implies that for $7$ to have a non-trivial factorization, there must exist a Gaussian integer $\\alpha = a+bi$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) such that its norm is $7$. This is equivalent to finding integer solutions to the equation:\n$$a^2 + b^2 = 7$$\nThe problem specifies that we must use the congruence $7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ to analyze this possibility. Let us consider the equation $a^2+b^2=7$ modulo $4$.\nFor any integer $k$, its square $k^2$ can only have two possible values modulo $4$:\n- If $k$ is even, $k=2m$ for some integer $m$. Then $k^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n- If $k$ is odd, $k=2m+1$ for some integer $m$. Then $k^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 4m^2+4m+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nSo, any integer square is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$.\nNow, consider the sum of two squares, $a^2+b^2$, modulo $4$. The possible values are:\n- $0+0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$\n- $0+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$\n- $1+0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$\n- $1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$\nThis demonstrates that a sum of two integer squares can only be congruent to $0$, $1$, or $2$ modulo $4$.\n\nHowever, the right side of the equation $a^2+b^2=7$ is the integer $7$. As provided in the problem statement, $7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nSo, if a solution existed, we would have:\n$$a^2 + b^2 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 4$$\n$$a^2 + b^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$$\nThis is a contradiction, because the left side, $a^2+b^2$, can never be congruent to $3 \\pmod 4$.\nTherefore, the equation $a^2+b^2=7$ has no integer solutions for $a$ and $b$. This means there is no Gaussian integer $\\alpha$ with $N(\\alpha)=7$.\n\nThis result contradicts the necessary condition for a non-trivial factorization of $7$. Our initial assumption that $7$ can be factored into non-units must be false. The only possible factorizations of $7$ are trivial, of the form $7=u \\cdot \\gamma$, where $u$ is a unit and $\\gamma$ is an associate of $7$ (e.g., $7=1 \\cdot 7$, or $7=i \\cdot (-7i)$).\n\nThis proves that $7$ is an irreducible element in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a UFD, every irreducible element is also a prime element.\nThus, $7$ is a prime in the ring of Gaussian integers. Its prime factorization consists of a single prime factor, which is $7$ itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "3093757"}, {"introduction": "Having established that some rational primes remain inert in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, we now turn to those that split.

The ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain, so factorizations into Gaussian primes are unique up to order and associates.\n\nWe first factor $85$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$: $85=5\\cdot 17$. Both $5$ and $17$ are congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, so each splits as a product of two nonassociate Gaussian primes.

There are $4$ unit multiples of each of the $4$ representatives, for a total of $16$ distinct Gaussian integers.

A standard characterization (derivable from the multiplicativity of the norm and unique factorization) is that a nonunit $z=a+bi$ with $ab\\neq 0$ is a Gaussian prime if and only if $N(z)=a^{2}+b^{2}$ is a rational prime. If instead one of $a$ or $b$ is zero, then $z$ is a Gaussian prime if and only if $|a|$ or $|b|$ is a rational prime congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. In our situation, $N(z)=85$ is not a rational prime, and no solution to $a^{2}+b^{2}=85$ has $a=0$ or $b=0$ because $85$ is not a perfect square. Therefore, none of the $z$ with $N(z)=85$ is a Gaussian prime. Equivalently, each such $z$ has a nontrivial factorization $z\\sim \\pi_{5}^{\\epsilon}\\overline{\\pi_{5}}^{1-\\epsilon}\\cdot \\pi_{17}^{\\delta}\\overline{\\pi_{17}}^{1-\\delta}$ (for some $\\epsilon,\\delta\\in\\{0,1\\}$) into Gaussian primes, so all are composite in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nFinally, the number of distinct associate classes under multiplication by units among the $16$ elements is the number of unit-orbits of these elements. Each orbit under $U$ has size $4$ because none of the representatives has $a=0$ or $b=0$ or satisfies $|a|=|b|$ (which would induce stabilizers larger than the trivial one), and there are $16$ total elements. Hence the number of associate classes is $16/4=4$.\n\nThus, the final requested number of associate classes of Gaussian integers of norm $85$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3093739"}, {"introduction": "The property of unique factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a direct consequence of it being a Euclidean domain, which means we can perform division with remainder.
