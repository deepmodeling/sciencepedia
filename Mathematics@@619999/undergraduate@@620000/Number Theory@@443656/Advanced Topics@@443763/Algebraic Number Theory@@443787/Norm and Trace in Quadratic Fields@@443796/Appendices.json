Let $p(x) = x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + c_0$ be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $n$.

Is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{10})$?\n            *   Clearly $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{10})$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{10})$.\n            *   From $\\alpha = 7 + 2\\sqrt{10}$, we can write $2\\sqrt{10} = \\alpha - 7$, so $\\sqrt{10} = \\frac{\\alpha-7}{2}$. This means $\\sqrt{10} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n            *   Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{10}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n            *   So, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{10}) = K$.\n            *   This means the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n=2$, and $m=[K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)] = 1$.\n\n        *   Let's find the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = 7 + 2\\sqrt{10}$.\n            *   $x = 7 + 2\\sqrt{10}$\n            *   $x - 7 = 2\\sqrt{10}$\n            *   $(x - 7)^2 = (2\\sqrt{10})^2$\n            *   $x^2 - 14x + 49 = 4 \\cdot 10 = 40$\n            *   $x^2 - 14x + 9 = 0$.\n            *   The minimal polynomial is $p(x) = x^2 - 14x + 9$. This is a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients. Since $\\alpha$ is not rational (because $\\sqrt{10}$ is irrational), this polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n            *   Here, $n=2$, $c_1 = -14$, and $c_0 = 9$.\n\n        *   Now use the formulas for norm and trace based on the minimal polynomial.\n            *   $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = ((-1)^n c_0)^m = ((-1)^2 \\cdot 9)^1 = 9$.\n            *   $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = m(-c_{n-1}) = 1 \\cdot (-(-14)) = 14$.\n\n        *   Another definition of norm and trace for a Galois extension (which $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{10})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is) is using the embeddings. The embeddings of $K$ into an algebraic closure (like $\\mathbb{C}$) are $\\sigma_1$ (the identity) and $\\sigma_2$, where $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{10}) = -\\sqrt{10}$.\n            *   $\\sigma_1(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(7 + 2\\sqrt{10}) = 7 + 2\\sqrt{10}$\n            *   $\\sigma_2(\\alpha) = \\sigma_2(7 + 2\\sqrt{10}) = 7 - 2\\sqrt{10}$\n            *   Norm: $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha) \\cdot \\sigma_2(\\alpha) = (7 + 2\\sqrt{10})(7 - 2\\sqrt{10}) = 7^2 - (2\\sqrt{10})^2 = 49 - 4 \\cdot 10 = 49 - 40 = 9$.\n            *   Trace: $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha) + \\sigma_2(\\alpha) = (7 + 2\\sqrt{10}) + (7 - 2\\sqrt{10}) = 7 + 7 = 14$.\n\n        *   The problem asks to verify \"from first principles\". The first principle here is the definition of norm and trace as the determinant and trace of the multiplication map. The problem statement says: \"verify from first principles that these agree with the field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ and the field trace $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$\". This is slightly circular. The definition *is* that the norm and trace are the determinant and trace of the multiplication map. So, what it must mean is to compute the norm and trace using the *other* common definition (sum and product of Galois conjugates) and show they are equal. This seems to be the most sensible interpretation of the instruction.\n\n        *   **Verification:**\n            *   The determinant of the matrix $M_{\\alpha}$ is $\\det(M_{\\alpha}) = 9$.\n            *   The field norm computed via the product of conjugates is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = 9$.\n            *   These agree.\n            *   The trace of the matrix $M_{\\alpha}$ is $\\operatorname{tr}(M_{\\alpha}) = 14$.\n            *   The field trace computed via the sum of conjugates is $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = 14$.\n            *   These agree.\n\n        *   The phrasing \"verify from first principles that these agree with the field norm... and field trace\" is tricky. Let's re-read the problem statement carefully: \"compute the $2\\times 2$ matrix of $m_{\\alpha}$. Then compute its determinant and its trace, and verify from first principles that these agree with the field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ and the field trace $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$.\"\n        *   This implies that there's a definition of norm and trace *independent* of the matrix representation. The most fundamental definition of the norm and trace of an element $\\alpha$ in a finite extension $L/F$ is indeed the determinant and trace of the multiplication-by-$\\alpha$ map. The problem seems to be slightly ill-phrased, as it asks to verify a definition. A better phrasing might have been: \"Compute the determinant and trace of this matrix. Then, compute the field norm and trace using the definition based on Galois conjugates, and verify that the two sets of results are identical.\"\n        *   I will proceed under the assumption that this is the intended meaning. I will state that the primary definition of norm and trace is via the determinant and trace of the multiplication map, and then show that this is equivalent to the computation using the sum and product of conjugates.\n\n3.  **Construct the final solution text:**\n    *   Begin by stating the problem setup: the field $K$, the element $\\alpha$, the basis for $K$ as a $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space, and the linear map $m_{\\alpha}$.\n    *   **Step 1: Compute the matrix of $m_{\\alpha}$**\n        *   Explicitly compute $m_{\\alpha}(1)$ and write it in the basis $\\{1, \\sqrt{10}\\}$ to get the first column.\n        *   Explicitly compute $m_{\\alpha}(\\sqrt{10})$ and write it in the basis $\\{1, \\sqrt{10}\\}$ to get the second column.\n        *   Assemble the matrix.\n    *   **Step 2: Compute the determinant and trace**\n        *   Calculate the determinant of the matrix found in Step 1.\n        *   Calculate the trace of the matrix found in Step 1.\n    *   **Step 3: Verification**\n        *   State the definition of the field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ and field trace $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ as the determinant and trace of the multiplication map $m_{\\alpha}$.

We will proceed by following the specified tasks.\n\nFirst, we determine the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=-5$. The integer $d=-5$ is square-free. We check its congruence modulo $4$: $-5 = -8+3$, so $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. The problem provides the rule that for $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$. Therefore, for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. Elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are of the form $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSecond, we compute the absolute norms of the generators of the ideal $I$. The field norm of an element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in K$ is defined as $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\alpha'$, where $\\alpha' = a-b\\sqrt{-5}$ is the Galois conjugate of $\\alpha$.\nThus, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = (a+b\\sqrt{-5})(a-b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 - (b\\sqrt{-5})^2 = a^2+5b^2$.\nThe generators of $I$ are $2$ and $1+\\sqrt{-5}$.\nFor the generator $2$, which can be written as $2+0\\sqrt{-5}$:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2) = 2^2 + 5(0)^2 = 4$$\nThe absolute norm is $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)| = 4$.\nFor the generator $1+\\sqrt{-5}$:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1+\\sqrt{-5}) = 1^2 + 5(1)^2 = 1+5 = 6$$\nThe absolute norm is $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1+\\sqrt{-5})| = 6$.\n\nThird, we prove from first principles that the ideal $I=(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$ is not principal.\nLet us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $I$ is a principal ideal. This means there exists an element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $I=(\\alpha)$.\nIf $I=(\\alpha)$, then the generators $2$ and $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ must be multiples of $\\alpha$. That is, $\\alpha$ divides $2$ and $\\alpha$ divides $1+\\sqrt{-5}$.\nIn algebraic number theory, if $\\alpha|\\beta$, then $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ must divide $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)=4$ and $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ must divide $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1+\\sqrt{-5})=6$.\nSo, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ must be a common divisor of $4$ and $6$. The positive common divisors are $1$ and $2$.\nLet $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ for some integers $a, b$. Its norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)=a^2+5b^2$. We check the possible values for the norm.\nCase 1: $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = 1$. The equation $a^2+5b^2=1$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ has solutions only when $b=0$ and $a^2=1$, which gives $a=\\pm 1$. So $\\alpha = \\pm 1$. If $\\alpha=\\pm 1$, the ideal generated is $(\\pm 1) = \\mathcal{O}_K$. If $I = \\mathcal{O}_K$, then $1 \\in I$. This would mean there exist $x, y \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $1 = 2x + (1+\\sqrt{-5})y$. Let $x=a_1+b_1\\sqrt{-5}$ and $y=a_2+b_2\\sqrt{-5}$.\n$$1 = 2(a_1+b_1\\sqrt{-5}) + (1+\\sqrt{-5})(a_2+b_2\\sqrt{-5})$$\n$$1 = (2a_1 + a_2 - 5b_2) + (2b_1 + a_2 + b_2)\\sqrt{-5}$$\nEquating the rational and irrational parts, we get a system of linear equations for integers $a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2$:\n1) $2a_1 + a_2 - 5b_2 = 1$\n2) $2b_1 + a_2 + b_2 = 0 \\implies a_2 = -2b_1 - b_2$\nSubstituting (2) into (1): $2a_1 + (-2b_1-b_2) - 5b_2 = 1 \\implies 2a_1 - 2b_1 - 6b_2 = 1 \\implies 2(a_1-b_1-3b_2) = 1$.\nThis equation implies that $1$ is an even integer, which is a contradiction. Thus, $1 \\notin I$, so $I \\neq \\mathcal{O}_K$ and $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ cannot be $1$.\nCase 2: $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = 2$. The equation to solve is $a^2+5b^2=2$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=2$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $|b| \\ge 1$, which implies $b^2 \\ge 1$. Thus, $5b^2 \\ge 5$. Since $a^2 \\ge 0$, we have $a^2+5b^2 \\ge 5 > 2$. So there are no integer solutions for $a,b$.\nTherefore, there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ with norm $2$.\nSince neither of the possible norm values ($1$ or $2$) for a generator $\\alpha$ is achievable, our initial assumption that $I$ is principal must be false. Hence, $I$ is not a principal ideal.\n\nFourth, we compute the norm of the ideal $I$, denoted $N(I)$, by identifying the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/I$ and finding its cardinality, since $N(I) = [\\mathcal{O}_K:I] = |\\mathcal{O}_K/I|$.\nWe have $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ and $I=(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The quotient ring is $\\mathcal{O}_K/I = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] / (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$.\nIn this quotient ring, the generators of the ideal are equivalent to $0$.\n$1+\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I} \\implies \\sqrt{-5} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{I}$.\n$2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$.\nNow, consider an arbitrary element of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, say $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We can reduce this element modulo $I$:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv a+b(-1) \\pmod{I} \\equiv a-b \\pmod{I}$$\nThis shows that every element in $\\mathcal{O}_K/I$ is congruent to an integer modulo $I$. The set of elements in the quotient ring is $\\{ [k] \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$. However, we also have the relation $2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$, which means we can reduce these integers modulo $2$.\nAny integer $k$ is either even ($k=2m$) or odd ($k=2m+1$).\nIf $k$ is even, $k=2m \\equiv 2m \\equiv 0 \\cdot m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$.\nIf $k$ is odd, $k=2m+1 \\equiv 2m+1 \\equiv 0 \\cdot m + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{I}$.\nThis shows that any element $a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $I$.\nThe set of distinct cosets is $\\{[0], [1]\\}$. These are distinct because we already showed that $1 \\notin I$.\nThus, the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/I$ contains exactly two elements. This can be seen more formally by the ring isomorphism:\n$$\\mathcal{O}_K/I = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]/(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5}) \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+5)}{(2, 1+x)} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}[x]}{(x^2+5, 2, 1+x)}$$\nIn the quotient, $x \\equiv -1$. So we can replace $x$ with $-1$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{((-1)^2+5, 2)} = \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{(6, 2)} = \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{(\\text{gcd}(6,2))} = \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{(2)} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$$\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ has two elements. Therefore, the cardinality of the quotient ring is $2$.\nThe norm of the ideal $I$ is $N(I) = |\\mathcal{O}_K/I| = 2$.\n\nFinally, we compare $N(I)$ with the absolute norms of its generators.\nWe found $N(I)=2$, $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)|=4$, and $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1+\\sqrt{-5})|=6$.\nA general property of ideal norms is that the norm of an ideal $J$ divides the norm of any principal ideal $(j)$ where $j \\in J$. In our case, $I = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5}) = (2)\\mathcal{O}_K + (1+\\sqrt{-5})\\mathcal{O}_K$. The norm $N(I)$ must divide the norm of the ideal $(2)$ and the norm of the ideal $(1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The norm of a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$ is $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$. So, $N(I)$ must divide $N((2)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)|=4$ and $N(I)$ must divide $N((1+\\sqrt{-5})) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1+\\sqrt{-5})|=6$.\nTherefore, $N(I)$ must divide the greatest common divisor of these two norms:\n$$N(I) \\mid \\text{gcd}(|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)|, |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1+\\sqrt{-5})|)$$\nSubstituting the values, we have $2 \\mid \\text{gcd}(4,6)$, which is $2 \\mid 2$. This is true.\nIn this particular case, we observe a stronger relationship: equality.\n$$N(I) = 2 = \\text{gcd}(4,6)$$\n\nThe problem asks for submission of the single value of $N(I)$. Based on our calculation, this value is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3087693"}, {"introduction": "One of the most significant applications of the norm is in identifying and understanding the units of a ring of integers—its invertible elements.

We are asked to compute $\\alpha^2$ and then find the norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2)$ and trace $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2)$.\n\nThe definitions for the field norm and trace from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$ are based on the non-trivial field automorphism of $K$, which we denote by $\\sigma$. This automorphism is defined by its action on $\\sqrt{d}$, namely $\\sigma(\\sqrt{d}) = -\\sqrt{d}$. For any element $\\beta = a+b\\sqrt{d} \\in K$ (where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$), the automorphism acts as $\\sigma(\\beta) = \\sigma(a+b\\sqrt{d}) = a-b\\sqrt{d}$.\n\nThe field norm is defined as $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta)$.\nThe field trace is defined as $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) = \\beta + \\sigma(\\beta)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the explicit expression for $\\alpha^2$.\nGiven $\\alpha = x+y\\sqrt{d}$, we square this element:\n$$ \\alpha^2 = (x+y\\sqrt{d})^2 = x^2 + 2(x)(y\\sqrt{d}) + (y\\sqrt{d})^2 $$\n$$ \\alpha^2 = x^2 + 2xy\\sqrt{d} + y^2d $$\nGrouping the rational and irrational parts, we get the standard form for an element in $K$:\n$$ \\alpha^2 = (x^2+dy^2) + (2xy)\\sqrt{d} $$\nThis is the explicit expression for $\\alpha^2$.\n\nNext, we compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2)$. The norm is a multiplicative map, meaning $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta\\gamma) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma)$. This property follows directly from the definition: $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta\\gamma) = (\\beta\\gamma)\\sigma(\\beta\\gamma) = (\\beta\\gamma)(\\sigma(\\beta)\\sigma(\\gamma)) = (\\beta\\sigma(\\beta))(\\gamma\\sigma(\\gamma)) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma)$, since $\\sigma$ is a field automorphism.\nTherefore, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha \\cdot \\alpha) = (N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha))^2$.\n\nLet's compute $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\cdot \\sigma(\\alpha) = (x+y\\sqrt{d})(x-y\\sqrt{d}) = x^2 - (y\\sqrt{d})^2 = x^2-dy^2 $$\nThe problem states that $(x,y)$ is an integer solution to the equation $x^2-dy^2=-1$.\nThus, we have $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = -1$.\nNow we can compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2) = (N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha))^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 $$\nThis explains why $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2)$ must be $+1$. It is the square of the norm of $\\alpha$, which is specified to be $-1$ by the given Pell-type equation.\n\nFinally, we compute the trace of $\\alpha^2$, $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2)$.\nUsing the definition of the trace, $\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) = \\beta + \\sigma(\\beta)$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2$.\nWe have $\\alpha^2 = (x^2+dy^2) + (2xy)\\sqrt{d}$.\nWe need to find $\\sigma(\\alpha^2)$. Applying the automorphism $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma(\\alpha^2) = \\sigma((x^2+dy^2) + (2xy)\\sqrt{d}) = (x^2+dy^2) - (2xy)\\sqrt{d} $$\nNow, we sum $\\alpha^2$ and $\\sigma(\\alpha^2)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2) = [(x^2+dy^2) + (2xy)\\sqrt{d}] + [(x^2+dy^2) - (2xy)\\sqrt{d}] $$\nThe terms involving $\\sqrt{d}$ cancel out:\n$$ \\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha^2) = 2(x^2+dy^2) $$\nThis expression is in terms of the given integers $x$, $y$ and the parameter $d$.
