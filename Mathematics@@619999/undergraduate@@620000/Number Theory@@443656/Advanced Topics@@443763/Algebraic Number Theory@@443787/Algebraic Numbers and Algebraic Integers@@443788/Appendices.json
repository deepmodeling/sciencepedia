Do not round or approximate; express the polynomial exactly.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the algebraic nature of $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, culminating in the determination of its minimal polynomial and whether it is an algebraic integer.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ is an algebraic number over $\\mathbb{Q}$. According to the definition provided, a number is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if it is a root of some nonzero polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Let us construct such a polynomial.\nWe are given $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$. This can be manipulated into a polynomial equation:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n2\\alpha = 1 \\\\\n2\\alpha - 1 = 0\n$$\nThis shows that $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $P(x) = 2x - 1$. Since the coefficients of $P(x)$ are $2$ and $-1$, which are rational numbers, $P(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Therefore, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ is an algebraic number over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the monic minimal polynomial $m_{\\alpha}(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of $\\alpha$. The minimal polynomial is defined as the unique monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of the lowest possible degree that has $\\alpha$ as a root.\nThe polynomial we found, $P(x) = 2x - 1$, has $\\alpha$ as a root, but it is not monic because its leading coefficient is $2$, not $1$. To obtain a monic polynomial with the same root, we can divide $P(x)$ by its leading coefficient.\nLet us define a new polynomial:\n$$\nm_{\\alpha}(x) = \\frac{P(x)}{2} = \\frac{2x - 1}{2} = x - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis polynomial $m_{\\alpha}(x)$ has its coefficients, $1$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}$, in $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is monic by construction. It also has $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ as a root, since $m_{\\alpha}(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.\n\nWe must now justify that this is the minimal polynomial.\nThe degree of $m_{\\alpha}(x)$ is $\\deg(m_{\\alpha}) = 1$. A polynomial of degree $0$ is a non-zero constant $c \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which has no roots. Thus, the minimum possible degree for a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ having $\\alpha$ as a root is at least $1$. Since we have found a monic polynomial of degree $1$, this must be the minimal degree.\n\nFurthermore, a minimal polynomial must be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Any polynomial of degree $1$ over a field is, by definition, irreducible, as it cannot be factored into two polynomials of smaller, positive degree. Thus, $m_{\\alpha}(x) = x - \\frac{1}{2}$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, we address the uniqueness. The minimal polynomial is unique. Suppose there were another monic polynomial of minimal degree, say $q(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$, such that $q(\\alpha) = 0$. Since the minimal degree is $1$, $q(x)$ must also have degree $1$. As $q(x)$ is monic, it must be of the form $q(x) = x + b$ for some $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Since $q(\\alpha) = 0$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} + b = 0$, which implies $b = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $q(x) = x - \\frac{1}{2}$, which is identical to $m_{\\alpha}(x)$.\nTherefore, the monic minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is indeed $m_{\\alpha}(x) = x - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLastly, we determine whether $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer. An algebraic integer is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, i.e., in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. A fundamental result in algebraic number theory states that an algebraic number is an algebraic integer if and only if its monic minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has all its coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTo demonstrate this, let $\\beta$ be an algebraic integer. Then there is a monic $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $P(\\beta)=0$. The minimal polynomial $m_\\beta(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ must divide $P(x)$. By Gauss's lemma on polynomial factorization, if a monic integer polynomial factors into monic rational polynomials, those factors must also be integer polynomials. Hence, $m_\\beta(x)$ must be in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Conversely, if $m_\\beta(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, then $\\beta$ is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients by definition, so it is an algebraic integer.\n\nApplying this criterion to our number $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$:\nThe minimal polynomial is $m_{\\alpha}(x) = x - \\frac{1}{2}$. The coefficients of this polynomial are $1$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The coefficient $-\\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer. Since not all coefficients of $m_{\\alpha}(x)$ are integers, $m_{\\alpha}(x) \\notin \\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\nBased on the established\nrelationship, we conclude that $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ is not an algebraic integer.\n\nThe problem asks for the polynomial $m_{\\alpha}(x)$ as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x - \\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3080570"}, {"introduction": "A remarkable property of algebraic integers is that they form a ring; that is, the sum, difference, and product of any two algebraic integers are also algebraic integers. This exercise guides you through demonstrating a case of this principle for $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$.

We are tasked with finding the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, and determining the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\nFirst, we derive a polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $\\alpha$ is a root.\nLet $x = \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$.\nTo eliminate the radicals, we perform algebraic manipulations.\n$$x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{3}$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n$$(x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2$$\n$$x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3$$\nNext, we isolate the term containing the remaining radical, $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$x^2 - 1 = 2x\\sqrt{2}$$\nTo eliminate this last radical, we square both sides again:\n$$(x^2 - 1)^2 = (2x\\sqrt{2})^2$$\n$$x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 4x^2 \\cdot 2$$\n$$x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 8x^2$$\nRearranging the terms to form a polynomial equation gives:\n$$x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0$$\nLet $f(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$. This is a monic polynomial with rational coefficients (i.e., $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$) and $f(\\alpha) = 0$. The degree of this polynomial is $4$.\n\nNext, we must justify that $f(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A minimal polynomial of an algebraic number $\\alpha$ over a field $K$ is the unique monic polynomial of least degree in $K[x]$ having $\\alpha$ as a root. The degree of the minimal polynomial is equal to the degree of the field extension $[K(\\alpha):K]$. We will use the Tower Law to determine this degree.\n\nConsider the tower of field extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n\n1.  The extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$: The number $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$, or by noting that its roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $x^2 - 2$ is the minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the degree of the extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n\n2.  The extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$: This is the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ with the element $\\sqrt{3}$ adjoined. The number $\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 3$. The coefficients of this polynomial are in $\\mathbb{Q}$ and thus in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. To determine if this is the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we must check if $x^2 - 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is equivalent to checking if its roots, $\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Then there exist rational numbers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2}$. Squaring both sides yields $3 = (a + b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, $a^2+2b^2$ and $2ab$ are also in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Because $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, this equality can hold only if the coefficient of $\\sqrt{2}$ is zero. So, $2ab = 0$, which implies $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n    - If $b=0$, the equation becomes $3 = a^2$, which implies $a = \\pm\\sqrt{3}$, contradicting that $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    - If $a=0$, the equation becomes $3 = 2b^2$, which implies $b^2 = \\frac{3}{2}$, so $b = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$, contradicting that $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Since both cases lead to a contradiction, our assumption that $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is false. Therefore, the polynomial $x^2 - 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and is the minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The degree of the extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\n\nBy the Tower Law for field extensions:\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$$\n\nNow, we must show that the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})$ is the same as the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n-   Since $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$, and $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, their sum $\\alpha$ must also be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This implies $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n-   To show the reverse inclusion, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, we must demonstrate that $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ can be expressed as elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. Since $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, any rational function of $\\alpha$ with rational coefficients is also in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n    We have $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. Consider $\\alpha^{-1}$:\n    $$\\alpha^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}}{3 - 2} = \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}$$\n    Both $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha^{-1}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. We now have a system of two linear equations with $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ as variables:\n    $$\\begin{cases} \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\alpha \\\\ -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\alpha^{-1} \\end{cases}$$\n    Adding the two equations gives $2\\sqrt{3} = \\alpha + \\alpha^{-1}$, so $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha + \\alpha^{-1})$.\n    Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $2\\sqrt{2} = \\alpha - \\alpha^{-1}$, so $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha - \\alpha^{-1})$.\n    Since $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, $\\alpha^{-1}$ is also in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, and so are these linear combinations. Thus, $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. This implies that any element that can be constructed from $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{3}$ is contained in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n\nHaving shown both inclusions, we conclude that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nTherefore, the degree of the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is:\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 4$$\nThe degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be equal to this degree, which is $4$.\nWe found a monic polynomial $f(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$ of degree $4$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $f(\\alpha)=0$. Since its degree matches the degree of the minimal polynomial, $f(x)$ must be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A minimal polynomial is necessarily irreducible; if $f(x)$ were reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\alpha$ would be a root of one of its factors, which would have a degree less than $4$. This would contradict the fact that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe two results required are the minimal polynomial and the degree of the field extension.\nMinimal polynomial: $f(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$.\nDegree of the extension: $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^4 - 10x^2 + 1}\n$$", "id": "3080539"}, {"introduction": "For a number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer, it is natural to ask if the set of all integer polynomials in $\\alpha$, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$, constitutes the entire ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$.
