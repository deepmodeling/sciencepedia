No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in algebraic number theory, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clear task based on established mathematical definitions.\n\nThe absolute logarithmic Weil height $h(\\alpha)$ of an algebraic number $\\alpha$ belonging to a number field $K$ is defined via the places of $K$. Let $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = d$ be the degree of the field extension. Let $M_K$ be the set of places of $K$. For each place $v \\in M_K$, we associate a normalized absolute value $\\|\\cdot\\|_v$ and a local degree $d_v$. The set of places consists of archimedean (infinite) and non-archimedean (finite) places.\n\nThe standard normalizations are as follows:\n- For an archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a real embedding $\\sigma_i: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)|$ and the local degree is $d_v = [K_v:\\mathbb{Q}_\\infty] = [\\mathbb{R}:\\mathbb{R}] = 1$.\n- For an archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a pair of complex conjugate embeddings $\\sigma_i, \\bar{\\sigma}_i: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$, we have $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)|$ and the local degree is $d_v = [K_v:\\mathbb{Q}_\\infty] = [\\mathbb{C}:\\mathbb{R}] = 2$.\n- For a non-archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ lying over a rational prime $p$, we have $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = (N(\\mathfrak{p}))^{-\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha)}$, where $N(\\mathfrak{p})$ is the norm of the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ and $\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha)$ is the exponent of $\\mathfrak{p}$ in the prime ideal factorization of the fractional ideal $(\\alpha)$. The local degree is $d_v = [K_v: \\mathbb{Q}_p] = e_\\mathfrak{p}f_\\mathfrak{p}$, where $e_\\mathfrak{p}$ is the ramification index and $f_\\mathfrak{p}$ is the residue field degree of $\\mathfrak{p}$ over $p$.\n\nThe absolute logarithmic Weil height is then given by the formula:\n$$h(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{v \\in M_K} d_v \\log\\max(1, \\|\\alpha\\|_v)$$\nA key property of this definition is that the value of $h(\\alpha)$ is independent of the number field $K$ chosen to contain $\\alpha$. We will demonstrate this.\n\nFirst, we analyze the specified number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe degree of the extension is $d = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$.\nThe places of $K$ are:\n1.  **Archimedean places**: There are two real embeddings and no complex ones.\n    - $\\sigma_1: a+b\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto a+b\\sqrt{2}$. This defines a place $v_{\\infty,1}$ with local degree $d_{v_{\\infty,1}} = 1$.\n    - $\\sigma_2: a+b\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto a-b\\sqrt{2}$. This defines a place $v_{\\infty,2}$ with local degree $d_{v_{\\infty,2}} = 1$.\n    The sum of local degrees over the infinite place of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $1+1=2$, which equals $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n2.  **Non-archimedean places**: These correspond to prime ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The numbers we must evaluate, $2$, $3$, and $\\sqrt{2}$, are all algebraic integers. For any algebraic integer $\\alpha$ and any non-archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$, we have $\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha) \\ge 0$. This implies $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = (N(\\mathfrak{p}))^{-\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha)} \\le 1$. Consequently, $\\log\\max(1, \\|\\alpha\\|_v) = \\log(1) = 0$. Therefore, for algebraic integers, only the archimedean places contribute to the height calculation. We will still show the analysis for completeness.\n\nWe now compute the heights for the given numbers.\n\n**1. Computation of $h(2)$**\nThe number $\\alpha = 2$ is in $K$.\n- **Archimedean contribution**:\n    - For $v_{\\infty,1}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,1}} = |\\sigma_1(2)| = |2| = 2$. The term is $d_{v_{\\infty,1}} \\log\\max(1, 2) = 1 \\cdot \\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$.\n    - For $v_{\\infty,2}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,2}} = |\\sigma_2(2)| = |2| = 2$. The term is $d_{v_{\\infty,2}} \\log\\max(1, 2) = 1 \\cdot \\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$.\n    - The total archimedean contribution is $\\ln(2) + \\ln(2) = 2\\ln(2)$.\n- **Non-archimedean contribution**:\n    We only need to consider places lying over the prime $p=2$. The prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_K$: $(2) = (\\sqrt{2})^2$. Let $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\sqrt{2})$. Then $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)=2$. The valuation of $2$ at $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is $\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(2) = 2$. The corresponding absolute value is $\\|2\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2} = (N(\\mathfrak{p}_2))^{-\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(2)} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since $\\|2\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}  1$, the term $\\log\\max(1, \\|2\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}) = 0$. For all other finite places $v$, $\\|2\\|_v = 1$, so their contribution is also $0$. The total non-archimedean contribution is $0$.\n- **Total Height**:\n    $$h(2) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\ln(2) + 0) = \\ln(2)$$\n\n**2. Computation of $h(3)$**\nThe number $\\alpha = 3$ is in $K$.\n- **Archimedean contribution**:\n    - For $v_{\\infty,1}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,1}} = |\\sigma_1(3)| = |3| = 3$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(3) = \\ln(3)$.\n    - For $v_{\\infty,2}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,2}} = |\\sigma_2(3)| = |3| = 3$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(3) = \\ln(3)$.\n    - The total archimedean contribution is $\\ln(3) + \\ln(3) = 2\\ln(3)$.\n- **Non-archimedean contribution**:\n    We consider places over $p=3$. In $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the prime $3$ is inert because the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{2}{3}) = -1$. The ideal $(3)$ is prime in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, let's call it $\\mathfrak{p}_3$. $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3) = 3^2 = 9$. We have $\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_3}(3) = 1$. The absolute value is $\\|3\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_3} = 9^{-1} = \\frac{1}{9}$. Since this is less than $1$, the contribution to the height is $0$. All other finite places give $0$.\n- **Total Height**:\n    $$h(3) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\ln(3) + 0) = \\ln(3)$$\n\n**3. Computation of $h(\\sqrt{2})$**\nThe number $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$ is in $K$.\n- **Archimedean contribution**:\n    - For $v_{\\infty,1}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,1}} = |\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2})| = |\\sqrt{2}| = \\sqrt{2}$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$.\n    - For $v_{\\infty,2}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,2}} = |\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2})| = |-\\sqrt{2}| = \\sqrt{2}$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$.\n    - The total archimedean contribution is $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$.\n- **Non-archimedean contribution**:\n    The only non-zero valuation is at the place over $p=2$, which is $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\sqrt{2})$. We have $\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(\\sqrt{2}) = 1$. The absolute value is $\\|\\sqrt{2}\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2} = (N(\\mathfrak{p}_2))^{-1} = 2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since this is less than $1$, the contribution is $0$.\n- **Total Height**:\n    $$h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(2) + 0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$$\n\n**Verification of Consistency**\nWe verify these results using the alternative definition of height via the minimal polynomial. For an algebraic number $\\alpha$ with minimal polynomial $P(x) = a_d x^d + \\dots + a_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (with $\\text{gcd}(a_0, \\dots, a_d)=1$ and $a_d0$), the height is given by\n$$h(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{d} \\log M(P)$$\nwhere $M(P)$ is the Mahler measure of $P$, defined as $M(P) = |a_d| \\prod_{i=1}^d \\max(1, |\\alpha_i|)$, and $\\alpha_i$ are the roots of $P(x)$.\n\n- For $\\alpha = 2$: The number is rational, so we can view it in $K=\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(x) = x-2$. Here $d=1$, $a_1=1$, and the root is $\\alpha_1=2$.\n$M(P) = |1| \\cdot \\max(1, |2|) = 2$.\n$h(2) = \\frac{1}{1}\\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$. This matches our result.\n\n- For $\\alpha = 3$: The minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(x) = x-3$. Here $d=1$, $a_1=1$, and the root is $\\alpha_1=3$.\n$M(P) = |1| \\cdot \\max(1, |3|) = 3$.\n$h(3) = \\frac{1}{1}\\ln(3) = \\ln(3)$. This also matches.\n\n- For $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$: The minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(x) = x^2-2$. Here $d=2$, $a_2=1$. The roots are $\\alpha_1 = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\alpha_2 = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n$M(P) = |1| \\cdot \\max(1, |\\sqrt{2}|) \\cdot \\max(1, |-\\sqrt{2}|) = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2$.\n$h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(M(P)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$. This matches as well.\n\nThe calculations confirm that the absolute logarithmic Weil height is an intrinsic property of the algebraic number, independent of the field over which it is computed. The values are $h(2) = \\ln(2)$, $h(3)=\\ln(3)$, and $h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\ln(2)  \\ln(3)  \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3093643"}, {"introduction": "Roth's and Baker's theorems are two pillars of transcendental number theory, yet they address fundamentally different kinds of problems.

The qualitative descriptions of Roth's theorem and Baker's theorem are accurate. Roth's theorem (1955) states that for any algebraic irrational number $\\alpha$ and any $\\epsilon  0$, the inequality $\\left| \\alpha - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|  \\frac{1}{q^{2+\\epsilon}}$ has only finitely many solutions in integers $p$ and $q$ ($q \\ge 1$).

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation of options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to distinguish the domains of Roth's theorem and Baker's theorem.\n-   **Roth's Theorem**: Applies to expressions of the form $\\left| \\alpha - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$, where $\\alpha$ is an **algebraic irrational** number.\n-   **Baker's Theorem**: Applies to expressions of the form $|\\Lambda| = |b_1 \\log \\alpha_1 + \\cdots + b_n \\log \\alpha_n|$, where $b_i$ are integers and $\\alpha_i$ are **algebraic numbers**.\n\nWe need to find an option with two instances:\n1.  An expression of the form $\\left| \\alpha - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$ with $\\alpha$ being an algebraic irrational, which is not a linear form in logarithms.\n2.  An expression of the form $|\\Lambda|$ as defined above, which does not relate to the rational approximation of an algebraic number.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. First instance: For integers $p,q$ with $q \\ge 1$, consider $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$ as $q$ grows. Roth’s theorem applies because $\\sqrt{2}$ is an algebraic irrational, while Baker’s theorem does not directly apply because no logarithms of algebraic numbers appear. Second instance: For integers $x,y$, consider the nonzero quantity $\\left| x \\log 2 - y \\log 3 \\right|$. Baker’s theorem applies because this is a linear form in logarithms of algebraic numbers, while Roth’s theorem does not apply because this is not a rational approximation to an algebraic number.**\n\n-   **First Instance Analysis**: The expression is $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$. The number being approximated is $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 2 = 0$, it is an algebraic number. It is also irrational. Therefore, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an algebraic irrational. Roth's theorem directly concerns the inequality $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|  q^{-(2+\\epsilon)}$ and applies here. The expression $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$ is not in the form of a linear form in logarithms of algebraic numbers, so Baker's theorem does not directly apply. This part of the option is correct.\n\n-   **Second Instance Analysis**: The expression is $\\left| x \\log 2 - y \\log 3 \\right|$, where $x,y$ are integers. This can be written as $\\Lambda = x \\log 2 + (-y) \\log 3$. This is a linear form in logarithms with integer coefficients $b_1=x, b_2=-y$. The numbers involved are $\\alpha_1=2$ and $\\alpha_2=3$. Both $2$ (root of $z-2=0$) and $3$ (root of $z-3=0$) are algebraic numbers. As a consequence of Baker's theorems, $\\log 2$ and $\\log 3$ are linearly independent over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, so for any non-zero integer pair $(x,y)$, the form is non-zero. Baker's theorem provides a positive lower bound for this value. Thus, Baker's theorem applies. To see if Roth's theorem applies, we can rewrite the expression as $|\\log 2| \\cdot \\left| x - y \\frac{\\log 3}{\\log 2} \\right|$ or $|y| \\cdot \\left| \\frac{x}{y}\\log 2 - \\log 3 \\right|$. The most direct interpretation related to Roth's theorem would be to consider the rational approximation of the number $\\frac{\\log 3}{\\log 2}$ by the rational $\\frac{x}{y}$. Roth's theorem applies only if the number being approximated is algebraic. However, a result from Baker's theory itself is that any non-trivial linear form in logarithms of algebraic numbers with algebraic coefficients is transcendental. A special case shows that $\\frac{\\log 3}{\\log 2}$ is a transcendental number. Since it is not algebraic, Roth's theorem does not apply to its rational approximations. The justification that this problem does not concern a rational approximation to an *algebraic* number is correct.\n\n-   **Verdict**: Both instances and their justifications are correct. So, option A is **Correct**.\n\n**B. First instance: For integers $p,q$ with $q \\ge 1$, consider $\\left| \\log 2 - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$. Roth’s theorem applies because $\\log 2$ is irrational, whereas Baker’s theorem does not. Second instance: For integers $x,y$, consider $\\left| x \\log 2 - y \\log 4 \\right|$. Baker’s theorem guarantees a uniform positive lower bound for all nonzero integer pairs $(x,y)$.**\n\n-   **First Instance Analysis**: The expression is $\\left| \\log 2 - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$. Roth's theorem applies to the rational approximation of **algebraic** irrationals. By the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, $e^r$ is transcendental for any non-zero algebraic $r$. If $\\log 2$ were algebraic, then $e^{\\log 2} = 2$ would have to be transcendental, which is false. Thus, $\\log 2$ is a transcendental number. The claim that Roth's theorem applies is false.\n\n-   **Second Instance Analysis**: The expression is $\\left| x \\log 2 - y \\log 4 \\right|$. Since $\\log 4 = \\log(2^2) = 2 \\log 2$, the expression simplifies to $\\left| x \\log 2 - y (2 \\log 2) \\right| = \\left| (x - 2y) \\log 2 \\right|$. Baker's theorem applies to *non-zero* linear forms. If we choose a non-zero integer pair such as $(x,y) = (2,1)$, the form becomes $|(2 - 2(1))\\log 2| = 0$. The statement claims Baker's theorem provides a \"uniform positive lower bound for all nonzero integer pairs $(x,y)$\", which is false, as the form can be zero.\n\n-   **Verdict**: Both parts of this option are based on false premises. So, option B is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. First instance: For integers $p,q$ with $q \\ge 1$, consider $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$. Both Roth’s and Baker’s theorems apply directly here because $\\sqrt{2} = e^{\\log \\sqrt{2}}$. Second instance: For integers $x,y$, consider $\\left| x \\log 2 - y \\log 3 \\right|$. Roth’s theorem applies because $\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 3}$ can be treated as an algebraic irrational.**\n\n-   **First Instance Analysis**: The claim that Baker's theorem applies \"directly\" to $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$ is incorrect. The expression is not a linear form in logarithms. The reasoning \"because $\\sqrt{2} = e^{\\log \\sqrt{2}}$\" is a non-sequitur; one cannot simply rewrite an expression to force a theorem to apply to a different structure.\n\n-   **Second Instance Analysis**: The claim that Roth's theorem applies because \"$\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 3}$ can be treated as an algebraic irrational\" is false. As established in the analysis of option A, the number $\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 3}$ is transcendental.\n\n-   **Verdict**: Both parts of this option are based on false claims. So, option C is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. First instance: For integers $p,q$ with $q \\ge 1$, consider $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$. Roth’s theorem does not apply without additional assumptions on continued fractions. Second instance: For integers $x,y$, consider $\\left| x \\log 2 - y \\log e \\right|$. Baker’s theorem applies because $e$ is a well-known constant and logarithms are present.**\n\n-   **First Instance Analysis**: The statement that Roth's theorem \"does not apply without additional assumptions on continued fractions\" is false. Roth's theorem is a general result about Diophantine approximation of algebraic irrationals and requires no specific conditions related to continued fractions for its application. It applies directly to $\\left| \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right|$.\n\n-   **Second Instance Analysis**: The expression is $\\left| x \\log 2 - y \\log e \\right|$. Baker's theorem, as defined in the problem, applies to linear forms in logarithms of **algebraic** numbers. Here, the form involves $\\log 2$ and $\\log e$. While $2$ is an algebraic number, $e$ is a transcendental number (proven by Hermite in 1873). Therefore, Baker's theorem (on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers) does not apply to this expression. The justification given is vague and mathematically unsound. Note: Baker's theorem can be generalized, but in its standard form as described, it is not applicable here.\n\n-   **Verdict**: Both parts of this option are based on false claims. So, option D is **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies an instance where Roth's theorem applies but Baker's does not, and an instance where Baker's theorem applies but Roth's does not, with correct justifications for each.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3093660"}, {"introduction": "Roth's theorem makes a profound, yet non-constructive, claim: for any algebraic irrational $\\alpha$ and any $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$, there are only *finitely many* rational approximations $p/q$ satisfying the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q| \\lt q^{-2-\\varepsilon}$.

This follows from the definition of the nearest integer and basic properties of rounding and absolute value.\n\nRoth's theorem (a central result in Diophantine approximation) asserts that for an algebraic irrational $\\alpha$ and every $\\varepsilon  0$, the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q|  q^{-2-\\varepsilon}$ has only finitely many solutions in integers $p$ and $q \\ge 1$. This problem asks you to design and implement a computational test that, for concrete choices of $\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon$, and a search bound $Q \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$, scans all denominators $q$ with $1 \\le q \\le Q$ and counts how many denominators admit a rational approximation $p/q$ that violates the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q| \\ge q^{-2-\\varepsilon}$ (equivalently, satisfies $|\\alpha - p/q|  q^{-2-\\varepsilon}$). For each $q$, choose $p$ to be the nearest integer to $\\alpha q$ using the round-half-up convention: $p = \\lfloor \\alpha q + 1/2 \\rfloor$.\n\nYour task:\n- For each test case $(\\alpha, \\varepsilon, Q)$ below, compute the integer\n$$\nN(\\alpha,\\varepsilon,Q) = \\#\\{\\, q \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 1 \\le q \\le Q,\\ \\text{with}\\ \\exists p = \\lfloor \\alpha q + 1/2 \\rfloor\\ \\text{satisfying}\\ |\\alpha - p/q|  q^{-2-\\varepsilon} \\,\\}.\n$$\n- Note that minimizing $|\\alpha - p/q|$ over $p$ for a fixed $q$ is equivalent to minimizing $|\\alpha q - p|$, so you may compare the equivalent inequality $|\\alpha q - p|  q^{-1-\\varepsilon}$ to avoid a division by $q$.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameters, where each $\\alpha$ is a specific algebraic irrational given in closed form:\n1. $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.1$, $Q = 100000$.\n2. $\\alpha = \\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.05$, $Q = 100000$.\n3. $\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}$ (the unique real root of $x^3 - 2 = 0$), $\\varepsilon = 0.2$, $Q = 100000$.\n4. $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.001$, $Q = 20000$.\n5. $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.4$, $Q = 1$.\n\nYour program must output a single line containing a list of the five integers $[N_1,N_2,N_3,N_4,N_5]$ in this exact order, where $N_i = N(\\alpha_i,\\varepsilon_i,Q_i)$ for the $i$-th test case. The output must be a single line of the form $[n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4,n_5]$ with no spaces.\n\nNo physical units apply. Angles are not involved. All numerical comparisons and final counts must be exact with respect to the stated inequalities and rules. The final output format must be a single line containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[17,5,0,2,1]$).", "solution": "The problem asks us to perform a computational test based on Roth's theorem from Diophantine approximation. Specifically, for a given algebraic irrational number $\\alpha$, a positive real number $\\varepsilon$, and an integer search bound $Q$, we must count the number of integer denominators $q$ in the range $1 \\le q \\le Q$ that satisfy the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q|  q^{-2-\\varepsilon}$. The integer $p$ is uniquely determined for each $q$ as the nearest integer to the product $\\alpha q$.\n\nThe quantity to be computed is formally defined as:\n$$\nN(\\alpha,\\varepsilon,Q) = \\#\\{\\, q \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 1 \\le q \\le Q,\\ \\text{with}\\ p = \\lfloor \\alpha q + 1/2 \\rfloor\\ \\text{satisfying}\\ |\\alpha - p/q|  q^{-2-\\varepsilon} \\,\\}\n$$\nThe rule $p = \\lfloor \\alpha q + 1/2 \\rfloor$ corresponds to the standard round-half-up convention for finding the nearest integer.\n\nFor computational purposes, it is advantageous to manipulate the inequality to avoid divisions and potential floating-point inaccuracies. Multiplying the inequality by $q$ (which is positive) yields an equivalent form:\n$$\n|\\alpha q - p|  q^{-1-\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThis form is numerically more stable as it avoids the division by $q$ when calculating the error and also avoids having to compute $q$ raised to a negative power close to $-2$, which can be very small.\n\nThe algorithm to calculate $N(\\alpha, \\varepsilon, Q)$ for a given test case is as follows:\n\n1.  Initialize a counter for the number of solutions, say `count`, to $0$.\n2.  Iterate through all integer denominators $q$ from $1$ to $Q$.\n3.  For each value of $q$:\n    a. Calculate the corresponding numerator $p$ using the specified rounding rule: $p = \\lfloor \\alpha q + 0.5 \\rfloor$.\n    b. Calculate the left-hand side (LHS) of the transformed inequality: $\\text{LHS} = |\\alpha q - p|$.\n    c. Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the transformed inequality: $\\text{RHS} = q^{-(1+\\varepsilon)}$.\n    d. Compare the two sides. If $\\text{LHS}  \\text{RHS}$, it means the condition is satisfied for the current $q$. In this case, increment `count`.\n4.  After the loop completes, the final value of `count` is the result $N(\\alpha, \\varepsilon, Q)$.\n\nThis process can be implemented efficiently using vectorized operations, for instance with the NumPy library. An array of all integers $q$ from $1$ to $Q$ can be created. Then, the corresponding arrays for $p$, the LHS, and the RHS can be computed in single vectorized steps. Finally, a vectorized comparison and sum can yield the total count.\n\nA crucial aspect of the implementation is numerical precision. For some test cases, particularly those involving numbers that are \"very irrational\" like the golden ratio $\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, the quantity $|\\alpha q - p|$ can become extremely small for large $q$. Standard double-precision floating-point numbers (`float64`) may not have sufficient precision to represent the product $\\alpha q$ accurately enough, leading to catastrophic cancellation when $p$ is subtracted. This can result in an incorrect value for the LHS and a wrong evaluation of the inequality. To ensure correctness, higher-precision floating-point types, such as `numpy.longdouble`, are necessary for these sensitive calculations.\n\nThe algorithm is applied to each of the five test cases:\n1.  $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.1$, $Q = 100000$.\n2.  $\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.05$, $Q = 100000$.\n3.  $\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.2$, $Q = 100000$.\n4.  $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.001$, $Q = 20000$.\n5.  $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.4$, $Q = 1$.\n\nThe final output is a list of the five integer counts $[N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4, N_5]$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_violations(alpha, epsilon, Q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of denominators q in [1, Q] for which the inequality\n    |alpha - p/q|  q**(-2-epsilon) holds, where p is the nearest integer to alpha*q.\n    This is equivalent to |alpha*q - p|  q**(-1-epsilon).\n\n    Args:\n        alpha (float): The algebraic irrational number.\n        epsilon (float): The epsilon parameter from Roth's theorem.\n        Q (int): The upper bound for the denominator q.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of denominators q that satisfy the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Use extended precision (long double) for calculations to avoid catastrophic\n    # cancellation and precision loss, which can occur with standard float64 for\n    # certain alpha values (like the golden ratio) and large q.\n    alpha_ld = np.longdouble(alpha)\n    epsilon_ld = np.longdouble(epsilon)\n    \n    # Create an array of all denominators q from 1 to Q.\n    # We use int64 for q to be safe, then cast to longdouble for calculations.\n    q_vals = np.arange(1, Q + 1, dtype=np.int64)\n    q_vals_ld = q_vals.astype(np.longdouble)\n\n    # For each q, find the nearest integer p to alpha*q using the round-half-up rule:\n    # p = floor(alpha*q + 0.5)\n    # The calculation is vectorized for efficiency.\n    p_vals = np.floor(alpha_ld * q_vals_ld + np.longdouble(0.5))\n\n    # Calculate the left-hand side of the inequality |alpha*q - p|.\n    lhs = np.abs(alpha_ld * q_vals_ld - p_vals)\n    \n    # Calculate the right-hand side of the inequality q**(-1-epsilon).\n    rhs = q_vals_ld**(-np.longdouble(1.0) - epsilon_ld)\n    \n    # Count how many q values satisfy the inequality lhs  rhs.\n    count = np.sum(lhs  rhs)\n    \n    # The result is an integer count.\n    return int(count)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for the given test suite of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (alpha, epsilon, Q).\n    test_cases = [\n        (np.sqrt(2), 0.1, 100000),                      # Case 1\n        ((1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2.0, 0.05, 100000),      # Case 2\n        (np.cbrt(2), 0.2, 100000),                      # Case 3\n        (np.sqrt(3), 0.001, 20000),                     # Case 4\n        (np.sqrt(2), 0.4, 1)                           # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for alpha, epsilon, Q in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the number of violations for the current test case.\n        result = count_violations(alpha, epsilon, Q)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Format the final output as a single-line comma-separated list in brackets,\n    # with no spaces, as required by the problem statement.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\n# Execute the solution.\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "3093613"}]}
