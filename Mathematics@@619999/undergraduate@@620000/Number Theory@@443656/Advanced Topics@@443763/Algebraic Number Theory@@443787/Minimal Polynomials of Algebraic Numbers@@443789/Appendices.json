An algebraic number over a field $\\mathbb{K}$ is a number that serves as a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{K}$. The minimal polynomial of an algebraic number $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{K}$ is the unique monic polynomial of least positive degree in $\\mathbb{K}[x]$ that has $\\alpha$ as a root. A fundamental property of the minimal polynomial is that it must be irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{K}$.\n\nThe given condition is $\\alpha^{3} = 2$. This can be rearranged into the polynomial equation $\\alpha^{3} - 2 = 0$. This suggests that $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$. Let us examine this candidate polynomial.\n\nThe polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$ has coefficients $1$ and $-2$, both of which are elements of the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, the leading coefficient is $1$, which means $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial. By its construction, $p(\\alpha) = \\alpha^{3} - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$, so $\\alpha$ is indeed a root of $p(x)$.\n\nTo establish that $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we must demonstrate that it is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. If it were reducible, it would have to be the product of polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients. Since $p(x)$ has degree $3$, if it were reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it must have a linear factor of the form $(x - c)$ where $c$ is a rational root. Therefore, proving that $p(x)$ has no rational roots is sufficient to prove its irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that we must use the Rational Root Test to justify this part of the argument. The Rational Root Test states that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, $a_n x^n + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$, any rational root $\\frac{r}{s}$ (in lowest terms) must satisfy the conditions that $r$ divides the constant term $a_0$ and $s$ divides the leading coefficient $a_n$.\n\nFor our polynomial, $p(x) = x^3 - 2$, the coefficients are integers. The leading coefficient is $a_3 = 1$, and the constant term is $a_0 = -2$.\nAccording to the Rational Root Test, any potential rational root $\\frac{r}{s}$ must have:\n- $r$ as a divisor of $a_0 = -2$. The integer divisors of $-2$ are $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$.\n- $s$ as a divisor of $a_3 = 1$. The integer divisors of $1$ are $\\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n\nThus, the set of all possible rational roots for $p(x)$ is given by the set of fractions $\\frac{r}{s}$, which is $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$. We now test each of these candidates by direct substitution into $p(x)$:\n- For $x = 1$: $p(1) = (1)^{3} - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1 \\neq 0$.\n- For $x = -1$: $p(-1) = (-1)^{3} - 2 = -1 - 2 = -3 \\neq 0$.\n- For $x = 2$: $p(2) = (2)^{3} - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \\neq 0$.\n- For $x = -2$: $p(-2) = (-2)^{3} - 2 = -8 - 2 = -10 \\neq 0$.\n\nSince none of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the polynomial, we conclude that $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$. As $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$, its lack of roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$ implies that it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe have now established three key properties for the polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 2$:\n1. It is a monic polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2. It has $\\alpha$ as a root, i.e., $p(\\alpha)=0$.\n3. It is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThese are precisely the defining properties of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.

Let $x$ represent the number $\\alpha$.\n$$x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{8}$$\nFollowing the instruction to isolate a single radical, we move $\\sqrt{2}$ to the left side of the equation:\n$$x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{8}$$\nNow, we square both sides to eliminate the radical on the right:\n$$(x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{8})^2$$\nExpanding the left side and simplifying the right side gives:\n$$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$$\n$$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 2 = 8$$\nNext, we isolate the term containing the remaining radical, $2\\sqrt{2}x$:\n$$x^2 - 6 = 2\\sqrt{2}x$$\nTo eliminate the last radical, we square both sides of the equation again:\n$$(x^2 - 6)^2 = (2\\sqrt{2}x)^2$$\nExpanding both sides yields:\n$$(x^2)^2 - 2(x^2)(6) + 6^2 = 2^2(\\sqrt{2})^2 x^2$$\n$$x^4 - 12x^2 + 36 = 4(2)x^2$$\n$$x^4 - 12x^2 + 36 = 8x^2$$\nFinally, we rearrange the terms to form a monic polynomial equation with rational coefficients:\n$$x^4 - 12x^2 - 8x^2 + 36 = 0$$\n$$x^4 - 20x^2 + 36 = 0$$\nThus, we have derived a monic polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - 20x^2 + 36$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $P(\\alpha) = 0$.\n\nThe next step is to factor $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ to find the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$. The minimal polynomial, $m_{\\alpha}(x)$, must be an irreducible factor of any polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $\\alpha$ is a root.\nThe polynomial $P(x)$ is a biquadratic polynomial. We can factor it by setting $y = x^2$:\n$$y^2 - 20y + 36 = 0$$\nWe seek two numbers that multiply to $36$ and sum to $-20$. These numbers are $-2$ and $-18$. So, the quadratic in $y$ factors as:\n$$(y - 2)(y - 18) = 0$$\nSubstituting $x^2$ back for $y$, we obtain the factorization of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$P(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 18)$$\nThe two factors are $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^2 - 18$. Both are polynomials in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. We must check if they are irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A quadratic polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it has no rational roots.\n- The roots of $x^2 - 2 = 0$ are $x = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational.

It is monic.\n2.  **In $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$:** The coefficients $1$, $0$, and $-18$ are all rational numbers.\n3.  **Root:** We have just shown that $\\alpha$ is a root of $x^2 - 18$.\n4.  **Irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$:** We have already established its irreducibility.\n5.  **Least Degree:** The degree of $x^2 - 18$ is $2$. If a polynomial of degree $1$, say $x-q$ where $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, had $\\alpha$ as a root, then $\\alpha$ would have to be equal to $q$, which means $\\alpha$ would be rational.

The solution involves two main parts: first, determining the degree of the minimal polynomial, and second, deriving a monic polynomial of that degree which has $\\alpha$ as a root.\n\nFirst, we will establish the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is by definition the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$. We will use fundamental principles of field theory, namely the Tower Law for field extensions. The number $\\alpha$ is an element of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$, which is the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt[3]{2}$. Thus, the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ generated by $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$.\n\nLet us determine the degree of the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $m_{\\sqrt{2}}(x) = x^2 - 2$. This polynomial is monic, has rational coefficients, has $\\sqrt{2}$ as a root, and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Therefore, the degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(m_{\\sqrt{2}}(x)) = 2$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $m_{\\sqrt[3]{2}}(x) = x^3 - 2$. This polynomial is monic, has rational coefficients, has $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ as a root, and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$.

The polynomial $x^3 - 2$ has $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ as a root. We must check if it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A cubic polynomial is reducible over a field if and only if it has a root in that field. Let us assume it has a root $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSubstituting this into the polynomial gives $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^3 = 2$.\nExpanding the left side yields $a^3 + 3a^2b\\sqrt{2} + 3a(b\\sqrt{2})^2 + (b\\sqrt{2})^3 = 2$, which simplifies to $(a^3+6ab^2) + (3a^2b+2b^3)\\sqrt{2} = 2$.\nSince $1$ and $\\sqrt{2}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we can equate the rational and irrational parts:\n$a^3 + 6ab^2 = 2$\n$3a^2b + 2b^3 = 0$\nThe second equation can be factored as $b(3a^2+2b^2) = 0$. This implies either $b=0$ or $3a^2+2b^2=0$.\nIf $b=0$, the first equation becomes $a^3=2$, which has no solution for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $3a^2+2b^2=0$, since $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the only solution is $a=0$ and $b=0$.

This shows that $\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nFurthermore, since $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, it follows that $\\sqrt[3]{2} = \\alpha - \\sqrt{2}$ is also an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nThis demonstrates that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nCombining both inclusions, we have established the equality $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2})$.\nTherefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ is:\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 6$.\nThis justifies from first principles why the degree of the minimal polynomial is $6$.\n\nNext, we derive the explicit form of the minimal polynomial, which we now know must be a monic polynomial of degree $6$. Let this polynomial be $p(x)$. We start from the equation derived earlier connecting $x$ and $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^3 + 6x - 2 = \\sqrt{2}(3x^2 + 2)$\nTo eliminate the radical $\\sqrt{2}$, we square both sides:\n$(x^3 + 6x - 2)^2 = 2(3x^2 + 2)^2$\nExpanding the left side:\n$(x^3)^2 + 2(x^3)(6x-2) + (6x-2)^2 = x^6 + 12x^4 - 4x^3 + 36x^2 - 24x + 4$.\nExpanding the right side:\n$2(9x^4 + 12x^2 + 4) = 18x^4 + 24x^2 + 8$.\nEquating the two expressions and collecting terms on one side yields:\n$x^6 + 12x^4 - 4x^3 + 36x^2 - 24x + 4 - (18x^4 + 24x^2 + 8) = 0$\n$x^6 + (12-18)x^4 - 4x^3 + (36-24)x^2 - 24x + (4-8) = 0$\n$x^6 - 6x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 24x - 4 = 0$\nWe have found a monic polynomial $p(x) = x^6 - 6x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 24x - 4$ with rational coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root.
