Under the hypothesis $d \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the constant term is not an integer.\n\nTo conclude that $\\alpha$ is not integral, we use the minimal polynomial argument. The element $\\alpha$ is not rational because $\\sqrt{d} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$ for squarefree $d \\neq 1$, so the degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $2$, and the above quadratic is the monic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of smallest degree satisfied by $\\alpha$; hence it is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If $\\alpha$ were integral, then by the definition of algebraic integers there would exist a monic polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $f(\\alpha) = 0$.

Conclude by determining the class number $h_{K}$ of $K$. Give your final answer as the single integer $h_{K}$.", "solution": "First, we identify the properties of the field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$. This is a quadratic number field of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=-5$. Since $d$ is square-free and $d=-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers of $K$ is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. Elements of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ are of the form $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ for integers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe degree of the extension is $n=[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the signature $(r_{1}, r_{2})$ of $K$.\nThe embeddings of $K$ into the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ are determined by the roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{-5}$, which is $x^2+5=0$. The roots are $\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{-5}) = i\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{-5}) = -i\\sqrt{5}$. Since both roots are non-real, there are no real embeddings, so $r_1=0$. There is one pair of complex conjugate embeddings, so $r_2=1$. The signature is thus $(r_1, r_2) = (0, 1)$. We can verify that $n = r_1 + 2r_2 = 0 + 2(1) = 2$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the discriminant $D_{K}$ of $K$.\nFor a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ square-free, the discriminant $D_K$ is given by $d$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $4d$ if $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$.

Using $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$ and $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23607$:\n$$M_{K} \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 2.23607}{3.14159} \\approx \\frac{8.94428}{3.14159} \\approx 2.847$$\nMinkowski's theorem guarantees that every ideal class in the class group of $K$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with norm $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\leq M_K$. Since $M_K \\approx 2.847$, we need to examine prime ideals whose norm is a prime number $p \\leq M_K$. The only such prime is $p=2$.\n\nStep 4: Analyze ideals with norm bounded by $M_K$.\nThe class group $\\text{Cl}(K)$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm less than or equal to $M_K$.\nThe only integral ideal with norm $1$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K = (1)$, which is the principal ideal representing the identity element of the class group.\nWe must investigate ideals of norm $2$. These must be prime ideals lying above the rational prime $p=2$. We use the Dedekind-Kummer theorem to factor the ideal $(2)\\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, we consider the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{-5}$, which is $f(x) = x^2+5$, and reduce it modulo $2$:\n$$x^2+5 \\equiv x^2+1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod{2}$$\nSince the polynomial factors into a repeated linear factor, the prime $2$ is ramified in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The factorization of the ideal $(2)$ is $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2$, where $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a prime ideal given by $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The norm of this ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = \\sqrt{N((2))} = \\sqrt{2^2} = 2$.\n\nStep 5: Determine if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is principal and find the class number $h_K$.\nThe class group is generated by the ideal class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. To determine the structure of the class group, we must test if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a principal ideal. If $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ were principal, there would exist an element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$. The norm of such an element must equal the norm of the ideal:\n$$N(\\alpha) = N(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 - (-5)b^2 = a^2+5b^2$$\nWe would require $N(\\alpha) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 2$. So we must check if the Diophantine equation $a^2+5b^2=2$ has integer solutions for $a$ and $b$.\nIf $b=0$, we have $a^2=2$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $|b| \\geq 1$, which implies $b^2 \\geq 1$. In this case, $5b^2 \\geq 5$. Since $a^2 \\geq 0$, we have $a^2+5b^2 \\geq 5 > 2$.\nThus, there are no integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the equation $a^2+5b^2=2$. This demonstrates that there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$. Consequently, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ cannot be principal.\nThis means its class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is a non-trivial element of the class group. Therefore, the class number $h_K > 1$.\n\nThe class group is generated by $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. We now find the order of this element. Consider the ideal class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2]$. From the factorization of $(2)$, we have $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2)$. The ideal $(2)$ is a principal ideal generated by the integer $2$. Therefore, its class is the identity element in the class group:\n$$[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [(2)] = [1]$$\nThis shows that the element $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ has order $2$. Since the class group is generated by an element of order $2$, the group itself must be a cyclic group of order $2$. The elements of the class group are $[(1)]$ (the class of principal ideals) and $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\nThe class number $h_K$ is the order of the class group. Therefore, $h_K=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3080401"}]}
