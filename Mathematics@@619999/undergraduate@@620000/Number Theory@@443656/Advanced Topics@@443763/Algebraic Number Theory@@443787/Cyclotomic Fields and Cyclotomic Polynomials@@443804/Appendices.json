We shall proceed by following the enumerated tasks.\n\nThe definitions provided are:\nAn $n$th root of unity is a complex number $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $z^n = 1$.\nThe order of a complex number $z$ is the least positive integer $m$ such that $z^m = 1$.\nA primitive $n$th root of unity is an $n$th root of unity whose order is exactly $n$.\nThe $n$th cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_n(x)$ is the unique monic polynomial whose roots are the primitive $n$th roots of unity.\n\n1. Identification of primitive roots of unity for $n=1$, $n=2$, and $n=3$.\n\nFor $n=1$: The set of $1$st roots of unity are the solutions to $z^1 = 1$, which is the singleton set $\\{1\\}$. The order of $z=1$ is the least positive integer $m$ such that $1^m=1$, which is clearly $m=1$. Therefore, the set of primitive $1$st roots of unity is $\\{1\\}$.\n\nFor $n=2$: The set of $2$nd roots of unity are the solutions to $z^2 = 1$, which is the set $\\{1, -1\\}$. We must check the order of each element. The order of $1$ is $1$. For $z=-1$, we have $(-1)^1 = -1 \\neq 1$ and $(-1)^2=1$. Thus, the least positive integer $m$ for which $(-1)^m=1$ is $m=2$. The order of $-1$ is $2$. Therefore, the set of primitive $2$nd roots of unity is $\\{-1\\}$.\n\nFor $n=3$: The set of $3$rd roots of unity are the solutions to $z^3 = 1$. These are given by $z_k = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i k}{3}\\right)$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe root for $k=0$ is $z_0 = \\exp(0) = 1$. Its order is $1$.\nThe root for $k=1$ is $z_1 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right)$. Its powers are $(z_1)^1 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right) \\neq 1$, $(z_1)^2 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right) \\neq 1$, and $(z_1)^3 = \\exp(2\\pi i) = 1$. The order is $3$.\nThe root for $k=2$ is $z_2 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right)$. Its powers are $(z_2)^1 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right) \\neq 1$, $(z_2)^2 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{8\\pi i}{3}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right) \\neq 1$, and $(z_2)^3 = \\exp(4\\pi i) = 1$. The order is $3$.\nTherefore, the set of primitive $3$rd roots of unity is $\\left\\{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right), \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right)\\right\\}$.\n\n2. Derivation of the polynomials $\\Phi_{1}(x)$, $\\Phi_{2}(x)$, and $\\Phi_{3}(x)$.\n\n$\\Phi_1(x)$ is the monic polynomial whose root is the primitive $1$st root of unity, which is $1$. Thus, $\\Phi_1(x) = x - 1$.\n$\\Phi_2(x)$ is the monic polynomial whose root is the primitive $2$nd root of unity, which is $-1$. Thus, $\\Phi_2(x) = x - (-1) = x+1$.\n$\\Phi_3(x)$ is the monic polynomial whose roots are the primitive $3$rd roots of unity, $\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right)$ and $\\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right)$.\n$$ \\Phi_3(x) = \\left(x - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right)\\right)\\left(x - \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right)\\right) $$\nExpanding this, we get:\n$$ \\Phi_3(x) = x^2 - \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right)\\right)x + \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe sum of the roots is $\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = -1$.\nThe product of the roots is $\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{3} + \\frac{4\\pi i}{3}\\right) = \\exp(2\\pi i) = 1$.\nSubstituting these values, we find $\\Phi_3(x) = x^2 - (-1)x + 1 = x^2 + x + 1$.\n\n3. Determination of a closed-form expression for $\\Phi_6(x)$.\n\nThe roots of the polynomial $x^n-1$ are the $n$th roots of unity. Each $n$th root of unity is a primitive $d$th root of unity for exactly one positive integer $d$ that divides $n$. This means the set of $n$th roots of unity is the disjoint union of the sets of primitive $d$th roots of unity for all $d|n$. Since $\\Phi_d(x)$ is the polynomial whose roots are the primitive $d$th roots of unity, we can write the factorization:\n$$ x^n - 1 = \\prod_{d|n} \\Phi_d(x) $$\nFor $n=6$, the positive divisors are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$ x^6 - 1 = \\Phi_1(x) \\Phi_2(x) \\Phi_3(x) \\Phi_6(x) $$\nWe can determine $\\Phi_6(x)$ by isolating it from this equation:\n$$ \\Phi_6(x) = \\frac{x^6 - 1}{\\Phi_1(x) \\Phi_2(x) \\Phi_3(x)} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by recognizing products of cyclotomic polynomials. We know that $x^3-1 = \\prod_{d|3}\\Phi_d(x) = \\Phi_1(x)\\Phi_3(x)$. Also, $x^6-1$ can be factored as a difference of squares: $x^6 - 1 = (x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1)$.\nSubstituting these into the relation for $x^6-1$:\n$$ (x^3-1)(x^3+1) = \\Phi_1(x) \\Phi_2(x) \\Phi_3(x) \\Phi_6(x) $$\n$$ (\\Phi_1(x)\\Phi_3(x))(x^3+1) = \\Phi_1(x) \\Phi_2(x) \\Phi_3(x) \\Phi_6(x) $$\nAssuming $x$ is not a root of $\\Phi_1(x)$ or $\\Phi_3(x)$, we can cancel these terms, which is valid for polynomial identities:\n$$ x^3+1 = \\Phi_2(x) \\Phi_6(x) $$\nThis gives a much simpler path to find $\\Phi_6(x)$:\n$$ \\Phi_6(x) = \\frac{x^3+1}{\\Phi_2(x)} $$\nSubstituting $\\Phi_2(x) = x+1$ and using the sum of cubes factorization $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$:\n$$ \\Phi_6(x) = \\frac{(x+1)(x^2 - x + 1)}{x+1} $$\nFor $x \\neq -1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Phi_6(x) = x^2 - x + 1 $$\nSince cyclotomic polynomials are by definition polynomials, this identity must hold for all $x$.

Let $\\zeta$ be a primitive $18$-th root of unity, so $\\zeta^{18}=1$ and its order is 18. Consider $t=\\zeta^{3}$. Since $\\zeta$ has order $18$, the element $t$ has order $18/\\gcd(18,3)=18/3=6$, so $t$ is a primitive $6$-th root of unity. Primitive $6$-th roots of unity satisfy the quadratic $t^{2}-t+1=0$, because $t=\\exp(\\pm i\\pi/3)$, and the minimal polynomial of $\\exp(i\\pi/3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $t^{2}-t+1$. Therefore\n$$\n\\zeta^{6}-\\zeta^{3}+1=t^{2}-t+1=0,\n$$\nso $\\zeta$ is a root of $x^{6}-x^{3}+1$. Conversely, suppose $x$ satisfies $x^{6}-x^{3}+1=0$. Let $t=x^{3}$, then $t^{2}-t+1=0$, which forces $t$ to be a primitive $6$-th root of unity. The multiplicative order of $t$ is $6$. If the multiplicative order of $x$ were $m$, then the order of $x^{3}$ would be $m/\\gcd(m,3)$, which must equal $6$. We analyze the possibilities for $m$. If $m$ is not divisible by 3, then $\\gcd(m,3)=1$, which implies $m=6$. However, if the order of $x$ is 6, the order of $x^3$ is $6/\\gcd(6,3)=2$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $m$ must be divisible by 3. Let $m=3k$ for some integer $k$. Then the order of $x^3$ is $3k/\\gcd(3k,3) = 3k/3 = k$. Setting $k=6$ gives $m=18$. The order of $x^3$ would then be $18/\\gcd(18,3) = 18/3 = 6$, which is consistent. Thus $m=18$, so $x$ is a primitive $18$-th root of unity. Hence the roots of $x^{6}-x^{3}+1$ are exactly the primitive $18$-th roots of unity, as required.\n\nSecond, check degree. The polynomial $x^{6}-x^{3}+1$ is of degree $6$. Euler’s totient function satisfies\n$$\n\\varphi(18)=18\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=18\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{2}{3}=6,\n$$\nso $\\deg \\Phi_{18}(x)=\\varphi(18)$ as expected. Equivalently, the degree can be read directly from the Möbius product formula:\n$$\n\\deg \\Phi_{18}(x)=\\sum_{d|18}\\mu(18/d)\\cdot d=3-6-9+18=6.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the computed polynomial $x^{6}-x^{3}+1$ satisfies both the root and degree properties of the $18$-th cyclotomic polynomial, confirming the result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x^{6}-x^{3}+1}$$", "id": "3083939"}, {"introduction": "Cyclotomic polynomials are not just abstract algebraic objects; their values at integer inputs have significant number-theoretic properties, notably in the study of prime factors of numbers of the form $a^n-1$.

Let $\\zeta$ be a variable representing a root of unity. The polynomial $x^n - 1$ has as its roots all $n$-th roots of unity.

Substituting back $y=x^{3}$:\n$$\\Phi_{9}(x) = (x^{3})^{2} + x^{3} + 1 = x^{6} + x^{3} + 1$$\nNow we can compute the value of $\\Phi_{9}(2)$ by substituting $x=2$:\n$$\\Phi_{9}(2) = 2^{6} + 2^{3} + 1 = 64 + 8 + 1 = 73$$\n\nThe second task is to verify the factorization property for $n=9$ and $x=2$.
