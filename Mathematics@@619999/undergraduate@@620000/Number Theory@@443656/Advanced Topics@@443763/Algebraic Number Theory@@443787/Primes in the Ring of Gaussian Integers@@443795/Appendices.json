It provides the necessary definitions and properties of the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, and asks for the factorization of the rational integers $3$ and $5$ within this ring. All statements are factually correct and the problem is well-posed.\n\nTo determine whether a rational integer is a Gaussian prime, we analyze its reducibility in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. An element $\\pi \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is reducible if it can be written as a product $\\pi = xy$ where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are non-units. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm i\\}$, which are precisely the elements with norm $1$. Thus, $x$ and $y$ are non-units if $N(x)  1$ and $N(y)  1$.\n\nLet $p$ be a rational prime. If $p$ is reducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, we can write $p = xy$ for non-units $x,y$. Applying the multiplicative property of the norm, we have $N(p) = N(x)N(y)$. The norm of $p$ as an element of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is $N(p+0i) = p^2+0^2 = p^2$. So, $p^2 = N(x)N(y)$. Since $N(x)$ and $N(y)$ are integers greater than $1$, the only possibility is $N(x) = p$ and $N(y) = p$.\nThis implies that a rational prime $p$ is reducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ if and only if there exists a Gaussian integer $\\alpha = a+bi$ such that $N(\\alpha) = p$, which is equivalent to $a^2+b^2=p$. If no such integers $a, b$ exist, then $p$ cannot be factored into non-units and is therefore a Gaussian prime.\n\nThe problem prompts us to consider the sum of two squares modulo $4$. For any integer $n$, its square $n^2$ must be congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$:\n- If $n$ is even, $n=2k$ for some $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, so $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$ for some $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, so $n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nConsequently, a sum of two squares, $a^2+b^2$, can only be congruent to $0+0=0$, $0+1=1$, or $1+1=2$ modulo $4$. A number congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ can never be expressed as the sum of two squares.\n\nAnalysis of the rational integer $3$:\nThe integer $3$ is a rational prime. We examine its value modulo $4$: $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Based on the argument above, $3$ cannot be written as the sum of two integer squares. This means there is no Gaussian integer $\\alpha = a+bi$ such that $N(\\alpha) = a^2+b^2 = 3$. As established earlier, this is the necessary and sufficient condition for the rational prime $3$ to be irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Therefore, $3$ is a Gaussian prime. Its factorization into Gaussian primes is simply $3$.\n\nAnalysis of the rational integer $5$:\nThe integer $5$ is a rational prime. We examine its value modulo $4$: $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This does not preclude it from being a sum of two squares. Indeed, we can find by inspection that $5 = 2^2+1^2$.\nThe problem states that if $p = a^2+b^2$, then $p=(a+bi)(a-bi)$. For $p=5$, with $a=2$ and $b=1$, we get the factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$:\n$$5 = (2+i)(2-i)$$\nWe must verify that these factors, $2+i$ and $2-i$, are themselves Gaussian primes. Let's consider $\\pi_1 = 2+i$. Its norm is $N(2+i) = 2^2+1^2 = 5$. If $2+i$ were reducible, say $2+i=xy$ for non-units $x,y$, then $N(2+i)=N(x)N(y)$, which means $5=N(x)N(y)$. Since $N(x), N(y)$ are integers greater than $1$, this is impossible as $5$ is a rational prime. Therefore, any Gaussian integer whose norm is a rational prime must be a Gaussian prime. Both $N(2+i)=5$ and $N(2-i)=2^2+(-1)^2=5$ are rational primes, so $2+i$ and $2-i$ are Gaussian primes.\nThe factorization of $5$ into Gaussian primes is thus $(2+i)(2-i)$.\n\nThe problem imposes a canonical choice for the factors of $5$. The representation of a prime as a sum of two squares is unique up to ordering and signs. For $5$, we have $5=2^2+1^2$ and $5=1^2+2^2$. These lead to two pairs of conjugate factors: $\\{2+i, 2-i\\}$ and $\\{1+2i, 1-2i\\}$. Note that these pairs are associates: $1+2i = i(2-i)$ and $1-2i = (-i)(2+i)$. The convention given is to choose the factor $a+bi$ such that $a0$, $b0$, and $ab$.\n- For the factor $2+i$: $a=2, b=1$. We have $20$, $10$, and $21$. This factor satisfies the condition.\n- For the factor $1+2i$: $a=1, b=2$. We have $10$, $20$, but $1 \\not 2$. This factor does not satisfy the condition.\nThe canonical choice of factor is therefore $2+i$. The problem asks for the factorization of $5$, which is the product of this canonical factor and its conjugate. Thus, the canonical factorization of $5$ is $(2+i)(2-i)$.\n\nThe final answer requires a matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}F_{3}  F_{5}\\end{pmatrix}$, where $F_3$ is the factorization of $3$ and $F_5$ is the factorization of $5$.\n$F_3 = 3$\n$F_5 = (2+i)(2-i)$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3  (2+i)(2-i) \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "3088543"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the relationship between an element and its norm is crucial, but it can also be subtle.

An element $\\delta \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit if and only if its norm $N(\\delta)=1$. Since $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are non-units, we must have $N(\\beta)  1$ and $N(\\gamma)  1$.\n\nTaking the norm of the equation $p=\\beta\\gamma$ and using the multiplicative property of the norm, we have:\n$$N(p) = N(\\beta\\gamma) = N(\\beta)N(\\gamma)$$\nThe norm of $p$ is $N(p+0i) = p^{2}+0^{2} = p^{2}$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$p^{2} = N(\\beta)N(\\gamma)$$\nSince $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are Gaussian integers, their norms $N(\\beta)$ and $N(\\gamma)$ are non-negative integers. As we have established that $N(\\beta)1$ and $N(\\gamma)1$, and given that $p$ is a rational prime, the only way to factor the integer $p^{2}$ into two integers greater than $1$ is as $p \\times p$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$N(\\beta) = p \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N(\\gamma) = p$$\nLet $\\beta = a+bi$ for some integers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The condition $N(\\beta) = p$ translates to:\n$$a^{2} + b^{2} = p$$\nThis equation states that the prime $p$ can be expressed as the sum of two integer squares. However, a well-known result in number theory (provable by considering squares modulo 4) states that a prime number $p$ can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if $p \\neq 3 \\pmod 4$. Since we are given $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, no such integers $a$ and $b$ exist.\n\nThis is a contradiction.

Since no such element exists, the factorization $p^{2}=N(\\beta)N(\\gamma)$ with $N(\\beta)=p$ is impossible. This invalidates our initial assumption that $p$ is reducible. Therefore, any rational prime $p$ with $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ is an irreducible element in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nThe second task is to find the smallest positive axis element of this type to serve as our counterexample, $\\alpha$, and compute its norm.\nThe elements we seek are irreducibles $\\alpha$ for which $N(\\alpha)$ is composite. We have just shown that if we take $\\alpha=p$ where $p$ is a rational prime and $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, then $\\alpha$ is irreducible. The norm of this $\\alpha$ is $N(p) = p^{2}$. Since $p$ is a prime, $p \\ge 3$, so $p^{2}$ is a composite integer. Thus, any such $p$ provides a counterexample.\n\nWe are asked to select the axis element with the smallest positive absolute value. The axis elements of this type are of the form $p$ or $pi$ (and their negatives), where $p$ is a rational prime satisfying $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. The absolute value of $\\alpha = p$ is $|p| = p$, and the absolute value of $\\alpha = pi$ is $|pi| = |p||i| = p$. To find the smallest positive absolute value, we need to find the smallest positive rational prime $p$ such that $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe sequence of rational primes is $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \\ldots$.\n- $2 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n- $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n- $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n- $7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\nThe smallest such prime is $p=3$.\n\nThe axis elements with the smallest positive absolute value ($3$) are $3, -3, 3i, -3i$.
