The problem must first be validated for scientific soundness and consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$: $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$.\n- Rational point $P$: $(2, 1)$.\n- First task: Verify that the inverse of $P$, denoted $-P$, is the point $(2, -1)$ using the geometric group law.\n- Second task: Compute $2P$ (which is notation for $P+P$) by constructing the tangent line to $E$ at $P$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is well-defined and scientifically grounded in the mathematical field of number theory and algebraic geometry.\n1.  The equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$ defines a non-singular cubic curve, which is a valid elliptic curve over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  The point $P=(2, 1)$ must be verified to lie on the curve. Substituting the coordinates into the equation gives $1^2 = 2^3 - 4(2) + 1$, which simplifies to $1 = 8 - 8 + 1$, or $1=1$. The point $P$ is indeed on the curve $E$.\n3.  The tasks—verifying the inverse and calculating the sum of a point with itself—are standard operations under the well-defined geometric group law on an elliptic curve.\n4.  The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information. It does not violate any mathematical principles and is free of ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe group of rational points on an elliptic curve $E$, denoted $E(\\mathbb{Q})$, is an abelian group with the group operation defined geometrically. The identity element is the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. The sum of three collinear points $P_1, P_2, P_3$ on the curve is the identity, i.e., $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\n**Part 1: Verification of the Inverse**\nThe inverse of a point $P = (x_p, y_p)$ is the point $-P$ such that $P + (-P) = \\mathcal{O}$. Geometrically, $-P$ is the third point of intersection of the line passing through $P$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ with the curve. A line passing through a finite point $P=(x_p, y_p)$ and the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ is a vertical line with the equation $x=x_p$.\nFor the curve $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$, substituting $x=x_p$ gives $y^2 = x_p^3 - 4x_p + 1$, which yields two solutions for $y$, namely $y = \\pm\\sqrt{x_p^3 - 4x_p + 1}$. These two solutions correspond to two points of intersection: $(x_p, y_p)$ and $(x_p, -y_p)$.\nTherefore, the line passing through $P=(x_p, y_p)$ and $(x_p, -y_p)$ is the vertical line $x=x_p$, which intersects the curve at $P$, $(x_p, -y_p)$, and $\\mathcal{O}$. According to the group law, this implies $P + (x_p, -y_p) + \\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}$, which simplifies to $P + (x_p, -y_p) = \\mathcal{O}$. Thus, by definition of the inverse, $-P = (x_p, -y_p)$.\nGiven $P=(2, 1)$, its inverse is $-P = (2, -1)$. This verifies the first part of the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $2P$**\nTo compute $2P = P+P$, we follow the chord-and-tangent method. Since the two points being added are the same, we use the tangent line to the curve at $P$.\nThe equation of the curve is $F(x,y) = y^2 - x^3 + 4x - 1 = 0$. We find the slope of the tangent line at $P=(2,1)$ using implicit differentiation with respect to $x$:\n$$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} - 3x^2 + 4 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 - 4}{2y}$$\nAt the point $P=(2, 1)$, the slope $m$ is:\n$$m = \\frac{3(2)^2 - 4}{2(1)} = \\frac{3(4) - 4}{2} = \\frac{12 - 4}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$$\nThe equation of the tangent line at $P$ is given by $y - y_p = m(x - x_p)$:\n$$y - 1 = 4(x - 2)$$\n$$y = 4x - 8 + 1$$\n$$y = 4x - 7$$\nNext, we find the third intersection point of this tangent line with the curve $E$. We substitute the expression for $y$ from the line equation into the curve equation:\n$$(4x - 7)^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$$\n$$16x^2 - 56x + 49 = x^3 - 4x + 1$$\n$$0 = x^3 - 16x^2 + 52x - 48$$\nWe know that since the line is tangent at $P=(2, 1)$, the $x$-coordinate $x=2$ must be a root of this cubic polynomial with multiplicity at least $2$. Thus, $(x-2)^2$ is a factor of $x^3 - 16x^2 + 52x - 48$.\nLet the three roots of the cubic be $x_1, x_2, x_3$. From Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -(-16)/1 = 16$.\nWe know two of the roots are the $x$-coordinate of $P$, so $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 2$. Let the third intersection point be $R=(x_R, y_R)$. Then,\n$$2 + 2 + x_R = 16$$\n$$x_R = 12$$\nTo find the $y$-coordinate $y_R$, we substitute $x_R=12$ into the equation of the line (as it is computationally simpler):\n$$y_R = 4(12) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41$$\nSo, the third point of intersection is $R=(12, 41)$.\nAccording to the group law, the sum of the collinear points $P$, $P$, and $R$ is the identity:\n$$P + P + R = \\mathcal{O}$$\n$$2P + R = \\mathcal{O}$$\nThis implies that $2P$ is the inverse of $R$.\n$$2P = -R$$\nUsing the rule for the inverse derived in the first part, $-R = (x_R, -y_R)$.\nTherefore, the coordinates of $2P$ are $(12, -41)$.\nThe final answer is the pair of coordinates for the point $2P$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12 & -41 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3090189"}, {"introduction": "The conjecture's other side involves the Hasse-Weil $L$-function, an analytic object built from local data.

For all good primes $p \\neq 11$, $c_p=1$.\n\n**2) Computation of $a_p$**\n\nWe must compute $a_p = p+1 - \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for $p \\in \\{2,3,5,7\\}$.\n$p=2$: $y^2+y \\equiv x^3-x^2 \\pmod 2$. The LHS $y(y+1)$ is always $0 \\pmod 2$. The RHS $x^2(x-1)$ is also always $0 \\pmod 2$. So for each of the $2$ values of $x$, there are $2$ values of $y$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ affine points. Including the point at infinity, $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_2)=5$. Thus, $a_2 = 2+1-5 = -2$.\n$p=3$: $y^2+y \\equiv x^3-x^2-x-2 \\pmod 3$. For an equation $y^2+y-k \\equiv 0$, the number of solutions depends on the discriminant $1+4k$.\nFor $x=0$, $y^2+y-1 \\equiv 0$. $D = 1-4(-1)=5\\equiv 2$ (non-residue), 0 solutions.\nFor $x=1$, $y^2+y \\equiv 0$, so $y=0,2$. 2 solutions.\nFor $x=2$, $y^2+y \\equiv 0$, so $y=0,2$. 2 solutions.\nTotal affine points: $0+2+2=4$. $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3)=5$. So $a_3=3+1-5=-1$.\n$p=5$: $y^2+y \\equiv x^3-x^2 \\pmod 5$.\nFor $x=0, y^2+y \\equiv 0$, so $y=0,4$. 2 solutions.\nFor $x=1, y^2+y \\equiv 0$, so $y=0,4$. 2 solutions.\nFor $x=2, y^2+y-4 \\equiv 0$. $D = 1-4(-4)=17\\equiv 2$ (non-residue), 0 solutions.\nFor $x=3, y^2+y-3 \\equiv 0$. $D = 1-4(-3)=13\\equiv 3$ (non-residue), 0 solutions.\nFor $x=4, y^2+y-3 \\equiv 0$. $D = 1-4(-3)=13\\equiv 3$ (non-residue), 0 solutions.\nTotal affine points: $2+2+0+0+0=4$. $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_5)=5$. So $a_5=5+1-5=1$.\n$p=7$: $y^2+y \\equiv x^3-x^2-3x+1 \\pmod 7$. We check the discriminant $1+4f(x)$ where $f(x)=x^3-x^2-3x+1$. QRs are $\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n$x=0, f(0)=1 \\implies 1+4f(0)=5$ (QNR): 0 solutions.\n$x=1, f(1)=-2 \\equiv 5 \\implies 1+4f(1)=21 \\equiv 0$: 1 solution.\n$x=2, f(2)=8-4-6+1=-1 \\equiv 6 \\implies 1+4f(2)=25 \\equiv 4$ (QR): 2 solutions.\n$x=3, f(3)=27-9-9+1=10 \\equiv 3 \\implies 1+4f(3)=13 \\equiv 6$ (QNR): 0 solutions.\n$x=4, f(4)=64-16-12+1=37 \\equiv 2 \\implies 1+4f(4)=9 \\equiv 2$ (QR): 2 solutions.\n$x=5, f(5)=125-25-15+1=86 \\equiv 2 \\implies 1+4f(5)=9 \\equiv 2$ (QR): 2 solutions.\n$x=6, f(6) \\equiv (-1)^3-(-1)^2-3(-1)+1=-1-1+3+1=2 \\implies 1+4f(6)=9 \\equiv 2$ (QR): 2 solutions.\nTotal affine points: $0+1+2+0+2+2+2=9$. Hence, $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7)=10$. So $a_7=7+1-10=-2$.\n\n**3) Torsion Subgroup**\n\nLet $T=E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ be the torsion subgroup, and let $N=|T|$. A standard theorem states that for a prime $p$ of good reduction, the reduction map $\\rho_p: T \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is injective for torsion points whose order is prime to $p$.\nThe map $\\rho_3: T \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_3)$ has a kernel that is a 3-group. As $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3)=5$, the order $N$ must divide 5, so any torsion point has order prime to 3. Therefore, the map is injective, and $N$ must divide $5$. This implies $N \\in \\{1, 5\\}$.\nTo distinguish between these possibilities, we check for a rational point of order 5. Consider the integer point $P=(5,5)$.\n$y^2+y = 5^2+5=30$.\n$x^3-x^2-10x-20 = 5^3-5^2-10(5)-20 = 125-25-50-20=30$.\nThe point $P=(5,5)$ is on the curve. We compute its order. The inverse is $-P=(x, -y-a_1x-a_3) = (5, -5-1) = (5,-6)$.\nThe tangent slope at $P=(5,5)$ is $\\lambda = \\frac{3x^2+2a_2x+a_4-a_1y}{2y+a_1x+a_3} = \\frac{3(5^2)+2(-1)(5)-10}{2(5)+1} = \\frac{75-10-10}{11}=5$.\n$x(2P) = \\lambda^2 - a_2 - 2x_P = 5^2 - (-1) - 2(5) = 25+1-10=16$.\n$y(2P) = \\lambda(x_P-x(2P)) - y_P - a_3 = 5(5-16)-5-1 = -55-6 = -61$. So $2P=(16,-61)$.\nThe inverse of $2P=(16,-61)$ is $-2P=(16,-(-61)-1)=(16,60)$.\nTo compute $3P = P+2P$, the line connecting $P(5,5)$ and $2P(16,-61)$ has slope $\\lambda' = \\frac{-61-5}{16-5} = \\frac{-66}{11}=-6$.\n$x(3P) = (\\lambda')^2-a_2 - (x_P+x_{2P}) = (-6)^2 - (-1) - (5+16) = 36+1-21=16$.\n$y(3P) = \\lambda'(x_P-x(3P)) - y_P - a_3 = -6(5-16)-5-1 = -6(-11)-6 = 60$. So $3P=(16,60)$.\nWe see that $3P=-2P$, which implies $5P=\\mathcal{O}$ (the point at infinity).\nThe point $(5,5)$ has order $5$. The torsion subgroup contains a cyclic subgroup of order $5$. Since we already know $N$ must be $1$ or $5$, we conclude that $\\#E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}=5$.\n\n**4) Real Néron Period $\\Omega_E$**\n\nThe Néron differential for the given minimal model is $\\omega = \\frac{dx}{2y+a_1x+a_3} = \\frac{dx}{2y+1}$.\nThe real locus $E(\\mathbb{R})$ consists of points $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfying the curve equation. Completing the square for $y$ gives $(y+1/2)^2 = x^3-x^2-10x-19.75$. For points to exist, we need $g(x) = x^3-x^2-10x-19.75 \\ge 0$. The discriminant of the cubic $g(x)$ is negative, so $g(x)$ has only one real root, say $\\alpha$. Thus, the real locus $E(\\mathbb{R})$ consists of a single connected component for $x \\ge \\alpha$.\nThe real Néron period $\\Omega_E$ is the integral of the absolute value of the Néron differential over the identity component of $E(\\mathbb{R})$.\n$$ \\Omega_E = \\int_{E(\\mathbb{R})} |\\omega| = \\int_{E(\\mathbb{R})} \\left| \\frac{dx}{2y+1} \\right| $$\nExplicitly, this period is given by the integral:\n$$ \\Omega_E = \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{4x^3 - 4x^2 - 40x - 79}} $$\nwhere the cubic under the square root comes from $4(y+1/2)^2 = 4x^3 - 4x^2 - 40x - 79$. The expression is equivalent to the one involving $-19.75$.\n\n**5) BSD Prediction**\n\nThe Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture gives a formula for the leading term of the $L$-function $L(E,s)$ at $s=1$:\n$$ \\lim_{s\\to 1} \\frac{L(E,s)}{(s-1)^r} = \\frac{\\Omega_E R_E |\\Sha(E/\\mathbb{Q})| \\prod_p c_p}{|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|^2} $$\nWe are given:\n- The analytic rank is $r=0$.\n- The regulator for rank $0$ is $R_E=1$.\n- The Shafarevich–Tate group is trivial, so $|\\Sha(E/\\mathbb{Q})|=1$.\nWe have computed:\n- The product of Tamagawa numbers is $\\prod_p c_p = c_{11} = 5$.\n- The size of the torsion subgroup is $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}| = 5$.\nSubstituting these values into the BSD formula for $r=0$:\n$$ L(E,1) = \\frac{\\Omega_E \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5}{5^2} = \\frac{5\\Omega_E}{25} = \\frac{\\Omega_E}{5} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\Omega_E}{5}}$$", "id": "3090311"}]}
