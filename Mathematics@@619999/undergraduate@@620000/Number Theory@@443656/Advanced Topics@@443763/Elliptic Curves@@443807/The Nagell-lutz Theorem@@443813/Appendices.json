The problem asks for the complete set $S$ of all integers $y$ that satisfy this divisibility condition, $y^{2} \\mid \\Delta$, and then for its cardinality $|S|$.\n\nThe condition is $y^{2} \\mid -15616$. Since $y^{2}$ is always non-negative, this is equivalent to the condition $y^{2} \\mid 15616$. To find all such integers $y$, we first determine the prime factorization of $15616$. From the calculation in part (a), we have $15616 = 16 \\times 976$.\nWe find the prime factorizations of $16$ and $976$:\n$$16 = 2^{4}$$\n$$976 = 16 \\times 61 = 2^{4} \\times 61$$\nThus, the prime factorization of $15616$ is:\n$$15616 = (2^{4}) \\times (2^{4} \\times 61) = 2^{8} \\times 61^{1}$$\nThe condition is $y^{2} \\mid (2^{8} \\times 61^{1})$. Let the prime factorization of $|y|$ be $|y| = 2^{k} 61^{m}$ for some non-negative integers $k$ and $m$. Then the prime factorization of $y^2$ is $y^{2} = 2^{2k} 61^{2m}$.\nFor $y^2$ to divide $2^{8} \\times 61^{1}$, the exponents in its prime factorization must be less than or equal to the corresponding exponents in the factorization of $2^{8} \\times 61^{1}$.\nThis gives us two inequalities for the exponents:\n1.

Verification of Properties of $E$ and $P$**\n\nThe curve $E$ is given by the equation $Y^2 = X^3 - \\frac{1}{16}X$. This is a short Weierstrass equation of the form $Y^2 = X^3 + aX + b$, with coefficients $a = -\\frac{1}{16}$ and $b = 0$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $E$ is an elliptic curve. An algebraic curve given by a Weierstrass equation is an elliptic curve if and only if it is non-singular. This is equivalent to its discriminant being non-zero. The discriminant $\\Delta$ for a short Weierstrass equation is given by $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$.\nFor the curve $E$, we calculate:\n$$ \\Delta = -16\\left(4\\left(-\\frac{1}{16}\\right)^3 + 27(0)^2\\right) = -16\\left(4\\left(-\\frac{1}{4096}\\right)\\right) = -16\\left(-\\frac{1}{1024}\\right) = \\frac{16}{1024} = \\frac{1}{64} $$\nSince $\\Delta = \\frac{1}{64} \\neq 0$, the curve is non-singular and is therefore an elliptic curve.\n\nNext, we check the coefficients. The coefficients are $a = -\\frac{1}{16}$ and $b = 0$. The coefficient $a$ is not an integer.\n\nFinally, we consider the point $P = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right)$. We verify that $P$ lies on the curve $E$: for $P = (\\frac{1}{4}, 0)$, the left-hand side is $Y^2 = 0^2 = 0$. The right-hand side is $X^3 - \\frac{1}{16}X = (\\frac{1}{4})^3 - \\frac{1}{16}(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{64} - \\frac{1}{64} = 0$. Since $0=0$, the point is on the curve. The coordinates of $P$ are rational numbers. The $X$-coordinate, $\\frac{1}{4}$, is not an integer. To verify that $P$ is a torsion point, we must show that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $nP = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the identity element of the group $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. This will be done in the next part by calculating the order of $P$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Order of $P$**\n\nThe group law on an elliptic curve $Y^2 = f(X) = X^3 + aX + b$ is defined geometrically. The identity element is the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. The inverse of a point $(X_1, Y_1)$ is $(X_1, -Y_1)$. The sum of two points $P_1$ and $P_2$, denoted $P_1+P_2$, is defined as the inverse of the third intersection point of the line passing through $P_1$ and $P_2$ with the curve.\n\nTo find the order of $P = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right)$, we compute its multiples: $P, 2P, 3P, \\dots$. We start by calculating $2P = P+P$. To add a point to itself, we use the tangent line to the curve at that point. The slope of the tangent line at a point $(X_1, Y_1)$ with $Y_1 \\neq 0$ is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{f'(X_1)}{2Y_1} = \\frac{3X_1^2 + a}{2Y_1}$.\n\nFor the point $P = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right)$, the $Y$-coordinate is $Y_1 = 0$. The formula for the slope has a zero in the denominator. This signifies that the tangent line to the curve at $P$ is a vertical line. The equation of this vertical line is $X = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nA vertical line intersects the projective closure of the curve at exactly three points, counted with multiplicity. For the line $X = \\frac{1}{4}$, the finite intersection points are found by substituting into the curve's equation: $Y^2 = (\\frac{1}{4})^3 - \\frac{1}{16}(\\frac{1}{4}) = 0$, which gives $Y=0$. This means the line is tangent to the curve at $P = (\\frac{1}{4}, 0)$, and this intersection has multiplicity $2$. In the projective plane, any vertical line also intersects the curve at one other point: the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nThus, the three intersection points (counted with multiplicity) of the tangent line at $P$ with the curve are $P, P,$ and $\\mathcal{O}$. According to the group law, $P+P+ \\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}$, which implies $P+P = -\\mathcal{O}$. The point at infinity is its own inverse, so $-\\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}$.\nTherefore, we have $2P = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\nThe order of a point is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $nP = \\mathcal{O}$.\nWe have $1P = P = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right) \\neq \\mathcal{O}$.\nWe have calculated $2P = \\mathcal{O}$.\nThe smallest such positive integer is $n=2$. Thus, the order of the point $P$ is $2$. This also completes the verification from Part 1 that $P$ is a rational torsion point.\n\n**3. Explanation Regarding the Nagell–Lutz Theorem**\n\nFirst, we state the relevant part of the Nagell–Lutz theorem.\n**Nagell–Lutz Theorem:** Let $E$ be an elliptic curve given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$, where the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are **integers**. Let $P = (x_0, y_0)$ be a rational point on $E$, i.e., $P \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$. If $P$ is a torsion point, then its coordinates $x_0$ and $y_0$ must be integers.\n\nThe theorem provides a strong condition on the coordinates of rational torsion points, but it carries a crucial hypothesis: the coefficients $a$ and $b$ of the Weierstrass equation must be integers.\n\nNow we analyze the given example $(E, P)$ in light of this theorem.\n-   The curve $E$ is $Y^2 = X^3 - \\frac{1}{16}X$. Its coefficients are $a = -\\frac{1}{16}$ and $b = 0$. The coefficient $a$ is **not an integer**. Therefore, the integrality hypothesis of the Nagell–Lutz theorem is not satisfied for the curve $E$.\n-   In Part 2, we showed that the point $P = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right)$ is a torsion point on $E$ of order $2$.\n-   The coordinates of this torsion point $P$ are not integers; specifically, its $X$-coordinate is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe curve $E$ has a torsion point $P$ whose coordinates are not integers. This does not contradict the Nagell–Lutz theorem because the theorem does not apply to $E$, as its coefficients are not integers. Instead, this example demonstrates that the conclusion of the Nagell–Lutz theorem (that rational torsion points must have integer coordinates) can fail if the hypothesis on the integrality of the coefficients $a$ and $b$ is removed.\n\nThus, the existence of the point $P = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right)$ as a torsion point on the curve $E: Y^2 = X^3 - \\frac{1}{16}X$ shows that the condition $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is a necessary hypothesis for the integrality part of the Nagell–Lutz theorem to hold. Without this hypothesis, curves may possess torsion points with non-integral coordinates, as this example explicitly shows.\nThe curve $E$ is isomorphic to $E_0: y^2 = x^3-x$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ via the map $(x,y) \\mapsto (X,Y) = (x/4, y/8)$. The torsion point $P_0=(1,0)$ on $E_0$, which has integer coordinates as predicted by Nagell–Lutz for $E_0$, maps to the non-integer torsion point $P$ on $E$. This highlights that the integrality property is not an intrinsic property of the abstract elliptic curve, but rather of the specific integral model chosen to represent it.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3092471"}]}
