We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem investigates the congruent number $n=7$ using the associated elliptic curve $E_7: y^2 = x^3 - 49x$. We are asked to find a rational point on this curve starting from the $2$-torsion point $(7,0)$ and then use it to construct a right triangle with rational sides and area $7$.\n\n### Part 1: Intersection Equation and Discriminant\n\nWe are given the elliptic curve $E_n: y^2 = x^3 - n^2x$. For $n=7$, this becomes $E_7: y^2 = x^3 - 49x$.\nWe consider a line passing through the rational $2$-torsion point $(7,0)$ with a rational slope $m$. The equation of this line is $y = m(x-7)$.\n\nTo find the points of intersection between the line and the curve, we substitute the expression for $y$ from the line equation into the curve equation:\n$$\n(m(x-7))^2 = x^3 - 49x\n$$\nWe can factor the right-hand side:\n$$\nm^2(x-7)^2 = x(x^2 - 49) = x(x-7)(x+7)\n$$\nWe can move all terms to one side to form a cubic equation in $x$:\n$$\nx(x-7)(x+7) - m^2(x-7)^2 = 0\n$$\nFactoring out the term $(x-7)$:\n$$\n(x-7)[x(x+7) - m^2(x-7)] = 0\n$$\nThis equation reveals that one intersection point has an $x$-coordinate of $x=7$, which corresponds to the point $(7,0)$ we started with. The other intersection points are given by the roots of the quadratic factor:\n$$\nx(x+7) - m^2(x-7) = 0\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives the quadratic equation for the $x$-coordinates of the nontrivial intersections:\n$$\nx^2 + 7x - m^2x + 7m^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\nx^2 + (7 - m^2)x + 7m^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is the required quadratic equation.\n\nNext, we identify its discriminant, $\\Delta$, using the formula $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$ for a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C=0$. Here, $A=1$, $B = 7-m^2$, and $C = 7m^2$.\n$$\n\\Delta = (7 - m^2)^2 - 4(1)(7m^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = (49 - 14m^2 + m^4) - 28m^2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = m^4 - 42m^2 + 49\n$$\nThis is the discriminant as a function of the slope $m$.\n\n### Part 2: Finding a Rational Point\n\nFor the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points to be rational, the discriminant $\\Delta$ must be the square of a rational number. The problem provides a specific rational slope $m = \\frac{20}{3}$ which satisfies this condition. Let's use this value.\nFirst, we compute $m^2$:\n$$\nm^2 = \\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{400}{9}\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for the discriminant:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{400}{9}\\right)^2 - 42\\left(\\frac{400}{9}\\right) + 49\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{160000}{81} - \\frac{16800}{9} + 49 = \\frac{160000 - 151200 + 3969}{81} = \\frac{12769}{81}\n$$\nWe check if this is a rational square:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{12769}{81}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{12769}}{\\sqrt{81}} = \\frac{113}{9}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{113}{9}$ is a rational number, the roots of the quadratic equation for $x$ will be rational.\n\nThe roots are given by the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2A}$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-(7-m^2) \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2} = \\frac{m^2-7 \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the values for $m^2$ and $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{\\frac{400}{9} - 7 \\pm \\frac{113}{9}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{400-63}{9} \\pm \\frac{113}{9}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{337}{9} \\pm \\frac{113}{9}}{2}\n$$\nThis gives two rational roots:\n$$\nx_1 = \\frac{\\frac{337+113}{9}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{450}{9}}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n$$\n$$\nx_2 = \\frac{\\frac{337-113}{9}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{224}{9}}{2} = \\frac{112}{9}\n$$\nThese are the $x$-coordinates of the two other intersection points. To find the full coordinates of these points, we use the line equation $y = m(x-7) = \\frac{20}{3}(x-7)$.\nFor $x_1 = 25$:\n$$\ny_1 = \\frac{20}{3}(25-7) = \\frac{20}{3}(18) = 120\n$$\nThis gives the point $P_1 = (25, 120)$. Both coordinates are integers, which simplifies further calculations.\n\nFor $x_2 = \\frac{112}{9}$:\n$$\ny_2 = \\frac{20}{3}\\left(\\frac{112}{9} - 7\\right) = \\frac{20}{3}\\left(\\frac{112 - 63}{9}\\right) = \\frac{20}{3}\\left(\\frac{49}{9}\\right) = \\frac{980}{27}\n$$\nThis gives the point $P_2 = \\left(\\frac{112}{9}, \\frac{980}{27}\\right)$.\nBoth $P_1$ and $P_2$ are rational points on $E_7$ with $y \\neq 0$. The problem asks for \"the\" rational point $P$, which is an ambiguity. As shown in Part 3, both points lead to the same congruent triangle (up to swapping the legs). We choose the arithmetically simpler point $P = P_1 = (25, 120)$ to proceed. The question asks for the $x$-coordinate of this point.\n\n### Part 3: The Corresponding Right Triangle\n\nWe use the standard birational map from a point $(x,y)$ on $E_n: y^2 = x^3 - n^2x$ to a right triangle with sides $(a,b,c)$ and area $n$:\n$$ a = \\frac{x^2 - n^2}{y}, \\quad b = \\frac{2nx}{y}, \\quad c = \\frac{x^2 + n^2}{y} $$\nUsing $n=7$ and the point $P=(x,y)=(25,120)$:\n$$\na = \\frac{25^2 - 7^2}{120} = \\frac{625 - 49}{120} = \\frac{576}{120} = \\frac{24 \\times 24}{5 \\times 24} = \\frac{24}{5}\n$$\n$$\nb = \\frac{2(7)(25)}{120} = \\frac{350}{120} = \\frac{35 \\times 10}{12 \\times 10} = \\frac{35}{12}\n$$\n$$\nc = \\frac{25^2 + 7^2}{120} = \\frac{625 + 49}{120} = \\frac{674}{120} = \\frac{337 \\times 2}{60 \\times 2} = \\frac{337}{60}\n$$\nThe sides of the triangle are $a=\\frac{24}{5}$, $b=\\frac{35}{12}$, and hypotenuse $c=\\frac{337}{60}$.\n\nWe verify the Pythagorean relation, $a^2+b^2=c^2$:\n$$\na^2+b^2 = \\left(\\frac{24}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{35}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{576}{25} + \\frac{1225}{144}\n$$\nThe common denominator is $25 \\times 144 = 3600$.\n$$\na^2+b^2 = \\frac{576 \\times 144 + 1225 \\times 25}{3600} = \\frac{82944 + 30625}{3600} = \\frac{113569}{3600}\n$$\nFor the hypotenuse squared:\n$$\nc^2 = \\left(\\frac{337}{60}\\right)^2 = \\frac{337^2}{3600} = \\frac{113569}{3600}\n$$\nThe relation $a^2+b^2=c^2$ holds.\n\nFinally, we verify the area of the triangle:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{24}{5} \\times \\frac{35}{12} = \\frac{24 \\times 35}{2 \\times 5 \\times 12} = \\frac{24 \\times 35}{120} = \\frac{840}{120} = 7\n$$\nThe area is indeed $7$. The procedure is complete and yields a consistent result.

Recovery of the point $P=(x,y)$ from the triangle $(a,b,c)=\\left(\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{20}{3},\\frac{41}{6}\\right)$**\n\nWe are given the relations for converting a rational right triangle of area $n$ to a rational point on the curve $E_n$:\n$$a y=x^2-n^2,\\quad b y=2nx,\\quad c y=x^2+n^2$$\nWith $n=5$, $a=\\frac{3}{2}$, and $b=\\frac{20}{3}$, the second equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{20}{3}y = 2(5)x \\implies \\frac{20}{3}y = 10x $$\nFrom this, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n$$ y = \\frac{3}{20}(10x) = \\frac{3}{2}x $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation, $a y=x^2-n^2$:\n$$ \\frac{3}{2}y = x^2-25 $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}x\\right) = x^2-25 $$\n$$ \\frac{9}{4}x = x^2-25 $$\nMultiplying by $4$ to clear the denominator gives a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$$ 9x = 4x^2-100 $$\n$$ 4x^2-9x-100 = 0 $$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}$:\n$$ x = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{(-9)^{2} - 4(4)(-100)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 + 1600}}{8} = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{1681}}{8} $$\nSince $41^2=1681$, we have $\\sqrt{1681}=41$. The two possible rational solutions for $x$ are:\n$$ x_{1} = \\frac{9+41}{8} = \\frac{50}{8} = \\frac{25}{4} $$\n$$ x_{2} = \\frac{9-41}{8} = \\frac{-32}{8} = -4 $$\nAccording to the standard correspondence, the $x$-coordinate is expected to be positive. Let's determine the correct $x$ by calculating the corresponding $y$ values and checking against the third equation, $c y=x^2+n^2$, with $c=\\frac{41}{6}$.\n\nCase 1: $x = \\frac{25}{4}$.\nThe corresponding $y$ is $y = \\frac{3}{2}x = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right) = \\frac{75}{8}$.\nLet's check the third equation: $c y = \\frac{41}{6}\\left(\\frac{75}{8}\\right) = \\frac{3075}{48} = \\frac{1025}{16}$.\nAnd $x^2+n^2 = \\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right)^2+25 = \\frac{625}{16} + \\frac{400}{16} = \\frac{1025}{16}$.\nThe values match. Thus, the point is $P=\\left(\\frac{25}{4}, \\frac{75}{8}\\right)$.\n\nCase 2: $x = -4$.\nThe corresponding $y$ is $y = \\frac{3}{2}x = \\frac{3}{2}(-4) = -6$.\nLet's check the third equation: $c y = \\frac{41}{6}(-6) = -41$.\nAnd $x^2+n^2 = (-4)^2+25 = 16+25 = 41$.\nSince $-41 \\neq 41$, this solution is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the point on $E_{5}$ corresponding to the given triangle is $P=\\left(\\frac{25}{4}, \\frac{75}{8}\\right)$. We can verify it lies on $y^2 = x^3 - 25x$:\n$y^2 = (\\frac{75}{8})^2 = \\frac{5625}{64}$.\n$x^3-25x = (\\frac{25}{4})^3 - 25(\\frac{25}{4}) = \\frac{15625}{64} - \\frac{625}{4} = \\frac{15625 - 10000}{64} = \\frac{5625}{64}$.\nThe point $P$ is indeed on the curve $E_5$.\n\n**2. Computation of $2P$ via the duplication process**\n\nThe group law on an elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - n^2x$ defines the sum of two points. To compute $2P = P+P$, we use the duplication formula, which is derived from finding the tangent line at $P$ and its third intersection point with the curve.\n\nFirst, we find the slope $m$ of the tangent line to the curve at a point $(x,y)$ by implicit differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - n^2x) $$\n$$ 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - n^2 $$\n$$ m = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 - n^2}{2y} $$\nAt our point $P=(x_1, y_1) = \\left(\\frac{25}{4}, \\frac{75}{8}\\right)$ with $n^2=25$:\n$$ m = \\frac{3\\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right)^2 - 25}{2\\left(\\frac{75}{8}\\right)} = \\frac{3\\left(\\frac{625}{16}\\right) - \\frac{400}{16}}{\\frac{75}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1875-400}{16}}{\\frac{75}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1475}{16}}{\\frac{75}{4}} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{1475}{16} \\cdot \\frac{4}{75} = \\frac{1475}{4 \\cdot 75} = \\frac{1475}{300} = \\frac{59 \\cdot 25}{12 \\cdot 25} = \\frac{59}{12} $$\nThe tangent line at $P=(x_1, y_1)$ is $Y = m(X-x_1)+y_1$. To find the intersections with the curve $Y^2=X^3-n^2X$, we substitute $Y$:\n$$ (m(X-x_1)+y_1)^2 = X^3-n^2X $$\nExpanding the left side and rearranging yields a cubic equation of the form $X^3 - m^2X^2 + \\dots = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots $X_1, X_2, X_3$ is equal to the negative of the coefficient of the $X^2$ term, which is $m^2$. Since the line is tangent at $P$, the root $x_1$ has multiplicity $2$. Thus, $X_1=x_1$ and $X_2=x_1$. The sum of the roots is:\n$$ x_1 + x_1 + x_3 = m^2 $$\nThe $x$-coordinate of the third intersection point is $x_3 = m^2 - 2x_1$. The point $2P$ is the reflection of this third intersection point across the $x$-axis. The reflection does not change the $x$-coordinate. So, the $x$-coordinate of $2P$, which we denote as $x_{2P}$, is $x_3$.\n$$ x_{2P} = m^2 - 2x_1 $$\nNow we substitute the values $m=\\frac{59}{12}$ and $x_1=\\frac{25}{4}$:\n$$ x_{2P} = \\left(\\frac{59}{12}\\right)^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3481}{144} - \\frac{50}{4} $$\nTo subtract, we find a common denominator:\n$$ x_{2P} = \\frac{3481}{144} - \\frac{50 \\cdot 36}{4 \\cdot 36} = \\frac{3481}{144} - \\frac{1800}{144} = \\frac{3481 - 1800}{144} = \\frac{1681}{144} $$\nThe $x$-coordinate of $2P$ is $\\frac{1681}{144}$.\n\n**3. Interpretation of the transformation from $P$ to $2P$**\n\nThe point $2P = (x_{2P}, y_{2P})$ also corresponds to a rational right triangle of area $n=5$. Let this new point be $(x', y')=(x_{2P}, y_{2P})$ and the new triangle be $(a', b', c')$. The sides of the new triangle are given by the same bijection:\n$$ a' = \\frac{x'^2-n^2}{y'}, \\quad b' = \\frac{2nx'}{y'}, \\quad c' = \\frac{x'^2+n^2}{y'} $$\nThe area of the new triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2}a'b'$ (taking side lengths to be positive, we use absolute values).\n$$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}|a'||b'| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\frac{x'^2-n^2}{y'}\\right| \\left|\\frac{2nx'}{y'}\\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{|2n| |x'(x'^2-n^2)|}{y'^2} $$\nSince $(x', y')$ is a point on the elliptic curve $E_n$, its coordinates satisfy $y'^2=x'^3-n^2x' = x'(x'^2-n^2)$. Substituting this into the area formula:\n$$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{|2n| |x'(x'^2-n^2)|}{|x'(x'^2-n^2)|} $$\nAssuming $x' \\neq 0$ and $x'^2 \\neq n^2$ (the points of order $2$), the fraction simplifies to $1$. In our case, $x' = \\frac{1681}{144}$ which is not $0$ or $\\pm 5$. Thus:\n$$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}|2n| = n $$\nThis demonstrates that the new triangle also has area $n=5$. The group law operation of doubling a point $P$ on the elliptic curve $E_n$ corresponds to a rational transformation which takes the congruent number triangle associated with $P$ to another congruent number triangle (with the same area $n$) associated with the point $2P$. Specifically, the point $P=(x_1, y_1)$ with $y_1>0$ maps to a triangle with positive side lengths. The point $2P=(x_{2P}, y_{2P})$ may have a negative $y$-coordinate, which would yield negative values for $a',b',c'$. The geometric triangle is recovered by taking the absolute values of these side lengths.\n\nThe final answer required is the exact rational value of the $x$-coordinate of $2P$.\n$$ x_{2P} = \\frac{1681}{144} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1681}{144}}$$", "id": "3090583"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the geometric world of elliptic curves, the congruent number problem can be tackled using powerful modern criteria.

Thus, $z$ must be $0$.\n- Setting $z=0$ simplifies the equation to: $3 = 2x^{2} + 2y^{2} = 2(x^2+y^2)$.\n- The left-hand side of this equation is an odd integer (3), while the right-hand side is an even integer ($2$ times an integer). It is impossible for an odd integer to equal an even integer. Therefore, this equation has no integer solutions for $x$ and $y$.\nThere are no integer solutions for the equation for $B(6)$ either.\n$$B(6) = 0$$\n\nBased on these explicit computations, we find that $A(6)=0$ and $B(6)=0$. We are asked to analyze the equality $B(6) = 2A(6)$. Substituting our results, we get $0 = 2 \\times 0$, which is true. The equality holds.\n\nThe significance of this result is understood through Tunnell's theorem. For a square-free integer $n$, the theorem provides a link between $n$ being a congruent number and the number of solutions to these equations.\n- **Unconditionally:** If $n$ is a congruent number, then $B(n) = 2A(n)$.\n- **Conditionally (assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is true):** If $B(n) = 2A(n)$, then $n$ is a congruent number.\n\nIn our case, $n=6$ is a known congruent number, as it is the area of the right triangle with integer sides $(3, 4, 5)$. Our calculation confirms the unconditional part of Tunnell's theorem: since $n=6$ is congruent, it must satisfy $B(6)=2A(6)$, and our result $0=2(0)$ is consistent with this. This provides a concrete example of the theorem in action.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3090571"}]}
