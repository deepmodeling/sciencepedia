Singularity modulo a prime $r$ is equivalent to $4 a^{3} + 27 b^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{r}$. We verify this modulo $p = 101$ and modulo the complementary prime $q = N / p = 10403 / 101 = 103$.\n\nCompute modulo $p = 101$:\n$$\na \\equiv 99 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{101}, \\quad b \\equiv 454 \\equiv 50 \\pmod{101}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n4 a^{3} + 27 b^{2} \\equiv 4(-2)^{3} + 27 \\cdot 50^{2} \\equiv 4(-8) + 27 \\cdot 2500 \\pmod{101}.\n$$\nReduce each term modulo $101$:\n$$\n4(-8) \\equiv -32 \\equiv 69 \\pmod{101},\n$$\nand\n$$\n50^{2} = 2500 \\equiv 2500 - 24 \\cdot 101 = 2500 - 2424 = 76 \\pmod{101}, \\quad 27 \\cdot 76 = 2052 \\equiv 2052 - 20 \\cdot 101 = 32 \\pmod{101}.\n$$\nThus\n$$\n4 a^{3} + 27 b^{2} \\equiv 69 + 32 = 101 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{101},\n$$\nso $E$ is singular modulo $p$.\n\nCompute modulo $q = 103$:\n$$\na \\equiv 99 \\pmod{103}, \\quad b \\equiv 454 \\equiv 42 \\pmod{103}.\n$$\nWe have $a^{3} \\equiv 99^{3} \\equiv (-4)^{3} \\equiv -64 \\equiv 39 \\pmod{103}$, so $4 a^{3} \\equiv 4 \\cdot 39 \\equiv 156 \\equiv 53 \\pmod{103}$. Also $b^{2} \\equiv 42^{2} = 1764 \\equiv 1764 - 17 \\cdot 103 = 13 \\pmod{103}$, hence $27 b^{2} \\equiv 27 \\cdot 13 = 351 \\equiv 351 - 3 \\cdot 103 = 42 \\pmod{103}$. Therefore\n$$\n4 a^{3} + 27 b^{2} \\equiv 53 + 42 = 95 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{103},\n$$\nso $E$ is nonsingular modulo $q$.\n\nThis confirms that our chosen example is singular modulo the hidden factor $p$ and that the first doubling step triggers a greatest common divisor computation yielding $p$ immediately.\n\nTherefore, the prime factor revealed by early ECM arithmetic is $p = 101$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{101}$$", "id": "3091785"}]}
