The group law is defined geometrically via the chord-tangent process.\n\n**Part 1: Identify the rational point $P$**\n\nWe are asked to find a point $P = (x, y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$ with integer coordinates, the smallest positive integer $x$-coordinate, and $y > 0$. We test small positive integer values for $x$:\n- If $x=1$, $y^2 = 1^3 - 7 = -6$. There are no real solutions for $y$, and thus no rational solutions.\n- If $x=2$, $y^2 = 2^3 - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1$. This gives $y = \\pm 1$.\nSince we require $y > 0$, we have $y = 1$. The integer $x=2$ is the smallest positive integer for which $y^2$ is a perfect square.\nThus, the point is $P = (2, 1)$.\n\n**Part 2: Compute $2P$**\n\nTo compute $2P = P+P$, we use the tangent line to the curve $E$ at the point $P=(2, 1)$. The general group law requires that if we add a point $P_1=(x_1, y_1)$ to itself, the sum $2P_1$ is found by first taking the tangent line at $P_1$. This line will intersect the curve at a second point, $R$. The sum $2P_1$ is then the reflection of $R$ across the $x$-axis.\n\nFirst, we find the slope of the tangent line by implicit differentiation of the curve equation $y^2 = x^3 - 7$:\n$$ 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2}{2y} $$\nThe denominator $2y$ is non-zero for any rational point on this curve, because $y=0$ would imply $x^3=7$, for which there is no rational solution $x$. At $P=(2, 1)$, the slope $m_{2P}$ is:\n$$ m_{2P} = \\frac{3(2)^2}{2(1)} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 $$\nThe equation of the tangent line at $P(2, 1)$ is $y - 1 = 6(x-2)$, which simplifies to $y = 6x - 11$.\n\nNext, we find the coordinates of the third intersection point, let's call it $R_{2P} = (x_R, y_R)$, by substituting the line equation into the curve equation:\n$$ (6x - 11)^2 = x^3 - 7 $$\n$$ 36x^2 - 132x + 121 = x^3 - 7 $$\n$$ x^3 - 36x^2 + 132x - 128 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this cubic polynomial in $x$ are the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points. Since the line is tangent at $x=2$, this root has a multiplicity of two. Let the three roots be $x_P, x_P, x_R$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is equal to the negative of the coefficient of the $x^2$ term:\n$$ x_P + x_P + x_R = -(-36) = 36 $$\n$$ 2 + 2 + x_R = 36 \\implies x_R = 32 $$\nTo find $y_R$, we use the tangent line equation:\n$$ y_R = 6x_R - 11 = 6(32) - 11 = 192 - 11 = 181 $$\nSo, the third intersection point is $R_{2P} = (32, 181)$. The point $2P$ is the reflection of $R_{2P}$ across the $x$-axis:\n$$ 2P = (x_R, -y_R) = (32, -181) $$\nWe can verify that this point lies on the curve: $(-181)^2 = 32761$ and $32^3 - 7 = 32768 - 7 = 32761$.\n\n**Part 3: Compute $3P = 2P + P$**\n\nTo compute $3P$, we add the points $2P = (32, -181)$ and $P = (2, 1)$ using the chord-tangent law. We find the slope of the secant line connecting these two points. Let $P_1 = 2P = (x_1, y_1) = (32, -181)$ and $P_2 = P = (x_2, y_2) = (2, 1)$. The slope $m_{3P}$ is:\n$$ m_{3P} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{1 - (-181)}{2 - 32} = \\frac{182}{-30} = -\\frac{91}{15} $$\nThe denominator $x_2 - x_1 = -30$ is non-zero, so the line is not vertical.\nThe equation of the line is $y - y_2 = m_{3P}(x-x_2)$, so $y - 1 = -\\frac{91}{15}(x-2)$.\n\nLet the third intersection point of this line with the curve be $R_{3P} = (x'_R, y'_R)$. Similar to the previous step, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the three intersection points ($x_1, x_2, x'_R$) is equal to the square of the slope:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + x'_R = (m_{3P})^2 $$\n$$ x'_R = (m_{3P})^2 - x_1 - x_2 $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ x'_R = \\left(-\\frac{91}{15}\\right)^2 - 32 - 2 = \\frac{8281}{225} - 34 = \\frac{8281 - 34 \\times 225}{225} = \\frac{8281 - 7650}{225} = \\frac{631}{225} $$\nThe point $3P = (x_{3P}, y_{3P})$ will have $x_{3P} = x'_R = \\frac{631}{225}$. To find $y_{3P}$, we first find $y'_R$ using the line equation and then reflect across the $x$-axis. The point $(x'_R, y'_R)$ lies on the secant line:\n$$ y'_R = m_{3P}(x'_R - x_2) + y_2 $$\n$$ y'_R = -\\frac{91}{15}\\left(\\frac{631}{225} - 2\\right) + 1 = -\\frac{91}{15}\\left(\\frac{631 - 450}{225}\\right) + 1 = -\\frac{91}{15}\\left(\\frac{181}{225}\\right) + 1 $$\n$$ y'_R = -\\frac{16471}{3375} + \\frac{3375}{3375} = -\\frac{13096}{3375} $$\nThe point $3P$ is the reflection of $R_{3P}=(x'_R, y'_R)$ across the $x$-axis, so $y_{3P} = -y'_R$:\n$$ y_{3P} = - \\left(-\\frac{13096}{3375}\\right) = \\frac{13096}{3375} $$\nThe denominator of $x_{3P}$ is $225 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. The numerator $631$ is not divisible by $3$ or $5$, so $x_{3P}$ is in lowest terms. The denominator of $y_{3P}$ is $3375 = 3^3 \\times 5^3$. The numerator $13096$ is not divisible by $3$ (sum of digits is $19$) or $5$, so $y_{3P}$ is also in lowest terms.\n\nThe coordinates of $3P$ are $\\left(\\frac{631}{225}, \\frac{13096}{3375}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{631}{225} & \\frac{13096}{3375}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3091433"}]}
