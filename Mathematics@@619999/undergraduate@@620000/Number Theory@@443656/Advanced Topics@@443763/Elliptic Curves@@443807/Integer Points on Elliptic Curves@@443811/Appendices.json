Let $N$ be the number of such solutions.\n\nThe strategy to find all integer points will proceed as follows:\n1.  Identify trivial solutions and restrict the domain for non-trivial solutions.\n2.  Analyze the consequences of the factorization $y^{2} = x(x-2)(x+2)$ by considering the parity of $x$. This step provides strong constraints, effectively bounding the search space.\n3.  Solve the resulting Diophantine equations, which involve systems of Pell-type equations.\n4.  Confirm findings using modular arithmetic, as suggested by the problem.\n5.  State the complete set of integer points and the total count $N$.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the equation in its factored form:\n$$y^{2} = x(x^{2}-4) = x(x-2)(x+2)$$\n\n**Step 1: Trivial Solutions and Domain Restriction**\n\nIf $y=0$, the equation becomes $x(x-2)(x+2) = 0$. This yields three integer solutions for $x$: $x=0$, $x=2$, and $x=-2$. The corresponding integer points are $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, and $(-2,0)$.\n\nIf $y \\neq 0$, then $y^{2}$ must be a positive integer. This requires the product $x(x-2)(x+2)$ to be a positive integer. The roots of the polynomial $P(x) = x(x-2)(x+2)$ are at $x=-2, 0, 2$. The polynomial is positive for $x \\in (-2, 0) \\cup (2, \\infty)$.\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the possible values for $x$ are $x=-1$ or $x \\ge 3$.\n- If $x=-1$, $y^{2} = (-1)^{3} - 4(-1) = -1+4=3$. This does not yield an integer solution for $y$.\n- Therefore, any non-trivial integer solutions must have $x \\ge 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Factorization Analysis based on Parity**\n\nWe analyze the equation $y^{2} = x(x-2)(x+2)$ for integer $x \\ge 3$.\n\nCase 1: $x$ is odd.\nIf $x$ is odd, then $x-2$ and $x+2$ are also odd. The three factors $x-2$, $x$, and $x+2$ are pairwise coprime.\n- $\\gcd(x, x-2) = \\gcd(x, -2) = 1$ (since $x$ is odd).\n- $\\gcd(x, x+2) = \\gcd(x, 2) = 1$ (since $x$ is odd).\n- $\\gcd(x-2, x+2) = \\gcd(x-2, 4) = 1$ (since $x-2$ is odd).\n\nSince the product of these three positive, pairwise coprime integers is a perfect square ($y^2$), each factor must itself be a perfect square.\nLet $x-2 = a^2$, $x=b^2$, and $x+2=c^2$ for some integers $a, b, c$.\nFrom the first two equations, we have $b^2 - a^2 = x - (x-2) = 2$.\nThis can be factored as $(b-a)(b+a)=2$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $(b-a)$ and $(b+a)$ must be integer divisors of $2$. The possible pairs of factors for $2$ are $(1, 2)$, $(-2, -1)$, $(-1, -2)$, and $(2, 1)$.\nIn each case, we can solve for $a$ and $b$:\n- $b-a=1, b+a=2 \\implies 2b=3 \\implies b=3/2$, not an integer.\n- $b-a=-2, b+a=-1 \\implies 2b=-3 \\implies b=-3/2$, not an integer.\nThe other two pairs yield the same non-integer solutions for $b$.\nThus, there are no integer solutions when $x$ is odd.\n\nCase 2: $x$ is even.\nSince we are considering $x \\ge 3$, any even $x$ must satisfy $x \\ge 4$. Let $x=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 2$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$y^2 = (2k)(2k-2)(2k+2) = 8k(k-1)(k+1)$.\nThis implies $y^2$ is divisible by $8$, so $y$ must be divisible by $4$? No, if $y=2m$, $y^2=4m^2$. If $y=4m$, $y^2=16m^2$. Let's be more careful. $y^2 = 8 \\times (\\text{integer})$ implies $y^2$ is divisible by $4$, so $y$ is even. Let $y=2Y$.\n$(2Y)^2 = 4Y^2 = 8k(k-1)(k+1) \\implies Y^2 = 2k(k-1)(k+1)$.\nThis implies $Y$ is also even. Let $Y=2Z$.\n$(2Z)^2 = 4Z^2 = 2k(k-1)(k+1) \\implies 2Z^2 = k(k-1)(k+1)$.\nWe need to find integer solutions for $k \\ge 2$ to the equation $(k-1)k(k+1) = 2Z^2$.\n\nSubcase 2a: $k$ is even.\nLet $k=2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$ (since $k \\ge 2$).\nThe equation becomes $(2m-1)(2m)(2m+1) = 2Z^2 \\implies m(2m-1)(2m+1) = Z^2$.\nThe factors $m$, $2m-1$, and $2m+1$ are pairwise coprime:\n- $\\gcd(m, 2m-1) = \\gcd(m, -1)=1$.\n- $\\gcd(m, 2m+1) = \\gcd(m, 1)=1$.\n- $\\gcd(2m-1, 2m+1) = \\gcd(2m-1, 2)=1$ (since $2m-1$ is odd).\nSince their product is a square, each must be a square. Let $m=a^2$, $2m-1=b^2$, $2m+1=c^2$.\nFrom the last two, we have $c^2-b^2 = (2m+1)-(2m-1)=2$.\nThis factors as $(c-b)(c+b)=2$. As shown in Case 1, this equation has no integer solutions for $b$ and $c$.\nThus, there are no solutions when $k$ is even.\n\nSubcase 2b: $k$ is odd.\nLet $k=2m+1$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$ (since $k \\ge 3$).\nThe equation becomes $(2m)(2m+1)(2m+2) = 2Z^2 \\implies 4m(m+1)(2m+1) = 2Z^2 \\implies 2m(m+1)(2m+1) = Z^2$.\nThe factors $m, m+1, 2m+1$ are pairwise coprime. Since their product, multiplied by $2$, is a square, we must distribute the factor of $2$ among their square-free parts. This leads to a few possibilities:\n1.  $m=2a^2$, $m+1=b^2$, $2m+1=c^2$.\n    From $m+1=b^2$ and $m=2a^2$, we get $b^2-2a^2=1$, which is a Pell's equation.\n    From $2m+1=c^2$ and $m=b^2-1$, we get $2(b^2-1)+1=c^2 \\implies 2b^2-1=c^2$. This is a Pell-type equation $c^2-2b^2=-1$.\n    We need to find a common solution $b$ to both $b^2-2a^2=1$ and $c^2-2b^2=-1$.\n    The solutions $(b_n, a_n)$ for the first equation are generated by $(3+2\\sqrt{2})^n$. The values for $b$ are $b \\in \\{1, 3, 17, 99, \\dots\\}$. The case $b=1$ gives $a=0$, so $m=0$, which contradicts $m \\ge 1$.\n    The solutions $(c_k, b'_k)$ for the second equation are generated by $(1+\\sqrt{2})^{2k+1}$. The values for $b'$ are $b' \\in \\{1, 5, 29, \\dots\\}$.\n    The only common value is $b=1$, which corresponds to $m=0$ and is not in the domain $m \\ge 1$.\n2.  $m=a^2$, $m+1=2b^2$, $2m+1=c^2$.\n    Substituting $m=a^2$, the third equation becomes $2a^2+1=c^2$, so $c^2-2a^2=1$. This is a Pell's equation.\n    Substituting $m=a^2$ into the second equation gives $a^2+1=2b^2$, so $a^2-2b^2=-1$.\n    We need an integer $a$ that is a solution to both Pell-type equations.\n    The solutions for $a$ in $c^2-2a^2=1$ are $a \\in \\{0, 2, 12, 70, \\dots\\}$.\n    The solutions for $a$ in $a^2-2b^2=-1$ are $a \\in \\{1, 7, 41, \\dots\\}$.\n    There are no common non-zero values. The value $a=0$ results in $m=0$, which is not in the domain $m \\ge 1$.\n3.  Other distributions of the factor $2$ can be similarly shown to yield no solutions for $m \\ge 1$. For instance, if $2m+1=2c^2$, it is impossible since the left side is odd.\n\nBoth subcases for $x$ even ($x \\geq 4$) fail to produce integer solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Verification with Modular Arithmetic**\n\nLet's check for congruence conditions on the solutions modulo a small prime, e.g., $p=3$.\nThe equation is $y^2 \\equiv x^3 - 4x \\equiv x^3-x \\pmod 3$.\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^3 \\equiv x \\pmod 3$ for all integers $x$.\nThus, $y^2 \\equiv x-x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\nThis implies that for any integer solution $(x,y)$, $y$ must be a multiple of $3$.\nLet's check our identified points: $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(-2,0)$. In all these points, $y=0$, which is a multiple of $3$. This is consistent.\n\nNow let's check modulo $4$.\n$y^2 \\equiv x^3 - 4x \\equiv x^3 \\pmod 4$.\nThe squares modulo $4$ are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 0$, $3^2 \\equiv 1$. So $y^2 \\in \\{0,1\\} \\pmod 4$.\nLet's check values of $x^3 \\pmod 4$:\n- $x \\equiv 0 \\implies x^3 \\equiv 0$. This is possible.\n- $x \\equiv 1 \\implies x^3 \\equiv 1$. This is possible.\n- $x \\equiv 2 \\implies x^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 0$. This is possible.\n- $x \\equiv 3 \\implies x^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 3$. $y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ is impossible.\nSo, any integer solution must have $x \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. Our solutions $x=0, 2, -2$ satisfy this ($0 \\equiv 0$, $2 \\equiv 2$, $-2 \\equiv 2$). The case 'x is odd', which we already ruled out, could have been split into $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, with the latter being impossible.\n\n**Step 4: Nagell-Lutz Theorem Check**\nThe Nagell-Lutz theorem concerns rational torsion points. For the curve $y^2 = x^3+Ax+B$ with integer coefficients, any rational torsion point $(x,y)$ must have integer coordinates, and either $y=0$ or $y^2$ divides the discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4A^3+27B^2)$.\nHere, $A=-4, B=0$, so $\\Delta = -16(4(-4)^3) = -16(-256) = 4096 = 2^{12}$.\nThe points with $y=0$ are $(-2,0), (0,0), (2,0)$. These are all torsion points of order $2$.\nAny other integer torsion point must have $y \\neq 0$ and $y^2$ must be a square divisor of $4096$. Thus $y$ must be a power of $2$, i.e., $y \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\dots, \\pm 64 \\}$. A search for integer $x$ values for each of these $y^2$ values in $x^3-4x-y^2=0$ reveals no solutions (e.g., if $y^2=4$, $x^3-4x-4=0$ has no integer roots by the rational root theorem). This confirms there are no other integer points of finite order. While this does not rule out integer points of infinite rank, our main algebraic argument has already done so.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe comprehensive analysis shows that the only integer solutions occur when $y=0$. These solutions are $(-2,0)$, $(0,0)$, and $(2,0)$.\nThe total number of integer points on the curve is $N=3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "3086243"}, {"introduction": "While elementary methods are powerful, some curves require more advanced techniques, as you'll explore by tackling two distinct Mordell curves of the form $y^2 = x^3 + k$.

The final goal is to compute $S = N_{-2} + N_{7}$.\n\nThe problem is validated as self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded in the field of number theory. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Determination of $N_{-2}$ for the curve $E_{-2}: y^{2} = x^{3} - 2$.\n\nWe rearrange the equation as $y^{2} + 2 = x^{3}$. This form suggests working in the ring of integers of the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}] = \\{a+b\\sqrt{-2} \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This ring is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), as it is a Euclidean domain. The units in this ring are $\\pm 1$.\n\nWe factor the equation in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$:\n$$ (y + \\sqrt{-2})(y - \\sqrt{-2}) = x^{3} $$\nLet $d$ be a greatest common divisor of the two factors, $y + \\sqrt{-2}$ and $y - \\sqrt{-2}$, in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$. Then $d$ must divide their difference:\n$$ d \\mid (y + \\sqrt{-2}) - (y - \\sqrt{-2}) = 2\\sqrt{-2} = -(\\sqrt{-2})^{3} $$\nThe prime factors of $2\\sqrt{-2}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$ are, up to units, just $\\sqrt{-2}$. Thus, $d$ must be of the form $u(\\sqrt{-2})^{j}$ for some unit $u \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ and integer $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nAlso, $d$ divides $y+\\sqrt{-2}$, so the norm of $d$, $N(d)$, must divide the norm of $y+\\sqrt{-2}$.\n$$ N(y+\\sqrt{-2}) = y^{2} + 2 = x^{3} $$\nLet us examine the parity of $x$ and $y$. If $x$ is even, say $x=2k$, then $y^{2} = (2k)^{3} - 2 = 8k^{3}-2$. This implies $y^{2} \\equiv -2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 8$. The squares modulo $8$ are $0^{2}\\equiv 0$, $1^{2}\\equiv 1$, $2^{2}\\equiv 4$, $3^{2}\\equiv 1$, $4^{2}\\equiv 0$, $5^{2}\\equiv 1$, $6^{2}\\equiv 4$, $7^{2}\\equiv 1$. The set of quadratic residues modulo $8$ is $\\{0,1,4\\}$. Since $6$ is not in this set, $y^{2} \\equiv 6 \\pmod 8$ has no integer solutions for $y$. Thus, $x$ cannot be even; $x$ must be odd.\n\nIf $x$ is odd, then $x^{3}$ is odd. Then $y^{2} = x^{3}-2$ must be odd, which implies $y$ must be odd.\nSince $x$ is odd, $x^{3}$ is odd. As $N(d)$ divides $x^{3}$, $N(d)$ must be odd.\nSince $d$ also divides $2\\sqrt{-2}$, $N(d)$ must divide $N(2\\sqrt{-2}) = N(0+2\\sqrt{-2}) = 0^2 - (-2)(2^2) = 8$. The divisors of $8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8$. The only odd divisor is $1$. Thus, $N(d)=1$.\nAn element in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$ with norm $1$ must be a unit. Therefore, $d$ is a unit. This means the factors $y+\\sqrt{-2}$ and $y-\\sqrt{-2}$ are coprime in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$.\n\nSince $(y+\\sqrt{-2})(y-\\sqrt{-2})$ is a perfect cube and the factors are coprime in a UFD, each factor must itself be a perfect cube, up to a unit factor. Since the only units are $\\pm 1$ and $-1 = (-1)^{3}$ can be absorbed into the cube, we can write:\n$$ y + \\sqrt{-2} = (a+b\\sqrt{-2})^{3} $$\nfor some integers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Expanding the cube:\n$$ (a+b\\sqrt{-2})^{3} = a^{3} + 3a^{2}(b\\sqrt{-2}) + 3a(b\\sqrt{-2})^{2} + (b\\sqrt{-2})^{3} $$\n$$ = a^{3} + 3a^{2}b\\sqrt{-2} - 6ab^{2} - 2b^{3}\\sqrt{-2} $$\n$$ = (a^{3} - 6ab^{2}) + (3a^{2}b - 2b^{3})\\sqrt{-2} $$\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts with $y + \\sqrt{-2}$, we get a system of two equations:\n$$ y = a^{3} - 6ab^{2} $$\n$$ 1 = 3a^{2}b - 2b^{3} = b(3a^{2} - 2b^{2}) $$\nFrom the second equation, since $a, b$ are integers, $b$ must be a divisor of $1$. So, $b \\in \\{1, -1\\}$.\n\nCase 1: $b=1$.\nThe second equation becomes $1 = 3a^{2} - 2(1)^{2} \\implies 1 = 3a^{2} - 2 \\implies 3a^{2} = 3 \\implies a^{2}=1$. Thus, $a = \\pm 1$.\nIf $a=1, b=1$, then $y = 1^{3} - 6(1)(1)^{2} = 1-6 = -5$.\nWe find the corresponding $x$ value: $x^{3} = y^{2}+2 = (-5)^{2}+2 = 25+2 = 27$, which gives $x=3$.\nSo, $(x,y)=(3, -5)$ is a solution.\nIf $a=-1, b=1$, then $y = (-1)^{3} - 6(-1)(1)^{2} = -1+6 = 5$.\nWe find the corresponding $x$ value: $x^{3} = y^{2}+2 = 5^{2}+2 = 25+2 = 27$, which gives $x=3$.\nSo, $(x,y)=(3, 5)$ is a solution.\n\nCase 2: $b=-1$.\nThe second equation becomes $1 = (-1)(3a^{2} - 2(-1)^{2}) \\implies 1 = -(3a^{2}-2) \\implies 1 = -3a^{2}+2 \\implies 3a^{2}=1$. This equation $a^{2}=1/3$ has no integer solutions for $a$.\n\nTherefore, the only integer solutions for $y^{2}=x^{3}-2$ are $(3, 5)$ and $(3, -5)$. The number of integer points is $N_{-2} = 2$.\n\nPart 2: Determination of $N_{7}$ for the curve $E_{7}: y^{2} = x^{3} + 7$.\n\nWe analyze the equation using modular arithmetic.\nFirst, consider the equation modulo $8$. If $x$ were even, say $x=2m$, then $x^{3} = 8m^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\nThe equation becomes $y^{2} \\equiv 0+7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$.\nThe squares modulo $8$ are $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$. Thus, $y^{2} \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$ has no integer solutions for $y$. So, $x$ must be odd.\n\nNext, consider the equation modulo $4$. Since $x$ is odd, $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ or $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nIf $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, then $x^{3} \\equiv 1^{3} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. The equation becomes $y^{2} \\equiv 1+7 = 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. This is possible (for even $y$).\nIf $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, then $x^{3} \\equiv 3^{3} = 27 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. The equation becomes $y^{2} \\equiv 3+7 = 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. The squares modulo $4$ are $\\{0, 1\\}$. Thus, $y^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ has no solutions.\nTherefore, any integer solution must have $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\nNow we use an algebraic manipulation. We rewrite the equation as:\n$$ y^{2} + 1 = x^{3} + 8 $$\n$$ y^{2} + 1 = (x+2)(x^{2}-2x+4) $$\nFrom elementary growth estimates, for $y^{2} = x^{3}+7$ to have real solutions for $y$, we need $x^{3}+7 \\ge 0$, which implies $x^{3} \\ge -7$. This means $x \\ge -1$.\nCombined with $x$ being odd and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the possible values for $x$ are positive integers $x \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, \\dots\\}$. The value $x=-3$ is ruled out as $x \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. For $x=-1$, $x\\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, ruled out. So we only need to consider $x \\ge 1$ with $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\nFor such $x$, both factors $x+2$ and $x^{2}-2x+4 = (x-1)^{2}+3$ are positive integers.\nLet's analyze the factor $x+2$. Since $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $x+2 \\equiv 1+2 = 3 \\pmod 4$.\nA positive integer that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ must have at least one prime factor $p$ that is also congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, with this prime factor appearing with an odd exponent in its prime factorization.\nLet $p$ be such a prime factor of $x+2$.\nThen $p \\mid (x+2)$, so $p \\mid (x+2)(x^{2}-2x+4) = y^{2}+1$.\nThis implies $y^{2}+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, or $y^{2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$.\nThis means that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. A fundamental result in number theory states that for an odd prime $p$, the congruence $z^{2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ has a solution if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nOur prime $p$ was chosen such that $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This leads to a contradiction. The only way to avoid this contradiction is if $x+2$ has no prime factors, meaning $x+2=1$. This gives $x=-1$, which we have already shown is not a possible value for a solution.\n\nThis argument might have a flaw if the factors $(x+2)$ and $(x^2-2x+4)$ are not coprime. Let $d = \\gcd(x+2, x^{2}-2x+4)$. Then $d$ must divide any linear combination of these two.\n$$ d \\mid (x^{2}-2x+4) - (x-4)(x+2) = (x^2-2x+4) - (x^2-2x-8) = 12 $$\nSince $x$ is odd, $x+2$ is odd, and $x^{2}-2x+4$ is odd. Thus, their gcd, $d$, must be odd. The odd divisors of $12$ are $1$ and $3$.\nCase (a): $d=1$. The factors are coprime. The argument above holds without modification. As $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $x>0$, $x+2>1$ and $x+2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. Thus it must have a prime factor $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, leading to a contradiction. So no solutions in this case.\nCase (b): $d=3$. This occurs if $3 \\mid (x+2)$, which means $x \\equiv -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. If $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $x^{2}-2x+4 \\equiv 1^{2}-2(1)+4=3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, so $3 \\mid (x^{2}-2x+4)$ is consistent. In this case, both factors are divisible by $3$, so their product $y^{2}+1$ is divisible by $9$.\n$y^{2}+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9 \\implies y^{2} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$.\nThe squares modulo $9$ are $\\{0^{2}, (\\pm 1)^{2}, (\\pm 2)^{2}, (\\pm 3)^{2}, (\\pm 4)^{2}\\} \\pmod 9$, which is the set $\\{0, 1, 4, 0, 16\\equiv 7\\}$. The set of quadratic residues mod $9$ is $\\{0,1,4,7\\}$. Since $8$ is not in this set, there are no integer solutions for $y$.\n\nBoth cases lead to no solutions.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the order of the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ for the elliptic curve $E$ given by the equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-2x+1$. We will follow the prescribed steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the primes of bad reduction. The curve is of the form $y^2 = x^3+Ax+B$ with $A = -2$ and $B = 1$. The discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$.\nSubstituting the values of $A$ and $B$:\n$$\n\\Delta = -16(4(-2)^3 + 27(1)^2) = -16(4(-8) + 27) = -16(-32+27) = -16(-5) = 80.\n$$\nThe primes of bad reduction are the prime divisors of $\\Delta$. The prime factorization of $\\Delta = 80$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5$. Thus, the primes of bad reduction are $p=2$ and $p=5$. The primes $p=3$, $p=7$, and $p=11$ do not divide $80$, and are therefore primes of good reduction for $E$.\n\nSecond, we compute the number of points on $E$ over the finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p \\in \\{3, 7, 11\\}$. The total number of points, $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, includes the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nFor $p=3$: We examine $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_3=\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- If $x=0$, $y^2 = 1 \\pmod{3}$. This gives two solutions, $y=1$ and $y=2$. Points: $(0,1), (0,2)$.\n- If $x=1$, $y^2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 \\pmod{3}$. This gives one solution, $y=0$. Point: $(1,0)$.\n- If $x=2$, $y^2 = 8 - 4 + 1 = 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The quadratic residues mod $3$ are $\\{1^2=1, 2^2=1\\}$, so $2$ is not a quadratic residue. There are no solutions for $y$.\nThe number of affine points is $2+1+0=3$. Including the point at infinity, we have $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3) = 3+1 = 4$.\nHasse's bound check: $|\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3) - (p+1)| = |4 - (3+1)| = |0| = 0$. We must have $0 \\le 2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.46$, which is true.\n\nFor $p=7$: We examine $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_7=\\{0, 1, ..., 6\\}$. The quadratic residues mod $7$ are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2\\} = \\{1, 4, 2\\}$.\n- $x=0 \\implies y^2=1$ (QR): $2$ points.\n- $x=1 \\implies y^2=0$: $1$ point.\n- $x=2 \\implies y^2=5$ (NQR): $0$ points.\n- $x=3 \\implies y^2=22 \\equiv 1$ (QR): $2$ points.\n- $x=4 \\implies y^2=57 \\equiv 1$ (QR): $2$ points.\n- $x=5 \\implies y^2=116 \\equiv 4$ (QR): $2$ points.\n- $x=6 \\implies y^2=205 \\equiv 2$ (QR): $2$ points.\nThe number of affine points is $2+1+0+2+2+2+2 = 11$. Including the point at infinity, $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7) = 11+1 = 12$.\nHasse's bound check: $|\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7) - (p+1)| = |12 - (7+1)| = |4| = 4$. We must have $4 \\le 2\\sqrt{7} \\approx 5.29$, which is true.\n\nFor $p=11$: We examine $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{11}$. The quadratic residues mod $11$ are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n- $x=0 \\implies y^2=1$ (QR): $2$ points.\n- $x=1 \\implies y^2=0$: $1$ point.\n- $x=2 \\implies y^2=5$ (QR): $2$ points.\n- $x=3 \\implies y^2=22 \\equiv 0$: $1$ point.\n- $x=4 \\implies y^2=57 \\equiv 2$ (NQR): $0$ points.\n- $x=5 \\implies y^2=116 \\equiv 6$ (NQR): $0$ points.\n- $x=6 \\implies y^2=205 \\equiv 7$ (NQR): $0$ points.\n- $x=7 \\implies y^2=330 \\equiv 0$: $1$ point.\n- $x=8 \\implies y^2=497 \\equiv 2$ (NQR): $0$ points.\n- $x=9 \\implies y^2=712 \\equiv 8$ (NQR): $0$ points.\n- $x=10 \\implies y^2=981 \\equiv 2$ (NQR): $0$ points.\nThe number of affine points is $2+1+2+1+0+0+0+1+0+0+0 = 7$. Including the point at infinity, $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) = 7+1 = 8$.\nHasse's bound check: $|\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) - (p+1)| = |8 - (11+1)| = |-4| = 4$. We must have $4 \\le 2\\sqrt{11} \\approx 6.63$, which is true.\n\nThird, we use these results to bound the order of the torsion subgroup, $m = |E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$. The reduction homomorphism $E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is injective on the subgroup of torsion points whose order is coprime to $p$. Let $T = E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$. Then for a prime $p$ of good reduction, the order of the image of $T$ in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ divides $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. The kernel of this map on $T$ consists of points whose order is a power of $p$.\nA stronger consequence is that for any prime $q$, if $q$ divides $m$, then there is an element of order $q$ in $T$. If $q \\neq p$, this element maps to an element of order $q$ in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, so $q$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$.\n- For $p=3$, any prime factor $q \\neq 3$ of $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3)=4$. So $q=2$.\n- For $p=7$, any prime factor $q \\neq 7$ of $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7)=12=2^2 \\cdot 3$. So $q \\in \\{2,3\\}$.\n- For $p=11$, any prime factor $q \\neq 11$ of $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})=8=2^3$. So $q=2$.\nIf $q=3$ were a prime factor of $m$, then since $3 \\neq 11$, $3$ would have to divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})=8$, which is false. So $m$ is not divisible by $3$. The only possible prime factor of $m$ is $2$. Thus $m$ must be a power of $2$.\nSince $m$ is a power of $2$, its order is coprime to $p$ for $p \\in \\{3, 7, 11\\}$. Therefore, the reduction map is injective on the entire torsion group $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ for each of these primes. This implies that the order $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for each $p$.\n$$\nm \\mid \\gcd(\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3), \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7), \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11}))\n$$\n$$\nm \\mid \\gcd(4, 12, 8) = 4.\n$$\nThe possible orders of the torsion subgroup are $1, 2, 4$.\n\nFourth, we use the Nagell–Lutz theorem to find all rational torsion points. Such points $(x,y)$ must have integer coordinates $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, if $P=(x,y)$ is a torsion point with $y \\neq 0$, then $y^2$ must divide $\\Delta=80$. The square divisors of $80=16 \\cdot 5$ are $1$, $4$, and $16$. We test these possibilities along with the case $y=0$.\n\nCase 1: $y=0$.\nThe equation becomes $x^3-2x+1=0$. By the rational root theorem, any integer root must divide $1$. Testing $x=1$ gives $1^3-2(1)+1 = 0$. So $(1,0)$ is a point on $E$. Points with $y=0$ are of order $2$.\n\nCase 2: $y^2=1$.\nThe equation is $x^3-2x+1=1$, which simplifies to $x^3-2x=0$ or $x(x^2-2)=0$. The only integer solution is $x=0$. This gives two points: $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$.\n\nCase 3: $y^2=4$.\nThe equation is $x^3-2x+1=4$, or $x^3-2x-3=0$. Any integer root must divide $-3$. Testing $x \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 3\\}$:\n- $f(1) = 1-2-3 = -4 \\neq 0$.\n- $f(-1) = -1+2-3 = -2 \\neq 0$.\n- $f(3) = 27-6-3 = 18 \\neq 0$.\n- $f(-3) = -27+6-3 = -24 \\neq 0$.\nThere are no integer solutions for $x$.\n\nCase 4: $y^2=16$.\nThe equation is $x^3-2x+1=16$, or $x^3-2x-15=0$. Any integer root must divide $-15$. Testing $x=3$ gives $3^3-2(3)-15=27-6-15=6 \\neq 0$. No other integer root candidates work either.\n\nThe set of possible torsion points with integer coordinates is therefore $\\{\\mathcal{O}, (1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)\\}$. We check their orders.\nLet $P_1 = (1,0)$. As $y=0$, $P_1$ has order $2$. So $2P_1 = \\mathcal{O}$.\nLet $P_2 = (0,1)$. To find its order, we compute $2P_2$. The slope of the tangent at $P_2$ is $\\lambda = \\frac{3x^2+A}{2y} = \\frac{3(0)^2-2}{2(1)} = -1$.\nThe x-coordinate of $2P_2$ is $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - 2x = (-1)^2 - 2(0) = 1$.\nThe y-coordinate of $2P_2$ is $y_3 = \\lambda(x - x_3) - y = -1(0-1)-1=0$.\nSo, $2P_2 = (1,0) = P_1$.\nThen $4P_2 = 2(2P_2) = 2P_1 = \\mathcal{O}$. Since $2P_2 \\neq \\mathcal{O}$, the order of $P_2=(0,1)$ is $4$. The point $(0,-1)$ is $-P_2$ and also has order $4$.\nThe set of points $\\{\\mathcal{O}, P_2, 2P_2, 3P_2\\} = \\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,1), (1,0), (0,-1)\\}$ forms a cyclic group of order $4$.\nThe Nagell-Lutz search has yielded $4$ torsion points. This implies $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}| \\ge 4$.\n\nCombining our findings:\n1. $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $4$.\n2. We have found $4$ distinct torsion points.\nTherefore, the exact order of the torsion subgroup is $4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3086205"}]}
