The curve has good reduction at a prime $p$ if the reduced curve over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is nonsingular. For primes $p > 2$, this condition is equivalent to $p$ not dividing the discriminant $\\Delta$.\n\nFor the given curve $E: y^{2} = x^{3} - x$, we identify the coefficients as $A = -1$ and $B = 0$.\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\Delta = -16(4(-1)^{3} + 27(0)^{2}) = -16(4(-1) + 0) = -16(-4) = 64 = 2^{6} $$\nThe primes of bad reduction are the prime divisors of $\\Delta$. In this case, the only prime divisor of $\\Delta=64$ is $p=2$.\n\nWe examine each of the specified primes $p \\in \\{5, 7, 11\\}$:\n- For $p=5$: $5$ does not divide $\\Delta=64$.

Therefore, $E$ has good reduction at $p=11$.\n\nIn all three cases, the reduction is good.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $\\#\\tilde{E}(\\mathbb{F}_{p})$**\n\nThe set of points $\\tilde{E}(\\mathbb{F}_{p})$ consists of the point at infinity, which we denote $\\mathcal{O}$, and the affine points $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p} \\times \\mathbb{F}_{p}$ satisfying the curve equation.

This involves computing $p$-adic valuations of its invariants, determining the reduction type using a standard criterion, and then verifying this determination by a direct analysis of the reduced curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$.\n\nThe elliptic curve is given in the short Weierstrass form $y^{2} = x^{3} + Ax + B$, with integer coefficients $A = 2$ and $B = 2$. We are considering reduction modulo the prime $p = 5$, which is not $2$ or $3$.\n\nFirst, we compute the invariants $c_{4}$ and the discriminant $\\Delta$ for this model. The standard formulas for a short Weierstrass equation are:\n$$c_{4} = -48A$$\n$$\\Delta = -16(4A^{3} + 27B^{2})$$\nSubstituting $A = 2$ and $B = 2$, we obtain:\n$$c_{4} = -48(2) = -96$$\n$$\\Delta = -16(4(2)^{3} + 27(2)^{2}) = -16(4 \\cdot 8 + 27 \\cdot 4) = -16(32 + 108) = -16(140)$$\nTo compute the $5$-adic valuations, $v_{5}(\\cdot)$, we find the prime factorizations of $c_{4}$ and $\\Delta$:\n$$c_{4} = -96 = -1 \\cdot 2^{5} \\cdot 3$$\n$$\\Delta = -16 \\cdot 140 = -(2^{4}) \\cdot (14 \\cdot 10) = -(2^{4}) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 7) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 5) = -1 \\cdot 2^{6} \\cdot 5^{1} \\cdot 7^{1}$$\nThe $p$-adic valuation $v_{p}(n)$ of an integer $n$ is the exponent of the highest power of the prime $p$ that divides $n$.

In this equation, the lowest degree is $2$. The equation for the tangent cone is:\n$$Y^{2} \\equiv 3X^{2} \\pmod{5}$$\nThis can be written as $Y^{2} - 3X^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. A singularity is a node (corresponding to multiplicative reduction) if this equation factors into two distinct linear forms over the algebraic closure of the field, $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_{5}}$. The equation factors if and only if $3$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$. The non-zero quadratic residues in $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ are $1^{2} \\equiv 1$ and $2^{2} \\equiv 4$. Since $3$ is not a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$, the tangent lines are not defined over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$. However, over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_{5}}$, we can find an element $\\sqrt{3}$ such that $(\\sqrt{3})^{2} = 3$. Then the equation for the tangent cone factors as:\n$(Y - \\sqrt{3}X)(Y + \\sqrt{3}X) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$\nThis corresponds to two distinct tangent lines, $Y = \\sqrt{3}X$ and $Y = -\\sqrt{3}X$.

The existence of two distinct tangent lines at the singular point confirms that the singularity is a node. This type of singular cubic is called a nodal cubic, which corresponds to multiplicative reduction.

Both $A$ and $B$ are integers as required.\n\nNext, we verify that $E$ has good reduction at $p=5$. The discriminant of an elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form is given by $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$.

This count includes the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. We need to find all pairs $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{F}_5 \\times \\mathbb{F}_5$ that satisfy the equation. The field is $\\mathbb{F}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. First, we find the quadratic residues modulo $5$. The squares are $0^2=0$, $1^2=1$, $2^2=4$, $3^2=9\\equiv 4$, and $4^2=16\\equiv 1$. Thus, the set of quadratic residues is $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\nWe now test each possible value of $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_5$:\n- For $x=0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 1 = 1$. Since $1$ is a quadratic residue, there are two solutions for $y$: $y=1$ and $y=4$. This gives two points: $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 4)$.\n- For $x=1$: $y^2 = 1^3 + 1 = 2$. Since $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $5$, there are no solutions for $y$.\n- For $x=2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 1 = 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. Since $4$ is a quadratic residue, there are two solutions for $y$: $y=2$ and $y=3$. This gives two points: $(2, 2)$ and $(2, 3)$.\n- For $x=3$: $y^2 = 3^3 + 1 = 28 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. Since $3$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $5$, there are no solutions for $y$.\n- For $x=4$: $y^2 = 4^3 + 1 = 65 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. This has one solution for $y$: $y=0$. This gives one point: $(4, 0)$.\n\nSumming up the affine points, we have $2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 5$ points. The total number of points on $\\tilde{E}$ is the number of affine points plus the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$.\n$$\\#\\tilde{E}(\\mathbb{F}_5) = 5 + 1 = 6$$\n\nWith the number of points determined, we can compute the Frobenius trace $a_p$ for $p=5$. The formula is:\n$$a_p = p + 1 - \\#\\tilde{E}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$$\nSubstituting the values for our case:\n$$a_5 = 5 + 1 - \\#\\tilde{E}(\\mathbb{F}_5) = 6 - 6 = 0$$\n\nFinally, we use the standard supersingular criterion for primes $p \\geq 5$. The problem states that this criterion is $a_p = 0$. Since we are working with $p=5$ and we have computed $a_5 = 0$, the curve $\\tilde{E}: y^2 = x^3 + 1$ is indeed supersingular over $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n\nAll conditions of the problem have been met. We have constructed a suitable curve $E$, shown it has good reduction at $p=5$, reduced it, counted the points on the reduced curve, and computed the Frobenius trace $a_5$, which confirms its supersingularity. The value of the Frobenius trace is $a_5=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3089622"}]}
