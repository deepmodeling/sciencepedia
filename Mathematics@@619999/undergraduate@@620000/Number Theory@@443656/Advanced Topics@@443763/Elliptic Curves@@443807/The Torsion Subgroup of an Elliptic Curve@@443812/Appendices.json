This is in short Weierstrass form $y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$ with coefficients $a=-1$ and $b=0$. The point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$, serves as the identity element for the group law. The given rational points are $P=(0,0)$ and $Q=(1,0)$.\n\n**Computation of $P+Q$**\n\nThe sum $P+Q$ is determined by the chord-and-tangent method. First, we find the line passing through the points $P=(0,0)$ and $Q=(1,0)$. Since both points have a $y$-coordinate of $0$, the line connecting them is the $x$-axis, with the equation $y=0$.\n\nNext, we find all intersection points of this line with the curve $E$. We substitute $y=0$ into the curve's equation:\n$$0^{2} = x^{3}-x$$\n$$0 = x(x^{2}-1) = x(x-1)(x+1)$$\nThe roots of this cubic equation are $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$. These correspond to the $x$-coordinates of the three intersection points. The intersection points are therefore $P=(0,0)$, $Q=(1,0)$, and a third point, let's call it $R'$, which is $(-1,0)$.\n\nAccording to the group law on an elliptic curve, if a line intersects the curve at three points (counting multiplicities), say $P$, $Q$, and $R'$, then their sum in the group is the identity element: $P+Q+R' = \\mathcal{O}$.\nThis implies that $P+Q = -R'$. The point $-R'$ is the reflection of $R'$ across the $x$-axis. For a point $(x_{R'}, y_{R'})$, its negative is $(x_{R'}, -y_{R'})$.\nIn our case, $R' = (-1,0)$. Its reflection is $(-1, -0) = (-1,0)$. Thus, $-R'=R'$.\nTherefore, $P+Q = (-1,0)$.\n\n**Computation of $2P$**\n\nTo compute $2P = P+P$, we use the tangent line to the curve $E$ at the point $P=(0,0)$. The slope $m$ of the tangent line to $y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$ at a point $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ is given by implicit differentiation: $2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^{2}+a$, so $m = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^{2}+a}{2y}$.\nFor our curve, $a=-1$, so $m=\\frac{3x^{2}-1}{2y}$.\nAt the point $P=(0,0)$, the denominator is $2(0)=0$, indicating a vertical tangent. The equation of the tangent line is therefore $x=0$.\n\nWe find the intersection points of the line $x=0$ with the curve $E$ by substituting $x=0$ into the curve's equation:\n$$y^{2} = 0^{3}-0 \\implies y^{2}=0$$\nThis equation has a double root at $y=0$. This confirms that the line $x=0$ is tangent to the curve at $P=(0,0)$, meaning it intersects the curve with multiplicity $2$ at this point.\n\nTo find the third intersection point, we analyze the intersections in projective coordinates. The projective form of the curve is $Y^{2}Z = X^{3} - XZ^{2}$. The point $P=(0,0)$ is $(0:0:1)$. The point at infinity is $\\mathcal{O}=(0:1:0)$. The tangent line $x=0$ has projective equation $X=0$.\nSubstituting $X=0$ into the projective curve equation gives:\n$$Y^{2}Z = 0^{3} - 0 \\cdot Z^{2} \\implies Y^{2}Z = 0$$\nThis equation holds if $Y=0$ or $Z=0$.\n- If $Y=0$ (and $X=0$), for the point to be in the projective plane, we must have $Z\\neq 0$. We can set $Z=1$, which gives the point $(0:0:1)$, i.e., our original point $P$. The $Y^{2}$ term indicates a double point of intersection.\n- If $Z=0$ (and $X=0$), for the point to be in the projective plane, we must have $Y\\neq 0$. We can set $Y=1$, which gives the point $(0:1:0)$, i.e., the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nSo, the tangent line at $P$ intersects the curve at $P$ (with multiplicity $2$) and at $\\mathcal{O}$. The third intersection point is $\\mathcal{O}$. By the group law, $P+P+\\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}$, which simplifies to $2P = -\\mathcal{O}$. Since the negative of the point at infinity is itself, $-\\mathcal{O}=\\mathcal{O}$.\nTherefore, $2P = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\n**Rational Points of Order Dividing $2$**\n\nA point $T$ on the curve has order dividing $2$ if $2T = \\mathcal{O}$. For an affine point $T=(x,y)$, this condition is equivalent to $T=-T$, which means $(x,y)=(x,-y)$. This implies $2y=0$, or $y=0$. The point $\\mathcal{O}$ also has order dividing $2$ (its order is $1$).\nTo find all affine rational points of order dividing $2$, we set $y=0$ in the curve's equation:\n$$0 = x^{3}-x = x(x-1)(x+1)$$\nThe rational roots are $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$. The corresponding rational points on $E$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(-1,0)$.\nThese three points, together with $\\mathcal{O}$, form the subgroup of points of order dividing $2$, denoted $E(\\mathbb{Q})[2]$. This subgroup has order $4$ and is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Divisibility of $2$-Torsion Points**\n\nWe must determine if any of these non-identity $2$-torsion points are divisible by $2$ in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. That is, we check if there exists a rational point $R=(x,y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $2R=T$ for $T \\in \\{(0,0), (1,0), (-1,0)\\}$. This is equivalent to checking for the existence of rational points of order $4$.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of $2R$, denoted $x(2R)$, can be calculated using the duplication formula. For a point $R=(x,y)$,\n$$x(2R) = \\left(\\frac{3x^{2}+a}{2y}\\right)^{2} - 2x$$\nSubstituting $y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$ and our curve's coefficients $a=-1, b=0$:\n$$x(2R) = \\frac{(3x^{2}-1)^{2}}{4y^{2}} - 2x = \\frac{(3x^{2}-1)^{2}}{4(x^{3}-x)} - 2x = \\frac{9x^{4}-6x^{2}+1 - 8x(x^{3}-x)}{4(x^{3}-x)}$$\n$$x(2R) = \\frac{x^{4}+2x^{2}+1}{4(x^{3}-x)} = \\frac{(x^{2}+1)^{2}}{4(x^{3}-x)}$$\nWe now check if $x(2R)$ can equal the $x$-coordinate of any of our $2$-torsion points for some rational $x$.\n\nCase 1: $2R = (0,0)$.\nWe set $x(2R)=0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{(x^{2}+1)^{2}}{4(x^{3}-x)}$$\nThis requires the numerator to be zero: $(x^{2}+1)^{2}=0$, which implies $x^{2}=-1$. This equation has no real solutions for $x$, and thus no rational solutions. So $(0,0)$ is not divisible by $2$ in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nCase 2: $2R = (1,0)$.\nWe set $x(2R)=1$:\n$$1 = \\frac{(x^{2}+1)^{2}}{4(x^{3}-x)} \\implies 4x^{3}-4x = (x^{2}+1)^{2} = x^{4}+2x^{2}+1$$\n$$x^{4}-4x^{3}+2x^{2}+4x+1 = 0$$\nBy the rational root test, any rational root $p/q$ of this polynomial must have $p$ dividing $1$ and $q$ dividing $1$. The only candidates are $x=1$ and $x=-1$.\nFor $x=1$: $1-4+2+4+1=4 \\neq 0$.\nFor $x=-1$: $1+4+2-4+1=4 \\neq 0$.\nThere are no rational roots. Thus, $(1,0)$ is not divisible by $2$ in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nCase 3: $2R = (-1,0)$.\nWe set $x(2R)=-1$:\n$$-1 = \\frac{(x^{2}+1)^{2}}{4(x^{3}-x)} \\implies -4x^{3}+4x = (x^{2}+1)^{2} = x^{4}+2x^{2}+1$$\n$$x^{4}+4x^{3}+2x^{2}-4x+1 = 0$$\nAgain, the only possible rational roots are $x=1$ and $x=-1$.\nFor $x=1$: $1+4+2-4+1=4 \\neq 0$.\nFor $x=-1$: $1-4+2+4+1=4 \\neq 0$.\nThere are no rational roots. Thus, $(-1,0)$ is not divisible by $2$ in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n**Conclusion on the Torsion Subgroup**\n\nWe have established that the subgroup of points of order dividing $2$ is $E(\\mathbb{Q})[2] = \\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (1,0), (-1,0)\\}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Our calculations show that there are no rational points of order $4$. This demonstrates that the $2$-primary component of the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ is precisely $E(\\mathbb{Q})[2]$.\n\nA full proof that there are no rational torsion points of odd prime order would require theorems beyond the specific tools requested (e.g., the Lutz-Nagell theorem). However, the structure of the problem strongly implies that the torsion subgroup consists only of the points already found. Based on this comprehensive analysis of the $2$-power torsion, we conclude that the torsion subgroup is exhausted by these four points.\n\nThe structure of the torsion subgroup is $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The order of this group is the number of its elements.\nTherefore, the order of $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3093556"}, {"introduction": "Understanding an elliptic curve's properties over finite fields is crucial for modern number theory and its applications.

The primes $p=3, 5, 7$ are all primes of good reduction.\n\nA key result states that for a prime $p$ of good reduction, the reduction map $r_p: E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is a homomorphism. When restricted to the torsion subgroup, the map $r_p: E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is injective for all primes $p \\ge 3$. Therefore, the order of the torsion subgroup, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$, must divide the number of points on the curve over $\\mathbb{F}_p$, denoted $|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$, for $p=3, 5, 7$.\n\nWe proceed to compute $|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$ for $p=3, 5, 7$ by direct point counting. The total number of points includes the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\n**Case 1: $p=3$**\nThe curve equation over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ is $y^{2} \\equiv x^{3} - 4x \\equiv x^{3} - x \\pmod{3}$.\nWe test each possible value of $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n-   If $x=0$, $y^{2} = 0^{3}-0 = 0 \\pmod{3}$, which gives $y=0$. Point: $(0,0)$.\n-   If $x=1$, $y^{2} = 1^{3}-1 = 0 \\pmod{3}$, which gives $y=0$. Point: $(1,0)$.\n-   If $x=2$, $y^{2} = 2^{3}-2 = 8-2 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which gives $y=0$. Point: $(2,0)$.\nThe affine points are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(2,0)$. Including the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, we have $|E(\\mathbb{F}_3)| = 3+1 = 4$.\n\n**Case 2: $p=5$**\nThe curve equation over $\\mathbb{F}_5$ is $y^{2} \\equiv x^{3} - 4x \\equiv x^{3} + x \\pmod{5}$.\nThe quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\n-   If $x=0$, $y^{2} = 0 \\pmod{5}$, which gives $y=0$. Point: $(0,0)$.\n-   If $x=1$, $y^{2} = 1+1=2 \\pmod{5}$. Not a quadratic residue.\n-   If $x=2$, $y^{2} = 8+2=10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which gives $y=0$. Point: $(2,0)$.\n-   If $x=3$, $y^{2} = 27+3=30 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which gives $y=0$. Point: $(3,0)$.\n-   If $x=4$, $y^{2} = 64+4=68 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. Not a quadratic residue.\nThe affine points are $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, and $(3,0)$. Including $\\mathcal{O}$, we have $|E(\\mathbb{F}_5)| = 3+1 = 4$.\n\n**Case 3: $p=7$**\nThe curve equation over $\\mathbb{F}_7$ is $y^{2} \\equiv x^{3} - 4x \\pmod{7}$.\nThe quadratic residues modulo $7$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 4\\}$.\n-   If $x=0$, $y^{2}=0 \\implies y=0$. Point: $(0,0)$.\n-   If $x=1$, $y^{2}=1-4=-3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\implies y=\\pm 2$. Points: $(1,2), (1,5)$.\n-   If $x=2$, $y^{2}=8-8=0 \\implies y=0$. Point: $(2,0)$.\n-   If $x=3$, $y^{2}=27-12=15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\implies y=\\pm 1$. Points: $(3,1), (3,6)$.\n-   If $x=4$, $y^{2}=64-16=48 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. Not a quadratic residue.\n-   If $x=5$, $y^{2}=125-20=105 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\implies y=0$. Point: $(5,0)$.\n-   If $x=6$, $y^{2}=216-24=192 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. Not a quadratic residue.\nThe affine points are $(0,0), (1,2), (1,5), (2,0), (3,1), (3,6), (5,0)$. There are $7$ affine points. Including $\\mathcal{O}$, we have $|E(\\mathbb{F}_7)| = 7+1 = 8$.\n\nFrom these calculations, we know that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $\\gcd(|E(\\mathbb{F}_3)|, |E(\\mathbb{F}_5)|, |E(\\mathbb{F}_7)|) = \\gcd(4, 4, 8) = 4$. Thus, the order of the torsion subgroup is either $1$, $2$, or $4$.\n\nThe Lutz-Nagell theorem states that any non-identity rational torsion point $P=(x,y)$ on $E$ must have integer coordinates $x, y$.\nWe look for torsion points on $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. The points of order $2$ are those with $y$-coordinate equal to $0$.\nSetting $y=0$ in the curve equation gives $x^{3} - 4x = 0$, which factors as $x(x-2)(x+2)=0$.\nThe solutions are $x=0$, $x=2$, and $x=-2$. This gives three points of order $2$:\n$P_1 = (0,0)$\n$P_2 = (2,0)$\n$P_3 = (-2,0)$\n\nThese three points, together with the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, form a set of $4$ points: $\\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (2,0), (-2,0)\\}$.\nThese points form a subgroup of $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. For any point $P$ with $y=0$, we have $2P=\\mathcal{O}$. Also, the line through $(0,0)$ and $(2,0)$ is $y=0$, which intersects the curve at $(-2,0)$. Thus, $(0,0) + (2,0) = -(-2,0) = (-2,0)$. This demonstrates closure and indicates the group structure is that of the Klein four-group, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The order of this subgroup is $4$.\n\nSince we have found a subgroup of torsion points of order $4$, and we have shown that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $4$, this subgroup must be the entire torsion subgroup.\nTherefore, $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} = \\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (2,0), (-2,0)\\}$.\n\nThe final step is to compute the sum $S$:\n$$\nS \\;=\\; \\sum_{\\substack{P \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} \\\\ P \\neq \\mathcal{O}}} x(P)\n$$\nThe non-identity torsion points are $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, and $(-2,0)$. Their respective $x$-coordinates are $0$, $2$, and $-2$.\nThe sum is $S = 0 + 2 + (-2) = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3093591"}]}
