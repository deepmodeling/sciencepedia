The curve is given in the short Weierstrass form $y^{2} = x^{3} + ax + b$ with rational coefficients $a = -4$ and $b = 1$. The discriminant of the curve is $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$.

Computation of $2P = (x_{2P}, y_{2P})$**\n\nTo compute $2P = P+P$, we use the point doubling formula. Let $P = (x_1, y_1)$. The coordinates of $2P = (x_3, y_3)$ are given by:\n$$\nx_3 = m^2 - 2x_1\n$$\n$$\ny_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at $P$. The slope is found by implicit differentiation of the curve's equation, $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$:\n$$\n2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + a \\implies m = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}\n$$\nFor our point $P = (2, 1)$ and curve parameters $a = -4$, $b=1$, the slope $m$ is:\n$$\nm = \\frac{3(2)^2 + (-4)}{2(1)} = \\frac{3(4) - 4}{2} = \\frac{12 - 4}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n$$\nNow we can compute the coordinates of $2P$:\n$$\nx_{2P} = m^2 - 2x_1 = 4^2 - 2(2) = 16 - 4 = 12\n$$\n$$\ny_{2P} = m(x_1 - x_{2P}) - y_1 = 4(2 - 12) - 1 = 4(-10) - 1 = -40 - 1 = -41\n$$\nThus, the point $2P$ is $(12, -41)$.\n\n**2. Computation of $3P = (x_{3P}, y_{3P})$**\n\nTo compute $3P$, we add the points $P$ and $2P$. This is a point addition operation, $3P = P + 2P$. Let $P_1 = P = (x_1, y_1) = (2, 1)$ and $P_2 = 2P = (x_2, y_2) = (12, -41)$.

This implies that if we write $M = M_{p'} M_{p''}$, where $M_{p'}$ is the $p$-part of $M$ and $M_{p''}$ is the part of $M$ coprime to $p$, then $M_{p''}$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. We use this for $p=5, 7, 11$.\n\nLet the prime factorization of $M$ be $M = 2^{v_2} 3^{v_3} 5^{v_5} 7^{v_7} \\dots$.\n\n1.  For $p=5$, we have $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_5) = 9 = 3^2$. The part of $M$ coprime to $5$ must divide $9$.\n    $$ M/5^{v_5} \\mid 3^2 $$\n    This implies that the only prime factors of $M/5^{v_5}$ can be $3$. Therefore, $v_2 = 0$, $v_7 = 0$, $v_{11} = 0$, etc., for any prime other than $3$ and $5$. Also, the exponent of $3$ must satisfy $v_3 \\le 2$.\n\n2.  For $p=7$, we have $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7) = 12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. The part of $M$ coprime to $7$ must divide $12$.\n    $$ M/7^{v_7} \\mid 2^2 \\cdot 3 $$\n    This implies that the only prime factors of $M/7^{v_7}$ can be $2$ and $3$. Therefore, $v_5 = 0$, $v_{11} = 0$, etc., for any prime other than $2, 3, 7$. The exponents of $2$ and $3$ must satisfy $v_2 \\le 2$ and $v_3 \\le 1$.\n\n3.  For $p=11$, we have $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) = 15 = 3 \\cdot 5$. The part of $M$ coprime to $11$ must divide $15$.\n    $$ M/11^{v_{11}} \\mid 3 \\cdot 5 $$\n    This implies that the only prime factors of $M/11^{v_{11}}$ can be $3$ and $5$. Therefore, $v_2 = 0$, $v_7 = 0$, etc., for any prime other than $3, 5, 11$. The exponents of $3$ and $5$ must satisfy $v_3 \\le 1$ and $v_5 \\le 1$.\n\nWe combine these constraints on the exponents $v_q$ in the prime factorization of $M$:\n- $v_2$: From $p=5$ and $p=11$, we must have $v_2 = 0$.\n- $v_5$: From $p=7$, we must have $v_5 = 0$.\n- $v_7$: From $p=5$ (or $p=11$), we must have $v_7 = 0$.\n- $v_{11}$: From $p=5$ (or $p=7$), we must have $v_{11} = 0$.\n- For any other prime $q \\notin \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\\}$, all three reductions imply $v_q=0$.\n\nThe only possible non-zero exponent is $v_3$. Now we combine the constraints on $v_3$:\n- From $p=5$: $v_3 \\le 2$.\n- From $p=7$: $v_3 \\le 1$.\n- From $p=11$: $v_3 \\le 1$.\n\nTo satisfy all conditions simultaneously, we must have $v_3 \\le \\min(2, 1, 1) = 1$.\nTherefore, the order of the torsion subgroup $M$ must have $v_q = 0$ for all primes $q \\ne 3$, and $v_3 \\le 1$. This means $M$ must divide $3^1 = 3$. The possible orders for the torsion subgroup are $1$ and $3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the strongest possible integer $N$ such that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ divides $N$. This is the least common multiple of all possible orders for the torsion group that are consistent with our data. The set of possible orders is $\\{1, 3\\}$.

From the third equation, $2y=0$, we deduce $y=0$. We verify that the point $(0,0)$ lies on the curve by substituting into the first equation: $0^2 - 0^3 = 0$. Thus, the unique singular point of $C$ is the origin, $(0,0)$.\n\nTo classify the nature of this singularity, we analyze the tangent cone at $(0,0)$. The tangent cone is defined by the lowest-degree homogeneous component of the defining polynomial $f(x,y) = y^2 - x^3$. The term $y^2$ has degree $2$, and the term $-x^3$ has degree $3$. The lowest-degree homogeneous component is $y^2$.\nThe equation for the tangent cone is therefore $y^2=0$. This equation represents the line $y=0$ with multiplicity $2$.\n\nA singular point is classified as a node if the tangent cone consists of two or more distinct lines. It is classified as a cusp if the tangent cone consists of a single line with multiplicity greater than one. Since the tangent cone at $(0,0)$ is the single line $y=0$ with multiplicity $2$, the singularity at $(0,0)$ is a cusp. The unique tangent line to $C$ at this singular point is the line $L$ defined by $y=0$.\n\n**2.

A generic line through the origin can be written as $y=tx$ for a parameter $t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which represents the slope of the line. The parameter $t$ can be interpreted as the rational function $t = y/x$ defined on $C$ everywhere except the origin.\n\nWe find the intersection points of the line $y=tx$ and the curve $C$ by substituting $y=tx$ into the equation of the curve $y^2=x^3$:\n$$ (tx)^2 = x^3 $$\n$$ t^2 x^2 = x^3 $$\n$$ x^3 - t^2 x^2 = 0 $$\n$$ x^2(x - t^2) = 0 $$\nThis equation gives the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points. The solution $x=0$ has multiplicity $2$, which corresponds to the singular point $(0,0)$. The other intersection point has $x$-coordinate $x=t^2$.\nThe corresponding $y$-coordinate is found by substituting this $x$ value back into the equation of the line $y=tx$:\n$$ y = t(t^2) = t^3 $$\nThus, for each rational value of $t$, we obtain a point $(x(t), y(t)) = (t^2, t^3)$ on the curve $C$.\n\nWe must show that this parameterization covers all rational points on $C$. Let $(x_0, y_0)$ be a rational point on $C$, so $x_0, y_0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $y_0^2 = x_0^3$.\nIf $(x_0, y_0) = (0,0)$, we can obtain this point by setting our parameter $t=0$, which gives $(0^2, 0^3)=(0,0)$.\nIf $(x_0, y_0) \\neq (0,0)$, then $x_0 \\neq 0$ (since $x_0=0$ implies $y_0=0$). We can define a rational number $t_0 = y_0/x_0$. Let us show that this $t_0$ generates the point $(x_0, y_0)$.\nFrom $y_0^2 = x_0^3$, since $x_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $x_0^2$:\n$$ \\frac{y_0^2}{x_0^2} = x_0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{y_0}{x_0}\\right)^2 = x_0 $$\n$$ t_0^2 = x_0 $$\nNow, for the $y$-coordinate:\n$$ y_0 = t_0 x_0 = t_0(t_0^2) = t_0^3 $$\nSo, any rational point $(x_0, y_0)$ on $C$ can be written as $(t^2, t^3)$ for some $t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The parameterization is given by $(x(t), y(t)) = (t^2, t^3)$.\n\n**3. Intersection Multiplicity**\n\nWe need to compute the intersection multiplicity $I_{(0,0)}(C,L)$ of the curve $C: y^2-x^3=0$ and its tangent line $L: y=0$ at the origin $(0,0)$. This multiplicity is defined as the dimension of a quotient of the local ring of the affine plane at the origin.\nLet $\\mathcal{O}_{(0,0)} = \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ be the local ring of $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ at the maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}=(x,y)$. The intersection multiplicity is given by:\n$$ I_{(0,0)}(C,L) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\left( \\frac{\\mathcal{O}_{(0,0)}}{(y^2 - x^3, y)} \\right) $$\nwhere $(y^2 - x^3, y)$ denotes the ideal generated by the defining polynomials of $C$ and $L$ in $\\mathcal{O}_{(0,0)}$.\nWe can simplify the ideal. Since $y$ is a generator of the ideal, any multiple of $y$, such as $y^2$, is also in the ideal. Therefore, we can simplify the first generator:\n$$ (y^2 - x^3, y) = (y^2 - x^3 - y^2, y) = (-x^3, y) = (x^3, y) $$\nSo, we need to compute the dimension of the following vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$ I = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\left( \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]_{(x,y)}}{(x^3, y)} \\right) $$\nThe quotient of the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ by the ideal $(x^3, y)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]}{(x^3, y)} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/(y)}{(x^3,y)/(y)} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x]}{(x^3)} $$\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3)$ is the ring of polynomials in $x$ modulo $x^3$. An element in this ring is represented uniquely by a polynomial of degree less than $3$, of the form $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$ where $a_0, a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis ring is a local ring with its unique maximal ideal being $(x)/(x^3)$. Localizing this ring at its maximal ideal does not change the ring. Therefore,\n$$ \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]_{(x,y)}}{(x^3, y)} \\cong \\left( \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]}{(x^3, y)} \\right)_{(x,y)} \\cong \\left( \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x]}{(x^3)} \\right)_{(x)} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}[x]}{(x^3)} $$\nWe now find the dimension of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3)$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A basis for this space is given by the set of equivalence classes of $\\{1, x, x^2\\}$. The dimension is the number of basis vectors, which is $3$.\nThus, the intersection multiplicity is $I_{(0,0)}(C,L) = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the parameterization functions $x(t) = t^2$, $y(t) = t^3$, and the intersection multiplicity $I=3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} t^2 & t^3 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3089333"}]}
