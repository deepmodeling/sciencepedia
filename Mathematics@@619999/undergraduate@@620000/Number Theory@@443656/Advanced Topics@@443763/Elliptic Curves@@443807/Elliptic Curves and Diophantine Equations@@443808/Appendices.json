We are given two points $P = (x_P, y_P) = (2, 1)$ and $Q = (x_Q, y_Q) = (-1, 2)$ on $E$. We need to compute their sum $P+Q$.\n\nAccording to the chord-and-tangent law, we first find the equation of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$. The slope $m$ of this line is:\n$$ m = \\frac{y_Q - y_P}{x_Q - x_P} = \\frac{2 - 1}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{1}{-3} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe equation of the line is given by $y - y_P = m(x - x_P)$, which is:\n$$ y - 1 = -\\frac{1}{3}(x - 2) $$\n$$ y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{2}{3} + 1 = -\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{5}{3} $$\n\nTo find the points of intersection of this line with the elliptic curve $E$, we substitute the expression for $y$ into the curve's equation:\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{9}( -x + 5 )^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{9}(x^2 - 10x + 25) = x^3 - 4x + 1 $$\nMultiplying by $9$ to clear the fraction:\n$$ x^2 - 10x + 25 = 9x^3 - 36x + 9 $$\nRearranging the terms to form a standard cubic equation:\n$$ 9x^3 - x^2 - 26x - 16 = 0 $$\nDividing by $9$ to make the leading coefficient $1$:\n$$ x^3 - \\frac{1}{9}x^2 - \\frac{26}{9}x - \\frac{16}{9} = 0 $$\nThe roots of this cubic equation are the $x$-coordinates of the three intersection points of the line and the curve. We already know two of these roots: $x_P = 2$ and $x_Q = -1$. Let the third intersection point be $R'=(x_{R'}, y_{R'})$. Its $x$-coordinate, $x_{R'}$, is the third root.\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a monic cubic $x^3+ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-a$. In our case, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $-\\frac{1}{9}$.\n$$ x_P + x_Q + x_{R'} = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{9}\\right) = \\frac{1}{9} $$\nSubstituting the known values for $x_P$ and $x_Q$:\n$$ 2 + (-1) + x_{R'} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\n$$ 1 + x_{R'} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\n$$ x_{R'} = \\frac{1}{9} - 1 = \\frac{1-9}{9} = -\\frac{8}{9} $$\nAlternatively, for a Weierstrass equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points is given by $x_P + x_Q + x_{R'} = m^2$. Here, $A=-4$ and $B=1$. Let's verify this commonly used formula.\nFrom $(m(x-x_P)+y_P)^2 = x^3+Ax+B$, we get $m^2x^2 + \\dots = x^3+Ax+B$, which means $x^3 - m^2x^2 + \\dots = 0$. The sum of the roots is $x_P+x_Q+x_{R'} = m^2$.\nUsing our calculated slope $m = -\\frac{1}{3}$:\n$$ x_{R'} = m^2 - x_P - x_Q = \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - 2 - (-1) = \\frac{1}{9} - 2 + 1 = \\frac{1}{9} - 1 = -\\frac{8}{9} $$\nBoth methods yield the same result for $x_{R'}$.\n\nNow, we find the $y$-coordinate, $y_{R'}$, by substituting $x_{R'}$ into the line equation:\n$$ y_{R'} = -\\frac{1}{3}x_{R'} + \\frac{5}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\left(-\\frac{8}{9}\\right) + \\frac{5}{3} $$\n$$ y_{R'} = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{5 \\cdot 9}{3 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{45}{27} = \\frac{53}{27} $$\nSo the third intersection point is $R' = \\left(-\\frac{8}{9}, \\frac{53}{27}\\right)$.\n\nThe sum $P+Q$ is defined as the reflection of $R'$ across the $x$-axis. This means that $P+Q$ has the same $x$-coordinate as $R'$ but the negative of its $y$-coordinate. Let $P+Q = (x_{P+Q}, y_{P+Q})$.\n$$ x_{P+Q} = x_{R'} = -\\frac{8}{9} $$\n$$ y_{P+Q} = -y_{R'} = -\\frac{53}{27} $$\nTherefore, the sum of the points $P$ and $Q$ is $\\left(-\\frac{8}{9}, -\\frac{53}{27}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{8}{9} & -\\frac{53}{27} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3084717"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to add two different points, a natural question arises: what happens when we add a point to itself?

Computation of $2P$**\n\nThe point $2P$ is defined as the sum $P+P$. To compute this sum, we must use the tangent line method. The group law states that if the tangent line to the curve at $P$ intersects the curve at a third point $R'$, then $P+P = -R'$, where $-R'$ is the reflection of $R'$ across the $x$-axis. If $R'=(x', y')$, then $-R' = (x', -y')$.\n\nFirst, we find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at $P=(0,0)$.

The slope is undefined, which indicates that the tangent line is a vertical line. The equation of the vertical line passing through $(0,0)$ is $x=0$.\n\nNext, we find the intersection points of this tangent line, $x=0$, with the elliptic curve $E$. We substitute $x=0$ into the curve's equation:\n$$\ny^{2} = (0)^{3}+0 \\implies y^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis equation has a double root at $y=0$. This confirms that the line $x=0$ is indeed tangent to the curve at the point $(0,0)$.\n\nIn the projective plane where elliptic curves are defined, a vertical line $x=c$ intersects the curve at two finite points $(c, y_c)$ and $(c, -y_c)$ and the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. When the line is tangent, two of these intersection points coincide. In our case, the line $x=0$ is tangent to the curve at $P=(0,0)$. The two finite intersection points have coalesced into one point with multiplicity two. Therefore, the three intersection points of the line $x=0$ and the curve $E$ are $P=(0,0)$ (with multiplicity two) and the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nAccording to the group law for adding a point to itself, the third intersection point is $R' = \\mathcal{O}$. The sum $2P$ is the inverse of this point:\n$$\n2P = -R' = -\\mathcal{O}\n$$\nThe inverse of the point at infinity is the point at infinity itself.
