It is scientifically grounded in the theory of elliptic curves, a well-established area of number theory. All provided data is self-consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The elliptic curve $E$ given by $y^{2}=x^{3}-4x+1$ is non-singular, as its discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$ for $a=-4$ and $b=1$ is $\\Delta = -16(4(-4)^3 + 27(1)^2) = -16(-256+27) = 3664 \\neq 0$. The given points $P=(0,1)$ and $Q=(2,1)$ are verified to lie on the curve: for $P$, $1^2 = 1$ and $0^3-4(0)+1=1$; for $Q$, $1^2=1$ and $2^3-4(2)+1=8-8+1=1$. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe task is to derive the formula for the sum of two distinct points on an elliptic curve from first principles and then apply it. The group law on an elliptic curve, known as the chord-and-tangent method, defines the sum of two points $P$ and $Q$. The procedure is as follows:\n$1$. Draw a line $L$ through the points $P$ and $Q$.\n$2$. Due to Bézout's theorem, this line will intersect the cubic curve at a third point, which we shall call $R$. If the points are rational, this third intersection point will also be rational.\n$3$. The sum $P+Q$ is defined as the reflection of the point $R$ across the $x$-axis.\n\nLet us formalize this process algebraically for a general elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form, $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$. Let $P=(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q=(x_2, y_2)$ be two distinct points on the curve, with $x_1 \\neq x_2$.\n\nThe line $L$ passing through $P$ and $Q$ has a slope $m$ given by:\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\nThe equation of the line $L$ is $y = m(x-x_1) + y_1$.\n\nTo find the intersection points of $L$ and the curve $E$, we substitute the expression for $y$ into the curve's equation:\n$$(m(x-x_1) + y_1)^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\nExpanding the left-hand side gives a polynomial in $x$. However, a more direct approach is to substitute $y=mx+c$, where $c=y_1-mx_1$, into the general curve equation:\n$$(mx+c)^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\n$$m^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\nRearranging the terms to form a monic cubic polynomial in $x$:\n$$x^3 - m^2x^2 + (a - 2mc)x + (b - c^2) = 0$$\nThe roots of this cubic equation are the $x$-coordinates of the three intersection points of the line $L$ and the curve $E$. We already know two of these roots: $x_1$ and $x_2$, the $x$-coordinates of $P$ and $Q$. Let the third root be $x_3$, which is the $x$-coordinate of the point $R$.\n\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a monic cubic polynomial $x^3+px^2+qx+r=0$ is equal to $-p$. In our case, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $-m^2$. Therefore:\n$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -(-m^2) = m^2$$\nFrom this, we can solve for $x_3$:\n$$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$$\nThe $y$-coordinate of $R$, denoted $y_R$, is found by using the line equation, since $R$ lies on $L$:\n$$y_R = m x_3 + c = m x_3 + (y_1-mx_1) = m(x_3 - x_1) + y_1$$\nThe sum $P+Q$ is defined as the reflection of $R=(x_3, y_R)$ across the $x$-axis. If $P+Q = (x_S, y_S)$, then:\n$$x_S = x_3$$\n$$y_S = -y_R$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $x_3$ and $y_R$, we obtain the explicit formulas for the sum of two distinct points:\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\n$$x_S = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$$\n$$y_S = -(m(x_S - x_1) + y_1) = m(x_1 - x_S) - y_1$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we apply these formulas to the specific problem. The curve is $E: y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$, and the points are $P=(x_1, y_1)=(0,1)$ and $Q=(x_2, y_2)=(2,1)$.\nFirst, we compute the slope $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{1-1}{2-0} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0$$\nNext, we compute the $x$-coordinate of the sum $P+Q$, which we denote as $(x_3, y_3)$:\n$$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 = 0^2 - 0 - 2 = -2$$\nFinally, we compute the $y$-coordinate of the sum:\n$$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 = 0(0 - (-2)) - 1 = 0(2) - 1 = -1$$\nThus, the sum of the points $P$ and $Q$ is $P+Q = (-2, -1)$.\n\nLastly, we verify that this resulting point lies on the curve $E$. We substitute the coordinates of $(-2, -1)$ into the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$:\nLeft-hand side: $y^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$.\nRight-hand side: $x^3 - 4x + 1 = (-2)^3 - 4(-2) + 1 = -8 + 8 + 1 = 1$.\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side ($1=1$), the point $(-2, -1)$ is indeed on the elliptic curve $E$.\n\nThis calculation demonstrates the closure property of the group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. The sum of two points with rational coordinates yields another point with rational coordinates that also lies on the curve. This closure is a fundamental axiom for a set to form a group. The Mordell-Weil theorem builds upon this group structure to make the much stronger claim that the group $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is finitely generated.\nThe resulting point is $(-2, -1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-2  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3092358"}, {"introduction": "The Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ decomposes into a finite torsion part and a free part of infinite-order points.

The set of rational points on the curve, denoted $E(\\mathbb{Q})$, forms an abelian group under a composition law where the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ serves as the identity element. The group law is defined geometrically: the sum of three distinct points $P, Q, R$ is $\\mathcal{O}$ if and only if they are collinear.\n\nThe Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is a finitely generated abelian group. By the structure theorem for such groups, it is isomorphic to a direct sum of a free part and a torsion part: $E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$, where $r$ is a non-negative integer called the rank of the curve, and $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ is the finite subgroup of torsion points (points of finite order).\n\nOur task is to determine the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ and find a lower bound for the rank $r$.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Torsion Subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$**\n\nWe will use the property that for a prime $p$ of good reduction, the reduction map $E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ induces an injective group homomorphism on the torsion subgroup, $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}} \\hookrightarrow E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. This implies that the order of the torsion subgroup, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}|$, must divide the order of the group of points over the finite field, $|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$.\n\nFirst, we determine the primes of good reduction. The curve is of the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ with $A = -1$ and $B = 0$. The discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$.\n$$ \\Delta = -16(4(-1)^3 + 27(0)^2) = -16(-4) = 64 = 2^6 $$\nA prime $p$ is a prime of good reduction if it does not divide the discriminant $\\Delta$. Thus, any odd prime is a prime of good reduction for $E$. We will select the small odd primes $p=3$ and $p=5$.\n\nNext, we identify some obvious rational points on $E$. Points with y-coordinate $y=0$ must satisfy $x^3 - x = 0$, which is $x(x-1)(x+1)=0$. This gives three rational points with integer coordinates: $P_1 = (0,0)$, $P_2 = (1,0)$, and $P_3 = (-1,0)$.\nIn the group law of an elliptic curve, a point $(x,0)$ satisfies $2P = \\mathcal{O}$ because the tangent line at such a point is vertical ($x=x_0$), intersecting the curve only at that point (with multiplicity 2) and the point at infinity. Thus, $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are points of order $2$.\nThe set of these points along with the identity element $\\mathcal{O}$ forms a subgroup $\\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (1,0), (-1,0)\\}$. This subgroup has order $4$ and contains three elements of order $2$. The only group of order $4$ with this property is the Klein four-group, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Since these points are in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$, the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ must contain this group. Therefore, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}|$ is at least $4$.\n\nNow we compute the size of $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for $p=3$ and $p=5$. The total number of points is $1$ (for $\\mathcal{O}$) plus the number of solutions $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p \\times \\mathbb{F}_p$ to $y^2 = x^3 - x$. For each $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, we count the number of solutions for $y$:\n- If $x^3-x = 0$, there is $1$ solution ($y=0$).\n- If $x^3-x$ is a non-zero quadratic residue modulo $p$, there are $2$ solutions.\n- If $x^3-x$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$, there are $0$ solutions.\n\nFor $p=3$, the equation is $y^2 = x^3 - x \\pmod 3$. The squares in $\\mathbb{F}_3$ are $0^2=0$ and $(\\pm 1)^2=1$.\n- If $x=0$, $y^2 = 0^3-0=0 \\implies y=0$. (1 point: $(0,0)$)\n- If $x=1$, $y^2 = 1^3-1=0 \\implies y=0$. (1 point: $(1,0)$)\n- If $x=2$, $y^2 = 2^3-2=8-2=6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3 \\implies y=0$. (1 point: $(2,0)$)\nThe total number of finite points is $3$. Including the point at infinity, we have $|E(\\mathbb{F}_3)| = 3+1 = 4$.\n\nFor $p=5$, the equation is $y^2 = x^3 - x \\pmod 5$. The non-zero squares in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ are $1^2=1$, $2^2=4$, $3^2=9\\equiv 4$, $4^2=16\\equiv 1$. So the quadratic residues are $\\{0,1,4\\}$.\n- If $x=0$, $y^2 = 0 \\implies y=0$. (1 point: $(0,0)$)\n- If $x=1$, $y^2 = 0 \\implies y=0$. (1 point: $(1,0)$)\n- If $x=2$, $y^2 = 2^3-2=6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$. $y^2=1 \\implies y=\\pm 1 = 1,4$. (2 points: $(2,1), (2,4)$)\n- If $x=3$, $y^2 = 3^3-3=24 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$. $y^2=4 \\implies y=\\pm 2 = 2,3$. (2 points: $(3,2), (3,3)$)\n- If $x=4$, $y^2 = 4^3-4=60 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5 \\implies y=0$. (1 point: $(4,0)$)\nThe total number of finite points is $1+1+2+2+1=7$. Including the point at infinity, we have $|E(\\mathbb{F}_5)| = 7+1 = 8$.\n\nThe injectivity of torsion implies that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}|$ must divide both $|E(\\mathbb{F}_3)|=4$ and $|E(\\mathbb{F}_5)|=8$. Therefore, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}|$ must divide their greatest common divisor. We define the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers $a$ and $b$, not both zero, as the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\gcd(a,b)$.\n$$ |E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}| \\text{ must divide } \\gcd(4, 8) = 4. $$\nWe have already shown that there are at least $4$ torsion points, i.e., $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}| \\ge 4$.\nCombining these two facts, we conclude that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}| = 4$.\nAs established earlier, the group of order $4$ that we found, $\\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (1,0), (-1,0)\\}$, contains three elements of order $2$. A cyclic group of order $4$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, would have only one element of order $2$. Thus, the torsion subgroup must be isomorphic to the Klein four-group.\n$$ E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} $$\n\n**Part 2: Lower Bound on the Rank of $E(\\mathbb{Q})$**\n\nThe rank $r$ of $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is the number of independent generators of infinite order in the group $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. To establish a lower bound $r \\ge k$, one must identify at least $k$ rational points that are of infinite order and are independent in the group $E(\\mathbb{Q}) / E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$.\n\nThe problem directs us to establish this lower bound \"by considering rational points that are immediately visible on E\". This phrasing refers to points whose coordinates are simple to find by inspection, typically small integer or simple rational numbers.\nWe systematically searched for integer points $(x,y)$ on $y^2 = x^3 - x$.\n- If $y=0$, $x^3-x=0 \\implies x \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$. This gives the points $(0,0), (1,0), (-1,0)$.\n- If $y=\\pm 1$, $x^3-x-1=0$. By the rational root theorem, any rational root must be $\\pm 1$, neither of which is a solution.\n- If $y=\\pm 2$, $x^3-x-4=0$. By the rational root theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of $4$, i.e., $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4$. None of these satisfy the equation.\nThis exhaustive search for small integer coordinates yields only the points $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(-1,0)$.\n\nAs determined in Part 1, these three points, together with $\\mathcal{O}$, form the entirety of the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$. Points of finite order cannot contribute to the rank of the curve.\nSince the only \"immediately visible\" rational points are all torsion points, they provide no evidence for the existence of any point of infinite order. Consequently, from this analysis alone, we cannot prove that the rank $r$ is positive. The only lower bound for the rank that can be rigorously justified based on the provided instructions and the visible points is the trivial one. The rank, as a non-negative integer, must satisfy $r \\ge 0$. The available data does not allow us to claim a stronger lower bound, such as $r \\ge 1$.\n\nTherefore, the lower bound on the rank, based on the specified method, is $0$.\n\nThe final answer consists of two parts: the isomorphism type of the torsion subgroup and the numerical lower bound for the rank.\n1.
