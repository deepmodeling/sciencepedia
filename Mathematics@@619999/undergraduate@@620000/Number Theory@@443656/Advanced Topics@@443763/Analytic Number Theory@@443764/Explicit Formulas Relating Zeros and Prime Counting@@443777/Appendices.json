Since $x>0$ and $n \\ge 1$, we have $y>0$. Also, since $x$ is not an integer, $x \\ne n$, so $y \\ne 1$. We evaluate $J(y)$ using the residue theorem by closing the contour of integration. The evaluation depends on the value of $y$.\n\nCase 1: $y > 1$ (which corresponds to $n < x$).\nWe close the integration path with a large rectangular contour in the left half-plane. Let the contour $C_L$ consist of the vertical line segment from $c-iT$ to $c+iT$, a horizontal segment from $c+iT$ to $-M+iT$, a vertical segment from $-M+iT$ to $-M-iT$, and a horizontal segment from $-M-iT$ to $c-iT$, for large positive $M$ and $T$. The integrand is $f(s) = y^s/s$. Inside this contour, $f(s)$ is analytic everywhere except for a simple pole at $s=0$.\n\nBy the residue theorem, the integral over the closed contour $C_L$ is:\n$$\n\\oint_{C_L} \\frac{y^s}{s}\\,ds = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}_{s=0}\\left(\\frac{y^s}{s}\\right)\n$$\nThe residue at the simple pole $s=0$ is $\\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\cdot \\frac{y^s}{s} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} y^s = y^0 = 1$.\nThus, $\\oint_{C_L} \\frac{y^s}{s}\\,ds = 2\\pi i$.\n\nNow we analyze the integrals over the three additional segments of the contour as $T \\to \\infty$ and $M \\to \\infty$.\nOn the top segment, $s = \\sigma+iT$ for $\\sigma \\in [-M, c]$.

The integrand $f(s)=y^s/s$ is analytic inside and on this contour (the pole at $s=0$ is outside). By Cauchy's integral theorem:\n$$\n\\oint_{C_R} \\frac{y^s}{s}\\,ds = 0\n$$\nThe integrals over the top and bottom segments vanish as $T \\to \\infty$ for the same reason as in Case 1.\nOn the right segment, $s = M+it$ for $t \\in [-T, T]$. The integral's magnitude is bounded by:\n$$\n\\left|\\int_{-T}^{T} \\frac{y^{M+it}}{M+it} i\\,dt\\right| \\le \\int_{-T}^{T} \\frac{|y^{M} y^{it}|}{|M+it|}\\,dt \\le \\frac{y^{M}}{M} \\int_{-T}^{T} dt = \\frac{2T y^{M}}{M}\n$$\nSince $0 < y < 1$, $\\lim_{M\\to\\infty} y^M = 0$. So this integral vanishes as $M\\to\\infty$.\nThis implies that the original integral along the line segment from $c-iT$ to $c+iT$ must be zero in the limit $T \\to \\infty$.\nSo, $J(y) = 0$ for $0 < y < 1$.\n\nSummarizing the results for the inner integral:\n$$\nJ(x/n) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} \\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^s \\frac{ds}{s} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } x/n > 1 \\iff n < x \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } x/n < 1 \\iff n > x\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe case $x/n=1$ is excluded because $x$ is not an integer.\n\nSubstituting this back into the sum for $I(x)$:\n$$\nI(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} J(x/n) = \\sum_{n<x} 1 + \\sum_{n>x} 0\n$$\nThe sum is over all positive integers $n$ that are strictly less than $x$.
