The methods are based on fundamental representations of the function: its defining series, an alternating series representation, and an integral representation.\n\nA detailed explanation of each method and its convergence properties is provided below.\n\n### Method A: Direct Partial Sums\n\nThis method uses the defining series for the Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-s}$, which is valid for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)1$. The approximation for $\\zeta(2)$ is the $N$-term partial sum:\n$$\nS_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{n^2}\n$$\nThe error of this approximation is the tail of the series, $R_N = \\zeta(2) - S_N = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2}$. Using the integral test, we can bound this error:\n$$\n\\int_{N+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx  R_N  \\int_{N}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx\n$$\nCalculating the integral $\\int_N^\\infty x^{-2} dx = [-x^{-1}]_N^\\infty = \\frac{1}{N}$, we see that the error decreases as $O(N^{-1})$. This is known as algebraic or linear convergence. It is relatively slow; for instance, to gain one additional decimal digit of precision, one must increase $N$ by a factor of $10$.\n\n### Method B: Euler Transformation of the Alternating Series\n\nThis method leverages a different series representation for $\\zeta(2)$ derived from the Dirichlet eta function, $\\eta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s}$. Using the identity $\\eta(s) = (1-2^{1-s})\\zeta(s)$, we find for $s=2$:\n$$\n\\zeta(2) = \\frac{\\eta(2)}{1-2^{1-2}} = 2\\eta(2) = 2 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^2}\n$$\nThis is an alternating series which converges more quickly than the direct sum for $\\zeta(2)$, but its convergence is still algebraic. To accelerate it, we use the Euler transformation. We rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n a_n$ with $a_n = \\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}$. The Euler transformation gives the exact identity:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^n a_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Delta^k a_0}{2^{k+1}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta^k a_n$ are forward differences. The $M$-term approximation for $\\eta(2)$ is $E_M = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{\\Delta^k a_0}{2^{k+1}}$, so the approximation for $\\zeta(2)$ is $2E_M$. The terms in this new series decrease much more rapidly due to the $2^{k+1}$ in the denominator. For a sequence $a_n$ that is sufficiently smooth (like $1/(n+1)^2$), the forward differences $\\Delta^k a_0$ do not grow fast enough to counteract the geometric decay from the denominator. The error of this method behaves like $O(2^{-M})$, which is geometric convergence. This is significantly faster than the $O(N^{-1})$ convergence of the direct sum.\n\n### Method C: Integral Representation and Quadrature\n\nThis method uses the integral representation of the zeta function:\n$$\n\\zeta(2) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{e^x-1} dx\n$$\nThe integral is split at a point $A$, here chosen as $A=10$.\n\n$1$. The integral over the finite interval $[0, A]$ is calculated using $P$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature. For a function that is analytic within a region of the complex plane containing the interval of integration, the error of Gauss-Legendre quadrature decreases exponentially with the number of points $P$. The integrand $f(x) = \\frac{x}{e^x-1}$ is analytic on the entire real line (with a removable singularity at $x=0$) and has its nearest poles in the complex plane at $x=\\pm 2\\pi i$. Since the interval of integration $[0, 10]$ is well within the radius of convergence of a Taylor series centered at points in the interval, the quadrature is expected to be highly efficient. The error is expected to decrease at an exponential rate with $P$.\n\n$2$. The tail integral from $A$ to $\\infty$ is handled by expanding the integrand into a series, leading to:\n$$\n\\int_{A}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{e^x-1} dx = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} e^{-kA}\\!\\left(\\frac{A}{k}+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis series converges very rapidly due to the term $e^{-kA}$. For $A=10$, the ratio between successive terms is approximately $e^{-A} = e^{-10} \\approx 4.5 \\times 10^{-5}$. The series is truncated when the next term falls below a tolerance $\\tau=10^{-16}$, ensuring that the error from this part of the calculation is negligible and controlled.\n\nOverall, the error in Method C is dominated by the quadrature error, which converges exponentially. This method is expected to be the most accurate of the three for a given computational effort (represented by the parameter $P$).\n\nIn summary, the three methods are expected to show vastly different convergence rates: algebraic for Method A ($O(N^{-1})$), geometric for Method B ($O(2^{-M})$), and exponential for Method C ($O(c^{-P})$ for some constant $c1$).
