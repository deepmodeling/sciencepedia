The character $\\tilde{\\chi}$ is called the inducing character, and it is necessarily primitive.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of the character $\\chi_{8}$\nThe character $\\chi_{8}$ is defined modulo $q=8$. For an integer $n$ with $\\gcd(n,8)=1$ (i.e., $n$ is odd), its value is given by:\n$$\n\\chi_{8}(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\n-1  \\text{if } n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor integers $n$ with $\\gcd(n,8)\\neq 1$, $\\chi_{8}(n)=0$.\n\nThe divisors of $q=8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8$. We must find the smallest divisor $f$ from this set that can serve as the modulus for an inducing character.\n\n1.  Test $f=1$: A character $\\tilde{\\chi}$ modulo $1$ must satisfy $\\tilde{\\chi}(n)=1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (as $\\gcd(n,1)=1$ for all $n$). We are required to have $\\chi_8(n) = \\tilde{\\chi}(n)$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n,8)=1$. Let's test $n=3$. We have $\\gcd(3,8)=1$, and $\\chi_{8}(3)=-1$ by definition. However, $\\tilde{\\chi}(3)=1$. Since $-1 \\neq 1$, no character modulo $1$ can induce $\\chi_8$. Thus, the conductor is not $1$.\n\n2.  Test $f=2$: The group of invertible residues modulo $2$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^* = \\{1\\}$. The only character $\\tilde{\\chi}$ modulo $2$ is the principal character, which maps all odd numbers to $1$. So, for any odd $n$, $\\tilde{\\chi}(n)=1$. Again, for $n=3$, $\\gcd(3,8)=1$, and we have the contradiction $\\chi_{8}(3)=-1 \\neq \\tilde{\\chi}(3)=1$. Thus, the conductor is not $2$.\n\n3.  Test $f=4$: We seek a character $\\tilde{\\chi}$ modulo $4$ such that $\\chi_8(n) = \\tilde{\\chi}(n)$ for all odd $n$. The definition of $\\chi_8(n)$ for odd $n$ depends only on the value of $n \\pmod{4}$. This suggests such a character exists. Let's define $\\tilde{\\chi}_4$ modulo $4$ as follows:\n    -   $\\tilde{\\chi}_4(n) = 1$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n    -   $\\tilde{\\chi}_4(n) = -1$ if $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n    -   $\\tilde{\\chi}_4(n) = 0$ if $\\gcd(n,4)\\neq 1$.\n    This is the well-known non-principal character modulo $4$. Let's verify if it induces $\\chi_8$. For any $n$ with $\\gcd(n,8)=1$, $n$ must be odd. If $n$ is odd, then $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ or $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n    -   If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\chi_8(n)=1$ and $\\tilde{\\chi}_4(n)=1$.\n    -   If $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\chi_8(n)=-1$ and $\\tilde{\\chi}_4(n)=-1$.\n    In all cases where $\\gcd(n,8)=1$, we have $\\chi_8(n) = \\tilde{\\chi}_4(n)$.\n    Since we have found a valid inducing character for $f=4$, and we have already shown that $f=1$ and $f=2$ are not possible, the smallest such divisor of $8$ is $f=4$.\n    Therefore, the conductor of $\\chi_8$ is $4$. The inducing primitive character is this non-principal character $\\tilde{\\chi}_4$ modulo $4$. It is primitive because its modulus $4$ has only proper divisors $1$ and $2$, and we've shown that no character modulo $1$ or $2$ can generate it (since it takes the value $-1$).\n\nPart 2: Analysis of the character $\\chi_{12}$\nThe character $\\chi_{12}$ is defined modulo $q=12$. For an integer $n$ with $\\gcd(n,12)=1$ (i.e., $n$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$), its value is given by:\n$$\n\\chi_{12}(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n-1  \\text{if } n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor integers $n$ with $\\gcd(n,12)\\neq 1$, $\\chi_{12}(n)=0$.\n\nThe divisors of $q=12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$. We search for the smallest divisor $f$ that is a conductor.\n\nThe definition of $\\chi_{12}(n)$ for $n$ coprime to $12$ depends only on $n \\pmod{3}$. This strongly suggests that the conductor might be $3$. Let's check divisors in increasing order.\n\n1.  Test $f=1$: As before, this implies the trivial character $\\tilde{\\chi}(n)=1$. For $n=5$, we have $\\gcd(5,12)=1$. By definition, $\\chi_{12}(5)=-1$ because $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. Since $-1 \\neq 1$, the conductor is not $1$.\n\n2.  Test $f=2$: This implies the principal character modulo $2$, with $\\tilde{\\chi}(n)=1$ for odd $n$. For $n=5$, $\\chi_{12}(5)=-1 \\neq \\tilde{\\chi}(5)=1$. So the conductor is not $2$.\n\n3.  Test $f=3$: Let's define a character $\\tilde{\\chi}_3$ modulo $3$:\n    -   $\\tilde{\\chi}_3(n) = 1$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n    -   $\\tilde{\\chi}_3(n) = -1$ if $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    -   $\\tilde{\\chi}_3(n) = 0$ if $\\gcd(n,3)\\neq 1$.\n    This is the non-principal character modulo $3$, also known as the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)$. Let's check if it induces $\\chi_{12}$. We need $\\chi_{12}(n)=\\tilde{\\chi}_3(n)$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n,12)=1$.\n    If $\\gcd(n,12)=1$, then $n$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, which implies $\\gcd(n,3)=1$. So $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ or $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    -   If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $\\chi_{12}(n)=1$ and $\\tilde{\\chi}_3(n)=1$.\n    -   If $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $\\chi_{12}(n)=-1$ and $\\tilde{\\chi}_3(n)=-1$.\n    The condition holds for all $n$ coprime to $12$. We have shown there exists an inducing character for $f=3$.\n    For minimality, we must confirm that no proper divisor of $3$ can be a conductor. The only proper divisor of $3$ is $1$. We have already ruled out $f=1$.\n    Therefore, the conductor of $\\chi_{12}$ is $3$. The inducing character $\\tilde{\\chi}_3$ is primitive because any non-principal character modulo a prime number is primitive.\n\nPart 3: Final Calculation\nThe conductor of $\\chi_8$ is $f_1 = 4$.\nThe conductor of $\\chi_{12}$ is $f_2 = 3$.\nThe problem asks for the product of these two conductors.\nProduct = $f_1 \\times f_2 = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "3090419"}, {"introduction": "The Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem provides a powerful statement about the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, summarized by the function $\\psi(x;q,a)$.

The associated heuristic is that for a fixed modulus $q$ and $(a,q)=1$, $\\psi(x;q,a)$ is well-approximated by its expected value, $x/\\varphi(q)$. For our case, $x=1000$ and $q=4$, so $\\varphi(4)=2$.

The Prime Number Theorem implies $\\psi(x) \\sim x$, so $\\psi(x,\\chi_0) \\sim x$. This is the dominant term.\nThe term $\\psi(x,\\chi_4) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\Lambda(n)\\chi_4(n)$ involves the non-principal character $\\chi_4$. It is a cornerstone result of analytic number theory that for any non-principal character $\\chi$, $\\psi(x,\\chi) = o(x)$. This means $\\psi(x,\\chi_4)$ grows slower than $x$.\n\nSubstituting these asymptotics into the expressions for $\\psi(x;4,a)$:\n$$\n\\psi(x;4,1) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(x + o(x)) \\approx \\frac{x}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi(x;4,3) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(x - o(x)) \\approx \\frac{x}{2}\n$$\nBoth quantities are asymptotically equal to $x/2 = x/\\varphi(4)$, which is the heuristic suggested by the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem.

Let's analyze the first two terms. We need to derive a bound of the form $\\ll x/(\\ln x)^\\alpha$ valid for $Q \\leq x^{1/2}/(\\ln x)^{B'(A)}$. To use the hypothesis, our choice of $B'$ must satisfy $B' \\geq B(A)$.\n\n1.  **The term $\\frac{S_\\theta(x,Q)}{\\ln x}$**:\n    Using our bound for $S_\\theta(x,Q)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{S_\\theta(x,Q)}{\\ln x} \\ll \\frac{1}{\\ln x} \\left(\\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^A} + Q x^{1/2}\\right) = \\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^{A+1}} + \\frac{Q x^{1/2}}{\\ln x}\n    $$\n2.  **The integral term $\\int_2^x \\frac{S_\\theta(t,Q)}{t(\\ln t)^2} dt$**:\n    We split the integral and substitute the bound for $S_\\theta(t,Q)$.\n    $$\n    \\int_2^x \\frac{S_\\theta(t,Q)}{t(\\ln t)^2} dt \\ll \\int_2^x \\frac{t/(\\ln t)^A + Q t^{1/2}}{t(\\ln t)^2} dt = \\int_2^x \\frac{dt}{(\\ln t)^{A+2}} + Q \\int_2^x \\frac{dt}{t^{1/2}(\\ln t)^2}\n    $$\n    The first integral is $O(x/(\\ln x)^{A+2})$. The second is $O(x^{1/2}/(\\ln x)^2)$. So, this part contributes $O(x/(\\ln x)^{A+2} + Q x^{1/2}/(\\ln x)^2)$.\n\nCombining all terms, the total error is dominated by:\n$$\n\\sum_{q \\le Q} \\max_a |\\dots| \\ll \\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^{A+1}} + \\frac{Q x^{1/2}}{\\ln x}\n$$\nNow we use the condition on $Q$. We are deriving a new theorem for $\\pi$, valid for a range $Q \\leq x^{1/2}/(\\ln x)^{B'}$. As noted, we must choose $B' \\geq B(A)$ for the derivation to be valid. Let's make such a choice. The second term becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{Q x^{1/2}}{\\ln x} \\leq \\frac{x^{1/2}}{(\\ln x)^{B'}} \\frac{x^{1/2}}{\\ln x} = \\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^{B'+1}}\n$$\nSo the total error is bounded by:\n$$\n\\ll \\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^{A+1}} + \\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^{B'+1}} \\ll \\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^{\\min(A+1, B'+1)}}\n$$\nThe resulting exponent is $\\alpha = \\min(A+1, B'+1)$. The problem asks for $\\alpha$ in terms of $A$ only. We are free to choose the parameter $B'$ for our new theorem, under the constraint $B' \\geq B(A)$. Let's choose $B'(A) = \\max(A, B(A))$. This choice satisfies $B' \\geq B(A)$. With this choice, the exponent becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\min(A+1, \\max(A, B(A))+1)\n$$\nWe consider two cases:\n-   Case 1: $B(A) \\leq A$. Then $\\max(A, B(A)) = A$, and $\\alpha = \\min(A+1, A+1) = A+1$.\n-   Case 2: $B(A) > A$. Then $\\max(A, B(A)) = B(A)$, and $\\alpha = \\min(A+1, B(A)+1) = A+1$.\n\nIn both cases, we find that the resulting exponent is $\\alpha = A+1$. This result holds for $Q \\leq x^{1/2}/(\\ln x)^{B'(A)}$ where $B'(A) = \\max(A, B(A))$.\n\nThus, the exponent is determined solely by $A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A+1}$$", "id": "3090431"}]}
