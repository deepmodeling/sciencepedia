We are given that $G$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. Let $g$ be a fixed primitive root modulo $p$, which means $g$ is a generator of $G$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $p$, when restricted to $G$, is a group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to \\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$. The group $G$ consists of the residue classes $\\{g^{0}, g^{1}, \\dots, g^{p-2}\\}$. As a homomorphism, $\\chi$ is completely determined by its value on the generator $g$. Let's denote this value by $c = \\chi(g) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$.\n\nThe order of the group $G$ is $p-1$, so $g^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Applying the homomorphism $\\chi$ to this relation gives:\n$$\n\\chi(g^{p-1}) = \\chi(1)\n$$\nSince $\\chi$ is a homomorphism, $\\chi(1)$ is the identity in $\\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$, which is $1$. Also, $\\chi(g^{p-1}) = (\\chi(g))^{p-1} = c^{p-1}$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\nc^{p-1} = 1\n$$\nThis equation implies that $c$ must be a $(p-1)$-th root of unity. The distinct $(p-1)$-th roots of unity are given by $\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i r}{p-1}\\right)$ for $r \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}$.\n\nLet us define $\\omega = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{p-1}\\right)$, which is a primitive $(p-1)$-th root of unity. Then the possible values for $c = \\chi(g)$ are $\\omega^r$ for $r \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}$. Each choice of $r$ defines a distinct character. Let's parametrize the characters by this index $r$.\n\nFor each $r \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}$, we define the character $\\chi_r$ by its value on the generator $g$:\n$$\n\\chi_r(g) = \\omega^r = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i r}{p-1}\\right)\n$$\nFor any element $a \\in G$, there is a unique integer $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}$ such that $a \\equiv g^k \\pmod{p}$. The value of $\\chi_r$ on $a$ is then determined by the homomorphism property:\n$$\n\\chi_r(a) = \\chi_r(g^k) = (\\chi_r(g))^k = (\\omega^r)^k = \\omega^{rk}\n$$\nSo, the explicit formula for the characters is:\n$$\n\\chi_r(g^k) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i r k}{p-1}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } r, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}\n$$\nThese $p-1$ functions represent all the Dirichlet characters modulo $p$. For any integer $n$, the full character is defined as $\\chi_r(n) = \\chi_r(g^k)$ if $n \\equiv g^k \\pmod{p}$, and $\\chi_r(n) = 0$ if $\\gcd(n, p) \\neq 1$. The character with $r=0$ is the principal character $\\chi_0$, where $\\chi_0(g^k) = \\omega^{0} = 1$ for all $k$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $|\\det(M)|$**\n\nThe problem defines a $(p-1) \\times (p-1)$ matrix $M$ with entries $M_{r,k} = \\chi_r(g^k)$, where the row index $r$ and the column index $k$ both range from $0$ to $p-2$. Using the result from Part 1, the entries of $M$ are:\n$$\nM_{r,k} = \\omega^{rk} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i r k}{p-1}\\right)\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the absolute value of the determinant of $M$, $|\\det(M)|$, using orthogonality relations derived from the geometric series identity.\n\nLet's consider the matrix product $C = M M^\\dagger$, where $M^\\dagger$ is the conjugate transpose of $M$. The entries of $M^\\dagger$ are given by $(M^\\dagger)_{ij} = \\overline{M_{ji}}$. In our case, $(M^\\dagger)_{ks} = \\overline{M_{sk}} = \\overline{\\omega^{sk}} = \\omega^{-sk}$, since $|\\omega|=1$.\n\nThe $(r,s)$-entry of the product matrix $C$ is:\n$$\nC_{rs} = \\sum_{k=0}^{p-2} M_{rk} (M^\\dagger)_{ks} = \\sum_{k=0}^{p-2} M_{rk} \\overline{M_{sk}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{p-2} \\omega^{rk} \\omega^{-sk} = \\sum_{k=0}^{p-2} (\\omega^{r-s})^k\n$$\nThis is a geometric series in the variable $z = \\omega^{r-s}$ with $p-1$ terms. We analyze it in two cases, as per the geometric series identity $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} z^j = n$ if $z=1$ and $\\frac{z^n-1}{z-1}$ if $z \\neq 1$.\n\nCase 1: $r = s$.\nIn this case, $r-s = 0$, so the base of the series is $z = \\omega^0 = 1$. The sum is:\n$$\nC_{rr} = \\sum_{k=0}^{p-2} 1^k = p-1\n$$\n\nCase 2: $r \\neq s$.\nSince $r, s \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}$, the difference $r-s$ is a non-zero integer in the range $-(p-2) \\le r-s \\le p-2$. Thus, $r-s$ is not a multiple of $p-1$. This implies that the base of the series $z = \\omega^{r-s} \\neq 1$. The sum is:\n$$\nC_{rs} = \\frac{(\\omega^{r-s})^{p-1} - 1}{\\omega^{r-s} - 1} = \\frac{(\\omega^{p-1})^{r-s} - 1}{\\omega^{r-s} - 1}\n$$\nBy definition, $\\omega^{p-1} = 1$. So the numerator becomes $1^{r-s} - 1 = 0$.\n$$\nC_{rs} = 0\n$$\nCombining both cases, we have shown the orthogonality relation for the characters:\n$$\nC_{rs} = (p-1)\\delta_{rs}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{rs}$ is the Kronecker delta. This means that the matrix $C = M M^\\dagger$ is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal entries equal to $p-1$. We can write this as:\n$$\nM M^\\dagger = (p-1) I_{p-1}\n$$\nwhere $I_{p-1}$ is the $(p-1) \\times (p-1)$ identity matrix.\n\nNow, we take the determinant of both sides of this matrix equation. Using the properties $\\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B)$ and $\\det(c A) = c^n \\det(A)$ for an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, we get:\n$$\n\\det(M M^\\dagger) = \\det((p-1) I_{p-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\det(M) \\det(M^\\dagger) = (p-1)^{p-1}\n$$\nThe determinant of a conjugate transpose matrix is the complex conjugate of the original determinant: $\\det(M^\\dagger) = \\overline{\\det(M)}$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\det(M) \\overline{\\det(M)} = (p-1)^{p-1}\n$$\nThe product of a complex number $z$ with its conjugate $\\bar{z}$ is the square of its absolute value, $|z|^2$. Thus:\n$$\n|\\det(M)|^2 = (p-1)^{p-1}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the absolute value of the determinant. Since the absolute value must be non-negative:\n$$\n|\\det(M)| = \\sqrt{(p-1)^{p-1}} = (p-1)^{(p-1)/2}\n$$\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $p-1$ is an even integer, so the exponent $(p-1)/2$ is an integer.

Since $R_K > 0$, this is equivalent to $R_K \\leq 5 \\times 10^{-7}$. Using our derived bound:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{9K} \\leq 5 \\times 10^{-7}\n$$\nSolving for $K$:\n$$\nK \\geq \\frac{1}{9 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{1}{45 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{10^7}{45} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^6}{9}\n$$\n$$\nK \\geq 222222.222\\dots\n$$\nSince $K$ must be an integer, the smallest value of $K$ that satisfies this condition is $K=222223$.\n\nFor part 4, we are asked to find the exact value of $L(1,\\chi)$ and confirm it is non-zero. We start from the grouped series again:\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{3k+1} - \\frac{1}{3k+2} \\right)\n$$\nTo use the properties of the digamma function $\\psi(z)$, we factor out a $3$ from the denominators:\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k+1/3} - \\frac{1}{k+2/3} \\right)\n$$\nThe digamma function $\\psi(z)$ has a series representation that leads to the following identity for $z_1, z_2$ not being non-positive integers:\n$$\n\\psi(z_1) - \\psi(z_2) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k+z_2} - \\frac{1}{k+z_1} \\right)\n$$\nBy setting $z_2 = 1/3$ and $z_1 = 2/3$, we can identify our sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k+1/3} - \\frac{1}{k+2/3} \\right) = \\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3)\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3) \\right)\n$$\nNow, we use the reflection formula for the digamma function: $\\psi(1-z) - \\psi(z) = \\pi\\cot(\\pi z)$. Setting $z=1/3$:\n$$\n\\psi(1-1/3) - \\psi(1/3) = \\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3) = \\pi\\cot(\\pi/3)\n$$\nThe cotangent is $\\cot(\\pi/3) = \\frac{1}{\\tan(\\pi/3)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nSo, $\\psi(2/3) - \\psi(1/3) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $L(1,\\chi)$:\n$$\nL(1,\\chi) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThis is the exact value of the series. Since $\\pi > 0$ and $\\sqrt{3} > 0$, it is evident that $L(1,\\chi) > 0$ and thus $L(1,\\chi) \\neq 0$.\n\nAs a final check, we can compute the decimal value. $L(1,\\chi) = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.604599788...$. Rounded to six significant figures, this is $0.604600$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}}}$$", "id": "3084139"}]}
