It is a well-posed question in analytic number theory based on established mathematical facts. It is self-contained, objective, and scientifically sound. We may thus proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to use the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$, to deduce the locations of its so-called \"trivial zeros\" and determine their multiplicity. The problem states that the functional equation relates $\\zeta(s)$ to $\\zeta(1-s)$ via factors including the sine function and the Gamma function. The relevant form of the functional equation is the asymmetric one:\n$$ \\zeta(s) = 2^s \\pi^{s-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(1-s) \\zeta(1-s) $$\nThis equation provides the meromorphic continuation of $\\zeta(s)$ to the entire complex plane. We are asked to analyze the behavior of $\\zeta(s)$ at the points $s = -2n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\nLet us set $s = -2n$ for some positive integer $n$. We will examine each term on the right-hand side of the functional equation.\n\n1.  **The factor $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)$**:\n    At $s = -2n$, the argument of the sine function is $\\frac{\\pi (-2n)}{2} = -n\\pi$. For any integer $n$, $\\sin(-n\\pi) = 0$. This implies that the entire right-hand side is zero, provided the other factors do not introduce a pole that could cancel this zero. Thus, we can deduce that $\\zeta(-2n) = 0$. These are the trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.\n\n2.  **Multiplicity of the zeros**:\n    To determine the multiplicity of the zero at $s = -2n$, we must analyze the order of the zero for each factor in the product at this point. The order of a zero of a product of analytic functions is the sum of the orders of the zeros of the individual functions (where a pole is considered a zero of negative order).\n\n    Let's analyze each factor in the neighborhood of $s = -2n$:\n    *   The factors $2^s$ and $\\pi^{s-1}$ are entire functions and are non-zero for any finite $s$. At $s = -2n$, their values are $2^{-2n}$ and $\\pi^{-2n-1}$, which are finite and non-zero. Their contribution to the order of the zero is $0$.\n\n    *   The factor $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)$. The problem statement gives that this function has simple zeros at $s=-2n$. A simple zero has a multiplicity (or order) of $1$. To verify this, we can compute the derivative of $f(s) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi s}{2})$ at $s=-2n$:\n      $$ f'(s) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) $$\n      $$ f'(-2n) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(-2n)}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos(-n\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} (-1)^n $$\n      Since the first derivative is non-zero while the function itself is zero, the zero at $s=-2n$ is simple. The order of the zero is $1$.\n\n    *   The factor $\\Gamma(1-s)$. At $s=-2n$ (where $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$), the argument is $1-s = 1-(-2n) = 1+2n$. Since $n \\ge 1$, $1+2n$ is an integer greater than or equal to $3$. The problem states that the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z)$ is holomorphic and nonzero at all positive integers $z$. Therefore, $\\Gamma(1+2n)$ is a finite, non-zero value. This factor is holomorphic and non-zero at $s=-2n$, so its contribution to the order of the zero is $0$.\n\n    *   The factor $\\zeta(1-s)$. At $s=-2n$, the argument is $1-s = 1+2n$. Since $n \\ge 1$, we have $1+2n \\ge 3$. The argument is in the region of absolute convergence for the defining series of the zeta function, which is $\\operatorname{Re}(z) > 1$. The problem states that the Euler product shows $\\zeta(z) \\neq 0$ for $\\operatorname{Re}(z)>1$. Thus, $\\zeta(1+2n)$ is a finite, non-zero value. For example, $\\zeta(3) > 1$. This factor is holomorphic and non-zero at $s=-2n$, so its contribution to the order of the zero is $0$.\n\nIn summary, for $s=-2n$ where $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n*   $2^s \\pi^{s-1}$: non-zero and holomorphic (order $0$).\n*   $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)$: has a simple zero (order $1$).\n*   $\\Gamma(1-s)$: non-zero and holomorphic (order $0$).\n*   $\\zeta(1-s)$: non-zero and holomorphic (order $0$).\n\nThe order of the zero of $\\zeta(s)$ at $s=-2n$ is the sum of the orders of the zeros of its factors.\n$$ \\text{Order} = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\nA zero of order $1$ is called a simple zero.
