It presents a standard exercise in elementary probabilistic number theory. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the sample space be $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, \\dots, x\\}$, where an integer $n$ is chosen with uniform probability. The size of the sample space is $|\\Omega| = x$. The probability of choosing any specific integer $n \\in \\Omega$ is $P(n) = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nThe random variable is defined as $X_{p} = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{p \\mid n\\}}$, which is an indicator random variable for the event that $n$ is divisible by the prime $p$. This means $X_p$ takes the value $1$ if $p$ divides $n$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFirst, we derive the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_p]$. For an indicator random variable, the expectation is equal to the probability of the event it indicates.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{p}] = P(X_{p}=1) = P(\\{n \\in \\Omega : p \\mid n\\})\n$$\nThe event $\\{n \\in \\Omega : p \\mid n\\}$ consists of all multiples of $p$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, x\\}$. The number of such integers is given by the problem statement as $\\lfloor x/p \\rfloor$.\nThe probability of this event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{p}] = \\frac{|\\{n \\in \\Omega : p \\mid n\\}|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{\\lfloor x/p \\rfloor}{x}\n$$\nThis is the explicit formula for the expectation of $X_p$.\n\nNext, we derive the variance $\\operatorname{Var}(X_p)$. The variance of a random variable $Y$ is defined as $\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[Y^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2$.\nFor the indicator variable $X_p$, its values are restricted to $0$ and $1$. Therefore, $X_p^2$ is identical to $X_p$, since $0^2=0$ and $1^2=1$. This property implies that $\\mathbb{E}[X_p^2] = \\mathbb{E}[X_p]$.\nSubstituting this into the variance formula, we get:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X_p) = \\mathbb{E}[X_p] - (\\mathbb{E}[X_p])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_p](1 - \\mathbb{E}[X_p])\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[X_p]$ we derived earlier:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X_p) = \\frac{\\lfloor x/p \\rfloor}{x} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lfloor x/p \\rfloor}{x}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the explicit formula for the variance of $X_p$.\n\nFinally, we derive an explicit bound on the absolute discrepancy $|\\mathbb{E}[X_p] - 1/p|$.

Using the definition of $Y_f(x)$ as the sum $Y_{f}(x)=\\sum_{p\\leqslant x} f(p)\\,X_{p}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_{f}(x) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{p\\leqslant x} f(p)\\,X_{p}\\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expectation of the sum is the sum of expectations:\n$$\n\\mu_{f}(x) = \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} \\mathbb{E}[f(p)\\,X_{p}]\n$$\nFor each prime $p$, the value $f(p)$ is a deterministic constant, so it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\n\\mu_{f}(x) = \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} f(p)\\,\\mathbb{E}[X_{p}]\n$$\nThe random variable $X_{p}$ is a Bernoulli variable with parameter $1/p$. The expectation of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $\\theta$ is $\\theta$. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[X_{p}] = 1/p$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mu_{f}(x)$ yields:\n$$\n\\mu_{f}(x) = \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} \\frac{f(p)}{p}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the model mean.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the model variance $\\sigma_{f}^{2}(x)$. By definition, $\\sigma_{f}^{2}(x) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y_{f}(x))$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{f}^{2}(x) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{p\\leqslant x} f(p)\\,X_{p}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the random variables $X_{p}$ are independent for different primes $p$. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{f}^{2}(x) = \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} \\mathrm{Var}(f(p)\\,X_{p})\n$$\nUsing the property $\\mathrm{Var}(cZ) = c^2\\mathrm{Var}(Z)$ for a constant $c$, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_{f}^{2}(x) = \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} f(p)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(X_{p})\n$$\nThe variance of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $\\theta$ is $\\theta(1-\\theta)$. For $X_p$, the parameter is $\\theta = 1/p$. So, $\\mathrm{Var}(X_{p}) = \\frac{1}{p}(1 - \\frac{1}{p})$.

The mean value of $f(n)$ for $n \\le x$ is associated with the sum $A_f(x) = \\sum_{p^k \\le x} \\frac{f(p^k)}{p^k(1-1/p)}$. For simplicity, we consider the closely related sum $A_f^*(x) = \\sum_{p^k \\le x} \\frac{f(p^k)}{p^k}$. Since $f$ is strongly additive, $f(p^k)=f(p)$. We can split this sum into contributions from $k=1$ and $k \\ge 2$:\n$$\nA_f^*(x) = \\sum_{p \\le x} \\frac{f(p)}{p} + \\sum_{\\substack{p^k \\le x \\\\ k \\ge 2}} \\frac{f(p)}{p^k}\n$$\nThe first term is exactly the model mean $\\mu_f(x)$. We analyze the second term. Assuming $f$ is bounded on primes, i.e., $|f(p)| \\le M$ for some constant $M$, we can bound the sum over higher powers:\n$$\n\\left| \\sum_{\\substack{p^k \\le x \\\\ k \\ge 2}} \\frac{f(p)}{p^k} \\right| \\le \\sum_{p} |f(p)| \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{p^k} \\le M \\sum_{p} \\frac{1/p^2}{1-1/p} = M \\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p(p-1)}\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p(p-1)}$ is a subseries of $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n(n-1)}$, which converges to $1$. Therefore, the contribution from higher prime powers ($k \\ge 2$) is bounded by a constant. In many typical cases (as in part (b)), the main term $\\mu_f(x) = \\sum_{p \\le x} f(p)/p$ diverges as $x \\to \\infty$. Thus, the constant contribution from higher powers is asymptotically negligible.\n\nA similar argument applies to the variance. The true variance of $f(n)$ is related to a sum over prime powers, $B_f^2(x) = \\sum_{p^k \\le x} \\frac{f(p^k)^2}{p^k}$. For strongly additive $f$ with $|f(p)| \\le M$:\n$$\nB_f^2(x) = \\sum_{p \\le x} \\frac{f(p)^2}{p} + \\sum_{\\substack{p^k \\le x \\\\ k \\ge 2}} \\frac{f(p)^2}{p^k}\n$$\nThe contribution from $k \\ge 2$ is bounded by $M^2 \\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p(p-1)}$, which is a constant. This is negligible compared to the principal term $\\sum_{p \\le x} f(p)^2/p$ if this sum diverges (which it does in many important cases). Also, within our model variance $\\sigma_f^2(x)$, the term $\\sum_{p \\le x} \\frac{f(p)^2}{p^2}$ is bounded by $M^2 \\sum_p \\frac{1}{p^2}$ (which converges), so it is an $O(1)$ term, negligible compared to $\\sum_{p \\le x} \\frac{f(p)^2}{p}$ if the latter diverges.\n\n(b) Asymptotic expressions for $f(p^k)=1$.\n\nFor this specific case, $f$ is strongly additive with $f(p)=1$. The function is $\\omega(n)$, the number of distinct prime factors of $n$. The general expressions from part (a) become:\n$$\n\\mu_{f}(x) = \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} \\frac{1}{p}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{f}^{2}(x) = \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} \\frac{1}{p} - \\sum_{p\\leqslant x} \\frac{1}{p^{2}}\n$$\nWe need to find the leading-order asymptotic behavior of these sums as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor $\\mu_f(x)$, we use partial summation (also known as Abel's summation formula). Let $A(t) = \\pi(t) = \\sum_{p \\le t} 1$ be the prime-counting function. Then $\\mu_f(x)$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\sum_{p \\leqslant x} \\frac{1}{p} = \\sum_{n=2}^{x} \\frac{\\mathbb{I}(n \\text{ is prime})}{n}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.

So this integral contributes a constant term.\nCombining all terms, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\ln x} + O\\left(\\frac{1}{(\\ln x)^{2}}\\right) + \\ln(\\ln x) - \\ln(\\ln 2) + O(1)\n$$\nThe dominant term as $x \\to \\infty$ is $\\ln(\\ln x)$.

The second sum, $\\sum_{p\\leqslant x} \\frac{1}{p^{2}}$, is a partial sum of the convergent series $\\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p^{2}}$. This series converges to a constant known as the prime zeta function value $P(2) \\approx 0.4522$. Thus, as $x \\to \\infty$, $\\sum_{p \\le x} \\frac{1}{p^2} \\to P(2)$.

A naive approach, which involves factoring each integer $n$ separately, would be too slow, with a time complexity of roughly $\\mathcal{O}(N\\sqrt{N})$. The problem statement correctly suggests that a more efficient, sieve-like methodology is appropriate. We will adapt the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is used for finding prime numbers, to instead count prime factors.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize an integer array, denoted as $\\texttt{omega}$, of size $N+1$ with all elements set to $0$. The element $\\texttt{omega}[n]$ will store the value of $\\omega(n)$. By convention, $\\omega(1)=0$, which is satisfied by the initialization.\n2.  Iterate through integers $p$ from $2$ to $N$.\n3.  For each $p$, check the value of $\\texttt{omega}[p]$. If $\\texttt{omega}[p]$ is $0$, it means that $p$ has not been divided by any smaller prime factor. In an ordered traversal from $2$ to $N$, this condition uniquely identifies $p$ as a prime number.\n4.  Upon finding a prime $p$, we iterate through all its multiples $m$ (i.e., $m = p, 2p, 3p, \\dots$) up to $N$. For each such multiple $m$, we increment $\\texttt{omega}[m]$. This step signifies that we have found a new distinct prime factor, $p$, for each of its multiples.\n\nAfter the outer loop completes, the $\\texttt{omega}$ array will contain the value of $\\omega(n)$ for each $n \\in [1, N]$.\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n\nThe time complexity of this sieve is determined by the total number of increment operations performed. The condition $\\texttt{omega}[p] == 0$ ensures that the inner loop (updating multiples) is executed only for prime values of $p$. For each prime $p \\le N$, the inner loop executes $\\lfloor N/p \\rfloor$ times. The total number of operations is therefore the sum over all primes $p \\le N$:\n$$ \\text{Total Operations} = \\sum_{p \\le N, p \\text{ is prime}} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N}{p} \\right\\rfloor $$\nThis sum can be approximated as:\n$$ N \\sum_{p \\le N} \\frac{1}{p} $$\nAccording to one of Mertens' theorems from analytic number theory, the sum of the reciprocals of primes is given by:\n$$ \\sum_{p \\le x} \\frac{1}{p} = \\log\\log x + M + o(1) $$\nwhere $M \\approx 0.261497$ is the Meissel–Mertens constant. Consequently, the time complexity of our algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log\\log N)$, which satisfies the problem's requirement. The memory complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ due to the storage needed for the $\\texttt{omega}$ array.\n\n### Execution of Test Suite\n\nThe program will implement the sieve and then calculate the five required outputs. For efficiency, the sieve will be run a single time for the maximum value of $N$ specified in the test suite ($N=100000$), and the results for smaller $N$ will be extracted from this comprehensive computation.\n\n1.  **For $N = 1$**: The output is $[\\omega(1)]$. As $\\omega(1)=0$, the result is $[0]$.\n2.  **For $N = 10$**: The output is the list $[\\omega(1), \\dots, \\omega(10)]$. The sieve will compute values such as $\\omega(6) = \\omega(2 \\cdot 3) = 2$ and $\\omega(10) = \\omega(2 \\cdot 5) = 2$.\n3.  **For $N = 100$**: The output is the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^{100} \\omega(n)$, computed by summing the relevant entries in the $\\texttt{omega}$ array.\n4.  **For $N = 1000$**: The output is $\\max_{1 \\le n \\le 1000} \\omega(n)$. The maximum is achieved for numbers that are products of the smallest distinct primes. The product $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 210$ has $\\omega(210)=4$. The next such product, $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 = 2310$, exceeds $1000$. Therefore, the maximum value of $\\omega(n)$ for $n \\le 1000$ is $4$.\n5.  **For $N = 100000$**: The program computes the difference between the empirical mean, $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\omega(n)$, and the theoretical approximation $\\log\\log N$. This value is expected to be close to the Meissel–Mertens constant $M$, which serves as a validation of the Erdős–Kac theorem's underlying principle and the correctness of the implementation. The result is rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nThe final output is a single string concatenating the five results in the specified format, paying close attention to the representation of lists and the precision of the final floating-point number.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_omega_sieve(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes omega(n), the number of distinct prime factors of n, for all\n    integers 1 <= n <= N.\n\n    The algorithm is a sieve method analogous to the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n    It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N) and space complexity of O(N).\n\n    Args:\n        N (int): The upper limit for the computation.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of size N+1 where the element at index i\n              contains the value of omega(i).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(N, int) or N < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"N must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if N == 0:\n        return [0]\n    \n    # omega_counts[i] will store the number of distinct prime factors of i.\n    # We use a list for 1-based indexing from 1 to N.\n    omega_counts = [0] * (N + 1)\n    \n    # Iterate from 2 to N.\n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        # If omega_counts[i] is 0, it means 'i' is a prime number.\n        # This is because if 'i' were composite, it would have a prime factor p < i,\n        # and omega_counts[i] would have been incremented when the outer loop was at p.\n        if omega_counts[i] == 0:\n            # 'i' is prime.
