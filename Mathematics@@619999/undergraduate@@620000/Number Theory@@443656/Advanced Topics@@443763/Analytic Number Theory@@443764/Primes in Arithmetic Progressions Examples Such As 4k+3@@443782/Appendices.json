The premise that the sequence $10n+5$ for $n \\ge 0$ contains only one prime is correct. Let's verify this.\nThe terms of the sequence are given by $a_n = 10n+5$. We can factor out the integer $5$:\n$$a_n = 10n+5 = 5(2n+1)$$\nFor any non-negative integer $n$, the term $2n+1$ is also an integer.\n- If $n=0$, the term is $a_0 = 10(0)+5 = 5$. The number $5$ is a prime number, as its only positive divisors are $1$ and $5$.\n- If $n \\ge 1$, then $n$ is a positive integer. The factor $2n+1$ is an integer satisfying $2n+1 \\ge 2(1)+1 = 3$.\nTherefore, for any $n \\ge 1$, the term $a_n = 5(2n+1)$ is the product of two integers, $5$ and $2n+1$, both of which are greater than $1$. By definition, a number that is a product of two integers greater than $1$ is a composite number.\nThus, the only prime number in the sequence $10n+5$ with $n \\ge 0$ is $5$, which occurs at $n=0$.\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. We proceed to analyze each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For every integer $n$, one has $10n+5\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}$, so $5$ divides $10n+5$. The only way $10n+5$ can be prime is if $10n+5=5$, which occurs exactly when $n=0$.**\nThis statement presents a logical argument. Let's verify each step.\n1.  $10n+5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$: We check the congruence. $10n$ is a multiple of $5$, so $10n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. And $5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. Therefore, $10n+5 \\equiv 0+0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. This is correct.\n2.  ...so $5$ divides $10n+5$: By the definition of congruence, $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{m}$ means $m$ divides $a$. So, $5$ divides $10n+5$. This is correct.\n3.  The only way $10n+5$ can be prime is if $10n+5=5$: Let $p = 10n+5$. We know $p$ is a prime number and $5|p$. By the definition of a prime number, its only positive divisors are $1$ and itself. Since $5 > 1$, $5$ must be equal to the prime number $p$. Thus, we must have $10n+5=5$. This reasoning is sound.\n4.  ...which occurs exactly when $n=0$: Solving the equation $10n+5=5$ gives $10n=0$, which implies $n=0$. Since $n=0$ is a valid value in the domain $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$, the argument holds.\nThe entire statement is a correct and complete explanation using the allowed principles.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The terms $10n+5$ are all odd, and all odd integers greater than $5$ are composite, so there are no primes other than $5$ in the progression.**\nLet's analyze the premises.\n1.  The terms $10n+5$ are all odd: An integer $k$ is odd if it can be written as $2m+1$ for some integer $m$. We have $10n+5 = 2(5n+2)+1$. Since $5n+2$ is an integer for any integer $n$, every term is indeed odd. This part is correct.\n2.  ...all odd integers greater than $5$ are composite: This statement is false. There are infinitely many odd prime numbers greater than $5$. For example, $7$, $11$, $13$, $17$, etc., are all odd primes greater than $5$.\nSince a key premise in the argument is factually incorrect, the conclusion does not follow, and the explanation is invalid.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $a$ and $b$ satisfies $\\gcd(a,b)>1$, then every term of the progression $an+b$ is divisible by $\\gcd(a,b)$. Here $\\gcd(10,5)=5$, so each $10n+5$ is divisible by $5$, and the only prime it can equal is $5$ itself (at $n=0$).**\nThis option presents a general theorem and applies it.\n1.  The general theorem: Let $d = \\gcd(a,b)$. By definition, $d|a$ and $d|b$. From the basic properties of divisibility, if $d$ divides two integers, it also divides any integer linear combination of them. So, $d|(an+b)$ for any integer $n$. If $d>1$, this means every term of the progression has a factor $d>1$. This theorem is correct and follows directly from the definition of gcd and divisibility.\n2.  Application to the problem: Here, $a=10$ and $b=5$. We compute the greatest common divisor: $\\gcd(10,5)=5$.\n3.  Conclusion for the progression: Since $\\gcd(10,5)=5>1$, the general theorem applies. Every term $10n+5$ is divisible by $5$.\n4.  Final argument: As established in the analysis of option A, if a term in the progression is divisible by $5$ and is also prime, that term must be $5$. Setting $10n+5=5$ yields $n=0$. This is a valid value for $n$.\nThe reasoning is correct and provides a valid explanation based on fundamental number-theoretic concepts.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. By Dirichlet’s theorem on arithmetic progressions, because $\\gcd(10,5)=5>1$, the progression $10n+5$ contains infinitely many primes.**\nThis option invokes a major theorem from number theory.\nDirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions states that an arithmetic progression $an+b$ contains infinitely many primes if and only if $a$ and $b$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(a,b)=1$.\nHere, $a=10$ and $b=5$, so $\\gcd(10,5)=5$. The condition $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ is not met. Therefore, Dirichlet's theorem *does not* apply. In fact, as we showed, if $\\gcd(a,b)>1$, the progression can contain at most one prime (namely $\\gcd(a,b)$, if it is prime and appears in the sequence).\nThe statement fundamentally misunderstands and misapplies Dirichlet's theorem. The premise for applying it is incorrect, and the conclusion is the opposite of the truth.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If $n$ is prime, then $10n+5$ is prime; if $n$ is composite, then $10n+5$ is composite. Therefore, there are no primes other than $5$ in the progression.**\nThis option proposes a relationship between the primality of the index $n$ and the primality of the term $10n+5$.\n1.  \"If $n$ is prime, then $10n+5$ is prime\": Let's test this with a counterexample. Let $n=2$, which is a prime number. Then the term is $10(2)+5 = 25$. $25 = 5^2$ is a composite number, not a prime. Therefore, this part of the statement is false.\n2.  \"if $n$ is composite, then $10n+5$ is composite\": Let $n$ be a composite number. The smallest composite is $4$. If $n \\ge 4$, then $2n+1 \\ge 2(4)+1=9$. The term $10n+5 = 5(2n+1)$ is a product of two integers greater than $1$, so it is composite. This part of the statement is true.\nHowever, because the first part of the statement is false, the overall explanation is invalid. The premise is flawed, so the conclusion, even if coincidentally true, does not follow from the stated logic.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, both options A and C offer correct, logically sound explanations based on the fundamental properties of divisibility and prime numbers. Option A uses the language of congruences, while option C frames it in terms of the greatest common divisor. Both are valid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3088505"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the necessary condition for a progression to contain many primes, the next step is to put theory into practice by actively finding them.

Use only definitions and well-tested facts as a foundation: the definition of a prime number, the definition of congruence modulo $m$, and the property that if $\\gcd(a,m)=1$, then the residue class $a \\bmod m$ is coprime to $m$.

The solution involves a direct implementation of a search algorithm coupled with a primality test, both founded on the provided definitions.\n\nThe core of the methodology is a systematic search. The algorithm iterates through the elements of the arithmetic progression by starting with the integer $t=0$ and incrementing it by $1$ in each subsequent step. For each value of $t$, a candidate number $c_t$ is generated using the formula $c_t = a + t \\cdot m$.\n\nEach candidate $c_t$ is then subjected to a primality test to determine if it is a prime number. Since the search proceeds in increasing order of $t$, the first candidate found to be prime is guaranteed to be the smallest prime in the specified arithmetic progression. This search process is guaranteed to terminate successfully. A foundational result in number theory, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, states that for any two coprime integers $a$ and $m$, the arithmetic progression $a+tm$ contains infinitely many prime numbers. Therefore, a smallest prime must exist.\n\nThe primality test is derived directly from the definition of a prime number: an integer $p \\ge 2$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ and $p$. The algorithm for testing if an integer $n$ is prime is as follows:\n$1$. By definition, any integer less than $2$ is not prime. So, if $n < 2$, it is composite.\n$2$. The number $2$ is the smallest prime number.\n$3$. Any even number greater than $2$ is divisible by $2$ and is therefore not prime.\n$4$. For any odd integer $n > 2$, we must check for divisors. A key property is that if $n$ is composite, it must have a prime divisor $d$ such that $d \\le \\sqrt{n}$. This means we only need to check for divisibility by odd numbers up to $\\sqrt{n}$. The trial division procedure checks if $n$ is divisible by any odd integer $d$ in the range $3 \\le d \\le \\sqrt{n}$. If such a divisor is found, $n$ is composite. If the loop completes without finding any such divisors, $n$ is prime.\n\nThe overall algorithm for each given pair $(m,a)$ is:\n$1$. Initialize the counter $t=0$.\n$2$. Begin an indefinite loop. Inside the loop, calculate the candidate number $c = a + t \\cdot m$.\n$3$. Apply the primality test to the candidate $c$.\n$4$. If $c$ is determined to be prime, then it is the smallest prime in the progression. The value $c$ is the result for the pair $(m,a)$, and the search for this pair is terminated.\n$5$. If $c$ is not prime, increment the counter $t$ to $t+1$ and continue the loop with the next candidate.\n\nThis procedure correctly handles all cases, including those where $a$ is negative or smaller than $2$, such as in the test case $(m,a)=(7,-1)$. The first candidate, for $t=0$, is $c_0 = -1$, which is correctly identified as not prime.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nWe are given the following system of linear congruences:\n$$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$$\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nFrom the first congruence, $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we can express $x$ as $x = 4k_1 + 3$ for some integer $k_1$.\n\nWe substitute this expression into the second congruence, $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$:\n$$4k_1 + 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$$\nSubtracting $3$ from both sides gives:\n$$4k_1 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{5}$$\nSince $-2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, the congruence becomes:\n$$4k_1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$$\nTo solve for $k_1$, we need the multiplicative inverse of $4$ modulo $5$. We can find this by inspection: $4 \\times 1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, $4 \\times 2 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, $4 \\times 3 \\equiv 12 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, $4 \\times 4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. The inverse of $4$ modulo $5$ is $4$. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $4$:\n$$4(4k_1) \\equiv 4(3) \\pmod{5}$$\n$$16k_1 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$k_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$$\nThis implies that $k_1$ must be of the form $k_1 = 5k_2 + 2$ for some integer $k_2$.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $k_1$ back into our equation for $x$:\n$$x = 4(5k_2 + 2) + 3$$\n$$x = 20k_2 + 8 + 3$$\n$$x = 20k_2 + 11$$\nThis relationship, $x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{20}$, consolidates the first two congruences.\n\nNext, we use the third congruence, $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Substituting our new expression for $x$:\n$$20k_2 + 11 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$\nWe reduce the coefficients modulo $7$. Since $20 = (2 \\times 7) + 6$, we have $20 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$ or more conveniently $20 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$. Since $11 = (1 \\times 7) + 4$, we have $11 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. The congruence becomes:\n$$-k_2 + 4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$\nSubtracting $4$ from both sides:\n$$-k_2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{7}$$\nMultiplying by $-1$:\n$$k_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$\nThis means $k_2$ can be written as $k_2 = 7k_3 + 2$ for some integer $k_3$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into the expression $x = 20k_2 + 11$:\n$$x = 20(7k_3 + 2) + 11$$\n$$x = 140k_3 + 40 + 11$$\n$$x = 140k_3 + 51$$\nThis is the general form for all integers $x$ satisfying the system. Thus, the unique residue class modulo $140$ is $x \\equiv 51 \\pmod{140}$.\n\nThe least non-negative solution is found by setting $k_3 = 0$, which yields $x = 51$.\n\nThe set of non-negative solutions forms an arithmetic progression: $a_n = 51 + 140n$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. We are asked to find the least prime term in this progression.\n\nLet's test the first few terms:\nFor $n=0$: $a_0 = 51 + 140(0) = 51$. To check for primality, we see that the sum of the digits is $5+1=6$, which is divisible by $3$. Indeed, $51 = 3 \\times 17$. So, $51$ is not prime.\n\nFor $n=1$: $a_1 = 51 + 140(1) = 191$. To check if $191$ is prime, we must test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\\sqrt{191}$. We know that $13^2 = 169$ and $14^2 = 196$, so $\\sqrt{191}$ is between $13$ and $14$. We only need to test the primes less than or equal to $13$: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13$.\n-   Divisibility by $2$: $191$ is odd, so it is not divisible by $2$.\n-   Divisibility by $3$: The sum of digits is $1+9+1=11$, which is not divisible by $3$. So $191$ is not divisible by $3$.\n-   Divisibility by $5$: The last digit is $1$, not $0$ or $5$. So $191$ is not divisible by $5$.\n-   Divisibility by $7$: $191 = 7 \\times 27 + 2$. The remainder is $2$, so it is not divisible by $7$.\n-   Divisibility by $11$: $191 = 11 \\times 17 + 4$. The remainder is $4$, so it is not divisible by $11$.\n-   Divisibility by $13$: $191 = 13 \\times 14 + 9$. The remainder is $9$, so it is not divisible by $13$.\n\nSince $191$ is not divisible by any prime less than or equal to its square root, $191$ is a prime number. As this is the first prime found in the sequence (for $n=1$, after checking the non-prime term for $n=0$), it is the least prime term in the progression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{191}$$", "id": "3088517"}]}
