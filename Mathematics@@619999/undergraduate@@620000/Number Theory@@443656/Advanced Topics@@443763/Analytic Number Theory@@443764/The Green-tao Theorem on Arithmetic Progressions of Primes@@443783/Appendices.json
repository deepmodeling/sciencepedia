The validation process confirms the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no logical flaws. We may proceed with the solution, addressing each part in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Verification of the arithmetic progression $3, 5, 7$.\nAn arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let the sequence be denoted by $p_1, p_2, p_3$. For this to be an AP, we must have $p_2 - p_1 = p_3 - p_2$.\nThe given sequence is $p_1=3$, $p_2=5$, $p_3=7$.\nFirst, we verify that each term is a prime number.\n- The number $3$ is prime as its only positive divisors are $1$ and $3$.\n- The number $5$ is prime as its only positive divisors are $1$ and $5$.\n- The number $7$ is prime as its only positive divisors are $1$ and $7$.\nNext, we verify the arithmetic progression property. The common difference is calculated as:\n$p_2 - p_1 = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n$p_3 - p_2 = 7 - 5 = 2$.\nSince the differences are equal, the sequence $3, 5, 7$ is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $d=2$. Thus, it is a three-term arithmetic progression of primes.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of necessary congruence conditions on the common difference $d$.\nWe are given a three-term arithmetic progression of primes $p, p+d, p+2d$, where each term is strictly greater than $3$. Let the three primes be $p_1=p$, $p_2=p+d$, and $p_3=p+2d$.\nThe condition that all terms are primes greater than $3$ imposes strong constraints on the common difference $d$.\n\nCondition modulo $2$:\nSince $p, p+d, p+2d$ are all primes greater than $3$, they must all be odd numbers. The only even prime is $2$, which is not greater than $3$.\nThe first term, $p$, is a prime greater than $3$, so $p$ must be odd. This can be written as $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe second term, $p+d$, must also be odd. So, $p+d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Substituting $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, we get $1+d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, which implies $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. Therefore, the common difference $d$ must be an even number.\nLet's check the third term, $p+2d$. If $d$ is even, $d=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $p+2d = p+2(2k) = p+4k$. Since $p$ is odd, $p+4k$ is also odd. This is consistent with $p+2d$ being a prime greater than $3$. The condition $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ is necessary.\n\nCondition modulo $3$:\nThe terms $p, p+d, p+2d$ are primes strictly greater than $3$. This means none of them can be divisible by $3$.\nSo, $p \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $p+d \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, and $p+2d \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\nLet's consider the possible values of the common difference $d$ modulo $3$.\nCase 1: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nThe three terms of the progression, modulo $3$, are $p$, $p+1$, and $p+2$. The set $\\{p, p+1, p+2\\}$ forms a complete residue system modulo $3$. This means that regardless of the value of $p$, one of these three terms must be congruent to $0 \\pmod{3}$.\n- If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $p+2d \\equiv p+2(1) \\equiv 1+2 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n- If $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $p+d \\equiv p+1 \\equiv 2+1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n(Note that $p \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ as $p$ is a prime greater than $3$.)\nIn either subcase, one term of the progression is a multiple of $3$. Since all terms are strictly greater than $3$, that term must be composite. This contradicts the premise that all terms are prime. Therefore, we must have $d \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nCase 2: $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nThe three terms of the progression, modulo $3$, are $p$, $p+2$, and $p+2d \\equiv p+2(2) = p+4 \\equiv p+1 \\pmod{3}$.\nThe set of terms modulo $3$ is $\\{p, p+1, p+2\\}$, which is again a complete residue system modulo $3$.\n- If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $p+d \\equiv p+2 \\equiv 1+2 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n- If $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $p+2d \\equiv p+1 \\equiv 2+1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\nAgain, one term must be a multiple of $3$ and greater than $3$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have $d \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nCase 3: $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\nThe only remaining possibility is that $d$ is a multiple of $3$.\nThe three terms of the progression, modulo $3$, are $p$, $p+0$, and $p+2(0)$. That is, all three terms are congruent to $p \\pmod{3}$.\nThe condition that no term is divisible by $3$ simply reduces to the single condition $p \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. This is already guaranteed by the fact that $p$ is a prime strictly greater than $3$.\nThus, for a three-term AP of primes all greater than $3$ to exist, the common difference $d$ must be divisible by $3$. So, $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ is a necessary condition.\n\nStructural restriction on $d$:\nWe have derived two necessary conditions:\n1. $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n2. $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\nSince $2$ and $3$ are coprime, these two congruences can be combined using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. A number is divisible by both $2$ and $3$ if and only if it is divisible by their product, $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nTherefore, the structural restriction on $d$ is that it must be a multiple of $6$. This can be written as $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$.\n\nPart 3: Determine the least positive integer $d$ and provide an example.\nThe necessary condition on $d$ is that it must be a positive multiple of $6$. The set of possible values for $d$ is $\\{6, 12, 18, \\dots\\}$. The least positive integer satisfying this condition is $d=6$.\n\nNow, we must exhibit an explicit example of a three-term arithmetic progression of primes $p, p+d, p+2d$ with $d=6$ and all terms greater than $3$. The progression is of the form $p, p+6, p+12$. We need to find a prime $p > 3$ for which $p+6$ and $p+12$ are also prime.\nWe can test prime values for $p$ starting from the smallest prime greater than $3$.\n- Let $p=5$. The sequence is $5, 5+6, 5+12$, which is $5, 11, 17$. All three numbers ($5, 11, 17$) are prime, and all are greater than $3$. This is a valid example.\n- For completeness, let's check the next prime. Let $p=7$. The sequence is $7, 7+6, 7+12$, which is $7, 13, 19$. All three numbers are prime. This is another valid example.\n- Let's check $p=11$. The sequence is $11, 11+6, 11+12$, which is $11, 17, 23$. All three are prime.\n- Let's check $p=13$. The sequence is $13, 13+6, 13+12$, which is $13, 19, 25$. Here, $25 = 5^2$ is composite, so this is not an AP of primes.\n\nWe were asked for one explicit example. The first one we found, $5, 11, 17$, suffices.\nThe least positive integer $d$ satisfying the derived restrictions is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "3091314"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical insights, like the divisibility rules for the common difference, become more concrete when we see them in action.

A number $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is prime if $p \\geq 2$ and the only positive divisors of $p$ are $1$ and $p$.\n\nThe Green-Tao theorem on arithmetic progressions of primes states that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In this problem, you will address a finite-range instance inspired by this theorem: count, for a given $N$, the number of $3$-term arithmetic progressions $(a, a+d, a+2d)$ contained in $\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$ for which each of $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$ is prime.\n\nStarting from the foundational definitions above, design and implement an algorithm that, for each specified $N$, computes the number of triples $(a, a+d, a+2d)$ such that:\n- $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$ are all prime numbers,\n- $a \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$,\n- $a+d \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$,\n- $a+2d \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$,\n- $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $d > 0$.\n\nThe computation must be performed exactly and deterministically, without heuristic shortcuts, and must rely on first-principles properties of primes and arithmetic progressions.

It is scientifically grounded in number theory, well-posed with clear and consistent constraints, and expressed in objective mathematical language. A solution can be deterministically computed.\n\n### Problem Formulation\nThe objective is to count the number of $3$-term arithmetic progressions $(a, a+d, a+2d)$ where all three terms are prime numbers and are contained within the set of the first $N$ positive integers, $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The constraints are:\n1. $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$ are prime numbers.\n2. $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, $a+d \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, and $a+2d \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n3. The common difference $d$ is a positive integer, $d > 0$.\n\nThe condition $a+2d \\leq N$, combined with $a > 0$ and $d > 0$, automatically ensures that $a$ and $a+d$ are also within the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\n### Algorithmic Strategy\nA direct and exact algorithm to solve this problem consists of two main stages:\n1.  **Prime Generation:** Efficiently find all prime numbers up to the limit $N$. This pre-computation allows for constant-time primality testing for any number in the range.\n2.  **Systematic Search:** Iterate through the generated primes to identify all pairs that can serve as the first two terms of a valid arithmetic progression, and then verify the third term.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Number Generation via Sieve of Eratosthenes\nThe most suitable algorithm for generating all primes up to a given limit $N$ is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This method is highly efficient, with a time complexity of approximately $O(N \\log \\log N)$.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n- Create a boolean array, `is_prime`, of size $N+1$, and initialize all entries from index $2$ to $N$ as `true`. Mark indices $0$ and $1$ as `false`.\n- Iterate through numbers $p$ from $2$ up to $\\sqrt{N}$.\n- If `is_prime[p]` is `true`, it means $p$ is a prime number. For each such prime $p$, iterate through its multiples (starting from $p^2$) and mark them as not prime by setting `is_prime[p*p]`, `is_prime[p*p + p]`, etc., to `false`.\n\nAfter the sieve completes, `is_prime[k]` will be `true` if $k$ is a prime number and `false` otherwise, providing an $O(1)$ lookup for primality testing within our range. This boolean array is then used to generate an ordered list of all primes less than or equal to $N$, which we can denote as $P_N$.\n\n### Step 2: Searching for Arithmetic Progressions\nWith the list of primes $P_N$ and the `is_prime` array, we can systematically search for all qualifying $3$-term arithmetic progressions. Let such a progression be $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$. We can identify it by finding its first two terms.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by iterating through all ordered pairs of primes $(p_i, p_j)$ from the list $P_N$ such that $p_i  p_j$.\n- Let the first term of the progression be $a = p_i$.\n- Let the second term be $a+d = p_j$.\n- From these, the common difference is uniquely determined as $d = p_j - p_i$. Since we ensure $p_i  p_j$, the condition $d > 0$ is automatically satisfied.\n- The third term of the progression must then be $a+2d = p_j + d = p_j + (p_j - p_i) = 2p_j - p_i$. Let this candidate third term be $p_k$.\n\nFor each pair $(p_i, p_j)$, we calculate $p_k$ and check if it forms a valid progression:\n1.  **Range Check:** We must verify that $p_k \\leq N$. If this condition fails, the third term is outside the allowed set.\n2.  **Primality Check:** We must verify that $p_k$ is a prime number. This is done in constant time by checking `is_prime[p_k]`.\n\nIf both conditions are met, the triple $(p_i, p_j, p_k)$ is a valid $3$-term prime arithmetic progression. We increment a counter for each such triple found.\n\nAn optimization can be made during the search. Since the list of primes $P_N$ is sorted, for a fixed first term $p_i$, as the second term $p_j$ increases, the third term $p_k = 2p_j - p_i$ also increases. If we find a $p_j$ for which $p_k > N$, then any subsequent choice for the second term (with the same $p_i$) will also result in a third term greater than $N$. Therefore, we can break the inner loop and proceed to the next value of $p_i$.\n\nAdditionally, it can be shown that the smallest $3$-term arithmetic progression of primes is $(3, 5, 7)$. This requires $N \\geq 7$. For any $N  7$, the count is zero. This can be handled as a base case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_progressions(N: int) - int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions of primes up to N.\n\n    A 3-term arithmetic progression is (a, a+d, a+2d) where a  0, d  0,\n    and all three terms are prime and less than or equal to N.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The smallest 3-term AP of primes is (3, 5, 7), which requires N = 7.\n    if N  7:\n        return 0\n\n    # Step 1: Generate primes up to N using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n    # is_prime[i] will be True if i is prime, False otherwise.\n    is_prime = np.ones(N + 1, dtype=bool)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n    for p in range(2, int(np.sqrt(N)) + 1):\n        if is_prime[p]:\n            # Mark all multiples of p (starting from p*p) as not prime.\n            is_prime[p * p::p] = False\n\n    # Step 2: Extract the prime numbers into a sorted list.\n    primes = np.where(is_prime)[0]\n\n    # Step 3: Iterate through pairs of primes to find progressions.\n    count = 0\n    num_primes = len(primes)\n    \n    # We can skip p1=2 because (2, 2+d, 2+2d) cannot be an all-prime\n    # progression for d0.
