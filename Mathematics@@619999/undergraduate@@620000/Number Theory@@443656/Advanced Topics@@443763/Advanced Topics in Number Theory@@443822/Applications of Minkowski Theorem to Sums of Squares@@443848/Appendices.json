It is a standard problem in the geometry of numbers, which is a branch of number theory.

The condition $a^{2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ is a well-known prerequisite for expressing $p$ as a sum of two squares, which is the context for this problem.\n\nWe proceed with the three tasks required.\n\n**1. Prove that $\\Lambda$ is a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.**\n\nA subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a lattice if it is a discrete subgroup of the additive group $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, +)$. First, we demonstrate that $\\Lambda$ is a subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}, +)$. Since $(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}, +)$ is a discrete subgroup of $(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, +)$, any of its subgroups, including $\\Lambda$, will also be discrete.\n\nTo show $\\Lambda$ is a subgroup, we use the subgroup criterion.\n- The set $\\Lambda$ is non-empty because $(0,0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ and $0 \\equiv a \\cdot 0 \\pmod{p}$, so $(0,0) \\in \\Lambda$.\n- Let $v_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $v_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be two arbitrary elements of $\\Lambda$. By definition, $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ are all integers. The conditions for their membership in $\\Lambda$ are:\n  $x_1 \\equiv a y_1 \\pmod{p}$\n  $x_2 \\equiv a y_2 \\pmod{p}$\n- Consider the difference $v_1 - v_2 = (x_1 - x_2, y_1 - y_2)$. Since $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$ are integers, the components of the difference are also integers, so $v_1 - v_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\n- Now we check the congruence condition for $v_1 - v_2$:\n  $$x_1 - x_2 \\equiv a y_1 - a y_2 \\pmod{p}$$\n  $$x_1 - x_2 \\equiv a(y_1 - y_2) \\pmod{p}$$\n- This shows that $v_1 - v_2 \\in \\Lambda$. By the subgroup criterion, $\\Lambda$ is a subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}, +)$. As argued before, this implies $\\Lambda$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and is therefore a lattice.\n\nTo prove that $\\Lambda$ is a *full-rank* lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we must show that it contains two vectors that are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. This is equivalent to showing that the real vector space spanned by the elements of $\\Lambda$ is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ itself.\n\nLet's find two such vectors in $\\Lambda$.\n- Consider a vector with $y$-component $y=0$. The condition becomes $x \\equiv a \\cdot 0 \\pmod{p}$, which simplifies to $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. This means $x$ must be a multiple of $p$. The simplest non-zero integer choice is $x=p$. Thus, the vector $v_1 = (p, 0)$ is in $\\Lambda$.\n- Consider a vector with $y$-component $y=1$. The condition becomes $x \\equiv a \\cdot 1 \\pmod p$. A simple integer choice for $x$ is $x=a$. Thus, the vector $v_2 = (a, 1)$ is in $\\Lambda$.\n\nNow we check if the vectors $v_1 = (p, 0)$ and $v_2 = (a, 1)$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. We can do this by forming a matrix with these vectors and checking if its determinant is non-zero.\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} p  a \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = (p)(1) - (a)(0) = p\n$$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, $p \\neq 0$. Therefore, the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\Lambda$ contains two linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, it spans $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and is a full-rank lattice.\n\n**2. Construct an explicit $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $\\Lambda$.**\n\nWe propose that the two vectors found above, $v_1 = (p, 0)$ and $v_2 = (a, 1)$, form a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $\\Lambda$. To prove this, we must show that any vector $v = (x, y) \\in \\Lambda$ can be written as a unique integer linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n\nLet $v = (x,y)$ be an arbitrary element of $\\Lambda$. We want to find integers $c_1, c_2$ such that:\n$$ (x,y) = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 = c_1(p, 0) + c_2(a, 1) $$\nExpanding the right side gives:\n$$ (x,y) = (c_1 p + c_2 a, c_2) $$\nEquating the components, we get a system of two equations:\n1. $y = c_2$\n2. $x = c_1 p + c_2 a$\n\nFrom the first equation, $c_2 = y$. Since $v=(x,y) \\in \\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, $y$ is an integer. So $c_2$ is an integer.\nSubstituting $c_2=y$ into the second equation gives:\n$$ x = c_1 p + y a $$\n$$ c_1 p = x - ya $$\nTo find $c_1$, we must check if $x-ya$ is divisible by $p$. By the definition of $\\Lambda$, since $(x,y) \\in \\Lambda$, we have $x \\equiv ya \\pmod{p}$. This means that $x-ya$ is an integer multiple of $p$. Let $x - ya = k p$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $c_1 p = kp$, which implies $c_1 = k$. Since $k$ is an integer, $c_1$ is also an integer.\nThus, for any $v=(x,y) \\in \\Lambda$, we can find unique integers $c_1 = \\frac{x-ya}{p}$ and $c_2 = y$ such that $v = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2$.\nThis proves that the set $\\{v_1, v_2\\} = \\{(p, 0), (a, 1)\\}$ constitutes a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for the lattice $\\Lambda$.\n\n**3. Compute the determinant $\\det(\\Lambda)$ directly from your basis.**\n\nThe determinant of a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (also known as its covolume) is defined as the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix whose rows (or columns) are the basis vectors of the lattice.\nUsing the basis we constructed, $v_1 = (p, 0)$ and $v_2 = (a, 1)$, we form the basis matrix $B$:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} p  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$ \\det(B) = (p)(1) - (0)(a) = p $$\nThe determinant of the lattice $\\Lambda$ is the absolute value of $\\det(B)$:\n$$ \\det(\\Lambda) = |\\det(B)| = |p| $$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, it is positive. Therefore, $|p| = p$.\nThe determinant of the lattice $\\Lambda$ is $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p}$$", "id": "3081185"}, {"introduction": "Abstract proofs become clear when seen through a concrete example. This practice walks you through the entire process for the prime $p=29$, from finding a modular square root of $-1$ to applying Minkowski's theorem with a specific convex body.

The procedure is broken down into four steps, which we will follow methodically.\n\nFirst, we validate the premise that the congruence $u^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ has a solution. We are given $p=29$. This prime satisfies $29 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. By Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares (or more elementarily, by properties of quadratic residues), the congruence $u^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ is guaranteed to have a solution in integers. For $p=29$, we need to find an integer $u$ such that $u^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{29}$, or $u^2 \\equiv 28 \\pmod{29}$. By testing small integer values, we find $12^2 = 144$. Dividing $144$ by $29$ gives $144 = 4 \\times 29 + 28$. Thus, $12^2 \\equiv 28 \\pmod{29}$, and we can choose $u=12$.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Lattice $\\Lambda$**\n\nWe need to construct a full-rank lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ with determinant $p=29$, such that any integer vector $(x,y) \\in \\Lambda$ satisfies $x^2+y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{29}$.\nThe congruence $x^2+y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ can be rewritten using our value of $u$:\n$x^2 - u^2y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\implies (x-uy)(x+uy) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nThis congruence holds if $x \\equiv uy \\pmod{p}$ or $x \\equiv -uy \\pmod{p}$. We can choose one of these conditions to define our lattice. Let's choose $x \\equiv uy \\pmod{p}$. With $u=12$ and $p=29$, the condition is $x \\equiv 12y \\pmod{29}$.\n\nA lattice is the set of all integer linear combinations of a set of basis vectors. We seek a basis $\\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2\\}$ for the set of integer vectors $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ satisfying $x \\equiv 12y \\pmod{29}$.\nA point in the lattice is of the form $\\mathbf{v} = (x,y) = a\\mathbf{v}_1 + b\\mathbf{v}_2$ for integers $a, b$.\nLet's construct a basis. The condition $x - 12y = 29k$ for some integer $k$ defines the set of points.\nOne obvious vector satisfying this is $(29,0)$, since $29 - 12(0) = 29(1)$. So we can take $\\mathbf{v}_1 = (29, 0)$.\nAnother simple vector is found by setting $y=1$ and finding the smallest non-negative $x$ that satisfies $x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{29}$. This is $x=12$. So, the vector $(12,1)$ satisfies the congruence. Let's choose $\\mathbf{v}_2 = (12,1)$.\n\nThe lattice $\\Lambda$ is the set of all integer linear combinations of these vectors:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\{ a(29, 0) + b(12, 1) \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} $$\nAny vector $(x,y) \\in \\Lambda$ can be written as $(x,y) = (29a+12b, b)$. For such a vector, let's verify the congruence:\n$x - 12y = (29a+12b) - 12(b) = 29a$.\nSince $29a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{29}$, we have $x \\equiv 12y \\pmod{29}$, which implies $x^2 \\equiv 144y^2 \\equiv -y^2 \\pmod{29}$, and thus $x^2+y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{29}$. The lattice correctly encodes the constraint.\n\nThe determinant of the lattice, $\\det(\\Lambda)$, is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the basis vectors:\n$$ \\det(\\Lambda) = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 29  0 \\\\ 12  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = |29 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 12| = 29 $$\nSo $\\det(\\Lambda)=p=29$, as required.\n\n**Step 2: Select a Convex Body and Apply Minkowski's Theorem**\n\nWe must select a centrally symmetric convex square $B \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ whose area is strictly greater than $4 \\det(\\Lambda)$. Minkowski's second theorem states that for a centrally symmetric convex body $B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, if $\\text{Area}(B) > 4 \\det(\\Lambda)$, then $B$ must contain at least one non-zero point of $\\Lambda$.\n\nLet $B$ be an open square centered at the origin, defined by $B = \\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid |x|  s, |y|  s \\}$ for some real number $s$. This set is convex and centrally symmetric.\nIts area is $\\text{Area}(B) = (2s)^2 = 4s^2$.\nThe condition from Minkowski's theorem is $4s^2 > 4 \\det(\\Lambda) = 4p = 4(29) = 116$.\nThis simplifies to $s^2 > 29$.\nTo satisfy the next step of the problem, we need to choose $s$ judiciously. Let's make a specific choice. We need $s > \\sqrt{29} \\approx 5.385$. Let's choose $s=5.5$, which gives $s^2 = 30.25$.\nSince $30.25 > 29$, the condition $s^2 > p$ is satisfied. With this choice, $\\text{Area}(B) = 4(30.25) = 121 > 116$.\nMinkowski's theorem guarantees the existence of a non-zero integer vector $(x,y) \\in \\Lambda \\cap B$.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce $x^2+y^2=p$**\n\nThe non-zero vector $(x,y)$ found in Step 2 has integer coordinates and belongs to both the lattice $\\Lambda$ and the square $B$.\n- Since $(x,y) \\in B$, we have $|x|  5.5$ and $|y|  5.5$. Because $x$ and $y$ are integers, these inequalities imply $|x| \\le 5$ and $|y| \\le 5$.\n- From these integer bounds, we can bound the sum of squares: $x^2 \\le 25$ and $y^2 \\le 25$, so $x^2+y^2 \\le 25+25=50$.\n- Since $(x,y) \\in \\Lambda$, we know that $x^2+y^2$ must be a multiple of $p=29$. So, $x^2+y^2 = k \\cdot 29$ for some integer $k$.\n- Since $(x,y)$ is a non-zero vector, $(x,y) \\ne (0,0)$, which means $x^2+y^2 > 0$. Thus, $k$ must be a positive integer, $k \\ge 1$.\n\nCombining the conditions, we have $x^2+y^2 = 29k \\le 50$.\nThe only positive integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $k=1$.\nTherefore, we must have $x^2+y^2=29$.\n\nThis result, $x^2+y^2=29$, satisfies the condition $0  x^2+y^2  2p$ because $0  29  2(29)=58$. The choice of the square $B$ with side length parameter $s=5.5$ has forced the desired conclusion.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Explicit Integer Pair**\n\nWe need to find an explicit non-zero vector $(x,y) \\in \\Lambda$ that lies within our square $B$. A vector in $\\Lambda$ has the form $(x,y) = (29a+12b, b)$ for integers $a, b$. The conditions are $|x| \\le 5$ and $|y| \\le 5$.\nThe condition $|y| \\le 5$ translates to $|b| \\le 5$. We search for integer pairs $(a,b)$ (not both zero) satisfying these constraints.\nLet's test values of $b$ from $1$ to $5$:\n- If $b=1$: $|29a+12| \\le 5 \\implies -17 \\le 29a \\le -7$. No integer solution for $a$.\n- If $b=2$: $|29a+24| \\le 5 \\implies -29 \\le 29a \\le -19$. This implies $a=-1$.\n  Let's check this pair $(a,b)=(-1,2)$:\n  $x = 29(-1) + 12(2) = -29+24 = -5$.\n  $y = b = 2$.\n  The vector is $(-5, 2)$. This is a non-zero vector. Its coordinates satisfy $|-5| \\le 5$ and $|2| \\le 5$. Its sum of squares is $(-5)^2+2^2 = 25+4=29$. This is one such vector.\n- If $b=3$: $|29a+36| \\le 5 \\implies -41 \\le 29a \\le -31$. No integer solution for $a$.\n- If $b=4$: $|29a+48| \\le 5 \\implies -53 \\le 29a \\le -43$. No integer solution for $a$.\n- If $b=5$: $|29a+60| \\le 5 \\implies -65 \\le 29a \\le -55$. This implies $a=-2$.\n  Let's check this pair $(a,b)=(-2,5)$:\n  $x=29(-2)+12(5) = -58+60 = 2$.\n  $y=b=5$.\n  The vector is $(2,5)$. This is a non-zero vector. Its coordinates satisfy $|2|\\le 5$ and $|5|\\le 5$. Its sum of squares is $2^2+5^2=4+25=29$.\n\nWe have found two candidate pairs (up to signs and order): $(2,5)$ and $(5,2)$. The problem asks for the pair $(x,y)$ with minimal nonnegative coordinates. The pairs with non-negative coordinates are $(2,5)$ from $(a,b)=(-2,5)$ and potentially others by changing $u$. In our construction, we found $(2,5)$. By convention, we list the smaller coordinate first.\n\nThe pair $(2,5)$ with $x=2$ and $y=5$ consists of non-negative integers, satisfies $2^2+5^2=29$, and arose from our systematic search for a point guaranteed by Minkowski's theorem.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2  5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3081193"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a constructive proof lies in its ability to be implemented as an algorithm.

Starting from $(\\mathbf{b}_1,\\mathbf{b}_2)$, repeatedly perform:\n  - If $\\|\\mathbf{b}_2\\|  \\|\\mathbf{b}_1\\|$, swap them.\n  - Set $\\mu = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\langle \\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2 \\rangle}{\\|\\mathbf{b}_1\\|^2} \\right\\rceil$ (nearest integer), and replace $\\mathbf{b}_2 \\leftarrow \\mathbf{b}_2 - \\mu \\mathbf{b}_1$.\n  - Terminate when $|\\langle \\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2 \\rangle| \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{b}_1\\|^2$ and $\\|\\mathbf{b}_1\\| \\le \\|\\mathbf{b}_2\\|$.\n- The resulting first basis vector is a shortest nonzero vector in the lattice in two dimensions. By the Minkowski argument above, its squared norm is strictly less than $2p$, so it yields $x^2 + y^2 = p$.\n\nStep 5: Canonicalization.\n- To make the output unique, transform $(x,y)$ by sign changes and, if needed, swapping coordinates so that $x \\ge 0$, $y \\ge 0$, and $x \\le y$.\n\nAlgorithm summary integrating principles with computation:\n- Use Tonelli–Shanks on $n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ to find $a$ with $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n- Form the lattice basis $\\mathbf{b}_1 = (a,1)$, $\\mathbf{b}_2 = (p,0)$.\n- Apply Gauss reduction to obtain a shortest nonzero vector $(x,y)$ in $\\Lambda$.\n- By the modular property and Minkowski’s bound, verify $x^2 + y^2 = p$.\n- Canonicalize $(x,y)$ to nonnegative, ordered form.\n\nCorrectness justification:\n- Existence of $a$ follows from $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and Euler's criterion; Tonelli–Shanks computes it in polynomial time in $\\log p$.\n- The lattice $\\Lambda$ has covolume $p$; by Minkowski, there is a nonzero point with squared norm less than $2p$.\n- For such $(x,y)$, $x^2 + y^2$ is a positive multiple of $p$ less than $2p$, hence equal to $p$.\n- Gauss reduction finds the shortest vector in two dimensions, so it finds a vector achieving the strict bound.\n\nTest suite and output:\n- Apply the algorithm to $p \\in \\{5, 13, 29, 37, 97, 101\\}$.\n- Output a single line string that is a Python list of the pairs $[x,y]$ (with $x \\ge 0$, $y \\ge 0$, $x \\le y$) in the same order as the primes listed.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef legendre_symbol(a, p):\n    # Returns 1 if a is a quadratic residue mod p, -1 if non-residue, 0 if a % p == 0.\n    ls = pow(a % p, (p - 1) // 2, p)\n    if ls == 0:\n        return 0\n    return -1 if ls == p - 1 else 1\n\ndef tonelli_shanks(n, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solve x^2 ≡ n (mod p) for odd prime p using the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm.\n    Returns a solution x in [0, p-1], or None if no solution exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert p  2 and p % 2 == 1\n    n %= p\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if p == 2:\n        return n\n    if legendre_symbol(n, p) != 1:\n        return None\n\n    # Factor p-1 as Q*2^S with Q odd\n    Q = p - 1\n    S = 0\n    while Q % 2 == 0:\n        Q //= 2\n        S += 1\n\n    # Find a quadratic nonresidue z\n    z = 2\n    while legendre_symbol(z, p) != -1:\n        z += 1\n\n    # Initialize variables\n    M = S\n    c = pow(z, Q, p)\n    t = pow(n, Q, p)\n    R = pow(n, (Q + 1) // 2, p)\n\n    # Main loop\n    while t != 1:\n        # Find the least i (0  i  M) such that t^(2^i) ≡ 1 mod p\n        i = 1\n        t2i = pow(t, 2, p)\n        while t2i != 1:\n            i += 1\n            t2i = pow(t2i, 2, p)\n            if i == M:\n                # This should not happen if n is a residue\n                return None\n        # Compute b = c^{2^{M-i-1}}\n        b = c\n        for _ in range(M - i - 1):\n            b = pow(b, 2, p)\n        # Update state\n        R = (R * b) % p\n        t = (t * pow(b, 2, p)) % p\n        c = pow(b, 2, p)\n        M = i\n    return R\n\ndef gauss_reduce_2d(b1, b2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gauss reduction for 2D lattice basis.\n    Input: b1, b2 as tuples or lists of integers.\n    Output: reduced basis (u, v) with u being (a) shortest (in 2D gauss reduction),\n            and inner product condition satisfied.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Represent as floats for inner products, but maintain integers for updates.\n    x1, y1 = b1\n    x2, y2 = b2\n\n    def norm2(u):\n        return u[0] * u[0] + u[1] * u[1]\n\n    def dot(u, v):\n        return u[0] * v[0] + u[1] * v[1]\n\n    u = [int(x1), int(y1)]\n    v = [int(x2), int(y2)]\n\n    changed = True\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        # Ensure ||u|| = ||v||\n        if norm2(v)  norm2(u):\n            u, v = v, u\n            changed = True\n        # Compute mu = round(u,v/||u||^2)\n        # Protect against division by zero (should not happen if lattice basis nonzero)\n        u_norm2 = norm2(u)\n        if u_norm2 == 0:\n            # Degenerate;
