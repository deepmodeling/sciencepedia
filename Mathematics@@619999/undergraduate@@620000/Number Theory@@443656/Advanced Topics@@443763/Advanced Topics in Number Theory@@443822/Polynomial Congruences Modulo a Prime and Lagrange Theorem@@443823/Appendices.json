The constraints on the method of solution are clear and do not introduce any ambiguity or contradiction. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe congruence $x^{6} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$ seeks solutions for $x$ in the set of integers modulo $19$, which forms the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$. We first check if $x=0$ is a solution. Substituting $x=0$ gives $0^{6} = 0$, and since $0 \\not\\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$, $x=0$ is not a solution. Therefore, any solution must be a non-zero element of $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$, which means it must belong to the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$ is a cyclic group of order $18$. Let us analyze the problem from a group theory perspective. We define a map $\\phi: \\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times \\to \\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$ by $\\phi(x) = x^{6}$. This map is a group homomorphism, because for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$, $\\phi(xy) = (xy)^{6} = x^{6}y^{6} = \\phi(x)\\phi(y)$, since the group is abelian.\n\nThe problem of solving $x^{6} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$ is equivalent to determining if $5$ is in the image of the homomorphism $\\phi$, denoted $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$. The image $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is the set of all $6$-th powers in $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$, and it forms a subgroup of $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$.\n\nTo understand the structure of this subgroup, we use the properties of cyclic groups and Lagrange's theorem. For a homomorphism $\\phi$ on a finite group $G$, Lagrange's theorem implies the relation $|G| = |\\text{Im}(\\phi)| \\cdot |\\text{Ker}(\\phi)|$. Here, $G = \\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$, so $|G|=18$.\n\nThe kernel of $\\phi$, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$, is the set of elements $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$ such that $\\phi(x) = x^{6} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$. The number of solutions to $x^d \\equiv 1$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is given by $\\gcd(d, n)$. In our case, $d=6$ and $n=18$.\nThe size of the kernel is $|\\text{Ker}(\\phi)| = \\gcd(6, 18) = 6$.\n\nUsing the relation from Lagrange's theorem, we can determine the size of the image subgroup:\n$$|\\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times| = |\\text{Im}(\\phi)| \\cdot |\\text{Ker}(\\phi)|$$\n$$18 = |\\text{Im}(\\phi)| \\cdot 6$$\nThis yields $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)| = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$.\nSo, the subgroup of $6$-th powers in $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$ has order $3$. In the cyclic group $\\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$ of order $18$, there is a unique subgroup of order $3$.\n\nFor the congruence $x^{6} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$ to have a solution, the element $5$ must be a member of this unique subgroup of order $3$, $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$.\n\nWe invoke Lagrange's theorem again: if an element is part of a subgroup, the order of that element must divide the order of the subgroup. Thus, if $5 \\in \\text{Im}(\\phi)$, then the multiplicative order of $5$ modulo $19$, denoted $\\text{ord}_{19}(5)$, must divide the order of the subgroup $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$, which is $3$.\nThe condition that $\\text{ord}_{19}(5)$ divides $3$ is equivalent to the mathematical statement $5^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$.\n\nWe now compute $5^3 \\pmod{19}$ to verify this condition:\n$$5^1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$$\n$$5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{19}$$\n$$5^3 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 6 = 30 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{19}$$\n\nSince $5^3 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{19}$, and $11 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$, the condition is not met. The order of $5$ does not divide $3$. This demonstrates, by contradiction, that $5$ cannot be an element of the subgroup of $6$-th powers, $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$.\n\nTherefore, there is no element $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{19}^\\times$ such that $x^6 = 5$. The number of solutions to the congruence is $0$.\n\nThis completes the justification. The count of solutions is $0$, and this is justified by showing that $5$ is not a member of the subgroup of $6$-th powers, a conclusion reached by applying Lagrange's theorem and the properties of cyclic groups.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3088255"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, we now move from determining the *existence* of roots to finding them explicitly.

The tasks involve applying Lagrange's theorem for polynomials, finding the roots of $f(x)$ by direct evaluation, and corroborating these roots by computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $f(x)$ with $x^{7} - x$. All calculations will be performed modulo $7$.\n\n**Part 1: Application of Lagrange's Theorem**\n\nThe congruence $x^{4} + x^{3} + 3x + 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = x^{4} + x^{3} + 3x + 5$ in the field $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$. The polynomial $f(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial, and its degree is $\\deg(f) = 4$.\n\nThe problem statement cites a key result from field theory, often referred to as Lagrange's theorem for polynomials: a nonzero polynomial of degree $d$ over a field has at most $d$ roots in that field. In this context, the field is $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$ and the polynomial $f(x)$ has degree $d=4$. Therefore, the number of solutions to the equation $f(x) = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$ is at most $4$. This provides a strict upper bound on the number of solutions to the given congruence.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of Roots by Direct Evaluation**\n\nWe evaluate $f(x)$ for each element $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{7} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n*   For $x=0$: $f(0) = 0^{4} + 0^{3} + 3(0) + 5 = 5 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\n*   For $x=1$: $f(1) = 1^{4} + 1^{3} + 3(1) + 5 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n*   For $x=2$: $f(2) = 2^{4} + 2^{3} + 3(2) + 5 = 16 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 35 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. Thus, $x=2$ is a solution.\n*   For $x=3$: $f(3) = 3^{4} + 3^{3} + 3(3) + 5 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 5 \\equiv 4 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n*   For $x=4$: $f(4) = 4^{4} + 4^{3} + 3(4) + 5 = 256 + 64 + 12 + 5 \\equiv 4 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n*   For $x=5$: It is computationally simpler to use $x=5 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{7}$.\n    $f(5) = (-2)^{4} + (-2)^{3} + 3(-2) + 5 = 16 - 8 - 6 + 5 = 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.

This means that the polynomial $g(x) = x^{7} - x$ has every element of $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$ as a root. The roots of $\\gcd(f(x), g(x))$ are exactly the common roots of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Since any root of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$ is, by definition, an element of $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$, it must also be a root of $g(x)$. Therefore, the set of roots of $\\gcd(f(x), g(x))$ is precisely the set of roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$.\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. Let $f(x) = x^{4} + x^{3} + 3x + 5$ and $g(x) = x^{7} - x$.\nFirst, we find the remainder of $g(x)$ when divided by $f(x)$. Since $g(x) \\equiv (x^7-x) \\pmod{f(x)}$, we compute powers of $x$ modulo $f(x)$. From $f(x)=0$, we have $x^4 \\equiv -x^3 - 3x - 5 \\equiv 6x^3+4x+2 \\pmod 7$.\nBy repeated substitution:\n$x^5 \\equiv x(x^4) \\equiv x(6x^3+4x+2) = 6x^4+4x^2+2x \\equiv 6(6x^3+4x+2)+4x^2+2x = 36x^3+4x^2+24x+12+2x \\equiv x^3+4x^2+5x+5$.\n$x^6 \\equiv x(x^5) \\equiv x(x^3+4x^2+5x+5) = x^4+4x^3+5x^2+5x \\equiv (6x^3+4x+2)+4x^3+5x^2+5x = 10x^3+5x^2+9x+2 \\equiv 3x^3+5x^2+2x+2$.\n$x^7 \\equiv x(x^6) \\equiv x(3x^3+5x^2+2x+2) = 3x^4+5x^3+2x^2+2x \\equiv 3(6x^3+4x+2)+5x^3+2x^2+2x = 18x^3+12x+6+5x^3+2x^2+2x \\equiv 23x^3+2x^2+14x+6 \\equiv 2x^3+2x^2+6$.\nSo, $x^7 - x \\equiv (2x^3+2x^2+6) - x = 2x^3+2x^2-x+6 \\pmod{f(x)}$.\nLet this remainder be $r_1(x) = 2x^3+2x^2-x+6$.\nNow, $\\gcd(f(x), g(x)) = \\gcd(f(x), r_1(x))$.\n\nNext, we divide $f(x)$ by $r_1(x)$. To avoid fractions, we can divide $2f(x) = 2x^4+2x^3+6x+10 \\equiv 2x^4+2x^3+6x+3$ by $r_1(x)$.\nUsing polynomial long division:\n$(2x^4+2x^3+6x+3) = x \\cdot (2x^3+2x^2-x+6) + (2x^3 - 2x^3 - x^2 - 6x + 6x + 3) = x \\cdot r_1(x) + x^2+3$.\nThe remainder is $r_2(x) = x^2+3$.\nNow, $\\gcd(f(x), r_1(x)) = \\gcd(r_1(x), r_2(x))$.\n\nFinally, we divide $r_1(x)$ by $r_2(x)$:\n$r_1(x) = 2x^3+2x^2-x+6$. By long division:\n$(2x^3+2x^2-x+6) = (2x) \\cdot (x^2+3) + (2x^2-x+6 - 6x) = (2x)(x^2+3) + 2x^2-7x+6 \\equiv (2x)(x^2+3) + 2x^2+6$.\nContinuing, $2x^2+6 = 2(x^2+3)$.\nSo, $r_1(x) = (2x)(x^2+3) + 2(x^2+3) = (2x+2)(x^2+3)$.\nThe division is exact, so the remainder is $0$. The last non-zero remainder, made monic, is $r_2(x) = x^2+3$.\n\nThus, $\\gcd(f(x), x^7-x) = x^2+3$.\nThe roots of this GCD polynomial are the values of $x$ for which $x^2+3=0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$. This is equivalent to $x^2 \\equiv -3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. The solutions are $x=2$ (since $2^{2}=4$) and $x=-2 \\equiv 5$ (since $5^{2}=25 \\equiv 4$).\nThe roots of the GCD are $\\{2, 5\\}$, which is precisely the set of solutions found by direct evaluation in Part 2. This corroborates the result. The GCD factors as $(x-2)(x-5)$, which are the linear factors corresponding to the roots.\n\nThe complete list of solutions is $\\{2, 5\\}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3088227"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a mathematical theorem involves not only knowing when it applies but also why it fails when its conditions are not met.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first part of the problem requires an explanation for why Lagrange's theorem for polynomials, which holds over fields, can fail over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe proof of Lagrange's theorem over a field $F$ relies on a crucial property of fields: they are integral domains. An integral domain is a commutative ring with identity where for any two elements $a, b$, if $a \\cdot b = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.\nLet $f(X)$ be a polynomial in $F[X]$ of degree $d \\ge 1$. If $a_1 \\in F$ is a root of $f(X)$, i.e., $f(a_1) = 0$, then by the polynomial division algorithm, $f(X)$ can be factored as $f(X) = (X - a_1)q(X)$ for some polynomial $q(X)$ of degree $d-1$. If $a_2 \\in F$ is another distinct root ($a_2 \\neq a_1$), then substituting it into the factored form gives $f(a_2) = (a_2 - a_1)q(a_2) = 0$. Since $a_1 \\neq a_2$, the term $a_2 - a_1$ is a non-zero element of the field $F$. Because $F$ is an integral domain, the product being zero implies that $q(a_2)$ must be zero. This means $a_2$ is a root of $q(X)$. By induction, if $f(X)$ has $k$ distinct roots $a_1, \\dots, a_k$, then $f(X)$ must be divisible by the product $(X - a_1) \\cdots (X - a_k)$, a polynomial of degree $k$. Consequently, the degree of $f(X)$ must be at least $k$, so $d \\ge k$.\n\nThis argument breaks down for the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z}$. For any prime $p$, $R$ is not an integral domain. Specifically, the element representing the congruence class of $p$, which we denote by $[p]$, is a non-zero element of $R$ since $p$ is not divisible by $p^2$. However, $[p] \\cdot [p] = [p^2] = [0]$ in $R$. So, $[p]$ is a zero divisor. The existence of zero divisors invalidates the key step in the proof of Lagrange's theorem. It becomes possible to have an equation like $(a_2-a_1)q(a_2) = 0$ where neither $a_2-a_1$ nor $q(a_2)$ is zero.\n\nTo construct a concrete example, we consider the congruence $px \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$ mentioned in the problem. This corresponds to finding the roots of the polynomial $f(X) = pX$ in the polynomial ring $R[X] = (\\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z})[X]$.\nThe coefficient of $X$ is $[p] \\in R$. Since $p$ is prime, $p$ is not a multiple of $p^2$, so $[p] \\neq [0]$ in $R$. Therefore, $f(X) = pX$ is a nonzero polynomial. Its degree is $d=1$.\n\nNow, we must find the number of distinct roots of this polynomial in $R$. A root is an element $x \\in R$ such that $f(x)=0$ in $R$. This is equivalent to solving the congruence:\n$$\npx \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}\n$$\nThe elements of $R$ can be represented by the integers $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, p^2-1\\}$. The congruence means that $p^2$ divides the integer $px$. This can be written as $px = k p^2$ for some integer $k$.\nSince $p$ is a prime, we know $p \\neq 0$, so we can divide the integer equation by $p$:\n$$\nx = kp\n$$\nThis equation shows that any solution $x$ must be an integer multiple of $p$. We need to find how many such distinct multiples exist in the set of representatives $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, p^2-1\\}$.\nLet $x = m \\cdot p$ for some integer $m$. We require that $0 \\le x  p^2$, so:\n$$\n0 \\le m \\cdot p  p^2\n$$\nSince $p$ is a positive integer, we can divide the inequality by $p$ without changing the direction of the inequalities:\n$$\n0 \\le m  p\n$$\nThe integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\nEach of these values of $m$ gives a distinct solution for $x$ in $R$:\n- For $m=0$, $x_0 = 0 \\cdot p = 0$.\n- For $m=1$, $x_1 = 1 \\cdot p = p$.\n- For $m=2$, $x_2 = 2 \\cdot p = 2p$.\n- ...\n- For $m=p-1$, $x_{p-1} = (p-1)p = p^2 - p$.\n\nThese $p$ solutions are all distinct modulo $p^2$. To verify this, suppose $m_1 p \\equiv m_2 p \\pmod{p^2}$ for $0 \\le m_1, m_2  p$. This would imply $p^2 | (m_1 - m_2)p$, which in turn implies $p | (m_1 - m_2)$. Since $|m_1 - m_2|  p$, the only multiple of $p$ this difference can be is $0$. Thus, $m_1 - m_2 = 0$, which means $m_1 = m_2$.\nSo, there are exactly $p$ distinct solutions to the congruence $px \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(X) = pX$ has degree $d=1$. The number of its distinct roots in $R$ is $p$. Since $p$ is a prime, $p \\ge 2$. Therefore, the number of roots, $p$, is strictly greater than the degree, $1$. This explicitly constructs a polynomial over $R$ that violates the bound from Lagrange's theorem.\n\nThe second part of the question asks for the exact number of distinct solutions $x \\in R$ to the congruence $px \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$.
