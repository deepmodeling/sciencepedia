A Weierstrass model with integer coefficients is minimal at an odd prime $\\ell$ if $v_{\\ell}(\\Delta) < 12$ or $v_{\\ell}(c_4) < 4$. As we have shown $v_{\\ell}(c_{4})=0$ for any odd prime $\\ell \\mid abc$, the condition $v_{\\ell}(c_4) < 4$ is satisfied. This implies that the given model $y^{2} = x \\bigl(x - a^{p}\\bigr)\\bigl(x + b^{p}\\bigr)$ is a minimal Weierstrass model at $\\ell$.\nTherefore, the minimal discriminant $\\Delta_{\\min}$ is equal to the discriminant of our model, $\\Delta$.\n$\\Delta_{\\min} = \\Delta = 16(abc)^{2p}$.\nThe valuation of the minimal discriminant is:\n$v_{\\ell}(\\Delta_{\\min}) = v_{\\ell}(\\Delta) = v_{\\ell}(16(abc)^{2p}) = v_{\\ell}(16) + 2p \\cdot v_{\\ell}(abc) = 0 + 2p \\cdot v_{\\ell}(abc) = 2p \\cdot v_{\\ell}(abc)$.\n\nCombining our results, the minimal discriminant valuation is $v_{\\ell}(\\Delta_{\\min}) = 2p \\cdot v_{\\ell}(abc)$ and the conductor exponent is $f_{\\ell}=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2p \\, v_{\\ell}(abc) & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3083693"}, {"introduction": "The Modularity Theorem states that an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is associated with a modular form, and this connection is forged by a sequence of integers $(a_p)$ that serve as the Fourier coefficients of the form.

Since the matrix $-I = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is in $\\Gamma_0(N)$ for all $N \\ge 1$, this index is equal to $[\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}): \\Gamma_0(N)]$. The formula for this index is:\n    $$d_N = N \\prod_{p|N} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{p}\\right)$$\n    where the product is over the distinct prime divisors of $N$.\n\n2.  The number of inequivalent elliptic points of order $2$, $\\nu_2(N)$, is given by:\n    $$\\nu_2(N) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } 4|N \\\\ \\prod_{p|N} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right)\\right) & \\text{if } 4 \\nmid N \\end{cases}$$\n    Here, $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$ is the Legendre symbol, and by convention $\\left(\\frac{-1}{2}\\right) = 0$.\n\n3.  The number of inequivalent elliptic points of order $3$, $\\nu_3(N)$, is given by:\n    $$\\nu_3(N) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } 9|N \\text{ or if there is a prime } p|N \\text{ with } p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3 \\\\ \\prod_{p|N} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{-3}{p}\\right)\\right) & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n    By convention, $\\left(\\frac{-3}{3}\\right)=0$.\n\n4.  The number of cusps, $\\nu_\\infty(N)$, is given by the formula:\n    $$\\nu_\\infty(N) = \\sum_{d|N} \\phi\\left(\\gcd(d, \\frac{N}{d})\\right)$$\n    where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\nWe now apply these formulas for $N = 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n**Case $N=1$:**\n$\\Gamma_0(1) = \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n-   Degree: $d_1 = 1$.\n-   Elliptic points of order $2$: $\\nu_2(1) = 1$ (from the empty product).\n-   Elliptic points of order $3$: $\\nu_3(1) = 1$ (from the empty product).\n-   Cusps: $\\nu_\\infty(1) = \\phi(\\gcd(1,1)) = \\phi(1) = 1$.\n-   Genus: $g(X_0(1)) = 1 + \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1 - 3 - 4 - 6}{12} = 1 - \\frac{12}{12} = 0$.\nThus, $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(1)) = 0$.\n\n**Case $N=2$:**\n-   Degree: $d_2 = 2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 3$.\n-   Elliptic points of order $2$: $4 \\nmid 2$. $\\nu_2(2) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{2}\\right) = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n-   Elliptic points of order $3$: The prime divisor is $p=2$, and $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. So, $\\nu_3(2) = 0$.\n-   Cusps: $\\nu_\\infty(2) = \\phi(\\gcd(1,2)) + \\phi(\\gcd(2,1)) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n-   Genus: $g(X_0(2)) = 1 + \\frac{3}{12} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{0}{3} - \\frac{2}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} - 1 = 0$.\nThus, $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(2)) = 0$.\n\n**Case $N=3$:**\n-   Degree: $d_3 = 3 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 4$.\n-   Elliptic points of order $2$: $4 \\nmid 3$. $\\nu_2(3) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n-   Elliptic points of order $3$: $9 \\nmid 3$ and the only prime divisor is $3 \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. So, $\\nu_3(3) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{-3}{3}\\right) = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n-   Cusps: $\\nu_\\infty(3) = \\phi(\\gcd(1,3)) + \\phi(\\gcd(3,1)) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n-   Genus: $g(X_0(3)) = 1 + \\frac{4}{12} - \\frac{0}{4} - \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} - 0 - \\frac{1}{3} - 1 = 0$.\nThus, $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(3)) = 0$.\n\n**Case $N=4$:**\n-   Degree: $d_4 = 4 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 6$.\n-   Elliptic points of order $2$: $4|4$. So, $\\nu_2(4) = 0$.\n-   Elliptic points of order $3$: The prime divisor is $p=2$, and $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. So, $\\nu_3(4) = 0$.\n-   Cusps: $\\nu_\\infty(4) = \\phi(\\gcd(1,4)) + \\phi(\\gcd(2,2)) + \\phi(\\gcd(4,1)) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) + \\phi(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n-   Genus: $g(X_0(4)) = 1 + \\frac{6}{12} - \\frac{0}{4} - \\frac{0}{3} - \\frac{3}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} - 0 - 0 - \\frac{3}{2} = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nThus, $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(4)) = 0$.\n\nIn all four cases, the computation of the genus of $X_0(N)$ yields $0$. Therefore, the dimension of the space of weight $2$ cusp forms, $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(N))$, is $0$ for $N=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nThe absence of weight $2$ cusp forms at these small levels, particularly level $N=2$, is central to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT). The strategy, due to Frey, Serre, and Ribet, and completed by Wiles, proceeds by contradiction:\n1.  Assume a non-trivial integer solution $(A, B, C)$ to $A^p + B^p + C^p = 0$ exists for a prime $p \\ge 5$.\n2.  Construct the Frey-Hellegouarch elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x(x-A^p)(x+B^p)$.\n3.  The Modularity Theorem (proven by Wiles et al.) states that this curve $E$ must be modular, meaning it corresponds to a weight $2$ newform $f$ of level $N_E$, where $N_E$ is the conductor of $E$.\n4.  A crucial result by Ribet (formerly Serre's epsilon conjecture) on level-lowering shows that if $E$ is modular, the properties of the Frey curve imply that it must also correspond to a weight $2$ newform of level $N=2$.\n5.  This means that the existence of a counterexample to FLT implies the existence of a non-zero element in the space of weight $2$ cusp forms $S_2(\\Gamma_0(2))$.\n6.  However, our calculation has shown that $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(2)) = g(X_0(2)) = 0$. This space is trivial and contains only the zero form.\n7.  This is a contradiction. The existence of a solution to FLT implies the existence of a mathematical object in a space that is empty. Therefore, the initial assumption must be false, and no such solution exists.\nThe fact that $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(N)) = 0$ for $N=1, 3, 4$ as well, shows a general scarcity of cusp forms at low levels, a phenomenon that makes level-lowering theorems particularly powerful tools in number theory.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3083704"}]}
