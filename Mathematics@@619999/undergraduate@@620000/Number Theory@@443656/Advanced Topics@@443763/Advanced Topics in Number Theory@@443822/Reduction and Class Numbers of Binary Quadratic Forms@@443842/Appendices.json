For the given form, $Q(x,y)=2x^2+3xy+5y^2$, we have $a=2$, $b=3$, and $c=5$.\n\n**Derivation of the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant, $D$, of a binary quadratic form arises fundamentally from the process of completing the square. We manipulate the expression for $Q(x,y)$ to isolate a squared term involving both $x$ and $y$. We proceed by treating the form as a quadratic in $x$:\n$$Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$$\nWe multiply by $4a$ to avoid fractions in the intermediate steps of completing the square for the term $(2ax)^2$:\n$$4aQ(x,y) = 4a(ax^2 + bxy + cy^2) = 4a^2x^2 + 4abxy + 4acy^2$$\nThe first two terms are part of the expansion of $(2ax+by)^2$:\n$$(2ax+by)^2 = 4a^2x^2 + 4abxy + b^2y^2$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $4aQ(x,y)$:\n$$4aQ(x,y) = (2ax+by)^2 - b^2y^2 + 4acy^2$$\n$$4aQ(x,y) = (2ax+by)^2 - (b^2 - 4ac)y^2$$\nThe quantity $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is defined as the discriminant of the quadratic form. This expression shows that the nature of the values taken by $Q(x,y)$ is critically dependent on the sign of $D$.\n\nFor the specific form $Q(x,y)=2x^2+3xy+5y^2$, the coefficients are $a=2$, $b=3$, and $c=5$. Using the definition derived above, the discriminant is:\n$$D = b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4(2)(5) = 9 - 40 = -31$$\n\n**Determination of Definiteness**\n\nThe definiteness of a quadratic form can be determined using the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives, which for a binary quadratic form $Q(x,y)$ corresponds to a symmetric matrix representation. A quadratic form $Q(x,y)$ can be written in matrix notation as $\\mathbf{v}^T M \\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$ and $M$ is the symmetric matrix:\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b/2 \\\\ b/2  c \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor $Q(x,y)=2x^2+3xy+5y^2$, the associated matrix is:\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  3/2 \\\\ 3/2  5 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nAccording to Sylvester's criterion, a symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if all its leading principal minors are positive. The leading principal minors are the determinants of the top-left $k \\times k$ submatrices.\nThe first leading principal minor is $M_1 = \\det([2]) = 2$.\nThe second leading principal minor is $M_2 = \\det(M) = (2)(5) - (\\frac{3}{2})(\\frac{3}{2}) = 10 - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{40-9}{4} = \\frac{31}{4}$.\n\nSince $M_1=2  0$ and $M_2=\\frac{31}{4}  0$, both leading principal minors are positive. Therefore, the matrix $M$ is positive definite, and consequently, the quadratic form $Q(x,y)$ is positive definite. This means $Q(x,y)  0$ for all integers $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$.\n\nThe connection to the discriminant $D$ is direct. The second principal minor is the determinant of $M$:\n$$\\det(M) = ac - \\frac{b^2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}(b^2 - 4ac) = -\\frac{D}{4}$$\nThe criterion for positive definiteness ($M_1  0$ and $M_2  0$) translates to $a  0$ and $-D/4  0$. The condition $-D/4  0$ is equivalent to $D  0$.\nIn our case, $a=2  0$ and the calculated discriminant is $D=-31  0$. Both conditions are satisfied, confirming from the sign of $D$ and the first coefficient $a$ (which is the first principal minor) that the form is positive definite.\n\n**Explanation of the Role of $D$ and Class Number Finiteness**\n\nThe sign of the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ determines the qualitative behavior of the values $Q(x,y)$ represents. As shown in the derivation of $D$:\n$$Q(x,y) = \\frac{1}{4a} \\left( (2ax+by)^2 - Dy^2 \\right)$$\n- If $D  0$, then $-D  0$. The expression $(2ax+by)^2 - Dy^2$ is a sum of two squares (multiplied by a constant if we consider rational variables), which can only be zero if $y=0$ and $2ax+by=0$, implying $x=0$. Thus, $Q(x,y)$ has the same sign as $a$ for all $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$. The form is definite (positive definite if $a0$, negative definite if $a0$).\n- If $D  0$, the expression $(2ax+by)^2 - Dy^2$ is a difference of two squares. By choosing appropriate integer values for $x$ and $y$, it is possible to make this expression either positive or negative. Thus, the form is indefinite, representing both positive and negative values.\n- If $D = 0$, the form becomes $Q(x,y) = \\frac{1}{4a}(2ax+by)^2$, which is zero whenever $2ax+by=0$. This line of zeros indicates the form is degenerate.\n\nFor the case $D  0$, such as our discriminant $D=-31$, the forms are definite. The theory of binary quadratic forms studies equivalence classes of forms under the action of the modular group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Two forms are equivalent if they represent the same set of integers. Reduction theory provides a canonical representative for each equivalence class. For a positive definite form $ax^2+bxy+cy^2$, the conditions for it to be *reduced* are $|b| \\le a \\le c$.\n\nThe finiteness of the number of equivalence classes (the class number, $h(D)$) for a fixed negative discriminant $D$ can be deduced from these reduction conditions.\nFor a reduced form, we have the inequalities $|b| \\le a$ and $a \\le c$.\nFrom the discriminant equation, $D = b^2 - 4ac$, we have $4ac = b^2 - D$. Since the form is positive definite, $a  0$ and $c  0$.\nCombining the inequalities:\n$$4a^2 = 4a \\cdot a \\le 4a \\cdot c = 4ac = b^2 - D$$\nSince $|b| \\le a$, we have $b^2 \\le a^2$. Therefore:\n$$4a^2 \\le b^2 - D \\le a^2 - D$$\nThis implies $3a^2 \\le -D$. Since $D  0$, $-D$ is positive, and we can write this as:\n$$a^2 \\le \\frac{-D}{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{-D}{3}}$$\nSince $a$ must be an integer, this inequality shows that for a fixed discriminant $D$, there are only a finite number of possible values for the coefficient $a$.\nFor each of these finitely many values of $a$, the reduction condition $|b| \\le a$ implies there are only a finite number of possible integer values for $b$.\nFinally, for each pair $(a, b)$, the coefficient $c$ is uniquely determined by the discriminant equation: $c = \\frac{b^2-D}{4a}$. We must also verify that $c$ is an integer satisfying $a \\le c$, but the crucial point is that the number of possible triples $(a,b,c)$ for reduced forms is bounded.\nSince there are finitely many choices for $a$, and for each of these, finitely many choices for $b$, and $c$ is then fixed, the total number of reduced forms of discriminant $D$ must be finite. This finite number is the class number $h(D)$.\n\nIn summary, the negative sign of the discriminant ensures definiteness, which in turn leads to inequalities ($3a^2 \\le -D$ and $|b| \\le a$) that bound the coefficients of any reduced form, thereby proving the finiteness of the class number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-31}$$", "id": "3009986"}, {"introduction": "With the theoretical groundwork in place, we now turn to the central computational task: determining the class number for a given discriminant.

The solution process may proceed.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the number of primitive, positive definite reduced binary quadratic forms of discriminant $D = -23$. This number is the class number, denoted $h(D)$. A form is represented by the triple of its coefficients $(a,b,c)$.\n\nFirst, we derive a bound on the coefficient $a$. The form is positive definite, so $a  0$ and the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is negative. The reduction conditions are $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$.\n\nFrom the discriminant equation, we have $4ac = b^2 - D$. Since $D  0$, we can write $4ac = b^2 + |D|$.\nUsing the reduction inequalities:\n$a \\leq c \\implies 4a^2 \\leq 4ac$.\n$|b| \\leq a \\implies b^2 \\leq a^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the discriminant relation:\n$$4a^2 \\leq 4ac = b^2 + |D| \\leq a^2 + |D|$$\nThis gives the inequality $4a^2 \\leq a^2 + |D|$, which simplifies to $3a^2 \\leq |D|$.\nRearranging for $a$, we get:\n$$a^2 \\leq \\frac{|D|}{3} \\implies a \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{|D|}{3}}$$\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, this inequality provides a finite set of possible values for $a$.\n\nFor the specific case $D = -23$, we have $|D| = 23$. The bound on $a$ is:\n$$a \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{23}{3}} \\approx \\sqrt{7.666...} \\approx 2.768...$$\nTherefore, the only possible integer values for $a$ are $a=1$ and $a=2$.\n\nWe now systematically enumerate all possible triples $(a,b,c)$ for each value of $a$.\n\nAn additional constraint arises from the discriminant equation: $b^2 = 4ac + D$. For $D=-23$, we have $b^2 = 4ac - 23$. This implies $b^2 \\equiv -23 \\pmod 4$. Since $-23 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we must have $b^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.

This boundary condition is what ensures uniqueness. By dropping it, we anticipate that non-unique, equivalent representatives will appear on these boundaries.\n\nLet's investigate the case where $a=c$. Consider the form $f_1 = [2, 1, 2]$.\n- It is a primitive form, as $\\mathrm{gcd}(2, 1, 2) = 1$.\n- The discriminant is $\\Delta = 1^2 - 4(2)(2) = 1 - 16 = -15$.\n- It is positive definite since $\\Delta  0$ and $a=2  0$.\n- It satisfies the weakened reduction conditions: $|b| = 1 \\leq a = 2$ and $a = 2 \\leq c = 2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of the matrix $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The corresponding transformation is $(x, y) \\to (-y, x)$. Applying this to $f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ yields $f(-y, x) = a(-y)^2 + b(-y)x + c(x)^2 = cx^2 - bxy + ay^2$. This transformation maps the form $[a, b, c]$ to $[c, -b, a]$.\n\nApplying this transformation to $f_1 = [2, 1, 2]$, we obtain the form $f_2 = [2, -1, 2]$.\nLet's check if $f_2$ is also weakened-reduced:\n- It has the same discriminant $\\Delta = (-1)^2 - 4(2)(2) = -15$ and is also primitive.\n- It is positive definite as $a=2  0$.\n- It satisfies the weakened reduction conditions: $|b| = |-1| = 1 \\leq a = 2$ and $a = 2 \\leq c = 2$.\n\nWe have found two distinct forms, $f_1 = [2, 1, 2]$ and $f_2 = [2, -1, 2]$, which are properly equivalent yet both satisfy the weakened reduction conditions.

A key part of the proof establishes that $a=a'$, $c=c'$, and thus $b^2 = (b')^2$, leaving the ambiguity $b' = \\pm b$. The boundary conditions are designed precisely to resolve this ambiguity. By dropping them, we allow for cases where distinct, equivalent forms can coexist as \"reduced\".\n\nThe two primary sources of non-uniqueness arise from the action of specific elements of $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on the boundaries of the fundamental region defined by $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$.\n\n1.  **Boundary $a=c$**: As shown in our counterexample, the transformation $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ maps $[a, b, a]$ to $[a, -b, a]$. If a form $f_1 = [a, b, a]$ with $b \\neq 0$ is weakened-reduced (requiring $|b| \\leq a$), then the equivalent form $f_2 = [a, -b, a]$ is also weakened-reduced. If $b \\ne 0$, these two forms are distinct. The weakened reduction fails to choose between them. The standard condition $b \\geq 0$ would select $[a, |b|, a]$ as the unique representative.\n\n2.  **Boundary $|b|=a$**: Consider the transformation $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. It maps $(x, y) \\to (x+y, y)$, transforming $[a, b, c]$ to $[a, b+2a, a+b+c]$. Its inverse, $T^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, maps $[a, b, c]$ to $[a, b-2a, a-b+c]$. Consider a form $f_1 = [a, a, c]$ with $a \\leq c$. It is weakened-reduced. Let's find an equivalent form. The form $f_2 = [a, -a, c]$ is also weakened-reduced if $a \\leq c$. Applying the transformation $T$ to $f_2$ yields $[a, -a+2a, a-a+c] = [a, a, c] = f_1$. Thus, $[a, a, c]$ and $[a, -a, c]$ are properly equivalent. If $a0$, they are distinct. Both are weakened-reduced if $a \\leq c$. Again, uniqueness fails. The standard condition $b \\geq 0$ would select $[a, a, c]$.\n\nThe precise flaw is that the weakened reduction conditions define a fundamental domain whose boundaries are identified with each other under the group action. By not imposing a tie-breaking rule (like $b \\geq 0$) on these boundaries, points that are equivalent under the group action are both included, breaking uniqueness. The specific failure occurs for forms satisfying either $a=c$ (with $b \\neq 0$) or $|b|=a$.\n\n### Part 3: Calculation for Discriminant $\\Delta = -3$\nWe seek the number of primitive positive definite forms $[a, b, c]$ with $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = -3$ that satisfy the weakened reduction conditions $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$.\n\nThe condition $\\Delta = -3$ implies $4ac = b^2 + 3$.\nFrom the reduction condition $|b| \\leq a$, we have $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nSubstituting this into the discriminant equation:\n$4ac = b^2 + 3 \\leq a^2 + 3$.\n\nFrom the reduction condition $a \\leq c$, we can write $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$.\nCombining these inequalities, we get:\n$4a^2 \\leq 4ac \\leq a^2 + 3$\nThis simplifies to $3a^2 \\leq 3$, which means $a^2 \\leq 1$.\nSince the form is positive definite, $a$ must be a positive integer, so the only possibility is $a=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute $a=1$ back into our conditions:\n$1.$ $|b| \\leq a \\implies |b| \\leq 1$. Since $b$ must be an integer, $b \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n$2.$ $4ac = b^2 + 3 \\implies 4(1)c = b^2 + 3 \\implies 4c = b^2 + 3$.\n\nWe test the possible integer values for $b$:\n- If $b=0$, then $4c = 0^2 + 3 = 3$, which gives $c = 3/4$. This is not an integer, so no form exists for $b=0$.\n- If $b=1$, then $4c = 1^2 + 3 = 4$, which gives $c=1$. This yields the form $f_1 = [1, 1, 1]$.\n- If $b=-1$, then $4c = (-1)^2 + 3 = 4$, which gives $c=1$. This yields the form $f_2 = [1, -1, 1]$.\n\nWe must verify that these two forms satisfy all the required properties.\nFor $f_1 = [1, 1, 1]$:\n- $\\Delta = 1^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3$.\n- Primitive: $\\mathrm{gcd}(1, 1, 1) = 1$.\n- Positive definite: $a=1  0$.\n- Weakened-reduced: $|b|=1 \\leq a=1$ and $a=1 \\leq c=1$. The conditions are met.\n\nFor $f_2 = [1, -1, 1]$:\n- $\\Delta = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3$.\n- Primitive: $\\mathrm{gcd}(1, -1, 1) = 1$.\n- Positive definite: $a=1  0$.\n- Weakened-reduced: $|b|=|-1|=1 \\leq a=1$ and $a=1 \\leq c=1$. The conditions are met.\n\nWe have found two distinct forms, $[1, 1, 1]$ and $[1, -1, 1]$, that are weakened-reduced. The problem asks for the number of such representatives within a single proper equivalence class. We must check if these two forms are properly equivalent.\nAs shown in Part 1, the transformation $S$ maps $[a,b,c]$ to $[c,-b,a]$. Applying this to $f_1 = [1, 1, 1]$ gives $[1, -1, 1]$, which is $f_2$. Thus, they are properly equivalent.\n\nThe class number for discriminant $\\Delta = -3$, denoted $h(-3)$, is known to be $1$. This means all primitive positive definite forms of this discriminant belong to a single proper equivalence class. Since we have exhausted all possibilities for weakened-reduced forms with $\\Delta = -3$ and found exactly two, both of which are equivalent, these two forms are the complete set of weakened-reduced representatives for the unique equivalence class.\n\nTherefore, the number of weakened-reduced representatives in the proper equivalence class of primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $\\Delta = -3$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3089496"}]}
