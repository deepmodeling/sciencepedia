For a fixed prime $p$, the $p$-adic valuation $v_{p}:\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ is defined by the rule that for $x\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ one writes $x=p^{k}\\frac{a}{b}$ with integers $a,b$ not divisible by $p$ and $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, and sets $v_{p}(x)=k$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is well-defined, scientifically grounded in standard number theory, and self-contained.\n\nThe task is to compute the explicit value of $|42/35|_{5}$. The prime under consideration is $p=5$. Let the rational number be denoted by $x = \\frac{42}{35}$.\n\nThe computation proceeds in two stages, following the definitions provided in the problem statement. First, we determine the $5$-adic valuation, $v_{5}(x)$, and second, we use this to compute the $5$-adic absolute value, $|x|_{5}$.\n\nStep 1: Compute the $5$-adic valuation $v_{5}(\\frac{42}{35})$.\nThe definition of the $p$-adic valuation, $v_{p}(x)$, for a non-zero rational number $x$, requires us to write $x$ in the form $x=p^{k}\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers not divisible by $p$, and $k$ is an integer. The valuation is then given by $v_{p}(x)=k$.\n\nIn our case, $x = \\frac{42}{35}$ and $p=5$.\nFirst, we simplify the fraction:\n$$x = \\frac{42}{35} = \\frac{6 \\times 7}{5 \\times 7} = \\frac{6}{5}$$\nNow, we must express this number in the canonical form $5^{k}\\frac{a}{b}$. We can write:\n$$x = \\frac{6}{5} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 6 \\times 5^{-1}$$\nTo match the form $5^{k}\\frac{a}{b}$, we can write this as:\n$$x = 5^{-1} \\times \\frac{6}{1}$$\nWe identify the components from this expression:\n$k = -1$\n$a = 6$\n$b = 1$\n\nWe must verify that integers $a$ and $b$ are not divisible by the prime $p=5$.\nThe integer $a=6$ is not divisible by $5$, since $6 = 1 \\times 5 + 1$.\nThe integer $b=1$ is not divisible by $5$.\nThe conditions of the definition are met. Therefore, the $5$-adic valuation of $x = \\frac{42}{35}$ is:\n$$v_{5}\\left(\\frac{42}{35}\\right) = k = -1$$\n\nStep 2: Compute the $5$-adic absolute value $|\\frac{42}{35}|_{5}$.\nThe definition of the $p$-adic absolute value is given by $|x|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(x)}$.\nSubstituting $p=5$ and the value of the valuation we found, $v_{5}(\\frac{42}{35}) = -1$:\n$$\\left|\\frac{42}{35}\\right|_{5} = 5^{-v_{5}\\left(\\frac{42}{35}\\right)} = 5^{-(-1)}$$\n$$ = 5^{1} = 5$$\nThus, the explicit value of $|42/35|_{5}$ is $5$.\n\nAlternatively, one may use the properties of the valuation $v_p(yz) = v_p(y) + v_p(z)$ and $v_p(y/z) = v_p(y) - v_p(z)$. To compute $v_5(42/35)$, we find $v_5(42)$ and $v_5(35)$ from their prime factorizations.\nThe prime factorization of $42$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 7$. Since $5$ is not a prime factor of $42$, we can write $42 = 5^0 \\times 42$. Thus, $v_5(42) = 0$.\nThe prime factorization of $35$ is $5 \\times 7 = 5^1 \\times 7$. Thus, $v_5(35) = 1$.\nUsing the property of the valuation of a quotient:\n$$v_5\\left(\\frac{42}{35}\\right) = v_5(42) - v_5(35) = 0 - 1 = -1$$\nThis result is consistent with the one obtained by direct application of the definition.\nFinally, the absolute value is:\n$$\\left|\\frac{42}{35}\\right|_{5} = 5^{-v_5(42/35)} = 5^{-(-1)} = 5$$\nThe final answer is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3092010"}, {"introduction": "After defining the local fields $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, a crucial question is how to determine if an equation possesses a solution within them.

This is a contradiction to the definition of a primitive solution. Therefore, the equation $X^{2}-2Y^{2}-3Z^{2}=0$ has no non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    Since there is no local solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$, one of the conditions of the Hasse-Minkowski theorem is not satisfied. Therefore, there is no non-trivial rational solution to $X^{2}-2Y^{2}-3Z^{2}=0$, and consequently, no rational solution to $x^{2}-2y^{2}=3$.\n\n    For completeness, let's analyze solvability in $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}$ as requested.\n    We check for a non-trivial solution to $X^{2}-2Y^{2}-3Z^{2}=0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}$. Again, consider a primitive solution $(X,Y,Z) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{3}$. Considering the equation modulo $3$:\n    $X^{2}-2Y^{2}-3Z^{2} \\equiv X^{2}-2Y^{2} \\equiv X^{2}+Y^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n    The squares modulo $3$ are $0^{2}\\equiv 0$ and $(\\pm 1)^{2}\\equiv 1$. The sum of two squares is $0 \\pmod{3}$ only if both squares are $0 \\pmod{3}$. Thus, $X^{2}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and $Y^{2}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. This implies $X\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and $Y\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. So $v_{3}(X)\\ge 1$ and $v_{3}(Y)\\ge 1$.\n    Let $X=3X'$ and $Y=3Y'$. Substituting into the original equation:\n    $(3X')^{2}-2(3Y')^{2}-3Z^{2} = 0 \\implies 9(X')^{2}-18(Y')^{2}-3Z^{2}=0$.\n    Dividing by $3$, we get $3(X')^{2}-6(Y')^{2}-Z^{2}=0$.\n    Taking this equation modulo $3$: $-Z^{2}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which implies $Z\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $v_{3}(Z)\\ge 1$.\n    This shows that for any solution $(X,Y,Z)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{3}$, all three coordinates must be divisible by $3$. This contradicts the assumption of a primitive solution where at least one coordinate is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$. Hence, there is no non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}$.\n\n    The lack of solutions in $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$ (and also in $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}$) is a local obstruction. By the Hasse principle, this implies there are no rational solutions. Therefore, the indicator S must be 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, there is no rational solution to the given equation. So, the indicator $S$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3027936"}]}
