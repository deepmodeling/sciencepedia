It is well-posed, as the Gauss reduction algorithm is guaranteed to terminate and produce a well-defined reduced basis. The problem is stated objectively and contains all necessary information. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe represent the basis vectors as columns of a basis matrix $B$:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{b}_{1}  \\mathbf{b}_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5  1 \\\\ 2  3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe Gauss reduction algorithm for a $2$-dimensional basis $\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\mathbf{v}_{2}\\}$ consists of iterating two steps:\n1.  **Swap:** If $\\|\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\|  \\|\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\|$, swap $\\mathbf{v}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{2}$.\n2.  **Size-reduce:** Replace $\\mathbf{v}_{2}$ with $\\mathbf{v}_{2} - q \\mathbf{v}_{1}$, where $q = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{2}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\|^{2}} \\right\\rceil$ is the nearest integer to the projection coefficient. This step is repeated until $q=0$.\n\nThe algorithm terminates when $\\|\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\| \\le \\|\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\|$ and the size-reduction condition $|\\mathbf{v}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{2}| \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\|^{2}$ holds.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to our initial basis $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the squared norms:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\|^{2} = 5^{2} + 2^{2} = 25 + 4 = 29\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\|^{2} = 1^{2} + 3^{2} = 1 + 9 = 10\n$$\nSince $\\|\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\|^{2}  \\|\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\|^{2}$, we must swap the vectors. This is a unimodular transformation with determinant $-1$. The new basis, which we will call $\\{\\mathbf{b}'_{1}, \\mathbf{b}'_{2}\\}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}'_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}'_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we perform the size-reduction step. We need to reduce $\\mathbf{b}'_{2}$ with respect to $\\mathbf{b}'_{1}$. We compute the coefficient $q$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{b}'_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}'_{2}}{\\|\\mathbf{b}'_{1}\\|^{2}} = \\frac{(1)(5) + (3)(2)}{1^{2} + 3^{2}} = \\frac{5 + 6}{10} = \\frac{11}{10} = 1.1\n$$\nThe nearest integer is $q = \\lfloor 1.1 \\rceil = 1$.

Let's call these vectors $\\mathbf{c}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{c}_{2}$ for clarity.\n\nNow we check if this new basis is reduced.\n$$\n\\mathbf{c}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{c}_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, check the length condition:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{c}_{1}\\|^{2} = 1^{2} + 3^{2} = 10\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{c}_{2}\\|^{2} = 4^{2} + (-1)^{2} = 16 + 1 = 17\n$$\nThe condition $\\|\\mathbf{c}_{1}\\| \\le \\|\\mathbf{c}_{2}\\|$ (or $\\|\\mathbf{c}_{1}\\|^{2} \\le \\|\\mathbf{c}_{2}\\|^{2}$) is satisfied, since $10 \\le 17$. So, no swap is needed.\n\nNext, check the size-reduction condition: $|\\mathbf{c}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{c}_{2}| \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\mathbf{c}_{1}\\|^{2}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{c}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{c}_{2} = (1)(4) + (3)(-1) = 4 - 3 = 1\n$$\nThe condition is $|1| \\le \\frac{1}{2}(10)$, which is $1 \\le 5$. This is true. The basis is reduced.\nThe Gauss-reduced basis is $\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$.\n\nNext, we compute the determinant for the original and reduced bases. The determinant of a basis is the signed area of the fundamental parallelogram.\nFor the original basis matrix $B = \\begin{pmatrix} 5  1 \\\\ 2  3 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\n\\det(B) = (5)(3) - (1)(2) = 15 - 2 = 13\n$$\nFor the reduced basis matrix $B_{\\text{red}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  4 \\\\ 3  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\n\\det(B_{\\text{red}}) = (1)(-1) - (4)(3) = -1 - 12 = -13\n$$\n\nThe relationship between these values stems from the nature of unimodular transformations. Any change of basis for a lattice can be represented by right-multiplication by a unimodular matrix $U$ (an integer matrix with $\\det(U) = \\pm 1$). That is, $B_{\\text{new}} = B_{\\text{old}} U$.\nUsing the property of determinants, $\\det(B_{\\text{new}}) = \\det(B_{\\text{old}} U) = \\det(B_{\\text{old}}) \\det(U)$.\nSince $\\det(U) = \\pm 1$, it follows that $\\det(B_{\\text{new}}) = \\pm \\det(B_{\\text{old}})$.\nThis implies that the absolute value of the determinant, $|\\det(B)|$, is an invariant for a given lattice. This invariant is called the covolume of the lattice, denoted $\\text{covol}(L)$, and it represents the volume (in this case, area) of the fundamental domain.\n\nIn our case, $\\det(B_{\\text{red}}) = -13$ and $\\det(B) = 13$. We have $\\det(B_{\\text{red}}) = (-1) \\times \\det(B)$, which is consistent with the theory. The overall unimodular transformation matrix that transformed the original basis to the reduced one had a determinant of $-1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the common absolute value of these determinants, which is the covolume of $L$.\n$$\n\\text{covol}(L) = |\\det(B)| = |13| = 13\n$$\n$$\n\\text{covol}(L) = |\\det(B_{\\text{red}})| = |-13| = 13\n$$\nThe value is $13$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{13}\n$$", "id": "3091236"}, {"introduction": "When we apply an integer linear transformation to a lattice, does it change the lattice itself or simply describe it with a new basis?

The matrix $A$ is a valid integer matrix. The questions posed are precise and have a unique, determinable answer based on established mathematical theorems. There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, no ambiguity, and no missing information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by defining the necessary concepts from the geometry of numbers and applying them to the given problem.\n\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that spans the vector space. For this problem, the lattice is $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, the set of all vectors with integer coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. This is the standard integer lattice. The basis vectors for $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ are the standard basis vectors of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$: $\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{e}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\mathbf{e}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. These vectors can be viewed as the columns of the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix $I$.\n\nThe covolume of a lattice, denoted $\\text{vol}(\\Lambda)$, is the volume of its fundamental domain. A fundamental domain is a parallelepiped spanned by a set of basis vectors. For a lattice generated by the columns of a matrix $B$, the covolume is given by $\\text{vol}(\\Lambda) = |\\det(B)|$. For the standard lattice $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, the basis matrix is the identity matrix $I$, so its covolume is $\\text{vol}(\\mathbb{Z}^{3}) = |\\det(I)| = 1$.\n\nThe problem considers the set $A\\Lambda = A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, which is the image of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ under the linear transformation represented by the matrix $A$. Since $A$ is an invertible matrix with real entries, $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is also a lattice. A basis for this new lattice is given by the images of the basis vectors of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$: $\\{A\\mathbf{e}_1, A\\mathbf{e}_2, A\\mathbf{e}_3\\}$. These are precisely the columns of the matrix $A$. Therefore, the lattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is generated by the columns of $A$.\n\nThe covolume of the lattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix whose columns form its basis, which is $A$ itself.\nWe compute the determinant of $A$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}123\\\\014\\\\001\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $A$ is an upper triangular matrix, its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThe covolume of the transformed lattice is therefore $\\text{vol}(A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}) = |\\det(A)| = |1| = 1$.\n\nThe index of a sublattice $\\Lambda'$ within a lattice $\\Lambda$, denoted $[\\Lambda:\\Lambda']$, is the order of the quotient group $\\Lambda/\\Lambda'$. This index is finite if and only if $\\Lambda'$ has the same rank as $\\Lambda$. Since $A$ has integer entries, for any $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, the product $A\\mathbf{v}$ is also a vector with integer entries. This means $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. As $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, the lattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ has rank $3$, the same as $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. Therefore, $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is a sublattice of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nA fundamental result in the geometry of numbers states that if an integer matrix $A$ defines a sublattice $A\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ of $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, the index of this sublattice is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n$$\n[\\mathbb{Z}^{n} : A\\mathbb{Z}^{n}] = |\\det(A)|\n$$\nThis can be understood as the ratio of the covolumes of the lattices: $[\\Lambda : \\Lambda'] = \\frac{\\text{vol}(\\Lambda')}{\\text{vol}(\\Lambda)}$, where $\\Lambda'$ is a sublattice of $\\Lambda$. Applied to our problem:\n$$\n[\\mathbb{Z}^{3} : A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}] = \\frac{\\text{vol}(A\\mathbb{Z}^{3})}{\\text{vol}(\\mathbb{Z}^{3})} = \\frac{|\\det(A)|}{|\\det(I)|} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$$\nSo, the index $[\\Lambda:A\\Lambda]$ is $1$.\n\nNext, we infer whether $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. The index $[\\mathbb{Z}^{3} : A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}]$ represents the number of distinct cosets of $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. An index of $1$ means there is only one coset, which must be $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ itself. This implies that the quotient group $\\mathbb{Z}^{3} / A\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is the trivial group, which occurs if and only if the sublattice is identical to the original lattice. Therefore, $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nThis conclusion is further justified by the concept of unimodularity. An integer matrix $U \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is called unimodular if its determinant is either $1$ or $-1$. The inverse of such a matrix, given by $U^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(U)}\\text{adj}(U)$, also has integer entries, since the adjugate matrix $\\text{adj}(U)$ consists of cofactors which are integer polynomials of the entries of $U$.\nA linear transformation represented by an integer matrix $A$ maps $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ to itself, i.e., $A\\mathbb{Z}^{n} = \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, if and only if $A$ is unimodular.\nIn this problem, the matrix $A$ has all integer entries, and we calculated its determinant to be $\\det(A) = 1$. Thus, $A$ is a unimodular matrix. According to the theorem, the transformation defined by $A$ is an automorphism of the group $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, meaning it is a bijection from $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ to itself. Consequently, the image of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ under $A$ is $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ itself, confirming that $A\\mathbb{Z}^{3} = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the index $[\\Lambda:A\\Lambda]$. Based on our calculation, this value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3091243"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its basis, we can describe a lattice's geometric structure by how its points are distributed in space, especially in relation to a given shape like a disk or a square.

This is equivalent to finding the minimum norm of a non-zero vector in the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\nLet $v = (v_1, v_2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ with $v \\neq (0,0)$. The squared Euclidean norm is $\\|v\\|_{2}^{2} = v_1^{2} + v_2^{2}$. Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are integers and not both zero, the smallest possible non-zero value for the sum of squares $v_1^{2} + v_2^{2}$ is $1^{2} + 0^{2} = 1$. This minimum is achieved by the four vectors $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$.\nThe minimum norm is thus $\\min_{v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2} \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\nTherefore, the first successive minimum is $\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda) = 1$.\n\nSecond, we compute $\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*})$.\nThis requires us to first identify the polar body $K^{\\circ}$ and the dual lattice $\\Lambda^{*}$.\nThe polar body is defined as $K^{\\circ} = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\langle x, y \\rangle \\leq 1 \\text{ for all } x \\in K \\}$.\nGiven $K = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\|x\\|_{2} \\leq 1 \\}$, the condition is $\\langle x, y \\rangle \\leq 1$ for all $x$ with $\\|x\\|_{2} \\leq 1$.\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|\\langle x, y \\rangle| \\leq \\|x\\|_{2} \\|y\\|_{2}$. For any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, to maximize $\\langle x, y \\rangle$ over $x \\in K$, we choose $x$ to be the unit vector in the direction of $y$, i.e., $x = y/\\|y\\|_{2}$ (if $y \\neq 0$). For this $x$, $\\|x\\|_{2}=1$ and $\\langle x, y \\rangle = \\langle y/\\|y\\|_{2}, y \\rangle = \\|y\\|_{2}$.\nThe condition $\\langle x, y \\rangle \\leq 1$ for all $x \\in K$ thus implies that the maximum value, $\\|y\\|_{2}$, must be less than or equal to $1$. Hence, $\\|y\\|_{2} \\leq 1$.\nConversely, if $\\|y\\|_{2} \\leq 1$, then for any $x \\in K$ (so $\\|x\\|_{2} \\leq 1$), we have $\\langle x, y \\rangle \\leq \\|x\\|_{2} \\|y\\|_{2} \\leq 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThus, $K^{\\circ} = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\|y\\|_{2} \\leq 1 \\}$. This means the polar body of the unit disk is the unit disk itself: $K^{\\circ} = K$.\n\nThe dual lattice is defined as $\\Lambda^{*} = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\langle y, x \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ for all } x \\in \\Lambda \\}$.\nGiven $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, let $y = (y_1, y_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The condition must hold for all $x = (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\nChoosing $x = (1, 0)$, we get $\\langle y, (1,0) \\rangle = y_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nChoosing $x = (0, 1)$, we get $\\langle y, (0,1) \\rangle = y_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, both components of $y$ must be integers, which means $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\nConversely, if $y=(y_1, y_2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $x=(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$, their inner product $\\langle y, x \\rangle = y_1x_1 + y_2x_2$ is a sum of products of integers, and is therefore an integer.\nThus, the dual lattice of the integer lattice is the integer lattice itself: $\\Lambda^{*} = \\mathbb{Z}^{2} = \\Lambda$.\n\nNow we can compute $\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*}) = \\lambda_{2}(K, \\Lambda)$.\nThe definition is $\\lambda_{2}(K,\\Lambda) = \\inf \\{ \\lambda  0 : \\lambda K \\text{ contains } 2 \\text{ linearly independent points of } \\Lambda \\}$.\nWe are looking for the smallest $\\lambda  0$ such that the disk of radius $\\lambda$ contains two linearly independent vectors from $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\nFrom the properties of successive minima, we know $\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda) \\leq \\lambda_{2}(K,\\Lambda)$. Since we found $\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda) = 1$, it must be that $\\lambda_{2}(K,\\Lambda) \\geq 1$.\nLet's consider the case $\\lambda = 1$. The disk $1 \\cdot K = K$ is the closed unit disk. The points of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ in this disk are those $v=(v_1, v_2)$ with $v_1^2+v_2^2 \\le 1^2=1$. The integer solutions are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,-1)$.\nWe need to find two linearly independent vectors from this set. Let's choose $v_1 = (1,0)$ and $v_2 = (0,1)$. Both are in $K$. To check for linear independence, we can form a matrix and compute its determinant:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\neq 0 $$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent.\nSo, for $\\lambda = 1$, the set $\\lambda K$ contains at least two linearly independent points of $\\Lambda$. This implies that $\\lambda_{2}(K, \\Lambda) \\leq 1$.\nCombining the inequalities $\\lambda_{2}(K,\\Lambda) \\geq 1$ and $\\lambda_{2}(K,\\Lambda) \\leq 1$, we conclude that $\\lambda_{2}(K,\\Lambda) = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*}) = 1$.\n\nThird, we compute the product $\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda)\\,\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*})$.\nUsing the values computed above:\n$$ \\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda)\\,\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 $$\n\nFinally, we assess this result in the context of the classical transference principle. The principle, in one of its forms, provides bounds relating the successive minima of a convex body $K$ with respect to a lattice $\\Lambda$ and those of its polar body $K^{\\circ}$ with respect to the dual lattice $\\Lambda^{*}$. For an $n$-dimensional space, the bounds are:\n$$ 1 \\leq \\lambda_{i}(K,\\Lambda)\\,\\lambda_{n-i+1}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*}) \\leq C_n $$\nfor $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$, where $C_n$ is a constant depending only on the dimension $n$.\nIn our case, the dimension is $n=2$ and we have computed the product for $i=1$: $\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda)\\,\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*})$. The second index is $n-i+1 = 2-1+1 = 2$, which matches the problem's quantities.\nOur computed product is $1$. The inequality becomes $1 \\leq 1 \\leq C_2$. This is perfectly consistent with the transference principle, and shows that the lower bound is sharp and can be attained.\n\nThe three requested values are:\n$\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda) = 1$\n$\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*}) = 1$\n$\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda)\\,\\lambda_{2}(K^{\\circ},\\Lambda^{*}) = 1$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3091252"}]}
