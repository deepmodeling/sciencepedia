All definitions provided are standard in the theory of $p$-adic numbers. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It poses a standard, non-trivial question that illustrates a fundamental difference between the real and $p$-adic topologies. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two distinct analyses of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ defined by $a_n := p^n$, where $p$ is a fixed prime number.\n\nFirst, we establish that the sequence is unbounded with respect to the usual absolute value $|\\cdot|$ on the field of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe sequence of real numbers is given by $a_n = p^n$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we have $p \\geq 2$. The usual absolute value of $a_n$ is $|a_n| = |p^n| = p^n$, since $p^n$ is always positive. To show that the sequence $\\{p^n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ is unbounded, we must show that for any positive real number $M$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n  N$, it holds that $a_n  M$.\n\nLet an arbitrary $M  0$ be given. We want to find an integer $n$ such that $p^n  M$. Since $p \\geq 2$, the logarithm function with base $p$, $\\log_p(x)$, is a strictly increasing function for $x0$. Applying this function to both sides of the inequality $p^n  M$ (assuming $M1$ for simplicity, the case $0M \\le 1$ is trivial as $p^n \\ge 2$ for $n \\ge 1$) preserves the inequality:\n$$ \\log_p(p^n)  \\log_p(M) $$\n$$ n  \\log_p(M) $$\nBy the Archimedean property of the real numbers, there exists a natural number $N$ such that $N  \\log_p(M)$. For any integer $n  N$, it follows that $n  N  \\log_p(M)$. Since the function $f(x)=p^x$ is also strictly increasing, this implies $p^n  p^{\\log_p(M)} = M$.\nTherefore, for any choice of $M  0$, we can find an $N$ (for instance, $N = \\max(1, \\lfloor \\log_p(M) \\rfloor)$) such that for all $n  N$, $a_n  M$. This confirms that the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is unbounded in the usual absolute value.\n\nSecond, we determine the limit of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ in the field of $p$-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, with respect to the $p$-adic metric $d_p(x,y) = |x-y|_p$. We are looking for a value $L \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$ such that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = L$. This is equivalent to showing that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n - L|_p = 0$.\n\nLet us propose that the limit is $L=0$. We must verify if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n - 0|_p = 0$.\nThe term to evaluate is $|a_n|_p = |p^n|_p$.\nAccording to the problem's definition, for any nonzero rational number $x = p^k \\frac{a}{b}$ where $p \\nmid a$ and $p \\nmid b$, the $p$-adic valuation is $v_p(x) = k$.\nFor our sequence term $a_n = p^n$, we can write it in the required form as $p^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{1}$. Here, the exponent of $p$ is $k=n$, and we have $a=1$ and $b=1$. Since $p$ is a prime number, $p$ does not divide $1$. Thus, the conditions on $a$ and $b$ are satisfied.\nThe $p$-adic valuation of $a_n$ is therefore $v_p(a_n) = v_p(p^n) = n$.\n\nThe $p$-adic absolute value is defined as $|x|_p = p^{-v_p(x)}$. Applying this definition to $a_n$:\n$$ |a_n|_p = |p^n|_p = p^{-v_p(p^n)} = p^{-n} $$\nNow we need to determine if the sequence of real numbers $\\{|a_n|_p\\}_{n \\geq 1} = \\{p^{-n}\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ converges to $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. This is a standard limit of a real-valued sequence.\n\nTo prove this formally using the provided definition of convergence, let an arbitrary $\\epsilon  0$ be given. We need to find a natural number $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all integers $n \\geq N$, we have $|a_n - 0|_p  \\epsilon$.\nSubstituting the expression for $|a_n|_p$, the condition is:\n$$ p^{-n}  \\epsilon $$\nWe can analyze this inequality in two cases based on the value of $\\epsilon$.\n\nCase 1: $\\epsilon \\geq 1$.\nSince $p$ is a prime, $p \\geq 2$. For any $n \\geq 1$, we have $p^n \\geq 2$, which implies $p^{-n} = \\frac{1}{p^n} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, for any $n \\geq 1$, we have $p^{-n} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}  1 \\leq \\epsilon$. In this case, the inequality $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$ holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We can simply choose $N=1$.\n\nCase 2: $0  \\epsilon  1$.\nThe inequality $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{p^n}  \\epsilon$, which is equivalent to $p^n  \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$. Since $0  \\epsilon  1$, we have $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}  1$. As the logarithm function with base $p$ is a strictly increasing function, we can take the logarithm of both sides without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\log_p(p^n)  \\log_p\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\n$$ n  \\log_p\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nWe can choose $N$ to be any integer satisfying this condition for all subsequent $n$. A valid choice is $N = \\lfloor\\log_p(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})\\rfloor + 1$. Since $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}  1$, $\\log_p(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})  0$, which ensures that $N$ is a positive integer. For any $n \\geq N$, we have $n  \\log_p(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, which implies $p^n  \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, and thus $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$.\n\nIn both cases, for any given $\\epsilon  0$, we have found an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $|a_n - 0|_p  \\epsilon$. This satisfies the definition of convergence. Therefore, the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ converges to $0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0 \\quad (\\text{in } \\mathbb{Q}_p) $$\nThis result highlights a striking contrast: the sequence of powers of $p$, which grows without bound in the real metric, converges to $0$ in the $p$-adic metric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3086406"}, {"introduction": "Having recalibrated our sense of distance, we can now ask: what does a $p$-adic number actually look like?

The denominator $13$ is not divisible by $5$, so $|x|_5 = \\left|\\dfrac{7}{13}\\right|_5 = \\dfrac{|7|_5}{|13|_5} = \\dfrac{5^{-0}}{5^{-0}}=1$.

Let $x_0 = x$. For each $n \\geq 0$, we find the unique digit $d_n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $x_n \\equiv d_n \\pmod 5$. Then, we define the next remainder as $x_{n+1} = \\dfrac{x_n - d_n}{5}$.\n\nFor $n=0$:\nWe have $x_0 = \\dfrac{7}{13}$. To find $d_0$, we compute $x_0 \\pmod 5$. This requires finding the inverse of $13$ modulo $5$.\n$13 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5$. The inverse of $3$ modulo $5$ is $2$, since $3 \\times 2 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.\nThus, $d_0 \\equiv \\dfrac{7}{13} \\equiv 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$. So, $d_0=4$.\nThe next remainder is $x_1 = \\dfrac{\\frac{7}{13} - 4}{5} = \\dfrac{7-52}{13 \\times 5} = \\dfrac{-45}{65} = -\\dfrac{9}{13}$.\n\nFor $n=1$:\nWe have $x_1 = -\\dfrac{9}{13}$.\n$d_1 \\equiv -\\dfrac{9}{13} \\pmod 5$. Since $-9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$ and $13^{-1} \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$, we have $d_1 \\equiv 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\pmod 5$.

We observe that $x_5 = x_1$.\nSince the remainder $x_5$ is equal to the earlier remainder $x_1$, the sequence of remainders $(x_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ will be periodic. This implies that the sequence of digits $(d_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ will also be periodic.\nThe sequence of digits starts with $d_0=4$. The subsequent digits are derived from the sequence of remainders starting with $x_1$. The remainders repeat with the block $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$. The corresponding block of digits is $(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4) = (2, 1, 2, 3)$.\nThe first six digits are $d_0=4$, $d_1=2$, $d_2=1$, $d_3=2$, $d_4=3$, $d_5=d_1=2$.\nThe $5$-adic expansion of $\\dfrac{7}{13}$ is $4.21232123\\dots_5$, which is written as $4.\\overline{2123}_5$.\nThe length of the repeating block $(2, 1, 2, 3)$ is $4$. Since the remainders $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are distinct ($-\\frac{9}{13}, -\\frac{7}{13}, -\\frac{4}{13}, -\\frac{6}{13}$), the period cannot be shorter.\nTherefore, the minimal period length is $t=4$.\n\nPart (b): Proof of eventual periodicity.\n\nLet $r = \\dfrac{a}{b}$ be a rational number in lowest terms, where $p$ is a prime and $\\gcd(b, p)=1$.\nAny rational number $r$ can be written as $r=p^k r'$ for some integer $k$ and a rational number $r'$ with $|r'|_p=1$. The $p$-adic expansion of $r$ is just a shift of the expansion of $r'$, so if the expansion of $r'$ is eventually periodic, so is that of $r$. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume $|r|_p=1$, which implies $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $r$ can be written as $r=\\frac{a}{b}$ with $p \\nmid a$ and $p \\nmid b$.\n\nLet $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since $\\gcd(b,p)=1$, $p$ is a unit in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/b\\mathbb{Z}$. By Euler's totient theorem, $p^{\\phi(b)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod b$. Let $t$ be the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $b$. Then $t$ divides $\\phi(b)$, and $p^t \\equiv 1 \\pmod b$. This means $p^t - 1 = kb$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow consider the product $(p^t-1)r$:\n$$ (p^t-1)r = (p^t-1)\\frac{a}{b} = (kb)\\frac{a}{b} = ka $$\nThe product $ka$ is an integer. This gives a fundamental relation:\n$$ p^t r - r = ka $$\nLet the $p$-adic expansion of $r$ be $r = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} d_n p^n$. Then the expansion of $p^t r$ is:\n$$ p^t r = p^t \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} d_n p^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} d_n p^{n+t} = \\sum_{j=t}^{\\infty} d_{j-t} p^j $$\nThe integer $ka$ has a finite $p$-adic expansion, as any integer does. Let $ka = \\sum_{n=0}^{M} c_n p^n$ for some integer $M$.\nThe equation $r+ka=p^t r$ can be analyzed at the level of digits. Let $r+ka = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty e_n p^n$. The digits $e_n$ are the digits of the expansion of $p^t r$, so $e_n = 0$ for $n  t$ and $e_n = d_{n-t}$ for $n \\ge t$.\n\nThe digits of a sum are found by recursive formulae involving carries. Let $(\\epsilon_n)_{n \\geq 0}$ be the sequence of carries, where $\\epsilon_{-1}=0$.\n$$ d_n + c_n + \\epsilon_{n-1} = e_n + p \\epsilon_n, \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 0 $$\nSince the expansion of $ka$ is finite, $c_n=0$ for all $n  M$.\nFor $n  M$, the relation becomes $d_n + \\epsilon_{n-1} = e_n + p\\epsilon_n$.\nFurthermore, for $n \\ge t$, we have $e_n = d_{n-t}$.\nSo, for $n  \\max(M, t-1)$, we have:\n$$ d_n + \\epsilon_{n-1} = d_{n-t} + p\\epsilon_n $$\nThe carries $\\epsilon_n$ must be integers. From the addition algorithm, $d_n+c_n+\\epsilon_{n-1} \\le (p-1)+(p-1)+1=2p-1$ (a loose bound, but sufficient), so $\\epsilon_n$ is bounded. In fact $\\epsilon_n$ is either $0$ or $1$ for $nM$.\nLet's analyze the sequence of carries for $n  M$.\nIf $\\epsilon_{n-1}=0$, then $d_n = d_{n-t} + p\\epsilon_n$. Since $d_n, d_{n-t} \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$, this equation can only hold if $\\epsilon_n=0$, which implies $d_n=d_{n-t}$. Thus, if a carry $\\epsilon_{n-1}$ is $0$ for $n-1  M$, all subsequent carries $\\epsilon_{k}$ for $k \\ge n-1$ are $0$.\nThe only way for carries to persist is if $\\epsilon_{n-1}=1$ for all large $n$. Suppose $\\epsilon_k=1$ for all $k \\ge N$ for some large $N  M$. Then for $n  \\max(N, t-1)$, $d_n+1 = d_{n-t}+p$. This implies $d_n=p-1$ and $d_{n-t}=0$. This cannot hold for all $n  \\max(N,t-1)$, for instance it would imply $d_{n+t}=p-1$ and $d_n=0$, which contradicts $d_n=p-1$.\nThe only other possibility for a sustained train of carries is if $d_n$ is constant. For $n  \\max(M, t-1)$, if $d_n=p-1$ and $d_{n-t}=p-1$, the recurrence $d_n+\\epsilon_{n-1} = d_{n-t}+p\\epsilon_n$ becomes $p-1+\\epsilon_{n-1} = p-1+p\\epsilon_n$, implying $\\epsilon_{n-1}=p\\epsilon_n$. Since carries are small integers (usually $0$ or $1$), this forces $\\epsilon_{n-1}=\\epsilon_n=0$.\nTherefore, the sequence of carries must eventually become zero. Let $N$ be an integer such that for all $n \\ge N$, $\\epsilon_n=0$.\nThen for all $n  \\max(N, M, t-1)$, we have $d_n + 0 = d_{n-t} + p \\cdot 0$, which simplifies to $d_n = d_{n-t}$.\nThis shows that the sequence of digits $(d_n)$ is eventually periodic with a period that divides $t = \\text{ord}_b(p)$. The minimal period length is therefore a divisor of the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $b$.\nFor part (a), $p=5$, $b=13$, we check the order of $5$ modulo $13$: $5^1 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 12 \\equiv -1$, $5^3 \\equiv -5 \\equiv 8$, $5^4 \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.

Consider the difference between successive terms:\n$$\nx_{n+1} - x_n = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{1+p}{x_n}\\right) - x_n = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1+p}{x_n} - x_n\\right) = \\frac{1+p - x_n^2}{2x_n}\n$$\nThe $p$-adic absolute value is $|x_{n+1}-x_n|_p = \\frac{|x_n^2 - (1+p)|_p}{|2x_n|_p}$. Since $|2|_p=1$ and $|x_n|_p=1$, the denominator is $|2x_n|_p = 1$. Thus, $|x_{n+1}-x_n|_p = |x_n^2 - (1+p)|_p$.\n\nLet us analyze the term $d_n = x_n^2 - (1+p)$.\n$$\nd_{n+1} = x_{n+1}^2 - (1+p) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{1+p}{x_n}\\right) \\right)^2 - (1+p)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4} \\left( x_n^2 + 2(1+p) + \\frac{(1+p)^2}{x_n^2} \\right) - (1+p) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( x_n^2 - 2(1+p) + \\frac{(1+p)^2}{x_n^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4} \\left( x_n - \\frac{1+p}{x_n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4x_n^2} \\left( x_n^2 - (1+p) \\right)^2 = \\frac{d_n^2}{4x_n^2}\n$$\nTaking the $p$-adic valuation, $v_p(d_{n+1}) = v_p(d_n^2) - v_p(4x_n^2) = 2v_p(d_n) - (v_p(4) + 2v_p(x_n))$.\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $v_p(4)=0$. And we have shown $v_p(x_n)=0$. Thus, we have the recurrence $v_p(d_{n+1}) = 2v_p(d_n)$.\nLet's find the initial valuation $v_p(d_0)$.\n$d_0 = x_0^2 - (1+p) = 1^2 - (1+p) = -p$.\nSo, $v_p(d_0) = v_p(-p) = 1$.\nFrom the recurrence, we get $v_p(d_1) = 2v_p(d_0) = 2$, $v_p(d_2)=2v_p(d_1)=4$, and in general, $v_p(d_n) = 2^n v_p(d_0) = 2^n$.\nTherefore, $|x_{n+1}-x_n|_p = |d_n|_p = p^{-v_p(d_n)} = p^{-2^n}$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $2^n \\to \\infty$, so $p^{-2^n} \\to 0$. This shows $|x_{n+1}-x_n|_p \\to 0$.\nFor any $m  n$, the strong triangle inequality gives:\n$|x_m - x_n|_p = |(x_m-x_{m-1}) + \\dots + (x_{n+1}-x_n)|_p \\leq \\max_{k=n}^{m-1} |x_{k+1}-x_k|_p = \\max_{k=n}^{m-1} p^{-2^k} = p^{-2^n}$.\nSince $p^{-2^n} \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a complete metric space, the sequence converges to a limit $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nTaking the limit $n \\to \\infty$ in the recurrence for $x_n$, we get $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha + \\frac{1+p}{\\alpha})$, which simplifies to $2\\alpha^2 = \\alpha^2 + 1+p$, so $\\alpha^2 = 1+p$.\nSince $x_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ for all $n$, the limit $\\alpha$ must also satisfy this. Formally, $|x_n-1|_p \\le p^{-1}$ for all $n$, so $|\\alpha-1|_p = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |x_n-1|_p \\le p^{-1}$, which means $\\alpha \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\nFor uniqueness, suppose $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is another root such that $\\beta^2=1+p$ and $\\beta \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. Then $\\alpha^2 = \\beta^2$, so $(\\alpha-\\beta)(\\alpha+\\beta)=0$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is an integral domain, either $\\alpha=\\beta$ or $\\alpha=-\\beta$. From the congruence conditions, $\\alpha \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ and $\\beta \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, their sum is $\\alpha+\\beta \\equiv 2 \\pmod p$. As $p$ is an odd prime, $2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, so $\\alpha+\\beta$ is a $p$-adic unit and cannot be zero. Thus, we must have $\\alpha-\\beta=0$, which implies $\\alpha = \\beta$. This proves uniqueness.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the error $|x_n-\\alpha|_p$. Let $e_n = x_n-\\alpha$. Then $x_n = \\alpha+e_n$.\nThe Newton iteration step for the error is:\n$$\ne_{n+1} = x_{n+1}-\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{1+p}{x_n}\\right) - \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\alpha+e_n + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\alpha+e_n}\\right) - \\alpha\n$$\n$$\ne_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2(\\alpha+e_n)} \\left( (\\alpha+e_n)^2 + \\alpha^2 - 2\\alpha(\\alpha+e_n) \\right)\n$$\n$$\ne_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2(\\alpha+e_n)} \\left( \\alpha^2+2\\alpha e_n+e_n^2 + \\alpha^2 - 2\\alpha^2-2\\alpha e_n \\right) = \\frac{e_n^2}{2(\\alpha+e_n)}\n$$\nSince $x_n = \\alpha+e_n$, the recurrence for the error in terms of $e_n$ and $x_n$ is $e_{n+1} = \\frac{e_n^2}{2x_n}$.\n\nTo find the closed-form expression for $|x_n-\\alpha|_p = |e_n|_p$, we take the $p$-adic absolute value:\n$$\n|e_{n+1}|_p = \\frac{|e_n|_p^2}{|2x_n|_p}\n$$\nAs established earlier, $|x_n|_p=1$ and $|2|_p=1$ (for $p$ odd), so $|2x_n|_p = |2|_p|x_n|_p = 1$. The recurrence simplifies to:\n$$\n|e_{n+1}|_p = |e_n|_p^2\n$$\nThis shows that the convergence is quadratic. To find the closed form, we need the initial error $|e_0|_p$.\n$e_0 = x_0-\\alpha = 1-\\alpha$.\nTo find $|1-\\alpha|_p$, we use the property $\\alpha \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. We can write $\\alpha = 1+c$ where $v_p(c) \\geq 1$.\nSubstituting into $\\alpha^2 = 1+p$:\n$(1+c)^2 = 1+p \\implies 1+2c+c^2=1+p \\implies c(2+c)=p$.\nTaking valuations, $v_p(c) + v_p(2+c) = v_p(p) = 1$.\nSince $v_p(c) \\geq 1$, we have $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. Thus, $2+c \\equiv 2 \\pmod p$.\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $v_p(2)=0$, so $v_p(2+c)=0$.\nThe valuation equation becomes $v_p(c) + 0 = 1$, so $v_p(c)=1$.\nThe initial error is $e_0 = 1-\\alpha = -c$. Its absolute value is $|e_0|_p = |-c|_p = |c|_p = p^{-v_p(c)} = p^{-1}$.\nWe now solve the recurrence $|e_{n+1}|_p = |e_n|_p^2$ with $|e_0|_p = p^{-1}$.\nFor $n=1$: $|e_1|_p = |e_0|_p^2 = (p^{-1})^2 = p^{-2}$.\nFor $n=2$: $|e_2|_p = |e_1|_p^2 = (p^{-2})^2 = p^{-4}$.\nBy induction, assume $|e_k|_p = p^{-2^k}$. Then $|e_{k+1}|_p = |e_k|_p^2 = (p^{-2^k})^2 = p^{-2 \\cdot 2^k} = p^{-2^{k+1}}$.\nThe formula holds for all $n \\geq 0$.\n\nThe problem asks for $|x_n - \\sqrt{1+p}|_p$, where $\\sqrt{1+p}$ denotes the specific root $\\alpha$ we have constructed. Thus, the final expression is $|x_n - \\alpha|_p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p^{-2^n}}\n$$", "id": "3086429"}]}
