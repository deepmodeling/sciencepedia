No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the construction of a generating function for $R_{s,2}(n)$, the number of ways to write an integer $n$ as a sum of $s$ squares of integers. It then asks for the specific value of $R_{3,2}(5)$ to be computed using this generating function and verified by direct enumeration.\n\nFirst, we construct the generating function. The problem is to find the number of ordered $s$-tuples of integers $(x_1, \\ldots, x_s) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^s$ such that $x_1^2 + \\cdots + x_s^2 = n$. According to the principles of ordinary generating functions, we associate a formal variable $x$ with a \"weight\". In this problem, the weight of an integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is its square, $k^2$.\n\nLet's consider the case of a single variable, $s=1$. We are counting the number of integers $x_1$ such that $x_1^2=n$. The generating function for the squares of all possible integers $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is formed by summing terms $x^{k^2}$ over all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let this function be $\\theta(x)$:\n$$ \\theta(x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} x^{k^2} = \\sum_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{k^2} $$\nWe can write this sum more explicitly by separating the $k=0$ term and combining the terms for $k$ and $-k$ for $k0$. Since $k^2 = (-k)^2$ for any integer $k$, we have:\n$$ \\theta(x) = x^{0^2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (x^{k^2} + x^{(-k)^2}) = 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2x^{k^2} $$\nThe first few terms are:\n$$ \\theta(x) = 1 + 2x^{1^2} + 2x^{2^2} + 2x^{3^2} + \\dots = 1 + 2x + 2x^4 + 2x^9 + 2x^{16} + \\dots $$\nThe coefficient of $x^n$ in $\\theta(x)$ is the number of integers $k$ such that $k^2=n$. This is $1$ if $n=0$ (from $k=0$), $2$ if $n$ is a perfect square of a non-zero integer (from $k$ and $-k$), and $0$ otherwise. This is $R_{1,2}(n)$.\n\nNow, we generalize to an $s$-tuple $(x_1, \\ldots, x_s)$. We are seeking the number of solutions to $x_1^2 + \\cdots + x_s^2 = n$. The total weight $n$ is the sum of the weights of $s$ independent choices of integers. The generating function for a sum of weights of independent objects is the product of their individual generating functions. Since each variable $x_i$ is an integer whose square contributes to the sum, the generating function for each is $\\theta(x)$. For $s$ such variables, the total generating function, which we denote as $G_{s}(x)$, is the product of $s$ copies of $\\theta(x)$:\n$$ G_s(x) = (\\theta(x))^s = \\left( \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} x^{k^2} \\right)^s $$\nBy construction, the coefficient of $x^n$ in the Maclaurin series expansion of $G_s(x)$ is the number of ways to choose integers $k_1, \\ldots, k_s$ such that $k_1^2 + \\cdots + k_s^2 = n$. This is precisely the definition of $R_{s,2}(n)$. Therefore,\n$$ G_s(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} R_{s,2}(n) x^n $$\n\nNext, we use this construction to compute $R_{3,2}(5)$. This is the coefficient of $x^5$ in the expansion of $G_3(x) = (\\theta(x))^3$. We denote this coefficient as $[x^5] G_3(x)$.\n$$ \\theta(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^4 + 2x^9 + \\dots $$\nTo find the coefficient of $x^5$ in $(\\theta(x))^3$, we only need the terms in $\\theta(x)$ up to degree $5$. Thus, we can truncate the series and consider the cube of the polynomial $P(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^4$.\nWe need to find $[x^5] (1 + 2x + 2x^4)^3$.\nLet's consider the product of three factors: $(1 + 2x + 2x^4)(1 + 2x + 2x^4)(1 + 2x + 2x^4)$.\nTo obtain a term with $x^5$, we must select one term from each factor, say $c_1x^{p_1}$, $c_2x^{p_2}$, and $c_3x^{p_3}$, such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 5$. The available powers from $P(x)$ are $0$, $1$, and $4$. The only way to sum these to $5$ is by using one of each: $0+1+4=5$.\nThis means we must choose the term with power $4$ from one factor, the term with power $1$ from another factor, and the term with power $0$ from the remaining factor.\nThe coefficients associated with powers $0, 1, 4$ in $P(x)$ are $1, 2, 2$ respectively.\nThere are $3! = 6$ ways to assign the powers $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$ to the three factors:\n1.  Power $0$ from factor 1, power $1$ from factor 2, power $4$ from factor 3: coefficient product is $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n2.  Power $0$ from factor 1, power $4$ from factor 2, power $1$ from factor 3: coefficient product is $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n3.  Power $1$ from factor 1, power $0$ from factor 2, power $4$ from factor 3: coefficient product is $2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n4.  Power $1$ from factor 1, power $4$ from factor 2, power $0$ from factor 3: coefficient product is $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 4$.\n5.  Power $4$ from factor 1, power $0$ from factor 2, power $1$ from factor 3: coefficient product is $2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n6.  Power $4$ from factor 1, power $1$ from factor 2, power $0$ from factor 3: coefficient product is $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 4$.\nThe total coefficient of $x^5$ is the sum of these products:\n$$ R_{3,2}(5) = [x^5] G_3(x) = 4+4+4+4+4+4 = 6 \\times 4 = 24 $$\n\nFinally, we verify this result by direct enumeration. We need to find all integer triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ such that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 5$.\nThe squares of integers are $0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \\dots$. Since the sum is $5$, the squares involved must be less than or equal to $5$. The only possible squares are $0$, $1$, and $4$.\nWe must find three of these numbers (repetition allowed) that sum to $5$. The unique combination is $4+1+0=5$.\nThis means that the set of the squares of the coordinates, $\\{x_1^2, x_2^2, x_3^2\\}$, must be a permutation of $\\{4, 1, 0\\}$. Consequently, the set of the absolute values of the coordinates, $\\{|x_1|, |x_2|, |x_3|\\}$, must be a permutation of $\\{\\sqrt{4}, \\sqrt{1}, \\sqrt{0}\\} = \\{2, 1, 0\\}$.\n\nWe now count the number of integer triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ that satisfy this condition.\n1.  **Permutations of absolute values:** The three distinct absolute values $\\{2, 1, 0\\}$ can be assigned to the coordinates $(|x_1|, |x_2|, |x_3|)$ in $3! = 6$ ways. These are $(2,1,0)$, $(2,0,1)$, $(1,2,0)$, $(1,0,2)$, $(0,1,2)$, and $(0,2,1)$.\n2.  **Assignment of signs:** For each such ordered triple of absolute values, we consider the possible signs of the integers.\n    - An absolute value of $2$ corresponds to integers $\\pm 2$ (2 choices).\n    - An absolute value of $1$ corresponds to integers $\\pm 1$ (2 choices).\n    - An absolute value of $0$ corresponds to integer $0$ (1 choice).\nFor any given permutation of an absolute value triple, say $(2,1,0)$, the number of corresponding integer triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is the product of the number of sign choices for each component: $2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4$. For example, for the order $(2,1,0)$, we have the triples $(2,1,0)$, $(2,-1,0)$, $(-2,1,0)$, and $(-2,-1,0)$.\n\nSince there are $6$ possible permutations of the absolute values, and each gives rise to $4$ distinct integer triples, the total number of solutions is:\n$$ R_{3,2}(5) = (\\text{Number of permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of sign choices per permutation}) = 6 \\times 4 = 24 $$\nThe result from direct enumeration matches the result from the generating function.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{24}\n$$", "id": "3093995"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the manual use of generating functions, this practice focuses on automation and generalization.

The goal is to compute $R_{s,k}(n)$ exactly for small $n$, $s$, and $k$, using methods grounded in first principles of counting and generating functions, and to validate the computed values against a brute-force enumeration of all ordered $s$-tuples.\n\nStart from the foundational counting principle and the definition of a generating function. For a fixed integer $k \\ge 1$, define the $k$-th power indicator generating function $$G_k(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} x^{m^k}.$$ The coefficient of $x^n$ in the finite truncation of the power series $$\\left(G_k(x)\\right)^s$$ is, by definition of generating functions and the distributive law, the number of ways to select $s$ terms $x^{a_1^k}, x^{a_2^k}, \\dots, x^{a_s^k}$ whose exponents sum to $n$, which equals $R_{s,k}(n)$. This also implies a recursion based on the decomposition of the last term: if we define $$f_{s,k}(n) = R_{s,k}(n),$$ then $$f_{0,k}(n) = \\begin{cases}1  \\text{if } n=0,\\\\ 0  \\text{if } n \\ne 0,\\end{cases}$$ and for $s \\ge 1$, $$f_{s,k}(n) = \\sum_{m \\ge 0,\\, m^k \\le n} f_{s-1,k}\\big(n - m^k\\big).$$ These identities follow directly from the generating function and the rule for multiplying series.\n\nYou must implement two exact procedures for computing $R_{s,k}(n)$:\n- A generating function method that builds the truncated polynomial $G_k(x)$ up to degree $n$ and then computes the coefficient of $x^n$ in $\\left(G_k(x)\\right)^s$ by repeated truncated polynomial convolution.\n- A recursion using memoization based on $$f_{s,k}(n) = \\sum_{m \\ge 0,\\, m^k \\le n} f_{s-1,k}(n - m^k),$$ initialized with $$f_{0,k}(0)=1$$ and $$f_{0,k}(n)=0$$ for $$n \\ne 0.$$\n\nTo validate correctness, implement a brute-force enumeration that counts the number of ordered $s$-tuples of nonnegative integers whose $k$-th powers sum to $n$, and compare its count to the counts produced by both the generating function method and the recursion. All computations are purely mathematical; no physical or angle units are involved.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter values $(n,s,k)$:\n- Test case $1$: $(n,s,k) = (17,3,2)$.\n- Test case $2$: $(n,s,k) = (0,5,3)$.\n- Test case $3$: $(n,s,k) = (1,0,4)$.\n- Test case $4$: $(n,s,k) = (0,0,2)$.\n- Test case $5$: $(n,s,k) = (7,4,1)$.\n- Test case $6$: $(n,s,k) = (50,2,3)$.\n- Test case $7$: $(n,s,k) = (10,4,2)$.\n\nYour program must compute $R_{s,k}(n)$ for each test case using the generating function method, validate each against both the recursion and brute-force enumeration, and aggregate the results into a single output line. The required final output format is a single line containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with the $7$ computed integers $R_{s,k}(n)$ for the test cases in the given order, followed by a final boolean indicating whether all validations succeeded across all test cases. For example, the output must have the form $$[R_1,R_2,R_3,R_4,R_5,R_6,R_7,\\text{all\\_valid}]$$ where each $R_i$ is an integer and $$\\text{all\\_valid}$$ is either $$\\text{True}$$ or $$\\text{False}.$$", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of $R_{s,k}(n)$, defined as the number of ordered $s$-tuples of non-negative integers $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_s)$ satisfying the Diophantine equation $a_1^k + a_2^k + \\cdots + a_s^k = n$. The integers $n$, $s$, and $k$ are given parameters, with $n \\ge 0$, $s \\ge 0$, and $k \\ge 1$. The problem mandates the implementation and cross-validation of three distinct algorithms: a generating function approach, a recursive method with memoization, and a direct brute-force enumeration.\n\nThe validation of the problem statement proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Extract Givens**: The problem provides the precise definition of $R_{s,k}(n)$, the formulations for a generating function method and a recursive method, and a suite of $7$ test cases with parameters $(n,s,k)$.\n2.  **Validate**: The problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in the established principles of number theory and combinatorics, specifically related to Waring's problem. The definitions and recurrence relations are standard and mathematically sound. The problem is well-posed, as for any finite inputs, a unique and finite integer solution for $R_{s,k}(n)$ exists. All terms are defined unambiguously. There are no contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific claims. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nHerein, we outline the theoretical foundation and implementation strategy for each of the three required methods.\n\n### 1. Generating Function Method\nThis method leverages the fundamental property of generating functions where the exponents add upon multiplication of terms. We define a generating function for the $k$-th powers of non-negative integers:\n$$G_k(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} x^{m^k} = 1 + x^{1^k} + x^{2^k} + x^{3^k} + \\cdots$$\nThe $s$-th power of this function, $(G_k(x))^s$, is the product of $s$ such series:\n$$\\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} x^{m^k}\\right)^s = \\left(x^{a_1^k} + x^{a_2^k} + \\cdots \\right) \\left(x^{b_1^k} + x^{b_2^k} + \\cdots \\right) \\cdots \\left(x^{c_1^k} + x^{c_2^k} + \\cdots \\right)$$\nBy the distributive law, a generic term in the expanded product is of the form $x^{a_i^k} x^{b_j^k} \\cdots x^{c_l^k} = x^{a_i^k + b_j^k + \\cdots + c_l^k}$. The coefficient of $x^n$ in the resulting power series, denoted $[x^n](G_k(x))^s$, is precisely the number of ways to form the sum $n$ from $s$ terms, where each term is a $k$-th power of a non-negative integer. This is, by definition, $R_{s,k}(n)$.\n\nFor computation, we only need coefficients up to degree $n$. Thus, we use truncated polynomials.\n- First, construct the polynomial representation of $G_k(x)$ up to degree $n$: $P_k(x) = \\sum_{m=0, m^k \\le n} x^{m^k}$. This is represented as an array of coefficients.\n- Then, compute $(P_k(x))^s$ using repeated polynomial convolution. If $P(x)$ is the polynomial representation of the result at a given step, the next step involves computing $P(x) \\cdot P_k(x)$. After each convolution, the resulting polynomial is truncated to degree $n$, as higher-degree terms do not contribute to the coefficient of $x^n$.\n- The final result is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the polynomial $(P_k(x))^s$.\nThe edge case $s=0$ corresponds to $(G_k(x))^0 = 1$, which means $R_{0,k}(0)=1$ and $R_{0,k}(n)=0$ for $n0$.\n\n### 2. Recursive Method with Memoization\nThe problem can be decomposed by considering the value of one of the integers in the tuple, say $a_s$. If $a_s = m$, then the remaining $s-1$ integers must satisfy $a_1^k + \\cdots + a_{s-1}^k = n - m^k$. Summing over all possible non-negative integer values of $m$ such that $m^k \\le n$, we obtain the recurrence relation for $f_{s,k}(n) = R_{s,k}(n)$:\n$$f_{s,k}(n) = \\sum_{m=0, m^k \\le n} f_{s-1, k}(n - m^k) \\quad \\text{for } s \\ge 1.$$\nThe recursion requires base cases. For $s=0$, the sum has zero terms and is equal to $0$. Thus, there is one way to achieve the sum $n=0$ (with the empty tuple) and zero ways to achieve any $n0$.\n$$f_{0,k}(n) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } n=0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } n0 \\end{cases}$$\nThis recursive structure leads to re-computation of the same subproblems, e.g., $f_{s',n'}$ for various paths. To avoid this exponential complexity, memoization is employed. A cache stores the results for each pair $(s, n)$, and any subsequent call with the same parameters retrieves the stored result directly.\n\n### 3. Brute-Force Enumeration Method\nThis method is the most direct interpretation of the problem definition. It consists of systematically generating and testing all possible ordered $s$-tuples $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_s)$ of non-negative integers.\nA recursive search algorithm can be constructed to explore the space of tuples. Let a function `search(depth, current_sum)` be defined.\n- `depth` is the index of the tuple element being chosen, from $1$ to $s$.\n- `current_sum` is the sum of the $k$-th powers of the elements chosen so far.\nThe search proceeds as follows:\n- The base case for the recursion is `depth`$=s$. If `current_sum` equals $n$, a valid tuple has been found, and a counter is incremented.\n- In the recursive step (for `depth` $ s$), the algorithm iterates through all possible integer values $m \\ge 0$ for the current element $a_{\\text{depth}+1}$. A crucial optimization is to constrain the search space: since all terms are non-negative, we must have $m^k \\le n - \\text{current\\_sum}$. This prunes branches of the search tree that cannot lead to a solution. For each valid $m$, the function calls itself with `search(depth + 1, current_sum + m^k)`.\nThe initial call is `search(0, 0)`, and the final value of the counter is $R_{s,k}(n)$. For the test cases provided, this approach is computationally feasible.\n\nThe implemented solution computes $R_{s,k}(n)$ for each test case using all three methods and confirms that their results are identical, thereby providing a strong validation of the correctness of the primary generating function method. The final output aggregates the results from the generating function method and a boolean flag indicating the success of this comprehensive validation.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef r_gen_func(n, s, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes R_s,k(n) using the generating function method with polynomial convolution.\n    R_s,k(n) is the coefficient of x^n in (sum_{m=0 to inf} x^(m^k))^s.\n    \"\"\"\n    if s == 0:\n        return 1 if n == 0 else 0\n    if n == 0 and s  0:\n        # a_1^k + ... + a_s^k = 0 implies all a_i must be 0.\n        # Only one solution: (0, 0, ..., 0).\n        return 1\n\n    # Build the base polynomial for G_k(x) up to degree n.\n    # We use dtype=object to handle potentially large integers without overflow.\n    g_k_poly = np.zeros(n + 1, dtype=object)\n    \n    # Calculate terms x^(m^k) for m^k = n\n    if k  0:\n        limit = int(n**(1/k))\n        for m in range(limit + 1):\n            power = m**k\n            g_k_poly[power] = 1\n    # For k=0, this would behave differently, but problem constraint is k=1.\n    \n    # Compute the s-th power of the polynomial using repeated convolution.\n    result_poly = g_k_poly.copy()\n    for _ in range(s - 1):\n        # np.convolve computes the coefficients of the product of two polynomials.\n        # We truncate the result to degree n as higher terms are not needed.\n        result_poly = np.convolve(result_poly, g_k_poly)[:n + 1]\n    \n    return int(result_poly[n])\n\ndef r_recursive(n, s, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes R_s,k(n) using recursion with memoization.\n    f(s,n) = sum_{m=0, m^k=n} f(s-1, n - m^k)\n    \"\"\"\n    memo = {}\n\n    def worker(s_curr, n_curr):\n        if (s_curr, n_curr) in memo:\n            return memo[(s_curr, n_curr)]\n        \n        if s_curr == 0:\n            return 1 if n_curr == 0 else 0\n\n        total = 0\n        if k  0:\n            try:\n                limit = int(n_curr**(1/k))\n            except ValueError: # n_curr  0\n                return 0\n                \n            for m in range(limit + 1):\n                total += worker(s_curr - 1, n_curr - m**k)\n        \n        memo[(s_curr, n_curr)] = total\n        return total\n    \n    return worker(s, n)\n\ndef r_brute_force(n, s, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes R_s,k(n) by direct enumeration of all valid s-tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    if s == 0:\n        return 1 if n == 0 else 0\n\n    # Using a list as a mutable integer for the nonlocal counter\n    count = [0]\n    \n    def find_tuples(depth, current_sum):\n        if depth == s:\n            if current_sum == n:\n                count[0] += 1\n            return\n            \n        remaining_sum = n - current_sum\n        if remaining_sum  0:\n            return\n\n        # Pruning the search space.\n        try:\n            limit = int(remaining_sum**(1/k))\n        except ValueError:\n            return # remaining_sum is negative.\n        \n        for m in range(limit + 1):\n            find_tuples(depth + 1, current_sum + m**k)\n\n    find_tuples(0, 0)\n    return count[0]\n\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run test cases, validate results, and print the output.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # (n, s, k)\n        (17, 3, 2),\n        (0, 5, 3),\n        (1, 0, 4),\n        (0, 0, 2),\n        (7, 4, 1),\n        (50, 2, 3),\n        (10, 4, 2),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    all_valid = True\n\n    for i, (n, s, k) in enumerate(test_cases):\n        # Compute the result using the three specified methods.\n        res_gen = r_gen_func(n, s, k)\n        res_rec = r_recursive(n, s, k)\n        res_bf = r_brute_force(n, s, k)\n        \n        # Validate that all methods yield the same result.\n        if not (res_gen == res_rec == res_bf):\n            all_valid = False\n            # Optional: uncomment for debugging mismatches.\n            # print(f\"Validation failed for case ({n},{s},{k}):\")\n            # print(f\"  GenFunc: {res_gen}, Recursive: {res_rec}, BruteForce: {res_bf}\")\n\n        results.append(res_gen)\n\n    results.append(all_valid)\n    \n    # Format the final output as specified.\n    # The map(str, ...) will correctly convert the boolean to \"True\" or \"False\".\n    output_str = f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3093990"}, {"introduction": "Having explored methods for counting the number of representations, we now shift our focus to the central question of Waring's problem: finding the *minimal* number of $k$-th powers needed to represent an integer.

Waring’s problem states that there exists a smallest integer $g(k)$ such that every positive integer $n$ can be expressed as a sum of at most $g(k)$ $k$-th powers of nonnegative integers. For this task, you will work with the following widely known values: $g(2)=4$, $g(3)=9$, and $g(4)=19$. For a given pair $(n,k)$, define the following two quantities based on fundamental definitions.\n- The greedy $k$-th power count $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$ is obtained by iteratively subtracting the largest $k$-th power not exceeding the current remainder, starting from $n$, until the remainder reaches $0$. The number of subtractions performed is $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$.\n- The minimal $k$-th power count $t_{\\min}(n,k)$ is the least number of $k$-th powers whose sum equals $n$.\n\nYour task is to design and implement a complete program that, for each test pair $(n,k)$ in the suite below, computes $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$ and $t_{\\min}(n,k)$ from first principles. The computations must proceed from the definitions above without using any prepackaged solver or external data. For each pair $(n,k)$, compare the greedy count with the minimal count and also record the known bound $g(k)$. Your program must output, for each test pair, the list $[n,k,t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k),t_{\\min}(n,k),\\ \\text{greedy\\_is\\_minimal},\\ g(k)]$, where $\\text{greedy\\_is\\_minimal}$ is a boolean indicating whether $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)=t_{\\min}(n,k)$.\n\nUse only pure mathematical integers. No physical units or angles are involved. The final output must be a single line containing a comma-separated list (in increasing order of appearance) of the per-case lists and enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[[\\cdot],[\\cdot],\\ldots]$.\n\nTest suite to cover varied behaviors, including boundary conditions:\n- Squares ($k=2$): $(n,k)$ equal to $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,2)$, $(12,2)$, $(50,2)$, $(130,2)$.\n- Cubes ($k=3$): $(1,3)$, $(2,3)$, $(15,3)$, $(17,3)$, $(24,3)$, $(35,3)$.\n- Fourth powers ($k=4$): $(1,4)$, $(17,4)$, $(32,4)$, $(97,4)$, $(98,4)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, namely the list\n$[[n_1,k_1,t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n_1,k_1),t_{\\min}(n_1,k_1),\\ \\text{bool}_1,\\ g(k_1)],\\ldots,[n_m,k_m,t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n_m,k_m),t_{\\min}(n_m,k_m),\\ \\text{bool}_m,\\ g(k_m)]]$\nfor all listed test cases in the order presented above. Each $n_i$, $k_i$, and $g(k_i)$ must be integers, and each $\\text{bool}_i$ must be a boolean.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of two quantities, the greedy $k$-th power count $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$ and the minimal $k$-th power count $t_{\\min}(n,k)$, for a set of given integer pairs $(n,k)$. The integer $k$ is an exponent from the set $\\{2,3,4\\}$. The problem is a specific instance of the number-theoretic topic known as Waring's problem, which asserts that for any given integer $k \\ge 2$, there is a finite number $g(k)$ such that any positive integer $n$ can be expressed as a sum of at most $g(k)$ $k$-th powers of non-negative integers. The problem provides the known values $g(2)=4$, $g(3)=9$, and $g(4)=19$.\n\nThe core of the task is to implement and compare two distinct algorithmic approaches: a greedy algorithm and an optimal one.\n\n**1. The Greedy Algorithm for $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$**\n\nThe quantity $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$ is defined by a greedy procedure. Starting with an integer $n$, we find the largest integer $m \\ge 1$ such that its $k$-th power, $m^k$, does not exceed $n$. We subtract this value from $n$ to obtain a new remainder. This process is repeated until the remainder becomes $0$. The total number of subtractions is $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$.\n\nLet the sequence of remainders be $r_0, r_1, \\dots, r_t$, where $r_0 = n$. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\nFor $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ until $r_i=0$:\n1. Find the largest integer $m_i \\ge 1$ such that $m_i^k \\le r_i$. This $m_i$ is given by $m_i = \\lfloor r_i^{1/k} \\rfloor$.\n2. Define the next remainder as $r_{i+1} = r_i - m_i^k$.\n3. The process terminates when a remainder $r_t = 0$ is reached. The number of terms is $t = t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$.\n\nFor example, to compute $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(12,2)$:\n- Start with $r_0=12$. The largest square less than or equal to $12$ is $3^2=9$.\n- The remainder is $r_1 = 12 - 9 = 3$. This is the first term.\n- For $r_1=3$, the largest square $\\le 3$ is $1^2=1$.\n- The remainder is $r_2 = 3 - 1 = 2$. This is the second term.\n- For $r_2=2$, the largest square $\\le 2$ is $1^2=1$.\n- The remainder is $r_3 = 2 - 1 = 1$. This is the third term.\n- For $r_3=1$, the largest square $\\le 1$ is $1^2=1$.\n- The remainder is $r_4 = 1 - 1 = 0$. This is the fourth term.\nThe process terminates. The total number of terms is $4$. Thus, $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(12,2) = 4$. The representation is $12=3^2+1^2+1^2+1^2$.\n\n**2. The Optimal Algorithm for $t_{\\min}(n,k)$**\n\nThe quantity $t_{\\min}(n,k)$ is the smallest number of $k$-th powers of non-negative integers that sum to $n$. This is an optimization problem, which the greedy approach does not guarantee to solve. For instance, for $(n,k)=(12,2)$, we saw the greedy approach yields $4$ terms, but $12$ can be represented as $2^2+2^2+2^2$, which is only $3$ terms. Thus, $t_{\\min}(12,2)=3$.\n\nTo find the minimal number of terms, we can model the problem as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The vertices of the graph are the integers from $0$ to $n$. A directed edge exists from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ if $i-j = m^k$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$. The problem is then to find the length of the shortest path from vertex $n$ to vertex $0$. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a standard algorithm for this task.\n\nAn equivalent and commonly used technique is dynamic programming. Let $T(i)$ be the minimal number of $k$-th powers that sum to the integer $i$. Our goal is to compute $T(n)$. The base case is $T(0)=0$, as $0$ is the sum of zero terms. For any $i  0$, we can form a sum for $i$ by taking a $k$-th power $m^k \\le i$ and adding it to an optimal representation for $i-m^k$. This leads to the recurrence relation:\n$$T(i) = 1 + \\min_{m \\ge 1, m^k \\le i} \\{ T(i - m^k) \\}$$\nThis recurrence can be solved iteratively by computing $T(1), T(2), \\dots, T(n)$ in order.\n\nFor example, to compute $t_{\\min}(12,2)$ using this method where $k=2$:\n- $T(0)=0$.\n- $T(1)=1+T(0)=1$. ($1=1^2$)\n- $T(2)=1+T(1)=2$. ($2=1^2+1^2$)\n- $T(3)=1+T(2)=3$. ($3=1^2+1^2+1^2$)\n- $T(4)=\\min(1+T(3), 1+T(0)) = 1+T(0)=1$. ($4=2^2$)\n- ...and so on.\n- $T(8)=\\min(1+T(7), 1+T(4)) = 1+T(4) = 1+1=2$. ($8=2^2+2^2$)\n- $T(12)=\\min(1+T(11), 1+T(8), 1+T(3))$. We would have already computed $T(11)=3$, $T(8)=2$, and $T(3)=3$.\n- $T(12)=\\min(1+3, 1+2, 1+3) = 3$.\nSo, $t_{\\min}(12,2)=3$.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\nThe final program implements these two algorithms to process each $(n,k)$ pair from the test suite.\nA function `compute_greedy(n,k)` implements the iterative subtraction method. Another function `compute_min(n,k)` implements the dynamic programming approach. For each test case $(n,k)$, these functions are called to get $t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k)$ and $t_{\\min}(n,k)$. The results are compared to determine the boolean value $\\text{greedy\\_is\\_minimal}$. The known value of $g(k)$ is retrieved from a predefined mapping. The resulting list $[n,k,t_{\\mathrm{greedy}}(n,k),t_{\\min}(n,k), \\text{greedy\\_is\\_minimal}, g(k)]$ is constructed and added to a list for all test cases, which is then formatted into the required single-line string output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n# from scipy import ...\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Waring's problem variant for a given test suite.\n    Computes and compares greedy and minimal k-th power sum decompositions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def compute_greedy(n: int, k: int) - int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the number of terms in a greedy decomposition of n into k-th powers.\n        \"\"\"\n        count = 0\n        remainder = n\n        while remainder  0:\n            # For the given constraints, float precision is not an issue.\n            # int(x**(1/k)) correctly finds floor(k-th root).\n            base = int(remainder**(1/k))\n            if base == 0:\n                # This can only happen if remainder is between 0 and 1,\n                # but since we work with integers, it means remainder is an\n                # integer  0 but less than 2**k.
