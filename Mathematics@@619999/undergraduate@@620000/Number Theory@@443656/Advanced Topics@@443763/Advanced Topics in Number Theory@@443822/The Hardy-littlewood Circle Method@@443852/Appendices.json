Let $k = n^2 - m^2$. The integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} \\exp(2\\pi i k \\alpha) d\\alpha$. This is a fundamental orthogonality relation for the characters of the circle group $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nCase 1: $k=0$. This occurs when $n^2 - m^2 = 0$.

This can be written using the Kronecker delta as $\\delta_{n^2, m^2}$.\n\nThe expression for $I(N)$ simplifies to a sum over the pairs $(n, m)$ for which $n^2 - m^2 = 0$:\n$$\nI(N) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\sum_{m=1}^{N} \\delta_{n^2, m^2}.\n$$\nThe condition $n^2 = m^2$ with the constraints that $n$ and $m$ are positive integers (since $n,m \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$) implies that $n = m$.\nTherefore, the only non-zero terms in the double sum are those on the \"diagonal\" where $n=m$.

The value of the sum is $N$.\nSo, the exact closed-form expression for the integral is:\n$$\nI(N) = N.\n$$\n\nThe combinatorial interpretation of $I(N)$ follows directly from this derivation.

There are exactly $N$ such solutions. This confirms that $I(N) = N$.\n\nThis problem serves as a simple model for the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. In that method, integrals of products of exponential sums are used to count solutions to Diophantine equations. The integral $I(N) = \\int_0^1 |S(\\alpha)|^2 d\\alpha$ counts solutions to $n^2=m^2$. The solutions $n=m$ are referred to as \"diagonal\" solutions. In more complex problems, like counting solutions to $n_1^k + n_2^k = m_1^k + m_2^k$, the diagonal solutions (where $\\{n_1, n_2\\}$ is a permutation of $\\{m_1, m_2\\}$) are expected to provide the dominant contribution to the corresponding integral. The calculation of $I(N)$ demonstrates this principle in a context where the diagonal solutions are the only solutions that exist.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine for which values of $n$ the congruence $x_1^3 + x_2^3 \\equiv n \\pmod{9}$ has solutions. To do this, we first need to determine the possible values of a single cube, $x^3$, modulo $9$. We can compute this for each residue class $x \\pmod{9}$.\n\nLet $x$ be an integer. We examine $x^3 \\pmod{9}$.\n*   If $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $x=3m$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $x^3 = (3m)^3 = 27m^3 = 3 \\cdot 9 \\cdot m^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. This covers $x \\equiv 0, 3, 6 \\pmod{9}$.\n    *   $0^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $6^3 = 216 = 24 \\times 9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n*   If $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $x=3m+1$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $x^3 = (3m+1)^3 = (3m)^3 + 3(3m)^2(1) + 3(3m)(1)^2 + 1^3 = 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$. This covers $x \\equiv 1, 4, 7 \\pmod{9}$.\n    *   $1^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $4^3 = 64 = 7 \\times 9 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $7^3 = 343 = 38 \\times 9 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$\n*   If $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $x=3m+2$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $x^3 = (3m+2)^3 = (3m)^3 + 3(3m)^2(2) + 3(3m)(2)^2 + 2^3 = 27m^3 + 54m^2 + 36m + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$. This covers $x \\equiv 2, 5, 8 \\pmod{9}$.\n    *   $2^3 = 8 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $5^3 = 125 = 13 \\times 9 + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$\n    *   $8^3 = 512 = 56 \\times 9 + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$\n\nSo, the set of all possible values for a cube modulo $9$ is $C = \\{0, 1, 8\\}$.\n\nNext, we find the possible values for the sum of two cubes, $x_1^3 + x_2^3$, modulo $9$. We need to compute all possible sums of two elements from the set $C$:\n*   $0+0 = 0$\n*   $0+1 = 1$\n*   $0+8 = 8$\n*   $1+1 = 2$\n*   $1+8 = 9 \\equiv 0$\n*   $8+8 = 16 \\equiv 7$\n\nThe set of all possible values for $x_1^3 + x_2^3 \\pmod{9}$ is $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 7, 8\\}$.\n\nThe congruence $x_1^3 + x_2^3 \\equiv n \\pmod{9}$ has no solutions if $n$ is not in the set $S$. The set of all residues modulo $9$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$. The residues not present in $S$ are $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nTherefore, for $n \\equiv 3, 4, 5, 6 \\pmod{9}$, the congruence has no solutions.\n\nThis finding relates to the singular series $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n)$. The singular series is a product of local densities, $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n) = \\prod_p \\chi_p(n)$. The local density at a prime $p$ is $\\chi_p(n) = \\sum_{a=0}^\\infty M_p(n, a)$, where $M_p(n, a)$ is related to the number of solutions modulo powers of $p$. A more direct definition is $\\chi_p(n) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{N(p^t; n)}{p^{t(s-1)}}$, where $N(p^t; n)$ is the number of solutions to the congruence modulo $p^t$.\nIf for some $t_0$, $N(p^{t_0}; n) = 0$, then for any $t > t_0$, $N(p^t; n) = 0$. This is because any solution modulo $p^t$ must also be a solution modulo $p^{t_0}$. If there are no solutions modulo $p^{t_0}$, there can be none modulo $p^t$.\nIn our case, with $s=2, k=3$ and the modulus $9=3^2$, we are examining the local behavior at the prime $p=3$. We found that for $n \\equiv 3, 4, 5, 6 \\pmod{9}$, the number of solutions to $x_1^3+x_2^3\\equiv n\\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ 3^2)$ is $N(3^2; n) = 0$.\nThis implies that for any $t \\ge 2$, $N(3^t; n)=0$ for these values of $n$.\nConsequently, the local density at $p=3$ is\n$$ \\chi_3(n) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{N(3^t; n)}{3^{t(2-1)}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{0}{3^t} = 0 $$\nSince one of the factors in the product $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n) = \\chi_2(n) \\chi_3(n) \\chi_5(n) \\cdots$ is zero, the entire singular series vanishes: $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n) = 0$.

We found that $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ is an attainable value. For example, $x_1=3, x_2=6$ gives $3^3+6^3 = 27+216=243$, which is congruent to $0 \\pmod{9}$.

This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nE. **Such a congruence obstruction can only arise at a prime modulus, not at a composite modulus like $9$, so $\\mathfrak{S}_{2,3}(n)$ cannot vanish due to conditions modulo $9$.**\nThis statement fundamentally misunderstands the theory of local solubility in Waring's problem. Local obstructions are investigated at prime power moduli $p^t$. In many cases, particularly when $p$ divides $k$, one must investigate moduli $p^t$ with $t>1$ to find obstructions.

Dividing by $2^t$, we obtain a linear congruence for $\\mathbf{b}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$$\nk + 3 \\sum_{i=1}^{s} a_i^2 b_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2},\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{s} (a_i^2 \\pmod{2}) b_i \\equiv k \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nThe number of solutions for $\\mathbf{b}$ depends on the vector of coefficients $(a_1^2 \\pmod{2}, \\dots, a_s^2 \\pmod{2})$. The coefficient $a_i^2 \\pmod{2}$ is $1$ if $a_i$ is odd, and $0$ if $a_i$ is even. A non-trivial linear equation in $s$ variables over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ has $2^{s-1}$ solutions. The equation is trivial only if all coefficients are zero. Let's show this is not the case.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{a}$ to be a solution to $\\sum a_i^3 \\equiv n \\pmod{2^t}$ with $n$ odd, the sum $\\sum a_i^3$ must be odd. For an integer $x$, $x^3$ is odd if and only if $x$ is odd. Therefore, for the sum of cubes to be odd, there must be an odd number of odd cubes. This implies that at least one of the components $a_i$ must be odd.\nIf at least one $a_i$ is odd, then $a_i^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, and the coefficient vector $(a_1^2 \\pmod{2}, \\dots, a_s^2 \\pmod{2})$ is not the zero vector.\nThus, for any given solution $\\mathbf{a}$ modulo $2^t$ and any value of $k$, the lifting equation for $\\mathbf{b}$ is a non-trivial linear congruence. It will always have exactly $2^{s-1}$ solutions.\n\nThis means that every solution $\\mathbf{a}$ modulo $2^t$ lifts to exactly $2^{s-1}$ solutions modulo $2^{t+1}$. This holds for all $t \\ge 1$. We can therefore write the recurrence relation:\n$$\nN_{2^{t+1}}(n) = 2^{s-1} N_{2^t}(n) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 1.\n$$\nUnwinding this recurrence, we find\n$$\nN_{2^t}(n) = (2^{s-1})^{t-1} N_2(n) = (2^{s-1})^{t-1} (2^{s-1}) = (2^{s-1})^t = 2^{t(s-1)}.\n$$\nNow we can compute the local density $\\sigma_2(n)$ using its definition:\n$$\n\\sigma_{2}(n) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} 2^{-t(s-1)} \\, N_{2^{t}}(n) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} 2^{-t(s-1)} \\cdot 2^{t(s-1)} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} 1 = 1.\n$$\nThe exact value of the local factor is $1$.\n\nRegarding its influence on the singular series $\\mathfrak{S}(n) = \\prod_p \\sigma_p(n)$, each factor $\\sigma_p(n)$ measures the $p$-adic density of solutions. If any factor $\\sigma_p(n)$ were zero, it would imply a local obstruction to integer solutions (i.e., the congruence $F(\\mathbf{x}) \\equiv n \\pmod{p^t}$ is unsolvable for some $t$), and the singular series would vanish. A positive singular series is a necessary condition for the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic formula to predict a non-zero number of integer solutions.\nThe value $\\sigma_2(n)=1$ is positive, confirming there is no obstruction at the prime $2$. A factor of $1$ is neutral; it does not augment or diminish the magnitude of $\\mathfrak{S}(n)$. It indicates that, from the perspective of prime $2$, the density of solutions is what one might naively expect on average.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3091484"}]}
