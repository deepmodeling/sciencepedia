Therefore, we can proceed to the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Solution**\n\nThe solution will be constructed by following the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Verification of the $abc$ triple**\n\nWe are given the triple $(a,b,c)$ with $a=1$, $b=8$, and $c=9$. To be an $abc$ triple, it must satisfy two conditions.\n\nFirst, the sum condition $a+b=c$ must hold.\n$$1 + 8 = 9$$\nThis condition is satisfied.\n\nSecond, the integers must be pairwise coprime, meaning $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, $\\gcd(a,c)=1$, and $\\gcd(b,c)=1$. We test each pair:\n- $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(1,8)$. The greatest common divisor of $1$ and any other integer is $1$. So, $\\gcd(1,8)=1$.\n- $\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(1,9)$. Similarly, the greatest common divisor is $1$. So, $\\gcd(1,9)=1$.\n- $\\gcd(b,c) = \\gcd(8,9)$. To find this, we examine the prime factorizations of $8$ and $9$. The prime factorization of $8$ is $2^3$. The prime factorization of $9$ is $3^2$. Since there are no common prime factors, the greatest common divisor is $1$. So, $\\gcd(8,9)=1$.\n\nSince both the sum condition and the pairwise coprime condition are met, the triple $(1, 8, 9)$ is confirmed to be an $abc$ triple.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the radical**\n\nThe radical, $\\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. We need to compute $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)$.\nFirst, we calculate the product $abc$:\n$$abc = 1 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 = 72$$\nNext, we find the prime factorization of $72$:\n$$72 = 8 \\cdot 9 = (2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2) \\cdot (3 \\cdot 3) = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$$\nThe distinct prime factors of $72$ are $2$ and $3$.\nAccording to the definition, the radical of $72$ is the product of these distinct prime factors:\n$$\\operatorname{rad}(72) = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$$\nThus, for the triple $(1, 8, 9)$, we have $\\operatorname{rad}(abc) = 6$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the quality**\n\nThe quality of the triple is defined as $q(a,b, c) = \\frac{\\ln(c)}{\\ln(\\operatorname{rad}(abc))}$.\nUsing the values $c=9$ and $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)=6$, we can compute the quality:\n$$q(1, 8, 9) = \\frac{\\ln(9)}{\\ln(6)}$$\nWe can express the logarithms in terms of logarithms of prime numbers to see the structure more clearly:\n$$\\ln(9) = \\ln(3^2) = 2\\ln(3)$$\n$$\\ln(6) = \\ln(2 \\cdot 3) = \\ln(2) + \\ln(3)$$\nSo, the quality is:\n$$q(1, 8, 9) = \\frac{2\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2) + \\ln(3)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value. Using standard values for the natural logarithms:\n$\\ln(9) \\approx 2.197224577$\n$\\ln(6) \\approx 1.791759469$\n$$q(1, 8, 9) \\approx \\frac{2.197224577}{1.791759469} \\approx 1.22629478$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1.226$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe final numerical value for the quality is $1.226$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.226}\n$$", "id": "3090088"}, {"introduction": "With the basic definitions in hand, we can now explore the heart of the $abc$ conjecture: the existence of 'exceptional' triples.

It poses a clear computational task rooted in established number theory. We may, therefore, proceed to construct a solution.\n\nThe solution is implemented by structuring the program into two primary phases: a precomputation phase for calculating radicals efficiently, followed by a main phase for enumerating triples and aggregating the specified metrics.\n\n### Phase 1: Precomputation of Radicals\n\nThe radical of a positive integer $n$, denoted $\\mathrm{rad}(n)$, is the product of its distinct prime factors. For a positive integer $n$ with prime factorization $n=\\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{\\alpha_i}$, the radical is $\\mathrm{rad}(n)=\\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i$.\n\nThe problem requires enumerating triples $(a,b,c)$ where $c \\le c_{\\max}$, with the highest bound being $c_{\\max}=1000$. This implies that the integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ will not exceed $1000$. A direct, on-the-fly prime factorization to compute $\\mathrm{rad}(a)$, $\\mathrm{rad}(b)$, and $\\mathrm{rad}(c)$ for each triple would be computationally redundant. A more efficient strategy is to precompute and cache the radical for every integer $n$ in the range $[1, 1000]$.\n\nThis precomputation is accomplished in two steps:\n1.  **Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) Sieve**: We first use a sieve algorithm, similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to populate an array, `spf`, where `spf[n]` stores the smallest prime factor of $n$. This is done by iterating from $p=2$ up to $\\sqrt{1000}$. For each prime $p$, we iterate through its multiples $j$ and set `spf[j]`$=p$ if its smallest prime factor has not yet been determined. This populates the `spf` array for all integers up to $1000$ in approximately $O(c_{\\max} \\log \\log c_{\\max})$ time.\n2.  **Radical Computation**: With the `spf` array, we can compute the radical of each integer $n$ efficiently. We create a `rad_values` array where `rad_values[n]` stores $\\mathrm{rad}(n)$. We establish the base case $\\mathrm{rad}(1)=1$. For any integer $n>1$, we can find its radical using the following recurrence relation based on its smallest prime factor $p = \\mathrm{spf}[n]$ and the integer $m=n/p$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{rad}(n) = \\begin{cases} \\mathrm{rad}(m) & \\text{if } \\mathrm{rad}(m) \\text{ is divisible by } p \\\\ p \\cdot \\mathrm{rad}(m) & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n    This allows for a single, efficient pass from $n=2$ to $1000$ to compute and store all necessary radical values.\n\n### Phase 2: Enumeration and Metric Aggregation\n\nThe core of the problem involves enumerating triples and calculating metrics for the test suite of bounds $c_{\\max} \\in \\{3, 10, 30, 1000\\}$. To avoid redundant computations, we employ a cumulative aggregation strategy. We perform a single enumeration pass from $c=3$ to $1000$, maintaining running totals for the required metrics. When the iteration variable $c$ reaches one of the specified bounds, we record the current state of these metrics.\n\nThe enumeration and aggregation algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize cumulative metric counters: `total_triples_count`$=0$, `q_gt_1_count`$=0$, and `max_q`$=0.0$.\n2.  Iterate $c$ from $3$ to $1000$.\n3.  For each $c$, iterate $a$ from $1$ to $c-1$, as specified by the problem. Let $b=c-a$. Note that since $c \\ge 3$, $a$ and $b$ are always positive.\n4.  A triple $(a,b,c)$ is included if it is coprime. The problem correctly states that for $a+b=c$, the condition $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ is sufficient to ensure that $a,b,c$ are pairwise coprime, and thus $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$. We use a standard Euclidean algorithm for the GCD check.\n5.  If $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, we have found a valid triple. We update `total_triples_count`.\n6.  The quality of the triple is given by $q(a,b,c)=\\dfrac{\\log c}{\\log \\mathrm{rad}(abc)}$, where $\\log$ is the natural logarithm. Because $a,b,c$ are pairwise coprime, the radical is multiplicative: $\\mathrm{rad}(abc) = \\mathrm{rad}(a)\\mathrm{rad}(b)\\mathrm{rad}(c)$. The individual radical values are retrieved from our precomputed `rad_values` array. The denominator is never zero, as $c \\ge 3$ implies $\\mathrm{rad}(abc) > 1$.\n7.  We compare the computed quality $q$ to $1$. If $q>1$, we increment `q_gt_1_count`. We also update `max_q = \\max(max\\_q, q)`.\n8.  After completing the inner loop for a given $c$, we check if $c$ matches one of the specified bounds $\\{3, 10, 30, 1000\\}$. If it does, we store the current values of `total_triples_count`, `q_gt_1_count`, and `max_q` as the result for that bound.\n9.  After the loops complete, the collected metrics for each bound are formatted. The maximum quality value for each bound is rounded to six decimal places. The final list of results is then converted to the precisely specified string format. For any bound where no triples are found, the count metrics would be $0$ and `max_q` would remain at its initial value of $0.0$, fulfilling the problem's requirement.\n\nThis principled approach ensures correctness by adhering to the foundational definitions of number theory and efficiency through precomputation and a cumulative aggregation strategy.", "answer": "```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerates coprime triples (a,b,c) with a+b=c, computes their quality q,\n    and aggregates metrics for specified bounds on c, following the problem's\n    definitions and algorithmic requirements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_bounds = [3, 10, 30, 1000]\n    c_max_global = max(test_bounds)\n\n    # --- Phase 1: Precomputation of Radicals ---\n    \n    # Precompute smallest prime factors (SPF) using a sieve.\n    # spf[i] stores the smallest prime factor of integer i.\n    spf = list(range(c_max_global + 1))\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(c_max_global)) + 1):\n        if spf[i] == i:  # i is a prime\n            # Mark multiples of i.\n            for j in range(i * i, c_max_global + 1, i):\n                if spf[j] == j:  # Only update if not already updated by a smaller prime.\n                    spf[j] = i\n\n    # Precompute radicals for all numbers up to c_max_global.\n    # rad_values[n] stores the radical of n, which is the product of its distinct prime factors.\n    rad_values = [0] * (c_max_global + 1)\n    rad_values[1] = 1\n    for n in range(2, c_max_global + 1):\n        p = spf[n]\n        m = n // p\n        # Use a dynamic programming relation: rad(n) is related to rad(n/p).\n        # If p is already a factor of rad(m), then rad(n) = rad(m).\n        # Otherwise, rad(n) = rad(m) * p.\n        if rad_values[m] % p == 0:\n            rad_values[n] = rad_values[m]\n        else:\n            rad_values[n] = rad_values[m] * p\n\n    # --- Phase 2: Enumeration and Aggregation ---\n\n    # Dictionary to store final results for each test bound.\n    metrics = {}\n    \n    # Cumulative metrics updated as we iterate through c.\n    total_triples_count = 0\n    q_gt_1_count = 0\n    max_q = 0.0\n\n    # Use an iterator to track which test bound we are aiming for next.\n    test_bounds_iter = iter(sorted(test_bounds))\n    next_bound = next(test_bounds_iter, None)\n\n    # Main enumeration loop over c.\n    for c in range(3, c_max_global + 1):\n        # Per problem specification, iterate a from 1 to c-1.\n        # This counts (a,b,c) and (b,a,c) as distinct triples if a != b.\n        for a in range(1, c):\n            b = c - a\n            \n            # Condition for a valid coprime triple: gcd(a,b) = 1.\n            if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:\n                total_triples_count += 1\n                \n                # For pairwise coprime a,b,c, rad(abc) = rad(a)rad(b)rad(c).\n                rad_abc = rad_values[a] * rad_values[b] * rad_values[c]\n                \n                # Quality q = log(c) / log(rad(abc)).\n                # rad_abc > 1 is guaranteed for c >= 3.\n                q = math.log(c) / math.log(rad_abc)\n                \n                if q > 1:\n                    q_gt_1_count += 1\n                \n                if q > max_q:\n                    max_q = q\n        \n        # If the current c matches a test bound, store the cumulative metrics.\n        if c == next_bound:\n            metrics[c] = [total_triples_count, q_gt_1_count, max_q]\n            next_bound = next(test_bounds_iter, None)\n            if next_bound is None:\n                # All bounds have been processed, we can exit early.\n                break\n\n    # --- Final Output Formatting ---\n    \n    final_results_list = []\n    for bound in test_bounds:\n        if bound in metrics:\n            N, K, Q = metrics[bound]\n            Q_rounded = round(Q, 6)\n            final_results_list.append([N, K, Q_rounded])\n        else:\n            # This case handles bounds not reached by the loop (e.g., < 3).\n            # The problem's rule: if no triples are found, metrics are 0.\n            final_results_list.append([0, 0, 0.0])\n\n    # Print the results in the exact specified format: [[...],[...],...]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, final_results_list))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3090061"}]}
