The construction of the field of $p$-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ begins from the $p$-adic valuation on $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (unique prime factorization), any non-zero rational number $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ can be written uniquely as $x = p^{k}\\dfrac{a}{b}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$, and neither $a$ nor $b$ divisible by $p$.

The $p$-adic valuation, denoted $v_p(x)$, for a non-zero rational number $x$, is defined based on the unique prime factorization of $x$. Any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ can be written as $x = p^k \\frac{a}{b}$, where $p$ is a prime, $k$ is an integer, and $a, b$ are integers not divisible by $p$. The $p$-adic valuation of $x$ is then $v_p(x) = k$.\n\nLet's compute each valuation as requested.\n\n1. Calculation of $v_{3}(90)$:\nThe number is $x=90$ and the prime is $p=3$. We determine the prime factorization of $90$:\n$$90 = 9 \\times 10 = 3^2 \\times 2 \\times 5$$\nWe must express $90$ in the canonical form $p^k \\frac{a}{b}$. For $p=3$, we group the factor of $3$:\n$$90 = 3^2 \\times (2 \\times 5) = 3^2 \\times 10$$\nThis can be written as $3^2 \\times \\frac{10}{1}$. Comparing this to the form $p^k \\frac{a}{b}$, we have $p=3$, $k=2$, $a=10$, and $b=1$. The conditions are met as $p=3$ does not divide $a=10$ and $p=3$ does not divide $b=1$.\nThus, by definition, the $3$-adic valuation is:\n$$v_{3}(90) = 2$$\n**Interpretation**: The valuation $v_{3}(90) = 2$ is a positive integer. For an integer argument, a positive valuation of magnitude $k$ signifies that the integer is divisible by $p^k$ but not by $p^{k+1}$. In this case, $90$ is divisible by $3^2=9$ (as $90 = 9 \\times 10$), but not by $3^3=27$. The sign (positive) reflects that the powers of the prime $p=3$ appear in the numerator (as $90 = \\frac{90}{1}$).\n\n2. Calculation of $v_{5}\\!\\left(\\dfrac{75}{2}\\right)$:\nThe number is $x=\\frac{75}{2}$ and the prime is $p=5$. We find the prime factorizations of the numerator and the denominator:\nNumerator: $75 = 3 \\times 25 = 3 \\times 5^2$.\nDenominator: $2 = 2^1$.\nSo, the rational number is $x = \\frac{3 \\times 5^2}{2}$.\nTo match the form $p^k \\frac{a}{b}$ with $p=5$, we isolate the power of $5$:\n$$x = 5^2 \\times \\frac{3}{2}$$\nHere, we identify $k=2$, $a=3$, and $b=2$. The conditions are satisfied because $p=5$ does not divide $a=3$ and $p=5$ does not divide $b=2$.\nTherefore, the $5$-adic valuation is:\n$$v_{5}\\!\\left(\\frac{75}{2}\\right) = 2$$\n**Interpretation**: The valuation $v_{5}(\\frac{75}{2}) = 2$ is positive. For a rational number, this indicates that the power of $p$ in the prime factorization of the numerator is greater than that in the denominator. Here, the exponent of $5$ in the numerator $75$ is $2$, and the exponent of $5$ in the denominator $2$ is $0$. The valuation is the difference of these exponents, $2-0=2$. The positive sign shows that the number's \"p-adic size\" is determined by the numerator's divisibility by $p$.\n\n3. Calculation of $v_{2}\\!\\left(\\left(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\right)^{3}\\right)$:\nThe number is $x=\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3$ and the prime is $p=2$. We first simplify the expression for $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{3^3}{4^3} = \\frac{27}{(2^2)^3} = \\frac{27}{2^6}$$\nTo express this in the form $p^k \\frac{a}{b}$ for $p=2$, we write:\n$$x = 2^{-6} \\times 27 = 2^{-6} \\times \\frac{27}{1}$$\nWe identify $k=-6$, $a=27$, and $b=1$. The conditions are met because $p=2$ does not divide $a=27$ and $p=2$ does not divide $b=1$.\nThus, the $2$-adic valuation is:\n$$v_{2}\\!\\left(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{3}\\right) = -6$$\n**Interpretation**: The valuation $v_{2}((\\frac{3}{4})^3) = -6$ is negative. This indicates that the power of $p$ in the prime factorization of the denominator is greater than that in the numerator. The exponent of $2$ in the numerator $27$ is $0$, while the exponent of $2$ in the denominator $64$ is $6$. The valuation is the difference $0-6=-6$. The negative sign reflects that the number possesses a high power of $p$ in its denominator. The magnitude $6$ quantifies this \"p-adic largeness\".\n\nIn summary, the computed valuations are $v_{3}(90)=2$, $v_{5}(75/2)=2$, and $v_{2}((3/4)^{3})=-6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2  2  -6 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3083821"}, {"introduction": "The $p$-adic metric, derived from the valuation, introduces a notion of distance that radically differs from our everyday experience with real numbers.

The sequence does not converge to $0$ with respect to the usual real metric, which is based on the standard absolute value $|\\cdot|$.\n\nLet us define convergence in each context. A sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $0$ in a metric space with metric $d$ if, for every real number $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n  N$, we have $d(x_n, 0)  \\epsilon$.\n\nFor the $p$-adic metric, this means $|x_n - 0|_p = |x_n|_p \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Given the definition $|x_n|_p = p^{-v_p(x_n)}$ for $x_n \\neq 0$, the condition $|x_n|_p \\to 0$ is equivalent to the condition that the $p$-adic valuation $v_p(x_n)$ must tend to $\\infty$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor the usual real metric, non-convergence to $0$ means that the statement $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |x_n| = 0$ is false.

Each $x_n$ is an integer, and therefore a rational number, so $(x_n) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe will now verify that this sequence satisfies both required properties, using only the definitions provided.\n\n**1. Convergence to $0$ in the $p$-adic Metric**\n\nWe must show that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |x_n|_p = 0$.\nThe term of our sequence is $x_n = p^n$. To calculate $|p^n|_p$, we first determine its $p$-adic valuation, $v_p(p^n)$.\nAccording to the definition of the $p$-adic valuation, we must write $x_n$ in the form $p^k \\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers not divisible by $p$.\nWe can write $p^n$ as $p^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{1}$. In this representation, we have $k=n$, $a=1$, and $b=1$.\nSince $p$ is a prime number, its smallest value is $2$. Thus, $p$ does not divide $1$. The conditions $p \\nmid a$ and $p \\nmid b$ are satisfied.\nTherefore, from the definition of the $p$-adic valuation, we have:\n$$v_p(x_n) = v_p(p^n) = n$$\nNow, we use the definition of the $p$-adic absolute value:\n$$|x_n|_p = |p^n|_p = p^{-v_p(p^n)} = p^{-n}$$\nTo prove that $|x_n|_p \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$, we must show that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n  N$, $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$.\nLet $\\epsilon  0$ be given. The inequality $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$ is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{p^n}  \\epsilon$, which implies $p^n  \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides (which is a strictly increasing function), we get:\n$$\\ln(p^n)  \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\n$$n \\ln(p)  -\\ln(\\epsilon)$$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, $p \\ge 2$, and thus $\\ln(p)  \\ln(1) = 0$. We can divide by $\\ln(p)$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$n  -\\frac{\\ln(\\epsilon)}{\\ln(p)}$$\nWe can therefore choose $N = \\left\\lfloor \\max\\left(0, -\\frac{\\ln(\\epsilon)}{\\ln(p)}\\right) \\right\\rfloor$. For any integer $n  N$, the condition $|x_n|_p  \\epsilon$ will be satisfied.\nThis completes the proof that the sequence $(x_n = p^n)$ converges to $0$ with respect to the $p$-adic metric.\n\n**2. Non-convergence to $0$ in the Real Metric**\n\nWe must show that the sequence $(x_n = p^n)$ does not converge to $0$ with respect to the usual real absolute value $|\\cdot|$.\nThe real absolute value of a term in our sequence is:\n$$|x_n| = |p^n|$$\nSince $p$ is a positive integer, $|p^n| = p^n$.\nTo show non-convergence to $0$, we must find an $\\epsilon_0  0$ such that for any integer $N$, there exists an $n  N$ with $|x_n| \\ge \\epsilon_0$.\nLet us choose $\\epsilon_0 = 1$.\nThe prime $p$ satisfies $p \\ge 2$. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, we have:\n$$|x_n| = p^n \\ge 2^n \\ge 2^1 = 2$$\nThus, for all $n \\ge 1$, we have $|x_n| \\ge 2  1 = \\epsilon_0$. This condition holds for all $n$, so it certainly holds for some $n  N$ regardless of our choice of $N$.\nTherefore, the sequence $(x_n)$ does not converge to $0$ in the real metric. In fact, since $p \\ge 2$, the sequence $(p^n)$ is strictly increasing and diverges to $\\infty$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a sequence $x_n = p^n$ and rigorously justified, based on the provided definitions, that it converges to $0$ in the $p$-adic metric while not converging to $0$ (and in fact, diverging) in the real metric.
