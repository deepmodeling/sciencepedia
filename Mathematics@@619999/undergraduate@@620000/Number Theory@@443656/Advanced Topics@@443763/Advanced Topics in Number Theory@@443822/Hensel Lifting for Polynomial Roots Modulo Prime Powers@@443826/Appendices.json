The solution is to be constructed by analyzing the congruence starting from the prime base $p=5$, in accordance with the principles of lifting solutions from modulo $p$ to modulo $p^{k}$.\n\nLet the polynomial be $f(x) = x^{2} - 2$. We are seeking solutions to $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^{6}}$.\nA fundamental principle of modular arithmetic states that if a congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ has a solution, and $d$ is a divisor of $n$, then the congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d}$ must also have a solution.\nIn our case, $n=5^{6}$ and we can choose the divisor $d=5$. Therefore, a necessary condition for a solution to exist for $x^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5^{6}}$ is that a solution must exist for the congruence $x^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nWe investigate the existence of solutions to $x^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. This is equivalent to asking whether $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$. We can determine this by computing the squares of all possible residues in the ring of integers modulo $5$, which are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe squares are:\n$0^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$\n$1^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n$2^{2} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$3^{2} \\equiv 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$4^{2} \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nThe set of quadratic residues modulo $5$ is the set of values obtained, which is $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$. The value $2$ is not an element of this set. Therefore, $2$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $5$.\nThis demonstrates that the congruence $x^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ has no solutions.\n\nSince the necessary condition for the existence of a solution to the original congruence is not met, we can conclude that the congruence $x^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5^{6}}$ has no solutions. If there were an integer $x_{0}$ such that $x_{0}^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5^{6}}$, it would imply $x_{0}^{2} = 2 + k \\cdot 5^{6}$ for some integer $k$. This would in turn imply $x_{0}^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, which we have shown to be impossible.\n\nThe problem statement asks us to consider the process of lifting. The procedure for lifting a solution, commonly known as Hensel's Lemma, begins with a solution $r_{1}$ to the congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. This initial solution is then \"lifted\" to a solution modulo $p^{2}$, then to $p^{3}$, and so on, up to the desired power $p^{k}$. In our case, $p=5$ and $k=6$. The very first step of this procedure requires a solution to $x^{2} - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. As we have demonstrated, no such solution exists. Consequently, the lifting process cannot be initiated. The failure to find a root at the prime base level is the rigorous reason why no solution exists for any higher power of that prime.\n\nThe problem defines a quantity $S$ as the sum of the least nonnegative residues of all solutions modulo $5^{6}$. Since we have proven that there are no solutions to the congruence $x^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5^{6}}$, the set of solutions is empty.

The base root is $a_1 = 1$. We have $f(1) = 1^3-1=0$, which is congruent to $0 \\pmod 7$. The formal derivative of the polynomial is $f'(x)=3x^2$. We evaluate the derivative at our root modulo $p=7$:\n$$ f'(1) = 3(1)^2 = 3 $$\nSince $f'(1) = 3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$, the root $a_1=1$ is a simple root. Hensel's Lemma guarantees that this root can be lifted uniquely to any higher power of $7$.\n\n**Step 1: Lifting from modulo $7$ to modulo $7^2=49$.**\nWe seek a root $a_2$ modulo $49$ of the form $a_2 = a_1 + 7k = 1 + 7k$, where $k$ is an integer in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 6\\}$.

The congruence simplifies to:\n$$ 21k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49} $$\nThis is a linear congruence. We can divide the entire congruence (including the modulus) by their greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(21, 49) = 7$:\n$$ 3k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7 $$\nThe coefficient of $k$ is $3$, which is precisely $f'(1)$. Since $f'(1) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$, it is invertible modulo $7$. We can multiply by its inverse (which is $5$, since $3 \\cdot 5 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$) to find a unique solution for $k$:\n$$ 5 \\cdot (3k) \\equiv 5 \\cdot 0 \\pmod 7 \\implies k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7 $$\nThe unique value for $k$ is $k=0$.

We will address each task in sequence.\n\nFirst, we compute the discriminant of $f(x)$ as requested.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^{3}-2$. Its roots are the solutions to $x^3=2$. Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}$ be the real root. The other two roots are complex, given by $\\alpha\\omega$ and $\\alpha\\omega^2$, where $\\omega = \\exp(i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

Let the roots of $f(x)$ be $r_1 = \\alpha$, $r_2 = \\alpha\\omega$, and $r_3 = \\alpha\\omega^2$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the discriminant $\\Delta(f)$ is given by $\\Delta(f)=\\prod_{1 \\leq ij \\leq 3}(r_{i}-r_{j})^{2}$.\nWe calculate the differences between the roots:\n$r_1 - r_2 = \\alpha - \\alpha\\omega = \\alpha(1-\\omega)$\n$r_1 - r_3 = \\alpha - \\alpha\\omega^2 = \\alpha(1-\\omega^2)$\n$r_2 - r_3 = \\alpha\\omega - \\alpha\\omega^2 = \\alpha(\\omega-\\omega^2)$\n\nThe discriminant is the square of the product of these differences:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = [ (r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3) ]^2 $$\nLet's compute the product inside the brackets:\n$$ (r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3) = \\alpha(1-\\omega) \\cdot \\alpha(1-\\omega^2) \\cdot \\alpha(\\omega-\\omega^2) $$\n$$ = \\alpha^3 (1-\\omega)(1-\\omega^2)(\\omega-\\omega^2) $$\nSince $\\alpha^3 = 2$, this simplifies to:\n$$ = 2 (1-\\omega-\\omega^2+\\omega^3)(\\omega-\\omega^2) $$\nUsing the identities $\\omega^3=1$ and $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, which implies $\\omega+\\omega^2=-1$, we have:\n$$ 1-\\omega-\\omega^2 = 1 - (\\omega+\\omega^2) = 1 - (-1) = 2 $$\nFurthermore, we can compute $\\omega-\\omega^2$:\n$$ \\omega-\\omega^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = i\\sqrt{3} $$\nSubstituting these values back into the product:\n$$ (r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3) = 2 \\cdot (2) \\cdot (i\\sqrt{3}) = 6i\\sqrt{3} $$\nFinally, we square this result to obtain the discriminant:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = (6i\\sqrt{3})^2 = 6^2 \\cdot i^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 36 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 3 = -108 $$\nFor a generic cubic polynomial $x^3+px+q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -4p^3-27q^2$. For $f(x)=x^3-2$, we have $p=0$ and $q=-2$. Applying this formula yields $\\Delta = -4(0)^3 - 27(-2)^2 = -27(4) = -108$, which confirms our calculation from first principles.\n\nSecond, we determine for which primes $p$ the reduced polynomial $\\bar{f}(x)=x^{3}-2 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ has a repeated root.\nThe criterion provided is that $\\bar{f}(x)$ has a repeated root if and only if $\\gcd(\\bar{f}, \\bar{f}') \\neq 1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$.\nThe derivative of $f(x)=x^3-2$ is $f'(x)=3x^2$. Thus, in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, we have $\\bar{f}(x) = x^3-2$ and $\\bar{f}'(x) = 3x^2$. The condition for repeated roots is equivalent to the condition that $\\bar{f}$ and $\\bar{f}'$ share a common root in an algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{F}_p$. We analyze this based on the prime $p$.\n\nCase 1: $p=2$.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$, $\\bar{f}(x) = x^3$ and $\\bar{f}'(x) = 3x^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$.\nThe greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(x^3, x^2) = x^2$. Since $x^2 \\neq 1$, $\\bar{f}(x)$ has a repeated root modulo $2$. The root is $x=0$.\n\nCase 2: $p=3$.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$, $\\bar{f}(x) = x^3 - 2 \\equiv x^3 + 1 \\pmod 3$.\nThe derivative is $\\bar{f}'(x) = 3x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\nThe greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(x^3-2, 0) = x^3-2$. Since this is not a constant polynomial (i.e., not $1$), $\\bar{f}(x)$ has a repeated root modulo $3$. Factoring $\\bar{f}(x)$ reveals the nature of the roots: $x^3+1 = (x+1)^3$ in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$, so $x=-1 \\equiv 2$ is a root of multiplicity $3$.\n\nCase 3: $p > 3$.\nIn this case, $3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$.\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^3-2$ and $\\bar{f}'(x) = 3x^2$.\nThe only root of $\\bar{f}'(x)=3x^2$ in any extension of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is $x=0$, since $3$ is invertible modulo $p$.\nFor $\\bar{f}$ and $\\bar{f}'$ to have a common root, this root must be $x=0$. We check if $x=0$ is a root of $\\bar{f}(x)$.\n$\\bar{f}(0) = 0^3-2 = -2$.\nFor $x=0$ to be a root, we would need $-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, which implies $p$ divides $2$. The only prime for which this is true is $p=2$, but we are in the case $p > 3$. Thus, for $p>3$, $\\bar{f}(0) \\neq 0$.\nSo, for $p > 3$, $\\bar{f}(x)$ and $\\bar{f}'(x)$ have no common roots, which means $\\gcd(\\bar{f}, \\bar{f}') = 1$. Therefore, $\\bar{f}(x)$ has no repeated roots for $p>3$.\n\nIn summary, $\\bar{f}(x)=x^3-2$ has a repeated root modulo $p$ if and only if $p=2$ or $p=3$. These are precisely the prime factors of the discriminant $\\Delta(f)=-108=-2^2 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\nThird, we explain how the presence of repeated roots affects root lifting and verify for $p=2$ and $p=3$.\nA root $a_0$ of $f(x)$ modulo $p$ is a value such that $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. We seek a root modulo $p^2$ of the form $a_1 = a_0+tp$ for some integer $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$. Using a Taylor expansion modulo $p^2$:\n$$ f(a_1) = f(a_0+tp) \\equiv f(a_0) + f'(a_0)tp \\pmod{p^2} $$\nSince $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, we can write $f(a_0) = cp$ for some integer $c$. Substituting this into the congruence, we need to solve for $t$:\n$$ cp + f'(a_0)tp \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2} $$\nDividing by $p$, we obtain a linear congruence for $t$:\n$$ c + t f'(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p \\implies t f'(a_0) \\equiv -c \\pmod p $$\nwhere $c = f(a_0)/p$.\n\nIf $\\bar{f}'(a_0) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ (a simple or non-singular root), then $f'(a_0)$ has a unique inverse modulo $p$, and there is a unique solution for $t$: $t \\equiv -c \\cdot (f'(a_0))^{-1} \\pmod p$. The root $a_0$ lifts uniquely to a root modulo $p^2$. This is the case covered by the simple form of Hensel's lemma provided.\n\nIf $\\bar{f}'(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ (a multiple or singular root), the congruence becomes $0 \\equiv -c \\pmod p$, or $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. This condition is equivalent to $f(a_0)/p \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, which means $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$.\n- If $f(a_0) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$, then $c \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. The congruence has no solution for $t$, so the root $a_0$ does not lift to any root modulo $p^2$.\n- If $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$, then $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. The congruence becomes $0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, which is true for all $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$. In this case, $a_0$ lifts to $p$ distinct roots modulo $p^2$, namely $a_0, a_0+p, \\dots, a_0+(p-1)p$.\n\nWe now apply this analysis to $f(x)=x^3-2$ for $p=2$ and $p=3$.\n\nVerification for $p=2$:\nThe polynomial is $\\bar{f}(x) = x^3 \\pmod 2$. The only root in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is $a_0=0$.\nThe derivative is $\\bar{f}'(x)=x^2 \\pmod 2$. At the root, $\\bar{f}'(0)=0^2=0$, so this is a singular root.\nWe check the lifting condition for singular roots: does $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod {2^2}$?\n$f(0) = 0^3-2 = -2$.\nWe check if $-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. Since $-2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, the condition is not met.\nTherefore, the root $a_0=0$ modulo $2$ does not lift to a root modulo $4$.\nTo verify this conclusion directly, we check for roots of $x^3-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$:\n$0^3-2 = -2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$\n$1^3-2 = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$\n$2^3-2 = 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$\n$3^3-2 = 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$\nThere are no solutions to $x^3-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. This confirms that no root exists modulo $4$.\n\nVerification for $p=3$:\nThe polynomial is $\\bar{f}(x) = x^3-2 \\equiv x^3+1 \\pmod 3$. As shown before, $\\bar{f}(x)=(x+1)^3$, so the only root in $\\mathbb{F}_3$ is $a_0=-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nThe derivative is $\\bar{f}'(x) = 3x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. At the root, $\\bar{f}'(2)=0$, so this is a singular root.\nWe check the lifting condition for singular roots: does $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^2}$? We use $a_0=2$.\n$f(2) = 2^3-2=6$.\nWe check if $6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$. This is false.\nTherefore, the root $a_0=2$ modulo $3$ does not lift to a root modulo $9$.\nTo verify this conclusion directly, we check for potential roots modulo $9$, which must be of the form $2+3k$: $2, 5, 8$.\nIf $x=2$, $x^3-2 = 2^3-2 = 6 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$.\nIf $x=5$, $x^3-2 = 5^3-2 = 123 = 13 \\cdot 9 + 6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$.\nIf $x=8$, $x^3-2 = 8^3-2 = 510 = 56 \\cdot 9 + 6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$.\nThere are no solutions to $x^3-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$. This confirms that no root exists modulo $9$.\n\nIn both cases where $\\bar{f}(x)$ has a repeated root, the root modulo $p$ does not lift to a root modulo $p^2$. This is a common outcome for singular roots where the multiplicity of the root modulo $p$ is higher than the power of $p$ dividing the value of the polynomial at the root.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-108}$$", "id": "3085978"}]}
