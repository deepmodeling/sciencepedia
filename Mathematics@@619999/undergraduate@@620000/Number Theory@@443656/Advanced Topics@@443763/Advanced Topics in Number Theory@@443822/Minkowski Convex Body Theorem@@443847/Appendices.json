The core of the problem lies in understanding the relationship between two different basis matrices, $B$ and $B'$, that generate the same lattice $L$.\n\nLet $B$ and $B'$ be two $n \\times n$ matrices whose columns form bases for a lattice $L$. The condition that they generate the same lattice is $L(B) = L(B')$, where $L(B) = \\{Bz : z \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$ and $L(B') = \\{B'z' : z' \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between $B$ and $B'$ from first principles.\n\n1.  Assume $L(B) = L(B')$. Since the columns of $B'$, denoted $b'_1, \\dots, b'_n$, are elements of $L(B')$, they must also be elements of $L(B)$. This means that for each column $b'_j$, there exists an integer vector $u_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $b'_j = B u_j$. Let $U$ be the matrix whose columns are $u_1, \\dots, u_n$. By this construction, $U$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with integer entries. The relationship can be expressed in matrix form as $B' = BU$.\n\n2.  By the same logic, since the columns of $B$, denoted $b_1, \\dots, b_n$, are in $L(B)$, they must also be in $L(B')$. Thus, for each column $b_i$, there exists an integer vector $v_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $b_i = B' v_i$. Let $V$ be the matrix with columns $v_1, \\dots, v_n$. $V$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with integer entries, and we have $B = B'V$.\n\n3.  Now, we can combine these two matrix equations. Substituting $B' = BU$ into $B = B'V$ gives $B = (BU)V = B(UV)$. Since the columns of $B$ form a basis, they are linearly independent, which implies that the matrix $B$ is invertible. We can multiply by $B^{-1}$ on the left to get $I = UV$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\n4.  We have established that $U$ and $V=U^{-1}$ are both matrices with integer entries. A square matrix with integer entries has an inverse with integer entries if and only if its determinant is $\\pm 1$. Such matrices form the General Linear Group over the integers, $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, the change-of-basis matrix $U$ must be in $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n5.  Conversely, assume $B' = BU$ for some $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$. We need to show that $L(B') = L(B)$.\n    - Let $x \\in L(B')$. Then $x = B'z'$ for some $z' \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Substituting $B' = BU$, we get $x = (BU)z' = B(Uz')$. Since $U$ and $z'$ have integer entries, their product $z = Uz'$ is also an integer vector, $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Thus $x = Bz$, which means $x \\in L(B)$. So, $L(B') \\subseteq L(B)$.\n    - Let $y \\in L(B)$. Then $y = Bz$ for some $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Since $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$, its inverse $U^{-1}$ exists and also has integer entries. From $B' = BU$, we can write $B = B'U^{-1}$. Substituting this, we get $y = (B'U^{-1})z = B'(U^{-1}z)$. Since $U^{-1}$ and $z$ have integer entries, their product $z' = U^{-1}z$ is an integer vector, $z' \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Thus $y = B'z'$, which means $y \\in L(B')$. So, $L(B) \\subseteq L(B')$.\n    - Since we have containment in both directions, $L(B) = L(B')$.\n\nWith this fundamental relationship established, we can now evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. If $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$, then $B' = BU$ generates the same lattice as $B$, and conversely, if $L(B') = L(B)$, then there exists $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$ such that $B' = BU$.**\nThis statement precisely matches the conclusion of our derivation. The first part (\"if\") corresponds to our step 5, and the second part (\"conversely\") corresponds to our steps 1-4. Both directions are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\det(U) = \\pm 1$, then $B' = BU$ necessarily generates the same lattice as $B$.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it weakens the condition on $U$ from being in $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$ to being in $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ with determinant $\\pm 1$. The crucial property is that $U$ must have integer entries to ensure that the set of points generated remains the same. If $U$ has non-integer entries, $B' = BU$ will generally produce a different lattice. For example, let $n=2$ and $B=I$, so $L(B) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. Let $U = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix}$. We have $\\det(U) = 1$, so $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$. Then $B' = BU = U$. The lattice $L(B')$ is $\\{ (z_1/2, 2z_2) : z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$. This lattice contains the point $(1/2, 0)$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Thus, $L(B') \\neq L(B)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The covolume $\\det(L)$ is invariant under replacing $B$ by $BU$ for any $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$.**\nThe covolume of the lattice is defined as $\\det(L) = |\\det(B)|$. Let $B'$ be another basis for the same lattice. From A, we know $B' = BU$ for some $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$. The covolume computed with $B'$ is $|\\det(B')|$. Using the properties of determinants, we have $|\\det(B')| = |\\det(BU)| = |\\det(B)\\det(U)| = |\\det(B)||\\det(U)|$. By definition of $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$, any matrix $U$ in this group has $\\det(U) = \\pm 1$, which means $|\\det(U)| = 1$. Therefore, $|\\det(B')| = |\\det(B)| \\times 1 = |\\det(B)|$. The covolume is indeed independent of the choice of basis, which validates the notation $\\det(L)$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The quantity $2^n \\det(L)$ and the formulation of Minkowski's convex body theorem are invariant under replacing a basis matrix $B$ of $L$ by $BU$ for any $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$.**\nMinkowski's theorem states that for a lattice $L$, any centrally symmetric convex body $S$ with volume $\\mathrm{vol}(S)  2^n \\det(L)$ contains a non-zero point of $L$.\nFirst, the quantity $2^n \\det(L)$. As shown in C, $\\det(L)$ is invariant under a change of basis $B' = BU$ where $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $n$ is the fixed dimension of the space, the quantity $2^n \\det(L)$ is also invariant.\nSecond, the formulation of the theorem. The theorem is a statement about the geometric objects $L$ (the lattice as a set of points) and $S$ (the convex body), and the relationship between their \"sizes\" ($\\det(L)$ and $\\mathrm{vol}(S)$). As established in A, changing the basis from $B$ to $B' = BU$ with $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$ does not change the lattice $L$. As established in C, it does not change the value of $\\det(L)$. Therefore, the entire premise and conclusion of Minkowski's theorem remain unchanged. The theorem is a basis-independent property of the lattice itself.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. A lattice basis is unique up to multiplying each basis vector by the same nonzero real scalar; that is, any other basis of the same lattice is of the form $B' = cB$ with $c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.**\nThis statement proposes that the change-of-basis matrix is always of the form $U = cI$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. For $B'$ and $B$ to generate the same lattice, we must have $U = cI \\in \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$. For the matrix $cI$ to have integer entries, $c$ must be an integer. For it to be in $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$, its determinant must be $\\pm 1$. The determinant is $\\det(cI) = c^n$. So we must have $c^n = \\pm 1$ for an integer $c$. This only allows $c=1$ and $c=-1$. The statement's claim that $c$ can be any non-zero real number is false. Furthermore, not all change-of-basis matrices are scalar multiples of the identity. For $n=2$, $L=\\mathbb{Z}^2$, $B=I$. The matrix $U=\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\subset \\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The basis $B' = BU = U$ also generates $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, but $B'$ is not a scalar multiple of $B$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. If two bases $B$ and $B'$ generate the same lattice, then there exists $U \\in \\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$ such that $B' = BU$.**\nThis statement is a stronger version of the correct characterization from A. It claims the change-of-basis matrix $U$ must have determinant $+1$ (i.e., be in $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$), not just $\\pm 1$. This is false.\nConsider $n=2$, $L=\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and basis $B = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let's choose another basis $B' = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The columns of $B'$ are $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, which are a valid basis for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Thus $L(B) = L(B')$. The change-of-basis matrix is $U = B^{-1}B' = I^{-1}B' = B' = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix $U$ has integer entries and its determinant is $\\det(U) = 0 \\times 0 - 1 \\times 1 = -1$. So, $U \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, but $U \\notin \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This provides a counterexample. Any transformation involving a reflection (which flips the orientation of the basis) will have a determinant of $-1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3087197"}, {"introduction": "With a solid understanding of the lattice determinant, we can now put Minkowski's theorem into practice.

If, in addition, $K$ is assumed centrally symmetric about the origin, then the proof proceeds to show $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point.**\n\n-   **Example of failure:** The set $K=B_R(u)$ is a ball of radius $R$ centered at $u$. For any $u \\neq 0$, it is not origin-symmetric. It is convex. We choose $R$ such that its volume is greater than $2^n$. The pigeonhole step provides a non-zero lattice point $v = (k_1-k_2)/2$ where $k_1, k_2 \\in B_R(u)$. The difference $k_1-k_2$ lies in the set $K-K = B_R(u) - B_R(u) = B_{2R}(0)$.

The vector $v = (k_1-k_2)/2$ is not a convex combination of $k_1$ and $k_2$ (the coefficients $1/2$ and $-1/2$ do not sum to $1$). The counterexample from option A demonstrates this, where for the convex set $K=B_3((10,0))$, the lattice point $v=(3,0)$ found via the pigeonhole argument is not in $K$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Take $K = B_R(u)$ as in option A. The pigeonhole step provides $x,y \\in K/2$ with $x - y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, and assuming only that $K$ is centrally symmetric about some point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ (with no restriction on $c$) is enough to guarantee that $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point whenever $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$.**\n\n-   **Claim:** Central symmetry about an arbitrary point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a sufficient condition.\n-   **Analysis:** Let $K$ be convex and symmetric about $c$. The proof that relies on Blichfeldt's principle gives us $v=(k_1-k_2)/2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ for some $k_1, k_2 \\in K$. Since $k_2 \\in K$, symmetry about $c$ implies that $2c-k_2 \\in K$. By convexity, the midpoint of $k_1$ and $2c-k_2$ is in $K$: $\\frac{1}{2}(k_1 + (2c-k_2)) = \\frac{k_1-k_2}{2} + c = v+c \\in K$. So we have shown that the point $v+c$ is in $K$. However, since $c$ can be any point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $v+c$ is not guaranteed to be a lattice point. For example, if $v=(1,0,...,0)$ and $c=(1/2, 0, ..., 0)$, then $v+c=(3/2,0,...,0)$ is not in $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Therefore, this condition does not guarantee that $K$ contains a lattice point.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Take $K$ to be a large-volume simplex... The pigeonhole step provides $x,y \\in K/2$ with $x - y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, and requiring only that $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ suffices to conclude that $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point whenever $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$.**\n\n-   **Claim:** The condition $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ is sufficient.\n-   **Analysis:** If $K$ is convex and contains $0$ in its interior, one might try to apply Minkowski's theorem to the set $K' = K \\cap (-K)$. This set $K'$ is convex and origin-symmetric. However, there is no guarantee that $\\operatorname{vol}(K')  2^n$ just because $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$. Consider a convex set elongated in one direction, for example, $K = [- \\epsilon, M] \\times [-1, 1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $M$ be large and $\\epsilon$ be small. We can choose $M$ and $\\epsilon$ such that $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ and $\\operatorname{vol}(K) = (M+\\epsilon) \\times 2  2^2=4$. The set $-K = [-M, \\epsilon] \\times [-1, 1]$. The intersection is $K' = K \\cap (-K) = [-\\epsilon, \\epsilon] \\times [-1, 1]$, which has volume $2\\epsilon \\times 2 = 4\\epsilon$. We can make this volume less than $4$ by choosing a sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, for example $\\epsilon=0.1$. The argument fails. The condition $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ is not sufficient.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Take $K$ as in option A to illustrate the failure... A sufficient additional hypothesis that restores the conclusion is that $K$ is centrally symmetric about a lattice point $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ (equivalently, $K - c$ is origin-symmetric). Under this hypothesis, whenever $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$, the set $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point.**\n\n-   **Example of failure:** Same as in A, which is a valid illustration.\n-   **Restoring Hypothesis:** The condition is that $K$ is convex, $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$, and $K$ is centrally symmetric about a lattice point $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Let's test this.\n    There are two ways to prove this.\n    1.  *Via translation:* Let $K' = K-c = \\{k-c : k \\in K\\}$. Since $K$ is symmetric about $c$, $K'$ is symmetric about the origin. $K'$ is also convex. Its volume is $\\operatorname{vol}(K') = \\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$. By the standard Minkowski theorem (as in option A), $K'$ must contain a non-zero lattice point $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The existence of such a $v \\in K'$ means $v=k-c$ for some $k \\in K$. This implies $k = v+c$. Since $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, their sum $k$ is also a lattice point in $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. So we have found a lattice point $k \\in K$.\n        Is it non-zero? If $k \\neq 0$, we are done. If $k=0$, then $v+c=0$, so $v=-c$. Since $v \\neq 0$, $c$ must be a non-zero lattice point. In this case, we have $0 \\in K$. By symmetry of $K$ about $c$, the point $2c-0=2c$ must also be in $K$. As $c$ is a non-zero lattice point, $2c$ is a non-zero lattice point. In all cases, $K$ contains a non-zero lattice point.\n    2.  *Following the pigeonhole argument:* The argument leading to $v+c \\in K$ from option C is valid. Here, since $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, the point $v+c$ is a lattice point contained in $K$. The same argument as above shows that this guarantees a non-zero lattice point in $K$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "3087174"}]}
