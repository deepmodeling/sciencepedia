Provide your final answer in exact form without rounding.", "solution": "The foundational definitions required are those of the $p$-adic valuation and the $p$-adic absolute value on the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. For a prime number $p$, the $p$-adic valuation of a non-zero integer $n$, denoted $v_p(n)$, is the exponent of the highest power of $p$ that divides $n$. That is, if $n = p^k m$ where $p$ does not divide $m$, then $v_p(n) = k$. For a rational number $x = \\frac{a}{b}$ with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $b \\neq 0$, the valuation is defined as $v_p(x) = v_p(a) - v_p(b)$. By convention, $v_p(0) = \\infty$.\n\nThe non-archimedean absolute value associated with the prime $p$, denoted $|\\cdot|_p$, is defined for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ as:\n$$|x|_p = \\begin{cases} p^{-v_p(x)}  \\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x = 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to evaluate $|1-9|_3$. First, we compute the argument of the absolute value: $1 - 9 = -8$. The task is therefore to find the value of $|-8|_3$.\n\nAccording to the definition, $|-8|_3 = 3^{-v_3(-8)}$. We must determine the $3$-adic valuation of $-8$, which is $v_3(-8)$. The prime factorization of $-8$ is $-1 \\cdot 2^3$. The prime $3$ does not appear in this factorization, which means the highest power of $3$ that divides $-8$ is $3^0$. Therefore, the $3$-adic valuation is:\n$$v_3(-8) = 0$$\nSubstituting this value back into the definition of the absolute value, we get:\n$$|1-9|_3 = |-8|_3 = 3^{-v_3(-8)} = 3^{-0} = 1$$\n\nNext, we must justify whether the strong triangle property (also known as the ultrametric inequality) attains equality in this case. The strong triangle inequality for a non-archimedean absolute value states that for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$|x+y|_p \\le \\max(|x|_p, |y|_p)$$\nThis also applies to differences, since $|-y|_p = |y|_p$:\n$$|x-y|_p \\le \\max(|x|_p, |y|_p)$$\nA key property is that equality holds, i.e., $|x \\pm y|_p = \\max(|x|_p, |y|_p)$, if and only if $|x|_p \\neq |y|_p$.\n\nWe apply this to our expression $|1-9|_3$ by setting $x=1$ and $y=9$. We need to compute their respective $3$-adic absolute values and compare them.\n\nFor $x=1$:\nThe $3$-adic valuation is $v_3(1) = 0$, since $1=3^0 \\cdot 1$.\nThe $3$-adic absolute value is $|1|_3 = 3^{-v_3(1)} = 3^{-0} = 1$.\n\nFor $y=9$:\nThe prime factorization is $9=3^2$. The $3$-adic valuation is $v_3(9) = 2$.\nThe $3$-adic absolute value is $|9|_3 = 3^{-v_3(9)} = 3^{-2} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nComparing the two absolute values, we find that $|1|_3 = 1$ and $|9|_3 = \\frac{1}{9}$. Since $1 \\neq \\frac{1}{9}$, the condition $|x|_p \\neq |y|_p$ is satisfied. Consequently, the strong triangle inequality must hold with equality:\n$$|1-9|_3 = \\max(|1|_3, |9|_3) = \\max\\left(1, \\frac{1}{9}\\right) = 1$$\nThis result is consistent with our direct calculation of $|1-9|_3 = 1$. Thus, the strong triangle property does attain equality.\n\nFinally, we are asked to indicate how this decision is determined by the valuation of $8$. The condition for equality in the strong triangle inequality can also be expressed in terms of valuations. The property $v_p(x \\pm y) \\ge \\min(v_p(x), v_p(y))$ holds in general. The equality $|x \\pm y|_p = \\max(|x|_p, |y|_p)$ is equivalent to the valuation equality $v_p(x \\pm y) = \\min(v_p(x), v_p(y))$, which holds if and only if $v_p(x) \\neq v_p(y)$.\n\nIn our case, $v_3(1)=0$ and $v_3(9)=2$. Since $0 \\neq 2$, the equality rule predicts that the valuation of the difference must be the minimum of the individual valuations:\n$$v_3(1-9) = \\min(v_3(1), v_3(9)) = \\min(0, 2) = 0$$\nThe difference is $1-9 = -8$. The problem references the valuation of $8$. Since for any non-archimedean valuation $v_p(-z)=v_p(z)$, we have $v_3(-8) = v_3(8)$. The valuation of the difference is thus $v_3(8)$. Our prediction from the equality rule is that $v_3(8)$ must be $0$. A direct calculation of $v_3(8)$ confirms this: $8 = 3^0 \\cdot 8$, so $v_3(8)=0$. The fact that the directly calculated valuation of the difference, $v_3(8)=0$, exactly matches the value predicted by the equality condition, $\\min(v_3(1), v_3(9))=0$, confirms that equality in the strong triangle inequality is attained. The valuation of $8$ serves as a verification of the principle.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3087817"}, {"introduction": "One of the most profound consequences of the $p$-adic absolute value is its impact on the concept of convergence, which is the foundation of analysis.

This analysis involves two parts: determining if the series converges, and if so, calculating its sum. The solution must be constructed using only the four foundational facts provided.\n\nFirst, we determine if the series converges. A series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n$ converges in a complete metric space if and only if its sequence of partial sums, $S_N = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n$, is a Cauchy sequence. By Fact (iii), $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is the completion of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to $|\\cdot|_p$, and is therefore a complete metric space. The terms of our series, $p^n$, are elements of $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the partial sums $S_N$ are also in $\\mathbb{Q}$. We must test if the sequence $(S_N)_{N \\ge 0}$ is a Cauchy sequence in the metric $|\\cdot|_p$.\n\nA sequence $(S_N)$ is Cauchy if for any real number $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N_0$ such that for all integers $M  N  N_0$, we have $|S_M - S_N|_p  \\epsilon$.\n\nLet's compute the term $|S_M - S_N|_p$ for $M  N$. The partial sums are $S_N = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^n$.\nTheir difference is:\n$$S_M - S_N = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{M} p^n\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^n\\right) = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{M} p^n = p^{N+1} + p^{N+2} + \\dots + p^M$$\nNow, we apply the $p$-adic absolute value. Using the non-Archimedean (ultrametric) triangle inequality from Fact (ii), which states $|x+y|_p \\leq \\max\\{|x|_p, |y|_p\\}$, we can extend this by induction to a finite sum:\n$$|S_M - S_N|_p = |p^{N+1} + p^{N+2} + \\dots + p^M|_p \\leq \\max\\{|p^{N+1}|_p, |p^{N+2}|_p, \\dots, |p^M|_p\\}$$\nNext, we evaluate $|p^k|_p$ for an integer $k \\ge 0$. Using Fact (i), we can write $p^k$ as $p^k \\frac{a}{b}$ with $a=1$ and $b=1$. Since $p$ is a prime, it does not divide $1$. Thus, the definition applies with the exponent of $p$ being $k$. This gives:\n$$|p^k|_p = p^{-k}$$\nSubstituting this into our inequality:\n$$|S_M - S_N|_p \\leq \\max\\{p^{-(N+1)}, p^{-(N+2)}, \\dots, p^{-M}\\}$$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, $p \\ge 2$. Therefore, the function $f(k) = p^{-k}$ is a strictly decreasing function of the integer $k$. The maximum value in the set $\\{p^{-(N+1)}, p^{-(N+2)}, \\dots, p^{-M}\\}$ is attained at the smallest exponent, which is $N+1$.\n$$|S_M - S_N|_p \\leq p^{-(N+1)}$$\nNow we can show that $(S_N)$ is a Cauchy sequence. For any given $\\epsilon  0$, we need to find an $N_0$ such that for all $N  N_0$, $p^{-(N+1)}  \\epsilon$. This inequality is equivalent to $p^{N+1}  1/\\epsilon$. Taking the natural logarithm, we get $(N+1)\\ln(p)  \\ln(1/\\epsilon)$, which means $N+1  \\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{\\ln(p)}$. We can always choose an integer $N_0$ that is greater than $\\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{\\ln(p)} - 1$. Then, for any $M  N  N_0$, we have $|S_M - S_N|_p \\leq p^{-(N+1)}  p^{-(N_0+1)}  \\epsilon$.\nThis confirms that the sequence of partial sums $(S_N)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{Q}, |\\cdot|_p)$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is the completion of $\\mathbb{Q}$ (Fact iii), this Cauchy sequence must converge to a limit in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. Therefore, the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{n}$ converges in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nHaving established convergence, we now compute the sum. Let $S = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{n}$. By definition, this sum is the limit of the sequence of partial sums:\n$$S = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} S_N = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^n$$\nWe use Fact (iv), the algebraic identity for a finite geometric sum. Since $p$ is a prime, $p \\neq 1$, so the formula applies:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^n = \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nThe sum $S$ is the limit of this expression as $N \\to \\infty$. Since addition, subtraction, and division by a non-zero number are continuous operations in the field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, we can compute the limit as:\n$$S = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1 - p} = \\frac{\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p^{N+1})}{\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p)} = \\frac{1 - \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nWe need to evaluate $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1}$. A sequence $(x_k)$ converges to $0$ in a metric space if and only if the sequence of real numbers $|x_k|$ converges to $0$. We have already established that $|p^{k}|_p = p^{-k}$. Thus, we examine the limit:\n$$\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} |p^{N+1}|_p = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{-(N+1)}$$\nSince $p \\ge 2$, the base of the exponentiation $p$ is greater than $1$, so the limit of $p^{-(N+1)}$ as $N \\to \\infty$ is $0$.\nThis means $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1} = 0$ in the $p$-adic metric.\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 - p} = \\frac{1}{1 - p}$$\nThe sum is the rational number $\\frac{1}{1-p}$, which is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and therefore an element of its completion $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nThus, the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^n$ converges in $(\\mathbb{Q}_p, |\\cdot|_p)$, and its sum is $\\frac{1}{1-p}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-p}}$$", "id": "3087829"}]}
