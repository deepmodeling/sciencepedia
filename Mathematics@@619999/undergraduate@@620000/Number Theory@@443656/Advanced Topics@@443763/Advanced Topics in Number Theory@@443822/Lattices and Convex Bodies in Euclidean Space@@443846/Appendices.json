We shall proceed with the solution by addressing each required part in sequence.\n\nThe lattice $L$ is defined as the set of all integer linear combinations of the basis vectors $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$. Let us denote the lattice generated by a set of basis vectors $S$ as $\\mathcal{L}(S)$. Thus, the given lattice is $L = \\mathcal{L}(\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}) = \\{ k_1 b_1 + k_2 b_2 + k_3 b_3 \\mid k_1, k_2, k_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$. We are asked to show that the set of vectors $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$ also forms a basis for this same lattice $L$.\n\nFirst, we will show that the lattice generated by $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$, which we denote as $L_C = \\mathcal{L}(\\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\})$, is a subset of $L$. This requires expressing each vector $c_i$ as an integer linear combination of the vectors $b_j$. Using the provided definitions:\n$c_1 = b_1 = 1 \\cdot b_1 + 0 \\cdot b_2 + 0 \\cdot b_3$\n$c_2 = b_1 + b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1 + 1 \\cdot b_2 + 0 \\cdot b_3$\n$c_3 = b_2 - b_3 = 0 \\cdot b_1 + 1 \\cdot b_2 - 1 \\cdot b_3$\nSince each $c_i$ is an element of $L$ (as it is an integer linear combination of the $b_j$), any integer linear combination of the $c_i$ vectors must also be in $L$. That is, for any integers $j_1, j_2, j_3$, the vector $v = j_1 c_1 + j_2 c_2 + j_3 c_3$ is an integer linear combination of integer linear combinations of the $b_j$, which simplifies to an integer linear combination of the $b_j$. Therefore, $L_C \\subseteq L$.\n\nSecond, to establish that a set of vectors generates the *same* lattice, we must also show the reverse inclusion, $L \\subseteq L_C$. This requires expressing each of the original basis vectors $b_j$ as an integer linear combination of the new vectors $c_i$. We can rearrange the definitions of $c_i$ to solve for $b_j$:\nFrom $c_1 = b_1$, we have $b_1 = c_1$.\nFrom $c_2 = b_1 + b_2$, we substitute $b_1=c_1$ to get $c_2 = c_1 + b_2$, which yields $b_2 = c_2 - c_1$.\nFrom $c_3 = b_2 - b_3$, we substitute $b_2 = c_2 - c_1$ to get $c_3 = (c_2 - c_1) - b_3$, which yields $b_3 = c_2 - c_1 - c_3$.\nWriting these out explicitly as integer linear combinations:\n$b_1 = 1 \\cdot c_1 + 0 \\cdot c_2 + 0 \\cdot c_3$\n$b_2 = -1 \\cdot c_1 + 1 \\cdot c_2 + 0 \\cdot c_3$\n$b_3 = -1 \\cdot c_1 + 1 \\cdot c_2 - 1 \\cdot c_3$\nSince each $b_j$ is an element of $L_C$, any integer linear combination of the $b_j$ must also be in $L_C$. Thus, $L \\subseteq L_C$.\nHaving shown both $L_C \\subseteq L$ and $L \\subseteq L_C$, we conclude that $L = L_C$. The sets $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$ and $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$ are two different bases for the same lattice $L$.\n\nNext, we compute the determinants of the basis matrices $B$ and $C$. The matrix $B$ is given by the column vectors $b_1, b_2, b_3$:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  0 \\\\ 1  2  1 \\\\ 0  1  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of $B$ is:\n$$\n\\det(B) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{vmatrix} + 0 = 2(2 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 1(1 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 0) = 2(3) - 1(2) = 6 - 2 = 4\n$$\nNow we construct the matrix $C$ from its column vectors $c_1, c_2, c_3$:\n$c_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $c_2 = b_1 + b_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $c_3 = b_2 - b_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nSo, the matrix $C$ is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  3  1 \\\\ 1  3  1 \\\\ 0  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of $C$ is:\n$$\n\\det(C) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 3  1 \\\\ 1  -1 \\end{vmatrix} - 3 \\begin{vmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{vmatrix} + 1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1  3 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{vmatrix} = 2(3(-1) - 1(1)) - 3(1(-1) - 1(0)) + 1(1(1) - 3(0))\n$$\n$$\n\\det(C) = 2(-4) - 3(-1) + 1(1) = -8 + 3 + 1 = -4\n$$\nWe observe that $|\\det(B)| = |4| = 4$ and $|\\det(C)| = |-4| = 4$. Their absolute values are equal. This result is expected. The volume of the fundamental parallelepiped of a lattice, which is a convex body, is a geometric invariant of the lattice itself, independent of the choice of basis. This volume is given by the absolute value of the determinant of any basis matrix for the lattice. Since we have demonstrated that $\\{b_i\\}$ and $\\{c_i\\}$ are both bases for the same lattice $L$, the volumes of their respective fundamental parallelepipeds must be equal. Therefore, $|\\det(B)| = |\\det(C)|$.\n\nNow we find the change-of-basis matrix $U$ such that $C = BU$. The columns of $U$ are the coordinate vectors of the new basis vectors $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$ with respect to the old basis $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$. From our initial analysis:\n$c_1 = 1 \\cdot b_1 + 0 \\cdot b_2 + 0 \\cdot b_3$\n$c_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1 + 1 \\cdot b_2 + 0 \\cdot b_3$\n$c_3 = 0 \\cdot b_1 + 1 \\cdot b_2 - 1 \\cdot b_3$\nThe columns of $U$ are the coefficient vectors of these combinations:\n$$\nU = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix $U$ is an integer matrix which transforms the basis $B$ to the basis $C$.\n\nFinally, we compute the determinant of $U$. As $U$ is an upper triangular matrix, its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\det(U) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the property $\\det(C) = \\det(BU) = \\det(B)\\det(U)$. Using our computed values, we have $-4 = 4 \\cdot \\det(U)$, which gives $\\det(U) = -1$. A change-of-basis matrix for a lattice must be a unimodular matrix, meaning it is an integer matrix with a determinant of either $1$ or $-1$.

Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem consists of three parts. We will address them in order.\n\n**1. Derivation of a basis matrix for the dual lattice $L^{\\ast}$**\n\nLet $L$ be a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ generated by the columns of an invertible $n \\times n$ matrix $B$. This means $L = \\{ Bv : v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n} \\}$. The problem sets $n=3$, but the derivation is general. The dual lattice $L^{\\ast}$ is defined as:\n$$\nL^{\\ast} \\;=\\; \\{\\, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\;:\\; y \\cdot x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ for all } x \\in L \\,\\}\n$$\nThe condition is that for any $y \\in L^{\\ast}$ and any $x \\in L$, their inner product is an integer. Since any $x \\in L$ can be written as $x = Bv$ for some integer vector $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, the condition becomes:\n$$\ny \\cdot (Bv) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the standard inner product $a \\cdot b = a^T b$, we can rewrite the condition in matrix form:\n$$\n(Bv)^T y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nUsing the property of matrix transposes $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$, this becomes:\n$$\nv^T B^T y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\n$$\nThis expression is the standard dot product in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ between the vector $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ and the vector $B^T y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. For this dot product to be an integer for all integer vectors $v$, we can test it with the standard basis vectors $v = e_i$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots, n$, where $e_i$ is the vector with a $1$ in the $i$-th position and $0$s elsewhere. For $v=e_i$, the condition is:\n$$\ne_i^T (B^T y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThe product $e_i^T (B^T y)$ simply selects the $i$-th component of the vector $B^T y$. Thus, for the condition to hold for all $e_i$, every component of the vector $B^T y$ must be an integer. This means the vector $B^T y$ must belong to the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$:\n$$\nB^T y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\n$$\nConversely, if $B^T y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, then for any $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, the dot product $v^T(B^T y)$ is a sum of products of integers, which is always an integer. Therefore, the condition $B^T y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is equivalent to the defining condition for $y \\in L^{\\ast}$.\n\nTo find the structure of $L^{\\ast}$, we solve for $y$. Since $L$ is a full-rank lattice, its basis matrix $B$ is invertible. This implies that $B^T$ is also invertible. We can write:\n$$\ny = (B^T)^{-1} k\n$$\nfor some integer vector $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$.

Using properties of determinants:\n$$\n\\det(B^{\\ast}) = \\det((B^T)^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\det(B^T)}\n$$\nSince the determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose, $\\det(B^T) = \\det(B) = 30$.

A key property of lattices is that the dual of the dual lattice is the original lattice, i.e., $(L^{\\ast})^{\\ast} = L$. We can apply the Poisson summation formula to the lattice $L^{\\ast}$ and a function $g$:\n$$\n\\sum_{y \\in L^{\\ast}} g(y) = \\frac{1}{\\det(L^{\\ast})} \\sum_{x \\in (L^{\\ast})^{\\ast}} \\hat{g}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\det(L^{\\ast})} \\sum_{x \\in L} \\hat{g}(x)\n$$\nIf we choose $g = \\hat{f}$, the Fourier inversion theorem implies $\\hat{g}(x) = \\hat{\\hat{f}}(x) = f(-x)$ (with the appropriate normalization for the Fourier transform). Substituting this into the second formula gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{y \\in L^{\\ast}} \\hat{f}(y) = \\frac{1}{\\det(L^{\\ast})} \\sum_{x \\in L} f(-x)\n$$\nSince $L$ is a lattice, it is centrally symmetric, meaning that if $x \\in L$, then $-x \\in L$. Thus, summing $f(-x)$ over all $x \\in L$ is the same as summing $f(x)$ over all $x \\in L$.\n$$\n\\sum_{y \\in L^{\\ast}} \\hat{f}(y) = \\frac{1}{\\det(L^{\\ast})} \\sum_{x \\in L} f(x)\n$$\nNow, we can rearrange the original Poisson summation formula to get:\n$$\n\\sum_{y \\in L^{\\ast}} \\hat{f}(y) = \\det(L) \\sum_{x \\in L} f(x)\n$$\nComparing the two expressions for $\\sum_{y \\in L^{\\ast}} \\hat{f}(y)$, we see that for these equations to hold for arbitrary suitable functions $f$, we must have:\n$$\n\\det(L) = \\frac{1}{\\det(L^{\\ast})} \\implies \\det(L) \\det(L^{\\ast}) = 1\n$$\nThis fundamental relationship is a condition for the self-consistency of the Poisson summation formula on lattices.
