I will address each part of the problem in sequence.\n\n### Part 1: Dimension of $M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$\n\nThe dimension of the space of modular forms $M_{k}(\\Gamma_{0}(N))$ for weight $k \\ge 2$ can be determined using a standard formula that depends on the genus of the modular curve $X_{0}(N)$ and the number of cusps. For the special case of weight $k=2$, the formula is:\n$$\n\\dim M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(N)) = g + \\nu_{\\infty} - 1\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the genus of $X_{0}(N)$ and $\\nu_{\\infty}$ is the number of cusps for $\\Gamma_{0}(N)$. This formula is valid when $N>1$ and there exists at least one regular cusp other than $\\infty$, which holds for $\\Gamma_0(11)$. The genus $g$ is given by the formula:\n$$\ng = 1 + \\frac{\\mu_{N}}{12} - \\frac{\\nu_{2}}{4} - \\frac{\\nu_{3}}{3} - \\frac{\\nu_{\\infty}}{2}\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_{N} = [\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_{0}(N)]$ is the index of the congruence subgroup, $\\nu_{2}$ is the number of elliptic points of order $2$, and $\\nu_{3}$ is the number of elliptic points of order $3$.\n\nWe need to compute these quantities for $N=11$.\n1.  **Index $\\mu_{11}$**: For a prime number $p$, the index is given by $\\mu_{p} = p+1$. For $N=11$, we have $\\mu_{11} = 11+1 = 12$.\n2.  **Elliptic Points $\\nu_{2}, \\nu_{3}$**: For a prime $N \\ge 5$, the group $\\Gamma_{0}(N)$ has no elliptic points. This is a standard result. The problem statement also directs us to use the absence of elliptic fixed points. Thus, for $N=11$, we have $\\nu_{2}=0$ and $\\nu_{3}=0$.\n3.  **Cusps $\\nu_{\\infty}$**: For a prime number $p$, the group $\\Gamma_{0}(p)$ has exactly two cusps, which can be represented by $\\infty$ and $0$. Therefore, for $N=11$, we have $\\nu_{\\infty}=2$.\n\nNow we can compute the genus of $X_{0}(11)$:\n$$\ng = 1 + \\frac{12}{12} - \\frac{0}{4} - \\frac{0}{3} - \\frac{2}{2} = 1 + 1 - 0 - 0 - 1 = 1\n$$\nWith the genus $g=1$ and the number of cusps $\\nu_{\\infty}=2$, we can find the dimension of $M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$:\n$$\n\\dim M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11)) = g + \\nu_{\\infty} - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n$$\nThus, the space of weight $2$ modular forms for $\\Gamma_{0}(11)$ is two-dimensional.\n\n### Part 2: Construction of an Eisenstein Series\n\nWe are asked to construct an Eisenstein series in $M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$ using the quasi-modular Eisenstein series $E_{2}(z)$. The Fourier expansion of $E_{2}(z)$ is given by:\n$$\nE_{2}(z) = 1 - 24 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{1}(n) q^{n}, \\quad \\text{where } \\sigma_{1}(n) = \\sum_{d|n, d>0} d \\text{ and } q=\\exp(2\\pi i z)\n$$\n$E_{2}(z)$ is not a modular form for $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$; its transformation under $\\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is given by:\n$$\nE_{2}(\\gamma z) = (cz+d)^{2} E_{2}(z) + \\frac{12c}{2\\pi i}(cz+d)\n$$\nWe want to find a linear combination of functions of the form $E_{2}(hz)$ that is modular for $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_{0}(11)$. For $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_{0}(11)$, we have $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, so $c = 11k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nLet's examine the transformation of $f(z) = E_{2}(11z)$. For $\\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\Gamma_{0}(11)$, we have:\n$$\nf(\\gamma z) = E_{2}(11\\gamma z) = E_{2}\\left(11 \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\\right) = E_{2}\\left(\\frac{a(11z) + 11b}{(c/11)(11z) + d}\\right)\n$$\nLet $z' = 11z$ and $\\gamma' = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 11b \\\\ c/11 & d \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $c$ is a multiple of $11$, $c/11$ is an integer. The determinant of $\\gamma'$ is $ad - (11b)(c/11) = ad - bc = 1$, so $\\gamma' \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$. We apply the transformation law to $E_{2}(z')$ with matrix $\\gamma'$:\n$$\nE_{2}(\\gamma' z') = ((c/11)z' + d)^{2} E_{2}(z') + \\frac{12(c/11)}{2\\pi i}((c/11)z' + d)\n$$\nSubstituting $z'=11z$ back gives:\n$$\nE_{2}(11\\gamma z) = (cz+d)^{2} E_{2}(11z) + \\frac{12c}{11 \\cdot 2\\pi i}(cz+d)\n$$\nNow, consider the linear combination $G(z) = E_{2}(z) - 11E_{2}(11z)$. Its transformation is:\n\\begin{align*}\nG(\\gamma z) &= E_{2}(\\gamma z) - 11 E_{2}(11\\gamma z) \\\\\n&= \\left((cz+d)^{2} E_{2}(z) + \\frac{12c}{2\\pi i}(cz+d)\\right) - 11\\left((cz+d)^{2} E_{2}(11z) + \\frac{12c}{11 \\cdot 2\\pi i}(cz+d)\\right) \\\\\n&= (cz+d)^{2} (E_{2}(z) - 11E_{2}(11z)) + \\left(\\frac{12c}{2\\pi i}(cz+d) - \\frac{11 \\cdot 12c}{11 \\cdot 2\\pi i}(cz+d)\\right) \\\\\n&= (cz+d)^{2} G(z) + 0\n\\end{align*}\nThe non-modular terms cancel. The function $G(z)$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{H}$ and at the cusps because it has a Fourier expansion at each cusp (a property of this construction). Thus, $G(z)=E_{2}(z)-11E_{2}(11z)$ is a weight $2$ modular form for $\\Gamma_{0}(11)$. It is an Eisenstein series because its constant term is non-zero.\n\nThe space of Eisenstein series of weight $2$ for $\\Gamma_{0}(11)$ with trivial character has dimension $\\dim E_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11)) = \\nu_{\\infty}-1 = 2-1=1$. Since we have constructed one non-zero such series, $G(z)$, it must form a basis for this space. Any other weight $2$ Eisenstein series for $\\Gamma_{0}(11)$ with trivial character must be a scalar multiple of $G(z)$.\n\n### Part 3: Basis of $M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$\n\nWe have the decomposition $M_{k}(\\Gamma_0(N)) = S_{k}(\\Gamma_0(N)) \\oplus E_{k}(\\Gamma_0(N))$, where $S_k$ is the space of cusp forms and $E_k$ is the space of Eisenstein series. The dimensions add up: $\\dim M_k = \\dim S_k + \\dim E_k$.\n\nFor $k=2$ and $N=11$:\n-   $\\dim M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11)) = 2$ (from Part 1).\n-   $\\dim E_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11)) = 1$ (from Part 2).\nTherefore, the dimension of the space of cusp forms is $\\dim S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11)) = 2-1=1$.\n\nA one-dimensional space of cusp forms is spanned by a single Hecke eigenform. This eigenform can be normalized to have its first Fourier coefficient $a_{1}=1$. This specifies a unique cusp form, which we denote by $f_{11}(z) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} a_{n}q^{n}$ with $a_{1}=1$.\n\nOur basis for $M_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$ consists of one basis element for the space of Eisenstein series and one for the space of cusp forms. We can choose:\n1.  The Eisenstein series $G(z) = E_{2}(z) - 11E_{2}(11z)$ constructed in Part 2.\n2.  The unique normalized cusp form $f_{11}(z) \\in S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$.\n\nThese two forms are linearly independent, and since the space is two-dimensional, they form a basis.\n\n### Part 4: Fourier Expansion and Final Answer\n\nThe problem asks for the Fourier expansion of \"your Eisenstein basis element\" up to the $q^{12}$ term, and particularly for the coefficient of $q^{11}$. The element constructed is $G(z) = E_{2}(z) - 11E_{2}(11z)$.\n\nThe Fourier expansion of $E_{2}(z)$ is $1 - 24 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{1}(n)q^{n}$.\nThe Fourier expansion of $E_{2}(11z)$ is obtained by substituting $z \\mapsto 11z$, which corresponds to $q \\mapsto q^{11}$.

A cusp of $X_0(N)$ is a $\\Gamma_0(N)$-equivalence class in $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{Q})$. Working from the definition of cusps and the standard classification that every cusp can be represented by a reduced fraction $a/c$ with $c \\mid N$, and that for fixed $c \\mid N$ the number of $\\Gamma_0(N)$-inequivalent such representatives is controlled by the units modulo $\\gcd(c, N/c)$, derive a multiplicative expression for the number of cusps of $X_0(N)$ in terms of the prime power factorization of $N$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for four main components:\n1.  A derivation of a multiplicative expression for the number of cusps of the modular curve $X_0(N)$.\n2.  The computation of this number for $N=432$.\n3.  An interpretation of this number in relation to the space of Eisenstein series.\n4.  A structural explanation for the role of cusps and Eisenstein series in the modular proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT).\n\nLet $\\nu_\\infty(N)$ denote the number of cusps of $X_0(N)$. According to the problem statement, the cusps are classified by representatives $a/c$ where $c$ is a positive divisor of $N$ and $\\gcd(a,c)=1$. For a fixed divisor $c$, the number of $\\Gamma_0(N)$-inequivalent cusps is given by the number of units in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/\\gcd(c, N/c)\\mathbb{Z}$. This number is $\\phi(\\gcd(c, N/c))$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function. To find the total number of cusps, we sum over all positive divisors of $N$:\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(N) = \\sum_{c \\mid N} \\phi(\\gcd(c, N/c)) $$\n\nFirst, we show that $\\nu_\\infty(N)$ is a multiplicative function. Let $N = AB$ where $A$ and $B$ are coprime positive integers. Any divisor $c$ of $N$ can be uniquely written as $c = c_A c_B$, where $c_A \\mid A$ and $c_B \\mid B$. With this decomposition, we also have $N/c = (A/c_A)(B/c_B)$. Since $\\gcd(A,B)=1$, it follows that any prime factor of $c_A$ or $A/c_A$ is a prime factor of $A$, and any prime factor of $c_B$ or $B/c_B$ is a prime factor of $B$. Therefore, $\\gcd(c_A, B/c_B) = \\gcd(A/c_A, c_B) = 1$. This allows us to separate the greatest common divisor:\n$$ \\gcd(c, N/c) = \\gcd(c_A c_B, (A/c_A)(B/c_B)) = \\gcd(c_A, A/c_A) \\gcd(c_B, B/c_B) $$\nSince $\\phi$ is a multiplicative function and the two factors in the argument are coprime, we have:\n$$ \\phi(\\gcd(c, N/c)) = \\phi(\\gcd(c_A, A/c_A)) \\phi(\\gcd(c_B, B/c_B)) $$\nSumming over all divisors $c$ of $N$ is equivalent to summing over all pairs of divisors $(c_A, c_B)$ where $c_A \\mid A$ and $c_B \\mid B$:\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(N) = \\sum_{c_A \\mid A} \\sum_{c_B \\mid B} \\phi(\\gcd(c_A, A/c_A)) \\phi(\\gcd(c_B, B/c_B)) = \\left(\\sum_{c_A \\mid A} \\phi(\\gcd(c_A, A/c_A))\\right) \\left(\\sum_{c_B \\mid B} \\phi(\\gcd(c_B, B/c_B))\\right) $$\nThis shows that $\\nu_\\infty(N) = \\nu_\\infty(A)\\nu_\\infty(B)$, so $\\nu_\\infty$ is a multiplicative function.\n\nTo obtain the general expression, we only need to compute $\\nu_\\infty(p^e)$ for a prime $p$ and an integer $e \\ge 1$. The divisors of $p^e$ are $c_j = p^j$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, e\\}$. For each $j$, we compute $\\phi(\\gcd(p^j, p^{e-j})) = \\phi(p^{\\min(j, e-j)})$.\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(p^e) = \\sum_{j=0}^{e} \\phi(p^{\\min(j, e-j)}) $$\n\nCase 1: The exponent $e$ is even. Let $e = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$.\nThe sum can be written as:\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(p^{2m}) = \\phi(p^0) + \\dots + \\phi(p^{m-1}) + \\phi(p^m) + \\phi(p^{m-1}) + \\dots + \\phi(p^0) = 2\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\phi(p^j) + \\phi(p^m) $$\nUsing the identities $\\phi(1)=1$ and $\\phi(p^j) = p^j - p^{j-1}$ for $j \\ge 1$, the sum $\\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\phi(p^j) = 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (p^j-p^{j-1}) = 1 + (p^k-1) = p^k$.\nSo, $2\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\phi(p^j) = 2p^{m-1}$.\nTherefore, $\\nu_\\infty(p^{2m}) = 2p^{m-1} + \\phi(p^m) = 2p^{m-1} + (p^m - p^{m-1}) = p^m + p^{m-1}$.\n\nCase 2: The exponent $e$ is odd. Let $e = 2m+1$ for some integer $m \\ge 0$.\nThe sum can be written as:\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(p^{2m+1}) = 2\\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\phi(p^j) = 2 p^m $$\nCombining these, the multiplicative expression for $N = \\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i}$ is:\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(N) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\nu_\\infty(p_i^{e_i}) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\nu_\\infty(p^e) = \\begin{cases} p^{e/2} + p^{e/2 - 1} & \\text{if } e \\text{ is even} \\\\ 2p^{(e-1)/2} & \\text{if } e \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases} $$\n\nNext, we compute the number of cusps for $N = 432$. The prime factorization is $432 = 16 \\times 27 = 2^4 \\times 3^3$.\nWe apply the derived formula to each prime power factor:\nFor $p=2$, the exponent is $e=4$, which is even. Here $m=e/2=2$.\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(2^4) = 2^2 + 2^{2-1} = 4 + 2 = 6 $$\nFor $p=3$, the exponent is $e=3$, which is odd. Here $m=(e-1)/2=1$.\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(3^3) = 2 \\times 3^1 = 6 $$\nSince $\\nu_\\infty$ is multiplicative, we have:\n$$ \\nu_\\infty(432) = \\nu_\\infty(2^4) \\nu_\\infty(3^3) = 6 \\times 6 = 36 $$\nThere are $36$ cusps for $X_0(432)$.\n\nThis number has a direct interpretation in the theory of modular forms. The space of weight-$k$ modular forms for $\\Gamma_0(N)$, denoted $M_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$, decomposes as a direct sum of the subspace of cusp forms $S_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$ and the subspace of Eisenstein series $E_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$. For weight $k=2$ and level $N>1$, the dimension of the Eisenstein subspace is given by $\\dim E_2(\\Gamma_0(N)) = \\nu_\\infty(N) - 1$. For $N=432$, the number of cusps being $36$ implies that the dimension of the weight-$2$ Eisenstein subspace $E_2(\\Gamma_0(432))$ is $36-1=35$.\n\nFinally, we address the structural role of cusps and Eisenstein series in the modular approach to Fermat's Last Theorem. The proof, initiated by Frey and completed by Wiles with contributions from Ribet and Taylor, hinges on the modularity of elliptic curves.\n1.  A hypothetical non-trivial integer solution $(A, B, C)$ to $A^p + B^p + C^p = 0$ for a prime $p \\ge 5$ would give rise to a semistable elliptic curve, the Frey curve $E_{A,B,C}$.\n2.  The Modularity Theorem asserts this curve is modular, meaning there exists a weight-$2$ newform $f \\in S_2(\\Gamma_0(N))$ whose Fourier coefficients relate to the number of points on the curve over finite fields. The level $N$ is the conductor of the curve.\n3.  Critically, the Galois representation $\\rho_{E,p}$ attached to the Frey curve is irreducible. This property ensures that the corresponding modular form $f$ must be a cusp form, not an Eisenstein series, as the Galois representations attached to Eisenstein series are reducible. This makes the distinction between the cuspidal subspace $S_2(\\Gamma_0(N))$ and the Eisenstein subspace $E_2(\\Gamma_0(N))$ fundamental.\n4.  Ribet's Level-Lowering Theorem shows that this cusp form $f$ must also exist at the drastically reduced level $N=2$. So, it must be an element of $S_2(\\Gamma_0(2))$.\n5.  The role of cusps becomes explicit here: the dimension of spaces of cusp forms is calculated using formulas that depend on the genus of the modular curve and the number of cusps. For $X_0(2)$, we have $\\nu_\\infty(2)=2$ and genus $g(X_0(2))=0$. The dimension formula for the space of cusp forms then yields $\\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(2)) = 0$. The non-existence of such a cusp form creates a contradiction, proving that the initial hypothetical solution to Fermat's equation cannot exist. The calculation of the number of cusps is therefore an essential step in determining the dimension of the vector space where the modular form is supposed to live.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36}$$", "id": "3083721"}]}
