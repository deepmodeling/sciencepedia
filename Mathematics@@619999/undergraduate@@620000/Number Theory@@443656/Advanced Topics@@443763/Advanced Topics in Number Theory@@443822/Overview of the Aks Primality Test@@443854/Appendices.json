The concepts of perfect powers, primality, and compositeness are fundamental and well-defined.\n- The problem is well-posed. It asks to check a specific property for a specific integer, $n=216$. A solution, whether affirmative or negative, is guaranteed to exist and be unique in its conclusion.\n- The problem is objective and uses precise mathematical language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the task is to determine if $n = 216$ can be expressed as $n = b^{a}$ for integers $b \\ge 2$ and $a \\ge 2$. This is equivalent to finding an integer $a \\ge 2$ such that $b = \\sqrt[a]{n} = \\sqrt[a]{216}$ is an integer greater than or equal to $2$.\n\nTo find such an exponent $a$, we can establish an upper bound for the search. Since $b$ must be at least $2$, we have the inequality:\n$$n = b^{a} \\ge 2^{a}$$\nSubstituting $n = 216$:\n$$216 \\ge 2^{a}$$\nTo find the maximum possible integer value for $a$, we can take the logarithm base $2$ of both sides:\n$$a \\le \\log_{2}(216)$$\nWe know the powers of $2$: $2^{7} = 128$ and $2^{8} = 256$. Since $128  216  256$, it follows that $7  \\log_{2}(216)  8$. Therefore, any integer exponent $a$ must satisfy $a \\le 7$. Since we require $a \\ge 2$, the possible integer values for $a$ we need to test are $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\nWe now test these values for $a$ systematically:\n- For $a=2$: We check if $b = \\sqrt{216}$ is an integer. We know that $14^{2} = 196$ and $15^{2} = 225$. Since $196  216  225$, $\\sqrt{216}$ is not an integer.\n- For $a=3$: We check if $b = \\sqrt[3]{216}$ is an integer. We can test small integers: $5^{3} = 125$ and $6^{3} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\times 6 = 216$. We have found that for $a=3$, $b=6$.\n\nSince we have found the integer pair $(b,a) = (6,3)$ where $b=6 \\ge 2$ and $a=3 \\ge 2$, we have successfully shown that $n = 216$ is a perfect power, as $216 = 6^{3}$. We can stop the search here, as the problem only requires us to find one such pair.\n\nNext, we must explain why the AKS primality test would correctly terminate and classify $n$ as composite at this stage.\n\nBy definition, a number $n > 1$ is composite if it is not prime. A number is prime if its only positive divisors are $1$ and itself. Thus, $n$ is composite if there exists a divisor $d$ of $n$ such that $1  d  n$.\n\nThe first step of the AKS algorithm is to check if the input number $n$ is a perfect power. If $n = b^{a}$ for integers $b \\ge 2$ and $a \\ge 2$, then $b$ is a divisor of $n$. We must verify that $b$ is a non-trivial divisor.\n1. Since $b \\ge 2$, we have $b > 1$.\n2. Since $a \\ge 2$ and $b \\ge 2$, we have $b^{a} > b^{1}$, which means $n > b$.\n\nCombining these, we have $1  b  n$. This shows that $b$ is a divisor of $n$ other than $1$ and $n$. For our specific case, $n = 216$ and $b = 6$. The divisor is $6$, and it satisfies $1  6  216$. The existence of this non-trivial divisor $6$ proves that $216$ is a composite number.\n\nTherefore, upon finding that $n=216$ is a perfect power ($6^3$), the AKS algorithm correctly terminates immediately with the conclusion that $216$ is composite, without needing to proceed to the more computationally intensive steps of the test.\n\nThe explicit integers found are $b=6$ and $a=3$.

This requires computing the binomial coefficients $\\binom{7}{k}$ modulo $7$. The problem directs us to use the basic divisibility property of binomial coefficients modulo a prime. For a prime number $p$, the binomial coefficient $\\binom{p}{k}$ is divisible by $p$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le p-1$. This can be seen from the definition $\\binom{p}{k} = \\frac{p!}{k!(p-k)!}$.
