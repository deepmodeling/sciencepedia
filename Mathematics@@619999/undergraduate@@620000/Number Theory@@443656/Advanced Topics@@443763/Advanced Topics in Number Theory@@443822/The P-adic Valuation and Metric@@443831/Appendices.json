The computation must be based solely on the provided definitions:\n$1$. For a nonzero integer $n$ and a prime $p$, $v_{p}(n)=k$ if and only if $p^{k}$ divides $n$ but $p^{k+1}$ does not divide $n$. Symbolically, $p^{k} \\mid n$ and $p^{k+1} \\nmid n$.\n$2$. For a nonzero rational number $\\frac{a}{b}$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$), the valuation is defined as $v_{p}\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = v_{p}(a) - v_{p}(b)$.\n\nWe are asked to find the ordered pair $(v_{2}(x), v_{3}(x))$. Let us denote the numerator as $a = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}$ and the denominator as $b = 5^{3} \\cdot 2$.\n\nFirst, we compute $v_{2}\\left(\\frac{2^{5}\\cdot 3^{2}}{5^{3}\\cdot 2}\\right)$.\nUsing the definition for rational numbers, we have:\n$$v_{2}\\left(\\frac{2^{5}\\cdot 3^{2}}{5^{3}\\cdot 2}\\right) = v_{2}(2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}) - v_{2}(5^{3} \\cdot 2)$$\n\nLet's evaluate the valuation for the numerator, $v_{2}(2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2})$. Let $n_{1} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2} = 32 \\cdot 9 = 288$. We need to find the largest integer $k$ such that $2^{k} \\mid 288$. The prime factorization of $n_{1}$ clearly shows the factor $2^{5}$. Thus, $2^{5} \\mid (2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2})$ is true. To check if this is the highest power, we consider $k+1=6$. We must verify that $2^{6} \\nmid (2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2})$. If $2^{6}$ were to divide $2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}$, then there would exist an integer $m$ such that $2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2} = 2^{6} \\cdot m$. This would imply $3^{2} = 2 \\cdot m$, or $9 = 2m$. This is impossible, as $9$ is an odd integer. Therefore, the highest power of $2$ dividing the numerator is $5$. By definition, $v_{2}(2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}) = 5$. This contribution of $5$ comes directly from the factor $2^{5}$ in the numerator.\n\nNext, we evaluate the valuation for the denominator, $v_{2}(5^{3} \\cdot 2)$. Let $n_{2} = 5^{3} \\cdot 2 = 125 \\cdot 2 = 250$. The prime factorization is $2^{1} \\cdot 5^{3}$. The highest power of $2$ dividing $n_{2}$ is $2^{1}$. So, $2^{1} \\mid (5^{3} \\cdot 2)$ is true. And $2^{1+1} = 2^{2} = 4$ does not divide $250$, so $2^{2} \\nmid (5^{3} \\cdot 2)$. By definition, $v_{2}(5^{3} \\cdot 2) = 1$. This contribution of $1$ comes from the factor $2 = 2^{1}$ in the denominator.\n\nCombining these results, the $2$-adic valuation of the rational number is:\n$$v_{2}(x) = 5 - 1 = 4$$\nThe factors of $2$ in the numerator contribute positively to the valuation, while factors of $2$ in the denominator contribute negatively.\n\nSecond, we compute $v_{3}\\left(\\frac{2^{5}\\cdot 3^{2}}{5^{3}\\cdot 2}\\right)$.\nUsing the same procedure:\n$$v_{3}\\left(\\frac{2^{5}\\cdot 3^{2}}{5^{3}\\cdot 2}\\right) = v_{3}(2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}) - v_{3}(5^{3} \\cdot 2)$$\n\nLet's evaluate $v_{3}(2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2})$. The numerator $n_{1} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}$ contains the factor $3^{2}$. Thus, $3^{2} \\mid (2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2})$. The next power, $3^{3}$, does not divide $2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}$ because it would imply $2^5 = 3m$ for some integer $m$, which is impossible. So, the highest power of $3$ dividing the numerator is $2$. By definition, $v_{3}(2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}) = 2$.\n\nNext, let's evaluate $v_{3}(5^{3} \\cdot 2)$. The denominator $n_{2} = 5^{3} \\cdot 2 = 250$ does not contain any factors of $3$. The highest power of $3$ that divides $250$ is $3^{0} = 1$. This is because $3^{1} \\nmid 250$. Thus, by definition, $v_{3}(5^{3} \\cdot 2) = 0$.\n\nCombining these results, the $3$-adic valuation of the rational number is:\n$$v_{3}(x) = 2 - 0 = 2$$\nThe factor $3^{2}$ in the numerator contributes $2$ to the final valuation. The absence of a factor of $3$ in the denominator means it contributes $0$, having no effect on the $3$-adic valuation.\n\nThe computed values are $v_{2}(x) = 4$ and $v_{3}(x) = 2$.
