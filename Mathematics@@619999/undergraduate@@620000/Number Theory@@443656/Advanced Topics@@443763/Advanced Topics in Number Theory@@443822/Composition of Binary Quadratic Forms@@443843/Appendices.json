First, we must determine the complete list of reduced primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms of discriminant $D = -4$ and thereby find the class number $h(-4)$. Second, we must compute the Gauss composition of the principal reduced form with itself.\n\nPart 1: Determination of Reduced Forms and Class Number $h(-4)$\n\nA binary quadratic form $Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ is specified by the integer coefficients $(a, b, c)$. The discriminant is $D = b^2 - 4ac$. We are given $D = -4$. The form must be primitive, i.e., $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, and positive definite, i.e., $D  0$ and $a  0$.\n\nA form is reduced if it satisfies the inequalities $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$, with the additional condition that if $|b| = a$ or $a = c$, then $b \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's find all integer triples $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy these conditions for $D=-4$.\nThe discriminant equation is $b^2 - 4ac = -4$, which can be rewritten as $4ac = b^2 + 4$.\nSince $a$ and $c$ are integers, $b^2+4$ must be divisible by $4$. This implies that $b^2$ must be divisible by $4$, which in turn implies that $b$ must be an even integer. Let $b = 2k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe use the reduction inequalities to constrain the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nFrom the positive definite condition, we have $a  0$.\nThe reduction conditions are $|b| \\leq a$ and $a \\leq c$.\nSince $a \\leq c$, we have $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$. Substituting $4ac = b^2 + 4$, we get $4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 4$.\nFrom $|b| \\leq a$, we have $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nCombining these inequalities, we have:\n$4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 4 \\leq a^2 + 4$\nThis leads to $3a^2 \\leq 4$.\n\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, $a^2$ must be a positive integer. The inequality $a^2 \\leq \\frac{4}{3}$ has only one positive integer solution for $a^2$, which is $a^2 = 1$. This implies $a = 1$.\n\nNow that we have determined $a=1$, we use the condition $|b| \\leq a$ to find $b$.\n$|b| \\leq 1$.\nAs established earlier, $b$ must be an even integer. The only even integer $b$ satisfying $|b| \\leq 1$ is $b = 0$.\n\nFinally, we find the value of $c$ using the discriminant equation:\n$b^2 - 4ac = -4$\n$0^2 - 4(1)c = -4$\n$-4c = -4$\n$c = 1$.\n\nThis gives us a unique candidate for a reduced form: the triple of coefficients $(a,b,c) = (1, 0, 1)$. We must verify that this form satisfies all the required conditions.\n1. Form: $Q(x,y) = 1x^2 + 0xy + 1y^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n2. Discriminant: $D = 0^2 - 4(1)(1) = -4$. This is correct.\n3. Positive definite: $D  0$ and $a = 1  0$. This is correct.\n4. Primitive: $\\gcd(a, b, c) = \\gcd(1, 0, 1) = 1$. This is correct.\n5. Reduced:\n   - $|b| \\leq a \\implies |0| \\leq 1$, which is true.\n   - $a \\leq c \\implies 1 \\leq 1$, which is true.\n   - Tie-breaking condition: Since $a=c=1$, we must have $b \\geq 0$. Our value $b=0$ satisfies this.\nThe form $(1, 0, 1)$ is indeed a reduced primitive positive definite form of discriminant $D=-4$. Since it is the only such form we found, the complete list of such forms consists of just this one form.\n\nThe class number, denoted $h(D)$, is the number of distinct proper equivalence classes of primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $D$. This is equal to the number of reduced forms.\nSince there is only one reduced form, the class number is $h(-4) = 1$.\n\nPart 2: Gauss Composition\n\nWe are asked to compose the principal reduced form of discriminant $D=-4$ with itself. The principal form is the form representing the identity element of the class group. For positive definite forms, this is the form with $a=1$. In our case, the only reduced form is $(1, 0, 1)$, so this is necessarily the principal form.\n\nLet $Q_1(x_1, y_1) = x_1^2 + y_1^2$ and $Q_2(x_2, y_2) = x_2^2 + y_2^2$. The coefficients are $(a_1, b_1, c_1) = (1, 0, 1)$ and $(a_2, b_2, c_2) = (1, 0, 1)$. We want to find the coefficients $(a'', b'', c'')$ of the composed form $Q'' = Q_1 \\circ Q_2$.\n\nThe theory of Gauss composition provides a method to construct the composed form. First, we compute $g = \\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\frac{b_1+b_2}{2})$.\nWith our values, $g = \\gcd(1, 1, \\frac{0+0}{2}) = \\gcd(1, 1, 0) = 1$.\n\nThe first coefficient of the composed form, $a''$, is given by $a'' = \\frac{a_1 a_2}{g^2}$.\n$a'' = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{1^2} = 1$.\n\nThe second coefficient, $b''$, is an integer $B$ that is a simultaneous solution to the following system of congruences:\n1. $B \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{2a_1/g}$\n2. $B \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{2a_2/g}$\n3. $B^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a_1 a_2 / g^2}$\n\nSubstituting the given values ($a_1=1, b_1=0, a_2=1, b_2=0, D=-4, g=1$):\n1. $B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2(1)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n2. $B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2(1)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n3. $B^2 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{4(1)(1)/1^2} \\implies B^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n\nFrom the first congruence, $B$ must be an even integer. Let $B = 2k$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSubstituting this into the third congruence: $(2k)^2 = 4k^2$. This is always divisible by $4$, so $4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ for any integer $k$.\nThus, any even integer $B$ is a valid solution to the congruence system. The specific choice of $B$ affects which form within the resulting equivalence class is produced. We can choose the simplest solution, $B = 0$.\nSo, we take $b'' = 0$.\n\nThe third coefficient, $c''$, is determined by the requirement that the composed form must also have discriminant $D = -4$:\n$b''^2 - 4a''c'' = D$\n$0^2 - 4(1)c'' = -4$\n$-4c'' = -4$\n$c'' = 1$.\n\nThe resulting composed form is given by the coefficients $(a'', b'', c'') = (1, 0, 1)$.\nWe must check that this form is primitive: $\\gcd(a'', b'', c'') = \\gcd(1, 0, 1) = 1$. It is.\n\nThus, the composition of the principal form $(1, 0, 1)$ with itself yields the form $(1, 0, 1)$. This result is expected, since the class group $Cl(-4)$ has order $h(-4)=1$. The only element is the identity class, which must be its own inverse, and composing it with itself must yield the identity again.\n\nThe final answer requires the class number $h(-4)$ and the coefficients of the composed form $(a'', b'', c'')$.\n$h(-4) = 1$\n$(a'', b'', c'') = (1, 0, 1)$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3015035"}, {"introduction": "Having confirmed the behavior of the identity element, we now investigate a discriminant, $D=-15$, which gives rise to a class group with more than one element.

The given form is $f(x,y) = 2x^2 + xy + 2y^2$, which is represented by the triplet of coefficients $[a,b,c] = [2,1,2]$. The second form, $g(x,y)$, is identical to $f(x,y)$. The discriminant for this form is $D = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(2)(2) = 1 - 16 = -15$. The problem states that the discriminant is $D = -15$, which is consistent. The form $[2,1,2]$ is primitive since $\\gcd(2,1,2) = 1$. It is also reduced, as it satisfies the conditions $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$ (i.e., $|1| \\leq 2 \\leq 2$) and $b \\geq 0$ for the case $a=c$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the composition of the class of $f$ with the class of $g$. Since $f$ and $g$ represent the same form, we are effectively squaring the class of $[2,1,2]$ in the class group $Cl(D) = Cl(-15)$. We will use the Dirichlet composition algorithm.\n\nLet the two forms be $f_1 = [a_1, b_1, c_1] = [2,1,2]$ and $f_2 = [a_2, b_2, c_2] = [2,1,2]$. Both forms have discriminant $D = -15$.\nThe general algorithm for composing two primitive forms of the same discriminant requires finding an integer $B$ that satisfies a system of congruences. First, we compute the value $g = \\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\frac{b_1+b_2}{2})$.\nIn this case, $a_1=2$, $a_2=2$, $b_1=1$, and $b_2=1$.\nThus, $\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2} = \\frac{1+1}{2} = 1$.\n$g = \\gcd(2, 2, 1) = 1$.\n\nThe integer $B$ must satisfy the following congruences:\n$1$. $B \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{2a_1/g}$\n$2$. $B \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{2a_2/g}$\n$3$. $B^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a_1a_2/g^2}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$1$. $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2(2)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n$2$. $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2(2)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This is redundant.\n$3$. $B^2 \\equiv -15 \\pmod{4(2)(2)/1^2} \\implies B^2 \\equiv -15 \\pmod{16}$.\n\nWe must solve this system for $B$. The third congruence simplifies to $B^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, since $-15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$.\nFrom the first congruence, $B$ must be of the form $B=4k+1$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the second condition:\n$(4k+1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$\n$16k^2 + 8k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$\n$8k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$\nThis implies that $8k$ is a multiple of $16$, so $k$ must be an even integer. Let $k = 2j$ for some integer $j$.\nThen $B = 4(2j)+1 = 8j+1$. This means $B$ must satisfy $B \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\nWe can choose the simplest solution, which is for $j=0$, giving $B=1$.\n\nThe composed form, $F = [A, B, C]$, has coefficients given by:\n$A = \\frac{a_1 a_2}{g^2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{1^2} = 4$.\n$B = 1$ (from our choice above).\n$C = \\frac{B^2-D}{4A} = \\frac{1^2 - (-15)}{4 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{1+15}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$.\n\nSo, the composed form is $F = [4,1,1]$.\nThe discriminant of this form is $1^2 - 4(4)(1) = 1-16 = -15$, as expected.\n\nNext, we must find the unique reduced representative of the class of $F = [4,1,1]$. A positive definite form $[a,b,c]$ is reduced if $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$, with the additional condition that $b \\geq 0$ if either $|b|=a$ or $a=c$.\nFor the form $[4,1,1]$, we have $a=4$, $b=1$, $c=1$.\nThe condition $a \\leq c$ is not satisfied, since $4  1$. Therefore, the form is not reduced.\n\nWe apply the reduction algorithm.\nStep 1: The current form is $[4,1,1]$. Since $a  c$, we apply the transformation $(a,b,c) \\to (c, -b, a)$, which is an equivalence transformation corresponding to the substitution $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$.\nApplying this, we obtain the new form $[1, -1, 4]$.\n\nStep 2: Now we examine the form $[1,-1,4]$.

This is true.\nHowever, we have a case where $|b'|=a'$. The reduction condition requires that in this case, the middle coefficient must be non-negative, i.e., $b' \\geq 0$. Our form has $b'=-1$, which violates this condition. So, $[1,-1,4]$ is not yet reduced.\n\nStep 3: To address this, we apply an equivalence transformation of the type $(a',b',c') \\to (a', b'+2a'k, c'')$ for an integer $k$, choosing $k$ such that the new middle coefficient $b'' = b'+2a'k$ falls in the range $[-a', a']$ and satisfies the non-negativity condition if needed.\nWith $a'=1$ and $b'=-1$, we have $b'' = -1+2(1)k$.\nWe want $|b''| \\leq a'$, i.e., $|-1+2k| \\leq 1$.\nIf we choose $k=1$, then $b'' = -1+2(1) = 1$.\nThe condition $|1| \\leq 1$ is satisfied. Since we now have $|b''|=a'$, we require $b'' \\geq 0$. Our new $b''=1$ satisfies this.\nSo, we use $k=1$. The new form $[a'', b'', c'']$ will have $a''=a'=1$ and $b''=1$.\nThe third coefficient $c''$ is determined by the discriminant:\n$c'' = \\frac{(b'')^2-D}{4a''} = \\frac{1^2 - (-15)}{4 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4$.\nThus, the new form is $[1,1,4]$.\n\nStep 4: Finally, we check if the form $[1,1,4]$ is reduced. Let $a''=1, b''=1, c''=4$.\nThe condition $|b''| \\leq a'' \\leq c''$ translates to $|1| \\leq 1 \\leq 4$, which is true.\nWe have $|b''|=a''$, so we must check if $b'' \\geq 0$. Since $b''=1$, this is also true.\nThe form $[1,1,4]$ is reduced. This is the unique reduced representative of the composed class.\n\nThe problem asks for the leading coefficient $a$ of the reduced composed form.\nThe reduced composed form is $[1,1,4]$. Its leading coefficient is $1$.\nThis result aligns with the structure of the class group $Cl(-15)$, which is a group of order $2$. The elements are the classes of the principal form $[1,1,4]$ (the identity) and the form $[2,1,2]$.

We use the specified algorithm.\n\n1. Calculate $g$:\n$g = \\gcd(a_1, a_2, (b_1+b_2)/2) = \\gcd(2, 2, (2+2)/2) = \\gcd(2, 2, 2) = 2$.\n\n2. Calculate $A$:\n$A = \\frac{a_1 a_2}{g^2} = \\frac{2 \\times 2}{2^2} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n\n3. Determine $B$:\nThe problem states that $B$ must satisfy the congruences $B \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{2 a_1}$ and $B \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{2 a_2}$.\n$B \\equiv 2 \\pmod{2 \\times 2} \\implies B \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\n$B \\equiv 2 \\pmod{2 \\times 2} \\implies B \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nThese congruences imply $B$ must be of the form $4k+2$ for some integer $k$. The problem also states this choice must be consistent with \"$B$ being defined modulo $2A$\". Here, $2A = 2(1)=2$. Any number of the form $4k+2$ is even, so $B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which is a single value modulo $2$. This is consistent.\n\n4. Calculate $C$:\nThe third coefficient $C$ is determined by the discriminant condition: $B^2 - 4AC = D$.\n$B^2 - 4(1)C = -20 \\implies 4C = B^2 + 20$.\nSubstituting $B=4k+2$:\n$4C = (4k+2)^2 + 20 = 16k^2 + 16k + 4 + 20 = 16k^2+16k+24$.\n$C = 4k^2 + 4k + 6$.\nThe resulting form is $(A, B, C) = (1, 4k+2, 4k^2+4k+6)$. All such forms for different integer values of $k$ belong to the same proper equivalence class. Let's choose the simplest case, $k=0$, which gives $B=2$ and $C=6$.\nThe product form is $(1, 2, 6)$.\n\n5. Reduce the product form:\nThe form $(1, 2, 6)$ is not reduced because $|b|=2  a=1$. We must apply the reduction algorithm. We use an $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ transformation of the type $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  m \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which transforms a form $(a,b,c)$ into $(a, b+2am, am^2+bm+c)$.\nWe have $(a,b,c)=(1,2,6)$. We want to choose an integer $m$ to minimize $|b+2am| = |2+2(1)m| = |2+2m|$. Choosing $m=-1$ gives the new middle coefficient $b' = 2+2(-1)=0$.\nThe new form $(a', b', c')$ has:\n$a' = a = 1$.\n$b' = b+2am = 0$.\n$c' = am^2+bm+c = 1(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 6 = 1-2+6 = 5$.\nThe reduced form is $(1, 0, 5)$.\n\nThe composition of the class of $(2, 2, 3)$ with itself yields the class of $(1, 0, 5)$.\n\n**Part 3: Order and Class Number**\nLet $[f]$ denote the equivalence class of a form $f$. The set of equivalence classes forms a finite abelian group under composition, called the class group. The order of this group is the class number, $h(D)$. The class of the principal form, $[(1,0,5)]$, is the identity element of the group.\nFrom Part 2, we found that the composition of the class of the nonprincipal form $[(2,2,3)]$ with itself results in the identity class:\n$$[(2, 2, 3)] \\circ [(2, 2, 3)] = [(1, 0, 5)]$$\nThis means that the class $[(2, 2, 3)]$ is an element of order $2$ in the class group.\nIn Part 1, we found that there are exactly two equivalence classes of primitive, positive definite forms of discriminant $D=-20$, represented by the reduced forms $(1, 0, 5)$ and $(2, 2, 3)$.\nThe class number, $h(-20)$, is by definition the number of such classes.\nTherefore, the class number is $h(-20)=2$. The class group is a group of order $2$, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, with elements being the identity class $[(1,0,5)]$ and the order-$2$ class $[(2,2,3)]$. This is consistent with our composition result.\n\nThe final answer requested is the value of $h(-20)$.\n$h(-20) = 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3083509"}]}
