The validation of the problem statement confirms its soundness and well-posedness as a standard application of Hensel's lemma in number theory. All necessary data are provided, and the conditions are consistent with the requirements of the lemma.\n\nLet the polynomial be $f(x) = x^{2}-2$. We are given a prime $p=7$ and an initial solution $x_1 = 3$ to the congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. We verify the conditions for Hensel's lemma:\n$f(3) = 3^{2}-2 = 9-2 = 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nThe derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$. At the initial solution, $f'(3) = 2(3) = 6$.\nSince $f'(3) = 6 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, the condition for lifting is satisfied.\n\nThe procedure for Hensel's lifting allows us to find a sequence of solutions $x_k$ such that $f(x_k) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Given a solution $x_k$ modulo $p^k$, we seek a new solution $x_{k+1}$ modulo $p^{k+1}$ of the form $x_{k+1} = x_k + t_k p^k$, where $t_k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\n\nTo find $t_k$, we expand $f(x_{k+1})$ around $x_k$ using a Taylor series:\n$$f(x_{k+1}) = f(x_k + t_k p^k) = f(x_k) + f'(x_k)(t_k p^k) + \\frac{f''(x_k)}{2!}(t_k p^k)^2 + \\dots$$\nFor our polynomial $f(x)=x^2-2$, we have $f'(x)=2x$ and $f''(x)=2$. The expansion is:\n$$f(x_{k+1}) = f(x_k) + f'(x_k) t_k p^k + (t_k p^k)^2$$\nWe require $f(x_{k+1}) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{k+1}}$. Since $k \\ge 1$, we have $2k \\ge k+1$, which implies $(t_k p^k)^2 = t_k^2 p^{2k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{k+1}}$.\nSo, we need to solve the congruence:\n$$f(x_k) + f'(x_k) t_k p^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{k+1}}$$\nBy the definition of $x_k$, we know $f(x_k)$ is a multiple of $p^k$. So we can divide the entire congruence by $p^k$:\n$$\\frac{f(x_k)}{p^k} + f'(x_k) t_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$$\nThis yields the linear congruence for $t_k$:\n$$f'(x_k) t_k \\equiv -\\frac{f(x_k)}{p^k} \\pmod p$$\nSince $x_k \\equiv x_1 \\pmod p$, we have $f'(x_k) \\equiv f'(x_1) \\pmod p$.

The lifted solution is:\n$$x_3 = 10 + 49(2) = 10 + 98 = 108$$\nSo, $x \\equiv 108 \\pmod{343}$ is the solution. We check: $108^2 - 2 = 11664 - 2 = 11662$.

We are asked to determine the number of solutions (residue classes modulo $3^n$) for this congruence.\n\nLet the polynomial be $f(x) = x^2 - 2$. We are interested in the number of roots of $f(x)$ in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/3^n\\mathbb{Z}$ for any $n \\geq 1$.\n\nThe logical foundation for finding solutions modulo $p^n$ is to first find solutions modulo $p$ and then \"lift\" them to solutions modulo higher powers of $p$. This lifting process is formalized by Hensel's Lemma. Therefore, the first step is to analyze the base case, which is $n=1$.\n\nFor $n=1$, the congruence is $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nTo determine if this congruence has solutions, we can test all possible residue classes for $x$ modulo $3$. The residue classes are $0$, $1$, and $2$.\n- If $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $x^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n- If $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $x^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n- If $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $x^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nThe set of quadratic residues modulo $3$ (the possible values of $x^2 \\pmod{3}$) is $\\{0, 1\\}$. The value $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $3$. Therefore, the congruence $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ has no solutions. The number of solutions for $n=1$ is $0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case for an arbitrary integer $n \\geq 1$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an integer solution, let's call it $x_n$, to the congruence $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3^n}$.\nBy definition, this means that $x_n^2 - 2$ is an integer multiple of $3^n$. That is, $x_n^2 - 2 = k \\cdot 3^n$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSince $n \\geq 1$, the number $3^n$ is divisible by $3$. This implies that if $x_n^2 - 2$ is a multiple of $3^n$, it must also be a multiple of $3$.\nThis leads to the congruence $x_n^2 - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which is equivalent to $x_n^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nHowever, as we have just proven, this congruence has no integer solutions. This is a contradiction.\n\nThe assumption that a solution exists for any $n \\geq 1$ must be false. Consequently, the congruence $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3^n}$ has no solutions for any positive integer $n$. The number of solutions modulo $3^n$ is $0$ for all $n \\geq 1$. This number, $0$, is indeed independent of $n$, as suggested by the problem statement.\n\nThis result can be interpreted through the lens of Hensel's Lemma. Hensel's Lemma, in its simplest form, states that if an approximate root $a_1$ of a polynomial $f(x)$ modulo a prime $p$ exists, such that $f(a_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and the derivative $f'(a_1) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, then this root can be uniquely lifted to a root in the ring of $p$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. A root in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ corresponds to a compatible sequence of roots modulo $p^n$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nIn our problem, with $p=3$ and $f(x)=x^2-2$, the very first condition for applying Hensel's lemma is the existence of a root modulo $p=3$. We need to find an integer $a_1$ such that $f(a_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which is $a_1^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nAs established, no such integer $a_1$ exists. The lifting process described by Hensel's lemma cannot even begin. The absence of a root in the base field $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ precludes the existence of any roots in $\\mathbb{Z}/3^n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n>1$ and, by extension, any roots in the $3$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThus, the analysis confirms that for every integer $n \\geq 1$, the number of residue classes modulo $3^n$ that solve the congruence $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3^n}$ is exactly $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3085917"}, {"introduction": "Having practiced the mechanics of lifting and the preconditions for it, we now turn to a more analytical question: how efficient is this method?
