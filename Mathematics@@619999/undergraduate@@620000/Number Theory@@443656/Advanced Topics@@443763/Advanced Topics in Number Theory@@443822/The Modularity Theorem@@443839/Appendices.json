The $5$-adic valuation is $v_{5}(\\Delta) = v_{5}(64) = 0$, since $5$ does not divide $64$.\nBecause $v_{5}(\\Delta) = 0$, the elliptic curve has **good reduction** at $p=5$.\n\n**Analysis at $p=3$**:\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = 64$. The $3$-adic valuation is $v_{3}(\\Delta) = v_{3}(64) = 0$, since $3$ does not divide $64$.\nBecause $v_{3}(\\Delta) = 0$, the elliptic curve has **good reduction** at $p=3$.\n\n**Analysis at $p=2$**:\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = 64 = 2^6$. The $2$-adic valuation is $v_{2}(\\Delta) = 6$.\nSince $v_{2}(\\Delta) = 6 > 0$, the curve has bad reduction at $p=2$. To classify the bad reduction as multiplicative or additive, we can examine the $2$-adic valuation of the invariant $c_4$.\nWe calculated $c_4 = 48 = 2^4 \\cdot 3$. Thus, $v_{2}(c_4) = 4$.\nThe general criterion is:\n- If $v_p(\\Delta) > 0$ and $v_p(c_4) = 0$, the reduction is multiplicative.\n- If $v_p(\\Delta) > 0$ and $v_p(c_4) > 0$, the reduction is additive.\n\nFor $p=2$, we have $v_{2}(\\Delta)=6 > 0$ and $v_{2}(c_4)=4 > 0$. Therefore, the elliptic curve has **additive reduction** at $p=2$. This is consistent with analyzing the reduced curve $y^2 \\equiv x^3-x \\pmod 2$, which is $y^2 = x^3+x$. This reduced curve has a cusp at the point $(1,0)$, which corresponds to additive reduction.\n\n(b) We now determine the $p$-adic valuations of the minimal discriminant, $v_p(\\Delta_{\\min})$. A minimal Weierstrass model at $p$ is a model in the $\\mathbb{Q}$-isomorphism class of $E$ with integral coefficients for which the $p$-adic valuation of its discriminant is minimal. This minimal valuation is denoted $v_p(\\Delta_{\\min})$.\n\n**Valuation at $p=5$**:\nIn part (a), we found that the curve has good reduction at $p=5$. The problem states that for an odd prime $p$, an integral short Weierstrass model with good reduction is minimal at $p$. Our model $y^2 = x^3-x$ is an integral short Weierstrass model.\nThus, this model is minimal at $p=5$. The minimal discriminant's valuation is the valuation of the discriminant of this model.\n$$\nv_{5}(\\Delta_{\\min}) = v_{5}(\\Delta) = v_{5}(64) = 0\n$$\n\n**Valuation at $p=3$**:\nSimilarly, we found good reduction at $p=3$. The same rule applies. The model $y^2 = x^3-x$ is minimal at $p=3$.\n$$\nv_{3}(\\Delta_{\\min}) = v_{3}(\\Delta) = v_{3}(64) = 0\n$$\n\n**Valuation at $p=2$**:\nThe problem provides a criterion for minimality at $p=2$ for a short integral model $y^2 = x^3+ax+b$: if $v_2(a) < 4$ or $v_2(b) < 6$, the model is minimal at $2$.\nFor our model, $a=-1$ and $b=0$. We evaluate the $2$-adic valuations of the coefficients:\n- $v_{2}(a) = v_{2}(-1) = 0$.\n- $v_{2}(b) = v_{2}(0) = \\infty$.\n\nThe condition is $v_{2}(a) < 4$ or $v_{2}(b) < 6$. Since $v_{2}(a) = 0 < 4$, the condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, the model $y^2 = x^3-x$ is minimal at $p=2$.\nThe valuation of the minimal discriminant at $p=2$ is the valuation of the discriminant of our model.\n$$\nv_{2}(\\Delta_{\\min}) = v_{2}(\\Delta) = v_{2}(2^{6}) = 6\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required sum $S$:\n$$\nS = v_{2}(\\Delta_{\\min}) + v_{3}(\\Delta_{\\min}) + v_{5}(\\Delta_{\\min})\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\nS = 6 + 0 + 0 = 6\n$$\nThe value of the integer is $6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$", "id": "3092208"}]}
