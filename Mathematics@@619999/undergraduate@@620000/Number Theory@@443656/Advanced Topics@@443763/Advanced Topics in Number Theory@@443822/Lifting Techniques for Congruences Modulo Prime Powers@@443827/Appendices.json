This is the foundational step of a procedure known as Hensel's Lemma.\n\nWe are given a prime $p$, a polynomial with integer coefficients $f(x)$, and an integer $a$ such that $f(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and $f'(a) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. We seek a new solution $x_1$ to the congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$ which is of the form $x_1 = a + pt$ for some integer $t$.\n\nTo find the condition on $t$, we use the Taylor expansion of the polynomial $f(x)$ around the point $x=a$. For a polynomial, this expansion is finite and exact. The coefficients of the expansion, $\\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}$, are guaranteed to be integers for any polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients.\nThe expansion is:\n$$f(a+h) = f(a) + f'(a)h + \\frac{f^{(2)}(a)}{2!}h^2 + \\dots + \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}h^n$$\nwhere $n$ is the degree of $f(x)$.\n\nWe are interested in a solution of the form $a+pt$, so we set $h=pt$:\n$$f(a+pt) = f(a) + f'(a)(pt) + \\frac{f^{(2)}(a)}{2!}(pt)^2 + \\dots$$\n\nWe want to find $t$ such that $f(a+pt) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$. Let us consider the Taylor expansion modulo $p^2$.\nAny term of the form $\\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(pt)^k$ for $k \\ge 2$ contains a factor of $p^k$. Since $p^k$ is divisible by $p^2$ for $k \\ge 2$, all such terms are congruent to $0$ modulo $p^2$.\nTherefore, the expansion simplifies to:\n$$f(a+pt) \\equiv f(a) + f'(a)pt \\pmod{p^2}$$\nFor $f(a+pt)$ to be congruent to $0$ modulo $p^2$, we must have:\n$$f(a) + f'(a)pt \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$$\n\nWe are given that $f(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, which means $f(a)$ is a multiple of $p$. Let $f(a) = c \\cdot p$ for some integer $c$. The value of $c$ is precisely $\\frac{f(a)}{p}$. Substituting this into our congruence gives:\n$$cp + f'(a)pt \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$$\nThis congruence means that the expression $cp + f'(a)pt$ is a multiple of $p^2$. We can factor out $p$:\n$$p(c + f'(a)t) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$$\nThis implies that $c + f'(a)t$ must be a multiple of $p$. So, we can write the congruence:\n$$c + f'(a)t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\nSubstituting back $c = \\frac{f(a)}{p}$, we get the congruence that determines $t$:\n$$f'(a)t \\equiv -\\frac{f(a)}{p} \\pmod{p}$$\nSince we are given that $f'(a) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and $p$ is a prime, $f'(a)$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$, which we denote by $(f'(a))^{-1}$. We can solve for $t$:\n$$t \\equiv -\\frac{f(a)}{p} \\cdot (f'(a))^{-1} \\pmod{p}$$\n\nNow, we apply this general formula to the specific data provided in the problem:\n$p = 11$, $f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 5$, and $a = 4$.\n\nFirst, we compute $f(a)$:\n$$f(4) = 4^3 + 2(4) + 5 = 64 + 8 + 5 = 77$$\nAs required, $f(4) = 77$ is divisible by $p=11$. We find the value of the quotient $\\frac{f(a)}{p}$:\n$$\\frac{f(a)}{p} = \\frac{77}{11} = 7$$\n\nNext, we compute the formal derivative $f'(x)$:\n$$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2$$\nThen we evaluate it at $a=4$:\n$$f'(4) = 3(4^2) + 2 = 3(16) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50$$\nWe need the value of $f'(4)$ modulo $p=11$:\n$$f'(4) \\equiv 50 \\pmod{11}$$\nSince $50 = 4 \\times 11 + 6$, we have $f'(4) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$. This confirms that $f'(a) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$.\n\nNow we set up the congruence for $t$:\n$$6t \\equiv -7 \\pmod{11}$$\nTo simplify the right side, we find the least nonnegative residue of $-7$ modulo $11$:\n$$-7 \\equiv -7 + 11 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$$\nThe congruence becomes:\n$$6t \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$$\nTo solve for $t$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $6$ modulo $11$. We can check small integer multiples of $6$:\n$6 \\times 1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$\n$6 \\times 2 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\nThus, the inverse of $6$ modulo $11$ is $2$.

The congruence is:\n$$(x - 14)^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$$\nSince $14$ is a multiple of $7$, we have $14 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. The congruence simplifies to:\n$$x^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$$\nBecause $7$ is a prime number, if $7$ divides $x^{3}$, then $7$ must divide $x$.
