We are tasked with finding the solutions to the congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{3}}$, which is $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1331}$.\n\nFirst, we find the solutions to the congruence modulo $p=11$. We need to solve $x^{2} + 3x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.

We can test each residue class modulo $3$:\n- If $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $x^{3} \\equiv 0^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.

This means any solution modulo $9$ must be of the form $x = r_{1} + 3t = 2 + 3t$ for some integer $t$, where we are interested in the value of $t$ modulo $3$. We substitute this form into the congruence modulo $9$:\n$$(2 + 3t)^{3} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{9}$$\nExpanding the left side using the binomial theorem:\n$$2^{3} + 3 \\cdot 2^{2} \\cdot (3t) + 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (3t)^{2} + (3t)^{3} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{9}$$\n$$8 + 36t + 54t^{2} + 27t^{3} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{9}$$\nThe terms $36t$, $54t^{2}$, and $27t^{3}$ are all divisible by $9$, so they are congruent to $0$ modulo $9$.

To lift a root $r$ of $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^{k}}$ to a root modulo $p^{k+1}$, we seek a root of the form $r + tp^{k}$.

Therefore, there can be no solutions modulo $27$.\nHence, $N_{3} = 0$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the eventual constant value $N_{\\infty}$.\nThe argument from Step 3 can be generalized. For any integer $k \\ge 2$, suppose there exists a solution $x_{0}$ to the congruence $x^{3} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3^{k}}$. This would imply that $x_{0}$ is also a solution to the congruence modulo any power of $3$ smaller than $k$. Specifically, $x_{0}$ would have to satisfy $x_{0}^{3} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{9}$.\nSince there are no solutions modulo $9$, there can be no solutions modulo $3^{k}$ for any $k \\ge 2$.\nThus, the sequence of the number of solutions $N_{k}$ is:\n$N_{1} = 1$\n$N_{k} = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\nThe sequence of counts is $(1, 0, 0, 0, \\dots)$.

Multiplying by $3$ (the inverse of $3$ mod $4$), we get $9k \\equiv 9 \\pmod{4} \\implies k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. So, $k=4j+1$ for some integer $j$.\nSubstituting this back, $x = 27(4j+1)+24 = 108j+27+24 = 108j+51$.\nNow, substituting into the third congruence: $108j+51 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3j+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3j \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. This implies $j \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.
