A non-zero integer $D$ is the discriminant of some integral binary quadratic form $ax^{2} + bxy + cy^{2}$ (where $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) if and only if it satisfies the congruence relation $D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ or $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nWe test the provided integer $D = -13824$.\nWe can write $-13824 = 4 \\times (-3456)$. Since $-13824$ is an integer multiple of $4$, it is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$.\n$$ -13824 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} $$\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, $D = -13824$ is a valid discriminant.\n\nNext, we need to find the unique decomposition $D = D_{0} f^{2}$, where $D_{0}$ is a fundamental discriminant and $f \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$ is the conductor. A fundamental discriminant is a discriminant $D_0$ which is not of the form $k^2 D_1$ for any integer $k > 1$ and discriminant $D_1$. Equivalently, an integer $D_{0} \\neq 1$ is a fundamental discriminant if and only if one of the following conditions holds:\n1. $D_{0} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $D_{0}$ is square-free.\n2. $D_{0} = 4m$ for some square-free integer $m$ such that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nTo find $D_{0}$ and $f$, we follow a systematic procedure. We begin by finding the prime factorization of $|D|$:\n$$ |D| = 13824 $$\nWe can factorize this as:\n$$ 13824 = 128 \\times 108 = 2^7 \\times (4 \\times 27) = 2^7 \\times 2^2 \\times 3^3 = 2^9 \\cdot 3^3 $$\nSo, the integer $D$ is $D = -2^9 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\nEvery discriminant $D$ can be uniquely written as $D = s \\cdot k^2$, where $s$ is a square-free integer and $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$. We identify the largest perfect square that divides $|D|$.\n$$ |D| = 2^9 \\cdot 3^3 = (2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (2^8 \\cdot 3^2) = 6 \\cdot (2^4 \\cdot 3)^2 = 6 \\cdot 48^2 $$\nThus, we can write $D = -6 \\cdot 48^2$. In this form, the square-free part is $s = -6$.\n\nThe fundamental discriminant $D_0$ corresponding to the quadratic order is determined by the square-free kernel $s$. The rules are as follows:\n- If $s \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then the fundamental discriminant is $D_0 = s$.\n- If $s \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $s \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then the fundamental discriminant is $D_0 = 4s$.\n\nWe check the congruence class of our square-free kernel $s = -6$:\n$$ s = -6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} $$\nSince $s \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, we are in the second case. The fundamental discriminant is given by $D_0 = 4s$.\n$$ D_0 = 4 \\times (-6) = -24 $$\n\nLet us verify that $D_0 = -24$ is indeed a fundamental discriminant. We check it against the conditions:\n1. Is $D_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$? No, $-24 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n2. So we check the second condition. We write $D_0 = 4m$. Here, $m = -24/4 = -6$. Is $m$ square-free? Yes, $-6 = -1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$ has no repeated prime factors. Is $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$? We have $m = -6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe conditions are satisfied, so $D_0 = -24$ is a fundamental discriminant.\n\nFinally, we determine the conductor $f$. The conductor is an integer $f \\ge 1$ such that $D = D_0 f^2$. We can solve for $f^2$:\n$$ f^2 = \\frac{D}{D_0} = \\frac{-13824}{-24} = \\frac{13824}{24} $$\nUsing the prime factorizations we found earlier:\n$$ f^2 = \\frac{2^9 \\cdot 3^3}{24} = \\frac{2^9 \\cdot 3^3}{2^3 \\cdot 3} = 2^{9-3} \\cdot 3^{3-1} = 2^6 \\cdot 3^2 $$\nThis can be written as a perfect square:\n$$ f^2 = (2^3 \\cdot 3)^2 = (8 \\cdot 3)^2 = 24^2 $$\nSince the conductor $f$ must be a positive integer, we take the positive square root:\n$$ f = 24 $$\nThus, the integer $D = -13824$ is a discriminant with fundamental part $D_0 = -24$ and conductor $f=24$. The decomposition is $-13824 = -24 \\cdot 24^2$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(D_0, f)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-24 & 24\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3085657"}, {"introduction": "With the discriminant understood, we can now tackle the central problem of classification: determining all distinct types of forms for a given discriminant.

It is a fundamental result in the theory of binary quadratic forms that every proper equivalence class of primitive positive definite forms contains exactly one reduced form. Therefore, the class number $h(D)$ is equal to the number of such reduced forms.\n\n**1. Enumeration of Reduced Forms**\n\nWe seek integer solutions $(a, b, c)$ to the equation $b^2 - 4ac = -20$ that satisfy the reduction conditions.\nThe discriminant equation can be rewritten as $4ac = b^2 + 20$. Since $a>0$ and $c>0$ for a positive definite form with $D<0$, we must have $b^2+20 > 0$, which is always true.\nFrom the reduction condition $a \\leq c$, we have $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$. Substituting the discriminant equation gives $4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 20$.\nAnother reduction condition is $|b| \\leq a$, which implies $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nCombining these inequalities, we obtain $4a^2 \\leq a^2 + 20$, which simplifies to $3a^2 \\leq 20$, or $a^2 \\leq \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$.\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $a$ are $a=1$ and $a=2$.\n\nFurthermore, the equation $b^2 - 4ac = -20$ implies $b^2 = 4ac - 20 = 4(ac-5)$. This shows that $b^2$ must be a multiple of $4$, and therefore $b$ must be an even integer.\n\nWe now proceed with a case-by-case analysis.\n\nCase 1: $a=1$.\nThe condition $|b| \\leq a$ becomes $|b| \\leq 1$. As $b$ must be even, the only possibility is $b=0$.\nSubstituting $a=1$ and $b=0$ into the discriminant equation:\n$0^2 - 4(1)c = -20 \\implies -4c = -20 \\implies c=5$.\nWe have the form $(a,b,c) = (1,0,5)$. Let's check the reduction conditions:\n$|b| \\leq a \\implies |0| \\leq 1$, which is true.\n$a \\leq c \\implies 1 \\leq 5$, which is true.\nThe special conditions for $|b|=a$ or $a=c$ do not apply. Thus, the form is reduced.\nThe form is $f_1(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2$. It is primitive since $\\gcd(1,0,5)=1$.\n\nCase 2: $a=2$.\nThe condition $|b| \\leq a$ becomes $|b| \\leq 2$. As $b$ must be even, the possible values for $b$ are $b=0$, $b=2$, and $b=-2$.\n\nSubcase 2a: $b=0$.\n$0^2 - 4(2)c = -20 \\implies -8c = -20 \\implies c = \\frac{20}{8} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This is not an integer, so no form exists in this subcase.\n\nSubcase 2b: $b=2$.\n$2^2 - 4(2)c = -20 \\implies 4 - 8c = -20 \\implies 8c = 24 \\implies c=3$.\nWe have the form $(a,b,c) = (2,2,3)$. Let's check the reduction conditions:\n$|b| \\leq a \\implies |2| \\leq 2$, which is true.\n$a \\leq c \\implies 2 \\leq 3$, which is true.\nWe have an equality $|b|=a$. The special condition requires $b \\geq 0$. Since $b=2$, this condition is satisfied. Thus, the form is reduced.\nThe form is $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2$. It is primitive since $\\gcd(2,2,3)=1$.\n\nSubcase 2c: $b=-2$.\n$(-2)^2 - 4(2)c = -20 \\implies 4 - 8c = -20 \\implies 8c=24 \\implies c=3$.\nWe have the form $(a,b,c) = (2,-2,3)$. Let's check the reduction conditions:\n$|b| \\leq a \\implies |-2| \\leq 2$, which is true.\n$a \\leq c \\implies 2 \\leq 3$, which is true.\nWe have an equality $|b|=a$. The special condition requires $b \\geq 0$. Since $b=-2$, this condition is violated. Thus, this form is not reduced. (It is, in fact, properly equivalent to the form $(2,2,3)$.)\n\nOur exhaustive search has yielded exactly two reduced primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $D=-20$:\n1. $f_1(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2$\n2. $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2$\n\n**2. Justification via Genus Theory**\n\nThe theory of reduction of quadratic forms asserts a bijection between the set of proper equivalence classes and the set of reduced forms. Since we have found exactly two distinct reduced forms, there are exactly two proper equivalence classes for the discriminant $D=-20$.\n\nTo corroborate this result using genus theory, we first determine the number of genera for $D=-20$. A discriminant $D$ is fundamental if it is not of the form $D'k^2$ for some other discriminant $D'$ and integer $k>1$. Equivalently, for $D<0$, $D$ is fundamental if either $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and is square-free, or $D=4m$ with $m \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$ and $m$ is square-free. Here, $D=-20 = 4(-5)$. Since $m=-5$ is square-free and $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $D=-20$ is a fundamental discriminant.\n\nFor a fundamental discriminant $D$, the number of genera, $g(D)$, is given by $g(D) = 2^{k-1}$, where $k$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $D$. The prime factors of $D=-20 = -1 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5$ are $2$ and $5$. Thus, $k=2$.\nThe number of genera is $g(-20) = 2^{2-1} = 2$.\n\nThe set of all classes $C(D)$ is partitioned into $g(D)$ genera, and each genus contains the same number of classes, namely $|C(D)|/g(D) = h(D)/g(D)$.\nIn our case, there are two genera. This implies that the class number $h(-20)$ must be a multiple of $2$.\n\nThe genera are distinguished by a set of characters. For $D=-20$, the characters are determined by the prime factors of $D$. We have one odd prime factor, $p=5$, which gives the character $\\chi_5(n) = (\\frac{n}{5})$, where $(\\frac{\\cdot}{\\cdot})$ is the Legendre symbol. As $D/4 = -5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, there is an additional character, $\\chi_{-4}(m) = (-1)^{(m-1)/2}$ for an integer $m$ represented by a form. The values of these characters are constant for all integers $m$ coprime to $2D$ that can be represented by any form in a given genus.\n\nLet's evaluate the characters for the two reduced forms we found:\n\nFor $f_1(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2$: This form represents $1$ (by setting $x=1, y=0$). We have $\\gcd(1, 2D) = \\gcd(1, -40) = 1$. The character values are:\n$\\chi_5(1) = (\\frac{1}{5}) = 1$.\n$\\chi_{-4}(1) = (-1)^{(1-1)/2} = (-1)^0 = 1$.\nThe character string for the genus of $f_1$ is $(1,1)$. This is the principal genus, which always contains the principal form (the identity element of the class group).\n\nFor $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2$: This form represents $c=3$ (by setting $x=0, y=1$). We have $\\gcd(3, 2D) = \\gcd(3, -40)=1$. The character values are:\n$\\chi_5(3) = (\\frac{3}{5}) = -1$.\n$\\chi_{-4}(3) = (-1)^{(3-1)/2} = (-1)^1 = -1$.\nThe character string for the genus of $f_2$ is $(-1,-1)$.\n\nSince the two forms $f_1$ and $f_2$ have different character strings, they belong to different genera. We have found two forms, and there are exactly two genera. This means each form represents a class in a distinct genus. Since our enumeration of reduced forms yielded only these two, it follows that each genus contains exactly one class.\n\nThis confirms that there are no other proper equivalence classes. The existence of two reduced forms, distributed one per genus across the two existing genera, provides a complete classification of the classes for $D=-20$.\n\n**3. The Class Number $h(-20)$**\n\nThe class number, $h(D)$, is the number of proper equivalence classes of primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $D$. As established by the enumeration of reduced forms, this number is $2$.\n$h(-20) = (\\text{number of reduced forms}) = 2$.\nThe analysis from genus theory confirms this: two genera exist, and we found one class in each, summing to a total of two classes. Therefore, $h(-20)=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3085608"}, {"introduction": "The set of equivalence classes is not just a list; it forms a finite abelian group with an operation known as composition.

Since $a=2>0$ and $D=-20<0$, the form is positive-definite.\n\nThe problem also specifies the principal form of discriminant $D$ as $p(x,y) = x^{2} + 5 y^{2}$. The coefficients are $(1, 0, 5)$. Its discriminant is $0^{2} - 4(1)(5) = -20$, which is consistent with $D$. The form $(1,0,5)$ is the reduced principal form for discriminant $D=-20$.\n\nThe first step is to compute the square of the class of $f$, denoted $[f]^{2}$, by composing $f$ with itself. We use Gauss composition for forms of discriminant $D=-20$. Let the class of $f$ be represented by the form $(a_1, b_1, c_1) = (2, 2, 3)$. To compose it with itself, we need to compose it with a form $(a_2, b_2, c_2)$ in the same class.\n\nThe standard composition algorithm is simplified when $\\gcd(a_1, a_2) = 1$. Since we are composing $(2, 2, 3)$ with itself, $a_1=a_2=2$, and $\\gcd(2,2)=2 \\neq 1$. We must first find a form $(a', b', c')$ properly equivalent to $(2, 2, 3)$ such that $\\gcd(2, a') = 1$.\nA form $ax^2+bxy+cy^2$ properly represents an integer $N$ if $N = ax_0^2+bx_0y_0+cy_0^2$ for coprime integers $x_0, y_0$. In that case, there is an equivalent form with $N$ as its first coefficient. Let's choose $x_0=1, y_0=1$. Then $f(1,1) = 2(1)^2 + 2(1)(1) + 3(1)^2 = 7$. Since $\\gcd(1,1)=1$, there is an equivalent form with leading coefficient $7$. As $\\gcd(2,7)=1$, this will suffice.\nUsing the transformation formulas with the substitution $(x,y) \\to (x, x+y)$, we find the equivalent form is $f'(x,y) = 7x^2+8xy+3y^2$. Its discriminant is $8^2-4(7)(3) = 64-84=-20$.\nNow we compose $(a_1, b_1, c_1) = (2, 2, 3)$ and $(a_2, b_2, c_2) = (7, 8, 3)$.

Substituting into the second: $4k+2 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{14}$, which simplifies to $4k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{14}$. This congruence is solvable since $\\gcd(4,14)=2$ divides $6$. Dividing the congruence (including modulus) by $2$, we get $2k \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7$.

A positive definite form $(a,b,c)$ is reduced if $-a < b \\le a < c$, or $0 \\le b \\le a=c$.\nOur form $(14, 22, 9)$ is not reduced because $|b| > a$ and $a>c$.\nFirst, apply a transformation to reduce $b$. We apply $(x,y) \\to (x-ky, y)$ to change $b$ to $b-2ak$. With $k=1$, $b$ becomes $22 - 2(14)(1) = -6$. The condition $|-6| \\le 14$ is met. The new form is $(a, b-2ak, ak^2-bk+c) = (14, -6, 14(1)^2 - 22(1) + 9) = (14, -6, 1)$.\nThe form is now $(14, -6, 1)$. This is not reduced as $a>c$. We apply the transformation $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$, which maps $(a,b,c)$ to $(c,-b,a)$. The new form is $(1, 6, 14)$.\nThis form is not reduced because $|b| > a$ ($6>1$). We again apply the transformation to reduce $b$. We change $b$ to $b-2ak$. With $k=3$, $b$ becomes $6-2(1)(3)=0$. The condition $|0| \\le 1$ is met. The new form is $(a, b-2ak, ak^2-bk+c) = (1, 0, 1(3)^2-6(3)+14) = (1, 0, 9-18+14) = (1, 0, 5)$.\nThe form is $(1,0,5)$. Let's check if it is reduced: $a=1, b=0, c=5$. We have $-1 < 0 \\le 1$ and $a \\le c$ (actually $a<c$). So $(1,0,5)$ is the reduced form.\nThe reduced representative of $[f]^2$ is $(A,B,C) = (1,0,5)$.\n\nThe third step is to use genus theory to determine if $[f]^2$ lies in the same genus as the principal form $p(x,y)=x^2+5y^2$.\nThe reduced form of $[f]^2$ is $(1,0,5)$, which is precisely the principal form $p$. A class and the principal class are in the same genus if and only if they are both in the principal genus.\nThe principal genus is, by definition, the genus containing the principal form. It is also the subgroup of the class group consisting of all the squares of classes (the kernel of the map from the class group to the group of genus characters), by the Principal Genus Theorem.\nSince $[f]^2$ is by construction a square of a class, it must belong to the principal genus. The principal form $[p]$ is also in the principal genus. Therefore, $[f]^2$ and $[p]$ are in the same genus.\nThe membership indicator $\\gamma$ is thus $1$.\n\nThe requested quantities are the coefficients of the reduced form representing $[f]^2$, which are $A=1$, $B=0$, $C=5$, and the genus membership indicator $\\gamma=1$.\nThe final answer is presented as the row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} A & B & C & \\gamma \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3085598"}]}
