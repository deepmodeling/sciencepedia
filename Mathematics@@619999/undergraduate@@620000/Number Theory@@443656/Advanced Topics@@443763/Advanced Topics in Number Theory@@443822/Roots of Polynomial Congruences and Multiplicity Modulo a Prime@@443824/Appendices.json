It is a standard problem in elementary number theory and abstract algebra concerning polynomials over finite fields. All necessary information is provided, and the definitions are consistent with established mathematical formalism. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nWe are given the polynomial $f(x)=x^{4}-4x^{2}$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, where $p=11$ is a prime. The task is to find all roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, determine their multiplicities, and express the result as a factorization of $f(x)$ into linear factors.\n\nFirst, we find the roots of $f(x)$ by solving the congruence $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n$$x^{4}-4x^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$$\nWe can factor the polynomial expression on the left-hand side:\n$$x^{2}(x^{2}-4) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$$\nThis congruence holds if and only if $x^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ or $x^{2}-4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nThe equation $x^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ implies that $x$ must be a multiple of $11$, since $11$ is prime. In the field $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, the only solution is $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $a=0$ is a root.\n\nThe equation $x^{2}-4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ is equivalent to $x^{2} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$. The solutions to this quadratic congruence are $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv -2 \\pmod{11}$. In $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, the element $-2$ is congruent to $11-2=9$. Therefore, the solutions are $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $a=2$ and $a=9$ are roots.\n\nCombining these results, the set of roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$ is $\\{0, 2, 9\\}$.\n\nNext, we determine the multiplicity of each root. The multiplicity of a root $a$ is the largest integer $m \\geq 1$ such that $(x-a)^{m}$ divides $f(x)$ in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{F}_{11}[x]$. To find these multiplicities, we perform a complete factorization of $f(x)$ into linear factors.\n\nStarting from the factorization $f(x) = x^{2}(x^{2}-4)$, we can further factor the difference of squares term $x^{2}-4 = x^{2}-2^{2}$ as $(x-2)(x+2)$. This gives the factorization of $f(x)$ over the integers:\n$$f(x) = x^{2}(x-2)(x+2)$$\nWe now interpret this factorization in the context of $\\mathbb{F}_{11}[x]$. The coefficients are integers and can be viewed as elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$. The factor $(x+2)$ is equivalent to $(x-9)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}[x]$, because $2 \\equiv -9 \\pmod{11}$.\nThus, the factorization of $f(x)$ into linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$ is:\n$$f(x) = x^{2}(x-2)(x-9)$$\nThis can be written more explicitly in terms of the roots as $f(x) = (x-0)^{2}(x-2)^{1}(x-9)^{1}$.\n\nFrom this factorization, we can directly read the multiplicities of the roots:\n1.  For the root $a=0$, the corresponding factor is $(x-0)^{2}$. The exponent is $2$, which means the multiplicity of the root $0$ is $m=2$. Since $m \\geq 2$, this root is a multiple root.\n2.  For the root $a=2$, the corresponding factor is $(x-2)^{1}$. The exponent is $1$, which means the multiplicity of the root $2$ is $m=1$. This root is a simple root.\n3.  For the root $a=9$, the corresponding factor is $(x-9)^{1}$. The exponent is $1$, which means the multiplicity of the root $9$ is $m=1$. This root is also a simple root.\n\nAs a verification, we can employ the derivative test mentioned in the problem description. A root $a$ is a multiple root if and only if $f(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and $f'(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. The formal derivative of $f(x)=x^{4}-4x^{2}$ is $f'(x)=4x^{3}-8x$.\n-   For $a=0$: We have $f(0)=0$. The derivative is $f'(0) = 4(0)^{3}-8(0) = 0$. Since $f(0)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $f'(0)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, the root $a=0$ is a multiple root.\n-   For $a=2$: We have $f(2)=0$. The derivative is $f'(2) = 4(2)^{3}-8(2) = 4(8)-16 = 32-16 = 16$. In $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, $16 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. Since $f'(2) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, the root $a=2$ is a simple root.\n-   For $a=9$: We have $f(9)=0$. The derivative is $f'(9) = 4(9)^{3}-8(9)$. In $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, $9 \\equiv -2$, so $f'(9) \\equiv f'(-2) = 4(-2)^{3}-8(-2) = 4(-8)+16 = -32+16 = -16$. In $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, $-16 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$. Since $f'(9) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, the root $a=9$ is a simple root.\n\nThe results from the derivative test confirm our findings from the factorization.

Over $\\mathbb{Z}$, $x^{2} - 2$ has no integer roots and $x^{2} - 5x$ factors as $x(x - 5)$, yielding integer roots $0$ and $5$. Modulo $7$, the coefficient $-5$ reduces to $2$, turning $x^{2} - 5x$ into $x^{2} + 2x = x(x + 2)$, so a new linear factor $x + 2$ appears, introducing a root at $x \\equiv -2 \\equiv 5$. Additionally, the quadratic $x^{2} - 2$ that had no integer roots splits in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$ because $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $7$ (as checked explicitly), yielding two further distinct roots $3$ and $4$. Thus, coefficient reduction changes both the numerical values of the coefficients and the factorization type of the polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}[x]$, altering the root set and multiplicities.\n\nStep 4: Compute $\\Delta$.\n\nWe found $N_{\\mathbb{Z}} = 2$ and $N_{7} = 4$.
