It is a well-posed problem within the established mathematical field of number theory, specifically the theory of modular forms. The premises are scientifically grounded, the terms are well-defined, and the tasks are unambiguous.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we determine the dimension of the space of modular forms $M_{k}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$ for the specified weights. Second, we explain the conceptual link between these dimension constraints and the proof of congruences for the partition function.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of $\\dim M_{k}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$**\n\nThe ring of holomorphic modular forms for the full modular group $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a graded ring, denoted by $M(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = \\bigoplus_{k \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}, k \\ge 0} M_{k}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$. A fundamental result in the theory states that this ring is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in two variables. Specifically, it is generated by the Eisenstein series $E_{4} \\in M_{4}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$ and $E_{6} \\in M_{6}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$. That is,\n$$M(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) \\cong \\mathbb{C}[E_{4}, E_{6}]$$\nThis means that any modular form $f \\in M_{k}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$ can be written uniquely as a polynomial in $E_{4}$ and $E_{6}$. Since $E_{4}$ has weight $4$ and $E_{6}$ has weight $6$, a monomial of the form $E_{4}^{a}E_{6}^{b}$ (with $a, b$ being non-negative integers) is a modular form of weight $4a+6b$.\n\nTherefore, the space $M_{k}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$ is spanned by the set of all such monomials for which the weight is exactly $k$. The dimension of $M_{k}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$, denoted $\\dim M_{k}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$, is the number of distinct ways to write $k$ as a sum $4a+6b$ for non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. If $k$ is odd or negative, there are no such forms other than the zero form, so the dimension is $0$. The problem only asks for non-negative even weights.\n\nWe now compute the dimension for each specified weight $k$:\n\n1.  **Weight $k=0$**: We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions $(a,b)$ to the equation $4a+6b=0$. The only solution is $(a,b) = (0,0)$. This corresponds to the monomial $E_{4}^{0}E_{6}^{0}=1$, which represents the constant functions. Thus, $M_{0}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n    $\\dim M_{0}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Weight $k=4$**: We solve $4a+6b=4$. Since $a, b \\ge 0$, if $b \\ge 1$, then $6b \\ge 6 > 4$. So we must have $b=0$, which gives $4a=4$, so $a=1$. The only solution is $(a,b) = (1,0)$. This corresponds to the form $E_{4}$.\n    $\\dim M_{4}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Weight $k=6$**: We solve $4a+6b=6$. If $a \\ge 2$, then $4a \\ge 8 > 6$, so $a$ can be $0$ or $1$. If $a=1$, $4+6b=6 \\implies 6b=2$, which has no integer solution for $b$. If $a=0$, $6b=6 \\implies b=1$. The only solution is $(a,b) = (0,1)$. This corresponds to the form $E_{6}$.\n    $\\dim M_{6}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Weight $k=8$**: We solve $4a+6b=8$. If $b \\ge 2$, $6b \\ge 12 > 8$, so $b$ can be $0$ or $1$. If $b=1$, $4a+6=8 \\implies 4a=2$, no integer solution for $a$. If $b=0$, $4a=8 \\implies a=2$. The only solution is $(a,b) = (2,0)$. This corresponds to the form $E_{4}^{2}$.\n    $\\dim M_{8}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Weight $k=10$**: We solve $4a+6b=10$. If $b \\ge 2$, $6b \\ge 12 > 10$, so $b$ is $0$ or $1$. If $b=0$, $4a=10$, no integer solution. If $b=1$, $4a+6=10 \\implies 4a=4 \\implies a=1$. The only solution is $(a,b) = (1,1)$. This corresponds to the form $E_{4}E_{6}$.\n    $\\dim M_{10}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = 1$.\n\n6.  **Weight $k=12$**: We solve $4a+6b=12$. If $b \\ge 3$, $6b \\ge 18 > 12$.\n    - If $b=0$, $4a=12 \\implies a=3$. Solution: $(a,b)=(3,0)$.\n    - If $b=1$, $4a+6=12 \\implies 4a=6$, no integer solution.\n    - If $b=2$, $4a+12=12 \\implies 4a=0 \\implies a=0$. Solution: $(a,b)=(0,2)$.\n    We have two solutions, $(3,0)$ and $(0,2)$. These correspond to the monomials $E_{4}^{3}$ and $E_{6}^{2}$. Since $E_{4}$ and $E_{6}$ are algebraically independent, these two forms are linearly independent. Their linear combinations span $M_{12}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}))$. The discriminant form, $\\Delta = \\frac{1}{1728}(E_{4}^{3} - E_{6}^{2})$, is a specific non-zero element in this space, which confirms that $E_{4}^{3}$ and $E_{6}^{2}$ are not proportional.\n    $\\dim M_{12}(\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})) = 2$.\n\nThe dimensions for $k \\in \\{0,4,6,8,10,12\\}$ are $\\{1,1,1,1,1,2\\}$.\n\n**Part 2: Conceptual Link to Partition Congruences**\n\nThe finite-dimensionality of spaces of modular forms is a crucial property that allows one to prove identities and congruences for arithmetic functions whose generating functions have modular properties, such as the partition function $p(n)$. The core idea is that this property reduces the task of verifying an identity for an infinite number of coefficients to verifying it for a finite, manageable number of coefficients.\n\nThe general strategy proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Represent Arithmetic Data as a Modular Form**: The generating function for the partition function, $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p(n)q^{n} = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{m})^{-1}$ where $q = \\exp(2\\pi i z)$, is intimately related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(z) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{m})$. While not a modular form itself, certain combinations of eta-functions, known as eta-quotients, can be modular forms of a specific weight $k$ for a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$. To prove a congruence like Ramanujan's $p(5n+4) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$, the first step is to construct a modular form $f(z) = \\sum a(n) q^n$ whose coefficients $a(n)$ are congruent to $p(5n+4)$ modulo $5$.\n\n2.  **Target the Zero Form**: The goal is to prove that $f(z) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$. This is equivalent to showing that every Fourier coefficient $a(n)$ of $f(z)$ is divisible by $5$. This is an assertion about an infinite number of coefficients.\n\n3.  **Exploit Finite-Dimensionality**: This is where the structure of modular forms provides a powerful shortcut. The $q$-expansion principle (a consequence of the identity theorem for holomorphic functions, rigorously formulated in results like Sturm's Theorem) states that a modular form is uniquely determined by its $q$-expansion. More powerfully, to prove that two modular forms $f_1, f_2 \\in M_k(\\Gamma)$ are identical, one does not need to check all their coefficients. One only needs to check a finite number of them. The number of coefficients required is related to the dimension of the space.\n\n4.  **The Finite Check**: For a modular form $g(z) \\in M_k(\\Gamma)$ with integer Fourier coefficients, Sturm's theorem provides an explicit bound $C(k, \\Gamma)$ such that if the first $C(k, \\Gamma)$ coefficients of $g(z)$ are divisible by a prime $p$, then *all* coefficients are divisible by $p$. In our conceptual case, to prove $f(z) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$, we construct the appropriate modular form $f(z)$ and then computationally verify that its first $C$ coefficients are all divisible by $5$. This finite check is sufficient to establish the congruence for all $n$.\n\nA simpler illustration of this principle is proving an identity. For example, to prove $E_4(z)^2 = E_8(z)$, we note both forms lie in $M_8(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$, which we found to be one-dimensional. This means $E_4(z)^2$ must be a scalar multiple of $E_8(z)$, i.e., $E_4(z)^2 = c \\cdot E_8(z)$. The $q$-expansions begin $E_4(z) = 1 + 240q + O(q^2)$ and $E_8(z) = 1 + 480q + O(q^2)$. Comparing the constant terms, we get $1^2 = c \\cdot 1$, so $c=1$. Thus, the identity is proven by checking just one coefficient.\n\nIn summary, proving Ramanujan's congruences becomes an exercise in finding the right modular form and then performing a finite calculation. The guarantee that this finite check is sufficient to prove the infinite congruence is a direct consequence of the rigid structure and finite-dimensionality of the spaces of modular forms.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1  1  1  1  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3089208"}, {"introduction": "The finite-dimensionality of spaces of modular forms has a remarkable practical consequence, crystallized in a result known as Sturm's theorem.

For a modular form $F(\\tau) = \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\alpha_n q^n$ of integer weight $k$ on a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma \\subseteq \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, with coefficients $\\alpha_n$ being algebraic integers, the theorem states that if $\\alpha_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$ for all $n$ up to a certain bound, then $F(\\tau) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$ (i.e., all coefficients are congruent to zero). The bound, known as the Sturm bound, is given by\n$$\nB = \\frac{k}{12} [\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}): \\Gamma].\n$$\nIf $\\alpha_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$ for all integers $n$ such that $0 \\le n \\le B$, then $\\alpha_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n\nWe apply this theorem to the form $h(\\tau)$.\nThe weight is specified as $k=36$.\nThe group is the full modular group $\\Gamma = \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The index of a group in itself is $1$, so we have\n$$\n[\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}): \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})] = 1.\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the Sturm bound, we compute\n$$\nB = \\frac{36}{12} \\times 1 = 3.\n$$\nThe Sturm bound is $3$. This means that to prove $h(\\tau) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$, we must verify that its Fourier coefficients $c_n$ are congruent to zero modulo $\\ell$ for all $n$ from $0$ up to $3$. That is, we must check if $c_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe form $h(\\tau)$ is a cusp form, which by definition means its constant term $c_0$ is zero. Therefore, the condition $c_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$ is automatically satisfied and requires no verification.\nWe are left to check the coefficients for $n=1, 2, 3$.\nThe conditions to verify are:\n$c_1 = a_1 - b_1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$\n$c_2 = a_2 - b_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$\n$c_3 = a_3 - b_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\ell}$\n\nThese are equivalent to verifying the congruences $a_1 \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{\\ell}$, $a_2 \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{\\ell}$, and $a_3 \\equiv b_3 \\pmod{\\ell}$.\nThe problem asks for the minimal number of initial coefficients that must be verified, starting from $n=1$. This corresponds to checking the coefficients for $n=1, 2, 3$. The number of such coefficients is $3$.\n\nThus, to conclude that $a_n \\equiv b_n \\pmod{\\ell}$ for all $n \\ge 1$, one must verify this congruence for the first $3$ pairs of coefficients, $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, and $(a_3, b_3)$. The number of coefficients to check is $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "3089143"}]}
