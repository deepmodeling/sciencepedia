This is composite.\n  - $q = 3\\cdot 2^{\\,6} - 1 = 3\\cdot 64 - 1 = 191$. This is a prime number.\n  - $r = 9\\cdot 2^{\\,2\\cdot 6-1} - 1 = 9\\cdot 2^{\\,11} - 1 = 9\\cdot 2048 - 1 = 18432 - 1 = 18{,}431$. We test small primes: $18431/7 = 2633$. Thus $r = 7 \\cdot 2633$ is composite.\n- The values and their factorizations are correct.\n- The option states $A = 2^{\\,6}\\cdot 95\\cdot 191 = 1{,}161{,}280$ and $B = 2^{\\,6}\\cdot 18{,}431 = 1{,}179{,}584$.\n  - $A = 64\\cdot 95 \\cdot 191 = 1{,}161{,}280$. Correct.\n  - $B = 64\\cdot 18431 = 1{,}179{,}584$. Correct.\n- Compute $s(A) = s(1{,}161{,}280)$:\n  $A = 1{,}161{,}280 = 2^6 \\cdot 95 \\cdot 191 = 2^6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 191$.\n  $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(2^6)\\sigma(5)\\sigma(19)\\sigma(191) = (2^7-1)(6)(20)(192) = 127 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 192 = 2{,}926{,}080$.\n  $s(A) = \\sigma(A) - A = 2{,}926{,}080 - 1{,}161{,}280 = 1{,}764{,}800$.\n  The claim $s(1{,}161{,}280) = 1{,}764{,}800$ is correct. $s(A) \\neq B$.\n- Compute $s(B) = s(1{,}179{,}584)$:\n  $B = 1{,}179{,}584 = 2^6 \\cdot 18{,}431 = 2^6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2633$.\n  $\\sigma(B) = \\sigma(2^6)\\sigma(7)\\sigma(2633) = (127)(8)(2634) = 2{,}676{,}144$.\n  $s(B) = \\sigma(B) - B = 2{,}676{,}144 - 1{,}179{,}584 = 1{,}496{,}560$.\n  The claim $s(1{,}179{,}584) = 1{,}496{,}560$ is correct. $s(B) \\neq A$.\n- The pair is not amicable. The failure of primality for $p$ and $r$ breaks the relationship.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Take $n = 2$.**\n- The question asks to select options that show a *failure* of the amicable relationship due to a *failure* of the primality conditions. This option examines a case where the primality conditions hold.\n- The option states $p = 5$, $q = 11$, and $r = 71$ are prime.\n  - $p = 3\\cdot 2^{\\,2-1} - 1 = 3\\cdot 2 - 1 = 5$. Prime.\n  - $q = 3\\cdot 2^{\\,2} - 1 = 3\\cdot 4 - 1 = 11$. Prime.\n  - $r = 9\\cdot 2^{\\,2\\cdot 2-1} - 1 = 9\\cdot 2^{\\,3} - 1 = 72 - 1 = 71$. Prime.\n- The conditions on $p,q,r$ hold. This case, therefore, does not satisfy the problem's request to demonstrate what happens when \"at least one of $p$, $q$, or $r$ fails to be prime\".\n- For completeness, we verify the calculations:\n  - $A = 2^{\\,2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 11 = 220$.\n  - $B = 2^{\\,2}\\cdot 71 = 284$.\n  - $s(220) = s(2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11) = \\sigma(2^2)\\sigma(5)\\sigma(11) - 220 = 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 12 - 220 = 504 - 220 = 284 = B$.\n  - $s(284) = s(2^2 \\cdot 71) = \\sigma(2^2)\\sigma(71) - 284 = 7 \\cdot 72 - 284 = 504 - 284 = 220 = A$.\n- The pair $(220, 284)$ is indeed amicable. While the computations are correct, this option illustrates the success of Thābit's rule, not its failure. It serves as a contrast, not an example of the phenomenon requested. Therefore, it is not a correct answer to the question asked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nFinal Tally: Options A, B, and C correctly demonstrate, via explicit computation, that the amicable relationship fails when the primality conditions of Thābit's rule are not met. Option D demonstrates the success of the rule and thus does not meet the specified criteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3080814"}]}
