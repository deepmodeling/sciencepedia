It provides a clear set of tasks: to justify fundamental properties of the sum-of-divisors function $\\sigma(n)$ and then apply them to compute $\\sigma(496)$ and verify a specific property. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\nWe begin by addressing the two justifications requested, starting from foundational principles.\n\nFirst, we justify why the sum of divisors over a product of relatively prime integers factorizes into a product of sums over each factor. This property is known as multiplicativity. Let $\\sigma(n)$ be the function that sums all positive divisors of a positive integer $n$, defined as $\\sigma(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d$. Let $m$ and $n$ be two positive integers such that they are relatively prime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, any integer greater than $1$ has a unique representation as a product of prime powers. Since $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$, the set of prime factors of $m$ and the set of prime factors of $n$ are disjoint. Let any divisor of $mn$ be denoted by $d$. The prime factors of $d$ must be a subset of the prime factors of $mn$. Because the prime factors of $m$ and $n$ are distinct, $d$ can be uniquely written as a product $d = d_1 d_2$, where $d_1$ is a divisor of $m$ and $d_2$ is a divisor of $n$. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of divisors of $mn$ and the Cartesian product of the set of divisors of $m$ and the set of divisors of $n$.\n\nUsing this correspondence, the sum of the divisors of $mn$ can be expressed as:\n$$ \\sigma(mn) = \\sum_{d|mn} d = \\sum_{d_1|m, d_2|n} d_1 d_2 $$\nThis double summation can be factored due to the distributive property of multiplication over addition:\n$$ \\sum_{d_1|m, d_2|n} d_1 d_2 = \\left( \\sum_{d_1|m} d_1 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{d_2|n} d_2 \\right) $$\nBy the definition of the $\\sigma$ function, the two terms on the right are $\\sigma(m)$ and $\\sigma(n)$, respectively. Therefore, we have established that for any two relatively prime integers $m$ and $n$:\n$$ \\sigma(mn) = \\sigma(m)\\sigma(n) $$\n\nSecond, we justify why the sum of divisors of a prime power $p^k$ is the finite geometric sum $1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k$. Let $p$ be a prime number and $k$ be a non-negative integer. A positive integer $d$ is a divisor of $p^k$ if and only if $d$ is of the form $p^j$ for some integer $j$ such that $0 \\le j \\le k$. This is because any prime factor of $d$ must also be a prime factor of $p^k$, and the only prime factor of $p^k$ is $p$. Furthermore, the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $d$ cannot exceed $k$. Thus, the set of all positive divisors of $p^k$ is $\\{p^0, p^1, p^2, \\dots, p^k\\}$, which is equivalent to $\\{1, p, p^2, \\dots, p^k\\}$.\n\nThe sum of these divisors is, by definition, $\\sigma(p^k)$:\n$$ \\sigma(p^k) = 1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k $$\nThis is a finite geometric series with $k+1$ terms, a first term of $1$, and a common ratio of $p$. The sum can be expressed in closed form as $\\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$. The justification lies in the direct enumeration of all possible divisors.\n\nNow, we use these established facts to compute $\\sigma(496)$. First, we must find the prime factorization of the integer $496$:\n$$ 496 = 2 \\times 248 = 2^2 \\times 124 = 2^3 \\times 62 = 2^4 \\times 31 $$\nThe number $31$ is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of $496$ is $2^4 \\cdot 31^1$.\n\nWe can now apply the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$ because the factors $2^4$ and $31$ are relatively prime ($\\gcd(16, 31) = 1$):\n$$ \\sigma(496) = \\sigma(2^4 \\cdot 31) = \\sigma(2^4) \\sigma(31) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the value of $\\sigma$ for each prime power factor using the geometric sum property:\nFor the factor $2^4$:\n$$ \\sigma(2^4) = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 $$\nFor the factor $31^1$:\n$$ \\sigma(31) = \\sigma(31^1) = 1 + 31 = 32 $$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\sigma(496)$:\n$$ \\sigma(496) = 31 \\times 32 $$\nThe product is calculated as:\n$$ 31 \\times 32 = 992 $$\nSo, the value of $\\sigma(496)$ is $992$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to verify that this result equals $2 \\cdot 496$. We perform this calculation:\n$$ 2 \\cdot 496 = 992 $$\nOur computed value for $\\sigma(496)$ is indeed equal to $2 \\cdot 496$, which confirms that $496$ is a perfect number. The final answer required is the exact integer value of $\\sigma(496)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{992} $$", "id": "3088038"}, {"introduction": "The Euclid-Euler theorem provides a precise formula for even perfect numbers, $2^{p-1}(2^p-1)$, but with a critical condition: the term $2^p-1$ must be a prime number.

A positive integer $n$ is defined as perfect if the sum of its positive divisors, denoted by the sum-of-divisors function $\\sigma(n)$, satisfies the relation $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. To analyze $N$, we will use the properties of the sum-of-divisors function, $\\sigma$.\n\nThe sum-of-divisors function $\\sigma$ is a multiplicative function. This means that if two integers $a$ and $b$ are coprime, then $\\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$. This property extends to any number of pairwise coprime factors. If the prime factorization of an integer $n$ is given by $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$, then the sum of its divisors is:\n$$ \\sigma(n) = \\sigma(p_1^{k_1}) \\sigma(p_2^{k_2}) \\cdots \\sigma(p_r^{k_r}) $$\nFor a single prime power $p^k$, the sum of divisors is the sum of a geometric series:\n$$ \\sigma(p^k) = 1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1} $$\nFirst, we must find the prime factorization of $N$. The number $N$ is given as $N = 2^{9} \\cdot 1023$. We need to factor the term $1023$. Note that $1023 = 1024 - 1 = 2^{10} - 1$. A number of the form $a^n - 1$ is composite if $n$ is composite. Since $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$ is composite, $2^{10}-1$ must be composite. We can factor it as a difference of squares:\n$$ 1023 = 2^{10} - 1 = (2^5 - 1)(2^5 + 1) = (32 - 1)(32 + 1) = 31 \\cdot 33 $$\nThe number $31$ is prime. The number $33$ is composite: $33 = 3 \\cdot 11$. Both $3$ and $11$ are prime.\nThus, the prime factorization of $1023$ is $3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 31$.\n\nThe complete prime factorization of $N$ is:\n$$ N = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{1} \\cdot 11^{1} \\cdot 31^{1} $$\nNow, we can compute $\\sigma(N)$ using its multiplicative property:\n$$ \\sigma(N) = \\sigma(2^9) \\cdot \\sigma(3^1) \\cdot \\sigma(11^1) \\cdot \\sigma(31^1) $$\nWe calculate each term individually:\n$$ \\sigma(2^9) = \\frac{2^{9+1}-1}{2-1} = 2^{10} - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023 $$\n$$ \\sigma(3^1) = \\frac{3^{1+1}-1}{3-1} = \\frac{3^2 - 1}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 $$\n$$ \\sigma(11^1) = \\frac{11^{1+1}-1}{11-1} = \\frac{11^2 - 1}{10} = \\frac{120}{10} = 12 $$\n$$ \\sigma(31^1) = \\frac{31^{1+1}-1}{31-1} = \\frac{31^2 - 1}{30} = \\frac{961 - 1}{30} = \\frac{960}{30} = 32 $$\nMultiplying these values together gives $\\sigma(N)$:\n$$ \\sigma(N) = 1023 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 32 = 1023 \\cdot 1536 $$\nTo check if $N$ is perfect, we compare $\\sigma(N)$ with $2N$.\n$$ 2N = 2 \\cdot (2^9 \\cdot 1023) = 2^{10} \\cdot 1023 = 1024 \\cdot 1023 $$\nComparing the two expressions:\n$$ \\sigma(N) = 1536 \\cdot 1023 $$\n$$ 2N = 1024 \\cdot 1023 $$\nSince $1536 \\neq 1024$, it is clear that $\\sigma(N) \\neq 2N$. Therefore, the integer $N$ is not a perfect number.\n\nAs directed, we can explain this conclusion by leveraging the fact that $1023$ is composite. The Euclid-Euler theorem provides a complete characterization of even perfect numbers. It states that an even integer is a perfect number if and only if it can be written in the form $2^{p-1}(2^p-1)$, where $p$ is a prime number and the second factor, $2^p-1$, is itself a prime (known as a Mersenne prime).\nThe number $N$ is given as $N = 2^9 \\cdot 1023$. We can write this as $N = 2^{10-1} \\cdot (2^{10}-1)$. This expression has the structure $2^{k-1}(2^k-1)$ with $k=10$. For $N$ to be perfect according to the Euclid-Euler theorem, two conditions must be met: first, the exponent $k$ (which is $10$ in this case) must be a prime number. Second, the factor $2^k-1$ (which is $1023$) must also be a prime number.\nNeither condition is met. The exponent $k=10$ is a composite number. Consequently, the factor $2^{10}-1 = 1023$ must also be composite, as confirmed by its factorization $1023 = 3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 31$. Because the term $1023$ is composite, $N$ fails the test for being a perfect number.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the exact integer value of the deviation from perfectness, $\\sigma(N) - 2N$. Using the expressions we derived:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = (1023 \\cdot 1536) - (1023 \\cdot 1024) $$\nWe can factor out the common term $1023$:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = 1023 \\cdot (1536 - 1024) $$\nThe difference in the parentheses is:\n$$ 1536 - 1024 = 512 $$\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = 1023 \\cdot 512 $$\nThis product can be computed as:\n$$ 1023 \\cdot 512 = (1024 - 1) \\cdot 512 = (1024 \\cdot 512) - (1 \\cdot 512) $$\nRecognizing that $1024 = 2^{10}$ and $512 = 2^9$:\n$$ 1024 \\cdot 512 = 2^{10} \\cdot 2^9 = 2^{19} $$\nThe value of $2^{19}$ is $2^{10} \\cdot 2^9 = 1024 \\cdot 512 = 524288$.\nTherefore, the final value is:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = 524288 - 512 = 523776 $$\nThe integer value of $\\sigma(N) - 2N$ is $523776$. This positive value signifies that $N$ is an abundant number, as the sum of its divisors is greater than twice the number itself.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{523776} $$", "id": "3088040"}, {"introduction": "Transitioning from manual calculation to automated verification is a powerful step in mathematical problem-solving. This final practice [@problem_id:3088031] challenges you to design and implement an algorithm that can determine if any given even integer is perfect.

Begin from the following fundamental bases: the definition of the sum-of-divisors function, the definition of perfect numbers, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, and the multiplicativity of the sum-of-divisors function for coprime integers.\n\nLet the sum-of-divisors function be defined as follows: for a positive integer $n$, define $\\sigma(n)$ to be the sum of all positive divisors of $n$. A positive integer $n$ is called perfect if and only if $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. For the purposes of this problem, you must check perfectness for any given integer by first writing $n = 2^{a} m$ with $a \\ge 0$ and $m$ odd, then computing $\\sigma(n)$ using only general properties valid for all integers, without relying on any specialized precomputed lists or shortcuts beyond what can be derived from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and multiplicativity. In particular, use that for coprime $u$ and $v$, one has $\\sigma(uv) = \\sigma(u)\\sigma(v)$, and for prime powers $p^{e}$, one has $\\sigma(p^{e}) = \\dfrac{p^{e+1} - 1}{p - 1}$, which is a standard consequence of the geometric series in the integers. Your algorithm should handle the following additional constraints: if $n \\le 0$, the output should be the boolean value representing false; if $n$ is odd, the output should be the boolean value representing false; otherwise, compute $\\sigma(n)$ and compare it to $2n$.\n\nYou must implement a computational method that, given $n$, performs the following steps using only the general bases above: factor out the highest power of two to obtain $n = 2^{a} m$ with $m$ odd; compute $\\sigma(2^{a})$ directly using the prime power formula; compute $\\sigma(m)$ by factoring $m$ into prime powers using a method grounded in the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, and then aggregating via multiplicativity; finally, decide whether $\\sigma(n) = 2n$.\n\nYour program should evaluate the boolean perfectness results for the following test suite of inputs: $2$, $6$, $28$, $496$, $8128$, $464$, $2096128$, $9$, $33550336$. These test values are chosen to cover several facets: small non-perfect even numbers, known even perfect numbers, even numbers with an odd part that is prime but not of special form, even numbers with composite odd parts, an odd input, and a larger known even perfect number.\n\nThe required final output format is a single line containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example, if your program computes three results $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, $r_{3}$, it must print the single line $[r_{1},r_{2},r_{3}]$. In this problem, each result is a boolean value indicating whether the corresponding input is perfect. No physical units are involved, no angle units are needed, and any fractional outputs are not expected since all outputs are booleans.", "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a program to determine if an integer $n$ is a perfect number. The solution must adhere to a specific algorithmic procedure grounded in fundamental number theory principles.\n\nA positive integer $n$ is defined as a perfect number if the sum of its positive divisors equals twice the number itself. This is expressed using the sum-of-divisors function, $\\sigma(n)$, as the condition $\\sigma(n) = 2n$.\n\nThe validation process begins with handling specific cases as mandated by the problem statement:\n1.  If the input integer $n \\le 0$, the number is not a positive integer, hence it cannot be a perfect number by definition. The program must return `false`.\n2.  If the input integer $n$ is odd, the problem requires the program to return `false`. This is an algorithmic constraint that serves as a shortcut, consistent with the unproven conjecture that no odd perfect numbers exist.\n\nFor the principal case where $n$ is a positive even integer, the problem specifies a computational method based on the prime factorization of $n$. Any even integer $n$ can be uniquely expressed in the form $n = 2^{a} m$, where $a \\ge 1$ is an integer representing the exponent of the factor $2$, and $m$ is an odd integer.\n\nThe sum-of-divisors function $\\sigma$ is a multiplicative function. For any two coprime integers $u$ and $v$ (i.e., $\\text{gcd}(u, v) = 1$), it holds that $\\sigma(uv) = \\sigma(u)\\sigma(v)$.

Given an integer $n$, first check the boundary conditions: if $n \\le 0$ or if $n$ is odd, the result is `false`.\n2.  If $n$ is a positive even number, find its factorization $n=2^a m$. This is done by repeatedly dividing $n$ by $2$ to find the odd part $m$ and counting the number of divisions to find the exponent $a$.\n3.  Calculate $\\sigma(2^a)$ using the formula $2^{a+1}-1$.\n4.  Calculate $\\sigma(m)$. This is delegated to a helper function that implements factorization of an odd number $m$ via trial division. For each prime factor $p$ with exponent $e$ found in $m$, it computes $\\sigma(p^e)$ and multiplies these results together to obtain the final $\\sigma(m)$. Since $m$ is odd, the trial divisors start from $3$ and increment by $2$. The trial division proceeds up to $\\sqrt{m}$.\n5.  The total sum of divisors is calculated as $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^a) \\cdot \\sigma(m)$.\n6.  Finally, the algorithm returns the boolean result of the comparison $\\sigma(n) == 2n$.\n\nThis method systematically computes $\\sigma(n)$ from first principles and determines perfectness without relying on any pre-computed lists or specialized theorems (such as the Euclid-Euler theorem), although its correctness is demonstrated by its ability to verify numbers that conform to such theorems.
