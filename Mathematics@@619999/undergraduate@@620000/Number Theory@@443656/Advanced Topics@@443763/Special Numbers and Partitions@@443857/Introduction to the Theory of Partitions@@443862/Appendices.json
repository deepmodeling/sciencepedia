Provide your final answer as the single value of $d$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is mathematically well-defined, self-contained, and grounded in the standard definitions of the theory of partitions. All provided information is consistent and sufficient to determine a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem provides a partition $\\lambda$ of the integer $n=13$, given by the sequence $\\lambda = (5,4,2,2)$. The components of this sequence, denoted $\\lambda_i$, are $\\lambda_1 = 5$, $\\lambda_2 = 4$, $\\lambda_3 = 2$, and $\\lambda_4 = 2$. By definition, a partition is a weakly decreasing sequence of positive integers, and indeed we have $5 \\ge 4 \\ge 2 \\ge 2 > 0$. The sum of these parts is $5+4+2+2=13$, which confirms it is a partition of $13$.\n\nFirst, we describe the Ferrers diagram for $\\lambda$. A Ferrers diagram is a left-justified array of boxes (or points) where the number of boxes in the $i$-th row is given by the $i$-th part of the partition, $\\lambda_i$. For the partition $\\lambda = (5,4,2,2)$, the Ferrers diagram is constructed as follows:\n- Row $1$ contains $\\lambda_1 = 5$ boxes.\n- Row $2$ contains $\\lambda_2 = 4$ boxes.\n- Row $3$ contains $\\lambda_3 = 2$ boxes.\n- Row $4$ contains $\\lambda_4 = 2$ boxes.\n\nVisually, this can be represented as:\n```\n* * * * *\n* * * *\n* *\n* *\n```\nThis is a complete description of the Ferrers diagram as requested.\n\nNext, we must determine the size, $d$, of the Durfee square. The problem defines the Durfee square as the largest square of boxes anchored at the top-left corner of the Ferrers diagram, and provides the formal condition that its side length $d$ is the largest integer satisfying $d \\le \\lambda_d$.  This inequality means that the $d$-th row of the diagram must contain at least $d$ boxes. Since the partition is weakly decreasing ($\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots$), if the $d$-th row has at least $d$ boxes, then all preceding rows ($i=1, \\dots, d-1$) must also have at least $d$ boxes ($\\lambda_i \\ge \\lambda_d \\ge d$). Consequently, the first $d$ rows each contain at least $d$ boxes, which guarantees that a $d \\times d$ square of boxes fits in the top-left corner of the diagram.\n\nWe seek the largest integer $d$ that satisfies the condition $d \\le \\lambda_d$. We test integer values of $d$ starting from $1$.\n\n- For $d=1$: The condition is $1 \\le \\lambda_1$. From the partition, we have $\\lambda_1 = 5$. Since $1 \\le 5$, the condition is satisfied. This means a $1 \\times 1$ square fits.\n\n- For $d=2$: The condition is $2 \\le \\lambda_2$. From the partition, we have $\\lambda_2 = 4$. Since $2 \\le 4$, the condition is satisfied. This means a $2 \\times 2$ square fits.\n\n- For $d=3$: The condition is $3 \\le \\lambda_3$. From the partition, we have $\\lambda_3 = 2$. The inequality $3 \\le 2$ is false. The condition is not satisfied. This means a $3 \\times 3$ square does not fit, as the third row has only $2$ boxes.\n\n- For $d=4$: The condition is $4 \\le \\lambda_4$. From the partition, we have $\\lambda_4 = 2$. The inequality $4 \\le 2$ is false.\n\nThe set of positive integers $d$ for which the condition $d \\le \\lambda_d$ holds is $\\{1, 2\\}$. The largest integer in this set is $2$. Therefore, the size of the Durfee square is $d = 2$.\n\nTo verify, the Durfee square of size $2$ is a $2 \\times 2$ square. It requires the first two rows to have at least two boxes each. For our partition $\\lambda = (5,4,2,2)$, we have $\\lambda_1 = 5$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4$, both of which are greater than or equal to $2$. A $3 \\times 3$ square would require $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$ to all be at least $3$, but $\\lambda_3 = 2$, which is not sufficient. Thus, the largest possible square is indeed of size $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3086505"}, {"introduction": "The Ferrers diagram is more than just a picture; it's a gateway to discovering deep symmetries. In this practice [@problem_id:3086504], you will explore the concept of conjugation, a transformation equivalent to transposing the Ferrers diagram.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is validated as sound. It is a well-posed, self-contained problem in the field of number theory, specifically concerning the elementary theory of partitions. All terms are standard and the tasks are unambiguous.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of partitions of the integer $n=7$ subject to constraints related to the integer $m=3$. A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\lambda_i = n$. The integers $\\lambda_i$ are called the parts of the partition.\n\nThe problem involves four sequential tasks.\n\nFirst, we must enumerate all partitions of $n=7$ that have at most $m=3$ parts. This means we are looking for partitions with one, two, or three parts.\n\nPartitions with $1$ part:\nThere is only one such partition, where the single part must be $7$.\n$\\bullet (7)$\n\nPartitions with $2$ parts:\nWe need to find pairs $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ such that $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 7$ and $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge 1$.\nIf $\\lambda_1 = 6$, then $\\lambda_2 = 1$. This gives $(6,1)$.\nIf $\\lambda_1 = 5$, then $\\lambda_2 = 2$. This gives $(5,2)$.\nIf $\\lambda_1 = 4$, then $\\lambda_2 = 3$. This gives $(4,3)$.\nIf $\\lambda_1$ were $3$, $\\lambda_2$ would be $4$, which violates $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2$.\nSo, the partitions with $2$ parts are:\n$\\bullet (6,1)$\n$\\bullet (5,2)$\n$\\bullet (4,3)$\n\nPartitions with $3$ parts:\nWe need triples $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ such that $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 7$ and $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 1$.\nIf $\\lambda_1 = 5$, then $\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 2$. Since $\\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 1$, the only solution is $\\lambda_2 = 1, \\lambda_3 = 1$. This gives $(5,1,1)$.\nIf $\\lambda_1 = 4$, then $\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 3$. Since $4 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 1$ and $\\lambda_2 \\ge \\lceil 3/2 \\rceil = 2$, we must have $\\lambda_2=2$, which implies $\\lambda_3=1$. This gives $(4,2,1)$.\nIf $\\lambda_1 = 3$, then $\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 4$. Since $3 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 1$ and $\\lambda_2 \\ge \\lceil 4/2 \\rceil = 2$, we can have $\\lambda_2 = 3$ (so $\\lambda_3=1$) or $\\lambda_2=2$ (so $\\lambda_3=2$). This gives $(3,3,1)$ and $(3,2,2)$.\nIf $\\lambda_1$ were $2$, the sum of three parts, each at most $2$, could be at most $2+2+2=6$, which is less than $7$.\nSo, the partitions with $3$ parts are:\n$\\bullet (5,1,1)$\n$\\bullet (4,2,1)$\n$\\bullet (3,3,1)$\n$\\bullet (3,2,2)$\n\nCombining these lists, the set of all partitions of $n=7$ with at most $m=3$ parts is:\n$(7)$, $(6,1)$, $(5,2)$, $(4,3)$, $(5,1,1)$, $(4,2,1)$, $(3,3,1)$, $(3,2,2)$.\n\nSecond, for each of these partitions, we form its conjugate and verify that the largest part of the conjugate is at most $3$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ of a partition $\\lambda$ is obtained by transposing the Ferrers-Young diagram of $\\lambda$. The $j$-th part of $\\lambda'$ is the number of parts of $\\lambda$ that are greater than or equal to $j$.\nLet's analyze each partition:\n1. $\\lambda = (7)$. The diagram is one row of $7$ dots. Transposing gives $7$ rows of $1$ dot each. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1)$. The largest part is $1$, which is $\\le 3$.\n2. $\\lambda = (6,1)$. The diagram has a row of $6$ dots and a row of $1$ dot. The columns have sizes $2,1,1,1,1,1$. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$. The largest part is $2$, which is $\\le 3$.\n3. $\\lambda = (5,2)$. The diagram has a row of $5$ and a row of $2$. The columns have sizes $2,2,1,1,1$. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (2,2,1,1,1)$. The largest part is $2$, which is $\\le 3$.\n4. $\\lambda = (4,3)$. The diagram has a row of $4$ and a row of $3$. The columns have sizes $2,2,2,1$. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (2,2,2,1)$. The largest part is $2$, which is $\\le 3$.\n5. $\\lambda = (5,1,1)$. The diagram has rows of $5,1,1$. The columns have sizes $3,1,1,1,1$. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (3,1,1,1,1)$. The largest part is $3$, which is $\\le 3$.\n6. $\\lambda = (4,2,1)$. The diagram has rows of $4,2,1$. The columns have sizes $3,2,1,1$. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (3,2,1,1)$. The largest part is $3$, which is $\\le 3$.\n7. $\\lambda = (3,3,1)$. The diagram has rows of $3,3,1$. The columns have sizes $3,2,2$. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (3,2,2)$. The largest part is $3$, which is $\\le 3$.\n8. $\\lambda = (3,2,2)$. The diagram has rows of $3,2,2$. The columns have sizes $3,3,1$. The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (3,3,1)$. The largest part is $3$, which is $\\le 3$.\n\nIn all cases, the largest part of the conjugate partition is at most $m=3$, as required.\n\nThird, we justify why conjugation is a one-to-one correspondence between partitions of $n$ with at most $m$ parts and partitions of $n$ whose largest part is at most $m$.\nLet $S_A$ be the set of partitions of $n$ with at most $m$ parts. Let $S_B$ be the set of partitions of $n$ whose largest part is at most $m$. Let $C$ be the conjugation map, $C(\\lambda) = \\lambda'$.\n- Let $\\lambda \\in S_A$. The number of parts of $\\lambda$ is at most $m$. The number of parts of a partition corresponds to the number of rows in its Ferrers diagram. So, the diagram of $\\lambda$ has at most $m$ rows. When we transpose the diagram to get the diagram for $\\lambda'$, the number of rows of $\\lambda$ becomes the number of dots in the first column of $\\lambda$, which in turn becomes the number of dots in the first row of $\\lambda'$. The number of dots in the first row of $\\lambda'$ is its largest part, $\\lambda'_1$. Thus, $\\lambda'_1$ is equal to the number of parts of $\\lambda$. Since the number of parts of $\\lambda$ is $\\le m$, we have $\\lambda'_1 \\le m$. This means $\\lambda' \\in S_B$. So, the map $C$ maps $S_A$ to $S_B$.\n- Let $\\mu \\in S_B$. The largest part of $\\mu$ is at most $m$, i.e., $\\mu_1 \\le m$. The largest part of a partition corresponds to the number of dots in the first row of its Ferrers diagram, which is also the number of columns in the diagram. So, the diagram of $\\mu$ has at most $m$ columns. When we transpose the diagram to get the diagram for its conjugate $\\mu'$, the number of columns of $\\mu$ becomes the number of rows of $\\mu'$. The number of rows of $\\mu'$ is the number of parts of $\\mu'$. Thus, the number of parts of $\\mu'$ is equal to $\\mu_1$. Since $\\mu_1 \\le m$, the number of parts of $\\mu'$ is at most $m$. This means $\\mu' \\in S_A$. So, the map $C$ also maps $S_B$ to $S_A$.\n- The conjugation map is an involution, which means that applying it twice returns the original partition: $C(C(\\lambda)) = (\\lambda')' = \\lambda$. This is because transposing a matrix twice yields the original matrix.\nSince $C$ maps $S_A$ to $S_B$, and its inverse (which is $C$ itself) maps $S_B$ to $S_A$, the map $C$ is a bijection, or a one-to-one correspondence, between the sets $S_A$ and $S_B$.\n\nFourth, we determine the common cardinality of these two families for $n=7$ and $m=3$.\nFrom the first step, we explicitly enumerated the set of partitions of $n=7$ with at most $m=3$ parts. The members are $(7)$, $(6,1)$, $(5,2)$, $(4,3)$, $(5,1,1)$, $(4,2,1)$, $(3,3,1)$, and $(3,2,2)$.\nCounting these partitions, we find there are $8$ of them.\nSince conjugation is a bijection between the set of partitions of $n$ with at most $m$ parts and the set of partitions of $n$ with largest part at most $m$, these two sets must have the same size. Thus, their common cardinality is $8$.\nAs a check, the partitions of $7$ whose largest part is at most $3$ are:\n$(3,3,1)$, $(3,2,2)$, $(3,2,1,1)$, $(3,1,1,1,1)$, $(2,2,2,1)$, $(2,2,1,1,1)$, $(2,1,1,1,1,1)$, and $(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)$.\nThere are indeed $8$ such partitions, confirming our result.\n\nThe common cardinality is the number of partitions found.\nNumber of partitions = $1$ (1-part) $+ 3$ (2-parts) $+ 4$ (3-parts) $= 8$.\nThe final answer is $8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "3086504"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their individual structures, a central question in partition theory is simply: how many are there?
