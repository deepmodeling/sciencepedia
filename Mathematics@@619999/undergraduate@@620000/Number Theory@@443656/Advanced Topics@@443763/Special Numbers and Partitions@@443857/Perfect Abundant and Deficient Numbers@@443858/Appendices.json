The analysis will be performed strictly based on the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we address the integer $n=28$. The function $\\sigma(n)$ is defined as the sum of all positive divisors of $n$. To compute $\\sigma(28)$, we must first identify all positive divisors of $28$. The divisors are $1, 2, 4, 7, 14,$ and $28$.\nThe sum of these divisors is:\n$$\n\\sigma(28) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28\n$$\nSumming these values, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma(28) = 56\n$$\nA number $n$ is defined as perfect if $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. To verify if $28$ is perfect, we compare $\\sigma(28)$ with $2 \\times 28$.\n$$\n2 \\times 28 = 56\n$$\nSince $\\sigma(28) = 56$, we have confirmed that $\\sigma(28) = 2 \\times 28$. Therefore, the integer $28$ is a perfect number. The first required quantity is $\\sigma(28) = 56$.\n\nNext, we analyze the integer $n=18$. We must compute its abundancy index, $I(18) = \\frac{\\sigma(18)}{18}$. First, we find the positive divisors of $18$. The divisors are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9,$ and $18$.\nThe sum of these divisors is:\n$$\n\\sigma(18) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18\n$$\nSumming these values, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma(18) = 39\n$$\nNow, we compute the abundancy index $I(18)$:\n$$\nI(18) = \\frac{\\sigma(18)}{18} = \\frac{39}{18}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$:\n$$\nI(18) = \\frac{39 \\div 3}{18 \\div 3} = \\frac{13}{6}\n$$\nTo classify $18$ as abundant or deficient, we compare its abundancy index to $2$.

The second required quantity is $I(18) = \\frac{13}{6}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the integer $n=27$. We compute its abundancy index, $I(27) = \\frac{\\sigma(27)}{27}$. First, we find the positive divisors of $27$. The divisors are $1, 3, 9,$ and $27$.\nThe sum of these divisors is:\n$$\n\\sigma(27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n$$\nSumming these values, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma(27) = 40\n$$\nNow, we compute the abundancy index $I(27)$:\n$$\nI(27) = \\frac{\\sigma(27)}{27} = \\frac{40}{27}\n$$\nThis fraction is in its simplest form, as the prime factorization of $40$ is $2^3 \\times 5$ and that of $27$ is $3^3$, so they share no common prime factors.\nTo classify $27$, we compare its abundancy index to $2$:\n$$\n\\frac{40}{27} \\approx 1.481...\n$$\nSince $\\frac{40}{27} < 2$ (because $40 < 27 \\times 2=54$), the integer $27$ is classified as a deficient number.

The number $n$ is deficient if $I(n) < 2$, perfect if $I(n) = 2$, and abundant if $I(n) > 2$. The problem requires a computational method derived from first principles, using the prime factorization of $n$ and exact integer arithmetic, avoiding floating-point computations for the comparison.\n\nFirst, we address the constraint of using exact integer arithmetic. The comparison of the rational number $I(n)$ to the integer $2$ can be transformed into an equivalent comparison involving only integers. Since $n$ is a positive integer, we can multiply both sides of the relations by $n$ without changing their direction.\n- $I(n) < 2 \\iff \\sigma(n)/n < 2 \\iff \\sigma(n) < 2n$\n- $I(n) = 2 \\iff \\sigma(n)/n = 2 \\iff \\sigma(n) = 2n$\n- $I(n) > 2 \\iff \\sigma(n)/n > 2 \\iff \\sigma(n) > 2n$\nThis establishes the core of our method: we will compute $\\sigma(n)$ as an integer and compare it directly to the integer $2n$.\n\nNext, we must derive a formula for $\\sigma(n)$ based on the prime factorization of $n$. We are given the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that any integer $n > 1$ has a unique prime factorization of the form $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_i$ are positive integers.\n\nThe sum-of-divisors function, $\\sigma(n)$, is a multiplicative function. This means that if $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then $\\sigma(mn) = \\sigma(m)\\sigma(n)$. The prime power factors of $n$, which are $p_1^{a_1}, p_2^{a_2}, \\ldots, p_k^{a_k}$, are pairwise coprime. Applying the multiplicative property repeatedly, we can express $\\sigma(n)$ as the product of the $\\sigma$ function applied to each of its prime power factors:\n$$\n\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}) = \\sigma(p_1^{a_1}) \\sigma(p_2^{a_2}) \\cdots \\sigma(p_k^{a_k}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma(p_i^{a_i})\n$$\nThis reduces the problem to finding a formula for $\\sigma(p^a)$, where $p$ is a prime and $a$ is a positive integer. By definition, $\\sigma(p^a)$ is the sum of all positive divisors of $p^a$. The divisors of $p^a$ are $1, p, p^2, \\ldots, p^a$. Therefore, their sum is:\n$$\n\\sigma(p^a) = 1 + p + p^2 + \\cdots + p^a\n$$\nThis is a finite geometric series. The problem provides the identity for such a series:\n$$\n1 + p + p^2 + \\cdots + p^a = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}\n$$\nThis expression is guaranteed to be an integer, as $p-1$ always divides $p^{a+1}-1$ for any integer $p \\ge 2$ and $a \\ge 0$. Thus, we can compute $\\sigma(p^a)$ using exact integer arithmetic.\n\nCombining these results, we obtain a complete formula for $\\sigma(n)$ in terms of its prime factorization $n = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i}$:\n$$\n\\sigma(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\left( \\frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1} \\right)\n$$\nThe computational algorithm is as follows:\n1. For a given integer $n$, find its unique prime factorization $\\{ (p_1, a_1), (p_2, a_2), \\ldots, (p_k, a_k) \\}$. For $n=1$, the set of prime factors is empty.\n2. Calculate $\\sigma(n)$.

For each pair $(p_i, a_i)$ in the factorization, compute the term $\\sigma(p_i^{a_i}) = (p_i^{a_i+1}-1) / (p_i-1)$ using integer division. Multiply the product variable by this term.\n3. Compare the computed integer $\\sigma(n)$ with the integer $2n$.\n4. If $\\sigma(n) < 2n$, the number is deficient, and the output is $-1$.\n5.

For $n = 2^k m$, we have:\n$$ I(2^k m) = \\frac{\\sigma(2^k m)}{2^k m} $$\nSince $m$ is an odd integer, $m$ and $2^k$ are coprime for any nonnegative integer $k$.

We now analyze this inequality by considering the nature of $m$.\n\nCase 1: $m$ is an abundant number.\nIf $m$ is abundant, then by definition $I(m) > 2$.\nFor $k=0$, the number is $2^0 m = m$. The condition becomes $I(m) > 2$, which is true by assumption. Thus, if $m$ is itself an odd abundant number, the minimal nonnegative integer $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k=0$.\n\nCase 2: $m$ is a deficient or perfect number.\nIn this case, $I(m) \\le 2$. Since $m$ is odd, it is known that if it were a perfect number, it would be an odd perfect number. The existence of such numbers is an open problem, but our derivation holds regardless. For any odd $m>1$, $m$ has at least two divisors ($1$ and $m$), so $\\sigma(m) \\ge m+1$, which implies $I(m) > 1$.\nTo satisfy the inequality $(2 - 1/2^k) I(m) > 2$, we must have $2 - 1/2^k > 2/I(m)$, because $I(m) > 0$.\nRearranging the inequality to solve for $k$:\n$$ 2 - \\frac{2}{I(m)} > \\frac{1}{2^k} $$\nSubstituting $I(m) = \\sigma(m)/m$:\n$$ 2 - \\frac{2m}{\\sigma(m)} > \\frac{1}{2^k} \\implies \\frac{2\\sigma(m) - 2m}{\\sigma(m)} > \\frac{1}{2^k} $$\nLet's analyze the term $2\\sigma(m) - 2m$.\nIf $m=1$, $\\sigma(1)=1$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{2(1)-2(1)}{1} > \\frac{1}{2^k}$, which simplifies to $0 > 2^{-k}$. This is impossible for any integer $k$, as $2^{-k}$ is always positive. Therefore, for $m=1$, no nonnegative integer $k$ exists.\nIf $m>1$, its divisors include at least $1$ and $m$, so $\\sigma(m) > m$. This means $2\\sigma(m) - 2m = 2(\\sigma(m)-m) > 0$. The left side of the inequality is positive. We can take the reciprocal of both sides, which reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{2(\\sigma(m)-m)} < 2^k $$\nThis is the necessary and sufficient condition on $k$ for an odd, non-abundant integer $m > 1$. To find the minimal integer $k$ satisfying this, we can express the condition using logarithms:\n$$ k > \\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(m)}{2(\\sigma(m)-m)}\\right) $$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the minimal value is $k_{min} = \\lfloor \\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(m)}{2(\\sigma(m)-m)}\\right) \\rfloor + 1$.\nFor this case ($m$ is deficient or perfect, $m>1$), we have $1 < I(m) \\le 2$, which implies $\\sigma(m) \\le 2m$. This leads to $2m \\ge \\sigma(m)$, so $2m - \\sigma(m) \\ge 0$. Also, $\\sigma(m) > m$, so $\\sigma(m) - m > 0$.\nThe argument of the logarithm, $C = \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{2(\\sigma(m)-m)}$, satisfies $C \\ge 1$ because $\\sigma(m) \\ge 2\\sigma(m)-2m \\iff 2m \\ge \\sigma(m)$.\nSince $C \\ge 1$, we have $\\log_2(C) \\ge 0$, which implies $k_{min} \\ge 1$. This confirms that for a non-abundant $m>1$, the required $k$ must be positive.\n\nBased on this derivation, we can formulate an algorithm. For a given odd integer $m$:\n1. Compute $\\sigma(m)$. This is done by finding the prime factorization of $m$, say $m = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, and then using the formula $\\sigma(m) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r}\\sigma(p_i^{a_i}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r}\\frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}$.\n2.

If $m>1$, find the smallest integer $k \\ge 1$ satisfying $2^k > \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{2(\\sigma(m)-m)}$. This is equivalent to finding the smallest integer $k \\ge 1$ such that $2^k (2\\sigma(m)-2m) > \\sigma(m)$. This inequality can be checked iteratively for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ to avoid floating-point arithmetic. The first value of $k$ that satisfies the condition is the minimum.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented for the provided test suite. The `get_sigma` helper function performs prime factorization to compute $\\sigma(m)$. The main logic then applies the conditions derived above. For the iterative search, we can use left bit-shifts `(1 << k)` for efficient computation of $2^k$.", "answer": "```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for a predefined test suite of odd integers.\n    The solution finds the minimal nonnegative integer k such that 2^k * m is an abundant number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_sigma(n: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the sum of positive divisors, sigma(n), for a positive integer n.\n        The calculation is based on the prime factorization of n.\n        Let n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pr^ar.\n        Then sigma(n) = sigma(p1^a1) * sigma(p2^a2) * ... * sigma(pr^ar),\n        where sigma(p^a) = (p^(a+1) - 1) / (p - 1) = 1 + p + ... + p^a.\n        \"\"\"\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        \n        num = n\n        total_sigma = 1\n        \n        # Since the problem specifies m is odd, we can skip checking for factor 2.\n        p = 3\n        while p * p <= num:\n            if num % p == 0:\n                p_sum = 1\n                p_power = 1\n                while num % p == 0:\n                    p_power *= p\n                    p_sum += p_power\n                    num //= p\n                total_sigma *= p_sum\n            p += 2\n            \n        if num > 1:  # The remaining number is a prime factor.\n            total_sigma *= (num + 1)\n            \n        return total_sigma\n\n    def find_min_k(m: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the minimal nonnegative integer k for a given odd integer m.\n        \"\"\"\n        s_m = get_sigma(m)\n        \n        # Case 1: m is an abundant number (sigma(m) > 2*m).\n        # I(m) > 2, so for k=0, I(2^0 * m) = I(m) > 2.\n        # Minimal nonnegative k is 0.\n        if s_m > 2 * m:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Case 2: m is a deficient or perfect number (sigma(m) <= 2*m).\n        \n        # Subcase 2a: m = 1.\n        # I(2^k * 1) = I(2^k) = 2 - 1/2^k, which is always < 2.
