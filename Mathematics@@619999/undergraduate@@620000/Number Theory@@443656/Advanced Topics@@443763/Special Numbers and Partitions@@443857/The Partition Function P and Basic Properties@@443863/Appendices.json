We proceed with a solution based on first principles, namely direct enumeration.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of $p(n)$, the number of partitions of a non-negative integer $n$, for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the summands does not matter. To ensure each partition is represented uniquely, we adopt the standard convention of writing the parts of a partition in non-increasing order.\n\nTo ensure the lists of partitions are exhaustive for each $n > 0$, we will systematically construct them by stratifying based on the largest part, which we denote by $k$. For a given $n$, the largest part $k$ can range from $1$ to $n$. For each choice of $k$, we then need to find partitions of the remaining sum, $n-k$, under the constraint that all parts of this sub-partition are less than or equal to $k$. This systematic, recursive approach guarantees that all partitions are generated precisely once.\n\nLet us now compute $p(n)$ for each required value of $n$.\n\nFor $n=0$:\nThe problem provides the convention that $p(0)=1$. This corresponds to the empty partition, which is the unique way to represent $0$ as a sum of positive integers (a sum with zero terms).\nThus, $p(0) = 1$.\n\nFor $n=1$:\nThe only possible largest part is $k=1$. The remaining sum is $1-1=0$. This gives the single partition:\n- $1$\nTherefore, $p(1) = 1$.\n\nFor $n=2$:\nWe stratify by the largest part $k$:\n- If $k=2$: The partition is $2$.\n- If $k=1$: The partition must be a sum of $1$'s, which is $1+1$.\nThe complete list of partitions for $n=2$ is: $2$, $1+1$.\nTherefore, $p(2) = 2$.\n\nFor $n=3$:\nWe stratify by the largest part $k$:\n- If $k=3$: The partition is $3$.\n- If $k=2$: The remaining sum is $3-2=1$. We must partition $1$ into parts of size at most $2$. The only such partition is $1$. This gives the partition $2+1$.\n- If $k=1$: The partition must be a sum of $1$'s, which is $1+1+1$.\nThe complete list of partitions for $n=3$ is: $3$, $2+1$, $1+1+1$.\nTherefore, $p(3) = 3$.\n\nFor $n=4$:\nWe stratify by the largest part $k$:\n- If $k=4$: The partition is $4$.\n- If $k=3$: The remaining sum is $4-3=1$. The partition is $3+1$.\n- If $k=2$: The remaining sum is $4-2=2$. We must partition $2$ into parts of size at most $2$. As determined for $p(2)$, these partitions are $2$ and $1+1$. This gives the partitions $2+2$ and $2+1+1$.\n- If $k=1$: The partition must be a sum of $1$'s, which is $1+1+1+1$.\nThe complete list of partitions for $n=4$ is: $4$, $3+1$, $2+2$, $2+1+1$, $1+1+1+1$.\nTherefore, $p(4) = 5$.\n\nFor $n=5$:\nWe stratify by the largest part $k$:\n- If $k=5$: The partition is $5$.\n- If $k=4$: The remaining sum is $5-4=1$. The partition is $4+1$.\n- If $k=3$: The remaining sum is $5-3=2$. We must partition $2$ into parts of size at most $3$. These partitions are $2$ and $1+1$. This gives the partitions $3+2$ and $3+1+1$.\n- If $k=2$: The remaining sum is $5-2=3$. We must partition $3$ into parts of size at most $2$. From our analysis for $n=3$, the partitions of $3$ with largest part at most $2$ are $2+1$ and $1+1+1$. This gives the partitions $2+2+1$ and $2+1+1+1$.\n- If $k=1$: The partition must be a sum of $1$'s, which is $1+1+1+1+1$.\nThe complete list of partitions for $n=5$ is: $5$, $4+1$, $3+2$, $3+1+1$, $2+2+1$, $2+1+1+1$, $1+1+1+1+1$.\nTherefore, $p(5) = 7$.\n\nIn summary, the computed values are:\n$p(0) = 1$\n$p(1) = 1$\n$p(2) = 2$\n$p(3) = 3$\n$p(4) = 5$\n$p(5) = 7$\n\nThe final result is reported as a single row matrix containing these values in order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3092748"}, {"introduction": "While direct enumeration is excellent for small numbers, it quickly becomes impractical.

It is a well-posed and scientifically grounded question in the field of number theory, based on a classical identity for the partition function's generating function. All necessary information is provided, and the task is to perform a standard, albeit detailed, calculation.\n\nWe are given the ordinary generating function for the partition function $p(n)$, which counts the number of ways to write a non-negative integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers:\n$$P(q) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p(n) q^{n} = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 - q^{k}}$$\nThe problem states the convention $p(0)=1$, which is consistent with the product representation, as the constant term (the coefficient of $q^0$) of the expansion is $1$.\n\nOur objective is to determine the coefficients $p(n)$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. This requires expanding the infinite product on the right-hand side up to terms of degree $q^6$.\n\nFirst, we expand each factor in the product as a geometric series:\n$$\\frac{1}{1 - q^{k}} = 1 + q^{k} + q^{2k} + q^{3k} + \\dots = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (q^k)^j$$\nThe infinite product can thus be written as:\n$$P(q) = \\left(\\sum_{j_1=0}^{\\infty} q^{j_1 \\cdot 1}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j_2=0}^{\\infty} q^{j_2 \\cdot 2}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j_3=0}^{\\infty} q^{j_3 \\cdot 3}\\right) \\dots$$\nA term $q^n$ in the expansion of $P(q)$ is formed by choosing one term, say $q^{j_k \\cdot k}$, from each factor and multiplying them together such that the sum of the exponents is $n$:\n$$q^n = q^{j_1 \\cdot 1} q^{j_2 \\cdot 2} q^{j_3 \\cdot 3} \\dots = q^{\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} j_k k}$$\nThis corresponds to the partition $n = \\underbrace{1+\\dots+1}_{j_1 \\text{ times}} + \\underbrace{2+\\dots+2}_{j_2 \\text{ times}} + \\dots$.\n\nTo find the coefficients up to degree $6$, we need to compute the series expansion modulo $q^7$. We must justify why we can truncate the infinite product. Consider a factor $\\frac{1}{1 - q^k}$ where $k > 6$. The expansion of this factor is $1 + q^k + q^{2k} + \\dots$. Since any non-constant term has a degree of at least $k > 6$, this factor can only contribute its constant term, $1$, to any monomial of degree less than or equal to $6$.
