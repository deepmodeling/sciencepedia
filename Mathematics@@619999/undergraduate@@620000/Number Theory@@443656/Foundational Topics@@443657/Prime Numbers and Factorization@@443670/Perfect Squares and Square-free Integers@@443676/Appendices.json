We must derive this result using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA) and the definitions of these properties.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, if $n > 1$, it can be written as a unique product of prime powers:\n$$n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$$\nwhere $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ are positive integers. For the case $n=1$, its prime factorization is represented by an empty product, which means for any prime $p$, its exponent in the factorization of $1$ is $0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the condition for $n$ to be a perfect square in terms of its prime factorization exponents.\nA positive integer $n$ is a perfect square if there exists an integer $m$ such that $n = m^2$. Let the prime factorization of $m$ be $m = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \\cdots p_k^{b_k}$, where the exponents $b_i$ are non-negative integers.\nThen, $n$ can be expressed as:\n$$n = m^2 = (p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \\cdots p_k^{b_k})^2 = p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \\cdots p_k^{2b_k}$$\nBy the uniqueness of prime factorization guaranteed by the FTA, the exponents $a_i$ in the prime factorization of $n$ must be equal to the corresponding exponents $2b_i$. This implies that each exponent $a_i$ must be an even non-negative integer.\nSo, the necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ to be a perfect square is that for every prime $p$, if $v_p(n)$ is the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$, then $v_p(n)$ must be an even integer. That is, $a_i \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, \\ldots\\}$.\n\nSecond, we establish the condition for $n$ to be a square-free integer.\nA positive integer $n$ is defined as square-free if it is not divisible by any perfect square other than $1$. This is equivalent to stating that none of its prime factors appear with an exponent greater than $1$. If any exponent $a_j$ in the prime factorization of $n$ were greater than or equal to $2$, then $p_j^2$ would be a perfect square greater than $1$ that divides $n$. To avoid this, every exponent $a_j$ must be strictly less than $2$.\nSince the exponents in the prime factorization are non-negative integers, the only possible values for them are $0$ or $1$.\nSo, the necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ to be square-free is that for every prime $p$, the exponent $v_p(n)$ must be either $0$ or $1$. That is, $a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nNow, we must find the integers $n$ that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. For an integer $n$ to be both a perfect square and square-free, the exponents $a_i$ in its prime factorization must satisfy both derived conditions.\nLet $A_{sq}$ be the set of possible exponents for a perfect square, and $A_{sf}$ be the set of possible exponents for a square-free integer.\n$$A_{sq} = \\{0, 2, 4, 6, \\ldots\\}$$\n$$A_{sf} = \\{0, 1\\}$$\nThe exponents in the prime factorization of an integer that is both a perfect square and square-free must belong to the intersection of these two sets, $A_{sq} \\cap A_{sf}$.\n$$A_{sq} \\cap A_{sf} = \\{0, 2, 4, \\ldots\\} \\cap \\{0, 1\\} = \\{0\\}$$\nThis intersection contains only the integer $0$. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ to be simultaneously a perfect square and square-free is that all exponents in its prime factorization must be $0$.\n\nLet's determine the integer $n$ that satisfies this condition. If for every prime $p_i$, its exponent $a_i$ in the factorization of $n$ is $0$, then:\n$$n = p_1^0 \\cdot p_2^0 \\cdot p_3^0 \\cdots$$\nSince any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, we have:\n$$n = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdots = 1$$\nThus, the only positive integer that is both a perfect square and square-free is $1$.\n\nWe can verify this conclusion directly:\n1. Is $n=1$ a perfect square? Yes, because $1 = 1^2$.\n2. Is $n=1$ square-free? Yes, because the only perfect square that divides $1$ is $1$ itself. The definition of a square-free integer is that it is not divisible by any perfect square *other than 1*.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The convergence conditions given are consistent with the theory of Dirichlet series. No flaws are found. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The main task is split into two parts: deriving the general Euler product for $G_f(s)$ and then specializing to find $H(w)$.\n\nTo derive the Euler product for $G_f(s)$, we analyze the function in the summand, let's call it $a(n) = \\mu^2(n) f(n)$. We are given that $f(n)$ is a multiplicative function, meaning $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$ whenever $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. The function $\\mu^2(n)$ is also multiplicative. To see this, consider coprime integers $m$ and $n$. The product $mn$ is square-free if and only if both $m$ and $n$ are square-free. Thus, $\\mu^2(mn) = \\mu^2(m)\\mu^2(n)$.\nSince $a(n)$ is the product of two multiplicative functions, it is also multiplicative:\nFor $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, we have\n$$a(mn) = \\mu^2(mn)f(mn) = \\left(\\mu^2(m)\\mu^2(n)\\right) \\left(f(m)f(n)\\right) = \\left(\\mu^2(m)f(m)\\right) \\left(\\mu^2(n)f(n)\\right) = a(m)a(n)$$\nA fundamental property of Dirichlet series is that if the coefficient function $a(n)$ is multiplicative, the series admits an Euler product representation, given by:\n$$G_f(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a(n) n^{-s} = \\prod_{p} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a(p^k) p^{-ks} \\right)$$\nwhere the product is over all prime numbers $p$. This holds in the half-plane of absolute convergence.\n\nWe now evaluate the sum inside the product for a prime $p$. The terms are determined by the value of $a(p^k)=\\mu^2(p^k)f(p^k)$ for $k \\ge 0$.\nFor $k=0$, we have $a(p^0) = a(1) = \\mu^2(1)f(1)$. As $f$ is a non-zero multiplicative function, $f(1)=1$. Also, $1$ is square-free, so $\\mu^2(1)=1$. Thus, $a(1)=1$.\nFor $k=1$, we have $a(p^1) = a(p) = \\mu^2(p)f(p)$. Since any prime $p$ is square-free, $\\mu^2(p)=1$. Thus, $a(p)=f(p)$.\nFor $k \\ge 2$, the number $p^k$ is not square-free, as it is divisible by $p^2$. By definition, $\\mu^2(p^k)=0$ for $k \\ge 2$. Consequently, $a(p^k)=0$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the sum over $k$:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a(p^k) p^{-ks} = a(1)p^0 + a(p)p^{-s} + a(p^2)p^{-2s} + \\dots = 1 + f(p)p^{-s} + 0 + 0 + \\dots = 1 + f(p)p^{-s}$$\nTherefore, the Euler product for $G_f(s)$ is:\n$$G_f(s) = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 + f(p)p^{-s}\\right)$$\n\nIt is worth noting that while the problem statement provides the identity $\\mu^2(n) = \\sum_{d^2|n} \\mu(d)$, using it to derive the Euler product for a general multiplicative function $f$ is non-trivial, as it leads to expressions involving $f(md^2)$ which cannot be simplified without a stronger condition, such as complete multiplicativity of $f$. The derivation above, using the multiplicativity of the summand directly, is more general and robust.\n\nNext, we address the final part of the problem: finding a closed-form expression for $H(w) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mu^2(n) n^{-w}$.\nThis series is a special case of $G_f(s)$ where the function $f$ is the identity function $f(n)=1$ for all $n$, and the complex variable is $s=w$. The function $f(n)=1$ is multiplicative, and its value at any prime is $f(p)=1$.\nSubstituting $f(p)=1$ into the general Euler product for $G_f(s)$:\n$$H(w) = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 + p^{-w}\\right)$$\nThis product and the series converge absolutely for $\\Re(w)>1$.\n\nTo express this in terms of the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(w)$, we recall the Euler product for $\\zeta(w)$:\n$$\\zeta(w) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-w} = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 - p^{-w}\\right)^{-1}, \\quad \\text{for } \\Re(w)>1$$\nThis formula also implies that for $\\Re(2w)>1$ (i.e., $\\Re(w)>1/2$):\n$$\\zeta(2w) = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 - p^{-2w}\\right)^{-1}$$\nFor $\\Re(w)>1$, both these products are absolutely convergent. We can therefore manipulate them. Consider the ratio $\\zeta(w) / \\zeta(2w)$:\n$$\\frac{\\zeta(w)}{\\zeta(2w)} = \\frac{\\prod_{p} \\left(1 - p^{-w}\\right)^{-1}}{\\prod_{p} \\left(1 - p^{-2w}\\right)^{-1}} = \\prod_{p} \\frac{1 - p^{-2w}}{1 - p^{-w}}$$\nWe use the difference of squares factorization $1 - x^2 = (1-x)(1+x)$ with $x=p^{-w}$.\nThe numerator becomes $1 - (p^{-w})^2 = (1-p^{-w})(1+p^{-w})$.\n$$\\frac{\\zeta(w)}{\\zeta(2w)} = \\prod_{p} \\frac{(1-p^{-w})(1+p^{-w})}{1-p^{-w}} = \\prod_{p} \\left(1+p^{-w}\\right)$$\nThis resulting product is precisely the Euler product we derived for $H(w)$.\nThus, we conclude that for $\\Re(w)>1$:\n$$H(w) = \\frac{\\zeta(w)}{\\zeta(2w)}$$\nThe intermediate case mentioned in the problem, $f(n)=n^{-u}$, corresponds to $G_f(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\mu^2(n) n^{-u} n^{-s} = H(s+u)$.

In this representation, the largest square divisor of $n$ is $L(n)=s^2$.\n\nThe condition $L(n) > x^\\alpha$ becomes $s^2 > x^\\alpha$, which implies $s > x^{\\alpha/2}$.\nThe condition $n \\le x$ becomes $s^2 t \\le x$.
