An integer $p \\geq 2$ is called prime if its only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$. A pair of primes $\\left(p,q\\right)$ is a twin prime pair if $q-p=2$. For a positive integer $m$, the residue of an integer $n$ modulo $m$ is the unique integer $r$ with $0 \\leq r \\leq m-1$ such that $n \\equiv r \\pmod{m}$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and elementary divisibility, proceed as follows. First, deduce from the cases of residues modulo $6$ that any prime $p3$ must satisfy $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$ or $p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The solution proceeds in three parts as stipulated.\n\nFirst, we deduce that any prime $p3$ must have a residue of $1$ or $5$ modulo $6$.\nLet $p$ be an integer such that $p  3$. By the division algorithm, $p$ can be written in the form $p = 6k + r$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$ and a unique residue $r$ such that $0 \\le r \\le 5$. We examine each possible value of $r$:\n- If $r=0$, then $p = 6k = 2(3k)$. Since $p  3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $3k  1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $2$ and $3$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\n- If $r=2$, then $p = 6k+2 = 2(3k+1)$. Since $p  3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $3k+1  1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $2$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\n- If $r=3$, then $p = 6k+3 = 3(2k+1)$. Since $p  3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $2k+1  1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $3$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\n- If $r=4$, then $p = 6k+4 = 2(3k+2)$. Since $p  3$, we have $k \\ge 1$, which implies $3k+2  1$. Thus, $p$ is divisible by $2$. As its divisors are not only $1$ and $p$, it is not a prime number.\nThe only remaining possibilities for the residue $r$ are $r=1$ and $r=5$. Therefore, if $p$ is a prime number and $p3$, it must satisfy $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$ or $p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$.\n\nSecond, we verify that the given pairs are twin prime pairs using the definition of a prime and trial division by primes up to $\\sqrt{n}$.\n- For the pair $(3,5)$:\n  - $p=3$: The only positive divisors are $1$ and $3$, so $3$ is prime.\n  - $q=5$: For primality testing, we check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$.

We test the prime $2$. Since $7$ is not divisible by $2$, $7$ is prime.\n  - The difference is $7-5=2$, so $(5,7)$ is a twin prime pair.\n- For the pair $(11,13)$:\n  - $p=11$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{11} \\approx 3.31$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $11$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $11$ is prime.\n  - $q=13$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.60$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $13$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $13$ is prime.\n  - The difference is $13-11=2$, so $(11,13)$ is a twin prime pair.\n- For the pair $(17,19)$:\n  - $p=17$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $17$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $17$ is prime.\n  - $q=19$: We check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.35$. We test primes $2$ and $3$. Since $19$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, $19$ is prime.\n  - The difference is $19-17=2$, so $(17,19)$ is a twin prime pair.\n\nThird, we classify each prime in the ordered list $3, 5, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19$ by its least nonnegative residue modulo $6$ and construct the matrix $R$.\n- For $3$: $3 = 0 \\cdot 6 + 3 \\implies 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$. The residue is $3$.\n- For $5$: $5 = 0 \\cdot 6 + 5 \\implies 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$. The residue is $5$.\n- For $5$: $5 = 0 \\cdot 6 + 5 \\implies 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$.

The methodology prescribed is to first find all unordered triples of odd primes $\\{p, q, r\\}$ that sum to $33$, and then to count the number of distinct ordered triples that can be formed from each unordered triple.\n\nAn odd prime is a prime number greater than $2$. The sequence of odd primes begins $3, 5, 7, 11, 13, \\dots$. Let $\\{p, q, r\\}$ be an unordered triple of odd primes satisfying $p+q+r=33$. Without loss of generality, we can impose an ordering $p \\le q \\le r$ to systematically enumerate the possibilities.\n\nSince $p, q, r$ are odd primes, the smallest possible value for each is $3$. The constraint $p \\le q \\le r$ implies $3p \\le p+q+r = 33$, which gives an upper bound on the smallest prime, $p$: $p \\le 11$. Thus, we only need to consider cases where $p$ is one of the odd primes $3, 5, 7,$ or $11$.\n\nFurthermore, since $p_1, p_2, p_3 \\ge 3$, the largest possible prime in any triple is bounded by $33 - 3 - 3 = 27$.

The solution will be implemented in Python, adhering to the specified environment constraints.\n\nThe algorithmic approach is designed based on the following principles:\n\n**1. Primality Testing: Sieve of Eratosthenes**\nTo efficiently check for primality, which is a fundamental operation in this problem, we will pre-compute a primality table for all integers up to the maximum required bound, $B_{max}=10^6$. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is the specified and most appropriate algorithm for this task. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number as composite, starting from $2$.\n\nThe algorithm is initialized with a boolean array `is_prime` of size $B_{max}+1$, with all entries set to `True`. We mark $0$ and $1$ as not prime. Then, for each integer $p$ from $2$ up to $\\sqrt{B_{max}}$, if $p$ is still marked as prime, we iterate through its multiples ($p^2, p^2+p, \\dots$) and mark them as not prime. This process leaves only prime numbers marked as `True`. This pre-computation gives us an $O(1)$ lookup time for primality tests within the loop that verifies the conjecture. We also generate a sorted list of all primes up to $B_{max}$ to facilitate efficient searching.\n\n**2. Goldbach Partition Search: $p_{\\min}(N)$ Calculation**\nFor each even integer $N$ in the range $[4, B]$, we must find $p_{\\min}(N)$, the smallest prime $p$ such that $q=N-p$ is also a prime. The problem requires implementing two distinct search strategies for this task, controlled by a mode parameter $m$. In both modes, the search for the prime $p$ can be restricted to the range $p \\le N/2$, because if $N=p+q$ with $pN/2$, then $qN/2$. The pair $(q,p)$ would be found when searching for the smaller prime $q$.\n\n- **Mode $m=0$ (Increasing Search)**: We iterate through the pre-computed list of primes $p$ in ascending order. For each $p$, we check if $N-p$ is prime using our Sieve table. The first $p$ that satisfies this condition is, by definition, the smallest such prime, so it is $p_{\\min}(N)$. The search for the given $N$ can be terminated immediately upon finding this first successful partition.\n\n- **Mode $m=1$ (Decreasing Search)**: We must scan candidate primes $p$ in decreasing order from $\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor$ down to $2$. The problem specifies that we must complete the full scan and then select the smallest $p$ encountered that formed a valid Goldbach pair. This is implemented by iterating through the pre-computed primes less than or equal to $\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor$ in reverse order. A variable, `p_min_found`, is used to keep track of the smallest valid $p$ found so far. Since the iteration for $p$ proceeds from largest to smallest, any valid $p$ found will be smaller than or equal to any previously found valid prime during the scan. Thus, we continuously update `p_min_found = p` upon finding a valid pair $(p, N-p)$, and the final value after the scan completes will be the true $p_{\\min}(N)$.\n\nIf, for any $N$, no such prime $p$ is found by the conclusion of the search, it implies a failure of the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. In this case, we return a sentinel value of $-1$.\n\n**3. Verification and Extremal Bound Calculation**\nThe main program iterates through the provided test suite, with each test specified by a pair $(B, m)$. For each test case:\n- The verification flag $V(B)$ is initialized to `True`, the maximum smallest prime $M(B)$ to $0$, and the corresponding witness $N^*(B)$ to $0$.\n- A loop iterates through all even integers $N$ from $4$ to $B$.\n- Inside the loop, $p_{\\min}(N)$ is calculated using the search mode $m$ specified for the test case.\n- If the calculation of $p_{\\min}(N)$ returns the failure sentinel ($-1$), it signifies that the Goldbach conjecture is false for this $N$. We then set $V(B)=\\text{False}$, $M(B)=-1$, and $N^*(B)=-1$, and terminate the verification for the current test case.\n- If $p_{\\min}(N)$ is found, we compare it with the current value of $M(B)$. If $p_{\\min}(N)  M(B)$, we have found a new maximum, so we update $M(B) = p_{\\min}(N)$ and $N^*(B) = N$. The rule for $N^*(B)$ (selecting the minimum $N$ in case of ties) is naturally satisfied by this update logic, as we process $N$ in increasing order.\n- After the loop for $N$ completes, the resulting triplet $(V(B), M(B), N^*(B))$ is stored.\n\nFinally, the results from all test cases are aggregated into a single list and printed in the specified format.
