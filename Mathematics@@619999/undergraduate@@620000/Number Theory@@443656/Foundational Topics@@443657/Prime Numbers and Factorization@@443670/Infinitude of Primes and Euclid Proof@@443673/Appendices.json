Specifically, any prime factor of $E_6$ must be strictly greater than $p_6=13$. This is precisely what the problem requires us to demonstrate by finding such a factor.\n\nFirst, we calculate the explicit value of $E_6$:\n$$\nP_6 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 30 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 210 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 2310 \\cdot 13\n$$\nTo compute $2310 \\cdot 13$:\n$$\n2310 \\cdot 13 = 2310 \\cdot (10 + 3) = 23100 + 6930 = 30030\n$$\nSo, the Euclid number is:\n$$\nE_6 = 30030 + 1 = 30031\n$$\nNow we must find the prime factors of $30031$.

Test $p=59$:\n$$\n\\frac{30031}{59}\n$$\nWe perform the division: $300 \\div 59 = 5$ with a remainder of $5$. Bring down the $3$ to get $53$. $53 \\div 59 = 0$ with a remainder of $53$. Bring down the $1$ to get $531$. We find that $59 \\times 9 = 531$. So the division is exact.\n$$\n30031 = 59 \\times 509\n$$\nWe have successfully factored $E_6$, showing it is a composite number.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for three tasks related to the number $n! + 1$ for the specific case of $n = 10$. We will address each task in sequence, using the provided definitions and first principles of number theory.\n\nFirst, we must compute the value of $10! + 1$. The factorial of an integer $n$, denoted $n!$, is the product of all positive integers up to $n$. For $n=10$, we have:\n$$10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$$\nCalculating this product gives:\n$$10! = 3628800$$\nTherefore, the number in question is:\n$$10! + 1 = 3628800 + 1 = 3628801$$\n\nSecond, we are asked to factor $10! + 1$ to exhibit a prime factor strictly greater than $10$. Let $N = 10! + 1 = 3628801$. In accordance with the third part of the problem (which we will justify shortly), any prime factor of $N$ must be greater than $10$. The first prime number greater than $10$ is $11$. We will test if $11$ is a divisor of $3628801$.\n\nA number is divisible by $11$ if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by $11$. For $3628801$, the alternating sum is:\n$$1 - 0 + 8 - 8 + 2 - 6 + 3 = 0$$\nSince $0$ is divisible by $11$, the number $3628801$ is divisible by $11$. To confirm, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{3628801}{11} = 329891$$\nThis shows that $3628801 = 11 \\times 329891$. The number $11$ is a prime number, and it is strictly greater than $10$. Thus, we have found a prime factor that satisfies the condition.\n\nThird, we must justify from first principles why any prime divisor of $10! + 1$ must exceed $10$. Let $p$ be an arbitrary prime divisor of $10! + 1$. This means that $10! + 1$ is an integer multiple of $p$, which can be expressed using modular arithmetic as:\n$$10! + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\nWe want to prove that $p > 10$. We will proceed by contradiction. Assume that $p \\le 10$.\n\nBy the definition of a prime number, $p$ must be an integer greater than or equal to $2$. If we assume $p \\le 10$, then $p$ must be one of the integers in the set $\\{2, 3, 4, \\dots, 10\\}$. Since $p$ is a factor in the product that defines $10!$:\n$$10! = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\dots \\times p \\times \\dots \\times 10$$\nit follows that $10!$ is divisible by $p$. In terms of modular arithmetic, this is written as:\n$$10! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\nNow we have two congruences involving $p$:\n$1)$ $10! + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ (from our initial premise that $p$ divides $10!+1$)\n$2)$ $10! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ (from our contradictory assumption that $p \\le 10$)\n\nSubstituting the second congruence into the first, we get:\n$$0 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\n$$1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\nThe congruence $1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ means that $p$ divides the difference $1 - 0$, i.e., $p$ divides $1$. The only positive integer divisor of $1$ is $1$ itself. This would imply that $p = 1$.\nHowever, by the definition of a prime number, $p$ must be an integer greater than or equal to $2$ ($p \\ge 2$). The result $p=1$ contradicts the definition of a prime number.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that $p \\le 10$ must be false. This completes the proof by contradiction, and we can conclude that any prime divisor $p$ of $10! + 1$ must be strictly greater than $10$. Our empirical finding that $11$ is a factor of $10!+1$ is consistent with this general proof.\n\nThe problem asks for one explicit prime factor of $10! + 1$ that is strictly greater than $10$.
