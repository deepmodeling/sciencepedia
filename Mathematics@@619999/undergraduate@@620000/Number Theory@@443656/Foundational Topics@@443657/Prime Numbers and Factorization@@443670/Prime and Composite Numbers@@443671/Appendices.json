By definition, it can be written as a product $n = ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers satisfying $1  a  n$ and $1  b  n$. Without loss of generality, let us arrange the factors such that $a \\leq b$.\n\nWe will now prove by contradiction that $a$ must be less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$. Assume the contrary, that $a > \\sqrt{n}$. Since we have established $a \\leq b$, our assumption $a > \\sqrt{n}$ implies that $b$ must also be greater than $\\sqrt{n}$. If we multiply these two inequalities, $a > \\sqrt{n}$ and $b > \\sqrt{n}$, we obtain:\n$$ab > \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{n}$$\nSubstituting $n=ab$, we get:\n$$n > n$$\nThis is a logical contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that $a > \\sqrt{n}$ must be false. This leads to the conclusion that the smaller factor, $a$, must satisfy the inequality $a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, this divisor $a$ must itself have a prime factor $p$. Since $p$ is a factor of $a$, we have $p \\leq a$. Combining this with our derived result, we have $p \\leq a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$. This means that any composite number $n$ must have a prime factor $p$ such that $p \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\n\nConsequently, to determine if an integer $n$ is prime, we only need to test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$.
