It presents standard definitions from number theory and asks for a proof of a fundamental result followed by its direct application. The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, we must establish from first principles why, for a given integer $n \\geq 2$, it is sufficient to test for divisibility by integers up to $\\sqrt{n}$ to determine if $n$ is prime or composite. Second, we must apply this principle to find the unique prime factorization of the integer $n=8051$.\n\nPart 1: Proof of the Primality Test Bound\n\nLet $n \\geq 2$ be an integer. The problem requires us to determine if $n$ is prime or composite. According to the provided definition, if $n$ is composite, it can be written as a product $n = ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers satisfying $1  a  n$ and $1  b  n$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let us arrange the factors such that $a \\leq b$.\nWe will now prove by contradiction that $a$ must be less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$. Let us assume the contrary, that is, $a > \\sqrt{n}$.\nSince we have established $a \\leq b$, our assumption $a > \\sqrt{n}$ implies that $b$ must also be greater than $\\sqrt{n}$.\nIf we multiply these two inequalities, $a > \\sqrt{n}$ and $b > \\sqrt{n}$, we obtain:\n$$ab > \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{n}$$\nSubstituting $n=ab$, we get:\n$$n > n$$\nThis is a logical contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that $a > \\sqrt{n}$ must be false.\nThis leads to the conclusion that the smaller factor, $a$, must satisfy the inequality $a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\nSo, if an integer $n$ is composite, it must have at least one divisor $a$ (other than $1$) such that $a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, this divisor $a$ must itself have a prime factor $p$. Since $p$ is a factor of $a$, we have $p \\leq a$. Combining this with our derived result, we have $p \\leq a \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\nThis means that any composite number $n$ must have a prime factor $p$ such that $p \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.\n\nConsequently, to determine if an integer $n$ is prime, we only need to test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$. If no such prime divisor is found, it means $n$ cannot be composite, and therefore, it must be prime. Testing divisibility by all integers up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$ is also sufficient, though less efficient.\n\nPart 2: Prime Factorization of $8051$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the unique prime factorization of $n = 8051$. We apply the principle established above.\n\nFirst, we calculate the square root of $8051$ to determine the upper bound for our divisibility tests.\nWe know that $89^2 = 7921$ and $90^2 = 8100$. Thus, $\\sqrt{8051}$ is between $89$ and $90$.\n$$\\lfloor\\sqrt{8051}\\rfloor = 89$$\nWe need to test for divisibility by prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\leq 89$. The list of these primes is:\n$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89$.\n\nWe proceed with trial division:\n- Divisibility by $2$: $8051$ is odd, so it is not divisible by $2$.\n- Divisibility by $3$: The sum of the digits is $8+0+5+1=14$, which is not divisible by $3$. So $8051$ is not divisible by $3$.\n- Divisibility by $5$: The last digit is $1$, not $0$ or $5$. So $8051$ is not divisible by $5$.\n- Divisibility by $7$: $8051 = 7 \\times 1150 + 1$. Not divisible by $7$.\n- Divisibility by $11$: The alternating sum of digits is $1-5+0-8 = -12$. Not divisible by $11$.\n- Divisibility by $13$: $8051 = 13 \\times 619 + 4$.

Not divisible by $19$.\n- Divisibility by $23$: $8051 = 23 \\times 350 + 1$. Not divisible by $23$.\n- Divisibility by $29$: $8051 = 29 \\times 277 + 18$. Not divisible by $29$.\n- Divisibility by $31$: $8051 = 31 \\times 259 + 22$. Not divisible by $31$.\n- Divisibility by $37$: $8051 = 37 \\times 217 + 22$. Not divisible by $37$.\n- Divisibility by $41$: $8051 = 41 \\times 196 + 15$. Not divisible by $41$.\n- Divisibility by $43$: $8051 = 43 \\times 187 + 10$. Not divisible by $43$.\n- Divisibility by $47$: $8051 = 47 \\times 171 + 14$. Not divisible by $47$.\n- Divisibility by $53$: $8051 = 53 \\times 151 + 48$. Not divisible by $53$.\n- Divisibility by $59$: $8051 = 59 \\times 136 + 27$. Not divisible by $59$.\n- Divisibility by $61$: $8051 = 61 \\times 131 + 60$. Not divisible by $61$.\n- Divisibility by $67$: $8051 = 67 \\times 120 + 11$. Not divisible by $67$.\n- Divisibility by $71$: $8051 = 71 \\times 113 + 28$. Not divisible by $71$.\n- Divisibility by $73$: $8051 = 73 \\times 110 + 21$. Not divisible by $73$.\n- Divisibility by $79$: $8051 = 79 \\times 101 + 72$. Not divisible by $79$.\n- Divisibility by $83$: $8051 \\div 83$. We perform the division: $8051 = 83 \\times 90 + 581$. And $581 = 83 \\times 7$. Thus, $8051 = 83 \\times 90 + 83 \\times 7 = 83 \\times (90+7) = 83 \\times 97$.\n\nWe have found a factorization: $8051 = 83 \\times 97$.\n\nNow we must justify that the factors $83$ and $97$ are prime, using the same principle.\n\nJustification of primality for $83$:\nWe need to test for prime divisors up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{83}\\rfloor$. Since $9^2 = 81$ and $10^2 = 100$, we have $\\lfloor\\sqrt{83}\\rfloor = 9$.\nThe primes to test are $2, 3, 5, 7$.\n- $83$ is not divisible by $2$ (it is odd).\n- $8+3=11$, not divisible by $3$.\n- Does not end in $0$ or $5$, not divisible by $5$.\n- $83 = 7 \\times 11 + 6$, not divisible by $7$.\nSince $83$ has no prime factors less than or equal to its square root, $83$ is a prime number.\n\nJustification of primality for $97$:\nWe need to test for prime divisors up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{97}\\rfloor$. Since $9^2 = 81$ and $10^2 = 100$, we have $\\lfloor\\sqrt{97}\\rfloor = 9$.\nThe primes to test are again $2, 3, 5, 7$.\n- $97$ is not divisible by $2$ (it is odd).\n- $9+7=16$, not divisible by $3$.\n- Does not end in $0$ or $5$, not divisible by $5$.\n- $97 = 7 \\times 13 + 6$, not divisible by $7$.\nSince $97$ has no prime factors less than or equal to its square root, $97$ is a prime number.\n\nBoth factors, $83$ and $97$, are prime.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is mathematically and logically sound, self-contained, and well-posed within the domain of number theory.\n\nLet $a$ and $b$ be two integers, not both zero. The greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(a, b)$, is the largest positive integer $d$ that divides both $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is based on the Division Algorithm, which states that for any integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$, there exist unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that $a = qb + r$ and $0 \\le r  b$.\n\nFirst, we establish why the repeated application of the division algorithm produces the greatest common divisor. Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers with $a > b$. A key property is that $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, r)$, where $r$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. To prove this, let $d = \\gcd(a, b)$. By definition, $d|a$ and $d|b$. From the division algorithm equation, $r = a - qb$. Since $d$ divides $a$ and $qb$, it must divide their difference, so $d|r$. Thus, $d$ is a common divisor of $b$ and $r$. Now, let $c = \\gcd(b, r)$. By definition, $c|b$ and $c|r$. From the equation $a = qb + r$, since $c$ divides $qb$ and $r$, it must divide their sum, so $c|a$. Thus, $c$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Since $d$ is the *greatest* common divisor of $a$ and $b$, we must have $c \\le d$. Similarly, since $c$ is the *greatest* common divisor of $b$ and $r$, and $d$ is a common divisor of $b$ and $r$, we must have $d \\le c$. Combining these, we get $c = d$, which proves $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, r)$.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm applies this property iteratively. Let $r_{-1} = a$ and $r_0 = b$. We generate a sequence of remainders:\n$$r_{-1} = q_1 r_0 + r_1, \\quad 0  r_1  r_0$$\n$$r_0 = q_2 r_1 + r_2, \\quad 0  r_2  r_1$$\n$$r_1 = q_3 r_2 + r_3, \\quad 0  r_3  r_2$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$r_{k-2} = q_k r_{k-1} + r_k, \\quad 0  r_k  r_{k-1}$$\n$$r_{k-1} = q_{k+1} r_k + 0$$\nThe sequence of remainders $r_0, r_1, r_2, \\ldots$ is a strictly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers: $b = r_0 > r_1 > r_2 > \\dots > r_k > 0$. Such a sequence must be finite and must terminate, which occurs when a remainder of $0$ is reached. The last non-zero remainder in this sequence is $r_k$.\nFrom the property $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, r)$, we have:\n$$\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(r_{-1}, r_0) = \\gcd(r_0, r_1) = \\gcd(r_1, r_2) = \\cdots = \\gcd(r_{k-1}, r_k)$$\nThe last pair is $(r_k, 0)$. Since any integer divides $0$, the common divisors of $r_k$ and $0$ are just the divisors of $r_k$. The greatest positive divisor of $r_k$ is $r_k$ itself. Therefore, $\\gcd(r_k, 0) = r_k$. This establishes that the final non-zero remainder, $r_k$, is indeed $\\gcd(a, b)$.\n\nSecond, we explain why back-substitution yields a representation for Bézout's identity. Bézout's identity states that for integers $a$ and $b$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = \\gcd(a, b)$. The Euclidean algorithm provides a constructive proof. We start from the second-to-last equation of the algorithm:\n$$r_{k-2} = q_k r_{k-1} + r_k$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the gcd, $r_k$, as a linear combination of the two preceding remainders, $r_{k-2}$ and $r_{k-1}$:\n$$r_k = r_{k-2} - q_k r_{k-1}$$\nThe equation directly above it is $r_{k-3} = q_{k-1} r_{k-2} + r_{k-1}$, which can be rearranged to $r_{k-1} = r_{k-3} - q_{k-1} r_{k-2}$. We substitute this expression for $r_{k-1}$ into the equation for $r_k$:\n$$r_k = r_{k-2} - q_k (r_{k-3} - q_{k-1} r_{k-2})$$\n$$r_k = (1 + q_k q_{k-1})r_{k-2} - (q_k)r_{k-3}$$\nNow, $r_k$ is expressed as a linear combination of $r_{k-2}$ and $r_{k-3}$. This process is repeated, working backwards (back-substituting) up the sequence of equations. At each step, a remainder $r_i$ is replaced with a linear combination of $r_{i-1}$ and $r_{i-2}$, until finally $r_k$ is expressed as a linear combination of the original numbers, $r_{-1}=a$ and $r_0=b$. This produces the integers $x$ and $y$ of Bézout's identity.\n\nNow, we apply this to compute $\\gcd(123456, 7890)$. Let $a = 123456$ and $b = 7890$.\n$1. \\quad 123456 = 15 \\cdot 7890 + 5106$\n$2. \\quad 7890 = 1 \\cdot 5106 + 2784$\n$3. \\quad 5106 = 1 \\cdot 2784 + 2322$\n$4. \\quad 2784 = 1 \\cdot 2322 + 462$\n$5. \\quad 2322 = 5 \\cdot 462 + 12$\n$6. \\quad 462 = 38 \\cdot 12 + 6$\n$7. \\quad 12 = 2 \\cdot 6 + 0$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $6$.

We must find all possible values of $n$ that can be formed from integers $a$ and $b$ satisfying this relation.\n\nFirst, we observe that since $n = a^{2}$ for some integer $a$, $n$ must be a perfect square.

This shows that for any prime $p$, the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of a perfect square $x^2$ is $v_p(x^2) = 2v_p(x)$, which is an even integer. Note that this is also true if $x=1$, where all exponents are $0$, which is an even number.\n\nNow we apply this principle to the equation $a^{2} = 3b^{2}$.\nLet's analyze the exponent of the prime $p=3$ in the factorizations of both sides of the equation.\n\nFor the left-hand side, $a^{2}$:\nThe exponent of the prime $3$ in the factorization of $a^{2}$ is $v_3(a^{2})$.

The sum of $1$ and an even number ($2v_3(b)$) is always an odd integer.\n\nFor the equality $a^{2} = 3b^{2}$ to hold, the two integers must be identical.
