To verify that $47$ is prime, we test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\\sqrt{47}$.

The number $27$ is not prime because it is divisible by $3$ (since $27 = 3 \\times 9 = 3^3$). Therefore, $p=13$ is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nCase $p=17$:\nWe compute $2p+1 = 2(17)+1 = 35$. The number $35$ is not prime because it is divisible by $5$ and $7$ (since $35 = 5 \\times 7$). Therefore, $p=17$ is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nCase $p=19$:\nWe compute $2p+1 = 2(19)+1 = 39$.
