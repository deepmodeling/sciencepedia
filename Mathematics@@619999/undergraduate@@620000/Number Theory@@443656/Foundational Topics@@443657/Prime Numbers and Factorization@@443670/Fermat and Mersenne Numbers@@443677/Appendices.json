Report only the residue $r$ as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a specific modular exponentiation involving the first Fermat number, $F_1$, and an explanation of how the result relates to Pépin's test for primality.\n\nFirst, we identify the quantities involved. The $n$th Fermat number is defined as $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$. For the case $n=1$, we have:\n$$F_1 = 2^{2^1} + 1 = 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5$$\nThe problem asks for the least non-negative residue $r$ of the expression $3^{(F_1 - 1)/2}$ modulo $F_1$. We substitute the value of $F_1=5$ into this expression. The quantity to compute is:\n$$3^{(5-1)/2} \\pmod{5}$$\nWe first evaluate the exponent:\n$$\\frac{5-1}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$$\nThe modular exponentiation thus simplifies to:\n$$3^2 \\pmod{5}$$\nCalculating the power, we get $3^2 = 9$. Now we find the least non-negative residue of $9$ modulo $5$.\n$$9 = 1 \\cdot 5 + 4$$\nTherefore, $9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. The least non-negative residue is $r=4$.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to explain how this value of $r$ aligns with the characterization for $F_1$ given by Pépin's test. Pépin's test provides a primality condition for Fermat numbers. For an integer $n \\ge 1$, the test states that the Fermat number $F_n$ is prime if and only if the following congruence holds:\n$$3^{(F_n - 1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{F_n}$$\nLet's apply this test to our case, $n=1$. The test asserts that $F_1$ is prime if and only if:\n$$3^{(F_1 - 1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{F_1}$$\nSubstituting $F_1=5$, the condition becomes:\n$$3^{(5-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5}$$\nOur previous calculation showed that $3^{(5-1)/2} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. The condition from Pépin's test is that this residue should be congruent to $-1$ modulo $5$. We can verify that this is indeed the case, as the least non-negative residue of $-1$ modulo $5$ is $4$:\n$$-1 \\equiv -1 + 5 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$$\nSince our computed residue $r=4$ matches the value $-1 \\pmod{5}$, the condition of Pépin's test is satisfied. The test therefore implies that $F_1$ is a prime number. This aligns with the known fact that $F_1 = 5$ is a prime number. The computed value $r=4$ is precisely the value that confirms the primality of $F_1$ according to this characterization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3085141"}, {"introduction": "The Lucas-Lehmer test is a remarkably efficient algorithm for determining the primality of Mersenne numbers, $M_p = 2^p - 1$.
