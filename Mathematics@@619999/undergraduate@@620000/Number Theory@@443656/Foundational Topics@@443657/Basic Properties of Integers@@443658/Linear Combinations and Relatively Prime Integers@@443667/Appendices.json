The integers $a$ and $b$ are given as coprime, which is a necessary condition for the existence of integer solutions to $ax+by=1$, as guaranteed by Bézout's identity. The specific solution $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ is defined as the one that minimizes $|x|$, with a tie-breaking rule that selects the solution with the smaller $|y|$ if multiple pairs yield the same minimal $|x|$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(98765, 43211) = 1$ and find a particular solution $(x_0, y_0)$ using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. We denote $r_0 = a$ and $r_1 = b$.\n\nThe sequence of divisions is as follows:\n$r_0 = 2 r_1 + 12343 \\implies 98765 = 2 \\cdot 43211 + 12343$\n$r_1 = 3 r_2 + 6182 \\implies 43211 = 3 \\cdot 12343 + 6182$\n$r_2 = 1 r_3 + 6161 \\implies 12343 = 1 \\cdot 6182 + 6161$\n$r_3 = 1 r_4 + 21 \\implies 6182 = 1 \\cdot 6161 + 21$\n$r_4 = 293 r_5 + 8 \\implies 6161 = 293 \\cdot 21 + 8$\n$r_5 = 2 r_6 + 5 \\implies 21 = 2 \\cdot 8 + 5$\n$r_6 = 1 r_7 + 3 \\implies 8 = 1 \\cdot 5 + 3$\n$r_7 = 1 r_8 + 2 \\implies 5 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 2$\n$r_8 = 1 r_9 + 1 \\implies 3 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $1$, so $\\gcd(98765, 43211) = 1$, confirming they are coprime.\n\nTo find a particular solution, we must express the final remainder, 1, as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. While this can be done by back-substituting through the division steps, the process is lengthy and prone to error. A more systematic approach is to use the tabular Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nLet $r_i = s_i a + t_i b$.\nFor $i=0$: $r_0 = a = 1 \\cdot a + 0 \\cdot b \\implies s_0 = 1, t_0 = 0$.\nFor $i=1$: $r_1 = b = 0 \\cdot a + 1 \\cdot b \\implies s_1 = 0, t_1 = 1$.\nThe recurrence relation is $(s_{i+1}, t_{i+1}) = (s_{i-1} - q_i s_i, t_{i-1} - q_i t_i)$ where $r_{i-1} = q_i r_i + r_{i+1}$.\nThe quotients are $q_1=2, q_2=3, q_3=1, q_4=1, q_5=293, q_6=2, q_7=1, q_8=1, q_9=1$.\n$s_2 = s_0 - q_1 s_1 = 1-2(0) = 1$, $t_2 = t_0 - q_1 t_1 = 0-2(1)=-2$.\n$s_3 = s_1 - q_2 s_2 = 0-3(1) = -3$, $t_3 = t_1 - q_2 t_2 = 1-3(-2)=7$.\n$s_4 = s_2 - q_3 s_3 = 1-1(-3) = 4$, $t_4 = t_2 - q_3 t_3 = -2-1(7)=-9$.\n$s_5 = s_3 - q_4 s_4 = -3-1(4) = -7$, $t_5 = t_3 - q_4 t_4 = 7-1(-9)=16$.\n$s_6 = s_4 - q_5 s_5 = 4-293(-7) = 2055$, $t_6 = t_4 - q_5 t_5 = -9-293(16)=-4697$.\n$s_7 = s_5 - q_6 s_6 = -7-2(2055) = -4117$, $t_7 = t_5 - q_6 t_6 = 16-2(-4697)=9410$.\n$s_8 = s_6 - q_7 s_7 = 2055-1(-4117) = 6172$, $t_8 = t_6 - q_7 t_7 = -4697-1(9410)=-14107$.\n$s_9 = s_7 - q_8 s_8 = -4117-1(6172) = -10289$, $t_9 = t_7 - q_8 t_8 = 9410-1(-14107)=23517$.\n$s_{10} = s_8 - q_9 s_9 = 6172-1(-10289) = 16461$, $t_{10} = t_8 - q_9 t_9 = -14107-1(23517)=-37624$.\nThis gives the coefficients for $1 = s_{10} a + t_{10} b$.\nSo, a particular solution is $(x_0, y_0) = (16461, -37624)$.\nWe can verify: $98765 \\cdot 16461 + 43211 \\cdot (-37624) = 1625805365 - 1625805364 = 1$. The solution is correct.\n\nThe general solution for $ax + by = 1$ is given by\n$x = x_0 + k \\cdot b = 16461 + k \\cdot 43211$\n$y = y_0 - k \\cdot a = -37624 - k \\cdot 98765$\nfor any integer $k$.\n\nWe must find the integer $k$ that minimizes $|x| = |16461 + 43211k|$. This is equivalent to finding the multiple of $b=43211$ that is closest to $-x_0=-16461$. Let $f(k) = 16461 + 43211k$. We want to find $k$ that minimizes $|f(k)|$.\nWe are looking for $k$ such that $43211k \\approx -16461$, so $k \\approx -16461/43211 \\approx -0.38$.\nThe integers closest to $-0.38$ are $k=0$ and $k=-1$.\nFor $k=0$: $x=16461 + 0 \\cdot 43211 = 16461$. Then $|x|=16461$.\nFor $k=-1$: $x=16461 - 1 \\cdot 43211 = -26750$. Then $|x|=26750$.\nComparing the absolute values, the minimum is $16461$, which occurs at $k=0$.\n\nThe set of solutions for $x$ is the congruence class $x \\equiv 16461 \\pmod{43211}$. We seek the representative of this class with the minimum absolute value. Let $r = 16461$. The candidates are $r$ and $r-b = 16461-43211 = -26750$. The absolute values are $|r|=16461$ and $|r-b|=26750$. A tie for the minimum absolute value would occur only if $|r| = |r-b|$, which implies $r = b/2$. This is possible only if $b$ is an even integer. Since $b = 43211$ is odd, a tie is not possible. The value of $x$ that minimizes $|x|$ is unique.\nSince $16461 < 26750$, the unique solution $x^{\\ast}$ that minimizes $|x|$ is $x^{\\ast}=16461$.\n\nThis corresponds to the choice $k=0$. The corresponding value for $y$ is:\n$y^{\\ast} = -37624 - 0 \\cdot 98765 = -37624$.\nThus, the unique pair $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ that satisfies the given conditions is $(16461, -37624)$. The tie-breaking rule on $|y|$ was not needed.\n\nThe final answer is reported as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n16461 & -37624\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3086858"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can now apply it to solve fundamental problems in number theory.

The Chinese Remainder Theorem asserts that because the moduli are relatively prime, a unique solution for $x$ exists modulo their product, which is $\\text{lcm}(15, 28) = 15 \\times 28 = 420$.\n\nThe prescribed method is to use Bézout's identity, which states that for any two integers $a$ and $b$, there exist integers $u$ and $v$ such that $au + bv = \\gcd(a, b)$. In our case, with $a=15$ and $b=28$, this identity is $15u + 28v = 1$. We can determine the integers $u$ and $v$, known as the Bézout coefficients, by applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nFirst, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of $28$ and $15$:\n$$28 = 1 \\cdot 15 + 13$$\n$$15 = 1 \\cdot 13 + 2$$\n$$13 = 6 \\cdot 2 + 1$$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $1$, confirming that $\\gcd(28, 15) = 1$.\n\nNext, we work backwards through these steps to express $1$ as a linear combination of $28$ and $15$:\nFrom the third equation, we isolate the remainder $1$:\n$$1 = 13 - 6 \\cdot 2$$\nWe substitute the expression for the remainder $2$ from the second equation:\n$$1 = 13 - 6 \\cdot (15 - 1 \\cdot 13)$$\nSimplifying the expression gives:\n$$1 = 13 - 6 \\cdot 15 + 6 \\cdot 13 = 7 \\cdot 13 - 6 \\cdot 15$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the remainder $13$ from the first equation:\n$$1 = 7 \\cdot (28 - 1 \\cdot 15) - 6 \\cdot 15$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the desired linear combination:\n$$1 = 7 \\cdot 28 - 7 \\cdot 15 - 6 \\cdot 15$$\n$$1 = (-13) \\cdot 15 + (7) \\cdot 28$$\nThis is Bézout's identity for $15$ and $28$, with coefficients $u = -13$ (for $a=15$) and $v = 7$ (for $b=28$).\n\nWe can now construct a solution $x$ to the system of congruences.
