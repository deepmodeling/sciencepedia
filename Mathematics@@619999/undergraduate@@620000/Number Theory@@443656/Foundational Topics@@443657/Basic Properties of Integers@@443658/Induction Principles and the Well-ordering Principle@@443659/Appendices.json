A valid counterexample must specify a predicate $P(n)$ and a base value $n_0$ satisfying three conditions:\n    (i) The base case $P(n_0)$ is true.\n    (ii) The implication $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds for infinitely many $k\\ge n_0$ but not for all $k\\ge n_0$.\n    (iii) The conclusion \"$P(n)$ holds for all $n\\ge n_0$\" is false.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is mathematically sound and well-posed. It addresses a fundamental concept in mathematical logic and number theory—the structure of inductive proofs. The language is precise, and the conditions for a counterexample are stated objectively and unambiguously. The problem is a standard, insightful exercise for students of mathematics to test their understanding of the axiomatic basis of induction. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or otherwise flawed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed to analyze each option against the three specified conditions.\n\nThe logical implication $A \\Rightarrow B$ is equivalent to $(\\neg A) \\lor B$. It is false only when $A$ is true and $B$ is false. We will check each proposed counterexample against the three conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\nLet $n_0=1$ and $P(n)$ be the statement \"$n=1$ or $n$ is even.\"\n\n(i) Base Case: We must verify if $P(n_0)$ is true. Here, $n_0=1$. $P(1)$ is the statement \"$1=1$ or $1$ is even.\" Since $1=1$ is true, the disjunction is true. Thus, condition (i) is satisfied.\n\n(iii) Conclusion: We must verify that \"$P(n)$ holds for all $n\\ge 1$\" is false. Consider $n=3$. $P(3)$ is the statement \"$3=1$ or $3$ is even.\" Both parts of the disjunction are false, so $P(3)$ is false. Since there exists an integer $n \\ge 1$ for which $P(n)$ is false, the universal conclusion fails. Thus, condition (iii) is satisfied.\n\n(ii) Inductive Step: We must verify that $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds for infinitely many $k\\ge 1$ but not for all $k\\ge 1$.\n- Let's first check if it fails for some $k$. The implication $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ fails if $P(k)$ is true and $P(k+1)$ is false.\n  - Consider $k=2$. $P(2)$ is \"$2=1$ or $2$ is even,\" which is true. $P(2+1)=P(3)$ is \"$3=1$ or $3$ is even,\" which is false. Since $P(2)$ is true and $P(3)$ is false, the implication $P(2)\\Rightarrow P(3)$ is false. Therefore, the implication does not hold for all $k\\ge 1$.\n- Now, let's check if it holds for infinitely many $k$. The implication $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ is true if $P(k)$ is false or $P(k+1)$ is true.\n  - Consider any odd integer $k  1$. For such $k$, $k \\neq 1$ and $k$ is not even. Thus, $P(k)$ is false. When $P(k)$ is false, the implication $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ is vacuously true.\n  - The set of odd integers greater than $1$ is $\\{3, 5, 7, \\dots\\}$, which is an infinite set.

Here, $n_0=1$. $P(1)$ is the statement \"$1$ is composite.\" By definition, a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than $1$ and itself. The number $1$ has only one divisor ($1$) and is defined as a unit, neither prime nor composite. Thus, $P(1)$ is false.\nCondition (i) is not satisfied.\n\nSince the base case is not true, Option B is not a valid counterexample.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\nLet $n_0=1$ and $P(n)$ be the statement \"$n=1$ or $n\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$.\"\n\n(i) Base Case: We must verify if $P(n_0)$ is true.

Thus, condition (i) is satisfied.\n\n(iii) Conclusion: We must verify that \"$P(n)$ holds for all $n\\ge 1$\" is false. Consider $n=3$. $P(3)$ is the statement \"$3=1$ or $3\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$.\" The statement \"$3=1$\" is false. The statement \"$3\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\" is false because $3$ is a multiple of $3$. Since both parts of the disjunction are false, $P(3)$ is false. The universal conclusion fails. Thus, condition (iii) is satisfied.\n\n(ii) Inductive Step: We must verify that $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds for infinitely many $k\\ge 1$ but not for all $k\\ge 1$.\n- Let's first check for failure. Consider $k=2$. $P(2)$ is \"$2=1$ or $2\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$.\" This is true because $2\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$. $P(2+1)=P(3)$ is false, as shown above. Since $P(2)$ is true and $P(3)$ is false, the implication $P(2)\\Rightarrow P(3)$ is false. It does not hold for all $k\\ge 1$.\n- Now, let's check if it holds for infinitely many $k$. The implication is true if $P(k)$ is false.\n  - $P(k)$ is false if and only if \"$k=1$ or $k\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\" is false. This requires $k \\neq 1$ and $k \\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$.\n  - This is true for all positive multiples of $3$ except $1$ (which is all positive multiples of 3). That is, for $k \\in \\{3, 6, 9, \\dots\\}$. For every such $k$, $P(k)$ is false, making the implication $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ vacuously true.\n  - The set $\\{3, 6, 9, \\dots\\}$ is infinite. Therefore, the implication holds for infinitely many $k \\ge 1$.\n- Both parts of condition (ii) are met.\n\nSince all three conditions are satisfied, Option C is a correct counterexample.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\nThis option presents a theoretical argument rather than a specific predicate $P(n)$. The argument states: \"By the Well-Ordering Principle (WOP), if $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds for infinitely many $k\\ge n_0$, then there cannot be a least $k$ where the implication fails, so the induction conclusion still holds for all $n\\ge n_0$.\"\nThis argument is fallacious. The condition that \"$P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds for infinitely many $k\\ge n_0$\" does not preclude the set of values of $k$ for which the implication fails from being non-empty. If this set of failures is non-empty, the WOP guarantees it has a least element. The standard proof by induction relies on the implication holding for *every* $k \\geq n_0$, which is a much stronger condition. As demonstrated by the valid counterexamples (A and C), it is possible for the weakened hypothesis to hold while the conclusion fails. This option fails to provide a counterexample as requested and makes an incorrect logical claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\nLet $n_0=1$ and $P(n)$ be the statement \"$n=1$ or $n$ is a power of $2$.\" In standard number theory, the powers of $2$ are $\\{2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots\\} = \\{1, 2, 4, \\dots\\}$. Under this definition, the statement is equivalent to \"$n$ is a power of $2$.\"\n\n(i) Base Case: We verify $P(n_0)$ for $n_0=1$. $P(1)$ is \"$1=1$ or $1$ is a power of $2$.\" This is true. Thus, condition (i) is satisfied.\n\n(iii) Conclusion: We must verify that \"$P(n)$ holds for all $n\\ge 1$\" is false. Consider $n=3$. $P(3)$ is \"$3=1$ or $3$ is a power of $2$.\" This is false. The universal conclusion fails. Thus, condition (iii) is satisfied.\n\n(ii) Inductive Step: We must verify that $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds for infinitely many $k\\ge 1$ but not for all $k\\ge 1$.\n- Let's first check for failure. Consider $k=2$. $P(2)$ is true since $2$ is a power of $2$. $P(2+1)=P(3)$ is false. Therefore, the implication $P(2)\\Rightarrow P(3)$ is false. It does not hold for all $k\\ge 1$. In general, for any $k=2^j$ with $j \\ge 1$, $P(k)$ is true. However, $k+1 = 2^j+1$ is an odd number greater than $1$, so it cannot be a power of $2$. Thus $P(k+1)$ is false. This means the implication fails for the infinite set of values $k \\in \\{2, 4, 8, \\dots\\}$.\n- Now, let's check if it holds for infinitely many $k$. The implication is true if $P(k)$ is false.\n  - $P(k)$ is false for any integer $k$ that is not a power of $2$. The set of such integers is $\\{3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, \\dots\\}$, which is an infinite set.\n  - For every $k$ in this infinite set, $P(k)$ is false, so the implication $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ is vacuously true. Therefore, the implication holds for infinitely many $k \\ge 1$.\n- Both parts of condition (ii) are met.\n\nSince all three conditions are satisfied, Option E is a correct counterexample.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nTo summarize, options A, C, and E all successfully construct a counterexample demonstrating that weakening the inductive step invalidates the Principle of Mathematical Induction.

Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Required Base Cases\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the structure of the provided inductive step: $P(k) \\implies P(k+2)$. This step allows us to advance the proof by an increment of $2$, not by the standard increment of $1$.\n\nThis has a crucial consequence: the truth of $P(k)$ only implies the truth of $P(n)$ for integers $n$ that have the same parity as $k$ and are greater than or equal to $k$. For instance, if $k$ is an even number, $k+2$, $k+4$, $k+6$, and so on are all even. If $k$ is an odd number, $k+2$, $k+4$, $k+6$, and so on are all odd. The inductive step never bridges the gap between even and odd integers (or more generally, between integers of the form $n_0 + 2m$ and $n_0 + 1 + 2m$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$).\n\nTo prove that $P(n)$ holds for *all* integers $n \\ge n_0$, we must cover all integers in this range. The set of integers $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n \\ge n_0\\}$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets based on their parity relative to $n_0$:\n1. The set $S_{even} = \\{n \\mid n \\ge n_0 \\text{ and } n \\equiv n_0 \\pmod 2\\} = \\{n_0, n_0+2, n_0+4, \\dots \\}$.\n2. The set $S_{odd} = \\{n \\mid n \\ge n_0 \\text{ and } n \\equiv n_0+1 \\pmod 2\\} = \\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$.\n\nTo prove the statement for all elements in $S_{even}$, we need to establish a base case that \"starts\" this chain of implications. The first element of this set is $n_0$. By proving $P(n_0)$, the inductive step $P(k) \\implies P(k+2)$ ensures that $P(n_0+2)$, $P(n_0+4)$, etc., are all true. Thus, we must prove the base case $P(n_0)$.\n\nSimilarly, to prove the statement for all elements in $S_{odd}$, we need to establish a base case for this second chain. The first element of this set is $n_0+1$. By proving $P(n_0+1)$, the inductive step ensures that $P(n_0+3)$, $P(n_0+5)$, etc., are all true. Thus, we must prove the base case $P(n_0+1)$.\n\nBy proving both $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$, we initiate two separate inductive arguments that, combined, cover all integers $n \\ge n_0$.\n\nLet's formalize this using the Well-Ordering Principle. Let $S = \\{ n \\ge n_0 \\mid P(n) \\text{ is false} \\}$. We assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is non-empty. By the WOP, $S$ has a least element, let's call it $m$. Now, consider the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$ to be proven true.\n- Since $P(n_0)$ is true, $m \\ne n_0$.\n- Since $P(n_0+1)$ is true, $m \\ne n_0+1$.\n- Therefore, we must have $m \\ge n_0+2$.\n- Now consider the integer $k = m-2$. Since $m \\ge n_0+2$, it follows that $k \\ge n_0$.\n- Also, since $k  m$ and $m$ is the *least* element of $S$, $k$ cannot be in $S$. This means $P(k)$ must be true.\n- But we are given the inductive step: $\\forall k \\ge n_0, [P(k) \\implies P(k+2)]$. Since we have established that $k = m-2 \\ge n_0$ and that $P(k)$ is true, this step implies that $P(k+2)$ is true.\n- $P(k+2) = P((m-2)+2) = P(m)$.\n- This leads to the conclusion that $P(m)$ is true, which contradicts the definition of $m$ as an element of $S$ (for which $P(m)$ is false).\n- This contradiction proves that our initial assumption (that $S$ is non-empty) must be false. Therefore, $S$ is empty, and $P(n)$ is true for all $n \\ge n_0$.\nThis argument relies critically on the fact that $m \\ge n_0+2$, which is guaranteed only if both $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$ are established as base cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct setup requires proving the two base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prove the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.**\nAs demonstrated in the derivation above, proving $P(n_0)$ establishes the truth for the sequence $\\{n_0, n_0+2, n_0+4, \\dots \\}$, and proving $P(n_0+1)$ establishes the truth for the sequence $\\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$. Together, these cover all integers $n \\ge n_0$. This is the necessary and sufficient set of base cases.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Prove the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+2)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.**\nIf one proves $P(n_0)$, the given inductive step with $k=n_0$ already implies $P(n_0+2)$. So, proving $P(n_0+2)$ is redundant. Most importantly, this choice of base cases provides no starting point for the sequence $\\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$. The truth of $P(n)$ for any $n$ in this sequence cannot be inferred.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Prove the base cases $P(n_0+1)$ and $P(n_0+3)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.**\nThis choice fails to prove the statement for $n=n_0$, which is the very first value in the required range $n \\ge n_0$. It also fails to prove the statement for $n_0+2, n_0+4$, etc. This approach only proves $P(n)$ for $n \\in \\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Prove only the base case $P(n_0)$, and then use strong induction to deduce $P(n)$ for all $n\\ge n_0$ from the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$.**\nProving only $P(n_0)$ is insufficient. It only allows the proof to proceed for the sequence $\\{n_0, n_0+2, n_0+4, \\dots \\}$. No information is provided to prove $P(n_0+1)$. The invocation of \"strong induction\" does not alter this, because the given implication is only from $P(k)$ to $P(k+2)$. In the strong induction framework, to prove $P(k+1)$, one assumes $P(j)$ for all $n_0 \\le j \\le k$. However, the given step does not provide a link from any of these prior statements to $P(k+1)$. Specifically, to prove $P(n_0+1)$, one could only assume $P(n_0)$, but the step $P(n_0) \\Rightarrow P(n_0+2)$ is of no help.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E.

Proving $P(n_0+3)$ establishes the truth for $\\{n_0+3, n_0+5, n_0+7, \\dots \\}$. This leaves the case $n=n_0+1$ unproven.

The complete induction (strong induction) principle with base index $n_0$ is: If $P(n_0)$ holds and for all $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $k\\ge n_0$, the implication $\\big(P(n_0)\\land P(n_0+1)\\land \\cdots \\land P(k)\\big)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$.**\n\nThis statement describes the principle of complete (or strong) induction. Let's analyze its structure.\nThe premises are:\n1.  $P(n_0)$ is true (the base case).\n2.  For any integer $k \\ge n_0$, if $P(j)$ is true for all integers $j$ from $n_0$ to $k$, then $P(k+1)$ is true. This can be written formally as:\n    $$ \\forall k \\ge n_0 \\left[ \\left( \\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{k} P(j) \\right) \\Rightarrow P(k+1) \\right] $$\nThe conclusion is that $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n \\ge n_0$.\n\nThis is a correct formulation of the principle of complete induction. The base case $P(n_0)$ establishes the starting point. The inductive step then allows one to proceed from the truth of the property for all integers up to $k$ to the truth of the property for $k+1$. For the very first step of the induction after the base case (i.e., for $k=n_0$), the implication becomes $P(n_0) \\Rightarrow P(n_0+1)$. Since $P(n_0)$ is given as true, we can deduce $P(n_0+1)$. For the next step ($k=n_0+1$), the implication is $(P(n_0) \\land P(n_0+1)) \\Rightarrow P(n_0+2)$. Since we have now established both $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$, we can deduce $P(n_0+2)$, and so on. The statement accurately captures this logical progression.\n\nVerdict for A: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The (weak) principle of mathematical induction with base index $n_0$ is: If $P(n_0)$ holds and for all $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $k\\ge n_0$, the implication $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$.**\n\nThis statement describes the standard principle of mathematical induction (PMI), sometimes called \"weak\" induction to distinguish it from complete induction.\nThe premises are:\n1.  $P(n_0)$ is true (the base case).\n2.  For any integer $k \\ge n_0$, if $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k+1)$ is true (the inductive step). Formally:\n    $$ \\forall k \\ge n_0 [P(k) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)] $$\nThe conclusion is that $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n \\ge n_0$.\n\nThis is the canonical definition of the principle of mathematical induction.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Over $\\mathbb{N}$, complete induction proves strictly more statements than weak induction; that is, there exist properties $P$ for which complete induction succeeds while weak induction fails.**\n\nThis statement claims that complete induction is logically stronger than weak induction. This is a common misconception. The two principles are, in fact, logically equivalent over the natural numbers.\n\n1.  **Complete Induction implies Weak Induction**: This is straightforward. If a proof requires only the assumption $P(k)$ to show $P(k+1)$ (as in weak induction), it will certainly still be valid under the stronger assumption that $P(j)$ holds for all $j$ from $n_0$ to $k$. The weak induction hypothesis $P(k)$ is a subset of the strong induction hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Weak Induction implies Complete Induction**: Let's assume weak induction (PMI) holds. We want to show that complete induction holds. Let $P(n)$ be a property. The premise of complete induction is that for any $k \\ge n_0$, $(\\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{k-1} P(j)) \\Rightarrow P(k)$. (This alternate but equivalent formulation is slightly cleaner for the proof). We want to conclude that $P(n)$ holds for all $n \\ge n_0$.\n    Let us define a new property $Q(n)$ as $Q(n) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{n} P(j)$. We will prove that $Q(n)$ holds for all $n \\ge n_0$ using weak induction.\n    -   **Base Case for $Q(n)$**: We must prove $Q(n_0)$, which is just $P(n_0)$. The premise of complete induction applied to $k=n_0$ is $(\\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{n_0-1} P(j)) \\Rightarrow P(n_0)$. The antecedent is a conjunction over an empty set, which is vacuously true. Thus, the premise of complete induction requires that $P(n_0)$ be provable. So $Q(n_0)$ holds.\n    -   **Inductive Step for $Q(n)$**: Assume $Q(k)$ holds for some $k \\ge n_0$. This means $\\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{k} P(j)$ is true. By the premise of complete induction (with $k+1$ in place of $k$), we have $(\\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{k} P(j)) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)$. Since we assumed the antecedent $Q(k) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{k} P(j)$ is true, we can conclude that $P(k+1)$ is true.\n    Combining $Q(k)$ (i.e., $P(j)$ is true for $n_0 \\le j \\le k$) and our new finding that $P(k+1)$ is true, we get that $P(j)$ is true for $n_0 \\le j \\le k+1$. This is precisely the statement $Q(k+1)$. So, we have shown $Q(k) \\Rightarrow Q(k+1)$.\n    By the principle of weak induction (PMI), $Q(n)$ is true for all $n \\ge n_0$.\n    If $Q(n) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{j=n_0}^{n} P(j)$ is true for all $n \\ge n_0$, then for any particular $n$, a constituent part of the conjunction, $P(n)$, must be true. Thus, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \\ge n_0$.\n\nSince each principle implies the other, they are logically equivalent. They can prove exactly the same set of theorems about the natural numbers. The choice between them is one of convenience for the structure of a specific proof.\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The well-ordering principle (WOP) for $\\mathbb{N}$ implies the complete induction (strong induction) principle.**\n\nThis is a standard theorem. We assume WOP is true and use it to prove complete induction.\nLet the hypotheses of complete induction be satisfied for a property $P(n)$ and base index $n_0$. That is, for any $k \\ge n_0$, if $P(j)$ holds for all $j$ with $n_0 \\le j  k$, then $P(k)$ holds. We want to show that $P(n)$ holds for all $n \\ge n_0$.\nLet's use proof by contradiction. Assume the conclusion is false. Then the set $S = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\ge n_0 \\text{ and } P(n) \\text{ is false} \\}$ is non-empty.\nBy the WOP, since $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$, it must have a least element. Let's call this element $m$.\nSo, $m$ is the smallest integer $\\ge n_0$ such that $P(m)$ is false.\nBy the definition of $m$:\n1.  $m \\ge n_0$ and $P(m)$ is false.\n2.  For any integer $j$ such that $n_0 \\le j  m$, $P(j)$ must be true (because $m$ is the *least* counterexample).\nNow, consider the inductive hypothesis of complete induction for the specific case where $k=m$. The hypothesis states: \"if $P(j)$ holds for all $j$ with $n_0 \\le j  m$, then $P(m)$ holds\".\nFrom point (2) above, we know that the premise of this implication, \"$P(j)$ holds for all $j$ with $n_0 \\le j  m$\", is true.\nTherefore, the conclusion of the implication, \"$P(m)$ holds\", must also be true.\nThis leads to a contradiction: we have concluded that $P(m)$ is true, but we defined $m$ to be an element for which $P(m)$ is false.\nThe assumption that the set $S$ is non-empty must be false. Therefore, $S$ is empty. This means there are no natural numbers $n \\ge n_0$ for which $P(n)$ is false. In other words, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \\ge n_0$.\nThis completes the proof that WOP implies complete induction.\n\nVerdict for D: **Correct**.\n\n**E. The complete induction (strong induction) principle implies the well-ordering principle (WOP) for $\\mathbb{N}$.**\n\nThis is also a standard theorem, establishing the full equivalence of these principles. We assume complete induction holds and use it to prove WOP.\nWOP states that any non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ has a least element.\nIt is easier to prove the contrapositive: If a subset $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ has no least element, then $S$ must be empty.\nLet $S$ be a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ that has no least element. We will use complete induction to prove the property $P(n)$ defined as \"$n \\notin S$\" for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (we can set $n_0=0$ or $n_0=1$ depending on the definition of $\\mathbb{N}$). Let's assume $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ and set $n_0=1$.\nWe want to prove $P(n)$ for all $n \\ge 1$ using complete induction. We must show that for any $k \\ge 1$, if $P(j)$ holds for all $j$ with $1 \\le j  k$, then $P(k)$ holds.\nSo, let $k \\ge 1$ be an arbitrary integer. Assume the inductive hypothesis: $P(j)$ is true for all $j$ such that $1 \\le j  k$. This means that for all $j  k$, $j \\notin S$.\nWe want to prove $P(k)$, which means we want to show $k \\notin S$.\nIf $k$ were in $S$, then since no integer $j  k$ is in $S$, $k$ would be the least element of $S$.\nBut we started with the premise that $S$ has no least element. This is a contradiction.\nSo, the assumption that $k \\in S$ must be false. Therefore, $k \\notin S$, which means $P(k)$ is true.\nWe have successfully established the inductive step of complete induction.\nBy the principle of complete induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \\ge 1$. This means $n \\notin S$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nThis implies that the set $S$ is empty.\nWe have thus proven that if a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ has no least element, it must be empty. This is the contrapositive of the WOP, so the WOP is true.\n\nVerdict for E: **Correct**.\n\n**F. In complete induction with base index $n_0$, one must verify $P(n_0), P(n_0+1), \\dots, P(n_0+r)$ for arbitrarily large $r\\in\\mathbb{N}$ before the inductive step applies; otherwise the method is invalid.**\n\nThis statement is a mischaracterization of how complete induction works. The power of induction (both weak and complete) lies in the fact that one only needs to prove a finite number of base cases and a single, general inductive step to establish the property for an infinite number of cases.\nIn some proofs using complete induction, it is necessary to establish more than one base case. This typically happens when the proof for $P(k)$ depends on the truth of the property for values that are more than one step back, e.g., $P(k-m)$ for some fixed $m1$. In such a scenario, one would need to establish the base cases $P(n_0), P(n_0+1), \\dots, P(n_0+m-1)$ individually, so that the inductive step is valid for all $k \\ge n_0+m$.\nHowever, the number of base cases required, $m$, is a fixed, finite number determined by the logical structure of the inductive step. It is not \"arbitrarily large\". The phrase \"arbitrarily large $r$\" implies that for any integer $r$ one chooses, one must verify $r+1$ cases, which would require an infinite number of preliminary checks and would defeat the purpose of induction.\n\nVerdict for F: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Summary of Correct Statements\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A, B, D, and E are correct.\n- A is a valid statement of complete induction.\n- B is a valid statement of weak induction.\n- D states that WOP implies complete induction, which is true.\n- E states that complete induction implies WOP, which is also true.\n\nStatements C and F are incorrect.\n- C incorrectly claims complete induction is strictly stronger than weak induction.\n- F incorrectly describes the nature of base cases in complete induction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "3086077"}]}
