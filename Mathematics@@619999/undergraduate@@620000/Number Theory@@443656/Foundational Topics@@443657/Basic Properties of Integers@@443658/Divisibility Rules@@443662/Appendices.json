We are interested in determining if $N$ is divisible by $m$, which is equivalent to checking if $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod m$.\n\nWe start from the definition of $N$ and consider its value modulo $m$. Using the fundamental properties of modular arithmetic, namely that congruence is preserved under addition and multiplication, we can write:\n$$N \\equiv \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{t} d_k b^k\\right) \\pmod m$$\n$$N \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{t} (d_k b^k \\pmod m) \\pmod m$$\n$$N \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{t} ((d_k \\pmod m) \\cdot (b^k \\pmod m)) \\pmod m$$\nSince the digits $d_k$ are integers, we can simplify this to:\n$$N \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{t} d_k (b^k \\pmod m) \\pmod m$$\nWe define a sequence of weights, $w_k$, as the least non-negative residues of the powers of the base $b$ modulo $m$:\n$$w_k = b^k \\pmod m, \\quad \\text{for } k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nWith this definition, the congruence for $N$ becomes:\n$$N \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{t} d_k w_k \\pmod m$$\nThis equation establishes that an integer $N$ is congruent to the weighted sum of its digits modulo $m$. Therefore, $N$ is divisible by $m$ if and only if this weighted sum, $\\sum_{k=0}^{t} d_k w_k$, is divisible by $m$. This is the foundation of the divisibility test.\n\nNext, we address the periodicity of the weights. The problem defines $r$ as the multiplicative order of $b$ modulo $m$, which is the least positive integer such that $b^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$. The existence of $r$ is guaranteed by the given condition $\\gcd(b, m)=1$.\nLet's analyze the sequence of weights $\\{w_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}$. For any non-negative integer $k$, consider the weight $w_{k+r}$:\n$$w_{k+r} = b^{k+r} \\pmod m = (b^k \\cdot b^r) \\pmod m$$\nBy the property of modular multiplication, this is congruent to:\n$$w_{k+r} \\equiv ( (b^k \\pmod m) \\cdot (b^r \\pmod m) ) \\pmod m$$\nSubstituting $w_k = b^k \\pmod m$ and using the definition of $r$, $b^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$, we get:\n$$w_{k+r} \\equiv (w_k \\cdot 1) \\pmod m \\equiv w_k \\pmod m$$\nSince both $w_k$ and $w_{k+r}$ are defined as the least non-negative residues, they must be in the range $[0, m-1]$. Their congruence modulo $m$ thus implies equality: $w_{k+r} = w_k$. This demonstrates that the sequence of weights is periodic with period $r$.\n\nTo prove that $r$ is the minimal period, we assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is a smaller positive integer $p$ (with $0 < p < r$) that is also a period for the sequence of weights. If $p$ is a period, then $w_{k+p} = w_k$ for all $k \\geq 0$. For the specific case where $k=0$, this implies $w_p = w_0$. We know that $w_0 = b^0 \\pmod m = 1$, and $w_p = b^p \\pmod m$. Thus, $b^p \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$. This, however, contradicts the definition of $r$ as the *least positive* integer for which this congruence holds, given that we assumed $p < r$. Therefore, our assumption of a smaller period $p$ must be false, and $r$ is the minimal period of the sequence of weights.\n\nThe periodic nature of the weights, $w_k = w_{k \\pmod r}$, allows us to write the congruence for $N$ as:\n$$N \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{t} d_k w_{k \\pmod r} \\pmod m$$\nThis confirms that the divisibility test only requires the finite set of $r$ weights $\\{w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{r-1}\\}$, which are applied cyclically to the digits of $N$ from right to left (from least significant to most significant).\n\nWe now specialize to the case $b=12$ and $m=7$. We first verify that $\\gcd(12, 7) = 1$, which is true. Our task is to find the multiplicative order $r$ of $12$ modulo $7$. We note that $12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 7$. Thus, we need to find the smallest positive integer $r$ such that $5^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$. We compute the powers of $5$ modulo $7$:\n$5^1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 7$\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$\n$5^3 = 5^2 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 4 \\cdot 5 = 20 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 7$\n$5^4 = 5^3 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 6 \\cdot 5 = 30 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$\n$5^5 = 5^4 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5 = 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7$\n$5^6 = 5^5 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 5 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$\nThe smallest positive power $r$ yielding a residue of $1$ is $6$. Therefore, the minimal period is $r=6$.\n\nThe minimal-period weight-sum test for divisibility by $7$ for base-$12$ numbers uses a repeating pattern of $6$ weights. These weights, $w_k = 12^k \\pmod 7$, for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 5\\}$, are:\n$w_0 = 12^0 \\pmod 7 = 1$\n$w_1 = 12^1 \\pmod 7 = 5$\n$w_2 = 12^2 \\pmod 7 \\equiv 5^2 \\pmod 7 = 4$\n$w_3 = 12^3 \\pmod 7 \\equiv 5^3 \\pmod 7 = 6$\n$w_4 = 12^4 \\pmod 7 \\equiv 5^4 \\pmod 7 = 2$\n$w_5 = 12^5 \\pmod 7 \\equiv 5^5 \\pmod 7 = 3$\nThe sequence of weights that repeats is $(1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3)$.\nFor a number $N = (d_t \\dots d_1 d_0)_{12}$, it is divisible by $7$ if and only if the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{t} d_k w_k$ is divisible by $7$, where the weights are applied with period $6$.
