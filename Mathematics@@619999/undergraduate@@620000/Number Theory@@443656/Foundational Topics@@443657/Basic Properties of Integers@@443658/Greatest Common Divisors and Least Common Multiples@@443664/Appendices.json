We are asked to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, $a = 123456$ and $b = 7890$, and to justify the correctness of the Euclidean algorithm used for this computation.\n\nThe justification hinges on a fundamental property derived from the division algorithm. Let $x$ and $y$ be integers with $y \\neq 0$. The division algorithm states the existence of unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that $x = qy + r$ with $0 \\le r < |y|$. The core principle of the Euclidean algorithm is that the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $y$ and $r$. In symbols, $\\gcd(x, y) = \\gcd(y, r)$.\n\nTo prove this from first principles, we must show that the set of common divisors of $x$ and $y$ is identical to the set of common divisors of $y$ and $r$. Let $C(u, v)$ denote the set of common divisors for integers $u$ and $v$. We need to demonstrate that $C(x, y) = C(y, r)$.\n\nFirst, let $d$ be a common divisor of $x$ and $y$. This means $d|x$ and $d|y$. From the division algorithm equation, we can write the remainder as $r = x - qy$. Since $d|x$ and $d|y$, $d$ must also divide any integer linear combination of $x$ and $y$, including $x - qy$. Therefore, $d|r$. Because $d$ already divides $y$, $d$ is a common divisor of $y$ and $r$. This shows that any element of $C(x, y)$ is also an element of $C(y, r)$, so $C(x, y) \\subseteq C(y, r)$.\n\nSecond, let $d'$ be a common divisor of $y$ and $r$. This means $d'|y$ and $d'|r$. From the equation $x = qy + r$, we see that since $d'|y$ and $d'|r$, $d'$ must also divide the linear combination $qy + r$. Therefore, $d'|x$. Because $d'$ already divides $y$, $d'$ is a common divisor of $x$ and $y$. This shows that any element of $C(y, r)$ is also an element of $C(x, y)$, so $C(y, r) \\subseteq C(x, y)$.\n\nSince $C(x, y) \\subseteq C(y, r)$ and $C(y, r) \\subseteq C(x, y)$, the two sets must be equal: $C(x, y) = C(y, r)$. As the sets of common divisors are identical, their greatest elements must also be identical. Thus, $\\gcd(x, y) = \\gcd(y, r)$.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is the successive application of this principle. Given $r_0 = a$ and $r_1 = b$, we generate a sequence of remainders $r_2, r_3, \\dots, r_{n+1}$ where $r_{i-1} = q_i r_i + r_{i+1}$ for $i \\ge 1$ and $0 \\le r_{i+1} < r_i$. This sequence of remainders is strictly decreasing and non-negative, so it must eventually reach a remainder of $0$. Let $r_{n+1} = 0$. The last non-zero remainder, $r_n$, is the GCD of $a$ and $b$. This follows from the chain of equalities:\n$\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(r_0, r_1) = \\gcd(r_1, r_2) = \\dots = \\gcd(r_{n-1}, r_n) = \\gcd(r_n, r_{n+1}) = \\gcd(r_n, 0)$.\nThe greatest common divisor of any non-zero integer $k$ and $0$ is $|k|$, because every non-zero integer divides $0$.

The problem provides the prime factorizations $a = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{2}$ and $b = 2^{3} \\cdot 3^{7}$. The $p$-adic valuation $v_p(n)$ is defined as the exponent of the prime $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\nFirst, we determine the $p$-adic valuations for the greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(a,b)$. Let $d = \\gcd(a,b)$. By definition, $d$ must divide both $a$ and $b$. The condition that an integer $x$ divides an integer $y$ (denoted $x|y$) is equivalent to the condition that for every prime $p$, the $p$-adic valuation of $x$ is less than or equal to the $p$-adic valuation of $y$. Formally, $x|y \\iff v_p(x) \\le v_p(y)$ for all primes $p$.\nFor $d$ to be a common divisor of $a$ and $b$, we must have $d|a$ and $d|b$. This implies:\n$v_p(d) \\le v_p(a)$ for all primes $p$.\n$v_p(d) \\le v_p(b)$ for all primes $p$.\nCombining these two conditions, we have $v_p(d) \\le \\min(v_p(a), v_p(b))$ for all primes $p$.\nSince $\\gcd(a,b)$ is the *greatest* common divisor, its value must be maximized. This is achieved by maximizing each of its $p$-adic valuations. Therefore, we must choose the equality:\n$$v_p(\\gcd(a,b)) = \\min(v_p(a), v_p(b))$$\nFrom the given factorizations, we have $v_2(a)=5$, $v_3(a)=2$, and $v_p(a)=0$ for $p \\notin \\{2, 3\\}$. Similarly, $v_2(b)=3$, $v_3(b)=7$, and $v_p(b)=0$ for $p \\notin \\{2, 3\\}$.\nApplying the formula for the valuations of the $\\gcd$:\n$v_{2}(\\gcd(a,b)) = \\min(v_2(a), v_2(b)) = \\min(5, 3) = 3$.\n$v_{3}(\\gcd(a,b)) = \\min(v_3(a), v_3(b)) = \\min(2, 7) = 2$.\nFor any prime $p$ not equal to $2$ or $3$, $v_p(\\gcd(a,b)) = \\min(0, 0) = 0$.\n\nNext, we determine the $p$-adic valuations for the least common multiple, $\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)$. Let $m = \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)$. By definition, $m$ must be a multiple of both $a$ and $b$. This means $a|m$ and $b|m$. In terms of $p$-adic valuations:\n$v_p(a) \\le v_p(m)$ for all primes $p$.\n$v_p(b) \\le v_p(m)$ for all primes $p$.\nCombining these gives $v_p(m) \\ge \\max(v_p(a), v_p(b))$ for all primes $p$.\nSince $\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)$ is the *least* positive common multiple, its value must be minimized. This is achieved by minimizing each of its $p$-adic valuations. Thus, we must choose the equality:\n$$v_p(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)) = \\max(v_p(a), v_p(b))$$\nApplying this formula with the given valuations:\n$v_{2}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)) = \\max(v_2(a), v_2(b)) = \\max(5, 3) = 5$.\n$v_{3}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)) = \\max(v_3(a), v_3(b)) = \\max(2, 7) = 7$.\nFor any prime $p$ not equal to $2$ or $3$, $v_p(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)) = \\max(0, 0) = 0$.\n\nUsing these valuations, we can construct the integers $\\gcd(a,b)$ and $\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)$:\n$\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{v_{2}(\\gcd(a,b))} \\cdot 3^{v_{3}(\\gcd(a,b))} = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = 8 \\cdot 9 = 72$.\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = 2^{v_{2}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b))} \\cdot 3^{v_{3}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b))} = 2^5 \\cdot 3^7 = 32 \\cdot 2187 = 69984$.\n\nThe problem requires a verification from first principles.\n**Verification of $\\gcd(a,b) = 72$**:\nLet $d = 72$.

Let $c$ be any positive common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Since $c|a$ and $c|b$, the prime factors of $c$ can only be $2$ and $3$. Let $c=2^x 3^y$.\n$c | a \\implies v_2(c) \\le v_2(a) \\text{ and } v_3(c) \\le v_3(a) \\implies x \\le 5 \\text{ and } y \\le 2$.\n$c | b \\implies v_2(c) \\le v_2(b) \\text{ and } v_3(c) \\le v_3(b) \\implies x \\le 3 \\text{ and } y \\le 7$.\nFor $c$ to be a common divisor, both conditions on its exponents must be met.

Therefore, any common divisor $c$ is less than or equal to $72$, establishing that $72$ is the greatest common divisor.\n\n**Verification of $\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = 69984$**:\nLet $m=69984$. First, we confirm $m$ is a common multiple.\n$\\frac{m}{a} = \\frac{2^5 \\cdot 3^7}{2^5 \\cdot 3^2} = 3^5 = 243$, which is an integer. Thus, $a|m$.\n$\\frac{m}{b} = \\frac{2^5 \\cdot 3^7}{2^3 \\cdot 3^7} = 2^2 = 4$, which is an integer. Thus, $b|m$.\nSo, $69984$ is a common multiple.\nNext, we show it is the least. Let $k$ be any positive common multiple of $a$ and $b$. Let the prime factorization of $k$ be $k = 2^x 3^y \\dots$.\n$a | k \\implies v_2(a) \\le v_2(k) \\text{ and } v_3(a) \\le v_3(k) \\implies 5 \\le x \\text{ and } 2 \\le y$.\n$b | k \\implies v_2(b) \\le v_2(k) \\text{ and } v_3(b) \\le v_3(k) \\implies 3 \\le x \\text{ and } 7 \\le y$.\nFor $k$ to be a common multiple, both conditions on its exponents must be met. Thus, $x \\ge \\max(5,3) = 5$ and $y \\ge \\max(2,7) = 7$.\nTo form the smallest positive integer $k$, we must choose the minimum possible exponents, which are $x=5$ and $y=7$, and have no other prime factors.\nThis gives the integer $2^5 \\cdot 3^7 = 69984$. Therefore, any positive common multiple $k$ is greater than or equal to $69984$, establishing that $69984$ is the least common multiple.\n\nThe final numerical results are:\n$v_{2}(\\gcd(a,b)) = 3$\n$v_{3}(\\gcd(a,b)) = 2$\n$v_{2}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)) = 5$\n$v_{3}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)) = 7$\n$\\gcd(a,b) = 72$\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = 69984$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 5 & 7 & 72 & 69984 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3085692"}, {"introduction": "A true test of understanding is the ability to synthesize different methods and apply them to new situations.

A fundamental property of the greatest common divisor is that any common divisor of two integers must also divide their greatest common divisor. Therefore, since $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$, it must divide $g = \\gcd(a,b)$. So, $d|g$.\nWe also know from the definition of $d$ that $d|c$.\nSince $d|g$ and $d|c$, $d$ is a common divisor of $g$ and $c$.\nApplying the same property again, $d$ must divide $\\gcd(g,c)$, which is $d'$. So, $d|d'$.\n\nSince $d$ and $d'$ are positive integers and $d|d'$, it must be that $d \\le d'$.\nCombining the two inequalities $d' \\le d$ and $d \\le d'$, we conclude that $d = d'$.

This implies:\n$2 \\le f_2$, $1 \\le f_2$, and $1 \\le f_2 \\implies f_2 \\ge \\max(2,1,1) = 2$.\n$1 \\le f_3$, $2 \\le f_3$, and $1 \\le f_3 \\implies f_3 \\ge \\max(1,2,1) = 2$.\n$0 \\le f_5$, $0 \\le f_5$, and $1 \\le f_5 \\implies f_5 \\ge \\max(0,0,1) = 1$.\n$1 \\le f_7$, $1 \\le f_7$, and $1 \\le f_7 \\implies f_7 \\ge \\max(1,1,1) = 1$.\nTo make $m$ the *least* common multiple, we must choose the smallest possible exponents, which are the maximums themselves.\nThus, $m = 2^{\\max(2,1,1)} \\cdot 3^{\\max(1,2,1)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(0,0,1)} \\cdot 7^{\\max(1,1,1)} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 1260$.\n\n**Part 3: Reconciliation of Results**\n\nThe value for $\\gcd(84, 126, 210)$ is $42$ from both the Euclidean algorithm and the prime factorization method. The agreement is obligatory: both methods are logically sound procedures derived from the same fundamental definition of a greatest common divisor. The Euclidean algorithm provides an efficient computational path, while prime factorization offers a structural view based on the integers' multiplicative building blocks. Since both correctly implement the definition, they must yield the same unique result.\n\nThe problem asks to reconcile the LCM result as well. While the Euclidean algorithm does not directly compute the LCM, it facilitates its calculation through the well-known identity for two positive integers $x,y$: $\\gcd(x,y) \\cdot \\operatorname{lcm}(x,y) = x \\cdot y$. As requested, we justify this identity using prime-power exponents.\nLet $x = \\prod_i p_i^{\\alpha_i}$ and $y = \\prod_i p_i^{\\beta_i}$.\n$\\gcd(x,y) = \\prod_i p_i^{\\min(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i)}$\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y) = \\prod_i p_i^{\\max(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i)}$\nThe product is $\\gcd(x,y) \\cdot \\operatorname{lcm}(x,y) = \\prod_i p_i^{\\min(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i) + \\max(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i)}$.\nFor any pair of real numbers $\\alpha_i, \\beta_i$, the identity $\\min(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i) + \\max(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i) = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i$ holds.\nTherefore, $\\prod_i p_i^{\\min(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i) + \\max(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i)} = \\prod_i p_i^{\\alpha_i + \\beta_i} = (\\prod_i p_i^{\\alpha_i}) \\cdot (\\prod_i p_i^{\\beta_i}) = x \\cdot y$. This justifies the identity.\n\nUsing this identity, we can compute $\\operatorname{lcm}(84, 126, 210)$ by iterating: $\\operatorname{lcm}(84, 126, 210) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{lcm}(84, 126), 210)$. The associativity of LCM can be proven in a manner analogous to that for GCD.\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(84, 126) = \\frac{84 \\cdot 126}{\\gcd(84, 126)} = \\frac{84 \\cdot 126}{42} = 2 \\cdot 126 = 252$.\nNext, we compute $\\operatorname{lcm}(252, 210) = \\frac{252 \\cdot 210}{\\gcd(252, 210)}$.\nWe find $\\gcd(252, 210)$ using the Euclidean algorithm:\n$252 = 1 \\cdot 210 + 42$\n$210 = 5 \\cdot 42 + 0$\nSo, $\\gcd(252, 210) = 42$.\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(252, 210) = \\frac{252 \\cdot 210}{42} = 252 \\cdot 5 = 1260$.\nThis value of $1260$ matches the result from the prime factorization method. This confirms that the procedural calculation of LCM, which relies on the GCD from the Euclidean algorithm, is consistent with the structural calculation from prime factorizations.\n\nIn summary, for the given integers $(84,126,210)$, we have found:\n- $\\gcd(84, 126, 210) = 42$\n- $\\operatorname{lcm}(84, 126, 210) = 1260$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n42 & 1260\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3085690"}]}
