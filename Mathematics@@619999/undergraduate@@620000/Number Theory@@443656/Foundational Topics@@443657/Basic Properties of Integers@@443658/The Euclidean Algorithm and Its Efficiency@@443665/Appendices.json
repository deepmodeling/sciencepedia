The Euclidean algorithm is a classic method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. Its efficiency is often measured by the number of division steps it takes to terminate. It has been observed that consecutive Fibonacci numbers represent a \"worst-case\" input scenario for the algorithm, requiring a relatively large number of steps compared to the magnitude of the numbers.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 2$, with the initial values $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$.\n\nYou are tasked with analyzing a specific instance of this behavior.

Finally, characterize in general all integer pairs $(x,y)$ at which this minimum positive value is achieved in terms of $a$, $b$, and the output of the extended Euclidean algorithm. Your final answer should be the single minimal positive value for the given $a$ and $b$ as an exact integer with no rounding.", "solution": "The problem asks for a multi-part analysis concerning the set of integer linear combinations of two integers $a$ and $b$. Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, not both zero. The set in question is $S = \\{ |ax+by| : x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\nFirst, we address the existence of a minimal positive element in $S$. Let us define a related set $S' = \\{ ax+by : x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ and } ax+by > 0 \\}$. This set $S'$ is the set of all positive integer values that can be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. To show that $S'$ has a minimal element, we must first establish that a positive element exists, i.e., that $S'$ is non-empty. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, at least one of them is non-zero. Without loss of generality, assume $a \\neq 0$. By choosing $x=a$ and $y=0$, we obtain the linear combination $a(a) + b(0) = a^2$. Since $a$ is a non-zero integer, $a^2$ is a positive integer. Thus, $a^2 \\in S'$, which proves that $S'$ is a non-empty set of positive integers. By the Well-Ordering Principle, any non-empty set of positive integers must have a least element. Therefore, $S'$ possesses a minimal element. Let this minimal positive element be denoted by $d$. The minimal positive element of $S$ is, by definition, this same value $d$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that this minimal positive element $d$ is precisely the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\gcd(a,b)$, and that the Euclidean algorithm finds this value. By definition of $d$ as the minimal positive element of $S'$, there exist integers $x_0$ and $y_0$ such that $d = ax_0 + by_0$. We now use the division algorithm to show that $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$. Any integer, including $a$, can be written in terms of $d$ as $a = qd + r$, where $q$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder satisfying $0 \\le r  d$. We can express the remainder $r$ as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$:\n$$ r = a - qd = a - q(ax_0 + by_0) = a(1-qx_0) + b(-qy_0) $$\nThis expression shows that $r$ is an element of the set of linear combinations $\\{ax+by\\}$. Since $0 \\le r  d$ and $d$ is defined as the *minimal positive* linear combination, the remainder $r$ cannot be a positive integer. The only possibility is that $r=0$. If $r=0$, then $a = qd$, which means $d$ divides $a$. By an identical argument, $d$ must also divide $b$. Therefore, $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$.\n\nNow, let $c$ be any arbitrary common divisor of $a$ and $b$. This means $a = ck$ and $b = cl$ for some integers $k$ and $l$. Substituting these into the expression for $d$:\n$$ d = ax_0 + by_0 = (ck)x_0 + (cl)y_0 = c(kx_0 + ly_0) $$\nThis shows that any common divisor $c$ must divide $d$. A common divisor $d$ that is divisible by every other common divisor $c$ is, by definition, the greatest common divisor. Thus, $d = \\gcd(a,b)$. This result is known as Bézout's identity.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a procedure that computes the greatest common divisor of two integers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. It generates a sequence of remainders $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$ where $r_{n}$ is the last non-zero remainder. A fundamental property of the algorithm is that $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(b, r_1) = \\ldots = \\gcd(r_{n-1}, r_n) = \\gcd(r_n, 0) = r_n$. Since we have proven that the minimal positive value of $|ax+by|$ is $\\gcd(a,b)$, the Euclidean algorithm directly computes this value. The efficiency of the algorithm is notable; the number of steps required is logarithmic with respect to the size of the smaller input integer, a result established by Lamé's theorem. This guarantees a rapid computation even for very large numbers.\n\nWe now apply the Euclidean algorithm to the specific integers $a=31784$ and $b=19532$.\n\\begin{align*} 31784 = 1 \\cdot 19532 + 12252 \\\\ 19532 = 1 \\cdot 12252 + 7280 \\\\ 12252 = 1 \\cdot 7280 + 4972 \\\\ 7280 = 1 \\cdot 4972 + 2308 \\\\ 4972 = 2 \\cdot 2308 + 356 \\\\ 2308 = 6 \\cdot 356 + 172 \\\\ 356 = 2 \\cdot 172 + 12 \\\\ 172 = 14 \\cdot 12 + 4 \\\\ 12 = 3 \\cdot 4 + 0 \\end{align*}\nThe last non-zero remainder is $4$. Therefore, the minimal positive value of $|31784x + 19532y|$ is $4$.\n\nFinally, we characterize the set of all integer pairs $(x,y)$ for which $|ax+by| = d$, where $d=\\gcd(a,b)$. This is equivalent to finding all integer solutions to the two linear Diophantine equations:\n$1$. $ax+by = d$\n$2$. $ax+by = -d$\n\nLet's first analyze the equation $ax+by=d$. The extended Euclidean algorithm provides a method to find one particular solution, $(x_p, y_p)$, to this equation. To find the general solution, we consider the associated homogeneous equation $ax+by=0$. This can be rewritten as $\\frac{a}{d}x = -\\frac{b}{d}y$. Since $d = \\gcd(a,b)$, the integers $\\frac{a}{d}$ and $\\frac{b}{d}$ are coprime. For the equality to hold, $x$ must be a multiple of $\\frac{b}{d}$ and $y$ must be a multiple of $-\\frac{a}{d}$. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is $(x_h, y_h) = (k \\frac{b}{d}, -k \\frac{a}{d})$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The general solution to $ax+by=d$ is the sum of one particular solution and the general homogeneous solution:\n$$ (x,y) = \\left( x_p + k \\frac{b}{d}, y_p - k \\frac{a}{d} \\right) \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nThis describes all pairs $(x,y)$ satisfying $ax+by=d$.\n\nFor the second equation, $ax+by=-d$, a particular solution is simply $(-x_p, -y_p)$, since $a(-x_p)+b(-y_p) = -(ax_p+by_p)=-d$. The general solution for this case is found by adding the same homogeneous solution:\n$$ (x,y) = \\left( -x_p + k \\frac{b}{d}, -y_p - k \\frac{a}{d} \\right) \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nTherefore, the complete set of integer pairs $(x,y)$ for which the minimum positive value $d$ is achieved consists of the union of these two families of solutions, where $(x_p, y_p)$ is any particular solution to $ax+by=d$ (typically found via the extended Euclidean algorithm).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3090818"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous concepts, this final practice puts the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to work in one of its most important applications: solving linear congruences.

Proof on the number of solutions to a linear congruence.\n\nWe are asked to prove that if the linear congruence $a x \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ has a solution, then its set of solutions consists of exactly $d = \\gcd(a,m)$ distinct residue classes modulo $m$. We are given that we must start from the definition of congruence, $m \\mid (ax-b)$, and use Bézout's identity.\n\nLet $d = \\gcd(a,m)$. The condition for the existence of a solution to $a x \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ is that $d \\mid b$. The problem statement gives as a premise that at least one solution exists. Let's call this solution $x_0$.\nBy definition of congruence, $a x_0 \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ means that $m \\mid (a x_0 - b)$.\n\nLet $x$ be any arbitrary solution to the congruence. Then, we have:\n$a x \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$\n$a x_0 \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$\n\nSubtracting the second congruence from the first gives:\n$a x - a x_0 \\equiv b - b \\pmod{m}$\n$a(x - x_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{m}$\n\nBy the definition of congruence, this means $m \\mid a(x - x_0)$.\nLet $d = \\gcd(a,m)$. We can write $a = da'$ and $m = dm'$ for some integers $a'$ and $m'$ where $\\gcd(a', m') = 1$. Substituting these into the divisibility relation:\n$dm' \\mid da'(x - x_0)$\n\nSince $d \\ge 1$ (as $m \\ge 2$), we can divide both sides by $d$:\n$m' \\mid a'(x - x_0)$\n\nSince $\\gcd(a', m') = 1$, we can apply Euclid's Lemma, which states that if an integer divides the product of two other integers and is coprime to one of them, then it must divide the other. Thus, we must have:\n$m' \\mid (x - x_0)$\n\nThis implies that $x - x_0$ is a multiple of $m'$. So, $x - x_0 = k m'$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $m' = m/d$:\n$x - x_0 = k \\frac{m}{d}$\n$x = x_0 + k \\frac{m}{d}$\n\nThis expression gives all possible integer solutions $x$ in terms of the initial solution $x_0$. Now, we need to determine how many of these solutions are distinct modulo $m$. We can generate a set of potential solutions by letting $k$ take on integer values. Let's consider the values $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, d-1$. This gives the set of solutions:\n$S = \\{x_0, x_0 + \\frac{m}{d}, x_0 + 2\\frac{m}{d}, \\dots, x_0 + (d-1)\\frac{m}{d}\\}$\n\nFirst, we show these $d$ solutions are distinct modulo $m$. Suppose for two integers $i, j$ such that $0 \\le j  i \\le d-1$, we have:\n$x_0 + i \\frac{m}{d} \\equiv x_0 + j \\frac{m}{d} \\pmod{m}$\nThen $i \\frac{m}{d} \\equiv j \\frac{m}{d} \\pmod{m}$, which implies $m \\mid (i-j)\\frac{m}{d}$.\nThis means that there exists an integer $q$ such that $(i-j)\\frac{m}{d} = qm$. Dividing by $m$ (which is non-zero as $m \\ge 2$), we get $\\frac{i-j}{d} = q$, which implies $d \\mid (i-j)$.\nHowever, given our choice of $i$ and $j$, we have $0  i-j  d$. Since $i-j$ is a positive integer strictly less than $d$, it cannot be divisible by $d$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the $d$ solutions in the set $S$ are all distinct modulo $m$.\n\nNext, we show that any solution to the congruence is congruent to one of these $d$ solutions. Let $x$ be any solution. From our derivation, $x = x_0 + k \\frac{m}{d}$ for some integer $k$. By the Division Algorithm, we can write $k = qd + r$, where $q$ and $r$ are integers and $0 \\le r \\le d-1$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $x$:\n$x = x_0 + (qd + r)\\frac{m}{d} = x_0 + qd\\frac{m}{d} + r\\frac{m}{d} = x_0 + qm + r\\frac{m}{d}$\nConsidering this equation modulo $m$:\n$x \\equiv x_0 + qm + r\\frac{m}{d} \\pmod{m}$\n$x \\equiv x_0 + r\\frac{m}{d} \\pmod{m}$\nSince $0 \\le r \\le d-1$, the term $x_0 + r\\frac{m}{d}$ is one of the $d$ solutions in the set $S$. Thus, any solution is congruent to one of these $d$ solutions.\n\nThis completes the proof that there are exactly $d=\\gcd(a,m)$ distinct solutions modulo $m$.\n\n2. Efficiency of the Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nWe are asked to explain the efficiency of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) by deriving an upper bound on the number of division steps required by the Euclidean algorithm to compute $\\gcd(a,m)$. The bound should be in terms of a logarithm of $m$. The EEA has the same number of division steps as the standard Euclidean algorithm.\n\nLet the inputs to the algorithm be $r_0$ and $r_1$, with $r_0  r_1  0$. In our case, this corresponds to $r_0=m$ and $r_1=a$ (assuming $ma$; if not, the first step effectively swaps them). The algorithm generates a sequence of remainders:\n$r_0 = q_1 r_1 + r_2$, with $0 \\le r_2  r_1$\n$r_1 = q_2 r_2 + r_3$, with $0 \\le r_3  r_2$\n...\n$r_{i} = q_{i+1} r_{i+1} + r_{i+2}$, with $0 \\le r_{i+2}  r_{i+1}$\n...\nThe algorithm terminates when a remainder is $0$. Let $n$ be the number of division steps. This means $r_{n+1}=0$ and $r_n$ is the last non-zero remainder, $r_n = \\gcd(r_0, r_1)$.\n\nWe want to find a lower bound on the rate of decrease of the remainders $r_i$. Consider the step $r_{i} = q_{i+1} r_{i+1} + r_{i+2}$. Since $r_{i+1}  r_{i+2} \\ge 0$, the quotient $q_{i+1} = \\lfloor r_i / r_{i+1} \\rfloor$ must be at least $1$.\nSo, $r_i \\ge 1 \\cdot r_{i+1} + r_{i+2} = r_{i+1} + r_{i+2}$.\nSince $r_{i+1} > r_{i+2}$, we can write $r_{i+1} \\ge r_{i+2} + 1$.\nTherefore, $r_i = r_{i+1} + r_{i+2} > r_{i+2} + r_{i+2} = 2r_{i+2}$.\nThis gives us the inequality $r_{i+2}  \\frac{1}{2} r_i$.\n\nThis inequality shows that every two steps, the remainder is more than halved.\nLet's apply this relationship to the sequence of remainders, starting from $r_0=m$ and $r_1=a$:\n$r_2  r_1  r_0 = m$\n$r_3  r_2$\n$r_4  \\frac{1}{2} r_2$\n$r_5  \\frac{1}{2} r_3$\n$r_6  \\frac{1}{2} r_4  \\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{1}{2} r_2) = \\frac{1}{4} r_2$\n\nGenerally, for any integer $k \\ge 1$:\n$r_{2k}  \\frac{m}{2^k}$\n$r_{2k+1}  \\frac{a}{2^k}$\n\nThe algorithm performs $n$ steps, so $r_n$ is the last non-zero remainder. We know $r_n \\ge 1$.\nCase 1: $n$ is even. Let $n = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\nThen $1 \\le r_n = r_{2k}  \\frac{m}{2^k}$.\nThis implies $2^k  m$.\nTaking the base-$2$ logarithm, we get $k  \\log_2(m)$.\nThe number of steps is $n = 2k  2\\log_2(m)$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is odd. Let $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\nIf $k=0$, $n=1$. This means $r_2=0$, so $r_1$ divides $r_0$. The bound must hold. $1  2\\log_2(m)+1$ for $m \\ge 2$.\nIf $k \\ge 1$:\n$1 \\le r_n = r_{2k+1}  \\frac{a}{2^k}$.\nThis implies $2^k  a  m$.\nTaking the base-$2$ logarithm, $k  \\log_2(a)  \\log_2(m)$.\nThe number of steps is $n = 2k+1  2\\log_2(m) + 1$.\n\nIn all cases, the number of steps $n$ is bounded by $2\\log_2(m)+1$. We can express this using the natural logarithm:\n$n  2\\frac{\\ln(m)}{\\ln(2)} + 1$.\nThis shows that the number of division steps grows at most as a linear function of the logarithm of $m$. Since the work per step (a division) is also polynomial in the number of bits of the inputs (which is proportional to $\\log m$), the entire algorithm is computationally efficient (polynomial time in the input size).\n\n3. Application to $414 x \\equiv 48 \\pmod{662}$.\n\nWe are given $a = 414$, $b = 48$, and $m = 662$.\nFirst, we compute $d = \\gcd(414, 662)$ using the Euclidean Algorithm:\n$662 = 1 \\cdot 414 + 248$\n$414 = 1 \\cdot 248 + 166$\n$248 = 1 \\cdot 166 + 82$\n$166 = 2 \\cdot 82 + 2$\n$82 = 41 \\cdot 2 + 0$\nThe greatest common divisor is $d = 2$.\nFor the congruence to have solutions, we must have $d \\mid b$. Here, $2 \\mid 48$, so solutions exist. There will be $d=2$ distinct solutions modulo $662$.\n\nTo find a particular solution, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express $d$ as a linear combination of $a$ and $m$, i.e., $414u + 662v = 2$. We work backwards from the division steps:\n$2 = 166 - 2 \\cdot 82$\nFrom the previous step, $82 = 248 - 1 \\cdot 166$. Substituting this:\n$2 = 166 - 2 \\cdot (248 - 1 \\cdot 166) = 166 - 2 \\cdot 248 + 2 \\cdot 166 = 3 \\cdot 166 - 2 \\cdot 248$\nFrom the step before, $166 = 414 - 1 \\cdot 248$:\n$2 = 3 \\cdot (414 - 1 \\cdot 248) - 2 \\cdot 248 = 3 \\cdot 414 - 3 \\cdot 248 - 2 \\cdot 248 = 3 \\cdot 414 - 5 \\cdot 248$\nFrom the first step, $248 = 662 - 1 \\cdot 414$:\n$2 = 3 \\cdot 414 - 5 \\cdot (662 - 1 \\cdot 414) = 3 \\cdot 414 - 5 \\cdot 662 + 5 \\cdot 414 = 8 \\cdot 414 - 5 \\cdot 662$\n\nSo, we have found integers $u=8$ and $v=-5$ such that $8 \\cdot 414 - 5 \\cdot 662 = 2$.\nConsidering this equation modulo $662$:\n$8 \\cdot 414 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{662}$\nWe want to solve $414x \\equiv 48 \\pmod{662}$. We can scale our found congruence by a factor of $48/d = 48/2 = 24$:\n$24 \\cdot (8 \\cdot 414) \\equiv 24 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{662}$\n$(24 \\cdot 8) \\cdot 414 \\equiv 48 \\pmod{662}$\n$192 \\cdot 414 \\equiv 48 \\pmod{662}$\n\nA particular solution is therefore $x_0 = 192$.\nThe general solution is given by $x = x_0 + k \\frac{m}{d}$ for any integer $k$.\n$x = 192 + k \\frac{662}{2} = 192 + k \\cdot 331$\nWe are looking for the smallest non-negative solution.\nFor $k=0$, $x = 192$. This is non-negative.\nFor $k=1$, $x = 192 + 331 = 523$.\nFor $k=-1$, $x = 192 - 331 = -139$.\nThe non-negative solutions are $192, 523, 854, \\dots$. The smallest of these is $192$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{192}$$", "id": "3090833"}]}
