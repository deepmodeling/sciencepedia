First, we must determine the set of distinct residue classes of $x^2$ modulo $2$ for an integer $x$, and compute the sum $S$ of these residues. Second, we must use this result to prove by contradiction that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nFirst, we determine the possible values of $x^2 \\pmod{2}$. An integer $x$ must be either even or odd. This property is known as parity. We analyze these two cases.\n\nCase 1: $x$ is an even integer.\nBy definition, an even integer can be written in the form $x = 2k$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Squaring this expression, we get:\n$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$\nSince $k$ is an integer, $k^2$ is also an integer, and so is $2k^2$. Let $m = 2k^2$, where $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $x^2 = 2m$. This shows that $x^2$ is divisible by $2$. In the language of modular arithmetic, this means that $x^2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $2$.\n$$x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$$\n\nCase 2: $x$ is an odd integer.\nBy definition, an odd integer can be written in the form $x = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Squaring this expression, we get:\n$$x^2 = (2k+1)^2 = (2k)^2 + 2(2k)(1) + 1^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$$\nWe can factor out a $2$ from the first two terms:\n$$x^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$$\nSince $k$ is an integer, $2k^2 + 2k$ is also an integer. Let $n = 2k^2 + 2k$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $x^2 = 2n+1$. This shows that when $x^2$ is divided by $2$, it leaves a remainder of $1$. In modular arithmetic notation:\n$$x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$\n\nFrom these two cases, we see that the square of any integer is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $2$. Therefore, the set of distinct residue classes attained by $x^2 \\pmod{2}$, using the canonical residue set $\\{0, 1\\}$, is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe problem defines $S$ as the sum of these distinct residues.\n$$S = 0 + 1 = 1$$\n\nNext, we use this characterization of square residues modulo $2$ to prove that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. The proof proceeds by contradiction.\n\nThe fundamental premises are the definition of a rational number, the definition of parity (as explored above), and the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nStep 1: Assume that $\\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number.\nBy the definition of a rational number, there exist integers $p$ and $q$, with $q \\neq 0$, such that:\n$$\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$$\nFurthermore, we can assume that the fraction $\\frac{p}{q}$ is in its simplest form, which means that $p$ and $q$ are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is $1$. This implies that $p$ and $q$ cannot both be even.\n\nStep 2: Manipulate the equation.\nSquaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$ gives:\n$$2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$$\nMultiplying both sides by $q^2$ yields:\n$$p^2 = 2q^2$$\n\nStep 3: Analyze the equation using parity and the result from the first part.\nThe equation $p^2 = 2q^2$ shows that $p^2$ is an even number, since it is a multiple of $2$. In the language of modular arithmetic, $p^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nFrom our earlier analysis, we know that if an integer's square is even ($x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$), then the integer itself must be even ($x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$). If the integer were odd ($x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$), its square would be odd ($x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$).\nTherefore, since $p^2$ is even, $p$ must also be an even integer.\n\nStep 4: Use the fact that $p$ is even.\nSince $p$ is even, we can write it as $p=2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this expression for $p$ back into the equation $p^2 = 2q^2$:\n$$(2k)^2 = 2q^2$$\n$$4k^2 = 2q^2$$\nDividing both sides by $2$, we obtain:\n$$q^2 = 2k^2$$\n\nStep 5: Analyze the new equation and find the contradiction.\nThe equation $q^2 = 2k^2$ shows that $q^2$ is an even number, since it is a multiple of $2$. Consequently, $q^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nApplying the same logic as in Step 3, since $q^2$ is even, the integer $q$ must also be even.\nWe have now concluded that $p$ is even and $q$ is also even. This means that both $p$ and $q$ are divisible by $2$. This contradicts our initial assumption that $p$ and $q$ are coprime (i.e., that the fraction $\\frac{p}{q}$ is fully reduced).\n\nStep 6: Conclude the proof.\nBecause our initial assumption that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational leads to a logical contradiction, the assumption must be false. Therefore, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number. The critical step in this proof relies on the fact that only an even number can produce an even square, a direct consequence of the modular analysis performed in the first part of the problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact computation of $S$.

The concepts of rational numbers, integers, parity, and divisibility are fundamental mathematical principles. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a flawed logical argument and asks for its correction. The flaw is specific and well-known, and the task is to evaluate proposed corrections. This is a well-posed problem with a clear objective.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and mathematical, free from ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The central \"flaw\" described is an intentional part of the problem setup, designed to test the user's understanding of proof by contradiction. The argument concludes that both $a$ and $b$ are even and asserts this is a contradiction, without having established a premise that this conclusion would contradict. For example, the integers $a=6$ and $b=4$ are both even. The statement \"a and b are both even\" is not, in isolation, a logical contradiction. This logical gap is the \"pitfall\".\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe logical pitfall in the student's argument is the final step. The conclusion that integers $a$ and $b$ are both even is not inherently a contradiction. A contradiction arises when a conclusion logically negates an initial assumption or a necessary consequence of that assumption. The student's argument, as stated, is incomplete because it does not state an assumption that is contradicted by the finding that $a$ and $b$ share a factor of $2$.\n\nA valid proof must bridge this gap. There are two standard ways to do this, both of which build upon the student's correct preliminary steps ($a$ is even and $b$ is even).\n1.  **Contradiction of a \"Lowest Terms\" Assumption:** Start by assuming that the fraction $a/b$ is expressed in lowest terms, i.e., that the greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(a, b)$, is $1$. The conclusion that both $a$ and $b$ are even implies that they share a common divisor of $2$, so $\\gcd(a,b) \\ge 2$. This directly contradicts the assumption that $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$.\n2.  **Proof by Infinite Descent:** Use the fact that $a$ and $b$ are both even to construct a new representation of $\\sqrt{2}$ with a smaller positive denominator (and numerator). If we start by assuming $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the derivation $a=2k$ and $b=2\\ell$ leads to $\\sqrt{2} = a/b = (2k)/(2\\ell) = k/\\ell$, where $k=a/2$ and $\\ell=b/2$ are integers. Since $b  0$, we have $0  \\ell  b$. This process can be repeated indefinitely to generate an infinite strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers $(b, \\ell, \\ell', \\dots)$, which is impossible by the well-ordering principle of the natural numbers.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**A. Add the hypothesis that $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and $b\\neq 0$ at the outset, since without $b\\neq 0$ the fraction $a/b$ is undefined, and this fixes the contradiction step.**\nThe student's argument already states \"for integers $a$ and $b$ with $b\\neq 0$\". Adding this hypothesis is redundant. Crucially, this addition does not address the logical gap. It does not explain why \"$a$ and $b$ are both even\" is a contradiction. Therefore, this option fails to fix the argument.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Explicitly assume that $a/b$ is in lowest terms, i.e., $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, and use the fact that if a prime $p$ divides $x^2$ then $p$ divides $x$ to conclude from $2b^2=a^2$ that $2\\mid a$; write $a=2k$ to deduce $b^2=2k^2$, hence $2\\mid b$, so both $a$ and $b$ are even, contradicting $\\gcd(a,b)=1$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the missing piece required for a valid proof by contradiction. It introduces the crucial, justifiable assumption that any rational number can be written in lowest terms, so we may assume $\\gcd(a,b)=1$. It then correctly shows that the intermediate conclusion, that both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $2$, leads to $\\gcd(a,b) \\ge 2$. This result contradicts the initial assumption that $\\gcd(a,b)=1$. This revision is logically sound and complete.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Do not assume $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, but replace the final “contradiction” with an explicit infinite descent: from $2b^2=a^2$, deduce $2\\mid a$ and $2\\mid b$, so $a/b=(2k)/(2\\ell)=k/\\ell$ with strictly smaller positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$; repeating yields an infinite strictly decreasing sequence in $\\mathbb{N}$, which is impossible, hence the initial rationality assumption fails.**\nThis option presents the alternative valid proof method of infinite descent. It correctly notes that the initial assumption $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ is not necessary for this line of reasoning. It correctly uses the student's intermediate results ($2 \\mid a$ and $2 \\mid b$) to construct a smaller integer representation, $k/\\ell$. Repeating this procedure on a representation with positive integers would generate an infinite, strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers. The impossibility of such a sequence (by the well-ordering principle) provides the necessary contradiction. This revision is also logically sound and complete.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. From $2b^2=a^2$, infer that $a$ is even and $b$ is odd; therefore $a/b$ cannot equal $\\sqrt{2}$, yielding a contradiction without further assumptions.**\nThis option contains a fatal mathematical error. The argument correctly implies $a$ is even. Let $a=2k$. The equation becomes $2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$, which simplifies to $b^2 = 2k^2$. This implies $b^2$ is even, and therefore $b$ must also be even. The claim that one can infer \"$b$ is odd\" is false. The argument proves the opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Invoke uniqueness of prime factorization to assert that $2$ must divide exactly one of $a$ or $b$, so it is impossible for $2b^2=a^2$ to hold; hence the original argument is correct without any change.**\nThe uniqueness of prime factorization (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) does provide a very elegant proof. The number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $a^2$ must be even. The number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $2b^2$ must be odd. Since an even number cannot equal an odd number, the exponents of the prime factor $2$ cannot match, so the equality $2b^2 = a^2$ is impossible for non-zero integers $a, b$. However, the option makes two flawed claims. First, it misstates the argument as \"2 must divide exactly one of $a$ or $b$\". Second, and more critically, it concludes that \"the original argument is correct without any change\". This is false; the original argument is logically incomplete. This option describes a different, valid proof but incorrectly uses it to justify the flawed original argument.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, both Options B and C describe valid and complete corrections to the logical pitfall in the student's original argument.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$", "id": "3086580"}, {"introduction": "Having proven that certain numbers are irrational, we can shift our focus from \"what\" they are to \"where\" they are.
