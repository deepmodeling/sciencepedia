First, the action of $Y$ on $f(x,y,z)$:\n$$Y(f) = \\partial_{y}(f) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$$\n\nNext, we apply the operator $X$ to the resulting function $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$:\n$$X(Y(f)) = (\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z})\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) + y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} + y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z \\partial y}$$\n\nNow we compute the second part of the commutator. First, the action of $X$ on $f$:\n$$X(f) = (\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z})(f) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNext, we apply the operator $Y$ to the resulting function $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$:\n$$Y(X(f)) = \\partial_{y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\nUsing the linearity of the derivative and the product rule for the second term:\n$$Y(X(f)) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\n$$Y(X(f)) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y}\\right)\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\n$$Y(X(f)) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z}$$\n\nNow we can compute the Lie bracket:\n$$\\left[X,Y\\right]f = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))$$\n$$\\left[X,Y\\right]f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} + y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z \\partial y}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z}\\right)$$\nBy the equality of mixed partial derivatives for smooth functions (Clairaut's theorem), we have $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\\left[X,Y\\right]f = -\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$$\nThis means that the Lie bracket $\\left[X,Y\\right]$ is the vector field that maps any function $f$ to $-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$. This vector field is $-\\partial_{z}$.\n$$\\left[X,Y\\right] = -\\partial_{z}$$\n\nThe second part of the problem is to determine if the distribution $D$ is involutive. The distribution $D$ is the set of all pointwise linear combinations of $X$ and $Y$. It is defined as $D_p = \\text{span}\\{X_p, Y_p\\}$ for each $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\nFor $D$ to be involutive, the Lie bracket of any two vector fields which are sections of $D$ must also be a section of $D$. By the properties of the Lie bracket, it is sufficient to check if the Lie bracket of the basis vector fields, $\\left[X,Y\\right]$, is a section of $D$.\nThis means we need to determine if there exist smooth functions $a(x,y,z)$ and $b(x,y,z)$ such that:\n$$\\left[X,Y\\right] = aX + bY$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\left[X,Y\\right]$, $X$, and $Y$:\n$$-\\partial_{z} = a(\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}) + b(\\partial_{y})$$\n$$-\\partial_{z} = a\\,\\partial_{x} + b\\,\\partial_{y} + ay\\,\\partial_{z}$$\nThe vector fields $\\partial_{x}$, $\\partial_{y}$, and $\\partial_{z}$ form a basis for the tangent space at every point. We can equate the components:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Component along $\\partial_{x}$: $0 = a$\n    \\item Component along $\\partial_{y}$: $0 = b$\n    \\item Component along $\\partial_{z}$: $-1 = ay$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFrom the first two equations, we must have $a=0$ and $b=0$. Substituting $a=0$ into the third equation gives:\n$$-1 = (0)y \\implies -1 = 0$$\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no functions $a$ and $b$ for which the equality holds. The vector field $\\left[X,Y\\right] = -\\partial_{z}$ does not belong to the distribution $D$.\n\nConsequently, the distribution $D$ is not involutive.

The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution, following the specified steps.\n\nStep 1: Compute the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$.\nThe Lie bracket of two vector fields $V$ and $W$ can be computed via their action on a smooth test function $f(x,y,z)$, where $[V,W](f) = V(W(f)) - W(V(f))$.\nThe given vector fields are $X = \\partial_{x} + x\\partial_{z}$ and $Y = \\partial_{y}$.\n\nFirst, we apply $Y$ and then $X$ to $f$:\n$$\nX(Y(f)) = (\\partial_{x} + x\\partial_{z})(\\partial_{y}f) = \\partial_{x}(\\partial_{y}f) + x\\partial_{z}(\\partial_{y}f) = \\partial_{x}\\partial_{y}f + x\\partial_{z}\\partial_{y}f\n$$\nNext, we apply $X$ and then $Y$ to $f$:\n$$\nY(X(f)) = \\partial_{y}((\\partial_{x} + x\\partial_{z})f) = \\partial_{y}(\\partial_{x}f + x\\partial_{z}f)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\nY(X(f)) = \\partial_{y}(\\partial_{x}f) + \\partial_{y}(x\\partial_{z}f) = \\partial_{y}\\partial_{x}f + (\\partial_{y}x)\\partial_{z}f + x\\partial_{y}(\\partial_{z}f)\n$$\nSince $x$ is an independent coordinate, $\\partial_{y}x = 0$. This simplifies to:\n$$\nY(X(f)) = \\partial_{y}\\partial_{x}f + x\\partial_{y}\\partial_{z}f\n$$\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket:\n$$\n[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)) = (\\partial_{x}\\partial_{y}f + x\\partial_{z}\\partial_{y}f) - (\\partial_{y}\\partial_{x}f + x\\partial_{y}\\partial_{z}f)\n$$\nBy the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Clairaut's theorem) for smooth functions, $\\partial_{x}\\partial_{y}f = \\partial_{y}\\partial_{x}f$ and $\\partial_{z}\\partial_{y}f = \\partial_{y}\\partial_{z}f$.

A distribution $D$ spanned by a set of vector fields $\\{X_i\\}$ is involutive if the Lie bracket of any two vector fields in the set, $[X_i, X_j]$, lies within the distribution $D$ at every point. In our case, $D=\\operatorname{span}\\{X,Y\\}$, so we must check if $[X,Y] \\in D$.\n\nFrom the previous step, we found that $[X,Y]=0$. The zero vector field can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors with zero coefficients:\n$$\n[X,Y] = 0 = 0 \\cdot X + 0 \\cdot Y\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that $[X,Y]$ is a vector field in $D$. Therefore, the distribution $D$ is involutive. According to the Frobenius theorem, $D$ is integrable. This means that through every point in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, there exists a unique maximal connected $2$-dimensional submanifold (an integral leaf) whose tangent space at every point is given by $D$.\n\nStep 3: Find the integral leaves.\nSince $D$ is integrable, the integral leaves can be described as the level sets of a scalar function $F(x,y,z)$. The problem instructs us to find such an $F$ by first identifying a $1$-form $\\alpha$ that annihilates $D$.\nA $1$-form $\\alpha$ annihilates $D$ if $\\alpha(V)=0$ for all $V \\in D$. This is equivalent to requiring $\\alpha(X)=0$ and $\\alpha(Y)=0$.\nLet the general $1$-form be $\\alpha = \\alpha_{x}dx + \\alpha_{y}dy + \\alpha_{z}dz$.\n\nThe condition $\\alpha(Y)=0$ gives:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\partial_{y}) = (\\alpha_{x}dx + \\alpha_{y}dy + \\alpha_{z}dz)(\\partial_{y}) = \\alpha_{y} = 0\n$$\nThe condition $\\alpha(X)=0$ gives:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\partial_{x} + x\\partial_{z}) = (\\alpha_{x}dx + \\alpha_{y}dy + \\alpha_{z}dz)(\\partial_{x} + x\\partial_{z}) = \\alpha_{x} + x\\alpha_{z} = 0\n$$\nWe have a system of linear equations for the components of $\\alpha$:\n1. $\\alpha_{y} = 0$\n2. $\\alpha_{x} + x\\alpha_{z} = 0$\n\nWe need to find a non-trivial solution. We can choose one component and solve for the others. Let us set $\\alpha_{z} = 1$. Then from the second equation, $\\alpha_{x} = -x$.\nThus, a $1$-form that annihilates $D$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha = -x\\,dx + 0\\,dy + 1\\,dz = -x\\,dx + dz\n$$\nThe integrability of $D$ implies that this Pfaffian system, defined by $\\alpha = 0$, is integrable. For a $1$-form $\\alpha$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, this means that $\\alpha$ must be proportional to an exact differential, i.e., there exists a non-vanishing function $\\lambda$ such that $\\lambda\\alpha$ is an exact $1$-form, or $d(\\lambda\\alpha)=0$. The condition for this is $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha = 0$. Let's check our $\\alpha$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(-x\\,dx + dz) = d(-x)\\wedge dx + d(dz) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x}dx\\right) \\wedge dx + 0 = -dx \\wedge dx = 0\n$$\nSince $d\\alpha=0$, the form $\\alpha$ is closed. By the Poincaré lemma, every closed form on a contractible domain like $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is exact. This means there exists a scalar function $F(x,y,z)$ such that $dF = \\alpha$. In this case, the integrating factor $\\lambda$ is simply $1$.\n\nWe now find $F$ by integrating $\\alpha$:\n$$\ndF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}dy + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}dz = -x\\,dx + dz\n$$\nBy comparing the components, we get a system of partial differential equations for $F$:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -x$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 1$\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $x$:\n$$\nF(x,y,z) = \\int (-x) \\,dx = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + g(y,z)\n$$\nwhere $g(y,z)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$ and $z$.\nDifferentiating this result with respect to $y$ and using the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $g$ is not a function of $y$, so $g(y,z) = h(z)$ for some function $h(z)$.\nThus, $F(x,y,z) = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + h(z)$.\nDifferentiating this with respect to $z$ and using the third equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = \\frac{dh}{dz} = 1\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $z$ gives $h(z) = z + C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant of integration.\nWe can choose $C=0$ for simplicity. The resulting function is:\n$$\nF(x,y,z) = z - \\frac{x^2}{2}\n$$\nThe integral leaves of the distribution $D$ are the level sets of this function, $\\{F=\\text{constant}\\}$, which are given by the equations $z - \\frac{x^2}{2} = c$ for constants $c$.

Thus, $D$ is a well-defined rank-$2$ smooth distribution. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n1. Justification of Integrability:\nAccording to the Frobenius theorem, a smooth distribution $D$ is integrable if and only if it is involutive. A distribution spanned by a set of vector fields $\\{Y_{i}\\}$ is involutive if the Lie bracket $[Y_{i}, Y_{j}]$ of any two vector fields from the spanning set lies within the distribution $D$ at every point. In our case, $D$ is spanned by $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, so we need to compute their Lie bracket $[X_{1}, X_{2}]$ and check if it is a linear combination of $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$.\n\nThe Lie bracket is defined as $[X_{1}, X_{2}] = X_{1}X_{2} - X_{2}X_{1}$. We apply this operator to an arbitrary smooth function $f(x,y,z)$:\n$$\n[X_{1}, X_{2}](f) = X_{1}(X_{2}(f)) - X_{2}(X_{1}(f))\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)(f)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for the second term:\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nSince the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are Cartesian, we have $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}=0$ and the mixed partial derivatives are equal (Clairaut's theorem for smooth functions), i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z\\partial x}$.\n$$\n[X_{1}, X_{2}](f) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x\\partial z} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $[X_{1}, X_{2}](f)=0$ for any smooth function $f$, the Lie bracket is the zero vector field, $[X_{1}, X_{2}] = 0$. The zero vector field is trivially in any vector space, so $0 \\in D_{q}$ for all $q \\in M$. Therefore, the distribution $D$ is involutive. By the Frobenius theorem, $D$ is integrable.\n\n2. Construction of Local Coordinates:\nWe seek a new local coordinate system $(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3})$ in a neighborhood of $p=(0,0,0)$ such that $x^{i}(p)=0$ for $i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, and the distribution $D$ is spanned by $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2}}$. This implies that the level sets of the function $x^{3}$ are the integral manifolds (leaves) of the distribution $D$. Therefore, $x^{3}$ must be a common first integral of $X_1$ and $X_2$, meaning it must be constant along their integral curves. This is equivalent to the conditions $X_{1}(x^{3})=0$ and $X_{2}(x^{3})=0$.\n\nFirst, we find $x^{3}=\\phi(x,y,z)$:\nThe condition $X_{2}(x^{3}) = 0$ implies $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z} = 0$. This means $\\phi$ is a function of $x$ and $y$ only, so $\\phi(x,y,z) = g(x,y)$.\nThe condition $X_{1}(x^{3}) = 0$ implies $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})g(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 0$. This implies $g$ is a function of $y$ only, so $g(x,y) = h(y)$.\nThus, any function of $y$ is a first integral. We choose the simplest non-constant function and set $x^{3}(x,y,z) = y$. We check the condition at $p$: $x^{3}(0,0,0) = 0$, which is satisfied.\n\nNext, we construct $x^{1}$ and $x^{2}$. The problem specifies that we should construct them so that $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ become the coordinate vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2}}$. This means we require $X_{1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}$ and $X_{2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2}}$. This is equivalent to the set of conditions:\n$X_{1}(x^{1})=1$, $X_{1}(x^{2})=0$, $X_{1}(x^{3})=0$.\n$X_{2}(x^{1})=0$, $X_{2}(x^{2})=1$, $X_{2}(x^{3})=0$.\nOur choice $x^{3}=y$ already satisfies $X_{1}(x^{3}) = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(y) = 0$ and $X_{2}(x^{3}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(y) = 0$.\n\nLet's find $x^{1}(x,y,z)$:\n$X_{2}(x^{1})=0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial z} = 0$, so $x^{1}$ is a function of $x$ and $y$ only, $x^{1}(x,y)$.\n$X_{1}(x^{1})=1 \\implies (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})x^{1}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial x} = 1$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives $x^{1}(x,y) = x + k(y)$ for some function $k$.\nThe condition $x^{1}(0,0,0)=0$ implies $0+k(0)=0$, so $k(0)=0$. The simplest choice is $k(y)=0$. Thus, we set $x^{1}(x,y,z) = x$.\n\nNow let's find $x^{2}(x,y,z)$:\n$X_{2}(x^{2})=1 \\implies \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial z} = 1$.\nIntegrating with respect to $z$ gives $x^{2}(x,y,z) = z + j(x,y)$ for some function $j$.\n$X_{1}(x^{2})=0 \\implies (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(z+j(x,y)) = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(z+j(x,y)) + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(z+j(x,y)) = \\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x} + y(1) = 0$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x} = -y$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives $j(x,y) = -xy + m(y)$ for some function $m$.\nSo, $x^{2}(x,y,z) = z - xy + m(y)$.\nThe condition $x^{2}(0,0,0)=0$ implies $0 - 0 + m(0) = 0$, so $m(0)=0$. The simplest choice is $m(y)=0$. Thus, we set $x^{2}(x,y,z) = z - xy$.\n\nOur candidate coordinate system is $(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}) = (x, z-xy, y)$. All three functions evaluate to $0$ at $(0,0,0)$.\n\n3. Verification as a Local Diffeomorphism:\nWe consider the coordinate transformation map $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by $\\Phi(x,y,z) = (x^{1}(x,y,z), x^{2}(x,y,z), x^{3}(x,y,z)) = (x, z-xy, y)$. For this map to be a local diffeomorphism at $p=(0,0,0)$, its Jacobian matrix must be invertible at that point. The Jacobian matrix is $J = \\frac{\\partial(x^{1},x^{2},x^{3})}{\\partial(x,y,z)}$.\n$$\nJ(x,y,z) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial x^{3}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x^{3}}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial x^{3}}{\\partial z}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-y & -x & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the point $p=(0,0,0)$:\n$$\nJ(0,0,0) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-0 & -0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(J(0,0,0)) = 1 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 0 + 0 = -1\n$$\nSince $\\det(J(0,0,0)) = -1 \\neq 0$, the Jacobian matrix is invertible at $p=(0,0,0)$. By the Inverse Function Theorem, the map $\\Phi$ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of $p$.\nThe constructed coordinate system $(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}) = (x, z-xy, y)$ satisfies all the requirements of the problem.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered triple of functions defining the new coordinates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} x & z - xy & y \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3044256"}]}
