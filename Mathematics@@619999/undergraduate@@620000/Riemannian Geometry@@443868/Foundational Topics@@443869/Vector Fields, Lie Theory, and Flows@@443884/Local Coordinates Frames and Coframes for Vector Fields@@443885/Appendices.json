To determine these coefficients, we can evaluate this covector on the basis vector fields $\\{\\partial_{k}\\}$. By the definition of the dual basis, $dx^{j}(\\partial_{k}) = \\delta^{j}_{k}$, where $\\delta^{j}_{k}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nEvaluating the linear combination on $\\partial_{k}$:\n$$\n(\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{i}))(\\partial_{k}) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} dx^{j} \\right)(\\partial_{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} dx^{j}(\\partial_{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} \\delta^{j}_{k} = c_{ik}\n$$\nNow, we use the coordinate-free definition of the flat operator, $\\flat_{g}(X)(Y) = g(X,Y)$. Setting $X = \\partial_{i}$ and $Y = \\partial_{k}$:\n$$\n(\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{i}))(\\partial_{k}) = g(\\partial_{i}, \\partial_{k})\n$$\nBy the definition of the metric components, this is equal to $g_{ik}$.\nEquating the two expressions for $(\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{i}))(\\partial_{k})$, we find the coefficients:\n$$\nc_{ik} = g_{ik}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the linear combination (and renaming the summation index from $j$ to $k$ for clarity) gives the expression for $\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{i})$:\n$$\n\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} g_{ij} dx^{j}\n$$\n\n**2. Expression for $\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i})$**\n\nThe object $\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i})$ is a vector field (a section of $TM$). It can be expressed as a linear combination of the frame basis elements $\\{\\partial_{j}\\}$:\n$$\n\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A^{ij} \\partial_{j}\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $A^{ij}$ are to be determined. We use the coordinate-free definition of the sharp operator: for any vector field $Y$, $g(\\sharp_{g}(\\alpha), Y) = \\alpha(Y)$.\nLet $\\alpha = dx^{i}$ and test this identity on the basis vectors $Y = \\partial_{k}$:\n$$\ng(\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i}), \\partial_{k}) = dx^{i}(\\partial_{k})\n$$\nThe right-hand side is, by definition of the dual basis, equal to the Kronecker delta:\n$$\ndx^{i}(\\partial_{k}) = \\delta^{i}_{k}\n$$\nFor the left-hand side, we substitute the linear combination for $\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i})$:\n$$\ng(\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i}), \\partial_{k}) = g\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A^{ij} \\partial_{j}, \\partial_{k} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of $g$ in its first argument and the definition of the metric components $g_{jk} = g(\\partial_j, \\partial_k)$:\n$$\ng\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A^{ij} \\partial_{j}, \\partial_{k} \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A^{ij} g(\\partial_{j}, \\partial_{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A^{ij} g_{jk}\n$$\nEquating the results for the left-hand and right-hand sides gives a system of linear equations for the coefficients $A^{ij}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n} A^{ij} g_{jk} = \\delta^{i}_{k}\n$$\nThis equation holds for each triplet of indices $(i, j, k)$. For fixed $i$, this is a matrix equation. Let $A$ be the matrix with entries $A^{ij}$ and $G$ be the matrix with entries $g_{jk}$. The equation is the definition of the matrix product $(AG)_{ik} = \\delta^{i}_{k}$. This means that the matrix $A$ is the left-inverse of the matrix $G$. For finite-dimensional square matrices, the left-inverse is the unique two-sided inverse.\nThe problem states that $(g^{ij})$ is the inverse matrix of $(g_{ij})$. Therefore, the matrix $A$ must be the matrix $(g^{ij})$.\n$$\nA^{ij} = g^{ij}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the linear combination gives the expression for $\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i})$:\n$$\n\\sharp_{g}(dx^{i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} g^{ij} \\partial_{j}\n$$\n\n**3. Composition $\\sharp_{g}\\circ\\flat_{g}$ and deduction of $g^{ik}g_{kj}$**\n\nFirst, we establish that the composition $\\sharp_{g}\\circ\\flat_{g}$ is the identity map on $TM$. Let $X$ be any vector field. Let $\\alpha = \\flat_{g}(X)$. Then, by definition, $Z = \\sharp_{g}(\\alpha)$ is the unique vector field such that $g(Z, Y) = \\alpha(Y)$ for all vector fields $Y$. Substituting the definition of $\\alpha$, we get:\n$$\ng(Z, Y) = \\flat_{g}(X)(Y) = g(X, Y)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as $g(Z-X, Y) = 0$ for all $Y$. Since the Riemannian metric $g$ is non-degenerate, this implies that $Z-X = 0$, or $Z=X$. Thus, $\\sharp_{g}(\\flat_{g}(X)) = X$ for all $X$, and $\\sharp_{g}\\circ\\flat_{g} = \\text{Id}_{TM}$.\n\nNow, we compute the components of $(\\sharp_{g}\\circ\\flat_{g})(\\partial_{j})$ in the basis $\\{\\partial_{i}\\}$. Since this is the identity map, the result must be $\\partial_{j}$ itself. Expressing $\\partial_{j}$ in the basis $\\{\\partial_{i}\\}$ yields:\n$$\n(\\sharp_{g}\\circ\\flat_{g})(\\partial_{j}) = \\partial_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\delta^{i}_{j} \\partial_{i}\n$$\nThe component corresponding to the basis vector $\\partial_i$ is $\\delta^{i}_{j}$.\n\nNext, we compute the same thing using the results from parts 1 and 2.\nApplying $\\flat_g$ to $\\partial_j$:\n$$\n\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{j}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} dx^{k}\n$$\nNow applying $\\sharp_g$ to this result, using the linearity of the map:\n$$\n\\sharp_{g}(\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{j})) = \\sharp_{g}\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} dx^{k} \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} \\sharp_{g}(dx^{k})\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\sharp_{g}(dx^{k})$ from part 2 (with index $i$ for the final summation):\n$$\n\\sharp_{g}(dx^{k}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g^{ki} \\partial_{i}\n$$\nPlugging this into the composition:\n$$\n\\sharp_{g}(\\flat_{g}(\\partial_{j})) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g^{ki} \\partial_{i} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} g^{ki} \\right) \\partial_{i}\n$$\nThe component of this vector in the basis $\\{\\partial_{i}\\}$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} g^{ki}$.\nEquating the two expressions for the components, we get:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} g^{ki} = \\delta^{i}_{j}\n$$\nThe expression $g^{ik}g_{kj}$ (with implicit summation over $k$) is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} g^{ik}g_{kj}$. This corresponds to the $(i,j)$-th entry of the matrix product $G^{-1}G$. By definition of the inverse matrix, $G^{-1}G = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. The $(i,j)$-th entry of the identity matrix is $\\delta^{i}_{j}$.\nTherefore, the contraction yields the Kronecker delta.\n$$\ng^{ik}g_{kj} \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g^{ik}g_{kj} = \\delta^{i}_{j}\n$$\nThis is consistent with the expression derived from considering the components of the identity map, as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} g_{jk} g^{ki} = (GG^{-1})_{ji}= \\delta_{j}^{i}$.
