This means $T(X,Y) = 0$ for all vector fields $X,Y$. The condition $T(X,Y)=0$ is precisely the statement $\\nabla_{X}Y - \\nabla_{Y}X - [X,Y] = 0$, which rearranges to $[X,Y] = \\nabla_{X}Y - \\nabla_{Y}X$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The Jacobi identity can be verified in coordinates by checking that, for any $X,Y,Z \\in \\mathfrak{X}\\left(M\\right)$ and each index $k$, one has $[X,[Y,Z]]^{k} + [Y,[Z,X]]^{k} + [Z,[X,Y]]^{k} = 0$, and this coordinate identity follows from the product rule and the commutativity of mixed partial derivatives.**\nThe Jacobi identity is $[X,[Y,Z]] + [Y,[Z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] = 0$. This vector equation is true if and only if it holds for each component in a local coordinate system. The identity itself follows abstractly from the definition of the Lie bracket as a commutator of operators, $[X,Y] = XY - YX$, in the associative algebra of differential operators.\nThe question is whether its verification *in coordinates* relies on the product rule and commutativity of partials. To verify it in coordinates, one must substitute the coordinate formula for the bracket (derived in A) into the Jacobi identity.\nFor instance, the $k$-th component of $[X,[Y,Z]]$ involves terms like $X^i \\partial_i ([Y,Z]^k)$. Expanding this using the product rule on the coordinate expression $[Y,Z]^k=Y^j\\partial_j Z^k - Z^j\\partial_j Y^k$ will generate terms involving second derivatives of component functions (e.g., $X^i Y^j \\partial_i\\partial_j Z^k$). When summing the three cyclic permutations, all second-derivative terms cancel out precisely because of the commutativity of mixed partial derivatives. The remaining first-derivative terms then cancel by algebraic rearrangement, which is guaranteed to work because the abstract identity holds. Therefore, the product rule and commutativity of partials are the essential tools for carrying out the verification in coordinates.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For any smooth function $f$ and any indices $i,j$, one has $[\\partial_{i}, f\\,\\partial_{j}] = (\\partial_{i}f)\\,\\partial_{j}$.**\nWe can verify this directly from the definition. Let $h$ be any smooth function.\n$[\\partial_{i}, f\\,\\partial_{j}](h) = \\partial_{i}((f\\,\\partial_{j})(h)) - (f\\,\\partial_{j})(\\partial_{i}(h))$\n$= \\partial_{i}(f (\\partial_{j}h)) - f \\partial_{j}(\\partial_{i}h)$\nUsing the product rule on the first term:\n$= (\\partial_{i}f)(\\partial_{j}h) + f(\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j}h) - f(\\partial_{j}\\partial_{i}h)$\nBy commutativity of mixed partial derivatives, $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j}h = \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i}h$. The last two terms cancel.\n$[\\partial_{i}, f\\,\\partial_{j}](h) = (\\partial_{i}f)(\\partial_{j}h)$\nThe right-hand side is the action of the vector field $(\\partial_{i}f)\\,\\partial_{j}$ on $h$. Since this holds for all $h$, the vector fields are equal.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. For any smooth functions $f,g$ and any vector fields $X,Y$, one has $[fX, gY] = fg\\,[X,Y]$.**\nThis statement claims that the Lie bracket is $C^\\infty(M)$-bilinear, which would make it a tensor field. This is false. The presence of derivatives in the coordinate formula (see A) indicates it is not a tensor. Let us derive the correct identity. Let $h$ be a test function.\n$[fX, gY](h) = (fX)((gY)(h)) - (gY)((fX)(h))$\n$= fX(gY(h)) - gY(fX(h))$\n$= f( (Xg)Y(h) + gX(Y(h)) ) - g( (Yf)X(h) + fY(X(h)) )$\n$= f(Xg)Y(h) + fgX(Y(h)) - g(Yf)X(h) - fgY(X(h))$\n$= fg(X(Y(h)) - Y(X(h))) + f(Xg)Y(h) - g(Yf)X(h)$\n$= fg[X,Y](h) + (f(Xg)Y - g(Yf)X)(h)$\nThus, the general identity is $[fX, gY] = fg[X,Y] + f(Xg)Y - g(Yf)X$. The additional terms $f(Xg)Y - g(Yf)X$ are generally non-zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. In a general coordinate chart on a curved manifold, one may have $[\\partial_{i},\\partial_{j}] \\neq 0$ because of curvature.**\nThis is a common misconception. The Lie bracket of coordinate basis vectors is always zero, regardless of curvature. We apply the definition with a test function $f$:\n$[\\partial_{i}, \\partial_{j}](f) = \\partial_{i}(\\partial_{j}f) - \\partial_{j}(\\partial_{i}f)$\nThe problem explicitly assumes the commutativity of mixed partial derivatives on smooth functions, i.e., $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j}f = \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i}f$. Thus,\n$[\\partial_{i}, \\partial_{j}](f) = 0$ for all $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$.\nThis implies that the vector field $[\\partial_{i}, \\partial_{j}]$ is the zero vector field. This property holds in any coordinate chart on any smooth manifold. Curvature is related to the non-commutativity of *covariant derivatives*, e.g., the Riemann curvature tensor is expressed via $R(\\partial_i, \\partial_j)\\partial_k = \\nabla_i\\nabla_j\\partial_k - \\nabla_j\\nabla_i\\partial_k$, which is non-zero in a curved manifold. The statement confuses the Lie bracket with the commutator of covariant derivatives.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "3042812"}]}
