A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds first by computing the Lie bracket of the given vector fields and then using this result to determine the involutivity of the distribution.\n\nLet the manifold be $M = \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The standard basis for the tangent space at any point is $\\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}\\}$. The given vector fields are $X = \\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}$ and $Y = \\partial_{y} + x\\,\\partial_{z}$.\n\nThe Lie bracket of two vector fields, $[X,Y]$, is itself a vector field. Its action on any smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined by $[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))$. We compute this quantity step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we find the action of $Y$ on $f$:\n$$Y(f) = (\\partial_{y} + x\\,\\partial_{z})(f) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNext, we apply $X$ to the resulting function $Y(f)$:\n$$X(Y(f)) = (\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z})\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\n$$= \\partial_{x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right) + y\\,\\partial_{z}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\nUsing the product rule for derivatives:\n$$= \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial(x)}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + x\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x \\partial z}\\right) + \\left(y\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z \\partial y} + y\\frac{\\partial(x)}{\\partial z}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + yx\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right)$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial(x)}{\\partial x} = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial(x)}{\\partial z} = 0$:\n$$X(Y(f)) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + x\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x \\partial z} + y\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z \\partial y} + yx\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}$$\n\nNow we compute the second term, $Y(X(f))$.

By definition, a distribution is involutive if for any two vector fields $V$ and $W$ that are sections of the distribution, their Lie bracket $[V,W]$ is also a section of the distribution. Since $D$ is spanned by $X$ and $Y$, this condition is satisfied if and only if the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ is a section of $D$.\nA vector field is a section of $D$ if it can be expressed as a linear combination of $X$ and $Y$ with smooth function coefficients. That is, we must check if there exist smooth functions $a, b: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $[X,Y] = aX + bY$.\nWe found that $[X,Y] = 0$. We can write the zero vector field as:\n$$0 = 0 \\cdot X + 0 \\cdot Y$$\nThe coefficient functions are $a(x,y,z) = 0$ and $b(x,y,z) = 0$. These are constant functions, which are smooth on $M$. Therefore, $[X,Y]$ is in the span of $X$ and $Y$ at every point, which means $[X,Y]$ is a section of $D$.\nWe conclude that the distribution $D$ is involutive. The indicator for this is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the three components of $[X,Y]$ followed by the involutivity indicator.\nComponents of $[X,Y]$: $(0,0,0)$.\nInvolutivity: $1$.\nThe resulting matrix is $(0, 0, 0, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3070865"}, {"introduction": "Not all distributions are integrable, and understanding why is as important as knowing when they are.

Therefore, $[X_1, X_2] \\in D$, and the distribution $D$ is involutive.\n\n**2. Procedure for Finding Local Defining Functions**\n\nAccording to the Frobenius theorem, since $D$ is involutive, it is integrable. This means that through every point in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, there passes a unique maximal integral submanifold of $D$, called a leaf. These leaves form a foliation of $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The problem statement asks for functions $f^3$ and $f^4$ that are constant on these leaves.\n\nA function $f$ is constant on the leaves of the foliation if and only if its directional derivative is zero along any vector field in the distribution $D$. This is equivalent to requiring that $f$ is annihilated by the basis vector fields of $D$:\n$$\nX_1(f) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad X_2(f) = 0.\n$$\nThis gives us a system of first-order linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for $f(x,y,z,w)$:\n\\begin{align*}\n(1) \\qquad  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 0 \\\\\n(2) \\qquad  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial w} = 0\n\\end{align*}\nThe procedure to find $f$ is to solve this system.\nFrom equation (2), we immediately see that $f$ must not depend on the variable $w$. Thus, $f$ is a function of only $x$, $y$, and $z$, i.e., $f(x,y,z,w) = g(x,y,z)$ for some function $g$.\nSubstituting this into equation (1), we get a single PDE for $g(x,y,z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = 0.\n$$\nThis is a homogeneous linear first-order PDE, which can be solved using the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dy}{0} = \\frac{dz}{y}.\n$$\nFrom the term $\\frac{dy}{0}$, we deduce that $dy=0$, which integrates to $y = c_1$ for some constant $c_1$. This gives our first characteristic integral, $u_1(x,y,z) = y$.\nNext, we use the relation $\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dz}{y}$. Along a characteristic curve, $y$ is constant, so $y=c_1$. The equation becomes $dz = c_1 dx$. Integrating this yields $z = c_1 x + c_2$, where $c_2$ is another constant of integration. We can solve for $c_2$ to find the second characteristic integral: $c_2 = z - c_1 x$. Substituting back $c_1=y$, we get $u_2(x,y,z) = z - yx$.\n\nThe general solution $g(x,y,z)$ to the PDE is an arbitrary smooth function of these two characteristic integrals, $g(x,y,z) = \\Phi(u_1, u_2) = \\Phi(y, z-yx)$. Consequently, the general solution for $f$ is:\n$$\nf(x,y,z,w) = \\Phi(y, z-yx).\n$$\nTo obtain two specific functions $f^3$ and $f^4$ whose differentials are linearly independent, we can choose the simplest non-constant functionally independent functions of $y$ and $z-yx$. The most straightforward choice is to take the characteristic integrals themselves.\n\n**3. Explicit Formulas for $f^3$ and $f^4$**\n\nFollowing the procedure derived above, we set $f^3$ and $f^4$ to be the two characteristic integrals we found:\n$$\nf^3(x,y,z,w) = y\n$$\n$$\nf^4(x,y,z,w) = z - yx\n$$\nTo complete the problem, we must verify that their differentials, $df^3$ and $df^4$, are linearly independent on an open set.\nThe differential of $f^3$ is:\n$$\ndf^3 = \\frac{\\partial (y)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial (y)}{\\partial y}dy + \\frac{\\partial (y)}{\\partial z}dz + \\frac{\\partial (y)}{\\partial w}dw = dy.\n$$\nThe differential of $f^4$ is:\n$$\ndf^4 = \\frac{\\partial (z-yx)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial (z-yx)}{\\partial y}dy + \\frac{\\partial (z-yx)}{\\partial z}dz + \\frac{\\partial (z-yx)}{\\partial w}dw = -y\\,dx - x\\,dy + 1\\,dz.\n$$\nThe covectors $df^3$ and $df^4$ are linearly dependent if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other, i.e., $df^4 = c \\cdot df^3$ for some scalar function $c$.\n$$\n-y\\,dx - x\\,dy + dz = c \\cdot dy.\n$$\nEquating the coefficients of the basis covectors $\\{dx, dy, dz, dw\\}$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Coefficient of $dx$: $-y = 0$.\n    \\item Coefficient of $dy$: $-x = c$.\n    \\item Coefficient of $dz$: $1 = 0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe condition $1=0$ is a contradiction. Therefore, $df^3$ and $df^4$ are linearly independent everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nThus, the functions $f^3 = y$ and $f^4 = z-yx$ satisfy all the required conditions. They are constant along the integral manifolds of $D$, and their differentials are linearly independent, serving as local (and in this case, global) transverse coordinates to the leaves of the foliation.\nNote that other valid choices exist, for instance $yx-z$, which is simply $-f^4$. Any pair of functions $\\Psi_1(y, z-yx)$ and $\\Psi_2(y, z-yx)$ would also be a solution, provided their Jacobian with respect to $(y, z-yx)$ is non-zero. The choice of $y$ and $z-yx$ is the most direct from the method of characteristics.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} y  z - yx \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3070832"}]}
