Thus, $\\gamma$ is a smooth map.\n\n2.  **Immersion**: We compute the velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$ and check if it is ever the zero vector $(0,0)$.\n    $$ \\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = \\big(2\\cos(2t),\\, \\cos t\\big) $$\n    For $\\gamma'(t)$ to be $(0,0)$, both components must be zero.\n    $$ \\cos t = 0 \\implies t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi \\text{ for } k \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\n    Let's test these values of $t$ in the first component, $2\\cos(2t)$.\n    -   If $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $2t = \\pi$, and $2\\cos(\\pi) = -2 \\neq 0$.\n    -   If $t = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, then $2t = 3\\pi$, and $2\\cos(3\\pi) = -2 \\neq 0$.\n    Since $\\cos t$ and $2\\cos(2t)$ are never simultaneously zero, the velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$ is never $(0,0)$. Therefore, $\\gamma$ is a smooth immersion.\n\n3.  **Self-intersection (Figure-eight shape)**: We seek $t_1, t_2 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ with $t_1 \\neq t_2$ such that $\\gamma(t_1) = \\gamma(t_2)$.\n    $$ \\begin{cases} \\sin(2t_1) = \\sin(2t_2) \\\\ \\sin(t_1) = \\sin(t_2) \\end{cases} $$\n    From $\\sin(t_1) = \\sin(t_2)$ with $t_1 \\neq t_2$, we must have $t_2 = \\pi - t_1$ (assuming $0 < t_1 < \\pi$). Substituting this into the first equation:\n    $$ \\sin(2t_1) = \\sin(2(\\pi - t_1)) = \\sin(2\\pi - 2t_1) = -\\sin(2t_1) $$\n    This implies $2\\sin(2t_1) = 0$, so $\\sin(2t_1) = 0$. This occurs when $2t_1 = k\\pi$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, which means $t_1 = k\\pi/2$.\n    Let's check values of $t_1$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n    -   If $t_1=0$, then $t_2 = \\pi$. We have $\\gamma(0) = (\\sin 0, \\sin 0) = (0,0)$ and $\\gamma(\\pi) = (\\sin(2\\pi), \\sin \\pi) = (0,0)$.

This is characteristic of a figure-eight curve (specifically, the lemniscate of Gerono).\n\n4.  **Transverse Intersection**: We evaluate the tangent vectors at the intersection times $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$.\n    -   $\\gamma'(0) = \\big(2\\cos(0), \\cos(0)\\big) = (2, 1)$\n    -   $\\gamma'(\\pi) = \\big(2\\cos(2\\pi), \\cos(\\pi)\\big) = (2, -1)$\n    The tangent vectors $(2, 1)$ and $(2, -1)$ are not scalar multiples of each other; they are linearly independent. Thus, the self-intersection is transverse.\n\n5.  **Failure to be an Embedding**: An embedding must be a homeomorphism onto its image. A necessary condition for this is that the map must be injective. Since we found $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(\\pi)$ for distinct points $0, \\pi \\in S^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$, the map $\\gamma$ is not injective. Therefore, it cannot be an embedding.\n\nThe explanation provided in option A aligns perfectly with our analysis. It correctly identifies the map, verifies it's an immersion, demonstrates its non-injectivity via $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(\\pi)$, correctly concludes it's not an embedding for this reason, and notes the transverse crossing.\n\n**Verdict for A:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThe proposed map is $\\gamma(t) = \\big(\\cos t,\\, \\sin t\\big)$. This is the standard parametrization of the unit circle. The image is a circle, which has no self-intersections. The statement claims the image is a \"figure-eight with a self-intersection at $(0,0)$,\" which is factually incorrect. The curve does not pass through $(0,0)$. This map is a classic example of an embedding of $S^1$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**Verdict for B:** Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThe proposed map is $\\gamma(t) = \\big(\\cos(2t),\\, \\sin(2t)\\big)$. As $t$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the argument $2t$ varies from $0$ to $4\\pi$. This map traces the unit circle twice. The image is the unit circle, which is not a figure-eight curve. The statement \"it is a figure-eight because it traces the unit circle twice\" is a nonsensical description of a figure-eight. While this map is not an embedding (because it is not injective; e.g., $\\gamma(0)=\\gamma(\\pi)$), its image is not a figure-eight.\n\n**Verdict for C:** Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThe proposed map is $\\gamma(t) = \\big(\\sin t,\\, \\sin(2t)\\big)$. This is a rotation of the curve in Option A. It is also a smooth immersion forming a figure-eight with a self-intersection at the origin (for $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$). So the first part of the statement is correct. However, the explanation states: \"...and it is an embedding because immersions into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are automatically embeddings when the image is a plane curve.\" This claim is false.\n-   First, the map is not an embedding. As shown, it is not injective, so it cannot be an embedding. The conclusion that it is an embedding is wrong.\n-   Second, the reasoning is fallacious. An immersion from a compact manifold (like $S^1$) is an embedding if and only if it is injective. The figure-eight curve is the canonical counterexample to the claim that all immersions are embeddings. The qualifying phrase \"when the image is a plane curve\" is redundant for a map into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and does not alter the incorrectness of the statement.\n\n**Verdict for D:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of all options, only option A provides a correct example and a correct, complete explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3045021"}, {"introduction": "How can we rigorously prove that familiar geometric shapes, such as spheres, are indeed smooth manifolds?

We define a function $F : \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $F(x) = \\|x\\|^{2}$. In coordinates $x=(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{n+1})$, this function is given by $F(x_1, \\ldots, x_{n+1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i^2$.

By its definition, the sphere $S^{n}$ is precisely the level set of $F$ corresponding to the value $1$, i.e., $S^{n} = F^{-1}(1)$.\n\nTo show that $1$ is a regular value of $F$, we must verify that for every point $p \\in F^{-1}(1) = S^{n}$, the differential of $F$ at $p$, denoted $dF_p$, is a surjective linear map.

This is equivalent to its representing matrix, $2p^T$, not being the zero matrix.

We invoke the Regular Value Theorem (or Preimage Theorem). This fundamental result of differential topology states that if $F: M \\to N$ is a smooth map between smooth manifolds and $c \\in N$ is a regular value of $F$, then the level set $F^{-1}(c)$ is a properly embedded submanifold of $M$.\nIn our case, we have a smooth map $F : \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and we have just shown that $1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a regular value. Applying the theorem with $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $N=\\mathbb{R}$, we conclude that $S^{n} = F^{-1}(1)$ is an embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nThe theorem also provides the dimension of the submanifold: $\\dim(F^{-1}(c)) = \\dim(M) - \\dim(N)$.\nThe dimension of the ambient space is $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}) = n+1$.

For a submanifold defined as the regular level set of a function, its tangent space at a point is given by the kernel of the differential of the function at that point.
