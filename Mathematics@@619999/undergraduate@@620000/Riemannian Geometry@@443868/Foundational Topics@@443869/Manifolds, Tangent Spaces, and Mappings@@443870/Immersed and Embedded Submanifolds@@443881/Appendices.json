Since $\\mathbb{S}^{1}$ is a compact space and $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a Hausdorff space, any continuous injective map from $\\mathbb{S}^{1}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a homeomorphism onto its image. A smooth map is continuous. Therefore, an immersion $f: \\mathbb{S}^{1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is an embedding if and only if it is injective.\n\nThe problem asks for maps that are immersions but are not embeddings. This is equivalent to finding maps that are immersions but are not injective.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\n**A. $f(\\theta)=(\\cos\\theta,\\sin\\theta)$**\n1.  **Check for immersion**: The derivative is $f'(\\theta) = (-\\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta)$. The squared norm of the derivative is $\\|f'(\\theta)\\|^2 = (-\\sin\\theta)^2 + (\\cos\\theta)^2 = \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$.

This means $(\\cos\\theta_1, \\sin\\theta_1) = (\\cos\\theta_2, \\sin\\theta_2)$. This equality holds if and only if $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe smooth map is given by $\\gamma:\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ where $\\mathbb{S}^{1}=\\{t \\in \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\}$ and $\\gamma(t)=(\\sin t,\\sin 2t)$.\n\n1. To verify that $\\gamma$ is an immersion, we must show that its differential $d\\gamma_{t}:\\mathrm{T}_{t}\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\to\\mathrm{T}_{\\gamma(t)}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is injective for all $t\\in\\mathbb{S}^{1}$. The tangent space $\\mathrm{T}_{t}\\mathbb{S}^{1}$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space spanned by the tangent vector $\\frac{d}{dt}$. The differential $d\\gamma_t$ maps this basis vector to the velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$ in $\\mathrm{T}_{\\gamma(t)}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which we identify with $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The map $d\\gamma_t$ is injective if and only if $\\gamma'(t) \\neq (0,0)$.\n\nWe compute the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\n\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\sin t, \\sin 2t) = (\\cos t, 2\\cos 2t)\n$$\nFor $d\\gamma_t$ to fail to be injective, we would need $\\gamma'(t)=(0,0)$, which requires both components to be zero simultaneously:\n$$\n\\cos t = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2\\cos 2t = 0\n$$\nThe first equation, $\\cos t=0$, holds for $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. We must check if the second equation holds for these values of $t$. Using the double-angle identity $\\cos 2t = 2\\cos^2 t - 1$, we see that if $\\cos t = 0$, then:\n$$\n\\cos 2t = 2(0)^2 - 1 = -1\n$$\nSo, when $\\cos t = 0$, the second component of the derivative is $2\\cos 2t = 2(-1) = -2 \\neq 0$. The two components of $\\gamma'(t)$ are never simultaneously zero. Thus, $\\gamma'(t) \\neq (0,0)$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$. This proves that the differential $d\\gamma_t$ is injective for all $t$, and therefore $\\gamma$ is an immersion.\n\n2. The constant rank theorem states that if a smooth map between manifolds has constant rank in a neighborhood of a point, its local form is particularly simple. As shown in part 1, the rank of the differential $d\\gamma_t$ is the dimension of the image of the tangent space $\\mathrm{T}_{t}\\mathbb{S}^{1}$, which is a $1$-dimensional space. Since $d\\gamma_t$ is injective for all $t$, the dimension of its image is always $1$. Therefore, the rank of $\\gamma$ is constant and equal to $1$ everywhere on $\\mathbb{S}^1$.\n\nBy the specialization of the constant rank theorem for immersions, for every $t_0 \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $t_0$ in $\\mathbb{S}^1$ and a chart $(V, \\phi)$ for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ around $\\gamma(t_0)$ such that $\\gamma(U) \\subset V$ and the map $\\phi \\circ \\gamma$ on $U$ is given by $t \\mapsto (t, 0)$ (in appropriate local coordinates). A map that can be locally represented this way is a local embedding. An embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. Since $\\gamma$ is locally equivalent to a standard inclusion map, which is a homeomorphism onto its image, $\\gamma$ is a homeomorphism from a sufficiently small neighborhood of any point $t \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$ to its image $\\gamma(U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. A homeomorphism is by definition injective, so $\\gamma$ must be locally injective.\n\n3. To show that $\\gamma$ is not globally injective, we need to find distinct points $t, s \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$ (i.e., $t \\not\\equiv s \\pmod{2\\pi}$) such that $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma(s)$. This requires solving the system of equations:\n$$\n\\sin t = \\sin s\n$$\n$$\n\\sin 2t = \\sin 2s\n$$\nFor $t,s$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ with $t \\neq s$, the first equation $\\sin t = \\sin s$ implies $s = \\pi - t$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$\n\\sin(2(\\pi-t)) = \\sin(2\\pi - 2t) = -\\sin(2t)\n$$\nThe second equation then becomes $\\sin(2t) = -\\sin(2t)$, which simplifies to $2\\sin(2t) = 0$, or $\\sin(2t)=0$. This condition is satisfied when $2t = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$, which means $t = k\\pi/2$.\n\nLet's test these values for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$:\n- If $t=0$, then $s = \\pi-0 = \\pi$. We have $\\gamma(0) = (\\sin 0, \\sin 0) = (0,0)$ and $\\gamma(\\pi) = (\\sin \\pi, \\sin 2\\pi) = (0,0)$. Since $0 \\neq \\pi$ in $\\mathbb{S}^1$, we have found distinct points with the same image.\n- If $t=\\pi/2$, then $s = \\pi - \\pi/2 = \\pi/2$, so $s=t$, which is not a pair of distinct points.\n- If $t=\\pi$, then $s = \\pi - \\pi = 0$, which is the same pair as the first case.\n- If $t=3\\pi/2$, then $s = \\pi - 3\\pi/2 = -\\pi/2$, which is equivalent to $3\\pi/2 \\pmod{2\\pi}$, so $s=t$.\n\nThus, $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(\\pi) = (0,0)$, demonstrating that $\\gamma$ is not globally injective.\n\n4. An $n$-dimensional subset $X$ of a manifold $M$ is an embedded submanifold if for every point $p \\in X$, there exists a chart $(U, \\phi)$ on $M$ around $p$ such that $X \\cap U$ is mapped by $\\phi$ to the slice $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\{0\\}$ intersected with $\\phi(U)$. For a $1$-dimensional embedded submanifold in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this means that near any point $p \\in X$, the set $X$ must look locally like a straight line (in some coordinate system). Topologically, this implies that for every $p \\in X$, there is a neighborhood of $p$ in $X$ (with the subspace topology) that is homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet's examine the point $p=(0,0) \\in X = \\gamma(\\mathbb{S}^1)$. As we found in part 3, this point is the image of two distinct points, $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$.\nNear $t=0$, $\\gamma(t) = (\\sin t, \\sin 2t) \\approx (t, 2t)$ for small $t$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(0) = (1, 2)$.\nNear $t=\\pi$, let $u=t-\\pi$. Then $t = \\pi+u$, and for small $u$, $\\gamma(\\pi+u) = (\\sin(\\pi+u), \\sin(2\\pi+2u)) = (-\\sin u, \\sin 2u) \\approx (-u, 2u)$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(\\pi)=(-1,2)$.\nSo, near the origin $(0,0)$, the image $X$ consists of two distinct curves crossing. Any open neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $X$ (with the subspace topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^2$) resembles a cross shape 'X'.\n\nLet $N$ be such a neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $X$. If we remove the point $(0,0)$ from $N$, the resulting set $N \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ has four connected components. However, if we take any neighborhood in a $1$-dimensional manifold (which must be homeomorphic to an open interval $(a,b) \\subset \\mathbb{R}$) and remove a point, the resulting set has at most two connected components. Since the number of connected components is a topological invariant, no neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $X$ can be homeomorphic to an open interval. Therefore, $X$ is not a topological manifold, and consequently it cannot be an embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The slice chart condition fails at the self-intersection point $(0,0)$.\n\n5. The image $X = \\gamma(\\mathbb{S}^1)$ is a figure-eight curve. We model this as a $1$-dimensional finite cell complex (a graph).\nA cell complex decomposition is given by:\n- $0$-cells (vertices): There is one self-intersection point at $(0,0)$. This is the natural candidate for a vertex. Let $v_0$ be this vertex. The number of vertices is $V=1$.\n- $1$-cells (edges): The curve consists of two loops that start and end at the vertex $v_0$. One loop is the image $\\gamma((0,\\pi))$, and the other is the image $\\gamma((\\pi, 2\\pi))$. These correspond to two distinct edges, $e_1$ and $e_2$. The number of edges is $E=2$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ for a cell complex is given by the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension:\n$$\n\\chi(X) = (\\text{number of 0-cells}) - (\\text{number of 1-cells})\n$$\nIn our model:\n$$\n\\chi(X) = V - E = 1 - 2 = -1\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the fact that the figure-eight curve $X$ is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of two circles, $\\mathbb{S}^1 \\vee \\mathbb{S}^1$.

These vectors are computed as the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to the coordinates $u$ and $v$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative vectors:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\cos v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v,\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v,\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\cos v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u\\right)\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v,\\ \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v,\\ 0\\right) $$\nTo check for linear independence in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, we compute their cross product:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\times \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\cos v & \\frac{1}{2}\\sin v & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{u}{2}\\sin v & \\frac{u}{2}\\cos v & 0 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ = \\mathbf{i}\\left(0 - \\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v\\right) - \\mathbf{j}\\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v\\right)\\right) + \\mathbf{k}\\left(\\frac{u}{4}\\cos^2 v - \\left(-\\frac{u}{4}\\sin^2 v\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ = \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v,\\ -\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v,\\ \\frac{u}{4}(\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v)\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v,\\ -\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v,\\ \\frac{u}{4}\\right) $$\nThe vectors are linearly independent if and only if their cross product is non-zero. We compute the magnitude of the cross product:\n$$ \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\times \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u}{4}\\right)^2} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{\\frac{3u^2}{16}\\cos^2 v + \\frac{3u^2}{16}\\sin^2 v + \\frac{u^2}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3u^2}{16}(\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v) + \\frac{u^2}{16}} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{\\frac{3u^2}{16} + \\frac{u^2}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4u^2}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{u^2}{4}} = \\frac{|u|}{2} $$\nThe domain for $u$ is the interval $[1,2]$, so $u \\ge 1$. Thus, the magnitude is $\\frac{u}{2} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$, which is never zero. Since the cross product is never the zero vector on $M$, the vectors $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u}$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v}$ are linearly independent at every point of $M$. Therefore, $F$ is an immersion.\n\n**Part 2: Show that $F$ is an embedding.**\nAn embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. We have already shown $F$ is an immersion. A map is a homeomorphism onto its image if it is injective and the inverse map $F^{-1}: F(M) \\to M$ is continuous.\n\nFirst, we check injectivity. Suppose $F(u_1, v_1) = F(u_2, v_2)$ for $(u_1, v_1)$ and $(u_2, v_2)$ in $M$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{u_1}{2} \\cos v_1,\\ \\frac{u_1}{2} \\sin v_1,\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_1\\right) = \\left(\\frac{u_2}{2} \\cos v_2,\\ \\frac{u_2}{2} \\sin v_2,\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_2\\right) $$\nEquating the third components gives $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_2$, which implies $u_1 = u_2$.\nSince $u_1 = u_2$ and $u \\in [1,2]$ (so $u \\ne 0$), we can simplify the first two component equations:\n$$ \\frac{u_1}{2} \\cos v_1 = \\frac{u_1}{2} \\cos v_2 \\implies \\cos v_1 = \\cos v_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{u_1}{2} \\sin v_1 = \\frac{u_1}{2} \\sin v_2 \\implies \\sin v_1 = \\sin v_2 $$\nThese two equations imply that $v_1$ and $v_2$ represent the same point on the unit circle $S^{1}$. Thus, $(u_1, v_1) = (u_2, v_2)$ as points in $M = [1,2] \\times S^1$. The map $F$ is injective.\n\nNext, we must show that $F^{-1}: F(M) \\to M$ is continuous. A general theorem states that a continuous injection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism onto its image. The target space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a metric space, and thus is Hausdorff. The domain $M = [1,2] \\times S^{1}$ is the product of two compact spaces: The interval $[1,2]$ is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}$, hence compact. The circle $S^{1}$ is also compact. The product of two compact spaces is compact, so $M$ is compact. The map $F$ is continuous because its component functions are compositions of polynomials and trigonometric functions, which are continuous.\nSince $F$ is a continuous injection from a compact space $M$ to a Hausdorff space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, it is a homeomorphism onto its image $F(M)$.\nBecause $F$ is an immersion and a homeomorphism onto its image, it is an embedding. The image $F(M)$ is a smooth embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\n**Part 3: Verify that $F$ is an isometry.**\nWe need to show that the pullback of the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ via $F$ is precisely the metric $g$ on $M$. That is, we must verify $F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle = g$.\nThe pullback metric tensor components $(F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle)_{ij}$ in the $(u,v)$ coordinates are given by $g_{ij} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^j} \\right\\rangle$, where $(x^1, x^2)=(u,v)$.\nWe compute the components $g_{uu}$, $g_{uv}$, and $g_{vv}$:\n$$ g_{uu} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v, \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v, \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\cos^2 v + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin^2 v + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v) + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 $$\n$$ g_{vv} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v, 0\\right), \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v, 0\\right) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ = \\left(-\\frac{u}{2}\\sin v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\cos v\\right)^2 + 0^2 = \\frac{u^2}{4}\\sin^2 v + \\frac{u^2}{4}\\cos^2 v = \\frac{u^2}{4}(\\sin^2 v + \\cos^2 v) = \\frac{u^2}{4} = \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ g_{uv} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v, \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v, 0\\right) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos v\\right)\\left(-\\frac{u}{2}\\sin v\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin v\\right)\\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\cos v\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)(0) = -\\frac{u}{4}\\cos v \\sin v + \\frac{u}{4}\\sin v \\cos v = 0 $$\nThe pullback metric is therefore $F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle = g_{uu}\\,du^2 + 2 g_{uv}\\,du\\,dv + g_{vv}\\,dv^2 = (1)du^2 + 2(0)du\\,dv + \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 dv^2$.\nThis simplifies to $du^2 + \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 dv^2$, which is exactly the metric $g$ given for the manifold $M$.\nThus, $F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle = g$, and $F$ is an isometry between $(M,g)$ and its image $F(M)$ with the induced metric.\n\n**Part 4: Compute the total area of the embedded surface $F(M)$.**\nThe area of the surface $F(M)$ is found by integrating the area element over the domain of parametrization. The area element $dA$ is derived from the metric tensor. For a metric represented by the matrix $G = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{uu} & g_{uv} \\\\ g_{vu} & g_{vv} \\end{pmatrix}$, the area element is $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(G)} \\,du\\,dv$.\nThe metric is the induced metric, which we've just shown has components $g_{uu}=1$, $g_{vv}=(u/2)^2$, and $g_{uv}=g_{vu}=0$. So, the matrix of the metric is:\n$$ G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(G) = (1)\\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 - (0)(0) = \\frac{u^2}{4}$.\nThe area element is $dA = \\sqrt{\\frac{u^2}{4}} \\,du\\,dv = \\frac{|u|}{2}\\,du\\,dv$. Since $u \\in [1,2]$, $|u|=u$, and so $dA = \\frac{u}{2}\\,du\\,dv$.\nNote that this is consistent with the magnitude of the cross product calculated in Part 1, as expected: $dA = \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\times \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\| \\,du\\,dv$.\nThe total area is the integral of this element over the domain $u \\in [1,2]$ and $v \\in [0, 2\\pi]$:\n$$ \\text{Area}(F(M)) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{u}{2} \\,du\\,dv $$\nWe evaluate the inner integral with respect to $u$:\n$$ \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{u}{2} \\,du = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{u^2}{2} \\right]_{1}^{2} = \\frac{1}{4} [u^2]_{1}^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}(2^2 - 1^2) = \\frac{1}{4}(4 - 1) = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nNow, we evaluate the outer integral with respect to $v$:\n$$ \\text{Area}(F(M)) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{3}{4} \\,dv = \\frac{3}{4} [v]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{4}(2\\pi - 0) = \\frac{6\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} $$\nThe total area of the embedded surface $F(M)$ is $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3050746"}]}
