A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem consists of three parts: constructing the differential of the map $f$, finding the preimage of a specific point $v$, and calculating the rank of the differential at the points in the preimage.\n\n**Part 1: Construct the differential $d f_{(x,y)}$**\n\nThe map is $f: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, given by $f(x,y) = (x^{2}, xy, y^{2})$.\nLet the component functions be $f_1(x,y) = x^2$, $f_2(x,y) = xy$, and $f_3(x,y) = y^2$.\nThe differential of $f$ at a point $p=(x,y)$, denoted $df_p$ or $df_{(x,y)}$, is the linear map whose matrix representation with respect to the standard bases of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the Jacobian matrix, $J_f(x,y)$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is a $3 \\times 2$ matrix of partial derivatives:\n$$\nJ_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2) = 2x$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2) = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy) = y$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(xy) = x$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2) = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2) = 2y$\n\nSubstituting these into the matrix, we get the Jacobian of $f$ at an arbitrary point $(x,y)$:\n$$\nJ_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2x & 0 \\\\\ny & x \\\\\n0 & 2y\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix represents the linear map $d f_{(x,y)}: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Given a tangent vector $(v_1, v_2) \\in T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, its image under $df_{(x,y)}$ is:\n$$\ndf_{(x,y)}(v_1, v_2) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2x & 0 \\\\\ny & x \\\\\n0 & 2y\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_1 \\\\\nv_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n2xv_1 \\\\\nyv_1 + xv_2 \\\\\n2yv_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Determine the preimage $f^{-1}(v)$**\n\nWe are given the target value $v = (1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$. We need to find all points $p=(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $f(p) = v$. This leads to the following system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 = 1 \\\\\nxy = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\ny^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $x^2 = 1$, we obtain $x = 1$ or $x = -1$.\nFrom the third equation, $y^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, we obtain $y = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $y = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe must check which pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the second equation, $xy = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n1. If $x=1$ and $y=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (1)(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is a solution. Let $p_1 = (1, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n2. If $x=1$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (1)(-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$. This is not a solution.\n3. If $x=-1$ and $y=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$. This is not a solution.\n4. If $x=-1$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{2}$, then $xy = (-1)(-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is a solution. Let $p_2 = (-1, -\\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nThus, the set of points in the preimage of $v$ is $f^{-1}(v) = \\{ (1, \\frac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\}$.\n\n**Part 3: Compute the rank of $d f_{p}$ at $p \\in f^{-1}(v)$**\n\nThe rank of the linear map $d f_{p}$ is equal to the rank of its matrix representation, the Jacobian matrix $J_f(p)$. We compute this rank for each point in $f^{-1}(v)$.\n\nFor $p_1 = (1, \\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$\nJ_f(1, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2(1) & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\\\\n0 & 2(\\frac{1}{2})\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent columns (or rows). The columns of this matrix are $C_1 = (2, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)^T$ and $C_2 = (0, 1, 1)^T$. These two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent. Since there are $2$ columns, the rank of this matrix is $2$.\nAlternatively, we can find a $2\\times 2$ submatrix with a non-zero determinant. For instance, the submatrix formed by the first two rows has determinant $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(1) - (0)(\\frac{1}{2}) = 2 \\neq 0$. Thus, the rank is at least $2$. As the matrix has only $2$ columns, its rank cannot exceed $2$. Therefore, the rank is exactly $2$.\n\nFor $p_2 = (-1, -\\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$\nJ_f(-1, -\\frac{1}{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2(-1) & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\\\\n0 & 2(-\\frac{1}{2})\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe columns are $C_1 = (-2, -\\frac{1}{2}, 0)^T$ and $C_2 = (0, -1, -1)^T$. These are also clearly linearly independent. The rank is $2$.\nUsing the minor method, the submatrix of the first two rows has determinant $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-2)(-1) - (0)(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 2 \\neq 0$. The rank is therefore $2$.\n\nFor any point $p \\in f^{-1}(v)$, the rank of the differential $d f_{p}$ is $2$.\nThis implies that $f$ is an immersion at these points, since the rank of the differential ($2$) is equal to the dimension of the domain manifold ($\\mathbb{R}^2$).\nThe problem asks for the rank as a single integer. This rank is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3052904"}, {"introduction": "While an immersion guarantees that a map behaves well locally by preserving tangent space structures, it does not rule out global complexities like self-intersections.

We will address each task in sequence.\n\nFirst, we verify that $f$ is an immersion at every point of $S^1$.\nA smooth map $f: M \\to N$ is an immersion if its differential $d f_{p}$ is injective for every $p \\in M$. For our map $f:S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, the domain is a $1$-dimensional manifold. The tangent space $T_{\\theta}S^1$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space spanned by the vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$. The differential $d f_{\\theta}$ maps this basis vector to the tangent vector of the curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is given by the derivative of $f$ with respect to $\\theta$.\nLet's compute this derivative:\n$$\nf'(\\theta) = \\frac{df}{d\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sin(2\\theta), \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)\\right) = (2\\cos(2\\theta), \\cos(\\theta)).\n$$\nThe differential $d f_{\\theta}$ is injective if and only if this tangent vector $f'(\\theta)$ is non-zero for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. We check if there exists any $\\theta$ for which $f'(\\theta)=(0,0)$. This would require both components to be zero simultaneously:\n$$\n2\\cos(2\\theta) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos(\\theta) = 0.\n$$\nFrom the second equation, $\\cos(\\theta) = 0$, the solutions in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ are $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nWe check if the first equation, $\\cos(2\\theta)=0$, holds for these values.\n- For $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $2\\theta = \\pi$. Then $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$. This is not $0$.\n- For $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, we have $2\\theta = 3\\pi$. Then $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos(3\\pi) = -1$. This is also not $0$.\nSince the two components of the tangent vector $f'(\\theta)$ are never simultaneously zero for any $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the vector $f'(\\theta)$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, the differential $d f_{\\theta}$ is injective for all $\\theta \\in S^{1}$, and $f$ is an immersion.\n\nSecond, we show that $f$ is not an embedding.\nAn embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. A necessary condition for a map to be a homeomorphism onto its image is that the map must be injective. We will show that $f$ is not injective on $S^1$. To do this, we need to find two distinct parameter values $\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2} \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, with $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$, such that $f(\\theta_{1}) = f(\\theta_{2})$.\nLet's test the values $\\theta_{1}=0$ and $\\theta_{2}=\\pi$. These are distinct in $[0, 2\\pi)$.\nFor $\\theta_{1}=0$:\n$$\nf(0) = (\\sin(2 \\cdot 0), \\sin(0)) = (\\sin(0), \\sin(0)) = (0,0).\n$$\nFor $\\theta_{2}=\\pi$:\n$$\nf(\\pi) = (\\sin(2\\pi), \\sin(\\pi)) = (0,0).\n$$\nSince $f(0) = f(\\pi)$ and $0 \\neq \\pi$, the map $f$ is not injective. A non-injective map cannot be a homeomorphism onto its image. Therefore, $f$ is not an embedding. The image of the curve self-intersects at the point $(0,0)$.\n\nThird, we solve explicitly for all pairs $(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2})$ corresponding to self-intersections.\nWe are looking for all pairs $(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}) \\in [0, 2\\pi)^2$ with $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$ such that $f(\\theta_{1}) = f(\\theta_{2})$. This equality gives rise to a system of two equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n    \\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = \\sin(2\\theta_{2}) & (1) \\\\\n    \\sin(\\theta_{1}) = \\sin(\\theta_{2}) & (2)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom equation $(2)$, for $\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2} \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$, it must be that $\\theta_{2} = \\pi - \\theta_{1}$. Let's substitute this into equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = \\sin(2(\\pi - \\theta_{1})) = \\sin(2\\pi - 2\\theta_{1}) = -\\sin(2\\theta_{1}).\n$$\nThis equation simplifies to $2\\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = 0$, which means $\\sin(2\\theta_{1}) = 0$.\nFor $\\theta_{1} \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, $2\\theta_{1}$ is in $[0, 4\\pi)$. The solutions for $2\\theta_{1}$ are $0, \\pi, 2\\pi, 3\\pi$.\nThis gives the possible values for $\\theta_{1}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{1} = 0, \\quad \\theta_{1} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\quad \\theta_{1} = \\pi, \\quad \\theta_{1} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}.\n$$\nNow we find the corresponding $\\theta_{2} = \\pi - \\theta_{1}$ for each case and check if $\\theta_{1} \\neq \\theta_{2}$ and both are in $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n- If $\\theta_{1} = 0$, then $\\theta_{2} = \\pi - 0 = \\pi$. We have $0 \\neq \\pi$, and both are in $[0, 2\\pi)$. This gives the pair $(0, \\pi)$.\n- If $\\theta_{1} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $\\theta_{2} = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

Consider the function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by:\n$$f(x,y) = y^{2} - x^{3}$$\nThis function is a polynomial, and is therefore smooth (i.e., of class $C^{\\infty}$) on all of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nLet's verify that this function meets the requirements.\nThe partial derivatives of $f$ are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^{2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$$\nAt the point $(0,0)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(0,0) = -3(0)^{2}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(0,0) = 2(0)=0$. Therefore, the differential $d f_{(0,0)}$ is the zero map, and $(0,0)$ is a critical point of $f$.\nFurthermore, the value of the function at this critical point is $f(0,0)=0^{2}-0^{3}=0$. By definition, this means $0$ is a critical value of $f$. The chosen function is valid.\n\nNext, we analyze the level set $S = f^{-1}(0) = \\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid y^{2}-x^{3}=0\\}$.\nThe problem asks to identify the singular points of this set. A point $q \\in S$ is a singular point of the level set if it is a critical point of the function $f$. We have already found that the only critical point of $f$ is $(0,0)$. Since $f(0,0)=0$, the point $(0,0)$ lies in the level set $S$. Thus, $(0,0)$ is the unique singular point of the level set $f^{-1}(0)$.\n\nNow, we must verify that away from this singular point, the level set is a smooth embedded $1$-dimensional submanifold. Consider any point $q=(x,y)\\in S$ such that $q\\neq(0,0)$. For such a point, we have $y^{2}=x^{3}$. If $y\\neq 0$, then the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(q) = 2y \\neq 0$. If $y=0$, then $x^{3}=0$, which implies $x=0$. This would mean $q=(0,0)$, which contradicts our assumption that $q \\neq (0,0)$. Therefore, for any point $q\\in S\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, its $y$-coordinate must be non-zero.\nThis implies that for any $q=(x,y) \\in S\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, the differential $d f_{q}$, represented by the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} -3x^{2} & 2y \\end{pmatrix}$, is not the zero matrix because its second component $2y$ is non-zero. The rank of $d f_{q}$ is therefore $1$.\nThis means that $f$ is a submersion at every point of the set $S\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$. The regular level set theorem (or more directly, the implicit function theorem) then guarantees that $S\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ is a smooth $1$-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nFinally, we need to produce a smooth local parametrization of $f^{-1}(0)$ near the singular point $(0,0)$ that captures its geometry. The defining equation for the level set is $y^{2}=x^{3}$. To parametrize this curve, we need to express $x$ and $y$ as smooth functions of a single parameter, say $t$. The powers suggest a substitution of the form $x=t^{m}$ and $y=t^{k}$. Substituting into the equation gives $(t^{k})^{2}=(t^{m})^{3}$, which simplifies to $t^{2k}=t^{3m}$. This identity holds if $2k=3m$. The simplest non-trivial integer solution is $m=2$ and $k=3$.\n\nThis suggests the parametrization $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by:\n$$\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t)) = (t^{2}, t^{3})$$\nLet's verify this parametrization. First, every point on the trace of $\\gamma$ lies on the level set:\n$$f(\\gamma(t)) = f(t^{2}, t^{3}) = (t^{3})^{2} - (t^{2})^{3} = t^{6} - t^{6} = 0$$\nThe components $x(t)=t^{2}$ and $y(t)=t^{3}$ are polynomials in $t$, so the map $\\gamma(t)$ is smooth. The singular point $(0,0)$ corresponds to the parameter value $t=0$, since $\\gamma(0)=(0^{2},0^{3})=(0,0)$. This parametrization is defined for all $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and therefore serves as a local parametrization for any neighborhood of $t=0$.\n\nThis parametrization reveals the nature of the singularity. The tangent vector to the curve is given by the derivative $\\gamma'(t) = (2t, 3t^{2})$. At the singular point $t=0$, the tangent vector is $\\gamma'(0)=(0,0)$. The vanishing of the tangent vector at the point of interest is characteristic of a cusp. The map $\\gamma$ is a smooth map from the line $\\mathbb{R}$ to the curve $S$, but it is not an immersion at $t=0$, which is the precise reason why $S$ fails to be a smooth submanifold at the origin. The parametrization $\\gamma(t)=(t^{2}, t^{3})$ provides a complete description of the local geometric structure of the singularity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} t^{2} & t^{3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3050978"}]}
