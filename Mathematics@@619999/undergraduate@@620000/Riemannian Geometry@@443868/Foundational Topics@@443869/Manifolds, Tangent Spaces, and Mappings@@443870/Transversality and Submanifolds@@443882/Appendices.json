The differential $dF_{p}:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ at a point $p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the derivative of $F$ at $p$, which for a smooth function between Euclidean spaces can be identified with the linearization given by the directional derivative:\n$$\ndF_{p}(v)=\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}F(p+tv).\n$$\nWith the Euclidean metric, the Riemannian gradient $\\nabla F$ is defined by\n$$\n\\langle \\nabla F(p),v\\rangle=dF_{p}(v)\n$$\nfor all $v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, where $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$ is the Euclidean inner product.\n\nStep 1: Regularity of $c=1$.

According to the Regular Value Theorem, $S=f^{-1}(0)$ is a 1-dimensional submanifold if $0$ is a regular value of $f$. A value is regular if the differential $df_p$ is surjective for all points $p$ in its preimage. For a map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, this means $df_p$ is not the zero map.\n\nThe differential of $f$ is represented by the matrix of partial derivatives:\n$$\ndf_{(x,y)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2x & 2y \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis differential has rank 0 (is the zero map) if and only if both components are zero, which occurs only at the point $p=(0,0)$.

Therefore, the Regular Value Theorem does not apply at this point, and $S$ fails to be a 1-dimensional submanifold at the origin. Geometrically, $S$ is the union of the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$, which form a cross at the origin. Any neighborhood of the origin in $S$ is not homeomorphic to an open interval of $\\mathbb{R}^1$. The failure of transversality is that for the map $f:\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, it is not transverse to the point $\\{0\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ at the origin, because the image of its differential, $\\text{Im}(df_{(0,0)}) = \\{0\\}$, does not span the tangent space $T_0\\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo compute the tangent cone $C_{(0,0)}S$, we consider the limiting directions of secants.

Any sequence of points in $S$ approaching the origin must eventually lie on these lines. The limiting directions of secants from points on $L_1$ will span $L_1$, and similarly for $L_2$.
