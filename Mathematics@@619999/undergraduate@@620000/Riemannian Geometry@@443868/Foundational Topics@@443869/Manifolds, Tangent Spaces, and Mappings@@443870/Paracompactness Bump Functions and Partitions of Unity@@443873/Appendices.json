I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the construction of a function $\\chi\\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ with specific properties, followed by an estimation of its gradient's uniform norm. The construction is prescribed as $\\chi := f*\\rho_{\\varepsilon}$, where $f$ is a specific Lipschitz cutoff function and $\\rho_{\\varepsilon}$ is a scaled standard mollifier.\n\nLet's break down the solution into the required parts.\n\n### Part 1: Construction of the Lipschitz function $f$\n\nWe are given that $f(x) = \\psi(|x|)$, where $\\psi: [0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a function satisfying:\n1.  $\\psi(r) = 1$ for $r \\in [0, 1+\\varepsilon]$\n2.  $\\psi(r) = 0$ for $r \\geq 2-\\varepsilon$\n3.  $\\psi$ is monotonic on the interval $[1+\\varepsilon, 2-\\varepsilon]$.\n\nWe require $f$ to be Lipschitz. This is guaranteed if $\\psi$ is Lipschitz. The simplest choice for $\\psi$ that satisfies these conditions is a function that transitions linearly from $1$ to $0$ on the interval $[1+\\varepsilon, 2-\\varepsilon]$.\n\nLet's define this piecewise linear function $\\psi(r)$:\n$$\n\\psi(r) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq r \\leq 1+\\varepsilon \\\\\n\\frac{(2-\\varepsilon) - r}{(2-\\varepsilon) - (1+\\varepsilon)} & \\text{if } 1+\\varepsilon < r < 2-\\varepsilon \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } r \\geq 2-\\varepsilon\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe linear part simplifies to $\\psi(r) = \\frac{2-\\varepsilon-r}{1-2\\varepsilon}$ for $r \\in (1+\\varepsilon, 2-\\varepsilon)$.\nThis function $\\psi$ is continuous and its derivative, where it exists, is:\n$$\n\\psi'(r) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq r < 1+\\varepsilon \\text{ or } r > 2-\\varepsilon \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{1-2\\varepsilon} & \\text{if } 1+\\varepsilon < r < 2-\\varepsilon\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe derivative is bounded, so $\\psi$ is a Lipschitz continuous function. The function $f(x) = \\psi(|x|)$ is then also Lipschitz continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The support of $f$ is contained in the closed ball $\\overline{B_{2-\\varepsilon}(0)}$, as $f(x)=0$ for $|x| \\geq 2-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Part 2: Properties of $\\chi = f * \\rho_{\\varepsilon}$\n\nNow we prove the stated properties of $\\chi(x) = (f * \\rho_{\\varepsilon})(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x-y) \\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y) dy$.\n\n1.  **$\\chi \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi) \\subset B_{2}(0)$:**\n    The function $f$ is continuous with compact support, so it is in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. The function $\\rho_{\\varepsilon}$ is in $C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ by definition. A standard result of convolution theory states that the convolution of an $L^1$ function with a $C^\\infty_c$ function is a $C^\\infty$ function. Thus, $\\chi$ is a smooth function.\n\n    To determine the support of $\\chi$, we use the property $\\operatorname{supp}(g*h) \\subset \\overline{\\operatorname{supp}(g) + \\operatorname{supp}(h)}$.\n    -   The support of $f$ is contained in $\\overline{B_{2-\\varepsilon}(0)}$.\n    -   The support of $\\rho_{\\varepsilon}$ is derived from the support of $\\rho$. Given $\\operatorname{supp}(\\rho) \\subset B_1(0)$, if $y \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\rho_\\varepsilon)$, then $y/\\varepsilon \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\rho)$, which implies $|y/\\varepsilon|<1$, so $|y|<\\varepsilon$. Thus, $\\operatorname{supp}(\\rho_{\\varepsilon}) \\subset B_{\\varepsilon}(0)$.\n\n    Let's find the set where $\\chi(x)$ can be non-zero.\n    $\\chi(x) \\neq 0$ only if there exists a $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(x-y) \\neq 0$ and $\\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y) \\neq 0$. This implies:\n    -   $y \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\rho_{\\varepsilon}) \\implies |y| < \\varepsilon$.\n    -   $x-y \\in \\operatorname{supp}(f) \\implies |x-y| \\leq 2-\\varepsilon$.\n\n    Using the triangle inequality, we can bound $|x|$:\n    $$|x| = |(x-y) + y| \\leq |x-y| + |y| < (2-\\varepsilon) + \\varepsilon = 2$$\n    So, if $\\chi(x) \\neq 0$, then $|x| < 2$. This means that the set $\\{x \\mid \\chi(x) \\neq 0\\}$ is a subset of the open ball $B_2(0)$. The support of $\\chi$, being the closure of this set, must be contained in the closure of $B_2(0)$, i.e., $\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi) \\subset \\overline{B_2(0)}$.\n\n    Moreover, if $|x| \\ge 2$, then for any $y$ with $|y|<\\varepsilon$, we have $|x-y| \\ge |x|-|y| > 2-\\varepsilon$.\n    Since $f(z)=0$ for $|z|\\ge 2-\\varepsilon$, it follows that $f(x-y)=0$ for all $y$ in the support of $\\rho_\\varepsilon$.\n    Therefore, $\\chi(x) = \\int f(x-y)\\rho_\\varepsilon(y)dy = 0$ for all $|x| \\ge 2$.\n    This shows that the support of $\\chi$ is a compact set contained within the open ball $B_2(0)$. Thus, $\\chi \\in C_c^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi) \\subset B_2(0)$.\n\n2.  **$\\chi \\equiv 1$ on $B_1(0)$:**\n    Let $x \\in B_1(0)$, so $|x|<1$. We analyze the value of $\\chi(x)$:\n    $$\\chi(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x-y) \\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y) dy$$\n    The integral is non-zero only for $y \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\rho_{\\varepsilon})$, which means $|y| < \\varepsilon$. For such $y$, we evaluate the argument of $f$:\n    $$|x-y| \\leq |x| + |y| < 1 + \\varepsilon$$\n    By our construction of $f(z) = \\psi(|z|)$, we have $f(z) = 1$ for $|z| \\leq 1+\\varepsilon$. Since $|x-y| < 1+\\varepsilon$, it follows that $f(x-y)=1$ for all $y$ contributing to the integral.\n    So, for $x \\in B_1(0)$, the expression for $\\chi(x)$ becomes:\n    $$\\chi(x) = \\int_{\\operatorname{supp}(\\rho_{\\varepsilon})} (1) \\cdot \\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y) dy = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y) dy$$\n    The total integral of a scaled mollifier is $1$:\n    $$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y) dy = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\varepsilon^{-n} \\rho(y/\\varepsilon) dy $$\n    Using the change of variables $u=y/\\varepsilon$, we have $y=\\varepsilon u$ and $dy = \\varepsilon^n du$. The integral becomes:\n    $$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\varepsilon^{-n} \\rho(u) \\varepsilon^n du = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\rho(u) du = 1 $$\n    Thus, for any $x \\in B_1(0)$, $\\chi(x)=1$.\n\n### Part 3: Estimation of $\\|\\nabla\\chi\\|_{\\infty}$\n\nWe need to find an upper bound for the uniform norm of the gradient of $\\chi$. A key property of convolution is that differentiation can be passed to either function, i.e., $\\nabla(g*h) = (\\nabla g)*h = g*(\\nabla h)$, under appropriate conditions. Since $f$ is Lipschitz but not necessarily $C^1$, its derivative $\\nabla f$ exists as a weak derivative in $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. The relation $\\nabla \\chi = (\\nabla f) * \\rho_{\\varepsilon}$ holds in the sense of distributions, and since $\\rho_\\varepsilon$ is smooth, the result is a smooth function.\n\nWe can apply Young's inequality for convolutions, which states $\\|g*h\\|_p \\leq \\|g\\|_q \\|h\\|_r$ for $1/p = 1/q + 1/r - 1$. We are interested in $\\|\\nabla\\chi\\|_\\infty$, so we set $p=\\infty$. A valid choice for the exponents is $q=\\infty$ and $r=1$.\n$$ \\|\\nabla\\chi\\|_{\\infty} = \\|(\\nabla f) * \\rho_{\\varepsilon}\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\|\\nabla f\\|_{\\infty} \\|\\rho_{\\varepsilon}\\|_{1} $$\nLet's compute the two norms on the right side.\n-   $\\|\\rho_{\\varepsilon}\\|_1 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |\\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y)| dy$. Since $\\rho \\ge 0$, $\\rho_{\\varepsilon} \\ge 0$, so this is $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\rho_{\\varepsilon}(y) dy = 1$.\n-   $\\|\\nabla f\\|_{\\infty}$ is the $L^\\infty$-norm of the weak derivative of $f(x)=\\psi(|x|)$. The weak derivative coincides with the classical derivative $\\nabla f(x) = \\psi'(|x|) \\frac{x}{|x|}$ almost everywhere. Its magnitude is $|\\nabla f(x)| = |\\psi'(|x|)|$. Therefore, $\\|\\nabla f\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{r>0} |\\psi'(r)|$.\n    From our chosen linear $\\psi$, we found that $|\\psi'(r)|$ is either $0$ or $\\frac{1}{1-2\\varepsilon}$.\n    So, $\\|\\nabla f\\|_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{1-2\\varepsilon}$.\n\nSubstituting these norms into the inequality gives our estimate:\n$$ \\|\\nabla\\chi\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\frac{1}{1-2\\varepsilon} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{1-2\\varepsilon} $$\n\n### Part 4: Concrete Bound for $\\varepsilon=1/4$\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of this upper bound when $\\varepsilon = 1/4$. The condition $\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1/2)$ is satisfied.\nSubstituting $\\varepsilon = 1/4$ into our derived bound:\n$$ \\|\\nabla\\chi\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\frac{1}{1 - 2(\\frac{1}{4})} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 $$\nThe upper bound for the uniform norm of the gradient is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3061222"}, {"introduction": "With a single smooth bump function in hand, we can now assemble them to serve a geometric purpose.

We will address each required property in turn.\n\nThe manifold is the unit circle $S^1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|=1\\}$. The open cover is $\\{U_1, U_2\\}$, where $U_1=\\{z\\in S^1:\\operatorname{Re}(z)-1/2\\}$ and $U_2=\\{z\\in S^1:\\operatorname{Re}(z)1/2\\}$. The partition of unity functions are defined via $\\varphi_1(z)=\\chi(\\operatorname{Re}(z))$ and $\\varphi_2(z)=1-\\chi(\\operatorname{Re}(z))$, where $\\chi(r) = s(2r+1/2)$ and $s(t)=\\frac{\\beta(t)}{\\beta(t)+\\beta(1-t)}$, with $\\beta(t)$ being the standard one-sided bump function.\n\n1.  **Smoothness of $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$**\n\n    The function $\\beta: \\mathbb{R} \\to [0, \\infty)$ defined by $\\beta(t)=\\exp(-1/t)$ for $t0$ and $\\beta(t)=0$ for $t \\leq 0$ is a standard example of a smooth function, i.e., $\\beta \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$. Its smoothness at $t=0$ is a classic result from analysis, where it can be shown that all derivatives from the right exist and are equal to $0$.\n\n    The function $s(t) = \\frac{\\beta(t)}{\\beta(t)+\\beta(1-t)}$ is defined as a quotient of functions involving $\\beta$. The denominator $\\beta(t)+\\beta(1-t)$ is always positive. If $t \\in (0,1)$, both $\\beta(t)$ and $\\beta(1-t)$ are positive. If $t \\leq 0$, then $\\beta(t)=0$ and $1-t \\geq 1  0$, so $\\beta(1-t)0$. If $t \\geq 1$, then $1-t \\leq 0$, so $\\beta(1-t)=0$ and $\\beta(t)0$. Since the denominator is never zero and $\\beta$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ function, $s(t)$ is also in $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ by the rules of differentiation.\n\n    The function $\\chi(r) = s(2r+1/2)$ is a composition of the $C^{\\infty}$ function $s$ and the affine (and therefore $C^{\\infty}$) function $r \\mapsto 2r+1/2$. Thus, $\\chi \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n    The function $\\varphi_1(z) = \\chi(\\operatorname{Re}(z))$ is defined on the smooth manifold $S^1$. The real part function, $\\operatorname{Re}: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, is a smooth function. In local coordinates, for example using the angle $\\theta$ such that $z(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$, we have $\\operatorname{Re}(z(\\theta)) = \\cos(\\theta)$, which is a $C^{\\infty}$ function of $\\theta$. Since $\\varphi_1$ is the composition of the smooth function $\\chi$ and the smooth function $\\operatorname{Re}$, it is a smooth function on $S^1$, so $\\varphi_1 \\in C^{\\infty}(S^1)$.\n\n    Finally, $\\varphi_2(z) = 1 - \\varphi_1(z)$. This is the difference between a constant function (which is smooth) and the smooth function $\\varphi_1$. Therefore, $\\varphi_2 \\in C^{\\infty}(S^1)$.\n\n2.  **Range of the functions ($0\\leq \\varphi_i\\leq 1$)**\n\n    By definition, $\\beta(t) \\geq 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For the function $s(t) = \\frac{\\beta(t)}{\\beta(t)+\\beta(1-t)}$, the numerator and denominator are both non-negative. It is clear that $s(t) \\geq 0$. Also, since $\\beta(1-t) \\geq 0$, we have $\\beta(t) \\leq \\beta(t) + \\beta(1-t)$, which implies $s(t) \\leq 1$. Thus, the range of $s(t)$ is contained in $[0,1]$.\n    \n    Since $\\chi(r) = s(2r+1/2)$, its range is also contained in $[0,1]$. Consequently, for any $z \\in S^1$, $\\varphi_1(z) = \\chi(\\operatorname{Re}(z))$ must satisfy $0 \\leq \\varphi_1(z) \\leq 1$.\n    \n    For $\\varphi_2(z) = 1 - \\varphi_1(z)$, the inequality $0 \\leq \\varphi_1(z) \\leq 1$ directly implies $0 \\leq 1 - \\varphi_1(z) \\leq 1$, so $0 \\leq \\varphi_2(z) \\leq 1$.\n\n3.  **Support conditions ($\\operatorname{supp}\\varphi_1 \\subset U_1$ and $\\operatorname{supp}\\varphi_2 \\subset U_2$)**\n\n    The support of a function is the closure of the set on which the function is non-zero.\n    \n    For $\\varphi_1$: $\\varphi_1(z) = s(2\\operatorname{Re}(z)+1/2)$.

If $z \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\varphi_1$, then $\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\geq -1/4$. Since $-1/4  -1/2$, it follows that $\\operatorname{Re}(z)  -1/2$, which means $z \\in U_1$. Thus, $\\operatorname{supp}\\varphi_1 \\subset U_1$.\n\n    For $\\varphi_2$: $\\varphi_2(z) = 1 - \\varphi_1(z)$. We know $s(t)=1$ if and only if $t \\geq 1$. So $\\varphi_1(z)=1$ if and only if $2\\operatorname{Re}(z)+1/2 \\geq 1$, which simplifies to $\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\geq 1/4$.\n    This means $\\varphi_2(z)=0$ if and only if $\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\geq 1/4$.\n    The set where $\\varphi_2$ is non-zero is $\\{z \\in S^1 : \\varphi_2(z)  0\\} = \\{z \\in S^1 : \\operatorname{Re}(z)  1/4\\}$.\n    The support of $\\varphi_2$ is the closure of this set: $\\operatorname{supp}\\varphi_2 = \\overline{\\{z \\in S^1 : \\operatorname{Re}(z)  1/4\\}} = \\{z \\in S^1 : \\operatorname{Re}(z) \\leq 1/4\\}$.\n    We must check if this is a subset of $U_2 = \\{z \\in S^1 : \\operatorname{Re}(z)  1/2\\}$. If $z \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\varphi_2$, then $\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\leq 1/4$. Since $1/4  1/2$, it follows that $\\operatorname{Re}(z)  1/2$, which means $z \\in U_2$. Thus, $\\operatorname{supp}\\varphi_2 \\subset U_2$.\n\n4.  **Summation property ($\\varphi_1+\\varphi_2\\equiv 1$)**\n\n    The definition of $\\varphi_2$ is $\\varphi_2(z) = 1 - \\varphi_1(z)$. Therefore, for any $z \\in S^1$, we have\n    $$ \\varphi_1(z) + \\varphi_2(z) = \\varphi_1(z) + (1 - \\varphi_1(z)) = 1. $$\n    This holds for all $z \\in S^1$, so $\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2 \\equiv 1$.\n    With properties 1-4 established, we have proven that $\\{\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2\\}$ is a partition of unity subordinate to the cover $\\{U_1, U_2\\}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluation of $\\varphi_1(i)$**\n\n    We are asked to compute the value of $\\varphi_1(z)$ at the point $z=i$. The real part of $i$ is $\\operatorname{Re}(i) = 0$.\n    Following the definitions:\n    $$ \\varphi_1(i) = \\chi(\\operatorname{Re}(i)) = \\chi(0). $$\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\chi(r)$:\n    $$ \\chi(0) = s(2(0)+1/2) = s(1/2). $$\n    Finally, we use the definition of $s(t)$:\n    $$ s(1/2) = \\frac{\\beta(1/2)}{\\beta(1/2) + \\beta(1-1/2)} = \\frac{\\beta(1/2)}{\\beta(1/2) + \\beta(1/2)} = \\frac{\\beta(1/2)}{2\\beta(1/2)}. $$\n    Since $1/2  0$, the function $\\beta(1/2) = \\exp(-1/(1/2)) = \\exp(-2)$ is a positive real number.

Provide the explicit $\\delta$-dependent factor as a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical rounding is required, and no units are involved.", "solution": "The problem as stated is mathematically well-posed and scientifically grounded within the established framework of Riemannian geometry. It requests the construction of a smooth bump function and the analysis of its derivative bounds, a standard and fundamental task in geometric analysis. All provided terms and premises are valid. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe overall strategy is to first construct a suitable continuous, but not smooth, function using the Riemannian distance. This function will then be regularized (smoothed) using the principles described in the problem statement. Finally, this smooth function will be composed with the given cutoff profile $\\vartheta$ to yield the desired function $\\phi$. The bounds on the covariant derivatives of $\\phi$ will be derived using the chain rule and the known scaling properties of the regularization process.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the function $\\phi$**\n\nLet $h: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the Riemannian distance function from the compact set $K$, defined as $h(x) \\coloneqq d_g(x, K) = \\inf_{y \\in K} d_g(x, y)$. This function is continuous on $M$ and is $1$-Lipschitz, i.e., $|h(x_1) - h(x_2)| \\le d_g(x_1, x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in M$. However, $h$ is not smooth in general.\n\nTo obtain a smooth function, we must regularize $h$. The problem statement permits the use of mollification in local charts, tied together by a partition of unity. Let us denote the result of such a regularization process with a smoothing radius $\\varepsilon  0$ by $h_\\varepsilon$. This process yields a smooth function $h_\\varepsilon \\in C^\\infty(M)$ with the following standard properties, which are derived from the given premises:\n1.  **Uniform Approximation:** There exists a constant $A_0$ (independent of $h$ and $\\varepsilon$) such that for all $x \\in M$, $|h_\\varepsilon(x) - h(x)| \\le A_0 \\varepsilon$. By appropriate normalization of the mollifier, we can ensure $A_0=1$, so $|h_\\varepsilon(x) - h(x)| \\le \\varepsilon$.\n2.  **Derivative Bounds:** For each integer $p \\ge 1$, there exists a constant $B_p  0$ such that the norm of the $p$-th covariant derivative is bounded by $|\\nabla^p h_\\varepsilon|_g \\le B_p \\varepsilon^{-(p-1)}$. These constants $B_p$ depend on the choice of mollifier and on uniform bounds for the metric and its derivatives (i.e., Christoffel symbols and their derivatives) over the compact set $\\overline{V}$, but they are independent of $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$. For $p=1$, the bound is $|\\nabla h_\\varepsilon|_g \\le B_1$, which can be shown to be at most the Lipschitz constant of $h$, so $B_1 \\le 1$.\n\nWe are given the fixed, nonincreasing profile $\\vartheta \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$ with $\\vartheta(t) = 1$ for $t \\le \\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\vartheta(t) = 0$ for $t \\ge \\frac{2}{3}$. We are also given $\\delta = d_g(K, M \\setminus U)  0$. We construct the function $\\phi$ by choosing an appropriate smoothing radius $\\varepsilon$ that depends on $\\delta$. Let us set the smoothing radius to be $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\delta}{3}$.\n\nNow, define the function $\\phi \\in C^\\infty(M)$ as follows:\n$$\n\\phi(x) \\coloneqq \\vartheta\\left( \\frac{h_{\\delta/3}(x)}{\\delta} \\right).\n$$\nThis function is smooth as it is a composition of smooth functions. We verify its properties:\n\n1.  **Value on $K$:** For any $x \\in K$, we have $h(x) = d_g(x, K) = 0$. By the approximation property of the regularization, $|h_{\\delta/3}(x) - h(x)| = |h_{\\delta/3}(x)| \\le \\frac{\\delta}{3}$. Since $h$ is non-negative, the regularization can be constructed such that $h_{\\delta/3}$ is also non-negative. Thus, $0 \\le h_{\\delta/3}(x) \\le \\frac{\\delta}{3}$. The argument of $\\vartheta$ is $\\frac{h_{\\delta/3}(x)}{\\delta}$, which satisfies $0 \\le \\frac{h_{\\delta/3}(x)}{\\delta} \\le \\frac{1}{3}$. By the definition of $\\vartheta$, this implies $\\phi(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in K$.\n\n2.  **Support:** The support of $\\phi$, denoted $\\operatorname{supp}(\\phi)$, is the closure of the set $\\{x \\in M \\mid \\phi(x) \\neq 0\\}$. The function $\\phi(x)$ can be non-zero only if the argument of $\\vartheta$ is less than $\\frac{2}{3}$. This means $\\frac{h_{\\delta/3}(x)}{\\delta}  \\frac{2}{3}$, or $h_{\\delta/3}(x)  \\frac{2\\delta}{3}$.\n    Using the approximation property again, if $h_{\\delta/3}(x)  \\frac{2\\delta}{3}$, then $h(x) \\le h_{\\delta/3}(x) + \\frac{\\delta}{3}  \\frac{2\\delta}{3} + \\frac{\\delta}{3} = \\delta$.\n    So, $\\operatorname{supp}(\\phi) \\subseteq \\{x \\in M \\mid h(x) \\le \\delta\\} = \\{x \\in M \\mid d_g(x, K) \\le \\delta\\}$.\n    By the definition of $\\delta = \\inf\\{ d_g(x,y) : x \\in K,\\ y \\in M\\setminus U \\}$, any point $z$ with $d_g(z, K)  \\delta$ must lie in $U$. The boundary case $d_g(z, K) = \\delta$ could potentially lie in $M \\setminus U$. However, our condition for the support is $h(x) \\le \\frac{2\\delta}{3} + \\frac{\\delta}{3} = \\delta$, coming from a strict inequality, so we have $h(x)  \\delta$ for points where $\\phi$ is possibly non-zero. Thus, $\\{x \\mid \\phi(x) \\ne 0\\} \\subset \\{x \\mid h(x)  \\delta\\} \\subset U$.\n    Since $\\operatorname{supp}(\\phi)$ is the closure of this set and $U \\Subset V$ (meaning $\\overline{U}$ is compact and $\\overline{U} \\subset V$), it follows that $\\operatorname{supp}(\\phi) \\subseteq \\overline{U} \\subset V$. As $\\overline{U}$ is compact, $\\operatorname{supp}(\\phi)$ is also compact. Thus, $\\phi \\in C^\\infty_c(V)$.\n\n**Part 2: Bounds on Covariant Derivatives**\n\nWe now derive the bounds for $|\\nabla^k \\phi|_g$. Let $F(x) \\coloneqq \\frac{h_{\\delta/3}(x)}{\\delta}$. Then $\\phi(x) = \\vartheta(F(x))$. The $k$-th covariant derivative of $\\phi$ can be computed using the general chain rule (Faà di Bruno's formula), which expresses $\\nabla^k \\phi$ as a sum of terms involving the derivatives of $\\vartheta$ and the covariant derivatives of $F$. The crucial step is to determine the scaling of $|\\nabla^p F|_g$ with respect to $\\delta$.\n\nFor any integer $p \\ge 1$, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla^p F(x) = \\nabla^p \\left( \\frac{h_{\\delta/3}(x)}{\\delta} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\nabla^p h_{\\delta/3}(x).\n$$\nUsing the assumed bound on the derivatives of the regularized function with $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\delta}{3}$, we find:\n$$\n|\\nabla^p F(x)|_g = \\frac{1}{\\delta} |\\nabla^p h_{\\delta/3}(x)|_g \\le \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\left( B_p \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{3}\\right)^{-(p-1)} \\right) = \\frac{B_p}{\\delta} \\frac{3^{p-1}}{\\delta^{-(p-1)}} = (B_p 3^{p-1}) \\delta^{-p}.\n$$\nLet $C'_p = B_p 3^{p-1}$. This constant depends on $p$, the manifold's geometry on $\\overline{V}$, and the mollifier, but not on $\\delta$. Thus, $|\\nabla^p F|_g \\le C'_p \\delta^{-p}$.\n\nThe general formula for $\\nabla^k (\\vartheta \\circ F)$ is a sum of multi-linear terms. Each term schematically looks like $\\vartheta^{(m)}(F) \\cdot \\text{TensorProduct}(\\nabla^{p_1} F, \\dots, \\nabla^{p_m} F)$, where the sum of the orders of differentiation is $k$. The norm of such a term is bounded by a constant times $\\sup|\\vartheta^{(m)}| \\cdot \\prod_{j=1}^m |\\nabla^{p_j} F|_g$.\n\nThe $\\delta$-dependence of this term's bound is given by the product of the $\\delta$-dependencies of each factor:\n$$\n\\prod_{j=1}^m (\\text{factor for } |\\nabla^{p_j} F|_g) = \\prod_{j=1}^m \\delta^{-p_j} = \\delta^{-\\sum_{j=1}^m p_j}.\n$$\nDue to the structure of the Faà di Bruno formula, the sum of the orders of the derivatives in each term is always $k$. Therefore, every term in the expansion of $\\nabla^k \\phi$ has a norm whose $\\delta$-scaling is $\\delta^{-k}$.\n\nFor example, consider two illustrative terms in the expansion:\n1.  The term involving $\\nabla^k F$: This is $(\\vartheta' \\circ F) \\nabla^k F$. Its norm is bounded by $\\sup|\\vartheta'| |\\nabla^k F|_g \\le \\sup|\\vartheta'| C'_k \\delta^{-k}$.\n2.  The term involving only first derivatives of $F$: This is $(\\vartheta^{(k)} \\circ F) (\\nabla F)^{\\otimes k}$. Its norm is bounded by $\\sup|\\vartheta^{(k)}| |\\nabla F|_g^k \\le \\sup|\\vartheta^{(k)}| (C'_1 \\delta^{-1})^k = (\\sup|\\vartheta^{(k)}| (C'_1)^k) \\delta^{-k}$.\n\nSince every term contributing to $\\nabla^k\\phi$ has its norm bounded by a constant times $\\delta^{-k}$, their sum, $|\\nabla^k\\phi|_g$, is also bounded by a constant times $\\delta^{-k}$.\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in M} |\\nabla^{k}\\phi(x)|_g \\le C_{k} \\delta^{-k}.\n$$\nThe constant $C_k$ incorporates the bounds on the derivatives of $\\vartheta$, the regularization constants $B_p$, combinatorial factors from the chain rule, and geometric bounds from the manifold, none of which depend on $\\delta$.\n\nThe explicit $\\delta$-dependent factor governing this bound is therefore $\\delta^{-k}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\delta^{-k}}$$", "id": "3061236"}]}
