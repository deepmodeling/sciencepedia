No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires us to construct and validate a specific two-chart atlas for the unit circle $S^{1}$, derive the corresponding transition map, and prove its smoothness from first principles.\n\nFirst, we validate that the provided charts, $(\\varphi_{1}, U_{1})$ and $(\\varphi_{2}, U_{2})$, form a valid atlas for $S^{1}$. An atlas is a collection of charts $\\{(U_{\\alpha}, \\varphi_{\\alpha})\\}$ such that the domains $\\{U_{\\alpha}\\}$ cover the entire manifold.\n\nThe domains of the two charts are $U_{1} = S^{1} \\setminus \\{N\\}$ and $U_{2} = S^{1} \\setminus \\{W\\}$, where $N = (0,1)$ and $W = (-1,0)$. The union of these domains is:\n$$U_{1} \\cup U_{2} = (S^{1} \\setminus \\{N\\}) \\cup (S^{1} \\setminus \\{W\\}) = S^{1} \\setminus (\\{N\\} \\cap \\{W\\})$$\nSince $N \\neq W$, their intersection is the empty set, $\\{N\\} \\cap \\{W\\} = \\emptyset$. Therefore, $U_{1} \\cup U_{2} = S^{1}$, and the domains cover the manifold.\n\nNext, we must verify that each map $\\varphi_{i}: U_{i} \\to V_{i}$ is a homeomorphism from an open subset $U_{i}$ of $S^{1}$ to an open subset $V_{i}$ of $\\mathbb{R}$. In the subspace topology of $S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, single points are closed sets. Thus, their complements, $U_{1} = S^{1} \\setminus \\{N\\}$ and $U_{2} = S^{1} \\setminus \\{W\\}$, are open sets in $S^{1}$. The target spaces are $V_{1} = \\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ and $V_{2} = (-\\pi, \\pi)$, which are open intervals and thus open sets in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe maps are defined by assigning a unique angle $\\theta$ to each point $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$.\nFor $\\varphi_{1}$, the range $\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ covers the circle exactly once, excluding the angle $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which corresponds to the point $N=(0,1)$. This makes the map a bijection from $U_{1}$ to $V_{1}$. The inverse map $\\varphi_{1}^{-1}: \\theta \\mapsto (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ is continuous because its component functions, $\\cos$ and $\\sin$, are continuous. The map $\\varphi_{1}$ itself, being a specific branch of the multi-valued `arctan2` function, is continuous on its domain $U_{1}$. Thus, $\\varphi_{1}$ is a homeomorphism.\nSimilarly, for $\\varphi_{2}$, the range $(-\\pi, \\pi)$ covers the circle exactly once, excluding the angle $\\theta=\\pi$ (or $\\theta=-\\pi$), which corresponds to the point $W=(-1,0)$. The map $\\varphi_{2}$ is a bijection from $U_{2}$ to $V_{2}$. By the same reasoning, $\\varphi_{2}$ and its inverse are continuous, so $\\varphi_{2}$ is also a homeomorphism.\nSince the domains cover $S^1$ and each chart is a homeomorphism, the pair $\\{(\\varphi_{1}, U_{1}), (\\varphi_{2}, U_{2})\\}$ constitutes a valid atlas for $S^{1}$.\n\nNow, we derive the transition map $\\tau = \\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{2}^{-1}$. The domain of $\\tau$ is the image of the intersection of the chart domains under $\\varphi_{2}$, which is $\\varphi_{2}(U_{1} \\cap U_{2})$.\nThe intersection is $U_{1} \\cap U_{2} = S^{1} \\setminus \\{N, W\\}$.\nTo find the domain of $\\tau$, we map this set to $\\mathbb{R}$ using $\\varphi_{2}$. The domain of $\\varphi_{2}$ is $U_{2} = S^1 \\setminus \\{W\\}$, and its image is $V_{2} = (-\\pi, \\pi)$. The set $U_{1} \\cap U_{2}$ is simply $U_{2} \\setminus \\{N\\}$. The point $N=(0,1)$ is represented by $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ for $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The unique value in the range of $\\varphi_{2}$, $(-\\pi, \\pi)$, is $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThus, the domain of the transition map is $\\varphi_{2}(U_{2} \\setminus \\{N\\}) = \\varphi_{2}(U_{2}) \\setminus \\{\\varphi_{2}(N)\\} = (-\\pi, \\pi) \\setminus \\{\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\}$. This domain is the union of two disjoint open intervals: $(-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$.\n\nLet $\\theta_{2}$ be a value in this domain. The transition map is computed as $\\tau(\\theta_{2}) = \\varphi_{1}(\\varphi_{2}^{-1}(\\theta_{2}))$.\nStep 1: Apply $\\varphi_{2}^{-1}$. This maps the angle coordinate $\\theta_2$ to a point on the circle: $p = \\varphi_{2}^{-1}(\\theta_2) = (\\cos \\theta_{2}, \\sin \\theta_{2})$.\nStep 2: Apply $\\varphi_{1}$. This maps the point $p$ to its angle coordinate $\\theta_1$ which must lie in the interval $V_{1} = \\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nSo, we need to find $\\theta_1 \\in \\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ such that $(\\cos \\theta_{1}, \\sin \\theta_{1}) = (\\cos \\theta_{2}, \\sin \\theta_{2})$. This implies that $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. We must choose $k$ such that $\\theta_1$ falls into the correct range. We analyze this based on the domain of $\\theta_2$.\n\nCase 1: $\\theta_{2} \\in (-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nIn this case, the value $\\theta_2$ is already within the target interval for $\\varphi_1$, since $(-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\subset \\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. Thus, we can choose $k=0$, which gives $\\theta_{1} = \\theta_{2}$.\nSo, for $\\theta_{2} \\in (-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we have $\\tau(\\theta_2) = \\theta_2$.\n\nCase 2: $\\theta_{2} \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$.\nIn this case, $\\theta_2$ does not lie in the target interval $\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. We must find an integer $k$ such that $\\theta_{1} = \\theta_2 + 2k\\pi \\in \\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nIf $k=0$, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$, which is not in the target range.\nIf $k=1$, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 + 2\\pi > \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{2}$, which is too large.\nIf $k=-1$, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 - 2\\pi$. Since $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\theta_2 < \\pi$, we have $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2\\pi < \\theta_2 - 2\\pi < \\pi - 2\\pi$, which simplifies to $-\\frac{3\\pi}{2} < \\theta_1 < -\\pi$. This interval is a subinterval of $\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nThus, for $\\theta_2 \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$, we must choose $k=-1$, which gives $\\tau(\\theta_2) = \\theta_2 - 2\\pi$.\n\nCombining these cases and using $\\theta$ as the independent variable, the transition map $\\tau$ is given by the piecewise expression:\n$$ \\tau(\\theta) = \\begin{cases} \\theta & \\text{if } \\theta \\in (-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\\\ \\theta - 2\\pi & \\text{if } \\theta \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi) \\end{cases} $$\n\nFinally, we prove that this transition map is smooth on its domain. A function is smooth on an open set if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) at every point in that set.\nThe domain of $\\tau$ is the union of two disjoint open intervals: $(-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ and $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$.\nOn the interval $(-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $\\tau(\\theta) = \\theta$. This is a linear function. Its first derivative is $\\tau'(\\theta) = 1$. All higher-order derivatives are $\\tau^{(k)}(\\theta) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$. Since all derivatives exist and are continuous, $\\tau$ is smooth on this interval.\nOn the interval $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$, $\\tau(\\theta) = \\theta - 2\\pi$. This is also a linear function. Its first derivative is $\\tau'(\\theta) = 1$. All higher-order derivatives are $\\tau^{(k)}(\\theta) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$. Again, all derivatives exist and are continuous, so $\\tau$ is smooth on this interval.\nSince the function $\\tau$ is smooth on each of the open intervals that constitute its domain, it is smooth on its entire domain $\\varphi_{2}(U_{1} \\cap U_{2})$. This confirms that the charts $\\varphi_{1}$ and $\\varphi_{2}$ are smoothly compatible, and thus $\\{(\\varphi_{1}, U_{1}), (\\varphi_{2}, U_{2})\\}$ is a smooth atlas for $S^{1}$.\nThe problem only asks for the final expression for the transition map.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\tau(\\theta) = \\begin{cases} \\theta & \\text{for } \\theta \\in (-\\pi, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\\\ \\theta - 2\\pi & \\text{for } \\theta \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi) \\end{cases}\n}\n$$", "id": "3079317"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand a definition, it's essential to study cases where it doesn't apply.

The tasks are specific, interconnected, and lead to a unique set of solutions. The problem is self-contained. There is a minor ambiguity in Task 2 regarding the codomain of the chart maps, which is specified as $(-\\delta, \\delta)$, whereas the natural construction yields disjoint unions of open intervals or intervals like $(0, \\delta)$. However, this is likely a minor imprecision in the problem statement rather than a fatal flaw, as the core intent of constructing charts on different branches is clear and achievable. The problem is solvable under a reasonable interpretation.\n- **Objective:** Yes. The problem is stated using formal mathematical language, free from subjectivity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the five tasks in order.\n\n**1) Verification of Smooth Immersion**\n\nThe curve is defined by the map $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t)) = (\\sin t, \\sin 2t)$. The component functions $x(t) = \\sin t$ and $y(t) = \\sin 2t$ are infinitely differentiable (smooth) functions on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $\\gamma$ is a smooth map from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nFor $\\gamma$ to be a smooth immersion, its differential, represented by the derivative $\\gamma'(t)$, must have full rank for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The domain $\\mathbb{R}$ has dimension $1$, so full rank means the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$ must be non-zero for all $t$.\n\nThe tangent vector is:\n$$\n\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}, \\frac{dy}{dt}\\right) = (\\cos t, 2\\cos 2t)\n$$\nWe must show that this vector is never the zero vector $(0,0)$. We set the first component to zero:\n$$\n\\cos t = 0 \\implies t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi \\quad \\text{for any integer } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the second component at these values of $t$:\n$$\ny'(t) = 2\\cos(2t) = 2\\cos\\left(2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\\right)\\right) = 2\\cos(\\pi + 2k\\pi) = 2\\cos(\\pi) = -2\n$$\nSince the second component of $\\gamma'(t)$ is $-2$ whenever the first component is $0$, the vector $\\gamma'(t)$ can never be the zero vector $(0,0)$. Therefore, the differential of $\\gamma$ has rank $1$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $\\gamma$ is a smooth immersion.\n\n**2) Construction of Local Charts**\n\nThe problem asks for charts near the two branches meeting at $(0,0)$. The self-intersection at the origin $(0,0)$ occurs when $\\sin t = 0$ and $\\sin 2t=0$, which implies $t=k\\pi$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The two distinct tangent directions at the origin arise from $t=0$ (and its $2\\pi$ shifts) and $t=\\pi$ (and its $2\\pi$ shifts).\n\nThe relationship between the coordinates $x=\\sin t$ and $y=\\sin 2t$ is given by $y = \\sin 2t = 2\\sin t \\cos t = 2x \\cos t$. Since $\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1$, we have $\\cos t = \\pm\\sqrt{1-x^2}$.\nThe curve $X$ is the union of the graphs of two functions of $x$: $y = 2x\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $y = -2x\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ for $x \\in [-1,1]$.\n- The branch corresponding to $\\cos t > 0$ (i.e., $t \\in (-\\pi/2, \\pi/2) + 2k\\pi$) is the graph of $y = 2x\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. This branch passes through the origin at $t=0$.\n- The branch corresponding to $\\cos t < 0$ (i.e., $t \\in (\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2) + 2k\\pi$) is the graph of $y = -2x\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. This branch passes through the origin at $t=\\pi$.\n\nWe construct charts on parts of these two branches. Let $\\delta \\in (0,1)$. We define two open sets in $X \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nLet $U_+$ be the portion of the first branch where $x \\in (0, \\delta)$:\n$$\nU_+ = \\{(x,y) \\in X \\mid x \\in (0, \\delta) \\text{ and } y > 0\\} = \\{(x, 2x\\sqrt{1-x^2}) \\mid x \\in (0, \\delta)\\}\n$$\nAnd let $U_-$ be the portion of the second branch where $x \\in (0, \\delta)$:\n$$\nU_- = \\{(x,y) \\in X \\mid x \\in (0, \\delta) \\text{ and } y < 0\\} = \\{(x, -2x\\sqrt{1-x^2}) \\mid x \\in (0, \\delta)\\}\n$$\nThese are open sets in $X \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ because for any point in them, its $x$ coordinate is strictly positive, separating it from the parts of the curve with $x \\le 0$, and its $y$ coordinate has a definite sign, separating it from the other branch.\n\nThe coordinate maps are the projections onto the $x$-axis. Let's call them $\\psi_+$ and $\\psi_-$:\n$$\n\\psi_+: U_+ \\to (0, \\delta), \\quad \\psi_+(x,y) = x\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_-: U_- \\to (0, \\delta), \\quad \\psi_-(x,y) = x\n$$\nThese maps are homeomorphisms. Their inverses are given as graphs over the $x$-axis:\n$$\n\\psi_+^{-1}: (0, \\delta) \\to U_+, \\quad \\psi_+^{-1}(x) = (x, 2x\\sqrt{1-x^2})\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_-^{-1}: (0, \\delta) \\to U_-, \\quad \\psi_-^{-1}(x) = (x, -2x\\sqrt{1-x^2})\n$$\nNote: The problem statement requests the codomain of the charts to be $(-\\delta, \\delta)$. The natural charts constructed map to $(0, \\delta)$. To satisfy the problem's literal constraint, one could compose these with an affine map from $(0,\\delta)$ to $(-\\delta,\\delta)$, e.g., $L(x) = 2x-\\delta$. However, the construction above satisfies the spirit of the question by defining charts on the two different branches meeting at the origin and expressing them as graphs over the x-axis.\n\n**3) Transition Map and its Derivative**\n\nWe consider the upper-right branch near the origin, corresponding to small positive values of $t$. On this branch, $x = \\sin t > 0$ and $y = \\sin 2t > 0$.\n- The first chart, $\\phi_x$, projects to the $x$-axis: $u = \\phi_x(p) = x$.\n- The second chart, $\\phi_y$, projects to the $y$-axis: $v = \\phi_y(p) = y$.\n\nFor $t \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, both $x=\\sin t$ and $y=\\sin 2t$ are strictly increasing functions of $t$. By the Inverse Function Theorem, both projections define valid coordinate charts in a neighborhood of any point on this branch (excluding endpoints where derivatives might vanish, but near $t=0$ both are fine).\n\nThe transition map from the $x$-chart to the $y$-chart is the function $f = \\phi_y \\circ \\phi_x^{-1}$. This map takes a coordinate $u=x$ from the first chart and returns the corresponding coordinate $v=y$ in the second chart. We must express $y$ as a function of $x$ for this branch. As established, this is:\n$$\nf(x) = y = 2x\\sqrt{1-x^2}\n$$\nThis is the required transition map, as a single elementary expression.\n\nNext, we compute its derivative with respect to $x$ using the product and chain rules:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( 2x(1-x^2)^{1/2} \\right) = 2(1-x^2)^{1/2} + 2x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(1-x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x) = 2\\sqrt{1-x^2} - \\frac{2x^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\n$$\nWe evaluate this derivative at $x=0$:\n$$\nf'(0) = 2\\sqrt{1-0^2} - \\frac{2(0)^2}{\\sqrt{1-0^2}} = 2\\sqrt{1} - 0 = 2\n$$\nThe derivative of the transition map at $x=0$ is $2$. This corresponds to the slope $dy/dx$ at the origin for this branch.\n\n**4) Why $X$ is not a Manifold at $(0,0)$**\n\nA space is a $1$-dimensional topological manifold if it is Hausdorff, second-countable, and every point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. The space $X$ inherits the Hausdorff and second-countable properties from $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We must check the local Euclidean property at the origin $p_0 = (0,0)$.\n\nLet $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p_0$ in $X$. By the definition of the subspace topology, $U = V \\cap X$ for some open set $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ containing $p_0$. Since $V$ is open, it contains an open ball $B_\\epsilon(p_0)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. Thus, $U$ contains the set $B_\\epsilon(p_0) \\cap X$.\n\nThe set $B_\\epsilon(p_0) \\cap X$ consists of four distinct curvilinear arcs that meet only at $p_0$. Now consider the set $U \\setminus \\{p_0\\}$. This set contains $ (B_\\epsilon(p_0) \\cap X) \\setminus \\{p_0\\} $, which has four connected components (the four punctured arcs).\n\nIf $U$ were homeomorphic to an open interval $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, say via a homeomorphism $h: U \\to I$, then $h(p_0)$ would be a point in $I$. The set $U \\setminus \\{p_0\\}$ would be homeomorphic to $I \\setminus \\{h(p_0)\\}$. Removing a point from an open interval disconnects it into exactly two connected components.\n\nHowever, we have established that for any neighborhood $U$ of $p_0$, the set $U \\setminus \\{p_0\\}$ has at least four connected components. Since the number of connected components is a topological invariant, $U$ cannot be homeomorphic to an open interval.\nTherefore, $X$ is not a $1$-dimensional topological manifold at the point $(0,0)$.\n\n**5) Angle between Tangent Lines**\n\nThe self-intersection is at the origin, $(0,0)$. The values of the parameter $t$ for which $\\gamma(t)=(0,0)$ are $t=k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The curve repeats every $2\\pi$, so we have two distinct passages through the origin in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$: one at $t=0$ and one at $t=\\pi$.

The charts are defined by stereographic projections from the north pole, $N=(0,0,1)$, and the south pole, $S=(0,0,-1)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the explicit formula for the stereographic projection from the north pole, $\\varphi_{N}:\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\setminus\\{N\\}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. A point $P=(x,y,z)$ on $\\mathbb{S}^2$ (with $z \\neq 1$) is mapped to the point $(u,v)$ in the plane $\\{z=0\\}$. The line passing through $N=(0,0,1)$ and $P=(x,y,z)$ can be parameterized by $L(t) = N + t(P-N) = (0,0,1) + t(x,y,z-1) = (tx, ty, 1+t(z-1))$. The intersection with the plane $z=0$ occurs when $1+t(z-1)=0$, which yields $t = \\frac{1}{1-z}$. Substituting this value of $t$ back into the line equation gives the coordinates of the projected point:\n$$ (u,v,0) = \\left(\\frac{x}{1-z}, \\frac{y}{1-z}, 0\\right) $$\nThus, the chart map is $\\varphi_{N}(x,y,z) = (u,v) = \\left(\\frac{x}{1-z}, \\frac{y}{1-z}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we find the inverse map $\\varphi_{N}^{-1}:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\setminus\\{N\\}$. Given a point $(u,v)$ in the plane, we seek the corresponding point $(x,y,z)$ on the sphere. We have $x=u(1-z)$ and $y=v(1-z)$. Substituting these into the sphere equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$:\n$$ (u^2+v^2)(1-z)^2 + z^2 = 1 $$\nSince $x^2+y^2=1-z^2=(1-z)(1+z)$, we can write:\n$$ (u^2+v^2)(1-z)^2 = (1-z)(1+z) $$\nAs $z \\neq 1$, we can divide by $(1-z)$:\n$$ (u^2+v^2)(1-z) = 1+z $$\nSolving for $z$:\n$$ u^2+v^2 - z(u^2+v^2) = 1+z \\implies u^2+v^2-1 = z(1+u^2+v^2) \\implies z = \\frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1} $$\nTo find $x$ and $y$, we first compute $1-z$:\n$$ 1-z = 1 - \\frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1} = \\frac{(u^2+v^2+1)-(u^2+v^2-1)}{u^2+v^2+1} = \\frac{2}{u^2+v^2+1} $$\nNow we can find $x$ and $y$:\n$$ x = u(1-z) = \\frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1} $$\n$$ y = v(1-z) = \\frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1} $$\nSo the inverse map is $\\varphi_{N}^{-1}(u,v) = \\left(\\frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1}, \\frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1}, \\frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1}\\right)$.\n\nSimilarly, we derive the formula for the stereographic projection from the south pole, $\\varphi_{S}:\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\setminus\\{S\\}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The line through $S=(0,0,-1)$ and $P=(x,y,z)$ is $L(t) = S+t(P-S) = (tx, ty, -1+t(z+1))$. Setting the $z$-coordinate to $0$ gives $t=\\frac{1}{z+1}$ (for $z \\neq -1$). The projection is:\n$$ \\varphi_{S}(x,y,z) = \\left(\\frac{x}{1+z}, \\frac{y}{1+z}\\right) $$\n\nNow we can compute the transition map $\\psi=\\varphi_{S}\\circ\\varphi_{N}^{-1}$. The domain of $\\psi$ is the image under $\\varphi_N$ of the overlap of the chart domains, which is $\\mathbb{S}^2 \\setminus \\{N, S\\}$. The image of this set is $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, since $\\varphi_N(S) = (0,0)$. For $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, we compute:\n$$ (x,y,z) = \\varphi_{N}^{-1}(u,v) = \\left(\\frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1}, \\frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1}, \\frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1}\\right) $$\nAnd then apply $\\varphi_S$ to this point. We need $1+z$:\n$$ 1+z = 1 + \\frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1} = \\frac{(u^2+v^2+1)+(u^2+v^2-1)}{u^2+v^2+1} = \\frac{2(u^2+v^2)}{u^2+v^2+1} $$\nThe components of $\\psi(u,v)$, which we denote by $(u',v')$, are:\n$$ u' = \\frac{x}{1+z} = \\frac{\\frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1}}{\\frac{2(u^2+v^2)}{u^2+v^2+1}} = \\frac{u}{u^2+v^2} $$\n$$ v' = \\frac{y}{1+z} = \\frac{\\frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1}}{\\frac{2(u^2+v^2)}{u^2+v^2+1}} = \\frac{v}{u^2+v^2} $$\nSo the transition map is $\\psi(u,v) = \\left(\\frac{u}{u^2+v^2}, \\frac{v}{u^2+v^2}\\right)$. This is inversion in the unit circle.\n\nNext, we compute the Jacobian matrix $D\\psi(u,v)$. Let $\\psi_1(u,v) = \\frac{u}{u^2+v^2}$ and $\\psi_2(u,v) = \\frac{v}{u^2+v^2}$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\psi_1}{\\partial u} = \\frac{1(u^2+v^2) - u(2u)}{(u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{v^2-u^2}{(u^2+v^2)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\psi_1}{\\partial v} = \\frac{0 - u(2v)}{(u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{-2uv}{(u^2+v^2)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\psi_2}{\\partial u} = \\frac{0 - v(2u)}{(u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{-2uv}{(u^2+v^2)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\psi_2}{\\partial v} = \\frac{1(u^2+v^2) - v(2v)}{(u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{u^2-v^2}{(u^2+v^2)^2} $$\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ D\\psi(u,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{v^2-u^2}{(u^2+v^2)^2} & \\frac{-2uv}{(u^2+v^2)^2} \\\\ \\frac{-2uv}{(u^2+v^2)^2} & \\frac{u^2-v^2}{(u^2+v^2)^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$ \\det(D\\psi(u,v)) = \\frac{(v^2-u^2)(u^2-v^2) - (-2uv)(-2uv)}{((u^2+v^2)^2)^2} $$\n$$ = \\frac{-(u^2-v^2)^2 - 4u^2v^2}{(u^2+v^2)^4} = \\frac{-(u^4 - 2u^2v^2 + v^4) - 4u^2v^2}{(u^2+v^2)^4} $$\n$$ = \\frac{-u^4 - 2u^2v^2 - v^4}{(u^2+v^2)^4} = \\frac{-(u^2+v^2)^2}{(u^2+v^2)^4} = -\\frac{1}{(u^2+v^2)^2} $$\nOn the domain of $\\psi$, which is $\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, the term $u^2+v^2$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $(u^2+v^2)^2$ is also strictly positive. This implies that $\\det(D\\psi(u,v)) = -\\frac{1}{(u^2+v^2)^2}$ is strictly negative for all $(u,v)$ in the domain. This indicates that the transition map is orientation-reversing.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the determinant at the representative point $(u,v)=(1,0)$:\n$$ \\det(D\\psi(1,0)) = -\\frac{1}{(1^2+0^2)^2} = -\\frac{1}{1^2} = -1 $$\nThis is the required value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3079292"}]}
