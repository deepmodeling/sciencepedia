The domain and codomain are endowed with the standard Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$, making $(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ a Riemannian manifold.\n\nThe first task is to compute the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at the point $(0,0)$ and its determinant. The differential of the map, $d f_{(x,y)}$, is represented by the Jacobian matrix $J_{f}(x,y)$.

The IFT states that since $f$ is a smooth map and its differential $d f_{(0,0)}$ is invertible, there exist open neighborhoods $U$ of $(0,0)$ and $V$ of $f(0,0)=(0+\\sin(0), 0) = (0,0)$ such that the restriction $f\\vert_{U}: U \\to V$ is a diffeomorphism. This formally justifies the existence of such a neighborhood $U$.\n\nTo provide an explicit choice for $U$, we can investigate the invertibility of $f$ on a larger domain. The determinant of the Jacobian at a general point $(x,y)$ is $\\det(J_{f}(x,y)) = (1)(1) - (\\cos y)(0) = 1$. Since the determinant is non-zero for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at every point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. To determine if $f$ is a global diffeomorphism, we must check for injectivity and surjectivity on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nFor injectivity, assume $f(x_1, y_1) = f(x_2, y_2)$. This yields the system of equations:\n$$\nx_1 + \\sin y_1 = x_2 + \\sin y_2\n$$\n$$\ny_1 = y_2\n$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives $x_1 + \\sin y_1 = x_2 + \\sin y_1$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $(x_1, y_1) = (x_2, y_2)$, and the map $f$ is injective over its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nFor surjectivity, let $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ be an arbitrary point in the codomain. We seek a point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $f(x,y) = (u,v)$. This gives the system:\n$$\nx + \\sin y = u\n$$\n$$\ny = v\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we have $y=v$. Substituting this into the first equation yields $x + \\sin v = u$, which gives $x = u - \\sin v$. Thus, for any $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the point $(x,y) = (u - \\sin v, v)$ is a preimage under $f$. The map is therefore surjective.\nSince $f$ is injective, surjective, and a local diffeomorphism everywhere, it is a global diffeomorphism from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Consequently, we can choose any open neighborhood of $(0,0)$, including the entire space $U = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe third task is to find an explicit formula for the inverse $f^{-1}$ and verify its smoothness. As derived during the surjectivity check, for a given $(u,v)$ in the codomain, the corresponding $(x,y)$ in the domain is given by:\n$$\nx = u - \\sin v\n$$\n$$\ny = v\n$$\nThus, the inverse function $f^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by:\n$$\nf^{-1}(u,v) = (u - \\sin v, v)\n$$\nTo verify the smoothness of $f^{-1}$, we examine its component functions, $x(u,v) = u - \\sin v$ and $y(u,v) = v$. The function $y(u,v)$ is a linear polynomial and is therefore smooth ($C^{\\infty}$). The function $x(u,v)$ is the sum of a linear polynomial $u$ and the function $-\\sin v$. The sine function is a $C^{\\infty}$ function, and compositions and sums of $C^{\\infty}$ functions are also $C^{\\infty}$. Therefore, both component functions of $f^{-1}$ are smooth on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which means $f^{-1}$ is a smooth map. This is consistent with the conclusion from the IFT.\n\nThe final answer is the vector-valued analytic expression for $f^{-1}(u,v)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nu - \\sin v & v\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3053790"}, {"introduction": "While the Inverse Function Theorem deals with inverting functions, the closely related Implicit Function Theorem allows us to untangle variables within equations that define geometric objects.

The required condition is $\\partial_{y}F(x_{0},y_{0})\\neq 0$. Let's choose a simple point to test. If we set $y_{0}=0$, the equation of the ellipse $F(x,y)=0$ becomes $x_{0}^{2}+2x_{0}(0)+3(0)^{2}-1=0$, which simplifies to $x_{0}^{2}=1$. We can choose $x_{0}=1$. So, we select the point $(x_{0},y_{0})=(1,0)$.\nWe verify that this point lies on the ellipse:\n$$F(1,0) = 1^{2}+2(1)(0)+3(0)^{2}-1 = 1-1=0$$\nThe point $(1,0)$ is indeed on the ellipse.\n\nNext, we verify the hypotheses of the Implicit Function Theorem at $(x_{0},y_{0})=(1,0)$:\n1.

For $f(x,y)=(x,y^{2})$, the differential $d_{p}f$ has full rank at every $p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so by the Inverse Function Theorem the map is a local diffeomorphism everywhere.**\nAs shown above, the determinant of the Jacobian is $2y$, which is zero for all points on the line $y=0$. At these points, the rank of $d_p f$ is $1$, not $2$. Therefore, the differential does not have full rank everywhere. The conclusion is also false; the map is not a local diffeomorphism at points where $y=0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. For $f(x,y)=(x,y^{2})$, the differential $d_{p}f$ drops rank exactly along the curve $\\{(x,0):x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$; at points with $y\\neq 0$ the map is a local diffeomorphism, while at points $p=(x_{0},0)$ the image of a sufficiently small rectangle centered at $p$ is a folded strip whose edge lies on the line $\\{(x,0):x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$. In particular, for $(u,v)$ near $(x_{0},0)$ with $v0$ there are exactly $2$ preimages, and for $v0$ there are no preimages.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes our findings.\n- The rank drops for $y=0$, which is the curve $\\{(x,0):x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n- For $y\\neq 0$, the rank is full, and by the IFT, $f$ is a local diffeomorphism.\n- The image structure is correctly described as a fold.

For $f(x,y)=(x,y^{2})$, the set of critical values is a cusp given by $\\{(x,y):y^{2}=x^{3}\\}$, so the image of a small neighborhood of a critical point self-intersects.**\nThe set of critical points is $\\{(x,0) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. The set of critical values is the image of this set: $f(\\{(x,0)\\}) = \\{(x,0) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. This is a line, not a cusp. A canonical cusp singularity form is given by the map $(x,y) \\mapsto (x, y^3 - xy)$, and its set of critical values locally resembles the curve $u^2 = cv^3$. The curve given in the option, $y^2=x^3$ (using target coordinates $u,v$, this would be $v^2=u^3$), describes the shape of a cusp, but this is not the set of critical values for our map $f$.

The map $g(x,y)=(x^{2},y)$ also has differential of corank $1$ along the curve $\\{(0,y):y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$, so $g$ is not locally invertible there and its image near such points exhibits a fold with edge along the line $\\{(0,y):y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$ in the target.**\nLet's analyze $g(x,y)=(x^2,y)$. The Jacobian is $J_g(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $2x$.\n- The rank drops when $x=0$. The set of critical points is the $y$-axis, $\\{(0,y):y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n- On this set, the Jacobian is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank $1$. The dimension is $2$, so the corank (dimension - rank) is $2-1=1$. This is correct.\n- By the same reasoning as for $f$, $g$ is not locally invertible on its critical set.\n- The set of critical values is $g(\\{(0,y)\\}) = \\{(0^2,y)\\} = \\{(0,y):y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$, which is the vertical axis in the target.\n- The image of any point $(x,y)$ has a non-negative first component, $u=x^2 \\ge 0$. The image of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ under $g$ is the right half-plane $u \\ge 0$. The critical value set is the boundary of this half-plane. This describes a fold with the edge along the line $\\{(0,y):y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$ in the target space.\n- The statement is therefore accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The Implicit Function Theorem applies at a point $(x_{0},0)$ to solve $y^{2}=v$ for $y$ as a single-valued smooth function of $v$ near $v=0$, producing a local smooth inverse for $f$ across the fold.**\nTo find an inverse for $f(x,y)=(x,y^2)$, we need to solve $(u,v) = (x,y^2)$ for $(x,y)$. This gives $x=u$ and $y^2=v$. We need to solve the second equation for $y$ in terms of $v$. Let's define a function $H(v,y) = y^2 - v$. We want to solve $H(v,y)=0$ for $y$ as a function of $v$. The critical points in the domain $(x_0, 0)$ map to $(x_0, 0)$ in the codomain. We are therefore interested in the behavior near the point $(v,y)=(0,0)$. The Implicit Function Theorem states that we can solve for $y$ if $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} \\neq 0$ at the point of interest.\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 2y$. At $(v,y)=(0,0)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 0$. The condition of the Implicit Function Theorem is violated. Therefore, it does *not* apply to guarantee a single-valued smooth solution for $y(v)$ near $v=0$. Indeed, the solution is $y=\\pm\\sqrt{v}$, which is multi-valued and not smooth at $v=0$ (the derivative is undefined). The failure of the Implicit Function Theorem here is the formal reason for the lack of a smooth local inverse across the fold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "3053754"}]}
