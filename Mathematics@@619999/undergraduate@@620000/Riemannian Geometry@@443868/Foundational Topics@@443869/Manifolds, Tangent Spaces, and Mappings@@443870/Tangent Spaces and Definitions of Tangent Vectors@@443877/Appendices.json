By definition, there exists a smooth curve $\\gamma: (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\to S^{n}$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $\\gamma(0) = p$ and the velocity vector at $t=0$ is $\\gamma'(0) = v$.\n\nSince the curve $\\gamma(t)$ lies on the sphere $S^{n}$ for all $t$ in its domain, it must satisfy the defining equation of the sphere:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = 1\n$$\nThis equation holds for all $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. We can differentiate both sides with respect to $t$. The derivative of the constant $1$ is $0$. For the left-hand side, we use the product rule for differentiation of an inner product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\gamma'(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle + \\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle\n$$\nSince the standard Euclidean inner product is symmetric, this becomes:\n$$\n2 \\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis relation is true for all $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. In particular, it must hold at $t=0$:\n$$\n2 \\langle \\gamma(0), \\gamma'(0) \\rangle = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma'(0) = v$, we obtain:\n$$\n2 \\langle p, v \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\langle p, v \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis shows that any tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}S^{n}$ must be orthogonal to the position vector $p$. This implies that the tangent space is a subset of the orthogonal complement of the span of $p$: $T_{p}S^{n} \\subseteq \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\langle p, v \\rangle = 0\\}$.\n\nTo prove equality, we must show that any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ satisfying $\\langle p, v \\rangle = 0$ is indeed a tangent vector at $p$. Let $v$ be such a vector. If $v$ is the zero vector, it is trivially a tangent vector (e.g., from the constant curve $\\gamma(t)=p$). If $v \\neq 0$, consider the curve $\\gamma(t)$ defined as:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = (\\cos(|v|t))p + \\left(\\frac{\\sin(|v|t)}{|v|}\\right)v\n$$\nwhere $|v| = \\sqrt{\\langle v,v \\rangle}$. We verify that this curve satisfies the required conditions.\nFirst, $\\gamma(0) = (\\cos(0))p + \\left(\\frac{\\sin(0)}{|v|}\\right)v = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot v = p$.\nSecond, the velocity vector is $\\gamma'(t) = -|v|\\sin(|v|t)p + \\cos(|v|t)v$. At $t=0$, we have $\\gamma'(0) = -|v|\\sin(0)p + \\cos(0)v = 0 \\cdot p + 1 \\cdot v = v$.\nThird, we check if $\\gamma(t)$ lies on $S^{n}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = \\left\\langle (\\cos(|v|t))p + \\left(\\frac{\\sin(|v|t)}{|v|}\\right)v, (\\cos(|v|t))p + \\left(\\frac{\\sin(|v|t)}{|v|}\\right)v \\right\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity of the inner product:\n$$\n= \\cos^2(|v|t)\\langle p, p \\rangle + 2\\cos(|v|t)\\frac{\\sin(|v|t)}{|v|}\\langle p, v \\rangle + \\frac{\\sin^2(|v|t)}{|v|^2}\\langle v, v \\rangle\n$$\nWe know $\\langle p,p \\rangle=1$ (since $p \\in S^{n}$), we assumed $\\langle p,v \\rangle=0$, and $\\langle v,v \\rangle=|v|^2$. Substituting these values:\n$$\n= \\cos^2(|v|t) \\cdot 1 + 0 + \\frac{\\sin^2(|v|t)}{|v|^2} \\cdot |v|^2 = \\cos^2(|v|t) + \\sin^2(|v|t) = 1\n$$\nThus, the curve $\\gamma(t)$ lies on $S^{n}$ for all $t$. We have successfully constructed a curve on $S^n$ passing through $p$ with velocity $v$. Therefore, any vector $v$ orthogonal to $p$ is in $T_p S^n$.\nThe characterization of the tangent space is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are orthogonal to the position vector $p$:\n$$\nT_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\langle p, v \\rangle = 0\\}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Projection Calculation**\n\nWe specialize to the case $n=2$, with $p=\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\in S^2$ and $u=(2,-1,5) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The tangent space $T_{p}S^{2}$ is the plane through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with normal vector $p$.\n\nAny vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ can be uniquely decomposed into a component $u_{\\parallel}$ parallel to the plane $T_{p}S^{2}$ and a component $u_{\\perp}$ orthogonal to it. The component $u_{\\parallel}$ is the orthogonal projection of $u$ onto $T_{p}S^{2}$. The component $u_{\\perp}$ is the projection of $u$ onto the normal direction, which is spanned by $p$.\n$$\nu = u_{\\parallel} + u_{\\perp}\n$$\nwhere $u_{\\parallel} \\in T_pS^2$ and $u_{\\perp}$ is in the orthogonal complement of $T_pS^2$. The orthogonal complement of $T_pS^2$ is the line spanned by $p$. Therefore, $u_{\\perp} = \\text{proj}_{p}(u)$.\n\nThe projection of $u$ onto the vector $p$ is given by:\n$$\nu_{\\perp} = \\text{proj}_{p}(u) = \\frac{\\langle u, p \\rangle}{\\langle p, p \\rangle} p\n$$\nSince $p \\in S^2$, we have $\\langle p, p \\rangle = |p|^2 = 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$$\nu_{\\perp} = \\langle u, p \\rangle p\n$$\nThe problem asks for the squared length of the orthogonal projection of $u$ onto $T_{p}S^{2}$, which is $|u_{\\parallel}|^2$. Since $u_{\\parallel}$ and $u_{\\perp}$ are orthogonal, the Pythagorean theorem applies:\n$$\n|u|^2 = |u_{\\parallel}|^2 + |u_{\\perp}|^2\n$$\nTherefore, $|u_{\\parallel}|^2 = |u|^2 - |u_{\\perp}|^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute $|u|^2$:\n$$\n|u|^2 = \\langle u, u \\rangle = \\langle(2,-1,5), (2,-1,5)\\rangle = 2^2 + (-1)^2 + 5^2 = 4+1+25 = 30\n$$\nNext, we compute $|u_{\\perp}|^2$. The length of $u_{\\perp}$ is:\n$$\n|u_{\\perp}|^2 = \\langle u_{\\perp}, u_{\\perp} \\rangle = \\langle \\langle u, p \\rangle p, \\langle u, p \\rangle p \\rangle = (\\langle u, p \\rangle)^2 \\langle p, p \\rangle = (\\langle u, p \\rangle)^2\n$$\nWe calculate the inner product $\\langle u, p \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle u, p \\rangle = \\left\\langle (2, -1, 5), \\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\right\\rangle = (2)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + (-1)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + (5)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\nSo, $|u_{\\perp}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{100}{9}$.\n\nFinally, we find the squared length of the projection onto the tangent space:\n$$\n|u_{\\parallel}|^2 = |u|^2 - |u_{\\perp}|^2 = 30 - \\frac{100}{9} = \\frac{30 \\cdot 9}{9} - \\frac{100}{9} = \\frac{270 - 100}{9} = \\frac{170}{9}\n$$\nThis is an exact rational number as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{170}{9}}$$", "id": "3067533"}, {"introduction": "While the geometric picture is intuitive, a more powerful and generalizable approach defines tangent vectors as algebraic objects called derivations.

Show that for each $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, the map $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p} : C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n}) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p}(f) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p)$ is a derivation at $p$.\n\nA derivation at $p$ must satisfy two properties: it must be a linear map from $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, and it must satisfy the Leibniz rule. Let us verify these for the operator $D_{i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p}$.\n\nFirst, we verify linearity. Let $f, g \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The partial derivative operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$ is linear. Therefore,\n$$D_{i}(af+bg) = \\frac{\\partial(af+bg)}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = \\left(a\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}} + b\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right)(p) = a\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) + b\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = aD_{i}(f) + bD_{i}(g).$$\nThus, $D_{i}$ is a linear map.\n\nSecond, we verify the Leibniz rule. For $f, g \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, the standard product rule for partial differentiation states that $\\frac{\\partial(fg)}{\\partial x^{i}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}g + f\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^{i}}$. Evaluating this at the point $p$ gives:\n$$D_{i}(fg) = \\frac{\\partial(fg)}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p)g(p) + f(p)\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = g(p)D_{i}(f) + f(p)D_{i}(g).$$\nThis is precisely the Leibniz rule as defined in the problem, with the evaluation of the functions at $p$. Both conditions are satisfied, so $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p}$ is a derivation at $p$ for each $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$.\n\n2. Prove that any derivation $D$ at $p$ is uniquely determined by the $n$ real numbers $D(x^{1}),\\dots,D(x^{n})$.\n\n3. Compute a formula for $D(f)$ in terms of $D(x^{i})$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p)$ for arbitrary $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$.\n\nWe will address parts 2 and 3 together, as the formula derived in part 3 will serve as the proof for part 2. Let $D$ be an arbitrary derivation at $p$.\n\nFirst, we establish a necessary property of any derivation. Let $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be a constant, and let $c(x)$ denote the constant function with value $c$. The function $1(x) = 1$ satisfies $1(x) = 1(x) \\cdot 1(x)$. Applying the Leibniz rule to the function $1$:\n$$D(1) = D(1 \\cdot 1) = 1(p)D(1) + 1(p)D(1) = 1 \\cdot D(1) + 1 \\cdot D(1) = 2D(1).$$\nThis implies $D(1) = 0$. By linearity, for any constant function $c(x)=c$, we have $D(c) = D(c \\cdot 1) = c D(1) = c \\cdot 0 = 0$. Thus, any derivation maps any constant function to zero.\n\nNow, let $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ be an arbitrary smooth function. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we can write for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$f(x) - f(p) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{d}{dt} f(p + t(x-p)) \\, dt.$$\nBy the chain rule for functions of several variables, the derivative inside the integral is:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} f(p + t(x-p)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p + t(x-p)) (x^{i} - p^{i}).$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$f(x) - f(p) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p + t(x-p)) (x^{i} - p^{i}) \\, dt = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x^{i} - p^{i}) \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p + t(x-p)) \\, dt.$$\nLet us define the functions $g_{i}(x)$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$ as:\n$$g_{i}(x) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p + t(x-p)) \\, dt.$$\nSince $f$ is smooth, its partial derivatives are smooth. The integral of a smooth function with respect to a parameter is also smooth (a standard result from advanced calculus). Thus, each $g_{i}$ is a smooth function, i.e., $g_{i} \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$. The expression for $f$ can be written as a function:\n$$f(x) = f(p) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x^{i} - p^{i}) g_{i}(x).$$\nLet's evaluate $g_i(x)$ at $x=p$:\n$$g_{i}(p) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) \\, dt = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) \\int_{0}^{1} dt = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p).$$\nNow we apply the derivation $D$ to the function $f$. We interpret the expression for $f(x)$ as an equality of functions. Let $c_{f(p)}$ be the constant function with value $f(p)$, and let $c_{p^i}$ be the constant function with value $p^i$. The function $x^i$ is the $i$-th coordinate function.\n$$f = c_{f(p)} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x^{i} - c_{p^i}) g_{i}.$$\nUsing the linearity of $D$:\n$$D(f) = D(c_{f(p)}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} D((x^{i} - c_{p^i}) g_{i}).$$\nAs we showed, $D(c_{f(p)}) = 0$. Applying the Leibniz rule to each term in the sum:\n$$D((x^{i} - c_{p^i}) g_{i}) = g_{i}(p) D(x^{i} - c_{p^i}) + (p^{i} - p^{i}) D(g_{i}).$$\nHere, we used the fact that the function $x^i - c_{p^i}$ evaluates to $p^i - p^i = 0$ at the point $p$. The second term vanishes:\n$$D((x^{i} - c_{p^i}) g_{i}) = g_{i}(p) D(x^{i} - c_{p^i}) + 0 \\cdot D(g_{i}) = g_{i}(p) D(x^{i} - c_{p^i}).$$\nUsing linearity again, $D(x^{i} - c_{p^i}) = D(x^i) - D(c_{p^i}) = D(x^i) - 0 = D(x^i)$. Substituting this and the expression for $g_i(p)$:\n$$D((x^{i} - c_{p^i}) g_{i}) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) D(x^{i}).$$\nSumming over all $i$, we obtain the final formula for $D(f)$:\n$$D(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) D(x^{i}).$$\nThis is the formula required for part 3. This formula expresses the action of $D$ on any smooth function $f$ as a linear combination of the partial derivatives of $f$ at $p$, with coefficients being the $n$ real numbers $D(x^1), \\dots, D(x^n)$. Therefore, if these $n$ numbers are known, the action of $D$ is completely determined for any $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. This proves the assertion in part 2.\n\n4. Conclude that $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an $n$-dimensional real vector space with basis $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, and that it is naturally identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by sending a vector $(v^{1},\\dots,v^{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to the associated derivation at $p$.\n\nLet $v^{i} = D(x^{i})$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$. These are $n$ real numbers. The formula from part 3 can be rewritten as expressing the operator $D$ itself:\n$$D = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\bigg|_{p}.$$\nThis shows that any derivation $D \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be written as a linear combination of the operators $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$. This means this set of $n$ derivations spans the vector space $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nTo show it is a basis, we must demonstrate linear independence. Suppose there exist scalars $c^{1},\\dots,c^{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\bigg|_{p} = 0,$$\nwhere $0$ is the zero derivation (the map that sends every function to $0$). For this equality of operators to hold, they must have the same action on every function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$. Let us choose the specific coordinate functions $f(x) = x^{j}$ for $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$. Applying the operator to $x^j$:\n$$\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\bigg|_{p}\\right)(x^{j}) = 0.$$\nBy linearity, this is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = 0.$$\nThe partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}}$ is equal to the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$, which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ if $i \\neq j$. So,\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\delta_{ij} = c^{j}.$$\nThe equation thus simplifies to $c^{j} = 0$. Since this holds for each $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, all coefficients $c^j$ must be zero. This proves that the set of derivations $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is linearly independent.\n\nSince this set both spans $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ and is linearly independent, it forms a basis for $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$. The dimension of a vector space is the number of elements in its basis, which is $n$. Therefore, $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an $n$-dimensional real vector space.\n\nThe natural identification between $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ arises directly from this basis representation. We can define a map $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ that sends a vector $v = (v^1, \\dots, v^n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ to the derivation whose components in the basis $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\big|_{p}\\right\\}$ are the components of $v$. That is:\n$$\\Phi(v) = D_{v} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\bigg|_{p}.$$\nThis map is a vector space isomorphism, providing a natural identification between the geometric space of derivations and the algebraic space $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nFinally, the explicit closed-form expression for the derivation $D_{v}$ corresponding to an arbitrary vector $v = (v^{1},\\dots,v^{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is this very same expression.

The manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}$ is the simplest non-trivial example. The charts are well-defined; $\\varphi_1(x)=x$ is the identity chart. For $\\varphi_2(x)=2x+x^3$, its derivative is $\\varphi_2'(x)=2+3x^2$, which is never zero. Thus, $\\varphi_2$ is a valid diffeomorphism from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ and constitutes a valid chart. The definition of the tangent vector as a derivation is standard. The questions are precise, mathematical, and have unique answers based on these definitions. The problem is self-contained and consistent. It does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, and uses clear, objective language. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\n**Task 1: Compute the number assigned to $v$ in chart $\\varphi_{1}$.**\n\nThe \"naive coordinate-wise identification\" corresponds to finding the component of the tangent vector in the basis defined by the chart. This is found by computing the time derivative of the curve's representation in that coordinate system.\n\nThe curve is $\\gamma(t)=t$. The coordinate representation of $\\gamma$ in the chart $\\varphi_{1}$ is given by the composition $\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}(t) = \\varphi_{1}(\\gamma(t))$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}(t) = \\varphi_{1}(t) = t\n$$\nThe number assigned to $v$ in this chart is the derivative of $\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}(t)$ with respect to $t$, evaluated at $t=0$.\n$$\nv_{1} = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}(t)\\right|_{t=0} = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}(t)\\right|_{t=0} = 1\n$$\nSo, the number for chart $\\varphi_{1}$ is $1$.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the number assigned to $v$ in chart $\\varphi_{2}$.**\n\nSimilarly, we find the coordinate representation of $\\gamma$ in the chart $\\varphi_{2}$, which is $\\hat{\\gamma}_{2}(t) = \\varphi_{2}(\\gamma(t))$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{2}(t) = \\varphi_{2}(t) = 2t+t^{3}\n$$\nThe number assigned to $v$ in this chart is the derivative of $\\hat{\\gamma}_{2}(t)$ with respect to $t$, evaluated at $t=0$.\n$$\nv_{2} = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\hat{\\gamma}_{2}(t)\\right|_{t=0} = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}(2t+t^{3})\\right|_{t=0} = \\left.(2+3t^{2})\\right|_{t=0} = 2+3(0)^{2} = 2\n$$\nSo, the number for chart $\\varphi_{2}$ is $2$.\n\nThis illustrates the core principle that the components of a tangent vector are chart-dependent.\n\n**Task 3: Compute $v(f)$ and explain chart independence.**\n\nThe tangent vector $v$ is defined as an operator on smooth functions $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$ by $v(f)=\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}f(\\gamma(t))\\right|_{t=0}$. We are given the function $f(x)=x^{2}+3x$.\n\nFirst, we compose the function $f$ with the curve $\\gamma(t)=t$:\n$$\nf(\\gamma(t)) = f(t) = t^{2}+3t\n$$\nNext, we differentiate this expression with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}f(\\gamma(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^{2}+3t) = 2t+3\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$\nv(f) = \\left.(2t+3)\\right|_{t=0} = 2(0)+3 = 3\n$$\nThe value of $v(f)$ is $3$.\n\nThis value is independent of the chosen chart for a fundamental reason. The definition of $v(f)$ relies only on the function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and the curve $\\gamma: (-1,1) \\to M$. Both of these are intrinsic objects, defined on the manifold $M$ itself without reference to any coordinate system. The composition $f \\circ \\gamma$ is a map from an interval of $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, and its derivative is a standard operation in calculus that does not require any manifold-related coordinate charts. Since no step in the calculation of $v(f)$ involves a choice of chart, the result must be chart-independent. This demonstrates that the tangent vector $v$, when viewed as a derivation, is a geometric object independent of coordinates, even though its components in a coordinate basis change from chart to chart.\n\n**Task 4: Compute the ratio.**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the number computed in chart $\\varphi_{2}$ to the number computed in chart $\\varphi_{1}$.\nFrom Task 1, the number for chart $\\varphi_{1}$ is $v_{1}=1$.\nFrom Task 2, the number for chart $\\varphi_{2}$ is $v_{2}=2$.\n\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n$$\nThis ratio is the value of the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation at the point $p$. The transformation from $\\varphi_{1}$ coordinates (let's call them $x$) to $\\varphi_{2}$ coordinates (let's call them $y$) is $y(x) = \\varphi_{2}(\\varphi_{1}^{-1}(x)) = \\varphi_{2}(x) = 2x+x^{3}$. The Jacobian is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2+3x^{2}$. At the point $p=0$, $x=0$, so the Jacobian is $2+3(0)^2=2$, which matches our ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3067492"}]}
