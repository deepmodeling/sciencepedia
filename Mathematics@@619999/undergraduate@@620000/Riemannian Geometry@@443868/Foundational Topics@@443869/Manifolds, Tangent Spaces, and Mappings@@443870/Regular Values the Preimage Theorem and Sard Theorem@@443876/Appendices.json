It presents a standard exercise in differential geometry concerning a smooth map between Euclidean spaces, utilizing fundamental theorems such as the preimage theorem and Sard's theorem. All terms are clearly defined and the objectives are unambiguous. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem investigates the smooth map $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x,y) = x^{3} + y$. The domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ are considered as Riemannian manifolds endowed with their standard Euclidean metrics.\n\n**1. Computation of the Differential**\n\nThe differential (or pushforward) of the map $f$ at a point $p=(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a linear map $df_{p} \\colon T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to T_{f(p)}\\mathbb{R}$. In the standard coordinates of Euclidean space, the tangent spaces $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $T_{f(p)}\\mathbb{R}$ are identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ respectively. The differential is represented by the Jacobian matrix of $f$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J_f(x,y)$ is a $1 \\times 2$ matrix of partial derivatives:\n$$ J_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $f(x,y) = x^{3} + y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 1 $$\nThus, the Jacobian matrix representing the differential $df_{(x,y)}$ with respect to the standard bases of $T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $T_{f(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}$ is:\n$$ df_{(x,y)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3x^{2}  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**2. Identification of Critical Points and Regular Values**\n\nA point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a **critical point** of $f$ if the differential $df_{p}$ is not surjective. Since the codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$, which has dimension $1$, the tangent space $T_{f(p)}\\mathbb{R}$ is $1$-dimensional. The differential $df_{p} \\colon T_p\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T_{f(p)}\\mathbb{R}$ is a linear map from a $2$-dimensional space to a $1$-dimensional space. Such a map fails to be surjective if and only if it is the zero map. In terms of the Jacobian matrix, this means the matrix must be the zero matrix.\nWe set the Jacobian matrix to zero:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 3x^{2}  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives the system of equations:\n$$ 3x^{2} = 0 $$\n$$ 1 = 0 $$\nThe second equation, $1=0$, is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for which the Jacobian matrix is the zero matrix. The rank of $df_{(x,y)}$ is always $1$, which is the dimension of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$. Consequently, $df_{(x,y)}$ is surjective for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nThis implies that the set of critical points of $f$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nThe problem also suggests validating this by checking where the gradient $\\nabla f$ vanishes. For a function on a Euclidean space with the standard metric, the condition for a critical point is $\\nabla f = \\mathbf{0}$. The gradient vector is given by $\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right)$.\n$$ \\nabla f(x,y) = (3x^{2}, 1) $$\nSetting the gradient to the zero vector gives $(3x^{2}, 1) = (0, 0)$, which is impossible as already demonstrated. This confirms that there are no critical points.\n\nA value $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a **critical value** if it is the image of a critical point. Since the set of critical points is empty, the set of critical values is also the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\nA value $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a **regular value** if it is not a critical value. Since the set of critical values is empty, every value $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a regular value.\n\n**3. Dimension of the Level Set via the Preimage Theorem**\n\nThe **Preimage Theorem** (also known as the Regular Level Set Theorem) states that if $f \\colon M \\to N$ is a smooth map between manifolds and $c \\in N$ is a regular value of $f$, then the level set (or preimage) $f^{-1}(c)$ is a regular submanifold of $M$ whose dimension is given by $\\dim(M) - \\dim(N)$.\n\nIn our problem, $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, so $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $N = \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe dimensions are $\\dim(M) = 2$ and $\\dim(N) = 1$.\nAs established in the previous step, every $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a regular value of $f$.\nTherefore, for any arbitrary $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the level set $M_{c} = f^{-1}(c) = \\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x^{3} + y = c \\}$ is a regular submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nThe dimension $d$ of this submanifold is:\n$$ d = \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^{2}) - \\dim(\\mathbb{R}) = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\nSo, for any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the level set $M_c$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold (a curve). This is consistent with the explicit form of the level sets, which are graphs of the functions $y = c - x^3$.\n\n**4. Measure of Critical Values via Sard's Theorem**\n\n**Sard's Theorem** states that for any smooth map $f \\colon M \\to N$ between smooth manifolds, the set of critical values in $N$ has Lebesgue measure zero. Let $C \\subset M$ be the set of critical points of $f$. Then the Lebesgue measure of the image $f(C)$ in $N$ is zero.\n\nIn this case, the set of critical points $C$ of the map $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the empty set, $C = \\emptyset$.\nThe set of critical values is the image of the set of critical points under $f$, which is $f(C) = f(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$.\nThe Lebesgue measure of the empty set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is by definition zero.\nTherefore, the measure $m$ of the set of critical values is $m=0$.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimension $d$ of any level set $M_c$ is $1$, and the Lebesgue measure $m$ of the set of critical values is $0$.

We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe function is $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x,y) = x^{2} - y^{2}$, with $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ having the standard Euclidean metric. We are given a constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n(a) A value $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a regular value of $f$ if for every point $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$, the differential of $f$ at $p$, denoted $Df(p)$, is a surjective linear map. The function $f$ is a map from a $2$-dimensional manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to a $1$-dimensional manifold $\\mathbb{R}$. The differential $Df(p) \\colon T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to T_{f(p)}\\mathbb{R}$ is a linear map from a $2$-dimensional vector space to a $1$-dimensional vector space. Such a map is surjective if and only if it is not the zero map.\n\nWe compute the differential of $f$. The Jacobian matrix of $f$ is given by\n$$ Df(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x  -2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe differential $Df(x,y)$ is the zero map if and only if $2x = 0$ and $-2y = 0$, which occurs only at the point $(x,y) = (0,0)$. This point is the sole critical point of $f$.\n\nThe value of $f$ at the critical point is $f(0,0) = 0^{2} - 0^{2} = 0$. The set of critical values of $f$ is therefore $\\{0\\}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that $c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Thus, $c \\neq 0$. If a point $p=(x,y)$ is in the preimage $f^{-1}(c)$, then $f(x,y) = c \\neq 0$. This implies that $p$ cannot be the critical point $(0,0)$. Since $p \\neq (0,0)$, at least one of its coordinates is non-zero, meaning the differential $Df(p) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x  -2y \\end{pmatrix}$ is not the zero vector. Therefore, the linear map $Df(p)$ is surjective for all $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$.\n\nConclusion: $c$ is a regular value of $f$.\n\n(b) The preimage theorem states that if $f \\colon M \\to N$ is a smooth map between manifolds and $c \\in N$ is a regular value, then the preimage $f^{-1}(c)$ is a properly embedded submanifold of $M$ with dimension $\\dim(M) - \\dim(N)$.\nHere, $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $N = \\mathbb{R}$, so $\\dim(M) = 2$ and $\\dim(N) = 1$. Since $f(x,y) = x^{2} - y^{2}$ is a polynomial function, it is smooth. From part (a), $c$ is a regular value.\nTherefore, by the preimage theorem, $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth $1$-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nExplicitly, $f^{-1}(c)$ is the set $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x^{2} - y^{2} = c\\}$, which describes a hyperbola.\nIf $c > 0$, the hyperbola has two connected components (branches), one in the right half-plane ($x > 0$) and one in the left half-plane ($x  0$).\n- Right branch: parameterized by $\\gamma_{R}(t) = (\\sqrt{c} \\cosh(t), \\sqrt{c} \\sinh(t))$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- Left branch: parameterized by $\\gamma_{L}(t) = (-\\sqrt{c} \\cosh(t), \\sqrt{c} \\sinh(t))$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIf $c  0$, let $c' = -c > 0$. The equation is $y^{2}-x^{2}=c'$. The hyperbola has two branches, one in the upper half-plane ($y > 0$) and one in the lower half-plane ($y  0$).\n- Upper branch: parameterized by $\\gamma_{U}(t) = (\\sqrt{c'} \\sinh(t), \\sqrt{c'} \\cosh(t))$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- Lower branch: parameterized by $\\gamma_{L'}(t) = (\\sqrt{c'} \\sinh(t), -\\sqrt{c'} \\cosh(t))$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n(c) For a regular value $c$, the tangent space to the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ at a point $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$ is given by the kernel of the differential at that point, $T_{p}f^{-1}(c) = \\ker(Df(p))$.\nLet $p = (x_{0}, y_{0}) \\in f^{-1}(c)$. A tangent vector $v = (v_{x}, v_{y}) \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ lies in $\\ker(Df(p))$ if $Df(p)(v) = 0$.\n$$ Df(p)(v) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_{0}  -2y_{0} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{x} \\\\ v_{y} \\end{pmatrix} = 2x_{0}v_{x} - 2y_{0}v_{y} = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to the equation $x_{0}v_{x} - y_{0}v_{y} = 0$.\nThe tangent space is thus $T_{p}f^{-1}(c) = \\{(v_{x}, v_{y}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_{0}v_{x} - y_{0}v_{y} = 0\\}$.\n\nTo exhibit a nonzero tangent vector, we need to find a nonzero solution $(v_{x}, v_{y})$ to this equation. A straightforward choice is the vector $(y_{0}, x_{0})$. Let's check: $x_{0}(y_{0}) - y_{0}(x_{0}) = 0$. This vector is nonzero because if $(y_{0}, x_{0}) = (0,0)$, then $p=(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)$, which is not in $f^{-1}(c)$ as $c \\neq 0$. Thus, a nonzero tangent vector at $p=(x_{0},y_{0})$ is $(y_{0}, x_{0})$.\n\n(d) The set of critical points of $f$ consists of points where the differential is not surjective. As established in (a), this occurs only at $(0,0)$. The set of critical points is $C_f = \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nThe set of critical values is the image of the set of critical points under $f$.\n$$ f(C_f) = \\{f(0,0)\\} = \\{0\\} $$\nSo, the set of critical values is $\\{0\\}$.\n\nSard’s theorem states that for any smooth map between manifolds, the set of its critical values has Lebesgue measure zero in the codomain. Here, the codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$. The set of critical values is $\\{0\\}$, which is a singleton set. Any finite set of points in $\\mathbb{R}$ has Lebesgue measure zero. Therefore, the set $\\{0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero in $\\mathbb{R}$, which is consistent with Sard's theorem.\n\n(e) We are given $c > 0$ and the point $p = (\\sqrt{c}, 0)$, which lies on the right branch of the hyperbola $x^{2} - y^{2} = c$. We compute the curvature of this curve at $p$. Let's use the parametric representation for the right branch: $\\gamma(t) = (\\sqrt{c}\\cosh(t), \\sqrt{c}\\sinh(t))$. The point $p = (\\sqrt{c}, 0)$ corresponds to the parameter value $t=0$, since $\\cosh(0)=1$ and $\\sinh(0)=0$.\n\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ of a plane curve $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\kappa(t) = \\frac{|x'(t)y''(t) - y'(t)x''(t)|}{(x'(t)^{2} + y'(t)^{2})^{3/2}} $$\nFirst, we find the first and second derivatives of $\\gamma(t)$:\n- $x(t) = \\sqrt{c}\\cosh(t) \\implies x'(t) = \\sqrt{c}\\sinh(t) \\implies x''(t) = \\sqrt{c}\\cosh(t)$\n- $y(t) = \\sqrt{c}\\sinh(t) \\implies y'(t) = \\sqrt{c}\\cosh(t) \\implies y''(t) = \\sqrt{c}\\sinh(t)$\n\nNow, we evaluate these derivatives at $t=0$:\n- $x'(0) = \\sqrt{c}\\sinh(0) = 0$\n- $y'(0) = \\sqrt{c}\\cosh(0) = \\sqrt{c}$\n- $x''(0) = \\sqrt{c}\\cosh(0) = \\sqrt{c}$\n- $y''(0) = \\sqrt{c}\\sinh(0) = 0$\n\nSubstitute these values into the curvature formula:\nThe numerator is $|x'(0)y''(0) - y'(0)x''(0)| = |(0)(0) - (\\sqrt{c})(\\sqrt{c})| = |-c| = c$, since $c > 0$.\nThe denominator is $(x'(0)^{2} + y'(0)^{2})^{3/2} = ((0)^{2} + (\\sqrt{c})^{2})^{3/2} = (c)^{3/2} = c\\sqrt{c}$.\n\nThe curvature at point $p$ is:\n$$ \\kappa(p) = \\frac{c}{c\\sqrt{c}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} $$\nThis value is positive, so it is the unsigned curvature.\nThe unsigned curvature of the branch of $f^{-1}(c)$ at $p=(\\sqrt{c},0)$ is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}}$$", "id": "3062863"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice elevates the concept to maps between manifolds of equal dimension, where the Preimage Theorem yields a fascinating result.

A point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a critical point if the differential $df_{(x,y)}$ is not of full rank. The differential is represented by the Jacobian matrix $J_f(x,y)$. Let the components of $f$ be $f_1(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$ and $f_2(x,y) = 2xy$.

Therefore, the only critical point of $f$ is $(0,0)$.\n\nA value $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a critical value if it is the image of a critical point. The set of critical values is the image of the set of critical points. Since the only critical point is $(0,0)$, we compute its image:\n$$\nf(0,0) = (0^2 - 0^2, 2(0)(0)) = (0,0)\n$$\nThus, the set of critical values is $\\{(0,0)\\}$. This justifies that the origin $(0,0)$ is the sole critical value of $f$.\n\nSecond, we prove that any point $(a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ is a regular value. A value $v$ is regular if its preimage $f^{-1}(v)$ contains no critical points. As established, the only critical point is $(0,0)$. For any $(a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, we must determine if $(0,0)$ is in the preimage $f^{-1}((a,b))$.\nIf $(0,0) \\in f^{-1}((a,b))$, then by definition $f(0,0) = (a,b)$. We calculated that $f(0,0) = (0,0)$. This implies $(a,b)=(0,0)$, which contradicts our assumption that $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$.\nTherefore, for any $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$, the preimage $f^{-1}((a,b))$ does not contain the critical point $(0,0)$. Since $f^{-1}((a,b))$ contains only regular points, $(a,b)$ is a regular value by definition.\n\nThird, we determine the structure of $f^{-1}\\bigl((a,b)\\bigr)$ for a regular value $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$.\nThe domain manifold is $M = \\mathbb{R}^2$ of dimension $m=2$, and the codomain manifold is $N = \\mathbb{R}^2$ of dimension $n=2$. According to the Preimage Theorem, since $(a,b)$ is a regular value, the preimage $f^{-1}\\bigl((a,b)\\bigr)$ is a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ of dimension $m-n = 2-2=0$. A $0$-dimensional manifold is a discrete set of points.\n\nTo find the cardinality of this set, we must solve the system of equations for $(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n    x^2 - y^2 = a \\\\\n    2xy = b\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$.\n\nWe can solve this system algebraically.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then neither $x$ nor $y$ can be zero. From the second equation, we have $y = \\frac{b}{2x}$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\nx^2 - \\left(\\frac{b}{2x}\\right)^2 = a \\implies x^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4x^2} = a\n$$\nMultiplying by $4x^2$ (which is non-zero) gives a quadratic equation in $x^2$:\n$$\n4x^4 - 4ax^2 - b^2 = 0\n$$\nLet $X = x^2$. The equation is $4X^2 - 4aX - b^2 = 0$. Since $x$ must be real, we require $X \\geq 0$. Using the quadratic formula for $X$:\n$$\nX = \\frac{4a \\pm \\sqrt{(-4a)^2 - 4(4)(-b^2)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{4a \\pm \\sqrt{16a^2 + 16b^2}}{8} = \\frac{a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}{2}\n$$\nWe analyze the two possible values for $X = x^2$:\n1. $x^2 = \\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2} > \\sqrt{a^2}=|a|$, the numerator $a+\\sqrt{a^2+b^2} > a+|a| \\geq 0$. Thus, this value for $x^2$ is strictly positive. This yields two distinct real solutions for $x$: $x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}{2}}$.\n2. $x^2 = \\frac{a - \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2} > \\sqrt{a^2}=|a|$, the numerator $a-\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}  a-|a| \\leq 0$. Thus, this value for $x^2$ is strictly negative. It yields no real solutions for $x$.\n\nSo for any $(a,b)$ with $b \\neq 0$, there are exactly two real values for $x$. For each such $x$, the equation $y = \\frac{b}{2x}$ gives a unique corresponding value for $y$. This results in exactly two points $(x,y)$ in the preimage.\n\nIf $b = 0$, the system becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n    x^2 - y^2 = a \\\\\n    2xy = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSince $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$, we must have $a \\neq 0$. The second equation implies $x=0$ or $y=0$.\n1. If $x=0$, the first equation becomes $-y^2 = a$. If $a>0$, there are no real solutions for $y$. If $a0$, then $y^2 = -a$, which gives two solutions $y = \\pm\\sqrt{-a}$. This provides two points: $(0, \\sqrt{-a})$ and $(0, -\\sqrt{-a})$.\n2. If $y=0$, the first equation becomes $x^2 = a$.
