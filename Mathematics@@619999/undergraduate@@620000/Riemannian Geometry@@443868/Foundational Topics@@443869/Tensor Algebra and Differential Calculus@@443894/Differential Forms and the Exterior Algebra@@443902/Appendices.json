A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Exterior Derivative and Closedness of $\\omega$**\n\nThe given $1$-form on $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ is $\\omega = yz \\, dx + xz \\, dy + xy \\, dz$. This can be written as $\\omega = \\omega_x \\, dx + \\omega_y \\, dy + \\omega_z \\, dz$, where the component functions are $\\omega_x(x,y,z) = yz$, $\\omega_y(x,y,z) = xz$, and $\\omega_z(x,y,z) = xy$.\n\nThe exterior derivative of a $1$-form is a $2$-form, computed as $d\\omega = d\\omega_x \\wedge dx + d\\omega_y \\wedge dy + d\\omega_z \\wedge dz$. The differentials of the component functions are:\n$d\\omega_x = \\frac{\\partial(yz)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial(yz)}{\\partial y}dy + \\frac{\\partial(yz)}{\\partial z}dz = 0 \\cdot dx + z \\, dy + y \\, dz = z \\, dy + y \\, dz$.\n$d\\omega_y = \\frac{\\partial(xz)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial(xz)}{\\partial y}dy + \\frac{\\partial(xz)}{\\partial z}dz = z \\, dx + 0 \\cdot dy + x \\, dz = z \\, dx + x \\, dz$.\n$d\\omega_z = \\frac{\\partial(xy)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial(xy)}{\\partial y}dy + \\frac{\\partial(xy)}{\\partial z}dz = y \\, dx + x \\, dy + 0 \\cdot dz = y \\, dx + x \\, dy$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\omega$ and using the anticommutative property of the wedge product (e.g., $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$ and $dx \\wedge dx = 0$):\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nd\\omega &= (z \\, dy + y \\, dz) \\wedge dx + (z \\, dx + x \\, dz) \\wedge dy + (y \\, dx + x \\, dy) \\wedge dz \\\\\n&= z \\, dy \\wedge dx + y \\, dz \\wedge dx + z \\, dx \\wedge dy + x \\, dz \\wedge dy + y \\, dx \\wedge dz + x \\, dy \\wedge dz \\\\\n&= -z \\, dx \\wedge dy - y \\, dx \\wedge dz + z \\, dx \\wedge dy - x \\, dy \\wedge dz - y \\, dz \\wedge dx + x \\, dy \\wedge dz \\\\\n&= (-z+z) \\, dx \\wedge dy + (-y+y) \\, dx \\wedge dz + (-x+x) \\, dy \\wedge dz \\\\\n&= 0 \\, dx \\wedge dy + 0 \\, dx \\wedge dz + 0 \\, dy \\wedge dz = 0.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nAlternatively, for a $1$-form $\\omega = P \\, dx + Q \\, dy + R \\, dz$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the exterior derivative is:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial z}\\right) dy \\wedge dz + \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial x}\\right) dz \\wedge dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy.\n$$\nHere, $P=yz$, $Q=xz$, $R=xy$. The partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y} = x$, $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial z} = x \\implies \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} = y$, $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial x} = y \\implies \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = z$, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = z \\implies \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = 0$.\nAll coefficients are zero, thus $d\\omega = 0$. A differential form $\\omega$ is defined as closed if its exterior derivative is zero. Since $d\\omega=0$, $\\omega$ is a closed form.\n\n**2. Exactness of Closed Forms on a Star-Shaped Domain**\n\nA differential form $\\omega$ is exact if there exists a form $\\alpha$ of lower degree such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$. For a $1$-form $\\omega$, this means there exists a $0$-form (a scalar function) $F$ such that $\\omega = dF$. The function $F$ is called a potential function for $\\omega$.\n\nThe Poincaré Lemma states that on a contractible manifold, every closed form is exact. An open subset $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ that is star-shaped with respect to a point (in this case, the origin) is a contractible space. The homotopy that continuously shrinks $U$ to the origin is given by $H: U \\times [0,1] \\to U$, $H(p,s) = (1-s)p$. The fact that $U$ is star-shaped guarantees that the image of this map is within $U$.\n\nThe proof of the Poincaré Lemma provides a constructive method to find the potential function $F$. For a closed $1$-form $\\omega$ on a domain $U$ star-shaped with respect to the origin, the potential function $F$ at a point $p \\in U$ is given by the line integral of $\\omega$ along the straight-line path from the origin to $p$. Let this path be $\\gamma_p: [0,1] \\to U$, defined by $\\gamma_p(t) = tp$. The potential function is then defined as:\n$$\nF(p) = \\int_{\\gamma_p} \\omega = \\int_0^1 \\omega_{\\gamma_p(t)}(\\gamma_p'(t)) \\, dt.\n$$\nThe justification that this construction yields a function $F$ such that $dF = \\omega$ relies on the closedness of $\\omega$. Writing $p=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, $\\omega = \\sum_i \\omega_i(y) dy_i$, the definition becomes $F(p) = \\int_0^1 \\sum_i \\omega_i(tp) x_i \\, dt$. Differentiating with respect to $x_j$ using the Leibniz rule and the closedness condition $\\frac{\\partial \\omega_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_j}{\\partial x_i}$ leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_j}(p) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{d}{dt}(t \\cdot \\omega_j(tp)) \\, dt = [t \\cdot \\omega_j(tp)]_{t=0}^{t=1} = 1 \\cdot \\omega_j(p) - 0 = \\omega_j(p).\n$$\nSince this holds for all components $j$, we have $dF = \\sum_j \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_j} dx_j = \\sum_j \\omega_j dx_j = \\omega$. This confirms an exact form for the potential.\n\n**3. Computation of the Potential Function $F(x,y,z)$**\n\nWe apply the construction described above. Let a point in $U$ be denoted by its coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The path $\\gamma$ from the origin $(0,0,0)$ to $(x,y,z)$ is parametrized by $\\gamma(t) = (tx, ty, tz)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. The tangent vector to this path is $\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = (x, y, z)$.\n\nThe potential function $F(x,y,z)$ is the line integral of $\\omega$ along this path:\n$$\nF(x,y,z) = \\int_{\\gamma} \\omega = \\int_0^1 \\omega_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t)) \\, dt.\n$$\nThe form $\\omega$ is $\\omega = yz \\, dx + xz \\, dy + xy \\, dz$. We evaluate its components at the point $\\gamma(t)=(tx, ty, tz)$:\n-   Component for $dx$: $y(t) z(t) = (ty)(tz) = t^2 yz$.\n-   Component for $dy$: $x(t) z(t) = (tx)(tz) = t^2 xz$.\n-   Component for $dz$: $x(t) y(t) = (tx)(ty) = t^2 xy$.\n\nThe value of the $1$-form $\\omega$ on the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)=(x,y,z)$ at the point $\\gamma(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t)) = (t^2 yz)(x) + (t^2 xz)(y) + (t^2 xy)(z) = t^2 xyz + t^2 xyz + t^2 xyz = 3t^2 xyz.\n$$\nNow, we compute the integral with respect to $t$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\nF(x,y,z) = \\int_0^1 3t^2 xyz \\, dt.\n$$\nSince $x, y, z$ are constant with respect to the integration variable $t$, we can factor them out:\n$$\nF(x,y,z) = 3xyz \\int_0^1 t^2 \\, dt.\n$$\nThe integral of $t^2$ is $\\frac{t^3}{3}$:\n$$\nF(x,y,z) = 3xyz \\left[ \\frac{t^3}{3} \\right]_0^1 = 3xyz \\left( \\frac{1^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} \\right) = 3xyz \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = xyz.\n$$\nThus, the potential function is $F(x,y,z) = xyz$. We can verify this result by computing its differential:\n$$\ndF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} dy + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} dz = yz \\, dx + xz \\, dy + xy \\, dz,\n$$\nwhich is identical to the given $1$-form $\\omega$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{xyz}\n$$", "id": "3043799"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that closed forms are exact on star-shaped domains, we now investigate what happens when the domain has a 'hole'.

A $1$-form is closed if its exterior derivative is zero. For a $1$-form $\\alpha = P(x,y)\\,dx + Q(x,y)\\,dy$ on an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, its exterior derivative $d\\alpha$ is given by:\n$$\nd\\alpha = dP \\wedge dx + dQ \\wedge dy = \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}\\,dx + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\right) \\wedge dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dx + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\right) \\wedge dy\n$$\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, specifically $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, and $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy \\wedge dx + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dx \\wedge dy = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nFor the given form $\\omega$, we identify $P(x,y) = \\frac{-y}{x^{2} + y^{2}}$ and $Q(x,y) = \\frac{x}{x^{2} + y^{2}}$. We compute the required partial derivatives using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{-y}{x^{2} + y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(-1)(x^{2} + y^{2}) - (-y)(2y)}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{-x^{2} - y^{2} + 2y^{2}}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2} - x^{2}}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{x^{2} + y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(x^{2} + y^{2}) - (x)(2x)}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{x^{2} + y^{2} - 2x^{2}}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2} - x^{2}}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\left(\\frac{y^{2} - x^{2}}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2} - x^{2}}{(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2}}\\right) dx \\wedge dy = 0 \\cdot dx \\wedge dy = 0\n$$\nSince $d\\omega = 0$, the $1$-form $\\omega$ is closed on its domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nSecond, we compute the line integral $\\int_{S^{1}} \\omega$. The unit circle $S^{1}$ is parametrized by the map $\\gamma: [0, 2\\pi] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by $\\gamma(\\theta) = (x(\\theta), y(\\theta)) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$.

We have $x(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta$ and $y(\\theta) = \\sin\\theta$. The differentials are $dx = d(\\cos\\theta) = -\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta$ and $dy = d(\\sin\\theta) = \\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta$.

By definition, a $1$-form $\\omega$ is exact on a manifold $M$ if there exists a smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ (a $0$-form) such that $\\omega = df$.\nIf $\\omega$ were exact on $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, then there would exist such a function $f$. By the fundamental theorem for line integrals (a consequence of Stokes' theorem), the integral of an exact form over a path depends only on the values of the potential function $f$ at the endpoints of the path. For a closed path, such as the circle $S^{1}$, the starting and ending points are identical. Let the path be parametrized by $\\gamma: [a, b] \\to M$, where $\\gamma(a) = \\gamma(b)$.

As the path is closed, if $\\omega$ were exact, the integral must be:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{1}} \\omega = f(\\gamma(2\\pi)) - f(\\gamma(0)) = f(1,0) - f(1,0) = 0\n$$\nHowever, our direct computation yielded $\\int_{S^{1}} \\omega = 2\\pi$.

The integral is given by $\\int_{\\partial D} \\alpha = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma^*\\alpha$.\nWe compute the pullback $\\gamma^*\\alpha$:\n$$\\gamma^*\\alpha = \\gamma^*(x\\,dy) = (x \\circ \\gamma)(t) \\cdot d(y \\circ \\gamma)(t)$$\nThe pullback of the function $x$ is $x(\\gamma(t)) = \\cos t$.\nThe pullback of the differential $dy$ is $d(y(\\gamma(t))) = d(\\sin t) = (\\sin t)' dt = \\cos t \\,dt$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\gamma^*\\alpha$:\n$$\\gamma^*\\alpha = (\\cos t) (\\cos t \\,dt) = \\cos^2 t \\,dt$$\nNow we integrate this $1$-form over the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$:\n$$\\int_{\\partial D} \\alpha = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos^2 t \\,dt$$\nUsing the power-reduction identity $\\cos^2 t = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2t))$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2t))\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ t + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2t) \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(2\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(4\\pi)\\right) - \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(0)\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}((2\\pi + 0) - (0 + 0)) = \\pi$$\nThus, $\\int_{\\partial D} \\alpha = \\pi$.\n\nThe two integrals yield the same value, $\\pi$.
