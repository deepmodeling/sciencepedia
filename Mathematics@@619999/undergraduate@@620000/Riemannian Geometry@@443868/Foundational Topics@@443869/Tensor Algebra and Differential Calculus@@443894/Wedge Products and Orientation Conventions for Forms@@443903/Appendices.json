We are also asked to explain the relationship between the results in the context of Stokes' theorem.\n\nFirst, let's validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the closed unit disk, defined by the inequality $x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1$.\n-   The orientation on $M$ is the standard one determined by the $2$-form $dx \\wedge dy$.\n-   $\\omega$ is the $1$-form on $M$ given by $\\omega = x\\,dy$.\n-   A tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}\\partial M$ is defined to be positively oriented if and only if the ordered pair $(\\nu, v)$ is a positively oriented basis of $T_{p}M$.\n-   The normal vector $\\nu$ is chosen to be the inward-pointing unit normal on $\\partial M$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. It deals with standard concepts from differential geometry: manifolds, differential forms, exterior derivatives, integration, and orientation. The use of a nonstandard boundary orientation is a valid way to probe a student's understanding of the foundational role orientation plays in Stokes' theorem. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. It is not trivial, as it requires careful application of the definition of orientation. The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $\\int_{M} d\\omega$**\nThe given $1$-form is $\\omega = x\\,dy$. We first compute its exterior derivative, $d\\omega$.\nUsing the rules of exterior differentiation, $d(fg) = (df) \\wedge g + f \\wedge (dg)$, we have:\n$$d\\omega = d(x\\,dy) = (dx) \\wedge (dy) + x \\wedge d(dy)$$\nThe exterior derivative of a function (a $0$-form) like $y$ is the $1$-form $dy$. The exterior derivative of any exact form is zero, so $d(dy) = 0$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$d\\omega = dx \\wedge dy$$\nThe integral $\\int_{M} d\\omega$ is thus $\\int_{M} dx \\wedge dy$. The manifold $M$ is the closed unit disk, $\\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1 \\}$. The $2$-form $dx \\wedge dy$ is the standard area form on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The integral of the area form over a region gives the area of that region. The area of a unit disk is $\\pi r^2$ with $r=1$.\n$$\\int_{M} d\\omega = \\int_{M} dx \\wedge dy = \\text{Area}(M) = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi$$\nThus, the value of the integral over the manifold $M$ is $\\pi$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $\\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$ with the inward normal convention**\nThe boundary $\\partial M$ is the unit circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. We must first determine the orientation of $\\partial M$ as specified by the problem.\nThe convention states that a tangent vector $v \\in T_p \\partial M$ is positively oriented if the basis $(\\nu, v)$ is positively oriented for $T_p M$, where $\\nu$ is the inward-pointing unit normal.\nThe orientation of $T_p M$ is given by $dx \\wedge dy$. This means the standard basis $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$ is positively oriented. An ordered basis $(b_1, b_2)$ is positively oriented if the determinant of the matrix whose columns are the components of $b_1$ and $b_2$ is positive.\n\nLet's use a standard counter-clockwise parameterization for the unit circle: $p(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe tangent vector to this path is $v(\\theta) = p'(\\theta) = (-\\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta)$.\nAt a point $p(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ on the circle, the outward unit normal is $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$. The specified inward-pointing unit normal is therefore $\\nu(\\theta) = (-\\cos\\theta, -\\sin\\theta)$.\n\nNow we check if the basis $(\\nu(\\theta), v(\\theta))$ is positively oriented. We form a matrix with these vectors as columns and compute its determinant:\n$$\\det(\\nu(\\theta), v(\\theta)) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\cos\\theta)(\\cos\\theta) - (-\\sin\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta) = -\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta = -1$$\nSince the determinant is negative ($-1 < 0$), the basis $(\\nu(\\theta), v(\\theta))$ is negatively oriented with respect to the orientation on $M$. According to the problem's rule, this means the tangent vector $v(\\theta)$ (which points in the counter-clockwise direction) is **negatively oriented**.\nThe positive orientation on $\\partial M$ is therefore in the direction opposite to $v(\\theta)$, which is the clockwise direction.\n\nTo compute the integral $\\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$, we must integrate along the positively oriented direction, i.e., clockwise. We can use the parameterization $p(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ and integrate from $\\theta = 2\\pi$ to $\\theta = 0$.\nThe form is $\\omega = x\\,dy$. We pull back $\\omega$ to the parameter space of $\\theta$:\nOn the path, $x = \\cos\\theta$ and $y = \\sin\\theta$. Thus, $dy = d(\\sin\\theta) = \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta$.\nThe pullback $p^*\\omega$ is:\n$$p^*\\omega = (\\cos\\theta)(\\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta \\, d\\theta$$\nWe now integrate this from $2\\pi$ to $0$:\n$$\\int_{\\partial M} \\omega = \\int_{2\\pi}^{0} \\cos^2\\theta \\, d\\theta = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^2\\theta \\, d\\theta$$\nUsing the half-angle identity $\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$:\n$$ - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta)) \\, d\\theta = - \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta) \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (2\\pi + 0) - (0 + 0) \\right) = -\\pi$$\nThus, the value of the boundary integral under the specified orientation is $-\\pi$.\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of the Sign Difference and Required Correction**\nWe have found that $\\int_{M} d\\omega = \\pi$ and, using the problem's boundary orientation, $\\int_{\\partial M} \\omega = -\\pi$.\nThe generalized Stokes' theorem states $\\int_{M} d\\Omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\Omega$ for any $(k-1)$-form $\\Omega$ on a $k$-dimensional oriented manifold with boundary $M$. In our case ($k=2$), this is $\\int_{M} d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$.\nOur results show $\\int_{M} d\\omega = - \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$. This sign difference arises because the \"inward normal first\" convention induces an orientation on $\\partial M$ that is opposite to the one assumed in the standard statement of Stokes' theorem.\n\nThe standard (\"outward normal first\") convention for orienting $\\partial M$ is that a tangent vector $v \\in T_p\\partial M$ is positive if $(\\nu_{out}, v)$ is a positive basis for $T_pM$, where $\\nu_{out}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal. At $p(\\theta)$, $\\nu_{out}(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$. Let's check the orientation of $(\\nu_{out}(\\theta), v(\\theta))$ where $v(\\theta)$ is the counter-clockwise tangent vector:\n$$\\det(\\nu_{out}(\\theta), v(\\theta)) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos^2\\theta - (-\\sin^2\\theta) = 1$$\nSince the determinant is positive ($1 > 0$), the counter-clockwise direction is the positive orientation under the standard convention. This is the orientation for which Stokes' theorem holds in its usual form.\nOur \"inward normal first\" calculation yielded the clockwise direction as positive. The two conventions thus define opposite orientations on $\\partial M$.\n\nFrom first principles, let $\\partial M_{std}$ be the boundary with the standard orientation and $\\partial M_{inward}$ be the boundary with the orientation from the problem. The set of positively oriented tangent vectors for $\\partial M_{inward}$ is precisely the set of negatively oriented tangent vectors for $\\partial M_{std}$. This means that as oriented manifolds, $\\partial M_{inward} = -\\partial M_{std}$. The integral of a $1$-form over a curve reverses its sign when the orientation of the curve is reversed: $\\int_{-\\gamma} \\omega = -\\int_{\\gamma} \\omega$.\nTherefore, $\\int_{\\partial M_{inward}} \\omega = -\\int_{\\partial M_{std}} \\omega$.\nSince Stokes' theorem states $\\int_M d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M_{std}} \\omega$, it follows that $\\int_M d\\omega = - \\int_{\\partial M_{inward}} \\omega$, which is exactly what our calculation demonstrated ($\\pi = -(-\\pi)$).\n\nTo recover the usual sign in Stokes' theorem, i.e., to have $\\int_M d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$, one must use the boundary orientation that is compatible with the theorem. This requires reversing the orientation induced by the \"inward normal first\" rule. The correction is to replace the given orientation on $\\partial M$ with its opposite orientation, which corresponds to adopting the standard \"outward normal first\" convention.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\pi}$$", "id": "3080016"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice synthesizes the concepts of wedge products and orientation with the structure provided by a Riemannian metric.
