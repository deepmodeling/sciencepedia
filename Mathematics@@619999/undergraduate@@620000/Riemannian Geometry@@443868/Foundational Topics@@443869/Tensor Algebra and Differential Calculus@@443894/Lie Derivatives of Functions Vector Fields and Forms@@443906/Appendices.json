Let $\\phi_{t}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the flow generated by the vector field $X$. The flow $\\phi_{t}(p)$ describes the position at time $t$ of a particle that starts at point $p$ at time $t=0$ and moves along the integral curve of $X$. The Lie derivative of $f$ at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is then given by the rate of change of $f$ along this curve at $t=0$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{X}f)(p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(\\phi_{t}(p))\n$$\n\nFirst, we must compute the flow $\\phi_{t}$ of the vector field $X = x^{1}\\partial_{1}$. An integral curve $\\gamma(t) = (x^{1}(t), \\dots, x^{n}(t))$ of $X$ must satisfy the system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma(t)}{dt} = X_{\\gamma(t)}\n$$\nIn coordinates, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dx^{i}(t)}{dt} = X^{i}(\\gamma(t))\n$$\nFor the given vector field $X = x^{1}\\partial_{1}$, the components are $X^{1} = x^{1}$ and $X^{i} = 0$ for $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$. The system of ODEs is therefore:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dx^{1}}{dt} &= x^{1} \\\\\n\\frac{dx^{i}}{dt} &= 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}\n\\end{align*}\nLet the initial point at $t=0$ be $p = (p^{1}, \\dots, p^{n})$. We solve this system with the initial conditions $x^{i}(0) = p^{i}$.\n\nThe first equation, $\\frac{dx^{1}}{dt} = x^{1}$, is a separable first-order linear ODE. Its solution is $x^{1}(t) = C e^{t}$ for some constant $C$. Using the initial condition $x^{1}(0) = p^{1}$, we find $p^{1} = C e^{0}$, which implies $C=p^{1}$. Thus, the solution is:\n$$\nx^{1}(t) = p^{1}e^{t}\n$$\nThe remaining equations, $\\frac{dx^{i}}{dt} = 0$ for $i \\geq 2$, integrate to $x^{i}(t) = \\text{constant}$. Using the initial conditions $x^{i}(0) = p^{i}$, we find that the constant is $p^{i}$. Thus:\n$$\nx^{i}(t) = p^{i} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}\n$$\nThe flow $\\phi_{t}$ maps the starting point $p$ to the point on the integral curve at time $t$. Therefore, the flow is given by:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}(p^{1}, \\dots, p^{n}) = (p^{1}e^{t}, p^{2}, \\dots, p^{n})\n$$\nTo make the notation consistent with the problem statement, we use $x = (x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ as the arbitrary point in the manifold instead of $p$. The flow is $\\phi_{t}(x) = (x^{1}e^{t}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n})$.\n\nNow we can compute the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_{X}f$. We evaluate the function $f(x)=x^{1}x^{2}$ along the flow:\n$$\nf(\\phi_{t}(x)) = f(x^{1}e^{t}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n})\n$$\nAccording to the definition of $f$, this becomes:\n$$\nf(\\phi_{t}(x)) = (x^{1}e^{t})x^{2} = x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}\n$$\nNext, we differentiate this expression with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} f(\\phi_{t}(x)) = \\frac{d}{dt} (x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}) = x^{1}x^{2} \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{t}) = x^{1}x^{2}e^{t}\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{X}f)(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} f(\\phi_{t}(x)) = x^{1}x^{2}e^{0} = x^{1}x^{2}\n$$\nThus, the Lie derivative of $f(x)=x^{1}x^{2}$ along the vector field $X=x^{1}\\partial_{1}$ is the function $x^{1}x^{2}$.\n\nIt is useful to note that for a scalar function, the Lie derivative is equivalent to the directional derivative: $\\mathcal{L}_{X}f = X(f)$. We can verify our result using this alternative definition:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X}f = X(f) = (x^{1}\\partial_{1})(x^{1}x^{2}) = x^{1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}(x^{1}x^{2})\\right) = x^{1}(1 \\cdot x^{2}) = x^{1}x^{2}\n$$\nThe result is consistent.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation:**\nThe Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_{X}f$ at a point $x$ measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function $f$ as one moves away from $x$ along the integral curve of the vector field $X$. The integral curves of $X=x^{1}\\partial_{1}$ are trajectories where particles move parallel to the $x^1$-axis with a velocity proportional to their $x^1$-coordinate. Points on the hyperplane $x^{1}=0$ are fixed points. Points with $x^{1}>0$ move in the positive $x^{1}$ direction, and points with $x^{1}<0$ move in the negative $x^{1}$ direction, both accelerating away from the $x^{1}=0$ hyperplane.\n\nOur result, $\\mathcal{L}_{X}f = x^{1}x^{2}$, shows that the rate of change of the function $f$ along these flow lines is equal to the value of the function $f$ itself. This implies an exponential-like behavior for the value of $f$ along an integral curve. Let $g(t) = f(\\phi_{t}(x))$ be the value of $f$ along the flow line starting at $x$. We found that $\\frac{dg}{dt} \\Big|_{t=0} = (\\mathcal{L}_{X}f)(x) = f(x) = g(0)$. More generally, at any point $\\gamma(t) = \\phi_t(x)$ along the curve, the rate of change is $\\frac{dg}{dt} (t) = (\\mathcal{L}_X f)(\\gamma(t))$. In our case, $(\\mathcal{L}_X f)(\\gamma(t)) = (x^1e^t)(x^2) = f(\\gamma(t)) = g(t)$. So we have the differential equation $\\frac{dg}{dt} = g(t)$, whose solution is $g(t) = g(0) e^t$. This means the value of the function $f$ grows or decays exponentially along the flow lines of $X$, and the rate of this change at any point is simply the value of the function at that point.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^{1}x^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3056207"}, {"introduction": "We now extend the concept from scalar functions to differential forms, which are essential for tasks like integrating along curves and surfaces.

The problem requires using foundational relationships, namely Cartan's magic formula: $\\mathcal{L}_V \\omega = i_V(d\\omega) + d(i_V \\omega)$, where $i_V$ is the interior product (contraction) with respect to the vector field $V$.\nWe first compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n$$d\\alpha = d(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = d(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y) - d(y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = (\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) - (\\mathrm{d}y \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x) = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - (-\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = 2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$$\nNow, we compute $\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha$ using Cartan's formula with $V = Y = y\\,\\partial_y$.\nThe first term is $d(i_Y \\alpha)$:\n$$i_Y \\alpha = i_{y\\partial_y}(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}y) - y \\cdot i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot \\mathrm{d}y(y\\partial_y) - y \\cdot \\mathrm{d}x(y\\partial_y) = x \\cdot y - y \\cdot 0 = xy$$\nSo, $d(i_Y \\alpha) = d(xy) = y\\,\\mathrm{d}x + x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$.\nThe second term is $i_Y(d\\alpha)$:\n$$i_Y(d\\alpha) = i_{y\\partial_y}(2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = 2(i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}x) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge i_{y\\partial_y}(\\mathrm{d}y)) = 2(0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge y) = -2y\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$\nCombining the terms gives $\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha$:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha = d(i_Y \\alpha) + i_Y(d\\alpha) = (y\\,\\mathrm{d}x + x\\,\\mathrm{d}y) - 2y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\alpha$$\nNext, we compute $\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha$ using Cartan's formula with $V = X = x\\,\\partial_x$.\nThe first term is $d(i_X \\alpha)$:\n$$i_X \\alpha = i_{x\\partial_x}(x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}y) - y \\cdot i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}x) = x \\cdot 0 - y \\cdot x = -xy$$\nSo, $d(i_X \\alpha) = d(-xy) = -y\\,\\mathrm{d}x - x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$.\nThe second term is $i_X(d\\alpha)$:\n$$i_X(d\\alpha) = i_{x\\partial_x}(2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = 2(i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}x) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge i_{x\\partial_x}(\\mathrm{d}y)) = 2(x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge 0) = 2x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$$\nCombining the terms gives $\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha$:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = d(i_X \\alpha) + i_X(d\\alpha) = (-y\\,\\mathrm{d}x - x\\,\\mathrm{d}y) + 2x\\,\\mathrm{d}y = x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\alpha$$\nWe found that $\\mathcal{L}_X \\alpha = \\alpha$ and $\\mathcal{L}_Y \\alpha = \\alpha$. Now we can compute the commutator:\n$$(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\mathcal{L}_{Y} - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\mathcal{L}_{X})\\alpha = \\mathcal{L}_{X}(\\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\alpha) - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha) = \\mathcal{L}_{X}(\\alpha) - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}(\\alpha) = \\alpha - \\alpha = 0$$\nThe result is the zero $1$-form.\nThe connection to the previously computed Lie bracket is provided by the general identity for Lie derivatives: $[\\mathcal{L}_X, \\mathcal{L}_Y] = \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}$, where $[\\mathcal{L}_X, \\mathcal{L}_Y]$ is the commutator $\\mathcal{L}_X \\mathcal{L}_Y - \\mathcal{L}_Y \\mathcal{L}_X$.\nApplying this to our case:\n$$(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\mathcal{L}_{Y} - \\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\mathcal{L}_{X})\\alpha = \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}\\alpha$$\nSince we found $[X,Y]=0$, this becomes:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{0}\\alpha$$\nThe Lie derivative with respect to the zero vector field is always the zero operator. Using Cartan's formula, $\\mathcal{L}_0 = i_0 d + d i_0 = 0 + 0 = 0$. Thus, $\\mathcal{L}_0 \\alpha = 0$.\nOur explicit calculation, which yielded $0$, therefore serves as a verification of the general identity $[\\mathcal{L}_X, \\mathcal{L}_Y] = \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}$ for this specific case.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3056307"}]}
