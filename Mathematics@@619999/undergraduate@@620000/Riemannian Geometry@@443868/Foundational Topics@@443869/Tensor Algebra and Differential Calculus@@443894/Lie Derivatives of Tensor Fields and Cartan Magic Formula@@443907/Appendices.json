The given vector field $X$ and $1$-form $\\alpha$ are smooth on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The concepts of Lie derivatives, exterior derivatives, and interior products, along with Cartan's formula, are fundamental and well-defined principles in this field.

It does not violate any scientific principles, is not ill-posed, and contains no factual inaccuracies or contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem asks for the computation of the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha$ of the $1$-form $\\alpha$ with respect to the vector field $X$. The required method is Cartan's magic formula, which for a general $1$-form $\\alpha$ and a vector field $X$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha = d(i_{X}\\alpha) + i_{X}(d\\alpha)\n$$\nHere, $d$ represents the exterior derivative operator and $i_{X}$ represents the interior product (or contraction) with respect to $X$.\n\nWe will compute each term on the right-hand side separately.\n\nFirst, we compute the term $i_{X}\\alpha$. The interior product of a vector field $X$ and a $1$-form $\\alpha$ is a $0$-form (a scalar function) given by the evaluation of the form on the vector field, $i_{X}\\alpha = \\alpha(X)$.\nGiven $X = y\\,\\partial_{x} - x\\,\\partial_{y}$ and $\\alpha = x\\,dx + y\\,dy$, we have:\n$$\ni_{X}\\alpha = \\alpha(X) = (x\\,dx + y\\,dy)(y\\,\\partial_{x} - x\\,\\partial_{y})\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the forms and the fundamental property of the basis $1$-forms $dx, dy$ and basis vectors $\\partial_x, \\partial_y$, which is $dx^{i}(\\partial_{j}) = \\delta^{i}_{j}$ (the Kronecker delta), we expand the expression:\n$$\ni_{X}\\alpha = x\\,dx(y\\,\\partial_{x} - x\\,\\partial_{y}) + y\\,dy(y\\,\\partial_{x} - x\\,\\partial_{y})\n$$\n$$\ni_{X}\\alpha = x(y\\,dx(\\partial_{x}) - x\\,dx(\\partial_{y})) + y(y\\,dy(\\partial_{x}) - x\\,dy(\\partial_{y}))\n$$\nSince $dx(\\partial_{x})=1$, $dx(\\partial_{y})=0$, $dy(\\partial_{x})=0$, and $dy(\\partial_{y})=1$, we substitute these values:\n$$\ni_{X}\\alpha = x(y \\cdot 1 - x \\cdot 0) + y(y \\cdot 0 - x \\cdot 1) = xy - yx = 0\n$$\nSo, the interior product $i_{X}\\alpha$ is the zero function, which is a $0$-form.\n\nThe first term in Cartan's formula is $d(i_{X}\\alpha)$. Since $i_{X}\\alpha = 0$, we have:\n$$\nd(i_{X}\\alpha) = d(0) = 0\n$$\nThe exterior derivative of a constant function (a $0$-form) is always the zero $1$-form.\n\nNext, we compute the term $i_{X}(d\\alpha)$. This requires us to first find the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$, which is $d\\alpha$.\nGiven $\\alpha = x\\,dx + y\\,dy$, we apply the $d$ operator:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(x\\,dx + y\\,dy) = d(x\\,dx) + d(y\\,dy)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for exterior derivatives, $d(f\\omega) = df \\wedge \\omega + f\\,d\\omega$, where $f$ is a $0$-form and $\\omega$ is a $p$-form:\n$$\nd(x\\,dx) = (dx) \\wedge dx + x\\,d(dx)\n$$\n$$\nd(y\\,dy) = (dy) \\wedge dy + y\\,d(dy)\n$$\nThe exterior derivative of any exact form is zero ($d^2=0$), so $d(dx)=0$ and $d(dy)=0$. Also, the wedge product of any $1$-form with itself is zero, so $dx \\wedge dx = 0$ and $dy \\wedge dy = 0$. Therefore:\n$$\nd(x\\,dx)=0 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad d(y\\,dy)=0\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\nd\\alpha = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe result $d\\alpha=0$ indicates that the $1$-form $\\alpha$ is a closed form.\n\nThe second term in Cartan's formula is $i_{X}(d\\alpha)$. Since $d\\alpha=0$, we have:\n$$\ni_{X}(d\\alpha) = i_{X}(0) = 0\n$$\nThe interior product of any vector field with the zero form is the zero form.\n\nFinally, we substitute these results back into Cartan's magic formula:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha = d(i_{X}\\alpha) + i_{X}(d\\alpha) = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Lie derivative of $\\alpha$ with respect to $X$ is the zero $1$-form.\n\nThe problem also asks whether $\\alpha$ is invariant under the flow generated by $X$. A differential form $\\alpha$ is said to be invariant under the flow $\\phi_t$ of a vector field $X$ if its pullback along the flow, $\\phi_t^*\\alpha$, is equal to itself for all $t$. The infinitesimal criterion for this invariance is precisely that the Lie derivative of the form with respect to the vector field is zero. Since we have computed $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha = 0$, we conclude that the $1$-form $\\alpha$ is indeed invariant under the flow generated by the vector field $X$. The flow of $X$ corresponds to rotations about the origin, and the form $\\alpha = d(\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2))$ is related to the radial distance, which is manifestly invariant under rotations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3056292"}, {"introduction": "While Cartan's formula is tailored for differential forms, the concept of the Lie derivative applies to any tensor field.
