The space of alternating $n$-linear forms on an $n$-dimensional real vector space is one-dimensional, so any two such forms that agree on a single ordered basis must agree everywhere.

The change of variables formula for differential forms states that for a coordinate transformation $\\Phi$, the pullback of the volume form is related to the original form by the Jacobian determinant of the transformation.

At any point $p \\in S^2$, the outward unit normal is $N_p = p$.

The matrix $A$ is orthogonal, as $A^T A = I$, so $A^T=A^{-1}$. In this case, $A^T=A$, so $A^2=I$. The calculation is $(Av) \\cdot (Ap) = v^T A^T A p = v^T I p = v^T p = v \\cdot p = 0$. Thus, $dF_p(v) \\in T_{F(p)}S^2$.\n\nFurthermore, since $A^T A = I$, the map $F$ is an isometry.
