The concepts are standard in differential geometry.\n\nThe task is to compute the value of $(i_{X}\\omega)_{p}(\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z})$ at the point $p = (0,0,0,0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$. Here, $i_{X}\\omega$ is the interior product (or contraction) of the $3$-form $\\omega$ by the vector field $X$. The result of this operation is a $2$-form. We are asked to evaluate this $2$-form on the pair of tangent vectors $(\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z})$ at the point $p$.\n\nThe fundamental definition of the interior product of a $k$-form $\\alpha$ with a vector field $X$ is a $(k-1)$-form $i_X\\alpha$ whose value at any point $q$ is given by:\n$$ (i_{X}\\alpha)_{q}(V_{1}, \\dots, V_{k-1}) = \\alpha_{q}(X(q), V_{1}, \\dots, V_{k-1}) $$\nfor any tangent vectors $V_{1}, \\dots, V_{k-1} \\in T_{q}M$. This definition shows that the operation is pointwise: to compute the resulting form at a point $q$, one only needs the value of the vector field $X(q)$ and the value of the form $\\alpha_q$ at that specific point.\n\nIn our case, $\\alpha = \\omega$ is a $3$-form, so $i_X\\omega$ is a $2$-form. The point of evaluation is $p=(0,0,0,0)$. The tangent vectors are $V_1 = \\partial_y$ and $V_2 = \\partial_z$. Applying the definition, we have:\n$$ (i_{X}\\omega)_{p}(\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}) = \\omega_{p}(X(p), \\partial_{y}|_p, \\partial_{z}|_p) $$\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of the vector field $X$ at the point $p = (0,0,0,0)$.

This means that if any one of its arguments is the zero vector, the entire expression evaluates to zero. Since the first argument is $X(p) = \\vec{0}_{p}$, the result is $0$.\nExplicitly, for any $k$-form $\\alpha$ and vectors $V_1, \\dots, V_k$:\n$$ \\alpha(\\dots, cV_{i}, \\dots) = c \\cdot \\alpha(\\dots, V_{i}, \\dots) $$\nSetting the constant $c=0$, we have:\n$$ \\alpha(\\dots, \\vec{0}, \\dots) = 0 \\cdot \\alpha(\\dots, V_{i}, \\dots) = 0 $$\nTherefore,\n$$ (i_{X}\\omega)_{p}(\\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}) = \\omega_{p}(\\vec{0}_{p}, \\partial_{y}|_p, \\partial_{z}|_p) = 0 $$\n\nThe problem also asks to briefly justify why the computed value verifies that the interior product at a point depends only on the value $X(p)$ and not on any derivatives of $X$ at $p$.\nThe justification is inherent in the calculation performed. The definition $(i_{X}\\omega)_{p}(V_1, \\dots) = \\omega_{p}(X(p), V_1, \\dots)$ shows that the computation of $(i_X\\omega)_p$ only requires the input $X(p)$, which is the vector value of $X$ at the single point $p$. It does not involve any information about the behavior of $X$ in a neighborhood of $p$, such as its derivatives $\\frac{\\partial X^i}{\\partial x^j}$.\nOur calculation explicitly demonstrates this. We computed $X(p) = \\vec{0}_p$ and used only this value. The functions $x^2$, $y$, $-zt$, and $\\sin(t)$ that define $X$ away from $p$ did not enter the final calculation. If we had a different vector field, say $Y = x \\partial_x + y^3 \\partial_y$, we would find that $Y(p) = \\vec{0}_p$ as well. The calculation of $(i_Y\\omega)_p(\\partial_y, \\partial_z)$ would yield the exact same result of $0$, even though the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ and their derivatives are different in any neighborhood of $p$.
