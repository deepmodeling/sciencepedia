The corresponding tensor space is\n$$\nT^{2}_{1}(V) = V \\otimes V \\otimes V^{*}\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the dimension of this space. The problem provides two key facts:\n1. For a finite-dimensional vector space $W$, its dual space $W^*$ has the same dimension, i.e., $\\dim(W^*) = \\dim(W)$.\n2. The dimension of the tensor product of two finite-dimensional vector spaces $U$ and $W$ is the product of their individual dimensions, i.e., $\\dim(U \\otimes W) = \\dim(U) \\dim(W)$.\n\nThis second property extends by associativity to the tensor product of any finite number of vector spaces. For $T^{2}_{1}(V) = V \\otimes V \\otimes V^{*}$, its dimension is given by:\n$$\n\\dim(T^{2}_{1}(V)) = \\dim(V \\otimes V \\otimes V^{*}) = \\dim(V) \\cdot \\dim(V) \\cdot \\dim(V^{*})\n$$\nWe are given that $\\dim(V) = n = 3$.

We are given a basis $\\{e_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{3}$ for $V$ and its corresponding dual basis $\\{\\varepsilon^{i}\\}_{i=1}^{3}$ for $V^{*}$. The dual basis is defined by the property $\\varepsilon^{j}(e_{i}) = \\delta^{j}_{i}$, where $\\delta^{j}_{i}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nA fundamental property of the tensor product is that if $\\{u_{\\alpha}\\}$ is a basis for a vector space $U$ and $\\{w_{\\beta}\\}$ is a basis for a vector space $W$, then the set of all tensor products $\\{u_{\\alpha} \\otimes w_{\\beta}\\}$ forms a basis for the tensor product space $U \\otimes W$.\n\nWe apply this principle to the space $T^{2}_{1}(V) = V \\otimes V \\otimes V^{*}$. The basis for the first $V$ factor is $\\{e_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{3}$. The basis for the second $V$ factor is also $\\{e_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{3}$. The basis for the $V^*$ factor is $\\{\\varepsilon^{k}\\}_{k=1}^{3}$.\nTherefore, a basis for $T^{2}_{1}(V)$ is formed by taking all possible tensor products of the basis vectors from each of the three constituent spaces. The basis elements are of the form $e_{i} \\otimes e_{j} \\otimes \\varepsilon^{k}$.\n\nThe indices $i$, $j$, and $k$ each range over the dimension of their respective spaces.
