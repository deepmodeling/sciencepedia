It is a standard, well-posed problem in multilinear algebra and its application to geometry. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Part 1: Theoretical Derivation\n\nLet $L: V \\to V$ be a linear map on an $n$-dimensional real vector space $V$. This map induces a linear map on the $n$-th exterior power of $V$, denoted $L_*: \\Lambda^n V \\to \\Lambda^n V$ (or $\\Lambda^n L$). The action of $L_*$ on a simple $n$-vector $v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n$ is defined as:\n$$L_*(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n) = L(v_1) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge L(v_n)$$\nThe vector space $\\Lambda^n V$ has dimension $\\binom{n}{n} = 1$. Any linear map from a one-dimensional vector space to itself must be multiplication by a scalar. Let this scalar be $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, for any $\\alpha \\in \\Lambda^n V$, we have $L_*(\\alpha) = c \\alpha$.\n\nTo determine the scalar $c$, we choose a basis $(e_1, \\dots, e_n)$ for $V$. The element $e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n$ is a basis vector for $\\Lambda^n V$. Let $M$ be the matrix representation of $L$ with respect to this basis, such that $L(e_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^n M_{ij} e_i$. We compute the action of $L_*$ on this basis vector:\n$$L_*(e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n) = L(e_1) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge L(e_n) = \\left(\\sum_{i_1=1}^n M_{i_1 1} e_{i_1}\\right) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\left(\\sum_{i_n=1}^n M_{i_n n} e_{i_n}\\right)$$\nBy the multilinearity of the wedge product, this becomes:\n$$L_*(e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n) = \\sum_{i_1, \\dots, i_n = 1}^n M_{i_1 1} \\cdots M_{i_n n} (e_{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_{i_n})$$\nThe term $e_{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_{i_n}$ is non-zero only if the indices $(i_1, \\dots, i_n)$ form a permutation of $(1, \\dots, n)$. If $\\sigma \\in S_n$ is such a permutation, where $i_j = \\sigma(j)$, then $e_{\\sigma(1)} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_{\\sigma(n)} = \\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma) (e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n)$, where $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma)$ is the sign of the permutation. The sum simplifies to:\n$$L_*(e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n) = \\left( \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma) M_{\\sigma(1) 1} \\cdots M_{\\sigma(n) n} \\right) (e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n)$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is the Leibniz formula for the determinant of the matrix $M$. The determinant of a linear operator is independent of the choice of basis, so we write $\\det(M) = \\det(L)$. Thus,\n$$L_*(e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n) = \\det(L) (e_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e_n)$$\nThis shows that the scalar $c$ is the determinant of $L$. So, the action of $L$ on $\\Lambda^n V$ is multiplication by $\\det(L)$.\n\nNext, we relate this to the oriented volume. An $n$-form $\\omega \\in \\Lambda^n V^*$ is a linear functional on $\\Lambda^n V$. The oriented volume of a parallelepiped spanned by $(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ is $\\omega(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$, which can be written as $\\omega(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n)$. The oriented volume of the image of this parallelepiped under $L$ is $\\omega(L(v_1), \\dots, L(v_n))$. We can express this as:\n$$\\omega(L(v_1), \\dots, L(v_n)) = \\omega(L(v_1) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge L(v_n)) = \\omega(L_*(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n))$$\nUsing our result that $L_*$ is multiplication by $\\det(L)$:\n$$\\omega(L_*(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n)) = \\omega(\\det(L) (v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n))$$\nBy the linearity of $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega(\\det(L) (v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n)) = \\det(L) \\, \\omega(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n)$$\nThis identity confirms that the oriented-volume scaling factor is precisely $\\det(L)$.\n\nFinally, we consider an orientation-preserving map $L$. If $(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ is a positively oriented basis, then by definition $\\omega(v_1, \\dots, v_n) > 0$. Since $L$ is orientation-preserving, the image basis $(L(v_1), \\dots, L(v_n))$ must also be positively oriented, which means $\\omega(L(v_1), \\dots, L(v_n)) > 0$. Using the scaling relation:\n$$\\det(L) \\, \\omega(v_1, \\dots, v_n) > 0$$\nSince $\\omega(v_1, \\dots, v_n) > 0$, this inequality can only hold if $\\det(L) > 0$. Thus, a map is orientation-preserving if and only if its determinant is positive. This implies that such a map preserves the sign of any oriented volume, since the volume is simply scaled by a positive number.\n\n### Part 2: Application to the Specific Case\n\nWe are given $V = \\mathbb{R}^3$ with its standard orientation, determined by the volume form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. The standard basis is $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$, where $e_1=(1,0,0)$, $e_2=(0,1,0)$, and $e_3=(0,0,1)$. The unit cube $[0,1]^3$ is the parallelepiped spanned by these three vectors. The oriented volume of the unit cube is:\n$$\\text{Volume} = \\omega(e_1, e_2, e_3) = (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz)(e_1, e_2, e_3) = 1$$\nThe linear map $A: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ is represented by the matrix:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe image of the unit cube under $A$ is the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors $A(e_1)$, $A(e_2)$, and $A(e_3)$. These are the column vectors of the matrix $A$. The oriented volume of this image is given by $\\omega(A(e_1), A(e_2), A(e_3))$.\n\nBased on the theoretical derivation, this volume is:\n$$\\omega(A(e_1), A(e_2), A(e_3)) = \\det(A) \\, \\omega(e_1, e_2, e_3)$$\nSince $\\omega(e_1, e_2, e_3) = 1$, the oriented volume of the image is simply $\\det(A)$. We compute the determinant of the matrix $A$:\n$$\\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + 0 \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix}$$\n$$\\det(A) = 2((3)(2) - (1)(0)) + 1((0)(2) - (1)(1)) + 0$$\n$$\\det(A) = 2(6) + 1(-1) = 12 - 1 = 11$$\nThe oriented volume of the image of the unit cube under the map $A$ is $11$.

It provides a specific smooth map $f$, defines the context of standard orientation on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, and provides the standard criterion for a map to be orientation-preserving at a point (the sign of the determinant of its differential). The functions used, $\\arctan(x)$ and $\\tanh(y)$, are standard elementary functions whose properties are well-established. The task is to apply these definitions and compute a result. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution**\n\nAn orientation on a finite-dimensional real vector space $V$ is a choice of equivalence class of ordered bases. Two ordered bases $(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ and $(w_1, \\dots, w_n)$ are in the same equivalence class if the change-of-basis matrix from one to the other has a positive determinant. The standard orientation on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the one represented by the standard basis $(e_1, \\dots, e_n)$.\n\nA smooth map $f: M \\to N$ between two oriented $n$-dimensional manifolds is said to be orientation-preserving at a point $p \\in M$ if its differential, the linear map $Df_p : T_p M \\to T_{f(p)} N$, maps an oriented basis of the tangent space $T_p M$ to an oriented basis of $T_{f(p)} N$. For the case $M = \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $N = \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with their standard orientations, this condition is equivalent to the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at $p$ being positive. The map $f$ is globally orientation-preserving if it is orientation-preserving at every point $p$ in its domain.\n\nThe given map is $f:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by\n$$\nf(x,y,z)=\\big(x+\\arctan(x),\\ y+\\tanh(y),\\ z+\\arctan(z)\\big).\n$$\nLet the components of $f$ be $f_1(x,y,z) = x+\\arctan(x)$, $f_2(x,y,z) = y+\\tanh(y)$, and $f_3(x,y,z) = z+\\arctan(z)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Jacobian matrix $Df_{(x,y,z)}$. The entries of this matrix are the partial derivatives of the component functions of $f$.\n$$\nDf_{(x,y,z)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d}{dx}(x+\\arctan(x)) = 1 + \\frac{1}{1+x^2}$. Since $f_1$ depends only on $x$, $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = \\frac{d}{dy}(y+\\tanh(y)) = 1 + \\text{sech}^2(y) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(y)}$. Since $f_2$ depends only on $y$, $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z} = \\frac{d}{dz}(z+\\arctan(z)) = 1 + \\frac{1}{1+z^2}$. Since $f_3$ depends only on $z$, $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the matrix, we obtain the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at a point $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$:\n$$\nDf_{(x,y,z)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + \\frac{1}{1+x^2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 + \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(y)} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 + \\frac{1}{1+z^2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we determine the determinant of this matrix. Since $Df_{(x,y,z)}$ is a diagonal matrix, its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries.\n$$\n\\det(Df_{(x,y,z)}) = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(y)}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1+z^2}\\right)\n$$\nTo determine if $f$ is globally orientation-preserving, we must analyze the sign of this determinant for all $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We examine each factor in the product.\n\nFor the first factor, $1 + \\frac{1}{1+x^2}$: For any real number $x$, we have $x^2 \\ge 0$. This implies $1+x^2 \\ge 1$. Consequently, $0 < \\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\le 1$. Therefore, the entire factor is strictly positive: $1 < 1 + \\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\le 2$.\n\nFor the second factor, $1 + \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(y)}$: For any real number $y$, the hyperbolic cosine function $\\cosh(y) = \\frac{\\exp(y)+\\exp(-y)}{2}$ satisfies $\\cosh(y) \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\cosh^2(y) \\ge 1$, which implies $0 < \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(y)} \\le 1$. The entire factor is therefore strictly positive: $1 < 1 + \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(y)} \\le 2$.\n\nFor the third factor, $1 + \\frac{1}{1+z^2}$: This term is analogous to the first. For any real number $z$, $z^2 \\ge 0$, which leads to $1 < 1 + \\frac{1}{1+z^2} \\le 2$. This factor is also strictly positive.\n\nThe determinant $\\det(Df_{(x,y,z)})$ is the product of three strictly positive quantities. The product of positive numbers is always positive. Specifically, we have $\\det(Df_{(x,y,z)}) > 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nSince $\\det(Df_{(x,y,z)}) > 0$ for all points $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the map $f$ preserves the orientation at every point in its domain. The set of points where the determinant is positive is the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The set of points where it is negative is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, the map $f$ is globally orientation-preserving.

Let $g\\colon \\mathbb{R}\\times(-1,1) \\to \\mathbb{R}\\times(-1,1)$ be the map $g(x,y) = (x+1, -y)$. The group $G$ consists of all integer powers of $g$, $G = \\{g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The Möbius strip is then the quotient manifold $M = (\\mathbb{R}\\times(-1,1))/G$. The quotient map is $\\pi\\colon \\mathbb{R}\\times(-1,1) \\to M$.\n\nIn this model, the core loop $c$ is the image of the path $\\tilde{c}\\colon [0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}\\times(-1,1)$ given by $\\tilde{c}(t) = (t,0)$. Note that $\\pi(\\tilde{c}(0)) = \\pi(0,0)$ and $\\pi(\\tilde{c}(1)) = \\pi(1,0)$.

Since $\\mathbb{R}\\times(-1,1)$ is a flat space (a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$), parallel transport along any path is simply the standard identification of tangent spaces.\n\nLet us pick a basis for the tangent space at the starting point of the loop, $c(0)=\\pi(0,0)$. A basis for $T_{c(0)}M$ is given by the image of the basis $\\{\\partial_x|_{(0,0)}, \\partial_y|_{(0,0)}\\}$ under the differential of the projection map, $d\\pi_{(0,0)}$.

Specifically, $dg_{(0,0)}(\\partial_x|_{(0,0)}) = \\partial_x|_{(1,0)}$ and $dg_{(0,0)}(\\partial_y|_{(0,0)}) = -\\partial_y|_{(1,0)}$.\n\nNow we can express the initial basis vectors $v_1, v_2$ in terms of the final ones $w_1, w_2$:\n$v_1 = d\\pi_{(0,0)}(\\partial_x|_{(0,0)}) = (d\\pi_{(1,0)}\\circ dg_{(0,0)})(\\partial_x|_{(0,0)}) = d\\pi_{(1,0)}(\\partial_x|_{(1,0)}) = w_1$.\n$v_2 = d\\pi_{(0,0)}(\\partial_y|_{(0,0)}) = (d\\pi_{(1,0)}\\circ dg_{(0,0)})(\\partial_y|_{(0,0)}) = d\\pi_{(1,0)}(-\\partial_y|_{(1,0)}) = -w_2$.\n\nSo, the initial basis was $(v_1, v_2)$, and the transported basis is $(w_1, w_2) = (v_1, -v_2)$. The change-of-basis matrix from the initial basis to the transported basis is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant of this matrix is $-1$.\n\nThe orientation is therefore reversed. The pairing $\\langle w_{1}(TM),[c]\\rangle$ is the value of this determinant in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$:\n$$\n\\langle w_{1}(TM),[c]\\rangle = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\pmod 2 = -1 \\pmod 2 = 1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}.\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Obstruction to Existence of a Nowhere-Vanishing Smooth 2-Form**\n\nWe need to explain why a nonzero $w_{1}(TM)$ obstructs the existence of a global nowhere-vanishing smooth $2$-form on $M$.\n\nA foundational result in differential geometry states that an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold is orientable if and only if it admits a global, smooth, nowhere-vanishing $n$-form. Such a form is called a volume form. For our $2$-dimensional Möbius strip $M$, this means $M$ is orientable if and only if there exists a smooth $2$-form $\\omega$ on $M$ such that $\\omega_p \\neq 0$ for all $p \\in M$.\n\nThe connection between orientability and the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_{1}(TM)$ is definitional.\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- A smooth manifold is orientable if and only if its tangent bundle $TM$ admits a reduction of its structure group from $\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ to its subgroup of orientation-preserving transformations, $\\mathrm{GL}^{+}(n,\\mathbb{R})$. This means there exists an atlas of charts $\\{(U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\}$ such that for any two overlapping charts, the Jacobian determinant of the transition map, $\\det(d(\\phi_\\beta \\circ \\phi_\\alpha^{-1}))$, is positive everywhere on the overlap.\n- The first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_{1}(TM) \\in H^{1}(M;\\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ is the cohomology class of the Čech $1$-cocycle $\\{w_{\\alpha\\beta}\\}$ defined with respect to an atlas $\\{(U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\}$. The component $w_{\\alpha\\beta} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is $0$ if $\\det(d(\\phi_\\beta \\circ \\phi_\\alpha^{-1}))>0$ and $1$ if $\\det(d(\\phi_\\beta \\circ \\phi_\\alpha^{-1}))<0$.\n\nCombining these definitions, we can establish the following equivalence:\nA manifold $M$ is orientable if and only if $w_{1}(TM)=0$.\n\nProof of the equivalence:\n($\\Rightarrow$) If $M$ is orientable, there exists an atlas for which all transition Jacobians have positive determinants. For this atlas, the corresponding Čech cocycle $\\{w_{\\alpha\\beta}\\}$ is identically $0$. A zero cocycle represents the zero cohomology class, so $w_{1}(TM) = 0$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) If $w_{1}(TM)=0$, then for any atlas, the corresponding cocycle $\\{w_{\\alpha\\beta}\\}$ is a coboundary. This means there exists a $0$-cochain $\\{c_\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2\\}$ such that $w_{\\alpha\\beta} = c_\\alpha + c_\\beta \\pmod 2$. We can use this $0$-cochain to modify the charts $\\phi_\\alpha$ to a new set of charts $\\phi'_\\alpha$. If $c_\\alpha=1$, we compose $\\phi_\\alpha$ with an orientation-reversing map (e.g., flipping the sign of one coordinate); if $c_\\alpha=0$, we do nothing. The new transition maps will have Jacobians whose signs give a new cocycle $w'_{\\alpha\\beta} = w_{\\alpha\\beta} + c_\\alpha + c_\\beta = (c_\\alpha+c_\\beta) + (c_\\alpha+c_\\beta) = 0 \\pmod 2$. Since the new cocycle is identically zero, all transition Jacobians are positive, which means the manifold is orientable.\n\nTherefore, the condition $w_{1}(TM) \\neq 0$ is equivalent to the statement that $M$ is non-orientable. Since a manifold admits a global nowhere-vanishing smooth top-degree form if and only if it is orientable, a non-zero $w_{1}(TM)$ is precisely the obstruction to the existence of such a form.\n\nFor the Möbius strip $M$, we computed in Part 1 that $\\langle w_{1}(TM),[c]\\rangle = 1$. This implies that the cohomology class $w_{1}(TM)$ is non-zero. Consequently, the Möbius strip is non-orientable and does not admit a global, smooth, nowhere-vanishing $2$-form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3061057"}]}
