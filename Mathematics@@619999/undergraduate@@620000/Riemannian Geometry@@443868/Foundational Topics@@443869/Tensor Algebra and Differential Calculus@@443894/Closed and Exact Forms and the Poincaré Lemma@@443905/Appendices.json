In our case, $\\omega$ is a $1$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nThe given $1$-form is $\\omega = 2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy$.\nWe can write this in the general form $\\omega = P(x,y)\\,dx + Q(x,y)\\,dy$, where $P(x,y) = 2x$ and $Q(x,y) = 2y$.\n\nThe exterior derivative of a $1$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a $2$-form given by the formula:\n$$d\\omega = d(P\\,dx + Q\\,dy) = (dP) \\wedge dx + (dQ) \\wedge dy$$\nUsing the definition of the exterior derivative of a $0$-form (a function), we have:\n$$dP = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}dy$$\n$$dQ = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y}dy$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\omega$ and using the anticommutative property of the wedge product ($dx \\wedge dx = 0$, $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, and $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$):\n$$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}dy\\right) \\wedge dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y}dy\\right) \\wedge dy$$\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}(dx \\wedge dx) + \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}(dy \\wedge dx) + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}(dx \\wedge dy) + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y}(dy \\wedge dy)$$\n$$d\\omega = 0 - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}(dx \\wedge dy) + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}(dx \\wedge dy) + 0$$\n$$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy$$\nNow we compute the partial derivatives for our specific form:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2y) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2x) = 0$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n$$d\\omega = (0 - 0) dx \\wedge dy = 0$$\nSince $d\\omega = 0$, the differential form $\\omega$ is closed.\n\n**Part 2: Find the potential function $F(x,y)$**\n\nSince $\\omega$ is a closed form on the simply connected domain $M=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the Poincaré lemma guarantees that it is also exact. This means there exists a smooth function (a $0$-form) $F(x,y)$ such that its exterior derivative $dF$ is equal to $\\omega$.\nThe exterior derivative of $F$ is given by:\n$$dF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}dy$$\nWe are given $dF = \\omega$, so we must have:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}dy = 2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of $dx$ and $dy$, we obtain a system of partial differential equations:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nWe can solve this system by integrating the first equation with respect to $x$, holding $y$ constant:\n$$F(x,y) = \\int \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} dx = \\int 2x \\, dx = x^2 + g(y)$$\nHere, $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$, which acts as the \"constant of integration\" with respect to $x$.\n\nNext, we differentiate this expression for $F(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ and equate it to the second equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + g(y)) = 0 + g'(y)$$\nFrom equation (2), we know $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$. Therefore:\n$$g'(y) = 2y$$\nWe integrate this with respect to $y$ to find $g(y)$:\n$$g(y) = \\int 2y \\, dy = y^2 + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $g(y)$ back into our equation for $F(x,y)$, we get the general form of the potential function:\n$$F(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + C$$\nThe problem specifies the condition $F(0,0) = 0$. We apply this to find the value of $C$:\n$$F(0,0) = 0^2 + 0^2 + C = 0$$\nThis implies $C=0$.\nThus, the specific function $F(x,y)$ that satisfies the given conditions is:\n$$F(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$$\n\n**Part 3: Verify the result**\n\nWe must verify that for our candidate function $F(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, its exterior derivative $dF$ is indeed equal to $\\omega$.\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $F$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + y^2) = 2x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + y^2) = 2y$$\nThe exterior derivative is then:\n$$dF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}dy = 2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy$$\nThis is precisely the original $1$-form $\\omega$.

We shall proceed by following the steps laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe two-torus is defined as the quotient manifold $T^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2/\\mathbb{Z}^2$, where the group $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ acts on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by translations: $(m,n) \\cdot (u,v) = (u+m, v+n)$ for $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The quotient map is $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$.\n\n**1. Construction of the 2-form $\\omega$**\n\nWe begin by defining a differential form on the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $(u,v)$ be the standard coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We are asked to consider a constant-coefficient $2$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let us define the $2$-form $\\Omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by:\n$$\n\\Omega = du \\wedge dv\n$$\nThis is a $2$-form with the constant coefficient $1$.\n\nFor $\\Omega$ to descend to a well-defined $2$-form $\\omega$ on the quotient manifold $T^2$, it must be invariant under the action of the group $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The action on points is given by the translation maps $T_{m,n}(u, v) = (u+m, v+n)$ for any $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$. We must verify that the pullback of $\\Omega$ under any such translation is $\\Omega$ itself, i.e., $T_{m,n}^* \\Omega = \\Omega$.\n\nLet $(u', v') = T_{m,n}(u, v) = (u+m, v+n)$. The differentials are $du' = d(u+m) = du$ and $dv' = d(v+n) = dv$. The pullback of the form $\\Omega' = du' \\wedge dv'$ (which is the same form as $\\Omega$ but expressed in the new coordinates) is:\n$$\nT_{m,n}^* (du' \\wedge dv') = d(u' \\circ T_{m,n}) \\wedge d(v' \\circ T_{m,n}) = d(u+m) \\wedge d(v+n) = du \\wedge dv = \\Omega\n$$\nSince $\\Omega$ is invariant under all translations by elements of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, it descends to a unique, well-defined, smooth $2$-form $\\omega$ on $T^2$. This form $\\omega$ is defined by the property that its pullback to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ via the quotient map $\\pi$ is $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\pi^* \\omega = \\Omega = du \\wedge dv\n$$\n\n**2. Justification that $\\omega$ is closed**\n\nA differential form is defined as closed if its exterior derivative is zero. We need to show that $d\\omega = 0$. We will use the property that the exterior derivative operator $d$ commutes with pullback maps (naturality). For our quotient map $\\pi$, this means $d(\\pi^* \\omega) = \\pi^*(d\\omega)$.\n\nLet's compute the exterior derivative of $\\Omega = \\pi^*\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\Omega = d(du \\wedge dv)\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative, we have:\n$$\nd(du \\wedge dv) = d(du) \\wedge dv - du \\wedge d(dv)\n$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that $d^2 = 0$. Applying this, we get $d(du) = 0$ and $d(dv) = 0$. Therefore,\n$$\nd\\Omega = 0 \\wedge dv - du \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nNow, using the naturality property:\n$$\n\\pi^*(d\\omega) = d(\\pi^*\\omega) = d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nThe map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ is a surjective local diffeomorphism. Its associated pullback map $\\pi^*$ on differential forms is injective. An injective map sends a non-zero element to a non-zero element, so if $\\pi^*(\\alpha) = 0$, it must be that $\\alpha = 0$. Applying this to our situation, since $\\pi^*(d\\omega) = 0$, we conclude that $d\\omega = 0$. Thus, the form $\\omega$ is closed.\n\n**3. Proof that $\\omega$ is not exact**\n\nA differential form is defined as exact if it is the exterior derivative of another differential form. To prove that $\\omega$ is not exact, we will argue by contradiction, using Stokes' Theorem.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\omega$ is an exact form. By definition, this means there exists a smooth $1$-form $\\alpha$ on $T^2$ such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$.\n\nThe two-torus $T^2$ is a compact, oriented manifold without boundary. The boundary of $T^2$, denoted $\\partial T^2$, is the empty set: $\\partial T^2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nStokes' Theorem states that for any smooth $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$ on an oriented $k$-dimensional manifold with boundary $M$, we have $\\int_M d\\eta = \\int_{\\partial M} \\eta$.\nLet's apply this theorem to our situation with $M=T^2$, $k=2$, and our form $\\omega = d\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = \\int_{T^2} d\\alpha\n$$\nAccording to Stokes' Theorem, this is equal to the integral of $\\alpha$ over the boundary of $T^2$:\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial T^2} \\alpha\n$$\nSince $\\partial T^2 = \\emptyset$, the integral over the empty set is zero:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial T^2} \\alpha = 0\n$$\nTherefore, if $\\omega$ were an exact form, its integral over the entire manifold $T^2$ would have to be zero.\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = 0\n$$\nTo complete the proof by contradiction, we must show that this integral is, in fact, non-zero. This is the object of the final part of the problem.\n\n**4. Computation of the integral $\\int_{T^2} \\omega$**\n\nTo compute the integral $\\int_{T^2} \\omega$, we can lift the integral to the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and integrate over a fundamental domain. A fundamental domain for the action of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the unit square $D = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nThe integral of $\\omega$ over $T^2$ is equal to the integral of its pullback $\\pi^*\\omega = \\Omega$ over the fundamental domain $D$:\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = \\int_{D} \\pi^* \\omega = \\int_{[0,1]\\times[0,1]} du \\wedge dv\n$$\nThe orientation on $T^2$ is induced by the standard ordered basis $(\\partial_u, \\partial_v)$, which corresponds to the orientation of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ given by the form $du \\wedge dv$. The integral is computed as a standard double integral over the unit square:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, du \\, dv = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ u \\right]_{u=0}^{u=1} dv = \\int_{0}^{1} (1-0) \\, dv = \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, dv = \\left[ v \\right]_{v=0}^{v=1} = 1-0=1\n$$\nSo, we find that:\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = 1\n$$\nSince $\\int_{T^2} \\omega = 1 \\neq 0$, our assumption in step 3 must be false. Therefore, $\\omega$ cannot be an exact form.\n\nIn summary, we have constructed a smooth $2$-form $\\omega$ on $T^2$ that is closed ($d\\omega=0$) but not exact, and we have computed its integral to be $1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "3041257"}, {"introduction": "Our first exercise demonstrated a method for finding a primitive by integration on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.
