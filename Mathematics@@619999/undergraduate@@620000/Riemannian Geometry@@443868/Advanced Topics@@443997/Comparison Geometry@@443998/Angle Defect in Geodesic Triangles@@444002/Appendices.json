The angle defect is defined as $\\Delta(T) = \\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma-\\pi$, where $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are the interior angles of the triangle.\n\nA fundamental result in Riemannian geometry, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, directly relates the angle defect of a geodesic triangle to the integral of the Gaussian curvature $K$ over the area of the triangle. For a geodesic triangle $T$ on a $2$-dimensional manifold, the theorem states:\n$$ \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma - \\pi = \\iint_T K \\, dA $$\nwhere $dA$ is the area element on the manifold. Our task is thus to evaluate the integral on the right-hand side to leading order in the small parameters $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe evaluation proceeds in several steps:\n1.  Relate the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the area element $dA$ to the metric tensor $g_{ij}$.\n2.  Use the given Taylor expansion of $g_{ij}$ in normal coordinates to find expressions for $K$ and $dA$ near the point $p$.\n3.  Approximate the integral over the small geodesic triangle $T$.\n\nLet $(x^1, x^2)$ be the normal coordinates centered at $p$. The vertices of the triangle are $p$ at $(0,0)$, $q$ at $(a,0)$, and $r$ at $(0,b)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Gaussian curvature $K(p)$ in terms of the Riemann tensor components at $p$. The general formula for the Riemann tensor in $2$ dimensions is $R_{ikjl} = K(g_{il}g_{kj} - g_{ij}g_{kl})$. In the normal coordinates at $p$, we have $g_{ij}(p) = \\delta_{ij}$. Evaluating the component $R_{1212}$ at $p$ gives:\n$$ R_{1212}(p) = K(p) \\left( g_{11}(p)g_{22}(p) - g_{12}(p)g_{21}(p) \\right) = K(p) \\left( \\delta_{11}\\delta_{22} - \\delta_{12}\\delta_{21} \\right) = K(p)(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0) = K(p) $$\n\nNext, we find the area element $dA$.

Thus, $g_{12}(x) = O(|x|^3)$.\n\nThe determinant of the metric is:\n$$ \\det(g(x)) = g_{11}(x)g_{22}(x) - (g_{12}(x))^2 $$\n$$ \\det(g(x)) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}K(p)(x^2)^2\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}K(p)(x^1)^2\\right) + O(|x|^4) $$\n$$ \\det(g(x)) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3}K(p)\\left((x^1)^2 + (x^2)^2\\right) + O(|x|^4) $$\nThe square root is found using the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+u} \\approx 1 + u/2$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\det(g(x))} = 1 - \\frac{1}{6}K(p)\\left((x^1)^2 + (x^2)^2\\right) + O(|x|^4) $$\n\nNow we can write the integral for the angle defect:\n$$ \\Delta(T) = \\iint_T K(x) \\sqrt{\\det(g(x))} \\, dx^1 dx^2 $$\nThe integration is over the region $T$ bounded by the geodesics connecting $p,q,r$. Since $a$ and $b$ are small, the triangle is small and located near $p$. We can make the following approximations for the leading-order calculation:\n1.  The curvature $K(x)$ can be approximated by its value at $p$, i.e., $K(x) \\approx K(p)$. The correction is of order $|x|$, which, when integrated, will lead to higher-order terms in $a$ and $b$.\n2.  The area element factor $\\sqrt{\\det(g(x))}$ can be approximated by $1$. The correction is of order $|x|^2$, which also leads to higher-order terms in the final result.\n3.  The domain of integration, which is the geodesic triangle $T$, can be approximated by the Euclidean triangle $T_E$ in the coordinate plane with vertices $(0,0)$, $(a,0)$, and $(0,b)$. This is because in normal coordinates the geodesics through the origin $p$ are the coordinate axes, so two sides of $T$ are straight line segments. The third side, the geodesic from $q$ to $r$, deviates from a straight line by an amount that is of higher order in $a$ and $b$, and the resulting correction to the area of integration is also of higher order.\n\nCombining these approximations, we evaluate the integral to leading order:\n$$ \\Delta(T) \\approx \\iint_{T_E} K(p) \\cdot 1 \\, dx^1 dx^2 = K(p) \\iint_{T_E} dx^1 dx^2 $$\nThe integral $\\iint_{T_E} dx^1 dx^2$ is simply the area of the Euclidean triangle $T_E$.

Any corrections, whether from the Taylor expansions of the integrand ($K(x)\\sqrt{\\det g}$) or from the deformation of the integration domain, would involve higher powers of the small parameters $a$ and $b$ (e.g., $O(a^3b)$, $O(ab^3)$) and are therefore negligible for the leading-order result.\nThe final expression is the local version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, often known as the Bertrand-Diguet-Puiseux theorem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}K(p)ab}$$", "id": "3038090"}, {"introduction": "We now move from purely geodesic boundaries to explore the effect of a curved edge.

Let $S$ be the sum of the interior angles of the triangle $\\Delta$.\n\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a compact $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary, or a compact region $R$ of such a manifold, relates the geometry of the region to its topology.

Therefore, the first term is:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Delta} K \\, dA = \\int_{\\Delta} 0 \\, dA = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Euler Characteristic**: The region $\\Delta$ is a simple closed region in the plane, topologically equivalent to a disk.

Thus, the right-hand side of the theorem is $2\\pi \\chi(\\Delta) = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi$.\n\n3.  **Boundary Integral of Geodesic Curvature**: The boundary $\\partial\\Delta$ consists of three segments:\n    - The straight line segment from the origin $O$ to point $p$.\n    - The straight line segment from the origin $O$ to point $q$.\n    - The circular arc from $p$ to $q$.\n\n    In the Euclidean plane, straight lines are geodesics. By definition, geodesics have zero geodesic curvature. Therefore, the geodesic curvature is $0$ along the two straight segments of the boundary. The integral of $k_g$ over these two segments is zero.\n\n    The third segment is a circular arc of constant geodesic curvature $k_g$ and total arc length $L$, as given in the problem statement. The integral of the geodesic curvature over this arc is:\n    $$ \\int_{\\text{arc}} k_g \\, ds = k_g \\int_{\\text{arc}} ds = k_g L $$\n    The total boundary integral is the sum of the integrals over the three segments:\n    $$ \\int_{\\partial\\Delta} k_g \\, ds = 0 + 0 + k_g L = k_g L $$\n\n4.  **Sum of Exterior Angles**: Let the interior angles at the three vertices (origin $O$, point $p$, and point $q$) be $\\theta_O$, $\\theta_p$, and $\\theta_q$, respectively.

The result is in radians as required.\n\nIt is worth noting for verification, though not required for the solution, that in the Euclidean plane, the geodesic curvature $k_g$ of a circle of radius $r$ is $k_g = 1/r$. The arc length $L$ of a sector with angle $\\Phi$ is $L=r\\Phi$. Thus, the product $k_g L = (1/r)(r\\Phi) = \\Phi$. The interior angle at the origin is $\\theta_O = \\Phi$. The other two interior angles, where the radial lines meet the circular arc, are both $\\pi/2$ because a radius is perpendicular to the tangent of a circle at the point of intersection.

The angle defect depends only on the solid angle subtended by the triangle.\nThe specified triangles are spherical wedges defined by rectangular regions in $(\\theta, \\phi)$ coordinates: $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ and $\\phi \\in [0, \\phi_{max}]$. The integral is separable:\n$$\n\\delta = \\int_0^{\\phi_{max}} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = \\left(\\int_0^{\\phi_{max}} d\\phi\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\\right) = \\phi_{max} [-\\cos\\theta]_0^{\\pi/2} = \\phi_{max}(0 - (-1)) = \\phi_{max}\n$$\nThe exact angle defects are:\n- Case B: $R=1$, $\\phi_{max} = \\pi/2$. $\\delta_B = \\pi/2$.\n- Case C: $R=1$, $\\phi_{max} = 0.3$. $\\delta_C = 0.3$.\n- Case D: $R=2$, $\\phi_{max} = \\pi/3$. $\\delta_D = \\pi/3$.\n\nThe numerical estimator for these cases will sum over a grid in $(\\theta, \\phi)$ space. The mesh resolutions are $N_\\theta$ and $N_\\phi$. The cell dimensions are $d\\theta = (\\pi/2)/N_\\theta$ and $d\\phi = \\phi_{max}/N_\\phi$. The midpoint of cell $(i, j)$ is $(\\theta_{m,i}, \\phi_{m,j})$ where $\\theta_{m,i} = (i+0.5)d\\theta$ and $\\phi_{m,j} = (j+0.5)d\\phi$.\nThe contribution from each cell is $K(p_{ij}) \\Delta A_{ij} = \\sin(\\theta_{m,i}) d\\theta d\\phi$.\nThe total defect is approximated by:\n$$\n\\delta \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N_\\theta-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_\\phi-1} \\sin(\\theta_{m,i}) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = (N_\\phi \\, d\\phi) \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{N_\\theta-1} \\sin(\\theta_{m,i}) \\, d\\theta \\right) = \\phi_{max} \\sum_{i=0}^{N_\\theta-1} \\sin\\left(\\left(i+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)d\\theta\\right) d\\theta\n$$\nThis formula will be implemented for Cases B, C, and D with their respective parameters.\n\n**Case E: Hyperbolic Plane (Poincaré Disk)**\nThe Gaussian curvature is constant, $K = -1$. The area element in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ is $dA = \\frac{4}{(1 - r^2)^2} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $r^2 = x^2+y^2$.\nThe angle defect is $\\delta_E = \\int_{\\Delta_E} K \\, dA = - \\int_{\\Delta_E} \\frac{4}{(1-r^2)^2} \\, dx \\, dy$. This is equivalent to the negative of the hyperbolic area of the triangle.\n\nThe integration domain $\\Delta_E$ is defined by four conditions for a point $(x,y)$:\n1. $x \\ge 0$\n2. $y \\ge 0$\n3. $(x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 \\le r_{\\mathrm{circ}}^2$, where $c_x = 1.2$, $c_y = 1.2$, and $r_{\\mathrm{circ}}^2 = c_x^2 + c_y^2 - 1 = 1.2^2 + 1.2^2 - 1 = 1.44 + 1.44 - 1 = 1.88$.\n4. $x^2 + y^2  1$ (inside the Poincaré disk).\n\nThe numerical estimator meshes the bounding box $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ into $N_x \\times N_y$ cells, with $N_x=500$ and $N_y=500$. The cell dimensions are $dx=1/N_x$ and $dy=1/N_y$. The midpoint of cell $(i,j)$ is $(x_{m,i}, y_{m,j})$ where $x_{m,i} = (i+0.5)dx$ and $y_{m,j} = (j+0.5)dy$.\n\nFor each cell, we check if its midpoint $(x_m, y_m)$ satisfies the conditions for being in $\\Delta_E$. If it does, we add its contribution to the total defect. The contribution of a single cell centered at $(x_m, y_m)$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\delta = K(x_m, y_m) \\cdot \\Delta A = (-1) \\cdot \\frac{4}{(1 - (x_m^2 + y_m^2))^2} \\, dx \\, dy\n$$\nThe total defect is the sum of these contributions over all valid cells:\n$$\n\\delta_E \\approx \\sum_{i,j \\text{ s.t. } p_{ij} \\in \\Delta_E} - \\frac{4}{(1 - (x_{m,i}^2 + y_{m,j}^2))^2} \\, dx \\, dy\n$$\nThis will be implemented by generating a grid of midpoints, creating a boolean mask to identify points inside $\\Delta_E$, calculating the contribution for each grid point, and summing the contributions where the mask is true.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _calculate_spherical_defect(R, phi_max, N_theta, N_phi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the angle defect of a spherical wedge using numerical integration.\n    The wedge is defined by theta in [0, pi/2] and phi in [0, phi_max].\n    \"\"\"\n    K = 1.0 / (R**2)\n    theta_max = np.pi / 2.0\n    \n    d_theta = theta_max / N_theta\n    d_phi = phi_max / N_phi\n\n    # Midpoint theta values\n    theta_midpoints = (np.arange(N_theta) + 0.5) * d_theta\n    \n    # K*dA = (1/R^2) * R^2*sin(theta)*d_theta*d_phi = sin(theta)*d_theta*d_phi\n    # We can sum over phi first, which is a simple multiplication by N_phi\n    # as the integrand does not depend on phi.\n    # Sum_j(sin(theta_m)*d_theta*d_phi) = N_phi * sin(theta_m) * d_theta * d_phi\n    # Then sum over theta.\n    \n    # Vectorized sum over all theta midpoints\n    # The term sin(theta_m) * d_theta approximates integral of sin(theta) d_theta\n    # The term phi_max approximates integral of d_phi\n    defect_sum = np.sum(np.sin(theta_midpoints)) * d_theta * phi_max\n    \n    return defect_sum\n\ndef _calculate_case_a():\n    \"\"\"Case A (Euclidean plane, happy path)\"\"\"\n    # Gaussian curvature K=0, so the integral of K*dA is 0.\n    return 0.0\n\ndef _calculate_case_b():\n    \"\"\"Case B (Sphere with R=1, large right-angled geodesic triangle)\"\"\"\n    R = 1.0\n    N_theta = 600\n    N_phi = 600\n    phi_max = np.pi / 2.0\n    return _calculate_spherical_defect(R, phi_max, N_theta, N_phi)\n\ndef _calculate_case_c():\n    \"\"\"Case C (Sphere with R=1, small right-angled geodesic triangle)\"\"\"\n    R = 1.0\n    N_theta = 600\n    N_phi = 600\n    phi_max = 0.3\n    return _calculate_spherical_defect(R, phi_max, N_theta, N_phi)\n\ndef _calculate_case_d():\n    \"\"\"Case D (Sphere with R=2, medium right-angled geodesic triangle)\"\"\"\n    R = 2.0\n    N_theta = 600\n    N_phi = 600\n    phi_max = np.pi / 3.0\n    return _calculate_spherical_defect(R, phi_max, N_theta, N_phi)\n\ndef _calculate_case_e():\n    \"\"\"Case E (Hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk)\"\"\"\n    Nx = 500\n    Ny = 500\n    \n    # Bounding box for integration\n    x_lim, y_lim = 1.0, 1.0\n    dx = x_lim / Nx\n    dy = y_lim / Ny\n    \n    # Parameters for the third geodesic boundary (a circular arc)\n    cx, cy = 1.2, 1.2\n    r_circ_sq = cx**2 + cy**2 -
