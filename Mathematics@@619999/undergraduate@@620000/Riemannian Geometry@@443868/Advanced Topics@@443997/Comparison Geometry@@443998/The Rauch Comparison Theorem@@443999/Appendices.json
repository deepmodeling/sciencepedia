The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of differential geometry and differential equations.\n\nThe given initial value problem is:\n$$\ny''(t) + \\kappa y(t) = 0\n$$\nwith initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 1$. The solution is denoted by $s_{\\kappa}(t)$.\n\nThis is a homogeneous linear second-order ODE with constant coefficients. We begin by analyzing its characteristic equation:\n$$\nr^2 + \\kappa = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are $r = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\kappa}$. The nature of the roots, and consequently the form of the general solution, depends on the sign of the constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. We must therefore consider three distinct cases: $\\kappa  0$, $\\kappa = 0$, and $\\kappa  0$.\n\nCase 1: $\\kappa  0$ (Positive Curvature)\nIn this case, $-\\kappa  0$, so the roots of the characteristic equation are complex conjugates:\n$$\nr = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\kappa} = \\pm i\\sqrt{\\kappa}\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit. The general solution to the ODE is a linear combination of sinusoidal functions:\n$$\ny(t) = C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary constants. We determine these constants by applying the initial conditions.\n\nFirst, using $y(0) = 0$:\n$$\ny(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 \\cdot 1 + C_2 \\cdot 0 = C_1\n$$\nThus, $C_1 = 0$.

Integrating once with respect to $t$ yields:\n$$\ny'(t) = C_1\n$$\nIntegrating a second time yields the general solution:\n$$\ny(t) = C_1 t + C_2\n$$\nWe apply the initial conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. From $y(0) = 0$:\n$$\ny(0) = C_1 \\cdot 0 + C_2 = C_2\n$$\nSo, $C_2 = 0$. The solution is $y(t) = C_1 t$.\n\nFrom $y'(0) = 1$:\n$$\ny'(0) = C_1\n$$\nSo, $C_1 = 1$.\n\nTherefore, for $\\kappa = 0$, the unique solution is:\n$$\ns_{0}(t) = t\n$$\n\nCase 3: $\\kappa  0$ (Negative Curvature)\nIn this case, $-\\kappa  0$, so the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct:\n$$\nr = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\kappa}\n$$\nThe general solution can be written in terms of exponential functions.

We begin with the general framework.\n\nLet $(M, g)$ be a Riemannian $n$-manifold. A Jacobi field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is a vector field that arises from a variation of geodesics. If $\\gamma$ is parameterized by arc length $t$, the Jacobi equation is\n$$ \\nabla_{\\gamma'}\\nabla_{\\gamma'}J(t) + R(J(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor takes a specific form. For any orthonormal vectors $u, v$, we have $R(u,v)v = Ku$. A normal Jacobi field $J(t)$ is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$ for all $t$. Since $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, we have $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = 1$. The term $R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma'$ simplifies to $KJ$. Thus, the Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field $J$ on a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$ becomes the linear second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ J''(t) + K J(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $J''$ denotes $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}\\nabla_{\\gamma'}J$. To solve this vector-valued ODE, we can choose a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{E_1(t), E_2(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma(t)$ such that $E_1(t) = \\gamma'(t)$. Since the manifold is $2$-dimensional, any normal vector field must be proportional to $E_2(t)$. So we can write $J(t) = j(t)E_2(t)$ for some scalar function $j(t)$. As $E_2(t)$ is parallel transported, its covariant derivatives along $\\gamma$ are zero. The vector ODE then reduces to a scalar ODE for the function $j(t)$:\n$$ j''(t) + K j(t) = 0 $$\nThe initial conditions given are $J(0) = 0$ and $\\|J'(0)\\| = 1$. In terms of the scalar function $j(t)$, these become:\n$J(0) = j(0)E_2(0) = 0 \\implies j(0) = 0$.\n$J'(0) = j'(0)E_2(0)$, so $\\|J'(0)\\| = |j'(0)|\\|E_2(0)\\| = |j'(0)| = 1$. We can choose the orientation of $E_2(0)$ such that $j'(0) = 1$.\nSo, we must solve the scalar initial value problem $j''(t) + K j(t) = 0$ with $j(0) = 0$ and $j'(0) = 1$.\n\nFirst, we derive the Jacobi field in $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\\right)$.\nThe Euclidean plane is a flat manifold, so its sectional curvature is $K = K_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} = 0$. The Jacobi equation becomes:\n$$ j''(t) = 0 $$\nIntegrating twice gives the general solution $j(t) = c_1 t + c_2$. Applying the initial conditions:\n$j(0) = c_2 = 0$.\n$j'(t) = c_1$, so $j'(0) = c_1 = 1$.\nTherefore, the coefficient function is $j(t) = t$. The normal Jacobi field in the Euclidean plane is $J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t) = t E_2(t)$. The length of this field is $\\|J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)\\| = |t| \\|E_2(t)\\| = t$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we derive the Jacobi field in $\\left(S^{2}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$.\nThe round $2$-sphere of radius $r$ has constant positive sectional curvature $K = K_{S^{2}_{r}} = \\frac{1}{r^2}$. The Jacobi equation is:\n$$ j''(t) + \\frac{1}{r^2} j(t) = 0 $$\nThis is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is $j(t) = c_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) + c_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$. Applying the initial conditions:\n$j(0) = c_1 \\cos(0) + c_2 \\sin(0) = c_1 = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $j(t) = c_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$. Differentiating with respect to $t$:\n$j'(t) = \\frac{c_2}{r} \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$.\nApplying the second initial condition: $j'(0) = \\frac{c_2}{r} \\cos(0) = \\frac{c_2}{r} = 1$, which yields $c_2 = r$.\nTherefore, the coefficient function is $j(t) = r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$. The normal Jacobi field on the sphere is $J_{S^2_r}(t) = r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) E_2(t)$. The length of this field is $\\|J_{S^2_r}(t)\\| = \\left|r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)\\right|$.\n\nNow, we explain the appearance of conjugate points. A point $\\gamma(t_c)$ with $t_c  0$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ if there exists a nontrivial Jacobi field $J$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(t_c) = 0$.\nIn $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\\right)$, the Jacobi field is $J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t) = t E_2(t)$. For this field to be zero, its magnitude must be zero, so $t=0$. For $t  0$, $J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)$ is never zero. Thus, there are no conjugate points along any geodesic in the Euclidean plane. This corresponds to the geometric intuition that parallel lines never meet, and geodesics emanating from a point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ never reconverge.\n\nIn $\\left(S^{2}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$, the Jacobi field is $J_{S^2_r}(t) = r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) E_2(t)$. It vanishes when $r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) = 0$. Since $r0$, this occurs when $\\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) = 0$. This condition is met for $\\frac{t}{r} = k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. The first positive value $t_c$ for which this occurs corresponds to $k=1$, so $t_c = \\pi r$. The point $\\gamma(\\pi r)$ is the first conjugate point to $\\gamma(0)$. On a sphere, geodesics are great circles. All great circles starting at a point (e.g., the north pole) reconverge at its antipodal point, which is at a distance of $\\pi r$. The existence of this conjugate point is a direct consequence of the positive curvature of the sphere.\n\nThe Rauch comparison theorem provides a general explanation. It states that if we have two manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ with unit-speed geodesics $\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2$ and normal Jacobi fields $J_1, J_2$ satisfying $J_1(0)=J_2(0)=0$ and $\\|J_1'(0)\\|=\\|J_2'(0)\\|$, and if the sectional curvatures satisfy $K_1 \\le K_2$ along the geodesics, then the lengths of the Jacobi fields are related by $\\|J_1(t)\\| \\ge \\|J_2(t)\\|$.\nIn our case, let $M_1 = \\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\\right)$ and $M_2 = \\left(S^{2}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$. The curvatures are $K_1 = 0$ and $K_2 = \\frac{1}{r^2}$. Since $r  0$, we have $K_1 \\le K_2$. The theorem implies $\\|J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)\\| \\ge \\|J_{S^2_r}(t)\\|$. We found that $\\|J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)\\| = t$ and $\\|J_{S^2_r}(t)\\| = r\\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$ (for $t \\in [0, \\pi r]$). The inequality becomes $t \\ge r\\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$, which is a known result. The theorem formalizes the intuition that positive curvature has a focusing effect: it causes geodesics to converge more rapidly (or diverge more slowly) than in a space with less curvature. The length of the Jacobi field on the sphere is \"squeezed\" relative to the one in the plane, forcing it to become zero at $t_c = \\pi r$, while the linearly growing length of the Jacobi field in the plane never does.\n\nFinally, we compute the required product $K_{S^{2}_{r}}\\cdot (t_{c})^{2}$.\nWe have the sectional curvature $K_{S^{2}_{r}} = \\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ and the first conjugate time $t_{c} = \\pi r$.\nThe product is:\n$$ K_{S^{2}_{r}}\\cdot (t_{c})^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\right) \\cdot (\\pi r)^{2} = \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\cdot \\pi^{2} r^{2} = \\pi^{2} $$\nThe result is a universal constant, independent of the radius $r$ of the sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi^{2}}$$", "id": "3074549"}, {"introduction": "The power of comparison geometry is not limited to contrasting with constant curvature spaces; it extends to manifolds where curvature varies.

All conditions are met.\n\nThe problem asks to derive the scalar normal Jacobi equation and justify the formula for the radial sectional curvature, $K_r(t) = -f''(t)/f(t)$.\nA rotationally symmetric manifold with metric $g = dr^2 + f(r)^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ is a warped product $M = I \\times_f \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, where $I=(0,R)$ is an interval. The sectional curvature for a plane spanned by a vector $X$ tangent to the base $I$ and a vector $Y$ tangent to the fiber $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is given by a standard formula. In our coordinate system, let $X = \\partial/\\partial r$. The formula is $K(X,Y) = -\\frac{1}{f(r)} g_I(\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f), X)$.\nThe base manifold is the real line with metric $g_I=dr^2$. The gradient of the function $f(r)$ on the base is $\\text{grad}_I f = f'(r) (\\partial/\\partial r)$.\nWe compute the covariant derivative: $\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f) = \\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (f'(r) \\partial/\\partial r)$. Since the base is flat, the Christoffel symbols are zero, and the covariant derivative is just the partial derivative of the components, so $\\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (\\partial/\\partial r) = 0$. Using the product rule, we get $\\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (f'(r) \\partial/\\partial r) = (\\frac{d}{dr}f'(r)) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} = f''(r) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\nThen, $g_I(\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f), X) = g_I(f''(r)\\partial/\\partial r, \\partial/\\partial r) = f''(r)g_I(\\partial/\\partial r, \\partial/\\partial r) = f''(r) \\cdot 1 = f''(r)$.\nSubstituting this into the curvature formula gives $K(X,Y) = -f''(r)/f(r)$.\nA radial geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ from the pole with unit speed is parameterized by arc length $t$, so $r(t)=t$. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial/\\partial r$. A radial plane is any plane containing $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The sectional curvature of such planes, denoted $K_r(t)$, is therefore $K_r(t)|_{r=t} = -f''(t)/f(t)$.\nThe Jacobi equation along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. For a normal Jacobi field $J(t)$ (i.e., $g(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))=0$), its length squared is $|J|^2=y^2$. The Jacobi equation for the scalar function $y(t) = |J(t)|$ simplifies to $y''(t) + K(\\sigma(t))y(t) = 0$, where $K(\\sigma(t))$ is the sectional curvature of the plane $\\sigma(t)$ spanned by $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. In our case, this is the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$. Thus, the scalar normal Jacobi equation is $y''(t) + K_r(t)y(t)=0$.\n\nNext, we solve this ODE for the given warping function $f(r) = r - ar^3$ and initial conditions $y(0)=0, y'(0)=1$.\nFor a rotationally symmetric manifold, a normal Jacobi field vanishing at the pole $t=0$ has scalar part $y(t)$ given by $y(t) = f(t)$. Let's verify this. We need to check if $y(t)=f(t)$ satisfies the ODE and the initial conditions.\nThe ODE is $y'' + K_r(t)y = 0$, which is $y'' - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} y = 0$.\nIf we substitute $y(t)=f(t)$, we get $f''(t) - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)}f(t) = f''(t) - f''(t) = 0$. So $y(t)=f(t)$ is a solution.\nNow we check the initial conditions.\nFrom the problem statement $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$.\nSo, $y(0) = f(0) = 0$, and $y'(0) = f'(0) = 1$. Both initial conditions are satisfied.\nTherefore, the solution to the Jacobi equation with the specified initial conditions is simply the warping function evaluated at $r=t$.\nFor $f(r) = r(1-ar^2)$, the solution is $y(t) = f(t) = t(1-at^2) = t - at^3$.\n\nThe conjugate radius $t_c$ is the first positive time $t0$ where the Jacobi field vanishes, i.e., $y(t_c)=0$.\nWe solve $y(t) = t(1-at^2) = 0$.\nThe solutions are $t=0$ and $1-at^2=0$.\n$1-at^2=0$ implies $t^2 = 1/a$. Since $t$ must be positive, we take the positive root.\nThe first positive zero is $t_c = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n\nFinally, we apply the Rauch comparison theorem.\nFirst, we compute the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$ for our manifold.\n$f(t) = t - at^3$.\n$f'(t) = 1 - 3at^2$.\n$f''(t) = -6at$.\n$K_r(t) = -\\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} = -\\frac{-6at}{t - at^3} = \\frac{6at}{t(1-at^2)} = \\frac{6a}{1-at^2}$.\nWe are to compare this to a model space $(\\tilde{M}, \\tilde{g})$ of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa = 6a$.\nFor $t \\in (0, t_c) = (0, 1/\\sqrt{a})$, we have $0  t  1/\\sqrt{a}$, which implies $0  t^2  1/a$, so $0  at^2  1$.\nThis gives $0  1 - at^2  1$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{1-at^2}  1$.\nSince $a0$, we have $K_r(t) = 6a \\left(\\frac{1}{1-at^2}\\right)  6a = \\kappa$.\nSo, the sectional curvature of our manifold $M$ is strictly greater than the curvature of the comparison space $\\tilde{M}$ for all $t \\in (0, t_c)$.\n\nThe Rauch comparison theorem states that if $K_M \\ge K_{\\tilde{M}}$, then the first conjugate point in $M$ occurs no later than the first conjugate point in $\\tilde{M}$. That is, $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$.\nLet's find the conjugate radius $\\tilde{t}_c$ for the constant curvature space. The scalar Jacobi equation is $\\tilde{y}''(t) + \\kappa \\tilde{y}(t) = 0$, which is $\\tilde{y}''(t) + 6a \\tilde{y}(t) = 0$.\nThe general solution is $\\tilde{y}(t) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{6a}t) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\nThe initial conditions are $\\tilde{y}(0)=0$ and $\\tilde{y}'(0)=1$.\n$\\tilde{y}(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\tilde{y}'(t) = B\\sqrt{6a}\\cos(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\n$\\tilde{y}'(0) = B\\sqrt{6a} = 1 \\implies B = 1/\\sqrt{6a}$.\nSo, $\\tilde{y}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6a}}\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\nThe first positive conjugate point $\\tilde{t}_c$ occurs at the first positive zero of $\\tilde{y}(t)$. We must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c) = 0$, which means $\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi$.\nThis gives $\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\n\nThe Rauch theorem predicts $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$, which is $1/\\sqrt{a} \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\nThis inequality simplifies to $1 \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6}$, or $\\sqrt{6} \\le \\pi$.\nSquaring both sides gives $6 \\le \\pi^2$. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$, so the inequality $6 \\le \\pi^2$ is true. This confirms the theorem's application.\nThe physical interpretation of this inequality is that a region of higher curvature focuses geodesics more strongly. Since $K_r(t)  \\kappa$, our manifold is more curved along the geodesic path than the comparison space. This stronger focusing causes geodesics emanating from the pole to reconverge faster, leading to a smaller conjugate radius ($t_c  \\tilde{t}_c$).\n\nThe problem asks for the single analytic expression of the conjugate radius $t_c$ as a function of $a$. This was found to be $t_c = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}}$$", "id": "3036482"}]}
