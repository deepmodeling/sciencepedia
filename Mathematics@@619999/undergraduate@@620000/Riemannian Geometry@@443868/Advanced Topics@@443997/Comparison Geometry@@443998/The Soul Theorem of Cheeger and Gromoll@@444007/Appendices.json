We will proceed to solve the three tasks as requested.\n\nLet the Euclidean plane be $(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g)$, where $g$ is the standard metric $g = dx^{2} + dy^{2}$. The Riemannian distance $d(p_1, p_2)$ between two points $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the Euclidean norm of their difference, $d(p_1, p_2) = \\|p_1 - p_2\\|$.

Computation of the Busemann function $b_{\\gamma}(x,y)$**\n\nLet $p=(x,y)$ be an arbitrary point in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The Busemann function is defined by the limit:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(p) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\big(d(p,\\gamma(t)) - t\\big)\n$$\nFirst, we express the distance term $d(p, \\gamma(t))$.\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t)) = \\|p - \\gamma(t)\\| = \\|(x,y) - (t\\cos\\theta, t\\sin\\theta)\\|\n$$\nThe squared distance is:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t))^{2} = (x - t\\cos\\theta)^{2} + (y - t\\sin\\theta)^{2}\n$$\nExpanding the squares gives:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t))^{2} = x^{2} - 2xt\\cos\\theta + t^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta + y^{2} - 2yt\\sin\\theta + t^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta\n$$\nGrouping terms by powers of $t$:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t))^{2} = t^{2}(\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta) - 2t(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta) + (x^{2} + y^{2})\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta = 1$, and recognizing the dot product $p \\cdot u = x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta$ and the squared norm $\\|p\\|^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}$, we have:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t))^{2} = t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}\n$$\nThus, the distance is:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t)) = \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}}\n$$\nNow we compute the limit for $b_{\\gamma}(p)$. This is an indeterminate form of type $\\infty - \\infty$.\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(p) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left( \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}} - t \\right)\n$$\nWe multiply and divide by the conjugate expression:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(p) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\left( \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}} - t \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}} + t \\right)}{\\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}} + t}\n$$\nThe numerator simplifies to:\n$$\n(t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}) - t^{2} = -2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}\n$$\nSo the expression becomes:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(p) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{-2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}}{\\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t(p \\cdot u) + \\|p\\|^{2}} + t}\n$$\nTo evaluate the limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $t$:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(p) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{-2(p \\cdot u) + \\frac{\\|p\\|^{2}}{t}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2(p \\cdot u)}{t} + \\frac{\\|p\\|^{2}}{t^{2}}} + 1}\n$$\nAs $t\\to\\infty$, terms with $t$ in the denominator go to $0$:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(p) = \\frac{-2(p \\cdot u) + 0}{\\sqrt{1 - 0 + 0} + 1} = \\frac{-2(p \\cdot u)}{1 + 1} = - (p \\cdot u)\n$$\nExpressed in terms of the coordinates $(x,y)$ and the angle $\\theta$, the Busemann function is:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(x,y) = -(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta)\n$$\n\n**2. Description of the horoballs $H_{c}$**\n\nA horoball at level $c$ is the sublevel set $H_{c} = \\{\\,p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid b_{\\gamma}(p) \\le c\\,\\}$. Using our result for $b_{\\gamma}(p)$:\n$$\nH_{c} = \\{\\,p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid -(p \\cdot u) \\le c\\,\\}\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to:\n$$\np \\cdot u \\ge -c\n$$\nIn coordinates, this is:\n$$\nx\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta \\ge -c\n$$\nThe equation $x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta = -c$ defines a straight line in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The vector $u = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ is the normal vector to this line. The inequality $p \\cdot u \\ge -c$ describes the set of all points on this line and on one side of it, specifically the side towards which the normal vector $u$ points. Therefore, each horoball $H_c$ is a closed half-plane. The boundary of $H_c$ is the line orthogonal to the direction $u$ of the geodesic ray $\\gamma$. The level sets of the Busemann function, $\\{p \\mid b_{\\gamma}(p) = c\\}$, are called horocycles in general, and in this Euclidean case, they are straight lines given by $p \\cdot u = -c$.\n\n**3. Verification of convexity**\n\nTo verify that $b_{\\gamma}(x,y)$ is a convex function, we can compute its Hessian matrix and check if it is positive semi-definite. The function is:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(x,y) = -x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta\n$$\nThe first-order partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x} = -\\cos\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial y} = -\\sin\\theta\n$$\nThe second-order partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\cos\\theta) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\sin\\theta) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\cos\\theta) = 0\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix $H$ of $b_{\\gamma}$ is:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2} b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA matrix is positive semi-definite if for any non-zero vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the quadratic form $v^{T}Hv \\ge 0$. For the zero matrix, $v^{T}Hv = 0$ for all $v$. Since $0 \\ge 0$, the Hessian matrix is positive semi-definite. This confirms that the function $b_{\\gamma}(x,y)$ is convex on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

It represents a standard pedagogical example of applying the soul theory to the simplest non-trivial case.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a two-step solution: first, to determine the soul $S$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as specified by the context, and second, to construct the Sharafutdinov retraction $r: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to S$ using the given exhaustion function.\n\n**1. Determination of the Soul $S$**\n\nA soul $S$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be a compact, totally geodesic, and totally convex submanifold.\n- According to the provided facts, a totally geodesic submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be an affine subspace.\n- An affine subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if it is a single point. A higher-dimensional affine subspace (like a line or a plane) is unbounded and thus not compact.\n- Therefore, any soul of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be a single point, $S = \\{p\\}$ for some $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. A single point is trivially a totally geodesic and totally convex set.\n- The Cheeger-Gromoll theory states that for a given convex exhaustion function, the set of points where the function achieves its minimum is a soul. The problem directs us to use the function $h(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|x\\|^2$. This function is smooth and convex. Its minimum value is $0$, which is achieved uniquely at $x=0$.\n- The set of minima is therefore $S = \\{0\\}$. This is the specific soul we must consider for this problem. This also confirms that the soul is indeed a point, which we deduced from the general properties.\n\n**2. Construction of the Sharafutdinov Retraction $r(x)$**\n\nThe Sharafutdinov retraction $r(x)$ is defined as the limit of the integral curves of a unit-speed gradient flow. The flow is given by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = -\\frac{\\nabla h}{\\|\\nabla h\\|}(\\gamma(t))\n$$\nwith the initial condition $\\gamma_x(0) = x$.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient of the function $h(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|x\\|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. For an arbitrary point $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla h(y) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y_1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y_n} \\right) = (y_1, \\dots, y_n) = y\n$$\nThe norm of the gradient is $\\|\\nabla h(y)\\| = \\|y\\|$.\n\nThe critical set of $h$ is where $\\nabla h(y) = 0$, which is precisely the soul $S=\\{0\\}$. The flow is defined to be constant on the critical set. So, if the initial point is $x=0$, then $\\gamma_0(t) = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The limit is then $r(0) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\gamma_0(t) = 0$.\n\nNow, consider an initial point $x \\neq 0$. The ODE for the flow line $\\gamma_x(t)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}_x(t) = -\\frac{\\gamma_x(t)}{\\|\\gamma_x(t)\\|}\n$$\nThis equation indicates two things about the velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_x(t)$:\n- Its magnitude is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}_x(t)\\| = \\left\\| -\\frac{\\gamma_x(t)}{\\|\\gamma_x(t)\\|} \\right\\| = 1$. The curve is parameterized by arc length (it is unit-speed).\n- Its direction is $-\\frac{\\gamma_x(t)}{\\|\\gamma_x(t)\\|}$, which is a unit vector pointing from the current position $\\gamma_x(t)$ directly towards the origin $0$.\n\nSince the direction of motion is always towards the origin, the trajectory must lie on the straight line segment connecting the initial point $x$ to the origin $0$. The velocity vector is constant along this path: $\\dot{\\gamma}_x(t) = -\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}$.\n\nWe can solve for $\\gamma_x(t)$ by integrating the velocity:\n$$\n\\gamma_x(t) = \\gamma_x(0) + \\int_0^t \\dot{\\gamma}_x(s) \\, ds = x + \\int_0^t \\left(-\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\\right) \\, ds = x - t\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\gamma_x(t) = \\left(1 - \\frac{t}{\\|x\\|}\\right)x$.\n\nThis solution describes the motion for as long as $\\gamma_x(t) \\neq 0$. The trajectory reaches the origin when $\\gamma_x(t)=0$:\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{t}{\\|x\\|}\\right)x = 0\n$$\nSince $x \\neq 0$, this requires $1 - \\frac{t}{\\|x\\|} = 0$, which gives $t = \\|x\\|$.\n\nSo, the flow line starting at $x$ reaches the soul $S=\\{0\\}$ at the finite time $t = \\|x\\|$. For all subsequent times $t > \\|x\\|$, the point remains at the origin because the flow is defined to be constant on the soul. Thus, $\\gamma_x(t) = 0$ for all $t \\ge \\|x\\|$.\n\nThe Sharafutdinov retraction is the limit of this trajectory as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nr(x) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\gamma_x(t)\n$$\nSince for any $x \\neq 0$, the trajectory becomes fixed at $0$ for all $t \\ge \\|x\\|$, the limit is $0$.\nAs established earlier, for $x=0$, the retraction also yields $r(0)=0$.\n\nTherefore, for any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the Sharafutdinov retraction maps it to the origin. The final expression for $r(x)$ is the zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3077695"}, {"introduction": "The power of the Soul Theorem lies in its ability to describe the structure of complex manifolds that are not as simple as Euclidean space.

The concepts, such as the Soul Theorem, product metrics, and induced metrics, are standard and correctly stated. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address them in order.\n\n1. Determination of the soul of the paraboloid $P$.\nThe manifold $P$ is the surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by the equation $z = x^{2} + y^{2}$. This is a complete, noncompact $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with the metric induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The function $f(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2}$ is strictly convex, and as stated in the problem, this implies that the manifold $(P, g_P)$ has nonnegative sectional curvature. In fact, its Gaussian curvature is strictly positive everywhere except at the vertex. Thus, the conditions of the Soul Theorem of Cheeger and Gromoll are met, guaranteeing the existence of a soul $S_P \\subset P$.\n\nA soul is a compact, totally convex, and totally geodesic submanifold. Let's consider the point $p_0 = (0,0,0) \\in P$. We propose that the soul is the $0$-dimensional submanifold $S_P = \\{p_0\\}$.\n- **Compactness**: A single point is a compact set.\n- **Totally Geodesic**: A submanifold $S$ is totally geodesic if every geodesic in the ambient manifold starting at a point in $S$ and tangent to $S$ remains in $S$. The tangent space $T_{p_0}S_P$ is the zero vector space $\\{0\\}$. The only geodesic starting at $p_0$ with initial velocity $0$ is the constant path $\\gamma(t) = p_0$, which remains in $S_P$. Thus, $S_P$ is totally geodesic.\n- **Totally Convex**: A submanifold $S$ is totally convex if for any two points in $S$, every geodesic in the ambient manifold connecting them is contained entirely in $S$. For $S_P = \\{p_0\\}$, this condition is trivially satisfied as there is only one point.\n\nSince $S_P=\\{p_0\\}$ fulfills all the properties, it is a soul of $P$.\n\nWe must also justify why a one-dimensional soul cannot occur. A $1$-dimensional compact manifold is diffeomorphic to a circle, $S^1$. If a $1$-dimensional soul existed, it would have to be a closed geodesic on $P$. We analyze the geodesics on the surface of revolution $P$. By Clairaut's relation for a surface of revolution, for any geodesic, the quantity $\\rho \\sin\\alpha$ is constant, where $\\rho$ is the distance from the axis of rotation and $\\alpha$ is the angle between the geodesic and the meridians. The parallels of latitude are circles of constant $\\rho$. On such a circle, the principal normal vector is horizontal, pointing toward the axis of rotation. The surface normal vector to $P$ at a point away from the vertex (i.e., $\\rho > 0$) always has a vertical component. Thus, the principal normal of the curve and the normal to the surface are not parallel, which is a necessary condition for a parallel of latitude to be a geodesic. Therefore, no parallel of latitude with $\\rho>0$ is a geodesic. The only other possibility for a closed geodesic is one where $\\rho$ oscillates. However, for such a geodesic to close, it must be tangent to a parallel of latitude at its minimum and maximum distances from the axis (where $\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$). By Clairaut's relation, this would imply its minimum and maximum distances are equal, forcing it to be a parallel of latitude, which is a contradiction. The only possible closed geodesic is the degenerate one at $\\rho=0$, which is the point $p_0$. Therefore, no $1$-dimensional soul can exist in $P$. The soul must be $0$-dimensional, and thus is the point $S_P=\\{p_0\\}$.\n\n2. Exhibition of a soul of the product manifold $M$.\nThe manifold is $M = S^1 \\times P$, with the product metric $g = g_{S^1} \\oplus g_P$. As a product of two complete manifolds, $M$ is complete. $S^1$ has zero curvature, and $P$ has nonnegative sectional curvature. The product of two nonnegatively curved manifolds has nonnegative sectional curvature, so $M$ is a complete, noncompact manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature. The Soul Theorem applies.\n\nThe soul of a product of nonnegatively curved manifolds is the product of their respective souls. The circle $S^1$ is itself a compact, complete manifold with nonnegative curvature, so it is its own soul. The soul of $P$ is $S_P=\\{p_0\\}$.\nTherefore, we propose the soul of $M$ to be $S = S^1 \\times S_P = S^1 \\times \\{p_0\\}$. This is a submanifold of $M$ diffeomorphic to a circle.\n\nWe verify the properties of $S$:\n- **Compactness**: $S^1$ is compact and $\\{p_0\\}$ is compact, so their product $S$ is compact.\n- **Totally Geodesic**: Geodesics in a product manifold $N_1 \\times N_2$ are curves $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_1(t), \\gamma_2(t))$ where $\\gamma_1(t)$ is a geodesic in $N_1$ and $\\gamma_2(t)$ is a geodesic in $N_2$. A tangent vector to $S = S^1 \\times \\{p_0\\}$ at a point $(\\theta, p_0)$ is of the form $(v, 0)$, where $v \\in T_\\theta S^1$. A geodesic in $M$ starting at $(\\theta, p_0)$ with this initial velocity is $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_1(t), \\gamma_2(t))$, where $\\gamma_1(t)$ is the geodesic in $S^1$ with initial data $(\\theta, v)$ and $\\gamma_2(t)$ is the geodesic in $P$ with initial data $(p_0, 0)$. As established before, $\\gamma_2(t)$ must be the constant path $p_0$. Thus, $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_1(t), p_0)$, which remains in $S$ for all $t$. Hence, $S$ is totally geodesic.\n- **Totally Convex**: Let $q_1 = (\\theta_1, p_0)$ and $q_2 = (\\theta_2, p_0)$ be two points in $S$. Any geodesic $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_1(t), \\gamma_2(t))$ in $M$ connecting them must have component curves that are geodesics in the factor spaces. So, $\\gamma_1(t)$ is a geodesic in $S^1$ from $\\theta_1$ to $\\theta_2$, and $\\gamma_2(t)$ is a geodesic in $P$ from $p_0$ to $p_0$. Since $P$ has strictly positive curvature away from the vertex, and the vertex is its soul, the only geodesic from $p_0$ to $p_0$ is the constant path $\\gamma_2(t) = p_0$. Therefore, any geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ connecting $q_1$ and $q_2$ must be of the form $(\\gamma_1(t), p_0)$, which is contained in $S$. Thus, $S$ is totally convex.\n\nThis confirms that $S = S^1 \\times \\{p_0\\}$ is a soul of $M$.\n\n3. Description of the normal bundle $\\nu(S \\subset M)$.\nThe normal bundle $\\nu(S)$ over $S$ is the vector bundle whose fiber at a point $s \\in S$ is the orthogonal complement of the tangent space $T_sS$ within the tangent space $T_sM$, i.e., $\\nu_s(S) = (T_sS)^\\perp$.\n\nLet $s = (\\theta, p_0) \\in S = S^1 \\times \\{p_0\\}$.\nThe tangent space to the product manifold $M$ at $s$ is the direct sum of the tangent spaces of the factors:\n$$T_sM = T_{(\\theta,p_0)}(S^1 \\times P) = T_\\theta S^1 \\oplus T_{p_0}P$$\nThe tangent space to the soul $S$ at $s$ is:\n$$T_sS = T_{(\\theta,p_0)}(S^1 \\times \\{p_0\\}) = T_\\theta S^1 \\oplus T_{p_0}\\{p_0\\} = T_\\theta S^1 \\oplus \\{0\\}$$\nThe product metric $g = g_{S^1} \\oplus g_P$ ensures that the subspaces $T_\\theta S^1 \\oplus \\{0\\}$ and $\\{0\\} \\oplus T_{p_0}P$ are orthogonal.\nTherefore, the orthogonal complement of $T_sS$ in $T_sM$ is:\n$$\\nu_s(S) = (T_sS)^\\perp = (T_\\theta S^1 \\oplus \\{0\\})^\\perp = \\{0\\} \\oplus T_{p_0}P \\cong T_{p_0}P$$\nThe rank of the normal bundle, denoted by $k$, is the dimension of its fiber. The manifold $P$ is a $2$-dimensional surface, so its tangent space at any point is $2$-dimensional.\n$$k = \\text{rank}(\\nu(S \\subset M)) = \\dim(\\nu_s(S)) = \\dim(T_{p_0}P) = 2$$\nThe normal bundle is trivial. This is because the fiber space, $\\nu_s(S) \\cong T_{p_0}P$, is constant for all points $s = (\\theta, p_0)$ in the base space $S$. We can construct a global frame for $\\nu(S)$. Let $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ be any basis for the vector space $T_{p_0}P$. We can define two global sections $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2: S \\to \\nu(S)$ by $\\sigma_1(\\theta, p_0) = (0, e_1)$ and $\\sigma_2(\\theta, p_0) = (0, e_2)$ for all $\\theta \\in S^1$. These sections are smooth and form a basis for the fiber at every point of $S$. The existence of such a global frame implies that the normal bundle is trivial, i.e., $\\nu(S \\subset M) \\cong S \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe final requested value is the rank $k$ of the normal bundle $\\nu(S \\subset M)$. As calculated, this rank is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3077670"}]}
