We will proceed with a rigorous, step-by-step solution.\n\nLet $S^{n}$ be the $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r0$ embedded in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The metric on $S^{n}$ is induced by the standard inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The geodesic distance $d(p,q)$ between two points $p, q \\in S^{n}$ is the infimum of the lengths of all curves connecting $p$ and $q$. On the round sphere, geodesics are arcs of great circles. A great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a 2-dimensional plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nThe length of an arc on a great circle is given by $L = r\\theta$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere and $\\theta$ is the central angle in radians subtended by the arc. The geodesic distance $d(p,q)$ corresponds to the length of the shorter of the two arcs of the great circle connecting $p$ and $q$. The angle $\\theta$ between the position vectors of $p$ and $q$ satisfies $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$. Therefore, the geodesic distance is $d(p,q) = r\\theta$.\n\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is defined as $\\mathrm{diam}(M) = \\sup_{p,q\\in M} d(p,q)$. To find the diameter of $S^{n}$, we must find the maximum possible geodesic distance between any two points. This maximum is achieved when the angle $\\theta$ is maximal, which is $\\theta = \\pi$. This corresponds to a pair of antipodal points, which lie on opposite ends of a diameter of the sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. For such points, the geodesic distance is $d(p,-p) = r\\pi$. Thus, the diameter of $S^{n}$ in terms of its radius $r$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}(S^{n}) = r\\pi $$\n\nNext, we relate the radius $r$ to the constant sectional curvature $k$. For an $n$-sphere of radius $r$, the sectional curvature is constant and is given by the formula $k = \\frac{1}{r^2}$. Since the problem states $k0$, this is consistent. From this relation, we can express the radius in terms of the curvature:\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $r$ into our formula for the diameter, we obtain the diameter of $S^{n}$ purely in terms of its sectional curvature $k$:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}(S^{n}) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\n\nNow, we compute the Ricci curvature for a space form of dimension $n$ and constant sectional curvature $k$. The Riemann curvature tensor of such a space is given by:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = k(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y) $$\nwhere $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are tangent vectors. The Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y)$, is obtained by tracing the Riemann tensor. Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_pM$ at a point $p$. The component $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = \\mathrm{Ric}(e_i, e_j)$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(e_i, e_j) = \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\langle R(e_l, e_i)e_j, e_l \\rangle $$\nUsing the formula for $R$, we have:\n$$ \\langle R(e_l, e_i)e_j, e_l \\rangle = \\langle k(\\langle e_i,e_j\\rangle e_l - \\langle e_l,e_j\\rangle e_i), e_l \\rangle = k(\\langle e_i,e_j\\rangle \\langle e_l,e_l\\rangle - \\langle e_l,e_j\\rangle \\langle e_i,e_l\\rangle) $$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $\\langle e_a, e_b \\rangle = \\delta_{ab}$. Thus:\n$$ \\langle R(e_l, e_i)e_j, e_l \\rangle = k(\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ll} - \\delta_{lj}\\delta_{il}) = k(\\delta_{ij} - \\delta_{lj}\\delta_{il}) $$\nSumming over $l$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(e_i, e_j) = \\sum_{l=1}^{n} k(\\delta_{ij} - \\delta_{lj}\\delta_{il}) = k \\left( \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\delta_{ij} - \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\delta_{lj}\\delta_{il} \\right) $$\nThe first sum is $n\\delta_{ij}$. The second sum is non-zero only when $l=j$ and $l=i$ simultaneously, which means $i=j$. For $i=j$, the sum becomes $\\sum_{l=1}^{n}\\delta_{li}\\delta_{il} = 1$. For $i \\neq j$, the sum is $0$. So, $\\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\delta_{lj}\\delta_{il} = \\delta_{ij}$.\nTherefore,\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(e_i, e_j) = k(n\\delta_{ij} - \\delta_{ij}) = (n-1)k\\delta_{ij} $$\nThis shows that the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric tensor: $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)k g$.\nThe Ricci curvature in the direction of a unit vector $v$ is $\\mathrm{Ric}(v,v) = \\langle \\mathrm{Ric}(v), v \\rangle = (n-1)k \\langle v, v \\rangle = (n-1)k$.\n\nFinally, we consider the Bonnet–Myers theorem. The theorem states that if $(M^n, g)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \\ge 2$ and its Ricci curvature satisfies the lower bound $\\mathrm{Ric}(v,v) \\ge (n-1)C$ for some constant $C0$ and for all unit tangent vectors $v$, then $M$ must be compact and its diameter is bounded above by $\\mathrm{diam}(M) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{C}}$.\n\nFor the round sphere $S^{n}$ with constant sectional curvature $k0$, we are in the setting of a complete Riemannian manifold. We have just shown that its Ricci curvature is constant and equal to $(n-1)k$ for any unit vector. Thus, the condition of the Bonnet–Myers theorem is satisfied with the constant $C=k$. The theorem therefore provides the following upper bound on the diameter of $S^n$:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}(S^{n}) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nOur direct calculation yielded $\\mathrm{diam}(S^{n}) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$. The fact that the calculated diameter is exactly equal to the upper bound provided by the theorem demonstrates that the inequality in the Bonnet–Myers theorem is sharp. The round sphere $S^n$ is the model case that attains this bound, thereby confirming the theorem's sharpness.\n\nThe final required expression is the diameter of $S^n$ in terms of $k$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}}\n$$", "id": "3042096"}, {"introduction": "Beyond constraining a manifold's overall size, lower Ricci curvature bounds exert fine control over the local rate of volume growth.

The progression from a direct calculation on a model space (Part A), to a statement of a general comparison theorem (Part B), and finally to a specific evaluation (Part C) is logical and coherent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nPart A: We are asked to derive an explicit expression for the Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ acting on the distance function $r$, denoted $\\Delta r$, on the space form $M_{k}^{n}$. The operator $\\Delta$ is defined as the divergence of the gradient, $\\Delta f = \\mathrm{div}(\\nabla f)$. In local coordinates $(x^1, \\ldots, x^n)$, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $g_{ij}$ are the components of the metric tensor, $g^{ij}$ are the components of the inverse metric, and $\\det(g)$ is the determinant of the metric tensor.\n\nIn our case, we use geodesic polar coordinates $(r, \\theta^1, \\ldots, \\theta^{n-1})$ centered at $p$, where $(\\theta^1, \\ldots, \\theta^{n-1})$ are local coordinates on the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. Let $x^1 = r$ and $(x^2, \\ldots, x^n)$ correspond to the angular coordinates. The function is $f=r$. Its gradient vector, $\\nabla r$, has components $g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x^j}$. Since $r$ depends only on the first coordinate, we have $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial r} = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\theta^a} = 0$ for $a \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n\nThe metric is given as $g = \\mathrm{d}r^{2} + s_{k}(r)^{2}\\, g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$. This metric is diagonal with respect to the splitting between the radial and spherical parts. The components of the metric tensor are $g_{rr}=1$, $g_{ra}=0$ for $a \\neq r$, and the $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ block corresponding to the angular coordinates is $s_{k}(r)^{2} g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$. The inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$ is therefore also block diagonal with $g^{rr}=1$ and $g^{ra}=0$ for $a \\neq r$.\n\nThe formula for $\\Delta r$ simplifies considerably.

For $r0$ in the domain of the polar coordinates, $s_k(r)0$, so we can write $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = s_{k}(r)^{n-1} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}})}$.

The Laplacian of the distance function $r(x)=d(p,x)$ on this manifold is compared to the model space expression derived in Part A. This is the content of the Laplacian Comparison Theorem, also known as the Bishop-Gromov inequality for the Laplacian.

The right-hand side is precisely the value of the Laplacian of the distance function on the model space $M_k^n$ at the same radius, as shown in Part A.\n\nThis result can be derived by analyzing the second variation of arc length, which leads to the Riccati equation for the shape operator of geodesic spheres. The mean curvature $H$ of a geodesic sphere of radius $r$ is related to the Laplacian by $\\Delta r = (n-1)H$. The evolution of $H$ along a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ away from the origin is governed by a differential inequality that follows from the trace of the Riccati equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H}{\\mathrm{d}r} + H^2 + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\mathrm{Ric}(\\gamma', \\gamma') \\le 0\n$$\nUsing the given curvature bound $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\gamma', \\gamma') \\ge (n-1)k$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H}{\\mathrm{d}r} + H^2 + k \\le 0\n$$\nOn the model space $M_k^n$, this is an equality, and the mean curvature is $H_{k}(r) = \\frac{s_k'(r)}{s_k(r)}$. A standard comparison argument for solutions of first-order ordinary differential inequalities shows that if $H(r)$ is the mean curvature on $M$ and $H_k(r)$ is the mean curvature on $M_k^n$, then $H(r) \\le H_k(r)$ for all $r$ where both are defined. Multiplying by $(n-1)$ gives the desired inequality for $\\Delta r$.\n\nPart C: We are asked to specialize the expression from Part A to the case $n=4$, $k=1$ and evaluate at radius $r=\\pi/4$.\nFirst, we must find the function $s_1(r)$.

With $\\Delta f = -\\lambda f$, the condition for equality is:\n$$\n\\text{Hess}(f) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{n} f g\n$$\nFor $\\lambda = nk$, this becomes $\\text{Hess}(f) = -k f g$.\n\nWe now seek a non-constant function $f$ satisfying $-\\Delta f = nk f$ on $(S^n, g_k)$. Consider the sphere $S^n$ as isometrically embedded in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with radius $r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$. Let $x_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n+1\\}$ be the standard coordinate functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $f_i$ be the restriction of $x_i$ to $S^n$.\nThe Laplacian of $f_i$ on the sphere is given by the formula $\\Delta_{S^n} f_i = -\\frac{n}{r^2}f_i$. This is a standard result for the restriction of coordinate functions to a sphere of radius $r$. Substituting $r^2 = \\frac{1}{k}$, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta f_i = -n k f_i\n$$\nTherefore, $-\\Delta f_i = nk f_i$.\nThe coordinate functions $f_i(x) = x_i$ are non-constant functions on $S^n$ and are eigenfunctions of $-\\Delta$ with eigenvalue $nk$.\nSince we have established a lower bound $\\lambda_1 \\ge nk$ and found eigenfunctions that achieve this value, it must be the first nonzero eigenvalue.\nThus, $\\lambda_1 = nk$.\n\nThe family of eigenfunctions corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = nk$ includes any linear combination of the coordinate functions. Let $c = (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n+1})$ be a vector of constants in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The function $f_c(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} c_i x_i = c \\cdot x$, restricted to $x \\in S^n$, is an eigenfunction:\n$$\n-\\Delta(f_c) = -\\Delta\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} c_i x_i\\right) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} c_i \\Delta(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} c_i (nk x_i) = nk \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} c_i x_i\\right) = nk f_c\n$$\nThis space of eigenfunctions, spanned by $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_{n+1}\\}$, is an $(n+1)$-dimensional vector space.
