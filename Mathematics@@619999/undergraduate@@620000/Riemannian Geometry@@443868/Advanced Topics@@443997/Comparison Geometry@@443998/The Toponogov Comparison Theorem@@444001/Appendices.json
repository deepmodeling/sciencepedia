The manifold is the standard sphere $S^{2}$, a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. The problem asks to find the angle at vertex $p$ of a geodesic triangle $\\triangle pqr$. The side lengths, given as geodesic distances, are:\n$L_{qr} = d(q,r) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n$L_{rp} = d(r,p) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$\n$L_{pq} = d(p,q) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\nThe problem statement directs us to use the Toponogov comparison theorem. This theorem relates the geometry of a Riemannian manifold to that of a model space with constant sectional curvature.

We can therefore set the comparison curvature $\\kappa=1$. The model space $S^2_1$ is identical to our manifold $S^2$. The problem explicitly notes this: \"in constant curvature $1$ the comparison triangle is realized on $S^2$ itself\". This means that the inequalities in the comparison theorem become equalities. The relationship between the side lengths and a given interior angle of the geodesic triangle $\\triangle pqr$ is therefore precisely described by the laws of spherical trigonometry for a sphere of unit radius.\n\nWe wish to find the interior angle at the vertex $p$, which we denote as $\\alpha_p$. This angle is opposite the side connecting vertices $q$ and $r$, whose length is $L_{qr} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

Minimality of sides is necessary. Even in $S^{2}$ with the standard metric (so $K \\equiv 1$), if one allows a geodesic triangle whose one or more sides are geodesic segments longer than $\\pi$ (hence non-minimizing), then taking the side lengths in the comparison to be the lengths of those non-minimizing segments and the angle at the included vertex to be the angle between the corresponding geodesics at that vertex, one can obtain a violation of the expected comparison inequality against the $\\kappa = 1$ model. Thus dropping the minimizing-side hypothesis makes the statement false.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The proof of the theorem relies on properties of minimizing geodesics. A standard counterexample involves a \"triangle\" on the sphere $S^2$ (where $K \\equiv 1$) that includes a non-minimizing side (a great circle arc of length greater than $\\pi$). For such a configuration, the conclusion of the theorem can fail. For instance, the hinge version of the theorem (which compares the third side's length) can be violated. The hypothesis that the sides of the triangle are minimizing geodesics is therefore essential.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Replacing a lower bound on sectional curvature by a lower bound on Ricci curvature does not suffice. There exist metrics on $S^{3}$ (for example, certain Berger sphere metrics) with $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge c  0$ but with some sectional curvatures negative; for such a metric, the Toponogov conclusion with $\\kappa = 0$ can fail for hinges tangent to a $2$-plane of negative sectional curvature. Hence a Ricci lower bound cannot replace a sectional curvature lower bound.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The Toponogov theorem is fundamentally about sectional curvature, which governs the separation of geodesics in a specific 2-plane (via the Jacobi equation). Ricci curvature is an average of sectional curvatures and does not provide control in every direction. The Berger spheres are a canonical example of manifolds with positive Ricci curvature but some negative sectional curvatures. For a small hinge constructed in a plane of negative sectional curvature, geodesics will diverge faster than in Euclidean space ($\\kappa=0$). This leads to a violation of the conclusion of the hinge theorem for $K \\ge 0$ (which would state the third side is shorter than in the Euclidean case). Therefore, a sectional curvature bound is a necessary hypothesis and cannot be replaced by a Ricci curvature bound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Completeness is strictly necessary even locally: there exists a non-complete manifold $M$ with $K \\ge \\kappa$ and a strongly convex normal ball $B$ in which a geodesic triangle with minimizing sides violates the Toponogov comparison, showing that the comparison can fail inside a convex normal neighborhood if $M$ is not complete.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While completeness is a standard hypothesis for the global theorem, the proof of Toponogov's theorem is local in nature and works within a geodesically convex set. If a triangle and the necessary homotopy between geodesics can be contained within a single convex ball, the comparison holds. The standard counterexamples for non-complete manifolds (e.g., a plane with a slit) rely on the fact that the minimizing geodesic connecting two points is forced to leave any small convex set containing the other two sides of the triangle. The statement's claim that a violation occurs *inside* a convex ball is contradictory to how the proof works and how the counterexamples are constructed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. When $\\kappa  0$, no restriction on side lengths or perimeters is actually needed provided each side is minimizing. In particular, the comparison conclusion holds for any minimizing geodesic triangle, even if some side has length equal to $\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ or the perimeter exceeds $2\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. When $\\kappa > 0$, the model space is a sphere of radius $R = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. A comparison triangle with given side lengths $a,b,c$ can only be constructed on this sphere if the perimeter $a+b+c  2\\pi R$. If we have a minimizing geodesic triangle in our manifold $M$ whose perimeter is greater than or equal to $2\\pi R$, there is no corresponding comparison triangle in the model space. Without a comparison triangle, the theorem's conclusion cannot be drawn. The size restriction is therefore necessary for the theorem to be applicable as stated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Simple-connectedness is necessary for Toponogov comparison: there exists a non-simply-connected manifold $M$ with $K \\ge \\kappa$ and minimizing geodesic triangles for which the comparison to $M_{\\kappa}^{2}$ fails; the failure disappears upon passing to the universal cover.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The Toponogov comparison theorem does not require the manifold $M$ to be simply connected. The proof is based on comparing Jacobi fields along geodesics and works for any minimizing geodesic triangle, regardless of its homotopy class. The theorem applies just as well to a flat torus (non-simply-connected, $K=0$) as to the flat plane (simply connected, $K=0$). The hypothesis is not necessary.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3078549"}]}
