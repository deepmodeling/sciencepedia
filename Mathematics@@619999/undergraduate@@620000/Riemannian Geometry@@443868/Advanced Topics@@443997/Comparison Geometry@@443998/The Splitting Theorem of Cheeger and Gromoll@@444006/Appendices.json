A complete unit-speed geodesic line is given by $\\gamma(t) = x_{0} + t \\xi$, where $x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a fixed point and $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a unit vector, i.e., $|\\xi| = \\sqrt{\\langle \\xi, \\xi \\rangle} = 1$. The forward Busemann function is defined as $b^{+}(x) = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} \\big(t - d(x,\\gamma(t))\\big)$, where $d(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the standard Euclidean distance. The tasks are to find an explicit formula for $b^{+}(x)$, compute its gradient $\\nabla b^{+}(x)$, Hessian $\\operatorname{Hess} b^{+}(x)$, and Laplacian $\\Delta b^{+}(x)$, and to verify from first principles that the Hessian and Laplacian are identically zero. The givens are self-contained and mathematically consistent. The concepts are fundamental to differential geometry and multivariable calculus. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. Therefore, the problem is valid and we proceed to the solution.\n\nStep 1: Derive the explicit formula for $b^{+}(x)$.\nThe Riemannian distance $d(p, q)$ in Euclidean space is the norm of the vector difference, $d(p, q) = |p - q|$. For a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a point on the geodesic $\\gamma(t) = x_{0} + t \\xi$, the distance is:\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t)) = |x - (x_{0} + t \\xi)| = |(x - x_{0}) - t \\xi|\n$$\nWe compute the square of this distance using the inner product:\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t))^{2} = \\langle (x - x_{0}) - t \\xi, (x - x_{0}) - t \\xi \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n= |x - x_{0}|^{2} - 2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + t^{2} |\\xi|^{2}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, we have $|\\xi| = 1$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t))^{2} = t^{2} - 2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + |x - x_{0}|^{2}\n$$\nTaking the square root, we get the distance:\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t)) = \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + |x - x_{0}|^{2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this into the definition of the Busemann function:\n$$\nb^{+}(x) = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} \\left( t - \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + |x - x_{0}|^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis limit is of the indeterminate form $\\infty - \\infty$. To resolve it, we multiply and divide by the conjugate expression:\n$$\nb^{+}(x) = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} \\frac{\\left( t - \\sqrt{\\dots} \\right) \\left( t + \\sqrt{\\dots} \\right)}{t + \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + |x - x_{0}|^{2}}}\n$$\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\nt^{2} - \\left( t^{2} - 2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + |x - x_{0}|^{2} \\right) = 2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle - |x - x_{0}|^{2}\n$$\nFor the denominator, we can factor out $t$ from the square root for large $t$:\n$$\nt + \\sqrt{t^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{t} \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + \\frac{1}{t^{2}} |x - x_{0}|^{2} \\right)} = t + t \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2}{t} \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + \\frac{1}{t^{2}} |x - x_{0}|^{2}}\n$$\nSo the expression for $b^{+}(x)$ is:\n$$\nb^{+}(x) = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} \\frac{2t \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle - |x - x_{0}|^{2}}{t \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2}{t} \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + \\frac{1}{t^{2}} |x - x_{0}|^{2}} \\right)}\n$$\nWe divide the numerator and the denominator by $t$:\n$$\nb^{+}(x) = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} \\frac{2 \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle - \\frac{1}{t} |x - x_{0}|^{2}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2}{t} \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle + \\frac{1}{t^{2}} |x - x_{0}|^{2}}}\n$$\nAs $t \\to +\\infty$, all terms containing $1/t$ or $1/t^{2}$ approach $0$. Therefore, the limit is:\n$$\nb^{+}(x) = \\frac{2 \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle - 0}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 0 + 0}} = \\frac{2 \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle}{2} = \\langle x - x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product, we can write this as:\n$$\nb^{+}(x) = \\langle x, \\xi \\rangle - \\langle x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle\n$$\nThis is the explicit formula for the Busemann function. It is a linear affine function of $x$. The term $\\langle x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle$ is a constant.\n\nStep 2: Compute the gradient $\\nabla b^{+}(x)$.\nThe gradient of a scalar function $f(x)$ in Euclidean space is the vector of its partial derivatives. Let $x = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \\dots, x_{n})$ and $\\xi = (\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2}, \\dots, \\xi_{n})$. The function is:\n$$\nb^{+}(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\xi_{i} - \\langle x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $x_j$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x_{j}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j}} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\xi_{i} - \\langle x_{0}, \\xi \\rangle \\right) = \\xi_{j}\n$$\nThe gradient is the vector composed of these partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla b^{+}(x) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x_{1}}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x_{n}} \\right) = (\\xi_{1}, \\dots, \\xi_{n}) = \\xi\n$$\nThe gradient of the Busemann function is the constant vector $\\xi$ that defines the direction of the geodesic.\n\nStep 3: Compute the Hessian $\\operatorname{Hess} b^{+}(x)$ and verify it is zero.\nThe Hessian matrix is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives, with entries $(\\operatorname{Hess} b^{+}(x))_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} b^{+}}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}}$. From the previous step, we have $\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x_{j}} = \\xi_{j}$, which is a constant.\nTaking another partial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} b^{+}}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{i}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x_{j}} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{i}} (\\xi_{j}) = 0\n$$\nSince this is true for all $i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, all entries of the Hessian matrix are zero.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Hess} b^{+}(x) = 0_{n \\times n}\n$$\nwhere $0_{n \\times n}$ is the $n \\times n$ zero matrix. This completes the verification that the Hessian is zero everywhere.\n\nStep 4: Compute the Laplacian $\\Delta b^{+}(x)$ and verify it is zero.\nThe Laplacian of a function is the trace of its Hessian matrix when using an orthonormal basis like the standard one in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n$$\n\\Delta b^{+}(x) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\operatorname{Hess} b^{+}(x)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\operatorname{Hess} b^{+}(x))_{ii}\n$$\nSince all entries of the Hessian are $0$, the diagonal entries are also $0$.\n$$\n\\Delta b^{+}(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 0 = 0\n$$\nAlternatively, the Laplacian is the divergence of the gradient: $\\Delta b^{+}(x) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla b^{+}(x))$. We found $\\nabla b^{+}(x) = \\xi$, which is a constant vector field.\n$$\n\\Delta b^{+}(x) = \\nabla \\cdot \\xi = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial \\xi_{i}}{\\partial x_{i}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 0 = 0\n$$\nThis completes the verification that the Laplacian is zero everywhere. The function $b^{+}(x)$ is a harmonic function.\n\nThe required quantities are successfully computed and verified:\n$\\nabla b^{+}(x) = \\xi$\n$\\operatorname{Hess} b^{+}(x) = 0_{n \\times n}$\n$\\Delta b^{+}(x) = 0$\nThe final answer is presented as a single row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\xi & 0_{n \\times n} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3077998"}, {"introduction": "The Splitting Theorem's requirement of a *line*—a geodesic that is minimizing for all time in both directions—is a very strong condition.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe seek to identify which of the given manifolds $(M,g)$ satisfy all of the following five conditions:\n1. $(M,g)$ is complete.\n2. The Ricci curvature is non-negative: $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$.\n3. $(M,g)$ contains at least one ray.\n4. $(M,g)$ contains no lines.\n5. $(M,g)$ is not isometric to a Riemannian product $\\mathbb{R}\\times N$.\n\nNote that if a manifold satisfies conditions $1$, $2$, and $4$, then by the contrapositive of the Cheeger-Gromoll Splitting Theorem, it cannot be isometric to $\\mathbb{R}\\times N$. Thus, condition $5$ is a direct consequence of conditions $1$, $2$, and $4$. Our main task is to verify conditions $1$ through $4$ for each option.\n\n---\n**A. $(\\mathbb{R}^{2},g_{\\text{cig}})$, the Hamilton cigar metric given in Cartesian coordinates by $g_{\\text{cig}}=\\dfrac{dx^{2}+dy^{2}}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}$.**\n\nIn polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $r^2 = x^2+y^2$, the metric is $g_{\\text{cig}} = \\dfrac{dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2}{1+r^2}$.\n\n1.  **Completeness**: The length of a radial path from the origin $r=0$ to a coordinate radius $R$ is $L(R) = \\int_0^R \\frac{dr}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} = \\operatorname{arsinh}(R)$. As $R \\to \\infty$, $L(R) \\to \\infty$. Any path escaping to infinity must have infinite length, so the manifold is complete.\n2.  **Ricci Curvature**: This is a $2$-dimensional manifold, so $\\operatorname{Ric} = K g$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature. The metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric, $g_{\\text{cig}} = \\frac{1}{1+r^2}(dx^2+dy^2)$. Let $g = e^{2f} g_{\\text{eucl}}$. Here $e^{2f} = \\frac{1}{1+r^2}$. The Gaussian curvature is $K = -e^{-2f} \\Delta_{\\text{eucl}}(f)$, where $f=-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1+r^2)$. The flat Laplacian is $\\Delta_{\\text{eucl}}(f) = \\frac{d^2f}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{df}{dr} = -\\frac{2}{(1+r^2)^2}$. Thus, $K = -(1+r^2)\\left(-\\frac{2}{(1+r^2)^2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{1+r^2}$.\n    Since $K(r) = \\frac{2}{1+r^2} > 0$ for all $r$, the Ricci curvature $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\text{cig}}=Kg_{\\text{cig}}$ is strictly positive definite everywhere. Hence, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$ is satisfied.\n3.  **Rays**: A standard result states that in a complete manifold with non-negative sectional curvature (here $K > 0$), any geodesic segment is a minimizing path between its endpoints. The radial paths (e.g., $\\theta = \\text{const}$) are geodesics. A unit-speed radial geodesic starting from the origin is a ray. For instance, $\\gamma: [0, \\infty) \\to M$ is a ray. Thus, the manifold contains rays.\n4.  **Lines**: A fundamental result by Cheeger and Gromoll states that if a complete manifold $(M,g)$ with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$ has $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) > 0$ for some tangent vector $v$ at some point, then $(M,g)$ cannot contain a line. Since the Ricci curvature of the cigar metric is strictly positive everywhere, it cannot contain any lines.\n\nSince all four conditions are met, this manifold is a valid example. It does not split as $\\mathbb{R}\\times N$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n---\n**B. $(\\mathbb{R}^{2},g_{\\text{eucl}})$, the Euclidean plane with the flat metric $g_{\\text{eucl}}$.**\n\n1.  **Completeness**: The Euclidean plane is the archetypal complete manifold.\n2.  **Ricci Curvature**: The metric is flat, so all curvatures are zero. $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$, which satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$.\n3.  **Rays**: Any half-line, such as $\\gamma(t) = (t,0)$ for $t \\in [0, \\infty)$, is a ray.\n4.  **Lines**: Any straight line, such as $\\gamma(t) = (t,0)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, is a line.\n\nThis manifold contains lines. The question requires an example that does *not* contain a line. Furthermore, $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g_{\\text{eucl}})$ is isometric to $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, so it does split. Therefore, it is not a suitable example.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**C. $(S^{1}\\times\\mathbb{R},g_{\\text{prod}})$, the Riemannian product of the unit circle and the real line with the product metric $g_{\\text{prod}}$.**\n\n1.  **Completeness**: As a product of two complete manifolds ($S^1$ and $\\mathbb{R}$), the cylinder is complete.\n2.  **Ricci Curvature**: The Ricci curvature of a product is the sum of the Ricci curvatures of the factors. $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^1} \\ge 0$ and $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{R}} = 0$, so $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}} \\ge 0$.\n3.  **Rays**: The curves $\\gamma(t) = (p_0, t)$ for any point $p_0 \\in S^1$ and $t \\in [0, \\infty)$ are rays.\n4.  **Lines**: The curves $\\gamma(t) = (p_0, t)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are lines.\n\nThis manifold contains lines. It is also, by definition, a product $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$ (with $N=S^1$). This is an example where the conditions of the Splitting Theorem are met and the conclusion holds. It is not an example showing that the absence of a line is necessary.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**D. $M=\\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}: z=x^{2}+y^{2}\\}$ with the metric induced from $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ (the strictly convex paraboloid surface).**\n\nThis surface is a surface of revolution. Using cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\phi)$ in the $xy$-plane, the surface is parameterized by $\\mathbf{x}(r, \\phi) = (r\\cos\\phi, r\\sin\\phi, r^2)$. The induced metric is $g = (1+4r^2)dr^2 + r^2d\\phi^2$.\n\n1.  **Completeness**: The length of a radial path (a meridian, $\\phi=\\text{const}$) from the vertex $r=0$ to a coordinate radius $R$ is $L(R) = \\int_0^R \\sqrt{1+4r^2}dr$. Since $\\sqrt{1+4r^2} \\ge 2r$ for $r \\ge 0$, $L(R) \\ge \\int_0^R 2r dr = R^2$. As $R \\to \\infty$, $L(R) \\to \\infty$. The manifold is complete.\n2.  **Ricci Curvature**: For this $2$-dimensional surface, $\\operatorname{Ric} = K g$. The Gaussian curvature $K$ for a surface of revolution $z=f(r)$ is $K = \\frac{f'(r)f''(r)}{r(1+(f'(r))^2)^2}$. With $f(r)=r^2$, we have $f'(r)=2r$ and $f''(r)=2$. So $K(r) = \\frac{(2r)(2)}{r(1+(2r)^2)^2} = \\frac{4}{(1+4r^2)^2}$.\n    Since $K(r) > 0$ for all $r>0$, the Ricci curvature $\\operatorname{Ric}=Kg$ is positive definite for $r>0$ and non-negative at $r=0$. Hence, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$ is satisfied.\n3.  **Rays**: The surface has non-negative sectional curvature ($K\\ge 0$) and is complete. As in case A, any geodesic segment is minimizing. The meridians ($\\phi=\\text{const}$) are geodesics. A unit-speed geodesic along a meridian starting from the vertex ($r=0$) is a ray. The manifold contains rays.\n4.  **Lines**: As in case A, the Ricci curvature is strictly positive almost everywhere. A complete manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$ that has strictly positive Ricci curvature at even a single point cannot contain a line. Therefore, this paraboloid contains no lines.\n\nSince all four conditions are met, this manifold is a valid example.

The Busemann function is then computed as the limit:\n$$\nb^{+}(t,\\theta) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\left( s - \\sqrt{(s-t)^2 + A^2} \\right)\n$$\nMultiplying and dividing by the conjugate, we obtain:\n$$\nb^{+}(t,\\theta) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{s^2 - \\left((s-t)^2 + A^2\\right)}{s + \\sqrt{(s-t)^2 + A^2}} = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{s^2 - (s^2 - 2st + t^2 + A^2)}{s + s\\sqrt{(1-t/s)^2 + A^2/s^2}}\n$$\n$$\nb^{+}(t,\\theta) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{2st - t^2 - A^2}{s\\left(1 + \\sqrt{1 - 2t/s + (t^2+A^2)/s^2}\\right)} = \\frac{2t}{1+1} = t.\n$$\nThus, the Busemann function is $b^{+}(t,\\theta) = t$.\n\nThe second step is to compute the gradient $\\nabla b^{+}$ and analyze its properties. The function is $b^{+}(t, \\theta) = t$. Its differential is the $1$-form $\\mathrm{d}b^{+} = \\mathrm{d}t$. The metric tensor in coordinates $(x^1, x^2) = (t, \\theta)$ is $g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & R^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The inverse metric tensor is $g^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & R^{-2} \\end{pmatrix}$. The gradient vector field $\\nabla b^{+}$ has components $(\\nabla b^{+})^i = g^{ij}\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x^j}$. The partial derivatives of $b^{+}$ are $\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial t} = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. The components of the gradient are:\n$$\n(\\nabla b^{+})^{t} = g^{tt}\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial t} + g^{t\\theta}\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial \\theta} = (1)(1) + (0)(0) = 1.\n$$\n$$\n(\\nabla b^{+})^{\\theta} = g^{\\theta t}\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial t} + g^{\\theta\\theta}\\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial \\theta} = (0)(1) + (R^{-2})(0) = 0.\n$$\nTherefore, the gradient vector field is $\\nabla b^{+} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. The $b^{+}$-level set $N$ is defined by $b^{+}(t,\\theta) = 0$, which implies $t=0$. The set is $N = \\{(0, \\theta) \\in M \\mid \\theta \\in S^1\\}$, which is a smooth submanifold of $M$ diffeomorphic to $S^1$. The flow lines of $\\nabla b^{+}$ are the integral curves of this vector field. Since all Christoffel symbols of the metric $g$ are zero, $\\nabla b^{+}$ is a parallel vector field, and its integral curves are geodesics. These integral curves, being lines parallel to the $t$-axis, are perpendicular to the level sets $N_c = \\{(c,\\theta) \\in M \\mid \\theta \\in S^1\\}$ of $b^{+}$. The flow of $\\nabla b^{+}$ provides a way to move from one level set to another along orthogonal geodesics. This geometric structure generates the isometric splitting. The flow $\\phi_s$ of $\\nabla b^{+}$ maps a point $p \\in N$ to a point $\\phi_s(p)$ on another level set, thereby constructing a map from $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$ to $M$.\n\nThe third step is to explicitly construct the splitting map $\\Phi$. The map $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R} \\times N \\to M$ is generated by the flow of $\\nabla b^{+}$. Let $(s, p)$ be a point in $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$, where $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $p \\in N$. We define $\\Phi(s,p) = \\phi_s(p)$, where $\\phi_s$ is the flow of $\\nabla b^{+} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. The integral curve $\\gamma(s) = (t(s), \\Theta(s))$ starting at $p=(t_0, \\theta_0)$ is determined by the differential equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\nabla b^{+}$, which is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}s}=1$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Theta}{\\mathrm{d}s}=0$. Integrating yields $t(s) = s + t_0$ and $\\Theta(s)=\\theta_0$. For a starting point $p \\in N$, we have $p=(0, \\theta_p)$ for some $\\theta_p \\in S^1$. The integral curve starting at $p$ is $\\gamma_p(s) = (s, \\theta_p)$. The map $\\Phi$ is given by $\\Phi(s,p) = \\gamma_p(s)$. To express this in coordinates, we identify $N$ with $S^1$ through its coordinate $\\theta$. Let the coordinates on the domain $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$ be $(s, \\theta)$. The mapping $\\Phi$ sends $(s,\\theta) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ to the point in $M$ with coordinates $(t, \\Theta)$:\n$$\n\\Phi(s, \\theta) = (t(s,\\theta), \\Theta(s,\\theta)) = (s, \\theta).\n$$\n\nThe fourth and final step is to compute the pullback metric $\\Phi^{*}g$. The map is $\\Phi(s,\\theta)=(s, \\theta)$, which gives the coordinate transformation $t=s$ and $\\Theta=\\theta$, where $(t, \\Theta)$ are coordinates on the target manifold $M$ and $(s, \\theta)$ are coordinates on the domain $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$. The metric on $M$ is $g = \\mathrm{d}t^{2} + R^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Theta^{2}$. We compute the pullback by substituting the transformation of the differentials: $\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}s$, and $\\mathrm{d}\\Theta = \\mathrm{d}\\theta$. Substituting these into the expression for $g$:\n$$\n\\Phi^{*}g = (\\mathrm{d}s)^{2} + R^{2}(\\mathrm{d}\\theta)^{2} = \\mathrm{d}s^{2} + R^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta^{2}.\n$$\nThis is the product metric on $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$, where $\\mathrm{d}s^2$ is the standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}$ and $R^2\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta^2$ is the metric on the circle $S^1$ of radius $R$. This result confirms that the map $\\Phi$ is an isometry between $(\\mathbb{R} \\times N, \\mathrm{d}s^{2} + g_N)$ and $(M, g)$, where $g_N$ is the induced metric on $N$, thus demonstrating the isometric splitting explicitly. The final expression for the pullback metric is written in the coordinates $(s, \\theta)$ of the product space $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mathrm{d}s^{2} + R^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta^{2}}$$", "id": "3078001"}]}
