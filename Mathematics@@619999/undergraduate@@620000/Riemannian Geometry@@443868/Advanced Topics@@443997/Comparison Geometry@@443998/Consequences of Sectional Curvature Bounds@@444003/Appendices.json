Let $J(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n j_i(t) E_i(t)$, where $j_i(t)$ are scalar functions. Since the frame fields $E_i(t)$ are parallel transported ($\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E_i = 0$), the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$ are simply the ordinary derivatives of its components: $J'(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n j_i'(t) E_i(t)$ and $J''(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^n j_i''(t) E_i(t)$. The Jacobi equation then separates into $n-1$ independent scalar equations:\n$$j_i''(t) + j_i(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i = 2, \\dots, n$$\nThe general solution for each component is $j_i(t) = a_i \\cos(t) + b_i \\sin(t)$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are constants.\n\nWe use the initial conditions to determine these constants.\n1. $J(0) = 0$: This implies $j_i(0)=0$ for all $i$.\n   $j_i(0) = a_i \\cos(0) + b_i \\sin(0) = a_i$.

Such a time defines the first conjugate time to $t=0$ along $\\gamma$.\n\nWe have already imposed the condition $J(0)=0$. We now seek the smallest $t  0$ such that $J(t)=0$ for a nontrivial field. A nontrivial Jacobi field requires that its initial conditions are not both zero. Since $J(0)=0$, this means we must have $J'(0) = V \\neq 0$.\nThe condition $J(t)=0$ becomes:\n$$\\sin(t) V(t) = 0$$\nSince $V$ is a nonzero vector and $V(t)$ is its parallel transport, $V(t)$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, the equation can only be satisfied if the scalar factor $\\sin(t)$ is zero:\n$$\\sin(t) = 0$$\nThe solutions for $t$ are $t = k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. We are looking for the smallest *positive* time, so we must have $k  0$. The smallest such integer is $k=1$.\n\nThe first conjugate time is therefore $t = \\pi$. At this time, any Jacobi field originating at $\\gamma(0)$ with $J(0)=0$ will vanish again, regardless of its initial derivative $J'(0)=V$.

So, the sectional curvature $K(J, \\gamma')$ is:\n$$ K(J(t), \\gamma'(t)) = \\frac{\\langle R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma', J \\rangle}{|J|^2 |\\gamma'|^2 - \\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle^2} = \\frac{\\langle R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma', J \\rangle}{|J|^2} $$\nThus, $\\langle R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma', J \\rangle = K(J, \\gamma') |J|^2 = K(J, \\gamma') h(t)^2$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality for $h''(t)$:\n$$ h''(t) \\ge -\\frac{K(J(t), \\gamma'(t)) h(t)^2}{h(t)} = -K(J(t), \\gamma'(t)) h(t) $$\nThe problem states that all sectional curvatures satisfy $K \\le 0$. This implies $-K \\ge 0$. Since $h(t) = |J(t)| \\ge 0$, we have $-K(J(t), \\gamma'(t)) h(t) \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, we conclude that\n$$ h''(t) \\ge 0 $$\nThis means that $h(t) = |J(t)|$ is a convex function for $t \\in (0, T]$.\nFor a convex function, its graph lies above its tangent lines. That is, $h(t) \\ge h(t_0) + h'(t_0)(t-t_0)$ for any $t_0, t$. We apply this at $t_0=0$.\nThe value at $t=0$ is $h(0) = |J(0)| = 0$.\nWe need to find the right-sided derivative $h'(0^+)$.\n$$ h'(0^+) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\frac{h(t) - h(0)}{t} = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\frac{|J(t)|}{t} $$\nThe Taylor expansion of the Jacobi field $J(t)$ around $t=0$ is $J(t) = J(0) + J'(0)t + \\frac{1}{2}J''(0)t^2 + O(t^3)$.\nWe have $J(0)=0$. From the Jacobi equation, $J''(0) = -R(J(0), \\gamma'(0))\\gamma'(0) = 0$ since $R$ is a tensor and thus linear in its first argument.\nSo, $J(t) = J'(0)t + O(t^3)$.\nThen, $|J(t)| = |J'(0)t + O(t^3)| = |t||J'(0)| + O(t^3) = At + O(t^3)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n$$ h'(0^+) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\frac{At + O(t^3)}{t} = A $$\nUsing the convexity inequality with $t_0=0$:\n$$ h(t) \\ge h(0) + h'(0^+)t \\implies |J(t)| \\ge 0 + At $$\nSo, the lower bound on the growth of $|J(t)|$ is $|J(t)| \\ge At$. This is a version of the Rauch comparison theorem.\n\n**Part 2: Exact Solution for Hyperbolic Space**\n\nNow, we specialize to hyperbolic $n$-space $H^n$ with constant sectional curvature $K = -\\lambda^2$ for some $\\lambda0$.\nIn a space of constant curvature $K$, any Jacobi field $J(t)$ perpendicular to a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ and satisfying $J(0)=0$ can be written as $J(t) = s(t)E(t)$, where $E(t)$ is a parallel unit vector field along $\\gamma$ with $E(t) \\perp \\gamma'(t)$, and $s(t)$ is a scalar function.\nLet's substitute this form into the Jacobi equation. Since $E(t)$ is a parallel field, $E' = \\nabla_{\\gamma'}E = 0$.\n$J' = s'(t)E(t)$, and $J'' = s''(t)E(t)$.\nThe Jacobi equation becomes $s''(t)E(t) + R(s(t)E(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0$.\nBy linearity, this is $s''(t)E(t) + s(t)R(E(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0$.\nFor a space of constant curvature $K$, the curvature tensor has the form $R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)$.\nSo, $R(E, \\gamma')\\gamma' = K(\\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle E - \\langle E, \\gamma' \\rangle \\gamma')$.\nSince $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $\\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle=1$. Since $E \\perp \\gamma'$, $\\langle E, \\gamma' \\rangle=0$.\nThis simplifies to $R(E(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = K E(t)$.\nThe Jacobi equation reduces to:\n$$ s''(t)E(t) + s(t)(K E(t)) = 0 \\implies (s''(t) + K s(t)) E(t) = 0 $$\nSince $E(t)$ is a non-zero vector, the scalar part must be zero:\n$$ s''(t) + K s(t) = 0 $$\nWith $K = -\\lambda^2$, we get the second-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ s''(t) - \\lambda^2 s(t) = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $s(t) = C_1 \\cosh(\\lambda t) + C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda t)$.\nWe use the initial conditions for $J(t)$ to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n$J(0) = s(0)E(0) = 0$. As $E(0)$ is a unit vector, we must have $s(0)=0$.\n$s(0) = C_1 \\cosh(0) + C_2 \\sinh(0) = C_1 \\cdot 1 + C_2 \\cdot 0 = C_1$.\nSo, $C_1=0$, and the solution is of the form $s(t) = C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda t)$.\nNext, we use the condition on the derivative.\n$J'(t) = s'(t)E(t)$.\n$s'(t) = \\lambda C_2 \\cosh(\\lambda t)$.\n$J'(0) = s'(0)E(0) = \\lambda C_2 \\cosh(0) E(0) = \\lambda C_2 E(0)$.\nThe norm is $|J'(0)| = |\\lambda C_2 E(0)| = |\\lambda C_2| |E(0)|$.\nSince $|E(0)|=1$ and we are given $|J'(0)| = A$, we have $|\\lambda C_2| = A$.\nSince $\\lambda0$ and we may choose the orientation of $E(0)$ and sign of $C_2$ appropriately, we can write $\\lambda C_2 = A$, which gives $C_2 = \\frac{A}{\\lambda}$.\nThe scalar function is $s(t) = \\frac{A}{\\lambda} \\sinh(\\lambda t)$.\nFinally, we compute the norm $|J(t)|$:\n$$ |J(t)| = |s(t)E(t)| = |s(t)| |E(t)| $$\nSince $|E(t)|=|E(0)|=1$ (parallel transport preserves norm), we have $|J(t)| = |s(t)|$.\nFor $t \\ge 0$, and with $A0$ and $\\lambda0$, the function $s(t) = \\frac{A}{\\lambda} \\sinh(\\lambda t)$ is non-negative.\nTherefore, the exact expression for the norm is:\n$$ |J(t)| = \\frac{A}{\\lambda} \\sinh(\\lambda t) $$\nThis expression represents the exponential divergence of nearby geodesics in a space of constant negative curvature. It is consistent with the general lower bound $|J(t)| \\ge At$, since for $x \\ge 0$, $\\sinh(x) \\ge x$, which implies $\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\sinh(\\lambda t) \\ge \\frac{A}{\\lambda}(\\lambda t) = At$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{A}{\\lambda} \\sinh(\\lambda t)}$$", "id": "3042422"}]}
