The metric for this space is specified as $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ are the components of the standard Euclidean metric in global Cartesian coordinates $(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3})$. In these coordinates, the components $\\delta_{ij}$ are constant: $\\delta_{ij} = 1$ if $i=j$ and $\\delta_{ij} = 0$ if $i \\neq j$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the metric $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ satisfies the conditions for an asymptotically flat manifold.

The first condition is $g_{ij} - \\delta_{ij} = O(r^{-p})$.\nFor the given metric, we have $g_{ij} - \\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} - \\delta_{ij} = 0$. A function that is identically zero, $f(r) = 0$, is of order $O(r^{-p})$ for any value of $p$, since for any constant $C0$ and any $r0$, the inequality $|0| \\leq C r^{-p}$ is satisfied.

The second condition is $\\partial_{k}g_{ij} = O(r^{-1-p})$.\nSince the components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constants in Cartesian coordinates, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate $x^k$ are zero. Thus, $\\partial_{k}g_{ij} = \\partial_{k}\\delta_{ij} = 0$. As in the previous case, the identically zero function is of order $O(r^{-1-p})$ for any $p  \\frac{1}{2}$.
