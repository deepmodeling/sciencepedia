The operator is defined by the convention $\\Delta f = -\\operatorname{div}(\\nabla f)$, which ensures its spectrum is nonnegative. We will first compute $\\lambda_{1}(S^1)$ and then generalize to $\\lambda_{1}(S^n)$.\n\n### Part 1: First Nonzero Eigenvalue on $S^1$\n\nThe unit circle $S^1 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a $1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We can parameterize it using the angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. A function $f$ on $S^1$ can be viewed as a $2\\pi$-periodic function $f(\\theta)$. The standard round metric induced from the Euclidean metric of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is given in these coordinates by $g_{11} = 1$, i.e., the line element is $ds^2 = d\\theta^2$. The metric tensor is simply $g = (1)$, so its determinant is $\\det(g) = 1$ and its inverse is $g^{11} = 1$.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator in local coordinates $x^i$ is given by the general formula:\n$$\n\\Delta f = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j} \\right)\n$$\nFor $S^1$ with the coordinate $\\theta$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta f(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{1} \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( 1 \\cdot g^{11} \\frac{df}{d\\theta} \\right) = -\\frac{d^2f}{d\\theta^2}\n$$\nThe eigenvalue problem $\\Delta f = \\lambda f$ thus becomes the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{d^2f}{d\\theta^2} = \\lambda f\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is $f(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\theta) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\theta)$. For $f$ to be a well-defined function on the circle, it must be periodic with period $2\\pi$. This imposes the boundary conditions $f(\\theta) = f(\\theta+2\\pi)$ and $f'(\\theta) = f'(\\theta+2\\pi)$ for all $\\theta$. These conditions are satisfied if and only if $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ is an integer. Let $\\sqrt{\\lambda} = k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe possible eigenvalues are therefore $\\lambda_k = k^2$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$.\n- For $k=0$, we have $\\lambda_0 = 0$. The corresponding eigenfunctions are constant functions, $f(\\theta) = A$. This is the zero eigenvalue, associated with the space of constant functions.\n- For $k=1$, we have $\\lambda_1 = 1^2 = 1$. The eigenfunctions are of the form $f(\\theta) = A\\cos(\\theta) + B\\sin(\\theta)$. These are non-constant functions.\n- For $k > 1$, we obtain larger eigenvalues $\\lambda_k = k^2$.\n\nThe smallest strictly positive eigenvalue corresponds to $k=1$. Therefore, the first nonzero eigenvalue of $\\Delta$ on $S^1$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda_1(S^1) = 1\n$$\n\n### Part 2: First Nonzero Eigenvalue on $S^n$\n\nWe now compute the first nonzero eigenvalue on the unit $n$-sphere $S^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, equipped with its standard round metric $g$. We will use a method based on the geometry of $S^n$ as a hypersurface in Euclidean space, as suggested by the problem's constraints.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator is $\\Delta f = -\\operatorname{div}(\\nabla f)$. By definition, the divergence of a vector field $X$ is the trace of its covariant derivative, $\\operatorname{div}(X) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\nabla X)$. Thus, $\\Delta f = -\\operatorname{tr}(\\nabla(\\nabla f))$, which is the negative trace of the Hessian of $f$. Let $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a local orthonormal frame for the tangent space. Then:\n$$\n\\Delta f = -\\sum_{i=1}^n g(\\nabla_{E_i}(\\nabla f), E_i) = -\\operatorname{tr}_g(\\operatorname{Hess}_f)\n$$\nWe seek eigenfunctions $f$ and eigenvalues $\\lambda$ satisfying $\\Delta f = \\lambda f$.\n\nA natural set of test functions on $S^n$ are the restrictions of the linear coordinate functions of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $p = (p_1, \\ldots, p_{n+1})$ be a point on $S^n$. Consider the function $f: S^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(p) = p_1$. We compute its Laplacian.\n\n1.  **Gradient of $f$**: The gradient of $f$ on $S^n$, denoted $\\nabla_{S^n} f$, is the orthogonal projection of the ambient gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} f$ onto the tangent space $T_p S^n$. The ambient gradient of $f(p_1, \\ldots, p_{n+1}) = p_1$ is the constant vector field $e_1 = (1, 0, \\ldots, 0)$. The unit normal vector to $S^n$ at $p$ is $N(p) = p$.\n    The projection is given by:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_{S^n} f(p) = (\\nabla_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} f)^\\top = e_1 - \\langle e_1, p \\rangle p = e_1 - p_1 p\n    $$\n    Let $V$ denote this gradient vector field on $S^n$, so $V(p) = e_1 - p_1 p$.\n\n2.  **Hessian of $f$**: The Hessian tensor of $f$ is defined by $\\operatorname{Hess}_f(X,Y) = g(\\nabla_X(\\nabla f), Y) = g(\\nabla_X V, Y)$ for tangent vector fields $X, Y$. To compute the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X V$, we use the Gauss formula, which relates the intrinsic connection $\\nabla$ on $S^n$ to the flat connection $\\bar{\\nabla}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ (i.e., directional differentiation):\n    $$\n    \\bar{\\nabla}_X Y = \\nabla_X Y + \\mathrm{II}(X,Y)N\n    $$\n    where $\\mathrm{II}$ is the second fundamental form. For a vector field $W$ tangent to $S^n$, this implies $\\nabla_X W = (\\bar{\\nabla}_X W)^\\top$. We compute $\\bar{\\nabla}_X V$:\n    $$\n    \\bar{\\nabla}_X V(p) = \\bar{\\nabla}_X (e_1 - p_1 p) = \\bar{\\nabla}_X e_1 - \\bar{\\nabla}_X (p_1 p)\n    $$\n    Since $e_1$ is a constant vector field, $\\bar{\\nabla}_X e_1 = 0$. Using the product rule for derivatives:\n    $$\n    \\bar{\\nabla}_X (p_1 p) = (Xp_1) p + p_1 (\\bar{\\nabla}_X p)\n    $$\n    Here, $Xp_1$ is the directional derivative of the function $p_1$ along the vector field $X$, which is $\\langle \\nabla_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} p_1, X \\rangle = \\langle e_1, X \\rangle$. The derivative of the position vector field $p$ along a tangent vector $X$ is just $X$ itself, i.e., $\\bar{\\nabla}_X p = X$. Substituting these back:\n    $$\n    \\bar{\\nabla}_X V = - \\left( \\langle e_1, X \\rangle p + p_1 X \\right)\n    $$\n    Now, we take the tangential projection to find $\\nabla_X V$:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_X V = (\\bar{\\nabla}_X V)^\\top = -\\left( \\langle e_1, X \\rangle p + p_1 X \\right)^\\top\n    $$\n    Since $X$ is a tangent vector field, its tangential projection is $X$. Since $p$ is the normal vector, its tangential projection is $0$. Thus:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_X V = -p_1 X\n    $$\n    The Hessian is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Hess}_f(X,Y) = g(\\nabla_X V, Y) = g(-p_1 X, Y) = -p_1 g(X, Y)\n    $$\n    As a tensor, this means $\\operatorname{Hess}_f = -p_1 g = -f \\cdot g$.\n\n3.  **Laplacian of $f$**: We compute the Laplacian by taking the negative trace of the Hessian:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{S^n} f = -\\operatorname{tr}_g(\\operatorname{Hess}_f) = -\\operatorname{tr}_g(-f \\cdot g) = f \\cdot \\operatorname{tr}_g(g)\n    $$\n    The trace of the metric tensor $g$ is the dimension of the manifold, which is $n$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{S^n} f = n f\n    $$\n    This demonstrates that the coordinate function $f(p) = p_1$ is an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^n$ with eigenvalue $n$. The same reasoning applies to all coordinate functions $p_i$, $i=1, \\ldots, n+1$. These functions are non-constant, so $n$ is a nonzero eigenvalue.\n\nThe spectrum of the Laplacian on $S^n$ is known to be $\\{k(k+n-1) : k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}\\}$. For $k=0$, we have $\\lambda_0 = 0$. For $k=1$, we get $\\lambda_1 = 1(1+n-1) = n$. Our calculation explicitly constructs eigenfunctions for this eigenvalue. It is a fundamental result in spectral geometry, provable via the Rayleigh quotient and the Lichnerowicz-Obata theorem, that this is indeed the smallest strictly positive eigenvalue.\n\nTherefore, the first nonzero eigenvalue of $\\Delta$ on $S^n$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda_1(S^n) = n\n$$\n\nCombining the results for $S^1$ and $S^n$, the ordered pair is $(\\lambda_{1}(S^{1}),\\,\\lambda_{1}(S^{n})) = (1, n)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1, n)}$$", "id": "3075206"}, {"introduction": "Eigenvalues can be characterized variationally through the Rayleigh quotient, which provides a powerful tool for estimating them.

For $n \\ge 2$, $S^n$ is simply connected while $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ has a fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, so they are not even homeomorphic. For $n=1$, $S^1$ and $\\mathbb{RP}^1$ are both circles, but the standard metric on $S^1$ gives it length $2\\pi$, whereas the quotient metric on $\\mathbb{RP}^1$ gives it length $\\pi$, so they are not isometric.\n\nThe reason for this strict inequality can be understood at the level of eigenfunctions, as requested by the problem's framework. The equality $\\lambda_1=n$ on the sphere $S^n$ is achieved by the eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(S^n) = 1(1+n-1) = n$. These are the spherical harmonics of degree $k=1$. As established earlier, an eigenfunction on $S^n$ arising from a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k$ is odd if $k$ is odd and even if $k$ is even. Therefore, the eigenfunctions corresponding to $\\lambda=n$ (i.e., for $k=1$) on $S^n$ are all **odd** functions.\n\nHowever, the spectrum of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ consists only of eigenvalues corresponding to **even** eigenfunctions on $S^n$. Since the eigenfunctions on $S^n$ that would satisfy the equality condition (those for $k=1$) are all odd, they cannot descend to well-defined functions on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$. The eigenspace for $\\lambda=n$ on $S^n$ and the space of even functions on $S^n$ have only the trivial function $\\{0\\}$ in their intersection. Consequently, $\\lambda=n$ is not an eigenvalue of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$. The smallest available nonzero eigenvalue for $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ must correspond to the smallest nonzero even degree, $k=2$, which yields $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) = 2(n+1)$, a value strictly greater than $n$ for $n \\ge 1$. Thus, the equality case of the Lichnerowicz–Obata estimate cannot occur on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$.\n\nThe final requested expression is the value for the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2(n+1)}$$", "id": "3075201"}]}
