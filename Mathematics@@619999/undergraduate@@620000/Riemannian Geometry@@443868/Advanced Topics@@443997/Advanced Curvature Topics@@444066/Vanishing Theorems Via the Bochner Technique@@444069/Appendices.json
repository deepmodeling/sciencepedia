By computing their Ricci curvatures and applying the Weitzenböck formula, you will see firsthand how the positive curvature of the sphere forces its first Betti number to be zero (for $n \\ge 2$), while the zero curvature of the torus allows for a rich space of harmonic 1-forms.

No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the Ricci tensors for the $n$-sphere $S^n$ and the $n$-torus $T^n$, followed by an analysis of how these results impact the existence of nonzero harmonic $1$-forms via the Bochner technique. We will address each part in sequence.\n\nFirst, we compute the Ricci tensor for the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ with its standard metric of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. The Riemann curvature tensor of a Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ with constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by the formula for its $(0,4)$-version:\n$$R(X, Y, Z, W) = K \\left( g(Y, Z)g(X, W) - g(X, Z)g(Y, W) \\right)$$\nfor any vector fields $X, Y, Z, W$. For $S^n$, we are given $K=1$, so\n$$R(X, Y, Z, W) = g(Y, Z)g(X, W) - g(X, Z)g(Y, W)$$\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}$, is a $(0,2)$-tensor obtained by taking the trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. Specifically, for any vector fields $Y, W$, its value is given by $\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\operatorname{tr}(X \\mapsto R(X,Y)W)$. To compute this trace, we can choose an arbitrary point $p \\in M$ and a local orthonormal basis $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ for the tangent space $T_pM$. The trace is then the sum:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(R(E_i, Y)W, E_i)$$\nBy the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, $g(R(E_i, Y)W, E_i) = R(E_i, Y, W, E_i)$. Therefore,\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n R(E_i, Y, W, E_i)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the Riemann tensor of $S^n$:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( g(Y, W)g(E_i, E_i) - g(E_i, W)g(Y, E_i) \\right)$$\nSince $\\{E_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g(E_i, E_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The first term in the sum becomes:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y, W)g(E_i, E_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y, W) \\cdot 1 = n \\cdot g(Y, W)$$\nFor the second term, we recognize that for any vector $V$, its components in this basis are $V_i = g(V, E_i)$, and the inner product of two vectors $Y, W$ is $g(Y, W) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y, E_i)g(W, E_i)$. Thus:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n g(E_i, W)g(Y, E_i) = g(Y, W)$$\nCombining these results, the Ricci tensor for $S^n$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(Y, W) = n \\cdot g(Y, W) - g(Y, W) = (n-1)g(Y, W)$$\nAs a tensor, we write this as $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n} = (n-1)g$.\n\nSecond, we compute the Ricci tensor for the $n$-dimensional flat torus $T^n$. The term \"flat\" signifies that the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. This is because $T^n$ inherits its metric from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is flat. Thus, for any vector fields $X, Y, Z, W$:\n$$R(X, Y, Z, W) = 0$$\nSince the Ricci tensor is a trace of the Riemann curvature tensor, the trace of the zero tensor is necessarily the zero tensor. Therefore, for the flat torus $T^n$:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}_{T^n} = 0$$\n\nThird, we use the Bochner technique to interpret these results. The central tool is the Weitzenböck identity for a $1$-form $\\alpha$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$:\n$$\\Delta_d \\alpha = \\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha)$$\nHere, $\\Delta_d = d\\delta + \\delta d$ is the Hodge Laplacian on forms, $\\nabla^*\\nabla$ is the connection Laplacian (or rough Laplacian), and $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha)$ should be understood as the $1$-form metrically equivalent to the vector field $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\cdot)$, where $\\alpha^\\sharp$ is the vector field dual to $\\alpha$ via the metric. A $1$-form $\\alpha$ is defined as harmonic if $\\Delta_d \\alpha = 0$. For a harmonic $1$-form on a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold $M$ (which both $S^n$ and $T^n$ are), we can take the global inner product of the Weitzenböck identity with $\\alpha$ and integrate over $M$:\n$$\\int_M \\langle \\Delta_d \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle \\, dV_g = 0$$\nFor a harmonic form, this gives:\n$$\\int_M \\langle \\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha), \\alpha \\rangle \\, dV_g = 0$$\nUsing integration by parts (Green's identity), we have $\\int_M \\langle \\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle \\, dV_g = \\int_M |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 \\, dV_g$. The curvature term is $\\langle \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha), \\alpha \\rangle = \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp)$. This leads to the Bochner formula for a harmonic $1$-form $\\alpha$:\n$$\\int_M \\left( |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp) \\right) \\, dV_g = 0$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to our two manifolds.\n\nFor $S^n$, assuming $n \\geq 2$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)g$. The curvature term in the integral becomes:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp) = (n-1)g(\\alpha^\\sharp, \\alpha^\\sharp) = (n-1)|\\alpha|^2$$\nThe Bochner formula for $S^n$ is:\n$$\\int_{S^n} \\left( |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 + (n-1)|\\alpha|^2 \\right) \\, dV_g = 0$$\nThe term $|\\nabla \\alpha|^2$ is the squared norm of a tensor, so it is non-negative. For $n \\ge 2$, the factor $(n-1)$ is positive, so $(n-1)|\\alpha|^2$ is also non-negative. The integral of a sum of non-negative continuous functions over $S^n$ can be zero only if the integrand is identically zero. This implies:\n$$|\\nabla \\alpha|^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (n-1)|\\alpha|^2 = 0$$\nThe second equality implies $|\\alpha|^2 = 0$ since $n \\ge 2$, which means the $1$-form $\\alpha$ must be the zero form everywhere. Therefore, there are no non-zero harmonic $1$-forms on $S^n$ for $n \\ge 2$. By the Hodge theorem, this means the first de Rham cohomology group $H^1_{dR}(S^n, \\mathbb{R})$ is trivial. This demonstrates how positive Ricci curvature constrains the topology of the manifold. For $n=1$, $S^1$ is flat, so its Ricci tensor is zero, just like $T^1$.\n\nFor $T^n$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$. The Bochner formula simplifies significantly:\n$$\\int_{T^n} |\\nabla \\alpha|^2 \\, dV_g = 0$$\nThis implies that $|\\nabla \\alpha|^2 = 0$ everywhere, which means $\\nabla \\alpha = 0$. Thus, any harmonic $1$-form on the flat torus must be a parallel $1$-form. On $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$ with its flat metric, the Christoffel symbols are zero in the standard coordinate system $\\{x^i\\}$. A $1$-form $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i dx^i$ with constant coefficients $c_i$ has $\\nabla \\alpha = 0$ and is therefore parallel. Such forms are also harmonic: they are closed ($d\\alpha=0$ because coefficients are constant) and co-closed ($\\delta \\alpha = 0$ because the metric components are constant). Since we can choose non-zero constants $c_i$, there exists an $n$-dimensional space of non-zero harmonic $1$-forms on $T^n$, spanned by $\\{dx^1, \\dots, dx^n\\}$. This is consistent with $H^1_{dR}(T^n, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$. The vanishing Ricci curvature poses no obstruction and instead characterizes the harmonic forms as being precisely the parallel forms.\n\nIn summary, the positive Ricci curvature of $S^n$ ($n \\ge 2$) forces harmonic $1$-forms to vanish, while the zero Ricci curvature of $T^n$ allows for a rich space of harmonic $1$-forms.\nThe Ricci tensors are $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n} = (n-1)g$ and $\\operatorname{Ric}_{T^n} = 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(n-1)g & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3079733"}, {"introduction": "After seeing that positive Ricci curvature implies the vanishing of harmonic 1-forms, a natural question arises: does this principle extend to harmonic forms of higher degree?
