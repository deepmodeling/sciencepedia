We shall proceed by applying the two defining properties of the Levi-Civita connection: compatibility with the metric and the absence of torsion.\n\nLet the given orthonormal coframe be $\\{e^1, e^2\\}$, where $e^1 = d\\theta$ and $e^2 = \\sin\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The Riemannian metric in this coframe is given by $g = (e^1)^2 + (e^2)^2$, so the matrix of the metric tensor with respect to the dual frame $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ is the identity matrix, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe connection $1$-forms $\\omega^i{}_j$ are defined relative to the frame $\\{e_i\\}$ and are to be determined. The connection matrix is $\\omega = (\\omega^i{}_j)$.\n\nFirst, we use the property of metric compatibility. The Levi-Civita connection preserves the metric, which means the covariant derivative of the metric tensor is zero, $Dg=0$. For an orthonormal frame, this condition simplifies to the requirement that the matrix of connection $1$-forms is skew-symmetric. In terms of components, this is $\\omega_{ij} + \\omega_{ji} = 0$, where the indices are lowered with the metric tensor: $\\omega_{ij} = g_{ik}\\omega^k{}_j$. Since $g_{ik} = \\delta_{ik}$ in our orthonormal frame, we have $\\omega_{ij} = \\omega^i{}_j$. Thus, the metric compatibility condition is $\\omega^i{}_j + \\omega^j{}_i = 0$.\n\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ matrix of forms, this implies:\n$$ \\omega^1{}_1 + \\omega^1{}_1 = 0 \\implies \\omega^1{}_1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\omega^2{}_2 + \\omega^2{}_2 = 0 \\implies \\omega^2{}_2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\omega^1{}_2 + \\omega^2{}_1 = 0 \\implies \\omega^2{}_1 = -\\omega^1{}_2 $$\nThese three equations reduce the problem to finding a single unknown $1$-form, which we may choose to be $\\omega^1{}_2$.\n\nSecond, we use the property that the Levi-Civita connection is torsion-free.
