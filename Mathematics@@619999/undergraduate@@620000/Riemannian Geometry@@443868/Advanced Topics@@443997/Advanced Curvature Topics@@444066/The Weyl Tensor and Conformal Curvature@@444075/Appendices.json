A manifold is flat if and only if its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. A necessary condition for flatness is that all curvature invariants, such as the scalar curvature, must be zero everywhere.\nWe have found the scalar curvature at the origin to be $R_{g_{a}}(0) = -4an(n-1)$.\nGiven that $n \\geq 4$, the term $n(n-1)$ is a non-zero integer.
