This means that $Y(p)$ must be an eigenfunction of the Laplace–Beltrami operator: $\\Delta_{S^n(r)} Y(p) = \\lambda Y(p)$.\n\nTo compute $\\lambda$, we calculate $\\Delta_{S^n(r)} Y(p)$.

Its second partial derivatives are all zero, so its Euclidean Laplacian is $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} \\bar{Y} = 0$.\n2.  **Ambient Hessian:** Since $\\bar{Y}$ is linear, its Hessian tensor is identically zero. Thus, $\\text{Hess}_{\\bar{Y}}(\\nu, \\nu) = 0$.\n3.  **Shape Operator and Normal Vector:** For the sphere $S^n(r)$, the outward unit normal at a point $p$ is $\\nu(p) = \\frac{p}{r}$. The $n$ principal curvatures are all equal to $\\frac{1}{r}$. The trace of the shape operator is the sum of these curvatures: $\\text{tr}(S_p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{n}{r}$.\n4.  **Ambient Gradient:** The gradient of $\\bar{Y}(x) = \\langle v, x \\rangle$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $\\nabla_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} \\bar{Y} = v$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for the Laplacian:\n$$\n\\Delta_{S^n(r)} Y(p) = 0 - 0 - \\left(\\frac{n}{r}\\right) \\left\\langle v, \\frac{p}{r} \\right\\rangle = -\\frac{n}{r^2} \\langle v, p \\rangle\n$$\nSince $Y(p) = \\langle v, p \\rangle$, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta_{S^n(r)} Y(p) = -\\frac{n}{r^2} Y(p)\n$$\nThis shows that the first spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of $\\Delta_{S^n(r)}$ with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -\\frac{n}{r^2}$.\n\nNow we can solve for $A(t)$.

The constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition $u(0,p) = Y(p)$. Since $u(0,p) = A(0)Y(p)$, we must have $A(0) = 1$.

The constant $\\lambda_1$ is the decay rate.\n\n**Part 2: Lichnerowicz Eigenvalue Estimate**\n\nThe Lichnerowicz theorem provides a lower bound for the first nonzero eigenvalue of the positive Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold. Let $(M, g)$ be an $n$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. If its Ricci curvature tensor satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric}(X, X) \\ge (n-1)K|X|^2$ for all tangent vectors $X$ and some constant $K$, then the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the positive Laplacian $\\Delta_g = -\\Delta$ satisfies the inequality:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 \\ge nK\n$$\nFor the sphere $S^n(r)$, the sectional curvature is constant, $K_{sect} = \\frac{1}{r^2}$. The Ricci tensor of an Einstein manifold like the sphere is given by $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)K_{sect}g$. Therefore, for $S^n(r)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric} = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g\n$$\nFor any unit vector $X$, $\\operatorname{Ric}(X, X) = \\frac{n-1}{r^2}$. Comparing this with the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,X) \\ge (n-1)K|X|^2$, we see that the inequality holds with the optimal constant $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$.\n\nApplying the Lichnerowicz estimate with $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$, we obtain the lower bound for the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 \\ge n \\cdot K = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^2} = \\frac{n}{r^2}\n$$\nFrom Part 1, we found that the eigenvalue of $\\Delta_{S^n(r)}$ corresponding to the first spherical harmonics is $-\\frac{n}{r^2}$. The first spherical harmonics are known to correspond to the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Therefore, the first nonzero eigenvalue of the positive Laplacian $\\Delta_g = -\\Delta_{S^n(r)}$ is $\\lambda_1 = -(-\\frac{n}{r^2}) = \\frac{n}{r^2}$.\n\nWe can now verify the saturation of the estimate. The computed eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{n}{r^2}$, and the Lichnerowicz lower bound is also $\\frac{n}{r^2}$. Since $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\frac{n}{r^2}$ holds as an equality, we conclude that the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the sphere $S^n(r)$ saturates the Lichnerowicz bound.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit decay rate for $u(t,p)$. This is the constant multiplying $-t$ in the exponent of the time evolution term $A(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n}{r^2}t\\right)$.

Vanishing of Curvature in Dimension $n=1$**\n\nLet $(M,g)$ be a $1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. At any point $p \\in M$, the tangent space $T_pM$ is a $1$-dimensional real vector space.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor at $p$, denoted $R_p$, is a multilinear map $R_p: T_pM \\times T_pM \\times T_pM \\to T_pM$. A key property of the Riemann tensor is its skew-symmetry in the first two arguments:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = -R(Y,X)Z\n$$\nfor any tangent vectors $X, Y, Z \\in T_pM$.\n\nLet $X, Y \\in T_pM$. Since $\\dim(T_pM) = 1$, the vectors $X$ and $Y$ must be linearly dependent. Thus, there exists a scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $Y=cX$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the Riemann tensor and using its linearity (tensorial property) in the second argument, we get:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = R(X, cX)Z = c R(X,X)Z\n$$\nNow, applying the skew-symmetry property with $Y=X$:\n$$\nR(X,X)Z = -R(X,X)Z\n$$\nThis implies $2R(X,X)Z = 0$, which means $R(X,X)Z = 0$.\nConsequently, for any pair of vectors $X, Y$ in a $1$-dimensional tangent space, we have $R(X,Y)Z=0$. This demonstrates that the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero on any $1$-dimensional manifold.\n\nThe Ricci curvature tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}$, is defined as a trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. Specifically, if $\\{E_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space, $\\operatorname{Ric}(Z,W) = \\sum_i \\langle R(E_i, Z)W, E_i \\rangle$. Since $R \\equiv 0$, its trace must also be identically zero. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$ on any $1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold.\n\n**2. Triviality of the Lichnerowicz Bound in Dimension $n=1$**\n\nThe Lichnerowicz eigenvalue estimate (in one of its common forms) states that if, on a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Ricci curvature satisfies the lower bound $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) \\ge (n-1)K g(v,v)$ for some constant $K \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and all tangent vectors $v$, then the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian satisfies $\\lambda_1 \\ge nK$.\n\nLet's apply this to the case of $n=1$.\nThe premise becomes: $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) \\ge (1-1)K g(v,v) = 0$.\nAs we have proven, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$, so $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) = 0$. The condition $0 \\ge 0$ is satisfied for *any* constant $K \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe conclusion of the theorem is $\\lambda_1 \\ge nK = 1 \\cdot K$.\nSo, the theorem states: if $0 \\ge 0$ (which is always true), then $\\lambda_1 \\ge K$. This statement is true for any $K \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHowever, the purpose of the theorem is to derive a *lower bound* on $\\lambda_1$ from the geometry (i.e., from the given lower bound on $\\operatorname{Ric}$). To obtain the best possible lower bound from this theorem, we must use the largest possible value of $K$ for which the premise $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)K g$ holds.\nSince $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$, the premise is $0 \\ge (n-1)K g$.\n*   If $n>1$, this is $0 \\ge (n-1)Kg$, which implies $K \\le 0$. The best bound is achieved by taking $K=0$, yielding $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$, a trivial result if we do not assume $K$ is positive. The power of the theorem comes when one can establish the premise for a strictly positive $K > 0$, leading to $\\lambda_1 \\ge nK > 0$.\n*   If $n=1$, the premise is $0 \\ge (1-1)Kg = 0$, which holds for all $K$. However, this means the geometry provides no upper constraint on $K$. The entire mechanism of the proof, which balances a term involving $\\operatorname{Ric}$ against other terms, becomes an identity. Specifically, the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula, from which the estimate is derived, degenerates into a tautology and provides no constraint on $\\lambda_1$. Therefore, the theorem cannot produce any non-trivial bound. It can only reproduce the trivial bound $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$ (by taking $K=0$).\n\nFor a circle $S^1$ of length $L$, one can directly compute the eigenvalues of the Laplacian $\\Delta = -d^2/ds^2$ to be $\\lambda_k = (2\\pi k/L)^2$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The first nonzero eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = (2\\pi/L)^2 > 0$. The Lichnerowicz estimate fails to capture this positivity.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In $n=1$, the skew-symmetry of $R(X,Y)Z$ in $X$ and $Y$ forces $R\\equiv 0$ because there are no nontrivial $2$-planes, hence $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$. The Lichnerowicz estimate requires a strictly positive lower bound on $\\operatorname{Ric}$ to produce a positive lower bound on $\\lambda_1$, which fails in $n=1$, so it yields at best $\\lambda_1\\ge 0$ on $S^1$, even though $\\lambda_1>0$ by direct spectral computation.**\nThis explanation is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies that the linear dependence of any two tangent vectors in $1$D (i.e., no nontrivial $2$-planes for $X \\wedge Y$) combined with skew-symmetry forces $R \\equiv 0$ and thus $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$. It then correctly states that the mechanism of the Lichnerowicz theorem requires a geometric constraint (like a positive lower bound on Ricci curvature) to produce a positive eigenvalue bound. Since this constraint is absent ($\\operatorname{Ric}=0$), the theorem can only yield the trivial bound $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$. Finally, it correctly notes that this is in contrast to the actual, positive value of $\\lambda_1$ for $S^1$. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The circle $S^1$ has constant geodesic curvature $1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so its Ricci curvature is $1$, and therefore the Lichnerowicz estimate implies $\\lambda_1\\ge n$, matching the known positivity of the spectrum.**\nThis option confuses extrinsic and intrinsic geometry. The \"geodesic curvature\" of a curve in a plane is an extrinsic property related to its embedding. The Ricci curvature is an intrinsic property of the manifold $(S^1, g)$ itself. As we proved, the intrinsic Riemann curvature and Ricci curvature of any $1$-dimensional manifold are identically zero. Therefore, the premise \"its Ricci curvature is $1$\" is false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In dimension $n=1$, the scalar curvature equals twice the Gaussian curvature, and since the circle has curvature $1$, it follows that $\\operatorname{Ric}=1$, so the Lichnerowicz bound gives $\\lambda_1\\ge 1$.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Gaussian curvature is a concept defined for $2$-dimensional surfaces. It is not defined in dimension $1$. The scalar curvature $S$ is the trace of the Ricci tensor; since $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$, we must have $S \\equiv 0$. The claim that \"the circle has curvature $1$\" again relies on extrinsic geometry. The conclusion that $\\operatorname{Ric}=1$ is false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Since $\\lambda_1>0$ on $S^1$, one may choose any constant $K$ with $0<K<\\lambda_1$ in the Lichnerowicz estimate to conclude a nontrivial lower bound, regardless of the value of $\\operatorname{Ric}$ in $n=1$.**\nThis reverses the logic of the Lichnerowicz theorem. The theorem is a conditional statement: IF a condition on $\\operatorname{Ric}$ holds for a constant $K$, THEN a conclusion about $\\lambda_1$ follows. One cannot use prior knowledge of the conclusion ($\\lambda_1 > 0$) to select a $K$ and then claim the theorem provides a bound. The bound must be derived from the geometric premise. This argument is circular and misinterprets the theorem's function. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on $S^1$ is discrete, which implies the Riemann curvature tensor is positive definite; hence $\\operatorname{Ric}>0$ and the Lichnerowicz bound is sharp in $n=1$.**\nThe discreteness of the Laplacian's spectrum is a general property of all compact Riemannian manifolds, regardless of their curvature. A flat torus has a discrete spectrum but zero curvature. A compact hyperbolic manifold has a discrete spectrum but negative curvature. The implication that a discrete spectrum implies positive curvature is false. Consequently, the conclusion $\\operatorname{Ric}>0$ is false. The Lichnerowicz bound is also not sharp; it is trivial ($\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$), whereas the true value is strictly positive. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3055904"}]}
