The dimension of these vector spaces is to be expressed as a single closed-form expression in terms of $k$. We will analyze the cases $k=0$ and $k>0$ separately, following the definitions and principles outlined.\n\nThe $k$-th de Rham cohomology group is defined as the quotient space $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n) / B^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. Here, $Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the vector space of closed $k$-forms, which are $k$-forms $\\omega$ satisfying $d\\omega = 0$, where $d$ is the exterior derivative. $B^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the vector space of exact $k$-forms, which are $k$-forms $\\omega$ for which there exists a $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$ such that $\\omega = d\\eta$.\n\n**Case 1: $k > 0$**\n\nFor any $k > 0$, we wish to compute $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. The problem directs us to use the Poincaré lemma for star-shaped domains.\n\nFirst, we must establish that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a star-shaped domain. A set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be star-shaped with respect to a point $p \\in U$ if for every other point $x \\in U$, the line segment connecting $p$ and $x$ is entirely contained within $U$. Let us choose the origin $p=0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. For any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the line segment from $0$ to $x$ is parameterized by $\\{tx \\mid t \\in [0, 1]\\}$. Since $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a real vector space, it is closed under scalar multiplication. For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and any scalar $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the vector $tx$ is also an element of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Therefore, for all $t \\in [0, 1]$, the point $tx$ lies in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This confirms that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is star-shaped with respect to the origin.\n\nThe Poincaré lemma states that for a star-shaped open subset $U$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, every closed $k$-form with $k > 0$ is also an exact form. In terms of cohomology, this means $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U) = \\{0\\}$ for all $k > 0$.\n\nLet us apply this lemma to our manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $\\omega$ be an arbitrary closed $k$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $k > 0$. By definition of a closed form, $\\omega \\in Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, which means $d\\omega = 0$. Since $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a star-shaped domain, the Poincaré lemma guarantees the existence of a smooth $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\omega = d\\eta$. By definition of an exact form, this means $\\omega \\in B^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\nThis shows that any closed $k$-form (for $k>0$) is also an exact $k$-form, so $Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\subseteq B^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n\nThe reverse inclusion, $B^k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\subseteq Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, is a general property of the exterior derivative, stemming from the fundamental identity $d^2 = 0$. If a form $\\omega$ is exact, then $\\omega = d\\eta$ for some $\\eta$. Applying $d$ to $\\omega$ gives $d\\omega = d(d\\eta) = 0$, which proves that $\\omega$ is closed.\n\nCombining both inclusions, we have $Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n) = B^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $k > 0$.\nThe cohomology group is the quotient:\n$$H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\frac{Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)}{B^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)} = \\frac{Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)}{Z^k(\\mathbb{R}^n)} = \\{0\\}$$\nThis is the trivial vector space, whose dimension is $0$. Thus, for $k > 0$, we have $\\dim H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = 0$.\n\nThe problem's mention of a \"homotopy argument\" refers to the fact that the Poincaré lemma is a manifestation of the contractibility of star-shaped domains. $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is contractible, meaning it is homotopy equivalent to a single point. A general theorem in de Rham theory states that homotopy equivalent manifolds have isomorphic cohomology groups. The cohomology of a point is non-trivial only in degree $0$. This provides an alternative, more abstract justification for the same result. The proof of the Poincaré lemma itself involves constructing a homotopy operator, which makes the connection explicit.\n\n**Case 2: $k = 0$**\n\nFor $k=0$, we need to compute $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = Z^0(\\mathbb{R}^n) / B^0(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n\nA $0$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a smooth function $f \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\nThe space of closed $0$-forms, $Z^0(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, consists of all $0$-forms $f$ such that $df=0$. The exterior derivative of a function $f$ is the $1$-form $df = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} dx^i$. The condition $df=0$ is equivalent to the condition that all partial derivatives of $f$ vanish identically on $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i=1, \\dots, n $$\nSince $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a connected space, a function whose partial derivatives are all zero everywhere must be a constant function. Thus, $Z^0(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the space of constant functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This space is isomorphic to the field of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe space of exact $0$-forms, $B^0(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, is the image of the exterior derivative acting on the space of $(-1)$-forms, $\\Omega^{-1}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. By convention, the space $\\Omega^{-1}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is defined to be the zero vector space, $\\{0\\}$. Therefore, $B^0(\\mathbb{R}^n) = d(\\Omega^{-1}(\\mathbb{R}^n)) = \\{0\\}$.\n\nNow we can compute the $0$-th cohomology group:\n$$H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\frac{Z^0(\\mathbb{R}^n)}{B^0(\\mathbb{R}^n)} = \\frac{\\{\\text{constant functions on } \\mathbb{R}^n\\}}{\\{0\\}} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$$\nThe dimension of this vector space is $\\dim H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\dim(\\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n**Summary**\n\nWe have found the dimensions of the de Rham cohomology groups of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to be:\n$$ \\dim H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } k=0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } k>0 \\end{cases} $$\nThis result can be written concisely using the Kronecker delta symbol, $\\delta_{ij}$, which is defined as $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ if $i \\neq j$.

A cohomology class is an equivalence class of closed forms that differ by an exact form. We denote the class of a closed form $\\eta$ by $[\\eta]$.\n\nThe torus $T^2$ has two fundamental, non-contractible loops (1-cycles) which can be represented by $\\gamma_1: t \\mapsto (t, 0)$ and $\\gamma_2: t \\mapsto (0, t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nTo show that $[dx]$ and $[dy]$ generate $H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(T^2)$, we must show they are linearly independent and that they span the space. Let $\\eta$ be an arbitrary closed $1$-form on $T^2$. We can define two real numbers, $a = \\int_{\\gamma_1} \\eta$ and $b = \\int_{\\gamma_2} \\eta$. Now consider the $1$-form $\\eta' = \\eta - a\\,dx - b\\,dy$. This form is also closed, as $d\\eta' = d\\eta - a\\,d(dx) - b\\,d(dy) = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$. The integral of $\\eta'$ over the cycle $\\gamma_1$ is\n$$ \\int_{\\gamma_1} \\eta' = \\int_{\\gamma_1} (\\eta - a\\,dx - b\\,dy) = \\int_{\\gamma_1} \\eta - a \\int_{\\gamma_1} dx - b \\int_{\\gamma_1} dy $$\nWe have $\\int_{\\gamma_1} dx = \\int_0^1 dt = 1$ and $\\int_{\\gamma_1} dy = \\int_0^1 0\\,dt = 0$. Thus, $\\int_{\\gamma_1} \\eta' = a - a(1) - b(0) = 0$.\nSimilarly, for $\\gamma_2$, we have $\\int_{\\gamma_2} dx = 0$ and $\\int_{\\gamma_2} dy = 1$, so\n$$ \\int_{\\gamma_2} \\eta' = \\int_{\\gamma_2} \\eta - a \\int_{\\gamma_2} dx - b \\int_{\\gamma_2} dy = b - a(0) - b(1) = 0 $$\nA closed $1$-form on $T^2$ is exact if and only if its integral over every closed loop is zero. Since $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ generate the first homology group of the torus, showing the integrals are zero for them is sufficient. Therefore, $\\eta'$ is an exact $1$-form, meaning there exists a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\eta' = df$.\nThis implies $\\eta = a\\,dx + b\\,dy + df$. In terms of cohomology classes, this gives $[\\eta] = [a\\,dx + b\\,dy + df] = [a\\,dx + b\\,dy] + [df]$. Since $df$ is exact, $[df] = [0]$. Thus, $[\\eta] = a[dx] + b[dy]$. This shows that any class in $H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(T^2)$ is a linear combination of $[dx]$ and $[dy]$, so they span the space.\nTo show linear independence, assume $c_1[dx] + c_2[dy] = [0]$ for some scalars $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means the form $c_1\\,dx + c_2\\,dy$ is exact. If a form is exact, its integral over any closed loop is zero.

Together, spanning and linear independence mean that $\\{[dx], [dy]\\}$ forms a basis for $H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(T^2)$.\n\nNext, we explain why $[dx] \\wedge [dx] = 0$ and $[dy] \\wedge [dy] = 0$. The wedge product of cohomology classes is defined by $[ \\eta_1 ] \\wedge [ \\eta_2 ] = [ \\eta_1 \\wedge \\eta_2 ]$. The wedge product of any $1$-form with itself is zero. This is a fundamental property stemming from the anti-symmetric nature of the wedge product: for any $1$-form $\\phi$, $\\phi \\wedge \\phi = 0$. Applying this to the $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$, we have $dx \\wedge dx = 0$ and $dy \\wedge dy = 0$. Thus, $[dx] \\wedge [dx] = [dx \\wedge dx] = [0]$ and similarly $[dy] \\wedge [dy] = [dy \\wedge dy] = [0]$.\n\nTo show that $[dx] \\wedge [dy] \\neq 0$, we use the integration pairing. The class $[dx] \\wedge [dy]$ corresponds to the representative $2$-form $dx \\wedge dy$. If this class were zero, i.e., $[dx \\wedge dy] = [0]$, it would mean that $dx \\wedge dy$ is an exact form. According to Stokes' theorem, the integral of an exact form over a closed manifold (a manifold without boundary, such as $T^2$) is zero. Let's compute the integral of $dx \\wedge dy$ over $T^2$, using the fundamental domain $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(x,y)$:\n$$ \\int_{T^2} dx \\wedge dy = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 1 \\, dx \\, dy = 1 $$\nSince the integral is $1$ and not $0$, the form $dx \\wedge dy$ cannot be exact. Therefore, its cohomology class $[dx \\wedge dy]$ is non-zero.\n\nFinally, we identify the unique class $[\\omega] \\in H^2_{\\mathrm{dR}}(T^2)$ such that for any representative $\\omega \\in [\\omega]$, $\\int_{T^2} \\omega = 1$. The integration map $I: H^2_{\\mathrm{dR}}(T^2) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $I([\\eta]) = \\int_{T^2} \\eta$ is an isomorphism. This means for each real number $v$, there exists a unique cohomology class $[\\eta]$ such that $\\int_{T^2} \\eta = v$. We are seeking the class $[\\omega]$ for which this integral is $1$. As we have just calculated, $\\int_{T^2} dx \\wedge dy = 1$. Therefore, the unique class $[\\omega]$ satisfying the condition is precisely $[\\omega] = [dx \\wedge dy]$.\n\n2) Now we determine the scalar $c$. We are given the relation $[\\alpha] \\wedge [\\beta] = c\\,[\\omega]$ in $H^2_{\\mathrm{dR}}(T^2)$.\n\nFirst, we find the cohomology classes of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The form $\\alpha$ is given by\n$$ \\alpha = 2\\pi\\, dx + d\\!\\big(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\big) $$\nBy definition, two forms that differ by an exact form belong to the same cohomology class. Here, $\\alpha$ is the sum of the form $2\\pi\\,dx$ and the exact form $d(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. Thus, its cohomology class is:\n$$ [\\alpha] = [2\\pi\\, dx + d\\!\\big(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\big)] = [2\\pi\\, dx] + [d\\!\\big(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\big)] $$\nThe class of an exact form is the zero class, so $[d(\\sin(2\\pi x))] = [0]$. Hence,\n$$ [\\alpha] = [2\\pi\\, dx] = 2\\pi [dx] $$\nSimilarly, the form $\\beta$ is given by\n$$ \\beta = 3\\pi\\, dy + d\\!\\big(\\cos(2\\pi y)\\big) $$\nIts cohomology class is found by the same reasoning:\n$$ [\\beta] = [3\\pi\\, dy + d\\!\\big(\\cos(2\\pi y)\\big)] = [3\\pi\\, dy] + [d\\!\\big(\\cos(2\\pi y)\\big)] = [3\\pi\\, dy] = 3\\pi [dy] $$\nNow we can compute the wedge product of their cohomology classes:\n$$ [\\alpha] \\wedge [\\beta] = (2\\pi [dx]) \\wedge (3\\pi [dy]) $$\nUsing the bilinearity of the wedge product on cohomology, we have:\n$$ [\\alpha] \\wedge [\\beta] = (2\\pi)(3\\pi) ([dx] \\wedge [dy]) = 6\\pi^2 [dx \\wedge dy] $$\nWe are given the equation $[\\alpha] \\wedge [\\beta] = c\\,[\\omega]$. From part 1), we know that $[\\omega] = [dx \\wedge dy]$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n$$ 6\\pi^2 [dx \\wedge dy] = c [dx \\wedge dy] $$\nSince $[dx \\wedge dy]$ is a non-zero element (in fact, a basis) of the one-dimensional vector space $H^2_{\\mathrm{dR}}(T^2)$, we can equate the scalar coefficients.
