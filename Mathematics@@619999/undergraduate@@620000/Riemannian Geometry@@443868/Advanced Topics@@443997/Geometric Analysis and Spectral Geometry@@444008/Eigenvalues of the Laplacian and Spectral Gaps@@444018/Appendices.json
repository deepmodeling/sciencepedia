It is a well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically grounded problem in spectral theory, a subfield of Riemannian geometry and analysis. The posed question is a standard Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem for the one-dimensional Laplace operator with Neumann boundary conditions. We will proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem is to find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ and corresponding non-trivial eigenfunctions $f(x)$ for the differential equation\n$$ - \\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} = \\lambda f(x) $$\non the interval $x \\in [0, L]$, subject to the Neumann boundary conditions\n$$ f'(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f'(L) = 0 $$\nThe equation can be rewritten as\n$$ f''(x) + \\lambda f(x) = 0 $$\nThe character of the general solution to this second-order linear ordinary differential equation depends on the sign of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. We analyze the problem by considering three exhaustive and mutually exclusive cases for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nCase 1: $\\lambda < 0$.\nLet us set $\\lambda = -k^2$ for some real number $k > 0$. The differential equation becomes\n$$ f''(x) - k^2 f(x) = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear combination of hyperbolic functions:\n$$ f(x) = A \\cosh(kx) + B \\sinh(kx) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. To find the specific solution, we apply the boundary conditions. The first derivative of $f(x)$ is\n$$ f'(x) = Ak \\sinh(kx) + Bk \\cosh(kx) $$\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ f'(0) = Ak \\sinh(0) + Bk \\cosh(0) = Ak(0) + Bk(1) = Bk = 0 $$\nSince we have stipulated $k > 0$, this implies $B=0$. The solution thus simplifies to $f(x) = A \\cosh(kx)$. Now we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$ f'(L) = Ak \\sinh(kL) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, the eigenfunction $f(x)$ cannot be identically zero, which requires $A \\neq 0$. Also, $k > 0$ by construction and typically $L > 0$. The hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(z)$ is zero only if $z=0$. Thus, $\\sinh(kL)=0$ would imply $kL=0$, which contradicts $k>0$ and $L>0$. Consequently, we must have $A=0$. This leads to $f(x) = 0$, the trivial solution. Therefore, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\nCase 2: $\\lambda = 0$.\nThe differential equation simplifies to\n$$ f''(x) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $x$ yields the general solution\n$$ f(x) = Ax + B $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. We apply the boundary conditions to the first derivative, $f'(x)=A$.\n$$ f'(0) = A = 0 $$\n$$ f'(L) = A = 0 $$\nBoth conditions give $A=0$. The solution becomes $f(x) = B$. For this to be a non-trivial eigenfunction, we must have $B \\neq 0$. Any non-zero constant function is therefore an eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda=0$. We designate this first eigenvalue as $\\lambda_0 = 0$, with a corresponding eigenfunction such as $f_0(x) = 1$. This confirms the value of $\\lambda_0$ provided in the problem statement.\n\nCase 3: $\\lambda > 0$.\nLet us set $\\lambda = k^2$ for some real number $k > 0$. The differential equation is now\n$$ f''(x) + k^2 f(x) = 0 $$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator.

The solution simplifies to $f(x) = A \\cos(kx)$. Now we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$ f'(L) = -Ak \\sin(kL) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $A \\neq 0$.
