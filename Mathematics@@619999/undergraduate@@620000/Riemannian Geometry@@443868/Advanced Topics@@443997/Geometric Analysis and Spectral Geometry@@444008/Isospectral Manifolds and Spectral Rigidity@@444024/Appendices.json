The value $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2}$ is obtained from four pairs: $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$. The multiplicity is $4$.

After $0^2+0^2=0$ and $1^2+0^2=1$, the next integer that is a sum of two squares is $1^2+1^2=2$.\n- $\\lambda_0 = 0$, multiplicity $1$.\n- $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2}(1^2+0^2) = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2}$, multiplicity $4$ (from $(\\pm 1, 0), (0, \\pm 1)$).\n- $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2}(1^2+1^2) = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^2}$, multiplicity $4$ (from $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$).\nSo, for the square torus, the first three distinct eigenvalues are $0$, $\\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2}$, and $\\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^2}$, with multiplicities $1$, $4$, and $4$, respectively.\n\nFor a general rectangular torus ($\\rho \\neq 1$), let's assume without loss of generality $a > b$, so $\\rho = b/a  1$.\n- $\\lambda_0 = 0$, multiplicity $1$.\n- $\\lambda_1 = 4\\pi^2/a^2$, from $(\\pm 1, 0)$, multiplicity $2$.\n- The candidates for $\\lambda_2$ are $4\\pi^2/b^2$ (from $(0, \\pm 1)$), $16\\pi^2/a^2$ (from $(\\pm 2, 0)$), and $4\\pi^2(1/a^2 + 1/b^2)$ (from $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$). In general, $\\lambda_2 = 4\\pi^2 \\min(1/b^2, 4/a^2, 1/a^2+1/b^2)$. The specific value and multiplicity depend on the value of $\\rho$. For example if $\\rho$ is very small ($a \\gg b$), then $1/b^2$ will be the dominant term and the second non-zero eigenvalue will likely be $4\\pi^2/b^2$. If $\\rho$ is close to $1/2$ ($a \\approx 2b$), then $1/b^2 \\approx 4/a^2$, leading to an accidental degeneracy.
