We are also asked to find the first singularity time $t_{\\ast}$ when $\\lambda  0$. The derivation must be from first principles, using only the given definitions and the scaling properties of curvature.\n\nGiven the high degree of symmetry implied by the Einstein condition, we seek a solution of the form $g(t) = c(t)g_{0}$, where $c(t)$ is a time-dependent scaling function. For this to be a valid Riemannian metric, we must have $c(t)  0$. The initial condition $g(0) = g_{0}$ implies $c(0)g_{0} = g_{0}$, which gives the initial condition for the scaling function: $c(0) = 1$.\n\nWe substitute this ansatz into the Ricci flow equation. The left-hand side (LHS) is the time derivative of $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left(c(t)g_{0}\\right) = \\frac{dc(t)}{dt} g_{0} = c'(t) g_{0}\n$$\n\nFor the right-hand side (RHS), we need to determine the Ricci tensor of $g(t)$, which is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}$. At any fixed time $t$, $g(t)$ is a constant multiple of $g_{0}$, i.e., $g(t) = k g_{0}$ where $k = c(t)$ is a constant with respect to the spatial coordinates. We now analyze how the Ricci tensor transforms under such a constant scaling of the metric. Let $\\tilde{g} = k g$ for a positive constant $k$. The components of the metrics are related by $\\tilde{g}_{ij} = k g_{ij}$, and the components of the inverse metrics are related by $\\tilde{g}^{ij} = k^{-1} g^{ij}$.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection are given by the formula:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{g}^{kl} \\left( \\partial_{i}\\tilde{g}_{lj} + \\partial_{j}\\tilde{g}_{li} - \\partial_{l}\\tilde{g}_{ij} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tilde{g}_{ij}$ and $\\tilde{g}^{kl}$ yields:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{1}{2} (k^{-1} g^{kl}) \\left( \\partial_{i}(k g_{lj}) + \\partial_{j}(k g_{li}) - \\partial_{l}(k g_{ij}) \\right)\n$$\nSince $k$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the derivatives and from the expression:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{k}{2k} g^{kl} \\left( \\partial_{i}g_{lj} + \\partial_{j}g_{li} - \\partial_{l}g_{ij} \\right) = \\Gamma_{ij}^{k}\n$$\nThis shows that the Christoffel symbols are invariant under a constant scaling of the metric.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor, in components $R^{l}_{ijk}$, is defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives. Since the Christoffel symbols are invariant under scaling, the Riemann tensor of type $(1,3)$ is also invariant: $\\tilde{R}^{l}_{ijk} = R^{l}_{ijk}$.\n\nThe Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} = R^{i}_{jik}$. Again, since the $(1,3)$ Riemann tensor is invariant, its contraction is also invariant.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g})_{jk} = \\tilde{R}^{i}_{jik} = R^{i}_{jik} = \\operatorname{Ric}(g)_{jk}\n$$\nTherefore, the Ricci tensor as a $(0,2)$-tensor is invariant under a constant scaling of the metric.\n\nApplying this result to our ansatz $g(t) = c(t) g_{0}$, we find that for any fixed $t$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{0}}\n$$\nWe are given that the initial metric $g_{0}$ is an Einstein metric, so $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{0}} = \\lambda g_{0}$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)} = \\lambda g_{0}\n$$\nNow we can write the full expression for the RHS of the Ricci flow equation:\n$$\n-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)} = -2 \\lambda g_{0}\n$$\nEquating the LHS and RHS, we have:\n$$\nc'(t) g_{0} = -2\\lambda g_{0}\n$$\nSince $g_{0}$ is a non-degenerate metric, this tensor equation implies the scalar ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\nc'(t) = -2\\lambda\n$$\nWe solve this ODE with the initial condition $c(0) = 1$. Integrating with respect to $t$ gives $c(t) = -2\\lambda t + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration. Using the initial condition:\n$$\nc(0) = -2\\lambda(0) + C = 1 \\implies C = 1\n$$\nThus, the scaling function is $c(t) = 1 - 2\\lambda t$. The explicit expression for the evolving metric is:\n$$\ng(t) = (1 - 2\\lambda t) g_{0}\n$$\nThis solution is valid as long as $g(t)$ remains a Riemannian metric, which requires the scaling factor to be positive, i.e., $1 - 2\\lambda t  0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the first singularity time $t_{\\ast}$ for the case where $\\lambda  0$.

Task A requires the derivation of the relationship between the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$, the scalar curvature $R$, and the metric tensor $g$ in dimension $2$. Task B asks to rewrite the Ricci flow equation for a conformally evolving metric as a scalar partial differential equation (PDE).\n\n**Task A: Verification of $\\operatorname{Ric} = \\frac{1}{2} R\\, g$ in dimension $2$**\n\nWe begin by establishing our conventions based on foundational principles as requested. Let $(M, g)$ be a smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension $n=2$. In local coordinates $\\{x^i\\}$, we denote the metric tensor components by $g_{ij}$.\n\nThe Riemann curvature endomorphism is given by $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$ for vector fields $X$, $Y$, $Z$. Its components are defined by $R(\\partial_j, \\partial_k)\\partial_l = R^i_{~l j k} \\partial_i$.\nThe $(0,4)$ Riemann curvature tensor is obtained by lowering the first index: $R_{i l j k} = g_{im} R^m_{~l j k}$.\nThe Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is obtained by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor. We define its components as $R_{jk} = R^i_{~j i k}$. This is a trace of the map $Y \\mapsto R(Y, \\partial_j) \\partial_k$.\nThe scalar curvature $R$ is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric: $R = g^{jk}R_{jk}$.\n\nThe problem states that on a $2$-dimensional manifold, the Riemann curvature tensor is determined at each point by a single scalar function, the Gaussian curvature, which we denote by $K$. The component form of the $(0,4)$ Riemann tensor consistent with the above definitions is:\n$$R_{ijkl} = K (g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$$\nFrom this, we can raise an index to find the components $R^i_{~jkl}$:\n$$R^i_{~jkl} = g^{im}R_{mjkl} = g^{im}K(g_{mk}g_{jl} - g_{ml}g_{jk}) = K(g^{im}g_{mk}g_{jl} - g^{im}g_{ml}g_{jk})$$\nUsing the property $g^{im}g_{mk} = \\delta^i_k$ and $g^{im}g_{ml} = \\delta^i_l$, where $\\delta^i_j$ is the Kronecker delta, we have:\n$$R^i_{~jkl} = K(\\delta^i_k g_{jl} - \\delta^i_l g_{jk})$$\nNow, we compute the components of the Ricci tensor $R_{jk}$ by applying our definition, which involves a contraction over the first and third indices of $R^i_{~jkl}$:\n$$R_{jk} = R^i_{~j i k} = K(\\delta^i_i g_{jk} - \\delta^i_k g_{ji})$$\nThe summation over the index $i$ is implied. The term $\\delta^i_i$ is the trace of the identity matrix, which equals the dimension of the manifold, $n=2$. The term $\\delta^i_k g_{ji}$ simplifies to $g_{jk}$. Substituting these results, we get:\n$$R_{jk} = K(n g_{jk} - g_{jk}) = K((n-1)g_{jk})$$\nSince we are in dimension $n=2$:\n$$R_{jk} = K( (2-1)g_{jk} ) = K g_{jk}$$\nIn tensor notation, this is $\\operatorname{Ric} = K g$.\n\nNext, we find the relationship between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the scalar curvature $R$. We take the trace of the Ricci tensor:\n$$R = g^{jk}R_{jk} = g^{jk}(K g_{jk}) = K (g^{jk}g_{jk})$$\nThe term $g^{jk}g_{jk}$ is the trace of the identity matrix, which is the dimension $n=2$. Thus:\n$$R = 2K$$\nThis gives us an expression for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the scalar curvature: $K = \\frac{1}{2} R$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $K$ back into our equation for the Ricci tensor:\n$$R_{jk} = K g_{jk} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} R\\right) g_{jk}$$\nThis verifies the identity $\\operatorname{Ric} = \\frac{1}{2} R g$ in dimension $2$, derived from the specified foundational principles.\n\n**Task B: Derivation of the Scalar PDE for Ricci Flow**\n\nWe are given a family of metrics $g(t)$ on the $2$-manifold $M$ evolving by the Ricci flow equation:\n$$\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$$\nUsing the identity from Task A, $\\operatorname{Ric} = \\frac{1}{2} R g$, we can simplify the Ricci flow equation in dimension $2$:\n$$\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} R(t) g(t)\\right) = -R(t) g(t)$$\nIn local coordinates, this reads $\\partial_t g_{ij} = -R g_{ij}$.\n\nWe are given that the metric remains in a fixed conformal class, so $g(t) = \\exp(2u(\\cdot,t)) g_0$, where $g_0$ is a fixed background metric and $u$ is a smooth scalar function. In components, $g_{ij}(t) = \\exp(2u(x,t)) (g_0)_{ij}(x)$.\n\nLet us compute the left-hand side of the flow equation. The background metric $g_0$ is independent of time $t$, so $\\partial_t (g_0)_{ij} = 0$.\n$$\\partial_t g_{ij} = \\partial_t \\left( \\exp(2u) (g_0)_{ij} \\right) = (g_0)_{ij} \\cdot \\partial_t(\\exp(2u)) = (g_0)_{ij} \\cdot \\exp(2u) \\cdot 2 \\partial_t u$$\nSince $g_{ij} = \\exp(2u) (g_0)_{ij}$, we can write this as:\n$$\\partial_t g_{ij} = 2 (\\partial_t u) g_{ij}$$\nEquating this with the right-hand side of the simplified flow equation, $-R g_{ij}$:\n$$2 (\\partial_t u) g_{ij} = -R g_{ij}$$\nThis implies a scalar equation for the evolution of $u$:\n$$\\partial_t u = -\\frac{1}{2} R$$\nTo complete the task, we must express the scalar curvature $R$ of the metric $g(t)$ in terms of the function $u$ and quantities associated with the fixed background metric $g_0$. The problem permits the use of standard facts about conformal transformations. For a conformal change of metric $g = \\exp(2u) g_0$ on a manifold of dimension $n$, the scalar curvatures are related by the formula:\n$$R = \\exp(-2u) \\left( R_{g_0} - 2(n-1)\\Delta_{g_0} u - (n-1)(n-2) |\\nabla_{g_0}u|^2_{g_0} \\right)$$\nHere, $R_{g_0}$ is the scalar curvature of $g_0$, and $\\Delta_{g_0}$ and $\\nabla_{g_0}$ are the Laplace–Beltrami operator and gradient operator with respect to $g_0$.\n\nIn our case, the dimension is $n=2$, which leads to a significant simplification as the gradient term vanishes:\n$$R = \\exp(-2u) \\left( R_{g_0} - 2(2-1)\\Delta_{g_0} u - (2-1)(2-2) |\\nabla_{g_0}u|^2_{g_0} \\right)$$\n$$R = \\exp(-2u) \\left( R_{g_0} - 2\\Delta_{g_0} u \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $R$ into our evolution equation for $u$:\n$$\\partial_t u = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\exp(-2u) \\left( R_{g_0} - 2\\Delta_{g_0} u \\right) \\right]$$\nDistributing the factor of $-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\\partial_t u = -\\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-2u) R_{g_0} + \\exp(-2u) \\Delta_{g_0} u$$\nThe problem asks for the explicit right-hand side expression for $\\partial_t u$. Reordering the terms, this is:\n$$\\exp(-2u) \\Delta_{g_0} u - \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-2u) R_{g_0}$$\nThis is the final expression for the evolution of the conformal factor $u$ under Ricci flow on a $2$-dimensional manifold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp(-2u)\\Delta_{g_{0}}u - \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2u)R_{g_{0}}}$$", "id": "3065087"}, {"introduction": "The proof of short-time existence for Ricci flow hinges on its character as a parabolic, or 'heat-type', equation, a property that is obscured by the equation's geometric nature.
