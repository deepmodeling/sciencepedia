All concepts—Ricci flow, Riemannian metric, geodesic distance, Levi-Civita connection, and curvature tensors—are standard. The scaling properties of the Ricci flow are a fundamental aspect of its study, particularly in the analysis of singularities. The premises are scientifically sound and internally consistent. The problem asks for a derivation based on these premises, which is a standard procedure in theoretical physics and mathematics. The slight ambiguity in the phrasing of \"derive how ... the time parameter must be rescaled under $t \\mapsto \\lambda t$\" is resolved by interpreting the task as verifying that the given scaling is the correct one for invariance. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\n#### Part 1: Scaling of Geodesic Distances\nThe geodesic distance $d_g(p, q)$ between two points $p, q \\in M$ with respect to a metric $g$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting $p$ and $q$:\n$$\nd_g(p, q) = \\inf_{\\gamma} \\{L_g(\\gamma) \\mid \\gamma(a)=p, \\gamma(b)=q\\}\n$$\nThe length of a curve $\\gamma$ is given by $L_g(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(s)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))} \\, ds$.\n\nWe consider the rescaled metric $\\tilde{g} = \\lambda g$, where $\\lambda  0$ is a constant. The length of the same curve $\\gamma$ with respect to $\\tilde{g}$ is:\n$$\nL_{\\tilde{g}}(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\tilde{g}_{\\gamma(s)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))} \\, ds\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tilde{g} = \\lambda g$:\n$$\nL_{\\tilde{g}}(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{(\\lambda g)_{\\gamma(s)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))} \\, ds = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\lambda \\, g_{\\gamma(s)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))} \\, ds\n$$\nSince $\\lambda$ is a positive constant, we can factor it out of the square root and the integral:\n$$\nL_{\\tilde{g}}(\\gamma) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(s)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))} \\, ds = \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\, L_g(\\gamma)\n$$\nThe geodesic distance $d_{\\tilde{g}}(p, q)$ is the infimum of these new lengths. Since $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ is a positive constant, taking the infimum over all curves $\\gamma$ yields:\n$$\nd_{\\tilde{g}}(p, q) = \\inf_{\\gamma} \\{L_{\\tilde{g}}(\\gamma)\\} = \\inf_{\\gamma} \\{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\, L_g(\\gamma)\\} = \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\, \\inf_{\\gamma} \\{L_g(\\gamma)\\} = \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\, d_g(p, q)\n$$\nThus, under the metric scaling $g \\mapsto \\lambda g$, distances scale by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$. The multiplicative scaling factor for distances is $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Invariance of the Ricci Flow Equation\nThe original family of metrics $g(t)$ satisfies the Ricci flow equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = -2 \\, \\mathrm{Ric}(g)\n$$\nWe have a rescaled family $\\tilde{g}(\\tau) = \\lambda g(t)$ with a new time parameter $\\tau$. We need to find the relationship between $\\tau$ and $t$ such that $\\tilde{g}(\\tau)$ satisfies an equation of the same form:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}}{\\partial \\tau} = -2 \\, \\mathrm{Ric}(\\tilde{g})\n$$\nLet's analyze the two sides of this target equation separately.\n\n**Right-Hand Side: Scaling of the Ricci Tensor**\nThe problem states that the Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant scaling of the metric. Let's briefly verify this. The Christoffel symbols for $\\tilde{g} = \\lambda g$ are:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{g}^{kl}(\\partial_i \\tilde{g}_{jl} + \\partial_j \\tilde{g}_{il} - \\partial_l \\tilde{g}_{ij})\n$$\nSince $\\tilde{g}_{ab} = \\lambda g_{ab}$ and $\\tilde{g}^{ab} = \\lambda^{-1} g^{ab}$, we have:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^{-1}g^{kl})(\\lambda\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\lambda\\partial_j g_{il} - \\lambda\\partial_l g_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}(\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij}) = \\Gamma^k_{ij}\n$$\nThe Christoffel symbols are indeed invariant. The components of the Riemann curvature tensor of type $(1,3)$, $R^l_{ijk}$, are defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives. Since $\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\Gamma^k_{ij}$, it follows that the $(1,3)$-Riemann tensor is also invariant:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}^l_{ijk} = R^l_{ijk}\n$$\nThe Ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the first and third indices of the Riemann tensor, $R_{ik} = R^j_{ijk}$. Therefore, the components of the Ricci tensor are also invariant under this scaling:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}_{ik} = \\tilde{R}^j_{ijk} = R^j_{ijk} = R_{ik}\n$$\nThis means that the Ricci tensor itself, as a $(0,2)$-tensor field, is invariant under constant conformal scaling:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\tilde{g}) = \\mathrm{Ric}(g)\n$$\n\n**Left-Hand Side: The Time Derivative**\nNow we examine the time derivative term, $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}}{\\partial \\tau}$. We are given $\\tilde{g}(\\tau) = \\lambda g(t)$, where $\\tau$ is a function of $t$. We can use the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{d}{d\\tau}(\\lambda g(t)) = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial g(t)}{\\partial t} \\frac{dt}{d\\tau}\n$$\nWe know that $g(t)$ is a solution to the Ricci flow, so $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = -2 \\, \\mathrm{Ric}(g)$. Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}}{\\partial \\tau} = \\lambda (-2 \\, \\mathrm{Ric}(g)) \\frac{dt}{d\\tau}\n$$\nNow, we use our result from the RHS analysis, $\\mathrm{Ric}(g) = \\mathrm{Ric}(\\tilde{g})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}}{\\partial \\tau} = -2 \\lambda \\left(\\frac{dt}{d\\tau}\\right) \\mathrm{Ric}(\\tilde{g})\n$$\nFor the Ricci flow equation to be invariant in form for $\\tilde{g}(\\tau)$, we must have $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}}{\\partial \\tau} = -2 \\, \\mathrm{Ric}(\\tilde{g})$. Comparing this with the expression we derived, we must satisfy the condition:\n$$\n\\lambda \\frac{dt}{d\\tau} = 1\n$$\nThis implies $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\lambda$. Integrating with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\lambda t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an integration constant. It is conventional to set the initial times to be zero, i.e., $\\tau(0)=0$ when $t=0$, which implies $C=0$. Thus, the required time rescaling is $\\tau = \\lambda t$. This confirms that the time scaling given in the problem statement, $\\tau = \\lambda t$, is precisely the one needed to maintain the form of the Ricci flow equation. The multiplicative scaling factor for time is $\\lambda$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTo ensure the Ricci flow equation remains invariant in form under the metric rescaling $\\tilde{g} = \\lambda g$, the distance must scale by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ and the time parameter must scale by a factor of $\\lambda$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the distance scaling factor and the time scaling factor, in that order.\nDistance scaling factor: $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$.\nTime scaling factor: $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sqrt{\\lambda}  \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3065367"}, {"introduction": "Ricci solitons are special solutions to the Ricci flow that serve as models for the geometry near a singularity, defined by a delicate balance between the Ricci curvature and the Hessian of a potential function.

First, we must compute the Hessian of the function $f$ on $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}})$ and verify it is equal to $\\lambda g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}$. Second, we use this result to find the constant $\\rho$ in the gradient Ricci soliton equation.\n\nLet's work in the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The coordinate basis vector fields are $\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$. In these coordinates, the Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}$ has components $(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}})_{ij} = g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}(\\partial_i, \\partial_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe problem states that the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ for $g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}$ is the standard directional derivative. This implies that the Christoffel symbols of the connection, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, are all zero in Cartesian coordinates. A direct consequence is that the covariant derivative of a basis vector field along another is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_i}\\partial_j = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\partial_k = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the Hessian tensor $\\nabla^2 f$. Its components in our coordinate basis are $(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\nabla^2 f(\\partial_i, \\partial_j)$.

As the components are identical in this coordinate system, the tensors are equal:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 f = \\lambda g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\n$$\nThis completes the verification part of the problem.\n\nNext, we determine the value of $\\rho$ for the gradient Ricci soliton equation:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} + \\nabla^2 f = \\rho g\n$$\nIn our case, the metric is $g = g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}$ and the function is $f(x) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} |x|^2$.

That is, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting this and our result for the Hessian into the soliton equation gives:\n$$\n0 + \\lambda g_{\\mathrm{Euc}} = \\rho g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\lambda g_{\\mathrm{Euc}} = \\rho g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\n$$\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}$ is a non-degenerate bilinear form, so it is not the zero tensor.

Derivation and Solution of the ODE for $c(t)$**\n\nThe Ricci flow equation is given by\n$$\n\\partial_t g(t) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nWe are given that the solution takes the form $g(t) = c(t) g_0$, where $c(t)$ is a time-dependent scaling factor and $g_0$ is the time-independent round metric on $S^n$. The left-hand side of the Ricci flow equation becomes:\n$$\n\\partial_t g(t) = \\partial_t (c(t) g_0) = \\frac{dc}{dt} g_0 = c'(t) g_0\n$$\nFor the right-hand side, we need to compute the Ricci tensor of $g(t) = c(t) g_0$. The Ricci tensor scales under a constant conformal change of metric $\\tilde{g} = a g$ (for constant $a0$) as $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g}) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g)$. This is because the Christoffel symbols are invariant, $\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\Gamma^k_{ij}$, which implies the Riemann tensor with one contravariant and three covariant indices is invariant, $\\tilde{R}^k_{lij} = R^k_{lij}$. The Ricci tensor components are then $\\tilde{R}_{ij} = \\tilde{R}^k_{ikj} = R^k_{ikj} = R_{ij}$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\operatorname{Ric}(c(t) g_0) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g_0)$.\n\nWe are given that $\\operatorname{Ric}(g_0) = (n-1)g_0$. Substituting this into the right-hand side of the Ricci flow equation, we get:\n$$\n-2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g_0) = -2(n-1)g_0\n$$\nEquating the left-hand and right-hand sides gives:\n$$\nc'(t) g_0 = -2(n-1)g_0\n$$\nThis implies that the scale factor $c(t)$ must satisfy the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = -2(n-1)\n$$\nThis is a simple linear ODE. We solve it by direct integration:\n$$\n\\int dc = \\int -2(n-1) dt\n$$\n$$\nc(t) = -2(n-1)t + K\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration.

The explicit solution for the scale factor is:\n$$\nc(t) = c_0 - 2(n-1)t\n$$\n\n**2. Determination of the Extinction Time $T$**\n\nThe metric $g(t) = c(t) g_0$ degenerates to a zero tensor when the scale factor $c(t)$ becomes zero. This time is called the extinction time, denoted by $T$. We find $T$ by setting $c(T)=0$:\n$$\nc(T) = c_0 - 2(n-1)T = 0\n$$\nSolving for $T$, we find:\n$$\nT = \\frac{c_0}{2(n-1)}\n$$\nSince $c_0  0$ and $n \\ge 2$, the extinction time $T$ is finite and positive.\n\n**3. Type I Singularity Verification**\n\nTo verify that the singularity at $t=T$ is Type I, we must analyze the behavior of the curvature as $t \\to T^-$. The metric $g_0$ has constant sectional curvature $\\kappa_0 = 1$. Under a scaling of the metric $\\tilde{g} = c g$, the sectional curvature scales as $\\tilde{\\kappa} = \\frac{1}{c} \\kappa$. Therefore, the metric $g(t) = c(t) g_0$ has constant sectional curvature $\\kappa(t)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(t) = \\frac{1}{c(t)} \\kappa_0 = \\frac{1}{c(t)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the formula for the squared norm of the Riemann curvature tensor for a metric with constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$: $|\\operatorname{Rm}|^2 = 2n(n-1)\\kappa^2$. The norm is taken with respect to the metric itself. For our metric $g(t)$, this becomes:\n$$\n|\\operatorname{Rm}(g(t))|^2_{g(t)} = 2n(n-1)[\\kappa(t)]^2 = \\frac{2n(n-1)}{c(t)^2}\n$$\nTaking the square root, and noting that since the curvature is constant over the sphere $S^n$, the supremum is just the value itself:\n$$\n\\sup_{S^n} |\\operatorname{Rm}(g(t))| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2n(n-1)}}{c(t)}\n$$\nNow, we express $c(t)$ in terms of the extinction time $T$. From $T = \\frac{c_0}{2(n-1)}$, we have $c_0 = 2(n-1)T$. Substituting this into the solution for $c(t)$:\n$$\nc(t) = c_0 - 2(n-1)t = 2(n-1)T - 2(n-1)t = 2(n-1)(T-t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the curvature norm:\n$$\n\\sup_{S^n} |\\operatorname{Rm}(g(t))| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2n(n-1)}}{2(n-1)(T-t)} = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2n(n-1)}}{2(n-1)} \\right) \\frac{1}{T-t}\n$$\nThis is of the form $\\frac{C}{T-t}$, which verifies the Type I singularity condition, with the constant $C$ given by:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\sqrt{2n(n-1)}}{2(n-1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2n}}{\\sqrt{4(n-1)^2/(n-1)}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2n}}{2\\sqrt{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2(n-1)}}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the required limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to T^{-}} (T - t) \\sup_{S^{n}} | \\operatorname{Rm}(g(t)) | = \\lim_{t \\to T^{-}} (T - t) \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2n(n-1)}}{2(n-1)(T-t)} \\right)\n$$\nFor $t  T$, the $(T-t)$ terms cancel, leaving a constant value. The limit is therefore:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to T^{-}} (T - t) \\sup_{S^{n}} | \\operatorname{Rm}(g(t)) | = \\frac{\\sqrt{2n(n-1)}}{2(n-1)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2(n-1)}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the exact closed-form expression for the extinction time $T$. As derived in part 2, this is $T = \\frac{c_0}{2(n-1)}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{c_{0}}{2(n-1)}}\n$$", "id": "3065345"}]}
