The condition is $df_{(x,y)} \\circ J = J \\circ df_{(x,y)}$. In terms of matrix multiplication, this is $df_{(x,y)} \\cdot J = J \\cdot df_{(x,y)}$. We are given the matrix for $J$:\n$$J=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe compute the two matrix products separately.\n\nFirst, we compute $df_{(x,y)} \\cdot J$:\n$$ df_{(x,y)} \\cdot J = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & -2y \\\\ 2y & 2x \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (2x)(0) + (-2y)(1) & (2x)(-1) + (-2y)(0) \\\\ (2y)(0) + (2x)(1) & (2y)(-1) + (2x)(0) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ df_{(x,y)} \\cdot J = \\begin{pmatrix} -2y & -2x \\\\ 2x & -2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we compute $J \\cdot df_{(x,y)}$:\n$$ J \\cdot df_{(x,y)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & -2y \\\\ 2y & 2x \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(2x) + (-1)(2y) & (0)(-2y) + (-1)(2x) \\\\ (1)(2x) + (0)(2y) & (1)(-2y) + (0)(2x) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ J \\cdot df_{(x,y)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2y & -2x \\\\ 2x & -2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nComparing the two results, we see that $df_{(x,y)} \\cdot J = J \\cdot df_{(x,y)}$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. This verifies that the holomorphicity condition holds, as required.
