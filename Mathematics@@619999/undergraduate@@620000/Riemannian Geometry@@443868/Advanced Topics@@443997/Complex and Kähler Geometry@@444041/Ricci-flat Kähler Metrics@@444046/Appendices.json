We apply the exterior derivative $d$:\n$$d\\omega = d\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}\\right)$$\nSince the coefficient $\\frac{i}{2}$ is constant and $d$ is linear, we can move it outside the sum:\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} d(dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j})$$\nUsing the product rule for exterior derivatives, $d(A \\wedge B) = dA \\wedge B + (-1)^{\\deg A} A \\wedge dB$:\n$$d(dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}) = d(dz^{j}) \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j} - dz^{j} \\wedge d(d\\bar{z}^{j})$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that it is nilpotent, i.e., $d^2 = 0$. Since $dz^j = d(z^j)$ and $d\\bar{z}^j = d(\\bar{z}^j)$, we have:\n$$d(dz^{j}) = d^2(z^j) = 0$$\n$$d(d\\bar{z}^{j}) = d^2(\\bar{z}^j) = 0$$\nTherefore, for each $j$:\n$$d(dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}) = 0 \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j} - dz^{j} \\wedge 0 = 0$$\nThis leads to the conclusion that $d\\omega = 0$, so the Kähler form is closed.\n\nThe expression for the Kähler form in complex coordinates is thus $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}$.
