No numerical approximation is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the holomorphic sectional curvature $H(v)$ for the standard flat Kähler metric on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, using only fundamental definitions.\n\nFirst, we establish the coordinate system and the metric tensor. The space $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ using the coordinates $z^{k} = x^{k} + i y^{k}$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. We can define a single set of real coordinates $(\\xi^{1}, \\xi^{2}, \\dots, \\xi^{2n-1}, \\xi^{2n})$ by setting $\\xi^{2k-1} = x^{k}$ and $\\xi^{2k} = y^{k}$. The given Riemannian metric is $g=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\left((dx^{k})^{2}+(dy^{k})^{2}\\right)$, which in the $\\xi$ coordinates becomes $g = \\sum_{j=1}^{2n} (d\\xi^{j})^{2}$. The components of the metric tensor $g$ in this coordinate system are therefore given by $g_{ij} = g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\xi^{i}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\xi^{j}}) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The components of the inverse metric are $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$.\n\nNext, we compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, for the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. The formula for the Christoffel symbols is:\n$$ \\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial \\xi^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{li}}{\\partial \\xi^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial \\xi^l} \\right) $$\nSince the metric components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constants, all their partial derivatives are zero, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial \\xi^l} = 0$ for all $i, j, l$. Substituting this into the formula yields:\n$$ \\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 $$\nThus, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\n\nNow, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor, whose components $R^l_{ijk}$ in a coordinate basis are given by the formula:\n$$ R^l_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ik}}{\\partial \\xi^j} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ij}}{\\partial \\xi^k} + \\sum_{m=1}^{2n} (\\Gamma^m_{ik} \\Gamma^l_{mj} - \\Gamma^m_{ij} \\Gamma^l_{mk}) $$\nSince all the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero, their partial derivatives are also zero. Consequently, every term on the right-hand side of the equation is zero.\n$$ R^l_{ijk} = 0 - 0 + \\sum_{m=1}^{2n} (0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0) = 0 $$\nThis demonstrates that all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero. Therefore, the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero, meaning $R(X,Y)Z = 0$ for any vector fields $X, Y, Z$.\n\nThe sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of a $2$-dimensional plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p \\mathbb{C}^n$ spanned by two linearly independent vectors $u, w$ is defined as:\n$$ K(u,w) = \\frac{g(R(u,w)w, u)}{g(u,u)g(w,w) - g(u,w)^2} $$\nThe problem defines the holomorphic sectional curvature $H(v)$ for a nonzero tangent vector $v \\in T_p \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ as the sectional curvature of the real $2$-plane spanned by $v$ and $Jv$, where $J$ is the standard complex structure. Thus, we set $u=v$ and $w=Jv$:\n$$ H(v) = K(v, Jv) = \\frac{g(R(v,Jv)Jv, v)}{g(v,v)g(Jv,Jv) - g(v,Jv)^2} $$\nWe have already shown that the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero. This implies that the numerator of the expression for $H(v)$ is zero:\n$$ g(R(v,Jv)Jv, v) = g(0, v) = 0 $$\nFor the expression to be well-defined, the denominator must be non-zero. Since $v$ is a nonzero vector, $g(v,v) = \\|v\\|^2 > 0$. The metric $g$ on a Kähler manifold is a Hermitian metric, which means it is compatible with the complex structure $J$, i.e., $g(JX, JY) = g(X,Y)$ for any vectors $X, Y$. Applying this property, we have $g(Jv, Jv) = g(v,v) = \\|v\\|^2$.\nFurthermore, for a Kähler metric, $v$ and $Jv$ are orthogonal. We can show this from the compatibility condition: $g(v, Jv) = g(Jv, J(Jv)) = g(Jv, -v) = -g(Jv, v)$. Since $g$ is symmetric, $g(v, Jv) = g(Jv, v)$, so we must have $g(v, Jv) = -g(v, Jv)$, which implies $g(v, Jv) = 0$.\nThe denominator is therefore:\n$$ g(v,v)g(Jv,Jv) - g(v,Jv)^2 = (\\|v\\|^2)(\\|v\\|^2) - 0^2 = \\|v\\|^4 $$\nSince $v \\neq 0$, the denominator is strictly positive, and the vectors $v$ and $Jv$ are linearly independent, spanning a well-defined $2$-plane.\nFinally, we compute the holomorphic sectional curvature:\n$$ H(v) = \\frac{0}{\\|v\\|^4} = 0 $$\nThe holomorphic sectional curvature for the standard flat Kähler metric on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is $0$ for any nonzero vector $v$.

The task is to show that this curvature is constant and positive.\n\nOur first step is to establish the relationship between the holomorphic sectional curvature $H(v)$ and the Gaussian curvature $K_G$ for a complex manifold of dimension $1$ (a real surface). The holomorphic sectional curvature for a nonzero tangent vector $v$ is defined as $H(v) = \\frac{R(v, Jv, v, Jv)}{|v|^{4}}$, where $R$ is the Riemannian curvature tensor, $J$ is the complex structure, and $|\\cdot|$ is the metric-induced norm. The notation $R(v, Jv, v, Jv)$ denotes $g(R(v,Jv)v, Jv)$. For any $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the curvature tensor can be expressed entirely in terms of the Gaussian curvature $K_G$ and the metric tensor $g$ via the formula:\n$$\nR(X,Y,Z,W) = K_G (g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W))\n$$\nfor any tangent vectors $X, Y, Z, W$. Let us apply this identity to compute the numerator of $H(v)$:\n$$\nR(v, Jv, v, Jv) = K_G (g(v,Jv)g(Jv,v) - g(v,v)g(Jv,Jv))\n$$\nSince the metric is Kähler, it is compatible with the complex structure, which implies two conditions: first, $J$ is an isometry, so $|Jv|^2 = g(Jv,Jv) = g(v,v) = |v|^2$; second, the metric is Hermitian, which means $g(v,Jv) = 0$ for any vector $v$. Substituting these properties into the equation gives:\n$$\nR(v, Jv, v, Jv) = K_G (0 - |v|^2 |v|^2) = -K_G|v|^4\n$$\nThere appears to be a sign inconsistency stemming from differing conventions in the literature. A more direct definition for the holomorphic sectional curvature, equivalent to the one given, relates it to the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by $\\{v, Jv \\}$. For a Kähler manifold, the sectional curvature $K(v,Jv)$ of the plane spanned by $v$ and $Jv$ is given by $K(v,Jv) = \\frac{R(v,Jv,v,Jv)}{g(v,v)g(Jv,Jv) - g(v,Jv)^2} = \\frac{R(v,Jv,v,Jv)}{|v|^4}$. Thus, $H(v) = K(v,Jv)$. For a $2$-dimensional manifold, the sectional curvature is independent of the chosen plane at a point and is equal to the Gaussian curvature $K_G$. Therefore, for $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$, we have $H(v) = K_G$. Our task reduces to computing the Gaussian curvature of the specified metric.\n\nThe problem defines the Hermitian component of the metric as $h_{z\\bar z} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}K}{\\partial z \\,\\partial \\bar z}$.
