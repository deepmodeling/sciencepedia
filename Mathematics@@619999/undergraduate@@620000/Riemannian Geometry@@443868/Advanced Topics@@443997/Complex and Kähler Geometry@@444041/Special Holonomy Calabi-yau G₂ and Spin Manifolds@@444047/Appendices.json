A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe holonomy group of a connected Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ at a point $p \\in M$, denoted $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M)$, is the subgroup of the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(T_pM)$ generated by parallel transport of tangent vectors along all closed loops based at $p$. If $M$ is orientable, $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M) \\subseteq \\mathrm{SO}(T_pM)$. We assume $n \\ge 2$, for which $S^n$ and $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ are simply connected, implying their holonomy groups are connected.\n\n**Holonomy Group of $S^n$**\nThe $n$-sphere $S^n$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=+1$. The Riemann curvature tensor for such a space is given by\n$$R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)$$\nfor any vector fields $X, Y, Z$. At a point $p \\in S^n$, the curvature endomorphisms are the linear maps $R_{XY}: T_pS^n \\to T_pS^n$ defined by $R_{XY}(Z) = R(X,Y)Z$. The Ambrose–Singer theorem states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group, $\\mathfrak{hol}(S^n)$, is spanned by all such curvature endomorphisms $R_{XY}$ for $X,Y \\in T_pS^n$.\n\nLet $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_pS^n$. For any pair of distinct basis vectors $e_i, e_j$, the curvature endomorphism $R_{e_i, e_j}$ acts as:\n$$R_{e_i, e_j}(Z) = \\langle e_j, Z \\rangle e_i - \\langle e_i, Z \\rangle e_j$$\nThis operator maps $e_j \\to e_i$, $e_i \\to -e_j$, and $e_k \\to 0$ for $k \\ne i,j$. In matrix form relative to this basis, $R_{e_i, e_j}$ is a skew-symmetric matrix with a $1$ in the $(i,j)$ entry and a $-1$ in the $(j,i)$ entry, and zeros elsewhere. The set of all such matrices $\\{E_{ij} - E_{ji} \\mid 1 \\le i < j \\le n\\}$ forms a basis for the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ of skew-symmetric $n \\times n$ matrices. Since the curvature endomorphisms span $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$, the holonomy Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{hol}(S^n) = \\mathfrak{so}(n)$.\nSince $S^n$ is simply connected for $n \\ge 2$, its holonomy group is the connected Lie group corresponding to $\\mathfrak{hol}(S^n)$, which is the special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$. For $n=1$, $S^1$ is flat, so its holonomy is trivial, which is $\\mathrm{SO}(1)$. Thus, for all $n \\ge 1$, $\\mathrm{Hol}(S^n) = \\mathrm{SO}(n)$.\n\n**Holonomy Group of $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$**\nComplex projective space $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ is a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$, and thus a real manifold of dimension $2n$. The Fubini–Study metric is a Kähler metric. A key property of a Kähler manifold is that its Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is compatible with the complex structure $J$, meaning $\\nabla J = 0$. This implies that parallel transport along any curve commutes with $J$. Consequently, all holonomy transformations must be complex-linear isometries. The group of real-linear isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ that commute with a compatible complex structure is the unitary group $\\mathrm{U}(n)$. Therefore, the holonomy group of $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ must be a subgroup of $\\mathrm{U}(n)$: $\\mathrm{Hol}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(n)$.\n\nTo show equality, we note that $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ is an irreducible Riemannian symmetric space, which can be represented as the quotient $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n \\cong \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)/\\mathrm{S}(\\mathrm{U}(n)\\times\\mathrm{U}(1))$. For any irreducible symmetric space $G/K$, the holonomy group is precisely $K$. In this case, the isotropy group $K = \\mathrm{S}(\\mathrm{U}(n)\\times\\mathrm{U}(1))$ is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{U}(n)$. As $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ is simply connected, its holonomy group is connected, and $\\mathrm{U}(n)$ is connected. Thus, we conclude that $\\mathrm{Hol}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n) = \\mathrm{U}(n)$.\n\n**Parallel Spinors on $S^n$ and $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$**\nThe existence of a parallel spinor field $\\psi$ (i.e., a spinor field satisfying $\\nabla_X\\psi = 0$ for all vectors $X$) on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is severely constrained by its curvature. The integrability condition for the existence of such a spinor is that the curvature must annihilate it. A key consequence, derived from the Weitzenböck-Lichnerowicz formula for the square of the Dirac operator $D^2 = \\nabla^*\\nabla + \\frac{1}{4}R$, is that for a parallel spinor field $\\psi$, it must hold that $R\\psi=0$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature of the manifold. If the scalar curvature $R$ is non-zero, this equation forces $\\psi=0$.\n\nFor the $n$-sphere $S^n$ with constant sectional curvature $K=+1$, the Ricci tensor is $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)g$, and the scalar curvature is $R = n(n-1)$. For $n \\ge 2$, $R > 0$. Since $R \\ne 0$, any parallel spinor on $S^n$ must be the zero spinor. Therefore, the dimension of the space of parallel spinors is $\\dim \\mathcal{P}(S^n) = 0$.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ with a standard Fubini–Study metric, the manifold is Kähler-Einstein with a positive Einstein constant, meaning $\\mathrm{Ric} = \\lambda g$ for some $\\lambda > 0$. Specifically, for a normalization giving minimal holomorphic sectional curvature $1$, the scalar curvature is $R = 2n(n+1)$. Since $n\\ge 1$, we have $R > 0$. Again, the condition $R\\psi=0$ implies that any parallel spinor must be identically zero. This holds for odd $n$ where $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ is a spin manifold. For even $n$, $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ is not spin, so the space of spinors is not defined, and the dimension is taken to be $0$ as per the problem statement. In all cases, $\\dim \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n) = 0$.\n\n**Absence of Special Holonomy**\nThe problem defines \"special holonomy\" as a reduction of the holonomy group that permits the existence of parallel spinors. This corresponds to the holonomy groups on Berger's list for non-symmetric, irreducible, simply connected manifolds: $\\mathrm{SU}(m)$, $\\mathrm{Sp}(m)$, $G_2$, and $\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$. A necessary condition for a manifold to have such holonomy is that it must be Ricci-flat. A Ricci-flat manifold has zero scalar curvature, $R=0$, which is the necessary condition for the existence of non-trivial parallel spinors we used above.\n\nNeither $S^n$ nor $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ has this type of special holonomy.\n- $S^n$: Its holonomy group is $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$, the generic group for an orientable $n$-manifold, which is not on the special holonomy list. More fundamentally, its scalar curvature is $R=n(n-1) > 0$. Since it is not Ricci-flat, it cannot have any of the special holonomy groups listed, and as shown, it does not admit parallel spinors.\n- $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$: Its holonomy group is $\\mathrm{U}(n)$, the generic group for a Kähler $n$-manifold. While this is a reduction from $\\mathrm{SO}(2n)$, it is not on the list of groups admitting parallel spinors. A Calabi-Yau manifold is a Kähler manifold whose holonomy is further reduced from $\\mathrm{U}(n)$ to $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$, which requires the manifold to be Ricci-flat. $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ has positive scalar curvature $R>0$ and is not Ricci-flat. Therefore, its holonomy is not contained in $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$, and as shown, it does not admit parallel spinors.\n\nIn conclusion, the facts that $\\mathrm{Hol}(S^n) = \\mathrm{SO}(n)$ and $\\mathrm{Hol}(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n) = \\mathrm{U}(n)$, and that both manifolds have strictly positive scalar curvature, preclude them from having special holonomy in the sense of admitting parallel spinors.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathrm{SO}(n) & \\mathrm{U}(n) & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3066313"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the generic holonomy group for a complex manifold of dimension $n$ is $\\mathrm{U}(n)$, we now explore the conditions required to reduce it to the special unitary group $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$.

The space is $\\mathbb{R}^{6}$ with coordinates $(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{6})$. The standard Euclidean metric $g$ is given by $g = \\sum_{j=1}^{6} (dx^{j})^{2}$. In the basis of coordinate vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\}_{j=1}^{6}$, the metric acts as $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}) = \\delta_{jk}$, where $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe complex structure $J$ is induced by the identification $z^{k} = x^{2k-1} + \\mathrm{i}\\,x^{2k}$, where $\\mathrm{i}^{2}=-1$. Multiplication by $\\mathrm{i}$ on $z^{k}$ yields $\\mathrm{i}z^{k} = \\mathrm{i}(x^{2k-1} + \\mathrm{i}\\,x^{2k}) = -x^{2k} + \\mathrm{i}\\,x^{2k-1}$. This corresponds to a linear transformation on the real coordinates $(x^{2k-1}, x^{2k}) \\mapsto (-x^{2k}, x^{2k-1})$. The action of $J$ on the basis vectors is therefore:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\n$$\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\n$$\nfor $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe Kähler form $\\omega$ is a $2$-form defined by $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y)$. We compute its components $\\omega_{jk} = \\omega(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}})$.\nFor any fixed $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{2k-1, 2k} = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{2k, 2k-1} = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\\right) = g\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\\right) = -1\n$$\nAll other components $\\omega_{jk}$ are zero. For instance, if the indices $j,k$ belong to different blocks (e.g., $j \\in \\{1,2\\}, k \\in \\{3,4\\}$) or are both odd or both even, the result is zero.\nFrom these components, the Kähler form $\\omega$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} dx^{2k-1} \\wedge dx^{2k} = dx^{1} \\wedge dx^{2} + dx^{3} \\wedge dx^{4} + dx^{5} \\wedge dx^{6}\n$$\nThis is the explicit form of $\\omega$ that constitutes the first part of the pair $(\\omega, \\Omega)$.\n\nThe second part of the pair is the holomorphic volume form $\\Omega$, which is given by:\n$$\n\\Omega = dz^{1} \\wedge dz^{2} \\wedge dz^{3}\n$$\nwhere $dz^{k} = d(x^{2k-1} + \\mathrm{i}\\,x^{2k}) = dx^{2k-1} + \\mathrm{i}\\,dx^{2k}$.\n\nNow we compute the exterior derivatives $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$.\nFor the Kähler form $\\omega$, we apply the exterior derivative operator $\\mathrm{d}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(dx^{1} \\wedge dx^{2} + dx^{3} \\wedge dx^{4} + dx^{5} \\wedge dx^{6})\n$$\nBy linearity of $\\mathrm{d}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(dx^{1} \\wedge dx^{2}) + \\mathrm{d}(dx^{3} \\wedge dx^{4}) + \\mathrm{d}(dx^{5} \\wedge dx^{6})\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz rule for exterior derivatives, $\\mathrm{d}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{p} \\alpha \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\beta$ where $\\alpha$ is a $p$-form, and the fundamental property that $\\mathrm{d}^{2}=0$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(dx^{j} \\wedge dx^{k}) = \\mathrm{d}(dx^{j}) \\wedge dx^{k} - dx^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}(dx^{k})\n$$\nSince $x^{j}$ are coordinate functions, $dx^{j} = \\mathrm{d}(x^{j})$, so $\\mathrm{d}(dx^{j}) = \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x^{j}) = 0$.\nTherefore, each term in the sum for $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ is zero:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(dx^{2k-1} \\wedge dx^{2k}) = 0 \\wedge dx^{2k} - dx^{2k-1} \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nThis leads to the result:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0\n$$\nThe condition $\\mathrm{d}\\omega=0$ indicates that the manifold is Kähler (since the complex structure $J$ is integrable, a fact guaranteed by the existence of global holomorphic coordinates $z^k$).\n\nNext, we compute the exterior derivative of the holomorphic volume form $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\mathrm{d}(dz^{1} \\wedge dz^{2} \\wedge dz^{3})\n$$\nApplying the Leibniz rule:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\mathrm{d}(dz^{1}) \\wedge dz^{2} \\wedge dz^{3} - dz^{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}(dz^{2}) \\wedge dz^{3} + dz^{1} \\wedge dz^{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}(dz^{3})\n$$\nThe complex coordinates $z^{k}$ are functions on the manifold, so their differentials $dz^{k}$ are exact $1$-forms: $dz^{k} = \\mathrm{d}(z^{k})$. Applying the exterior derivative again yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(dz^{k}) = \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{k}) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = 0 \\wedge dz^{2} \\wedge dz^{3} - dz^{1} \\wedge 0 \\wedge dz^{3} + dz^{1} \\wedge dz^{2} \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nThus, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = 0\n$$\nThe conditions $\\mathrm{d}\\omega=0$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega=0$ confirm that the standard $SU(3)$ structure on $\\mathbb{C}^{3}$ is torsion-free.

The value of a simple $3$-form $e^i \\wedge e^j \\wedge e^k$ on $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is given by the determinant of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix:\n$$\n(e^i \\wedge e^j \\wedge e^k)(v_1, v_2, v_3) = \\det\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ne^i(v_1) & e^i(v_2) & e^i(v_3) \\\\\ne^j(v_1) & e^j(v_2) & e^j(v_3) \\\\\ne^k(v_1) & e^k(v_2) & e^k(v_3)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the values of the basis covectors $e^i$ on the vectors $v_j$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $e^{1}(v_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $e^{2}(v_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, and $e^{i}(v_1) = 0$ for $i > 2$.\n    \\item $e^{4}(v_2) = 1$, and $e^{i}(v_2) = 0$ for $i \\ne 4$.\n    \\item $e^{5}(v_3) = 1$, and $e^{i}(v_3) = 0$ for $i \\ne 5$.\n\\end{itemize}\nNow, we evaluate each term of $\\varphi_0$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $(e^{1}\\wedge e^{2}\\wedge e^{3})(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\n    \\item $(e^{1}\\wedge e^{4}\\wedge e^{5})(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} e^1(v_1) & e^1(v_2) & e^1(v_3) \\\\ e^4(v_1) & e^4(v_2) & e^4(v_3) \\\\ e^5(v_1) & e^5(v_2) & e^5(v_3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    \\item For $(e^{1}\\wedge e^{6}\\wedge e^{7})$, the rows corresponding to $e^6$ and $e^7$ are zero rows, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $(e^{2}\\wedge e^{4}\\wedge e^{6})$, the row corresponding to $e^6$ is a zero row, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $-(e^{2}\\wedge e^{5}\\wedge e^{7})$, the row corresponding to $e^7$ is a zero row, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $-(e^{3}\\wedge e^{4}\\wedge e^{7})$, the rows corresponding to $e^3$ and $e^7$ are zero rows, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $-(e^{3}\\wedge e^{5}\\wedge e^{6})$, the rows corresponding to $e^3$ and $e^6$ are zero rows, so the determinant is $0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nSumming the contributions, we find the value:\n$$\n\\varphi_{0}(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0 + 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe calibration inequality for the oriented subspace $\\Xi$, with its given oriented orthonormal basis $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, is:\n$$\n\\varphi_{0}(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) \\le 1\n$$\nwhere $1$ is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the orthonormal vectors $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, i.e., $\\text{vol}_{\\Xi}(v_1, v_2, v_3) = \\sqrt{\\det(g_0(v_i, v_j))} = \\sqrt{\\det(I_3)} = 1$.\nSubstituting our computed value, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality is true, as expected. However, since $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} < 1$, equality does not hold for the subspace $\\Xi$.\n\nThe general condition for equality, $\\varphi_0(u_1, u_2, u_3) = 1$ for an oriented orthonormal basis $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ of a $3$-dimensional subspace $\\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^7$, is that $\\Sigma$ must be an **associative $3$-plane**. Associative $3$-planes are a special class of subspaces in the geometry of $G_2$. They form a single orbit under the action of the group $G_2 \\subset SO(7)$, which is the stabilizer of $\\varphi_0$. A submanifold whose tangent planes are all associative is called an associative submanifold, and such submanifolds are volume-minimizing in their homology class due to being calibrated. The archetypal associative $3$-plane is $\\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$, on which $\\varphi_0$ evaluates to $1$. Since $\\varphi_0(\\Xi) = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\ne 1$, $\\Xi$ is not an associative $3$-plane. It is also not a coassociative $3$-plane, for which the value would be $0$.\n\nThe numerical value of $\\varphi_0(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3066220"}]}
