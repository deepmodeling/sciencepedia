The Margulis lemma is a key theorem in this field.

The definitions and data provided are sufficient to determine a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe injectivity radius at a point $p$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$, denoted $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is defined as half the length of the shortest non-trivial geodesic loop based at $p$. Our manifold is the quotient surface $S = D/\\Gamma$. Any point $p \\in S$ is an orbit $\\Gamma z$ for some $z \\in D \\subset \\mathbb{H}^2$. Due to the nature of the isometry group $\\Gamma = \\langle T \\rangle$ where $T(x,y) = (x+L, y)$, which only acts on the $x$-coordinate, the injectivity radius at a point $p$ corresponding to lifts with $y$-coordinate $y$ will only depend on $y$. We denote this by $\\operatorname{inj}(y)$.\n\nLet's choose a representative point $z_0 = x_0 + i y \\in \\mathbb{H}^2$ corresponding to a point $p \\in S$. A geodesic loop at $p$ starting and ending at $p$ lifts to a geodesic segment in the universal cover $\\mathbb{H}^2$ connecting $z_0$ to one of its images under an element of $\\Gamma$. The group $\\Gamma$ consists of elements $T^k$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $T^k(z) = z+kL$. A non-trivial loop corresponds to choosing $k \\neq 0$.\n\nThe length of such a loop is the hyperbolic distance $d_{\\mathbb{H}^2}(z_0, T^k(z_0))$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The injectivity radius is half the minimum of these lengths over all non-trivial group elements:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}} d_{\\mathbb{H}^2}(z_0, T^k(z_0)) $$\nThe hyperbolic distance $d(z_1, z_2)$ between two points $z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathbb{H}^2$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\cosh(d(z_1, z_2)) = 1 + \\frac{|z_1 - z_2|^2}{2 \\operatorname{Im}(z_1) \\operatorname{Im}(z_2)} $$\nLet $z_1 = z_0 = x_0 + iy$ and $z_2 = T^k(z_0) = (x_0 + kL) + iy$.\nWe have $\\operatorname{Im}(z_1) = y$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(z_2) = y$. The squared Euclidean distance is $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = |(x_0+iy) - (x_0+kL+iy)|^2 = |-kL|^2 = (kL)^2$.\nSubstituting these into the distance formula:\n$$ \\cosh(d(z_0, T^k(z_0))) = 1 + \\frac{(kL)^2}{2y^2} = 1 + \\frac{k^2 L^2}{2y^2} $$\nThe distance $d$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\cosh(d)$ for $d \\geq 0$. To find the shortest loop, we must minimize $d(z_0, T^k(z_0))$, which is equivalent to minimizing $\\cosh(d(z_0, T^k(z_0)))$. This in turn requires minimizing the term $\\frac{k^2 L^2}{2y^2}$. Since $L>0$ and $y>0$, we only need to minimize $k^2$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The minimum value is $1^2 = 1$, which occurs for $k=1$ and $k=-1$.\n\nThus, the length $\\ell(y)$ of the shortest non-trivial geodesic loop is given by:\n$$ \\cosh(\\ell(y)) = 1 + \\frac{L^2}{2y^2} $$\nSolving for $\\ell(y)$, we get $\\ell(y) = \\operatorname{arccosh}\\left(1 + \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}\\right)$.\nThe injectivity radius is half this length. Therefore, the exact expression for the injectivity radius at height $y$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arccosh}\\left(1 + \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}\\right) $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we prove that $\\operatorname{inj}(y) \\to 0$ as $y\\to\\infty$. We examine the limit:\n$$ \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\operatorname{inj}(y) = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arccosh}\\left(1 + \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}\\right) $$\nAs $y \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{L^2}{2y^2}$ approaches $0$. The argument of the $\\operatorname{arccosh}$ function approaches $1$. The function $f(u) = \\operatorname{arccosh}(u)$ is continuous for $u \\geq 1$, and we know that $\\operatorname{arccosh}(1)=0$. Therefore:\n$$ \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\operatorname{inj}(y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arccosh}(1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThis shows that for any given $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a height $Y$ such that for all $y > Y$, $\\operatorname{inj}(y) < \\varepsilon$. This confirms that the \"end\" of the cusp (for sufficiently large $y$) lies within the $\\varepsilon$-thin part of the surface.\n\nFinally, we compute the leading-order asymptotic rate of $\\operatorname{inj}(y)$ as $y\\to\\infty$. This requires analyzing the behavior of $\\operatorname{arccosh}(1+u)$ for small positive $u$. Let $u = \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}$, which approaches $0$ as $y\\to\\infty$.\nLet $w = \\operatorname{arccosh}(1+u)$. By definition, $\\cosh(w) = 1+u$. The Taylor series expansion of $\\cosh(w)$ around $w=0$ is:\n$$ \\cosh(w) = 1 + \\frac{w^2}{2!} + \\frac{w^4}{4!} + \\dots $$\nFor small $u$, $w$ is also small. We can write:\n$$ 1+u = 1 + \\frac{w^2}{2} + O(w^4) $$\nThis implies $u \\approx \\frac{w^2}{2}$, which gives $w \\approx \\sqrt{2u}$ for the leading-order term.\nThus, for small $u$, we have the asymptotic behavior $\\operatorname{arccosh}(1+u) \\sim \\sqrt{2u}$.\nSubstituting $u = \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}$:\n$$ \\operatorname{arccosh}\\left(1 + \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}\\right) \\sim \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L^2}{y^2}} = \\frac{L}{y} \\quad (\\text{since } L>0, y>0) $$\nNow, we find the asymptotic expression for $\\operatorname{inj}(y)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arccosh}\\left(1 + \\frac{L^2}{2y^2}\\right) \\sim \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{L}{y}\\right) = \\frac{L}{2y} $$\nThe leading-order asymptotic rate of $\\operatorname{inj}(y)$ as $y\\to\\infty$ is given by the expression $\\frac{L}{2y}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{L}{2y}}$$", "id": "3074172"}, {"introduction": "Having established that cusps are thin due to their diminishing injectivity radius, we now explore their other geometric properties.
