Verification of the Curvature Bound**\n\nThe metric on $T^2$ is defined as the flat metric induced from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. By definition, a flat Riemannian manifold has zero sectional curvature at every point. For a $2$-dimensional manifold (a surface), the Gaussian curvature $K$ is the only sectional curvature.

Verification of the Volume Bound**\n\nThe volume (in this case, area) of the torus $T^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2/\\Lambda$ is the area of any fundamental domain for the lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For the lattice $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$, a standard choice for a fundamental domain is the unit square $F = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nThe metric is induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, for which the area element is $dA = dx \\, dy$. The volume of the torus is thus:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(T^2) = \\int_F dA = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 dx \\, dy = 1 $$\nWe need to verify the bound $\\operatorname{vol}(T^2) \\geq v_0$.\nGiven $v_0=1$, we have:\n$$ 1 \\geq 1 $$\nThis inequality is true, so the volume bound is satisfied.\n\n**3.

This implies we can fix one point, say $p_0$, and the diameter will be the maximum distance from $p_0$ to any other point $q \\in T^2$. Let us choose $p_0$ to be the point corresponding to the origin in the fundamental domain, so its lift is $\\tilde{p}_0 = (0,0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(T^2) = \\sup_{q \\in T^2} d(p_0, q) $$\nNow, let $q$ be any other point on the torus. We can represent $q$ by a lift $\\tilde{q} = (x,y)$ that lies in the fundamental domain $F = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$. By the definition provided, the distance $d(p_0, q)$ is the infimum of the Euclidean distances in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ between the lift $\\tilde{p}_0$ and all possible lifts of $q$. The lifts of $q$ are of the form $\\tilde{q} + \\lambda$ for $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n$$ d(p_0, q) = \\inf_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\| \\tilde{p}_0 - (\\tilde{q}+\\lambda) \\| = \\inf_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\| -\\tilde{q}-\\lambda \\| = \\inf_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\| \\tilde{q}+\\lambda \\| $$\nLet $\\lambda = (m,n)$ where $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.

The term $\\inf_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (x+m)^2 = (\\min(x, 1-x))^2$. Similarly, for $y \\in [0,1]$, $\\inf_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (y+n)^2 = (\\min(y, 1-y))^2$.\nSo, the squared distance from the origin to a point represented by $(x,y) \\in [0,1]\\times[0,1]$ is:\n$$ d(p_0, q)^2 = (\\min(x, 1-x))^2 + (\\min(y, 1-y))^2 $$\nTo find the diameter, we must maximize this quantity over all $(x,y) \\in [0,1] \\times [0,1]$. The function $f(t) = (\\min(t, 1-t))^2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ is maximized when $t=1-t$, which means $t=1/2$. The maximum value is $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nThe expression for $d(p_0,q)^2$ is a sum of two such functions, one for $x$ and one for $y$. Thus, the maximum is achieved when $x=1/2$ and $y=1/2$.\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(T^2)^2 = \\sup_{(x,y) \\in [0,1]^2} d(p_0, q)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTaking the square root, we find the exact value of the diameter:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(T^2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\nThe point on the torus maximally distant from the origin is represented by $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$, the center of the fundamental square.\n\nNow we verify the diameter bound $\\operatorname{diam}(T^2) \\leq D_0$.

The Riemannian metric is given in global coordinates $(x,y)$ on the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as $g_{\\varepsilon} = a^{2} \\, dx^{2} + \\varepsilon^{2} \\, dy^{2}$. The metric tensor components are $g_{11} = a^2$, $g_{22} = \\varepsilon^2$, and $g_{12} = g_{21} = 0$. These components are constant throughout the manifold.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, are defined by the formula:\n$$ \\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{li}}{\\partial x^j} + \\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right) $$\nSince all components $g_{ij}$ are constant, their partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates are zero. For example, $\\frac{\\partial g_{11}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial a^2}{\\partial x} = 0$. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero: $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\nThe components of the Riemann curvature tensor, $R^l_{ijk}$, are given by:\n$$ R^l_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ik}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} + \\sum_{p=1}^2 \\left( \\Gamma^p_{ik} \\Gamma^l_{pj} - \\Gamma^p_{ij} \\Gamma^l_{pk} \\right) $$\nSince all $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero, their derivatives are also zero, and all products of Christoffel symbols are zero. Therefore, all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero: $R^l_{ijk}=0$.\n\nThe sectional curvature $K(P)$ of a $2$-plane $P$ spanned by two orthonormal vectors $u, v$ is given by $K(P) = g(R(u,v)v, u)$. Since the Riemann tensor is zero, the sectional curvature is identically zero for any plane in any tangent space. Thus, the sectional curvature of the torus is $K_{\\varepsilon} = 0$. This means that $(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ is a flat manifold for any $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the diameter $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}, g_{\\varepsilon})$. The diameter is defined as the supremum of the geodesic distance between any two points on the manifold: $\\operatorname{diam}(M) = \\sup_{p,q \\in M} d(p,q)$.\nThe torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}$ is the quotient of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.

The metric on the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $g_{\\varepsilon} = a^{2} \\, dx^{2} + \\varepsilon^{2} \\, dy^{2}$. The distance between two points $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with this metric is the length of a straight line:\n$$ d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(P_1, P_2) = \\sqrt{a^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + \\varepsilon^2(y_2-y_1)^2} $$\nThe distance between two points $p_1, p_2$ on the torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}$ is the minimum of the distances between their lifts in the covering space.

Let $p_1$ be the point corresponding to $(0,0)$ and $p_2$ be the point corresponding to $(x,y) \\in [0,1) \\times [0,1)$.

This point is the center of the fundamental cell, $(x,y) = (1/2, 1/2)$. The distance from the origin to any of its four nearest lattice images $( \\pm 1/2, \\pm 1/2)$ is the same. The distance on the torus from $(0,0)$ to $(1/2, 1/2)$ is simply the straight-line distance in the covering space:\n$$ d_{\\mathbb{T}^2}((0,0), (1/2, 1/2)) = \\sqrt{a^2(1/2 - 0)^2 + \\varepsilon^2(1/2 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{a^2 + \\varepsilon^2} $$\nThis is the maximal distance between any two points on the torus. Thus, the diameter is:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}, g_{\\varepsilon}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{a^2 + \\varepsilon^2} $$\n\nFinally, we analyze the sequence of manifolds $(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ in the context of Cheeger's finiteness theorem. A version of this theorem states that the class of $n$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ satisfying bounds on sectional curvature $|K_M| \\leq C_1$, diameter $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\leq C_2$, and a uniform lower bound on volume $\\operatorname{vol}(M) \\geq v > 0$, contains only a finite number of diffeomorphism types.\n\nLet's check these conditions for our sequence of tori as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$:\n$1.$ Bounded Curvature: We found $K_{\\varepsilon} = 0$ for all $\\varepsilon > 0$.

As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, we have $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}) = \\frac{a}{2}$. For any family where $\\varepsilon$ is bounded, say $\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1]$, the diameter is also bounded.\n$3.$ Volume: The volume element is $dV_{g_\\varepsilon} = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx \\wedge dy = \\sqrt{a^2 \\varepsilon^2} \\, dx \\wedge dy = a\\varepsilon \\, dx \\wedge dy$. The volume of the torus is:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 a\\varepsilon \\, dx \\, dy = a\\varepsilon $$\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, we see that $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\operatorname{vol}(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}) = 0$.\n\nThe sequence of manifolds $(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ satisfies the conditions of bounded curvature and bounded diameter, but it violates the non-collapsing condition, as its volume is not bounded below by any strictly positive constant. This phenomenon is known as collapse. In the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, the sequence of $2$-dimensional manifolds $(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ converges to a $1$-dimensional metric space, namely a circle $S^1$ of circumference $a$.\n\nThis example demonstrates that the first two conditions of Cheeger's theorem (bounded curvature and diameter) are not sufficient to prevent a sequence of manifolds from collapsing to a lower-dimensional space. The non-collapsing hypothesis ($\\operatorname{vol}(M) \\ge v > 0$) is essential to ensure that the limiting spaces (if any) are manifolds of the same dimension and ultimately to constrain the topology of the manifolds in the class to a finite number of types. Without this hypothesis, one could construct infinite families of Riemannian manifolds (even with a single underlying topological type, as here) that have bounded curvature and diameter but exhibit geometric degeneracy, as illustrated by the volume shrinking to zero.\n\nThe ordered pair $(K_{\\varepsilon}, \\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{T}^{2}_{\\varepsilon}, g_{\\varepsilon}))$ is $(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{a^2 + \\varepsilon^2})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{a^2 + \\varepsilon^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3039092"}, {"introduction": "How do purely geometric constraints manage to limit the number of possible manifold shapes?

The upper bound is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\alpha_{n}}{v} \\int_{0}^{D} \\left(\\frac{\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\Lambda}\\,t)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}\\right)^{n-1} dt\n$$\nThis bound depends only on $n, \\Lambda, D$, and $v$, as required.\n\nThis packing bound is a crucial element in the proof of Cheeger's finiteness theorem. A maximal packing of $N$ disjoint balls $\\{B(p_i, r_*)\\}_{i=1}^N$ implies that the collection of doubled balls $\\{B(p_i, 2r_*)\\}_{i=1}^N$ forms a cover of the entire manifold $M$. The nerve of this finite cover is a simplicial complex with $N$ vertices. One can show that this nerve is homotopy equivalent to $M$. Since $N$ is bounded by a quantity depending only on $n, \\Lambda, D, v$, the number of possible combinatorial structures (the nerves) for such manifolds is finite. This control over the combinatorial complexity is the first major step towards proving that there are only finitely many diffeomorphism types of manifolds satisfying the given geometric bounds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2 \\alpha_{n}}{v} \\int_{0}^{D} \\left(\\frac{\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\Lambda} t)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}\\right)^{n-1} dt}$$", "id": "3039123"}]}
