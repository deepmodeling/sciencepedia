That is, for any point $p \\in T^{n}$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ that is isometric to an open set in Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{std}})$, where $g_{\\mathrm{std}}$ is the standard Euclidean metric. The Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is a local invariant of the metric. Therefore, the curvature tensor of $(T^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ at any point is identical to the curvature tensor of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{std}})$.\n\nLet us compute the curvature of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{std}})$. In the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n})$, the components of the standard metric tensor are given by $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, the Kronecker delta. These components are constant functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols of the second kind) are given by the formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^{l}} \\right)\n$$\nSince the metric components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant, all their partial derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^{i}} = 0$ for all $i,j,l$. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = 0\n$$\nThe components of the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ are defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols:\n$$\nR^{l}{}_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{l}_{ik}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{l}_{jk}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\sum_{p=1}^{n} \\left( \\Gamma^{p}_{ik} \\Gamma^{l}_{pj} - \\Gamma^{p}_{jk} \\Gamma^{l}_{pi} \\right)\n$$\nSince all $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ are zero, all their derivatives are also zero. The products of Christoffel symbols are also zero. Thus, all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero:\n$$\nR^{l}{}_{ijk} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is the zero tensor. For any vector fields $u,v,w$, we have $R(u,v)w = 0$.\n\nThe sectional curvature $K(p, \\sigma)$ for a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_{p}T^{n}$ spanned by linearly independent vectors $u,v$ is given by:\n$$\nK(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{\\langle R(u,v)v,u \\rangle}{\\langle u,u \\rangle \\langle v,v \\rangle - \\langle u,v \\rangle^{2}}\n$$\nSince $R$ is the zero tensor, $R(u,v)v = 0$. The numerator is therefore $\\langle 0, u \\rangle = 0$. The denominator is non-zero because $u$ and $v$ are linearly independent. Thus, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{0}{\\langle u,u \\rangle \\langle v,v \\rangle - \\langle u,v \\rangle^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any point $p \\in T^{n}$ and any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_{p}T^{n}$. The torus $(T^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ is a flat manifold.\n\nPart (b): Justification for $(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon})$ being a collapsing sequence with bounded curvature.\n\nWe consider the sequence of Riemannian manifolds $(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon})$ where $g_{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon^{2} g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$ and $\\epsilon \\to 0$. We must show two properties: bounded curvature and collapse.\n\n1. Bounded Curvature:\nLet $g = g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$ and $\\tilde{g} = g_{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon^{2}g$. Let $\\nabla$ and $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ be their respective Levi-Civita connections. The connection is determined by the Koszul formula. For a constant scaling of the metric $\\tilde{g} = c g$ (with $c=\\epsilon^2$ being a constant), the connection is invariant. Let's verify this.\n$2\\tilde{g}(\\tilde{\\nabla}_{X}Y, Z) = X(\\tilde{g}(Y,Z)) + \\dots = X(c g(Y,Z)) + \\dots = c(X(g(Y,Z)) + \\dots) = c(2g(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z))$.\nSubstituting $\\tilde{g} = c g$ on the left side gives $2cg(\\tilde{\\nabla}_{X}Y, Z) = 2cg(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z)$, which implies $\\tilde{\\nabla}_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X}Y$. The Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant homothetic scaling.\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is defined as $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z - \\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$. Since $\\tilde{\\nabla} = \\nabla$, the curvature tensor as a $(1,3)$-tensor field is also invariant: $\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Z = R(X,Y)Z$.\n\nNow we compute the sectional curvature $\\tilde{K}$ for the metric $\\tilde{g}=g_{\\epsilon}$. Let $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denote the inner product for $g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$ and $\\tilde{\\langle} \\cdot, \\cdot \\tilde{\\rangle}$ denote the inner product for $g_{\\epsilon}$. So, $\\tilde{\\langle} u,v \\tilde{\\rangle} = \\epsilon^{2} \\langle u,v \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(p\n,\\sigma) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\langle} \\tilde{R}(u,v)v,u \\tilde{\\rangle}}{\\tilde{\\langle} u,u \\tilde{\\rangle} \\tilde{\\langle} v,v \\tilde{\\rangle} - \\tilde{\\langle} u,v \\tilde{\\rangle}^{2}}\n$$\nUsing $\\tilde{R}=R$ and $\\tilde{\\langle} \\cdot, \\cdot \\tilde{\\rangle} = \\epsilon^{2} \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$, we get:\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{\\epsilon^{2} \\langle R(u,v)v,u \\rangle}{(\\epsilon^{2}\\langle u,u \\rangle)(\\epsilon^{2}\\langle v,v \\rangle) - (\\epsilon^{2}\\langle u,v \\rangle)^{2}} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{\\epsilon^{4}} \\frac{\\langle R(u,v)v,u \\rangle}{\\langle u,u \\rangle\\langle v,v \\rangle - \\langle u,v \\rangle^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2}} K(p,\\sigma)\n$$\nFrom part (a), the sectional curvature of $(T^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ is $K(p,\\sigma) = 0$. Therefore, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, the sectional curvature of $(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon})$ is:\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2}} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe sectional curvature is identically zero for all $\\epsilon$. Thus, the curvature is bounded, for example by any constant $C \\ge 0$. This satisfies the \"bounded curvature\" condition.\n\n2. Collapsing:\nA sequence of Riemannian manifolds is said to collapse if their volumes tend to zero while their curvatures remain uniformly bounded. We have already established bounded curvature. Now we analyze the volume.\nThe volume form $dV_{g}$ associated with a metric $g$ in local coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ is $dV_{g} = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}$.\nFor the metric $g_{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon^{2} g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$, the matrix of components is $(g_{\\epsilon})_{ij} = \\epsilon^{2} (g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det((g_{\\epsilon})_{ij}) = \\det(\\epsilon^{2} (g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij}) = (\\epsilon^{2})^{n} \\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij}) = \\epsilon^{2n} \\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij})$.\nTherefore, the volume form scales as:\n$$\ndV_{g_{\\epsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\epsilon^{2n} \\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij})} \\, d^n x = \\epsilon^{n} \\sqrt{\\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij})} \\, d^n x = \\epsilon^{n} dV_{g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}}\n$$\nThe volume of the manifold is the integral of its volume form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon}) = \\int_{T^{n}} dV_{g_{\\epsilon}} = \\int_{T^{n}} \\epsilon^{n} dV_{g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}} = \\epsilon^{n} \\mathrm{Vol}(T^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})\n$$\nThe volume of the standard flat torus $(T^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ is the volume of the fundamental domain $[0,1]^{n}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is $1$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon}) = \\epsilon^{n} \\cdot 1 = \\epsilon^{n}\n$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the volume $\\mathrm{Vol}(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon}) = \\epsilon^{n} \\to 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nSince the sequence of manifolds $(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon})$ has uniformly bounded sectional curvature (identically zero) and their volumes tend to zero, it is, by definition, a collapsing sequence with bounded curvature. The sequence collapses to a point in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, as can be seen by observing that the diameter, $\\mathrm{diam}(T^{n}, g_{\\epsilon}) = \\epsilon \\cdot \\mathrm{diam}(T^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}) = \\epsilon \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$, also tends to zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3041444"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that a manifold can collapse, we now ask: how can we quantify this convergence?

The Riemannian metric on $X$ is given by $g_{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon^{2} d\\theta^{2} + d\\phi^{2}$. The space $Y$ is the unit circle $S^{1}$ with its standard metric. The problem provides the following definitions which we shall use exclusively.\n\nThe geodesic distance on $X$ between points $x_1 = (\\theta_1, \\phi_1)$ and $x_2 = (\\theta_2, \\phi_2)$ is\n$$d_{X}(x_1, x_2) = \\min_{k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sqrt{\\epsilon^{2}(\\theta_2-\\theta_1+2\\pi k)^{2} + (\\phi_2-\\phi_1+2\\pi m)^{2}}.$$\nThe metric on $X$ is a product metric. Therefore, the squared distance on the torus is the sum of the squared distances on the component circles. The distance on a circle of radius $r$ between angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is $d_{S^{1}_{r}}(\\alpha, \\beta) = r \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\alpha-\\beta+2\\pi k|$.

Let $A = d_{S^{1}_{\\epsilon}}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ and $B = d_{S^{1}_{1}}(\\phi_1, \\phi_2)$. The values of $A$ can range over the interval $[0, \\pi\\epsilon]$ (as the maximum distance on a circle of radius $\\epsilon$ is half its circumference). Similarly, the values of $B$ can range over $[0, \\pi]$.\nThe expression for the distortion becomes the supremum of\n$$|\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} - B|.$$\nSince $A = d_{S^{1}_{\\epsilon}}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) \\ge 0$, we have $\\sqrt{A^2+B^2} \\ge \\sqrt{B^2} = B$.

The partial derivative with respect to $A$ is\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial A} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}.$$\nFor $A > 0$, this derivative is positive, so $f(A,B)$ is a strictly increasing function of $A$.

Thus, the numerator is negative, and $g'(B)  0$ for all $B \\ge 0$. This means $g(B)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $B$.\nThe maximum value of $g(B)$ on the interval $[0, \\pi]$ is therefore attained at the left endpoint, $B=0$.\nThe maximum value is $g(0) = \\sqrt{(\\pi\\epsilon)^2 + 0^2} - 0 = \\pi\\epsilon$.\nThis confirms that the supremum of $f(A,B)$ over the domain is $\\pi\\epsilon$.\nTherefore, the distortion of our chosen correspondence is\n$$\\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}) = \\pi\\epsilon.$$\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance is defined as $d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\inf_{\\mathcal{R}} \\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R})$, where the infimum is taken over all possible correspondences.

We identify $S^3$ with the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{C}^2$. A point $p \\in S^3$ is represented by $(z_1, z_2) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$ with $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$. The $S^1$ fiber action is given by $e^{i\\theta} \\cdot p = (e^{i\\theta}z_1, e^{i\\theta}z_2)$. The vertical distribution $\\mathcal{V}$ is tangent to these fibers. The generator of this action is the vector field $V_p = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}|_{\\theta=0} (e^{i\\theta}p) = ip$. Since $|p|=1$, the vector field $V$ is of unit length with respect to the standard metric $g$ on $S^3$, i.e., $g(V,V)=1$.\n\nThe horizontal distribution $\\mathcal{H}$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathcal{V}$ in $T S^3$. The tangent space $T_p S^3$ consists of vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ (identified with $T_p \\mathbb{C}^2$) that are orthogonal to the position vector $p$. Thus, for $X \\in T_p S^3$, we have $g(X,p)=0$. For $X$ to be in $\\mathcal{H}_p$, it must also be orthogonal to $V_p=ip$, which means $g(X, ip)=0$. These two conditions are equivalent to the single condition $\\langle X, p \\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}} = 0$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}}$ is the standard Hermitian inner product on $\\mathbb{C}^2$. The almost complex structure $J$ on $\\mathbb{C}^2$ is multiplication by $i$. For a horizontal vector $X \\in \\mathcal{H}_p$, $JX=iX$ is also horizontal since $\\langle iX, p \\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}} = -i \\langle X, p \\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}} = 0$.

A property of Killing fields is that the operator $\\nabla V$ is skew-symmetric, i.e., $g(\\nabla_X V, Y) = -g(X, \\nabla_Y V)$. Also, for the standard Hopf fibration, it is a known result that the covariant derivative of the vertical field $V$ in a horizontal direction $X$ is given by $\\nabla_X V = -JX$.\nSubstituting this into our expression:\n$$g(\\nabla_X Y, V) = -g(Y, -JX) = g(Y,JX)$$\nThe metric $g$ is compatible with the complex structure $J$, which means $g(Y,JX) = -g(JY,X)$.\nTherefore, $g(\\nabla_X Y, V) = -g(JY,X)$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the $A$-tensor:\n$$A_X Y = -g(JY,X)V$$\nNote that since $g(JY,X)=-g(Y,JX)$, we can also write $A_X Y = g(Y,JX)V$. The expression is skew-symmetric in $X$ and $Y$, as required for the $A$-tensor of a submersion with totally geodesic fibers. $A_Y X = -g(JX,Y)V = g(X,JY)V = -g(JY,X)V = -A_X Y$.\n\nTo find the pointwise norm of $A_X Y$ for an orthonormal horizontal pair $(X,Y)$, we compute $\\|A_X Y\\|_g^2$.\n$$\\|A_X Y\\|_g^2 = \\|-g(JY,X)V\\|_g^2 = (g(JY,X))^2 \\|V\\|_g^2$$\nSince $V$ is a unit vector field, $\\|V\\|_g^2 = 1$. The horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}_p$ at any point $p$ is a $2$-dimensional real vector space equipped with the complex structure $J$. If $X$ and $Y$ form an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_p$, then $Y$ must be equal to $\\pm JX$.\nLet's assume $Y=JX$. Then $g(JY,X) = g(J(JX),X) = g(-X,X) = -g(X,X) = -\\|X\\|^2 = -1$.\nIf $Y=-JX$, then $g(JY,X) = g(J(-JX),X) = g(X,X) = \\|X\\|^2 = 1$.\nIn either case, $(g(JY,X))^2 = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\|A_X Y\\|_g^2 = 1^2 \\cdot 1 = 1$, and the norm is $\\|A_X Y\\|_g = 1$.\n\n### Part (b): Sectional curvatures for Berger metrics $g_s$\n\nThe family of Berger metrics $g_s$ is defined by $g_s|_\\mathcal{H} = g|_\\mathcal{H}$ and $g_s|_\\mathcal{V} = s^2 g|_\\mathcal{V}$. An orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p S^3$ with respect to $g_s$ can be formed by taking $\\{X, JX\\}$, an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_p$ (which is orthonormal for both $g$ and $g_s$), and $U=V/s$, which is the $g_s$-unit vertical vector.\n\nO'Neill's formula for the sectional curvature of a horizontal plane spanned by $g_s$-orthonormal vectors $X, Y$ in a Riemannian submersion is:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s) = \\hat{K}(\\pi_*X, \\pi_*Y) - 3 \\|A^s_X Y\\|_{g_s}^2$$\nHere, $\\hat{K}=4$ is the curvature of the base space $S^2$. The $A$-tensor for the metric $g_s$, denoted $A^s$, is related to the $A$-tensor for the standard metric $g=g_1$, denoted $A^1$. A detailed calculation involving the Koszul formula for both metrics shows that the vertical component of $\\nabla_X Y$ is unchanged when rescaling the metric on the fibers, i.e., $A^s_X Y = A^1_X Y = -g(JY,X)V$.\nWe now compute the norm of this tensor with respect to the $g_s$ metric:\n$$\\|A^s_X Y\\|_{g_s}^2 = \\|-g(JY,X)V\\|_{g_s}^2 = (g(JY,X))^2 \\|V\\|_{g_s}^2$$\nFor an orthonormal horizontal pair $(X,Y)$, we have $(g(JY,X))^2 = 1$. The norm of $V$ under $g_s$ is $\\|V\\|_{g_s}^2 = g_s(V,V) = s^2 g(V,V) = s^2$.\nSo, $\\|A^s_X Y\\|_{g_s}^2 = 1 \\cdot s^2 = s^2$.\nSubstituting this into the curvature formula:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s) = 4 - 3 s^2$$\n\nFor the mixed sectional curvature, $K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)$, of a plane spanned by a $g_s$-unit horizontal vector $X$ and the $g_s$-unit vertical vector $U=V/s$, we use another of O'Neill's formulas. For a submersion with totally geodesic fibers (which the Hopf fibration is, for any $s$), the formula relates the mixed curvature to the $A$-tensor:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s) = \\|A_X^* U\\|_{g_s}^2$$\nwhere $A_X^* U = \\mathcal{H}(\\nabla_U X)$. This is a standard result for Berger spheres, which can be derived using Lie group theory or submersion theory, although the derivation is somewhat lengthy. The accepted result is:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s) = s^2$$\n\nFor completeness, let's verify these results for the standard sphere ($s=1$).\n$K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(1) = 4 - 3(1)^2 = 1$.\n$K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(1) = 1^2 = 1$.\nSince all sectional curvatures are $1$, the space $(S^3, g_1)$ has constant sectional curvature $1$, which is correct.\n\n### Part (c): Scalar curvature $R(s)$\n\nThe scalar curvature $R(s)$ at a point is the sum of the Ricci curvatures of an orthonormal basis, which in turn is a sum of sectional curvatures. Let $\\{E_1, E_2, E_3\\}$ be a $g_s$-orthonormal basis for $T_p S^3$, where $E_1, E_2$ are horizontal and $E_3$ is vertical.\nThe Ricci curvatures are:\n$Ric_s(E_1, E_1) = K_s(E_1, E_2) + K_s(E_1, E_3) = K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s) + K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)$.\n$Ric_s(E_2, E_2) = K_s(E_2, E_1) + K_s(E_2, E_3) = K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s) + K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)$.\n$Ric_s(E_3, E_3) = K_s(E_3, E_1) + K_s(E_3, E_2) = K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s) + K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s) = 2 K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)$.\n\nThe scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor: $R(s) = Ric_s(E_1, E_1) + Ric_s(E_2, E_2) + Ric_s(E_3, E_3)$.\n$$R(s) = (K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s) + K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)) + (K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s) + K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)) + (2 K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s))$$\n$$R(s) = 2 K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s) + 4 K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_{\\mathrm{hor}}(s)$ and $K_{\\mathrm{mix}}(s)$ from part (b):\n$$R(s) = 2(4 - 3s^2) + 4(s^2)$$\n$$R(s) = 8 - 6s^2 + 4s^2$$\n$$R(s) = 8 - 2s^2$$\n\nAs a check, for $s=1$, we have the standard round $S^3$ with constant sectional curvature $K=1$. Its scalar curvature is $n(n-1)K = 3(2)(1) = 6$. Our formula gives $R(1) = 8 - 2(1)^2 = 6$, which is correct.\nAs $s \\to 0$, $S^3$ collapses to $S^2$. $R(s) \\to 8$. The scalar curvature of the base $S^2$ with Gaussian curvature $4$ is $R_{S^2} = 2 \\times 4 = 8$. This limit is also consistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8 - 2s^2}$$", "id": "3041418"}]}
