The Gromov–Hausdorff distance $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ between compact metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ is defined as the infimum, over all isometric embeddings of $X$ and $Y$ into a common metric space $Z$, of the Hausdorff distance $d_{H}^{Z}(\\varphi(X),\\psi(Y))$ between the images.

Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that $a \\le b$. Our goal is to find an expression for the distance under this assumption, which can then be generalized.\n\nWe will establish the value of $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ by finding matching upper and lower bounds.\n\nFirst, to establish an upper bound, we construct specific isometric embeddings of $X$ and $Y$ into a common metric space and compute the Hausdorff distance between their images. Let the common metric space be $(\\mathbb{R}, d_{\\mathbb{R}})$.\nLet's define the isometric embedding $\\psi: Y \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as the identity map, $\\psi(y) = y$. The image is $\\psi(Y) = [0,b]$.\nTo minimize the Hausdorff distance to $\\psi(Y)$, we should embed $X$ such that its image is centered within $\\psi(Y)$. We define the embedding $\\varphi: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $\\varphi(x) = x + c$, where $c$ is a constant chosen to place the interval $[c, a+c]$ centrally within $[0,b]$. The optimal placement gives $c = \\frac{b-a}{2}$. This map is an isometry because it is a simple translation.\nThe image of $X$ is $\\varphi(X) = \\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, a + \\frac{b-a}{2}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]$.\nSince $a \\le b$, we have $0 \\le \\frac{b-a}{2}$. Also, $\\frac{b+a}{2} \\le \\frac{b+b}{2}=b$. Thus, $\\varphi(X) \\subseteq \\psi(Y)$.\n\nNow, we compute the Hausdorff distance $d_{H}^{\\mathbb{R}}(\\varphi(X), \\psi(Y))$. By definition,\n$$d_{H}^{\\mathbb{R}}(\\varphi(X),\\psi(Y)) = \\max\\left\\{\\sup_{u \\in \\varphi(X)}\\inf_{v \\in \\psi(Y)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v),\\; \\sup_{v \\in \\psi(Y)}\\inf_{u \\in \\varphi(X)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v)\\right\\}.$$\nSince $\\varphi(X) \\subseteq \\psi(Y)$, for any $u \\in \\varphi(X)$, we have $u \\in \\psi(Y)$, so $\\inf_{v \\in \\psi(Y)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v) = 0$. The first term in the 'max' is therefore $0$.\nThe distance becomes\n$$d_{H}^{\\mathbb{R}}(\\varphi(X),\\psi(Y)) = \\sup_{v \\in \\psi(Y)} \\inf_{u \\in \\varphi(X)} d_{\\mathbb{R}}(u,v) = \\sup_{v \\in [0,b]} d_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(v, \\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]\\right).$$\nThe distance from a point $v$ to a closed interval is maximized at the points furthest from the interval. The set $\\psi(Y) = [0,b]$ has two endpoints, $0$ and $b$.\nThe distance from $v=0$ to the interval $\\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]$ is $d_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(0, \\frac{b-a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nThe distance from $v=b$ to the interval is $d_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(b, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right) = b - \\frac{b+a}{2} = \\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nFor any point $v \\in [0,b]$, its distance to the interval $\\left[\\frac{b-a}{2}, \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right]$ will not exceed $\\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nThus, the supremum is $\\frac{b-a}{2}$.\nSo for this particular choice of embeddings, the Hausdorff distance is $\\frac{b-a}{2}$. Since the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is the infimum over all possible embeddings, we have the upper bound:\n$$d_{GH}(X,Y) \\le \\frac{b-a}{2}.$$\n\nNext, we establish a lower bound. Let $d = d_{GH}(X,Y)$. By the definition of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exist a metric space $(Z, d_Z)$ and isometric embeddings $\\varphi: X \\to Z$ and $\\psi: Y \\to Z$ such that $d_H^Z(\\varphi(X), \\psi(Y))  d + \\epsilon$.\nThis implies that for any point $p \\in \\psi(Y)$, there exists a point $q \\in \\varphi(X)$ such that $d_Z(p,q)  d+\\epsilon$.\nLet's consider the points $y_1 = 0$ and $y_2 = b$ in $Y$. These points realize the diameter of $Y$, $\\text{diam}(Y) = d_Y(y_1, y_2) = b$.\nBecause $d_H^Z(\\varphi(X), \\psi(Y))  d+\\epsilon$, there must exist points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ such that $d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\varphi(x_1))  d+\\epsilon$ and $d_Z(\\psi(y_2), \\varphi(x_2))  d+\\epsilon$.\nThe map $\\psi$ is an isometry, so $d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\psi(y_2)) = d_Y(y_1, y_2) = b$.\nUsing the triangle inequality in $Z$:\n$$d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\psi(y_2)) \\le d_Z(\\psi(y_1), \\varphi(x_1)) + d_Z(\\varphi(x_1), \\varphi(x_2)) + d_Z(\\varphi(x_2), \\psi(y_2)).$$\nSubstituting the known values and bounds:\n$$b  (d+\\epsilon) + d_Z(\\varphi(x_1), \\varphi(x_2)) + (d+\\epsilon).$$\nSince $\\varphi$ is an isometry, $d_Z(\\varphi(x_1), \\varphi(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2) = |x_1-x_2|$. The distance $|x_1-x_2|$ is bounded by the diameter of $X$, which is $a$.\nSo, we have:\n$$b  2(d+\\epsilon) + d_X(x_1, x_2) \\le 2(d+\\epsilon) + \\text{diam}(X) = 2(d+\\epsilon) + a.$$\nThis gives the inequality $b-a  2(d+\\epsilon)$. As this must hold for any $\\epsilon  0$, we can take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n$$b-a \\le 2d.$$\nThis implies $d \\ge \\frac{b-a}{2}$. This provides the lower bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance:\n$$d_{GH}(X,Y) \\ge \\frac{b-a}{2}.$$\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we have $\\frac{b-a}{2} \\le d_{GH}(X,Y) \\le \\frac{b-a}{2}$, which forces the equality:\n$$d_{GH}\\!\\left([0,a],[0,b]\\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2}.$$\nThis result was derived under the assumption $a \\le b$. If we had assumed $b \\le a$, the same argument would yield $d_{GH}\\!\\left([0,a],[0,b]\\right) = \\frac{a-b}{2}$. To cover all cases for $a0$ and $b0$, we use the absolute value:\n$$d_{GH}\\!\\left([0,a],[0,b]\\right) = \\frac{|a-b|}{2}.$$\nThis is the final expression for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the two specified compact metric spaces.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{|a-b|}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3048479"}, {"introduction": "The proof of Gromov's compactness theorem relies on approximating continuous spaces with finite \"nets\" and then relating these approximations.

It requires an understanding of Gromov's compactness theorem and the phenomenon of collapsing, which are central topics in the field. No flaws are identified in the problem setup.\n\nThe core principle for this problem is Gromov's compactness theorem. A key version of this theorem states that for a fixed dimension $n$, the class of compact Riemannian $n$-manifolds $(M, g)$ satisfying a uniform lower bound on Ricci curvature, $\\operatorname{Ric}(g) \\ge (n-1)\\kappa$ for some constant $\\kappa$, and a uniform upper bound on diameter, $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\le D$, is precompact in the Gromov-Hausdorff ($d_{GH}$) metric.\n\nA uniform two-sided bound on sectional curvature, $|\\sec_M| \\le K$ for some $K \\ge 0$, implies a uniform lower bound on sectional curvature, $\\sec_M \\ge -K$. For an $n$-dimensional manifold, the Ricci curvature in a direction $v$ is the average of sectional curvatures of $2$-planes containing $v$. Specifically, if $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ is an orthonormal basis with $e_1=v$, then $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) = \\sum_{i=2}^n \\sec(v, e_i)$.

Collapsing occurs when a sequence in such a precompact class converges to a limit space of a strictly lower dimension. This typically happens when the volume of the manifolds in the sequence tends to $0$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n### Option A\n\n(i) The example sequence is $\\{M_k\\}$, where $M_k = S^1(1/k) \\times S^2(1)$. The dimension is $n=3$.\n- **Sectional Curvature**: For a product manifold $N_1 \\times N_2$, the sectional curvature of a plane spanned by vectors tangent to both factors is $0$. The sectional curvature of a plane tangent to the $S^2(1)$ factor is the curvature of $S^2(1)$, which is $1/1^2 = 1$. The sectional curvature of a plane tangent to the $S^1(1/k)$ factor is the curvature of $S^1(1/k)$, which is $0$. Therefore, the sectional curvatures of $M_k$ are either $0$ or $1$. Thus, we have a uniform bound $|\\sec_{M_k}| \\le 1$ for all $k$.\n- **Diameter**: The diameter of a product of metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ with the product metric is $\\operatorname{diam}(X \\times Y) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{diam}(X)^2 + \\operatorname{diam}(Y)^2}$. Here, $\\operatorname{diam}(S^1(r)) = \\pi r$ and $\\operatorname{diam}(S^2(r)) = \\pi r$. So, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) = \\sqrt{(\\pi/k)^2 + (\\pi \\cdot 1)^2} = \\pi \\sqrt{1/k^2 + 1}$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) \\to \\pi$. The sequence of diameters is bounded, for instance by $\\operatorname{diam}(M_1) = \\pi\\sqrt{2}$.\n- **Collapsing**: As $k \\to \\infty$, the factor $S^1(1/k)$ shrinks in size and converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a single point. Consequently, the sequence $\\{M_k\\}$ converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric to $S^2(1)$. The topological dimension of the limit space is $\\dim(S^2(1)) = 2$, which is less than the dimension of the manifolds $n=3$. This is a canonical example of collapsing.\nPart (i) is correct.\n\n(ii) The reason given is that the class is $d_{GH}$-precompact because Gromov's theorem guarantees precompactness for classes with a uniform lower Ricci bound and a uniform upper diameter bound, and that a two-sided sectional curvature bound implies the required Ricci bound. As established above, this line of reasoning is perfectly sound. A uniform bound $|\\sec| \\le K$ implies $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge -(n-1)K$, which, combined with the uniform diameter bound, fulfills the conditions for Gromov's precompactness theorem.\nPart (ii) is correct.\n\nSince both (i) and (ii) are correct, this option is valid.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n### Option B\n\n(i) The example sequence is $\\{M_k\\}$, where $M_k = S^n(1/k)$.\n- **Sectional Curvature**: The sectional curvature of a sphere $S^n(r)$ is constant and equals $1/r^2$. For $M_k = S^n(1/k)$, the sectional curvature is $\\sec_{M_k} \\equiv 1/(1/k)^2 = k^2$. As $k \\to \\infty$, the sectional curvature is not uniformly bounded.\nThe example fails to meet the criterion of uniformly bounded sectional curvature.\nPart (i) is incorrect.\n\n(ii) The reason given is that \"a diameter bound alone guarantees $d_{GH}$-precompactness\". This is false. A uniform lower bound on Ricci curvature (or sectional curvature) is also necessary. For example, consider a sequence of hyperbolic surfaces $\\{M_g\\}$ of genus $g \\to \\infty$. By pinching cycles, one can construct such a sequence with uniformly bounded diameter, but the sequence can have infinitely many non-equivalent subsequential limits (in the topological sense), and thus the set is not precompact.\nPart (ii) is incorrect.\n\nSince both (i) and (ii) are incorrect, this option is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n### Option C\n\n(i) The example sequence is $\\{M_k\\}$, where $M_k = T^2 = S^1(1) \\times S^1(1/k)$ with the flat product metric. The dimension is $n=2$.\n- **Sectional Curvature**: These are flat tori, so their sectional curvature is identically zero, $\\sec_{M_k} \\equiv 0$. This is uniformly bounded, e.g., $|\\sec_{M_k}| \\le 1$.\n- **Diameter**: Using the product formula as in Option A, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{diam}(S^1(1))^2 + \\operatorname{diam}(S^1(1/k))^2} = \\sqrt{\\pi^2 + (\\pi/k)^2}$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) \\to \\pi$. This sequence is uniformly bounded.\n- **Collapsing**: As $k \\to \\infty$, the $S^1(1/k)$ factor shrinks to a point. The sequence $\\{M_k\\}$ converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric to $S^1(1)$. The dimension of the limit is $\\dim(S^1(1)) = 1$, which is less than the dimension of the manifolds $n=2$. This is another canonical example of collapsing.\nPart (i) is correct.\n\n(ii) The reason given is identical in its logical structure to the one in Option A: precompactness follows from Gromov's theorem applied to a class with a uniform lower Ricci bound and a uniform upper diameter bound, and the uniform sectional curvature bound provides the necessary Ricci bound. As noted before, this is correct. Since $\\sec_{M_k} \\equiv 0$, the Ricci curvature is also $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M_k} \\equiv 0$, which is uniformly bounded below.\nPart (ii) is correct.\n\nSince both (i) and (ii) are correct, this option is valid.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n### Option D\n\n(i) The example sequence is $\\{M_k\\}$, a sequence of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $k$ with $\\sec \\equiv -1$ and $\\operatorname{diam}(M_k) \\le \\pi$.\n- **Existence of sequence**: For a closed hyperbolic surface $S_g$ of genus $g$, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem implies its area is $A(S_g) = 2\\pi(2g-2)$. As the genus $k \\to \\infty$, the area $A(M_k) \\to \\infty$. There are various results relating diameter and genus/area for hyperbolic surfaces. For instance, a result by Bavard shows that $\\operatorname{diam}(S_g)$ grows logarithmically with $g$, i.e., $\\operatorname{diam}(S_g) \\sim \\log(g)$. Therefore, the diameter cannot be uniformly bounded by $\\pi$ as $k \\to \\infty$. The sequence of manifolds described in this option does not exist.\nPart (i) is incorrect because it is based on a false premise.\n\n(ii) The reason given is that \"the class is not $d_{GH}$-precompact because collapsing prevents $d_{GH}$-precompactness\". This statement is fundamentally incorrect. Precompactness means every sequence has a convergent subsequence. Collapsing is a possible mode of convergence for sequences in a $d_{GH}$-precompact class. Far from preventing precompactness, collapsing is a phenomenon that occurs within precompact classes of manifolds when a uniform positive lower bound on volume is not present. The given conditions on the (non-existent) sequence, $|\\sec| = 1$ and $\\operatorname{diam} \\le \\pi$, *do* imply precompactness by Gromov's theorem. The reasoning provided is flawed.\nPart (ii) is incorrect.\n\nSince both (i) and (ii) are incorrect, this option is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, Options A and C both provide a correct example of a collapsing sequence under uniform sectional curvature and diameter bounds, and both provide a correct justification for the precompactness of the relevant class of manifolds based on Gromov's theorem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3048470"}]}
