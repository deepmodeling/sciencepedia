All terms and conditions are defined with sufficient rigor to permit a unique solution. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem asks us to identify the space of directions $\\Sigma_o$ at the apex $o$ of a two-dimensional flat cone $C_{\\alpha}$ and to compute its diameter. The cone $C_{\\alpha}$ for an angle $\\alpha \\in (0, 2\\pi]$ is constructed from a sector of the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ by $S_{\\alpha} = \\{ (r, \\theta) \\mid r \\ge 0, 0 \\le \\theta \\le \\alpha \\}$. The cone is the metric space obtained by isometrically identifying the two bounding rays, i.e., for any $r \\ge 0$, the point $(r, 0)$ is identified with the point $(r, \\alpha)$. The apex $o$ of the cone corresponds to the origin $(0, 0)$ of the sector. Since the sector is flat (Euclidean), the resulting cone $C_{\\alpha}$ is an Alexandrov space with curvature bounded below by $0$.\n\nA direction at the apex $o$ corresponds to an equivalence class of geodesic germs starting at $o$. In the sector representation, geodesics emanating from the origin are straight rays. Each such ray can be uniquely specified by an angle $\\theta \\in [0, \\alpha]$. Due to the identification of the boundary rays, the angle $\\theta = 0$ corresponds to the same direction as the angle $\\theta = \\alpha$. Thus, the set of distinct directions $\\mathcal{D}_o$ can be parameterized by the interval $[0, \\alpha)$, or equivalently, by the points of a circle of circumference $\\alpha$.\n\nLet $[\\gamma_1]$ and $[\\gamma_2]$ be two directions in $\\mathcal{D}_o$, represented by rays at angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ in the sector model, where we can take $\\theta_1, \\theta_2 \\in [0, \\alpha]$. Let the corresponding geodesics be parameterized by arc length, so that $\\gamma_1(t)$ is the point with polar coordinates $(t, \\theta_1)$ and $\\gamma_2(t)$ is the point with polar coordinates $(t, \\theta_2)$ for some small $t  0$.\n\nThe angle $\\angle_o(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2)$ is defined by the limit of the Euclidean comparison angle:\n$$\n\\angle_o(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\widetilde{\\angle}\\, \\bar{o}\\,\\overline{\\gamma_1(t)}\\,\\overline{\\gamma_2(t)}\n$$\nLet $\\beta_t = \\widetilde{\\angle}\\, \\bar{o}\\,\\overline{\\gamma_1(t)}\\,\\overline{\\gamma_2(t)}$.

This is the length of the shortest path between the points $\\gamma_1(t)$ and $\\gamma_2(t)$. In the sector model, this corresponds to the minimum of the Euclidean distances between $(t, \\theta_1)$ and all points identified with $(t, \\theta_2)$. The two most direct paths correspond to the straight line segment within the sector (the \"short way\") and the path that crosses the identified seam (the \"long way\").\nThe angular separation between the rays in the sector is $|\\theta_1 - \\theta_2|$. The angular separation \"around the back\" of the cone is $\\alpha - |\\theta_1 - \\theta_2|$.

The effective angle $\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{eff}}$ lies in the interval $[0, \\alpha/2]$. Since the problem specifies $\\alpha \\in (0, 2\\pi]$, we have $\\alpha/2 \\in (0, \\pi]$. Thus, $\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{eff}} \\in [0, \\pi]$. In this interval, the cosine function is injective, so the equality $\\cos(\\beta_t) = \\cos(\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{eff}})$ implies $\\beta_t = \\Delta\\theta_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nThis result for $\\beta_t$ is independent of $t$.

A circle is a complete metric space, so $\\Sigma_o$ is itself isometric to a circle of circumference $\\alpha$.\n\nNow we compute the diameter of $\\Sigma_o$. The diameter of a metric space is the supremum of distances between any two of its points.
