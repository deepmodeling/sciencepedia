For a manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature, the theorem provides a comparison with Euclidean space, which has zero curvature.\n\nLet $(M^{n},g)$ be a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} \\ge 0$. Let $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\text{eucl}})$ be the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, which is the model space with constant sectional curvature $k=0$ and thus Ricci curvature equal to $0$. Let $\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(B(R))$ denote the volume of a ball of radius $R$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The volume of such a ball is given by the formula $\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(B(R)) = \\omega_{n}R^{n}$, where $\\omega_{n}$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem states that for any point $p \\in M$, the function $f:(0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by\n$$\nf(R) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p}(R))}{\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(B(R))} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p}(R))}{\\omega_{n}R^{n}}\n$$\nis a non-increasing function of the radius $R$.\n\nThe non-increasing property of $f(R)$ means that for any two radii $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ such that $0 < R_{1} \\le R_{2}$, we have $f(R_{1}) \\ge f(R_{2})$.\n\nTo derive the doubling inequality, we apply this property to the radii $R_{1} = r$ and $R_{2} = 2r$ for any $r > 0$.

To show that this constant is sharp (i.e., the best possible), we must exhibit a manifold that satisfies the hypotheses for which the inequality becomes an equality, or for which the ratio $\\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p}(2r))}{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_{p}(r))}$ can be arbitrarily close to $2^{n}$.\n\nConsider the Euclidean space $(M^{n}, g) = (\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\text{eucl}})$.
