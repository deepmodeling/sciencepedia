A natural choice is:\n$$\n\\omega^1 = e^{\\phi(x,y)} dx\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^2 = e^{\\phi(x,y)} dy\n$$\nWith this coframe, the metric tensor is indeed $g = (\\omega^1)^2 + (\\omega^2)^2$, and the corresponding orthonormal frame is $\\{E_1, E_2\\}$ where $E_1 = e^{-\\phi}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ and $E_2 = e^{-\\phi}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection is characterized by the connection $1$-forms $\\omega^i_j$, which are determined by the first Cartan structure equation: $d\\omega^i = -\\omega^i_j \\wedge \\omega^j$. For a $2$-dimensional manifold, this system is determined by a single independent connection form, $\\omega^1_2$, because the matrix of connection forms is skew-symmetric, i.e., $\\omega^1_2 = -\\omega^2_1$ and $\\omega^1_1 = \\omega^2_2 = 0$.

For a small, simply connected domain $\\mathcal{D}$, the holonomy transformation resulting from parallel transport around its boundary $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$ corresponds to a rotation by an angle $\\theta$. This angle is given by the integral of the curvature $2$-form over the domain $\\mathcal{D}$.\nThe angle of rotation $\\theta$ of a vector parallel transported along a closed curve $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$ can be calculated as the line integral of the connection $1$-form $\\omega^1_2$ along the curve:\n$$\n\\theta = \\oint_{\\partial\\mathcal{D}} \\omega^1_2\n$$\nBy Stokes' theorem, this is equivalent to the surface integral of the exterior derivative of $\\omega^1_2$ over the region $\\mathcal{D}$ enclosed by the curve:\n$$\n\\theta = \\iint_{\\mathcal{D}} d\\omega^1_2\n$$\nWe have already calculated $d\\omega^1_2 = -(\\alpha+\\beta)dx\\wedge dy$.\nThe domain $\\mathcal{D}$ is the rectangle defined by $x \\in [-a/2, a/2]$ and $y \\in [-b/2, b/2]$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\theta = \\iint_{[-a/2, a/2] \\times [-b/2, b/2]} -(\\alpha+\\beta) \\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nSince the integrand $-(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$\n\\theta = -(\\alpha+\\beta) \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} dx \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} dy\n$$\nThe integral is simply the Euclidean area of the rectangle, which is $a \\times b$.\n$$\n\\theta = -(\\alpha+\\beta) \\left( \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = -(\\alpha+\\beta) (a)(b)\n$$\nThe problem specifies \"leading-order\" angle. For the given quadratic form of $\\phi(x,y)$, the Laplacian $\\Delta\\phi$ is constant. This makes the curvature form component $-(\\alpha+\\beta)$ constant, so the calculation is exact and there are no higher-order terms to consider.

In two dimensions, the holonomy group acts by rotations of the tangent plane (a subgroup of the special orthogonal group in two dimensions, $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$). The Ambrose-Singer theorem states that the holonomy algebra is generated by curvature endomorphisms transported along loops. Concretely, for a sufficiently small loop bounding a region $R$, the holonomy (to first order in the size of the loop and, here, to first order in $\\epsilon$) is the exponential of the integral of the curvature endomorphism over $R$. In dimension $2$, the curvature endomorphism is pointwise the scalar $K(x,y)$ times the standard generator of rotations $J$ in the tangent plane. Thus the holonomy element around a small loop is a rotation by the angle\n$$\n\\theta \\approx \\int_{R} K\\,dA,\n$$\nto first order. The area element is $dA = \\exp\\!\\big(2\\epsilon\\,\\phi(x,y)\\big)\\,dx\\,dy$, but since $K$ is already first order in $\\epsilon$, we can replace $dA$ by $dx\\,dy$ to first order:\n$$\ndA = \\big(1 + 2\\epsilon\\,\\phi(x,y) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2})\\big)\\,dx\\,dy \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad K\\,dA = K\\,dx\\,dy + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2}).\n$$\nTherefore, at first order,\n$$\n\\theta \\approx \\int_{R} K\\,dx\\,dy.\n$$\n\nWe now compute the holonomy rotation angle around $C_{+}$, which bounds the rectangle $R_{+} = [0,\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}] \\times [0,\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}]$. Using the expression for $K$,\n$$\n\\theta_{+} \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} 2\\epsilon\\,\\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\,dx\\,dy = 2\\epsilon \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos(x)\\,dx\\right)\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos(y)\\,dy\\right).\n$$\nWe evaluate the one-dimensional integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos(x)\\,dx = \\sin(x)\\big|_{0}^{\\pi/2} = 1, \\quad \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos(y)\\,dy = \\sin(y)\\big|_{0}^{\\pi/2} = 1.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\n\\theta_{+} \\approx 2\\epsilon \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 2\\epsilon.\n$$\nThis is the holonomy rotation angle around $C_{+}$ in radians, to first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\nFinally, we illustrate the cancellation over a larger region while retaining nontrivial holonomy on subregions. Consider $R_{-} = [0,\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}]\\times[\\tfrac{\\pi}{2},\\pi]$. A similar computation gives\n$$\n\\theta_{-} \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{\\pi/2}^{\\pi} 2\\epsilon\\,\\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\,dx\\,dy = 2\\epsilon \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos(x)\\,dx\\right)\\left(\\int_{\\pi/2}^{\\pi}\\cos(y)\\,dy\\right).\n$$\nWe already have $\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos(x)\\,dx = 1$, and\n$$\n\\int_{\\pi/2}^{\\pi}\\cos(y)\\,dy = \\sin(y)\\big|_{\\pi/2}^{\\pi} = 0 - 1 = -1.\n$$\nThus $\\theta_{-} \\approx 2\\epsilon \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = -2\\epsilon$. The total curvature over $R_{+} \\cup R_{-}$ is\n$$\n\\int_{R_{+}\\cup R_{-}} K\\,dx\\,dy = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\pi} 2\\epsilon\\,\\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\,dx\\,dy = 2\\epsilon \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos(x)\\,dx\\right)\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi}\\cos(y)\\,dy\\right) = 2\\epsilon \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 = 0,\n$$\nwhich shows cancellation over the larger region. Nevertheless, the holonomy angles $\\theta_{+}$ and $\\theta_{-}$ around the individual loops are nonzero and opposite, demonstrating that variable curvature can produce nontrivial holonomy even when total curvature over a larger region cancels.\n\nTherefore, the requested holonomy rotation angle around $C_{+}$, in radians and to first order in $\\epsilon$, is $2\\epsilon$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\epsilon}$$", "id": "3068054"}]}
