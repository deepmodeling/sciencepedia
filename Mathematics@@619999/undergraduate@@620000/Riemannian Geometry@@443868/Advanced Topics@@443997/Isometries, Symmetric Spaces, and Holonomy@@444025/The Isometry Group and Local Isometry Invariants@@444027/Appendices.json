The metric on the target is $h = \\exp(2 f(x,y))(dx^{2} + dy^{2})$, where this should be interpreted as being evaluated in the coordinates of the target space. Let the map be $\\varphi(x_1, x_2) = (y_1, y_2)$. Then $g=\\delta_{ij} dx^i dx^j$ and $h = \\exp(2f(y_1, y_2)) \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} dy^\\alpha dy^\\beta$.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Part 1: PDE System for Local Isometries\n\nA map $\\varphi: (U,g) \\to (V,h)$ is a local isometry if the pullback of the metric $h$ is the metric $g$, i.e., $\\varphi^*h = g$. Let the map $\\varphi$ be given in local coordinates by functions $y^{\\alpha} = \\varphi^{\\alpha}(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n})$.\n\nThe metric tensors are $g = g_{ij}(x) dx^i \\otimes dx^j$ and $h=h_{\\alpha\\beta}(y) dy^\\alpha \\otimes dy^\\beta$. The pullback $\\varphi^*h$ is a tensor on $U$. Its components in the $x$-coordinates are given by the tensorial transformation rule:\n$$\n(\\varphi^*h)_{ij}(x) = h_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi(x)) \\frac{\\partial \\varphi^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi^{\\beta}}{\\partial x^j}\n$$\nHere, Einstein summation convention is used for repeated Greek indices $\\alpha, \\beta$ from $1$ to $n$. The condition $\\varphi^*h=g$ means that the components must be equal for all $i,j$:\n$$\ng_{ij}(x) = h_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi(x)) \\frac{\\partial \\varphi^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi^{\\beta}}{\\partial x^j}\n$$\nThis is the system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that a local isometry must satisfy. The unknowns are the $n$ scalar functions $\\varphi^{\\alpha}(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$. The metric components $g_{ij}(x)$ and $h_{\\alpha\\beta}(y)$ are given functions.\n\nTo determine if the system is overdetermined, we compare the number of unknown functions to the number of scalar equations.\n-   Number of unknown functions: There are $n$ functions, $\\varphi^1, \\dots, \\varphi^n$.\n-   Number of scalar equations: The equation relates symmetric $n \\times n$ matrices, i.e., $(g_{ij}) = ((\\varphi^*h)_{ij})$. A symmetric $n \\times n$ matrix has $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ independent components. Thus, there are $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ scalar equations.\n\nThe system is overdetermined if the number of equations is greater than the number of unknowns:\n$$\n\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > n\n$$\nThis inequality holds if $n+1 > 2$, which means $n > 1$. For $n=1$, we have $1$ equation and $1$ unknown, so the system is determined. For any dimension $n \\ge 2$, the system is overdetermined. For instance, in dimension $n=2$, we have $3$ equations for $2$ unknown functions. In dimension $n=3$, we have $6$ equations for $3$ unknown functions.\n\n### Part 2: The Killing Equation\n\nWe now specialize to the case where the manifolds and metrics are the same, i.e., $(U, g) = (V, h)$, and consider a one-parameter family of isometries $\\varphi_t: U \\to U$ with $\\varphi_0 = \\mathrm{id}$. The condition for each $\\varphi_t$ to be an isometry is:\n$$\ng_{ij}(x) = g_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi_t(x)) \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_t^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_t^{\\beta}}{\\partial x^j}\n$$\nSince this holds for all $t$ in a neighborhood of $0$, its derivative with respect to $t$ must be zero. We take the derivative of the right-hand side and evaluate at $t=0$. Let $X$ be the vector field generating the flow, $X^\\gamma(x) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\varphi_t^\\gamma(x)$. At $t=0$, we have $\\varphi_0(x) = x$, so $\\varphi_0^\\alpha(x) = x^\\alpha$, and $\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_0^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} = \\delta^\\alpha_i$.\nUsing the product rule for differentiation with respect to $t$:\n$$\n0 = \\left[ \\frac{d}{dt} g_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi_t(x)) \\right]_{t=0} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_0^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_0^{\\beta}}{\\partial x^j} + g_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi_0(x)) \\left[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_t^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^i} \\right]_{t=0} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_0^{\\beta}}{\\partial x^j} + g_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi_0(x)) \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_0^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^i} \\left[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_t^{\\beta}}{\\partial x^j} \\right]_{t=0}\n$$\nLet's evaluate each term:\n1.  Using the chain rule: $\\frac{d}{dt} g_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi_t(x)) = \\frac{\\partial g_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial x^\\gamma}(\\varphi_t(x)) \\frac{d\\varphi_t^\\gamma}{dt}$. At $t=0$, this becomes $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial x^\\gamma}(x) X^\\gamma$. The first term is thus $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial x^\\gamma}(x) X^\\gamma \\delta^\\alpha_i \\delta^\\beta_j = \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^\\gamma} X^\\gamma$.\n2.  Swapping derivatives: $\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_t^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{d\\varphi_t^\\alpha}{dt}$. At $t=0$, this is $\\frac{\\partial X^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i}$. The second term is $g_{\\alpha\\beta}(x) \\frac{\\partial X^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} \\delta^\\beta_j = g_{j\\alpha}(x) \\frac{\\partial X^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i}$.\n3.  Similarly, the third term is $g_{\\alpha\\beta}(x) \\delta^\\alpha_i \\frac{\\partial X^\\beta}{\\partial x^j} = g_{i\\beta}(x) \\frac{\\partial X^\\beta}{\\partial x^j}$.\n\nSumming the terms and relabeling dummy indices:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} X^k + g_{jk} \\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^i} + g_{ik} \\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^j}\n$$\nThis expression is the component form of the Lie derivative of the metric $g$ with respect to the vector field $X$, $(\\mathcal{L}_X g)_{ij}$. So the condition is $\\mathcal{L}_X g = 0$.\nTo express this in terms of the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$, we use the identity $(\\mathcal{L}_X g)_{ij} = \\nabla_i X_j + \\nabla_j X_i$, where $X_j = g_{jk} X^k$ are the covariant components of $X$.\nThe derivation is as follows:\n$$\n\\nabla_i X_j + \\nabla_j X_i = \\nabla_i(g_{jk}X^k) + \\nabla_j(g_{ik}X^k)\n$$\nUsing the product rule and metric compatibility ($\\nabla g = 0$):\n$$\n= ( \\nabla_i g_{jk} ) X^k + g_{jk} \\nabla_i X^k + ( \\nabla_j g_{ik} ) X^k + g_{ik} \\nabla_j X^k\n$$\n$$\n= g_{jk} \\nabla_i X^k + g_{ik} \\nabla_j X^k\n$$\nIn coordinates, $\\nabla_i X^k = \\partial_i X^k + \\Gamma^k_{i\\ell} X^\\ell$. So,\n$$\n= g_{jk}(\\partial_i X^k + \\Gamma^k_{i\\ell} X^\\ell) + g_{ik}(\\partial_j X^k + \\Gamma^k_{j\\ell} X^\\ell)\n$$\n$$\n= g_{jk}\\partial_i X^k + g_{ik}\\partial_j X^k + (g_{jk}\\Gamma^k_{i\\ell} + g_{ik}\\Gamma^k_{j\\ell}) X^\\ell\n$$\nThe Christoffel symbols satisfy the relation $g_{jk}\\Gamma^k_{i\\ell} + g_{ik}\\Gamma^k_{j\\ell} = \\partial_\\ell g_{ij}$. So the expression becomes:\n$$\n= g_{jk}\\partial_i X^k + g_{ik}\\partial_j X^k + (\\partial_\\ell g_{ij}) X^\\ell = (\\mathcal{L}_X g)_{ij}\n$$\nThus, the infinitesimal isometry condition $\\mathcal{L}_X g = 0$ is equivalent to the Killing equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_i X_j + \\nabla_j X_i = 0\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Application to a 2D Case\n\nWe are given two metrics on subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^2$: the Euclidean metric $g=dx^2+dy^2$ and a conformally flat metric $h = \\exp(2 f(x,y)) (dx^2+dy^2)$, where $f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$. We are told there exists a local isometry $\\varphi: (U,g) \\to (U,h)$.\n\nA fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that local isometries preserve the Riemann curvature tensor. Consequently, all scalar quantities derived from it, such as the scalar curvature and, in dimension $2$, the Gaussian curvature, must be preserved. If $\\varphi$ is a local isometry, then for any point $p \\in U$, the Gaussian curvature of $g$ at $p$, denoted $K_g(p)$, must equal the Gaussian curvature of $h$ at the image point $\\varphi(p)$, denoted $K_h(\\varphi(p))$.\n$$\nK_g(p) = K_h(\\varphi(p))\n$$\nFirst, we compute the Gaussian curvature of the metric $g = dx^2+dy^2$. This is the standard flat metric on the Euclidean plane. Its Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere.\n$$\nK_g = 0\n$$\nTherefore, we must have $K_h(\\varphi(p)) = 0$ for all $p \\in U$. Since $\\varphi$ is a local isometry, it is a local diffeomorphism, meaning its image $\\varphi(U)$ is an open set. This implies that the Gaussian curvature $K_h$ must be zero on an open set. Since $f$ is a polynomial, the metric $h$ is analytic, and thus $K_h$ must be zero everywhere in its domain of definition.\n\nNext, we compute the Gaussian curvature $K_h$ for the metric $h = \\lambda(x,y)(dx^2+dy^2)$ where the conformal factor is $\\lambda(x,y) = \\exp(2f(x,y))$. The general formula for the Gaussian curvature of such a metric is:\n$$\nK_h = -\\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\Delta (\\ln \\lambda)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is the standard Laplacian.\nIn our case, $\\ln \\lambda = \\ln(\\exp(2f(x,y))) = 2f(x,y)$. So,\n$$\nK_h = -\\frac{1}{2\\exp(2f)} \\Delta (2f) = -\\frac{1}{\\exp(2f)} \\Delta f\n$$\nThe condition $K_h=0$ implies that we must have $\\Delta f = 0$, since $\\exp(-2f)$ is never zero.\nNow we compute the Laplacian of $f(x,y) = ax^2+bxy+cy^2$:\n-   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2ax+by$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2a$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = bx+2cy$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2c$\n\nThe Laplacian is $\\Delta f = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2a+2c = 2(a+c)$.\nThe condition $\\Delta f = 0$ thus leads to:\n$$\n2(a+c) = 0 \\implies a+c = 0\n$$\nThis result stems directly from the invariance of Gaussian curvature. The problem provides additional information: $\\varphi(0,0)=(0,0)$ and $D\\varphi(0,0)=I$, and directs us to use the PDE system from Part 1. This extra information is not superfluous; it confirms the consistency of the setup and highlights the mechanism through which curvature invariance is enforced at the level of the PDE system. By expanding the isometry equations from Part 1 in a Taylor series around the origin, one can show that the given conditions on $\\varphi$ force the metric components $g_{ij}$ and $(\\varphi^*h)_{ij}$ and their first derivatives to match at the origin. The condition that their second derivatives must also match is equivalent to the condition that the curvature tensors $R_g$ and $R_h$ are equal at the origin. Since $R_g=0$, we must have $R_h(0)=0$. For a 2D conformally flat metric, this is equivalent to $K_h(0)=0$, which yields $2(a+c)=0$.

At the point $\\phi(p) = (x, y+a)$, they are $g_{11}(x,y+a)=\\exp(2x)$ and $g_{22}(x,y+a)=\\exp(2x)$.\n$(\\phi^{*}g)_{11}(x,y) = g_{11}(\\phi(p))(\\frac{\\partial\\phi^1}{\\partial x})^2 = \\exp(2x)(1)^2 = \\exp(2x) = g_{11}(x,y)$.\n$(\\phi^{*}g)_{22}(x,y) = g_{22}(\\phi(p))(\\frac{\\partial\\phi^2}{\\partial y})^2 = \\exp(2x)(1)^2 = \\exp(2x) = g_{22}(x,y)$.\n$(\\phi^{*}g)_{12}(x,y) = g_{11}(\\phi(p))\\frac{\\partial\\phi^1}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial\\phi^1}{\\partial y} + g_{22}(\\phi(p))\\frac{\\partial\\phi^2}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial\\phi^2}{\\partial y} = \\exp(2x)(1)(0) + \\exp(2x)(0)(1) = 0 = g_{12}(x,y)$.\nSince $(\\phi^{*}g)_{ij}=g_{ij}$, the map $\\phi$ is an isometry.\nA fundamental property of isometries is that they map geodesics to geodesics. Since $\\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic and $\\phi$ is an isometry, the transformed curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = (\\phi\\circ\\gamma)(t)$ must also be a geodesic. This means it satisfies the geodesic equation:\n$$\n\\ddot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}^{i}(t) + \\Gamma^{i}_{jk}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\,\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}^{j}(t)\\,\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}^{k}(t)=0.\n$$\n\n**4.

Let's denote its components by $(\\tilde{x}(t), \\tilde{y}(t)) = (\\ln(t), a)$.\nIts derivatives are:\n$\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(t) = (\\dot{\\tilde{x}}(t), \\dot{\\tilde{y}}(t)) = (1/t, 0)$.\n$\\ddot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(t) = (\\ddot{\\tilde{x}}(t), \\ddot{\\tilde{y}}(t)) = (-1/t^2, 0)$.\nThe Christoffel symbols are evaluated at $\\phi(\\gamma(t)) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = (\\ln(t), a)$. Since the symbols only depend on the $x$-coordinate, their values are the same as before.\n$\\Gamma^{1}_{11}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = 1$, $\\Gamma^{1}_{22}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = -1$, $\\Gamma^{2}_{12}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = 1$. The others are $0$.\n\nLet's compute the components $R^1(t)$ and $R^2(t)$:\nFor $i=1$:\n$$\nR^{1}(t) = \\ddot{\\tilde{x}}(t) + \\Gamma^{1}_{11}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\tilde{x}}(t)^2 + 2\\Gamma^{1}_{12}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\tilde{x}}(t)\\dot{\\tilde{y}}(t) + \\Gamma^{1}_{22}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\tilde{y}}(t)^2\n$$\n$$\nR^{1}(t) = -\\frac{1}{t^2} + (1)\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)^2 + 2(0)\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)(0) + (-1)(0)^2 = -\\frac{1}{t^2} + \\frac{1}{t^2} = 0.\n$$\nFor $i=2$:\n$$\nR^{2}(t) = \\ddot{\\tilde{y}}(t) + \\Gamma^{2}_{11}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\tilde{x}}(t)^2 + 2\\Gamma^{2}_{12}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\tilde{x}}(t)\\dot{\\tilde{y}}(t) + \\Gamma^{2}_{22}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\tilde{y}}(t)^2\n$$\n$$\nR^{2}(t) = 0 + (0)\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)^2 + 2(1)\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)(0) + (0)(0)^2 = 0.\n$$\nBoth components are zero. Thus, the row vector $R(t)$ is $(0, 0)$.

Derivation of the Killing Vector Fields\n\nA Killing vector field is the infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter group of isometries. The rotations about the $x, y, z$ axes in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ form one-parameter groups of isometries of $S^2$. The generators of these rotations in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ are given by the matrices:\n$$\nL_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ -1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  0 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe one-parameter group of isometries on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ generated by $L_k$ (for $k \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$) is $\\Phi_t^k(P) = \\exp(t L_k) P$. This action restricts to $S^2$. The corresponding Killing vector field $X_k$ at a point $p \\in S^2$ is given by the time derivative of the flow at $t=0$:\n$$\nX_k|_p = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi_t^k(p) = L_k p\n$$\nThe resulting vector $X_k|_p$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ tangent to the sphere at $p$. We need to express this vector in the local coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_r, \\partial_\\theta\\}$. The basis vectors are tangent to the sphere and are computed by differentiating the embedding $p(r,\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\partial_r = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = (\\cos r \\cos\\theta, \\cos r \\sin\\theta, -\\sin r)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_\\theta = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta} = (-\\sin r \\sin\\theta, \\sin r \\cos\\theta, 0)\n$$\nThe metric components in this basis are $g(\\partial_r, \\partial_r) = \\partial_r \\cdot \\partial_r = 1$, $g(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_\\theta) = \\partial_\\theta \\cdot \\partial_\\theta = \\sin^2 r$, and $g(\\partial_r, \\partial_\\theta) = \\partial_r \\cdot \\partial_\\theta = 0$.
