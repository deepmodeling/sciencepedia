The answer must be a single row matrix as specified.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the general form and dimension of the space of parallel Jacobi fields along a closed geodesic on a flat two-dimensional torus, $T^2$.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is a vector field along $\\gamma$ that satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ represents the Levi-Civita connection and $R$ is the Riemannian curvature tensor. The problem specifies that the torus $T^2 = \\mathbb{R}^{2} / \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is flat, which means its curvature tensor is identically zero, $R \\equiv 0$. In this case, the Jacobi equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t) = 0\n$$\nThe problem further specifies that we are interested in *parallel* Jacobi fields. A vector field $J(t)$ is defined as parallel along $\\gamma(t)$ if its covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ vanishes identically:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t) = 0\n$$\nIf a vector field is parallel, its second covariant derivative along the same direction is also zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t)) = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}(0) = 0$. This means that on a flat manifold, any parallel vector field along a geodesic is automatically a Jacobi field. Our task thus reduces to finding all parallel vector fields along the specified closed geodesic $\\gamma$.\n\nTo facilitate the analysis, we work in the universal covering space of the torus, which is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with its standard flat metric. The covariant derivative $\\nabla$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with standard Cartesian coordinates corresponds to the ordinary differentiation of the vector components. The geodesic $\\gamma$ on the torus is the projection of a straight line $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = x_{0} + tv$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where $v = (p,q)$ is a constant vector. The velocity vector of this lifted geodesic is $\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(t) = v$, which is a constant vector field along $\\tilde{\\gamma}$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{J}(t)$ be a vector field along $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ in the covering space. The condition for $\\tilde{J}(t)$ to be parallel along $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}} \\tilde{J}(t) = 0$. In the Euclidean setting of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this equation becomes a simple ordinary differential equation for the vector-valued function $\\tilde{J}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\tilde{J}(t) = 0\n$$\nThe solution is that $\\tilde{J}(t)$ must be a constant vector, i.e., $\\tilde{J}(t) = C$ for some vector $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that is constant with respect to the parameter $t$.\n\nNext, we must ensure that such a vector field $\\tilde{J}(t)$ on the covering space projects to a well-defined vector field $J(t)$ on the torus $T^{2}$. A field on the cover descends to a well-defined field on the quotient manifold if and only if it is equivariant under the action of the deck group. The geodesic $\\gamma$ is closed, which is a consequence of $v$ being an integer vector. The problem statement indicates that the deck transformation $\\tau_v: x \\mapsto x+v$ corresponding to the vector $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ is responsible for closing the geodesic. Specifically, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t+1) = x_0 + (t+1)v = (x_0+tv)+v = \\tau_v(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$. The projection $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ satisfies $\\pi \\circ \\tau_v = \\pi$, so $\\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t+1)) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$, confirming the periodicity.\n\nFor $\\tilde{J}(t)$ to descend to a field on $T^2$, it must satisfy the equivariance condition with respect to $\\tau_v$. This condition relates the vector at a point $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ to the vector at the transformed point $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t+1)$ via the differential of the deck transformation:\n$$\nd(\\tau_v)_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)}(\\tilde{J}(t)) = \\tilde{J}(t+1)\n$$\nThe deck transformation $\\tau_v(x) = x+v$ is a translation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Its differential (or Jacobian matrix), $d(\\tau_v)_x$, is the identity map $Id: T_x\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T_{x+v}\\mathbb{R}^2$ for any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, applying the differential to $\\tilde{J}(t)$ simply yields $\\tilde{J}(t)$. The equivariance condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\tilde{J}(t) = \\tilde{J}(t+1)\n$$\nWe have already established that for $\\tilde{J}(t)$ to be a parallel field, it must be a constant vector, $\\tilde{J}(t)=C$. Substituting this into the well-definedness condition, we get $C=C$. This is a tautology, which means it holds for any constant vector $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThis demonstrates that any constant vector field along the line $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ corresponds to a well-defined parallel Jacobi field along the closed geodesic $\\gamma$ on $T^2$. The space of such fields is therefore the space of all constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is a real vector space isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ itself. The dimension of this vector space is equal to the dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is $2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the general form of such a field in terms of the given vectors $v=(p,q)$ and $v^{\\perp}=(-q,p)$. The vector $v$ is primitive, meaning $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, so it is non-zero. The vector $v^{\\perp}$ is also non-zero and is orthogonal to $v$, as their dot product is $\\langle v, v^{\\perp} \\rangle = p(-q) + q(p) = 0$. In a $2$-dimensional space, two non-zero orthogonal vectors are necessarily linearly independent and thus form a basis.\nTherefore, any constant vector $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, which represents a lifted parallel Jacobi field, can be expressed as a unique linear combination of $v$ and $v^{\\perp}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{J}(t) = C = a_1 v + a_2 v^{\\perp}\n$$\nfor arbitrary real scalar coefficients $a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is the general form of a parallel Jacobi field along $\\gamma$.\n\nIn summary, the dimension of the vector space of parallel Jacobi fields along $\\gamma$ is $2$, and the general form of such a field (represented by its lift to the universal cover) is $a_1 v + a_2 v^{\\perp}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2  a_{1}v + a_{2}v^{\\perp} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3062615"}, {"introduction": "Having established the baseline in a flat space, we now introduce negative curvature to see its dramatic effect on Jacobi fields.

The metric on $M$ is the product metric. A point in $M$ is an ordered pair $p=(p_1, p_2)$ with $p_i \\in M_i$. The tangent space at $p$ is the direct sum $T_p M = T_{p_1} M_1 \\oplus T_{p_2} M_2$.

Given vector fields $X=(X_1, X_2)$ and $Y=(Y_1, Y_2)$ along a curve $c(t)=(c_1(t), c_2(t))$, the covariant derivative is $\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}Y = (\\nabla^1_{\\dot{c}_1}Y_1, \\nabla^2_{\\dot{c}_2}Y_2)$, where $\\nabla^i$ is the connection on $M_i$.

The curvature tensor is given by $R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y) = -(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)$.\nLet's drop the superscripts and subscripts for now and analyze the equation on $\\mathbb{H}^2$ along a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma$:\n$\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$.\nThe curvature term becomes $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = -(\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma})$. Since $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = 1$.

Let $E(t)$ be a unit vector field normal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ and parallel along $\\gamma(t)$ (i.e., $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E=0$). Such a field exists because the dimension is $2$. The pair $\\{\\dot{\\gamma}(t), E(t)\\}$ forms a parallel orthonormal frame along $\\gamma(t)$.\nWe write $J(t) = a(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + b(t)E(t)$.\nThe normal component is $J^{\\perp}(t) = b(t)E(t)$.\nLet's compute the second covariant derivative:\n$\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = a'(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + a(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} + b'(t)E(t) + b(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E$.\nSince $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. Since $E$ is parallel, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E = 0$.\nSo, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = a'(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + b'(t)E(t)$.\nDifferentiating again:\n$\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = a''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + a'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} + b''(t)E(t) + b'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E = a''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + b''(t)E(t)$.\n\nSubstituting into the Jacobi equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J - J^{\\perp} = 0$:\n$(a''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + b''(t)E(t)) - b(t)E(t) = 0$.\n$a''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + (b''(t) - b(t))E(t) = 0$.\nSince $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ and $E(t)$ are orthogonal and non-zero, their scalar coefficients must be zero:\n$a''(t) = 0 \\implies a(t) = c_1 t + c_2$ for some constants $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$b''(t) - b(t) = 0$. The general solution is $b(t) = c_3 \\cosh(t) + c_4 \\sinh(t)$ for constants $c_3, c_4 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, the general form of a Jacobi field along a unit-speed geodesic in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is\n$J(t) = (c_1 t + c_2)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + (c_3 \\cosh(t) + c_4 \\sinh(t))E(t)$.\n\nThe general form of a Jacobi field $J(t) = (J_1(t), J_2(t))$ on $M = \\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$ is therefore given by applying this form to each component. Let $\\{\\dot{\\gamma}_1, E_1\\}$ and $\\{\\dot{\\gamma}_2, E_2\\}$ be parallel orthonormal frames along $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ respectively.\n$J_1(t) = (c_{11} t + c_{12})\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) + (c_{13} \\cosh(t) + c_{14} \\sinh(t))E_1(t)$\n$J_2(t) = (c_{21} t + c_{22})\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t) + (c_{23} \\cosh(t) + c_{24} \\sinh(t))E_2(t)$\nThis provides the general form of a Jacobi field along $\\gamma(t)$, which depends on $8$ arbitrary constants. This answers the first part of the problem's request.\n\nNext, we must find the dimension of the subspace of these fields that are parallel, i.e., satisfy $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J = 0$.\nThe condition $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J=0$ decomposes into $\\nabla^1_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1}J_1=0$ and $\\nabla^2_{\\dot{\\gamma}_2}J_2=0$. Let us analyze the condition for one component, say $J_1(t)$.\nFrom our earlier calculation, $\\nabla^1_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1}J_1 = a_1'(t)\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) + b_1'(t)E_1(t)$, where $J_1(t) = a_1(t)\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) + b_1(t)E_1(t)$.\nSetting this to zero requires $a_1'(t)=0$ and $b_1'(t)=0$ for all $t$.\n$a_1(t) = c_{11}t + c_{12} \\implies a_1'(t) = c_{11}$. So, $c_{11} = 0$.\n$b_1(t) = c_{13}\\cosh(t) + c_{14}\\sinh(t) \\implies b_1'(t) = c_{13}\\sinh(t) + c_{14}\\cosh(t)$.\nThe condition $c_{13}\\sinh(t) + c_{14}\\cosh(t) = 0$ for all $t$ implies $c_{13}=0$ and $c_{14}=0$. This is because $\\sinh(t)$ and $\\cosh(t)$ are linearly independent functions. For instance, at $t=0$, we get $c_{14}=0$. Then $c_{13}\\sinh(t)=0$ for all $t \\neq 0$, which means $c_{13}=0$.\n\nThus, for $J_1(t)$ to be a parallel Jacobi field, we must have $c_{11}=c_{13}=c_{14}=0$. The only remaining parameter is $c_{12}$. The field must be of the form $J_1(t) = c_{12}\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$. This is a one-dimensional space of vector fields along $\\gamma_1$, spanned by $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$.\n\nSimilarly, for the second component, a parallel Jacobi field $J_2(t)$ along $\\gamma_2(t)$ must be of the form $J_2(t) = c_{22}\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)$ for some constant $c_{22}$. This is also a one-dimensional space.\n\nA parallel Jacobi field $J(t)$ on $M$ must therefore have the form\n$J(t) = (J_1(t), J_2(t)) = (c_{12}\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), c_{22}\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t))$.\nThis can be written as a linear combination of two vector fields:\n$J(t) = c_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), 0) + c_{22}(0, \\dot{\\gamma}_2(t))$.\nThe vector space of such fields is spanned by the two fields $V_1(t) = (\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), 0)$ and $V_2(t) = (0, \\dot{\\gamma}_2(t))$. These two fields are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the vector space of parallel Jacobi fields along $\\gamma(t)$ is $2$.\nThis dimension is also known as the rank of the Riemannian manifold $M = \\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$.

Since $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ lie in $S$ and start at $p$, their initial velocity vectors $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)$ must be tangent to $S$ at $p$. Since these two vectors are linearly independent (because $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$), they span the tangent plane to the surface $S$ at $p$. That is, $\\sigma = T_pS$. Because $S$ is a flat surface, its intrinsic curvature is zero everywhere. Since $S$ is also totally geodesic, the sectional curvature of $M$ for any plane tangent to $S$ must be zero. In particular, for the tangent plane $\\sigma = T_pS$, we must have $K_M(\\sigma) = 0$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $J$ is the Jacobi field along $\\gamma_1$ obtained by varying the initial direction from $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0)$ toward $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)$ with $J(0)=0$, then $J''(t) = 0$ and $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\in [0,a]$.**\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ describes the infinitesimal behavior of a variation of nearby geodesics. The Jacobi field mentioned is generated by a variation of geodesics $\\alpha_s(t)$ which all start at $p$ and whose initial velocities $\\dot{\\alpha}_s(0)$ vary from $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0)$ (at $s=0$) towards $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)$. This variation can be constructed to take place entirely within the 2-plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0), \\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)\\}$.\nSince the surface $S$ (with tangent plane $\\sigma$ at $p$) is totally geodesic, all geodesics starting at $p$ with initial velocity in $\\sigma$ remain in $S$ for all time. Thus, the entire variation $\\alpha_s(t)$ takes place within $S$. This implies that for any $t$, the Jacobi field vector $J(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}|_{s=0} \\alpha_s(t)$ is tangent to $S$ at the point $\\gamma_1(t)$. The velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ is also tangent to $S$.\nThe Jacobi equation is $J''(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) = 0$, where $J''$ is the second covariant derivative of $J$ along $\\gamma_1$.\nThe term $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle$ is related to the sectional curvature $K(\\pi_t)$ of the plane $\\pi_t = \\operatorname{span}\\{J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)\\}$. Specifically, $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle = -K(\\pi_t) \\|\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) \\wedge J(t)\\|^2$.\nSince $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ are both tangent to the flat, totally geodesic surface $S$, the plane $\\pi_t$ is a tangent plane to $S$. Therefore, the sectional curvature $K(\\pi_t)$ must be $0$ for all $t \\in [0, a]$. This directly implies that $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle \\equiv 0$.\nFurthermore, since $S$ is a flat totally geodesic surface, the curvature tensor of $M$ restricted to tangent vectors of $S$ is zero. That is, for any vectors $U, V, W$ tangent to $S$ at some point, $R(U,V)W = 0$. In our case, $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ are tangent to $S$ for all $t$. Thus, the curvature term $R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ is identically the zero vector.\nThe Jacobi equation then simplifies to $J''(t) + 0 = 0$, which is $J''(t)=0$.\nBoth claims in the option are correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Equality can hold on a nondegenerate hinge in a simply connected space of constant negative curvature for a unique nonzero pair $(a,b)$ and angle $\\theta$.**\n\nLet $M$ be a simply connected space of constant negative curvature, $K \\equiv -k^2$ for some constant $k0$. For the equality $c = \\tilde{c}$ to hold, the geodesic hinge must span a flat ($K=0$) totally geodesic surface. However, in a manifold where the sectional curvature of *every* 2-plane is strictly negative, it is impossible for a totally geodesic surface to be flat. Any 2-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold must have the same constant sectional curvature as the ambient space, i.e., $-k^2$. Therefore, no such flat surface can exist.\nThis means that in a manifold of strictly negative curvature, the inequality is always strict: $c  \\tilde{c}$ for any non-degenerate hinge. The equality can never hold. The statement that it can hold for a \"unique\" pair is therefore false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Equality implies only that the angle at $p$ equals its Euclidean comparison angle, but it provides no information about the curvature of $M$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement is misleading. The angle at $p$ *is* the angle of the Euclidean comparison hinge by definition. The comparison theorem relates the side lengths and the other two angles. However, the second part of the statement is definitively false. As established in the analysis of options A and B, the equality $c=\\tilde{c}$ provides very specific and crucial information about the curvature of $M$: it forces the sectional curvature of the 2-plane spanned by the hinge to be zero at the vertex $p$. This contradicts the claim that it provides \"no information about the curvature\".\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Equality forces the entire manifold $M$ to be flat.**\n\nThe equality forces the specific 2-dimensional surface containing the triangle to be flat and totally geodesic. It does not impose conditions on curvatures of planes that are not tangent to this surface. To disprove this statement, we can provide a counterexample.\nConsider the Riemannian product manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$, where $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the Euclidean plane and $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is the hyperbolic plane with constant curvature $-1$. The sectional curvature of $M$ for a plane spanned by vectors tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}^2$ factor is $0$. The sectional curvature for a plane spanned by vectors tangent to the $\\mathbb{H}^2$ factor is $-1$. For a mixed plane (one vector from each factor), the curvature is $0$. Therefore, the sectional curvature of $M$ satisfies $K \\le 0$.\nNow, choose a point $p=(p_{\\mathbb{R}}, p_{H}) \\in M$. Consider two geodesics $\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2$ that lie entirely within the submanifold $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\{p_{H}\\}$. This submanifold is isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and is totally geodesic in $M$. Any geodesic triangle within this submanifold will be a normal Euclidean triangle, so the equality $c=\\tilde{c}$ will hold. However, the manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$ is not flat, as it contains planes with sectional curvature $-1$.\nThus, equality for one hinge does not force the entire manifold to be flat.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3062625"}]}
