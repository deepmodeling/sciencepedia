It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in differential geometry that concerns a standard object, the unit sphere $S^n$. The problem asks for the derivation of fundamental geometric properties—the Riemann curvature tensor, sectional curvature, and covariant derivative of the curvature tensor—starting from first principles related to hypersurfaces. All terms are well-defined, and the premises are factually correct.\n\nWe begin by considering the unit sphere $S^{n}=\\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : |x|=1\\}$ as a hypersurface embedded in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $\\bar{g}$ and $\\bar{\\nabla}$ be the standard Euclidean metric and the flat Levi-Civita connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, respectively. The metric $g$ on $S^n$ is the restriction of $\\bar{g}$, i.e., $g_p(X,Y) = \\bar{g}(X,Y)$ for all $X,Y \\in T_pS^n$.\n\nThe Gauss formula relates the ambient connection $\\bar{\\nabla}$ to the induced connection $\\nabla$ on $S^n$. For any vector fields $X, Y$ tangent to $S^n$, it is given by:\n$$ \\bar{\\nabla}_X Y = \\nabla_X Y + \\mathrm{II}(X,Y) $$\nwhere $\\nabla_X Y$ is the tangential component of $\\bar{\\nabla}_X Y$ (and is the Levi-Civita connection on $S^n$), and $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y)$ is the normal component, known as the second fundamental form.\n\nAt any point $p \\in S^n$, the outward-pointing unit normal vector is $\\nu(p) = p$. The second fundamental form is related to the shape operator $S: T_pS^n \\to T_pS^n$ by the formula $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = g(S(X),Y)\\nu$. The shape operator is defined by the Weingarten equation, which for a hypersurface simplifies to $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu = -S(X)$.\n\nTo find $S(X)$, we compute $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu$. We can extend the normal vector field $\\nu(p)=p$ to the position vector field $\\tilde{\\nu}(q)=q$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In Cartesian coordinates, $\\tilde{\\nu}(x_1, \\dots, x_{n+1}) = (x_1, \\dots, x_{n+1})$. The covariant derivative $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\tilde{\\nu}$ is the directional derivative of $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in the direction $X$. The Jacobian matrix of $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is the identity matrix, so for any vector $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we have $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\tilde{\\nu} = X$. Since $X$ is a tangent vector to $S^n$ at $p$, $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu = X$.\nFrom the Weingarten equation, we have $X = -S(X)$, which implies that the shape operator is the negative of the identity map: $S(X) = -X$.\n\nNow we can determine the second fundamental form:\n$$ \\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = g(S(X),Y)\\nu = g(-X,Y)\\nu = -g(X,Y)\\nu $$\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of the submanifold $S^n$ is related to the curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by the Gauss equation. For any tangent vectors $X,Y,Z,W \\in T_pS^n$, the equation is:\n$$ g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = \\bar{g}(\\bar{R}(X,Y)Z,W) + \\bar{g}(\\mathrm{II}(X,W),\\mathrm{II}(Y,Z)) - \\bar{g}(\\mathrm{II}(X,Z),\\mathrm{II}(Y,W)) $$\nThe ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is flat, so its curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ is identically zero. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = \\bar{g}(\\mathrm{II}(X,W),\\mathrm{II}(Y,Z)) - \\bar{g}(\\mathrm{II}(X,Z),\\mathrm{II}(Y,W)) $$\nWe substitute our expression for the second fundamental form. Note that $\\bar{g}(\\nu,\\nu)=1$.\n$$ \\bar{g}(\\mathrm{II}(A,B), \\mathrm{II}(C,D)) = \\bar{g}(-g(A,B)\\nu, -g(C,D)\\nu) = g(A,B)g(C,D)\\bar{g}(\\nu,\\nu) = g(A,B)g(C,D) $$\nApplying this to the Gauss equation:\n$$ g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) $$\nThis equation must hold for all $W \\in T_pS^n$. The vector $V = g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y$ has the property that $g(V,W) = g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W)$. By the non-degeneracy of the metric $g$, this uniquely determines $R(X,Y)Z$. Thus, we obtain the explicit pointwise formula for the Riemann curvature tensor:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y $$\nThis expression depends solely on the metric $g$ and the tangent vectors, as required.\n\nNext, we compute the sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of an arbitrary $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_pS^n$. Let $\\{X, Y\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\sigma$, so that $g(X,X)=1$, $g(Y,Y)=1$, and $g(X,Y)=0$. The sectional curvature is given by $K(\\sigma) = g(R(X,Y)Y, X)$.\nUsing our derived formula for $R$:\n$$ R(X,Y)Y = g(Y,Y)X - g(X,Y)Y = (1)X - (0)Y = X $$\nTherefore, the sectional curvature is:\n$$ K(\\sigma) = g(X,X) = 1 $$\nSince this holds for any point $p \\in S^n$ and any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_pS^n$, the sphere $S^n$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$.\n\nFinally, we determine whether $\\nabla R=0$. A Riemannian manifold with $\\nabla R=0$ is called a locally symmetric space. A space of constant sectional curvature is a classic example of such a space. We verify this directly. The covariant derivative of the tensor $R$ is defined by:\n$$ (\\nabla_W R)(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_W(R(X,Y)Z) - R(\\nabla_W X, Y)Z - R(X, \\nabla_W Y)Z - R(X,Y)\\nabla_W Z $$\nWe compute the first term using our expression for $R$ and the product rule, noting that $\\nabla g=0$ implies $W(g(A,B)) = g(\\nabla_W A, B) + g(A, \\nabla_W B)$:\n$$ \\nabla_W(R(X,Y)Z) = \\nabla_W(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y) $$\n$$ = (W g(Y,Z))X + g(Y,Z)\\nabla_W X - (W g(X,Z))Y - g(X,Z)\\nabla_W Y $$\n$$ = (g(\\nabla_W Y, Z) + g(Y, \\nabla_W Z))X + g(Y,Z)\\nabla_W X - (g(\\nabla_W X, Z) + g(X, \\nabla_W Z))Y - g(X,Z)\\nabla_W Y $$\nThe remaining terms are computed by substituting the arguments into the formula for $R$:\n$$ R(\\nabla_W X, Y)Z = g(Y,Z)\\nabla_W X - g(\\nabla_W X, Z)Y $$\n$$ R(X, \\nabla_W Y)Z = g(\\nabla_W Y, Z)X - g(X,Z)\\nabla_W Y $$\n$$ R(X,Y)\\nabla_W Z = g(Y, \\nabla_W Z)X - g(X, \\nabla_W Z)Y $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of $(\\nabla_W R)(X,Y)Z$:\n\\begin{align*} (\\nabla_W R)(X,Y)Z = & \\phantom{+} [ (g(\\nabla_W Y, Z) + g(Y, \\nabla_W Z))X + g(Y,Z)\\nabla_W X - (g(\\nabla_W X, Z) + g(X, \\nabla_W Z))Y - g(X,Z)\\nabla_W Y ] \\\\ & - [ g(Y,Z)\\nabla_W X - g(\\nabla_W X, Z)Y ] \\\\ & - [ g(\\nabla_W Y, Z)X - g(X,Z)\\nabla_W Y ] \\\\ & - [ g(Y, \\nabla_W Z)X - g(X, \\nabla_W Z)Y ] \\end{align*}\nCollecting terms, we see that they cancel completely. For example, the terms multiplying the vector $X$ sum to $(g(\\nabla_W Y, Z) + g(Y, \\nabla_W Z)) - g(\\nabla_W Y, Z) - g(Y, \\nabla_W Z) = 0$. Similarly, all other terms cancel.\nTherefore, $(\\nabla_W R)(X,Y)Z = 0$ for all vector fields $X,Y,Z,W$. We conclude that $\\nabla R=0$ on $S^n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y}$$", "id": "3056844"}, {"introduction": "The analytical condition $\\nabla R=0$, which we established for the sphere, possesses a profound geometric meaning that gives locally symmetric spaces their name.

Given $x = \\exp_{p}(v)$, we have $x = p + v$. Solving for $v$ yields:\n$$ v = \\exp_{p}^{-1}(x) = x - p $$\n\nNow, we can construct the geodesic symmetry map $s_{p}(x)$.\n$s_{p}(x) = \\exp_{p}(-\\exp_{p}^{-1}(x))$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\exp_{p}^{-1}(x)$:\n$$ s_{p}(x) = \\exp_{p}(-(x - p)) = \\exp_{p}(p - x) $$\nUsing the formula for the exponential map with the vector $(p - x)$, we get:\n$$ s_{p}(x) = p + (p - x) = 2p - x $$\nThis result shows that in Euclidean space, the geodesic symmetry at $p$ is a point reflection through $p$. Geometrically, $p$ is the midpoint of the line segment connecting $x$ and $s_{p}(x)$, since $\\frac{1}{2}(x + s_{p}(x)) = \\frac{1}{2}(x + (2p - x)) = p$.\n\n### Part 2: The Unit Sphere $S^{n}$\n\nLet the manifold be the unit sphere $M = S^{n} = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\langle y, y \\rangle = 1\\}$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the standard Euclidean inner product in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The metric on $S^{n}$ is the round metric induced by the ambient space. For a point $p \\in S^{n}$, the tangent space is $T_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\langle v, p \\rangle = 0\\}$.\n\nGeodesics on $S^{n}$ are great circles, which are formed by intersecting the sphere with a $2$-dimensional plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. A geodesic $\\gamma_{v}(t)$ starting at $p \\in S^{n}$ with initial velocity $v \\in T_{p}S^{n}$ is found by considering the great circle in the plane spanned by the vectors $p$ and $v$.

Thus, $\\|v\\| = d(p,x) = \\arccos(\\langle p, x \\rangle)$. Let's denote this angle by $\\theta$.\nThe vector $v$ must lie in the plane spanned by $p$ and $x$ and must be orthogonal to $p$. The component of $x$ in the direction of $T_{p}S^{n}$ is given by the projection of $x$ onto the orthogonal complement of $p$:\n$$ x_{T} = x - \\langle x, p \\rangle p $$\nThis vector $x_{T}$ gives the direction of $v$. So, $v = c \\cdot x_{T}$ for some scalar $c > 0$.\nThe magnitude of $x_{T}$ is $\\|x_{T}\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x - \\langle x, p \\rangle p, x - \\langle x, p \\rangle p \\rangle} = \\sqrt{\\|x\\|^{2} - \\langle x,p \\rangle^{2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^{2}\\theta} = \\sin\\theta$, since $x$ is in a normal neighborhood of $p$ ($0 \\le \\theta  \\pi$, so $\\sin\\theta \\ge 0$).\nWe have $\\|v\\| = c \\|x_T\\|$, which means $\\theta = c \\sin\\theta$, so $c = \\frac{\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\nTherefore, the inverse exponential map is given by:\n$$ v = \\exp_{p}^{-1}(x) = \\frac{\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} (x - \\langle p, x \\rangle p) = \\frac{\\arccos(\\langle p, x \\rangle)}{\\sqrt{1-\\langle p,x \\rangle^{2}}} (x - \\langle p, x \\rangle p) $$\n\nNow we compute the geodesic symmetry $s_{p}(x) = \\exp_{p}(-v)$. We use the exponential map formula with the vector $-v$. Note that $\\|-v\\| = \\|v\\| = \\theta$.\n$$ s_{p}(x) = \\cos(\\|-v\\|)p + \\sin(\\|-v\\|)\\frac{-v}{\\|-v\\|} = \\cos(\\theta)p - \\sin(\\theta)\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|} $$\nWe have $\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|} = \\frac{x_T}{\\|x_T\\|} = \\frac{x - \\langle p, x \\rangle p}{\\sin\\theta}$. Substituting this into the expression for $s_{p}(x)$:\n$$ s_{p}(x) = \\cos(\\theta)p - \\sin(\\theta)\\left(\\frac{x - \\langle p, x \\rangle p}{\\sin\\theta}\\right) $$\n$$ s_{p}(x) = \\cos(\\theta)p - (x - \\langle p, x \\rangle p) $$\nSubstituting $\\cos\\theta = \\langle p, x \\rangle$:\n$$ s_{p}(x) = \\langle p, x \\rangle p - x + \\langle p, x \\rangle p $$\n$$ s_{p}(x) = 2\\langle p, x \\rangle p - x $$\nThis formula gives the geodesic symmetry on $S^{n}$ in terms of the ambient coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and the inner product.

We compute $2g(\\nabla_{X_{1}}Y_{1}, Z_{2})$.\n$g(Y_1,Z_2)=0$, $g(Z_2,X_1)=0$. $g(X_1,Y_1)=g_1(X_1,Y_1)$ is a function on $M_1$, so $Z_2(g_1(X_1,Y_1))=0$.\nThe Lie brackets $[X_1,Y_1]$ is type $1$, so $g([X_1,Y_1],Z_2)=0$. Also $[Y_1,Z_2]=0$ and $[Z_2,X_1]=0$. All terms on the right-hand side are zero.\nSo, $g(\\nabla_{X_1}Y_1,Z_2)=0$. This means $\\nabla_{X_1}Y_1$ has no type $2$ component.\nCombining these, we have $\\nabla_{X_{1}}Y_{1} = (\\nabla^{1}_{X_{1}}Y_{1}, 0)$.\n\nNext, let's compute $\\nabla_{X_{1}}Y_{2}$, where $X_1$ is type $1$ and $Y_2$ is type $2$. Let $Z$ be an arbitrary vector field, $Z = (Z_1, Z_2)$.\nFirst, consider $Z=Z_1$. $2g(\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2, Z_1) = X_1(g(Y_2,Z_1)) + Y_2(g(Z_1,X_1)) - Z_1(g(X_1,Y_2)) + \\dots$. All metric terms are $0$. All Lie bracket terms are $0$ (e.g. $[X_1, Y_2]=0$, $[Y_2, Z_1]=0$). So $g(\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2, Z_1)=0$.\nNext, consider $Z=Z_2$. $2g(\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2, Z_2) = X_1(g(Y_2,Z_2)) + \\dots$ . $g(Y_2,Z_2)=g_2(Y_2,Z_2)$ is a function on $M_2$, so $X_1(g_2(Y_2,Z_2))=0$. The other terms are also zero for similar reasons. So $g(\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2, Z_2)=0$.\nThis means $\\nabla_{X_{1}}Y_{2}$ is orthogonal to all vector fields, so it must be zero. $\\nabla_{X_{1}}Y_{2}=0$.\n\nBy symmetry between $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$:\n- $\\nabla_{X_{2}}Y_{2} = (0, \\nabla^{2}_{X_{2}}Y_{2})$\n- $\\nabla_{X_{2}}Y_{1} = 0$\n\nUsing the linearity of the connection $\\nabla$, for general vector fields $X = (X_1,X_2)$ and $Y = (Y_1,Y_2)$:\n$$ \\nabla_{X}Y = \\nabla_{(X_{1},X_{2})}(Y_{1},Y_{2}) = \\nabla_{X_{1}+X_{2}}(Y_{1}+Y_{2}) $$\n$$ = \\nabla_{X_{1}}Y_{1} + \\nabla_{X_{1}}Y_{2} + \\nabla_{X_{2}}Y_{1} + \\nabla_{X_{2}}Y_{2} $$\n$$ = (\\nabla^{1}_{X_{1}}Y_{1}, 0) + 0 + 0 + (0, \\nabla^{2}_{X_{2}}Y_{2}) $$\n$$ = (\\nabla^{1}_{X_{1}}Y_{1}, \\nabla^{2}_{X_{2}}Y_{2}) $$\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Riemann curvature tensor $R$**\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is defined as $R(U,V)W = \\nabla_{U}\\nabla_{V}W - \\nabla_{V}\\nabla_{U}W - \\nabla_{[U,V]}W$.\nLet $U=(U_1,U_2)$, $V=(V_1,V_2)$, and $W=(W_1,W_2)$.\nUsing our formula for $\\nabla$:\n$\\nabla_{V}W = (\\nabla^1_{V_1}W_1, \\nabla^2_{V_2}W_2)$.\n$\\nabla_{U}(\\nabla_{V}W) = \\nabla_{(U_1,U_2)}(\\nabla^1_{V_1}W_1, \\nabla^2_{V_2}W_2) = (\\nabla^1_{U_1}(\\nabla^1_{V_1}W_1), \\nabla^2_{U_2}(\\nabla^2_{V_2}W_2))$.\nThe Lie bracket is $[U,V] = [(U_1,U_2),(V_1,V_2)] = ([U_1,V_1], [U_2,V_2])$.\nSo, $\\nabla_{[U,V]}W = (\\nabla^1_{[U_1,V_1]}W_1, \\nabla^2_{[U_2,V_2]}W_2)$.\nThe first component of $R(U,V)W$ is:\n$$ (\\nabla^1_{U_1}\\nabla^1_{V_1}W_1 - \\nabla^1_{V_1}\\nabla^1_{U_1}W_1 - \\nabla^1_{[U_1,V_1]}W_1) = R^1(U_1,V_1)W_1 $$\nThe second component of $R(U,V)W$ is:\n$$ (\\nabla^2_{U_2}\\nabla^2_{V_2}W_2 - \\nabla^2_{V_2}\\nabla^2_{U_2}W_2 - \\nabla^2_{[U_2,V_2]}W_2) = R^2(U_2,V_2)W_2 $$\nThus, the curvature tensor of the product manifold is given by:\n$$ R((U_1,U_2), (V_1,V_2))(W_1,W_2) = (R^1(U_1,V_1)W_1, R^2(U_2,V_2)W_2) $$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$**\n\nWe are asked to compute the sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of the $2$-plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{U,V\\}$, where $U = (X,0)$ and $V = (0,Y)$ for nonzero $X \\in T_{p}M_{1}$ and $Y \\in T_{q}M_{2}$.\nThe formula for sectional curvature is:\n$$ K(\\sigma) = \\frac{g\\big(R(U,V)V,U\\big)}{g(U,U)\\,g(V,V) - g(U,V)^{2}} $$\nFirst, we compute the terms in the denominator:\n$g(U,U) = g((X,0), (X,0)) = g_1(X,X) + g_2(0,0) = g_1(X,X)$.\n$g(V,V) = g((0,Y), (0,Y)) = g_1(0,0) + g_2(Y,Y) = g_2(Y,Y)$.\n$g(U,V) = g((X,0), (0,Y)) = g_1(X,0) + g_2(0,Y) = 0$.\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are nonzero, $g_1(X,X)0$ and $g_2(Y,Y)0$. The denominator is $g_1(X,X)g_2(Y,Y)  0$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerator. We need to find $R(U,V)V$.\nHere, $U=(X,0)$, $V=(0,Y)$. So in our general formula for $R$, we have:\n$U_1=X, U_2=0$\n$V_1=0, V_2=Y$\nThe vector we are applying the operator to is $V$ itself, so $W_1=0, W_2=Y$.\nPlugging these into the formula for $R$:\n$R(U,V)V = R((X,0), (0,Y))(0,Y) = (R^1(X,0)0, R^2(0,Y)Y)$.\nThe Riemann tensor is linear in each argument. Therefore:\n$R^1(X,0)0 = 0$.\n$R^2(0,Y)Y = 0$.\nSo, $R(U,V)V = (0,0)$, which is the zero vector in $T_{(p,q)}M$.\n\nThe numerator is then:\n$g(R(U,V)V, U) = g(0, U) = 0$.\n\nFinally, the sectional curvature is:\n$$ K(\\sigma) = \\frac{0}{g_1(X,X)g_2(Y,Y)} = 0 $$\nThe sectional curvature of any mixed plane in a Riemannian product is zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3056851"}]}
