It is a well-posed problem in elementary Riemannian geometry, grounded in established scientific principles and expressed in clear, objective language. It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The task is to compute the holonomy of a specific loop in Euclidean space by explicitly solving the parallel transport equations from first principles, which is a standard and verifiable mathematical exercise.\n\nLet the manifold be $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the standard Euclidean metric $g$, which in global Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, x^2) = (x, y)$ has components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The Levi-Civita connection is characterized by the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$. These are defined by the formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, the metric components $g_{ij}$ are constants ($g_{11}=1$, $g_{22}=1$, $g_{12}=0$, $g_{21}=0$) across the entire manifold. Consequently, all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, l.\n$$\nTherefore, all Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection for the flat Euclidean metric are identically zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, k \\in \\{1, 2\\}.\n$$\nThis result is fundamental and reflects the \"flatness\" of the Euclidean space, meaning its geometry is non-curved. The Riemann curvature tensor, which is constructed from the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives, is identically zero.\n\nNext, we consider parallel transport of a vector field $V(t)$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$. Let the components of $V(t)$ in the standard basis $\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y\\}$ be $(V^1(t), V^2(t))$, so $V(t) = V^1(t)\\partial_x + V^2(t)\\partial_y$. The condition for parallel transport, $D_t V = 0$, where $D_t$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, is expressed in local coordinates as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{d V^k(t)}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{d\\gamma^i(t)}{dt} V^j(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2.\n$$\nHere, $(\\gamma^1(t), \\gamma^2(t))$ are the coordinate functions of the curve $\\gamma(t)$. Since we have established that $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all indices, the parallel transport equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$$\n\\frac{d V^k(t)}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2.\n$$\nThis ODE system implies that the components $V^1(t)$ and $V^2(t)$ of the vector $V(t)$ are constant with respect to the parameter $t$ along any smooth segment of the curve.\n\nThe problem requires us to solve for the parallel transport along the piecewise smooth loop $\\gamma(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=4$. Let the initial vector at $t=0$ be $v_0 = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$, so $V(0) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$. We analyze the transport along each of the four segments.\n\n1.  **Segment 1: $t \\in [0, 1]$**\n    The curve is $\\gamma(t) = (at, 0)$. The parallel transport equations are $\\frac{dV^1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dV^2}{dt} = 0$. The solution is $V^1(t) = C_1$ and $V^2(t) = C_2$.\n    Using the initial condition $V(0) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$, we find $C_1 = v_0^1$ and $C_2 = v_0^2$.\n    Thus, for $t \\in [0, 1]$, the vector field is constant: $V(t) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n    At the end of this segment, at $t=1$, the vector is $V(1) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n\n2.  **Segment 2: $t \\in [1, 2]$**\n    The curve is $\\gamma(t) = (a, a(t-1))$. The parallel transport equations remain $\\frac{dV^1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dV^2}{dt} = 0$. The solution is $V^1(t) = D_1$ and $V^2(t) = D_2$.\n    The initial condition for this segment is the value of the vector at the end of the previous segment, $V(1) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n    Applying this at $t=1$, we get $D_1 = v_0^1$ and $D_2 = v_0^2$.\n    Thus, for $t \\in [1, 2]$, the vector field is also constant: $V(t) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n    At the end of this segment, at $t=2$, the vector is $V(2) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n\n3.  **Segment 3: $t \\in [2, 3]$**\n    The curve is $\\gamma(t) = (a(3-t), a)$. The equations are the same, with solution $V^1(t) = E_1$ and $V^2(t) = E_2$.\n    The initial condition is $V(2) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$. This gives $E_1 = v_0^1$ and $E_2 = v_0^2$.\n    So, for $t \\in [2, 3]$, $V(t) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n    At the end of this segment, at $t=3$, the vector is $V(3) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n\n4.  **Segment 4: $t \\in [3, 4]$**\n    The curve is $\\gamma(t) = (0, a(4-t))$. The equations are the same, with solution $V^1(t) = F_1$ and $V^2(t) = F_2$.\n    The initial condition is $V(3) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$. This gives $F_1 = v_0^1$ and $F_2 = v_0^2$.\n    So, for $t \\in [3, 4]$, $V(t) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n    At the end of the loop, at $t=4$, the final vector is $V(4) = (v_0^1, v_0^2)$.\n\nThe parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ maps the initial vector $v_0$ at $\\gamma(0)$ to the final vector $V(4)$ at $\\gamma(4)$. Since $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(4) = (0,0)$, $P_{\\gamma}$ is a linear map from $T_{(0,0)}\\mathbb{R}^2$ to itself. We have found that:\n$$\nP_{\\gamma}(v_0) = V(4) = (v_0^1, v_0^2) = v_0.\n$$\nThe map $P_{\\gamma}$ is the identity map.

We will use the method of moving frames as specified.\n\nLet $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ be a local oriented orthonormal frame field defined on an open set containing the triangle $T$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a parameterization of the boundary $\\partial T$, starting and ending at $p$. Let $V(t)$ be the vector field along $\\gamma(t)$ obtained by the parallel transport of the initial vector $v = V(0)$. The condition for parallel transport is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)}V(t) = 0$.\n\nLet's express $V(t)$ in terms of the local frame: $V(t) = c_{1}(t)e_{1}(\\gamma(t)) + c_{2}(t)e_{2}(\\gamma(t))$. The covariant derivative is:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{1}}{\\mathrm{d}t}e_{1} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t}e_{2} \\right) + \\left( c_{1}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}e_{1} + c_{2}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}e_{2} \\right) $$\nThe covariant derivatives of the frame vectors are given by the connection $1$-form, $\\omega_{12}$. For an oriented frame, we have the definitions:\n$$ \\nabla_{X}e_{1} = \\omega_{12}(X)e_{2} $$\n$$ \\nabla_{X}e_{2} = -\\omega_{12}(X)e_{1} $$\nApplying this with $X = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, the condition $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V=0$ becomes:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{1}}{\\mathrm{d}t} - c_{2}\\,\\omega_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}) \\right)e_{1} + \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + c_{1}\\,\\omega_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}) \\right)e_{2} = 0 $$\nSince $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ is a basis, their coefficients must be zero, which gives us a system of ordinary differential equations for the components $c_{1}(t)$ and $c_{2}(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{1}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = c_{2}\\,\\omega_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -c_{1}\\,\\omega_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}) $$\nThis system describes a rotation. If we represent the component vector $(c_{1}(t), c_{2}(t))$ by its angle $\\phi(t)$ such that $c_1(t) = C\\cos(\\phi(t))$ and $c_2(t) = C\\sin(\\phi(t))$ for some constant magnitude $C = |v|$, then differentiating $c_1(t)$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{1}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -C\\sin(\\phi(t))\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -c_{2}(t)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nComparing this with the first ODE, we find:\n$$ -c_{2}(t)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}t} = c_{2}(t)\\,\\omega_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}) \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\omega_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t)) $$\nThe total change in the angle $\\phi$ of the components, as we traverse the entire loop $\\partial T$, is obtained by integrating $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ along the curve. This change in angle of the components of $V(t)$ relative to the frame $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ represents the rotation of the vector $V(t)$. The frame itself is single-valued, so $e_i$ at the end of the loop is the same as at the start. Therefore, the total signed angle of rotation of the vector $v$, which we will call $\\theta_{\\text{signed}}$, is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{signed}} = \\Delta\\phi = \\int_{\\partial T} -\\omega_{12}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\,\\mathrm{d}t = -\\int_{\\partial T} \\omega_{12} $$\nThis expression relates the holonomy rotation to the line integral of the connection $1$-form around the loop $\\partial T$.\n\nNext, we use the foundational facts provided. By Stokes' theorem, the line integral of a $1$-form over the boundary of a region is equal to the surface integral of its exterior derivative over the region itself:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial T} \\omega_{12} = \\int_{T} \\mathrm{d}\\omega_{12} $$\nFrom the first Cartan structure equation, the exterior derivative of the connection $1$-form is the curvature $2$-form, $\\Omega_{12}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}\\omega_{12} = \\Omega_{12} $$\nFrom the second Cartan structure equation for a surface, the curvature $2$-form is related to the Gauss curvature $K$ and the area form $\\mathrm{d}A$:\n$$ \\Omega_{12} = K\\,\\mathrm{d}A $$\nCombining these three facts, we can transform the line integral:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial T} \\omega_{12} = \\int_{T} \\mathrm{d}\\omega_{12} = \\int_{T} \\Omega_{12} = \\int_{T} K\\,\\mathrm{d}A $$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for the signed angle of rotation:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{signed}} = -\\int_{T} K\\,\\mathrm{d}A $$\nThe problem asks for $\\theta$, the magnitude of this rotation angle.\n$$ \\theta = |\\theta_{\\text{signed}}| = \\left| -\\int_{T} K\\,\\mathrm{d}A \\right| = \\left| \\int_{T} K\\,\\mathrm{d}A \\right| $$\nFor a general surface, if the triangle $T$ is small, we can approximate the integral by assuming $K$ is constant over $T$. Let $p_{0}$ be a point in $T$. Then, to first order in the area of $T$, denoted $A(T)$:\n$$ \\int_{T} K\\,\\mathrm{d}A \\approx K(p_{0}) \\int_{T} \\mathrm{d}A = K(p_{0})A(T) $$\nThus, the magnitude of the rotation angle is approximated by $\\theta \\approx |K(p_{0})|A(T)$. This fulfills the first part of the problem's request.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the 2-sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ of radius $R$. For this surface, the Gauss curvature $K$ is constant everywhere and is given by the well-known formula:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{R^2} $$\nSince $K$ is a positive constant, the first-order approximation becomes an exact equality for a region $T$ of any size. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{T} K\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{T} \\frac{1}{R^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\int_{T} \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{A(T)}{R^2} $$\nThe magnitude of the rotation angle $\\theta$ is therefore:\n$$ \\theta = \\left| \\frac{A(T)}{R^2} \\right| $$\nSince the area $A(T)$ and the radius $R$ are positive quantities, $A(T)>0$ and $R>0$, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{A(T)}{R^2} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the holonomy angle $\\theta$ in terms of the area of the region $T$ and the radius of the sphere $R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{A(T)}{R^{2}}}$$", "id": "3063097"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that local curvature generates holonomy for small, contractible loops.

The loop $\\gamma$ closes in $M$ because $\\tilde{p}_1$ and $\\tilde{p}_0$ are in the same orbit under the action of $\\langle \\varphi \\rangle$:\n$$ \\varphi(\\tilde{p}_0) = \\varphi(0,0) = (0+L, -0) = (L,0) = \\tilde{p}_1 $$\nThus, $\\pi(\\tilde{p}_1) = \\pi(\\varphi(\\tilde{p}_0)) = \\pi(\\tilde{p}_0) = p$.\n\nLet $v \\in T_p M$ be a tangent vector. We identify the tangent space $T_p M$ with the tangent space $T_{\\tilde{p}_0}S = T_{(0,0)}S$ via the differential of the projection, $(D\\pi)_{\\tilde{p}_0}$. Let $\\tilde{v}_0 \\in T_{(0,0)}S$ be the vector corresponding to $v$.\n\nTo find the parallel transport of $v$ along $\\gamma$, we parallel transport its lift $\\tilde{v}_0$ along the lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}$. The connection on $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the standard flat Euclidean connection. Parallel transport of a vector in Euclidean space simply means keeping its components constant with respect to the standard basis. So, the parallel transport of $\\tilde{v}_0$ from $\\tilde{p}_0=(0,0)$ to $\\tilde{p}_1=(L,0)$ along $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ results in a vector $\\tilde{v}_1 \\in T_{(L,0)}S$ which has the exact same components as $\\tilde{v}_0$.\n\nThe parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}: T_p M \\to T_p M$ is the transformation that maps the initial vector $v$ to the final vector. To compare the final vector with the initial one, we must map it back to the initial tangent space representation $T_{(0,0)}S$. The points $\\tilde{p}_0=(0,0)$ and $\\tilde{p}_1=(L,0)$ are related by the deck transformation $\\varphi$. The relationship between the tangent spaces $T_{\\tilde{p}_0}S$ and $T_{\\tilde{p}_1}S$ under the quotient identification is given by the differential of this transformation.\n\nThe relation $\\pi \\circ \\varphi = \\pi$ implies $(D\\pi)_{\\varphi(\\tilde{q})} \\circ (D\\varphi)_{\\tilde{q}} = (D\\pi)_{\\tilde{q}}$ for any $\\tilde{q} \\in S$. Let $\\tilde{w}_0 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_0}S$ and $\\tilde{w}_1 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_1}S$ be two vectors that represent the *same* vector in $T_p M$. This means $(D\\pi)_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{w}_0) = (D\\pi)_{\\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{w}_1)$. Substituting $\\tilde{p}_1 = \\varphi(\\tilde{p}_0)$ and the chain rule identity, we get $(D\\pi)_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{w}_0) = (D\\pi)_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\circ (D\\varphi)_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{w}_1)$. Since $(D\\pi)_{\\tilde{p}_0}$ is an isomorphism, this implies $\\tilde{w}_0 = (D\\varphi)_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{w}_1)$.\n\nIn our parallel transport process, we started with $\\tilde{v}_0 \\in T_{(0,0)}S$ and ended with $\\tilde{v}_1 \\in T_{(L,0)}S$, where $\\tilde{v}_1$ and $\\tilde{v}_0$ have identical components. Let the final vector, expressed back in the representation space $T_{(0,0)}S$, be $\\tilde{v}_f$. Then $\\tilde{v}_f$ and $\\tilde{v}_1$ must represent the same vector in $T_pM$. Using the rule we just derived, $\\tilde{v}_f = (D\\varphi)_{(0,0)}(\\tilde{v}_1)$. Since $\\tilde{v}_1=\\tilde{v}_0$ as vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we have:\n$$ P_{\\gamma}(\\tilde{v}_0) = \\tilde{v}_f = (D\\varphi)_{(0,0)}(\\tilde{v}_0) $$\nThe parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ is therefore the linear transformation given by the differential of $\\varphi$ at $(0,0)$.\n\nThe map is $\\varphi(x,y) = (x+L, -y)$. Its Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ D\\varphi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x+L) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x+L) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-y) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-y) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix is constant for all points in $S$. Thus, the parallel transport map along $\\gamma$ is given by this matrix:\n$$ P_{\\gamma} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis transformation is a reflection across the $x$-axis in the tangent space.\n\n**2. Identification of the restricted holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}$**\n\nThe restricted holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}$ is, by definition, the subgroup of the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}$ generated by parallel transport along all loops that are contractible in $M$. It is also the identity component of the Lie group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}$.\n\nThe Ambrose-Singer Holonomy Theorem states that the Lie algebra of $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}$ is generated by the curvature operators $R(X,Y): T_p M \\to T_p M$ for all $X, Y \\in T_p M$.\nThe manifold $M$ is flat, meaning its Riemann curvature tensor is zero everywhere. This is because $M$ is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is flat.\nSince the curvature tensor is zero, all curvature operators are zero: $R(X,Y)=0$ for all $X, Y \\in T_p M$.\nThis implies that the Lie algebra of $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}$ is the zero algebra. The only connected Lie group with a zero Lie algebra is the trivial group containing only the identity element.\nTherefore, the restricted holonomy group is the trivial group:\n$$ \\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0} = \\{\\text{Id}\\} $$\nwhere $\\text{Id}$ is the identity transformation on $T_p M$.\n\n**3. Holonomy group and the index $[\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}:\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}]$**\n\nThe full holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}$ consists of all transformations obtained from parallel transport along *any* loop based at $p$. The set of such transformations forms a group. This group is generated by the parallel transport maps corresponding to a set of generating loops for the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M,p)$.\n\nThe manifold $M$ is a Möbius band. The fundamental group of the Möbius band is the infinite cyclic group, $\\pi_1(M,p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The loop $\\gamma$, which corresponds to traversing the central circle of the band once, is a generator for this group.\nAny loop in $M$ based at $p$ is homotopic to $\\gamma^k$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The holonomy map for such a loop is $(P_{\\gamma})^k$.\nTherefore, the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}$ is the cyclic group generated by the transformation $P_{\\gamma}$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Hol}_{p} = \\langle P_{\\gamma} \\rangle $$\nLet's compute the powers of $P_{\\gamma}$:\n$$ P_{\\gamma} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ (P_{\\gamma})^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\text{Id} $$\nThe group is $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p} = \\{\\text{Id}, P_{\\gamma}\\}$. This is a group of order $2$, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nSince $P_{\\gamma} \\neq \\text{Id}$, the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}$ is non-trivial. It is a discrete group with two elements, so it is disconnected. The identity component is $\\{\\text{Id}\\}$, which confirms our finding for $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}$.\n\nThe index $[\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}:\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}]$ is the number of left (or right) cosets of $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}$ in $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}$. By Lagrange's theorem for finite groups, this is given by the ratio of the orders of the groups:\n$$ [\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}:\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}] = \\frac{|\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}|}{|\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}|} $$\nWe have $|\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}| = 2$ and $|\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}| = 1$.\n$$ [\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}:\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^{0}] = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 $$\nThe index is $2$. This value also represents the number of connected components of the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3063111"}]}
