The second part asks for an application of these results to a specific isometry on $\\mathbb{R}^{6}$.\n\n**Part 1: General Theory**\n\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a Euclidean isometry given by $f(x) = Ax + b$, where $A \\in O(n)$ is an orthogonal matrix and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The fixed point set of $f$ is denoted by $\\operatorname{Fix}(f)$. By definition, a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a fixed point of $f$ if and only if $f(x) = x$. We can write this condition as an equation for $x$:\n$$\nAx + b = x\n$$\nRearranging this equation, we obtain a linear system:\n$$\nx - Ax = b\n$$\n$$\n(I - A)x = b\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. Let $T = I - A$. The fixed point set $\\operatorname{Fix}(f)$ is precisely the set of solutions to the linear system $Tx = b$.\n\n**1. Condition for a Non-empty Fixed Point Set**\nThe fixed point set $\\operatorname{Fix}(f)$ is non-empty if and only if the equation $Tx=b$ has at least one solution. A solution exists if and only if the vector $b$ belongs to the image (or column space) of the linear map $T = I - A$. That is, $\\operatorname{Fix}(f) \\neq \\varnothing$ if and only if $b \\in \\operatorname{Im}(I-A)$.\n\nFor a linear operator $T$ on a finite-dimensional real inner product space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle)$, the image of $T$ is the orthogonal complement of the kernel of its adjoint, $T^T$. This is a consequence of the Fredholm alternative, summarized by the relation $\\operatorname{Im}(T) = (\\ker(T^T))^\\perp$. The adjoint of the matrix $T = I-A$ with respect to the standard dot product is its transpose, $T^T = (I-A)^T = I^T - A^T = I - A^T$.\n\nTherefore, the condition $b \\in \\operatorname{Im}(I-A)$ is equivalent to $b$ being orthogonal to every vector in $\\ker(I - A^T)$.\nNow, we use the fact that $A$ is an orthogonal matrix, which means $A^T A = I$, or $A^T = A^{-1}$. Substituting this into the kernel condition, we get:\n$$\n\\ker(I - A^T) = \\ker(I - A^{-1})\n$$\nLet's analyze the space $\\ker(I - A^{-1})$. A vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is in this kernel if and only if $(I - A^{-1})v = 0$. This is equivalent to $v = A^{-1}v$. Since $A$ is invertible, we can multiply by $A$ on the left, which gives $Av = A(A^{-1}v) = Iv = v$. The condition $Av = v$ is the definition of $v$ being an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $1$. The set of all such vectors is the $1$-eigenspace of $A$, denoted $E_{1}(A)$, which is precisely $\\ker(I-A)$.\nConversely, if $v \\in E_1(A)$, then $Av=v$. Multiplying by $A^{-1}$ gives $v=A^{-1}v$, so $v \\in \\ker(I-A^{-1})$.\nThus, we have shown that $\\ker(I - A^T) = E_{1}(A)$.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for $\\operatorname{Fix}(f)$ to be non-empty is that $b$ is orthogonal to $\\ker(I-A^T) = E_1(A)$. Formally, this condition is $b \\in (E_{1}(A))^{\\perp}$.\n\n**2. Characterization and Dimension of the Fixed Point Set**\nWhen the condition $b \\in (E_{1}(A))^{\\perp}$ is met, the linear system $(I-A)x = b$ has at least one solution. Let $x_0$ be any particular solution. The general solution to an inhomogeneous linear system is the sum of a particular solution and the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous system, which is $(I-A)x = 0$. The solution space of the homogeneous system is, by definition, the kernel of $I-A$, which is $E_1(A)$.\n\nTherefore, the fixed point set is given by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Fix}(f) = \\{ x_0 + v \\mid v \\in E_1(A) \\} = x_0 + E_1(A)\n$$\nThis describes an affine subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. It is the vector subspace $E_1(A)$ translated by the vector $x_0$.\nThe dimension of an affine subspace is defined as the dimension of its associated vector subspace. In this case, the associated vector subspace is $E_1(A)$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the fixed point set is:\n$$\n\\dim \\operatorname{Fix}(f) = \\dim E_1(A)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Application to a Specific Isometry**\n\nWe are given an isometry on $\\mathbb{R}^{6}$ with the matrix $A = \\operatorname{diag}\\!\\big(1,\\,1,\\,R_{\\pi},\\,R_{\\pi/3}\\big)$ and the vector $b = (0, 0, 1, -2, 3, 0)^T$.\nThe matrix $R_{\\theta}$ is given by $\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\theta&-\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta&\\cos\\theta\\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $\\theta=\\pi$, $R_{\\pi} = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix} = -I_2$.\nFor $\\theta=\\pi/3$, $R_{\\pi/3} = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 & -\\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\ \\sqrt{3}/2 & 1/2\\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe full matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 & -\\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{3}/2 & 1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAccording to the result from Part 1, the dimension of the fixed point set is $\\dim E_1(A)$, provided the set is non-empty. To find $\\dim E_1(A)$, we must find the dimension of the kernel of $T = I-A$.\n$$\nI-A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1-(-1) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1-(-1) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1-1/2 & -(-\\sqrt{3}/2) \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -(\\sqrt{3}/2) & 1-1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 & \\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\sqrt{3}/2 & 1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need to find the kernel of this matrix by solving $(I-A)x=0$ for $x=(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6)^T$.\nThe system of equations is:\n1. $0 \\cdot x_1 = 0$\n2. $0 \\cdot x_2 = 0$\n3. $2x_3 = 0 \\implies x_3 = 0$\n4. $2x_4 = 0 \\implies x_4 = 0$\n5. $\\frac{1}{2}x_5 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x_6 = 0$\n6. $-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x_5 + \\frac{1}{2}x_6 = 0$\n\nThe first two equations place no constraints on $x_1$ and $x_2$. For the last two equations, the determinant of the corresponding $2 \\times 2$ matrix is $(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) - (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 \\neq 0$. Since the matrix is invertible, the only solution to this subsystem is $x_5=0$ and $x_6=0$.\nSo, a vector $x$ is in $\\ker(I-A)$ if and only if $x_3=x_4=x_5=x_6=0$. The components $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be any real numbers.\nThis means the kernel is spanned by the vectors $e_1 = (1,0,0,0,0,0)^T$ and $e_2 = (0,1,0,0,0,0)^T$.\n$$\nE_1(A) = \\ker(I-A) = \\operatorname{span}\\{e_1, e_2\\}\n$$\nThe dimension of this subspace is $\\dim E_1(A) = 2$.\n\nBefore concluding that $\\dim \\operatorname{Fix}(f)=2$, we must verify that the fixed point set is non-empty by checking if $b \\in (E_1(A))^{\\perp}$.\nThe vector $b$ is given as $b=(0, 0, 1, -2, 3, 0)^T$.\nWe check if $b$ is orthogonal to the basis vectors of $E_1(A)$:\n$$\n\\langle b, e_1 \\rangle = (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) + (-2)(0) + (3)(0) + (0)(0) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle b, e_2 \\rangle = (0)(0) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) + (-2)(0) + (3)(0) + (0)(0) = 0\n$$\nSince $b$ is orthogonal to all basis vectors of $E_1(A)$, it is orthogonal to the entire subspace, i.e., $b \\in (E_1(A))^\\perp$.\nThe condition for a non-empty fixed point set is satisfied. Therefore, we can conclude that the dimension of the fixed point set is equal to the dimension of the $1$-eigenspace of $A$.\n$$\n\\dim\\operatorname{Fix}(f) = \\dim E_1(A) = 2\n$$\nThe dimension of the fixed point set of the given isometry is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3054243"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the flat case, we now venture into the world of curved manifolds with the quintessential example: the sphere $S^2$.

We must proceed from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we express the map $R$ in the given spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$. The standard parametrization of the sphere $S^2$ of radius $1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by:\n$x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi$\n$y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi$\n$z = \\cos\\theta$\nwhere $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$ is the colatitude and $\\phi \\in (0, 2\\pi)$ is the longitude.\n\nThe map $R$ is defined as the reflection across the equatorial plane, $R(x,y,z) = (x,y,-z)$. Let a point $p \\in S^2$ have coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, and its image $R(p)$ have coordinates $(\\theta', \\phi')$. The coordinates of $R(p)$ must satisfy:\n$x' = \\sin\\theta' \\cos\\phi' = x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi$\n$y' = \\sin\\theta' \\sin\\phi' = y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi$\n$z' = \\cos\\theta' = -z = -\\cos\\theta$\n\nFrom the first two equations, by dividing them (for $x \\neq 0$), we get $\\tan\\phi' = \\tan\\phi$. As $\\sin\\theta' \\ge 0$ (since $\\theta' \\in [0,\\pi]$) and $\\sin\\theta > 0$ (since $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$), we must have $\\text{sgn}(\\cos\\phi') = \\text{sgn}(\\cos\\phi)$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sin\\phi') = \\text{sgn}(\\sin\\phi)$. This implies that $\\phi' = \\phi$.\nFrom the third equation, we have $\\cos\\theta' = -\\cos\\theta$. Since $\\cos(\\pi - u) = -\\cos u$, and both $\\theta$ and $\\theta'$ lie in the interval $(0, \\pi)$, this uniquely determines $\\theta' = \\pi - \\theta$.\nThus, in spherical coordinates, the map $R$ is given by:\n$R(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi - \\theta, \\phi)$.\n\nThe map $R$ as a linear transformation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is smooth. Its restriction to the submanifold $S^2$ is also smooth. Since $R \\circ R = \\text{Id}_{S^2}$, $R$ is its own inverse, and is therefore a bijection. Consequently, $R$ is a diffeomorphism of $S^2$ onto itself.\n\n**1. Justification that $R$ is an isometry and reverses orientation**\n\nAn isometry is a diffeomorphism that preserves the Riemannian metric. We must show that the pullback of the metric $g$ under $R$, denoted $R^*g$, is equal to $g$.\nThe metric $g$ is given by the line element $ds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta}d\\theta^2 + g_{\\phi\\phi}d\\phi^2 = d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\phi^2$.\nTo compute the pullback $R^*g$, we express the metric form at the image point $(\\theta', \\phi')$ and substitute the expressions for $\\theta'$ and $\\phi'$ in terms of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. Let the metric at a general point be written in terms of coordinates $(u,v)$ as $du^2 + \\sin^2 u \\, dv^2$. At the point $(\\theta', \\phi') = R(\\theta, \\phi)$, the metric form is $d\\theta'^2+\\sin^2\\theta'\\,d\\phi'^2$.\nThe pullback $R^*g$ is obtained by substituting the relations for the transformed coordinates:\n$\\theta' = \\pi - \\theta \\implies d\\theta' = d(\\pi - \\theta) = -d\\theta$\n$\\phi' = \\phi \\implies d\\phi' = d\\phi$\nWe also have $\\sin\\theta' = \\sin(\\pi - \\theta) = \\sin\\theta$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the metric form gives:\n$R^*g = (d\\theta')^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta') (d\\phi')^2 = (-d\\theta)^2 + (\\sin\\theta)^2 (d\\phi)^2 = d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\phi^2 = g$.\nSince $R^*g = g$, the map $R$ is an isometry of $(S^2, g)$.\n\nNext, we must justify that $R$ reverses orientation. The orientation is given by the ordered coordinate coframe $(d\\theta, d\\phi)$. An orientation-reversing map induces a change of basis on the cotangent space with a negative determinant. We can also check this using the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation $R(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\theta', \\phi') = (\\pi-\\theta, \\phi)$.\nThe Jacobian matrix of this transformation is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial\\theta'}{\\partial\\theta} & \\frac{\\partial\\theta'}{\\partial\\phi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\phi'}{\\partial\\theta} & \\frac{\\partial\\phi'}{\\partial\\phi} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is $\\det(J) = (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1$.\nSince $\\det(J) < 0$, the map $R$ reverses the orientation of $S^2$.\n\n**2. Computation of the pullback $R^*\\omega$**\n\nThe Riemannian area form is given as $\\omega = \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\wedge d\\phi$. We need to compute its pullback $R^*\\omega$. The pullback of a differential form is calculated by substituting the coordinate expressions and their differentials under the map.\nA differential $k$-form $\\alpha$ can be written in local coordinates $y^i$ as $\\alpha = f(y) dy^{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dy^{i_k}$. For a map $F: x \\mapsto y$, the pullback is $F^*\\alpha = (f \\circ F)(x) d(y^{i_1} \\circ F) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge d(y^{i_k} \\circ F)$.\n\nIn our case, the form $\\omega$ is expressed in coordinates $(\\theta', \\phi')$ on the target as $\\omega = \\sin\\theta' \\, d\\theta' \\wedge d\\phi'$.

Since $v \\in T_pS^n$, we have $\\langle v, p \\rangle = 0$.\n$$\\langle (\\nabla_u X_A)(p), v \\rangle = \\langle Au - \\langle Au, p \\rangle p, v \\rangle = \\langle Au, v \\rangle - \\langle Au, p \\rangle \\langle p, v \\rangle = \\langle Au, v \\rangle - \\langle Au, p \\rangle(0) = \\langle Au, v \\rangle$$\nBy interchanging the roles of $u$ and $v$, the second term in the Killing equation is:\n$$\\langle (\\nabla_v X_A)(p), u \\rangle = \\langle Av, u \\rangle$$\nSumming the two terms, the left-hand side of the Killing equation becomes:\n$$\\langle Au, v \\rangle + \\langle Av, u \\rangle$$\nUsing the property of the inner product that $\\langle M x, y \\rangle = \\langle x, M^T y \\rangle$ for any matrix $M$, we can rewrite the second term:\n$$\\langle Av, u \\rangle = \\langle v, A^T u \\rangle$$\nSince $A$ is skew-symmetric, $A^T = -A$. Therefore:\n$$\\langle Av, u \\rangle = \\langle v, -Au \\rangle = -\\langle v, Au \\rangle$$\nBy the symmetry of the inner product, $\\langle v, Au \\rangle = \\langle Au, v \\rangle$. Thus, the second term is $-\\langle Au, v \\rangle$.\nSubstituting this back into the sum, we get:\n$$\\langle Au, v \\rangle + (-\\langle Au, v \\rangle) = 0$$\nThis completes the verification of the Killing equation for any $u,v \\in T_pS^n$. The vector field $X_A(p)=Ap$ is indeed a Killing vector field for any $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(n+1)$. The question asks for the coordinate-free expression for $X_A(p)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Ap}$$", "id": "3054281"}]}
