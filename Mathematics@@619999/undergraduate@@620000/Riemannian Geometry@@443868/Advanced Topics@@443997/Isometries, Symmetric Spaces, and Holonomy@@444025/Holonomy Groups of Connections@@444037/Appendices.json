We will follow the structured tasks provided in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Christoffel symbols and parallel transport in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be endowed with the standard Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$. In standard Cartesian coordinates $\\{x^{1}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n}\\}$, the components of the metric tensor are given by the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. These components are constant throughout $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

Since the components $g_{j\\ell}$, $g_{i\\ell}$, and $g_{ij}$ are all constant ($\\delta_{j\\ell}$, $\\delta_{i\\ell}$, and $\\delta_{ij}$ respectively), their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate $x^{i}$ are zero.\n$$\n\\partial_{i} g_{j\\ell} = \\partial_{i} \\delta_{j\\ell} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols yields:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{\\; ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{k\\ell}\\left( 0 + 0 - 0 \\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, all Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection for the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are zero in standard Cartesian coordinates.\n\nNow, consider a vector field $V(t)$ along an arbitrary smooth curve $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

A vector $V_0 = V(0) \\in T_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}(0)}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is mapped to $V_1 = V(1) \\in T_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In the standard basis, if $V_0$ has components $(V^{1}(0), \\dots, V^{n}(0))$, then the transported vector $V_1$ has components $(V^{1}(1), \\dots, V^{n}(1))$.\nFrom our result, $V^{k}(1) = V^{k}(0)$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe standard basis for the tangent space $T_x \\mathbb{R}^n$ at any point $x$ can be identified with a single basis for the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Under this canonical identification, the vector $V_1$ is identical to the vector $V_0$. Therefore, the parallel transport map $P_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}$ is the identity map. If represented as a matrix in the standard basis, it is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix $I_{n}$.\n\nTask 3: Parallel transport on the torus $T^{n}$.\n\nThe $n$-torus $T^{n}$ is defined as the quotient manifold $T^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. The map $\\pi : \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to T^{n}$ given by $\\pi(x) = x \\bmod \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is a covering map. Since the metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ on $T^n$ is induced from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\pi$ is a local isometry. This implies that $\\pi$ preserves the Levi-Civita connection.\n\nLet $\\gamma : [0,1] \\to T^{n}$ be a piecewise smooth loop based at $p \\in T^n$, so $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = p$. Let $v \\in T_{p}T^{n}$ be a tangent vector. The parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ maps $v$ to $P_{\\gamma}(v) \\in T_{p}T^{n}$. To compute this, we lift the problem to the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nChoose a point $\\tilde{p}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\pi(\\tilde{p}_0) = p$. By the path lifting property of covering spaces, there exists a unique path $\\widetilde{\\gamma} : [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ starting at $\\tilde{p}_0$ such that $\\pi \\circ \\widetilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$. Since $\\gamma$ is a loop, its endpoint $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)$ must also lie in the fiber over $p$, i.e., $\\pi(\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)) = p$. This means there exists an integer vector $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ such that $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1) = \\tilde{p}_0 + m$. Let $\\tilde{p}_1 = \\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)$. The map $T_m : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by $T_m(x) = x+m$ is a deck transformation of the covering.\n\nThe computation of $P_{\\gamma}(v)$ proceeds in three steps:\n1. Lift the vector $v \\in T_p T^n$ to a vector $\\tilde{v}_0 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\mathbb{R}^n$. The differential $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0} : T_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T_p T^n$ is an isomorphism, so there is a unique $\\tilde{v}_0$ such that $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0) = v$.\n2. Parallel transport $\\tilde{v}_0$ along the lifted path $\\widetilde{\\gamma}$ to obtain a vector $\\tilde{v}_1 = P_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}(\\tilde{v}_0) \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_1} \\mathbb{R}^n$. As established in Task 2, under the standard identification of tangent spaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this map is the identity: the components of $\\tilde{v}_1$ in the standard basis at $\\tilde{p}_1$ are identical to the components of $\\tilde{v}_0$ in the standard basis at $\\tilde{p}_0$.\n3. Project the resulting vector $\\tilde{v}_1$ back down to $T_p T^n$. The transported vector is $P_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1)$.\n\nTo express $P_{\\gamma}$ as a linear map on $T_p T^n$, we need to relate the final vector $P_{\\gamma}(v)$ to the initial vector $v$. We have $v = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$. Thus, we need to compare $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1)$ with $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$.\n\nWe use the property that $\\pi$ commutes with deck transformations: $\\pi \\circ T_{-m} = \\pi$. Differentiating this identity at the point $\\tilde{p}_1$ gives:\n$d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1-m} \\circ dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}$.\nSince $\\tilde{p}_1 - m = \\tilde{p}_0$, this becomes $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\circ dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $P_{\\gamma}(v)$:\n$P_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1) = (d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\circ dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1})(\\tilde{v}_1) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1))$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the vector $dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1) \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nThe map $T_{-m}$ is a translation, so its differential $dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}$ maps a vector from $T_{\\tilde{p}_1}\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$ by preserving its components in the standard basis.\nFrom step 2, the vector $\\tilde{v}_1 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_1}\\mathbb{R}^n$ has the same components as $\\tilde{v}_0 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nTherefore, the vector $dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1)$ has the same components as $\\tilde{v}_0$. Since it is a vector in the same tangent space $T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$, it must be the same vector:\n$dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1) = \\tilde{v}_0$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P_{\\gamma}(v)$:\n$P_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$.\nBy the definition of the lift $\\tilde{v}_0$, we have $v = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$.\nTherefore, we conclude that $P_{\\gamma}(v) = v$ for any $v \\in T_p T^n$.\n\nThe parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ along any loop $\\gamma$ on the flat torus is the identity map on the tangent space $T_p T^n$. This signifies that the holonomy group of a flat torus is trivial.\n\nThe matrix representation of this linear map, with respect to any basis of $T_p T^n$ (in particular, the standard basis induced by the Cartesian basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ via $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}$), is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, which we denote by $I_n$.\nThe expression for the holonomy matrix is therefore $I_n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{I_{n}}\n$$", "id": "3049794"}, {"introduction": "Having established our baseline in a flat world, we now venture into a curved one.

This net rotation is the holonomy of the connection along the loop.\n\nThe problem statement directs us to use the foundational principle that a vector's rotation after parallel transport along a closed loop is determined by the total curvature of the region enclosed by that loop. For a region $D$ on a $2$-manifold bounded by a piecewise geodesic curve $\\gamma$, the angle of rotation, $\\Delta\\alpha$, is given by the Ambrose-Singer holonomy theorem, which in this context simplifies to the integral of the Gaussian curvature $K$ over the region $D$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\alpha = \\iint_D K \\, dA\n$$\nThis result is intimately related to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

This is a consequence of the Ambrose-Singer theorem or, more simply, a non-abelian version of Stokes' theorem which simplifies in this abelian case:\n$$ \\Theta = \\int_{\\Delta} \\Omega $$\nSubstituting the relation $\\Omega = K dA$, we get:\n$$ \\Theta = \\int_{\\Delta} K dA $$\nTo calculate this integral for the given geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ on $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$, we first need the Gaussian curvature $K$ of $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$. The metric is given as $g = y^{-2}(dx^{2} + dy^{2})$. This is a conformal metric of the form $g = \\lambda(x, y)(dx^{2} + dy^{2})$, with $\\lambda = y^{-2}$. The Gaussian curvature for such a metric is given by the formula:\n$$ K = -\\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial y^{2}} \\right) \\ln(\\lambda) $$\nHere, $\\lambda(y) = y^{-2}$, so $\\ln(\\lambda) = \\ln(y^{-2}) = -2\\ln(y)$. The Laplacian of $\\ln(\\lambda)$ is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial y^{2}} \\right) (-2\\ln(y)) = 0 + \\frac{d^{2}}{dy^{2}}(-2\\ln(y)) = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(-\\frac{2}{y}\\right) = \\frac{2}{y^{2}} $$\nSubstituting this into the formula for $K$:\n$$ K = -\\frac{1}{2(y^{-2})} \\left( \\frac{2}{y^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{y^{2}}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{y^{2}} \\right) = -1 $$\nThe hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ is a surface of constant Gaussian curvature $K = -1$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the integral for the rotation angle $\\Theta$.\n$$ \\Theta = \\int_{\\Delta} (-1) dA = -\\mathrm{Area}(\\Delta) $$\nThe area of a geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ on a surface of constant Gaussian curvature $K$ is given by the formula from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The theorem, in its local form for a region $D$ with piecewise smooth boundary $\\partial D$, states:\n$$ \\int_{D} K dA + \\int_{\\partial D} k_{g} ds + \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} = 2\\pi\\chi(D) $$\nwhere $k_{g}$ is the geodesic curvature of the boundary, $\\epsilon_{i}$ are the exterior angles at the vertices of the boundary, and $\\chi(D)$ is the Euler characteristic of the region.\n\nFor our geodesic triangle $\\Delta$, the boundary $c = \\partial\\Delta$ is composed of three geodesic segments. By definition, geodesics have zero geodesic curvature, so $k_{g} = 0$ along the sides of $\\Delta$. The region $\\Delta$ is topologically a disk, so its Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Delta) = 1$. The vertices have interior angles $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$. The corresponding exterior angles (the turning angles for a path traversing the boundary counter-clockwise) are $\\epsilon_{1} = \\pi - \\alpha$, $\\epsilon_{2} = \\pi - \\beta$, and $\\epsilon_{3} = \\pi - \\gamma$.\nApplying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Delta} K dA + 0 + (\\pi - \\alpha) + (\\pi - \\beta) + (\\pi - \\gamma) = 2\\pi(1) $$\n$$ \\int_{\\Delta} K dA + 3\\pi - (\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma) = 2\\pi $$\nSolving for the curvature integral:\n$$ \\int_{\\Delta} K dA = 2\\pi - 3\\pi + (\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma) = \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma - \\pi $$\nThis quantity is negative, as the sum of interior angles of a hyperbolic triangle is always less than $\\pi$. This corresponds to the fact that the area of the triangle is positive and $K=-1$. The area of the hyperbolic triangle is $\\mathrm{Area}(\\Delta) = \\pi - (\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma)$.\n\nFinally, we equate this result with our expression for the holonomy angle $\\Theta$:\n$$ \\Theta = \\int_{\\Delta} K dA = \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma - \\pi $$\nThis is the net rotation angle experienced by a vector upon parallel transport around the geodesic triangle $\\Delta$. The negative value signifies a clockwise rotation, which is characteristic of spaces with negative curvature.\n\nAs a supplementary note to address the full scope of the initial problem description, we can explain why the holonomy group of $\\nabla$ on $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ is $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$. The holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(\\nabla)$ at a point $p$ is the group of transformations of $T_{p}\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ generated by parallel transport along all possible closed loops based at $p$. Since parallel transport preserves the metric, $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(\\nabla)$ is a subgroup of the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(2)$. Since we consider oriented frames and $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ is connected, it must be a connected subgroup of the special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$. The corresponding Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(\\nabla)$, is a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$. The Ambrose-Singer theorem states that $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(\\nabla)$ is generated by the curvature operators $R(X, Y)$ for all $X, Y \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{H}^{2}$. Since the Gaussian curvature $K = -1 \\neq 0$, the curvature tensor is non-zero. For a $2$-manifold, a non-zero curvature tensor implies that the Lie algebra of holonomy is non-trivial. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is $1$-dimensional. Since $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(\\nabla)$ is a non-zero subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$, it must be equal to $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$. Because $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ is simply connected, its holonomy group is connected. The connected Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$. Therefore, the holonomy group is the entire group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma - \\pi}$$", "id": "3049833"}]}
