A Riemannian symmetric space is a connected Riemannian manifold $M$ such that for every point $p \\in M$ there exists an isometry $s_{p}$ with $s_{p}(p) = p$ and $(ds_p)_p = -\\mathrm{Id}$. Equivalently, a Riemannian symmetric space can be realized as a homogeneous space $G/K$ where $G$ is a Lie group, $K$ is a closed subgroup, and there exists an involutive automorphism of $G$ whose fixed-point subgroup contains $K$ as an open subgroup.\n\nUsing the realization of Grassmannians as Riemannian symmetric spaces via appropriate symmetric pairs $(G,K)$, determine the real dimensions $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n})$ by identifying suitable compact Lie groups $G$ and closed subgroups $K$ with transitive actions and computing the dimension of $G/K$ from the dimensions of $G$ and $K$.

The dimension of such a space is given by the formula $\\dim(G/K) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(K)$. We will treat the real and complex cases separately.\n\nFirst, we consider the real Grassmannian, $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, which is the space of all $k$-dimensional linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The orthogonal group $G = O(n)$ acts transitively on $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$. An element $g \\in O(n)$ is an isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, so it maps any $k$-dimensional subspace to another $k$-dimensional subspace. For any two $k$-dimensional subspaces $V_1$ and $V_2$, there exists an orthogonal transformation that maps an orthonormal basis of $V_1$ to an orthonormal basis of $V_2$. This transformation can be extended to an element of $O(n)$, demonstrating the transitivity of the action.\n\nTo express $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ as a homogeneous space, we identify the stabilizer subgroup $K$ of a specific point. Let us choose the reference subspace to be $P_0 = \\mathrm{span}\\{e_1, \\dots, e_k\\}$, where $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ is the standard orthonormal basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The stabilizer subgroup $K$ consists of all transformations $g \\in O(n)$ such that $g(P_0) = P_0$. An orthogonal transformation that preserves $P_0$ must also preserve its orthogonal complement $P_0^{\\perp} = \\mathrm{span}\\{e_{k+1}, \\dots, e_n\\}$. Consequently, such transformations have a block-diagonal matrix representation with respect to the basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$:\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} A & 0 \\\\ 0 & B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a $k \\times k$ orthogonal matrix and $B$ is an $(n-k) \\times (n-k)$ orthogonal matrix. Thus, the stabilizer subgroup $K$ is isomorphic to the direct product $O(k) \\times O(n-k)$.\nThis gives the identification $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n}) \\cong O(n)/(O(k) \\times O(n-k))$.\n\nThe dimension of a Lie group is the dimension of its Lie algebra. The Lie algebra of $O(m)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{o}(m)$, consists of all $m \\times m$ real skew-symmetric matrices. The number of independent entries in such a matrix is the number of entries above the main diagonal, which is $\\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$. Therefore, $\\dim O(m) = \\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$.\n\nWe can now compute the dimension of the real Grassmannian:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\dim O(n) - \\dim(O(k) \\times O(n-k))\n$$\n$$\n= \\dim O(n) - (\\dim O(k) + \\dim O(n-k))\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - \\left( \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the terms, we get:\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} [ (n^2 - n) - (k^2 - k) - ((n-k)^2 - (n-k)) ]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} [ (n^2 - n) - (k^2 - k) - (n^2 - 2nk + k^2 - n + k) ]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} [ n^2 - n - k^2 + k - n^2 + 2nk - k^2 + n - k ]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} [ 2nk - 2k^2 ] = k(n-k)\n$$\nSo, the real dimension of the real Grassmannian is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = k(n-k)$.\n\nNext, we consider the complex Grassmannian, $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n})$, the space of all $k$-dimensional complex subspaces of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. The analysis is analogous. The unitary group $G = U(n)$ acts transitively on $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n})$. We choose the reference subspace $P_0 = \\mathrm{span}\\{e_1, \\dots, e_k\\}$, where $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ is the standard basis of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\nThe stabilizer subgroup $K$ consists of unitary transformations $g \\in U(n)$ that preserve both $P_0$ and its orthogonal complement $P_0^{\\perp}$. Such transformations have a block-diagonal form:\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} A & 0 \\\\ 0 & B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $A \\in U(k)$ and $B \\in U(n-k)$. The stabilizer is thus $K \\cong U(k) \\times U(n-k)$.\nThis gives the identification $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n}) \\cong U(n)/(U(k) \\times U(n-k))$.\n\nTo find the dimension, we need the real dimension of the unitary group $U(m)$. The Lie algebra of $U(m)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{u}(m)$, consists of all $m \\times m$ skew-Hermitian matrices ($X^* = -X$). A general $m \\times m$ matrix over $\\mathbb{C}$ has $2m^2$ real parameters. The condition $X^* = -X$ implies that the diagonal entries must be purely imaginary ($m$ real parameters) and the entry $X_{ij}$ for $i < j$ determines the entry $X_{ji} = -\\overline{X_{ij}}$ ($2 \\times \\frac{m(m-1)}{2} = m(m-1)$ real parameters). The total number of independent real parameters is $m + m(m-1) = m^2$. Thus, the real dimension of $U(m)$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} U(m) = m^2$.\n\nWe now compute the real dimension of the complex Grassmannian:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} U(n) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(U(k) \\times U(n-k))\n$$\n$$\n= \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} U(n) - (\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} U(k) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} U(n-k))\n$$\n$$\n= n^2 - (k^2 + (n-k)^2)\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n= n^2 - (k^2 + n^2 - 2nk + k^2)\n$$\n$$\n= n^2 - k^2 - n^2 + 2nk - k^2\n$$\n$$\n= 2nk - 2k^2 = 2k(n-k)\n$$\nSo, the real dimension of the complex Grassmannian is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n}) = 2k(n-k)$. This is consistent with the fact that the complex dimension of $Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n})$ is $k(n-k)$, and the real dimension of a complex manifold is twice its complex dimension.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of real dimensions $(\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{R}^{n}), \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} Gr_{k}(\\mathbb{C}^{n}))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk(n-k) & 2k(n-k)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3040654"}, {"introduction": "A remarkable feature of symmetric spaces is that their geometric properties, like curvature, are entirely encoded in their Lie algebraic structure.

Therefore, the resulting matrix is:\n$$\n[H,E_{kl}] = (H_k - H_l) E_{kl}\n$$\nThis equation holds for all $H \\in \\mathfrak{a}$. If we define the linear functional $\\alpha_{kl} \\in \\mathfrak{a}^*$ as $\\alpha_{kl}(H) = H_k - H_l$ for $k \\neq l$ (as given in the problem), we see that\n$$\n[H, E_{kl}] = \\alpha_{kl}(H) E_{kl}.\n$$\nSince for any $k \\neq l$ we can choose an $H \\in \\mathfrak{a}$ such that $H_k \\neq H_l$ (e.g., $H_k=1$, $H_l=-1$, and other entries adjusted to maintain zero trace), the functional $\\alpha_{kl}$ is not the zero functional.

For such an $H$, the equation requires that $X_{ij}=0$. Therefore, any matrix $X$ in the root space $\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha_{kl}}$ can only have a non-zero entry at the $(k,l)$ position. This means $X$ must be a scalar multiple of $E_{kl}$.\nThus, the root space corresponding to $\\alpha_{kl}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha_{kl}} = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\{E_{kl}\\}\n$$\nThe dimension of this space is $1$.

There are $n$ choices for the first index, $i$. For each such choice, there are $n-1$ remaining choices for the second index, $j$, since $j \\neq i$.\nThe total number of such pairs is $n(n-1)$.\nTherefore, the value of $D(n)$ is:\n$$\nD(n) = n(n-1) = n^2-n\n$$\nAs a consistency check, we can use the Lie algebra decomposition $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{g}_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{\\alpha \\in \\Sigma} \\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha$.
