A $G$-invariant Riemannian metric on $G/\\{e\\}$ arises from an inner product on $\\mathfrak{g}$ if and only if the inner product is invariant under the adjoint representation $\\operatorname{Ad}(G)$.\n\nC. For the left action of $G$ on $G/\\{e\\}$, the isotropy group at the identity $e$ is $G$, so the inner product at $T_{e}G$ must be $\\operatorname{Ad}(G)$-invariant to define a $G$-invariant metric.\n\nD.

It asks to identify the correct relationship between left-invariant metrics on a Lie group $G$ and inner products on its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nA left-invariant Riemannian metric $g$ on $G$ is one that is preserved by all left translations $L_x$ for $x \\in G$. The invariance condition is $g_{xy}((dL_x)_y u, (dL_x)_y v) = g_y(u, v)$. Setting $y=e$ (the identity), we get $g_x((dL_x)_e X, (dL_x)_e Y) = g_e(X, Y)$ for any $X, Y \\in T_eG \\cong \\mathfrak{g}$. This shows that the entire metric $g$ is uniquely determined by its value at the identity, $g_e$, which is an inner product on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. Let's denote this inner product by $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle = g_e(\\cdot, \\cdot)$.\n\nConversely, starting with an arbitrary inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ on $\\mathfrak{g}$, we can define a metric $g$ on all of $G$ by \"left-translating\" this inner product:\n$$\ng_x(u, v) := \\langle (dL_{x^{-1}})_x u, (dL_{x^{-1}})_x v \\rangle\n$$\nfor any $u,v \\in T_xG$. This defines a smooth, positive-definite symmetric bilinear form at each point, i.e., a Riemannian metric. This metric is left-invariant by construction. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between left-invariant Riemannian metrics on $G$ and inner products on $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n- **A**: This statement accurately describes the one-to-one correspondence derived above. The formula $g_{x}\\bigl(dL_{x}X,\\,dL_{x}Y\\bigr)=\\langle X, Y\\rangle$ is precisely the statement that the metric at point $x$ is defined by pulling back vectors to the identity and using the inner product there. This is correct.\n- **B**: The condition of $\\operatorname{Ad}(G)$-invariance on the inner product corresponds to the metric being *bi-invariant* (both left- and right-invariant). Since the problem only concerns left-invariance ($G$-invariance for the left action), this extra condition is not necessary. Any inner product on $\\mathfrak{g}$ will generate a left-invariant metric. This statement is incorrect.\n- **C**: The isotropy group of the identity element $e$ under the left action $g \\cdot x = gx$ is the set of $g \\in G$ such that $ge=e$, which is just the trivial group $H = \\{e\\}$. The statement that the isotropy group is $G$ is false.\n- **D**: The correspondence holds for any Lie group, regardless of compactness. The existence of an inner product on the finite-dimensional vector space $\\mathfrak{g}$ is always guaranteed, and thus a left-invariant metric always exists. This statement is incorrect.\n- **E**: This statement incorrectly reverses the roles of left and right invariance. The construction using left translations yields a left-invariant metric. It is right-invariant only if the inner product is $\\operatorname{Ad}(G)$-invariant.
