It is a well-posed question in Riemannian geometry, grounded in the standard definitions of normal coordinates, the geodesic symmetry map, and the transformation laws for connection coefficients.\n\nLet $(M,g)$ be a smooth Riemannian manifold. Let $p \\in M$. We are given two coordinate charts centered at $p$:\n1. A normal coordinate chart $x=(x^a)$, in which $x(p)=0$ and the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection, denoted $\\bar{\\Gamma}^a_{bc}(x)$, vanish at $p$. That is, $\\bar{\\Gamma}^a_{bc}(p) = 0$.\n2. An arbitrary smooth coordinate chart $y=(y^i)$, in which $y(p)=0$, with Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^i_{jk}(y)$.\n\nThe geodesic symmetry map $s_p: M \\to M$ is defined locally by $s_p(\\exp_p(v)) = \\exp_p(-v)$ for $v \\in T_pM$. In a normal coordinate system $x$ centered at $p$, the exponential map is given by $\\exp_p(v) \\mapsto (v^1, \\dots, v^n)$ where $v = v^a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a}|_p$. Thus, the action of $s_p$ corresponds to negating the vector in the tangent space, which translates to negating the coordinates. So, in the $x$-chart, if a point has coordinates $x$, its image under $s_p$ has coordinates $-x$.\n\nOur goal is to find the expression for $s_p$ in the $y$-coordinate chart. Let a point $q$ near $p$ have coordinates $y(q) = (y^1, \\dots, y^n)$. We want to find the coordinates of its image, $S(y) = y(s_p(q))$.\n\nThe strategy is to transform from $y$-coordinates to $x$-coordinates, apply the map, and then transform back to $y$-coordinates. Let the coordinate transformation functions be $x = x(y)$ and its inverse $y = y(x)$. The map $S(y)$ can be expressed as the composition of functions:\n$$S(y) = y(s_p(x(y)))$$\nIn the $x$-coordinates, the map is $x \\mapsto -x$. So we have:\n$$S^i(y^1, \\dots, y^n) = y^i(-x^1(y), \\dots, -x^n(y))$$\nWe will find the Taylor expansion of $S^i(y)$ around $y=0$ up to the second order. This requires the Taylor expansions of the coordinate change functions $x(y)$ and $y(x)$ around the origin. Einstein summation convention is used throughout.\n\nThe Taylor expansion of $x^a(y)$ around $y=0$ is:\n$$x^a(y) = x^a(0) + \\frac{\\partial x^a}{\\partial y^j}\\bigg|_0 y^j + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 x^a}{\\partial y^j \\partial y^k}\\bigg|_0 y^j y^k + O(|y|^3)$$\nSince both coordinate systems are centered at $p$, $x(0)=0$. Let us denote the Jacobian and Hessian matrices at the origin as:\n$$J^a_j = \\frac{\\partial x^a}{\\partial y^j}\\bigg|_0 \\quad , \\quad H^a_{jk} = \\frac{\\partial^2 x^a}{\\partial y^j \\partial y^k}\\bigg|_0$$\nSo, $x^a(y) = J^a_j y^j + \\frac{1}{2} H^a_{jk} y^j y^k + O(|y|^3)$.\n\nSimilarly, the Taylor expansion of $y^i(x)$ around $x=0$ is:\n$$y^i(x) = y^i(0) + \\frac{\\partial y^i}{\\partial x^a}\\bigg|_0 x^a + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 y^i}{\\partial x^a \\partial x^b}\\bigg|_0 x^a x^b + O(|x|^3)$$\nWith $y(0)=0$ and notations for the derivatives:\n$$\\tilde{J}^i_a = \\frac{\\partial y^i}{\\partial x^a}\\bigg|_0 \\quad , \\quad \\tilde{H}^i_{ab} = \\frac{\\partial^2 y^i}{\\partial x^a \\partial x^b}\\bigg|_0$$\nSo, $y^i(x) = \\tilde{J}^i_a x^a + \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{H}^i_{ab} x^a x^b + O(|x|^3)$. The matrices $J$ and $\\tilde{J}$ are inverses, so $J^a_i \\tilde{J}^i_b = \\delta^a_b$ and $\\tilde{J}^i_a J^a_j = \\delta^i_j$.\n\nNow, we expand $S^i(y) = y^i(-x(y))$:\n$$S^i(y) = \\tilde{J}^i_a (-x^a(y)) + \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{H}^i_{ab} (-x^a(y))(-x^b(y)) + O(|x|^3)$$\nSince $x(y)$ is of order $y$, $O(|x|^3) = O(|y|^3)$.\n$$S^i(y) = -\\tilde{J}^i_a x^a(y) + \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{H}^i_{ab} x^a(y)x^b(y) + O(|y|^3)$$\nSubstitute the expansion of $x^a(y)$:\n$$x^a(y) = J^a_j y^j + \\frac{1}{2}H^a_{jk} y^j y^k + O(|y|^3)$$\nTo compute $S^i(y)$ to second order in $y$, we only need $x^a(y)x^b(y)$ to second order:\n$$x^a(y)x^b(y) = (J^a_j y^j)(J^b_k y^k) + O(|y|^3) = J^a_j J^b_k y^j y^k + O(|y|^3)$$\nSubstituting these into the expansion for $S^i(y)$:\n$$S^i(y) = -\\tilde{J}^i_a \\left( J^a_j y^j + \\frac{1}{2}H^a_{jk} y^j y^k \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{H}^i_{ab} (J^a_j J^b_k y^j y^k) + O(|y|^3)$$\n$$S^i(y) = -(\\tilde{J}^i_a J^a_j) y^j + \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{J}^i_a H^a_{jk} + \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{H}^i_{ab} J^a_j J^b_k \\right) y^j y^k + O(|y|^3)$$\nUsing $\\tilde{J}^i_a J^a_j = \\delta^i_j$, the linear term is $-\\delta^i_j y^j = -y^i$.\n$$S^i(y) = -y^i + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\tilde{H}^i_{ab} J^a_j J^b_k - \\tilde{J}^i_a H^a_{jk} \\right) y^j y^k + O(|y|^3)$$\nThe next step is to relate the Hessian terms $H^a_{jk}$ and $\\tilde{H}^i_{ab}$ to the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^i_{jk}(p)$ using their transformation law.

Let's compute each part.\nFirst part:\n$$ \\tilde{H}^i_{ab} J^a_j J^b_k = (-\\Gamma^i_{lm}(p) \\tilde{J}^l_a \\tilde{J}^m_b) J^a_j J^b_k = -\\Gamma^i_{lm}(p) (\\tilde{J}^l_a J^a_j) (\\tilde{J}^m_b J^b_k) = -\\Gamma^i_{lm}(p) \\delta^l_j \\delta^m_k = -\\Gamma^i_{jk}(p) $$\nSecond part:\n$$ -\\tilde{J}^i_a H^a_{jk} = -\\tilde{J}^i_a (J^a_l \\Gamma^l_{jk}(p)) = -(\\tilde{J}^i_a J^a_l) \\Gamma^l_{jk}(p) = -\\delta^i_l \\Gamma^l_{jk}(p) = -\\Gamma^i_{jk}(p) $$\nCombining these, the coefficient of $\\frac{1}{2}y^j y^k$ is $-\\Gamma^i_{jk}(p) - \\Gamma^i_{jk}(p) = -2\\Gamma^i_{jk}(p)$.\nThe total quadratic term in the expansion is therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} (-2\\Gamma^i_{jk}(p)) y^j y^k = -\\Gamma^i_{jk}(p) y^j y^k$$\nFinally, assembling the Taylor series for $S^i(y)$:\n$$S^i(y) = -y^i - \\Gamma^i_{jk}(p) y^j y^k + O(|y|^3)$$\nThis gives the coordinate expression for the geodesic symmetry map in the $y$-chart up to the second order.

The component is evaluated in Riemannian normal coordinates $(x^1, x^2)$ centered at $p$, at the point with coordinates $(t, 0)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the tensor $\\Delta$. The geodesic symmetry map $s_p$ is defined as $s_p = \\exp_p \\circ (-\\mathrm{Id}) \\circ \\exp_p^{-1}$. In normal coordinates $(x^i)$ centered at $p$, the exponential map $\\exp_p$ corresponds to mapping a vector $v \\in T_pM$ to the point with coordinates $v^i$.

We are interested in $\\Delta_{22}(t) = g_{22}(-t, 0) - g_{22}(t, 0)$.\n\nTo find the Taylor expansion of $\\Delta_{22}(t)$, we require the Taylor expansion of the metric component $g_{22}$ in normal coordinates. A standard result in Riemannian geometry states that for normal coordinates $(x^i)$ centered at $p$, the metric tensor components have the following expansion:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3} R_{ikjl}(p) x^k x^l - \\frac{1}{6} (\\nabla_m R_{ikjl})(p) x^k x^l x^m + O(|x|^4) $$\nwhere $R_{ikjl}$ are the components of the Riemann curvature tensor and $\\nabla_m$ is the covariant derivative, all evaluated at $p$.

The cut locus is formed by two sets of points: (i) the first conjugate points to $p$ along all geodesics starting at $p$, and (ii) points $q$ to which there are at least two distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$. The length of the shortest nontrivial geodesic loop at $p$, $L_{\\min}(p)$, corresponds to twice the distance to a point of type (ii). Therefore, the injectivity radius is given by the formula:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\min\\left( d_{conj}(p), \\frac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p) \\right)\n    $$\n    where $d_{conj}(p)$ is the infimum of distances to first conjugate points along all geodesics from $p$.\n\n3.  **Geodesic Symmetry Map**: The map $s_p(x) = \\exp_p(-\\exp_p^{-1}(x))$ is well-defined and smooth on the open ball $B(p,r)$ for any $r \\le \\operatorname{inj}(p)$. This is because for such an $r$, the map $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism from the open ball $B_r(0) \\subset T_pM$ onto $B(p,r) \\subset M$.\n\nWith these principles, I will evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. If $K \\le \\kappa$ with $\\kappa>0$, then for every $p \\in M$ there are no conjugate points to $p$ along any geodesic segment of length less than $\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. Consequently, $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ cannot be smaller than both $\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ and $\\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p)$, and therefore $s_p$ is well-defined and smooth on $B(p,r)$ for every $r<\\operatorname{inj}(p)$.**\n\n-   The first part of the statement, \"there are no conjugate points to $p$ along any geodesic segment of length less than $\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$\", is a direct consequence of the Rauch Comparison Theorem, as explained above. The distance to the first conjugate point along any geodesic from $p$, $d_{conj}(p)$, must satisfy $d_{conj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. This part is correct.\n\n-   The second part states, \"Consequently, $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ cannot be smaller than both $\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ and $\\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p)$.\" This phrasing means that $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ must be greater than or equal to at least one of these two values. This is equivalent to saying $\\operatorname{inj}(p) \\ge \\min(\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}, \\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p))$. Using the formula for the injectivity radius, $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\min(d_{conj}(p), \\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p))$. Since we have established $d_{conj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, it follows that $\\operatorname{inj}(p) \\ge \\min(\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}, \\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p))$. This result is a version of Klingenberg's Lemma. This part is correct.\n\n-   The third part, \"and therefore $s_p$ is well-defined and smooth on $B(p,r)$ for every $r<\\operatorname{inj}(p)$\", is a direct consequence of the definition of the injectivity radius. The map $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism from $B_r(0) \\subseteq T_pM$ to its image $B(p,r)$ for any $r < \\operatorname{inj}(p)$. Consequently, its inverse $\\exp_p^{-1}$ is well-defined and smooth on $B(p,r)$. Since the antipodal map $v \\mapsto -v$ on $T_pM$ is smooth, the composition $s_p(x) = \\exp_p(-\\exp_p^{-1}(x))$ is also well-defined and smooth on this domain. This part is correct.\n\nSince all parts of the statement are correct consequences of standard theorems and definitions, the entire statement is justified.\n\nVerdict for A: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $\\lvert K\\rvert \\le \\kappa$ with $\\kappa>0$, then $\\operatorname{inj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ for all $p \\in M$, and $s_p$ is well-defined and smooth on $B(p,\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$.**\n\n-   The hypothesis is $|K| \\le \\kappa$, which implies $K \\le \\kappa$. As in statement A, this gives a lower bound on the distance to conjugate points: $d_{conj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\n-   The injectivity radius is $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\min(d_{conj}(p), \\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p))$.\n-   The statement claims $\\operatorname{inj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. This would require $\\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ to hold as well.\n-   The hypothesis $|K| \\le \\kappa$ (which includes $K \\ge -\\kappa$) does not provide a universal lower bound on the length of the shortest geodesic loop, $L_{\\min}(p)$.\n-   Consider a counterexample: the product manifold $M = S^n_{1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}} \\times S^1_\\epsilon$, where $S^n_{1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$ is the $n$-sphere of radius $1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ (constant curvature $\\kappa$) and $S^1_\\epsilon$ is a circle of radius $\\epsilon/(2\\pi)$ (length $\\epsilon$). The sectional curvatures of this product manifold are either $\\kappa$ (for planes tangent to the $S^n$ factor) or $0$ (for planes containing the $S^1$ tangent direction). Thus, $0 \\le K \\le \\kappa$, which satisfies $|K| \\le \\kappa$.\n-   For any point $p \\in M$, the geodesic loop that wraps around the $S^1$ factor has length $\\epsilon$. We can choose $\\epsilon$ to be arbitrarily small. Thus, $L_{\\min}(p) = \\epsilon$.\n-   The injectivity radius is then $\\operatorname{inj}(p) \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p) = \\epsilon/2$. For sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, we will have $\\epsilon/2 < \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\n-   Therefore, the claim $\\operatorname{inj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ is false in general. Consequently, the claim that $s_p$ is well-defined on $B(p,\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$ is also false.\n\nVerdict for B: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If $K \\le 0$ and $M$ is complete, then $\\exp_p$ is a global diffeomorphism for each $p \\in M$, and $s_p$ is a globally defined Riemannian isometry of $M$.**\n\n-   The Cartan-Hadamard theorem states that for a complete, connected manifold $M$ with non-positive sectional curvature ($K \\le 0$), the exponential map $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}: T_{\\tilde{p}}\\tilde{M} \\to \\tilde{M}$ is a diffeomorphism, where $\\tilde{M}$ is the universal cover of $M$.\n-   The statement claims $\\exp_p: T_pM \\to M$ is a global diffeomorphism. This is true only if $M$ is simply connected (i.e., $M=\\tilde{M}$). If $M$ is not simply connected, $\\exp_p$ is a covering map but not injective. A simple counterexample is a flat torus $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$, which has $K=0$ and is complete, but is not simply connected. For the torus, $\\exp_p$ is not a global diffeomorphism. The first part of the statement is false.\n\n-   The second part claims that $s_p$ is a globally defined Riemannian isometry. For $s_p$ to be globally defined, $\\exp_p$ must be a global diffeomorphism, which we have shown to be false in general. Even if we assume $M$ is simply connected (so $s_p$ is globally defined), the claim that $s_p$ is an isometry for all $p$ is a defining property of a Riemannian symmetric space. A complete, simply connected manifold with $K \\le 0$ (a Hadamard manifold) is not necessarily a symmetric space. The condition for being a symmetric space is much stronger, typically expressed as the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor being zero, $\\nabla R=0$. The condition $K \\le 0$ does not imply this.\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. There is a universal constant $c=c(n,\\kappa)>0$ such that on every compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with $\\lvert K\\rvert \\le \\kappa$ one has $\\operatorname{inj}(p)\\ge c$ for all $p \\in M$. Hence $s_p$ is defined on $B(p,c)$ for all $p \\in M$.**\n\n-   This statement claims a uniform lower bound on the injectivity radius for all compact manifolds with bounded sectional curvature, depending only on the dimension $n$ and the curvature bound $\\kappa$.\n-   This statement is false. Consider the family of flat $n$-tori $M_\\epsilon = \\mathbb{R}^n / (\\epsilon L_1 \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus L_2 \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus L_n \\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\{L_i\\}$ are orthogonal vectors. Let $L_1$ be a unit vector and let $L_i$ for $i \\ge 2$ define a fixed lattice. The metric is flat, so $K=0$, which satisfies $|K| \\le \\kappa$ for any $\\kappa \\ge 0$. The manifold is compact. The injectivity radius of $M_\\epsilon$ is $\\epsilon/2$. By letting $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we get a sequence of compact $n$-manifolds with uniformly bounded curvature whose injectivity radii converge to $0$.\n-   This phenomenon is known as \"collapsing\". To obtain a uniform positive lower bound on the injectivity radius, additional assumptions are needed, such as an upper bound on the diameter or a lower bound on the volume of the manifold. Since the statement lacks such assumptions, it is incorrect.\n\nVerdict for D: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If $K \\le \\kappa$ and every nontrivial geodesic loop based at $p$ has length at least $2\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, then $\\operatorname{inj}(p)\\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ and $s_p$ is well-defined and smooth on $B(p,\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$.**\n\n-   Let's analyze the claim using the formula for the injectivity radius, $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\min(d_{conj}(p), \\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p))$. The problem provides two hypotheses for a point $p$ on a complete manifold:\n    1.  $K \\le \\kappa$: As established from the Rauch Comparison Theorem, this implies that the distance to the first conjugate point from $p$ satisfies $d_{conj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ (if $\\kappa>0$) or $d_{conj}(p) = \\infty$ (if $\\kappa \\le 0$). In both cases, the inequality $d_{conj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ holds, interpreting $\\pi/\\sqrt{0}$ as $\\infty$.\n    2.  Every nontrivial geodesic loop based at $p$ has length at least $2\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$: This directly means $L_{\\min}(p) \\ge 2\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. This implies $\\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\n\n-   Substituting these two lower bounds into the formula for $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\min(d_{conj}(p), \\tfrac{1}{2}L_{\\min}(p)) \\ge \\min(\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}, \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}) = \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}.\n    $$\n-   Thus, the first part of the conclusion, $\\operatorname{inj}(p)\\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, is correct.\n-   The second part states that $s_p$ is well-defined and smooth on $B(p,\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$. Since $\\operatorname{inj}(p) \\ge \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, the map $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism from $B_r(0)$ to $B(p,r)$ for any $r \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. Therefore, $s_p$ is well-defined and smooth on the open ball $B(p, \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$. This part is also correct.\n\nThe entire statement is a direct and correct logical deduction from the given hypotheses and standard theorems of Riemannian geometry.\n\nVerdict for E: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "3071589"}]}
