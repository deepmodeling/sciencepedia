Let Greek indices $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\{1,\\dots,p\\}$ and Latin indices $a,b,c \\in \\{1,\\dots,q\\}$ distinguish the blocks. The metric is $g=g_{\\alpha\\beta}(x,y)(dx^{\\alpha}dx^{\\beta}) \\oplus g_{ab}(x,y)(dy^{a}dy^{b})$.\n\nThe mixed Christoffel symbols fall into four types: $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{ab}$, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta}$, $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{a\\beta}$, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha b}$.\n- $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{cd}(\\partial_{\\alpha}g_{\\beta d} + \\partial_{\\beta}g_{\\alpha d} - \\partial_{d}g_{\\alpha\\beta})$. Since $g$ is block-diagonal, $g_{\\beta d}=g_{\\alpha d}=0$. Thus, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\\partial_{d}g_{\\alpha\\beta}$. This vanishes for all $\\alpha,\\beta,c$ if and only if $\\partial_{d}g_{\\alpha\\beta} = 0$ for all $d,\\alpha,\\beta$, which is the condition $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$.\n- Similarly, $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{ab} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\gamma\\delta}\\partial_{\\delta}g_{ab}$. This vanishes for all $a,b,\\gamma$ if and only if $\\partial_{\\delta}g_{ab}=0$ for all $\\delta,a,b$, which is $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$.\n- $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{a\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\gamma\\delta}(\\partial_{a}g_{\\beta\\delta} + \\partial_{\\beta}g_{a\\delta} - \\partial_{\\delta}g_{a\\beta})$. The last two terms vanish. So $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{a\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\gamma\\delta}\\partial_{a}g_{\\beta\\delta}$. This vanishes iff $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$.\n- Similarly, $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\alpha b} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\\partial_{\\alpha}g_{bd}$. This vanishes iff $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$.\n\nThus, all mixed Christoffel symbols vanish if and only if $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$ and $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$.\n\nA distribution $D$ is parallel if for any vector field $X$ on the manifold and any section $Y$ of $D$, $\\nabla_{X}Y$ is also a section of $D$.\nLet's check parallelism of $E=\\mathrm{span}\\{\\partial_{\\alpha}\\}$. Take $X=\\partial_{\\beta}$ and $Y=\\partial_{\\gamma}$ (both in $E$). $\\nabla_{\\partial_{\\beta}}\\partial_{\\gamma} = \\Gamma^{\\delta}_{\\beta\\gamma}\\partial_{\\delta} + \\Gamma^{c}_{\\beta\\gamma}\\partial_{c}$. For this to be in $E$, we need $\\Gamma^{c}_{\\beta\\gamma}=0$. Now take $X=\\partial_{a}$ (in $F$) and $Y=\\partial_{\\gamma}$ (in $E$). $\\nabla_{\\partial_{a}}\\partial_{\\gamma} = \\Gamma^{\\delta}_{a\\gamma}\\partial_{\\delta} + \\Gamma^{c}_{a\\gamma}\\partial_{c}$. For this to be in $E$, we need $\\Gamma^{c}_{a\\gamma}=0$. Parallelism of $F$ similarly requires $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{ab}=0$ and $\\Gamma^{\\gamma}_{b\\alpha}=0$.\nTherefore, the distributions $E$ and $F$ are both parallel if and only if all mixed Christoffel symbols vanish.\n\nBy the Frobenius theorem, a parallel distribution is always integrable. When the tangent bundle splits into a direct sum of orthogonal, parallel distributions, $TM=E \\oplus F$, the manifold is locally isometric to a Riemannian product of the integral submanifolds of $E$ and $F$.\n\nConversely, if $(M,g)$ is locally a Riemannian product $(U_{1} \\times U_{2}, g_{1} \\oplus g_{2})$, then in product coordinates $(x,y)$, the metric components are $g_{\\alpha\\beta}(x)$ and $g_{ab}(y)$. By definition, this means $\\partial_{y}g_{(1)} \\equiv 0$ and $\\partial_{x}g_{(2)} \\equiv 0$, which implies all mixed Christoffel symbols are zero.\n\nThe de Rham decomposition theorem is a global statement: a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is isometric to a Riemannian product $M_{0} \\times M_{1} \\times \\dots \\times M_{k}$ (where $M_{0}$ is a Euclidean space and $M_{i}$ are irreducible) if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ acts reducibly on the tangent space. The local criterion derived above (vanishing of mixed Christoffel symbols) is the infinitesimal condition for the holonomy group to be reducible, preserving the subspaces $E$ and $F$. Thus, it is the local version of the geometric condition underlying the de Rham theorem.\n\n**3) Computation of $F(x^{1},x^{2},y)$**\n\nThe function $F$ is defined as the sum of squares of specific Christoffel symbols:\n$$\nF = (\\Gamma^{3}_{11})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{3}_{22})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{1}_{33})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{1}_{13})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{2}_{23})^{2}+(\\Gamma^{3}_{31})^{2}\n$$\nThe problem statement makes no mention of $x^2$ in the definition of $F$, so it is implicitly a function of $x^1$ and $y$.

Verification of Involutivity of $\\mathcal{D}$\n\nA distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is defined as involutive if for any two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ with values in $\\mathcal{D}$ (i.e., $X, Y \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{D})$), their Lie bracket $[X, Y]$ also takes values in $\\mathcal{D}$.\nBy definition of $\\mathcal{D}$, a vector field $X$ is in $\\Gamma(\\mathcal{D})$ if and only if $\\omega(X) = 0$. Thus, to prove involutivity, we must show that for any $X, Y \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{D})$, we have $\\omega([X,Y]) = 0$.\n\nWe use the standard identity for the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ of a $1$-form $\\omega$ evaluated on vector fields $X$ and $Y$:\n$$ d\\omega(X, Y) = X(\\omega(Y)) - Y(\\omega(X)) - \\omega([X, Y]) $$\nIn our case, $X$ and $Y$ are sections of $\\mathcal{D}$, so $\\omega(X)$ and $\\omega(Y)$ are the zero function on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Applying a vector field (which is a directional derivative operator on functions) to the zero function yields zero. Thus, $X(\\omega(Y)) = X(0) = 0$ and $Y(\\omega(X)) = Y(0) = 0$.\nThe identity simplifies to:\n$$ d\\omega(X, Y) = - \\omega([X, Y]) $$\nTherefore, the condition for involutivity, $\\omega([X, Y]) = 0$, is equivalent to the condition $d\\omega(X,Y)=0$ for all $X,Y \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{D})$.\n\nWe can establish this by computing $d\\omega$ directly. The $1$-form is $\\omega = df$. A fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that it is nilpotent of order $2$, meaning $d(d\\phi) = 0$ for any smooth function (or $0$-form) $\\phi$. Applying this with $\\phi = f$, we get:\n$$ d\\omega = d(df) = 0 $$\nThe exterior derivative $d\\omega$ is the zero $2$-form on all of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Consequently, $d\\omega(X, Y) = 0$ for any pair of vector fields $X, Y$, including those in $\\Gamma(\\mathcal{D})$.\nSubstituting this into our simplified identity, we find:\n$$ 0 = - \\omega([X, Y]) \\implies \\omega([X, Y]) = 0 $$\nThis confirms that $[X,Y]$ is in $\\Gamma(\\mathcal{D})$. Therefore, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is involutive. This is a specific instance of the Frobenius integrability theorem: a distribution is integrable if and only if it is involutive. Since $\\mathcal{D}$ is the kernel of a closed $1$-form ($\\omega=df$, so $d\\omega=0$), it is involutive.\n\n2.

Let's analyze the orthogonal complement $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$.\nSince $\\mathcal{D} = \\ker(df)$, its orthogonal complement $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$ is the rank-$1$ distribution (a line bundle) spanned by the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$. In the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the gradient is given by:\n$$ \\nabla f = g^{ij}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}}\\partial_{i} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\partial_{x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\partial_{y} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\partial_{z} = -2x \\partial_{x} - 2y \\partial_{y} + 1 \\partial_{z} $$\nThe unit normal field spanning $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$ is $n = \\frac{\\nabla f}{\\|\\nabla f\\|}$.

This means $\\nabla_{Y}n$ must lie in $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$.\n\nTo test this condition, we choose a specific vector field $Y$ and evaluate the covariant derivative at a convenient point. Let $Y = e_{x} = \\partial_{x}$ and the point be the origin $p = (0,0,0)$. For the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is simply the component-wise directional derivative, so $\\nabla_{\\partial_{x}}n = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}$.\nWe compute the partial derivative of $n$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left((4x^{2}+4y^{2}+1)^{-1/2}\\right) (-2x\\partial_{x} -2y\\partial_{y} + \\partial_{z}) + (4x^{2}+4y^{2}+1)^{-1/2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-2x\\partial_{x} -2y\\partial_{y} + \\partial_{z}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{2}(4x^{2}+4y^{2}+1)^{-3/2}(8x) n \\|\\nabla f\\| + (4x^{2}+4y^{2}+1)^{-1/2}(-2\\partial_{x}) $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the origin $p=(0,0,0)$:\n$$ n(p) = \\frac{0\\partial_{x} + 0\\partial_{y} + \\partial_{z}}{\\sqrt{0+0+1}} = \\partial_{z} $$\n$$ \\nabla_{e_{x}}n \\Big|_{p} = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\\Big|_{p} = -\\frac{1}{2}(1)^{-3/2}(0) (\\dots) + (1)^{-1/2}(-2\\partial_{x}) = -2\\partial_{x} $$\nAt the origin, we have $n(p) = \\partial_{z}$ and $\\nabla_{e_{x}}n |_{p} = -2\\partial_{x}$. The vector $-2\\partial_{x}$ is not a scalar multiple of $\\partial_{z}$. In fact, it is orthogonal to it. Since $\\nabla_{e_{x}}n$ has a component orthogonal to $n$, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$ is not parallel. Consequently, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is not parallel.\n\n3. Implication for de Rham Decomposition\n\nThe de Rham decomposition theorem provides conditions under which a Riemannian manifold can be decomposed into a product of lower-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. The local version of the theorem states that a neighborhood $U$ of a point $p$ in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is isometric to a Riemannian product $(U_{1}, g_{1}) \\times (U_{2}, g_{2})$ if and only if the tangent space $T_{p}M$ admits a decomposition into a direct sum of mutually orthogonal subspaces, $T_{p}M = V_{1} \\oplus V_{2}$, which are invariant under the action of the holonomy group at $p$.\n\nA distribution is invariant under holonomy if and only if it is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. In our case, we have a natural orthogonal decomposition of the tangent space at every point: $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{3} = \\mathcal{D}_{p} \\oplus \\mathcal{D}_{p}^{\\perp}$.\nFor this decomposition to give rise to a local Riemannian product structure, where the factors have tangent spaces given by $\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$, both distributions would need to be parallel.\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that $\\mathcal{D}$ is involutive. By Frobenius' theorem, this guarantees that $\\mathcal{D}$ is integrable, meaning $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is foliated by $2$-dimensional submanifolds (the paraboloids $z-x^2-y^2=c$) whose tangent spaces are given by $\\mathcal{D}$.\nHowever, from Part 2, we showed that $\\mathcal{D}$ (and its complement $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$) is not parallel. This means that parallel transport along a curve can map a vector in $\\mathcal{D}$ to a vector with a component in $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$, and vice-versa. The holonomy group does not preserve the splitting $T\\mathbb{R}^{3} = \\mathcal{D} \\oplus \\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$.\nSince the distributions are not parallel, the condition for the local de Rham decomposition theorem is not met. Therefore, despite the existence of an integrable foliation, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with the Euclidean metric does not admit a local Riemannian product decomposition where the factors are tangent to $\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\mathcal{D}^{\\perp}$. Involutivity (integrability) is a weaker condition than parallelism; parallelism is a metric condition that imposes a much stronger \"flatness\" between the distributions, which is absent here.\n\nFinally, to certify non-parallelism with the requested calculation, we compute the squared norm of $\\nabla_{e_{x}} n$ at the origin.\nFrom our calculation in Part 2, we have $\\nabla_{e_{x}} n \\Big|_{p=(0,0,0)} = -2\\partial_{x}$.\nThe squared norm is computed using the Euclidean metric $g$, for which $\\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}\\}$ is an orthonormal basis.\n$$ \\|\\nabla_{e_{x}} n\\|^{2}\\Big|_{p} = g(-2\\partial_{x}, -2\\partial_{x}) = (-2)^{2} g(\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{x}) = 4 \\times 1 = 4 $$\nThis non-zero value confirms that the covariant derivative of $n$ is not zero, and as shown earlier, it is not parallel to $n$, directly demonstrating the non-parallelism of the distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3054010"}, {"introduction": "Even when the local conditions for decomposability are met—for instance, through the existence of a parallel vector field—a manifold may not split into a global product.

All data and definitions are provided, and the questions are answerable through standard mathematical procedures. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe manifold is $M = \\mathbb{S}^{1} \\times (0,1)$ with local coordinates $(\\theta, t)$, where $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$ and $t \\in (0,1)$. The Riemannian metric is given by $g = r^{2}\\, d\\theta^{2} + dt^{2}$, where $r > 0$ is a constant. In the coordinate basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\}$, the metric tensor components are $g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^{2}$, $g_{tt} = 1$, and $g_{\\theta t} = g_{t\\theta} = 0$. The vector field is $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\n\n**1. Proof that $X$ is a parallel vector field**\n\nA vector field $X$ is parallel if its covariant derivative with respect to any vector field $Y$ is zero, i.e., $\\nabla_Y X = 0$. It is sufficient to show this for the basis vector fields $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ and $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. The components of the covariant derivative are given by $(\\nabla_{V} W)^{k} = V^{j}(\\frac{\\partial W^{k}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\Gamma^{k}_{ji} W^{i})$, where $\\Gamma^{k}_{ji}$ are the Christoffel symbols.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$, where we use coordinates $x^1 = \\theta$ and $x^2 = t$.\nThe metric components are $g_{11} = r^2$, $g_{22} = 1$, and $g_{12} = 0$. Since $r$ is a constant, all metric components are constant functions on $M$. Consequently, all their partial derivatives are zero: $\\partial_k g_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$.\n\nThe vector field $X$ is given by $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. In our coordinate system, its components are $X^1 = X^\\theta = 0$ and $X^2 = X^t = 1$. These components are also constants.\n\nNow we compute the covariant derivative of $X$. Let $Y$ be an arbitrary vector field.\n$$(\\nabla_Y X)^k = Y^j \\left( \\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^j} + \\Gamma^k_{ji} X^i \\right)$$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ji}$ are zero, the expression simplifies to:\n$$(\\nabla_Y X)^k = Y^j \\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^j}$$\nThe components of $X$ are $X^1=0$ and $X^2=1$. Their partial derivatives with respect to either coordinate $\\theta$ or $t$ are all zero: $\\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^j} = 0$ for all $j,k$.\nTherefore, $(\\nabla_Y X)^k = 0$ for all components $k$ and any vector field $Y$. This implies $\\nabla_Y X = 0$, which proves that $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is a parallel vector field on $(M,g)$.\n\n**2. Determination of the maximal symmetric interval for the flow**\n\nAn integral curve $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta(s), t(s))$ of the vector field $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ must satisfy the differential equation $\\frac{d\\gamma}{ds} = X(\\gamma(s))$.\nIn coordinates, this equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d}{ds}(\\theta(s), t(s)) = (\\dot{\\theta}(s), \\dot{t}(s))$$\nThe vector field $X$ in this coordinate system has components $(0,1)$, because $X = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\nThus, the system of ordinary differential equations is:\n$$ \\dot{\\theta}(s) = 0 $$\n$$ \\dot{t}(s) = 1 $$\nWe are given the initial condition $\\gamma(0) = (\\theta_0, t_0)$ with $t_0 = \\frac{2}{7}$.\nIntegrating the first equation, $\\theta(s) = C_1$. Using the initial condition $\\theta(0) = \\theta_0$, we get $\\theta(s) = \\theta_0$ for all $s$.\nIntegrating the second equation, $t(s) = s + C_2$. Using the initial condition $t(0) = \\frac{2}{7}$, we get $t(s) = s + \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThe integral curve is therefore $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta_0, s + \\frac{2}{7})$.\n\nThe flow $\\phi_s$ of $X$ exists as long as the point $\\gamma(s)$ remains within the manifold $M = \\mathbb{S}^1 \\times (0,1)$. The $\\theta$-coordinate $\\theta_0$ is constant and always in $\\mathbb{S}^1$. The condition for the curve to be in $M$ is that its $t$-coordinate must lie in the interval $(0,1)$.\n$$ 0 < t(s) < 1 $$\n$$ 0 < s + \\frac{2}{7} < 1 $$\nWe solve this compound inequality for $s$:\n1. $s + \\frac{2}{7} > 0 \\implies s > -\\frac{2}{7}$\n2. $s + \\frac{2}{7} < 1 \\implies s < 1 - \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}$\nThe maximal interval of existence for the flow along this integral curve is $s \\in (-\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{5}{7})$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest symmetric open interval $(-\\rho, \\rho)$ such that the flow exists for all $s \\in (-\\rho, \\rho)$. This interval must be contained within the maximal interval of existence.\n$$ (-\\rho, \\rho) \\subseteq \\left(-\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}\\right) $$\nThis requires that $-\\rho \\ge -\\frac{2}{7}$ and $\\rho \\le \\frac{5}{7}$.\nThe first inequality implies $\\rho \\le \\frac{2}{7}$. To satisfy both conditions, $\\rho$ must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two bounds:\n$$ \\rho \\le \\min\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}\\right) = \\frac{2}{7} $$\nThe largest possible value for $\\rho$ is therefore $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n**3. Explanation regarding the de Rham decomposition theorem**\n\nThe de Rham decomposition theorem states that if a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold $(N,h)$ has a reducible holonomy group, then it splits globally as a Riemannian product $N = N_1 \\times N_2$, where the tangent spaces of $N_1$ and $N_2$ correspond to the invariant subspaces under the holonomy action.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the holonomy of $(M,g)$. As shown in Part 1, the vector field $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is parallel. The existence of a non-zero parallel vector field implies that the holonomy group $\\text{Hol}_p(M)$ at any point $p \\in M$ fixes the vector $X_p \\in T_p M$. Thus, the one-dimensional subspace $\\text{span}\\{X_p\\}$ is a proper, invariant subspace of the tangent space $T_pM$ (which has dimension $2$). By definition, this means the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ is reducible. A local version of the de Rham theorem then implies that $(M,g)$ is locally isometric to a Riemannian product, which is already obvious from its given metric $g = r^2 d\\theta^2 + dt^2$. This is a local product of a circle (locally $\\mathbb{R}$) and a line segment.\n\nHowever, for a *global* splitting guaranteed by the full de Rham theorem, two crucial hypotheses must be met: the manifold must be complete and simply connected. Let's examine these for $(M,g)$.\n\n1.  **Completeness:** A Riemannian manifold is complete if every geodesic can be extended to be defined for all time $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In our case, the parallel vector field $X$ has constant length $\\|X\\|^2 = g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}) = 1$. An integral curve of a unit-length parallel vector field is a geodesic parametrized by arc length. We showed in Part 2 that the integral curve (geodesic) $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta_0, s+t_0)$ is only defined for $s$ in a finite interval, specifically $s \\in (-t_0, 1-t_0)$. Since these geodesics cannot be extended for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete. The incompleteness of the flow of $X$ is a direct manifestation of the incompleteness of the manifold itself.\n\n2.  **Simple-Connectedness:** The manifold $M = \\mathbb{S}^1 \\times (0,1)$ is homotopy equivalent to the circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$. Its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{S}^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$, which is not the trivial group. Therefore, $M$ is not simply connected.\n\nThe de Rham decomposition theorem cannot be applied to $(M,g)$ because it fails to satisfy both the completeness and the simple-connectedness hypotheses. The question specifically directs us to focus on the incompleteness of the flow of $X$. If $(M,g)$ were to admit a global splitting into $N \\times \\mathbb{R}$ for some manifold $N$, this would imply the existence of a complete geodesic flow in the $\\mathbb{R}$ direction. The parallel vector field $X$ corresponds to this direction, but its flow (and thus its geodesics) is incomplete. This incompleteness, caused by the fact that the manifold is defined on the open interval $(0,1)$ rather than the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$, is the fundamental obstruction that prevents the local product structure from extending to a global splitting of the form $N \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The manifold's \"edge\" at $t=0$ and $t=1$ terminates the geodesics in finite time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$$", "id": "3053990"}]}
