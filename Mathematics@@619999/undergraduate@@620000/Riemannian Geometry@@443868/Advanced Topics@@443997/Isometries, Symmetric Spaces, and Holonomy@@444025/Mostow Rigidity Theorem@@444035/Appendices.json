The conditions given ($n\\ge 3$, closed, constant curvature $-1$) are exactly the hypotheses of the theorem. The conclusion (isomorphism of $\\pi_1$ is induced by a unique isometry) is the correct statement of the theorem. Thus, statement A is correct.\n\n*   **Option B Analysis:** This statement claims rigidity for dimension $n=2$. This is famously false. For a closed orientable surface of genus $g \\ge 2$, there exists a $(6g-6)$-dimensional space of non-isometric hyperbolic metrics, known as the Teichmüller space. All these different geometries correspond to the same underlying topological surface and hence the same fundamental group. Thus, an isomorphism of fundamental groups does not determine the metric, and rigidity fails spectacularly. Thus, statement B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C Analysis:** This statement considers the case of variable negative curvature for $n \\ge 3$. The Mostow Rigidity Theorem specifically requires constant sectional curvature (i.e., a hyperbolic metric). If this condition is relaxed to merely negative (but not constant) curvature, the rigidity conclusion no longer holds. For a given manifold $M$, one can generally construct a large, infinite-dimensional space of non-isometric Riemannian metrics all having sectional curvatures pinched between two negative constants. The existence of these non-isometric metrics on the same manifold $M$ (which thus all have the same fundamental group) demonstrates the failure of Mostow-style rigidity in this context. Thus, statement C correctly describes this lack of rigidity.\n\n*   **Option D Analysis:** This statement makes a strong claim about rigidity from dynamical invariants like the marked length spectrum (MLS). It is a deep theorem (by Otal for $n=2$ and Croke for $n \\ge 2$) that for negatively curved manifolds, the MLS does determine the metric up to isometry. However, this property holds for *both* constant and variable negative curvature. Therefore, it is not a feature that *distinguishes* the two cases as the problem asks. Furthermore, the phrasing \"or other dynamical invariants\" is vague, and \"without further hypotheses\" is an overstatement, as negative curvature is a major hypothesis. The key distinction is that for constant curvature ($n \\ge 3$), the fundamental group *alone* is sufficient for rigidity, whereas for variable curvature, stronger data like the MLS is required. Thus, statement D is not a good answer to the question.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statements A and C correctly identify the distinct rigidity behaviors.
