It provides all necessary definitions and asks for a standard calculation regarding the curvature of the unit sphere. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $S^{2}$ be the unit sphere in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, defined as $S^{2}=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}:\\|x\\|=1\\}$. The metric on $S^{2}$ is the one induced by the standard Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The problem specifies the outward-pointing unit normal vector field to be $\\nu(p) = p$ for any point $p \\in S^{2}$. The tangent space at a point $p \\in S^2$, denoted $T_p S^2$, is the set of vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $v$ is orthogonal to $p$.\n\nThe shape operator, $S_{p}:T_{p}S^{2}\\to T_{p}S^{2}$, is defined by $S_{p}(v)=-D_{v}\\nu$, where $D$ is the standard covariant derivative on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $v \\in T_{p}S^{2}$. In the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the covariant derivative $D_v Y$ of a vector field $Y$ in the direction of a vector $v$ is simply the directional derivative of the components of $Y$.Let $\\nu(x) = x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ be the vector field on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ whose restriction to $S^2$ is the normal field. Let $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$ be a tangent vector at $p \\in S^2$. The directional derivative of $\\nu$ in the direction $v$ is:\n$$\nD_{v}\\nu = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} v_i \\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial x_i}, \\sum_{i=1}^{3} v_i \\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial x_i}, \\sum_{i=1}^{3} v_i \\frac{\\partial x_3}{\\partial x_i} \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial x_j}{\\partial x_i} = \\delta_{ij}$ (the Kronecker delta), this simplifies to:\n$$\nD_{v}\\nu = (v_1, v_2, v_3) = v\n$$\nThis result, $D_v\\nu = v$, indicates that the derivative of the position vector field in any direction $v$ is simply the vector $v$ itself.\n\nNow, we can determine the action of the shape operator $S_p$ on any tangent vector $v \\in T_pS^2$. Using the given definition:\n$$\nS_{p}(v) = -D_{v}\\nu = -v\n$$\nThis shows that the shape operator $S_p$ at any point $p \\in S^2$ is the negative of the identity map on the tangent space $T_pS^2$. That is, $S_p = -I_{T_pS^2}$.\n\nThe principal curvatures at $p$, denoted $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$, are the eigenvalues of the shape operator $S_p$. To find these eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation $S_p(v) = \\lambda v$ for a non-zero vector $v \\in T_pS^2$. From our derived expression for $S_p$, we have:\n$$\n-v = \\lambda v\n$$\nThis equation must hold for any $v \\in T_pS^2$. Since $T_pS^2$ is a $2$-dimensional vector space, any non-zero vector is an eigenvector. The equation $(-1)v = \\lambda v$ implies that the only eigenvalue is $\\lambda = -1$. As $T_pS^2$ is $2$-dimensional, this eigenvalue must have a geometric multiplicity of $2$. Therefore, the two principal curvatures are identical:\n$$\n\\kappa_1 = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\kappa_2 = -1\n$$\nPoints where the principal curvatures are equal are called umbilic points. Thus, every point on the unit sphere is an umbilic point.\n\nThe mean curvature scalar $H(p)$ is defined as $H(p)=\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(S_{p})$. The trace of the shape operator is the sum of its eigenvalues (the principal curvatures):\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(S_p) = \\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the mean curvature scalar, we get:\n$$\nH(p) = \\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1\n$$\nSince this result does not depend on the choice of point $p$, the mean curvature scalar $H$ is constant over the entire sphere $S^2$, with a value of $-1$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to determine if $S^2$ is a minimal submanifold. A submanifold is defined as minimal if its mean curvature vector field, $\\vec{H}$, vanishes identically. The mean curvature vector is defined as $\\vec{H} = H\\nu$. Using our computed value for $H$ and the given normal field $\\nu$, we have:\n$$\n\\vec{H}(p) = H(p)\\nu(p) = (-1)p = -p\n$$\nFor any point $p \\in S^2$, the vector $p$ is a unit vector and thus is not the zero vector. Consequently, the mean curvature vector $\\vec{H}(p) = -p$ is never zero. Since the mean curvature vector field does not vanish identically, the unit sphere $S^2$ is not a minimal submanifold under the given conventions. A surface with zero mean curvature has principal curvatures that are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign ($\\kappa_1 = -\\kappa_2$, unless it is flat), which is not the case for the sphere.
