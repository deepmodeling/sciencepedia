Determination of the principal directions.\nThe principal directions are the eigenvectors of the Weingarten map (or shape operator) $S$, whose matrix representation is given by $[S] = [g_{ij}]^{-1}[L_{ij}]$. First, we find the inverse of the matrix of the first fundamental form:\n$$ [g_{ij}]^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  r^2 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{r^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we compute the matrix of the shape operator:\n$$ [S] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{r^2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince the matrix $[S]$ is diagonal with respect to the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_r X, \\partial_\\theta X\\}$, the eigenvectors in the parameter space are simply $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. These correspond to the principal directions in the tangent space:\nThe first principal direction corresponds to the eigenvector $(1,0)$, which is the tangent vector $1 \\cdot X_r + 0 \\cdot X_\\theta = X_r = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta, 1)$. This direction is along the straight-line generators of the cone.\nThe second principal direction corresponds to the eigenvector $(0,1)$, which is the tangent vector $0 \\cdot X_r + 1 \\cdot X_\\theta = X_\\theta = (-r\\sin\\theta, r\\cos\\theta, 0)$. This direction is tangent to the circular cross-sections of the cone.\n\n4. Determination of the corresponding principal curvatures.\nThe principal curvatures, $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$, are the eigenvalues of the shape operator $S$. From the diagonal matrix $[S]$, we can directly read the eigenvalues:\n$$ \\kappa_1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\kappa_2 = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThe zero curvature $\\kappa_1=0$ corresponds to the straight-line direction $X_r$, as expected. The nonzero curvature $\\kappa_2 = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{2}}$ corresponds to the direction $X_\\theta$ along the circular parallels.\n\n5. Discussion of the limiting behavior and the singularity at the apex.\nAs the radial parameter $r$ approaches zero, $r \\to 0^+$, we analyze the behavior of the derived quantities.\nThe principal directions are spanned by $X_r$ and $X_\\theta$. The vector $X_r = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta, 1)$ is independent of $r$. However, the vector $X_\\theta = (-r\\sin\\theta, r\\cos\\theta, 0)$ approaches the zero vector as $r \\to 0^+$. At $r=0$, the vectors $X_r$ and $X_\\theta$ would become linearly dependent, meaning the tangent space is not two-dimensional. The parametrization ceases to be regular at the apex.\nThe principal curvatures behave as follows: $\\kappa_1 = 0$ is constant. The second principal curvature, $\\kappa_2 = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{2}}$, diverges to infinity as $r \\to 0^+$.\nThe apex of the cone, corresponding to $r=0$, is a singular point from the perspective of differential geometry for several reasons. Firstly, the map $X$ is not a homeomorphism in any neighborhood of the apex, as $X(0, \\theta) = (0,0,0)$ for all $\\theta$. Secondly, a regular surface requires a well-defined, two-dimensional tangent plane at every point. At the apex, the tangent space degenerates, and a unique normal vector cannot be defined (as $|X_r \\times X_\\theta| \\to 0$). Thirdly, the unboundedness of one of the principal curvatures as $r \\to 0^+$ is a definitive characteristic of a singularity. A smooth (class $C^2$) surface must have finite principal curvatures. The apex is intuitively a \"sharp point,\" and this is captured mathematically by the infinite curvature.\n\nThe final question asks for the closed-form analytic expression for the nonzero principal curvature as a function of $r$. Based on our derivation, this is $\\kappa_2$.\n$$ \\kappa_2(r) = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2r}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{2}}}$$", "id": "3062302"}, {"introduction": "After working through specific examples, it is crucial to understand the general principles that govern surface geometry.

Subsequently, the proportionality factor $\\lambda$ must be determined.\n\nLet the tangent space at the point $p$ be denoted by $T_pS$. The first fundamental form, $I(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\langle \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} \\rangle$, and the second fundamental form, $II(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\langle S\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} \\rangle$, are symmetric bilinear forms on $T_pS$. Here, $S: T_pS \\to T_pS$ is the shape operator (or Weingarten map). A point $p$ is defined as umbilic if its principal curvatures are equal. The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator $S$. If the eigenvalues are equal to a common value, say $\\lambda$, then the shape operator must be a scalar multiple of the identity map on the tangent space, i.e., $S = \\lambda \\, \\text{Id}$.\n\nThe condition that $p$ is an umbilic point is equivalent to the condition that the second fundamental form is proportional to the first fundamental form. Let us demonstrate this equivalence.\nFirst, assume $p$ is umbilic. Then $S = \\lambda \\, \\text{Id}$ for some scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. From the definition of the second fundamental form, we have $II(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = I(S\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w})$. Substituting $S = \\lambda \\, \\text{Id}$, we get $II(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = I(\\lambda\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w})$. Due to the bilinearity of $I$, this becomes $II(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\lambda I(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w})$. Since this holds for all tangent vectors $\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} \\in T_pS$, we conclude that $II = \\lambda I$.\nConversely, assume that $II = \\lambda I$ for some scalar $\\lambda$. This means $II(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\lambda I(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w})$ for all $\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} \\in T_pS$. Using the definition of $II$ and the bilinearity of $I$, this can be written as $I(S\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = I(\\lambda\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w})$, which implies $I(S\\mathbf{v} - \\lambda\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = 0$ for all $\\mathbf{w} \\in T_pS$. The first fundamental form $I$ is a positive definite inner product, meaning it is non-degenerate. Therefore, the condition $I(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{w})=0$ for all $\\mathbf{w}$ implies $\\mathbf{u}=0$. Applying this to our equation with $\\mathbf{u} = S\\mathbf{v} - \\lambda\\mathbf{v}$, we must have $S\\mathbf{v} - \\lambda\\mathbf{v} = 0$, or $S\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}$. Since this holds for any vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in T_pS$, the shape operator $S$ is $\\lambda$ times the identity map, $S=\\lambda\\,\\text{Id}$. This means its eigenvalues are all equal to $\\lambda$, and thus $p$ is an umbilic point.\n\nNow, we derive the algebraic condition on the coefficients of the fundamental forms. In the coordinate basis $\\{\\mathbf{X}_u, \\mathbf{X}_v\\}$, the first fundamental form is represented by the matrix $\\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} E  F \\\\ F  G \\end{pmatrix}$ and the second fundamental form by $\\mathbf{II} = \\begin{pmatrix} e  f \\\\ f  g \\end{pmatrix}$. The condition $II = \\lambda I$ translates directly to the matrix equation $\\mathbf{II} = \\lambda \\mathbf{I}$, which is\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} e  f \\\\ f  g \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} E  F \\\\ F  G \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix equality yields a system of three linear equations for the single unknown $\\lambda$:\n1) $e = \\lambda E$\n2) $f = \\lambda F$\n3) $g = \\lambda G$\nFor this system to have a consistent solution for $\\lambda$, the vectors $(e, f, g)$ and $(E, F, G)$ must be proportional. This is the necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for the point $p$ to be umbilic. This can be expressed by stating that the rank of the matrix $$ \\begin{pmatrix} E  F  G \\\\ e  f  g \\end{pmatrix} $$ is at most $1$.\n\nTo find the proportionality factor $\\lambda$, we manipulate the system of equations. Since $p$ is umbilic, all three equations hold simultaneously. We are given that the metric is positive definite, so $E > 0$, $G > 0$, and the determinant of the metric matrix $EG - F^2 > 0$. We can construct a linear combination of the three equations to solve for $\\lambda$.
