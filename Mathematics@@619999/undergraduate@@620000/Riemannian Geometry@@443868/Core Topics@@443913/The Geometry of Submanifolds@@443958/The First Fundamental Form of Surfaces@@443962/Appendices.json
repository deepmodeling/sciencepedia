It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in differential geometry that is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first fundamental form of a parametrized surface $X(u,v)$ in three-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ describes the intrinsic geometry of the surface. It is the metric tensor on the surface induced by pulling back the standard Euclidean metric of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The coefficients of the first fundamental form, denoted $E(u,v)$, $F(u,v)$, and $G(u,v)$, are defined by the inner products of the tangent vectors to the coordinate curves.\n\nLet the parametrization of the cone be $X(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v))$, where $x(u,v) = u\\cos v$, $y(u,v) = u\\sin v$, and $z(u,v) = a u$, for a fixed positive constant $a$, with $u > 0$ and $v \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $X(u,v)$ with respect to the parameters $u$ and $v$. These are the tangent vectors along the coordinate curves.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $u$ is:\n$$\nX_u = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial u} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(u\\cos v), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(u\\sin v), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(a u)\\right) = (\\cos v, \\sin v, a)\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $v$ is:\n$$\nX_v = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial v} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(u\\cos v), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(u\\sin v), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(a u)\\right) = (-u\\sin v, u\\cos v, 0)\n$$\n\nThe coefficients of the first fundamental form are defined as the dot products (Euclidean inner products) of these tangent vectors:\n$E(u,v) = X_u \\cdot X_u = \\langle X_u, X_u \\rangle$\n$F(u,v) = X_u \\cdot X_v = \\langle X_u, X_v \\rangle$\n$G(u,v) = X_v \\cdot X_v = \\langle X_v, X_v \\rangle$\n\nWe now compute each coefficient.\nFor $E(u,v)$:\n$$\nE(u,v) = (\\cos v)^2 + (\\sin v)^2 + a^2 = \\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v + a^2\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v = 1$, we get:\n$$\nE(u,v) = 1 + a^2\n$$\n\nFor $F(u,v)$:\n$$\nF(u,v) = (\\cos v)(-u\\sin v) + (\\sin v)(u\\cos v) + (a)(0) = -u\\sin v \\cos v + u\\sin v \\cos v + 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\nF(u,v) = 0\n$$\n\nFor $G(u,v)$:\n$$\nG(u,v) = (-u\\sin v)^2 + (u\\cos v)^2 + 0^2 = u^2\\sin^2 v + u^2\\cos^2 v = u^2(\\sin^2 v + \\cos^2 v)\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v = 1$, we get:\n$$\nG(u,v) = u^2\n$$\n\nThus, the coefficients of the first fundamental form are $E(u,v) = 1+a^2$, $F(u,v) = 0$, and $G(u,v) = u^2$. The line element $ds$ on the surface is given by $ds^2 = E\\,du^2 + 2F\\,du\\,dv + G\\,dv^2$, which in this case is:\n$$\nds^2 = (1+a^2)du^2 + u^2 dv^2\n$$\nThe fact that $F(u,v)=0$ indicates that the coordinate curves ($u=\\text{constant}$ and $v=\\text{constant}$) are orthogonal at every point on the surface. The curves $v=\\text{constant}$ are the straight-line generators of the cone, while the curves $u=\\text{constant}$ are the circular cross-sections.\n\nNext, we discuss the behavior of these coefficients as $u \\to 0$. The point $u=0$ corresponds to the apex of the cone at the origin $(0,0,0)$.\nThe limits are:\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to 0^+} E(u,v) = \\lim_{u \\to 0^+} (1+a^2) = 1+a^2\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to 0^+} F(u,v) = \\lim_{u \\to 0^+} 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to 0^+} G(u,v) = \\lim_{u \\to 0^+} u^2 = 0\n$$\n\nGeometrically, the coefficient $E(u,v) = \\|X_u\\|^2$ represents the squared speed of traversing the surface along the a generator line (a curve of constant $v$). This speed is constant, $\\sqrt{1+a^2}$, which is consistent with the fact that these are straight lines. The coefficient $G(u,v) = \\|X_v\\|^2$ represents the squared speed of traversing the surface along a circular cross-section (a curve of constant $u$). This speed is $\\sqrt{u^2} = u$, which is the radius of the circle at height $au$.\n\nThe behavior of $G(u,v)$ as $u \\to 0^+$ has a clear geometric interpretation. As $u$ approaches $0$, the circular cross-sections shrink in radius. At the limit $u=0$, the circle has radius $0$ and collapses to a single point, the apex of the cone. The vanishing of the coefficient $G(u,v)$ signifies this geometric degeneracy. The tangent vector $X_v$ becomes the zero vector at $u=0$, i.e., $X_v(0,v) = (0,0,0)$. This means the parametrization is not regular at the apex, which is a singular point. The metric tensor becomes degenerate at this point, as the determinant of its matrix representation, $EG - F^2 = (1+a^2)u^2$, goes to zero as $u \\to 0$. This precisely captures the fact that the surface loses its two-dimensional nature at the apex, collapsing locally to a point.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1+a^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & u^2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3070650"}, {"introduction": "The first fundamental form describes the *intrinsic* geometry of a surface, meaning properties that can be measured without leaving the surface itself.

Therefore, we proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a five-part analysis of two different parametrizations of a right circular cylinder of fixed radius $R > 0$ in Euclidean three-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The parameter domain for both is given as $U = \\mathbb{R}\\times(0,2\\pi)$, with parameters $(u,v)$.\n\nPart 1: Construction of the parametrization $X(u,v)$.\nThe conventional parametrization of a right circular cylinder of radius $R$ aligned with the $z$-axis uses the axial coordinate for one parameter and the angular coordinate for the other. We let $u$ be the axial coordinate (height) and $v$ be the angle in the $x,y$-plane. The Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are then given by:\n$x = R \\cos(v)$\n$y = R \\sin(v)$\n$z = u$\nThus, the first parametrization is the vector-valued function $X: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by:\n$$X(u,v) = (R \\cos(v), R \\sin(v), u)$$\n\nPart 2: Construction of the parametrization $Y(u,v)$.\nThe second parametrization is constructed by \"twisting\" the angle linearly along the axis. This means the angle in the $x,y$-plane will be a function of both $u$ and $v$. We introduce a fixed nonzero real constant $a \\neq 0$. The angular coordinate is defined as $v + au$. The axial coordinate remains $u$. This gives the parametrization $Y: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$:\n$$Y(u,v) = (R \\cos(v+au), R \\sin(v+au), u)$$\nBoth $X(U)$ and $Y(U)$ trace out the same surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, namely the cylinder defined by $x^{2} + y^{2} = R^{2}$.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the coefficients of the first fundamental form.\nThe coefficients $E$, $F$, and $G$ of the first fundamental form are defined by the inner products of the partial derivative vectors of the parametrization. For a generic parametrization $Z(u,v)$, we have $Z_u = \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial u}$ and $Z_v = \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial v}$. The coefficients are $E = \\langle Z_u, Z_u \\rangle$, $F = \\langle Z_u, Z_v \\rangle$, and $G = \\langle Z_v, Z_v \\rangle$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the standard Euclidean dot product in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nFor the parametrization $X(u,v)$:\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$X_u = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (R \\cos(v), R \\sin(v), u) = (0, 0, 1)$\n$X_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} (R \\cos(v), R \\sin(v), u) = (-R \\sin(v), R \\cos(v), 0)$\nThe coefficients are:\n$E_X = \\langle X_u, X_u \\rangle = \\langle (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1) \\rangle = 0^{2} + 0^{2} + 1^{2} = 1$\n$F_X = \\langle X_u, X_v \\rangle = \\langle (0, 0, 1), (-R \\sin(v), R \\cos(v), 0) \\rangle = 0 \\cdot (-R \\sin(v)) + 0 \\cdot (R \\cos(v)) + 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n$G_X = \\langle X_v, X_v \\rangle = \\langle (-R \\sin(v), R \\cos(v), 0), (-R \\sin(v), R \\cos(v), 0) \\rangle = (-R \\sin(v))^{2} + (R \\cos(v))^{2} + 0^{2} = R^{2}(\\sin^{2}(v) + \\cos^{2}(v)) = R^{2}$\nThe first fundamental form for $X$ is $ds_X^2 = 1 du^{2} + 0 du dv + R^{2} dv^{2} = du^{2} + R^{2} dv^{2}$.\n\nFor the parametrization $Y(u,v)$:\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$Y_u = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (R \\cos(v+au), R \\sin(v+au), u) = (-aR \\sin(v+au), aR \\cos(v+au), 1)$\n$Y_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} (R \\cos(v+au), R \\sin(v+au), u) = (-R \\sin(v+au), R \\cos(v+au), 0)$\nThe coefficients are:\n$E_Y = \\langle Y_u, Y_u \\rangle = (-aR \\sin(v+au))^{2} + (aR \\cos(v+au))^{2} + 1^{2} = a^{2}R^{2}(\\sin^{2}(v+au) + \\cos^{2}(v+au)) + 1 = a^{2}R^{2} + 1$\n$F_Y = \\langle Y_u, Y_v \\rangle = (-aR \\sin(v+au))(-R \\sin(v+au)) + (aR \\cos(v+au))(R \\cos(v+au)) + 1 \\cdot 0 = aR^{2}(\\sin^{2}(v+au) + \\cos^{2}(v+au)) = aR^{2}$\n$G_Y = \\langle Y_v, Y_v \\rangle = (-R \\sin(v+au))^{2} + (R \\cos(v+au))^{2} + 0^{2} = R^{2}(\\sin^{2}(v+au) + \\cos^{2}(v+au)) = R^{2}$\nThe first fundamental form for $Y$ is $ds_Y^2 = (a^{2}R^{2} + 1) du^{2} + 2aR^{2} du dv + R^{2} dv^{2}$.\n\nPart 4: Argument for isometry without congruence.\nTwo parametrizations are isometric if there exists a smooth reparametrization of the domain (a diffeomorphism) that transforms one first fundamental form into the other. This means they define the same intrinsic geometry.\nLet us define a change of coordinates from a new system $(u', v')$ to the $(u,v)$ system of $X$:\nLet $u' = u$ and $v' = v+au$. This is a diffeomorphism $\\psi: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by $\\psi(u,v) = (u,v+au)$. Its inverse is $\\psi^{-1}(u',v')=(u', v'-au')$.\nNow, consider the composition $X \\circ \\psi$:\n$X(\\psi(u,v)) = X(u, v+au) = (R \\cos(v+au), R \\sin(v+au), u)$\nThis is precisely the parametrization $Y(u,v)$. Since $Y = X \\circ \\psi$, $Y$ is a reparametrization of $X$. By definition, a reparametrization preserves the intrinsic geometry, so the parametrizations $X$ and $Y$ are isometric. The fact that their induced metrics are related by the Jacobian of the reparametrization confirms this. The metric tensor for $X$ is $g_X = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & R^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$. The Jacobian of $\\psi(u,v)=(u,v+au)$ is $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ a & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The transformed metric tensor is $g_Y = J^{T} g_X J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & R^{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ a & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+a^{2}R^{2} & aR^{2} \\\\ aR^{2} & R^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$, which matches the coefficients $(E_Y, F_Y, G_Y)$ computed directly.\n\nTwo parametrizations $X$ and $Y$ are congruent if there exists a single rigid motion (isometry of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$) $T(\\mathbf{p}) = A\\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{b}$, where $A$ is an orthogonal matrix and $\\mathbf{b}$ is a constant vector, such that $Y(u,v) = T(X(u,v))$ for all $(u,v) \\in U$.\nA rigid motion maps straight lines to straight lines. Let us examine the images of the coordinate lines in the parameter domain $U$.\nFor the parametrization $X$, the $u$-parameter curves (where $v=v_0$ is constant) are given by $c(u) = X(u,v_0) = (R \\cos(v_0), R \\sin(v_0), u)$. These are vertical straight lines on the cylinder's surface.\nFor the parametrization $Y$, the $u$-parameter curves (where $v=v_0$ is constant) are given by $h(u) = Y(u,v_0) = (R \\cos(v_0+au), R \\sin(v_0+au), u)$. These curves are helices winding around the cylinder. Since $a \\neq 0$, these helices are not straight lines.\nBecause the parametrization $X$ maps the grid of $u$-lines to a family of straight lines, while the parametrization $Y$ maps the same grid to a family of helices, there can be no rigid motion $T$ that transforms the image of $X$ pointwise into the image of $Y$. If such a $T$ existed, it would have to map the straight lines generated by $X$ to the helices generated by $Y$, which is impossible. Therefore, the parametrizations are not congruent. This highlights the distinction between intrinsic properties (isometry), which are independent of the embedding in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, and extrinsic properties (congruence), which depend on the shape in the ambient space.\n\nPart 5: Computation of the infinitesimal area factor.\nThe infinitesimal area factor is given by the expression $\\sqrt{EG - F^{2}}$. We compute this for both parametrizations.\nFor $X$:\n$\\sqrt{E_X G_X - F_X^{2}} = \\sqrt{1 \\cdot R^{2} - 0^{2}} = \\sqrt{R^{2}} = R$ (since $R>0$).\n\nFor $Y$:\n$\\sqrt{E_Y G_Y - F_Y^{2}} = \\sqrt{(a^{2}R^{2} + 1)R^{2} - (aR^{2})^{2}} = \\sqrt{a^{2}R^{4} + R^{2} - a^{2}R^{4}} = \\sqrt{R^{2}} = R$.\n\nThe value of the area factor is indeed common to both parametrizations and is equal to $R$. This is consistent with the fact that they are isometric via a reparametrization with a Jacobian determinant of $1$. The area element $dA = \\sqrt{EG-F^2} du dv = R du dv$ is the same for both coordinate systems.\nThe final closed-form analytic expression for the common value of the infinitesimal area factor $\\sqrt{EG-F^2}$ is simply $R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{R}$$", "id": "3070676"}, {"introduction": "A key principle in geometry is that fundamental properties should not depend on the coordinates we choose.
