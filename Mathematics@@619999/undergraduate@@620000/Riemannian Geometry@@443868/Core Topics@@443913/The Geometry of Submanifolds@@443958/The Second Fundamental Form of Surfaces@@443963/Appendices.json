The second fundamental form evaluated on this vector is:\n$$ II_0(\\mathbf{v}) = L(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}x)^2 + 2M(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}x)(\\mathrm{d}y) + N(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}y)^2 $$\nSubstituting the coefficients we found:\n$$ II_0(\\mathbf{v}) = f_{xx}(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}x)^2 + 2f_{xy}(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}x)(\\mathrm{d}y) + f_{yy}(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}y)^2 $$\nAsymptotic directions are the directions of nonzero tangent vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ for which the normal curvature is zero, which is equivalent to $II_0(\\mathbf{v}) = 0$. Thus, we must solve the equation:\n$$ f_{xx}(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}x)^2 + 2f_{xy}(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}x)(\\mathrm{d}y) + f_{yy}(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}y)^2 = 0 $$\nThe problem asks to parametrize the tangent direction by its slope $m = \\mathrm{d}y/\\mathrm{d}x$ in the $(x,y)$-plane. This assumes we are seeking directions for which $\\mathrm{d}x \\neq 0$. If $\\mathrm{d}x = 0$, the equation becomes $f_{yy}(0,0)(\\mathrm{d}y)^2 = 0$. For a nonzero direction, $\\mathrm{d}y \\neq 0$, which would require $f_{yy}(0,0) = 0$. However, the problem provides the explicit assumption that $f_{yy}(0,0) \\neq 0$ for this final calculation, so we can safely assume $\\mathrm{d}x \\neq 0$ and divide the equation by $(\\mathrm{d}x)^2$:\n$$ f_{xx}(0,0) + 2f_{xy}(0,0)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} + f_{yy}(0,0)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)^2 = 0 $$\nSubstituting $m = \\mathrm{d}y/\\mathrm{d}x$, we obtain a quadratic equation for $m$:\n$$ f_{yy}(0,0) m^2 + 2f_{xy}(0,0) m + f_{xx}(0,0) = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $am^2+bm+c=0$ with coefficients $a = f_{yy}(0,0)$, $b = 2f_{xy}(0,0)$, and $c = f_{xx}(0,0)$. We solve for $m$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ m = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{-2f_{xy}(0,0) \\pm \\sqrt{(2f_{xy}(0,0))^2 - 4f_{yy}(0,0)f_{xx}(0,0)}}{2f_{yy}(0,0)} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{-2f_{xy}(0,0) \\pm \\sqrt{4f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - 4f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)}}{2f_{yy}(0,0)} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{-2f_{xy}(0,0) \\pm 2\\sqrt{f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)}}{2f_{yy}(0,0)} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{-f_{xy}(0,0) \\pm \\sqrt{f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)}}{f_{yy}(0,0)} $$\nThe problem states that the Hessian determinant, $f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0) - f_{xy}(0,0)^2$, is negative. This implies that the term under the square root, $f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)$, is a positive quantity, which guarantees two distinct real solutions for $m$. This is consistent with the fact that a hyperbolic point (saddle point) has two real, distinct asymptotic directions. The assumption $f_{yy}(0,0) \\neq 0$ ensures the denominator is non-zero.\n\nThe two values for the slope $m$ corresponding to the asymptotic directions are:\n$$ m_1 = \\frac{-f_{xy}(0,0) + \\sqrt{f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)}}{f_{yy}(0,0)} $$\n$$ m_2 = \\frac{-f_{xy}(0,0) - \\sqrt{f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)}}{f_{yy}(0,0)} $$\nThese are the required values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{-f_{xy}(0,0) + \\sqrt{f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)}}{f_{yy}(0,0)} & \\frac{-f_{xy}(0,0) - \\sqrt{f_{xy}(0,0)^2 - f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)}}{f_{yy}(0,0)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3077411"}]}
