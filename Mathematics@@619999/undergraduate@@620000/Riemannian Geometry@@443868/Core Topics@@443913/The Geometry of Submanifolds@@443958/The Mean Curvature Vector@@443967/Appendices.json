No rounding is required, and no units are involved.", "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard exercise in the differential geometry of submanifolds. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must derive a general expression for the mean curvature vector $H(s)$ of an arc-length parameterized curve $\\gamma(s)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Second, we must apply this result to a specific curve, a circle of radius $R$.\n\nLet $M = \\gamma(I)$ be a smooth $1$-dimensional Riemannian submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, where the curve $\\gamma: I \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is parameterized by arc length $s$. The condition for arc-length parameterization is that the magnitude of the tangent vector is unity, i.e., $|\\gamma'(s)| = 1$ for all $s \\in I$. Here, $\\gamma'(s) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{ds}$.\n\nLet $p = \\gamma(s)$ be a point on the curve. The tangent space to $M$ at $p$, denoted $T_pM$, is the $1$-dimensional vector space spanned by the tangent vector $\\gamma'(s)$. The normal space, $N_pM$, is the $(n-1)$-dimensional orthogonal complement of $T_pM$ in $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe second fundamental form, $B$, is a vector-valued symmetric bilinear form defined on the tangent space, $B_p: T_pM \\times T_pM \\to N_pM$. It is defined by the Gauss formula for any two vector fields $X, Y$ tangent to $M$:\n$$\n\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_X Y = (\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_X Y)^T + (\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_X Y)^N = \\nabla^M_X Y + B(X, Y)\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^n}$ is the Levi-Civita connection on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (which corresponds to the standard directional derivative), and $\\nabla^M$ is the induced Levi-Civita connection on the submanifold $M$. The term $\\nabla^M_X Y$ is the tangential component of $\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_X Y$, and $B(X, Y)$ is its normal component.\n\nThe mean curvature vector $H$ at a point $p \\in M$ is defined as the trace of the second fundamental form. For a basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_k\\}$ of $T_pM$ that is orthonormal with respect to the induced metric, the mean curvature vector is:\n$$\nH_p = \\sum_{i=1}^k B_p(e_i, e_i)\n$$\nFor our curve, the dimension is $k=1$. Since the curve is parameterized by arc length, the vector $e_1 = \\gamma'(s)$ forms an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}M$. Applying the definition of the mean curvature vector, we have:\n$$\nH(s) = B(\\gamma'(s), \\gamma'(s))\n$$\nFrom the Gauss formula, $B(\\gamma'(s), \\gamma'(s))$ is the normal component of the vector field $\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_{\\gamma'(s)} \\gamma'$. In the flat ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the covariant derivative of a vector field along a curve is simply the ordinary derivative of its components with respect to the curve parameter. Therefore,\n$$\n\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_{\\gamma'(s)} \\gamma'(s) = \\frac{d}{ds}(\\gamma'(s)) = \\gamma''(s)\n$$\nThus, the mean curvature vector $H(s)$ is the projection of the acceleration vector $\\gamma''(s)$ onto the normal space $N_{\\gamma(s)}M$. Let's denote this projection by $(\\gamma''(s))^N$. So, $H(s) = (\\gamma''(s))^N$.\n\nTo determine this projection, we examine the component of $\\gamma''(s)$ in the tangent direction. The tangent space is spanned by $\\gamma'(s)$. The tangential component of $\\gamma''(s)$ would be $\\langle \\gamma''(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle \\gamma'(s)$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the standard Euclidean inner product. Since the curve is parameterized by arc length, we have $\\langle \\gamma'(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle = |\\gamma'(s)|^2 = 1$. Differentiating this equation with respect to $s$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{ds} \\langle \\gamma'(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle = \\frac{d}{ds}(1) = 0\n$$\nApplying the product rule for derivatives of inner products:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma''(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle + \\langle \\gamma'(s), \\gamma''(s) \\rangle = 2\\langle \\gamma''(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis implies $\\langle \\gamma''(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle = 0$. This result shows that the acceleration vector $\\gamma''(s)$ is orthogonal to the tangent vector $\\gamma'(s)$. Therefore, $\\gamma''(s)$ has no tangential component; it lies entirely within the normal space $N_{\\gamma(s)}M$.\nConsequently, the projection of $\\gamma''(s)$ onto the normal space is the vector $\\gamma''(s)$ itself:\n$$\nH(s) = (\\gamma''(s))^N = \\gamma''(s)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation. For any curve parameterized by arc length in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the mean curvature vector is equal to its acceleration vector.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the problem. We are given the parameterization of a circle of radius $R0$ in the plane embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$\n\\gamma(s)=\\big(R\\cos(s/R),\\,R\\sin(s/R),\\,0,\\,\\dots,\\,0\\big)\n$$\nFirst, we find the first and second derivatives with respect to the parameter $s$. The first derivative (tangent vector) is:\n$$\n\\gamma'(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\big(R\\cos(s/R),\\,R\\sin(s/R),\\,0,\\,\\dots,\\,0\\big) = \\big(-\\sin(s/R),\\,\\cos(s/R),\\,0,\\,\\dots,\\,0\\big)\n$$\nWe verify that this is an arc-length parameterization by computing the magnitude of $\\gamma'(s)$:\n$$\n|\\gamma'(s)| = \\sqrt{(-\\sin(s/R))^2 + (\\cos(s/R))^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2(s/R) + \\cos^2(s/R)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n$$\nSince the parameterization is by arc length, we can use our derived result $H(s) = \\gamma''(s)$. We compute the second derivative:\n$$\n\\gamma''(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\big(-\\sin(s/R),\\,\\cos(s/R),\\,0,\\,\\dots,\\,0\\big) = \\big(-\\frac{1}{R}\\cos(s/R),\\,-\\frac{1}{R}\\sin(s/R),\\,0,\\,\\dots,\\,0\\big)\n$$\nThus, the mean curvature vector is:\n$$\nH(s) = \\big(-\\frac{1}{R}\\cos(s/R),\\,-\\frac{1}{R}\\sin(s/R),\\,0,\\,\\dots,\\,0\\big)\n$$\nThe problem asks for this expression in terms of $\\gamma(s)$ and $R$. We can factor out $-\\frac{1}{R^2}$ from the expression for $H(s)$:\n$$\nH(s) = -\\frac{1}{R^2} \\big(R\\cos(s/R),\\,R\\sin(s/R),\\,0,\\,\\dots,\\,0\\big)\n$$\nRecognizing that the vector part is the original position vector $\\gamma(s)$, we arrive at the final expression:\n$$\nH(s) = -\\frac{1}{R^2}\\gamma(s)\n$$\nThis vector points from the location $\\gamma(s)$ on the circle towards the origin, which is the center of the circle, and its magnitude is $|H(s)| = |-\\frac{1}{R^2}| |\\gamma(s)| = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\cdot R = \\frac{1}{R}$. This magnitude is the scalar mean curvature of the circle, which is consistent with the well-known curvature $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{R}$ for a circle of radius $R$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{R^2}\\gamma(s)}\n$$", "id": "3074436"}, {"introduction": "Having explored curves, we now step up a dimension to surfaces.
