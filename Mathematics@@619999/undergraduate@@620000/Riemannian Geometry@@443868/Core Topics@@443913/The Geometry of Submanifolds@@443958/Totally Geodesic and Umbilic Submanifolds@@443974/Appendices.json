The induced Riemannian metric on $S^n(r)$ is the restriction of the Euclidean inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ to the tangent spaces of the sphere. The outward pointing unit normal vector field is given by $\\nu(x) = x/r$.\n\nA vector $X_x$ is tangent to $S^n(r)$ at a point $x$ if it is orthogonal to the position vector $x$. This follows from differentiating the relation $\\langle \\gamma(t), \\gamma(t) \\rangle = r^2$ for any curve $\\gamma(t) \\subset S^n(r)$ with $\\gamma(0) = x$ and $\\gamma'(0) = X_x$, which yields $2\\langle \\gamma'(0), \\gamma(0) \\rangle = 0$, or $\\langle X_x, x \\rangle = 0$.

The problem provides the definition $S(X) = \\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}_{X} \\nu$ for any vector field $X$ tangent to $S^n(r)$. Here, $\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}$ is the standard Levi-Civita connection on the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In Cartesian coordinates, this connection is simply the directional derivative of the components of the vector field. Let $x \\in S^n(r)$ and let $X_x \\in T_x S^n(r)$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a curve in $S^n(r)$ such that $\\gamma(0) = x$ and $\\gamma'(0) = X_x$.

Our result shows that $S_x(X_x) = \\frac{1}{r}X_x$, which is a scalar multiple of the input tangent vector, confirming it maps $T_xS^n(r)$ to itself.\n\nA hypersurface is defined as totally umbilic if, at each point, its shape operator is a multiple of the identity endomorphism. In our case, for any point $x \\in S^n(r)$, the shape operator is $S_x = \\frac{1}{r} \\text{Id}_{T_x S^n(r)}$, where $\\text{Id}$ is the identity map on the tangent space. Since the factor $\\frac{1}{r}$ is constant over the entire sphere, $S^n(r)$ is a totally umbilic hypersurface. This verifies the assertion in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we compute the mean curvature vector $H$. The problem defines it as $H = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} h(e_{i},e_{i})\\right)\\nu$, where $\\{e_{1}, \\dots, e_{n}\\}$ is any local orthonormal tangent frame, and $h$ is the second fundamental form. The second fundamental form is defined by $h(X,Y) = \\langle S(X), Y \\rangle$ for tangent vector fields $X, Y$.\n\nUsing our derived expression for the shape operator, we find the second fundamental form of the sphere:\n$$\nh(X,Y) = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{r}X, Y \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{r} \\langle X, Y \\rangle\n$$\nNote that $\\langle X, Y \\rangle$ is the induced Riemannian metric $g(X,Y)$ on the sphere. Thus, $h = \\frac{1}{r}g$.\n\nNow, let $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ be a local orthonormal frame for the tangent space at a point $x \\in S^n(r)$. By definition of an orthonormal frame, $\\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Let $\\gamma : [0, r] \\to S^n$ be the unique unit-speed radial geodesic from the center $p$ to $q$, so that $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma(r) = q$. The outward-pointing unit normal vector field $\\nu$ to $\\Sigma_r$ at the point $q$ is given by the tangent vector to this geodesic at $t=r$. Thus, $\\nu_q = \\dot{\\gamma}(r)$. The tangent space $T_q \\Sigma_r$ consists of all vectors in $T_q S^n$ that are orthogonal to $\\nu_q$.\n\nWe wish to compute the second fundamental form $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = g(A X, Y)$, where $A(X) = -(\\nabla_X \\nu)^\\top$ for any tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_q \\Sigma_r$. The key is to compute the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X \\nu$. We can achieve this by relating $\\nabla_X \\nu$ to a Jacobi field along $\\gamma$.\n\nLet $X \\in T_q \\Sigma_r$. We construct a variation through geodesics. Consider a smooth curve $\\alpha(s)$ in $\\Sigma_r$ for $s \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ such that $\\alpha(0) = q$ and $\\dot{\\alpha}(0) = X$. For each $s$, let $\\gamma_s(t)$ be the unique unit-speed geodesic from $p$ to $\\alpha(s)$. This defines a variation $\\sigma(s,t) = \\gamma_s(t)$ such that:\n1.  $\\sigma(s,0) = p$ for all $s$.\n2.  $\\sigma(0,t) = \\gamma(t)$.\n3.  $\\sigma(s,r) = \\alpha(s)$.\n\nThe vector field $J(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial s}|_{s=0}$ along $\\gamma(t)$ is a Jacobi field. Let's determine its properties.\n-   From property 1, $J(0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}|_{s=0} \\sigma(s,0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}|_{s=0} p = 0$.\n-   From property 3, $J(r) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}|_{s=0} \\sigma(s,r) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}|_{s=0} \\alpha(s) = \\dot{\\alpha}(0) = X$.\n\nThe vector $X$ is in $T_q \\Sigma_r$, so it is orthogonal to the normal $\\nu_q = \\dot{\\gamma}(r)$. That is, $g(J(r), \\dot{\\gamma}(r)) = 0$. Since parallel transport along a geodesic preserves the inner product, and both $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ are solutions to second-order ODEs (Jacobi and geodesic equations), the orthogonality is maintained for all $t$. Thus, $g(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,r]$.\n\nThe problem states that any such Jacobi field $J(t)$ orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ satisfies $J''(t) + J(t) = 0$ and, for initial conditions $J(0)=0$ and $J'(0) = w$, has the unique solution $J(t) = \\sin(t) P_t(w)$, where $P_t$ is parallel transport along $\\gamma$. Our Jacobi field satisfies $J(0)=0$. Let's denote its initial derivative as $J'(0) = w$. The solution is then $J(t) = \\sin(t) P_t(w)$.\nUsing the condition at $t=r$, we have $X = J(r) = \\sin(r) P_r(w)$.

Since $X \\in T_q \\Sigma_r$, the resulting vector $\\cot(r) X$ is also tangent to $\\Sigma_r$. Therefore, its tangential projection is itself: $(\\nabla_X \\nu)^\\top = \\cot(r) X$.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, the shape operator is $A(X) = -(\\nabla_X \\nu)^\\top$.\n$$ A(X) = -\\cot(r) X $$\nThe second fundamental form is $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = g(A X, Y)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = g(-\\cot(r) X, Y) = -\\cot(r) g(X,Y) $$\n\n### Step 3: Analysis and Computation of $\\lambda(r)$\n\nA submanifold is defined as **umbilic** if its second fundamental form is proportional to its first fundamental form (the induced metric). Our result shows that $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = \\lambda(r) g(X,Y)$ for all $X, Y \\in T\\Sigma_r$, with the proportionality factor $\\lambda(r) = -\\cot(r)$. Therefore, the geodesic sphere $\\Sigma_r$ is umbilic at every point.\n\nA submanifold is defined as **totally geodesic** if its second fundamental form is identically zero. This would mean that any geodesic of the submanifold is also a geodesic of the ambient manifold. For $\\Sigma_r$ to be totally geodesic, we must have $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y)=0$ for all $X,Y$. This requires $\\lambda(r) = -\\cot(r) = 0$.\nThe equation $\\cot(r) = 0$ has solutions $r = (k + \\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ for integer $k$. In the specified range $0 < r < \\pi$, the only solution is $r = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. For the range $0 < r < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\cot(r)$ is strictly positive, hence $\\lambda(r) \\neq 0$. Consequently, for $0 < r < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the geodesic sphere $\\Sigma_r$ is umbilic but **not** totally geodesic.\n\nThe problem defines the proportionality factor $\\lambda(r)$ via the relation $\\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = \\lambda(r)\\,g(X,Y)$.
