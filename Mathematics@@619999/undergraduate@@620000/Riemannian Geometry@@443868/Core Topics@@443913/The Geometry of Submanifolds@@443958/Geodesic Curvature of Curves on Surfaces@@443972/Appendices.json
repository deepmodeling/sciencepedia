We will first compute this using the extrinsic geometry of the embedding of $S^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and then relate the result to intrinsic calculations on the sphere.\n\nFirst, we find a suitable parametrization for the curve $\\gamma$. The curve lies on the unit sphere defined by $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$ and on the plane $z=c$. Substituting $z=c$ into the sphere equation gives $x^2+y^2 = 1-c^2$. This describes a circle in the plane $z=c$ centered at $(0,0,c)$ with radius $r = \\sqrt{1-c^2}$. The condition $|c|<1$ ensures that $r$ is a positive real number.\n\nTo compute curvature properties, we need an arc-length parametrization of $\\gamma$. Let us first parametrize $\\gamma$ by an angle $t$, which corresponds to the longitude or azimuthal angle. The orientation is specified to be in the direction of increasing longitude.\nA parametrization is given by $\\alpha(t) = (\\sqrt{1-c^2}\\cos(t), \\sqrt{1-c^2}\\sin(t), c)$.\nTo reparametrize by arc length $s$, we compute the speed:\n$$\n\\dot{\\alpha}(t) = \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = (-\\sqrt{1-c^2}\\sin(t), \\sqrt{1-c^2}\\cos(t), 0)\n$$\nThe magnitude of this vector is the speed:\n$$\n\\|\\dot{\\alpha}(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(-\\sqrt{1-c^2}\\sin(t))^2 + (\\sqrt{1-c^2}\\cos(t))^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{(1-c^2)(\\sin^2(t)+\\cos^2(t))} = \\sqrt{1-c^2}\n$$\nSince the speed is constant, the arc length $s$ is $s(t) = t\\sqrt{1-c^2}$.

This is given by the formula $\\ddot{\\gamma} = \\kappa_n N + k_g (N \\times T)$, where $N$ is the surface unit normal, $\\kappa_n$ is the normal curvature, and $k_g$ is the signed geodesic curvature. Taking the magnitude squared of this orthogonal decomposition gives $\\kappa^2 = \\kappa_n^2 + k_g^2$. We can compute the geodesic curvature magnitude $k_g$ using this relation if we find $\\kappa_n$.\n\nThe normal curvature is given by $\\kappa_n = \\ddot{\\gamma}(s) \\cdot N(\\gamma(s))$. The problem states that the surface normal on $S^2$ is the outward one, $N(p)=p$ for any point $p \\in S^2$.\nThus, at a point $\\gamma(s)$ on the curve, the normal is $N(\\gamma(s)) = \\gamma(s) = (r\\cos(s/r), r\\sin(s/r), c)$.\nNow we compute the dot product:\n$$\n\\kappa_n = \\ddot{\\gamma}(s) \\cdot \\gamma(s) = (-\\frac{1}{r}\\cos(s/r), -\\frac{1}{r}\\sin(s/r), 0) \\cdot (r\\cos(s/r), r\\sin(s/r), c)\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa_n = (-\\frac{1}{r})(r)\\cos^2(s/r) + (-\\frac{1}{r})(r)\\sin^2(s/r) + 0 \\cdot c = -\\cos^2(s/r) - \\sin^2(s/r) = -1\n$$\nThis result, $\\kappa_n=-1$, is expected for any curve on a unit sphere, as the shape operator with respect to the outward normal is $-I$, so $\\kappa_n = \\langle S(T), T \\rangle = \\langle -T, T \\rangle = -\\|T\\|^2 = -1$.\n\nNow we can compute the magnitude of the geodesic curvature, $k_g$:\n$$\nk_g^2 = \\kappa^2 - \\kappa_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-c^2}}\\right)^2 - (-1)^2 = \\frac{1}{1-c^2} - 1 = \\frac{1 - (1-c^2)}{1-c^2} = \\frac{c^2}{1-c^2}\n$$\nTaking the square root, the magnitude is:\n$$\nk_g = \\sqrt{\\frac{c^2}{1-c^2}} = \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{1-c^2}}\n$$\nThis is the geodesic curvature magnitude as a function of $c$.\n\nNext, we express this result in terms of colatitude $\\theta_0 \\in (0,\\pi)$ and geographic latitude $\\lambda \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nFor a point on the unit sphere, the $z$-coordinate is $z=\\cos\\theta_0$.

The magnitude of the geodesic curvature becomes:\n$$\nk_g = \\frac{|\\cos\\theta_0|}{\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2\\theta_0}} = \\frac{|\\cos\\theta_0|}{\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\theta_0}} = \\frac{|\\cos\\theta_0|}{|\\sin\\theta_0|}\n$$\nSince $\\theta_0 \\in (0,\\pi)$, $\\sin\\theta_0 > 0$, so $|\\sin\\theta_0| = \\sin\\theta_0$. Therefore, $k_g = \\frac{|\\cos\\theta_0|}{\\sin\\theta_0} = |\\cot\\theta_0|$.\n\nFor geographic latitude $\\lambda$, the $z$-coordinate is $z=\\sin\\lambda$. Thus, $c=\\sin\\lambda$. The magnitude of the geodesic curvature becomes:\n$$\nk_g = \\frac{|\\sin\\lambda|}{\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2\\lambda}} = \\frac{|\\sin\\lambda|}{\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\lambda}} = \\frac{|\\sin\\lambda|}{|\\cos\\lambda|}\n$$\nSince $\\lambda \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $\\cos\\lambda > 0$, so $|\\cos\\lambda| = \\cos\\lambda$. Therefore, $k_g = \\frac{|\\sin\\lambda|}{\\cos\\lambda} = |\\tan\\lambda|$.\n\nFinally, we briefly explain why this agrees with the intrinsic computation for parallels on the sphere. The Riemannian metric on the unit sphere in standard spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$ (where $\\theta$ is colatitude) is $ds^2 = d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$. The geodesic curvature of a curve is the magnitude of the tangential component of its acceleration vector, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}$. For a parallel curve $\\theta=\\theta_0$, parametrized by arc length $s$, the unit tangent vector is $T = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}$. The components of the covariant acceleration vector $\\nabla_T T$ can be computed using Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ of the metric. The only non-zero Christoffel symbols relevant for the acceleration of a parallel are $\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$ and $\\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\theta\\phi} = \\cot\\theta$. The acceleration vector is found to be $\\nabla_T T = -\\cot\\theta_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$. Since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$ is a unit vector (as $g_{\\theta\\theta}=1$), the magnitude of the acceleration vector is $|\\!-\\cot\\theta_0| = |\\cot\\theta_0|$.

Using the chain rule again:\n$$\\gamma''(s) = \\frac{dT}{du}\\frac{du}{ds} = \\frac{d}{du}(-\\sin u, \\cos u, 0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta_0}$$\n$$\\gamma''(s) = (-\\cos u, -\\sin u, 0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta_0} = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta_0}(-\\cos u, -\\sin u, 0)$$\nThis vector is independent of the direction of traversal along the curve's path. It is given by $\\kappa n$, where $\\kappa=1/\\sin\\theta_0$ is the curvature and $n=(-\\cos u, -\\sin u, 0)$ is the principal normal of the circle in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**2. Orientation Vectors**\n\n- **Surface Normal $N_S$:** The surface is the unit sphere. The position vector $\\gamma(u)$ has unit length and is orthogonal to the surface.\n    - **Outward normal:** $N_{out} = \\gamma(u) = (\\sin\\theta_0\\cos u, \\sin\\theta_0\\sin u, \\cos\\theta_0)$.\n    - **Inward normal:** $N_{in} = -\\gamma(u) = -(\\sin\\theta_0\\cos u, \\sin\\theta_0\\sin u, \\cos\\theta_0)$.\n\n- **Curve Tangent $T$:**\n    - **Eastward orientation:** $T_{east} = T(u) = (-\\sin u, \\cos u, 0)$.\n    - **Westward orientation:** $T_{west} = -T_{east} = (\\sin u, -\\cos u, 0)$.\n\n**3. Computation of Signed Geodesic Curvature $k_g$**\n\nWe now compute $k_g$ for each of the four specified cases.\n\n**Case 1: Outward surface normal and eastward curve orientation**\n$N_S = N_{out}$, $T = T_{east}$.\n$$k_{g,1} = \\det(N_{out}, T_{east}, \\gamma''(s))$$\nThe matrix for the determinant is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta_0\\cos u & -\\sin u & -\\frac{\\cos u}{\\sin\\theta_0} \\\\ \\sin\\theta_0\\sin u & \\cos u & -\\frac{\\sin u}{\\sin\\theta_0} \\\\ \\cos\\theta_0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe expand the determinant along the third row:\n$$k_{g,1} = \\cos\\theta_0 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin u & -\\frac{\\cos u}{\\sin\\theta_0} \\\\ \\cos u & -\\frac{\\sin u}{\\sin\\theta_0} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$k_{g,1} = \\cos\\theta_0 \\left( (-\\sin u)\\left(-\\frac{\\sin u}{\\sin\\theta_0}\\right) - (\\cos u)\\left(-\\frac{\\cos u}{\\sin\\theta_0}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$k_{g,1} = \\cos\\theta_0 \\left( \\frac{\\sin^2 u}{\\sin\\theta_0} + \\frac{\\cos^2 u}{\\sin\\theta_0} \\right) = \\cos\\theta_0 \\left( \\frac{\\sin^2 u + \\cos^2 u}{\\sin\\theta_0} \\right) = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_0}{\\sin\\theta_0}$$\n$$k_{g,1} = \\cot\\theta_0$$\n\n**Case 2: Outward surface normal and westward curve orientation**\n$N_S = N_{out}$, $T = T_{west} = -T_{east}$.\nThe determinant is linear in each column. Changing the sign of the second vector $T$ negates the determinant:\n$$k_{g,2} = \\det(N_{out}, -T_{east}, \\gamma''(s)) = -\\det(N_{out}, T_{east}, \\gamma''(s)) = -k_{g,1}$$\n$$k_{g,2} = -\\cot\\theta_0$$\n\n**Case 3: Inward surface normal and eastward curve orientation**\n$N_S = N_{in} = -N_{out}$, $T = T_{east}$.\nChanging the sign of the first vector $N_S$ also negates the determinant:\n$$k_{g,3} = \\det(-N_{out}, T_{east}, \\gamma''(s)) = -\\det(N_{out}, T_{east}, \\gamma''(s)) = -k_{g,1}$$\n$$k_{g,3} = -\\cot\\theta_0$$\n\n**Case 4: Inward surface normal and westward curve orientation**\n$N_S = N_{in} = -N_{out}$, $T = T_{west} = -T_{east}$.\nChanging the signs of two vectors results in a double sign change, leaving the determinant value unchanged:\n$$k_{g,4} = \\det(-N_{out}, -T_{east}, \\gamma''(s)) = (-1)(-1)\\det(N_{out}, T_{east}, \\gamma''(s)) = k_{g,1}$$\n$$k_{g,4} = \\cot\\theta_0$$\n\n**Summary of Results**\nThe signed geodesic curvatures for the four cases are:\n1. $k_{g,1} = \\cot\\theta_0$\n2. $k_{g,2} = -\\cot\\theta_0$\n3. $k_{g,3} = -\\cot\\theta_0$\n4. $k_{g,4} = \\cot\\theta_0$\n\nThese results can be assembled into a $1 \\times 4$ row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\cot\\theta_0 & -\\cot\\theta_0 & -\\cot\\theta_0 & \\cot\\theta_0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3047560"}]}
