We begin from the foundational definitions as requested.\n\nThe space is $\\mathbb{R}^3$ equipped with its standard Riemannian metric, which is the Euclidean dot product. At any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the metric $g_p$ acts on tangent vectors $v, w \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ as $g_p(v, w) = v \\cdot w$.\n\nThe given curve is $\\gamma:[0,\\ln 3]\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, defined by $\\gamma(t)=(\\cosh t,\\sinh t,t)$. This is a smooth curve.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the speed of $\\gamma$ and then compute it. The tangent vector to the curve at a parameter value $t$ is the derivative with respect to $t$, denoted $\\gamma'(t)$. The speed of the curve, which we will denote as $v(t)$, is the magnitude of the tangent vector as measured by the Riemannian metric. It is formally defined as:\n$$v(t) = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t))}$$\nFor the standard Euclidean metric, this simplifies to the standard Euclidean norm of the tangent vector:\n$$v(t) = \\sqrt{\\gamma'(t) \\cdot \\gamma'(t)}$$\n\nNow, we compute the tangent vector for the specific curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cosh t, \\sinh t, t)$:\n$$\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}(\\cosh t), \\frac{d}{dt}(\\sinh t), \\frac{d}{dt}(t)\\right) = (\\sinh t, \\cosh t, 1)$$\n\nNext, we compute the speed $v(t)$ using the dot product:\n$$v(t) = \\sqrt{(\\sinh t)^2 + (\\cosh t)^2 + 1^2}$$\nWe use the fundamental hyperbolic identity $\\cosh^2 t - \\sinh^2 t = 1$, which can be rearranged to $\\cosh^2 t = 1 + \\sinh^2 t$. Substituting this into the expression for the speed squared:\n$$v(t)^2 = \\sinh^2 t + (1 + \\sinh^2 t) + 1 = 2\\sinh^2 t + 2 = 2(1 + \\sinh^2 t) = 2\\cosh^2 t$$\nTaking the square root to find the speed:\n$$v(t) = \\sqrt{2\\cosh^2 t} = \\sqrt{2}|\\cosh t|$$\nSince $\\cosh t \\ge 1$ for all real $t$, it is always positive. Thus, we can drop the absolute value:\n$$v(t) = \\sqrt{2}\\cosh t$$\nSince $v(t) > 0$ for all $t$ in the domain $[0, \\ln 3]$, the curve is regular.\n\nThe second task is to construct the arc-length function $s(t)$. This function measures the length of the curve from the starting point (at parameter $0$) to the point corresponding to parameter $t$. It is defined as the integral of the speed from the start of the interval. The requirement $s(0)=0$ is naturally satisfied by this definition:\n$$s(t) = \\int_0^t v(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\sqrt{2}\\cosh \\tau d\\tau$$\nThe integral of $\\cosh \\tau$ is $\\sinh \\tau$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$s(t) = \\sqrt{2} \\left[\\sinh \\tau\\right]_0^t = \\sqrt{2}(\\sinh t - \\sinh 0) = \\sqrt{2}(\\sinh t - 0)$$\nSo, the arc-length function is:\n$$s(t) = \\sqrt{2}\\sinh t$$\n\nNext, we must invert this function to express $t$ in terms of the arc length $s$:\n$$s = \\sqrt{2}\\sinh t \\implies \\sinh t = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nApplying the inverse hyperbolic sine function to both sides gives $t$ as a function of $s$:\n$$t(s) = \\arcsinh\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can find the arc-length parametrization (or unit-speed reparametrization) $\\widehat{\\gamma}(s)$.

For the second component, $\\sinh(\\arcsinh(u)) = u$. Thus:\n$$\\sinh\\left(\\arcsinh\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nFor the first component, we again use the identity $\\cosh^2 u = 1 + \\sinh^2 u$. Let $u = \\arcsinh\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$. Since $\\cosh u > 0$, we have $\\cosh u = \\sqrt{1 + \\sinh^2 u}$.\n$$\\cosh\\left(\\arcsinh\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) = \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\sinh\\left(\\arcsinh\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right)\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{s^2}{2}}$$\nCombining the components, the arc-length parametrization is:\n$$\\widehat{\\gamma}(s) = \\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{s^2}{2}}, \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\arcsinh\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we determine the exact total length of the curve $\\gamma$ over the interval $[0, \\ln 3]$.

Regularity and Speed**\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$.

To check for regularity on the interval $[0, \\infty)$, we must verify that $\\gamma'(t) \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The third component of the tangent vector is $z'(t) = \\exp(t)$. The exponential function $\\exp(t)$ is strictly positive for all real $t$, so $\\exp(t) > 0$ for $t \\ge 0$. Since at least one component of $\\gamma'(t)$ is never zero, the vector $\\gamma'(t)$ can never be the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, 0)$. Therefore, the curve $\\gamma$ is regular on its entire domain $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe speed of the curve is the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the tangent vector, denoted $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|$. We compute the square of the speed:\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 = (x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2$$\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 = [\\exp(t)(\\cos(t) - \\sin(t))]^2 + [\\exp(t)(\\sin(t) + \\cos(t))]^2 + [\\exp(t)]^2$$\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 = \\exp(2t)(\\cos^2(t) - 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t) + \\sin^2(t)) + \\exp(2t)(\\sin^2(t) + 2\\sin(t)\\cos(t) + \\cos^2(t)) + \\exp(2t)$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$:\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 = \\exp(2t)(1 - 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + \\exp(2t)(1 + 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + \\exp(2t)$$\nFactoring out $\\exp(2t)$:\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 = \\exp(2t) \\big( (1 - 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + (1 + 2\\cos(t)\\sin(t)) + 1 \\big)$$\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 = \\exp(2t) (1 + 1 + 1) = 3\\exp(2t)$$\nThe speed is the square root of this value.

Arc-Length Function and its Inverse**\n\nThe arc-length parameter $s$ is defined as the integral of the speed from the starting point $t=0$. The condition $s(0)=0$ is satisfied by this definition.\n$$s(t) = \\int_0^t \\|\\gamma'(\\tau)\\| \\, d\\tau$$\nSubstituting the expression for the speed:\n$$s(t) = \\int_0^t \\sqrt{3}\\exp(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\sqrt{3} \\left[ \\exp(\\tau) \\right]_0^t = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t) - \\exp(0))$$\n$$s(t) = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t) - 1)$$\nTo prove that $s(t)$ is strictly increasing for $t \\ge 0$, we examine its derivative with respect to $t$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = \\sqrt{3}\\exp(t)$$\nFor all $t \\in [0, \\infty)$, we have $\\exp(t) \\ge 1$, which implies $\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\sqrt{3}\\exp(t) > 0$. Since the derivative is strictly positive, the function $s(t)$ is strictly increasing on its domain.\n\nNext, we find the inverse function $t(s)$ by solving $s = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t) - 1)$ for $t$.\n$$\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\exp(t) - 1$$\n$$\\exp(t) = 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $t$ as a function of $s$:\n$$t(s) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nThe domain of this function is determined by the range of $s(t)$. Since $t \\ge 0$, $\\exp(t) \\ge 1$, which means $\\exp(t) - 1 \\ge 0$. Thus, $s = \\sqrt{3}(\\exp(t)-1) \\ge 0$. For $s \\ge 0$, the argument of the logarithm, $1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$, is always greater than or equal to $1$, so $t(s)$ is well-defined and non-negative.\n\n**3. Arc-Length Reparametrization and Unit-Speed Verification**\n\nThe arc-length reparametrization $\\alpha(s)$ is obtained by composing $\\gamma$ with $t(s)$:\n$$\\alpha(s) = \\gamma(t(s))$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $\\exp(t(s))$ and $t(s)$ into the definition of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\\exp(t(s)) = 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n$$t(s) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nThe components of $\\alpha(s)$ are:\n$$x(s) = \\exp(t(s))\\cos(t(s)) = \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$y(s) = \\exp(t(s))\\sin(t(s)) = \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$z(s) = \\exp(t(s)) = 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThus, the reparametrized curve is:\n$$\\alpha(s) = \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right), \\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right), 1 + \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)$$\n\nTo verify that $\\alpha(s)$ is a unit-speed curve, we must show that $\\|\\alpha'(s)\\| = 1$.
