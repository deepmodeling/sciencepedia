Invariance under horizontal translations:\n    The metric $g$ is invariant under transformations of the form $\\phi_a: (x,y) \\mapsto (\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y}) = (x+a, y)$ for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The invariance condition is that the pullback of the metric, $\\phi_a^*g$, must be equal to the original metric $g$.\n    Let's compute the pullback. The new coordinates are $\\tilde{x} = x+a$ and $\\tilde{y} = y$.

Therefore, we can write $\\lambda(x,y)$ as a function of $y$ only: $\\lambda(x,y) = \\lambda(y)$.\n\n2.  Invariance under positive dilations:\n    The metric $g$ is also invariant under transformations of the form $\\psi_b: (x,y) \\mapsto (\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y}) = (bx, by)$ for any $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $b > 0$.\n    The new coordinates are $\\tilde{x} = bx$ and $\\tilde{y} = by$.

To solve it, we can choose a specific value, for instance $y=1$, which gives $\\lambda(b) \\, b = \\lambda(1)$. Let $C = \\lambda(1)$ be this constant value. Then for any $b>0$, we have $\\lambda(b) = C/b$. Since this holds for any positive real number, we can replace the variable $b$ with $y$, yielding the general form for the function:\n    $$ \\lambda(y) = \\frac{C}{y} $$\n    where $C$ is a positive constant.\n\n3.  Gaussian curvature condition:\n    The Gaussian curvature $K$ of a Riemannian metric given in conformal form $g = e^{2\\sigma(x,y)}(dx^2 + dy^2)$ is given by the formula $K = -e^{-2\\sigma} \\Delta \\sigma$, where $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is the Euclidean Laplacian.\n    In our case, the metric is $g = (\\frac{C}{y})^2 (dx^2 + dy^2)$.

Since $\\sigma$ depends only on $y$, the partial derivative with respect to $x$ is zero: $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial x} = 0$, so $\\frac{\\partial^2\\sigma}{\\partial x^2} = 0$.\n    The partial derivatives with respect to $y$ are:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{y} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial^2\\sigma}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{1}{y^2} $$\n    The Laplacian is $\\Delta \\sigma = \\frac{\\partial^2\\sigma}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\sigma}{\\partial y^2} = 0 + \\frac{1}{y^2} = \\frac{1}{y^2}$.\n    Now we substitute this into the curvature formula:\n    $$ K = -e^{-2\\sigma} \\Delta \\sigma = -(\\lambda(y))^{-2} \\Delta \\sigma = -\\left(\\frac{C}{y}\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\frac{1}{y^2}\\right) = -\\frac{y^2}{C^2} \\frac{1}{y^2} = -\\frac{1}{C^2} $$\n    The problem states that the Gaussian curvature is constant and equal to $-1$. Therefore:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{C^2} = -1 \\implies C^2 = 1 $$\n    Since $C = \\lambda(1)$ must be positive, we conclude that $C=1$.\n    The explicit form of the conformal factor is therefore:\n    $$ \\lambda(x,y) = \\frac{1}{y} $$\n\nNext, we compute the hyperbolic norm of any Euclidean unit tangent vector.\nThe full metric tensor is $g = \\frac{1}{y^2}(dx^2 + dy^2)$.\nLet $p = (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{H}$ be a point.

Taking the square root gives the relationship between the norms:\n$$ \\|v\\|_g = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{y^2}(v_x^2 + v_y^2)} = \\frac{1}{y} \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \\frac{1}{y} \\|v\\|_E $$\nSince $v$ is a Euclidean unit vector, $\\|v\\|_E = 1$. Substituting this into the equation, we find the hyperbolic norm:\n$$ \\|v\\|_g = \\frac{1}{y} $$\nThis result shows that at any point $(x,y)$, the hyperbolic length of any Euclidean unit vector is the same, regardless of its direction, and this length is equal to the reciprocal of the $y$-coordinate of the point.\n\nThe two requested analytic expressions are the conformal factor $\\lambda(x,y)$ and the hyperbolic norm of a Euclidean unit vector at $(x,y)$.\n- Conformal factor: $\\lambda(x,y) = \\frac{1}{y}$\n- Hyperbolic norm: $\\|v\\|_g = \\frac{1}{y}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{y} & \\frac{1}{y} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3059256"}, {"introduction": "Once a metric is defined, the most fundamental task is to measure distance.

In Cartesian coordinates, these correspond to $P_{0}=(0,1)$ and $P_{1}=(0,y)$. Since both points have an $x$-coordinate of $0$, they lie on the positive imaginary axis.\n\n**Part 1: Length of the Vertical Path**\n\nLet us compute the length of the straight vertical path $\\gamma_v$ connecting $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$. We can parameterize this path as $\\gamma_v(\\tau) = (x(\\tau), y(\\tau)) = (0, \\tau)$, where $\\tau$ varies between $1$ and $y$.

Let $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ for $t \\in [a, b]$ be an arbitrary smooth path such that $\\gamma(a)=(0,1)$ and $\\gamma(b)=(0,y)$. Its length is:\n$$L(\\gamma) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\sqrt{(x'(t))^{2}+(y'(t))^{2}}}{y(t)} dt$$\nSince $(x'(t))^{2} \\ge 0$, we have the inequality $\\sqrt{(x'(t))^{2}+(y'(t))^{2}} \\ge \\sqrt{(y'(t))^{2}} = |y'(t)|$. Applying this to the integrand, we get a lower bound for the length:\n$$L(\\gamma) \\ge \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{|y'(t)|}{y(t)} dt$$\nUsing the integral inequality $\\int_{a}^{b} |f(t)| dt \\ge \\left|\\int_{a}^{b} f(t) dt\\right|$, we can further bound this expression:\n$$\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{|y'(t)|}{y(t)} dt \\ge \\left| \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)} dt \\right|$$\nThe integral on the right side can be solved using the substitution $u=y(t)$, so $du=y'(t)dt$.\n$$\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)} dt = \\int_{y(a)}^{y(b)} \\frac{1}{u} du = [\\ln|u|]_{y(a)}^{y(b)} = \\ln(y(b)) - \\ln(y(a))$$\nSince $y(t)>0$ in $\\mathbb{H}$, we can drop the absolute value inside the logarithm.

Since the vertical path $\\gamma_v$ has a length exactly equal to $|\\ln(y)|$, it is a path of minimal length. The hyperbolic distance is this minimal length.\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}}(z_{0},z_{1}) = |\\ln(y)|$$\n\n**Part 3: Verification with the General Formula**\n\nThe general closed-form expression for the hyperbolic distance between two points $z_a, z_b \\in \\mathbb{H}$ is:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}}(z_a, z_b) = \\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{|z_a - z_b|^2}{2 \\operatorname{Im}(z_a) \\operatorname{Im}(z_b)}\\right)$$\nFor our points $z_0=i$ and $z_1=iy$, we have:\n-   $\\operatorname{Im}(z_0) = 1$\n-   $\\operatorname{Im}(z_1) = y$\n-   $|z_0 - z_1|^2 = |i - iy|^2 = |i(1-y)|^2 = |i|^2 |1-y|^2 = (1-y)^2$\n\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{H}}(z_0, z_1) = \\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{(1-y)^2}{2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot y}\\right) = \\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{1 - 2y + y^2}{2y}\\right)$$\n$$= \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{2y + 1 - 2y + y^2}{2y}\\right) = \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{y^2+1}{2y}\\right)$$\nTo verify this equals $|\\ln(y)|$, we can use the identity $u = \\arccosh(v) \\iff v = \\cosh(u)$ for $u \\ge 0$.

By the isometry group of $\\mathbb{D}$, the same conclusion holds starting from any interior point.**\n\nThis argument proceeds in three steps:\n1.  **Path and Length Calculation:** It considers a radial path from the origin $z=0$ towards a point $z=r\\xi$ on a circle of Euclidean radius $r$. Let the path be parameterized by Euclidean distance from the origin, $\\gamma(\\rho)=\\rho\\xi$ for $\\rho \\in [0, r]$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(\\rho)=\\xi$, so its magnitude is $|\\gamma'(\\rho)|=1$. The magnitude of the position vector is $|\\gamma(\\rho)|=|\\rho\\xi|=\\rho$. The hyperbolic length integrand is $\\frac{2|\\gamma'(\\rho)|}{1-|\\gamma(\\rho)|^2} = \\frac{2}{1-\\rho^2}$.\n    The total length is:\n    $$L(r) = \\int_0^r \\frac{2}{1-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$$\n    Using partial fraction decomposition, $\\frac{2}{1-\\rho^2} = \\frac{1}{1-\\rho} + \\frac{1}{1+\\rho}$. The integral becomes:\n    $$L(r) = \\int_0^r \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\rho} + \\frac{1}{1-\\rho}\\right) \\, d\\rho = \\left[\\ln(1+\\rho) - \\ln(1-\\rho)\\right]_0^r = \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\rho}{1-\\rho}\\right)\\right]_0^r$$\n    $$L(r) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+0}{1-0}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\right)$$\n    This calculation is correct.\n2.  **Limit as Boundary is Approached:** The argument then examines the limit as the endpoint of the path approaches the boundary, i.e., as $r \\to 1^{-}$.\n    $$\\lim_{r \\to 1^{-}} L(r) = \\lim_{r \\to 1^{-}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\right)$$\n    As $r \\to 1^{-}$, the numerator approaches $2$ and the denominator approaches $0^{+}$, so the fraction $\\frac{1+r}{1-r}$ diverges to $+\\infty$. Since $\\ln(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$, the limit of the length is $+\\infty$. This shows that the hyperbolic distance from the origin to the boundary is infinite.\n3.  **Generalization by Isometry:** The group of isometries of $(\\mathbb{D}, g_{\\mathbb{D}})$ (Möbius transformations preserving $\\mathbb{D}$) acts transitively on $\\mathbb{D}$. This means for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{D}$, there exists an isometry $\\phi: \\mathbb{D} \\to \\mathbb{D}$ such that $\\phi(0) = p$. Since isometries preserve distances, the hyperbolic distance from $p$ to the boundary is the same as the hyperbolic distance from $\\phi(0)$ to the boundary, which is the same as the distance from $0$ to the boundary (as $\\phi$ maps the boundary to itself). Since the distance from the origin is infinite, it is infinite from any point $p$.\n\nThe argument is logically sound, the calculations are correct, and it relies on established principles of hyperbolic geometry.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because hyperbolic geodesics in $\\mathbb{D}$ are Euclidean circles orthogonal to the unit circle, and orthogonality implies that the Euclidean unit circle is reached in finite Euclidean length, the hyperbolic distance to the boundary must be finite.**\n\nThe first premise, that hyperbolic geodesics in $\\mathbb{D}$ are arcs of Euclidean circles (including diameters as a limiting case) that are orthogonal to the boundary circle $\\{z: |z|=1\\}$, is correct. The second premise, that these paths have finite Euclidean length, is also correct. However, the conclusion \"the hyperbolic distance to the boundary must be finite\" is a non sequitur. The hyperbolic length element $ds_{\\mathbb{D}} = \\frac{2|dz|}{1-|z|^2}$ is not the same as the Euclidean length element $ds_E = |dz|$. The argument incorrectly conflates properties of Euclidean length with hyperbolic length. The entire geometric feature of the model is that the conformal factor $\\frac{2}{1-|z|^2}$ diverges as $|z| \\to 1$, which makes paths of finite Euclidean length have infinite hyperbolic length. The conclusion is not only wrong but follows from fallacious reasoning.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.

Along a vertical ray $\\gamma(y)=x_{0}+iy$ with $y\\downarrow 0$, the hyperbolic length is $L=\\int_{y_{0}}^{0}\\frac{1}{y}\\,dy$, which diverges to $+\\infty$, and since $C$ is an isometry for the hyperbolic metrics, the corresponding boundary in $\\mathbb{D}$ is also at infinite hyperbolic distance.**\n\nThis argument uses the isometry between the upper half-plane model $(\\mathbb{H}, g_{\\mathbb{H}})$ and the Poincaré disk model $(\\mathbb{D}, g_{\\mathbb{D}})$.\n1.  **Isometry:** It correctly states that the Cayley transform provides such an isometry. This isometry maps the boundary of $\\mathbb{H}$ (the real axis $\\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$) to the boundary of $\\mathbb{D}$ (the unit circle).\n2.  **Path Length in $\\mathbb{H}$:** It considers a path approaching the boundary in $\\mathbb{H}$. The boundary is the real axis, where $\\operatorname{Im}(z)=0$. A vertical ray, $\\gamma(y) = x_0 + iy$ for some constant $x_0$, is a geodesic in $\\mathbb{H}$. Let's calculate the length of such a path from a point $z_0 = x_0+iy_0$ (with $y_0>0$) towards the boundary, i.e., as $y \\to 0^{+}$. The parameter is $y$, so $\\gamma'(y) = i$, and $|\\gamma'(y)|=1$. The hyperbolic length element is $\\frac{|\\gamma'(y)|}{\\operatorname{Im}(\\gamma(y))} dy = \\frac{1}{y} dy$. The length from $y=\\epsilon$ to $y=y_0$ is:\n    $$L = \\int_{\\epsilon}^{y_0} \\frac{1}{y} dy = [\\ln y]_{\\epsilon}^{y_0} = \\ln(y_0) - \\ln(\\epsilon)$$\n    As $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$, we have $\\ln(\\epsilon) \\to -\\infty$, so $L \\to +\\infty$. The integral $\\int_{y_0}^0 \\frac{1}{y} dy$ is an improper integral that diverges. Its use here, while slightly informal, correctly captures this divergence to $+\\infty$ for the path length.\n3.  **Conclusion via Isometry:** Since the Cayley transform $C$ is an isometry, it preserves lengths of paths. A path in $\\mathbb{H}$ approaching the boundary has a corresponding image path in $\\mathbb{D}$ approaching the boundary of $\\mathbb{D}$. Since the path in $\\mathbb{H}$ has infinite hyperbolic length, its image in $\\mathbb{D}$ must also have infinite hyperbolic length.\n\nThis argument is a standard and valid method for demonstrating the property in question.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The Poincaré disk $(\\mathbb{D},g_{\\mathbb{D}})$ is geodesically complete by the Hopf–Rinow theorem, and therefore any Cauchy sequence that approaches the Euclidean unit circle must have infinite hyperbolic length; hence the boundary is at infinite hyperbolic distance.**\n\nThis argument invokes the powerful Hopf-Rinow theorem. The premise that $(\\mathbb{D}, g_{\\mathbb{D}})$ is a complete Riemannian manifold (and thus geodesically complete) is correct. However, the reasoning that follows is critically flawed.\nThe statement \"any Cauchy sequence that approaches the Euclidean unit circle\" is a contradiction in terms. By the definition of completeness, any Cauchy sequence $\\{z_n\\}$ in the metric space $(\\mathbb{D}, d_\\mathbb{D})$ must converge to a point *within* $\\mathbb{D}$. A sequence that approaches the Euclidean unit circle does not converge to a point within $\\mathbb{D}$, and therefore it cannot be a Cauchy sequence in the hyperbolic metric.\nFurthermore, the phrase \"must have infinite hyperbolic length\" is a category error. A sequence of points is not a path and does not have a \"length\".\nWhile the completeness of $(\\mathbb{D}, g_{\\mathbb{D}})$ does indeed imply that the boundary is at an infinite distance (as any sequence approaching the boundary must be unbounded in the hyperbolic metric), the argument presented in this option is poorly formulated, containing contradictions and nonsensical statements. It misrepresents the implications of the Hopf-Rinow theorem.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The conformal factor $\\frac{2}{1-|z|^{2}}$ of $g_{\\mathbb{D}}$ is bounded on $\\mathbb{D}$, so integrating it along any path approaching $\\{|z|=1\\}$ gives a finite length; therefore the boundary is at finite hyperbolic distance.**\n\nThis argument's premise is factually incorrect. The conformal factor is $\\lambda(z) = \\frac{2}{1-|z|^2}$. The domain is $\\mathbb{D} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|<1\\}$. We can find points in $\\mathbb{D}$ arbitrarily close to the boundary circle $|z|=1$. For a sequence of points $z_n$ such that $|z_n| \\to 1^{-}$, the denominator $1-|z_n|^2 \\to 0^{+}$. Consequently, the conformal factor $\\lambda(z_n) \\to +\\infty$. The function $\\lambda(z)$ is unbounded on $\\mathbb{D}$.\nSince the premise is false, the entire argument is invalid. The conclusion that the boundary is at a finite distance is also incorrect.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3059227"}]}
