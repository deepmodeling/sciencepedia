The vectors $X$ and $T$ are unit vectors tangent to the $\\mathbb{S}^{2}_{\\rho}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ factors, respectively. The computation must be based on the Koszul formula for the Levi-Civita connection and the definitions of the Riemann curvature tensor and sectional curvature.\n\nFirst, we state the required definitions.\nThe sectional curvature of a $2$-plane spanned by two vectors $U$ and $V$ is defined as\n$$K(U,V) = \\frac{g(R(U,V)V, U)}{g(U,U)g(V,V) - g(U,V)^2}$$\nwhere $R(U,V)W$ is the Riemann curvature tensor, given by\n$$R(U,V)W = \\nabla_U \\nabla_V W - \\nabla_V \\nabla_U W - \\nabla_{[U,V]} W$$\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is uniquely determined by the Koszul formula:\n$$2g(\\nabla_U V, W) = U(g(V,W)) + V(g(U,W)) - W(g(U,V)) + g([U,V],W) - g([U,W],V) - g([V,W],U)$$\nIn our case, the plane is $\\sigma = \\mathrm{span}\\{X, T\\}$. The vector $X$ is tangent to the $\\mathbb{S}^{2}_{\\rho}$ factor, and $T$ is tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor. In a product manifold, tangent vectors to different factors are orthogonal. Therefore, $g(X,T) = 0$. The problem states that $X$ and $T$ are unit vectors, so $g(X,X) = 1$ and $g(T,T) = 1$. The denominator of the sectional curvature formula becomes $g(X,X)g(T,T) - g(X,T)^2 = (1)(1) - 0^2 = 1$.\nThe expression for the sectional curvature simplifies to:\n$$K(\\sigma) = K(X,T) = g(R(X,T)T, X)$$\nTo evaluate this, we first need to compute $R(X,T)T$. We begin by extending the vectors $X$ and $T$ at the point $(p,t)$ to vector fields in a neighborhood. Let $X$ be a vector field that is everywhere tangent to the spherical factor $\\mathbb{S}^2_\\rho$ and whose components depend only on the coordinates of $\\mathbb{S}^2_\\rho$. Let $T$ be the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$, which is everywhere tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor. For such vector fields, which are lifts from the respective factor manifolds, their Lie bracket is zero: $[X,T] = 0$.\n\nWith $[X,T]=0$, the Riemann tensor expression simplifies to $R(X,T)T = \\nabla_X \\nabla_T T - \\nabla_T \\nabla_X T$. We now compute the required covariant derivatives using the Koszul formula. A general property of product manifolds is that the covariant derivative $\\nabla_U V$ is zero if $U$ and $V$ are vector fields lifted from different factors. We demonstrate this for $\\nabla_X T$. Let $W$ be an arbitrary test vector field on $M$.\n$$2g(\\nabla_X T, W) = X(g(T,W)) + T(g(X,W)) - W(g(X,T)) + g([X,T],W) - g([X,W],T) - g([T,W],X)$$\nSince $g(X,T)=0$ and $[X,T]=0$, the terms $W(g(X,T))$ and $g([X,T],W)$ vanish. To analyze the other terms, we decompose $W$ into its components tangent to the factors, $W = W_S + W_R$. Since $g$ is a product metric, $g(A,B) = 0$ if $A$ is tangent to one factor and $B$ to the other.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $X(g(T,W)) = X(g(T, W_S + W_R)) = X(g(T,W_S)) + X(g(T,W_R)) = X(0) + X(g_R(T,W_R))$. Since $g_R(T,W_R)$ depends only on the $t$ coordinate, $X(g_R(T,W_R)) = 0$.\n    \\item $T(g(X,W)) = T(g(X, W_S + W_R)) = T(g(X,W_S)) + T(g(X,W_R)) = T(g_S(X,W_S)) + T(0)$. Since $g_S(X,W_S)$ depends only on the $\\mathbb{S}^2_\\rho$ coordinates, $T(g_S(X,W_S)) = 0$.\n    \\item $[X,W]$ decomposes as $[X, W_S] + [X, W_R]$. $[X, W_S]$ is tangent to the sphere, and $[X, W_R] = 0$. Thus $g([X,W], T)=g([X,W_S],T)=0$.\n    \\item Similarly, $[T,W]$ decomposes as $[T, W_S] + [T, W_R]$. $[T, W_S]=0$, and $[T, W_R]$ is tangent to the real line. Thus $g([T,W],X)=g([T,W_R],X)=0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAll terms in the Koszul formula for $2g(\\nabla_X T, W)$ are zero. Since this holds for any $W$, we conclude that $\\nabla_X T = 0$. By a symmetric argument (or by noting that $\\nabla_X Y - \\nabla_Y X = [X,Y]$ and $[X,T]=0$), it also follows that $\\nabla_T X=0$.\n\nNext, we compute $\\nabla_T T$. The vector field $T=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is a unit vector field on the flat manifold $\\mathbb{R}$. It is a geodesic vector field, meaning its integral curves are geodesics. Thus, we expect $\\nabla_T T = 0$. Using the Koszul formula:\n$$2g(\\nabla_T T, W) = 2T(g(T,W)) - W(g(T,T)) + g([T,T],W) - 2g([T,W],T)$$\nSince $g(T,T)=1$, $W(g(T,T)) = 0$. Also, $[T,T]=0$. The formula simplifies to $2g(\\nabla_T T, W) = 2T(g(T,W)) - 2g([T,W],T)$. Decomposing $W=W_S+W_R$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $W=W_S$, then $g(T,W_S)=0$ and $[T,W_S]=0$. Thus $g(\\nabla_T T, W_S)=0$.\n    \\item If $W=W_R = f(t)T$, then $g(T,W_R)=f(t)$, so $T(g(T,W_R))=\\frac{df}{dt}$. Also, $[T,W_R]=[T, fT]=T(f)T=\\frac{df}{dt}T$. So $g([T,W_R],T) = g(\\frac{df}{dt}T, T)=\\frac{df}{dt}$. This gives $2g(\\nabla_T T, W_R) = 2\\frac{df}{dt}-2\\frac{df}{dt}=0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $g(\\nabla_T T, W) = 0$ for all $W$, we have $\\nabla_T T = 0$.\n\nNow we can assemble the Riemann tensor term:\n$$R(X,T)T = \\nabla_X \\nabla_T T - \\nabla_T \\nabla_X T - \\nabla_{[X,T]} T$$\nSubstituting the derived results $\\nabla_T T = 0$, $\\nabla_X T = 0$, and $[X,T]=0$:\n$$R(X,T)T = \\nabla_X(0) - \\nabla_T(0) - \\nabla_0 T = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$$\nFinally, we compute the sectional curvature:\n$$K(\\sigma) = g(R(X,T)T, X) = g(0, X) = 0$$\nThe sectional curvature of any mixed $2$-plane in a Riemannian product manifold is zero.\n\nGeometrically, a non-zero sectional curvature quantifies the deviation of the geometry from being locally Euclidean. The result $K(\\sigma)=0$ signifies that the product structure $(M_1 \\times M_2, g_1+g_2)$ introduces no curvature interaction between the factor manifolds. Parallel transport of a vector tangent to one factor along a curve in the other factor produces no rotation. This \"decoupling\" of the geometries of $\\mathbb{S}^{2}_{\\rho}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ means that a small surface patch generated by geodesics in the directions of $X$ and $T$ is intrinsically flat. The bending of the manifold is confined entirely to planes tangent to the individual factors (i.e., non-mixed planes).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3062480"}, {"introduction": "Warped products generalize the simple product construction by allowing the metric of one manifold to be scaled by a function on the other, introducing a rich interaction between the factors.

The warp function is $f(r)$. The two conditions become:\n1. $f''(r) - f(r) = 0$.\n2. $(f'(r))^2 - f(r)^2 = 1$.\n\nThe general solution to the first ordinary differential equation (ODE) is $f(r) = A e^r + B e^{-r}$ for constants $A, B \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nWe substitute this into the second ODE. The derivative is $f'(r) = A e^r - B e^{-r}$.\n$(A e^r - B e^{-r})^2 - (A e^r + B e^{-r})^2 = 1$\n$(A^2 e^{2r} - 2AB + B^2 e^{-2r}) - (A^2 e^{2r} + 2AB + B^2 e^{-2r}) = 1$\n$-4AB = 1 \\implies AB = -1/4$.\nThe solutions are of the form $f(r) = A e^r - \\frac{1}{4A} e^{-r}$.\nLet $A = C/2$ for some constant $C \\neq 0$. Then $B = -1/(2C)$, and $f(r) = \\frac{C}{2}e^r - \\frac{1}{2C}e^{-r}$.\nThis can be written using hyperbolic functions. If we set $C=e^\\delta$, then $f(r) = \\frac{e^\\delta}{2}e^r - \\frac{e^{-\\delta}}{2}e^{-r} = \\sinh(r+\\delta)$. If we set $C=-e^{\\delta}$, then $f(r) = - \\sinh(r+\\delta)$.\nSo, the general solution is $f(r) = \\pm \\sinh(r+\\delta)$. The parameter $\\delta$ corresponds to a shift in the origin of the $r$-coordinate, so we can set $\\delta=0$ to find the canonical function.\nThis gives $f(r) = \\pm \\sinh(r)$.\nThe problem states that $f$ must be a positive function, $f(r)  0$.\nIf we choose $f(r) = \\sinh(r)$, we must restrict the domain $I$ to $(0, \\infty)$.\nIf we choose $f(r) = -\\sinh(r)$, we must restrict $I$ to $(-\\infty, 0)$.\nBy convention, we choose the former. Thus, the canonical warp function is $f(r) = \\sinh(r)$.\n\n**Part 2: Euclidean Fiber Model**\nHere, the fiber is $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ with its standard flat metric, so its sectional curvature is ${}^{(F)}K = 0$ for all planes. The warp function is $h(r)$. The two conditions become:\n1. $h''(r) - h(r) = 0$.\n2. $(h'(r))^2 - h(r)^2 = 0$.\n\nThe second ODE, $(h')^2=h^2$, implies $h'(r) = \\pm h(r)$.\nThis is a separable first-order ODE.\nIf $h' = h$, then $\\frac{dh}{h}=dr$, which integrates to $\\ln|h| = r + C_1$. Since $h(r)0$, we have $h(r) = e^{C_1} e^r = C e^r$ for $C0$.\nIf $h' = -h$, then $\\frac{dh}{h}=-dr$, which integrates to $\\ln|h| = -r + C_2$, so $h(r) = C e^{-r}$ for $C0$.\nWe must verify that these solutions also satisfy the first ODE, $h'' - h = 0$.\nFor $h(r) = C e^r$, we have $h'(r) = C e^r$ and $h''(r) = C e^r$. Thus $h''-h = C e^r - C e^r = 0$. This is a valid solution.\nFor $h(r) = C e^{-r}$, we have $h'(r) = -C e^{-r}$ and $h''(r) = C e^{-r}$. Thus $h''-h = C e^{-r} - C e^{-r} = 0$. This is also a valid solution.\nThe constant $C$ can be absorbed by a shift in the $r$ coordinate. For example, if $h(r)=Ce^r$, let $\\tilde{r} = r + \\ln(C)$, so $r=\\tilde{r}-\\ln(C)$. Then $dr=d\\tilde{r}$, and the metric becomes $d\\tilde{r}^2 + (Ce^{\\tilde{r}-\\ln C})^2 g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}} = d\\tilde{r}^2 + (e^{\\tilde{r}})^2 g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$.\nTherefore, we can set $C=1$ to obtain the canonical function. The choice between $e^r$ and $e^{-r}$ corresponds to a choice of orientation for the $r$-coordinate. The canonical choice is usually taken to be $h(r) = e^r$.\n\nThe pair of canonical warp functions is $(f(r), h(r))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sinh(r)  e^r\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3062483"}]}
