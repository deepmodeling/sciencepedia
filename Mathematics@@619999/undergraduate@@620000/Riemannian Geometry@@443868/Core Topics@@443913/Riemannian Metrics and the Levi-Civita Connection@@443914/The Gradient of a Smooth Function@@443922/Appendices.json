It requests the derivation of the gradient of a radial function on the Euclidean plane from first principles, a standard exercise in differential geometry. All terms are clearly defined, and the premises are consistent with established mathematical theory. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by formally deriving the expression for the gradient, $\\nabla f$, of a smooth function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. The gradient vector field $\\nabla f$ is uniquely defined by the relation:\n$$\ng(\\nabla f, X) = df(X)\n$$\nfor every smooth vector field $X$ on $M$.\n\nThe manifold under consideration is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the standard Euclidean metric, which in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ is given by $g = dx^2 + dy^2$. In this coordinate system, the local basis for the tangent space at any point is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\}$. The components of the metric tensor are $g_{xx} = 1$, $g_{yy} = 1$, and $g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$.\n\nLet us express the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$ and an arbitrary test vector field $X$ in terms of their Cartesian components:\n$$\n\\nabla f = (\\nabla f)^x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (\\nabla f)^y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\nX = X^x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + X^y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThe left-hand side of the defining identity becomes:\n$$\ng(\\nabla f, X) = g\\left( (\\nabla f)^x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (\\nabla f)^y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, X^x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + X^y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nBy the bilinearity of the metric, and using the component values $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) = 1$, $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = 1$, and $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = 0$, we have:\n$$\ng(\\nabla f, X) = (\\nabla f)^x X^x + (\\nabla f)^y X^y\n$$\n\nThe right-hand side of the defining identity involves the differential $df$ of the function $f$. In Cartesian coordinates, the differential is given by:\n$$\ndf = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy\n$$\nApplying $df$ to the vector field $X$ yields:\n$$\ndf(X) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy \\right) \\left( X^x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + X^y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} X^x + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} X^y\n$$\n\nEquating the expressions for $g(\\nabla f, X)$ and $df(X)$:\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^x X^x + (\\nabla f)^y X^y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} X^x + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} X^y\n$$\nThis identity must hold for all choices of components $X^x$ and $X^y$. By choosing $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ (i.e., $X^x=1, X^y=0$) and then $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ (i.e., $X^x=0, X^y=1$), we can individually equate the coefficients:\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^x = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThus, for the Euclidean metric in Cartesian coordinates, the gradient vector field is simply $\\nabla f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that $f$ is a smooth radial function, meaning $f$ depends only on the radius $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We write this as $f(x,y) = f(r(x,y))$. We denote the derivative of $f$ with respect to its argument $r$ by $f'(r) = \\frac{df}{dr}$. To find the Cartesian components of $\\nabla f$, we must compute the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ using the chain rule.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}(2x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = \\frac{x}{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}(2y) = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = \\frac{y}{r}\n$$\nNote that these expressions are well-defined on the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$, where $r > 0$.\n\nNow, applying the chain rule to $f$:\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^x = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{df}{dr} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x} = f'(r) \\frac{x}{r}\n$$\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{df}{dr} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial y} = f'(r) \\frac{y}{r}\n$$\nThe gradient vector field can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\nabla f = \\left(f'(r) \\frac{x}{r}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\left(f'(r) \\frac{y}{r}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = \\frac{f'(r)}{r} \\left(x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ gives the components purely in terms of $x$ and $y$:\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^x = \\frac{f'(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} x\n$$\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^y = \\frac{f'(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} y\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $\\nabla f$ in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nNext, we justify that $\\nabla f$ is directed along the radial direction. The vector component of $\\nabla f$ is $x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. At a point $p=(x,y)$, this vector corresponds to the tuple $(x,y)$, which is the position vector of the point $p$ relative to the origin. The direction of the position vector is, by definition, the radial direction. Since $\\nabla f$ is a scalar multiple, $\\frac{f'(r)}{r}$, of this radial vector field, $\\nabla f$ is itself directed along the radial direction at every point.\n\nFinally, we determine the magnitude of $\\nabla f$, denoted $\\|\\nabla f\\|_g$. The magnitude squared is given by $\\|\\nabla f\\|_g^2 = g(\\nabla f, \\nabla f)$. Using the Cartesian components we derived:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla f\\|_g^2 = \\left(f'(r) \\frac{x}{r}\\right)^2 + \\left(f'(r) \\frac{y}{r}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(f'(r))^2}{r^2} (x^2 + y^2)\n$$\nSince $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla f\\|_g^2 = \\frac{(f'(r))^2}{r^2} (r^2) = (f'(r))^2\n$$\nThe magnitude of the gradient is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla f\\|_g = \\sqrt{(f'(r))^2} = |f'(r)|\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the magnitude of the gradient of a radial function depends only on the rate of change of the function with respect to the radius.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{f'(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} x & \\frac{f'(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} y \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3071952"}, {"introduction": "Having built our intuition on flat, isotropic space, we now investigate a crucial idea: the gradient's direction is determined by the metric.

Using our results $\\widetilde{\\nabla} f = \\frac{1}{c}\\nabla f$ and $\\tilde g = c \\, g$:\n$$|\\widetilde{\\nabla} f|_{\\tilde g}^2 = (c \\, g)\\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\nabla f, \\frac{1}{c}\\nabla f\\right) = c \\cdot \\frac{1}{c^2} g(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) = \\frac{1}{c} g(\\nabla f, \\nabla f)$$\nSince $|\\nabla f|_g^2 = g(\\nabla f, \\nabla f)$, we have:\n$$|\\widetilde{\\nabla} f|_{\\tilde g}^2 = \\frac{1}{c} |\\nabla f|_g^2$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (norms are non-negative) gives:\n$$|\\widetilde{\\nabla} f|_{\\tilde g} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} |\\nabla f|_g$$\nThe statement claims the scaling factor is $c$, while the correct factor is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Both the gradient $\\nabla f$ and the differential $df$ are invariant under the constant rescaling $\\tilde g = c\\, g$.**\nThe differential $df$ is indeed invariant, as it does not depend on the metric.\nHowever, the gradient $\\nabla f$ is not invariant. We found $\\widetilde{\\nabla} f = \\frac{1}{c} \\nabla f$. Unless $c=1$ (i.e., the metric is unchanged), $\\widetilde{\\nabla} f \\neq \\nabla f$. Therefore, the gradient is not invariant.\nSince one part of the statement is false, the entire statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3071992"}]}
