The problem states that $D$ is the standard flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is given by the directional derivative in Cartesian coordinates.

The torsion tensor $T$ vanishes identically if and only if $T(X,Y) = 0$ for all smooth vector fields $X, Y$. From our first result, this is equivalent to:\n$$\nA(X,Y) - A(Y,X) = 0 \\quad \\forall X,Y \\in \\mathfrak{X}(M)\n$$\nThis condition can be rewritten as:\n$$\nA(X,Y) = A(Y,X)\n$$\nThis is the definition of a symmetric tensor.
