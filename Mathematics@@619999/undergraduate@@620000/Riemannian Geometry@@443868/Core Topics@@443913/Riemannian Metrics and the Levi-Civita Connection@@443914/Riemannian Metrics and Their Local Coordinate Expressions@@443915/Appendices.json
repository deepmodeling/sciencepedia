It is a standard exercise in differential geometry concerning the transformation of a Riemannian metric under a change of coordinates.\n\nWe begin by validating the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Manifold and initial coordinates: $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with Cartesian coordinates $(x^{1},x^{2})$.\n- Initial metric: Standard Euclidean metric with components $g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n- Coordinate transformation: A smooth map from $(u,v)$-coordinates to $(x^{1},x^{2})$-coordinates given by $x^{1}=u$ and $x^{2}=v+u^{2}$.\n- Task: Derive the metric components $g'_{ab}(u,v)$ in the new coordinates, write the line element $ds^{2}$, and check for symmetry and positive definiteness.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. It deals with fundamental concepts of Riemannian geometry, namely the behavior of the metric tensor under coordinate transformations. The provided transformation is smooth, and all definitions are standard. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It is not trivial and requires a correct application of tensor calculus.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nA Riemannian metric $g$ at a point $p$ on a manifold is an inner product on the tangent space $T_{p}M$. The line element $ds^{2}$ represents the squared norm of an infinitesimal displacement vector $d\\mathbf{x}$, which is an element of the tangent space. In local coordinates $(x^i)$, $d\\mathbf{x} = dx^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$ (using Einstein summation), and its squared length is $ds^{2} = g(d\\mathbf{x}, d\\mathbf{x}) = g_{ij} dx^{i} dx^{j}$.\n\nLet the original coordinates be $(x^{1},x^{2})$ and the new coordinates be $(y^{1}, y^{2}) = (u,v)$. The problem states that tangent vectors transform by the chain rule. A basis vector in the new coordinate system is related to the basis vectors of the old system by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{a}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} $$\nThe metric components $g'_{ab}$ in the new coordinate system $(y^{a})=(u,v)$ are defined by the inner products of the new basis vectors:\n$$ g'_{ab} = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{a}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{b}}\\right) = g\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}, \\sum_{j=1}^{2} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{b}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) $$\nBy the bilinearity of the metric and the fact that $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}) = g_{ij}$, this expands to:\n$$ g'_{ab} = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{2} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{a}} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{b}} g_{ij} $$\nThis is the fundamental transformation law for the components of a type-$(0,2)$ tensor like the metric tensor.\n\nThe given transformation is $x^{1}=u$ and $x^{2}=v+u^{2}$. We identify $y^{1}=u$ and $y^{2}=v$. The original metric components are $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, so $g_{11}=1$, $g_{22}=1$, and $g_{12}=g_{21}=0$. The transformation law simplifies to:\n$$ g'_{ab} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{a}} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{b}} $$\nWe need to compute the partial derivatives, which form the Jacobian matrix of the transformation from $(u,v)$ to $(x^{1},x^{2})$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial u} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial v} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial u} = 2u, \\quad \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial v} = 1 $$\n\nNow we can compute the components of the new metric tensor $g'$ in the $(u,v)$ coordinates.\nFor $g'_{uu} = g'_{11}$:\n$$ g'_{uu} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial u}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial u}\\right)^{2} = (1)^{2} + (2u)^{2} = 1 + 4u^{2} $$\nFor $g'_{vv} = g'_{22}$:\n$$ g'_{vv} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial v}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial v}\\right)^{2} = (0)^{2} + (1)^{2} = 1 $$\nFor the off-diagonal components $g'_{uv} = g'_{12}$:\n$$ g'_{uv} = \\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial u}\\frac{\\partial x^{1}}{\\partial v} + \\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial u}\\frac{\\partial x^{2}}{\\partial v} = (1)(0) + (2u)(1) = 2u $$\nBy the symmetry of the metric tensor, we must have $g'_{vu} = g'_{uv}$, so $g'_{vu} = 2u$. This can also be computed directly and yields the same result.\n\nThe matrix representation of the metric tensor in $(u,v)$ coordinates is:\n$$ g' = \\begin{pmatrix} g'_{uu} & g'_{uv} \\\\ g'_{vu} & g'_{vv} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+4u^{2} & 2u \\\\ 2u & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe line element $ds^{2}$ in the new coordinates is given by $ds^{2} = g'_{ab} dy^{a} dy^{b}$. Writing this out explicitly:\n$$ ds^{2} = g'_{uu} (du)^{2} + g'_{uv} du\\,dv + g'_{vu} dv\\,du + g'_{vv} (dv)^{2} $$\n$$ ds^{2} = (1+4u^{2}) (du)^{2} + 2u\\,du\\,dv + 2u\\,dv\\,du + 1\\cdot(dv)^{2} $$\nSince $du\\,dv = dv\\,du$, we combine the cross-terms:\n$$ ds^{2} = (1+4u^{2}) (du)^{2} + 4u\\,du\\,dv + (dv)^{2} $$\n\nFinally, we check the symmetry and positive definiteness of the resulting metric tensor $g'$ at every point $(u,v)$.\n**Symmetry:** The matrix for $g'$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1+4u^{2} & 2u \\\\ 2u & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since the $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ components are equal ($2u=2u$), the tensor is symmetric for all $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\n**Positive Definiteness:** For a $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix to be positive definite, its leading principal minors must be positive.\nThe first leading principal minor is $g'_{uu} = 1+4u^{2}$. For any real number $u$, $u^{2} \\ge 0$, which implies $4u^{2} \\ge 0$, and thus $1+4u^{2} \\ge 1 > 0$. This condition is satisfied for all $u$.\nThe second leading principal minor is the determinant of the matrix $g'$:\n$$ \\det(g') = g'_{uu} g'_{vv} - (g'_{uv})^{2} = (1+4u^{2})(1) - (2u)^{2} = 1+4u^{2} - 4u^{2} = 1 $$\nSince the determinant is $1 > 0$ for all $(u,v)$, and the first principal minor is also always positive, the metric tensor $g'$ is positive definite everywhere. This confirms that the derived expression for $ds^2$ indeed corresponds to a valid Riemannian metric.\nThe final expression for the line element is the simplified form derived above.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(1 + 4u^2) du^2 + 4u \\, du \\, dv + dv^2}\n$$", "id": "3063809"}, {"introduction": "The primary purpose of a Riemannian metric is to equip a space with a notion of length, angle, and area.

A Riemannian metric must be a smooth, symmetric, positive-definite $(0,2)$-tensor field.\n1.  **Symmetry**: The given matrix is symmetric ($g_{12}=g_{21}=0$), so this condition is satisfied.\n2.  **Smoothness**: For $g$ to be a smooth tensor field, its components $g_{ij}$ in these smooth global coordinates must be smooth functions. The components $g_{11}=1$, $g_{12}=0$, and $g_{21}=0$ are constant and thus smooth. The component $g_{22}=f(x)$ must therefore be a smooth function of $x$. This means $f$ must belong to the class $C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$.\n3.  **Positive-definiteness**: At every point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the matrix $[g_{ij}]$ must be positive-definite. For a $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix, this is equivalent to the conditions that the top-left entry is positive and the determinant is positive.\n    - The first condition is $g_{11} > 0$. Here, $g_{11}=1$, which is indeed positive.\n    - The second condition is $\\det([g_{ij}]) > 0$. The determinant is $\\det([g_{ij}]) = g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21} = (1)(f(x)) - (0)(0) = f(x)$.\n    Thus, we must have $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nCombining these, the necessary and sufficient conditions for $g$ to be a smooth Riemannian metric on all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are that $f$ is a smooth function ($f \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$) and is strictly positive on $\\mathbb{R}$ ($f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n\nSecond, we analyze the situation where there exists an $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_0)=0$ and $f'(x_0) \\neq 0$.\n-   **Positive-definiteness**: At any point $(x_0, y)$ on the line $x=x_0$, the determinant of the metric tensor is $\\det(g) = f(x_0) = 0$. A matrix with a zero determinant is singular and therefore not positive-definite. It is merely positive semi-definite. At such points, the tensor field $g$ is degenerate and fails to define a Riemannian metric. Geometrically, any tangent vector of the form $v = c \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ for $c \\neq 0$ has length zero: $g(v,v) = g_{22} c^2 = f(x_0) c^2 = 0$.\n-   **Inverse metric components**: The inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$ is the matrix inverse of $[g_{ij}]$.\n    $$\n    [g^{ij}] = [g_{ij}]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(g)}\\begin{pmatrix} g_{22} & -g_{12} \\\\ -g_{21} & g_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{f(x)}\\begin{pmatrix} f(x) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{f(x)} \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The component $g^{22}(x) = \\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is defined and smooth only where $f(x) \\neq 0$. In a neighborhood of $x_0$, since $f(x_0)=0$, the component $g^{22}$ is singular. As $x \\to x_0$, $g^{22}(x)$ diverges to infinity. Therefore, the inverse metric tensor is not defined, let alone smooth, at any point where $x=x_0$.\n-   **Implications**: The Levi-Civita connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols) $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are defined using the inverse metric: $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}(\\partial_i g_{lj} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$. Because the components $g^{kl}$ are singular at $x=x_0$, the Christoffel symbols will generally be singular as well. Specifically, as we will compute below, $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{f'(x)}{2f(x)}$. Since $f(x_0)=0$ and $f'(x_0) \\neq 0$, this component blows up at $x=x_0$. Consequently, the Riemann curvature tensor, which is constructed from the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives, will also be singular. These points represent a singularity of the geometry induced by the tensor field $g$.\n\nThird, we compute the Gaussian curvature $K(x)$ wherever the metric is Riemannian, i.e., where $f(x)>0$.
