All definitions pertaining to the unit circle $S^{1}$, the induced Riemannian metric, the Riemannian distance $d_{S^{1}}(x,y)$, and the Euclidean chord distance $\\|x-y\\|$ are standard and mathematically correct. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and free of scientific or logical flaws. The specific points provided for calculation are valid members of $S^{1}$. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nLet $x$ and $y$ be two points on the unit circle $S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Their position vectors from the origin, also denoted by $x$ and $y$, have unit length, i.e., $\\|x\\|=1$ and $\\|y\\|=1$.

The dot product of the vectors is related to this angle by $x \\cdot y = \\|x\\|\\|y\\|\\cos\\theta = \\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe problem states that great-circle arcs are geodesics on $S^{1}$. On a circle, these are simply the circular arcs. The Riemannian distance $d_{S^{1}}(x,y)$ is the length of the shortest path on the manifold between $x$ and $y$. This corresponds to the length of the shorter circular arc connecting them. The length $L$ of an arc of a circle with radius $R$ that subtends an angle $\\alpha$ (in radians) is given by the formula $L = R\\alpha$. For the unit circle $S^{1}$, the radius is $R=1$. The shorter arc subtends the smaller central angle $\\theta$. Therefore, the Riemannian distance is:\n$$\nd_{S^{1}}(x,y) = 1 \\cdot \\theta = \\theta\n$$\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the Euclidean distance $\\|x-y\\|$, which is the length of the chord connecting the points $x$ and $y$. We use the properties of the Euclidean norm and the dot product:\n$$\n\\|x-y\\|^2 = (x-y) \\cdot (x-y) = x \\cdot x - 2(x \\cdot y) + y \\cdot y\n$$\nSince $x, y \\in S^{1}$, we have $x \\cdot x = \\|x\\|^2 = 1$ and $y \\cdot y = \\|y\\|^2 = 1$.

In this interval, the sine function is non-negative, so $\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right| = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$. Thus, the Euclidean distance is:\n$$\n\\|x-y\\| = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now establish a rigorous inequality between the arc length $d_{S^{1}}(x,y) = \\theta$ and the chord length $\\|x-y\\| = 2\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$. Geometrically, the shortest distance between two points in a Euclidean space is a straight line, so we expect the chord length to be less than or equal to the arc length. We will prove that $d_{S^{1}}(x,y) \\ge \\|x-y\\|$, which translates to proving $\\theta \\ge 2\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$.\n\nLet $u = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$. The inequality becomes $2u \\ge 2\\sin(u)$, or $u \\ge \\sin(u)$, for $u \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\nTo prove this, we define a function $f(u) = u - \\sin(u)$ on the interval $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\nWe evaluate the function at the start of the interval: $f(0) = 0 - \\sin(0) = 0$.\nNext, we examine the derivative of the function: $f'(u) = \\frac{d}{du}(u - \\sin(u)) = 1 - \\cos(u)$.\nFor any $u$ in the open interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we have $0  \\cos(u)  1$. Consequently, $f'(u) = 1 - \\cos(u)  0$ for $u \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nSince $f(0) = 0$ and its derivative is non-negative on the interval $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ (and strictly positive on $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$), the function $f(u)$ is non-decreasing on $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$. This implies $f(u) \\ge f(0) = 0$ for all $u \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\nTherefore, $u - \\sin(u) \\ge 0$, which means $u \\ge \\sin(u)$. Substituting back $u=\\frac{\\theta}{2}$ and multiplying by $2$ confirms that $\\theta \\ge 2\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$. This establishes the inequality $d_{S^{1}}(x,y) \\ge \\|x-y\\|$ for all $x,y \\in S^1$, with equality holding if and only if $\\theta=0$, i.e., $x=y$.\n\nFinally, we compute the specified ratio for the points $x=(1,0)$ and $y=(\\cos(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}),\\,\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}))$.\nThe point $x$ corresponds to an angle of $0$ radians.

It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and devoid of any ambiguities. I will therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe first step is to establish a coordinate system and derive the induced Riemannian metric on the unit $2$-sphere, $S^2$. We embed $S^2$ in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and use the standard spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ is the polar angle (colatitude) and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle.

The components of the metric tensor, $g_{ij}$, are given by the inner product (dot product) of the tangent vectors to the coordinate curves: $g_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial u^i} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial u^j}$.\n\nThe tangent vectors are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\theta} = (\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi, -\\sin\\theta) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\phi} = (-\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, 0) $$\nThe metric tensor components are calculated as follows:\n$$ g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\theta} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\theta} = (\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi)^2 + (\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi)^2 + (-\\sin\\theta)^2 = \\cos^2\\theta(\\cos^2\\phi + \\sin^2\\phi) + \\sin^2\\theta = \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1 $$\n$$ g_{\\phi\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\phi} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\phi} = (-\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi)^2 + (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi)^2 + 0^2 = \\sin^2\\theta(\\sin^2\\phi + \\cos^2\\phi) = \\sin^2\\theta $$\n$$ g_{\\theta\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\theta} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi + \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi + 0 = 0 $$\nThe line element $ds$ for an infinitesimal arc length on $S^2$ is thus given by the first fundamental form:\n$$ ds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta}d\\theta^2 + 2g_{\\theta\\phi}d\\theta d\\phi + g_{\\phi\\phi}d\\phi^2 = d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2 $$\nNext, we identify the set of points comprising the geodesic circle $S_r(p)$. The Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting points $p$ and $q$. Due to the rotational symmetry of the sphere, we can, without loss of generality, select the fixed point $p$ to be the North Pole, which in our coordinate system corresponds to $\\theta = 0$.\n\nThe shortest path (a geodesic) from the North Pole to any other point $q$ on the sphere is an arc of a great circle. In our coordinates, these paths are meridians, which are curves of constant $\\phi$. For a curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\theta(t), \\phi_0)$ with constant $\\phi_0$, the arc length from the pole $(\\theta=0)$ to a point with colatitude $\\theta_q$ is:\n$$ L(\\gamma) = \\int \\sqrt{d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2} = \\int_0^{\\theta_q} \\sqrt{(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt})^2 dt^2 + 0} $$\nIf we parametrize by $\\theta$ itself, the length is simply $\\int_0^{\\theta_q} d\\theta = \\theta_q$. Since geodesics are the shortest paths, the Riemannian distance from the North Pole to a point $q$ with colatitude $\\theta_q$ is $d(p,q) = \\theta_q$.\n\nThe problem defines the geodesic circle $S_r(p)$ as the locus of points $q$ such that $d(p,q)=r$. With $p$ at the North Pole, this means $S_r(p)$ is the set of points where the colatitude $\\theta$ is equal to $r$. This is a circle of constant latitude on the sphere. We can parametrize this circle, which we denote $\\mathcal{C}_r$, by $\\alpha(\\phi) = (r, \\phi)$, with the parameter $\\phi$ ranging from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\nThe length of the geodesic circle, $L(r)$, is found by integrating the line element $ds$ along the curve $\\mathcal{C}_r$. Along this curve, $\\theta = r$ is constant, so its differential $d\\theta$ is $0$. The line element simplifies to:\n$$ ds = \\sqrt{0^2 + \\sin^2(r) d\\phi^2} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2(r)} |d\\phi| = |\\sin(r)| d\\phi $$\nSince the problem states $r \\in (0, \\pi)$, we have $\\sin(r)  0$. Thus, $ds = \\sin(r) d\\phi$.\n\nThe total length $L(r)$ is the integral over the full range of the parameter $\\phi$:\n$$ L(r) = \\int_{\\mathcal{C}_r} ds = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin(r) d\\phi $$\nAs $\\sin(r)$ is constant with respect to the integration variable $\\phi$, we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$ L(r) = \\sin(r) \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = \\sin(r) [\\phi]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi \\sin(r) $$\nThis is the required exact, closed-form analytic expression for the length of the geodesic circle.\n\nFinally, for comparison with the Euclidean case, we examine the behavior of $L(r)$ for small $r$ by finding its Taylor expansion around $r=0$. The Maclaurin series for the sine function is:\n$$ \\sin(r) = r - \\frac{r^3}{3!} + \\frac{r^5}{5!} - \\dots = r - \\frac{r^3}{6} + O(r^5) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $L(r)$ yields:\n$$ L(r) = 2\\pi \\left( r - \\frac{r^3}{6} + O(r^5) \\right) = 2\\pi r - \\frac{\\pi r^3}{3} + O(r^5) $$\nThe circumference of a circle of radius $r$ in a flat Euclidean plane is $C_E(r) = 2\\pi r$. The leading-order term of $L(r)$ matches the Euclidean formula, which is expected as any smooth manifold is locally Euclidean. The first-order correction term, $-\\frac{\\pi r^3}{3}$, is negative. This shows that for a given geodesic distance $r$ from a center point, the circumference of the circle is smaller on a sphere than in a flat plane.

A direct consequence is that the length of a curve $\\gamma$ on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ is equal to the length of any of its lifts $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. That is, $L_{g_{\\mathbb{T}^2}}(\\gamma) = L_{g_E}(\\tilde{\\gamma})$.\n\nWe want to compute $d_{\\mathbb{T}^2}(p, q)$ where $p = \\pi(0,0)$ and $q = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nLet $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{T}^2$ be any piecewise smooth curve with $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma(1) = q$.\nSince $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{T}^2$ is a covering map, we can lift $\\gamma$ to a curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$. Let's choose the lift that starts at the point $\\tilde{p} = (0,0) \\in \\pi^{-1}(p)$.

This is equivalent to minimizing the expression inside the square root, $f(m,n) = (\\frac{1}{2}+m)^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}+n)^2$. The minimum is achieved by choosing integers $m$ and $n$ that minimize the absolute values $|\\frac{1}{2}+m|$ and $|\\frac{1}{2}+n|$ respectively.\nFor an integer $m$, the value $|\\frac{1}{2}+m|$ is minimized when $m$ is as close as possible to $-\\frac{1}{2}$.

For both, we get $|\\frac{1}{2}+0| = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $|\\frac{1}{2}-1| = |-\\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSimilarly, the minimum value for $|\\frac{1}{2}+n|$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, achieved when $n=0$ or $n=-1$.\nThus, the minimum value of $f(m,n)$ is achieved for four pairs of integers $(m,n)$: $(0,0)$, $(0,-1)$, $(-1,0)$, and $(-1,-1)$. For any of these pairs, the squared distance is:\n$$\\left(\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe minimum distance is the square root of this value.\n$$d_{\\mathbb{T}^2}(p,q) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\nThis explains why there are multiple minimizing geodesics.
