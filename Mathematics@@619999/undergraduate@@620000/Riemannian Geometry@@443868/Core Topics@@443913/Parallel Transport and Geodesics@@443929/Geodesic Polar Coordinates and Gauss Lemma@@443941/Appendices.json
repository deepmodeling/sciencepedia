The derivation proceeds in four main steps: computing the metric components in these coordinates, establishing geometric properties, calculating the volume form, and finally identifying the function $J(r)$.\n\nThe Riemannian manifold is the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with its standard metric $g_{\\mathrm{E}}$, which corresponds to the dot product on tangent spaces. We consider geodesic polar coordinates $(r, \\theta^{1}, \\dots, \\theta^{n-1})$ centered at the origin $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by the map $F: (0,\\infty) \\times U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $U \\subset \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is a coordinate patch on the unit sphere. The map is defined as $F(r, \\theta) = r \\Phi(\\theta)$, where $\\Phi: U \\to \\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the local chart for the sphere, and $\\theta = (\\theta^{1}, \\dots, \\theta^{n-1})$.\n\nFirst, we derive the coordinate vector fields under the differential $dF$ and compute the components of the pullback metric $g = F^{*}g_{\\mathrm{E}}$. The components $g_{\\alpha\\beta}$ are given by $g_{\\alpha\\beta} = g_{\\mathrm{E}}(dF(\\partial_{\\alpha}), dF(\\partial_{\\beta})) = \\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u^{\\alpha}}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u^{\\beta}} \\rangle$, where $(u^{1}, \\dots, u^{n}) = (r, \\theta^{1}, \\dots, \\theta^{n-1})$ and $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle$ is the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\nThe partial derivatives of the map $F(r, \\theta)$ are:\nWith respect to the radial coordinate $r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} (r \\Phi(\\theta)) = \\Phi(\\theta) $$\nWith respect to the angular coordinates $\\theta^{i}$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\theta^{i}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^{i}} (r \\Phi(\\theta)) = r \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{i}} $$\nNow, we compute the metric components:\n\n1.  The radial-radial component, $g_{rr}$:\n    $$ g_{rr} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial r} \\right\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi(\\theta), \\Phi(\\theta) \\rangle $$\n    By definition, $\\Phi(\\theta)$ is a point on the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, so it is a unit vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Thus, its norm-squared is $1$.\n    $$ g_{rr} = |\\Phi(\\theta)|^{2} = 1 $$\n\n2.  The mixed radial-angular components, $g_{ri}$:\n    $$ g_{ri} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\theta^{i}} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\Phi(\\theta), r \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{i}} \\right\\rangle = r \\left\\langle \\Phi(\\theta), \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{i}} \\right\\rangle $$\n    To evaluate the inner product, we use the fact that $|\\Phi(\\theta)|^{2} = 1$.

Substituting this back into the expression for $g_{ri}$:\n    $$ g_{ri} = r \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n\n3.  The angular-angular components, $g_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$:\n    $$ g_{ij} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\theta^{i}}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\theta^{j}} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle r \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{i}}, r \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{j}} \\right\\rangle = r^{2} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{i}}, \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{j}} \\right\\rangle $$\n\nThe metric tensor $g$ in $(r, \\theta^{1}, \\dots, \\theta^{n-1})$ coordinates can be written in block matrix form:\n$$ (g_{\\alpha\\beta}) = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{rr}  g_{ri} \\\\ g_{ir}  g_{ij} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\mathbf{0}^{T} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}  (g_{ij}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{0}$ is a zero vector of size $n-1$.\n\nNext, we establish the geometric interpretation. The fact that $g_{ri} = 0$ for all $i$ means the radial direction (represented by the vector field $\\partial_{r}$) is orthogonal to all angular directions (represented by $\\partial_{\\theta^{i}}$). This is a manifestation of Gauss's Lemma.\n\nThe metric induced on the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ via the inclusion into $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is denoted by $\\bar{g}$. In the local coordinates $\\theta$, its components $\\bar{g}_{ij}$ are given by the pullback of the Euclidean metric via the map $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\bar{g}_{ij} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{i}}, \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{j}} \\right\\rangle $$\nComparing this to our expression for $g_{ij}$, we see that:\n$$ g_{ij} = r^{2} \\bar{g}_{ij} $$\nThis shows that the metric on a sphere of radius $r$ is conformal to the standard metric on the unit sphere, with a scaling factor of $r^{2}$.\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the metric $g$. Since the matrix $(g_{\\alpha\\beta})$ is block diagonal, its determinant is the product of the determinants of the diagonal blocks:\n$$ \\det(g) = g_{rr} \\cdot \\det((g_{ij})) = 1 \\cdot \\det(r^{2}(\\bar{g}_{ij})) $$\nThe matrix $(g_{ij})$ is an $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ matrix. Using the property $\\det(cA) = c^{k}\\det(A)$ for a $k \\times k$ matrix $A$:\n$$ \\det(g) = (r^{2})^{n-1} \\det((\\bar{g}_{ij})) = r^{2(n-1)} \\det(\\bar{g}) $$\nThe Riemannian volume density is $\\sqrt{\\det g}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\det g} = \\sqrt{r^{2(n-1)} \\det(\\bar{g})} = |r^{n-1}| \\sqrt{\\det(\\bar{g})} $$\nSince the radial coordinate $r \\geq 0$, we have $|r^{n-1}| = r^{n-1}$.\n$$ \\sqrt{\\det g} = r^{n-1} \\sqrt{\\det(\\bar{g})} $$\n\nFinally, we determine the function $J(r)$. The Riemannian volume element on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in these coordinates is:\n$$ d\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} = \\sqrt{\\det g} \\, dr \\, d\\theta^{1} \\dots d\\theta^{n-1} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\sqrt{\\det g}$:\n$$ d\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} = r^{n-1} \\sqrt{\\det(\\bar{g})} \\, dr \\, d\\theta^{1} \\dots d\\theta^{n-1} $$\nThe volume element for the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ with its induced metric $\\bar{g}$ is:\n$$ d\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\det(\\bar{g})} \\, d\\theta^{1} \\dots d\\theta^{n-1} $$\nBy rearranging the terms, we can express the volume element of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ as:\n$$ d\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} = (r^{n-1}) \\, dr \\, ( \\sqrt{\\det(\\bar{g})} \\, d\\theta^{1} \\dots d\\theta^{n-1} ) = r^{n-1} \\, dr \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} $$\nThe problem asks to find the function $J(r)$ in the decomposition $d\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} = J(r)\\,dr\\,d\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$.\nBy comparing our derived expression to this form, we identify:\n$$ J(r) = r^{n-1} $$\nThis expression gives the scaling factor for the volume element as a function of the radial distance $r$.

We need to show that the pullback metric $\\Phi^*g$ takes the form $dr^2 + f(r)^2 d\\theta^2$.\nThe coordinate vector fields associated with the $(r,\\theta)$ coordinates are $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$. The components of the pullback metric tensor are given by $g_{rr} = g(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r})$, $g_{r\\theta} = g(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta})$, and $g_{\\theta\\theta} = g(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta})$.\n\nThe curve $t \\mapsto \\Phi(t, \\theta_0)$ for a fixed $\\theta_0$ is the geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v(\\theta_0)$. By the definition of geodesic polar coordinates, the parameter $r$ is the arc length along this geodesic. This means the tangent vector $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}$ is a unit vector. Therefore, $g_{rr} = g(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}) = 1$.\n\nGauss's lemma states that for an exponential map, the radial geodesic vector field is orthogonal to the tangent vectors of the geodesic spheres (which are the level sets of the function $q \\mapsto d(p,q)$). In our coordinates, the radial vector field is $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}$, and the curves of constant $r$ (geodesic circles) have tangent vectors proportional to $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta}$. Thus, Gauss's lemma implies that $g(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta}) = 0$. This means $g_{r\\theta}=0$.\n\nThe metric tensor is therefore diagonal, and the line element has the form $ds^2 = dr^2 + g_{\\theta\\theta} \\,d\\theta^2$. By the rotational symmetry of the sphere around the pole $p$, the length of the vector $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta}$ can only depend on the distance $r$ from the pole, and not on the angle $\\theta$. Thus, we can write $g_{\\theta\\theta} = (f(r))^2$ for some non-negative function $f$. We have $\\Phi^*g = dr^2 + f(r)^2 d\\theta^2$.\n\nFor the metric expressed in these coordinates to correspond to a smooth metric on the manifold at the pole ($r=0$), it must be locally Euclidean. In the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{S}^2$, the standard Euclidean metric in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ is $dr^2+r^2d\\theta^2$. The metric on the manifold must approach this form as $r \\to 0$. This means we require $\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{f(r)^2}{r^2} = 1$. Since $f(r)$ is a length, we take the positive root, $\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{f(r)}{r} = 1$. L'Hôpital's rule can be applied if we assume $f$ is differentiable at $0$ and $f(0)=0$. The condition $\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{f(r)}{r} = f'(0) = 1$ requires $f(0)=0$. The smoothness of the metric ensures this is the case.\n\n2) To determine the explicit form of $f(r)$, we compare the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of a geodesic circle. Let $\\mathbb{S}^2$ be the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. Let $p$ be the north pole $(0,0,1)$. A geodesic starting at $p$ is a great circle. A point at a Riemannian distance $r$ from $p$ along a geodesic lies on a latitude circle. The angle subtended by the arc of length $r$ at the center of the sphere is $r$. The $z$-coordinate of this point is $z=\\cos r$. The set of all points at distance $r$ from $p$ forms the latitude circle defined by $z=\\cos r$. The radius $\\rho$ of this circle in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by $\\rho^2 = x^2+y^2 = 1-z^2 = 1-\\cos^2 r = \\sin^2 r$. So, $\\rho = \\sin r$ for $r \\in (0,\\pi)$. The extrinsic length of this circle is $L_{ext} = 2\\pi\\rho = 2\\pi \\sin r$.\n\nThe intrinsic length of this geodesic circle is calculated using the pullback metric $\\Phi^*g$. The curve is given by $r=\\text{constant}$, parameterized by $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Its length is $L_{int} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{g_{\\theta\\theta}} \\,d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{f(r)^2} \\,d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} f(r) \\,d\\theta = 2\\pi f(r)$, as $f(r) > 0$ for $r \\in (0,\\pi)$.\nEquating the two expressions for the length gives $2\\pi f(r) = 2\\pi \\sin r$, so $f(r) = \\sin r$. We can verify that $f(0)=\\sin(0)=0$ and $f'(r)=\\cos(r)$, so $f'(0)=\\cos(0)=1$, satisfying the conditions from part 1.\n\n3) The cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ of a point $p$ is the set of points $q$ for which there is more than one minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$. On the unit sphere, geodesics from the north pole $p$ are meridians. All meridians intersect at the south pole, which we can denote as $-p$. The length of each meridian from the north pole to the south pole is $\\pi$. For any point $q$ other than the south pole, there is a unique shortest great circle arc from $p$ to $q$. Thus, the cut locus of the north pole is the south pole: $\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$.\n\nThe polar coordinate map $\\Phi$ is defined for $r \\in (0,\\pi)$ and fails to be a diffeomorphism at $r=\\pi$, where it maps the entire circle of radius $\\pi$ in the tangent space to the single point $-p$. To illustrate the failure of unique covering for $r > \\pi$, consider the exponential map on the entire tangent space. A point $q = \\exp_p(s\\,v(\\theta))$ for $s \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ lies on the great circle determined by $v(\\theta)$. It has passed the south pole (at arc length $\\pi$) and is moving back toward the north pole. The distance of $q$ from the south pole is $s-\\pi$. The unique minimizing geodesic distance from the north pole to $q$ is $r' = \\pi - (s-\\pi) = 2\\pi - s$. Note that if $s \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, then $r' \\in (0, \\pi)$. The point $q$ lies on the \"opposite\" side of the sphere from the initial part of the geodesic, which corresponds to an angle of $\\theta+\\pi$. Thus, we have the relation\n$$ \\exp_p\\big(s\\,v(\\theta)\\big) = \\exp_p\\big((2\\pi-s)\\,v(\\theta+\\pi)\\big) \\quad \\text{for } s \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi) $$\nThis shows that a point described by coordinates $(s, \\theta)$ with $s > \\pi$ is identical to a point described by coordinates $(r', \\theta')$ with $r' \\in (0,\\pi)$, demonstrating the non-uniqueness. For instance, the pair $(r,\\theta) = (\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, 0)$ maps to the same point as $(r',\\theta') = (2\\pi - \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\pi) = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$.\n\n4) The Jacobian determinant $J(r)$ of the map $\\Phi$ relates the standard area element $dr \\wedge d\\theta$ on the domain to the Riemannian area form on $\\mathbb{S}^2$. The Riemannian area form $dA$ in these coordinates is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dr \\wedge d\\theta$.\nThe matrix of the metric tensor is $G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  f(r)^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its determinant is $\\det(G) = f(r)^2$.\nSo, $dA = \\sqrt{f(r)^2} \\, dr \\wedge d\\theta = |f(r)| \\, dr \\wedge d\\theta$.\nFrom part 2, $f(r) = \\sin r$. For $r \\in (0, \\pi)$, $\\sin r > 0$, so $|f(r)| = \\sin r$.\nThe Jacobian determinant is therefore $J(r) = \\sin r$.\nThe problem asks to evaluate $J(\\pi)$. Although the domain of $\\Phi$ is $(0,\\pi)$, the function $J(r)$ can be continuously extended to $r=\\pi$.\n$$ J(\\pi) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0 $$\nThe vanishing of the Jacobian at $r=\\pi$ reflects the geometric fact that the coordinate chart is degenerate there; the circle of radius $\\pi$ in the domain is mapped to a single point (the south pole) on the sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3047978"}, {"introduction": "Our final exercise unifies the previous examples by revealing a deep and universal principle: every Riemannian manifold is \"infinitesimally flat.\" Using the powerful tool of Jacobi fields, you will analyze the behavior of the metric for vanishingly small radii and prove that the geometry of a small geodesic sphere always mimics that of a sphere in flat tangent space [@problem_id:3048010].

It is computed by taking the derivative of the map $F$ with respect to $\\theta^i$:\n$$\nY_i(r) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^i} \\exp_p(r\\Theta(\\theta)) = d(\\exp_p)_{r\\Theta(\\theta)} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial\\Theta(\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta^i} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $d(\\exp_p)_v(w)$ denotes the differential of the exponential map at $v \\in T_pM$ applied to a vector $w \\in T_v(T_pM) \\cong T_pM$.\n\nThe vector field $Y_i(r)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma(r)$ is a Jacobi field. This is because it is the variation vector field of a family of geodesics. Consider the variation $\\alpha_s(r) = \\exp_p(r\\Theta(\\theta(s)))$, where $\\theta(s)$ is a curve in the angular coordinate domain $U$ with $\\theta(0)=\\theta$ and $\\frac{d\\theta^k}{ds}|_{s=0} = \\delta_i^k$. The variation field is $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_s(r)}{\\partial s}|_{s=0}$, which is precisely $Y_i(r)$. A Jacobi field $J(r)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(r)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(r) + R(J(r), \\dot{\\gamma}(r))\\dot{\\gamma}(r) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nTo analyze $Y_i(r)$ for small $r$, we determine its initial conditions at $r=0$.\nThe initial position is:\n$$\nY_i(0) = d(\\exp_p)_{0}\\left( 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial\\Theta}{\\partial\\theta^i} \\right) = 0\n$$\nsince it is the differential of a map applied to the zero vector.\nThe initial covariant derivative (velocity) is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}Y_i(0) = \\frac{D}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=0} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta^i} \\exp_p(r\\Theta(\\theta)) \\right) = \\frac{D}{d\\theta^i}\\bigg|_{\\theta} \\left( \\frac{d}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=0} \\exp_p(r\\Theta(\\theta)) \\right)\n$$\nThe order of differentiation can be swapped. The inner derivative is $\\frac{d}{dr}|_{r=0} \\exp_p(r\\Theta(\\theta)) = \\dot{\\gamma}(0) = \\Theta(\\theta)$. Thus,\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}Y_i(0) = \\frac{D}{d\\theta^i}\\bigg|_{\\theta} (\\Theta(\\theta)) = \\frac{\\partial\\Theta}{\\partial\\theta^i}\n$$\nwhere the covariant derivative in $T_pM$ is just the ordinary partial derivative since $T_pM$ is a vector space. Let's denote this initial velocity vector by $W_i = \\frac{\\partial\\Theta}{\\partial\\theta^i} \\in T_pM$.\n\nThe Jacobi field $Y_i(r)$ can be expressed via a Taylor series expansion in $r$ around $r=0$. If $P_{0,r}: T_pM \\to T_{\\gamma(r)}M$ is the parallel transport along $\\gamma$, the expansion is:\n$$\nY_i(r) = P_{0,r}\\left( Y_i(0) + r(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}Y_i)(0) + \\frac{r^2}{2}(\\nabla^2_{\\dot{\\gamma}}Y_i)(0) + O(r^3) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the initial conditions:\n$Y_i(0) = 0$\n$(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}Y_i)(0) = W_i$\nThe second derivative is found from the Jacobi equation: $(\\nabla^2_{\\dot{\\gamma}}Y_i)(r) = -R(Y_i(r), \\dot{\\gamma}(r))\\dot{\\gamma}(r)$.\nEvaluating at $r=0$:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2_{\\dot{\\gamma}}Y_i)(0) = -R_p(Y_i(0), \\dot{\\gamma}(0))\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = -R_p(0, \\Theta(\\theta))\\Theta(\\theta) = 0\n$$\nSo the Taylor series for $Y_i(r)$ starts as:\n$$\nY_i(r) = P_{0,r}( rW_i ) + O(r^3) = r P_{0,r}(W_i) + O(r^3)\n$$\nNow we can compute the metric coefficients $g_{ij}(r,\\theta)$:\n$$\ng_{ij}(r,\\theta) = g_{\\gamma(r)}(Y_i(r), Y_j(r)) = g_{\\gamma(r)}\\left( r P_{0,r}(W_i) + O(r^3), \\ r P_{0,r}(W_j) + O(r^3) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the inner product:\n$$\ng_{ij}(r,\\theta) = r^2 g_{\\gamma(r)}(P_{0,r}(W_i), P_{0,r}(W_j)) + O(r^4)\n$$\nParallel transport is an isometry, meaning it preserves the metric. Therefore, $g_{\\gamma(r)}(P_{0,r}(W_i), P_{0,r}(W_j)) = g_p(W_i, W_j)$.\nThis gives the leading order behavior of the metric coefficients:\n$$\ng_{ij}(r,\\theta) = r^2 g_p(W_i, W_j) + O(r^4)\n$$\nThis expression shows that $g_{ij}(r,\\theta)$ vanishes to second order as $r \\to 0$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the limit $L_{ij}(\\theta) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} r^{-2} g_{ij}(r,\\theta)$.\n$$\nL_{ij}(\\theta) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} r^{-2} \\left( r^2 g_p(W_i, W_j) + O(r^4) \\right) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left( g_p(W_i, W_j) + O(r^2) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nL_{ij}(\\theta) = g_p(W_i, W_j)\n$$\nSubstituting back the definition $W_i = \\frac{\\partial\\Theta(\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta^i}$:\n$$\nL_{ij}(\\theta) = g_p\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\Theta(\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta^i}, \\frac{\\partial\\Theta(\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta^j}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem statement provides the definition for the coefficients of the standard round metric on the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \\subset T_pM$ (induced by the inner product $g_p$ on $T_pM$) as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}(\\theta) = g_{p}\\!\\left(\\partial_{\\theta^{i}}\\Theta(\\theta),\\,\\partial_{\\theta^{j}}\\Theta(\\theta)\\right)\n$$\nBy direct comparison, we find that the limit is precisely these coefficients.\n$$\nL_{ij}(\\theta) = \\sigma_{ij}(\\theta)\n$$\nThis result is fundamental, stating that for small radii, the geometry of a constant-$r$ sphere on the manifold $M$ is infinitesimally identical to the geometry of the corresponding sphere in the flat tangent space $T_pM$. The curvature of the manifold $M$ only appears at the next order, in the $O(r^4)$ term of $g_{ij}$ which we did not need to compute. Gauss's lemma, which states $g_{ri}=0$, ensures the metric tensor is block-diagonal, and it is consistent with the properties of the Jacobi fields derived. Specifically, the initial velocity vector $W_i = \\partial_{\\theta^i}\\Theta$ is orthogonal to the radial direction vector $\\Theta$ in $T_pM$, i.e., $g_p(W_i, \\Theta)=0$. Gauss's lemma is the statement that this orthogonality is preserved along the geodesic, $g(Y_i(r), \\dot{\\gamma}(r))=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sigma_{ij}(\\theta)}$$", "id": "3048010"}]}
