We will proceed by addressing each part of the problem sequentially, starting from fundamental definitions.\n\nThe manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with its standard Euclidean metric $g$. In the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$, the metric tensor components are given by the inner product of the basis vectors, $g_{ij} = \\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, the Kronecker delta. These components are constant throughout the manifold.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Geodesic Equation**\n\nThe geodesic equation is $\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\gamma' = 0$, where $\\gamma(t)$ is a curve and $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. In local coordinates, this equation is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0\n$$\nfor each coordinate $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are defined by the metric tensor $g$ as:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{l=1}^{n} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $g^{kl}$ are the components of the inverse metric tensor. For the Euclidean metric, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, and its inverse is $g^{kl} = \\delta^{kl}$.\n\nSince the components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant for all $i,j$, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate $x^m$ are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^m} = \\frac{\\partial \\delta_{ij}}{\\partial x^m} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that every term in the parentheses is zero.\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\delta^{kl} \\left( 0 + 0 - 0 \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe Christoffel symbols are identically zero everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nSubstituting $\\Gamma^k_{ij}=0$ into the geodesic equation yields the following system of second-order ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad \\text{for } k=1, \\dots, n.\n$$\nThis is the geodesic equation in Cartesian coordinates for the Euclidean metric.\n\n**2. Solution of the Initial Value Problem and the Exponential Map**\n\nWe need to solve the geodesic equation subject to the initial conditions $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma'(0) = v \\in T_p \\mathbb{R}^n$. Let the curve be $\\gamma(t) = (x^1(t), \\dots, x^n(t))$.\n\nIntegrating the equation $\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0$ once with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dx^k}{dt} = c_k\n$$\nwhere $c_k$ are constants of integration. Integrating a second time gives:\n$$\nx^k(t) = c_k t + d_k\n$$\nwhere $d_k$ are also constants of integration. In vector notation, the solution is $\\gamma(t) = \\vec{c} t + \\vec{d}$.\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions. The point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ has coordinates $(p^1, \\dots, p^n)$, and the tangent vector $v \\in T_p \\mathbb{R}^n$ has components $(v^1, \\dots, v^n)$ in the basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}|_p\\}$.\nThe velocity vector of the curve is $\\gamma'(t) = \\vec{c}$, with components $\\frac{dx^k}{dt} = c_k$.\n\n-   At $t=0$, we have $\\gamma(0) = p$. This implies $x^k(0) = p^k$. From our general solution, $x^k(0) = c_k(0) + d_k = d_k$. Thus, $d_k = p^k$, or $\\vec{d} = p$.\n-   At $t=0$, we have $\\gamma'(0) = v$. This implies $\\frac{dx^k}{dt}(0) = v^k$. From our velocity calculation, $\\frac{dx^k}{dt}(t) = c_k$. Thus, $c_k = v^k$, or $\\vec{c} = v$.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the general solution, we obtain the unique geodesic satisfying the initial conditions:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = v t + p\n$$\nThe exponential map at $p$, $\\exp_p: T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, is defined by $\\exp_p(v) = \\gamma(1)$, where $\\gamma(t)$ is the geodesic with initial conditions $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=v$.\nSetting $t=1$ in our solution gives:\n$$\n\\exp_p(v) = \\gamma(1) = v(1) + p = p+v\n$$\n\n**3. Normal Coordinates**\n\nNormal coordinates at $p$ are defined by the coordinate chart $\\varphi = (\\exp_p)^{-1}$ on a neighborhood of $p$. A point $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is assigned coordinates $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$ if $q = \\exp_p(v)$, where the vector $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ has components $v^i = y^i$ in the standard basis at $p$.\n\nUsing our result for the exponential map, a point $q$ with normal coordinates $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$ is given by $q = p+y$, where $y$ is the vector with components $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$. If the Cartesian coordinates of $q$ are $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$, this relationship is $x^k = p^k + y^k$. This implies the normal coordinates of a point $q$ are given by $y^k = x^k - p^k$. This confirms that the normal coordinate system at $p$ is the standard Cartesian system translated so that $p$ becomes the origin.\n\nNow, we verify the properties of the metric and Christoffel symbols at $p$ (which is the origin $y=0$ in the normal coordinate system). The transformation from normal coordinates $y$ to Cartesian coordinates $x$ is $x^i(y) = y^i + p^i$. The Jacobian matrix of this transformation is $\\frac{\\partial x^i}{\\partial y^j} = \\delta^i_j$.\n\nThe metric components $\\tilde{g}_{ij}$ in the normal coordinate system are given by the transformation law:\n$$\n\\tilde{g}_{ij}(y) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^{n} g_{kl}(x(y)) \\frac{\\partial x^k}{\\partial y^i} \\frac{\\partial x^l}{\\partial y^j}\n$$\nSince $g_{kl}(x) = \\delta_{kl}$ and $\\frac{\\partial x^k}{\\partial y^i} = \\delta^k_i$, we have:\n$$\n\\tilde{g}_{ij}(y) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^{n} \\delta_{kl} \\delta^k_i \\delta^l_j = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThe metric components in normal coordinates are $\\tilde{g}_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ everywhere, not just at the origin. Therefore, at the point $p$ (which corresponds to $y=0$), the metric components are $g_{ij}(p) = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nTo find the Christoffel symbols $\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij}$ in normal coordinates, we use their definition with respect to the metric $\\tilde{g}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\tilde{g}^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}_{jl}}{\\partial y^i} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}_{il}}{\\partial y^j} - \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{g}_{ij}}{\\partial y^l} \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\tilde{g}_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant in the normal coordinate system, their partial derivatives are all zero. Consequently, $\\tilde{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$ and for all points in the chart. In particular, the Christoffel symbols vanish at $p$.\n\n**4. Normal Neighborhood**\n\nA normal neighborhood of $p$ is a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ on which the map $(\\exp_p)^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism and for any two points $q_1, q_2 \\in U$, the unique geodesic connecting them lies entirely within $U$. More specifically for a neighborhood of a single point $p$, it is an open set $U$ containing $p$ such that for every $q \\in U$, there exists a unique geodesic segment from $p$ to $q$ that is contained in $U$ and is minimizing.\n\nThe exponential map for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $\\exp_p: T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ given by $\\exp_p(v) = p+v$. This map is an affine translation, which is a global diffeomorphism. Its inverse is $(\\exp_p)^{-1}(q) = q-p$, which is also defined and smooth on all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nThis means that for any point $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a unique vector $v = q-p \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\exp_p(v) = q$. The geodesic from $p$ to $q$ is the straight line $\\gamma(t) = p + t(q-p)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, which is clearly the unique shortest path between $p$ and $q$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nSince $\\exp_p$ is a global diffeomorphism from $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we can take the normal neighborhood to be the entire manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The entire space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a normal neighborhood of any of its points $p$.\n\nThe final requested piece of information is the analytic expression for $\\exp_p(v)$. As derived in part 2, this is $p+v$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p+v}\n$$", "id": "3060753"}, {"introduction": "Having established the flat case, we now explore how normal coordinates behave in the presence of curvature.

The derivation will proceed in three steps: first, determining the explicit form of the exponential map; second, computing the pullback metric and its Taylor expansion; and third, deriving the expansion for the volume density.\n\n**Step 1: The Exponential Map**\n\nThe unit sphere $S^n$ is the submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ defined by $\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} (p_i)^2 = 1$. The north pole is the point $N = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$. The tangent space $T_N S^n$ is the set of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ orthogonal to the position vector of $N$. A vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is in $T_N S^n$ if $v \\cdot N = 0$, which implies its $(n+1)$-th component is $0$. We can thus identify $T_N S^n$ with $\\mathbb{R}^n$, where a coordinate vector $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ corresponds to the tangent vector $v = (x_1, \\dots, x_n, 0) \\in T_N S^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nGeodesics on the sphere $S^n$ starting from a point $P$ are great circles passing through $P$. A great circle is the intersection of $S^n$ with a $2$-dimensional plane through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. A unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $N$ with initial velocity $u \\in T_N S^n$ (where $|u|=1$) is described by the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t)N + (\\sin t)u$.\n\nThe exponential map $\\exp_N: T_N S^n \\to S^n$ is defined by $\\exp_N(x) = \\gamma_x(1)$, where $\\gamma_x(t)$ is the geodesic starting at $N$ with initial velocity $x$. For an arbitrary vector $x \\in T_N S^n$, let $r = |x|$ be its norm. The unit-speed geodesic in the direction of $x$ starts with velocity $u = x/r$. Its path is $\\gamma_u(t) = (\\cos t)N + (\\sin t)(x/r)$. The geodesic with initial velocity $x$ is $\\gamma_x(t) = \\gamma_u(rt) = (\\cos(rt))N + (\\sin(rt))(x/r)$.\nEvaluating at $t=1$, we get the expression for the exponential map:\n$$ \\exp_N(x) = (\\cos r)N + \\frac{\\sin r}{r} x $$\nLet $p(x) = \\exp_N(x)$ denote the point on $S^n$ corresponding to the normal coordinates $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. Substituting the vector representations $N=(0, \\dots, 0, 1)$ and $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n, 0)$, we obtain the coordinates of $p(x)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$:\n$$ p(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\sin r}{r}x_1, \\dots, \\frac{\\sin r}{r}x_n, \\cos r\\right) $$\nwhere $r = |x| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}$. The function $\\frac{\\sin r}{r}$ is understood as its limiting value $1$ at $r=0$.\n\n**Step 2: The Pullback Metric and its Expansion**\n\nThe metric $g$ in normal coordinates is the pullback of the standard round metric on $S^n$ via the map $p(x)$. Since the round metric on $S^n$ is induced by the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the components $g_{ij}(x)$ of the pullback metric are given by the inner products of the partial derivative vectors:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x_i}, \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x_j} \\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} $$\nA direct computation of these partial derivatives and inner products is cumbersome. A more insightful method uses polar coordinates on $T_N S^n$. The Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong T_N S^n$ can be written in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta^1, \\dots, \\theta^{n-1})$ as $dr^2 + r^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$, where $g_{S^{n-1}}$ is the standard metric on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$.\nThe metric on $S^n$ in geodesic polar coordinates $(\\psi, \\theta^1, \\dots, \\theta^{n-1})$ from the north pole $N$ is $d\\psi^2 + \\sin^2\\psi \\, g_{S^{n-1}}$. The radial distance $r$ in our normal coordinates is precisely the geodesic distance from $N$, so $\\psi = r$. The exponential map is an isometry on the radial lines, and it maps the spheres of radius $r$ in $T_N S^n$ to spheres of geodesic radius $\\psi=r$ on $S^n$.\nThe pullback metric $g$ is obtained by substituting $\\psi=r$ into the metric for $S^n$:\n$$ g = dr^2 + (\\sin^2 r) g_{S^{n-1}} $$\nTo express this in Cartesian coordinates $x_i$, we use the relations $dr^2 = \\left( d(\\sqrt{\\sum x_k^2}) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sum x_k dx_k}{r} \\right)^2 = \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2} dx^i dx^j$ and $r^2 g_{S^{n-1}} = \\sum (dx_i)^2 - dr^2 = (\\delta_{ij} - \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2})dx^i dx^j$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $g$:\n$$ g_{ij} dx^i dx^j = \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2} dx^i dx^j + \\frac{\\sin^2 r}{r^2} \\left(\\delta_{ij} - \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2}\\right) dx^i dx^j $$\nThis gives the metric components:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\frac{\\sin^2 r}{r^2} \\delta_{ij} + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sin^2 r}{r^2}\\right) \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2} $$\nTo find the Taylor expansion near $x=0$ (or $r=0$), we expand the coefficients.\nThe Taylor series for $\\sin r$ is $r - \\frac{r^3}{6} + \\frac{r^5}{120} - \\dots$.\nSo, $\\sin^2 r = \\left(r - \\frac{r^3}{6} + \\dots\\right)^2 = r^2 - 2 \\frac{r^4}{6} + \\dots = r^2 - \\frac{r^4}{3} + O(r^6)$.\nThe coefficient functions are:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2 r}{r^2} = 1 - \\frac{r^2}{3} + O(r^4) $$\n$$ 1 - \\frac{\\sin^2 r}{r^2} = \\frac{r^2}{3} + O(r^4) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $g_{ij}(x)$:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{3} + O(r^4)\\right) \\delta_{ij} + \\left(\\frac{r^2}{3} + O(r^4)\\right) \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2} $$\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{r^2}{3} \\delta_{ij} + \\frac{x_i x_j}{3} + O(|x|^4) $$\nReplacing $r^2$ with $|x|^2 = \\sum_k x_k^2$, we get the required expansion up to quadratic terms:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3} \\left(|x|^2 \\delta_{ij} - x_i x_j\\right) + O(|x|^4) $$\n\n**Step 3: The Volume Density Expansion**\n\nThe Riemannian volume density is $\\sqrt{\\det g(x)}$. The metric matrix $g(x)$ can be written as $g = I + H + O(|x|^4)$, where $I$ is the identity matrix ($\\delta_{ij}$) and $H$ is the matrix of quadratic terms, $H_{ij} = -\\frac{1}{3}(|x|^2 \\delta_{ij} - x_i x_j)$.\nFor a matrix $A = I + \\epsilon B$ where $\\epsilon$ is small, the determinant is $\\det(A) \\approx 1 + \\epsilon \\text{tr}(B)$. Here, the terms in $H$ are of order $|x|^2$, which is small near $x=0$. Thus, we can write:\n$$ \\det g(x) \\approx 1 + \\text{tr}(H) $$\nThe trace of $H$ is:\n$$ \\text{tr}(H) = \\sum_{i=1}^n H_{ii} = \\sum_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{3} \\left(|x|^2 \\delta_{ii} - x_i x_i\\right) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(|x|^2 - x_i^2\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{tr}(H) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n |x|^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \\right) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left( n|x|^2 - |x|^2 \\right) = -\\frac{n-1}{3} |x|^2 $$\nSo, the determinant of the metric is:\n$$ \\det g(x) = 1 - \\frac{n-1}{3} |x|^2 + O(|x|^4) $$\nNow, we find the Taylor expansion of the square root of this expression. Using the expansion $\\sqrt{1+u} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}u - \\frac{1}{8}u^2 + \\dots$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\det g(x)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{n-1}{3} |x|^2 + O(|x|^4)} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\frac{n-1}{3} |x|^2\\right) + O(|x|^4) $$\n$$ \\sqrt{\\det g(x)} = 1 - \\frac{n-1}{6} |x|^2 + O(|x|^4) $$\nThis is the desired expansion. The problem asks for the coefficient $C_n$ in $\\sqrt{\\det g(x)} = 1 + C_n |x|^2 + \\text{h.o.t.}$. By comparison, we find:\n$$ C_n = -\\frac{n-1}{6} $$\nThis result is consistent with the known formula for the volume density in normal coordinates on a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$, which is $(\\frac{\\sin r}{r})^{n-1}$, and also with expansions involving the Ricci tensor.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{n-1}{6}} $$", "id": "3060728"}, {"introduction": "Normal coordinates provide a beautifully simple local picture of a manifold, but this picture is inherently limited in its extent.

Differentiating this function with respect to $s$ and using the product rule for the covariant derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{ds}f(s) = \\left\\langle \\frac{D}{ds}J, \\gamma' \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle J, \\frac{D}{ds}\\gamma' \\right\\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, $\\frac{D}{ds}\\gamma' = 0$, so the second term vanishes.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{ds}f(s) = \\left\\langle \\frac{D}{ds}J, \\gamma' \\right\\rangle\n$$\nDifferentiating a second time:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{ds^2}f(s) = \\left\\langle \\frac{D^2}{ds^2}J, \\gamma' \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle \\frac{D}{ds}J, \\frac{D}{ds}\\gamma' \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{D^2}{ds^2}J, \\gamma' \\right\\rangle\n$$\nFrom the Jacobi equation, we can substitute $\\frac{D^2}{ds^2}J = - \\kappa \\left( J - \\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle \\gamma' \\right)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{ds^2}f(s) = \\left\\langle -\\kappa \\left( J - \\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle \\gamma' \\right), \\gamma' \\right\\rangle = -\\kappa \\left( \\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle - \\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle \\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nUsing $\\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle=1$ and the definition $f(s) = \\langle J(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{ds^2}f(s) = -\\kappa \\left( f(s) - f(s) \\cdot 1 \\right) = 0\n$$\nSo, $f(s)$ satisfies the ordinary differential equation $f''(s) = 0$, which has the general solution $f(s) = As + B$. We find the constants $A$ and $B$ from the initial conditions on $J$.\n$f(0) = \\langle J(0), \\gamma'(0) \\rangle = \\langle 0, \\gamma'(0) \\rangle = 0$. This implies $B=0$.\n$f'(0) = \\langle \\frac{D}{ds}J(0), \\gamma'(0) \\rangle = \\langle V, \\gamma'(0) \\rangle$. The problem states that this is $0$. This implies $A=0$.\nThus, $f(s) = 0$ for all $s$. This means $\\langle J(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle = 0$, so the Jacobi field $J(s)$ is always orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector.\n\nWith $\\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle = 0$, the Jacobi equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$\n\\frac{D^{2}}{ds^{2}}J + \\kappa J = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous vector differential equation. To solve it, we introduce a basis that is parallel-transported along $\\gamma$. Let $V(s)$ be the vector field along $\\gamma$ obtained by parallel transport of the initial velocity $V = \\frac{D}{ds}J(0)$, i.e., $V(0)=V$ and $\\frac{D}{ds}V(s)=0$. Note that since $\\langle V, \\gamma'(0) \\rangle = 0$ and parallel transport preserves inner products, we have $\\langle V(s), \\gamma'(s) \\rangle = 0$ for all $s$.\nLet's express $J(s)$ in the form $J(s) = h(s)V(s)$ for some scalar function $h(s)$. Substituting this into the simplified Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{ds}J(s) = \\frac{D}{ds}(h(s)V(s)) = h'(s)V(s) + h(s)\\frac{D}{ds}V(s) = h'(s)V(s)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{D^2}{ds^2}J(s) = \\frac{D}{ds}(h'(s)V(s)) = h''(s)V(s) + h'(s)\\frac{D}{ds}V(s) = h''(s)V(s)\n$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\nh''(s)V(s) + \\kappa h(s)V(s) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(h''(s) + \\kappa h(s))V(s) = 0\n$$\nIf $V \\neq 0$, then $V(s) \\neq 0$, so we must have $h''(s) + \\kappa h(s) = 0$. Since $\\kappa  0$, the general solution is $h(s) = C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s)$.\nWe use the initial conditions for $J(s)$ to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n$J(0) = h(0)V(0) = h(0)V = 0$. Since $V$ can be non-zero, we must have $h(0)=0$.\n$h(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1$. So, $C_1=0$.\nThis leaves $h(s) = C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s)$.\nThe first derivative is $\\frac{D}{ds}J(s) = h'(s)V(s) = (C_2\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s))V(s)$.\nAt $s=0$, we have $\\frac{D}{ds}J(0) = (C_2\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\cos(0))V(0) = C_2\\sqrt{\\kappa}V$. We are given $\\frac{D}{ds}J(0) = V$.\nSo, $C_2\\sqrt{\\kappa}V = V$. If $V \\neq 0$, we can conclude $C_2\\sqrt{\\kappa} = 1$, which gives $C_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$.\nIf $V=0$, then $J(s)$ is trivially zero. For a non-trivial Jacobi field, we must have $V \\neq 0$.\nThe function $h(s)$ is therefore $h(s) = \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s)}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$.\n\n1.  **Explicit solution for $J(s)$:**\n    The solution for the Jacobi field is\n    $$\n    J(s) = \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s)}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} V(s)\n    $$\n    where $V(s)$ is the parallel transport of the initial derivative $V = \\frac{D}{ds}J(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma(s)$.\n\n2.  **Characterization and location of the first conjugate point:**\n    A point $\\gamma(s_0)$ for $s_0  0$ is conjugate to $p=\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(s)$ with $J(0) = 0$ that also vanishes at $s_0$, i.e., $J(s_0)=0$.\n    For $J(s)$ to be non-trivial, we must start with $V \\neq 0$. This implies its parallel transport $V(s)$ is non-zero for all $s$.\n    We set $J(s_0) = 0$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s_0)}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} V(s_0) = 0\n    $$\n    Since $V(s_0) \\neq 0$ and $\\kappa  0$, this condition is satisfied if and only if $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}s_0) = 0$.\n    The solutions for $s_0  0$ are given by $\\sqrt{\\kappa}s_0 = k\\pi$ for any positive integer $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n    The values of $s_0$ are thus $s_0 = \\frac{k\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$.\n    The first conjugate point corresponds to the smallest positive value of $s_0$, which occurs for $k=1$. The distance along the geodesic to the first conjugate point is therefore $s = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$.\n\n3.  **Radius of the normal coordinate ball:**\n    The exponential map $\\exp_p: T_p M \\to M$ maps vectors in the tangent space at $p$ to points on the manifold. Specifically, $\\exp_p(v) = \\gamma_v(1)$, where $\\gamma_v$ is the geodesic with initial velocity $v$. The map fails to be a diffeomorphism on an open ball $B(0, R) \\subset T_p M$ if the image of some point in the ball is a conjugate point to $p$.\n    The set of conjugate points to $p$ is the set of points $\\exp_p(v)$ where $v$ is a critical point of $\\exp_p$. A point $v \\in T_p M$ is a critical point if and only if $q = \\exp_p(v)$ is conjugate to $p$ along the geodesic segment from $p$ to $q$.\n    From part 2, we found that for any unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma$ starting at $p$, the first conjugate point occurs at a distance $s = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$. Since the sectional curvature is constant, this distance is independent of the direction of the geodesic.\n    Therefore, for any vector $v \\in T_p M$ with length $\\|v\\| = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$, the point $\\exp_p(v)$ is conjugate to $p$.\n    The exponential map $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism from the open ball $\\{u \\in T_p M : \\|u\\|  R\\}$ onto its image as long as this ball contains no vectors $v$ for which $\\exp_p(v)$ is a conjugate point. This requires that the length $\\|u\\|$ of any vector in the ball is less than the distance to the first conjugate point.\n    Thus, we must have $R \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$. The largest possible radius $R$ for which $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism on the open ball of radius $R$ is precisely this minimal distance to a conjugate point.\n    The largest such radius is $R = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}}\n$$", "id": "3060723"}]}
