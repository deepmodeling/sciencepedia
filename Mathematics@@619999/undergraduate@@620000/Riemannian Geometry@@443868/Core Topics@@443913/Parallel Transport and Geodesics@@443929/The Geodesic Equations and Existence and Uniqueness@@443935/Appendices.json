The metric $g$ is induced by the standard dot product on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The line element $ds^2$ is given by\n$$ds^2 = (dx^1)^2 + (dx^2)^2 + (dx^3)^2$$\nThe components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ are the coefficients of this quadratic form. In a matrix representation, this is:\n$$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\delta_{ij}$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$ is numerically identical to $g_{ij}$. Since all metric components $g_{ij}$ are constant values, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate $x^k$ are zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} = 0 \\quad \\forall i,j,k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$\nThe Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by the metric through the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$. The formula for these symbols is:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the fact that all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero, we immediately find that all Christoffel symbols vanish:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 \\quad \\forall i,j,k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$\nA geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a curve that parallel transports its own tangent vector. This condition is expressed by the geodesic equation, which states that the covariant derivative of the tangent vector field $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ along the curve is zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. In local coordinates $x^k(t)$, this equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0$$\nfor each component $k=1, 2, 3$. Since we have established that $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$ in Euclidean space with standard coordinates, the geodesic equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2, 3$$\nThis is a system of three independent second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We can solve this system by integrating twice with respect to the parameter $t$. The first integration yields:\n$$\\frac{dx^k}{dt} = v^k$$\nwhere $v^k$ are constants of integration, representing the components of a constant velocity vector $v = (v^1, v^2, v^3)$. A second integration gives the general solution for the path:\n$$x^k(t) = v^k t + p^k$$\nwhere $p^k$ are another set of constants of integration, representing the components of an initial position vector $p = (p^1, p^2, p^3)$. The vector equation $\\gamma(t) = vt + p$ is the parametric equation of a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, the geodesics on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the Euclidean metric are precisely the straight lines.\n\nNext, we address the existence and uniqueness of geodesics. The geodesic equation is a system of second-order ODEs of the form $\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{F}(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\dot{\\mathbf{x}})$, where in this case $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}$. The fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem for ODEs (the Picard-LindelÃ¶f theorem) states that for any initial conditions of position $\\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0$ and velocity $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t_0) = \\mathbf{v}_0$, there exists a unique solution in a neighborhood of $t_0$, provided that $\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous in $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}$. In our case, $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{0}$, which is infinitely differentiable and thus globally Lipschitz. This guarantees the existence of a unique solution for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and any tangent vector $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists a unique geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ such that $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = v$. Our explicit solution $\\gamma(t) = vt + p$ confirms this.\n\nFurthermore, we must justify that these geodesics (straight lines) globally minimize the length functional. The length $L$ of a differentiable curve $\\gamma(t)$ from $t=a$ to $t=b$ is given by:\n$$L(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} \\, dt = \\int_a^b ||\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|| \\, dt$$\nLet $p = \\gamma(a)$ and $q = \\gamma(b)$ be two points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The vector connecting them is $q-p$. We can write this vector as the integral of the curve's velocity vector:\n$$q - p = \\int_a^b \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\, dt$$\nTaking the norm of both sides and applying the triangle inequality for integrals (a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), we get:\n$$||q - p|| = \\left\\| \\int_a^b \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\, dt \\right\\| \\leq \\int_a^b ||\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|| \\, dt = L(\\gamma)$$\nThe term on the left, $||q - p||$, is the standard Euclidean distance between $p$ and $q$, which is the length of the straight-line path between them. The inequality shows that the length of any curve $\\gamma$ connecting $p$ and $q$ is greater than or equal to the length of the straight-line path. Equality holds if and only if the vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ has a constant direction for all $t \\in [a,b]$, which is true only if $\\gamma$ is a straight line. Thus, the straight line is the unique shortest path between any two points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and therefore geodesics in Euclidean space are globally length-minimizing. The geodesic distance between two points is the standard Euclidean distance.\n\nFinally, we calculate the geodesic distance between the points $p=(1,-2,0)$ and $q=(3,1,4)$. Based on our conclusion, this is the Euclidean distance, which is the magnitude of the vector displacement $q-p$.\n$$q - p = (3 - 1, 1 - (-2), 4 - 0) = (2, 3, 4)$$\nThe geodesic distance $d(p,q)$ is the norm of this vector:\n$$d(p,q) = ||q-p|| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 9 + 16} = \\sqrt{29}$$\nThe final answer is the exact value $\\sqrt{29}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{29}}$$", "id": "3047705"}, {"introduction": "Having confirmed our methods in Cartesian coordinates, we now explore how the choice of coordinate system affects our calculations.

The geodesic equations form a system of second-order ODEs. To apply the standard existence and uniqueness theorem (Picard-LindelÃ¶f), we convert it to a first-order system. Let $u_1 = r$, $u_2 = \\dot{r}$, $u_3 = \\theta$, $u_4 = \\dot{\\theta}$. The system is:\n$$\n\\frac{du_1}{ds} = u_2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du_2}{ds} = u_1 u_4^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du_3}{ds} = u_4\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du_4}{ds} = -\\frac{2}{u_1} u_2 u_4\n$$\nThis system is of the form $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}} = F(\\mathbf{u})$. The function $F$ is defined by the right-hand sides. For any initial data with $r(0) = r_0 > 0$, we consider an open neighborhood where $r = u_1$ is bounded away from $0$. In such a neighborhood, the components of $F$ are continuously differentiable functions of $(u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4)$. A continuously differentiable function is locally Lipschitz. Therefore, by the Picard-LindelÃ¶f theorem, for any initial condition $(r(0), \\theta(0), \\dot{r}(0), \\dot{\\theta}(0))$ with $r(0) > 0$, there exists a unique solution (a unique local geodesic) passing through that point with the given initial velocity.\n\nAt $r=0$, the situation is different. The polar coordinate chart is singular at the origin. This manifests in the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{r}$, which are undefined at $r=0$. Consequently, the system of geodesic ODEs is singular at $r=0$. The function $F$ in the first-order system is undefined when $u_1=r=0$, so the Picard-LindelÃ¶f theorem cannot be applied directly in these coordinates. This is a coordinate singularity, not a singularity of the underlying manifold, which is the smooth Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$, the metric is $g=dx^2+dy^2$. All metric components are constant, so all Christoffel symbols are zero. The geodesic equations become $\\ddot{x}=0$ and $\\ddot{y}=0$. The solutions are $x(s) = as+b$ and $y(s) = cs+d$, which are straight lines. This system of ODEs is non-singular everywhere, and the existence and uniqueness of a geodesic through any point (including the origin) with any initial velocity are guaranteed. Thus, despite the coordinate singularity at $r=0$ in the polar representation, unique geodesics exist everywhere on the manifold.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -r & \\frac{1}{r} & \\frac{1}{r} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3071424"}, {"introduction": "The local existence and uniqueness of geodesics is a cornerstone of Riemannian geometry, but it relies on certain smoothness conditions of the metric.

Therefore, the metric $g_{\\alpha}$ is a $C^1$ metric, but not $C^2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the non-zero Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}(\\partial_i g_{lj} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$.\nThe non-zero first derivative of the metric is $\\partial_x g_{22} = g_{22}'(x) = 2\\phi(x)\\phi'(x)$.\nThe inverse metric has components $g^{11}=1$ and $g^{22}=1/\\phi(x)^2$.\n$$\n\\Gamma^1_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\n\\partial_2 g_{12} + \\partial_2 g_{11} - \\partial_1 g_{22}) = -\\frac{1}{2}g_{22}'(x) = -\\phi(x)\\phi'(x)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\Gamma^2_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_1 g_{22} + \\partial_2 g_{21} - \\partial_2 g_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}g_{22}'(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\phi(x)^2} (2\\phi(x)\\phi'(x)) = \\frac{\\phi'(x)}{\\phi(x)}\n$$\nThe geodesic equations are:\n1.  $x'' + \\Gamma^1_{22}(y')^2 = 0 \\implies x'' - \\phi(x)\\phi'(x)(y')^2 = 0$\n2.  $y'' + 2\\Gamma^2_{12}x'y' = 0 \\implies y'' + 2\\frac{\\phi'(x)}{\\phi(x)}x'y' = 0$\n\nNow, let's analyze the regularity of the Christoffel symbols.\n$\\Gamma^1_{22}(x) = -\\phi(x)\\phi'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}g_{22}'(x)$.\n$g_{22}'(x) = -h(x)^{-2}h'(x) = -h(x)^{-2}(-\\frac{2}{\\alpha+1}(\\alpha+1)\\,\\text{sign}(x)|x|^\\alpha) = 2h(x)^{-2}\\text{sign}(x)|x|^\\alpha$.\nSince $h(0)=1$, near $x=0$, $\\Gamma^1_{22}(x) \\approx -\\text{sign}(x)|x|^\\alpha$.\nA function $F(x)$ is locally Lipschitz at $x=0$ if the ratio $|F(x)-F(0)|/|x|$ is bounded as $x\\to 0$. Here, $F(x) = \\Gamma^1_{22}(x)$ and $F(0)=0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{|\\Gamma^1_{22}(x)|}{|x|} = \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{|-\\text{sign}(x)|x|^\\alpha|}{|x|} = \\lim_{x\\to 0} |x|^{\\alpha-1} = \\infty\n$$\nbecause $0 < \\alpha < 1 \\implies \\alpha-1 < 0$. Thus, $\\Gamma^1_{22}(x)$ is not locally Lipschitz at $x=0$. A similar argument shows $\\Gamma^2_{12}(x)$ is also not locally Lipschitz.\nThe geodesic equations form a second-order ODE system. Converted to a first-order system for $z=(x,y,x',y')$, the right-hand side involves the Christoffel symbols. Since they are not locally Lipschitz, the standard PicardâLindelÃ¶f theorem for uniqueness does not apply.\n\nSince the metric components do not depend on $y$ (i.e., $y$ is a cyclic coordinate), there is a conserved quantity associated with the Killing vector field $\\partial_y$. The conserved quantity is $p_y = g(\\gamma', \\partial_y) = g_{2j} (x^j)' = g_{22} y' = \\phi(x)^2 y'$.\nLet this constant be $L$. From the initial conditions $x(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=c_0 \\neq 0$, we find $L = \\phi(0)^2 y'(0) = 1^2 \\cdot c_0 = c_0$.\nSo, $\\phi(x(t))^2 y'(t) = c_0$, which gives $y'(t) = c_0/\\phi(x(t))^2$.\nSubstitute this into the first geodesic equation:\n$$\nx'' - \\phi(x)\\phi'(x) \\left(\\frac{c_0}{\\phi(x)^2}\\right)^2 = 0 \\implies x'' = c_0^2 \\frac{\\phi'(x)}{\\phi(x)^3}\n$$\nLet's simplify the term $\\phi'(x)/\\phi(x)^3$.\n$\\phi(x) = h(x)^{-1/2}$, so $\\phi'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}h(x)^{-3/2}h'(x)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi'(x)}{\\phi(x)^3} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}h(x)^{-3/2}h'(x)}{(h(x)^{-1/2})^3} = -\\frac{1}{2}h'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{2}{\\alpha+1}\\right)f'(x) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}(\\alpha+1)\\,\\text{sign}(x)|x|^{\\alpha} = \\text{sign}(x)|x|^{\\alpha}\n$$\nSo the ODE for $x(t)$ becomes:\n$$\nx''(t) = c_0^2\\,\\text{sign}(x)|x|^{\\alpha}\n$$\nwith initial conditions $x(0)=0$ and $x'(0)=0$. This is a second-order ODE of the form $x''=F(x)$, where $F(x) = c_0^2\\,\\text{sign}(x)|x|^{\\alpha}$. As shown before, the function $F(x)$ is continuous but not locally Lipschitz at $x=0$.\nOne trivial solution is $x(t) = 0$ for all $t$. This satisfies $x(0)=0, x'(0)=0$. For this solution, $y'(t) = c_0/\\phi(0)^2=c_0$, so $y(t) = c_0 t$ (since $y(0)=0$). This gives the geodesic $\\gamma_0(t) = (0, c_0 t)$, which is a $C^\\infty$ curve.\n\nHowever, non-uniqueness is possible. Let's construct other solutions. Consider $x > 0$, so $x'' = c_0^2 x^{\\alpha}$. A solution starting from rest at $t=t_0 \\ge 0$ is found to be of the form $x(t) = C (t-t_0)^{2/(1-\\alpha)}$ for $t \\ge t_0$. Because $0<\\alpha<1$, the exponent $p = 2/(1-\\alpha)$ is greater than $2$.\nThis implies that $x(t)$ is a $C^2$ function. Specifically, $x(t_0)=0, x'(t_0)=0, x''(t_0)=0$.\nWe can create a solution to our initial value problem by taking $x(t)=0$ for $t \\in [0, t_0]$ and $x(t) = C (t-t_0)^p$ for $t > t_0$. This function is $C^2$ for any choice of $t_0 \\ge 0$.\nBy choosing different values for $t_0 > 0$, we can generate infinitely many distinct $C^2$ solutions for $x(t)$ that satisfy the initial conditions $x(0)=0, x'(0)=0$. For each such solution $x(t)$, we get a corresponding $y(t)$ by integrating $y'(t) = c_0/\\phi(x(t))^2$. Since $x(t)$ is $C^2$ and $\\phi(x)$ is $C^1$, $y'(t)$ is $C^1$, and thus $y(t)$ is $C^2$. This means we have infinitely many distinct $C^2$ geodesics starting from $p=(0,0)$ with the same initial velocity $(x'(0),y'(0))=(0,c_0)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For $0<\\alpha<1$, the metric $g_{\\alpha}$ is $C^{1}$ but its Christoffel symbols fail to be locally Lipschitz near $x=0$, and there are infinitely many $C^{2}$ geodesics through $p$ with the same initial velocity $x'(0)=0$, $y'(0)\\neq 0$.**\n-   The metric $g_{\\alpha}$ is $C^1$: Correct, as shown above $g_{22}$ is $C^1$ but not $C^2$.\n-   Christoffel symbols fail to be locally Lipschitz: Correct, as shown by analyzing the behavior of their derivatives near $x=0$.\n-   There are infinitely many $C^2$ geodesics with the same initial data: Correct. We explicitly demonstrated the existence of such solutions by constructing them.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For $0<\\alpha<1$, the metric $g_{\\alpha}$ is $C^{1,1}$ (its first derivatives are locally Lipschitz), so the Christoffel symbols are locally Lipschitz and uniqueness holds for all geodesic initial data.**\n-   A function is $C^{1,1}$ if its first derivative is locally Lipschitz. This is essentially equivalent to its second derivative being locally bounded. We showed that $g_{22}''(x)$ is unbounded as $x\\to 0$. Therefore, $g_{22}$ is not $C^{1,1}$, and the metric $g_{\\alpha}$ is not $C^{1,1}$. The premise is false. Consequently, the conclusions that Christoffel symbols are Lipschitz and uniqueness holds are also false for this metric.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the metric $g_{\\alpha}$, the coordinate $y$ is cyclic (the metric components do not depend on $y$), which yields a conserved quantity reducing the geodesic equations to a first-order planar system in $(x,v)$, with $v=x'$, whose right-hand side fails to be locally Lipschitz in $x$ at $(x,v)=(0,0)$, thereby allowing non-unique geodesics with the same initial data.**\n-   $y$ is cyclic: Correct.\n-   Yields a conserved quantity: Correct, $\\phi(x)^2 y'$ is constant.\n-   Reduces to a first-order planar system in $(x,v)$: Correct, we derived the system $x'=v, v'=c_0^2 \\text{sign}(x)|x|^\\alpha$.\n-   RHS fails to be locally Lipschitz in $x$ at $(x,v)=(0,0)$: Correct. The function $F(x) = c_0^2\\,\\text{sign}(x)|x|^{\\alpha}$ is not Lipschitz at $x=0$. The initial conditions are $x=0, v=x'=0$.\n-   Allowing non-unique geodesics: Correct, this is the consequence of the failure of the Lipschitz condition.\nThis option provides a precise and accurate summary of the mechanism leading to non-uniqueness.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. The apparent failure of uniqueness for geodesics in $g_{\\alpha}$ is purely a coordinate artifact; in any coordinate chart, $C^{1}$ metric regularity suffices to guarantee uniqueness of geodesics.**\n-   The failure of uniqueness is a geometric fact, not a coordinate artifact. The existence of multiple distinct curves satisfying the geodesic property with the same starting point and initial velocity is an invariant statement.\n-   The claim that \"$C^1$ metric regularity suffices to guarantee uniqueness of geodesics\" is a false mathematical statement. This problem itself is a direct counterexample. The established sufficient condition for uniqueness is a $C^2$ metric (or more weakly, a $C^{1,1}$ metric).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If the metric had first derivatives that are locally Lipschitz (that is, $g\\in C^{1,1}$), then the Christoffel symbols would be locally Lipschitz and the PicardâLindelÃ¶f theorem would imply local uniqueness of geodesics for all initial conditions.**\n-   This is a conditional statement about a general principle.\n-   If $g \\in C^{1,1}$, its components $g_{ij}$ are $C^1$ and their first derivatives $\\partial_k g_{ij}$ are locally Lipschitz.\n-   $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are formed by sums and products of $g^{kl}$ (which are also $C^{1,1}$ and hence locally Lipschitz) and $\\partial_m g_{np}$ (which are locally Lipschitz by hypothesis). The sum and product of locally Lipschitz functions are locally Lipschitz. So, the Christoffel symbols would be locally Lipschitz.\n-   The geodesic equations, as a first-order system $z'(t) = F(z(t))$, have a right-hand side $F$ that is constructed from the Christoffel symbols and the velocity components. If the Christoffel symbols are locally Lipschitz, $F$ is locally Lipschitz in its arguments $(x,x')$.\n-   The PicardâLindelÃ¶f theorem then applies, guaranteeing local existence and uniqueness of solutions for any given initial conditions $(x(0), x'(0))$.\nThis statement is a correct theorem from the theory of differential equations applied to geometry.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3071400"}]}
