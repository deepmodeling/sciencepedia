It asks for a standard analysis of geodesics on the unit sphere, connecting the intrinsic definition to the properties in the ambient Euclidean space, and dealing with a coordinate singularity. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we analyze the curve $c$ and its relation to great circles and geodesics.\nThe curve $c:(0,\\pi)\\to S^2$ is defined in the spherical coordinate chart by $\\theta(t)=t$ and $\\phi(t)=0$. Substituting these into the coordinate map $F(\\theta,\\phi)=\\big(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi,\\ \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\ \\cos\\theta\\big)$, we obtain the explicit representation of the curve in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$:\n$$\nc(t) = F(t,0) = \\big(\\sin(t)\\cos(0),\\ \\sin(t)\\sin(0),\\ \\cos(t)\\big) = \\big(\\sin(t),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(t)\\big)\n$$\nfor $t \\in (0,\\pi)$.\nThe image of this curve is a set of points $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ where $x=\\sin(t)$, $y=0$, and $z=\\cos(t)$. The condition $y=0$ means the curve lies entirely in the $xz$-plane. The coordinates also satisfy $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (\\sin(t))^2 + 0^2 + (\\cos(t))^2 = 1$, confirming the curve lies on the unit sphere $S^2$.\nA great circle on $S^2$ is defined as the intersection of $S^2$ with a plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The $xz$-plane, defined by the equation $y=0$, is such a plane. Since the image of $c$ lies in the intersection of $S^2$ and the $xz$-plane, its image is an arc of a great circle.\n\nTo show that great circles are geodesics, we use the property that for a submanifold $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, a curve $\\gamma:I\\to M$ is a geodesic if and only if its acceleration vector in the ambient space, $\\ddot{\\gamma}(t)$, is everywhere normal to the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$. For the sphere $S^2$, the tangent space $T_pS^2$ at a point $p \\in S^2$ is the plane orthogonal to the position vector $p$. Thus, we must show that $\\ddot{\\gamma}(t)$ is parallel to $\\gamma(t)$ for any great circle $\\gamma$ parameterized by arc length.\n\nLet $\\gamma(s)$ be a curve tracing a great circle with unit speed, where $s$ is the arc length parameter. Such a curve can be written as $\\gamma(s) = \\cos(s) v_1 + \\sin(s) v_2$, where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orthonormal vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that span the plane of the great circle. Differentiating with respect to $s$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = -\\sin(s) v_1 + \\cos(s) v_2\n$$\nThe speed is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(s)\\| = \\sqrt{(-\\sin(s))^2 + (\\cos(s))^2} = 1$, so $s$ is indeed the arc length.\nDifferentiating again gives the acceleration vector:\n$$\n\\ddot{\\gamma}(s) = -\\cos(s) v_1 - \\sin(s) v_2 = -\\big(\\cos(s) v_1 + \\sin(s) v_2\\big) = -\\gamma(s)\n$$\nThe acceleration vector $\\ddot{\\gamma}(s)$ is equal to $-\\gamma(s)$, which is parallel to the position vector $\\gamma(s)$ and thus normal to the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}S^2$. The covariant derivative of the velocity field along the curve, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}$, is the projection of the ambient acceleration $\\ddot{\\gamma}$ onto the tangent space. Since $\\ddot{\\gamma}$ is entirely normal, its tangential projection is the zero vector. Therefore, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$, satisfying the geodesic equation. This demonstrates that all great circles, when parameterized by arc length, are geodesics on $S^2$. The curve $c(t)$ is an arc of such a great circle.\n\nSecond, we justify why the apparent termination is a coordinate artifact.\nIn the ambient space, the limits of the curve $c(t)$ as $t$ approaches the endpoints of its domain are:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} c(t) = \\big(\\sin(0),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(0)\\big) = (0,0,1) = N\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\pi^-} c(t) = \\big(\\sin(\\pi),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(\\pi)\\big) = (0,0,-1) = S\n$$\nThe curve smoothly approaches the North and South poles. The given spherical coordinate chart $F:(0,\\pi)\\times(-\\pi,\\pi)\\to S^2\\setminus\\{N,S\\}$ explicitly excludes the poles $N$ and $S$ from its range. The coordinate map $F$ is a diffeomorphism from its domain to its range, but it is not defined at the poles. At $\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$, the coordinate $\\phi$ becomes ill-defined, and the Jacobian matrix of the transformation from spherical to Cartesian coordinates becomes singular. This is a coordinate singularity. The manifold $S^2$ is itself a complete Riemannian manifold. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, any geodesic on a complete Riemannian manifold can be extended indefinitely. The inability to represent the curve for $t \\leq 0$ or $t \\geq \\pi$ within this specific chart is a limitation of the chart, not an intrinsic barrier to the geodesic's existence on the manifold. The geodesic itself continues smoothly through the poles.\n\nThird, we construct the smooth unit-speed extension $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to S^2$.\nThe expression for the curve in the ambient space is $c(t) = \\big(\\sin(t),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(t)\\big)$ for $t \\in (0,\\pi)$. This expression is well-defined and analytic for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We can therefore define the extended curve $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to S^2$ by this same formula:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\big(\\sin(t),\\ 0,\\ \\cos(t)\\big)\n$$\nWe verify that this curve satisfies the required properties:\n1.  **Smoothness:** The component functions $\\sin(t)$, $0$, and $\\cos(t)$ are infinitely differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\gamma(t)$ is a smooth curve.\n2.  **Lies on $S^2$:** For any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the norm is $\\|\\gamma(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(\\sin(t))^2 + 0^2 + (\\cos(t))^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The curve lies on the unit sphere for all $t$.\n3.  **Unit-speed:** The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\big(\\cos(t),\\ 0,\\ -\\sin(t)\\big)$. Its magnitude is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(\\cos(t))^2 + 0^2 + (-\\sin(t))^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The curve is parameterized by arc length. The parameter $t$ is indeed the angle in radians as stated.\n4.  **Extension of $c$:** For $t \\in (0,\\pi)$, the expression for $\\gamma(t)$ is identical to that of $c(t)$.\n\nThe curve $\\gamma(t)$ is a smooth, unit-speed, periodic curve with period $2\\pi$ that continuously traces and retraces the great circle in the $xz$-plane. It passes through the north pole $N=(0,0,1)$ at $t=2k\\pi$ and the south pole $S=(0,0,-1)$ at $t=(2k+1)\\pi$ for any integer $k$.

The curve is given by $\\gamma(t)=(\\cos t, \\sin t, 0)$, which traces the equator of $S^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we establish that $\\gamma(t)$ is a unit-speed geodesic. A geodesic on a sphere is a great circle. The curve $\\gamma(t)$ lies in the plane $z=0$, which passes through the origin $(0,0,0)$, and on the sphere $S^{2}$. The intersection of a plane through the origin with the sphere is a great circle. Thus, $\\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic.\nTo verify its speed, we compute the velocity vector:\n$$ \\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\cos t, \\sin t, 0) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 0) $$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this vector:\n$$ \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(-\\sin t)^2 + (\\cos t)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t} = 1 $$\nSince the speed is constant and equal to $1$, $\\gamma(t)$ is a unit-speed geodesic.\n\nThe length of the curve segment $\\gamma|_{[s,t]}$ from $\\gamma(s)$ to $\\gamma(t)$ is given by the integral of its speed over the parameter interval $[s, t]$:\n$$ L(\\gamma|_{[s,t]}) = \\int_{s}^{t} \\|\\gamma'(\\tau)\\| d\\tau = \\int_{s}^{t} 1 d\\tau = t-s $$\n\nFor this segment to be length-minimizing, its length must be equal to the Riemannian distance $d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t))$ between its endpoints. On a unit sphere, the Riemannian distance between two points $p, q \\in S^2$ is the length of the shorter great circle arc connecting them. This length is equal to the angle (in radians) between the position vectors (from the origin) of $p$ and $q$. If $p$ and $q$ are represented by unit vectors, this angle is given by $\\arccos(p \\cdot q)$.\n\nThe endpoints of our curve segment are $p = \\gamma(s) = (\\cos s, \\sin s, 0)$ and $q = \\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, 0)$. The Riemannian distance is:\n$$ d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)) = \\arccos(\\gamma(s) \\cdot \\gamma(t)) $$\nWe compute the dot product:\n$$ \\gamma(s) \\cdot \\gamma(t) = (\\cos s)(\\cos t) + (\\sin s)(\\sin t) + (0)(0) = \\cos(t-s) $$\nTherefore, the distance is:\n$$ d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)) = \\arccos(\\cos(t-s)) $$\nThe condition that the curve segment realizes the distance is $L(\\gamma|_{[s,t]}) = d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t))$, which translates to:\n$$ t-s = \\arccos(\\cos(t-s)) $$\nThe function $\\arccos(x)$ is defined with a principal value range of $[0, \\pi]$. The equality $\\theta = \\arccos(\\cos \\theta)$ holds if and only if $\\theta$ is in this range, i.e., $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$. In our case, $\\theta = t-s$.

The maximum value of $t-s$ is therefore $T-0 = T$.\nFor the condition $t-s \\leq \\pi$ to be satisfied for all $0 \\leq s  t \\leq T$, the maximum possible value of $t-s$ must be less than or equal to $\\pi$. Thus, we must have:\n$$ T \\leq \\pi $$\nThe problem asks for the largest such $T$. This is $T=\\pi$.\n\nLet's check this result. If $T = \\pi$, then for any $0 \\leq s  t \\leq \\pi$, the length of the segment is $t-s$. The maximum value of $t-s$ is $\\pi-0=\\pi$, so $0  t-s \\leq \\pi$ always holds. Therefore, the segment is always length-minimizing.\nIf we choose any $T'  \\pi$, we can select $s=0$ and $t=T'$. Then $t-s = T'  \\pi$.

No flaws are identified, so the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the problem. A geodesic is a curve $\\gamma(t)$ that is a stationary point of the energy functional $E(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)) dt$. The Euler-Lagrange equations derived from this functional describe the geodesics. The Lagrangian $L$ for a curve $\\gamma(t) = (r(t), \\theta(t))$ in the given metric is:\n$$L(r, \\theta, \\dot{r}, \\dot{\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\alpha}(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ r^{2\\alpha} \\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2\\alpha} r^{2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ r^{2\\alpha} \\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2} \\right]$$\nwhere $\\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{dt}$ and $\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$.\n\nThe geodesic equations are the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q^{i}} = 0 $$\nfor coordinates $q^i \\in \\{r, \\theta\\}$.\n\nFor the coordinate $\\theta$, the Lagrangian $L$ does not depend explicitly on $\\theta$, so $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. This implies a conservation law:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\text{constant} $$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\dot{\\theta}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = r^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta} $$\nThus, there exists a constant $C$ such that $r(t)^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}(t) = C$ for all $t$ along the geodesic.\n\nWe now apply the initial conditions. The geodesic starts at $\\gamma(0) = (r_0, \\theta_0)$. The initial velocity is \"purely radial inward\". In polar coordinates, a radial velocity vector has a zero component in the $\\theta$ direction. Thus, $\\dot{\\theta}(0) = 0$.\nEvaluating the constant $C$ at $t=0$:\n$$ C = r(0)^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}(0) = r_{0}^{2\\alpha+2} \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nSince $C=0$ for all time, we have $r(t)^{2\\alpha+2} \\dot{\\theta}(t) = 0$. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is defined on the manifold $M$ where $r(t)  0$. As $\\alpha  0$, the term $r(t)^{2\\alpha+2}$ is non-zero.
