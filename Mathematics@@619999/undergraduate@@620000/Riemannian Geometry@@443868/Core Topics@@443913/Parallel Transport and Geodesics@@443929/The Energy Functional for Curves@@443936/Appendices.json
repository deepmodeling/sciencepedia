Let's call this Euclidean energy $E_0(\\gamma)$. The squared Euclidean speed is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g_0}^2 = \\dot{x}(t)^2 + \\dot{y}(t)^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 = 5$, which is constant. The Euclidean energy is therefore:\n$$\nE_0(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} 5 \\,dt = \\frac{5}{2}.\n$$\nThe relationship between the metric $g$ and the Euclidean metric $g_0$ is $g = e^{2f}g_0$. The term $e^{2f}$ is the conformal factor. This factor locally scales the geometry. The squared speed of $\\gamma$ with respect to the metric $g$ is related to its squared Euclidean speed by this factor:\n$$\n\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_g^2 = g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t),\\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = e^{2f(\\gamma(t))}(\\dot{x}(t)^2+\\dot{y}(t)^2) = e^{2f(\\gamma(t))}\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g_0}^2.\n$$\nSo, the speed itself is scaled by $e^f$: $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_g = e^{f(\\gamma(t))}\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g_0}$. The conformal factor $e^{f}$ acts as a position-dependent scaling on the length of tangent vectors.\n\nIn essence, the conformal factor $e^{2f}$ re-weights the contribution of the curve's squared Euclidean speed at each point. In the Euclidean case, this weight is implicitly $1$ everywhere, so the energy is simply $\\frac{1}{2}$ the constant squared speed multiplied by the length of the parameter interval. In our problem, the weight is $e^{2f(\\gamma(t))} = e^{10t}$. This weight is not constant; it increases as $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$.\nAt the starting point $p=(0,0)$ (where $t=0$), the factor is $e^{0}=1$, so the local geometry is identical to the Euclidean one.\nAs the curve progresses towards $q=(1,2)$ (where $t=1$), the weighting factor $e^{10t}$ increases exponentially, reaching $e^{10}$ at the endpoint. This means the metric considers infinitesimal displacements to be progressively \"longer\" (by a factor of $e^{5t}$) along the path. Consequently, moving along the curve requires progressively more \"energy\". The total energy $E(\\gamma)$ is the integral of this weighted squared speed (divided by $2$), which results in a value $\\frac{1}{4}(e^{10}-1) \\approx 5506.4$, a value substantially larger than the Euclidean energy of $E_0(\\gamma)=2.5$.
