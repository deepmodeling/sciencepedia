We must validate the problem, and if valid, provide a reasoned solution.\n\nThe problem statement is well-defined, mathematically and scientifically sound, and internally consistent. It poses a standard, illustrative problem in Riemannian geometry concerning the relationship between metric completeness and geodesic completeness as described by the Hopf–Rinow theorem. All necessary definitions and data are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe three tasks are addressed in order.\n\nFirst, we justify that the curve $\\gamma : [0, \\sqrt{2}) \\to M$ given by $\\gamma(t) = (\\sqrt{2} - t, 0)$ is a geodesic in $M$ and that it is minimizing between any two of its points.\n\nA curve $\\gamma(t) = (x^1(t), x^2(t))$ is a geodesic if its components satisfy the geodesic equations:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{2} \\Gamma_{ij}^k \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1,2 $$\nwhere $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. The manifold $M$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and is endowed with the restriction of the standard Euclidean metric. For the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero, i.e., $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$ for all $i,j,k$. Consequently, the geodesic equations simplify to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1,2 $$\nThe given curve is $\\gamma(t) = (\\sqrt{2} - t, 0)$. Its components are $x^1(t) = \\sqrt{2} - t$ and $x^2(t) = 0$.\nThe first derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{dx^1}{dt} = -1, \\quad \\frac{dx^2}{dt} = 0 $$\nThe second derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 x^1}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2 x^2}{dt^2} = 0 $$\nBoth geodesic equations are satisfied, so $\\gamma$ is a geodesic. We must also confirm that its image lies in $M$. For any $t \\in [0, \\sqrt{2})$, the first component $\\sqrt{2}-t$ is in the interval $(0, \\sqrt{2}]$. The second component is $0$. Thus, $\\gamma(t) \\in M$ for all $t$ in its domain, as it never reaches the puncture at $(0,0)$.\n\nTo justify that $\\gamma$ is minimizing between any two of its points, let $t_1, t_2 \\in [0, \\sqrt{2})$ with $t_1 < t_2$. The points are $p_1 = \\gamma(t_1) = (\\sqrt{2}-t_1, 0)$ and $p_2 = \\gamma(t_2) = (\\sqrt{2}-t_2, 0)$. The portion of the curve $\\gamma$ between $t_1$ and $t_2$ is the straight line segment connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$. In Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the shortest path between any two points is the unique straight line segment connecting them. Since this segment lies entirely on the positive $x$-axis, it is fully contained within the manifold $M$. As the metric on $M$ is induced from $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this path must also be the shortest path within $M$. Therefore, $\\gamma$ is a minimizing geodesic between any two of its points.\n\nSecond, we compute the arclength $L$ of $\\gamma$ as it approaches the puncture.\nThe length is given by $L = \\lim_{b \\to \\sqrt{2}^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\| \\, dt$.\nThe velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = (\\frac{d}{dt}(\\sqrt{2} - t), \\frac{d}{dt}(0)) = (-1, 0)$.\nThe norm (speed) is calculated using the Euclidean metric:\n$$ \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$\nThe speed is constant. Now we compute the integral and the limit:\n$$ L = \\lim_{b \\to \\sqrt{2}^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} 1 \\, dt = \\lim_{b \\to \\sqrt{2}^{-}} [t]_{0}^{b} = \\lim_{b \\to \\sqrt{2}^{-}} (b - 0) = \\sqrt{2} $$\nThe arclength of the geodesic from $t=0$ up to the limit point is finite and equals $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThird, we explain the implications of this finite length in the context of the Hopf–Rinow theorem.\nThe Hopf–Rinow theorem establishes the equivalence of several properties for a connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, including:\n1.  $(M,g)$ is geodesically complete (every geodesic can be extended to be defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n2.  The metric space $(M,d)$ is complete (every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in $M$).\n3.  Closed and bounded subsets of $M$ are compact.\n\nOur geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is defined on the interval $[0, \\sqrt{2})$. As $t \\to \\sqrt{2}^{-}$, the point $\\gamma(t)$ approaches $(0,0)$, which is not in $M$. Therefore, the geodesic $\\gamma$ cannot be extended to a parameter value of $t = \\sqrt{2}$ or beyond, because its extension would leave the manifold. This means $\\gamma$ is a maximal geodesic defined on an interval that is not all of $\\mathbb{R}$. The existence of such a geodesic proves by definition that the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete.\n\nThe finiteness of the length $L=\\sqrt{2}$ is crucial. It shows that one can travel along a straight path for a finite distance and \"fall out\" of the space. If the length were infinite, the inability to extend the geodesic would not be a sign of incompleteness in the same way.\n\nBy the Hopf–Rinow theorem, since $M$ is geodesically incomplete, it must also be a metrically incomplete space. We can verify this directly. Consider the sequence of points $p_n = \\gamma(\\sqrt{2} - 1/n) = (1/n, 0)$ for integers $n \\geq 1$. This is a sequence of points in $M$. The distance between two points in the sequence is $d(p_n, p_m) = |1/n - 1/m|$, which approaches $0$ as $n, m \\to \\infty$. Thus, $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M,d)$. However, this sequence converges to $(0,0)$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $(0,0) \\notin M$. Therefore, the Cauchy sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ does not have a limit point in $M$. This directly demonstrates that $M$ is not a complete metric space.\n\nIn summary, the finite-length geodesic $\\gamma$ running into the puncture at the origin is the geometric manifestation of the metric incompleteness of the punctured plane.\nThe computed arclength is $L = \\sqrt{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$$", "id": "3047100"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to an incomplete space, we now turn our attention to the sphere, the quintessential example of a complete Riemannian manifold.

Do not use any pre-stated spherical distance formulas; derive the result from the definitions and arguments above.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and will be addressed in three parts as requested, based on the provided definitions and the Hopf-Rinow theorem.\n\nStep 1: Justification of Geodesic Completeness of $(S^{2}_{R}, g)$\n\nThe problem requires us to justify that the sphere $(S^{2}_{R}, g)$ is geodesically complete by first verifying that it is metrically complete. The Hopf-Rinow theorem states that for a connected Riemannian manifold, metric completeness and geodesic completeness are equivalent.\n\nThe sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ is defined as the set of points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that $\\|x\\| = R$ for a fixed $R > 0$. As a topological space, $S^{2}_{R}$ inherits its topology as a subspace of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We first consider the completeness of $S^{2}_{R}$ as a metric space with the distance $d_{Euc}$ induced by the Euclidean norm on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nBy the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\n- The sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ is bounded because for any point $x \\in S^{2}_{R}$, its Euclidean norm is $\\|x\\| = R$, so all points lie within a ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin.\n- The sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ is closed. Consider the function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = \\|x\\|^2 = x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} + x_{3}^{2}$. This function is continuous. The sphere is the preimage of the closed set $\\{R^2\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ under $f$, i.e., $S^{2}_{R} = f^{-1}(\\{R^2\\})$. The preimage of a closed set under a continuous function is closed.\n\nTherefore, $S^{2}_{R}$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which means it is compact with respect to the Euclidean topology. A fundamental theorem in metric spaces states that any compact metric space is complete. Thus, $(S^{2}_{R}, d_{Euc})$ is a complete metric space.\n\nNext, we must relate this to completeness with respect to the Riemannian distance $\\mathrm{dist}_{g}$. The Riemannian distance $\\mathrm{dist}_{g}(x, y)$ between two points $x, y \\in S^{2}_{R}$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves on $S^{2}_{R}$ connecting $x$ and $y$. The length of any curve is always greater than or equal to the straight-line Euclidean distance (the chord length) between its endpoints. Thus, for any $x, y \\in S^{2}_{R}$, we have the inequality:\n$$d_{Euc}(x,y) \\le \\mathrm{dist}_{g}(x,y)$$\nThis implies that the identity map $id: (S^{2}_{R}, \\mathrm{dist}_{g}) \\to (S^{2}_{R}, d_{Euc})$ is continuous. Because $S^{2}_{R}$ is compact, it can be shown that the two metrics $\\mathrm{dist}_{g}$ and $d_{Euc}$ induce the same topology on $S^{2}_{R}$. This means that a sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ in $S^{2}_{R}$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to $\\mathrm{dist}_{g}$ if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence with respect to $d_{Euc}$.\n\nLet $\\{x_n\\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $(S^{2}_{R}, \\mathrm{dist}_{g})$. Since the topologies are equivalent, $\\{x_n\\}$ is also a Cauchy sequence in $(S^{2}_{R}, d_{Euc})$. As we have established that $(S^{2}_{R}, d_{Euc})$ is complete, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ must converge to a limit $x_{\\infty} \\in S^{2}_{R}$ in the Euclidean metric. Again, because the topologies are the same, convergence in the Euclidean metric implies convergence in the Riemannian metric. Thus, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to $x_{\\infty}$ in $(S^{2}_{R}, \\mathrm{dist}_{g})$.\n\nSince every Cauchy sequence in $(S^{2}_{R}, \\mathrm{dist}_{g})$ converges to a point within the space, the metric space $(S^{2}_{R}, \\mathrm{dist}_{g})$ is complete. Finally, $S^{2}_{R}$ is a connected Riemannian manifold. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, its metric completeness implies its geodesic completeness.\n\nStep 2: Geodesics on the Sphere\n\nA curve $\\gamma(t)$ on a submanifold $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a geodesic if its acceleration vector $\\gamma''(t)$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is always orthogonal to the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$. For the sphere $S^{2}_{R}$, the tangent space $T_{x}S^{2}_{R}$ at a point $x$ is the plane through the origin orthogonal to the position vector $x$. Therefore, the condition for a curve $\\gamma(t)$ on $S^{2}_{R}$ to be a geodesic is that its acceleration vector $\\gamma''(t)$ must be parallel to its position vector $\\gamma(t)$ for all $t$.\n\nA great circle on $S^{2}_{R}$ is the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Let $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for such a plane. A curve parameterizing this great circle can be written as:\n$$\\gamma(t) = R(\\cos(at)u_1 + \\sin(at)u_2)$$\nfor some constant $a \\neq 0$. The velocity vector is:\n$$\\gamma'(t) = Ra(-\\sin(at)u_1 + \\cos(at)u_2)$$\nThe acceleration vector is:\n$$\\gamma''(t) = -Ra^2(\\cos(at)u_1 + \\sin(at)u_2) = -a^2 \\gamma(t)$$\nThe acceleration vector $\\gamma''(t)$ is a scalar multiple of the position vector $\\gamma(t)$. Since the position vector is normal to the sphere at $\\gamma(t)$, the acceleration is normal to the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^{2}_{R}$. Thus, great circles are geodesics.\n\nNow, consider the geodesics connecting a point $p \\in S^{2}_{R}$ to its antipode $-p$. A geodesic between these two points must be a segment of a great circle. For a great circle to pass through both $p$ and $-p$, the plane defining it must contain both points. Since $p$ and $-p$ are collinear with the origin, any plane containing the line passing through $p$, $0$, and $-p$ will define such a great circle. There is a one-parameter family of such planes, corresponding to rotation around the axis defined by the vector $p$. Each of these distinct planes defines a distinct great circle passing through $p$ and $-p$. Consequently, there are infinitely many distinct geodesics connecting $p$ and $-p$.\n\nEach of these geodesics is a semi-circle of the great circle. The length of any such semi-circle is half the circumference of the great circle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi R) = \\pi R$. Since all these geodesic paths from $p$ to $-p$ have the same length, they are all minimizing geodesics. The existence of at least one such minimizing geodesic is guaranteed by the Hopf-Rinow theorem on the complete manifold $S^{2}_{R}$.\n\nThe set of these minimizing geodesics can be characterized by the initial tangent direction at $p$. For any unit tangent vector $v \\in T_pS^2_R$, there exists a unique geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v$. As shown in the next step, every such geodesic reaches the antipode $-p$. Thus, the set of all minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all unit tangent vectors at $p$, which is a circle $S^{1}$ in the tangent plane $T_pS^2_R$.\n\nStep 3: Computation of the Riemannian Distance $\\mathrm{dist}_{g}(p, -p)$\n\nTo compute the distance, we construct a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ connecting $p$ to $-p$ and calculate its length. Let $p \\in S^{2}_{R}$ be the starting point. Let $v \\in T_pS^2_R$ be any tangent vector at $p$ with unit norm, i.e., $\\|v\\|=1$. The vector $v$ is orthogonal to $p$, so $p \\cdot v = 0$.\n\nLet $u_1 = p/R$ and $u_2 = v$. The vectors $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$ form an orthonormal set in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. A unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v$ is given by:\n$$\\gamma(t) = p \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) + (Rv) \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) = R u_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) + R u_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right)$$\nWe verify its properties. At $t=0$, $\\gamma(0) = R u_1 = p$.\nThe velocity is $\\gamma'(t) = -u_1 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) + u_2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right)$.\nAt $t=0$, the initial velocity is $\\gamma'(0) = u_2 = v$.\nThe speed is $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 = \\|-u_1 \\sin(t/R) + u_2 \\cos(t/R)\\|^2 = \\|u_1\\|^2 \\sin^2(t/R) + \\|u_2\\|^2 \\cos^2(t/R) = 1$, since $u_1, u_2$ are orthonormal. Thus, $\\gamma(t)$ is a unit-speed geodesic.\n\nWe want to find the time $t > 0$ at which this geodesic reaches the antipodal point $-p = -R u_1$. We set $\\gamma(t) = -p$:\n$$R u_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) + R u_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) = -R u_1$$\nDividing by $R$ and rearranging gives:\n$$u_1 \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right)+1\\right) + u_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) = 0$$\nSince $u_1$ and $u_2$ are linearly independent, their coefficients must be zero:\n$$\\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) + 1 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) = -1$$\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{R}\\right) = 0$$\nThe smallest positive value of $t$ that satisfies both equations is when the argument $t/R = \\pi$. Thus, $t = \\pi R$.\n\nThe Riemannian distance $\\mathrm{dist}_{g}(p, -p)$ is the length of a minimizing geodesic. The length $L$ of our unit-speed geodesic path from $t=0$ to $t=\\pi R$ is:\n$$L(\\gamma) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi R} \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| dt = \\int_{0}^{\\pi R} 1 dt = \\pi R$$\nSince we argued that all geodesics connecting $p$ and $-p$ have this length, and the Hopf-Rinow theorem guarantees that the distance is realized by such a geodesic, this length is the Riemannian distance.\n\nTherefore, the Riemannian distance between any point $p$ and its antipode $-p$ on the sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ is $\\pi R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi R}$$", "id": "3047163"}, {"introduction": "Our final exercise moves beyond simple topological holes and delves into a more subtle cause of incompleteness arising from the metric structure itself.

Therefore, we also conclude that the manifold $(M,g)$ is metrically incomplete.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{r_0}\n$$", "id": "3045287"}]}
