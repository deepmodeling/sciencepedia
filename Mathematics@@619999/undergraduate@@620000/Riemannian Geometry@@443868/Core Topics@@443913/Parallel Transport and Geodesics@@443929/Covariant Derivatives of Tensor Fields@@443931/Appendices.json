The failure of tensoriality for $\\Gamma^{i}{}_{jk}$ is due to the inhomogeneous transformation term, not merely metric dependence. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\nD. From the transformation law, the inhomogeneous term depends only on the coordinate change, not on the specific connection. Hence, for two connections with coefficients $\\Gamma$ and $\\tilde{\\Gamma}$, the difference $\\Gamma^{i}{}_{jk} - \\tilde{\\Gamma}^{i}{}_{jk}$ transforms homogeneously as a type $(1,2)$ tensor. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nE. In normal coordinates at a point (for an affine connection, including the Levi-Civita connection), one can arrange $\\Gamma^{i}{}_{jk} = 0$ at that point. If $\\Gamma^{i}{}_{jk}$ were tensor components, vanishing at a point in one coordinate system would imply vanishing at that point in all coordinate systems.
