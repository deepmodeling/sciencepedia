A curve on the surface is called **autoparallel** if its tangent vector remains parallel to itself when transported along the curve with respect to the sphere's intrinsic geometry (i.e., its Levi-Civita connection). This condition is equivalent to the curve being a geodesic of the surface.\n\nNow, consider a circle of latitude on this sphere, defined by the intersection of the sphere with a plane $z=c$, where $c$ is a constant such that $0 < |c| < R$. This ensures the circle is not the equator ($c=0$) or a pole ($|c|=R$).\n\nBased on geometric reasoning, and without calculating Christoffel symbols or solving the geodesic equations explicitly, determine which of the following statements provides the correct justification for why such a latitude circle is *not* an autoparallel curve.\n\nA.

That is, $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\gamma'(t) = 0$.\n\nFor a surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the acceleration vector of the curve in the ambient space, $\\gamma''(t)$, can be uniquely decomposed into a component normal to the surface and a component tangent to the surface. This is expressed by the Gauss formula:\n$$ \\gamma''(t) = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\gamma'(t) + \\mathrm{II}(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t))\\mathbf{n} $$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\gamma'(t)$ is the covariant acceleration (the tangential component), $\\mathrm{II}$ is the second fundamental form, and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nFrom this formula, a curve is autoparallel ($\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\gamma'(t) = 0$) if and only if its acceleration vector $\\gamma''(t)$ in the ambient space is entirely normal to the surface at every point on the curve. In other words, $\\gamma''(t)$ must be parallel to the surface normal $\\mathbf{n}$.\n\nLet's analyze the latitude circle. The sphere is given by $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2$. The latitude circle is in the plane $z=c$. The radius of this circle is $r = \\sqrt{R^2 - c^2}$. We can parametrize this circle, for instance by arc length $s$, as:\n$$ \\gamma(s) = (r\\cos(s/r), r\\sin(s/r), c) $$\nThe velocity vector (tangent vector) is:\n$$ \\gamma'(s) = (-\\sin(s/r), \\cos(s/r), 0) $$\nThe acceleration vector is found by differentiating the velocity vector:\n$$ \\gamma''(s) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\cos(s/r), -\\frac{1}{r}\\sin(s/r), 0\\right) $$\nThis acceleration vector points from the point $\\gamma(s)$ on the circle towards the center of the circle, which is $(0, 0, c)$ on the z-axis. Geometrically, it is a horizontal vector, lying entirely in the plane $z=c$.\n\nNow, let's consider the surface normal $\\mathbf{n}$ of the sphere at a point $\\gamma(s)$ on the latitude circle. For a sphere centered at the origin, the normal vector at a point $(x,y,z)$ on its surface is parallel to the position vector $(x,y,z)$. So, at $\\gamma(s)$, the normal vector points in the direction of:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} \\propto (r\\cos(s/r), r\\sin(s/r), c) $$\nSince we have specified that $c \\neq 0$, this normal vector always has a non-zero vertical component (a component in the z-direction).\n\nFor the latitude circle to be an autoparallel curve, its acceleration vector $\\gamma''(s)$ would have to be parallel to the surface normal $\\mathbf{n}$. However, we have found that $\\gamma''(s)$ is purely horizontal (its z-component is zero), while the normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ has a non-zero vertical component (as long as we are not on the equator, where $c=0$).\n\nTherefore, the acceleration vector of the latitude circle is not parallel to the surface normal. This means the acceleration vector has a non-zero component tangent to the sphere. This tangential component is precisely the non-vanishing geodesic acceleration $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}\\gamma'$. Thus, the latitude circle is not an autoparallel curve.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. The Gaussian curvature being constant is a property of the sphere, but it doesn't directly explain why a specific curve is or isn't a geodesic. Great circles are geodesics on this same surface.\nB. A latitude circle is a planar curve, so its torsion as a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is zero. This statement is false.\nC. The tangent vector is non-constant for any curved path, including great circles which *are* autoparallel. So this is not the distinguishing reason.\nD. This statement is the core of our reasoning. The acceleration vector points towards the center of the latitude circle, not the center of the sphere, and is therefore not aligned with the sphere's normal vector.
