The function $\\mathrm{sn}_{K}(r)$ is defined as the solution $y(r)$ to this initial value problem.\n\nWe can determine the form of $\\mathrm{sn}_{K}(r)$ by solving the ODE for three cases of $K$:\n1.

The derivative is $y'(r) = Bk \\cos(kr)$. The condition $y'(0)=1$ implies $Bk=1$, so $B = 1/k$. Thus, $\\mathrm{sn}_{K}(r) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sin(kr) = \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{K}r)}{\\sqrt{K}}$.\n2.  If $K = 0$, the equation is $y''(r) = 0$. The general solution is $y(r) = Ar+B$. The condition $y(0)=0$ implies $B=0$. The derivative is $y'(r)=A$. The condition $y'(0)=1$ implies $A=1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{sn}_{0}(r) = r$.\n3.  If $K  0$, let $K = -k^2$ for some $k>0$. The equation is $y''(r) - k^2 y(r) = 0$. The general solution is $y(r) = A \\cosh(kr) + B \\sinh(kr)$.

Its deviation from the flat Euclidean case, $g = dr^2 + r^2g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$, is governed by the Riemann curvature tensor at the center point $p$.\n\nWe use the Jacobi equation along a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(r)$ with $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = v \\in T_pM$:\n$$ J''(r) + R\\big(J(r),\\dot{\\gamma}(r)\\big)\\,\\dot{\\gamma}(r) = 0. $$\nHere, $J(r)$ is a Jacobi field representing an infinitesimal variation of geodesics. For a variation in an angular direction specified by a unit vector $w \\in T_pM$ with $\\langle w, v \\rangle = 0$, the corresponding Jacobi field has initial conditions $J(0)=0$ and $J'(0)=w$. The length of this Jacobi field, $|J(r)|$, tells us the distance at $\\gamma(r)$ between the central geodesic and the infinitesimally perturbed one. The quantity $|J(r)|^2$ is the component of the angular metric tensor $h(r,v/|v|)$ acting on the vector $w$.\n\nWe find the Taylor expansion of $J(r)$ around $r=0$:\n$ J(r) = J(0) + J'(0)r + \\frac{J''(0)}{2!}r^2 + \\frac{J'''(0)}{3!}r^3 + O(r^4). $\nUsing the initial conditions, $J(0)=0$ and $J'(0)=w$.\nFrom the Jacobi equation at $r=0$:\n$ J''(0) = -R(J(0), \\dot{\\gamma}(0))\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = -R(0,v)v = 0. $\nTo find $J'''(0)$, we differentiate the Jacobi equation. Since $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$, and using the first Bianchi identity and Leibniz rule, the covariant derivative of the equation gives:\n$ J'''(r) + R\\big(J'(r),\\dot{\\gamma}(r)\\big)\\,\\dot{\\gamma}(r) + \\dots = 0 $, where the dots contain terms with $J(r)$ which vanish at $r=0$.\nEvaluating at $r=0$:\n$ J'''(0) = -R(J'(0), \\dot{\\gamma}(0))\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = -R(w,v)v. $\nSubstituting these derivatives into the Taylor series for $J(r)$:\n$ J(r) = rw - \\frac{r^3}{6}R(w,v)v + O(r^4). $\nThe squared norm of this vector is:\n$$ |J(r)|^2 = \\langle J(r), J(r) \\rangle = \\left\\langle rw - \\frac{r^3}{6}R(w,v)v + O(r^4), rw - \\frac{r^3}{6}R(w,v)v + O(r^4) \\right\\rangle. $$\nExpanding this inner product and using the facts that $|w|=1$, $|v|=1$, and $\\langle w,v \\rangle=0$:\n$$ |J(r)|^2 = r^2\\langle w,w \\rangle - 2 \\frac{r^4}{6} \\langle w, R(w,v)v \\rangle + O(r^5) = r^2 - \\frac{r^4}{3} \\langle w, R(w,v)v \\rangle + O(r^5). $$\nThe term $\\langle w, R(w,v)v \\rangle$ is, by definition, the sectional curvature $K_p(v,w)$ of the $2$-plane spanned by the orthonormal vectors $v$ and $w$ at the point $p$. Thus, we have the expansion:\n$$ |J(r)|^2 = r^2 - \\frac{K_p(v,w)}{3}r^4 + O(r^5). $$\nThis demonstrates how the leading-order correction to the angular part of the metric is governed by the Riemann curvature tensor.

For a space form, $K_p(v,w)$ is a constant $K$ for all points $p$ and all $2$-planes, recovering our first result.\nThus, the geometry of small geodesic spheres is directly controlled by the sectional curvatures at the center point.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{K}{3}}\n$$", "id": "3069996"}]}
