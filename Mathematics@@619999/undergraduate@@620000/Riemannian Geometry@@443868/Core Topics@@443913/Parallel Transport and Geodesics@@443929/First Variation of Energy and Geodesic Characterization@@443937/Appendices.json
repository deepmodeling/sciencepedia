The conditions for a curve to be a critical point are given by the Euler-Lagrange equations. For our system with coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$, there are two such equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta'}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varphi'}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varphi} = 0\n$$\n\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives of the Lagrangian $L$:\nFor the $\\theta$ coordinate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta'} = \\theta'\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} (\\sin^2\\theta) (\\varphi')^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta) (\\varphi')^2 = \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta (\\varphi')^2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the first Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta') - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta (\\varphi')^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\theta'' - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta (\\varphi')^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is the first geodesic equation.\n\nFor the $\\varphi$ coordinate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varphi'} = \\sin^2\\theta \\, \\varphi'\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varphi} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these into the second Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin^2\\theta \\, \\varphi') - 0 = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the quantity $\\sin^2\\theta \\, \\varphi'$ is a constant of motion along any geodesic.

We have found a specific variation for which the first variation is $4\\pi \\sin(2\\theta_0)$.\nFor the latitude circle $\\gamma_0$ to be a geodesic, this first variation must be zero:\n$$\n4\\pi \\sin(2\\theta_0) = 0\n$$\nThis implies $\\sin(2\\theta_0) = 0$. Since $\\theta_0 \\in (0, \\pi)$, we have $2\\theta_0 \\in (0, 2\\pi)$. The only value in this interval for which $\\sin(2\\theta_0)=0$ is $2\\theta_0 = \\pi$, which means $\\theta_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThis corresponds to the equator, which is a great circle and is indeed a geodesic.\nFor any latitude circle where $\\theta_0 \\neq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $\\sin(2\\theta_0) \\neq 0$.

Identification of conserved quantities.\nThe metric $g = dr^{2} + \\phi(r)^{2} d\\Omega^{2}$ has a symmetry corresponding to the isometries of the sphere $(S^{n-1}, d\\Omega^{2})$. The standard round metric $d\\Omega^{2}$ is invariant under the action of the rotation group $SO(n)$.\nAccording to Noether's theorem, every continuous symmetry of the Lagrangian gives rise to a conserved quantity along the paths of motion (geodesics).\nLet $K$ be a Killing vector field on $(S^{n-1}, d\\Omega^{2})$. Any such $K$ generates a one-parameter group of isometries. We can lift $K$ to a vector field on the product manifold, which we also denote $K$, that has no component in the $\\partial_r$ direction. The Lagrangian $L$ is invariant under the flow generated by $K$.\nThe conserved quantity associated with this symmetry is given by the inner product of the canonical momentum and the symmetry vector field. A more direct statement from Riemannian geometry is that $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, K)$ is constant along any geodesic $\\gamma$.\n$$g(\\dot{\\gamma}, K) = g(\\dot{r}\\partial_{r} + \\dot{\\Omega}, K) = g(\\dot{\\Omega}, K) = \\phi(r)^{2} g_{S^{n-1}}(\\dot{\\Omega}, K)$$\nHere $\\dot{\\Omega} = \\dot{\\theta}^{i}\\partial_{\\theta^{i}}$. In local coordinates, if $K = K^{i}(\\theta)\\partial_{\\theta^{i}}$, the conserved quantity is $\\phi(r)^{2}h_{ij}\\dot{\\theta}^{i}K^{j}$.\nThe canonical momentum conjugate to the coordinate $\\theta^{k}$ is $p_{k} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}^{k}} = \\phi(r)^{2}h_{kj}\\dot{\\theta}^{j}$.\nSo, the conserved quantity can be expressed in terms of the canonical momenta as:\n$$Q_{K} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_{k} K^{k}(\\theta)$$\nThis means that for every Killing field on the sphere (i.e., for every infinitesimal rotation), there is a corresponding conserved component of angular momentum, where the angular momentum itself is defined as the scaled momentum $p_{\\Omega}$.\n\n3. Clairaut's relation for $n=2$.\nFor $n=2$, the manifold is $(a,b)\\times S^{1}$, which is a surface of revolution. The metric is $g = dr^{2} + \\phi(r)^{2} d\\theta^{2}$. The Lagrangian is:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{r}^{2} + \\phi(r)^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2})$$\nThe coordinate $\\theta$ is a cyclic coordinate, meaning the Lagrangian does not depend on $\\theta$ explicitly ($\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$). From the Euler–Lagrange equation for $\\theta$, we immediately have a conserved quantity:\n$$p_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\phi(r)^{2}\\dot{\\theta} = \\text{constant}$$\nThe problem states that $\\gamma(t)$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which means $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 1$.\n$$\\dot{r}^{2} + \\phi(r)^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2} = 1$$\nThe angle $\\alpha(t)$ is defined as the angle between the tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\dot{r}\\partial_{r} + \\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta}$ and the meridian vector $\\partial_{r}$. The angle between two vectors $u, v$ is given by $\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{g(u,v)}{|u|_g|v|_g}$.\nThe basis vectors $\\partial_r$ and $\\partial_\\theta$ are orthogonal since $g_{r\\theta}=0$. The length of $\\partial_r$ is $|\\partial_r|_g = \\sqrt{g_{rr}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. By definition, $|\\dot{\\gamma}|_g=1$.\n$$ \\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{g(\\dot{r}\\partial_{r} + \\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{r})}{|\\dot{\\gamma}|_g |\\partial_{r}|_g} = \\frac{\\dot{r} g_{rr} + \\dot{\\theta} g_{\\theta r}}{1 \\cdot 1} = \\dot{r} $$\nSubstituting $\\dot{r} = \\cos(\\alpha)$ into the unit-speed condition:\n$$\\cos^{2}(\\alpha) + \\phi(r)^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2} = 1$$\n$$\\phi(r)^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2} = 1 - \\cos^{2}(\\alpha) = \\sin^{2}(\\alpha)$$\nTaking the positive square root (the sign choice for $\\alpha$ and $\\dot{\\theta}$ can be synchronized), we have:\n$$\\phi(r)\\dot{\\theta} = \\sin(\\alpha)$$\nThe conserved quantity is the momentum $p_\\theta$. Let's call the Clairaut constant $C$, as per the problem's notation. The conserved quantity from the $\\theta$-symmetry is precisely this constant.\n$$C = p_{\\theta} = \\phi(r)^{2}\\dot{\\theta} = \\phi(r) \\left( \\phi(r)\\dot{\\theta} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\phi(r)\\dot{\\theta}$:\n$$C = \\phi(r)\\sin(\\alpha)$$\nThis equation, stating that the quantity $\\phi(r)\\sin(\\alpha)$ is conserved along a geodesic, is the classical Clairaut's relation.\nSince $C$ is a constant along the entire geodesic, its value can be determined from the initial conditions at $t=0$, which are $r(0) = r_{0}$ and $\\alpha(0) = \\alpha_{0}$.\n$$C = \\phi(r(0))\\sin(\\alpha(0)) = \\phi(r_{0})\\sin(\\alpha_{0})$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the conserved Clairaut constant $C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\phi(r_{0})\\sin(\\alpha_{0})}$$", "id": "3046476"}]}
