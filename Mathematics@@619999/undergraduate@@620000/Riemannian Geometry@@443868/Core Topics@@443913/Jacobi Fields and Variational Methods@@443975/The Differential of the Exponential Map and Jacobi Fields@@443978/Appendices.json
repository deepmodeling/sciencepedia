It asks for standard derivations concerning the exponential map in the simplest setting, Euclidean space, using fundamental definitions.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the explicit formula for $\\exp_{p}(v)$**\n\nThe exponential map $\\exp_{p}(v)$ is defined via geodesics. A geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a curve that parallel transports its own tangent vector, satisfying the geodesic equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. Let us work in the standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ for $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In these coordinates, the geodesic equation for a curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma^1(t), \\dots, \\gamma^n(t))$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\gamma^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\Gamma_{ij}^k(\\gamma(t)) \\frac{d\\gamma^i}{dt} \\frac{d\\gamma^j}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1, \\dots, n $$\nwhere $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection. The Christoffel symbols are defined by the metric $g$ as:\n$$ \\Gamma_{ij}^k = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{l=1}^{n} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right) $$\nIn Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ with the standard metric, the metric tensor components are constant, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ (the Kronecker delta). Consequently, all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} = 0$ for all $i, j, l$. This implies that all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$ for all $i, j, k$.\n\nThe geodesic equation thus simplifies significantly to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\gamma^k}{dt^2} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1, \\dots, n $$\nThis is a system of second-order ordinary differential equations. Integrating once with respect to $t$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d\\gamma^k}{dt} = c_1^k $$\nwhere $c_1^k$ are constants of integration. Integrating a second time yields:\n$$ \\gamma^k(t) = c_1^k t + c_2^k $$\nwhere $c_2^k$ are also constants. In vector notation, the solution is $\\gamma(t) = At + B$, where $A, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are constant vectors.\n\nWe use the initial conditions for the specific geodesic $\\gamma_v(t)$ to determine $A$ and $B$. The conditions are $\\gamma_v(0) = p$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_v(0) = v$.\nApplying the first condition:\n$$ \\gamma_v(0) = A(0) + B = p \\implies B = p $$\nApplying the second condition, after finding the velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_v(t) = A$:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_v(0) = A = v $$\nTherefore, the unique geodesic $\\gamma_v(t)$ starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v$ is given by the straight line:\n$$ \\gamma_v(t) = p + tv $$\nBy definition, the Riemannian exponential map is $\\exp_{p}(v) = \\gamma_v(1)$. Substituting $t=1$ into the expression for the geodesic, we obtain:\n$$ \\exp_{p}(v) = p + v $$\nThis is the explicit formula for the exponential map in Euclidean space. We are using the canonical identification of the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\mathbb{R}^n$ itself, so $p$ and $v$ are both treated as vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n**2. Computation of the differential $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}$**\n\nThe differential $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}$ is a linear map from $T_v(T_p\\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $T_{\\exp_p(v)}\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector space, its tangent space at any point $v$ can be canonically identified with $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ itself. So, $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}: T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\to T_{p+v}\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nTo compute this differential using Jacobi fields, we consider a smooth curve of tangent vectors $v(s)$ in $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $v(0) = v$ and the initial tangent to this curve is $w \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e., $v'(0) = w$. A simple choice for such a curve is $v(s) = v + sw$.\n\nWe then construct a two-parameter variation through geodesics $f(t,s) = \\exp_p(t \\cdot v(s))$. For a fixed $s$, the curve $t \\mapsto f(t,s)$ is the geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v(s)$. The Jacobi field $J(t)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma_v(t) = f(t,0)$ is the variational vector field:\n$$ J(t) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s}(t,0) $$\nThe differential of the exponential map is related to this Jacobi field by the formula:\n$$ d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}(w) = J(1) $$\nThe Jacobi field $J(t)$ must satisfy the Jacobi equation along $\\gamma_v(t)$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_v}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_v} J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}_v(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_v(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. For Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$, the Christoffel symbols are all zero. The components of the Riemann curvature tensor are given by:\n$$ R^l_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{kj}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} + \\sum_{m} (\\Gamma^m_{kj}\\Gamma^l_{im} - \\Gamma^m_{ij}\\Gamma^l_{km}) $$\nSince all $\\Gamma_{ij}^k=0$, it is immediate that all components $R^l_{ijk}$ are zero. Thus, the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero, $R=0$. The Jacobi equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_v}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_v} J(t) = 0 $$\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the covariant derivative along a curve is simply the ordinary time derivative. Thus, we have the vector-valued ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $J(t) = At + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. To find $A$ and $B$, we use the initial conditions for the Jacobi field $J(t)$:\nFirst, $J(0) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s}(0,0)$. Since $f(0,s) = \\exp_p(0) = p$ for all $s$, we have:\n$$ J(0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}\\big|_{s=0} p = 0 $$\nSecond, the initial covariant derivative of $J(t)$ is given by the connecting vector of the variation, which is $w$. In Cartesian coordinates, this condition is $J'(0) = w$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_v}J(0) = \\frac{D J}{dt}(0) = J'(0) = w $$\nThis is derived from commuting partial derivatives: $\\nabla_s \\dot{\\gamma}_v(0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}|_{s=0} (v(s)) = v'(0) = w$.\n\nApplying these initial conditions to the general solution $J(t) = At+B$:\n- From $J(0) = 0$, we have $A(0) + B = 0$, which gives $B = 0$.\n- The derivative is $J'(t) = A$. From $J'(0) = w$, we have $A=w$.\nThe specific Jacobi field for this variation is therefore:\n$$ J(t) = wt $$\nFinally, we evaluate $J(t)$ at $t=1$ to find the action of the differential:\n$$ d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}(w) = J(1) = w \\cdot 1 = w $$\n\n**3. Conclusion on the nature of $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}$**\n\nThe calculation in part 2 shows that for any tangent vector $w \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$, the linear map $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}$ maps $w$ to itself, i.e., $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}(w) = w$. Under the canonical identification of all tangent spaces of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\mathbb{R}^n$ itself, this map is the identity transformation. This result holds for any $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nTherefore, $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}$ is the identity map Id: $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\to T_{p+v}\\mathbb{R}^n$, where Id$(w)=w$. If we choose the standard basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ for both the domain $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$ and the codomain $T_{p+v}\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$, the action of the map on the basis vectors is $d(\\exp_p)|_v(e_i) = e_i$. The matrix representation of this linear map is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, which we denote as $I_n$.\n$$ [d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}]_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} $$\n\nThe final answer consists of the expression for $\\exp_{p}(v)$ and the matrix representation of $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}$.\n- Expression for $\\exp_{p}(v)$: $p+v$.\n- Matrix for $d(\\exp_{p})|_{v}$: $I_n$, the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} p+v & I_n \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3069374"}, {"introduction": "Having established the trivial behavior in flat space, we now investigate how the differential of the exponential map is altered by constant sectional curvature $K$.

The differential $d\\exp_p\\big|_{v}$ maps a vector $w \\in T_p M$ (identified with $T_v(T_p M)$) to the vector $J_w(1) \\in T_{\\exp_p(v)}M$, where $J_w(t)$ is the Jacobi field along the geodesic $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(tv)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ satisfying the initial conditions $J_w(0) = 0$ and $J'_w(0) = w$. Here, $J'_w(0)$ denotes the covariant derivative $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(0)} J_w$ at $t=0$.

Thus, the equation becomes\n$$J'' + K(r^2 J - g(J,\\gamma')\\gamma') = 0$$\nTo find the singular values of the linear map $A = d\\exp_{p}\\big|_{v}$, we analyze its action on an orthonormal basis of $T_p M$. The structure of the Jacobi equation suggests a natural decomposition of $T_p M$ into the subspace parallel to $v$ and the subspace orthogonal to $v$. The operator $A^*A$ is diagonal in a basis adapted to this decomposition, and its eigenvalues are the squares of the singular values of $A$.\n\nCase 1: Vector parallel to $v$.\nLet $w$ be a vector in $T_p M$ parallel to $v$. We can write $w = c v$ for some scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\gamma'(0)=v$, we have $w = c \\gamma'(0)$. Consider the vector field $J(t) = ct\\gamma'(t)$ along $\\gamma$. We verify that this is the required Jacobi field.\nThe initial condition $J(0) = c \\cdot 0 \\cdot \\gamma'(0) = 0$ is satisfied.\nThe covariant derivative is $J'(t) = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}(ct\\gamma'(t)) = c\\gamma'(t) + ct\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\gamma'(t)$. Since $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\gamma'(t) = 0$. Thus, $J'(t) = c\\gamma'(t)$.\nThe second initial condition $J'(0) = c\\gamma'(0) = cv = w$ is also satisfied.\nThe vector field $J(t) = ct\\gamma'(t)$ is indeed the correct Jacobi field. Its value at $t=1$ is $J(1) = c\\gamma'(1)$.\nThe map $d\\exp_p\\big|_{v}$ sends the input vector $w = cv$ to the output vector $c\\gamma'(1)$.\nThe norm of the input vector is $\\|w\\| = \\|cv\\| = |c|\\|v\\| = |c|r$.\nThe norm of the output vector is $\\|c\\gamma'(1)\\| = |c|\\|\\gamma'(1)\\| = |c|r$, since the speed of the geodesic is constant.\nThe scaling factor, which is the singular value corresponding to this direction, is the ratio of the norms:\n$$s_{\\parallel} = \\frac{\\|c\\gamma'(1)\\|}{\\|cv\\|} = \\frac{|c|r}{|c|r} = 1$$\nThis singular value is $1$ for all three space forms, regardless of the value of $K$.\n\nCase 2: Vector orthogonal to $v$.\nLet $w$ be a vector in $T_p M$ such that $g(w,v)=0$. Let $J(t)$ be the Jacobi field along $\\gamma(t)$ with $J(0)=0$ and $J'(0)=w$. We examine the quantity $g(J(t), \\gamma'(t))$.\n$\\frac{d}{dt}g(J, \\gamma') = g(J', \\gamma') + g(J, \\nabla_{\\gamma'}\\gamma') = g(J', \\gamma')$.\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}g(J, \\gamma') = g(J'', \\gamma')$.\nUsing the Jacobi equation, $g(J'', \\gamma') = -K(r^2 g(J, \\gamma') - g(J,\\gamma')g(\\gamma',\\gamma')) = 0$.\nSo $g(J, \\gamma')$ is a linear function of $t$. Since $g(J(0), \\gamma'(0))=g(0,v)=0$ and $\\frac{d}{dt}g(J, \\gamma')|_{t=0} = g(J'(0), \\gamma'(0)) = g(w,v)=0$, the function must be identically zero. Therefore, $J(t)$ remains orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$ for all $t$.\nThis simplifies the Jacobi equation for this case to $J'' + Kr^2 J = 0$.\nLet $E(t)$ be the parallel transport of the initial vector $w$ along $\\gamma(t)$. Then $J(t)$ can be written as $J(t) = f(t)E(t)$ for some scalar function $f(t)$. Since $E(t)$ is parallel, its covariant derivatives along $\\gamma$ are zero. Substituting into the Jacobi equation yields a scalar ordinary differential equation for $f(t)$:\n$$f''(t) + Kr^2 f(t) = 0$$\nThe initial conditions for $J(t)$ translate to initial conditions for $f(t)$:\n$J(0) = f(0)E(0) = 0 \\implies f(0)=0$.\n$J'(0) = f'(0)E(0) = w \\implies f'(0)=1$.\nThe scaling factor for orthogonal vectors is $|f(1)|$.

That is, $\\mathrm{d}\\exp_p|_v(w) = J(1)$.\n\nThe Jacobi field equation along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is\n$$\n\\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{D}{dt}$ denotes the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. For a space form of constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor is given by\n$$\nR(X, Y)Z = K(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Jacobi equation, we get\n$$\n\\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + K(\\langle \\gamma', J \\rangle \\gamma' - \\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle J) = 0\n$$\nAs $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = r$, we have $\\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle = r^2$. The equation becomes\n$$\n\\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + K(r^2 J - \\langle \\gamma', J \\rangle \\gamma') = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $w$ is orthogonal to $v$, so $\\langle w, v \\rangle = 0$. Since $v = \\gamma'(0)$, the initial derivative of the Jacobi field, $J'(0)=w$, is orthogonal to the initial velocity of the geodesic, $\\gamma'(0)$. For a Jacobi field with $J(0)=0$, this orthogonality is preserved along the geodesic. Hence, $\\langle J(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$. Such a field is called a normal Jacobi field.\n\nFor a normal Jacobi field, the term $\\langle \\gamma', J \\rangle \\gamma'$ vanishes, and the equation simplifies to\n$$\n\\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + Kr^2 J = 0\n$$\nThis is a linear second-order ordinary differential equation for the vector field $J(t)$. Let $W(t)$ be the vector field obtained by parallel transporting the initial vector $w$ along $\\gamma(t)$. The solution to the Jacobi equation with initial conditions $J(0)=0$ and $J'(0)=w$ can be written as $J(t) = g(t)W(t)$, where $g(t)$ is a scalar function satisfying the ordinary differential equation\n$$\ng''(t) + Kr^2 g(t) = 0\n$$\nwith initial conditions $g(0)=0$ and $g'(0)=1$. The condition $g'(0)=1$ ensures that $J'(0) = g'(0)W(0) + g(0)\\frac{DW}{dt}|_{t=0} = 1 \\cdot w + 0 = w$.\n\nWe now solve for $g(t)$ for the three cases of $K$.\nCase 1: $M = \\mathbb{R}^n$, $K=0$.\nThe equation becomes $g''(t) = 0$. The general solution is $g(t) = c_1 t + c_2$.\nFrom $g(0)=0$, we get $c_2=0$. From $g'(0)=1$, we get $c_1=1$.\nThus, $g(t) = t$.\n\nCase 2: $M = S^n$, $K=+1$.\nThe equation is $g''(t) + r^2 g(t) = 0$. The general solution is $g(t) = c_1 \\cos(rt) + c_2 \\sin(rt)$.\nFrom $g(0)=0$, we get $c_1=0$.\nThe derivative is $g'(t) = c_2 r \\cos(rt)$. From $g'(0)=1$, we get $c_2 r = 1$, so $c_2 = 1/r$.\nThus, $g(t) = \\frac{\\sin(rt)}{r}$.\n\nCase 3: $M = \\mathbb{H}^n$, $K=-1$.\nThe equation is $g''(t) - r^2 g(t) = 0$. The general solution is $g(t) = c_1 \\cosh(rt) + c_2 \\sinh(rt)$.\nFrom $g(0)=0$, we get $c_1=0$.\nThe derivative is $g'(t) = c_2 r \\cosh(rt)$. From $g'(0)=1$, we get $c_2 r = 1$, so $c_2 = 1/r$.\nThus, $g(t) = \\frac{\\sinh(rt)}{r}$.\n\nThe differential $\\mathrm{d}\\exp_p|_v(w)$ is $J(1) = g(1)W(1)$. Since parallel transport is an isometry, $\\|W(1)\\| = \\|w\\|$. The norm is\n$$\n\\|\\mathrm{d}\\exp_p|_v(w)\\| = \\|g(1)W(1)\\| = |g(1)| \\|W(1)\\| = |g(1)| \\|w\\|\n$$\nFor small $r > 0$, the function $g(1)$ is positive in all three cases. The scaling factor is therefore\n$$\n\\sigma_M(r) = g(1)\n$$\nLet's evaluate $g(1)$ for each case:\nFor $M=\\mathbb{R}^n$ ($K=0$): $\\sigma_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(r) = g(1) = 1$.\nFor $M=S^n$ ($K=+1$): $\\sigma_{S^n}(r) = g(1) = \\frac{\\sin(r)}{r}$.\nFor $M=\\mathbb{H}^n$ ($K=-1$): $\\sigma_{\\mathbb{H}^n}(r) = g(1) = \\frac{\\sinh(r)}{r}$.\n\nFinally, we find the degree-$3$ Taylor polynomial of each function around $r=0$.\n1.  For $M=\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n    $\\sigma_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(r) = 1$. The Taylor polynomial of any degree is simply $1$.\n\n2.  For $M=S^n$:\n    $\\sigma_{S^n}(r) = \\frac{\\sin(r)}{r}$. We use the Taylor series for $\\sin(r)$:\n    $$\n    \\sin(r) = r - \\frac{r^3}{3!} + \\frac{r^5}{5!} - \\dots = r - \\frac{r^3}{6} + O(r^5)\n    $$\n    Dividing by $r$, we get\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\sin(r)}{r} = 1 - \\frac{r^2}{6} + \\frac{r^4}{120} - \\dots = 1 - \\frac{r^2}{6} + O(r^4)\n    $$\n    The degree-$3$ Taylor polynomial is obtained by truncating the series, keeping terms up to degree $3$. Thus, the polynomial is $1 - \\frac{r^2}{6}$.\n\n3.  For $M=\\mathbb{H}^n$:\n    $\\sigma_{\\mathbb{H}^n}(r) = \\frac{\\sinh(r)}{r}$. We use the Taylor series for $\\sinh(r)$:\n    $$\n    \\sinh(r) = r + \\frac{r^3}{3!} + \\frac{r^5}{5!} + \\dots = r + \\frac{r^3}{6} + O(r^5)\n    $$\n    Dividing by $r$, we get\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\sinh(r)}{r} = 1 + \\frac{r^2}{6} + \\frac{r^4}{120} + \\dots = 1 + \\frac{r^2}{6} + O(r^4)\n    $$\n    The degree-$3$ Taylor polynomial is $1 + \\frac{r^2}{6}$.\n\nIn summary, the degree-$3$ Taylor polynomials at $r=0$ are:\n- For $M=\\mathbb{R}^n$: $1$\n- For $M=S^n$: $1 - \\frac{r^2}{6}$\n- For $M=\\mathbb{H}^n$: $1 + \\frac{r^2}{6}$\nThese can be written compactly as $1 - \\frac{K}{6}r^2$ for $K \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the result as a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 - \\frac{r^2}{6} & 1 + \\frac{r^2}{6}\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3069404"}]}
