For such a manifold, the curvature operator has a simplified form:\n$$ R(X, Y)Z = K(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y) $$\nIn our case, $K=1$, $X=J(t)$, $Y=Z=\\gamma'(t)$. Since $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, $\\langle \\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = \\|v\\|^2 = 1$. The Jacobi equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{D}^2}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}J(t) + \\left( \\langle \\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle J(t) - \\langle J(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle \\gamma'(t) \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{D}^2}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}J(t) + J(t) - \\langle J(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle \\gamma'(t) = 0 $$\nLet us decompose the Jacobi field $J(t)$ into components parallel and orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$.

Its second covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 a}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\mathrm{D}^2 J}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}, \\gamma' \\right\\rangle + 2\\left\\langle \\frac{\\mathrm{D} J}{\\mathrm{d}t}, \\frac{\\mathrm{D}\\gamma'}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle J, \\frac{\\mathrm{D}^2\\gamma'}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\right\\rangle $$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, $\\frac{\\mathrm{D}\\gamma'}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$, so the second and third terms vanish.

An arbitrary orthogonal Jacobi field can be written as $J^{\\perp}(t) = j_2(t)e_2(t) + j_3(t)e_3(t)$.

This implies $j_i(0)=0$, which gives $A_i=0$.\nSo, $j_i(t) = B_i \\sin(t)$.\nThe initial derivative is $J_w'(0) = w$. Let $w_{\\perp} = w - \\langle w, v \\rangle v$ be the component of $w$ orthogonal to $v$.\nThen $(J^{\\perp})'(0) = J_w'(0) - (\\langle w, v \\rangle \\gamma'(t))'|_{t=0} = w - \\langle w,v \\rangle v = w_{\\perp}$.\nAlso, $(J^{\\perp})'(0) = j_2'(0)e_2(0) + j_3'(0)e_3(0)$. Since $j_i'(t) = B_i \\cos(t)$, we have $j_i'(0) = B_i$.\nComparing with the components of $w_{\\perp}$ in the basis $\\{e_2(0), e_3(0)\\}$, we find that the vector of coefficients $(B_2, B_3)$ corresponds to the components of $w_{\\perp}$. So, $J^{\\perp}(t) = \\sin(t) P_t(w_{\\perp})$, where $P_t(w_{\\perp})$ is the parallel transport of $w_{\\perp}$ along $\\gamma$ from $t=0$ to $t$.\n\nCombining the parallel and perpendicular components, the complete Jacobi field $J_w(t)$ is:\n$$ J_w(t) = (\\langle w, v \\rangle t) \\gamma'(t) + \\sin(t) P_t(w_{\\perp}) $$\nWe want to find the space of vectors $w$ such that $J_w(\\pi) = 0$. Let's evaluate at $t=\\pi$:\n$$ J_w(\\pi) = (\\langle w, v \\rangle \\pi) \\gamma'(\\pi) + \\sin(\\pi) P_\\pi(w_{\\perp}) $$\nSince $\\sin(\\pi)=0$, the second term vanishes.\n$$ J_w(\\pi) = (\\langle w, v \\rangle \\pi) \\gamma'(\\pi) $$\nFor this vector to be the zero vector, since $\\pi \\neq 0$ and $\\gamma'(\\pi)$ is a non-zero tangent vector, we must have:\n$$ \\langle w, v \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis is the condition that $w$ must satisfy for $J_w(\\pi)$ to be zero. The set of all such $w$ is the kernel of $\\mathrm{d}\\exp_p|_{\\pi v}$. This is precisely the set of vectors in $T_p M$ that are orthogonal to the vector $v$.\nThis set forms a vector subspace of $T_p M$, denoted as $v^{\\perp}$. The dimension of the manifold is given as $n=3$. The dimension of the total tangent space $T_p M$ is $3$. The vector $v$ spans a $1$-dimensional subspace.
