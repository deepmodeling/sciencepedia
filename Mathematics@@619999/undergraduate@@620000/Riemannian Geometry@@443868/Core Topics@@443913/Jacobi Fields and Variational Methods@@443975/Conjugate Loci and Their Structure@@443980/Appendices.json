I will address each part in sequence, building upon the results from the previous parts.\n\nFirst, to address part (a), we derive the Gaussian curvature $K(r)$. The metric of the surface of revolution is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ as $ds^2 = dr^2 + f(r)^2 d\\theta^2$. The metric tensor components are $g_{rr} = 1$, $g_{\\theta\\theta} = f(r)^2$, and $g_{r\\theta}=0$. We use the method of moving frames.

The corresponding dual coframe of $1$-forms is $\\{\\theta^1, \\theta^2\\}$ where $\\theta^1 = dr$ and $\\theta^2 = f(r)d\\theta$.\n\nWe calculate the exterior derivatives of the coframe forms:\n$d\\theta^1 = d(dr) = 0$.\n$d\\theta^2 = d(f(r)d\\theta) = f'(r)dr \\wedge d\\theta$.\nTo express $d\\theta^2$ in terms of the coframe basis, we substitute $d\\theta = \\frac{1}{f(r)}\\theta^2$ and $dr = \\theta^1$:\n$d\\theta^2 = f'(r)\\theta^1 \\wedge \\frac{1}{f(r)}\\theta^2 = \\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\theta^1 \\wedge \\theta^2$.\n\nAccording to Cartan's first structural equation, $d\\theta^i = -\\omega^i_j \\wedge \\theta^j$, where $\\omega^i_j$ are the connection $1$-forms. For a $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the connection forms satisfy $\\omega^1_1 = \\omega^2_2 = 0$ and $\\omega^1_2 = -\\omega^2_1$.

Since $ds^2 = dr^2$ for $\\theta = \\text{const}$, the radial coordinate $r$ is the arc-length parameter. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(r) = \\partial_r = e_1$. A Jacobi field $J(r)$ along $\\gamma$ satisfies the equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. We are interested in a transverse Jacobi field, which can be written as $J(r) = j(r)e_2(r)$ for some scalar function $j(r)$.\n\nWe compute the covariant derivative terms:\n$\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = \\nabla_{e_1}(j(r)e_2(r)) = (e_1 j)e_2 + j\\nabla_{e_1}e_2 = j'(r)e_2 + j(r)\\nabla_{e_1}e_2$.\nThe term $\\nabla_{e_1}e_2$ is determined by the connection forms: $\\nabla_{e_1}e_2 = \\omega^1_2(e_1)e_1 + \\omega^2_2(e_1)e_2$.\nFrom part (a), $\\omega^1_2 = -f'(r)d\\theta$. Thus, $\\omega^1_2(e_1) = \\omega^1_2(\\partial_r) = -f'(r)d\\theta(\\partial_r) = 0$. As $\\omega^2_2=0$, we have $\\nabla_{e_1}e_2=0$.

In $2$ dimensions, for an orthonormal frame, $R(e_2, e_1)e_1 = K e_2$. Thus, $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = j(r)K(r)e_2$.\nSubstituting into the Jacobi equation yields: $j''(r)e_2 + j(r)K(r)e_2 = 0$. This gives the scalar Jacobi equation for the amplitude $j(r)$:\n$$j''(r) + K(r)j(r) = 0$$\nA point $\\gamma(r_1)$ is conjugate to the origin $\\gamma(0)$ if there's a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(r)$ with $J(0)=0$ and $J(r_1)=0$. This corresponds to a non-trivial solution $j(r)$ with $j(0)=0$ and $j(r_1)=0$.\n\nThe rotational symmetry of the surface corresponds to the Killing vector field $X = \\partial_\\theta$. Considering the variation of geodesics generated by the flow of this isometry, $\\gamma_\\epsilon(r) = (r, \\theta_0+\\epsilon)$, we obtain a Jacobi field $J(r) = \\frac{d\\gamma_\\epsilon}{d\\epsilon}|_{\\epsilon=0} = \\partial_\\theta$. In the orthonormal frame, this is $J(r) = f(r)e_2(r)$. This implies that the function $j(r) = f(r)$ is a solution to the scalar Jacobi equation. We can verify this: $f''(r) + K(r)f(r) = f''(r) + (-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)})f(r) = 0$.\nWe examine this specific Jacobi field. At $r=0$, $J(0) = f(0)e_2(0)$. The given condition $f(0)=0$ implies $J(0)=0$.\nThe initial velocity of this field is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(0) = j'(0)e_2(0) = f'(0)e_2(0)$. The condition $f'(0)=1$ means $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(0) = e_2(0)$, which is non-zero. Hence, $J(r) = f(r)e_2(r)$ is a non-trivial Jacobi field vanishing at $r=0$.\nThe conjugate points to $r=0$ are the other values of $r>0$ for which this field vanishes. This occurs when $j(r) = f(r) = 0$. The distance to the first conjugate point is thus the smallest positive value of $r$ for which $f(r)=0$.\n\nFor part (c), we are given the specific profile function $f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha r)$ with $\\alpha > 0$. We must find the distance to the first conjugate point from $r=0$. According to the result from part (b), this distance is the smallest positive value of $r$ that is a zero of the function $f(r)$.\nWe set $f(r)=0$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha r) = 0$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$, this is equivalent to $\\sin(\\alpha r) = 0$.\nThe general solution for $\\alpha r$ is $\\alpha r = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. Since we seek the smallest positive distance $r > 0$, we require $n$ to be the smallest positive integer, which is $n=1$.\nThis gives $\\alpha r = \\pi$.\nSolving for the distance $r$, we find:\n$$r = \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}$$\nThis is the distance from the pole at $r=0$ to the first conjugate point along any meridian.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}}$$", "id": "3041701"}, {"introduction": "This final practice explores the deeper significance of conjugate points through the lens of the calculus of variations.

In Morse theory on a Riemannian manifold, the index form plays a crucial role.

This is precisely the definition of $\\gamma(\\pi)$ being a conjugate point to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$.\n\nThe connection to the index form is as follows: The null space of the index form $I$ on the space of vector fields vanishing at the endpoints is precisely the space of Jacobi fields that vanish at those same endpoints. Our calculation showed that for any such Jacobi field $J$, $I(J,J)=0$. This means that $J$ is an element of the null space of $I$. Since $J$ is non-trivial, the null space is non-trivial, and the index form is degenerate.\n\nTherefore, the occurrence of a conjugate point at $t=\\pi$ is equivalent to the index form $I(V,V)$ being degenerate, which means its nullity is greater than zero. The \"sign\" of $I(J,J)$ for a non-trivial Jacobi field $J$ vanishing at the endpoints is not positive or negative, but exactly zero. The vanishing of $I(V,V)$ for a non-zero vector field $V$ is the signature of a conjugate point at the endpoint of the geodesic segment. The fact that $S^n$ has constant curvature $1$ guarantees that the first conjugate point to $\\gamma(0)$ along a unit-speed geodesic occurs at $t=\\pi$ (the antipodal point), ensuring that the premises of the problem are sound.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3041691"}]}
