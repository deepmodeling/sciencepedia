The flat $n$-torus $T^n$ is the quotient of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by a full-rank lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. The Riemannian metric on $T^n$ is induced by the standard Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The projection map is $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T^n$. This setup means $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the universal Riemannian cover of $T^n$.\n\nThe geodesics on $T^n$ are the projections of straight lines in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The exponential map at a point $p \\in T^n$, denoted $\\exp_p: T_pT^n \\to T^n$, is related to the exponential map on the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $\\tilde{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a lift of $p$, i.e., $\\pi(\\tilde{p}) = p$. The tangent space $T_pT^n$ can be canonically identified with $T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is itself identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The exponential map on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is simply vector addition: $\\exp^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_{\\tilde{p}}(w) = \\tilde{p} + w$ for $w \\in T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$. As stated in the problem, the exponential map on the torus descends from this map. For a tangent vector $w \\in T_pT^n$, $\\exp_p(w)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\exp_p(w) = \\pi(\\exp^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_{\\tilde{p}}(w)) = \\pi(\\tilde{p} + w)\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the injectivity radius, $\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^n)$.\nBy definition, $\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^n)$ is the supremum of radii $r > 0$ such that $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism from the open ball $B_r(0) \\subset T_pT^n$ to its image. The map $\\exp_p$ fails to be injective on $B_r(0)$ if there exist two distinct vectors $w_1, w_2 \\in B_r(0)$ such that $\\exp_p(w_1) = \\exp_p(w_2)$.\nUsing the formula for the exponential map:\n$$\n\\pi(\\tilde{p} + w_1) = \\pi(\\tilde{p} + w_2)\n$$\nTwo points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ project to the same point in $T^n$ if and only if their difference is a non-zero lattice vector. Thus, the condition is:\n$$\n(\\tilde{p} + w_1) - (\\tilde{p} + w_2) = v \\quad \\text{for some } v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $w_1 - w_2 = v$.\nFor $\\exp_p$ to be injective on $B_r(0)$, there must not be any pair of distinct vectors $w_1, w_2 \\in B_r(0)$ whose difference is a non-zero lattice vector. The set of all possible differences $w_1 - w_2$ for $w_1, w_2 \\in B_r(0)$ is the open ball $B_{2r}(0)$. Therefore, the condition for injectivity on $B_r(0)$ is that $B_{2r}(0)$ contains no non-zero lattice vectors:\n$$\nB_{2r}(0) \\cap (\\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset\n$$\nThis is equivalent to requiring that for every $v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}$, its norm must be greater than or equal to the radius of this ball, i.e., $\\|v\\| \\ge 2r$. The supremum of $r$ values satisfying this condition is found by taking the equality for the shortest lattice vector:\n$$\n2r = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v\\|\n$$\nThus, the injectivity radius is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^n) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v\\|\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the lattice $\\Lambda$ and is independent of the point $p$.\n\nNext, we explain how the cut locus $C(p)$ is determined. The cut locus of $p$ is the set of points $q$ for which there is no unique minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$.\nLet $q = \\exp_p(w)$ for some $w \\in T_pT^n$. The geodesic segment from $p$ to $q$ is $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(tw)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Its length is $\\|w\\|$. This geodesic is minimizing if its length equals the Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$.\nThe distance $d(p,q)$ is the infimum of lengths of all paths from $p$ to $q$. Any such path lifts to a path in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ starting at $\\tilde{p}$ and ending at a lift of $q$. Let's set $\\tilde{q} = \\tilde{p}+w$. The set of all lifts of $q$ is $\\{\\tilde{q}+v \\mid v \\in \\Lambda\\}$. The distance is:\n$$\nd(p,q) = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} d_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}+v) = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|\\tilde{p} - (\\tilde{p}+w+v)\\| = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|-w-v\\| = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|w+v\\|\n$$\nSince $\\Lambda$ is a group, $\\{w+v \\mid v \\in \\Lambda\\}$ is the same set as $\\{w-v \\mid v \\in \\Lambda\\}$. So, $d(p,q) = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|w-v\\|$.\nThe geodesic segment of length $\\|w\\|$ is minimizing if and only if $\\|w\\| = d(p,q)$, which means:\n$$\n\\|w\\| \\le \\|w-v\\| \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in \\Lambda\n$$\nThis inequality defines the Voronoi cell (or Dirichlet domain) of the origin in the lattice $\\Lambda$, let's call it $W_0$.\n$$\nW_0 = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\|x\\| \\le \\|x-v\\| \\text{ for all } v \\in \\Lambda\\}\n$$\nThe inequality $\\|x\\| \\le \\|x-v\\|$ is equivalent to $\\|x\\|^2 \\le \\|x-v\\|^2 = \\|x\\|^2 - 2\\langle x, v \\rangle + \\|v\\|^2$, which simplifies to $2\\langle x, v \\rangle \\le \\|v\\|^2$. This shows that $W_0$ is a convex polytope defined by the intersection of half-spaces.\n\nThe cut locus $C(p)$ is the closure of the set of points $q=\\exp_p(w)$ where this minimizing property fails for the first time, or where uniqueness fails. Uniqueness of the minimizing geodesic fails if there is some non-zero $v_0 \\in \\Lambda$ for which $\\|w\\| = \\|w-v_0\\|$. This corresponds to $w$ being on the boundary of the Voronoi cell, $\\partial W_0$. For such a $w$, there are at least two minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$: one lifted to the segment from $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{p}+w$, and another lifted to the segment from $\\tilde{p}+v_0$ to $\\tilde{p}+w$. Both paths in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ have the same length and project to minimizing geodesics in $T^n$.\nTherefore, the cut locus of $p$ is the image of the boundary of the Voronoi cell under the exponential map:\n$$\nC(p) = \\exp_p(\\partial W_0) = \\pi(\\tilde{p} + \\partial W_0)\n$$\nThe structure of the cut locus is thus the projection of the boundary of the Voronoi cell of the lattice, translated to be centered at a lift of $p$. The injectivity radius is the shortest distance from $p$ to its cut locus, which is $\\min_{w \\in \\partial W_0} \\|w\\| = \\frac{1}{2}\\min_{v \\in \\Lambda\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\|v\\|$, consistent with our earlier derivation.\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific case: $n=2$, with lattice $\\Lambda$ generated by $v_1 = (3,0)$ and $v_2 = (1,2)$.\nA general lattice vector is $v = m v_1 + k v_2$ for integers $m, k$.\n$$\nv = m(3,0) + k(1,2) = (3m+k, 2k)\n$$\nWe need to compute $\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v\\|$.

We will proceed by analyzing the relationship between $RP^{n}$ and its universal Riemannian covering space, the unit sphere $S^{n}$.\n\nThe Real Projective Space $RP^{n}$ is defined as the quotient of the unit sphere $S^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by the antipodal map $A: x \\mapsto -x$. The projection map is $\\pi: S^{n} \\to RP^{n}$, where $\\pi(x) = [x] = \\{x, -x\\}$. The metric on $RP^{n}$ is the unique Riemannian metric that makes $\\pi$ a local isometry. This implies that $\\pi$ is a $2$-to-$1$ covering map.\n\nGeodesics in $RP^{n}$ are the projections of geodesics in $S^{n}$. Geodesics in the unit sphere $S^{n}$ are great circles. A unit-speed geodesic $\\tilde{\\gamma}: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^{n}$ starting at $x \\in S^{n}$ with initial velocity $v \\in T_xS^{n}$ (where $\\|v\\|=1$) is given by $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = \\cos(t)x + \\sin(t)v$.

A geodesic segment on $S^{n}$ is globally minimizing if and only if its length is less than or equal to $\\pi$.\n\nThe distance $d_{RP^{n}}([p], [q])$ between two points $[p]$ and $[q]$ in $RP^{n}$ is the shortest length of a path connecting them. Since paths in $RP^{n}$ can be lifted to paths in $S^{n}$ starting at either $p$ or $-p$ and ending at either $q$ or $-q$, the distance is given by:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([p], [q]) = \\min \\{d_{S^{n}}(p, q), d_{S^{n}}(p, -q)\\}\n$$\nUsing the property that $d_{S^{n}}(p, -q) = \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(p, q)$, the distance formula becomes:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([p], [q]) = \\min \\{d_{S^{n}}(p, q), \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(p, q)\\}\n$$\nThis shows that the maximum possible distance between any two points in $RP^{n}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ in $RP^{n}$ starting at $[x] = \\pi(x)$. We can lift this geodesic to a unique unit-speed geodesic $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ in $S^{n}$ starting at $x$. Since $\\pi$ is a local isometry, the length of the geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0, L]}$ is equal to the length of its lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}|_{[0, L]}$, which is $L$. For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is a minimizing geodesic in $S^{n}$, so $d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = t$.\n\nThe geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0, t]}$ is globally minimizing if its length, which is $t$, equals the distance between its endpoints, $d_{RP^{n}}([x], \\gamma(t))$. Let's compute this distance:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([x], \\gamma(t)) = d_{RP^{n}}(\\pi(x), \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))) = \\min \\{d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)), d_{S^{n}}(x, -\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\}\n$$\nWe have $d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = t$. The distance to the antipode of the endpoint is $d_{S^{n}}(x, -\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\pi - t$.\nTherefore, the distance between the endpoints of $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([x], \\gamma(t)) = \\min\\{t, \\pi - t\\}\n$$\nThe geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is minimizing if its length $t$ is equal to this distance. The equality $t = \\min\\{t, \\pi - t\\}$ holds if and only if $t \\le \\pi - t$, which simplifies to $2t \\le \\pi$, or $t \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFor any $t > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the length of the geodesic segment is $t$, but the distance between its endpoints is $\\pi - t < t$. Thus, for any time $t > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is no longer a globally minimizing path. This justifies why a unit-speed geodesic ceases to be globally minimizing after time $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}([x])$ is the supremum of radii $r>0$ for which all radial geodesics of length less than $r$ initiating from $[x]$ are globally minimizing. Based on our analysis, this value is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The injectivity radius can also be defined as the lesser of two values: the distance to the cut locus and half the length of the shortest non-trivial geodesic loop. The cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}([x])$ is the set of points where geodesics from $[x]$ first lose their minimizing property. This occurs at a distance of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for all geodesics. The shortest non-trivial geodesic loop at $[x]$ is the projection of the geodesic from $x$ to $-x$ in $S^{n}$, which has length $\\pi$. Half of this length is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Both definitions consistently yield $\\operatorname{inj}([x]) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFinally, we justify why there are multiple minimizing geodesics to points on the cut locus. A point $[y]$ belongs to the cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}([x])$ if $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y]) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Let us choose a lift $x \\in S^{n}$ for $[x]$ and $y \\in S^{n}$ for $[y]$.\nThe condition $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y]) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ implies $\\min\\{d_{S^{n}}(x, y), \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(x, y)\\} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This equality is satisfied if and only if $d_{S^{n}}(x, y) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Geometrically, this means that the point $y$ lies on the \"equator\" of $S^{n}$ with respect to the \"pole\" $x$.\nFor such a pair of points, we also have $d_{S^{n}}(x, -y) = \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(x, y) = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, consider two distinct geodesics in $S^{n}$ starting at $x$:\n1. $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1$: the unique minimizing geodesic from $x$ to $y$. Its length is $d_{S^{n}}(x, y) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n2. $\\tilde{\\gamma}_2$: the unique minimizing geodesic from $x$ to $-y$. Its length is $d_{S^{n}}(x, -y) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nLet us project these geodesics to $RP^{n}$:\n1. $\\gamma_1(t) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}_1(t))$ is a geodesic in $RP^{n}$ connecting $[x]$ to $[y]$. Its length is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is equal to $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y])$. Thus, $\\gamma_1$ is a minimizing geodesic.\n2. $\\gamma_2(t) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}_2(t))$ is a geodesic in $RP^{n}$ connecting $[x]$ to $\\pi(-y) = [y]$. Its length is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is also equal to $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y])$. Thus, $\\gamma_2$ is also a minimizing geodesic.\n\nThe two geodesics $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are distinct because their initial velocity vectors are different. Let $\\tilde{v}_1 = \\tilde{\\gamma}_1'(0)$ and $\\tilde{v}_2 = \\tilde{\\gamma}_2'(0)$ be the initial velocities in $T_xS^{n}$. Since their endpoints $y = \\exp_x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\tilde{v}_1)$ and $-y = \\exp_x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\tilde{v}_2)$ are distinct, and the exponential map on $S^{n}$ is injective on the open ball of radius $\\pi$, we must have $\\tilde{v}_1 \\neq \\tilde{v}_2$. The map $d\\pi_x: T_xS^{n} \\to T_{[x]}RP^{n}$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, the initial velocities of the projected geodesics, $v_1 = d\\pi_x(\\tilde{v}_1)$ and $v_2 = d\\pi_x(\\tilde{v}_2)$, are also distinct. This confirms that $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are two distinct minimizing geodesics in $RP^{n}$ connecting $[x]$ to the point $[y]$ in its cut locus.\n\nThe injectivity radius is constant for all points $[x] \\in RP^{n}$ because $RP^{n}$ is a homogeneous space.

If $q$ is a point on the cut locus such that $d(p,q) = d_{meet}(p)$ and $q$ is not a conjugate point to $p$, then there exist at least two minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$. The loop formed by these two geodesics can be shown to belong to a non-trivial homotopy class in the space of loops at $p$. Within this homotopy class, there must exist a geodesic loop whose length is less than or equal to the length of the original piecewise-geodesic loop, which is $2 \\cdot d(p,q) = 2 \\cdot d_{meet}(p)$.\nTherefore, the length of the shortest nontrivial geodesic loop, $L_{min}(p)$, provides an upper bound on $2 \\cdot d_{meet}(p)$, from which we deduce a lower bound for $d_{meet}(p)$:\n$$ L_{min}(p) \\leq 2 \\cdot d_{meet}(p) $$\nRearranging this inequality, we have:\n$$ d_{meet}(p) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} L_{min}(p) $$\nUsing the given hypothesis $L_{min}(p) \\geq \\dfrac{3\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}$, we obtain:\n$$ d_{meet}(p) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} \\right) = \\frac{3\\pi}{2\\sqrt{K}} $$\n\nFinally, we combine the two bounds to find the lower bound for the injectivity radius.\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) \\geq \\min\\left( d_{conj}(p), d_{meet}(p) \\right) $$\nSubstituting the lower bounds we derived for each term:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) \\geq \\min\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2\\sqrt{K}} \\right) $$\nSince $K > 0$, we simply need to compare the numerical factors $1$ and $\\dfrac{3}{2}$. As $1 < \\dfrac{3}{2}$, we have $\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} < \\dfrac{3\\pi}{2\\sqrt{K}}$.\nThe minimum of the two values is therefore $\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}$.\n\nThis leads to the final lower bound for the injectivity radius:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) \\geq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} $$\nThis is the most stringent conclusion that can be drawn from the given hypotheses alone. The curvature condition provides a stronger constraint on the injectivity radius than the provided condition on the length of geodesic loops.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}}\n$$", "id": "3043471"}]}
