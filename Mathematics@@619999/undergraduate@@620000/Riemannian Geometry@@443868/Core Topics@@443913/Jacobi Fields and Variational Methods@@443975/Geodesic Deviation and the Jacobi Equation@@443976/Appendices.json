Riemann Curvature Operator $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}$**\n\nFirst, we characterize the geodesic $\\gamma(s)$ and its velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(s)$. It is given as a unit-speed radial geodesic, with $s$ being the arc-length parameter.\n\"Radial\" implies that the angle $\\theta$ is constant, so $\\theta(s) = \\theta_0$ for some constant $\\theta_0$. This means $\\frac{d\\theta}{ds} = 0$.\nThe velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = \\frac{dr}{ds}\\partial_r + \\frac{d\\theta}{ds}\\partial_\\theta = \\frac{dr}{ds}\\partial_r$.\nThe \"unit-speed\" condition is $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 1$.\n$$\ng\\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\partial_r, \\frac{dr}{ds}\\partial_r\\right) = g_{rr} \\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\right)^2 = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\right)^2 = 1\n$$\nThis gives $\\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\right)^2 = 1$. Since $r(s)$ is given to be strictly increasing, we must have $\\frac{dr}{ds} = 1$.\nThus, the velocity vector field along the geodesic is $\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = \\partial_r$. Let's denote this by $T = \\partial_r$.\n\nThe vector field $J(s)$ along $\\gamma(s)$ can be written in the coordinate basis as $J(s) = J^r(s)\\partial_r + J^\\theta(s)\\partial_\\theta$.\n\nWe need to compute $R(J, T)T$. Using the tensorial properties of the Riemann curvature tensor $R$:\n$$\nR(J, T)T = R(J^r\\partial_r + J^\\theta\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_r)\\partial_r = J^r R(\\partial_r, \\partial_r)\\partial_r + J^\\theta R(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_r)\\partial_r\n$$\nBy the skew-symmetry of $R$ in its first two arguments, $R(\\partial_r, \\partial_r)\\partial_r = 0$. So we only need to compute the second term:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = J^\\theta(s) R(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_r)\\partial_r\n$$\nThe Riemann curvature operator is defined as $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$. For coordinate basis vectors, the Lie bracket is zero: $[\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_r] = 0.\nSo, $R(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_r)\\partial_r = \\nabla_{\\partial_\\theta} \\nabla_{\\partial_r} \\partial_r - \\nabla_{\\partial_r} \\nabla_{\\partial_\\theta} \\partial_r$.\n\nWe use the formula for the covariant derivative of a basis vector field $\\nabla_{\\partial_i}\\partial_j = \\Gamma^k_{ij}\\partial_k$.\nFirst term:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_r} \\partial_r = \\Gamma^k_{rr}\\partial_k = \\Gamma^r_{rr}\\partial_r + \\Gamma^\\theta_{rr}\\partial_\\theta = 0\\cdot\\partial_r + 0\\cdot\\partial_\\theta = 0\n$$\nSo, $\\nabla_{\\partial_\\theta} (\\nabla_{\\partial_r} \\partial_r) = \\nabla_{\\partial_\\theta} (0) = 0$.\n\nSecond term:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_\\theta} \\partial_r = \\Gamma^k_{\\theta r}\\partial_k = \\Gamma^r_{\\theta r}\\partial_r + \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r}\\partial_\\theta = 0\\cdot\\partial_r + \\frac{1}{r}\\partial_\\theta = \\frac{1}{r}\\partial_\\theta\n$$\nNow we compute its covariant derivative with respect to $\\partial_r$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_r} (\\nabla_{\\partial_\\theta} \\partial_r) = \\nabla_{\\partial_r} \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\partial_\\theta\\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for covariant differentiation, $\\nabla_X(fY) = (Xf)Y + f\\nabla_X Y$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_r} \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = \\left(\\partial_r \\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\nabla_{\\partial_r}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = -\\frac{1}{r^2}\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\Gamma^k_{r\\theta}\\partial_k\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= -\\frac{1}{r^2}\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r}(\\Gamma^r_{r\\theta}\\partial_r + \\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}\\partial_\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{r^2}\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(0\\cdot\\partial_r + \\frac{1}{r}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = -\\frac{1}{r^2}\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\partial_\\theta = 0\n$$\nCombining the terms, we find:\n$$\nR(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_r)\\partial_r = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the curvature operator acting on $J$ is:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = J^\\theta(s) \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe result is the zero vector. This is expected, as the metric is the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ expressed in polar coordinates, which describes a flat space. A flat space has a vanishing Riemann curvature tensor.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Geodesic Deviation Equation (Jacobi Equation)**\n\nLet $\\alpha: (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times [a,b] \\to M$ be a smooth one-parameter family of geodesics, called a variation of geodesics. Let $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ be the variation parameter and $s \\in [a,b]$ be the arc-length parameter for each geodesic. The vector fields associated with the variation are the tangent vector field $T = \\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial s}$ and the variation vector field $J = \\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial t}$. We evaluate along the central geodesic $\\gamma(s) = \\alpha(s,0)$.\n\nThe condition that each curve $\\alpha(s, t)$ for fixed $t$ is a geodesic is $\\nabla_T T = 0$.\nThe Jacobi equation describes how $J$ changes along a geodesic. To find this, we examine how the geodesic condition changes as we vary $t$. We compute the covariant derivative of $\\nabla_T T = 0$ with respect to $J$:\n$$\n\\nabla_J(\\nabla_T T) = 0\n$$\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is defined by the commutation relation of covariant derivatives: $R(J,T)T = \\nabla_J \\nabla_T T - \\nabla_T \\nabla_J T - \\nabla_{[J,T]} T$.\nThe vector fields $T=\\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial s}$ and $J=\\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial t}$ arise from a coordinate chart $(s,t)$ on the surface of variation, so their Lie bracket vanishes: $[J,T] = 0$.\nUsing this and $\\nabla_J(\\nabla_T T) = 0$, the curvature definition becomes:\n$$\nR(J,T)T = 0 - \\nabla_T \\nabla_J T - 0 = - \\nabla_T \\nabla_J T\n$$\nThe torsion-free property of the Levi-Civita connection implies $\\nabla_J T - \\nabla_T J = [J,T]$. Since $[J,T] = 0$, we have $\\nabla_J T = \\nabla_T J$.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation:\n$$\nR(J,T)T = - \\nabla_T(\\nabla_T J)\n$$\nRearranging this gives the geodesic deviation equation, or Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_T \\nabla_T J + R(J,T)T = 0\n$$\nReplacing $T$ with $\\dot{\\gamma}$, the equation is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + R(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$.\n\nFor the specific metric given in this problem, we have already computed that $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. Therefore, the Jacobi equation for a Jacobi field $J(s)$ along a radial geodesic $\\gamma(s)$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J = 0\n$$\nThis indicates that the \"acceleration\" of the separation vector $J$ is zero, which is characteristic of geodesic deviation in a flat space.\n\nThe question asks for the fully simplified analytic expression for $R(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}$ along $\\gamma(s)$.

Derive the scalar second-order ODE for the coefficient function $y(t)$ in terms of the Gaussian curvature sampled along the geodesic.\n- You must set up the initial value problem for $y(t)$ with the initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 1$, and integrate it numerically over a prescribed interval $t \\in [0, t_{\\max}]$. Treat $t$ as arc-length, so all reported distances are dimensionless numbers.\n\nSurfaces and metrics for the test suite:\n- Case $1$ (constant positive curvature): The round $2$-sphere of radius $R = 2$ with its standard metric. Consider a unit-speed great-circle geodesic (for example, the equator). The Gaussian curvature is spatially constant with value $K = \\frac{1}{R^{2}}$, sampled along the geodesic.\n- Case $2$ (zero curvature): The Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with its standard metric. Consider a unit-speed straight-line geodesic. The Gaussian curvature is spatially constant with value $K = 0$, sampled along the geodesic.\n- Case $3$ (constant negative curvature): The hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré half-plane model with metric $\\mathrm{d}s^{2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{2} + \\mathrm{d}y^{2}}{y^{2}}$. Consider a unit-speed vertical geodesic. The Gaussian curvature is spatially constant with value $K = -1$, sampled along the geodesic.\n\nNumerical tasks:\n- For each case, set up the scalar ODE for $y(t)$ implied by the geodesic deviation in the parallel frame along the given geodesic, using the Gaussian curvature sampled along that geodesic. Integrate numerically from $t = 0$ to $t = t_{\\max} = 20$ with initial conditions $y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 1$.\n- Detect the zeros of $y(t)$ in the open interval $(0, t_{\\max}]$ and compute the spacings between consecutive zeros. If there are fewer than two zeros in $(0, t_{\\max}]$, the spacing list is empty.\n\nTest suite:\n- Use the following parameter sets, each specified by its constant Gaussian curvature value and integration horizon:\n    - Case $1$: $K = \\frac{1}{4}$, $t_{\\max} = 20$.\n    - Case $2$: $K = 0$, $t_{\\max} = 20$.\n    - Case $3$: $K = -1$, $t_{\\max} = 20$.\n\nAnswer specification and output format:\n- For each case, output the list of spacings between consecutive zeros of $y(t)$ in $(0, t_{\\max}]$, as a list of floating-point numbers. All distances are dimensionless.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each entry corresponds to one test case and is itself a list of floating-point spacings. For example, the final output must look like $[\\,[\\dots],\\,[\\dots],\\,[\\dots]\\,]$ with no spaces after commas. Concretely, your program must print something like $[[s_{1,1},s_{1,2},\\dots],[\\ ],[\\ ]]$, where $s_{i,j}$ denotes the $j$-th spacing for the $i$-th case, and empty lists are printed for cases with fewer than two zeros.", "solution": "The analysis begins with the Jacobi equation, which describes the evolution of a Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$. A Jacobi field measures the infinitesimal separation between nearby geodesics. Let $T(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ be the unit tangent vector to the geodesic, where $t$ is the arc-length parameter. The Jacobi equation is:\n$$ \\nabla_{T} \\nabla_{T} J + R(J, T) T = 0 $$\nHere, $\\nabla_{T}$ is the covariant derivative along the geodesic and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nOn a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold (a surface), we can simplify this equation. We are interested in how geodesics deviate in the direction normal to themselves. We construct a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{T(t), E(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma(t)$. Here, $T(t)$ is the unit tangent vector, and $E(t)$ is a unit vector field orthogonal to $T(t)$ (i.e., $g(T, E) = 0$, $g(E, E) = 1$). The frame is parallel-transported, which means $\\nabla_T T = 0$ (the geodesic equation) and $\\nabla_T E = 0$.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ can be decomposed into tangential and normal components. A normal Jacobi field, which represents deviation perpendicular to the direction of travel, is written as:\n$$ J(t) = y(t) E(t) $$\nwhere $y(t)$ is a scalar function representing the magnitude of the deviation.\n\nWe now substitute this form of $J(t)$ into the Jacobi equation. We compute the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$ using the Leibniz rule for covariant differentiation:\n$$ \\nabla_T J = \\nabla_T (y(t) E(t)) = (\\nabla_T y) E + y (\\nabla_T E) $$\nSince $y(t)$ is a scalar function, its covariant derivative is its ordinary derivative with respect to $t$, $\\nabla_T y = \\frac{dy}{dt} = y'(t)$. By construction of our frame, $\\nabla_T E = 0$. Thus, the first derivative is:\n$$ \\nabla_T J = y'(t) E(t) $$\nTaking the second covariant derivative:\n$$ \\nabla_T \\nabla_T J = \\nabla_T (y'(t) E(t)) = (\\nabla_T y') E + y' (\\nabla_T E) = y''(t) E(t) $$\n\nNext, we analyze the curvature term, $R(J, T) T$. For a 2D manifold, the Riemann tensor's action on an orthonormal basis $\\{X, Y\\}$ is given by $R(X, Y)Y = K X$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature.\nIn our case, the orthonormal basis is $\\{T, E\\}$, so $R(T, E)E = K T$. Using the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, $R(E, T)T = -R(T, E)T$. A more direct formula for the Riemann tensor on a 2D surface is $R(X, Y)Z = K(g(Y, Z)X - g(X, Z)Y)$.\nSubstituting $J(t) = y(t)E(t)$ into the curvature term:\n$$ R(J, T) T = R(y(t)E(t), T(t)) T(t) = y(t) R(E, T) T $$\nUsing the general formula with $X=E, Y=T, Z=T$:\n$$ R(E, T) T = K(g(T, T)E - g(E, T)T) $$\nSince $\\{T, E\\}$ is an orthonormal frame, $g(T, T)=1$ and $g(E, T)=0$. This simplifies to:\n$$ R(E, T)T = K(1 \\cdot E - 0 \\cdot T) = K E $$\nSo, the curvature term becomes:\n$$ R(J, T) T = y(t) K(\\gamma(t)) E(t) $$\nwhere $K(\\gamma(t))$ is the Gaussian curvature at the point $\\gamma(t)$.\n\nSubstituting the second derivative and the curvature term back into the Jacobi equation:\n$$ y''(t) E(t) + y(t) K(\\gamma(t)) E(t) = 0 $$\n$$ (y''(t) + K(\\gamma(t)) y(t)) E(t) = 0 $$\nSince $E(t)$ is a non-zero vector, its coefficient must be zero. This yields the scalar second-order ordinary differential equation for geodesic deviation:\n$$ y''(t) + K(\\gamma(t)) y(t) = 0 $$\n\n**Problem Specifics and Numerical Approach**\n\nThe problem specifies three cases where the Gaussian curvature $K$ is constant along the geodesic. The ODE simplifies to a linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We must solve the initial value problem (IVP):\n$$ y''(t) + K y(t) = 0, \\quad y(0) = 0, \\quad y'(0) = 1 $$\n\nThe behavior of the solutions depends on the sign of $K$:\n1.  **Case 1: Positive Curvature ($K > 0$)**: Let $K = \\omega^2$. The equation is $y'' + \\omega^2 y = 0$. The solution is $y(t) = \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\sin(\\omega t)$. This solution is oscillatory, crossing zero at $t = n\\pi/\\omega$ for integer $n$. These zeros are called conjugate points and physically represent points where families of geodesics refocus. The spacing between consecutive zeros is constant, $\\Delta t = \\pi/\\omega$. For $K = 1/4$, $\\omega = 1/2$, so the spacing is $2\\pi$.\n\n2.  **Case 2: Zero Curvature ($K = 0$)**: The equation is $y'' = 0$. The solution is $y(t) = t$. The only zero is at $t = 0$. Geodesics diverge linearly, a familiar property of Euclidean space.\n\n3.  **Case 3: Negative Curvature ($K  0$)**: Let $K = -\\alpha^2$. The equation is $y'' - \\alpha^2 y = 0$. The solution is $y(t) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\sinh(\\alpha t)$. The only zero is at $t=0$. Geodesics diverge exponentially, which is characteristic of hyperbolic geometry.\n\nTo solve this numerically, we convert the second-order ODE into a system of two first-order ODEs. Let the state vector be $\\vec{z}(t) = [z_1(t), z_2(t)]^T = [y(t), y'(t)]^T$. The system is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\vec{z}}{dt} = \\begin{pmatrix} z_2 \\\\ -K z_1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe initial condition is $\\vec{z}(0) = [0, 1]^T$.\n\nThis IVP is solved using a numerical integrator, specifically `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` in Python. We integrate from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\max}=20$ for each of the three given values of $K$: $1/4$, $0$, and $-1$.\n\nTo find the zeros of $y(t)$ in the interval $(0, t_{\\max}]$, we use the event detection feature of `solve_ivp`. An event function, which simply returns the value of $y(t)$ (i.e., $z_1(t)$), is supplied to the solver. The solver then finds all roots of this function during the integration. The list of root times is post-processed to exclude the initial point $t=0$ and to compute the differences between consecutive positive roots. If fewer than two positive roots are found, the list of spacings is empty, as per the problem specification.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{[[6.283185307179586, 6.283185307179586], [], []]}\n$$", "id": "3047795"}]}
