The problem statement links the concept to the second variation of energy, which is given by the index form. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the index form functional yields the Jacobi equation.\n\nLet $\\gamma:[0,T]\\to M$ be a unit-speed geodesic in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Let $J$ be a smooth vector field along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(T)=0$.

The solutions for $t_c$ are $t_c = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. The problem asks for the smallest positive $t_c$. This corresponds to $n=1$.\nThus, the first conjugate distance is $t_c=\\pi$.\n\n**Part 2: Minimal Value of the Normalized Index Form**\n\nThe index form $I(V,W)$ for two normal vector fields $V, W$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ which vanish at the endpoints is given by:\n$$ I(V,W) = \\int_0^L \\left( \\langle D_t V, D_t W \\rangle - \\langle R(V,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, W \\rangle \\right) dt $$\nWe are interested in $I(V,V)$ for $V(t) = f(t)E(t)$, where $f(0)=f(L)=0$.\nFirst, we compute the term $\\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle$:\n$$ D_t V = D_t(f(t)E(t)) = f'(t)E(t) + f(t)D_t E(t) = f'(t)E(t) $$\nsince $E(t)$ is parallel along $\\gamma$. Then,\n$$ \\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle = \\langle f'(t)E(t), f'(t)E(t) \\rangle = (f'(t))^2 \\langle E(t), E(t) \\rangle = (f'(t))^2 $$\nsince $E(t)$ is a unit vector.\n\nNext, we compute the curvature term $\\langle R(V,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle$. For $K=1$:\n$$ R(V,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\langle \\dot{\\gamma},\\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle V - \\langle V,\\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} $$\nSince $\\gamma$ is unit speed, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma},\\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle=1$. Since $V$ is a normal field, $\\langle V, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = 0$. This simplifies to:\n$$ R(V,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = V $$\nTherefore, the curvature term in the integrand is:\n$$ \\langle R(V,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle = \\langle V, V \\rangle = \\langle f(t)E(t), f(t)E(t) \\rangle = (f(t))^2 \\langle E(t), E(t) \\rangle = (f(t))^2 $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for the index form, we obtain the one-dimensional functional of $f$:\n$$ I(V,V) = I(f) = \\int_0^L \\left( (f'(t))^2 - (f(t))^2 \\right) dt $$\nWe need to find the minimum value of this functional subject to the normalization condition $\\int_0^L |V(t)|^2 dt = \\int_0^L (f(t))^2 dt = 1$.\nThis is a standard problem in the calculus of variations, equivalent to finding the smallest eigenvalue of the associated Sturm-Liouville problem. We seek to minimize the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{\\int_0^L (f'^2 - f^2) dt}{\\int_0^L f^2 dt} $$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional $\\int_0^L (f'^2 - (1+\\lambda)f^2) dt$ is:\n$$ f''(t) + (1+\\lambda)f(t) = 0 $$\nLet $\\omega^2 = 1+\\lambda$. The equation is $f'' + \\omega^2 f = 0$. The boundary conditions are $f(0)=0$ and $f(L)=0$.\nThe general solution for $\\omega^2  0$ is $f(t) = C_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n$f(0)=0 \\implies C_1=0$.\n$f(L)=0 \\implies C_2 \\sin(\\omega L)=0$. For a non-trivial solution, $C_2 \\neq 0$, so we must have $\\sin(\\omega L)=0$.\nThis implies $\\omega L = n\\pi$ for a positive integer $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nSo, $\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$.\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are given by $\\lambda_n = \\omega_n^2 - 1 = \\left( \\frac{n\\pi}{L} \\right)^2 - 1$.\nThe minimum value of the normalized index form corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue, which occurs for $n=1$:\n$$ \\min I(V,V) = \\lambda_1 = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\right)^2 - 1 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} - 1 $$\nThis minimal value is achieved for the eigenfunction $f_1(t) = C_2 \\sin(\\frac{\\pi t}{L})$.\n\nThis expression allows us to analyze the stability of the geodesic $\\gamma$ over the interval $[0,L]$. The index of the geodesic is positive (i.e., it is not minimizing) if and only if the minimal value of the index form is negative.\n- If $L  \\pi$, then $L^2  \\pi^2$, so $\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}  1$. The minimal value $\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}-1$ is positive. Thus, $I(V,V)0$ for all admissible non-zero $V$, and the geodesic is stable (a local minimum of length).\n- If $L = \\pi$, then $L^2 = \\pi^2$, so $\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} = 1$. The minimal value is $0$. This corresponds to the existence of a Jacobi field vanishing at the endpoints, confirming that $L=\\pi$ is the first conjugate distance.\n- If $L  \\pi$, then $L^2  \\pi^2$, so $\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}  1$. The minimal value is negative. This means there exists a variation field $V$ which makes $I(V,V)0$, so the geodesic is no longer a local minimum of length.\n\nThe final answer consists of the first conjugate distance $t_c$ and the minimal normalized index value as a function of $L$.\n$t_c = \\pi$.\nMinimal value of $I(V,V)$ = $\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} - 1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi  \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} - 1 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3064605"}]}
