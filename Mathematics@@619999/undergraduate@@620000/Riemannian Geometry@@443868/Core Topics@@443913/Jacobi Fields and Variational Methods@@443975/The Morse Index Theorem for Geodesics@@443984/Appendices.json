The associated Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is characterized by the property that for any vector fields $X, Y$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X Y$ is just the directional derivative of the components of $Y$ in the direction of $X$.

The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = v$, which is a constant vector.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a vector field that satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$ \\nabla_t^2 J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\nabla_t$ denotes the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, i.e., $\\nabla_t J(t) = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} J(t)$.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Jacobi Equation in Euclidean Space**\n\nIn Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_t$ of a vector field $J(t)$ along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is simply the ordinary derivative of its components with respect to $t$. That is, if $J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n J_i(t) e_i$, where $\\{e_i\\}$ is the standard basis, then $\\nabla_t J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{d J_i}{dt} e_i = \\frac{dJ}{dt}$.\nConsequently, the second covariant derivative is the second ordinary derivative:\n$$ \\nabla_t^2 J(t) = \\nabla_t (\\nabla_t J(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{dJ}{dt}\\right) = \\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} $$\nAs stated in the problem's premises, the curvature tensor $R$ of Euclidean space is identically zero. Therefore, the curvature term in the Jacobi equation vanishes:\n$$ R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0 $$\nSubstituting these results into the general Jacobi equation, we obtain the equation for a Jacobi field in $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} + 0 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} = 0 $$\n\n**Step 2: Explicit Solution of the Jacobi Equation**\n\nWe must solve the second-order ordinary differential equation $\\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} = 0$. Integrating once with respect to $t$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{dJ}{dt} = A $$\nwhere $A$ is a constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Integrating a second time yields:\n$$ J(t) = At + B $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus, any Jacobi field along a geodesic in Euclidean space is a linear function of time.\n\n**Step 3: Characterization of Orthogonal Jacobi Fields**\n\nWe are asked to characterize the Jacobi fields $J(t)$ that are everywhere orthogonal to the velocity vector of the geodesic, $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = v$. The orthogonality condition is $\\langle J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$:\n$$ \\langle At + B, v \\rangle = 0 $$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product:\n$$ t \\langle A, v \\rangle + \\langle B, v \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis equation is a polynomial in $t$ and must hold for all $t \\in [0,L]$. This is only possible if the coefficients of the powers of $t$ are all zero. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ \\langle A, v \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle B, v \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis means that the constant vectors $A$ and $B$ must both be orthogonal to the direction vector $v$ of the geodesic. So, a Jacobi field $J(t)=At+B$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ if and only if $A, B \\in (\\text{span}\\{v\\})^\\perp$.\n\n**Step 4: Existence of Conjugate Points**\n\nA point $\\gamma(t_0)$ for $t_0  0$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ (i.e., $J(t)$ is not identically zero) such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(t_0) = 0$.\n\nThe problem asks to investigate this using the characterization of orthogonal fields, but we will first address the general case for completeness. Let $J(t) = At + B$ be any Jacobi field.\nThe condition $J(0) = 0$ implies:\n$$ A(0) + B = 0 \\implies B = 0 $$\nSo, the Jacobi field must be of the form $J(t) = At$. For the field to be non-trivial, we must have $A \\neq 0$.\nNow, we apply the second condition, $J(t_0) = 0$ for some $t_0 \\in (0,L]$:\n$$ A t_0 = 0 $$\nSince we are given $t_0 \\in (0,L]$, we know $t_0  0$. In a vector space, the product of a non-zero scalar ($t_0$) and a non-zero vector ($A$) cannot be the zero vector. Therefore, the equation $A t_0 = 0$ with $t_0  0$ implies that $A$ must be the zero vector, $A=0$.\nThis leads to $J(t) = 0t = 0$ for all $t$. This is the trivial Jacobi field.\nThus, there exists no non-trivial Jacobi field $J$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_0)=0$ for any $t_0  0$.\n\nIf we restrict ourselves to the Jacobi fields orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ as prompted, the same conclusion holds. If $J(t)$ is an orthogonal Jacobi field with $J(0)=0$, then $B=0$ and $J(t)=At$ where $\\langle A, v \\rangle = 0$. For $J$ to be non-trivial, we need $A \\neq 0$. The condition $J(t_0)=0$ for $t_0  0$ again leads to $A t_0 = 0$, which implies $A=0$, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there are no conjugate points along any geodesic in Euclidean space.\n\n**Step 5: The Morse Index**\n\nThe Morse index theorem for geodesics states that the index of the energy functional at a geodesic $\\gamma: [0,L] \\to M$, for variations with fixed endpoints $\\gamma(0)$ and $\\gamma(L)$, is equal to the number of conjugate points to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ in the open interval $(0,L)$, where each conjugate point is counted with its multiplicity. The multiplicity of a conjugate point $\\gamma(t_c)$ is the dimension of the vector space of Jacobi fields $J$ that vanish at both $t=0$ and $t=t_c$.\n\nAs established in Step 4, for any geodesic in Euclidean space, there are no conjugate points. The dimension of the space of Jacobi fields vanishing at $t=0$ and $t=t_c$ for any $t_c \\in (0, L)$ is $0$.\nConsequently, the count of conjugate points in the interval $(0,L)$ is zero.\n\nAccording to the Morse index theorem, the Morse index of the energy functional at the geodesic $\\gamma$ is this count. Therefore, the Morse index is $0$. This aligns with the geometric intuition that a straight line segment in Euclidean space is a global minimum for the length (and energy) functional among all paths connecting its endpoints, implying the second variation is positive definite (for non-trivial variations) and the index is zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3074834"}, {"introduction": "We now move from a flat world to one with constant positive curvature, the sphere $S^n$.

Normal component: $D_t^2 J^{\\perp}(t) + J^{\\perp}(t) = 0$\n\nWe solve these two equations and apply the periodic boundary conditions.\n\n**1. Tangential Jacobi Fields**\nThe equation $\\ddot{a}(t) = 0$ has the general solution $a(t) = c_1 t + c_2$ for constants $c_1, c_2$. The corresponding tangential field is $J_T(t) = (c_1 t + c_2)\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. We check the periodicity conditions for $J_T(t)$ on the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe geodesic $\\gamma$ is closed, so $\\gamma(0)=\\gamma(2\\pi)$, and its velocity is also periodic, $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=\\dot{\\gamma}(2\\pi)$.\nThe condition $J_T(0) = J_T(2\\pi)$ becomes:\n$$(c_1 \\cdot 0 + c_2)\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = (c_1 \\cdot 2\\pi + c_2)\\dot{\\gamma}(2\\pi)$$\n$$c_2 \\dot{\\gamma}(0) = (2\\pi c_1 + c_2)\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$$\nSince $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ is a non-zero vector, this implies $c_2 = 2\\pi c_1 + c_2$, which leads to $2\\pi c_1 = 0$, so $c_1=0$.\nThus, $a(t) = c_2$ must be a constant. The tangential field is $J_T(t) = c_2\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$.\nThe derivative is $D_t J_T(t) = D_t(c_2\\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = c_2 D_t \\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$, since $\\gamma$ is a geodesic. The derivative is thus automatically periodic ($0=0$).\nThe space of periodic tangential Jacobi fields consists of all constant multiples of $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. This is a $1$-dimensional space. This Jacobi field corresponds to the infinitesimal reparametrization of the loop $\\gamma(t) \\to \\gamma(t+s)$, whose variation field is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. This is the degeneracy arising from the time-shift symmetry of the energy functional $E$.\n\n**2. Normal Jacobi Fields**\nWe need to solve $D_t^2 J^{\\perp}(t) + J^{\\perp}(t) = 0$ subject to periodic boundary conditions. The normal bundle to $\\gamma$ in $T S^2$ is a $1$-dimensional bundle. Let $E_2(t)$ be a unit-length vector field along $\\gamma(t)$ that is normal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, i.e., $\\langle E_2(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ and $\\|E_2(t)\\|=1$. For a great circle on $S^2$, we can construct a parallel such field. For instance, if $\\gamma(t)$ is the equator, the vector field pointing to the north pole is a parallel normal field along $\\gamma$. In general, along a great circle, parallel transport is trivial in a suitable frame, so we can find a parallel normal field $E_2(t)$ such that $D_t E_2(t) = 0$.\nSince $E_2(t)$ is parallel-transported along a closed loop, $E_2(2\\pi)$ is related to $E_2(0)$ by the holonomy group of the connection. For a great circle on $S^2$, the holonomy is trivial, so $E_2(2\\pi) = E_2(0)$.\nAny normal field $J^{\\perp}(t)$ can be written as $J^{\\perp}(t) = f(t)E_2(t)$ for some scalar function $f(t)$.\nSince $E_2(t)$ is parallel, $D_t J^{\\perp} = \\dot{f}(t)E_2(t)$ and $D_t^2 J^{\\perp} = \\ddot{f}(t)E_2(t)$. The normal Jacobi equation becomes:\n$$\\ddot{f}(t)E_2(t) + f(t)E_2(t) = 0$$\n$$\\ddot{f}(t) + f(t) = 0$$\nThe general solution is $f(t) = c_3 \\cos(t) + c_4 \\sin(t)$ for constants $c_3, c_4$.\nSo, the normal Jacobi fields are of the form $J^{\\perp}(t) = (c_3 \\cos(t) + c_4 \\sin(t))E_2(t)$.\nLet's check the periodic boundary conditions:\n$J^{\\perp}(0) = (c_3 \\cos(0) + c_4 \\sin(0))E_2(0) = c_3 E_2(0)$.\n$J^{\\perp}(2\\pi) = (c_3 \\cos(2\\pi) + c_4 \\sin(2\\pi))E_2(2\\pi) = c_3 E_2(2\\pi)$.\nSince $E_2(0) = E_2(2\\pi)$, we have $J^{\\perp}(0) = J^{\\perp}(2\\pi)$ for any $c_3, c_4$.\nNow check the derivative: $D_t J^{\\perp}(t) = (-c_3 \\sin(t) + c_4 \\cos(t))E_2(t)$.\n$D_t J^{\\perp}(0) = c_4 E_2(0)$.\n$D_t J^{\\perp}(2\\pi) = c_4 E_2(2\\pi)$.\nSince $E_2(0) = E_2(2\\pi)$, we have $D_t J^{\\perp}(0) = D_t J^{\\perp}(2\\pi)$ for any $c_3, c_4$.\nAll boundary conditions are satisfied for any choice of $c_3, c_4$. Thus, the entire $2$-dimensional space of normal Jacobi fields is periodic. A basis for this space is given by $\\{\\cos(t)E_2(t), \\sin(t)E_2(t)\\}$. These Jacobi fields are generated by the action of the isometry group $O(3)$ of $S^2$. Specifically, they correspond to infinitesimal rotations about axes in the plane of the great circle.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe space of all periodic Jacobi fields along the great circle $\\gamma$ is the direct sum of the space of periodic tangential Jacobi fields and the space of periodic normal Jacobi fields.\n$$\\nu(\\gamma) = \\dim(\\text{periodic tangential fields}) + \\dim(\\text{periodic normal fields})$$\nWe found the dimension of the tangential part to be $1$ and the dimension of the normal part to be $2$.\nTherefore, the total nullity is:\n$$\\nu(\\gamma) = 1 + 2 = 3$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3074867"}]}
