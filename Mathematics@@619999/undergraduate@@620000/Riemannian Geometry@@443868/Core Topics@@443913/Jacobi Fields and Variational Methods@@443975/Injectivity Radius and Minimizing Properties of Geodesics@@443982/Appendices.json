The points are $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$. The Riemannian distance $d_M$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves in $M$ connecting two points.\n\n**Part 1: Incompleteness of $M$**\n\nA metric space $(X, d)$ is complete if every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges to a point in $X$. To demonstrate that $(M, d_M)$ is not complete, we must find a Cauchy sequence of points in $M$ that does not converge to a limit within $M$.\n\nConsider the sequence of points $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $M$ defined by $x_n = (\\frac{1}{n}, 0)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. For any $n \\ge 1$, $x_n \\neq (0,0)$, so $x_n \\in M$.\n\nTo show this is a Cauchy sequence, we must show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n, m > N$, the distance $d_M(x_n, x_m) < \\epsilon$. For any two points $x_n$ and $x_m$ with $n, m \\ge 1$, the straight line segment connecting them lies on the positive x-axis and does not pass through the origin $(0,0)$. Therefore, this line segment is a path in $M$, and its length is the standard Euclidean distance. The Riemannian distance $d_M(x_n, x_m)$ is thus equal to the Euclidean distance $d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(x_n, x_m)$.\nFor $m > n$, we have:\n$$d_M(x_n, x_m) = d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{n}, 0\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{m}, 0\\right)\\right) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m}$$\nAs $n, m \\to \\infty$, $d_M(x_n, x_m) \\to 0$. Thus, $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to the metric $d_M$.\n\nNow we check for convergence. In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to the point $(0,0)$ as $n \\to \\infty$. However, the point $(0,0)$ is explicitly excluded from the manifold $M$. Therefore, the Cauchy sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ does not have a limit in $M$. By definition, the metric space $(M, d_M)$ is not complete.\n\nThe classical Hopf–Rinow theorem states that for a connected Riemannian manifold, metric completeness is equivalent to geodesic completeness (the property that every geodesic can be extended to be defined for all real time). Since we have shown that $M$ is not complete as a metric space, the Hopf–Rinow theorem directly implies that $M$ is not geodesically complete. An example of an incomplete geodesic is $\\gamma(t) = (1-t, 0)$ for $t \\in [0, 1)$. This is a straight line starting at $(1,0)$ and moving towards the origin. It is a geodesic in $M$ for any subinterval of $[0,1)$, but it cannot be extended past $t=1$ because $\\gamma(1)=(0,0)$, which is not in $M$.\n\n**Part 2: Existence of a Minimizing Geodesic from $p$ to $q$**\n\nA minimizing geodesic between two points is a geodesic whose length is equal to the Riemannian distance between the points. The geodesics of $(M,g)$ are the same as the geodesics of $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g)$, which are straight lines, so long as they remain in $M$.\n\nIn the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the unique shortest path between $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$ is the straight line segment connecting them. This path can be parameterized by $\\gamma(t) = (2t-1, 0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. At the parameter value $t=\\frac{1}{2}$, this path passes through the point $\\gamma(\\frac{1}{2})=(0,0)$. Since $(0,0) \\notin M$, this straight line segment is not a valid curve in $M$.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not available in $M$. Another part of the Hopf–Rinow theorem states that in a complete Riemannian manifold, any two points can be connected by a (not necessarily unique) minimizing geodesic. Since $M$ is not complete, this guarantee does not apply.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a minimizing geodesic $\\gamma_0$ from $p$ to $q$ exists in $M$. Its length, $L(\\gamma_0)$, would have to be equal to the Riemannian distance $d_M(p,q)$. As we will compute in Part 3, $d_M(p,q)=2$. Thus, if a minimizing geodesic existed, it would have to be a curve in $M$ of length $2$. The only curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ between $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$ with length $2$ is the straight line segment between them. Since this segment is not in $M$, no curve *in* $M$ can have length $2$.\n\nThe infimum of the lengths of paths in $M$ between $p$ and $q$ is $2$, but this infimum is not attained by any specific path in $M$. Consequently, no minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$ exists in $M$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Riemannian distance $d_M(p,q)$**\n\nThe Riemannian distance $d_M(p,q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves in $M$ connecting $p$ to $q$.\n$$d_M(p,q) = \\inf \\{ L(\\gamma) \\mid \\gamma:[0,1] \\to M \\text{ is piecewise smooth, } \\gamma(0)=p, \\gamma(1)=q \\}$$\nwhere the length $L(\\gamma)$ is computed using the Euclidean metric.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound. Any curve $\\gamma$ in $M$ is also a curve in the larger space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The length of any curve between two points is always greater than or equal to the straight-line distance between them. The straight-line distance in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ between $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$ is:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(p,q) = \\sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2} = 2$$\nTherefore, for any admissible curve $\\gamma$ in $M$, its length $L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$. This implies that the infimum must also satisfy $d_M(p,q) \\ge 2$.\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound by constructing a family of curves in $M$ whose lengths approach $2$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, consider the path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ that consists of three parts:\n1.  The straight line segment from $p=(-1,0)$ to the point $p_\\epsilon = (-\\epsilon, 0)$. The length is $1-\\epsilon$.\n2.  The upper semicircle of radius $\\epsilon$ centered at the origin, from $(-\\epsilon, 0)$ to $(\\epsilon, 0)$. The length is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi\\epsilon) = \\pi\\epsilon$.\n3.  The straight line segment from $q_\\epsilon = (\\epsilon, 0)$ to $q=(1,0)$. The length is $1-\\epsilon$.\n\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, this path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ is a piecewise smooth curve that lies entirely within $M$. Its total length is:\n$$L(\\gamma_\\epsilon) = (1-\\epsilon) + \\pi\\epsilon + (1-\\epsilon) = 2 + (\\pi-2)\\epsilon$$\nSince we can find such a path for any $\\epsilon > 0$, the infimum of all path lengths, $d_M(p,q)$, must be less than or equal to the length of any of these specific paths.\n$$d_M(p,q) \\le L(\\gamma_\\epsilon) = 2 + (\\pi-2)\\epsilon$$\nThis inequality holds for all $\\epsilon > 0$. Since $\\pi - 2 > 0$, we can make the term $(\\pi-2)\\epsilon$ arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently small $\\epsilon$. Taking the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$ on the right side, we get:\n$$d_M(p,q) \\le \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} (2 + (\\pi-2)\\epsilon) = 2$$\nCombining our two results, $d_M(p,q) \\ge 2$ and $d_M(p,q) \\le 2$, we are forced to conclude that the Riemannian distance is precisely $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3051759"}, {"introduction": "Once we are assured that minimizing geodesics exist, a natural next question arises: for how long does a geodesic remain the unique shortest path between its endpoints?

The second term is zero.\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(a^{2}\\dot{\\theta}) - 0 = 0 \\implies a^{2}\\ddot{\\theta} = 0 \\implies \\ddot{\\theta} = 0\n$$\n\nFor the $z$ coordinate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{z}} = \\dot{z}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for $z$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{z}) - 0 = 0 \\implies \\ddot{z} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating these second-order ordinary differential equations twice yields the general form of the geodesics:\n$$\n\\theta(t) = v^{\\theta}t + c^{\\theta}\n$$\n$$\nz(t) = v^{z}t + c^{z}\n$$\nwhere $v^{\\theta}, c^{\\theta}, v^{z}, c^{z}$ are constants of integration.\n\nWe require the geodesics to pass through the point $x_{0}=(\\theta_{0},z_{0})$ at $t=0$. Substituting these initial conditions:\n$$\n\\theta(0) = v^{\\theta}(0) + c^{\\theta} = \\theta_{0} \\implies c^{\\theta} = \\theta_{0}\n$$\n$$\nz(0) = v^{z}(0) + c^{z} = z_{0} \\implies c^{z} = z_{0}\n$$\nThe initial velocity vector at $t=0$ is $\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = (\\dot{\\theta}(0), \\dot{z}(0)) = (v^{\\theta}, v^{z})$. Thus, the geodesic starting at $x_0$ with initial velocity $(v^{\\theta}, v^{z})$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = (\\theta_{0} + v^{\\theta}t, z_{0} + v^{z}t)\n$$\nThese curves are helices on the cylinder (or circles if $v^z=0$, or straight lines if $v^\\theta=0$).\n\nIf a geodesic has a nonzero angular velocity, this means $v^{\\theta} \\neq 0$. The angular coordinate is $\\theta(t) = \\theta_{0} + v^{\\theta}t$. As the parameter $t$ increases, the value of $\\theta(t)$ changes linearly without bound. Since the coordinate $\\theta$ on $S^{1}$ is periodic with period $2\\pi$, the projection of the geodesic onto $S^{1}$ continuously wraps around the circle.\n\n2) **Riemannian Distance**\n\nThe length of a differentiable curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\theta(t), z(t))$ for $t \\in [t_{0}, t_{1}]$ is given by the integral of its speed:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\sqrt{g_{a}(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} \\, dt = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\sqrt{a^{2}\\dot{\\theta}(t)^{2} + \\dot{z}(t)^{2}} \\, dt\n$$\nThe Riemannian distance $d(P_0, P_1)$ between two points $P_0=(\\theta_0, z_0)$ and $P_1=(\\theta_1, z_1)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting them. In a complete Riemannian manifold, this infimum is realized by the length of a minimizing geodesic.\n\nA geodesic connecting $P_0$ and $P_1$ is a straight line in the $(\\theta, z)$ coordinate system, but the $\\theta$ coordinate is periodic. A geodesic from $(\\theta_0, z_0)$ to $(\\theta_1, z_1)$ can wrap around the circle $k$ times, for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In the unwrapped plane, this corresponds to a straight line from $(\\theta_0, z_0)$ to $(\\theta_1 + 2\\pi k, z_1)$.\nLet the geodesic be parameterized by $t \\in [0, 1]$. Then $\\gamma(t) = (\\theta(t), z(t))$ with $\\gamma(0)=P_0$ and $\\gamma(1)=P_1$. The form of the geodesic is $\\theta(t) = (\\Delta\\theta + 2\\pi k)t + \\theta_0$ and $z(t) = \\Delta z \\cdot t + z_0$, where $\\Delta z = z_1 - z_0$ and $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_1 - \\theta_0$.\nThe length of such a geodesic is:\n$$\nL_{k} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{a^{2}(\\Delta\\theta + 2\\pi k)^{2} + (\\Delta z)^{2}} \\, dt = \\sqrt{a^{2}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)^{2} + (z_1 - z_0)^{2}}\n$$\nThe distance is the minimum of these lengths over all possible integer wrappings $k$:\n$$\nd(P_0, P_1) = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} L_{k} = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sqrt{a^{2}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)^{2} + (z_1 - z_0)^{2}}\n$$\nTo minimize this expression, we must minimize its square. The term $(z_1 - z_0)^2$ is constant with respect to $k$. We need to minimize $(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)^2$, which is equivalent to minimizing $|\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k|$. This value represents the shortest angular separation between the angles $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$. Let this minimal angular displacement be denoted by $\\Delta\\theta_{\\min}$.\nThus, the Riemannian distance is:\n$$\nd((\\theta_{0},z_{0}), (\\theta_{1},z_{1})) = \\sqrt{a^{2}(\\Delta\\theta_{\\min})^{2} + (z_{1}-z_{0})^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\theta_{\\min} = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k|$.\n\n3) **Cut Locus and Minimizing Properties**\n\nThe exponential map at $x_{0}=(\\theta_{0}, z_{0})$ is $\\exp_{x_{0}}: T_{x_{0}}M \\to M$. It maps a vector $v = (v^{\\theta}, v^{z}) \\in T_{x_{0}}M$ to the point $\\gamma_{v}(1)$, where $\\gamma_{v}$ is the geodesic with $\\gamma_{v}(0)=x_{0}$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_{v}(0)=v$. From part 1), $\\gamma_{v}(t) = (\\theta_{0} + v^{\\theta}t, z_{0} + v^{z}t)$, so:\n$$\n\\exp_{x_{0}}(v) = (\\theta_{0} + v^{\\theta}, z_{0} + v^{z}) \\pmod{2\\pi \\text{ in first component}}\n$$\nThe cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)$ is the set of points $y \\in M$ for which there exist at least two distinct minimizing geodesics from $x_0$ to $y$. A geodesic from $x_0$ ceases to be minimizing when it reaches a point on the cut locus.\n\nA point $(\\theta_1, z_1)$ has two minimizing geodesics from $(\\theta_0, z_0)$ if there are two different integers, say $k_1$ and $k_2$, that yield the same minimal length in the distance formula.\n$$\na^{2}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_1)^{2} + (z_1 - z_0)^{2} = a^{2}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_2)^{2} + (z_1 - z_0)^{2}\n$$\nThis implies $|\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_1| = |\\theta_1 - \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k_2|$.\nLet $\\delta\\theta = \\theta_1 - \\theta_0$. We need $|\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi k_1| = |\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi k_2|$ for $k_1 \\neq k_2$. Let $k_1=k$ and $k_2=j$. This means $\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi k = -(\\delta\\theta + 2\\pi j)$, so $2\\delta\\theta = -2\\pi(k+j)$, which implies $\\delta\\theta = -\\pi(k+j)$. The minimal non-zero magnitude for $\\delta\\theta$ occurs when $k+j = \\pm 1$, giving $\\delta\\theta = \\mp \\pi$.\nThis means the minimal angular displacement $\\Delta\\theta_{\\min}$ must be $\\pi$. This occurs when two geodesics, wrapping in opposite directions, have the same length. For example, angular displacements of $\\pi$ and $-\\pi$ have the same magnitude.\n\nThe cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)$ is therefore the set of points $(\\theta_1, z_1)$ such that the minimal angular separation from $\\theta_0$ is $\\pi$. This means $\\theta_1 = \\theta_0 + \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cut}(x_{0}) = \\{ (\\theta, z) \\in S^{1}\\times \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\theta = \\theta_0 + \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi} \\}\n$$\nThis is the line antipodal to $x_{0}$'s generator on the cylinder.\n\nA geodesic from $x_0$ is uniquely minimizing as long as the angular displacement is less than $\\pi$. At an angular displacement of $\\pi$, there are two minimizing geodesics. For any angular displacement greater than $\\pi$, the geodesic is no longer minimizing.\n\n4) **Injectivity Radius**\n\nThe injectivity radius at $x_0$, denoted $\\mathrm{inj}(x_0)$, is the distance from $x_0$ to its cut locus.\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = d(x_0, \\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)) = \\inf_{y \\in \\mathrm{Cut}(x_0)} d(x_0, y)\n$$\nLet $x_0 = (\\theta_0, z_0)$. A point $y$ in the cut locus has coordinates $(\\theta_0+\\pi, z)$ for some $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We compute the distance between $x_0$ and $y$ using the formula from part 2:\nThe vertical displacement is $z - z_0$. The minimal angular displacement is $(\\theta_0+\\pi) - \\theta_0 = \\pi$.\n$$\nd(x_0, y) = d((\\theta_0, z_0), (\\theta_0+\\pi, z)) = \\sqrt{a^{2}\\pi^{2} + (z-z_0)^2}\n$$\nTo find the injectivity radius, we take the infimum of this distance over all points in the cut locus, which means over all $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = \\inf_{z \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\sqrt{a^{2}\\pi^{2} + (z-z_0)^2}\n$$\nThe expression under the square root is minimized when $(z-z_0)^2$ is minimized. The minimum value of $(z-z_0)^2$ is $0$, which occurs at $z=z_0$.\nTherefore, the injectivity radius is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = \\sqrt{a^{2}\\pi^{2} + 0} = \\sqrt{(a\\pi)^2}\n$$\nSince $a>0$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(x_0) = a\\pi\n$$\nThis value is independent of the point $x_0$, as expected for a homogeneous space like the cylinder.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in Riemannian geometry, and provides all necessary information to derive a solution.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$.\n\nLet $S^{2}_{R}$ be the sphere of radius $R>0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ centered at the origin. Let $p \\in S^{2}_{R}$ be an arbitrary point. Due to the symmetry of the sphere, the injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ is independent of the choice of $p$. We can place $p$ at the North Pole, with Cartesian coordinates $(0, 0, R)$, without loss of generality. The tangent space $T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$ at this point is the plane $z=R$ in the ambient space, which we can identify with $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ via projection.\n\nThe exponential map $\\exp_{p}: T_{p}S^{2}_{R} \\to S^{2}_{R}$ sends a tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$ to a point on the sphere. This point is found by traversing a distance equal to the norm $\\|v\\|$ along the unique geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v$. On $S^{2}_{R}$, the geodesics are the great circles. The geodesics starting at the North Pole $p$ are precisely the meridians of the sphere.\n\nAll meridians originating from the North Pole $p$ converge at a single point: the South Pole, which is the point antipodal to $p$, denoted by $p_{a}$. The coordinates of $p_{a}$ are $(0, 0, -R)$. The intrinsic distance from $p$ to $p_{a}$ along any meridian is half the circumference of a great circle. The circumference of a great circle of radius $R$ is $2\\pi R$, so the distance $d(p, p_{a}) = \\pi R$.\n\nThis means that any tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$ with norm $\\|v\\| = \\pi R$ will be mapped to the same point $p_a$ by the exponential map, i.e., $\\exp_{p}(v) = p_{a}$. The set of all such vectors in $T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$ forms a circle of radius $\\pi R$. Since multiple distinct vectors are mapped to the same point, the exponential map is not injective on any open ball $B(0,r) \\subset T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$ if the ball contains this circle, which is true for any $r > \\pi R$. Consequently, $\\exp_{p}$ cannot be a diffeomorphism for $r > \\pi R$.\n\nNow, let's consider the open ball $B(0, \\pi R)$. For any vector $v$ in this ball, $\\|v\\| < \\pi R$. The point $\\exp_{p}(v)$ is at a distance $\\|v\\|$ from $p$. The image of $B(0, \\pi R)$ under $\\exp_{p}$ is the set of all points on the sphere whose distance from $p$ is less than $\\pi R$. This is the entire sphere except for the antipodal point $p_{a}$, i.e., $S^{2}_{R} \\setminus \\{p_{a}\\}$. For any two distinct points in this image, there is a unique minimizing geodesic connecting them, which implies that $\\exp_p$ is injective on $B(0, \\pi R)$.\n\nAdditionally, on a sphere, the first conjugate point to $p$ along any geodesic occurs at the antipodal point $p_{a}$, at a distance of $\\pi R$. This means that the differential of the exponential map, $d(\\exp_{p})_{v}$, is non-singular for all $v$ with $\\|v\\| < \\pi R$. Thus, $\\exp_{p}$ is a local diffeomorphism on $B(0, \\pi R)$.\n\nSince $\\exp_{p}$ is both injective and a local diffeomorphism on $B(0, \\pi R)$, it is a diffeomorphism from $B(0, \\pi R)$ onto its image. The injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ is defined as the supremum of all radii $r$ for which $\\exp_{p}$ is a diffeomorphism on $B(0,r)$. Based on our analysis, this supremum is $\\pi R$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\pi R$.\n\nPart 2: Multiple minimizing geodesics in $B(p,r)$ for $r=\\operatorname{inj}(p)+\\varepsilon$.\n\nWe have determined that $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\pi R$. We are now asked to consider the geodesic ball $B(p,r)$ for $r = \\pi R + \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon > 0$. The geodesic ball is defined as $B(p,r) = \\{q \\in S^{2}_{R} \\mid d(p,q) < r\\}$.\n\nThe maximum possible intrinsic distance between any two points on the sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ is the distance between antipodal points, which is $\\pi R$. Thus, for any point $q \\in S^{2}_{R}$, its distance from $p$ satisfies $d(p,q) \\le \\pi R$.\nGiven $r = \\pi R + \\varepsilon$, it is clear that $d(p,q) < r$ for all $q \\in S^{2}_{R}$. Therefore, the geodesic ball $B(p,r)$ is the entire sphere, $B(p,r) = S^{2}_{R}$.\n\nThe problem now reduces to explaining why the sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ contains a pair of points connected by more than one minimizing geodesic and exhibiting such a pair. On a sphere, a pair of points is connected by more than one minimizing geodesic if and only if they are antipodal.\n\nLet's exhibit such a pair explicitly. We use a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the center of the sphere. Let us choose the point $q$ with coordinates $(R, 0, 0)$. Its antipodal point is $q_{a}$ with coordinates $(-R, 0, 0)$. Both $q$ and $q_{a}$ lie on the sphere $S^{2}_{R}$, and therefore are within the geodesic ball $B(p,r)$.\n\nThe geodesics connecting $q$ and $q_{a}$ are the semi-circles of great circles that pass through both points. A great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing through the origin. For a plane to contain both $(R, 0, 0)$ and $(-R, 0, 0)$, it must contain the $x$-axis. The family of such planes is given by the equation $c_{1}y + c_{2}z = 0$ where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are not both zero. This family can be parametrized by a single angle. Each such plane intersects the sphere to form a great circle. Each great circle is divided by $q$ and $q_{a}$ into two semi-circles. Each of these semi-circles is a geodesic path between $q$ and $q_{a}$. The length of each such path is half the circumference of the great circle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi R) = \\pi R$.\n\nThe intrinsic distance between $q$ and $q_{a}$ is $d(q,q_{a})=\\pi R$. Since any path connecting these points must have a length of at least $\\pi R$, all these geodesic semi-circles are minimizing geodesics. This constitutes an infinite family of minimizing geodesics between the points $q$ and $q_{a}$.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the common length $L(R)$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the common length, denoted $L(R)$, of the minimizing geodesics found in Part 2. These geodesics connect an antipodal pair of points $(q, q_{a})$.\nAs stated in the problem, the intrinsic distance between two points on the sphere is given by $R$ times the central angle $\\theta$ (in radians) between their position vectors. For a pair of antipodal points, their position vectors are opposites, so the angle between them is $\\theta = \\pi$.\nThe distance between $q$ and $q_{a}$ is therefore $d(q, q_{a}) = R\\pi$.\nBy definition, the length of a minimizing geodesic between two points is equal to the intrinsic distance between them.\nThe common length of all the minimizing geodesics connecting $q$ and $q_{a}$ is thus $\\pi R$.\nTherefore, $L(R) = \\pi R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi R}$$", "id": "3051785"}]}
