The dimension of $\\mathcal{V}_q$ is $n-m$ and the dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_q$ is $m$. By definition of a Riemannian submersion, the restriction of the differential, $d\\pi_q|_{\\mathcal{H}_q} : \\mathcal{H}_q \\to T_{\\pi(q)} B$, is a linear isometry.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of local orthonormal frames adapted to the submersion and the computation of the matrix of the differential with respect to these frames. Let $p \\in M$ be a fixed point.\n\nFirst, we construct the required frames. Since $\\pi$ is a submersion, the distributions of vertical and horizontal spaces, $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{H}$, are smooth vector subbundles of the tangent bundle $TM$.\n1.  On a neighborhood $U \\subset M$ of $p$, we can construct a local $g$-orthonormal frame $\\{E_1, \\dots, E_m, V_1, \\dots, V_{n-m}\\}$ such that for each $q \\in U$:\n    *   The set $\\{E_1(q), \\dots, E_m(q)\\}$ is a $g$-orthonormal basis for the horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}_q$.\n    *   The set $\\{V_1(q), \\dots, V_{n-m}(q)\\}$ is a $g$-orthonormal basis for the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_q$.\n    This is possible because the distributions are smooth. One can, for example, take any smooth local frame for $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ and apply the Gram-Schmidt process.\n\n2.  Let $W = \\pi(U)$, which is an open neighborhood of $\\pi(p)$ in $B$. We need to construct a local $h$-orthonormal frame $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_m\\}$ for the tangent bundle $TB$ over $W$. A natural construction, which simplifies the problem, is to define this frame using the horizontal frame on $M$. For each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$, we define the vector field $e_j$ on $W$ by pushing forward the horizontal vector field $E_j$. Since a point $b \\in W$ may have multiple preimages in $U$, we must be careful. However, we can define the frame $\\{e_j\\}$ at a point $b = \\pi(q)$ for some $q \\in U$ by setting $e_j(b) = d\\pi_q(E_j(q))$. To ensure this is well-defined as a frame on $W$, one can pick a local section $\\sigma: W \\to U$ (which exists since $\\pi$ is a submersion) and define $e_j(b) = d\\pi_{\\sigma(b)}(E_j(\\sigma(b)))$.\n    For our purpose, it is sufficient to define the basis $\\{e_1(\\pi(q)), \\dots, e_m(\\pi(q))\\}$ at the point $\\pi(q)$ by the relation:\n    $$e_j(\\pi(q)) := d\\pi_q(E_j(q)) \\quad \\text{for } j = 1, \\dots, m$$\n    We must verify that this construction yields an $h$-orthonormal frame for $T_{\\pi(q)}B$. The map $d\\pi_q|_{\\mathcal{H}_q}$ is an isometry, so it preserves inner products. Let's compute the inner product of two such vectors in $(T_{\\pi(q)}B, h_{\\pi(q)})$:\n    $$h_{\\pi(q)}(e_i(\\pi(q)), e_j(\\pi(q))) = h_{\\pi(q)}(d\\pi_q(E_i(q)), d\\pi_q(E_j(q)))$$\n    Because $d\\pi_q|_{\\mathcal{H}_q}$ is an isometry and $E_i(q), E_j(q) \\in \\mathcal{H}_q$:\n    $$h_{\\pi(q)}(d\\pi_q(E_i(q)), d\\pi_q(E_j(q))) = g_q(E_i(q), E_j(q))$$\n    By construction, $\\{E_1(q), \\dots, E_m(q)\\}$ is a $g$-orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_q$, so $g_q(E_i(q), E_j(q)) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Thus,\n    $$h_{\\pi(q)}(e_i(\\pi(q)), e_j(\\pi(q))) = \\delta_{ij}$$\n    This shows that $\\{e_1(\\pi(q)), \\dots, e_m(\\pi(q))\\}$ is an orthonormal set of $m$ vectors in the $m$-dimensional space $T_{\\pi(q)}B$.

By construction, $V_a(q)$ is in the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_q$. The vertical space is defined as the kernel of the differential: $\\mathcal{V}_q = \\ker(d\\pi_q)$. Therefore, for any $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-m\\}$:\n$$ d\\pi_q(V_a(q)) = 0_{T_{\\pi(q)}B} $$\nwhere $0_{T_{\\pi(q)}B}$ is the zero vector in $T_{\\pi(q)}B$.\nThe coordinate vector of the zero vector is the zero column vector $(0, \\dots, 0)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$.

Let $\\gamma(t) = (b(t), f(t))$ be a curve in $M$ with $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=E=(X,U)$. Then $\\pi(\\gamma(t)) = b(t)$.

Here, this means that for any two vertical vector fields $U,V$, the vector field $\\nabla_U V$ must also be vertical. A vector field is vertical if its horizontal component is zero.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on a product manifold $M=B \\times F$ has a specific structure.

Since $\\nabla_U V$ is vertical, its horizontal projection is zero, $h(\\nabla_U V)=0$.

We apply this formula to the pair $X = E_{1}$ and $Y = E_{2}$:\n$$\nK(E_{1}, E_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\|[E_{1}, E_{2}]\\|^{2}\n$$\nUsing the given Lie bracket relation $[E_{1}, E_{2}] = 2 E_{3}$, we have:\n$$\n\\|[E_{1}, E_{2}]\\|^{2} = \\|2 E_{3}\\|^{2} = 4 \\|E_{3}\\|^{2}\n$$\nSince the frame is orthonormal, $\\|E_{3}\\| = 1$, which implies $\\|E_{3}\\|^{2} = 1$. Substituting this, we find:\n$$\n\\|[E_{1}, E_{2}]\\|^{2} = 4(1) = 4\n$$\nTherefore, the sectional curvature of the horizontal plane is:\n$$\nK(E_{1}, E_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} (4) = 1\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the problem statement that $(S^{3}, g)$ has constant sectional curvature $1$.\n\nThe third task is to deduce the Gaussian curvature of the base space $(S^{2}, g_{B})$. Since $S^{2}$ is a $2$-dimensional manifold, its Gaussian curvature is its sectional curvature. Let $\\bar{K}$ denote the sectional curvature of the base manifold $(S^{2}, g_{B})$. One of O'Neill's fundamental formulas for Riemannian submersions relates the sectional curvature of the base space to that of the total space. For a plane in the base space $T_{\\pi(p)}S^{2}$ spanned by the projections $X_{*}, Y_{*}$ of two orthonormal horizontal vectors $X, Y$ at a point $p \\in S^{3}$, the formula is:\n$$\n\\bar{K}(X_{*}, Y_{*}) = K(X, Y) + 3 \\|A_{X} Y\\|^{2}\n$$\nWe choose our orthonormal horizontal vectors to be $X=E_{1}$ and $Y=E_{2}$. Their projections under the differential $d\\pi$ form an orthonormal basis for the tangent space of $S^{2}$ at the corresponding point. The Gaussian curvature of $(S^{2}, g_{B})$ is thus given by $\\bar{K}(d\\pi(E_{1}), d\\pi(E_{2}))$. Applying the formula, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{K} = K(E_{1}, E_{2}) + 3 \\|A_{E_{1}} E_{2}\\|^{2}\n$$\nFrom the previous tasks, we have already computed the necessary quantities:\n- The sectional curvature of the horizontal plane in $S^{3}$ is $K(E_{1}, E_{2}) = 1$.\n- The norm of the O'Neill tensor component is $\\|A_{E_{1}} E_{2}\\| = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into O'Neill's formula gives:\n$$\n\\bar{K} = 1 + 3(1)^{2} = 1 + 3 = 4\n$$\nDue to the symmetries of the Hopf fibration (as a principal bundle over a symmetric space), the Gaussian curvature of the base space $(S^{2}, g_{B})$ is constant. Thus, the Gaussian curvature of $(S^{2}, g_{B})$ is $4$. This corresponds to a sphere of radius $r = 1/\\sqrt{4} = 1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3064139"}]}
