I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $(M^n, g)$ be a complete, connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \\geq 2$ with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) \\geq (n-1)k$ for some constant $k > 0$ and for all unit tangent vectors $v$.\n\nLet $p$ and $q$ be any two points in $M$. Since $M$ is complete, there exists a minimizing geodesic $\\gamma: [0, L] \\to M$ connecting $p$ and $q$, parametrized by arc-length. The length of this geodesic is $L = d(p, q)$, the distance between $p$ and $q$. Let $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ denote the tangent vector field along $\\gamma$, which is of unit length, i.e., $|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)| = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, L]$.\n\nThe second variation of the length functional along a geodesic for a variation with variation field $J(t)$ is given by the index form:\n$$\nI(J, J) = \\int_0^L \\left( |\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t)|^2 - \\langle R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t), J(t) \\rangle \\right) dt\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.

Let us construct a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{e_1(t), \\dots, e_{n-1}(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma(t)$ such that each $e_i(t)$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. This is done by choosing an orthonormal basis for the subspace of $T_{\\gamma(0)}M$ orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ and parallel transporting it along $\\gamma$. By definition of parallel transport, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} e_i(t) = 0$ for all $t \\in [0, L]$.\n\nWe now define a family of $n-1$ vector fields along $\\gamma$, for $i = 1, \\dots, n-1$:\n$$\nJ_i(t) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) e_i(t)\n$$\nThese vector fields satisfy the boundary conditions $J_i(0) = \\sin(0) e_i(0) = 0$ and $J_i(L) = \\sin(\\pi) e_i(L) = 0$.\n\nLet's compute the terms in the index form for each $J_i$.

We can write its components as:\n$$ J(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} j_i(t) E_i(t) $$\nSince the frame fields $E_i(t)$ are parallel transported along $\\gamma$ (i.e., $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}E_i = 0$), the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$ are straightforward:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{d j_i}{dt}(t) E_i(t) $$\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(t) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{d^2 j_i}{dt^2}(t) E_i(t) $$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Jacobi equation gives:\n$$ \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\left(\\frac{d^2 j_i}{dt^2}(t) + \\kappa j_i(t)\\right) E_i(t) = 0 $$\nSince the vectors $\\{E_i(t)\\}$ are linearly independent, each component must satisfy the scalar ODE:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 j_i}{dt^2}(t) + \\kappa j_i(t) = 0 $$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator.

To do this, we must choose the scaling factor $c$ such that $(M, \\tilde{g})$ satisfies the hypothesis $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}} \\geq (n-1) \\tilde{g}$.\nUsing the scaling relations we derived, this condition on $\\tilde{g}$ becomes a condition on $g$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_g \\geq (n-1) (c g).\n$$\nWe are given the hypothesis on $(M,g)$ that $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} \\geq (n-1) K g$. We can satisfy the required condition for the rescaled metric if $(n-1) K g \\geq (n-1) c g$, which simplifies to $K \\geq c$.\n\nWe seek the smallest function $D(K)$ such that $\\mathrm{diam}(M,g) \\leq D(K)$. Applying the normalized Myers' theorem to $(M, \\tilde{g})$ yields $\\mathrm{diam}(M, \\tilde{g}) \\leq \\pi$. Using the scaling relation for the diameter, this implies $\\sqrt{c} \\, \\mathrm{diam}(M, g) \\leq \\pi$, or\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M, g) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{c}}.\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any $c$ in the range $0 < c \\leq K$. To obtain the strongest possible upper bound on $\\mathrm{diam}(M, g)$ (i.e., the smallest value for the right-hand side), we must choose the largest possible value for $c$. The largest allowed value is $c=K$.\n\nLet us set $c=K$. The rescaled metric is $\\tilde{g} = K g$. The manifold $(M, \\tilde{g})$ inherits the properties of being complete and connected from $(M,g)$. Its Ricci curvature satisfies:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}} = \\mathrm{Ric}_g \\geq (n-1) K g = (n-1) \\tilde{g}.\n$$\nThus, $(M, \\tilde{g})$ fulfills all the hypotheses of the normalized Myers' theorem. We can therefore conclude that:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M, \\tilde{g}) \\leq \\pi.\n$$\nSubstituting the scaling relation for the diameter, $\\mathrm{diam}(M, \\tilde{g}) = \\sqrt{K} \\, \\mathrm{diam}(M, g)$, we get:\n$$\n\\sqrt{K} \\, \\mathrm{diam}(M, g) \\leq \\pi.\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{diam}(M, g)$, we obtain the inequality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M, g) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}.\n$$\nThis provides the upper bound on the diameter. To show that this is the smallest such bound, we can consider the canonical example of an $n$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n_R$ of radius $R$. It has constant sectional curvature $1/R^2$. If we set $K = 1/R^2$, its Ricci curvature is $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)K g$. The diameter of this sphere is $\\pi R = \\pi / \\sqrt{K}$. Since this value is achieved, no smaller upper bound is possible.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real-valued function $D(K)$ serving as a guaranteed upper bound for the diameter is:\n$$\nD(K) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}}$$", "id": "3060176"}]}
