Let the edges of the octagon be labeled consecutively in counter-clockwise order. The identification procedure is encoded by the symbolic word $aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}$. This notation signifies the following pairings of edges:\n1. The first edge (labeled 'a') is identified with the third edge (labeled '$a^{-1}$'), with their orientations reversed.\n2. The second edge (labeled 'b') is identified with the fourth edge (labeled '$b^{-1}$'), with their orientations reversed.\n3.

The final answer should be a single number.", "solution": "To find the Euler characteristic of the surface, we can use the formula for a polygonal complex: $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces in the resulting topological space after identification.\n\n1.  **Number of Faces (F):**\n    The surface is constructed by gluing the edges of a single polygon (the octagon). This polygon itself becomes the single 2-dimensional cell, or face, of the resulting surface. Therefore, $F = 1$.\n\n2.  **Number of Edges (E):**\n    The octagon initially has 8 edges. The identification word $aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}$ tells us how these edges are paired up. The labels are 'a', 'b', '$a^{-1}$', '$b^{-1}$', 'c', 'd', '$c^{-1}$', '$d^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'a' is identified with the edge '$a^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'b' is identified with the edge '$b^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'c' is identified with the edge '$c^{-1}$'.\n    - The edge 'd' is identified with the edge '$d^{-1}$'.\n    Since the 8 initial edges are identified in pairs, there will be $8 / 2 = 4$ distinct edges in the final surface. So, $E = 4$.\n\n3.  **Number of Vertices (V):**\n    This is the most involved part of the calculation. We need to determine how many distinct vertices remain after the gluing process. Let's label the vertices of the octagon $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8$ in a counter-clockwise direction. An edge labeled 'x' starting at vertex $v_i$ and ending at $v_{i+1}$ can be denoted as $(v_i, v_{i+1})$. The edge labeled '$x^{-1}$' would then correspond to the path $(v_{i+1}, v_i)$.\n\n    Let's trace the edges and vertices:\n    - Edge 1 ('a') runs from $v_1$ to $v_2$.\n    - Edge 2 ('b') runs from $v_2$ to $v_3$.\n    - Edge 3 ('$a^{-1}$') runs from $v_3$ to $v_4$. So, 'a' corresponds to the path from $v_4$ to $v_3$.\n    - Edge 4 ('$b^{-1}$') runs from $v_4$ to $v_5$. So, 'b' corresponds to the path from $v_5$ to $v_4$.\n    - Edge 5 ('c') runs from $v_5$ to $v_6$.\n    - Edge 6 ('d') runs from $v_6$ to $v_7$.\n    - Edge 7 ('$c^{-1}$') runs from $v_7$ to $v_8$. So, 'c' corresponds to the path from $v_8$ to $v_7$.\n    - Edge 8 ('$d^{-1}$') runs from $v_8$ to $v_1$. So, 'd' corresponds to the path from $v_1$ to $v_8$.\n\n    Now we establish equivalences between vertices based on edge identifications. Let '~' denote \"is identified with\".\n    - Identification of 'a' with '$a^{-1}$': Edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is identified with edge $(v_4, v_3)$. This implies that the start point of the first edge is identified with the start point of the second edge, and the end point with the end point. So, $v_1 \\sim v_4$ and $v_2 \\sim v_3$.\n    - Identification of 'b' with '$b^{-1}$': Edge $(v_2, v_3)$ is identified with edge $(v_5, v_4)$. This implies $v_2 \\sim v_5$ and $v_3 \\sim v_4$.\n    - Identification of 'c' with '$c^{-1}$': Edge $(v_5, v_6)$ is identified with edge $(v_8, v_7)$. This implies $v_5 \\sim v_8$ and $v_6 \\sim v_7$.\n    - Identification of 'd' with '$d^{-1}$': Edge $(v_6, v_7)$ is identified with edge $(v_1, v_8)$. This implies $v_6 \\sim v_1$ and $v_7 \\sim v_8$.\n\n    Let's trace the full equivalence class starting from $v_1$:\n    - $v_1 \\sim v_4$ (from 'a' rule).\n    - $v_4 \\sim v_3$ (from 'b' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_3$.\n    - $v_3 \\sim v_2$ (from 'a' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_2$.\n    - $v_2 \\sim v_5$ (from 'b' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_5$.\n    - $v_5 \\sim v_8$ (from 'c' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim \\dots \\sim v_5 \\sim v_8$.\n    - $v_8 \\sim v_7$ (from 'd' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim \\dots \\sim v_8 \\sim v_7$.\n    - $v_7 \\sim v_6$ (from 'c' rule). So, $v_1 \\sim \\dots \\sim v_7 \\sim v_6$.\n    - Finally, the 'd' rule also gives $v_6 \\sim v_1$, which closes the loop.\n\n    The chain of equivalences is $v_1 \\sim v_2 \\sim v_3 \\sim v_4 \\sim v_5 \\sim v_6 \\sim v_7 \\sim v_8$. This shows that all 8 vertices of the octagon are identified to a single point in the quotient space.\n    Therefore, the number of distinct vertices is $V = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$):**\n    Using the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$ with our computed values:\n    $\\chi = 1 - 4 + 1 = -2$.\n\n    The resulting surface is a connected sum of two tori, also known as a genus-2 surface, which has an Euler characteristic of $2 - 2g = 2 - 2(2) = -2$.

Provide your answer as an integer.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will first establish the effect of removing a single open disk on the Euler characteristic of a surface. Then, we will apply this result iteratively.\n\nThe Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, often calculated for a surface with a triangulation as $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces. For a closed 2-sphere, $S^2$, it is a standard result that its Euler characteristic is $\\chi(S^2) = 2$.\n\nNow, let's consider a compact surface $M$ and let $M'$ be the surface that results from removing an open disk $D$ from $M$. The original surface $M$ can be viewed as the union of the new surface $M'$ and the closure of the disk, $\\bar{D}$. That is, $M = M' \\cup \\bar{D}$. The intersection of these two sets is the boundary of the disk, which is a circle, $S^1$. So, $M' \\cap \\bar{D} = \\partial D \\cong S^1$.\n\nWe can use the additive property of the Euler characteristic, which is an application of the inclusion-exclusion principle. For any space that is a union of two subspaces $A$ and $B$, the formula is:\n$$ \\chi(A \\cup B) = \\chi(A) + \\chi(B) - \\chi(A \\cap B) $$\nApplying this to our surface decomposition, we get:\n$$ \\chi(M) = \\chi(M') + \\chi(\\bar{D}) - \\chi(\\partial D) $$\nTo proceed, we need the Euler characteristics of a closed disk and a circle.\nA closed disk $\\bar{D}$ is contractible to a single point. A point has an Euler characteristic of 1 (it can be triangulated as a single vertex, so $V=1, E=0, F=0$). Thus, $\\chi(\\bar{D}) = 1$.\nA circle $\\partial D \\cong S^1$ can be triangulated, for example, with 3 vertices and 3 edges forming a triangle. Its Euler characteristic is $\\chi(S^1) = V - E = 3 - 3 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values, $\\chi(\\bar{D})=1$ and $\\chi(\\partial D)=0$, into our additivity equation gives:\n$$ \\chi(M) = \\chi(M') + 1 - 0 $$\nRearranging this equation to find the Euler characteristic of the modified surface $M'$, we obtain a general rule:\n$$ \\chi(M') = \\chi(M) - 1 $$\nThis shows that removing one open disk from a compact surface decreases its Euler characteristic by 1.\n\nWe can now apply this rule to the problem at hand. We start with the sphere, $S^2$, and remove four disjoint disks sequentially. Let $S_k$ denote the sphere with $k$ disks removed.\n\n1.  The initial surface is the sphere, $S_0 = S^2$, with $\\chi(S_0) = 2$.\n2.  After removing the first disk, the new surface $S_1$ has an Euler characteristic of $\\chi(S_1) = \\chi(S_0) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n3.  After removing the second disk, the surface $S_2$ has an Euler characteristic of $\\chi(S_2) = \\chi(S_1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n4.  After removing the third disk, the surface $S_3$ has an Euler characteristic of $\\chi(S_3) = \\chi(S_2) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n5.  Finally, after removing the fourth disk, the resulting surface $S_4$ has an Euler characteristic of $\\chi(S_4) = \\chi(S_3) - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2$.\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic of a sphere from which four disjoint open disks have been removed is -2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "1672808"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a topological invariant like the Euler characteristic lies in its ability to impose strong constraints on any structure that lives on a surface.
