An example of such a manifold is the standard Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with its flat metric.\n\nLet $(M, g_M)$ and $(N, g_N)$ be two arbitrary Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. We can form their Riemannian product manifold, denoted as $P = M \\times N$, which is equipped with the product metric $g = g_M \\oplus g_N$. At any point $(p, q) \\in P$, the tangent space is given by the direct sum $T_{(p,q)}P \\cong T_p M \\oplus T_q N$. For any two tangent vectors $X = (X_M, X_N)$ and $Y = (Y_M, Y_N)$ at $(p,q)$, where $X_M, Y_M \\in T_p M$ and $X_N, Y_N \\in T_q N$, the product metric is defined by the inner product $g(X, Y) = g_M(X_M, Y_M) + g_N(X_N, Y_N)$.\n\nBased on the properties of $M$ and $N$, determine whether their Riemannian product $(P, g)$ is necessarily a Cartan-Hadamard manifold.

The product manifold $P$ is a Cartan-Hadamard manifold only if both $M$ and $N$ have constant zero sectional curvature everywhere.\n\nD. The product manifold $P$ is never a Cartan-Hadamard manifold unless one of the component manifolds is a single point.\n\nE. Whether $P$ is a Cartan-Hadamard manifold depends on the specific dimensions of $M$ and $N$ and cannot be determined in general.", "solution": "To determine if the product manifold $P = M \\times N$ is a Cartan-Hadamard manifold, we must check if it satisfies the four defining properties, given that $M$ and $N$ satisfy them. The four properties are: connectedness, simple connectedness, completeness, and non-positive sectional curvature.\n\n1.  **Connectedness**: This is a standard result in point-set topology. The product of two connected topological spaces is connected. Since $M$ and $N$ are connected (as part of the definition of a Cartan-Hadamard manifold), their product $P = M \\times N$ is also connected.\n\n2.  **Simple Connectedness**: This property relates to the fundamental group of the space. For product spaces, the fundamental group of the product is the direct product of the fundamental groups of the factor spaces: $\\pi_1(M \\times N) \\cong \\pi_1(M) \\times \\pi_1(N)$. By definition, Cartan-Hadamard manifolds are simply connected, which means $\\pi_1(M)$ and $\\pi_1(N)$ are both the trivial group. The product of two trivial groups is the trivial group, so $\\pi_1(M \\times N)$ is trivial. Therefore, $P = M \\times N$ is simply connected.\n\n3.  **Completeness**: A Riemannian manifold is complete if every geodesic can be extended indefinitely. For a product manifold $(M \\times N, g_M \\oplus g_N)$, a curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_M(t), \\gamma_N(t))$ is a geodesic if and only if its component curves $\\gamma_M(t)$ and $\\gamma_N(t)$ are geodesics in $M$ and $N$, respectively. Since $M$ and $N$ are complete manifolds, any geodesic in them can be defined for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Consequently, any geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ in $P$ can also be extended for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which means $P$ is a complete Riemannian manifold.\n\n4.  **Non-positive Sectional Curvature**: This is the most involved part. We need to analyze the sectional curvature of the product manifold $P$. Let us consider an arbitrary 2-dimensional plane (a 2-plane) $\\sigma$ in the tangent space $T_{(p,q)}P$ at a point $(p,q) \\in P$. Let $\\{u, v\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for this plane $\\sigma$. Since $T_{(p,q)}P \\cong T_p M \\oplus T_q N$, we can decompose the vectors $u$ and $v$ into their components in $T_p M$ and $T_q N$:\n    $u = u_M + u_N$\n    $v = v_M + v_N$\n    where $u_M, v_M \\in T_p M$ and $u_N, v_N \\in T_q N$.\n\n    The sectional curvature $K_P(\\sigma)$ is given by $K_P(u, v) = g(R_P(u, v)v, u)$, where $R_P$ is the Riemann curvature tensor of $P$. For a product manifold, the curvature tensor acts as follows on the decomposed vectors:\n    $R_P(u, v)v = R_M(u_M, v_M)v_M + R_N(u_N, v_N)v_N$.\n    The inner product then becomes:\n    $K_P(u, v) = g(R_M(u_M, v_M)v_M + R_N(u_N, v_N)v_N, u_M + u_N)$.\n    Because the decomposition $T_P = T_M \\oplus T_N$ is orthogonal with respect to the product metric $g$, the inner product simplifies to:\n    $K_P(u, v) = g_M(R_M(u_M, v_M)v_M, u_M) + g_N(R_N(u_N, v_N)v_N, u_N)$.\n\n    Now, recall the definition of sectional curvature for a pair of vectors. The sectional curvature $K_M(\\text{span}\\{u_M, v_M\\})$ of the plane spanned by $u_M$ and $v_M$ in $M$ is given by:\n    $$K_M(u_M, v_M) = \\frac{g_M(R_M(u_M, v_M)v_M, u_M)}{g_M(u_M, u_M)g_M(v_M, v_M) - (g_M(u_M, v_M))^2} = \\frac{g_M(R_M(u_M, v_M)v_M, u_M)}{\\|u_M \\wedge v_M\\|_M^2}.$$\n    Thus, $g_M(R_M(u_M, v_M)v_M, u_M) = K_M(u_M, v_M) \\cdot \\|u_M \\wedge v_M\\|_M^2$.\n    A similar expression holds for $N$. Substituting these back into the expression for $K_P(u, v)$:\n    $$K_P(\\sigma) = K_M(\\sigma_M) \\cdot (\\text{Area}(\\sigma_M))^2 + K_N(\\sigma_N) \\cdot (\\text{Area}(\\sigma_N))^2,$$\n    where $\\sigma_M$ and $\\sigma_N$ are the 2-planes in $T_p M$ and $T_q N$ spanned by the projections $\\{u_M, v_M\\}$ and $\\{u_N, v_N\\}$, respectively, and Area denotes the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors.\n\n    Since $M$ and $N$ are Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, their sectional curvatures are non-positive by definition: $K_M(\\sigma_M) \\le 0$ and $K_N(\\sigma_N) \\le 0$ for any planes. The area terms, being squares of norms, are always non-negative: $(\\text{Area}(\\sigma_M))^2 \\ge 0$ and $(\\text{Area}(\\sigma_N))^2 \\ge 0$.\n    Therefore, $K_P(\\sigma)$ is a sum of two non-positive terms. This implies that $K_P(\\sigma) \\le 0$ for any 2-plane $\\sigma$. The sectional curvature of the product manifold $P$ is non-positive everywhere.\n\nSince all four conditions (connected, simply connected, complete, and non-positive sectional curvature) are met, the product manifold $P = M \\times N$ is indeed a Cartan-Hadamard manifold. This holds for any choice of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds $M$ and $N$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the product manifold is always a Cartan-Hadamard manifold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1668862"}, {"introduction": "The hyperbolic plane, $\\mathbb{H}^2$, is the quintessential example of a complete, simply connected manifold with constant negative curvature.
