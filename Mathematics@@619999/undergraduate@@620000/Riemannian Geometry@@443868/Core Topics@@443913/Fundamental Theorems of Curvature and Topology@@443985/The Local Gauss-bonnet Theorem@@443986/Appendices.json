They define a triangular region for a detailed geological survey. Starting from a point $P$, they travel along a great circle path (a geodesic) to a point $Q$. At $Q$, they change direction, ensuring their new path segment, also a great circle, is exactly perpendicular to the path they just traveled. They follow this new path to a point $S$. At $S$, they make one final turn, again ensuring their new great circle path is exactly perpendicular to the segment $QS$. This third path leads them directly back to their starting point $P$. The total path forms a geodesic triangle $PQS$.
