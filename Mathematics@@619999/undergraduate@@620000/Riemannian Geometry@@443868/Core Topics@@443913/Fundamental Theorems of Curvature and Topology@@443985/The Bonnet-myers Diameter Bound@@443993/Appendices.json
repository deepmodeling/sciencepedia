We are instructed to use the relationship between Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature in dimension $2$, and the Bonnet-Myers theorem.\n\nFor a $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Ricci curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, is directly proportional to the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the metric tensor $g$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric} = K g $$\nThis equality means that for any point $p \\in S^2$ and any tangent vector $v \\in T_p S^2$, the value of the Ricci tensor acting on $v$ is $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) = K(p) g(v, v)$.\n\nThe problem provides the condition that $K \\geq 4$ at all points on the sphere. Let $v$ be a unit tangent vector, meaning $g(v, v) = 1$. Then, the Ricci curvature in the direction of $v$ satisfies:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) = K g(v, v) = K \\cdot 1 = K \\geq 4 $$\nThis establishes a lower bound for the Ricci curvature of the manifold.\n\nThe problem refers to the \"standard global consequence for the diameter of a complete manifold with strictly positive lower Ricci curvature bound,\" which is the Bonnet-Myers theorem. The theorem states that if $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq (n-1)k > 0$ for all unit tangent vectors $v$ and for some constant $k > 0$, then the manifold is compact and its diameter is bounded by:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}(M) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nIn our case, the manifold is $\\left(S^{2},g\\right)$, so the dimension is $n=2$. The Ricci curvature condition from the theorem becomes $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq (2-1)k = k$.\nWe derived from the problem's givens that $\\mathrm{Ric}(v, v) \\geq 4$.

Since $k=4>0$, all conditions of the Bonnet-Myers theorem are satisfied.\n\nApplying the theorem, we obtain the upper bound for the diameter of $\\left(S^{2}, g\\right)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}\\left(S^{2}, g\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThis is the explicit upper bound for the diameter.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks us to consider a specific case: the round sphere of radius $r=\\frac{1}{2}$ with its standard metric.\nFor a standard sphere of radius $r$ in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the Gaussian curvature $K$ is constant everywhere and is given by the formula $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$.\nFor $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, the Gaussian curvature is:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4 $$\nThis sphere is a complete manifold, and its curvature $K=4$ satisfies the given condition $K \\geq 4$.\n\nNext, we compute the actual diameter of this sphere. The diameter of a sphere of radius $r$ is the greatest distance between any two of its points. This maximum distance is achieved between any pair of antipodal points. The shortest path between antipodal points is along a great circle. The length of a great circle (the circumference) is $2\\pi r$. The distance between antipodal points is half of this length.

The solution will follow the three suggested steps.\n\nFirst, we justify that the Ricci curvature of $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$ is $\\operatorname{Ric}=(n-1)g$.\nThe unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ is given to have constant sectional curvature $K_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}} = 1$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ is $n$. According to the provided fact (ii), a manifold of dimension $m$ and constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$ has a Ricci tensor given by $\\operatorname{Ric} = (m-1)\\kappa g$. Applying this to $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ with $m=n$ and $\\kappa=1$, we find its Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}} = (n-1)(1)g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}} = (n-1)g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}$.\nThe problem states that the metric $g$ on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is the unique metric for which the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{S}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is a local isometry. The map $\\pi$ is a Riemannian covering. As stated in fact (i), a Riemannian covering is a local isometry and preserves local curvature properties. Specifically, the sectional curvature at a point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ for any $2$-plane in its tangent space is identical to the sectional curvature at a corresponding point in $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ for the corresponding $2$-plane. Since $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$ has constant sectional curvature $1$, the space $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$ must also have constant sectional curvature $\\kappa_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} = 1$.\nThe dimension of $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is also $n$. Applying fact (ii) to $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$, its Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} = (n-1)\\kappa_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} g = (n-1)(1)g = (n-1)g$.\n\nSecond, we determine an upper bound for the diameter using the Bonnet-Myers theorem.\nThe Bonnet-Myers theorem states that a complete, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ whose Ricci curvature satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,X) \\ge (n-1)k g(X,X)$ for some constant $k>0$ and all tangent vectors $X$ must be compact and have a diameter bounded above by $\\operatorname{diam}(M) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$.\nThe real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is the continuous image of the compact space $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$, so it is compact. A compact Riemannian manifold is complete. From our first step, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}} = (n-1)g$. This corresponds to the inequality $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k g$ with the choice of $k=1$. This is the largest possible value for $k$ that satisfies the inequality, which will yield the tightest upper bound. Applying the Bonnet-Myers theorem with $k=1$, we conclude that the diameter of $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is bounded by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{1}} = \\pi.\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the exact diameter of $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n},g)$.\nThe diameter of a metric space is the supremum of the distance function over all pairs of points. For $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$, this is $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}) = \\sup_{[x],[y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{n}} d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y])$.\nThe points of $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ are equivalence classes $[x] = \\{x, -x\\}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n}$.\nUsing the given fact (iv), the distance on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is defined as $d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y]) = \\min\\{d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y), d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y)\\}$.\nThe geodesic distance on the unit sphere, from fact (iii), is $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y) = \\arccos(\\langle x,y\\rangle)$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the dot product in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. This distance, let's call it $\\theta$, is the angle between the vectors $x$ and $y$ and lies in the range $[0, \\pi]$.\nThe distance $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y)$ is the angle between $x$ and $-y$. Geometrically, the great circle passing through $x$ and $y$ also passes through their antipodes. The sum of the two arc lengths between $x$ and $y$ along this great circle is the circumference of the circle, which is $2\\pi$ for a unit sphere. The geodesic distance is the shorter arc. The longer arc between $x$ and $y$ is the shorter arc between $x$ and $-y$ (assuming $y$ and $-y$ are distinct). The sum of the geodesic distances $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y)$ and $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y)$ is the distance from $x$ to $-x$ along the great circle, which is $\\pi$. Thus, $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y) + d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y) = \\pi$.\nLet $\\theta = d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,y)$. Then $d_{\\mathbb{S}^{n}}(x,-y) = \\pi-\\theta$. The distance on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is $d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y]) = \\min\\{\\theta, \\pi-\\theta\\}$.\nWe want to find the maximum value of the function $f(\\theta) = \\min\\{\\theta, \\pi-\\theta\\}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. The function $\\theta$ is increasing and the function $\\pi-\\theta$ is decreasing. The minimum of these two functions is maximized when they are equal:\n$$\n\\theta = \\pi - \\theta \\implies 2\\theta = \\pi \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n$$\nAt this value, $f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\min\\{\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. For any $\\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $f(\\theta) = \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. For any $\\theta > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $f(\\theta) = \\pi-\\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThus, the maximum possible value for the distance on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This maximum is attained when the spherical distance between representative points $x$ and $y$ is $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This corresponds to $\\langle x,y \\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$, meaning the vectors are orthogonal. Such pairs of points exist for any $n \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, the exact diameter of $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n}, g)$ is the supremum of these distances, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$", "id": "3068355"}]}
