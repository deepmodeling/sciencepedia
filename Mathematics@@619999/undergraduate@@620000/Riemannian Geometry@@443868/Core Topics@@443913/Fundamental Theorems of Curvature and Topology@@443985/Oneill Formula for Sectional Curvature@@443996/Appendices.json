It provides all necessary definitions and conditions to uniquely determine the required sectional curvatures. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $(M_{1}, g_{1}) = (S^{2}(r), g_{S^{2}(r)})$ and $(M_{2}, g_{2}) = (S^{2}(R), g_{S^{2}(R)})$ be the two factor manifolds. The product manifold is $M = M_{1} \\times M_{2}$ with the product metric $g = g_{1} \\oplus g_{2}$. At any point $p=(p_{B}, p_{F}) \\in M$, the tangent space splits orthogonally as $T_{p}M = T_{p_{B}}M_{1} \\oplus T_{p_{F}}M_{2}$. Vectors in $T_{p_{B}}M_{1}$ are horizontal and vectors in $T_{p_{F}}M_{2}$ are vertical with respect to the submersion $\\pi: M \\to M_{1}$.\n\nA key property of the product metric is how the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on $M$ relates to the connections $\\nabla^{(1)}$ on $M_{1}$ and $\\nabla^{(2)}$ on $M_{2}$. For vector fields $X = (X_{1}, X_{2})$ and $Y = (Y_{1}, Y_{2})$ on $M$, where $X_{i}, Y_{i}$ are vector fields on $M_{i}$ (pulled back to $M$), the Levi-Civita connection is given by:\n$$ \\nabla_{X} Y = \\nabla_{(X_{1}, X_{2})} (Y_{1}, Y_{2}) = (\\nabla^{(1)}_{X_{1}} Y_{1}, \\nabla^{(2)}_{X_{2}} Y_{2}) $$\nThis formula can be derived from the Koszul formula for the Levi-Civita connection and the block-diagonal structure of the metric in product coordinates. A direct consequence is that the covariant derivative of a vertical field along a horizontal direction is zero, and vice-versa.\n\nFrom the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor, $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z - \\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$, we can derive its structure on the product manifold. Let $X=(X_{1},X_{2})$, $Y=(Y_{1},Y_{2})$, and $Z=(Z_{1},Z_{2})$.\nThe terms are:\n$\\nabla_{Y}Z = (\\nabla^{(1)}_{Y_{1}}Z_{1}, \\nabla^{(2)}_{Y_{2}}Z_{2})$\n$\\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z = (\\nabla^{(1)}_{X_{1}}(\\nabla^{(1)}_{Y_{1}}Z_{1}), \\nabla^{(2)}_{X_{2}}(\\nabla^{(2)}_{Y_{2}}Z_{2}))$\nThe Lie bracket is $[X,Y] = ([X_{1},Y_{1}], [X_{2},Y_{2}])$. Thus:\n$\\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z = (\\nabla^{(1)}_{[X_{1},Y_{1}]}Z_{1}, \\nabla^{(2)}_{[X_{2},Y_{2}]}Z_{2})$\nCombining these gives:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = (R^{(1)}(X_{1},Y_{1})Z_{1}, R^{(2)}(X_{2},Y_{2})Z_{2}) $$\nwhere $R^{(1)}$ and $R^{(2)}$ are the Riemann curvature tensors of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, respectively.\n\nThe sectional curvature of a $2$-plane spanned by orthonormal vectors $U$ and $V$ is given by $K(U,V) = g(R(U,V)V, U)$. We now apply this to the specified planes. The orthonormal frame at $p$ is $\\{E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}, E_{4}\\}$, where $E_{1}=(e_{1},0)$, $E_{2}=(e_{2},0)$ are horizontal, and $E_{3}=(0,f_{1})$, $E_{4}=(0,f_{2})$ are vertical. $\\{e_{1},e_{2}\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_{p_{B}}S^{2}(r)$ and $\\{f_{1},f_{2}\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_{p_{F}}S^{2}(R)$.\n\n1.  **Horizontal plane $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\operatorname{span}\\{E_{1}, E_{2}\\}$**:\n    The sectional curvature is $K_{\\mathrm{H}} = K(E_{1}, E_{2}) = g(R(E_{1}, E_{2})E_{2}, E_{1})$.\n    Using the product curvature formula with $X=E_{1}=(e_{1},0)$, $Y=E_{2}=(e_{2},0)$, and $Z=E_{2}=(e_{2},0)$:\n    $R(E_{1}, E_{2})E_{2} = (R^{(1)}(e_{1}, e_{2})e_{2}, R^{(2)}(0, 0)0) = (R^{(1)}(e_{1}, e_{2})e_{2}, 0)$.\n    Then, the inner product is:\n    $g(R(E_{1}, E_{2})E_{2}, E_{1}) = g_{1}(R^{(1)}(e_{1}, e_{2})e_{2}, e_{1}) + g_{2}(0, 0) = g_{1}(R^{(1)}(e_{1}, e_{2})e_{2}, e_{1})$.\n    This is the sectional curvature $K^{(1)}(e_{1}, e_{2})$ of the plane $\\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ in $S^{2}(r)$. Since $S^{2}(r)$ has constant sectional curvature $1/r^{2}$, we have:\n    $$ K_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{1}{r^{2}} $$\n\n2.  **Vertical plane $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{V}} = \\operatorname{span}\\{E_{3}, E_{4}\\}$**:\n    The sectional curvature is $K_{\\mathrm{V}} = K(E_{3}, E_{4}) = g(R(E_{3}, E_{4})E_{4}, E_{3})$.\n    Using the product curvature formula with $X=E_{3}=(0,f_{1})$, $Y=E_{4}=(0,f_{2})$, and $Z=E_{4}=(0,f_{2})$:\n    $R(E_{3}, E_{4})E_{4} = (R^{(1)}(0, 0)0, R^{(2)}(f_{1}, f_{2})f_{2}) = (0, R^{(2)}(f_{1}, f_{2})f_{2})$.\n    Then, the inner product is:\n    $g(R(E_{3}, E_{4})E_{4}, E_{3}) = g_{1}(0, 0) + g_{2}(R^{(2)}(f_{1}, f_{2})f_{2}, f_{1}) = g_{2}(R^{(2)}(f_{1}, f_{2})f_{2}, f_{1})$.\n    This is the sectional curvature $K^{(2)}(f_{1}, f_{2})$ of the plane $\\operatorname{span}\\{f_{1}, f_{2}\\}$ in $S^{2}(R)$. Since $S^{2}(R)$ has constant sectional curvature $1/R^{2}$, we have:\n    $$ K_{\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{1}{R^{2}} $$\n\n3.  **Mixed plane $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{M}} = \\operatorname{span}\\{E_{1}, E_{3}\\}$**:\n    The sectional curvature is $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = K(E_{1}, E_{3}) = g(R(E_{1}, E_{3})E_{3}, E_{1})$.\n    Using the product curvature formula with $X=E_{1}=(e_{1},0)$, $Y=E_{3}=(0,f_{1})$, and $Z=E_{3}=(0,f_{1})$:\n    $R(E_{1}, E_{3})E_{3} = (R^{(1)}(e_{1}, 0)0, R^{(2)}(0, f_{1})f_{1})$.\n    The Riemann tensor is linear in its arguments. Therefore, $R^{(1)}(e_{1}, 0)0 = 0$ and $R^{(2)}(0, f_{1})f_{1} = 0$.\n    So, $R(E_{1}, E_{3})E_{3} = (0,0)$.\n    The inner product is then:\n    $g(R(E_{1}, E_{3})E_{3}, E_{1}) = g((0,0), (e_{1},0)) = 0$.\n    Thus, the sectional curvature of any mixed plane is zero:\n    $$ K_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0 $$\n\nFinally, we confirm these results with respect to O'Neill's theory for Riemannian submersions. For a product submersion $\\pi: M_{1} \\times M_{2} \\to M_{1}$, the O'Neill tensors $A$ and $T$ both vanish. This is because the Lie bracket of a horizontal and a vertical vector field is zero (so $A=0$), and the covariant derivative of a vertical field by another vertical field remains vertical (so $T=0$). O'Neill's formulae then simplify to:\n-   For a horizontal plane spanned by $X, Y$: $K_{M}(X, Y) = K_{M_{1}}(\\pi_{*}X, \\pi_{*}Y)$. This gives $K_{\\mathrm{H}} = K_{S^{2}(r)} = 1/r^2$.\n-   For a vertical plane spanned by $V, W$: $K_{M}(V, W) = K_{F_p}(V, W)$, where $F_p$ is the fiber, which is isometric to $M_2$. This gives $K_{\\mathrm{V}} = K_{S^{2}(R)} = 1/R^2$.\n-   For a mixed plane spanned by a horizontal $X$ and a vertical $V$: $K_{M}(X, V) = 0$. This gives $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0$.\nOur explicit computations are in perfect agreement with these general results for product submersions.\n\nThe computed values are $K_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{1}{r^2}$, $K_{\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{1}{R^2}$, and $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0$.\nWe express this result as the required row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{r^{2}} & \\frac{1}{R^{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3060981"}, {"introduction": "Having established the baseline with product manifolds, we now introduce a \"twist\" by considering warped products.

No flaws are detected. The problem is **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Tensors $A$ and $T$\nWe identify the tangent space $T_{(p,q)}M$ with $T_pB \\oplus T_qF$. With this identification, the horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}$ corresponds to the first factor, $T B \\oplus \\{0\\}$, and the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}$ corresponds to the second, $\\{0\\} \\oplus T F$. We use basic vector fields: horizontal fields are lifts of vector fields from $B$, and vertical fields are lifts of vector fields from $F$. For a horizontal field $X$ and a vertical field $U$, we have $[X, U] = 0$.\n\nLet $\\nabla^0$ and $\\nabla^f$ be the Levi-Civita connections for $g_0$ and $g_f$, respectively. The Koszul formula for a Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of a metric $g$ is:\n$$2 g(\\nabla_X Y, Z) = X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y],Z) - g([X,Z],Y) - g([Y,Z],X)$$\n\n**Case 1: The product metric $g_0 = g_B \\oplus g_F$**\nLet $X,Y$ be horizontal fields and $U,V$ be vertical fields.\n- To compute $A^0_X Y = \\operatorname{v}(\\nabla^0_X Y)$, we test against a vertical field $V$:\n$2g_0(\\nabla^0_X Y, V) = X(g_0(Y,V)) + Y(g_0(X,V)) - V(g_0(X,Y)) + \\dots$\nSince $X,Y$ are horizontal and $V$ is vertical, $g_0(Y,V)=0$ and $g_0(X,V)=0$. Also, $g_0(X,Y) = g_B(X,Y)$ is a function pulled back from $B$, so $V(g_0(X,Y))=0$. All other terms in the Koszul formula are also $0$. Thus, $g_0(\\nabla^0_X Y, V) = 0$, implying $\\nabla^0_X Y$ is horizontal. Therefore, $A^0_X Y = \\operatorname{v}(\\nabla^0_X Y) = 0$. So $A \\equiv 0$ for $g_0$.\n- To compute $T^0_U V = \\operatorname{h}(\\nabla^0_U V)$, we test against a horizontal field $X$:\n$2g_0(\\nabla^0_U V, X) = U(g_0(V,X)) + V(g_0(U,X)) - X(g_0(U,V)) + \\dots$\n$g_0(V,X)=0$, $g_0(U,X)=0$. $g_0(U,V)=g_F(U,V)$ is a function pulled back from $F$, so $X(g_0(U,V))=0$. All other terms are also $0$. Thus, $g_0(\\nabla^0_U V, X) = 0$, implying $\\nabla^0_U V$ is vertical. Therefore, $T^0_U V = \\operatorname{h}(\\nabla^0_U V) = 0$. So $T \\equiv 0$ for $g_0$.\n\n**Case 2: The warped product metric $g_f = g_B \\oplus (f \\circ \\pi_B)^2 g_F$**\nLet $\\phi = f \\circ \\pi_B$. The metric is $g_f(X_1+U_1, X_2+U_2) = g_B(X_1, X_2) + \\phi^2 g_F(U_1, U_2)$.\n- To compute $A^f_X Y = \\operatorname{v}(\\nabla^f_X Y)$, we test against a vertical field $V$:\n$2g_f(\\nabla^f_X Y, V) = X(g_f(Y,V)) + Y(g_f(X,V)) - V(g_f(X,Y)) + \\dots$\nThe logic is identical to the $g_0$ case. $g_f(Y,V)=0, g_f(X,V)=0$. $g_f(X,Y)=g_B(X,Y)$, so $V(g_f(X,Y))=0$. All terms vanish.\n$g_f(\\nabla^f_X Y, V) = 0$, so $\\nabla^f_X Y$ is horizontal. Therefore, $A^f_X Y = \\operatorname{v}(\\nabla^f_X Y) = 0$. So $A \\equiv 0$ for $g_f$. The horizontal distribution remains integrable and totally geodesic.\n\n- To compute $T^f_U V = \\operatorname{h}(\\nabla^f_U V)$, we test against a horizontal field $X$:\n$2g_f(\\nabla^f_U V, X) = U(g_f(V,X)) + V(g_f(U,X)) - X(g_f(U,V)) + g_f([U,V],X) - g_f([U,X],V) - g_f([V,X],U)$.\nThe terms are:\n$U(g_f(V,X)) = U(0)=0$.\n$V(g_f(U,X)) = V(0)=0$.\n$[U,V]$ is a vertical field, so $g_f([U,V],X)=0$.\n$[U,X]=0$ and $[V,X]=0$.\nThe only non-vanishing term is $-X(g_f(U,V))$.\n$g_f(U,V) = \\phi^2 g_F(U,V) = (f \\circ \\pi_B)^2 g_F(U,V)$.\n$X$ is a horizontal field, so it does not change values in fiber directions, hence $X(g_F(U,V))=0$. We apply the product rule:\n$X(g_f(U,V)) = g_F(U,V) X(\\phi^2) = g_F(U,V) (2\\phi X(\\phi)) = 2 f (Xf) g_F(U,V)$.\nSo, $2g_f(\\nabla^f_U V, X) = -2f (Xf) g_F(U,V)$.\n$g_f(T^f_U V, X) = g_f(\\nabla^f_U V, X) = -f (Xf) g_F(U,V)$.\nSince $T^f_U V$ and $X$ are horizontal, $g_f(T^f_U V, X) = g_B(T^f_U V, X)$.\nAlso, $Xf = df(X) = g_B(\\operatorname{grad}^B f, X)$.\nSo, $g_B(T^f_U V, X) = -f g_F(U,V) g_B(\\operatorname{grad}^B f, X)$.\nThis holds for all horizontal fields $X$, so we can conclude:\n$T^f_U V = -f g_F(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B f$.\n\nNow, we relate this to the expressions in the options.\nRecall $g_f(U,V) = f^2 g_F(U,V)$, so $g_F(U,V) = g_f(U,V)/f^2$.\nThe gradient of $\\ln f$ on $B$ is $\\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f) = \\frac{1}{f} \\operatorname{grad}^B f$. So $\\operatorname{grad}^B f = f \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)$.\nSubstituting these into our expression for $T^f_U V$:\n$T^f_U V = -f \\left(\\frac{g_f(U,V)}{f^2}\\right) \\left(f \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)\\right) = -g_f(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)$.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For $g_{0}$, one has $A \\equiv 0$ and $T \\equiv 0$. For $g_{f}$, the horizontal distribution $\\mathcal{H}$ remains integrable and totally geodesic so that $A \\equiv 0$, while for vertical $U,V$ one has $T_{U}V = - g_{f}(U,V)\\, \\operatorname{grad}^{B}(\\ln f)$, where $\\operatorname{grad}^{B}(\\ln f)$ is the gradient on $B$ (pulled back to $M$) with respect to $g_{B}$. In particular, the fibers $\\{b\\} \\times F$ are totally umbilic with mean curvature vector $- (\\dim F)\\, \\operatorname{grad}^{B}(\\ln f)$.**\n\n- We have shown that for $g_0$, $A \\equiv 0$ and $T \\equiv 0$. This part is correct.\n- We have shown that for $g_f$, $A \\equiv 0$. This implies $\\mathcal{H}$ is integrable and its leaves (integral submanifolds) are totally geodesic. This part is correct.\n- We have derived the formula $T_U V = -g_f(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)$. This part is correct.\n- Now consider a fiber $F_b = \\{b\\} \\times F$. The second fundamental form of the fiber is given by $II(U,V) = \\operatorname{h}(\\nabla^f_U V) = T_U V$. The induced metric on the fiber is $g_{fiber} = g_f|_{T F_b} = (f(b))^2 g_F$.\nWe see that $T_U V = -g_f(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f) = - (f(b))^2 g_F(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f) = -g_{fiber}(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)|_b$.\nSince the second fundamental form $II(U,V)$ is proportional to the first fundamental form $g_{fiber}(U,V)$ via a normal vector field $H_0 = -\\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)$, the fiber is totally umbilic. This is correct.\n- The mean curvature vector $H$ is the trace of the second fundamental form: $H = \\operatorname{tr}_{g_{fiber}}(II)$. Let $\\{e_i\\}$ be a $g_{fiber}$-orthonormal basis of the tangent space of the fiber. Let $m = \\dim F$.\n$H = \\sum_{i=1}^m II(e_i, e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^m g_{fiber}(e_i, e_i) (-\\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)) = \\sum_{i=1}^m (1) (-\\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)) = -m \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)$.\nThis matches the statement. The entire statement in option A is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For $g_{f}$, both $A$ and $T$ vanish, just as for $g_{0}$, because the splitting $TM = \\mathcal{H} \\oplus \\mathcal{V}$ is still orthogonal.**\nWe have shown that for $g_f$, $A \\equiv 0$ but $T$ is generally non-zero unless $\\operatorname{grad}^B f \\equiv 0$. The claim that both vanish is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For $g_{f}$, the tensor $A$ is generally nonzero and measures the nonintegrability of $\\mathcal{H}$ introduced by the warping factor $f$, while $T$ still vanishes because the fibers are unchanged as submanifolds.**\nWe have shown that $A \\equiv 0$ for $g_f$, so the first part of the statement is false. We have also shown that $T$ is generally non-zero, so the second part of the statement is also false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For $g_{f}$, one has $T_{U}V = - g_{F}(U,V)\\, \\operatorname{grad}^{B}(\\ln f)$ for vertical $U,V$, without any factor depending on $f$.**\nThe correct formula is $T_U V = -g_f(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f) = -f^2 g_F(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B(\\ln f)$. The formula in this option is missing a factor of $f^2$. The description \"without any factor depending on $f$\" is also strange, as $\\ln f$ is present, but the formula is mathematically incorrect regardless of interpretation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For $g_{f}$, the condition $T \\equiv 0$ holds if and only if $f$ is locally constant on $B$ (equivalently, $\\operatorname{grad}^{B} f \\equiv 0$).**\nThe formula is $T_U V = -f g_F(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B f$.\n($\\Rightarrow$) If $T \\equiv 0$, then $-f g_F(U,V) \\operatorname{grad}^B f = 0$ for all vertical $U,V$. Since $f>0$ and we can choose $U,V$ such that $g_F(U,V) \\neq 0$ (assuming $\\dim F > 0$), we must have $\\operatorname{grad}^B f \\equiv 0$.
