As one moves toward larger values of $x_{n}$ (i.e., further away from the boundary plane $x_{n}=0$), the scaling factor $x_{n}^{-1}$ approaches $0$. This means that a fixed Euclidean distance, say $\\Delta x_{n} = 1$, corresponds to an increasingly smaller hyperbolic distance. For example, the hyperbolic distance from $x_{n}=100$ to $x_{n}=101$ is $\\ln(101/100) \\approx 0.01$, while the distance from $x_{n}=1000$ to $x_{n}=1001$ is $\\ln(1001/1000) \\approx 0.001$.

This means there exists a diffeomorphism $F: M \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ that preserves the metric, i.e., for any $x \\in M$ and any $u,v \\in T_xM$, we have $g_x(u,v) = \\langle dF_x(u), dF_x(v) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{std}}$.\n\nAn isometry preserves all geometric quantities derived from the metric.

Geodesics (a curve is a geodesic in $M$ if and only if its image under $F$ is a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^n$).\n\nGeodesics in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are straight line segments. Therefore, a geodesic triangle in $M$ with vertices $p,q,r$ is mapped by the isometry $F$ to a standard Euclidean triangle in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with vertices $F(p), F(q), F(r)$. Since Euclidean triangles obey the Euclidean law of cosines, and since the isometry $F$ preserves all side lengths and angles, the original geodesic triangle in $M$ must also satisfy the Euclidean law of cosines exactly.\n\nWith this understanding, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A: Flatness rigidity: If the sectional curvature vanishes identically on a complete, simply connected manifold, there exists a global isometry $F\\colon (M,g)\\to (\\mathbb{R}^n,\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_{\\mathrm{std}})$. Isometries preserve geodesics, lengths, and angles, so geodesic triangles in $M$ correspond to Euclidean triangles in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and hence satisfy the Euclidean law of cosines.**\n\nThis option provides a perfect summary of the argument detailed above.

For a manifold with sectional curvature $K \\le 0$, the theorem provides *inequalities*, not equalities. For instance, if a geodesic triangle in $M$ has side lengths $a, b, c$, and a corresponding triangle in the Euclidean plane has side lengths $a, b$ with the same included angle $\\gamma$, the third side $c'$ of the Euclidean triangle satisfies $c' \\le c$. Equality holds for all triangles if and only if the manifold is flat ($K \\equiv 0$), but the argument in the option is flawed because it claims equality for any manifold with $K \\le 0$. The condition $K \\equiv 0$ is a crucial addition to just $K \\le 0$ to get equality, contrary to the option's claim that no additional structure is needed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: Scalar-flat shortcut: It is enough that the scalar curvature is identically $0$. Then geodesic triangles satisfy the Euclidean law of cosines.**\n\nThis option incorrectly conflates sectional curvature with scalar curvature. Sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)=0$ for all $2$-planes $\\sigma$ is a very strong condition, equivalent to the Riemann curvature tensor being zero, $R\\equiv 0$. Scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor, $S = \\mathrm{tr}_g(\\mathrm{Ric})$, which is itself a trace of the Riemann tensor. The condition $S=0$ is far weaker than $K \\equiv 0$. For example, the product manifold $S^n \\times H^n$ (for $n \\ge 2$) can be scaled to have zero scalar curvature, but it is not flat and its geodesic triangles do not obey the Euclidean law of cosines. Thus, the premise that $S=0$ is sufficient is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: Parallel transport and Jacobi fields in flat manifolds: When the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes, parallel transport is path-independent. For a geodesic triangle with vertices $p,q,r$, if $u,v\\in T_pM$ are the initial velocity vectors of the two sides from $p$ to $q$ and from $p$ to $r$, then the third side’s initial velocity, transported to $T_pM$, equals $v-u$. Using the polarization identity in the single inner product space $T_pM$ then yields the Euclidean law of cosines.**\n\nThis provides an alternative, more \"infinitesimal\" justification that is also correct. The vanishing of sectional curvature ($K \\equiv 0$) is equivalent to the vanishing of the Riemann curvature tensor ($R \\equiv 0$). This, in turn, is equivalent to parallel transport being independent of the path. This allows for a canonical identification of all tangent spaces $T_xM$ with a single tangent space, say $T_pM$. Under this identification, the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_pM \\to M$ is a global isometry. Let $u = \\exp_p^{-1}(q) \\in T_pM$ and $v = \\exp_p^{-1}(r) \\in T_pM$. The sides of the triangle originating at $p$ have lengths $c=d(p,q)=||u||$ and $b=d(p,r)=||v||$. The angle at $p$ is the angle between the vectors $u$ and $v$. A key property of flat manifolds is that the geodesic connecting $q=\\exp_p(u)$ and $r=\\exp_p(v)$ corresponds to the straight line segment from $u$ to $v$ in $T_pM$. The length of this third side is therefore $a=d(q,r)=||v-u||$. The law of cosines is then just a statement about the inner product on the vector space $T_pM$:\n$$a^2 = ||v-u||^2 = \\langle v-u, v-u \\rangle = \\langle v,v \\rangle - 2\\langle u,v \\rangle + \\langle u,u \\rangle = ||v||^2 + ||u||^2 - 2||u|| \\cdot ||v|| \\cos(\\theta_p)$$\nwhich translates to $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos(\\theta_p)$. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option E: Spherical alternative: In a manifold with $K=0$, every $2$-dimensional geodesically immersed surface has strictly positive Gaussian curvature, so geodesic triangles lie on totally geodesic $2$-spheres and satisfy the spherical law of cosines rather than the Euclidean one.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. If a surface is immersed in a manifold, its intrinsic curvature (Gaussian curvature) is equal to the sectional curvature of the ambient manifold for tangent planes to the surface. Since the ambient manifold has $K \\equiv 0$, any such surface must have Gaussian curvature identically $0$, not strictly positive. The option incorrectly describes a manifold of constant positive curvature (like a sphere), not a flat manifold. Consequently, the conclusion about the spherical law of cosines is also false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3057309"}]}
