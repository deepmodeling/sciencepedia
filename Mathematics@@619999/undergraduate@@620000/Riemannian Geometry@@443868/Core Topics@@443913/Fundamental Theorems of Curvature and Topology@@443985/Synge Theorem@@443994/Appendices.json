For a geodesic $\\gamma: [a, b] \\to M$, the index form is a symmetric bilinear form on the space of piecewise smooth vector fields along $\\gamma$ that vanish at the endpoints. It is defined as the second variation of the energy functional. For two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ along $\\gamma$, the index form is given by the formula:\n$$\nI(X, Y) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\left( \\langle D_t X, D_t Y \\rangle - \\langle R(X, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, Y \\rangle \\right) dt\n$$\nwhere $D_t$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. In this problem, the curve is the closed geodesic $\\gamma: [0, 2\\pi] \\to S^n$, and the vector field is $V(t)$. The periodicity condition $V(0) = V(2\\pi)$ ensures that we are considering a variation of a closed curve, and the boundary terms in the second variation formula vanish.\n\nWe are asked to compute $I(V,V)$, which is given by:\n$$\nI(V, V) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left( \\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle - \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\right) dt\n$$\nLet's analyze the terms in the integrand using the given information.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the vector field $V(t)$ is parallel along $\\gamma$. By definition, this means that its covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is zero:\n$$\nD_t V(t) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the index form expression, the first term in the integrand vanishes:\n$$\n\\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle = |D_t V|^2 = 0\n$$\nThe index form simplifies to:\n$$\nI(V, V) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left( 0 - \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\right) dt = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle dt\n$$\nNext, we must evaluate the curvature term $\\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle$.

The geodesic $\\gamma$ is parametrized by arc length, so it is a unit-speed curve: $|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)| = 1$. This implies $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = |\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n2.  The vector field $V(t)$ is everywhere orthogonal to the velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$: $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these two results into the expression for the action of the curvature tensor:\n$$\nR(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\left( 1 \\cdot V(t) - 0 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\right) = V(t)\n$$\nNow we can evaluate the full integrand term:\n$$\n\\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle = \\langle V(t), V(t) \\rangle = |V(t)|^2\n$$\nThe problem states that the norm of $V(t)$ is a positive constant, $|V(t)| \\equiv \\alpha$ with $\\alpha > 0$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle = \\alpha^2\n$$\nWe can now substitute this constant value back into the integral for the index form:\n$$\nI(V, V) = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\alpha^2 dt\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is a constant, we can pull $\\alpha^2$ out of the integral:\n$$\nI(V, V) = -\\alpha^2 \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 1 \\, dt = -\\alpha^2 [t]_{0}^{2\\pi} = -\\alpha^2 (2\\pi - 0) = -2\\pi\\alpha^2\n$$\nThe computed value of the index form is $I(V,V) = -2\\pi\\alpha^2$.\n\nThe problem also requires verification that this expression is strictly negative for $\\alpha > 0$. The constant $\\pi$ is strictly positive. If $\\alpha > 0$, then $\\alpha^2$ is also strictly positive. The product of three strictly positive numbers $2$, $\\pi$, and $\\alpha^2$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the final expression $-2\\pi\\alpha^2$ is strictly negative, as required. This confirms that the variation defined by the field $V$ decreases the energy (and thus length, for a unit-speed geodesic) of the curve to second order, indicating that the closed geodesic is unstable.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2\\pi\\alpha^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3067237"}, {"introduction": "The power of a mathematical theorem is often best understood by examining its boundaries.

This proposes a limiting argument: approximate the flat metric by metrics with $\\sec>0$ and pass Synge’s conclusion to the limit. There are two failures. First, for $n\\ge 2$, $T^n$ does not admit a metric with $\\sec>0$; for $n=2$ this follows from the Gauss–Bonnet theorem since $\\chi(T^2)=0$, and in higher dimensions $\\sec>0$ would force positive Ricci curvature and hence a finite fundamental group by the Bonnet–Myers theorem, contradicting $\\pi_1(T^n)\\cong\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Second, even in abstract settings, topological conclusions of Synge’s theorem do not pass to a limit of metrics without uniform positivity; strict positivity is essential. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This incorrectly weakens the hypothesis of Synge’s theorem to nonnegative sectional curvature. The theorem does not hold under $\\sec\\ge 0$; indeed, even-dimensional flat tori are counterexamples to the simply connectedness conclusion under the weaker hypothesis. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This correctly articulates the role of strict positivity: if one attempted to replace $\\sec>0$ by $\\sec\\ge 0$ in the even-dimensional case, the conclusion would fail, and $T^n$ (with even $n$) provides the counterexample, being compact, orientable, with $\\sec\\equiv 0$, yet having infinite fundamental group.
