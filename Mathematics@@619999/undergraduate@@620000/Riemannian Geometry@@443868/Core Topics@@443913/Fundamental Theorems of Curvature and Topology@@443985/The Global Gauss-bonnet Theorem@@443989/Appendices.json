This can be visualized by imagining a two-dimensional universe on a flat, square sheet of spacetime with side length $L$. To avoid edge effects, this universe is topologically \"closed\" by identifying opposite sides: the left edge is seamlessly connected to the right edge, and the bottom edge is seamlessly connected to the top edge. This process forms a compact surface without boundary, topologically equivalent to a torus.\n\nFirst, determine the Euler characteristic, $\\chi$, of this surface by considering the cell complex formed by the original square.

The construction of the surface from a square provides a natural cell decomposition. The Euler characteristic for a 2D surface is given by the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces in the cell decomposition.\n\n1.  **Faces (F):** The interior of the original square becomes the single 2-dimensional cell, or face, of our surface. Thus, $F = 1$.\n\n2.  **Edges (E):** The original square has four edges. The identification rule connects the top edge to the bottom edge, so they become a single edge in the final topology. Similarly, the left edge is identified with the right edge, becoming a second, distinct edge. Therefore, the total number of unique edges on the surface is $E = 2$.\n\n3.  **Vertices (V):** The original square has four corners (vertices). The identification rule means the top-left corner is identified with the bottom-left corner (top/bottom identification) and also with the top-right corner (left/right identification). Following this logic, all four corners of the square (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are mapped to a single point on the final surface. Thus, there is only one unique vertex in the cell decomposition, so $V = 1$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic using the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$:\n$$\n\\chi = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n$$\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the torus is 0.\n\nNext, we calculate the total integral of the Gaussian curvature, $I = \\int K dA$. To do this, we employ the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For a compact, orientable surface $S$ without a boundary, the theorem states:\n$$\n\\int_S K dA = 2\\pi \\chi(S)\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the Gaussian curvature and $\\chi(S)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface $S$.\n\nThe surface described is a torus, which is a compact, orientable surface without boundary. We have already determined its Euler characteristic to be $\\chi(S) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the Gauss-Bonnet formula:\n$$\nI = \\int_S K dA = 2\\pi (0) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the total integral of the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface is 0.\n\nThis result can also be understood intuitively. The original surface was a flat square, where the Gaussian curvature $K$ is zero everywhere. The process of identifying edges to form the torus can be done without any stretching or local distortion of the metric (i.e., the surface remains \"flat\" everywhere), so its Gaussian curvature remains $K=0$ at every point. The integral of zero over any surface is zero.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(\\chi, I) = (0, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1675801"}, {"introduction": "While the torus example connects topology to an integral, we can gain deeper insight by verifying the theorem from first principles on another canonical surface, the sphere.

The metrics $g$ and $g_{0}$ are related by $g=\\exp(2f)g_{0}$. The curvature transforms as\n$$\nK=\\exp(-2f)\\left(K_{0}-\\Delta_{0}f\\right),\n$$\nand the area elements satisfy $dA=\\exp(2f)dA_{0}$. Therefore\n$$\nK\\,dA=\\left(K_{0}-\\Delta_{0}f\\right)dA_{0}.\n$$\nIntegrating over $S$ gives\n$$\nI=\\int_{S}K\\,dA=\\int_{S}K_{0}\\,dA_{0}-\\int_{S}\\Delta_{0}f\\,dA_{0}.\n$$\nOn a compact surface without boundary, $\\int_{S}\\Delta_{0}h\\,dA_{0}=0$ for any smooth function $h$, hence\n$$\nI=\\int_{S}K_{0}\\,dA_{0}.\n$$\nSince $K_{0}$ is the constant $-1$, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem yields\n$$\n\\int_{S}K_{0}\\,dA_{0}=2\\pi\\chi(S)=2\\pi(-12)=-24\\pi,\n$$\nso\n$$\nI=-24\\pi.\n$$\n\nAssume now the claim $K\\ge 0$. From $K=\\exp(-2f)(K_{0}-\\Delta_{0}f)\\ge 0$ and $\\exp(-2f)>0$ we obtain the pointwise inequality\n$$\nK_{0}-\\Delta_{0}f\\ge 0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad -\\Delta_{0}f\\ge -K_{0}=1.\n$$\nTherefore\n$$\n\\sup_{p\\in S}\\big(-\\Delta_{0}f(p)\\big)\\ge 1.\n$$\nThis is the tightest possible lower bound forced by the assumption $K\\ge 0$, so\n$$\nM=1.\n$$\n(We note that such a function $f$ cannot actually exist on $S$, since $\\int_{S}\\Delta_{0}f\\,dA_{0}=0$ while $-\\Delta_{0}f\\ge 1$ would force $\\int_{S}(-\\Delta_{0}f)\\,dA_{0}>0$, and also $K\\ge 0$ contradicts $I=-24\\pi<0$ by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.
