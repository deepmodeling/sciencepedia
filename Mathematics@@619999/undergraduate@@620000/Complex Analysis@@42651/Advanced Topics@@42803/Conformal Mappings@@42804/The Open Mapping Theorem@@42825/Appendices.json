By definition, the operator norm is given by:\n$$ \\|T\\| = \\sup_{v \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|T(v)\\|_1}{\\|v\\|_\\infty} $$\nSince $T$ is the identity operator, $T(v) = v$.

To show that the supremum is exactly 2, we need to find a vector $v$ for which the ratio equals 2.

Dividing by $\\|v\\|_1$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\max\\{|x|, |y|\\}}{|x|+|y|} \\leq 1 $$\nThis shows that the supremum is at most 1. To show that the supremum is exactly 1, we need to find a vector for which the ratio equals 1.
