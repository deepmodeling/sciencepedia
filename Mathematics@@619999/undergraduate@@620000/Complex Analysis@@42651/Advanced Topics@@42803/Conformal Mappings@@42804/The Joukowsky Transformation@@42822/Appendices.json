Consider two curves in the complex $z$-plane. The first curve, $C_1$, is a circle centered at the origin, described by the equation $|z| = \\sqrt{2}$.

They intersect at $z_{0} = 1 + i$. We are to find the acute angle of intersection between their images $C'_{1}$ and $C'_{2}$ at $w_{0} = J(z_{0})$.\n\nFirst, recall the conformality principle: if a function $f$ is analytic at a point $z_{0}$ with $f'(z_{0}) \\neq 0$, then it preserves the magnitude of angles between smooth curves intersecting at $z_{0}$. Thus, to compute the angle between $C'_{1}$ and $C'_{2}$ at $w_{0}$, it suffices to compute the angle between $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ at $z_{0}$, provided $J'(z_{0}) \\neq 0$.\n\nWe verify that $J'(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{z^{2}}\\right)$.

The circle $C_{1}$ is given by $x^{2} + y^{2} = 2$. Its gradient (normal vector) at $(x,y) = (1,1)$ is $(2x,2y) = (2,2)$, so a tangent direction vector to $C_{1}$ at $z_{0}$ is any vector perpendicular to $(1,1)$, for instance $v_{1} = (1,-1)$.\n\nThe line $C_{2}$ is $y = x$, whose tangent direction vector is $v_{2} = (1,1)$.\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ between the tangents satisfies\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{v_{1}\\cdot v_{2}}{|v_{1}|\\,|v_{2}|} = \\frac{1\\cdot 1 + (-1)\\cdot 1}{\\sqrt{1^{2}+(-1)^{2}}\\,\\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}}} = \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\sqrt{2}} = 0,\n$$\nso $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nBy conformality at $z_{0}$, the angle between $C'_{1}$ and $C'_{2}$ at $w_{0}$ is also $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.
