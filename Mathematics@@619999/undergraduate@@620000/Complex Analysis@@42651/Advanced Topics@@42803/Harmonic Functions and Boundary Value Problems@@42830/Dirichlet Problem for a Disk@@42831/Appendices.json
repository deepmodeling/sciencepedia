All its partial derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0$.\n    Plugging these into Laplace's equation gives: $0 + \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\frac{1}{r^2}(0) = 0$.

We examine the behavior at the origin. As $r \\to 0$, the term $r^{-4}$ approaches infinity. For example, along the ray $\\theta=0$, $u(r, 0) = r^{-4}$, which clearly diverges.\n    $\\lim_{r \\to 0^+} u(r, \\theta) = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\cos(4\\theta)}{r^4} = \\infty$ (for $\\cos(4\\theta) > 0$).\n    The function is not finite at the origin.\nThus, this function is harmonic for $r>0$ but is not admissible as a solution on a disk including the origin. This matches the criteria.\n\n**E. $u(r, \\theta) = 5r\\cos(\\theta) - 2r\\sin(\\theta)$**\nThis function is a linear combination of $u_1 = r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $u_2 = r\\sin(\\theta)$. The Laplace operator is linear, so if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are harmonic, their linear combination is also harmonic.\n1.  It is a known result that $r^n\\cos(n\\theta)$ and $r^n\\sin(n\\theta)$ are harmonic for any integer $n$. Here, $n=1$. So both terms are harmonic, and their sum is harmonic.\n2.  At the origin ($r=0$), the function is $u(0, \\theta) = 5(0)\\cos(\\theta) - 2(0)\\sin(\\theta) = 0$. The function is finite.\nThus, this function is a valid physical solution on the disk.\n\nBy analyzing all options, we find that only $u(r, \\theta) = r^{-4}\\cos(4\\theta)$ is harmonic for $r>0$ but singular at the origin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2097829"}, {"introduction": "Often, the solution to a Dirichlet problem can be found by direct inspection, avoiding the need for integration to find Fourier coefficients.
