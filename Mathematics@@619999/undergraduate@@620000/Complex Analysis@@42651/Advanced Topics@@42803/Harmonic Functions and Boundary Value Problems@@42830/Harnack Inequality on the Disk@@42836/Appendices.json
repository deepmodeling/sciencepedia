You will use it as a tool in a proof by contradiction to establish that a function of the form $u(z) = |z^2+c|$ cannot be harmonic if its argument $z^2+c$ has a zero within the domain. This exercise demonstrates how the inequality is central to proving the strong minimum principle for positive harmonic functions.

A complete proof that $u(z)$ is not harmonic on any open disk $D_R = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| < R\\}$ centered at the origin can be constructed. A key step in this proof uses Harnack's inequality to handle the case where the disk is large enough to contain a zero of the polynomial $p(z) = z^2+c$.\n\nHarnack's inequality states that for any non-negative function $v(w)$ that is harmonic on a closed disk $\\overline{D(w_0, r)}$, the following relation holds for any point $w$ inside the open disk $D(w_0, r)$:\n$$ v(w_0) \\frac{r - |w - w_0|}{r + |w - w_0|} \\leq v(w) \\leq v(w_0) \\frac{r + |w - w_0|}{r - |w - w_0|} $$\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $u(z)$ is harmonic on a disk $D_R$ where $R > \\sqrt{|c|}$.

Apply the inequality on the disk $D_R$ itself, with center $w_0=0$. The left-hand side of the inequality is $u(0) \\frac{R-|z_*|}{R+|z_*|}$, which is strictly positive, while the inequality states this must be less than or equal to $u(z_*)=0$.\n\nB. Let $z_*$ be a zero of $z^2+c$. Choose a point $w_0 \\neq z_*$ and a radius $r>0$ such that the disk $\\overline{D(w_0, r)}$ is contained in $D_R$ and $z_*$ is an interior point of $D(w_0, r)$. Applying the left-hand side of Harnack's inequality with $w=z_*$ results in a strictly positive value being less than or equal to $u(z_*)=0$.\n\nC. The function $u(z)$ is not harmonic because it is the modulus of an analytic function that has a zero in the domain $D_R$. Therefore, Harnack's inequality cannot be applied in the first place, and this failure to meet the premises of the theorem is the contradiction.\n\nD. The Laplacian of $u(z)$ can be calculated as $\\Delta u = 4|z|^2/|z^2+c|$, which is non-zero for $z \\neq 0$. This means $u(z)$ is not harmonic, so the initial assumption is false, directly leading to a contradiction without needing to evaluate the inequality itself.\n\nE. According to the right-hand side of Harnack's inequality, $u(z)$ must be bounded on $D_R$ by $u(w_0) \\frac{r+|w-w_0|}{r-|w-w_0|}$.

Choose $r>0$ so that $|z_{*}-w_{0}|<r$ and $\\overline{D(w_{0},r)} \\subset D_{R}$.

Hence $u$ cannot be harmonic on any such disk. This argument requires applying Harnack’s inequality on a smaller closed disk contained in $D_{R}$ with a center where $u$ is strictly positive; it does not validly apply directly on $D_{R}$ with $r=R$ as that closed disk is not contained in the open domain by the stated hypothesis.
