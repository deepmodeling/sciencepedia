We often encounter harmonic functions in physics, such as in electrostatics or, as in this hypothetical scenario, steady-state temperature distributions. The principle elegantly reduces the problem of finding the hottest or coldest point on a 2D plate to a more manageable task of inspecting only its 1D boundary. This practice allows you to combine the Maximum Principle with standard multivariable calculus techniques, like the method of Lagrange multipliers, to solve a tangible optimization problem [@problem_id:2276702].", "problem": "A thin, flat metal plate is shaped to occupy the region $D$ in the $xy$-plane defined by the inequality $x^2 + 9y^2 \\le 36$. The plate is in thermal equilibrium, and its steady-state temperature distribution at any point $(x,y)$ is described by the function $T(x,y) = x - 2y$. From the principles of heat conduction, it is known that a steady-state temperature distribution in a uniform medium with no internal heat sources or sinks corresponds to a harmonic function.\n\nDetermine the maximum temperature on the plate.", "solution": "We are given the temperature function $T(x,y)=x-2y$ on the plate occupying the region $D=\\{(x,y): x^{2}+9y^{2}\\le 36\\}$. Since $T$ is linear in $x$ and $y$, it is harmonic, and by the maximum principle for harmonic functions in a bounded domain with no internal sources or sinks, the maximum is attained on the boundary of $D$.
