This practice problem [@problem_id:2253890] asks you to analyze two functions defined by integrals and determine, based on the analyticity of their integrands, which one will be single-valued. This exercise directly applies the central idea of the Monodromy Theoremâ€”that continuation within a simply connected domain results in a well-defined, single-valued function.", "problem": "In complex analysis, the value of an integral between two points can depend on the path taken. A function $F(z) = \\int_{z_0}^z f(\\zeta) d\\zeta$ is guaranteed to be single-valued (path-independent) if the integrand $f(\\zeta)$ is analytic throughout a simply connected domain containing all possible paths. The Monodromy Theorem provides a formal basis for this, stating that if a function element can be analytically continued along any path within a simply connected domain, the result is a single-valued global analytic function.\n\nConsider two functions, $G_1(z)$ and $G_2(z)$, which are defined by integrals in the complex plane:\n- $G_1(z) = \\int_0^z (1+\\zeta) \\cos(\\zeta) d\\zeta$\n- $G_2(z) = \\int_1^z \\frac{1}{\\zeta^2 - 4} d\\zeta$\n\nFor each function, the integral is computed from a fixed starting point to a variable endpoint $z$.

Since both $\\zeta\\mapsto 1+\\zeta$ and $\\zeta\\mapsto \\cos(\\zeta)$ are entire, their product $f_{1}$ is entire. Thus the largest domain of analyticity is $D_{1}=\\mathbb{C}$, which is simply connected.
