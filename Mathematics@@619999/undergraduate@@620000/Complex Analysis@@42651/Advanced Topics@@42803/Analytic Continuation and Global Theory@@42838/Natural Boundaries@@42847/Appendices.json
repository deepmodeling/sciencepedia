By the Pólya–Carlson theorem, a power series with integer coefficients and radius of convergence $1$ is either a rational function (necessarily with poles only at roots of unity) or has the unit circle as a natural boundary.\n\nIt remains to show that $S(z)$ is not rational. If $S$ were rational, then $T(z)=S(z)/z$ would also be rational.

Thus $P_{m}$ has a finite but unbounded (in $m$) set of simple zeros on $|z|=1$, growing like a constant multiple of $2^{m}$.\n\nAt any $z$ where $P_{m}(z)=0$ and $T(z^{2^{m}})$ is finite (i.e., not a pole), the right-hand side vanishes, so the left-hand side forces $T(z)=0$. The only possible exceptions are those $z$ for which $T(z^{2^{m}})$ has a pole that could cancel the simple zero of $P_{m}$. Since a rational function has only finitely many poles, the set of such exceptional $z$ is contained in the finite set of $2^{m}$-th preimages of the poles of $T$, and therefore has cardinality at most proportional to $2^{m}$. Because the zero set of $P_{m}$ has cardinality proportional to $2^{m}$ with a larger constant factor, for sufficiently large $m$ there remain many points $z$ with $P_{m}(z)=0$ where $T(z^{2^{m}})$ is finite, forcing $T(z)=0$. Hence $T$ would have infinitely many distinct zeros. A nonzero rational function cannot have infinitely many zeros, so $T$ (and thus $S$) cannot be rational.\n\nBy Pólya–Carlson, since $S$ is not rational, the unit circle is a natural boundary for $S(z)$. Therefore $S(z)$ cannot be analytically continued to any open region strictly larger than the unit disk.
