This powerful theorem allows us to perform an analytic continuation of a function across a line segment on which it is real-valued.

It is known that for any real number $x$, the value of the function $f(x)$ is a real number. A specific measurement reveals that the function's value at the point $z=i$ is $f(i) = 2 - 3i$.

Since $f$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and satisfies $f(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ for every real $x$, we can define an analytic continuation $F$ to the lower half-plane by\n$$\nF(z)=\n\\begin{cases}\nf(z), & \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im} z>0,\\\\\n\\overline{f(\\overline{z})}, & \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im} z<0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFirst, note that the map $z\\mapsto \\overline{z}$ takes the lower half-plane to the upper half-plane. Since $f$ is analytic on the upper half-plane, the composition $z\\mapsto f(\\overline{z})$ is analytic on the lower half-plane, and complex conjugation preserves analyticity when applied to the values, so $z\\mapsto \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ is analytic on the lower half-plane.

First, $f$ is entire, hence analytic on $U$, so the analyticity condition is satisfied. Second, being entire, $f$ is continuous on $U$ and extends continuously to the real axis, so the boundary continuity condition is satisfied. Third, we evaluate the boundary values on the real axis: for $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$,\n$$\nf(x)=\\exp(i x)=\\cos(x)+i\\sin(x).\n$$\nThis is not real for general $x$, since $\\sin(x)$ is not identically zero. Therefore, the key condition that $f$ take real values on an interval of the real axis fails. Consequently, the standard formulation of the Schwarz Reflection Principle across the real line cannot be applied to extend $f$ from $U$ by reflection.\n\nThus, among the options given, the correct reason is that $f$ does not take purely real values on the real axis, which corresponds to option C.
