However, for the set $S$, this construction is not possible. Which one of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental reason for this failure, based on the necessary preconditions for applying the theorem and its related principles in complex analysis?\n\nA. The set $S$ is countable, which is a property that the Weierstrass factorization theorem cannot accommodate for constructing non-polynomial functions.\n\nB. The magnitude of every element in $S$ is exactly 1, which implies the sequence of zero magnitudes $|a_n|$ does not tend to infinity, violating a key convergence criterion for the Weierstrass product.\n\nC.

A necessary precondition is that the zero set is discrete in $\\mathbb{C}$, i.e., it has no finite accumulation points.\n\nIdentity theorem (zeros are isolated): If an analytic function on a domain has a set of zeros with a limit point inside the domain, then the function is identically zero.

Therefore, every point on the unit circle is an accumulation point of $S$, so $S$ has accumulation points in the finite complex plane and is not discrete.\n\nConsequently, no nonzero entire function can have $S$ as its zero set.

Hence the fundamental reason the construction fails is that $S$ possesses accumulation points in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nAmong the options, this is exactly statement C.
