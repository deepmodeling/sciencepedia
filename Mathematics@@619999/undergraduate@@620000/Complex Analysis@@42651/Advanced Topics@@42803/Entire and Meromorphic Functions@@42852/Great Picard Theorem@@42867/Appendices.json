A standard way to produce an essential singularity at $z_{0}$ is to consider compositions of the form $h\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-z_{0}}\\right)$ where $h$ is a non-polynomial entire function (e.g., $\\exp$ or $\\sin$), because $\\frac{1}{z-z_{0}} \\to \\infty$ as $z \\to z_{0}$ and non-polynomial entire functions have an essential singularity at $w=\\infty$.\n\nWe analyze each option with two requirements: (i) $z=2i$ is an isolated essential singularity, and (ii) the function omits exactly the value $w=5$.\n\nOption A: $f(z)=\\frac{5}{z-2i}$. This has a simple pole at $z=2i$, hence the singularity is a pole, not essential. Therefore A fails (i).\n\nOption B: $f(z)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-2i}\\right)+5$. Since $\\frac{1}{z-2i}$ has a pole at $z=2i$ and $\\sin$ is a non-polynomial entire function, $z=2i$ is an essential singularity for $f$. To check omission of $w=5$, solve $f(z)=5$:\n$$\n\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-2i}\\right)+5=5\n\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\n\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-2i}\\right)=0\n\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\n\\frac{1}{z-2i}=n\\pi,\\quad n\\in\\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\nFor $n\\neq 0$, this yields $z=2i+\\frac{1}{n\\pi}$, which are legitimate solutions accumulating at $2i$. Thus $f$ assumes the value $5$ infinitely often near $2i$, so it does not omit $5$. Therefore B fails (ii).\n\nOption C: $f(z)=\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-2i}\\right)+5$. As above, $z=2i$ is an essential singularity.

Therefore $f$ omits exactly the value $5$. By the Great Picard Theorem, in any punctured neighborhood of $2i$, $f$ takes all other complex values infinitely often with at most one exception; here the exception is indeed $5$. Thus C satisfies both (i) and (ii).\n\nOption D: $f(z)=\\exp(z-2i)+5$ is entire, hence analytic at $z=2i$; there is no singularity at $2i$. Therefore D fails (i).\n\nOption E: $f(z)=\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z+2i}\\right)+5$ has an isolated essential singularity at $z=-2i$, not at $z=2i$.

This problem presents a common conceptual hurdle: reconciling the seemingly orderly behavior of a function along a single path with the chaotic behavior implied by the Great Picard Theorem. By resolving this apparent paradox, you will clarify the crucial distinction between a function's properties on a one-dimensional curve versus its properties across a two-dimensional neighborhood.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is studying the behavior of complex functions near essential singularities. The student considers a function $f(z)$ which is analytic on a punctured disk $D_R'(z_0) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : 0 < |z-z_0| < R\\}$ for some $R > 0$, and has an essential singularity at $z_0$. By numerical investigation, the student discovers a specific smooth path $\\gamma$ within the disk that approaches $z_0$, along which the function's modulus grows without bound. That is, if the path is parameterized by $\\gamma(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1)$ such that $\\lim_{t \\to 1^-} \\gamma(t) = z_0$, then $\\lim_{t \\to 1^-} |f(\\gamma(t))| = \\infty$.\n\nThe student claims this finding contradicts the Great Picard Theorem, which states that in any punctured neighborhood of an essential singularity, the function takes on every complex value, with at most one exception, infinitely many times. The student's argument is: \"If the function is 'settling' on the value of infinity along this path, it is not exhibiting the chaotic behavior of visiting almost all other complex values. Therefore, the theorem must not hold.\"\n\nWhich one of the following statements correctly resolves the student's apparent paradox?\n\nA. The student is correct. The existence of a path along which the limit is infinity proves that $z_0$ is a pole, not an essential singularity, and Great Picard's Theorem does not apply to poles.\nB. The Great Picard Theorem is a statement about entire functions only. Since $f(z)$ has a singularity, it is not entire, and thus the theorem is irrelevant to this scenario.\nC. The student's conclusion is incorrect because the Great Picard Theorem applies to the set of values that $f(z)$ takes in a two-dimensional punctured neighborhood of $z_0$. The behavior along a single one-dimensional path does not constrain the function's behavior elsewhere in that neighborhood.\nD. The observation is only possible if the single exceptional value in the Great Picard Theorem is $\\infty$. This means the function takes on every finite complex value infinitely often, but the path $\\gamma$ shows where the function \"fails\" to be finite.\nE. The student's observation of such a path must be a numerical error. The Casorati-Weierstrass theorem implies that the limit of $f(z)$ as $z$ approaches an essential singularity cannot exist, even along a specific path.", "solution": "The correct statement that resolves the student's confusion is C. Let's analyze each option in detail.\n\nFirst, we will analyze the correct option, C.\nThe Great Picard Theorem states that for an analytic function $f(z)$ with an essential singularity at $z_0$, in any punctured neighborhood of $z_0$, the equation $f(z) = w$ has infinitely many solutions for every $w \\in \\mathbb{C}$, with at most one exceptional value for $w$. The key is that the theorem describes the range of the function over a *set* of points, specifically a two-dimensional open set (the punctured neighborhood). A path $\\gamma$ approaching $z_0$ is a one-dimensional curve. The behavior of $f(z)$ as $z$ is constrained to this single path does not dictate the function's behavior on any other path or in the neighborhood as a whole. An essential singularity is characterized by extremely complex behavior. While $f(z)$ may tend to infinity along one path, it can simultaneously tend to zero along another, and spiral towards any other complex number along yet other paths. For any punctured disk $D_r'(z_0)$ (with $r<R$), no matter how small, the image $f(D_r'(z_0))$ covers the entire complex plane, with the possible exception of one point. The existence of a path to infinity is entirely consistent with this property. For example, consider the function $f(z) = \\exp(1/z)$ which has an essential singularity at $z_0=0$. If we approach $z_0=0$ along the positive real axis, say $\\gamma_1(t) = t$ for $t \\in (0,1)$, then $\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} f(\\gamma_1(t)) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\exp(1/t) = \\infty$. However, if we approach along the negative real axis, say $\\gamma_2(t) = -t$ for $t \\in (0,1)$, then $\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} f(\\gamma_2(t)) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\exp(-1/t) = 0$. The function can take different limiting values along different paths, and this is a hallmark of an essential singularity, not a contradiction to any theorem about it. The theorem guarantees that for any $w \\ne 0$, the equation $\\exp(1/z) = w$ has infinitely many solutions in any punctured neighborhood of the origin. The fact that the function goes to $\\infty$ along one path doesn't change this. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nNow, let's analyze why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is incorrect. A function $f(z)$ has a pole at $z_0$ if and only if $\\lim_{z \\to z_0} f(z) = \\infty$. This limit must hold regardless of the path taken to approach $z_0$. The problem states that the limit is infinity *along a specific path*. The very fact that different paths can yield different limiting behaviors (or no limit at all) is what distinguishes an essential singularity from a pole. Therefore, observing a single path where the limit is infinity is not sufficient to classify the singularity as a pole.\n\nOption B is incorrect. This statement confuses the Great Picard Theorem with the Little Picard Theorem. The Little Picard Theorem states that a non-constant entire function (a function analytic on the whole complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$) takes on every complex value, with at most one exception. The Great Picard Theorem, on the other hand, is specifically a statement about the local behavior of a function near an essential singularity. It is precisely the correct theorem to consider in this context.\n\nOption D is incorrect. First, the \"exceptional value\" in the Great Picard Theorem must be a point in $\\mathbb{C}$, i.e., a finite complex number. Infinity is not a point in the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$, so it cannot be the exceptional value in the standard formulation of the theorem. Second, even if we consider functions on the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{C} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$, one cannot conclude that infinity is the exceptional value simply from the behavior along one path. As shown with the example $f(z) = \\exp(1/z)$, the function approaches $\\infty$ along the positive real axis, but its actual exceptional value is $w=0$. The limit along a path is not necessarily the exceptional value.\n\nOption E is incorrect. This option misinterprets the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem. The theorem states that the image of any punctured neighborhood of an essential singularity is dense in $\\mathbb{C}$. A consequence is that the full limit $\\lim_{z \\to z_0} f(z)$ does not exist (it's not a finite value, nor is it $\\infty$). However, this does not forbid the existence of path-dependent limits. As the example $f(z) = \\exp(1/z)$ demonstrated, the limit can exist and be well-defined when $z$ is restricted to a particular path.
