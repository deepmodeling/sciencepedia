This exercise challenges you to apply this theorem in a creative way.

You are asked to determine if a non-constant entire function can satisfy a given differential equation. This problem is a classic example of a proof by contradiction, where assuming the existence of such a function and analyzing its range via Picard's theorem—in conjunction with tools like contour integration—leads to an elegant impossibility, highlighting the deep structural constraints on entire functions [@problem_id:2251584].", "problem": "Let $S$ be the set of all entire functions $f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ that satisfy the differential equation\n$$f'(z) = 1 + [f(z)]^2$$\nfor all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.

We can approach this by first searching for constant solutions and then investigating the possibility of non-constant solutions.\n\nFirst, let's search for constant solutions. Let $f(z) = c$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$. The derivative is $f'(z) = 0$. Substituting this into the differential equation gives:\n$$0 = 1 + c^2$$\nThis equation has solutions $c^2 = -1$, which are $c = i$ and $c = -i$.\nThus, the constant functions $f_1(z) = i$ and $f_2(z) = -i$ are entire functions that satisfy the differential equation. This means the set $S$ is not empty and contains at least two functions. This immediately rules out options A.\n\nNext, we investigate if any non-constant entire solutions exist. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is a non-constant entire function $f(z)$ that satisfies the differential equation $f'(z) = 1 + [f(z)]^2$.\n\nWe can rewrite the differential equation as:\n$$\\frac{f'(z)}{1 + [f(z)]^2} = 1$$\nThis holds for all $z$ where $1 + [f(z)]^2 \\neq 0$. The values of $f(z)$ that would make the denominator zero are $i$ and $-i$.\n\nAccording to Little Picard's Theorem, a non-constant entire function can omit at most one finite complex value. This means the range of our hypothetical non-constant entire function $f(z)$ is either the entire complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$, or the complex plane minus a single point, $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{p\\}$ for some $p \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nLet's integrate both sides of the rewritten differential equation over a closed loop $\\gamma$ in the complex plane, from a starting point $z_0$ back to $z_0$.\n$$\\oint_\\gamma \\frac{f'(\\zeta)}{1 + [f(\\zeta)]^2} d\\zeta = \\oint_\\gamma 1 \\, d\\zeta$$\nThe integral on the right-hand side is zero by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, as the integrand $g(z)=1$ is an entire function.\n$$\\oint_\\gamma 1 \\, d\\zeta = 0$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the integral on the left-hand side. We can perform a change of variables $w = f(\\zeta)$, which gives $dw = f'(\\zeta)d\\zeta$. As $\\zeta$ traverses the closed loop $\\gamma$ in the $z$-plane, $w=f(\\zeta)$ traverses a corresponding closed loop, which we'll call $\\Gamma = f(\\gamma)$, in the $w$-plane. The integral becomes:\n$$\\oint_\\Gamma \\frac{1}{1 + w^2} dw$$\nThe integrand $h(w) = \\frac{1}{1+w^2} = \\frac{1}{(w-i)(w+i)}$ has simple poles at $w=i$ and $w=-i$. We can evaluate this integral using the Residue Theorem, provided the loop $\\Gamma$ encloses one or both of these poles.\n\nWe now use the property of the range of the entire function $f(z)$ established by Picard's theorem.\nCase 1: The range of $f(z)$ is $\\mathbb{C}$.\nSince the range of $f$ is the entire complex plane, we can certainly choose a closed loop $\\gamma$ in the $z$-plane such that its image $\\Gamma = f(\\gamma)$ in the $w$-plane is a simple closed curve that encloses the pole at $w=i$ but not the pole at $w=-i$. For such a loop $\\Gamma$, the Residue Theorem gives:\n$$\\oint_\\Gamma \\frac{1}{1 + w^2} dw = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}_{w=i}\\left(\\frac{1}{(w-i)(w+i)}\\right)$$\nThe residue at $w=i$ is $\\lim_{w \\to i} (w-i)\\frac{1}{(w-i)(w+i)} = \\frac{1}{i+i} = \\frac{1}{2i}$.\nSo, the integral is $2\\pi i \\cdot \\frac{1}{2i} = \\pi$.\nEquating the left-hand side and right-hand side of our integrated equation gives $\\pi = 0$, which is a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: The range of $f(z)$ is $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{p\\}$ for some point $p$.\nSubcase 2a: The omitted point $p$ is neither $i$ nor $-i$. The range of $f(z)$ contains both $i$ and $-i$. We can again choose a loop $\\gamma$ such that $\\Gamma = f(\\gamma)$ encloses $i$ but not $-i$, leading to the same contradiction $\\pi=0$.\nSubcase 2b: The omitted point is $p=i$. The range of $f(z)$ is $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{i\\}$. In this case, we cannot construct a loop $\\Gamma$ that encloses $i$. However, the range still contains the point $-i$. We can construct a simple closed loop $\\gamma$ in the $z$-plane such that its image $\\Gamma = f(\\gamma)$ encloses the pole at $w=-i$. The Residue Theorem now gives:\n$$\\oint_\\Gamma \\frac{1}{1 + w^2} dw = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}_{w=-i}\\left(\\frac{1}{(w-i)(w+i)}\\right)$$\nThe residue at $w=-i$ is $\\lim_{w \\to -i} (w+i)\\frac{1}{(w-i)(w+i)} = \\frac{1}{-i-i} = -\\frac{1}{2i}$.\nSo, the integral is $2\\pi i \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2i}\\right) = -\\pi$.\nEquating the integrals gives $-\\pi = 0$, which is again a contradiction.\nSubcase 2c: The omitted point is $p=-i$. This is symmetric to the previous case. We can find a loop enclosing $i$, leading to the contradiction $\\pi=0$.\n\nIn all possible cases, the assumption of a non-constant entire solution leads to a contradiction. Therefore, no non-constant entire functions can satisfy the differential equation.\n\nThe only solutions are the constant functions $f(z)=i$ and $f(z)=-i$. Thus, the set $S$ contains exactly two functions, both of which are constant. This corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2251584"}]}
