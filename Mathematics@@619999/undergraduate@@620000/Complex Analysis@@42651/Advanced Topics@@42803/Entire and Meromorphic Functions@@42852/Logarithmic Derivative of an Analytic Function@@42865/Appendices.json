The true utility of the logarithmic derivative is its remarkable ability to detect and classify the zeros and poles of a function. This exercise demonstrates the cornerstone of this property: the residue of the logarithmic derivative at a singularity is directly related to the nature of that point. Although the problem is framed in the context of a hypothetical \"Complex Growth Indicator\", the underlying principle you will uncover—that the residue at a zero equals its order—is a fundamental result in complex analysis [@problem_id:2252139].", "problem": "In the study of certain complex dynamical systems, the stability of trajectories is sometimes analyzed using a function's \"Complex Growth Indicator\" (CGI), which is defined as its logarithmic derivative, $\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$.
