The convergence is uniform on compact subsets of $\\mathbb{C}$. This problem can be solved by applying Hurwitz's Theorem.\n\nFirst, let's state the relevant theorem. Hurwitz's Theorem states that if $\\{f_n\\}$ is a sequence of analytic functions on a domain $D$ that converges uniformly on compact subsets of $D$ to a function $f$, and if $f$ is not identically zero, then the zeros of $f$ are related to the zeros of $f_n$. Specifically, if $z_0$ is a zero of $f$ of multiplicity $m$, then any sufficiently small disk around $z_0$ that contains no other zeros of $f$ must contain exactly $m$ zeros of $f_n$ (counted with multiplicity) for all sufficiently large $n$.\n\nIn our case, the functions are polynomials $p_n(z)$, which are analytic on the entire complex plane $D = \\mathbb{C}$. The sequence $\\{p_n(z)\\}$ converges uniformly on compact subsets to a non-zero polynomial $p(z)$. The crucial piece of information is that for every $n$, all roots (zeros) of $p_n(z)$ are real numbers.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the limit polynomial $p(z)$ has a non-real root $z_0$. Since $z_0$ is not real, its imaginary part is non-zero, i.e., $\\text{Im}(z_0) \\neq 0$. Let the multiplicity of this root be $m \\geq 1$.\n\nSince polynomials have a finite number of roots, we can always find an open disk $D(z_0, \\epsilon)$ centered at $z_0$ with a radius $\\epsilon  0$ that is small enough to satisfy two conditions:\n1. It contains no other roots of $p(z)$.\n2. It does not intersect the real axis. This is possible by choosing $\\epsilon  |\\text{Im}(z_0)|$.\n\nThe closure of this disk, $\\overline{D(z_0, \\epsilon)}$, is a compact subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. By the problem statement, $p_n(z) \\to p(z)$ uniformly on this set. We are also given that $p(z)$ is not the zero polynomial. All conditions for Hurwitz's Theorem are met.\n\nApplying Hurwitz's Theorem, for $n$ large enough, the polynomial $p_n(z)$ must have exactly $m$ roots (counting multiplicity) inside the disk $D(z_0, \\epsilon)$. However, we constructed this disk specifically so that it contains no real numbers. This leads to a contradiction:\n- From Hurwitz's Theorem, $p_n(z)$ must have a root inside $D(z_0, \\epsilon)$.\n- Any root inside $D(z_0, \\epsilon)$ must be non-real.\n- From the problem statement, all roots of $p_n(z)$ are real.\n\nThis contradiction means our initial assumption must be false. Therefore, the limit polynomial $p(z)$ cannot have any non-real roots.

The set of its roots is the empty set. Since the empty set is a subset of the real numbers, the condition that all roots are real is satisfied vacuously. Therefore, this is a possible limit. For instance, the sequence $p_n(z) = 5 + \\frac{1}{n}$ converges uniformly to $p(z)=5$ and has no roots for any $n$.\n\nTherefore, the only polynomial that could not possibly be the limit is the one with non-real roots.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2245348"}]}
