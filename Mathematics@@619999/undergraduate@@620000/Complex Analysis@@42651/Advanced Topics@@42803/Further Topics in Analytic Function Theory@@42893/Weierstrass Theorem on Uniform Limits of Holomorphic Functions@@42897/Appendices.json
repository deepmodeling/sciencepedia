While the Weierstrass theorem guarantees that the uniform limit of holomorphic functions is holomorphic, it does not guarantee that other properties are preserved.

The condition for uniform convergence is that the supremum of the absolute difference, $\\sup_{z \\in K} |g_n(z) - g(z)|$, must approach zero as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nFirst, let's understand why the initial conditions are insufficient on their own. The key issue is whether the limit function $f(z)$ can have a zero in $K$, even if each $f_n(z)$ does not. The condition that $f$ is \"not identically zero on $K$\" does not preclude $f$ from having isolated zeros in $K$. If $f$ has a zero in $K$, then $g = 1/f$ is not continuous on $K$ and cannot be the uniform limit of the continuous functions $g_n = 1/f_n$.\n\nLet's construct a counterexample to show this can happen. Let $K = [0, 1]$ (a compact subset of $\\mathbb{C}$) and let $D$ be any open set containing $K$. Consider the sequence of functions $f_n(x) = x + \\frac{1}{n}$.\n1. Each $f_n$ is holomorphic and is non-vanishing on $K=[0,1]$, since $x+1/n > 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$ and $n \\ge 1$.\n2. The sequence converges uniformly to $f(x)=x$ on $K$, because $|f_n(x) - f(x)| = |(x+1/n) - x| = 1/n$, which tends to 0 independently of $x$.\n3. The limit function $f(x)=x$ is not identically zero on $K$.\n\nAll initial conditions are met. However, the limit function $f(x)=x$ has a zero at $x=0$, which is in $K$. The reciprocal function $g(x) = 1/f(x) = 1/x$ is unbounded near $x=0$ and is not continuous on $K$. Therefore, the sequence $g_n(x) = 1/(x+1/n)$ cannot converge uniformly to $g(x)=1/x$ on $[0,1]$. This shows that the original conditions are not sufficient.\n\nNow let's examine the options to find a necessary and sufficient condition.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   A. The set $K$ must be a connected set. Our counterexample used $K=[0,1]$, which is connected. So this condition is not sufficient. It's also not necessary; uniform convergence can occur on disconnected sets.\n*   B. The limit function $f$ must be a non-zero constant function. If $f(z) = c \\neq 0$, then $|f(z)|$ is bounded below. This is a sufficient condition (as we will see), but it is not necessary. For instance, $f_n(z) = 2$ for all $n$ converges to $f(z)=2$. Also $f_n(z)=z+2$ converges uniformly to $f(z)=z+2$ on the unit disk $K$. $f(z)$ is not constant, but it is non-vanishing on $K$. The reciprocals $1/(z+2)$ will converge uniformly. Thus, this condition is too strong.\n*   E. The functions $f_n$ must be polynomials. This is not necessary. For example, $f_n(z) = \\exp(z/n) + 2$ are not polynomials, but they converge uniformly to $f(z)=3$ on any compact set $K$. The reciprocals converge uniformly.\n*   D. The sequence of derivatives $\\{f_n'\\}$ must converge uniformly on $K$. By the Weierstrass theorem on derivatives of holomorphic functions, this would imply $f_n \\to f$ uniformly. However, this is not directly related to the convergence of reciprocals. In our counterexample, $f_n(x) = x+1/n$, we have $f_n'(x)=1$ which converges uniformly to $f'(x)=1$. Yet, the reciprocals did not converge uniformly. So this is not a sufficient condition.\n\n*   C. The limit function $f$ must have no zeros on the set $K$.\n    *   **Necessity**: Suppose $g_n \\to g$ uniformly on $K$. The functions $g_n(z) = 1/f_n(z)$ are continuous on the compact set $K$ (since $f_n$ are continuous and non-zero on $K$). The uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. So $g(z) = 1/f(z)$ must be continuous on $K$. A function is continuous only where it is defined, so $1/f(z)$ must be defined for all $z \\in K$, which means $f(z) \\neq 0$ for all $z \\in K$. This shows the condition is necessary.\n    *   **Sufficiency**: Assume $f(z) \\neq 0$ for all $z \\in K$. Since $f$ is the uniform limit of continuous functions, $f$ is continuous. The function $|f(z)|$ is a continuous real-valued function on the compact set $K$. By the extreme value theorem, $|f(z)|$ must attain its minimum value on $K$. Let this minimum be $m = \\min_{z \\in K} |f(z)|$. Since $f(z)$ is never zero on $K$, we must have $m > 0$.\n    Since $f_n \\to f$ uniformly on $K$, for $\\epsilon = m/2 > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$ and all $z \\in K$, we have $|f_n(z) - f(z)|  m/2$.\n    Using the reverse triangle inequality for $n > N$:\n    $|f_n(z)| = |f(z) - (f(z) - f_n(z))| \\ge |f(z)| - |f_n(z) - f(z)| > m - m/2 = m/2$.\n    So, for $n > N$, $|f_n(z)|$ is also bounded below by a positive constant $m/2$.\n    Now, let's look at the difference between the reciprocals for $n > N$:\n    $$|g_n(z) - g(z)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{f_n(z)} - \\frac{1}{f(z)}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{f(z) - f_n(z)}{f_n(z)f(z)}\\right| = \\frac{|f(z) - f_n(z)|}{|f_n(z)||f(z)|}$$\n    Using our lower bounds for the denominators:\n    $$|g_n(z) - g(z)| \\le \\frac{|f_n(z) - f(z)|}{(m/2) \\cdot m} = \\frac{2}{m^2}|f_n(z) - f(z)|$$\n    Taking the supremum over $z \\in K$:\n    $$\\sup_{z \\in K}|g_n(z) - g(z)| \\le \\frac{2}{m^2} \\sup_{z \\in K}|f_n(z) - f(z)|$$\n    Since $f_n \\to f$ uniformly on $K$, we know that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sup_{z \\in K}|f_n(z) - f(z)| = 0$. Since $2/m^2$ is a fixed positive constant, the right side goes to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$. By the squeeze theorem, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sup_{z \\in K}|g_n(z) - g(z)| = 0$. This proves uniform convergence.\n\nTherefore, the condition that the limit function $f$ must have no zeros on the set $K$ is both necessary and sufficient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2286552"}]}
