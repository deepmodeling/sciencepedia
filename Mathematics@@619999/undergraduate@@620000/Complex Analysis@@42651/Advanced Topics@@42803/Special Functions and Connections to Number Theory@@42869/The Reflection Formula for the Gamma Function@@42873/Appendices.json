We will calculate each of the two Gamma function values separately before multiplying them.\n\nFirst, let's determine the value of $\\Gamma(3/2)$. We can write the argument $3/2$ as $1/2 + 1$.

The argument $-1/2$ does not immediately fit the form $z+1$ where $\\Gamma(z)$ is known.

The relation $\\Gamma(z+1) = z\\Gamma(z)$ can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\Gamma(z) = \\frac{\\Gamma(z+1)}{z}\n$$\nThis form is valid as long as $z$ is not zero. To find $\\Gamma(-1/2)$, we can set $z = -1/2$ in this rearranged formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma(-1/2) = \\frac{\\Gamma(-1/2 + 1)}{-1/2}\n$$\nThe argument in the numerator simplifies to $-1/2 + 1 = 1/2$.
