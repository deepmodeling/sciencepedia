The strategy is to substitute the series expansions for $\\wp(z)$ and its derivative $\\wp'(z)$ into the differential equation and then equate the coefficients of like powers of $z$.\n\nFirst, we write down the given Laurent series for $\\wp(z)$ and find the series for its derivative, $\\wp'(z)$.\nGiven the series for $\\wp(z)$:\n$$ \\wp(z) = z^{-2} + c_2 z^2 + c_4 z^4 + c_6 z^6 + \\dots $$\nDifferentiating term by term with respect to $z$, we get the series for $\\wp'(z)$:\n$$ \\wp'(z) = -2z^{-3} + 2c_2 z + 4c_4 z^3 + 6c_6 z^5 + \\dots $$\n\nNext, we expand the left-hand side (LHS) of the differential equation, $(\\wp'(z))^2$. We need to expand this up to the constant term to find an equation involving $c_4$.\n$$ (\\wp'(z))^2 = (-2z^{-3} + 2c_2 z + 4c_4 z^3 + \\dots)^2 $$\nExpanding the square, we collect terms based on their power of $z$:\nThe most singular term is $(-2z^{-3})^2 = 4z^{-6}$.\nThe next term comes from the cross-product of the first two terms in the expansion of $\\wp'(z)$: $2(-2z^{-3})(2c_2 z) = -8c_2 z^{-2}$.\nThe constant term ($z^0$) arises from the cross-product of the $z^{-3}$ and $z^3$ terms, $2(-2z^{-3})(4c_4 z^3)$, and the square of the $z$ term, $(2c_2z)^2$. Oh wait, the constant term only comes from $2(-2z^{-3})(4c_4z^3)$ and $(2c_2z)^2$ contributes to the $z^2$ term. Let's recheck.\nA constant term can be formed by multiplying terms whose powers sum to zero. For $(-2z^{-3} + 2c_2 z + 4c_4 z^3 + \\dots)^2$, the products are:\n- $(-2z^{-3}) \\times (4c_4 z^3)$: a cross product, so $2 \\times (-2z^{-3}) \\times (4c_4 z^3) = -16c_4$.\n- $(2c_2 z) \\times$ (no term with $z^{-1}$): No contribution.\nSo, the constant term is indeed $-16c_4$. The term $(2c_2 z)^2 = 4c_2^2 z^2$ is not a constant term. The solution text misses this potential source of confusion and just states the result, which is correct.\nSo, the series for the LHS up to the constant term is:\n$$ (\\wp'(z))^2 = 4z^{-6} - 8c_2 z^{-2} - 16c_4 + O(z^2) $$\n\nNow, we expand the right-hand side (RHS) of the differential equation, $4\\wp(z)^3 - g_2 \\wp(z) - g_3$.\nFirst, let's find the first few terms of $\\wp(z)^3$:\n$$ \\wp(z)^3 = (z^{-2} + c_2 z^2 + c_4 z^4 + \\dots)^3 $$\nWe can use the multinomial expansion.\nThe most singular term is $(z^{-2})^3 = z^{-6}$.\nThe term with $z^{-2}$ comes from $3(z^{-2})^2(c_2z^2) = 3c_2z^{-2}$.\nThe constant term ($z^0$) comes from $3(z^{-2})^2(c_4z^4) = 3c_4$ and also from $3(z^{-2})(c_2z^2)^2 = 3c_2^2 z^2$. No, that's a $z^2$ term. Let's be careful. For $(a+b+c)^3$, the constant term comes from combinations where powers sum to 0. Here, $a=z^{-2}, b=c_2z^2, c=c_4z^4$. The constant term in $(z^{-2} + c_2 z^2 + c_4 z^4)^3$ comes from $3(z^{-2})^2(c_4z^4) = 3c_4$. There is no other combination giving a constant term. For example, $6(z^{-2})(c_2z^2)(c_2z^2)$ gives $6c_2^2 z^2$. No, $6abc$ is $6(z^{-2})(c_2z^2)(c_4z^4)$ gives a $z^4$ term. Okay, so the constant term in $\\wp(z)^3$ is $3c_4$.\nSo, the expansion for $\\wp(z)^3$ is:\n$$ \\wp(z)^3 = z^{-6} + 3c_2 z^{-2} + 3c_4 + O(z^2) $$\nNow we can assemble the series for the entire RHS:\n$$ RHS = 4(z^{-6} + 3c_2 z^{-2} + 3c_4 + O(z^2)) - g_2(z^{-2} + c_2 z^2 + \\dots) - g_3 $$\n$$ RHS = 4z^{-6} + 12c_2 z^{-2} + 12c_4 + O(z^2) - g_2 z^{-2} - g_2 c_2 z^2 - \\dots - g_3 $$\nGrouping terms by powers of $z$:\n$$ RHS = 4z^{-6} + (12c_2 - g_2)z^{-2} + (12c_4 - g_3) + O(z^2) $$\n\nFinally, we equate the coefficients of the LHS and RHS series expansions.\n$$ 4z^{-6} - 8c_2 z^{-2} - 16c_4 + \\dots = 4z^{-6} + (12c_2 - g_2)z^{-2} + (12c_4 - g_3) + \\dots $$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $z^{-6}$:\n$4 = 4$.
