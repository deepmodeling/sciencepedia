Express your answer as a function of $C$.", "solution": "A complex function $f(z)$ is complex-differentiable at a point $z_0$ if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations at that point, and its first-order partial derivatives are continuous there. We begin by expressing the function $f(z)$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts.\n\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real variables that represent the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively. The complex conjugate is $\\bar{z} = x - iy$.\n\nWe can write the function $f(z)$ as $f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y)$, where $u(x,y)$ is the real part and $v(x,y)$ is the imaginary part of the function.\n\nFirst, let's expand the terms in the definition of $f(z)$:\n$z (\\bar{z})^2 = (x + iy)(x - iy)^2 = (x + iy)(x^2 - y^2 - 2ixy)$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$x(x^2 - y^2) - x(2ixy) + iy(x^2 - y^2) + iy(-2ixy)$\n$= (x^3 - xy^2) - 2ix^2y + i(x^2y - y^3) + 2xy^2$\n$= (x^3 - xy^2 + 2xy^2) + i(-2x^2y + x^2y - y^3)$\n$= (x^3 + xy^2) + i(-x^2y - y^3)$\n\nThe second term of $f(z)$ is:\n$-C\\bar{z} = -C(x - iy) = -Cx + iCy$\n\nCombining these two parts to form $f(z)$:\n$f(z) = (x^3 + xy^2 - Cx) + i(-x^2y - y^3 + Cy)$\n\nFrom this expression, we can identify the real part $u(x, y)$ and the imaginary part $v(x, y)$:\n$u(x, y) = x^3 + xy^2 - Cx$\n$v(x, y) = -x^2y - y^3 + Cy$\n\nFor $f(z)$ to be complex-differentiable, the Cauchy-Riemann equations must be satisfied:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nWe compute the four necessary partial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 + xy^2 - Cx) = 3x^2 + y^2 - C$\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 + xy^2 - Cx) = 2xy$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-x^2y - y^3 + Cy) = -2xy$\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-x^2y - y^3 + Cy) = -x^2 - 3y^2 + C$\n\nThese partial derivatives are polynomials in $x$ and $y$, so they are continuous everywhere in the complex plane. Thus, the condition for differentiability reduces to satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nNow, we apply the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\nFrom the second equation, $u_y = -v_x$:\n$2xy = -(-2xy) \\implies 2xy = 2xy$\nThis equation is satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ in the complex plane.\n\nFrom the first equation, $u_x = v_y$:\n$3x^2 + y^2 - C = -x^2 - 3y^2 + C$\nRearranging the terms to group $x$ and $y$ on one side:\n$3x^2 + x^2 + y^2 + 3y^2 = C + C$\n$4x^2 + 4y^2 = 2C$\nDividing by 4, we get:\n$x^2 + y^2 = \\frac{C}{2}$\n\nThis is the equation of a circle in the $xy$-plane centered at the origin $(0, 0)$. The standard equation for such a circle is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.\nBy comparing our result with the standard form, we can see that the square of the radius is $r^2 = \\frac{C}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the radius $r$ of the circle on which $f(z)$ is complex-differentiable is:\n$r = \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{2}}$\nSince $C$ is given as a positive real constant, the radius is a positive real number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{C}{2}}}$$", "id": "2272920"}]}
