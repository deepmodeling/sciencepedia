There is no contradiction here because $S(z)=\\frac{1}{z-3}-\\frac{1}{z}$ is not itself a Laurent series centered at $0$; it is an algebraic expression that must be converted into a series in powers of $z$ and $z^{-1}$ to qualify as a Laurent series about $z=0$.

Hence the uniqueness theorem is preserved.\n\nThus the correct resolution is that $S(z)$ is not a Laurent series centered at $z_{0}=0$ because $\\frac{1}{z-3}$ is not expressed in powers of $z$ and $z^{-1}$; only after expansion does one obtain the unique Laurent series $L(z)$ valid in the annulus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2285654"}, {"introduction": "The uniqueness theorem is not just a theoretical statement; it is a powerful, practical tool for deducing the structure of a function's Laurent series from its known properties.
