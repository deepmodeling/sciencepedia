Finding the coefficient of $z^4$, which is $a_4$, by direct differentiation would be very tedious. A more efficient method is to use the known Maclaurin series for the components of the function $f(z)$.\n\nThe function $f(z)$ can be expressed as the product of two functions: $g(z) = \\log(1+z)$ and $h(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}$. We can find the Maclaurin series for each of these functions and then multiply them.\n\nThe Maclaurin series for $g(z) = \\log(1+z)$, valid for $|z|  1$, is:\n$$\ng(z) = \\log(1+z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{k-1} \\frac{z^k}{k} = z - \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\frac{z^3}{3} - \\frac{z^4}{4} + O(z^5)\n$$\nHere, $O(z^5)$ represents terms of order $z^5$ and higher, which we do not need to find the coefficient of $z^4$.\n\nThe Maclaurin series for $h(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}$ is the standard geometric series, valid for $|z|  1$:\n$$\nh(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} z^k = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + O(z^5)\n$$\n\nNow, we multiply these two series to find the series for $f(z) = g(z)h(z)$:\n$$\nf(z) = \\left( z - \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\frac{z^3}{3} - \\frac{z^4}{4} + \\dots \\right) \\left( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + \\dots \\right)\n$$\n\nWe are interested in the coefficient of the $z^4$ term.
