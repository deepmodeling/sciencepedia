To find the Laurent series of their product, we can multiply their individual series expansions around $z=0$.\n\nFirst, let's find the series for $g(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z^2}$. This function is analytic at $z=0$. We can use the formula for a geometric series, $\\frac{1}{1-w} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} w^n$, which is valid for $|w|<1$.

The coefficient of the resulting term ($z^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3!z^3} = \\frac{1}{3!z}$) is $1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3!} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n- For $n=2$, the term from the first series is $z^4$.
