This is not necessary, as the example $f \\equiv 0$ and $g \\equiv 1$ satisfies $fg \\equiv 0$ while only one function vanishes identically. Hence C is false.\n- Statement D claims the sets of zeros of $f$ and $g$ are identical in $D$. Using the same example $f \\equiv 0$ and $g \\equiv 1$, the zero set of $f$ is all of $D$ while the zero set of $g$ is empty; these are not identical. Hence D is false.\n- Statement E claims $f$ and $g$ must be polynomials.
