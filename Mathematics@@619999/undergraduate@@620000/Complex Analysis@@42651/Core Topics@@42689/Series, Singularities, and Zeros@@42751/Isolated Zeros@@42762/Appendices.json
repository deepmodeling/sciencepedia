{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The order of a zero provides a precise measure of how an analytic function approaches zero at a specific point. The key to determining this order lies in the function's Taylor series expansion; if the series around $z_0$ begins with the term $c_k(z-z_0)^k$ where the coefficient $c_k \\neq 0$, the order of the zero is defined as the integer $k$. This exercise ([@problem_id:2248487]) offers direct practice in applying this fundamental definition, requiring you to skillfully manipulate the well-known Maclaurin series of elementary functions to classify the zero of a more complex function.", "problem": "Consider the complex-valued function $f(z)$ defined for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ by the expression:\n$$f(z) = \\exp(z^2) - 1 - z^2 \\cos(z)$$\nThe function $f(z)$ has a zero at the origin, $z=0$.
