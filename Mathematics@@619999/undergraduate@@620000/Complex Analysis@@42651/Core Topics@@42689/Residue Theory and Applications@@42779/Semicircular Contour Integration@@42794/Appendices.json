We consider the complex function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^4 + z^2 + 1}$. The integral can be found by evaluating the contour integral $\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz$ over a specific contour $C$ and then taking a limit.\n\nThe standard contour for this type of integral is a semicircle in the upper half of the complex plane. Let $C$ be the closed contour consisting of the line segment from $-R$ to $R$ on the real axis, and the semicircle $\\Gamma_R$ of radius $R$ in the upper half-plane, centered at the origin, traversed counter-clockwise. For $R$ large enough, this contour will enclose all the poles of $f(z)$ in the upper half-plane.\n\nFirst, we find the poles of $f(z)$ by solving for the roots of the denominator: $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$.\nLet $u = z^2$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $u$: $u^2 + u + 1 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots for $u$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\nThese two values for $u$ are the non-real cube roots of unity. In polar form, they are $u_1 = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ and $u_2 = e^{i4\\pi/3}$.\n\nNow we solve for $z$ from $z^2 = u$.\nCase 1: $z^2 = u_1 = e^{i2\\pi/3}$.\nThe solutions are $z = (e^{i2\\pi/3})^{1/2}$, which gives $z_1 = e^{i\\pi/3}$ and $z_2 = e^{i(\\pi/3 + \\pi)} = e^{i4\\pi/3}$.\n\nCase 2: $z^2 = u_2 = e^{i4\\pi/3}$.\nThe solutions are $z = (e^{i4\\pi/3})^{1/2}$, which gives $z_3 = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ and $z_4 = e^{i(2\\pi/3 + \\pi)} = e^{i5\\pi/3}$.\n\nThe four poles of $f(z)$ are $e^{i\\pi/3}$, $e^{i2\\pi/3}$, $e^{i4\\pi/3}$, and $e^{i5\\pi/3}$. We are interested in the poles located in the upper half-plane, which are those with a positive imaginary part. The poles in the upper half-plane correspond to angles between $0$ and $\\pi$. These are $z_1 = e^{i\\pi/3}$ and $z_3 = e^{i2\\pi/3}$.\nIn Cartesian coordinates:\n$z_1 = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) + i\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n$z_3 = \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) + i\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\nAll poles are simple. The residue of $f(z) = \\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}$ at a simple pole $z_k$ is given by the formula $\\text{Res}(f, z_k) = \\frac{P(z_k)}{Q'(z_k)}$.\nHere, $P(z) = 1$ and $Q(z) = z^4 + z^2 + 1$, so $Q'(z) = 4z^3 + 2z$.\n\nLet's calculate the residue at $z_1 = e^{i\\pi/3}$:\nNote that $z_1^3 = (e^{i\\pi/3})^3 = e^{i\\pi} = -1$.\n$$\n\\text{Res}(f, z_1) = \\frac{1}{4z_1^3 + 2z_1} = \\frac{1}{4(-1) + 2z_1} = \\frac{1}{2z_1 - 4} = \\frac{1}{2(\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) - 4} = \\frac{1}{1 + i\\sqrt{3} - 4} = \\frac{1}{-3 + i\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n$$\n\\text{Res}(f, z_1) = \\frac{1}{-3 + i\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{-3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{-3 - i\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{-3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{(-3)^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{-3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{9+3} = \\frac{-3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{12}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the residue at $z_3 = e^{i2\\pi/3}$:\nNote that $z_3^3 = (e^{i2\\pi/3})^3 = e^{i2\\pi} = 1$.\n$$\n\\text{Res}(f, z_3) = \\frac{1}{4z_3^3 + 2z_3} = \\frac{1}{4(1) + 2z_3} = \\frac{1}{4 + 2z_3} = \\frac{1}{4 + 2(-\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{1}{4 - 1 + i\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{3 + i\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nAgain, we multiply by the conjugate:\n$$\n\\text{Res}(f, z_3) = \\frac{1}{3 + i\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{3 - i\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{3^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{9+3} = \\frac{3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{12}\n$$\n\nBy the Residue Theorem, the integral over the closed contour $C$ is $2\\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of the poles inside $C$.\n$$\n\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\left( \\text{Res}(f, z_1) + \\text{Res}(f, z_3) \\right)\n$$\nSumming the residues:\n$$\n\\sum \\text{Res} = \\frac{-3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{12} + \\frac{3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{12} = \\frac{-2i\\sqrt{3}}{12} = -i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}\n$$\nSo, the contour integral is:\n$$\n\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\left(-i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right) = -2\\pi i^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2\\pi \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n$$\n\nThe contour integral can also be split into two parts:\n$$\n\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = \\int_{-R}^{R} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{\\Gamma_R} f(z) \\, dz\n$$\nWe need to show that the integral over the semicircle $\\Gamma_R$ vanishes as $R \\to \\infty$.
