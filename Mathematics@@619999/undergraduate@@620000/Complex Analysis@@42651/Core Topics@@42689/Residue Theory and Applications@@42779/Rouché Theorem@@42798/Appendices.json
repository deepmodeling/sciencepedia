We will use Rouché's Theorem to solve this problem.\n\nRouché's Theorem states that if $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are two functions analytic inside and on a simple closed contour $C$, and if $|g(z)| < |f(z)|$ for all $z$ on $C$, then $f(z)$ and $f(z) + g(z)$ have the same number of zeros inside $C$, counted with multiplicity.\n\nLet's choose our contour $C$ to be the boundary of the unit disk, which is the unit circle $|z|=1$.\nWe need to split our function $h(z) = e^z - 3z^n$ into two parts, $f(z)$ and $g(z)$, such that $h(z) = f(z)+g(z)$ and the inequality condition of Rouché's theorem is satisfied on $|z|=1$.\n\nLet's define $f(z) = -3z^n$ and $g(z) = e^z$.\nBoth functions are entire, so they are analytic everywhere, including inside and on the unit circle.\nNow we must check the condition $|g(z)| < |f(z)|$ for all $z$ on the unit circle $|z|=1$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the magnitude of $f(z)$ on the unit circle. For any $z$ such that $|z|=1$:\n$$|f(z)| = |-3z^n| = |-3| \\cdot |z^n| = 3 \\cdot |z|^n = 3 \\cdot 1^n = 3.$$\nSo, on the contour $C$, the magnitude of $f(z)$ is constant and equal to 3.\n\nNext, let's compute the magnitude of $g(z)$ on the unit circle. Let $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are the real and imaginary parts of $z$. For any $z$ on the unit circle, we have $|z|^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\nThe magnitude of $g(z)$ is:\n$$|g(z)| = |e^z| = |e^{x+iy}| = |e^x e^{iy}| = |e^x| \\cdot |e^{iy}|.$$\nSince $x$ is a real number, $|e^x| = e^x$. The term $e^{iy}$ represents a point on the unit circle in the complex plane (since $|e^{iy}| = |\\cos(y) + i\\sin(y)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(y)+\\sin^2(y)} = 1$).\nTherefore, we have:\n$$|g(z)| = e^x.$$\nFor a point $z=x+iy$ on the unit circle $|z|=1$, the real part $x$ is constrained by $-1 \\le x \\le 1$. The maximum value of $x$ is $1$ (at $z=1$), and the minimum is $-1$ (at $z=-1$).\nThe maximum value of $|g(z)|$ on the unit circle is thus $e^1 = e$.\nThe mathematical constant $e \\approx 2.71828$.\n\nNow we can compare the magnitudes of $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ on the circle $|z|=1$:\n$$|g(z)| = e^x \\le e \\approx 2.71828$$\n$$|f(z)| = 3$$\nSince $e < 3$, we have $|g(z)| < |f(z)|$ for all $z$ on the unit circle $|z|=1$.\n\nThe conditions for Rouché's Theorem are satisfied. The theorem implies that the number of zeros of $h(z) = f(z) + g(z) = e^z - 3z^n$ inside the unit disk is the same as the number of zeros of $f(z) = -3z^n$ inside the unit disk.\n\nNow we count the zeros of $f(z) = -3z^n$. The equation $f(z)=0$ is $-3z^n = 0$, which simplifies to $z^n=0$. This equation has a single root at $z=0$, and this root has multiplicity $n$.\nSince the zero is at $z=0$, and $|0| < 1$, this zero is located inside the unit disk.\n\nTherefore, the function $f(z)$ has $n$ zeros (counting multiplicities) inside the unit disk.
