By the argument principle via Rouché’s theorem, it suffices to count zeros inside $|z|2$ and inside $|z|1$ and subtract.\n\nFirst, count zeros inside $|z|2$. On $|z|=2$,\n$$\n|3 z^{4}|=3|z|^{4}=3\\cdot 2^{4}=48,\\quad |z^{5}+z^{3}+1|\\leq |z|^{5}+|z|^{3}+1=2^{5}+2^{3}+1=41.\n$$\nSince $48 > 41$, we have $|3 z^{4}|>|z^{5}+z^{3}+1|$ on $|z|=2$. By Rouché’s theorem, $P$ and $3 z^{4}$ have the same number of zeros in $|z|2$. The polynomial $3 z^{4}$ has exactly $4$ zeros in $|z|2$ (the root $z=0$ of multiplicity $4$), hence $P$ has $4$ zeros in $|z|2$. In particular, $P$ has no zeros on $|z|=2$.\n\nNext, we show $P$ has no zeros on $|z|=1$. Suppose $|z|=1$ and $P(z)=0$. Then\n$$\n|z^{5}+3 z^{4}+z^{3}|=|-1|=1.\n$$\nBy the reverse triangle inequality,\n$$\n|z^{5}+3 z^{4}+z^{3}|\\geq \\bigl||3 z^{4}|-|z^{5}+z^{3}|\\bigr|=3-|z^{5}+z^{3}|,\n$$\nso $1\\geq 3-|z^{5}+z^{3}|$, which implies $|z^{5}+z^{3}|\\geq 2$. On the other hand, by the triangle inequality and $|z|=1$,\n$$\n|z^{5}+z^{3}|\\leq |z^{5}|+|z^{3}|=2.\n$$\nHence $|z^{5}+z^{3}|=2$, and equality in the triangle inequality forces $z^{5}$ and $z^{3}$ to have the same argument. With $|z|=1$, this gives $z^{5}=z^{3}$, hence $z^{2}=1$ and $z=\\pm 1$. But $P(1)=1+3+1+1=6\\neq 0$ and $P(-1)=-1+3-1+1=2\\neq 0$, a contradiction. Therefore $P$ has no zeros on $|z|=1$.\n\nNow, for $r>1$ sufficiently close to $1$, compare $f(z)=z^{4}(z+3)$ and $g(z)=z^{3}+1$ on $|z|=r$. For $|z|=r$,\n$$\n|f(z)|=|z|^{4}|z+3|\\geq r^{4}\\bigl(3-|z|\\bigr)=r^{4}(3-r),\\quad |g(z)|\\leq |z|^{3}+1=r^{3}+1.\n$$\nDefine $h(r)=r^{4}(3-r)-(r^{3}+1)$. Then $h(1)=2-2=0$ and\n$$\nh'(r)=12 r^{3}-5 r^{4}-3 r^{2},\\quad h'(1)=4>0,\n$$\nso there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $h(r)>0$ for all $r\\in(1,1+\\delta)$. Thus, for each such $r$, on $|z|=r$ we have $|f(z)|>|g(z)|$, and Rouché’s theorem implies that $P$ and $f$ have the same number of zeros in $|z|r$. Since $f$ has the zeros $z=0$ (multiplicity $4$) and $z=-3$ (outside $|z|r$), $f$ has exactly $4$ zeros in $|z|r$. Therefore, for every $r\\in(1,1+\\delta)$, $P$ has exactly $4$ zeros in $|z|r$.\n\nBecause $P$ has no zeros on $|z|=1$, letting $r\\to 1^{+}$ shows that $P$ has exactly $4$ zeros in $|z|1$. From the first part, $P$ has exactly $4$ zeros in $|z|2$. Hence the number of zeros with $1|z|2$ equals $4-4=0$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of zeros of $P$ in the annulus $1|z|2$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2229395"}]}
