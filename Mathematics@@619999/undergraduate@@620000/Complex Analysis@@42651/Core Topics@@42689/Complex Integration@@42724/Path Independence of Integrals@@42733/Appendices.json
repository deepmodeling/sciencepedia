This exercise provides a direct, hands-on calculation to demonstrate that for some functions, the path of integration matters.

We must compute each integral separately and then find their difference. The function is $f(z) = \\text{Im}(z)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the integral $I_1$ along the straight line path $C_1$ from $z_1 = 0$ to $z_2 = 1 - i$.\nA parametrization for the straight line segment from a point $a$ to a point $b$ is $z(t) = a + t(b-a)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nFor path $C_1$, we have $a=0$ and $b=1-i$.\nSo, the parametrization is $z(t) = 0 + t(1-i - 0) = t(1-i) = t - it$, for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nFrom this parametrization, we have $x(t) = t$ and $y(t) = -t$.\nThe function $f(z)$ evaluated on the path is $f(z(t)) = \\text{Im}(z(t)) = y(t) = -t$.\nThe differential element $dz$ is found by differentiating $z(t)$ with respect to $t$: $z'(t) = \\frac{dz}{dt} = 1 - i$.

The integral over $C_2$ is the sum of the integrals over its segments: $I_2 = \\int_{C_{2a}} f(z) dz + \\int_{C_{2b}} f(z) dz$.\n\nLet's compute the integral over the first segment, $C_{2a}$, from $z_1=0$ to $z_3=1$.\nThe parametrization is $z(t) = t$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nHere, $y(t) = 0$. The function on the path is $f(z(t)) = \\text{Im}(t) = 0$.\nThe differential is $dz = dt$.\nThe integral over $C_{2a}$ is:\n$$\\int_{C_{2a}} f(z) dz = \\int_0^1 (0) dt = 0$$\n\nNow, let's compute the integral over the second segment, $C_{2b}$, from $z_3=1$ to $z_2=1-i$.\nThe parametrization is $z(t) = 1 + t((1-i) - 1) = 1 - it$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nHere, $x(t)=1$ and $y(t)=-t$. The function on the path is $f(z(t)) = \\text{Im}(1-it) = -t$.\nThe differential is $dz = -i dt$.\nThe integral over $C_{2b}$ is:\n$$\\int_{C_{2b}} f(z) dz = \\int_0^1 (-t)(-i) dt = i \\int_0^1 t dt = i \\left[ \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right]_0^1 = i \\left( \\frac{1^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{i}{2}$$\n\nThe total integral $I_2$ is the sum of the integrals over the two segments:\n$$I_2 = \\int_{C_{2a}} f(z) dz + \\int_{C_{2b}} f(z) dz = 0 + \\frac{i}{2} = \\frac{i}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $I_1 - I_2$:\n$$I_1 - I_2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe difference between the two integrals is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.
