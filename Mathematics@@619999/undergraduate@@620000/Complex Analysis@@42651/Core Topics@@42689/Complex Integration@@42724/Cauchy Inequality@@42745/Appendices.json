For an analytic function $f(z)$, the inequality is stated as $|f^{(n)}(a)| \\le \\frac{n! M_r}{r^n}$, where $M_r$ is the maximum of $|f(z)|$ on the circle $|z-a|=r$. This first practice provides a direct application of this principle, challenging you to find the optimal bound by carefully considering the geometry of the function's domain, a crucial skill for applying this theorem effectively.

The largest disk centered at $a$ that is contained within the domain of analyticity $|z|<4$ has radius $r_{max} = 4-|a| = 4-2=2$.
