The series of absolute values is:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n| = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\dots = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} $$\nThis is the harmonic series. It is a well-known result that the harmonic series is a p-series with $p=1$, and it diverges. Since the series of absolute values diverges, the series $S$ does not converge absolutely. This eliminates option A.\n\nNext, we must determine if the series converges conditionally or diverges. We can analyze the convergence of the series $S$ by grouping the terms in blocks of three, following the given pattern: $(+,-,-)$. Let $S_N$ be the $N$-th partial sum of the series. We will analyze the behavior of the subsequence of partial sums $S_{3n}$, where each partial sum ends after a complete block of three terms.\n$$ S_{3n} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{3k-2} - \\frac{1}{3k-1} - \\frac{1}{3k} \\right) $$\nLet $b_k = \\frac{1}{3k-2} - \\frac{1}{3k-1} - \\frac{1}{3k}$. The series $S$ converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums $S_N$ converges. The convergence of the subsequence $S_{3n} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k$ provides strong evidence for the behavior of $S_N$. Let's combine the terms of $b_k$ over a common denominator:\n$$ b_k = \\frac{(3k-1)(3k) - (3k-2)(3k) - (3k-2)(3k-1)}{(3k-2)(3k-1)(3k)} $$\nExpanding the products in the numerator, we get:\nNumerator $= (9k^2 - 3k) - (9k^2 - 6k) - (9k^2 - 9k + 2)$\n$$ = 9k^2 - 3k - 9k^2 + 6k - 9k^2 + 9k - 2 $$\n$$ = -9k^2 + 12k - 2 $$\nSo, the general term of the grouped series is:\n$$ b_k = \\frac{-9k^2 + 12k - 2}{(3k-2)(3k-1)(3k)} $$\nTo determine the convergence of the series $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} b_k$, we can use the Limit Comparison Test. We compare it with the harmonic series $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k$, where $c_k = \\frac{1}{k}$. We compute the limit of the ratio $\\frac{b_k}{c_k}$:\n$$ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{b_k}{c_k} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{-9k^2 + 12k - 2}{(3k-2)(3k-1)(3k)}}{\\frac{1}{k}} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{k(-9k^2 + 12k - 2)}{(3k-2)(3k-1)(3k)} $$\n$$ = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{-9k^3 + 12k^2 - 2k}{27k^3 - 27k^2 + 6k} $$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $k$, which is $k^3$:\n$$ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{-9 + \\frac{12}{k} - \\frac{2}{k^2}}{27 - \\frac{27}{k} + \\frac{6}{k^2}} = \\frac{-9}{27} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\nSince this limit is a finite, non-zero constant, the Limit Comparison Test states that $\\sum b_k$ and $\\sum c_k$ have the same convergence behavior. As the harmonic series $\\sum c_k = \\sum \\frac{1}{k}$ diverges, the series $\\sum b_k$ must also diverge.\n\nFurthermore, for $k \\ge 1$, the numerator $-9k^2 + 12k - 2$ is always negative. Thus, all terms $b_k$ are negative. Because $\\sum b_k$ diverges and its terms are negative, the sum must diverge to $-\\infty$. This means the subsequence of partial sums $S_{3n}$ diverges to $-\\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} S_{3n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k = -\\infty $$\nNow we must check if the entire sequence of partial sums $S_N$ diverges to $-\\infty$.
