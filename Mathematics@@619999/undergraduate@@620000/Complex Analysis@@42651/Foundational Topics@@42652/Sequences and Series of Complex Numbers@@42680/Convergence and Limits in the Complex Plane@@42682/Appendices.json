Just as in real-variable calculus, the familiar algebraic rules for limits—such as the limit of a sum being the sum of the limits—also apply to sequences of complex numbers. This exercise provides practice in applying these rules, allowing you to compute the limit of a more complex sequence built from simpler ones whose limits are known.
