The function $z\\mapsto\\operatorname{Im}(z)$ is continuous, and $(0,\\infty)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$, so $S_{A}$ is open as the preimage of an open set under a continuous map. The set is convex (for any $z_{1},z_{2}$ with $\\operatorname{Im}(z_{j})0$, the segment $tz_{1}+(1-t)z_{2}$ satisfies $\\operatorname{Im}(tz_{1}+(1-t)z_{2})=t\\operatorname{Im}(z_{1})+(1-t)\\operatorname{Im}(z_{2})0$ for all $t\\in(0,1)$), hence connected. It is non-empty. Therefore $S_{A}$ is a domain.\n\nSet $S_{B}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:1|z|3\\}$. The function $z\\mapsto|z|$ is continuous, and $(1,3)$ is open, hence $S_{B}$ is open. To show connectedness, note that $S_{B}$ is path-connected: for any $z_{1},z_{2}$ with $1|z_{j}|3$, one can join $z_{1}$ to $z_{2}$ by a path that first moves radially at fixed argument from $|z_{1}|$ to any $r\\in(1,3)$, then along the circle of radius $r$ to the argument of $z_{2}$, then radially to $|z_{2}|$; all intermediate radii stay in $(1,3)$. Hence $S_{B}$ is connected and non-empty, so $S_{B}$ is a domain.\n\nSet $S_{C}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:\\operatorname{Re}(z^{2})1\\}$. The map $z\\mapsto\\operatorname{Re}(z^{2})$ is continuous, and $(-\\infty,1)$ is open, so $S_{C}$ is open. Write $z=x+iy$, so $z^{2}=x^{2}-y^{2}+i(2xy)$ and $\\operatorname{Re}(z^{2})=x^{2}-y^{2}$. Thus\n$$\nS_{C}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:x^{2}-y^{2}1\\}.\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to $y^{2}x^{2}-1$. For $|x|1$, this holds for all $y\\in\\mathbb{R}$, so the entire vertical strip $\\{(x,y):|x|1\\}$ lies in $S_{C}$. For $|x|\\geq 1$, it holds for $|y|\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}$. To prove connectedness, fix any point $(x_{0},y_{0})\\in S_{C}$. If $|x_{0}|1$, the point already lies in the strip, which is connected. If $|x_{0}|\\geq 1$, then $|y_{0}|\\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-1}$. Consider the horizontal path $t\\mapsto(x(t),y(t))$ with $x(t)=(1-t)x_{0}$, $y(t)=y_{0}$ for $t\\in[0,t_{1}]$, where $t_{1}$ is chosen so that $|x(t_{1})|=1$. For $t$ with $|x(t)|\\geq 1$, since $|x(t)|\\leq|x_{0}|$, we have $\\sqrt{x(t)^{2}-1}\\leq\\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-1}|y_{0}|$, so $x(t)^{2}-y_{0}^{2}1$. Thus the path remains in $S_{C}$ until it reaches $|x|=1$, and then it enters the strip $|x|1$, where all $y$ are allowed. Hence every point can be connected by a path within $S_{C}$ to the strip, and within the strip any two points can be connected by a straight-line path. Therefore $S_{C}$ is path-connected, hence connected. It is non-empty. Thus $S_{C}$ is a domain.\n\nSet $S_{D}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:\\operatorname{Re}(z)\\neq\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\}$. The set $\\{z:\\operatorname{Re}(z)=\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\}$ is a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which is closed, so its complement $S_{D}$ is open and non-empty.

Hence no neighborhood of $(1,0)$ is contained in $S$, so $S$ is not open. Therefore, $S$ cannot be a domain (a domain must be open and connected), so option A is false and option B is false.\n\nSecond, $S$ is connected. In fact, $S$ is convex: if $(x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2})\\in S$ and $t\\in[0,1]$, then by the triangle inequality,\n$$\n|t x_{1}+(1-t)x_{2}|+|t y_{1}+(1-t)y_{2}|\n\\leq t(|x_{1}|+|y_{1}|)+(1-t)(|x_{2}|+|y_{2}|)\n\\leq t(1) + (1-t)(1) = 1.\n$$\nThus the line segment joining any two points of $S$ lies in $S$, so $S$ is path-connected and hence connected.
