Let an arbitrary point in the complex plane be $w = a + ib$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We want to test if $w$ is a limit point of $S$.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$. We need to find a point $z = x+iy \\in S$ such that $z \\neq w$ and $|z-w| < \\epsilon$. The condition $|z-w| < \\epsilon$ is equivalent to $|(x-a) + i(y-b)| < \\epsilon$, which in turn is equivalent to $\\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} < \\epsilon$.\n\nA sufficient (though not necessary) way to satisfy this inequality is to find $x$ and $y$ (which define a point $z \\in S$) such that $|x-a| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $|y-b| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{2}}$.

Let $Q_{odd}$ be the set of rational numbers which, in reduced form, have an odd denominator. We need to show that for any real number $c$ (representing either $a$ or $b$) and any $\\delta > 0$ (representing $\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{2}}$), the interval $(c-\\delta, c+\\delta)$ contains a number from $Q_{odd}$. In other words, we need to show that $Q_{odd}$ is a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\delta > 0$. We want to find a rational number $p/q \\in Q_{odd}$ such that $c-\\delta < p/q < c+\\delta$. This is equivalent to finding an integer $p$ and an odd integer $q$ such that $q(c-\\delta) < p < q(c+\\delta)$.\n\nFor an integer $p$ to exist in the interval $(q(c-\\delta), q(c+\\delta))$, the length of the interval must be greater than 1. The length is $q(c+\\delta) - q(c-\\delta) = 2q\\delta$. So, we need to choose an odd integer $q$ such that $2q\\delta > 1$, or $q > \\frac{1}{2\\delta}$.\nSince we can always find an odd integer larger than any given real number, we can certainly find an odd integer $q$ that satisfies $q > \\frac{1}{2\\delta}$.\n\nFor such a choice of $q$, the interval $(q(c-\\delta), q(c+\\delta))$ has a length greater than 1 and is therefore guaranteed to contain at least one integer $p$. With this integer $p$ and odd integer $q$, we have constructed a rational number $p/q$ such that $|p/q - c| < \\delta$.\n\nNow we must consider the condition that the fraction must be in lowest terms. Let $p/q$ be the fraction found above. If $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$, then $p/q \\in Q_{odd}$ since $q$ is odd, and we are done with this part of the proof. If $\\gcd(p, q) = d > 1$, we can write $p = dp'$ and $q = dq'$ where $\\gcd(p', q')=1$. Since $q$ is odd, any of its divisors, including $d$, must also be odd. Because $q = dq'$, and both $q$ and $d$ are odd, $q'$ must also be odd. Therefore, the reduced fraction $p'/q'$ has an odd denominator $q'$, so $p'/q' \\in Q_{odd}$.\nThis shows that for any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any $\\delta > 0$, there exists a rational number in $Q_{odd}$ within the interval $(c-\\delta, c+\\delta)$. Thus, the set $Q_{odd}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we return to the complex plane. For any $w = a+ib \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, let $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSince $Q_{odd}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we can find a number $x \\in Q_{odd}$ such that $|x-a| < \\delta$.\nSimilarly, we can find a number $y \\in Q_{odd}$ such that $|y-b| < \\delta$.\nThe complex number $z = x+iy$ is by definition in the set $S$. As shown before, $|z-w| < \\epsilon$.\nSince this can be done for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find a point $z \\in S$ arbitrarily close to $w$. This ensures we can always find a point $z \\in S$ inside the disk $D(w, \\epsilon)$ that is different from $w$.\n\nThis argument holds for any arbitrary point $w = a+ib \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, every point in the complex plane is a limit point of the set $S$. The set of limit points $S'$ is the entire complex plane, $\\mathbb{C}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2250417"}]}
