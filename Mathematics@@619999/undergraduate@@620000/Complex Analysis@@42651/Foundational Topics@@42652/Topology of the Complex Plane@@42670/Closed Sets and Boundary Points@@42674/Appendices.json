A point $p$ is a limit point of $S$ if every open disk centered at $p$ contains a point of $S$ different from $p$.\n\nFirst, we show that $0$ is a limit point of $S$. Let $\\epsilon>0$ be arbitrary. Choose any $r$ with $0<r<\\min\\{\\epsilon,1\\}$ and set $z=r\\in\\mathbb{C}$. Then $z\\neq 0$, $|z|=r\\leq 1$, so $z\\in S$, and $|z-0|=|z|=r<\\epsilon$. Since this holds for every $\\epsilon>0$, every open disk centered at $0$ contains a point of $S$ different from $0$, hence $0$ is a limit point of $S$.\n\nNext, consider any point $p$ with $|p|>1$. Define \n$$\nr=\\frac{|p|-1}{2}>0.\n$$\nIf $w$ satisfies $|w-p|<r$, then by the reverse triangle inequality,\n$$\n|w|\\geq |p|-|w-p|>|p|-r=|p|-\\frac{|p|-1}{2}=\\frac{|p|+1}{2}>1.\n$$\nThus every $w$ in the open disk $B(p,r)$ satisfies $|w|>1$, so $B(p,r)\\cap S=\\varnothing$. Therefore, $p$ is not a limit point of $S$ whenever $|p|>1$.\n\nFor points with $0<|p|<1$, each such $p$ is an interior point of $S$, so they are already in $S$ and also are limit points, but this does not add anything beyond $S$ itself in the closure. For points with $|p|=1$, these lie in $S$, and any open disk around such $p$ intersects points with $|z|<1$, which are in $S$, so they are also limit points already contained in $S$.\n\nCombining these, the only point not in $S$ that is a limit point of $S$ is $0$, and no points with $|p|>1$ are limit points.
