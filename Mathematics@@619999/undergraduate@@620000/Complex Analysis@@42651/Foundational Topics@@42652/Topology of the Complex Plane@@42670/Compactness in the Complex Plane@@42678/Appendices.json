By dissecting the assertion, you will learn to precisely identify the correct theoretical justification for why the continuous image of a compact set has certain properties [@problem_id:2279112].", "problem": "In complex analysis, the Open Mapping Theorem is a fundamental result concerning the properties of analytic functions. It states that if $U$ is a non-empty, open, connected subset of the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$ and $f: U \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a non-constant analytic function, then the image $f(U)$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nConsider the closed unit disk, defined as $\\overline{D(0,1)} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\le 1\\}$.

The assertion is correct. The Open Mapping Theorem can be applied to the interior of the disk, and by properties of analytic continuation, this forces the image of the boundary to be well-behaved, making the entire image set closed.\n\nB. The assertion is correct. Since the function is non-constant, the Open Mapping Theorem ensures the function maps the interior to an open set and the boundary to a boundary, thus preserving the closed property of the set.\n\nC. The assertion is incorrect. The Open Mapping Theorem applies only to open sets, not closed sets like $\\overline{D(0,1)}$. Therefore, one can construct a non-constant analytic function for which the image $f(\\overline{D(0,1)})$ is not a closed set.\n\nD. The assertion is incorrect. While the image $f(\\overline{D(0,1)})$ is always a closed set, this is a result of the continuity of analytic functions and the compactness of the closed disk, not a consequence of the Open Mapping Theorem.", "solution": "Let $U\\subset\\mathbb{C}$ be a domain containing the closed unit disk $\\overline{D(0,1)}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:|z|\\leq 1\\}$, and let $f:U\\to\\mathbb{C}$ be non-constant and analytic.\n\nFirst, recall the Open Mapping Theorem: if $V\\subset U$ is non-empty, open, and connected, then for non-constant analytic $f$, the image $f(V)$ is open in $\\mathbb{C}$. Applying this to the open unit disk $D(0,1)=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\\}$ yields that $f(D(0,1))$ is open. However, this theorem makes no claim about the image of closed sets, such as $\\overline{D(0,1)}$, nor about the behavior of the image of the boundary $\\partial D(0,1)$.\n\nNext, use compactness and continuity. In the metric space $\\mathbb{C}\\cong\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the Heine–Borel theorem states that a subset is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Therefore, $\\overline{D(0,1)}$ is compact. Since analytic functions are continuous on their domains, the restriction of $f$ to $\\overline{D(0,1)}$ is continuous. The continuous image of a compact set is compact, so $f(\\overline{D(0,1)})$ is compact. In a Hausdorff space such as $\\mathbb{C}$, compact subsets are closed. Hence $f(\\overline{D(0,1)})$ is closed.\n\nTherefore, the statement that $f(\\overline{D(0,1)})$ is closed is true, but this conclusion follows from continuity and compactness, not from the Open Mapping Theorem. Moreover, the Open Mapping Theorem does not imply any general boundary-to-boundary mapping property; in general, for a continuous function $f$ and a set $A$, one does not have $f(\\partial A)=\\partial f(A)$. Consequently, options asserting that the closedness follows as a direct consequence of the Open Mapping Theorem or that the boundary must map to the boundary are incorrect. It is also impossible to construct a counterexample where $f(\\overline{D(0,1)})$ is not closed, because compactness ensures closedness.\n\nThe most accurate choice is that the assertion is incorrect in attributing the closedness to the Open Mapping Theorem, while the closedness itself is guaranteed by continuity and compactness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2279112"}]}
