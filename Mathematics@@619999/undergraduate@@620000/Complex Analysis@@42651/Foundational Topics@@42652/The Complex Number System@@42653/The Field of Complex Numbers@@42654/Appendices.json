Express your answers in the Cartesian form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers expressed in their exact form (e.g., using fractions or radicals, not decimal approximations).", "solution": "The problem requires us to find all complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the equation $z^5 = -32$. This is equivalent to finding the five 5th roots of the complex number $-32$.\n\nFirst, we express the complex number $-32$ in its polar form, which is given by $R(\\cos\\Theta + i\\sin\\Theta)$ or $Re^{i\\Theta}$.\nThe modulus (magnitude) $R$ is the absolute value of $-32$.\n$R = |-32| = 32$.\nThe argument (angle) $\\Theta$ of $-32$ is the angle it makes with the positive real axis. Since $-32$ lies on the negative real axis, its principal argument is $\\Theta = \\pi$ radians.\nBecause the cosine and sine functions have a period of $2\\pi$, we can express the argument more generally as $\\Theta = \\pi + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$.\nSo, $-32$ in polar form is $32(\\cos(\\pi + 2k\\pi) + i\\sin(\\pi + 2k\\pi))$.\n\nNext, we represent the unknown complex number $z$ in its polar form: $z = r(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)$, where $r$ is the modulus of $z$ and $\\theta$ is its argument.\n\nUsing De Moivre's theorem, we can express $z^5$ as:\n$z^5 = [r(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)]^5 = r^5(\\cos(5\\theta) + i\\sin(5\\theta))$.\n\nNow we equate the two expressions for $z^5$:\n$r^5(\\cos(5\\theta) + i\\sin(5\\theta)) = 32(\\cos(\\pi + 2k\\pi) + i\\sin(\\pi + 2k\\pi))$.\n\nFor these two complex numbers to be equal, their moduli must be equal, and their arguments must be equal (or differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$).\nEquating the moduli:\n$r^5 = 32$\nSince $r$ must be a non-negative real number, we take the real 5th root:\n$r = \\sqrt[5]{32} = 2$.\n\nEquating the arguments:\n$5\\theta = \\pi + 2k\\pi$\n$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi + 2k\\pi}{5} = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{5}$.\n\nTo find the five distinct roots, we can use five consecutive integer values for $k$, for example, $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\nFor $k=0$: $\\theta_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{5}$\nFor $k=1$: $\\theta_1 = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}$\nFor $k=2$: $\\theta_2 = \\frac{5\\pi}{5} = \\pi$\nFor $k=3$: $\\theta_3 = \\frac{7\\pi}{5}$\nFor $k=4$: $\\theta_4 = \\frac{9\\pi}{5}$\n\nThe five roots in polar form are $z_k = 2\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{5}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{5}\\right)\\right)$.\nNow we convert each root to the Cartesian form $a+bi$. For this, we need the exact values of the sine and cosine functions.\n\nLet's find the values for $\\cos(\\pi/5)$ and $\\sin(\\pi/5)$. A known value related to the pentagon is $\\cos(\\pi/5) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4}$. We can derive $\\sin(\\pi/5)$ from this:\n$\\sin^2(\\pi/5) = 1 - \\cos^2(\\pi/5) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1+2\\sqrt{5}+5}{16} = 1 - \\frac{6+2\\sqrt{5}}{16} = \\frac{10-2\\sqrt{5}}{16}$.\nSince $\\pi/5$ is in the first quadrant, $\\sin(\\pi/5)$ is positive: $\\sin(\\pi/5) = \\frac{\\sqrt{10-2\\sqrt{5}}}{4}$.\n\nLet's also find values for the angle $3\\pi/5$. We use angle identities:\n$\\cos(3\\pi/5) = \\cos(\\pi - 2\\pi/5) = -\\cos(2\\pi/5)$.\n$\\cos(2\\pi/5) = \\cos(2 \\cdot \\pi/5) = 2\\cos^2(\\pi/5) - 1 = 2\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\right)^2-1 = \\frac{6+2\\sqrt{5}}{8}-1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{4}$.\nSo, $\\cos(3\\pi/5) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{4} = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\n$\\sin(3\\pi/5) = \\sin(\\pi - 2\\pi/5) = \\sin(2\\pi/5) = \\sqrt{1-\\cos^2(2pi/5)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10+2\\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10+2\\sqrt{5}}}{4}$.\n\nNow we can write down all five roots in Cartesian form:\n$z_0 = 2(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{5}) + i\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{5})) = 2\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{10-2\\sqrt{5}}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{10-2\\sqrt{5}}}{2}$.\n\n$z_1 = 2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{5}) + i\\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{5})) = 2\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{4} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{10+2\\sqrt{5}}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{10+2\\sqrt{5}}}{2}$.\n\n$z_2 = 2(\\cos(\\pi) + i\\sin(\\pi)) = 2(-1 + 0i) = -2$.\n\nFor the remaining roots, since the polynomial $z^5+32=0$ has real coefficients, its non-real roots must come in conjugate pairs.\n$z_3$ corresponds to $\\theta_3 = 7\\pi/5$. Since $7\\pi/5 + 3\\pi/5 = 2\\pi$, the angle for $z_3$ is conjugate to the angle for $z_1$. Therefore, $z_3$ is the complex conjugate of $z_1$.\n$z_3 = \\bar{z_1} = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{10+2\\sqrt{5}}}{2}$.\n\nSimilarly, for $z_4$, the angle is $\\theta_4 = 9\\pi/5$.
