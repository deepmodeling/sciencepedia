The problem asks for the Euclidean distance between these two points in the complex plane, which is given by the modulus of their difference, $|z_1 - z_2|$.\n\nFirst, we write down the explicit forms of $z_1$ and $z_2$ using the given formula for the roots of unity, $\\omega_k = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi k}{12}\\right) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\pi k}{6}\\right)$.\n\nFor $k=2$, the first state is:\n$$z_1 = \\omega_2 = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\n\nFor $k=7$, the second state is:\n$$z_2 = \\omega_7 = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)$$\n\nThe distance $d$ is $|z_1 - z_2|$. We can solve this geometrically. The roots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, so $|z_1| = |\\omega_2| = 1$ and $|z_2| = |\\omega_7| = 1$.
