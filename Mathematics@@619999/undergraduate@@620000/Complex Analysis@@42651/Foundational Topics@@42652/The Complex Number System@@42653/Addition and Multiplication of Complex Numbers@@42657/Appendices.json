We are interested in their product, $P = z_1 z_2$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the expressions for $z_1$ and $z_2$ into the product equation:\n$$P = (3 + 2i)(x + iy)$$\n\nNext, we expand the product by distributing the terms, following the rules of complex multiplication:\n$$P = 3(x) + 3(iy) + (2i)(x) + (2i)(iy)$$\n$$P = 3x + 3iy + 2ix + 2i^2y$$\n\nWe use the fundamental property of the imaginary unit, $i^2 = -1$, to simplify the last term:\n$$P = 3x + 3iy + 2ix - 2y$$\n\nTo identify the real and imaginary parts of the product $P$, we group the terms with and without the imaginary unit $i$:\n$$P = (3x - 2y) + (2x + 3y)i$$\n\nThe real part of $P$, denoted as $\\text{Re}(P)$, is the term without $i$. The imaginary part of $P$, denoted as $\\text{Im}(P)$, is the coefficient of $i$.\n$$\\text{Re}(P) = 3x - 2y$$\n$$\\text{Im}(P) = 2x + 3y$$\n\nThe problem states that the product $P$ must be a purely imaginary number. By definition, a complex number is purely imaginary if its real part is equal to zero. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\\text{Re}(P) = 0$$\n$$3x - 2y = 0$$\n\nThis equation establishes the relationship between $x$ and $y$ for $P$ to be purely imaginary. The problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{y}{x}$ for any non-zero $z_2$ that satisfies this condition. A non-zero $z_2$ implies that $x$ and $y$ are not both zero. If $x=0$, the condition becomes $-2y=0$, which implies $y=0$. This corresponds to $z_2=0$, which is excluded. Therefore, for any non-zero solution $z_2$, we must have $x \\neq 0$, and we can safely divide by $x$.\n\nWe rearrange the relationship to solve for the ratio $\\frac{y}{x}$:\n$$3x = 2y$$\n\nDividing both sides by $x$ (since $x \\neq 0$):\n$$3 = 2 \\frac{y}{x}$$\n\nFinally, we isolate the ratio $\\frac{y}{x}$:\n$$\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nThus, for any non-zero complex number $z_2 = x+iy$ where the product $(3+2i)z_2$ is purely imaginary, the ratio of its imaginary part to its real part is $\\frac{3}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "2226927"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple calculation, complex multiplication has a profound geometric meaning related to rotation and scaling in the plane.
