We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe arrival of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein pulses at the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) is described as a homogeneous Poisson process. Let $N(t)$ be the number of pulses that have arrived by time $t$. The process is characterized by a constant rate $\\lambda$, given as $\\lambda = 3$ pulses per hour.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a certain number of events occurring within a fixed time interval $T = 2$ hours. A fundamental and well-tested consequence of the axiomatic definition of a homogeneous Poisson process (independent and stationary increments, and specified infinitesimal probabilities) is that the number of events, let us call this random variable $X$, in any interval of duration $T$ follows a Poisson distribution. The parameter of this distribution, representing the mean number of events in the interval, is $\\mu = \\lambda T$.\n\nUsing the given values, we compute the mean number of pulses in a $2$-hour window:\n$$\n\\mu = \\lambda T = (3 \\text{ hours}^{-1}) \\times (2 \\text{ hours}) = 6\n$$\nTherefore, the number of FT pulses arriving in a $2$-hour window, $X$, is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = 6$. We denote this as $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(6)$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ with mean $\\mu$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu) \\mu^k}{k!}\n$$\nfor non-negative integers $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe commitment threshold is crossed if at least $5$ FT pulses arrive within the window. We are therefore required to calculate the probability $P(X \\ge 5)$. It is computationally more efficient to calculate the probability of the complement event, $P(X < 5)$, and subtract this from $1$. The complement event corresponds to the number of pulses being less than $5$.\n$$\nP(X \\ge 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(X=k)\n$$\nSubstituting the PMF of the Poisson distribution with $\\mu=6$:\n$$\nP(X \\ge 5) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\frac{\\exp(-6) 6^k}{k!}\n$$\nWe can factor out the $\\exp(-6)$ term:\n$$\nP(X \\ge 5) = 1 - \\exp(-6) \\left( \\frac{6^0}{0!} + \\frac{6^1}{1!} + \\frac{6^2}{2!} + \\frac{6^3}{3!} + \\frac{6^4}{4!} \\right)\n$$\nWe now evaluate each term in the sum.
