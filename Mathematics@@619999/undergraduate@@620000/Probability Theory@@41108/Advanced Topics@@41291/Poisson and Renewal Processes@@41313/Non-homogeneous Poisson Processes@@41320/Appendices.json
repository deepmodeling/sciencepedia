The number of events happening by a certain time, $N(t)$, and the waiting time for the $k$-th event, $S_k$, are two sides of the same coin. This exercise [@problem_id:1377398] challenges you to connect these two perspectives by calculating the probability that a specific event count is reached only after a designated time, a common requirement in planning and resource allocation. At its core, this problem reinforces the essential skill of calculating the mean measure, $\\Lambda(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\lambda(t) dt$, and using it within the Poisson probability framework.", "problem": "An astronomical observatory is monitoring a meteor shower. The detection of meteors is modeled as a point process in time. Due to the shower's dynamics, the instantaneous rate of meteor detection, $\\lambda(t)$, is not constant but increases linearly with time.

A separate, critical observation of a distant galaxy is scheduled to run from $t=0$ to $t=T$.
