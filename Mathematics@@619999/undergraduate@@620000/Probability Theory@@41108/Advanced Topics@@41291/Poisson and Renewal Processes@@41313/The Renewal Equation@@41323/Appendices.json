The time of the first renewal is the duration of the first full cycle, $Z_1 = X_1 + Y_1$.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the random variable representing the number of repairs completed by time $t$.

This would be correct if the renewal events were the failures, not the completed repairs.\n-   Option C has $M(x)$ instead of $M(t-x)$ in the integrand.

This would imply that a renewal is guaranteed to happen eventually, but the `1` is only counted if the renewal happens *before* time $t$, which is why it must be integrated and results in $F_Z(t)$.\n-   Option E uses the distribution of the repair time $Y_i$.
