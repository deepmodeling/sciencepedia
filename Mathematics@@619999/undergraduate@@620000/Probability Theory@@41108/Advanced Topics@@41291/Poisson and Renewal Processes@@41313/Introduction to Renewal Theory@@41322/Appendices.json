Let $X_1, X_2, \\dots$ be the sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) positive random variables representing the times between consecutive events. These are called inter-arrival times. The total number of events that have occurred by time $t$ is denoted by $N(t)$. The renewal function, $m(t)$, is defined as the expected number of events by time $t$, i.e., $m(t) = E[N(t)]$.\n\nA fundamental relationship in renewal theory is the integral renewal equation, which connects the renewal function $m(t)$ to the cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(t)$, of the inter-arrival times:\n$$m(t) = F(t) + \\int_0^t m(t-x) f(x) \\,dx$$\nwhere $f(x) = F'(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the inter-arrival times.\n\nConsider a special case of a renewal process known as a Poisson process. In a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda > 0$, the inter-arrival times $X_i$ follow an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nUsing the provided integral renewal equation, determine the analytical expression for the renewal function $m(t)$ for a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$.", "solution": "We start from the integral renewal equation for the renewal function $m(t)$:\n$$\nm(t) = F(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} m(t-x) f(x)\\,dx,\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the CDF and $f$ is the PDF of the inter-arrival time distribution.

Denote by $M(s)$, $F^*(s)$, and $f^*(s)$ the Laplace transforms of $m(t)$, $F(t)$, and $f(t)$, respectively. Using the convolution property, the transform of the integral term is $M(s) f^*(s)$. Thus,\n$$\nM(s) = F^*(s) + M(s) f^*(s) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad M(s)\\bigl(1 - f^*(s)\\bigr) = F^*(s).\n$$\nCompute the transforms for the exponential case:\n$$\nf^*(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda \\exp\\bigl(-(s+\\lambda)t\\bigr)\\,dt = \\frac{\\lambda}{s+\\lambda},\n$$\n$$\nF^*(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\bigl(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)\\bigr)\\exp(-s t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda}{s(s+\\lambda)}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n1 - f^*(s) = 1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{s+\\lambda} = \\frac{s}{s+\\lambda},\n$$\nand\n$$\nM(s) = \\frac{F^*(s)}{1 - f^*(s)} = \\frac{\\lambda}{s(s+\\lambda)} \\cdot \\frac{s+\\lambda}{s} = \\frac{\\lambda}{s^2}.\n$$\nInvert the Laplace transform using $\\mathcal{L}\\{t\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2}$ to obtain\n$$\nm(t) = \\lambda t.\n$$\nThis satisfies the renewal equation and matches the known expectation $E[N(t)] = \\lambda t$ for a Poisson process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda t}$$", "id": "1310783"}, {"introduction": "A key application of renewal theory is understanding the long-term behavior of systems.

The duration of the green phase is a fixed constant $t_g$, and the duration of the yellow phase is a fixed constant $t_y$.\n\nTo improve traffic flow, the duration of the red phase is adaptive. After the yellow light ends, the system waits for a suitable gap in the cross-traffic before switching to green. This waiting time, which constitutes the red phase duration, is a random variable.
