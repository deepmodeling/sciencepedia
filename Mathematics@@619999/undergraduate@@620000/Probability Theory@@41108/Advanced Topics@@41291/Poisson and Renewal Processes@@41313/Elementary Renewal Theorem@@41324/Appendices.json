By modeling tire replacements as a renewal process, we can estimate the long-term average number of components needed over a substantial operational period. This practice demonstrates how the theorem simplifies complex long-run predictions into a straightforward calculation based on the mean lifetime of the components [@problem_id:1293701].", "problem": "A logistics company operates a fleet of heavy-duty transport trucks. Each truck is equipped with 2 front tires and 4 rear tires. When a tire fails, it is immediately replaced with a new one of the same type. The lifetime of a front tire, measured in miles traveled, is a random variable with an expected value of 50,000 miles. The lifetime of a rear tire is also a random variable, with an expected value of 80,000 miles. All tire lifetimes are independent of each other.\n\nA single truck begins a long-haul journey of 2,000,000 miles with a brand new set of all 6 tires. Calculate the expected total number of replacement tires (both front and rear combined) that will be needed for this truck to complete the journey.", "solution": "This problem can be modeled using renewal theory. For each tire position on the truck, the sequence of tire failures and replacements constitutes a renewal process. The \"time\" in this context is the distance traveled in miles. We need to find the expected number of renewals (replacements) over a total distance of $D = 2,000,000$ miles.\n\nLet's denote the number of front tires by $n_F = 2$ and the number of rear tires by $n_R = 4$.\nThe mean lifetime of a front tire is $\\mu_F = 50,000$ miles.\nThe mean lifetime of a rear tire is $\\mu_R = 80,000$ miles.\nThe total distance of the journey is $D = 2,000,000$ miles.\n\nWe can analyze the front and rear tires separately and then sum their expected replacements.\n\nFirst, consider the front tires.\nFor a single front tire position, the sequence of replacements is a renewal process with mean inter-arrival time (lifetime) $\\mu_F$. Let $N_F(D)$ be the number of replacements for one front tire position over the distance $D$. The Elementary Renewal Theorem states that for a renewal process with mean inter-arrival time $\\mu$, the long-run average rate of renewals is $1/\\mu$. For a large time interval $t$, the expected number of renewals is approximately $E[N(t)] \\approx \\frac{t}{\\mu}$.\nSince the journey distance $D$ is much larger than the mean tire lifetime $\\mu_F$, we can use this approximation to estimate the expected number of replacements for one front tire position:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one front tire}] \\approx \\frac{D}{\\mu_F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one front tire}] = \\frac{2,000,000 \\text{ miles}}{50,000 \\text{ miles}} = 40$$\nSince there are $n_F = 2$ front tires, and the lifetimes are independent, the total expected number of front tire replacements is the sum of the expected replacements for each position. By linearity of expectation:\n$$E[\\text{total front replacements}] = n_F \\times E[\\text{replacements for one front tire}] = 2 \\times 40 = 80$$\n\nNext, we follow the same logic for the rear tires.\nFor a single rear tire position, the mean lifetime is $\\mu_R = 80,000$ miles.\nThe expected number of replacements for one rear tire position over the distance $D$ is:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one rear tire}] \\approx \\frac{D}{\\mu_R}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one rear tire}] = \\frac{2,000,000 \\text{ miles}}{80,000 \\text{ miles}} = 25$$\nThere are $n_R = 4$ rear tires. The total expected number of rear tire replacements is:\n$$E[\\text{total rear replacements}] = n_R \\times E[\\text{replacements for one rear tire}] = 4 \\times 25 = 100$$\n\nFinally, the total expected number of replacement tires for the entire truck is the sum of the expected replacements for the front and rear tires:\n$$E[\\text{total replacements}] = E[\\text{total front replacements}] + E[\\text{total rear replacements}]$$\n$$E[\\text{total replacements}] = 80 + 100 = 180$$\n\nSo, the expected total number of replacement tires needed for the journey is 180.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{180}$$", "id": "1293701"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic application, this problem explores system reliability where the failure of any single component leads to the replacement of the entire system. Before applying the Elementary Renewal Theorem, you must first calculate the expected lifetime of the whole module, which is the minimum of its individual component lifetimes. This exercise highlights how renewal theory is used to analyze the long-run behavior of multi-component systems and is a key concept in reliability engineering [@problem_id:1359949].", "problem": "A satellite's primary communication module relies on two different, essential microprocessors, which we will call Component A and Component B. The operational lifetime of each component is modeled as a random variable. The lifetime of Component A is an exponentially distributed random variable with a mean of $T_A = 5.0$ years. The lifetime of Component B is also an exponentially distributed random variable, with a mean of $T_B = 8.0$ years. The lifetimes of the two components are statistically independent.\n\nThe entire communication module is considered to have failed as soon as either one of its two components fails. Upon failure, a ground command immediately and instantaneously triggers a replacement of the entire module with an identical new one. This cycle of operation, failure, and replacement repeats indefinitely.\n\nAssuming the satellite operates for a very long period, determine the long-run average number of module replacements per year. Express your final answer as a number rounded to three significant figures, in units of replacements per year.", "solution": "Let $R(t)$ be the number of module replacements that have occurred up to time $t$. The problem asks for the long-run average rate of replacements, which can be expressed as the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{E[R(t)]}{t}$. Note that the problem should ask for the limit of $\\frac{E[R(t)]}{t}$, not $\\frac{R(t)}{t}$.\n\nThe sequence of module replacements forms a renewal process. The time between consecutive replacements is the lifetime of a single module. Let $Z_i$ be the lifetime of the $i$-th module. Since each module is identical and new upon replacement, the lifetimes $Z_1, Z_2, Z_3, \\dots$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.\n\nThe Elementary Renewal Theorem states that for a renewal process with i.i.d. inter-arrival times $Z_i$ having a finite mean $\\mu = E[Z_i]$, the long-run rate of renewals is given by:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{E[R(t)]}{t} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{E[Z]} $$\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the expected lifetime of a single module, $E[Z]$.\n\nLet $X$ be the lifetime of Component A and $Y$ be the lifetime of Component B within a single module. The problem states that these are independent, exponentially distributed random variables.\nThe lifetime of Component A, $X$, has a mean $E[X] = T_A = 5.0$ years. For an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda_A$, the mean is $1/\\lambda_A$. Thus, the rate for Component A is $\\lambda_A = 1/T_A = 1/5.0 \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\nThe lifetime of Component B, $Y$, has a mean $E[Y] = T_B = 8.0$ years. Similarly, its rate parameter is $\\lambda_B = 1/T_B = 1/8.0 \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n\nThe module fails as soon as either component fails. Therefore, the lifetime of the module, $Z$, is the minimum of the lifetimes of its two components:\n$$ Z = \\min(X, Y) $$\nWe need to find the expected value of $Z$, $E[\\min(X, Y)]$. We can determine the distribution of $Z$.\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $Z$ is $F_Z(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. It is easier to first find the survival function, $S_Z(z) = P(Z > z)$.\n$$ P(Z > z) = P(\\min(X, Y) > z) $$\nThe event $\\min(X, Y) > z$ is equivalent to the event that both $X > z$ and $Y > z$.\n$$ P(Z > z) = P(X > z \\text{ and } Y > z) $$\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, we can write:\n$$ P(Z > z) = P(X > z) P(Y > z) $$\nFor an exponentially distributed random variable with rate $\\lambda$, the survival function is $P(\\text{lifetime} > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\nSo, for our components:\n- $P(X > z) = \\exp(-\\lambda_A z)$\n- $P(Y > z) = \\exp(-\\lambda_B z)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(Z > z)$:\n$$ P(Z > z) = \\exp(-\\lambda_A z) \\exp(-\\lambda_B z) = \\exp(-(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B)z) $$\nThis is the survival function of an exponential distribution with a rate parameter equal to $\\lambda_Z = \\lambda_A + \\lambda_B$. Therefore, the module lifetime $Z$ is exponentially distributed with rate $\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B$.\n\nThe expected value of an exponentially distributed random variable with rate $\\lambda_Z$ is $1/\\lambda_Z$. So, the mean lifetime of the module is:\n$$ \\mu = E[Z] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B} $$\nNow, we can apply the Elementary Renewal Theorem. The long-run rate of replacements is:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{1/(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B)} = \\lambda_A + \\lambda_B $$\nNow we substitute the numerical values for the rates:\n$$ \\lambda_A = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\text{ years}} = 0.20 \\text{ year}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\lambda_B = \\frac{1}{8.0 \\text{ years}} = 0.125 \\text{ year}^{-1} $$\nThe long-run rate of replacements is:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = 0.20 + 0.125 = 0.325 \\text{ year}^{-1} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $0.325$ has three significant figures (the digits 3, 2, and 5). Thus, no further rounding is needed.
