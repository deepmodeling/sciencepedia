The total rate of any state change (a \"jump\") is $\\lambda_{total} = \\lambda_U + \\lambda_D$. The question of which boundary is hit first depends only on the probabilities of an upward jump versus a downward jump, not on the timing of the jumps. We can therefore analyze an equivalent discrete-time random walk where at each step, the state changes by either $+1$ or $-1$.\n\nThe probability that a given jump is an upward one (charge increases by 1) is given by the ratio of the upward rate to the total rate:\n$$ p = P(\\text{jump is +1}) = \\frac{\\lambda_U}{\\lambda_U + \\lambda_D} $$\nThe probability that a given jump is a downward one (charge decreases by 1) is:\n$$ q = P(\\text{jump is -1}) = \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_U + \\lambda_D} $$\nWe have $p+q=1$.\n\nThis frames the problem as a classic gambler's ruin problem.
