Also, there is a 2-step return via $S_{3}$: $S_{1}\\to S_{3}\\to S_{1}$ with probability $(1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)>0$.\n\nMore generally, starting from $S_{1}$, take $S_{1}\\to S_{3}$ (probability $1-\\alpha>0$), then loop $m\\ge 0$ times through $S_{3}\\to S_{4}\\to S_{3}$ (each loop has length $2$ and occurs with probability $\\beta\\cdot 1$), and finally take $S_{3}\\to S_{1}$ (probability $1-\\beta>0$). This yields a return in $2m+2$ steps with probability $(1-\\alpha)\\beta^{m}(1-\\beta)>0$. Hence $p_{11}^{(2m+2)}>0$ for all integers $m\\ge 0$, so every even $n\\ge 2$ is a return time.\n\nNo odd return times are possible. Indeed, the state space is bipartitioned as $\\{S_{1},S_{4}\\}$ and $\\{S_{2},S_{3}\\}$: from $S_{1}$ one moves to $\\{S_{2},S_{3}\\}$ in one step, and transitions alternate between these two sets each step.
