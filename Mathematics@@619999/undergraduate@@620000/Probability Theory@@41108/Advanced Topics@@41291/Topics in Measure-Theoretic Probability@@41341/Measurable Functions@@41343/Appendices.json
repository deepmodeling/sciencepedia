The collection of open intervals of the form $(a, \\infty)$ for all $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a generator for the Borel sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, a function $f$ is measurable if $f^{-1}((a, \\infty)) \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ for every $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConsider the linear function $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are real constants and $m > 0$.
