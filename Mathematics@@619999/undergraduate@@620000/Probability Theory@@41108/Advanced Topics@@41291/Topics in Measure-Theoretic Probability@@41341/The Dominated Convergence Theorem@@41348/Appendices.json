Experimental results indicate that for any given particle, its decay constant $\\lambda$ is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution over the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nFor a particle with a fixed decay constant $\\lambda$, the probability that it survives for a time duration $t$ is given by the formula $S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\n\nTo analyze this system, a physicist considers a discrete-time approximation scheme. In this scheme, a total time interval of one unit is divided into $n$ smaller, equal subintervals, each of duration $1/n$. The model assumes that within any single subinterval, a particle with decay constant $\\lambda$ has a probability of decay equal to $\\lambda/n$. Consequently, the probability of survival through one subinterval is $(1 - \\lambda/n)$.\n\nLet $Y_n$ be the random variable representing the survival probability of a particle over the entire one-unit time interval, as calculated using this $n$-step discrete model. Your task is to determine the limiting value of the average survival probability as the discretization becomes infinitely fine.\n\nCalculate the exact value of $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} E[Y_n]$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the limit of the expected value of the random variable $Y_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The random variable $\\lambda$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, which we denote as $\\lambda \\sim U[0, 1]$. Its probability density function (PDF) is $f_{\\lambda}(x) = 1$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$ and $f_{\\lambda}(x) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nFirst, let's express the random variable $Y_n$ as a function of $\\lambda$. According to the discrete model, the survival probability over one unit of time, divided into $n$ subintervals, is the product of the survival probabilities in each subinterval. Since the survival probability in each subinterval of length $1/n$ is $(1 - \\lambda/n)$, the total survival probability over the $n$ intervals is:\n$$ Y_n = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^n $$\nThe quantity we need to compute is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} E[Y_n]$. The expectation of $Y_n$ is given by integrating the product of $Y_n(\\lambda)$ and the PDF of $\\lambda$ over its support:\n$$ E[Y_n] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n f_{\\lambda}(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n \\cdot 1 \\, dx $$\nSo, we need to evaluate:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n \\, dx $$\nWe can solve this by swapping the limit and the integral. The Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) provides the conditions under which this operation is valid. Let $g_n(x) = (1 - x/n)^n$. The DCT states that if $g_n(x)$ converges pointwise to a function $g(x)$ for almost every $x$ in the domain of integration, and if there exists an integrable function $H(x)$ such that $|g_n(x)| \\le H(x)$ for all $n$ and for almost every $x$, then $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int g_n(x) \\, dx = \\int \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g_n(x) \\, dx = \\int g(x) \\, dx$.\n\nLet's check the conditions of the DCT for our problem.\n\n1.  **Pointwise Convergence:** For any fixed $x \\in [0, 1]$, we find the limit of $g_n(x)$ as $n \\to \\infty$:\n    $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g_n(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n $$\n    This is a standard limit form which evaluates to an exponential function:\n    $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{-x}{n}\\right)^n = \\exp(-x) $$\n    So, the sequence of functions $g_n(x)$ converges pointwise to $g(x) = \\exp(-x)$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n2.  **Dominating Function:** We need to find an integrable function $H(x)$ on $[0, 1]$ such that $|g_n(x)| \\le H(x)$ for all $n$.\n    For $x \\in [0, 1]$ and any integer $n \\ge 1$, we have $0 \\le x/n \\le 1$.\n    This implies $0 \\le 1 - x/n \\le 1$.\n    Raising this to the power of $n$, we get:\n    $$ 0 \\le \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n \\le 1^n = 1 $$\n    Since $g_n(x) = (1 - x/n)^n$ is always non-negative on this interval, we have $|g_n(x)| = g_n(x) \\le 1$.\n    We can choose the constant function $H(x) = 1$ as our dominating function.\n\n3.  **Integrability of the Dominating Function:** We check if $H(x)$ is integrable over $[0, 1]$.\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{1} H(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, dx = [x]_{0}^{1} = 1 - 0 = 1 $$\n    Since the integral is finite ($1 < \\infty$), the dominating function $H(x) = 1$ is integrable on $[0, 1]$.\n\nSince all conditions of the Dominated Convergence Theorem are satisfied, we can interchange the limit and the integral:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} E[Y_n] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n \\, dx $$\nUsing the pointwise limit we found in the first step:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} E[Y_n] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\exp(-x) \\, dx $$\nNow we just need to evaluate this definite integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} \\exp(-x) \\, dx = [-\\exp(-x)]_{0}^{1} = (-\\exp(-1)) - (-\\exp(-0)) = -\\exp(-1) + \\exp(0) = - \\frac{1}{e} + 1 $$\nThus, the limiting value of the expected survival probability is $1 - 1/e$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\frac{1}{e}}$$", "id": "1397181"}, {"introduction": "While many introductory examples use straightforward dominating functions, real-world analysis often demands more ingenuity.
