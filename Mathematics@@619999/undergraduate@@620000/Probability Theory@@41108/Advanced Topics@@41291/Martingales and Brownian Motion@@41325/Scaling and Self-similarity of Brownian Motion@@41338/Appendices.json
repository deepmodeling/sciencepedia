The standard model for the logarithm of the stock price is often represented by a process involving a standard Brownian motion. Let $B_t$ denote a standard Brownian motion, where $t$ is time measured in days. A key characteristic of a standard Brownian motion is that its value at time $t > 0$, $B_t$, is a random variable with a mean of 0 and a variance equal to $t$.\n\nThe analyst proposes a new model, $X_t$, to capture the behavior of a more volatile, related asset. This new model is constructed by scaling the standard Brownian motion both in time and in amplitude:\n$$X_t = c B_{\\alpha t}$$\nwhere $c$ and $\\alpha$ are positive real constants. The parameter $\\alpha$ reflects how much faster the underlying random fluctuations occur compared to the standard model, while $c$ scales the magnitude of these fluctuations.\n\nFor the asset under consideration, the analyst determines that the appropriate time-scaling factor is $\\alpha = 36$. The analyst's goal is to calibrate the model $X_t = c B_{36t}$ so that the statistical uncertainty, as measured by variance, of the asset's log-price at time $t=1$ day is the same as the variance of the standard model's log-price at time $t=4$ days.\n\nDetermine the exact value of the positive constant $c$ that achieves this calibration.", "solution": "For a standard Brownian motion $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$, the distribution at time $t$ satisfies $\\mathbb{E}[B_{t}]=0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(B_{t})=t$.
