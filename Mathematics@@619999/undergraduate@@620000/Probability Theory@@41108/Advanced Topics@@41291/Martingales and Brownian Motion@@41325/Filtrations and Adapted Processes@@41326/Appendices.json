For a discrete random variable like $M_n$, this condition simplifies: for every possible value $k$ that $M_n$ can take, the event $\\{M_n = k\\}$ must be an event in $\\mathcal{G}_n$.\n\nLet's analyze the filtration $\\mathcal{G}_n$. By definition, $\\mathcal{G}_n = \\sigma(S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n)$. This means that the events in $\\mathcal{G}_n$ are all the possible events that can be described using the information contained in the sequence of signals $(S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n)$. For a given $n$, the information available to the analyst is the specific sequence of 0s and 1s that have been observed up to that time.\n\nLet's test the measurability condition for $M_n$. Consider a specific time, say $n=1$, for simplicity. The filtration is $\\mathcal{G}_1 = \\sigma(S_1)$. The possible values for $S_1$ are 0 and 1. The non-trivial events in $\\mathcal{G}_1$ are therefore $\\{S_1=0\\}$ and $\\{S_1=1\\}$.\nThe event $\\{S_1=0\\}$ is equivalent to the event $\\{M_1 \\in \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\}$.\nThe event $\\{S_1=1\\}$ is equivalent to the event $\\{M_1 \\in \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\}$.\nThe sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is thus given by $\\mathcal{G}_1 = \\{\\emptyset, \\{M_1 \\in \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\}, \\{M_1 \\in \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\}, \\Omega\\}$, where $\\Omega$ is the entire sample space.\n\nNow, we check if $M_1$ is $\\mathcal{G}_1$-measurable. For $M_1$ to be $\\mathcal{G}_1$-measurable, for any value $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, the event $\\{M_1 = k\\}$ must be in $\\mathcal{G}_1$.\n\nLet's pick $k=2$. The event is $\\{M_1 = 2\\}$. Is this event in $\\mathcal{G}_1$? The events in $\\mathcal{G}_1$ are the empty set, the whole space, the event that $M_1$ is even, and the event that $M_1$ is odd. Clearly, $\\{M_1=2\\}$ is not any of these. For example, $\\{M_1 = 2\\}$ is a proper subset of $\\{M_1 \\in \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\}$. From the information available in $\\mathcal{G}_1$ (i.e., knowing if $M_1$ is even or odd), we cannot distinguish the outcome $M_1=2$ from the outcome $M_1=4$ or $M_1=6$. If the analyst receives the signal $S_1=0$, they know that $M_1$ is one of $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$, but they cannot determine its specific value.\n\nSince the event $\\{M_1 = 2\\}$ is not in $\\mathcal{G}_1$, the random variable $M_1$ is not $\\mathcal{G}_1$-measurable. This holds for any $n$; the event $\\{M_n=k\\}$ for any specific $k$ is not in $\\mathcal{G}_n$. Since the condition for adaptedness fails for $n=1$ (and indeed for all $n$), the process $\\{M_n\\}_{n \\ge 1}$ is not adapted to the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{G}_n\\}_{n \\ge 1}$.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. While $\\mathcal{G}_n$ is derived from $\\{M_n\\}$, it is a \"coarser\" filtration that contains less information. A process is adapted to a filtration, not the other way around. The fact that the filtration is derived from the process does not guarantee adaptedness unless the filtration retains all the necessary information.\nB. This is incorrect. Independence and being identically distributed are properties of the probability distribution of the process, but they are distinct from the concept of adaptedness, which relates the process to a flow of information.\nC. This is incorrect. The filtration $\\mathcal{G}_n$ does contain some information about $M_n$—namely, its parity. It's not that there is no information, but that the information is incomplete.\nD. This is correct. As demonstrated, knowing the full history of signals $S_1, \\ldots, S_n$ is not enough to determine the exact value of $M_n$. Knowing $S_n$ only tells you if $M_n$ is in the set $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$ or $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$, it does not pinpoint the value. Therefore, $M_n$ is not $\\mathcal{G}_n$-measurable.\nE. This is incorrect. The definition of $\\mathcal{G}_n$ is $\\sigma(S_1, \\ldots, S_n)$, which explicitly includes the information from time $n$.
