It is impossible to determine independence from the joint MGF alone.", "solution": "The central principle for determining the independence of two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, from their joint Moment Generating Function (MGF) is the factorization theorem. This theorem states that $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if their joint MGF, $M_{X,Y}(t_1, t_2)$, can be factored into the product of their individual (marginal) MGFs, $M_X(t_1)$ and $M_Y(t_2)$.

Since the joint MGF is of the form $\\exp(P(t_1, t_2))$, this is equivalent to checking if the exponent, $P(t_1, t_2)$, can be separated into the sum of a function of only $t_1$ and a function of only $t_2$.\n\nLet's examine the exponent:\n$$P(t_1, t_2) = 5t_1 + 2t_2 + 8t_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}t_2^2 + 4t_1t_2$$\n\nWe can try to rearrange the terms to see if separation is possible:\n$$P(t_1, t_2) = (5t_1 + 8t_1^2) + \\left(2t_2 + \\frac{1}{2}t_2^2\\right) + 4t_1t_2$$\n\nLet the hypothetical separated functions be $g(t_1) = 5t_1 + 8t_1^2$ and $h(t_2) = 2t_2 + \\frac{1}{2}t_2^2$. The exponent can be written as:\n$$P(t_1, t_2) = g(t_1) + h(t_2) + 4t_1t_2$$\n\nThe term $4t_1t_2$ is a \"cross-product\" term because it involves both $t_1$ and $t_2$. This term cannot be separated into a sum of a function of $t_1$ and a function of $t_2$. Because of the presence of this term, the exponent $P(t_1, t_2)$ cannot be written in the form $g(t_1) + h(t_2)$.\n\nConsequently, the joint MGF cannot be factored into the product of two functions, one depending only on $t_1$ and the other only on $t_2$:\n$$M_{X,Y}(t_1, t_2) = \\exp(g(t_1) + h(t_2) + 4t_1t_2) = \\exp(g(t_1)) \\exp(h(t_2)) \\exp(4t_1t_2) \\neq M_X(t_1)M_Y(t_2)$$\n\nSince the joint MGF does not factor into the product of the marginal MGFs, the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are not independent. The reason for the failure of factorization is the presence of the cross-product term $4t_1t_2$ in the exponent.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. The form of the function (exponential) is not sufficient to determine independence. This is incorrect.\nB. The means of the variables being non-zero has no bearing on their independence. This is incorrect.\nC. The presence of the cross-product term $4t_1t_2$ prevents the MGF from being factorable, which implies that the variables are not independent. This is the correct reasoning.\nD. The existence of the MGF is a necessary prerequisite, but it does not guarantee independence. This is incorrect.\nE.
