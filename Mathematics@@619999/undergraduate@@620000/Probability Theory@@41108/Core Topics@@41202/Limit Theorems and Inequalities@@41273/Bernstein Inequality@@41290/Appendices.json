We can express this in terms of the deviation from the mean:\n$$ P(S_N > 11000) = P(S_N - E[S_N] > 11000 - 10000) = P(S_N - 10000 > 1000) $$\nLet $t=1000$. We are looking for an upper bound on $P(S_N - E[S_N] > t)$.\n\nWe are given that the random variables $X_i$ are bounded, as they take values in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 50\\}$. This suggests that a concentration inequality which leverages this boundedness, in addition to the variance, would be most effective.

The bound $M$: Since $X_i \\in [0, 50]$, the centered variable $Y_i = X_i - 20$ is in the range $[0-20, 50-20] = [-20, 30]$. The absolute value is bounded by $|Y_i| \\le \\max(|-20|, |30|) = 30$.
