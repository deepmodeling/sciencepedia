This first exercise provides a classic scenario from logistics where we apply the CLT to a sum of continuous random variables.

The weight of any given package is a random variable, independent of the others, and is known to be uniformly distributed between 5.00 kg and 35.00 kg.

The packet consists of $N = 22,500$ bits.

This algorithm can successfully reconstruct the original message if the total number of flipped bits in the packet does not exceed 495. If the number of flipped bits is greater than 495, the entire packet is deemed corrupted and must be re-transmitted.\n\nAssuming that the bit-flip events are independent, what is the probability that the data packet is successfully reconstructed on the first attempt?

A team’s season-end win fraction is reported as $0.550$ (three significant digits).

The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical hypothesis testing.\n\nWe are given a sequence of Bernoulli trials, where the outcome of each game is a win (success) or a loss (failure). The true probability of success is $p$. A season consists of $N$ such trials. The observed sample proportion of wins is given as $\\hat{p} = 0.550$.\n\nThe statistical test is defined by a null hypothesis, $H_{0}$, and an alternative hypothesis, $H_{1}$.\nThe null hypothesis states that the team's performance is equivalent to random chance:\n$$H_{0}: p = p_{0} = 0.500$$\nThe one-sided alternative hypothesis posits that the team's performance is better than random chance:\n$$H_{1}: p > 0.500$$\n\nThe problem states that the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) justifies the use of a normal approximation for the sampling distribution of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The formula for the $Z$ test statistic for a single proportion is:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_{0}}{\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}}$$\nwhere $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion, $p_{0}$ is the proportion under the null hypothesis, and $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$ is the standard error of the sample proportion under the null hypothesis. The standard error is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_{0}(1 - p_{0})}{N}}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the $Z$ statistic formula, we have:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{0}(1 - p_{0})}{N}}}$$\n\nA result is declared \"statistically significant\" if the null hypothesis is rejected. For the given one-sided alternative hypothesis $H_{1}: p > 0.500$ and a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, we reject $H_{0}$ if the calculated $Z$ statistic is greater than the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha} = z_{0.95}$. The problem provides this critical value as $z_{0.95} = 1.64485$.\n\nTherefore, the condition for statistical significance is:\n$$Z > 1.64485$$\n\nWe must find the minimum integer $N$ that satisfies this inequality. We substitute the given values into the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{0.550 - 0.500}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.500(1 - 0.500)}{N}}} > 1.64485 $$\n\nFirst, simplify the numerator and the expression inside the square root:\nThe numerator is $\\Delta p = 0.550 - 0.500 = 0.050$.\nThe term $p_{0}(1 - p_{0})$ is $0.500 \\times (1 - 0.500) = 0.500 \\times 0.500 = 0.25$.\n\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$ \\frac{0.050}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.25}{N}}} > 1.64485 $$\n\nThe denominator can be rewritten as $\\frac{\\sqrt{0.25}}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{N}}$. Substituting this back into the inequality gives:\n$$ \\frac{0.050}{\\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{N}}} > 1.64485 $$\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{0.050 \\sqrt{N}}{0.5} > 1.64485 $$\n$$ 0.1 \\sqrt{N} > 1.64485 $$\n\nNow, we solve for $N$. First, isolate $\\sqrt{N}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{N} > \\frac{1.64485}{0.1} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{N} > 16.4485 $$\n\nTo find $N$, we square both sides of the inequality:\n$$ N > (16.4485)^{2} $$\n$$ N > 270.55285225 $$\n\nSince the season length $N$ must be an integer number of games, we must find the smallest integer value of $N$ that satisfies this condition. The smallest integer strictly greater than $270.55285225$ is $271$.\n\nThus, a season must have a minimum length of $N = 271$ games for an observed win fraction of $0.550$ to be considered statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis of $p=0.500$ at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ significance level.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{271}$$", "id": "2432414"}]}
