For a random variable $X$ with a finite mean $\\mu$ and a finite non-zero variance $\\sigma^2$, and for any real number $\\epsilon > 0$, the inequality states:\n$$P(|X - \\mu| \\ge \\epsilon) \\le \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\epsilon^2}$$\nThe inequality also holds for the case where $\\sigma^2=0$. Option E claims the inequality is not applicable, but this is incorrect; the conditions of finite mean and variance are met.\n\nWe are interested in the probability $P(X \\neq \\mu)$. The condition $X \\neq \\mu$ is equivalent to the condition $|X - \\mu| > 0$.\nThe event $|X - \\mu| > 0$ can be expressed as a countable union of nested events. Let's consider a sequence of positive numbers that approaches zero, for example, $\\epsilon_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The event that $|X - \\mu|$ is strictly greater than zero is the same as the event that there exists some integer $n$ for which $|X - \\mu| \\ge \\frac{1}{n}$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$ \\{X \\neq \\mu\\} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\{ |X - \\mu| \\ge \\frac{1}{n} \\right\\} $$\n\nNow, let's apply Chebyshev's inequality to each event in this union. For any specific $n$, we can set $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{n}$. We are given that the variance $\\sigma^2 = 0$.\nApplying the inequality gives:\n$$ P\\left(|X - \\mu| \\ge \\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\le \\frac{\\sigma^2}{(1/n)^2} = \\frac{0}{(1/n)^2} = 0 $$\nSince probability must be non-negative, this inequality implies that for every positive integer $n$:\n$$ P\\left(|X - \\mu| \\ge \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = 0 $$\n\nNow we can determine the probability of the union. Using the property of continuity of probability for an increasing sequence of events, we have:\n$$ P(X \\neq \\mu) = P\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\{ |X - \\mu| \\ge \\frac{1}{n} \\right\\}\\right) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} P\\left(|X - \\mu| \\ge \\frac{1}{n}\\right) $$\nSince each term in the limit is 0, the result is:\n$$ P(X \\neq \\mu) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0 $$\nAlternatively, we can use Boole's inequality (the union bound), which states that for any countable set of events $A_n$, $P(\\cup A_n) \\le \\sum P(A_n)$.\n$$ P(X \\neq \\mu) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P\\left(|X - \\mu| \\ge \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 0 = 0 $$\nAgain, since probability is non-negative, this forces $P(X \\neq \\mu) = 0$.\n\nChebyshev's inequality has led us to the conclusion that the probability $P(X \\neq \\mu)$ is at most 0.
