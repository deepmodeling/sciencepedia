We want to calculate the probability $P(D \\ge 150)$. Since $n$ is large, we can approximate the distribution of $D$ by a normal distribution. To do so, we first need to find the mean (expected value) and variance of $D$.\n\nThe expected value of $D$ is:\n$$E[D] = E[N_A - N_B] = E[N_A] - E[N_B]$$\nThe marginal distributions of $N_A$ and $N_B$ are binomial.
