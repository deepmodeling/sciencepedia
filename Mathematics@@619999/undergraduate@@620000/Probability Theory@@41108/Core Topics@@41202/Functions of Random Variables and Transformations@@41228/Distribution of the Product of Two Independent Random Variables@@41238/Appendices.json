The processing unit computes an output signal, $Z$, defined as the product of the two input signals, $Z = XY$.\n\nYour task is to determine the complete probability mass function for the output signal $Z$. Calculate the probabilities $P(Z = -1)$, $P(Z = 0)$, and $P(Z = 1)$. Present your answer as a set of three exact fractions for the tuple of probabilities $(P(Z = -1), P(Z = 0), P(Z = 1))$, in this specific order.", "solution": "Let the two independent random variables representing the input signals be $X$ and $Y$. The set of possible values (the support) for both $X$ and $Y$ is $S = \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that each value in the set is chosen with equal probability. Since there are 3 possible values, the probability mass function (PMF) for both $X$ and $Y$ is:\n$P(X = k) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for $k \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$\n$P(Y = j) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for $j \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$\n\nThe output signal is the random variable $Z = XY$. The possible values for $Z$ are the products of the possible values of $X$ and $Y$. Let's list them:\n$(-1) \\times (-1) = 1$\n$(-1) \\times 0 = 0$\n$(-1) \\times 1 = -1$\n$0 \\times (-1) = 0$\n$0 \\times 0 = 0$\n$0 \\times 1 = 0$\n$1 \\times (-1) = -1$\n$1 \\times 0 = 0$\n$1 \\times 1 = 1$\n\nThe support of the random variable $Z$ is also the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. We need to find the probability of each of these outcomes.\n\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the probability of any specific pair of outcomes $(X=k, Y=j)$ is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$P(X=k, Y=j) = P(X=k) \\times P(Y=j) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ for any $k, j \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThere are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ equally likely pairs of $(X,Y)$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the PMF of $Z$ by summing the probabilities of the pairs $(k, j)$ that result in each value of $Z$.\n\n**Case 1: Calculate $P(Z = -1)$**\nThe product $XY = -1$ occurs for the following pairs $(X, Y)$:\n1.  $X = -1$ and $Y = 1$\n2.  $X = 1$ and $Y = -1$\nThere are two such pairs.

The probability is:\n$P(Z = 1) = P(X=-1, Y=-1) + P(X=1, Y=1) = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n**Case 3: Calculate $P(Z = 0)$**\nThe product $XY = 0$ occurs if either $X=0$ or $Y=0$ (or both). The pairs $(X, Y)$ are:\n1.  $X = -1$ and $Y = 0$\n2.  $X = 0$ and $Y = -1$\n3.  $X = 0$ and $Y = 0$\n4.  $X = 0$ and $Y = 1$\n5.  $X = 1$ and $Y = 0$\nThere are five such pairs.
