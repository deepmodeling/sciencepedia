This first exercise explores a foundational consequence of combining such processes, specifically how the variability of the total count relates to the variability of its components.

A Geiger-Müller counter is used to monitor the radiation.\n\nThe first source emits alpha particles. The detection of these alpha particles by the counter can be modeled as a random process where the events occur at a constant average rate of $\\lambda_1$ particles per minute, and the number of particles detected in any time interval is independent of the number detected in any other disjoint time interval.\n\nThe second source, placed nearby, emits beta particles. This emission is an independent random process. The detection of these beta particles occurs at a constant average rate of $\\lambda_2$ particles per minute, with the same properties of independence over disjoint time intervals.\n\nLet the total number of particles (both alpha and beta) detected by the counter in a single one-minute interval be $N$. Assuming the detection processes for alpha and beta particles are independent of each other, find a symbolic expression for the variance of $N$.", "solution": "Let $X_1$ be the random variable representing the number of alpha particles detected in a one-minute interval.
