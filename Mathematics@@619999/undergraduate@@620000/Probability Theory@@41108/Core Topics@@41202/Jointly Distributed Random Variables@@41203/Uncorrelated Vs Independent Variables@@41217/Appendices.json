We need to analyze the probabilistic relationship between them based on the given scenario.\n\nThe sample space for the component's identification number is $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. Since each number is equally likely, the probability of any specific outcome $s \\in S$ is $P(s) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nFirst, let's define the events associated with the indicator variables $X$ and $Y$.\nThe variable $X$ is 1 if the number is even. The set of even numbers is $E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$.\nThe probability that $X=1$ is $P(X=1) = P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $X$ is an indicator variable, its expected value is $E[X] = P(X=1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe variable $Y$ is 1 if the number is prime. The set of prime numbers is $P' = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$.\nThe probability that $Y=1$ is $P(Y=1) = P(P') = \\frac{|P'|}{|S|} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe expected value of $Y$ is $E[Y] = P(Y=1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's check for independence. Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if for all possible values $x$ and $y$, the joint probability satisfies $P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y)$. Let's test this for the case where $x=1$ and $y=1$.\n\nThe event $\\{X=1 \\text{ and } Y=1\\}$ corresponds to the outcome where the identification number is both even and prime. The only number in the set $S$ that satisfies this condition is 2.\nSo, the joint probability is $P(X=1, Y=1) = P(\\{2\\}) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nNow we compare this to the product of the individual probabilities:\n$P(X=1) P(Y=1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince $P(X=1, Y=1) = \\frac{1}{6}$ and $P(X=1)P(Y=1) = \\frac{1}{4}$, we have:\n$\\frac{1}{6} \\neq \\frac{1}{4}$\nBecause the condition for independence is not met for at least one pair of values, the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **not independent**.\n\nNext, let's check if the variables are uncorrelated. Two random variables are uncorrelated if their covariance is zero. The covariance is defined as $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$.\n\nWe have already calculated $E[X] = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $E[Y] = \\frac{1}{2}$. We need to find $E[XY]$.\nThe product $XY$ is a random variable that is equal to 1 if and only if both $X=1$ and $Y=1$. Otherwise, $XY=0$.\nSo, $XY$ is an indicator variable for the event that the number is both even and prime.\nAs we found before, this event corresponds to the outcome $\\{2\\}$.\nThe probability that $XY=1$ is $P(XY=1) = P(X=1, Y=1) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe expected value of $XY$ is $E[XY] = P(XY=1) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the covariance:\n$\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] = \\frac{1}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{12} - \\frac{3}{12} = -\\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nSince $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = -\\frac{1}{12} \\neq 0$, the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **correlated**. Specifically, they are negatively correlated.\n\nCombining our findings, $X$ and $Y$ are not independent and they are correlated.
