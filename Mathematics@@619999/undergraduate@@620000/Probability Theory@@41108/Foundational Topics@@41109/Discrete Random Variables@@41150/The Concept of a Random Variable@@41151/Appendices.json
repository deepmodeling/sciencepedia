Due to manufacturing variances, this batch contains 6 fully functional processors and 3 processors with a known, non-critical flaw. A quality control engineer is tasked with performing a final inspection. For this, the engineer randomly selects a sample of 4 processors from the batch for intensive testing. The selection is performed without replacement, meaning once a processor is selected, it is not returned to the batch.\n\nLet the random variable $X$ represent the number of fully functional processors in the selected sample of 4.
