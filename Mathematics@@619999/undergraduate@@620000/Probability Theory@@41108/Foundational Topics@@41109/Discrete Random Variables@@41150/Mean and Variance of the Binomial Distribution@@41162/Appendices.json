This exercise sharpens your algebraic skills and deepens your understanding of how the distribution's parameters shape its moments [@problem_id:1372826].", "problem": "A quality control process at a semiconductor manufacturing plant involves testing a sample of microprocessors from a large batch. Each microprocessor is tested, and the outcome is classified as either 'functional' (a success) or 'defective' (a failure). The total number of microprocessors in the sample is denoted by $n$. The tests are independent, and the probability, $p$, that any given microprocessor is functional is constant across the sample. The number of functional microprocessors in the sample can be modeled by a binomial distribution.\n\nFrom extensive historical data on this testing process, it has been established that the expected number of functional microprocessors in a sample is 12, and the variance of the number of functional microprocessors is 3.\n\nDetermine the size of the sample, $n$, and the probability of success, $p$.", "solution": "Let $X$ denote the number of functional microprocessors in a sample of size $n$.
