Each batch contains the same number of emitters, denoted by $n$.\n\nLet the random variable $X$ represent the number of emitters in a batch that meet the brightness specification. Extensive testing of a large number of batches reveals that the expected value of $X$ is 3, and the variance of $X$ is 2.1. Assuming the number of successful emitters per batch follows a binomial distribution, determine the total number of emitters in a batch, $n$, and the probability of success, $p$, for a single emitter.\n\nThe final answer should be a pair of values for $n$ and $p$, presented in that order.", "solution": "Let $X$ be the number of successful emitters in a batch and assume $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)$.

The scenario describes a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same two possible outcomes (meeting the standard or not) and a constant probability of success. This is characteristic of a binomial distribution.\n\nThe parameters of the binomial distribution for this problem are:\n- The number of trials, $n=8$, which is the size of the batch.\n- The probability of success (an emitter meets the standard), $p=0.80$.\n- The probability of failure (an emitter does not meet the standard), $q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a binomial distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials, and is given by the formula:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^{k} q^{n-k}$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that more than 6 emitters meet the standard. This corresponds to the event $X > 6$. Since the number of emitters must be an integer, this is equivalent to finding the probability that either 7 or 8 emitters meet the standard. We can express this as:\n$$P(X > 6) = P(X=7) + P(X=8)$$\n\nNow, we calculate each term separately using the PMF.\n\nFor $k=7$:\n$$P(X=7) = \\binom{8}{7} (0.80)^{7} (0.20)^{8-7}$$\nThe binomial coefficient is $\\binom{8}{7} = \\frac{8!}{7!(8-7)!} = \\frac{8!}{7!1!} = 8$.\nSo,\n$$P(X=7) = 8 \\cdot (0.80)^{7} \\cdot (0.20)^{1}$$\n\nFor $k=8$:\n$$P(X=8) = \\binom{8}{8} (0.80)^{8} (0.20)^{8-8}$$\nThe binomial coefficient is $\\binom{8}{8} = \\frac{8!}{8!(8-8)!} = \\frac{8!}{8!0!} = 1$.
