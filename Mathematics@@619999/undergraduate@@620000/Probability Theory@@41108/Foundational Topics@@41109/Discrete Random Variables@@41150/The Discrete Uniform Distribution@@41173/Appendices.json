The core principle at play is that when all outcomes in a sample space are equally likely, the probability of a specific event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. This exercise solidifies your understanding of this fundamental definition and how to apply it to a finite, uniform set of possibilities [@problem_id:1913743].", "problem": "A city's newly implemented smart transit system assigns a unique number to each express bus route to optimize dispatching. For a particular metropolitan area, the system randomly assigns a route number from the set of integers $\\{101, 102, 103, \\dots, 150\\}$. Each integer in this set has an equal probability of being chosen.\n\nA transit analyst is studying routes that serve a specific business district.

It demonstrates how we can use observed data, such as a sample mean from many trials, to deduce the parameters of the underlying process that generated the data. By applying the law of large numbers and the theoretical formula for the expected value, you will learn to reverse-engineer an unknown parameter, a common task in fields like quality control and system analysis [@problem_id:1913786].", "problem": "A company has developed a secure hardware random number generator. The device is designed to output an integer chosen from a discrete uniform distribution over the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, where $N$ is a fixed but unknown integer parameter programmed into the device. To reverse-engineer the value of $N$, a statistician runs the generator a very large number of times and records the outputs. The sample mean of the observed numbers converges to $50.5$.
