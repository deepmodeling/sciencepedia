Let the random variable $I$ represent the measured current in amperes (A). After collecting a very large number of data points, the team's data processing software calculates the following two statistical quantities: the expected value of the current, $E[I] = 7.2$ A, and the expected value of the squared current, $E[I^2] = 53.0$ A$^2$.\n\nUsing these values, calculate the variance of the current measurements, $\\text{Var}(I)$.
