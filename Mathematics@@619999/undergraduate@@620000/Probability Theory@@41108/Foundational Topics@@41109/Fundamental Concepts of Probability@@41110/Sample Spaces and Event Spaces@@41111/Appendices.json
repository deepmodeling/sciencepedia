Both attributes are independently chosen from the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$. The combination of these two attributes is represented by an ordered pair $(S, I)$. The set of all possible pairs $(S, I)$ constitutes the sample space $\\Omega$.\n\nThe game defines several character classes based on specific attribute requirements.
