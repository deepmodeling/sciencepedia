This exercise asks you to determine the probability that the sum of two randomly selected integers is even, a scenario framed within a simple cryptographic protocol. By analyzing the properties of even and odd numbers, you will practice the essential skill of partitioning the sample space into mutually exclusive favorable outcomes and applying combinatorial counting principles to find the solution [@problem_id:1380802].", "problem": "A simple cryptographic protocol operates using a predefined set of integers, $S$. This set $S$ contains $E$ distinct even integers and $O$ distinct odd integers, where $E$ and $O$ are non-negative integers such that the total number of integers in the set, $n = E+O$, is at least 2. For an authentication step, the protocol randomly selects two distinct integers from the set $S$ without replacement. Determine the probability that the sum of these two selected integers is an even number. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $E$ and $O$.", "solution": "Let the set $S$ contain $E$ even integers and $O$ odd integers, with total $n=E+O\\geq 2$. Two distinct integers are selected uniformly at random without replacement, so each unordered pair is equally likely.
