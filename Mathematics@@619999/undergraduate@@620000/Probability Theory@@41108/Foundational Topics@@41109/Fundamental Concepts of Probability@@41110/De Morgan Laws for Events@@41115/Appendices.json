Let's express the success of each stage in terms of the elementary events.\n\nThe success of Stage 1 requires that the person has a valid ID card ($I$) AND passes the temperature screening ($T$). In the language of set theory and probability, the \"AND\" operator corresponds to an intersection ($\\cap$). Therefore, the event for a successful Stage 1, let's call it $S_1$, is:\n$$S_1 = I \\cap T$$\n\nThe success of Stage 2 requires that the person enters the correct PIN ($P$) OR passes the voice recognition scan ($V$). The \"OR\" operator corresponds to a union ($\\cup$). Therefore, the event for a successful Stage 2, let's call it $S_2$, is:\n$$S_2 = P \\cup V$$\n\nAccess is granted, event $A$, if Stage 1 is successful AND Stage 2 is successful. This means we must take the intersection of the events $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n$$A = S_1 \\cap S_2 = (I \\cap T) \\cap (P \\cup V)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the event that access is denied, which is the complement of event $A$, denoted as $A^c$. We find this by taking the complement of the expression for $A$:\n$$A^c = ((I \\cap T) \\cap (P \\cup V))^c$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we apply De Morgan's laws. The first relevant law is $(X \\cap Y)^c = X^c \\cup Y^c$. Let $X = (I \\cap T)$ and $Y = (P \\cup V)$. Applying this law, we get:\n$$A^c = (I \\cap T)^c \\cup (P \\cup V)^c$$\n\nNow we have two smaller complements to simplify. We apply De Morgan's laws again to each part:\n1.  For the first part, $(I \\cap T)^c$, we use the law $(X \\cap Y)^c = X^c \\cup Y^c$. This gives us:\n    $$(I \\cap T)^c = I^c \\cup T^c$$\n2.  For the second part, $(P \\cup V)^c$, we use the law $(X \\cup Y)^c = X^c \\cap Y^c$. This gives us:\n    $$(P \\cup V)^c = P^c \\cap V^c$$\n\nFinally, we substitute these simplified parts back into our expression for $A^c$:\n$$A^c = (I^c \\cup T^c) \\cup (P^c \\cap V^c)$$\n\nThis expression represents the event that access is denied. In words, it means a person is denied access if they fail Stage 1 (they do not have a valid ID OR they do not pass the temperature check) OR they fail Stage 2 (they do not enter the correct PIN AND they do not pass the voice scan).\n\nComparing our result with the given choices, we see that it matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1355735"}, {"introduction": "Moving from pure logic to quantitative analysis, this problem asks you to calculate the probability of a mission failure for a deep space probe. This exercise demonstrates the practical power of De Morgan's laws; by first defining the complex event of mission success, you can then find the probability of its complement, mission failure.
