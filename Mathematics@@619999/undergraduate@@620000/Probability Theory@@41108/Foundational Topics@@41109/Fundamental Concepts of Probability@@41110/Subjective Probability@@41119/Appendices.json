Based on historical data and expert opinion, the manager establishes a subjective probability distribution for the project delay, measured in whole weeks. The probabilities for the delay duration, denoted by the random variable $D$, are as follows:\n- Probability of 0 weeks delay: $P(D=0) = 0.60$\n- Probability of 1 week delay: $P(D=1) = 0.25$\n- Probability of 2 weeks delay: $P(D=2) = 0.10$\n- Probability of 3 weeks delay: $P(D=3) = 0.05$\n\nAny delay incurs a cost overrun. A delay of zero weeks results in no additional cost.
