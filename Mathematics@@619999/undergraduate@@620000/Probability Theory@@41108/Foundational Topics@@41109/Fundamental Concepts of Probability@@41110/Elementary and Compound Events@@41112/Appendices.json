It begins at the origin, position $X_0 = 0$. At each discrete time step, the particle moves one unit to the right (a \"+1\" move) with a fixed probability $p$, or one unit to the left (a \"-1\" move) with probability $q = 1-p$. The probability $p$ is constant and lies in the range $0 < p < 1$.\n\nThe particle is allowed to take a total of $N=6$ steps.

The particle takes $N=6$ steps. Let $n_+$ be the number of \"+1\" steps (right) and $n_-$ be the number of \"-1\" steps (left).\nThe total number of steps is $n_+ + n_- = 6$.\nThe final position is the net displacement, so $X_6 = n_+ - n_- = 2$.\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations:\n1) $n_+ + n_- = 6$\n2) $n_+ - n_- = 2$\n\nAdding the two equations gives $2n_+ = 8$, which implies $n_+ = 4$.\nSubstituting $n_+=4$ into the first equation gives $4 + n_- = 6$, which implies $n_- = 2$.\nSo, for the final position to be $X_6=2$, the particle must have taken exactly 4 steps to the right and 2 steps to the left.\n\nThe total number of distinct paths (sequences of moves) that result in 4 right steps and 2 left steps is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{4}$:\n$$N_A = \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!2!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$$\nEach specific path consists of 4 right moves (each with probability $p$) and 2 left moves (each with probability $q$).

This is the event where the particle ends at $X_6=2$ AND its path never goes below the origin $X=0$.\nThis means we need to count the number of paths with 4 right moves and 2 left moves that satisfy the condition $X_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$. Let's call this number $N_{A \\cap B}$.\n\nThis is a classic path-counting problem that can be solved using the reflection principle. The total number of paths from an initial point $(x_i, y_i)$ to a final point $(x_f, y_f)$ is $\\binom{x_f-x_i}{(y_f-y_i+x_f-x_i)/2}$. In our case, a path is a sequence of steps in time, so we can map it to a 2D lattice where the x-axis is the step number and the y-axis is the particle's position. The path goes from $(0,0)$ to $(6,2)$.\nThe number of \"good\" paths (that don't go below $y=0$) is the total number of paths minus the number of \"bad\" paths (that touch or cross the line $y=-1$).\n\nThe reflection principle states that the number of paths from $(x_i, y_i)$ to $(x_f, y_f)$ that touch or cross a horizontal line $y=c$ is equal to the number of paths from $(x_i, y_i)$ to the reflected final point $(x_f, 2c-y_f)$.\nHere, our path goes from $(0,0)$ to $(6,2)$, and the forbidden line is $y=-1$ (so $c=-1$).\nThe number of bad paths is the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to the reflected point $(6, 2(-1)-2) = (6,-4)$.\n\nTo find the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(6,-4)$, we determine the required number of right ($n_+'$) and left ($n_-'$) steps:\n$n_+' + n_-' = 6$\n$n_+' - n_-' = -4$\nAdding these equations gives $2n_+' = 2$, so $n_+' = 1$. This implies $n_-' = 5$.\nThe number of such paths is $\\binom{6}{1} = \\frac{6!}{1!5!} = 6$.\nSo, there are 6 \"bad\" paths among the 15 total paths to $(6,2)$.\n\nThe number of \"good\" paths, $N_{A \\cap B}$, is the total number of paths for event A minus the number of bad paths:\n$$N_{A \\cap B} = N_A - (\\text{Number of bad paths}) = 15 - 6 = 9$$\nEach of these 9 paths has a probability of $p^4 q^2$. Therefore, the probability of the joint event $A \\cap B$ is:\n$$P(A \\cap B) = 9 p^4 q^2$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the conditional probability $P(B|A)$:\n$$P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} = \\frac{9 p^4 q^2}{15 p^4 q^2}$$\nThe terms $p^4 q^2$ cancel out, showing that the result is independent of the specific probability $p$.\n$$P(B|A) = \\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$$", "id": "1359719"}]}
