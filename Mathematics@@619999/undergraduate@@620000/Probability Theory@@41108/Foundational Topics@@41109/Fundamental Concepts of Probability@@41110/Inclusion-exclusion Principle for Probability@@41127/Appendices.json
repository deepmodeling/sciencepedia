While the inclusion-exclusion principle could be used directly, it is often far more efficient to calculate the probability of the complement event, as demonstrated in this exercise [@problem_id:1364761]. By finding the probability that an event does *not* happen, we can easily find the probability that it *does* happen, a technique that is indispensable in a probabilist's toolkit and leverages De Morgan's laws: $P(A \\cup B) = 1 - P(A^c \\cap B^c)$.", "problem": "In a specialized data communication protocol, each data frame consists of a total number of bits, $N$. These bits are categorized into three distinct types: $N_E$ Error-Correction Code (ECC) bits, $N_S$ Synchronization (SYNC) bits, and $N_D$ payload data bits. The total number of bits is the sum of these categories, so $N = N_E + N_S + N_D$. For a security audit, a monitoring system randomly selects a sample of $k$ distinct bits from a single data frame for analysis. This sampling is done without replacement. Given that the sample size $k$ is less than or equal to the number of payload data bits ($k \\le N_D$), determine the probability that the sample contains at least one ECC bit or at least one SYNC bit.\n\nExpress your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $N_E$, $N_S$, $N_D$, and $k$.", "solution": "Let $E$ be the event that the randomly selected sample of $k$ bits contains at least one ECC bit or at least one SYNC bit. Let $A$ be the event that the sample contains at least one ECC bit, and let $B$ be the event that the sample contains at least one SYNC bit. We are asked to find the probability of the union of these events, $P(E) = P(A \\cup B)$.\n\nThe total number of bits in the data frame is $N = N_E + N_S + N_D$. The total number of ways to choose a sample of $k$ distinct bits from these $N$ bits is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{k}$. This is the size of our sample space.\n\nCalculating $P(A \\cup B)$ directly using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$, would involve calculating the probability of three separate complex events (\"at least one...\"). A more efficient approach for \"at least one\" problems is to calculate the probability of the complement event, $E^c$, and use the relation $P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$.\n\nThe complement event, $E^c$, is the event that the sample does *not* contain \"at least one ECC bit or at least one SYNC bit\". By De Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to the event \"(not at least one ECC bit) AND (not at least one SYNC bit)\". This simplifies to \"zero ECC bits AND zero SYNC bits\".\n\nFor a sample to contain zero ECC bits and zero SYNC bits, all $k$ bits in the sample must be chosen exclusively from the payload data bits. There are $N_D$ payload data bits available. The number of ways to choose a sample of $k$ bits entirely from the $N_D$ data bits is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N_D}{k}$.\n\nThe probability of the complement event, $P(E^c)$, is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes for $E^c$ to the total number of possible outcomes:\n$$P(E^c) = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose k data bits}}{\\text{Total number of ways to choose k bits}} = \\frac{\\binom{N_D}{k}}{\\binom{N}{k}}$$\nThe problem states that $k \\le N_D$, which ensures that it is possible to form such a sample, and the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N_D}{k}$ is well-defined.\n\nFinally, the probability of the event $E$ (that the sample contains at least one ECC bit or at least one SYNC bit) is:\n$$P(E) = 1 - P(E^c) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{N_D}{k}}{\\binom{N}{k}}$$\nTo express the answer solely in terms of the given parameters $N_E$, $N_S$, $N_D$, and $k$, we substitute $N = N_E + N_S + N_D$ into the denominator:\n$$P(E) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{N_D}{k}}{\\binom{N_E + N_S + N_D}{k}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\frac{\\binom{N_D}{k}}{\\binom{N_E + N_S + N_D}{k}}}$$", "id": "1364761"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercise, this problem presents a scenario where choosing the right strategy is the key to a simple solution.
