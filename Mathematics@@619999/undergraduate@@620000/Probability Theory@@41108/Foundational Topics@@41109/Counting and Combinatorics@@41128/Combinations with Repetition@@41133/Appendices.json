This exercise explores the fundamental scenario of combinations with repetition, often visualized with the 'stars and bars' method. By determining the number of ways to allocate investment funds, you will practice applying the basic formula for finding non-negative integer solutions to a linear equation, a cornerstone of combinatorial mathematics [@problem_id:1349443].", "problem": "An investment analyst at a venture capital firm is tasked with allocating a total of $300,000 into six distinct emerging technology funds. The six funds are: a quantum computing fund, a synthetic biology fund, a next-generation battery fund, a decentralized finance fund, a space exploration fund, and an advanced materials fund. Due to the firm's investment policies, capital must be allocated in discrete blocks of $10,000. Any number of blocks, including zero, can be allocated to any of the six funds, as long as the total sum allocated is exactly $300,000. How many different allocation strategies are possible?", "solution": "Let $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},x_{5},x_{6}$ denote the number of allocated blocks of size $10{,}000$ dollars to the six funds, respectively. Each $x_{i}$ must be a nonnegative integer, and the total allocation constraint is exactly $300{,}000$ dollars. Since each block is $10{,}000$ dollars, the total number of blocks is\n$$\n\\frac{300{,}000}{10{,}000}=30.\n$$\nTherefore, the allocation problem is equivalent to counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions to\n$$\nx_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}+x_{5}+x_{6}=30.\n$$\nBy the stars-and-bars theorem, the number of solutions in nonnegative integers to $x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{k}=n$ is\n$$\n\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}.\n$$\nHere $n=30$ and $k=6$, so the number of allocation strategies is\n$$\n\\binom{30+6-1}{6-1}=\\binom{35}{5}.\n$$\nEvaluating,\n$$\n\\binom{35}{5}=\\frac{35!}{5!\\,30!}=\\frac{35\\cdot 34\\cdot 33\\cdot 32\\cdot 31}{5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}=324{,}632.\n$$\nThus, there are $\\binom{35}{5}=324{,}632$ distinct allocation strategies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{324632}$$", "id": "1349443"}, {"introduction": "Real-world distribution problems often come with constraints, such as ensuring every recipient receives at least one item.
