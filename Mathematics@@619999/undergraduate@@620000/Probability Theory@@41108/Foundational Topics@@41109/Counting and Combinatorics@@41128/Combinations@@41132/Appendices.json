Instead of trying to count the valid arrangements directly, it is often simpler to count all possible arrangements and then subtract the ones that violate the condition, a strategy known as the subtraction principle.

From a set of 20 distinct proteins available for screening, they need to form a test group containing exactly 5 proteins. However, two of the proteins, let's call them Protein Alpha and Protein Beta, are known to be structurally inhibitory to each other. Consequently, they cannot both be included in the same test group. It is permissible to include one of them without the other, or neither of them.\n\nHow many different test groups of 5 proteins can be formed under this restriction?", "solution": "We model the test group as a 5-element subset chosen from 20 distinct proteins. Without restrictions, the number of such groups is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{20}{5}$.\n\nThe restriction forbids including both Protein Alpha ($A$) and Protein Beta ($B$) together. We count the invalid groups that contain both $A$ and $B$, then subtract them from the total. If both $A$ and $B$ are included, the remaining $3$ proteins must be chosen from the other $18$ proteins, which can be done in $\\binom{18}{3}$ ways. By the subtraction principle, the number of valid groups is\n$$\n\\binom{20}{5}-\\binom{18}{3}.\n$$\nEvaluating these binomial coefficients,\n$$\n\\binom{20}{5}=\\frac{20\\cdot 19\\cdot 18\\cdot 17\\cdot 16}{5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}=15504,\n\\qquad\n\\binom{18}{3}=\\frac{18\\cdot 17\\cdot 16}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}=816.\n$$\nTherefore, the number of valid test groups is\n$$\n15504-816=14688.\n$$\nAs a consistency check via casework: either include neither $A$ nor $B$ (giving $\\binom{18}{5}$ ways) or include exactly one of them (choose which one in $2$ ways and then choose $4$ from the remaining $18$, giving $2\\binom{18}{4}$).
