The hunter's skill is such that the probability of successfully picking the lock, given that it is locked, is $1/4$.\n\nWhat is the overall probability that the treasure hunter will be able to access the treasure inside the chest? Provide your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "Let $L$ denote the event that the chest is locked and $U$ the event that it is unlocked, with $U = L^{c}$. Let $S$ denote the event that the treasure is accessed. We are given $P(L) = \\frac{3}{5}$, hence $P(U) = 1 - P(L) = 1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$. If the chest is unlocked, the treasure is accessed with certainty, so $P(S \\mid U) = 1$. If the chest is locked, the probability of successfully picking the lock is $P(S \\mid L) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nBy the law of total probability,\n$$\nP(S) = P(S \\mid U)P(U) + P(S \\mid L)P(L).\n$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities,\n$$\nP(S) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{20}.\n$$\nExpressing with a common denominator,\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{8}{20} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad P(S) = \\frac{8}{20} + \\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{11}{20}.\n$$\nTherefore, the overall probability that the treasure hunter can access the treasure is $\\frac{11}{20}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{11}{20}}$$", "id": "1408415"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundation of sequential events, this exercise introduces a common and powerful form of probabilistic reasoning: inferring the cause from an observed effect. We often know the outcome of a process and wish to determine the likelihood of the preceding conditions.

From extensive historical data, the restaurant manager knows that 60% of patrons choose the prix-fixe menu, while the remaining 40% order à la carte.\n\nThe restaurant is particularly famous for its Tarte Tatin. A patron who selects the prix-fixe menu has a 50% chance of choosing the Tarte Tatin from the available dessert options. A patron ordering à la carte, who has a wider dessert menu to choose from, has a 20% chance of ordering the Tarte Tatin.\n\nA waiter is carrying a freshly prepared Tarte Tatin to a table, but you do not know which menu the patron at that table selected. Given only this observation, what is the probability that the patron chose the prix-fixe menu?\n\nExpress your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "Let's define the events for our probabilistic model.\nLet $F$ be the event that a patron chooses the prix-fixe menu.\nLet $A$ be the event that a patron orders à la carte.\nLet $T$ be the event that a patron has the Tarte Tatin for dessert.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe probability of a patron choosing the prix-fixe menu is $P(F) = 0.60$.\nThe probability of a patron ordering à la carte is $P(A) = 0.40$. Note that $P(A) = 1 - P(F)$.\n\nWe are also given the conditional probabilities of a patron choosing the Tarte Tatin, given their menu choice:\nThe probability of choosing the Tarte Tatin given the prix-fixe menu was selected is $P(T|F) = 0.50$.\nThe probability of choosing the Tarte Tatin given the à la carte menu was selected is $P(T|A) = 0.20$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the patron chose the prix-fixe menu, given that they ordered a Tarte Tatin. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(F|T)$.\n\nTo find this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{P(T|F) P(F)}{P(T)}$$\n\nWe know $P(T|F)$ and $P(F)$, but we first need to calculate $P(T)$, the total probability that any randomly chosen patron orders a Tarte Tatin. We can find this using the Law of Total Probability. A patron can order a Tarte Tatin either by having chosen the prix-fixe menu or by having ordered à la carte. These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.\nThe formula for the Law of Total Probability is:\n$$P(T) = P(T|F)P(F) + P(T|A)P(A)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula:\n$$P(T) = (0.50)(0.60) + (0.20)(0.40)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.30 + 0.08$$\n$$P(T) = 0.38$$\n\nSo, the overall probability that a patron orders a Tarte Tatin is 0.38.\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into our Bayes' Theorem formula for $P(F|T)$:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{P(T|F) P(F)}{P(T)}$$\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{(0.50)(0.60)}{0.38}$$\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{0.30}{0.38}$$\n\nTo express this as an exact fraction in simplest form, we can write the decimals as fractions:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{30/100}{38/100} = \\frac{30}{38}$$\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n$$P(F|T) = \\frac{30 \\div 2}{38 \\div 2} = \\frac{15}{19}$$\n\nThus, the probability that the patron chose the prix-fixe menu given they ordered a Tarte Tatin is $\\frac{15}{19}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{15}{19}}$$", "id": "1408389"}, {"introduction": "Beyond calculating a single probability, tree diagrams are powerful tools for analyzing the overall behavior of a stochastic process.
