Why does the order in which we list the group sizes not affect the final count? This practice moves beyond calculation and asks for a *combinatorial justification*, encouraging you to build a logical argument based on a one-to-one correspondence rather than relying on algebraic manipulation. [@problem_id:1386563]", "problem": "A project manager is responsible for assigning 10 distinct software development tasks to three specialized teams: the Analytics team (Team A), the Backend team (Team B), and the Client-side team (Team C). According to the project plan, Team A must be assigned 2 tasks, Team B must be assigned 3 tasks, and Team C must be assigned 5 tasks. The number of distinct ways to make this assignment is calculated by the multinomial coefficient $\\binom{10}{2, 3, 5}$.\n\nA colleague points out that if the requirements were swapped between the Analytics and Client-side teams (i.e., Team A gets 5 tasks, Team B gets 3, and Team C gets 2), the number of ways to assign the tasks would be given by $\\binom{10}{5, 3, 2}$, and a quick calculation shows that $\\binom{10}{2, 3, 5} = \\binom{10}{5, 3, 2}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental *combinatorial justification* for this equality?\n\nA. For every specific assignment of tasks in the (2, 3, 5) distribution, there is a unique corresponding assignment in the (5, 3, 2) distribution created by simply swapping the task sets assigned to Team A and Team C. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of possible assignments, so their sizes must be equal.\n\nB. The equality is a direct result of the formula for the multinomial coefficient, which is $\\frac{10!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!}$. Since multiplication in the denominator is commutative, $2! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 5! = 5! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 2!$, which makes the two final fractions equal in value.\n\nC. The assignment process can be thought of as first arranging the 10 distinct tasks in a line, an operation with $10!$ possible outcomes. The distribution to teams happens after this arrangement, and since the initial number of arrangements is the same in both scenarios, the final count of distinct assignments must also be the same.\n\nD. This combinatorial symmetry, where the order of the group sizes does not affect the total number of arrangements, is a special property that only holds true when the total number of items to be distributed (in this case, 10) is an even number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the best combinatorial justification for the equality $\\binom{10}{2, 3, 5} = \\binom{10}{5, 3, 2}$. A combinatorial justification, also known as a combinatorial argument or proof by double counting, explains why two quantities are equal by showing that they both count the number of elements in the same set, or by establishing a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between two different sets.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** This option proposes a bijection. Let $S_1$ be the set of all possible ways to assign the 10 distinct tasks such that Team A gets 2 tasks, Team B gets 3, and Team C gets 5. The size of this set is $|S_1| = \\binom{10}{2, 3, 5}$.\nLet $S_2$ be the set of all possible ways to assign the 10 distinct tasks such that Team A gets 5 tasks, Team B gets 3, and Team C gets 2. The size of this set is $|S_2| = \\binom{10}{5, 3, 2}$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary assignment from $S_1$. This assignment consists of a partition of the 10 tasks into three specific sets of tasks, let's call them $T_A$, $T_B$, and $T_C$, where $|T_A|=2$, $|T_B|=3$, and $|T_C|=5$. The assignment is $(T_A \\to \\text{Team A}, T_B \\to \\text{Team B}, T_C \\to \\text{Team C})$.\n\nWe can create a mapping from an element in $S_1$ to an element in $S_2$. For the assignment given above, we can define a new assignment where Team A receives the set of tasks $T_C$, Team B still receives $T_B$, and Team C receives $T_A$. This new assignment gives 5 tasks to Team A, 3 to Team B, and 2 to Team C, so it is a valid element of $S_2$.\n\nThis mapping is a bijection:\n1.  **It is one-to-one (injective):** If we start with two different assignments in $S_1$, they must differ in at least one of the sets $T_A$, $T_B$, or $T_C$. When we swap the task sets for Team A and Team C, the resulting assignments in $S_2$ will also be different.\n2.  **It is onto (surjective):** Any assignment in $S_2$ can be mapped back to a unique assignment in $S_1$. For any assignment in $S_2$, which gives a set of 5 tasks to Team A and a set of 2 tasks to Team C, we can simply reverse the swap to obtain a valid assignment in $S_1$.\n\nSince there is a bijection between the finite sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, they must contain the same number of elements. Therefore, $|S_1| = |S_2|$. This is a perfect example of a combinatorial argument.\n\n**Option B:** This option points out that the algebraic formula yields the same result because the factors in the denominator can be reordered. While this is true and explains why the numbers are identical, it is an *algebraic* justification, not a *combinatorial* one. The question specifically asks for a combinatorial justification, which should be based on counting principles rather than formulaic manipulation.\n\n**Option C:** This option presents a flawed argument. It correctly states there are $10!$ ways to arrange the tasks in a line, but it fails to account for the fact that the order of tasks *within* each team's assignment does not matter. The multinomial coefficient formula $\\binom{10}{2, 3, 5} = \\frac{10!}{2!3!5!}$ correctly accounts for this by dividing out the permutations of tasks within each group. The argument in this option ignores this crucial division step and is therefore incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** This option introduces a false premise. The symmetry of the multinomial coefficient with respect to permutations of its lower indices holds true for any total number of items $n$, whether even or odd. The bijective argument presented in the analysis of Option A works just as well for $n=11$ (e.g., $\\binom{11}{2, 3, 6} = \\binom{11}{6, 3, 2}$) as it does for $n=10$. Therefore, this statement is incorrect and misleading.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A provides the most accurate and fundamental combinatorial justification for the equality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1386563"}, {"introduction": "The power of multinomial coefficients extends beyond counting physical arrangements into the realm of algebra.
