Therefore, we need to calculate the probability that Alice wins the game, given the score is 28-28 and it is her turn. Let this probability be $P_{win}$.\n\nThe state of the game can be described by the tuple $(S_A, S_B, T)$, where $S_A$ is Alice's score, $S_B$ is Bob's score, and $T$ is the player whose turn it is.

After her move, it will be Bob's turn. Thus, Alice's win probability is:\n$$P(S_A, S_B) = p \\cdot Q(S_A+1, S_B) + (1-p) \\cdot Q(S_A+2, S_B)$$\nIf it is Bob's turn, he can score 1 point or 2 points.

So, $P(S_A, S_B) = 1$ and $Q(S_A, S_B) = 1$.\nIf $S_B \\ge 30$, Bob has already won. So, $P(S_A, S_B) = 0$ and $Q(S_A, S_B) = 0$.\n\nWe need to calculate $P(28, 28)$. Let's work backwards from the states closest to victory.\n\nStep 1: Calculate $P(28, 28)$.\nUsing the recurrence relation for Alice's turn:\n$$P(28, 28) = p \\cdot Q(29, 28) + (1-p) \\cdot Q(30, 28)$$\nAccording to our boundary conditions, since Alice's score in $(30, 28)$ is 30, she has already won. Thus, $Q(30, 28) = 1$.\n$$P(28, 28) = p \\cdot Q(29, 28) + (1-p) \\cdot 1$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate $Q(29, 28)$.\nThis is the probability Alice wins when the score is (29, 28) and it is Bob's turn.\nUsing the recurrence relation for Bob's turn:\n$$Q(29, 28) = p \\cdot P(29, 29) + (1-p) \\cdot P(29, 30)$$\nAccording to our boundary conditions, since Bob's score in $(29, 30)$ is 30, Bob has won. Thus, Alice's probability of winning from this state is 0, so $P(29, 30) = 0$.\n$$Q(29, 28) = p \\cdot P(29, 29) + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = p \\cdot P(29, 29)$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate $P(29, 29)$.\nThis is the probability Alice wins when the score is (29, 29) and it is her turn.\nUsing the recurrence relation for Alice's turn:\n$$P(29, 29) = p \\cdot Q(30, 29) + (1-p) \\cdot Q(31, 29)$$\nIn both resulting states, $(30, 29)$ and $(31, 29)$, Alice's score is $\\ge 30$. Therefore, she has won. This means $Q(30, 29) = 1$ and $Q(31, 29) = 1$.\n$$P(29, 29) = p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot 1 = p + 1 - p = 1$$\nThis makes sense: if the score is 29-29 and it's Alice's turn, she needs only one more point. Since her turn guarantees she scores at least one point, her victory is certain.\n\nStep 4: Substitute back to find the solution.\nFrom Step 3, we have $P(29, 29) = 1$.\nSubstitute this into the result from Step 2:\n$$Q(29, 28) = p \\cdot P(29, 29) = p \\cdot 1 = p$$\nNow, substitute this into the result from Step 1:\n$$P(28, 28) = p \\cdot Q(29, 28) + (1-p) = p \\cdot p + (1-p) = p^2 + 1 - p$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the numerical value.\nThe problem states that $p = 2/3$.\n$$P_{\\text{win}} = P(28, 28) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 + 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{7}{9}$$\n\nThe proportion of the prize that should be awarded to Alice is her probability of winning, which is $7/9$.
