Instead of directly counting the configurations we want, it can be much easier to count all possible configurations and then subtract those we wish to exclude. This exercise [@problem_id:1402656] demonstrates how the multiplication principle combines with complementary counting to efficiently solve problems that include an 'at least one' condition, a very common scenario in probability and computer science.", "problem": "A technology company is designing a deployment strategy for its Content Delivery Network (CDN). The company needs to distribute three distinct, large data files—a video game client, a feature film, and an operating system update—across its network of servers. The network consists of 12 distinct servers located in different geographical regions. For distribution, each of the three files must be placed on exactly one server. A single server is capable of hosting multiple files.\n\nAmong the 12 servers, 4 are classified as \"premium\" high-bandwidth servers, while the other 8 are \"standard\" servers. Company policy dictates that for any valid deployment, at least one of the three files must be hosted on a premium server to ensure high-speed access for critical content.\n\nHow many different ways can the three files be distributed across the 12 servers while adhering to this policy?", "solution": "Let the set of files be $F$ with $|F|=3$ (distinct files), and the set of servers be $S$ with $|S|=12$, partitioned into $P$ (premium) with $|P|=4$ and $Q$ (standard) with $|Q|=8$. A deployment assigns each file to exactly one server, allowing multiple files on the same server. Thus, each deployment corresponds to a function $f: F \\to S$.\n\nBy the multiplication principle, the total number of unrestricted deployments is\n$$\n12^{3}\n$$.\n\nInvalid deployments are those with no file on a premium server, i.e., $f(F) \\subseteq Q$. The number of such deployments is\n$$\n8^{3}\n$$.\n\nBy the complement rule, the number of valid deployments with at least one file on a premium server is\n$$\n12^{3} - 8^{3} = 1728 - 512 = 1216\n$$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1216}$$", "id": "1402656"}, {"introduction": "When objects in a sequence are subject to placement restrictions, such as not being adjacent, a structured approach is essential. This problem guides you to count arrangements by first handling the constrained elements—in this case, placing the flags that cannot be next to each other—and then applying the multiplication principle to the remaining independent choices [@problem_id:1402685]. This method of breaking a complex problem into simpler stages is a cornerstone of combinatorial analysis.", "problem": "A signal corps develops a system for creating coded messages by arranging 8 flags in a straight line. The available flags are in three colors: red, blue, and yellow. For a message to be considered valid, it must satisfy a specific set of rules:\n1. The message must contain exactly two red flags.\n2. The two red flags cannot be placed in adjacent positions.\n3. The remaining six positions must be filled with flags that are either blue or yellow.\n\nHow many distinct valid coded messages can be formed under these rules?", "solution": "We have sequences of length $8$ over the alphabet $\\{R,B,Y\\}$ with exactly two $R$ and no adjacent $R$. First count the placements of the two red flags. The total number of unordered pairs of positions from $8$ is $\\binom{8}{2}$. The adjacent pairs are $(1,2),(2,3),\\ldots,(7,8)$, which are $7$ pairs. Hence the number of ways to place two nonadjacent red flags is\n$$\n\\binom{8}{2}-7=28-7=21\n$$.\nFor each such placement, the remaining $6$ positions can each be filled independently with either $B$ or $Y$, giving $2^{6}$ possibilities. Therefore, the total number of valid messages is\n$$\n\\left(\\binom{8}{2}-7\\right)2^{6}=21\\cdot 2^{6}=21\\cdot 64=1344\n$$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1344}$$", "id": "1402685"}, {"introduction": "The multiplication principle typically counts sequences of events, but how does a constraint on the process affect the final outcome? This advanced problem challenges you to connect a dynamic process with its own sequential rules to the set of achievable final states [@problem_id:1402635]. Solving it requires moving beyond a simple count of sequences to a deeper analysis of combinatorial possibility, a key skill for tackling more abstract problems in various scientific fields.", "problem": "A robotic arm is programmed to sort 5 identical components into 3 distinct quality-control bins, labeled Bin 1, Bin 2, and Bin 3. The sorting process consists of 5 sequential steps, where in each step, the arm places one component into one of the bins. To prevent mechanical strain, the arm is programmed with a specific constraint: it cannot place components into the same bin on two consecutive steps. A final configuration is described by the number of components in each of the three bins. Determine the total number of distinct final configurations possible at the end of the sorting process.", "solution": "Let the final configuration be the triple $(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$ with $x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ and $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=5$. Such a configuration is achievable if and only if there exists an arrangement of a multiset containing $x_{i}$ copies of symbol $i$ (for $i=1,2,3$) into a sequence of length $5$ with no two consecutive identical symbols.\n\nLet $m=\\max\\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\}$. A necessary condition for such an arrangement is that the $m$ identical items can be separated by the other $5-m$ items. Since the $m$ identical items create $m-1$ internal gaps that must be filled to avoid adjacency, we require\n$$\n5 - m \\geq m - 1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 2m \\leq 6 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad m \\leq 3\n$$.\nThis condition is also sufficient: if $m \\leq 3$, then $5-m \\geq m-1$ holds, and we can interleave the $m$ items with the other $5-m$ items to avoid equal adjacencies. Hence, the achievable configurations are exactly those triples with $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=5$ and $\\max\\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\} \\leq 3$.\n\nWe now count such triples. The total number of nonnegative integer solutions to $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=5$ is\n$$\n\\binom{5+3-1}{3-1}=\\binom{7}{2}=21\n$$.\nWe must exclude those with a component equal to $4$ or $5$:\n- Triples with a $5$ are of the form $(5,0,0)$ and its permutations, yielding $3$ configurations.\n- Triples with a $4$ are of the form $(4,1,0)$ and its permutations. Choosing the bin with $4$ in $3$ ways and the bin with $1$ in $2$ ways gives $3 \\times 2=6$ configurations.\n\nSubtracting these,\n$$\n21 - 3 - 6 = 12\n$$.\nTherefore, there are $12$ distinct final configurations achievable under the constraint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1402635"}]}
