The experiment involves rolling two six-sided dice. The outcome can be represented by an ordered pair $(d_1, d_2)$, where $d_1$ is the result of the first die and $d_2$ is the result of the second die. Each die can show a number from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nThe total number of possible outcomes is $|S| = 6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nNext, let's identify the set of outcomes corresponding to event $B$, where the sum of the dice is 8.\n$$\nB = \\{(d_1, d_2) | d_1 + d_2 = 8\\}\n$$\nListing the pairs:\n$B = \\{(2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)\\}$\nThe number of outcomes in event $B$ is $|B| = 5$.\n\nNow, let's identify the set of outcomes for the intersection event $A \\cap B$.
