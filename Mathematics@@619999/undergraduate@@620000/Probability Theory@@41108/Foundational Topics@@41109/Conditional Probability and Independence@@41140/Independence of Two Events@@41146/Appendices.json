A study is conducted on a large population to investigate the co-occurrence of two specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are variations at a single position in a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a randomly selected individual from the population has the first SNP, and let $B$ be the event that the individual has the second SNP. Through extensive genetic sequencing, the following probabilities have been estimated:\n*   The probability of an individual having the first SNP is $P(A) = 0.200$.\n*   The probability of an individual having the second SNP is $P(B) = 0.0500$.\n*   The probability of an individual having both SNPs is $P(A \\cap B) = 0.0135$.\n\nTwo events are statistically independent if the probability of them occurring together is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.
