After a fixed period of exposure, the cell's power conversion efficiency, represented as a fraction $X$ of its initial pristine efficiency, is found to be a continuous random variable.

The cost of this restoration is not linear. It is modeled to be proportional to the square of the efficiency loss. The efficiency loss is defined as $(1-x)$. Specifically, the cost function, in a normalized monetary unit, is given by $C(x) = k(1-x)^2$, where $k$ is a positive constant representing the cost to fully restore a cell that has completely degraded (i.e., its efficiency is zero).\n\nDetermine the expected cost, $E[C(X)]$, of applying the restoration process to a cell after the exposure period.
