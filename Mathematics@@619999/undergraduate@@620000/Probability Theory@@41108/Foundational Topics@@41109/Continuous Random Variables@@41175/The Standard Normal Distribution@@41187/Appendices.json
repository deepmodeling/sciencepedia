For a certain gas under specific conditions, the velocity component $V_x$ follows a normal distribution with a mean $\\mu = 0$ m/s (since there is no bulk flow of the gas) and a standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n\nTo make analyses independent of the specific temperature and particle mass (which determine $\\sigma$), it is standard practice to work with the standardized velocity $Z = V_x / \\sigma$. This variable $Z$ follows the standard normal distribution, which has a probability density function (PDF), $\\phi(z)$, given by:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nFor a continuous distribution, the probability of observing a single, exact value is zero. For instance, the probability that a particle has a standardized velocity of *exactly* 0 is $P(Z=0) = 0$. However, the value of the PDF at a point, $\\phi(z)$, is not a probability itself but rather a measure of probability density. The point of maximum probability density corresponds to the most likely region for the random variable.
