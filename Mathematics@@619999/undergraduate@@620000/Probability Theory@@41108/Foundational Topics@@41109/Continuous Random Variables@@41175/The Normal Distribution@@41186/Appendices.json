Specifically, $P(Z \\le -z) = 1 - P(Z \\le z)$. Therefore, $P(Z \\le -z_{0.75}) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$. This means the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.25 is $z_{0.25} = -z_{0.75} = -0.6745$.\n\nNow we can set up a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$:\n\nFor the 25th percentile (also known as the first quartile, $Q_1$):\n$z_{0.25} = \\frac{74.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n$-0.6745 = \\frac{74.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$  (Equation 1)\n\nFor the 75th percentile (also known as the third quartile, $Q_3$):\n$z_{0.75} = \\frac{75.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n$0.6745 = \\frac{75.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$  (Equation 2)\n\nWe can solve this system.

A normal distribution is fully specified by its mean and variance.\n\nLet's find the mean (expected value) of $Y$, denoted as $E[Y]$ or $\\mu_Y$.\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[Y] = E[X_1 - X_2] = E[X_1] - E[X_2]$$\nSince $X_1$ and $X_2$ are identically distributed, they have the same mean, $\\mu$.\n$$E[Y] = \\mu - \\mu = 0$$\nSo, the mean of $Y$ is $\\mu_Y = 0$.\n\nNext, let's find the variance of $Y$, denoted as $Var(Y)$ or $\\sigma_Y^2$.\nFor the variance of a sum or difference of **independent** random variables, the variances add:\n$$Var(Y) = Var(X_1 - X_2) = Var(X_1) + Var(-X_2)$$\nUsing the property $Var(aX) = a^2Var(X)$, we have $Var(-X_2) = (-1)^2 Var(X_2) = Var(X_2)$.\n$$Var(Y) = Var(X_1) + Var(X_2)$$\nSince $X_1$ and $X_2$ are identically distributed, they have the same variance, $\\sigma^2$.\n$$Var(Y) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2$$\nSo, the variance of $Y$ is $\\sigma_Y^2 = 2\\sigma^2$.\n\nWe have established that $Y$ follows a normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and a variance of $2\\sigma^2$.\n$$Y \\sim N(0, 2\\sigma^2)$$\nThe probability density function (PDF) of any normal distribution is symmetric about its mean.
