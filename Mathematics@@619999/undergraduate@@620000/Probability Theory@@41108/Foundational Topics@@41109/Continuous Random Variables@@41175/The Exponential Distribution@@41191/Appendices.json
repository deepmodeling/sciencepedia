At its heart, this exercise [@problem_id:1302086] is designed to demonstrate the power and elegance of the exponential distribution's signature feature: the memoryless property. By working through this conditional probability problem, you will see how this property allows us to \"reset the clock,\" dramatically simplifying what might otherwise be a very complicated calculation.", "problem": "A deep-space probe's primary communication system relies on two identical, independent signal amplifiers working in a redundant configuration. The system remains operational as long as at least one of the two amplifiers is functioning. The lifetime of each amplifier, measured in years, is an independent random variable that follows an exponential distribution with a rate parameter $\\lambda$ per year.\n\nA routine diagnostic is performed exactly 2 years into the mission, and it confirms that both amplifiers are still fully operational. Given this information, calculate the probability that the entire communication system will fail sometime before the probe reaches its 5-year operational milestone.\n\nProvide your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the rate parameter $\\lambda$.", "solution": "Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be the random variables representing the lifetimes of the two independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) amplifiers. According to the problem statement, $T_1, T_2 \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for an exponential random variable $T$ with rate $\\lambda$ is $F(t) = P(T \\le t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$, and the survival function is $S(t) = P(T > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\n\nThe communication system is redundant and fails only when both amplifiers have failed. Therefore, the lifetime of the entire system, $T_{sys}$, is the maximum of the two individual lifetimes: $T_{sys} = \\max(T_1, T_2)$.\n\nWe are given an event that serves as our condition: at the 2-year mark, both amplifiers were functional. Let's call this event $B$. This means that both $T_1 > 2$ and $T_2 > 2$. This is mathematically equivalent to the condition that the minimum of the two lifetimes is greater than 2: $B = \\{\\min(T_1, T_2) > 2\\}$.\n\nWe need to find the probability of another event, let's call it $A$: the entire system fails before the 5-year mark. This means $T_{sys} < 5$, which is equivalent to $A = \\{\\max(T_1, T_2) < 5\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the conditional probability $P(A|B) = P(\\max(T_1, T_2) < 5 | \\min(T_1, T_2) > 2)$.\n\nA key feature of the exponential distribution is its memoryless property, which states that for any $s, t \\ge 0$, $P(T > t+s | T > t) = P(T > s)$. This property implies that if a component has survived for time $t$, the distribution of its remaining lifetime is the same as the original distribution of its lifetime.\n\nLet's apply this property to our problem. The condition is that both amplifiers have survived for 2 years. Let's define the remaining lifetimes of the amplifiers after the 2-year mark as $T'_1 = T_1 - 2$ and $T'_2 = T_2 - 2$. Given that $T_1 > 2$ and $T_2 > 2$, the memoryless property tells us that $T'_1$ and $T'_2$ are also i.i.d. random variables following the same exponential distribution, i.e., $T'_1, T'_2 \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$.\n\nNow, we can rephrase the event $A = \\{\\max(T_1, T_2) < 5\\}$ in terms of these new variables. Substituting $T_1 = T'_1 + 2$ and $T_2 = T'_2 + 2$, we get:\n$\\max(T'_1 + 2, T'_2 + 2) < 5$\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\max(T'_1, T'_2) + 2 < 5$\n$\\max(T'_1, T'_2) < 3$\n\nSo, the original conditional probability is equivalent to the unconditional probability of this new event for the remaining lifetimes:\n$P(\\max(T_1, T_2) < 5 | \\min(T_1, T_2) > 2) = P(\\max(T'_1, T'_2) < 3)$.\n\nThe event $\\max(T'_1, T'_2) < 3$ occurs if and only if both $T'_1 < 3$ and $T'_2 < 3$.\n$P(\\max(T'_1, T'_2) < 3) = P(T'_1 < 3 \\text{ and } T'_2 < 3)$.\n\nSince $T'_1$ and $T'_2$ are independent, we can write this as the product of their individual probabilities:\n$P(T'_1 < 3 \\text{ and } T'_2 < 3) = P(T'_1 < 3) \\cdot P(T'_2 < 3)$.\n\nThe probability $P(T' < 3)$ is given by the CDF of the exponential distribution evaluated at $t=3$.\n$P(T' < 3) = F(3) = 1 - \\exp(-3\\lambda)$.\n\nSince $T'_1$ and $T'_2$ are identically distributed, we have:\n$P(T'_1 < 3) = P(T'_2 < 3) = 1 - \\exp(-3\\lambda)$.\n\nTherefore, the final probability is:\n$P(\\max(T'_1, T'_2) < 3) = (1 - \\exp(-3\\lambda)) \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-3\\lambda)) = (1 - \\exp(-3\\lambda))^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1 - \\exp(-3\\lambda))^{2}}$$", "id": "1302086"}]}
