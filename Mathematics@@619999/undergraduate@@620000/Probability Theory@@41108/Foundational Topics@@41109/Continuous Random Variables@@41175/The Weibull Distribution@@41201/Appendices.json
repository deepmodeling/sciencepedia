A common choice for this model is the Weibull distribution, which is flexible enough to describe various types of component failure.\n\nLet the random variable $T$ represent the lifetime of such a component, measured in thousands of hours. The reliability or survival function, $S(t)$, gives the probability that the component lasts longer than time $t$. For a Weibull distribution, this is given by:\n$$S(t) = P(T > t) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k}\\right)$$\nwhere $t \\geq 0$, $\\lambda > 0$ is the scale parameter (characteristic life), and $k > 0$ is the shape parameter.

Suppose we have a drive that is known to have already functioned for a time $s > 0$.
