Let's test this with a counterexample. Consider a set $X = \\{a, b\\}$ equipped with the indiscrete (or trivial) topology, $\\tau = \\{\\emptyset, X\\}$. This space is not a $T_1$ space because the only open set containing $a$ is $X$, which also contains $b$. Let $A = X = \\{a, b\\}$. To check if $A$ has isolated points, we examine each point. For the point $a$, the only open set $U$ in $X$ containing $a$ is $U=X$. The intersection is $U \\cap A = X \\cap X = X = \\{a, b\\}$, which is not $\\{a\\}$. Thus, $a$ is not an isolated point of $A$. By symmetry, $b$ is also not an isolated point of $A$. So, $A$ has no isolated points. Now, let $F = \\{b\\}$ be a non-empty finite subset of $A$. The resulting set is $A \\setminus F = \\{a\\}$. By definition, the point $a$ is an isolated point of the set $\\{a\\}$ because we can choose the open set $U=X$ and see that $U \\cap (A \\setminus F) = X \\cap \\{a\\} = \\{a\\}$. Therefore, $A \\setminus F$ has an isolated point. This provides a counterexample, so statement A is false. The $T_1$ condition is necessary.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B:**\nThis statement claims the property holds in a $T_1$ space. Let's prove it.\nLet $X$ be a $T_1$ space, and let $A \\subseteq X$ be a set with no isolated points. Let $F=\\{f_1, f_2, ..., f_n\\}$ be a finite subset of $A$. Let $Y = A \\setminus F$. We want to show that $Y$ has no isolated points.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $Y$ has an isolated point $p$. By definition, this means $p \\in Y$ and there exists an open set $U$ in $X$ such that $U \\cap Y = \\{p\\}$.\nSince $p \\in Y$, we know $p \\in A$ and $p \\notin F$.\nThe space $X$ is a $T_1$ space. This means that for any two distinct points $x,y$, there is an open set containing $x$ but not $y$. A key consequence is that finite sets are closed. Alternatively, for our point $p$ and each point $f_i \\in F$ (where $p \\neq f_i$), there exists an open set $V_i$ such that $p \\in V_i$ but $f_i \\notin V_i$.\nLet's construct a new open set. Define $V = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} V_i$. Since $F$ is finite, this is a finite intersection of open sets, which is itself an open set. By construction, $p \\in V$ (since $p$ is in every $V_i$), and for every $f_i \\in F$, $f_i \\notin V$. This implies that $V \\cap F = \\emptyset$.\nNow, consider the set $W = U \\cap V$. Since both $U$ and $V$ are open, $W$ is also an open set. Furthermore, since $p \\in U$ and $p \\in V$, we have $p \\in W$.\nLet's examine the intersection of $W$ with the original set $A$.\n$$W \\cap A = (U \\cap V) \\cap A = V \\cap (U \\cap A)$$\nWe know $A = Y \\cup F$, so $U \\cap A = U \\cap (Y \\cup F) = (U \\cap Y) \\cup (U \\cap F)$.\nFrom our assumption, $U \\cap Y = \\{p\\}$. Thus, $U \\cap A = \\{p\\} \\cup (U \\cap F)$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$W \\cap A = V \\cap (\\{p\\} \\cup (U \\cap F)) = (V \\cap \\{p\\}) \\cup (V \\cap U \\cap F)$$\nSince $p \\in V$, we have $V \\cap \\{p\\} = \\{p\\}$.\nSince $V \\cap F = \\emptyset$, it follows that the subset $V \\cap U \\cap F$ is also empty.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$W \\cap A = \\{p\\} \\cup \\emptyset = \\{p\\}$$\nWe have found an open set $W$ in $X$ such that $p \\in A$ and $W \\cap A = \\{p\\}$. This is the definition of $p$ being an isolated point of $A$.\nThis contradicts our initial premise that the set $A$ has no isolated points.\nThus, our assumption that $Y = A \\setminus F$ has an isolated point must be false.\nThis proves that $A \\setminus F$ has no isolated points. So, statement B is true.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C:**\nThis statement suggests the property only holds if $A$ is closed. Let's find a counterexample. Let $X = \\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology (which is a $T_1$ space). Let $A = (0, 1)$, the open interval. $A$ is not a closed set. For any $p \\in (0,1)$, any open neighborhood of $p$ will contain other points of $(0,1)$, so $A$ has no isolated points. Let $F = \\{1/2\\}$, a finite subset of $A$. The set $A \\setminus F = (0, 1/2) \\cup (1/2, 1)$. This new set also clearly has no isolated points. The property held even though $A$ was not closed. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D:**\nThis statement claims that a set having no isolated points is equivalent to being infinite. We need to check both directions of the equivalence.\n1. If a set $A$ has no isolated points, must it be infinite? If $A$ were finite, say $A = \\{a_1, ..., a_n\\}$, then in a $T_1$ space each singleton $\\{a_i\\}$ is closed. The set $A \\setminus \\{a_i\\}$ would be a finite union of closed sets, hence closed. Its complement $X \\setminus (A \\setminus \\{a_i\\})$ would be open. This open set contains $a_i$. Let $U_i = X \\setminus (A \\setminus \\{a_i\\})$. Then $U_i \\cap A = \\{a_i\\}$, making $a_i$ an isolated point. Thus, any finite set in a $T_1$ space consists entirely of isolated points. So, a set with no isolated points must be infinite. This direction is true.\n2. If a set $A$ is infinite, must it have no isolated points? Consider $X=\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology and let $A = \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. $A$ is an infinite set. However, for any point $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the open set $U = (n-1/2, n+1/2)$ intersects $A$ only at $\\{n\\}$. So every point in $\\mathbb{N}$ is an isolated point. This shows that an infinite set can have isolated points.\nSince one direction of the equivalence fails, statement D is false.\n\n**Analysis of Statement E:**\nThis statement claims the property extends to removing a countably infinite set. Let's find a counterexample. Let $X = \\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology. Let $A = \\mathbb{Q}$, the set of rational numbers. The set $A$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ and dense-in-itself, so it has no isolated points. Now, let $F$ be the set of all rational numbers except for the number 3. This means $F = \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\{3\\}$. $F$ is a countably infinite subset of $A$. Then the resulting set is $A \\setminus F = \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus (\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\{3\\}) = \\{3\\}$. The set $\\{3\\}$ consists of a single point, which is by definition an isolated point of itself. Thus, removing a countably infinite set from a set with no isolated points can result in a set that has an isolated point. Therefore, statement E is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement B is guaranteed to be true.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1560212"}]}
