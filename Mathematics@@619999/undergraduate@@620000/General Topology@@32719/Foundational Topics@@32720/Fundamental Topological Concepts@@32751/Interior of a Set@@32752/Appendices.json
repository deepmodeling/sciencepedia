The set $A$ is given by $A = \\left( (0, 4) \\cap \\mathbb{Q} \\right) \\cup (1, 3)$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the interior of $A$, denoted $\\text{int}(A)$.\nThe interior of a set is the largest open set contained within it. The set $A$ is a union of two sets: $S_1 = (0, 4) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ and $S_2 = (1, 3)$.\nThe interior of $S_1$ is the empty set, $\\text{int}(S_1) = \\emptyset$. This is because any non-empty open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ must contain irrational numbers, so no such interval can be a subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and therefore cannot be a subset of $S_1$.\nThe set $S_2 = (1, 3)$ is an open interval, so it is an open set.
