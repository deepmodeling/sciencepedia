Let $p = (x_0, y_0)$ be a point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $N \\in \\mathcal{B}(p)$, so $N = C(p, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon  0$.\nThe axiom states we must find some $M \\in \\mathcal{B}(p)$, so let's pick a candidate $M = C(p, \\delta)$ for some $\\delta  0$. For the axiom to hold, we must be able to find such a $\\delta$. Let's assume, without loss of generality, that $\\delta \\le \\epsilon$.\nNow we must check if for *every* point $q \\in M$, we can find a neighborhood $W \\in \\mathcal{B}(q)$ such that $W \\subseteq N$.\nLet's pick a point $q \\in M$ that is not $p$. For example, choose $q = (x_0, y_0 + \\delta)$. This point lies on the upper vertical arm of the cross $M=C(p,\\delta)$, so $q \\in M$. Note that $q \\neq p$ since $\\delta  0$.\nNow we need to find a set $W \\in \\mathcal{B}(q)$ such that $W \\subseteq N$. A generic element $W$ in $\\mathcal{B}(q)$ is of the form $C(q, \\eta)$ for some $\\eta  0$.\nLet's analyze the set $W = C(q, \\eta) = C((x_0, y_0+\\delta), \\eta)$.\n$W = (\\{x_0\\} \\times [y_0 + \\delta - \\eta, y_0 + \\delta + \\eta]) \\cup ([x_0 - \\eta, x_0 + \\eta] \\times \\{y_0 + \\delta\\})$.\nFor the condition $W \\subseteq N$ to hold, every point of $W$ must be in $N = C(p, \\epsilon)$.\nLet's consider the horizontal arm of $W$. This is the set $H_W = [x_0 - \\eta, x_0 + \\eta] \\times \\{y_0 + \\delta\\}$.\nLet's pick a point in $H_W$ other than its center, for example, $q' = (x_0 + \\frac{\\eta}{2}, y_0 + \\delta)$. Note that since $\\eta  0$, this point is well-defined and is in $H_W$, and thus in $W$.\nFor $W \\subseteq N$ to be true, $q'$ must be in $N = C((x_0, y_0), \\epsilon)$.\n$N = (\\{x_0\\} \\times [y_0 - \\epsilon, y_0 + \\epsilon]) \\cup ([x_0 - \\epsilon, x_0 + \\epsilon] \\times \\{y_0\\})$.\nFor the point $q'=(x_0 + \\frac{\\eta}{2}, y_0 + \\delta)$ to be in $N$, its coordinates must satisfy one of the following conditions:\n1. $x_0 + \\frac{\\eta}{2} = x_0$, which implies $\\eta = 0$.\n2. $y_0 + \\delta = y_0$, which implies $\\delta = 0$.\nHowever, the definitions of our neighborhood bases require $\\eta  0$ and $\\delta  0$. Thus, neither condition can be met. The point $q'$ is not in $N$.\nThis means that $W$ is not a subset of $N$. This reasoning holds for any choice of $\\eta  0$.\nThus, for the point $q = (x_0, y_0 + \\delta) \\in M$, it is impossible to find any neighborhood $W \\in \\mathcal{B}(q)$ that is a subset of $N$.\nSince we have found a point $q \\in M$ for which the condition fails, the axiom (D) does not hold for our choice of $M$. This argument is independent of the choice of $\\delta  0$. No matter how small we make $\\delta$, we can always pick a point $q$ on one of the arms of $M=C(p,\\delta)$ and show that none of its neighborhoods $C(q,\\eta)$ are contained in $N=C(p,\\epsilon)$. Therefore, axiom (D) fails.\n\nConclusion: Axioms (A), (B), and (C) hold, while axiom (D) fails.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1571460"}]}
