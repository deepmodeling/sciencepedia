A succinct way to see this is to note that if such a path existed, its image would be a compact, connected, locally connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ (as it is the continuous image of $[0,1]$), containing a point $(0,y_{0})$ with $y_{0}\\in[-1,1]$ and also containing points with $x>0$. But then, by continuity of the projection to the $x$-coordinate and the fact that for each $x>0$ the only point of $B$ with that $x$-coordinate is $(x,\\sin(1/x))$, the image would have to contain all points $(x,\\sin(1/x))$ for $x$ in some interval $(0,a]$, together with $(0,y_{0})$.
