By definition of the collection $\\mathcal{B}$, a set $B$ is of the form $D_n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^*$. So we need to find an $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^*$ such that $x \\in D_n$.\nThe condition $x \\in D_n$ means that $n$ divides $x$.\nFor any given non-zero integer $x$, we can choose $n=x$. Since $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^*$, this choice for $n$ is a non-zero integer, so $D_x$ is a valid set in the collection $\\mathcal{B}$.\nEvery non-zero integer divides itself (since $x = 1 \\cdot x$), so $x$ is a multiple of $x$. This means $x \\in D_x$.\nSince we can find such a set for any arbitrary $x \\in X$, the Covering Axiom is satisfied. This conclusion eliminates options (B) and (D).\n\nNext, we check the Intersection Axiom.\nThis axiom requires that for any two sets $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ and any point $x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$, there must exist a set $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$.\nLet $B_1 = D_{n_1}$ and $B_2 = D_{n_2}$ be two arbitrary sets from $\\mathcal{B}$, where $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^*$.\nLet $x$ be an arbitrary element in their intersection, $x \\in D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2}$.\nBy the definition of these sets, $x \\in D_{n_1}$ means $n_1$ divides $x$, and $x \\in D_{n_2}$ means $n_2$ divides $x$.\nSo, $x$ is a common multiple of $n_1$ and $n_2$.\nThe set of all integers that are common multiples of $n_1$ and $n_2$ is precisely the set of all integer multiples of their least common multiple. Let $L = \\text{lcm}(|n_1|, |n_2|)$, where the least common multiple is conventionally a positive integer.\nSince $n_1, n_2$ are non-zero integers, $|n_1| \\ge 1$ and $|n_2| \\ge 1$, which ensures that $L$ is a well-defined positive integer. Thus, $L \\in \\mathbb{Z}^*$.\nAn integer $k$ is divisible by both $n_1$ and $n_2$ if and only if it is divisible by $L$.\nTherefore, the intersection of the two sets is $D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2} = \\{ k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^* : L \\text{ divides } k \\}$, which is exactly the set $D_L$.\nNow, we must find a set $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that for our chosen $x$, we have $x \\in B_3 \\subseteq D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2}$.\nLet's choose $B_3 = D_L$. Since $L \\in \\mathbb{Z}^*$, $D_L$ is a valid member of the collection $\\mathcal{B}$.\nSince $x \\in D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2}$, we know $x$ is a common multiple of $n_1$ and $n_2$, which means $x$ is a multiple of $L$. Therefore, $x \\in D_L = B_3$.\nFurthermore, since $D_L$ is the intersection $D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2}$, the condition $B_3 \\subseteq D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2}$ is satisfied (in this case, with equality).\nSince we have found a suitable set $B_3$ for any arbitrary choices of $B_1, B_2$ and $x$, the Intersection Axiom is satisfied.
