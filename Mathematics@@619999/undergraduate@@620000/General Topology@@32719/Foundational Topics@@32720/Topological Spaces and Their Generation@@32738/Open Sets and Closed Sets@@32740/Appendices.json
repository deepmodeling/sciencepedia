All the given options are non-trivial subsets of $X$, so we only need to check the clopen property.\n\nLet's recall the definitions for the space $X$:\n1.  **Open Set**: A subset $A \\subseteq X$ is open if for every $x \\in A$, there exists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the set of points in $X$ within distance $\\epsilon$ of $x$, i.e., $\\{y \\in X : |x-y| < \\epsilon\\}$, is contained entirely within $A$.\n2.  **Closed Set**: A subset $C \\subseteq X$ is closed if its complement relative to $X$, which is $X \\setminus C$, is an open set in $X$.\n3.  **Clopen Set**: A subset is clopen if it is both open and closed.\n\nWe will now examine each option:\n\n**A. $S_A = \\{x \\in X \\mid x \\text{ is a rational number}\\}$**\nTo check if $S_A$ is open, consider any rational number $q \\in S_A$. The neighborhood of $q$ in $X$ is of the form $\\{y \\in X : |q-y| < \\epsilon\\}$. Because the irrational numbers are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, any such neighborhood, no matter how small $\\epsilon$ is, will contain irrational numbers. These irrational numbers are in $X$ but not in $S_A$. Thus, the neighborhood is not a subset of $S_A$. Therefore, $S_A$ is not open.\nTo check if $S_A$ is closed, we examine its complement, $X \\setminus S_A$, which is the set of irrational numbers in $X$. Consider any irrational number $p \\in X \\setminus S_A$. The neighborhood of $p$ in $X$ is $\\{y \\in X : |p-y| < \\epsilon\\}$. Because the rational numbers are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, this neighborhood will contain rational numbers. These rational numbers are not in $X \\setminus S_A$. Thus, the neighborhood is not a subset of $X \\setminus S_A$, which means the complement is not open. Therefore, $S_A$ is not closed.\nSince $S_A$ is neither open nor closed, it is not clopen.\n\n**B. $S_B = (0, 1/2)$**\nTo check if $S_B$ is open, let $x \\in S_B$. We can choose $\\epsilon = \\min(x, 1/2 - x)$, which is positive. The interval $(x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon)$ is a subset of $(0, 1/2)$. The neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ is $\\{y \\in X : |x-y| < \\epsilon\\} = (x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon) \\subset S_B$. Thus, $S_B$ is open.\nTo check if $S_B$ is closed, we examine its complement, $X \\setminus S_B = [1/2, 1) \\cup (2,3)$. We test if this complement is open. Consider the point $x=1/2$, which is in the complement. Any neighborhood of $1/2$ in $X$ is of the form $\\{y \\in X : |1/2-y| < \\epsilon\\} = (1/2-\\epsilon, 1/2+\\epsilon) \\cap (0,1)$. This neighborhood contains points less than $1/2$, such as $1/2 - \\epsilon/2$, which are not in $X \\setminus S_B$. So, $X \\setminus S_B$ is not open. Therefore, $S_B$ is not closed.\nSince $S_B$ is not closed, it is not clopen.\n\n**C. $S_C = (2,3)$**\nTo check if $S_C$ is open, let $x \\in S_C$. We can choose $\\epsilon = \\min(x-2, 3-x)$. Then the interval $(x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon)$ is a subset of $(2,3)$. The neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ is $\\{y \\in X : |x-y| < \\epsilon\\} = (x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon) \\subset S_C$. Thus, $S_C$ is open.\nTo check if $S_C$ is closed, we examine its complement, $X \\setminus S_C = (0,1)$. We must determine if $(0,1)$ is open in $X$. Let $x \\in (0,1)$. We can choose $\\epsilon = \\min(x, 1-x)$. The neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ is $\\{y \\in X : |x-y| < \\epsilon\\} = (x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon) \\subset (0,1)$. So the complement $X \\setminus S_C$ is open. This means $S_C$ is closed.\nSince $S_C$ is both open and closed, it is a clopen subset. It is also non-trivial. This is the correct answer.\n\n**D. $S_D = (0, 1/2] \\cup (2, 5/2]$**\nTo check if $S_D$ is open, consider the point $x=1/2 \\in S_D$. Any neighborhood of $1/2$ in $X$ is of the form $(1/2-\\epsilon, 1/2+\\epsilon) \\cap (0,1)$. This neighborhood contains points greater than 1/2, which are not in $S_D$. Therefore, $S_D$ is not open. Since it is not open, it cannot be clopen.\n\n**E. $S_E = \\{1/2, 5/2\\}$**\nTo check if $S_E$ is open, consider the point $x=1/2 \\in S_E$. Any neighborhood of $1/2$ in $X$ is an interval of the form $(1/2-\\epsilon, 1/2+\\epsilon) \\cap (0,1)$, which contains infinitely many points. This neighborhood cannot be a subset of $S_E$, which only contains two points. Therefore, $S_E$ is not open.
