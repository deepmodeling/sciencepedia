(Equivalently, the union of all sets in the collection $\\mathcal{B}$ must be equal to $X$).\n2.  **Intersection Axiom:** For any two sets $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ and for any element $x$ in their intersection ($x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$), there must exist a set $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B_3$ and $B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$.\n\nWe will now check these two axioms for each of the four given collections.\n\n**A. The collection of all non-empty subsets of $X$.**\nLet this collection be $\\mathcal{C}_A = \\mathcal{P}(X) \\setminus \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\n1.  **Covering Axiom:** For any element $x \\in X$, the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is a non-empty subset of $X$. Thus, $\\{x\\} \\in \\mathcal{C}_A$ and $x \\in \\{x\\}$. The axiom is satisfied.\n2.  **Intersection Axiom:** Let $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_A$. If their intersection $B_1 \\cap B_2$ is empty, the axiom is vacuously true for this pair. If $B_1 \\cap B_2$ is non-empty, then it is a non-empty subset of $X$, which means $B_1 \\cap B_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_A$. For any $x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$, we can choose $B_3 = B_1 \\cap B_2$. Then $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{C}_A$, and we have $x \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. The axiom is satisfied.\nSince both axioms hold, collection A is a basis for a topology on $X$ (specifically, the discrete topology).\n\n**B. The collection of all subsets of $X$ with cardinality 2.**\nLet this collection be $\\mathcal{C}_B = \\{S \\subseteq X \\mid |S| = 2\\}$.\nFor example, $\\{a,b\\}$ and $\\{a,c\\}$ are in $\\mathcal{C}_B$.\n1.  **Covering Axiom:** For any element $x \\in X$, we can find another element $y \\in X$ (since $|X|=4 > 1$). The set $\\{x,y\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{C}_B$ and contains $x$. The axiom is satisfied.\n2.  **Intersection Axiom:** Consider $B_1 = \\{a, b\\} \\in \\mathcal{C}_B$ and $B_2 = \\{a, c\\} \\in \\mathcal{C}_B$. Their intersection is $B_1 \\cap B_2 = \\{a\\}$. Let $x=a$. According to the axiom, there must be a set $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{C}_B$ such that $a \\in B_3$ and $B_3 \\subseteq \\{a\\}$. The only non-empty subset of $\\{a\\}$ is $\\{a\\}$ itself. So we would need $B_3 = \\{a\\}$. However, all sets in $\\mathcal{C}_B$ must have cardinality 2. The set $\\{a\\}$ has cardinality 1, so $\\{a\\} \\notin \\mathcal{C}_B$. No such set $B_3$ exists. The axiom is not satisfied.\nSince the intersection axiom fails, collection B is not a basis.\n\n**C. The collection of all subsets of $X$ that contain the element $a$.**\nLet this collection be $\\mathcal{C}_C = \\{S \\subseteq X \\mid a \\in S\\}$.\n1.  **Covering Axiom:** For the element $a$, the set $\\{a\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{C}_C$. For any other element $x \\in \\{b,c,d\\}$, the set $\\{a,x\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{C}_C$ and contains $x$. Thus, every element of $X$ is in at least one set in $\\mathcal{C}_C$. The axiom is satisfied.\n2.  **Intersection Axiom:** Let $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_C$. By definition of $\\mathcal{C}_C$, we have $a \\in B_1$ and $a \\in B_2$. Therefore, $a \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$. This implies that the intersection $B_1 \\cap B_2$ is a subset of $X$ that contains $a$, so $B_1 \\cap B_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_C$. For any $x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$, we can choose $B_3 = B_1 \\cap B_2$. We have $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{C}_C$ and $x \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. The axiom is satisfied.\nSince both axioms hold, collection C is a basis for a topology on $X$ (the particular point topology for point $a$).\n\n**D. The collection of all subsets of $X$ with odd cardinality.**\nLet this collection be $\\mathcal{C}_D = \\{S \\subseteq X \\mid |S|=1 \\text{ or } |S|=3\\}$.\n1.  **Covering Axiom:** For any $x \\in X$, the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ has cardinality 1, which is odd. Therefore, $\\{x\\} \\in \\mathcal{C}_D$, and $x \\in \\{x\\}$. The axiom is satisfied.\n2.  **Intersection Axiom:** Let $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_D$ and let $x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$. We need to find a set $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{C}_D$ such that $x \\in B_3 \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. Consider the singleton set $B_3 = \\{x\\}$. The cardinality of $B_3$ is 1, which is odd, so $B_3 \\in \\mathcal{C}_D$. By construction, $x \\in B_3$. Since we started with $x \\in B_1 \\cap B_2$, it follows that $\\{x\\} \\subseteq B_1 \\cap B_2$. So we have found a suitable set $B_3 = \\{x\\}$ that satisfies the condition for any choice of $B_1, B_2$ and $x$. The axiom is satisfied.\nSince both axioms hold, collection D is a basis for a topology on $X$.\n\nIn summary, collections A, C, and D are bases for a topology on $X$, while collection B is not.
