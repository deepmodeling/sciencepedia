Next, we verify closure under finite intersections. For any $m,n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the intersection $D_{m}\\cap D_{n}$ is the set of positive integers that divide both $m$ and $n$, which is precisely the set of divisors of their greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(m,n)$.

If $k$ is a multiple of 6, then 6 must be a divisor of $k$, so $6 \\in D_k$. However, $6 \\notin \\{1,2,3\\}$. This is a contradiction. Thus, $D_{2}\\cup D_{3}$ is not in $\\mathcal{T}$. Since we have found a union of two sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ that is not in $\\mathcal{T}$, the collection is not closed under arbitrary unions, and axiom (ii) fails.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{T}$ does not form a topology on $\\mathbb{N}$.

Thus, $V \\subseteq U_a$.\n  Conversely, if $f \\in U_a$, then $f(0) > a$. Let $\\epsilon = f(0) - a > 0$. By the definition of an infimum, there must exist some $c \\in S$ such that $c  a + \\epsilon = f(0)$. This means $f \\in U_c$, and therefore $f \\in V$.

Since $S$ is unbounded below, there must exist some $c \\in S$ such that $c  f(0)$. This implies $f \\in U_c$, and therefore $f \\in V$.
