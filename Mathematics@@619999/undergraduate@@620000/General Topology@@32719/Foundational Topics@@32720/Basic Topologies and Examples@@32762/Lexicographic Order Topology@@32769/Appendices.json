Fix $p=(x,y)$ with $0<y<\\frac{1}{2}$. Choose $y_{-}, y_{+}$ with $0<y_{-}<y<y_{+}<\\frac{1}{2}$ and set $u=(x,y_{-})$ and $v=(x,y_{+})$. The basic open interval $(u,v)$ consists of points $(z,t)$ where $u<_{L}(z,t)<_{L}v$. This implies that $z=x$ and $y_{-}<t<y_{+}$. Since $y_{+}<\\frac{1}{2}$, all such points are in $A$.

If $v$ has a first coordinate $x'>x$, then the point $(x,1)$ satisfies $p <_L (x,1) <_L v$. So $(x,1) \\in U$, but $(x,1) \\notin A$. This is also a contradiction.

Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$. By the definition of the basis for the order topology, there exists a basis element $B$ such that $p \\in B \\subseteq U$. A basis element containing $p$ is an open interval of points in $X$. Let's denote this interval as $((a,b), (c,d))$. Thus, $(a,b) < (x,y) < (c,d)$. (This form needs to be slightly adjusted if $p$ is an endpoint of $X$, but the logic remains similar).\n\nFrom $(a,b) < (x,y)$, we have $a \\le x$.\nFrom $(x,y) < (c,d)$, we have $x \\le c$.\n\nWe need to show that the interval $((a,b), (c,d))$ contains a point from $S$.\nLet's consider two sub-cases.\n\nSub-case 1.1: $a < x$.\nSince the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers, we can find a rational number $q_1$ such that $a < q_1 < x$. Let $q_2$ be any rational number in $[0,1]$, for instance, $q_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then the point $p' = (q_1, q_2)$ is in $S$. We check if $p'$ lies in the interval $((a,b),(c,d))$.\nSince $a < q_1$, we have $(a,b) < (q_1, q_2)$.\nSince $q_1 < x$, we have $(q_1, q_2) < (x,y)$.\nThus, $(a,b) < p' < (x,y) < (c,d)$, which means $p' \\in ((a,b), (c,d))$. So the neighborhood $U$ contains a point from $S$.\n\nSub-case 1.2: $a = x$.\nIn this case, the condition $(a,b) < (x,y)$ becomes $(x,b) < (x,y)$, which implies $b < y$. (This sub-case is not possible if $y=0$, but then we must have $a<x$ unless $p$ is the minimal element $(0,0)$, which is in $S$ anyway). Since $y > b$ and the rationals are dense, we can choose a rational number $q_2$ such that $b < q_2 < y$.\nConsider the point $p' = (x, q_2)$. Since $x$ is rational (by our case assumption) and $q_2$ is rational, $p' \\in S$.\nWe check if $p'$ lies in the interval $((a,b),(c,d)) = ((x,b),(c,d))$.\nSince $b < q_2$, we have $(x,b) < (x,q_2)$.\nSince $q_2 < y$, we have $(x,q_2) < (x,y)$.\nThus, $(x,b) < p' < (x,y) < (c,d)$, which means $p' \\in ((x,b), (c,d))$. So the neighborhood $U$ contains a point from $S$.\n\nA similar argument holds if $(x,y)<(c,d)$ implies $x<c$ or $x=c$. If $x<c$, we find a rational between them. If $x=c$, then $y<d$, and we find a rational between $y$ and $d$. The special cases for endpoints of $X$ like $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ also satisfy the condition (e.g., $(0,0)$ is in $S$).\nTherefore, every point $(x,y)$ with a rational first coordinate $x$ is in the closure of $S$. This means the set $\\mathbb{Q}_{[0,1]} \\times [0,1]$ is a subset of $\\text{Cl}(S)$.\n\n**Case 2: $x$ is an irrational number ($x \\in \\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]}$)**\n\nLet $p=(x,y)$ be a point in $X$ where $x$ is irrational.\n\nSub-case 2.1: $y \\in (0,1)$.\nConsider the open interval $U = ((x,0), (x,1))$. By definition of the lexicographic order, a point $(u,v) \\in X$ is in $U$ if and only if $(x,0) < (u,v) < (x,1)$. This implies $u$ must be equal to $x$. So, $U = \\{x\\} \\times (0,1)$. The point $p=(x,y)$ is in this set $U$.\nEvery point in $U$ has an irrational first coordinate $x$. The set $S$ only contains points with rational coordinates. Therefore, $U \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\nSince we found an open neighborhood of $p$ that does not intersect $S$, the point $p=(x,y)$ with $x$ irrational and $y \\in (0,1)$ is not in the closure of $S$.\n\nSub-case 2.2: $y=0$.\nLet $p=(x,0)$ with $x$ irrational. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$. Then $U$ contains a basis interval of the form $((a,b), (c,d))$ containing $p$. For $(a,b) < (x,0)$, it must be that $a < x$.\nSince the rationals are dense in the reals, we can find a rational number $q_1$ such that $a < q_1 < x$. Let $q_2=\\frac{1}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The point $p'=(q_1,q_2)$ is in $S$.\nSince $a < q_1$, we have $(a,b) < (q_1, q_2)$. Since $q_1 < x$, we have $(q_1, q_2) < (x,0)$.\nSo, $(a,b) < p' < (x,0) < (c,d)$, implying $p' \\in U$.\nEvery neighborhood of $(x,0)$ intersects $S$, so $(x,0)$ is in the closure for irrational $x$.\n\nSub-case 2.3: $y=1$.\nLet $p=(x,1)$ with $x$ irrational. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$. Then $U$ contains a basis interval $((a,b), (c,d))$ containing $p$. For $(x,1) < (c,d)$, it must be that $x < c$.\nSince the rationals are dense, we can find a rational number $q_1$ such that $x < q_1 < c$. Let $q_2=\\frac{1}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The point $p'=(q_1,q_2)$ is in $S$.\nSince $q_1 > x$, we have $(x,1) < (q_1, q_2)$. Since $q_1 < c$, we have $(q_1, q_2) < (c,d)$.\nSo, $(a,b) < (x,1) < p' < (c,d)$, implying $p' \\in U$.\nEvery neighborhood of $(x,1)$ intersects $S$, so $(x,1)$ is in the closure for irrational $x$.\n\nFrom Case 2, we conclude that for an irrational $x$, the point $(x,y)$ is in $\\text{Cl}(S)$ if and only if $y=0$ or $y=1$. This gives the set $\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]} \\times \\{0,1\\}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the closure of $S$ is the union of the sets found:\n$\\text{Cl}(S) = (\\mathbb{Q}_{[0,1]} \\times [0,1]) \\cup (\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]} \\times \\{0,1\\})$.\nThis matches option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1561273"}, {"introduction": "To truly master a concept, it is helpful to explore its variations.
