For a monitoring scheme to be considered valid and self-consistent, it must satisfy three fundamental rules:\n1.

To be Hausdorff ($T_{2}$), for any distinct $x,y\\in X$ there must exist disjoint open sets $U,V\\in\\tau$ with $x\\in U$ and $y\\in V$. For $a$ and $b$, choose $U=\\{a\\}$ and $V=\\{b\\}$, which are disjoint. For $a$ and $c$, any open neighborhood of $c$ must be $X$, since the only open set containing $c$ is $X$. Thus no open set containing $c$ can be disjoint from any nonempty open set containing $a$. Hence the space is not Hausdorff. Statement I is false.\n\nII. A space is disconnected iff there exist disjoint nonempty open sets whose union is $X$, equivalently iff there exists a nontrivial clopen subset. The nonempty open sets are $\\{a\\}$, $\\{b\\}$, and $\\{a,b\\}$. The only disjoint pair $\\{a\\}$, $\\{b\\}$ has union $\\{a,b\\}\\neq X$, and any other pair intersects.

A space is path-connected if for any $x,y\\in X$ there exists a continuous map $f:[0,1]\\to X$ with $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$. Continuity requires that for each open set $O\\in\\tau$, $f^{-1}(O)$ is open in $[0,1]$. Since the only nontrivial open sets are $\\{a\\}$, $\\{b\\}$, and $\\{a,b\\}$, continuity reduces to $f^{-1}(\\{a\\})$ and $f^{-1}(\\{b\\})$ being open (and hence $f^{-1}(\\{a,b\\})=f^{-1}(\\{a\\})\\cup f^{-1}(\\{b\\})$ is open). Construct explicit paths:\n- From $a$ to $c$: define $f:[0,1]\\to X$ by $f(t)=a$ for $t\\in[0,1)$ and $f(1)=c$. Then $f^{-1}(\\{a\\})=[0,1)$ is open in $[0,1]$, $f^{-1}(\\{b\\})=\\emptyset$ is open, and $f^{-1}(\\{a,b\\})=[0,1)$ is open; thus $f$ is continuous with $f(0)=a$ and $f(1)=c$.\n- From $b$ to $c$: analogously, $g(t)=b$ for $t\\in[0,1)$ and $g(1)=c$ works.\n- From $a$ to $b$: define $h:[0,1]\\to X$ by $h(t)=a$ for $t\\in[0,\\frac{1}{2})$, $h(\\frac{1}{2})=c$, and $h(t)=b$ for $t\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1]$.

By symmetry, paths exist between any pair. Therefore $(X,\\tau)$ is path-connected. Statement III is true.\n\nIV. Every finite topological space is compact: given any open cover of a finite set $X$, one may select for each $x\\in X$ some open set from the cover containing $x$, yielding a finite subcover.
