We are interested in constructing a topology that is minimally more complex than the indiscrete topology. We say a topology $\\mathcal{T}_A$ is *finer* than a topology $\\mathcal{T}_B$ on the same set if every open set in $\\mathcal{T}_B$ is also an open set in $\\mathcal{T}_A$ (that is, $\\mathcal{T}_B \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_A$). If $\\mathcal{T}_A$ is finer than $\\mathcal{T}_B$ and $\\mathcal{T}_A \\neq \\mathcal{T}_B$, we say that $\\mathcal{T}_A$ is *strictly finer* than $\\mathcal{T}_B$.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible number of open sets in a topology $\\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ that is strictly finer than the indiscrete topology?", "solution": "Let $X$ be a non-empty set with at least two distinct elements. The indiscrete topology on $X$ is $\\{\\emptyset, X\\}$.\n\nAny topology $\\mathcal{T}$ strictly finer than the indiscrete topology must contain $\\emptyset$, $X$, and at least one additional subset $U \\subseteq X$ with $U \\neq \\emptyset$ and $U \\neq X$. Therefore, any strictly finer topology has at least $3$ open sets.\n\nIt remains to show that there exists a topology on $X$ with exactly $3$ open sets. Since $X$ has at least two elements, there exists a proper nonempty subset $U \\subset X$. Consider\n$$\n\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\emptyset, U, X\\}.\n$$\nWe verify the topology axioms:\n1. $\\emptyset, X \\in \\mathcal{T}$ by construction.\n2.
