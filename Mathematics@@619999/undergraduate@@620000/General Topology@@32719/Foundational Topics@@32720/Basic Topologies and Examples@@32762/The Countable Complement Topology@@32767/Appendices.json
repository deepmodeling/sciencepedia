An open neighborhood of $p \\in X$ is any $U = X \\setminus C$ where $C \\subset X$ is countable and $p \\notin C$. For a sequence $(x_{n})_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, define its range set $R := \\{x_{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, which is countable.\n\nWe first characterize limit points (cluster points) of sequences in $(X,\\mathcal{T}_{cc})$ under the given definition: $p$ is a limit point if and only if for every open $U \\ni p$, the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : x_{n} \\in U\\}$ is infinite.\n\nClaim: For any sequence $(x_{n})$, a point $p \\in X$ is a limit point if and only if $p$ occurs infinitely many times in the sequence, i.e., $|\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : x_{n} = p\\}| = \\infty$.\n\nProof of the claim:\n- Suppose $p$ is a limit point. Consider the open set\n$$\nU := X \\setminus \\bigl(R \\setminus \\{p\\}\\bigr).\n$$\nIts complement $R \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is countable and does not contain $p$, hence $U$ is an open neighborhood of $p$. Then\n$$\n\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : x_{n} \\in U\\} = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : x_{n} = p\\}.\n$$\nBy the definition of limit point, this set must be infinite. Hence $p$ appears infinitely often.\n- Conversely, suppose $p$ appears infinitely often. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$, so $U = X \\setminus C$ for some countable $C$ with $p \\notin C$. Then for every $n$ with $x_{n} = p$, we have $x_{n} \\in U$. Since there are infinitely many such $n$, it follows that $\\{n : x_{n} \\in U\\}$ is infinite. Thus $p$ is a limit point.\n\nAs a corollary, the set of limit points of any sequence is precisely\n$$\nL := \\{p \\in X : |\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : x_{n} = p\\}| = \\infty\\} \\subseteq R,\n$$\nhence it is at most countable.\n\nWe now analyze each statement:\n\nA. If $(q_{n})$ enumerates all rationals in $[0,1]$ (each exactly once), then for $p = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ we have $|\\{n : q_{n} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\}| = 1$, which is not infinite. Hence $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ is not even a limit point. Convergence to $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ (which requires eventual membership in every neighborhood) would force the sequence to be eventually constant equal to $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ by the same $U = X \\setminus (R \\setminus \\{p\\})$ argument, which it is not. Therefore A is false.\n\nB. If $(q_{n})$ enumerates all of $\\mathbb{Q}$, then for any irrational $p$ choose $U = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$, and the set $\\{n : q_{n} \\in U\\}$ is empty, so $p$ is not a limit point. For any rational $p$, since each rational occurs finitely many times in a standard enumeration (e.g., once), we have $|\\{n : q_{n} = p\\}| < \\infty$, so $p$ is not a limit point by the claim. Thus the set of limit points is empty, not $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore B is false.\n\nC. Consider $x_{n} = \\cos(n)$. If $\\cos(n) = \\cos(m)$ for integers $n,m$, then $n - m = 2k\\pi$ or $n + m = 2k\\pi$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $2\\pi \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, neither equality can hold unless $n = m$ or $n + m = 0$. For $n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $n + m = 0$ is impossible, so $\\cos(n) = \\cos(m)$ implies $n = m$. Hence all values $\\cos(n)$ are distinct, so no value occurs infinitely often. By the claim, there is no limit point. Therefore C is false.\n\nD. For any sequence, the set of limit points equals $L \\subseteq R$, where $R$ is countable. Hence the set of limit points is countable (possibly finite or empty).

If $x \\in A \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$, say $x = q_{k}$, then for any $n > k$, $q_{k} \\notin \\{q_{n}, q_{n+1}, \\dots\\}$, hence $q_{k} \\in U_{n}$.
