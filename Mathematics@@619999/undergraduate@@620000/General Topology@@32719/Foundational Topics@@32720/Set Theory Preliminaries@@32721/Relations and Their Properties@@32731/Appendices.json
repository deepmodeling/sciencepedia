A relation on $S$ is reflexive if and only if it contains all diagonal pairs.

A relation $R$ is transitive if for all $x,y,z\\in S$, $(x,y)\\in R$ and $(y,z)\\in R$ imply $(x,z)\\in R$. The minimal transitive superset of a relation is its transitive closure, which contains exactly all pairs $(x,y)$ such that there exists a directed path from $x$ to $y$ using edges in the relation.\n\nObserve that adding $\\Delta$ does not create any new directed paths between distinct elements, because each element only gains a self-loop.
