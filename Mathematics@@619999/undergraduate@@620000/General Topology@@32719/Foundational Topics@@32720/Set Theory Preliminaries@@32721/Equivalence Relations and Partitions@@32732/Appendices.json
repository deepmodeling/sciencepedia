An equivalence relation, denoted by $\\sim$, must satisfy three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. The smallest such relation is the equivalence closure of the initial set of pairs $R = \\{(S_1, S_3), (S_3, S_5)\\}$. We need to add the minimum number of pairs to $R$ to satisfy all three properties.\n\n1.  **Initial Pairs**: The relation must contain the pairs corresponding to the direct links, so $S_1 \\sim S_3$ and $S_3 \\sim S_5$.\n\n2.  **Reflexivity**: For any element $x \\in S$, we must have $x \\sim x$.
