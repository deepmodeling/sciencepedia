The complement of a closed disk in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is path-connected (it deformation retracts onto a circle). Therefore $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus A$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus B$ are path-connected. The complement of their union is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ minus two disjoint closed disks, which is still path-connected (one can join any two points by a path that goes around the disks).

The complement $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus A = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$ is the disjoint union of the open half-planes $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y>0\\}$ and $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y0\\}$, hence it is not path-connected.

This set is path-connected: any two points in the same half-plane can be connected within that half-plane; to connect a point in the half-plane where $y>0$ to one where $y0$, use a path in the $y>0$ half-plane approaching $(1,0)$, pass through the point $(1,0)$, and continue in the $y0$ half-plane. Continuity at the junction is ensured by defining the path to have limit $(1,0)$ at the joining parameter value.

Their intersection is $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y=0\\}$, the $x$-axis, which is path-connected. Hence condition 3 fails.\n\nOption E: Here $A$ and $B$ are the graphs of $y=\\exp(x)$ and $y=-\\exp(x)$, which are simple non-closed curves (each homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$). A standard corollary of the Jordan curve theorem implies that removing a simple non-closed curve from the plane does not disconnect it; thus each of $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus A$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus B$ is path-connected. The complement of the union $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus (A \\cup B)$ is also path-connected, since removing finitely many such simple non-closed curves does not separate the plane (no simple closed component is created).
