We need to determine if $F$ is injective and/or surjective.\n\nFirst, let's test for injectivity. A function $F$ is injective (or one-to-one) if for any two elements $a, b$ in its domain, $F(a) = F(b)$ implies $a = b$.\nLet $a = (a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots)$ and $b = (b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots)$ be two sequences in $S$. Suppose $F(a) = F(b)$.\nBy the definition of the function $F$, we have:\n$$F(a) = (0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots)$$\n$$F(b) = (0, b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots)$$\nThe condition $F(a) = F(b)$ means that the two output sequences are identical. Two sequences are identical if and only if their corresponding elements are equal.\n$$(0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots) = (0, b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots)$$\nComparing the elements at each position:\n- The first element gives $0 = 0$, which is consistent.\n- The second element gives $a_1 = b_1$.\n- The third element gives $a_2 = b_2$.\n- In general, for any integer $i \\ge 1$, comparing the $(i+1)$-th elements gives $a_i = b_i$.\nSince $a_i = b_i$ for all $i \\ge 1$, the sequences $a$ and $b$ are identical, i.e., $a = b$.\nTherefore, the condition $F(a) = F(b)$ implies $a = b$. This means the function $F$ is injective.\n\nNext, let's test for surjectivity. A function $F$ is surjective (or onto) if for every element $y$ in the codomain $S$, there exists at least one element $x$ in the domain $S$ such that $F(x) = y$.\nLet's consider an arbitrary target sequence $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3, \\ldots)$ in the codomain $S$. We want to see if we can find a sequence $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots)$ in the domain $S$ such that $F(x) = y$.\nFrom the definition of $F$, we know that $F(x) = (0, x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots)$.\nSo, for $F(x) = y$ to hold, we must have:\n$$(0, x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots) = (y_1, y_2, y_3, \\ldots)$$\nThis equality requires that the first element of the sequence $y$ must be $0$, i.e., $y_1 = 0$. If $y_1=0$, we can indeed find a suitable $x$ by setting $x_1 = y_2$, $x_2 = y_3$, and in general $x_i = y_{i+1}$ for all $i \\ge 1$. The sequence $x = (y_2, y_3, y_4, \\ldots)$ is a valid sequence in $S$ as it is an infinite sequence of real numbers.\n\nHowever, the condition for surjectivity is that *every* element in the codomain can be reached. The analysis above shows that only sequences starting with $0$ can be in the image of $F$. To prove that $F$ is not surjective, we just need to provide a single counterexample: an element in the codomain $S$ that is not in the image of $F$.\nConsider the sequence $y^* = (1, 1, 1, 1, \\ldots)$, which is an element of $S$.\nThe first element of $y^*$ is $y_1^* = 1$.\nFor any sequence $x \\in S$, the output $F(x)$ will always be a sequence whose first element is $0$. Since the first element of $y^*$ is $1 \\neq 0$, there is no sequence $x \\in S$ for which $F(x) = y^*$.\nSince we have found an element in the codomain $S$ that has no pre-image in the domain $S$, the function $F$ is not surjective.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $F$ is injective but not surjective.
