Instead, we use the powerful concept of a bijection—a one-to-one correspondence. This first practice provides a concrete application of this idea, asking you to work with an explicit function that proves the set of even integers and the set of odd integers have the same cardinality, or \"size\" [@problem_id:1554013].", "problem": "Let $E$ be the set of all even integers (e.g., ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...) and let $O$ be the set of all odd integers (e.g., ..., -3, -1, 1, 3, ...). Consider a function $f$ that maps each even integer $x$ to an odd integer according to the rule $f(x) = 1 - x$.

This exercise uses the intuitive framework of decimal expansions to demonstrate a profound difference in cardinality. By analyzing sets of numbers defined by the digits they are allowed to contain, you will discover how a seemingly small change in the construction rules can be the difference between a countable set and a vastly larger uncountable one [@problem_id:1299950].", "problem": "Consider the following three sets of real numbers in the interval $(0, 1)$:\n\n-   Let $S_1$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digit '1'.\n-   Let $S_2$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digits '1' and '2'.\n-   Let $S_3$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion is terminating (i.e., contains only a finite number of non-zero digits).\n\nWhich of these sets are uncountable?\n\nA. $S_1$ only\n\nB. $S_2$ only\n\nC. $S_3$ only\n\nD. $S_1$ and $S_2$\n\nE. $S_2$ and $S_3$\n\nF.
