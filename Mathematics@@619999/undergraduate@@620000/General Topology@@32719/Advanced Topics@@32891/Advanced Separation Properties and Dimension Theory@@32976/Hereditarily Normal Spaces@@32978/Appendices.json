A topological space is called **normal** if for any pair of disjoint closed sets $C_1$ and $C_2$, there exist disjoint open sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ such that $C_1 \\subseteq U_1$ and $C_2 \\subseteq U_2$.\n2.

By definition, closed sets are complements of open sets in $X$. Since the complements in $X$ of the listed open sets are $X$, $\\{b,c\\}$, $\\{a\\}$, and $\\emptyset$, respectively, the family of closed sets is exactly $\\{\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b,c\\},X\\}$.\n\nTo check normality of $(X,\\tau)$, we must verify that for any disjoint closed sets $C_{1},C_{2}$ there exist disjoint open sets $U_{1},U_{2}$ with $C_{1}\\subseteq U_{1}$ and $C_{2}\\subseteq U_{2}$. The only nontrivial pair of disjoint closed sets is $C_{1}=\\{a\\}$ and $C_{2}=\\{b,c\\}$. Choosing $U_{1}=\\{a\\}$ and $U_{2}=\\{b,c\\}$, which are open and disjoint, satisfies the requirement. All other pairs involve $\\emptyset$ and are trivially separable. Hence $(X,\\tau)$ is normal.\n\nTo decide hereditary normality, we examine all subspaces $Y\\subseteq X$ with the subspace topology.\n\n1. If $Y=\\emptyset$ or $|Y|=1$, then the only closed subsets are $\\emptyset$ and $Y$; any two disjoint closed sets are either both empty or one is empty, and the separation by open sets is immediate, so such $Y$ are normal.\n\n2. If $Y=\\{b,c\\}$, then the subspace topology consists of intersections of opens of $X$ with $Y$, namely\n$$\n\\emptyset\\cap Y=\\emptyset,\\quad \\{a\\}\\cap Y=\\emptyset,\\quad \\{b,c\\}\\cap Y=Y,\\quad X\\cap Y=Y,\n$$\nso the subspace topology on $Y$ is $\\{\\emptyset,Y\\}$, the indiscrete topology.

In a discrete space every subset is open (and closed), so given disjoint closed sets $C_{1},C_{2}\\subseteq Y$ one may take $U_{1}=C_{1}$ and $U_{2}=C_{2}$, which are open and disjoint, proving normality.\n\nThus every subspace of $(X,\\tau)$ is normal, so the space is hereditarily normal.

Also including the empty set $\\emptyset$ (the union of an empty collection of basis sets).\n- Single basis elements: $\\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{3, 4\\}, X$.\n- Unions of basis elements:\n  - $\\{1, 2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$\n  - $\\{2\\} \\cup \\{3, 4\\} = \\{2, 3, 4\\}$\n  - Other unions either produce existing sets (e.g., $\\{2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{2, 3\\}$) or the whole space $X$.\n\nSo, the complete topology is:\n$\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{3, 4\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\}, \\{2, 3, 4\\}, X\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the separation properties of $(X, \\mathcal{T})$**\n\nTo evaluate the given options, we check several topological properties.\n\n- **Is the space $T_1$?** A space is $T_1$ if and only if all singleton sets are closed. Let's find the closed sets, which are the complements of the open sets in $\\mathcal{T}$:\n  - $X \\setminus \\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{4\\}$. So $\\{4\\}$ is closed.\n  - $X \\setminus \\{2, 3, 4\\} = \\{1\\}$. So $\\{1\\}$ is closed.\n  - $X \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{1, 3, 4\\}$. So $\\{1, 3, 4\\}$ is closed.\n  - The closure of $\\{2\\}$, denoted $\\overline{\\{2\\}}$, is the intersection of all closed sets containing $2$. The closed sets are the complements of the open sets: $\\mathcal{C} = \\{\\emptyset, X, \\{1\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}\\}$. The smallest closed set containing $2$ is $\\{1,2\\}$ (the complement of the open set $\\{3,4\\}$). Thus, $\\overline{\\{2\\}} = \\{1, 2\\}$. Since $\\overline{\\{2\\}} \\neq \\{2\\}$, the set $\\{2\\}$ is not closed.\n  Therefore, the space is not $T_1$. This eliminates option E.\n\n- **Is the space regular?** A space is regular if for every point $x$ and a closed set $F$ not containing $x$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $F \\subseteq V$. Since the space is not $T_1$, it can be normal without being regular.\n  Let's test this. Consider the point $x=2$ and the closed set $F = \\{1, 4\\}$. Note that $F$ is closed because its complement, $\\{2,3\\}$, is open. We have $x \\notin F$.\n  - An open neighborhood of $F=\\{1,4\\}$ must contain both $1$ and $4$. Examining the open sets in $\\mathcal{T}$, the only open set containing both $1$ and $4$ is $X$ itself. So, any open set $V$ with $F \\subseteq V$ must be $V=X$.\n  - Any open set $U$ containing $x=2$ is non-empty. For example, we can take $U=\\{2\\}$.\n  - The intersection $U \\cap V = \\{2\\} \\cap X = \\{2\\} \\neq \\emptyset$. Since the only open neighborhood available for $F=\\{1,4\\}$ is $X$, no open neighborhood of $x=2$ can be disjoint from it.\n  Therefore, the space is not regular. This eliminates option D.\n\n- **Is the space normal?** A space is normal if for any two disjoint closed sets $F_1, F_2$, there exist disjoint open sets $U_1, U_2$ such that $F_1 \\subseteq U_1$ and $F_2 \\subseteq U_2$.\n  Let's test the most obvious pair of disjoint, non-empty closed sets: $F_1 = \\{1\\}$ and $F_2 = \\{4\\}$.\n  - Open sets containing $F_1=\\{1\\}$ are $\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\}, X$. Let's choose $U_1 = \\{1, 2\\}$.\n  - Open sets containing $F_2=\\{4\\}$ are $\\{3, 4\\}, \\{2, 3, 4\\}, X$. Let's choose $U_2 = \\{3, 4\\}$.\n  We have $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\{1, 2\\} \\cap \\{3, 4\\} = \\emptyset$. Since we found such disjoint open neighborhoods, this pair of closed sets can be separated. A full proof would check all pairs of disjoint closed sets, but this separation is a strong indicator of normality. In fact, the space is normal.\n  This eliminates option C.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if the space is hereditarily normal**\n\nA space is hereditarily normal if every subspace is normal. We already know $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is normal. We must check its proper subspaces. Subspaces with 0, 1, or 2 points are always normal (usually having the discrete topology). The non-trivial check is for 3-point subspaces. There are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ such subspaces.\n\nLet's check the subspace $Y = \\{1, 2, 4\\}$ with the subspace topology $\\mathcal{T}_Y = \\{U \\cap Y \\mid U \\in \\mathcal{T}\\}$.\n- Open sets in $Y$:\n  - $\\emptyset \\cap Y = \\emptyset$\n  - $\\{2\\} \\cap Y = \\{2\\}$\n  - $\\{3\\} \\cap Y = \\emptyset$\n  - $\\{1,2\\} \\cap Y = \\{1,2\\}$\n  - $\\{3,4\\} \\cap Y = \\{4\\}$\n  - $\\{2,3,4\\} \\cap Y = \\{2,4\\}$\n  - $X \\cap Y = Y$\n  So, $\\mathcal{T}_Y = \\{\\emptyset, \\{2\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{2,4\\}, Y\\}$.\n- Closed sets in $Y$ (complements in $Y$):\n  - $Y \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{1,4\\}$\n  - $Y \\setminus \\{4\\} = \\{1,2\\}$\n  - $Y \\setminus \\{1,2\\} = \\{4\\}$\n  - $Y \\setminus \\{2,4\\} = \\{1\\}$\n  The closed sets are $\\mathcal{C}_Y = \\{\\emptyset, Y, \\{1\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,4\\}\\}$.\n- Check for normality of $Y$. Consider the disjoint closed sets $A=\\{1\\}$ and $B=\\{4\\}$ in $Y$.\n  - Open sets in $Y$ containing $A=\\{1\\}$: $U_A$ must be a superset of $\\{1\\}$ from $\\mathcal{T}_Y$. These are $\\{1,2\\}$ and $Y$.\n  - Open sets in $Y$ containing $B=\\{4\\}$: $U_B$ must be a superset of $\\{4\\}$ from $\\mathcal{T}_Y$. These are $\\{4\\}$, $\\{2,4\\}$, and $Y$.\n  - We need to find a disjoint pair $(U_1, U_2)$ where $U_1$ is a neighborhood for $A$ and $U_2$ for $B$.\n  - Let's choose $U_1 = \\{1,2\\}$ and $U_2 = \\{4\\}$. Both are open in $Y$. $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\emptyset$.\n  - Since we can separate this pair, and it's the only non-trivial pair of disjoint closed sets, the subspace $Y=\\{1,2,4\\}$ is normal.\n\nA similar analysis shows that all other 3-point subspaces ($\\{1,2,3\\}$, $\\{1,3,4\\}$, and $\\{2,3,4\\}$) are also normal.\n- For $Y=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $\\mathcal{T}_Y = \\{\\emptyset, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, Y\\}$.

Therefore $\\mathbb{R}$ is hereditarily normal. So A does not provide the requested example.\n\n- Option B: The Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ (lower limit topology) is Tychonoff. One way to see this is that $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is a generalized ordered space (a GO-space), and GO-spaces are completely regular and Hausdorff, hence Tychonoff.
