By definition, a set $U\\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $U=\\emptyset$ or $X\\setminus U$ is finite.\n\nFirst, verify the $T_{1}$ property. For any distinct $x,y\\in X$, the set $X\\setminus\\{y\\}$ is cofinite and hence open, it contains $x$ but not $y$. Similarly, $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is open, contains $y$ but not $x$.

A set $C\\subseteq X$ is closed if and only if $X\\setminus C$ is open, i.e., $X\\setminus C=\\emptyset$ or $X\\setminus C$ is finite. Hence the closed sets are exactly the finite subsets of $X$ together with $X$ itself. In particular, for any $x\\in X$, the singleton $\\{x\\}$ is closed.\n\nTo test normality, recall the definition: a $T_{1}$ space is normal if for any disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $A\\subseteq U$ and $B\\subseteq V$. Since $X$ is infinite, there exist two disjoint nonempty closed sets, for example $A=\\{0\\}$ and $B=\\{1\\}$. Suppose, towards normality, that there are open sets $U$ and $V$ with $A\\subseteq U$, $B\\subseteq V$, and $U\\cap V=\\emptyset$. Because $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, both $U$ and $V$ must be nonempty.

Since $y\\in[2,3]$, $y-1\\in[1,2]$, and as $x\\in[0,1]$, the only possibility is $x=1$ and $y=2$. But $[1]=[2]$ in $Y$, so $[x]=[y]$.
