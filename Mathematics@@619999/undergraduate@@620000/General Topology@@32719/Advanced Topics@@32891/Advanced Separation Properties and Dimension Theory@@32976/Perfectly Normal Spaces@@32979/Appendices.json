First, regularity: for any closed set $C \\subseteq X$ and any $x \\in X \\setminus C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U_{x}$ and $V_{x}$ such that $x \\in U_{x}$ and $C \\subseteq V_{x}$. Second, second-countable implies Lindelöf: every open cover has a countable subcover.\n\nFix the closed set $C \\neq \\emptyset$. For each $x \\in X \\setminus C$, by regularity choose open sets $U_{x}$ and $V_{x}$ with $x \\in U_{x}$, $C \\subseteq V_{x}$, and $U_{x} \\cap V_{x} = \\emptyset$.

Conversely, if $y \\in X \\setminus C$, then $y \\in U_{x_{n}}$ for some $n$ (because $\\{U_{x_{n}}\\}$ covers $X \\setminus C$), hence $y \\notin V_{x_{n}}$ by $U_{x_{n}} \\cap V_{x_{n}} = \\emptyset$. Therefore $y \\notin \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} V_{x_{n}}$, proving the equality.

This is precisely the method described in option A.\n\nNow we examine the other proposed procedures:\n\n- B defines $\\mathcal{J} = \\{n : B_{n} \\subseteq X \\setminus C\\}$ and claims $C = \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{J}} (X \\setminus B_{n})$.

While the equality holds, the sets $(X \\setminus B_{n})$ are closed, not open, so this does not provide a $G_{\\delta}$ representation. Hence B does not answer the stated task.\n\n- C uses $\\mathcal{K} = \\{n : C \\subseteq B_{n}\\}$ and claims $C = \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{K}} B_{n}$. This is generally invalid: there need not exist any single basis element containing all of $C$, so $\\mathcal{K}$ may be empty or the intersection may strictly contain $C$ only in trivial cases; it is not a general method.\n\n- D uses $\\mathcal{I} = \\{n : B_{n} \\cap C \\neq \\emptyset\\}$ and claims $C = \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{I}} B_{n}$. This is false: for any $x \\in C$, there typically exist basis elements $B_{n}$ intersecting $C$ that avoid $x$, so $x$ would be excluded from the intersection, making the intersection much smaller than $C$.\n\nTherefore, only procedure A correctly and generally constructs a countable sequence of open sets whose intersection equals $C$ in a regular, second-countable space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1568003"}, {"introduction": "Understanding how topological properties behave under constructions like the product topology is a core skill in topology.

Therefore B implies perfect normality.\n\nConversely, assume $X$ is perfectly normal. Let $A \\subset X$ be a closed proper set. Because $X$ is normal and $A$ is a $G_{\\delta}$, we can represent $A$ as a zero set of a continuous function. Explicitly, since $A=\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} O_{n}$ for open sets $O_{n}$ with $O_{n+1}\\subset O_{n}$ and $A \\subset O_{n}$, normality (Urysohn lemma) gives continuous $u_{n}: X \\to [0,1]$ with $u_{n}=0$ on $A$ and $u_{n}=1$ on $X \\setminus O_{n}$. The series\n$$\nh(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n} u_{n}(x)\n$$\nconverges uniformly, hence $h$ is continuous. Clearly $h=0$ on $A$, while if $x \\notin A$ then $x \\notin O_{n}$ for some $n$, implying $u_{n}(x)=1$ and thus $h(x) \\geq 2^{-n} > 0$. Hence $A = h^{-1}(0)$ with $h>0$ on $X \\setminus A$.

This proves that B is equivalent to perfect normality.\n\nWe now discuss the other options:\n\nA. In a perfectly normal space, B holds, which directly implies A (nonextendability follows from divergence to infinity). However, A is strictly weaker than B and does not force the existence of zero-set functions, hence it does not characterize perfect normality.\n\nC. The existence of a continuous function separating any two disjoint closed sets is the Urysohn property, equivalent to normality (in the presence of mild separation axioms). Normality alone does not imply that every closed set is a $G_{\\delta}$, so C is strictly weaker than perfect normality.\n\nD. Separation of two points by a continuous real-valued function is weaker than separation of arbitrary disjoint closed sets; it does not imply perfect normality.\n\nE. Hereditary normality (every subspace normal) does not ensure that every closed set is a $G_{\\delta}$.
