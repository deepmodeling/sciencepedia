Note that the empty set is not typically listed as a basis element, but it will be in the topology.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the topology from the basis.**\nThe topology $\\mathcal{T}$ consists of all possible unions of elements of the basis $\\mathcal{B}$, including the empty union ($\\emptyset$) and the union of all basis elements ($X$).\n\n- The basis elements are open: $\\{a\\}, \\{c\\}, \\{a,b\\}, \\{a,c\\}, \\{c,d\\}$.\n- Unions of basis elements:\n  - $\\{a\\} \\cup \\{c\\} = \\{a, c\\}$ (already in $\\mathcal{B}$)\n  - $\\{a\\} \\cup \\{a,b\\} = \\{a,b\\}$ (already in $\\mathcal{B}$)\n  - $\\{a\\} \\cup \\{c,d\\} = \\{a,c,d\\}$\n  - $\\{c\\} \\cup \\{a,b\\} = \\{a,b,c\\}$\n  - $\\{a,b\\} \\cup \\{c,d\\} = \\{a,b,c,d\\} = X$\n  - Other unions will not produce new sets (e.g., $\\{a,b\\} \\cup \\{a,c\\} = \\{a,b,c\\}$).\n\nSo, the full topology is $\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{a\\}, \\{c\\}, \\{a,b\\}, \\{a,c\\}, \\{c,d\\}, \\{a,b,c\\}, \\{a,c,d\\}, X\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Check the separation axioms.**\n\n**T0 (Kolmogorov):** For any distinct $x, y \\in X$, there is an open set containing one but not the other.\n- Pair $(a, b)$: The open set $\\{a\\}$ contains $a$ but not $b$.\n- Pair $(a, c)$: The open set $\\{a\\}$ contains $a$ but not $c$.\n- Pair $(a, d)$: The open set $\\{a\\}$ contains $a$ but not $d$.\n- Pair $(b, c)$: The open set $\\{c\\}$ contains $c$ but not $b$.\n- Pair $(b, d)$: The open set $\\{c,d\\}$ contains $d$ but not $b$.\n- Pair $(c, d)$: The open set $\\{c\\}$ contains $c$ but not $d$.\nSince this property holds for all pairs of distinct points, the space is **T0**.\n\n**T1 (Fréchet):** For any distinct $x, y \\in X$, there is an open set containing $x$ but not $y$, AND an open set containing $y$ but not $x$.\nLet's examine the pair $(a, b)$.\n- We need an open set containing $a$ but not $b$.

Let's test this condition.\nConsider an even integer $x$ and the adjacent odd integer $y = x-1$. We need to find an open set $U$ that contains $x$ but not $y$. Any open set $U$ containing $x$ must be a union of basis elements, and at least one of these basis elements, say $B$, must contain $x$. Since $x$ is even, the only type of basis element that can contain $x$ is a set of the form $\\{n-1, n, n+1\\}$ where $n$ is even. Because $x \\in B$, we must have $n=x$, so $B = \\{x-1, x, x+1\\}$. This set contains $y = x-1$. Since any open set $U$ containing $x$ must contain the basis element $B$, it follows that $U$ must also contain $y$. It is impossible to find an open set containing $x$ but not $y$.\nTherefore, the space fails the $T_1$ condition.\n\nSince the space is not $T_1$, it cannot be $T_2$, $T_3$, or $T_4$, as these axioms require the space to be $T_1$.\n\nThe highest separation axiom satisfied by $(\\mathbb{Z},\\tau)$ is $T_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1552057"}, {"introduction": "This final practice presents a fascinating and deeply instructive counterexample that challenges the intuitive hierarchy of separation axioms.

The open sets containing $a$ are $\\{a,b\\}$ and $X$. Both of these sets also contain $b$. There is no open set that contains $a$ but not $b$.

To verify directly, consider the distinct points $a$ and $b$. The only open set containing $a$ (besides $X$) is $U = \\{a,b\\}$. The only open set containing $b$ (besides $X$) is also $V = \\{a,b\\}$. There are no disjoint open sets separating $a$ and $b$.

These are open, $c \\in U$, $\\{a,b\\} \\subseteq V$, and $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$. So the condition holds. The same choice works for $x=d$.\n2. Let $C = \\{c,d\\}$. A point not in $C$ can be $a$ or $b$. Let's pick $x=a$. We need disjoint open sets $U, V$ with $a \\in U$ and $\\{c,d\\} \\subseteq V$.\n   - We can choose $U=\\{a,b\\}$ and $V=\\{c,d\\}$. These are open, $a \\in U$, $\\{c,d\\} \\subseteq V$, and $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$.
