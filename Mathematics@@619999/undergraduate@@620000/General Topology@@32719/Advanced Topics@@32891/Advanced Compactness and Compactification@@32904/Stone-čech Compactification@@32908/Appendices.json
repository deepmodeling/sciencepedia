This property is precisely the condition required for a space to be embeddable into a cube $[0, 1]^J$ for some index set $J$.\n\nFor any Tychonoff space $X$, there exists a unique (up to homeomorphism) compact Hausdorff space $\\beta X$, called the **Stone-Čech compactification** of $X$, along with a canonical embedding map $e: X \\to \\beta X$. The pair $(\\beta X, e)$ is characterized by the following universal property: For any continuous map $f$ from $X$ to a compact Hausdorff space $K$, there exists a unique continuous map $\\beta f: \\beta X \\to K$ such that $f = \\beta f \\circ e$.\n\nA key consequence of this property is that we can identify $X$ with its homeomorphic image $e(X)$ within $\\beta X$, treating $X$ as a dense subspace of its compactification. Under this convention, the universal property simplifies to: any continuous map from $X$ into a compact Hausdorff space $K$ has a unique continuous extension to a map from $\\beta X$ to $K$.\n\nConsider two Tychonoff spaces, $X$ and $Y$, and let $h: X \\to Y$ be a homeomorphism.

We will demonstrate that $\\beta h$ is itself a homeomorphism by constructing its inverse and showing it is continuous.\n\n1.  **Constructing a candidate for the inverse map.**\n    Since $h: X \\to Y$ is a homeomorphism, its inverse $h^{-1}: Y \\to X$ exists and is also a continuous map. We can view $h^{-1}$ as a map from the space $Y$ into the compact Hausdorff space $\\beta X$. By the universal property of the Stone-Čech compactification applied to $Y$, there exists a unique continuous extension of $h^{-1}$ to a map from $\\beta Y$ to $\\beta X$. Let's call this extension $g: \\beta Y \\to \\beta X$. So, $g$ is a continuous map, and its restriction to the subspace $Y$ is $h^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **Verifying that $g$ is the left inverse of $\\beta h$.**\n    Let's analyze the composition $g \\circ \\beta h: \\beta X \\to \\beta X$.

For any point $x \\in X$:\n    $(g \\circ \\beta h)(x) = g(\\beta h(x))$\n    By definition, the extension $\\beta h$ agrees with $h$ on $X$, so $\\beta h(x) = h(x)$.\n    $g(\\beta h(x)) = g(h(x))$\n    The point $h(x)$ is in the space $Y$. By definition, the extension $g$ agrees with $h^{-1}$ on $Y$.\n    $g(h(x)) = h^{-1}(h(x)) = x$.\n    So, for every $x \\in X$, $(g \\circ \\beta h)(x) = x$. This means the continuous map $g \\circ \\beta h$ agrees with the identity map $\\text{id}_{\\beta X}$ on the dense subset $X$ of $\\beta X$. In any Hausdorff space (which $\\beta X$ is), if two continuous functions into it agree on a dense subset, they must be equal everywhere. Therefore, we conclude that $g \\circ \\beta h = \\text{id}_{\\beta X}$.\n\n3.  **Verifying that $g$ is the right inverse of $\\beta h$.**\n    Now, let's analyze the composition $\\beta h \\circ g: \\beta Y \\to \\beta Y$. This is also a continuous map. We check its behavior on the dense subset $Y \\subset \\beta Y$. For any point $y \\in Y$:\n    $(\\beta h \\circ g)(y) = \\beta h(g(y))$\n    By definition, $g$ agrees with $h^{-1}$ on $Y$, so $g(y) = h^{-1}(y)$.\n    $\\beta h(g(y)) = \\beta h(h^{-1}(y))$\n    The point $h^{-1}(y)$ is in the space $X$. By definition, $\\beta h$ agrees with $h$ on $X$.\n    $\\beta h(h^{-1}(y)) = h(h^{-1}(y)) = y$.\n    So, for every $y \\in Y$, $(\\beta h \\circ g)(y) = y$.  The continuous map $\\beta h \\circ g$ agrees with the identity map $\\text{id}_{\\beta Y}$ on the dense subset $Y$ of $\\beta Y$. Since $\\beta Y$ is a Hausdorff space, this implies that $\\beta h \\circ g = \\text{id}_{\\beta Y}$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    We have shown that the map $g: \\beta Y \\to \\beta X$ is the inverse of $\\beta h: \\beta X \\to \\beta Y$. This means $\\beta h$ is a bijection. By its definition, $\\beta h$ is continuous. The inverse map $g$ was also constructed as a continuous extension, so it is also continuous. A continuous bijection whose inverse is also continuous is, by definition, a homeomorphism. Thus, the extension $\\beta h$ is always a homeomorphism.\n\nTherefore, statement D is the correct description of the map $\\beta h$. The other options are incorrect: A and B are false because $\\beta h$ is a bijection. C is false because the inverse is continuous.
