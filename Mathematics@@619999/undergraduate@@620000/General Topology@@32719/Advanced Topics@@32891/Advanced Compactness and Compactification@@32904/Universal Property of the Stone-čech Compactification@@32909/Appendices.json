A topological space is called a **Tychonoff space** if it is a Hausdorff space where for any closed set $C$ and any point $x$ not in $C$, there is a continuous function from the space to the real interval $[0, 1]$ that maps $x$ to $0$ and all points in $C$ to $1$.\n\nFor any Tychonoff space $X$, there exists a special construction called the **Stone-Čech compactification**.
