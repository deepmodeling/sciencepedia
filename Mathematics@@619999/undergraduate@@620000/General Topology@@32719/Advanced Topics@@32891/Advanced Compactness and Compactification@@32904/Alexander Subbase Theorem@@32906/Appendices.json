One powerful tool is the Alexander subbase theorem.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- A **topology** on a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, called open sets, satisfying certain axioms.\n- The **discrete topology** on a set $X$ is the topology in which every subset of $X$ is an open set. Consequently, every singleton set $\\{x\\}$ for $x \\in X$ is an open set.\n- A **subbase** for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\\mathcal{S}$ of open sets whose finite intersections form a base for the topology. For the discrete topology on a set $X$, the collection of all singleton sets, $\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\{x\\} \\mid x \\in X\\}$, is a valid subbase.\n- A space $X$ is **compact** if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.\n- **Alexander Subbase Theorem**: A topological space $X$ is compact if and only if every cover of $X$ by members of a subbase $\\mathcal{S}$ has a finite subcover.\n\nLet $X$ be an infinite set endowed with the discrete topology. Consider the subbase $\\mathcal{S}$ consisting of all singleton subsets of $X$. We can form an open cover of $X$ using only elements from this subbase, namely the cover $\\mathcal{C} = \\mathcal{S} = \\{\\{x\\} \\mid x \\in X\\}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning, based on the Alexander Subbase Theorem, for why the infinite set $X$ with the discrete topology is not compact?\n\nA. The collection $\\mathcal{C}$ is a cover of $X$ by elements of the subbase $\\mathcal{S}$. Since $X$ is infinite, any finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ can only cover a finite number of points and thus cannot cover all of $X$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{C}$ has no finite subcover, and by the Alexander subbase theorem, $X$ is not compact.\n\nB. The Alexander subbase theorem is not applicable here because the subbase $\\mathcal{S}$ itself forms an open cover. The theorem is only useful for subbases that are not themselves covers.\n\nC. For $X$ to be non-compact, we must show that *every* possible open cover made from the subbase lacks a finite subcover. Finding just one such cover, $\\mathcal{C}$, is insufficient to draw a conclusion.\n\nD. The set $X$ is not compact because the singleton sets in the discrete topology are both open and closed (clopen). The Alexander subbase theorem implies that spaces with subbase elements that are also closed cannot be compact.\n\nE. Any finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ fails to be a cover, but the collection $\\mathcal{C}$ itself can be considered a \"finite subcover\" because its union is the single set $X$.

Statements B, C, D, and E are incorrect: B wrongly asserts the theorem is inapplicable when the subbase itself covers $X$; C mistakenly demands failure for all subbase covers rather than the existence of one counterexample; D incorrectly infers non-compactness from subbase elements being clopen; E misinterprets “finite subcover,” which requires finitely many sets, not merely that the union equals $X$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1530715"}, {"introduction": "Having explored non-compactness, we now turn to a constructive proof of compactness for the familiar closed interval $[0,1]$.
