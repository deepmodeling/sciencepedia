Both $\\mathbb{R}$ with the Euclidean topology and $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the discrete topology satisfy the hypotheses, so $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ are compact Hausdorff.\n\nFirst, compare connectedness. The space $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected. If $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$ were disconnected, write $\\mathbb{R}^{*} = U \\cup V$ with $U,V$ disjoint nonempty open. Without loss of generality, $\\infty \\in U$, so $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}$.

For $\\mathbb{R}^{*}$, a countable base is obtained by taking a countable base of $\\mathbb{R}$ (for example, open intervals with rational endpoints) together with a countable local base at $\\infty$, for instance $U_{m} = \\{\\infty\\} \\cup \\left(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus [-m,m]\\right)$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$.
