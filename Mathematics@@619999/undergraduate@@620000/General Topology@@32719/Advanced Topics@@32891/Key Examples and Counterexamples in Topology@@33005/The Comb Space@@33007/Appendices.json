Now, let's define two paths from $A$ to $B$ within this space. For this purpose, let $O = (0, 0)$, $C = (1/2, 0)$, and $D = (1/2, 1)$. Note that these points are also in $X$.\n\nWe will use the notation $L_{PQ}$ to represent the straight-line path from a point $P$ to a point $Q$. The symbol $*$ denotes path concatenation, with the understanding that the resulting path is appropriately reparameterized to have a domain of $[0,1]$.\n\nThe two paths are defined as follows:\n- **Path 1:** $\\gamma_1 = L_{AO} * L_{OB}$. This path travels from $A$ down the spine to the origin $O$, and then along the base to $B$.\n- **Path 2:** $\\gamma_2 = L_{AO} * L_{OC} * L_{CD} * L_{DC} * L_{CB}$.

The space $X$ is path-connected but not contractible.", "solution": "We analyze the space $X$ and the two piecewise-linear paths $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$.\n\nFirst, both paths lie entirely in $X$ by construction:\n- $L_{AO}$ lies in $\\{0\\} \\times [0,1]$,\n- $L_{OB}$ and $L_{CB}$ lie in $[0,1] \\times \\{0\\}$,\n- $L_{OC}$ lies in $[0,1] \\times \\{0\\}$,\n- $L_{CD}$ and $L_{DC}$ lie in $\\{1/2\\} \\times [0,1]$.\nThus $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ are continuous paths in $X$. The presence of corners does not affect continuity, because concatenations of continuous maps are continuous, and linear parametrizations of segments are continuous. Therefore, statement D is false.\n\nNext, we show that $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ are path-homotopic relative to endpoints. Observe that $\\gamma_{2}$ differs from $\\gamma_{1}$ only by inserting the subloop that goes up and down the tooth $\\{1/2\\} \\times [0,1]$ at the point $C=(1/2,0)$. Consider the subspace\n$$\nZ = \\bigl([0,1] \\times \\{0\\}\\bigr) \\cup \\bigl(\\{0\\} \\times [0,1]\\bigr) \\cup \\bigl(\\{1/2\\} \\times [0,1]\\bigr),\n$$\nwhich contains the images of both paths. Define a homotopy of paths $H:[0,1] \\times [0,1] \\to X$ that gradually shortens the excursion up the tooth:\n- For $u \\in [0,1]$, let $H(u,\\cdot)$ be the path that follows $L_{AO}$, then $L_{OC}$, then goes up from $C$ to $\\bigl(1/2,(1-u)\\bigr)$ and back down to $C$ along the same tooth, then proceeds along $L_{CB}$.\nThis is continuous as a map $[0,1] \\times [0,1] \\to X$ because it is defined by continuous formulas on finitely many linear pieces with continuous dependence on $u$; for $u=0$ it equals $\\gamma_{2}$, and for $u=1$ the tooth excursion vanishes, so the path equals $\\gamma_{1}$ after reparametrization. Endpoints are fixed for all $u$ because $A$ and $B$ are not moved at any stage. Hence $\\gamma_{1} \\simeq \\gamma_{2}$ rel $\\{A,B\\}$, so A is true and B is false.\n\nWe now verify the deformation retraction claim. Let $Y=\\text{Im}(\\gamma_{1})$ and $Z=\\text{Im}(\\gamma_{2})=Y \\cup \\bigl(\\{1/2\\} \\times [0,1]\\bigr)$. Define\n$$\nR: Z \\times [0,1] \\to Z,\\quad\nR\\bigl((x,y),t\\bigr) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bigl(1/2,(1-t)y\\bigr), & \\text{if } x=1/2, \\\\\n(x,y), & \\text{if } y=0 \\text{ or } x=0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis map is continuous because it is linear on the tooth, fixes the base and spine pointwise, and these pieces meet along their intersections where the formulas agree. One has $R(\\cdot,0)=\\text{id}_{Z}$, $R(Z,1) \\subseteq Y$, and $R(y,t)=y$ for all $y \\in Y$, $t \\in [0,1]$. Thus $Y$ is a deformation retract of $Z$, so C is true.\n\nFinally, we determine whether $X$ is contractible. Define a contraction $H: X \\times [0,1] \\to X$ in two stages. First collapse all vertical segments to the base:\n$$\nH_{1}\\bigl((x,y),t\\bigr) =\n\\begin{cases}\n(x,(1-t)y), & \\text{if } x=0 \\text{ or } x=\\frac{1}{n} \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\\\\n(x,0), & \\text{if } y=0,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhich is continuous on $X$ and satisfies $H_{1}(\\cdot,0)=\\text{id}_{X}$ and $H_{1}(X,1) \\subseteq [0,1] \\times \\{0\\}$. Then collapse the base to $O$:\n$$\nH_{2}\\bigl((x,0),s\\bigr) = \\bigl((1-s)x,0\\bigr).\n$$\nCombine these to a single homotopy $H$ by\n$$\nH(p,t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nH_{1}(p,2t), & t \\in [0,1/2], \\\\\nH_{2}\\bigl(H_{1}(p,1),2t-1\\bigr), & t \\in [1/2,1].\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis $H$ is continuous, remains in $X$ for all $t$, satisfies $H(\\cdot,0)=\\text{id}_{X}$, and $H(\\cdot,1)$ is the constant map at $O$. Therefore $X$ is contractible.

The set $L=\\{0\\}\\times(0,1]$ is homeomorphic to $(0,1]$ via projection onto the second coordinate, hence it is path-connected.\n\n3) Nonexistence of paths from $L$ to $R$. Assume for contradiction that there exists a continuous path $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to C'$ with $\\gamma(0)=(0,y_{0})\\in L$ for some $y_{0}\\in(0,1]$ and $\\gamma(1)\\in R$. Write $\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$. The set $S=\\{t\\in[0,1]:x(t)=0\\}$ is closed and nonempty, and let $t_{0}=\\sup S$. Then $t_{0}<1$ because $x(1)>0$ for $\\gamma(1)\\in R$. Continuity of $\\gamma$ gives $\\gamma(t_{0})=(0,y_{*})$ for some $y_{*}\\in(0,1]$.\n\nFor $t>t_{0}$ close to $t_{0}$, we have $x(t)>0$. Since $\\gamma(t)\\in C'$, if $x(t)\\notin\\{1/n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ then necessarily $y(t)=0$ (because the only points of $C'$ with $x\\notin\\{0\\}\\cup\\{1/n\\}$ lie on the base $(0,1]\\times\\{0\\}$). But $y(t)\\to y_{*}>0$ as $t\\to t_{0}^{+}$ by continuity, so for all $t$ sufficiently close to $t_{0}$ with $t>t_{0}$ we must have $x(t)\\in\\{1/n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ and $y(t)>0$.\n\nThe set $\\{1/n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is discrete in $(0,1]$, so by continuity of $x$, there exists $\\delta>0$ and some fixed $n_{0}\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $x(t)=\\frac{1}{n_{0}}$ for all $t\\in(t_{0},t_{0}+\\delta)$. Then $\\lim_{t\\to t_{0}^{+}}x(t)=\\frac{1}{n_{0}}$, but $x(t_{0})=0$, contradicting continuity of $x$ at $t_{0}$. Hence no path in $C'$ connects a point of $L$ to a point of $R$.

Indeed, fix $(0,y)\\in L$ with $y\\in(0,1]$, and let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $(0,y)$ in $C'$, so $U=C'\\cap V$ for some open $V\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
