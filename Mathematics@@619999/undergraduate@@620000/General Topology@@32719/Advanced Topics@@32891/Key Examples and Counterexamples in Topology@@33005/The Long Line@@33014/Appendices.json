Inside the fiber $\\{\\alpha\\}\\times[0,1)$ with the induced order $(\\alpha,t)<(\\alpha,u)$ iff $t<u$, the order on $[0,1)$ is dense with no immediate successors or predecessors for any $t$ with $0<t<1$. Therefore, for any $(\\alpha,t)$ with $0<t<1$, there is neither an immediate predecessor nor an immediate successor, so such a point cannot be isolated.\n\nConsider points of the form $(\\alpha,0)$.

If $\\alpha=\\beta+1$ is a successor ordinal, the set $\\{(\\beta,t):0\\leq t<1\\}$ has no largest element because $[0,1)$ has no maximum. Hence $(\\alpha,0)$ has no immediate predecessor.

There is no point with $t=1$ in $L$.\n\nFinally, examine the minimum element $(0,0)$. For $(0,0)$ to be isolated, it must have an immediate successor $y$ so that $[\\, (0,0), y )=\\{(0,0)\\}$. But the set of points greater than $(0,0)$ includes $(0,t)$ for all $t>0$, and there is no least such $t$, hence no immediate successor of $(0,0)$ exists.\n\nCombining these observations:\n- No point has both an immediate predecessor and an immediate successor.\n- The minimum point $(0,0)$ has no immediate successor.\nTherefore, no point of $L$ is isolated.
