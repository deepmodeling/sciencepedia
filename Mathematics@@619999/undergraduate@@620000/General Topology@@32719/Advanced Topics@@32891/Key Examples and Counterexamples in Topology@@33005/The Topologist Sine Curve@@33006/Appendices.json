It is defined as the closure of the set $S = \\{ (x, \\sin(1/x)) \\mid 0 < x \\le \\pi^{-1} \\}$. The closure of $S$ includes all its limit points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. As $x$ approaches $0$ from the right, the value of $1/x$ goes to infinity, and $\\sin(1/x)$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$. Any point $(0, y)$ where $y \\in [-1, 1]$ is a limit point of $S$. Therefore, the closure of $S$ is the union of the original curve $S$ and the vertical line segment $\\{0\\} \\times [-1, 1]$.\nLet's denote the curve part as $S$ and the vertical segment as $L = \\{ (0, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid -1 \\le y \\le 1 \\}$.\nSo, $T = S \\cup L$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of path-connected components of the space $T' = T \\setminus \\{(0, 1)\\}$.\nThis means $T' = (S \\cup L) \\setminus \\{(0, 1)\\}$. Since the point $(0, 1)$ is in $L$ but not in $S$, this is equivalent to $T' = S \\cup (L \\setminus \\{(0, 1)\\})$.\n\nLet's analyze the potential components of $T'$. Let $S$ be one potential component and let $L' = L \\setminus \\{(0, 1)\\}$ be the other. So $T' = S \\cup L'$. We need to check the path-connectedness of these two sets and whether they are path-connected to each other.\n\n1.  **Path-connectedness of S**: The set $S = \\{ (x, \\sin(1/x)) \\mid 0 < x \\le \\pi^{-1} \\}$ is the image of the interval $(0, \\pi^{-1}]$ under the continuous map $f(x) = (x, \\sin(1/x))$. Since $(0, \\pi^{-1}]$ is a path-connected set and the continuous image of a path-connected set is path-connected, $S$ is path-connected.\n\n2.  **Path-connectedness of L'**: The set $L'$ is defined as $L' = L \\setminus \\{(0, 1)\\} = \\{ (0, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid -1 \\le y < 1 \\}$. This is a vertical line segment that is closed at one end and open at the other. To show it is path-connected, consider any two points $p_1 = (0, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (0, y_2)$ in $L'$. This means $y_1, y_2 \\in [-1, 1)$. We can define a path $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ by $\\gamma(t) = (0, (1-t)y_1 + t y_2)$. The first coordinate is always 0. The second coordinate is a convex combination of $y_1$ and $y_2$. Since $y_1, y_2 \\in [-1, 1)$, for any $t \\in [0, 1]$, the value $(1-t)y_1 + t y_2$ is also in $[-1, 1)$. Therefore, the entire path $\\gamma$ lies within $L'$. This shows that any two points in $L'$ can be connected by a path in $L'$, so $L'$ is path-connected.\n\n3.  **Path-connection between S and L'**: Now we must determine if it is possible to connect a point in $S$ to a point in $L'$ with a path that lies entirely in $T'$. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that such a path exists. Let $p_S = (x_0, \\sin(1/x_0)) \\in S$ and $p_{L'} = (0, y_0) \\in L'$. Suppose there is a continuous path $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to T'$ with $\\gamma(0) = p_S$ and $\\gamma(1) = p_{L'}$. Let $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$.\nBy continuity, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are continuous functions of $t$. We have $x(0) = x_0 > 0$ and $x(1) = 0$.\nLet $t_0 = \\sup\\{ t \\in [0, 1] \\mid x(t) > 0 \\}$. Since $x(0) > 0$ and $x$ is continuous, $t_0 > 0$. By the definition of the supremum and continuity of $x(t)$, we must have $x(t_0) = 0$. This implies that the point $\\gamma(t_0)$ must lie on the vertical axis. Since $\\gamma(t_0) \\in T'$, it must be that $\\gamma(t_0) \\in L'$. Let $\\gamma(t_0) = (0, y^*)$ for some $y^* \\in [-1, 1)$.\nNow consider a sequence of times $t_n \\to t_0$ with $t_n < t_0$. By the definition of $t_0$, we have $x(t_n) > 0$ for all $n$. This means that the points $\\gamma(t_n)$ must be in the curve part $S$. Therefore, $\\gamma(t_n) = (x(t_n), \\sin(1/x(t_n)))$.\nSince $\\gamma$ is continuous at $t_0$, we must have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\gamma(t_n) = \\gamma(t_0)$. This means:\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (x(t_n), \\sin(1/x(t_n))) = (0, y^*)$.\nThis requires two conditions to be met:\n(a) $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x(t_n) = 0$. This is true by construction.\n(b) $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sin(1/x(t_n)) = y^*$.\nHowever, as $x(t_n) \\to 0^+$, the argument $1/x(t_n) \\to +\\infty$. The function $\\sin(u)$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ as $u \\to \\infty$ and does not approach any single limit. Therefore, the limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sin(1/x(t_n))$ does not exist. This is a contradiction.\nOur initial assumption that a path exists between $S$ and $L'$ must be false.\n\nThus, the space $T'$ is composed of two disjoint path-connected sets, $S$ and $L'$, and no path can connect one to the other. These are the path-connected components of $T'$. Therefore, $T'$ has exactly two path-connected components. The removal of the point $(0,1)$, an endpoint of the segment $L$, does not change the number of components compared to the original Topologist's Sine Curve $T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1590490"}]}
