A set is open if for every point in the set, there exists a basis element containing that point which is fully contained within the set. A set is closed if its complement is open.\n\nLet's examine option A: $S_A = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x+y < 5\\}$.\nFirst, we check if $S_A$ is open. Let $(x_0, y_0)$ be an arbitrary point in $S_A$. By definition, $x_0 + y_0 < 5$. Let $\\epsilon = 5 - (x_0 + y_0)$. Since $x_0 + y_0 < 5$, we have $\\epsilon > 0$. Consider the basis element $U = [x_0, x_0 + \\epsilon/2) \\times [y_0, y_0 + \\epsilon/2)$. This is a valid basis element containing the point $(x_0, y_0)$. For any point $(x,y) \\in U$, we have $x < x_0 + \\epsilon/2$ and $y < y_0 + \\epsilon/2$. Summing these inequalities gives $x+y < (x_0 + \\epsilon/2) + (y_0 + \\epsilon/2) = x_0 + y_0 + \\epsilon = x_0 + y_0 + (5 - (x_0 + y_0)) = 5$. Thus, every point $(x,y)$ in $U$ satisfies $x+y < 5$, which means $U \\subset S_A$. Since we found such a basis element for an arbitrary point $(x_0, y_0) \\in S_A$, the set $S_A$ is open.\n\nNext, we check if $S_A$ is closed. We do this by checking if its complement, $S_A^c = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x+y \\ge 5\\}$, is open. Let $(x_1, y_1)$ be an arbitrary point in $S_A^c$. By definition, $x_1 + y_1 \\ge 5$. Consider the basis element $V = [x_1, x_1+1) \\times [y_1, y_1+1)$. This is a valid basis element containing $(x_1, y_1)$. For any point $(x,y) \\in V$, we have $x \\ge x_1$ and $y \\ge y_1$. Summing these inequalities gives $x+y \\ge x_1 + y_1$. Since $x_1+y_1 \\ge 5$, we have $x+y \\ge 5$. Thus, every point $(x,y)$ in $V$ is in $S_A^c$, which means $V \\subset S_A^c$. Since we found such a basis element for an arbitrary point $(x_1, y_1) \\in S_A^c$, the set $S_A^c$ is open. As the complement of $S_A$ is open, $S_A$ is a closed set.\nSince $S_A$ is both open and closed, it is a clopen set. $S_A$ is non-empty (e.g., $(0,0) \\in S_A$) and not the whole space (e.g., $(5,5) \\notin S_A$). Therefore, $S_A$ demonstrates that the Sorgenfrey plane is disconnected.\n\nLet's examine option B: $S_B = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x-y < 5\\}$.\nIs $S_B$ open? Consider the point $(5, 1) \\in S_B$ since $5-1=4<5$. An arbitrary basis neighborhood of $(5,1)$ is of the form $U = [5, b) \\times [1, d)$ for $b>5, d>1$. Consider the point $(5, d-\\epsilon)$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$. This point is in $U$. The difference is $x-y = 5 - (d-\\epsilon) = 5-d+\\epsilon$. Since we can choose $d>1$ to be arbitrarily large, say $d=2$, the neighborhood is $[5,b) \\times [1,2)$. The point $(5, 1.9)$ is in $U$. Its difference is $5-1.9=3.1<5$. But let's check a point $(b-\\delta_x, 1) \\in U$ for small $\\delta_x>0$. The difference is $b-\\delta_x-1$. We can choose $b=7$. The neighborhood would be $[5,7) \\times [1,d)$. Points like $(6.9, 1)$ are in this neighborhood. $6.9-1 = 5.9 > 5$. This point is not in $S_B$. So no basis neighborhood of $(5,1)$ is entirely contained in $S_B$. Thus $S_B$ is not open.\nIs $S_B$ closed? Let's check its complement $S_B^c = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x-y \\ge 5\\}$. Consider the point $(6,1) \\in S_B^c$. An arbitrary basis neighborhood of $(6,1)$ is $V = [6, b) \\times [1, d)$. The point $(6, d-\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon>0$ is in $V$. The difference is $x-y = 6-(d-\\epsilon) = 6-d+\\epsilon$. If we choose $d=2$, we are considering the neighborhood $[6,b) \\times [1,2)$. The point $(6, 1.5)$ is in $V$. The difference is $6 - 1.5 = 4.5 < 5$. This point is not in $S_B^c$. So, $S_B^c$ is not open, which means $S_B$ is not closed.\nTherefore, $S_B$ is neither open nor closed.\n\nLet's examine option C: $S_C = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2+y^2 < 25\\}$.\nThis is the open disk of radius 5 centered at the origin in the standard Euclidean topology. The Sorgenfrey topology is finer (has more open sets) than the standard topology. Any set open in the standard topology is also open in the Sorgenfrey topology. Thus, $S_C$ is open.\nIs $S_C$ closed? Consider its complement $S_C^c = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2+y^2 \\ge 25\\}$. To show $S_C$ is not closed, we show $S_C^c$ is not open. Consider the point $(-5, 0)$, which is in $S_C^c$. Any basis neighborhood of this point is of the form $U = [-5, b) \\times [0, d)$ for $b>-5$ and $d>0$. Consider a point $(x,y) = (-5+\\epsilon, 0)$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $-5+\\epsilon < b$. This point is in $U$. Its squared distance from the origin is $x^2+y^2 = (-5+\\epsilon)^2 + 0^2 = 25 - 10\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2$. For sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, this value is less than 25 (e.g., if $\\epsilon < 10$). So the point $(-5+\\epsilon, 0)$ is in $S_C$, not in $S_C^c$. Therefore, the neighborhood $U$ is not entirely contained in $S_C^c$. Thus $S_C^c$ is not open, and $S_C$ is not closed.\nTherefore, $S_C$ is open but not closed.\n\nLet's examine option D: $S_D = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x+y = 5\\}$.\nThis is a line in the plane. Is it closed? Its complement is $S_D^c = \\{(x,y) \\mid x+y \\neq 5\\}$, which is the union of two sets: $U_1 = \\{(x,y) \\mid x+y < 5\\}$ and $U_2 = \\{(x,y) \\mid x+y > 5\\}$. From our analysis of option A, we know $U_1$ is open. A similar argument shows $U_2$ is also open: for any $(x_0, y_0) \\in U_2$, we have $x_0+y_0 > 5$. The neighborhood $[x_0, x_0+1) \\times [y_0, y_0+1)$ is contained in $U_2$. Since $S_D^c$ is the union of two open sets, it is open. Therefore, $S_D$ is closed.\nIs $S_D$ open? Consider the point $(5, 0) \\in S_D$. Any basis neighborhood is of the form $U = [5, b) \\times [0, d)$ for $b>5, d>0$. The point $(5, d/2)$ is in $U$. At this point, $x+y=5+d/2 > 5$, so this point is not in $S_D$. Therefore, no basis neighborhood of $(5,0)$ is contained within $S_D$. Thus, $S_D$ is not open.\nTherefore, $S_D$ is closed but not open.\n\nBased on the analysis of all four options, only $S_A$ is both open and closed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1586841"}, {"introduction": "We culminate our practice with one of topology's classic counterexamples, which addresses the crucial property of compactness.
