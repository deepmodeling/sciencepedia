A point $p$ is an accumulation point of $\\{p_{n}\\}$ if every neighborhood of $p$ contains infinitely many $p_{n}$. Consider any $(x_{0},0)$ with $x_{0} \\in [-1,1]$. Fix $r0$.

If $|x_{0}|1$, then $\\sin n \\in [-1,1]$ for all $n$, so we can choose $r0$ small enough that for all $y \\in (0,1]$, the horizontal slice $\\{u: |u - x_{0}|  \\sqrt{2 r y}\\}$ lies outside $[-1,1]$, hence $D_{r}$ contains no $p_{n}$ at all (since $y_{n} \\le 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$).
