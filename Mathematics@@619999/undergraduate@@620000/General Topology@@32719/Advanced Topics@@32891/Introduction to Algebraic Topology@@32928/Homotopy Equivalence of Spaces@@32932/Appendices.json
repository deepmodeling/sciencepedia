The subspace $X=C_{1} \\cup C_{2}$ is the union of the closed subsets $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ (they are closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, hence closed in $X$). The restrictions satisfy $r|_{C_{1}}=\\operatorname{id}_{C_{1}}$, which is continuous, and $r|_{C_{2}}$ is the constant map to $\\mathbf{0} \\in C_{1}$, which is continuous.
