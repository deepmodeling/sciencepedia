This means we impose the equivalence relations $(x, 0) \\sim (x, 1)$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$ and $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$ for all $y \\in [0,1]$. All four corners of the square are identified to a single point on the torus, which we will use as our base point, $x_0$.\n\nLet $a$ be a loop based at $x_0$ that traverses the torus \"horizontally\".

We are interested in the homotopy class of the composite loop $c = a * b * a^{-1} * b^{-1}$, which is the element $[c] = [a] [b] [a^{-1}] [b^{-1}]$ in $\\pi_1(T^2, x_0)$.

This is path-homotopic to the loop $b$ and represents the element $(0, 1)$.\n\nThe composite loop $c$ represents the identity element $(0,0)$. The only option that also represents the identity element is C, the constant loop.
