This problem [@problem_id:1548372] offers a hands-on method to discover this group by modeling the covering space as a labeled graph. Your task will be to find its \"symmetries\"—the graph automorphisms that preserve the edge labels—which correspond precisely to the deck transformations.", "problem": "Let $X$ be the bouquet of two circles, a topological space formed by joining two circles, $C_a$ and $C_b$, at a single point. For the purpose of analysis, we can model $X$ as a directed graph with a single vertex $v_0$ and two edges, labeled $a$ and $b$, which are loops starting and ending at $v_0$.\n\nConsider a 4-sheeted covering space $p: \\tilde{X} \\to X$. The space $\\tilde{X}$ can be modeled as a directed graph with a set of four vertices $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$. The edges of this graph are also labeled either $a$ or $b$, and are defined as follows:\n- The set of 'a'-labeled edges consists of a single directed 4-cycle: an edge from $v_1$ to $v_2$, an edge from $v_2$ to $v_3$, an edge from $v_3$ to $v_4$, and an edge from $v_4$ to $v_1$.\n- The set of 'b'-labeled edges consists of two loops, one at $v_1$ (from $v_1$ to $v_1$) and one at $v_3$ (from $v_3$ to $v_3$), and a pair of edges forming a directed 2-cycle between $v_2$ and $v_4$ (i.e., an edge from $v_2$ to $v_4$ and an edge from $v_4$ to $v_2$).\n\nThe covering map $p: \\tilde{X} \\to X$ is defined by sending all vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ to the vertex $v_0$ in $X$, and sending all edges labeled 'a' (or 'b') in $\\tilde{X}$ to the loop labeled 'a' (or 'b') in $X$.\n\nA deck transformation (also known as a covering transformation) of this covering is a homeomorphism $\\phi: \\tilde{X} \\to \\tilde{X}$ such that $p \\circ \\phi = p$. These transformations form a group under composition, called the group of deck transformations. Determine the order of this group.", "solution": "A deck transformation $\\phi: \\tilde{X} \\to \\tilde{X}$ is a homeomorphism of the covering space $\\tilde{X}$ that preserves the fibers of the covering map $p$. The condition is $p \\circ \\phi = p$.\n\nIn our graph-based model, the space $\\tilde{X}$ is a directed graph whose edges are labeled 'a' or 'b'. The covering map projects all vertices of $\\tilde{X}$ to the single vertex $v_0$ of $X$, and all edges of a given label in $\\tilde{X}$ to the single edge of that same label in $X$.\n\nThe condition $p \\circ \\phi = p$ implies that a deck transformation must map fibers to fibers. The fiber over the vertex $v_0$ is the set of all vertices in $\\tilde{X}$, which is $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$. Thus, any deck transformation $\\phi$, when restricted to the vertices, must act as a permutation of the set $V$. Let's denote the permutation on the indices $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ by $\\sigma \\in S_4$, such that $\\phi(v_i) = v_{\\sigma(i)}$.\n\nFurthermore, a deck transformation must preserve the structure of the graph $\\tilde{X}$. This means it must be a graph automorphism that also preserves the edge labels. An edge labeled 'a' must be mapped to an edge labeled 'a', and similarly for 'b'.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the permutation $\\sigma$ imposed by the edge structure.\n\n**Constraint 1: Preservation of 'a'-edges**\nThe 'a'-edges form a single directed 4-cycle: $v_1 \\to v_2 \\to v_3 \\to v_4 \\to v_1$.\nAn automorphism of this directed graph must map this cycle to itself. The automorphisms of a directed $n$-cycle form the cyclic group $C_n$. For $n=4$, the group of allowed permutations is generated by the cycle $\\rho = (1234)$. The elements are:\n- $e$ (the identity permutation)\n- $\\rho = (1234)$\n- $\\rho^2 = (13)(24)$\n- $\\rho^3 = (1432)$\nSo, $\\sigma$ must be one of these four permutations.\n\n**Constraint 2: Preservation of 'b'-edges**\nThe 'b'-edges have a different structure:\n- There are loops at vertices $v_1$ and $v_3$.\n- There is a 2-cycle between $v_2$ and $v_4$.\nA deck transformation must preserve this structure. Specifically, it must map the set of vertices with 'b'-loops to itself, and the set of vertices involved in the 'b'-2-cycle to itself.\n- The set of vertices with 'b'-loops is $\\{v_1, v_3\\}$.\n- The set of vertices without 'b'-loops (and thus in the 2-cycle) is $\\{v_2, v_4\\}$.\nTherefore, the permutation $\\sigma$ must satisfy $\\sigma(\\{1, 3\\}) = \\{1, 3\\}$ and $\\sigma(\\{2, 4\\}) = \\{2, 4\\}$.\n\n**Finding the valid deck transformations**\nWe need to find which of the four permutations from Constraint 1 also satisfy Constraint 2.\n\n1.  **$\\sigma = e$**: The identity permutation.\n    - $\\sigma(1)=1, \\sigma(3)=3$, so $\\sigma(\\{1, 3\\}) = \\{1, 3\\}$.\n    - $\\sigma(2)=2, \\sigma(4)=4$, so $\\sigma(\\{2, 4\\}) = \\{2, 4\\}$.\n    - This permutation is valid. It corresponds to the identity transformation, which is always an element of the deck transformation group.\n\n2.  **$\\sigma = (1234)$**:\n    - $\\sigma(1) = 2$. This maps a vertex from the set $\\{1, 3\\}$ to a vertex in the set $\\{2, 4\\}$.\n    - This permutation does not satisfy Constraint 2. It is not a valid deck transformation.\n\n3.  **$\\sigma = (13)(24)$**:\n    - $\\sigma(1) = 3$ and $\\sigma(3) = 1$. So, $\\sigma(\\{1, 3\\}) = \\{3, 1\\} = \\{1, 3\\}$.\n    - $\\sigma(2) = 4$ and $\\sigma(4) = 2$. So, $\\sigma(\\{2, 4\\}) = \\{4, 2\\} = \\{2, 4\\}$.\n    - This permutation satisfies Constraint 2. Since it is also in the group of automorphisms of the 'a'-cycle, we need to check if it preserves the 'b'-edges specifically.\n        - The loop at $v_1$ is mapped to a loop at $\\phi(v_1)=v_3$. There is indeed a 'b'-loop at $v_3$.\n        - The loop at $v_3$ is mapped to a loop at $\\phi(v_3)=v_1$. There is a 'b'-loop at $v_1$.\n        - The edge $v_2 \\to v_4$ is mapped to the edge $\\phi(v_2) \\to \\phi(v_4)$, which is $v_4 \\to v_2$. There is a 'b'-edge from $v_4$ to $v_2$.\n        - The edge $v_4 \\to v_2$ is mapped to the edge $\\phi(v_4) \\to \\phi(v_2)$, which is $v_2 \\to v_4$. There is a 'b'-edge from $v_2$ to $v_4$.\n    - All edge relations are preserved. This permutation is valid and corresponds to a non-trivial deck transformation.\n\n4.  **$\\sigma = (1432)$**:\n    - $\\sigma(1) = 4$. This maps a vertex from $\\{1, 3\\}$ to a vertex in $\\{2, 4\\}$.\n    - This permutation does not satisfy Constraint 2. It is not a valid deck transformation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only permutations that satisfy both constraints are the identity permutation $e$ and the permutation $(13)(24)$. These two transformations form the group of deck transformations. This group is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe order of the group of deck transformations is the number of such valid transformations.
