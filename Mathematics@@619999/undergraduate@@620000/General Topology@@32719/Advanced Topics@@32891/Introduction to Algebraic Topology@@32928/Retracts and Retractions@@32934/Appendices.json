A subset $A \\subseteq X$ is a retract if there exists a continuous map $r: X \\to A$ with $r(a) = a$ for all $a \\in A$.\n\nFirst, we note a fundamental topological fact: if the domain is discrete, then every function from it is continuous. Explicitly, for any function $f: X \\to Y$ and any open set $U \\subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(U) \\subseteq X$ is some subset of $X$, and since every subset of $X$ is open, $f$ is continuous. Therefore, any function $r: X \\to A$ is continuous.\n\nNecessity: If $A$ is a retract of $X$, then there exists a function $r: X \\to A$. Since $X$ is nonempty (it has infinitely many elements), the existence of any function $X \\to A$ requires that $A$ be nonempty. In particular, there is no function from a nonempty set to the empty set, so $A \\neq \\varnothing$ is necessary.\n\nSufficiency: Let $A \\subseteq X$ be nonempty. Choose a point $a_{0} \\in A$ and define a function $r: X \\to A$ by\n$$\nr(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nx,  \\text{if } x \\in A,\\\\\na_{0},  \\text{if } x \\in X \\setminus A.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis $r$ is a well-defined function $X \\to A$, and as established, it is continuous because the domain $X$ is discrete. Moreover, for every $a \\in A$, we have $r(a) = a$, so $r$ is a retraction of $X$ onto $A$.\n\nTherefore, the retracts of $X$ are precisely the nonempty subsets of $X$.

Thus, $A$ is homeomorphic to $X$. Condition 2 is satisfied.\n3.  **Retract:** Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a retraction $r: \\mathbb{R} \\to (0, 1)$.

This sequence converges to $1$. Since $x_n \\in A$ for all $n$, the definition of a retraction requires $r(x_n) = x_n$. By the continuity of $r$ at the point $1$, we must have $r(1) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} r(x_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = 1$. However, the codomain of the retraction map $r$ is the subspace $A = (0, 1)$, and the value $1$ is not in $A$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, no such continuous retraction exists.

Condition 1 is satisfied.\n2.  **Homeomorphic:** The space $X = [-1, 1]$ is connected. The subspace $A = \\{-1, 1\\}$ is not connected; it is a discrete space with two points. Since connectedness is a topological property preserved by homeomorphisms, $X$ and $A$ cannot be homeomorphic.

Condition 1 is satisfied.\n2.  **Homeomorphic:** Consider the map $h: X \\to A$ defined by $h(x) = x+1$. This is a translation, which is continuous. Its inverse map $h^{-1}: A \\to X$ is given by $h^{-1}(y) = y-1$, which is also continuous. Therefore, $h$ is a homeomorphism between $X$ and $A$. Condition 2 is satisfied.\n3.  **Retract:** Consider the map $r: X \\to A$ defined by $r(x) = \\max(1, x)$.\n    -   First, we check that the codomain is correct. For any $x \\in X = [0, \\infty)$, we have $\\max(1, x) \\ge 1$, so $r(x) \\in [1, \\infty) = A$.\n    -   Next, we check the retraction property.

The function $r(x)$ is defined as the maximum of two continuous functions, $f(x)=1$ and $g(x)=x$. The maximum of two continuous real-valued functions is always continuous.

Condition 1 is satisfied.\n2.  **Homeomorphic:** The subspace $A$ is an arc, which is homeomorphic to a closed interval like $[0, 1]$. The space $X = S^1$ is not homeomorphic to an interval. A key difference is that if you remove any point from $S^1$, the remaining space is connected. If you remove any point from the interior of an interval, the space becomes disconnected. Since this property is not shared, they cannot be homeomorphic.

Condition 1 is satisfied.\n2.  **Homeomorphic:** The open disk $A$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A standard homeomorphism is the map $f: A \\to X$ given by $v \\mapsto \\frac{v}{1 - \\|v\\|}$. Condition 2 is satisfied.\n3.  **Retract:** The argument is analogous to Option A. Suppose a retraction $r: X \\to A$ exists. Let $p = (1, 0)$ be a point on the boundary of $A$. Consider a sequence of points $p_n = (1 - 1/n, 0)$ for $n \\ge 2$. Each $p_n$ is in $A$, and the sequence converges to $p$. By the definition of a retraction, $r(p_n) = p_n$. By the continuity of $r$, we must have $r(p) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} r(p_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} p_n = p$. This implies $r(p) = (1, 0)$. However, the codomain of $r$ is $A$, the open unit disk, and $p=(1,0)$ is not in $A$ since its norm is 1. This is a contradiction.
