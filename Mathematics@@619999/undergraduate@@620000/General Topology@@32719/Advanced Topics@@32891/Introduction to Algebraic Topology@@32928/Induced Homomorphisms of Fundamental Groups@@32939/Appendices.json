The group operation in $S^1$ is complex multiplication.\n\nLet the base point of our torus be $p_0 = (1, 1) \\in T^2$. The fundamental group of the torus based at $p_0$, denoted $\\pi_1(T^2, p_0)$, is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of two copies of the integers, $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.
