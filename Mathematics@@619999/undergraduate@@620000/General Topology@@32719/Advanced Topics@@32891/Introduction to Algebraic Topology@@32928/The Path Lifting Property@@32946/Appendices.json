This problem investigates how fundamental operations on paths, such as reversing direction, are reflected in their lifts. Rather than relying on specific formulas, this exercise challenges you to use the powerful concept of the *uniqueness* of path lifts to deduce the answer. Solving it will deepen your understanding of the structural correspondence between paths in the base space and their unique counterparts in the covering space [@problem_id:1585912].", "problem": "In the context of algebraic topology, a covering space of a topological space $B$ is a space $E$ equipped with a continuous surjective map $p: E \\to B$ such that for every point $b \\in B$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $b$ such that its preimage $p^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in $E$, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto $U$ by $p$.\n\nA path in a space $X$ is a continuous map $f: [0,1] \\to X$. The path lifting property states that for a covering map $p: E \\to B$, a path $f: [0,1] \\to B$ in the base space, and a point $e_0 \\in E$ such that $p(e_0) = f(0)$, there exists a unique path $\\tilde{f}: [0,1] \\to E$ called the lift of $f$, which satisfies two conditions: $\\tilde{f}(0) = e_0$ and $p \\circ \\tilde{f} = f$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{f}$ be the unique lift of a path $f: [0,1] \\to B$ starting at some point $e_0 \\in E$. Now, consider the reverse path of $f$, denoted by $\\bar{f}$, which is defined by the formula $\\bar{f}(t) = f(1-t)$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$. The starting point of this reverse path is $\\bar{f}(0) = f(1)$. A lift of $\\bar{f}$ must therefore start in the fiber $p^{-1}(f(1))$.

Since $\\bar{f}$ is the reverse of $f$, a natural candidate for its lift is the reverse of the original lift $\\tilde{f}$.

Verification of Continuity:**\nThe original lift $\\tilde{f}: [0,1] \\to E$ is a path, so it is continuous by definition. The function $h(t) = 1-t$ is a continuous map from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$. Our candidate path $g(t) = \\tilde{f}(1-t) = (\\tilde{f} \\circ h)(t)$ is a composition of two continuous functions. The composition of continuous functions is continuous, so $g(t)$ is continuous.\n\n**2. Verification of the Starting Point:**\nWe need to check the value of $g(t)$ at $t=0$.\n$$g(0) = \\tilde{f}(1-0) = \\tilde{f}(1)$$\nThis matches the required starting point for the lift of $\\bar{f}$, so the second condition is satisfied.\n\n**3. Verification of the Lifting Condition:**\nWe need to check if $p(g(t)) = \\bar{f}(t)$. Let's apply the covering map $p$ to our candidate path $g(t)$:\n$$p(g(t)) = p(\\tilde{f}(1-t))$$\nWe know that $\\tilde{f}$ is a lift of $f$, which means $p(\\tilde{f}(s)) = f(s)$ for any $s \\in [0,1]$. Let's use this property with $s = 1-t$.\n$$p(\\tilde{f}(1-t)) = f(1-t)$$\nThe problem statement defines the reverse path $\\bar{f}$ as $\\bar{f}(t) = f(1-t)$. Substituting this into our equation gives:\n$$p(g(t)) = \\bar{f}(t)$$\nThis shows that our candidate path $g(t)$ indeed projects down to the reverse path $\\bar{f}$.\n\nSince our proposed path $g(t) = \\tilde{f}(1-t)$ satisfies all three conditions (continuity, correct starting point, and the lifting condition), and since the path lifting property guarantees such a lift is unique, we must have:\n$$\\tilde{\\bar{f}}(t) = g(t) = \\tilde{f}(1-t)$$\nThus, the lift of the reverse path is the reverse of the original lift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\tilde{f}(1-t)}$$", "id": "1585912"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts our focus from the continuous, infinite cover of the circle to a finite, combinatorial covering of the figure-eight space.
