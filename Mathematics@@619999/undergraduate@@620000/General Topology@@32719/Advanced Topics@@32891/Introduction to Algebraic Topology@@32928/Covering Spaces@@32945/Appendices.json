The rank of a free group is the number of generators in a minimal generating set.\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks for the rank of the fundamental group of a covering space $E$. The space $E$ is described as a graph. For a connected graph, the fundamental group is a free group, and its rank can be calculated using the formula involving the number of vertices and edges.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of vertices and edges of the graph $E$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of vertices of E.**\nThe problem statement explicitly defines the set of vertices of $E$ as the fiber over the single vertex $x_0$ of the base space $X$. This set is given as $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$.\nTherefore, the number of vertices is $|V| = 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of edges of E.**\nThe edges of $E$ are the lifts of the loops $a$ and $b$ from the base space $X$. For each of the 3 vertices in $E$, there is a unique lift of loop $a$ and a unique lift of loop $b$. This gives a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ edges in $E$.\nLet's list them based on the description:\n1.  Lift of $a$ starting at $v_1$: An edge $e_{a,1}: v_1 \\to v_2$.\n2.  Lift of $a$ starting at $v_2$: An edge $e_{a,2}: v_2 \\to v_1$.\n3.  Lift of $a$ starting at $v_3$: An edge $e_{a,3}: v_3 \\to v_3$ (a loop).\n4.  Lift of $b$ starting at $v_1$: An edge $e_{b,1}: v_1 \\to v_3$.\n5.  Lift of $b$ starting at $v_2$: An edge $e_{b,2}: v_2 \\to v_2$ (a loop).\n6.  Lift of $b$ starting at $v_3$: An edge $e_{b,3}: v_3 \\to v_1$.\nSo, the total number of edges is $|E| = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the rank of the fundamental group of E.**\nThe fundamental group of a connected graph $G$ is a free group. Its rank is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_1(G)) = |E| - |V| + 1 $$\nWe are given that the space $E$ is connected.
