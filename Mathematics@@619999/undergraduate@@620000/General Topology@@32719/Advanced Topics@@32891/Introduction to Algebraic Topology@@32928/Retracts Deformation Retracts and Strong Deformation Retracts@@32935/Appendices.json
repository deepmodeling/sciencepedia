Let $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and $A$ be a subspace of $X$.

Let $X$ have the indiscrete topology and $A \\subseteq X$ be nonempty. A carries the subspace topology. The open sets in $X$ are $\\emptyset$ and $X$. Thus, the open sets in $A$ are $A \\cap \\emptyset = \\emptyset$ and $A \\cap X = A$. So $A$ also has the indiscrete topology. A function $r: X \\to A$ is continuous if for every open set $U \\subseteq A$, its preimage $r^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Since the only open sets in $A$ are $\\emptyset$ and $A$, their preimages under any map $r$ must be $\\emptyset$ and $X$ respectively. Both $\\emptyset$ and $X$ are open in the indiscrete topology of $X$. Thus, any function $r: X \\to A$ is continuous. We can define $r$ by picking an element $a_0 \\in A$, setting $r(a)=a$ for all $a \\in A$ and $r(x)=a_0$ for all $x \\in X \\setminus A$. This map is continuous and satisfies $r|_{A}=\\operatorname{id}_{A}$, so $A$ is a retract. Hence A is true.\n\nB. Let $X$ be discrete and $A \\subseteq X$ nonempty. $A$ also carries the discrete topology as a subspace. For any function $r: X \\to A$ and any open set $U \\subseteq A$, its preimage $r^{-1}(U)$ is a subset of $X$. In the discrete topology, every subset of $X$ is open, so $r^{-1}(U)$ is guaranteed to be open. Thus, any function from a discrete space is continuous. We can define $r$ by picking an element $a_0 \\in A$, setting $r(a)=a$ for all $a \\in A$ and $r(x)=a_0$ for all $x \\in X \\setminus A$.

Let $X=[0,1] \\cup [2,3]$ with the subspace topology from $\\mathbb{R}$ and $A=\\{0,3\\}$. Note that $[0,1]$ and $[2,3]$ are clopen in $X$. For instance, $[0,1] = X \\cap (-1, 1.5)$ is open in $X$, and its complement in $X$ is $[2,3]$, which must also be open. Thus both are closed as well.

The preimages of the open sets are $r^{-1}(\\{0\\})=[0,1]$ and $r^{-1}(\\{3\\})=[2,3]$. Since both $[0,1]$ and $[2,3]$ are open in $X$, the map $r$ is continuous.

The only connected subsets of a discrete space are single points. Therefore, any continuous map from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$ must be a constant map. A constant map cannot satisfy the condition $r(n)=n$ for all integers $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, since $\\mathbb{Z}$ has more than one point. Thus, no such retraction exists.

This is because the preimage of any set will be a subset of $X$, and all subsets of $X$ are open. Let's fix an arbitrary element $a_{0}\\in A$ (which is possible since $A$ is non-empty) and define a map $r: X \\to A$ by:\n$$\nr(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\nx, & x\\in A,\\\\\na_{0}, & x\\in X\\setminus A.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis map is continuous.

Statement (i) is true.\n\nStatements (ii) and (iii): Let $F: X\\times I \\to X$ be any homotopy on $X$. The domain includes the product space $X \\times I$. For any fixed point $x \\in X$, the subset $\\{x\\} \\times I$ is homeomorphic to the unit interval $I$, which is a connected space. Since $F$ is continuous, the image $F(\\{x\\} \\times I)$ must be a connected subset of $X$. However, $X$ is endowed with the discrete topology, where the only connected subsets are single points. Therefore, the image $F(\\{x\\} \\times I)$ must be a singleton for each $x$. This means that for any fixed $x$, the map $t \\mapsto F(x,t)$ is constant.\nSo, for all $t \\in I$, we must have $F(x,t) = F(x,0)$.\n\nFor a deformation retraction, we require $F(x,0)=x$. Combining this with our finding, we get $F(x,t)=x$ for all $x \\in X$ and $t \\in I$.\nThis implies that at time $t=1$, we have $F(x,1)=x$. The condition for a deformation retraction is that $F(x,1) \\in A$ for all $x \\in X$.\nThis would mean that for all $x \\in X$, we have $x \\in A$. This implies $X \\subseteq A$. However, we are given that $A$ is a *proper* subset of $X$, meaning $A \\neq X$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, no such homotopy $F$ can exist, and $A$ cannot be a deformation retract of $X$.\nSince a strong deformation retraction is a specific type of deformation retraction, it cannot exist either.
