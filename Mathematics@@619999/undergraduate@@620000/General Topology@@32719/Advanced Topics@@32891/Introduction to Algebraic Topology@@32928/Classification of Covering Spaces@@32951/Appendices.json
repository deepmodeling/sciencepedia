Whether the covering space is normal or not depends on the specific choice of the base point $x_0$.", "solution": "Let $X=S^{1}\\vee S^{1}$ with basepoint $x_{0}$. Then $\\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\\cong F_{2}=\\langle a,b\\rangle$. For connected, locally path-connected, semilocally simply connected spaces (which $X$ is), the Galois correspondence identifies connected covering spaces of $X$ with conjugacy classes of subgroups $H\\leq \\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$. Moreover:\n- The covering corresponding to $H$ is normal if and only if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $\\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$.\n- The universal covering corresponds to the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\n\nHere $H=\\langle aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\rangle=\\langle [a,b]\\rangle$. First, $[a,b]\\neq 1$ in the free group $F_{2}$, so $H\\neq \\{1\\}$ and hence the covering is not the universal cover.\n\nTo determine normality, suppose for contradiction that $H$ is normal in $F_{2}$. Let $N$ denote the normal closure of $[a,b]$ in $F_{2}$. By definition $N$ is the smallest normal subgroup containing $[a,b]$. If $H$ were normal and generated by $[a,b]$, then $H=N$.\n\nConsider the abelianization homomorphism $\\phi\\colon F_{2}\\to \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ given by $\\phi(a)=(1,0)$ and $\\phi(b)=(0,1)$. Its kernel is the commutator subgroup $[F_{2},F_{2}]$. Since $\\phi([a,b])=0$, the normal closure $N$ is contained in $[F_{2},F_{2}]$. Conversely, in the quotient $F_{2}/N$ the relation $[a,b]=1$ holds. Because $F_{2}$ is generated by $a$ and $b$, imposing $[a,b]=1$ forces $F_{2}/N$ to be abelian, so $[F_{2},F_{2}]\\subseteq N$. Therefore $N=[F_{2},F_{2}]$.\n\nHence, if $H$ were normal, we would have $H=N=[F_{2},F_{2}]$. But $H$ is cyclic, while $[F_{2},F_{2}]$ is not cyclic (indeed, it is a free group of countable rank), a contradiction. Therefore $H$ is not normal, and the corresponding covering is not normal.\n\nFinally, changing the basepoint replaces $H$ by a conjugate subgroup. Normality is invariant under conjugation: if $K=gHg^{-1}$ is normal, then for any $y$, $yHy^{-1}=g^{-1}(yg)K(g^{-1}y^{-1}g)g^{-1}=H$, so $H$ would be normal, and conversely. Thus the normality of the covering does not depend on the choice of basepoint.\n\nTherefore, among the options:\n- A is false (the covering is not normal).\n- B is true.\n- C is false (the cover is not universal since $H\\neq \\{1\\}$).\n- D is false (normality does not depend on the basepoint).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1536601"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how algebraic properties of subgroups define the nature of a covering, we now turn the tables to see how this framework can reveal the topology of the covering space itself.
