Consider the continuous map $f: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ given by the polynomial function $f(x,y,z) = (x^2 + y + z, x + y^2)$. The Borsuk-Ulam theorem guarantees that there exists at least one pair of antipodal points, $p$ and $-p$, on $S^2$ such that $f(p) = f(-p)$. Your task is to explicitly find these points.

We can define a function $f: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ that assigns a unique coordinate pair to each point $P$ on the surface. Let this a coordinate pair be $(l, \\lambda)$, where $l$ is the latitude and $\\lambda$ is the longitude. The latitude $l$ is defined to be in the range $[-90^\\circ, 90^\\circ]$, with $-90^\\circ$ at the South Pole and $90^\\circ$ at the North Pole. The longitude $\\lambda$ is defined to be in the range $[-180^\\circ, 180^\\circ)$, where negative values represent degrees west of the Prime Meridian and positive values represent degrees east. The longitude $180^\\circ$ is identified with the International Date Line.\n\nThe Borsuk-Ulam theorem, in the case of the 2-sphere, states: \"For any continuous function $g: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, there exists at least one point $x \\in S^2$ such that $g(x) = g(-x)$, where $-x$ is the point antipodal to $x$.\"\n\nApplying this theorem to the function $f(P) = (l, \\lambda)$ seems to suggest that there must be a pair of antipodal points on Earth that are assigned the exact same latitude and longitude coordinates.

The domain of the function, the Earth, is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, which is not homeomorphic to $S^2$.", "solution": "We recall the hypothesis needed to invoke the Borsuk-Ulam theorem in the case of the 2-sphere: the map must be continuous. That is, given a continuous map $g: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, there exists $x \\in S^2$ with $g(x) = g(-x)$. Therefore, to apply the theorem to the latitude-longitude mapping $f: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, the function $f$ must be continuous.\n\nDefine $f(P) = (l(P), \\lambda(P))$, where $l$ is latitude in $[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ and $\\lambda$ is longitude in $[-\\pi, \\pi)$. We show that $f$ is not continuous due to the longitude coordinate.\n\nFirst, the longitude coordinate has a jump discontinuity along the International Date Line (the meridian identified with both longitude $180^\\circ$ W and $180^\\circ$ E). Consider a point $P_0$ on this meridian away from the poles. A point approaching $P_0$ from the west will have its longitude approach the upper end of the range, $180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians). However, the range for longitude is defined as $[-180^\\circ, 180^\\circ)$, which excludes $180^\\circ$. A point just across the line to the east will have its longitude near $-180^\\circ$ (or $-\\pi$ radians). Geometrically, two sequences of points can converge to the same point $P_0$ on the sphere, but their longitude values will converge to different numbers ($\\pi$ and $-\\pi$). Since the limits are not equal, the function is not continuous at any point on this line.\n\nSecond, at the poles the longitude is not well-defined geometrically (all longitudes meet at each pole). Any single-valued assignment of longitude to the North Pole, say $\\lambda(N)$, forces a discontinuity. Take a sequence of points approaching the North Pole along any meridian other than the one chosen for the pole's longitude. For instance, if $\\lambda(N) = 0^\\circ$, a sequence approaching along the $180^\\circ$ meridian will have longitudes approaching $180^\\circ$ or $-180^\\circ$, not $0^\\circ$. Thus, the longitude coordinate is discontinuous at the poles as well. In contrast, the latitude coordinate $l$ is continuous everywhere on $S^2$, including at the poles.\n\nTherefore, the necessary continuity hypothesis for the Borsuk-Ulam theorem fails for $f$, specifically because the longitude mapping has a discontinuity. This invalidates the direct application of the theorem. The other proposed reasons are incorrect: the latitude mapping is continuous; the target space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the correct codomain for the theorem and need not be compact; and the problem explicitly assumes a perfect sphere, but even if the Earth were an oblate spheroid, it is still homeomorphic to $S^2$, so the theorem would apply if the map were continuous.\n\nThus the correct choice is the statement that the function $f$ is not continuous because the longitude mapping has a discontinuity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1634280"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a fundamental theorem often lies in its ability to prove other, seemingly unrelated results.
