Let $X$ be a non-empty set. A collection $\\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a filter on $X$ if it satisfies the following three axioms:\n1.  $\\mathcal{F}$ is a non-empty collection of subsets, and the empty set $\\emptyset$ is not an element of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n2.  If $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $A \\subseteq B \\subseteq X$, then $B \\in \\mathcal{F}$. This property is known as being upward-closed.\n3.  If $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}$. This property means the collection is closed under finite intersections.\n\nConsider the finite set $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$. How many distinct filters can be defined on the set $X$?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 7\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 9\n\nE. 27", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct collections of subsets of $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$ that satisfy the three axioms of a filter.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be a filter on a finite set $X$.\nAccording to axiom 1, $\\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty. Since $X$ is a finite set, its power set $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is also finite. A filter $\\mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{P}(X)$, so $\\mathcal{F}$ must be a finite collection of sets. Let's say $\\mathcal{F} = \\{S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_k\\}$.\n\nAccording to axiom 3, a filter is closed under finite intersections. Since $\\mathcal{F}$ is a finite collection, we can take the intersection of all sets within it. Let $B_0 = S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap S_k$. Because of the closure under intersection property, this resulting set $B_0$ must also be an element of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nBy the definition of intersection, $B_0$ is a subset of every set $S_i$ in $\\mathcal{F}$. This means $B_0$ is the smallest set in $\\mathcal{F}$ with respect to the subset relation $\\subseteq$.\n\nFurthermore, according to axiom 2, if a set is in the filter, all of its supersets (that are subsets of $X$) must also be in the filter. Since $B_0 \\in \\mathcal{F}$, every superset of $B_0$ must also be in $\\mathcal{F}$. This implies $\\{A \\subseteq X \\mid B_0 \\subseteq A\\} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nCombining these observations, every set $S \\in \\mathcal{F}$ must be a superset of $B_0$. Thus, $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\{A \\subseteq X \\mid B_0 \\subseteq A\\}$.\nThis leads to the conclusion that $\\mathcal{F}$ must be exactly the collection of all supersets of its smallest element $B_0$. That is, $\\mathcal{F} = \\{A \\subseteq X \\mid B_0 \\subseteq A\\}$.\nSuch a filter, which is generated by a single set $B_0$, is called a principal filter. Our reasoning shows that every filter on a finite set is a principal filter.\n\nAccording to axiom 1, the empty set $\\emptyset$ cannot be in $\\mathcal{F}$. The only way $\\emptyset$ could be in our collection $\\mathcal{F} = \\{A \\subseteq X \\mid B_0 \\subseteq A\\}$ is if $B_0$ itself is the empty set, because any set is a superset of $\\emptyset$. To satisfy axiom 1, the generating set $B_0$ must be non-empty.\n\nThus, we have established a one-to-one correspondence: every filter on the finite set $X$ corresponds to a unique non-empty subset of $X$ that generates it. The number of distinct filters on $X$ is therefore equal to the number of non-empty subsets of $X$.\n\nThe given set is $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$. The number of elements in $X$ is $|X| = 3$.\nThe total number of subsets of $X$ is given by the size of its power set, $|\\mathcal{P}(X)| = 2^{|X|} = 2^3 = 8$.\nThese 8 subsets are:\n$\\emptyset$, $\\{a\\}$, $\\{b\\}$, $\\{c\\}$, $\\{a, b\\}$, $\\{a, c\\}$, $\\{b, c\\}$, and $\\{a, b, c\\}$.\n\nWe are interested in the number of *non-empty* subsets. This is the total number of subsets minus one (for the empty set).\nNumber of non-empty subsets = $2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\n\nEach of these 7 non-empty subsets generates a distinct filter. For example:\n- The subset $\\{a\\}$ generates the filter $\\mathcal{F}_{\\{a\\}} = \\{\\{a\\}, \\{a,b\\}, \\{a,c\\}, \\{a,b,c\\}\\}$.\n- The subset $\\{a, b\\}$ generates the filter $\\mathcal{F}_{\\{a,b\\}} = \\{\\{a,b\\}, \\{a,b,c\\}\\}$.\n- The subset $\\{a, b, c\\}$ generates the filter $\\mathcal{F}_{\\{a,b,c\\}} = \\{\\{a,b,c\\}\\}$.\n\nSince there are 7 non-empty subsets of $X$, there are exactly 7 distinct filters on $X$.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. 3\nB. 7\nC. 8\nD. 9\nE. 27\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1553415"}, {"introduction": "Having explored filters on finite sets, we now shift from classification to construction.

We will first check if $\\mathcal{F}$ is a filter by verifying the three axioms, and then we will check if it is closed under countable intersections.\n\nFirst, let's verify the filter axioms for $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n1.  **Does $\\mathcal{F}$ contain the empty set?**\n    A set $A$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$ if its complement $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ is finite. If we consider the empty set $A = \\emptyset$, its complement is $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\emptyset = \\mathbb{N}$. The set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ is infinite. Therefore, the complement of the empty set is not finite, which means $\\emptyset \\notin \\mathcal{F}$. The first axiom is satisfied. This also eliminates option E. We should also note that $\\mathcal{F}$ itself is not empty. For example, the set $A = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{1\\}$ has a finite complement $\\{1\\}$, so $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n\n2.  **Is $\\mathcal{F}$ closed under finite intersections?**\n    Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets in $\\mathcal{F}$. By definition, their complements, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ and $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus B$, are both finite. We need to check if the intersection $A \\cap B$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}$. This is equivalent to checking if the complement of the intersection, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus (A \\cap B)$, is finite.\n    Using De Morgan's laws for sets, we have:\n    $$ \\mathbb{N} \\setminus (A \\cap B) = (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A) \\cup (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus B) $$\n    Since $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ and $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus B$ are both finite sets, their union is also a finite set. Thus, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus (A \\cap B)$ is finite, which implies that $A \\cap B \\in \\mathcal{F}$. The second axiom is satisfied. This eliminates option C.\n\n3.  **Is $\\mathcal{F}$ upwardly closed?**\n    Let $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and let $C$ be a set such that $A \\subseteq C \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$. We need to show that $C \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n    Since $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, its complement $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ is finite.\n    The condition $A \\subseteq C$ implies that $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus C \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$.\n    Since $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A$ is a finite set, any of its subsets must also be finite. Therefore, $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus C$ is finite.\n    By the definition of $\\mathcal{F}$, this means $C \\in \\mathcal{F}$. The third axiom is satisfied. This eliminates option D.\n\nSince all three filter axioms are satisfied, we conclude that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a filter on $\\mathbb{N}$. This type of filter is known as the Fréchet filter or the cofinite filter.\n\nNow, we must check if $\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable intersections. This property would mean that for any countable sequence of sets $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$ where each $A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}$, their intersection $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i$ must also be in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nLet's test this with a specific counterexample. For each natural number $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, define the set $A_i$ as:\n$$ A_i = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{i\\} $$\nFor each $A_i$, its complement is $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus A_i = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{i\\}) = \\{i\\}$. Since $\\{i\\}$ is a finite set (it contains only one element), each $A_i$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$. So, $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$ is a countable sequence of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nNow, let's compute their intersection:\n$$ A = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} (\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{i\\}) $$\nAn element $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is in the intersection $A$ if and only if $x \\in A_i$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This means $x \\neq i$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$. However, the set of all $i$ is $\\mathbb{N}$ itself. So, an element $x \\in A$ must not be any natural number. Since we are working within the universe of natural numbers $X=\\mathbb{N}$, there is no such element. Therefore, the intersection is the empty set:\n$$ A = \\emptyset $$\nWe need to check if this resulting intersection is in $\\mathcal{F}$.
