Recall that a filter $\\mathcal{F}$ on $S$ is closed under finite intersections and supersets, contains $S$, and does not contain $\\emptyset$. An ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ is a maximal filter, equivalently satisfying that for every $A \\subseteq S$, either $A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ or $S \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{U}$.\n\nFirst, we prove a basic fact used repeatedly: if $\\mathcal{F}$ is a filter on a finite set $S$, then the intersection of all sets in $\\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty. Suppose, toward a contradiction, that $\\bigcap_{F \\in \\mathcal{F}} F = \\emptyset$. Then for each $s \\in S$ there exists $F_{s} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with $s \\notin F_{s}$.

Therefore,\n$$\n\\bigcap_{F \\in \\mathcal{F}} F \\neq \\emptyset.\n$$\nIn particular, for any ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on $S$, we have $\\bigcap_{U \\in \\mathcal{U}} U \\neq \\emptyset$. Moreover, for an ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on finite $S$, this intersection is actually a singleton, implying every ultrafilter on $S$ is principal: if $x \\in \\bigcap_{U \\in \\mathcal{U}} U$ and $y \\neq x$, apply the ultrafilter property to $S \\setminus \\{y\\}$ to deduce $\\{y\\} \\notin \\mathcal{U}$, hence $y$ is not in the intersection; thus the intersection equals $\\{x\\}$.\n\nNow evaluate each statement:\n\nA. False in general. On $|S| \\geq 2$, take a proper subset $A \\subset S$ with $|A| \\geq 2$. The principal filter generated by $A$, namely $\\{B \\subseteq S : A \\subseteq B\\}$, is a filter but not an ultrafilter.

Then $B = \\{s_{1}\\} \\notin \\mathcal{F}$ and $S \\setminus B = \\{s_{2}, s_{3}\\} \\notin \\mathcal{F}$, so the ultrafilter criterion fails.\n\nB. True. As proved above, for any filter on finite $S$, and hence for any ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ in particular, the intersection $\\bigcap_{U \\in \\mathcal{U}} U$ is non-empty. In fact, for ultrafilters on finite sets, this intersection is exactly a singleton, so it is certainly non-empty.\n\nC. False. A free ultrafilter is one whose intersection over all its members is empty. This cannot occur on finite $S$ by the argument at the start, so no free ultrafilter exists on a finite set.\n\nD. False. On finite $S$, every subset has a finite complement, so the collection of all cofinite subsets equals $\\mathcal{P}(S)$, which contains $\\emptyset$. Since a filter cannot contain $\\emptyset$, this collection is not even a filter, hence not an ultrafilter.\n\nE. False. If $|S| = 2$ and $s_{1} \\neq s_{2}$, every ultrafilter on $S$ is principal, generated by one of the two points, and therefore contains the corresponding singleton.

A standard property is that a non-principal ultrafilter on an infinite set contains no finite set. Hence, for any finite set $F \\subseteq X$, we have $F \\notin \\mathcal{U}$. Since $\\mathcal{U}$ is an ultrafilter, for any $A \\subseteq X$ either $A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ or $X \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{U}$.

Now fix any $x \\in X$. If $U \\in \\mathcal{N}(x)$, then $U$ is cofinite, hence $U \\in \\mathcal{U}$. Thus $\\mathcal{N}(x) \\subseteq \\mathcal{U}$, so $\\mathcal{U}$ converges to $x$. Since $x$ was arbitrary, a non-principal ultrafilter converges to every point of $X$, and its set of limit points is $X$.\n\nNext, consider a principal ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}_{p}=\\{A \\subseteq X \\mid p \\in A\\}$ at a point $p \\in X$. For $x=p$, take any $U \\in \\mathcal{N}(p)$. Then $p \\in U$, so $U \\in \\mathcal{U}_{p}$, hence $\\mathcal{U}_{p}$ converges to $p$. For $x \\in X$ with $x \\neq p$, consider the neighborhood\n$$\nV=X \\setminus \\{p\\}.\n$$\nThen $x \\in V$, $X \\setminus V=\\{p\\}$ is finite, so $V \\in \\mathcal{N}(x)$.
