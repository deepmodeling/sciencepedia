Since $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is finite, $\\mathcal{U}\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is finite. By filter axiom (2) and induction, the intersection of any finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{U}$ is in $\\mathcal{U}$.

First, for any $A\\in\\mathcal{U}$, we have $I\\subseteq A$ and $x\\in I$, hence $x\\in A$, so $\\mathcal{U}\\subseteq\\mathcal{U}_{x}$. Conversely, let $A\\subseteq X$ with $x\\in A$.

Therefore $A\\in\\mathcal{U}$, and hence $\\mathcal{U}_{x}\\subseteq\\mathcal{U}$.\n\nThus every ultrafilter on $X$ is principal, and the map $x\\mapsto\\mathcal{U}_{x}$ is a bijection between $X$ and the set of ultrafilters.
