Also $x(n)<1$ since $x(n)\\leq L<1$. For positivity, note $3<4$ implies $\\sqrt{3}<2$, hence $L=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}>\\frac{1}{2}$, so for $n\\geq 1$ we have $10^{n}L\\geq 10^{n}/2\\geq 5$, and thus $\\lfloor 10^{n}L\\rfloor\\geq 5$, which yields $x(n)>0$. Therefore $x(n)\\in A$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+}$.\n\nTo prove convergence, use the floor inequality: for any real $y$,\n$$\n\\lfloor y\\rfloor\\leq y<\\lfloor y\\rfloor+1.\n$$\nWith $y=10^{n}L$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\lfloor 10^{n}L\\rfloor}{10^{n}}\\leq L<\\frac{\\lfloor 10^{n}L\\rfloor+1}{10^{n}},\n$$\nso\n$$\n0\\leq L-x(n)<\\frac{1}{10^{n}}.\n$$\nHence $x(n)\\to L$. Therefore option C gives a net in $A$ converging to $L$. Option C is correct.\n\nCheck option D: The index set is $D$, the collection of all open intervals containing $L$, with the order relation $\\subseteq$. This forms a directed set, since for any $I, J \\in D$, their union $I \\cup J$ is also in $D$ and serves as an upper bound. However, for the net to converge to $L$, for any neighborhood $U$ of $L$, there must exist an $I_0 \\in D$ such that for all $I \\supseteq I_0$, we have $x(I) \\in U$. This condition fails because \"going further\" along the net means taking *larger* intervals. No matter which $I_0$ we pick, we can always choose a larger interval $I \\supset I_0$. Since $A$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, this larger interval $I$ contains points of $A$ that are outside of $U$. As $x(I)$ is chosen arbitrarily from $I \\cap A$, there is no guarantee it will land in $U$. The standard net construction that uses neighborhoods to converge requires the order to be reverse inclusion ($\\supseteq$), so that \"going further\" means taking smaller, more restrictive neighborhoods.
