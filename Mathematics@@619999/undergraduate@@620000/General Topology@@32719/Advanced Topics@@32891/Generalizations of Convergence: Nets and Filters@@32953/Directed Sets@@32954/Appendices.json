That is, for each pair of indices $(i,j)$:\n$$l_{ij} \\geq \\max(a_{ij}, b_{ij})$$\nThe problem asks for the *least* upper bound. This means we must find the smallest possible values for the entries $l_{ij}$ that still satisfy the condition of being an upper bound. The smallest value that is greater than or equal to two numbers is their maximum. Therefore, the entries of the least upper bound $L$ are given precisely by:\n$$l_{ij} = \\max(a_{ij}, b_{ij})$$\nWe now apply this to the specific matrices given:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 5  \\frac{13}{4} \\\\ e  2\\pi \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{26}  3 \\\\ 2  7 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe compute each entry of the least upper bound matrix $L = \\begin{pmatrix} l_{11}  l_{12} \\\\ l_{21}  l_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ by taking the maximum of the corresponding entries of $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor the entry $l_{11}$:\n$l_{11} = \\max(a_{11}, b_{11}) = \\max(5, \\sqrt{26})$.\nTo compare these two numbers, we can compare their squares: $5^2 = 25$ and $(\\sqrt{26})^2 = 26$.
