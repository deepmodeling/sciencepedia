Select all that apply.", "solution": "To determine which of the collections are filter bases, we must check each one against the three defining properties of a filter base. Let $X = C[0,1]$.\n\n**Analysis of Collection A:**\n$\\mathcal{A} = \\{ A_\\epsilon : \\epsilon > 0 \\}$, where $A_\\epsilon = \\{ f \\in X : |f(0)|  \\epsilon \\}$.\n\n1.  **Non-empty collection**: The indexing set $\\{\\epsilon : \\epsilon > 0\\}$ is non-empty, so the collection $\\mathcal{A}$ is non-empty.\n2.  **Non-empty sets**: For any $\\epsilon > 0$, the zero function $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$ is continuous. We have $|f(0)| = |0| = 0  \\epsilon$. Thus, the zero function is in $A_\\epsilon$, which means $A_\\epsilon$ is not empty.\n3.  **Intersection property**: Let $A_{\\epsilon_1}, A_{\\epsilon_2}$ be two arbitrary sets in $\\mathcal{A}$, where $\\epsilon_1 > 0$ and $\\epsilon_2 > 0$. The intersection is:\n    $A_{\\epsilon_1} \\cap A_{\\epsilon_2} = \\{ f \\in X : |f(0)|  \\epsilon_1 \\text{ and } |f(0)|  \\epsilon_2 \\}$\n    This is equivalent to $\\{ f \\in X : |f(0)|  \\min(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2) \\}$.\n    Let $\\epsilon_3 = \\min(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2)$. Since $\\epsilon_1 > 0$ and $\\epsilon_2 > 0$, we have $\\epsilon_3 > 0$. Therefore, the set $A_{\\epsilon_3} = \\{ f \\in X : |f(0)|  \\epsilon_3 \\}$ is an element of $\\mathcal{A}$.\n    By definition, $A_{\\epsilon_3} = A_{\\epsilon_1} \\cap A_{\\epsilon_2}$. Thus, the condition $A_{\\epsilon_3} \\subseteq A_{\\epsilon_1} \\cap A_{\\epsilon_2}$ is satisfied.\n\nAll three properties hold. Therefore, $\\mathcal{A}$ is a filter base.\n\n**Analysis of Collection B:**\n$\\mathcal{B} = \\{ B_M : M > 0 \\}$, where $B_M = \\{ f \\in X : f(x) > M \\text{ for all } x \\in [0, 1] \\}$.\n\n1.  **Non-empty collection**: The indexing set $\\{M : M > 0\\}$ is non-empty, so $\\mathcal{B}$ is non-empty.\n2.  **Non-empty sets**: For any $M > 0$, consider the constant function $f(x) = M + 1$. This function is continuous. For all $x \\in [0,1]$, $f(x) = M+1 > M$. So $f \\in B_M$, which means $B_M$ is not empty.\n3.  **Intersection property**: Let $B_{M_1}, B_{M_2}$ be two sets in $\\mathcal{B}$, with $M_1 > 0, M_2 > 0$. The intersection is:\n    $B_{M_1} \\cap B_{M_2} = \\{ f \\in X : f(x) > M_1 \\text{ and } f(x) > M_2 \\text{ for all } x \\in [0, 1] \\}$\n    This is equivalent to $\\{ f \\in X : f(x) > \\max(M_1, M_2) \\text{ for all } x \\in [0, 1] \\}$.\n    Let $M_3 = \\max(M_1, M_2)$. Since $M_1 > 0$ and $M_2 > 0$, we have $M_3 > 0$. The set $B_{M_3} = \\{ f \\in X : f(x) > M_3 \\text{ for all } x \\in [0, 1] \\}$ is in $\\mathcal{B}$.\n    We have $B_{M_3} = B_{M_1} \\cap B_{M_2}$, so the condition $B_{M_3} \\subseteq B_{M_1} \\cap B_{M_2}$ is satisfied.\n\nAll three properties hold. Therefore, $\\mathcal{B}$ is a filter base.\n\n**Analysis of Collection C:**\n$\\mathcal{C} = \\{ C_p : p \\in [0, 1] \\}$, where $C_p = \\{ f \\in X : f(p) \\ge 1 \\}$.\n\n1.  **Non-empty collection**: The indexing set $[0, 1]$ is non-empty.\n2.  **Non-empty sets**: For any $p \\in [0, 1]$, the constant function $f(x) = 1$ is continuous and satisfies $f(p) = 1 \\ge 1$. So $f \\in C_p$, and thus $C_p$ is not empty.\n3.  **Intersection property**: Let's test this property with two distinct points, say $p_1 = 0$ and $p_2 = 1$. The corresponding sets are $C_0 = \\{ f \\in X : f(0) \\ge 1 \\}$ and $C_1 = \\{ f \\in X : f(1) \\ge 1 \\}$. The intersection is $C_0 \\cap C_1 = \\{ f \\in X : f(0) \\ge 1 \\text{ and } f(1) \\ge 1 \\}$.\n    For $\\mathcal{C}$ to be a filter base, there must exist some $p_3 \\in [0, 1]$ such that $C_{p_3} \\subseteq C_0 \\cap C_1$. This means that for any function $g \\in C_{p_3}$ (i.e., $g(p_3) \\ge 1$), it must also be true that $g \\in C_0 \\cap C_1$ (i.e., $g(0) \\ge 1$ and $g(1) \\ge 1$).\n    Let's show this is false for any choice of $p_3$.\n    Consider the function $g(x) = \\cos(\\pi(x-p_3))$. This function is continuous. We have $g(p_3) = \\cos(0) = 1$, so $g \\in C_{p_3}$.\n    However, if we choose $p_3 = 0.5$, then $g(x) = \\cos(\\pi(x-0.5)) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. We have $g(0.5) = 1$, so $g \\in C_{0.5}$. But $g(0) = \\sin(0) = 0  1$, so $g \\notin C_0$. Thus $C_{0.5} \\not\\subseteq C_0 \\cap C_1$.\n    More generally, for any $p_3 \\in [0, 1]$, we can find a function in $C_{p_3}$ that is not in $C_0 \\cap C_1$. For example, if $p_3 \\neq 1$, consider the linear function $g(x) = \\frac{1-x}{1-p_3}$. This is continuous. $g(p_3)=1$, so $g \\in C_{p_3}$. But $g(1)=01$, so $g \\notin C_1$. Therefore, $C_{p_3} \\not\\subseteq C_0 \\cap C_1$. If $p_3 = 1$, consider $g(x)=x$. $g(1)=1 \\ge 1$ so $g \\in C_1$. But $g(0)=0  1$, so $g \\notin C_0$. Thus $C_1 \\not\\subseteq C_0$.\n    The intersection property fails.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{C}$ is not a filter base.\n\n**Analysis of Collection D:**\n$\\mathcal{D} = \\{ D_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$, where $D_n = \\{ f \\in X : f \\text{ has exactly } n \\text{ distinct roots in } (0, 1) \\}$.\n\n1.  **Non-empty collection**: The indexing set $\\mathbb{N}$ is non-empty.\n2.  **Non-empty sets**: For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we must check if $D_n$ is empty. Consider the polynomial $p(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - \\frac{k}{n+1})$. This is a continuous function. Its roots are $\\frac{1}{n+1}, \\frac{2}{n+1}, \\dots, \\frac{n}{n+1}$. These are $n$ distinct points all lying in the interval $(0, 1)$. Thus, $p(x) \\in D_n$, which shows $D_n$ is not empty for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n3.  **Intersection property**: Let's take two distinct sets from the collection, say $D_{n_1}$ and $D_{n_2}$ where $n_1 \\neq n_2$. A function $f$ is in $D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2}$ if it has exactly $n_1$ distinct roots in $(0, 1)$ AND exactly $n_2$ distinct roots in $(0, 1)$. Since $n_1 \\neq n_2$, this is impossible. Therefore, the intersection $D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2} = \\emptyset$.\n    The third property requires that there exists a set $D_{n_3} \\in \\mathcal{D}$ such that $D_{n_3} \\subseteq D_{n_1} \\cap D_{n_2}$. This means $D_{n_3} \\subseteq \\emptyset$, which implies $D_{n_3}$ must be the empty set.\n    However, we have already established in property 2 that no set $D_n$ in the collection $\\mathcal{D}$ is empty. This is a contradiction with the second property of a filter base.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{D}$ is not a filter base.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCollections $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ are filter bases, while collections $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ are not.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1553165"}, {"introduction": "Once we know how to identify a filter base, a natural question arises: how robust is the definition?
