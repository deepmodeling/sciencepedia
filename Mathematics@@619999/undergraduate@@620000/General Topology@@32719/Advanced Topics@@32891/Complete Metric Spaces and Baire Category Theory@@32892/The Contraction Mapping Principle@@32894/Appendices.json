We compute the distance between the images of two points $x$ and $y$ under the function $f$:\n$$d_1(f(x), f(y)) = |f(x) - f(y)|$$\nSubstituting the definition of $f(x)$, we get:\n$$d_1(f(x), f(y)) = \\left|\\frac{x}{5} - \\frac{y}{5}\\right| = \\frac{1}{5}|x - y|$$\nBy the definition of the metric $d_1$, we know that $|x-y| = d_1(x, y)$.

Consider any pair of points $x, y$ such that $|x-y| \\ge 5$. For example, we could choose $x=6, y=0$.\nFor such a pair:\n- The right side of the inequality is $c \\cdot d_2(x, y) = c \\cdot \\min(1, |x-y|)$. Since $|x-y| \\ge 5$, we have $\\min(1, |x-y|) = 1$.
