A metric is defined on this set to quantify the difference between states. This metric, known as the discrete metric $d$, is given by:\n$$\nd(m, n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if } m \\neq n \\\\\n    0 & \\text{if } m = n\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nfor any two states $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe topological properties of this state space, $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$, can be analyzed using the concept of a Polish space. A topological space is defined as a **Polish space** if it is separable and completely metrizable.\n- A metric space is called **separable** if it contains a countable dense subset.

No, because it is neither separable nor complete.\n\nE. No, because a space is only Polish if it is compact, which $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$ is not.", "solution": "To determine if the metric space $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$ is a Polish space, we must check if it meets two conditions: it must be separable and it must be completely metrizable.\n\nFirst, we analyze the separability of $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$.\nA space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset. Let's first understand the topology induced by the discrete metric $d$. The open ball centered at a point $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with radius $r$ is $B(x, r) = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid d(x, y) < r\\}$.\nIf we choose $r \\le 1$, the open ball is $B(x, r) = \\{x\\}$, because the only point $y$ satisfying $d(x, y) < r \\le 1$ is $y=x$ (since $d(x,y)=0 < r$). This means every singleton set $\\{x\\}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is an open set.\nA topology in which every singleton set is open is the discrete topology. In the discrete topology, every subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ is an open set, since any subset is a union of singleton sets.\nNow we consider the closure of a subset $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$. The closure of a set is the smallest closed set containing it. A set is closed if its complement is open. In the discrete topology, since any set $S$ is open, its complement $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$ is also open. This means every set is simultaneously open and closed (clopen).\nTherefore, for any subset $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, $D$ is itself a closed set. The smallest closed set containing $D$ is thus $D$ itself. So, the closure of any $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ is $\\overline{D} = D$.\nFor a subset $D$ to be dense in $\\mathbb{N}$, its closure must be equal to $\\mathbb{N}$. That is, $\\overline{D} = \\mathbb{N}$. Since $\\overline{D} = D$, this implies that the only dense subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ (with the discrete metric) is $\\mathbb{N}$ itself.\nTo be separable, the space must have a countable dense subset. The set $\\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite by definition. Since $\\mathbb{N}$ is a dense subset of itself and is countable, the space $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$ is separable.\n\nSecond, we analyze if the space is completely metrizable.\nA space is completely metrizable if its topology is induced by a complete metric. The topology of our space is induced by the discrete metric $d$. We need to check if this metric $d$ is complete.\nA metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in it converges to a point within the space. Let $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$.\nBy the definition of a Cauchy sequence, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all integers $m, n > N$, we have $d(x_m, x_n) < \\epsilon$.\nLet's choose a specific value for $\\epsilon$, for example, $\\epsilon = 0.5$. According to the definition, there must exist an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, $d(x_m, x_n) < 0.5$.\nFrom the definition of the discrete metric $d$, its values can only be 0 or 1. The condition $d(x_m, x_n) < 0.5$ can only be satisfied if $d(x_m, x_n) = 0$.\nThis means that for all $m, n > N$, we must have $x_m = x_n$. This shows that any Cauchy sequence in the discrete metric must be eventually constant. That is, there exists a state $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and an integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $x_n = x_0$.\nNow we check if this sequence converges. An eventually constant sequence converges to its constant value. To show this formally, let the limit be $L = x_0$. For any $\\epsilon' > 0$, we can choose our integer to be $N$ (the same one from the Cauchy condition). For any $n > N$, we have $x_n = x_0$, so $d(x_n, L) = d(x_0, x_0) = 0 < \\epsilon'$.\nThe sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $x_0$, and since $x_0$ is a term in the sequence drawn from $\\mathbb{N}$, $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nSince every Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$ converges to a point in $\\mathbb{N}$, the metric $d$ is a complete metric.\nBecause the topology of our space is induced by a complete metric, the space is completely metrizable.\n\nSince the space $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$ is both separable and completely metrizable, it is a Polish space by definition. This leads us to option C.\nOption A is incorrect because the space is complete.\nOption B is incorrect because the space is separable.\nOption D is incorrect because the space is both separable and complete.\nOption E introduces an unrelated concept. While many Polish spaces are not compact (like $\\mathbb{R}$), and $(\\mathbb{N}, d)$ is indeed not compact (the open cover by all singletons has no finite subcover), compactness is not a requirement for a space to be Polish.

We are then asked to apply this construction to a specific case.\n\nLet $(X,d)$ be a complete metric space and let $U \\subseteq X$ be a nonempty open subset. The set $C = X \\setminus U$ is a nonempty closed subset of $X$. Since $U$ is nonempty, $C$ is a proper subset of $X$.\n\n**Construction of the metric $\\hat{d}$**\n\nFor any point $x \\in U$, we define the distance from $x$ to the closed set $C$ as:\n$$\nd(x, C) = \\inf_{z \\in C} d(x, z)\n$$\nSince $x \\in U$ and $U$ is open, there exists an open ball $B(x, r) = \\{y \\in X \\mid d(x,y)  r\\}$ for some $r > 0$ such that $B(x, r) \\subseteq U$. This means $B(x, r) \\cap C = \\emptyset$. Consequently, for any $z \\in C$, $d(x,z) \\ge r$. Therefore, $d(x,C) \\ge r > 0$ for all $x \\in U$.\n\nWe define a function $\\phi: U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{d(x, C)}$. This function is well-defined since its denominator is never zero.\nWe now construct the new metric $\\hat{d}$ on $U$ as follows:\n$$\n\\hat{d}(x, y) = d(x, y) + |\\phi(x) - \\phi(y)| = d(x, y) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} \\right|\n$$\nfor all $x, y \\in U$.\n\n**Proof that $\\hat{d}$ is a metric on $U$**\n\nWe must verify the three metric axioms for $\\hat{d}$. For any $x, y, z \\in U$:\n\n1.  **Non-negativity and Identity of Indiscernibles**:\n    $d(x,y) \\ge 0$ and $\\left| \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} \\right| \\ge 0$, so their sum $\\hat{d}(x,y) \\ge 0$.\n    If $x=y$, then $d(x,x)=0$ and $d(x,C)=d(y,C)$, so $\\hat{d}(x,x) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n    Conversely, if $\\hat{d}(x,y) = 0$, then both non-negative terms must be zero. $d(x,y) = 0$ implies $x=y$. Thus, $\\hat{d}(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$.\n\n2.  **Symmetry**:\n    The metric $d$ is symmetric, so $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$. The absolute value is also symmetric, $|\\alpha - \\beta| = |\\beta - \\alpha|$.\n    $$\n    \\hat{d}(x,y) = d(x,y) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} \\right| = d(y,x) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} \\right| = \\hat{d}(y,x)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Triangle Inequality**:\n    We use the triangle inequality for the metric $d$ on $X$ and for the absolute value on $\\mathbb{R}$:\n    $d(x, z) \\le d(x, y) + d(y, z)$.\n    $\\left| \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(z, C)} \\right| = \\left| \\left(\\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(y, C)}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{d(y, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(z, C)}\\right) \\right| \\le \\left| \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} \\right| + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(z, C)} \\right|$.\n    Adding these two inequalities, we get:\n    $$\n    d(x, z) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(z, C)} \\right| \\le \\left( d(x, y) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} \\right| \\right) + \\left( d(y, z) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(y, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(z, C)} \\right| \\right)\n    $$\n    which is precisely $\\hat{d}(x, z) \\le \\hat{d}(x, y) + \\hat{d}(y, z)$.\n    Thus, $\\hat{d}$ is a metric on $U$.\n\n**Proof of Topological Equivalence**\n\nThe topology induced by $\\hat{d}$ is the same as the subspace topology on $U$ (induced by $d$) if and only if a sequence $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\subseteq U$ converges to a point $x \\in U$ with respect to $d$ if and only if it converges to $x$ with respect to $\\hat{d}$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the continuity of the function $x \\mapsto d(x, C)$. For any $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ and any $z \\in C$, we have $d(x_1, z) \\le d(x_1, x_2) + d(x_2, z)$. Taking the infimum over all $z \\in C$ on the right side yields $d(x_1, C) \\le d(x_1, x_2) + d(x_2, C)$. This gives $d(x_1, C) - d(x_2, C) \\le d(x_1, x_2)$. By symmetry, $d(x_2, C) - d(x_1, C) \\le d(x_2, x_1) = d(x_1, x_2)$. Combining these gives $|d(x_1, C) - d(x_2, C)| \\le d(x_1, x_2)$. This shows that $x \\mapsto d(x, C)$ is Lipschitz continuous on $X$, and therefore on $U$.\n\n$(\\Rightarrow)$ Assume $x_n \\to x$ in $(U, d)$, i.e., $d(x_n, x) \\to 0$. We need to show $\\hat{d}(x_n, x) \\to 0$.\n$$\n\\hat{d}(x_n, x) = d(x_n, x) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(x_n, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} \\right|\n$$\nThe first term $d(x_n, x) \\to 0$ by assumption. For the second term, since $x \\mapsto d(x,C)$ is continuous, $d(x_n, x) \\to 0$ implies $d(x_n, C) \\to d(x, C)$. As $x \\in U$, we have $d(x, C) > 0$. The function $t \\mapsto 1/t$ is continuous for $t > 0$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{d(x_n, C)} \\to \\frac{1}{d(x, C)}$. This implies $\\left| \\frac{1}{d(x_n, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(x, C)} \\right| \\to 0$. So, $\\hat{d}(x_n, x) \\to 0$.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Assume $x_n \\to x$ in $(U, \\hat{d})$, i.e., $\\hat{d}(x_n, x) \\to 0$. From the definition $\\hat{d}(x_n, x) = d(x_n, x) + \\left| \\dots \\right|$, and since both terms are non-negative, we must have $d(x_n, x) \\to 0$.\n\nThis establishes that the two metrics induce the same topology on $U$.\n\n**Proof of Completeness of $(U, \\hat{d})$**\n\nLet $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $(U, \\hat{d})$. This means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n, m > N$, $\\hat{d}(x_n, x_m)  \\epsilon$.\n$$\nd(x_n, x_m) + \\left| \\frac{1}{d(x_n, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(x_m, C)} \\right|  \\epsilon\n$$\nThis implies two things:\n1.  $d(x_n, x_m)  \\epsilon$. Thus, $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(X, d)$.\n2.  $\\left| \\frac{1}{d(x_n, C)} - \\frac{1}{d(x_m, C)} \\right|  \\epsilon$. Thus, the sequence of real numbers $(\\phi(x_n))_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{d(x_n, C)}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $(X, d)$ is complete, the Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$ converges to some limit $x \\in X$. That is, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d(x_n, x) = 0$. We must show that $x \\in U$.\n\nSince $(\\phi(x_n))$ is a Cauchy sequence in the complete space $\\mathbb{R}$, it converges to some limit $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A convergent sequence is bounded, so there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $|\\phi(x_n)| \\le M$ for all $n$. This means $\\frac{1}{d(x_n, C)} \\le M$, which implies $d(x_n, C) \\ge \\frac{1}{M} > 0$ for all $n$.\n\nNow we use the continuity of the function $g(y) = d(y, C)$. Since $x_n \\to x$ in $(X,d)$, we have $d(x_n, C) \\to d(x, C)$. Taking the limit of the inequality $d(x_n, C) \\ge \\frac{1}{M}$, we get:\n$$\nd(x, C) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d(x_n, C) \\ge \\frac{1}{M} > 0\n$$\nSince $d(x, C) > 0$, the point $x$ cannot be in the closure of $C$. As $C$ is a closed set, its closure is itself. So $x \\notin C$, which means $x \\in X \\setminus C = U$.\n\nWe have shown that any Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$ in $(U, \\hat{d})$ converges in the metric $d$ to a limit $x$ that is also in $U$. Since we have already proven that the topologies induced by $d$ and $\\hat{d}$ are equivalent on $U$, convergence in $d$ to a point in $U$ is equivalent to convergence in $\\hat{d}$ to that same point. Therefore, $x_n \\to x$ in $(U, \\hat{d})$.\nThis proves that $(U, \\hat{d})$ is a complete metric space.\n\n**Specialization and Calculation**\n\nWe are given $X=\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual Euclidean metric $d(x,y)=|x-y|$, and $U=(0,1)$.

We will analyze the properties of $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$—separability, completeness, and whether it qualifies as a Polish space—by examining each of the given options.\n\nFirst, let's establish the properties of the ambient space $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$. The space $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^4$ via the mapping $ \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (a, b, c, d) $. The given metric $d$ is the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^4$. It is a standard result that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the Euclidean metric is a complete and separable metric space.

A matrix $A \\in M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ if and only if its determinant is non-zero. The determinant function, $\\det: M_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathbb{R}$, is given by $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix} = ad - bc$. This is a polynomial function of the matrix entries. As a polynomial, the determinant function is continuous.\n\nThe set $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ can be expressed as the preimage of the set $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ under the determinant map: $GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\det^{-1}(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})$. Since $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ and the determinant function is continuous, its preimage $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ must be an open subset of $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nWith these foundational facts, let's evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A: $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is not separable and therefore is not a Polish space.**\nA metric space is separable if it has a countable dense subset. A fundamental theorem in topology states that any subspace of a separable metric space is separable. Since $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is separable (e.g., the set of matrices with rational entries is a countable dense subset), its subspace $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is also separable. Thus, statement A is false.\n\n**Option D: $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a closed subset of $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and is therefore a Polish space.**\nAs shown earlier, $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is an open subset of $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$. Is it closed? A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is the set of singular matrices, $\\{ A \\in M_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = 0 \\}$. This can be written as $\\det^{-1}(\\{0\\})$. Since $\\{0\\}$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\det$ is continuous, the set of singular matrices is a closed set. This confirms that its complement, $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, is indeed open. A proper, non-empty open subset of a connected space (like $M_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^4$) cannot be closed. Since the zero matrix is singular, $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a proper subset, so it is not closed. Thus, statement D is false.\n\n**Option E: $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a compact space and therefore a Polish space.**\nIn a Euclidean space like $M_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^4$, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. We have already established that $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is not closed. Furthermore, it is not bounded. For example, consider the sequence of matrices $A_n = nI = \\begin{pmatrix} n  0 \\\\ 0  n \\end{pmatrix}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Each $A_n$ is in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ since $\\det(A_n) = n^2 \\neq 0$. However, the norm $d(A_n, 0) = \\sqrt{n^2 + n^2} = n\\sqrt{2}$ is unbounded. Thus, $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is not compact. Statement E is false.\n\n**Option B: $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is separable, but since it is not a complete metric space under the inherited metric $d$, it is not a Polish space.**\nWe already know $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is separable. Now let's check its completeness under the metric $d$. A subspace of a complete metric space is complete if and only if it is a closed subspace. Since $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is not a closed subset of the complete space $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$, the metric space $(GL(2, \\mathbb{R}), d)$ is not complete. To see this explicitly, consider the sequence $A_n = \\frac{1}{n}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/n  0 \\\\ 0  1/n \\end{pmatrix}$. Each $A_n \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ as $\\det(A_n) = 1/n^2 \\neq 0$. This sequence is a Cauchy sequence, and it converges in $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ to the zero matrix $O$. However, $\\det(O)=0$, so the limit point $O$ is not in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. A Cauchy sequence that does not converge to a point within the space proves the space is not complete.\nSo, the premise of statement B is correct. However, the conclusion is flawed. The definition of a Polish space requires *complete metrizability*, not completeness with a specific metric. A space is completely metrizable if *there exists* a complete metric that induces the same topology. According to a major theorem in topology (a consequence of Alexandroff's theorem), any open subset of a Polish space is itself a Polish space. Since $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is a Polish space and $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is an open subset, $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a Polish space. Therefore, the conclusion in B is false, making the entire statement false.\n\n**Option C: $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is not a closed subset of $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$, but it is a Polish space.**\nThis statement claims two things. First, $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is not a closed subset of $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$. As we showed in the analysis of option D, this is true. Second, it claims $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a Polish space. As justified in the analysis of option B, being an open subset of the Polish space $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$, $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is indeed a Polish space. Both parts of the statement are correct.\n\nTherefore, statement C is the only correct description of $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1568442"}]}
