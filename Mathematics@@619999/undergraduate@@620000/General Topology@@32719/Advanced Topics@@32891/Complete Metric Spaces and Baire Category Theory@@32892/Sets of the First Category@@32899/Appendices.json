II and IV only", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of the four listed topological properties are always true for the set of real roots, $Z_P$, of any non-zero polynomial $P(x)$ with real coefficients.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the nature of the set $Z_P$. A fundamental result from algebra states that a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ distinct roots. Since any non-zero polynomial $P(x)$ has a finite degree, the set of its real roots, $Z_P$, must be a finite set. Let $Z_P = \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_k\\}$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer (if there are no real roots, $k=0$ and $Z_P$ is the empty set).\n\nNow we evaluate each property for a general finite subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Property I: The set is closed.**\nA set is closed if its complement is open. Let $Z_P = \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_k\\}$ be a finite set of points in $\\mathbb{R}$. The complement of $Z_P$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus Z_P$. This complement can be written as a union of a finite number of open intervals and/or open rays. For example, if we order the roots $r_1 < r_2 < \\dots < r_k$, then $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus Z_P = (-\\infty, r_1) \\cup (r_1, r_2) \\cup \\dots \\cup (r_k, \\infty)$. Since the finite union of open sets is always open, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus Z_P$ is an open set. Therefore, by definition, its complement $Z_P$ must be a closed set. The empty set is also closed. Thus, property I is always true.\n\n**Property II: The interior of the set is empty.**\nThe interior of a set $A$, denoted $\\text{int}(A)$, is the largest open set contained within $A$. For $\\text{int}(Z_P)$ to be non-empty, $Z_P$ would have to contain an open interval $(a, b)$ with $a < b$. However, any such open interval contains uncountably many points. Since $Z_P$ is a finite set, it cannot contain any open interval. Therefore, the largest open set contained in $Z_P$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. So, $\\text{int}(Z_P) = \\emptyset$. Property II is always true.\n\n**Property III: The set is nowhere dense.**\nA set $A$ is defined as nowhere dense if the interior of its closure, $\\text{int}(\\bar{A})$, is empty.\nFrom our analysis of Property I, we know that $Z_P$ is a closed set. The closure of a closed set is the set itself. Thus, the closure of $Z_P$ is $\\overline{Z_P} = Z_P$.\nWe are interested in the interior of this closure, which is $\\text{int}(\\overline{Z_P}) = \\text{int}(Z_P)$.\nFrom our analysis of Property II, we know that $\\text{int}(Z_P) = \\emptyset$.\nTherefore, $\\text{int}(\\overline{Z_P}) = \\emptyset$. This satisfies the definition of a nowhere dense set. Thus, property III is always true.\n\n**Property IV: The set is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.**\nA set $A$ is defined as dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ if its closure is equal to $\\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $\\bar{A} = \\mathbb{R}$.\nAs established for Property III, the closure of $Z_P$ is $Z_P$ itself, because $Z_P$ is a finite (and thus closed) set. So, $\\overline{Z_P} = Z_P$.\nFor $Z_P$ to be dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we would need $Z_P = \\mathbb{R}$. This is impossible, as $Z_P$ is a finite set and $\\mathbb{R}$ is an infinite (in fact, uncountable) set. Therefore, $Z_P$ is not dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. Property IV is false.\n\nIn summary:\n- Property I (Closed) is always true.\n- Property II (Empty interior) is always true.\n- Property III (Nowhere dense) is always true.\n- Property IV (Dense in $\\mathbb{R}$) is always false.\n\nThe properties that $Z_P$ must necessarily possess are I, II, and III.

This exercise demonstrates the construction of the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, as a countable union of finite (and thus nowhere dense) sets, thereby showing it is a set of the first category.

By definition, every element of each set $S_k$ is a rational number. Therefore, their union, $S$, must be a set of rational numbers.\n\nNext, we show that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq S$. Let $r$ be an arbitrary rational number. We can write $r$ in its unique lowest-terms representation as $p/q$, where $p$ is an integer, $q$ is a positive integer, and $\\gcd(|p|, q) = 1$. The number $k = |p| + q$ is a positive integer. By definition of the set $S_k$, the rational number $r = p/q$ is an element of $S_k$. Since $S = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} S_j$, it follows that $r \\in S$. Because $r$ was an arbitrary rational number, we can conclude that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq S$.\n\nCombining the two inclusions, we have established that $S = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the topological properties of S = Q**\n\nNow we must evaluate the properties of the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, as a subset of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology.\n\n*   **Countability**: The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a classic example of a countably infinite set. This can be shown by creating a bijective mapping from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$. Alternatively, in our specific construction, $S$ is a countable union of sets $S_k$. For any given $k$, the number of pairs $(p, q)$ such that $|p| + q = k$ is finite. For example, for $k=4$, we have $(|p|,q)$ pairs (3,1), (2,2), (1,3). The corresponding lowest-term rationals are $\\pm 3/1, \\pm 1/3$. So each $S_k$ is a finite set. A countable union of finite sets is a countable set. Thus, $S = \\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.\n\n*   **Density**: The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any two distinct real numbers $a$ and $b$, there exists a rational number $r$ such that $a < r < b$. An equivalent statement is that every non-empty open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ contains at least one rational number. A consequence of this is that the closure of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **Other Properties**: $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not all of $\\mathbb{R}$, as irrational numbers like $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\pi$, and $e$ exist. This means $\\mathbb{Q} \\neq \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the multiple-choice options**\n\nNow we use the properties of $S = \\mathbb{Q}$ to check each statement.\n\n*   **A. $S$ is a closed and bounded set.** This is false.\n    *   $S$ is not bounded because for any real number $M > 0$, we can find a rational number $r > M$ (for instance, the integer $\\lfloor M \\rfloor + 1$).\n    *   $S$ is not closed. A set is closed if it contains all of its limit points. Consider the sequence of rational numbers $x_n = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac{1}{i!}$. This sequence converges to the irrational number $e$. Since all $x_n$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}$ but their limit $e$ is not, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a closed set.\n\n*   **B. $S$ contains a non-empty open interval.** This is false. Any non-empty open interval $(a, b)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ contains not only rational numbers but also irrational numbers (since the irrationals are also dense in $\\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, no open interval can be a subset of $S = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **C. The complement of $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, denoted $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus S$, is a countable set.** This is false. The complement of $S = \\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of irrational numbers, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$. This set is known to be uncountable.\n\n*   **D. $S$ is a countable set and is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.** This is true. As established in Step 2, $S = \\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set, and it is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **E. $S$ is an uncountable set and is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.** This is false.
