By investigating whether $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Baire space, you will gain direct experience with the definitions of nowhere dense and meager sets and see how a space that is \"large\" in a cardinality sense (infinite) can be considered \"small\" in a topological sense [@problem_id:1575325].", "problem": "In the study of topological spaces, we often classify spaces based on their \"size\" not in terms of cardinality, but in terms of category. This problem explores these concepts within the familiar context of the rational numbers.\n\nConsider the set of all rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, equipped with the standard metric inherited from the real numbers, $d(x, y) = |x - y|$. Let us define the following terms for a general metric space $(X, d)$:\n\n- A set $A \\subseteq X$ is called **nowhere dense** in $X$ if the interior of its closure is the empty set.\n- A set $S \\subseteq X$ is called **meager** (or of the first category) in $X$ if it can be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n- A topological space $X$ is called a **Baire space** if it is not meager in itself. That is, $X$ cannot be expressed as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n\nBased on these definitions, determine whether the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is a Baire space and select the option that provides the correct conclusion and justification.\n\nA. No, because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and can be expressed as a countable union of its singleton points, each of which is a nowhere dense set in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nB. Yes, because the Baire Category Theorem states that any complete metric space is a Baire space, and $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a complete metric space.\n\nC. Yes, because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a dense subset of the Baire space $\\mathbb{R}$, and any dense subset of a Baire space is also a Baire space.\n\nD. No, because every proper non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is nowhere dense.\n\nE. Yes, because no non-empty open set in $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be meager, which is the definition of a Baire space.", "solution": "To determine if the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is a Baire space, we must check if it is meager in itself, according to the provided definition. A space is meager in itself if it can be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n\nStep 1: Express $\\mathbb{Q}$ as a countable union of sets.\nThe set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is known to be a countable set. This means we can enumerate all of its elements in a sequence, say $q_1, q_2, q_3, \\dots$. Therefore, we can express the entire set $\\mathbb{Q}$ as the union of all its individual points (singleton sets):\n$$ \\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n\\} $$\nThis is a countable union of sets. Now we need to determine if each of these sets, $\\{q_n\\}$, is nowhere dense in the space $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nStep 2: Analyze whether a singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$ is nowhere dense in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nAccording to the definition, a set $A$ is nowhere dense if the interior of its closure is empty, i.e., $\\text{int}(\\bar{A}) = \\emptyset$. Let's apply this to the set $A_n = \\{q_n\\}$.\n\nFirst, we find the closure of $\\{q_n\\}$ in the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$. In any metric space, a finite set of points is a closed set. Thus, the closure of a singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$ is the set itself:\n$$ \\overline{\\{q_n\\}} = \\{q_n\\} $$\n\nNext, we find the interior of this closure. The interior of a set $S$ consists of all points $p \\in S$ for which there exists an open ball centered at $p$ that is entirely contained within $S$. Here, we need to find the interior of $\\{q_n\\}$. Let's consider the only point in this set, $q_n$. For $q_n$ to be an interior point, there must exist some $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $B(q_n, \\epsilon)$ is a subset of $\\{q_n\\}$.\n\nThe open ball in the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is defined as:\n$$ B(q_n, \\epsilon) = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid |q_n - q|  \\epsilon \\} $$\nIt is a fundamental property of the rational numbers that between any two distinct rational numbers, there exists another rational number. This implies that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, the open ball $B(q_n, \\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers other than $q_n$. Therefore, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, $B(q_n, \\epsilon)$ is not a subset of the singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$.\n\nSince there is no open ball centered at $q_n$ that is contained in $\\{q_n\\}$, the point $q_n$ is not an interior point of $\\{q_n\\}$. As $q_n$ is the only point in the set, the interior of $\\{q_n\\}$ is empty:\n$$ \\text{int}(\\{q_n\\}) = \\emptyset $$\n\nCombining these findings, the interior of the closure of $\\{q_n\\}$ is:\n$$ \\text{int}(\\overline{\\{q_n\\}}) = \\text{int}(\\{q_n\\}) = \\emptyset $$\nBy definition, this means that each singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$ is a nowhere dense set in the space $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Baire space.\nWe have shown that $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be written as a countable union of sets $\\{q_n\\}$, and that each of these sets is nowhere dense in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n\\} \\quad \\text{where each } \\{q_n\\} \\text{ is nowhere dense in } \\mathbb{Q}. $$\nThis is precisely the definition of a meager set. Therefore, the space $\\mathbb{Q}$ is meager in itself.\n\nBy definition, a Baire space is a space that is *not* meager in itself. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is meager in itself, it is **not** a Baire space.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. No, because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and can be expressed as a countable union of its singleton points, each of which is a nowhere dense set in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This matches our derivation perfectly.\n- B. This is incorrect. The Baire Category Theorem does state that a complete metric space is a Baire space, but the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is famously *not* complete. For instance, a sequence of rational numbers converging to an irrational number like $\\sqrt{2}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$ that does not have a limit in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- C. This is incorrect. While $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Baire space (as it is complete), the property of being a Baire space is not necessarily inherited by all dense subsets.\n- D. This is incorrect. The statement that every proper non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is nowhere dense is false. For example, the open interval $(0, 1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its closure in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[0, 1] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$, and the interior of this closure is $(0, 1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$, which is not empty.\n- E. This is incorrect. It presents a consequence of being a Baire space as a reason. A space is a Baire space if and only if every non-empty open subset is of the second category (i.e. not meager). Option E states this as a justification for $\\mathbb{Q}$ being a Baire space, but we have proven that $\\mathbb{Q}$ itself is meager, invalidating the premise.\n\nThus, the only correct conclusion and justification is provided by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1575325"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a space that is meager in itself, we now turn our attention to identifying meager subsets within a larger, more robust space.

A set is nowhere dense if the interior of its closure is empty.\n\nStep 1: Show that each line is a closed set.\nEach line $L_m$ is the set of points where the continuous function $f_m(x,y) = y - mx$ is zero. The inverse image of a closed set (the point $\\{0\\}$) under a continuous map is closed. Thus, each $L_m$ is closed. Similarly, $L_\\infty$ is the zero set of the continuous function $g(x,y) = x$, so it is also closed. Since each line is closed, its closure is the line itself.\n\nStep 2: Show that each line has an empty interior.\nLet $L$ be any line in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For any point $p \\in L$, any open ball $B_r(p)$ centered at $p$ is a two-dimensional disk. This disk cannot be entirely contained within the one-dimensional line $L$. Therefore, the interior of $L$ is empty.\n\nStep 3: Conclude that each line is nowhere dense.\nSince each line $L$ is closed and has an empty interior, the interior of its closure is empty ($\\text{int}(\\bar{L}) = \\text{int}(L) = \\emptyset$). By definition, each line is a nowhere dense set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nStep 4: Conclude that S is of the first category.\nThe set $S$ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets.
