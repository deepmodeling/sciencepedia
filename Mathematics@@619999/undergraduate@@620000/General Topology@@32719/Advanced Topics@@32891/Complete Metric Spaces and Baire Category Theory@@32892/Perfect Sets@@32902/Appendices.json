One such property is that of being a 'perfect set'. A set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is called a perfect set if it is identical to its set of limit points (also known as the derived set, $S'$). A point $x$ is a limit point of a set $S$ if every open interval containing $x$ also contains at least one point of $S$ different from $x$.
