By examining the familiar space $[0,1]$, we will see how topological properties can be inherited, providing an efficient way to classify new spaces based on old ones.", "problem": "In general topology, a topological space $X$ is called a **regular space** if for any closed set $C \\subseteq X$ and any point $p \\in X$ such that $p \\notin C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p \\in U$ and $C \\subseteq V$.\n\nIt is a known theorem that the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, equipped with its standard (Euclidean) topology, is a regular space. The closed interval $[0,1]$ can be considered a topological space by endowing it with the subspace topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and correct justification for the fact that the closed interval $[0,1]$, with its subspace topology, is a regular space?\n\nA. Regularity is a hereditary property, meaning every subspace of a regular space is regular.\nB. Every compact space is regular, and $[0,1]$ is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem.\nC. The Urysohn Metrization Theorem states that every regular, second-countable Hausdorff space is metrizable. Since $[0,1]$ is metrizable, it must be regular.\nD. Normality is a hereditary property, meaning every subspace of a normal space is normal. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is normal, $[0,1]$ is normal, and every normal space is regular.", "solution": "We recall the definition: a space $X$ is regular if for every closed set $C \\subseteq X$ and every point $p \\in X \\setminus C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U,V \\subseteq X$ with $p \\in U$ and $C \\subseteq V$.\n\nThe most direct justification is that regularity is a hereditary property. Let $X$ be a regular space and let $Y \\subseteq X$ carry the subspace topology. To show that $Y$ is regular, fix any closed set $C \\subseteq Y$ and any point $y \\in Y \\setminus C$. By definition of the subspace topology, there exists a closed set $D \\subseteq X$ such that $C = Y \\cap D$. Since $y \\in Y$ and $y \\notin C = Y \\cap D$, it follows that $y \\notin D$.\n\nBecause $X$ is regular and $D$ is a closed set in $X$ with $y \\notin D$, there exist disjoint open sets $U,V \\subseteq X$ such that $y \\in U$ and $D \\subseteq V$. Now, define $U' = U \\cap Y$ and $V' = V \\cap Y$. By the definition of the subspace topology, $U'$ and $V'$ are open in $Y$. We have $y \\in U'$, and\n$$\nC = Y \\cap D \\subseteq Y \\cap V = V'.\n$$\nMoreover, $U'$ and $V'$ are disjoint because $U \\cap V = \\varnothing$ implies $(U \\cap Y) \\cap (V \\cap Y) = \\varnothing$. Therefore, $Y$ is regular.\n\nApplying this general result with $X = \\mathbb{R}$ (which is known to be regular) and $Y = [0,1] \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$, we conclude that $[0,1]$ is regular. This makes option A the correct and most direct justification.\n\nFor completeness regarding the other options:\n- Option B is false. While compact Hausdorff spaces are regular, compactness alone does not imply regularity.\n- Option C presents a valid but circular justification. The Urysohn Metrization Theorem states `Metrizable => (Regular  Hausdorff  Second-Countable)`, which implies that since $[0,1]$ is metrizable, it must be regular. However, this is not the most direct argument. Regularity is a more fundamental property that is often proven as a step *towards* establishing metrizability.\n- Option D is incorrect because its premise is false: normality is not a hereditary property for arbitrary subspaces.

There are two cases.\n- If there exists $\\gamma$ with $\\alpha\\gamma\\beta$ (e.g., if $\\beta$ is not the successor of $\\alpha$), then we can choose such a $\\gamma$.

Thus, they are disjoint open sets separating $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nIn all cases, any two distinct points can be separated, so $X$ is Hausdorff.\n\nStep 2: $X$ is regular. This is a standard fact for all linearly ordered topological spaces (LOTS): every LOTS with the order topology is regular. More concretely, for any point $p$ and an open neighborhood $O$ of $p$, there exists a basic open interval $I$ (like $(a,b)$ or $[0,b)$) such that $p \\in I \\subseteq O$. One can then find a smaller open interval $J$ whose closure is contained in $I$. This \"shrinking lemma\" for basic neighborhoods establishes that the space is regular. Therefore, $X$ is regular.\n\nStep 3: $X$ is not second-countable. We can show this by demonstrating that $X$ is not Lindelöf. A space is Lindelöf if every open cover has a countable subcover.
