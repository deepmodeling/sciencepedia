The distance between centers of distinct balls is at least $1$, while the sum of radii of any two balls is $1/2$. Hence the balls are pairwise disjoint and separated by a positive distance. Given any $p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, if $p$ lies in some $B((n,0),1/4)$, choose $V$ so small that $V\\subset B((n,0),1/4)$; then $V$ meets exactly one member. If $p$ lies outside all balls, choose $V$ small enough to avoid them all; then $V$ meets none, which is at most one. Therefore $\\mathcal{F}_{A}$ is a discrete family, hence (in particular) locally finite. Thus A is not an example of “locally finite but not discrete.”\n\nOption B: $\\mathcal{F}_{B}=\\{B((m,n),3/4)\\mid m,n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. We first show local finiteness. Fix $p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and choose any open ball $U=B(p,r)$ with $r>0$. If $U\\cap B((m,n),3/4)\\neq\\emptyset$, then the center $(m,n)$ lies in $B(p,r+3/4)$. The set of integer lattice points in the bounded ball $B(p,r+3/4)$ is finite, hence only finitely many members of $\\mathcal{F}_{B}$ meet $U$. Therefore, for each $p$, such a $U$ exists and $\\mathcal{F}_{B}$ is locally finite. We now show it is not discrete. Consider $p=(1/2,1/2)$.

Consequently, every open neighborhood of $p$ intersects at least these four members, so no neighborhood of $p$ can intersect at most one member. Hence $\\mathcal{F}_{B}$ is not a discrete family. Therefore B is an example of a family that is locally finite but not discrete.\n\nOption C: $\\mathcal{F}_{C}=\\{B((1/n,1/n),1/n)\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}, n\\geq 2\\}$. Let $p=(0,0)$. The distance from $p$ to the center $(1/n,1/n)$ is $\\sqrt{2}/n$, so the distance from $p$ to the ball $B((1/n,1/n),1/n)$ is $(\\sqrt{2}-1)/n$. For any $r>0$, choose $N$ such that for all $n\\geq N$, $(\\sqrt{2}-1)/n<r$. Then $B(p,r)$ intersects $B((1/n,1/n),1/n)$ for all $n\\geq N$, hence $B(p,r)$ meets infinitely many members of $\\mathcal{F}_{C}$.

Therefore C cannot be the desired example.\n\nOption D: $\\mathcal{F}_{D}=\\{(n-1/3,n+1/3)\\times\\mathbb{R}\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. These vertical strips are pairwise disjoint and separated by open gaps of width $1/3$ on the $x$-axis. For any $p=(x,y)$, if $x\\in(n-1/3,n+1/3)$ for some $n$, choose a ball $V$ centered at $p$ with radius smaller than $\\min\\{x-(n-1/3),(n+1/3)-x\\}$; then $V\\subset (n-1/3,n+1/3)\\times\\mathbb{R}$ and meets exactly one strip. If $x$ lies in a gap $(n+1/3,n+2/3)$, choose $V$ of radius less than the distance to the nearest strip boundary, and $V$ meets none.
