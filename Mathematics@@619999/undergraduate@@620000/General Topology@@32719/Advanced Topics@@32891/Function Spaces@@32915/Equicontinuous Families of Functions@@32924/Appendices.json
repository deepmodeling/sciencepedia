This $\\delta$ depends only on $\\epsilon$, not on any particular point or function in the family.\n\nNow, let $x_0$ be an arbitrary point in $K$. Let $x$ be any point in $K$ such that $d(x, x_0) < \\delta$. We need to show that $|S(x) - S(x_0)| < \\epsilon$. We will do this by showing that $S(x) - S(x_0) < \\epsilon$ and $S(x_0) - S(x) < \\epsilon$.\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for $S(x) - S(x_0)$. For any function $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$, because $d(x, x_0) < \\delta$, the equicontinuity condition gives us $g(x) - g(x_0) < \\epsilon/2$, or $g(x) < g(x_0) + \\epsilon/2$. By the definition of $S(x_0)$, we know that $g(x_0) \\le S(x_0)$. Therefore, for any $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$, we have $g(x) < S(x_0) + \\epsilon/2$. Since this inequality holds for all functions in the family $\\mathcal{G}$, it must also hold for their supremum. Thus, we can take the supremum of the left side over all $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$ to get $S(x) = \\sup_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} g(x) \\le S(x_0) + \\epsilon/2$. This implies $S(x) - S(x_0) \\le \\epsilon/2 < \\epsilon$.\n\nNext, let's establish a lower bound for $S(x) - S(x_0)$. By the definition of $S(x_0)$ as a supremum, for our given $\\epsilon > 0$, there must exist a function $g_0 \\in \\mathcal{G}$ (which may depend on $x_0$ and $\\epsilon$) such that $S(x_0) - \\epsilon/2 < g_0(x_0)$. For this specific function $g_0$ and for $x$ satisfying $d(x, x_0) < \\delta$, the equicontinuity condition implies $|g_0(x) - g_0(x_0)| < \\epsilon/2$, which means $g_0(x_0) - g_0(x) < \\epsilon/2$, or $g_0(x_0) < g_0(x) + \\epsilon/2$. Combining our two inequalities involving $g_0(x_0)$, we have $S(x_0) - \\epsilon/2 < g_0(x_0) < g_0(x) + \\epsilon/2$. This simplifies to $S(x_0) - \\epsilon/2 < g_0(x) + \\epsilon/2$, which gives $S(x_0) < g_0(x) + \\epsilon$. Now, by the definition of $S(x)$, we know that $g_0(x) \\le S(x)$. Substituting this into our last inequality, we get $S(x_0) < S(x) + \\epsilon$, which implies $S(x_0) - S(x) < \\epsilon$.\n\nCombining the two results, we have shown that if $d(x, x_0) < \\delta$, then $S(x) - S(x_0) \\le \\epsilon/2 < \\epsilon$ and $S(x_0) - S(x) < \\epsilon$. Together, these imply $|S(x) - S(x_0)| < \\epsilon$. Since our choice of $x_0$ was arbitrary, this proves that $S(x)$ is continuous on $K$. In fact, since $\\delta$ did not depend on $x_0$, we have shown that $S(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $K$.\n\nTherefore, statement A is necessarily true.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other options.\nB is false because we have proven that $S(x)$ is continuous. Also, the supremum of a family of continuous functions is, in general, lower semi-continuous, not upper semi-continuous.\nC is false. While the \"if\" part is true (the maximum of a finite number of continuous functions is continuous), the \"only if\" part is false. Our proof shows continuity holds for infinite equicontinuous families as well.\nD is false. The proof does not rely on the connectedness of $K$ in any way.
