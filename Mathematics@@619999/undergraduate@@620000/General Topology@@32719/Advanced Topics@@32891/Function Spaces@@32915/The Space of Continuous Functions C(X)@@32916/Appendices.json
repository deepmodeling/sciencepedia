The zero vector in the space $C(\\mathbb{R})$ is the zero function, $z(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To determine if $z(x)$ is in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$, we must find its support. The set of points where $z(x)$ is non-zero is the empty set, $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid z(x) \\neq 0\\} = \\emptyset$. The support is the closure of this set, $\\text{supp}(z) = \\overline{\\emptyset} = \\emptyset$. The empty set is a compact set in $\\mathbb{R}$ because it is both closed and bounded (vacuously). Since the support of the zero function is compact, the zero function $z(x)$ is in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nNext, let's check for closure under addition. Let $f$ and $g$ be two arbitrary functions in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$. This means that their supports, $\\text{supp}(f)$ and $\\text{supp}(g)$, are compact sets. Let $h = f+g$. We need to determine if the support of $h$ is compact.\nA point $x$ can be in the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid h(x) \\neq 0\\}$ only if at least one of $f(x)$ or $g(x)$ is non-zero. If both $f(x)=0$ and $g(x)=0$, then $(f+g)(x)=0$. This gives the inclusion:\n$$ \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (f+g)(x) \\neq 0\\} \\subseteq \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\} \\cup \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid g(x) \\neq 0\\} $$\nTaking the closure of both sides and using the property that $\\overline{A \\cup B} = \\overline{A} \\cup \\overline{B}$, we get:\n$$ \\text{supp}(f+g) = \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (f+g)(x) \\neq 0\\}} \\subseteq \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\} \\cup \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid g(x) \\neq 0\\}} $$\n$$ \\text{supp}(f+g) \\subseteq \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\}} \\cup \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid g(x) \\neq 0\\}} $$\n$$ \\text{supp}(f+g) \\subseteq \\text{supp}(f) \\cup \\text{supp}(g) $$\nBy assumption, $\\text{supp}(f)$ and $\\text{supp}(g)$ are compact sets. The finite union of compact sets is also a compact set. Thus, $\\text{supp}(f) \\cup \\text{supp}(g)$ is compact. The support of a function, being a closure, is always a closed set. Since $\\text{supp}(f+g)$ is a closed subset of the compact set $\\text{supp}(f) \\cup \\text{supp}(g)$, it must also be compact. Therefore, $f+g \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$, and $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ is closed under addition. This shows that statement B is incorrect.\n\nFinally, let's check for closure under scalar multiplication. Let $f \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ and let $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be a scalar.\nCase 1: $c=0$. Then $c \\cdot f$ is the zero function, $z(x)=0$. As we showed earlier, the zero function is in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$.\nCase 2: $c \\neq 0$. The product $(c \\cdot f)(x) = c \\cdot f(x)$ is non-zero if and only if $f(x)$ is non-zero. Thus, the set of points where $c \\cdot f$ is non-zero is identical to the set where $f$ is non-zero:\n$$ \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (c \\cdot f)(x) \\neq 0\\} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\} $$\nTaking the closure of both sides, we find that the supports are equal:\n$$ \\text{supp}(c \\cdot f) = \\text{supp}(f) $$\nSince $f \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$, its support is compact. Therefore, $\\text{supp}(c \\cdot f)$ is also compact, which means $c \\cdot f \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$.\nCombining both cases, we see that $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ is closed under scalar multiplication. Thus, statement C is incorrect.\n\nSince $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ contains the zero vector and is closed under both addition and scalar multiplication, it satisfies all the requirements to be a vector subspace of $C(\\mathbb{R})$.

Let this point be $x_0 \\in X$ such that $f(x_0) \\neq g(x_0)$.\n\nLet $y_1 = f(x_0)$ and $y_2 = g(x_0)$.

Disjoint means that their intersection is empty: $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe functions $f: X \\to Y$ and $g: X \\to Y$ are given to be continuous. By the definition of continuity, the preimage of any open set in the codomain is an open set in the domain.\nSince $U_1$ is an open set in $Y$, its preimage under $f$, denoted $f^{-1}(U_1)$, is an open set in $X$.\nSimilarly, since $U_2$ is an open set in $Y$, its preimage under $g$, denoted $g^{-1}(U_2)$, is an open set in $X$.\n\nLet's define a set $V$ as the intersection of these two preimages: $V = f^{-1}(U_1) \\cap g^{-1}(U_2)$. Since the intersection of two open sets is an open set, $V$ is an open set in $X$.\n\nNow, let's check if $x_0$ is in $V$.\nWe know $f(x_0) = y_1 \\in U_1$, which by definition of a preimage means $x_0 \\in f^{-1}(U_1)$.\nWe also know $g(x_0) = y_2 \\in U_2$, which means $x_0 \\in g^{-1}(U_2)$.\nSince $x_0$ is in both sets, it must be in their intersection: $x_0 \\in V$.\nThis confirms that $V$ is a non-empty open set in $X$.\n\nThe problem states that $D$ is a dense subset of $X$. By the definition of a dense subset, any non-empty open set in $X$ must have a non-empty intersection with $D$. Since $V$ is a non-empty open set in $X$, it follows that $V \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset$.\nThis means there must exist at least one point, let's call it $d_0$, that is in both $V$ and $D$. So, $d_0 \\in V$ and $d_0 \\in D$.\n\nSince $d_0 \\in V = f^{-1}(U_1) \\cap g^{-1}(U_2)$, we know that $d_0 \\in f^{-1}(U_1)$ and $d_0 \\in g^{-1}(U_2)$.\nFrom $d_0 \\in f^{-1}(U_1)$, we can conclude that $f(d_0) \\in U_1$.\nFrom $d_0 \\in g^{-1}(U_2)$, we can conclude that $g(d_0) \\in U_2$.\n\nHowever, we also know that $d_0 \\in D$. The problem states that for all points $d \\in D$, we have $f(d) = g(d)$. Therefore, for our specific point $d_0$, it must be that $f(d_0) = g(d_0)$.\n\nLet's call this common value $y_0 = f(d_0) = g(d_0)$.\nFrom the reasoning above, we have $f(d_0) \\in U_1$, which means $y_0 \\in U_1$.\nWe also have $g(d_0) \\in U_2$, which means $y_0 \\in U_2$.\nIf $y_0$ is in both $U_1$ and $U_2$, it must be in their intersection: $y_0 \\in U_1 \\cap U_2$.\n\nBut this leads to a contradiction. The sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ were chosen specifically to be disjoint, meaning $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\emptyset$. It is impossible for the point $y_0$ to be an element of an empty set.\n\nOur initial assumption that there exists a point $x_0 \\in X$ for which $f(x_0) \\neq g(x_0)$ must be false. Therefore, it must be the case that $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nThis proves that statement A is necessarily true.\nStatement B is false because the Hausdorff property is required for the codomain $Y$, not the domain $X$.\nStatement C is the direct negation of our conclusion, so it is false.\nStatement D is false because the result does not depend on the functions being open maps, only on them being continuous.\nStatement E is false as the cardinality of the dense set $D$ is irrelevant; for example, the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ are a countable dense subset of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, but the irrational numbers are an uncountable dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.
