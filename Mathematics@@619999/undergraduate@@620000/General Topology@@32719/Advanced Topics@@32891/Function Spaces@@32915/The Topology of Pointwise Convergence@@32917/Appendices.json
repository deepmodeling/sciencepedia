The closure of a set, $\\overline{S}$, is the smallest closed set containing $S$. An equivalent definition is that a point $x$ is in $\\overline{S}$ if and only if every open neighborhood of $x$ has a non-empty intersection with $S$. We will show that $S$ is a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$, which means its closure is the entire space, $\\overline{S} = \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$.\n\nTo prove that $S$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$, we must show that for any arbitrary point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and any open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, we have $U \\cap S \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet $x = (x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be an arbitrary point in $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$.\nLet $U$ be an arbitrary open neighborhood of $x$. By the definition of the basis for the product topology, there exists a basic open set $B$ such that $x \\in B \\subseteq U$. If we can show that $B \\cap S \\neq \\emptyset$, then it will follow that $U \\cap S \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nA basic open set $B$ containing $x$ is defined by a finite set of indices, say $F = \\{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_m\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$, and a corresponding collection of open sets $\\{V_{k_1}, V_{k_2}, \\dots, V_{k_m}\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $x_{k_j} \\in V_{k_j}$ for each $j=1, \\dots, m$. The set $B$ is then given by:\n$$B = \\left\\{ (y_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}} \\mid y_{k_j} \\in V_{k_j} \\text{ for all } j=1, \\dots, m \\right\\}$$\nFor any index $n \\notin F$, there is no restriction on the component $y_n$.\n\nOur task is to construct a sequence $s = (s_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ such that $s \\in S$ and $s \\in B$.\n\nThe conditions for $s$ to be in $S$ are:\n1. $s_n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n2. There exists an integer $M$ such that $s_n = 0$ for all $n > M$.\n\nThe condition for $s$ to be in $B$ is:\n3. $s_{k_j} \\in V_{k_j}$ for all $j=1, \\dots, m$.\n\nLet's construct such a sequence $s$:\n\nFor each index $k_j \\in F$: We know that $V_{k_j}$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $x_{k_j} \\in V_{k_j}$. A fundamental property of the real numbers is that the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that any non-empty open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ contains at least one rational number. Therefore, for each $k_j \\in F$, we can choose a rational number, let's call it $q_{k_j}$, such that $q_{k_j} \\in V_{k_j}$. We define the corresponding component of our sequence $s$ as $s_{k_j} = q_{k_j}$.\n\nFor each index $n \\notin F$: The condition for being in the basic open set $B$ places no restriction on the component $s_n$. To satisfy the conditions for $s$ being in $S$, we must choose $s_n$ to be a rational number, and the sequence must be eventually zero. The simplest way to satisfy this is to set $s_n = 0$ for all $n \\notin F$. Note that $0$ is a rational number.\n\nNow, let's verify that the sequence $s$ we constructed has the required properties:\n- First, let's check if $s \\in B$. For each $k_j \\in F$, we chose $s_{k_j} = q_{k_j} \\in V_{k_j}$. This satisfies the condition for membership in $B$.\n- Second, let's check if $s \\in S$.\n    - Are all components of $s$ rational? Yes. For indices $n \\in F$, we chose $s_n$ to be a rational number. For indices $n \\notin F$, we set $s_n = 0$, which is also rational. So, $s_n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n    - Is $s$ eventually zero? Yes. If the finite index set $F$ is empty, then $s$ is the zero sequence, which is eventually zero. If $F$ is non-empty, let $M = \\max(F)$. For any integer $n > M$, it must be that $n \\notin F$. By our construction, for all $n \\notin F$, we have $s_n = 0$. Therefore, the sequence $s$ is eventually zero.\n\nSince we have successfully constructed a sequence $s$ that is in both $S$ and $B$ (and thus in $U$), we have shown that $B \\cap S \\neq \\emptyset$. As this holds for an arbitrary point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and an arbitrary neighborhood $U$ of $x$, we conclude that $S$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$.\n\nThe closure of a dense subset of a topological space is the space itself. Therefore, $\\overline{S} = \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A. The other options are incorrect:\n- B ($\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}$) is incorrect because we can approximate sequences containing irrational numbers. For example, the sequence $(\\pi, 0, 0, \\dots)$ is in $\\overline{S}$, but not in $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}$.\n- C (sequences converging to 0) is incorrect because we can approximate sequences that do not converge to zero. For example, the constant sequence $(1, 1, 1, \\dots)$ is in $\\overline{S}$, but does not converge to 0. This highlights a key difference between the product topology and the uniform topology.\n- D ($S$ itself) is incorrect because $S$ is not a closed set. For instance, the sequence of sequences $s^{(k)} = (1, 1/2, \\dots, 1/k, 0, 0, \\dots)$ consists of points in $S$, but it converges in the product topology to the sequence $(1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots)$, which is not in $S$.\n- E (real sequences that are eventually zero) is incorrect for the same reason as D; this set is not closed.
