Thus the open neighborhoods of $0$ are precisely the cofinite subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}$ that contain $0$.\n\nA local base at $0$ is a family $\\mathcal{B}_{0}$ of such neighborhoods. Let $\\mathcal{F}=\\{\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus B : B \\in \\mathcal{B}_{0}\\}$, which is a family of finite subsets of $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.

Therefore, the base condition means that for every finite $E \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, there exists $F \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with $E \\subseteq F$. Hence $\\mathcal{F}$ must be cofinal in the poset of finite subsets of $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ under inclusion.\n\nLower bound: no finite family of finite sets can be cofinal under inclusion. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{F}=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\}$, then $U=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}F_{i}$ is a finite subset of $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.

The restriction $q|_{X\\setminus A}:X\\setminus A\\to Y\\setminus\\{p^{*}\\}$ is a homeomorphism, since outside $A$ all equivalence classes are singletons. In each $S_{k}$, the points $(k,1/n)$ are isolated in the subspace topology of $S$, hence $\\{(k,1/n)\\}$ is open in $S_{k}$ and in $X$, and consequently $\\{q(k,1/n)\\}$ is open in $Y$.\n\nHausdorff property: We show $Y$ is Hausdorff.\n- If $y_{1},y_{2}\\in Y\\setminus\\{p^{*}\\}$ with $y_{1}\\neq y_{2}$, their preimages $x_1, x_2$ are distinct isolated points in $X$. Thus $\\{y_{1}\\}$ and $\\{y_{2}\\}$ are open, disjoint neighborhoods separating them.\n- If $y=p^{*}$ and $z\\in Y\\setminus\\{p^{*}\\}$, let $z=q(x)$ where $x \\in S_k \\setminus \\{p_k\\}$ for some $k$. Since $S_k$ is Hausdorff, we can find disjoint open sets $U,V$ in $S_k$ with $x \\in U$ and $p_k \\in V$. The set $q(U)$ is an open neighborhood of $z$. The set $W = V \\cup \\bigsqcup_{j \\ne k} S_j$ is a saturated open set in $X$, so $q(W)$ is an open neighborhood of $p^*$. As $U$ and $W$ are disjoint, so are $q(U)$ and $q(W)$.\nHence $Y$ is Hausdorff. Therefore option A is false.\n\nFirst-countability at $p^{*}$: Neighborhoods of $p^{*}$ in $Y$ correspond to open sets in $X$ containing $A$. For each $k$, a neighborhood of $p_{k}$ in $S_{k}$ must contain a tail $\\{(k,1/n):n\\geq N_{k}\\}$ for some $N_{k}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Thus any neighborhood $U$ of $p^{*}$ is determined (up to finitely many points in each $S_{k}$) by a function $M:\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ such that\n$$\nq^{-1}(U)\\cap S_{k}\\supset\\{p_{k}\\}\\cup\\{(k,1/n):n\\geq M(k)\\}\\quad\\text{for all }k.\n$$\nSuppose, towards a contradiction, that $\\{U^{(m)}\\}_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}}$ is a countable local base at $p^{*}$. For each $m$, choose a function $N^{(m)}:\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ witnessing that\n$$\nq^{-1}\\bigl(U^{(m)}\\bigr)\\cap S_{k}\\supset\\{p_{k}\\}\\cup\\{(k,1/n):n\\geq N^{(m)}(k)\\}\\quad\\text{for all }k.\n$$\nDefine a new function $M:\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ by\n$$\nM(k)=N^{(k)}(k)+1.\n$$\nLet $V$ be a neighborhood of $p^{*}$ with\n$$\nq^{-1}(V)\\cap S_{k}\\supset\\{p_{k}\\}\\cup\\{(k,1/n):n\\geq M(k)\\}\\quad\\text{for all }k.\n$$\nThen for each $m$, in spine $k=m$, we have $N^{(m)}(m)<M(m)$. This means there are points, like $(m, 1/N^{(m)}(m))$, which are in the tail defining $U^{(m)}$'s preimage but not in the tail defining $V$'s preimage. Hence $U^{(m)}\\nsubseteq V$ for every $m$. This contradicts that $\\{U^{(m)}\\}$ is a local base at $p^{*}$. Therefore $p^{*}$ does not have a countable local basis, so $Y$ is not first-countable. In particular, option B is false, and option D’s local-basis claim holds.\n\nSeparability and second-countability: The set $Y$ is countable, since it consists of $p^{*}$ together with the countable set $\\{(k,1/n):k,n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\}$. Any countable space is separable (itself is a countable dense subset), so $Y$ is separable. Therefore option C is false. Moreover, any second-countable space is first-countable; since $Y$ is not first-countable, it is not second-countable, which is consistent with rejecting option B.\n\nOpenness of $q$: A quotient map sends saturated open sets to open sets, but it need not be open on arbitrary open sets. Consider the open set $S_{1}\\subset X$. Its image $q(S_{1})$ contains $p^{*}$. If $q(S_{1})$ were open in $Y$, then $q^{-1}(q(S_{1}))=S_{1}\\cup A$ would be open in $X$. However, $S_{1}\\cup A$ is not open in $X$ because for $j\\neq 1$, any open neighborhood of $p_{j}$ in $S_{j}$ contains points of $S_{j}\\setminus\\{p_{j}\\}$, which are not in $S_{1}\\cup A$. Hence $q(S_{1})$ is not open, and $q$ is not an open map. Therefore option E is false.\n\nCollecting conclusions: $Y$ is Hausdorff, $p^{*}$ is not first-countable, $Y$ is separable, and $q$ is not open.
