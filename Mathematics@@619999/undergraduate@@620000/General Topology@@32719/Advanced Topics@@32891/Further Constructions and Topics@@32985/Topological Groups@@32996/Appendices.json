This exercise [@problem_id:1592184] challenges us to equip the familiar group of integers $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ with a less common topology—the cofinite topology—and rigorously check if the group operations of addition and inversion remain continuous. This practice is essential for developing a solid intuition for how algebraic and topological structures can sometimes fail to be compatible, and it highlights the non-trivial nature of the continuity axioms.", "problem": "Consider the group of integers under addition, $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$. We define a topology $\\tau$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$ called the cofinite topology. In this topology, a subset $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$ is declared \"open\" if and only if $U$ is the empty set or its complement, $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U$, is a finite set. This topology is neither the discrete topology (in which all subsets are open) nor the indiscrete topology (in which only $\\mathbb{Z}$ and the empty set are open).\n\nA topological group is a set that is both a group $(G, \\cdot)$ and a topological space $(G, \\tau)$, such that the group operations are continuous with respect to the topology $\\tau$. Specifically, two conditions must be met:\n1. The group's binary operation $m: G \\times G \\to G$, defined by $m(x, y) = x \\cdot y$, must be a continuous function. Here, the domain $G \\times G$ is endowed with the product topology.\n2.

Yes, it is a topological group.\n\nB. No, because the group operation (addition) is not continuous.\n\nC. No, because the inversion operation (negation) is not continuous.\n\nD. No, because both the group operation and the inversion operation are not continuous.", "solution": "We recall the definitions. On the infinite set $\\mathbb{Z}$, the cofinite topology declares a set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$ open if and only if $U=\\varnothing$ or $\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus U$ is finite. For a map $f:X\\to Y$ between topological spaces, $f$ is continuous if and only if for every open set $W\\subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(W)$ is open in $X$. For a topological group $(G,\\tau)$, we require that the multiplication map $m:G\\times G\\to G$ be continuous (with the product topology on $G\\times G$) and the inversion $i:G\\to G$ be continuous.\n\nFirst, check the inversion $i:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$, $i(x)=-x$. Let $U\\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$ be open. If $U=\\varnothing$, then $i^{-1}(U)=\\varnothing$ is open. If $U$ is cofinite, write $\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus U=F$ with $F$ finite.

Hence $i^{-1}(U)$ is cofinite, thus open. Therefore inversion is continuous.\n\nNext, check the addition map $m:\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$, $m(x,y)=x+y$, with the product topology on $\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}$. A neighborhood basis at a point $(a,b)$ in the product topology consists of sets of the form $U\\times V$ with $U,V\\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$ open in the cofinite topology. Thus $U$ and $V$ are cofinite (nonempty neighborhoods cannot be empty), so write $\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus U=A$ and $\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus V=B$ with $A,B$ finite. We claim that for any such cofinite $U,V$,\n$$\nm(U\\times V)=U+V=\\{u+v:u\\in U,\\ v\\in V\\}=\\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\nTo prove this, fix any $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Consider the finite set $S=B\\cup(n-A)$, where $n-A=\\{n-a:a\\in A\\}$. Since $B$ and $A$ are finite, $S$ is finite, hence $\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus S$ is nonempty. Choose $v\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\setminus S$. Then $v\\notin B$, so $v\\in V$, and also $v\\notin n-A$, so $n-v\\notin A$, hence $u:=n-v\\in U$. Therefore $n=u+v\\in U+V$. As $n$ was arbitrary, $U+V=\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow take any nontrivial open set $W\\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$, so $W$ is cofinite but $W\\neq \\mathbb{Z}$; let $\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus W=F$ with $F$ finite and nonempty. For continuity of $m$ at a point $(a,b)$ with $a+b\\in W$, we would need a neighborhood $U\\times V$ of $(a,b)$ such that $m(U\\times V)\\subseteq W$. However, for any such neighborhood with $U,V$ open (hence cofinite), we have shown $m(U\\times V)=\\mathbb{Z}$, which cannot be contained in $W$ because $W\\neq \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore no such neighborhood exists, and $m$ is not continuous.\n\nWe conclude: inversion is continuous, addition is not.
