It implies that a set $U$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_f$ if and only if $f^{-1}(U \\cap [0, \\infty))$ is an open set in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{usual}})$. The part of $U$ consisting of negative numbers, $U \\cap (-\\infty, 0)$, has an empty preimage, $f^{-1}(U \\cap (-\\infty, 0)) = \\emptyset$. Since the empty set is always open, this part of $U$ does not affect whether the total preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is open.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to characterizing the subsets $V \\subseteq [0, \\infty)$ for which $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$. This is precisely the definition of the quotient topology on $[0, \\infty)$ induced by the quotient map $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to [0, \\infty)$. Let's show that this quotient topology is identical to the usual subspace topology on $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{T}_q$ be the quotient topology on $[0, \\infty)$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$ be the usual subspace topology on $[0, \\infty)$.\n\n1.  **Show $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_q$**:\n    We need to show that if a set $V$ is open in the subspace topology on $[0, \\infty)$, then its preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    A basis for $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$ on $[0, \\infty)$ consists of sets of the form $[0, a)$ for $a > 0$, and $(b, c)$ for $0 \\le b < c$. It is sufficient to check the preimages of these basis elements.\n    - For a basis element of the form $V = [0, a)$:\n      $f^{-1}([0, a)) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0 \\le x^2 < a\\} = (-\\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{a})$. This is an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, hence open in $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{usual}}$.\n    - For a basis element of the form $V = (b, c)$ where $0 \\le b < c$:\n      $f^{-1}((b, c)) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid b < x^2 < c\\} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\sqrt{b} < |x| < \\sqrt{c}\\} = (-\\sqrt{c}, -\\sqrt{b}) \\cup (\\sqrt{b}, \\sqrt{c})$. This is a union of two open intervals, hence open in $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{usual}}$.\n    Since the preimages of all basis elements of $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$ are open in $\\mathbb{R}$, the preimage of any arbitrary open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$ (which is a union of such basis elements) is also open in $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_q$.\n\n2.  **Show $\\mathcal{T}_q \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$**:\n    We need to show that if $V \\subseteq [0, \\infty)$ is in $\\mathcal{T}_q$ (meaning $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$), then $V$ is open in the subspace topology, $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$.\n    Let $y$ be an arbitrary point in $V$. We must find a neighborhood of $y$ in the subspace topology that is contained in $V$.\n    - **Case 1: $y = 0$**. Since $0 \\in V$, its preimage $f^{-1}(\\{0\\}) = \\{0\\}$ is contained in the open set $f^{-1}(V)$. As $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set containing $0$, there must exist an open interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\subseteq f^{-1}(V)$. Applying the function $f$ to this interval gives $f((-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)) = [0, \\epsilon^2)$. Since all elements of $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ are in the preimage of $V$, their images must be in $V$. Thus, $[0, \\epsilon^2) \\subseteq V$. The set $[0, \\epsilon^2)$ is an open neighborhood of $0$ in the subspace topology on $[0, \\infty)$.\n    - **Case 2: $y > 0$**. Since $y \\in V$, its preimage $f^{-1}(\\{y\\}) = \\{-\\sqrt{y}, \\sqrt{y}\\}$ is contained in the open set $f^{-1}(V)$. Because $f^{-1}(V)$ is open, there must exist open intervals around $\\sqrt{y}$ and $-\\sqrt{y}$ that are entirely contained in $f^{-1}(V)$. For instance, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $(\\sqrt{y}-\\delta, \\sqrt{y}+\\delta) \\subseteq f^{-1}(V)$, assuming $\\delta$ is small enough that $\\sqrt{y}-\\delta > 0$. Applying $f$ to this interval gives $f((\\sqrt{y}-\\delta, \\sqrt{y}+\\delta)) = ((\\sqrt{y}-\\delta)^2, (\\sqrt{y}+\\delta)^2)$, which is an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $y$. This interval is also a neighborhood of $y$ in the subspace topology on $[0, \\infty)$, and it is entirely contained in $V$.\n    In both cases, for any $y \\in V$, we found a neighborhood of $y$ in the subspace topology that is contained in $V$. This means $V$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{T}_q \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_q$ and $\\mathcal{T}_q \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$, the two topologies are identical: $\\mathcal{T}_q = \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$.\n\nWe have shown that a set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_f$ if and only if $U \\cap [0, \\infty)$ is open in the quotient topology $\\mathcal{T}_q$ on $[0, \\infty)$, which is the same as the usual subspace topology $\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sub}}$ on $[0, \\infty)$. This directly corresponds to option D.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n- A: Incorrect. For example, $U = \\{-1\\}$. The preimage is $f^{-1}(\\{-1\\})=\\emptyset$, which is open. So $U$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_f$. However, $\\{-1\\}$ is not open in the usual topology.\n- B: Incorrect. For example, $U = \\{1\\}$. The preimage is $f^{-1}(\\{1\\})=\\{-1, 1\\}$, which is not open in the usual topology. So $\\{1\\}$ is not open in $\\mathcal{T}_f$.\n- C: Incorrect. This is not a standard definition. Take any open set $U$ containing $1$. The condition fails for $y=1$ because $f^{-1}(\\{1\\})=\\{-1, 1\\}$ is not open.\n- E: Incorrect. Consider the set $U = \\{0\\}$. According to this rule, $U \\cap (0, \\infty) = \\emptyset$, which is open in $\\mathbb{R}$, and $U \\cap (-\\infty, 0] = \\{0\\}$. So, this rule would classify $U=\\{0\\}$ as open. However, $f^{-1}(\\{0\\}) = \\{0\\}$, which is not an open set in the usual topology, so $\\{0\\}$ is not open in $\\mathcal{T}_f$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1553695"}]}
