The particular point topology $\\mathcal{T}_{p}$ is $\\mathcal{T}_{p}=\\{\\emptyset\\}\\cup\\{U\\subseteq X: p\\in U\\}$; that is, a set is open if and only if it is empty or contains $p$.\n\nTo test whether $(X,\\mathcal{T}_{p})$ is a k-space, we must determine the compact subsets of $X$ and then check whether the following equivalence holds for all $A\\subseteq X$: $A$ is closed in $X$ if and only if for every compact $K\\subseteq X$, the intersection $A\\cap K$ is closed in the subspace $K$.\n\nFirst, we characterize the subspace topologies:\n- If $F\\subseteq X$ with $p\\notin F$, then for any $U\\in\\mathcal{T}_{p}$, $U\\cap F$ can be any subset of $F$ (choose $U=V\\cup\\{p\\}$ for $V\\subseteq F$), hence the subspace $F$ is discrete.\n- If $F\\subseteq X$ with $p\\in F$, then the subspace topology on $F$ is again the particular point topology with distinguished point $p$: the open sets in $F$ are exactly $\\emptyset$ and those subsets that contain $p$.\n\nNext, we determine the compact subsets of $X$.\n- Any finite subset $K$ is compact: given any open cover of $K$, select for each point $x\\in K$ an open set containing $x$, obtaining a finite subcover.\n- If $K$ is infinite and $p\\notin K$, then $K$ is an infinite discrete space, which is not compact (it is covered by the family of singletons).\n- If $K$ is infinite and $p\\in K$, consider the open cover $\\{\\{p,x\\}: x\\in K\\}$ of $K$ (each $\\{p,x\\}$ is open in the subspace since it is $K\\cap U$ with $U=\\{p,x\\}\\in\\mathcal{T}_{p}$). Any finite subfamily covers only finitely many points of $K\\setminus\\{p\\}$, so it cannot cover $K$. Hence $K$ is not compact.\n\nTherefore, the compact subsets of $(X,\\mathcal{T}_{p})$ are precisely the finite subsets.\n\nWe now analyze the k-space condition. Let $A\\subseteq X$, and require that for every compact $F\\subseteq X$ (equivalently, every finite $F$), the set $A\\cap F$ is closed in the subspace $F$. We describe closed subsets of finite subspaces $F$:\n- If $p\\notin F$, then $F$ is discrete, so every subset of $F$ is closed.\n- If $p\\in F$, then $F$ has the particular point topology, so its open subsets are exactly $\\emptyset$ and sets containing $p$. Hence a subset $C\\subseteq F$ is closed in $F$ if and only if either $p\\notin C$ or $C=F$.\n\nImpose this condition on $A$:\n- If $p\\notin A$, then for any finite $F$ with $p\\in F$, $A\\cap F$ does not contain $p$, so it is closed in $F$. For $p\\notin F$, there is no restriction. Thus any $A$ with $p\\notin A$ satisfies the k-closed condition.\n- If $p\\in A$, then for every finite $F$ with $p\\in F$, we must have $A\\cap F=F$ (since $A\\cap F$ contains $p$, the only way it is closed in $F$ is to equal $F$). This forces $F\\subseteq A$ for every finite $F$ containing $p$. Taking $F=\\{p,x\\}$ for arbitrary $x\\in X$ yields $x\\in A$, hence $A=X$.\n\nThus the subsets $A$ that satisfy the k-closed condition are exactly all subsets not containing $p$ together with $X$ itself. These are precisely the closed sets of $(X,\\mathcal{T}_{p})$, since in the particular point topology the closed sets are $X$ and all subsets whose complements are open, i.e., those not containing $p$.\n\nTherefore, a subset $A$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $A\\cap K$ is closed in $K$ for every compact $K\\subseteq X$. Hence $(X,\\mathcal{T}_{p})$ is a k-space.

Hence every $x\\neq 0$ is an isolated point.\n- $X\\setminus\\{0\\}$ is open because it does not contain $0$, so $\\{0\\}$ is closed. For $x\\neq 0$, $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ contains $0$ and its complement $\\{x\\}$ is countable, hence $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is open, so $\\{x\\}$ is closed. Therefore all singletons are closed and the space is $T_{1}$.\n- The space is Hausdorff: if $x,y\\neq 0$ and $x\\neq y$, then $\\{x\\}$ and $\\{y\\}$ are disjoint open neighborhoods. If $x=0$ and $y\\neq 0$, take $U=X\\setminus\\{y\\}$, which is open and contains $0$, and $V=\\{y\\}$, which is open; then $U\\cap V=\\varnothing$.\n\nNext, compact subsets. We claim that the compact subsets of $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ are exactly the finite subsets.\n\n1. Every finite subset $K\\subseteq X$ is compact. Indeed, given any open cover of $K$, select one open set from the cover containing each point of $K$; since $K$ is finite, this yields a finite subcover.\n\n2. No infinite subset $K\\subseteq X$ is compact.\n- If $0\\notin K$ and $K$ is infinite, then $\\{\\{x\\}:x\\in K\\}$ is an open cover of $K$ with no finite subcover, because any finite subfamily covers only finitely many points of $K$.\n- If $0\\in K$ and $K$ is infinite, choose a countably infinite subset $S\\subseteq K\\setminus\\{0\\}$. The family $\\{X \\setminus S\\} \\cup \\{\\{s\\} : s \\in S\\}$ is an open cover of $K$. $X \\setminus S$ is open since its complement $S$ is countable. Each $\\{s\\}$ for $s \\in S \\subseteq X \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is open. This cover has no finite subcover because any finite subfamily will miss all but finitely many points of the infinite set $S$.\n\nTherefore, the only compact subsets of $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ are finite sets.\n\nNow assess the $k$-space property. In a $k$-space, a set $A\\subseteq X$ is closed if and only if $A\\cap K$ is closed in the subspace $K$ for every compact $K\\subseteq X$. Since in our space the compact subsets are exactly the finite subsets, it suffices to analyze finite $K$.\n\nLet $K\\subseteq X$ be finite. We show that the subspace $K$ is discrete, hence every subset of $K$ is both open and closed in $K$.\n- If $0\\notin K$, then for any $B\\subseteq K$, the set $B$ is open in $X$ (it does not contain $0$), so $B=B\\cap K$ is open in the subspace $K$.\n- If $0\\in K$, then for any $B\\subseteq K$ with $0\\notin B$, $B$ is open in $X$, hence open in $K$. For any $B\\subseteq K$ with $0\\in B$, let $S=K\\setminus B$, which is finite and thus countable; then $X\\setminus S$ is open in $X$ and contains $0$, and $B=(X\\setminus S)\\cap K$ is open in $K$.\nThus every subset of $K$ is open, hence also closed, in $K$.\n\nConsequently, for any $A\\subseteq X$ and any compact $K$ (hence finite), $A\\cap K$ is always closed in $K$. If $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ were a $k$-space, this would force every subset $A\\subseteq X$ to be closed in $X$. But this would mean $X$ has the discrete topology, which is not the case (e.g., the set of irrational numbers does not contain 0 and is not open, but its complement contains 0 and is not countable). More simply, $X\\setminus\\{0\\}$ is open (it does not contain $0$) and not empty, but it is not closed, since its complement $\\{0\\}$ is not open. This contradiction shows that $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ is not compactly generated.\n\nThe reason it fails is that the collection of compact sets (only the finite sets) is too small to \"detect\" all the closed sets of the topology. Thus the correct statement is that the Fortissimo space is not compactly generated because its only compact subsets are finite sets.\n\nThis matches option C; options A, B, D, and E are false for the reasons above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1538890"}, {"introduction": "Manually verifying the k-space definition for every new space is impractical.

Proof: Let $X$ be first-countable. Suppose $A \\subseteq X$ has the property that for every compact $K \\subseteq X$, the set $A \\cap K$ is closed in $K$. We show $A$ is closed. Argue by contrapositive: assume $A$ is not closed, so there exists $x \\in \\overline{A} \\setminus A$. Since $X$ is first-countable, there is a sequence $(a_{n})_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ in $A$ with $a_{n} \\to x$. Consider the set $K = \\{x\\} \\cup \\{a_{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.
