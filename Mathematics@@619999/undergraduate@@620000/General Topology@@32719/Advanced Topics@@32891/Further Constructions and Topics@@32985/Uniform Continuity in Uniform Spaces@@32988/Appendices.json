This set forms a group under the operation of function composition. We can identify each transformation $f_{a,b}$ with the pair $(a,b)$, so $G = (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The group operation is given by $(a_1, b_1) \\circ (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 a_2, a_1 b_2 + b_1)$.

The condition $g^{-1}h \\in U$ is equivalent to $k \\in U$. If this holds, then $h = gk$.\nNow, we substitute $h = gk$ into the consequence $gh^{-1} \\in V$:\n$gh^{-1} = g(gk)^{-1} = g(k^{-1}g^{-1}) = gk^{-1}g^{-1}$.\nSo, the condition on $U$ and $V$ is that for all $g \\in G$ and for all $k \\in U$, we must have $gk^{-1}g^{-1} \\in V$.\nLet $u = k^{-1}$. As $k$ ranges over all elements of the neighborhood $U$, $u=k^{-1}$ ranges over all elements of the set $U^{-1} = \\{x^{-1} \\mid x \\in U\\}$. Since the inversion map $i(g) = g^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism in a topological group, $U^{-1}$ is also an open neighborhood of the identity $e$.\nThus, the condition for uniform continuity of inversion is equivalent to:\nFor every open neighborhood $V$ of $e$, there exists an open neighborhood $U'$ of $e$ (we can rename it to $U$) such that for all $g \\in G$ and for all $u \\in U$, we have $gug^{-1} \\in V$. This can be written more concisely as: for every $V$, there exists a $U$ such that for all $g \\in G$, $gUg^{-1} \\subseteq V$.\n\nWe will now test if this condition holds for the given affine group $G$. We will attempt to prove it false by finding a counterexample, as suggested by option C. We need to find a specific neighborhood $V$ of $e$ for which this condition fails.\n\nLet's pick a specific open neighborhood of the identity $e=(1,0)$:\n$V = \\{ (x,y) \\in G : |x-1|  \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ and } |y|  1 \\}$.\n\nNow, let $U$ be an arbitrary open neighborhood of $e=(1,0)$. By the definition of the product topology, any such $U$ must contain a smaller open \"box\" neighborhood of the form:\n$U_\\epsilon = \\{ (a,b) \\in G : |a-1|  \\epsilon \\text{ and } |b|  \\epsilon \\}$ for some small $\\epsilon > 0$.\nIf we can show that for any such $U_\\epsilon$, there is a $g \\in G$ such that $gU_\\epsilon g^{-1} \\not\\subseteq V$, then we have shown that uniform continuity fails.\n\nLet's take an arbitrary element $g = (c,d) \\in G$ (with $c \\neq 0$) and an arbitrary element $u = (a,b) \\in U_\\epsilon$. We compute the conjugate element $gug^{-1}$:\n$g^{-1} = (1/c, -d/c)$.\n$gug^{-1} = (c,d) \\circ (a,b) \\circ (1/c, -d/c)$\n$= (ca, cb+d) \\circ (1/c, -d/c)$\n$= (ca \\cdot 1/c, ca(-d/c) + cb+d)$\n$= (a, -ad + bc + d) = (a, bc + d(1-a))$.\n\nSo, for $u=(a,b) \\in U_\\epsilon$, we have $gug^{-1} = (a', b')$, where $a' = a$ and $b' = bc + d(1-a)$.\nWe want to show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find $u \\in U_\\epsilon$ and $g \\in G$ such that $gug^{-1} \\notin V$.\nFor $u=(a,b) \\in U_\\epsilon$, we have $|a-1|  \\epsilon$. Let's assume $\\epsilon  1/2$. Then for the conjugate point $(a',b')$, we have $|a'-1| = |a-1|  \\epsilon  1/2$. This means the first condition to be in $V$ is always satisfied for elements in the image of the conjugation.\nTherefore, to show $gug^{-1} \\notin V$, we must show that we can make the second component $|b'| = |bc + d(1-a)| \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's make a strategic choice for $u \\in U_\\epsilon$ and $g \\in G$. For any given $\\epsilon > 0$, choose the element $u = (1-\\epsilon/2, 0) \\in U_\\epsilon$. For this choice, $a=1-\\epsilon/2$ and $b=0$. The term $1-a = 1 - (1-\\epsilon/2) = \\epsilon/2$.\nThe second component of the conjugate becomes $b' = 0 \\cdot c + d(1-(1-\\epsilon/2)) = d(\\epsilon/2)$.\nWe want to make $|b'| \\ge 1$, which means $|d(\\epsilon/2)| \\ge 1$. This is equivalent to $|d| \\ge 2/\\epsilon$.\nWe are free to choose any $g=(c,d) \\in G$. So, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $c=1$ and $d = 2/\\epsilon$. This gives an element $g=(1, 2/\\epsilon) \\in G$.\n\nLet's summarize the counterexample:\n1.  Fix the neighborhood $V = \\{ (x,y) \\in G : |x-1|  1/2, |y|  1 \\}$.\n2.  Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $e$. It contains some $U_\\epsilon$ for $\\epsilon>0$. Let's assume $\\epsilon  1/2$.\n3.  Choose the element $u = (1-\\epsilon/2, 0)$, which is in $U_\\epsilon$ and hence in $U$.\n4.  Choose the group element $g = (1, 2/\\epsilon)$.\n5.  Compute the conjugate: $gug^{-1} = (1-\\epsilon/2, (2/\\epsilon)(\\epsilon/2)) = (1-\\epsilon/2, 1)$.\nThe resulting point $(1-\\epsilon/2, 1)$ has a second component equal to 1. Since $V$ is defined by the strict inequality $|y|1$, this point is not in $V$.\n\nThis construction shows that for the chosen $V$, for any neighborhood $U$ of the identity, we can find an element $u \\in U$ and an element $g \\in G$ such that $gug^{-1} \\notin V$. Therefore, the condition for uniform continuity of the inversion map is not satisfied.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA is incorrect. While inversion is a homeomorphism, this is a local property and does not guarantee uniform continuity, which is a global property related to the uniform structure.\nB is incorrect. While $G$ is a Lie group, uniform continuity of inversion is not a general property of all Lie groups with respect to the left (or right) uniformity. It is true for the two-sided uniformity, which is generally different.\nC is correct. It precisely describes the failure of the uniform continuity condition, and we have explicitly carried out the construction it suggests.\nD is incorrect. While inversion is uniformly continuous for abelian groups (where $gug^{-1}=u$), it is not *exclusively* for them. For example, all compact topological groups (many of which are non-abelian, like $SO(3)$) have uniformly continuous inversion with respect to either one-sided uniformity.\n\nThus, the correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1593902"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice shifts from constructing counterexamples to leveraging the power of abstract definitions in proving general results.
