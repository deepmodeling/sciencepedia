Here $X_{n}=[0,1]$ and $f_{n,n+1}(x)=\\sqrt{x}$. For $n<k$ we have $f_{n,k}(x)=x^{1/2^{k-n}}$. Each $f_{n,n+1}$ is a homeomorphism of $[0,1]$ with inverse $x\\mapsto x^{2}$. Consequently, for every $n<k$, $f_{n,k}$ is a homeomorphism as a composition of homeomorphisms. In the disjoint union $\\bigsqcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}X_{n}$, the equivalence relation identifies $(n,x)$ with $(k,f_{n,k}(x))$ bijectively along the levels. Hence every equivalence class meets each level in exactly one point. It follows that the canonical map $i_{n}:X_{n}\\to X_{\\infty}$ is a bijection for each $n$. Consider the bijection $\\phi:X_{\\infty}\\to[0,1]$ defined by $\\phi([n,x])=f_{n,1}^{-1}(x)=x^{2^{n-1}}$. For each $n$, $\\phi\\circ i_{n}(x)=x^{2^{n-1}}$ is a homeomorphism of $[0,1]$, so by the universal property of the colimit, $\\phi$ is continuous; in the same way, its inverse is continuous. Therefore $X_{\\infty}$ is homeomorphic to $[0,1]$ with the Euclidean topology. Consequently, $X_{\\infty}$ is T1, Hausdorff, connected, compact, and path-connected.\n\nSecond system. Here $Y_{n}=[0,1]$ and\n$$\ng_{n,n+1}(x)=\\begin{cases}\n2x & \\text{if } 0\\leq x\\leq \\frac{1}{2},\\\\\n1 & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2}<x\\leq 1.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWrite $g=g_{n,n+1}$ for the common bonding map and $g^{k}$ for its $k$-fold iterate. For $x=0$, $g^{k}(0)=0$ for all $k$. For any $x\\in(0,1]$, choose $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $2^{k}x>\\frac{1}{2}$. Then $g^{k}(x)\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1]$ and $g^{k+1}(x)=1$, and $g(1)=1$, so every $x\\in(0,1]$ eventually maps to the fixed point $1$. Thus in the disjoint union, the equivalence classes are:\n- $C_{0}=\\{(n,0):n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$,\n- $C_{1}=\\{(n,x):n\\in\\mathbb{N},\\,x\\in(0,1]\\}$.\nTherefore $Y_{\\infty}$ has exactly two points, say $a=[C_{0}]$ and $b=[C_{1}]$.\n\nTo determine the topology, recall that a subset $U\\subseteq\\{a,b\\}$ is open in the final topology if and only if $i_{n}^{-1}(U)$ is open in $[0,1]$ for every $n$. The canonical map $i_{n}:Y_{n}\\to Y_{\\infty}$ is given by $i_{n}(0)=a$ and $i_{n}(x)=b$ for all $x\\in(0,1]$.
