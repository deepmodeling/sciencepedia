Your task is to identify all options below which serve as a counterexample to this proposition.\n\nFor all options, the topological space is the set of real numbers, $X = \\mathbb{R}$, equipped with its standard topology. In the standard topology, a set is considered open if it can be expressed as a union of open intervals.

An option provides a counterexample if and only if both sets $A$ and $B$ are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, but their intersection $A \\cap B$ is not dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThe sets are $A = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$ and $B = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}^+$.\nFirst, we check if $A$ and $B$ are dense.\nA set $S$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ if its complement $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus S$ contains no interval. The complement of $A$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$, and the complement of $B$ is $\\mathbb{Z}^+$. Both $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}^+$ are sets of isolated points and contain no open intervals. Therefore, both $A$ and $B$ are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nAlternatively, consider any non-empty open interval $(a, b)$. This interval contains uncountably many points. The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is countable. So, $(a, b)$ must contain points not in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $A = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$ is dense. A similar argument shows $B = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}^+$ is also dense.\nNext, we find the intersection:\n$A \\cap B = (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}) \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}^+)$.\nThis is the set of all real numbers that are neither integers nor positive integers. Since the set of positive integers $\\mathbb{Z}^+$ is a subset of the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, the union $\\mathbb{Z} \\cup \\mathbb{Z}^+$ is simply $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $A \\cap B = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus (\\mathbb{Z} \\cup \\mathbb{Z}^+) = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFinally, we check if the intersection $A \\cap B = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$ is dense. As we established above, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$ is a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\nSince the intersection is dense, this is not a counterexample.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe sets are $A = \\mathbb{Q}$ and $B = \\{q + \\sqrt{3} \\mid q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$.\nFirst, we check for density. $A = \\mathbb{Q}$ is given as dense. For set $B$, consider any non-empty open interval $(a, b)$. We need to show there is a point from $B$ in this interval. This means we need to find a $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < q + \\sqrt{3} < b$. This inequality is equivalent to $a - \\sqrt{3} < q < b - \\sqrt{3}$. The interval $(a - \\sqrt{3}, b - \\sqrt{3})$ has positive length, and since the rational numbers are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, this interval must contain a rational number $q$. For such a $q$, the number $q + \\sqrt{3}$ is in $B$ and lies in $(a, b)$. Thus, $B$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nNext, we find the intersection $A \\cap B$. Suppose there is an element $x \\in A \\cap B$. Then $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $x \\in B$. If $x \\in B$, then $x = q + \\sqrt{3}$ for some $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This would mean $x - q = \\sqrt{3}$. Since $x$ and $q$ are both rational numbers, their difference $x-q$ must be rational. However, $\\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the intersection must be empty: $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\nFinally, we check if $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$ is dense. The closure of the empty set is the empty set itself. For a set to be dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, its closure must be $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\overline{\\emptyset} = \\emptyset \\neq \\mathbb{R}$, the empty set is not dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. For example, the open interval $(0, 1)$ contains no points from $\\emptyset$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are dense but their intersection is not, this is a counterexample.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe sets are $A = \\mathbb{Q}$ and $B = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIt is given in the problem statement that both $A$ (the rationals) and $B$ (the irrationals) are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe intersection is $A \\cap B = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q})$, which is the set of numbers that are both rational and irrational. This set is, by definition, the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\nAs established in the analysis of option B, the empty set is not dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are dense but their intersection is not, this is a counterexample.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThe sets are $A = \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$ and $B = (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}) \\cup \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$.\nFirst, we check for density. For set $A$, any open interval $(a, b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers but only a finite number of integers. Therefore, it must contain a rational number that is not an integer. So, $A = \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$ is dense.\nFor set $B$, let $(a, b)$ be any non-empty open interval. Since the irrationals $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ are dense, there is an irrational number $y \\in (a, b)$. This $y$ is in $B$. Thus, $B$ intersects every non-empty open interval and is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nNext, we find the intersection:\n$A \\cap B = (\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}) \\cap ((\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}) \\cup \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\})$.\nWe can distribute the intersection over the union:\n$A \\cap B = ((\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}) \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q})) \\cup ((\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}) \\cap \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\})$.\nThe first part, $(\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}) \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q})$, is an intersection of a subset of rational numbers with the irrational numbers, which is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\nThe second part is $(\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}) \\cap \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a rational number but not an integer, it is an element of $\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the intersection is $\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$.\nThe union is $\\emptyset \\cup \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. So, $A \\cap B = \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$.\nFinally, we check if $A \\cap B = \\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$ is dense. A finite set is never dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. Its closure is the set itself. The closure of $\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$ is $\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\}$, which is not $\\mathbb{R}$. For instance, the open interval $(1, 2)$ contains no point from this set. Thus, the intersection is not dense.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are dense but their intersection is not, this is a counterexample.\n\nIn summary, options B, C, and D are all valid counterexamples to the proposition, while option A is not.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCD}$$", "id": "1549027"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the intersection of dense sets is not guaranteed to be dense, let's take a more constructive approach.

Characterizing Closed Sets**\nA set $F \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is closed if its complement, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus F$, is open. According to the definition of the cofinite topology, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus F$ is open if it is the empty set or it is a set whose complement is finite.\n- If $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus F = \\emptyset$, then $F = \\mathbb{R}$.

Understanding Closure and Density**\nThe closure of a set $A$, denoted $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$, is the smallest closed set that contains $A$. A set $A$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ if $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nUsing our characterization of closed sets, we can determine the closure for any subset $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$:\n- If $A$ is a finite set, then $A$ itself is a closed set. Since $A$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$, its closure is itself: $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) = A$. In this case, $A$ is not dense unless $A=\\mathbb{R}$, which is impossible for a finite set.\n- If $A$ is an infinite set, it cannot be contained in any finite closed set. The only other type of closed set is $\\mathbb{R}$ itself. Therefore, the smallest closed set containing an infinite set $A$ must be $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, for any infinite set $A$, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis gives us a simple criterion: A subset $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is dense in the cofinite topology if and only if $A$ is an infinite set.\n\nNow we analyze each option based on this criterion.\n\n**A.
