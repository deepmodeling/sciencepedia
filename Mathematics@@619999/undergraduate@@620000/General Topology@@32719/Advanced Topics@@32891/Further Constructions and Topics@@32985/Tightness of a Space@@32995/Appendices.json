We want to find the tightness at the origin, $t(\\mathbf{0}, X)$. The solution involves establishing a lower and an upper bound for this value.\n\nFirst, we establish an upper bound for $t(\\mathbf{0}, X)$. By definition, $t(\\mathbf{0}, X)$ is the smallest cardinal $\\kappa$ such that for any $A \\subseteq X$ with $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{A}$, there is a subset $B \\subseteq A$ with $|B| \\le \\kappa$ and $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{B}$. Let's consider any set $A$ such that $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{A}$. We can choose $B = A$. The cardinality of $A$ is at most the cardinality of the entire space $X = \\mathbb{R}^2$, which is $\\mathfrak{c}$. So, we can always find such a subset $B$ (namely $A$ itself) with $|B| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, by the definition of tightness, we must have $t(\\mathbf{0}, X) \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nNext, we establish a lower bound for $t(\\mathbf{0}, X)$. To do this, we need to find a specific set $A \\subseteq X$ such that $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{A}$, but for any subset $B \\subseteq A$ with cardinality $|B| < \\mathfrak{c}$, we have $\\mathbf{0} \\notin \\overline{B}$. If we can find such a set $A$, it will imply that the smallest possible cardinality for a sub-set $B$ of $A$ with $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{B}$ is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. This would mean $t(\\mathbf{0}, X) \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nLet's construct such a set $A$. An ideal candidate is the unit circle, $A = S^1 = \\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2+y^2=1 \\}$. The cardinality of $A$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nStep 1: Show that $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{A}$.\nTo show this, we must prove that every neighborhood of $\\mathbf{0}$ intersects $A$. Let $U$ be an arbitrary neighborhood of $\\mathbf{0}$. Then $U$ must contain a basic open set $N_C$ containing $\\mathbf{0}$, where $N_C = (\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\bigcup_{L \\in C} L) \\cup \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$ for some collection of lines $C$ through the origin with $|C| < \\mathfrak{c}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all lines passing through the origin. The cardinality of $\\mathcal{L}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (it can be parameterized by the slopes in $\\mathbb{R}$ plus one vertical line).\nSince $|C| < \\mathfrak{c}$ and $|\\mathcal{L}| = \\mathfrak{c}$, the set difference $\\mathcal{L} \\setminus C$ is non-empty. Let $L_0$ be a line in $\\mathcal{L} \\setminus C$. This line $L_0$ intersects the unit circle $A$ at two distinct points, say $p$ and $-p$.\nConsider the point $p$. Since $p \\in L_0$ and $L_0 \\notin C$, $p$ does not belong to any line in $C$. Therefore, $p \\notin \\bigcup_{L \\in C} L$. This implies that $p \\in (\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\bigcup_{L \\in C} L)$, and so $p \\in N_C$.\nSince $p \\in A$ and $p \\in N_C$, the intersection $A \\cap N_C$ is non-empty. As $N_C \\subseteq U$, the intersection $A \\cap U$ is also non-empty. Since $U$ was an arbitrary neighborhood of $\\mathbf{0}$, we conclude that $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{A}$.\n\nStep 2: Show that for any subset $B \\subseteq A$ with $|B| < \\mathfrak{c}$, we have $\\mathbf{0} \\notin \\overline{B}$.\nLet $B$ be any subset of $A = S^1$ with $|B| < \\mathfrak{c}$. To show that $\\mathbf{0} \\notin \\overline{B}$, we need to find a neighborhood of $\\mathbf{0}$ that is disjoint from $B$.\nFor each point $b \\in B$, let $L_b$ be the unique line passing through the origin $\\mathbf{0}$ and $b$. Let $C_B = \\{ L_b \\mid b \\in B \\}$ be the collection of all such lines. Since each line can contain at most two points of the circle $S^1$, the mapping from $B$ to $C_B$ is at most two-to-one. Therefore, $|C_B| \\le |B| < \\mathfrak{c}$.\nNow, consider the set $U_B = (\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\bigcup_{L \\in C_B} L) \\cup \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$. According to the definition of the topology, since $C_B$ is a collection of lines through the origin with cardinality $|C_B| < \\mathfrak{c}$, the set $U_B$ is a basic open neighborhood of $\\mathbf{0}$.\nLet's check if $U_B$ intersects $B$. For any point $b \\in B$, it lies on its corresponding line $L_b$, which is an element of $C_B$. Thus, every point in $B$ is contained in the set $\\bigcup_{L \\in C_B} L$. This means no point of $B$ can be in the set $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\bigcup_{L \\in C_B} L$. Consequently, the intersection $U_B \\cap B$ is empty.\nWe have found a neighborhood of $\\mathbf{0}$ (namely $U_B$) that is disjoint from $B$, which proves that $\\mathbf{0} \\notin \\overline{B}$.\n\nFrom these two steps, we have a set $A=S^1$ where $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{A}$, and for any subset $B \\subseteq A$, if $\\mathbf{0} \\in \\overline{B}$, then it must be that $|B| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$. According to the definition of tightness, $t(\\mathbf{0}, X)$ is the smallest cardinal $\\kappa$ for which such a subset $B$ with $|B| \\le \\kappa$ exists. Our result shows that this smallest cardinal must be at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. Thus, $t(\\mathbf{0}, X) \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nCombining our two results, $t(\\mathbf{0}, X) \\le \\mathfrak{c}$ and $t(\\mathbf{0}, X) \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$, we conclude that $t(\\mathbf{0}, X) = \\mathfrak{c}$.
