For $\\mathbb{Q}$, the completion is $\\mathbb{R}$. For $(0,1)$, the completion is $[0,1]$. So, a sequence of rationals is Cauchy if it converges to a real number. A sequence in $(0,1)$ is Cauchy if it converges to a number in $[0,1]$.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**Option A:** The sequence is $z_n = (s_n, \\frac{1}{n+1})$.\nThe first component sequence $(s_n)$ is generated by Newton's method for finding a root of $f(x)=x^2-2$, which is $\\sqrt{2}$. Starting with a rational number $s_1=1$, all subsequent terms $s_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(s_k + \\frac{2}{s_k})$ are also rational. This sequence is known to converge to $\\sqrt{2}$. Since it converges in $\\mathbb{R}$, $(s_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence. However, its limit $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, so $(s_n)$ does not converge in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe second component sequence is $x_n = \\frac{1}{n+1}$. For $n \\ge 1$, all terms are in $(0, 1/2] \\subset (0,1)$. This sequence converges to $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Since it converges in $\\mathbb{R}$, it is a Cauchy sequence. The limit is $0$, which is not in the open interval $(0,1)$, so $(x_n)$ does not converge in $(0,1)$.\nSince both component sequences are Cauchy, $z_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. The limit point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$ and $0 \\notin (0,1)$, the limit point is not in $X$. Thus, $z_n$ is a Cauchy sequence that does not converge in $X$. Option A is correct.\n\n**Option B:** The sequence is $z_n = (1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2(n+1)})$.\nThe first component is $q_n = 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}$. This is a sequence of rational numbers. It converges to $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}) = 1$. Since $1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, this sequence converges in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe second component is $x_n = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2(n+1)}$. For $n\\ge 1$, all terms are in $(1/2, 3/4] \\subset (0,1)$. It converges to $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2(n+1)}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\frac{1}{2} \\in (0,1)$, this sequence converges in $(0,1)$.\nSince both component sequences converge to points within their respective spaces, the sequence $z_n$ converges to the point $(1, 1/2)$, which is in $X$. Therefore, this is a convergent Cauchy sequence. Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** The sequence is $z_n = (\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{k!}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nThe first component is $q_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{k!}$. These are the partial sums of the series for $e$. Each $q_n$ is a finite sum of rationals, hence rational. The sequence converges to Euler's number, $e \\approx 2.718...$. Since it converges in $\\mathbb{R}$, it is a Cauchy sequence. The limit $e$ is irrational, so $(q_n)$ does not converge in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe second component is the constant sequence $x_n = 1/2$. A constant sequence is always Cauchy and converges to that constant value, $1/2$. Since $1/2 \\in (0,1)$, this sequence converges in $(0,1)$.\nBoth components are Cauchy, so $z_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. The limit point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $(e, 1/2)$. Since $e \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, the limit point is not in $X$. Thus, $z_n$ is a non-convergent Cauchy sequence in $X$. Option C is correct.\n\n**Option D:** The sequence is $z_n = (\\frac{1}{n+1}, 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1})$.\nThe first component is $q_n = \\frac{1}{n+1}$. This is a sequence of rational numbers converging to $0$. Since $0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, this sequence converges in $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is a Cauchy sequence.\nThe second component is $x_n = 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}$. For $n \\ge 1$, all terms are in $[1/2, 1) \\subset (0,1)$. This sequence converges to $1$. Since it converges in $\\mathbb{R}$, it is a Cauchy sequence. The limit $1$ is not in the open interval $(0,1)$, so $(x_n)$ does not converge in $(0,1)$.\nBoth components are Cauchy, so $z_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. The limit point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $(0, 1)$. Since $1 \\notin (0,1)$, the limit point is not in $X$. Thus, $z_n$ is a non-convergent Cauchy sequence in $X$. Option D is correct.\n\n**Option E:** The sequence is $z_n = (n, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nThe first component is $q_n = n$. This sequence diverges to infinity. It is not a Cauchy sequence because for any $n$, the distance between consecutive terms is $|q_{n+1} - q_n| = |n+1 - n| = 1$, which does not approach zero.\nSince the first component sequence is not Cauchy, the sequence $z_n$ is not a Cauchy sequence in $X$. Option E is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the sequences in options A, C, and D are all Cauchy sequences in $X$ that do not converge to a point within $X$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "1540841"}, {"introduction": "Is the completion of a space determined solely by its topology?
