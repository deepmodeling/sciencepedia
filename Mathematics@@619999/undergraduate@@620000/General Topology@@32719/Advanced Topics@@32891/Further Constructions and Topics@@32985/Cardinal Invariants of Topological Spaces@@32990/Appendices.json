Its basis consists of all rectangles of the form $[a, b) \\times [c, d)$.", "solution": "We analyze each option against the three requirements: separable, countable cellularity, and uncountable weight.\n\nFor A (the real line with the Euclidean topology): It is separable because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense. Its cellularity is countable: any family of pairwise disjoint nonempty open intervals $\\{(a_{i},b_{i})\\}$ is countable since we can inject it into $\\mathbb{Q}$ by choosing a distinct rational in each interval. Its weight is countable because the family $\\{(a,b): a,b\\in \\mathbb{Q}, a<b\\}$ is a countable base, so $w(\\mathbb{R}) \\le \\aleph_{0}$. Therefore A fails the “uncountable weight” requirement.\n\nFor B (the Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$):\n- Separability: $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$, since every nonempty basic open set $[a,b)$ contains a rational number. Hence $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$ is separable.\n- Countable cellularity: Let $\\mathcal{U}$ be any family of pairwise disjoint nonempty open sets in $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$. For each $U\\in \\mathcal{U}$ pick a basic $[a_{U},b_{U})\\subseteq U$. Choose $q_{U}\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\cap (a_{U},b_{U})$. If $U\\neq V$, then $[a_{U},b_{U})\\cap [a_{V},b_{V})=\\emptyset$ as subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$, so $q_{U}\\neq q_{V}$. Thus $U\\mapsto q_{U}$ injects $\\mathcal{U}$ into $\\mathbb{Q}$, yielding $|\\mathcal{U}|\\le \\aleph_{0}$. Since there is an infinite pairwise disjoint family (e.g., $\\{[n,n+1):n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$), we get $c(\\mathbb{R}_{S})=\\aleph_{0}$.\n- Uncountable weight: Suppose $B$ is a base for $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$. For each $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, because $[x,x+1)$ is open and $B$ is a base, there exists $B_{x}\\in B$ with $x\\in B_{x}\\subseteq [x,x+1)$. Any basic open set in $\\mathbb{R}_{S}$ is of the form $[a,b)$. If $x\\in [a,b)\\subseteq [x,x+1)$, then $a\\le x$ and $a\\ge x$, so $a=x$. Hence $B_{x}=[x,b_{x})$ for some $b_{x}\\le x+1$. If $x\\neq y$, then $B_{x}\\neq B_{y}$ because their left endpoints differ. Therefore the map $x\\mapsto B_{x}$ is injective from $\\mathbb{R}$ into $B$, so $|B|\\ge |\\mathbb{R}|=2^{\\aleph_{0}}$. Hence $w(\\mathbb{R}_{S})\\ge 2^{\\aleph_{0}}$, in particular uncountable. Thus B satisfies all three properties.\n\nFor C (an uncountable discrete space): It is not separable because any dense subset must equal the whole space, which is uncountable. Its cellularity is uncountable since the family of all singletons is a pairwise disjoint family of nonempty open sets of cardinality $|X|$. Hence C fails the first two requirements.\n\nFor D (the Sorgenfrey plane $\\mathbb{R}_{S}\\times \\mathbb{R}_{S}$): It is a standard fact that the Sorgenfrey plane is not separable (it is a classical counterexample showing that a product of separable spaces need not be separable). Therefore D fails the separability requirement.\n\nConclusion: Only B is separable, has countable cellularity, and has uncountable weight.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1533529"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice ventures into more advanced territory to test the robustness of our understanding.
