The space $(C([a, b]), d_{\\infty})$ is a complete metric space for any closed interval $[a, b]$. Therefore, to determine if the sequence $(f_n)$ is Cauchy, we can investigate whether it is convergent in this space.\n\nFirst, let's find the pointwise limit of the sequence $(f_n)$ on the interval $[0, 1/2]$.
