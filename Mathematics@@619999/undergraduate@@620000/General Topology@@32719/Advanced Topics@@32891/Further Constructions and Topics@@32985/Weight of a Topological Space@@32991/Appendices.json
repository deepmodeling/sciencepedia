The weight $w(X)$ is the minimum possible cardinality of such a base.\n\nHere $X=\\{p,q\\}$ and $\\mathcal{T}=\\{\\emptyset,\\{p\\},X\\}$. We first show a lower bound. Consider the open set $X$. For the point $q \\in X$, the base axiom requires some $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $q \\in B \\subseteq X$. The only open set containing $q$ is $X$ itself, so necessarily $X \\in \\mathcal{B}$. Next, consider the open set $\\{p\\}$. For $p \\in \\{p\\}$, we need some $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $p \\in B \\subseteq \\{p\\}$.
