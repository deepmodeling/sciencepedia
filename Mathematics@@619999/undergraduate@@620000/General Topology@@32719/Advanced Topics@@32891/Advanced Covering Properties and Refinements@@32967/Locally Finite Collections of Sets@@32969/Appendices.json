We apply this definition to each collection in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with its standard topology.\n\nFirst, consider $\\mathcal{A} = \\{U_{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ with $U_{n} = (n, n+1) \\times (n, n+1)$. Fix any point $p = (x_{0}, y_{0}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and consider the following exhaustive cases.\n1) If there exists $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $x_{0}, y_{0} \\in (n, n+1)$, set \n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\min\\{x_{0} - n, n+1 - x_{0}, y_{0} - n, n+1 - y_{0}\\}  0.\n$$\nThen the open ball $B(p, \\varepsilon)$ is contained in $U_{n}$, so it intersects exactly one set of $\\mathcal{A}$.\n2) If $\\lfloor x_{0} \\rfloor \\neq \\lfloor y_{0} \\rfloor$, let $k = \\lfloor x_{0} \\rfloor$ and $\\ell = \\lfloor y_{0} \\rfloor$ with $k \\neq \\ell$.

Hence $B(p, \\varepsilon)$ is disjoint from every $U_{n}$, and the intersection with $\\mathcal{A}$ is empty.\n3) If one or both coordinates are integers:\n(a) If $x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $y_{0} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$, let $\\ell = \\lfloor y_{0} \\rfloor$ and choose \n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\min\\{y_{0} - \\ell, \\ell+1 - y_{0}\\}  0.\n$$\nThen all points of $B(p, \\varepsilon)$ have $y \\in (\\ell, \\ell+1)$, and a point can lie in some $U_{n}$ only if $n = \\ell$, which forces $x \\in (\\ell, \\ell+1)$. Since $x_{0}$ is an integer, choosing $\\varepsilon$ small ensures that at most one of the half-sides of $B(p, \\varepsilon)$ meets $(\\ell, \\ell+1)$ in the $x$-coordinate, so $B(p, \\varepsilon)$ can intersect at most one set $U_{\\ell}$.\n(b) If both $x_{0}$ and $y_{0}$ are integers, say $x_{0} = y_{0} = m$, choose $\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1/2)$. If $(x, y) \\in B(p, \\varepsilon)$ belongs to some $U_{n}$, then $x, y \\in (n, n+1)$ and also $x, y \\in (m - \\varepsilon, m + \\varepsilon) \\subset (m - 1/2, m + 1/2)$.

We show $\\mathcal{B}$ is not locally finite by exhibiting a point where local finiteness fails. Let $p = (0, y_0)$ be any point on the $y$-axis. Let $W$ be any open neighborhood of $p$. Since $W$ is open, it contains an open ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. There are infinitely many integers $n$ that satisfy both $1/n  \\epsilon$ and $n > |y_0| + \\epsilon$. For each such $n$, consider the point $q_n = (1/(2n), y_0)$. The point $q_n$ lies in $V_n$ since $0  1/(2n)  1/n$ and $|y_0|  n$. The distance between $p$ and $q_n$ is $1/(2n)$, which is less than $\\epsilon$. Thus, $q_n \\in B(p, \\epsilon) \\subseteq W$. This shows that $W$ has a non-empty intersection with $V_n$. Since this is true for infinitely many $n$, every neighborhood of $p$ intersects infinitely many sets from $\\mathcal{B}$.
