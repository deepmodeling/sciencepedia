It begins by stating that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a **paracompact** space. By definition, a space is paracompact if every open cover has a locally finite open refinement.

In Method 1, local finiteness is guaranteed by applying the Heine-Borel theorem to a sequence of compact sets covering the space, while in Method 2, local finiteness is an immediate consequence of Urysohn's Lemma.\n\nB. Local finiteness is achieved in both methods by ensuring each function in the partition has compact support, as any collection of functions with compact support on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is automatically locally finite.\n\nC. Method 1 explicitly utilizes the $\\sigma$-compactness of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (its ability to be written as a countable union of compact sets) to construct a locally finite refinement piece by piece. In contrast, Method 2 relies on the general definition of a paracompact space, which asserts the existence of such a refinement for any open cover without detailing a specific construction based on countability.\n\nD. The distinction is superficial because $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a Lindelöf space, meaning any open cover has a countable subcover. Therefore, Method 2 can always be simplified to Method 1, and the construction using a tower of compact sets is the universal basis for local finiteness on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nE. Both methods fundamentally depend on the normality of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

Incorrect. In Method 1 the finiteness per layer comes from compactness (one may cite the finite subcover property), but in Method 2 local finiteness is not a consequence of Urysohn’s Lemma; it follows from paracompactness. Urysohn’s Lemma is used after obtaining a locally finite refinement to construct the partition functions.\n\nB. Incorrect. Having compact supports does not ensure local finiteness.
