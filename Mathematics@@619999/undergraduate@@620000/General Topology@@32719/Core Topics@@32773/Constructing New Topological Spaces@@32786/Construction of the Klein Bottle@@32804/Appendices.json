This first exercise invites you to do just that by examining how a simple horizontal line within the original square transforms under the quotient map.

This image can be viewed as the path traced by $\\pi(x,c)$ as $x$ varies from $0$ to $1$.\n\nA path forms a closed loop if its starting point coincides with its ending point in the quotient space.\nThe path in the square, parametrized by $x \\in [0,1]$, starts at the point $P_{start} = (0,c)$ and ends at the point $P_{end} = (1,c)$.\nIn the quotient space, the starting point is the equivalence class $\\pi(P_{start}) = \\pi(0,c)$ and the ending point is the equivalence class $\\pi(P_{end}) = \\pi(1,c)$.\n\nFor $\\pi(L_c)$ to be a closed loop, we must have $\\pi(0,c) = \\pi(1,c)$, which means the points $(0,c)$ and $(1,c)$ must be equivalent under the relation $\\sim$. So we need to find when $(0,c) \\sim (1,c)$.\n\nLet's examine the identification rules.\nRule 1, $(x,0) \\sim (x,1)$, does not apply because we are given that $c \\in (0,1)$, so $c \\ne 0$ and $c \\ne 1$.\nRule 2, $(0,y) \\sim (1, 1-y)$, applies to the starting point $(0,c)$. Setting $y=c$ in this rule, we find the identification for our starting point:\n$$ (0,c) \\sim (1, 1-c) $$\nThis means the point on the left edge at height $c$ is identified with the point on the right edge at height $1-c$.\n\nWe require the start and end points of our path to be identified, i.e., $(0,c) \\sim (1,c)$.\nFrom the identification rule, we know that $(0,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$.\nBy transitivity of the equivalence relation, if $(0,c) \\sim (1,c)$ and $(0,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$, then it must be that $(1,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$.\n\nThe equivalence relation $\\sim$ only identifies points on the boundary of the square $S$. Two distinct points in the interior of the same edge, such as $(1,y_1)$ and $(1,y_2)$ with $y_1 \\ne y_2$, are not identified. Therefore, the condition $(1,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$ can only be satisfied if the two points are identical.\nThis implies their y-coordinates must be equal:\n$$ c = 1-c $$\nSolving this equation for $c$:\n$$ 2c = 1 $$\n$$ c = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThus, the horizontal line segment forms a closed loop only when it is at height $c = 1/2$.\n\nFor the loop to be simple, no other points on the segment may be identified. An interior point of the segment is of the form $(x,c)$ with $0 < x < 1$. Such a point is in the interior of the square $S$, where no identifications occur. Therefore, it is not identified with any other point on the segment. This confirms that for $c=1/2$, the resulting closed loop is simple.

Hence these subsets are not open in $I^{2}$.\n- The point $(1,0)$ is included because it is equivalent to $(0,0)\\in U$, but no neighborhood of $(1,0)$ lies in $p^{-1}(p(U))$, since no other points near $(1,0)$ are equivalent to any point of $U$ except the corner itself. Thus $(1,0)$ appears as an isolated point of $p^{-1}(p(U))$, which also prevents $p^{-1}(p(U))$ from being open in $I^{2}$.\n\nConsequently $p^{-1}(p(U))$ is not open in $I^{2}$, and by the definition of the quotient topology $p(U)$ is not open in $K$.\n\nIt follows that for every neighborhood $U$ of $v_{c}$, the set $p(U)$ fails to be an open neighborhood of $[v]=p(v_{c})$ in $K$.
