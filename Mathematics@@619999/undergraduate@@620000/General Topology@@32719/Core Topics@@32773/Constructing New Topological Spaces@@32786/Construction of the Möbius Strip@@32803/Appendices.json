For instance, the interval $[0, 1]$ representing the vertical direction on an edge can be mapped to itself (identity, preserving orientation) or to $[1, 0]$ (reversing orientation).\n\nLet's analyze the effect of $n$ half-twists on the identification of a point $(0, y)$ on the left edge.\n- **Zero half-twists ($n=0$):** This is a simple gluing without any twist. The point $(0, y)$ is identified with the point $(1, y)$ at the same height. The identification is $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$. This construction results in a cylinder, which is homeomorphic to an annulus.\n\n- **One half-twist ($n=1$):** The edge is given a 180-degree twist before gluing. This means the top of the left edge is connected to the bottom of the right edge, and vice-versa. The point $(0, y)$ is identified with $(1, 1-y)$. This is the standard construction of the Möbius strip.\n\n- **Two half-twists ($n=2$):** This corresponds to a full 360-degree rotation. The orientation of the edge is restored to its original state. The point $(0, y)$ is again identified with $(1, y)$. The resulting space is a cylinder (annulus), although its embedding in 3D space would have a full twist in it. Topologically, it is the same as the space with zero twists.\n\n- **Three half-twists ($n=3$):** This corresponds to a rotation of 540 degrees. A 360-degree rotation returns the edge to its original orientation, and the remaining 180-degree rotation reverses it. Thus, the net effect is the same as a single 180-degree (one half-twist) rotation. The identification rule is $(0, y) \\sim (1, 1-y)$.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can generalize. The identification rule depends on the parity of the number of half-twists, $n$.\n- If $n$ is even ($n = 2k$), the identification is $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$, resulting in a space homeomorphic to an annulus.\n- If $n$ is odd ($n = 2k+1$), the identification is $(0, y) \\sim (1, 1-y)$, resulting in a space homeomorphic to the Möbius strip.\n\nIn the problem, we are given three half-twists. Since 3 is an odd number, the equivalence relation is generated by the identification $(0, y) \\sim (1, 1-y)$ for all $y \\in [0, 1]$.

Let the strip be represented by the unit square $X = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The standard Möbius strip is constructed by identifying the left edge with the right edge after one half-twist, which corresponds to the equivalence relation $(0, y) \\sim (1, 1-y)$ for all $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nConsider a different construction where the identification of the left edge $(\\{0\\} \\times [0, 1])$ and the right edge $(\\{1\\} \\times [0, 1])$ is performed after applying two consecutive half-twists (i.e., a full $360^\\circ$ rotation) to one of the edges.

A single half-twist corresponds to a rotation of $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$). Therefore, two consecutive half-twists correspond to a rotation of $2\\pi$ radians ($360^\\circ$). A rotation of $2\\pi$ is the identity transformation, meaning the edge is brought back to its original orientation before gluing.\n\nThe problem statement formalizes this identification with the equivalence relation $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$ for all $y \\in [0, 1]$. We need to determine the properties of the quotient space $S = X/\\sim$.\n\nLet's first visualize the gluing process. We are taking a rectangular strip and gluing the left edge to the right edge straight across, without any twisting. This process creates a cylinder, which is topologically equivalent to an annulus. We can formalize this by showing $S$ is homeomorphic to $S^1 \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the properties of this space to evaluate the given options. The two key properties are orientability and the number of boundary components.\n\n**1. Boundary Components:**\nThe boundary of the original square $X$, denoted $\\partial X$, consists of four segments:\n1. The left edge: $L = \\{0\\} \\times [0, 1]$\n2. The right edge: $R = \\{1\\} \\times [0, 1]$\n3. The bottom edge: $B = [0, 1] \\times \\{0\\}$\n4. The top edge: $T = [0, 1] \\times \\{1\\}$\n\nThe equivalence relation $\\sim$ identifies the left edge $L$ with the right edge $R$. In the quotient space $S$, these two segments become one and are no longer part of the boundary. The boundary of the quotient space, $\\partial S$, is formed by the parts of $\\partial X$ that were not identified with anything. These are the bottom edge $B$ and the top edge $T$.\n\nLet's examine the bottom edge $B$ in the quotient space. In $X$, its endpoints are $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$. Due to the identification $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$, the point $(0, 0)$ is identified with $(1, 0)$. This means that in $S$, the bottom edge forms a closed loop, which is a circle (homeomorphic to $S^1$).\n\nSimilarly, let's examine the top edge $T$. Its endpoints are $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 1)$. The identification glues $(0, 1)$ to $(1, 1)$, so the top edge also forms a closed loop in $S$.\n\nThus, the boundary of $S$ consists of two distinct, disjoint closed loops. Therefore, $S$ has two boundary components.\n\n**2. Orientability:**\nA surface is orientable if one can define a consistent notion of \"clockwise\" or \"counter-clockwise\" on a small loop and transport it anywhere on the surface without its orientation being reversed. The space $S$ is a cylinder. We can place a small oriented loop on its surface. If we slide this loop all the way around the axis of the cylinder and back to its starting point, the orientation (e.g., clockwise) remains unchanged. This is a key characteristic of an orientable surface. For contrast, performing the same action on a Möbius strip (which involves one half-twist) would reverse the orientation of the loop.\n\nMore formally, a surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is orientable if we can define a continuous non-zero normal vector field on it. A cylinder admits such a field (e.g., the outward-pointing radial vectors). Therefore, the space $S$ is orientable.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options:**\nBased on our analysis, the space $S$ is orientable and has two boundary components. Let's check the given options:\n\nA. $S$ is non-orientable and has one boundary component. This describes the Möbius strip. Incorrect.\nB. $S$ is homeomorphic to a Klein bottle, which is a closed, non-orientable surface. A closed surface has no boundary. Our space $S$ has two boundary components, so this is incorrect.\nC. $S$ is orientable and has one boundary component. Our space $S$ has two boundary components. Incorrect.\nD. $S$ is orientable and has two boundary components. This matches our findings. Correct.\nE. $S$ is non-orientable and has two boundary components. Our space $S$ is orientable.
