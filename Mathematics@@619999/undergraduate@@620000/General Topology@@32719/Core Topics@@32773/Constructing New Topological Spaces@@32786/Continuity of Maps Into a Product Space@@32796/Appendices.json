The function $g$ is not continuous at any non-zero irrational point.\n\nTherefore, the function $g(x)$ is continuous only at $x_{0}=0$.\nSince $f$ is continuous if and only if both its components are continuous, and $f_1(x)=x^2$ is continuous everywhere, $f$ is continuous only at the points where $g(x)$ is continuous.
