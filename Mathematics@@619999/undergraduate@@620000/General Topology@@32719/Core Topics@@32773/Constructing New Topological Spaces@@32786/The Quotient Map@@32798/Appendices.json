Let $q:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to X=\\mathbb{R}^{2}/\\sim$ be the quotient map. Since $f$ is constant on equivalence classes, there is a unique map $h:X\\to[0,\\infty)$ such that $h\\circ q=f$, explicitly $h([p])=f(p)$. This $h$ is bijective: surjectivity follows from the surjectivity of $f$, and injectivity follows because $h([p_{1}])=h([p_{2}])$ implies $f(p_{1})=f(p_{2})$, hence $p_{1}\\sim p_{2}$, so $[p_{1}]=[p_{2}]$.\n\nTo show $h$ is a homeomorphism, it suffices to show $f$ is a quotient map.
