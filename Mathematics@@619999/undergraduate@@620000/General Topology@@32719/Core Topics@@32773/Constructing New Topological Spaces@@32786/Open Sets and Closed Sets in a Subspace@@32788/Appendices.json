In our case, the set $A$ is the open ball $B_Y(y_0, r)$.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. $X = \\mathbb{R}^2$, $Y = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 < 1\\} \\cup \\{(2, 0)\\}$, with $y_0 = (0,0)$ and $r=2$.**\n\nFirst, let's determine the open ball in $Y$, $B_Y(y_0, r)$:\n$B_Y((0,0), 2) = \\{y \\in Y \\mid d((0,0), y) < 2\\}$.\nThe subspace $Y$ consists of the open unit disk and the point $(2,0)$.\n- For any point $y$ in the open unit disk, its distance to the origin is $d((0,0), y) < 1$, which is less than 2. So all points in the open unit disk are in $B_Y((0,0), 2)$.\n- For the point $(2,0)$, its distance to the origin is $d((0,0), (2,0)) = \\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = 2$. This is not strictly less than 2. So, $(2,0) \\notin B_Y((0,0), 2)$.\nThus, the open ball is precisely the open unit disk: $B_Y((0,0), 2) = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 < 1\\}$.\n\nNext, we find the closure of this ball in $Y$, $\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)}$. We use the formula $\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)}^Y = \\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)}^{X} \\cap Y$.\n- The closure in $X = \\mathbb{R}^2$ of the open unit disk is the closed unit disk: $\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)}^{X} = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\le 1\\}$.\n- Now, we intersect this with $Y$:\n$\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)} = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\le 1\\} \\cap (\\{(x', y') \\mid (x')^2 + (y')^2 < 1\\} \\cup \\{(2, 0)\\})$.\nThe intersection does not include the point $(2,0)$ as it is not in the closed unit disk. It also does not include the boundary of the unit disk (where $x^2+y^2=1$) because those points are not in $Y$. The result of the intersection is just the open unit disk.\nSo, $\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)} = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 < 1\\}$.\n\nFinally, we find the closed ball in $Y$, $C_Y(y_0, r)$:\n$C_Y((0,0), 2) = \\{y \\in Y \\mid d((0,0), y) \\le 2\\}$.\n- All points in the open unit disk part of $Y$ have a distance less than 1 from the origin, so they are included.\n- The point $(2,0) \\in Y$ has distance exactly 2 from the origin, so it is also included.\nSo, $C_Y((0,0), 2) = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 < 1\\} \\cup \\{(2, 0)\\}$.\n\nComparing the closure and the closed ball, we see that $\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)} = \\{(x, y) \\mid x^2+y^2 < 1\\}$ and $C_Y((0,0), 2) = \\{(x, y) \\mid x^2+y^2 < 1\\} \\cup \\{(2,0)\\}$. Since the point $(2,0)$ is in $C_Y((0,0), 2)$ but not in $\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)}$, we have $\\overline{B_Y((0,0), 2)} \\subsetneq C_Y((0,0), 2)$.

This option does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**C. $X = \\mathbb{R}$, $Y = \\mathbb{Z}$, with $y_0 = 0$ and $r=0.5$.**\nFirst, the open ball: $B_Y(0, 0.5) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid |z - 0| < 0.5\\}$. The only integer satisfying this is $0$. So, $B_Y(0, 0.5) = \\{0\\}$.\nNext, the closure: The set $\\{0\\}$ is a singleton. In any metric space, a finite set of points is closed. Therefore, the closure of $\\{0\\}$ in $Y$ is just $\\{0\\}$. $\\overline{B_Y(0, 0.5)} = \\{0\\}$.\nFinally, the closed ball: $C_Y(0, 0.5) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid |z - 0| \\le 0.5\\}$. The only integer satisfying this is also $0$. So, $C_Y(0, 0.5) = \\{0\\}$.\nHere, $\\overline{B_Y(0, 0.5)} = C_Y(0, 0.5)$.

The set of points $\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d((1,0), y) < 1\\}$ is an open ball centered at $(1,0)$ with radius 1. Any point $y$ in this ball is at a distance of less than 1 from $(1,0)$. By the triangle inequality, its distance from the origin is $d((0,0), y) \\le d((0,0), (1,0)) + d((1,0), y) < 1 + 1 = 2$. Thus, every point in this open ball is strictly inside the disk of radius 2, meaning it is in $Y$. So, $B_Y((1,0), 1) = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d((1,0), y) < 1\\}$.\nThe closure in $Y$: $\\overline{B_Y((1,0), 1)}^Y = \\overline{\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d((1,0), y) < 1\\}}^{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\cap Y = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d((1,0), y) \\le 1\\} \\cap Y$. The closed ball $\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d((1,0), y) \\le 1\\}$ is also entirely contained within $Y$ (its furthest point from the origin is $(2,0)$, which is on the boundary of $Y$). Thus, the intersection is the closed ball itself: $\\overline{B_Y((1,0), 1)} = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d((1,0), y) \\le 1\\}$.\nThe closed ball in $Y$: $C_Y((1,0), 1) = \\{y \\in Y \\mid d((1,0), y) \\le 1\\}$. Since the closed ball $\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d((1,0), y) \\le 1\\}$ is contained in $Y$, this is identical to $\\overline{B_Y((1,0), 1)}$.\nHere, $\\overline{B_Y((1,0), 1)} = C_Y((1,0), 1)$.
