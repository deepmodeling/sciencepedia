Two spaces are homeomorphic if there exists a continuous bijection between them with a continuous inverse. If we can find a topological property that one space possesses and the other does not, we can conclude they are not homeomorphic. We will examine the properties mentioned in the options.\n\nFirst, let's establish the basis for each topology on $\\mathbb{Q}^\\omega$.\n-   A basis for $\\mathcal{T}_p$ consists of sets of the form $\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty V_n$ where each $V_n$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{Q}$ (with its usual topology as a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}$) and $V_n = \\mathbb{Q}$ for all but finitely many $n$.\n-   A basis for $\\mathcal{T}_b$ consists of sets of the form $\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty V_n$ where each $V_n$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Note that the topology on $\\mathbb{Q}^\\omega$ with this basis is precisely the box topology on the product of copies of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet's analyze statement B concerning separability. A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset.\n\n**Separability of $X_p = (\\mathbb{Q}^\\omega, \\mathcal{T}_p)$:**\nLet $D$ be the set of all sequences of rational numbers that are eventually zero. That is,\n$$ D = \\{ (q_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\in \\mathbb{Q}^\\omega \\mid \\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ such that } q_n = 0 \\text{ for all } n > N \\} $$\nThis set can be written as a countable union of countable sets: $D = \\bigcup_{N=1}^\\infty (\\mathbb{Q}^N \\times \\{0\\} \\times \\{0\\} \\times \\dots)$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}^N$ is countable for each $N$, $D$ is a countable set.\nTo show $D$ is dense in $X_p$, we must show that any non-empty basic open set in $X_p$ intersects $D$. Let $U = \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty V_n$ be a basic open set, where $V_n$ is open in $\\mathbb{Q}$ for all $n$, and there is a finite set of indices $F$ such that $V_n = \\mathbb{Q}$ for all $n \\notin F$. Since $U$ is non-empty, each $V_n$ is non-empty. We can construct a point $\\mathbf{d} = (d_n) \\in D \\cap U$. For each $n \\in F$, pick an arbitrary rational number $d_n \\in V_n$. For $n \\notin F$, set $d_n = 0$. The resulting sequence $\\mathbf{d}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}^\\omega$. It belongs to $D$ because it is zero for all $n$ not in the finite set $F$ (or more precisely, for all $n > \\max(F)$ if $F$ is not empty). It also belongs to $U$ because for $n \\in F$, $d_n \\in V_n$, and for $n \\notin F$, $d_n = 0 \\in \\mathbb{Q} = V_n$.\nThus, $D$ is a countable dense subset of $X_p$, so $X_p$ is separable.\n\n**Separability of $X_b = (\\mathbb{Q}^\\omega, \\mathcal{T}_b)$:**\nWe will show that $X_b$ is not separable. Let $D = \\{ \\mathbf{d}_k \\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ be any countable subset of $X_b$, where $\\mathbf{d}_k = (d_{k,1}, d_{k,2}, d_{k,3}, \\dots)$ is a sequence of rational numbers. We will construct a non-empty open set in $X_b$ that is disjoint from $D$, using a diagonalization argument.\nFor each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, consider the $k$-th coordinate of the $k$-th sequence in $D$, which is $d_{k,k}$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a singleton set, we can choose a rational number $q_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $q_k \\neq d_{k,k}$.\nNow, for each $k$, we define an open set $V_k$ in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $V_k = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid |q - q_k| < \\frac{1}{2} |q_k - d_{k,k}| \\}$. This is a non-empty open set in $\\mathbb{Q}$ that contains $q_k$ but does not contain $d_{k,k}$.\nConsider the set $V = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty V_k$. This is a non-empty basic open set in the box topology $\\mathcal{T}_b$. For any sequence $\\mathbf{d}_k \\in D$, its $k$-th coordinate is $d_{k,k}$. By our construction of $V_k$, we have $d_{k,k} \\notin V_k$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{d}_k \\notin V$. This holds for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nSo we have found a non-empty open set $V$ such that $V \\cap D = \\emptyset$. This means $D$ cannot be dense in $X_b$. Since $D$ was an arbitrary countable subset, $X_b$ has no countable dense subset and is therefore not separable.\n\nSince separability is a topological property, and $X_p$ is separable while $X_b$ is not, they cannot be homeomorphic. Thus, statement B is a valid reason.\n\nNow let's analyze statement D concerning first-countability. A space is first-countable if every point has a countable local basis.\n\n**First-countability of $X_p = (\\mathbb{Q}^\\omega, \\mathcal{T}_p)$:**\nThe space $(\\mathbb{R}^\\omega, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{prod}})$ is a countable product of first-countable spaces ($\\mathbb{R}$), and is therefore first-countable. A subspace of a first-countable space is always first-countable. Thus, $X_p$ is first-countable.\nExplicitly, for any point $\\mathbf{x}=(x_n) \\in X_p$, the collection of sets\n$$ B_{k,m} = \\left\\{ (y_n) \\in \\mathbb{Q}^\\omega \\;\\middle|\\; |y_n - x_n| < \\frac{1}{m} \\text{ for } n=1, \\dots, k \\right\\} $$\nfor all $k,m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ forms a countable local basis at $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\n**First-countability of $X_b = (\\mathbb{Q}^\\omega, \\mathcal{T}_b)$:**\nWe show $X_b$ is not first-countable. Let $\\mathbf{x} = (x_n)$ be an arbitrary point in $X_b$. Let $\\{ B_k \\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ be any countable collection of neighborhoods of $\\mathbf{x}$. We will construct a neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}$ that does not contain any of the $B_k$.\nFor each $k$, since $B_k$ is a neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}$, it contains a basic open set $U_k = \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty U_{k,n}$ containing $\\mathbf{x}$, where each $U_{k,n}$ is an open neighborhood of $x_n$ in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe use a diagonal argument. For each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, consider the open set $U_{k,k}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which contains $x_k$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a discrete space, we can find a smaller open neighborhood $V_k$ of $x_k$ such that $V_k$ is a proper subset of $U_{k,k}$. For example, if $U_{k,k} = (a, b) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$, we can choose $V_k = (\\frac{a+x_k}{2}, \\frac{b+x_k}{2}) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$.\nNow, define a new neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}$ in the box topology as $V = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty V_k$.\nFor any given $k$, is $B_k \\subseteq V$? If this were true, then we would need $U_k \\subseteq V$, which in turn would require $U_{k,n} \\subseteq V_n$ for all $n$. But for the index $n=k$, we have $V_k \\subsetneq U_{k,k}$, so $U_{k,k} \\not\\subseteq V_k$. This implies $U_k \\not\\subseteq V$, and therefore $B_k \\not\\subseteq V$.\nThis shows that our constructed neighborhood $V$ does not contain any set from the collection $\\{B_k\\}$. Thus, no countable collection of neighborhoods can be a local basis at $\\mathbf{x}$. The space $X_b$ is not first-countable.\n\nSince first-countability is a topological property, and $X_p$ is first-countable while $X_b$ is not, they cannot be homeomorphic. Thus, statement D is also a valid reason.\n\nFinally, we analyze statement C about connectedness. The space $\\mathbb{Q}$ with its usual topology is totally disconnected. A product of totally disconnected spaces is totally disconnected, regardless of whether the product or box topology is used. Therefore, both $X_p$ and $X_b$ are totally disconnected. This property does not distinguish between them, so statement C is false.\n\nConclusion:\n- Statement A is false because the spaces are not homeomorphic.\n- Statement B is true.\n- Statement C is false.\n- Statement D is true.\n- Since both B and D provide valid, distinct reasons for the non-homeomorphism of the spaces, statement E is the most complete and accurate choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1539500"}]}
