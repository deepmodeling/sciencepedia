The trigonometric functions $\\cos$ and $\\sin$ are continuous and $2\\pi$-periodic, hence $q$ is continuous and satisfies $q(x+n) = q(x)$ for every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.

Define $s: [0,1] \\to X$ by $s(u) = [u]$. The map $s$ is continuous as the composition of the inclusion $[0,1] \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with $p$, and it is surjective since every class $[x]$ has a representative in $[0,1]$. Since $[0,1]$ is compact and continuous images of compact sets are compact, $X$ is compact. The space $S^{1}$ is Hausdorff as a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism; thus $g$ has a continuous inverse.

The equivalence relation identifies each point on the left edge $\\{0\\}\\times[0,1]$ with the point on the right edge $\\{1\\}\\times[0,1]$ having reversed vertical coordinate, namely $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$. All other points are only equivalent to themselves. Thus the interior points and the points on the top and bottom edges are not identified with other distinct points, except at the endpoints of the vertical edges where the corner points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ are identified, and $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ are identified.\n\nThis quotient can be described as a fiber bundle over $S^{1}$ with fiber $[0,1]$ as follows. Consider the projection $\\pi:X\\to[0,1]$ onto the first coordinate, and then mod out the endpoints using the given identification. Passing to the quotient $Y=X/\\sim$, the first coordinate descends to a continuous surjection $p:Y\\to S^{1}$ by identifying $0$ and $1$, since the quotient relation precisely glues $x=0$ and $x=1$. The fiber over a point in $S^{1}$ corresponding to $x\\in[0,1)$ is naturally homeomorphic to $[0,1]$ via the second coordinate $y$. The monodromy around the base circle is given by the map $[0,1]\\to[0,1]$, $y\\mapsto 1-y$, arising from the identification $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$.\n\nTherefore, $Y$ is the mapping torus of the interval $[0,1]$ with respect to the reflection $r(y)=1-y$. There are exactly two $I$-bundles over $S^{1}$ up to isomorphism: the trivial bundle $S^{1}\\times[0,1]$ (the cylinder), corresponding to the identity monodromy $y\\mapsto y$, and the nontrivial bundle corresponding to the reflection $y\\mapsto 1-y$, which is the Möbius strip. Since our monodromy is $r(y)=1-y$, the resulting space is the Möbius strip.\n\nEquivalently, one can recognize directly that the standard construction of the Möbius strip is obtained from a rectangle by identifying the two vertical edges with reversed orientation, exactly $(0,y)\\sim(1,1-y)$, while leaving the horizontal edges as boundary. That is precisely the identification specified, so $Y$ is homeomorphic to the Möbius strip.\n\nBy contrast:\n- The cylinder $S^{1}\\times[0,1]$ would require $(0,y)\\sim(1,y)$ (orientation-preserving), which is not the case here.\n- The torus $S^{1}\\times S^{1}$ would additionally require identifying the top and bottom edges, which is not done here.\n- The Klein bottle would require identifying one pair of opposite edges with a twist and the other pair without a twist; again, the top and bottom edges are not identified here.\n- The $2$-sphere $S^{2}$ cannot arise from this single-edge identification of a square.\n\nHence the quotient space $Y$ is homeomorphic to the Möbius strip.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1586391"}, {"introduction": "While many quotient constructions yield familiar, \"well-behaved\" spaces, this exercise explores a crucial counterexample.
