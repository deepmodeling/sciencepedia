A set $S$ is considered open in a subspace $Y$ of a topological space $X$ if and only if $S$ can be expressed as the intersection of an open set in $X$ with the subspace $Y$. In our case, $X=\\mathbb{R}$ and $Y = [0, 2] \\cup (3, 5]$. So, a set $S \\subseteq Y$ is open in $Y$ if there exists an open set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ such that $S = U \\cap Y$.\n\nAn equivalent, point-wise definition states that a set $S \\subseteq Y$ is open in $Y$ if for every point $s \\in S$, there exists an open set $U_s$ in the parent space $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $s \\in U_s$ and the intersection $U_s \\cap Y$ is entirely contained within $S$. We will use this point-wise check to determine which of the given sets are not open, and the first definition to confirm which one is open.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. $S_A = [0, 1]$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. To show this, we must find a point in $S_A$ which does not have a \"local neighborhood\" (in $Y$) that is contained within $S_A$. Let's consider the point $s = 1 \\in S_A$. Let $U$ be any open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ that contains $1$. By the definition of an open set in the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}$, $U$ must contain an open interval $(1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon  0$. The intersection of this interval with $Y$ is $(1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon) \\cap ([0, 2] \\cup (3, 5]) = (1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon)$ for any $\\epsilon \\le 1$. The set $U \\cap Y$ therefore contains this interval. For $S_A$ to be open, we would need $U \\cap Y \\subseteq S_A$, which means we would need $(1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon) \\subseteq [0, 1]$. This is false, because the interval $(1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon)$ contains points greater than $1$, such as $1 + \\epsilon/2$. Thus, $S_A$ is not open in $Y$.\n\n**B. $S_B = \\{0, 4\\}$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. Let's consider the point $s = 0 \\in S_B$. Let $U$ be any open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $0$. It must contain an interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon  0$. The intersection of $U$ with $Y$ will therefore contain $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\cap Y = [0, \\epsilon)$. For $S_B$ to be open, this neighborhood $[0, \\epsilon)$ must be a subset of $S_B = \\{0, 4\\}$. This is not true, as $[0, \\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many points other than $0$ and $4$. Thus, $S_B$ is not open in $Y$.\n\n**C. $S_C = [0, 2]$**\nThis set is open in $Y$. To demonstrate this, we need to find an open set $U$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $S_C = U \\cap Y$. Let's choose the open interval $U = (-1, 3)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. The intersection of $U$ with $Y$ is:\n$$U \\cap Y = (-1, 3) \\cap ([0, 2] \\cup (3, 5])$$\nThe numbers in $(-1, 3)$ that are also in $Y$ are precisely those in the interval $[0, 2]$. The interval $(3, 5]$ has no points in common with $(-1, 3)$.\nTherefore, $U \\cap Y = [0, 2] = S_C$.\nSince we have found an open set $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ such that $S_C = U \\cap Y$, the set $S_C$ is, by definition, open in the subspace $Y$.\n\n**D. $S_D = (3, 4]$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. Let's test the endpoint $s = 4 \\in S_D$. Any open set $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ containing $4$ must contain an interval $(4 - \\epsilon, 4 + \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon  0$. The neighborhood of $4$ in $Y$ is $U \\cap Y$, which must contain $(4 - \\epsilon, 4 + \\epsilon) \\cap Y = (4 - \\epsilon, 4 + \\epsilon)$ (for $\\epsilon \\le 1$). For $S_D$ to be open, this neighborhood must be a subset of $S_D=(3, 4]$. This is false because the neighborhood contains points like $4 + \\epsilon/2$, which are not in $S_D$. Thus, $S_D$ is not open in $Y$.\n\n**E. $S_E = \\{5\\}$**\nThis set is not open in $Y$. Let's test the point $s = 5 \\in S_E$. Let $U$ be any open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $5$, for instance, $U = (4.9, 5.1)$. The intersection of $U$ with $Y$ is $U \\cap Y = (4.9, 5.1) \\cap ([0, 2] \\cup (3, 5]) = (4.9, 5]$. For $S_E$ to be open, this resulting set must be a subset of $S_E=\\{5\\}$. This is false, because $(4.9, 5]$ contains infinitely many points. Thus, $S_E$ is not open in $Y$.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only $S_C = [0, 2]$ is an open set in the subspace $Y$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1588212"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify open sets, the next step is to understand the local properties of a subspace, such as the \"interior\" of a set.
