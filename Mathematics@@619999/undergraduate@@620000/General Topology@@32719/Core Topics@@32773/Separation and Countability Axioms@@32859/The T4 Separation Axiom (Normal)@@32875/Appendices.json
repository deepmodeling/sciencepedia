The T4 separation property (also known as normality) for a T1 space requires that for any two disjoint closed sets, there exist disjoint open sets containing them.\n\nTo investigate whether the T4 property is hereditary, we will analyze a specific topological space. Let $S$ be an uncountable set equipped with a total order $≺$ such that for every element $s \\in S$, the set of its predecessors, $\\{x \\in S \\mid x \\prec s\\}$, is a countable set. We can form a new space $S^* = S \\cup \\{p\\}$, where $p$ is a new point not in $S$, by extending the order such that $s \\prec p$ for all $s \\in S$. Let $S^*$ be endowed with the order topology.

The set $B = \\{p\\} \\times [0, 1)$ consists of points whose first coordinate is $p$. By construction, $S$ and $\\{p\\}$ are disjoint sets. Therefore, $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. The sets are disjoint.\n\n**Step 2: Determine if A and B are closed in Y.**\nTo determine if a set is closed in a subspace $Y$, we can find its closure in the parent space $X$ and intersect it with $Y$. A set $C \\subseteq Y$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if $\\overline{C}_X \\cap Y = C$.\n\nLet's analyze set $A = S \\times \\{1\\}$. In the parent space $X = S^* \\times I$, the closure of $A$ is $\\overline{A}_X = \\overline{S \\times \\{1\\}}$. The closure of $S$ in $S^*$ is $S^*$, and the closure of $\\{1\\}$ in $I=[0,1]$ is $\\{1\\}$. Thus, $\\overline{A}_X = \\overline{S} \\times \\overline{\\{1\\}} = S^* \\times \\{1\\}$.\nNow we intersect this with $Y$:\n$\\overline{A}_X \\cap Y = (S^* \\times \\{1\\}) \\cap (X \\setminus \\{(p, 1)\\}) = (S^* \\times \\{1\\}) \\setminus \\{(p, 1)\\} = (S \\cup \\{p\\}) \\times \\{1\\} \\setminus \\{(p, 1)\\} = S \\times \\{1\\} = A$.\nSince $\\overline{A}_X \\cap Y = A$, the set $A$ is closed in $Y$.\n\nNow let's analyze set $B = \\{p\\} \\times [0, 1)$. In the parent space $X$, the closure of $B$ is $\\overline{B}_X = \\overline{\\{p\\} \\times [0, 1)}$. The set $\\{p\\}$ is closed in $S^*$ (since $S^*$ is T1). The closure of $[0, 1)$ in $I=[0,1]$ is $[0, 1]$. Thus, $\\overline{B}_X = \\overline{\\{p\\}} \\times \\overline{[0, 1)} = \\{p\\} \\times [0, 1]$.\nNow we intersect this with $Y$:\n$\\overline{B}_X \\cap Y = (\\{p\\} \\times [0, 1]) \\cap (X \\setminus \\{(p, 1)\\}) = (\\{p\\} \\times [0, 1]) \\setminus \\{(p, 1)\\} = \\{p\\} \\times [0, 1) = B$.\nSince $\\overline{B}_X \\cap Y = B$, the set $B$ is also closed in $Y$.\n\nSo far, we have established that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets in $Y$. This invalidates options A, B, and C. The remaining question is whether they can be separated by disjoint open sets in $Y$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if A and B can be separated by disjoint open sets in Y.**\nLet's assume for the sake of contradiction that $Y$ is a T4 space. Then there exist disjoint open sets $U, V \\subseteq Y$ such that $A \\subseteq U$ and $B \\subseteq V$.\n\nConsider any point $(s, 1)$ in $A$. Since $A \\subseteq U$ and $U$ is open in $Y$, there must exist a basic open neighborhood of $(s, 1)$ that is fully contained in $U$. For a fixed $s \\in S$, the set $\\{s\\} \\times [0, 1]$ is homeomorphic to $[0, 1]$. In this slice, the point $(s, 1)$ is in $U$, so there must be some vertical interval $\\{s\\} \\times (y_s, 1]$ contained in $U$ for some $y_s \\in [0, 1)$. This defines a function $f: S \\to [0, 1)$ where $s \\mapsto y_s$.\n\nNow, let's express the domain $S$ as a countable union of sets: $S = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty S_n$, where $S_n = \\{s \\in S \\mid f(s)  1-1/n\\}$.\nSince $S$ is an uncountable set and it is written as a countable union of the sets $S_n$, at least one of these sets must be uncountable. Let's say $S_N$ is uncountable for some positive integer $N$.\n\nLet $y_0 = 1 - 1/N$. For every $s \\in S_N$, we have $f(s)  y_0$, which means the interval $\\{s\\} \\times (y_0, 1]$ is contained in $U$.\n\nNow turn to the set $B = \\{p\\} \\times [0, 1)$. Consider the point $(p, y_0) \\in B$. Since $B \\subseteq V$ and $V$ is open, there must be a basic open neighborhood of $(p, y_0)$ fully contained in $V$. Neighborhoods of $p$ in the order topology on $S^*$ are of the form $(s_0, p] = \\{x \\in S^* \\mid s_0 \\prec x \\le p\\}$ for some $s_0 \\in S$. So, there exists an $s^* \\in S$ and an open interval $J \\subseteq [0, 1)$ containing $y_0$ such that the basic open set $((s^*, p] \\times J) \\cap Y$ is contained in $V$.\n\nWe have two uncountable sets: $S_N \\subseteq S$ and $(s^*, p] \\cap S \\subseteq S$. The set of predecessors of $s^*$, $\\{s \\in S \\mid s \\preceq s^*\\}$, is countable by the definition of $S$. Since $S_N$ is uncountable, there must be at least one element $s' \\in S_N$ that is not a predecessor of $s^*$. That is, there exists $s' \\in S_N$ such that $s^* \\prec s'$.\n\nLet's examine the consequences for a point $(s', y)$ near $(p, y_0)$.\n1.  Since $s' \\in S_N$, we know that $\\{s'\\} \\times (y_0, 1] \\subseteq U$.\n2.  Since $s^* \\prec s'$, we have $s' \\in (s^*, p]$. This means that for any $y \\in J$, the point $(s', y)$ lies in the set $(s^*, p] \\times J$, which is a subset of $V$.\n\nThe interval $J$ is an open set containing $y_0$, and by definition $y_0  1$. So the intersection $J \\cap (y_0, 1]$ is a non-empty open interval. Let's pick any point $y_{clash}$ from this intersection.\nConsider the point $(s', y_{clash}) \\in Y$.\n- From point 1, since $y_{clash} \\in (y_0, 1]$, we have $(s', y_{clash}) \\in U$.\n- From point 2, since $y_{clash} \\in J$, we have $(s', y_{clash}) \\in V$.\n\nThis implies that $(s', y_{clash}) \\in U \\cap V$. But this contradicts our initial assumption that $U$ and $V$ are disjoint. Therefore, our assumption that such sets $U$ and $V$ exist must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:** The sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint and closed in $Y$, but they cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. This demonstrates that $Y$ is not a T4 (normal) space. The initial space $X$ was T4, and $Y$ is an open subspace of $X$. This entire construction serves as a standard counterexample to show that the T4 property is not hereditary with respect to open subspaces.\n\nThis matches statement E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1589836"}]}
