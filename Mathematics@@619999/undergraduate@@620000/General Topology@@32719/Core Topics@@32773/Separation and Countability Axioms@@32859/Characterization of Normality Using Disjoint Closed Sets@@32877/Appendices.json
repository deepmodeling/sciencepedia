The student correctly observes that the only non-empty closed set is $X$, hence there are no two disjoint non-empty closed sets. They conclude normality by a vacuity argument restricted to non-empty closed sets. This reasoning is incomplete because the definition quantifies over all disjoint closed sets, including cases where one is empty. However, as shown above, the empty-set cases are easily handled, and the space is indeed normal. Therefore, the conclusion is correct though the reasoning is incomplete.\n\nEvaluate Claim 2. The space is not $T_{1}$: for distinct $x,y\\in X$, there is no open set containing $x$ but not $y$ because the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$, and singletons $\\{x\\}$ are not closed when $|X|\\geq 2$.
