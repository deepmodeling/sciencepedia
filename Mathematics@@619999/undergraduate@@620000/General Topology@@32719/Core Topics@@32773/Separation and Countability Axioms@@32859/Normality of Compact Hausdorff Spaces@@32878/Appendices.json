Consider the two disjoint closed subsets $A = \\{0\\}$ and $B = \\{1\\}$.\n\nA fundamental property of metric spaces is that they are normal, meaning any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open sets. A standard method to construct these separating sets involves the distance function.

The space $X$ consists of two separate copies of $[0, 1]$, while $Y$ can be thought of as the interval $(0, 1]$ with two distinct \"origins\" $a$ and $b$. A natural approach is to map the two origins of $X$, which are the points $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 2)$, to the two origins of $Y$, namely $a$ and $b$. To ensure surjectivity, the remainder of both intervals in $X$ must map onto the interval $(0, 1]$ in $Y$.

Then $f(x) = f(y, 1) = y$.\n    - If $y = a$, we can choose $x = (0, 1)$. Then $f(x) = f(0, 1) = a$.\n    - If $y = b$, we can choose $x = (0, 2)$. Then $f(x) = f(0, 2) = b$.\n    Since every point in $Y$ is in the image of $f$, the function is surjective.\n\n2.  **Continuity**: We need to show that the preimage of any open set in $Y$ is open in $X$. It suffices to check this for the basis elements of the topology on $Y$.\n    - Case A: Let $V = (c, d)$ with $0 < c < d \\le 1$.\n      $f^{-1}(V) = \\{(t, k) \\in X : f(t, k) \\in (c, d)\\} = \\{(t, k) \\in X : t \\in (c, d)\\}$.\n      This is the set $(c, d) \\times \\{1\\} \\cup (c, d) \\times \\{2\\}$. Since $(c, d)$ is open in $[0, 1]$, both $(c, d) \\times \\{1\\}$ and $(c, d) \\times \\{2\\}$ are open in their respective component spaces. Their union is thus open in the disjoint union space $X$.\n    - Case B: Let $V = (0, \\epsilon) \\cup \\{a\\}$ for some $0 < \\epsilon \\le 1$.\n      $f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}((0, \\epsilon)) \\cup f^{-1}(\\{a\\})$.\n      $f^{-1}((0, \\epsilon)) = \\{(t, k) \\in X : t \\in (0, \\epsilon)\\} = ((0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup ((0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{2\\})$.\n      $f^{-1}(\\{a\\}) = \\{(0, 1)\\}$.\n      Thus, $f^{-1}(V) = ( [0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\} ) \\cup ( (0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{2\\} )$.\n      The set $[0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\}$ is open in $[0, 1] \\times \\{1\\}$, and $(0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{2\\}$ is open in $[0, 1] \\times \\{2\\}$. Therefore, their union is open in $X$.\n    - Case C: Let $V = (0, \\epsilon) \\cup \\{b\\}$ for some $0 < \\epsilon \\le 1$.\n      By a similar argument, $f^{-1}(V) = ( (0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\} ) \\cup ( [0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{2\\} )$. This is an open set in $X$.\n    Since the preimage of every basis element of $Y$ is open in $X$, the function $f$ is continuous.\n\n3.  **Openness**: We need to show that the image of any open set in $X$ is open in $Y$. It suffices to check this for the basis elements of the topology on $X$. A basis for $X$ is formed by sets of the type $U \\times \\{k\\}$, where $U$ is an open subset of $[0, 1]$ and $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n    - Case A: Let the open set in $X$ be $W = U \\times \\{1\\}$ for some open set $U \\subseteq [0, 1]$.\n        - Subcase A1: If $0 \\notin U$, then $U \\subseteq (0, 1]$. The image is $f(W) = f(U \\times \\{1\\}) = \\{t : t \\in U\\} = U$. Since $U$ is an open subset of $(0, 1]$, it is open in $Y$.\n        - Subcase A2: If $0 \\in U$, then since $U$ is open in $[0, 1]$, there must exist a $\\delta > 0$ such that $[0, \\delta) \\subseteq U$. The image is $f(W) = f((U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup f(\\{(0, 1)\\}) = (U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{a\\}$. To show this set is open in $Y$, consider any point $y$ in it. If $y \\in (U \\setminus \\{0\\})$, it is an interior point because $U \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is an open subset of $(0,1]$. If $y = a$, we know that $[0, \\delta) \\subseteq U$, so the image $f(W)$ contains $(0, \\delta) \\cup \\{a\\}$. This is a basis element in $Y$'s topology and is a neighborhood of $a$. Thus, every point in $f(W)$ has a neighborhood contained within $f(W)$, so $f(W)$ is open.\n    - Case B: Let the open set in $X$ be $W = U \\times \\{2\\}$ for some open set $U \\subseteq [0, 1]$. The argument is identical to Case A.\n        - If $0 \\notin U$, $f(W) = U$, which is open in $Y$.\n        - If $0 \\in U$, $f(W) = (U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{b\\}$. Since $U$ contains some $[0, \\delta)$, $f(W)$ contains the neighborhood $(0, \\delta) \\cup \\{b\\}$ of $b$, making $f(W)$ an open set in $Y$.\n    Since the image of any basis element of $X$ is open in $Y$, the function $f$ is an open map.\n\nThe constructed function $f$ satisfies all three conditions: surjectivity, continuity, and openness.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{f(t, k) = \\begin{cases} t & \\text{if } t \\in (0, 1] \\\\ a & \\text{if } t = 0 \\text{ and } k=1 \\\\ b & \\text{if } t = 0 \\text{ and } k=2 \\end{cases}}\n$$", "id": "1564189"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone application of normality is the construction of continuous functions, with the Tietze Extension Theorem being a powerful tool.
