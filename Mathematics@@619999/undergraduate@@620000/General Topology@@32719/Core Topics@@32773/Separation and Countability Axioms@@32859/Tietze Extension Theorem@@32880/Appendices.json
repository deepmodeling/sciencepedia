Equivalently, $X\\setminus A=(-1,1)=X\\cap(-1,1)$ is open in $X$ because $(-1,1)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $X$ is a metric space (hence normal) and $A$ is closed in $X$, the Tietze Extension Theorem applies to any continuous $f:A\\to\\mathbb{R}$, guaranteeing the existence of a continuous extension $F:X\\to\\mathbb{R}$ with $F|_{A}=f$. In particular, the explicit function $F(x)=-x$ defined on all of $[-1,1]$ is continuous and satisfies $F(-1)=1$ and $F(1)=-1$, so it extends $f$.

Indeed, let $h:X\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be any continuous function and define\n$$\nF_{h}(x)=-x+(1-x^{2})\\,h(x).\n$$\nThen $F_{h}$ is continuous on $X$, and at the endpoints $x=\\pm 1$ we have $1-x^{2}=0$, so $F_{h}(\\pm 1)=-(\\pm 1)=\\mp 1$, which matches $f(\\pm 1)$.

The space $X=[-1,1]$ is connected, and the continuous image of a connected space is connected. The only connected subsets of the discrete set $\\{-1,1\\}$ are singletons, so $G(X)$ would have to be a singleton.

This rules out the possibility posited in statements C and D’s first clause, but we must assess their reasoning about Tietze.\n\nThe Tietze Extension Theorem guarantees an extension to $\\mathbb{R}$ (indeed we exhibited $F(x)=-x$), but it does not assert extensions into arbitrary subspaces such as the disconnected set $\\{-1,1\\}$. Thus the failure of an extension into $\\{-1,1\\}$ is fully consistent with Tietze’s theorem. Statement D captures this correctly. Statement C’s wording that this “demonstrates a case where the Tietze Extension Theorem is not applicable” is misleading in this context: the theorem is applicable to the original problem with codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ and gives a positive result; it simply does not claim anything about extensions into $\\{-1,1\\}$.
