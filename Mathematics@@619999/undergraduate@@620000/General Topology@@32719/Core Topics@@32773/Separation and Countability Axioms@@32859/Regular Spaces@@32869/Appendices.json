Before proceeding, we recall several key definitions from general topology.\n\n- A topological space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is called **regular** if for every closed set $C \\subseteq X$ and any point $p \\in X \\setminus C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U, V \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $p \\in U$ and $C \\subseteq V$.\n- For a topological space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ and a subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the **subspace topology** on $Y$ is the collection of sets $\\mathcal{T}_Y = \\{U \\cap Y \\mid U \\in \\mathcal{T}\\}$. A set $C_Y \\subseteq Y$ is closed in the subspace topology if and only if $C_Y = C \\cap Y$ for some closed set $C$ in $X$.\n- A subspace $Y \\subseteq X$ is **dense** in $X$ if for every non-empty open set $U \\in \\mathcal{T}$, the intersection $U \\cap Y$ is non-empty. This is equivalent to saying the closure of $Y$ in $X$ is $X$ itself.\n\nConsider the set of real numbers, $X = \\mathbb{R}$. We define a specific topology on $X$, known as the K-topology, denoted $\\mathcal{T}_K$. This topology is generated by a basis $\\mathcal{B}$ which consists of all sets of the following two types:\n1. All standard open intervals $(a,b)$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$.\n2. All sets of the form $(a,b) \\setminus K$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$, where $K$ is the set of reciprocals of positive integers, i.e., $K = \\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$.\n\nLet the resulting topological space be denoted $X_K = (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_K)$. Now, consider the subspace $Y \\subset X_K$ consisting of all irrational numbers, equipped with the subspace topology inherited from $X_K$.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the properties of the space $X_K$ and its subspace $Y$?\n\nA. $X_K$ is a regular space, and its subspace $Y$ is also a regular space.\n\nB. $X_K$ is a regular space, but its subspace $Y$ is not a regular space.\n\nC. $X_K$ is not a regular space, but its subspace $Y$ is a regular space.\n\nD. $X_K$ is not a regular space, and its subspace $Y$ is also not a regular space.\n\nE. The subspace $Y$ is not dense in $X_K$.", "solution": "We work in $X_{K}=(\\mathbb{R},\\mathcal{T}_{K})$ where the basis consists of all $(a,b)$ and all $(a,b)\\setminus K$ with $K=\\{1/n\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\}$. Let $Y$ be the set of irrationals with the subspace topology from $X_{K}$.\n\nFirst, we record that $K$ is closed in $X_{K}$. Indeed, $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus K=\\bigcup_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}}((-m,m)\\setminus K)$ is a union of basis elements, hence open, so $K$ is closed.\n\nWe show $X_{K}$ is not regular by attempting to separate the closed set $K$ from the point $0\\in\\mathbb{R}\\setminus K$. Fix any open set $V$ in $X_{K}$ with $K\\subset V$. We claim $0$ is in the closure of $V$ in $X_{K}$. By the closure criterion, it suffices to show that every open neighborhood $U$ of $0$ intersects $V$.\n\nLet $U$ be an open set with $0\\in U$. Then there exists a basis element $B$ with $0\\in B\\subset U$. There are two cases.\n\nCase 1: $B=(a,b)$ with $a<0<b$. Since $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}1/n=0$, there exists $n$ with $1/n\\in(a,b)$. Because $K\\subset V$ and $V$ is open, there is a basis element $W$ with $1/n\\in W\\subset V$. As $1/n\\in K$, any basis neighborhood $W$ containing $1/n$ must be of the form $(c,d)$ (it cannot be of the form $(c,d)\\setminus K$ because that excludes $1/n$). Then $1/n\\in (a,b)\\cap(c,d)\\subset B\\cap W\\subset U\\cap V$, so $U\\cap V\\neq\\varnothing$.\n\nCase 2: $B=(a,b)\\setminus K$ with $a<0<b$. Again choose $n$ with $1/n\\in(a,b)$. As before, pick $W=(c,d)$ with $1/n\\in W\\subset V$. Then $(a,b)\\cap(c,d)$ is a nondegenerate open interval containing $1/n$, hence it contains points not in $K$ (for example, irrationals). Therefore $((a,b)\\setminus K)\\cap(c,d)\\neq\\varnothing$, so $B\\cap W\\subset U\\cap V$ is nonempty.\n\nIn either case, every neighborhood $U$ of $0$ meets $V$, so $0$ lies in the closure of $V$. Consequently, there are no disjoint open sets $U,V$ with $0\\in U$ and $K\\subset V$, and $X_{K}$ fails to be regular.\n\nNext, we analyze the subspace $Y$ of irrationals. The subspace topology on $Y$ is generated by sets of the form $B\\cap Y$ where $B$ ranges over the basis of $X_{K}$. If $B=(a,b)$, then $B\\cap Y=(a,b)\\cap Y$. If $B=(a,b)\\setminus K$, then $B\\cap Y=((a,b)\\setminus K)\\cap Y=(a,b)\\cap(Y\\setminus K)=(a,b)\\cap Y$ because $Y$ is disjoint from $K$. Hence in either case, the basic open sets in $Y$ are precisely the sets $(a,b)\\cap Y$, which are the standard subspace-open sets from the Euclidean topology on $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore the subspace topology on $Y$ inherited from $X_{K}$ agrees with the usual metric subspace topology on irrationals. Since metric spaces are regular and regularity is inherited by subspaces of metric spaces, $Y$ is regular.\n\nFinally, $Y$ is dense in $X_{K}$. Indeed, every nonempty basis element is either $(a,b)$ or $(a,b)\\setminus K$, and in either case it contains irrationals. Hence every nonempty open set in $X_{K}$ meets $Y$, so the closure of $Y$ is all of $X_{K}$.\n\nSummarizing: $X_{K}$ is not regular, $Y$ is regular, and $Y$ is dense in $X_{K}$.
