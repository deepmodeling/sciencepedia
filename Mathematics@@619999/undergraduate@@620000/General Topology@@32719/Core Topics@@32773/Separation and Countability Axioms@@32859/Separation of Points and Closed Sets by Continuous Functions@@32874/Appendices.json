Such a continuous function $f$ can exist only if the set $X$ is countable.", "solution": "The problem asks to characterize any continuous function $f$ from an infinite set $X$ with the cofinite topology to the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology.\n\nLet's start by assuming, for the sake of contradiction, that the function $f$ is **not** constant.\nIf $f$ is not a constant function, its range, denoted by $\\text{Im}(f)$, must contain at least two distinct points. Let's choose two such points, $y_1$ and $y_2$, from the range of $f$, such that $y_1 \\neq y_2$.\n\nThe codomain of our function is $\\mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology. A key property of this topological space is that it is a Hausdorff space (or a T2 space). This means that for any two distinct points $y_1, y_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exist disjoint open sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $y_1 \\in V_1$, $y_2 \\in V_2$, and $V_1 \\cap V_2 = \\emptyset$. For instance, if we let $\\epsilon = \\frac{|y_1 - y_2|}{3}$, we can choose $V_1 = (y_1 - \\epsilon, y_1 + \\epsilon)$ and $V_2 = (y_2 - \\epsilon, y_2 + \\epsilon)$. These are open intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$ and are disjoint.\n\nThe function $f$ is given to be continuous. By the definition of continuity in topology, the preimage of any open set in the codomain must be an open set in the domain. Therefore, the preimages of $V_1$ and $V_2$ under $f$, which we denote as $U_1 = f^{-1}(V_1)$ and $U_2 = f^{-1}(V_2)$, must be open sets in $X$ with respect to the cofinite topology.\n\nLet's analyze these preimages, $U_1$ and $U_2$.\n1.  Since $y_1$ and $y_2$ are in the range of $f$, there must exist at least one element $x_1 \\in X$ such that $f(x_1) = y_1$ and at least one element $x_2 \\in X$ such that $f(x_2) = y_2$.\n2.  Because $y_1 \\in V_1$, we have $x_1 \\in f^{-1}(V_1) = U_1$. Thus, $U_1$ is not the empty set.\n3.  Because $y_2 \\in V_2$, we have $x_2 \\in f^{-1}(V_2) = U_2$. Thus, $U_2$ is not the empty set.\n\nSo, $U_1$ and $U_2$ are non-empty open sets in $(X, \\mathcal{T}_c)$. According to the definition of the cofinite topology, this means their complements, $X \\setminus U_1$ and $X \\setminus U_2$, must be finite sets.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of $U_1$ and $U_2$. The preimage of an intersection of sets is the intersection of their preimages:\n$$U_1 \\cap U_2 = f^{-1}(V_1) \\cap f^{-1}(V_2) = f^{-1}(V_1 \\cap V_2)$$\nSince $V_1$ and $V_2$ were chosen to be disjoint, $V_1 \\cap V_2 = \\emptyset$. Therefore,\n$$U_1 \\cap U_2 = f^{-1}(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$$\nSo, $U_1$ and $U_2$ are disjoint sets.\n\nWe have found that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are two non-empty, disjoint, open sets in the cofinite topology on $X$. Let's examine if this is possible.\nSince $U_1$ is a non-empty open set, its complement $C_1 = X \\setminus U_1$ is finite.\nSince $U_2$ is a non-empty open set, its complement $C_2 = X \\setminus U_2$ is also finite.\nThe union of two finite sets is finite, so $C_1 \\cup C_2$ is a finite set.\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws, we can write:\n$$C_1 \\cup C_2 = (X \\setminus U_1) \\cup (X \\setminus U_2) = X \\setminus (U_1 \\cap U_2)$$\nWe have already established that $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\emptyset$. Substituting this in, we get:\n$$C_1 \\cup C_2 = X \\setminus \\emptyset = X$$\nThis implies that $X$ is equal to the set $C_1 \\cup C_2$. Since $C_1 \\cup C_2$ is a finite set, this means $X$ must be a finite set.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction. The problem statement explicitly says that $X$ is an infinite set. Therefore, our initial assumption that $f$ is not a constant function must be false.\n\nWe must conclude that $f$ is a constant function. This means that the range of $f$ contains exactly one point.\n\nLet's review the options based on this conclusion:\nA. $f$ must be a constant function. This is what our derivation has shown.\nB. $f$ must be a function with a finite, non-singleton range. This is false; we showed the range cannot contain more than one point.\nC. $f$ must be injective (one-to-one). If $f$ were injective and $X$ is infinite, its range would have to be infinite. Our contradiction argument shows this is impossible.\nD. $f$ can be any non-constant function, provided its range is a countable set. This is false.\nE. Such a continuous function $f$ can exist only if the set $X$ is countable. Our proof did not depend on the cardinality of $X$, other than it being infinite. The argument holds for both countably infinite and uncountably infinite sets.\n\nThus, the only correct characterization is that $f$ must be a constant function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1573612"}, {"introduction": "The power of topological separation extends far beyond points in Euclidean space, applying to more abstract settings like function spaces.
