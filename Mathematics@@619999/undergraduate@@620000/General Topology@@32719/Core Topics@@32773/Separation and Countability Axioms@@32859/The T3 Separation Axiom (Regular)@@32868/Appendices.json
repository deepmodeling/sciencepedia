A set $\\{x\\}$ is closed if its complement, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$, is open. For $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$ to be open, every point $y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$ must have a basic open neighborhood contained entirely within $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Consider a point $y  x$. Any open neighborhood of $y$ must be of the form $(a, \\infty)$ for some $a  y$. However, such an interval always contains $x$, since $x > y > a$.

Let's consider all pairs of distinct points $x, y \\in L$.\n\nCase 1: $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We can choose disjoint open intervals $(a_x, b_x)$ containing $x$ and $(a_y, b_y)$ containing $y$, just as in the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.

The set $U_{1,1} = ((-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_1\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $p_1$ that does not contain $p_2$. Similarly, the set $U_{2,1} = ((-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{p_2\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $p_2$ that does not contain $p_1$.\n\nSince the T1 axiom holds for all pairs of distinct points, the space $L$ is a T1 space.
