The collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of all open intervals $(q_1, q_2)$ where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) is a countable basis for the topology on $\\mathbb{R}$, and consequently, its trace on $[0,1]$ is a countable basis for $[0,1]$.\n\nNow, suppose we are given an arbitrary open cover of the interval, $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$, where $A$ is an arbitrary (possibly uncountable) index set.

Thus this procedure is not robust.\n- Option C: The collection $\\{B_{x}\\}_{x \\in [0,1]}$ consists of basis elements, not members of $\\mathcal{U}$, so it is not a subcollection of $\\mathcal{U}$. Although it is at most countable, it is not a subcover of the given cover.\n- Option D: The collection $\\{U_{x}\\}_{x \\in [0,1]}$ may have cardinality larger than countable (as large as the cardinality of $[0,1]$), so it need not be countable.\n\nHence, only option B correctly and robustly constructs a countable subcollection of $\\mathcal{U}$ that covers $[0,1]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1572668"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that second-countability is a strong condition implying both separability and the Lindelöf property.
