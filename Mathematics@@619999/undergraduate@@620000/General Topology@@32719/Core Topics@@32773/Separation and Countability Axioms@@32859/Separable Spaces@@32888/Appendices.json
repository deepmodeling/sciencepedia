We will demonstrate that in a separable metric space, any discrete subspace must be countable. We will then provide counterexamples for the other options.\n\n**Proof for Statement (B):**\n\nLet $(X, d)$ be a separable metric space, and let $A$ be a discrete subspace of $X$.\n\n1.  **Using the property of a discrete subspace:** By the definition of a discrete subspace, for each point $a \\in A$, there exists a positive real number, let's call it $\\epsilon_a > 0$, such that the open ball centered at $a$ with this radius intersects $A$ only at the point $a$. That is, $B(a, \\epsilon_a) \\cap A = \\{a\\}$.\n\n2.  **Constructing a collection of disjoint open sets:** Consider a new collection of open balls, where for each $a \\in A$, we take the ball with half the original radius: $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ B(a, \\epsilon_a/2) \\mid a \\in A \\}$. We will show that these open balls are pairwise disjoint.\n    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that two balls from this collection have a non-empty intersection. Let $a_1, a_2$ be two distinct points in $A$, and assume there is a point $z \\in X$ such that $z \\in B(a_1, \\epsilon_{a_1}/2)$ and $z \\in B(a_2, \\epsilon_{a_2}/2)$.\n    By definition of an open ball, this means $d(a_1, z) < \\epsilon_{a_1}/2$ and $d(a_2, z) < \\epsilon_{a_2}/2$.\n    Using the triangle inequality for the metric $d$, we have:\n    $d(a_1, a_2) \\le d(a_1, z) + d(z, a_2) < \\frac{\\epsilon_{a_1}}{2} + \\frac{\\epsilon_{a_2}}{2}$.\n    Now, let's look back at the initial property from step 1. Since $a_1 \\neq a_2$, $a_2$ is not in the set $\\{a_1\\}$. This means $a_2 \\notin B(a_1, \\epsilon_{a_1})$. Therefore, $d(a_1, a_2) \\ge \\epsilon_{a_1}$. Similarly, $a_1 \\notin B(a_2, \\epsilon_{a_2})$, which implies $d(a_2, a_1) \\ge \\epsilon_{a_2}$.\n    So, we have $d(a_1, a_2) \\ge \\max(\\epsilon_{a_1}, \\epsilon_{a_2})$.\n    Combining our inequalities, we get $\\max(\\epsilon_{a_1}, \\epsilon_{a_2}) \\le d(a_1, a_2) < \\frac{\\epsilon_{a_1} + \\epsilon_{a_2}}{2}$.\n    However, for any two positive numbers $x$ and $y$, it is always true that $\\max(x, y) \\ge \\frac{x+y}{2}$. This leads to a contradiction.\n    Therefore, our assumption must be false, and the open balls in the collection $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ B(a, \\epsilon_a/2) \\mid a \\in A \\}$ are pairwise disjoint.\n\n3.  **Using the property of a separable space:** The space $X$ is separable, so it contains a countable dense subset, let's call it $D$. Since $D$ is dense, for any non-empty open set $U \\subseteq X$, the intersection $U \\cap D$ is non-empty.\n    Each ball $B(a, \\epsilon_a/2)$ in our collection $\\mathcal{C}$ is a non-empty open set. Thus, for each $a \\in A$, the intersection $B(a, \\epsilon_a/2) \\cap D$ is non-empty.\n\n4.  **Establishing countability:** We can define a function $f: A \\to D$ by choosing for each $a \\in A$ a single point $d_a \\in B(a, \\epsilon_a/2) \\cap D$.\n    This function is injective (one-to-one). To see this, suppose $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ for some $a_1, a_2 \\in A$. This means they are mapped to the same point $d \\in D$. By definition of the function, $d \\in B(a_1, \\epsilon_{a_1}/2)$ and $d \\in B(a_2, \\epsilon_{a_2}/2)$. This implies the intersection $B(a_1, \\epsilon_{a_1}/2) \\cap B(a_2, \\epsilon_{a_2}/2)$ is non-empty. From step 2, we know this can only happen if $a_1 = a_2$.\n    So, $f$ is an injective function from the set $A$ to the countable set $D$. This implies that the cardinality of $A$ is less than or equal to the cardinality of $D$. Since $D$ is countable, $A$ must also be countable.\n\n**Counterexamples for other options:**\n\n*   **A) $A$ must be a closed subset of $X$:** This is false. Consider the separable metric space $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual Euclidean metric. The subspace $A = \\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 1\\}$ is discrete. For each $1/n \\in A$, we can choose $\\epsilon$ small enough, e.g., $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$, such that the ball $B(1/n, \\epsilon)$ contains no other point of $A$. However, $A$ is not closed because the sequence of points in $A$ converges to $0$, which is a limit point of $A$ but is not in $A$.\n\n*   **C) $A$ must be finite:** This is false. Consider $\\mathbb{R}$ again. The set of integers, $A = \\mathbb{Z}$, is a discrete subspace. For any integer $n$, the open ball $B(n, 0.5)$ intersects $\\mathbb{Z}$ only at $\\{n\\}$. However, $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an infinite (but countable) set. Statement (B) correctly identifies that it must be countable, which includes being countably infinite.\n\n*   **D) $A$ must be an open subset of $X$:** This is false. Again, consider $A = \\mathbb{Z}$ in $X = \\mathbb{R}$. The set $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$.
