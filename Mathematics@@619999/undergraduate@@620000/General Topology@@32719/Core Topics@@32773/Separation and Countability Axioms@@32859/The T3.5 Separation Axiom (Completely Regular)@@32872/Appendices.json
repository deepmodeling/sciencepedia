Let $x,y\\in S$ with $x\\neq y$. Then there exists $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $x_{k}\\neq y_{k}$. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is Hausdorff, choose disjoint open sets $U_{k},V_{k}\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ with $x_{k}\\in U_{k}$ and $y_{k}\\in V_{k}$.

Hence $S$ is Hausdorff.\n\nNext, we establish regularity. We will use a closure computation for basic boxes. Let $B=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}U_{n}$ be a basic open set (each $U_{n}$ open in $\\mathbb{R}$). We claim\n$$\n\\overline{B}=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\overline{U_{n}},\n$$\nwhere closures on the right-hand side are taken in $\\mathbb{R}$. For the inclusion $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\overline{U_{n}}\\subset \\overline{B}$: take any $y=(y_{n})$ with $y_{n}\\in\\overline{U_{n}}$ for all $n$. Let $N=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}V_{n}$ be any basic neighborhood of $y$, so each $V_{n}$ is open with $y_{n}\\in V_{n}$. Since $y_{n}\\in\\overline{U_{n}}$, we have $V_{n}\\cap U_{n}\\neq\\emptyset$ for each $n$. Choose $a_{n}\\in V_{n}\\cap U_{n}$ for each $n$. Then $a=(a_{n})\\in N\\cap B$, so $N\\cap B\\neq\\emptyset$, hence $y\\in\\overline{B}$. For the reverse inclusion, let $y\\notin\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\overline{U_{n}}$. Then for some $k$, $y_{k}\\notin\\overline{U_{k}}$, so there exists an open $V_{k}\\ni y_{k}$ with $V_{k}\\cap U_{k}=\\emptyset$. Set $V_{n}=\\mathbb{R}$ for $n\\neq k$. Then $N=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}V_{n}$ is a basic neighborhood of $y$ disjoint from $B$, so $y\\notin\\overline{B}$. Therefore the equality of closures holds.\n\nNow let $x\\in S$ and let $O\\subset S$ be open with $x\\in O$. Choose a basic box $B=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}U_{n}$ such that $x\\in B\\subset O$. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is regular, for each $n$ choose an open $W_{n}\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ with $x_{n}\\in W_{n}$ and $\\overline{W_{n}}\\subset U_{n}$.

Hence $S$ is regular.\n\nFinally, we show that $S$ is completely regular by exhibiting a uniformity that induces the box topology. Equip each factor $\\mathbb{R}$ with its standard (metric) uniformity. Define on $S$ the box uniformity whose basic entourages are products $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}E_{n}$, where each $E_{n}$ is an entourage in the uniformity of $\\mathbb{R}$. This family satisfies the uniformity axioms:\n- Each $\\prod E_{n}$ contains the diagonal because each $E_{n}$ does.\n- It is symmetric since each $E_{n}$ is symmetric.\n- Given $U=\\prod U_{n}$, for each $n$ choose $W_{n}$ with $W_{n}\\circ W_{n}\\subset U_{n}$, then $W=\\prod W_{n}$ satisfies $W\\circ W\\subset U$.\n- It is closed under finite intersections and supersets because $(\\prod U_{n})\\cap(\\prod V_{n})=\\prod (U_{n}\\cap V_{n})$ and enlargements are preserved componentwise.\n\nThe topology induced by this uniformity has a neighborhood base at $x$ consisting of sets of the form\n$$\n(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}E_{n})[x]=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}E_{n}[x_{n}],\n$$\nwhere $E_{n}[x_{n}]=\\{y_{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}:(x_{n},y_{n})\\in E_{n}\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $x_{n}$. Conversely, given any basic box neighborhood $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}U_{n}$ of $x$, for each $n$ there exists an entourage $E_{n}$ with $E_{n}[x_{n}]\\subset U_{n}$ (e.g., balls of sufficiently small radius in the metric uniformity), so $(\\prod E_{n})[x]\\subset \\prod U_{n}$. Therefore the induced topology of this uniformity is exactly the box topology. The uniformity is separated: if $x\\neq y$, pick $k$ with $x_{k}\\neq y_{k}$ and choose an entourage $E_{k}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ small enough so that $(x_{k},y_{k})\\notin E_{k}$; for $n\\neq k$ take $E_{n}=\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$; then $(x,y)\\notin \\prod E_{n}$, so the intersection of all entourages is the diagonal. It is a standard theorem that every topology arising from a separated uniformity is completely regular. Hence $S$ is completely regular.\n\nSummarizing: $S$ is Hausdorff, regular, and completely regular. Therefore the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1589537"}]}
