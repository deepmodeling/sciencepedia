Since $X = U \\cup V$, and $U$ and $V$ are non-empty and disjoint, the space is not connected.\n-   **Conclusion for A:** This space is $T_0$ and not connected.

We must check all pairs of distinct points:\n    -   For $(1, 2)$: The open set $\\{1\\}$ contains 1 but not 2.\n    -   For $(1, 3)$: The open set $\\{1\\}$ contains 1 but not 3.\n    -   For $(1, 4)$: The open set $\\{1\\}$ contains 1 but not 4.\n    -   For $(2, 3)$: The open set $\\{1, 3\\}$ contains 3 but not 2.\n    -   For $(2, 4)$: The open set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ contains 2 but not 4.\n    -   For $(3, 4)$: The open set $\\{1, 3\\}$ contains 3 but not 4.\n    Since every pair of distinct points can be separated by an open set, the space is $T_0$.\n-   **Is it connected?** Yes. To check for connectedness, we can find the closed sets, which are the complements of the open sets:\n    -   Closed sets: $X, \\{2, 3, 4\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{4\\}, \\emptyset$.\n    The only sets that are in both the list of open sets and the list of closed sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$.

Both of these sets also contain point $2$.\n    -   The open sets containing point $2$ are $\\{1, 2\\}$ and $X$. Both of these sets also contain point $1$.\n    -   There is no open set that contains one of these points but not the other. Therefore, the space is **not** $T_0$. The points $1$ and $2$ are topologically indistinguishable.\n-   **Is it connected?** Yes. We list the open sets and their corresponding closed sets (complements):\n    -   Open sets: $\\emptyset, \\{1, 2\\}, X$.\n    -   Closed sets: $X, \\{3, 4\\}, \\emptyset$.\n    The only sets that are both open and closed are $\\emptyset$ and $X$. There are no non-trivial clopen sets. Therefore, the space is connected.\n-   **Conclusion for C:** This space is **not $T_0$** and is **connected**. This matches the problem's requirements.\n\n**Option D: $\\tau_D = \\{ \\emptyset, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{3, 4\\}, X \\}$**\nThis is a valid topology.\n-   **Is it a $T_0$ space?** No. Similar to option C, the points $1$ and $2$ are topologically indistinguishable because the only open sets containing either are $\\{1, 2\\}$ and $X$, which contain both. The same applies to points $3$ and $4$. Thus, the space is **not** $T_0$.\n-   **Is it connected?** No. Let $U = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $V = \\{3, 4\\}$. Both $U$ and $V$ are non-empty sets in the topology $\\tau_D$. They are disjoint ($U \\cap V = \\emptyset$) and their union is the entire space ($U \\cup V = X$). By definition, the existence of such a partition of $X$ into two non-empty disjoint open sets means the space is not connected.\n-   **Conclusion for D:** This space is not $T_0$ and not connected.
