A fundamental theorem in topology states that a product of non-empty spaces is regular if and only if each factor space is regular.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the space $Y = (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$. The usual topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ is metrizable (e.g., by the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$). Every metric space is a regular space. Therefore, $Y = (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$ is a regular space. This eliminates option D.\n\nNext, we analyze the space $X = (\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathcal{T}_c)$. We must check if it meets the two conditions for regularity.\n1.  **Is $X$ a T1 space?**\n    Let $m, n$ be two distinct points in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Consider the set $U = \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{n\\}$. The complement of $U$ is the singleton set $\\{n\\}$, which is finite. By the definition of the cofinite topology, $U$ is an open set.

This shows that $X = (\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathcal{T}_c)$ is a T1 space. This means the premise in option B is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Does $X$ satisfy the separation condition for regularity?**\n    Let's test the main condition for regularity. We need to find a closed set $F$ and a point $p \\notin F$ and see if we can separate them with disjoint open sets. In the cofinite topology, a set is closed if it is finite or all of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Let's choose a non-empty finite closed set, for example, $F = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    Let's choose a point not in $F$, for example, $p = 2$.\n    According to the regularity definition, there must exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p \\in U$ and $F \\subseteq V$.\n    Let's consider the nature of any two non-empty open sets in this topology. Let $U_1$ and $U_2$ be any two non-empty open sets in $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathcal{T}_c)$. By definition, their complements, $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U_1$ and $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U_2$, are finite.\n    We examine their intersection $U_1 \\cap U_2$. Using de Morgan's laws, the complement of the intersection is the union of the complements:\n    $$ \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus (U_1 \\cap U_2) = (\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U_1) \\cup (\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U_2) $$\n    Since $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U_1$ and $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U_2$ are both finite sets, their union is also a finite set.\n    A set whose complement is finite is, by definition, a non-empty open set in the cofinite topology (it is non-empty because its complement is not all of $\\mathbb{Z}$). Thus, $U_1 \\cap U_2$ is a non-empty open set.\n    This demonstrates that any two non-empty open sets in $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathcal{T}_c)$ always have a non-empty intersection. They can never be disjoint.\n    Returning to our specific case with $p=2$ and $F=\\{0,1\\}$, any open set $U$ containing $p$ must be non-empty, and any open set $V$ containing $F$ must also be non-empty. Therefore, $U$ and $V$ cannot be disjoint.\n    Since we have found a closed set $F$ and a point $p \\notin F$ that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets, the space $X = (\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathcal{T}_c)$ is not regular. This falsifies the premise in option A.\n\nNow we can draw a conclusion about the product space $Z = X \\times Y$.\nSince the factor space $X$ is not regular, the product space $Z$ is also not regular. The property of regularity is such that if a product is regular, all its factors must be regular.\nTherefore, the statement \"Z is not regular because the space X is not a regular space\" is the correct explanation.\n\nLet's review the remaining options:\n- A. False. $X$ is not regular.\n- B. False. $X$ is a T1 space, but it is not regular, and the conclusion that $Z$ is regular is incorrect.\n- C. True. $Z$ fails to be regular precisely because one of its factor spaces, $X$, is not regular.\n- D. False. $Y$ is a regular space.\n- E. False. This statement claims a topological property that is not true. This problem itself serves as a counterexample: $X$ is T1, $Y$ is regular, but their product $Z$ is not regular.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1569446"}]}
