A topological space with the discrete topology is second-countable if and only if the underlying set is countable.\n\nLet's establish this principle.\nFirst, assume the set $X$ is countable. To show that $(X, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{discrete}})$ is second-countable, we must find a countable basis for the discrete topology. Consider the collection of all singleton sets, $\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\{x\\} \\mid x \\in X\\}$. In the discrete topology, any open set $U \\subseteq X$ can be written as the union of the singleton sets of its elements: $U = \\bigcup_{x \\in U} \\{x\\}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the discrete topology. Since $X$ is countable, the set $\\mathcal{B}$ of its singletons is also countable. Therefore, we have found a countable basis, and the space is second-countable.\n\nConversely, assume the space $(X, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{discrete}})$ is second-countable. This means there exists a countable basis $\\mathcal{B}$. For any element $x \\in X$, the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is an open set in the discrete topology. Since $\\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, $\\{x\\}$ must be representable as a union of elements from $\\mathcal{B}$. As $\\{x\\}$ contains only one point, this implies that for each $x \\in X$, there must be a basis element $B_x \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B_x \\subseteq \\{x\\}$. This forces $B_x = \\{x\\}$. Therefore, every singleton set $\\{x\\}$ for $x \\in X$ must be an element of the basis $\\mathcal{B}$. This shows that the collection of all singletons, $\\{\\{x\\} \\mid x \\in X\\}$, is a subset of the countable basis $\\mathcal{B}$. A subset of a countable set is itself countable. Since the set of singleton sets is countable and there is a clear bijection between $X$ and $\\{\\{x\\} \\mid x \\in X\\}$, the set $X$ must be countable.\n\nThus, we have established that a space $(X, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{discrete}})$ is second-countable if and only if the set $X$ is countable. We now apply this criterion to each option.\n\nA. The set is $X_A = \\mathbb{Q}$, the set of rational numbers. It is a standard result in set theory that $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set. Since $X_A$ is countable, the space $(\\mathbb{Q}, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{discrete}})$ is second-countable.\n\nB. The set is $X_B$, the set of all sequences of integers $(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots)$ where only a finite number of terms are non-zero. Let an element of this set be a function $a: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ with finite support. Let $S_n$ be the subset of $X_B$ containing sequences where $a_k = 0$ for all $k > n$. An element of $S_n$ is uniquely determined by the tuple $(a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is countable. A finite Cartesian product of countable sets, such as $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, is countable. Thus, each set $S_n$ is countable. The total set $X_B$ is the union of all such sets: $X_B = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty S_n$. This expresses $X_B$ as a countable union of countable sets. A fundamental theorem of set theory states that a countable union of countable sets is countable. Therefore, $X_B$ is a countable set, and the space $(X_B, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{discrete}})$ is second-countable.\n\nC. The set is $X_C$, the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$. This set is often denoted as $\\{0, 1\\}^\\mathbb{N}$. There is a bijection between this set and the power set of the natural numbers, $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$, where a function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ corresponds to the subset $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid f(n)=1\\}$. By Cantor's theorem, the power set of any set has a strictly greater cardinality than the set itself. Since $\\mathbb{N}$ is infinite, $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable. Therefore, $X_C$ is an uncountable set. Consequently, the space $(X_C, \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{discrete}})$ is not second-countable.\n\nD. The set is $X_D = (0, 1)$, the open interval of real numbers between 0 and 1. This set has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, which is uncountable. Since $X_D$ is uncountable, the space $((0, 1), \\mathcal{T}_{\\text{discrete}})$ is not second-countable.\n\nBased on this analysis, the spaces corresponding to sets A and B are second-countable, while those corresponding to C and D are not.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1571205"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how second-countability behaves in the discrete case, we now turn to a more subtle construction on the real line. The Sorgenfrey line, defined by a basis of half-open intervals $[a, b)$, is famous for being a highly instructive counterexample in topology.

For each $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set $[x, x+1)$ is open and contains $x$, so there exists $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $x \\in B_{x} \\subset [x, x+1)$. Write $B_{x} = [a_{x}, b_{x})$ with $a_{x} < b_{x}$. From $x \\in [a_{x}, b_{x})$ we have $a_{x} \\le x < b_{x}$. From $B_{x} \\subset [x, x+1)$ and the fact that $a_{x} \\in B_{x}$, we also have $a_{x} \\ge x$. Hence $a_{x} = x$. Therefore $B_{x} = [x, b_{x})$, and for $x \\ne y$ we must have $B_{x} \\ne B_{y}$ because their left endpoints differ.
