The topology is given by $\\tau = \\{\\emptyset, \\{c\\}, \\{a, b\\}, X\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Test for convergence to point $a$.**\nFor the sequence to converge to $a$, for every open set $U \\in \\tau$ containing $a$, there must exist an $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $x_n \\in U$.\nThe open sets in $\\tau$ that contain $a$ are $U_1 = \\{a, b\\}$ and $U_2 = X$.\n\n- For $U_1 = \\{a, b\\}$: We need to check if there is an $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $x_n \\in \\{a, b\\}$.

This is possible because the topological space $(X, \\tau)$ is not a Hausdorff (T2) space, which allows for sequences to have more than one limit.

This practice asks you to compare the behavior of sequences on the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ under two vastly different topologies: the standard one and the cofinite one. This comparison powerfully illustrates how the underlying structure of open sets dictates which sequences converge and to what limits [@problem_id:1546894].", "problem": "Consider the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, equipped with two different topologies.\nThe first is the usual (or standard) topology, denoted by $\\tau_{usual}$, where the open sets are arbitrary unions of open intervals.\nThe second is the cofinite topology, denoted by $\\tau_{cofinite}$, where a subset $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as open if it is the empty set or if its complement, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus U$, is a finite set.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between the convergence of a sequence in these two topological spaces.

Define the sequence $x_{n}=n$. Fix any $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any $\\tau_{cofinite}$-open neighborhood $U$ of $L$. Then $U=\\mathbb{R}\\setminus F$ where $F$ is finite and $L \\notin F$.
