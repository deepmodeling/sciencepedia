The classical result is that this is impossible; this is the standard proof that the Sorgenfrey plane is not normal. The geometric reason is tied to the nature of basic neighborhoods in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}^{2}$: for any $(x,-x)$, a basic open rectangle $[x, x+\\alpha)\\times[-x, -x+\\beta)$ extends only to the northeast from the point $(x,-x)$. If we attempt to assign to each rational $q$ such a northeast rectangle contained in an open $U$ and to each irrational $r$ such a northeast rectangle contained in an open $V$, then because rationals and irrationals are both dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ and because every such rectangle from a point on $L$ moves northeast, one cannot keep the unions of these two families disjoint. Intuitively, any open set that covers all rational anti-diagonal points must, via these northeast extensions, intrude into any open set that covers all irrational anti-diagonal points, and vice versa.

It is false that $L$ is not closed; in fact $L$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}^{2}$ and has the discrete subspace topology. Hence $A$ and $B$ are closed. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. It is false that $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is not normal; in fact $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is normal (indeed perfectly normal). Moreover, even the general claim “the product of two normal spaces is always normal” is false. The reasoning is incorrect.\n\nD. This captures the correct mechanism: because of the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q}$ and the shape of basic open rectangles in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}^{2}$, any open set covering $A$ and any open set covering $B$ must intersect, showing that $A$ and $B$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.
