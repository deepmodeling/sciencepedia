Let's consider the two distinct \"origin\" points, $o_1$ and $o_2$.\n\nLet $W_1$ be an arbitrary open neighborhood of the point $o_1$. By the definition of a topology generated by a basis, $W_1$ must contain at least one basis element that contains $o_1$. According to the problem statement, any basis element containing $o_1$ must be of the form $U_\\epsilon(o_1) = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_1\\}$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. So, for some $\\epsilon_1 > 0$, we have $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\subseteq W_1$.\n\nSimilarly, let $W_2$ be an arbitrary open neighborhood of the point $o_2$. By the same logic, there must exist a basis element $U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) = (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_2\\}$ for some $\\epsilon_2 > 0$ such that $U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) \\subseteq W_2$.\n\nNow, let's examine the intersection of these arbitrary neighborhoods, $W_1 \\cap W_2$. If we can show that this intersection is always non-empty, then the points $o_1$ and $o_2$ cannot be separated, and the space is not Hausdorff.\n\nSince $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\subseteq W_1$ and $U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) \\subseteq W_2$, it follows that $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\cap U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) \\subseteq W_1 \\cap W_2$. Let's compute the intersection of these two basis elements:\n$$U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\cap U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2) = \\left( (-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_1\\} \\right) \\cap \\left( (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_2\\} \\right)$$\nSince $o_1$ and $o_2$ are distinct points not in $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\{o_1\\} \\cap \\left( (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_2\\} \\right) = \\emptyset$ and $\\left( (-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{o_1\\} \\right) \\cap \\{o_2\\} = \\emptyset$.\nThe intersection simplifies to:\n$$ \\left( (-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\right) \\cap \\left( (-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\right) $$\nLet $\\epsilon_{\\min} = \\min(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2)$.

The intersection of the two intervals $(-\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_1)$ and $(-\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_2)$ is $(-\\epsilon_{\\min}, \\epsilon_{\\min})$.\nTherefore, the intersection of the basis elements is $(-\\epsilon_{\\min}, \\epsilon_{\\min}) \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nThis resulting set is non-empty. For instance, the point $\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\min}}{2}$ is in this set. Since $U_{\\epsilon_1}(o_1) \\cap U_{\\epsilon_2}(o_2)$ is non-empty, and this intersection is a subset of $W_1 \\cap W_2$, it must be that $W_1 \\cap W_2$ is also non-empty.\n\nThis demonstrates that any open neighborhood $W_1$ of $o_1$ and any open neighborhood $W_2$ of $o_2$ have a non-empty intersection. Consequently, it is impossible to find disjoint open sets containing $o_1$ and $o_2$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, the space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is not a Hausdorff space. This conclusion matches option B.\n\nLet's briefly consider the other options:\nA is incorrect because satisfying the Hausdorff condition for some pairs of points is not sufficient. It must hold for all pairs of distinct points. The pair $(o_1, o_2)$ is a counterexample.\nC is incorrect. The distinctness of two sets is not the same as them being disjoint. Disjoint means their intersection is empty, which is not the case here.\nD is incorrect. A point $x > 0$ can be separated from a point $y < 0$. We can find small open intervals around each that do not contain 0 and are disjoint. For example, if $x=1$ and $y=-1$, the neighborhoods $(0.5, 1.5)$ and $(-1.5, -0.5)$ are disjoint open sets separating them.\nE is incorrect. The collection of sets does form a valid basis.

Therefore, $\\mathbb{R}$ with the cocountable topology is **not a `$T_2$` space**.\n\n2.  **Is it a US-space?**\n    We need to determine if every convergent sequence has a unique limit. Let's first characterize which sequences can converge in this topology.\n    Let $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$. Suppose it converges to a limit $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We will show that this implies the sequence must be eventually constant, i.e., there exists an integer $N_0$ such that $x_n = L$ for all $n \\ge N_0$.\n\n    Consider the set of values of the sequence, $S = \\{x_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This set is at most countable.\n    Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $L$ but is *not* eventually constant at $L$. This means that for any $N$, there is some $n > N$ such that $x_n \\neq L$. Consequently, the set of points in the sequence not equal to $L$, let's call it $S_L = \\{x_n \\mid x_n \\neq L\\}$, must be an infinite set. Since $S_L \\subseteq S$, $S_L$ is a countably infinite set.\n\n    Now, consider the set $U = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus S_L$. The complement of $U$ is $S_L$, which is countable. By the definition of the cocountable topology, $U$ is an open set. Also, by construction, $L \\notin S_L$, so $L \\in U$. Thus, $U$ is an open neighborhood of the limit $L$.\n\n    By the definition of convergence, since $x_n \\to L$, there must exist an integer $N$ such that for all $n \\ge N$, we have $x_n \\in U$. But the elements of $U$ are precisely the real numbers that are *not* in $S_L$. This means that for $n \\ge N$, $x_n \\notin S_L$. By the definition of $S_L$, this implies that $x_n = L$ for all $n \\ge N$. This contradicts our assumption that the sequence was not eventually constant at $L$.\n\n    Therefore, any convergent sequence in this space must be eventually constant. If a sequence is eventually constant, say $x_n = c$ for all $n \\ge N_0$, it can only converge to $c$. If it were to converge to some $L \\neq c$, then the set $V = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{c\\}$ would be an open neighborhood of $L$.

Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ be distinct. Any open set $U$ containing $x$ has a finite complement, $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U$. Any open set $V$ containing $y$ has a finite complement, $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus V$. The complement of their intersection, $(\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U) \\cup (\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus V)$, is a union of two finite sets, hence finite. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is infinite, $U \\cap V$ cannot be empty. So, this space is not `$T_2$`.\n\n2.  **Is it a US-space?** No. Consider the sequence of distinct integers, for example, $(x_n) = (n)_{n=1}^\\infty$. Let $L$ be any integer in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $L$. By definition of the cofinite topology, the complement $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U$ is a finite set. Since the sequence $(x_n)$ consists of infinitely many distinct terms, it cannot be contained within any finite set. This implies that all but a finite number of its terms must lie in $U$. This is the definition of convergence. So, the sequence $x_n \\to L$. Since we chose $L$ arbitrarily, this means the sequence $(n)$ converges to *every* point in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Since limits are not unique, this space is not a US-space.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: $\\mathbb{R}$ with the Standard Topology**\n\n1.  **Is it a `$T_2$` space?** Yes. This is a standard result.

The open intervals $U = (x - d/2, x + d/2)$ and $V = (y - d/2, y + d/2)$ are disjoint open sets containing $x$ and $y$, respectively. So, the space is `$T_2$`.\n\n2.  **Is it a US-space?** Yes. Since it is a `$T_2$` space, it must also be a US-space. This fails the \"not `$T_2$`\" condition of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: $X$ with the Indiscrete Topology**\n\n1.  **Is it a `$T_2$` space?** No. Let $x, y$ be two distinct points in $X$.

So, the space is not `$T_2$`.\n\n2.  **Is it a US-space?** No. Let $(x_n)$ be any sequence in $X$. Let $L$ be any point in $X$. The only open neighborhood of $L$ is the entire space $X$.
