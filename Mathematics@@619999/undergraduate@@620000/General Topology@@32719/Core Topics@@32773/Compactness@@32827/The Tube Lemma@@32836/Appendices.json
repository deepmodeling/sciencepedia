The set $\\{x_0\\} \\times Y$ consists of $n$ distinct points: $(x_0, y_1), (x_0, y_2), \\dots, (x_0, y_n)$.\n\nSince $N$ is open and contains each of these $n$ points, for each point $(x_0, y_i)$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$), there must exist a basic open set of the product topology, let's call it $B_i$, such that $(x_0, y_i) \\in B_i \\subseteq N$.\n\nThe basis for the product topology on $X \\times Y$ consists of all sets of the form $U \\times V$, where $U$ is an open set in $X$ and $V$ is an open set in $Y$. Therefore, for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, our basic open set $B_i$ can be written as $U_i \\times V_i$, where $U_i$ is open in $X$ and $V_i$ is open in $Y$.\n\nThe condition $(x_0, y_i) \\in U_i \\times V_i$ implies that $x_0 \\in U_i$ and $y_i \\in V_i$.\n\nWe are given that the space $Y$ has the discrete topology. In the discrete topology, any subset of $Y$ is an open set. In particular, for each $y_i$, the singleton set $\\{y_i\\}$ is an open set in $Y$. We are free to choose our basic open sets, so we can make a specific choice for each $V_i$. A valid and useful choice is to take $V_i = \\{y_i\\}$. This is a valid open set in $Y$ containing $y_i$.\n\nWith this choice, for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we have found an open set $U_i \\subseteq X$ such that $x_0 \\in U_i$ and $U_i \\times \\{y_i\\} \\subseteq N$.

Consider the set $W = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} U_i$.\nFirst, let's check if $W$ is an open set containing $x_0$. Each $U_i$ is an open set in $X$. Since $Y$ is a finite set with $n$ elements, the intersection defining $W$ is a finite intersection of open sets. A fundamental axiom of topology states that the finite intersection of open sets is always open. Thus, $W$ is an open set in $X$. Furthermore, since $x_0 \\in U_i$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$, it must be that $x_0$ is in their intersection. So, $x_0 \\in W$. Therefore, $W$ is an open set in $X$ containing $x_0$.\n\nNow, let's verify if $W \\times Y \\subseteq N$. Let $(x, y)$ be an arbitrary point in $W \\times Y$. By definition, this means $x \\in W$ and $y \\in Y$. Since $y \\in Y = \\{y_1, \\dots, y_n\\}$, there must be some index $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $y = y_k$.\nSince $x \\in W = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} U_i$, we know that $x$ is in every $U_i$, including $U_k$. So, $x \\in U_k$.\nThis means that the point $(x, y) = (x, y_k)$ belongs to the set $U_k \\times \\{y_k\\}$.\nFrom our construction, we know that $U_k \\times \\{y_k\\} \\subseteq N$. Therefore, $(x, y) \\in N$.\nSince $(x, y)$ was an arbitrary point in $W \\times Y$, we have successfully shown that $W \\times Y \\subseteq N$.\n\nOur construction demonstrates that it is always possible to find such an open set $W$ containing $x_0$, and that this set can be constructed by taking the intersection of a finite collection of open sets. This directly corresponds to statement C.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other options:\nA is false. Our proof did not rely on $X$ being compact. The critical feature was the finiteness of $Y$.\nB is false. A union $W_{union} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i$ would be too large.

Our derivation works for any open set $N$, which can be a union of many basic open sets. We did not assume $N$ itself was a single basic open set.\nE is false.
