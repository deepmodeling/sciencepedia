A space is sequentially compact if and only if every sequence has a convergent subsequence. We will analyze each option to find the correct statement.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of convergence in the Sorgenfrey line. A sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ in the topology $\\tau_{S}$ if for every neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there exists an integer $N$ such that $x_n \\in U$ for all $n  N$. Since the basis for $\\tau_S$ consists of intervals of the form $[a, b)$, this means that for any $b  p$, the sequence must eventually be in the interval $[p, b)$. This implies two conditions:\n1. $x_n \\to p$ in the standard Euclidean topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. For $n$ large enough, $x_n \\geq p$.\nIn essence, a sequence converges to $p$ in the Sorgenfrey topology if and only if it converges to $p$ from the right (or is eventually constant at $p$).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: The Sorgenfrey line is sequentially compact because every sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$ has a monotonic subsequence, which must converge in this topology.**\nThe first part of this statement is true by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence, and every unbounded sequence has a monotonic subsequence. However, the conclusion that a monotonic subsequence must converge in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\tau_S)$ is false. For example, consider the strictly increasing sequence $x_n = -\\frac{1}{n}$. This sequence converges to $0$ in the standard topology. However, as we will show in the analysis of option C, it does not converge to any point in the Sorgenfrey topology. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: The Sorgenfrey line is not sequentially compact because the sequence defined by $x_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ has no convergent subsequence.**\nLet's analyze the sequence $x_n = \\frac{1}{n} = \\{1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\dots\\}$. We will test if this sequence converges to $0$ in the Sorgenfrey topology. A basic neighborhood of $0$ is of the form $[0, b)$ for some $b  0$. According to the Archimedean property, for any such $b$, we can find an integer $N$ such that $N  \\frac{1}{b}$. For all integers $n \\geq N$, we have $0  \\frac{1}{n} \\leq \\frac{1}{N}  b$. This shows that $x_n \\in [0, b)$ for all $n \\geq N$. Therefore, the sequence $x_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ converges to $0$ in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\tau_{S})$. Since the sequence itself converges, every subsequence also converges to $0$. The statement that this sequence has no convergent subsequence is false. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: The Sorgenfrey line is not sequentially compact because the sequence defined by $x_n = -\\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ has no convergent subsequence.**\nLet's analyze the sequence $x_n = -\\frac{1}{n} = \\{-1, -\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\dots\\}$. Let $\\{x_{n_k}\\}$ be an arbitrary subsequence of $\\{x_n\\}$. In the standard topology, $\\{x_{n_k}\\}$ converges to $0$. Let's see if it can converge to any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ in the Sorgenfrey topology.\n- Case 1: The potential limit is $p \\geq 0$. A basic neighborhood of $p$ is of the form $[p, p+1)$. All terms of the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ are strictly negative. Therefore, for any $k$, $x_{n_k} = -\\frac{1}{n_k}  0 \\leq p$. This means no term of the subsequence lies in the neighborhood $[p, p+1)$. Thus, the subsequence cannot converge to any $p \\geq 0$.\n- Case 2: The potential limit is $p  0$. Since the sequence $\\{x_{n_k}\\}$ converges to $0$ in the standard topology, it is strictly increasing and all its terms are eventually greater than any given negative number. Let $p$ be any negative number. Consider the neighborhood $U = [p, \\frac{p}{2})$. Since $\\frac{p}{2}  p$ (as $p  0$), this is a valid Sorgenfrey neighborhood of $p$. As $k \\to \\infty$, we have $n_k \\to \\infty$, and so $x_{n_k} = -\\frac{1}{n_k} \\to 0$. This means for any $\\epsilon  0$, there is a $K$ such that for $kK$, $|x_{n_k}|  \\epsilon$. If we choose $\\epsilon = |\\frac{p}{2}|$, then for $kK$, we have $x_{n_k}  -\\epsilon = \\frac{p}{2}$. This means for $k$ large enough, all terms of the subsequence are outside the neighborhood $U=[p, \\frac{p}{2})$. Therefore, the subsequence cannot converge to $p$.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possible limits $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and found that no subsequence of $\\{x_n\\}$ can converge, the Sorgenfrey line is not sequentially compact. The reason provided in this option is correct.\n\n**Option D: The Sorgenfrey line is sequentially compact because every closed and discrete subset of the Sorgenfrey line is finite.**\nA space in which every closed and discrete subset is finite is called countably compact (in the sense that every infinite subset has a limit point). For T1 spaces, sequential compactness implies countable compactness. So if the Sorgenfrey line were sequentially compact, it would have to be countably compact. Let's test the premise that every closed and discrete subset of the Sorgenfrey line is finite. Consider the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a discrete subset because for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the neighborhood $[n, n+1)$ contains no other integers. $\\mathbb{Z}$ is also a closed set in the Sorgenfrey topology (its complement $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Z} = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (n, n+1)$ is a union of open sets, hence open). Therefore, $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an infinite, closed, and discrete subset. This contradicts the claim made in the option.
