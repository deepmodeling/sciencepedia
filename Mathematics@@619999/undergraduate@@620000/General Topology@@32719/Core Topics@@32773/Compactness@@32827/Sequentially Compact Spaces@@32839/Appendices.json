In a metric subspace, a sequence converges to a point of the subspace if and only if it converges to that point in the ambient metric space. Thus, convergence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is the same as convergence in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to a point of $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we record a structural fact about $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. For any two distinct points $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, one has\n$$\nd(p,q)\\ge 1,\n$$\nbecause their coordinates are integers. Hence, any Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is eventually constant: given $\\varepsilon=\\frac{1}{2}$, there exists $N$ such that for all $m,n\\ge N$, $d(x_{m},x_{n})<\\frac{1}{2}$; but since distinct points are at distance at least $1$, this forces $x_{n}$ to be equal for all $n\\ge N$. In particular, any convergent sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is eventually constant.\n\nTo decide sequential compactness, it suffices to exhibit a sequence in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ with no convergent subsequence. Consider $s_n=(n,0)$ for $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Any subsequence $(s_{n_{k}})$ has $n_k\\to\\infty$, so it is unbounded in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

Equivalently, by the eventual-constancy observation above, no subsequence of $(s_{n})$ can be eventually constant (each term is distinct), so no subsequence converges.\n\nThus, $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is not sequentially compact. Among the options, C provides the correct counterexample and justification.
