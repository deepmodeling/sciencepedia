The set in question is $S=\\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}:x^{4}+y^{2}+z^{6}=1\\}=f^{-1}(\\{1\\})$.\n\nTo analyze boundedness, observe that for all $(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ one has $x^{4}\\geq 0$, $y^{2}\\geq 0$, and $z^{6}\\geq 0$. If $(x,y,z)\\in S$, then $x^{4}+y^{2}+z^{6}=1$, which implies $x^{4}\\leq 1$, $y^{2}\\leq 1$, and $z^{6}\\leq 1$.
