This conclusion relies on a key property connecting compactness and the Hausdorff condition.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and complete justification for why $x$ must belong to $K$?\n\nA. In any topological space, a compact set is necessarily sequentially compact. This means every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence that converges to a point within $K$. This forces the limit of the original convergent sequence to also be in $K$.\n\nB. Since $X$ is a Hausdorff space, limits of sequences are unique. As all points $x_n$ are in the set $K$, the unique limit $x$ must also be in $K$.\n\nC. The property that $X$ is Hausdorff implies that every compact subspace, such as $K$, is also a closed set in $X$. By the definition of a closed set, it must contain all of its limit points. Since $x$ is the limit of a sequence in $K$, it is a limit point of $K$ and therefore must be in $K$.\n\nD. Every compact space can be endowed with a metric that makes it a complete metric space. In a complete metric space, every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence and must converge to a point within the space. Therefore, the limit $x$ must be in $K$.\n\nE.

We want to justify that $x \\in K$.\n\nFirst, we observe that convergence of the sequence implies that $x$ is in the closure of $K$. Indeed, by the definition of convergence, for every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $x_{n} \\in U$ for all $n > N$.

We justify this property: let $x \\in X \\setminus K$. For each $y \\in K$, since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $U_{y}$ and $V_{y}$ with $y \\in U_{y}$ and $x \\in V_{y}$.

Equivalently, since open sets in the subspace topology are of the form $O \\cap K$ for $O$ open in $X$, it suffices to consider covers of $K$ by sets of the form $O_{\\alpha} \\cap K$ where each $O_{\\alpha}$ is open in $X$.\n\nWe now prove that $K$ is compact in any topological space, hence in particular in a Hausdorff space.
