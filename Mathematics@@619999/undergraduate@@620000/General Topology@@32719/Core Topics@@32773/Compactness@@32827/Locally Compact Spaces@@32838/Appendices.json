By the Heine–Borel theorem, a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The set $L$ is bounded. It is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ because, for example, the sequence $(1-\\frac{1}{n},\\frac{1}{2})\\in L$ converges to $(1,\\frac{1}{2})\\notin L$. Therefore $L$ is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, hence not compact. Thus option A is false.\n\nSecond, connectedness. The set $[0,1)$ is an interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, and every interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected. The product of connected spaces is connected, so $L=[0,1)\\times[0,1)$ is connected. Hence $L$ is connected.\n\nThird, local compactness. A space is locally compact if every point has a neighborhood whose closure is compact. Fix $p=(x,y)\\in L$.

Any neighborhood $U$ of $0_{1}$ in $L$ has preimage $q^{-1}(U)$ an open set in $X$ containing $(0,1)$, hence contains some interval $I\\times\\{1\\}$ with $0\\in I$ open in $\\mathbb{R}$. Similarly, any neighborhood $V$ of $0_{2}$ has preimage containing some $J\\times\\{2\\}$ with $0\\in J$ open. For any $x\\in I\\cap J$ with $x\\neq 0$, we have $q(x,1)=q(x,2)\\in U\\cap V$, so $U$ and $V$ cannot be disjoint. Thus $0_{1}$ and $0_{2}$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets, hence $L$ is not Hausdorff. Therefore (i) is false.\n\nFor local compactness, fix $p\\in L$. If $p$ corresponds to a nonzero real $a$, its local neighborhoods are homeomorphic to those in $\\mathbb{R}$, which is locally compact. So we need only check the origins. Consider $p=0_{1}$. Let $U=q((-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)\\times\\{1\\})$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. Let $K'=[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon]\\times\\{1\\}$. This is a compact set in $X$. Its image $C=q(K')$ is compact in $L$ because $q$ is continuous. The closure of $U$ in $L$, $\\overline{U}$, is contained in $C$. As a closed subset of a compact set, $\\overline{U}$ is compact. So $0_1$ has a compact neighborhood. The same argument works at $0_{2}$. Therefore $L$ is locally compact, so (ii) is true.\n\nFor connectedness, we show $L$ is path-connected. The space $L$ is the union of two sets: $L_1 = q(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{1\\})$ and $L_2 = q(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{2\\})$. The sets $L_1$ and $L_2$ are path-connected because they are continuous images of the path-connected space $\\mathbb{R}$. Furthermore, $L_1$ and $L_2$ have a non-empty intersection, for example, the point $q(1,1) = q(1,2)$ is in both sets. A union of path-connected subspaces with a non-empty intersection is path-connected. Therefore, $L$ is path-connected and hence connected. Thus (iii) is true.\n\nFor first countability, at any nonzero point $a$ the neighborhood system is as in $\\mathbb{R}$, so a countable neighborhood base exists. At $0_{1}$, consider the family\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}_{1}=\\big\\{\\,q((-\\tfrac{1}{n},\\tfrac{1}{n})\\times\\{1\\}) : n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\,\\big\\}.\n$$\nIf $O\\subset L$ is any neighborhood of $0_{1}$, then $q^{-1}(O)$ is open in $X$ and contains $(0,1)$, so there exists an open interval $I$ about $0$ with $I\\times\\{1\\}\\subset q^{-1}(O)$; choose $n$ with $(-\\tfrac{1}{n},\\tfrac{1}{n})\\subset I$, then $q((-\\tfrac{1}{n},\\tfrac{1}{n})\\times\\{1\\})\\subset O$. Hence $\\mathcal{B}_{1}$ is a countable neighborhood base at $0_{1}$. The same construction at $0_{2}$ with the second copy yields a countable base there.
