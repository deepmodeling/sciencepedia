This exercise [@problem_id:1331307] provides a foundational check of these concepts, asking you to articulate precisely why the EVT applies to any polynomial function on a closed interval, a common scenario in calculus and analysis.", "problem": "A fundamental result in real analysis is the Extreme Value Theorem (EVT), which states: If a real-valued function $f$ is continuous on a closed and bounded interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ must attain a global maximum and a global minimum value on $[a, b]$.\n\nConsider a general polynomial function, $p(x) = c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + c_1 x + c_0$, where the coefficients $c_i$ are real numbers and $n$ is a non-negative integer.

The function $p(x)$ is a polynomial, and all polynomials are infinitely differentiable. The EVT requires differentiability to find extrema.\n\nB. The interval $[-M, M]$ is a closed and bounded set. The properties of the function are irrelevant as long as the interval has this form.\n\nC. The function $p(x)$ is continuous on $[-M, M]$ because all polynomials are continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, and the interval $[-M, M]$ is both closed and bounded.\n\nD. For any polynomial $p(x)$ of degree at least one, the limit of $|p(x)|$ as $x \\to \\infty$ is $\\infty$. This forces the function to have a turning point on any interval, which must be an extremum.\n\nE. The function $p(x)$ is continuous on the interval $[-M, M]$. The EVT applies to any continuous function defined on any type of interval.", "solution": "We recall the Extreme Value Theorem: if $f:[a,b]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded, then there exist points $x_{\\min},x_{\\max}\\in [a,b]$ such that $f(x_{\\min}) \\leq f(x) \\leq f(x_{\\max})$ for all $x\\in [a,b]$. Equivalently, a continuous function on a compact interval attains a global minimum and a global maximum.\n\nWe verify the EVT hypotheses for the given polynomial on $[-M,M]$ with $M>0$.\n1) Continuity of $p$: The function $x\\mapsto x$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. For each integer $k\\geq 0$, the map $x\\mapsto x^{k}$ is continuous as a finite product of continuous functions. Multiplying a continuous function by a real constant preserves continuity, and finite sums of continuous functions are continuous. Therefore, the polynomial $p(x)=c_{n}x^{n}+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+c_{1}x+c_{0}$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, hence on $[-M,M]$.\n2) Compactness of the domain: The interval $[-M,M]$ is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}$. By the Heineâ€“Borel theorem, $[-M,M]$ is compact.\n\nBy the EVT, since $p$ is continuous on the compact interval $[-M,M]$, there exist $x_{\\min},x_{\\max}\\in [-M,M]$ such that $p(x_{\\min}) \\leq p(x) \\leq p(x_{\\max})$ for all $x\\in [-M,M]$. Hence $p$ attains a global minimum and a global maximum on $[-M,M]$.\n\nWe now assess the options:\nA. Incorrect. EVT requires continuity, not differentiability. For instance, $f(x)=|x|$ is continuous but not differentiable at $0$, and EVT still applies on $[-1,1]$.\nB. Incorrect. The interval being closed and bounded is necessary but not sufficient; the function must also be continuous on the interval.\nC. Correct. Polynomials are continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, and $[-M,M]$ is closed and bounded, so EVT applies and guarantees global extrema.\nD. Incorrect. Asymptotic behavior as $x\\to\\infty$ is irrelevant for extrema on a bounded interval; also, the claim about forcing a turning point on any interval is false (e.g., constant or linear polynomials) and extrema can occur at endpoints.\nE. Incorrect. EVT does not apply on arbitrary intervals; it specifically requires closed and bounded intervals (compactness) in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, the complete and correct justification is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1331307"}, {"introduction": "The Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that a maximum and minimum exist, but it doesn't tell us where to find them.

Then $y<x_{\\max}$ implies $f(y)>f(x_{\\max})$, again a contradiction.\n\nThus $x_{\\max}\\notin (a,b)$, so the maximum must occur at an endpoint.\n\nSimilarly, assume, for contradiction, that $x_{\\min}\\in (a,b)$ is a point where the global minimum is attained.\n- If $f$ is strictly increasing, pick any $y\\in [a,x_{\\min})$.
