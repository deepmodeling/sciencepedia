By modeling a network as a graph, we can use its structural properties—specifically, the number of vertices and edges—to deduce global information. This exercise focuses on a special type of graph called a forest (a graph with no cycles), revealing a simple yet elegant relationship between its vertices ($n$), edges ($m$), and connected components ($k$). Mastering this allows you to determine the number of separate sub-networks without ever having to map them out individually. [@problem_id:1359146]", "problem": "An ancient manuscript describes the complex web of mentorship among a community of 50 philosophers. Each mentorship represents a direct, two-way intellectual link between a pair of individuals. The manuscript emphasizes a core principle of their community: to avoid doctrinal loops and circular reasoning, no philosopher could be an indirect mentor to themselves through any chain of other mentors. A historian has meticulously cataloged a total of 42 distinct mentorship links described in the text. This structure implies that the philosophers were organized into several completely separate schools of thought. Within each school, every philosopher is connected to every other philosopher through at least one path of mentorships, but no mentorship link of any kind exists between different schools. Determine the total number of separate schools of thought that existed in this community.", "solution": "Model the philosophers as vertices of an undirected graph and the two-way mentorship links as edges. The rule that no philosopher could be an indirect mentor to themselves through any chain forbids any closed chain, which is precisely the absence of cycles in the graph. Therefore, the graph is a forest, i.e., a disjoint union of trees.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of vertices, $m$ the number of edges, and $k$ the number of connected components (schools). A fundamental property of forests is that each connected component is a tree, and for a tree with $n_{i}$ vertices, the number of edges is $n_{i}-1$. Summing over all components yields\n$$\nm=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(n_{i}-1)=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_{i}\\right)-k=n-k,\n$$\nwhere $n=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_{i}$ is the total number of vertices.\n\nGiven $n=50$ and $m=42$, substitute into the forest identity:\n$$\n42=50-k \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad k=50-42=8.\n$$\nThus, there are $8$ separate schools of thought.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1359146"}, {"introduction": "While mathematical formulas can help us count components under certain conditions, we often need a practical method to identify the members of a specific component. This exercise simulates a real-world scenario of network analysis, where you are given the raw connectivity data. You will use a systematic traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore a sub-network starting from a single node, effectively mapping its entire communication reach.

Communication between outposts is only possible if a direct link exists. The complete network topology is described by the following adjacency list, where each outpost is listed with the other outposts it can directly communicate with.
