A key property of the closed interval $[0,1]$ with its standard topology is that it is a connected topological space.\n\nStep 2: Apply the theorem on continuous images of connected spaces.\nA fundamental theorem of topology states that the image of a connected space under a continuous function is connected. Since the domain $X = [0,1]$ is connected and the function $f: X \\to Y$ is continuous, the image $f(X)$ must be a connected subspace of the codomain $Y$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the codomain space and its connected subspaces.\nThe codomain is the set $Y = [0,1]$ equipped with the discrete topology. In the discrete topology, every subset of $Y$ is open. Let's determine which subspaces of $Y$ are connected.\n\nA topological space $S$ is disconnected if there exist two non-empty, disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $S = U \\cup V$. A space is connected if it is not disconnected.\n\nConsider an arbitrary subset $S \\subseteq Y$. We want to know when $S$ is connected (viewed as a subspace of $Y$).\n- If $S$ is the empty set, it is connected by convention.\n- If $S$ is a singleton set, i.e., $S = \\{y_0\\}$ for some $y_0 \\in Y$, it cannot be written as the union of two non-empty disjoint open sets. Thus, any singleton set is connected.\n- If $S$ contains more than one point, let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be two distinct points in $S$. Let $U = \\{y_1\\}$ and $V = S \\setminus \\{y_1\\}$. In the discrete topology on $Y$, any subset is open. Therefore, $\\{y_1\\}$ is an open set in $Y$. The set $S \\setminus \\{y_1\\}$ is also a subset of $Y$, so it is also open in $Y$. When we consider the subspace topology on $S$, the open sets are intersections of open sets from $Y$ with $S$. So, $U = \\{y_1\\} = \\{y_1\\} \\cap S$ is open in $S$. Similarly, $V = (S \\setminus \\{y_1\\}) = (Y \\setminus \\{y_1\\}) \\cap S$ is open in $S$ (since $Y \\setminus \\{y_1\\}$ is open in $Y$). The sets $U$ and $V$ are non-empty (since $S$ has at least two points), they are disjoint, and their union is $S$. This shows that $S$ is disconnected.\n\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that the only connected subspaces of a space with the discrete topology are the empty set and singleton sets.\n\nStep 4: Combine the results.\nFrom Step 2, we know that the image $f(X)$ must be a connected subspace of $Y$. From Step 3, we know that the only connected subspaces of $Y$ are the empty set and singleton sets.\nThe domain $X = [0,1]$ is not empty, so its image $f(X)$ under any function $f$ cannot be the empty set.\nTherefore, the image $f(X)$ must be a singleton set. This means that $f(X) = \\{c\\}$ for some constant $c \\in Y = [0,1]$. In other words, the function $f$ must be a constant function.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The image $f(X)$ can be any finite subset of $Y$. This is false. A finite set with more than one element is disconnected in the discrete topology.\n- B. The image $f(X)$ must be a singleton set (a set containing exactly one point). This is true, as derived above.\n- C. The image $f(X)$ can be any closed interval $[a, b]$ where $0 \\le a \\le b \\le 1$. This is false. Any such interval with $a < b$ contains more than one point and would be disconnected in the discrete topology. This would be true if $Y$ had the standard topology (by the Intermediate Value Theorem).\n- D. The image $f(X)$ must be the entire set $Y$. This is false. The set $Y=[0,1]$ has infinitely many points and is therefore disconnected in the discrete topology.\n- E. The image $f(X)$ can be any countable subset of $Y$. This is false.

Consider two specific topological spaces.\n\nThe first space is the topologist's sine curve, denoted by $S$.

Yes, such a function exists. One can construct a function that maps the oscillatory part of the curve to a dense subset of the rationals and then use the limit segment $\\{0\\} \\times [-1, 1]$ to \"fill in\" the remaining rational numbers.\nB. No, such a function cannot exist. The cardinality of the topologist's sine curve is that of the continuum, $|\\mathbb{R}|$, while the cardinality of the rational numbers is countable.
