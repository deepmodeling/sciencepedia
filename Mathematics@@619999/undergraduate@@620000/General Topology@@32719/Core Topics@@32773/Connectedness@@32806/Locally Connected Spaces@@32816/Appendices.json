A space is disconnected if there exist disjoint nonempty open sets whose union is $X$, equivalently if there exists a nontrivial clopen set. The open sets are $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b\\},\\{a,b\\},X$. Compute complements of proper open sets:\n- $X\\setminus\\{a\\}=\\{b,c\\}\\notin\\tau$,\n- $X\\setminus\\{b\\}=\\{a,c\\}\\notin\\tau$,\n- $X\\setminus\\{a,b\\}=\\{c\\}\\notin\\tau$.\nThus no proper nonempty open set is closed, so there is no nontrivial clopen subset. Therefore $(X,\\tau)$ is connected. Equivalently, there is no pair of disjoint nonempty open sets whose union is $X$, since the only open set containing $c$ is $X$ itself, which cannot be part of a disjoint union covering $X$.\n\nNext, determine local connectedness. A space is locally connected if for every $x\\in X$ and every open $U$ with $x\\in U$, there exists a connected open set $V$ such that $x\\in V\\subseteq U$. Identify the connected open sets:\n- The singletons $\\{a\\}$ and $\\{b\\}$ are open and connected.\n- The set $\\{a,b\\}$ is open but disconnected as a subspace (since in the subspace topology on $\\{a,b\\}$ both $\\{a\\}$ and $\\{b\\}$ are open and form a separation).\n- The whole space $X$ is connected as shown above.\n\nNow verify the local connectedness condition pointwise:\n- For $x=a$, the open neighborhoods are $\\{a\\}$, $\\{a,b\\}$, and $X$. In each case, choose $V=\\{a\\}$, which is connected, open, contains $a$, and is contained in the given neighborhood.\n- For $x=b$, the open neighborhoods are $\\{b\\}$, $\\{a,b\\}$, and $X$. In each case, choose $V=\\{b\\}$ with the same properties.\n- For $x=c$, the only open neighborhood is $X$. Choose $V=X$, which is connected and open, contains $c$, and satisfies $V\\subseteq X$.\n\nHence the space is locally connected.

A standard topological principle states that the continuous image of a connected space is connected. Since $f$ is continuous and surjective, its image $X$ is connected.\n\nLocal connectedness: Fix any $q\\in X$ and any neighborhood $W$ of $q$ in $X$. Because $f$ is surjective, there exists $\\theta_{0}\\in(0,2\\pi)$ with $f(\\theta_{0})=q$. Since $W$ is open in $X$ and $f$ is continuous, the preimage $f^{-1}(W)$ is an open neighborhood of $\\theta_{0}$ in $(0,2\\pi)$. Hence there exists an open interval $I\\subset(0,2\\pi)$ with $\\theta_{0}\\in I\\subset f^{-1}(W)$. Then $V:=f(I)$ satisfies $q\\in V\\subset W$. The set $V$ is connected because it is the continuous image of the interval $I$. It is also open in $X$ because for each $\\theta\\in I$, there exists a smaller open subinterval $J_{\\theta}\\subset I$ with $f(J_{\\theta})$ an open arc in $X$ containing $f(\\theta)$, and $V=\\bigcup_{\\theta\\in I}f(J_{\\theta})$ is thus a union of open sets in $X$.

Let's analyze the connectedness and local connectedness of $X$.\n\nLet $\\pi: S \\sqcup I \\to X$ be the quotient map that identifies $p=(1, \\sin(1)) \\in S$ with $q=0 \\in I$. The points of $X$ can be thought of as the points of $S \\cup I$ with this identification. We denote the identified point in $X$ as $p^* = \\pi(p) = \\pi(q)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the connectedness of $X$.**\n\nThe Topologist's Sine Curve $S$ is a standard example of a connected space. To see this, let $A = \\{ (x, \\sin(1/x)) \\mid x \\in (0, 1] \\}$. The set $A$ is the image of the connected interval $(0, 1]$ under a continuous map, so $A$ is connected. The space $S$ is the union of $A$ and a subset of its limit points, namely the segment $L = \\{ (0, y) \\mid y \\in [-1, 1] \\}$. We have $S = \\text{closure}(A)$. Since the closure of a connected set is connected, $S$ is connected.\n\nThe interval $I = [0, 1]$ is also a connected space.\n\nThe space $X$ is the union of the images of $S$ and $I$ under the quotient map, i.e., $X = \\pi(S) \\cup \\pi(I)$. The sets $\\pi(S)$ and $\\pi(I)$ are connected because they are continuous images of connected sets. These two connected sets have a point in common, the identification point $p^*$. A theorem in topology states that the union of a collection of connected subspaces that have at least one point in common is itself connected. Therefore, the space $X = \\pi(S) \\cup \\pi(I)$ is connected.\n\nThis immediately rules out option D.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the path-connectedness of $X$.**\n\nThe Topologist's Sine Curve $S$ is not path-connected. There is no path in $S$ connecting a point on the graph part, like $(1, \\sin(1))$, to a point on the limit segment, like $(0,0)$. The attachment of the interval $I$ does not remedy this. Any path starting on the attached interval or on the graph part of $S$ would need to have finite length. However, to approach a point on the limit segment $L$, the path would have to traverse infinitely many oscillations of the sine curve, leading to an infinite path length. Thus, no path can connect the points in $\\pi(S \\setminus L) \\cup \\pi(I \\setminus \\{q\\})$ to the points in $\\pi(L)$. Therefore, $X$ is not path-connected.\n\nThis rules out option A. It also means option E is potentially true, but we still need to check local connectedness.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the local connectedness of $X$.**\n\nA space is locally connected if for every point $x$ and every neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists a connected open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that $V \\subseteq U$.\n\nLet's examine local connectedness at different points in $X$.\n\nCase 1: Points in $\\pi(S \\setminus (L \\cup \\{p\\}))$.\nThese are points on the \"wavy\" part of the curve, not including the attachment point or the limit segment. For any such point $a$, we can find a small open ball in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ around it whose intersection with $S$ is an arc. This arc is a connected open neighborhood of $a$ in $X$. So, $X$ is locally connected at these points.\n\nCase 2: The attachment point $p^* = \\pi(p) = \\pi(q)$.\nConsider a small open neighborhood $U$ of $p^*$ in $X$. Its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in the disjoint union $S \\sqcup I$ that contains both $p=(1, \\sin(1))$ and $q=0$. Thus, $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ contains an open neighborhood $U_S$ of $p$ in $S$ and an open neighborhood $U_I$ of $q$ in $I$. We can choose $U_S$ to be a small arc on the curve around $p$ and $U_I$ to be a small interval of the form $[0, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. The set $V = \\pi(U_S \\cup U_I)$ is an open neighborhood of $p^*$ contained in $U$. Since $U_S$ and $U_I$ are connected and their images in $X$ share the point $p^*$, their union $V$ is connected. Thus, $X$ is locally connected at the attachment point $p^*$. This rules out option C.\n\nCase 3: Points in $\\pi(I \\setminus \\{q\\})$.\nThese are the interior and the other endpoint of the attached interval. At any such point, the neighborhoods are homeomorphic to open intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$, which are connected. So $X$ is locally connected at these points.\n\nCase 4: Points in $\\pi(L)$, where $L = \\{ (0, y) \\mid y \\in [-1, 1] \\}$.\nLet $a = (0, y_0)$ be a point on the limit segment, and consider its image $\\pi(a)$ in $X$. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $\\pi(a)$ in $X$. We can take $U$ to be the intersection of $X$ with a small open ball $B_\\epsilon(\\pi(a))$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This neighborhood $U$ contains an open segment of the line $L$ around $\\pi(a)$. However, it also contains infinitely many disjoint arcs from the wavy part of the curve that \"pile up\" near the segment $L$. Any open set $V \\subseteq U$ containing $\\pi(a)$ must also contain points from these disjoint arcs. There is no way to draw a small connected neighborhood around $\\pi(a)$ because any such neighborhood will be \"shattered\" into a piece on the line segment and infinitely many disconnected pieces from the sine curve. This is the same reason the original Topologist's Sine Curve is not locally connected at points in $L$. The attachment of the interval at $(1, \\sin(1))$ is \"far away\" from $L$ and does not change this local property.\nTherefore, $X$ is not locally connected at any point in $\\pi(L)$.\n\n**Summary of Properties:**\n- $X$ is connected.\n- $X$ is not path-connected.\n- $X$ is not locally connected. Specifically, it fails to be locally connected at all points of the limit segment $\\pi(L)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\nA. $X$ is path-connected and locally connected.

(True).\nC. $X$ is connected, but it is not locally connected at the point where the interval $I$ is attached to the curve $S$. (False, it is locally connected there).\nD. $X$ is neither connected nor path-connected. (False, it is connected).\nE. $X$ is connected and locally connected, but it is not path-connected.
