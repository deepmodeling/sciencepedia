Recall the definition: a space is locally path-connected at $p$ if for every neighborhood $U$ of $p$ (equivalently, every open set $U$ with $p \\in U$), there exists a path-connected neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that $p \\in V \\subseteq U$.\n\n1) Points on a bristle away from the origin are locally path-connected.\n\nFix $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and a point $p=(x, x/n) \\in L_{n}$ with $0<x\\leq 1$.

Then $U \\subset L_{n}$ and is an open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$. Being an open sub-arc of a line segment, $U$ is path-connected. Thus every such $p$ is locally path-connected.\n\nThe same argument applies to the bristle endpoints $p=(1,1/n)$: for fixed $n$, the distances to the $x$-axis and to other bristles are strictly positive, so a small enough Euclidean ball intersects $B$ only in a sub-arc of $L_{n}$; hence $p$ has a basis of open path-connected neighborhoods.\n\n2) The origin is locally path-connected.\n\nLet $p=(0,0)$. For any $r>0$, consider $U=B \\cap B(p,r)$, which is an open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$. For any two points $a,b \\in U$, the straight segments $[a,p] \\subset L_{n}$ (for the appropriate $n$ or the handle) and $[p,b]$ lie in $B$, and since $B(p,r)$ is convex, both segments lie inside $B(p,r)$. Hence $U$ is path-connected. Therefore taking $V=U$ shows $B$ is locally path-connected at the origin.\n\n3) Points on the handle away from the origin are not locally path-connected.\n\nFix $p=(x,0)$ with $0<x \\leq 1$. Choose $r$ with $0<r<x/2$. Let $U=B \\cap B(p,r)$, an open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$ that does not contain the origin. For each $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, the distance from $p$ to the line $y=(1/m)x$ is\n$$\nd_{m}(p)=\\frac{|-(1/m)x+0|}{\\sqrt{(1/m)^{2}+1}}=\\frac{x/m}{\\sqrt{1+m^{2}}}=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+m^{2}}}.\n$$\nAs $m \\to \\infty$, $d_{m}(p) \\to 0$, so for any such $r$ there exists $m$ with $d_{m}(p)<r$. Thus $U$ contains points from infinitely many bristles $L_{m}$.\n\nSuppose $V$ is any neighborhood of $p$ with $V \\subseteq U$ and path-connected. As a neighborhood in $B$, $V$ contains some open set $B \\cap W$ with $p \\in W$ open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, hence contains $B \\cap B(p,\\rho)$ for some $0<\\rho \\leq r$. By the same distance estimate, $B \\cap B(p,\\rho)$ contains points from some bristle $L_{m}$, all of which are disjoint from the handle inside $U$ because $U$ does not contain the origin and bristles meet the handle only at $(0,0)$. Therefore no path in $B$ from $p$ to any point of $L_{m} \\cap U$ can lie inside $U$, so $V \\subseteq U$ cannot be path-connected if it contains both $p$ and such bristle points. To keep $V$ path-connected and contain $p$, one would have to exclude all bristle points, but then $V$ cannot be a neighborhood of $p$ in $B$ because every open neighborhood of $p$ in $B$ contains bristle points. Hence no path-connected neighborhood of $p$ exists inside $U$, so $B$ is not locally path-connected at $p$.\n\nConclusion: $B$ is locally path-connected at all points except those on the handle with $0<x\\leq 1$.

Let $\\varepsilon>0$ and consider $V=S\\cap B((0,0),\\varepsilon)$, where $B((0,0),\\varepsilon)=\\{z\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\|z\\|<\\varepsilon\\}$. Then $V$ is open in $S$ and, for any $u,v\\in V$, the path $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to S$ defined by\n$$\n\\gamma(t)=\\begin{cases}\n(1-2t)u, & 0\\leq t\\leq \\frac{1}{2},\\\\\n(2t-1)v, & \\frac{1}{2}\\leq t\\leq 1,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nlies in $V$. Indeed, $(1-2t)u$ lies on the unique rational-slope line through $u$ and $(2t-1)v$ lies on the unique rational-slope line through $v$, so $\\gamma(t)\\in S$ for all $t$.

Thus $z\\in S\\cap B(p,\\delta)\\subset V$ and $z$ lies on a different rational-slope line than $p$.\n\nBecause $V\\subset U$ and $(0,0)\\notin U$, any path in $V$ avoids the origin. Consider any continuous path $\\alpha:[0,1]\\to V\\subset S\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ with $\\alpha(0)=p$ and $\\alpha(1)=z$.
