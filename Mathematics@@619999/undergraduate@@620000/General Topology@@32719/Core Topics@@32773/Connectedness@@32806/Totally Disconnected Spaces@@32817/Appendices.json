The key concepts are connectivity, connected components, and the Hausdorff property.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a connected space. A topological space $S$ is said to be disconnected if there exist two non-empty, disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $S = U \\cup V$. If no such pair of sets exists, the space $S$ is connected.\nIn our case, the space is $(X, \\mathcal{T}_{ind})$ where the open sets are $\\mathcal{T}_{ind} = \\{\\emptyset, X\\}$. Let's check if $X$ is connected. To be disconnected, we would need two non-empty, disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ whose union is $X$. The only non-empty open set in this topology is $X$ itself. Therefore, we cannot find two such non-empty sets $U$ and $V$. It is impossible to form a partition of $X$ into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. Thus, the space $X$ with the indiscrete topology is a connected space.\n\nNext, we consider the connected component of a point $x \\in X$, denoted by $C(x)$. The connected component of $x$ is the largest connected subset of $X$ that contains the point $x$. We have just established that the entire space $X$ is connected. Since $x \\in X$, $X$ is a connected set containing $x$. As $X$ is the entire space, no subset containing $x$ can be larger than $X$. Therefore, the largest connected subset containing $x$ is $X$ itself. This means that for any point $x \\in X$, its connected component is $C(x) = X$.\n\nNow we can evaluate each of the given options:\n\nA) For every $x \\in X$, $C(x) = \\{x\\}$. This statement is false. We found that $C(x) = X$. The problem states that $X$ contains at least two distinct points, so $X \\neq \\{x\\}$.\n\nB) The space $(X, \\mathcal{T}_{ind})$ is a totally disconnected space. A space is defined as totally disconnected if its only connected components are single-point sets (singletons). This is equivalent to statement A being true for all $x$. Since A is false, B is also false. The connected components are the entire space $X$, not singletons.\n\nC) The space $(X, \\mathcal{T}_{ind})$ is a Hausdorff space. A space is Hausdorff (or $T_2$) if for any two distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$. Let's pick two distinct points $x, y \\in X$. The only open set containing $x$ is $X$. Similarly, the only open set containing $y$ is $X$. So we must choose $U=X$ and $V=X$. The intersection of these neighborhoods is $U \\cap V = X \\cap X = X$. Since $X$ is not empty, $U$ and $V$ are not disjoint. Therefore, the space is not Hausdorff. This statement is false.\n\nD) For every $x \\in X$, $C(x) = X$. This matches our derivation. For any point $x \\in X$, its connected component is the whole space $X$. This statement is true.\n\nE) There exists a pair of distinct points $x, y \\in X$ such that $C(x) = \\{x\\}$ and $C(y) = X$. This is false. We have shown that for *every* point $z \\in X$, the connected component is $C(z) = X$.
