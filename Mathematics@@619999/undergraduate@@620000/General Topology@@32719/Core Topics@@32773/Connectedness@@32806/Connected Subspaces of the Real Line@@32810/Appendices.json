The interval $[1, 2]$ constitutes a \"gap\" between the original two intervals. Adding a single point $p$ to the union is insufficient to fill this entire gap.

If $x,y \\le 0$, then $[x,y] \\subseteq (-\\infty,0] \\subseteq S$, so for any $x \\le 0$, the maximal connected subset of $S$ containing $x$ includes every $y \\le 0$, and thus the connected component containing any $x \\le 0$ is exactly $(-\\infty,0]$.\n\nSecond, consider a point $a_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}$ with $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

We will determine the exact form of the set $S$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the bounds of the set $S$.\nAn element $x \\in C$ is in the interval $[0, 1]$. To see this, note that for any $x = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k/3^k$ with $a_k \\in \\{0, 2\\}$, we have:\n$0 = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 0/3^k \\le x \\le \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2/3^k$.\nThe upper bound is a geometric series: $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2(1/3)^k = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1/3}{1 - 1/3} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1/3}{2/3} = 1$.\nSo, $C \\subseteq [0, 1]$.\nFor any element $z \\in S$, we have $z = x+y$ where $x, y \\in C$. Since $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y \\le 1$, it follows that $0 \\le x+y \\le 2$. This implies that $S \\subseteq [0, 2]$.\n\nNow, we will show the more surprising result: that $S$ is in fact equal to the entire interval $[0, 2]$. To do this, we need to show that for any arbitrary number $w \\in [0, 2]$, we can find two numbers $x, y \\in C$ such that $x+y = w$.\n\nLet $w$ be an arbitrary number in $[0, 2]$. We will construct the ternary expansions of $x$ and $y$ digit by digit. Let the desired numbers be $x = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k/3^k$ and $y = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} b_k/3^k$, where each $a_k, b_k \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\nWe define a sequence $w_k$ recursively. Let $w_0 = w$. For $k \\ge 1$, we define $w_k$ and the digits $a_k, b_k$ as follows. At step $k$, given $w_{k-1} \\in [0, 2]$, consider the value $3w_{k-1} \\in [0, 6]$. We choose the sum of the digits $c_k = a_k+b_k$ based on which subinterval contains $3w_{k-1}$:\n1. If $3w_{k-1} \\in [0, 2]$, we choose $(a_k, b_k) = (0, 0)$. Then $c_k = 0$.\n2. If $3w_{k-1} \\in (2, 4]$, we choose $(a_k, b_k) = (2, 0)$. Then $c_k = 2$.\n3. If $3w_{k-1} \\in (4, 6]$, we choose $(a_k, b_k) = (2, 2)$. Then $c_k = 4$.\n\nNote that in case 2, we could have also chosen $(a_k, b_k) = (0, 2)$. Our choice is arbitrary but fixed for the construction. The digits $a_k, b_k$ are always in $\\{0, 2\\}$, so the resulting numbers $x$ and $y$ will be in $C$.\n\nNow, we define the next term in the sequence as $w_k = 3w_{k-1} - c_k$. Let's check that $w_k$ remains in the interval $[0, 2]$.\n1. If $c_k=0$, then $w_k = 3w_{k-1} \\in [0, 2]$.\n2. If $c_k=2$, then $w_k = 3w_{k-1} - 2$. Since $3w_{k-1} \\in (2, 4]$, we have $w_k \\in (0, 2]$.\n3. If $c_k=4$, then $w_k = 3w_{k-1} - 4$. Since $3w_{k-1} \\in (4, 6]$, we have $w_k \\in (0, 2]$.\nIn all cases, $w_k \\in [0, 2]$. So, our recursive construction is well-defined for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nFrom the recurrence relation $w_k = 3w_{k-1} - (a_k+b_k)$, we can write $w_{k-1} = \\frac{a_k+b_k}{3} + \\frac{w_k}{3}$.\nLet's expand this for $w_0=w$:\n$w = w_0 = \\frac{a_1+b_1}{3} + \\frac{w_1}{3}$\n$w = \\frac{a_1+b_1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{a_2+b_2}{3} + \\frac{w_2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{a_1+b_1}{3} + \\frac{a_2+b_2}{3^2} + \\frac{w_2}{3^2}$\nBy induction, we can show that for any $N \\ge 1$:\n$$ w = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{a_k+b_k}{3^k} + \\frac{w_N}{3^N} $$\nNow, we take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$. Since $w_N$ is always in the interval $[0, 2]$, the remainder term $\\frac{w_N}{3^N}$ goes to 0:\n$$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{w_N}{3^N} = 0 $$\nThus, we are left with:\n$$ w = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_k+b_k}{3^k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_k}{3^k} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{b_k}{3^k} $$\nBy our construction, the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ consist entirely of digits from $\\{0, 2\\}$. Therefore, if we define $x = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k/3^k$ and $y = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} b_k/3^k$, we have $x \\in C$ and $y \\in C$.\nWe have successfully shown that for any $w \\in [0, 2]$, there exist $x, y \\in C$ such that $w = x+y$. This means $[0, 2] \\subseteq S$.\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1. $S \\subseteq [0, 2]$\n2. $[0, 2] \\subseteq S$\nWe conclude that $S = C+C = [0, 2]$.\n\nThe set $[0, 2]$ is a closed and bounded interval on the real line. A fundamental theorem in topology states that a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is an interval. Since $[0, 2]$ is an interval, it is connected.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $S$ is a closed and bounded interval. This is true, as we have shown $S=[0, 2]$.\nB. $S$ is a totally disconnected set with positive Lebesgue measure. This is false. The Cantor set $C$ is totally disconnected, but its Minkowski sum is connected. The Lebesgue measure of $S=[0,2]$ is $2$, which is positive, but the set is not totally disconnected.\nC. $S$ is a nowhere dense set. This is false. A non-empty interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is not nowhere dense. For instance, the interior of $S$ is $(0, 2)$, which is not empty.\nD. $S$ is a countable union of disjoint closed intervals. This is false. It is a single interval.\nE. $S$ is equal to the Cantor set $C$.
