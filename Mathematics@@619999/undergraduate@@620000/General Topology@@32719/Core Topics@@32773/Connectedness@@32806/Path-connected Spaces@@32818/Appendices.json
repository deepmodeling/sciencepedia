A path is a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \\to X$.\n\nLet's recall the definition of continuity. A function $f: A \\to B$ between two topological spaces is continuous if for every open set $V$ in $B$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V) = \\{a \\in A \\mid f(a) \\in V\\}$ is an open set in $A$.\n\nIn our case, the domain is the interval $[0, 1]$ with its standard topology, and the codomain is the set $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5\\}$ with the discrete topology. In the discrete topology on $X$, *every* subset of $X$ is open.\n\nLet $f: [0, 1] \\to X$ be an arbitrary continuous function. Let's consider the image of this function, $\\text{Im}(f)$, which is a subset of $X$. For any point $y \\in \\text{Im}(f)$, the singleton set $\\{y\\}$ is a subset of $X$. Since $X$ has the discrete topology, $\\{y\\}$ is an open set in $X$.\n\nBy the definition of continuity, the preimage of this open set, $f^{-1}(\\{y\\})$, must be an open set in $[0, 1]$.\n\nLet's consider all the distinct points in the image of $f$, say $\\text{Im}(f) = \\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_k\\}$, where $k \\le 5$.\nFor each $y_i \\in \\text{Im}(f)$, the set $U_i = f^{-1}(\\{y_i\\})$ is an open subset of $[0, 1]$.\nThese sets $U_i$ are pairwise disjoint, because if $t \\in U_i \\cap U_j$ for $i \\neq j$, then $f(t) = y_i$ and $f(t) = y_j$, which contradicts $y_i \\neq y_j$ (as $f$ is a function).\nThe union of these sets covers the entire domain: $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} U_i = f^{-1}(\\{y_1, \\dots, y_k\\}) = f^{-1}(\\text{Im}(f)) = [0, 1]$.\n\nSo, we have a partition of the interval $[0, 1]$ into a collection of disjoint, non-empty, open sets $\\{U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_k\\}$.\n\nA fundamental property of the interval $[0, 1]$ (with its standard topology) is that it is a connected space. A connected space cannot be written as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open sets.\nSince our collection $\\{U_1, \\dots, U_k\\}$ is a partition of $[0, 1]$ into disjoint open sets, the connectedness of $[0, 1]$ implies that this partition can contain at most one non-empty set. Thus, we must have $k=1$.\n\nThis means that the image of any continuous function $f: [0, 1] \\to X$ can contain only one point. In other words, any such continuous function must be a constant function. So, $f(t) = c$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$, where $c$ is some fixed point in $X$.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the definition of a path. A path from a point $x \\in X$ to a point $y \\in X$ is a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \\to X$ such that $f(0) = x$ and $f(1) = y$.\nAs we've just shown, any such function must be constant. Therefore, we must have $f(0) = f(1)$. This implies that $x=y$.\n\nThis result means that a path can only connect a point to itself. Two distinct points $x \\neq y$ in $X$ cannot be connected by a path.\n\nThe path components are the equivalence classes of the path-connectedness relation. Since each point is only path-connected to itself, the equivalence class for any point $p_i \\in X$ is simply the singleton set $\\{p_i\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the space $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5\\}$ is partitioned into five path components: $\\{p_1\\}, \\{p_2\\}, \\{p_3\\}, \\{p_4\\},$ and $\\{p_5\\}$.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. The entire set $X$ is the only path component. (Incorrect, as distinct points are not path-connected.)\nB. The path components cannot be determined without more information.
