Because $G_{N}\\subseteq U_{N}$ and $G_{N}\\cap G_{N+1}\\neq\\emptyset$, we have $U_{N}\\cap G_{N+1}\\supseteq G_{N}\\cap G_{N+1}\\neq\\emptyset$.

A simpler version is: if $Y = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are path-connected and $A \\cap B \\neq \\emptyset$, then $Y$ is path-connected. We can apply this theorem iteratively.\n\nOur space is $X = G \\cup L \\cup C_1$. The sets $G$, $L$, and $C_1$ are all path-connected. To make their union path-connected, we need to form a \"bridge\" between the two disconnected path-components of $C_0$, namely $G$ and $L$, using the set $C_1$.\n\nLet's analyze the proposed condition B: $C_1 \\cap G \\neq \\emptyset$ and $C_1 \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n**Part 1: Sufficiency of Condition B**\n\nAssume condition B is true. We want to show that $X = C_0 \\cup C_1$ is path-connected.\nLet's build the space up.\nFirst, consider the set $Y_1 = G \\cup C_1$. We are given that $G$ is path-connected and $C_1$ is path-connected. By our assumption (condition B), their intersection $G \\cap C_1$ is non-empty. According to the theorem mentioned above, the union $Y_1 = G \\cup C_1$ is path-connected.\n\nNext, consider the full space $X = Y_1 \\cup L = (G \\cup C_1) \\cup L$. We just established that $Y_1$ is path-connected. The set $L$ is a line segment, so it is also path-connected. To show their union $X$ is path-connected, we need to check if their intersection is non-empty.\nThe intersection is $Y_1 \\cap L = (G \\cup C_1) \\cap L$. Using the distributive property of set operations, this is $(G \\cap L) \\cup (C_1 \\cap L)$.\nBy definition, $G$ consists of points with $x > 0$ and $L$ consists of points with $x=0$, so their intersection $G \\cap L$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\nThus, $Y_1 \\cap L = \\emptyset \\cup (C_1 \\cap L) = C_1 \\cap L$.\nOur assumption (condition B) states that $C_1 \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$.\nTherefore, the intersection of the two path-connected sets $Y_1$ and $L$ is non-empty. This guarantees that their union, $X = Y_1 \\cup L = C_0 \\cup C_1$, is path-connected.\nSo, condition B is sufficient.\n\n**Part 2: Necessity of Condition B**\n\nAssume that $X = C_0 \\cup C_1$ is path-connected. We must show that condition B must be true, given that $C_1$ is compact and path-connected.\n\nSince $X$ is path-connected, there must exist a continuous path $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to X$ connecting a point from $G$ to a point from $L$. Let $\\gamma(0) \\in G$ and $\\gamma(1) \\in L$. Let the path be given by $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_x(t), \\gamma_y(t))$.\nWe have $\\gamma_x(0) > 0$ and $\\gamma_x(1) = 0$. By continuity, there must be a first time the path hits the y-axis. Let $t_0 = \\inf \\{ t \\in [0,1] \\mid \\gamma_x(t) = 0 \\}$. By continuity of $\\gamma_x$, we have $\\gamma_x(t_0) = 0$, which implies $\\gamma(t_0) \\in L$.\nFor any time $t < t_0$, $\\gamma_x(t) > 0$. Therefore, for $t \\in [0, t_0)$, the point $\\gamma(t)$ is not in $L$. It must be in $G \\cup C_1$.\n\nNow, we use a key property of the topologist's sine curve. A path cannot continuously approach a point in $L$ if it takes values in $G$ for a sequence of times converging to the approach time. To see this, suppose there is a sequence $t_n \\to t_0^-$ such that $\\gamma(t_n) \\in G$. Then $\\gamma_x(t_n) \\to \\gamma_x(t_0) = 0^+$. The y-coordinate would be $\\gamma_y(t_n) = \\sin(\\pi / \\gamma_x(t_n))$. As $\\gamma_x(t_n) \\to 0^+$, the term $\\pi/\\gamma_x(t_n)$ goes to infinity, and $\\sin(\\pi/\\gamma_x(t_n))$ oscillates between -1 and 1 without approaching a limit. This contradicts the continuity of the path $\\gamma$, as $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\gamma(t_n)$ must exist and equal $\\gamma(t_0)$.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be false. There cannot be a sequence $t_n \\to t_0^-$ with $\\gamma(t_n) \\in G$. This means there must be some interval $(t_0 - \\delta, t_0)$ for $\\delta > 0$ where the path $\\gamma(t)$ is never in $G$. Since for $t$ in this interval, $\\gamma(t)$ is also not in $L$, it must be that for all $t \\in (t_0 - \\delta, t_0)$, $\\gamma(t) \\in C_1$.\nThe point $\\gamma(t_0)$ is a limit point of the set $\\{\\gamma(t) \\mid t \\in (t_0 - \\delta, t_0) \\} \\subset C_1$. Thus, $\\gamma(t_0) \\in \\overline{C_1}$. Since $\\gamma(t_0) \\in L$, we have shown that $\\overline{C_1} \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$. The problem states that $C_1$ is a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (a Hausdorff space), which implies $C_1$ is closed. Therefore, $C_1 = \\overline{C_1}$, and we must have $C_1 \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$. This shows one part of condition B is necessary.\n\nBy a symmetric argument, to connect a path from $L$ to $G$, the path must use $C_1$ as a bridge to avoid the same oscillation issue. A path from $l \\in L$ to $g \\in G$ must eventually leave $L$ and travel through $C_1$ before reaching $G$. Let $t_1 = \\sup\\{ t \\mid \\gamma(t) \\in L \\cup C_1 \\text{ and } \\gamma_x(t)=0 \\}$. The path must enter $G$ at some point $g_0 \\in G$. This point $g_0$ must be a limit point of the path segments in $C_1$ that precede it. Therefore, $g_0 \\in \\overline{C_1}$. Since $C_1$ is closed, this implies $g_0 \\in C_1$. So, $C_1 \\cap G \\neq \\emptyset$. Both parts of condition B are necessary.\n\nSince condition B is both sufficient and necessary, it is the minimal condition.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n*   A. $C_1 \\cap C_0 \\neq \\emptyset$: Insufficient. $C_1$ could intersect $G$ but not $L$. For example, $C_1$ could be a small compact disk entirely contained in the region $x>0$ that overlaps with $G$. The union $C_0 \\cup C_1$ would still have $L$ as a separate path-component.\n*   C. $C_1$ contains the origin $(0,0)$: This implies $C_1 \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$. However, it doesn't guarantee $C_1 \\cap G \\neq \\emptyset$. For example, $C_1$ could be a small compact disk centered at the origin that does not reach $x>0$. This is insufficient.\n*   D. $C_1 \\cap C_0$ contains infinitely many points: Insufficient. Let $C_1$ be the line segment connecting $(0.1, -1)$ and $(0.1, 1)$. This set is compact and path-connected. It intersects $G$ infinitely many times but does not intersect $L$. The union is not path-connected.\n\nThus, only condition B is both necessary and sufficient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1594518"}]}
