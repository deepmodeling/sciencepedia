Replace, in the path $\\ell$, the subsegment $[a_p,b_p]$ with a path on the sphere $S(p,r_p)$ joining $a_p$ to $b_p$.

Since $(0,1]$ is path-connected, $G$ is path-connected. Note that $P=(1,\\sin(1))\\in G\\cap L$. For any $Q\\in G$, there is a path in $G$ from $P$ to $Q$. For any $Z\\in L$, there is a path in $L$ from $Z$ to $P$.

Fix $r > 0$ and set $U_r=S\\cap B_r(0)$, where $B_r(0)$ is the open Euclidean ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin. Consider $h(t)=\\sin(1/t)-t\\sin(1)$ on $(0,1]$.

Then $C$ contains $L\\cap U_r$ and, for each large $n$, a small arc of $G\\cap U_r$ around $(t_n,t_n\\sin(1))$ (attached to $L$ at that point). However, between consecutive such intersection points along the $x$-axis there are subarcs of $G\\cap U_r$ that do not meet $L$ inside $U_r$. These subarcs are distinct connected components of $G\\cap U_r$, are disjoint from $C$, and their union accumulates at $(0,0)$. Consequently, every $S$-open neighborhood $V$ of $(0,0)$ with $V\\subset U_r$ intersects both $C$ and $U_r\\setminus C$ (because points from those disjoint $G$-components lie arbitrarily close to $(0,0)$). Since components of $U_r$ are closed in $U_r$, $V$ meets two disjoint closed sets, so $V$ cannot be connected. Therefore there is no connected open neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $S$, and $S$ is not locally connected at $(0,0)$.\n\nCombining the above: $S$ is path-connected, not compact, and not locally connected.
