This first practice explores arcwise connectedness in the context of product spaces. By analyzing the simple, hypothetical space constructed from the real line and a discrete two-point set, you will see how a lack of connection in one component can prevent the entire product from being arcwise connected, providing a clear illustration of a key theorem.
