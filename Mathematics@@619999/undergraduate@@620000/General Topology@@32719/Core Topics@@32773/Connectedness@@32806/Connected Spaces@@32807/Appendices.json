Consider the open sets in $\\mathbb{R}$: $U = (-\\infty,\\pi)$ and $V = (\\pi,\\infty)$. Then $U \\cap X_{A} = U$ and $V \\cap X_{A} = V$, so $U$ and $V$ are open in the subspace $X_{A}$.

For any $x,y \\in X_{B}$, define a path that stays in $X_{B}$ as follows. If the straight line segment from $x$ to $y$ does not pass through $(0,0)$, that segment is a continuous path in $X_{B}$. If it does, use a detour via the unit circle: write $x = r_{x} u_{x}$ and $y = r_{y} u_{y}$ with $r_{x}, r_{y} > 0$ and $u_{x}, u_{y}$ on the unit circle. Define a piecewise path $p:[0,1]\\to X_{B}$ by moving radially from $x$ to $u_{x}$, then along the unit circle from $u_{x}$ to $u_{y}$, then radially from $u_{y}$ to $y$.
