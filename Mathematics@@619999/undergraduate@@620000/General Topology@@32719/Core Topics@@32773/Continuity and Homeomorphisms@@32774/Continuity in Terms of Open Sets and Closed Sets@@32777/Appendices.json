A function $f: X \\to Y$ is continuous if for every open set $U$ in the codomain $Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in the domain $X$. To show that $f$ is not continuous, we only need to find one counterexample: an open set $U$ in the codomain $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_L)$ whose preimage is not open in the domain $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$.\n\nLet's consider a basis element for the lower limit topology $\\mathcal{T}_L$, as any basis element is by definition an open set.

For $V$ to be open in the standard topology, there must exist an open interval $(a, b)$ such that $-1 \\in (a, b)$ and $(a, b) \\subset V$. Any such open interval containing $-1$ must be of the form $(-1-\\epsilon, -1+\\delta)$ for some positive values $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$.
