For a disjoint union $X=\\coprod_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}S_{n}^{1}$, continuity of $f$ is equivalent to continuity on each component $S_{n}^{1}$, and $f$ is injective if and only if its images on distinct components are disjoint and it is injective on each component. To be an embedding, in addition, the inverse $f^{-1}:f(X)\\to X$ must be continuous; a sufficient criterion here is that the family of subspaces $\\{f(S_{n}^{1})\\}$ is pairwise disjoint and locally discrete, so that near any point of $f(S_{n}^{1})$ one can find a neighborhood intersecting no other $f(S_{m}^{1})$.\n\nOption A: $f(n,\\mathbf{u})=(3n,0)+\\mathbf{u}$. For each fixed $n$, the restriction $f|_{S_{n}^{1}}:\\mathbf{u}\\mapsto (3n,0)+\\mathbf{u}$ is a translation, hence a homeomorphism of $S^{1}$ onto the Euclidean circle of radius $1$ centered at $(3n,0)$. For $n\\neq m$, the circles have centers at distance $3|n-m|\\ge 3$ and radius $1$, so the distance between the circles is at least $3|n-m|-2\\ge 1$. Thus the images $f(S_{n}^{1})$ are pairwise disjoint and separated by a positive distance. Consequently, for any $y\\in f(S_{n}^{1})$, the open ball of radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ centered at $y$ intersects $f(X)$ only in $f(S_{n}^{1})$. If $U\\subseteq X$ is open, then $U\\cap S_{n}^{1}$ is open in $S_{n}^{1}$ for each $n$, and since $f|_{S_{n}^{1}}$ is a homeomorphism onto $f(S_{n}^{1})$, the set $f(U)\\cap f(S_{n}^{1})$ is open in $f(S_{n}^{1})$. Using the separation, for each $y\\in f(U)$, there exists an open ball $B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $B\\cap f(X)\\subseteq f(S_{n}^{1})$ and $B\\cap f(X)\\subseteq f(U)$. Hence $f(U)$ is open in $f(X)$, and the inverse $f^{-1}$ is continuous. Therefore A defines an embedding.\n\nOption B: $f(n,\\mathbf{u})=(1.5n,0)+\\mathbf{u}$. Here each $f(S_{n}^{1})$ is a unit circle centered at $(1.5n,0)$. For adjacent indices $n$ and $n+1$, the centers are at distance $1.5<2$, the sum of the radii, so the two unit circles intersect.

Take $\\varepsilon=1$ and the open ball $B$ of radius $1$ around $(3n-1,5)$. Any neighborhood of $u_{-}$ in $S^{1}$ contains points with angles $\\theta<\\pi$, whose images lie arbitrarily close to $(3n-1,0)$, at distance $5$ from $(3n-1,5)$, hence outside $B$. Therefore the preimage of $B$ is not a neighborhood of $u_{-}$, so $f|_{S_{n}^{1}}$ is not continuous at $u_{-}$. Similarly, there is a discontinuity at $u_{+}=(1,0)$, comparing $\\theta\\to 2\\pi^{-}$ with $\\theta=0$.
