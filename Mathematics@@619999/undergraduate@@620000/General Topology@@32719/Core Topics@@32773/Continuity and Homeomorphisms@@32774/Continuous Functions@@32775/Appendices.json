We must determine which property of $f$ is guaranteed.\n\nWe claim that $f$ is continuous. To prove this, it suffices to show that for every closed set $C \\subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $X$.\n\nLet $C \\subseteq Y$ be closed. Since $Y$ is compact Hausdorff, every closed subset of $Y$ is compact, hence $C$ is compact. Consider the subset $X \\times C \\subseteq X \\times Y$, which is closed because $C$ is closed.

We use the standard fact that if $C$ is compact, then $p_{X}$ maps closed subsets of $X \\times C$ to closed subsets of $X$. For completeness, we justify this: let $F \\subseteq X \\times C$ be closed and let $x_{0} \\in X \\setminus p_{X}(F)$. Then $\\{x_{0}\\} \\times C$ is disjoint from $F$. For each $c \\in C$, there exist open sets $U_{c} \\subseteq X$ with $x_{0} \\in U_{c}$ and $V_{c} \\subseteq C$ with $c \\in V_{c}$ such that $(U_{c} \\times V_{c}) \\cap F = \\varnothing$.
