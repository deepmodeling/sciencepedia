The function is continuous at $c=0$.

The function is discontinuous at $c=0$.

Since $f(y) \\ne f(z)$, the function's values jump, so it cannot be continuous.\n\nC. The function is continuous at $c=0$ because the line $y=x$ and the line $y=0$ intersect at $x=0$, which is the only point where the two rules for the function agree.\n\nD. The function is discontinuous at $c=0$. Let $V = (-0.5, 0.5)$ be a neighborhood of $f(0)=0$. For any neighborhood $U$ of $c=0$, for example $U=(-1,1)$, we can find a rational number like $y=0.75 \\in U$ for which $f(y)=0.75$, and this value is not in $V$.\n\nE. The function is continuous at $c=0$. This is because for rational numbers, the function $g(x)=x$ is continuous, and for irrational numbers, the function $h(x)=0$ is continuous. Since $x=0$ is a rational number, the continuity is determined by $g(x)$, which is continuous at $x=0$.", "solution": "We use the neighborhood definition of continuity at $c=0$.
