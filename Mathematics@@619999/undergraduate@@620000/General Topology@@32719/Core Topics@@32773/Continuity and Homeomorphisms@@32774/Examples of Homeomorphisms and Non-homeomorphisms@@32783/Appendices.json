This practice explores the classic Topologist's Sine Curve, a space that highlights the crucial subtlety between being connected and being path-connected. By analyzing why it's impossible to trace a continuous path from its oscillatory part to its limit points, we can prove it is not homeomorphic to a simple interval, thereby adding path-connectedness to our toolkit of topological invariants [@problem_id:1552348].", "problem": "In general topology, we study properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformations, known as homeomorphisms. A key method for proving that two spaces are *not* homeomorphic is to find a \"topological invariant\"—a property preserved by homeomorphisms—that one space possesses and the other does not.\n\nConsider two topological spaces, both viewed as subspaces of the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard topology. The first space is the closed unit interval, which can be represented as $I = \\{ (x, 0) \\mid x \\in [0, 1] \\}$. The second space is the Topologist's Sine Curve, denoted by $T$. This space is defined as the closure of the graph of the function $y = \\sin(1/x)$ for $x \\in (0, 1]$.

Which of the following statements identifies a topological invariant that correctly serves as the reason for this fact?\n\nA. $I$ is a compact space, but $T$ is not.\nB. $T$ is a connected space, but $I$ is not.\nC. $I$ is a path-connected space, but $T$ is not.\nD. $T$ is a Hausdorff space, but $I$ is not.\nE. $I$ and $T$ do not have the same cardinality.", "solution": "We use that a homeomorphism preserves topological invariants such as compactness, Hausdorffness, connectedness, path-connectedness, and cardinality. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they must agree on each invariant.\n\nFirst, compactness: The space $I=\\{(x,0):x\\in[0,1]\\}$ is compact because it is homeomorphic to $[0,1]$ and also a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The space\n$$\nT=\\overline{\\{(x,\\sin(1/x)):x\\in(0,1]\\}}=\\{(x,\\sin(1/x)):x\\in(0,1]\\}\\cup\\{(0,y):y\\in[-1,1]\\}\n$$\nis closed by construction and contained in $[0,1]\\times[-1,1]$, hence compact by Heine–Borel. Therefore statement A is false and does not separate $I$ and $T$.\n\nSecond, Hausdorffness: Both $I$ and $T$ are subspaces of the Hausdorff space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff. Thus D is false.\n\nThird, cardinality: Both $I$ and $T$ have cardinality of the continuum; in particular, $I$ bijects with $[0,1]$, and $T$ contains the segment $\\{(0,y):y\\in[-1,1]\\}$ of that cardinality and is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Hence E is false.\n\nFourth, connectedness: The graph $S=\\{(x,\\sin(1/x)):x\\in(0,1]\\}$ is connected because it is the continuous image of the connected set $(0,1]$ under $x\\mapsto(x,\\sin(1/x))$. The closure of a connected set is connected, so $T=\\overline{S}$ is connected. The interval $I$ is connected as well. Thus B is false and does not distinguish $I$ and $T$.\n\nFifth, path-connectedness: The set $I$ is path-connected since for any $(a,0),(b,0)\\in I$ the map $t\\mapsto((1-t)a+tb,0)$ is a path in $I$. We now show $T$ is not path-connected by proving there is no path in $T$ from any point of the vertical segment to any point with positive $x$-coordinate.\n\nAssume for contradiction that there exist $y_{0}\\in[-1,1]$ and $x_{1}\\in(0,1]$ and a continuous path $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to T$ with\n$$\n\\gamma(0)=(0,y_{0}),\\qquad \\gamma(1)=(x_{1},\\sin(1/x_{1})).\n$$\nWrite $\\gamma(t)=(u(t),v(t))$ with $u,v:[0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ continuous, so $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=x_{1}>0$. Define\n$$\nt_{0}=\\inf\\{t\\in[0,1]:u(t)>0\\}.\n$$\nBy continuity of $u$, $t_{0}\\in[0,1)$ and $u(t_{0})=0$. Fix any $\\epsilon>0$ with $t_{0}+\\epsilon\\leq 1$. The set $[t_{0},t_{0}+\\epsilon]$ is compact and connected, so $u([t_{0},t_{0}+\\epsilon])$ is a compact connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ containing $0$ and some positive value (since $u(1)>0$ and by the definition of $t_{0}$ there are points arbitrarily close to $t_{0}$ with $u>0$). Therefore there exists $\\beta>0$ such that\n$$\n[0,\\beta]\\subset u([t_{0},t_{0}+\\epsilon]).\n$$\nFor each sufficiently large integer $n$, the numbers\n$$\nx_{n}^{+}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi n+\\frac{\\pi}{2}},\\qquad x_{n}^{-}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi n+\\frac{3\\pi}{2}}\n$$\nlie in $(0,\\beta]$, hence there exist $t_{n}^{+},t_{n}^{-}\\in[t_{0},t_{0}+\\epsilon]$ with $u(t_{n}^{+})=x_{n}^{+}$ and $u(t_{n}^{-})=x_{n}^{-}$. For these parameters we have $u(t_{n}^{\\pm})>0$, hence $\\gamma(t_{n}^{\\pm})\\in T$ with positive $x$-coordinate, which forces\n$$\nv(t_{n}^{+})=\\sin(1/u(t_{n}^{+}))=\\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi n+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1,\\qquad\nv(t_{n}^{-})=\\sin(1/u(t_{n}^{-}))=\\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi n+\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)=-1.\n$$\nThus there are sequences $t_{n}^{+},t_{n}^{-}\\downarrow t_{0}$ (after passing to subsequences if necessary) with $v(t_{n}^{+})\\to 1$ and $v(t_{n}^{-})\\to -1$. Hence the right-hand limit $\\lim_{t\\downarrow t_{0}}v(t)$ does not exist. This contradicts continuity of $v$ at $t_{0}$, which requires $\\lim_{t\\downarrow t_{0}}v(t)=v(t_{0})=y_{0}$.\n\nTherefore no path in $T$ connects a point with $x=0$ to a point with $x>0$, and $T$ is not path-connected. Since path-connectedness is a topological invariant, this distinguishes $I$ and $T$.\n\nConsequently, the correct invariant identifying why $I$ and $T$ are not homeomorphic is that $I$ is path-connected whereas $T$ is not, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1552348"}, {"introduction": "After mastering techniques for proving spaces are different, it is equally important to recognize when they are the same in a topological sense, even if they appear geometrically different.

Thus $g=f^{-1}$ set-theoretically.\n\nWe prove $g$ is continuous. On $C\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, $g(x,y)=\\frac{y}{x}$ is the restriction of a quotient of continuous functions with $x>0$ on $C\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, hence continuous there.
