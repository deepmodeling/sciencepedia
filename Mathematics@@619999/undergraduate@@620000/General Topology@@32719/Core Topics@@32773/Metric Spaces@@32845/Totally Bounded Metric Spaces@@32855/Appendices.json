For $d_{A}(x,y)=d_{1}(x,y)+d_{2}(x,y)$:\n1) Metric verification:\n- Nonnegativity and symmetry are immediate from those of $d_{1},d_{2}$.\n- Identity of indiscernibles: If $d_{A}(x,y)=0$ then $d_{1}(x,y)+d_{2}(x,y)=0$, hence $d_{1}(x,y)=0$ and $d_{2}(x,y)=0$, so $x=y$.\n- Triangle inequality: For all $x,y,z\\in X$,\n$$\nd_{A}(x,z)=d_{1}(x,z)+d_{2}(x,z)\\leq\\left[d_{1}(x,y)+d_{1}(y,z)\\right]+\\left[d_{2}(x,y)+d_{2}(y,z)\\right]=d_{A}(x,y)+d_{A}(y,z).\n$$\nThus $d_{A}$ is a metric.\n\n2) Total boundedness:\nFix $\\epsilon>0$. Since $(X,d_{1})$ and $(X,d_{2})$ are totally bounded, there exist finite sets $S_{1}=\\{a_{1},\\dots,a_{m}\\}$ and $S_{2}=\\{b_{1},\\dots,b_{n}\\}$ that are finite $\\epsilon/2$-nets for their respective spaces. For any $x \\in X$, there is an $a_i \\in S_1$ with $d_1(x,a_i) < \\epsilon/2$ and a $b_j \\in S_2$ with $d_2(x,b_j) < \\epsilon/2$. This on its own isn't sufficient. A better approach is to create a finer cover.\nSince $(X,d_{1})$ and $(X,d_{2})$ are totally bounded, we can find finite $\\epsilon/2$-nets for each. Let $F_1$ be an $\\epsilon/2$-net for $(X, d_1)$ and $F_2$ be an $\\epsilon/2$-net for $(X, d_2)$. Now, consider the finite set of intersections $\\{ B_{d_1}(p, \\epsilon/2) \\cap B_{d_2}(q, \\epsilon/2) \\mid p \\in F_1, q \\in F_2 \\}$. This collection of sets covers $X$. From each non-empty set in this collection, pick one point to form a new finite set $F$. For any point $x \\in X$, it must belong to some $B_{d_1}(p, \\epsilon/2) \\cap B_{d_2}(q, \\epsilon/2)$. Let $t$ be the point chosen from this intersection for our set $F$. By the triangle inequality, $d_1(x, t) \\le d_1(x, p) + d_1(p, t) < \\epsilon/2 + \\epsilon/2 = \\epsilon$. Similarly, $d_2(x, t) \\le d_2(x, q) + d_2(q, t) < \\epsilon/2 + \\epsilon/2 = \\epsilon$. Therefore, $d_A(x, t) = d_1(x, t) + d_2(x, t) < \\epsilon + \\epsilon = 2\\epsilon$.\nTo be more precise, let's pick $\\epsilon/4$-nets. Then $d_1(x, t) < \\epsilon/2$ and $d_2(x, t) < \\epsilon/2$. So, $d_A(x, t)  \\epsilon$. The finite set $F$ is an $\\epsilon$-net for $(X, d_A)$. Hence, $(X, d_A)$ is totally bounded.\n\nB. For $d_{B}(x,y)=\\max\\{d_{1}(x,y),d_{2}(x,y)\\}$:\n1) Metric verification:\n- Nonnegativity and symmetry are immediate.\n- Identity: $\\max\\{d_{1}(x,y),d_{2}(x,y)\\}=0$ implies $d_{1}(x,y)=d_{2}(x,y)=0$, so $x=y$.\n- Triangle inequality: For all $x,y,z\\in X$,\n$$\nd_{1}(x,z)\\leq d_{1}(x,y)+d_{1}(y,z)\\leq \\max\\{d_{1}(x,y),d_{2}(x,y)\\}+\\max\\{d_{1}(y,z),d_{2}(y,z)\\},\n$$\nand the same bound holds for $d_{2}(x,z)$. Taking the maximum of the two left-hand quantities yields\n$$\nd_{B}(x,z)\\leq d_{B}(x,y)+d_{B}(y,z).\n$$\nThus $d_{B}$ is a metric.\n\n2) Total boundedness:\nFor all $x,y$, we have $d_{B}(x,y)\\leq d_{A}(x,y)$. As shown in part A, $(X, d_A)$ is totally bounded. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, there is a finite $\\epsilon$-net $F$ for $(X, d_A)$. For any $x \\in X$, there exists a $p \\in F$ such that $d_A(x,p)  \\epsilon$. This implies $d_B(x,p) \\leq d_A(x,p)  \\epsilon$. Thus, $F$ is also a finite $\\epsilon$-net for $(X, d_B)$, which means $(X, d_B)$ is totally bounded.\n\nD. For $d_{D}(x,y)=\\sqrt{d_{1}(x,y)^{2}+d_{2}(x,y)^{2}}$:\n1) Metric verification:\n- Nonnegativity, symmetry, and identity are clear since $d_{D}(x,y)=0$ iff $d_{1}(x,y)=d_{2}(x,y)=0$.\n- Triangle inequality: Let $a=(d_{1}(x,y),d_{2}(x,y))$ and $b=(d_{1}(y,z),d_{2}(y,z))$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Using the triangle inequality for the Euclidean norm and the triangle inequality for $d_1$ and $d_2$,\n$$\nd_{D}(x,z)=\\|(d_{1}(x,z),d_{2}(x,z))\\|_{2}\\leq\\|(d_{1}(x,y)+d_{1}(y,z),\\,d_{2}(x,y)+d_{2}(y,z))\\|_{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\leq\\|(d_1(x,y), d_2(x,y))\\|_2 + \\|(d_1(y,z), d_2(y,z))\\|_2 = d_{D}(x,y)+d_{D}(y,z).\n$$\nThus $d_{D}$ is a metric.\n\n2) Total boundedness:\nFor all $x,y$, we have $d_{D}(x,y)\\leq d_{A}(x,y)$, since $\\sqrt{u^{2}+v^{2}}\\leq u+v$ for $u,v\\geq 0$. The same argument as for Part B applies: any finite $\\epsilon$-net for $(X, d_A)$ is also a finite $\\epsilon$-net for $(X, d_D)$. Therefore, $(X, d_D)$ is totally bounded.\n\nC. For $d_{C}(x,y)=\\min\\{d_{1}(x,y),d_{2}(x,y)\\}$:\nThis function is not necessarily a metric. Consider $X=\\{0,1,2\\}$ with metrics $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ defined by\n$$\nd_{1}(0,1)=1,\\quad d_{1}(1,2)=100,\\quad d_{1}(0,2)=101,\n$$\n$$\nd_{2}(0,1)=100,\\quad d_{2}(1,2)=1,\\quad d_{2}(0,2)=101,\n$$\nand $d_{i}(x,x)=0$, $d_{i}(x,y)=d_{i}(y,x)$ for all $x,y$. Both $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ satisfy the triangle inequality (each equality case above is tight), and since $X$ is finite, both $(X,d_{1})$ and $(X,d_{2})$ are totally bounded. However,\n$$\nd_{C}(0,1)=\\min\\{1,100\\}=1,\\quad d_{C}(1,2)=\\min\\{100,1\\}=1,\\quad d_{C}(0,2)=\\min\\{101,101\\}=101,\n$$\nso\n$$\nd_{C}(0,2)=1011+1=d_{C}(0,1)+d_{C}(1,2),\n$$\nviolating the triangle inequality. Therefore $d_{C}$ is not necessarily a metric and hence $(X,d_{C})$ is not necessarily totally bounded.\n\nE. For $d_{E}(x,y)=|d_{1}(x,y)-d_{2}(x,y)|$:\nThis function is not necessarily a metric. For example, if $d_{1}=d_{2}$ (which is permitted, and each is totally bounded), then for any $x\\neq y$ we have $d_{E}(x,y)=0$, violating identity of indiscernibles. Hence $d_{E}$ is not necessarily a metric and thus $(X,d_{E})$ is not necessarily totally bounded.\n\nCombining the above, the necessarily totally bounded metric spaces among the listed constructions are $(X,d_{A})$, $(X,d_{B})$, and $(X,d_{D})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "1592895"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from abstract properties to a concrete application in the space of continuous functions, $C[0,1]$.
