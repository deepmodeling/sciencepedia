For $z=f(x)$ we have\n$$\n|z|=\\frac{|x|}{1+|x|}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad |z|(1+|x|)=|x|\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad |x|=\\frac{|z|}{1-|z|}.\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{sgn}(z)=\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$, it follows that\n$$\ng(z)=\\frac{z}{1-|z|}\n$$\nsatisfies $g(f(x))=x$ and $f(g(z))=z$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $z\\in(-1,1)$. Hence $f$ is a bijection with inverse $g$.\n\nNext, analyze continuity. The map $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ as a composition of continuous functions. For $g$, note that\n$$\ng(z)=\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{z}{1-z}, & z\\in[0,1),\\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{z}{1+z}, & z\\in(-1,0],\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhich is continuous on $(-1,1)$ and the two expressions agree at $z=0$.
