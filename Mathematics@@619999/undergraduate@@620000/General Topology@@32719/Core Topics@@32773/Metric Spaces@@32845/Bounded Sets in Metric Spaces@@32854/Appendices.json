We analyze each option.\n\nFor A: The metric space $\\mathbb{Q}$ with $d(x,y)=|x-y|$ is not complete, because there exists a Cauchy sequence of rationals converging in $\\mathbb{R}$ to an irrational number (for example, a rational sequence converging to $\\sqrt{2}$), which has no limit in $\\mathbb{Q}$. However, every bounded sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$ has a Cauchy subsequence. Indeed, let $(q_{n})$ be bounded in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Viewed as a sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the same metric, the Bolzanoâ€“Weierstrass theorem guarantees a convergent subsequence $(q_{n_{k}})$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.

Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}$ does not contain a bounded sequence with no Cauchy subsequence. Hence A does not satisfy the simultaneous condition.\n\nFor B: The space $C[0,1]$ with the supremum metric is complete. If $(f_{n})$ is Cauchy in the sup norm, then it is uniformly Cauchy and thus converges uniformly to some $f$. The uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous, hence $f \\in C[0,1]$, so $C[0,1]$ is complete. Therefore B cannot be the desired space.\n\nFor C: The space $c_{00}$ with the supremum metric is not complete. To see this, define the sequence $y=(y_{i})_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ by $y_{i}=\\frac{1}{i}$. This sequence converges to 0, so it is in the space $c_0$, but it is not in $c_{00}$ because it has infinitely many non-zero terms.

Thus $c_{00}$ is not complete. Furthermore, $c_{00}$ contains a bounded sequence with no Cauchy subsequence: let $e_{n}$ be the sequence with $1$ in the $n$-th coordinate and $0$ elsewhere.
