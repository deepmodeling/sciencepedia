A fundamental principle is: if a metric space $(X,d)$ is complete and $Y \\subseteq X$, then the metric subspace $Y$ is complete if and only if $Y$ is a closed set in $X$. Proof sketch: if $Y$ is closed and a sequence $(y_n)$ is Cauchy in $Y$, then it is Cauchy in $X$ and converges in $X$ to some point $y$. Since $Y$ is closed, $y \\in Y$, so $Y$ is complete. Conversely, if $Y$ is complete, then every sequence in $Y$ that converges in $X$ must converge to a point in $Y$, which implies $Y$ is closed.\n\nWe apply this to each subset.\n\nA. $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$. Indeed, if $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$, let $n=\\lfloor x \\rfloor$; then $\\min\\{|x-n|,|x-(n+1)|\\} > 0$, so the open ball about $x$ with radius $\\frac{1}{2}\\min\\{|x-n|,|x-(n+1)|\\}$ misses $\\mathbb{Z}$.
