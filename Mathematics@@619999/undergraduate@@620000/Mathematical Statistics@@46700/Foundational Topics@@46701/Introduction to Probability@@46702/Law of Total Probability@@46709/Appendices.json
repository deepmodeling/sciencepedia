Imagine you are a manager for a retailer who sources products from different suppliers; to understand the overall quality of your inventory, you must calculate an aggregate metric.

The retailer's inventory of the Helios S1 consists of 70% units from Plant A and 30% from Plant B. Through extensive quality control analysis, it is known that smartphones from Plant A have a 1.2% probability of containing a specific battery defect. Smartphones from Plant B, using a slightly different manufacturing process, have a 3.5% probability of having the same battery defect. A customer purchases one of these Helios S1 smartphones at random from the retailer's inventory.\n\nCalculate the total probability that the purchased smartphone has a battery defect. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $D$ be the event that a randomly selected smartphone has a battery defect. Let $A$ be the event that the smartphone was assembled in Plant A, and let $B$ be the event that the smartphone was assembled in Plant B. The events $A$ and $B$ form a partition of the sample space, as every smartphone in the retailer's inventory comes from one of these two plants.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can extract the following probabilities:\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen phone is from Plant A is given as 70%, which can be written as:\n$$P(A) = 0.70$$\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen phone is from Plant B is given as 30%:\n$$P(B) = 0.30$$\nNote that $P(A) + P(B) = 0.70 + 0.30 = 1.0$, as expected for a partition.\n\nThe conditional probability that a phone has a defect, given that it came from Plant A, is 1.2%:\n$$P(D|A) = 0.012$$\n\nThe conditional probability that a phone has a defect, given that it came from Plant B, is 3.5%:\n$$P(D|B) = 0.035$$\n\nTo find the total probability of a randomly selected phone having a defect, $P(D)$, we use the Law of Total Probability. The formula is:\n$$P(D) = P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into this equation:\n$$P(D) = (0.012)(0.70) + (0.035)(0.30)$$\n\nWe perform the multiplications for each term:\nThe contribution to the total probability from Plant A's defective units is:\n$$(0.012)(0.70) = 0.0084$$\nThe contribution to the total probability from Plant B's defective units is:\n$$(0.035)(0.30) = 0.0105$$\n\nFinally, we sum these two values to find the total probability of a defect:\n$$P(D) = 0.0084 + 0.0105 = 0.0189$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.0189$. The first significant figure is 1, the second is 8, and the third is 9.
