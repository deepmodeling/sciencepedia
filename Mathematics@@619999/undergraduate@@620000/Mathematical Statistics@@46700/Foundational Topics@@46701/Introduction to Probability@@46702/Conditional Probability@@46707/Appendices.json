The definition of conditional probability for events $A$ and $B$ in a sample space is:\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\nwhere $P(A \\cap B)$ is the probability of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring, and $P(B)$ is the probability of event $B$ occurring, with $P(B) > 0$.\n\nFor problems with a finite number of equally likely outcomes, this can be calculated as the ratio of the number of outcomes in the intersection of the events to the number of outcomes in the conditioning event:\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|B|}\n$$\n\nFirst, let's define the sample space, $S$. The experiment involves rolling two six-sided dice. The outcome can be represented by an ordered pair $(d_1, d_2)$, where $d_1$ is the result of the first die and $d_2$ is the result of the second die. Each die can show a number from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nThe total number of possible outcomes is $|S| = 6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nNext, let's identify the set of outcomes corresponding to event $B$, where the sum of the dice is 8.\n$$\nB = \\{(d_1, d_2) | d_1 + d_2 = 8\\}\n$$\nListing the pairs:\n$B = \\{(2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)\\}$\nThe number of outcomes in event $B$ is $|B| = 5$.\n\nNow, let's identify the set of outcomes for the intersection event $A \\cap B$. This event corresponds to outcomes where the sum is 8 AND at least one of the dice shows a 5. We can find these by inspecting the set $B$.\n$$\nA \\cap B = \\{(d_1, d_2) \\in B | d_1 = 5 \\text{ or } d_2 = 5\\}\n$$\nFrom the set $B$, the outcomes that satisfy this condition are:\n$A \\cap B = \\{(3, 5), (5, 3)\\}$\nThe number of outcomes in the intersection event $A \\cap B$ is $|A \\cap B| = 2$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the conditional probability $P(A|B)$ using the formula for equally likely outcomes. We are given that event B has occurred, so our new, reduced sample space is the set $B$ itself, which has 5 outcomes. Out of these 5 possible outcomes, 2 of them satisfy the condition for event A.\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|B|}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{2}{5}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}\n$$", "id": "3049"}, {"introduction": "Moving from discrete counting to practical inference, this problem explores a common scenario in industrial quality control.

A microchip can be defective in two mutually exclusive ways: it was produced by Line A and is defective, or it was produced by Line B and is defective. Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(D)$ as the sum of these possibilities:\n$$\nP(D) = P(D \\cap A) + P(D \\cap B)\n$$\nWe have already found $P(D \\cap A) = d_A p_A$.
