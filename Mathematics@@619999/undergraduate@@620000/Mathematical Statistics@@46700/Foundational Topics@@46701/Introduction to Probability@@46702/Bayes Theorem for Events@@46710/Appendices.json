Based on historical data, junior developers are responsible for 35% of all code commits, while senior developers are responsible for the remaining 65%. An automated testing system, known as the build pipeline, analyzes every commit. The system has determined that a code commit made by a junior developer has an 8.0% probability of causing a pipeline failure. In contrast, a commit from a senior developer has only a 2.0% probability of causing such a failure.\n\nSuppose a new commit is pushed to the repository, and it results in a pipeline failure.

The scenario of authenticating a painting highlights how even a single piece of evidence from an imperfect test can dramatically and quantifiably alter our confidence in an outcome.

Based on the style, provenance, and initial visual inspection, the historian's prior assessment is that there is a 95% chance the painting is authentic. Consequently, there is a 5% chance it is a later forgery.\n\nTo verify the painting's age, a chemical test is performed on a microscopic sample. The test is designed to detect the presence of \"Prussian Blue,\" a pigment that was not invented until the early 18th century. An authentic 16th-century painting would therefore contain no Prussian Blue. The testing procedure has been extensively calibrated. It is known that if Prussian Blue is present (as it would be in a forgery of this type), the test will fail to detect it (a false negative) with a probability of 0.02. Conversely, if Prussian Blue is absent (as in an authentic painting), the test will correctly report its absence with a probability of 1.0.\n\nThe test is conducted, and the result is negative, meaning no Prussian Blue was detected.\n\nGiven this new evidence, what is the updated probability that the painting is authentic?
