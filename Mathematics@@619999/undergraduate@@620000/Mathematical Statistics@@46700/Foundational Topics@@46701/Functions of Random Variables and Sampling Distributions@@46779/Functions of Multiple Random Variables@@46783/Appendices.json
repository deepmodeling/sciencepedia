The possible values of $Y$ are $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$. Because there are $36$ equally likely ordered outcomes for $(X_{1},X_{2})$, we compute $P(Y=k)$ by counting the number $N_{k}$ of ordered pairs with $|X_{1}-X_{2}|=k$ and using $P(Y=k)=\\frac{N_{k}}{36}$.\n\nFor $k=0$, we must have $X_{1}=X_{2}$, giving $N_{0}=6$ pairs. For $k \\geq 1$, the pairs are $(i,i+k)$ with $i=1,\\ldots,6-k$ and $(i+k,i)$ with $i=1,\\ldots,6-k$, so $N_{k}=2(6-k)$ for $k=1,2,3,4,5$.\n\nThe expected value is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y]=\\sum_{k=0}^{5} k\\,P(Y=k)=\\frac{1}{36}\\sum_{k=0}^{5} k\\,N_{k}\n=\\frac{1}{36}\\left(0\\cdot 6+\\sum_{k=1}^{5} k\\cdot 2(6-k)\\right).\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y]=\\frac{2}{36}\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\left(6k-k^{2}\\right)\n=\\frac{1}{18}\\left(6\\sum_{k=1}^{5} k-\\sum_{k=1}^{5} k^{2}\\right).\n$$\nUsing the summation formulas $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{2}=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ with $n=5$, we get $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} k=\\frac{5\\cdot 6}{2}=15$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} k^{2}=\\frac{5\\cdot 6\\cdot 11}{6}=55$.
