We want to find $E[S]$.\nUsing the law of total expectation, we condition on the position of the first break, $X$:\n$$E[S] = E[E[S|X]] = \\int_{0}^{L} E[S|X=x] f_X(x) dx = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} E[S|X=x] dx$$\nThe problem has symmetry around $X=L/2$. The conditional expectation $E[S|X=x]$ will have the same value as $E[S|X=L-x]$. Thus, we can write:\n$$E[S] = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{L/2}^{L} E[S|X=x] dx$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the conditional expectation $E[S|X=x]$ for $x \\in (L/2, L)$.\nIf $X=x$ where $x \\in (L/2, L)$, the first two pieces have lengths $x$ and $L-x$. The longer piece has length $x$ and the shorter has length $L-x$. The second break is performed on the piece of length $x$. Let $Y$ be a random variable for the length of one of the segments from this second break. $Y$ is uniformly distributed on $(0, x)$. The two segments from this break have lengths $Y$ and $x-Y$.\nThe three resulting pieces have lengths $L-x$, $Y$, and $x-Y$.\nThe conditional expectation of the smallest piece length, given $X=x$, is:\n$$E[S|X=x] = E_Y[\\min(L-x, Y, x-Y)]$$\nwhere the expectation is over $Y \\sim U(0, x)$. Let $c = L-x$.\n$$E[S|X=x] = \\frac{1}{x} \\int_0^x \\min(c, y, x-y) dy$$\nThe term $\\min(y, x-y)$ is symmetric about $y=x/2$.

The comparison point is determined by whether $c$ is greater or smaller than the maximum value of $y$, which is $x/2$.\nThe condition is $L-x > x/2$, which simplifies to $L > 3x/2$, or $x < 2L/3$.\n\nCase 1: $x \\in (L/2, 2L/3)$.\nIn this interval, $L-x > x/2$. For any $y \\in (0, x/2)$, we have $y < x/2 < L-x = c$.
