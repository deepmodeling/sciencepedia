The first quartile of this distribution, denoted as $Q_1$, is defined as the value such that the probability $P(X \\le Q_1)$ is exactly $0.25$. Determine a general expression for the first quartile, $Q_1$, in terms of the interval endpoints $a$ and $b$.", "solution": "Let $X$ be a continuous random variable that follows a uniform distribution on the interval $[a, b]$. The probability density function (PDF) for $X$, denoted by $f(x)$, is constant over this interval and zero elsewhere. The value of this constant is determined by the condition that the total probability must integrate to 1.\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b-a} & \\text{if } a \\le x \\le b \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF), denoted by $F(x)$, gives the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on a value less than or equal to $x$, i.e., $F(x) = P(X \\le x)$. The CDF is found by integrating the PDF from the lower limit of the distribution's support up to $x$. For any $x$ within the interval $[a, b]$, the CDF is calculated as:\n$$ F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(t) \\,dt = \\int_{a}^{x} \\frac{1}{b-a} \\,dt $$\nPerforming the integration, we get:\n$$ F(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} [t]_{a}^{x} = \\frac{x-a}{b-a} $$\nSo, the CDF for $x \\in [a, b]$ is $F(x) = \\frac{x-a}{b-a}$. The full definition of the CDF is:\n$$ F(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } x < a \\\\ \\frac{x-a}{b-a} & \\text{if } a \\le x \\le b \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } x > b \\end{cases} $$\nThe first quartile, $Q_1$, is the value in the distribution's support for which the CDF is equal to $0.25$. In other words, we need to find the value $Q_1$ such that $F(Q_1) = 0.25$. Since $0 < 0.25 < 1$, the value of $Q_1$ must lie within the interval $[a, b]$. Therefore, we can use the expression for the CDF on this interval:\n$$ F(Q_1) = \\frac{Q_1 - a}{b-a} = 0.25 $$\nWe can also write $0.25$ as the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1 - a}{b-a} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nNow, we solve this equation for $Q_1$. Multiply both sides by $(b-a)$:\n$$ Q_1 - a = \\frac{1}{4}(b-a) $$\nAdd $a$ to both sides to isolate $Q_1$:\n$$ Q_1 = a + \\frac{1}{4}(b-a) $$\nTo simplify the expression, we can distribute the $\\frac{1}{4}$ and combine terms:\n$$ Q_1 = a + \\frac{1}{4}b - \\frac{1}{4}a $$\n$$ Q_1 = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)a + \\frac{1}{4}b $$\n$$ Q_1 = \\frac{3}{4}a + \\frac{1}{4}b $$\nFinally, we can write this as a single fraction:\n$$ Q_1 = \\frac{3a + b}{4} $$\nThis expression gives the first quartile for any uniform distribution on the interval $[a, b]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3a+b}{4}}$$", "id": "1949225"}, {"introduction": "Beyond direct calculation, a deep understanding of quantiles involves leveraging the properties of probability distributions. This exercise [@problem_id:1949166] explores the powerful implications of symmetry, a common feature in many statistical models.

Express your final answer in kPa.", "solution": "Let $X$ be the random variable representing the atmospheric pressure reading. We are given that the distribution of $X$ is continuous and symmetric about its mean, $\\mu = 101.3$ kPa.\n\nLet $p_{\\alpha}$ denote the $\\alpha$-th percentile of the distribution. By definition, the $\\alpha$-th percentile is the value $x$ such that the probability of the random variable being less than or equal to $x$ is $\\frac{\\alpha}{100}$. That is, $P(X \\le p_{\\alpha}) = \\frac{\\alpha}{100}$.\n\nWe are given that the 15th percentile is $98.8$ kPa. This can be written as:\n$$P(X \\le 98.8) = 0.15$$\n\nWe are asked to find the 85th percentile, which we will denote as $p_{85}$. This is the value such that:\n$$P(X \\le p_{85}) = 0.85$$\n\nThe property of a symmetric distribution is central to this problem. For a distribution symmetric about its mean $\\mu$, the probability density function $f(x)$ satisfies $f(\\mu - c) = f(\\mu + c)$ for any constant $c$. This implies the following relationship for the cumulative distribution function $F(x) = P(X \\le x)$:\n$$P(X \\le \\mu - c) = P(X \\ge \\mu + c)$$\n\nLet's use this property. We know the 15th percentile, $p_{15} = 98.8$. The distance of this percentile from the mean $\\mu$ is:\n$$c = \\mu - p_{15} = 101.3 - 98.8 = 2.5$$\nSo, we can express the 15th percentile as $p_{15} = \\mu - c = 101.3 - 2.5$. The given information can be restated as:\n$$P(X \\le 101.3 - 2.5) = 0.15$$\n\nNow, using the symmetry property $P(X \\le \\mu - c) = P(X \\ge \\mu + c)$, we have:\n$$P(X \\ge 101.3 + 2.5) = 0.15$$\n$$P(X \\ge 103.8) = 0.15$$\n\nRecall that we are looking for $p_{85}$, the value for which $P(X \\le p_{85}) = 0.85$. Using the complement rule for probability, we can write:\n$$P(X \\le p_{85}) = 1 - P(X > p_{85}) = 0.85$$\nThis implies:\n$$P(X > p_{85}) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\n\nSince the distribution is continuous, the probability of $X$ being exactly equal to any single value is zero, so $P(X > x) = P(X \\ge x)$. Therefore:\n$$P(X \\ge p_{85}) = 0.15$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for the same probability:\n1. From symmetry: $P(X \\ge 103.8) = 0.15$\n2. From the definition of the 85th percentile: $P(X \\ge p_{85}) = 0.15$\n\nBy comparing these two equations, we can conclude that:\n$$p_{85} = 103.8$$\n\nThe 85th percentile of the distribution is $103.8$ kPa.
