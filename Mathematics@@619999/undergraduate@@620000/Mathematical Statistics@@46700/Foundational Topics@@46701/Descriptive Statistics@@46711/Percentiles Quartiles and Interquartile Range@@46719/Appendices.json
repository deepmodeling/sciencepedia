Robustness, in this context, refers to a measure's resistance to being affected by extreme values or outliers. The scientist considers an initial dataset of five measurements:\n$$ D_A = \\{12, 44, 25, 40, 31\\} $$\nDue to a sensor malfunction, the single largest measurement is erroneously recorded as a much larger value, resulting in a new dataset:\n$$ D_B = \\{12, 250, 25, 40, 31\\} $$\n\nThe analysis uses a specific method for calculating quartiles. For any sorted dataset of size $n$:\n- The second quartile ($Q_2$), or median, is the middle value of the dataset.\n- The first quartile ($Q_1$) is the median of the lower half of the data. If $n$ is odd, the overall median ($Q_2$) is included in this lower half.\n- The third quartile ($Q_3$) is the median of the upper half of the data. If $n$ is odd, the overall median ($Q_2$) is also included in this upper half.\n\nThe Interquartile Range (IQR) is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$, and the range is defined as the maximum value minus the minimum value.\n\nTo quantify the effect of the outlier, calculate the absolute difference between the range of dataset $D_B$ and the range of dataset $D_A$.
