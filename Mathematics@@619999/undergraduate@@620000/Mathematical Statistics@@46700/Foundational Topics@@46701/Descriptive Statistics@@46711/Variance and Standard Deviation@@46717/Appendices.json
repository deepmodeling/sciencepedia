This is the conditional variance, denoted as $Var(S | H=5)$.\n\nThe formula for the variance of a random variable $X$ is $Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. In our case, we need to compute the conditional expectations $E[S | H=5]$ and $E[S^2 | H=5]$. To do this, we first need to find the conditional probability mass function (PMF) of $S$ given $H=5$, which is $P(S=s | H=5)$.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is $P(S=s | H=5) = \\frac{P(S=s, H=5)}{P(H=5)}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the marginal probability $P(H=5)$ by summing the joint probabilities over all possible values of $S$ when $H=5$:\n$$P(H=5) = \\sum_{s} p(5, s) = p(5, 70) + p(5, 80) + p(5, 90)$$\n$$P(H=5) = 0.05 + 0.25 + 0.20 = 0.50$$\n\nNext, we find the conditional probabilities for each value of $S$ given $H=5$:\n$$P(S=70 | H=5) = \\frac{p(5, 70)}{P(H=5)} = \\frac{0.05}{0.50} = 0.1$$\n$$P(S=80 | H=5) = \\frac{p(5, 80)}{P(H=5)} = \\frac{0.25}{0.50} = 0.5$$\n$$P(S=90 | H=5) = \\frac{p(5, 90)}{P(H=5)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.50} = 0.4$$\nAs a check, the sum of these conditional probabilities is $0.1 + 0.5 + 0.4 = 1.0$, as expected for a valid PMF.\n\nNow, we can compute the conditional expectation of $S$ given $H=5$:\n$$E[S | H=5] = \\sum_{s} s \\cdot P(S=s | H=5)$$\n$$E[S | H=5] = (70)(0.1) + (80)(0.5) + (90)(0.4)$$\n$$E[S | H=5] = 7 + 40 + 36 = 83$$\n\nNext, we compute the conditional expectation of $S^2$ given $H=5$:\n$$E[S^2 | H=5] = \\sum_{s} s^2 \\cdot P(S=s | H=5)$$\n$$E[S^2 | H=5] = (70^2)(0.1) + (80^2)(0.5) + (90^2)(0.4)$$\n$$E[S^2 | H=5] = (4900)(0.1) + (6400)(0.5) + (8100)(0.4)$$\n$$E[S^2 | H=5] = 490 + 3200 + 3240 = 6930$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the conditional variance using the formula $Var(S | H=5) = E[S^2 | H=5] - (E[S | H=5])^2$:\n$$Var(S | H=5) = 6930 - (83)^2$$\nWe calculate $83^2$:\n$$83^2 = 6889$$\nSubstituting this back into the variance formula:\n$$Var(S | H=5) = 6930 - 6889 = 41$$\n\nThe variance of the exam score for students who studied for exactly 5 hours is 41 scores squared.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{41}$$", "id": "1966789"}, {"introduction": "The way we collect data directly influences the statistical properties of our sample.
