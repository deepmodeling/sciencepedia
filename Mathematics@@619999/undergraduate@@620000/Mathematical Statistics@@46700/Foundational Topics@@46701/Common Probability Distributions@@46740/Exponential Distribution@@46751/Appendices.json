The lifetime $T$ of a single atom of this isotope is found to be well-described by a random variable following an exponential distribution. Through repeated measurements, the mean lifetime of an atom is determined to be 12.3 years. A specific atom is isolated for study. After 7.8 years, a check reveals that this atom has not yet decayed. What is the expected remaining lifetime of this particular atom, from this point forward?\n\nExpress your answer in years, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the random variable $T$ represent the lifetime of an atom of the radioactive isotope. The problem states that $T$ follows an exponential distribution. Let the rate parameter of this distribution be $\\lambda$. The probability density function (PDF) for $T$ is given by $f(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe mean, or expected value, of an exponentially distributed random variable is given by $E[T] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\nWe are given that the mean lifetime is 12.3 years.\n$$E[T] = 12.3 \\, \\text{years}$$\nTherefore, the rate parameter is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{12.3} \\, \\text{years}^{-1}$.\n\nWe are asked to find the expected remaining lifetime of an atom that has already survived for 7.8 years. This is a conditional expectation problem. Let $t_0 = 7.8$ years. We need to calculate the expected value of the remaining lifetime, $T - t_0$, given that the atom has survived past time $t_0$, i.e., $T > t_0$. The quantity we need to find is $E[T - t_0 | T > t_0]$.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to use the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. The memoryless property states that for any $s > 0$ and $t > 0$:\n$$P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t)$$\nIn words, the probability that the atom survives for an additional time $t$, given that it has already survived for time $s$, is the same as the probability that a brand new atom survives for time $t$. The distribution \"forgets\" how long the atom has already existed.\n\nThis property has a direct consequence for conditional expectation. The distribution of the remaining lifetime, $T - s$, given that $T > s$, is the same as the original distribution of $T$. Therefore, the expected remaining lifetime is equal to the original unconditional expected lifetime.\n$$E[T - s | T > s] = E[T]$$\n\nIn our problem, the time already survived is $s = t_0 = 7.8$ years. The original mean lifetime is $E[T] = 12.3$ years. Applying the memoryless property:\n$$E[T - 7.8 | T > 7.8] = E[T]$$\nSince $E[T] = 12.3$ years, the expected remaining lifetime is 12.3 years.\n\nThe information that the atom has already survived for 7.8 years does not change its expected future lifetime. This is a defining and counter-intuitive feature of processes modeled by the exponential distribution.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in years, rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is 12.3 years, which is already expressed to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.3}$$", "id": "1397637"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its theoretical properties, the exponential distribution is a powerful tool for calculating the likelihood of events over time.
