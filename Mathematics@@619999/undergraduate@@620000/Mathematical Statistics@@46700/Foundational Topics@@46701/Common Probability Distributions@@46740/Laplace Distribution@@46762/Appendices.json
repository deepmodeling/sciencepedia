If we find the PDF of $Y$, say $f_Y(y)$, the PDF of $X$ can be found by a simple shift: $f_X(x) = f_Y(x-\\mu)$.\n\nOur main task is to find the PDF of $Y$. Let's define an intermediate random variable $V = \\frac{U_1}{U_2}$. Then $Y = b \\ln(V)$. We will first find the distribution of $V$. Since $U_1, U_2 \\in (0, 1)$, the range of $V$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nWe find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $V$, $F_V(v) = P(V \\leq v) = P(U_1/U_2 \\leq v)$. Since $U_2$ is always positive, this is equivalent to $P(U_1 \\leq v U_2)$.\nThe joint PDF of $U_1$ and $U_2$ is $f_{U_1, U_2}(u_1, u_2) = 1$ for $0 < u_1 < 1$ and $0 < u_2 < 1$, and 0 otherwise. The probability $P(U_1 \\leq v U_2)$ is the area of the region defined by $0 < u_1 < 1$, $0 < u_2 < 1$, and $u_1 \\leq v u_2$, within the unit square in the $u_1-u_2$ plane. We consider two cases for the value of $v$.\n\nCase 1: $0 < v \\leq 1$.\nWe compute the area by integrating the joint PDF over the specified region:\n$F_V(v) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 I(u_1 \\leq v u_2) \\,du_1 \\,du_2$, where $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.\n$F_V(v) = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\int_0^{\\min(1, v u_2)} 1 \\,du_1\\right) \\,du_2$.\nSince $0 < v \\leq 1$ and $0 < u_2 \\leq 1$, we have $v u_2 \\leq 1$. Thus, $\\min(1, v u_2) = v u_2$.\n$F_V(v) = \\int_0^1 v u_2 \\,du_2 = v \\left[ \\frac{u_2^2}{2} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{v}{2}$.\n\nCase 2: $v > 1$.\nIn this case, the line $u_1 = v u_2$ may exceed the boundary $u_1=1$. It's easier to calculate the complement probability, $P(V > v) = P(U_1 > v U_2) = P(U_2 < U_1/v)$.\n$P(V > v) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 I(u_2 < u_1/v) \\,du_2 \\,du_1 = \\int_0^1 \\left( \\int_0^{\\min(1, u_1/v)} 1 \\,du_2 \\right) \\,du_1$.\nSince $v > 1$ and $0 < u_1 \\leq 1$, we have $u_1/v < 1$. Thus, $\\min(1, u_1/v) = u_1/v$.\n$P(V > v) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u_1}{v} \\,du_1 = \\frac{1}{v} \\left[ \\frac{u_1^2}{2} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2v}$.\nTherefore, $F_V(v) = 1 - P(V > v) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2v}$.\n\nCombining the cases, the CDF of $V$ is:\n$F_V(v) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{v}{2} & 0 < v \\leq 1 \\\\ 1 - \\frac{1}{2v} & v > 1 \\end{cases}$\n\nThe PDF of $V$ is obtained by differentiating its CDF:\n$f_V(v) = \\frac{d}{dv} F_V(v) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{2} & 0 < v \\leq 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2v^2} & v > 1 \\end{cases}$\n\nNow we find the PDF of $Y = b \\ln(V)$.

In this range, $f_V(v) = 1/2$.\n$f_Y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left| \\frac{1}{b}\\exp(y/b) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\left(\\frac{y}{b}\\right)$ for $y \\leq 0$.\n\nCase b: $y > 0$. This corresponds to $v = \\exp(y/b) > 1$. In this range, $f_V(v) = 1/(2v^2)$.\n$f_Y(y) = \\frac{1}{2(v(y))^2} \\cdot \\left| \\frac{1}{b}\\exp(y/b) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2(\\exp(y/b))^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{b}\\exp(y/b) = \\frac{1}{2b} \\frac{\\exp(y/b)}{\\exp(2y/b)} = \\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{b}\\right)$ for $y > 0$.\n\nWe can combine these two cases into a single expression using the absolute value function. For $y \\leq 0$, $|y| = -y$, so $\\exp(y/b) = \\exp(-|y|/b)$. For $y > 0$, $|y| = y$, so $\\exp(-y/b) = \\exp(-|y|/b)$.\nThus, the PDF of $Y$ is:\n$$f_Y(y) = \\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y|}{b}\\right)$$\nThis is the PDF of a Laplace distribution with location parameter 0 and scale parameter $b$.\n\nFinally, we find the PDF of $X = \\mu + Y$. This is a simple location shift.\n$$f_X(x) = f_Y(x - \\mu) = \\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x - \\mu|}{b}\\right)$$\nThis is the general PDF for a Laplace distribution with location parameter $\\mu$ and scale parameter $b$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x-\\mu|}{b}\\right)}$$", "id": "1400045"}]}
