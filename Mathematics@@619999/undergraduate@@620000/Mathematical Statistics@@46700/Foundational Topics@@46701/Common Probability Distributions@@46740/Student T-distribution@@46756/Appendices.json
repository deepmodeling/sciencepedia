They conduct a small double-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess its efficacy. A group of $n_1 = 15$ patients receives Cardiorex for eight weeks, while a control group of $n_2 = 15$ patients receives a placebo. The change in systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) is recorded for each patient, where a negative value signifies a reduction.\n\nThe results are summarized as follows:\n-   **Treatment Group (Cardiorex):** Sample mean change $\\bar{x}_1 = -5.5$ mmHg, sample standard deviation $s_1 = 4.0$ mmHg.\n-   **Control Group (Placebo):** Sample mean change $\\bar{x}_2 = -3.0$ mmHg, sample standard deviation $s_2 = 3.5$ mmHg.\n\nA researcher conducts a two-sample t-test to compare the mean changes between the two groups, setting the null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2$ (the drug has no effect beyond placebo) against the alternative hypothesis $H_a: \\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$. Using a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, the researcher finds that the p-value for the test is approximately $0.12$.

The absence of statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis is not equivalent to evidence for the null hypothesis. The study may have had insufficient statistical power to detect a real, but modest, treatment effect.\n\nB. The conclusion is flawed because the p-value of $0.12$ means there is a 12% probability that the null hypothesis is true, which is too high to be certain but does not rule out an effect entirely.\n\nC. The researcher's conclusion is premature because it fails to account for the possibility of a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis).\n\nD.

The sample means are different ($\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2$), which directly contradicts the conclusion that there is no effect.

The null and alternative hypotheses are\n$$\nH_{0}:\\ \\mu_{1}=\\mu_{2},\\qquad H_{a}:\\ \\mu_{1}\\neq\\mu_{2}.\n$$\nLet $\\bar{x}_{1}$ and $\\bar{x}_{2}$ denote the sample means, $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ the sample standard deviations, and $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ the sample sizes for the treatment and control groups, respectively.

The reported result is $p\\approx 0.12$ with significance level $\\alpha=0.05$, so the decision rule “reject $H_{0}$ if $p\\leq \\alpha$” implies failure to reject $H_{0}$.\n\nCrucially, the logical interpretation of “fail to reject $H_{0}$” is not “accept $H_{0}$ as true” but “the data do not provide sufficient evidence against $H_{0}$ at the chosen $\\alpha$.” This does not constitute evidence for $H_{0}$. The distinction is essential because the test has a nonzero probability of a Type II error (failing to reject a false $H_{0}$). The probability of correctly detecting a true effect (power) depends on the true effect size, variability, significance level, and sample sizes. With $n_{1}=n_{2}=15$ and observed mean difference $\\bar{x}_{1}-\\bar{x}_{2}=-2.5$ mmHg, the study may have had limited power to detect a modest but real effect.

Even if alternative methods were considered, the central flaw is interpretational, not methodological.\n- Option E claims differing sample means contradict “no effect” and implies miscalculation; this ignores sampling variability and the inferential role of the test.\n\nThus, the most significant logical flaw is described by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1389845"}]}
