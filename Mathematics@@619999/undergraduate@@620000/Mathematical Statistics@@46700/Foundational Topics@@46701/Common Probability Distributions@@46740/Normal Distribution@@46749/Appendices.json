The diameter of each piston is a critical dimension for performance and must be carefully controlled. The manufacturing process results in piston diameters that are normally distributed.

We are given that $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, which can be written as $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nThe problem provides two pieces of information related to the percentiles of this distribution:\n1.  25% of the pistons have a diameter less than 74.50 mm. This corresponds to the 25th percentile, which can be expressed as a probability: $P(X \\le 74.50) = 0.25$.\n2.  75% of the pistons have a diameter less than 75.50 mm. This corresponds to the 75th percentile: $P(X \\le 75.50) = 0.75$.\n\nTo find $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, we first standardize the random variable $X$ by transforming it into the standard normal random variable $Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nThe problem provides the z-score for the 75th percentile of a standard normal distribution: if $P(Z \\le z_{0.75}) = 0.75$, then $z_{0.75} \\approx 0.6745$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the standard normal distribution about its mean of 0, the z-score for the 25th percentile, $z_{0.25}$, is the negative of the z-score for the 75th percentile. Specifically, $P(Z \\le -z) = 1 - P(Z \\le z)$. Therefore, $P(Z \\le -z_{0.75}) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$. This means the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.25 is $z_{0.25} = -z_{0.75} = -0.6745$.\n\nNow we can set up a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$:\n\nFor the 25th percentile (also known as the first quartile, $Q_1$):\n$z_{0.25} = \\frac{74.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n$-0.6745 = \\frac{74.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$  (Equation 1)\n\nFor the 75th percentile (also known as the third quartile, $Q_3$):\n$z_{0.75} = \\frac{75.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n$0.6745 = \\frac{75.50 - \\mu}{\\sigma}$  (Equation 2)\n\nWe can solve this system. Let's first solve for the mean $\\mu$. A simple method is to add the two equations after rewriting them:\nFrom Equation 1: $74.50 - \\mu = -0.6745 \\sigma$\nFrom Equation 2: $75.50 - \\mu = 0.6745 \\sigma$\n\nAdding these two equations together:\n$(74.50 - \\mu) + (75.50 - \\mu) = -0.6745 \\sigma + 0.6745 \\sigma$\n$150.00 - 2\\mu = 0$\n$2\\mu = 150.00$\n$\\mu = 75.00$\n\nThe mean diameter is 75.00 mm.\n\nNext, we solve for the standard deviation $\\sigma$. We can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n$(75.50 - \\mu) - (74.50 - \\mu) = 0.6745 \\sigma - (-0.6745 \\sigma)$\n$75.50 - 74.50 = 2 \\times 0.6745 \\sigma$\n$1.00 = 1.349 \\sigma$\n$\\sigma = \\frac{1.00}{1.349} \\approx 0.7412898...$\n\nThe standard deviation is approximately 0.7412898... mm.\n\nThe problem requires rounding both the mean and the standard deviation to three significant figures.\nMean: $\\mu = 75.00$, which rounded to three significant figures is $75.0$.\nStandard Deviation: $\\sigma \\approx 0.7412898...$, which rounded to three significant figures is $0.741$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix with the mean and standard deviation: $(\\mu, \\sigma)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 75.0 & 0.741 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "1403747"}, {"introduction": "When analyzing systems with multiple independent components, it's often crucial to understand the behavior of the most extreme values.
