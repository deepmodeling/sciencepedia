This scenario [@problem_id:1913300] challenges you to determine the maximum feasible sample size under a specific budget constraint, highlighting the crucial difference between the statistically optimal plan and the practically achievable one.", "problem": "A biomedical research group is planning a study to estimate the proportion, $p$, of a certain population that carries a specific genetic marker. For their results to be sufficiently precise, they initially aim to construct a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for $p$ with a margin of error no greater than $E=0.04$.\n\nThe cost of recruiting and testing participants is not uniform. The first 100 participants can be acquired at a cost of $10 per person. However, due to increased logistical complexity for a larger-scale search, any additional participants beyond the first 100 will cost $15 per person. The total budget allocated for participant acquisition is $2000.\n\nAfter an initial analysis, the researchers realize that their budget may not be sufficient to achieve their desired margin of error. They decide to proceed by using the largest possible sample size that their budget will allow. No prior estimate for the proportion $p$ is available. What is the maximum number of participants they can include in their study?", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum sample size that can be afforded given a total budget and a variable cost structure. It also provides information about a desired statistical precision (95% CI, margin of error $E=0.04$), which we should first analyze to understand the context of the researchers' decision.\n\nFirst, let's determine the sample size required to meet the desired precision. The formula for the sample size $n$ needed to estimate a population proportion $p$ with a specific margin of error $E$ and confidence level is:\n$$n = \\left(\\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}}{E}\\right)^2 p(1-p)$$\nFor a 95% confidence level, the significance level is $\\alpha = 0.05$, which means $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The corresponding critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.025} = 1.96$.\nThe desired margin of error is given as $E=0.04$.\nSince no prior estimate for the proportion $p$ is available, we use the most conservative value, $p=0.5$, which maximizes the product $p(1-p)$ and thus maximizes the required sample size.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we find the ideal sample size, $n_{ideal}$:\n$$n_{ideal} = \\left(\\frac{1.96}{0.04}\\right)^2 (0.5)(1 - 0.5) = (49)^2 (0.25) = 2401 \\times 0.25 = 600.25$$\nSince the sample size must be an integer, we must round up to ensure the margin of error is not exceeded. So, the required sample size to meet the precision goal is $n_{ideal} = 601$.\n\nNext, we must analyze the budget constraint. The total budget is $B = \\$2000$. The cost structure is piecewise:\n- The first 100 participants cost $c_1 = \\$10$ each.\n- Any additional participants cost $c_2 = \\$15$ each.\n\nLet's find the maximum sample size, $n_{max}$, that the budget can support.\nThe cost for the first 100 participants is:\n$$C_{100} = 100 \\times c_1 = 100 \\times \\$10 = \\$1000$$\nThis is within the total budget of $2000. So, the firm can afford to sample at least 100 people.\n\nAfter paying for the first 100 participants, the remaining budget is:\n$$B_{rem} = B - C_{100} = \\$2000 - \\$1000 = \\$1000$$\nThis remaining budget can be used to recruit additional participants at a cost of $c_2 = \\$15$ per person. The number of additional participants, $n_{add}$, they can afford is the integer part of the ratio of the remaining budget to the cost per additional participant:\n$$n_{add} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{B_{rem}}{c_2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\$1000}{\\$15} \\right\\rfloor$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\\frac{1000}{15} = \\frac{200}{3} = 66.66...$$\nSince a whole number of participants must be recruited, we take the floor of this value:\n$$n_{add} = 66$$\nThe total maximum sample size, $n_{max}$, is the sum of the participants from the first tier and the additional participants from the second tier:\n$$n_{max} = 100 + n_{add} = 100 + 66 = 166$$\n\nThe problem states that the researchers will proceed with the largest possible sample size their budget allows. We have found that the ideal sample size to meet the precision goal is $n_{ideal} = 601$, but the maximum affordable sample size is $n_{max} = 166$. Since $n_{max} < n_{ideal}$, they cannot achieve their initial goal. Therefore, according to their decision, the number of participants they will include is the maximum affordable number.\n\nThe maximum number of participants they can include in their study is 166.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{166}$$", "id": "1913300"}]}
