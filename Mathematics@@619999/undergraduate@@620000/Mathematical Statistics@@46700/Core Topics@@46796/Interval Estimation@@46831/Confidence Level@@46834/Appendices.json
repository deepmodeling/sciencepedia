A critical quality control metric is the proportion of manufactured pixels that are \"dead-on-arrival\" (DOA), meaning they do not light up. After producing a large pilot batch, a random sample of pixels is tested. The company's statistics team analyzes the sample data and constructs a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of DOA pixels in the entire batch. The resulting interval is reported as $[0.0415, 0.0585]$.\n\nFor a management briefing, two summary statistics are required: the single best point estimate for the proportion of DOA pixels, and the margin of error for this estimate. Determine these two values based on the provided confidence interval.", "solution": "Let the given confidence interval for the true proportion $p$ be denoted by $[L, U]$, where $L$ is the lower bound and $U$ is the upper bound. In this problem, $L = 0.0415$ and $U = 0.0585$.\n\nA confidence interval is constructed around a point estimate. For a proportion, the point estimate is the sample proportion, denoted by $\\hat{p}$. The interval takes the general form $(\\hat{p} - E, \\hat{p} + E)$, where $E$ is the margin of error.\n\nFrom this general form, we can establish a system of two linear equations:\n1. The lower bound of the interval is $L = \\hat{p} - E$.\n2. The upper bound of the interval is $U = \\hat{p} + E$.\n\nTo find the point estimate $\\hat{p}$, we can add the two equations together:\n$L + U = (\\hat{p} - E) + (\\hat{p} + E)$\n$L + U = 2\\hat{p}$\n$\\hat{p} = \\frac{L + U}{2}$\n\nThis shows that the point estimate $\\hat{p}$ is the midpoint of the confidence interval. Substituting the given values:\n$\\hat{p} = \\frac{0.0415 + 0.0585}{2} = \\frac{0.1000}{2} = 0.0500$\n\nTo find the margin of error $E$, we can subtract the first equation from the second:\n$U - L = (\\hat{p} + E) - (\\hat{p} - E)$\n$U - L = 2E$\n$E = \\frac{U - L}{2}$\n\nThis shows that the margin of error is half the width of the confidence interval. Substituting the given values:\n$E = \\frac{0.0585 - 0.0415}{2} = \\frac{0.0170}{2} = 0.0085$\n\nThus, the point estimate for the proportion of DOA pixels is $0.0500$, and the margin of error is $0.0085$.

The Wald interval relies on a normal approximation to the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ with estimated variance $\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n$. A standard condition for the adequacy of this approximation is that both $n\\hat{p}$ and $n(1-\\hat{p})$ be sufficiently large. Here, $n\\hat{p}=0$, which violates this condition. The degenerate interval $[0,0]$ misleadingly suggests absolute certainty about $p$, which cannot be justified from a finite sample with zero observed events. More appropriate methods (such as Wilson, Agresti–Coull, or exact Clopper–Pearson intervals) yield a nonzero upper bound for $p$ when zero events are observed.\n\nTherefore, the calculation using the Wald formula mechanically yields $[0,0]$, but this is misleading and indicates the normal approximation is inappropriate at the boundary $\\hat{p}\\in\\{0,1\\}$. This corresponds to option C. Options asserting undefined arithmetic or symmetry about zero with positive half-width are incorrect, and asserting that the result is valid is also incorrect. The claim that only $p<1/n$ can be concluded is also not warranted by the Wald computation and is not the standard inference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1908758"}]}
