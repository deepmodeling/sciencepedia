They perform a two-sided hypothesis test by collecting a random sample of $n=36$ batteries. The null hypothesis is that the mean lifespan is 10.0 years ($H_0: \\mu = 10.0$), and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean lifespan is not 10.0 years ($H_a: \\mu \\neq 10.0$).

Give your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$) when it is actually false. The probability of a Type II error is denoted by $\\beta$. In this problem, we are given that the null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu = 10.0$ is false, and the true mean is $\\mu_a = 11.0$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the \"failure to reject\" region (also known as the acceptance region) for the sample mean, $\\bar{X}$, under the null hypothesis. The test is a two-sided Z-test because the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is known and the population is normal.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Null hypothesis mean: $\\mu_0 = 10.0$\n- True alternative mean: $\\mu_a = 11.0$\n- Population standard deviation: $\\sigma = 2.0$\n- Sample size: $n = 36$\n- Significance level: $\\alpha = 0.05$\n\nThe standard error of the mean (SE) is calculated as:\n$$ SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{2.0}{\\sqrt{36}} = \\frac{2.0}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nUnder the null hypothesis, the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is normal with mean $\\mu_0=10.0$ and standard deviation $SE = 1/3$. That is, $\\bar{X} \\sim N(10.0, (1/3)^2)$.\n\nFor a two-sided test with $\\alpha = 0.05$, we have $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$ in each tail of the distribution. The critical z-values from the standard normal distribution that correspond to these tail probabilities are $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96$ and $-z_{\\alpha/2} = -z_{0.025} = -1.96$.\n\nWe fail to reject $H_0$ if the test statistic $Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{SE}$ falls between these critical values:\n$$ -1.96 \\le \\frac{\\bar{X} - 10.0}{1/3} \\le 1.96 $$\nWe can solve for $\\bar{X}$ to find the boundaries of the acceptance region:\n$$ -1.96 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\le \\bar{X} - 10.0 \\le 1.96 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ 10.0 - 1.96 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\le \\bar{X} \\le 10.0 + 1.96 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\nThe lower boundary is $\\bar{x}_{c, \\text{lower}} = 10.0 - \\frac{1.96}{3}$ and the upper boundary is $\\bar{x}_{c, \\text{upper}} = 10.0 + \\frac{1.96}{3}$.\nSo, the acceptance region for $\\bar{X}$ is approximately $[9.3467, 10.6533]$. We fail to reject $H_0$ if the observed sample mean falls within this interval.\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of a Type II error, $\\beta$. This is the probability that the observed sample mean $\\bar{X}$ falls into the acceptance region, given that the true mean is $\\mu_a = 11.0$. Under this alternative hypothesis, the sampling distribution of $\\bar{X}$ is $N(\\mu_a, (SE)^2)$, which is $N(11.0, (1/3)^2)$.\n\n$$ \\beta = P(\\bar{x}_{c, \\text{lower}} \\le \\bar{X} \\le \\bar{x}_{c, \\text{upper}} | \\mu = \\mu_a) $$\n$$ \\beta = P\\left(10.0 - \\frac{1.96}{3} \\le \\bar{X} \\le 10.0 + \\frac{1.96}{3} \\right) $$\nTo find this probability, we standardize the boundaries of the acceptance region with respect to the true mean $\\mu_a = 11.0$ and standard error $SE = 1/3$. Let $Z'$ be a standard normal random variable.\n\nThe lower Z-score is:\n$$ Z'_{\\text{lower}} = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{c, \\text{lower}} - \\mu_a}{SE} = \\frac{\\left(10.0 - \\frac{1.96}{3}\\right) - 11.0}{1/3} = \\frac{-1.0 - \\frac{1.96}{3}}{1/3} = -3.0 - 1.96 = -4.96 $$\nThe upper Z-score is:\n$$ Z'_{\\text{upper}} = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{c, \\text{upper}} - \\mu_a}{SE} = \\frac{\\left(10.0 + \\frac{1.96}{3}\\right) - 11.0}{1/3} = \\frac{-1.0 + \\frac{1.96}{3}}{1/3} = -3.0 + 1.96 = -1.04 $$\nSo, the probability of a Type II error is the probability that a standard normal variable $Z'$ falls between $-4.96$ and $-1.04$:\n$$ \\beta = P(-4.96 \\le Z' \\le -1.04) = \\Phi(-1.04) - \\Phi(-4.96) $$\nwhere $\\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Using a standard normal table or calculator:\n$$ \\Phi(-1.04) \\approx 0.14917 $$\n$$ \\Phi(-4.96) \\approx 0.00000035 $$\nThus,\n$$ \\beta \\approx 0.14917 - 0.00000035 = 0.14916965 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.1492$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1492}$$", "id": "1965595"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond a purely analytical role, this exercise places you in the position of an experimental designer.
