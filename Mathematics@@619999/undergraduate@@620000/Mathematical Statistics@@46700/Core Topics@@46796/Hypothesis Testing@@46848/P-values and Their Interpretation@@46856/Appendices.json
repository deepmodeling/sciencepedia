The standard alloy has a well-established mean tensile strength. The researchers formulate a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis states that the new alloy has the same mean tensile strength as the standard one, and the alternative hypothesis states that the new alloy has a greater mean tensile strength. This constitutes a one-tailed (upper-tail) test.\n\nAfter producing a sample of the new alloy and performing tensile tests, the researchers compute a test statistic. Assuming the test statistic follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis, its calculated value is $z = 1.75$.\n\nTo make the problem self-contained, you are given that for a standard normal random variable $Z$, the value of the cumulative distribution function at $z = 1.75$ is $P(Z \\le 1.75) = 0.9599$.\n\nCalculate the p-value for this hypothesis test.
