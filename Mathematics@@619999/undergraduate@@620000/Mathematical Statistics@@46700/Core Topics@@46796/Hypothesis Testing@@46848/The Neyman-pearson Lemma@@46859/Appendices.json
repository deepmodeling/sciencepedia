The key process in its fabrication either succeeds or fails. Two competing physical theories predict the probability of success, denoted by $p$. Theory A posits that the underlying quantum mechanics of the material's crystal structure results in a success probability of $p_A = 0.5$. Theory B, which incorporates a novel screening effect, predicts a success probability of $p_B = 0.25$.\n\nTo test these theories, a single, expensive prototype cell is fabricated. The outcome of the key process is recorded as a random variable $X$, where $X=1$ for success and $X=0$ for failure. This single trial can be modeled as a Bernoulli experiment with parameter $p$.\n\nA statistical test is set up to decide between the two theories, with the null hypothesis $H_0: p = 0.5$ (corresponding to Theory A) and the alternative hypothesis $H_1: p = 0.25$ (corresponding to Theory B).
