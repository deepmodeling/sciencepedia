Over a series of observations, the analyst records the number of requests per second ($x$) and the corresponding CPU load ($y$) as a percentage. To model this relationship, the analyst proposes a simple linear regression model of the form $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$.\n\nAfter collecting the data, the analyst computes the following summary statistics, which are essential for determining the least squares regression line:\n- The sum of squared deviations for the number of requests: $S_{xx} = \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = 4.81 \\times 10^4$ (requests/s)$^2$\n- The sum of the products of deviations for requests and CPU load: $S_{xy} = \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = 2.15 \\times 10^3$ percent $\\cdot$ (requests/s)\n\nUsing these summary statistics, calculate the estimated slope ($\\hat{\\beta}_1$) of the regression line.

The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, is the standard metric for this, measuring the proportion of data variability that your model successfully explains. This exercise demonstrates how to compute $R^2$ from its core components, providing a direct way to quantify your model's goodness-of-fit [@problem_id:1955438].", "problem": "An environmental scientist is studying the relationship between the concentration of a specific pollutant in a lake and the population density of a certain species of algae. To quantify this relationship, the scientist collects data from various locations in the lake and fits a simple linear regression model, where pollutant concentration is the explanatory variable and algae density is the response variable.\n\nIn the process of evaluating the model's fit, the scientist calculates two key metrics. The Total Sum of Squares (SST), which represents the total variation in the observed algae population densities, is calculated to be 150.0 (in units of thousands of cells per milliliter, squared). The Sum of Squares due to Regression (SSR), which measures the variation in algae density that is explained by the linear relationship with the pollutant concentration, is found to be 120.0 in the same units.\n\nCalculate the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, for this regression model.

It is hypothesized that the peak discharge is directly proportional to the total rainfall, which can be modeled by the equation $D = \\beta_1 R + \\epsilon$.
