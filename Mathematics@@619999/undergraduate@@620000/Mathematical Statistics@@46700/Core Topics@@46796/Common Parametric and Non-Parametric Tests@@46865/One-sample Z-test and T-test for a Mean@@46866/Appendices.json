The sample is analyzed, and the average amount of the active ingredient is found to be $\\bar{x} = 497$ mg.\n\nThe department's protocol for declaring a production line \"miscalibrated\" requires strong evidence. This standard is met if the probability of observing a sample mean at least as far from the target mean of 500 mg as the one measured (497 mg) is less than 0.05, assuming the production line is actually calibrated correctly (i.e., the true mean is 500 mg).\n\nBased on these criteria and the sample data, which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate?\n\nA.
