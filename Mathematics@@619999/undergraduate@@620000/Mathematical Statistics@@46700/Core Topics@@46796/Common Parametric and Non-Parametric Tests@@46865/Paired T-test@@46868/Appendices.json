Ten student volunteers participate in an experiment. Each student takes two standardized memory tests of equivalent difficulty, each scored out of 100. For one test, the student studies for a 15-minute period in a completely silent room. For the other test, the student studies for 15 minutes while listening to a specific classical music piece. The order of the two conditions (silent vs. music) is randomized for each student to prevent bias. The scores for each student under both conditions are recorded as follows:\n\n| Student | Score (Silent) | Score (Music) |\n|:-------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|\n| 1       | 75             | 78            |\n| 2       | 82             | 85            |\n| 3       | 68             | 67            |\n| 4       | 77             | 81            |\n| 5       | 90             | 94            |\n| 6       | 85             | 88            |\n| 7       | 73             | 73            |\n| 8       | 65             | 69            |\n| 9       | 88             | 92            |\n| 10      | 79             | 81            |\n\nTo determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two conditions, the scientist decides to perform a paired t-test.

Ten healthy adult volunteers participate in the study. Each participant's reaction time, in milliseconds (ms), to a visual stimulus is measured before taking the supplement. One hour after consuming a standard dose of the supplement, their reaction time to the same type of stimulus is measured again. The paired measurements (Before, After) for the ten participants are recorded as follows: (510, 495), (530, 520), (480, 485), (505, 490), (650, 530), (515, 500), (495, 490), (525, 510), (720, 540), and (500, 495).\n\nThe researcher wants to determine if the supplement has a statistically significant effect on reaction time. When deciding between a paired t-test and a sign test for analyzing these data, a preference for the sign test is argued. Which of the following statements provides the best statistical justification for this preference?\n\nA. The paired t-test assumes the differences between paired observations are approximately normally distributed. The presence of a few very large differences in this dataset makes this assumption questionable, whereas the sign test does not require normality.\n\nB. The sign test is always more statistically powerful than the paired t-test, regardless of the data's distribution, making it the superior choice for detecting an effect.\n\nC. The sample size of ten is too small to use a paired t-test, which requires a minimum of 30 observations to be valid according to the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nD. The sign test must be used because the data contains a negative difference (480 - 485 = -5), and the paired t-test is only valid when all differences are positive.\n\nE.

The presence of two very large magnitude differences, $-120$ and $-180$, relative to the rest, makes the normality assumption for the $d_{i}$ questionable and the $t$-test sensitive to outliers.\n\nThe sign test, by contrast, tests the median of the differences without assuming normality. Under $H_{0}$ that the median difference is zero, the signs of $d_{i}$ are modeled as i.i.d. Bernoulli with $P(d_{i}>0)=\\frac{1}{2}$, leading to a binomial count of positive signs. Because it uses only the signs and not the magnitudes, it is robust to outliers and does not require the normality of the $d_{i}$.\n\nTherefore, the statistically sound justification for preferring the sign test here is that the assumption of approximate normality for the paired differences is doubtful due to a few very large differences, whereas the sign test does not require normality. This corresponds to option A. The other options are incorrect: the sign test is not always more powerful than the paired $t$-test; a paired $t$-test does not require $n\\geq 30$; the presence of negative differences does not invalidate the $t$-test; and computational simplicity is not a statistical justification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1963411"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem elevates the paired t-test from a simple comparison tool to a concept deeply intertwined with experimental design and statistical power [@problem_id:1942781].

To achieve statistical significance, what is the minimum value of this correlation coefficient, $r_{min}$, that must be observed?\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for $r_{min}$ in terms of $k$, $\\bar{A}$, $\\bar{B}$, $s_A$, $s_B$, and $t_{crit}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum Pearson correlation coefficient, $r_{min}$, required to establish a statistically significant difference between the performance of Model A and Model B using a paired t-test.\n\nThe appropriate test for this paired data is the paired t-test. We define a new variable, $D_i = A_i - B_i$, representing the difference in accuracies for each fold $i$. The null hypothesis is that the true mean of these differences is zero, $H_0: \\mu_D = 0$, and the alternative is $H_1: \\mu_D \\neq 0$.\n\nThe sample mean of the differences is $\\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^k D_i = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^k (A_i - B_i) = \\bar{A} - \\bar{B}$.\nThe sample standard deviation of the differences is $s_D$. The paired t-test statistic is given by:\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{D} - 0}{s_D / \\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{\\bar{A} - \\bar{B}}{s_D / \\sqrt{k}}$$\nFor the result to be statistically significant at the level corresponding to the critical value $t_{crit}$, the absolute value of the t-statistic must satisfy $|t| \\ge t_{crit}$. Since the problem states that $\\bar{A} > \\bar{B}$, we have $\\bar{D} > 0$, so the t-statistic will be positive. The condition simplifies to $t \\ge t_{crit}$.\n\nThe main challenge is to express $s_D$ in terms of the given quantities, which include $s_A$, $s_B$, and the correlation coefficient $r$. The sample variance of the differences, $s_D^2$, is defined as:\n$$s_D^2 = \\frac{1}{k-1} \\sum_{i=1}^k (D_i - \\bar{D})^2$$\nSubstitute $D_i = A_i - B_i$ and $\\bar{D} = \\bar{A} - \\bar{B}$:\n$$D_i - \\bar{D} = (A_i - B_i) - (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B}) = (A_i - \\bar{A}) - (B_i - \\bar{B})$$\nSo, the expression for $s_D^2$ becomes:\n$$s_D^2 = \\frac{1}{k-1} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\left[ (A_i - \\bar{A}) - (B_i - \\bar{B}) \\right]^2$$\nExpanding the square inside the summation:\n$$s_D^2 = \\frac{1}{k-1} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\left[ (A_i - \\bar{A})^2 - 2(A_i - \\bar{A})(B_i - \\bar{B}) + (B_i - \\bar{B})^2 \\right]$$\nWe can distribute the summation and the factor $\\frac{1}{k-1}$:\n$$s_D^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k (A_i - \\bar{A})^2}{k-1} + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k (B_i - \\bar{B})^2}{k-1} - 2 \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k (A_i - \\bar{A})(B_i - \\bar{B})}{k-1}$$\nWe recognize the terms as the sample variances and the sample covariance:\n- Sample variance of A: $s_A^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k (A_i - \\bar{A})^2}{k-1}$\n- Sample variance of B: $s_B^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k (B_i - \\bar{B})^2}{k-1}$\n- Sample covariance of A and B: $s_{AB} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k (A_i - \\bar{A})(B_i - \\bar{B})}{k-1}$\n\nThus, the variance of the differences can be written as:\n$$s_D^2 = s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 s_{AB}$$\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ is defined as $r = \\frac{s_{AB}}{s_A s_B}$. We can express the covariance as $s_{AB} = r s_A s_B$. Substituting this into the equation for $s_D^2$:\n$$s_D^2 = s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 r s_A s_B$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $s_D^2$ back into the t-statistic formula:\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{A} - \\bar{B}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 r s_A s_B}{k}}}$$\nThe condition for statistical significance is $t \\ge t_{crit}$. We are looking for the minimum value of $r$ that satisfies this. A smaller denominator leads to a larger $t$ value. The denominator is minimized when the term $s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 r s_A s_B$ is minimized. This occurs for the largest possible value of $r$. Conversely, to meet the threshold $t \\ge t_{crit}$, we need the denominator to be small enough. Let's solve the inequality for $r$:\n$$\\frac{\\bar{A} - \\bar{B}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 r s_A s_B}{k}}} \\ge t_{crit}$$\nSince both sides are positive, we can square them without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\\frac{(\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2}{\\frac{s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 r s_A s_B}{k}} \\ge t_{crit}^2$$\nNow, we rearrange the inequality to solve for $r$:\n$$k (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2 \\ge t_{crit}^2 (s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 r s_A s_B)$$\n$$\\frac{k (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2}{t_{crit}^2} \\ge s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 r s_A s_B$$\nIsolate the term containing $r$:\n$$2 r s_A s_B \\ge s_A^2 + s_B^2 - \\frac{k (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2}{t_{crit}^2}$$\nSince $s_A$ and $s_B$ are standard deviations, they are non-negative. Assuming they are non-zero (otherwise correlation is undefined or trivial), we can divide by $2 s_A s_B$:\n$$r \\ge \\frac{s_A^2 + s_B^2}{2 s_A s_B} - \\frac{k (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2}{2 s_A s_B t_{crit}^2}$$\nThis inequality gives the condition that $r$ must satisfy for the result to be significant. The minimum value of $r$ required, $r_{min}$, is therefore the right-hand side of the inequality.\n\n$$r_{min} = \\frac{s_A^2 + s_B^2}{2 s_A s_B} - \\frac{k (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2}{2 s_A s_B t_{crit}^2}$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$r_{min} = \\frac{1}{2 s_A s_B} \\left( s_A^2 + s_B^2 - \\frac{k (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2}{t_{crit}^2} \\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the minimum required correlation coefficient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{s_A^2 + s_B^2}{2 s_A s_B} - \\frac{k (\\bar{A} - \\bar{B})^2}{2 s_A s_B t_{crit}^2}}$$", "id": "1942781"}]}
