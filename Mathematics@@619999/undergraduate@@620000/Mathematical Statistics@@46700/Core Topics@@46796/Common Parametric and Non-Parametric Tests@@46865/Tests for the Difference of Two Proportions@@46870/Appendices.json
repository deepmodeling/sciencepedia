Let the online survey be group 1 and the face-to-face interview be group 2.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters and statistics given in the problem.\nFor the anonymous online survey (group 1):\nSample size, $n_1 = 1250$\nNumber of \"successes\" (admissions), $x_1 = 175$\n\nFor the face-to-face interview (group 2):\nSample size, $n_2 = 880$\nNumber of \"successes\" (admissions), $x_2 = 96$\n\nThe significance level is $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe hypotheses are:\nNull hypothesis: $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ (The true proportions are equal).\nAlternative hypothesis: $H_a: p_1 \\ne p_2$ (The true proportions are different).

The pooled sample proportion, $\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}}$, is calculated by combining the data from both samples:\n$$ \\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \\frac{175 + 96}{1250 + 880} = \\frac{271}{2130} $$\nNumerically, $\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}} \\approx 0.12723$.\n\nNext, we calculate the test statistic, $Z$. The formula for the two-proportion z-test statistic is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2)}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}})(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}} $$\nLet's compute the components of this formula.\nThe difference in sample proportions is:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 = 0.14 - \\frac{6}{55} = \\frac{7}{50} - \\frac{6}{55} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 11 - 6 \\cdot 10}{550} = \\frac{77 - 60}{550} = \\frac{17}{550} \\approx 0.030909 $$\nThe standard error (the denominator of the Z-statistic) is:\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}})(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})} $$\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{271}{2130} \\left(1 - \\frac{271}{2130}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{1250} + \\frac{1}{880}\\right)} $$\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{271}{2130} \\cdot \\frac{1859}{2130} \\left(\\frac{1}{1250} + \\frac{1}{880}\\right)} $$\n$$ SE \\approx \\sqrt{0.12723 \\cdot (0.87277) \\cdot (0.0008 + 0.00113636)} $$\n$$ SE \\approx \\sqrt{0.11104 \\cdot (0.00193636)} \\approx \\sqrt{0.000215018} \\approx 0.0146635 $$\nNow we can compute the Z-statistic:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{SE} \\approx \\frac{0.030909}{0.0146635} \\approx 2.1078 $$\nRounding to two decimal places, the test statistic is $Z \\approx 2.11$.\n\nFinally, we must make a decision. We compare our calculated test statistic to the critical value from the standard normal distribution for a two-tailed test with $\\alpha = 0.05$. The critical value is $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$.\nFrom a standard normal table or calculator, the critical value $z_{0.025}$ is approximately $1.96$.\nThe decision rule is to reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{\\alpha/2}$.\nIn our case, $|2.11| = 2.11$ and $1.96$.\nSince $2.11 > 1.96$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the p-value method. The p-value for a two-tailed test is $2 \\cdot P(Z > |Z_{calc}|)$.\n$$ \\text{p-value} = 2 \\cdot P(Z > 2.11) = 2 \\cdot (1 - P(Z \\le 2.11)) $$\nUsing a standard normal table, $P(Z \\le 2.11) \\approx 0.9826$.\n$$ \\text{p-value} \\approx 2 \\cdot (1 - 0.9826) = 2 \\cdot (0.0174) = 0.0348 $$\nSince the p-value ($0.0348$) is less than the significance level ($\\alpha = 0.05$), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion: we reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence at the 5% level to conclude that the true proportion of individuals who admit to tax evasion differs between anonymous online surveys and face-to-face interviews.\n\nMatching our findings with the given options:\nThe calculated test statistic is approximately 2.11, and we reject the null hypothesis.
