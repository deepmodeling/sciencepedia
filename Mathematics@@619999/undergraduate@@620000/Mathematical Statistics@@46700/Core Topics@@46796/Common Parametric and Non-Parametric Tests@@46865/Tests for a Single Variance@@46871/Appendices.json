A lack of uniformity, indicated by a high variance in tensile strength, is undesirable. After producing a batch of samples, the scientist performs a statistical analysis on the measured tensile strength, which is assumed to follow a normal distribution. From the sample data, a 99% confidence interval for the true population variance, $\\sigma^2$, of the tensile strength is calculated to be $(5.6, 12.3)$ in units of megapascals squared ($\\text{MPa}^2$).\n\nThe historical standard for a comparable, well-established alloy requires the variance to be $\\sigma_0^2 = 15.0 \\text{ MPa}^2$. The scientist wishes to test if the new alloy's variance is significantly different from this historical standard. The null hypothesis is formulated as $H_0: \\sigma^2 = 15.0$ MPa$^2$, and the alternative is $H_1: \\sigma^2 \\neq 15.0$ MPa$^2$.

You will analyze a scenario where the crucial assumption of normality is violated, a common challenge in practice. This problem challenges you to think beyond mechanical calculation and assess the appropriateness of the $\\chi^2$ test, highlighting why understanding a test's limitations is as important as knowing how to perform it [@problem_id:1958557].", "problem": "An engineer at a firm specializing in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) is tasked with quality control for a new production line of silicon resonators. The target specification for the variance of the resonant frequency is $\\sigma_0^2 = 2.5 \\text{ Hz}^2$. To check if the production line is meeting this specification, the engineer collects a random sample of $n=50$ resonators and measures their resonant frequencies. The calculated sample variance is $s^2 = 3.4 \\text{ Hz}^2$.\n\nBefore proceeding with a standard hypothesis test, the engineer consults historical data from a similar, well-established manufacturing process. This data reveals that the distribution of resonant frequencies has always been significantly right-skewed due to an inherent physical phenomenon in the etching process, and cannot be assumed to be normal.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements provides the most statistically sound assessment of the situation for testing the hypothesis $H_0: \\sigma^2 = 2.5 \\text{ Hz}^2$?\n\nA. The engineer can proceed with the standard $\\chi^2$ test for variance. Due to the large sample size ($n=50$), the Central Limit Theorem guarantees that the test statistic $\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\sigma_0^2}$ will have an approximate chi-square distribution.\n\nB. The standard $\\chi^2$ test for variance is inappropriate because its validity is highly dependent on the normality of the underlying population. The strong skewness violates this assumption, making the test's results unreliable. An alternative non-parametric method, such as a bootstrap hypothesis test, should be used.\n\nC. The skewness of the population distribution only impacts hypothesis tests concerning the population mean, not the population variance. Therefore, the standard $\\chi^2$ test for variance remains the appropriate and valid method to use.\n\nD. The standard $\\chi^2$ test for variance is not appropriate. Instead, the engineer should use a one-sample t-test to compare the sample variance $s^2=3.4$ to the hypothesized variance $\\sigma_0^2=2.5$.\n\nE. The engineer should first apply a logarithmic transformation to the frequency data to make its distribution more symmetric, and then apply the standard $\\chi^2$ test to the variance of the transformed data. The conclusion of this test will be directly applicable to the variance of the original, untransformed data.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most appropriate way to conduct a hypothesis test for a single population variance, $H_0: \\sigma^2 = \\sigma_0^2$, given that the sample is drawn from a non-normal, skewed population.\n\nThe standard procedure for testing a hypothesis about a single population variance is the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test. The test statistic is calculated as:\n$$ \\chi^2_{\\text{stat}} = \\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\sigma_0^2} $$\nwhere $n$ is the sample size, $s^2$ is the sample variance, and $\\sigma_0^2$ is the hypothesized population variance.\n\nA critical assumption for this test is that the test statistic, $\\chi^2_{\\text{stat}}$, follows a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. This assumption holds **if and only if** the sample is drawn from a normally distributed population.\n\nIn this problem, we are explicitly told that the underlying distribution of resonant frequencies is \"significantly right-skewed\" and \"cannot be assumed to be normal.\" This violates the core assumption of the $\\chi^2$ test for variance. Unlike the t-test for the mean, which is relatively robust to moderate departures from normality due to the Central Limit Theorem, the $\\chi^2$ test for variance is known to be highly sensitive to the normality assumption. If the population is not normal, the actual distribution of the test statistic can be very different from a $\\chi^2$ distribution, leading to an actual Type I error rate that is far from the nominal significance level $\\alpha$. Therefore, applying the standard $\\chi^2$ test would yield unreliable and likely incorrect conclusions.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this understanding:\n\n**A. Incorrect.** This statement incorrectly applies the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the *sample mean* ($\\bar{X}$) approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. It does not apply to the sampling distribution of the *sample variance* ($s^2$) or the test statistic $\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\sigma_0^2}$. The distribution of this statistic is tied to the normality of the parent population via Cochran's theorem, regardless of sample size.\n\n**B. Correct.** This statement accurately identifies the core issue: the $\\chi^2$ test is not robust to violations of the normality assumption, especially significant skewness. It correctly concludes that the test is inappropriate and suggests a valid alternative. Bootstrap methods are a class of non-parametric, computer-intensive resampling techniques that do not require assumptions about the underlying population distribution. A bootstrap hypothesis test for variance would involve repeatedly drawing samples with replacement from the original sample to build an empirical sampling distribution of the variance, and then using this distribution to calculate a p-value for the observed sample variance. This is a standard and appropriate approach in modern statistics when theoretical assumptions are violated.\n\n**C. Incorrect.** This statement is false. While tests for the mean (like the t-test) are often discussed in the context of robustness, tests for variance are also heavily dependent on the population distribution. In fact, the test for variance is *less* robust than the test for the mean. The kurtosis (\"tailedness\") and skewness of the population distribution directly affect the distribution of the sample variance.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** The one-sample t-test is used to test hypotheses about a single population *mean*, not a variance. This option confuses the purpose of different statistical tests. There is no standard \"t-test for variance.\"\n\n**E. Incorrect.** While transforming data (e.g., using a log transform for right-skewed data) is a common strategy to achieve approximate normality, it changes the nature of the hypothesis being tested. A $\\chi^2$ test on the variance of the log-transformed data, i.e., testing a hypothesis about $\\text{Var}(\\ln(X))$, is not equivalent to testing a hypothesis about the variance of the original data, $\\text{Var}(X)$. In general, $\\text{Var}(\\ln(X)) \\neq \\ln(\\text{Var}(X))$, and the relationship between the two is not simple. Thus, the conclusion from the test on transformed data is not directly applicable to the original research question.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and statistically sound statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1958557"}]}
