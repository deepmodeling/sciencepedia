Total: $4+12+4=20$.\n\nThe resulting unique values of $U$ and their frequencies are:\n$\\pm \\frac{53}{30}$ (1 each), $\\pm \\frac{33}{30}$ (1 each), $\\pm \\frac{23}{30}$ (3 each), $\\pm \\frac{17}{30}$ (1 each), $\\pm \\frac{13}{30}$ (2 each), $\\pm \\frac{7}{30}$ (2 each). Total = $2(1+1+3+1+2+2)=20$.\n\nOur observed statistic is $U_{\\text{obs}} = -13/30$. The two-sided p-value is the proportion of all possible assignments that result in a statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, i.e., $P(|U| \\geq |U_{\\text{obs}}|) = P(|U| \\geq 13/30)$.\n\nThe values of $|U|$ in the distribution are: $\\frac{7}{30}, \\frac{13}{30}, \\frac{17}{30}, \\frac{23}{30}, \\frac{33}{30}, \\frac{53}{30}$.\nThe number of outcomes where $|U|  13/30$ corresponds to the outcomes where $U = \\pm 7/30$. There are 2 outcomes for $U=7/30$ and 2 outcomes for $U=-7/30$. Thus, there are 4 outcomes less extreme than the observed one.\nThe number of outcomes as or more extreme than observed is $20 - 4 = 16$.\n\nThe exact two-sided p-value is therefore:\n$$\np=\\frac{16}{20}=0.8.\n$$\n\nRounded to four significant figures, the p-value is $0.8000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "1962134"}]}
