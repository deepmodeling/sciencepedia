For a function to validly represent the probability of surviving beyond time $t$, it must satisfy a specific set of properties. This first practice problem challenges you to act as a reviewer, testing a proposed function against these fundamental criteria, which is a crucial first step in any reliability analysis. [@problem_id:1963966]", "problem": "In reliability theory, the survival function $S(t)$ of a component gives the probability that the component's lifetime $T$ is greater than some time $t$, i.e., $S(t) = P(T > t)$. For a function to be a valid survival function for a non-negative lifetime random variable, it must be defined for all $t \\ge 0$ and satisfy three essential conditions:\n\n1.  $S(0) = 1$.\n2.  $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} S(t) = 0$.\n3.  $S(t)$ is a non-increasing function for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nA student proposes a model for the lifetime of a specific biological cell, suggesting its survival function could be described by the function $G(t) = 1 - \\sin(t)$, but only specified over the domain $t \\in [0, \\pi/2]$.\n\nAnalyze this proposed function $G(t)$ against the required properties. Which of the following statements correctly identifies why $G(t)$, as defined, fails to be a valid survival function?\n\nA. The function fails because $G(0) \\ne 1$.\n\nB. The function fails because it is not non-increasing over its specified domain.\n\nC. The function fails because properties 1 and 3 are both violated.\n\nD. The function fails because it is not defined on the entire domain $t \\ge 0$, which is necessary to verify all properties, particularly the limit as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nE. The proposed function $G(t)$ satisfies all necessary properties on its given domain and could be part of a valid survival function without any issues.", "solution": "To determine if the proposed function $G(t) = 1 - \\sin(t)$ on the domain $t \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ is a valid survival function, we must check it against the three required properties. A valid survival function must be defined for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Check Property 1: $S(0) = 1$.**\nThe proposed function is $G(t) = 1 - \\sin(t)$, and its domain $[0, \\pi/2]$ includes $t=0$. We evaluate the function at this point:\n$$G(0) = 1 - \\sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1$$\nProperty 1 is satisfied. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Step 2: Check Property 3: $S(t)$ is non-increasing for $t \\ge 0$.**\nA key part of this property is that it must apply for all $t \\ge 0$. The function $G(t)$ is only defined on $[0, \\pi/2]$. We can, however, check the non-increasing nature of the function *on its given domain*. To do this, we examine its derivative, $G'(t)$.\n$$G'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(1 - \\sin(t)) = -\\cos(t)$$\nFor the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, the function $\\cos(t)$ is always non-negative (i.e., $\\cos(t) \\ge 0$). Therefore, its negative, $G'(t) = -\\cos(t)$, must be non-positive (i.e., $G'(t) \\le 0$). This means that the function $G(t)$ is non-increasing over its entire specified domain of $[0, \\pi/2]$.\nSo, property 3 is not violated on the given domain. This eliminates option B.\n\n**Step 3: Check Property 2: $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} S(t) = 0$.**\nThis property requires that the function be defined for all values of $t$ up to infinity, so we can evaluate the limit. The proposed function $G(t)$ is explicitly defined only for $t \\in [0, \\pi/2]$. There is no information provided about the behavior of the function for $t > \\pi/2$. Because the domain of $G(t)$ is not $[0, \\infty)$, it is impossible to evaluate the limit as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fundamental failure of $G(t)$ as a valid survival function is its incomplete definition. A survival function must be defined over the entire non-negative real line, $[0, \\infty)$, to represent the probability of survival for all possible future times. The given function $G(t)$ is only a segment of a function. Because its domain is restricted, property 2 (the limit at infinity) cannot be verified. This directly corresponds to the reason stated in option D. Option E is incorrect because a function that cannot be checked against all required properties cannot be considered valid. The primary issue is the domain constraint, which makes it impossible to verify a key property.\n\nTherefore, the function fails because it is not defined on the entire domain $t \\ge 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1963966"}, {"introduction": "While the survival function provides a direct look at longevity, it is fundamentally linked to the probability density function (PDF), $f(t)$.
