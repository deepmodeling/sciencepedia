Define the components of the Bayesian model:**\n\n*   **Parameter Space:** The possible values for the number of faces $N$ are given by the set $\\mathcal{S} = \\{4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20\\}$.\n*   **Prior Distribution:** The prior belief is that each value of $N$ in $\\mathcal{S}$ is equally likely. Since there are 6 possible values, the prior probability for each is:\n    $$P(N=n) = \\pi(n) = \\frac{1}{6} \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathcal{S}$$\n*   **Data:** The experiment consists of $k=5$ rolls, and the observed data is that the maximum roll is $M=8$.\n*   **Likelihood Function:** The likelihood, $L(n | M=8)$, is the probability of observing the data ($M=8$) given a specific value of the parameter ($N=n$). Let $X_1, \\dots, X_5$ be the outcomes of the 5 rolls. The rolls are independent and uniformly distributed on $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n    The probability that a single roll $X_i$ is less than or equal to $m$ is $P(X_i \\leq m | N=n) = m/n$.\n    The probability that the maximum of 5 rolls is less than or equal to $m$ is the probability that all 5 rolls are less than or equal to $m$:\n    $$P(M \\leq m | N=n) = P(X_1 \\leq m, \\dots, X_5 \\leq m | N=n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{5} P(X_i \\leq m | N=n) = \\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right)^5$$\n    The probability that the maximum roll is exactly $m$ is given by:\n    $$P(M=m | N=n) = P(M \\leq m | N=n) - P(M \\leq m-1 | N=n)$$\n    Substituting $m=8$ and $k=5$, our likelihood function is:\n    $$L(n | M=8) = P(M=8 | N=n) = \\left(\\frac{8}{n}\\right)^5 - \\left(\\frac{7}{n}\\right)^5 = \\frac{8^5 - 7^5}{n^5}$$\n    This likelihood is only defined for $n \\geq 8$. If $n < 8$, it is impossible to roll an 8, so the likelihood is 0.\n\n**2. Calculate the Posterior Distribution:**\n\nThe posterior probability $P(N=n | M=8)$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior, according to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(N=n | M=8) \\propto P(M=8 | N=n) \\times P(N=n)$$\nSince the prior $P(N=n) = 1/6$ is constant for all $n \\in \\mathcal{S}$, the posterior is directly proportional to the likelihood:\n$$P(N=n | M=8) \\propto L(n | M=8)$$\n\nWe calculate the likelihood for each possible value of $N$:\n\n*   For $N=4$ and $N=6$: It is impossible to observe a maximum of 8, so $L(4 | M=8) = 0$ and $L(6 | M=8) = 0$. The posterior probabilities for these values are also 0.\n*   For $N \\in \\{8, 10, 12, 20\\}$, the likelihood is non-zero. Let's calculate the term $8^5 - 7^5 = 32768 - 16807 = 15961$.\n    The likelihoods are proportional to $1/n^5$:\n    *   $L(8 | M=8) = \\frac{15961}{8^5} = \\frac{15961}{32768} \\approx 0.48709$\n    *   $L(10 | M=8) = \\frac{15961}{10^5} = \\frac{15961}{100000} = 0.15961$\n    *   $L(12 | M=8) = \\frac{15961}{12^5} = \\frac{15961}{248832} \\approx 0.06414$\n    *   $L(20 | M=8) = \\frac{15961}{20^5} = \\frac{15961}{3200000} \\approx 0.00499$\n\n**3. Normalize the Posterior:**\n\nTo find the actual posterior probabilities, we must normalize so that they sum to 1. Let $K$ be the sum of the unnormalized posterior values (which are proportional to the likelihoods).\n$$K = L(8) + L(10) + L(12) + L(20) \\approx 0.48709 + 0.15961 + 0.06414 + 0.00499 \\approx 0.71583$$\nNow we compute the normalized posterior probabilities:\n*   $P(N=8 | M=8) = \\frac{L(8)}{K} \\approx \\frac{0.48709}{0.71583} \\approx 0.6804$\n*   $P(N=10 | M=8) = \\frac{L(10)}{K} \\approx \\frac{0.15961}{0.71583} \\approx 0.2230$\n*   $P(N=12 | M=8) = \\frac{L(12)}{K} \\approx \\frac{0.06414}{0.71583} \\approx 0.0896$\n*   $P(N=20 | M=8) = \\frac{L(20)}{K} \\approx \\frac{0.00499}{0.71583} \\approx 0.0070$\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is approximately $0.6804 + 0.2230 + 0.0896 + 0.0070 = 1.0000$.\n\n**4. Construct the Credible Set:**\n\nTo find the smallest 90% credible set, we rank the values of $N$ by their posterior probability (from highest to lowest) and add them to our set until the cumulative probability is at least 0.90.\n\nThe order of posterior probabilities is: $P(N=8) > P(N=10) > P(N=12) > P(N=20)$.\n\n1.  Start with the most probable value: The set is $\\{8\\}$. The cumulative probability is $\\approx 0.6804$. This is less than 0.90.\n2.  Add the next most probable value: The set is now $\\{8, 10\\}$. The cumulative probability is $\\approx 0.6804 + 0.2230 = 0.9034$.\n\nSince $0.9034 \\geq 0.90$, the set $\\{8, 10\\}$ is a 90% credible set. Because we added values in decreasing order of posterior probability, this is the smallest such set. Any other set of two values would have a lower total probability. For example, the set $\\{8, 12\\}$ has a probability of $0.6804 + 0.0896 = 0.7700$. Therefore, the smallest 90% credible set for $N$ is $\\{8, 10\\}$.
