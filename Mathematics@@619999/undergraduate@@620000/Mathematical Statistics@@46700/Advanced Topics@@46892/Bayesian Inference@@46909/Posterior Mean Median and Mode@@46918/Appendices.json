The posterior mode, representing the most probable value of a parameter, is a common and intuitive choice. This first exercise provides fundamental practice in finding the posterior mode by working from first principles, combining a given likelihood with a prior distribution to derive the posterior. [@problem_id:1945427]", "problem": "An engineering team is testing a new type of solid-state transistor for use in a satellite's communication system. The reliability of the transistor, defined as the probability $p$ of it functioning correctly under a specific stress test, is unknown. Based on theoretical models and the performance of similar materials, the team's prior belief about $p$ is described by a triangular probability density function defined over the interval $[0, 1]$:\n$$ \\pi(p) = 2p, \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le p \\le 1 $$\nThis prior reflects the belief that higher reliability is more probable.\n\nTo update their belief, the team conducts an experiment consisting of three independent stress tests on three identical transistors. The experiment results in two transistors functioning correctly and one failing.\n\nAssuming the outcomes of the tests are independent Bernoulli trials, calculate the posterior mode of the reliability probability $p$. The posterior mode is the value of the parameter that maximizes the posterior probability density function.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the posterior mode of the probability $p$. In Bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution is found by combining the prior distribution with the likelihood function using Bayes' theorem. The posterior is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$ \\pi(p | \\text{data}) \\propto L(\\text{data} | p) \\times \\pi(p) $$\nThe posterior mode is the value of $p$ that maximizes this posterior probability density function.\n\nFirst, let's identify the prior distribution. The problem states that the prior probability density function (PDF) for $p$ is:\n$$ \\pi(p) = 2p, \\quad \\text{for } p \\in [0, 1] $$\n\nNext, we determine the likelihood function. The data consists of the outcomes of three independent trials: two successes (correctly functioning) and one failure. This is a binomial experiment with $n=3$ trials and $k=2$ successes. The likelihood function for a binomial outcome is given by:\n$$ L(k, n | p) = \\binom{n}{k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nSubstituting our data, $n=3$ and $k=2$, we get:\n$$ L(\\text{data} | p) = \\binom{3}{2} p^{2} (1-p)^{3-2} = 3p^{2}(1-p) $$\n\nNow, we can find the posterior distribution by multiplying the likelihood and the prior. We only need the part of the posterior that depends on $p$, as any constant factors will not affect the location of the mode. This part is often called the kernel of the posterior distribution.\n$$ \\pi(p | \\text{data}) \\propto L(\\text{data} | p) \\times \\pi(p) $$\n$$ \\pi(p | \\text{data}) \\propto \\left( 3p^{2}(1-p) \\right) \\times (2p) $$\n$$ \\pi(p | \\text{data}) \\propto 6p^{3}(1-p) $$\nTo find the mode, we need to find the value of $p$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ that maximizes the function $f(p) = p^{3}(1-p)$. We can ignore the constant factor of 6. Let's expand this function:\n$$ f(p) = p^3 - p^4 $$\nTo find the maximum, we take the derivative of $f(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it to zero.\n$$ f'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}(p^3 - p^4) = 3p^2 - 4p^3 $$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find critical points:\n$$ 3p^2 - 4p^3 = 0 $$\n$$ p^2(3 - 4p) = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions for $p$ in the interval $[0, 1]$: $p=0$ and $3 - 4p = 0$, which gives $p = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nTo determine which of these critical points corresponds to a maximum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of $f(p)$ is:\n$$ f''(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}(3p^2 - 4p^3) = 6p - 12p^2 $$\nNow we evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\nAt $p=0$:\n$$ f''(0) = 6(0) - 12(0)^2 = 0 $$\nThe second derivative test is inconclusive for $p=0$. However, by examining the first derivative $f'(p) = p^2(3-4p)$, we see that for a small positive value of $p$ (e.g., $p=0.1$), $f'(p)$ is positive. This means the function is increasing from $p=0$, so $p=0$ must be a local minimum, corresponding to a posterior probability of zero.\n\nAt $p = \\frac{3}{4}$:\n$$ f''\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = 6\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) - 12\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{18}{4} - 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\frac{9}{2} - \\frac{27}{4} = \\frac{18}{4} - \\frac{27}{4} = -\\frac{9}{4} $$\nSince $f''(\\frac{3}{4}) < 0$, the function $f(p)$ has a local maximum at $p = \\frac{3}{4}$. As this is the only local maximum in the interval $(0, 1)$, it is the global maximum within the domain of $p$.\n\nTherefore, the posterior mode of the reliability probability $p$ is $\\frac{3}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$$", "id": "1945427"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the mode, the posterior mean and median offer different perspectives on the central tendency of our beliefs, especially when the posterior distribution is not symmetric.
