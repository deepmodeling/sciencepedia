The probability of a collision with a positive ion is $p = 5/8$, and the probability of a collision with a negative ion is $1-p = 3/8$.\n\nA collision with a positive ion adds a charge of $+e$ to the particle, while a collision with a negative ion adds a charge of $-e$. The particle is initially neutral, having zero charge. Let $Q_n$ be the total charge on the particle after $n$ collisions.\n\nIn the long-term limit as the number of collisions $n$ becomes very large, the average charge per collision, $Q_n/n$, will stabilize and converge to a specific constant value with probability one (i.e., almost surely).
