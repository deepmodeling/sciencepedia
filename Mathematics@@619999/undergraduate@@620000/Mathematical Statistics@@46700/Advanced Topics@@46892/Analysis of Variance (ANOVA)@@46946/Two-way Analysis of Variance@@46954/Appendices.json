A significant interaction effect is one of the most important, and often misinterpreted, findings in a two-way ANOVA. This problem [@problem_id:1964658] presents a common but flawed analytical path to highlight why examining main effects can be profoundly misleading when an interaction is present, sharpening your skills in the critical interpretation of experimental results.", "problem": "An agricultural scientist conducts an experiment to study the effect of three different types of fertilizer (F1, F2, F3) and two different soil types (S1, S2) on the yield of a crop, measured in kg/plot. The experiment uses a completely randomized design with 10 plots for each of the $3 \\times 2 = 6$ treatment combinations.\n\nAfter collecting the data, a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is performed. The results from the ANOVA table indicate that the F-test for the interaction effect between fertilizer type and soil type is statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) from the ANOVA table is 25.0, with 54 degrees of freedom.\n\nThe analyst observes the following cell means and marginal means for the fertilizer types:\n\n**Cell Means (kg/plot):**\n- Fertilizer F1, Soil S1: 50.0\n- Fertilizer F1, Soil S2: 70.0\n- Fertilizer F2, Soil S1: 65.0\n- Fertilizer F2, Soil S2: 65.0\n- Fertilizer F3, Soil S1: 80.0\n- Fertilizer F3, Soil S2: 50.0\n\n**Marginal Means for Fertilizer Type (kg/plot):**\n- Fertilizer F1: 60.0\n- Fertilizer F2: 65.0\n- Fertilizer F3: 65.0\n\nIgnoring the significant interaction, the analyst proceeds to perform pairwise comparisons of the marginal means for the three fertilizer types using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) procedure. Based on this test, the analyst concludes that the mean yields for F2 and F3 are statistically equivalent, and both are significantly higher than the mean yield for F1.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental criticism of the analyst's post-hoc comparison of the marginal means for the three fertilizer types?\n\nA. The analyst should have used the Bonferroni correction instead of Tukey's HSD, as it provides better control over the family-wise error rate in the presence of an interaction.\n\nB. The comparison is flawed because the significant interaction effect violates the assumption of homogeneity of variances required for Tukey's HSD.\n\nC. The comparison of marginal means is conceptually misleading because the presence of a significant interaction implies that the effect of the fertilizer type depends on the soil type, making the \"average\" effect of a fertilizer uninterpretable.\n\nD. The analyst cannot perform any post-hoc tests because the F-test for the interaction was significant, which invalidates any further pairwise comparisons.\n\nE. The calculation for Tukey's HSD should have used a critical value from the F-distribution instead of the studentized range distribution, as this is a two-factor experiment.", "solution": "We formalize the two-way ANOVA model for fertilizer type ($i=1,2,3$), soil type ($j=1,2$), and replicates ($k=1,\\dots,10$) as\n$$\nY_{ijk}=\\mu+\\alpha_{i}+\\beta_{j}+(\\alpha\\beta)_{ij}+\\varepsilon_{ijk},\n$$\nwith $\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\sim\\text{i.i.d. }N(0,\\sigma^{2})$. A statistically significant F-test for the interaction term implies that for at least some $(i,j)$ pairs, $(\\alpha\\beta)_{ij}\\neq 0$. This directly means the effect of fertilizer depends on soil, i.e., the difference between fertilizer levels is not constant across soil types.\n\nThe marginal mean for fertilizer $i$ averages over soils:\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{i\\cdot\\cdot}=\\mu+\\alpha_{i}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2}\\beta_{j}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2}(\\alpha\\beta)_{ij}.\n$$\nBecause $(\\alpha\\beta)_{ij}$ is nonzero and varies with $j$, the quantity $\\alpha_{i}$ is not separately interpretable from $(\\alpha\\beta)_{ij}$ when summarizing across $j$. Consequently, comparing $\\bar{Y}_{i\\cdot\\cdot}$ across $i$ does not estimate a single, consistent fertilizer effect; it conflates effects that differ by soil level.\n\nThe given cell means demonstrate this dependence explicitly by examining simple effects within each soil:\n- In soil $S1$: $F2-F1=65.0-50.0=15.0$, $F3-F2=80.0-65.0=15.0$, $F3-F1=80.0-50.0=30.0$.\n- In soil $S2$: $F2-F1=65.0-70.0=-5.0$, $F3-F2=50.0-65.0=-15.0$, $F3-F1=50.0-70.0=-20.0$.\nThese effects reverse direction across soils (a crossover interaction). Therefore, the marginal means for fertilizer ($60.0,65.0,65.0$) average across opposite effects and are not meaningful for describing a fertilizer’s effect without conditioning on soil. This makes post-hoc comparisons of the fertilizer marginal means conceptually misleading in the presence of a significant interaction; one should instead compare simple effects (e.g., fertilizers within each soil) or use contrasts tailored to the interaction.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: the fundamental problem is not the choice of family-wise error control (Tukey versus Bonferroni) but the interpretability of marginal means under interaction.\n- B is incorrect: a significant interaction concerns mean structure, not variance homogeneity; it does not imply violation of equal variances required for Tukey’s HSD.\n- C is correct: with a significant interaction, the effect of fertilizer depends on soil, so averaging across soils yields an uninterpretable “average” effect and misleads inference.\n- D is incorrect: post-hoc tests are still possible and appropriate, but they should target simple effects or interaction contrasts, not marginal main effects.\n- E is incorrect: Tukey’s HSD uses the studentized range distribution, not an F distribution, even in multi-factor designs when comparing means.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental criticism is that comparing marginal means is conceptually misleading when the interaction is significant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1964658"}]}
