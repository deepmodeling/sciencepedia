This exercise provides a clear, quantitative illustration of this principle by comparing the required significance level for a small-scale study versus a large-scale one.

The significance level for the test of the primary endpoint, denoted $\\alpha_p$, is required to be exactly twice the significance level for the test of any single secondary endpoint, denoted $\\alpha_s$. It is assumed that all four secondary endpoints are of equal importance, and thus their corresponding tests share the same significance level $\\alpha_s$.\n\nTo ensure the FWER is controlled at level $\\alpha$ while maximizing statistical power, the individual significance levels must sum to the total FWER.
