When we perform multiple hypothesis tests, our chance of making at least one false discovery—a 'false positive'—inflates surprisingly quickly.

The study measures the effects of the drug on $k=7$ different physiological markers in a test group versus a control group.

Assume a \"global null\" scenario, meaning that the drug is, in fact, completely ineffective and has no effect on any of the 7 markers. Therefore, all 7 null hypotheses are true.\n\nGiven that the 7 tests are statistically independent, calculate the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER).

The formula is:\n$$LSD = t_{\\alpha/2, df_E} \\sqrt{MSE \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i} + \\frac{1}{n_j} \\right)}$$\nSince the sample sizes are equal ($n_i = n_j = n = 10$), the formula simplifies to:\n$$LSD = t_{\\alpha/2, df_E} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot MSE}{n}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$LSD = 2.028 \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot 160}{10}} = 2.028 \\sqrt{\\frac{320}{10}} = 2.028 \\sqrt{32}$$\n$$LSD \\approx 2.028 \\times 5.65685 \\approx 11.470$$\nFor the LSD method, any pair of means with an absolute difference greater than $11.470$ is declared significantly different.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the critical difference for Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD).**\nTukey's HSD is designed to control the family-wise error rate for all pairwise comparisons. The formula for the critical difference is:\n$$HSD = q_{\\alpha, k, df_E} \\sqrt{\\frac{MSE}{n}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$HSD = 3.814 \\sqrt{\\frac{160}{10}} = 3.814 \\sqrt{16} = 3.814 \\times 4$$\n$$HSD = 15.256$$\nFor the HSD method, any pair of means with an absolute difference greater than $15.256$ is declared significantly different.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the difference between Group 2 and Group 3 means to the critical values.**\nThe means for the two groups in question are $\\bar{x}_2 = 88$ and $\\bar{x}_3 = 75$.\nThe absolute difference between their means is:\n$$|\\bar{x}_2 - \\bar{x}_3| = |88 - 75| = 13$$\n\n**Step 4: Draw conclusions for each method.**\n- **For LSD:** We compare the observed difference (13) with the LSD critical value (11.470). Since $13 > 11.470$, the difference between Group 2 and Group 3 is statistically significant according to the LSD method.\n- **For HSD:** We compare the observed difference (13) with the HSD critical value (15.256). Since $13  15.256$, the difference between Group 2 and Group 3 is **not** statistically significant according to the HSD method.\n\nThis highlights the key difference between the two methods: Tukey's HSD is more conservative (requires a larger difference for significance) than Fisher's LSD when the number of groups is greater than 3, because HSD controls the family-wise error rate while LSD does not (it controls the per-comparison error rate).\n\nBased on this analysis, the LSD method finds a significant difference, but the HSD method does not. This corresponds to option C. Option E is incorrect because the two methods yield different conclusions for at least this one pair.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1938498"}]}
