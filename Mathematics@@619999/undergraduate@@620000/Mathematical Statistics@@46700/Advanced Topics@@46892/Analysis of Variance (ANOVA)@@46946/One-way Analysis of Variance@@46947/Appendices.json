After a growth period of 90 days, they measure the height of the corn stalk in the center of each plot.\n\nTo analyze the data, they perform a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The analysis yields two key quantities: the mean square between groups ($MSB$), which quantifies the variation in mean height between the different fertilizer groups, and the mean square within groups ($MSW$), which quantifies the average variation in height within each fertilizer group. The scientists observe that the calculated $MSB$ is substantially smaller than the calculated $MSW$.\n\nBased on this specific finding ($MSB \\ll MSW$), what is the most appropriate statistical conclusion?\n\nA.
