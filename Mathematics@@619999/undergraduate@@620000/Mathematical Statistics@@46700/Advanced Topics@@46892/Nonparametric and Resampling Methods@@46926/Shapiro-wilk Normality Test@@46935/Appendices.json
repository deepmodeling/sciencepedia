The test will fail to reject the null hypothesis of normality because the resulting distribution is perfectly symmetric, and the Shapiro-Wilk test is primarily sensitive to skewness, not other forms of non-normality.\n\nE. The test will reject the null hypothesis of normality because the sample variance will be much larger than the variance of the component distributions.", "solution": "Let the data-generating process be the equal-weight mixture of two normals with common standard deviation. Write\n$$\nX = Z a + Y,\n$$\nwhere $Z \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ with $\\mathbb{P}(Z=1)=\\mathbb{P}(Z=-1)=\\frac{1}{2}$, $a>0$ is the magnitude of the component means, and $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,s^{2})$ is independent of $Z$. In the problem, $a=4$ and $s^{2}=1$, but the reasoning below is general.\n\nUnder the Shapiro-Wilk test, the null hypothesis is\n$$\nH_{0}:\\ \\text{the data come from } \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^{2}) \\text{ for some } \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R},\\ \\sigma^{2}>0.\n$$\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test statistic can be written as\n$$\nW=\\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}\\,x_{(n+1-i)}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $x_{(1)}\\leq \\cdots \\leq x_{(n)}$ are the order statistics of the sample, $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, and the coefficients $a_{i}$ depend on the expected normal order statistics. For data from a single normal distribution, $W$ is close to $1$; systematic departures from normality (including bimodality) make the ordered sample deviate from the linear pattern expected under normality, driving $W$ significantly below $1$.\n\nFirst, the distribution of $X$ is not normal unless $a=0$. Its density is the sum of two separated normal component densities, which is bimodal for $a$ sufficiently large relative to $s$. Consequently, even though each component is normal, their mixture is not a single normal distribution, so the null hypothesis is false in the data-generating process.\n\nSecond, to assess tail behavior and address option B, compute the second and fourth moments. Using independence and symmetry,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X]=0,\\qquad \\mathbb{E}[X^{2}]=a^{2}+s^{2}.\n$$\nFor the fourth moment, expand $(Za+Y)^{4}$ and take expectations; odd terms vanish and $\\mathbb{E}[Y^{4}]=3s^{4}$ for a normal:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X^{4}]=a^{4}+6a^{2}s^{2}+3s^{4}.\n$$\nThe kurtosis relative to a normal with the same variance is\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X^{4}]}{\\left(\\mathbb{E}[X^{2}]\\right)^{2}}=\\frac{a^{4}+6a^{2}s^{2}+3s^{4}}{(a^{2}+s^{2})^{2}}.\n$$\nThe excess kurtosis is\n$$\n\\gamma_{2}=\\frac{a^{4}+6a^{2}s^{2}+3s^{4}}{(a^{2}+s^{2})^{2}}-3=\\frac{-2a^{4}}{(a^{2}+s^{2})^{2}}<0 \\quad \\text{for } a\\neq 0.\n$$\nThus the mixture is platykurtic relative to a single normal with the same variance; it does not have heavier tails than that normal. Therefore, the justification in option B (heavier tails) is incorrect.\n\nThird, address option E: although the mixture has variance $\\mathbb{V}[X]=a^{2}+s^{2}$, the Shapiro-Wilk null allows any $\\sigma^{2}>0$ and estimates it from the sample. A variance being larger than the component variance does not by itself cause rejection; the issue is the non-normal shape (here, bimodality), not the magnitude of variance. Hence E’s justification is incorrect.\n\nFourth, address option D: the Shapiro-Wilk test is sensitive to a broad class of departures from normality, not only skewness. Symmetry alone does not guarantee failure to reject; symmetric bimodal distributions typically yield an S-shaped deviation in a normal Q-Q plot and reduce $W$.\n\nFinally, because the mixture is bimodal and not normal, a large sample will produce ordered statistics that deviate systematically from the straight-line pattern expected under a single normal distribution. In a Q-Q plot, this manifests as an S-shaped curve: central quantiles and tail quantiles do not align linearly with normal quantiles when the population is bimodal. Consequently, the Shapiro-Wilk statistic will be significantly less than $1$, and the test will reject $H_{0}$ at a standard significance level with high probability as sample size grows.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate outcome and justification is that the test rejects normality due to the bimodal-induced S-shaped departure from a single normal’s quantiles.\n\nOption analysis summary:\n- A is false: mixtures of separated normals are not normal.\n- B is false: the mixture is platykurtic relative to a normal with the same variance; “heavier tails” is incorrect.\n- C is correct: bimodality induces an S-shaped Q-Q deviation, lowering $W$ and causing rejection.\n- D is false: Shapiro-Wilk detects non-normality beyond skewness.\n- E is false: the null allows any variance; rejection is due to shape, not large variance per se.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1954962"}]}
