They build a multiple linear regression model with several predictor variables. To assess multicollinearity, they focus on a specific predictor, $X_j$.

To investigate this, they compute the sample correlation coefficient between the marketing expenditure and the sales team size from their dataset, finding it to be $r = 0.960$.\n\nTo quantify the severity of this multicollinearity, calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for either of these predictors.
