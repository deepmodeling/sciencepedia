It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem consists of three tasks: defining a formula `Halt_e(x, y)`, justifying its properties and relation to computably enumerable sets, and calculating a specific run code.\n\n### Task 1: Definition of the formula $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y)$\n\nWe are asked to define a formula $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y)$ in the language of first-order Peano Arithmetic (PA), which contains symbols for addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\\cdot$), that expresses \"$y$ is the code of a halting computation of machine $e$ on input $x$\". The formula must be in the $\\Sigma_1$ class of the arithmetical hierarchy.\n\nA number $y$ encodes a halting computation if it is a prime-power code for a finite sequence of configuration codes, $\\langle c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_m \\rangle$, satisfying the following conditions:\n1.  The sequence is non-empty.\n2.  The first configuration $c_0$ is the initial configuration for the given input $x$. For a deterministic register machine, the initial configuration is conventionally $(\\mathit{ip}_{start}, x)$. We assume the initial instruction pointer $\\mathit{ip}_{start}$ is $1$.\n3.  The last configuration $c_m$ is a halting configuration, meaning its instruction pointer is $0$.\n4.  Each subsequent configuration $c_{i+1}$ in the sequence is obtained from the preceding one $c_i$ by a single step of the machine $e$'s execution, as defined by its transition relation.\n\nTo formalize this, we build the formula $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y)$ from several auxiliary predicates. These predicates are definable in PA. Key to this is the definability of functions like primality testing, the $i$-th prime function ($p_i$), and exponentiation ($a^b$). While the language of PA only includes $+$ and $\\cdot$, these concepts are indeed definable. In particular, exponentiation is $\\Delta_1$-definable. All primitive recursive functions and relations are $\\Delta_1$-definable in PA. The relation expressed by $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y)$ is primitive recursive, which guarantees its $\\Delta_1$-definability, and hence the existence of an equivalent $\\Sigma_1$ formula.\n\nLet's define the components of the formula.\n\n**Auxiliary Predicates:**\n\n-   $\\mathrm{IsPrime}(p)$: A formula stating that $p$ is a prime number.\n    $\\mathrm{IsPrime}(p) \\equiv p > 1 \\land \\forall d < p (d > 1 \\to \\neg(\\exists k < p (d \\cdot k = p)))$. This is a $\\Delta_0$ formula.\n-   $\\mathrm{NthPrime}(i, p)$: A formula stating that $p$ is the $i$-th prime number ($p_i$). This is $\\Delta_1$-definable.\n-   $\\mathrm{exp}(n, p, k)$: A formula stating that $k$ is the exponent of the prime $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$.\n    $\\mathrm{exp}(n, p, k) \\equiv p^k | n \\land \\neg(p^{k+1} | n)$. This is $\\Delta_1$ due to exponentiation.\n-   $\\mathrm{GetElem}(y, i, c)$: A formula stating that $c$ is the $(i+1)$-th element in the sequence encoded by $y$. Per the problem's encoding, this means $c+1$ is the exponent of $p_i$.\n    $\\mathrm{GetElem}(y, i, c) \\equiv \\exists p (\\mathrm{NthPrime}(i, p) \\land \\mathrm{exp}(y, p, c+1))$.\n-   $\\mathrm{Len}(y, m)$: A formula stating the length of the sequence coded by $y$ is $m$.\n    $\\mathrm{Len}(y, m) \\equiv \\exists p, q (\\mathrm{NthPrime}(m-1, p) \\land p|y \\land \\mathrm{NthPrime}(m, q) \\land \\neg(q|y))$.\n\n**Configuration Predicates:**\n\n-   $\\mathrm{ConfCode}(ip, r, c)$: A formula stating that $c$ is the code for the configuration $(\\mathit{ip}, r)$.\n    $\\mathrm{ConfCode}(ip, r, c) \\equiv c = 2^{\\mathit{ip}+1} \\cdot 3^{r+1}$.\n-   $\\mathrm{GetIP}(c, ip)$: A formula extracting the instruction pointer from a configuration code $c$.\n    $\\mathrm{GetIP}(c, ip) \\equiv \\mathrm{exp}(c, 2, \\mathit{ip}+1)$.\n-   $\\mathrm{GetR}(c, r)$: A formula extracting the register value from a configuration code $c$.\n    $\\mathrm{GetR}(c, r) \\equiv \\mathrm{exp}(c, 3, r+1)$.\n\n**Computation Step Predicates:**\n\n-   $\\mathrm{Transition}_e(c, c')$: A formula stating that configuration $c'$ follows from $c$ in one step of machine $e$. This is a disjunction over all instructions of $e$. For a machine with $k$ instructions, this has the form:\n    $\\mathrm{Transition}_e(c, c') \\equiv \\bigvee_{j=1}^{k} \\Phi_j(c, c')$, where $\\Phi_j$ formalizes the effect of instruction $j$. Each $\\Phi_j$ is of the form $\\exists \\mathit{ip}, r, \\mathit{ip}', r' (\\mathrm{GetIP}(c, \\mathit{ip}) \\land \\mathrm{GetR}(c, r) \\land \\mathit{ip}=j \\land (\\text{logic for instruction } j) \\land \\mathrm{ConfCode}(\\mathit{ip}', r', c'))$.\n\n**The Full Formula $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y)$:**\n\nCombining these, we define $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y)$ as follows. It asserts that there exists a length $m+1$ for the computation sequence, and for all steps $i$ from $0$ to $m-1$, the transition from configuration $i$ to $i+1$ is valid.\n\n$\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y) \\equiv$\n$\\exists m > 0 \\, \\Big( \\mathrm{Len}(y, m+1) \\land $\n$\\quad \\exists c_0 \\, \\big( \\mathrm{GetElem}(y, 0, c_0) \\land \\mathrm{ConfCode}(1, x, c_0) \\big) \\land $\n$\\quad \\exists c_m \\, \\big( \\mathrm{GetElem}(y, m, c_m) \\land \\exists \\mathit{ip}_m (\\mathrm{GetIP}(c_m, \\mathit{ip}_m) \\land \\mathit{ip}_m = 0) \\big) \\land $\n$\\quad \\forall i < m \\, \\exists c_i, c_{i+1} \\, \\big( \\mathrm{GetElem}(y, i, c_i) \\land \\mathrm{GetElem}(y, i+1, c_{i+1}) \\land \\mathrm{Transition}_e(c_i, c_{i+1}) \\big) \\Big)$\n\nAll quantifiers in this formula are bounded (e.g., $m < y$, $c_i < y$), except for those hidden within the auxiliary predicates (notably exponentiation). The relation is primitive recursive, so it is $\\Delta_1$. According to the definition of the arithmetic hierarchy, a $\\Delta_1$ formula is provably equivalent to a $\\Sigma_1$ formula. Therefore, this construction defines the desired relation, and an equivalent $\\Sigma_1$ formula exists.\n\n### Task 2: Justification of $\\Sigma_1$ Definability and Representability\n\n**$\\Sigma_1$ Definability:** A formula is $\\Sigma_1$ if it is of the form $\\exists z_1 \\dots \\exists z_k \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is a $\\Delta_0$ formula (all its quantifiers are bounded). The predicate $R(x,y) \\equiv$ \"$y$ is the code of a halting computation of machine $e$ on input $x$\" is a decidable predicate. Given $x$ and $y$, one can mechanically check in a finite number of steps whether $y$ has the required properties. Such a predicate is called \"primitive recursive\". It is a fundamental result of computability theory and logic, established by Gödel, that every primitive recursive relation is definable in Peano Arithmetic by a formula that is $\\Delta_1$. A formula is $\\Delta_1$ if it is equivalent in PA to both a $\\Sigma_1$ formula and a $\\Pi_1$ formula. Thus, our predicate $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x,y)$ is $\\Sigma_1$-definable. The semi-formal definition provided above is a sketch of the proof of this fact.\n\n**Relation to Computably Enumerable Sets:** This $\\Sigma_1$ definability is the foundation for representing all computably enumerable (CE) sets within PA.\n1.  A set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ is computably enumerable if there exists a register machine $e$ that halts on input $x$ if and only if $x \\in S$.\n2.  The statement \"machine $e$ halts on input $x$\" is equivalent to asserting the existence of a corresponding halting computation.\n3.  In our formal system, this translates to: \"there exists a number $y$ that is the code of a halting computation of machine $e$ on input $x$\".\n4.  This can be written using our defined predicate as the formula $\\exists y \\, \\mathrm{Halt}_e(x, y)$.\n5.  Since $\\mathrm{Halt}_e(x, y)$ is definable by a $\\Sigma_1$ formula (as argued above), say $\\psi(x, y)$, the formula $\\exists y \\, \\psi(x, y)$ is also $\\Sigma_1$.\nThis establishes a direct correspondence: for every CE set $S$, there is a $\\Sigma_1$ formula $\\Phi_S(x)$ of the form $\\exists y \\, \\mathrm{Halt}_e(x, y)$ such that $x \\in S \\iff \\mathbb{N} \\models \\Phi_S(x)$. This shows that the class of $\\Sigma_1$-definable sets is precisely the class of computably enumerable sets.\nFurthermore, the $\\Sigma_1$ Soundness and Completeness Theorems for PA state that for any $\\Sigma_1$ sentence $\\phi$, $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\phi \\iff PA \\vdash \\phi$. This means that for any $n \\in S$, not only is $\\Phi_S(\\bar{n})$ true, but it is also provable in PA. This property is known as $\\Sigma_1$-representability of CE sets in PA.\n\n### Task 3: Calculation of the Run Code\n\nWe are given a specific machine $e$ and input $x=1$.\n-   **Machine $e$**:\n    1.  Instruction at label $1$: Increment the register, jump to label $2$.\n    2.  Instruction at label $2$: Halt (i.e., jump to label $0$).\n-   **Input**: $x=1$.\n\nWe trace the computation, which is a sequence of configurations $(\\mathit{ip}, r)$.\n1.  **Initial Configuration ($c_0$)**: The computation starts at instruction label $1$ with the input $x=1$ in the register.\n    $c_0 = (\\mathit{ip}=1, r=1)$.\n2.  **Step 1**: Execute instruction $1$. The register $r$ is incremented ($r \\to 1+1=2$) and the instruction pointer $\\mathit{ip}$ jumps to $2$. The next configuration is:\n    $c_1 = (\\mathit{ip}=2, r=2)$.\n3.  **Step 2**: Execute instruction $2$. This is a halt instruction, which we model as setting the instruction pointer to $0$. The register value remains unchanged. The final configuration is:\n    $c_2 = (\\mathit{ip}=0, r=2)$.\nThe machine has halted since $\\mathit{ip}=0$. The full computation trace is the sequence $\\langle c_0, c_1, c_2 \\rangle$.\n\nNext, we calculate the code for each configuration using $\\mathrm{ConfCode}(\\mathit{ip}, r) = 2^{\\mathit{ip}+1} \\cdot 3^{r+1}$.\n-   For $c_0 = (1, 1)$: Code $a_0 = \\mathrm{ConfCode}(1, 1) = 2^{1+1} \\cdot 3^{1+1} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 4 \\cdot 9 = 36$.\n-   For $c_1 = (2, 2)$: Code $a_1 = \\mathrm{ConfCode}(2, 2) = 2^{2+1} \\cdot 3^{2+1} = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 = 8 \\cdot 27 = 216$.\n-   For $c_2 = (0, 2)$: Code $a_2 = \\mathrm{ConfCode}(0, 2) = 2^{0+1} \\cdot 3^{2+1} = 2^1 \\cdot 3^3 = 2 \\cdot 27 = 54$.\n\nThe sequence of configuration codes is $\\langle a_0, a_1, a_2 \\rangle = \\langle 36, 216, 54 \\rangle$.\n\nFinally, we compute the run code $y$ using the formula $\\mathrm{RunCode} = \\prod_{i=0}^{m} p_i^{a_i+1}$, where $m=2$. The primes are $p_0=2$, $p_1=3$, $p_2=5$.\nThe exponents are $a_i+1$:\n-   For $i=0$: exponent is $a_0+1 = 36+1 = 37$.\n-   For $i=1$: exponent is $a_1+1 = 216+1 = 217$.\n-   For $i=2$: exponent is $a_2+1 = 54+1 = 55$.\n\nThe run code $y$ is the product of these prime powers:\n$$y = p_0^{a_0+1} \\cdot p_1^{a_1+1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2+1} = 2^{37} \\cdot 3^{217} \\cdot 5^{55}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^{37} \\cdot 3^{217} \\cdot 5^{55}}\n$$", "id": "3042000"}, {"introduction": "After establishing that computations can be encoded as numbers, the next step is to prove the foundational result that Peano Arithmetic (PA) can formally represent all primitive recursive functions.

Representability of Initial Functions**\n\nA function $f$ is representable in PA if there's a formula $\\varphi_f(\\bar{x},y)$ such that PA proves $\\forall \\bar{x} \\exists!y \\varphi_f(\\bar{x},y)$ and for all $\\bar{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}^k$, PA proves $\\varphi_f(\\bar{\\overline{n}}, \\overline{f(\\bar{n})})$. The existence and uniqueness of $y$ for a given $\\bar{x}$ are crucial.\n\n-   **Zero function**: $Z(x_{1},\\dots,x_{k})=0$. This function is represented by the formula $\\varphi_{Z}(\\bar{x},y) \\equiv y=0$.\n    -   PA trivially proves $\\forall \\bar{x} \\exists!y (y=0)$, as $y$ must be $0$.\n    -   For any $\\bar{n}\\in\\mathbb{N}^k$, $Z(\\bar{n})=0$. We need to show PA proves $\\varphi_{Z}(\\bar{\\overline{n}},\\overline{0})$, which is $\\overline{0}=0$. The numeral $\\overline{0}$ is the constant symbol $0$, so this is the trivial logical truth $0=0$.\n\n-   **Successor function**: $S(x)=x+1$. This function is represented by the formula $\\varphi_{S}(x,y) \\equiv y=S(x)$.\n    -   For any term $t$, PA proves $\\exists!y (y=t)$. So $\\forall x \\exists!y (y=S(x))$ is provable.\n    -   For any $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, $S(n)=n+1$. We need to show PA proves $\\varphi_{S}(\\overline{n},\\overline{n+1})$. This is the formula $\\overline{n+1} = S(\\overline{n})$. By definition of the numeral, $\\overline{n+1}$ is the term $S(\\overline{n})$, so this is the statement $S(\\overline{n}) = S(\\overline{n})$, a logical identity.\n\n-   **Projection functions**: $U_{i}^{k}(x_{1},\\dots,x_{k})=x_i$. This function is represented by the formula $\\varphi_{U_i^k}(\\bar{x},y) \\equiv y=x_i$.\n    -   PA proves $\\forall \\bar{x} \\exists!y (y=x_i)$.\n    -   For any $\\bar{n}=(n_1,\\dots,n_k)\\in\\mathbb{N}^k$, $U_i^k(\\bar{n})=n_i$. We need to show PA proves $\\varphi_{U_i^k}(\\bar{\\overline{n}},\\overline{n_i})$, which is $\\overline{n_i}= \\overline{n_i}$, a logical identity.\n\nThus, all initial functions are representable in PA.\n\n**2. Closure under Composition**\n\nLet $h(\\bar{x}) = f(g_{1}(\\bar{x}),\\dots,g_{m}(\\bar{x}))$. Assume that $f$ and each $g_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,m$ are representable in PA by formulas $\\varphi_f(y_1,\\dots,y_m,z)$ and $\\varphi_{g_i}(\\bar{x},y_i)$, respectively. We define the representing formula for $h$ as:\n$$ \\varphi_h(\\bar{x},z) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\left( \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} \\varphi_{g_i}(\\bar{x}, y_i) \\land \\varphi_f(y_1, \\dots, y_m, z) \\right) $$\nWe must show this formula represents $h$. For any tuple of numerals $\\bar{\\overline{n}}$:\n-   **Correctness and Existence**: Let $k_i=g_i(\\bar{n})$ for each $i$, and let $p=f(k_1,\\dots,k_m)=h(\\bar{n})$. By the representability of $g_i$ and $f$, PA proves $\\varphi_{g_i}(\\bar{\\overline{n}},\\overline{k_i})$ for each $i$, and PA proves $\\varphi_f(\\overline{k_1},\\dots,\\overline{k_m},\\overline{p})$. By instantiating the existential quantifiers in $\\varphi_h(\\bar{\\overline{n}},\\overline{p})$ with the numerals $\\overline{k_1},\\dots,\\overline{k_m}$, we see that PA proves $\\varphi_h(\\bar{\\overline{n}},\\overline{p})$. This establishes correctness and implies existence for $\\exists z \\varphi_h(\\bar{\\overline{n}},z)$.\n\n-   **Uniqueness**: Assume PA proves $\\varphi_h(\\bar{\\overline{n}},z_1)$ and $\\varphi_h(\\bar{\\overline{n}},z_2)$. We must show PA proves $z_1=z_2$.\n    The premises are:\n    $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\bigwedge_i \\varphi_{g_i}(\\bar{\\overline{n}}, y_i) \\land \\varphi_f(y_1, \\dots, y_m, z_1))$\n    $\\exists y'_1 \\dots \\exists y'_m (\\bigwedge_i \\varphi_{g_i}(\\bar{\\overline{n}}, y'_i) \\land \\varphi_f(y'_1, \\dots, y'_m, z_2))$\n    By the uniqueness property for each $g_i$, PA proves that for any $y_i, y'_i$, if $\\varphi_{g_i}(\\bar{\\overline{n}},y_i)$ and $\\varphi_{g_i}(\\bar{\\overline{n}},y'_i)$ hold, then $y_i=y'_i$. Therefore, PA proves $y_i=y'_i$ for all $i=1,\\dots,m$.\n    Substituting these equalities, the second premise implies $\\varphi_f(y_1, \\dots, y_m, z_2)$.\n    Now we have $\\varphi_f(y_1, \\dots, y_m, z_1)$ and $\\varphi_f(y_1, \\dots, y_m, z_2)$. By the uniqueness property for $f$, PA proves $z_1=z_2$.\n    Thus, PA proves $\\exists! z \\varphi_h(\\bar{\\overline{n}},z)$. The set of representable functions is closed under composition.\n\n**3. Closure under Primitive Recursion**\n\nLet $h$ be defined by primitive recursion from $f$ and $g$:\n$h(0, \\bar{x}) = f(\\bar{x})$\n$h(S(y), \\bar{x}) = g(y, h(y, \\bar{x}), \\bar{x})$\nAssume $f$ and $g$ are representable by $\\varphi_f(\\bar{x},z)$ and $\\varphi_g(y,u,\\bar{x},v)$. The value $h(y,\\bar{x})$ can be seen as the $(y+1)$-th term of a sequence whose terms are defined recursively. We use the provided sequence-coding machinery to formalize this. The relation $v=\\beta(s,i)$ is definable by a formula $\\psi_{\\beta}(s,i,v)$. The formula $\\varphi_h(y,\\bar{x},z)$ states that there exists a sequence $s$ of length $S(y)$ (i.e., $y+1$) such that its first element is $f(\\bar{x})$, subsequent elements are generated by $g$, and $z$ is the last element.\n$$\n\\varphi_h(y,\\bar{x},z) \\equiv \\exists s \\Bigg( \\mathrm{Seq}(s, S(y)) \\land \\exists v_0 \\bigg( \\psi_{\\beta}(s,0,v_0) \\land \\varphi_f(\\bar{x},v_0) \\bigg) \\land \\\\ \\forall i < y \\bigg( \\exists u \\exists v \\Big( \\psi_{\\beta}(s,i,u) \\land \\psi_{\\beta}(s,S(i),v) \\land \\varphi_g(i,u,\\bar{x},v) \\Big) \\bigg) \\land \\psi_{\\beta}(s,y,z) \\Bigg)\n$$\n-   **Correctness and Existence**: For any $n_y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\bar{n}_x \\in \\mathbb{N}^k$, consider the finite sequence of values $a_i = h(i, \\bar{n}_x)$ for $i=0,\\dots,n_y$. By the assumed property of the $\\beta$-function, there exists a number $s_0$ that codes this sequence, i.e., PA proves $\\mathrm{Seq}(\\overline{s_0}, S(\\overline{n_y}))$ and $\\psi_\\beta(\\overline{s_0}, \\bar{i}, \\overline{a_i})$ for $i \\le n_y$. By the representability of $f$ and $g$ and the definition of $h$, PA can prove that this sequence satisfies the recursive conditions. Specifically, PA proves $\\varphi_f(\\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, \\overline{a_0})$ and $\\varphi_g(\\bar{i}, \\overline{a_i}, \\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, \\overline{a_{i+1}})$ for $i<n_y$. Thus, PA proves that $\\overline{s_0}$ satisfies the existentially quantified part of $\\varphi_h(\\overline{n_y}, \\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, \\overline{a_{n_y}})$. This shows that PA proves $\\varphi_h(\\overline{n_y}, \\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, \\overline{h(n_y,\\bar{n}_x)})$, establishing correctness and existence.\n\n-   **Uniqueness**: Assume PA proves $\\varphi_h(\\overline{n_y},\\bar{\\overline{n}_x},z_1)$ and $\\varphi_h(\\overline{n_y},\\bar{\\overline{n}_x},z_2)$. This implies the existence of two coding numbers, say $s_1$ and $s_2$. We must show $z_1=z_2$. We prove by induction (within PA) on $i \\le \\overline{n_y}$ that the sequences coded by $s_1$ and $s_2$ are element-wise identical. Let $v_1(i)$ be the $i$-th element of the sequence coded by $s_1$, and $v_2(i)$ for $s_2$.\n    -   Base case $i=0$: From $\\varphi_h$, we have $\\varphi_f(\\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, v_1(0))$ and $\\varphi_f(\\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, v_2(0))$. By uniqueness for $f$, PA proves $v_1(0)=v_2(0)$.\n    -   Inductive step: Assume $v_1(i)=v_2(i)$ for $i < \\overline{n_y}$. Let this common value be $u$. From $\\varphi_h$, we have $\\varphi_g(\\bar{i}, u, \\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, v_1(S(i)))$ and $\\varphi_g(\\bar{i}, u, \\bar{\\overline{n}_x}, v_2(S(i)))$. By uniqueness for $g$, PA proves $v_1(S(i))=v_2(S(i))$.\n    -   By the induction schema of PA, it proves $\\forall i \\le \\overline{n_y} (v_1(i)=v_2(i))$.\n    -   In particular, for $i=\\overline{n_y}$, we have $v_1(\\overline{n_y})=v_2(\\overline{n_y})$. From the definition of $\\varphi_h$, we have $z_1 = v_1(\\overline{n_y})$ and $z_2 = v_2(\\overline{n_y})$. Therefore, PA proves $z_1=z_2$. Uniqueness is established. The set of representable functions is closed under primitive recursion.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe set of primitive recursive functions is defined as the smallest set containing the initial functions (zero, successor, projections) and closed under the operations of composition and primitive recursion. We have demonstrated that:\n1.  All initial functions are representable in PA.\n2.  The set of functions representable in PA is closed under composition.\n3.  The set of functions representable in PA is closed under primitive recursion.\n\nBy the principle of structural induction, it follows that every primitive recursive function is representable in Peano Arithmetic.\n\n**5. Illustration: Representing Formula for Addition**\n\nThe addition function $\\mathrm{add}(x,y)=x+y$ is primitive recursive. Its definition is:\n-   $\\mathrm{add}(0,y) = y$\n-   $\\mathrm{add}(S(x),y) = S(\\mathrm{add}(x,y))$\nThis fits the schema of primitive recursion, with $f(y)=y$ (a projection function) and $g(x,u,y) = S(u)$ (composition of successor and projection). Following the proof above, we could construct a complex $\\Sigma_1$ formula for $\\mathrm{add}(x,y,z)$ using sequence coding.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the language of arithmetic includes the symbol `$+$`. This allows for a much simpler and more direct representing formula. We can propose the formula:\n$$ \\varphi_{\\mathrm{add}}(x,y,z) \\equiv z = x+y $$\nLet's verify this formula represents the addition function.\n1.  **Existence and Uniqueness**: PA must prove $\\forall x \\forall y \\exists!z (z=x+y)$. For any terms $t_1, t_2$, the term $t_1+t_2$ is well-formed. The statement $\\exists z (z=t_1+t_2)$ is a logical axiom. Uniqueness, $\\forall z_1, z_2 ((z_1=t_1+t_2 \\land z_2=t_1+t_2) \\to z_1=z_2)$, follows from the properties of equality. Thus, PA proves this property.\n2.  **Correctness**: For any natural numbers $n, m$, we must show PA proves $\\varphi_{\\mathrm{add}}(\\overline{n},\\overline{m},\\overline{n+m})$, which is the statement $\\overline{n+m} = \\overline{n}+\\overline{m}$. The axioms of PA for addition are precisely what is needed to prove this equality for all numerals. One can show by induction on $\\overline{m}$ that PA proves $\\overline{n}+\\overline{m}=\\overline{n+m}$.\n\nTherefore, $z=x+y$ is a valid (and maximally simple) formula representing the addition function in the given language. The \"representing term\" used inside this formula, which expresses the value of the function for inputs $x$ and $y$, is the term $x+y$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x+y}\n$$", "id": "3042040"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that Peano Arithmetic is strong enough to represent computable functions, but what gives it this power?

The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nFirst principles analysis:\nA total computable function $f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ is one for which a terminating algorithm exists for every input $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. A standard way to formalize this is to create a formula $\\varphi_f(x,y)$ that expresses \"the computation for function $f$ on input $x$ halts with output $y$\". This can be written as $\\exists z \\, \\psi(x,y,z)$, where $\\psi$ is a formula with bounded quantifiers ($\\Delta_0$) describing the properties of a computation trace coded by $z$. Thus, $\\varphi_f(x,y)$ is a $\\Sigma_1$ formula.\n\nThe \"global existence claim\" or statement of totality for $f$ is $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$. Substituting the form of $\\varphi_f$, this becomes $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\exists z\\,\\psi(x,y,z)$. This is a $\\Pi_2$ sentence, as stated in the problem's foundational facts.\n\nThe key difference between $Q$ and $PA$ lies in their ability to prove such sentences.\n\n- **Robinson Arithmetic ($Q$):** $Q$ is famously $\\Sigma_1$-complete. This means that for any true $\\Sigma_1$ sentence $S$, $Q \\vdash S$.\n    - For any total computable function $f$ and any specific natural number $n$, let $m=f(n)$. The statement \"the computation of $f$ on input $n$ yields output $m$\" is a specific, verifiable fact. The formula representing it, $\\varphi_f(\\overline{n}, \\overline{m})$, is a true $\\Sigma_1$ sentence. Therefore, $Q \\vdash \\varphi_f(\\overline{n}, \\overline{m})$.\n    - Likewise, for any given $n$, the statement \"there exists an output for the computation of $f$ on input $n$\", formalized as $\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(\\overline{n},y)$, is also a true $\\Sigma_1$ sentence. Consequently, $Q \\vdash \\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(\\overline{n},y)$.\n    - This shows that all total computable functions are weakly representable in $Q$ according to the provided definition.\n    - However, $Q$ lacks the principle of induction. This severely limits its ability to prove universal statements. It cannot, in general, prove the $\\Pi_2$ sentence $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$, as this would require generalizing from individual instances, which is the role of induction.\n\n- **Peano Arithmetic ($PA$):** $PA$ extends $Q$ with the Induction Schema. This schema allows for proofs of universal statements, $\\forall x \\, P(x)$, by proving a base case $P(0)$ and an inductive step $\\forall x (P(x) \\to P(x+1))$.\n    - For any function defined by primitive recursion (a large and important class of total computable functions), the proof of its totality is naturally an inductive proof. $PA$ is precisely strong enough to carry out these proofs.\n    - Therefore, for any primitive recursive function $f$, $PA$ can prove its totality: $PA \\vdash \\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$.\n    - Uniqueness, $\\forall x \\forall y_1 \\forall y_2 \\, (\\varphi_f(x,y_1) \\land \\varphi_f(x,y_2) \\to y_1=y_2)$, is also provable in $PA$ (and even in $Q$) for standard representations.\n    - Thus, $PA$ strongly represents all primitive recursive functions, and more generally, all functions that are provably total within $PA$.\n\nThe divergence between the theories is that $PA$'s induction schema allows it to prove the universal ($\\Pi_2$) totality statement, whereas $Q$ is generally limited to proving the individual ($\\Sigma_1$) instances of computation.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In $PA$, any function that is provably total in $PA$ (for instance, any primitive recursive function) has a representing formula $\\varphi_f(x,y)$ with $PA \\vdash \\forall x\\,\\exists! y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$, while in $Q$ one typically has only instance-wise proofs $Q \\vdash \\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(\\overline{n},y)$ for each $\\overline{n}$; $Q$ does not, in general, prove $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the situation. The part about $PA$ is correct by definition of a provably total function in $PA$, and it correctly includes primitive recursive functions as an example. The part about $Q$ correctly states that it can prove existence for each specific instance $\\overline{n}$ (due to its $\\Sigma_1$-completeness) but cannot, in general, prove the universal statement ($\\forall x...$) due to its lack of induction.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because $Q$ proves all true $\\Sigma_1$ sentences, it also proves $\\forall x\\,\\exists! y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$ for every primitive recursive $f$.**\nThis statement makes a fallacious inference. The premise, \"$Q$ proves all true $\\Sigma_1$ sentences\", is correct. However, the conclusion concerns the sentence $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$, which, as established, is a $\\Pi_2$ sentence. The ability to prove all true $\\Sigma_1$ sentences does not imply the ability to prove all true $\\Pi_2$ sentences. In fact, Gödel's incompleteness theorem implies that no sufficiently strong, consistent, recursively axiomatized theory can prove all true $\\Pi_2$ sentences. $Q$ fails to prove this for most primitive recursive functions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Weak representability fails in $Q$ for some total computable functions $f$, since $Q$ cannot even show $\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(\\overline{n},y)$ for fixed inputs $\\overline{n}$.**\nThis statement is false. As demonstrated in the preliminary analysis, $Q$ *does* prove $\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(\\overline{n},y)$ for every total computable function $f$ and every numeral $\\overline{n}$. This is a direct consequence of the fact that $\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(\\overline{n},y)$ is a true $\\Sigma_1$ sentence and $Q$ is $\\Sigma_1$-complete. Consequently, weak representability (as defined in the problem) holds in $Q$ for all total computable functions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In $PA$, even partial computable functions $g:\\mathbb{N}\\rightharpoonup\\mathbb{N}$ admit strong representability: there is $\\psi_g(x,y)$ with $PA \\vdash \\forall x\\,\\exists! y\\,\\psi_g(x,y)$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Strong representability requires proving $PA \\vdash \\forall x\\,\\exists! y\\,\\psi_g(x,y)$. The quantifier $\\forall x$ asserts that the function is defined for all inputs $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, i.e., that the function is total. A partial function $g$ that is not total is, by definition, undefined for at least one input $x_0$. A sound theory like $PA$ cannot prove that an output exists for an input where the function is undefined. Therefore, $PA$ cannot strongly represent strictly partial computable functions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The divergence arises because $PA$ can use the Induction Schema to verify that definitions by primitive recursion yield total functions (turning $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(x,y)$ into theorems), whereas $Q$ lacks induction and is confined to proving each true instance $\\exists y\\,\\varphi_f(\\overline{n},y)$ separately.**\nThis statement provides the correct causal explanation for the divergence. The power of $PA$ to prove totality for a wide class of functions (including all primitive recursive ones) stems directly from its Induction Schema. Conversely, the limitation of $Q$ to proving only specific instances of computation, despite being able to represent all computable functions, is due to its lack of induction. It relies on its $\\Sigma_1$-completeness to handle individual cases but cannot generalize. This statement accurately describes the underlying reasons for the phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth options A and E correctly describe the divergence. Option A states the facts of the divergence, and Option E explains the mechanism behind it. Both are valid and correct descriptions as requested by the prompt.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "3050618"}]}
