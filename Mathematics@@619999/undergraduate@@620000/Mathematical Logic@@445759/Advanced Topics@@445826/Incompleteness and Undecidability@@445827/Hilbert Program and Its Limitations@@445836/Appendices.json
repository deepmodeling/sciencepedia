By applying the technique of quantifier elimination, you will algorithmically determine the truth of the sentence, gaining a concrete understanding of what it means for a theory to be decidable. [@problem_id:3044041]", "problem": "Hilbert’s program sought finitistic proofs of consistency and effective decision procedures for formal theories of arithmetic. Working within the decidable fragment known as Presburger arithmetic (the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition), use formal quantifier elimination to decide the truth of a specific sentence. Presburger arithmetic is formulated in the language $L = \\{0,1,+,<\\}$ of First-Order Logic (FOL), interpreting symbols over the standard structure $(\\mathbb{N},+,0,1,<)$, where $\\mathbb{N}$ denotes the natural numbers including $0$. In this setting, multiplication is not a primitive symbol and is disallowed except as repeated addition by a fixed numeral (for example, $y+y$ is permitted but $x \\cdot y$ is not).\n\nConsider the $L$-sentence\n$$\n\\varphi \\;:=\\; \\forall x \\,\\exists y \\,\\big( y + y = x + x \\;\\land\\; y < x + 1 \\big).\n$$\n\nStarting only from the foundational axioms and properties valid in Presburger arithmetic—such as associativity, commutativity, and cancellativity of addition, the totality and monotonicity of the order $<$ with respect to addition, and the standard interpretation of numerals—carry out a complete quantifier elimination for $\\varphi$:\n- eliminate the existential quantifier on $y$ to obtain a quantifier-free $L$-formula in the variable $x$ that is equivalent to $\\exists y \\,( y + y = x + x \\land y < x + 1 )$ over $(\\mathbb{N},+,0,1,<)$;\n- then eliminate the universal quantifier on $x$ (for example, by standard logical transformations in FOL or by direct semantic analysis) to reach a closed quantifier-free $L$-sentence.\n\nDecide whether $\\varphi$ is true in $(\\mathbb{N},+,0,1,<)$ by deriving its quantifier-free equivalent and evaluating it.

Your reasoning must explicitly justify each elimination step using only the permitted operations and properties of Presburger arithmetic, and should make clear how this exemplifies the part of Hilbert’s program concerning decidability and its limitations in stronger arithmetical theories.", "solution": "The problem requires a decision on the truth of the following sentence $\\varphi$ in the first-order theory of Presburger arithmetic, interpreted over the standard model of natural numbers $(\\mathbb{N},+,0,1,<)$:\n$$\n\\varphi \\;:=\\; \\forall x \\,\\exists y \\,\\big( y + y = x + x \\;\\land\\; y < x + 1 \\big).\n$$\nThe decision is to be reached by carrying out a complete quantifier elimination procedure.\n\nThe process of quantifier elimination proceeds from the innermost quantifier outwards. We first consider the subformula $\\psi(x)$ defined by the existential quantifier:\n$$\n\\psi(x) \\;:=\\; \\exists y \\,\\big( y + y = x + x \\;\\land\\; y < x + 1 \\big).\n$$\nOur objective is to find a quantifier-free formula $\\psi'(x)$ that is equivalent to $\\psi(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The formula within the quantifier is a conjunction of two atomic formulas: an equality and a strict inequality.\n\nLet us analyze the equality $y + y = x + x$. In the ordered structure of natural numbers, addition is strictly monotonic. That is, for any $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{N}$, if $a < b$, then $a+c < b+c$. We can use this property to demonstrate that the only solution to $y+y = x+x$ is $y=x$. The proof proceeds by trichotomy, a fundamental property of the total order $<$ on $\\mathbb{N}$:\n1.  Assume $y < x$. By the monotonicity of addition, we can add $y$ to both sides, yielding $y+y < x+y$. Similarly, adding $x$ to both sides of $y < x$ gives $y+x < x+x$. By transitivity of the order $<$, we have $y+y < x+y < x+x$, which implies $y+y < x+x$. This contradicts the condition $y+y = x+x$.\n2.  Assume $x < y$. By a symmetric argument, adding $x$ to both sides gives $x+x < y+x$. Adding $y$ to both sides of $x<y$ gives $x+y < y+y$. By transitivity, $x+x < y+x < y+y$, implying $x+x < y+y$. This also contradicts the condition $y+y = x+x$.\n3.  Since $y < x$ and $x < y$ both lead to contradictions, the only remaining possibility according to the law of trichotomy is $y = x$.\n\nTherefore, within the structure $(\\mathbb{N},+,<)$, the formula $y+y = x+x$ is logically equivalent to the formula $y=x$.\n\nWe can now substitute this equivalence into the formula $\\psi(x)$:\n$$\n\\psi(x) \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; \\exists y \\,\\big( y = x \\;\\land\\; y < x + 1 \\big).\n$$\nThis is a standard logical form. The existence of a $y$ that is equal to $x$ and satisfies a certain property is equivalent to checking if $x$ itself satisfies that property. Formally, for a formula $P(y)$ and a term $t$ in which $y$ is not a free variable, the statement $\\exists y (y=t \\land P(y))$ is equivalent to $P(t)$.\nIn our case, $t$ is $x$ and $P(y)$ is $y < x+1$. Substituting $y=x$ into $P(y)$, we obtain the equivalent quantifier-free formula $\\psi'(x)$:\n$$\n\\psi'(x) \\;:=\\; x < x + 1.\n$$\nA more verbose derivation would maintain the full conjunction: substituting $y=x$ into the original conjunction $(y+y=x+x \\land y<x+1)$ yields $(x+x=x+x \\land x<x+1)$. The part $x+x=x+x$ is an instance of the reflexive property of equality ($t=t$) and is a logical tautology, true for all $x$. Thus, the conjunction is equivalent to its only non-trivial part, $x < x+1$.\n\nSo, we have successfully eliminated the existential quantifier:\n$$\n\\exists y \\,\\big( y + y = x + x \\;\\land\\; y < x + 1 \\big) \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; x < x + 1.\n$$\nNow, we must address the universal quantifier in the original sentence $\\varphi$:\n$$\n\\varphi \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; \\forall x \\,(x < x + 1).\n$$\nTo determine the truth value of this closed sentence, we must evaluate whether the property $x < x+1$ holds for every natural number $x \\in \\mathbb{N}=\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The expression $x+1$ denotes the successor of $x$. A fundamental axiom of arithmetic, derivable from the Peano axioms and the definition of the order relation, is that the successor of any number is strictly greater than the number itself.\n\nWe can prove $\\forall x \\,(x < x+1)$ by induction on $x$:\n-   Base Case ($x=0$): We must show $0 < 0+1$. This is $0 < 1$. In the standard definition of order in Presburger arithmetic, $a < b$ is defined as $\\exists z (\\neg(z=0) \\land a+z=b)$. For $a=0, b=1$, we can choose $z=1$, since $\\neg(1=0)$ and $0+1=1$ are both axioms or elementary theorems of the system. Thus, $0<1$ is true.\n-   Inductive Step: Assume for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that $k < k+1$. We must show that $(k+1) < (k+1)+1$. By the monotonicity of addition with respect to order, we can add $1$ to both sides of the inequality $k < k+1$. This gives $k+1 < (k+1)+1$.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $x < x+1$ is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nConsequently, the universally quantified sentence $\\forall x \\,(x < x+1)$ is true. This implies that the original sentence $\\varphi$ is true in the intended model.\n\nThe successful application of this algorithmic process of quantifier elimination to decide the truth of $\\varphi$ exemplifies a key component of Hilbert's program. The program sought to establish the consistency and decidability of mathematical theories through finitistic means. Presburger arithmetic is a notable success in this regard; it is a consistent, complete, and decidable theory. The existence of a quantifier elimination procedure provides a decision algorithm: for any sentence, we can eliminate all quantifiers to obtain an equivalent sentence without variables (a ground sentence), such as $0<1$, whose truth can be checked directly.\n\nHowever, the power of this method is limited. The addition of multiplication as a general operator, moving from Presburger arithmetic to the stronger Peano arithmetic, renders the theory undecidable, as famously demonstrated by Gödel's incompleteness theorems and further established by the work of Church and Turing. This problem thus illustrates both the success of the formalist approach for certain restricted systems and its ultimate limitations when applied to more expressive theories of arithmetic.\n\nThe final evaluation of the truth of $\\varphi$ reduces to evaluating the truth of a universally true statement. The sentence $\\varphi$ is therefore true. The problem requires this truth value to be represented as the integer $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3044041"}, {"introduction": "The analysis of formal proofs, a field known as proof theory, was the engine of Hilbert's program.

The Hilbert proof is extremely compact but non-analytic; its validity relies on recognizing a pattern, not on a constructive decomposition. Discovering such proofs for complex theorems can be very difficult. In contrast, the LJ proof is analytic and structured. The proof search is guided by the logical connectives of the formula being proved. This structural clarity is crucial for metamathematical analysis, such as proving consistency via cut-elimination, which was a central goal of Hilbert's program.

Because $\\mathrm{Proof}_T$ and $\\ell$ are primitive recursive, $T$ can verify, by a finite computation encoded in $T$ (and already formalizable in weaker systems like PRA), that each such $y$ fails to be a valid proof. Thus $T \\vdash \\lnot \\mathrm{Prov}_T^{\\le n_0}(\\ulcorner H(n_0)\\urcorner)$, and by the fixed-point equivalence, $T \\vdash H(n_0)$.

Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. The first part follows from the consistency-based argument above: $T \\nvdash G_T$. For the second part, for each standard $n$, $T$ can carry out a finite verification to prove $\\lnot \\mathrm{Prov}_T^{\\le n}(\\ulcorner H(n)\\urcorner)$ and hence $H(n)$. Furthermore, if there were a $T$-proof of $H(n)$ of length $\\le n$, then by representability $T$ would prove $\\mathrm{Prov}_T^{\\le n}(\\ulcorner H(n)\\urcorner)$, and by the fixed-point equivalence plus modus ponens, $T$ would also prove its negation, contradicting consistency. Thus no such short proof exists. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. The claim as stated conflates the bounded family with a single global fixed point. There is indeed a single-sentence fixed point $H$ for $x\\mapsto \\forall n\\,\\lnot \\mathrm{Prov}_T^{\\le n}(x)$, but that sentence is equivalent (in very weak arithmetic) to $\\lnot \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner H\\urcorner)$, hence behaves like the usual Gödel sentence and not as a bounded family. Moreover, tying $T \\vdash H$ to $\\omega$-consistency is misleading here; the standard unprovability of the Gödel sentence $G_T$ already follows from mere consistency (as shown above), while non-provability of $\\lnot G_T$ uses additional hypotheses (such as $\\omega$-consistency or $1$-consistency). As phrased, the option incorrectly characterizes the bounded construction and its dependence. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. The Hilbert–Bernays derivability conditions concern internal properties of $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$ used in Löb’s Theorem and the Second Incompleteness Theorem, but the existence of the fixed points $G_T$ and $H(n)$ comes from the Diagonal Lemma and representability of the relevant predicates, not from the derivability conditions. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. For each standard $n$, deciding $H(n)$ reduces to a finite, primitive recursive computation: check all $y$ with $\\ell(y)\\le n$ and verify $\\lnot \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,\\ulcorner H(n)\\urcorner)$. This verification is formalizable in Primitive Recursive Arithmetic (PRA), and in turn $T$ (extending PA and hence interpretable over PRA for such finitary reasoning) can prove $H(n)$. This illustrates that bounded, finitary fragments of consistency reasoning are attainable in line with finitistic aims, even though global unbounded versions (e.g., $\\lnot \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\cdot\\urcorner)$) elude proof in $T$ by Gödel’s limitations.
