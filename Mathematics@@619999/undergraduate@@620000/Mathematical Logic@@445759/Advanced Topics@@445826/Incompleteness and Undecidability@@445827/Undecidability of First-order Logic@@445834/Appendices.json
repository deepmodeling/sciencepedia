By building this logical blueprint, you will directly engage with the core mechanism of one of the most profound limitative results in modern logic.", "problem": "Consider a deterministic single-tape Turing Machine (TM) $\\mathcal{M} = (Q, \\Gamma, \\sqcup, \\delta, q_0, q_{\\mathrm{halt}})$, where $Q$ is a finite set of states with $|Q| = q$, $\\Gamma$ is a finite tape alphabet with $|\\Gamma| = s$ containing a designated blank symbol $\\sqcup$, $\\delta$ is the transition function, $q_0 \\in Q$ is the start state, and $q_{\\mathrm{halt}} \\in Q$ is the halting state. Work in First-Order Logic (FOL) with a single-sorted domain. Your goal is to design a first-order signature and explain how it encodes the computation of $\\mathcal{M}$ over discrete time steps in a way that is suitable for reducing the Halting Problem to FOL satisfiability, which underlies Church’s theorem (the undecidability of FOL validity).\n\nStarting only from core definitions of Turing Machines and First-Order Logic, construct a first-order signature $\\Sigma$ that includes:\n\n- A binary relation symbol $T(t, t')$ intended to be the successor relation on time steps (so $T(t, t')$ means $t'$ is the immediate next time after $t$).\n- A binary predicate symbol $H(t, c)$ indicating the head position on the tape (so $H(t, c)$ means that at time $t$ the head scans cell $c$).\n- For each tape symbol $a \\in \\Gamma$, a binary predicate symbol $S_a(t, c)$ indicating tape contents (so $S_a(t, c)$ means that at time $t$ cell $c$ carries symbol $a$).\n- For each machine state $p \\in Q$, a unary predicate symbol $Q_p(t)$ indicating the state (so $Q_p(t)$ means that at time $t$ the machine is in state $p$).\n\nTo adequately encode head motion and the structure of the tape, include the minimal additional nonlogical symbols necessary so that your axioms can express left and right moves of the head across adjacent cells and pin down an initial configuration. You must ensure that your design is scientifically sound and suffices to describe a discrete space-time computation. Assume the signature is otherwise as lean as possible, and avoid adding redundant symbols.\n\nGive a coherent description of how this signature supports axioms that enforce:\n\n- At each time $t$, exactly one state holds, exactly one head position holds, and each cell carries exactly one tape symbol.\n- The binary relation $T$ is a discrete successor on time points.\n- The chosen tape relation on cells is a discrete successor on cells enabling left and right movement.\n- The transition clauses faithfully reflect $\\delta$ so that from a configuration at time $t$ the tape contents, head position, and machine state at time $t'$ with $T(t, t')$ evolve exactly as specified by $\\delta$.\n\nExplain how such an encoding yields an effective mapping from $(\\mathcal{M}, w)$, with input word $w \\in \\Gamma^{*}$, to an FOL sentence whose satisfiability captures whether $\\mathcal{M}$ halts on $w$, thereby establishing a reduction from the Halting Problem to FOL satisfiability.\n\nFinally, compute, in closed form, the minimal total number of distinct nonlogical symbols in your signature $\\Sigma$ as a function of $q$ and $s$. Here “nonlogical symbols” include all constant symbols, function symbols, and predicate/relation symbols; equality is counted as logical and excluded. Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression in $q$ and $s$.", "solution": "The posed problem is a standard, canonical exercise in mathematical logic and computability theory. It asks for the construction of a first-order signature to encode the computation of a Turing Machine, an explanation of how this encoding works, and the tally of the symbols involved. This is the core of the proof of the undecidability of first-order logic (Church's Theorem) via a reduction from the Halting Problem. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and fully specified. It contains no flaws. We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to construct a first-order signature $\\Sigma$ and a set of axioms to describe the computation of a given deterministic single-tape Turing Machine, $\\mathcal{M} = (Q, \\Gamma, \\sqcup, \\delta, q_0, q_{\\mathrm{halt}})$, where $|Q| = q$ and $|\\Gamma| = s$. The encoding must be such that the question of whether $\\mathcal{M}$ halts on a given input word $w$ is equivalent to the satisfiability of a specific first-order sentence.\n\nFirst, we design the signature $\\Sigma$. The domain of our intended interpretation will be a set of elements representing discrete time steps and discrete tape cell positions. The problem mandates a specific set of nonlogical symbols, and we shall add the minimal number of symbols necessary to meet the requirements.\n\nThe signature $\\Sigma$ consists of the following nonlogical symbols:\n\n1.  **Predicate Symbols (Relations):**\n    *   $Q_p(t)$: A set of $q$ unary predicates, one for each state $p \\in Q$. $Q_p(t)$ is intended to be true if and only if the machine is in state $p$ at time $t$.\n    *   $S_a(t, c)$: A set of $s$ binary predicates, one for each tape symbol $a \\in \\Gamma$. $S_a(t, c)$ is intended to be true if and only if tape cell $c$ contains symbol $a$ at time $t$.\n    *   $H(t, c)$: A binary predicate. $H(t, c)$ is intended to be true if and only if the machine's head is scanning cell $c$ at time $t$.\n    *   $T(t, t')$: A binary predicate. $T(t, t')$ is intended to be true if and only if $t'$ is the time step immediately following time $t$.\n    *   $C(c, c')$: A binary predicate. This is a minimal addition required to express the spatial relationship between tape cells. $C(c, c')$ is intended to be true if and only if cell $c'$ is immediately to the right of cell $c$. This single relation is sufficient to describe left and right movements, as a move to the left of $c$ is a move to the cell $c'$ such that $C(c', c)$.\n\n2.  **Constant Symbols:**\n    *   $t_0$: A constant symbol representing the initial time step, time $0$.\n    *   $c_0$: A constant symbol representing the initial tape cell, cell $0$, where the head starts.\n    These are minimal additions required to \"pin down an initial configuration\" by providing a temporal and spatial origin.\n\n3.  **Function Symbols:**\n    *   None. A minimal signature can be constructed without function symbols, adhering to the relational style suggested by the problem's inclusion of $T(t, t')$.\n\nThe total count of these distinct nonlogical symbols in $\\Sigma$ is the sum of the counts of predicate symbols and constant symbols.\nNumber of predicate symbols = $q$ (for states) $+ s$ (for alphabet) $+ 1$ (for head) $+ 1$ (for time) $+ 1$ (for cells) $= q + s + 3$.\nNumber of constant symbols = $1$ (for initial time) $+ 1$ (for initial cell) $= 2$.\nThe total number of nonlogical symbols is $(q + s + 3) + 2 = q + s + 5$.\n\nNext, we describe how this signature supports a set of axioms that collectively form a sentence $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{M}, w}$. The sentence is a conjunction of formulas, grouped by purpose. A model of this sentence will correspond to a valid, halting computation history of $\\mathcal{M}$ on input $w$.\n\n1.  **Axioms of Structure:** These axioms constrain the interpretation of $T$ and $C$ to represent discrete succession, and the domain to represent a set of time points and tape cells.\n    *   **Time Structure:** Time begins at $t_0$ and proceeds linearly.\n        *   $\\forall t \\exists t' \\, T(t, t')$ (Every time has a successor).\n        *   $\\forall t, t'_1, t'_2 \\, (T(t, t'_1) \\land T(t, t'_2) \\implies t'_1 = t'_2)$ (Successor is unique).\n        *   $\\forall t \\, \\neg T(t, t_0)$ ($t_0$ is the first time step).\n    *   **Tape Structure:** The tape is a bi-infinite, discrete sequence of cells.\n        *   $\\forall c \\exists c' \\, C(c, c')$ (Every cell has a right neighbor).\n        *   $\\forall c, c'_1, c'_2 \\, (C(c, c'_1) \\land C(c, c'_2) \\implies c'_1 = c'_2)$ (Right neighbor is unique).\n        *   $\\forall c' \\exists c \\, C(c, c')$ (Every cell has a left neighbor).\n        *   $\\forall c', c_1, c_2 \\, (C(c_1, c') \\land C(c_2, c') \\implies c_1 = c_2)$ (Left neighbor is unique).\n\n2.  **Axioms of Uniqueness:** These ensure that at any given time, the machine configuration is well-defined.\n    *   **Unique State:** $\\forall t \\, \\left( (\\bigvee_{p \\in Q} Q_p(t)) \\land (\\bigwedge_{p_1 \\neq p_2 \\in Q} \\neg(Q_{p_1}(t) \\land Q_{p_2}(t))) \\right)$.\n    *   **Unique Head Position:** $\\forall t \\, ((\\exists c \\, H(t, c)) \\land (\\forall c_1, c_2 \\, (H(t, c_1) \\land H(t, c_2) \\implies c_1 = c_2)))$.\n    *   **Unique Symbol per Cell:** $\\forall t, c \\, \\left( (\\bigvee_{a \\in \\Gamma} S_a(t, c)) \\land (\\bigwedge_{a_1 \\neq a_2 \\in \\Gamma} \\neg(S_{a_1}(t, c) \\land S_{a_2}(t, c))) \\right)$.\n\n3.  **Axioms for the Initial Configuration:** Let the input word be $w = w_1 w_2 \\dots w_m \\in \\Gamma^*$.\n    *   **Initial State:** $Q_{q_0}(t_0)$.\n    *   **Initial Head Position:** $H(t_0, c_0)$.\n    *   **Initial Tape Contents:** We must assert the input word $w$ is written on the tape starting at $c_0$, and all other cells are blank ($\\sqcup$). This requires defining cell positions $c_1, \\dots, c_{m-1}$ relative to $c_0$.\n        *   $\\exists c_1, \\dots, c_{m-1} \\left(C(c_0, c_1) \\land C(c_1, c_2) \\land \\dots \\land C(c_{m-2}, c_{m-1}) \\land S_{w_1}(t_0, c_0) \\land \\dots \\land S_{w_m}(t_0, c_{m-1}) \\land \\forall c' ((\\bigwedge_{i=0}^{m-1} c' \\neq c_i) \\implies S_\\sqcup(t_0, c')) \\right)$.\n\n4.  **Axioms of Transition:** These axioms encode the transition function $\\delta$. For each rule in $\\delta$, we add a corresponding axiom.\n    *   **State and Tape Changes:** For each transition $\\delta(p, a) = (p', a', d)$ where $p \\in Q \\setminus \\{q_{\\mathrm{halt}}\\}$, $a \\in \\Gamma$, and $d$ is the head movement (L, R, or N):\n        *   If $d = \\text{Right}$: $\\forall t, t', c, c' \\Big[ \\big( T(t, t') \\land Q_p(t) \\land H(t, c) \\land S_a(t, c) \\land C(c, c') \\big) \\implies \\big( Q_{p'}(t') \\land S_{a'}(t', c) \\land H(t', c') \\big) \\Big]$.\n        *   If $d = \\text{Left}$: $\\forall t, t', c, c'' \\Big[ \\big( T(t, t') \\land Q_p(t) \\land H(t, c) \\land S_a(t, c) \\land C(c'', c) \\big) \\implies \\big( Q_{p'}(t') \\land S_{a'}(t', c) \\land H(t', c'') \\big) \\Big]$.\n        *   If $d = \\text{No-move}$: $\\forall t, t', c \\Big[ \\big( T(t, t') \\land Q_p(t) \\land H(t, c) \\land S_a(t, c) \\big) \\implies \\big( Q_{p'}(t') \\land S_{a'}(t', c) \\land H(t', c) \\big) \\Big]$.\n    *   **Frame Axiom (Inertia):** Cells not under the head do not change their symbol.\n        *   $\\forall t, t', c_{head}, c_{other}, a \\Big[ \\big( T(t, t') \\land H(t, c_{head}) \\land c_{head} \\neq c_{other} \\land S_a(t, c_{other}) \\big) \\implies S_a(t', c_{other}) \\Big]$.\n\nFinally, to address the Halting Problem, we need to ask whether the machine ever reaches the halting state $q_{\\mathrm{halt}}$. This is captured by the formula $\\exists t \\, Q_{q_{\\mathrm{halt}}}(t)$.\n\nThe reduction is as follows: given $(\\mathcal{M}, w)$, we construct a single FOL sentence $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{M}, w}$ by taking the conjunction of all the axioms described above (Structure, Uniqueness, Initial, Transition) and the halting condition:\n$\\Phi_{\\mathcal{M}, w} \\equiv (\\text{Axioms}_{\\text{Structure}}) \\land (\\text{Axioms}_{\\text{Uniqueness}}) \\land (\\text{Axioms}_{\\text{Initial}}) \\land (\\text{Axioms}_{\\text{Transition}}) \\land (\\exists t \\, Q_{q_{\\mathrm{halt}}}(t))$.\n\nThe construction of $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{M}, w}$ from $\\mathcal{M}$ and $w$ is an effective, algorithmic process. We establish the correctness of the reduction:\n*   **($\\Rightarrow$) If $\\mathcal{M}$ halts on $w$**, there exists a finite computation history, a sequence of configurations $C_0, C_1, \\dots, C_N$ where $C_0$ is the initial configuration for input $w$ and $C_N$ is a configuration in state $q_{\\mathrm{halt}}$. This history can be used to define a model for $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{M}, w}$. The domain can be, for instance, the set of integers. The interpretation of the predicates $Q_p, S_a, H$ is defined step-by-step according to the computation history. By construction, this interpretation satisfies all the axioms, including the final one, since at time $N$, the machine is in state $q_{\\mathrm{halt}}$. Thus, $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{M}, w}$ is satisfiable.\n*   **($\\Leftarrow$) If $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{M}, w}$ is satisfiable**, then there exists a model $\\mathfrak{A}$ that makes the sentence true. The axioms force this model to describe a valid computation history of $\\mathcal{M}$ starting on input $w$. The truth of the clause $\\exists t \\, Q_{q_{\\mathrm{halt}}}(t)$ in $\\mathfrak{A}$ implies that in this computation history, the machine reaches the state $q_{\\mathrm{halt}}$ at some time. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M}$ halts on $w$.\n\nThis establishes a many-one reduction from the Halting Problem to the satisfiability problem for first-order logic. Since the Halting Problem is undecidable, it follows that FOL satisfiability is also undecidable. As validity is inter-definable with satisfiability ($\\phi$ is valid iff $\\neg\\phi$ is unsatisfiable), the undecidability of satisfiability directly implies the undecidability of validity, which is Church's Theorem.\n\nThe final task is to compute the total number of nonlogical symbols in our minimal signature $\\Sigma$. As derived earlier, this is the sum of the $q+s+3$ predicate symbols and the $2$ constant symbols.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{q+s+5}\n$$", "id": "3059496"}, {"introduction": "A Turing machine's computation unfolds over discrete time steps on a potentially infinite tape.

Give your final answer as a single integer. No rounding is needed.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed question within mathematical logic and model theory, grounded in established formalisms. It is objective, self-contained, and directly related to the logical foundations used in proofs of undecidability. The task is to formulate a first-order theory and then analyze its models, which is a standard procedure in logic.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must provide a finite set of first-order axioms in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{<,S,0\\}$ that characterize a discrete linear order with a least element and no greatest element. Second, we must determine the number of non-isomorphic models of this theory having a specific finite cardinality.\n\n**Part 1: Axiomatization**\n\nWe formulate the required properties as a finite set of sentences in first-order logic.\n\n1.  **Strict Linear Order:** The relation $<$ must be irreflexive, transitive, and total.\n    *   Irreflexivity: $\\forall x \\, \\neg(x < x)$\n    *   Transitivity: $\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z \\, ((x < y \\land y < z) \\to x < z)$\n    *   Totality: $\\forall x \\forall y \\, (x < y \\lor y < x \\lor x = y)$\n\n2.  **Least Element:** The constant $0$ is the minimum element under the order $<$.\n    *   $\\forall x \\, (x=0 \\lor 0 < x)$\n\n3.  **Successor Relation:** The relation $S(x,y)$ holds if and only if $y$ is the immediate successor of $x$ with respect to $<$. This is defined as $y$ being the $<$-least element strictly greater than $x$.\n    *   $\\forall x \\forall y \\, (S(x,y) \\leftrightarrow (x < y \\land \\forall z \\, (x < z \\to (y < z \\lor y = z))))$\n    This axiom makes the interpretation of the symbol $S$ dependent on the interpretation of $<$.\n\n4.  **Existence of Successor:** Every element must have an $S$-successor. This ensures there is no maximal element in the order.\n    *   $\\forall x \\exists y \\, S(x,y)$\n\n5.  **Existence of Predecessor for Nonzero Elements:** Every element other than $0$ must be the $S$-successor of some other element. This ensures there are no \"gaps\" after the first element.\n    *   $\\forall x \\, (\\neg(x=0) \\to \\exists y \\, S(y,x))$\n\nThe collection of these seven sentences constitutes the required finite set of $\\mathcal{L}$-sentences. Let us call this theory $T$. The standard model of $T$ is the structure of natural numbers $(\\mathbb{N}, <, S, 0)$, where $<$ is the usual order, $S$ is the successor function $n \\mapsto n+1$, and $0$ is the number zero.\n\n**Part 2: Number of Non-Isomorphic Models of Cardinality $23$**\n\nWe are asked to find the number of non-isomorphic $\\mathcal{L}$-structures with a domain of cardinality $n=23$ that satisfy all the axioms of the theory $T$ defined in Part 1.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be an $\\mathcal{L}$-structure with a domain (universe) $M$ such that $|M|=23$. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $T$.\n\n1.  The axioms for $<$ enforce that $(M, <^{\\mathcal{M}})$ is a strictly and linearly ordered set. Since $M$ is finite with cardinality $23$, it must have both a least element and a greatest (maximal) element. Let the elements be ordered as $m_0 <^{\\mathcal{M}} m_1 <^{\\mathcal{M}} \\dots <^{\\mathcal{M}} m_{22}$.\n\n2.  The axiom for the constant $0$ states that $0^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is the least element. Therefore, we must have $0^{\\mathcal{M}} = m_0$.\n\n3.  One of the axioms in $T$ is the axiom of successor existence: $\\forall x \\exists y \\, S(x,y)$. This states that every element in the domain $M$ has an $S$-successor.\n\n4.  Let's consider the maximal element of the ordering on $M$, which is $m_{22}$. According to the successor existence axiom, this element $m_{22}$ must have an $S$-successor. Let this alleged successor be $y \\in M$. Thus, $S(m_{22}, y)$ must hold in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n5.  From the axiom defining $S$, the statement $S(m_{22}, y)$ is equivalent to:\n    $$m_{22} <^{\\mathcal{M}} y \\land \\forall z \\in M \\, (m_{22} <^{\\mathcal{M}} z \\to (y <^{\\mathcal{M}} z \\lor y = z))$$\n\n6.  The first part of this conjunction is $m_{22} <^{\\mathcal{M}} y$. However, $m_{22}$ is the maximal element of the finite linear order $(M, <^{\\mathcal{M}})$. By definition of a maximal element, there is no element $y$ in $M$ such that $m_{22} <^{\\mathcal{M}} y$.\n\n7.  Therefore, the predicate $m_{22} <^{\\mathcal{M}} y$ is false for every $y \\in M$. This implies that the conjunction defining $S(m_{22}, y)$ is false for every $y \\in M$.\n\n8.  This means that there is no element $y$ in $M$ for which $S(m_{22}, y)$ holds. In other words, the statement $\\neg \\exists y \\, S(m_{22}, y)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n9.  This directly contradicts the successor existence axiom $\\forall x \\exists y \\, S(x,y)$, which must be true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nThe assumption that there exists a model of $T$ of cardinality $23$ leads to a logical contradiction. The set of axioms $T$ is only satisfiable in infinite domains. Any finite linear order possesses a maximal element, which cannot have a successor in the sense required by the theory.\n\nTherefore, no $\\mathcal{L}$-structure of cardinality $n=23$ can satisfy all the specified axioms.

A structure $\\mathcal{M}$ for the given vocabulary $\\{c, s, Q\\}$ consists of a non-empty domain $D$ and an interpretation function $I$.\n\nLet the domain $D$ be the set of natural numbers, $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\nLet the interpretation function $I$ be defined as follows:\n$1$.

The interpretation of the unary function symbol $s$, denoted $s^{\\mathcal{M}}$, is the successor function on $\\mathbb{N}$. For any $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s^{\\mathcal{M}}(d) = d+1$.\n$3$. The interpretation of the unary predicate symbol $Q$, denoted $Q^{\\mathcal{M}}$, is the set of all natural numbers, $Q^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNow, we verify that the sentence $\\Phi \\equiv Q(c) \\wedge \\forall x (Q(x) \\rightarrow Q(s(x)))$ is true in this model, denoted $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi$. For a conjunction to be true, both conjuncts must be true.\n\nFirst conjunct: $Q(c)$.\nThe condition for $\\mathcal{M} \\models Q(c)$ to hold is that $c^{\\mathcal{M}}$ must be an element of the set $Q^{\\mathcal{M}}$. According to our interpretation, $c^{\\mathcal{M}} = 0$ and $Q^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\mathbb{N}$. The statement $0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is true. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M} \\models Q(c)$.\n\nSecond conjunct: $\\forall x (Q(x) \\rightarrow Q(s(x)))$.\nFor this universally quantified formula to be true in $\\mathcal{M}$, the subformula $Q(x) \\rightarrow Q(s(x))$ must be satisfied for every assignment of $x$ to an element of the domain $D = \\mathbb{N}$.

It directly forms the unit clause $\\{Q(c)\\}$.\n\nSecond conjunct: $\\forall x (Q(x) \\rightarrow Q(s(x)))$.\nWe apply the standard algorithm:\n$1$. **Eliminate implication:** The form $A \\rightarrow B$ is equivalent to $\\neg A \\vee B$. This yields $\\forall x (\\neg Q(x) \\vee Q(s(x)))$.\n$2$. **Prenex form:** The quantifier is already at the beginning.\n$3$. **Skolemization:** There are no existential quantifiers, so this step has no effect.\n$4$. **Drop universal quantifiers:** Variables are now implicitly universally quantified. This gives $\\neg Q(x) \\vee Q(s(x))$.\n$5$. **CNF conversion:** The formula is a disjunction of literals, which is already in Conjunctive Normal Form. This represents the clause $\\{\\neg Q(x), Q(s(x))\\}$.\n\nThe complete set of clauses is the conjunction of the clauses from each part:\n$C = \\{\\{Q(c)\\}, \\{\\neg Q(x), Q(s(x))\\}\\}$.\n\n**Part 3: Non-termination of Resolution**\nWe argue that a resolution refutation search on the clause set $C = \\{\\{Q(c)\\}, \\{\\neg Q(x), Q(s(x))\\}\\}$ does not terminate.\n\n$1$. **Satisfiability:** The conversion to clause form preserves satisfiability. Since we proved in Part $1$ that $\\Phi$ is satisfiable, its clause form $C$ must also be satisfiable.\n$2$. **Soundness of Resolution:** The resolution inference rule is sound. This means that if a set of clauses $C$ is satisfiable, it is impossible to derive the empty clause, $\\Box$, from $C$. Deriving $\\Box$ is equivalent to proving unsatisfiability.\n$3$. **Conclusion from Soundness:** From points $1$ and $2$, since $C$ is satisfiable, the empty clause $\\Box$ is not derivable from $C$. A resolution refutation search terminates successfully if and only if it derives $\\Box$. Thus, the search cannot terminate with a successful refutation.\n$4$. **Fairness and Infinite Generation:** We must also show that the search does not terminate by exhausting all possible resolution steps. A fair strategy guarantees that any resolvable pair of clauses will eventually be considered. Let us examine the derivations from $C$.\nLet $C_1 = \\{Q(c)\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{\\neg Q(x), Q(s(x))\\}$.\nResolving $C_1$ with $C_2$ (unifying $Q(c)$ with $Q(x)$) yields a new clause, $C_3 = \\{Q(s(c))\\}$.\nA fair strategy must now consider resolving $C_3$ with $C_2$ (unifying $Q(s(c))$ with $Q(x)$), which yields a new clause, $C_4 = \\{Q(s(s(c)))\\}$.\nThis process continues indefinitely. For any derived clause of the form $\\{Q(s^k(c))\\}$ where $k \\ge 0$, resolution with $C_2$ produces a new, distinct clause $\\{Q(s^{k+1}(c))\\}$.\nSince new clauses can be generated at every stage, the set of derivable clauses is infinite. A fair strategy will never exhaust the set of possible resolutions.\n\nBecause the empty clause is underivable (by soundness) and new clauses are infinitely generated, a fair resolution search does not terminate. This illustrates a case where the semi-decision procedure for unsatisfiability (which resolution provides) correctly fails to halt for a satisfiable formula, a behavior consistent with the undecidability of first-order logic (Church's theorem).\n\n**Part 4: Closed-Form Expression for $N(n)$**\n$N(n)$ is the number of distinct derivable unit clauses of the form $\\{Q(t)\\}$ where $\\operatorname{depth}(t) \\le n$. The derivation process starts with the clause set $C$ and repeatedly resolves the clause $\\{\\neg Q(x), Q(s(x))\\}$ with available unit clauses.\n\nThe initial unit clause is $\\{Q(c)\\}$. The term is $t_0 = c$. By definition, $\\operatorname{depth}(t_0) = 0$.\nThe first resolution step uses $\\{Q(c)\\}$ to derive $\\{Q(s(c))\\}$. The term is $t_1 = s(c)$. Its depth is $\\operatorname{depth}(t_1) = 1 + \\operatorname{depth}(c) = 1+0 = 1$.\nThe next step uses $\\{Q(s(c))\\}$ to derive $\\{Q(s(s(c)))\\}$. The term is $t_2 = s(s(c))$. Its depth is $\\operatorname{depth}(t_2) = 1 + \\operatorname{depth}(s(c)) = 1+1 = 2$.\n\nBy induction, the process generates a sequence of unit clauses $\\{Q(s^k(c))\\}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The term in the $k$-th such clause (starting from $k=0$) is $t_k = s^k(c)$.\nThe depth of term $t_k$ is calculated from the recursive definition $\\operatorname{depth}(s(t)) = 1 + \\operatorname{depth}(t)$:\n$\\operatorname{depth}(t_k) = \\operatorname{depth}(s^k(c)) = k$.\n\nThe set of all distinct derivable unit clauses is $\\{\\{Q(s^k(c))\\} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}, k \\ge 0\\}$.\nWe need to count how many of these clauses have a term $t$ such that $\\operatorname{depth}(t) \\le n$.\nSubstituting $t = s^k(c)$ and $\\operatorname{depth}(t) = k$, the condition becomes $k \\le n$.\nSince $k$ must be a non-negative integer, we are counting the number of integers in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe number of elements in this set is $(n - 0) + 1 = n+1$.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression for $N(n)$ is $n+1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n+1}\n$$", "id": "3059505"}]}
