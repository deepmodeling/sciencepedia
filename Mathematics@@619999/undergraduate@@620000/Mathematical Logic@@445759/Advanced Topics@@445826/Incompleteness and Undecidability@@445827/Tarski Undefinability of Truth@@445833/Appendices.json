The criteria for correctness are clear and lead to a unique solution.\n-   **Objective (Critical):** Yes. The problem is stated in formal language and relies on objective definitions from mathematical logic. There is no ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\nThe problem statement does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a well-formed conceptual question in formal logic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n-   **Verdict:** The problem is **valid**.\n-   **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is the precise definition of a T-sentence, which embodies Alfred Tarski's \"Convention T\" for a theory of truth. According to the problem statement, for a given $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{A}}$-sentence $\\varphi$, the corresponding T-sentence is the metalinguistic biconditional $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$.\n\nThe predicate $T(x)$ is defined to mean that the sentence with Gödel code $x$ is true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$. This is expressed as $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\psi$, where $\\ulcorner \\psi \\urcorner = x$. Thus, the T-sentence asserts that \"$(\\mathbb{N} \\models \\varphi) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$\". This biconditional should hold for any adequate definition of truth.\n\nTo be a \"correct example\" of a T-sentence, a given biconditional must satisfy two structural requirements derived from the definition:\n1.  The object inside the Gödel code notation, $\\varphi$ in $\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner$, must be a **sentence** of the language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{A}}$. A sentence is a well-formed formula with no free variables. The predicate $T$ is defined only over the Gödel codes of sentences.\n2.  The expression must be a biconditional of the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\psi$, where the sentence $\\psi$ on the right-hand side is syntactically identical to the sentence $\\varphi$ on the left-hand side.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these two criteria.\n\nA. $T(\\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow 0=0$\nLet $\\varphi$ be the formula $0=0$.\n1.  Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The formula $0=0$ is constructed from the constant symbol $0$ and the equality relation. It contains no variables, and thus no free variables. Therefore, $0=0$ is a sentence of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the sentence on the right is identical to the sentence inside the Gödel code on the left.\nSemantically, the sentence $0=0$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$, so $T(\\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner)$ is a true assertion. The right-hand side, $0=0$, is also a true statement. The biconditional is $True \\leftrightarrow True$, which is true. The option is a correct example.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. $T(\\ulcorner \\forall x\\,(x+0=x)\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow \\forall x\\,(x+0=x)$\nLet $\\varphi$ be the formula $\\forall x\\,(x+0=x)$.\n1.  Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The formula $x+0=x$ contains the variable $x$. However, the universal quantifier $\\forall x$ binds this variable. As there are no other variables, the formula has no free variables and is a sentence.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the sentence on the right is identical to the sentence inside the Gödel code on the left.\nSemantically, the sentence $\\forall x\\,(x+0=x)$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ (it is the axiom for the identity element of addition). Thus, $T(\\ulcorner \\forall x\\,(x+0=x)\\urcorner)$ is true, and the RHS is also a true arithmetical statement. The biconditional holds. The option is a correct example.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. $T(\\ulcorner \\exists x\\,(x=x+1)\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow \\exists x\\,(x=x+1)$\nLet $\\varphi$ be the formula $\\exists x\\,(x=x+1)$. Here, $1$ is an abbreviation for $S(0)$. So the formula is $\\exists x\\,(x=x+S(0))$.\n1.  Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The formula $x=x+1$ has a free variable $x$. The existential quantifier $\\exists x$ binds this variable. Thus, the formula is a sentence.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the structure is correct.\nConvention T must hold for all sentences, regardless of their truth value. Semantically, the sentence $\\exists x\\,(x=x+1)$ is false in $\\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, the assertion $T(\\ulcorner \\exists x\\,(x=x+1)\\urcorner)$ is false. The assertion on the right-hand side, $\\exists x\\,(x=x+1)$, is also false. The biconditional is $False \\leftrightarrow False$, which is true. The option is a correct example, illustrating that the T-schema applies to false sentences as well.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. $T(\\ulcorner x+0=x\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow x+0=x$\nLet $\\psi$ be the formula $x+0=x$.\n1.  Is $\\psi$ a sentence? No. The formula $x+0=x$ contains a **free variable** $x$. It is not a sentence.\nThe truth predicate $T$ is defined for sentences, not for formulas with free variables. The truth of $\\psi$ is not determined until a value from the domain is assigned to $x$. Therefore, the expression $T(\\ulcorner x+0=x\\urcorner)$ is malformed according to the problem's definition of $T$. This option fails the first criterion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $T(\\ulcorner \\forall x\\exists y\\,(y=x+1)\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow \\exists y\\forall x\\,(y=x+1)$\nLet $\\varphi \\equiv \\forall x\\exists y\\,(y=x+1)$ and $\\psi \\equiv \\exists y\\forall x\\,(y=x+1)$.\n1.  The formula $\\varphi$ is a sentence, as all its variables are bound. So the left-hand side $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$ is well-formed.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? No. The expression is of the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\psi$, but $\\varphi$ is not syntactically identical to $\\psi$. The order of quantifiers has been swapped, resulting in a logically distinct sentence. This is not a T-sentence for $\\varphi$.\nSemantically, $\\varphi$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ (for every number, there is a successor), so $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$ is true. However, $\\psi$ is false in $\\mathbb{N}$ (there is no number that is the successor of all numbers). The biconditional is $True \\leftrightarrow False$, which is false. This demonstrates precisely why the sentence on the right must be identical to the one on the left.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. $T(\\ulcorner \\neg\\exists x\\,(x<0)\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow \\neg\\exists x\\,(x<0)$\nLet $\\varphi$ be the formula $\\neg\\exists x\\,(x<0)$.\n1.  Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The subformula $x<0$ has a free variable $x$. The quantifier $\\exists x$ binds it, forming the sentence $\\exists x\\,(x<0)$. The negation of a sentence is a sentence. So, $\\varphi$ is a sentence.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the structure is correct.\nSemantically, the sentence $\\neg\\exists x\\,(x<0)$ states that there is no natural number less than $0$. This is true in $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. Thus, $T(\\ulcorner \\neg\\exists x\\,(x<0)\\urcorner)$ is true, and the RHS is a true statement. The biconditional holds. The option is a correct example.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCF}$$", "id": "3054361"}, {"introduction": "The key to Tarski's proof, borrowing a technique from Gödel, is the arithmetization of syntax—the radical idea that statements *about* formulas can be encoded as statements *within* the language of arithmetic itself.

The tasks are: to compute a specific Gödel code, to evaluate the truth of a sentence, and to demonstrate Tarski's undefinability of truth. I will address each task in sequence.\n\nFirst, we compute the Gödel code of the sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$. The problem specifies a Gödel coding scheme based on prime factorization. The sentence, when written as a linear string of symbols, is $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\sigma_4\\sigma_5\\sigma_6\\sigma_7\\sigma_8\\sigma_9$, which corresponds to the sequence of symbols:\n$S, (, S, (, 0, ), ), =, \\mathtt{2}$\n\nWe are given the symbol-code map $c$:\n$c(\\mathtt{(})=1$\n$c(\\mathtt{)})=2$\n$c(\\mathtt{S})=3$\n$c(\\mathtt{0})=4$\n$c(\\mathtt{=})=5$\n$c(\\mathtt{2})=6$\n\nApplying this map to our sequence of symbols $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\cdots\\sigma_9$:\n$c(\\sigma_1) = c(S) = 3$\n$c(\\sigma_2) = c(() = 1$\n$c(\\sigma_3) = c(S) = 3$\n$c(\\sigma_4) = c(() = 1$\n$c(\\sigma_5) = c(0) = 4$\n$c(\\sigma_6) = c()) = 2$\n$c(\\sigma_7) = c()) = 2$\n$c(\\sigma_8) = c(=) = 5$\n$c(\\sigma_9) = c(\\mathtt{2}) = 6$\n\nThe Gödel code is defined as $\\ulcorner \\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\cdots\\sigma_n \\urcorner = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i^{\\,c(\\sigma_i)}$, where $p_i$ is the $i$-th prime number. For our $9$-symbol sentence, we need the first $9$ primes:\n$p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, p_4=7, p_5=11, p_6=13, p_7=17, p_8=19, p_9=23$.\n\nWe construct the product:\n$\\ulcorner S(S(0))=\\mathtt{2} \\urcorner = p_1^{c(\\sigma_1)} \\times p_2^{c(\\sigma_2)} \\times p_3^{c(\\sigma_3)} \\times p_4^{c(\\sigma_4)} \\times p_5^{c(\\sigma_5)} \\times p_6^{c(\\sigma_6)} \\times p_7^{c(\\sigma_7)} \\times p_8^{c(\\sigma_8)} \\times p_9^{c(\\sigma_9)}$\nSubstituting the values for the primes and the codes, we obtain:\n$\\ulcorner S(S(0))=\\mathtt{2} \\urcorner = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^4 \\cdot 13^2 \\cdot 17^2 \\cdot 19^5 \\cdot 23^6$.\nThis is the exact prime-power product for the Gödel code as requested.\n\nSecond, we determine the truth value of the sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ in the standard model of Peano Arithmetic, which is the structure of the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe interpretation of the symbols in $\\mathbb{N}$ is as follows:\n- The symbol $0$ is interpreted as the number $0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n- The function symbol $S$ is interpreted as the successor function, $S(n) = n+1$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n- The symbol $=$ is interpreted as the relation of identity on $\\mathbb{N}$.\n- The problem states that the symbol $\\mathtt{2}$ is an abbreviation for the numeral $S(S(0))$. A numeral is a term in the language that denotes a number.\n\nLet us evaluate the term $S(S(0))$ in $\\mathbb{N}$:\n- The interpretation of $S(0)$ is $S(0) = 0+1 = 1$.\n- The interpretation of $S(S(0))$ is $S(1) = 1+1 = 2$.\nSo, the left-hand side of the equation refers to the number $2$.\n\nThe right-hand side is the symbol $\\mathtt{2}$, which is explicitly stated to be an abbreviation for the term $S(S(0))$. Therefore, its intended interpretation is the same as that of $S(S(0))$, which is the number $2$.\n\nThe sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ thus asserts that the number denoted by $S(S(0))$ is identical to the number denoted by $\\mathtt{2}$. In the standard model, this statement is $2=2$. This is a true statement.\nTherefore, the sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThird, we address Tarski's undefinability theorem. We must show that no formula $T(x)$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ can define the set of true sentences of arithmetic. The proof is by contradiction, using the diagonal lemma.\n\n1.  Assume for contradiction that such a formula $T(x)$ exists. This formula has one free variable, $x$. The property of $T(x)$ is that for any sentence $\\varphi$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$, $T(x)$ is true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$ when $x$ is assigned the Gödel number of $\\varphi$, if and only if $\\varphi$ itself is true in $\\mathbb{N}$. Formally, using $\\models$ to denote truth in a model:\n    For every sentence $\\varphi$ of $\\mathcal{L}$, $\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\iff \\mathbb{N} \\models \\varphi$.\n    Here, $\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner$ represents the numeral corresponding to the Gödel number of $\\varphi$.\n\n2.  Consider the formula with one free variable $x$, given by $\\neg T(x)$. This is a valid formula in the language of PA.\n\n3.  We invoke the diagonal lemma. The lemma states that for any formula $\\theta(x)$ with one free variable, there exists a sentence $G$ such that the equivalence $G \\leftrightarrow \\theta(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ is provable in Peano Arithmetic (PA).\n    Let's apply the lemma to our formula $\\theta(x) = \\neg T(x)$. The lemma guarantees the existence of a sentence $G$ (often called the \"liar sentence\") such that:\n    $PA \\vdash G \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$\n\n4.  Since this equivalence is provable in PA, and since the axioms of PA are true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$, the equivalence must also be true in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n    $\\mathbb{N} \\models G \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$\n    This means that the sentence $G$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ if and only if the sentence $\\neg T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$. By the definition of negation, this is equivalent to:\n    $(\\mathbb{N} \\models G)$ is true $\\iff$ $(\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner))$ is false.\n\n5.  Now we use the defining property of our hypothetical truth predicate $T(x)$ from step 1, applied to the specific sentence $G$:\n    $(\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner))$ is true $\\iff$ $(\\mathbb{N} \\models G)$ is true.\n\n6.  We have derived two necessary conditions. Let $P$ be the proposition \"$\\mathbb{N} \\models G$\" (i.e., \"$G$ is true\"). Let $Q$ be the proposition \"$\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$\" (i.e., \"$T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ is true\").\n    From step 4 (the diagonal lemma): $P \\iff \\neg Q$.\n    From step 5 (the property of $T(x)$): $P \\iff Q$.\n    Combining these, we get $Q \\iff \\neg Q$.\n\n7.  This is a formal contradiction. A proposition cannot be equivalent to its own negation. If $Q$ were true, it must be false. If $Q$ were false, it must be true. This is impossible in classical logic.\n\n8.  The contradiction arises from the initial assumption that a truth-defining formula $T(x)$ exists within the language of PA. Therefore, this assumption must be false. We conclude that there is no formula in $\\mathcal{L}$ that defines the set of Gödel numbers of true sentences of arithmetic. This is Tarski's undefinability of truth theorem.\n\nThe truth of a sentence like $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ is evaluable because we can step \"outside\" the formal system of PA and use a meta-theory (like set theory) where the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$ is an object we can inspect. We interpret the symbols and perform calculations in this meta-theory. However, Tarski's theorem shows that the formal system of PA itself is not strong enough to formalize this \"outside\" notion of truth for all of its own sentences. Any attempt to create an internal truth predicate $T(x)$ will fail, as demonstrated by the liar paradox embodied in the sentence $G$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^4 \\cdot 13^2 \\cdot 17^2 \\cdot 19^5 \\cdot 23^6}$$", "id": "3054377"}, {"introduction": "Tarski's Undefinability Theorem is a profound negative result, demonstrating a fundamental limitation of formal languages.

It is a valid problem in mathematical logic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe task is to correctly contrast a definable set with the non-definability of the set of true arithmetic sentences, $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$.\n\n**Part 1: Definability of the set of perfect squares**\nThe set of perfect squares is the set $S_q = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\exists k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ such that } n = k^2 \\}$. To show this set is $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-definable, we must find an $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-formula $\\varphi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ that is true precisely for the members of $S_q$.\n\nThe statement \"$n$ is a perfect square\" can be expressed as \"there exists a number $k$ such that $n = k \\cdot k$\". This translates directly into the language of first-order arithmetic. Let's construct the formula. The property is expressed using a variable $x$ for the number being tested:\n$$ \\varphi(x) \\equiv \\exists y (x = y \\cdot y) $$\nHere, $x$ is the single free variable, $y$ is a bound variable, $=$ is the equality predicate, and $\\cdot$ is a binary function symbol in $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$. This is a valid $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-formula.\n\nFor any natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the model $\\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $\\varphi(\\overline{n})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\exists y (\\overline{n} = y \\cdot y)$. This is true if and only if there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = k \\cdot k$, which is the definition of $n$ being a perfect square. Thus, the set of perfect squares is $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-definable.\n\n**Part 2: Non-definability of $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ (Tarski's Undefinability Theorem)**\nWe proceed by contradiction, using the provided Diagonal Lemma.\n\n1.  **Assumption for Contradiction**: Assume that the set $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ is $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-definable.\n2.  **Implication of Assumption**: By definition, this means there exists an $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-formula, let's call it $T(x)$, with one free variable $x$, such that for any $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-sentence $\\sigma$:\n    $$ \\mathbb{N} \\models \\sigma \\quad \\iff \\quad \\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner \\sigma \\urcorner) $$\n    where $\\ulcorner \\sigma \\urcorner$ is the Gödel number of $\\sigma$. The formula $T(x)$ acts as a \"truth predicate\".\n3.  **Application of the Diagonal Lemma**: Consider the formula $\\theta(x) \\equiv \\neg T(x)$. This is a valid $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-formula with one free variable, $x$. By the Diagonal Lemma, there exists a sentence $L$ (for \"Liar sentence\") such that:\n    $$ \\mathbb{N} \\models L \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner) $$\n    This sentence $L$ effectively says \"I am not true\", because $T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$ is supposed to mean \"$L$ is true\".\n4.  **Derivation of Contradiction**: We now evaluate the truth value of the sentence $L$ in the model $\\mathbb{N}$.\n    -   **Case I**: Suppose $L$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$. That is, $\\mathbb{N} \\models L$.\n        -   By our assumption that $T(x)$ defines truth, if $\\mathbb{N} \\models L$, then $\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$.\n        -   However, by the property of $L$ from the Diagonal Lemma, if $\\mathbb{N} \\models L$, then the biconditional $L \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$ implies $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$.\n        -   This is a contradiction: the model $\\mathbb{N}$ cannot satisfy both $T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$ and its negation $\\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$.\n    -   **Case II**: Suppose $L$ is false in $\\mathbb{N}$. That is, $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\neg L$.\n        -   By our assumption that $T(x)$ defines truth, if $L$ is false, then $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$.\n        -   By the property of $L$ from the Diagonal Lemma, the biconditional $L \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$ holds. Since we have $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$, the biconditional implies $\\mathbb{N} \\models L$.\n        -   This is also a contradiction: we assumed $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\neg L$ and derived $\\mathbb{N} \\models L$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since both cases lead to a contradiction, the initial assumption must be false. Therefore, the set $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ is not $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-definable.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The set of perfect squares is definable in $\\mathbb{N}$ by a formula of the form $\\exists y\\,(x = y \\cdot y)$, and by the same method one can define $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ via a single first-order formula that internally expresses satisfaction for all sentences; the Diagonal Lemma poses no obstacle because it applies only to sentences, not to predicates.**\n-   The first clause regarding the definability of perfect squares is correct.\n-   The second clause claims $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ is definable. This is false, as proven by Tarski's theorem.\n-   The reasoning about the Diagonal Lemma is incorrect. The lemma is applied to a formula with one free variable (which can be called a predicate), like $\\theta(x)$, to obtain a sentence. The very purpose of this application is to construct a self-referential sentence that leads to contradiction. The claim that it \"applies only to sentences\" is a misunderstanding of its statement and use.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The set of perfect squares is definable in $\\mathbb{N}$ (for example, by some $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-formula asserting that $x$ is a product $y \\cdot y$), but if $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ were definable by an $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-formula $T(x)$, then by the Diagonal Lemma there would be a sentence $L$ with $\\mathbb{N} \\models L \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner L \\urcorner)$, contradicting that $T$ defines truth. Hence $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ is not definable.**\n-   The first part correctly asserts that the set of perfect squares is definable and suggests the correct form of the formula.\n-   The second part provides a concise and accurate summary of the proof of Tarski's Undefinability Theorem. It correctly states the hypothetical truth predicate $T(x)$, the application of the Diagonal Lemma to $\\neg T(x)$ to get the liar sentence $L$, and the resulting contradiction. The conclusion is correct.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Neither the set of perfect squares nor $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ is definable in first-order arithmetic, because multiplication is not expressible in $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$ and the Diagonal Lemma requires second-order quantification.**\n-   This option contains multiple falsehoods.\n-   The set of perfect squares is definable, as demonstrated above.\n-   The language $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$ is explicitly defined to contain the function symbol `·` for multiplication, so multiplication is directly expressible.\n-   The Diagonal Lemma is a theorem of first-order arithmetic and does not require second-order logic or quantification.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The set of perfect squares is not definable in first-order arithmetic (it needs second-order quantifiers), whereas $\\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ is definable by a first-order formula stating that a sentence has a proof in Peano Arithmetic (PA), so definability of truth reduces to provability.**\n-   The first clause is false; the set of perfect squares is definable in first-order arithmetic.\n-   The second clause is also false and reflects a common confusion. The set of Gödel numbers of sentences provable in PA, let's denote it $\\mathrm{Provable}_{\\mathrm{PA}}$, is indeed definable in $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$. However, by Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem, there are sentences that are true in $\\mathbb{N}$ but not provable in PA. Thus, $\\mathrm{Provable}_{\\mathrm{PA}} \\neq \\mathrm{True}_{\\mathbb{N}}$. Defining provability does not define truth. Tarski's theorem shows that truth in $\\mathbb{N}$ is undefinable, while Gödel showed that provability in a system like PA is definable.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3054397"}]}
