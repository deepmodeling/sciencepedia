Write your final answer as the resulting numeral $\\bar{n}$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation of how the given axiomatic definitions for addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\\cdot$) in Peano Arithmetic (PA) characterize these operations as functions defined by primitive recursion, and for a formal derivation of the value of $\\bar{2} + \\bar{3}$.\n\nFirst, let's address the characterization by primitive recursion. The scheme of definition by primitive recursion for a function $f$ of $k+1$ arguments is defined from a function $g$ of $k$ arguments and a function $h$ of $k+2$ arguments as follows:\n$$f(x_1, \\dots, x_k, 0) = g(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$$\n$$f(x_1, \\dots, x_k, S(y)) = h(x_1, \\dots, x_k, y, f(x_1, \\dots, x_k, y))$$\nThis scheme defines the value of the function $f$ for the argument $0$ and defines its value for $S(y)$ in terms of its value for $y$. Since every natural number is either $0$ or a successor of another natural number, this recursively defines the function for all natural numbers in its last argument.\n\nLet's examine the provided defining equations for addition and multiplication in this context. The variables $x$ and $y$ are understood to range over the domain of the structure, which for PA are the natural numbers. The numerals $\\bar{n}$ are the formal terms in the language of PA that represent the natural numbers.\n\nFor addition, let's denote the operation as a function $f_+(x, y) = x+y$. The defining equations are:\n$1.$ $\\forall x\\ (x + 0 = x)$\n$2.$ $\\forall x\\,\\forall y\\ (x + S(y) = S(x + y))$\n\nThis fits the primitive recursion scheme with $k=1$ (one parameter $x$).\nThe base case is for the second argument being $0$:\n$x+0 = x$. This matches the form $f_+(x, 0) = g(x)$, where $g(x) = x$ is the identity function.\nThe recursive step is for the second argument being a successor, $S(y)$:\n$x+S(y) = S(x+y)$. This matches the form $f_+(x, S(y)) = h(x, y, f_+(x, y))$. Here, $f_+(x, y)$ is $x+y$, and the right-hand side is $S(x+y)$. So, the function $h$ is $h(x, y, z) = S(z)$, where $z = f_+(x, y)$. The function $h$ is simply the successor function applied to the result of the previous step of the recursion. Since the identity function and the successor function are the basic functions from which all primitive recursive functions are built, addition is indeed defined by primitive recursion.\n\nFor multiplication, let's denote the operation as a function $f_\\cdot(x, y) = x \\cdot y$. The defining equations are:\n$1.$ $\\forall x\\ (x \\cdot 0 = 0)$\n$2.$ $\\forall x\\,\\forall y\\ (x \\cdot S(y) = (x \\cdot y) + x)$\n\nThis also fits the primitive recursion scheme with $k=1$.\nThe base case is for the second argument being $0$:\n$x \\cdot 0 = 0$. This matches the form $f_\\cdot(x, 0) = g(x)$, where $g(x) = 0$ is the constant zero function.\nThe recursive step is for the second argument being a successor, $S(y)$:\n$x \\cdot S(y) = (x \\cdot y) + x$. This matches the form $f_\\cdot(x, S(y)) = h(x, y, f_\\cdot(x, y))$. Here, $f_\\cdot(x, y)$ is $x \\cdot y$, and the right-hand side is $(x \\cdot y) + x$. So, the function $h$ is $h(x, y, z) = z+x$, where $z = f_\\cdot(x, y)$. The function $h$ uses the addition operation, which we have already shown to be primitive recursive. This is a valid construction, and so multiplication is also defined by primitive recursion.\n\nThis recursive structure ensures that for any two numerals, say $\\bar{m}$ and $\\bar{n}$, the terms $\\bar{m} + \\bar{n}$ and $\\bar{m} \\cdot \\bar{n}$ are uniquely determined. The evaluation proceeds by repeatedly applying the recursive rule, which reduces the complexity of the numeral in the second argument. Since any numeral $\\bar{n}$ for $n > 0$ can be written as $S(S(\\dots S(0)\\dots))$ ($n$ times), the recursion is guaranteed to terminate after $n$ steps by reaching the base case with the second argument being $\\bar{0}$.\n\nNow, we will derive the closed form of the term $\\bar{2} + \\bar{3}$ using only the definitions of numerals and the defining equations for addition.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions for the numerals involved:\n$\\bar{0} := 0$\n$\\bar{1} := S(\\bar{0})$\n$\\bar{2} := S(\\bar{1}) = S(S(\\bar{0}))$\n$\\bar{3} := S(\\bar{2}) = S(S(S(\\bar{0})))$\n$\\bar{4} := S(\\bar{3})$\n$\\bar{5} := S(\\bar{4})$\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows:\n$$ \\bar{2} + \\bar{3} = \\bar{2} + S(\\bar{2}) \\quad (\\text{by definition of } \\bar{3}) $$\nWe apply the second axiom of addition, $\\forall x\\,\\forall y\\ (x + S(y) = S(x + y))$, with $x = \\bar{2}$ and $y = \\bar{2}$:\n$$ \\bar{2} + S(\\bar{2}) = S(\\bar{2} + \\bar{2}) $$\nNow we must evaluate the inner term $\\bar{2} + \\bar{2}$:\n$$ \\bar{2} + \\bar{2} = \\bar{2} + S(\\bar{1}) \\quad (\\text{by definition of } \\bar{2}) $$\nAgain, applying the second axiom of addition with $x = \\bar{2}$ and $y = \\bar{1}$:\n$$ \\bar{2} + S(\\bar{1}) = S(\\bar{2} + \\bar{1}) $$\nNext, we evaluate $\\bar{2} + \\bar{1}$:\n$$ \\bar{2} + \\bar{1} = \\bar{2} + S(\\bar{0}) \\quad (\\text{by definition of } \\bar{1}) $$\nApplying the second axiom of addition with $x = \\bar{2}$ and $y = \\bar{0}$:\n$$ \\bar{2} + S(\\bar{0}) = S(\\bar{2} + \\bar{0}) $$\nFinally, we evaluate $\\bar{2} + \\bar{0}$. For this, we use the first axiom of addition, $\\forall x\\ (x+0=x)$, with $x = \\bar{2}$:\n$$ \\bar{2} + \\bar{0} = \\bar{2} $$\nNow we substitute our results back, creating a chain of equalities:\n$$ \\bar{2} + \\bar{3} = S(\\bar{2} + \\bar{2}) = S(S(\\bar{2} + \\bar{1})) = S(S(S(\\bar{2} + \\bar{0}))) = S(S(S(\\bar{2}))) $$\nThe problem requires simplifying this to a single numeral of the form $\\bar{n}$. We use the definition of numerals, $\\overline{k+1} = S(\\bar{k})$, to simplify the expression:\n$$ S(\\bar{2}) = \\bar{3} $$\n$$ S(S(\\bar{2})) = S(\\bar{3}) = \\bar{4} $$\n$$ S(S(S(\\bar{2}))) = S(\\bar{4}) = \\bar{5} $$\nThus, the result of the derivation is the numeral $\\bar{5}$.\n$$ \\bar{2} + \\bar{3} = \\bar{5} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\bar{5}}$$", "id": "3039646"}, {"introduction": "Gentzen's revolutionary proof required a new kind of \"measuring stick\" to track the complexity of logical derivationsâ€”one that could ensure a reduction process terminates.

Computation and Simplification of Expressions**\n\nWe now compute the given expressions using only these definitions and the specified properties of von Neumann ordinals.\n\n*Computation of $\\omega + 1$*\nThis expression involves the addition of $\\omega$ and the successor ordinal $1$. Since $1$ is defined as the successor of $0$, i.e., $1 = 0+1$, we can apply the successor clause for addition with $\\alpha = \\omega$ and using $1=\\gamma+1$ with $\\gamma=0$:\n$$ \\omega + 1 = \\omega + (0 + 1) = (\\omega + 0) + 1 $$\nBy the base clause for addition, $\\alpha + 0 = \\alpha$, so $\\omega + 0 = \\omega$. Substituting this back gives:\n$$ (\\omega + 0) + 1 = \\omega + 1 $$\nThe expression $\\omega + 1$ is already in its standard, simplified form. It denotes the immediate successor of the ordinal $\\omega$.\n\n*Computation of $1 + \\omega$*\nThis expression involves the limit ordinal $\\omega$ as the second argument. We use the limit clause for addition with $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta=\\omega$:\n$$ 1 + \\omega = \\sup\\{1 + \\delta \\mid \\delta  \\omega\\} $$\nThe ordinals $\\delta$ such that $\\delta  \\omega$ are the finite ordinals $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The set in the supremum is thus $\\{1+0, 1+1, 1+2, \\dots, 1+n, \\dots\\}$. For finite ordinals, ordinal addition agrees with standard arithmetic, so this set is $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, n+1, \\dots\\}$.\nThe supremum of this set of ordinals is the smallest ordinal that is greater than or equal to every element in the set. Using the property that the supremum is the union:\n$$ \\sup\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\} = \\bigcup\\{\\{0\\}, \\{0,1\\}, \\{0,1,2\\}, \\dots\\} $$\nThe union of these sets is $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$, which is the definition of $\\omega$.\nTherefore, the simplified result is:\n$$ 1 + \\omega = \\omega $$\n\n*Computation of $\\omega \\cdot 2$*\nThis expression involves multiplication with the successor ordinal $2$. We write $2$ as $1+1$ and apply the successor clause for multiplication with $\\alpha = \\omega$ and using $2=\\gamma+1$ with $\\gamma=1$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega \\cdot (1+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 1) + \\omega $$\nTo evaluate this, we first must compute $\\omega \\cdot 1$. We use the successor clause again, with $1 = 0+1$, letting $\\gamma=0$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega \\cdot (0+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 0) + \\omega $$\nFrom the base clause for multiplication, $\\alpha \\cdot 0 = 0$, so $\\omega \\cdot 0 = 0$. This gives:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 1 = 0 + \\omega $$\nNow we evaluate $0+\\omega$. Since $\\omega$ is a limit ordinal, we use the limit clause for addition:\n$$ 0 + \\omega = \\sup\\{0 + \\delta \\mid \\delta  \\omega\\} $$\nAs $0$ is the additive identity for ordinals, $0+\\delta = \\delta$ for any ordinal $\\delta$. Thus:\n$$ 0 + \\omega = \\sup\\{\\delta \\mid \\delta  \\omega\\} = \\sup\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\} = \\omega $$\nSubstituting this back, we find $\\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega$.\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for $\\omega \\cdot 2$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 2 = (\\omega \\cdot 1) + \\omega = \\omega + \\omega $$\nThe expression $\\omega + \\omega$ denotes the ordinal that has the order type of two copies of $\\omega$ placed one after the other.
