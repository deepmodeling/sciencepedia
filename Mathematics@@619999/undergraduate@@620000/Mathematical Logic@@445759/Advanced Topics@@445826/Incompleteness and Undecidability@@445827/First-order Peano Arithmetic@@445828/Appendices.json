It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and fully compliant with the established principles of first-order logic and Peano Arithmetic. The premises are accurate, the language is precise, and the task is a standard, fundamental exercise in mathematical logic. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe task is to define a syntactic representation within the first-order language of Peano Arithmetic, $\\mathcal{L}_{PA}$, for each natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. These representations, called numerals and denoted $\\overline{n}$, must be closed terms constructed using only the constant symbol $0$ and the unary function symbol $S$.\n\nThe definition of the numeral $\\overline{n}$ is given by recursion on the natural number $n$. This approach mirrors the inductive structure of the natural numbers themselves, where each number is either $0$ or the successor of another number.\n\nThe formal recursive definition is as follows:\n1.  **Base Case**: For the natural number $0$, the corresponding numeral $\\overline{0}$ is defined to be the constant symbol $0$ from the language $\\mathcal{L}_{PA}$.\n    $$ \\overline{0} := 0 $$\n2.  **Recursive Step**: For any natural number $n$, if the numeral $\\overline{n}$ has been defined, then the numeral for the successor of $n$, denoted $n+1$, is defined by applying the successor function symbol $S$ to the term $\\overline{n}$.\n    $$ \\overline{n+1} := S(\\overline{n}) $$\n\nTo justify that this definition produces a valid term for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we use the principle of mathematical induction on $n$.\n**Base Case ($n=0$)**: The numeral is $\\overline{0} := 0$. According to the problem's term formation rules, \"if $c$ is a constant symbol, then $c$ is a term.\" Since $0$ is a constant symbol in $\\mathcal{L}_{PA}$, $\\overline{0}$ is a valid term.\n**Inductive Step**: Assume as the inductive hypothesis that for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the numeral $\\overline{k}$ is a valid term. We must show that $\\overline{k+1}$ is also a valid term. From the recursive definition, $\\overline{k+1} := S(\\overline{k})$. The symbol $S$ is a $1$-ary (unary) function symbol, and by the inductive hypothesis, $\\overline{k}$ is a term. The second rule of term formation states, \"if $f$ is a $k$-ary function symbol and $t_{1},\\dots,t_{k}$ are terms, then $f(t_{1},\\dots,t_{k})$ is a term.\" Applying this rule with $f$ as $S$ and the term $t_1$ as $\\overline{k}$, we conclude that $S(\\overline{k})$ is a valid term. Thus, $\\overline{k+1}$ is a valid term.\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, $\\overline{n}$ is a well-defined term for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNext, we must explain why $\\overline{n}$ is a closed term for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. A term is closed if it contains no free variables. We again proceed by induction on $n$.\n**Base Case ($n=0$)**: The term is $\\overline{0} := 0$. A constant symbol is not a variable, so the term $0$ contains no variables. Thus, $\\overline{0}$ is a closed term.\n**Inductive Step**: Assume as the inductive hypothesis that for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the numeral $\\overline{k}$ is a closed term, meaning it contains no variables. The numeral $\\overline{k+1}$ is constructed as $S(\\overline{k})$. The only new symbols introduced are the function symbol $S$ and parentheses, neither of which are variables. Since the sub-term $\\overline{k}$ is, by hypothesis, free of variables, the entire term $S(\\overline{k})$ must also be free of variables. Therefore, $\\overline{k+1}$ is a closed term.\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, $\\overline{n}$ is a closed term for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the specific closed-form expression for the numeral $\\overline{4}$. We apply the recursive definition step-by-step:\nThe numeral for $0$ is $\\overline{0} := 0$.\nThe numeral for $1$ is $\\overline{1} := S(\\overline{0}) = S(0)$.\nThe numeral for $2$ is $\\overline{2} := S(\\overline{1}) = S(S(0))$.\nThe numeral for $3$ is $\\overline{3} := S(\\overline{2}) = S(S(S(0)))$.\nThe numeral for $4$ is $\\overline{4} := S(\\overline{3}) = S(S(S(S(0))))$.\nThis final expression is a closed term constructed entirely from the symbols $S$ and $0$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{S(S(S(S(0))))}\n$$", "id": "3042003"}, {"introduction": "Once we can form terms, we can combine them into formulas to make assertions, but a formula's meaning is critically dependent on its structure, particularly how quantifiers like $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ bind variables.

Therefore, a solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, a justification that the expression is a well-formed formula (wff), and second, the determination of its set of free variables.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of Well-Formedness**\n\nWe use the recursive definitions for terms and formulas in a first-order language. Let the given expression be denoted by $\\Phi$.\n\n**Recursive Definition of a Term in $L_{\\mathrm{PA}}$:**\n1.  Any variable (e.g., $x$, $y$, $z$) is a term.\n2.  The constant symbol $0$ is a term.\n3.  If $t$ is a term, then $S(t)$ is a term.\n4.  If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms, then $(t_1+t_2)$ and $(t_1 \\times t_2)$ are terms. (By convention, outer parentheses are often omitted).\n\n**Recursive Definition of a Formula in $L_{\\mathrm{PA}}$:**\n1.  If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms, then $t_1 = t_2$ is an atomic formula.\n2.  If $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are formulas, then $(\\phi \\wedge \\psi)$ is a formula.\n3.  If $\\phi$ is a formula and $v$ is a variable, then $\\exists v\\,\\phi$ and $\\forall v\\,\\phi$ are formulas.\n\nWe now construct the given expression $\\Phi$ from the bottom up, showing that each component is either a valid term or a valid formula.\n\n1.  **Terms:**\n    -   The variables $x$, $y$, $z$ are terms by definition (Term Rule 1).\n    -   The constant symbol $0$ is a term by definition (Term Rule 2).\n    -   Since $x$ is a term, $S(x)$ is a term (Term Rule 3).\n    -   Since $x$ and $y$ are terms, $x+y$ is a term (Term Rule 4).\n    -   Since $z$ and $0$ are terms, $z \\times 0$ is a term (Term Rule 4).\n\n2.  **Atomic Formulas:**\n    -   Since $z$ and $x+y$ are terms, $z = x+y$ is an atomic formula (Formula Rule 1). Let's call this $\\phi_A$.\n    -   Since $x$ and $z \\times 0$ are terms, $x = z \\times 0$ is an atomic formula (Formula Rule 1). Let's call this $\\phi_B$.\n    -   Since $y$ and $S(x)$ are terms, $y = S(x)$ is an atomic formula (Formula Rule 1). Let's call this $\\phi_C$.\n\n3.  **Compound Formulas:**\n    -   Since $\\phi_A$ and $\\phi_B$ are formulas, $(\\phi_A \\wedge \\phi_B)$ is a formula (Formula Rule 2). This corresponds to $(z = x + y \\wedge x = z \\times 0)$. Let's call this formula $\\psi_1$.\n    -   Since $\\psi_1$ is a formula and $z$ is a variable, $\\exists z\\,\\psi_1$ is a formula (Formula Rule 3). This corresponds to $\\exists z\\,(z = x + y \\wedge x = z \\times 0)$. Let's call this formula $\\psi_2$.\n    -   Since $\\phi_C$ and $\\psi_2$ are formulas, $(\\phi_C \\wedge \\psi_2)$ is a formula (Formula Rule 2). This corresponds to $(y = S(x) \\wedge \\exists z\\,(z = x + y \\wedge x = z \\times 0))$. The given expression uses $\\bigl( \\dots \\bigr)$ for grouping, which is syntactically equivalent to $(\\dots)$. Let's call this formula $\\psi_3$.\n    -   Since $\\psi_3$ is a formula and $y$ is a variable, $\\exists y\\,\\psi_3$ is a formula (Formula Rule 3). Let's call this formula $\\psi_4$.\n    -   Since $\\psi_4$ is a formula and $x$ is a variable, $\\forall x\\,\\psi_4$ is a formula (Formula Rule 3). This is the original expression $\\Phi$.\n\nThis step-by-step construction, based on the primitive formation rules for terms and formulas, demonstrates that the expression $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\bigl(y = S(x) \\wedge \\exists z\\,(z = x + y \\wedge x = z \\times 0)\\bigr)$ is a well-formed formula in $L_{\\mathrm{PA}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Set of Free Variables**\n\nThe set of free variables of a formula $\\phi$, denoted $FV(\\phi)$, is defined recursively.\n\n**Recursive Definition of Free Variables ($FV$):**\n1.  For an atomic formula $t_1 = t_2$, $FV(t_1 = t_2) = V(t_1) \\cup V(t_2)$, where $V(t)$ is the set of variables appearing in term $t$.\n2.  For a formula $(\\phi \\wedge \\psi)$, $FV(\\phi \\wedge \\psi) = FV(\\phi) \\cup FV(\\psi)$.\n3.  For a formula $\\exists v\\,\\phi$, $FV(\\exists v\\,\\phi) = FV(\\phi) \\setminus \\{v\\}$.\n4.  For a formula $\\forall v\\,\\phi$, $FV(\\forall v\\,\\phi) = FV(\\phi) \\setminus \\{v\\}$.\n\nWe apply these rules to the formula $\\Phi$ and its subformulas, as identified in Part 1.\n\n1.  **Atomic Formulas:**\n    -   $FV(\\phi_A) = FV(z = x+y) = V(z) \\cup V(x+y) = \\{z\\} \\cup (\\{x\\} \\cup \\{y\\}) = \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n    -   $FV(\\phi_B) = FV(x = z \\times 0) = V(x) \\cup V(z \\times 0) = \\{x\\} \\cup \\{z\\} = \\{x, z\\}$.\n    -   $FV(\\phi_C) = FV(y = S(x)) = V(y) \\cup V(S(x)) = \\{y\\} \\cup \\{x\\} = \\{x, y\\}$.\n\n2.  **Compound Formulas:**\n    -   $FV(\\psi_1) = FV(\\phi_A \\wedge \\phi_B) = FV(\\phi_A) \\cup FV(\\phi_B) = \\{x, y, z\\} \\cup \\{x, z\\} = \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n    -   $FV(\\psi_2) = FV(\\exists z\\,\\psi_1) = FV(\\psi_1) \\setminus \\{z\\} = \\{x, y, z\\} \\setminus \\{z\\} = \\{x, y\\}$.\n    -   $FV(\\psi_3) = FV(\\phi_C \\wedge \\psi_2) = FV(\\phi_C) \\cup FV(\\psi_2) = \\{x, y\\} \\cup \\{x, y\\} = \\{x, y\\}$.\n    -   $FV(\\psi_4) = FV(\\exists y\\,\\psi_3) = FV(\\psi_3) \\setminus \\{y\\} = \\{x, y\\} \\setminus \\{y\\} = \\{x\\}$.\n    -   $FV(\\Phi) = FV(\\forall x\\,\\psi_4) = FV(\\psi_4) \\setminus \\{x\\} = \\{x\\} \\setminus \\{x\\} = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe set of free variables in the given formula is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. A formula with no free variables is known as a sentence or a closed formula.\n\n**Part 3: Cardinality of the Set of Free Variables**\n\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set.

A solution can be derived by analyzing the correctness of each component in the provided options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nTo correctly evaluate the options, we first state the formal definitions of the concepts in question.\n\n1.  **Syntactic Equality of Terms:** In a formal language, terms are syntactic objects, i.e., finite sequences of symbols. Two terms $t_1$ and $t_2$ are syntactically equal (or identical), often written $t_1 \\equiv t_2$, if and only if they consist of the exact same sequence of symbols in the same order. This is a purely structural comparison of the terms as strings. It is distinct from the notion of being provably equal in a theory like Peano Arithmetic (PA), i.e., $PA \\vdash t_1 = t_2$.\n\n2.  **Semantic Equality of Terms:** Semantics attributes meaning to syntactic objects. Given an $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{PA}}$-interpretation $\\mathcal{M}$ with domain $D_{\\mathcal{M}}$, and a variable assignment $s: \\text{Variables} \\to D_{\\mathcal{M}}$, every term $t$ is assigned a value, or denotation, $\\llbracket t \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M},s} \\in D_{\\mathcal{M}}$. This assignment is defined recursively based on the structure of the term. Two terms $t_1$ and $t_2$ are semantically equal with respect to the interpretation $\\mathcal{M}$ and assignment $s$ if and only if their denotations are the same element in the domain, i.e., $\\llbracket t_1 \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M},s} = \\llbracket t_2 \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M},s}$.\n\n3.  **Example in the Standard Model $\\mathcal{N}$:** The standard model $\\mathcal{N}$ has the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$ as its domain. For closed terms (terms without variables), the denotation is independent of any variable assignment.

Example in $\\mathbb{N}$: $0 \\times S(0)$ and $0$ denote the same element.**\n- The definition of syntactic equality is incorrect; it confuses a syntactic property with a semantic property in a specific model.\n- The definition of semantic equality is incorrect; it confuses semantic equality with syntactic equality. The two definitions have essentially been swapped and misstated.\n- The example is correct: $0 \\times S(0)$ and $0$ are distinct terms, and $\\llbracket 0 \\times S(0) \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{N}} = 0 \\times 1 = 0$, while $\\llbracket 0 \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{N}} = 0$. However, the definitions are fundamentally flawed.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nOnly option A provides correct definitions for both syntactic and semantic equality, along with a correct illustrative example.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3042049"}]}
