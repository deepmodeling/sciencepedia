No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in computability theory. It asks for a justification of the existence of an index for the constant zero function using Kleene's recursion theorem, and then to compute a value of this function. We can proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe core tool required is Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem, which can be stated as follows: For any total computable function $g \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, there exists an index $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the partial computable functions indexed by $n$ and $g(n)$ are identical. Symbolically, this is written as $\\varphi_n = \\varphi_{g(n)}$. This index $n$ is often called a fixed point of the function $g$.\n\nThe problem provides a total computable function $f \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$. We can therefore apply Kleene's recursion theorem directly to this function $f$. By the theorem, there must exist an index, which we will call $e \\in \\mathbb{N}$, such that $\\varphi_e = \\varphi_{f(e)}$.\n\nNext, we use the property of the function $f$ given in the problem statement. It is stated that for every index $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and for all inputs $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the function with index $f(k)$ is the constant zero function. This means $\\varphi_{f(k)}(x) = 0$ for all $k, x \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNow, we can combine these two facts. We have a specific index $e$ which is a fixed point for $f$. The property of $f$ holds for any index $k$, so it must hold for our specific index $e$. Substituting $k=e$ into the property of $f$, we find that the function $\\varphi_{f(e)}$ is the constant zero function. That is, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\varphi_{f(e)}(x) = 0$.\n\nSince we know from the recursion theorem that $\\varphi_e = \\varphi_{f(e)}$, it follows immediately that $\\varphi_e$ must also be the constant zero function. Thus, for our fixed-point index $e$, it is true that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\varphi_e(x) = 0$. This rigorously justifies the existence of an index $e$ for the constant zero function, as required by the problem.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the value of $\\varphi_e(2^{10} + 3)$. We have just established that $\\varphi_e$ is the constant zero function, which means its output is $0$ for any input from its domain $\\mathbb{N}$. The input is $2^{10} + 3 = 1024 + 3 = 1027$, which is a natural number.\n\nTherefore, we can evaluate the function:\n$$\n\\varphi_e(2^{10} + 3) = \\varphi_e(1027) = 0\n$$\nThe value is exactly $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3045831"}, {"introduction": "Beyond merely guaranteeing existence, the proof of the Kleene Recursion Theorem provides a concrete method for constructing self-referential programs.

It is a well-posed problem within the established framework of computability theory, a subfield of mathematical logic. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The task is to construct the index of a self-referential program (a quine) from a given set of primitive computable functions and indices.\n\nThe objective is to find an index $e^{\\star} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all inputs $y \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the partial computable function $\\varphi_{e^{\\star}}$ halts and outputs its own index: $\\varphi_{e^{\\star}}(y) = e^{\\star}$.\n\nThe construction relies fundamentally on the Kleene $s$-$m$-$n$ theorem.

That is, $\\varphi_{s(e,a)}(y) = \\varphi_e^{(2)}(a,y)$. Conceptually, the $s$-$m$-$n$ theorem formalizes the process of specialization or partial evaluation: it provides a computable way to transform a general-purpose program (index $e$) into a specialized program (index $s(e,a)$) by fixing one of its inputs. This ability for programs to mechanically generate indices for other programs is the essential mechanism that enables the self-reference required for a quine, as demonstrated by the constructive proof of Kleene's Recursion Theorem.\n\nThe construction proceeds by first analyzing the function $D(x,y)$ provided in the problem statement. This function is defined as $D(x,y) = \\varphi_{s(p, s(x,x))}(y)$. We are given that $d$ is an index for this function, meaning $\\varphi_d^{(2)}(x,y) = D(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nLet us simplify the expression for $D(x,y)$.\nBy the definition of the $s$-$m$-$n$ theorem, we can state that for any $e, a, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{s(e,a)}(y) = \\varphi_{e}^{(2)}(a,y)\n$$\nIn the expression for $D(x,y)$, we can identify $e=p$ and $a=s(x,x)$.

Substituting $z = s(x,x)$, we get:\n$$\n\\varphi_{p}^{(2)}(s(x,x), y) = s(x,x)\n$$\nCombining these results, we find the simplified form of $D(x,y)$:\n$$\nD(x,y) = \\varphi_{s(p, s(x,x))}(y) = s(x,x)\n$$\nSince $d$ is the index for $D(x,y)$, we have established a crucial property of the program with index $d$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{d}^{(2)}(x,y) = s(x,x)\n$$\nThis means that the binary program with index $d$ takes two inputs, $x$ and $y$, ignores the second input $y$, and returns the value $s(x,x)$.\n\nWe now employ a construction that mirrors the proof of Kleene's Recursion Theorem to find the desired fixed point. The theorem's constructive proof suggests that for a function like $\\varphi_d^{(2)}$, a fixed point can often be found by applying the $s$-function to the index of the function itself. Let us propose the candidate index $e^{\\star}$ for our quine as:\n$$\ne^{\\star} = s(d,d)\n$$\nTo verify that this index corresponds to a quine, we must evaluate the function $\\varphi_{e^{\\star}}(y)$ for an arbitrary input $y \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nBy definition of $e^{\\star}$, we have:\n$$\n\\varphi_{e^{\\star}}(y) = \\varphi_{s(d,d)}(y)\n$$\nWe apply the $s$-$m$-$n$ theorem to the right-hand side, with $e=d$ and $a=d$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{s(d,d)}(y) = \\varphi_{d}^{(2)}(d,y)\n$$\nNow, we use our previously derived property of the function $\\varphi_d^{(2)}$, which states that $\\varphi_d^{(2)}(x,y) = s(x,x)$ for all $x,y$.

It is a standard exercise illustrating the application of Kleene's recursion theorem, the s-m-n theorem, and Rice's theorem, as well as the crucial distinction between extensional and syntactic properties of programs. We proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a step-by-step construction and analysis, culminating in a final calculation. We will address each part in sequence.\n\n1.  **Existence of an index $p$ for the constant zero function**\n\nWe are asked to use Kleene's recursion theorem to justify the existence of an index $p$ such that $\\varphi_{p}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nConsider the function $\\psi(e, x) = 0$. This function is clearly total and computable, as it ignores its inputs and outputs a constant. By the s-m-n theorem (in a simplified form where the second parameter is absent), there exists a total computable function, which we denote as $F: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, such that for any index $e \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\varphi_{F(e)}(x) = \\psi(e, x)$. Substituting the definition of $\\psi$, we have $\\varphi_{F(e)}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe function $F$ is a total computable transformer on indices. By Kleene's recursion theorem, there must exist a fixed point for this transformer, i.e., an index $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\varphi_{p} = \\varphi_{F(p)}$.\n\nFrom the definition of $F$, we know that $\\varphi_{F(p)}$ is the partial function that computes $\\varphi_{F(p)}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Since $\\varphi_{p} = \\varphi_{F(p)}$, it follows directly that $\\varphi_{p}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This establishes the existence of the required index $p$. We fix this specific index $p$ for the remainder of the problem.\n\n2.  **Definition of the wrapper function $b(n, p)$**\n\nWe need to define a total computable and injective function $b(n, p)$ using the s-m-n theorem. This function should produce an index for a program that behaves identically to the program with index $p$, but after executing $n$ syntactic \"no-op\" (no operation) steps.\n\nLet's define a three-argument function $\\Psi(n, p, x)$. The intended behavior of $\\Psi$ is to simulate the computation of $\\varphi_{p}(x)$, but the underlying Turing Machine code for $\\Psi$ will depend syntactically on $n$. However, the *functional* output is independent of $n$. We define the function as $\\Psi(n, p, x) = \\varphi_{p}(x)$. By the Church-Turing thesis and the existence of a Universal Turing Machine, the function $\\Psi(n, p, x)$ is a partial computable function of its three arguments.\n\nBy the s-m-n theorem, there exists a total computable function, which we will call $b$, such that for all $n, p, x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $\\varphi_{b(n,p)}(x) = \\Psi(n,p,x)$. Substituting our definition of $\\Psi$, we get $\\varphi_{b(n,p)}(x) = \\varphi_{p}(x)$.\n\nThe problem states that we can assume the underlying model allows for embedding $n$ literally into the code of the program $b(n,p)$ as a sequence of no-op instructions. This ensures that if $(n_1, p_1) \\neq (n_2, p_2)$, then the resulting codes $b(n_1, p_1)$ and $b(n_2, p_2)$ are distinct. Hence, the function $b: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ is injective.\n\n3.  **Construction and analysis of $e_1$ and $e_2$**\n\nLet $p$ be the index for the constant zero function, as found in part 1. We define two new indices, $e_1$ and $e_2$, using the wrapper function $b$ from part 2:\n$$e_1 = b(3, p)$$\n$$e_2 = b(7, p)$$\n\nFirst, we argue that $\\varphi_{e_1} = \\varphi_{e_2}$. From the definition of $b$, we have $\\varphi_{b(n,p)}(x) = \\varphi_{p}(x)$ for all $n, p, x$.\nFor $e_1$, we have $\\varphi_{e_1}(x) = \\varphi_{b(3,p)}(x) = \\varphi_{p}(x)$ for all $x$.\nFor $e_2$, we have $\\varphi_{e_2}(x) = \\varphi_{b(7,p)}(x) = \\varphi_{p}(x)$ for all $x$.\nSince both $\\varphi_{e_1}$ and $\\varphi_{e_2}$ are equal to the same function $\\varphi_p$, they must be equal to each other: $\\varphi_{e_1} = \\varphi_{e_2}$.\n\nNext, we argue that $e_1 \\neq e_2$. The function $b$ is injective. The inputs to $b$ for $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the pairs $(3, p)$ and $(7, p)$, respectively. Since $3 \\neq 7$, the pairs are distinct: $(3, p) \\neq (7, p)$. Because $b$ is injective, it maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs. Therefore, $b(3,p) \\neq b(7,p)$, which means $e_1 \\neq e_2$.\n\n4.  **The extensional property $E(e)$**\n\nThe property $E$ is defined as:\n$$E(e) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N},\\, \\varphi_{e}(x) = 0, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}$$\nRice's theorem states that any non-trivial extensional property of partial computable functions is undecidable. To apply the theorem, we must verify that $E$ is both extensional and non-trivial.\n\n- **Extensionality**: Suppose $\\varphi_e = \\varphi_{e'}$. If $\\forall x, \\varphi_e(x)=0$, then it must also be that $\\forall x, \\varphi_{e'}(x)=0$. In this case, $E(e) = 1$ and $E(e')=1$. If it is not the case that $\\forall x, \\varphi_e(x)=0$, then it is also not the case for $\\varphi_{e'}$. In this case, $E(e)=0$ and $E(e')=0$. In all scenarios, if $\\varphi_e = \\varphi_{e'}$, then $E(e) = E(e')$. Thus, $E$ is an extensional property.\n\n- **Non-triviality**: A property is non-trivial if it is true for at least one function and false for at least one other. In part 1, we established the existence of an index $p$ such that $\\varphi_p$ is the constant zero function. So, $E(p) = 1$. Now consider the function that is everywhere undefined. An index for this function can be a program that enters an infinite loop immediately, let's call this index $u$. Since $\\varphi_u$ is not the constant zero function, $E(u) = 0$. Since the property holds for some indices and not for others, it is non-trivial.\n\nSince $E$ is a non-trivial extensional property, Rice's theorem implies that $E$ is undecidable.\n\nFinally, we verify that $E(e_1) = E(e_2)$. From part 3, we know $\\varphi_{e_1} = \\varphi_{e_2} = \\varphi_p$. Since $\\varphi_p$ is the constant zero function, both $\\varphi_{e_1}$ and $\\varphi_{e_2}$ are also the constant zero function. According to the definition of $E$, this means $E(e_1) = 1$ and $E(e_2) = 1$. Therefore, $E(e_1) = E(e_2)$.\n\n5.  **The syntactic property $S(e)$**\n\nThe property $S$ is defined for the fixed index $p$ from part 1 as:\n$$S(e) = \\begin{cases} n & \\text{if } e = b(n,p) \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}$$\nWe must show that $S$ is decidable. To compute $S(e)$ for a given input $e$, we need an algorithm that always halts. The definition of $S$ is based on whether the index $e$ has a specific syntactic structure, namely the structure produced by the wrapper function $b(n,p)$.\n\nThe function $b$ is total and computable. The index $p$ is a fixed constant. An algorithm to decide $S(e)$ can be designed as follows:\nGiven an input index $e$, we can analyze its code structure. We can check if the code of machine $e$ begins with a block of no-op instructions, and if the remainder of the code implements a simulation of the machine with the known index $p$. This kind of structural analysis or \"decompilation\" is a finite process that operates on the syntax of the program code, not its behavior.\nFormally, the algorithm is:\n1.  Parse the description of the TM with code $e$.\n2.  Check if it matches the template \"a sequence of no-op instructions followed by the code for a universal TM simulating machine $p$\".\n3.  If it does not match this template, halt and output $0$.\n4.  If it does match, count the number of leading no-op instructions, let this count be $n$. Halt and output $n$.\n\nThis procedure always terminates because it is a finite check on the structure of the given code $e$. Therefore, the function $S(e)$ is computable, meaning the property $S$ is decidable.\n\nNext, we show that $S(e_1) \\neq S(e_2)$.\nFor $e_1 = b(3, p)$, the input $e_1$ matches the condition $e = b(n,p)$ with $n=3$. By the definition of $S$, we have $S(e_1) = 3$.\nFor $e_2 = b(7, p)$, the input $e_2$ matches the condition $e = b(n,p)$ with $n=7$. By the definition of $S$, we have $S(e_2) = 7$.\nSince $3 \\neq 7$, we have $S(e_1) \\neq S(e_2)$. This highlights that $S$ is a syntactic property, as it can distinguish between two distinct programs ($e_1 \\neq e_2$) even when they compute the exact same function ($\\varphi_{e_1} = \\varphi_{e_2}$).\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the value of $F$:\n$$F = E(e_{1}) + E(e_{2}) + \\big|S(e_{1}) - S(e_{2})\\big|$$\nUsing the values we derived in the previous parts:\n- From part 4, $E(e_1) = 1$.\n- From part 4, $E(e_2) = 1$.\n- From part 5, $S(e_1) = 3$.\n- From part 5, $S(e_2) = 7$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $F$:\n$$F = 1 + 1 + |3 - 7|$$\n$$F = 2 + |-4|$$\n$$F = 2 + 4$$\n$$F = 6$$\nThe final value is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2982151"}]}
