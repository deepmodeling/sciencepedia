There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a correct and standard question about a fundamental construction in computability theory. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal of the finite-injury priority method (as pioneered by Friedberg and Muchnik) is to construct two Turing-incomparable r.e. sets, $A$ and $B$. This is achieved by satisfying an infinite list of requirements for all $e \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n- $R_e^A: \\Phi_e^B \\neq \\chi_A$\n- $R_e^B: \\Psi_e^A \\neq \\chi_B$\n\nThe requirements are given a priority ordering, typically based on their index (e.g., $R_0^A, R_0^B, R_1^A, R_1^B, \\dots$). Higher priority is given to requirements with lower indices.\n\nLet's focus on the strategy for a single requirement, say $R_e^A: \\Phi_e^B \\neq \\chi_A$. The strategy is to establish a disagreement between $\\Phi_e^B$ and $\\chi_A$ on a specific input, the witness $x_e$.\n1. A large number $x_e$, not yet in $A$ or $B$, is chosen as the witness for $R_e^A$. Initially, $x_e \\notin A$, so $\\chi_A(x_e) = 0$.\n2. The construction proceeds in stages. At each stage $s$, we check if the computation $\\Phi_e^{B_s}(x_e)$ converges to $0$. $B_s$ is the finite approximation of $B$ at stage $s$.\n3. If we find a stage $s$ such that $\\Phi_e^{B_s}(x_e)[s] \\downarrow = 0$, we have an opportunity to diagonalize. By enumerating $x_e$ into $A$, we would make $\\chi_A(x_e) = 1$, thus ensuring $\\Phi_e^B(x_e) \\neq \\chi_A(x_e)$ and satisfying the requirement.\n4. However, for this diagonalization to be valid, the computation $\\Phi_e^{B_s}(x_e)$ must be preserved. This computation depends on the oracle $B$ only for inputs up to a certain maximum value, which is called the **use** of the computation, denoted $u_e^B(x_e)[s]$. If any number $z \\le u_e^B(x_e)[s]$ is later enumerated into $B$, the computation is destroyed (or \"injured\").\n5. To protect this computation, requirement $R_e^A$ imposes a **restraint** on set $B$. This restraint is a directive to all lower-priority requirements that they are forbidden from enumerating any number less than or equal to the use into $B$.\n6. Therefore, the correct definition for the restraint that $R_e^A$ imposes on $B$ at stage $s$ is $r_e^B[s] = u_e^B(x_e)[s]$. Symmetrically, the restraint that $R_e^B$ imposes on $A$ (to protect a computation $\\Psi_e^{A_s}(y_e)$) is $r_e^A[s] = u_e^A(y_e)[s]$. If a requirement is not currently protecting a computation (e.g., it is waiting for one to converge, or has already been satisfied and needs no further action), it imposes no restraint, i.e., its restraint is $0$.\n\nNow, consider what happens when a higher-priority requirement, say $R_i^B$ with $ie$, needs to act. Suppose $R_i^B$ acts by enumerating its witness $y_i$ into $B$ to satisfy itself. If this witness $y_i$ is less than or equal to the restraint imposed by $R_e^A$ (i.e., $y_i \\le r_e^B[s] = u_e^B(x_e)[s]$), then the computation that $R_e^A$ was protecting is destroyed. This event is called an **injury**.\n\nWhen requirement $R_e^A$ is injured:\n1. The computation it was protecting is now invalid.\n2. The restraint $r_e^B[s]$ based on that computation is now meaningless and must be removed. It is reset to $0$.\n3. The requirement must start its strategy anew. This typically involves selecting a new, larger witness and waiting for a new computation to converge. The old witness is discarded.\n\nThe \"finite-injury\" property comes from the fact that each requirement $R_e$ can only be injured by the finitely many higher-priority requirements ($R_i$ with $ie$). Since each of these higher-priority requirements will eventually be satisfied and cease to act, $R_e$ will only be injured a finite number of times. After its last injury, it can successfully execute its strategy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nBased on the above derivation, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. At stage $s$, if $R_e^B$ has a current computation $\\Psi_e^A(y_e)[s]$ with use $u_e^A(y_e)[s]$, set $r_e^A[s] := u_e^A(y_e)[s]$, and if $R_e^A$ has a current computation $\\Phi_e^B(x_e)[s]$ with use $u_e^B(x_e)[s]$, set $r_e^B[s] := u_e^B(x_e)[s]$. If no computation is currently protected, set the corresponding restraint to $0$. If a higher-priority requirement enumerates into $A$ below $r_e^A[s]$ or into $B$ below $r_e^B[s]$, the injured requirement discards its current witness, resets its restraint to $0$, and later redefines the restraint to the use of the next protected computation; when not injured, restraints are nondecreasing as stages advance.**\nThis option correctly states that the restraint value is the use of the computation being protected ($r_e^A[s] = u_e^A(y_e)[s]$ and $r_e^B[s] = u_e^B(x_e)[s]$). It correctly states that the restraint is $0$ if no computation is being protected. It correctly describes the response to injury: the injured requirement discards its witness and resets its restraint to $0$ to start over. The final clause, that restraints are non-decreasing when not injured, is also correct, as a computation at a later stage for the same input will use at least the same oracle information. This option provides a complete and accurate description of the restraint mechanism.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. At stage $s$, set $r_e^A[s] := y_e$ and $r_e^B[s] := x_e$ for the current witnesses. On injury, increment the restraint by $1$ but keep the same witness, because changing the witness would cause divergence.**\nThis is incorrect. The restraint must be equal to the *use* of the computation, not the *witness*. The use can be, and often is, much larger than the witness ($u_e^B(x_e)[s]  x_e$). A restraint equal to the witness would fail to protect the computation. Furthermore, the response to injury is wrong; the old restraint is nullified, not incremented. Discarding the witness is the standard way to ensure the finite-injury lemma holds.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. At stage $s$, set both $r_e^A[s]$ and $r_e^B[s]$ equal to $s$. On injury, do nothing to the restraint functions; the stage counter alone guarantees protection since it grows.**\nThis is incorrect. A restraint must be tied to the specific computation's use. A restraint of $s$ is both insufficient (if use $ s$) and overly restrictive (if use $\\ll s$). Doing nothing on injury is also fundamentally wrong, as the reason for the restraint has been eliminated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. At stage $s$, define $r_e^A[s]$ as the cardinality of $A \\cap [0,s]$ and $r_e^B[s]$ as the cardinality of $B \\cap [0,s]$. On injury, decrease the restraint by $1$ to prevent oscillations.**\nThis is incorrect. The cardinality of a set has no direct relationship to the use of a Turing machine computation. The use is an upper bound on oracle queries, while cardinality is a count. The described restraint offers no real protection. The response to injury is arbitrary and incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. At stage $s$, set $r_e^A[s]$ and $r_e^B[s]$ to the maximum element ever enumerated into $A$ and $B$, respectively, up to stage $s$. On injury, double the restraint to make future injuries less likely.**\nThis is incorrect. Much like options C and D, this definition of restraint is not connected to the use of the computation needing protection. The use could be far larger than any element yet enumerated into the oracle. The response to injury (\"doubling\" the restraint) is arbitrary and not part of the standard construction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3048755"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand what an injury is, we must guarantee that no requirement is injured infinitely often, as this would prevent its strategy from ever succeeding.

The construction proceeds via a computable, stage-by-stage procedure that satisfies a list of requirements arranged in a fixed priority order. At each stage, exactly one requirement acts. For each requirement $P_{i}$, a restraint function $r_{i}(s)$ is maintained that is nondecreasing in the stage $s$ and represents the largest number below which lower-priority requirements are forbidden to enumerate or use witnesses in their diagonalizations. A lower-priority requirement $Q$ is said to suffer an injury at stage $s$ if a higher-priority requirement $P_{i}$ changes its restraint so that $r_{i}(s)$ exceeds the current witness chosen by $Q$, thereby canceling or destroying $Q$’s current strategy and forcing $Q$ to restart with a new witness above the current maximum restraint.\n\nAssume the following setting within this construction:\n- There are $k$ requirements $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{k}$ of strictly higher priority than a fixed lower-priority requirement $Q$.\n- For each $i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}$, the restraint $r_{i}(s)$ is nondecreasing in $s$ and undergoes exactly $n_{i}$ strict increases over the entire construction (that is, there are exactly $n_{i}$ stages at which $r_{i}$ is raised to a strictly larger value).\n- Whenever $Q$ selects a new witness $x$ at a stage $t$, it chooses $x$ strictly greater than the current maximum higher-priority restraint, that is $x  R(t)$, where $R(t) = \\max\\{r_{1}(t), r_{2}(t), \\dots, r_{k}(t)\\}$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, compute an explicit tight upper bound, expressed as a closed-form analytic expression in $n_{1}, n_{2}, \\dots, n_{k}$, on the total number of injuries that $Q$ can suffer during the construction.

A strict increase at stage $s$ means $r_i(s)  r_i(s-1)$. Let $\\mathcal{E}_i$ be the set of stages where $r_i$ strictly increases. We are given that $|\\mathcal{E}_i| = n_i$. Since at most one requirement acts at any stage, the sets $\\mathcal{E}_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ are disjoint.\n\nThe lower-priority requirement $Q$ has a strategy that depends on a chosen witness, let's call it $w$.\nAn injury to $Q$ at stage $s$ is defined as an event where a higher-priority requirement $P_i$ acts, increases its restraint, and this new restraint value exceeds $Q$'s current witness. That is, if $w_{old}$ was the witness for $Q$ at stage $s-1$, an injury occurs at stage $s$ if there exists an $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ such that $r_i(s)  r_i(s-1)$ and $r_i(s)  w_{old}$.\n\nAfter an injury, $Q$'s strategy is canceled, and it must eventually choose a new witness. When $Q$ chooses a new witness $w_{new}$ at a stage $t$, it does so according to the rule:\n$w_{new}  R(t)$, where $R(t) = \\max\\{r_1(t), r_2(t), \\dots, r_k(t)\\}$.\n\nLet's analyze the causal relationship between restraint increases and injuries. An injury to $Q$ is always caused by a strict increase in some higher-priority restraint. We need to determine the maximum number of such injuries.\n\nConsider a single, specific event of a restraint increase. Let this event occur at stage $s_{event}$, where requirement $P_i$ acts and increases its restraint to a new value $r_i(s_{event})$, with $r_i(s_{event})  r_i(s_{event}-1)$.\nSuppose this event causes an injury to $Q$. This means that $Q$'s witness at that time, let it be $w$, satisfies $r_i(s_{event})  w$.\nBecause of this injury, $Q$ will need to appoint a new witness. Let's say this happens at some later stage $t_{new}$, where $t_{new}  s_{event}$. The new witness, $w_{new}$, must be chosen such that:\n$$w_{new}  R(t_{new}) = \\max_{j=1}^{k} \\{r_j(t_{new})\\}$$\nSince $t_{new}  s_{event}$ and all restraint functions $r_j(s)$ are nondecreasing in $s$, we have $r_j(t_{new}) \\ge r_j(s_{event})$ for all $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$.\nIn particular, for our requirement $P_i$, we have $r_i(t_{new}) \\ge r_i(s_{event})$.\nTherefore, the new witness $w_{new}$ must satisfy:\n$$w_{new}  R(t_{new}) \\ge r_i(t_{new}) \\ge r_i(s_{event})$$\nThis implies that $w_{new}$ is strictly greater than the restraint value $r_i(s_{event})$ that was set at the stage of the injury. Any subsequent witness chosen by $Q$ will be at least as large as $w_{new}$, and likely larger.\nThis means that the specific restraint increase event by $P_i$ at stage $s_{event}$ cannot injure the new witness $w_{new}$ or any future witnesses chosen by $Q$.\n\nThis establishes a crucial one-to-one principle: each distinct event of a strict restraint increase by a higher-priority requirement can cause at most one injury to requirement $Q$ throughout the entire construction.\n\nThe total number of such \"injurious-in-principle\" events is the total number of times any of the higher-priority restraints strictly increase.\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, the restraint $r_i$ increases $n_i$ times.\nSince only one requirement acts per stage, these increase events are all distinct.\nThe total number of such events is the sum over all higher-priority requirements:\n$$\\text{Total increase events} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i$$\nSince each injury to $Q$ must be caused by one of these unique events, the total number of injuries cannot exceed the total number of events.\nTherefore, an upper bound on the number of injuries to $Q$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i$.\n\nTo show that this bound is tight, we must demonstrate that a scenario can exist where this maximum number of injuries is actually achieved. This is a \"worst-case\" scenario for $Q$. We need to show that it is possible for every single higher-priority restraint increase to cause an injury to $Q$.\n\nLet the total of $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ restraint-increase events be ordered chronologically by stage: $e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_N$, occurring at stages $s_1  s_2  \\dots  s_N$.\n1. Let $Q$ begin by choosing an initial witness $w_0$ at some stage $t_0  s_1$.\n2. At stage $s_1$, the first increase event $e_1$ occurs (say, by requirement $P_{j_1}$). The construction can set the new restraint value $r_{j_1}(s_1)$ to be greater than $w_0$. This is possible because the choice of restraint value is part of the construction. This causes the first injury to $Q$.\n3. After this injury, $Q$ must choose a new witness. This happens at some stage $t_1  s_1$. Let the new witness be $w_1$. By rule, $w_1  R(t_1)$, so $w_1$ is larger than all restraints at stage $t_1$, including the newly set $r_{j_1}(s_1)$.\n4. At stage $s_2  t_1$, the second increase event $e_2$ occurs (by requirement $P_{j_2}$). The construction can set the new restraint $r_{j_2}(s_2)$ to be greater than $w_1$, causing the second injury to $Q$.\n5. This process can be repeated for every increase event. For the $m$-th event $e_m$ at stage $s_m$, it occurs after $Q$ has chosen its $(m-1)$-th witness $w_{m-1}$ (at stage $t_{m-1}  s_m$). The construction can set the new restraint value to be greater than $w_{m-1}$, causing the $m$-th injury. Then $Q$ will choose a new, larger witness $w_m$ at a stage $t_m  s_m$, and the cycle continues.\n\nSince this procedure can be followed for all $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ increase events, it is possible for $Q$ to be injured exactly that many times.\nThis confirms that the upper bound $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ is tight.\n\nThe tight upper bound on the total number of injuries that $Q$ can suffer is the total number of strict increases across all higher-priority restraints.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}}\n$$", "id": "3048792"}, {"introduction": "A successful priority construction must manage an infinite list of requirements, each potentially needing an infinite supply of numbers to use as witnesses.

The sequence of markers $\\langle m_{e,s} : s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle$ changes only finitely many times (finite injury/mind changes for $Q_{e}$).\n- **Condition for Goal 2**: Goal $2$ must be achieved under the provision that for every $i  e$, the restraint sequence $\\langle r_{i,s} : s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle$ stabilizes to a finite limit, i.e., $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} r_{i,s}$ exists and is finite.\n- **Question**: Which of the four described uniform policies (A, B, C, D) achieve both design goals?\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is correctly situated within mathematical logic, specifically computability theory. The concepts described—Post's problem, priority method, c.e. sets, requirements, restraints, injury, Turing functionals—are standard and well-defined in this field. The problem represents a fundamental aspect of constructing c.e. sets with specific properties. It is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear set of criteria (two design goals) and a clear hypothesis (stabilization of higher-priority restraints). It then asks for an evaluation of four specific algorithms (policies) against these criteria. For each policy, a definite conclusion (achieves goals or not) can be logically derived.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary definitions and conditions to analyze the policies. The concept of a restraint, injury, priority, and the crucial assumption about the behavior of higher-priority requirements are all explicitly laid out. The setup is internally consistent.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is not unrealistic (within mathematics), ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It is a standard conceptual problem in its domain.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated question in computability theory. The solution process can now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze each policy for a requirement $Q_{e}$ under the hypothesis that all higher-priority requirements are \"finitely acting\". Let's formalize this. For a fixed requirement $Q_{e}$, we are given that for each $i  e$, the sequence of restraints $\\langle r_{i,s} : s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle$ converges to a finite limit. Let $R_{i} = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} r_{i,s}$. This implies that for each $i  e$, there exists a stage $s_{i}$ such that for all $s \\geq s_{i}$, $r_{i,s} = R_{i}$.\n\nLet $R_{e,s} = \\max_{ie} r_{i,s}$ be the total restraint imposed on $Q_e$ by higher-priority requirements at stage $s$. Let $s_{e}^{*} = \\max_{ie} s_{i}$. For any stage $s \\geq s_{e}^{*}$, the restraint $R_{e,s}$ will be constant: $R_{e,s} = \\max_{ie} R_{i}$. Let's call this final, stable restraint value $R_{e}$. Since each $R_i$ is finite, $R_e$ is also finite.\n\nThe task is to verify if, under this condition, a given policy guarantees:\n1.  The set of potential witnesses $S_e$ is infinite and computable.\n2.  The marker $m_{e,s}$ changes only finitely many times, i.e., the sequence $\\langle m_{e,s} : s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle$ eventually becomes constant.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The policy guarantees both infinitely many potential witnesses for each requirement and only finitely many mind changes under stabilized higher-priority restraints.**\n\nThe policy is defined as:\n-   $S_{e} = \\{\\langle e,k \\rangle : k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot \\rangle$ is a computable pairing function.\n-   At stage $s$, $m_{e,s}$ is set to the least element of $S_{e}$ that is greater than $R_{e,s} = \\max_{ie} r_{i,s}$.\n\nLet's evaluate this policy against the two goals.\n\n1.  **Infinite Witness Set**: The set $S_{e}$ is the set of all pairs with the first component equal to $e$. Since $k$ ranges over all natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$, $S_e$ is an infinite set. Since the pairing function is computable, $S_e$ is a computable set. Thus, Goal 1 is met.\n\n2.  **Finite Mind Changes**: The rule for the marker is $m_{e,s} = \\min \\{x \\in S_{e} \\mid x  R_{e,s}\\}$. The value of $m_{e,s}$ is determined entirely by the value of $R_{e,s}$.\n    From our analysis above, we know there exists a stage $s_{e}^{*}$ and a finite value $R_{e}$ such that for all $s \\geq s_{e}^{*}$, $R_{e,s} = R_{e}$.\n    Therefore, for all $s \\geq s_{e}^{*}$, the rule for setting the marker becomes:\n    $$m_{e,s} = \\min \\{x \\in S_{e} \\mid x  R_{e}\\}$$\n    Since $S_{e}$ is an infinite set of natural numbers, such a minimum element exists and is unique. Let this value be $m_{e}^{*}$. For all stages $s \\geq s_{e}^{*}$, the marker $m_{e,s}$ will be set to this same value $m_{e}^{*}$. This means the marker stabilizes. The marker $m_{e,s}$ can only change at stages $s  s_{e}^{*}$ when the value of $R_{e,s}$ changes. Since $R_{e,s}$ is a non-decreasing sequence of integers that converges, it can only change its value a finite number of times. Consequently, $m_{e,s}$ also changes only a finite number of times. Goal 2 is met.\n\nThe policy described in A successfully achieves both design goals.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The policy guarantees both infinitely many potential witnesses for each requirement and only finitely many mind changes under stabilized higher-priority restraints.**\n\nThe policy is defined as:\n-   $S_{e} = \\{\\langle e,k \\rangle : k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n-   At stage $s$, $m_{e,s}$ is the least element of $S_{e}$ that is greater than $s$.\n\n1.  **Infinite Witness Set**: As with policy A, $S_e$ is an infinite computable set. Goal 1 is met.\n\n2.  **Finite Mind Changes**: The rule for the marker is $m_{e,s} = \\min \\{x \\in S_{e} \\mid x  s\\}$. This rule completely ignores the restraints $R_{e,s}$ from higher-priority requirements. The value of the marker depends only on the stage number $s$.\n    As the stage number $s$ increases, the lower bound for the marker, $s$, increases without limit ($s \\to \\infty$).\n    Let the elements of $S_{e}$ in increasing order be $x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\dots$.\n    The marker $m_{e,s}$ will be some $x_j$. At stage $s' = x_j$, the rule requires the new marker $m_{e,s'}$ to be the least element of $S_e$ that is greater than $s'=x_j$. This will be $x_{j+1}$.\n    So, $m_{e,x_j} = x_{j+1} \\neq x_j$.\n    Since the stage number $s$ goes to infinity, it will eventually surpass any chosen marker $m_{e,s}$, forcing a change. The marker $m_{e,s}$ must therefore change infinitely many times. Goal 2 is not met.\n\nThe policy described in B fails to ensure finite mind changes.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The policy guarantees both infinitely many potential witnesses for each requirement and only finitely many mind changes under stabilized higher-priority restraints.**\n\nThe policy is defined as:\n-   $S_{e} = \\mathbb{N}$ for all $e$.\n-   At stage $s$, $m_{e,s}$ is the least $x  R_{e,s}$ that is not currently chosen as $m_{j,s}$ by any requirement $Q_{j}$ with $j \\neq e$.\n\n1.  **Infinite Witness Set**: $S_e=\\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite computable set. Goal 1 is met.\n\n2.  **Finite Mind Changes**: The rule is $m_{e,s} = \\min \\{x  R_{e,s} \\mid \\forall j \\neq e, x \\neq m_{j,s}\\}$.\n    The critical flaw in this policy is that the choice of marker $m_{e,s}$ for the higher-priority requirement $Q_{e}$ depends on the choices of markers $m_{j,s}$ for all other requirements, including those with lower priority ($j  e$). This violates the fundamental principle of a priority ordering, where higher-priority requirements should be immune to the actions of lower-priority ones.\n    Consider requirement $Q_{e}$. We assume $R_{e,s}$ stabilizes to $R_{e}$ for $s \\geq s_{e}^{*}$. For $s \\geq s_{e}^{*}$, the rule becomes $m_{e,s} = \\min \\{x  R_{e} \\mid \\forall j \\neq e, x \\neq m_{j,s}\\}$.\n    Now, consider a lower-priority requirement $Q_{j}$ with $j  e$. The behavior of its marker $m_{j,s}$ is not guaranteed to stabilize. It can be injured by the actions of any $Q_k$ with $kj$, including $Q_e$. Suppose $Q_j$ has a strategy that causes its marker to oscillate. For example, let $e=0$, so $R_{0,s}=0$ for all $s$. Suppose $Q_1$ is a requirement that, due to its own internal logic, sets its marker $m_{1,s}=1$ at even stages and $m_{1,s}=2$ at odd stages (and all other $m_{j,s}$ for $j  1$ are greater than $2$).\n    -   At an even stage $s$, the set of markers used by others is $\\{1, m_{2,s}, \\dots\\}$. $Q_0$ needs to pick the least $x0$ not in this set. This would be $m_{0,s}=2$.\n    -   At an odd stage $s+1$, the set of markers used by others is $\\{2, m_{2,s+1}, \\dots\\}$. $Q_0$ needs to pick the least $x0$ not in this set. This would be $m_{0,s+1}=1$.\n    The marker $m_{0,s}$ for the highest priority requirement oscillates and never stabilizes, even though its own higher-priority restraints are constant. This is a direct result of influence from a lower-priority requirement. Therefore, Goal 2 is not met.\n\nThe policy described in C fails because it allows lower-priority requirements to interfere with higher-priority ones.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The policy guarantees both infinitely many potential witnesses for each requirement and only finitely many mind changes under stabilized higher-priority restraints.**\n\nThe policy is defined as:\n-   For each $e$, fix a finite set $S_{e}$ of numbers reserved for $Q_{e}$.\n\n1.  **Infinite Witness Set**: The policy explicitly states that $S_e$ is a *finite* set. The first design goal requires that \"each $S_e$ is infinite\". This policy directly contradicts Goal 1. In practice, finite witness sets are insufficient for general priority constructions, as a requirement might need to test an unbounded number of potential witnesses before finding one that allows it to be satisfied. If all witnesses in the finite set fail, the requirement can never be satisfied.\n\nBecause the policy fails to meet the first goal by its very definition, it is not a valid policy, regardless of its performance on the second goal.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3048786"}]}
