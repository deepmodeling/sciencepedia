One of the most important properties is regularity. This exercise invites you to get your hands dirty with the concept of cofinality, which is the tool we use to determine if a cardinal is regular or singular. By calculating the cofinality for some familiar ordinals, you will build a concrete understanding of why cardinals like $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{\\omega}$ fail to be inaccessible, motivating the search for cardinals with stronger properties [@problem_id:3046115].", "problem": "Assume the background axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). An ordinal is a transitive set well-ordered by the membership relation. For an ordinal $\\alpha$, a subset $C \\subseteq \\alpha$ is called cofinal in $\\alpha$ if for every $\\beta < \\alpha$ there exists $\\gamma \\in C$ with $\\beta \\leq \\gamma$, equivalently $\\sup(C) = \\alpha$. The cofinality $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)$ is defined to be the least order type of a cofinal subset of $\\alpha$.

It is a standard exercise in axiomatic set theory, with all terms defined precisely. The problem is free of any logical contradictions, factual unsoundness, or ambiguity. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe cofinality of a limit ordinal $\\alpha$, denoted $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)$, is the smallest ordinal $\\lambda$ such that there exists a function $f: \\lambda \\to \\alpha$ which is cofinal, meaning $\\sup\\{f(\\xi) \\mid \\xi < \\lambda\\} = \\alpha$. The cofinality of any limit ordinal is always an infinite regular cardinal.\n\n1.  **Cofinality of $\\omega$**\n\nThe ordinal $\\omega$ is the first infinite ordinal, representing the order type of the set of natural numbers $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. An ordinal $\\beta$ is an element of $\\omega$ if and only if $\\beta$ is a finite ordinal.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound for $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega)$. Let $C \\subseteq \\omega$ be any finite subset. Since $C$ is a finite set of natural numbers, it is bounded above; there exists a maximum element $m = \\max(C)$. The ordinal $m+1$ is also in $\\omega$. However, there is no element $\\gamma \\in C$ such that $m+1 \\leq \\gamma$, because all elements of $C$ are less than or equal to $m$. Therefore, $C$ cannot be cofinal in $\\omega$. This demonstrates that any cofinal subset of $\\omega$ must be infinite. The order type of any cofinal subset must therefore be at least the smallest infinite ordinal, which is $\\omega$. Thus, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega) \\geq \\omega$.\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound. Consider the subset $C = \\omega$ itself. For any $\\beta < \\omega$, we can choose $\\gamma = \\beta \\in C$, and clearly $\\beta \\leq \\gamma$. Therefore, $C$ is cofinal in $\\omega$. The order type of $C = \\omega$ is $\\omega$. This implies that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega) \\leq \\omega$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega) = \\omega$.\n\nAn ordinal $\\alpha$ is defined as **regular** if $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha) = \\alpha$. Since $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega) = \\omega$, the ordinal $\\omega$ is regular.\n\n2.  **Cofinality of $\\omega_{1}$**\n\nThe ordinal $\\omega_{1}$ is the first uncountable ordinal. It is the set of all countable ordinals. Its cardinality is $|\\omega_{1}| = \\aleph_{1}$.\n\nThe set $\\omega_{1}$ itself is cofinal in $\\omega_{1}$ and has order type $\\omega_{1}$, so we immediately have an upper bound: $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{1}) \\leq \\omega_{1}$.\n\nNow, we must show that the cofinality cannot be smaller than $\\omega_{1}$. Let us assume for contradiction that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{1}) = \\lambda$ for some ordinal $\\lambda < \\omega_{1}$. By the definition of $\\omega_{1}$, any ordinal $\\lambda < \\omega_{1}$ is countable. This means there exists a cofinal subset $C \\subseteq \\omega_{1}$ with order type $\\lambda$. So, there is an order-preserving map $f: \\lambda \\to C$ and $C = \\{f(\\xi) \\mid \\xi < \\lambda\\}$.\n\nSince $\\lambda$ is a countable ordinal, the set $C$ is a countable set of ordinals. Each element of $C$ is an ordinal $\\gamma \\in \\omega_{1}$, which by definition means each $\\gamma$ is a countable ordinal. Thus, $C$ is a countable collection of countable ordinals.\n\nThe supremum of the set $C$ is the union of its elements: $\\sup(C) = \\bigcup_{\\gamma \\in C} \\gamma$. The Axiom of Choice implies that the union of a countable collection of countable sets is itself a countable set. Therefore, $\\sup(C)$ must be a countable ordinal.\n\nHowever, we assumed that $C$ is cofinal in $\\omega_{1}$, which means by definition that $\\sup(C) = \\omega_{1}$. This leads to the conclusion that $\\omega_{1}$ is a countable ordinal. This is a direct contradiction to the definition of $\\omega_{1}$ as the first *uncountable* ordinal.\n\nOur initial assumption must be false. Therefore, there can be no cofinal subset of $\\omega_{1}$ with an order type less than $\\omega_{1}$. We must have $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{1}) = \\omega_{1}$.\n\nAs $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{1}) = \\omega_{1}$, the ordinal $\\omega_{1}$ is regular. This is an instance of the general theorem, provable in ZFC, that all successor cardinals $\\aleph_{\\alpha+1}$ are regular (and $\\omega_{1}$ is the initial ordinal for $\\aleph_{1} = \\aleph_{0+1}$).\n\n3.  **Cofinality of $\\omega_{\\omega}$**\n\nThe ordinal $\\omega_{\\omega}$ is the initial ordinal of cardinality $\\aleph_{\\omega}$. It is defined as the supremum of the sequence of preceding initial ordinals: $\\omega_{\\omega} = \\sup\\{\\omega_{n} \\mid n < \\omega\\}$.\n\nTo find its cofinality, we first seek a cofinal subset to establish an upper bound. Let us consider the set $C = \\{\\omega_{n} \\mid n < \\omega\\}$.\n-   $C$ is a subset of $\\omega_{\\omega}$: For any $n < \\omega$, the cardinality of $\\omega_{n}$ is $|\\omega_{n}| = \\aleph_{n}$. Since $n < \\omega$, we have $\\aleph_{n} < \\aleph_{\\omega}$. As $\\omega_{\\omega}$ is the least ordinal of cardinality $\\aleph_{\\omega}$, any ordinal of smaller cardinality must be less than $\\omega_{\\omega}$. Thus, $\\omega_{n} < \\omega_{\\omega}$ for all $n < \\omega$, and so $C \\subseteq \\omega_{\\omega}$.\n-   $C$ is cofinal in $\\omega_{\\omega}$: Let $\\beta$ be an arbitrary ordinal such that $\\beta < \\omega_{\\omega}$. By the definition of $\\omega_{\\omega}$, the cardinality of $\\beta$ must be strictly less than $\\aleph_{\\omega}$, i.e., $|\\beta| < \\aleph_{\\omega}$. This implies that $|\\beta| = \\aleph_{k}$ for some cardinal $\\aleph_k$ where $k < \\omega$. The smallest ordinal with cardinality $\\aleph_{k+1}$ is $\\omega_{k+1}$. Since $|\\beta| = \\aleph_k < \\aleph_{k+1}$, it must be that $\\beta < \\omega_{k+1}$. Let $\\gamma = \\omega_{k+1}$. We have found an element $\\gamma \\in C$ such that $\\beta < \\gamma$, which implies $\\beta \\leq \\gamma$. Thus, $C$ is cofinal in $\\omega_{\\omega}$.\n\nNow, we determine the order type of $C$. The mapping $n \\mapsto \\omega_n$ is an order-isomorphism from $(\\omega, <)$ to $(C, <)$. Therefore, the order type of $C$ is $\\omega$. This establishes the upper bound $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{\\omega}) \\leq \\omega$.\n\nSince $\\omega$ is the smallest infinite cardinal, the only possibility for a smaller cofinality would be a finite one. Let us assume for contradiction that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{\\omega}) = m$ for some finite ordinal $m < \\omega$. This would imply the existence of a cofinal subset $D = \\{\\delta_{0}, \\delta_{1}, \\dots, \\delta_{m-1}\\}$ with $\\sup(D) = \\omega_{\\omega}$. However, the supremum of a finite set of ordinals is simply their maximum element. Let $\\delta_{\\max} = \\max(D)$. Then $\\sup(D) = \\delta_{\\max}$. Since each $\\delta_{i} \\in D$ is an element of $\\omega_{\\omega}$, it must be that $\\delta_{\\max} < \\omega_{\\omega}$. This leads to $\\sup(D) < \\omega_{\\omega}$, which contradicts the assumption that $D$ is cofinal. Therefore, the cofinality of $\\omega_{\\omega}$ cannot be finite.\n\nGiven that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{\\omega})$ must be an infinite cardinal and that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{\\omega}) \\leq \\omega$, we conclude that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{\\omega}) = \\omega$.\n\nAn ordinal $\\alpha$ is defined as **singular** if $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha) < \\alpha$. Here, we have $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{\\omega}) = \\omega$. Since $\\omega = \\omega_{0}$, it is clear that $\\omega < \\omega_{\\omega}$. Therefore, $\\omega_{\\omega}$ is a singular ordinal (and a singular cardinal).\n\nThese results highlight the concepts central to large cardinal theory. A (strongly) inaccessible cardinal is a regular uncountable limit cardinal.\n-   $\\omega$ is a regular limit cardinal, but it is not uncountable.\n-   $\\omega_{1}$ is a regular uncountable cardinal, but it is a successor cardinal ($\\omega_{1} = \\omega_{0+1}$), not a limit cardinal.\n-   $\\omega_{\\omega}$ is an uncountable limit cardinal, but it is singular, not regular.\nNone of these ordinals qualify as inaccessible, illustrating the restrictive nature of large cardinal properties.\n\nThe final triple is $(\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega), \\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{1}), \\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_{\\omega})) = (\\omega, \\omega_{1}, \\omega)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\\omega & \\omega_{1} & \\omega\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3046115"}, {"introduction": "An inaccessible cardinal must satisfy two crucial conditions: it must be regular and a strong limit.

All definitions are correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The question asks for a logical deduction based on the provided definitions. It investigates whether one property ($\\beth$-fixed point) implies another (inaccessibility). A definitive answer can be derived within ZFC. The problem is structured to have a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, mathematical, and free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine if a cardinal $\\lambda$ being a $\\beth$-fixed point ($\\lambda=\\beth_\\lambda$) implies that $\\lambda$ is inaccessible. Let's check the three conditions for inaccessibility for a $\\beth$-fixed point $\\lambda$.\n\n1.  **Uncountability:** The $\\beth$ sequence starts with $\\beth_0 = \\aleph_0$. The function $f(\\alpha)=\\beth_\\alpha$ is strictly increasing. Any fixed point $\\lambda = \\beth_\\lambda$ must be greater than or equal to the first value, $\\beth_0$. If $\\lambda=\\aleph_0$, we would need $\\beth_{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_0$. However, $\\beth_{\\aleph_0} = \\beth_\\omega = \\sup_{n<\\omega} \\beth_n$, and since $\\beth_1=2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0$, we have $\\beth_\\omega > \\aleph_0$. Thus, $\\aleph_0$ is not a fixed point. Any fixed point $\\lambda$ must be strictly greater than $\\aleph_0$, and therefore uncountable. This condition holds.\n\n2.  **Strong Limit Property:** Let $\\lambda$ be a $\\beth$-fixed point, so $\\lambda=\\beth_\\lambda$. We need to show that for any cardinal $\\mu < \\lambda$, $2^\\mu < \\lambda$.\n    Since $\\lambda = \\beth_\\lambda = \\sup_{\\alpha<\\lambda}\\beth_\\alpha$, for any cardinal $\\mu < \\lambda$, there must exist an ordinal $\\alpha < \\lambda$ such that $\\mu \\le \\beth_\\alpha$.\n    Then the power set of $\\mu$ satisfies $2^\\mu \\le 2^{\\beth_\\alpha}$. By definition of the $\\beth$ hierarchy, $2^{\\beth_\\alpha} = \\beth_{\\alpha+1}$.\n    Since $\\lambda$ is a fixed point of a normal function starting above $0$, it must be a limit ordinal. Therefore, if $\\alpha < \\lambda$, then $\\alpha+1 < \\lambda$.\n    As one of the elements in the sequence whose supremum is $\\beth_\\lambda$, we have $\\beth_{\\alpha+1} < \\sup_{\\beta<\\lambda} \\beth_\\beta = \\beth_\\lambda = \\lambda$.\n    Combining these steps, we get $2^\\mu \\le \\beth_{\\alpha+1} < \\lambda$. Thus, $\\lambda$ is a strong limit cardinal. This condition holds.\n\n3.  **Regularity:** We need to check if $\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)=\\lambda$. The existence of $\\beth$-fixed points is a theorem of ZFC, a consequence of the Fixed Point Lemma for normal functions. However, the existence of an inaccessible cardinal (which is uncountable, regular, and a strong limit) is not provable in ZFC. If being a $\\beth$-fixed point implied regularity, then it would imply inaccessibility (since we have shown properties 1 and 2 hold). This would mean the existence of inaccessible cardinals is provable in ZFC, a known falsehood. Therefore, being a $\\beth$-fixed point cannot be sufficient to guarantee regularity. There must exist $\\beth$-fixed points that are singular.\n\nA standard construction for a singular $\\beth$-fixed point is as follows. Let $f(\\alpha) = \\beth_\\alpha$. Start with an ordinal, say $\\gamma_0=0$. Define a sequence by iteration: $\\gamma_{n+1} = f(\\gamma_n) = \\beth_{\\gamma_n}$. The sequence is $\\gamma_0=0$, $\\gamma_1=\\beth_0=\\aleph_0$, $\\gamma_2=\\beth_{\\aleph_0}=\\beth_\\omega$, $\\gamma_3=\\beth_{\\beth_\\omega}$, and so on. Let $\\lambda = \\sup_{n<\\omega} \\gamma_n$.\n-   By the continuity of the normal function $f$, $f(\\lambda) = f(\\sup_{n<\\omega}\\gamma_n) = \\sup_{n<\\omega} f(\\gamma_n) = \\sup_{n<\\omega} \\gamma_{n+1} = \\lambda$. So $\\lambda$ is a $\\beth$-fixed point.\n-   By construction, $\\lambda$ is the limit of a sequence of length $\\omega$. Thus, $\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda) = \\omega$.\n-   Since $\\lambda > \\aleph_0 = \\omega$, $\\lambda$ is singular ($\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda) < \\lambda$) and thus not regular.\n\nThis construction yields a cardinal that is a $\\beth$-fixed point, uncountable, a strong limit, but singular. This cardinal is not inaccessible. This confirms that being a $\\beth$-fixed point is insufficient for inaccessibility precisely because regularity is not guaranteed.\n\n### OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. For any $\\beth$-fixed point $\\lambda$, since $f$ is increasing and continuous, one has $\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)=\\mathrm{cf}(f(\\lambda))=\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)$, which forces $\\lambda$ to be regular; hence every $\\beth$-fixed point is inaccessible.**\nThis option contains fallacious reasoning. For a fixed point $\\lambda$ of $f$, the statement $f(\\lambda)=\\lambda$ is true by definition. Thus, $\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)=\\mathrm{cf}(f(\\lambda))$ is just the tautology $\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)=\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)$. A tautology provides no new information and certainly does not \"force\" $\\lambda$ to be regular. As shown in the derivation above, singular $\\beth$-fixed points exist, so the conclusion is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Let $f(\\alpha)=\\beth_\\alpha$ and fix any ordinal $\\gamma$. Define $\\lambda=\\sup_{n<\\omega} f^{n}(\\gamma)$, where $f^{n}$ denotes the $n$-fold iterate of $f$. By normality, $f(\\lambda)=\\sup_{n<\\omega} f^{n+1}(\\gamma)=\\lambda$, so $\\lambda$ is a $\\beth$-fixed point. The sequence $\\langle f^{n}(\\gamma):n<\\omega\\rangle$ witnesses $\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)=\\omega$, so $\\lambda$ is singular. Moreover, for any $\\kappa<\\lambda$, there is $n<\\omega$ with $\\kappa<f^{n}(\\gamma)$, hence $2^\\kappa\\le 2^{f^{n}(\\gamma)}=f^{n+1}(\\gamma)<\\lambda$, so $\\lambda$ is a strong limit. Thus $\\lambda$ is a singular strong limit $\\beth$-fixed point and not inaccessible, showing regularity is essential.**\nThis option presents the standard construction of a singular fixed point for a normal function.\n-   The construction $\\lambda=\\sup_{n<\\omega} f^{n}(\\gamma)$ and the proof that this $\\lambda$ is a fixed point ($f(\\lambda)=\\lambda$) are correct.\n-   The conclusion that the cofinality is $\\omega$ ($\\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)=\\omega$) is correct, which correctly implies $\\lambda$ is singular.\n-   The conclusion that $\\lambda$ is a strong limit is correct, as all $\\beth$-fixed points are strong limits.\n-   The final conclusion that $\\lambda$ is a singular strong limit $\\beth$-fixed point and serves as a counterexample to the claim that $\\beth$-fixed points are inaccessible is correct.\nThere is a flaw in the provided justification for the strong limit property. The equality $2^{f^{n}(\\gamma)}=f^{n+1}(\\gamma)$ is not generally true. Let $\\mu = f^n(\\gamma)$. The equality states $2^\\mu = \\beth_\\mu$, which is false in general (e.g., for $\\mu=\\aleph_0$, $2^{\\aleph_0}=\\beth_1$, but $\\beth_{\\aleph_0}=\\beth_\\omega$). Despite this error in a subordinate clause, the option's primary claims are all correct: the counterexample template is valid and correctly shown to be a singular $\\beth$-fixed point, which is the core of the required explanation. The overall argument correctly identifies the failure of regularity as the key point.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Taking $\\lambda=\\beth_\\omega$ yields a $\\beth$-fixed point of cofinality $\\omega$, and since limits of the $\\beth$-sequence are always regular, $\\lambda$ is inaccessible; this shows $\\beth$-fixed points suffice for inaccessibility even without assuming regularity.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, $\\lambda=\\beth_\\omega$ is not a $\\beth$-fixed point; this would require $\\beth_{\\beth_\\omega} = \\beth_\\omega$, which is not an identity. Second, $\\beth_\\omega$ does have cofinality $\\omega$ ($\\mathrm{cf}(\\beth_\\omega)=\\omega$) because $\\beth_\\omega = \\sup_{n<\\omega} \\beth_n$, so it is singular. The claim that \"limits of the $\\beth$-sequence are always regular\" is directly contradicted by this fact. The entire line of reasoning is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), every $\\beth$-fixed point is both a strong limit and regular; therefore, in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) plus GCH, being a $\\beth$-fixed point is sufficient for inaccessibility.**\nUnder GCH, we have $\\beth_\\alpha = \\aleph_\\alpha$ for all $\\alpha$. A $\\beth$-fixed point $\\lambda=\\beth_\\lambda$ is also an $\\aleph$-fixed point, $\\lambda=\\aleph_\\lambda$. As shown in our main derivation, $\\beth$-fixed points are always strong limits, with or without GCH. However, the claim that they are always regular under GCH is false. The cardinal $\\lambda = \\sup\\{\\aleph_0, \\aleph_{\\aleph_0}, \\aleph_{\\aleph_{\\aleph_0}}, \\dots\\}$ is an $\\aleph$-fixed point, and thus a $\\beth$-fixed point under GCH, but it has cofinality $\\omega$ and is therefore singular. The premise is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), there are no singular $\\beth$-fixed points, so the only obstruction to inaccessibility for $\\beth$-fixed points is measurability rather than regularity.**\nThis statement is false. As demonstrated by the construction in option B and our main derivation, the existence of singular $\\beth$-fixed points is provable in ZFC. Therefore, the failure of regularity is a known obstruction to inaccessibility for $\\beth$-fixed points. The reference to measurability is a red herring; measurability is a much stronger property than inaccessibility, not a weaker property that serves as the \"only obstruction\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2976020"}, {"introduction": "The definitions of large cardinals are not monolithic; they often come in 'weak' and 'strong' versions that coincide under certain assumptions, like the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).

This is equivalent to: for all cardinals $\\lambda < \\kappa$, $\\lambda^+ < \\kappa$.\n-   A cardinal $\\kappa$ is a **strong limit cardinal** if for all cardinals $\\lambda < \\kappa$, $2^\\lambda < \\kappa$.\n-   An uncountable cardinal $\\kappa$ is **strongly inaccessible** if it is regular and a strong limit cardinal.\n-   The problem asks to identify a correct example, at the level of relative consistency, of a model of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ in which weakly inaccessible cardinals exist but strongly inaccessible cardinals do not.\n-   The reasoning should use these definitions and standard results like the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis ($\\mathsf{GCH}$) and Easton's theorem on controlling the continuum function ($2^\\lambda$) via forcing.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is well-defined within the field of mathematical logic, specifically axiomatic set theory.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based entirely on standard, rigorously defined concepts in ZFC set theory (cardinality, regularity, cofinality, forcing, large cardinals). The definitions provided are the correct, accepted definitions in the field.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem asks to evaluate several statements concerning the relative consistency of the existence of certain types of cardinals. This is a standard type of question in set theory, and a unique answer among the options is expected. The question is precise.\n-   **Objective**: The language is formal and objective. It relies on mathematical definitions and established theorems, with no subjective content.\n\nAll the terms used are standard in advanced set theory. The problem is a valid, well-posed question in mathematical logic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between weakly and strongly inaccessible cardinals. A cardinal $\\kappa$ is strongly inaccessible if it is uncountable, regular, and a strong limit. A cardinal $\\kappa$ is weakly inaccessible if it is uncountable, regular, and a limit cardinal.\n\nEvery strong limit cardinal is a limit cardinal. To see this, let $\\kappa$ be a strong limit cardinal. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\kappa$ is a successor cardinal, so $\\kappa = \\lambda^+$ for some cardinal $\\lambda$. Then $\\lambda < \\kappa$. By the definition of a strong limit, this implies $2^\\lambda < \\kappa$. However, by Cantor's theorem, we know that $\\lambda^+ \\le 2^\\lambda$. This leads to the contradiction $\\kappa = \\lambda^+ \\le 2^\\lambda < \\kappa$. Therefore, $\\kappa$ must be a limit cardinal.\n\nThis shows that every strongly inaccessible cardinal is also a weakly inaccessible cardinal. The problem asks for a model where the converse is not true, and in fact, where no strongly inaccessible cardinals exist at all, but at least one weakly inaccessible cardinal does. A weakly inaccessible cardinal $\\kappa$ fails to be strongly inaccessible if and only if it is not a strong limit cardinal. This means there must exist some cardinal $\\lambda < \\kappa$ such that $2^\\lambda \\ge \\kappa$.\n\nThe Generalized Continuum Hypothesis ($\\mathsf{GCH}$) states that for every infinite cardinal $\\lambda$, $2^\\lambda = \\lambda^+$. If $\\mathsf{GCH}$ holds and $\\kappa$ is a weakly inaccessible cardinal, then for any $\\lambda < \\kappa$, we have $2^\\lambda = \\lambda^+$. Since $\\kappa$ is a limit cardinal, $\\lambda^+ < \\kappa$. Thus, for all $\\lambda < \\kappa$, $2^\\lambda < \\kappa$, which means $\\kappa$ is a strong limit cardinal. Consequently, under $\\mathsf{GCH}$, any weakly inaccessible cardinal is also strongly inaccessible. To separate these two notions, we must be in a model where $\\mathsf{GCH}$ fails.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. In the constructible universe $L$, there are weakly inaccessible cardinals but no strongly inaccessible cardinals.**\n\nThe constructible universe $L$ is an inner model of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ in which the Axiom of Constructibility ($V=L$) holds. A fundamental theorem of set theory states that $\\mathsf{GCH}$ is true in $L$. As we have just shown, if $\\mathsf{GCH}$ holds, then any weakly inaccessible cardinal is also a strongly inaccessible cardinal. Therefore, in $L$, the set of weakly inaccessible cardinals is identical to the set of strongly inaccessible cardinals. The statement that there are weakly inaccessible but no strongly inaccessible cardinals in $L$ is logically impossible.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. If $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ is consistent, then $\\mathsf{ZFC}+$“there is a weakly inaccessible cardinal but there are no strongly inaccessible cardinals” is consistent.**\n\nThe existence of any inaccessible cardinal (weakly or strongly) cannot be proven from the axioms of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ alone, assuming $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ is consistent. If $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ could prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal $\\kappa$, then the set $V_\\kappa$ (the collection of sets with rank less than $\\kappa$) would form a set model of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$. The existence of a set model implies the consistency of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$. By Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, a consistent theory like $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ cannot prove its own consistency. Therefore, $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ cannot prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal. This means that the consistency of \"$\\mathsf{ZFC}$ + there is an inaccessible cardinal\" is a strictly stronger hypothesis than the consistency of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ alone. The antecedent of the implication, `If $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ is consistent`, is too weak to establish the consistency of the existence of any form of inaccessible cardinal.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Assuming the consistency of $\\mathsf{ZFC}+$“there is exactly one strongly inaccessible cardinal $\\kappa$ and $\\mathsf{GCH}$ holds,” there is a forcing extension preserving cardinals and cofinalities in which $2^{\\lambda}\\ge\\kappa^{+}$ for some regular $\\lambda<\\kappa$, so that in the extension $\\kappa$ is weakly inaccessible but not strongly inaccessible, and there are no strongly inaccessible cardinals.**\n\nThis option describes a standard construction using the method of forcing. Let us analyze it step by step.\n1.  **Assumption:** We start with the assumption that $\\operatorname{Con}(\\mathsf{ZFC} + \\text{\"there is exactly one strongly inaccessible cardinal } \\kappa \\text{ and } \\mathsf{GCH} \\text{ holds\"})$. This is a reasonable starting point for a relative consistency proof. Let $M$ be a model satisfying this theory.\n2.  **Goal:** Construct a forcing extension $M[G]$ where $\\kappa$ is weakly inaccessible but not strongly inaccessible, and no other cardinal is strongly inaccessible.\n3.  **Construction:** In $M$, since $\\mathsf{GCH}$ holds, $\\kappa$ is both weakly and strongly inaccessible. To make $\\kappa$ not strongly inaccessible, we need to violate the strong limit condition at $\\kappa$. This means we need to force the existence of a cardinal $\\lambda < \\kappa$ such that in the extension, $2^\\lambda \\ge \\kappa$. Easton's theorem provides a general method for changing the values of the continuum function $2^\\mu$ at regular cardinals $\\mu$ while preserving cardinals and cofinalities. We can define a function $F$ on the regular cardinals in $M$ that we wish to be the new continuum function. For instance, pick a regular cardinal $\\lambda$ in $M$ such that $\\aleph_0 < \\lambda < \\kappa$ (such a $\\lambda$ exists because $\\kappa$ is a limit cardinal, e.g., $\\lambda=\\aleph_1$). Let's define $F(\\lambda) = \\kappa^+$ and for all other regular cardinals $\\mu$, $F(\\mu) = \\mu^+$ (this can be made monotonic, e.g., $F(\\mu)=\\kappa^+$ for all $\\lambda \\leq \\mu < \\kappa$). Such a function $F$ satisfies the conditions of Easton's theorem (monotonicity and $\\operatorname{cf}(F(\\mu)) > \\mu$). Therefore, there exists a forcing extension $M[G]$ that preserves all cardinals and cofinalities of $M$, and in which $2^\\mu = F(\\mu)$ for all regular $\\mu$ from $M$ (with some caveats for cardinals above $\\kappa$ which are not relevant here).\n4.  **Verification:**\n    -   In $M[G]$, since cardinals and cofinalities are preserved, $\\kappa$ remains a regular cardinal and a limit cardinal. Thus, $\\kappa$ is weakly inaccessible in $M[G]$.\n    -   In $M[G]$, by construction, $2^\\lambda \\ge \\kappa^+ > \\kappa$ for some $\\lambda < \\kappa$. Therefore, $\\kappa$ is not a strong limit cardinal in $M[G]$ and hence not strongly inaccessible.\n    -   Are there any strongly inaccessible cardinals in $M[G]$? The only candidate from $M$ was $\\kappa$, which we have just shown is no longer strongly inaccessible. For any other cardinal $\\mu$ to become strongly inaccessible in $M[G]$, it must have been weakly inaccessible in $M$ (since these properties are preserved). But we assumed $\\kappa$ was the *only* inaccessible in $M$. Therefore, no other cardinal can be strongly inaccessible in $M[G]$.\nThe construction outlined in the option is valid and correctly applies Easton's theorem as mentioned in the problem prompt.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In any model of $\\mathsf{ZFC}+\\mathsf{GCH}$ with at least one uncountable regular cardinal, that cardinal is weakly but not strongly inaccessible.**\n\nThis statement is false. Consider the cardinal $\\aleph_1$. In any model of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$, $\\aleph_1$ is an uncountable regular cardinal. However, $\\aleph_1$ is the successor of $\\aleph_0$ ($\\aleph_1 = \\aleph_0^+$), so it is not a limit cardinal. Therefore, $\\aleph_1$ is not weakly inaccessible. The statement claims that *any* such cardinal is weakly inaccessible, which is a plain contradiction with the properties of successor cardinals.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If there exists a measurable cardinal, then without any forcing there is a model of $\\mathsf{ZFC}$ that has weakly inaccessible cardinals but no strongly inaccessible cardinals.**\n\nThe existence of a measurable cardinal is a much stronger assumption than the existence of an inaccessible one. If a measurable cardinal $\\kappa$ exists, then $\\kappa$ is strongly inaccessible. This means that the universe $V$ itself is not the desired model. The statement claims the existence of a model \"without any forcing\". This is typically interpreted to mean an inner model, such as $L$ or HOD (the class of hereditarily ordinal definable sets).\n-   In $L$, as argued for option A, weak inaccessibility is equivalent to strong inaccessibility. So $L$ is not the required model.\n-   The consistency of \"weakly inaccessible but not strongly inaccessible\" can be proven from the consistency of \"strongly inaccessible\". The existence of a measurable cardinal implies the consistency of a strongly inaccessible cardinal. Thus, the existence of a measurable implies the consistency of the desired theory. However, the statement in E is an implication within $\\mathsf{ZFC}$, not a meta-mathematical statement about consistency. It claims that the mere existence of a measurable cardinal guarantees the existence of such a model. While this is true via a model-theoretic argument (the proof of consistency can be formalized in $\\mathsf{ZFC}$, and by the Completeness Theorem, this implies existence of a model), the clause \"without any forcing\" is problematic. The standard proof that separates weak and strong inaccessibility *uses* forcing. To obtain such a model \"without forcing\" from a measurable would require a sophisticated inner model construction that is not standard, and it is questionable if it is even possible. In contrast, option C describes the exact (forcing-based) method that is the canonical way to establish this result. The phrasing in E makes it highly dubious, especially compared to the textbook correctness of C.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "3046086"}]}
