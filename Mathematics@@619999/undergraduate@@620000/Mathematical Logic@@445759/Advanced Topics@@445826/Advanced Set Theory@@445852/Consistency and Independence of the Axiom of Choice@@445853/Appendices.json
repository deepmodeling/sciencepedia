Finite choice states that if $I$ is finite and each $A_i$ is nonempty, then there is a choice function; this is provable in $ZF$ by induction on $|I|$. Countable choice ($AC_{\\omega}$) asserts the same for $I=\\mathbb{N}$ and is independent of $ZF$. A valid example is: a countable family $(A_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ where each $A_n$ is a two-element subset of $\\mathbb{R}$; in some models of $ZF$ there is no function $f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ with $f(n)\\in A_n$ for all $n$, although for every finite subfamily a choice function exists by finite induction in $ZF$.\n\nB. Finite choice can fail in $ZF$ because induction does not apply to arbitrary finite families, whereas $AC_{\\omega}$ is equivalent to $AC$. An example is the family $\\{ \\{0,1\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\dots\\}$; without $AC$ there need not be any function selecting one element from each of these pairs.\n\nC.

An example of possible failure of countable choice is the family $\\bigl\\{\\{n,n+1\\}:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\bigr\\}$, which may lack a choice function in $ZF$.\n\nD. Finite choice guarantees a choice function for every finite subfamily, but $AC_{\\omega}$ holds outright in $ZF$ whenever all the sets in the family are isomorphic. For instance, for the countable family $\\{X_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ with each $X_n=X$ for some fixed nonempty set $X$, there need not be a choice function unless $AC$ holds, so this gives a family where countable choice may fail even though finite choice holds.", "solution": "The problem asks us to distinguish between finite choice and countable choice within the axiomatic system of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF).\n\n1.  **Finite Choice is a Theorem of ZF:** For any finite family of non-empty sets, $\\{A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k\\}$, a choice function can be constructed in ZF using finite induction.\n    *   **Base case (k=1):** For a single non-empty set $A_1$, the existence of an element $x_1 \\in A_1$ is given by definition. The function $f = \\{(1, x_1)\\}$ is a choice function.\n    *   **Inductive step:** Assuming a choice function exists for a family of size $k$, we can extend it to a family of size $k+1$.

This step-by-step construction is formalizable in ZF.\n\n2.  **Countable Choice is Independent of ZF:** For a countably infinite family $\\{A_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, the inductive argument above does not work. It would require making infinitely many choices, which cannot be justified by the axioms of ZF alone. ZF can prove that for every *n*, a choice function exists for the first *n* sets, but it cannot prove the existence of a single function that works for all sets in the infinite sequence simultaneously.

It correctly states that finite choice is provable in ZF by induction, while countable choice ($AC_{\\omega}$) is independent. It also provides the classic example used to show the failure of $AC_{\\omega}$: a countable family of 2-element sets. In certain models of ZF (symmetric models), it is impossible to construct a choice function for such a family if there is no rule to distinguish the elements in each pair uniformly.\n\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect. It falsely claims that finite choice can fail in ZF and that $AC_{\\omega}$ is equivalent to AC (it is strictly weaker). The example family it gives, $\\{\\{2n, 2n+1\\}\\}$, has a ZF-definable choice function (e.g., choose the smaller element from each pair).\n\n*   **C:** This option is incorrect. It wrongly equates finite choice with the well-ordering theorem (which is equivalent to the full AC) and incorrectly states that $AC_{\\omega}$ implies AC (the reverse is true). The example is again flawed as it allows a definable choice.\n\n*   **D:** This option is incorrect. It correctly states finite choice is provable, but then makes two errors. First, it incorrectly claims $AC_{\\omega}$ holds in ZF for isomorphic sets; the standard counterexample uses sets of the same cardinality (size 2). Second, it provides a flawed example of a constant family $\\{X_n=X\\}$, which has a ZF-definable choice function (just pick one element from $X$ and choose it every time).\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct conceptual distinction and a valid example.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3038981"}, {"introduction": "A powerful consequence of the Axiom of Choice is its ability to extend a partial solution to a global one.

We can prove this directly.\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be a family of nonempty sets and let $s$ be a partial choice function with domain $\\mathcal{D} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{G} = \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{D}$ be the subfamily of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$ that are not in the domain of $s$. Every set in $\\mathcal{G}$ is an element of $\\mathcal{F}$, so it is nonempty.\nBy the Axiom of Choice (AC), there exists a choice function for the family $\\mathcal{G}$. Let us call this function $c_{\\mathcal{G}}$. The function $c_{\\mathcal{G}}$ has domain $\\mathcal{G}$ and for every $X \\in \\mathcal{G}$, $c_{\\mathcal{G}}(X) \\in X$.\nNow, we can define a function $c$ with domain $\\mathcal{F}$ as follows:\n$$ c(X) = \\begin{cases} s(X) & \\text{if } X \\in \\mathcal{D} \\\\ c_{\\mathcal{G}}(X) & \\text{if } X \\in \\mathcal{G} \\end{cases} $$\nThe domain of $c$ is $\\mathcal{D} \\cup \\mathcal{G} = \\mathcal{D} \\cup (\\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{D}) = \\mathcal{F}$.\nWe must verify that $c$ is a choice function for $\\mathcal{F}$.\nFor any $X \\in \\mathcal{F}$:\n1.  If $X \\in \\mathcal{D}$, then $c(X) = s(X)$. Since $s$ is a partial choice function on $\\mathcal{D}$, we have $s(X) \\in X$.\n2.  If $X \\in \\mathcal{G}$, then $c(X) = c_{\\mathcal{G}}(X)$. Since $c_{\\mathcal{G}}$ is a choice function for $\\mathcal{G}$, we have $c_{\\mathcal{G}}(X) \\in X$.\nIn both cases, $c(X) \\in X$. Thus, $c$ is a full choice function on $\\mathcal{F}$.\nBy its definition, for any $X \\in \\mathcal{D}$, $c(X) = s(X)$, which means that $c$ is an extension of $s$. That is, $c\\!\\restriction\\!\\mathcal{D} = s$.\nThe proof is valid in ZFC.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Analysis of Option B\n\n**Statement B:** In ZF alone, it is consistent that there exists a countable family $\\mathcal{A} = \\{A_{n} : n \\in \\omega\\}$ of $2$-element sets with no choice function. Consequently, in such a model, a partial choice function defined on a finite subfamily cannot be extended to a full choice function on $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement consists of two parts.\nFirst part: \"In ZF alone, it is consistent that there exists a countable family $\\mathcal{A} = \\{A_{n} : n \\in \\omega\\}$ of $2$-element sets with no choice function.\" This is a famous result in set theory, first established by Fraenkel and later demonstrated with modern techniques (forcing) by Cohen. It shows that if ZF is consistent, then ZF + \"There exists a countable family of pairs without a choice function\" is also consistent. Therefore, the failure of the Axiom of Countable Choice for families of $2$-element sets cannot be disproven in ZF. This part of the statement is correct.\n\nSecond part: \"Consequently, in such a model, a partial choice function defined on a finite subfamily cannot be extended to a full choice function on $\\mathcal{A}$.\" Let's analyze this in a model of ZF where such a family $\\mathcal{A}$ exists. Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be any finite subfamily of $\\mathcal{A}$. In ZF, one can prove that any finite family of nonempty sets has a choice function (by finite induction). So, a partial choice function $s$ on $\\mathcal{D}$ always exists. The empty function (on the empty subfamily) is also a partial choice function.\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that a partial choice function $s$ on a finite subfamily $\\mathcal{D} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}$ could be extended to a full choice function $c$ on $\\mathcal{A}$. By definition, a full choice function on $\\mathcal{A}$ is a function $c$ with domain $\\mathcal{A}$ such that for all $X \\in \\mathcal{A}$, $c(X) \\in X$. This function $c$ would be, precisely, a choice function for the family $\\mathcal{A}$.\nHowever, we are working in a model where, by hypothesis, the family $\\mathcal{A}$ has no choice function. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the assumption that an extension exists must be false. This holds for any partial choice function on any finite subfamily, including the empty one. The logic is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Analysis of Option C\n\n**Statement C:** In ZF alone, for every family $\\mathcal{F}$ of finite nonempty sets, any partial choice function on $\\mathcal{F}$ can be extended to a full choice function by recursion on $\\omega$.\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement claims that the Axiom of Choice for families of finite sets (often denoted AC$_{\\text{fin}}$) is a theorem of ZF. This is known to be false.\nThe phrase \"by recursion on $\\omega$\" suggests a procedure for countable families. If the family $\\mathcal{F}$ is countable, say $\\mathcal{F} = \\{F_n : n \\in \\omega\\}$, the claim is that we can construct a choice function. This is precisely the Axiom of Countable Choice. The statement here is even more specific: for families of *finite* sets.\nThe consistency result mentioned in option B provides a direct counterexample. In a model of ZF where there exists a countable family $\\mathcal{A} = \\{A_n : n \\in \\omega\\}$ of $2$-element sets with no choice function, $\\mathcal{A}$ is a family of finite nonempty sets. Consider the empty partial choice function $s$ (i.e., its domain $\\mathcal{D}$ is the empty set). According to statement C, this function $s$ could be extended to a full choice function on $\\mathcal{A}$. Such an extension would be a choice function for $\\mathcal{A}$. But in this model, no such choice function exists.\nTherefore, the statement is false. It is not provable in ZF.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Analysis of Option D\n\n**Statement D:** In ZF alone, given any family $\\mathcal{F}$ of nonempty sets and any partial choice function $s$ on $\\mathcal{F}$, there is always a maximal extension to a full choice function by an application of Zorn’s Lemma.\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement is logically flawed. Zorn's Lemma is an axiom equivalent to the Axiom of Choice (in the context of ZF). Therefore, one cannot use Zorn's Lemma \"in ZF alone.\" If Zorn's Lemma is assumed, the axiomatic system is ZFC, not ZF.\nThe statement seems to claim that a certain result (existence of a maximal extension which is a full choice function) is provable in ZF, and the method of proof is Zorn's Lemma. This is a contradiction. The method is unavailable in the specified system.\nLet's analyze the underlying claim: the existence of a maximal partial choice function implies the existence of a full choice function. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the set of all partial choice functions extending $s$, ordered by function extension. Every chain in $\\mathcal{P}$ has an upper bound (the union of the functions in the chain). By Zorn's Lemma, $\\mathcal{P}$ has a maximal element, say $m$. If the domain of $m$ is not all of $\\mathcal{F}$, we can pick a set $X \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathrm{dom}(m)$, pick an element $x \\in X$, and form a new partial choice function $m \\cup \\{(X,x)\\}$, which properly extends $m$. This contradicts maximality. Thus, the domain of $m$ must be $\\mathcal{F}$, and $m$ is a full choice function extending $s$.\nThis entire argument relies on Zorn's Lemma. Since Zorn's Lemma is not provable in ZF, the conclusion is not provable in ZF. The statement is essentially a convoluted way of asserting that AC is a theorem of ZF, which is false.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Analysis of Option E\n\n**Statement E:** In ZF together with AC, one can extend a partial choice function $s$ on $\\mathcal{D} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$ to a full choice function on $\\mathcal{F}$ by replacing each $X \\in \\mathcal{D}$ with the singleton $\\{s(X)\\}$ and then applying AC to the modified family; any choice from a singleton is forced to be its unique member, so the extension agrees with $s$ on $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement proposes a specific construction for extending a partial choice function in ZFC. Let's verify the steps.\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be a family of nonempty sets, and $s$ a partial choice function on $\\mathcal{D} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$.\nDefine a new family of sets $\\mathcal{F}'$ indexed by $\\mathcal{F}$. For each $X \\in \\mathcal{F}$, define a set $Y_X$ as follows:\n$$ Y_X = \\begin{cases} \\{s(X)\\} & \\text{if } X \\in \\mathcal{D} \\\\ X & \\text{if } X \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{D} \\end{cases} $$\nLet $\\mathcal{F}' = \\{Y_X \\mid X \\in \\mathcal{F}\\}$.\nEvery set in this new family $\\mathcal{F}'$ is nonempty. If $X \\in \\mathcal{D}$, $Y_X = \\{s(X)\\}$ is a singleton, hence nonempty. If $X \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{D}$, $Y_X = X$, which is nonempty by the initial problem setup.\nNow, we apply the Axiom of Choice to the family $\\mathcal{F}'$. This guarantees the existence of a choice function $c'$ for $\\mathcal{F}'$. This means $c'$ is a function with domain $\\mathcal{F}'$ such that for every $Y \\in \\mathcal{F}'$, $c'(Y) \\in Y$.\nWe now define the desired full choice function $c$ on $\\mathcal{F}$. For each $X \\in \\mathcal{F}$, let $c(X) = c'(Y_X)$.\nLet's check if $c$ is a valid choice function on $\\mathcal{F}$ that extends $s$.\n1.  The domain of $c$ is $\\mathcal{F}$.\n2.  For any $X \\in \\mathcal{F}$, we must show $c(X) \\in X$.\n    - If $X \\in \\mathcal{D}$, then $Y_X = \\{s(X)\\}$. Since $c'$ is a choice function for $\\mathcal{F}'$, $c'(Y_X)$ must be an element of $Y_X$. The only element is $s(X)$, so $c'(Y_X) = s(X)$. Thus, $c(X) = s(X)$. Since $s$ is a partial choice function, $s(X) \\in X$.\n    - If $X \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{D}$, then $Y_X = X$. We have $c(X) = c'(Y_X) = c'(X)$. Since $c'$ is a choice function for $\\mathcal{F}'$, $c'(X) \\in X$.\nIn all cases, $c(X) \\in X$. So $c$ is a full choice function on $\\mathcal{F}$.\n3.  We must check if $c$ extends $s$. For any $X \\in \\mathcal{D}$, we showed that $c(X) = s(X)$. Thus, $c\\!\\restriction\\!\\mathcal{D} = s$.\nThe procedure described is a valid proof in ZFC.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "3038997"}, {"introduction": "To prove that the Axiom of Choice is independent of $ZF$, it is not enough to simply fail to prove it; one must construct a mathematical universe—a model of $ZF$—where $AC$ is demonstrably false.

Moreover, the whole family $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}=\\{\\dot{A}_n:n\\in\\omega\\}$ is hereditarily symmetric because for any finite $E\\subseteq\\omega\\times 2$, the subgroup $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)$ fixes $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}$ setwise and pointwise fixes each $\\dot{A}_n$ for $n$ with $\\{(n,0),(n,1)\\}\\subseteq E$, and invariance under the group action suffices for symmetry of the name collecting all $\\dot{A}_n$.\n\nNow suppose toward a contradiction that there is a hereditarily symmetric name $\\dot{f}$ and a condition $p\\in\\mathbb{P}$ such that\n$$\np\\Vdash \\text{“} \\dot{f}\\text{ is a function with domain } \\check{\\omega} \\text{ and } \\forall n\\in\\check{\\omega},\\, \\dot{f}(\\check{n})\\in \\dot{A}_n \\text{.”}\n$$\nBy definition of symmetry, there is a finite $E\\subseteq \\omega\\times 2$ with $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)\\in\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\operatorname{Fix}(E)\\leq \\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})$. Let $F=\\{n\\in\\omega:\\ (n,0)\\in E\\ \\text{or}\\ (n,1)\\in E\\}$, which is finite. Choose $m\\in \\omega\\setminus F$. Consider the automorphism $\\pi\\in\\mathcal{G}$ given by $\\sigma=\\operatorname{id}_\\omega$ and $\\varepsilon(m)=1$, $\\varepsilon(n)=0$ for $n\\neq m$, i.e., $\\pi$ flips exactly the two coordinates $(m,0)$ and $(m,1)$. Then $\\pi\\in \\operatorname{Fix}(E)$, hence $\\pi\\in \\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})$ and $\\pi p$ and $p$ are compatible (indeed equal since the support of $p$ is finite and we can choose $m$ to be outside it as well). Using the standard automorphism lemma (if $p\\Vdash \\varphi(\\dot{x})$ then $\\pi p\\Vdash \\varphi(\\pi\\dot{x})$), from\n$$\np\\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{m})\\in \\{\\dot{c}_{m,0},\\dot{c}_{m,1}\\}\n$$\nwe get\n$$\n\\pi p \\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{m})=\\pi\\dot{f}(\\check{m})\\in \\{\\pi\\dot{c}_{m,0},\\pi\\dot{c}_{m,1}\\}=\\{\\dot{c}_{m,1},\\dot{c}_{m,0}\\}.\n$$\nBecause $p$ and $\\pi p$ are compatible and $\\dot{f}$ is fixed by $\\pi$, it follows that no condition can force a definite value for $\\dot{f}(\\check{m})$, contradicting that $p$ forces $\\dot{f}$ to be a function. More formally, if some extension decided $\\dot{f}(\\check{m})=\\dot{c}_{m,0}$, applying $\\pi$ would decide it as $\\dot{c}_{m,1}$, contradicting the uniqueness of values of a function. Therefore, there is no hereditarily symmetric name for a choice function on $\\dot{\\mathcal{A}}$, and in the symmetric submodel $N$ the family $\\mathcal{A}$ has no choice function. Thus A is Correct.\n\nOption B. The forcing $\\mathbb{P}$ is the same as in A, but the group $\\mathcal{G}$ now consists only of permutations of the first coordinate, i.e., maps of the form $(n,i)\\mapsto (\\sigma(n),i)$ with no flips $i\\mapsto 1-i$ allowed. The filter $\\mathcal{F}$ is generated by pointwise stabilizers of finite subsets of $\\omega$. In this setting, define a name $\\dot{f}$ by\n$$\n\\dot{f}=\\{\\, (1_{\\mathbb{P}}, \\langle \\check{n}, \\dot{c}_{n,0}\\rangle ) : n\\in\\omega \\,\\},\n$$\nso that $1_{\\mathbb{P}}\\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{n})=\\dot{c}_{n,0}$ for all $n$. This name is fixed by any permutation of $\\omega$ because each coordinate choice is made uniformly by the rule “choose the element at second coordinate $0$,” which is invariant under reindexing of $n$. Therefore $\\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})=\\mathcal{G}$, and in particular $\\operatorname{sym}(\\dot{f})\\in\\mathcal{F}$. Hence $\\dot{f}$ is hereditarily symmetric and yields in the symmetric submodel $N$ a bona fide choice function on $\\mathcal{A}$. Consequently, the option’s claim that no choice function exists fails. Thus B is Incorrect.\n\nOption C. Here $N=V[G]$ is the full generic extension. Since $V\\models\\mathrm{ZFC}$ and forcing preserves the Axiom of Choice (the full generic extension by a set forcing still satisfies $\\mathrm{ZFC}$), we have $V[G]\\models\\mathrm{ZFC}$. In particular, every family of nonempty sets, including $\\mathcal{A}=\\{\\{c_{n,0},c_{n,1}\\}:n\\in\\omega\\}$, has a choice function in $V[G]$. Therefore, the claim that $\\mathcal{A}$ has no choice function is false. Thus C is Incorrect.\n\nOption D. The forcing $\\mathbb{P}$ and group $\\mathcal{G}$ are as in A, but the filter $\\mathcal{F}$ is generated by pointwise stabilizers of countable sets $E\\subseteq \\omega\\times 2$. Note that $\\operatorname{Fix}(\\omega\\times 2)=\\{\\operatorname{id}\\}$ is the trivial subgroup, and since $\\omega\\times 2$ is countable, $\\operatorname{Fix}(\\omega\\times 2)$ is one of the generators of $\\mathcal{F}$. Hence the trivial subgroup lies in $\\mathcal{F}$, and by upward closure of filters, every subgroup of $\\mathcal{G}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$. Consequently, every name is symmetric (its symmetry group contains the trivial subgroup), and every name is hereditarily symmetric. The symmetric submodel $N$ therefore coincides with the full generic extension $V[G]$, which satisfies the Axiom of Choice. In particular, $\\mathcal{A}$ has a choice function in $N$. Thus D is Incorrect.\n\nConclusion. Only Option A correctly specifies a forcing, group, and normal filter that produce, via the symmetric submodel method, a countable family of $2$-element sets with no choice function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3038980"}]}
