A foundational result in model theory establishes that $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ admits quantifier elimination. This property is crucial, as it implies that any first-order formula $\\phi(x)$ with parameters from a set $A$ is equivalent, modulo $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$, to a quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x)$ using the same free variable and parameters. Consequently, a complete $1$-type $p(x)$ over a parameter set $A \\subseteq M$ is uniquely determined by the quantifier-free formulas it contains. The basic quantifier-free formulas with a single free variable $x$ and parameters from $A$ are of the form $x < a$, $x=a$, and $a < x$ for some $a \\in A$.\n\nLet $A \\subseteq M$ be a finite set of parameters with cardinality $|A| = n$.\nIf $n=0$, then $A=\\emptyset$. The theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical, meaning it has only one countable model up to isomorphism, $(\\mathbb{Q}, <)$. In any model, all elements are automorphically equivalent, so there is only one complete $1$-type over the empty set. Our formula for the number of types, $2n+1$, yields $2(0)+1=1$, which is consistent with this case.\n\nNow, let us assume $n > 0$. Since $(M, <)$ is a linear order, we can list the elements of $A$ in increasing order:\n$$a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_n$$\nA complete $1$-type $p(x)$ over $A$ is determined by the position of a putative element realizing the type relative to all elements of $A$. Due to the law of trichotomy and transitivity, this position must be consistently defined. The set of parameters $A$ partitions the linear order into a series of points and open intervals. Each complete $1$-type corresponds to asserting that $x$ lies in one of these disjoint regions. We can enumerate these possibilities as follows:\n\n1.  **Types realized by elements of $A$**: For each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there exists a type containing the formula $x=a_i$. This is the principal type of the element $a_i$ over $A$, denoted $tp(a_i/A)$. It consists of all $\\mathcal{L}$-formulas $\\phi(x)$ with parameters in $A$ such that $M \\models \\phi(a_i)$. As there are $n$ distinct elements in $A$, this accounts for $n$ distinct complete types.\n\n2.  **Types describing an element in an open interval between elements of $A$**: For each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, a type can be defined by the conjunction of formulas $a_i < x$ and $x < a_{i+1}$. This fully determines the ordering of $x$ with respect to all elements of $A$; specifically, the type contains $\\{a_j < x \\mid j \\le i\\}$ and $\\{x < a_j \\mid j > i\\}$. The existence of an element realizing such a type, and thus the consistency of the type, is guaranteed by the axiom of density in $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$. Since there are $n-1$ such consecutive pairs $(a_i, a_{i+1})$, this accounts for $n-1$ distinct complete types.\n\n3.  **Types describing \"unbounded\" elements**: We can define types for elements that lie outside the range of elements in $A$.\n    *   One type corresponds to an element being less than all elements in $A$. This type is determined by the formula $x < a_1$, which implies $x < a_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The consistency of this type is guaranteed by the axiom that the order has no minimum element. This accounts for $1$ complete type.\n    *   Another type corresponds to an element being greater than all elements in $A$. This type is determined by the formula $a_n < x$, which implies $a_i < x$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The consistency of this type is guaranteed by the axiom that the order has no maximum element. This accounts for $1$ complete type.\n\nThese cases are mutually exclusive and, as a consequence of quantifier elimination, exhaustive. The total number of complete $1$-types over a set $A$ of size $n$ is the sum of the counts from these cases:\n$$N = n + (n-1) + 2 = 2n+1$$\nThus, for any finite parameter set $A \\subseteq M$ with $|A|=n$, there are exactly $2n+1$ complete $1$-types over $A$.\n\nNext, we deduce the consequence for $\\omega$-saturation. A model $M$ is $\\omega$-saturated if every complete type over any finite parameter set $A \\subseteq M$ is realized in $M$. Let's examine if the $2n+1$ types we identified must be realized in any model $M \\models T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$.\n\n*   The $n$ principal types corresponding to $x=a_i$ are, by definition, realized by the elements $a_i \\in A \\subseteq M$.\n*   The $n-1$ non-principal types defined by the condition $a_i < x < a_{i+1}$ (for $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$) are realized. The axiom of density in $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ states that for any $u,v \\in M$ with $u<v$, there exists a $z \\in M$ with $u<z<v$. Applying this to $u=a_i$ and $v=a_{i+1}$ guarantees the existence of an element realizing each of these types.\n*   The non-principal type defined by $x < a_1$ is realized. The axiom of no endpoints (no minimum) guarantees that for any element, there is a smaller one. Thus, there exists an element $c \\in M$ such that $c < a_1$.\n*   The non-principal type defined by $a_n < x$ is realized. The axiom of no endpoints (no maximum) guarantees that for any element, there is a larger one. Thus, there exists an element $d \\in M$ such that $a_n < d$.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that for any finite set of parameters $A$, every possible complete $1$-type over $A$ is guaranteed to be realized by the very axioms of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$. While we have focused on $1$-types, the reasoning extends to complete $k$-types for any finite $k$, as they are determined by the relative ordering of $k$ variables among themselves and with respect to $A$, and the axioms similarly guarantee that any such consistent ordering can be realized.\n\nThe structural consequence is, therefore, that **every model of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ is $\\omega$-saturated**. This is a powerful property, and $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ is a canonical example of a theory whose axioms are so strong that they force all models to be $\\omega$-saturated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2n+1}$$", "id": "3051190"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a theory where a form of saturation comes 'for free,' we now probe the finer distinctions between core model-theoretic properties.

For such theories, a countable model is homogeneous if we can construct an automorphism extending any partial elementary map $f: A \\to B$ between finite subsets. This is typically done with a back-and-forth argument.\n\nLet $f: A \\to B$ be a partial elementary map between two finite subsets of $M$.

Because $T$ has quantifier elimination, this just means $d$ must have the same \"color\" (the set of predicates $P_n$ it satisfies) as $c$, and must be distinct from elements in $\\operatorname{ran}(f_k)$. The axioms of $T$ state that any finite predicate pattern is satisfied by infinitely many elements. A more general model-theoretic fact is that in any countable model of $T$, any realized 1-type over $\\emptyset$ (a color) is realized infinitely often. Since the range of $f_k$ is finite, we can always find such a $d$.\n*   **\"Back\" step**: Symmetrically, for any element in the range, we can find a corresponding element for the domain.\n\nBy alternating these steps to cover all elements of $M$, we can construct a full automorphism of $M$ that extends $f$. Therefore, $M$ is homogeneous.\n\n**2. Proof that $M$ is not saturated.**\n\nA model is saturated if it realizes all consistent types over parameter sets smaller than its cardinality. Since $M$ is countable ($\\kappa = \\aleph_0$), saturation means it must realize all complete types over all *finite* parameter sets. We will show it fails to realize a type over the empty set, $A=\\emptyset$.\n\nA complete $1$-type over $\\emptyset$ is determined by which formulas $P_n(x)$ it contains for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.

Each element can realize at most one of these types (one color). Therefore, $M$ can realize at most $\\aleph_0$ distinct types over $\\emptyset$.\nSince $2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0$, there must be uncountably many types that are not realized in $M$. Let's pick one such omitted type, $p(x)$.\n\nTo be a valid counterexample, we must confirm this type $p(x)$ is consistent with $\\operatorname{Th}(M)$. By the Compactness Theorem, a type is consistent if every finite subset of it is satisfiable. Any finite subset of $p(x)$ specifies a boolean pattern for a finite set of predicates $F \\subset \\mathbb{N}$.

The first formula states that $x$ belongs to the same equivalence class as $a$, which is $C_0$. The other formulas state that $x$ is distinct from every element in $C_0$.\n\nWe must show that this set of formulas is consistent, which means it is finitely satisfiable in $M$. Let $\\Sigma_0(x)$ be any finite subset of $\\Sigma(x)$. $\\Sigma_0(x)$ will be of the form:\n$$ \\Sigma_0(x) = \\{ E(x,a), x \\neq c_1, x \\neq c_2, \\ldots, x \\neq c_n \\}$$\nfor some finite collection of elements $\\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n\\} \\subset C_0$.\nTo find an element in $M$ that satisfies $\\Sigma_0(x)$, we need to find an element $m \\in |M|$ such that $m \\in C_0$ and $m \\notin \\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n\\}$. Since the class $C_0$ is infinite ($|C_0|=\\aleph_0$), the set $C_0 \\setminus \\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n\\}$ is non-empty. In fact, it is infinite. We can choose any element $m$ from this set. This $m$ satisfies $\\Sigma_0(x)$.\nSince every finite subset of $\\Sigma(x)$ is satisfiable in $M$, by the Compactness Theorem, the entire set of formulas $\\Sigma(x)$ is satisfiable in some elementary extension of $M$. This implies the existence of a complete $1$-type $p(x)$ over $A=C_0$ which contains $\\Sigma(x)$.\n\nNow, we check if this type $p(x)$ is realized in $M$. A realization of $p(x)$ in $M$ would be an element $m \\in |M|$ that satisfies all formulas in $p(x)$, and therefore all formulas in $\\Sigma(x)$.\nFrom the formula $E(x,a)$, we must have $m \\in C_0$.\nFrom the set of formulas $\\{ x \\neq c \\mid c \\in C_0 \\}$, we must have $m \\neq c$ for all $c \\in C_0$, which implies $m \\notin C_0$.\nThese two conditions, $m \\in C_0$ and $m \\notin C_0$, are contradictory. Thus, no such element $m$ exists in $|M|$.\nThe type $p(x)$ is not realized in $M$. We have found a parameter set $A=C_0$ with $|A|<|M|$ and a complete type over $A$ that is not realized in $M$.

This means there exists an $L$-formula $\\psi(x)$ such that $M \\models \\psi(a)$ and $M \\models \\neg\\psi(b)$.\nBy the downward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, there exists a countable elementary substructure $M_0 \\preceq M$ such that $\\{a,b\\} \\subset |M_0|$.\nSince $M_0$ is an elementary substructure of $M$, we have $M_0 \\models \\psi(a)$ and $M_0 \\models \\neg\\psi(b)$.\nLet's examine the structure of $M_0$. Since $|M_0|$ is countable, every subset of $|M_0|$ is at most countable.\nThe relation $E^{M_0}$ is the restriction of $E^M$ to $|M_0|$. For any element $m \\in |M_0|$, its equivalence class in $M_0$ is $[m]_{M_0} = [m]_{M} \\cap |M_0|$.\nThe element $a$ belongs to the class $C_0$ in $M$, with $|C_0|=\\aleph_0$. Since $M_0 \\preceq M$, $M_0$ must believe that the class of $a$ is infinite. That is, for every natural number $n$, $M \\models \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_n (\\bigwedge_{i \\neq j} y_i \\neq y_j \\land \\bigwedge_i E(a, y_i))$, so $M_0$ must satisfy the same sentences. Hence, $[a]_{M_0}$ must be an infinite set. Since it is a subset of $|M_0|$, it is countably infinite.\nSimilarly, $b$ belongs to class $C_1$ in $M$, with $|C_1|=\\kappa$. The class $[b]_{M_0}$ must also be infinite for the same reason, and thus countably infinite.\nAlso, $M$ has infinitely many equivalence classes, so for any natural number $m$, $M$ models the sentence stating there are at least $m$ classes. By elementarity, $M_0$ must also model these sentences, so $M_0$ has infinitely many equivalence classes. Each of these is a subset of $|M_0|$ and thus at most countable. Since they must be infinite, they are all countably infinite.\nSo, $M_0$ is a structure consisting of a countable infinity of disjoint, countably infinite equivalence classes. Let the classes of $a$ and $b$ in $M_0$ be $C'_a = [a]_{M_0}$ and $C'_b = [b]_{M_0}$.\nWe can construct an automorphism $f$ of $M_0$ that maps $a$ to $b$. Let the set of equivalence classes of $M_0$ be $\\mathcal{C}'$. Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{C}' \\to \\mathcal{C}'$ be a permutation that swaps $C'_a$ and $C'_b$ and fixes every other class. For each class $C \\in \\mathcal{C}'$, we define a bijection $h_C: C \\to \\pi(C)$. Specifically:\n- Let $h_{C'_a}: C'_a \\to C'_b$ be a bijection such that $h_{C'_a}(a)=b$. This is possible because $C'_a$ and $C'_b$ are both countably infinite sets and $a \\in C'_a, b \\in C'_b$.\n- Let $h_{C'_b}: C'_b \\to C'_a$ be any bijection.\n- For any other class $D \\in \\mathcal{C}'$ (where $D \\neq C'_a, C'_b$), let $h_D: D \\to D$ be the identity map.\nNow define the map $f: |M_0| \\to |M_0|$ by $f(x) = h_C(x)$ if $x \\in C$.\nThis map $f$ is a permutation of $|M_0|$. It is also an automorphism because for any $x,y \\in |M_0|$, $E^{M_0}(x,y)$ holds if and only if $x$ and $y$ are in the same equivalence class $C$, which is true if and only if $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are in the same class $\\pi(C)$, which means $E^{M_0}(f(x),f(y))$ holds.\nWe have constructed an automorphism $f$ of $M_0$ such that $f(a)=b$.\nAutomorphisms preserve the truth of all formulas. Since $f$ is an automorphism of $M_0$, we must have $M_0 \\models \\psi(a) \\iff M_0 \\models \\psi(f(a))$.\nSince $f(a)=b$, this means $M_0 \\models \\psi(a) \\iff M_0 \\models \\psi(b)$.\nThis contradicts our finding that $M_0 \\models \\psi(a)$ and $M_0 \\models \\neg\\psi(b)$.\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be false. There is no $L$-formula $\\psi(x)$ separating $a$ and $b$. Thus, $\\operatorname{tp}(a/\\emptyset)=\\operatorname{tp}(b/\\emptyset)$.\n\n3. **Proof that there is no automorphism of $M$ sending $a$ to $b$.**\nAn automorphism $\\sigma$ of a structure is a permutation of its domain that preserves all relations in the language. For our structure $M$, this means $\\sigma: |M| \\to |M|$ must be a bijection, and for any $x, y \\in |M|$, $E^M(x,y) \\iff E^M(\\sigma(x), \\sigma(y))$.\nThis condition implies that an automorphism must map equivalence classes to equivalence classes.\nFurthermore, since $\\sigma$ is a bijection, the image of any set under $\\sigma$ must have the same cardinality as the original set. In particular, for any equivalence class $C$, we must have $|\\sigma(C)|=|C|$.\nThe equivalence classes of $M$ are $C_0$ and $C_\\alpha$ for $\\alpha < \\kappa$. Their cardinalities are $|C_0|=\\aleph_0$ and $|C_\\alpha|=\\kappa$.\nThere is only one equivalence class of cardinality $\\aleph_0$, which is $C_0$. All other $\\kappa$ classes have cardinality $\\kappa$.\nLet $\\sigma$ be any automorphism of $M$. Consider the class $C_0$. The image $\\sigma(C_0)$ must be an equivalence class, and it must have cardinality $|\\sigma(C_0)|=|C_0|=\\aleph_0$. The only equivalence class in $M$ with cardinality $\\aleph_0$ is $C_0$ itself. Therefore, any automorphism $\\sigma$ of $M$ must map $C_0$ to itself, i.e., $\\sigma(C_0)=C_0$.\nNow, assume for contradiction that there exists an automorphism $\\sigma$ of $M$ such that $\\sigma(a)=b$.\nWe are given that $a \\in C_0$. By definition of the image of a set, $\\sigma(a) \\in \\sigma(C_0)$.\nAs we have just shown, $\\sigma(C_0)=C_0$. This implies $\\sigma(a) \\in C_0$.\nSo, if such an automorphism exists, we must have $b \\in C_0$.\nHowever, we are given that $b \\in C_1$. Since the equivalence classes form a partition of $|M|$, the sets $C_0$ and $C_1$ are disjoint. So $b \\in C_1$ implies $b \\notin C_0$.\nThis is a contradiction. The conclusion $b \\in C_0$ contradicts the given information $b \\in C_1$.\nThus, the assumption must be false. There is no automorphism of $M$ sending $a$ to $b$.\n\n4. **Value of $N$.**\nThe problem defines $N$ as the number of automorphisms of $M$ that map $a$ to $b$:\n$$ N \\;=\\; \\left|\\left\\{\\, \\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(M) \\;:\\; \\sigma(a)=b \\,\\right\\}\\right|. $$\nIn part 3, we proved that no such automorphism exists.
