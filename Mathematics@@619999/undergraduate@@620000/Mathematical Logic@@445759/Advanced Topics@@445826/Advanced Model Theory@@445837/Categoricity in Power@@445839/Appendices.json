For any vector space $V$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, its dimension is the cardinality of any basis, denoted $\\dim(V)$. Work in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Consider two $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-vector spaces $V$ and $W$ with dimensions possibly finite or infinite, denoted $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$, respectively.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of a basis and dimension and standard counting principles, derive a general expression for the cardinality $|V|$ of a vector space $V$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ in terms of $\\dim(V)$, distinguishing between the cases $\\dim(V) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\dim(V)$ an infinite cardinal.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no mathematical or logical flaws. We proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities, $E(q)$ and $N(\\mu)$, related to vector spaces over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The first step is to derive a general expression for the cardinality of an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-vector space $V$ as a function of its dimension, $\\dim(V)$. Let $\\kappa = \\dim(V)$. We work within ZFC, which guarantees that every vector space has a basis.\n\nA vector $v \\in V$ is a unique linear combination of a finite number of vectors from any given basis $\\mathcal{B}$. Let $|\\mathcal{B}| = \\kappa$. This means $V$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of $\\kappa$ copies of $\\mathbb{F}_q$, denoted $\\bigoplus_{\\kappa} \\mathbb{F}_q$. The elements of this direct sum are functions $f: \\kappa \\to \\mathbb{F}_q$ with finite support, where the support of $f$ is the set $\\text{supp}(f) = \\{\\alpha \\in \\kappa \\mid f(\\alpha) \\neq 0\\}$. The cardinality of $V$ is the cardinality of this set of functions.\n\nWe distinguish between two cases for the dimension $\\kappa$.\n\nCase 1: $\\kappa$ is a finite cardinal, i.e., $\\dim(V) = n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$.\nIf $\\dim(V) = n$, a basis for $V$ is a finite set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$. Any vector $v \\in V$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination $v = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i v_i$, where each coefficient $c_i$ is an element of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This establishes a bijection between the vectors in $V$ and the $n$-tuples in $\\mathbb{F}_q^n$.\nThe cardinality of $V$ is therefore:\n$$|V| = |\\mathbb{F}_q^n| = |\\mathbb{F}_q|^n = q^n$$\nSo, if $\\dim(V) = n$ is finite, $|V| = q^n$.\n\nCase 2: $\\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal.\nLet $\\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for $V$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| = \\kappa$. As established, $V$ can be identified with the set of functions from $\\mathcal{B}$ to $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with finite support.\n$$V \\cong \\{f: \\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{F}_q \\mid |\\text{supp}(f)|  \\aleph_0\\}$$\nLet's compute the cardinality of this set. An element $v \\in V$ is specified by a finite subset of the basis, $S \\subset \\mathcal{B}$, and a choice of coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$ for each basis vector in $S$.\nThe set $V$ can be expressed as the union of subspaces spanned by all finite subsets of the basis:\n$$V = \\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathcal{P}_{fin}(\\mathcal{B})} \\text{span}(S)$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{fin}(\\mathcal{B})$ is the set of all finite subsets of $\\mathcal{B}$.\nLet's analyze the cardinality of this union using cardinal arithmetic.\nThe number of finite subsets of an infinite set $\\mathcal{B}$ of cardinality $\\kappa$ is $|\\mathcal{P}_{fin}(\\mathcal{B})| = \\kappa$.\nFor any finite subset $S \\subset \\mathcal{B}$ with $|S|=k$, the subspace $\\text{span}(S)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_q^k$ and has cardinality $q^k$. Since $k$ is finite and $q$ is finite, $q^k$ is also finite.\nThe cardinality of the union is bounded above by the product of the number of sets in the union and the supremum of their cardinalities.\n$$|V| = \\left| \\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathcal{P}_{fin}(\\mathcal{B})} \\text{span}(S) \\right| \\leq |\\mathcal{P}_{fin}(\\mathcal{B})| \\cdot \\sup_{S \\in \\mathcal{P}_{fin}(\\mathcal{B})} |\\text{span}(S)|$$\nWe have $|\\mathcal{P}_{fin}(\\mathcal{B})| = \\kappa$.\nThe supremum of the cardinalities of the subspaces is $\\sup_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0} q^k$. Since $q \\geq 2$ is a finite integer, this supremum is $\\aleph_0$.\nThus, we have an upper bound: $|V| \\leq \\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\max(\\kappa, \\aleph_0) = \\kappa$ (since $\\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal, $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_0$).\n\nFor a lower bound, consider the set of vectors formed by taking a single basis vector $b \\in \\mathcal{B}$ and scaling it by any non-zero element $c \\in \\mathbb{F}_q \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The vectors $\\{c \\cdot b \\mid b \\in \\mathcal{B}, c \\in \\mathbb{F}_q \\setminus \\{0\\}\\}$ are all distinct.\nThe cardinality of this set of vectors is $|\\mathcal{B}| \\cdot |\\mathbb{F}_q \\setminus \\{0\\}| = \\kappa \\cdot (q-1)$.\nSince $q \\geq 2$, $q-1 \\geq 1$. As $\\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal, $\\kappa \\cdot (q-1) = \\kappa$.\nSo, we have a lower bound: $|V| \\ge \\kappa$.\nCombining the bounds, $\\kappa \\leq |V| \\leq \\kappa$, which implies $|V| = \\kappa$.\n\nSummary of the cardinality formula:\nLet $V$ be a vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $\\dim(V) = \\kappa$.\n- If $\\kappa$ is finite, $|V| = q^\\kappa$.\n- If $\\kappa$ is infinite, $|V| = \\kappa$.\n\nNow we address the two questions.\n\n**1. Computation of $E(q)$**\n$E(q)$ is the number of ordered pairs $(\\kappa, \\lambda)$ of cardinals with $\\kappa \\neq \\lambda$ such that there exist $\\mathbb{F}_q$-vector spaces $V$ and $W$ with $\\dim(V)=\\kappa$, $\\dim(W)=\\lambda$, and $|V|=|W|$. We analyze the condition $|V|=|W|$ based on whether $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ are finite or infinite.\n\n- Case (i): $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ are both finite. Let $\\kappa=n$ and $\\lambda=m$ for $n, m \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$ and $n \\neq m$. The condition $|V|=|W|$ becomes $q^n = q^m$. Since $q \\geq 2$, this equality holds if and only if $n=m$, which contradicts the requirement $\\kappa \\neq \\lambda$. There are no solutions in this case.\n\n- Case (ii): One dimension is finite and the other is infinite. Let $\\kappa=n$ be finite and $\\lambda$ be infinite. The condition $|V|=|W|$ is $q^n = \\lambda$. But $q^n$ is a finite number, whereas $\\lambda$ is an infinite cardinal. A finite cardinal cannot equal an infinite cardinal. Thus, there are no solutions. The symmetric case with $\\kappa$ infinite and $\\lambda$ finite also yields no solutions.\n\n- Case (iii): $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ are both infinite. The condition $|V|=|W|$ becomes $\\kappa = \\lambda$. This contradicts the requirement $\\kappa \\neq \\lambda$. There are no solutions in this case.\n\nIn all possible cases, the condition $|V|=|W|$ is logically incompatible with the condition $\\kappa \\neq \\lambda$. Therefore, there are no such ordered pairs $(\\kappa, \\lambda)$.\nThe number of such pairs is $E(q) = 0$.\n\n**2. Computation of $N(\\mu)$**\n$N(\\mu)$ is the number of pairwise non-isomorphic $\\mathbb{F}_q$-vector spaces of a given infinite cardinality $\\mu$.\nA fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that two vector spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.\n$$V \\cong W \\iff \\dim(V) = \\dim(W)$$\nTherefore, counting the number of non-isomorphic vector spaces of a certain cardinality is equivalent to counting the number of possible dimensions that can produce that cardinality.\n\nLet $V$ be an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-vector space with $|V|=\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is an infinite cardinal. Let $\\dim(V) = \\kappa$.\n- If $\\kappa$ were finite, say $\\kappa=n$, then $|V|=q^n$, which is a finite number. This contradicts $|V|=\\mu$ being infinite. So, the dimension $\\kappa$ must be infinite.\n- If $\\kappa$ is infinite, then $|V|=\\kappa$.\nFor $|V|$ to be equal to the infinite cardinal $\\mu$, we must have $\\kappa = \\mu$.\n\nThis demonstrates that for a vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ to have an infinite cardinality $\\mu$, its dimension must be precisely $\\mu$. There is only one possible value for the dimension.\nSince all vector spaces of a given dimension are isomorphic, there exists exactly one isomorphism class of vector spaces of cardinality $\\mu$. For any infinite cardinal $\\mu$, we can construct such a space (e.g., $\\bigoplus_\\mu \\mathbb{F}_q$), so this class is non-empty.\nThus, the number of pairwise non-isomorphic $\\mathbb{F}_q$-vector spaces of cardinality $\\mu$ is $1$.\n$N(\\mu) = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(E(q), N(\\mu))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3038503"}, {"introduction": "After exploring an algebraic example, we now turn to the simplest possible infinite structure: a pure set with no relations or functions other than equality.

This means $\\varphi$ has an infinite model (any countably infinite set). The language $\\mathcal{L} = \\{=\\}$ is finite, hence countable. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem states that if a theory in a countable language has an infinite model, it has a model of every larger infinite cardinality.\nSince $\\varphi$ has a model of cardinality $\\aleph_0$, the theory $T = \\{\\varphi\\}$ must have a model of any cardinality $\\kappa  \\aleph_0$. For example, $T$ must have a model of cardinality $\\aleph_1$. This model of cardinality $\\aleph_1$ would be a model of $\\varphi$, but it is not countably infinite.

Thus, no such sentence $\\varphi$ can exist.\n\nTherefore, statement A is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The theory $T_\\infty$ axiomatizes the class of all infinite sets and is complete.**\n\nThis statement has two claims. Let's analyze them separately.\nClaim 1: $T_\\infty$ axiomatizes the class of all infinite sets.\nA model $M$ of $T_\\infty$ must satisfy every sentence $\\varphi_n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The sentence $\\varphi_n$ asserts that there are at least $n$ distinct elements in the domain. If $M \\models \\varphi_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then the cardinality of $M$ must be greater than or equal to $n$ for all natural numbers $n$. This is the definition of an infinite set. Conversely, if $M$ is an infinite set, then for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, one can find $n$ distinct elements in $M$, so $M \\models \\varphi_n$. Since this holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $M \\models T_\\infty$. Thus, the models of $T_\\infty$ are precisely the infinite sets. The first claim is correct.\n\nClaim 2: $T_\\infty$ is complete.\nWe can use the Łoś–Vaught test to determine if $T_\\infty$ is complete. The test states that if a theory $T$ in a countable language has no finite models and is $\\kappa$-categorical for some infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, then $T$ is complete.\n1.  The language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{=\\}$ is countable.\n2.  As established above, the models of $T_\\infty$ are precisely the infinite sets. Thus, $T_\\infty$ has no finite models.\n3.  We need to check if $T_\\infty$ is $\\kappa$-categorical for some infinite $\\kappa$. Let $\\kappa$ be any infinite cardinal. Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two models of $T_\\infty$ of cardinality $\\kappa$. This means $M_1$ and $M_2$ are sets with $|M_1| = |M_2| = \\kappa$. An isomorphism between these structures in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{=\\}$ is simply a bijection between the sets $M_1$ and $M_2$. By the definition of two sets having the same cardinality, there exists a bijection between them. Therefore, $M_1$ and $M_2$ are isomorphic. This holds for any two models of the same infinite cardinality $\\kappa$. Hence, $T_\\infty$ is $\\kappa$-categorical for every infinite cardinal $\\kappa$.\nSince $T_\\infty$ satisfies the conditions of the Łoś–Vaught test (e.g., it is $\\aleph_0$-categorical and has no finite models), it is complete. The second claim is also correct.\n\nSince both claims are correct, statement B is **Correct**.\n\n**C. For any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, there is no first-order theory in a countable language whose models are exactly the structures of cardinality $\\kappa$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Let $T$ be any first-order theory in a countable language and let $\\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the class of models of $T$ is exactly the class of structures of cardinality $\\kappa$.\nCase 1: $\\kappa = \\aleph_0$. The theory $T$ has a model of cardinality $\\aleph_0$. By the upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, $T$ must also have models of any cardinality greater than $\\aleph_0$. This contradicts the assumption that all models of $T$ have cardinality $\\aleph_0$.\nCase 2: $\\kappa  \\aleph_0$. The theory $T$ has a model of cardinality $\\kappa$. By the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, since the language is countable, $T$ must also have a model of cardinality $\\aleph_0$. This contradicts the assumption that all models of $T$ have cardinality $\\kappa  \\aleph_0$.\nIn both cases, we arrive at a contradiction. Therefore, no such theory $T$ can exist.\n\nTherefore, statement C is **Correct**.\n\n**D. In the language $\\{=\\}$, for each infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, any two models of $T_\\infty$ of cardinality $\\kappa$ are isomorphic; hence $T_\\infty$ is $\\kappa$-categorical for every infinite $\\kappa$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. As demonstrated in the analysis of option B, a model of $T_\\infty$ is simply an infinite set. Let $\\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal. Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two models of $T_\\infty$, both of cardinality $\\kappa$. In the language of pure equality $\\mathcal{L}=\\{=\\}$, an isomorphism between $M_1$ and $M_2$ is a bijection $f: M_1 \\to M_2$. Such a map always preserves the equality relation in the required way: for any $x, y \\in M_1$, $x=y$ if and only if $f(x)=f(y)$ (this is is a consequence of $f$ being a well-defined, injective function). By the very definition of two sets having the same cardinality $\\kappa$, a bijection between them exists. Thus, any two models of $T_\\infty$ of cardinality $\\kappa$ are isomorphic. By the definition of $\\kappa$-categoricity, this means $T_\\infty$ is $\\kappa$-categorical. This holds for every infinite cardinal $\\kappa$.\n\nTherefore, statement D is **Correct**.\n\n**E. Because no first-order theory can control the exact cardinality of its models, no first-order theory can be categorical in any infinite power.**\n\nThis statement presents a fallacious argument. Let's analyze its components.\nThe premise, \"no first-order theory can control the exact cardinality of its models,\" is a correct consequence of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorems, as established in the analysis of option C. More precisely, for uncountable languages we also have a similar result, so the spectrum of a theory with an infinite model is never a singleton.\nThe conclusion is \"no first-order theory can be categorical in any infinite power.\" A theory $T$ is categorical in an infinite power $\\kappa$ (i.e., $\\kappa$-categorical) if it has exactly one model of cardinality $\\kappa$ up to isomorphism. This property does not require that the theory has *only* models of cardinality $\\kappa$.\nThe theory $T_\\infty$ serves as a direct counterexample to this conclusion. As shown in the analysis of option D, $T_\\infty$ is $\\kappa$-categorical for *every* infinite cardinal $\\kappa$. However, $T_\\infty$ has models of all infinite cardinalities, not just one.\nThe premise is true, but the conclusion is false.

The explanation must be based on the Löwenheim–Skolem (LS) theorems.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the setup. A theory $T$ is categorical in an infinite cardinal $\\mu$ if it has a model of cardinality $\\mu$, and all models of $T$ of cardinality $\\mu$ are isomorphic. We are given that $T$ is a complete theory with an infinite model. By the upward and downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorems, such a theory has models of every infinite cardinality. Thus, the condition of having \"at least one model of cardinality $\\lambda$\" is always satisfied for any infinite $\\lambda$. The question of categoricity in $\\lambda$ therefore reduces to the question of uniqueness: are all models of $T$ of cardinality $\\lambda$ isomorphic?\n\nWe are given that $T$ is categorical in $\\kappa$. Let $M_\\kappa$ be the unique model of $T$ of cardinality $\\kappa$ (up to isomorphism). We want to understand why $T$ might not be categorical in a smaller cardinal $\\lambda  \\kappa$.\n\nThe downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is the key tool for relating the model $M_\\kappa$ to models of the smaller size $\\lambda$. The theorem states that for any subset $A$ of the domain of $M_\\kappa$ with $|A| \\leq \\lambda$, there exists an elementary substructure $N \\preccurlyeq M_\\kappa$ such that $A \\subseteq N$ and $|N| \\leq \\max\\{|A|, |L|, \\aleph_0\\}$. Assuming $|L| \\leq \\lambda$, we can choose a subset $A$ of size $\\lambda$ to ensure the existence of an elementary substructure of size $\\lambda$.\n\nAny such elementary substructure $N$ is itself a model of $T$. The downward LS theorem thus provides a mechanism for constructing models of size $\\lambda$ from the unique model of size $\\kappa$. The core of the problem lies in recognizing what this theorem does and does not guarantee. It guarantees the *existence* of such smaller elementary substructures, but it makes no claim about their *isomorphism type*.\n\nIt is possible to choose two different subsets, $A_1$ and $A_2$, of $M_\\kappa$ and find that the elementary substructures they generate (for example, their Skolem hulls) are not isomorphic. If we can find two such non-isomorphic elementary substructures of $M_\\kappa$ of cardinality $\\lambda$, then we have found two non-isomorphic models of $T$ of cardinality $\\lambda$. In this case, $T$ is not categorical in $\\lambda$. This is the fundamental reason why categoricity in a larger cardinal $\\kappa$ does not imply categoricity in a smaller cardinal $\\lambda$.\n\nLet's now analyze each option based on this principle.\n\n**A. The downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem ensures that from a model $M$ of $T$ of size $\\kappa$ one can construct elementary substructures of size $\\lambda$ by taking Skolem hulls of $\\lambda$-sized parameter sets. Since downward Löwenheim–Skolem guarantees existence but not uniqueness of such $\\lambda$-sized elementary substructures, different choices of parameter sets can yield non-isomorphic $\\lambda$-sized models. Thus, categoricity in $\\kappa$ does not force categoricity in $\\lambda$.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the situation. It correctly identifies that downward LS is a construction method for smaller models, and crucially points out that this construction does not guarantee uniqueness of the isomorphism type. The possibility of generating non-isomorphic models from different \"parameter sets\" (subsets of the larger model) is precisely the reason for the failure of categoricity to transfer downwards. This explanation is sound and directly addresses the prompt.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that if $T$ is categorical in $\\kappa$, then for any two $\\lambda$-sized models $M_1,M_2$ of $T$ with $\\lambda\\kappa$, there are elementary embeddings of $M_1$ and $M_2$ into the unique $\\kappa$-sized model, which forces $M_1\\cong M_2$. Therefore, categoricity in $\\kappa$ transfers downward to all $\\lambda\\kappa$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. It draws a false conclusion from a correct premise. Given two models $M_1, M_2$ of size $\\lambda$, the upward LS theorem guarantees they have elementary extensions $N_1, N_2$ of size $\\kappa$. Since $T$ is $\\kappa$-categorical, $N_1 \\cong N_2$. So both $M_1$ and $M_2$ can be elementarily embedded into the same $\\kappa$-sized model, $M_\\kappa$. However, this does not force $M_1 \\cong M_2$. $M_\\kappa$ can contain many non-isomorphic elementary substructures of size $\\lambda$. The argument makes an unwarranted leap in logic. The conclusion that categoricity transfers downward is a known falsehood in model theory.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In a countable language $L$, Morley’s theorem states that categoricity in one uncountable cardinal transfers to all uncountable cardinals. Hence it is consistent that $T$ is categorical in $\\kappa$ while failing to be categorical in $\\lambda=\\aleph_0$. Concretely, by the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, from a $\\kappa$-sized model one can take elementary substructures of size $\\aleph_0$, but there is no general mechanism ensuring that all such countable elementary substructures are isomorphic.**\n\nThis statement provides a correct and insightful explanation. It begins by citing Morley's Categoricity Theorem, which is a cornerstone result establishing that for countable languages, categoricity in one uncountable cardinal implies categoricity in all uncountable cardinals. This theorem makes the distinction between countable ($\\aleph_0$) and uncountable cardinals central to the study of categoricity, directly motivating the scenario in the problem. The statement correctly identifies that this makes it possible for a theory to be, for example, $\\aleph_1$-categorical but not $\\aleph_0$-categorical. The concrete reason it provides is the same as in option A, specialized to the case $\\lambda = \\aleph_0$: the downward LS theorem allows the construction of countable elementary substructures from an uncountable model, but does not guarantee they are all isomorphic. A classic example is the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$, which is categorical in every uncountable cardinal but has countably many non-isomorphic countable models. This option correctly explains the phenomenon by providing both the high-level theoretical context and the correct low-level mechanism.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. If $T$ is complete and has an infinite model, then by the Löwenheim–Skolem theorems $T$ is categorical in every infinite cardinal, since these theorems guarantee the existence of exactly one model in each infinite cardinality.**\n\nThis statement is grossly incorrect. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorems guarantee the *existence* of models of different infinite cardinalities, not their *uniqueness*. The claim that they \"guarantee the existence of exactly one model\" is a fundamental misunderstanding of the theorems. Most theories are not categorical in any cardinal, let alone all of them.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If $T$ is categorical in $\\kappa$, then by downward Löwenheim–Skolem there is, up to isomorphism, a unique elementary substructure of size $\\lambda$ inside any $\\kappa$-sized model of $T$, so $T$ must be categorical in $\\lambda$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect and its reasoning is fallacious. It falsely claims that the downward LS theorem implies the uniqueness of the isomorphism type of elementary substructures. This is precisely the point that is not guaranteed, and which allows categoricity to fail. The statement essentially assumes its conclusion by misstating the power of the downward LS theorem. The conclusion that $T$ must be categorical in $\\lambda$ is both contrary to known results and based on a false premise.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3038496"}]}
