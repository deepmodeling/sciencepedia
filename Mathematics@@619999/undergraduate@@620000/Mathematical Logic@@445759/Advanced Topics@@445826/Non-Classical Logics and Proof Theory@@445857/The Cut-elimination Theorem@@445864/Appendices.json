All terms are formally defined, the setup is self-contained and consistent, and the question is objective and well-posed.\n\nThe initial derivation, which we shall denote $\\mathcal{D}_1$, contains a single application of the cut rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\n\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, A \\qquad \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, B}{\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, A \\land B}\\ (\\land R)\n\\qquad\n\\frac{\\Gamma', A, B \\vdash \\Delta'}{\\Gamma', A \\land B \\vdash \\Delta'}\\ (\\land L)\n}{\n\\Gamma, \\Gamma' \\vdash \\Delta, \\Delta'\n}\\ \\text{(cut on $A \\land B$)}\n$$\nThis is a principal cut because the cut formula, $A \\land B$, is the principal formula of the last inference in each of the two premises: the $(\\land R)$ rule on the left and the $(\\land L)$ rule on the right.\n\nThe maximum cut rank of a derivation is the maximum complexity of any cut formula within that derivation. In $\\mathcal{D}_1$, there is only one cut, and its cut formula is $A \\land B$. Therefore, the maximum cut rank of the \"before\" derivation is:\n$$\nc_{\\text{before}}^{\\max} = c(A \\land B)\n$$\nUsing the provided definition for the complexity of a conjunction, $c(F \\land G) = \\max\\{c(F), c(G)\\} + 1$, we have:\n$$\nc_{\\text{before}}^{\\max} = \\max\\{c(A), c(B)\\} + 1\n$$\n\nThe problem then presents the reduced derivation, which we denote $\\mathcal{D}_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\n\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, A\n\\qquad\n\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, B \\qquad \\Gamma', A, B \\vdash \\Delta'}{\\Gamma, \\Gamma', A \\vdash \\Delta, \\Delta'}\\ \\text{(cut on $B$)}\n}{\n\\Gamma, \\Gamma' \\vdash \\Delta, \\Delta'\n}\\ \\text{(cut on $A$)}\n$$\nThis new derivation $\\mathcal{D}_2$ replaces the single cut on the compound formula $A \\land B$ with two new cuts on its immediate subformulas, $A$ and $B$.

The maximum cut rank of this \"after\" derivation is the maximum of the complexities of these two cut formulas:\n$$\nc_{\\text{after}}^{\\max} = \\max\\{c(A), c(B)\\}\n$$\nThis reduction step is a key component of the inductive proof of the cut-elimination theorem. It demonstrates that a principal cut can be eliminated and replaced by cuts on formulas of strictly smaller complexity, pushing the cuts \"upwards\" in the proof tree until they are on atomic formulas and can be removed entirely.\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the strict decrease in the maximum cut rank, $c_{\\text{before}}^{\\max} - c_{\\text{after}}^{\\max}$, for the specific case where $A$ and $B$ are instantiated as atomic formulas $P$ and $Q$, respectively. So, we set $A = P$ and $B = Q$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition of complexity, for any atomic propositional variable $p$, its complexity is $c(p) = 0$.

The problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded in mathematical logic, and internally consistent.
