We are looking for a countermodel, i.e., a Kripke model $M=(W,R,V)$ and a world $w \\in W$ such that $M,w \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$ but $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$.\n\n**1. Construction of a Countermodel**\n\nWe need to construct a model $M=(W,R,V)$ and a world $w \\in W$ such that:\n(i) $M,w \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$\n(ii) $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$\n\nCondition (i) means that for every successor $u$ of $w$ (i.e., for every $u \\in W$ such that $(w,u) \\in R$), the formula $p \\lor q$ must be true at $u$. That is, $M,u \\vDash p$ or $M,u \\vDash q$, which means $u \\in V(p)$ or $u \\in V(q)$.\n\nCondition (ii) is equivalent to $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p$ and $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box q$.\n$M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p$ means there exists a successor of $w$, let's call it $u_1$, such that $M,u_1 \\not\\vDash p$. This means $u_1 \\notin V(p)$.\n$M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box q$ means there exists a successor of $w$, let's call it $u_2$, such that $M,u_2 \\not\\vDash q$. This means $u_2 \\notin V(q)$.\n\nLet's combine these requirements.\nFrom $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p$, there exists a successor $u_1$ of $w$ with $u_1 \\notin V(p)$. By condition (i), since $u_1$ is a successor of $w$, we must have $u_1 \\in V(p)$ or $u_1 \\in V(q)$. As $u_1 \\notin V(p)$, it must be that $u_1 \\in V(q)$.\nFrom $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box q$, there exists a successor $u_2$ of $w$ with $u_2 \\notin V(q)$. By condition (i), since $u_2$ is a successor of $w$, we must have $u_2 \\in V(p)$ or $u_2 \\in V(q)$. As $u_2 \\notin V(q)$, it must be that $u_2 \\in V(p)$.\n\nSo, we have a successor $u_1$ where $p$ is false and $q$ is true, and a successor $u_2$ where $p$ is true and $q$ is false. These truth value assignments are mutually exclusive, so $u_1$ and $u_2$ must be distinct worlds. This suggests a model with at least three worlds: $w$, $u_1$, and $u_2$.\n\nLet's construct such a model explicitly.\nLet the set of worlds be $W = \\{w_0, w_1, w_2\\}$.\nLet the accessibility relation be $R = \\{(w_0, w_1), (w_0, w_2)\\}$.\nLet the valuation $V$ for propositional variables $p$ and $q$ be defined as $V(p) = \\{w_2\\}$ and $V(q) = \\{w_1\\}$.\n\nWe designate $w_0$ as the world at which we check the formula. Let's verify:\n- To check $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$: The successors of $w_0$ are $w_1$ and $w_2$.\n  - At $w_1$: We have $w_1 \\in V(q)$, so $M,w_1 \\vDash q$. This implies $M,w_1 \\vDash p \\lor q$.\n  - At $w_2$: We have $w_2 \\in V(p)$, so $M,w_2 \\vDash p$. This implies $M,w_2 \\vDash p \\lor q$.\n  Since $p \\lor q$ holds at all successors of $w_0$, we have $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$.\n\n- To check $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$: We must check that both $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box p$ and $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box q$.\n  - For $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box p$: We need to find a successor of $w_0$ where $p$ fails. Consider the successor $w_1$. Since $w_1 \\notin V(p)$, we have $M,w_1 \\not\\vDash p$. Thus, $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box p$.\n  - For $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box q$: We need to find a successor of $w_0$ where $q$ fails. Consider the successor $w_2$. Since $w_2 \\notin V(q)$, we have $M,w_2 \\not\\vDash q$. Thus, $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box q$.\nSince both disjuncts fail, $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$.\n\nThe constructed model $M=(W,R,V)$ with $W = \\{w_0, w_1, w_2\\}$, $R = \\{(w_0, w_1), (w_0, w_2)\\}$, and $V(p) = \\{w_2\\}$, $V(q) = \\{w_1\\}$, serves as a countermodel at the world $w_0$.\n\n**2. Proof of Cardinality Requirements**\n\nLet $M=(W,R,V)$ be any Kripke model and $w \\in W$ be any world such that $M,w \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$ and $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$. Let $S_w = \\{u \\in W \\mid (w,u) \\in R\\}$ be the set of $R$-successors of $w$.\n\nThe condition $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$ implies two facts:\n1. $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box p$: This means it is not true that for all successors $u \\in S_w$, $M,u \\vDash p$. By negation, there must exist at least one successor, which we will call $u_p$, such that $u_p \\in S_w$ and $M,u_p \\not\\vDash p$ (i.e., $u_p \\notin V(p)$).\n2. $M,w \\not\\vDash \\Box q$: Similarly, there must exist at least one successor, which we will call $u_q$, such that $u_q \\in S_w$ and $M,u_q \\not\\vDash q$ (i.e., $u_q \\notin V(q)$).\n\nNow we use the condition $M,w \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$. This states that for any successor $u \\in S_w$, we have $M,u \\vDash p \\lor q$, which means $u \\in V(p)$ or $u \\in V(q)$.\n- Let's apply this to $u_p$. Since $u_p \\in S_w$ and we know $u_p \\notin V(p)$, it must be the case that $u_p \\in V(q)$.\n- Let's apply this to $u_q$. Since $u_q \\in S_w$ and we know $u_q \\notin V(q)$, it must be the case that $u_q \\in V(p)$.\n\nLet us examine the properties of the worlds $u_p$ and $u_q$:\n- At world $u_p$: $p$ is false ($u_p \\notin V(p)$) and $q$ is true ($u_p \\in V(q)$).\n- At world $u_q$: $p$ is true ($u_q \\in V(p)$) and $q$ is false ($u_q \\notin V(q)$).\n\nA world cannot simultaneously satisfy and not satisfy a proposition. Since the valuation of $p$ at $u_p$ (false) is different from the valuation of $p$ at $u_q$ (true), the worlds $u_p$ and $u_q$ must be distinct: $u_p \\neq u_q$.\n\nBoth $u_p$ and $u_q$ are members of the set of successors $S_w$. Since we have found two distinct members of $S_w$, the cardinality of this set must be at least $2$. That is, $|S_w| \\ge 2$.\n\nTo deduce that $|W| \\ge 2$: The set of all worlds $W$ is a superset of the set of successors of $w$, i.e., $S_w \\subseteq W$. Since we have proven $|S_w| \\ge 2$, it means there exist at least two distinct worlds in $S_w$. These worlds must also be in $W$, so $W$ must contain at least two distinct worlds. Therefore, $|W| \\ge 2$.\n\n**3. Minimal Possible Value of $|W|$**\n\nFrom Part 2, we have established a necessary condition for any such countermodel: the total number of worlds $|W|$ must be at least $2$. To find the minimal value, we must check if a model with $|W|=2$ can be constructed. If it can, then the minimum is $2$.\n\nLet's attempt to build a countermodel with $W = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$.\nLet the designated world be $w_1$. From the proof in Part 2, we know that the set of successors of $w_1$, denoted $S_{w_1}$, must satisfy $|S_{w_1}| \\ge 2$. Since $S_{w_1} \\subseteq W = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$, the only way to satisfy this is if $S_{w_1} = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$.\nThis forces the accessibility relation $R$ to contain at least $(w_1, w_1)$ and $(w_1, w_2)$. Let's define $R = \\{(w_1, w_1), (w_1, w_2)\\}$.\n\nThe proof in Part 2 also identified two distinct successors: one ($u_p$) where $p$ is false and $q$ is true, and another ($u_q$) where $p$ is true and $q$ is false. Let's assign these roles to the two available successors, $w_1$ and $w_2$.\n- Let $w_1$ be the successor where $p$ is false and $q$ is true. This sets $w_1 \\notin V(p)$ and $w_1 \\in V(q)$.\n- Let $w_2$ be the successor where $p$ is true and $q$ is false. This sets $w_2 \\in V(p)$ and $w_2 \\notin V(q)$.\n\nThis defines the valuation: $V(p) = \\{w_2\\}$ and $V(q) = \\{w_1\\}$.\n\nLet's verify this 2-world model: $M=(W,R,V)$ with $W=\\{w_1,w_2\\}$, $R=\\{(w_1,w_1), (w_1,w_2)\\}$, $V(p)=\\{w_2\\}$, $V(q)=\\{w_1\\}$, and designated world $w_1$.\n- Check $M,w_1 \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$: The successors of $w_1$ are $w_1$ and $w_2$.\n  - At $w_1$: $w_1 \\in V(q) \\implies M,w_1 \\vDash q \\implies M,w_1 \\vDash p \\lor q$.\n  - At $w_2$: $w_2 \\in V(p) \\implies M,w_2 \\vDash p \\implies M,w_2 \\vDash p \\lor q$.\n  The condition holds for all successors. So, $M,w_1 \\vDash \\Box(p \\lor q)$ is true.\n- Check $M,w_1 \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$:\n  - $M,w_1 \\not\\vDash \\Box p$ requires a successor where $p$ is false. The successor $w_1$ has $w_1 \\notin V(p)$, so this is satisfied.\n  - $M,w_1 \\not\\vDash \\Box q$ requires a successor where $q$ is false. The successor $w_2$ has $w_2 \\notin V(q)$, so this is satisfied.\n  Both parts of the disjunction fail, so $M,w_1 \\not\\vDash \\Box p \\lor \\Box q$ is true.\n\nSince a countermodel with $|W|=2$ exists, and we have proven that any countermodel must have $|W| \\ge 2$, the minimal possible value of $|W|$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3046692"}, {"introduction": "While constructing countermodels can be an ad-hoc process, we can also use systematic methods to determine if any model for a formula exists at all.

The problem is set in standard normal modal logic ($K$) with Kripke semantics. All definitions provided are standard and correct. The tasks—deciding satisfiability via a tableau, constructing a model, and determining minimal model cardinality—are well-defined and formal problems within mathematical logic. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in its field, and objective. It is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be pursued.\n\nWe will use a labeled tableau method to determine satisfiability. The labels represent worlds in a Kripke model. A tableau branch is closed if it contains contradictory formulas at the same world, i.e., both $w : \\psi$ and $w : \\lnot \\psi$ for some world $w$ and formula $\\psi$. If all branches close, the initial formula is unsatisfiable. If at least one branch remains open after all rules have been applied, the formula is satisfiable. From an open branch, a satisfying Kripke model can be constructed.\n\nThe initial formula to be tested for satisfiability at a world $w_0$ is:\n$1. \\quad w_0 : \\Diamond p \\land \\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\land \\lnot \\Box q$\n\nWe apply the decomposition rule for conjunction ($\\land$):\n$2. \\quad w_0 : \\Diamond p \\quad$ (from $1$)\n$3. \\quad w_0 : \\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\quad$ (from $1$)\n$4. \\quad w_0 : \\lnot \\Box q \\quad$ (from $1$)\n\nThe formula $w_0 : \\lnot \\Box q$ is semantically equivalent to $w_0 : \\Diamond \\lnot q$. Applying the tableau rule for this $\\Diamond$-type formula requires introducing a world accessible from $w_0$ where $\\lnot q$ is true. Let us introduce a new world $w_1$:\n$5. \\quad w_0 R w_1 \\quad$ (from $4$, new world $w_1$)\n$6. \\quad w_1 : \\lnot q \\quad$ (from $4$)\n\nNext, we process the formula $w_0 : \\Diamond p$. This requires a world accessible from $w_0$ where $p$ is true. The problem statement allows us to use either a fresh successor or an existing accessible world. To find a minimal model, we should be economical with worlds. Let us test if an existing world can serve as the witness. We have two existing worlds: $w_0$ and $w_1$.\nTest 1: Use $w_1$. This would require adding $w_1: p$ to the branch.\nTest 2: Use $w_0$. This would require adding $w_0 R w_0$ and $w_0 : p$.\nLet's pursue Test 2, as it leads to a more constrained and thus more easily analyzed situation.

A world $w$ is in $V(\\pi)$ if the formula $w : \\pi$ is on the open branch for an atomic proposition $\\pi$.\nFrom $w_0 : p$ (line $8$) and $w_1 : \\lnot p$ (Branch B1), we have $V(p) = \\{w_0\\}$.\nFrom $w_0 : q$ (Branch B) and $w_1 : \\lnot q$ (line $6$), we have $V(q) = \\{w_0\\}$.\n\nSo, the model is $M = (W, R, V)$ where $W = \\{w_0, w_1\\}$, $R = \\{(w_0, w_0), (w_0, w_1)\\}$, $V(p) = \\{w_0\\}$, and $V(q) = \\{w_0\\}$.\nLet's verify that $M, w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond p \\land \\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\land \\lnot \\Box q$:\n1. $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond p$: True, because $w_0 R w_0$ and $w_0 \\in V(p)$, so $M, w_0 \\vDash p$.\n2. $M,w_0 \\vDash \\lnot \\Box q$: This is true if there exists a world $v$ such that $w_0 R v$ and $M,v \\not\\vDash q$. We have $w_0 R w_1$ and $w_1 \\notin V(q)$, so $M,w_1 \\not\\vDash q$. The condition is met.\n3. $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Box(p \\rightarrow q)$: This is true if for all worlds $v$ with $w_0 R v$, we have $M,v \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$. The successors are $w_0$ and $w_1$.\n   - For $v=w_0$: $M,w_0 \\vDash p$ and $M,w_0 \\vDash q$, so $M,w_0 \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$.\n   - For $v=w_1$: $M,w_1 \\not\\vDash p$, so $M,w_1 \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$ is vacuously true.\nAll three conjuncts are satisfied. The model is valid and has a cardinality of $|W|=2$.\n\nFinally, we must determine the minimal cardinality of such a model from first principles.\nLet a model $M=(W, R, V)$ and a world $w_0 \\in W$ satisfy the formula.\nThe truth of $\\Diamond p \\land \\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\land \\lnot \\Box q$ at $w_0$ requires:\n(i) $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond p$: there exists a world $w_p \\in W$ such that $w_0 R w_p$ and $M,w_p \\vDash p$.\n(ii) $M,w_0 \\vDash \\lnot \\Box q$: there exists a world $w_q \\in W$ such that $w_0 R w_q$ and $M,w_q \\vDash \\lnot q$.\n(iii) $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Box(p \\rightarrow q)$: for all worlds $v \\in W$ with $w_0 R v$, we have $M,v \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$.\n\nFrom (iii), the property $p \\rightarrow q$ must hold in the particular worlds $w_p$ and $w_q$:\n- At $w_p$: $M,w_p \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$. Since by (i) we have $M,w_p \\vDash p$, it must follow that $M,w_p \\vDash q$.\n- At $w_q$: $M,w_q \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$.\n\nSo, we need an accessible world $w_p$ where $p \\land q$ is true, and an accessible world $w_q$ where $\\lnot q$ is true.\nCan $w_p$ and $w_q$ be the same world? If $w_p = w_q$, this world would have to satisfy both $q$ and $\\lnot q$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $w_p$ and $w_q$ must be distinct worlds: $w_p \\neq w_q$.\n\nThese worlds, $w_p$ and $w_q$, must be accessible from $w_0$. If both are distinct from $w_0$, we would need at least 3 worlds: $\\{w_0, w_p, w_q\\}$. This leads to a 3-world model, which we know is possible. However, the question is about the minimum.\n\nWhat is the lowest possible cardinality for $W$?\n- Can $|W|=1$? Let $W = \\{w_0\\}$. To satisfy the $\\Diamond$ and $\\lnot \\Box$ clauses non-vacuously, we need $w_0 R w_0$.\n  - $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Diamond p \\implies M,w_0 \\vDash p$.\n  - $M,w_0 \\vDash \\lnot \\Box q \\implies M,w_0 \\not\\vDash q$.\n  - $M,w_0 \\vDash \\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\implies M,w_0 \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$.\n  From $M,w_0 \\vDash p$ and $M,w_0 \\vDash p \\rightarrow q$, we deduce $M,w_0 \\vDash q$. This contradicts $M,w_0 \\not\\vDash q$. Thus, a model with $|W|=1$ is impossible.\n\nThe minimum cardinality must be at least $2$. We have already constructed and verified a model with $|W|=2$.\nTherefore, the minimal cardinality $|W|$ among all Kripke models of system $K$ in which the formula is true at some world is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3046657"}]}
