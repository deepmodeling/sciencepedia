It is a well-defined exercise in applying the Kripke semantics for intuitionistic propositional logic, a standard topic in mathematical logic.

The Kripke frame is given by the set of worlds $W = \\{w_0, w_1, w_2\\}$ with the partial order defined by the chain $w_0 \\leq w_1 \\leq w_2$. The valuation for the atomic proposition $p$ is given as $V(p) = \\{w_2\\}$.\n\nFirst, let's verify that the valuation $V(p) = \\{w_2\\}$ is monotone. A valuation $V(p)$ is monotone if for any $w \\in V(p)$ and any $v \\in W$ such that $w \\leq v$, we have $v \\in V(p)$. In this model, the only element in $V(p)$ is $w_2$. The only world $v$ such that $w_2 \\leq v$ is $w_2$ itself. Since $w_2 \\in V(p)$, the condition is satisfied.
