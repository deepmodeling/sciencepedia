This is denoted as $\\llbracket f(f(x,c),y)\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}$. The computation is based on the recursive definition of term interpretation, often referred to as Tarski's semantics.\n\nThe given components are:\n- Language $L = \\{f^{2}, c\\}$, with $f$ a binary function symbol and $c$ a constant symbol.\n- Structure $\\mathcal{M}$ with domain $M = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- Interpretation of $c$: $c^{\\mathcal{M}} = 0$.\n- Interpretation of $f$: $f^{\\mathcal{M}}(a, b) = a$ for all $a, b \\in M$.\n- Variable assignment $g$: $g(x) = 2$ and $g(y) = 1$.\n\nThe interpretation of a term $t$ in a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ under an assignment $g$, denoted $\\llbracket t \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}$, is defined recursively as follows:\n1. If $t$ is a variable $v$, then $\\llbracket v \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = g(v)$.\n2. If $t$ is a constant symbol $k$, then $\\llbracket k \\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = k^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n3.

Since $y$ is a variable, we apply rule $1$:\n$$ \\llbracket y\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = g(y) = 1 $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the nested term $\\llbracket f(x,c)\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}$. This is again a function application, so we use rule $3$:\n$$ \\llbracket f(x,c)\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = f^{\\mathcal{M}}(\\llbracket x\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}, \\llbracket c\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}) $$\n\nWe need to evaluate the denotations of its arguments, $\\llbracket x\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}$ and $\\llbracket c\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}$.\n- For the variable $x$, we use rule $1$: $\\llbracket x\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = g(x) = 2$.\n- For the constant symbol $c$, we use rule $2$: $\\llbracket c\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = c^{\\mathcal{M}} = 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the expression for $\\llbracket f(x,c)\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g}$:\n$$ \\llbracket f(x,c)\\rrbracket^{\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = f^{\\mathcal{M}}(2, 0) $$\nThe problem defines the interpretation of $f$ as $f^{\\mathcal{M}}(a,b) = a$.

The language is $\\mathcal{L}=\\{+,0\\}$, the structure is $\\mathcal{M}=(\\mathbb{Z},+^{\\mathcal{M}},0^{\\mathcal{M}})$ where the domain is the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, $+^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is standard addition, and $0^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is the integer $0$. The sentence is $\\varphi \\equiv \\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\bigl(x = y + y\\bigr)$.\n\nWe proceed by applying Tarski's recursive definition of truth for a first-order formula in a structure. A sentence, being a formula with no free variables, is true in a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ if it is satisfied by any (and thus every) variable assignment. A variable assignment is a function $s$ from the set of variables to the domain of the structure, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe sentence $\\varphi$ has the form $\\forall x \\, \\psi(x)$, where $\\psi(x)$ is the formula $\\exists y\\,\\bigl(x = y + y\\bigr)$.\nAccording to Tarski's semantics for the universal quantifier, $\\mathcal{M} \\vDash \\forall x \\, \\psi(x)$ if and only if for every element $a$ in the domain $\\mathbb{Z}$, the formula $\\psi(x)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$ under any variable assignment that maps $x$ to $a$. Let's denote such an assignment by $s_a$, where $s_a(x) = a$. So we must check if $\\mathcal{M} \\vDash \\psi(x)[s_a]$ for all $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet us fix an arbitrary element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We now need to determine the truth value of the subformula $\\psi(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\,\\bigl(x = y + y\\bigr)$ under the assignment $s_a$. This formula has the form $\\exists y \\, \\chi(x,y)$, where $\\chi(x,y)$ is the atomic formula $x = y + y$.\n\nAccording to Tarski's semantics for the existential quantifier, $\\mathcal{M} \\vDash (\\exists y \\, \\chi(x,y))[s_a]$ if and only if there exists an element $b$ in the domain $\\mathbb{Z}$ such that the formula $\\chi(x,y)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$ under an assignment that maps $x$ to $a$ and $y$ to $b$. Let's denote this new assignment by $s_{a,b}$.\n\nSo, for our fixed $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must determine if there exists a $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\vDash (x = y + y)[s_{a,b}]$.\n\nThe formula $x = y + y$ is an atomic formula of the form $t_1 = t_2$. It is satisfied by the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ and assignment $s_{a,b}$ if the interpretation of term $t_1$ is identical to the interpretation of term $t_2$.\nLet's find the interpretations of the terms $x$ and $y+y$.\nThe interpretation of the term $t_1 \\equiv x$ under the assignment $s_{a,b}$ is the value assigned to $x$, which is $(x)^{\\mathcal{M}}[s_{a,b}] = s_{a,b}(x) = a$.\nThe interpretation of the term $t_2 \\equiv y+y$ is determined by the interpretations of its components. The function symbol $+$ is interpreted as standard addition $+^{\\mathcal{M}}$. The interpretation of the variable $y$ is $(y)^{\\mathcal{M}}[s_{a,b}] = s_{a,b}(y) = b$. Therefore, the interpretation of the term $y+y$ is:\n$$\n(y+y)^{\\mathcal{M}}[s_{a,b}] = (+)^{\\mathcal{M}}\\bigl((y)^{\\mathcal{M}}[s_{a,b}], (y)^{\\mathcal{M}}[s_{a,b}]\\bigr) = b +^{\\mathcal{M}} b = 2b\n$$\nThe atomic formula $x = y + y$ is therefore true under the assignment $s_{a,b}$ if and only if $a = 2b$.\n\nSynthesizing these steps, the original sentence $\\varphi \\equiv \\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\bigl(x = y + y\\bigr)$ is true in the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ if and only if the following mathematical statement about the integers holds:\n\"For every integer $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there exists an integer $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a = 2b$.\"\n\nThis statement is an assertion about the properties of the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. It claims that every integer is an even number (i.e., divisible by $2$). This property is required for $\\varphi$ to hold in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nHowever, this property is false for the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. The set $\\mathbb{Z}$ contains odd numbers. To demonstrate the falsity of the statement, we only need to provide a single counterexample. Let us choose the integer $a=1$. For the statement to hold for this choice of $a$, there would have to exist an integer $b$ such that $1 = 2b$. The unique solution to this equation in the field of rational numbers is $b = \\frac{1}{2}$. However, $\\frac{1}{2}$ is not an element of the domain $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, there is no integer $b$ that satisfies the condition for $a=1$.\n\nSince we have found an element $a=1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for which the formula $\\exists y\\,\\bigl(x = y + y\\bigr)$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$, the universally quantified sentence $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,\\bigl(x = y + y\\bigr)$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\vDash \\varphi$. The specific property of $\\mathbb{Z}$ responsible for this is the existence of odd integers. The sentence $\\varphi$ would only hold in a structure where every element in the domain is \"divisible by two\" by the structure's addition operation.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be encoded as $\\text{True}=1$ and $\\text{False}=0$.
