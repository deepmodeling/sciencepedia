In classical semantics, for a unary predicate symbol $P$ and an element $d\\in D$, the atomic formula $P(x)$ evaluated under an assignment sending $x$ to $d$ is true if and only if $d\\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, and false otherwise. The universal quantifier satisfies the semantic clause that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\forall x\\,\\varphi$ if and only if for every $d\\in D$, $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\varphi[d/x]$. The existential quantifier satisfies the semantic clause that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\exists x\\,\\varphi$ if and only if there exists $d\\in D$ such that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\varphi[d/x]$. Negation satisfies the clause that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\lnot\\psi$ if and only if it is not the case that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\psi$. We encode truth values as $1$ for true and $0$ for false.\n\nWe evaluate $P(x)$ at each $d\\in D$:\n- For $d=0$, since $0\\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, the instance $P(x)$ with $x$ assigned $0$ is false, so its value is $0$.\n- For $d=1$, since $1\\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, the instance $P(x)$ with $x$ assigned $1$ is true, so its value is $1$.\n- For $d=2$, since $2\\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, the instance $P(x)$ with $x$ assigned $2$ is true, so its value is $1$.\n\nUsing the universal quantifier clause, $\\forall x\\,P(x)$ is true if and only if $P(x)$ is true for every $d\\in D$. Because $P(x)$ is false at $d=0$, $\\forall x\\,P(x)$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$, hence $v_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\forall x\\,P(x))=0$.\n\nFor the existential quantifier with negation, consider $\\exists x\\,\\lnot P(x)$. This statement is true if and only if there exists $d\\in D$ such that $\\lnot P(x)$ is true when $x$ is assigned $d$, which occurs exactly when $P(x)$ is false at that $d$.

Consider the domain of discourse $D=\\mathbb{Z}$, the set of all integers. An $\\mathcal{L}$-structure is specified by assigning each symbol of $\\mathcal{L}$ a denotation in $D$ and its appropriate Cartesian powers, according to Tarskian semantics for First-Order Logic (FOL). Construct the following interpretation $I$ on $D$: assign $I(c)=0$, assign $I(f)$ to be the successor function on integers given by $I(f)(n)=n+1$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, and assign $I(R)$ to be the binary relation on $\\mathbb{Z}$ given by $I(R)=\\{(m,n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2} : m<n\\}$.

If it is true, produce a single $\\mathcal{L}$-term $t(x)$ that, under the interpretation $I$, witnesses the existential quantifier in the sense that $R(x,t(x))$ holds for all $x\\in D$.

We will use the Tarskian semantics for first-order logic.\n\nThe notation $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi$ signifies that the sentence $\\psi$ is true in the structure $\\mathcal{M}$. A sentence with free variables is evaluated with respect to a variable assignment function $v$ which maps variables to elements of the domain $D$.\n\nThe sentence $\\forall x\\, \\exists y\\, R(x,y)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$ if, for every element $d \\in D$, the formula $\\exists y\\, R(x,y)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$ under any variable assignment $v$ such that $v(x) = d$.\nLet us choose an arbitrary integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and let $v$ be a variable assignment such that $v(x)=n$. We must determine if $\\mathcal{M}, v \\models \\exists y\\, R(x,y)$.\n\nAccording to the semantics of the existential quantifier, $\\mathcal{M}, v \\models \\exists y\\, R(x,y)$ is true if there exists some element $m \\in D = \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}, v' \\models R(x,y)$, where $v'$ is a variable assignment that is identical to $v$ everywhere except that $v'(y)=m$.\n\nThe satisfaction of an atomic formula like $R(x,y)$ is defined by the interpretation of the relation symbol. $\\mathcal{M}, v' \\models R(x,y)$ is true if and only if the tuple of the interpretations of its arguments is in the interpretation of the relation symbol. That is, $(I_{v'}(x), I_{v'}(y)) \\in I(R)$.\nThe interpretation of a variable under an assignment is the value assigned to it: $I_{v'}(x) = v'(x)$ and $I_{v'}(y) = v'(y)$.\nBy our setup, $v'(x) = v(x) = n$ and $v'(y)=m$. So, the condition becomes $(n, m) \\in I(R)$.\n\nThe interpretation of the relation symbol $R$ is given as $I(R) = \\{(a,b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 : a<b\\}$. Thus, the condition $(n,m) \\in I(R)$ is equivalent to the inequality $n < m$.\n\nSo, for our arbitrary integer $n$, we must show that there exists an integer $m$ such that $n < m$. For any integer $n$, we can choose $m = n+1$. Since $n < n+1$ is true for all integers $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and $n+1$ is always an integer, such an $m$ always exists in the domain $D=\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince for any arbitrary choice $n$ for $x$, we can find a suitable $m$ for $y$, the sentence $\\forall x\\, \\exists y\\, R(x,y)$ is true in the structure $(\\mathbb{Z}, I)$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to find a witnessing term $t(x)$. This is a term in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ involving the variable $x$ such that the formula $\\forall x\\, R(x, t(x))$ is true in the structure. This means that for any assignment $v$ where $v(x)=n$, the pair $(I_v(x), I_v(t(x)))$ must be in $I(R)$. This is the condition $(n, I_v(t(x))) \\in I(R)$, which translates to $n < I_v(t(x))$.\n\nWe need to construct a term $t(x)$ whose interpretation for any input $n$ is an integer greater than $n$. Our analysis showed that $n+1$ is such an integer. We now need to represent the operation $n \\mapsto n+1$ using the symbols of $\\mathcal{L}$. The language provides a unary function symbol $f$, whose interpretation $I(f)$ is the successor function: $I(f)(k) = k+1$ for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's consider the term $f(x)$. The interpretation of this term under an assignment $v$ where $v(x)=n$ is given by:\n$$I_v(f(x)) = I(f)(I_v(x)) = I(f)(v(x)) = I(f)(n) = n+1.$$\nNow we verify if $R(x, f(x))$ holds for all $x$. For any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must check if $(n, n+1) \\in I(R)$. This is equivalent to checking if the inequality $n < n+1$ holds. This inequality is a fundamental property of the integers and is true for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, the term $t(x) = f(x)$ satisfies the condition that $\\forall x\\, R(x, t(x))$ is true in the given structure. This term is constructed from the symbols available in $\\mathcal{L}$ and serves as the required witnessing term for the existential quantifier.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{f(x)}$$", "id": "3040610"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice elevates the perspective from analyzing single structures to classifying them based on their fundamental properties.

A theory $T$ is given that asserts the domain of discourse has exactly two elements. Concretely, the axiom $$\\exists x \\exists y \\big(x \\neq y \\land \\forall z\\, (z = x \\lor z = y)\\big)$$ ensures that in any model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T$, the universe $M$ must have cardinality $|M| = 2$. The interpretation of the predicate $P$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ is a subset $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\subseteq M$. Therefore, a model of $T$ is determined by a choice of $M$ with $|M| = 2$, together with a choice of subset $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\subseteq M$.\n\nThe isomorphism relation between structures is defined as follows: two structures $\\mathcal{M} = (M, P^{\\mathcal{M}})$ and $\\mathcal{N} = (N, P^{\\mathcal{N}})$ are isomorphic if there exists a bijection $f: M \\to N$ such that for every $a \\in M$, $$a \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\iff f(a) \\in P^{\\mathcal{N}}.$$ In the finite context where $|M| = |N| = 2$, any bijection is a permutation of the two elements. The isomorphism type therefore depends only on the abstract pattern of membership in $P$, not on the specific labels of elements.\n\nBecause $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is a subset of a two-element set, the possible cardinalities of $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ are $$|P^{\\mathcal{M}}| \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}.$$ We analyze each case and show that each cardinality corresponds to a single isomorphism type.\n\n- Case $|P^{\\mathcal{M}}| = 0$: Here $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\varnothing$. Any two models with empty interpretation of $P$ are isomorphic, since any bijection between the universes vacuously preserves membership in $P$. Therefore, there is exactly one isomorphism type in this case.\n\n- Case $|P^{\\mathcal{M}}| = 1$: Here $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is a singleton subset of $M$. Let $M = \\{a, b\\}$ and suppose $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{a\\}$.

Therefore, all models with $|P^{\\mathcal{M}}| = 1$ are isomorphic to each other, and there is exactly one isomorphism type in this case.\n\n- Case $|P^{\\mathcal{M}}| = 2$: Here $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = M$. Again, any bijection between universes preserves the fact that all elements are in $P$, so there is exactly one isomorphism type in this case.\n\nThere are no other possibilities for $|P^{\\mathcal{M}}|$ because $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is a subset of a set of cardinality $2$.
