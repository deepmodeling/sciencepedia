We write $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi$ if $\\phi$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$, and $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\phi$ otherwise.\n\nAccording to the Tarskian semantics for first-order logic, an existential sentence $\\exists x\\, \\psi(x)$ is true in a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ if and only if there exists at least one element $a$ in the universe of $\\mathcal{M}$ (denoted $U_{\\mathcal{M}}$) such that the subformula $\\psi(x)$ is satisfied in $\\mathcal{M}$ when the variable $x$ is assigned the value $a$.

Since this is a closed term (contains no variables), its interpretation is independent of the assignment $s$.\nThe interpretation of the constant symbol $0$ is given as $0^{\\mathcal{M}} = 0$.\nThe interpretation of the term $S(0)$ is computed by applying the interpretation of the function $S$ to the interpretation of its argument:\n$$ (S(0))^{\\mathcal{M}} = S^{\\mathcal{M}}(0^{\\mathcal{M}}) = S^{\\mathcal{M}}(0) = 0+1 = 1 $$\nSimilarly, the interpretation of the term $S(S(0))$ is:\n$$ (S(S(0)))^{\\mathcal{M}} = S^{\\mathcal{M}}((S(0))^{\\mathcal{M}}) = S^{\\mathcal{M}}(1) = 1+1 = 2 $$\n\nNext, let's evaluate the interpretation of the term $t_1 = S(x)$ under the assignment $s$ where $s(x)=a$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nThe interpretation of the variable $x$ under this assignment is $x^{\\mathcal{M},s} = s(x) = a$.\nThe interpretation of the term $S(x)$ is therefore:\n$$ (S(x))^{\\mathcal{M},s} = S^{\\mathcal{M}}(x^{\\mathcal{M},s}) = S^{\\mathcal{M}}(a) = a+1 $$\n\nThe satisfaction condition for the subformula $\\psi(x)$ thus reduces to finding an element $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that the following equality holds:\n$$ (S(x))^{\\mathcal{M},s} = (S(S(0)))^{\\mathcal{M}} $$\n$$ a+1 = 2 $$\nSolving this equation for $a$ yields $a=1$.\n\nThe element $a=1$ is a member of the universe $\\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, there exists an element in the universe of $\\mathcal{M}$ that satisfies the condition. This element, $1$, is the *witness* for the existential quantifier.\n\nThe mechanism of witnessing, as per the Tarskian definition, involves an assignment update. Starting with the empty assignment (as is standard for sentences), we test for the satisfaction of the existentially quantified formula. This requires finding an extension of the current assignment. In this case, we extend the empty assignment $\\emptyset$ to a new assignment $s = \\emptyset[x \\mapsto 1]$, which is simply the assignment mapping the variable $x$ to the element $1 \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Under this new assignment $s$, the formula $S(x)=S(S(0))$ is satisfied in $\\mathcal{M}$ because its left side evaluates to $S^{\\mathcal{M}}(s(x)) = S^{\\mathcal{M}}(1) = 2$ and its right side evaluates to $S^{\\mathcal{M}}(S^{\\mathcal{M}}(0^{\\mathcal{M}})) = 2$. Since $2=2$, the atomic formula is true under this assignment.\n\nBecause such a witness exists, the sentence $\\exists x\\,(S(x)=S(S(0)))$ is true in the structure $\\mathcal{M}$.\nThe problem requires the truth value to be represented numerically, with $1$ for true.\n\nThus, the truth value of the sentence is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3046886"}, {"introduction": "The power of logic lies in its ability to handle variables and general statements, but this requires careful rules for substitution.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "Let us proceed with the solution, addressing each of the three tasks.\n\nThe initial components are:\n- The language $\\mathcal{L}$ with a unary function symbol $f$ and a binary relation symbol $R$.\n- The formula $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists y\\, R(x,y)$.\n- The term to be substituted $t \\equiv f(y)$.\n- The variable to be replaced is $x$.\n\nThe substitution operation is denoted as $\\varphi[t/x]$.\n\n**Part 1: Capture-Avoiding Substitution**\n\nThe formal definition of capture-avoiding substitution, for a formula of the form $\\exists v\\, \\psi$, is as follows:\n$(\\exists v\\, \\psi)[t/x] = \\begin{cases}\n    \\exists v\\, \\psi  \\text{if } x = v \\\\\n    \\exists v\\, (\\psi[t/x])  \\text{if } x \\neq v \\text{ and } v \\notin Var(t) \\\\\n    \\exists v'\\, ((\\psi[v'/v])[t/x])  \\text{if } x \\neq v \\text{ and } v \\in Var(t)\n\\end{cases}$\nwhere $v'$ is a fresh variable that does not appear in $t$ or $\\psi$, and $Var(t)$ is the set of variables appearing in term $t$. The notation $\\psi[v'/v]$ denotes the substitution of $v'$ for $v$ in $\\psi$. The third case is the one that avoids variable capture by renaming the bound variable.\n\nIn our problem, we need to compute $(\\exists y\\, R(x,y))[f(y)/x]$.\n- The variable being replaced is $x$.\n- The bound variable in the quantifier is $y$. Since $x \\neq y$, we are not in the first case.\n- The term being substituted is $t \\equiv f(y)$. The set of variables in this term is $Var(t) = \\{y\\}$.\n- The bound variable $y$ is in $Var(t)$. Therefore, we are in the third case, which requires renaming the bound variable to avoid capture.\n\nTo avoid capture, we must perform an $\\alpha$-conversion on $\\varphi$. We rename the bound variable $y$ to a fresh variable, say $z$, which does not appear in $\\varphi$ or $t$. The formula $\\varphi$ is logically equivalent to $\\varphi' \\equiv \\exists z\\, R(x,z)$.\n\nNow we can perform the substitution on $\\varphi'$:\n$\\varphi'[t/x] \\equiv (\\exists z\\, R(x,z))[f(y)/x]$.\nHere, the variable being replaced is $x$ and the bound variable is $z$. The term is $t \\equiv f(y)$, so $Var(t) = \\{y\\}$. Since $z \\notin Var(t)$, we are in the second case of the substitution definition. We can substitute inside the quantifier's scope without renaming.\n$(\\exists z\\, R(x,z))[f(y)/x] = \\exists z\\, (R(x,z)[f(y)/x])$.\n\nThe substitution $R(x,z)[f(y)/x]$ simply replaces the free occurrence of $x$ in $R(x,z)$ with the term $f(y)$, yielding $R(f(y),z)$.\n\nThus, the result of the capture-avoiding substitution is $\\exists z\\, R(f(y),z)$.\n\n**Part 2: Failure of Naive Substitution and Variable Capture**\n\nNaive substitution ignores the rules of variable binding and simply replaces all free occurrences of the target variable.\nApplying naive substitution of $t \\equiv f(y)$ for $x$ in $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists y\\, R(x,y)$ results in:\n$\\exists y\\, R(f(y),y)$.\n\nThis substitution fails because it leads to variable capture, which fundamentally alters the meaning of the formula.\n1.  **How Capture Occurs**: The original formula $\\varphi$ has one free variable, $x$, so its set of free variables is $FV(\\varphi) = \\{x\\}$. The term $t \\equiv f(y)$ contains the variable $y$, which is free within the context of the term itself. When the term $t$ is substituted into the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$, the free variable $y$ from the term becomes bound by this quantifier. The variable $y$ from the term has been \"captured\".\n\n2.  **Change in Free Variables**: The resulting formula from naive substitution is $\\varphi_{naive} \\equiv \\exists y\\, R(f(y),y)$. In this formula, every occurrence of $y$ is under the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$. Therefore, $y$ is a bound variable. There are no free variables in this formula, so $FV(\\varphi_{naive}) = \\emptyset$. A formula with no free variables is called a sentence. The substitution has incorrectly transformed a formula with a free variable (whose truth depends on an assignment to $x$) into a sentence (whose truth is absolute within a given structure).\n\n3.  **Change in Meaning**: The capture of the variable changes the formula's logical meaning.\n    -   The original formula $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists y\\, R(x,y)$ asserts a property about the object assigned to the free variable $x$. It states \"There exists some object $y$ that is related to $x$ via $R$.\"\n    -   The correctly substituted formula, $\\psi \\equiv \\exists z\\, R(f(y),z)$, asserts a property about the object assigned to the free variable $y$. It states \"There exists some object $z$ that is related to $f(y)$ via $R$.\" This is the intended meaning of instantiating the property of $\\varphi$ with the term $f(y)$.\n    -   The naively substituted formula, $\\varphi_{naive} \\equiv \\exists y\\, R(f(y),y)$, asserts a completely different statement. It states \"There exists some object $y$ such that $f(y)$ is related to $y$ itself via $R$.\" This is a self-referential property and its truth value is fixed within a structure, independent of any variable assignments. The intended connection to the free variable $y$ from the term $t$ has been lost.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation in the Structure $\\mathcal{M}$**\n\nWe are tasked with evaluating the truth value of the correctly substituted formula from Part 1 in the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ under the variable assignment $s$.\n\n-   The formula to evaluate is $\\psi \\equiv \\exists z\\, R(f(y),z)$.\n-   The structure $\\mathcal{M}$ has the domain $\\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of integers).\n-   The interpretation of the function symbol $f$ is $f^{\\mathcal{M}}(n) = n$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n-   The interpretation of the relation symbol $R$ is $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(u,v)$ holds if and only if $u=v+1$, for any $u,v \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n-   The variable assignment is $s$, with $s(y)=3$.\n\nWe need to determine if $\\mathcal{M}, s \\models \\exists z\\, R(f(y),z)$.\n\nBy the satisfaction definition for an existential quantifier, this statement is true if and only if there exists an element $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$) such that $\\mathcal{M}, s[z \\mapsto d] \\models R(f(y),z)$. Here, $s[z \\mapsto d]$ is the variable assignment that maps $z$ to $d$ and agrees with $s$ on all other variables.\n\nLet's evaluate the satisfaction of the atomic formula $R(f(y),z)$ under the assignment $s[z \\mapsto d]$. This holds if the pair of values corresponding to the terms $(f(y), z)$ is in the relation $R^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nFirst, we find the values of the terms under the assignment $s[z \\mapsto d]$:\n-   The value of the term $f(y)$ is $f^{\\mathcal{M}}(s[z \\mapsto d](y))$. Since $y \\neq z$, this is $f^{\\mathcal{M}}(s(y)) = f^{\\mathcal{M}}(3) = 3$.\n-   The value of the term $z$ is $s[z \\mapsto d](z) = d$.\n\nSo, we need to determine if there exists a $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(3, d)$ holds.\nAccording to the definition of $R^{\\mathcal{M}}$, the relation $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(3,d)$ holds if and only if $3 = d+1$.\n\nWe must check if the equation $3 = d+1$ has a solution for $d$ in the domain $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSolving for $d$:\n$d = 3 - 1$\n$d = 2$\n\nSince $d=2$ is an integer ($2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), such an element exists in the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$. We have found a \"witness\", $d=2$, that makes the statement true.\n\nTherefore, the formula $\\exists z\\, R(f(y),z)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$ under the assignment $s$.\nThe question asks for the answer to be $1$ for true and $0$ for false. The formula is true, so the answer is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3046913"}]}
