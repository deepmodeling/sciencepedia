Use the foundational definitions of free variables, bound variables, substitution, and variable capture in first-order logic to determine whether $t$ is free for $x$ in $\\varphi$. Your reasoning must start from the following base concepts:\n\n- The free variables of a term: the variables that occur in the term.\n- The free and bound occurrences of variables in a formula, and the scope of quantifiers.\n- The notion of substitution $\\varphi[x:=t]$ as the operation that replaces free occurrences of $x$ in $\\varphi$ by $t$.\n- The definition: a term $t$ is free for a variable $x$ in a formula $\\varphi$ if no variable occurring free in $t$ becomes bound as a result of performing the substitution $\\varphi[x:=t]$.

An equivalent and more direct way to check this condition is to verify that for every free occurrence of $x$ in $\\varphi$, it does not lie within the scope of a quantifier $\\forall z$ or $\\exists z$ where $z$ is a variable that occurs free in the term $t$.\n\nWe will proceed by systematically analyzing the components of the problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the term $t$:**\n    The term is given as $t \\equiv f(y)$. The set of variables occurring in this term is $\\{y\\}$. Since terms do not contain quantifiers, any variable occurring in a term is, by definition, a free variable. Therefore, the set of free variables in $t$, denoted $\\text{FV}(t)$, is $\\{y\\}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formula $\\varphi$:**\n    The formula is given as $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists y\\,\\big(P(x,y)\\land Q(y)\\big)$.\n    We must identify the free occurrences of the variable $x$ and the scope of quantifiers.\n    -   The formula contains a single quantifier, $\\exists y$. The scope of this quantifier is the subformula to its right, which is $\\big(P(x,y)\\land Q(y)\\big)$.\n    -   Inside this scope, the variable $y$ appears in $P(x,y)$ and $Q(y)$. These occurrences of $y$ are bound by the quantifier $\\exists y$.\n    -   The variable $x$ appears once in the formula, within the atomic formula $P(x,y)$. This occurrence of $x$ is not bound by any quantifier in $\\varphi$ (as the only quantifier binds $y$). Therefore, this occurrence of $x$ is free in $\\varphi$.\n\n3.  **Apply the condition for \"free for\":**\n    We will now apply the definition. We need to check if any free occurrence of $x$ in $\\varphi$ falls within the scope of a quantifier that binds a variable present in $\\text{FV}(t)$.\n\n    -   **Free variables in the term $t$**: From step 1, we found that $\\text{FV}(t) = \\{y\\}$. The only variable we need to be concerned about is $y$.\n    -   **Free occurrences of $x$ in $\\varphi$**: From step 2, we found a single free occurrence of $x$ in the subformula $P(x,y)$.\n    -   **Quantifier scopes**: The formula $\\varphi$ has one quantifier, $\\exists y$, whose scope is $\\big(P(x,y)\\land Q(y)\\big)$.\n\n    Now, we check the crucial condition: Does the free occurrence of $x$ lie within the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$? Yes, the subformula $P(x,y)$ containing the free $x$ is within the scope of $\\exists y$.\n\n    Next, does this quantifier, $\\exists y$, bind a variable that is free in the term $t$? The quantifier binds the variable $y$. And, as we established, the variable $y$ is indeed free in the term $t \\equiv f(y)$.\n\n    Since there is a free occurrence of $x$ in $\\varphi$ (in $P(x,y)$) that lies within the scope of a quantifier ($\\exists y$) which binds a variable ($y$) that is free in the term $t$, the condition for $t$ being free for $x$ in $\\varphi$ is violated.\n\n4.  **Demonstrate the Variable Capture:**\n    To make the reasoning concrete, let's observe what happens if we were to perform the substitution $\\varphi[x:=t]$, which means replacing the free occurrence of $x$ in $\\varphi$ with the term $t \\equiv f(y)$.\n    The original formula is $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists y\\,\\big(P(x,y)\\land Q(y)\\big)$.\n    Substituting $f(y)$ for $x$ yields the new formula:\n    $$ \\exists y\\,\\big(P(f(y),y)\\land Q(y)\\big) $$\n    In this new formula, the variable $y$ that was part of the term $f(y)$ has been placed inside the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$. This $y$, which was free in the term $t$, has been \"captured\" and is now bound by the existential quantifier. This capture alters the intended meaning of the substitution. The term $t$ was meant to be substituted for $x$, but its own variable $y$ has had its reference hijacked by a quantifier in $\\varphi$.\n\n    Therefore, because this variable capture occurs, the term $t$ is not free for $x$ in $\\varphi$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The term $t \\equiv f(y)$ is not free for the variable $x$ in the formula $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists y\\,\\big(P(x,y)\\land Q(y)\\big)$.

If such a situation, known as \"variable capture,\" would occur, the bound variable $v$ in $\\psi$ must first be renamed to a fresh variable via $\\alpha$-conversion.\n\nLet's analyze the potential for variable capture in the substitution $\\varphi[x:=t]$.\nThe set of variables in the term $t \\equiv f(y,z)$ is $Var(t) = \\{y, z\\}$.\nThe set of free variables in the formula $\\varphi$ is $FV(\\varphi)$. The variable $x$ is not bound by any quantifier in $\\varphi$, so it is free. The variable $z$ is bound by $\\forall z$, and the variable $y$ is bound by $\\exists y$.

The subformula $\\exists y\\,B(y,x)$ is part of $\\varphi$. The variable $x$ occurs free in this subformula, which is within the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$. A naive substitution would replace $x$ with $f(y,z)$, resulting in the $y$ from the term $t$ being captured by the quantifier $\\exists y$. This is also not permitted.\n\nTo avoid both instances of variable capture, we must perform $\\alpha$-conversion on $\\varphi$ to rename the bound variables $z$ and $y$. We choose fresh variables $z'$ and $y'$ that do not appear free in $\\varphi$ or $t$. Let's rename $z$ to $z'$ and $y$ to $y'$.\n\nFirst, we rename the bound variable $z$ in $\\varphi$:\n$\\varphi' \\equiv \\forall z'\\,\\bigl((A(x,z) \\rightarrow \\exists y\\,B(y,x))[z'/z]\\bigr)$\n$\\varphi' \\equiv \\forall z'\\,\\bigl(A(x,z') \\rightarrow \\exists y\\,B(y,x)\\bigr)$\nThe formula $\\varphi'$ is $\\alpha$-equivalent to $\\varphi$.\n\nNext, we rename the bound variable $y$ in $\\varphi'$.\n$\\varphi'' \\equiv \\forall z'\\,\\bigl(A(x,z') \\rightarrow (\\exists y\\,B(y,x))[y'/y]\\bigr)$\n$\\varphi'' \\equiv \\forall z'\\,\\bigl(A(x,z') \\rightarrow \\exists y'\\,(B(y,x)[y'/y])\\bigr)$\n$\\varphi'' \\equiv \\forall z'\\,\\bigl(A(x,z') \\rightarrow \\exists y'\\,B(y',x)\\bigr)$\nThe formula $\\varphi''$ is $\\alpha$-equivalent to $\\varphi$ and $\\varphi'$.\n\nNow, the substitution $\\varphi''[x:=t]$ can be performed without variable capture.

A variable occurrence in a formula is free if it is not within the scope of a quantifier binding that variable; otherwise it is bound. A substitution of a term $t$ for a variable $x$ in a formula $\\psi$, written $\\psi[x:=t]$, replaces all free occurrences of $x$ in $\\psi$ by $t$, leaving bound occurrences of $x$ unchanged. A substitution is capture-avoiding when no free variable in $t$ becomes bound as a result of the replacement; when $t$ is a closed term, it has no free variables and hence cannot be captured.\n\nStep 1: Identify free and bound occurrences of $x$ in $\\varphi(x)$. The formula is\n$$\n\\varphi(x) \\;:=\\; \\exists y\\;\\Big(\\,\\forall x\\,(x \\times y = y \\times x)\\;\\wedge\\; (x = y + y)\\;\\wedge\\; P(y)\\,\\Big).\n$$\nThere are two kinds of occurrences of $x$:\n- Inside the subformula $\\forall x\\,(x \\times y = y \\times x)$, the variable $x$ is bound by the quantifier $\\forall x$.\n- In the subformula $(x = y + y)$, the $x$ is free because it is not within the scope of any quantifier binding $x$.\n\nThus, $\\varphi$ has one free occurrence of $x$, namely in the conjunct $(x = y + y)$.\n\nStep 2: Prepare to substitute and avoid capture. The closed term is $t = s(s(s(s(s(s(0))))))$. Since $t$ is closed, it has no free variables, so no variable in $t$ can be captured. Nonetheless, to eliminate any notational ambiguity with repeated use of $x$ both as a bound and a free variable symbol, we apply a standard $\\alpha$-conversion (renaming of bound variables) to the inner universal quantifier.

The number $3$ is prime in the usual sense (its only positive divisors are $1$ and $3$).\n\nTherefore, taking $y = 3$ satisfies all three conjuncts:\n$$\n\\forall z\\,(z \\times 3 = 3 \\times z) \\text{ is true}, \\quad 6 = 3 + 3 \\text{ is true}, \\quad P(3) \\text{ is true}.\n$$\nHence the existential statement is true in $\\mathcal{N}$.\n\nStep 6: Encode the truth value numerically.
