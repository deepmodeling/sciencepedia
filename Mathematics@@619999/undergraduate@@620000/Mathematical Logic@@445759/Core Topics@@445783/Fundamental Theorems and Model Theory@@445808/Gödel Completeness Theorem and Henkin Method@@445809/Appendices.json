It is a well-posed question within the domain of first-order mathematical logic, based on standard and explicitly stated syntactic conventions. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the analysis.\n\nOur objective is to determine the number of distinct free variable symbols in the formula:\n$$\n\\forall x\\,\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\to P(y)\\bigr)\\land \\exists z\\,Q(f(z),x)\n$$\nTo do so, we must systematically analyze the scope of each quantifier to distinguish between bound and free occurrences of variables. An occurrence of a variable is bound if it falls within the scope of a quantifier that quantifies that same variable. An occurrence is free if it is not bound. A variable symbol is considered free in a formula if it has at least one free occurrence.\n\nThe overall structure of the formula is a conjunction, which we can denote as $\\Phi \\land \\Psi$, where:\n$$\n\\Phi \\equiv \\forall x\\,\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\to P(y)\\bigr)\n$$\n$$\n\\Psi \\equiv \\exists z\\,Q(f(z),x)\n$$\nThe set of free variables in the entire formula is the union of the sets of free variables in $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$. We will analyze each part separately.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the formula $\\Phi$:\n$$\n\\Phi \\equiv \\forall x\\,\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\to P(y)\\bigr)\n$$\nThe outermost operator is the universal quantifier $\\forall x$. Its scope is the entire expression that follows, which is enclosed in parentheses: $\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\to P(y)\\bigr)$. Therefore, any free occurrence of the variable $x$ within this parenthesized expression will be bound by $\\forall x$.\n\nLet us examine the subformula within the scope of $\\forall x$:\n$$\n\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\to P(y)\n$$\nAccording to the provided rules of precedence, quantifiers have higher precedence than logical connectives like $\\to$. This means the formula is parsed as:\n$$\n\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\bigr)\\to P(y)\n$$\nThe scope of the existential quantifier $\\exists y$ is only the immediately following formula, which is the atomic formula $R(x,y)$.\n- In the antecedent $\\exists y\\,R(x,y)$: The variable $y$ in $R(x,y)$ is bound by the quantifier $\\exists y$. The variable $x$ in $R(x,y)$ has no corresponding quantifier within this subformula, so it is free.\n- In the consequent $P(y)$: The variable $y$ occurs. This occurrence is *not* within the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$. Thus, this occurrence of $y$ is free.\n\nConsequently, in the implication $\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\bigr)\\to P(y)$, the set of free variables is the union of the free variables from the antecedent and the consequent. The free variable from the antecedent is $x$, and the free variable from the consequent is $y$. So, the set of free variables for this implication is $\\{x, y\\}$.\n\nNow, we return to the full formula $\\Phi = \\forall x\\,\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\to P(y)\\bigr)$. The quantifier $\\forall x$ binds the free occurrence of $x$ in the subformula $\\bigl(\\exists y\\,R(x,y)\\to P(y)\\bigr)$. The variable $y$, however, is not affected by the $\\forall x$ quantifier. Thus, the variable $y$ remains free in $\\Phi$. The set of free variables in $\\Phi$ is $\\{y\\}$.\n\nSecond, let us analyze the formula $\\Psi$:\n$$\n\\Psi \\equiv \\exists z\\,Q(f(z),x)\n$$\nThe structure is an existential quantifier $\\exists z$ followed by the atomic formula $Q(f(z),x)$. The scope of $\\exists z$ is $Q(f(z),x)$.\n- The variables occurring in the atomic formula $Q(f(z),x)$ are $z$ (within the term $f(z)$) and $x$.\n- The quantifier $\\exists z$ binds the occurrence of the variable $z$.\n- The variable $x$ is not bound by any quantifier within $\\Psi$. The scope of the quantifier $\\forall x$ from the first part of the conjunction, $\\Phi$, does not extend past the $\\land$ connective. Therefore, this occurrence of $x$ is free in $\\Psi$.\nThe set of free variables in $\\Psi$ is $\\{x\\}$.\n\nFinally, to find the set of all free variables in the original formula $\\Phi \\land \\Psi$, we take the union of the sets of free variables from each conjunct:\n$$\n\\text{FreeVars}(\\Phi \\land \\Psi) = \\text{FreeVars}(\\Phi) \\cup \\text{FreeVars}(\\Psi) = \\{y\\} \\cup \\{x\\} = \\{x, y\\}\n$$\nThe distinct free variable symbols are $x$ and $y$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and an excellent question on a core topic in mathematical logic. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe purpose of Henkin's method is to construct a model for a consistent theory $T$. The construction proceeds by extending the language $L$ with new constants and extending the theory $T$ with new axioms, called Henkin axioms, in a way that preserves consistency at each step.\n\nLet $T_0$ be a consistent theory in a language $L_0$. The process of Henkinization involves building a sequence of theories $T_0 \\subseteq T_1 \\subseteq \\dots$ and languages $L_0 \\subseteq L_1 \\subseteq \\dots$. To get from $L_i, T_i$ to $L_{i+1}, T_{i+1}$, one adds, for each sentence of the form $\\exists x \\, \\varphi(x)$ in the language $L_i$, a new \"witness\" constant $c_{\\exists x \\varphi}$ and a new axiom $\\exists x \\, \\varphi(x) \\to \\varphi(c_{\\exists x \\varphi})$. (A simpler but equivalent approach, as described in the problem, is to just add the axiom $\\varphi(c_{\\exists x \\varphi})$ if $\\exists x \\, \\varphi(x)$ is in the theory we are building). The crucial step is that these constants must be new, or \"fresh\".\n\nLet's analyze why freshness is necessary for preserving consistency. Suppose we have a consistent theory $T$ in a language $L$. We want to add a witness for a formula $\\exists x \\, \\varphi(x)$.\n\n**Case 1: Using a Fresh Constant**\n\nLet $c$ be a constant symbol not in $L$. We form the new theory $T' = T \\cup \\{\\varphi(c)\\}$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $T'$ is inconsistent. This means $T \\cup \\{\\varphi(c)\\} \\vdash \\bot$, where $\\bot$ represents a contradiction. By the Deduction Theorem, this implies $T \\vdash \\lnot \\varphi(c)$. Since $c$ is a new symbol that does not appear in $T$ or in the formula $\\varphi(x)$ (other than as a placeholder term for the free variable), it acts as a generic element. Therefore, if we can prove $\\lnot \\varphi(c)$ from $T$, we can universally generalize this conclusion. That is, $T \\vdash \\forall x \\, \\lnot \\varphi(x)$. This is logically equivalent to $T \\vdash \\lnot (\\exists x \\, \\varphi(x))$.\nSo, adding the witness axiom $\\varphi(c)$ for a fresh constant $c$ can only introduce an inconsistency if the theory $T$ already proves that no such witness exists (i.e., $T \\vdash \\lnot \\exists x \\, \\varphi(x)$). In the context of building a maximally consistent Henkin theory, we would only add a witness for $\\exists x \\, \\varphi(x)$ if that sentence is part of our consistent set, in which case $\\lnot \\exists x \\, \\varphi(x)$ cannot be derivable. Thus, using a fresh constant preserves consistency.\n\n**Case 2: Reusing an Existing Constant**\n\nNow, suppose we violate the freshness requirement. Let $c_0$ be a constant already in the language $L$. We try to use $c_0$ as a witness for $\\exists x \\, \\varphi(x)$ by adding the axiom $\\varphi(c_0)$ to $T$. The new theory is $T' = T \\cup \\{\\varphi(c_0)\\}$.\n\nThe problem is that the theory $T$ may already contain axioms that specify properties of the object denoted by $c_0$. For instance, $T$ could entail some sentence $\\psi(c_0)$. If the sentences $\\psi(x)$ and $\\varphi(x)$ are contradictory (e.g., if $\\varphi(x)$ is $\\lnot \\psi(x)$), then the new theory $T'$ will be inconsistent. $T'$ would entail both $\\psi(c_0)$ (from $T$) and $\\varphi(c_0)$ (the new axiom). If, for example, $\\varphi(c_0)$ is $\\lnot \\psi(c_0)$, then $T'$ entails $\\psi(c_0) \\land \\lnot \\psi(c_0)$, which is a contradiction.\n\nEssentially, by reusing an existing constant $c_0$, we are forcing the element denoted by $c_0$ to simultaneously satisfy all its pre-existing properties from $T$ AND the new witnessing property $\\varphi$. If these properties are incompatible, consistency is destroyed. This is precisely what using a fresh constant avoids; a new symbol has no prior commitments and is free to be interpreted as the required witness without generating a conflict.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Freshness is required because reusing a constant forces the specific element already denoted by that constant to satisfy the new witness property, which may contradict existing commitments about that element. For example, let $L=\\{P,\\ c\\}$ with a unary predicate $P$ and a constant $c$, and let $T_{0}=\\{P(c),\\ \\exists x\\, \\lnot P(x)\\}$. The theory $T_{0}$ is consistent (e.g., it has a model with two elements, interpreting $c$ as one element $a$ with $P(a)$ true and some other element $b$ with $\\lnot P(b)$). If one violates freshness by witnessing $\\exists x\\, \\lnot P(x)$ using the existing constant $c$, one adds $\\lnot P(c)$, and $T_{0} \\cup \\{\\lnot P(c)\\}$ becomes inconsistent because it contains both $P(c)$ and $\\lnot P(c)$. With a fresh constant $d$, by contrast, adding $\\lnot P(d)$ preserves consistency and permits model expansion.**\n\nThis option provides an excellent explanation that aligns perfectly with the derivation above. It correctly identifies the core problem: a potential contradiction between pre-existing properties of the reused constant and the new property being assigned to it. The example provided is clear, simple, and accurately demonstrates the failure.\n*   The theory $T_0 = \\{P(c), \\exists x \\, \\lnot P(x)\\}$ is consistent. A model is $D=\\{a_1, a_2\\}$, $c^M=a_1$, $P^M=\\{a_1\\}$. $M \\vDash P(c)$ since $a_1 \\in P^M$. $M \\vDash \\exists x \\, \\lnot P(x)$ since for $x=a_2$, $a_2 \\notin P^M$.\n*   Violating freshness by using $c$ as the witness for $\\exists x \\, \\lnot P(x)$ means adding the axiom $\\lnot P(c)$.\n*   The new theory $\\{P(c), \\exists x \\, \\lnot P(x), \\lnot P(c)\\}$ is blatantly inconsistent because it contains the contradictory pair of sentences $P(c)$ and $\\lnot P(c)$.\n*   The final remark about using a fresh constant $d$ is also correct. The theory $\\{P(c), \\exists x \\, \\lnot P(x), \\lnot P(d)\\}$ remains consistent.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Freshness is only needed when the language contains equality. In languages without $=$, reusing an existing constant as a witness is always safe because one cannot express that two terms denote distinct elements, so no contradictions can arise.**\n\nThis statement is false. The example given in option A does not use the equality symbol ($=$), yet it demonstrates how reusing a constant creates an inconsistency. The contradiction $P(c) \\land \\lnot P(c)$ is a logical contradiction and does not depend on the presence of an equality predicate in the language. Therefore, freshness is required even in languages without equality.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. By the compactness theorem, reusing an existing constant cannot introduce inconsistency: if the extended theory were inconsistent, some finite subset would be inconsistent, contradicting the fact that the original theory was consistent.**\n\nThis is a fallacious argument that misinterprets the compactness theorem. The compactness theorem states that a theory has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. If we add an axiom $\\sigma$ to a consistent theory $T$ to get $T' = T \\cup \\{\\sigma\\}$, and $T'$ turns out to be inconsistent, then by compactness (or more simply, by the definition of proof), there exists a finite subset of $T'$ that is inconsistent. This finite subset will be of the form $\\{\\tau_1, \\dots, \\tau_n, \\sigma\\}$ where $\\{\\tau_1, \\dots, \\tau_n\\} \\subseteq T$. The compactness theorem does not preclude this possibility. In the example from option A, the inconsistent finite subset is $\\{P(c), \\lnot P(c)\\}$. The fact that the original theory was consistent does not prevent a new axiom from creating a contradiction with one or more of the original axioms.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Skolemization eliminates the need for freshness in Henkin's method because Skolem functions can be defined using the symbols already present in the language without introducing new ones, and doing so cannot affect consistency.**\n\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, it conflates Henkin's method with Skolemization, which are distinct (though related) procedures. Second, and more importantly, the standard process of Skolemization itself *requires* the introduction of fresh function/constant symbols to replace existentially quantified variables. For a formula $\\forall x_1 \\dots \\forall x_n \\exists y \\, \\psi(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y)$, one introduces a new function symbol $f$ and replaces the formula with $\\forall x_1 \\dots \\forall x_n \\, \\psi(x_1, \\dots, x_n, f(x_1, \\dots, x_n))$. The preservation of equisatisfiability in Skolemization depends critically on the freshness of these new Skolem symbols, for exactly the same reasons that freshness is required in Henkin's method. Reusing an existing function symbol could easily introduce contradictions. The premise of the option is fundamentally flawed.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3042834"}]}
