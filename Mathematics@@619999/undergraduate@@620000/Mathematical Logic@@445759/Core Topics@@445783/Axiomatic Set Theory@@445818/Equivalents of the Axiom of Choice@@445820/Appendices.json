An **indexed family of sets** is a collection of sets $\\{A_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ where $I$ is a non-empty set called the index set.\n2.  The **Cartesian product** of this family, denoted by $\\prod_{i \\in I} A_i$, is the set of all functions $f: I \\to \\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i$ such that for every $i \\in I$, the condition $f(i) \\in A_i$ is satisfied.

Define $\\mathcal{C}=\\{A_{i}\\mid i\\in I\\}$ (a collection of the sets appearing in the family). By AC, there exists $g:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_{i}$ with $g(A)\\in A$ for each $A\\in \\mathcal{C}$.

Therefore A holds.\n\n(2) A implies AC:\nAssume A: For any indexed family of non-empty sets, the product is non-empty.\nLet $\\mathcal{C}$ be any collection of non-empty sets. Index $\\mathcal{C}$ by itself: let $I=\\mathcal{C}$ and define $A_{X}=X$ for each $X\\in I$. By assumption A, the product $\\prod_{X\\in \\mathcal{C}}A_{X}=\\prod_{X\\in \\mathcal{C}}X$ is non-empty. Thus there exists a function $f:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\bigcup_{X\\in \\mathcal{C}}X$ such that $f(X)\\in X$ for all $X\\in \\mathcal{C}$. This $f$ is precisely the choice function required by AC. Hence AC holds.\n\nTherefore, Statement A is logically equivalent to AC.\n\nNext, we analyze the remaining statements to determine whether they are equivalent to AC.\n\nStatement B: The Cartesian product of any finite indexed family of non-empty sets is non-empty.\nThis is provable in ZF without AC. For a finite index set, say $I=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, from $A_{k}\\neq \\varnothing$ for each $k$, one can successively choose $a_{1}\\in A_{1}$, then $a_{2}\\in A_{2}$, and so on, constructing the finite tuple $(a_{1},\\dots,a_{n})\\in \\prod_{k=1}^{n}A_{k}$ using standard constructions of ordered pairs and Cartesian products available in ZF. Hence B is strictly weaker than AC and not equivalent to it.\n\nStatement C: The product $\\prod_{i\\in I}A_{i}$ is non-empty if and only if $\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_{i}$ is non-empty.\nThe direction $\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_{i}\\neq \\varnothing \\Rightarrow \\prod_{i\\in I}A_{i}\\neq \\varnothing$ is true in ZF: a common element $a\\in \\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_{i}$ defines a constant choice function $f(i)=a$. The converse is false in general: a product can be non-empty even when the sets have empty intersection (e.g., two disjoint non-empty sets over a two-point index set have a non-empty product but empty intersection). Thus C is false and not equivalent to AC.\n\nStatement D: If the product $\\prod_{i\\in I}A_{i}$ is non-empty, then each $A_{i}$ is non-empty.\nThis is provable in ZF: if $f\\in \\prod_{i\\in I}A_{i}$, then for each $i$, $f(i)\\in A_{i}$, so each $A_{i}\\neq \\varnothing$. Therefore D is strictly weaker than AC and not equivalent to it.\n\nStatement E: For any indexed family of non-empty sets $\\{A_{i}\\}_{i\\in I}$, the union $\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_{i}$ contains at least one choice function for the family.\nThis statement is ill-typed and false as stated: a choice function for the family is a function $f:I\\to \\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_{i}$, i.e., a set of ordered pairs with domain $I$. Such a function is generally not an element of $\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_{i}$, which is a union of the individual elements of the $A_{i}$. The correct AC-equivalent formulation would state existence of a choice function, not that it belongs to the union.

The core of this problem is to determine under which conditions the converse holds, i.e., when a maximal element is also a maximum element.\n\n**A.

By definition of a maximal element, there is no $y \\in P$ such that $m  y$. To show that $m$ is a maximum element, we must prove that for any $x \\in P$, $x \\le m$.\nSince $P$ is totally ordered, for any $x \\in P$, we have either $x \\le m$ or $m \\le x$. If $m \\le x$ and $x \\ne m$, it would mean $m  x$. However, this is impossible because $m$ is a maximal element. Thus, the case $m  x$ cannot occur for any $x \\in P$. This leaves only the possibility that for any $x\\in P$, we have $x \\le m$. This is precisely the definition of a maximum element. Therefore, in a totally ordered set, any maximal element is also a maximum element.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $\\left(P,\\le\\right)$ is directed, then every maximal element of $P$ is a maximum element of $P$.**\n\nLet $(P, \\le)$ be a directed set and let $m \\in P$ be a maximal element. To show that $m$ is a maximum element, we must prove that for an arbitrary $x \\in P$, we have $x \\le m$.\nSince $P$ is a directed set, for the elements $m \\in P$ and $x \\in P$, there exists an element $z \\in P$ such that $m \\le z$ and $x \\le z$.\nBy definition, $m$ is a maximal element, which means there is no element $y \\in P$ such that $m  y$. The condition $m \\le z$ means that either $m=z$ or $mz$. As $m$ is maximal, the case $mz$ is ruled out. Therefore, we must have $m=z$.\nSubstituting $m$ for $z$ in the second condition from the directed property, $x \\le z$, we get $x \\le m$.\nSince $x$ was an arbitrary element of $P$, we have shown that for all $x \\in P$, $x \\le m$. This is the definition of a maximum element.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**C. If every chain in $\\left(P,\\le\\right)$ has an upper bound in $P$, then any maximal element of $P$ must be a maximum element of $P$.**\n\nThe hypothesis of this statement is the condition for Zorn's Lemma, which guarantees the existence of at least one maximal element. However, it does not imply that such a maximal element must be a maximum element. We can construct a counterexample.\nLet $P = \\{a, b\\}$ be a set with two elements. Define the partial order $\\le$ on $P$ to be the discrete order, where the only relations are $a \\le a$ and $b \\le b$. The elements $a$ and $b$ are not comparable.\nLet's check the hypothesis. The non-empty chains in $P$ are $C_1 = \\{a\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{b\\}$.\n- For the chain $C_1$, $a$ is an upper bound in $P$.\n- For the chain $C_2$, $b$ is an upper bound in $P$.\n- The empty set $\\emptyset$ is also a chain. Any element in $P$ is an upper bound for $\\emptyset$, so it has an upper bound.\nThus, every chain in $(P, \\le)$ has an upper bound in $P$.\nNow let's examine the maximal elements.\n- $a$ is a maximal element because there is no $y \\in P$ such that $a  y$.\n- $b$ is a maximal element because there is no $y \\in P$ such that $b  y$.\nSo, $P$ has maximal elements. Let's take one of them, say $a$. Is $a$ a maximum element? For $a$ to be a maximum element, it must be that for all $x \\in P$, $x \\le a$. This means we must have $b \\le a$, which is not true in our defined partial order. Thus, $a$ is not a maximum element. Similarly, $b$ is a maximal element but not a maximum element.\nThis provides a counterexample where the hypothesis holds, but the conclusion (that any maximal element is a maximum element) is false.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $\\left(P,\\le\\right)$ is a join-semilattice, then every maximal element of $P$ is a maximum element of $P$.**\n\nLet $(P, \\le)$ be a join-semilattice. This means that for any two elements $x, y \\in P$, their least upper bound (join), denoted $x \\vee y$, exists in $P$.\nLet's show that any join-semilattice is a directed set. For any $x, y \\in P$, let $z = x \\vee y$. By the definition of a least upper bound, $z$ is an upper bound for $\\{x, y\\}$, which means $x \\le z$ and $y \\le z$. This is exactly the definition of a directed set.\nSince every join-semilattice is a directed set, and we proved in part B that in a directed set every maximal element is a maximum element, the same must be true for any join-semilattice.\n\nFor completeness, here is the direct proof. Let $m \\in P$ be a maximal element. To show $m$ is a maximum element, we pick an arbitrary $x \\in P$ and show $x \\le m$.\nSince $P$ is a join-semilattice, the join $m \\vee x$ exists in $P$. By the definition of the join, $m \\le (m \\vee x)$.\nHowever, $m$ is a maximal element, so no element in $P$ can be strictly greater than $m$. Therefore, the relation $m \\le (m \\vee x)$ must imply $m = m \\vee x$.\nAlso by the definition of the join, $x$ is less than or equal to the least upper bound of $\\{m, x\\}$. That is, $x \\le m \\vee x$.\nSince we have established that $m = m \\vee x$, we can substitute to get $x \\le m$.\nAs $x$ was an arbitrary element of $P$, it follows that $m$ is a maximum element.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**E. If $\\left(P,\\le\\right)$ has at least one maximal element, then the maximal element is unique.**\n\nThis statement is false. A partially ordered set can have multiple maximal elements. The same counterexample used for statement C demonstrates this.\nConsider $P = \\{a, b\\}$ with the discrete order ($a \\le a$, $b \\le b$, and no other relations).\nAs shown before, both $a$ and $b$ are maximal elements.\n- $a$ is maximal since no element is strictly greater than $a$.\n- $b$ is maximal since no element is strictly greater than $b$.\nThe set $P$ has at least one maximal element (it has two), but the maximal element is not unique. A maximum element, if it exists, must be unique.

Then $S = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} S_i$ is a generating set for $U$. However, the chain $C$ can be infinite (i.e., the index set $I$ can be infinite). The union of an infinite number of finite sets is not necessarily finite. If $S$ is an infinite set, then we have only shown that $U$ is generated by $S$, not that $U$ is finitely generated.\n\nThe claim that $U$ is always finitely generated is false. This can be demonstrated with a counterexample. Consider the additive group of rational numbers, $G = (\\mathbb{Q}, +)$. Any finitely generated subgroup of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is of the form $\\langle \\frac{p_1}{q_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{p_k}{q_k} \\rangle$, which is cyclic and can be written as $\\langle \\frac{a}{b} \\rangle$ for some $\\frac{a}{b} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.

Now, consider the chain of subgroups $C = \\{H_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ where $H_n = \\langle \\frac{1}{n!} \\rangle$. Each $H_n$ is finitely (even singly) generated, so $H_n \\in P$. This is a chain because if $m \\le n$, then $n!$ is a multiple of $m!$, so $\\frac{1}{m!} \\in H_n$, which implies $H_m \\subseteq H_n$. The union is $U = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} H_n$. Any rational number $\\frac{p}{q}$ can be written as $\\frac{p(q-1)!}{q!}$, so it lies in $H_q$. Therefore, $U = \\mathbb{Q}$. However, the group $(\\mathbb{Q}, +)$ is not finitely generated. Thus, the union $U$ is not in the set $P$. This chain $C$ does not have an upper bound in $P$, so the hypothesis of Zorn's Lemma fails.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

A correct use of Zornâ€™s lemma in algebra is to consider the partially ordered set of linearly independent subsets of a vector space ordered by inclusion, where unions of chains remain linearly independent, yielding the existence of a basis.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the central flaw: the union of a chain of finitely generated subgroups is not necessarily finitely generated. It provides a perfect and standard counterexample. Let $G = \\bigoplus_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathbb{Z}$ be the direct sum of countably many copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$. $G$ is not finitely generated. Let $H_n = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{Z}$ be the subgroup consisting of sequences where only the first $n$ components can be non-zero. Each $H_n$ is generated by the first $n$ standard basis vectors, so it is finitely generated. The sequence of subgroups $\\{H_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ forms a chain under inclusion. Their union is $\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} H_n = G$, which is not finitely generated. This demonstrates that the hypothesis of Zorn's lemma is not met. The second part of the option correctly contrasts this with a valid use of Zorn's lemma (existence of a vector space basis), highlighting the key property required for the union to remain in the poset.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B.

First, it does not identify the error in the given argument but rather dismisses it as \"essentially correct\" and proposes a different, flawed argument. The concept of a \"minimal generating set\" for a general group is not sufficient to solve the problem; for the group $G = \\bigoplus_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathbb{Z}$, a minimal generating set is infinite. The existence of such a set does not imply the existence of a maximal *finitely generated* subgroup. The reasoning is a non-sequitur.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The error is confusing a maximal element with a maximum. Because there is no largest finitely generated subgroup, Zornâ€™s lemma cannot be used. If one could show a largest finitely generated subgroup exists, then Zornâ€™s lemma would apply and the argument would be repaired.**\n\nThis option fundamentally misrepresents Zorn's Lemma. The lemma's purpose is to prove the existence of *maximal* elements, not necessarily a *maximum* (largest) element. The lack of a maximum element does not preclude the use of Zorn's lemma; in fact, this is a common scenario for its application. The statement \"If one could show a largest finitely generated subgroup exists, then Zornâ€™s lemma would apply\" is backwards; if a largest element is known to exist, it is trivially a maximal element, and Zorn's lemma is unnecessary to prove its existence. The original argument did not confuse maximal with maximum.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The union argument fails only if the chain has infinitely many members. Restrict attention to chains of strictly increasing finitely generated subgroups; the union of finitely many finite generating sets is finite, so every such chain has a finitely generated upper bound. This suffices for Zornâ€™s lemma.**\n\nThis option correctly observes that the argument only fails for infinite chains. However, its proposed solution is fatally flawed. The hypothesis of Zorn's lemma must hold for *all* chains in the poset, not just finite ones or some other restricted class. Verifying the condition for finite chains is always trivial (the largest element of the finite chain is an upper bound) and is never sufficient to apply the lemma in a non-trivial case. The power and purpose of Zorn's lemma is precisely to handle the consequences of properties holding over infinite chains.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Reverse the order on $P$ by defining $H_1 \\preceq H_2$ if $H_2 \\subseteq H_1$. Then every chain has an upper bound given by the intersection of the chain, and intersections of finitely generated subgroups are finitely generated. Therefore Zornâ€™s lemma applies and yields a minimal finitely generated subgroup.**\n\nThis option proposes a different argument which is also flawed. The claim that \"intersections of finitely generated subgroups are finitely generated\" is false. A well-known counterexample is in the free group on two generators, $F_2 = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. The intersection of the finitely generated subgroups $\\langle a, bab^{-1} \\rangle$ and $\\langle b, aba^{-1} \\rangle$ is the commutator subgroup $[F_2, F_2]$, which is a free group of infinite rank and thus not finitely generated. Since the premise of this alternative argument is false, its conclusion that Zorn's lemma applies is invalid.
