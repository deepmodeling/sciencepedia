However, the explicit constraint \"Starting solely from $a, b, c, and d$\" and the restriction to only the Axioms of Pairing and Union clarify the intent. The only viable interpretation is that $a,b,c,d$ are the initial building blocks, not that the set $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ is given. If the set were given, the Axiom Schema of Separation would be needed to extract elements, which is forbidden.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved under the logical interpretation that the constructions start from the four individual sets $a, b, c, d$.\n\n### Construction and Calculation of $N_3$\n\nFirst, we provide an explicit construction of the set $\\{a,b,c\\}$ using a sequence of axiom applications. The starting sets are $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\n1.  Let $S_1 = \\{a, b\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the sets $a$ and $b$.\n2.  Let $S_2 = \\{c\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the set $c$ with itself, i.e., $\\{c,c\\}$.\n3.  Let $S_3 = \\{S_1, S_2\\} = \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c\\}\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, which were constructed in the previous steps.\n4.  Let $S_4 = \\bigcup S_3 = \\bigcup \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c\\}\\} = \\{a,b,c\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Union to the set $S_3$.\n\nThis sequence of 4 distinct axiom applications successfully constructs the set $\\{a,b,c\\}$. Therefore, the minimal number of applications, $N_3$, is at most $4$.\n\nTo prove that $N_3=4$, we must show that it is not possible to construct $\\{a,b,c\\}$ in fewer than $4$ steps.\n-   The set $\\{a,b,c\\}$ has $3$ elements. The Axiom of Pairing can create sets with at most $2$ distinct elements. Therefore, the final step in any construction of $\\{a,b,c\\}$ must be an application of the Axiom of Union.\n-   Let this final, $k^{th}$, step be the formation of $\\{a,b,c\\} = \\bigcup X$ for some set $X$. For this to be possible, the set $X$ must be available after $k-1$ steps.\n-   The set $X$ must be a set of sets, for instance $X=\\{A,B\\}$, such that $A \\cup B = \\{a,b,c\\}$. If $X$ were a singleton, say $X=\\{Y\\}$, then $\\bigcup X=Y$. This would imply $Y=\\{a,b,c\\}$, meaning the set we aim to construct must already exist before the final step, which is a contradiction. Thus, $X$ must have at least two elements.\n-   The simplest such set $X$ to construct is a pair, $X=\\{A,B\\}$. Creating $X$ via the Axiom of Pairing requires $1$ application, and this can only be done after both $A$ and $B$ are available.\n-   Let's consider the most efficient partition of $\\{a,b,c\\}$ into two sets, for example $A=\\{a,b\\}$ and $B=\\{c\\}$.\n-   The set $A=\\{a,b\\}$ is not one of the initial sets, so it must be constructed. This requires $1$ application of the Axiom of Pairing.\n-   The set $B=\\{c\\}$ is also not one of the initial sets. It must be constructed, requiring $1$ application of the Axiom of Pairing ($B = \\{c,c\\}$).\n-   To construct $X=\\{A,B\\}$, we need both $A$ and $B$ to be available. The construction of $A$ and $B$ requires a total of $2$ axiom applications.\n-   So, a minimal sequence of applications is as follows:\n    1.  Application 1: Construct $A=\\{a,b\\}$.\n    2.  Application 2: Construct $B=\\{c\\}$.\n    3.  Application 3: With $A$ and $B$ now available, construct $X=\\{A,B\\}$.\n    4.  Application 4: With $X$ now available, construct $\\bigcup X = \\{a,b,c\\}$.\n-   This timeline shows that a minimum of $4$ applications are necessary. At the end of $2$ steps, we can have $A$ and $B$. At the end of $3$ steps, we can have $X$. The final set $\\{a,b,c\\}$ can thus only be obtained at step $4$. Any other partition of $\\{a,b,c\\}$ (e.g., $A=\\{a\\}$ and $B=\\{b,c\\}$, or $A=\\{a,b\\}$ and $B=\\{a,c\\}$) leads to the same minimal count of $4$ steps.\n-   Therefore, $N_3 = 4$.\n\n### Construction and Calculation of $N_4$\n\nNext, we provide an explicit construction of the set $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. The starting sets are $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\n1.  Let $T_1 = \\{a, b\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing.\n2.  Let $T_2 = \\{c, d\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing.\n3.  Let $T_3 = \\{T_1, T_2\\} = \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c, d\\}\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Pairing to the sets $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n4.  Let $T_4 = \\bigcup T_3 = \\bigcup \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{c, d\\}\\} = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$. This set is constructed by one application of the Axiom of Union to the set $T_3$.\n\nThis sequence of 4 axiom applications constructs the set $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. Thus, $N_4 \\le 4$.\n\nTo prove $N_4 = 4$, we use the same reasoning as for $N_3$.\n-   The construction of a $4$-element set must terminate with the Axiom of Union. Let the final step be $\\{a,b,c,d\\} = \\bigcup X$.\n-   The set $X$ must be a set of sets, constructed in the preceding steps. As before, $X$ cannot be a singleton.\n-   The most efficient way to form $X$ is as a pair, $X=\\{A,B\\}$, where $A \\cup B = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$. This requires $1$ application of Pairing, once $A$ and $B$ are available.\n-   The most efficient partition of $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ is into two pairs, for instance $A=\\{a,b\\}$ and $B=\\{c,d\\}$.\n-   The construction of $A=\\{a,b\\}$ requires $1$ application of Pairing.\n-   The construction of $B=\\{c,d\\}$ requires $1$ application of Pairing.\n-   Thus, a total of $2$ applications are needed to have $A$ and $B$ available.\n-   The minimal sequence of applications is:\n    1.  Application 1: Construct $A=\\{a,b\\}$.\n    2.  Application 2: Construct $B=\\{c,d\\}$.\n    3.  Application 3: Construct $X=\\{A,B\\}$.\n    4.  Application 4: Construct $\\bigcup X = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$.\n-   This demonstrates that a minimum of a $4$ applications are necessary to construct $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$.\n-   Therefore, $N_4=4$.\n\nThe minimal number of axiom applications required to obtain $\\{a,b,c\\}$ is $N_3=4$. The minimal number of axiom applications required to obtain $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ is $N_4=4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3038052"}, {"introduction": "While axioms like Pairing and Union allow us to build sets, the Axiom Schema of Separation provides a crucial tool for defining subsets based on specific properties.

It requests the formulation of standard definitions and the computation of specific values using established principles of ordinal arithmetic. All terms used are precise and standard in the field.\n\nThe definitions for ordinal arithmetic operations are formulated using the Transfinite Recursion Theorem. This theorem allows for the definition of a function on the class of all ordinals, $\\mathrm{On}$, by specifying its value at an ordinal based on its values at all smaller ordinals. For an ordinal $\\beta$, we define the function's value $F(\\beta)$ in three cases: for $\\beta=0$, for $\\beta$ being a successor ordinal (i.e., $\\beta = \\gamma+1$), and for $\\beta$ being a limit ordinal.\n\n**1. Definition of Ordinal Multiplication**\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be ordinals. The product $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ is defined by transfinite recursion on $\\beta$:\n- **Base Case:** $\\alpha \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- **Successor Step:** For any ordinal $\\gamma$, $\\alpha \\cdot (\\gamma+1) = (\\alpha \\cdot \\gamma) + \\alpha$. The operation '$+$' denotes ordinal addition, which is itself defined recursively.\n- **Limit Step:** For any limit ordinal $\\lambda > 0$, $\\alpha \\cdot \\lambda = \\sup\\{\\alpha \\cdot \\gamma \\mid \\gamma < \\lambda\\}$.\n\nThe supremum of a set of ordinals is their union, so for a limit ordinal $\\lambda$, the definition is equivalent to $\\alpha \\cdot \\lambda = \\bigcup_{\\gamma < \\lambda} (\\alpha \\cdot \\gamma)$. This definition corresponds to the order type of the Cartesian product $\\alpha \\times \\beta$ with the anti-lexicographical (or reverse lexicographical) ordering.\n\n**2. Definition of Ordinal Exponentiation**\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be ordinals. The exponentiation $\\alpha^{\\beta}$ is defined by transfinite recursion on $\\beta$:\n- **Base Case:** $\\alpha^0 = 1$. (Note that $1 = \\{0\\}$).\n- **Successor Step:** For any ordinal $\\gamma$, $\\alpha^{\\gamma+1} = \\alpha^{\\gamma} \\cdot \\alpha$.\n- **Limit Step:** For any limit ordinal $\\lambda > 0$, $\\alpha^{\\lambda} = \\sup\\{\\alpha^{\\gamma} \\mid \\gamma < \\lambda\\}$.

The ordinal $2$ is the successor of $1$, i.e., $2 = 1+1$.\nWe apply the recursive definition of ordinal multiplication with $\\alpha = \\omega$ and $\\beta = 2$. Since $2$ is a successor ordinal, we use the successor step.\nLet $\\gamma=1$. Then $2 = 1+1$.\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega \\cdot (1+1) $$\nAccording to the successor-step definition:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot (1+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 1) + \\omega $$\nWe first need to evaluate $\\omega \\cdot 1$. We use the successor step again with $\\gamma=0$, so $1=0+1$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega \\cdot (0+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 0) + \\omega $$\nBy the base case definition, $\\omega \\cdot 0 = 0$.

Computation of $2^{\\omega}$**\nWe apply the recursive definition of ordinal exponentiation with $\\alpha = 2$ and $\\beta = \\omega$.\nSince $\\omega$ is a limit ordinal, we use the limit step of the definition:\n$$ 2^{\\omega} = \\sup\\{2^{\\gamma} \\mid \\gamma < \\omega\\} $$\nThe ordinals $\\gamma$ that are less than $\\omega$ are precisely the finite ordinals, which correspond to the natural numbers $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. So we can write:\n$$ 2^{\\omega} = \\sup_{n < \\omega} (2^{n}) $$\nLet's evaluate the first few terms of the set $\\{2^n \\mid n < \\omega\\}$:\n- $2^0 = 1$\n- $2^1 = 2^0 \\cdot 2 = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$\n- $2^2 = 2^1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\cdot 2 = 2+2=4$\n- $2^3 = 2^2 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\cdot 2 = 4+4=8$\nFor any finite ordinal $n$, the ordinal $2^n$ is equal to the corresponding natural number $2^n$.
