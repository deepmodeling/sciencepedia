Our primary tool will be a recursive formula for the rank of a set, which we first derive from the given definition.\n\nThe rank of a set $x$ is defined as the least ordinal $\\alpha$ such that $x \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(x) = \\min\\{\\alpha \\mid x \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}\\} $$\nThe condition $x \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}$ is equivalent to the statement that for every element $y \\in x$, we have $y \\in V_{\\alpha}$. Thus,\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(x) = \\min\\{\\alpha \\mid \\forall y \\in x, y \\in V_{\\alpha}\\} $$\nTo make this definition more operational, we establish a key relationship between the rank of a set and its membership in the von Neumann hierarchy. A set $y$ is an element of a level $V_{\\alpha}$ if and only if the rank of $y$ is strictly less than $\\alpha$.\nLet's prove this: $y \\in V_{\\alpha} \\iff \\mathrm{rank}(y)  \\alpha$.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $y \\in V_{\\alpha}$. By the cumulative nature of the hierarchy, there exists an ordinal $\\beta  \\alpha$ such that $y \\in V_{\\beta+1}$. The definition $V_{\\beta+1} = \\mathcal{P}(V_{\\beta})$ means that $y$ is a subset of $V_{\\beta}$, i.e., $y \\subseteq V_{\\beta}$. By the definition of rank, $\\mathrm{rank}(y)$ is the *least* ordinal $\\gamma$ such that $y \\subseteq V_{\\gamma}$. Therefore, we must have $\\mathrm{rank}(y) \\le \\beta$. Since $\\beta  \\alpha$, it follows that $\\mathrm{rank}(y)  \\alpha$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $\\mathrm{rank}(y)  \\alpha$. Let $\\gamma = \\mathrm{rank}(y)$. By definition, $y \\subseteq V_{\\gamma}$, which means $y \\in \\mathcal{P}(V_{\\gamma})$. According to the construction of the hierarchy, $\\mathcal{P}(V_{\\gamma}) = V_{\\gamma+1}$. So, $y \\in V_{\\gamma+1}$. Since $\\gamma  \\alpha$, we have $\\gamma+1 \\le \\alpha$. The hierarchy is cumulative ($V_{\\beta} \\subseteq V_{\\delta}$ for $\\beta \\le \\delta$), so $V_{\\gamma+1} \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}$. Therefore, $y \\in V_{\\alpha}$.\n\nUsing this equivalence, the definition of the rank of $x$ can be reformulated:\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(x) = \\min\\{\\alpha \\mid \\forall y \\in x, \\mathrm{rank}(y)  \\alpha\\} $$\nThis states that $\\mathrm{rank}(x)$ is the least ordinal that is a strict upper bound for the set of ordinals $\\{\\mathrm{rank}(y) \\mid y \\in x\\}$. The least strict upper bound of a set of ordinals $S$ is $\\sup\\{\\beta+1 \\mid \\beta \\in S\\}$.\nTherefore, we arrive at the standard recursive formula for rank:\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(x) = \\sup\\{\\mathrm{rank}(y) + 1 \\mid y \\in x\\} $$\nThe supremum of the empty set of ordinals is defined to be the smallest ordinal, $0$.

Applying the formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) = \\sup\\{\\mathrm{rank}(y) + 1 \\mid y \\in \\emptyset\\} $$\nThis is the supremum of an empty set of ordinals, which is $0$.\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) = 0 $$\nAlternatively, using the initial definition: $\\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) = \\min\\{\\alpha \\mid \\emptyset \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}\\}$. Since $\\emptyset$ is a subset of every set, $\\emptyset \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}$ holds for all ordinals $\\alpha$, including $\\alpha=0$. The least such ordinal is $0$.\n\n**2. Computation of $\\mathrm{rank}(\\{\\emptyset\\})$**\nLet $x = \\{\\emptyset\\}$. The only element of $x$ is $\\emptyset$. Applying the formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(\\{\\emptyset\\}) = \\sup\\{\\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) + 1\\} $$\nUsing the result from the previous step, $\\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(\\{\\emptyset\\}) = \\sup\\{0 + 1\\} = \\sup\\{1\\} = 1 $$\n\n**3. Computation of $\\mathrm{rank}(\\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\})$**\nLet $x = \\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$. The only element of $x$ is $\\{\\emptyset\\}$.

The elements of $F$ are von Neumann natural numbers (finite ordinals). To compute $\\mathrm{rank}(F)$, we first need to know the rank of its elements. We will show by induction that for any natural number $n \\in \\omega$, $\\mathrm{rank}(n) = n$.\n\nThe principle of induction is a special case of transfinite induction over the well-ordered set $\\omega$.\nBase case ($n=0$): As shown in part 1, $\\mathrm{rank}(0) = \\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) = 0$. The base case holds.\nInductive step: Assume that for some $n \\in \\omega$, $\\mathrm{rank}(k) = k$ for all natural numbers $k  n$. A von Neumann ordinal is the set of its predecessors, so $n = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. We compute its rank:\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(n) = \\mathrm{rank}(\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}) = \\sup\\{\\mathrm{rank}(k) + 1 \\mid k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}\\} $$\nBy the induction hypothesis, $\\mathrm{rank}(k) = k$ for each $k \\in n$.\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(n) = \\sup\\{k + 1 \\mid k  n\\} = \\sup\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\} $$\nThe supremum of this finite set of ordinals is its maximum element, which is $n$. Thus, $\\mathrm{rank}(n) = n$.\nBy the principle of induction, $\\mathrm{rank}(n) = n$ for all $n \\in \\omega$.\n\nNow we can compute the rank of $F$, a finite subset of $\\omega$.\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(F) = \\sup\\{\\mathrm{rank}(n) + 1 \\mid n \\in F\\} $$\nSince $\\mathrm{rank}(n) = n$ for every $n \\in F$:\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(F) = \\sup\\{n + 1 \\mid n \\in F\\} $$\nThis expression serves as the required closed form. It correctly handles both cases:\n- If $F = \\emptyset$, the set $\\{n + 1 \\mid n \\in F\\}$ is empty, and its supremum is $0$. So $\\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n- If $F \\neq \\emptyset$, since $F$ is a finite set of natural numbers, it has a maximum element, $\\max(F)$. The set $\\{n + 1 \\mid n \\in F\\}$ is a non-empty finite set of ordinals, and its supremum is its maximum element, which is $\\max(F) + 1$.\n\nThe four computed ranks are:\n- $\\mathrm{rank}(\\emptyset) = 0$\n- $\\mathrm{rank}(\\{\\emptyset\\}) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{rank}(\\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}) = 2$\n- $\\mathrm{rank}(F) = \\sup\\{n + 1 \\mid n \\in F\\}$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\pmatrix{0  1  2  \\sup\\{n+1 \\mid n \\in F\\}}} $$", "id": "3058027"}, {"introduction": "Transfinite recursion is not just for defining properties of sets, but also for constructing sets that model abstract structures.

An infinite descending chain would be a sequence of elements $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots$ from $A$ such that $x_1\\,R\\,x_0$, $x_2\\,R\\,x_1$, and so on. Since the set $A$ is finite with only $4$ elements, any infinite sequence of elements from $A$ must contain repetitions.

The longest possible chain is $c \\to b \\to a$, which corresponds to the descending sequence $a, b, c$ where $b\\,R\\,a$ and $c\\,R\\,b$. Its length is $2$. As no path can be infinite, no infinite descending chain exists. Therefore, the relation $R$ is well-founded on $A$.\n\nA relation is extensional if for any two distinct elements $x,y \\in A$, their sets of predecessors under $R$ are distinct. Let $P(x) = \\{z \\in A : z\\,R\\,x\\}$. We compute this set for each element in $A$:\n- For $x=a$, the only pair in $R$ of the form $(z,a)$ is $(b,a)$.

Thus, $P(c) = \\emptyset$.\n- For $x=d$, the pairs in $R$ of the form $(z,d)$ are $(b,d)$ and $(c,d)$. Thus, $P(d) = \\{b,c\\}$.\n\nWe now compare these sets for all distinct pairs of elements in $A$:\n$P(a)=\\{b\\}$, $P(b)=\\{c\\}$, $P(c)=\\emptyset$, $P(d)=\\{b,c\\}$.\nAll four sets are distinct.

The recursive definition is given by $r(a) = \\sup\\{ r(b) + 1 : b \\prec a \\}$ for each $a \\in A$. The existence and uniqueness of such a function are a direct consequence of the Principle of Transfinite Recursion on a well-founded relation. A well-ordering $\\prec$ on a set $A$ is, by definition, a well-founded relation. The Transfinite Recursion Theorem states that for any well-founded set $(S, R)$ and any function $G$ (a \"recursion rule\"), there is a unique function $F$ with domain $S$ such that for any $x \\in S$, $F(x) = G(x, F \\upharpoonright \\{y \\in S : y R x\\})$.\n\nIn our specific case, the set is $A$ and the relation is $\\prec$. We can define the recursion rule $G$ as follows: for any $a \\in A$ and any function $f$ defined on the set of predecessors $\\{b \\in A : b \\prec a\\}$, let $G(a,f) = \\sup\\{f(b)+1 : b \\in \\mathrm{dom}(f)\\}$. The theorem then guarantees a unique function $r: A \\to V$ (where $V$ is the class of all sets) satisfying $r(a) = G(a, r \\upharpoonright \\{b \\in A : b \\prec a\\})$, which is precisely $r(a) = \\sup\\{r(b)+1 : b \\prec a\\}$. We must confirm that the values $r(a)$ are ordinals. We can prove this by transfinite induction on $a \\in A$. For any minimal element $a_0 \\in A$ with respect to $\\prec$, the set $\\{b: b \\prec a_0\\}$ is empty. Thus, $r(a_0) = \\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$, which is an ordinal. For the inductive step, let $a \\in A$ and assume that for all $b \\prec a$, $r(b)$ is an ordinal. Then $r(b)+1$ is the successor ordinal of $r(b)$ and is also an ordinal. The value $r(a)$ is the supremum of a set of ordinals, $\\{r(b)+1 : b \\prec a\\}$, which is itself an ordinal. Thus, the codomain of $r$ is indeed the class of ordinals, $\\mathrm{On}$.\n\nSecond, we prove by transfinite induction on $a \\in A$ that $b \\prec a \\implies r(b)  r(a)$. Let $a \\in A$, and assume for the sake of induction that the claim holds for all elements smaller than $a$. That is, for any $c \\prec a$, we have $d \\prec c \\implies r(d)  r(c)$. We wish to show that for any $b \\prec a$, $r(b)  r(a)$. Let $b$ be an element of $A$ such that $b \\prec a$. By the definition of $r$, $r(a) = \\sup\\{r(c)+1 : c \\prec a\\}$. Since $b$ is one of the elements $c$ in the index set of the supremum, it must be that $r(a) \\geq r(b)+1$. As $r(b)$ is an ordinal, we know $r(b)+1 > r(b)$. Therefore, $r(a) > r(b)$, which is the same as $r(b)  r(a)$. This completes the inductive proof.\n\nThis strict inequality shows that $r$ is an injective, order-preserving map from $(A, \\prec)$ to $(\\mathrm{On}, )$. Such a map is an order-embedding. The image of $r$, $\\mathrm{ran}(r) = \\{r(a) : a \\in A\\}$, is a set of ordinals, and $r$ provides an order-isomorphism between $(A, \\prec)$ and $(\\mathrm{ran}(r), )$. The order type of a well-ordered set is the unique ordinal to which it is order-isomorphic. The set $\\mathrm{ran}(r)$ is a set of ordinals well-ordered by $$, so its order type is an ordinal, say $\\gamma$. This means $\\gamma$ is the order type of $(A, \\prec)$. Since $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, $A$ is a countable set (i.e., its cardinality $|A| \\le |\\mathbb{N}|=\\aleph_0$). The function $r$ is a bijection between $A$ and $\\mathrm{ran}(r)$, so $|\\mathrm{ran}(r)| = |A| \\le \\aleph_0$. The ordinal $\\gamma$ is order-isomorphic to $\\mathrm{ran}(r)$, so they have the same cardinality, $|\\gamma| = |\\mathrm{ran}(r)| \\le \\aleph_0$. An ordinal whose cardinality is at most $\\aleph_0$ is, by definition, a countable ordinal. Hence, the order type of any well-ordering on a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ is a countable ordinal.\n\nThird, we explain the relationship between countable ordinals, $\\omega_1$, and injections into $\\mathbb{N}$. The ordinal $\\omega_1$ is defined as the least uncountable ordinal. This is equivalent to saying that $\\omega_1$ is the set of all countable ordinals.\nAn ordinal $\\alpha$ is defined to be countable if there exists an injection from $\\alpha$ into $\\mathbb{N}$. Thus, for any ordinal $\\alpha  \\omega_1$, by definition, $\\alpha$ is a countable ordinal, and so there must be an injection from $\\alpha$ into $\\mathbb{N}$.\nNext, we show there cannot be an injection from $\\omega_1$ into $\\mathbb{N}$. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that such an injection $f: \\omega_1 \\to \\mathbb{N}$ exists. Let $A = \\mathrm{ran}(f) \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$. We can define a well-ordering $\\prec$ on $A$ by \"pulling back\" the ordering of $\\omega_1$: for $x, y \\in A$, let $x \\prec y$ if and only if $f^{-1}(x)  f^{-1}(y)$. The function $f$ is an order-isomorphism between $(\\omega_1, )$ and $(A, \\prec)$. Consequently, the order type of $(A, \\prec)$ is $\\omega_1$. However, we have just shown that any well-ordering on a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ must have a countable order type. This implies that $\\omega_1$ is a countable ordinal. This is a direct contradiction to the definition of $\\omega_1$ as the least *uncountable* ordinal. Therefore, our initial assumption was false, and no injection from $\\omega_1$ into $\\mathbb{N}$ can exist.\n\nFinally, we conclude by computing $\\mathrm{Hartogs}(\\mathbb{N})$. The Hartogs number of a set $X$, $\\mathrm{Hartogs}(X)$, is the least ordinal $\\alpha$ for which there is no injection from $\\alpha$ into $X$.\nFrom the previous step, we have established two key facts for $X = \\mathbb{N}$:\n$1$. For every ordinal $\\alpha  \\omega_1$, there exists an injection from $\\alpha$ into $\\mathbb{N}$.\n$2$. There does not exist an injection from $\\omega_1$ into $\\mathbb{N}$.\nStatement $(2)$ implies that the set of ordinals $\\alpha$ with no injection into $\\mathbb{N}$ is non-empty, as $\\omega_1$ is a member of this set. $\\mathrm{Hartogs}(\\mathbb{N})$ is the minimum element of this set. Statement $(1)$ implies that no ordinal less than $\\omega_1$ can be in this set.\nTherefore, $\\omega_1$ must be the least such ordinal.\nThis leads to the conclusion that $\\mathrm{Hartogs}(\\mathbb{N}) = \\omega_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\omega_1}$$", "id": "3058051"}]}
