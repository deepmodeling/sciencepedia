Proceeding to the solution.\n\n***\n\nThe problem is structured in three parts. We will address them sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the first five von Neumann ordinals**\n\nWe start with the definition of the first ordinal, $\\,0\\,$, as the empty set and iteratively apply the successor operation $\\,S(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}\\,$ to construct the subsequent ordinals. The notation for a finite ordinal $\\,n\\,$ corresponds to the set of all preceding ordinals: $\\,n = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}\\,$.\n\nThe first five ordinals are denoted $\\,0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\,$. Their construction is as follows:\n\n- The first ordinal is $\\,0\\,$, defined as the empty set.\n$$0 = \\emptyset = \\{\\}$$\n\n- The second ordinal is $\\,1\\,$, the successor of $\\,0\\,$.\n$$1 = S(0) = 0 \\cup \\{0\\} = \\emptyset \\cup \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$$\n\n- The third ordinal is $\\,2\\,$, the successor of $\\,1\\,$. Using the previously constructed ordinals $\\,0\\,$ and $\\,1\\,$, we have:\n$$2 = S(1) = 1 \\cup \\{1\\} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$$\n\n- The fourth ordinal is $\\,3\\,$, the successor of $\\,2\\,$.\n$$3 = S(2) = 2 \\cup \\{2\\} = \\{0, 1\\} \\cup \\{2\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$\n\n- The fifth ordinal is $\\,4\\,$, the successor of $\\,3\\,$.\n$$4 = S(3) = 3 \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$$\n\nThese are the first five von Neumann ordinals, constructed as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Verification of the successor operation**\n\nWe must verify that for each constructed ordinal $\\,\\alpha\\,$ in the list $\\,(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\\,$, the operation $\\,S(\\alpha)\\,$ produces the next ordinal in the list. This verification applies for $\\,\\alpha \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\,$.\n\n- For $\\,\\alpha = 0\\,$:\n$$S(0) = 0 \\cup \\{0\\} = \\emptyset \\cup \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$$\nThis is precisely our constructed ordinal $\\,1\\,$. The verification holds.\n\n- For $\\,\\alpha = 1\\,$:\n$$S(1) = 1 \\cup \\{1\\}$$\nSubstituting our constructions for $\\,1 = \\{0\\}\\,$:\n$$S(1) = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{\\{0\\}\\}$$\nHowever, using the property that $\\,1 = \\{0\\}\\,$ and $\\,2 = \\{0, 1\\}\\,$, we can write:\n$$S(1) = 1 \\cup \\{1\\} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$$\nThis is precisely our constructed ordinal $\\,2\\,$. The verification holds.\n\n- For $\\,\\alpha = 2\\,$:\n$$S(2) = 2 \\cup \\{2\\} = \\{0, 1\\} \\cup \\{2\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$\nThis is precisely our constructed ordinal $\\,3\\,$. The verification holds.\n\n- For $\\,\\alpha = 3\\,$:\n$$S(3) = 3 \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$$\nThis is precisely our constructed ordinal $\\,4\\,$. The verification holds.\n\nThe successor operation correctly generates each subsequent ordinal in the constructed list.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the cardinality**\n\nWe are asked to compute the cardinality $\\,\\left|\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in 5} S(\\alpha)\\right|\\,$.\nAs discussed in the validation, the symbol $\\,5\\,$ represents the von Neumann ordinal $\\,5\\,$. Based on the construction principle, this is the set of all preceding ordinals:\n$$5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\nThe expression to evaluate is the union of sets $\\,S(\\alpha)\\,$ where $\\,\\alpha\\,$ takes on each value in the set $\\,5\\,$.\n$$\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in 5} S(\\alpha) = \\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}} S(\\alpha) = S(0) \\cup S(1) \\cup S(2) \\cup S(3) \\cup S(4)$$\nUsing the successor identity $\\,S(n) = n+1\\,$ (where $\\,n+1\\,$ is the ordinal successor set), we have:\n$$S(0) = 1$$\n$$S(1) = 2$$\n$$S(2) = 3$$\n$$S(3) = 4$$\n$$S(4) = 5$$\nThe union is therefore:\n$$1 \\cup 2 \\cup 3 \\cup 4 \\cup 5$$\nA key property of von Neumann ordinals is that for any two ordinals $\\,\\beta\\,$ and $\\,\\gamma\\,$, the relation $\\,\\beta  \\gamma\\,$ is equivalent to $\\,\\beta \\in \\gamma\\,$, which also implies $\\,\\beta \\subset \\gamma\\,$. This gives us a nested chain of sets:\n$$1 \\subset 2 \\subset 3 \\subset 4 \\subset 5$$\nThe union of a finite, nested sequence of sets is the largest set in the sequence. Therefore:\n$$\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in 5} S(\\alpha) = 5$$\nThe problem asks for the cardinality of this resulting set. We need to compute $\\,|5|\\,$.\nThe set $\\,5\\,$ is explicitly:\n$$5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\nThis set contains five distinct elements: the ordinals $\\,0, 1, 2, 3,\\,$ and $\\,4\\,$. The cardinality of a finite set is the number of its elements.\n$$\\left|5\\right| = \\left|\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\right| = 5$$\nThus, the final result is $\\,5\\,$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3048265"}, {"introduction": "One of the most striking features of transfinite arithmetic is that it is not commutative; for example, $2 \\cdot \\omega$ is not the same as $\\omega \\cdot 2$.

The order type of $(\\mathbb{N},)$ is the ordinal $\\omega$, and the order type of $(\\{0,1\\},)$ is the ordinal $2$.\n\n**1. Proof that $(X,\\prec_{A})$ and $(X,\\prec_{B})$ are well-orders.**\n\nA total order is a well-order if and only if every non-empty subset has a least element.\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{A})$: Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of $X$. Let $\\pi_1: X \\to \\mathbb{N}$ be the projection onto the first coordinate, so $\\pi_1(n,i) = n$. Consider the set $S_N = \\pi_1(S) = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\exists i \\in \\{0,1\\}, (n,i) \\in S \\}$. Since $S$ is non-empty, $S_N$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$. Because $(\\mathbb{N},)$ is a well-order, $S_N$ has a least element, which we denote by $n_0$. Now, consider the set $S_I = \\{ i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\mid (n_0, i) \\in S \\}$. This set is a non-empty subset of $\\{0,1\\}$. As $\\{0,1\\}$ with the order $01$ is well-ordered, $S_I$ has a least element, which we denote by $i_0$. The element $(n_0, i_0)$ belongs to $S$. We claim it is the least element of $S$ under $\\prec_A$. Let $(m,j)$ be an arbitrary element of $S$. By the definition of $n_0$, we have $n_0 \\leq m$.\n- If $n_0  m$, then by the definition of $\\prec_A$, $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_A (m,j)$.\n- If $n_0 = m$, then $(m,j)$ is of the form $(n_0, j)$. Since $(n_0, j) \\in S$, it follows that $j \\in S_I$. By the definition of $i_0$, we have $i_0 \\leq j$. If $i_0  j$, then $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_A (n_0, j)$. If $i_0 = j$, then $(n_0, i_0) = (n_0, j) = (m,j)$.\nThus, for any $(m,j) \\in S$, we have $(n_0, i_0) \\preceq_A (m,j)$. Therefore, $(n_0, i_0)$ is the least element of $S$. This proves that $(X, \\prec_A)$ is a well-order.\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{B})$: Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of $X$. Let $\\pi_2: X \\to \\{0,1\\}$ be the projection onto the second coordinate. The set $S_I = \\pi_2(S) = \\{ i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\mid \\exists n \\in \\mathbb{N}, (n,i) \\in S \\}$ is a non-empty subset of $\\{0,1\\}$. Since $\\{0,1\\}$ is well-ordered, $S_I$ has a least element, $i_0$. Now, consider the set $S_N = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid (n, i_0) \\in S \\}$. This set is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ (because $i_0$ was chosen from $S_I$). Since $\\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered, $S_N$ has a least element, $n_0$. The element $(n_0, i_0)$ is in $S$. We claim it is the least element of $S$ under $\\prec_B$. Let $(m,j)$ be an arbitrary element of $S$. By the definition of $i_0$, we have $i_0 \\leq j$.\n- If $i_0  j$, then by the definition of $\\prec_B$, $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_B (m,j)$.\n- If $i_0 = j$, then $(m,j)$ is of the form $(m, i_0)$. Since $(m, i_0) \\in S$, it follows that $m \\in S_N$. By the definition of $n_0$, we have $n_0 \\leq m$. If $n_0  m$, then $(n_0, i_0) \\prec_B (m, i_0)$. If $n_0 = m$, then $(n_0, i_0) = (m,i_0) = (m,j)$.\nThus, for any $(m,j) \\in S$, we have $(n_0, i_0) \\preceq_B (m,j)$. Therefore, $(n_0, i_0)$ is the least element of $S$. This proves that $(X, \\prec_B)$ is a well-order.\n\n**2. Determination of Order Types and Cantor Normal Forms.**\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{A})$: The order relation $(n,i)\\prec_{A}(m,j)$ prioritizes the first coordinate $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The structure of the well-order can be visualized as blocks indexed by $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. For each $n$, the block is $\\{(n,0), (n,1)\\}$, which has order type $2$. The total order is an $\\omega$-sequence of these blocks of type $2$:\n$$\n\\underbrace{(0,0), (0,1)}_{\\text{block } n=0} \\prec_{A} \\underbrace{(1,0), (1,1)}_{\\text{block } n=1} \\prec_{A} \\underbrace{(2,0), (2,1)}_{\\text{block } n=2} \\prec_{A} \\cdots\n$$\nThis corresponds to the ordinal sum $2+2+2+\\cdots$ ($\\omega$ times). By definition, an $\\omega$-sum of the ordinal $\\alpha$ is the ordinal product $\\alpha \\cdot \\omega$. Here, $\\alpha=2$. So the order type is $2 \\cdot \\omega$.\nTo demonstrate this formally, we relate it to the problem's definition of the product $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ as the anti-lexicographical order on $\\alpha \\times \\beta$. Let $\\alpha=2=\\{0,1\\}$ and $\\beta=\\omega=\\mathbb{N}$. The set is $2 \\times \\omega = \\{0,1\\} \\times \\mathbb{N}$, and the anti-lexicographical order $\\prec'$ is given by $(i,n) \\prec' (j,m)$ iff $nm$ or ($n=m$ and $ij$). The map $f: (\\{0,1\\} \\times \\mathbb{N}, \\prec') \\to (X, \\prec_A)$ defined by $f(i,n) = (n,i)$ is an order-isomorphism, since $(i,n) \\prec' (j,m)$ is equivalent to $(n,i) \\prec_A (m,j)$. Therefore, $\\text{type}(X, \\prec_A) = \\text{type}(\\{0,1\\} \\times \\mathbb{N}, \\text{anti-lex}) = \\text{type}(\\{0,1\\}) \\cdot \\text{type}(\\mathbb{N}) = 2 \\cdot \\omega$.\nThe ordinal $2 \\cdot \\omega$ is the supremum of the finite products $2 \\cdot n$ for $n  \\omega$: $2 \\cdot \\omega = \\sup_{n\\omega} (2 \\cdot n)$. Since $2 \\cdot n = n \\cdot 2$ for finite $n$, this is $\\sup_{n\\omega} (2n) = \\omega$.\nAlternatively, the map $g: (\\mathbb{N}, ) \\to (X, \\prec_A)$ defined by $g(k) = (\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor, k \\pmod 2)$ is an order-isomorphism. This directly shows that $\\text{type}(X, \\prec_A) = \\omega$.\nThe Cantor Normal Form of $\\omega$ is $\\omega^1 \\cdot 1$.\n\nFor $(X, \\prec_{B})$: The order relation $(n,i)\\prec_{B}(m,j)$ prioritizes the second coordinate $i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This divides $X$ into two major blocks corresponding to $i=0$ and $i=1$.\nThe first block consists of all elements $(n,0)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, ordered by $n$. This is the set $\\{(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), \\ldots \\}$, which is order-isomorphic to $\\mathbb{N}$ and has order type $\\omega$.\nThe second block consists of all elements $(n,1)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, ordered by $n$. This is the set $\\{(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), \\ldots \\}$, which is also order-isomorphic to $\\mathbb{N}$ and has order type $\\omega$.\nEvery element in the first block comes before every element in the second block. The overall structure is a copy of $\\omega$ followed by another copy of $\\omega$. This is precisely the definition of the ordinal sum $\\omega+\\omega$.\nThis structure corresponds directly to the problem's definition of ordinal multiplication. The set is $X = \\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$, and $\\prec_B$ is the anti-lexicographical ordering. Therefore, the order type is $\\text{type}(\\mathbb{N}) \\cdot \\text{type}(\\{0,1\\}) = \\omega \\cdot 2$. By definition, $\\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega+\\omega$.\nThe Cantor Normal Form of $\\omega \\cdot 2$ can be written as $\\omega^1 \\cdot 2$.\n\n**3. Explanation of Non-Commutativity of Ordinal Multiplication.**\n\nOur analysis has shown that the order type of $(X, \\prec_A)$ corresponds to the product $2 \\cdot \\omega = \\omega$, while the order type of $(X, \\prec_B)$ corresponds to the product $\\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega + \\omega$. The ordinals $\\omega$ and $\\omega+\\omega$ are not equal, demonstrating the non-commutativity of ordinal multiplication. This inequality can be explained by examining the structural differences in the placement of limit points.\n\nAn element $y$ in a well-ordered set is a limit element if it is not the minimum element and has no immediate predecessor.\n- In $(X, \\prec_A)$, which has order type $\\omega$: We listed the elements as $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), \\ldots$. The first element $(0,0)$ is the minimum. Every other element has an immediate predecessor: the predecessor of $(n,1)$ is $(n,0)$, and the predecessor of $(n,0)$ for $n0$ is $(n-1,1)$. Thus, there are no limit elements within the set $(X, \\prec_A)$. The order type $\\omega$ is a limit ordinal, but no element in the set represents a limit stage.\n\n- In $(X, \\prec_B)$, which has order type $\\omega \\cdot 2$: We listed the elements as an $\\omega$-sequence $\\{(n,0)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ followed by another $\\omega$-sequence $\\{(n,1)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$. Consider the element $(0,1)$, which is the first element of the second sequence. The set of its predecessors is the entire first sequence, $P = \\{(n,0) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This set $P$ has no maximal element, since for any $(n,0) \\in P$, the element $(n+1,0)$ is also in $P$ and is greater. Therefore, $(0,1)$ has no immediate predecessor and is not the minimum element of $(X, \\prec_B)$. It is a limit element.\n\nThe phrasing \"least elements of tails\" can be understood in this context. The set $\\{(n,1) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ can be seen as the \"tail\" of the ordering that remains after the initial segment $\\{(n,0) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is removed. The least element of this tail is $(0,1)$, which is a limit element. In contrast, in $(X, \\prec_A)$, no proper initial segment is such that the least element of its complement is a limit element.\n\nThe existence of a limit element in $(X, \\prec_B)$ and the absence of any in $(X, \\prec_A)$ is a fundamental structural difference. An order-isomorphism preserves the property of being a limit element. Since $(X, \\prec_A)$ and $(X, \\prec_B)$ differ in their sets of limit elements, they cannot be order-isomorphic. Consequently, their order types, $2 \\cdot \\omega = \\omega$ and $\\omega \\cdot 2$, must be different.

Every nonzero ordinal $\\alpha$ has a unique Cantor normal form (CNF), that is, can be written as \n$$\\alpha = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\omega^{\\gamma_1} c_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_k} c_k,$$\nwhere $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\gamma_0  \\gamma_1  \\cdots  \\gamma_k$ are ordinals, and $c_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ are positive finite coefficients interpreted as right-multiplication by $c_i$.\n\nStarting from the above definitions, derive clear, rigorous rules for computing sums and products of ordinals by manipulating their Cantor normal forms, including:\n- how to add two ordinals in Cantor normal form by comparing leading exponents and combining equal leading exponents, and\n- how to multiply an ordinal in Cantor normal form by a finite natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (interpreting $\\alpha \\cdot n$ as the $n$-fold ordinal sum of $\\alpha$), and by $\\omega$ (interpreting $\\alpha \\cdot \\omega$ as the supremum of $\\alpha \\cdot n$ for $n  \\omega$), together with the use of right-distributivity $\\alpha \\cdot (\\beta + \\gamma) = \\alpha \\cdot \\beta + \\alpha \\cdot \\gamma$.\n\nThen, apply your derived rules to compute the product \n$$ (\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot (\\omega + 3) $$\nand express the result as a single ordinal in Cantor normal form. Your final answer must be a single closed-form ordinal expression. No rounding is required and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is well-defined, scientifically grounded in the mathematical theory of ordinals, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It requires the derivation of standard arithmetic rules for ordinals in Cantor Normal Form (CNF) and the application of these rules to a specific calculation.\n\nFirst, we derive the necessary rules for ordinal arithmetic based on the provided definitions. Let two non-zero ordinals $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be given by their Cantor normal forms:\n$$ \\alpha = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\omega^{\\gamma_1} c_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_k} c_k $$\n$$ \\beta = \\omega^{\\delta_0} d_0 + \\omega^{\\delta_1} d_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\delta_m} d_m $$\nwhere $\\gamma_0  \\gamma_1  \\dots  \\gamma_k \\ge 0$ and $\\delta_0  \\delta_1  \\dots  \\delta_m \\ge 0$ are ordinals, and $c_i, d_j$ are positive integers.\n\n**1. Rules for Ordinal Addition ($\\alpha + \\beta$)**\n\nThe sum $\\alpha + \\beta$ is determined by comparing the leading exponents $\\gamma_0$ and $\\delta_0$.\n\nCase 1: $\\gamma_0  \\delta_0$.\nIn this case, $\\alpha  \\omega^{\\gamma_0+1} \\le \\omega^{\\delta_0}$. The fundamental property of ordinal addition is that if $\\xi  \\omega^\\nu$ for some ordinal $\\nu  0$, then $\\xi + \\omega^\\nu = \\omega^\\nu$. More generally, if $\\xi  \\eta$ and $\\eta$ is a limit ordinal which is a power of $\\omega$, adding $\\xi$ from the left is absorbed.\nLet $\\beta = \\omega^{\\delta_0}d_0 + \\beta'$, where $\\beta'$ represents the rest of the terms. Then $\\alpha+\\beta = \\alpha + (\\omega^{\\delta_0}d_0 + \\beta') = (\\alpha + \\omega^{\\delta_0}d_0) + \\beta'$.\nSince $\\alpha  \\omega^{\\delta_0}$ and $\\delta_0  0$, we have $\\alpha + \\omega^{\\delta_0} = \\omega^{\\delta_0}$.\nThen $\\alpha + \\omega^{\\delta_0}d_0 = \\alpha + (\\omega^{\\delta_0} + \\omega^{\\delta_0} + \\dots) = (\\alpha+\\omega^{\\delta_0}) + (\\omega^{\\delta_0} + \\dots) = \\omega^{\\delta_0} + (\\omega^{\\delta_0} + \\dots) = \\omega^{\\delta_0}d_0$.\nThus, $(\\alpha + \\omega^{\\delta_0}d_0) + \\beta' = \\omega^{\\delta_0}d_0 + \\beta' = \\beta$.\nRule: If $\\gamma_0  \\delta_0$, then $\\alpha + \\beta = \\beta$.\n\nCase 2: $\\gamma_0  \\delta_0$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\alpha'$, where $\\alpha'$ is the tail of $\\alpha$'s CNF. The leading exponent of $\\alpha'$ is $\\gamma_1  \\gamma_0$.\n$\\alpha + \\beta = (\\omega^{\\gamma_0}c_0 + \\alpha') + \\beta = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}c_0 + (\\alpha' + \\beta)$.\nWe now evaluate $\\alpha'+\\beta$. The leading exponent of $\\alpha'$ is $\\gamma_1$ and that of $\\beta$ is $\\delta_0$. Since $\\gamma_0  \\delta_0$, we must compare $\\gamma_1$ and $\\delta_0$. This suggests a recursive formulation.\nA more direct rule is as follows: we truncate $\\alpha$ at the first exponent $\\gamma_i$ that is not greater than $\\delta_0$.\nLet $j$ be the index such that $\\gamma_j  \\delta_0$ and either $j=k$ (the last term) or $\\gamma_{j+1}  \\delta_0$. (If $\\gamma_0$ itself is not greater than $\\delta_0$, this case does not apply).\nLet $\\alpha_{\\text{head}} = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_j} c_j$ and $\\alpha_{\\text{tail}} = \\omega^{\\gamma_{j+1}} c_{j+1} + \\cdots$. Then $\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\text{head}} + \\alpha_{\\text{tail}}$.\n$\\alpha + \\beta = (\\alpha_{\\text{head}} + \\alpha_{\\text{tail}}) + \\beta = \\alpha_{\\text{head}} + (\\alpha_{\\text{tail}} + \\beta)$.\nThe leading exponent of $\\alpha_{\\text{tail}}$ is $\\gamma_{j+1}  \\delta_0$. By Case 1, $\\alpha_{\\text{tail}} + \\beta = \\beta$.\nRule: If $\\gamma_0  \\delta_0$, then $\\alpha + \\beta = \\alpha_{\\text{head}} + \\beta = (\\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_j} c_j) + \\beta$.\nAs $\\gamma_j  \\delta_0$, this results in simple concatenation of the CNF terms: $\\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_j} c_j + \\omega^{\\delta_0} d_0 + \\cdots$.\n\nCase 3: $\\gamma_0 = \\delta_0$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\alpha'$ and $\\beta = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} d_0 + \\beta'$.\n$\\alpha + \\beta = (\\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\alpha') + (\\omega^{\\gamma_0} d_0 + \\beta')$.\nAssuming $\\gamma_0  0$, $\\omega^{\\gamma_0}$ is a limit ordinal. The leading exponent of $\\alpha'$ is $\\gamma_1  \\gamma_0$. Thus, $\\alpha'  \\omega^{\\gamma_0}$.\nAs in Case 1, $\\alpha' + (\\omega^{\\gamma_0} d_0 + \\beta') = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} d_0 + \\beta' = \\beta$.\nSo $\\alpha+\\beta = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}c_0 + \\beta = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}c_0 + \\omega^{\\gamma_0}d_0 + \\beta' = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0+d_0) + \\beta'$.\n(Note that $c_0, d_0$ are finite, so ordinal sum $c_0+d_0$ is the standard integer sum).\nIf $\\gamma_0=0$, $\\alpha=c_0, \\beta=d_0$, so $\\alpha+\\beta=c_0+d_0$. The rule gives $\\omega^0(c_0+d_0) = c_0+d_0$, so it holds.\nRule: If $\\gamma_0=\\delta_0$, then $\\alpha+\\beta = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0+d_0) + \\beta'$.\n\n**2. Rules for Ordinal Multiplication**\n\nWe use right-distributivity: $\\alpha \\cdot (\\beta + \\gamma) = \\alpha \\cdot \\beta + \\alpha \\cdot \\gamma$.\n\nRule for Multiplication by a finite natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n  0$:\nLet $\\alpha = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\alpha'$, where $\\alpha' = \\omega^{\\gamma_1} c_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_k} c_k$. Assume $\\gamma_0  0$.\n$\\alpha \\cdot n$ is the sum of $n$ copies of $\\alpha$.\n$\\alpha \\cdot 2 = \\alpha + \\alpha = (\\omega^{\\gamma_0}c_0 + \\alpha') + (\\omega^{\\gamma_0}c_0 + \\alpha')$. The leading exponents are equal ($\\gamma_0$).\nBy Case 3 for addition, $\\alpha \\cdot 2 = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0+c_0) + \\alpha' = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 \\cdot 2) + \\alpha'$.\nNow, $\\alpha \\cdot 3 = (\\alpha \\cdot 2) + \\alpha = (\\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 \\cdot 2) + \\alpha') + (\\omega^{\\gamma_0}c_0 + \\alpha')$.\nAgain by Case 3, this is $\\omega^{\\gamma_0}((c_0 \\cdot 2)+c_0) + \\alpha' = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 \\cdot 3) + \\alpha'$.\nBy induction, for a finite $n$, $\\alpha \\cdot n = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\alpha'$.\nThis means that if $\\gamma_0  0$, only the coefficient of the leading term is multiplied by $n$.\nIf $\\gamma_0 = 0$, $\\alpha=c_0$ is a finite ordinal. Then $\\alpha \\cdot n = c_0 n$, which is $\\omega^0(c_0 n)$.\nSo the rule holds for any $\\alpha0$: $\\alpha \\cdot n = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\omega^{\\gamma_1}c_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_k} c_k$.\n\nRule for Multiplication by $\\omega$:\nBy definition, $\\alpha \\cdot \\omega = \\sup\\{\\alpha \\cdot n : n  \\omega\\}$. Let $\\alpha = \\omega^{\\gamma_0} c_0 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_k} c_k$ with $\\alpha0$.\nUsing the rule above, $\\alpha \\cdot n = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\omega^{\\gamma_1}c_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_k} c_k$.\nLet $\\delta = \\omega^{\\gamma_1}c_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\gamma_k} c_k$ (if $k=0, \\delta=0$).\n$\\alpha \\cdot \\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} \\{ \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\delta \\}$.\nThe sequence $\\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n)$ for $n=1,2,3,\\dots$ has supremum $\\omega^{\\gamma_0} \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^{\\gamma_0+1}$.\nSince $\\delta  \\omega^{\\gamma_0}$ (if $\\alpha'$ is non-empty), adding $\\delta$ does not change the supremum of this sequence.\nFor any $n$, $\\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) \\le \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\delta  \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\omega^{\\gamma_0} = \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n + 1)$.\nThe set $\\{\\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\delta | n\\omega\\}$ is cofinal with $\\{\\omega^{\\gamma_0}m | m\\omega\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\sup_{n  \\omega} \\{ \\omega^{\\gamma_0}(c_0 n) + \\delta \\} = \\omega^{\\gamma_0+1}$.\nRule: For any $\\alpha  0$, $\\alpha \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^{\\gamma_0+1}$, where $\\gamma_0$ is the leading exponent of $\\alpha$.\n\n**Application to compute $(\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot (\\omega + 3)$**\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\omega^2 + \\omega$ and $\\beta = \\omega + 3$. We want to compute $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$.\nUsing right-distributivity:\n$$ (\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot (\\omega + 3) = (\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot \\omega + (\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot 3 $$\n\nStep 1: Compute $(\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot \\omega$.\nThe ordinal operand is $\\omega^2 + \\omega$. Its CNF is $\\omega^2 \\cdot 1 + \\omega^1 \\cdot 1$.\nThe leading exponent is $\\gamma_0 = 2$.\nUsing the rule for multiplication by $\\omega$, we get:\n$$ (\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^{2+1} = \\omega^3 $$\n\nStep 2: Compute $(\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot 3$.\nThe ordinal operand is $\\omega^2 + \\omega = \\omega^2 \\cdot 1 + \\omega^1 \\cdot 1$.\nThe leading exponent is $\\gamma_0=2$ with coefficient $c_0=1$. The rest of the CNF is $\\omega^1 \\cdot 1$.\nUsing the rule for multiplication by a finite number $n=3$:\n$$ (\\omega^2 + \\omega) \\cdot 3 = \\omega^2 (1 \\cdot 3) + \\omega^1 \\cdot 1 = \\omega^2 \\cdot 3 + \\omega $$\n\nStep 3: Compute the final sum.\nWe need to add the results from Step 1 and Step 2:\n$$ \\omega^3 + (\\omega^2 \\cdot 3 + \\omega) $$\nLet the first term be $A = \\omega^3$ and the second term be $B = \\omega^2 \\cdot 3 + \\omega$.\nThe leading exponent of $A$ is $3$. The leading exponent of $B$ is $2$.\nSince $3 > 2$, we apply the addition rule for $\\gamma_0 > \\delta_0$.\nThe ordinal $A$ has no terms with exponents less than or equal to $2$. We truncate $A$ after all terms with exponents greater than $2$. This means we take all of $A$. The result is the concatenation of the CNF of $A$ and the CNF of $B$.\n$$ \\omega^3 + (\\omega^2 \\cdot 3 + \\omega) = \\omega^3 + \\omega^2 \\cdot 3 + \\omega $$\nThe resulting expression has exponents $(3, 2, 1)$, which are strictly decreasing. Therefore, it is in Cantor Normal Form.\nThe final result is $\\omega^3 + \\omega^2 \\cdot 3 + \\omega$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\omega^{3} + \\omega^{2} \\cdot 3 + \\omega} $$", "id": "3048274"}]}
