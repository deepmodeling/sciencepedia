Since $3$ has three elements $0$, $1$, and $2$, its subsets are all combinations of these elements. Writing them out explicitly, we have the following eight subsets:\n- The empty subset: $\\emptyset$.\n- Singletons: $\\{0\\} = \\{\\emptyset\\}$, $\\{1\\} = \\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$, $\\{2\\} = \\{\\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\}$.\n- Doubletons: $\\{0,1\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$, $\\{0,2\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\}$, $\\{1,2\\} = \\{\\{\\emptyset\\}, \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\}$.\n- The whole set: $\\{0,1,2\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}, \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\}$.\n\nCounting these subsets shows that there are $8$ of them, so\n$$\n|\\mathcal{P}(3)| = 8.\n$$\n\nFinally, we confirm that $8 \\in \\omega$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and grounded in the standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers. The definitions and axioms are standard and sufficient for a rigorous solution. We proceed with the computation and analysis.\n\nFirst, we must explicitly construct the set representing the natural number $4$ based on the provided definitions. The von Neumann ordinals are defined recursively. The number $0$ is the empty set, and each subsequent number is the set of all its predecessors.\nThe base case is $0 = \\varnothing$.\nThe successor of a set $x$ is $S(x) = x \\cup \\{x\\}$.\nUsing this, we construct the first few natural numbers:\n$1 = S(0) = 0 \\cup \\{0\\} = \\varnothing \\cup \\{\\varnothing\\} = \\{\\varnothing\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n$2 = S(1) = 1 \\cup \\{1\\} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{\\{0\\}\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n$3 = S(2) = 2 \\cup \\{2\\} = \\{0, 1\\} \\cup \\{\\{0, 1\\}\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n$4 = S(3) = 3 \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\} \\cup \\{\\{0, 1, 2\\}\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\nSo, the set representing the number $4$ is $4 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nWith the explicit form of the set $4$, we can now compute $\\bigcup 4$ and $\\bigcap 4$.\n\n**Computation of $\\bigcup 4$ and its relation to the predecessor of $4$**\n\nThe problem defines the union of a set $a$ as $\\bigcup a = \\{x : \\exists y \\in a \\, (x \\in y)\\}$.\nApplying this definition to the set $a = 4 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, we get:\n$\\bigcup 4 = \\{x : \\exists y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\, (x \\in y)\\}$.\nThis means that an element $x$ is in $\\bigcup 4$ if and only if it is an element of at least one of the sets $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$. This is equivalent to taking the union of the elements of $4$:\n$\\bigcup 4 = 0 \\cup 1 \\cup 2 \\cup 3$.\nSubstituting the set-theoretic representations:\n$\\bigcup 4 = \\varnothing \\cup \\{0\\} \\cup \\{0, 1\\} \\cup \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe union of these sets is the set of all elements that appear in any of them:\n$\\bigcup 4 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nBy the von Neumann construction, the set $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ is the representation of the natural number $3$. Therefore, $\\bigcup 4 = 3$.\n\nThe predecessor of a non-zero natural number $n$ under the successor function $S$ is the number $m$ such that $S(m) = n$. The problem states that $4 = S(3)$. Thus, the predecessor of $4$ is $3$.\nOur calculation shows that $\\bigcup 4 = 3$. We conclude that $\\bigcup 4$ is precisely the predecessor of $4$. This is a general property for any successor ordinal $\\alpha+1$: since $\\alpha+1 = \\alpha \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}$, it follows that $\\bigcup(\\alpha+1) = \\bigcup(\\alpha \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}) = (\\bigcup\\alpha) \\cup (\\bigcup\\{\\alpha\\}) = (\\bigcup\\alpha) \\cup \\alpha$. Because ordinals are transitive sets, every element of an element of $\\alpha$ is also an element of $\\alpha$, so $\\bigcup\\alpha \\subseteq \\alpha$. This implies $(\\bigcup\\alpha) \\cup \\alpha = \\alpha$. Thus, $\\bigcup(\\alpha+1) = \\alpha$.\n\n**Computation of $\\bigcap 4$ and its relation to the minimum of $4$**\n\nThe set $4=\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ is non-empty, so the definition of intersection applies: $\\bigcap a = \\{x : \\forall y \\in a \\, (x \\in y)\\}$.\nFor $a = 4 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, this becomes:\n$\\bigcap 4 = \\{x : \\forall y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\, (x \\in y)\\}$.\nAn element $x$ belongs to $\\bigcap 4$ if and only if $x$ is an element of every member of the set $4$. That is, $x$ must satisfy all four conditions simultaneously: $x \\in 0$, $x \\in 1$, $x \\in 2$, and $x \\in 3$.\nThe first condition is $x \\in 0$. Since $0 = \\varnothing$, there is no element $x$ that can satisfy $x \\in \\varnothing$.\nBecause the overall condition is a conjunction of four statements, and the first statement ($x \\in 0$) is false for every possible $x$, the entire condition is false for every $x$.\nConsequently, there are no elements in the set $\\bigcap 4$. The set with no elements is the empty set, $\\varnothing$.\nTherefore, $\\bigcap 4 = \\varnothing$.\nBy the von Neumann construction, $\\varnothing$ is the representation of the natural number $0$. Thus, $\\bigcap 4 = 0$.\n\nThe problem asks to relate this result to the minimum of the initial segment $4=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ under the membership relation $\\in$. The standard ordering for von Neumann ordinals is defined by membership: for ordinals $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, $\\alpha  \\beta$ if and only if $\\alpha \\in \\beta$.\nA minimum element of a set of ordinals is an element that is smaller than all other elements in the set. For the set $4 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, an element $m \\in 4$ is the minimum if $m \\in k$ for all other $k \\in 4$ where $k \\neq m$. The Axiom of Foundation guarantees that such a minimum element exists for any non-empty set of ordinals.\nLet's test the element $0 \\in 4$:\n- $0 \\in 1$? Yes, because $1=\\{0\\}$.\n- $0 \\in 2$? Yes, because $2=\\{0,1\\}$.\n- $0 \\in 3$? Yes, because $3=\\{0,1,2\\}$.\nSince $0$ is an element of all other members of the set $4$, it is the minimum element of $4$ under the ordering defined by $\\in$.\nOur calculation shows that $\\bigcap 4 = 0$. We conclude that $\\bigcap 4$ is precisely the minimum element of the set $4$. This is also a general property: for any non-empty set of ordinals $A$, its intersection $\\bigcap A$ is equal to its minimum element.\n\nFinally, we express the results as a single row matrix. The first entry is $\\bigcup 4=3$ and the second entry is $\\bigcap 4=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3057671"}, {"introduction": "A robust construction of numbers must provide a foundation for arithmetic.
