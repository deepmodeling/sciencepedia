The Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder (CBS) theorem states that if $|A| \\le |B|$ and $|B| \\le |A|$, then $|A| = |B|$. In the language of ordered relations, this means that `$\\le$` is antisymmetric (when we identify sets with the same cardinality). The relation `$\\le$` is also reflexive ($|A| \\le |A|$ via the identity map) and transitive (if $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to C$ are injections, then $g \\circ f: A \\to C$ is an injection, so $|A| \\le |B|$ and $|B| \\le |C|$ implies $|A| \\le |C|$).\n\nFor cardinalities to be \"comparable\" in the usual sense of a linear or total order, the relation `$\\le$` must be total, meaning for any two sets $A$ and $B$, we must have either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$. This property is known as the Law of Trichotomy for cardinals. This law is not a theorem of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ($\\text{ZF}$). Its truth is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice ($\\text{AC}$). Therefore, within $\\text{ZF}$ alone, one cannot be certain that any two cardinals are comparable. The CBS theorem only provides a conclusion ($|A| = |B|$) when the premise (injections in both directions) is met; it does not guarantee that the premise for comparability (an injection in at least one direction) is ever met for arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In $\\text{ZF}$, for all sets $A$ and $B$, either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$. Therefore, CBS suffices to compare arbitrary cardinals.**\nThis statement's premise is factually incorrect. The assertion \"for all sets $A$ and $B$, either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$\" is the Law of Trichotomy for cardinal numbers. This principle is not provable in $\\text{ZF}$ set theory. In fact, it is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice ($\\text{AC}$). As the premise is false, the conclusion derived from it is unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Assuming $\\text{AC}$, every set can be well-ordered, hence any two cardinals are comparable. Equivalently, for any sets $A$ and $B$, either there is an injection $A \\to B$ or an injection $B \\to A$, so combined with CBS, cardinalities are linearly ordered.**\nThis statement is entirely correct. The Axiom of Choice ($\\text{AC}$) is equivalent to the Well-Ordering Theorem, which asserts that any set can be endowed with a well-ordering. For any two well-ordered sets, one must be order-isomorphic to an initial segment of the other. This implies the existence of an order-preserving injection from one into the other. Consequently, for any two sets $A$ and $B$, assuming $\\text{AC}$, there exists an injection in at least one direction, meaning either $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$. This establishes that the relation `$\\le$` on cardinals is total. When combined with reflexivity, transitivity, and the antisymmetry guaranteed by CBS, it confirms that cardinalities are linearly ordered under the assumption of $\\text{AC}$ (i.e., in $\\text{ZFC}$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Without $\\text{AC}$, there are models in which there exist infinite sets $A$ and $B$ such that neither $|A| \\le |B|$ nor $|B| \\le |A|$, so CBS cannot be used to decide which of $|A|$ and $|B|$ is larger.**\nThis statement is correct. It is a fundamental result in modern set theory, established by Paul Cohen, that if $\\text{ZF}$ is consistent, then so is $\\text{ZF} + \\neg\\text{AC}$. In models of $\\text{ZF} + \\neg\\text{AC}$, it is possible for there to exist sets $A$ and $B$ (so-called \"incomparable cardinals\") for which there is no injection $A \\to B$ and no injection $B \\to A$. In such a scenario, the condition for comparability is not met. The CBS theorem is irrelevant to this pair of sets, as its hypothesis ($|A| \\le |B|$ and $|B| \\le |A|$) is not satisfied, and there is no basis to establish any ordering between $|A|$ and $|B|$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Cantor’s theorem that $|\\mathcal{P}(A)| > |A|$ together with CBS implies that for every pair of sets $A$ and $B$ one can always determine whether $|A| < |B|$, $|A| = |B|$, or $|A| > |B|$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Cantor's theorem demonstrates that for any set $A$, its power set $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ has a strictly greater cardinality. This is a powerful result for generating an infinite hierarchy of larger and larger cardinals ($\\text{e.g.}$, $|\\mathbb{N}| < |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})| < |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}))| < \\dots$). However, it provides no information about the comparability of two *arbitrary* sets, $A$ and $B$, which may not be related through the power set operation. The combination of Cantor's theorem and CBS does not suffice to prove the Law of Trichotomy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In $\\text{ZF}$, every surjection $B \\twoheadrightarrow A$ yields an injection $A \\hookrightarrow B$, so CBS can be applied using surjections in place of injections to compare cardinals.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The assertion that for every surjection $f: B \\to A$ there exists an injection $g: A \\to B$ is a well-known equivalent of the Axiom of Choice. To construct such an injection $g$, one must, for each element $a \\in A$, choose exactly one element from its non-empty preimage set $f^{-1}(\\{a\\})$. Performing this simultaneous selection for all $a \\in A$ requires $\\text{AC}$ if $A$ is infinite. Thus, this principle is not available in $\\text{ZF}$ alone.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. The Continuum Hypothesis by itself does not guarantee that for arbitrary $A$ and $B$ one of $|A| \\le |B|$ or $|B| \\le |A|$ holds, so without $\\text{AC}$, CBS still does not compare arbitrary cardinals even if $\\text{CH}$ is assumed.**\nThis statement is correct. The Continuum Hypothesis ($\\text{CH}$) is a specific claim about the cardinality of the continuum: it asserts there is no cardinal number strictly between $|\\mathbb{N}|$ (the cardinality of the natural numbers) and $|\\mathbb{R}| = |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})|$ (the cardinality of the real numbers). This is a statement about a particular \"gap\" in the hierarchy of infinite cardinals. It is not a general principle about the structure of the class of all cardinals. It is known that $\\text{CH}$ does not imply $\\text{AC}$. Therefore, one can have models of set theory that satisfy $\\text{ZF} + \\text{CH} + \\neg\\text{AC}$. In such models, $\\text{CH}$ is true, but there still exist pairs of cardinals that are incomparable, just as described in statement C. Thus, assuming $\\text{CH}$ is not sufficient to ensure the comparability of all cardinals.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCF}$$", "id": "3038149"}, {"introduction": "Once we assume the Axiom of Choice and establish that infinite cardinalities are linearly ordered, we can begin to explore the structure of this transfinite landscape.

This identity is true by definition and does not depend on GCH. So, the statement holds for $\\alpha=0$.\n\n2.  **Successor Step**:\n    Let $\\beta$ be an ordinal and assume the induction hypothesis: $\\beth_{\\beta} = \\aleph_{\\beta}$. We must show that $\\beth_{\\beta+1} = \\aleph_{\\beta+1}$.\n    - By the recursive definition of the beth hierarchy, $\\beth_{\\beta+1} = 2^{\\beth_{\\beta}}$.\n    - Applying the induction hypothesis, we substitute $\\beth_{\\beta}$ with $\\aleph_{\\beta}$: $\\beth_{\\beta+1} = 2^{\\aleph_{\\beta}}$.\n    - Now, we invoke the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), which states that for any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, $2^{\\kappa} = \\kappa^{+}$.\n    - Setting $\\kappa = \\aleph_{\\beta}$ (which is an infinite cardinal), GCH gives $2^{\\aleph_{\\beta}} = (\\aleph_{\\beta})^{+}$.\n    - By the definition of the aleph hierarchy, the successor cardinal of $\\aleph_{\\beta}$ is $\\aleph_{\\beta+1}$. That is, $(\\aleph_{\\beta})^{+} = \\aleph_{\\beta+1}$.\n    - Combining these steps, we have $\\beth_{\\beta+1} = 2^{\\aleph_{\\beta}} = (\\aleph_{\\beta})^{+} = \\aleph_{\\beta+1}$.\n    - Thus, the statement holds for successor ordinals.\n\n3.  **Limit Step**:\n    Let $\\lambda$ be a limit ordinal. Assume the induction hypothesis: for all $\\beta < \\lambda$, $\\beth_{\\beta} = \\aleph_{\\beta}$. We must show that $\\beth_{\\lambda} = \\aleph_{\\lambda}$.\n    - By the definition of the beth hierarchy for limit ordinals, $\\beth_{\\lambda} = \\sup\\{ \\beth_{\\beta} : \\beta < \\lambda \\}$.\n    - Applying the induction hypothesis to each $\\beth_{\\beta}$ in the set, we get $\\beth_{\\lambda} = \\sup\\{ \\aleph_{\\beta} : \\beta < \\lambda \\}$.\n    - By the definition of the aleph hierarchy for limit ordinals, $\\aleph_{\\lambda} = \\sup\\{ \\aleph_{\\beta} : \\beta < \\lambda \\}$.\n    - Therefore, $\\beth_{\\lambda} = \\aleph_{\\lambda}$.\n    - Thus, the statement holds for limit ordinals.\n\nBy the principle of transfinite induction, we have proven that assuming GCH, $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha}$ for all ordinals $\\alpha$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\beth_{1} = |\\mathbb{R}|$, and assuming GCH, for every ordinal $\\alpha$, $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha}$.**\n- The first part, $\\beth_{1} = |\\mathbb{R}|$, is correct as derived above ($\\beth_1 = 2^{\\aleph_0} = |\\mathbb{R}|$).\n- The second part, \"assuming GCH, for every ordinal $\\alpha$, $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha}$\", is also correct as proven by transfinite induction above.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. $\\beth_{1} = \\aleph_{1}$ is provable in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) from Cantor’s theorem, and assuming GCH one has $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}$ for all ordinals $\\alpha$.**\n- The first part states that $\\beth_{1} = \\aleph_{1}$ is provable in ZFC. This is false. $\\beth_{1} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, so the statement is equivalent to $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1$, which is the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). The work of Gödel and Cohen established that CH is independent of ZFC; it can neither be proven nor disproven within ZFC. Cantor's theorem only proves $\\beth_{1} = 2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0$, which implies $\\beth_1 \\ge \\aleph_1$. It does not prove equality.\n- The second part states that under GCH, $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}$. This is false. As shown in our derivation, GCH implies $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha}$. For the base case $\\alpha=0$, we have $\\beth_0=\\aleph_0$, whereas this option claims $\\beth_0=\\aleph_1$, a contradiction.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. $\\beth_{1}$ is the unique cardinal $\\kappa$ such that $\\kappa^{\\aleph_{0}} = \\kappa$, hence $\\beth_{1} = \\aleph_{0}$, and assuming GCH one has $\\beth_{\\lambda} = \\aleph_{\\lambda}$ only for limit ordinals $\\lambda$.**\n- The first part makes two claims. First, it characterizes $\\beth_1$ via $\\kappa^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$. For $\\kappa = \\beth_1 = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, we have $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, so $\\beth_1$ does satisfy this equation. However, the clause \"hence $\\beth_{1} = \\aleph_{0}$\" is a direct contradiction. By Cantor's theorem, $\\beth_1 = 2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0$.\n- The second part claims that under GCH, $\\beth_{\\lambda} = \\aleph_{\\lambda}$ holds *only* for limit ordinals $\\lambda$. This is false. Our induction proof showed it holds for the base case $\\alpha=0$ and for all successor ordinals as well.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. $\\beth_{1} = |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R})|$, and assuming GCH one proves by transfinite induction that $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}$ for all successor ordinals $\\alpha$ but not for limit ordinals.**\n- The first part claims $\\beth_{1} = |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R})|$. This is false. We have $\\beth_{1} = 2^{\\aleph_{0}} = |\\mathbb{R}|$. The cardinality of the power set of the reals is $|\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R})| = 2^{|\\mathbb{R}|} = 2^{\\beth_1} = \\beth_2$.\n- The second part claims that under GCH, $\\beth_{\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}$ for successor ordinals. This is false. For a successor ordinal $\\alpha = \\beta+1$, GCH implies $\\beth_{\\beta+1} = \\aleph_{\\beta+1}$, not $\\aleph_{(\\beta+1)+1} = \\aleph_{\\beta+2}$.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3038137"}, {"introduction": "The Axiom of Choice guarantees that a well-ordering of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ must exist, but this raises a subtle and profound question: can we actually define or construct such an ordering?

I will now proceed with the solution and evaluation of each option.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to demonstrate why a well-ordering of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ cannot be an analytic set (and therefore cannot be a Borel set, since every Borel set is analytic). The reasoning relies on combining the properties of well-orderings, the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$, and the provided Boundedness Theorem for analytic well-founded relations.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a relation $W \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ which is both a strict well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$ and an analytic set.\n\n1.  The space $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Polish space.\n2.  By definition, a strict well-ordering $W$ is a well-founded relation.\n3.  We are assuming $W$ is an analytic set.\n4.  The conditions for the Boundedness Theorem are met: $W$ is an analytic, well-founded relation on a Polish space $X = \\mathbb{R}$.\n5.  The theorem states that there exists a countable a ordinal $\\beta < \\omega_1$ such that the range of the rank function is bounded by $\\beta$. That is, for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $r_W(x) < \\beta$.\n6.  This defines a rank function $r_W: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\beta$. Note that an ordinal $\\beta$ can be identified with the set of all ordinals smaller than it, so the codomain is the set $\\beta = \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathrm{Ord} : \\alpha < \\beta\\}$.\n7.  For a strict well-ordering, the rank function is injective. To see this, let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $x \\neq y$. Since $W$ is a total ordering, either $y \\, W \\, x$ or $x \\, W \\, y$. Assume $y \\, W \\, x$. By the definition of the rank function, $r_W(x) = \\sup\\{ r_W(z) + 1 : z \\, W \\, x \\}$. The set includes the term $r_W(y)+1$. Therefore, $r_W(x) \\geq r_W(y) + 1$. This implies $r_W(x) > r_W(y)$. Thus, the function $r_W$ is injective.\n8.  The existence of an injective function $r_W: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\beta$ implies that the cardinality of the domain is less than or equal to the cardinality of the codomain: $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\beta|$.\n9.  The ordinal $\\beta$ is a countable ordinal, meaning $\\beta < \\omega_1$. By definition, the cardinality of a countable ordinal is at most countable, i.e., $|\\beta| \\le \\aleph_0$.\n10. Combining these results, we get $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le \\aleph_0$.\n11. However, Cantor's theorem states that $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, meaning $|\\mathbb{R}| > \\aleph_0$.\n12. The conclusion $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le \\aleph_0$ contradicts the fact that $|\\mathbb{R}| > \\aleph_0$.\n13. Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. There cannot be an analytic well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n14. Since every Borel set is analytic, it follows that there cannot be a Borel well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis completes the derivation. Now, I will evaluate each option against this correct line of reasoning.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. By boundedness for analytic well-founded relations, any analytic well-order $W$ on a Polish space has ranks bounded by some countable ordinal $\\beta < \\omega_1$. In a well-order, distinct elements have distinct ranks, so the domain must inject into $\\beta$ and is therefore countable. Since Cantor’s theorem says $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, no analytic (hence no Borel) well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$ exists.**\n\nThis option perfectly encapsulates the correct logical argument derived above. It correctly applies the Boundedness Theorem, correctly identifies that the rank function for a well-ordering is injective (\"distinct elements have distinct ranks\"), and correctly uses this to establish an injection from the domain ($\\mathbb{R}$) into a countable set ($\\beta$). This implies the domain is countable, which directly contradicts Cantor's theorem. The conclusion is sound.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. By the Continuum Hypothesis, there is no well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$ at all, so a Borel or analytic well-order of $\\mathbb{R}$ is impossible.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Axiom of Choice (a standard axiom in ZFC set theory) implies the Well-Ordering Principle, which asserts that every set, including $\\mathbb{R}$, can be well-ordered. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is the statement $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\aleph_1$. CH is independent of ZFC and does not forbid the well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$; in fact, it provides a specific order type, $\\omega_1$, for such a well-ordering. The premise of this option is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Every uncountable Borel subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ contains a perfect subset, and perfect subsets cannot be linearly ordered, so a Borel well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$ is impossible.**\n\nThis argument contains a fatal flaw. The statement that \"perfect subsets cannot be linearly ordered\" is false. A perfect set (e.g., the Cantor set or the interval $[0,1]$) is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ and inherits the standard linear ordering from $\\mathbb{R}$. Any subset of a linearly ordered set is itself linearly ordered by the restricted order. While it is true that an uncountable Borel set cannot be *well-ordered* by a *Borel* relation (a consequence of the main theorem being discussed), the reason given in the option is fallacious.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A Borel relation has only countably many vertical sections, so for a Borel well-order $W$ and each $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the initial segment $\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R} : y \\, W \\, x\\}$ is countable, contradicting the fact that $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$.**\n\nThe premise \"A Borel relation has only countably many vertical sections\" is false. For a relation $R \\subseteq X \\times Y$, the vertical section at $x_0 \\in X$ is $R_{x_0} = \\{y \\in Y : (x_0, y) \\in R\\}$. Consider the Borel relation $W = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} : x=y\\}$, which is the diagonal. It has uncountably many vertical sections (one for each $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, each section being a singleton). The reasoning in this option is built on a false premise.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If there were an analytic well-ordering of $\\mathbb{R}$, then $\\mathbb{R}$ would inject into $\\omega_1$, contradicting Cantor’s theorem that $|\\mathbb{R}| > |\\mathbb{N}|$.**\n\nThis argument is imprecise and its conclusion is flawed. It correctly deduces from the Boundedness Theorem that there is an injection from $\\mathbb{R}$ into the set of all countable ordinals, $\\omega_1$. This implies $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\omega_1| = \\aleph_1$. However, it then claims this finding contradicts Cantor's theorem, $|\\mathbb{R}| > |\\mathbb{N}| = \\aleph_0$. The statement $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le \\aleph_1$ does *not* contradict $|\\mathbb{R}| > \\aleph_0$; this is because $\\aleph_1 > \\aleph_0$. The argument fails to reach a contradiction. Option A is more precise by noting the injection is into a *countable* ordinal $\\beta$, which is a *countable* set, thus implying $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le \\aleph_0$, which properly contradicts Cantor's theorem. Option E loses the crucial detail that makes the contradiction work.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3038132"}]}
