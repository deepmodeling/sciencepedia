Natural deduction, its rules ($\\to$I, $\\to$E), and the concepts of scope, assumption, and discharge are standard. The specific restriction on $\\to$I described as \"scope violation\" is a crucial aspect of many formal ND systems (e.g., those by Prawitz or in Fitch-style systems), where it's required that the consequent of the implication actually depends on the assumption being discharged. This prevents vacuous applications of the rule.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear, unambiguous derivation and a precise (if subtle) rule for its evaluation. A unique and logically sound analysis is possible.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, complete for the task, and poses a standard, non-trivial question about the mechanics of a formal proof system.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nWe will analyze the derivation by tracking the dependencies of each line. A formula's dependencies are the set of non-discharged assumptions (premises) used to derive it.\n\n-   Line $1$: $A$. This is a premise. Dependencies: $\\{A^{(a)}\\}$.\n-   Line $2$: $A \\to B$. This is a premise. Dependencies: $\\{A \\to B\\}$.\n-   We now begin a subderivation for an application of $\\to$I.\n    -   Line $3$: $A$. This is a temporary assumption for the subderivation. Dependencies: $\\{A^{(h)}\\}$.\n    -   Line $4$: $A$. This is a reiteration of the formula at line $1$. Its dependencies are inherited from line $1$. Dependencies: $\\{A^{(a)}\\}$.\n    -   Line $5$: $B$. This is derived by $\\to$E from line $4$ ($A$) and line $2$ ($A \\to B$). The dependencies of $B$ are the union of the dependencies of the formulas it was derived from.\n        -   Dependencies of line $4$: $\\{A^{(a)}\\}$.\n        -   Dependencies of line $2$: $\\{A \\to B\\}$.\n        -   Therefore, the dependencies of line $5$ are $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\}$. Critically, the formula $B$ at this line does *not* depend on the assumption $A^{(h)}$ from line $3$, as $A^{(h)}$ was never used in its derivation.\n-   We now conclude the subderivation and apply $\\to$I.\n    -   Line $6$: $A \\to B$. The rule $\\to$I is applied to the subderivation spanning lines $3$-$5$. This allows us to infer the conditional whose antecedent is the assumption at line $3$ ($A$) and whose consequent is the final formula of the subderivation at line $5$ ($B$). The rule states that the assumption $A^{(h)}$ is discharged.\n    -   The dependencies of the resulting formula $A \\to B$ are the dependencies of the formula $B$ at line $5$, with the discharged assumption $A^{(h)}$ removed from the set.\n    -   Dependencies of line $5$: $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\}$.\n    -   Discharged assumption: $A^{(h)}$.\n    -   Resulting dependencies for line $6$: $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\} \\setminus \\{A^{(h)}\\}$. Since $A^{(h)}$ is not in the set $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\}$, the resulting dependency set is unchanged: $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\}$.\n\nThe final derivation claims to have proven $A \\to B$ from the set of premises $\\{A, A \\to B\\}$. This is denoted $\\{A, A \\to B\\} \\vdash A \\to B$. Now we must check this against the \"scope violation\" rule.\n\nThe rule states that a violation occurs if \"the resulting conditional depends on an undischarged occurrence of its antecedent\".\n-   The \"resulting conditional\" is the formula $A \\to B$ at line $6$.\n-   Its \"antecedent\" is the formula $A$.\n-   The dependency set of the conditional at line $6$ is $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\}$. This set contains $A^{(a)}$, which is the premise from line $1$—an \"undischarged occurrence of its antecedent\".\n-   Therefore, the condition for a scope violation is met. The application of $\\to$I at line $6$ is invalid under the specified restriction. The derivation fails because the proof of the consequent, $B$, did not depend on the assumption $A^{(h)}$ that was meant to be discharged. Instead, it depended on an external premise $A^{(a)}$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The application of $\\to$I at line $6$ is invalid because the derivation of $B$ at line $5$ depends on the undischarged occurrence $A^{(a)}$ from line $1$ rather than on the assumed occurrence $A^{(h)}$ from line $3$. Hence, the resulting conditional $A \\to B$ would still depend on an undischarged occurrence of its own antecedent, violating the scope restriction of $\\to$I.**\nThis option accurately describes the flaw we identified. The derivation of $B$ at line $5$ depends on $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\}$, not on $A^{(h)}$. Consequently, the final formula $A \\to B$ at line $6$ inherits the dependency on $A^{(a)}$, which is an undischarged premise that is identical to its antecedent. This is a textbook example of the kind of vacuous implication introduction that dependency-tracking ND systems are designed to forbid.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The application is valid, because $\\to$I permits discharging any assumption whose formula matches the antecedent, regardless of whether the proof of the consequent appealed to an undischarged occurrence of that same antecedent outside the subderivation.**\nThis option claims the application is valid, which contradicts the problem's premise that a scope violation exists and our analysis. It describes a more liberal (and often disallowed) version of the $\\to$I rule. This contradicts the \"standard ND restriction\" mentioned in the problem prompt.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The application fails because $\\to$E cannot be used inside a subderivation; only outside subderivations may $\\to$E be applied.**\nThis is a false statement about natural deduction. All introduction and elimination rules can be used within any scope (main derivation or subderivation), provided their prerequisite formulas are accessible in that scope. Line $5$ is a valid application of $\\to$E on the accessible lines $2$ and $4$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The application fails because reiteration of formulas from outside a subderivation is never permitted; one may only use formulas introduced within the current subderivation.**\nThis is a false statement about natural deduction. The ability to access and reiterate formulas from an outer scope is essential for subderivations to be useful. The reiteration at line $4$ is a syntactically valid step. The error in the proof occurs later, at line $6$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The application is valid, but the dependency bookkeeping is off: the proper dependency set of the conditional at line $6$ should be only $\\{A \\to B\\}$, so no scope violation occurs.**\nThis option makes two errors. First, it claims the application is valid, which is false under the specified restriction. Second, it incorrectly calculates the dependencies. As shown in our analysis, the dependencies of line $6$ are $\\{A^{(a)}, A \\to B\\}$. There is no rule that would remove the dependency on $A^{(a)}$. Because the dependency on $A^{(a)}$ remains, the scope violation does occur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies and explains the violation is A.

The problem is objective, complete, and does not contain any contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze the validity of the proposed derivation in applying the existential elimination ($\\exists E$) rule. The structure of a correct $\\exists E$ application is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\exists x\\,P(x) \\\\\n\\quad \\boxed{\n    \\begin{array}{l}\n    P(c) \\quad \\text{Assumption, with 'c' fresh} \\\\\n    \\vdots \\\\\n    R \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n} \\quad \\text{where 'c' is not in R} \\\\\n\\hline\nR \\quad (\\exists E)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe proposed derivation attempts to follow this structure:\n1.  Premise: $\\exists x\\,P(x)$\n2.  Start subderivation: Assume $P(a)$. Here, the constant $a$ plays the role of the eigenvariable $c$.\n3.  Derive $Q(a)$ within the subderivation. Here, the formula $Q(a)$ plays the role of the conclusion $R$ of the subderivation.\n4.  Conclude $Q(a)$ by $\\exists E$.\n\nNow, we must check if this application satisfies the eigenvariable condition. The crucial part of the condition is that the eigenvariable must not occur in the conclusion of the subderivation.\n-   Eigenvariable: $a$\n-   Conclusion of subderivation: $Q(a)$\n\nThe eigenvariable $a$ clearly appears in the formula $Q(a)$. This is a direct violation of the eigenvariable condition for existential elimination. Therefore, the proposed derivation is invalid.\n\nThe reason for this restriction is to ensure logical soundness. Knowing $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ tells us that *some* element in the domain has property $P$, but it doesn't tell us *which* one. By assuming $P(a)$, we give a temporary name, $a$, to this unknown element to see what follows. However, any conclusion we draw must be independent of this specific name, because we never knew which element it was in the first place. If our conclusion is $Q(a)$, it is a statement about that specific temporary witness, not a general truth that can be asserted outside the context of that assumption. The inference from \"something is a P\" to \"the specific individual 'a' is a Q\" is a non-sequitur, unless there are other premises linking $P$, $Q$, and $a$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The derivation is invalid because existential elimination requires that the constant introduced in the subderivation not occur in the final conclusion; here $a$ occurs in $Q(a)$. A countermodel shows the unsoundness: take a domain with two elements, interpret $a$ as one element $d$, let $P$ hold of a different element $e$ but not of $d$, so $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is true while $Q(a)$ can be false; hence the inference from $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ to $Q(a)$ is not valid. The eigenvariable condition forces the subderivation to derive a conclusion $R$ that is independent of $a$, ensuring soundness.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the derivation is invalid due to the violation of the eigenvariable condition: the constant $a$ from the assumption $P(a)$ appears in the conclusion $Q(a)$. It then provides a perfect countermodel to demonstrate unsoundness. Let the domain be $\\{d, e\\}$. Let $I(a)=d$. Let the extension of $P$ be $\\{e\\}$ and the extension of $Q$ be $\\emptyset$.\n-   Premise $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is true because $P(e)$ is true.\n-   Conclusion $Q(a)$ means $Q(d)$, which is false because the extension of $Q$ is empty.\nSince the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the inference is invalid. The final sentence correctly explains the rationale for the rule.\n\n**Verdict for A:** Correct.\n\n**B. The derivation is valid provided $a$ is a new constant and does not occur in the premise $\\exists x\\,P(x)$, because the existential premise guarantees there is some witness and we may name it by $a$.**\n\nThis option incorrectly claims the derivation is valid. It correctly states the conditions for *starting* the subderivation (choosing a fresh name for the witness), but it completely ignores the crucial condition on the *conclusion* of that subderivation. The ability to name a witness is temporary and for the purpose of reasoning within the subproof; one cannot export a conclusion that depends on that name.\n\n**Verdict for B:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The derivation is valid if one eventually applies universal introduction to $Q(a)$ to conclude $\\forall x\\,Q(x)$, thereby removing the dependence on $a$.**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two main reasons. First, it proposes changing the conclusion of the overall derivation. Second, the proposed new step, applying universal introduction ($\\forall I$) to $Q(a)$, is itself invalid in this context. To infer $\\forall x\\,Q(x)$ from $Q(a)$, the constant $a$ must be arbitrary, meaning it cannot appear in any undischarged assumptions. However, $Q(a)$ was derived under the assumption $P(a)$, which contains $a$. Thus, $a$ is not arbitrary, and $\\forall I$ cannot be applied.\n\n**Verdict for C:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The derivation becomes valid if we add the premise $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\to Q(x))$, because from $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ we may then conclude $Q(a)$.**\n\nThis option incorrectly claims that adding the premise $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\to Q(x))$ makes the derivation of $Q(a)$ valid. With this new premise, we can construct a valid derivation, but its conclusion will be $\\exists x\\,Q(x)$, not $Q(a)$. The derivation would proceed as follows:\n1.  $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ (Premise)\n2.  $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\to Q(x))$ (Premise)\n3.  Assume $P(c)$ for a fresh $c$. (Start of $\\exists E$ subderivation)\n4.  From (2), get $P(c)\\to Q(c)$ by $\\forall E$.\n5.  From (3) and (4), get $Q(c)$ by $\\to E$.\n6.  From (5), get $\\exists y\\,Q(y)$ by $\\exists I$.\n7.  Now, the conclusion of the subderivation is $\\exists y\\,Q(y)$. This formula does not contain the eigenvariable $c$. So we can validly conclude $\\exists y\\,Q(y)$ by $\\exists E$, discharging the assumption at (3).\nWe cannot conclude $Q(a)$, as the countermodel in the analysis for option A shows: even with the added premise $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\to Q(x))$, if the witness for $P$ is not $a$, we cannot conclude $Q(a)$.\n\n**Verdict for D:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3047462"}]}
