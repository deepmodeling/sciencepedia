This first exercise strips the problem down to its core by considering the simplest possible existential sentence, $\\exists x\\,P(x)$, in a language devoid of constants or functions. By working from first principles, you will discover why Skolemization necessitates the introduction of a new symbol—a Skolem constant—to serve as a witness when no other terms are available. [@problem_id:3053199]", "problem": "Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be a first-order language in the sense of First-Order Logic (FOL) whose non-logical symbols consist of exactly one unary predicate symbol $P$ and no constant symbols and no function symbols.

In particular, justify from first principles why, in this language with no constants and no function symbols, the Skolemization of $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ requires the introduction of a new symbol, and explain why no existing symbol can serve as a witness term.\n\nConclude by writing the explicit Skolemized formula of $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ in $\\mathcal{L}$ extended by the necessary Skolem symbol. Your final answer must be the Skolemized formula only, written as a single closed-form symbolic expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Skolem normal form (SNF) for the first-order logic (FOL) sentence $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ in a language $\\mathcal{L}$ whose signature consists of a single unary predicate symbol $P$ and no constant or function symbols. The derivation must be justified from first principles.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given language $\\mathcal{L}$. The signature of $\\mathcal{L}$ contains:\n- Predicate symbols: $\\{P\\}$, where $P$ is unary.\n- Constant symbols: $\\emptyset$ (the empty set).\n- Function symbols: $\\emptyset$ (the empty set).\n\nThe problem asks for the Skolem normal form of the sentence $\\phi = \\exists x\\,P(x)$. A formula is in Skolem normal form if it is in prenex normal form and all its quantifiers are universal. The process of converting a formula to an equisatisfiable one in SNF is called Skolemization.\n\nThe general principle of Skolemization is as follows: consider a formula in prenex normal form, $Q_1 y_1 \\dots Q_n y_n\\, \\psi$, where $\\psi$ is quantifier-free. We scan the quantifiers from left to right. When we encounter the first existential quantifier, say $Q_k = \\exists$ (so $Q_k y_k = \\exists x_k$), we identify all the universal quantifiers that precede it, say $\\forall z_1, \\dots, \\forall z_m$ where $m \\ge 0$. We then introduce a new $m$-ary function symbol, $f$, not present in the language's signature. This is called a Skolem function. We replace every free occurrence of the variable $x_k$ in the matrix $\\psi$ with the term $f(z_1, \\dots, z_m)$. Finally, we remove the quantifier $\\exists x_k$. This process is repeated until no existential quantifiers remain.\n\nLet us apply this principle to the sentence $\\phi = \\exists x\\,P(x)$.\n1. The formula is already in prenex normal form.\n2. The outermost quantifier is $\\exists x$.\n3. We must identify the universally quantified variables whose scope contains this existential quantifier. In this case, there are no preceding universal quantifiers. The number of such variables is $m=0$.\n4. According to the principle, we must introduce a new function symbol of arity $m=0$. A $0$-ary function symbol is, by definition, a constant symbol. Let us call this new constant symbol $c$. This new symbol $c$ is a Skolem constant.\n5. We then replace all occurrences of the variable $x$ in the matrix of the formula (which is $P(x)$) with this new constant symbol $c$. This yields the expression $P(c)$.\n6. Finally, we remove the quantifier $\\exists x$.\n\nThe resulting formula is $P(c)$. This formula has no quantifiers, so it is vacuously in Skolem normal form. The new formula, $P(c)$, is in the extended language $\\mathcal{L'} = \\mathcal{L} \\cup \\{c\\}$. The sentences $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ and $P(c)$ are equisatisfiable, meaning $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is satisfiable if and only if $P(c)$ is satisfiable.\n\nThe core of the problem is to justify from first principles why a new symbol *must* be introduced and why no existing symbol in $\\mathcal{L}$ can serve as the witness.\n\nThe process of Skolemization replaces an existentially quantified variable with a *term* that serves as a witness to the existence asserted by the quantifier. For the result to remain a sentence (a formula with no free variables), the variable $x$ in $P(x)$ must be replaced by a *ground term*, which is a term containing no variables.\n\nLet us analyze the set of available terms in the original language $\\mathcal{L}$. The inductive definition of a term in FOL states that a term is either:\n(i) a variable (e.g., $x, y, z, \\dots$),\n(ii) a constant symbol, or\n(iii) an expression of the form $f(t_1, \\dots, t_n)$, where $f$ is an $n$-ary function symbol and $t_1, \\dots, t_n$ are terms.\n\nThe problem statement explicitly specifies that the language $\\mathcal{L}$ has no constant symbols and no function symbols. Therefore, constructions (ii) and (iii) are not possible in $\\mathcal{L}$. The only terms that can be formed in $\\mathcal{L}$ are variables, as per rule (i).\n\nSince the only terms available in $\\mathcal{L}$ are variables, there are no *ground terms* in $\\mathcal{L}$. If we were to attempt to use an existing \"symbol\" from $\\mathcal{L}$ to replace $x$, we would have to use a variable, say $y$. This would transform $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ into $P(y)$. However, $P(y)$ is not a sentence; it is a formula with a free variable $y$. The truth value of $P(y)$ depends on the assignment to $y$, whereas the truth value of the original sentence $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is fixed for a given interpretation. Thus, $P(y)$ is not equisatisfiable with $\\exists x\\,P(x)$, and the Skolemization procedure requires the resulting formula to be a sentence if the original formula was a sentence.\n\nBecause the language $\\mathcal{L}$ lacks the syntactic resources to form a ground term to act as a witness for $x$, we are forced to extend the language. The Skolemization procedure mandates this extension by introducing a new symbol. In our case, since there are no preceding universal quantifiers, a new $0$-ary function symbol (a constant symbol) $c$ is added to the signature. This new symbol $c$ is a ground term in the extended language $\\mathcal{L'}$.\n\nIn summary:\n1. Skolemization of $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ requires substituting $x$ with a ground term to produce a new sentence.\n2. The language $\\mathcal{L}$, having no constant or function symbols, contains no ground terms.\n3. Therefore, to perform Skolemization, the language must be extended with a new symbol that is a ground term.\n4. The procedure for an existential quantifier not within the scope of any universal quantifiers dictates the introduction of a new constant symbol, let's call it $c$.\n\nBy substituting $x$ with $c$ in $P(x)$ and dropping the quantifier $\\exists x$, we obtain the Skolemized formula.\n\nThe explicit Skolemized formula of $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is therefore $P(c)$, where $c$ is a newly introduced constant symbol.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{P(c)}\n$$", "id": "3053199"}, {"introduction": "Correctly capturing variable dependencies is the most crucial aspect of Skolemization.

The arguments of a Skolem function are the universally quantified variables in whose scope the existential quantifier lies. A crucial subtlety arises when a formula contains multiple existential quantifiers within the scope of universal quantifiers, particularly within logical connectives like conjunction.\n\nA naive conversion to prenex normal form (PNF) can introduce artificial dependencies. For the given formula $\\varphi$, a standard PNF conversion might yield $\\forall x \\exists y \\exists z (P(x,y) \\land Q(x,z))$. If one were to Skolemize this PNF from left to right, one would first replace $y$ with $f(x)$ to get $\\forall x \\exists z (P(x,f(x)) \\land Q(x,z))$. Then, one would replace $z$ with a function of all universally quantified variables in its scope, which now includes $x$ and also involves the term $f(x)$ if we are not careful. A mechanical process might yield $g(x, f(x))$, suggesting $z$ depends on the choice of $y$. This is incorrect, as the original formula $\\forall x\\,(\\exists y\\,P(x,y)\\land \\exists z\\,Q(x,z))$ asserts that for any $x$, there exists a $y$ and there exists a $z$ independently. The choice of $y$ depends only on $x$, and the choice of $z$ also depends only on $x$.\n\nTo preserve this independence, we must use a method that respects the structure of the formula. This is the explicit instruction in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Convert $\\varphi$ to a logically equivalent form for independent Skolemization.**\n\nThe core of this step is to use the logical equivalence that allows the distribution of a universal quantifier over a conjunction: $\\forall v\\, (\\psi_1(v) \\land \\psi_2(v)) \\equiv (\\forall v\\, \\psi_1(v)) \\land (\\forall v\\, \\psi_2(v))$.\n\nThe given sentence is $\\varphi = \\forall x\\,(\\exists y\\,P(x,y)\\land \\exists z\\,Q(x,z))$.\nLet's define two subformulas depending on $x$:\n$\\psi_1(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\,P(x,y)$\n$\\psi_2(x) \\equiv \\exists z\\,Q(x,z)$\n\nThen, $\\varphi$ can be written as $\\forall x\\,(\\psi_1(x) \\land \\psi_2(x))$.\nApplying the distributive equivalence, we get:\n$\\varphi \\equiv (\\forall x\\,\\psi_1(x)) \\land (\\forall x\\,\\psi_2(x))$\n\nSubstituting the definitions of $\\psi_1(x)$ and $\\psi_2(x)$ back, we obtain the logically equivalent form:\n$(\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,P(x,y)) \\land (\\forall x\\,\\exists z\\,Q(x,z))$\n\nThis form makes the independence of the two existential claims explicit. Each is a self-contained statement universally quantified by $x$. This is the form required by the first part of the problem.\n\n**Step 2: Skolemize the result.**\n\nSkolemization is now performed on the formula $(\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,P(x,y)) \\land (\\forall x\\,\\exists z\\,Q(x,z))$. We can Skolemize each conjunct separately.\n\nFor the first conjunct, $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,P(x,y)$:\nThe existential quantifier $\\exists y$ is in the scope of one universal quantifier, $\\forall x$. Therefore, we introduce a new Skolem function symbol, let's call it $f$, of arity $1$. We replace the existentially quantified variable $y$ with the term $f(x)$. This eliminates the existential quantifier. The Skolemized form of the first conjunct is:\n$\\forall x\\,P(x,f(x))$\n\nFor the second conjunct, $\\forall x\\,\\exists z\\,Q(x,z)$:\nThe existential quantifier $\\exists z$ is also in the scope of one universal quantifier, $\\forall x$. This is a separate existential claim, so we must introduce a new, distinct Skolem function symbol, let's call it $g$, also of arity $1$. We replace the existentially quantified variable $z$ with the term $g(x)$. The Skolemized form of the second conjunct is:\n$\\forall x\\,Q(x,g(x))$\n\nCombining the Skolemized conjuncts, we get the Skolem form of the entire sentence:\n$(\\forall x\\,P(x,f(x))) \\land (\\forall x\\,Q(x,g(x)))$\n\nThis can be rewritten by factoring out the universal quantifier to get a single universal sentence, which is the standard form for a Skolemized formula (a Skolem normal form sentence):\n$\\forall x\\,(P(x,f(x)) \\land Q(x,g(x)))$\n\nThis is the final Skolemized universal sentence. The function $f(x)$ provides the witness for $y$, and the function $g(x)$ provides the witness for $z$. Both depend only on $x$, correctly reflecting the dependencies in the original formula.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number and arities of Skolem functions.**\n\nFrom the Skolemization process in Step 2, we can identify the properties of the introduced Skolem functions.\n$1$. The Skolem function symbols introduced are $f$ and $g$. These are two distinct symbols. Thus, the number of distinct Skolem function symbols is $2$.\n$2$. The arity of a Skolem function is the number of universal quantifiers that bind the existential quantifier it replaces.\n   - The function $f$ was introduced for the existential quantifier $\\exists y$ in the subformula $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,P(x,y)$. The only universal quantifier governing $\\exists y$ is $\\forall x$. Therefore, the arity of $f$ is $1$.\n   - The function $g$ was introduced for the existential quantifier $\\exists z$ in the subformula $\\forall x\\,\\exists z\\,Q(x,z)$. The only universal quantifier governing $\\exists z$ is $\\forall x$. Therefore, the arity of $g$ is $1$.\n\nThe multiset of the arities of the Skolem functions is $\\{1, 1\\}$.\nThe problem asks for these arities to be listed in nondecreasing order. Since they are equal, the order is simply $1, 1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the number of symbols, followed by their arities in nondecreasing order.\n- Number of symbols: $2$\n- Arities: $1$, $1$\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3053044"}, {"introduction": "The rules of Skolemization are not arbitrary; they are essential for preserving the satisfiability of a formula.

Thus, $\\exists y$ is correctly replaced by a function $f(x)$.\n-   The variable $w$ is in the scope of $\\forall x$ and $\\forall z$. Thus, $\\exists w$ must be replaced by a function of two variables, $g(x,z)$.\n-   The correct Skolem Normal Form (SNF) of $\\Psi$, which is equi-satisfiable with $\\Psi$, is $\\Psi_{\\text{SNF}} := \\forall x\\, \\forall z\\, R(x, f(x), z, g(x,z))$.\n\nThe student incorrectly used a unary function $g(x)$ for $w$, yielding $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}} := \\forall x\\, \\forall z\\, R(x, f(x), z, g(x))$. This assumes that the choice of $w$ depends only on $x$ and not on $z$.\n\nWe are looking for a structure (domain $D$ and interpretation of $R$) that is a model of $\\Psi$ but is not a model of $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ for any choice of a unary function $g: D \\to D$.\n\nA structure $\\mathcal{M}$ is a countermodel if:\n1.  $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Psi$. This means for every $a \\in D$, there exists a $b \\in D$ such that for every $c \\in D$, there exists a $d \\in D$ where $R(a,b,c,d)$ is true.\n2.

This means for any function $g$, there exist elements $a, c \\in D$ such that $R(a, f(a), c, g(a))$ is false.\n\nThe key to finding such a countermodel is to define $R$ such that the choice of $w$ must depend on $z$ in a way that cannot be captured by a function that only depends on $x$.\n\nLet's evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A. Domain $D=\\{0,1\\}$.

The choice of $y$ does not affect the condition $w=z$, so we can pick any, say $y=0$.\n    -   Now, take any $z \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n    -   We need to find a $w \\in \\{0,1\\}$ such that $w=z$. We can simply choose $w=z$. Since $z$ is in the domain $\\{0,1\\}$, our choice for $w$ is also in the domain.\n    -   Since for any $x$ and $z$ we can find appropriate $y$ and $w$, the sentence $\\Psi$ is true in this structure.\n\n2.  **Check if $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ can be falsified for all $g$**:\n    The sentence $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ becomes $\\forall x\\, \\forall z\\, R(x, f(x), z, g(x))$, which under this interpretation is $\\forall x \\in D, \\forall z \\in D, g(x) = z$.\n    The option states that the interpretation of $f$ can be any unary function. This is correct as $y$ does not appear in the \"iff\" condition for $R$.\n    Let's analyze the statement $\\forall x \\in \\{0,1\\}, \\forall z \\in \\{0,1\\}, g(x) = z$.\n    This statement asserts that for any chosen $x$, the value $g(x)$ must be equal to every possible value of $z$.\n    Let's pick $x=0$. The statement requires $\\forall z \\in \\{0,1\\}, g(0) = z$. This means we must have both $g(0)=0$ and $g(0)=1$. This is impossible, as a function must assign a unique output to each input, and $0 \\neq 1$.\n    The same problem occurs if we pick $x=1$. We would need $g(1)=0$ and $g(1)=1$.\n    Therefore, for any unary function $g: \\{0,1\\} \\to \\{0,1\\}$, the statement $\\forall x\\, \\forall z\\, (g(x)=z)$ is false. It fails because the domain has more than one element over which $z$ is quantified.\n    This structure satisfies $\\Psi$ and ensures that $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ is false for any possible interpretation of the unary function $g$. Thus, it is a valid countermodel.\n\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**Option B. Domain $D=\\{d\\}$ (a singleton). Interpret $R$ so that $R(x,y,z,w)$ holds if and only if $w=z$.**\n\n1.  **Check if $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ is true**:\n    The option claims this makes $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ true. Let's check.\n    In a singleton domain, all variables $x, y, z, w$ must be equal to $d$.\n    The only possible functions are $f(d)=d$ and $g(d)=d$.\n    $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ becomes $\\forall x \\forall z (g(x)=z)$. With $x=d$ and $z=d$, this asserts $g(d)=d$, which is true.\n    Since $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ is true in this structure (with the only possible interpretation for $g$), it cannot be a countermodel that shows the unsoundness of the inference. A countermodel requires $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ to be false. The trivial nature of a singleton domain masks the error in dependency.\n\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C.

Interpret $R$ so that $R(x,y,z,w)$ holds if and only if $w=y$.**\n\n1.  **Check if $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ can be made true**:\n    The option claims a specific choice of $f$ and $g$ makes $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ true.\n    $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ under this interpretation is $\\forall x \\in D, \\forall z \\in D, g(x) = f(x)$.\n    The quantifiers for $z$ are vacuous here; the condition does not depend on $z$. The statement simplifies to $\\forall x \\in D, g(x) = f(x)$.\n    The problem asks if there is a way to interpret $g$ to make $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ true. Yes, for any given $f$, we can simply define $g$ to be the same function as $f$, i.e., $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in D$. With this choice, $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ becomes $\\forall x \\forall z (f(x)=f(x))$, which is true.\n    Since we can find an interpretation of $g$ that makes $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ true, this structure is not a countermodel of the required type. The predicate $R(x,y,z,w) \\iff w=y$ makes $w$ dependent on $y$, which becomes $f(x)$ after the first Skolemization step. So $w$ only needs to depend on $x$, and a unary function $g(x)$ is sufficient. The student's mistake has no consequence here.\n\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D. Domain $D=\\{0,1\\}$. Interpret $R$ so that $R(x,y,z,w)$ holds if and only if $w=0$.**\n\n1.  **Check if $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ can be made true**:\n    The option claims a specific choice of $f$ and $g$ makes $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ true.\n    $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ under this interpretation is $\\forall x \\in D, \\forall z \\in D, g(x) = 0$.\n    The quantifiers for $z$ are again vacuous. The statement simplifies to $\\forall x \\in D, g(x) = 0$.\n    Can we interpret $g$ to make this true? Yes. We can define $g$ as the constant function $g(x)=0$ for all $x \\in D$. With this choice, $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ is true.\n    Since we can find an interpretation of $g$ that makes $\\Phi_{\\text{wrong}}$ true, this is not the required countermodel. Here, the choice of $w$ is constant ($w=0$), so it depends on neither $x$ nor $z$. A Skolem constant would have sufficed. A unary function $g(x)$ is more than sufficient.\n\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A provides a structure that correctly serves as a countermodel to the student's invalid inference. It constructs a scenario where the value for $w$ must be equal to $z$, making it impossible for a function of just $x$ to satisfy the condition for all $z$ in a non-singleton domain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3053265"}]}
