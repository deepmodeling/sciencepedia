The specified calculus, rules, and the sequent for proof are standard. The sequent is a known tautology (a case of the transitivity of implication). The objective to find a minimal proof in terms of rule applications is a standard proof-theoretic question. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudo-scientific claims.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\nWe will now construct a proof of the sequent by working backward from the goal, applying the rules of LK. The objective is to find a proof that uses the minimum number of logical rule applications. A proof is a tree where each node is a sequent, the root is the sequent to be proven, and the leaves are initial axioms of the form $A \\vdash A$.\n\nThe sequent to be proven is:\n$$ \\vdash \\left(((P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)) \\land (R \\to S)\\right) \\to (P \\to S) $$\nThe main connective is $\\to$. The only rule that can be applied is the right introduction rule for implication ($\\to R$), which states $\\frac{\\Gamma, A \\vdash B, \\Delta}{\\Gamma \\vdash A \\to B, \\Delta}$.\nApplying this rule is our first logical rule application ($N=1$).\n$$ \\frac{((P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)) \\land (R \\to S) \\vdash P \\to S}{\\vdash \\left(((P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)) \\land (R \\to S)\\right) \\to (P \\to S)} (\\to R) $$\nThe new goal is the premise of this rule. The formula on the right side is $P \\to S$. We must apply the $\\to R$ rule again. This is our second logical rule application ($N=2$).\n$$ \\frac{P, ((P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)) \\land (R \\to S) \\vdash S}{((P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)) \\land (R \\to S) \\vdash P \\to S} (\\to R) $$\nThe sequent to prove is now $P, ((P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)) \\land (R \\to S) \\vdash S$. To proceed, we must decompose the complex formula on the left side (the antecedent). The main connective is a conjunction. We apply the left introduction rule for conjunction ($\\land L$), which is $\\frac{\\Gamma, A, B \\vdash \\Delta}{\\Gamma, A \\land B \\vdash \\Delta}$. This counts as our third logical rule application ($N=3$).\n$$ \\frac{P, (P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R), R \\to S \\vdash S}{P, ((P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)) \\land (R \\to S) \\vdash S} (\\land L) $$\nWe have another conjunction on the left, $(P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R)$. We apply the $\\land L$ rule again. This is our fourth logical rule application ($N=4$).\n$$ \\frac{P, P \\to Q, Q \\to R, R \\to S \\vdash S}{P, (P \\to Q) \\land (Q \\to R), R \\to S \\vdash S} (\\land L) $$\nThe current goal sequent is $P, P \\to Q, Q \\to R, R \\to S \\vdash S$. At this stage, the initial formula has been fully decomposed into a set of premises. To complete the proof, we must show that $S$ follows from these premises. This requires using the implications. We must apply the left introduction rule for implication ($\\to L$), which states $\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash A, \\Delta \\quad B, \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta}{\\Gamma, A \\to B \\vdash \\Delta}$. This rule splits the proof into two branches. To achieve a minimal proof, we must choose the order of applying this rule strategically.\n\nA highly efficient strategy is to simulate forward chaining, starting from the known atom $P$.\nWe have $P$ in our antecedent. We apply the $\\to L$ rule to the formula $P \\to Q$.

This is an initial axiom, as the formula $P$ appears on both the left and right sides. This branch of the proof is complete without further logical rules.\n- **Branch 2:** $Q, P, Q \\to R, R \\to S \\vdash S$. This sequent must now be proven. We now have $Q$ in our antecedent. We proceed by applying $\\to L$ to the next implication in the chain, $Q \\to R$. This is our sixth logical rule application ($N=6$).\n$$ \\frac{Q, P, R \\to S \\vdash Q, S \\quad (\\text{Branch 2a}) \\qquad R, Q, P, R \\to S \\vdash S \\quad (\\text{Branch 2b})}{Q, P, Q \\to R, R \\to S \\vdash S} (\\to L) $$\nAnalyzing the new sub-branches:\n- **Branch 2a:** $Q, P, R \\to S \\vdash Q, S$. This is an initial axiom, as $Q$ appears on both sides. This branch is complete.\n- **Branch 2b:** $R, Q, P, R \\to S \\vdash S$. This is our new goal. We have $R$ in the antecedent. The final step is to use the last implication, $R \\to S$. We apply the $\\to L$ rule. This is our seventh and final logical rule application ($N=7$).\n$$ \\frac{R, Q, P \\vdash R, S \\quad (\\text{Branch 2b-i}) \\qquad S, R, Q, P \\vdash S \\quad (\\text{Branch 2b-ii})}{R, Q, P, R \\to S \\vdash S} (\\to L) $$\nAnalyzing these last two branches:\n- **Branch 2b-i:** $R, Q, P \\vdash R, S$. This is an initial axiom because of $R$.\n- **Branch 2b-ii:** $S, R, Q, P \\vdash S$. This is an initial axiom because of $S$.\n\nAll branches of the proof terminate in initial axioms. The total number of logical rules applied is $7$.\n\nTo confirm this is the minimal number, we argue for the necessity of each step:\n1.  The two applications of $\\to R$ are unavoidable to break down the nested implication structure of the succedent.\n2.  The two applications of $\\land L$ are unavoidable to decompose the nested conjunction in the antecedent.\n3.  This brings us to the sequent $P, P \\to Q, Q \\to R, R \\to S \\vdash S$. To prove $S$ from the premise $P$, the proof must logically traverse the chain of implications $P \\to Q$, $Q \\to R$, and $R \\to S$. In cut-free LK, each such traversal step (equivalent to an application of Modus Ponens) is primarily accomplished via the $\\to L$ rule. Each of the three implications must be \"activated\" by one application of $\\to L$ to connect $P$ to $S$. Therefore, at least three applications of $\\to L$ are necessary.\n\nThe total minimum number of logical rule applications is the sum of these necessary steps: $2 (\\to R) + 2 (\\land L) + 3 (\\to L) = 7$.\nThe constructed proof achieves this lower bound. Thus, the minimal number of applications is $7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "id": "3052306"}, {"introduction": "Gentzen's Cut-Elimination Theorem is the cornerstone of sequent calculus, but its proof can seem abstract.

Express no units with your answer. Round nothing and present the exact value.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the maximal cut-rank of a sequent calculus derivation after performing a sequence of two specific cut-reduction steps.\n\nFirst, the given problem statement is validated. The problem is situated within the standard framework of first-order sequent calculus and proof theory. It provides clear, explicit, and self-contained definitions for the rank of a formula and describes a standard procedure for cut reduction. The question is formal, objective, and well-posed, asking for a specific value derived from the given initial conditions and rules. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientific inaccuracies. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by tracking the transformation of the cut-formula and calculating the ranks at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the initial state**\n\nThe initial derivation contains a single $\\mathsf{cut}$ on the formula $\\chi$:\n$$ \\chi = \\forall x\\,\\big(P(x) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R)\\big) $$\nThe cut-rank of this initial derivation is the rank of $\\chi$, denoted $|\\chi|$. We compute this rank using the provided recursive definition. The problem states that $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are atomic formulas. For any term $t$, the ranks of the atomic components are $|P(t)| = 1$, $|Q| = 1$, and $|R| = 1$.\n\nWe compute the rank of $\\chi$ from its subformulas upwards:\n- The rank of the negated formula $\\neg Q$ is $|\\neg Q| = 1 + |Q| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n- The rank of the disjunction $\\neg Q \\lor R$ is $|\\neg Q \\lor R| = 1 + |\\neg Q| + |R| = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n- The rank of the conjunction inside the quantifier, for any variable $x$, is $|P(x) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R)| = 1 + |P(x)| + |\\neg Q \\lor R| = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6$.\n- Finally, the rank of the initial cut-formula $\\chi$ is $|\\chi| = |\\forall x\\,\\big(P(x) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R)\\big)| = 1 + |P(x) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R)| = 1 + 6 = 7$.\n\nSo, the initial cut-rank of the derivation is $7$.\n\n**Step 2: First reduction step on the universal quantifier**\n\nThe first reduction step, as described, addresses the main connective of $\\chi$, which is the universal quantifier $\\forall x$. The standard cut-elimination procedure for a principal $\\forall$-cut replaces the cut on $\\forall x\\, A(x)$ with a cut on a specific instance $A(t)$, where $t$ is a term (in this case, described as a free variable). This strictly reduces the complexity of the cut-formula.\n\nThe cut on $\\chi = \\forall x\\,\\big(P(x) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R)\\big)$ is replaced by a new, single cut on the formula $\\chi_1$:\n$$ \\chi_1 = P(t) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R) $$\nThe rank of this new cut-formula is $|\\chi_1|$. Based on our earlier calculation, this is $|\\chi_1| = |P(t) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R)| = 6$. After this step, the derivation has one cut of rank $6$. The maximal cut-rank of the derivation is now $6$.\n\n**Step 3: Second reduction step on the conjunction**\n\nThe second reduction step addresses the main connective of the new cut-formula $\\chi_1$, which is the conjunction $\\land$. The problem specifies that this reduction splits the cut into \"two cuts on the conjuncts.\" This corresponds to the standard reduction step where a cut on a formula $A \\land B$ is replaced by a more complex derivation structure that involves one cut on formula $A$ and another cut on formula $B$.\n\nThe cut on $\\chi_1 = P(t) \\land (\\neg Q \\lor R)$ is thus eliminated and replaced by two new cuts. The formulas for these two cuts are the conjuncts of $\\chi_1$:\n- The first new cut-formula is $\\chi_2 = P(t)$.\n- The second new cut-formula is $\\chi_3 = \\neg Q \\lor R$.\n\n**Step 4: Computation of the final maximal cut-rank**\n\nThe final derivation no longer contains cuts on $\\chi$ or $\\chi_1$. Instead, it contains two cuts on $\\chi_2$ and $\\chi_3$. The cut-rank of this final derivation is the maximum of the ranks of all cut-formulas present within it. We must calculate the ranks of $\\chi_2$ and $\\chi_3$.\n- The rank of $\\chi_2 = P(t)$ is $|\\chi_2| = |P(t)| = 1$, since $P$ is an atomic formula.\n- The rank of $\\chi_3 = \\neg Q \\lor R$ is $|\\chi_3| = |\\neg Q \\lor R| = 4$, as calculated in Step 1.\n\nThe set of ranks of the cut-formulas in the resulting derivation is $\\{1, 4\\}$. The maximal cut-rank is the maximum value in this set.\n$$ \\text{Maximal cut-rank} = \\max(|\\chi_2|, |\\chi_3|) = \\max(1, 4) = 4 $$\nEach reduction step strictly reduced the rank of the formula being cut ($|\\chi_1| = 6 < |\\chi| = 7$, and $|\\chi_2| = 1 < |\\chi_1| = 6$, and $|\\chi_3| = 4 < |\\chi_1| = 6$), which is consistent with the cut-elimination theorem.
