By assuming a formula is false and working backward through the semantic rules, you can test for validity by searching for a contradiction, a core skill for any logician.

A valuation is a function $v$ from propositional variables to $\\{0,1\\}$, where $1$ denotes “true” and $0$ denotes “false.” The semantics for the connectives are defined by the fundamental truth conditions:\n- $v(\\lnot \\varphi) = 1$ if and only if $v(\\varphi) = 0$.\n- $v(\\varphi \\to \\psi) = 0$ if and only if $v(\\varphi) = 1$ and $v(\\psi) = 0$; otherwise $v(\\varphi \\to \\psi) = 1$.\nA formula $\\varphi$ is valid if $v(\\varphi) = 1$ for every valuation $v$.

Let us denote its antecedent and consequent as follows:\nLet $\\Psi = \\Big(\\,(p \\to q) \\to (\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p)\\,\\Big)\\;\\wedge\\;\\Big(\\,(q \\to r) \\to (\\lnot r \\to \\lnot q)\\,\\Big)$.\nLet $\\Omega = \\Big(\\,(p \\to r) \\to (\\lnot r \\to \\lnot p)\\,\\Big)$.\nThen, the formula is $\\Phi = \\Psi \\to \\Omega$.\n\nAccording to the provided semantic clause for implication, a formula of the form $\\alpha \\to \\beta$ is false if and only if the antecedent $\\alpha$ is true and the consequent $\\beta$ is false. Therefore, for a valuation $v$ to make $\\Phi$ false, it must satisfy $v(\\Phi) = 0$. This holds if and only if:\n$1$. $v(\\Psi) = 1$\n$2$. $v(\\Omega) = 0$\n\nWe will analyze the second condition, $v(\\Omega) = 0$, first. The formula $\\Omega$ is itself an implication:\n$$\n\\Omega = (p \\to r) \\to (\\lnot r \\to \\lnot p).\n$$\nFor $v(\\Omega) = 0$, its antecedent must be true and its consequent must be false. This gives us two sub-conditions that must hold simultaneously:\n2a. $v(p \\to r) = 1$\n2b. $v(\\lnot r \\to \\lnot p) = 0$\n\nLet's analyze condition (2b).

The value of $v(q)$ can be either $0$ or $1$.\n\nNow, we must check if these necessary assignments for $p$ and $r$ are consistent with condition (2a), which is $v(p \\to r) = 1$.\nLet's evaluate the truth value of $p \\to r$ under the valuation where $v(p) = 1$ and $v(r) = 0$.\nThe semantic clause for implication states that $v(\\varphi \\to \\psi) = 0$ if and only if $v(\\varphi) = 1$ and $v(\\psi) = 0$.\nWith $v(p) = 1$ and $v(r) = 0$, we find that $v(p \\to r) = 0$.\n\nThis result, $v(p \\to r) = 0$, directly contradicts condition (2a), which requires $v(p \\to r) = 1$.\nThe set of conditions needed to make $\\Omega$ false is $\\{ v(p \\to r) = 1, v(\\lnot r \\to \\lnot p) = 0 \\}$. We have shown that the second condition, $v(\\lnot r \\to \\lnot p) = 0$, implies $v(p) = 1$ and $v(r) = 0$, which in turn implies $v(p \\to r) = 0$. This is a logical contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to satisfy both conditions (2a) and (2b) simultaneously for any valuation $v$. This means there is no valuation $v$ for which $v(\\Omega) = 0$. In other words, the formula $\\Omega = (p \\to r) \\to (\\lnot r \\to \\lnot p)$ is a valid formula (a tautology), meaning $v(\\Omega)=1$ for all valuations $v$.\n\nReturning to the original goal of finding valuations that make $\\Phi$ false, we required two conditions to be met: $v(\\Psi) = 1$ and $v(\\Omega) = 0$.

The formula $\\Phi$ is itself a tautology, as its consequent $\\Omega$ is a tautology, which means the implication $\\Psi \\to \\Omega$ can never be falsified.\n\nThe number of valuations $v:\\{p,q,r\\}\\to\\{0,1\\}$ that make $\\Phi$ false is exactly $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3053740"}, {"introduction": "A sound proof system is a carefully constructed engine where every component—every axiom and rule of inference—is designed to preserve truth.

This is not an instance of any of the axiom schemata $A1, A2, A3$. Nor is it a theorem of $\\mathsf{H}$ (it is not a tautology).

Let's evaluate.\n    - Antecedent of the inferred formula: $v(p \\rightarrow q) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$.\n    - Since the antecedent of the main implication is false, the entire formula is true. $v((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (\\dots)) = v(0 \\rightarrow \\dots) = 1$.\n    The valuation makes the formula true, not false.

Let's evaluate.\n    - The subformula $(p \\rightarrow p)$ is a tautology; its value is always $1$ regardless of the valuation of $p$. Let's denote it by $T$. So $v(p \\rightarrow p)=1$.\n    - The inferred formula is $(q \\rightarrow T) \\rightarrow T$.\n    - The antecedent $(q \\rightarrow T)$ is also a tautology.

The first part is to explain, using semantic definitions, why a tableau closure based on a flawed existential instantiation is spurious. The second part is to determine the minimum cardinality of a domain for a structure that satisfies $\\Gamma$.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of the Spurious Tableau Closure\n\nThe soundness of a proof system, such as the analytic tableau method, is its most critical property. It guarantees that the system only proves true statements. For tableau, soundness means that if a tableau for a set of formulas $\\Gamma$ closes, then $\\Gamma$ is semantically unsatisfiable. This property relies on each tableau rule being satisfiability-preserving: if a set of formulas on a branch is satisfiable, then the set of formulas on the extended branch (or branches) after applying a rule is also satisfiable.\n\nThe standard existential instantiation rule states that if a branch contains a formula of the form $\\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$, one may add the formula $\\varphi(c)$ to the branch, where $c$ is a parameter symbol that is new to the branch. The violation described in the problem is to ignore this \"newness\" or \"freshness\" requirement.\n\nLet us analyze this violation in the context of the set $\\Gamma=\\{\\exists x\\,P(x),\\ \\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)\\}$.\nThe semantic definition of satisfaction for an existential formula in a structure $\\mathcal{M} = (D, I)$, where $D$ is the domain and $I$ is the interpretation function, is as follows:\n$\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$ if and only if there exists at least one element $d \\in D$ such that the formula $\\varphi(x)$ is satisfied in $\\mathcal{M}$ under a variable assignment that maps $x$ to $d$. We denote this as $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi(d)$.\n\nApplying this to the formulas in $\\Gamma$:\n1.  For a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ to satisfy $\\exists x\\,P(x)$, written $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,P(x)$, there must exist some element, let's call it $d_1$, in the domain $D$ such that $d_1$ is in the interpretation of $P$. That is, $d_1 \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n2.  For $\\mathcal{M}$ to satisfy $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$, written $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$, there must exist some element, let's call it $d_2$, in the domain $D$ such that $d_2$ is not in the interpretation of $P$. That is, $d_2 \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nThe crucial point is that the semantic definitions do not impose any relationship between $d_1$ and $d_2$. In particular, they do not require that $d_1 = d_2$. The set $\\Gamma$ is satisfiable if we can find a domain $D$ and an interpretation $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ such that there is at least one element in $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ and at least one element not in $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nThe careless tableau construction instantiates both $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ and $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$ using the same, non-fresh parameter $a$. This adds $P(a)$ and $\\neg P(a)$ to the same branch. A branch containing a formula and its negation, $P(a)$ and $\\neg P(a)$, is contradictory and must be closed.\nThis closure is spurious because the rule application was unsound. By using the same parameter $a$ for both instantiations, the tableau is no longer searching for any model of $\\Gamma$. Instead, it is searching for a model of a much stronger, implicitly derived formula: $\\exists x\\,(P(x) \\land \\neg P(x))$. This formula asserts the existence of a single element that both has and does not have the property $P$. Such a formula is a logical falsehood and is unsatisfiable in any FOL structure. The flawed tableau rule transforms the satisfiable set $\\Gamma$ into an unsatisfiable statement. The closure of the tableau correctly indicates that $\\exists x\\,(P(x) \\land \\neg P(x))$ is unsatisfiable, but it incorrectly attributes this unsatisfiability to the original set $\\Gamma$. The mistake lies in the inferential step, which does not preserve satisfiability and is therefore unsound.\n\nPart 2: Minimum Cardinality of a Satisfying Model\n\nWe seek the minimum possible cardinality, $n = |D|$, of the domain $D$ of a structure $\\mathcal{M}=(D, P^{\\mathcal{M}})$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$.\nAs established, for $\\mathcal{M}$ to be a model of $\\Gamma$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$, which means $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n2.  $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$ is true in $\\mathcal M$, which means $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\neq D$, or equivalently, $D \\setminus P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet's test possible values for $n$, starting from the smallest allowed cardinality for a domain in standard FOL, which is $1$.\n\nCase $n=1$: Let the domain be $D = \\{d_0\\}$. The interpretation of $P$, $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, must be a subset of $D$. There are two possibilities for $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$:\n-   If we set $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\emptyset$, then the formula $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is false, because there is no element in $D$ that is a member of $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. So, this structure is not a model of $\\Gamma$.\n-   If we set $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{d_0\\}$, then $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = D$. The formula $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$ is false, because there is no element in $D$ that is not a member of $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. So, this structure is not a model of $\\Gamma$.\nIn either case, it is impossible to satisfy both formulas in $\\Gamma$ with a domain of cardinality $1$. Therefore, the minimum cardinality must be $n > 1$.\n\nCase $n=2$: Let the domain be $D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$. We need to find an interpretation $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\subseteq D$ that satisfies both conditions.\nLet's define $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{d_1\\}$. Now we check if this structure $\\mathcal{M}=(D, P^{\\mathcal{M}})$ is a model for $\\Gamma$:\n-   Check $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,P(x)$: The element $d_1$ exists in $D$ and $d_1 \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. Thus, the formula is satisfied.\n-   Check $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$: The element $d_2$ exists in $D$ and $d_2 \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. Thus, the formula is satisfied.\nSince both formulas in $\\Gamma$ are satisfied, we have successfully constructed a model with a domain of cardinality $2$.\n\nSince a model of cardinality $1$ is impossible ($n>1$) and a model of cardinality $2$ exists ($n \\le 2$), the minimum possible cardinality of the domain is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3053739"}]}
