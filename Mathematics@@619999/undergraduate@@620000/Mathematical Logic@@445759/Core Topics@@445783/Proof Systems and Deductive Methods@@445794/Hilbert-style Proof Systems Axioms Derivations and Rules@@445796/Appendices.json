It is a standard problem in introductory proof theory within mathematical logic. It is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It requests a conceptual explanation based on formal definitions and a concrete verification via truth-functional semantics, both of which are standard, verifiable procedures. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nA standard Hilbert-style (HS) propositional proof system is a formal system defined by a set of axiom schemata and, typically, a single rule of inference: Modus Ponens (MP). A derivation is a finite sequence of well-formed formulas, $\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\dots, \\phi_n$, where each $\\phi_i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) is either an instance of an axiom schema or is derived from two preceding formulas $\\phi_j$ and $\\phi_k$ (where $j, k  i$) such that $\\phi_k$ has the form $\\phi_j \\to \\phi_i$.\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of the role of the axiom schema $A \\to (B \\to A)$ and a semantic verification of a specific instance.\n\nFirst, we address the conceptual role of the schema $A \\to (B \\to A)$. This schema is often called the axiom of weakening or thinning. It provides a purely syntactic mechanism to achieve a result that, in other proof systems like Natural Deduction, is handled by a rule for introducing assumptions. In a Natural Deduction system, to prove a formula $B \\to A$, one can temporarily assume $B$, proceed to derive $A$, and then \"discharge\" the assumption $B$ to conclude $B \\to A$.\n\nHilbert-style systems do not possess such a mechanism for managing assumptions and their discharge. The proof structure is linear and strictly forward-chaining. The axiom $A \\to (B \\to A)$ compensates for this by encoding a logical principle directly into the syntax. It syntactically expresses the semantic truth that if a proposition $A$ is true, then it is implied by any other proposition $B$.\n\nThe problem asks to demonstrate how, given a derivation of $A$, one can obtain a derivation of $B \\to A$. A derivation of $A$ means that $A$ appears as the final line in a valid proof sequence. Let us assume we have such a proof for $A$. We can then extend this proof to derive $B \\to A$ for any formula $B$ in two additional steps:\n\n1.  $A$ (This line exists by the hypothesis that a derivation of $A$ is given.)\n2.  $A \\to (B \\to A)$ (This is a direct application of the axiom schema, where $A$ is the formula from line $1$ and $B$ is any arbitrary well-formed formula.)\n3.  $B \\to A$ (This line follows from lines $1$ and $2$ by the rule of Modus Ponens.)\n\nThis three-line sequence (or two-line extension to an existing proof of $A$) demonstrates how the axiom schema $A \\to (B \\to A)$ functions as a \"syntactic surrogate\" for assumption introduction. Without needing to assume $B$, the axiom allows us to prepend `$B \\to$` to any established theorem $A$. It effectively \"weakens\" the established truth $A$ by adding an irrelevant premise $B$.\n\nNext, we verify the semantic validity of the specific instance where $A$ is the formula $(P \\land R)$ and $B$ is the formula $(Q \\lor R)$. The resulting formula, let's call it $\\Phi$, is:\n$$ \\Phi \\equiv (P \\land R) \\to \\big((Q \\lor R) \\to (P \\land R)\\big) $$\nThis formula is an instance of the general schema $X \\to (Y \\to X)$, where $X \\equiv (P \\land R)$ and $Y \\equiv (Q \\lor R)$. A formula of the form $X \\to (Y \\to X)$ is a tautology in classical propositional logic. We can demonstrate this without constructing the full truth table first. For the implication $\\Phi$ to be false, its antecedent must be true and its consequent must be false.\n1.  $X$ must be true.\n2.  $Y \\to X$ must be false.\n\nFor the second condition, $Y \\to X$, to be false, its own antecedent must be true and its consequent must be false.\n2.a. $Y$ must be true.\n2.b. $X$ must be false.\n\nThis leads to a direct contradiction: condition $1$ requires $X$ to be true, while condition $2.b$ requires $X$ to be false. It is impossible for both to hold. Therefore, a formula of the structure $X \\to (Y \\to X)$ can never be false. It is a tautology.\n\nAs a tautology, the formula must be true for all possible truth valuations of its propositional variables. The variables are $P, Q, R$, so there are $2^3 = 8$ possible valuations. The formula must evaluate to true for all of them.\n\nTo be fully rigorous as requested, we construct the truth table for all $8$ valuations.

We will derive $A \\to A$ in this system, guided by the idea behind the natural deduction proof: assume $A$ and conclude $A$, then introduce $\\to$ to obtain $A \\to A$. In Hilbert systems, assumption and $\\to$-introduction are not rules; instead, the axioms $H1$ and $H2$ mediate the corresponding reasoning.\n\nFirst, we outline the mapping from the natural deduction steps to Hilbert axiom uses:\n- The natural deduction \"assumption\" of $A$ and the fact that from $A$ one can infer any weakening such as $\\psi \\to A$ are captured by axiom $H1$, which states $\\varphi \\to (\\psi \\to \\varphi)$. Instantiating $H1$ with $\\varphi := A$ and an arbitrary $\\psi$ yields $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$, expressing that if $A$ holds, then under any extra condition $\\psi$ we can still obtain $A$.\n- The natural deduction $\\to$-introduction, which internalizes a derivation from an assumption $A$ to a conclusion $\\chi$ as $A \\to \\chi$, is captured by axiom $H2$. Axiom $H2$ says $(\\varphi \\to (\\psi \\to \\chi)) \\to ((\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\varphi \\to \\chi))$. This internalizes a conditional proof: if from $\\varphi$ we can get $\\psi \\to \\chi$, and also from $\\varphi$ we can get $\\psi$, then from $\\varphi$ we can get $\\chi$. Setting $\\chi := A$ will yield $A \\to A$.\n\nWe now construct a concrete Hilbert derivation of $A \\to A$ using only $H1$, $H2$, and MP. Let $B$ be an arbitrary formula. Consider the following sequence:\n\n1. From $H1$ with $\\varphi := A$ and $\\psi := B$, we have\n   $$A \\to (B \\to A).$$\n\n2. From $H1$ with $\\varphi := A$ and $\\psi := (B \\to A)$, we have\n   $$A \\to ((B \\to A) \\to A).$$\n\n3. From $H2$ with $\\varphi := A$, $\\psi := (B \\to A)$, and $\\chi := A$, we have\n   $$(A \\to ((B \\to A) \\to A)) \\to ((A \\to (B \\to A)) \\to (A \\to A)).$$\n\n4. By MP applied to line $2$ and line $3$, we obtain\n   $$(A \\to (B \\to A)) \\to (A \\to A).$$\n\n5. By MP applied to line $1$ and line $4$, we obtain\n   $$A \\to A.$$\n\nThis derivation concludes $A \\to A$ using two instances of $H1$, one instance of $H2$, and two applications of MP.\n\nWe now compute the derivation cost $C$. By definition, $C$ counts all lines that are either axiom instances ($H1$ or $H2$) or obtained by a single application of MP. In the derivation above, the counted lines are:\n- Line $1$ ($H1$ instance),\n- Line $2$ ($H1$ instance),\n- Line $3$ ($H2$ instance),\n- Line $4$ (MP),\n- Line $5$ (MP).\n\nTherefore, for this derivation, $C = 5$.\n\nTo show minimality, we argue that no shorter derivation is possible under the given constraints:\n- Axiom $H1$ alone cannot produce $A \\to A$, because every instance of $H1$ has the form $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$, which retains an extra antecedent $\\psi$ and thus cannot conclude $A \\to A$ without an application of $H2$ to eliminate $\\psi$.\n- The only way to obtain a formula whose consequent is $A \\to A$ from the axioms is to use an instance of $H2$ with $\\chi := A$, namely $(A \\to (\\psi \\to A)) \\to ((A \\to \\psi) \\to (A \\to A))$ for some $\\psi$. This requires providing both $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$ and $A \\to \\psi$ as premises and then performing two applications of MP to reach $A \\to A$.\n- Supplying $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$ and $A \\to \\psi$ minimally uses two instances of $H1$: one with $\\psi$ as chosen and one with $\\psi := (B \\to A)$ or any suitable $\\psi$ that makes the $H2$ instance work. Thus, at least three axiom instances (two from $H1$, one from $H2$) and two MP steps are necessary, totaling $5$ lines.\n\nHence, the minimal derivation cost is $C = 5$.\n\nThis derivation also clarifies the translation and mapping: the natural deduction \"assumption\" step corresponds to instantiations of $H1$ that encode the availability of $A$ under additional conditions, and the natural deduction $\\to$-introduction corresponds to using $H2$ to internalize the conditional proof, eliminating auxiliary antecedents and producing $A \\to A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3044431"}, {"introduction": "Moving from propositional to first-order logic introduces the complexity of quantifiers.

Formally, the side condition is that the term $t$ be free for the variable $x$ in the formula $A$, meaning that no free occurrence of a variable in $t$ becomes bound when $t$ replaces $x$ in $A$.

Unsoundness means there exists a structure (a model) $\\mathcal{M}$ in which the premise $\\forall x\\, A(x)$ is true, but the conclusion $A(t/x)$ is false. This unsoundness must arise from a violation of the \"free-for\" condition, leading to variable capture.\n\nLet's construct such a case from first principles.\n1.  **Violate the \"free for\" condition:** We need a formula $A(x)$, a term $t$, and a variable $z$ such that:\n    *   $z$ occurs free in $t$.\n    *   A free occurrence of $x$ in $A(x)$ is within the scope of a quantifier on $z$ (e.g., $\\exists z$ or $\\forall z$).\n    A canonical choice is $A(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\, P(x, y)$ and $t \\equiv y$. Here, the variable $z$ from the general rule is $y$. The term $t$ is the variable $y$ itself, which is trivially free in $t$. The formula $A(x)$ has a free occurrence of $x$ inside the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$. Thus, $t$ is *not* free for $x$ in $A(x)$.\n\n2.  **Perform the naive substitution:** According to the problem's definition, $A(t/x)$ or $A(y/x)$ is formed by replacing the free $x$ in $\\exists y\\, P(x, y)$ with $y$. This results in the formula $\\exists y\\, P(y, y)$. The substituted $y$ has been \"captured\" by the existential quantifier.\n\n3.  **Demonstrate unsoundness:** The inference to check is $\\forall x\\, (\\exists y\\, P(x, y)) \\vdash \\exists y\\, P(y, y)$. To show this is unsound, we need a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ where the premise is true and the conclusion is false.\n    *   **Premise:** $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\, \\exists y\\, P(x, y)$. This means for every element $a$ in the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$, there exists some element $b$ such that the relation $P(a, b)$ holds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\exists y\\, P(y, y)$. This is equivalent to $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall y\\, \\neg P(y, y)$, meaning for every element $c$ in the domain, the relation $P(c, c)$ does not hold.\n\n4.  **Construct the structure $\\mathcal{M}$:** Let the domain be a simple set, for example, $D = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    *   To satisfy $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\exists y\\, P(y, y)$, we must define the interpretation of $P$, denoted $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, such that $(0,0) \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ and $(1,1) \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n    *   To satisfy $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\, \\exists y\\, P(x, y)$:\n        *   For $x=0$, we need a $y \\in D$ such that $(0, y) \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. Since $(0,0) \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, we must have $(0, 1) \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n        *   For $x=1$, we need a $y \\in D$ such that $(1, y) \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. Since $(1,1) \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, we must have $(1, 0) \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n    *   This uniquely determines the relation $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ on $D$: $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{(0,1), (1,0)\\}$. This relation can be described as $a \\ne b$, or, for the domain $\\{0, 1\\}$, as $b = 1 - a$.\n\nThis construction provides the three required elements: the formulas, the counter-model, and the justification based on the \"free for\" condition.

For $x=0$, we need $\\exists y (y=1-0)$, i.e., $y=1$. $1$ is in the domain. For $x=1$, we need $\\exists y (y=1-1)$, i.e., $y=0$. $0$ is in the domain. The premise is true.\n    *   Conclusion check: The substituted formula $A(y/x)$ is $\\exists y\\, P(y,y)$. The claim is $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\exists y\\, P(y,y)$. This means $\\forall y\\, \\neg P(y,y)$. For $y=0$, we check if $P(0,0)$ is false. $0=1-0$ is false. For $y=1$, we check if $P(1,1)$ is false. $1=1-1$ is false.

It follows directly that $P^{\\mathcal{M}}(c,c)$ must be true for all $c$ in the domain, which means the conclusion $\\forall y\\, P(y,y)$ is true. The inference is sound. The claim that it witnesses unsoundness is false. Furthermore, the claim that this holds \"using any structure\" is incorrect; one could easily construct a structure where the premise is false.\n*   The asserted side condition \"$x$ is not free in $A$\" is incorrect. It is neither the standard \"free for\" condition, nor is it a correct general principle.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The primary claim of unsoundness is false.\n\n**C. Let $A(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\, P(x,y)$ and $t \\equiv f(y)$ for a unary function symbol $f$. Take a structure with domain $\\mathbb{N}$, interpret $P^\\mathcal{M}(a,b)$ as $a = b$, and $f^\\mathcal{M}(n) = n$. It is claimed that no capture occurs because $t$ is a term, and the side condition is asserted to be: $t$ must be ground (contain no variables).**\n\n*   The substitution of $t \\equiv f(y)$ into $A(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\, P(x,y)$ is $A(f(y)/x) \\equiv \\exists y\\, P(f(y), y)$. The variable $y$ in the term $f(y)$ is captured by the quantifier $\\exists y$. The claim that \"no capture occurs\" is false.\n*   The option fails to demonstrate unsoundness. In the given structure, the premise $\\forall x\\, \\exists y\\, (x=y)$ is true over $\\mathbb{N}$. The conclusion $\\exists y\\, (f(y)=y)$, which interprets to $\\exists y\\, (y=y)$, is also true. A true premise leading to a true conclusion does not demonstrate unsoundness.\n*   The asserted side condition \"$t$ must be ground\" is sufficient to prevent capture, but it is overly restrictive. The correct condition is the more general \"free for\" rule. For instance, if $A(x) \\equiv Q(x, z)$, substituting $t \\equiv f(y)$ gives $Q(f(y), z)$, which is a perfectly valid substitution with a non-ground term. The problem asks for the *precise* articulation, which this is not.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It makes a false claim about variable capture, fails to demonstrate unsoundness, and provides an imprecise side condition.\n\n**D. Let $A(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\, P(y,x)$ and $t \\equiv y$. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ have domain $\\{0,1\\}$ and interpret $P^\\mathcal{M}(a,b)$ as $b = 1 - a$. It is claimed that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\, \\exists y\\, P(y,x)$ while $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists y\\, P(y,y)$, and that capture can always be avoided by renaming bound variables after substitution, so no side condition is required.**\n\n*   Substitution and Capture: The formula is $A(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\, P(y,x)$, and the term is $t \\equiv y$. The free variable in $t$ is $y$. The free occurrence of $x$ in $A(x)$ is inside the scope of the quantifier $\\exists y$. Therefore, the substitution is not \"free for\" and variable capture is a risk.\n*   Model Analysis:\n    *   Premise check: $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\, \\exists y\\, P(y,x)$ translates to $\\forall x \\in \\{0,1\\}, \\exists y \\in \\{0,1\\}, x = 1-y$. For $x=0$, we need $0=1-y$, so $y=1$, which exists. For $x=1$, we need $1=1-y$, so $y=0$, which exists. The premise is true.\n    *   Conclusion check: The substitution $A(y/x)$ yields $\\exists y\\, P(y,y)$. The option claims $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists y\\, P(y,y)$. This translates to $\\exists y \\in \\{0,1\\}, y=1-y$. For $y=0$, we get $0=1$, false. For $y=1$, we get $1=0$, false. Thus, the conclusion $\\exists y\\, P(y,y)$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$. The option makes a factually incorrect claim about the truth value of the conclusion in the given model.\n*   Side Condition Claim: The option claims \"no side condition is required\" because one can rename variables. This fundamentally misunderstands the role of the side condition. The side condition is the formal trigger that tells us *when* renaming is necessary *before* substitution. To claim it's not required is to reject the very principle being examined.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It misstates the truth value of the conclusion in the model and incorrectly dismisses the necessity of the side condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3044419"}]}
