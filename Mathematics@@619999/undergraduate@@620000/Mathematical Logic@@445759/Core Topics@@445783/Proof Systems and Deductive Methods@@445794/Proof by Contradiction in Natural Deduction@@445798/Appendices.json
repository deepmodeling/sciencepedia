Negation introduction ($\\lnot I$) is the rule that, from a sub-derivation of $\\bot$ from an assumption $\\phi$, allows the inference of $\\lnot \\phi$. This is intuitionistically valid.

This is a known non-theorem of intuitionistic logic. While it is provable in classical logic, its proof requires a non-intuitionistic rule. Let's demonstrate that an attempt to prove it intuitionistically leads to $\\lnot \\lnot \\varphi$, but not $\\varphi$.

In classical logic, $\\lnot(\\varphi \\to \\psi)$ is equivalent to $\\varphi \\land \\lnot \\psi$.\n\nVerdict for C: **Correct**.\n\n**D. From the single premise $\\lnot \\lnot (\\varphi \\lor \\psi)$, one can derive $\\varphi \\lor \\psi$ without using Proof by Contradiction.**\n\nThis claim states that $\\lnot \\lnot (\\varphi \\lor \\psi) \\vdash \\varphi \\lor \\psi$ is provable intuitionistically. This is an instance of the schema $\\lnot \\lnot \\chi \\vdash \\chi$, where $\\chi$ is the proposition $\\varphi \\lor \\psi$. This inference is the rule of Double Negation Elimination (DNE). DNE is not a valid rule in intuitionistic logic and is equivalent to PBC and the Law of the Excluded Middle. In general, DNE only holds intuitionistically for certain classes of \"stable\" propositions (e.g., negated formulas), but a disjunction like $\\varphi \\lor \\psi$ is not stable in general. The inability to prove $\\lnot \\lnot \\chi \\to \\chi$ for a disjunctive $\\chi$ is a canonical example of where intuitionistic and classical logic diverge.\n\nTherefore, one cannot derive $\\varphi \\lor \\psi$ from $\\lnot \\lnot (\\varphi \\lor \\psi)$ without using PBC or an equivalent classical principle.\n\nVerdict for D: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3049790"}, {"introduction": "Having explored *when* proof by contradiction is necessary, we now turn to *how* it is constructed.

Correct.** This option perfectly describes the steps of the valid proof shown above. It starts by assuming $\\lnot p$ for an outer proof by contradiction. To use the premise $((p \\to q) \\to p)$, it needs to derive the antecedent, $p \\to q$. This is done via a nested subproof (conditional proof) that assumes $p$, immediately finds a contradiction with the outer $\\lnot p$ assumption, uses explosion ($\\bot E$) to derive $q$, and then discharges the assumption $p$ to conclude $p \\to q$. Applying the premise with this derived antecedent yields $p$, which contradicts the initial $\\lnot p$ assumption, leading to $\\bot$. Finally, PBC is used to discharge $\\lnot p$ and conclude $p$.\n\n*   **B. Incorrect.** This template is nonsensical. It suggests using $\\lnot I$ on an assumption $p$ to conclude $\\lnot p$. The $\\lnot I$ rule allows concluding $\\lnot \\varphi$ after assuming $\\varphi$ and deriving $\\bot$; it does not allow inferring $\\lnot p$ directly from `p`. This option fundamentally misunderstands the negation introduction rule.\n\n*   **C. Incorrect.** This option describes an impossible sequence of rule applications. You cannot use $\\to E$ on $((p \\to q) \\to p)$ with $\\lnot p$, as $\\lnot p$ is not its antecedent $(p \\to q)$. The template is also confused about the rules of discharge, suggesting closing a subproof with $\\lnot I$ to get $\\lnot\\lnot p$. The entire proposed path is invalid.\n\n*   **D. Incorrect.** This template contains several errors. It claims one can infer $p \\to q$ from $\\lnot p$ \"without any inner sub-derivation\". This is false; the $\\to I$ rule requires a sub-derivation where the antecedent is assumed. While it is true that from $\\lnot p$ one can prove $p \\to q$ (because assuming $p$ leads to a contradiction, and anything follows from a contradiction via $\\bot E$), this still requires the formal sub-derivation structure described in option A.

If a subderivation assumes $\\lnot \\varphi$ and derives $\\bot$ using only the open premises $\\Gamma$ together with an undischarged temporary assumption $\\psi$, then applying RAA yields $\\varphi$ that depends on $\\Gamma$ and $\\psi$; only the assumption $\\lnot \\varphi$ is discharged.**\n\nLet us formalize the situation. We have a set of premises $\\Gamma$ and an open assumption $\\psi$. To prove $\\varphi$, we begin an RAA subderivation.\nLet the set of currently open assumptions be $\\Delta = \\Gamma \\cup \\{\\psi\\}$.\n1. We start a subderivation by assuming $\\lnot \\varphi$. The set of open assumptions within this subderivation is $\\Delta \\cup \\{\\lnot \\varphi\\}$.\n2. Within this scope, we derive $\\bot$. The derivation of $\\bot$ is sound, so it correctly depends on the available open assumptions: a proof for $\\Gamma, \\psi, \\lnot \\varphi \\vdash \\bot$.\n3. We apply the RAA rule. This rule allows us to conclude $\\varphi$ and specifically discharges the assumption $\\lnot \\varphi$ that initiated this subderivation.\n4. The resulting formula, $\\varphi$, inherits all other open assumptions. The set of assumptions on which $\\varphi$ depends is $(\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\psi\\} \\cup \\{\\lnot \\varphi\\}) \\setminus \\{\\lnot \\varphi\\} = \\Gamma \\cup \\{\\psi\\}$.\n\nThe statement accurately describes this process: $\\varphi$ depends on $\\Gamma$ and $\\psi$, and the RAA rule has discharged only the assumption $\\lnot \\varphi$. The assumption $\\psi$ remains open.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. When aiming to apply RAA to discharge $\\lnot \\varphi$, it is permissible for the derivation of $\\bot$ to depend on an assumption $\\chi$ introduced solely within a single branch of a disjunction elimination on $P \\lor Q$; the inferred $\\varphi$ will not depend on $\\chi$.**\n\nLet us analyze the structure of the proposed proof. We have an outer RAA subderivation assuming $\\lnot \\varphi$. Inside it, we perform a disjunction elimination ($\\lor E$) on a formula $P \\lor Q$.\nThe rule for $\\lor E$ is: from $P \\lor Q$, a derivation of $R$ from assumption $P$, and a derivation of $R$ from assumption $Q$, we can conclude $R$. The conclusion $R$ depends on the assumptions of $P \\lor Q$, plus any assumptions (other than $P$ and $Q$) used in the sub-derivations.\nThe statement says an assumption $\\chi$ is introduced *solely within a single branch*, say the $P$ branch. So we have a derivation of $\\bot$ from $P$ and $\\chi$. For $\\lor E$ to be applicable to conclude $\\bot$, we must also have a derivation of $\\bot$ from $Q$. The conclusion of the $\\lor E$ rule, $\\bot$, cannot depend on $\\chi$, because the scope of the assumption $\\chi$ is limited to the $P$ branch. Once that branch is closed to complete the $\\lor E$ proof, $\\chi$ is no longer an active assumption. Any formula concluded by the $\\lor E$ rule cannot depend on assumptions local to its branches. Thus, the setup described (\"permissible for the derivation of $\\bot$ to depend on... $\\chi$\") is incoherent if \"the derivation of $\\bot$\" refers to the $\\bot$ that results from the $\\lor E$ rule. The $\\lor E$ rule itself \"contains\" such local assumptions. While it is true that the finally inferred $\\varphi$ will not depend on $\\chi$, the premise of the statement describes a procedure that violates the formal conditions of the $\\lor E$ rule, which requires the same conclusion $R$ to be provable from $P$ and from $Q$ using the same background assumptions. Adding an exclusive assumption $\\chi$ in one branch means we are proving $\\Gamma, P, \\chi \\vdash \\bot$, not $\\Gamma, P \\vdash \\bot$ as required.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If $\\bot$ was derived under an assumption $\\chi$ that occurs only within a branch of a disjunction elimination on $P \\lor Q$, then one may infer $\\varphi$ by RAA outside that branch and freely use $\\varphi$ outside the disjunction elimination.**\n\nThis statement describes a severe violation of scope rules. Let's assume $\\bot$ is derived inside the $P$-branch of a $\\lor E$ proof, and this derivation depends on a local assumption $\\chi$.\n```\n  | [P]          (Assumption for ∨E)\n  |   [χ]        (Local Assumption)\n  |   ...\n  |   ⊥          (Depends on P, χ, and other open assumptions)\n```\nAt this point, $\\bot$ is only valid within the scope of both $P$ and $\\chi$. One cannot use this $\\bot$ \"outside that branch\". To do so would mean citing a line from a closed subderivation, which is a fundamental error. If one were to illegitimately apply RAA \"outside that branch\" based on this $\\bot$, the resulting $\\varphi$ would be invalidly derived. Using such a $\\varphi$ \"freely\" would propagate the error. The rules of natural deduction are designed precisely to prevent such invalid moves.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If the derivation of $\\bot$ relies on an assumption whose subderivation has already been closed (i.e., the assumption has been discharged and is out of scope at the point where $\\bot$ is claimed), then that $\\bot$ cannot legitimately support an application of RAA.**\n\nThis statement describes a classic pitfall in constructing proofs. A valid derivation for a formula on a given line can only reference premises and formulas from preceding lines that are \"visible\" from the current line's scope. If a subderivation for an assumption $\\psi$ has been closed, any formulas inside that subderivation (which depend on $\\psi$) are no longer accessible. A subsequent derivation of $\\bot$ cannot \"rely on\" the assumption $\\psi$ because $\\psi$ has been discharged, nor can it reference lines that were inside $\\psi$'s scope.\nTherefore, if a student constructs a proof where the derivation of $\\bot$ makes such an illicit reference, the derivation of $\\bot$ is invalid. An invalidly derived formula cannot be the basis for any legitimate subsequent inference. Consequently, this $\\bot$ \"cannot legitimately support an application of RAA.\" The statement correctly identifies an erroneous proof construction and its consequence.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. RAA discharges exactly one assumption: the most recently introduced assumption in the current open subderivation, regardless of which assumption the contradiction $\\bot$ was meant to target.**\n\nThis misrepresents the RAA rule. The application of RAA, written as `RAA, i-j` where line `i` is the assumption and line `j` is the conclusion $\\bot$, is specifically tied to the assumption at line `i`. The rule is: if assuming $\\lnot \\varphi$ allows the derivation of $\\bot$, then you may conclude $\\varphi$, discharging *that specific assumption* of $\\lnot \\varphi$. It is not a generic rule that discharges the most recent assumption. For example, one could have the following structure:\n```\n1.

The assumption $\\psi$ from line 2, which is more recent, is not discharged by this application of RAA and remains an open assumption upon which $\\varphi$ depends. The statement provides a false account of the rule's mechanism.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3049792"}]}
