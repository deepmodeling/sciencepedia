We will derive $A \\to A$ in this system, guided by the idea behind the natural deduction proof: assume $A$ and conclude $A$, then introduce $\\to$ to obtain $A \\to A$. In Hilbert systems, assumption and $\\to$-introduction are not rules; instead, the axioms $H1$ and $H2$ mediate the corresponding reasoning.\n\nFirst, we outline the mapping from the natural deduction steps to Hilbert axiom uses:\n- The natural deduction \"assumption\" of $A$ and the fact that from $A$ one can infer any weakening such as $\\psi \\to A$ are captured by axiom $H1$, which states $\\varphi \\to (\\psi \\to \\varphi)$. Instantiating $H1$ with $\\varphi := A$ and an arbitrary $\\psi$ yields $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$, expressing that if $A$ holds, then under any extra condition $\\psi$ we can still obtain $A$.\n- The natural deduction $\\to$-introduction, which internalizes a derivation from an assumption $A$ to a conclusion $\\chi$ as $A \\to \\chi$, is captured by axiom $H2$. Axiom $H2$ says $(\\varphi \\to (\\psi \\to \\chi)) \\to ((\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\varphi \\to \\chi))$. This internalizes a conditional proof: if from $\\varphi$ we can get $\\psi \\to \\chi$, and also from $\\varphi$ we can get $\\psi$, then from $\\varphi$ we can get $\\chi$. Setting $\\chi := A$ will yield $A \\to A$.\n\nWe now construct a concrete Hilbert derivation of $A \\to A$ using only $H1$, $H2$, and MP. Let $B$ be an arbitrary formula. Consider the following sequence:\n\n1. From $H1$ with $\\varphi := A$ and $\\psi := B$, we have\n   $$A \\to (B \\to A).$$\n\n2. From $H1$ with $\\varphi := A$ and $\\psi := (B \\to A)$, we have\n   $$A \\to ((B \\to A) \\to A).$$\n\n3. From $H2$ with $\\varphi := A$, $\\psi := (B \\to A)$, and $\\chi := A$, we have\n   $$(A \\to ((B \\to A) \\to A)) \\to ((A \\to (B \\to A)) \\to (A \\to A)).$$\n\n4. By MP applied to line $2$ and line $3$, we obtain\n   $$(A \\to (B \\to A)) \\to (A \\to A).$$\n\n5. By MP applied to line $1$ and line $4$, we obtain\n   $$A \\to A.$$\n\nThis derivation concludes $A \\to A$ using two instances of $H1$, one instance of $H2$, and two applications of MP.\n\nWe now compute the derivation cost $C$. By definition, $C$ counts all lines that are either axiom instances ($H1$ or $H2$) or obtained by a single application of MP. In the derivation above, the counted lines are:\n- Line $1$ ($H1$ instance),\n- Line $2$ ($H1$ instance),\n- Line $3$ ($H2$ instance),\n- Line $4$ (MP),\n- Line $5$ (MP).\n\nTherefore, for this derivation, $C = 5$.\n\nTo show minimality, we argue that no shorter derivation is possible under the given constraints:\n- Axiom $H1$ alone cannot produce $A \\to A$, because every instance of $H1$ has the form $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$, which retains an extra antecedent $\\psi$ and thus cannot conclude $A \\to A$ without an application of $H2$ to eliminate $\\psi$.\n- The only way to obtain a formula whose consequent is $A \\to A$ from the axioms is to use an instance of $H2$ with $\\chi := A$, namely $(A \\to (\\psi \\to A)) \\to ((A \\to \\psi) \\to (A \\to A))$ for some $\\psi$. This requires providing both $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$ and $A \\to \\psi$ as premises and then performing two applications of MP to reach $A \\to A$.\n- Supplying $A \\to (\\psi \\to A)$ and $A \\to \\psi$ minimally uses two instances of $H1$: one with $\\psi$ as chosen and one with $\\psi := (B \\to A)$ or any suitable $\\psi$ that makes the $H2$ instance work. Thus, at least three axiom instances (two from $H1$, one from $H2$) and two MP steps are necessary, totaling $5$ lines.\n\nHence, the minimal derivation cost is $C = 5$.\n\nThis derivation also clarifies the translation and mapping: the natural deduction \"assumption\" step corresponds to instantiations of $H1$ that encode the availability of $A$ under additional conditions, and the natural deduction $\\to$-introduction corresponds to using $H2$ to internalize the conditional proof, eliminating auxiliary antecedents and producing $A \\to A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3044431"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful applications of the Deduction Theorem is its ability to connect two different worlds: the syntactic world of formal proofs and the semantic world of truth values.

I will address the three tasks in order.\n\n### Task 1: Justification of Equivalence\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate that the validity of a logical argument is equivalent to its corresponding conditional formula being a tautology. This requires linking the semantic notion of validity ($\\models$) with the syntactic notion of provability ($\\vdash$) via the metatheorems of soundness and completeness, and then using the Deduction Theorem.\n\nLet $\\Gamma = \\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_n\\}$ be a set of premises and $\\psi$ be a conclusion, where each $\\phi_i$ and $\\psi$ are well-formed formulas in propositional logic.\n\n1.  **Definition of Argument Validity (Semantic Consequence):** An argument is defined as valid if and only if the conclusion $\\psi$ is a semantic consequence of the set of premises $\\Gamma$. This is denoted by $\\Gamma \\models \\psi$. By definition, $\\Gamma \\models \\psi$ means that for any truth valuation (assignment of truth values to propositional variables) $v$, if $v(\\phi_i) = \\text{True}$ for all $\\phi_i \\in \\Gamma$, then it must be that $v(\\psi) = \\text{True}$. In other words, there is no valuation that makes all premises true and the conclusion false.\n\n2.  **Definition of a Tautology:** A formula $\\alpha$ is a tautology if and only if it is true under every possible truth valuation. This is denoted by $\\models \\alpha$.\n\n3.  **Metatheorems of Soundness and Completeness:** These theorems establish the equivalence between semantic consequence ($\\models$) and syntactic provability ($\\vdash$).\n    *   **Soundness Theorem:** If a conclusion $\\psi$ is provable from a set of premises $\\Gamma$ (denoted $\\Gamma \\vdash \\psi$), then $\\psi$ is a semantic consequence of $\\Gamma$ (i.e., $\\Gamma \\models \\psi$). In short, `if $\\Gamma \\vdash \\psi$, then $\\Gamma \\models \\psi$`.\n    *   **Completeness Theorem:** If a conclusion $\\psi$ is a semantic consequence of a set of premises $\\Gamma$ (i.e., $\\Gamma \\models \\psi$), then $\\psi$ is provable from $\\Gamma$ (i.e., $\\Gamma \\vdash \\psi$). In short, `if $\\Gamma \\models \\psi$, then $\\Gamma \\vdash \\psi$`.\n    Together, these theorems state that $\\Gamma \\models \\psi$ if and only if $\\Gamma \\vdash \\psi$.\n\n4.  **The Deduction Theorem:** This theorem states that if a formula $\\psi$ is provable from a set of premises $\\Gamma$ augmented with an additional premise $\\phi$ (i.e., $\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\phi\\} \\vdash \\psi$), then the formula $\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi$ is provable from $\\Gamma$ alone (i.e., $\\Gamma \\vdash (\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi)$). The converse holds as well.\n\n5.  **Establishing the Equivalence:** We can now chain these concepts together.\n    *   The argument is valid if and only if $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_n\\} \\models \\psi$.\n    *   By the Completeness Theorem, this is equivalent to $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_n\\} \\vdash \\psi$.\n    *   This provability statement is equivalent to the provability from the single formula formed by the conjunction of the premises: $(\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2 \\land \\ldots \\land \\phi_n) \\vdash \\psi$.\n    *   By the Deduction Theorem (with $\\Gamma = \\emptyset$ and the premise being the conjunction), this is equivalent to $\\vdash ((\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2 \\land \\ldots \\land \\phi_n) \\rightarrow \\psi)$.\n    *   By the Soundness Theorem, this syntactic provability from no premises is equivalent to the semantic statement $\\models ((\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2 \\land \\ldots \\land \\phi_n) \\rightarrow \\psi)$.\n    *   By definition, this final statement means that the single implication formula $((\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2 \\land \\ldots \\land \\phi_n) \\rightarrow \\psi)$ is a tautology.\n\nTherefore, checking the validity of the argument is formally equivalent to checking the tautologicity of the single conditional formula where the antecedent is the conjunction of the premises and the consequent is the conclusion.\n\n### Task 2: Formation of the Implication Formula\n\nThe given argument has the following components:\nPremises:\n- $\\phi_1: P \\rightarrow Q$\n- $\\phi_2: Q \\rightarrow R$\n- $\\phi_3: (S \\lor T) \\rightarrow P$\n- $\\phi_4: \\neg T \\rightarrow S$\n\nConclusion:\n- $\\psi: R$\n\nFollowing the procedure justified in Task 1, we form a single implication formula $(\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2 \\land \\phi_3 \\land \\phi_4) \\rightarrow \\psi$. Substituting the specific formulas, we obtain:\n$$((P \\rightarrow Q) \\land (Q \\rightarrow R) \\land ((S \\lor T) \\rightarrow P) \\land (\\neg T \\rightarrow S)) \\rightarrow R$$\n\n### Task 3: Determining the Number of Falsifying Assignments\n\nWe need to find the number of truth assignments for the $5$ variables $P, Q, R, S, T$ for which the formula derived in Task 2 is false.\n\nLet the formula be $\\Phi$. A formula of the form $A \\rightarrow B$ is false if and only if the antecedent $A$ is true and the consequent $B$ is false.\nIn our case, this means:\n1.  The antecedent, which is the conjunction of all premises, must be true:\n    $$(P \\rightarrow Q) \\land (Q \\rightarrow R) \\land ((S \\lor T) \\rightarrow P) \\land (\\neg T \\rightarrow S) \\text{ is True.}$$\n2.  The consequent, the conclusion, must be false:\n    $$R \\text{ is False.}$$\n\nFor the conjunction of premises to be true, every individual premise must be true. Let a truth valuation be denoted by $v$, where $v(\\chi)=1$ for true and $v(\\chi)=0$ for false. The conditions for $\\Phi$ to be false are:\n- $v(R) = 0$\n- $v(P \\rightarrow Q) = 1$\n- $v(Q \\rightarrow R) = 1$\n- $v((S \\lor T) \\rightarrow P) = 1$\n- $v(\\neg T \\rightarrow S) = 1$\n\nLet's deduce the necessary truth values step-by-step.\nFirst, we use the fact that the premise $\\neg T \\rightarrow S$ is logically equivalent to $T \\lor S$. Thus, we must have $v(T \\lor S) = 1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the chain of implications formed by the premises, assuming they are all true:\n1.  From $v(\\neg T \\rightarrow S) = 1$, we know $v(T \\lor S) = 1$.\n2.  Consider the premise $v((S \\lor T) \\rightarrow P) = 1$. Since its antecedent $(S \\lor T)$ is true from the previous step, its consequent $P$ must also be true for the implication to hold. Therefore, $v(P) = 1$.\n3.  Consider the premise $v(P \\rightarrow Q) = 1$. Since its antecedent $P$ is true, its consequent $Q$ must also be true. Therefore, $v(Q) = 1$.\n4.  Consider the premise $v(Q \\rightarrow R) = 1$. Since its antecedent $Q$ is true, its consequent $R$ must also be true. Therefore, $v(R) = 1$.\n\nSo, for the set of premises to be simultaneously true, it is necessary that $v(P)=1$, $v(Q)=1$, and $v(R)=1$.\n\nHowever, the condition for the overall implication formula $\\Phi$ to be false requires the conclusion $R$ to be false, i.e., $v(R)=0$.\n\nWe have a direct contradiction. The assumption that the premises are all true leads to the necessary conclusion that $v(R)=1$. The assumption that the implication is false requires that $v(R)=0$. It is impossible for both of these conditions ($v(R)=1$ and $v(R)=0$) to be met.\n\nTherefore, there is no truth assignment for the variables $(P, Q, R, S, T)$ that can make the antecedent true and the consequent false simultaneously. The number of truth assignments under which the implication formula is false is zero.

A naive extension of the Deduction Theorem to a Hilbert system with an unrestricted Universal Generalization rule would incorrectly imply that $P(x) \\to \\forall x\\,P(x)$ is a theorem. To demonstrate that this formula is not, in fact, a logically valid statement (a tautology), we seek a countermodel, which is an interpretation (a structure $\\mathfrak{M}$ and a variable assignment $s$) in which the formula is false. The question is to find the smallest possible size of the domain of such a structure.\n\nLet the formula in question be $\\Phi$, where $\\Phi$ is $P(x) \\to \\forall x\\,P(x)$. For $\\Phi$ to be false in a structure $\\mathfrak{M}$ under a variable assignment $s$, its antecedent must be true and its consequent must be false.

The truth of a closed formula (one with no free variables) like $\\forall x\\,P(x)$ is independent of the variable assignment $s$. The formula $\\forall x\\,P(x)$ is true in $\\mathfrak{M}$ if and only if for every element $d \\in D$, it holds that $d \\in P^{\\mathfrak{M}}$.

This violates the second condition, which requires that $P^{\\mathfrak{M}}$ be a proper subset of $D$.
