It is defined by primitive recursion.\n  Base case: $G(0) = E(F_0, F_1) = E(0,1) = 2^0 \\cdot 3^1 = 3$. This is a constant function, which is PR.\n  Recursive step: $G(n+1) = U(G(n))$.\n  This fits the primitive recursion scheme $h(n+1) = g(n, h(n))$, where $g(n,y) = U(y)$ is PR. Thus, $G(n)$ is a PR function.\n\n- **Correctness of $G(n)$**: We prove by induction that $G(n) = E(F_n, F_{n+1}) = 2^{F_n} \\cdot 3^{F_{n+1}}$.\n  Base Case ($n=0$): $G(0) = 3 = 2^0 \\cdot 3^1 = E(0,1) = E(F_0, F_1)$. The property holds.\n  Inductive Step: Assume for some $k \\ge 0$ that $G(k) = E(F_k, F_{k+1})$.\n  We must show that $G(k+1) = E(F_{k+1}, F_{k+2})$.\n  From the definition, $G(k+1) = U(G(k))$.\n  Using the inductive hypothesis, $G(k) = 2^{F_k} \\cdot 3^{F_{k+1}}$.\n  From this, we have $v_2(G(k)) = F_k$ and $v_3(G(k)) = F_{k+1}$.\n  Applying the definition of $U$:\n  $G(k+1) = U(G(k)) = 2^{v_3(G(k))} \\cdot 3^{v_2(G(k)) + v_3(G(k))} = 2^{F_{k+1}} \\cdot 3^{F_k + F_{k+1}}$.\n  By the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, $F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k$.\n  Therefore, $G(k+1) = 2^{F_{k+1}} \\cdot 3^{F_{k+2}} = E(F_{k+1}, F_{k+2})$.\n  The property holds for $k+1$. By the principle of induction, the formula for $G(n)$ is correct for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n- **The Fibonacci Function $\\mathrm{Fib}(n)$**: The function is defined as $\\mathrm{Fib}(n) = v_2(G(n))$.\n  Since we have shown that $G(n) = 2^{F_n} \\cdot 3^{F_{n+1}}$, it follows that:\n  $\\mathrm{Fib}(n) = v_2(G(n)) = v_2(2^{F_n} \\cdot 3^{F_{n+1}}) = F_n$.\n  The function $\\mathrm{Fib}(n)$ is a composition of the PR functions $G$ and $v_2$, and is therefore a PR function that correctly computes the $n$th Fibonacci number.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem requires the computation of $\\mathrm{Fib}(9)$. Based on our construction, this is equivalent to finding the 9th Fibonacci number, $F_9$.\n$F_0 = 0$\n$F_1 = 1$\n$F_2 = F_1 + F_0 = 1+0=1$\n$F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1+1=2$\n$F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 2+1=3$\n$F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 3+2=5$\n$F_6 = F_5 + F_4 = 5+3=8$\n$F_7 = F_6 + F_5 = 8+5=13$\n$F_8 = F_7 + F_6 = 13+8=21$\n$F_9 = F_8 + F_7 = 21+13=34$\n\nThus, $\\mathrm{Fib}(9) = 34$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{34}$$", "id": "3049701"}]}
