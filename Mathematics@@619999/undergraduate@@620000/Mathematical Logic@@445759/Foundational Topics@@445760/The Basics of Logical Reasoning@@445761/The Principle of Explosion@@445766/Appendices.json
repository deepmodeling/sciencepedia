It is a standard exercise in proof theory, a branch of mathematical logic. The rules provided are standard for LJ. The question is precise and unambiguous.\n1.  **Scientific Soundness:** The problem is set within the formal framework of LJ and uses standard definitions and rules. It is factually sound.\n2.  **Formalizability:** The problem is inherently formal and mathematical.\n3.  **Completeness:** The problem provides all necessary information (the system, the rules, the goal).\n4.  **Feasibility:** The problem is theoretical and does not involve physical constraints.\n5.  **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for a minimal set of rules for a derivation, which is a question with a definite answer that can be determined by attempting to construct the proof.\n\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Sequent\n\nThe goal is to derive the sequent $A, \\neg A \\Rightarrow B$.\nFirst, we replace the defined symbol $\\neg A$ with its definition, $A \\to \\bot$. The sequent to be derived becomes:\n$$\nA, A \\to \\bot \\Rightarrow B\n$$\nWe construct the proof tree by working backward from this conclusion (the root of the tree).\n\nThe antecedent contains the formula $A \\to \\bot$, which has $\\to$ as its main connective. The only rule that can be applied to decompose this formula in the antecedent is the Implication Left ($\\to L$) rule.\nThe $\\to L$ rule is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma \\Rightarrow A \\quad \\Delta, B \\Rightarrow C}{\\Gamma, \\Delta, A \\to B \\Rightarrow C}\n$$\nTo apply this rule to our target sequent $A, A \\to \\bot \\Rightarrow B$, we make the following substitutions:\n*   The principal formula $A \\to B$ in the rule corresponds to $A \\to \\bot$ in our sequent.\n*   The succedent $C$ corresponds to $B$.\n*   The side formula $A$ in our antecedent, $A, A \\to \\bot \\Rightarrow B$, must be partitioned between the contexts $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ of the premises. Let the multiset of side formulas be $\\Xi = \\{A\\}$. We need to find $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ such that their multiset union is $\\Xi$. The two possibilities are $(\\Gamma = \\{A\\}, \\Delta = \\emptyset)$ or $(\\Gamma = \\emptyset, \\Delta = \\{A\\})$.\n\n**Possibility 1:** Let $\\Gamma = \\{A\\}$ and $\\Delta = \\emptyset$.\nThe rule application is:\n$$\n\\frac{A \\Rightarrow A \\quad \\emptyset, \\bot \\Rightarrow B}{A, \\emptyset, A \\to \\bot \\Rightarrow B} (\\to L)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{A \\Rightarrow A \\quad \\bot \\Rightarrow B}{A, A \\to \\bot \\Rightarrow B} (\\to L)\n$$\nNow we must check if the premises (the sequents above the line) are derivable.\n*   **Left Premise:** $A \\Rightarrow A$. This is a direct instance of the **Identity axiom**. This branch of the proof is complete.\n*   **Right Premise:** $\\bot \\Rightarrow B$. This sequent states that from falsum, the arbitrary formula $B$ can be derived. This is an instance of the principle of explosion, which is captured by the **Falsum Left ($\\bot L$) rule**. The rule is $\\frac{}{\\Delta', \\bot \\Rightarrow C'}$. Our sequent $\\bot \\Rightarrow B$ is an instance of this rule where the context $\\Delta'$ is empty and $C'$ is $B$. This is an axiom (a rule with no premises), so this branch is also complete.\n\n**Possibility 2:** Let $\\Gamma = \\emptyset$ and $\\Delta = \\{A\\}$.\nThe rule application would be:\n$$\n\\frac{\\emptyset \\Rightarrow A \\quad A, \\bot \\Rightarrow B}{\\emptyset, A, A \\to \\bot \\Rightarrow B} (\\to L)\n$$\nThe left premise, $\\Rightarrow A$, is not derivable for an arbitrary formula $A$. Therefore, this path does not yield a general proof.\n\nThe first possibility provides a successful derivation. The complete proof tree is:\n$$\n\\frac\n{A \\Rightarrow A \\quad \\frac{}{\\bot \\Rightarrow B}(\\bot L)}\n{A, A \\to \\bot \\Rightarrow B}(\\to L)\n$$\nThis derivation successfully proves $A, \\neg A \\Rightarrow B$.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Rules Used\n\nThe rules used in the successful derivation are:\n1.  **Identity ($A \\Rightarrow A$)**: Essential for the left premise. Without it, the sequent $A \\Rightarrow A$ cannot be proven.\n2.  **Implication Left ($\\to L$)**: Essential to decompose the principal formula $A \\to \\bot$. Without it, we cannot make use of the hypothesis $\\neg A$.\n3.  **Falsum Left ($\\bot L$)**: Essential for the right premise. It is the rule that formalizes the principle of explosion ($ex falso quodlibet$) and allows the derivation of an arbitrary formula $B$ from $\\bot$.\n\nThis set, {Identity, $\\to L$, $\\bot L$}, is sufficient. It is also minimal because, as argued, removing any of the three rules makes the derivation impossible.\n\nNow, we must assess if Contraction Left (CL) was needed. The CL rule is $\\frac{A, A, \\Gamma \\Rightarrow C}{A, \\Gamma \\Rightarrow C}$.\nIn our derivation, the antecedent of the conclusion is the multiset $\\{A, A \\to \\bot\\}$.\nAccording to the $\\to L$ rule, the antecedent of the left premise is $\\{A\\}$ and the antecedent of the right premise is $\\{\\bot\\}$. At no point in the derivation does a formula appear twice in an antecedent that then needs to be contracted into a single occurrence. The formula $A$ from the original context is used exactly once, in the left premise. Therefore, **Contraction Left is not needed**.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Identity ($A \\Rightarrow A$), $\\to L$, $\\bot L$; Contraction Left is not needed.**\n    *   This option lists the exact minimal set of rules {Identity, $\\to L$, $\\bot L$} that I found to be sufficient and necessary.\n    *   It also correctly states that Contraction Left is not needed for this derivation.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Identity ($A \\Rightarrow A$), $\\to L$, $\\bot L$, Cut; Contraction Left is not needed.**\n    *   This set includes the Cut rule, which was not used in the direct, cut-free derivation shown above.\n    *   Since a derivation exists without Cut, a set including Cut is not the \"smallest\" (minimal) set required. The problem specifically asks for the smallest set.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Identity ($A \\Rightarrow A$), $\\to L$, $\\bot L$; Contraction Left is needed to reuse $A$.**\n    *   The set of rules is correct.\n    *   However, the claim that Contraction Left is needed is false. As demonstrated in the derivation, the formula $A$ in the context is used in exactly one premise of the $\\to L$ rule application. There is no \"reuse\" that would necessitate contraction.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Identity ($A \\Rightarrow A$), $\\to L$; Contraction Left and Cut suffice in place of $\\bot L$.**\n    *   This option proposes a derivation without the $\\bot L$ rule. The rule $\\bot L$ is what allows the introduction of an arbitrary formula $B$ as the succedent when $\\bot$ is in the antecedent. Without this rule, there is no mechanism in the provided system to derive $\\Gamma \\Rightarrow B$ from a proof of $\\Gamma \\Rightarrow \\bot$. The rule $\\bot L$ is independent of the other rules in LJ (Identity, Cut, structural rules, and rules for $\\to$). One can derive $A, \\neg A \\Rightarrow \\bot$ using only Identity and $\\to L$, but moving from $\\bot$ in the succedent to an arbitrary formula $B$ requires the principle of explosion, which is what $\\bot L$ provides.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Identity ($A \\Rightarrow A$), $\\bot L$, Weakening Left; Contraction Left is not needed.**\n    *   This set omits the $\\to L$ rule. Without $\\to L$, it's impossible to analyze or \"use\" the formula $A \\to \\bot$ in the antecedent. The derivation cannot even begin. Therefore, the set is not sufficient.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the thorough derivation and analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the minimal set of required rules and accurately assesses the need for Contraction Left.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3057338"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how proof rules can conspire to create explosion, we now turn to a semantic solution for containing it.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and grounded in the established principles of paraconsistent logic, specifically Graham Priest's Logic of Paradox (LP). All terms are standard and the tasks are computationally verifiable. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe semantic framework of LP assigns to each formula $\\phi$ a value $v(\\phi) = (t,f)$, where $t, f \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The value $t=1$ indicates the formula is true, and $f=1$ indicates it is false. The three canonical values are:\n-   $T = (1,0)$, representing 'true only'.\n-   $F = (0,1)$, representing 'false only'.\n-   $B = (1,1)$, representing 'both true and false'.\n\nA value is considered 'designated' (or intuitively 'true') if its $t$-component is $1$. Thus, both $T$ and $B$ are designated values.\n\nThe \"standard truth- and falsity-conditions\" for logical connectives translate into algebraic rules on the $(t,f)$ pairs. Let $v(P) = (t_P, f_P)$ and $v(Q) = (t_Q, f_Q)$.\n\nFor negation ($\\neg$):\n-   $\\neg P$ is true if and only if $P$ is false. So, $t_{\\neg P} = f_P$.\n-   $\\neg P$ is false if and only if $P$ is true. So, $f_{\\neg P} = t_P$.\n-   This gives the rule: $v(\\neg P) = (f_P, t_P)$.\n\nFor material implication ($\\to$):\n-   $P \\to Q$ is true if and only if $P$ is false or $Q$ is true. The 'or' is inclusive. This means $t_{P \\to Q} = 1$ if $f_P = 1$ or $t_Q = 1$. This corresponds to the operation $t_{P \\to Q} = \\max(f_P, t_Q)$.\n-   $P \\to Q$ is false if and only if $P$ is true and $Q$ is false. This means $f_{P \\to Q} = 1$ if $t_P = 1$ and $f_Q = 1$. This corresponds to the operation $f_{P \\to Q} = \\min(t_P, f_Q)$ (or $t_P \\cdot f_Q$).\n-   This gives the rule: $v(P \\to Q) = (\\max(f_P, t_Q), \\min(t_P, f_Q))$.\n\nFor conjunction ($\\land$), required for the second part:\n-   $P \\land Q$ is true if and only if $P$ is true and $Q$ is true. This corresponds to $t_{P \\land Q} = \\min(t_P, t_Q)$.\n-   $P \\land Q$ is false if and only if $P$ is false or $Q$ is false.

It is not metaphorical, unrealistic, or outside the scope of mathematical verification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Classical Closure ($C$)**\n\nThe knowledge base is $K = \\{p, \\neg p\\}$. In classical propositional logic, a knowledge base containing a formula and its negation, such as $\\{p, \\neg p\\}$, is a contradiction.\n\nAccording to the principle of explosion (ex contradictione quodlibet), which is a theorem of classical logic, a contradiction entails any arbitrary formula. Formally, for any formula $\\psi$ in the language, we have $\\{p, \\neg p\\} \\vdash_{\\mathrm{CL}} \\psi$.\n\nTherefore, the classical closure of $K$, denoted $\\mathrm{Cn}_{\\mathrm{CL}}(K)$, contains every well-formed formula of the propositional language.\n\nThe set $C$ is defined as the intersection of this closure with the query set $\\Phi$:\n$$C = \\mathrm{Cn}_{\\mathrm{CL}}(K) \\cap \\Phi$$\nSince every formula in $\\Phi$ is, by definition, a well-formed formula, and $\\mathrm{Cn}_{\\mathrm{CL}}(K)$ contains all such formulas, the intersection is simply the set $\\Phi$ itself.\n$$C = \\Phi$$\n\n**Part 2: Paraconsistent Closure ($P$)**\n\nThe paraconsistent logic used is First Degree Entailment (FDE). The closure is $P = \\mathrm{Cn}_{\\mathrm{FDE}}(K) \\cap \\Phi$. We must determine which formulas $\\varphi \\in \\Phi$ are FDE-entailed by $K = \\{p, \\neg p\\}$.\n\nThe condition for entailment $K \\vDash_{\\mathrm{FDE}} \\varphi$ is that for any valuation $v$ where all formulas in $K$ are designated, $\\varphi$ must also be designated. A value is designated if its truth component $t$ is $1$.\n\nLet's first analyze the constraint imposed by the knowledge base $K=\\{p, \\neg p\\}$. A valuation $v$ satisfies the premises if both $p$ and $\\neg p$ are designated.\n1. For $p$ to be designated, we must have $t(p) = 1$. This means $v(p)$ can be $\\mathbf{T}=(1,0)$ or $\\mathbf{B}=(1,1)$.\n2. For $\\neg p$ to be designated, we must have $t(\\neg p) = 1$. By definition, $v(\\neg p) = (f(p), t(p))$, so we need $f(p) = 1$.\nCombining both conditions, we need $t(p)=1$ and $f(p)=1$. The only truth value that satisfies this is $v(p) = \\mathbf{B} = (1,1)$.\n\nThus, a formula $\\varphi$ is in $\\mathrm{Cn}_{\\mathrm{FDE}}(K)$ if and only if for every valuation $v$ such that $v(p) = \\mathbf{B}$, the formula $\\varphi$ is designated (i.e., $t(\\varphi)=1$). Note that the values of other atomic propositions, $v(q)$ and $v(r)$, can be any of the four FDE values.\n\nWe now test each formula $\\varphi \\in \\Phi$ against this condition.\n\n- **$p$**: If $v(p) = \\mathbf{B} = (1,1)$, then $t(p)=1$. So $p$ is designated. Thus, $p \\in P$.\n- **$\\neg p$**: If $v(p) = \\mathbf{B} = (1,1)$, then $v(\\neg p) = (1,1) = \\mathbf{B}$, which means $t(\\neg p)=1$. So $\\neg p$ is designated. Thus, $\\neg p \\in P$.\n- **$p \\wedge \\neg p$**: If $v(p) = \\mathbf{B}$, then $v(\\neg p) = \\mathbf{B}$. The truth component is $t(p \\wedge \\neg p) = \\min(t(p), t(\\neg p)) = \\min(1,1) = 1$. So $p \\wedge \\neg p$ is designated. Thus, $p \\wedge \\neg p \\in P$.\n- **$p \\vee r$**: Given $v(p) = \\mathbf{B}$, the truth component is $t(p \\vee r) = \\max(t(p), t(r)) = \\max(1, t(r)) = 1$, regardless of the value of $v(r)$. So $p \\vee r$ is always designated. Thus, $p \\vee r \\in P$.\n- **$\\neg p \\vee r$**: Given $v(p) = \\mathbf{B}$, we have $v(\\neg p) = \\mathbf{B}$. The truth component is $t(\\neg p \\vee r) = \\max(t(\\neg p), t(r)) = \\max(1, t(r)) = 1$, regardless of the value of $v(r)$. So $\\neg p \\vee r$ is always designated. Thus, $\\neg p \\vee r \\in P$.\n- **$r$**: We need to check if $r$ is designated for all valuations where $v(p)=\\mathbf{B}$. Consider the valuation $v$ where $v(p)=\\mathbf{B}$ and $v(r)=\\mathbf{F}=(0,1)$. In this valuation, the premises $\\{p, \\neg p\\}$ are designated, but $r$ is not, since $t(r)=0$. This serves as a counter-model. Thus, $r \\notin P$.\n- **$q$**: Similar to $r$. Consider the valuation $v$ where $v(p)=\\mathbf{B}$ and $v(q)=\\mathbf{F}=(0,1)$. The premises are designated, but $q$ is not ($t(q)=0$). Thus, $q \\notin P$.\n- **$q \\vee r$**: Consider the valuation $v$ where $v(p)=\\mathbf{B}$, $v(q)=\\mathbf{F}=(0,1)$, and $v(r)=\\mathbf{F}=(0,1)$. The premises are designated. The truth component of the conclusion is $t(q \\vee r) = \\max(t(q), t(r)) = \\max(0,0) = 0$. The conclusion is not designated. This is a counter-model. Thus, $q \\vee r \\notin P$.\n- **$\\neg q$**: Consider the valuation $v$ where $v(p)=\\mathbf{B}$ and $v(q)=\\mathbf{T}=(1,0)$. The premises are designated. The conclusion is $\\neg q$, and its value is $v(\\neg q) = (f(q), t(q)) = (0,1) = \\mathbf{F}$. Its truth component is $t(\\neg q) = 0$, so it is not designated. This is a counter-model. Thus, $\\neg q \\notin P$.\n- **$r \\rightarrow q$ (defined as $\\neg r \\vee q$)**: Consider the valuation $v$ where $v(p)=\\mathbf{B}$, $v(r)=\\mathbf{T}=(1,0)$, and $v(q)=\\mathbf{F}=(0,1)$. The premises are designated. For the conclusion, we first find $v(\\neg r) = (f(r), t(r)) = (0,1) = \\mathbf{F}$. Then the truth component is $t(\\neg r \\vee q) = \\max(t(\\neg r), t(q)) = \\max(0,0) = 0$. The conclusion is not designated. This is a counter-model. Thus, $r \\rightarrow q \\notin P$.\n\nCombining these results, the set $P$ is:\n$$P = \\{\\,p,\\ \\neg p,\\ p \\wedge \\neg p,\\ p \\vee r,\\ \\neg p \\vee r\\,\\}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **Option A**: $C=\\Phi$ and $P=\\{\\,p,\\ \\neg p,\\ p \\wedge \\neg p,\\ p \\vee r,\\ \\neg p \\vee r\\,\\}$\n  - The calculation for $C$ is $C=\\Phi$, which is correct.\n  - The calculation for $P$ resulted in the exact set $\\{\\,p,\\ \\neg p,\\ p \\wedge \\neg p,\\ p \\vee r,\\ \\neg p \\vee r\\,\\}$, which matches the option.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **Option B**: $C=\\Phi$ and $P=\\{\\,p,\\ \\neg p,\\ p \\wedge \\neg p,\\ r,\\ p \\vee r,\\ \\neg p \\vee r\\,\\}$\n  - The statement for $C$ is correct.\n  - The statement for $P$ incorrectly includes $r$. As demonstrated, $r$ is not FDE-entailed by $K$ because a contradiction involving $p$ does not affect unrelated propositions.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option C**: $C=\\Phi$ and $P=\\Phi$\n  - The statement for $C$ is correct.\n  - The statement for $P$ is incorrect. It claims that FDE also leads to explosion, making all formulas in $\\Phi$ derivable. This is false; FDE is a paraconsistent logic specifically designed to avoid this. As shown above, formulas like $q$, $r$, $q \\vee r$, etc., are not entailed.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option D**: $C=\\Phi$ and $P=\\{\\,p,\\ \\neg p,\\ p \\vee r,\\ \\neg p \\vee r\\,\\}$\n  - The statement for $C$ is correct.\n  - The statement for $P$ incorrectly omits $p \\wedge \\neg p$. The inference rule of conjunction introduction ($A, B \\vdash A \\wedge B$) is valid in FDE. If $v$ designates $A$ and $B$, then $t(A)=1$ and $t(B)=1$. So $t(A \\wedge B) = \\min(t(A), t(B)) = 1$, meaning $A \\wedge B$ is also designated. Therefore, from $\\{p, \\neg p\\}$, we can conclude $p \\wedge \\neg p$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3057342"}]}
