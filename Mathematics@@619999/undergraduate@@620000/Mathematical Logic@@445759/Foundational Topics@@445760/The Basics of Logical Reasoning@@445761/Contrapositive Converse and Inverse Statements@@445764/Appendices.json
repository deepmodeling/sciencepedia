We are considering the truth of the universally quantified statement $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, (P(n) \\to Q(n))$.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Original Statement: $D_{4}(n) \\to E(n)$**\nThe statement is \"If $n$ is divisible by $4$, then $n$ is even.\"\nTo prove this, we assume the hypothesis $D_{4}(n)$ is true for an arbitrary integer $n$.\nBy definition of $D_{4}(n)$, there exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 4k$.\nWe can rewrite this expression as $n = 2(2k)$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, $2k$ is also an integer. Let $m = 2k$, so $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe expression becomes $n = 2m$.\nBy definition of $E(n)$, this means $n$ is even.\nThus, for any integer $n$, if $D_{4}(n)$ is true, then $E(n)$ is true. The implication $D_{4}(n) \\to E(n)$ is **true** for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**2. The Contrapositive**\nThe contrapositive of an implication $P \\to Q$ is $\\neg Q \\to \\neg P$.\nIn this case, the contrapositive is $\\neg E(n) \\to \\neg D_{4}(n)$.\nIn words: \"If $n$ is not even (i.e., $n$ is odd), then $n$ is not divisible by $4$.\"\n**Truth Value**: A contrapositive statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Since the original statement $D_{4}(n) \\to E(n)$ is true for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the contrapositive $\\neg E(n) \\to \\neg D_{4}(n)$ must also be **true** for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor a direct proof: Assume $\\neg E(n)$ is true. This means $n$ is an odd integer, so there exists an integer $j$ such that $n = 2j+1$. To show $\\neg D_{4}(n)$, we assume for contradiction that $D_{4}(n)$ is true. This means there is an integer $k$ such that $n=4k$. Equating the two expressions for $n$, we get $4k = 2j+1$, which implies $2(2k) = 2j+1$. The left side is an even number, while the right side is an odd number. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that $D_{4}(n)$ is true must be false. Hence, $\\neg D_{4}(n)$ is true. The contrapositive statement is true.\n\n**3. The Converse**\nThe converse of an implication $P \\to Q$ is $Q \\to P$.\nIn this case, the converse is $E(n) \\to D_{4}(n)$.\nIn words: \"If $n$ is even, then $n$ is divisible by $4$.\"\n**Truth Value**: To determine the truth value of this universally quantified statement, we check for a counterexample. A counterexample is an integer $n$ for which $E(n)$ is true, but $D_{4}(n)$ is false.\nConsider the integer $n=2$.\n- $E(2)$ is true, since $2 = 2 \\cdot 1$ and $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- $D_{4}(2)$ is false, as there is no integer $k$ for which $2 = 4k$. (This would require $k = 1/2$, which is not an integer).\nSince we have found an integer $n=2$ for which the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the implication $E(2) \\to D_{4}(2)$ is false. Therefore, the universal statement $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, (E(n) \\to D_{4}(n))$ is **false**. Another counterexample is $n=6$.\n\n**4. The Inverse**\nThe inverse of an implication $P \\to Q$ is $\\neg P \\to \\neg Q$.\nIn this case, the inverse is $\\neg D_{4}(n) \\to \\neg E(n)$.\nIn words: \"If $n$ is not divisible by $4$, then $n$ is not even (i.e., $n$ is odd).\"\n**Truth Value**: The inverse is logically equivalent to the converse. Since the converse $E(n) \\to D_{4}(n)$ was found to be false, the inverse $\\neg D_{4}(n) \\to \\neg E(n)$ must also be **false**.\n\nFor a direct proof: We look for a counterexample, which would be an integer $n$ for which $\\neg D_{4}(n)$ is true, but $\\neg E(n)$ is false. This means $n$ is not divisible by $4$, but $n$ is even.\nConsider the integer $n=2$.\n- $\\neg D_{4}(2)$ is true, because $2$ is not divisible by $4$.\n- $\\neg E(2)$ is false, because $2$ is an even number.\nSince we have found an integer $n=2$ for which the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the implication $\\neg D_{_{4}}(2) \\to \\neg E(2)$ is false. Therefore, the universal statement $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, (\\neg D_{4}(n) \\to \\neg E(n))$ is **false**.\n\n### Summary of Results\n- **Contrapositive**: $\\neg E(n) \\to \\neg D_{4}(n)$ is **true**.\n- **Converse**: $E(n) \\to D_{4}(n)$ is **false**.\n- **Inverse**: $\\neg D_{4}(n) \\to \\neg E(n)$ is **false**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Construct a two-variable truth table for $p$ and $q$. The statements $p \\to q$ and $\\neg q \\to \\neg p$ have identical truth values in all $4$ rows; the statement $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ differs from them exactly on the rows where $p$ and $q$ have different truth values.**\n\n- The first clause states that $p \\to q$ and its contrapositive $\\neg q \\to \\neg p$ are logically equivalent. Our truth table confirms this; both have the truth column $(T, F, T, T)$. This part is correct.\n- The second clause claims that $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ differs from $p \\to q$ exactly on the rows where $p$ and $q$ have different truth values.\n  - Row $2$: $p=T, q=F$. Here, $p \\to q$ is $F$ and $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ ($F \\to T$) is $T$. They differ.\n  - Row $3$: $p=F, q=T$. Here, $p \\to q$ is $T$ and $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ ($T \\to F$) is $F$. They differ.\n- Now we check the rows where $p$ and $q$ have the same truth values.\n  - Row $1$: $p=T, q=T$. Here, $p \\to q$ is $T$ and $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ is $T$. They are the same.\n  - Row $4$: $p=F, q=F$. Here, $p \\to q$ is $T$ and $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ is $T$. They are the same.\nThe statement is entirely accurate. The difference occurs only on the two rows where the truth values of $p$ and $q$ are mixed.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. It suffices to check a single valuation, namely $p=\\text{true}$ and $q=\\text{true}$; if two conditionals agree there, they are logically equivalent.**\n\n- This statement fundamentally misunderstands the definition of logical equivalence, which requires agreement across *all* possible valuations. To disprove it, we need a counterexample.\n- Consider the valuation $p=T, q=T$.\n  - $p \\to q$ evaluates to $T \\to T \\equiv T$.\n  - $q \\to p$ (the converse) evaluates to $T \\to T \\equiv T$.\n- The two statements agree for this single valuation. However, as established by the full truth table, $p \\to q$ and $q \\to p$ are not logically equivalent. For instance, when $p=T, q=F$, $p \\to q$ is $F$ while $q \\to p$ is $T$. Therefore, checking a single case is insufficient.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. To distinguish inverse and contrapositive, evaluate at $p=\\text{false}$ and $q=\\text{true}$. Then $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ is false while $\\neg q \\to \\neg p$ is true; hence they are not equivalent.**\n\n- Let's perform the evaluation at the specified valuation: $p=F, q=T$.\n- This implies $\\neg p = T$ and $\\neg q = F$.\n- The inverse is $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$, which becomes $T \\to F$. The result is $F$. The statement correctly says the inverse is false.\n- The contrapositive is $\\neg q \\to \\neg p$, which becomes $F \\to T$. The result is $T$. The statement correctly says the contrapositive is true.\n- Since we have found a valuation where the two statements have different truth values ($F$ and $T$), the conclusion that they are not logically equivalent is valid. This option provides a correct and specific demonstration of non-equivalence.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The inverse is logically equivalent to the original conditional $p \\to q$ because both are false only when $p$ is true and $q$ is false.**\n\n- The primary claim is that the inverse ($\\neg p \\to \\neg q$) is equivalent to the original ($p \\to q$). Our truth table shows this is false.\n- The reasoning provided is also flawed. Let's analyze it.\n  - When is the original $p \\to q$ false? Only when $p=T$ and $q=F$. This part is correct.\n  - When is the inverse $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$ false? Only when its antecedent $\\neg p$ is $T$ and its consequent $\\neg q$ is $F$. This requires $p=F$ and $q=T$.\n- The statement claims both are false under the same condition ($p=T, q=F$), which is factually incorrect. The original is false when $p=T, q=F$, while the inverse is false when $p=F, q=T$. The entire premise of the \"because\" clause is wrong.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The converse $q \\to p$ is logically equivalent to the inverse $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$; thus a truth table will show matching columns for these two statements across all $4$ rows.**\n\n- This statement claims an equivalence between the converse and the inverse.\n- Let's refer to our master truth table.\n  - The column for the converse, $q \\to p$, is $(T, T, F, T)$.\n  - The column for the inverse, $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$, is $(T, T, F, T)$.\n- The columns are identical. This confirms that $q \\to p$ is logically equivalent to $\\neg p \\to \\neg q$. The statement is a correct assertion in classical logic. The consequence, that a truth table will show matching columns, is the very definition of this equivalence.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nFinal check of correct options: A, C, E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3039888"}]}
