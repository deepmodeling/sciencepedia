An argument is defined as invalid if there exists at least one valuation—an assignment of truth values to the propositional variables—for which all premises are true and the conclusion is false. We will systematically search for such a valuation, which is known as a counterexample. If a counterexample is found, the argument is invalid. If no such valuation can be constructed, the argument is valid.\n\nThe argument consists of four propositional variables ($p, q, r, s$), four premises, and one conclusion.\n\nPremises:\n1. $P_1: p \\to q$\n2. $P_2: r \\to s$\n3. $P_3: q$\n4. $P_4: \\neg s$\n\nConclusion:\n$C: p \\lor r$\n\nOur goal is to find a valuation (an assignment of 'true' or 'false' to each of $p, q, r, s$) that satisfies the condition $P_1 \\land P_2 \\land P_3 \\land P_4 \\land \\neg C$.\n\nLet's denote the truth value of a proposition $X$ by $v(X)$. A valuation is a function $v: \\{p, q, r, s\\} \\to \\{\\text{True}, \\text{False}\\}$. We are looking for a valuation $v$ such that $v(P_1) = v(P_2) = v(P_3) = v(P_4) = \\text{True}$ and $v(C) = \\text{False}$.\n\nLet's begin by forcing the conclusion to be false.\nAccording to the semantic definition of disjunction ($\\lor$), the proposition $p \\lor r$ is false if and only if both $p$ and $r$ are false.\nTherefore, for $v(C) = \\text{False}$, we must have:\n$v(p) = \\text{False}$\n$v(r) = \\text{False}$\n\nNext, we must ensure all premises are true under this partial assignment. Let's analyze the simpler premises first.\nFor premise $P_3: q$ to be true, we must have:\n$v(q) = \\text{True}$\n\nFor premise $P_4: \\neg s$ to be true, the proposition $s$ must be false. This gives:\n$v(s) = \\text{False}$\n\nAt this point, we have determined a candidate valuation for a counterexample:\n$v(p) = \\text{False}$\n$v(q) = \\text{True}$\n$v(r) = \\text{False}$\n$v(s) = \\text{False}$\n\nNow, we must verify if this specific valuation makes the remaining premises, $P_1$ and $P_2$, true.\n\nLet's check premise $P_1: p \\to q$.\nWe have $v(p) = \\text{False}$ and $v(q) = \\text{True}$.\nThe conditional $A \\to B$ is only false when $A$ is true and $B$ is false. In our case, the antecedent is false, so the conditional $p \\to q$ is true. Thus, $v(p \\to q) = \\text{True}$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nLet's check premise $P_2: r \\to s$.\nWe have $v(r) = \\text{False}$ and $v(s) = \\text{False}$.\nAgain, the conditional is true when the antecedent is false. Here, $v(r) = \\text{False}$, so the conditional $r \\to s$ is true. Thus, $v(r \\to s) = \\text{True}$. This condition is also satisfied.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a valuation:\n$p$ is False\n$q$ is True\n$r$ is False\n$s$ is False\n\nUnder this valuation:\n- $v(p \\to q) = v(\\text{False} \\to \\text{True}) = \\text{True}$.\n- $v(r \\to s) = v(\\text{False} \\to \\text{False}) = \\text{True}$.\n- $v(q) = \\text{True}$.\n- $v(\\neg s) = v(\\neg \\text{False}) = \\text{True}$.\n- $v(p \\lor r) = v(\\text{False} \\lor \\text{False}) = \\text{False}$.\n\nSince we have found a valuation where all four premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is, by definition, invalid.\n\nThe final step is to encode this valuation into the integer $N$ as specified by the formula:\n$$N = 8[p] + 4[q] + 2[r] + 1[s]$$\nwhere $[x]=1$ if $x$ is true and $[x]=0$ if $x$ is false.\n\nFrom our counterexample valuation:\n$[p] = 0$ (since $p$ is False)\n$[q] = 1$ (since $q$ is True)\n$[r] = 0$ (since $r$ is False)\n$[s] = 0$ (since $s$ is False)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$N = 8(0) + 4(1) + 2(0) + 1(0)$\n$N = 0 + 4 + 0 + 0$\n$N = 4$\nThe integer representing the counterexample valuation is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3037576"}, {"introduction": "While finding a counterexample disproves an argument, proving one requires a more constructive approach.

The allowed rules are the standard introduction and elimination rules for conjunction ($\\land$), disjunction ($\\lor$), and implication ($\\rightarrow$).\n\nFirst, we construct a Natural Deduction (ND) derivation of $E$ from $\\Gamma$. The derivation proceeds by disjunction elimination on the premise $A \\lor C$. This requires two sub-derivations: one that assumes $A$ and derives $E$, and another that assumes $C$ and derives $E$.\n\nThe formal derivation is presented below in a Fitch-style format:\n1. $(A \\rightarrow B) \\land (C \\rightarrow D)$   (Premise)\n2. $A \\lor C$   (Premise)\n3. $(B \\rightarrow E) \\land (D \\rightarrow E)$   (Premise)\n4. \\quad $\\boxed{A}$   (Assumption for $\\lor E$)\n5. \\quad $A \\rightarrow B$   ($\\land E$, $1$)\n6. \\quad $B$   ($\\rightarrow E$, $4, 5$)\n7. \\quad $B \\rightarrow E$   ($\\land E$, $3$)\n8. \\quad $E$   ($\\rightarrow E$, $6, 7$)\n9. \\quad $\\boxed{C}$   (Assumption for $\\lor E$)\n10. \\quad $C \\rightarrow D$   ($\\land E$, $1$)\n11. \\quad $D$   ($\\rightarrow E$, $9, 10$)\n12. \\quad $D \\rightarrow E$   ($\\land E$, $3$)\n13. \\quad $E$   ($\\rightarrow E$, $11, 12$)\n14. $E$   ($\\lor E$, $2$, $4-8$, $9-13$)\n\nThis derivation successfully shows that $\\Gamma \\vdash E$.\n\nSecond, we explain why this derivation is correct by appealing to the core concepts of validity and soundness in logic.\nA rule of inference is *valid* if it is truth-preserving: for any interpretation (truth-value assignment to the propositional variables), if the premises of the rule are true under that interpretation, the conclusion must also be true. All standard ND rules, including $\\land E$, $\\rightarrow E$, and $\\lor E$ used in the derivation, are valid. For instance, $\\rightarrow E$ (Modus Ponens) takes premises $P$ and $P \\rightarrow Q$ and concludes $Q$. If a truth assignment makes both $P$ and $P \\rightarrow Q$ true, the definition of the truth-function for $\\rightarrow$ mandates that $Q$ must also be true. A similar justification holds for $\\land E$ and for the more complex $\\lor E$ rule, which covers all possible cases arising from a disjunctive premise.\n\nThe Natural Deduction system is *sound*. A proof system is sound if and only if whatever can be derived syntactically is also a semantic consequence. Formally, if $\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi$, then $\\Gamma \\models \\varphi$. The relation $\\Gamma \\models \\varphi$ means that for every truth assignment that makes all formulas in the set $\\Gamma$ true, the formula $\\varphi$ is also true. The soundness of ND is a fundamental meta-theorem of logic, typically proven by induction on the length of the derivation. It guarantees that the step-by-step application of valid inference rules, starting from a set of premises, will only ever produce conclusions that are semantically entailed by those premises.\n\nTherefore, because we have constructed a formal derivation $\\Gamma \\vdash E$ in the sound system of Natural Deduction, we are guaranteed that $\\Gamma \\models E$. This means that in any possible state of affairs where all three premises in $\\Gamma$ are true, the conclusion $E$ must also be true. This is the definition of a correct (or valid) argument, and our derivation serves as a formal proof of this fact.\n\nThird, we determine the minimal number of rule applications for a *normal* ND derivation. A normal derivation is one that does not contain any \"detours,\" which are sequences where an introduction rule is immediately followed by an elimination rule for the same connective. The derivation constructed above is normal because it exclusively uses elimination rules ($\\land E$, $\\rightarrow E$, $\\lor E$), so there are no introduction rules to form a detour.\n\nTo find the minimal number of applications, we analyze the logical structure of the problem.\nThe premise $A \\lor C$ makes a proof by cases (the $\\lor E$ rule) the only viable overall strategy. This fixes the main structure of the proof:\n1. A sub-derivation of $E$ from the assumption $A$ (along with $\\Gamma$).\n2. A sub-derivation of $E$ from the assumption $C$ (along with $\\Gamma$).\n3. A final application of $\\lor E$ to conclude $E$.\n\nLet's analyze the minimal steps for the first sub-derivation, $A \\vdash E$:\na. To derive $E$, we must use one of the implications concluding in $E$ from the premise $(B \\rightarrow E) \\land (D \\rightarrow E)$. To use $B \\rightarrow E$, we need to derive $B$.\nb. To derive $B$ from the assumption $A$, we must use the implication $A \\rightarrow B$.\nc. To obtain $A \\rightarrow B$, we must apply $\\land E$ to the premise $(A \\rightarrow B) \\land (C \\rightarrow D)$. (1 rule application)\nd. With $A$ and $A \\rightarrow B$, we apply $\\rightarrow E$ to get $B$. (1 rule application)\ne. To obtain $B \\rightarrow E$, we must apply $\\land E$ to the premise $(B \\rightarrow E) \\land (D \\rightarrow E)$. (1 rule application)\nf. With $B$ and $B \\rightarrow E$, we apply $\\rightarrow E$ to get $E$. (1 rule application)\nThis sub-derivation necessarily requires $4$ rule applications. There is no shorter path.\n\nNow, we analyze the minimal steps for the second sub-derivation, $C \\vdash E$:\nThis case is symmetric to the first.\na. To derive $E$, we need $D$ to use the implication $D \\rightarrow E$.\nb. To derive $D$ from the assumption $C$, we must use $C \\rightarrow D$.\nc. To obtain $C \\rightarrow D$, we apply $\\land E$ to $(A \\rightarrow B) \\land (C \\rightarrow D)$. (1 rule application)\nd. With $C$ and $C \\rightarrow D$, we apply $\\rightarrow E$ to get $D$. (1 rule application)\ne. To obtain $D \\rightarrow E$, we apply $\\land E$ to $(B \\rightarrow E) \\land (D \\rightarrow E)$. (1 rule application)\nf. With $D$ and $D \\rightarrow E$, we apply $\\rightarrow E$ to get $E$. (1 rule application)\nThis sub-derivation also requires $4$ rule applications.\n\nFinally, the main derivation uses the premise $A \\lor C$, the first sub-derivation, and the second sub-derivation to conclude $E$ via one application of the $\\lor E$ rule.\n\nThe minimal total number of rule applications is the sum of the rules from both sub-derivations and the final $\\lor E$ rule:\nMinimal steps = (steps for $A \\vdash E$) + (steps for $C \\vdash E$) + ($1$ final step) = $4 + 4 + 1 = 9$.\n\nThe constructed derivation uses exactly $9$ rule applications (four $\\land E$, four $\\rightarrow E$, one $\\lor E$), matching this minimal count.\n1. ($\\land E$)\n2. ($\\rightarrow E$)\n3. ($\\land E$)\n4. ($\\rightarrow E$)\n5. ($\\land E$)\n6. ($\\rightarrow E$)\n7. ($\\land E$)\n8. ($\\rightarrow E$)\n9. ($\\lor E$)\nAny other structure for a normal proof is not possible, and no steps in this structure can be omitted. Thus, the minimal number of rule applications is $9$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{9}\n$$", "id": "3037595"}, {"introduction": "A logically perfect (valid) argument can be built upon a foundation of falsehoods, making it unconvincing for establishing truth. This crucial insight leads to the distinction between validity and soundness, which is central to applying logic in science, mathematics, and philosophy.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The solution is presented in four parts as requested by the task.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of a Valid but Unsound Argument**\n\nAn argument is defined as **valid** if its conclusion is a logical consequence of its premises. This is a property of the argument's form, not its content. An argument is **sound** if it is valid *and* all of its premises are true in the intended interpretation. To construct an argument that is valid but not sound, we must use a valid logical form but employ at least one premise that is factually false.\n\nA canonical example of a valid argument form is Universal Instantiation followed by Modus Ponens. Its structure in first-order logic is:\nPremise $1$: $\\forall x (A(x) \\rightarrow B(x))$\nPremise $2$: $A(c)$\nConclusion: $B(c)$\n\nWe will construct a concrete argument with this form.\n\n1.  **Domain of Discourse:** Let the domain $D$ be the set of all known animal species.\n\n2.  **Predicates and Constants:**\n    *   Let the unary predicate $M(x)$ denote \"$x$ is a mammal.\"\n    *   Let the unary predicate $A(x)$ denote \"$x$ is an aquatic animal (lives exclusively in water).\"\n    *   Let the individual constant $d$ denote \"the dolphin.\"\n\n3.  **The First-Order Argument:**\n    *   **Premise 1:** $\\forall x (M(x) \\rightarrow A(x))$.\n        *   In English: \"For any animal $x$, if $x$ is a mammal, then $x$ is an aquatic animal.\" (Or, more naturally, \"All mammals are aquatic.\")\n    *   **Premise 2:** $M(d)$.\n        *   In English: \"The dolphin is a mammal.\"\n    *   **Conclusion:** $A(d)$.\n        *   In English: \"Therefore, the dolphin is an aquatic animal.\"\n\n4.  **Verification of Validity and Soundness:**\n    *   **Validity:** The argument's form is a standard valid inference pattern in first-order logic. If it were the case that all mammals were aquatic, and that the dolphin is a mammal, it would necessarily follow that the dolphin is aquatic. The logical structure is impeccable.\n    *   **Soundness:** To assess soundness, we evaluate the truth of the premises in the **intended interpretation**, which we take to be standard biological facts.\n        *   **Premise 1: $\\forall x (M(x) \\rightarrow A(x))$**. This premise, \"All mammals are aquatic,\" is empirically **false**. There are many mammals that are terrestrial, such as lions, elephants, and humans. Since the universal quantification claims this property for all members of the domain, a single counterexample (e.g., a lion) is sufficient to falsify it.\n        *   **Premise 2: $M(d)$**. This premise, \"The dolphin is a mammal,\" is empirically **true**. Dolphins are classified as marine mammals.\n    *   **Verdict on Soundness:** Since Premise $1$ is false in the intended interpretation, the argument is **not sound**, despite being logically valid. It is noteworthy that in this particular example, the conclusion $A(d)$ happens to be true. This demonstrates that an unsound argument can, by chance, have a true conclusion. The lack of soundness means the argument itself provides no reliable justification for the conclusion's truth.\n\n**Part 2: Epistemic Implications**\n\nThe distinction between validity and soundness has profound epistemic implications, particularly concerning the concepts of justification and knowledge. Knowledge is often conceptualized as \"justified true belief.\"\n\nAn argument serves as a potential **justification** for its conclusion.\n*   A **valid** argument provides a *structurally correct* justification. It guarantees that the conclusion must be true *if* the premises are true. This is a conditional guarantee of truth preservation.\n*   A **sound** argument provides a *factually grounded* justification. Because it is valid (structurally correct) and its premises are true (factually correct), its conclusion is guaranteed to be true. A sound argument is thus a powerful tool for establishing knowledge.\n\nIn the case of our constructed argument, it is valid but not sound. Accepting its conclusion, $A(d)$ (\"The dolphin is an aquatic animal\"), based on this argument, would be epistemically problematic. While the conclusion itself happens to be true, the reasoning path is flawed because it relies on the false premise that all mammals are aquatic.\n\nIf a person were to believe the conclusion *solely on the basis of this argument*, their belief would be \"accidentally\" true, not genuinely known. Their justification is defective. They have arrived at a true conclusion from a false starting point ($\\forall x (M(x) \\rightarrow A(x))$). This illustrates a critical epistemic principle: **valid reasoning from false premises cannot generate knowledge**, even if the conclusion happens to be true. The link between the evidence (the premises) and the belief (the conclusion) is broken by the falsehood of the evidence, rendering the justification inadequate for knowledge.\n\n**Part 3: Abstraction to Propositional Skeleton**\n\nThe task requires abstracting the argument to its propositional form by first instantiating the universal premise for the specific individual, $d$.\n\n1.  The first-order argument is:\n    *   $\\forall x (M(x) \\rightarrow A(x))$\n    *   $M(d)$\n    *   Therefore, $A(d)$\n\n2.  First, we apply Universal Instantiation to the first premise with the constant $d$. This yields the specific conditional statement:\n    *   $M(d) \\rightarrow A(d)$\n\n3.  The argument can now be seen as involving three specific propositions:\n    *   The instantiated conditional: $M(d) \\rightarrow A(d)$\n    *   The second premise: $M(d)$\n    *   The conclusion: $A(d)$\n\n4.  We now abstract this to a purely propositional form as instructed.\n    *   Let $P$ denote the instantiated antecedent predicate claim: $M(d)$.\n    *   Let $Q$ denote the corresponding consequent predicate claim: $A(d)$.\n\n5.  Substituting these propositional variables, the argument form becomes:\n    *   Premise 1: $P \\rightarrow Q$\n    *   Premise 2: $P$\n    *   Conclusion: $Q$\n\nThis is the classic propositional argument form known as **Modus Ponens**.\n\n**Part 4: Computation**\n\nThe task is to compute the number of truth assignments to the set of propositional variables $\\{P, Q\\}$ for which both premises, ($P \\rightarrow Q$) and $P$, are simultaneously true.\n\nThe set of variables is $\\{P, Q\\}$, so there are $2^2 = 4$ possible truth assignments (rows in a truth table). We must evaluate the truth value of both premises for each assignment. The material conditional $P \\rightarrow Q$ is false only when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.\n\nLet's construct the truth table:\n\n| Assignment | $P$ | $Q$ | Premise 1: $P \\rightarrow Q$ | Premise 2: $P$ | Both Premises True? |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $1$ | T | T | T | T | **Yes** |\n| $2$ | T | F | F | T | No |\n| $3$ | F | T | T | F | No |\n| $4$ | F | F | T | F | No |\n\nWe analyze the column \"Both Premises True?\":\n*   In assignment $1$, where $P$ is true and $Q$ is true, the premise $P \\rightarrow Q$ is true and the premise $P$ is a true. Both are true.\n*   In assignment $2$, where $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, the premise $P \\rightarrow Q$ is false. The condition fails.\n*   In assignment $3$, where $P$ is false and $Q$ is true, the premise $P$ is false. The condition fails.\n*   In assignment $4$, where $P$ is false and $Q$ is false, the premise $P$ is false. The condition fails.\n\nThere is only one truth assignment—the case where both $P$ and $Q$ are true—for which both premises are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the number of truth assignments to $\\{P, Q\\}$ for which the premises $(P \\rightarrow Q)$ and $P$ are both true is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3037593"}]}
