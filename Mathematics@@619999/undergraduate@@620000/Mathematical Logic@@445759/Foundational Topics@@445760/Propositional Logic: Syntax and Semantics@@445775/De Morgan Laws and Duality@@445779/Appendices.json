The problem defines a specific unary operation $\\neg x$ which selects a complement for each $x$. We must verify that for every $x \\in L$, $\\neg x$ is indeed a complement of $x$. This requires checking the identities $x \\land \\neg x = 0$ and $x \\lor \\neg x = 1$ for all five elements of $L$. The foundational definitions of a lattice imply that the meet and join operations are commutative, i.e., $x \\land y = y \\land x$ and $x \\lor y = y \\lor x$.\n\n-   For $x=0$: The designated complement is $\\neg 0 = 1$.

It is noteworthy that for element $c$, $b$ is also a valid complement since $c \\land b = 0$ and $c \\lor b = 1$. The non-uniqueness of complements is characteristic of non-distributive lattices.\n\nSecond, we address Task 2: Demonstrate that $L$ is not distributive.\nA lattice is distributive if the law $x \\land (y \\lor z) = (x \\land y) \\lor (x \\land z)$ holds for all $x, y, z \\in L$. To show $L$ is not distributive, we need to find a single counterexample. Let us choose $x=a$, $y=b$, and $z=c$.\n\nWe compute the left-hand side (LHS) of the distributive law:\n$x \\land (y \\lor z) = a \\land (b \\lor c)$.\nFrom the problem's givens, $b \\lor c = 1$.\nTherefore, LHS $= a \\land 1 = a$.\n\nNext, we compute the right-hand side (RHS) of the distributive law:\n$(x \\land y) \\lor (x \\land z) = (a \\land b) \\lor (a \\land c)$.\nFrom the problem's givens, $a \\land b = 0$ and $a \\land c = 0$.\nTherefore, RHS $= 0 \\lor 0 = 0$.\n\nComparing the two sides, we have LHS $= a$ and RHS $= 0$. Since $a \\neq 0$, it follows that $a \\land (b \\lor c) \\neq (a \\land b) \\lor (a \\land c)$. The distributive law fails, and thus the lattice $L$ is not distributive.\n\nThird, we address Task 3: Compute explicitly $\\neg(b \\land c)$ and $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c$ and determine if the identity $\\neg(x \\land y) = \\neg x \\lor \\neg y$ holds for $x=b$ and $y=c$.\n\nWe first compute the expression $\\neg(b \\land c)$.\n1.  Evaluate the term inside the parentheses: $b \\land c$. From the problem definition, $b \\land c = 0$.\n2.  Apply the unary operation $\\neg$ to this result: $\\neg(0)$. From the problem definition, $\\neg 0 = 1$.\nSo, we find that $\\neg(b \\land c) = 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the expression $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c$.\n1.  Evaluate the individual terms: $\\neg b$ and $\\neg c$. From the problem definition, $\\neg b = a$ and $\\neg c = a$.\n2.  Compute the join of these results: $a \\lor a$. The idempotent law, $x \\lor x = x$, is a fundamental property of lattices and is given in the problem statement. Therefore, $a \\lor a = a$.\nSo, we find that $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c = a$.\n\nComparing the two results, we have $\\neg(b \\land c) = 1$ and $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c = a$. Since $a$ and $1$ are distinct elements of the lattice ($a  1$), we conclude that $\\neg(b \\land c) \\neq \\neg b \\lor \\neg c$. The De Morgan identity fails for this specific choice of complementation function $\\neg$ and elements $b, c$. This demonstrates that a complemented lattice is not necessarily a De Morgan algebra, a property typically associated with Boolean algebras, which are distributive.\n\nThe final answer requires the ordered pair $(\\neg(b \\land c), \\neg b \\lor \\neg c)$.
