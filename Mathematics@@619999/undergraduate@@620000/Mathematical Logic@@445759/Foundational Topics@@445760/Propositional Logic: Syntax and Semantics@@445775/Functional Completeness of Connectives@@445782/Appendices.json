A set of Boolean functions is functionally complete if and only if it is not a subset of any of the five maximal clones (Post's classes):\n$1.$ $T_0$: The set of $0$-preserving functions, for which $f(0, 0, \\dots, 0) = 0$.\n$2.$ $T_1$: The set of $1$-preserving functions, for which $f(1, 1, \\dots, 1) = 1$.\n$3.$ $L$: The set of linear functions, which can be expressed as $f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = a_0 \\oplus a_1 x_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_n x_n$ for some constants $a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $\\oplus$ denotes addition modulo $2$ (XOR).\n$4.$ $M$: The set of monotonic functions. A function $f$ is monotonic if for any two input vectors $a=(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ and $b=(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$, if $a_i \\le b_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, then $f(a) \\le f(b)$.\n$5.$ $S$: The set of self-dual functions. A function $f$ is self-dual if $f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\lnot f(\\lnot x_1, \\dots, \\lnot x_n)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of $\\lnot$ and $\\to$ with respect to these five classes.\n\nAnalysis of $\\lnot p$:\n- $T_0$: $\\lnot p$ is not $0$-preserving because $\\lnot 0 = 1 \\ne 0$. So, $\\lnot \\notin T_0$.\n- $T_1$: $\\lnot p$ is not $1$-preserving because $\\lnot 1 = 0 \\ne 1$. So, $\\lnot \\notin T_1$.\n- $L$: $\\lnot p$ is linear, as it can be written as $1 \\oplus p$. So, $\\lnot \\in L$.\n- $M$: $\\lnot p$ is not monotonic. We have $0 \\le 1$, but $\\lnot 0 = 1$ and $\\lnot 1 = 0$, and it is not the case that $1 \\le 0$. So, $\\lnot \\notin M$.\n- $S$: $\\lnot p$ is self-dual because $\\lnot(\\lnot(\\lnot p)) = \\lnot p$. So, $\\lnot \\in S$.\n\nAnalysis of $p \\to q$:\n- $T_0$: $p \\to q$ is not $0$-preserving because $0 \\to 0 = 1 \\ne 0$. So, $\\to \\notin T_0$.\n- $T_1$: $p \\to q$ is $1$-preserving because $1 \\to 1 = 1$. So, $\\to \\in T_1$.\n- $L$: $p \\to q$ is not linear. Its algebraic normal form is $p \\to q \\equiv 1 \\oplus p \\oplus pq$. The presence of the second-degree term $pq$ makes it non-linear. So, $\\to \\notin L$.\n- $M$: $p \\to q$ is not monotonic. Consider the input vectors $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. Component-wise, $(0,0) \\le (1,0)$. However, $(0 \\to 0) = 1$ and $(1 \\to 0) = 0$, and it is not the case that $1 \\le 0$. So, $\\to \\notin M$.\n- $S$: $p \\to q$ is not self-dual. We check if $p \\to q = \\lnot((\\lnot p) \\to (\\lnot q))$. The right side is $\\lnot(\\lnot(\\lnot p) \\lor (\\lnot q)) = \\lnot(p \\lor \\lnot q) = \\lnot p \\land q$. This is not equivalent to $p \\to q$. For $p=0, q=0$, $p \\to q = 1$ while $\\lnot p \\land q = 1 \\land 0 = 0$. So, $\\to \\notin S$.\n\nNow we evaluate $\\mathcal{I}(S)$ for each subset $S \\subseteq C$.\n\n1.  For $S = \\emptyset$: The empty set of connectives is not functionally complete. With no operators, one can only represent the identity functions on the variables (i.e., $f(p)=p$), but not even constant functions like $f(p)=0$ or $f(p)=1$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{I}(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n\n2.  For $S = \\{\\lnot\\}$: As requested, we test the completeness of this singleton. The set $\\{\\lnot\\}$ is not functionally complete. All functions that can be generated are unary (e.g., $\\lnot p$, $\\lnot\\lnot p = p$). It is impossible to generate any function of arity $n \\ge 2$, such as conjunction ($p \\land q$). In the context of Post's criterion, the set of functions generated by $\\{\\lnot\\}$ is entirely contained within the class of linear functions $L$ and the class of self-dual functions $S$. Since the set is subsumed by a maximal clone, it is not functionally complete. Thus, $\\mathcal{I}(\\{\\lnot\\}) = 0$.\n\n3.  For $S = \\{\\to\\}$: We also test this singleton. The set $\\{\\to\\}$ is not functionally complete. Our analysis showed that the implication connective $\\to$ is a member of the class $T_1$ (functions preserving $1$). Any function constructed using only variables and the $\\to$ connective will also be in $T_1$. Specifically, if all propositional variables in a formula built from $\\{\\to\\}$ are assigned the value $1$, every sub-expression of the form $A \\to B$ evaluates to $1 \\to 1 = 1$, and thus the entire formula evaluates to $1$. This means any expressible function $f$ must satisfy $f(1, 1, \\dots, 1) = 1$. However, there are many Boolean functions that do not have this property, such as $f(p) = \\lnot p$. Since not all functions can be generated, $\\{\\to\\}$ is not functionally complete. Thus, $\\mathcal{I}(\\{\\to\\}) = 0$.\n\n4.  For $S = \\{\\lnot, \\to\\}$: We check if this set is functionally complete. Using Post's criterion, a set of connectives is complete if, for each of the five maximal clones, at least one connective in the set is not in that clone.\n    - $T_0$: The set $\\{\\lnot, \\to\\}$ is not a subset of $T_0$ because $\\lnot \\notin T_0$.\n    - $T_1$: The set is not a subset of $T_1$ because $\\lnot \\notin T_1$.\n    - $L$: The set is not a subset of $L$ because $\\to \\notin L$.\n    - $M$: The set is not a subset of $M$ because $\\lnot \\notin M$ (and also $\\to \\notin M$).\n    - $S$: The set is not a subset of $S$ because $\\to \\notin S$.\n    Since the set $\\{\\lnot, \\to\\}$ is not contained in any of the five maximal clones, it is functionally complete.\n    Alternatively, working from first principles, we can show that a known complete set of connectives, like $\\{\\lnot, \\land\\}$, can be constructed. We already have $\\lnot$. Conjunction ($p \\land q$) can be expressed using $\\lnot$ and $\\to$ as $\\lnot(p \\to \\lnot q)$, since $p \\to \\lnot q \\equiv \\lnot p \\lor \\lnot q$, and $\\lnot(\\lnot p \\lor \\lnot q) \\equiv p \\land q$. Since we can construct a complete set, $\\{\\lnot, \\to\\}$ is itself functionally complete.\n    Therefore, $\\mathcal{I}(\\{\\lnot, \\to\\}) = 1$.\n\nThe problem also implicitly asks about the minimality of $C = \\{\\lnot, \\to\\}$. A set is minimal functionally complete if it is functionally complete and no proper subset is. We have shown that $\\{\\lnot, \\to\\}$ is functionally complete, while its proper non-empty subsets $\\{\\lnot\\}$ and $\\{\\to\\}$ are not. This confirms that $C$ is a minimal functionally complete set.\n\nFinally, we compute the required sum $N$:\n$$\nN \\;=\\; \\sum_{S\\subseteq C}\\mathcal{I}(S) \\;=\\; \\mathcal{I}(\\emptyset) + \\mathcal{I}(\\{\\lnot\\}) + \\mathcal{I}(\\{\\to\\}) + \\mathcal{I}(\\{\\lnot, \\to\\})\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$$\nN \\;=\\; 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 \\;=\\; 1\n$$\nThe result is a single integer, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3042442"}, {"introduction": "Not all sets of connectives are complete, even those that appear versatile.

The class $T_0$ of $0$-preserving functions:**\nA function $f$ of arity $n$ is in $T_0$ if $f(0, 0, \\dots, 0) = 0$. For an arity-$0$ function, this condition becomes $f()=0$.\n- For $c_0$: $c_{0}() = 0$. Thus, $c_0 \\in T_0$.\n- For $c_1$: $c_{1}() = 1 \\neq 0$. Thus, $c_1 \\notin T_0$.\n- For $\\mathrm{maj}$: $\\mathrm{maj}(0,0,0) = 1$ iff $0+0+0 \\ge 2$, which is false. So, $\\mathrm{maj}(0,0,0) = 0$. Thus, $\\mathrm{maj} \\in T_0$.\nSince $c_1 \\notin T_0$, the basis $B$ is not a subset of $T_0$. Therefore, $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}] \\not\\subseteq T_0$. This class counts towards $N$.\n\n**2. The class $T_1$ of $1$-preserving functions:**\nA function $f$ of arity $n$ is in $T_1$ if $f(1, 1, \\dots, 1) = 1$. For an arity-$0$ function, this condition becomes $f()=1$.\n- For $c_0$: $c_{0}() = 0 \\neq 1$. Thus, $c_0 \\notin T_1$.\n- For $c_1$: $c_{1}() = 1$. Thus, $c_1 \\in T_1$.\n- For $\\mathrm{maj}$: $\\mathrm{maj}(1,1,1) = 1$ iff $1+1+1 \\ge 2$, which is true. So, $\\mathrm{maj}(1,1,1) = 1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{maj} \\in T_1$.\nSince $c_0 \\notin T_1$, the basis $B$ is not a subset of $T_1$. Therefore, $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}] \\not\\subseteq T_1$. This class counts towards $N$.\n\n**3. The class $M$ of monotone functions:**\nA function $f$ is monotone if for any two input vectors $a=(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ and $b=(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$, if $a \\leq b$ (meaning $a_i \\leq b_i$ for all $i$), then $f(a) \\leq f(b)$.\n- For $c_0$ and $c_1$: Constant functions are trivially monotone. The condition holds vacuously for arity-$0$ functions. Thus, $c_0 \\in M$ and $c_1 \\in M$.\n- For $\\mathrm{maj}$: Let $a=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and $b=(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ be input vectors such that $a \\leq b$. This implies $\\sum x_i \\leq \\sum y_i$. The value of $\\mathrm{maj}(z_1, z_2, z_3)$ is non-decreasing as the sum $\\sum z_i$ increases. If $\\mathrm{maj}(a)=1$, then $\\sum x_i \\geq 2$. So $\\sum y_i \\geq \\sum x_i \\geq 2$, which implies $\\mathrm{maj}(b)=1$. Thus $f(a) \\leq f(b)$ always holds.

Thus, $c_1 \\notin S$.\n- For $\\mathrm{maj}$: We check if $\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z) = \\overline{\\mathrm{maj}(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})}$.\n$\\overline{\\mathrm{maj}(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})} = 1$ iff $\\mathrm{maj}(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})=0$.\n$\\mathrm{maj}(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})=0$ iff $(1-x)+(1-y)+(1-z) < 2$, which means $3-(x+y+z) < 2$, or $1 < x+y+z$.\nSo, $\\overline{\\mathrm{maj}(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})} = 1$ iff $x+y+z \\ge 2$.\nThis is precisely the definition of $\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z)=1$. The functions are identical. Thus, $\\mathrm{maj} \\in S$.\nSince $c_0 \\notin S$ and $c_1 \\notin S$, the basis $B$ is not a subset of $S$. Therefore, $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}] \\not\\subseteq S$. This class counts towards $N$.\n\n**5. The class $L$ of affine functions:**\nA function $f$ is affine if its algebraic normal form (ANF) is a polynomial of degree at most $1$. That is, $f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = a_0 \\oplus a_1x_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_nx_n$ for some coefficients $a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n- For $c_0$: $c_0()=0$ is an affine polynomial of degree $0$ (with $a_0 = 0$). Thus, $c_0 \\in L$.\n- For $c_1$: $c_1()=1$ is an affine polynomial of degree $0$ (with $a_0 = 1$). Thus, $c_1 \\in L$.\n- For $\\mathrm{maj}$: We can determine its ANF.\n$\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z) = (x \\land y) \\lor (y \\land z) \\lor (z \\land x)$.\nUsing $a \\lor b = a \\oplus b \\oplus ab$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z) = (xy \\lor yz) \\lor zx = (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus (xy)(yz)) \\lor zx$\n$= (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz) \\lor zx$\n$= (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz) \\oplus zx \\oplus (xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz)(zx)$\n$= xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz \\oplus zx \\oplus x^2yz \\oplus yz^2x \\oplus x^2yz^2$\nSince $v^2=v$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$= xy \\oplus yz \\oplus xyz \\oplus zx \\oplus xyz \\oplus xyz \\oplus xyz$\n$= xy \\oplus yz \\oplus zx \\oplus (1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1)xyz = xy \\oplus yz \\oplus zx$.\nThe ANF is $\\mathrm{maj}(x,y,z) = xy \\oplus xz \\oplus yz$. This polynomial has degree $2$, which is greater than $1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{maj}$ is not an affine function. $\\mathrm{maj} \\notin L$.\nSince $\\mathrm{maj} \\notin L$, the basis $B$ is not a subset of $L$. Therefore, $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}] \\not\\subseteq L$. This class counts towards $N$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe clone $[\\{\\mathrm{maj}, c_{0}, c_{1}\\}]$ is not a subset of the following classes:\n- $T_0$ (due to $c_1$)\n- $T_1$ (due to $c_0$)\n- $S$ (due to $c_0$ and $c_1$)\n- $L$ (due to $\\mathrm{maj}$)\n\nThe number of such classes is $4$.\nThe clone is a subset only of the class $M$.\nThe value of $N$ is the number of classes for which the clone is not a subset.\nSo, $N = 4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3042445"}, {"introduction": "Beyond Post's five classes, we can gain deep insight by treating Boolean functions as polynomials over the two-element field, $\\mathbb{F}_2$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, as requested by the problem statement. The core of the analysis relies on properties of the functions in the clone, specifically the property of being 1-preserving and the property of being affine.\n\n#### 1. Definability of the negation connective $\\neg$\n\nFirst, we identify a property that is shared by all functions in the clone generated by $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$. A Boolean function $f$ of arity $m$ is called $1$-preserving if $f(1, 1, \\dots, 1) = 1$. We will show that every function in the generated clone is $1$-preserving.\n\nThe clone is generated by the constant function $1$, the connective $\\leftrightarrow$, and all projection functions $\\pi_i^n$. Let's check if these generators are $1$-preserving.\n- The constant function $f() = 1$ is trivially $1$-preserving.\n- A projection function $\\pi_i^m(x_1, \\dots, x_m) = x_i$ is $1$-preserving because $\\pi_i^m(1, \\dots, 1) = 1$.\n- The equivalence connective $g(x, y) = x \\leftrightarrow y$, represented as $1 \\oplus x \\oplus y$, is $1$-preserving because $g(1, 1) = 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 = 1$.\n\nNext, we must show that the property of being $1$-preserving is closed under composition. Let $f$ be an $m$-ary $1$-preserving function, and let $g_1, \\dots, g_m$ be $n$-ary $1$-preserving functions. The composition $h(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = f(g_1(x_1, \\dots, x_n), \\dots, g_m(x_1, \\dots, x_n))$ must also be $1$-preserving.\nEvaluating $h$ at $(1, \\dots, 1)$:\n$$h(1, \\dots, 1) = f(g_1(1, \\dots, 1), \\dots, g_m(1, \\dots, 1))$$\nSince each $g_i$ is $1$-preserving, $g_i(1, \\dots, 1) = 1$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$h(1, \\dots, 1) = f(1, \\dots, 1)$$\nSince $f$ is $1$-preserving, $f(1, \\dots, 1) = 1$. Thus, $h(1, \\dots, 1) = 1$, and $h$ is $1$-preserving.\n\nBy induction, any function constructed from the initial set of $1$-preserving generators through composition must also be $1$-preserving. Therefore, every function in the clone generated by $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$ is $1$-preserving.\n\nNow, consider the negation connective, $\\neg x$. Its algebraic representation is $1 \\oplus x$. To determine if $\\neg$ is definable, we check if it is $1$-preserving:\n$$\\neg(1) = 1 \\oplus 1 = 0$$\nSince $\\neg(1) = 0 \\neq 1$, the negation connective is not $1$-preserving. As all functions in the clone generated by $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$ must be $1$-preserving, $\\neg$ cannot be a member of this clone. Therefore, it is not definable from $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$.\n\n#### 2. Characterization of the clone generated by $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$\n\nWe will now characterize the functions in this clone by their Algebraic Normal Form (ANF). An $n$-ary Boolean function $f$ is affine if its ANF is linear, i.e., of the form:\n$$f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = a_0 \\oplus a_1 x_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_n x_n = a_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n a_i x_i$$\nfor some coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nFirst, we show that all functions in the clone are affine. The generators are affine:\n- The constant function $1$ has ANF $1$ (with $a_0=1$ and $a_i=0$ for $i>0$).\n- Projection functions $\\pi_i^n(\\mathbf{x}) = x_i$ are affine (with $a_i=1$ and all other coefficients $0$).\n- The equivalence connective $g(x,y)=1 \\oplus x \\oplus y$ is affine.\n\nThe set of affine functions is closed under composition. Let $f(\\mathbf{y}) = c_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{j=1}^m c_j y_j$ and $g_j(\\mathbf{x}) = d_{j0} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n d_{ji} x_i$ be affine functions. Their composition $h(\\mathbf{x}) = f(g_1(\\mathbf{x}), \\dots, g_m(\\mathbf{x}))$ is:\n$$h(\\mathbf{x}) = c_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{j=1}^m c_j \\left(d_{j0} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n d_{ji} x_i\\right) = \\left(c_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{j=1}^m c_j d_{j0}\\right) \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \\left(\\bigoplus_{j=1}^m c_j d_{ji}\\right) x_i$$\nThis resulting expression is also of affine form. Thus, the clone is a subset of the clone of all affine functions.\n\nFrom part 1, we know every function in the clone is $1$-preserving. An affine function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = a_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n a_i x_i$ is $1$-preserving if and only if $f(1, \\dots, 1) = 1$.\n$$f(1, \\dots, 1) = a_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n a_i(1) = a_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n a_i = 1$$\nThis condition means that the sum (XOR) of all coefficients in the ANF, including the constant term, must be $1$. This is equivalent to stating that the number of non-zero coefficients must be odd. Let's call the set of all such functions $C_{A1}$. The clone generated by $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$ is a subset of $C_{A1}$.\n\nTo show that the clone is exactly $C_{A1}$, we must show that any function in $C_{A1}$ can be generated from $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$. Let $f(\\mathbf{x}) = a_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_i$ be in $C_{A1}$, where $I \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is the set of indices for which $a_i=1$, and let $k = |I|$. The condition is $a_0 \\oplus k \\pmod 2 = 1$.\nLet us build functions by iterated composition of the generator $g(x,y) = 1 \\oplus x \\oplus y$. Let $S_k(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ be the function obtained by nesting $g$.\n$S_2(\\mathbf{x}) = g(x_1, x_2) = 1 \\oplus x_1 \\oplus x_2$.\n$S_3(\\mathbf{x}) = g(x_1, S_2(x_2, x_3)) = 1 \\oplus x_1 \\oplus (1 \\oplus x_2 \\oplus x_3) = x_1 \\oplus x_2 \\oplus x_3$.\n$S_4(\\mathbf{x}) = g(x_1, S_3(x_2, x_3, x_4)) = 1 \\oplus x_1 \\oplus (x_2 \\oplus x_3 \\oplus x_4)$.\nBy induction, for $k \\ge 2$, the ANF for $S_k(\\mathbf{x})$ is $c_k \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^k x_i$, where $c_k=1$ if $k$ is even and $c_k=0$ if $k$ is odd.\nNow, consider our arbitrary function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = a_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_i$ with $k=|I|$ variables.\n- If $k$ is odd, the $1$-preserving condition $a_0 \\oplus k \\pmod 2 = 1$ implies $a_0 \\oplus 1 = 1$, so $a_0=0$. The function is $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_i$. This is exactly $S_k$ applied to the variables $\\{x_i\\}_{i \\in I}$, which we can generate. (For $k=1$, we have a projection, which is in the clone).\n- If $k$ is even, the condition $a_0 \\oplus k \\pmod 2 = 1$ implies $a_0 \\oplus 0 = 1$, so $a_0=1$. The function is $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 1 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_i$. This is exactly $S_k$ applied to the variables $\\{x_i\\}_{i \\in I}$. (For $k=0$, we have the constant $1$, which is a generator).\n\nThus, any affine $1$-preserving function can be generated. The clone generated by $\\{\\leftrightarrow, 1\\}$ is precisely the set of all $n$-ary functions $f(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ whose ANF is of the form $a_0 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n a_i x_i$ with coefficients $a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ satisfying the condition $a_0 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_n = 1$.\n\n#### 3. Number of distinct $n$-ary Boolean functions in this clone\n\nFor a fixed arity $n \\ge 1$, we want to count the number of distinct functions in the clone. From part 2, each such function is uniquely determined by its ANF, which is specified by the coefficient vector $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{n+1}$.\nThe total number of coefficient vectors is $2^{n+1}$. These vectors must satisfy the single linear constraint:\n$$a_0 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_n = 1$$\nWe can choose the $n$ coefficients $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)$ freely. There are $2^n$ ways to do this. For each such choice, the value of the constant term $a_0$ is uniquely determined by the constraint:\n$$a_0 = 1 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_n$$\nSince the right side is an element of $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $a_0$ is always well-defined. Therefore, for each of the $2^n$ choices for the coefficients of the variables, there is exactly one valid choice for the constant term.\nThis means there are exactly $2^n$ such functions of arity $n$.\n\nFor example, for $n=1$, the functions are of the form $a_0 \\oplus a_1 x_1$ with $a_0 \\oplus a_1 = 1$. The possibilities are $(a_0, a_1) = (1,0)$ giving $f(x_1)=1$, and $(a_0, a_1) = (0,1)$ giving $f(x_1)=x_1$. There are $2^1=2$ functions.\nFor $n=2$, the functions are $a_0 \\oplus a_1 x_1 \\oplus a_2 x_2$ with $a_0 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus a_2 = 1$. There are $2^2=4$ choices for $(a_1, a_2)$, which then fix $a_0$. The functions are $1$, $x_1$, $x_2$, and $1 \\oplus x_1 \\oplus x_2$.\n\nThe number of distinct $n$-ary Boolean functions in this clone is $2^n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^n}\n$$", "id": "3042485"}]}
