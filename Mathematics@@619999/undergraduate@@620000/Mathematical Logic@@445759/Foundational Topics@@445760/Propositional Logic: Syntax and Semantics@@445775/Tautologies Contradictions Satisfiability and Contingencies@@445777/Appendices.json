It is a well-posed question within classical propositional logic, providing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe propositional formula under consideration is $\\varphi = (p \\to q) \\land (\\lnot q \\lor r)$.

All components required for a solution are provided.\n\nThe problem considers two propositional variables, denoted by $p$ and $q$. The set of truth values is $\\{\\top, \\bot\\}$, where $\\top$ represents 'true' and $\\bot$ represents 'false'. A truth valuation, $v$, is a function that assigns a truth value to each propositional variable. Since there are $2$ variables, there are $2^2 = 4$ distinct valuations for $(p, q)$.\n\nThe formula to be analyzed is $\\varphi = (p \\to q)$, where $\\to$ is the material conditional operator. According to the standard truth-conditional semantics, a formula $A \\to B$ is false if and only if its antecedent $A$ is true and its consequent $B$ is false. In all other cases, $A \\to B$ is true. Symbolically, for any valuation $v$, $v(p \\to q) = \\bot$ if and only if $v(p) = \\top$ and $v(q) = \\bot$. Otherwise, $v(p \\to q) = \\top$.\n\nWe proceed by enumerating all $4$ possible truth valuations and evaluating $\\varphi$ for each. This can be systematically organized in a truth table.\n\nThe $4$ valuations are:\n$1$. $v_1$: $v_1(p) = \\top$, $v_1(q) = \\top$\n$2$. $v_2$: $v_2(p) = \\top$, $v_2(q) = \\bot$\n$3$. $v_3$: $v_3(p) = \\bot$, $v_3(q) = \\top$\n$4$. $v_4$: $v_4(p) = \\bot$, $v_4(q) = \\bot$\n\nWe now evaluate $\\varphi = (p \\to q)$ under each valuation from first principles:\n1.  For $v_1(p) = \\top$ and $v_1(q) = \\top$:\n    $v_1(\\varphi) = (\\top \\to \\top)$. This case does not match the condition for falsity (antecedent true, consequent false). Thus, $v_1(\\varphi) = \\top$.\n\n2.  For $v_2(p) = \\top$ and $v_2(q) = \\bot$:\n    $v_2(\\varphi) = (\\top \\to \\bot)$. This case matches the condition for the material conditional to be false.

The formula $\\varphi$ is false under valuation $v_2$ (where $p$ is $\\top$ and $q$ is $\\bot$). Therefore, $\\varphi$ is not a tautology.\n- A contradiction is a formula false under all valuations. The formula $\\varphi$ is true under valuations $v_1$, $v_3$, and $v_4$. Therefore, $\\varphi$ is not a contradiction.\n- A contingency is a formula that is true under at least one valuation and false under at least one valuation.

We will address each task in sequence using valuation-based reasoning.\n\nFirst, we analyze the semantic entailment $\\varphi \\models \\psi$. The definition of semantic entailment $\\varphi \\models \\psi$ states that for every valuation $v$, if $v(\\varphi)=T$, then it must also be the case that $v(\\psi)=T$. Here, a valuation is a function mapping the propositional variables $\\{p, q, r\\}$ to the set of truth values $\\{T, F\\}$. The formulas $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ only depend on the variables $p$ and $q$.\n\nTo justify that $\\varphi \\models \\psi$, we must consider all possible valuations $v$ for which $v(\\varphi)=T$. The formula $\\varphi$ is $p \\leftrightarrow q$. The biconditional operator $\\leftrightarrow$ yields the value $T$ (true) if and only if its operands have the same truth value. Thus, $v(p \\leftrightarrow q)=T$ holds under two conditions:\n1.  $v(p)=T$ and $v(q)=T$.\n2.  $v(p)=F$ and $v(q)=F$.\n\nWe now evaluate $v(\\psi) = v(p \\rightarrow q)$ for each of these cases. The conditional operator $\\rightarrow$ yields $F$ (false) only when its antecedent is $T$ and its consequent is $F$; otherwise, it yields $T$.\nIn Case 1 ($v(p)=T, v(q)=T$):\n$v(\\psi) = v(p \\rightarrow q) = v(T \\rightarrow T) = T$.\nIn Case 2 ($v(p)=F, v(q)=F$):\n$v(\\psi) = v(p \\rightarrow q) = v(F \\rightarrow F) = T$.\nIn both possible cases where $v(\\varphi)=T$, we find that $v(\\psi)=T$. Therefore, by the definition of semantic entailment, we have demonstrated that $\\varphi \\models \\psi$.\n\nSecond, we must justify that the reverse entailment $\\psi \\not\\models \\varphi$ holds. To do this, we must find a counterexample: a specific valuation $v$ for which $v(\\psi)=T$ and $v(\\varphi)=F$.\nWe need to satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n1. $v(\\psi) = v(p \\rightarrow q) = T$.\n2. $v(\\varphi) = v(p \\leftrightarrow q) = F$.\n\nThe first condition, $v(p \\rightarrow q) = T$, is true for all assignments to $p$ and $q$ except for the case where $v(p)=T$ and $v(q)=F$. So, the possibilities for $(v(p), v(q))$ are $(T,T)$, $(F,T)$, and $(F,F)$.\nThe second condition, $v(p \\leftrightarrow q) = F$, is true if and only if $p$ and $q$ have different truth values. The possibilities for $(v(p), v(q))$ are $(T,F)$ and $(F,T)$.\n\nTo find a valuation that satisfies both conditions, we take the intersection of the sets of satisfying assignments. The only assignment common to both sets is $(v(p), v(q)) = (F,T)$.\nLet's choose one such explicit valuation. Let $v$ be a valuation where $v(p)=F$ and $v(q)=T$. The truth value of $r$ does not affect $\\varphi$ or $\\psi$, so we can assign it arbitrarily, for instance $v(r)=T$. For this valuation $v$:\n$v(\\psi) = v(p \\rightarrow q) = v(F \\rightarrow T) = T$.\n$v(\\varphi) = v(p \\leftrightarrow q) = v(F \\leftrightarrow T) = F$.\nSince we have found a valuation $v$ where $v(\\psi)=T$ and $v(\\varphi)=F$, the definition of semantic entailment is not met. Thus, we have justified that $\\psi \\not\\models \\varphi$.\n\nThird, we must compute $N$, which is defined as the number of valuations $v$ of the set of variables $\\{p,q,r\\}$ such that $v(\\psi)=T$ and $v(\\varphi)=F$.\nAs established in the second part, the condition `$v(\\psi)=T$ and $v(\\varphi)=F$` is met if and only if $v(p)=F$ and $v(q)=T$.\nThe problem specifies that the valuations are defined over the set of variables $\\{p, q, r\\}$. A complete valuation $v$ is an assignment of truth values to all three variables, i.e., a function from $\\{p, q, r\\}$ to $\\{T, F\\}$.\nThe condition `$v(p)=F$ and $v(q)=T$` fixes the truth values for $p$ and $q$. However, the truth value of the variable $r$ is not constrained by this condition, as neither $\\varphi$ nor $\\psi$ depends on $r$.\nThe variable $r$ can be assigned either $T$ or $F$ independently of the assignments for $p$ and $q$. This leads to two distinct valuations that satisfy the given conditions:\n1.  The valuation where $v(p)=F$, $v(q)=T$, and $v(r)=T$.\n2.  The valuation where $v(p)=F$, $v(q)=T$, and $v(r)=F$.\n\nThere are no other possible assignments for $\\{p, q, r\\}$ that satisfy the condition. Therefore, the total number of such valuations is $2$.\nSo, $N=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3054916"}]}
