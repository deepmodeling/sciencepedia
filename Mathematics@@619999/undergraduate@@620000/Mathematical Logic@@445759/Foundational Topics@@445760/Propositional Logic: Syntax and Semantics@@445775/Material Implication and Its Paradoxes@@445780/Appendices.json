The argument is structured as follows:\nPremise 1: $P \\to Q$\nPremise 2: $Q$\nConclusion: $P$\n\nThe validity of this argument form is determined by whether there exist any valuations for which all premises are true while the conclusion is false. Such a valuation is called a counterexample. The problem asks for the fraction of all possible valuations on the set of variables $\\{P, Q\\}$ that constitute a counterexample.\n\nIn classical propositional logic with truth values $\\{0, 1\\}$, where $1$ corresponds to \"true\" and $0$ to \"false\", a valuation $v$ is a function that assigns a truth value to each propositional variable. For the two variables $P$ and $Q$, there are $2^2 = 4$ possible distinct valuations. The problem states that these four valuations are equally likely, each having a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe semantics of the logical connectives are truth-functional.\nThe material conditional, $P \\to Q$, is true (evaluates to $1$) in all cases except when the antecedent $P$ is true and the consequent $Q$ is false. Its truth table is:\n- If $v(P)=1$ and $v(Q)=1$, then $v(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- If $v(P)=1$ and $v(Q)=0$, then $v(P \\to Q)=0$.\n- If $v(P)=0$ and $v(Q)=1$, then $v(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- If $v(P)=0$ and $v(Q)=0$, then $v(P \\to Q)=1$.\n\nAn argument is invalid if and only if there is at least one valuation for which the conjunction of all its premises is true, but its conclusion is false. In this case, we are looking for valuations $v$ that satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously:\n1. The first premise is true: $v(P \\to Q) = 1$.\n2. The second premise is true: $v(Q) = 1$.\n3. The conclusion is false: $v(P) = 0$.\n\nWe can systematically examine all four possible valuations for the variables $P$ and $Q$ to find which ones, if any, satisfy these conditions. We can organize this analysis in a truth table.\n\nLet's denote the set of all valuations as $\\mathcal{V}$. The four valuations are:\n1. $v_1$, where $v_1(P)=1$ and $v_1(Q)=1$.\n2. $v_2$, where $v_2(P)=1$ and $v_2(Q)=0$.\n3. $v_3$, where $v_3(P)=0$ and $v_3(Q)=1$.\n4. $v_4$, where $v_4(P)=0$ and $v_4(Q)=0$.\n\nNow, for each valuation, we evaluate the premises and the conclusion.\n\nCase 1: Valuation $v_1$ ($v(P)=1, v(Q)=1$)\n- Premise 1: $v_1(P \\to Q)$. Since $v_1(P)=1$ and $v_1(Q)=1$, $v_1(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- Premise 2: $v_1(Q) = 1$.\n- Conclusion: $v_1(P) = 1$.\nIn this case, both premises are true, and the conclusion is also true.

Since $v_2(P)=1$ and $v_2(Q)=0$, $v_2(P \\to Q)=0$.\n- Premise 2: $v_2(Q) = 0$.\nIn this case, both premises are false. Since not all premises are true, this is not a counterexample.\n\nCase 3: Valuation $v_3$ ($v(P)=0, v(Q)=1$)\n- Premise 1: $v_3(P \\to Q)$.

This valuation is a counterexample and demonstrates the invalidity of the argument form \"affirming the consequent\". This is the explicit valuation witnessing the invalidity, as requested by the problem.\n\nCase 4: Valuation $v_4$ ($v(P)=0, v(Q)=0$)\n- Premise 1: $v_4(P \\to Q)$. Since $v_4(P)=0$ and $v_4(Q)=0$, $v_4(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- Premise 2: $v_4(Q) = 0$.\nIn this case, the first premise is true, but the second premise is false.

The definitions provided for a valuation, negation ($\\lnot$), and material implication ($\\to$) are standard. The concept of a counterexample to an argument form is a fundamental topic in logic. The problem contains all necessary information, is self-contained, and is free of contradictions or ambiguities. The condition $n \\geq 2$ ensures the existence of at least two distinct propositional variables, $P$ and $Q$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by analyzing the conditions that define a counterexample valuation. Let $v$ be such a valuation. It must satisfy the following three conditions:\n1. $v(\\lnot P) = 1$\n2. $v(\\lnot Q) = 0$\n3. $v(P \\to Q) = 1$\n\nWe analyze each condition using the provided semantic definitions.\n\nFrom the first condition, $v(\\lnot P) = 1$:\nThe semantic definition for negation states that $v(\\lnot \\varphi) = 1$ if and only if $v(\\varphi) = 0$. Applying this definition with $\\varphi = P$, we conclude that a counterexample valuation must satisfy:\n$$v(P) = 0$$\n\nFrom the second condition, $v(\\lnot Q) = 0$:\nThe definition of negation implies its contrapositive: $v(\\lnot \\varphi) = 0$ if and only if $v(\\varphi) = 1$. Applying this with $\\varphi = Q$, we find that a counterexample valuation must satisfy:\n$$v(Q) = 1$$\n\nThus, any counterexample valuation $v$ must assign the value $0$ to $P$ and the value $1$ to $Q$. This provides the primary characterization of the set of counterexample valuations.\n\nNow, we must check if these assignments are consistent with the third condition, $v(P \\to Q) = 1$. The semantic definition for material implication states that $v(\\varphi \\to \\psi) = 0$ if and only if $v(\\varphi) = 1$ and $v(\\psi) = 0$. For all other combinations of truth values for $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$, $v(\\varphi \\to \\psi) = 1$.\nSubstituting our determined values, $v(P) = 0$ and $v(Q) = 1$, we see that this case does not match the condition for the implication to be false (which requires $v(P) = 1$ and $v(Q) = 0$). Therefore, for any valuation where $v(P) = 0$ and $v(Q) = 1$, it is necessary that $v(P \\to Q) = 1$.\nThis confirms that the third condition is automatically satisfied by any valuation for which $v(P)=0$ and $v(Q)=1$.\n\nSo, the characterization of the set of counterexample valuations is complete: a valuation $v$ is a counterexample to the argument form \"denying the antecedent\" if and only if $v(P) = 0$ and $v(Q) = 1$. The truth values assigned by $v$ to any other propositional variables are irrelevant to satisfying the conditions for a counterexample.\n\nNext, we calculate the fraction of such valuations.\nThe total number of propositional variables is given as $n$. Since a valuation is a function from this set of $n$ variables to $\\{0, 1\\}$, and there are two choices for each variable's assignment, the total number of distinct valuations is $2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2$ ($n$ times), which is $2^n$.\n\nTo find the number of counterexample valuations, we count how many valuations satisfy the conditions $v(P) = 0$ and $v(Q) = 1$.\n- The value assigned to $P$ is fixed: $v(P)=0$. There is only $1$ choice.\n- The value assigned to $Q$ is fixed: $v(Q)=1$. There is only $1$ choice.\n- The set of variables contains $n$ distinct variables, including $P$ and $Q$. This leaves $n-2$ other variables. The truth values for these remaining $n-2$ variables can be chosen independently, with $2$ choices ($0$ or $1$) for each.\n\nThe total number of counterexample valuations is the product of the number of choices for each variable:\n$$ \\text{Number of counterexamples} = 1 \\times 1 \\times \\underbrace{2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2}_{n-2 \\text{ times}} = 2^{n-2} $$\n\nThe fraction of valuations that are counterexamples is the ratio of the number of counterexample valuations to the total number of valuations:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Number of counterexamples}}{\\text{Total number of valuations}} = \\frac{2^{n-2}}{2^n} $$\nUsing the law of exponents $\\frac{a^x}{a^y} = a^{x-y}$, we simplify the expression:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = 2^{(n-2)-n} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThe result is an exact rational number, independent of $n$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "3046529"}, {"introduction": "The paradoxes of material implication become particularly striking when viewed through a probabilistic lens, where our intuition about 'if-then' statements often aligns with conditional probability rather than logical truth functions.

The secondary task is to interpret this result in light of the concept of assertability of an indicative conditional, contrasting it with the conditional probability $\\Pr(Q \\mid P)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the logical structure of the material implication $P \\to Q$. The problem states that $P \\to Q$ is true in all cases except when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false. This condition, where $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, can be represented by the logical conjunction $P \\land \\neg Q$. The material implication $P \\to Q$ is thus logically equivalent to the negation of this case, namely $\\neg(P \\land \\neg Q)$.\n\nIn the context of probability theory, propositions are treated as events in a sample space. The probability of a proposition being true is the measure of the corresponding event set. Logical connectives translate to set-theoretic operations: conjunction ($\\land$) corresponds to intersection ($\\cap$), negation ($\\neg$) corresponds to the complement (e.g., $P^c$), and disjunction ($\\lor$) corresponds to union ($\\cup$).\n\nThe event corresponding to $P \\to Q$ is the complement of the event corresponding to $P \\land \\neg Q$. Let us denote the events corresponding to the propositions $P$ and $Q$ by the same symbols. The event for $P \\land \\neg Q$ is $P \\cap Q^c$. Therefore, the probability of the material implication is given by:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\to Q) = \\Pr(\\neg(P \\land \\neg Q)) = 1 - \\Pr(P \\cap Q^c)\n$$\nWe are given that propositions $P$ and $Q$ are probabilistically independent. A key property of independence is that if two events are independent, then their complements are also independent of each other and of the original events. Specifically, if $P$ and $Q$ are independent, then $P$ and $Q^c$ are also independent.\n\nThe probability of the intersection of two independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\cap Q^c) = \\Pr(P) \\times \\Pr(Q^c)\n$$\nWe are given $\\Pr(P) = 0.01$ and $\\Pr(Q) = 0.5$. The probability of the complement of $Q$ is:\n$$\n\\Pr(Q^c) = 1 - \\Pr(Q) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n$$\nNow, we can compute $\\Pr(P \\cap Q^c)$:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\cap Q^c) = 0.01 \\times 0.5 = 0.005\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this value back into the expression for $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\to Q) = 1 - \\Pr(P \\cap Q^c) = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995\n$$\nAlternatively, one can use the logical equivalence $P \\to Q \\equiv \\neg P \\lor Q$. The corresponding probability is $\\Pr(P^c \\cup Q)$. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c \\cup Q) = \\Pr(P^c) + \\Pr(Q) - \\Pr(P^c \\cap Q)\n$$\nGiven independence of $P$ and $Q$, $P^c$ and $Q$ are also independent.\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c) = 1 - \\Pr(P) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c \\cap Q) = \\Pr(P^c) \\times \\Pr(Q) = 0.99 \\times 0.5 = 0.495\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c \\cup Q) = 0.99 + 0.5 - 0.495 = 1.49 - 0.495 = 0.995\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, $\\Pr(P \\to Q) = 0.995$.\n\nFor the interpretive part, we are asked to contrast this with the conditional probability $\\Pr(Q \\mid P)$. The formula for conditional probability is:\n$$\n\\Pr(Q \\mid P) = \\frac{\\Pr(Q \\cap P)}{\\Pr(P)}\n$$\nDue to the independence of $P$ and $Q$, $\\Pr(Q \\cap P) = \\Pr(Q) \\times \\Pr(P)$.

This corresponds precisely to the conditional probability $\\Pr(Q \\mid P)$. In our case, this value is $0.5$, suggesting a moderate degree of belief; one is only $50\\%$ confident that $Q$ will occur given that $P$ has occurred.\n\nIn stark contrast, the probability of the material implication, $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$, is $0.995$, a value extremely close to $1$. This high probability does not arise from a strong connection between $P$ and $Q$ (indeed, they are independent). Rather, it is overwhelmingly influenced by the low probability of the antecedent, $\\Pr(P)=0.01$. Since the material implication $P \\to Q$ is true whenever $P$ is false (an event with probability $\\Pr(P^c) = 0.99$), the probability $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$ is guaranteed to be at least $0.99$.\n\nThis discrepancy is a classic illustration of the \"paradoxes of material implication\" when translated into a probabilistic framework. It demonstrates that equating the probability of an indicative conditional with the probability of the corresponding material implication leads to counter-intuitive results. The high value of $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$ reflects the logical truth that a conditional with a false antecedent is true, regardless of the consequent, rather than reflecting a meaningful, assertable connection between the antecedent and the consequent. This has led many logicians and philosophers to favor Adams's Thesis, which posits that the probability of an indicative conditional is best measured by the conditional probability, i.e., $\\Pr(\\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q) = \\Pr(Q \\mid P)$, not $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.995}\n$$", "id": "3046527"}]}
