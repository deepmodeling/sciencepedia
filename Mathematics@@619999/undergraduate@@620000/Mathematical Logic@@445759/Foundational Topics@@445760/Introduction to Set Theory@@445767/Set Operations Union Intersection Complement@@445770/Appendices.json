All concepts are well-defined and based on axiomatic principles.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information. The given cardinalities are consistent. A key check is whether the union of $A$ and $B$ can be contained within $U$.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the set equation $(X\\cup A)\\cap B = X$. Two sets are equal if and only if they contain the exact same elements. This principle can be expressed using membership: for any arbitrary element $u \\in U$, the logical statement $u \\in ((X\\cup A)\\cap B)$ must be equivalent to the statement $u \\in X$. We write this as:\n$$\nu \\in (X\\cup A)\\cap B \\iff u \\in X\n$$\nThis equivalence must hold for every element $u \\in U$. We analyze this condition by breaking down the universe $U$ into four disjoint partitions based on membership in sets $A$ and $B$. For each case, we will determine the constraint imposed on the membership of $u$ in set $X$. Let $p_X$ be the proposition $u \\in X$, $p_A$ be $u \\in A$, and $p_B$ be $u \\in B$. The equivalence becomes:\n$$\n((p_X \\lor p_A) \\land p_B) \\iff p_X\n$$\n\n**Case 1: The element $u$ is in $A \\cap B$.**\nIn this case, $p_A$ is true and $p_B$ is true. The logical equivalence becomes:\n$$\n((p_X \\lor \\text{True}) \\land \\text{True}) \\iff p_X\n$$\nThe left side simplifies: $(p_X \\lor \\text{True})$ is always True. So, $(\\text{True} \\land \\text{True})$ is True. The equivalence reduces to:\n$$\n\\text{True} \\iff p_X\n$$\nFor this to hold, $p_X$ must be true. This means $u \\in X$ is a necessary condition. Therefore, every element of $A \\cap B$ must be an element of $X$. This gives the first condition on $X$:\n$$\nA \\cap B \\subseteq X\n$$\n\n**Case 2: The element $u$ is in $A \\cap B^c$ (i.e., $u \\in A$ and $u \\notin B$).**\nIn this case, $p_A$ is true and $p_B$ is false. The logical equivalence becomes:\n$$\n((p_X \\lor \\text{True}) \\land \\text{False}) \\iff p_X\n$$\nThe left side simplifies: $(p_X \\lor \\text{True})$ is True. So, $(\\text{True} \\land \\text{False})$ is False. The equivalence reduces to:\n$$\n\\text{False} \\iff p_X\n$$\nFor this to hold, $p_X$ must be false. This means $u \\notin X$ is a necessary condition. Therefore, $X$ cannot contain any element from $A \\cap B^c$. This gives the condition $X \\cap (A \\cap B^c) = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Case 3: The element $u$ is in $A^c \\cap B$ (i.e., $u \\notin A$ and $u \\in B$).**\nIn this case, $p_A$ is false and $p_B$ is true. The logical equivalence becomes:\n$$\n((p_X \\lor \\text{False}) \\land \\text{True}) \\iff p_X\n$$\nThe left side simplifies: $(p_X \\lor \\text{False})$ is equivalent to $p_X$. So, $(p_X \\land \\text{True})$ is equivalent to $p_X$. The equivalence reduces to:\n$$\np_X \\iff p_X\n$$\nThis is a tautology. It is true regardless of the truth value of $p_X$. This means there is no restriction on the membership of $u$ in $X$. Elements from $A^c \\cap B$ may or may not be in $X$.\n\n**Case 4: The element $u$ is in $A^c \\cap B^c$ (i.e., $u \\notin A$ and $u \\notin B$).**\nIn this case, $p_A$ is false and $p_B$ is false.

Therefore, $X$ cannot contain any element from $A^c \\cap B^c$. This gives the condition $X \\cap (A^c \\cap B^c) = \\emptyset$.\n\nLet us summarize the conditions on $X$.\n1.  All elements of $A \\cap B$ must be in $X$.\n2.  No elements of $A \\cap B^c$ can be in $X$.\n3.  No elements of $A^c \\cap B^c$ can be in $X$.\n4.  Elements of $A^c \\cap B$ can be either in $X$ or not in $X$.\n\nConditions 2 and 3 state that $X$ must be disjoint from both $A \\cap B^c$ and $A^c \\cap B^c$. This is equivalent to $X$ being disjoint from their union, $(A \\cap B^c) \\cup (A^c \\cap B^c)$. Using the distributive law, this union is $(A \\cup A^c) \\cap B^c = U \\cap B^c = B^c$. So, $X \\cap B^c = \\emptyset$. This is equivalent to the statement that all elements of $X$ must be in $B$, or $X \\subseteq B$.\n\nCombining this with condition 1, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the set equation to hold are:\n$$\nA \\cap B \\subseteq X \\subseteq B\n$$\nThis means that any valid set $X$ must contain all elements of the set $A \\cap B$, and all its elements must belong to the set $B$. The structure of any such set $X$ is that it is formed by taking the union of the mandatory set $A \\cap B$ and some subset of the elements that are in $B$ but not in $A$. This latter set of \"optional\" elements is $B \\setminus (A \\cap B)$, which is also denoted $B \\cap A^c$.\n\nThe total number of possible sets $X$ is equal to the number of ways we can choose a subset of these optional elements. The set of optional elements is $B \\setminus (A \\cap B)$. We need to find its cardinality.\nUsing the rule for the cardinality of a set difference, where $S_1 \\subseteq S_2$, we have $|S_2 \\setminus S_1| = |S_2| - |S_1|$.\nSince $A \\cap B \\subseteq B$, the cardinality of the set of optional elements is:\n$$\n|B \\setminus (A \\cap B)| = |B| - |A \\cap B|\n$$\nUsing the given values $|B|=14$ and $|A\\cap B|=9$:\n$$\n|B \\setminus (A \\cap B)| = 14 - 9 = 5\n$$\nLet $S_{opt} = B \\setminus (A \\cap B)$. We have $|S_{opt}|=5$. Any valid set $X$ is of the form $X = (A \\cap B) \\cup Y$, where $Y$ is any subset of $S_{opt}$ (i.e., $Y \\in \\mathcal{P}(S_{opt})$). The number of such subsets $Y$ is given by the cardinality of the power set of $S_{opt}$, which is $2^{|S_{opt}|}$.\nThe total number of subsets $X$ that satisfy the equation is therefore:\n$$\nN = 2^{|B \\setminus (A \\cap B)|} = 2^{5}\n$$\nCalculating the final value:\n$$\n2^5 = 32\n$$\nThere are $32$ such subsets $X \\subseteq U$. The other cardinalities, $|U|=37$ and $|A|=23$, are consistent context but not needed for the final count, as the conditions on $X$ only depend on the sets $A \\cap B$ and $B$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{32}\n$$", "id": "3052501"}, {"introduction": "This final practice introduces a powerful and elegant formalism for reasoning about set relations: indicator functions.
