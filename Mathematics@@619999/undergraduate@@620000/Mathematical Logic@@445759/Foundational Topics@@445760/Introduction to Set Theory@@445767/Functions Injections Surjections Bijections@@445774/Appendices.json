No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a function $f$ between two finite sets, $A=\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and $B=\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$. The function is defined by the following mappings: $f(0)=a$, $f(1)=b$, $f(2)=c$, $f(3)=c$, $f(4)=d$, $f(5)=a$, and $f(6)=b$. We must determine if the function is injective or surjective, find the image and its cardinality, and compute the size of the fiber for each element in the codomain.\n\nFirst, we address the properties of injectivity and surjectivity using their formal definitions.\n\nA function $f: X \\to Y$ is defined as injective (or one-to-one) if for any two distinct elements $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ with $x_1 \\neq x_2$, their images are also distinct, i.e., $f(x_1) \\neq f(x_2)$. An equivalent statement is that if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then it must be that $x_1 = x_2$. To show that $f$ is not injective, we need to find a counterexample: two distinct elements in the domain $A$ that map to the same element in the codomain $B$.\nFrom the definition of $f$, we observe multiple such instances:\n1. $f(0) = a$ and $f(5) = a$. Since $0 \\neq 5$, the condition for injectivity is violated.\n2. $f(1) = b$ and $f(6) = b$. Since $1 \\neq 6$, this also violates the condition.\n3. $f(2) = c$ and $f(3) = c$. Since $2 \\neq 3$, this provides a third violation.\nCiting any one of these pairs is sufficient to prove that the function $f$ is not injective. For example, the elements $0$ and $5$ in the domain $A$ are distinct, yet they both map to the element $a$ in the codomain $B$.\n\nA function $f: X \\to Y$ is defined as surjective (or onto) if its image is equal to its codomain, i.e., $\\operatorname{im}(f) = Y$. This means that for every element $y \\in Y$, there must exist at least one element $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. To show that $f$ is not surjective, we must find an element in the codomain $B$ that is not the image of any element in the domain $A$.\nThe codomain is given as $B = \\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$. Let us examine the set of output values produced by $f$:\n- $a$ is an output, since $f(0) = a$.\n- $b$ is an output, since $f(1) = b$.\n- $c$ is an output, since $f(2) = c$.\n- $d$ is an output, since $f(4) = d$.\nThe element $e \\in B$ is never produced as an output; there is no $x \\in A$ for which $f(x) = e$. Since the image of $f$ does not include every element of the codomain $B$, the function $f$ is not surjective. A corollary of this is that for a function between finite sets $f:A \\to B$, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for surjectivity is $|A| \\ge |B|$. Here, $|A|=7$ and $|B|=5$, so surjectivity is possible, but the specific mapping of $f$ prevents it.\n\nNext, we determine the image of $f$, denoted $\\operatorname{im}(f)$, which is the set of all values that the function $f$ actually outputs.\n$\\operatorname{im}(f) = \\{ f(x) \\mid x \\in A \\} = \\{ f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5), f(6) \\}$.\nSubstituting the defined values, we get the multiset of outputs $\\{a, b, c, c, d, a, b\\}$. Since a set contains only unique elements, we write:\n$\\operatorname{im}(f) = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$.\nThe cardinality of the image, $|\\operatorname{im}(f)|$, is the number of elements in this set. Therefore, $|\\operatorname{im}(f)| = 4$.\n\nFinally, we compute the size of the fiber for each element $y \\in B$. The fiber of $y$, denoted $f^{-1}(y)$, is the set of all elements in the domain that map to $y$. Its size is the cardinality of this set, $|f^{-1}(y)|$. This is also known as the size of the preimage of $y$.\n- For $y=a$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(a) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=a \\}$. From the function definition, we find that $f(0)=a$ and $f(5)=a$. Thus, $f^{-1}(a) = \\{0, 5\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(a)| = 2$.\n- For $y=b$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(b) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=b \\}$. We have $f(1)=b$ and $f(6)=b$. Thus, $f^{-1}(b) = \\{1, 6\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(b)| = 2$.\n- For $y=c$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(c) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=c \\}$. We have $f(2)=c$ and $f(3)=c$. Thus, $f^{-1}(c) = \\{2, 3\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(c)| = 2$.\n- For $y=d$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(d) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=d \\}$. We have $f(4)=d$. Thus, $f^{-1}(d) = \\{4\\}$. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(d)| = 1$.\n- For $y=e$: The fiber is $f^{-1}(e) = \\{ x \\in A \\mid f(x)=e \\}$. As established earlier, no element in $A$ maps to $e$. Thus, $f^{-1}(e) = \\emptyset$, the empty set. The size of this fiber is $|f^{-1}(e)| = 0$.\n\nAs a check, the sum of the sizes of all fibers must equal the size of the domain:\n$|f^{-1}(a)| + |f^{-1}(b)| + |f^{-1}(c)| + |f^{-1}(d)| + |f^{-1}(e)| = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 7$.\nThis matches the cardinality of the domain, $|A|=7$, so the calculation is consistent.\n\nThe required final answer is a row matrix containing the values $(|\\operatorname{im}(f)|, |f^{-1}(a)|, |f^{-1}(b)|, |f^{-1}(c)|, |f^{-1}(d)|, |f^{-1}(e)|)$.\nSubstituting the computed values, we have $(4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3042673"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of fibers, this exercise investigates a subtle but crucial property related to injectivity.

The set $X$ is given as $\\{0, 2\\}$.\nSince $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\neq \\{0, 2\\}$, this statement is false. The failure of this equality demonstrates that $f^{-1}(f[X])=X$ does not hold in general, particularly when $f$ is not injective.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. For the given $f$ and $X$, $f^{-1}(f[X])=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$.**\nOur calculation above yielded exactly $f^{-1}(f[X]) = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\nThis statement is a correct computation for the given specific case.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. For any function $f$ and subset $X\\subseteq S$, $f^{-1}(f[X])=\\bigcup_{x\\in X} f^{-1}(\\{f(x)\\})$.**\nThis statement proposes a general identity. We will prove it from the definitions.\n- Let $s$ be an arbitrary element. We show $s \\in f^{-1}(f[X])$ if and only if $s \\in \\bigcup_{x\\in X} f^{-1}(\\{f(x)\\})$.\n- $s \\in f^{-1}(f[X])$\n  $\\iff f(s) \\in f[X]$ (by definition of preimage)\n  $\\iff \\exists x_0 \\in X$ such that $f(s) = f(x_0)$ (by definition of image)\n  $\\iff \\exists x_0 \\in X$ such that $s \\in f^{-1}(\\{f(x_0)\\})$ (by definition of fiber/preimage of a singleton)\n  $\\iff s \\in \\bigcup_{x\\in X} f^{-1}(\\{f(x)\\})$ (by definition of union)\nSince the logical equivalences hold, the two sets are equal for any function $f$ and any subset $X$ of its domain. This identity correctly expresses the set $f^{-1}(f[X])$ as a union of the fibers corresponding to the images of elements in $X$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. For the given $f$, the set $f^{-1}(f[X])$ is the smallest subset of $S$ containing $X$ that is a union of fibers of $f$.**\nThis statement makes three claims about the set $f^{-1}(f[X])$ for the given $f$ and $X$: (1) it contains $X$, (2) it is a union of fibers, and (3) it is the smallest such set.\nFirst, let's verify for the specific case:\n- Fibers of $f$:\n  - Fiber over $0$: $f^{-1}(\\{0\\}) = \\{s \\in S \\mid f(s)=0\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n  - Fiber over $1$: $f^{-1}(\\{1\\}) = \\{s \\in S \\mid f(s)=1\\} = \\{2, 3\\}$.\n- The set $f^{-1}(f[X])$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n- (1) Does it contain $X=\\{0, 2\\}$? Yes, $\\{0, 2\\} \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n- (2) Is it a union of fibers? Yes, $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} = \\{0, 1\\} \\cup \\{2, 3\\} = f^{-1}(\\{0\\}) \\cup f^{-1}(\\{1\\})$.\n- (3) Is it the smallest? Any subset of $S$ containing $X=\\{0, 2\\}$ must contain the element $0$ and the element $2$. If this subset must also be a union of fibers, it must contain the entire fiber containing $0$ (which is $\\{0, 1\\}$) and the entire fiber containing $2$ (which is $\\{2, 3\\}$). Therefore, the smallest such set must be the union of these two fibers, which is $\\{0, 1\\} \\cup \\{2, 3\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This is precisely $f^{-1}(f[X])$.\nThe statement is true for the specific case. In fact, it is true in general, as follows from statement C.\nFrom C, $f^{-1}(f[X]) = \\bigcup_{x\\in X} f^{-1}(\\{f(x)\\})$, which is manifestly a union of fibers. For any $x_0 \\in X$, $x_0$ is in the fiber $f^{-1}(\\{f(x_0)\\})$, which is part of the union, so $X \\subseteq f^{-1}(f[X])$. Finally, if $A$ is any set containing $X$ that is a union of fibers, say $A = \\bigcup_{y \\in Y_A} f^{-1}(\\{y\\})$, then for any $x \\in X$, $x \\in A$. This means $f(x) \\in Y_A$. Thus $f[X] \\subseteq Y_A$. This implies $f^{-1}(f[X]) = \\bigcup_{y \\in f[X]} f^{-1}(\\{y\\}) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{y \\in Y_A} f^{-1}(\\{y\\}) = A$. So $f^{-1}(f[X])$ is indeed the smallest such set.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. The equality $f^{-1}(f[X])=X$ holds for all subsets $X\\subseteq S$ if and only if $f$ is surjective.**\nThis is a general statement about a property of functions. Let's analyze the equivalence. The property is $f^{-1}(f[X])=X$ for all $X\\subseteq S$.\n- ($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $f^{-1}(f[X])=X$ for all $X\\subseteq S$. Does this imply $f$ is surjective? Let $f:\\{1\\} \\to \\{1, 2\\}$ be defined by $f(1)=1$. This function is not surjective. The only non-empty subsets of $S=\\{1\\}$ are $X=\\{1\\}$. For this $X$, $f[X]=\\{1\\}$, and $f^{-1}(f[X]) = f^{-1}(\\{1\\}) = \\{1\\} = X$. The condition holds. But $f$ is not surjective. So the forward implication is false.\n- ($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $f$ is surjective. Does this imply $f^{-1}(f[X])=X$ for all $X\\subseteq S$? Consider the function $f$ from the problem statement: $f:\\{0,1,2,3\\} \\to \\{0,1\\}$ is surjective. However, as shown in the analysis of A, for $X=\\{0,2\\}$, $f^{-1}(f[X])=\\{0,1,2,3\\} \\neq X$. So the backward implication is false.\n\nThe correct equivalence is that $f^{-1}(f[X])=X$ for all $X\\subseteq S$ if and only if $f$ is **injective**.\nProof of corrected equivalence:\n- If $f$ is injective, let $z \\in f^{-1}(f[X])$. Then $f(z) \\in f[X]$, so $f(z) = f(x)$ for some $x \\in X$. By injectivity, $z=x$, so $z \\in X$. Thus $f^{-1}(f[X]) \\subseteq X$. The inclusion $X \\subseteq f^{-1}(f[X])$ is always true. So $f^{-1}(f[X]) = X$.\n- If $f^{-1}(f[X])=X$ for all $X$, let $f(s_1)=f(s_2)$. Choose $X=\\{s_1\\}$. Then $f[X] = \\{f(s_1)\\}$. So $f^{-1}(f[X])=f^{-1}(\\{f(s_1)\\})$. Since $f(s_2)=f(s_1)$, $s_2 \\in f^{-1}(\\{f(s_1)\\})$. By assumption, this set equals $X=\\{s_1\\}$. Thus $s_2=s_1$. So $f$ is injective.\nThe statement in the option, linking the property to surjectivity, is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, statements B, C, and D are true.

Specifically, $f(n)$ should be an element of $A$ for even $n$ and an element of $B$ for odd $n$.

Then $h(n) = h(2k) = (k,0)$.\nSo, $f(n) = f(2k) = g(k,0) = \\alpha(k) = \\alpha(n/2)$. The image is in $A$.\n- If $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $h(n) = h(2k+1) = (k,1)$.\nSo, $f(n) = f(2k+1) = g(k,1) = \\beta(k) = \\beta((n-1)/2)$. The image is in $B$.\n\nThis construction satisfies the interleaving condition. The explicit formula for $f(n)$ is:\n$$ f(n) = \\begin{cases} \\alpha(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) & \\text{if } n \\pmod 2 = 0 \\\\ \\beta(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) & \\text{if } n \\pmod 2 = 1 \\end{cases} $$\n\n**Proof that $f$ is a bijection:**\nA composition of two bijections is a bijection. We have already proven that $h$ is a bijection. We will now prove that $g$ is a bijection.\n\n_1. Injectivity of $g$:_\nLet $(k_1, i_1)$ and $(k_2, i_2)$ be elements of $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$ such that $g(k_1, i_1) = g(k_2, i_2)$. Let this common value be $y$.\n- Case 1: $i_1=0$. Then $y = g(k_1, 0) = \\alpha(k_1)$. By definition of $\\alpha$, $y \\in A$.\nIf $i_2=1$, then $g(k_2, 1) = \\beta(k_2) = y$. Thus $y \\in B$. This implies $y \\in A \\cap B$. But we are given that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, so $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $i_2$ cannot be $1$, so $i_2=0$.\nWith $i_1=i_2=0$, we have $g(k_1, 0) = \\alpha(k_1)$ and $g(k_2, 0) = \\alpha(k_2)$. The equality $g(k_1, 0) = g(k_2, 0)$ implies $\\alpha(k_1) = \\alpha(k_2)$. Since $\\alpha$ is a bijection, it is injective, so $k_1=k_2$.\nThus, $(k_1, i_1) = (k_2, i_2)$.\n- Case 2: $i_1=1$. Then $y = g(k_1, 1) = \\beta(k_1)$, so $y \\in B$.\nA similar argument shows that this forces $i_2=1$. Then $\\beta(k_1) = \\beta(k_2)$, and since $\\beta$ is injective, $k_1=k_2$. Again, $(k_1, i_1) = (k_2, i_2)$.\nIn all cases, $g(k_1, i_1) = g(k_2, i_2)$ implies $(k_1, i_1) = (k_2, i_2)$. So, $g$ is injective.\n\n_2. Surjectivity of $g$:_\nLet $y$ be an arbitrary element in the codomain $A \\cup B$.\n- Case 1: $y \\in A$. Since $\\alpha: \\mathbb{N} \\to A$ is a bijection, it is surjective. Therefore, there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\alpha(k) = y$. Consider the pair $(k,0) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$. By definition, $g(k,0) = \\alpha(k) = y$. We have found a preimage for $y$.\n- Case 2: $y \\in B$. Since $\\beta: \\mathbb{N} \\to B$ is a bijection, it is surjective. Therefore, there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\beta(k) = y$. Consider the pair $(k,1) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0,1\\}$. By definition, $g(k,1) = \\beta(k) = y$. We have found a preimage for $y$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, any $y \\in A \\cup B$ belongs to exactly one of these cases. Thus, for any element in the codomain, a preimage exists. So, $g$ is surjective.\n\nSince $g$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.\n\nNow we can conclude about $f = g \\circ h$.\n- **Injectivity of $f$**: Let $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and assume $f(n_1)=f(n_2)$. This means $g(h(n_1)) = g(h(n_2))$. Since $g$ is injective, we must have $h(n_1)=h(n_2)$. Since $h$ is injective, we must have $n_1=n_2$. Thus $f$ is injective.\n- **Surjectivity of $f$**: Let $y \\in A\\cup B$. Since $g$ is surjective, there exists a pair $(k,i) \\in \\mathbb{N}\\times\\{0,1\\}$ such that $g(k,i)=y$. Since $h$ is surjective, there exists an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $h(n)=(k,i)$. Then, for this $n$, we have $f(n) = g(h(n)) = g(k,i) = y$. Thus for any $y \\in A \\cup B$, there is a preimage $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ under $f$. So $f$ is surjective.\n\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $A \\cup B$.
