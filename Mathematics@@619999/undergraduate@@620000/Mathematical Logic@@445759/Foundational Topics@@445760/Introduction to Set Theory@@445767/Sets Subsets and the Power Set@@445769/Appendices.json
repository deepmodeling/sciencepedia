The problem asks for the condition under which $L \\subseteq R$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the set $L = \\mathcal{P}(A \\setminus B)$. By definition, the power set of any set $X$, denoted $\\mathcal{P}(X)$, always contains the empty set $\\emptyset$ as one of its elements. This is because the empty set is a subset of every set. Applying this to the set $A \\setminus B$, regardless of what $A$ and $B$ are, the set $A \\setminus B$ is a set. Therefore, its power set $\\mathcal{P}(A \\setminus B)$ must contain the empty set.\nSo, we can state with certainty that for any sets $A$ and $B$:\n$$\n\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{P}(A \\setminus B)\n$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the set $R = \\mathcal{P}(A) \\setminus \\mathcal{P}(B)$. By the definition of set difference, a set $S$ is an element of $R$ if and only if $S$ is an element of $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ AND $S$ is NOT an element of $\\mathcal{P}(B)$.

We have already established that $\\emptyset$ is always an element of $L$. Let's check if $\\emptyset$ is an element of $R$.\n\nFor $\\emptyset$ to be in $R$, it must satisfy the two conditions:\n1. $\\emptyset \\subseteq A$\n2. $\\emptyset \\not\\subseteq B$\n\nThe first condition, $\\emptyset \\subseteq A$, is always true for any set $A$.\nThe second condition, $\\emptyset \\not\\subseteq B$, requires that the empty set is not a subset of set $B$. However, this is fundamentally false. The empty set $\\emptyset$ is a subset of *every* set, including $B$. Therefore, $\\emptyset \\subseteq B$ is always true for any set $B$.\n\nSince $\\emptyset \\subseteq B$, it follows from the definition of a power set that $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{P}(B)$.\nNow consider the definition of the set difference $R = \\mathcal{P}(A) \\setminus \\mathcal{P}(B)$. This set contains elements that are in $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ but not in $\\mathcal{P}(B)$. Since we have established that $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{P}(B)$, the empty set is explicitly excluded from $\\mathcal{P}(A) \\setminus \\mathcal{P}(B)$.\nSo, we can state with certainty that for any sets $A$ and $B$:\n$$\n\\emptyset \\notin \\mathcal{P}(A) \\setminus \\mathcal{P}(B)\n$$\n\nTo summarize our findings:\n- For any sets $A$ and $B$, $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{P}(A \\setminus B)$.\n- For any sets $A$ and $B$, $\\emptyset \\notin \\mathcal{P}(A) \\setminus \\mathcal{P}(B)$.\n\nSince there exists an element (the empty set) that is always in the left-hand set but never in the right-hand set, the left-hand set cannot be a subset of the right-hand set. This holds true regardless of our choice for sets $A$ and $B$.\n\nTherefore, the inclusion $\\mathcal{P}(A \\setminus B) \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(A) \\setminus \\mathcal{P}(B)$ is never true.
