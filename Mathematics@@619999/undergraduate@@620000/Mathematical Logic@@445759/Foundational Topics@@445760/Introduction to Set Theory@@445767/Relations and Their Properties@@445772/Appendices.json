The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solutions\n\nThe core principle for this combinatorial problem lies in understanding that a binary relation is a subset of $A \\times A$. The construction of a relation involves deciding which ordered pairs from $A \\times A$ are to be included in the subset.\n\nFirst, we establish the size of the set $A \\times A$. The Cartesian product $A \\times A$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \\in A$ and $b \\in A$. The cardinality of this set is given by:\n$$|A \\times A| = |A| \\times |A| = n \\times n = n^2$$\nThus, there are $n^2$ distinct ordered pairs that can potentially be elements of a binary relation on $A$.\n\n**(1) Total Number of Binary Relations on $A$**\n\nA binary relation is, by definition, any subset of $A \\times A$. The problem of counting all possible binary relations is therefore equivalent to counting all possible subsets of $A \\times A$.\nA set with cardinality $k$ has $2^k$ distinct subsets. This is because for each of the $k$ elements in the set, we can make an independent binary choice: either include the element in the subset or not.\nIn our case, the set is $A \\times A$ with cardinality $k = n^2$.\nTherefore, the total number of distinct binary relations on $A$ is the size of the power set of $A \\times A$, which is:\n$$N_{total} = 2^{|A \\times A|} = 2^{n^2}$$\n\n**(2) Number of Reflexive Binary Relations on $A$**\n\nA relation $R$ is reflexive if it contains all pairs of the form $(a,a)$ for every $a \\in A$. These pairs are called the diagonal elements of $A \\times A$. There are $n$ such diagonal elements, one for each element in $A$.\nLet's partition the set $A \\times A$ into two disjoint collections of pairs:\n- The set of diagonal pairs: $D = \\{(a,a) \\mid a \\in A\\}$. The cardinality of this set is $|D| = n$.\n- The set of off-diagonal pairs: $O = \\{(a,b) \\mid a, b \\in A, a \\neq b\\}$. The cardinality of this set is $|O| = |A \\times A| - |D| = n^2 - n$.\n\nFor a relation $R$ to be reflexive, it must contain every element of $D$. This means for each of the $n$ diagonal pairs, there is only $1$ choice: it must be included in $R$.\nFor the remaining $n^2 - n$ off-diagonal pairs, there are no constraints imposed by the reflexive property. For each of these pairs, we are free to either include it in $R$ or not. This gives $2$ independent choices for each of the $n^2 - n$ off-diagonal pairs.\n\nUsing the multiplication principle, the total number of ways to form a reflexive relation is the product of the number of choices for each group of pairs:\n$$N_{reflexive} = (1)^n \\times (2)^{n^2 - n} = 2^{n^2 - n}$$\n\n**(3) Number of Symmetric Binary Relations on $A$**\n\nA relation $R$ is symmetric if for any pair $(a,b) \\in A \\times A$, the presence of $(a,b)$ in $R$ necessitates the presence of $(b,a)$ in $R$.\nLet's again consider the partition of $A \\times A$ into diagonal and off-diagonal elements.\n\n- For the $n$ diagonal elements $(a,a)$: The symmetry condition is $(a,a) \\in R \\implies (a,a) \\in R$, which is a tautology. This means there is no restriction on the inclusion of diagonal elements in a symmetric relation. For each of the $n$ diagonal pairs, we have $2$ choices (include or not include). This gives a total of $2^n$ choices for the diagonal part of the relation.\n\n- For the $n^2 - n$ off-diagonal elements: These elements can be grouped into pairs of the form $\\{(a,b), (b,a)\\}$ where $a \\neq b$. The number of such pairs is half the number of off-diagonal elements: $\\frac{n^2 - n}{2}$.\nThe symmetry condition couples the choices for $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$. For each such pair of elements $\\{(a,b), (b,a)\\}$, we cannot make independent decisions. The choices are:\n1. Neither $(a,b)$ nor $(b,a)$ is in $R$.\n2. Both $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ are in $R$.\nWe cannot have one in $R$ and the other not. Thus, for each of the $\\frac{n^2 - n}{2}$ pairs of off-diagonal elements, we have exactly $2$ choices. This gives a total of $2^{\\frac{n^2 - n}{2}}$ choices for the off-diagonal part of the relation.\n\nBy the multiplication principle, the total number of symmetric relations is the product of the number of choices for the diagonal elements and the number of choices for the off-diagonal pairs:\n$$N_{symmetric} = (2^n) \\times \\left(2^{\\frac{n^2 - n}{2}}\\right)$$\nUsing the rule of exponents $x^p x^q = x^{p+q}$, we get:\n$$N_{symmetric} = 2^{n + \\frac{n^2 - n}{2}} = 2^{\\frac{2n + n^2 - n}{2}} = 2^{\\frac{n^2 + n}{2}}$$\nThis can also be written as $2^{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$.\n\nThe three required expressions are $2^{n^2}$, $2^{n^2 - n}$, and $2^{\\frac{n^2 + n}{2}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2^{n^2} & 2^{n^2 - n} & 2^{\\frac{n^2 + n}{2}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3050571"}, {"introduction": "Partial orders are one of the most important structures built from relations, modeling hierarchies and dependencies.

The relation $\\leq_R$ is defined as the smallest relation on $X$ that is reflexive, transitive, and contains the pairs $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, $(2,4)$, and $(3,5)$. This construction defines $\\leq_R$ as the reflexive transitive closure of the base relation $R_0 = \\{(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5)\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must explicitly determine the pairs in $\\leq_R$.\nThe relation must be reflexive, so it contains all pairs $(x,x)$ for $x \\in X$:\n$\\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)\\}$\n\nThe relation must contain the generating pairs:\n$\\{(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5)\\}$\n\nThe relation must be transitive.

Thus, for every $x \\in X$, $x \\leq_R x$. The relation is reflexive by definition.\n- **Transitivity**: The relation $\\leq_R$ was constructed as the transitive closure of a base set of pairs. Thus, if $x \\leq_R y$ and $y \\leq_R z$, the pair $(x,z)$ must be in $\\leq_R$. The relation is transitive by definition.\n- **Antisymmetry**: We must show that for any $x, y \\in X$, if $x \\leq_R y$ and $y \\leq_R x$, then $x=y$. This is equivalent to showing that for any distinct elements $x \\neq y$, it is not possible to have both $(x,y) \\in \\leq_R$ and $(y,x) \\in \\leq_R$. We can verify this by inspecting all non-reflexive pairs in $\\leq_R$:\n    - $(1,2) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(2,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(1,3) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(3,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(2,4) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(4,2) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(3,5) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(5,3) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(1,4) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(4,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\n    - $(1,5) \\in \\leq_R$, but $(5,1) \\notin \\leq_R$.\nSince no such symmetric pairs exist for distinct elements, the relation is antisymmetric.\nAs $\\leq_R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, it is a partial order on $X$.\n\nTask 2: Identify whether a least element and a greatest element exist.\n- **Least Element**: A least element is an element $\\ell \\in X$ such that for all $x \\in X$, $\\ell \\leq_R x$. Let's test the element $1$. We check if $1 \\leq_R x$ for all $x \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$:\n    - $1 \\leq_R 1$: True, from reflexivity.\n    - $1 \\leq_R 2$: True, it is a generating pair.\n    - $1 \\leq_R 3$: True, it is a generating pair.\n    - $1 \\leq_R 4$: True, by transitivity ($1 \\leq_R 2$ and $2 \\leq_R 4$).\n    - $1 \\leq_R 5$: True, by transitivity ($1 \\leq_R 3$ and $3 \\leq_R 5$).\nSince $1 \\leq_R x$ for all $x \\in X$, the element $1$ is the least element of $(X, \\leq_R)$.\n\n- **Greatest Element**: A greatest element is an element $g \\in X$ such that for all $x \\in X$, $x \\leq_R g$.\nFor an element to be the greatest, it must be comparable with and greater than or equal to all other elements. Let's consider the elements $4$ and $5$. The pair $(4,5)$ is not in $\\leq_R$, so $4 \\not\\leq_R 5$. The pair $(5,4)$ is also not in $\\leq_R$, so $5 \\not\\leq_R 4$. The elements $4$ and $5$ are incomparable.\nIf a greatest element $g$ existed, we would have to have $4 \\leq_R g$ and $5 \\leq_R g$. However, there is no element $y$ such that $4 \\leq_R y$ (for $y \\neq 4$) and no element $z$ such that $5 \\leq_R z$ (for $z \\neq 5$). The incomparability of elements $4$ and $5$ is sufficient to prove that no greatest element exists.\n\nTask 3: Identify the sets of minimal and maximal elements.\n- **Minimal Elements**: A minimal element is an element $m \\in X$ such that there is no $y \\in X$ with $y \\leq_R m$ and $y \\neq m$.\n    - We test element $1$: The only $y \\in X$ for which $y \\leq_R 1$ is $y=1$ (by inspection of the relation $\\leq_R$).

Therefore, none of these elements can be minimal.\n    - The set of minimal elements is $\\{1\\}$. This is consistent with the fact that $1$ is the least element; if a least element exists, it is the unique minimal element.\n\n- **Maximal Elements**: A maximal element is an element $M \\in X$ such that there is no $y \\in X$ with $M \\leq_R y$ and $M \\neq y$.\n    - We test element $1$: $1 \\leq_R 2$ and $1 \\neq 2$, so $1$ is not maximal.\n    - We test element $2$: $2 \\leq_R 4$ and $2 \\neq 4$, so $2$ is not maximal.\n    - We test element $3$: $3 \\leq_R 5$ and $3 \\neq 5$, so $3$ is not maximal.\n    - We test element $4$: We check if there exists any $y \\in X$ such that $4 \\leq_R y$ and $4 \\neq y$. By inspecting the set $\\leq_R$, there is no pair $(4,y)$ with $y \\neq 4$. Therefore, $4$ is a maximal element.\n    - We test element $5$: We check if there exists any $y \\in X$ such that $5 \\leq_R y$ and $5 \\neq y$. By inspecting the set $\\leq_R$, there is no pair $(5,y)$ with $y \\neq 5$. Therefore, $5$ is a maximal element.\n    - The set of maximal elements is $\\{4, 5\\}$.\n\nTask 4: Determine the number of maximal elements in $(X,\\leq_R)$.\nFrom the analysis in Task $3$, the set of maximal elements is $\\{4, 5\\}$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for a five-part analysis of a relation on the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, culminating in the determination of the cardinality of the automorphism group of a resulting algebraic structure.\n\nFirst, we address step 1: Prove that the relation $\\sim$ defined by $x \\sim y \\iff (x - y)$ is divisible by $3$ is an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\nReflexivity: For any integer $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must show $x \\sim x$. The difference is $x - x = 0$. Since $0 = 3 \\times 0$, $0$ is divisible by $3$. Thus, $x \\sim x$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSymmetry: For any two integers $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must show that if $x \\sim y$, then $y \\sim x$. Assume $x \\sim y$. By definition, this means $x - y$ is divisible by $3$. Therefore, there exists an integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x - y = 3k$. To check if $y \\sim x$, we examine the difference $y - x$. We have $y - x = -(x - y) = -(3k) = 3(-k)$. Since $k$ is an integer, $-k$ is also an integer. This shows that $y - x$ is divisible by $3$, which means $y \\sim x$.\n\nTransitivity: For any three integers $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we must show that if $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$, then $x \\sim z$. Assume $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$. This implies that $x - y$ is divisible by $3$ and $y - z$ is divisible by $3$. So, there exist integers $k, j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x - y = 3k$ and $y - z = 3j$. To check if $x \\sim z$, we examine the difference $x - z$. We can write $x - z = (x - y) + (y - z) = 3k + 3j = 3(k+j)$. Since $k$ and $j$ are integers, their sum $k+j$ is also an integer. This demonstrates that $x - z$ is divisible by $3$, which means $x \\sim z$.\n\nSince the relation $\\sim$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is proven to be an equivalence relation on $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSecond, for step 2, we construct the quotient set $\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$. The quotient set is the set of all distinct equivalence classes. The equivalence class of an integer $a$, denoted $[a]$, is the set of all integers related to $a$: $[a] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x \\sim a\\}$. The condition $x \\sim a$ is equivalent to $x-a$ being a multiple of $3$, or $x-a = 3k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This is equivalent to $x = a + 3k$. This means that an integer $x$ belongs to $[a]$ if and only if $x$ has the same remainder as $a$ upon division by $3$. By the Division Algorithm, any integer has a unique remainder of $0$, $1$, or $2$ when divided by $3$. This leads to exactly three distinct equivalence classes:\n$[0] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x = 3k, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{..., -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ...\\}$\n$[1] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x = 3k + 1, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{..., -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, ...\\}$\n$[2] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x = 3k + 2, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{..., -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, ...\\}$\nThe quotient set is therefore $\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim = \\{[0], [1], [2]\\}$.\n\nThird, for step 3, we analyze the operation $+$ on $\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$ defined by $[a] + [b] = [a + b]$. We first prove it is well-defined. Let $[a] = [a']$ and $[b] = [b']$. This means $a \\sim a'$ and $b \\sim b'$. So, $a - a' = 3k$ and $b - b' = 3j$ for integers $k, j$. We must show that the result of the operation is independent of the choice of representatives, i.e., $[a+b] = [a'+b']$. This is true if $(a+b) \\sim (a'+b')$. We check the difference: $(a+b) - (a'+b') = (a-a') + (b-b') = 3k + 3j = 3(k+j)$. Since $k+j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the difference is divisible by $3$, confirming that $(a+b) \\sim (a'+b')$. Thus, the operation is well-defined.\nNext, we verify that $(\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +)$ is an Abelian group.\nClosure: For any $[a], [b] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, $[a] + [b] = [a+b]$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $a+b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $[a+b] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$. The set is closed under the operation.\nAssociativity: For any $[a], [b], [c] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, we have $([a] + [b]) + [c] = [a+b] + [c] = [(a+b)+c]$. Also, $[a] + ([b] + [c]) = [a] + [b+c] = [a+(b+c)]$. Since integer addition is associative, $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$, so the operation is associative.\nIdentity Element: The element $[0]$ is the identity, since for any $[a] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, we have $[a] + [0] = [a+0] = [a]$ and $[0] + [a] = [0+a] = [a]$.\nInverse Element: For any $[a] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, the element $[-a]$ is its inverse, because $[a] + [-a] = [a+(-a)] = [0]$. Specifically, for $[0]$, the inverse is $[0]$; for $[1]$, the inverse is $[-1] = [2]$ (since $-1-2 = -3$); for $[2]$, the inverse is $[-2] = [1]$ (since $-2-1 = -3$). Every element has an inverse.\nCommutativity: For any $[a], [b] \\in \\mathbb{Z} / \\sim$, we have $[a] + [b] = [a+b]$. Since integer addition is commutative, $a+b = b+a$, so $[a+b] = [b+a]$. This equals $[b] + [a]$. Thus, the operation is commutative.\nSince all axioms are satisfied, $(\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +)$ is an Abelian group.\n\nFourth, for step 4, we identify the isomorphism class of this group. The group $G = (\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +)$ has order $|\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim| = 3$. Any group of prime order is cyclic. Let's check the element $[1]$. The powers of $[1]$ are $[1]^1 = [1]$, $[1]^2 = [1]+[1]=[2]$, and $[1]^3 = [1]+[1]+[1]=[3]=[0]$. Since $[1]$ generates all elements of the group, $G$ is a cyclic group of order $3$. A familiar example of a cyclic group of order $3$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}_3, +)$, the group of integers under addition modulo $3$. All cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic. A concrete isomorphism $\\phi: (\\mathbb{Z} / \\sim, +) \\to (\\mathbb{Z}_3, +)$ is the natural map $\\phi([a]) = a \\pmod 3$. This map is a homomorphism and a bijection, hence an isomorphism. The isomorphism class is that of the cyclic group of order $3$, denoted $C_3$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nFifth, for step 5, we determine the cardinality of the automorphism group $\\text{Aut}(G)$. An automorphism is an isomorphism from a group to itself. A fundamental property of homomorphisms, and thus automorphisms, is that they map generators to generators. The generators of a cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ are the elements $k$ such that $\\text{gcd}(k, n) = 1$. For our group $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3$, the elements are $\\{[0], [1], [2]\\}$. The generators are those elements $[k]$ where $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ since $\\text{gcd}(1, 3)=1$ and $\\text{gcd}(2, 3)=1$. Thus, the generators are $[1]$ and $[2]$.\nAn automorphism $f: G \\to G$ is completely determined by its action on a single generator, for instance $[1]$. The image $f([1])$ must be a generator of $G$. There are two choices for $f([1])$:\n1. $f_1([1]) = [1]$. This extends to the identity map: $f_1([x]) = [x]$ for all $[x] \\in G$.\n2. $f_2([1]) = [2]$. This extends to a non-trivial automorphism where $f_2([2]) = f_2([1]+[1]) = f_2([1])+f_2([1]) = [2]+[2] = [4] = [1]$, and $f_2([0]) = [0]$.\nSince there are two possible images for the generator $[1]$, there are exactly two automorphisms of $G$.\nThe number of automorphisms of a cyclic group of order $n$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$. For $n=3$, the number of automorphisms is $\\phi(3)$. Since $3$ is prime, $\\phi(3) = 3-1=2$. The cardinality of the automorphism group is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3050594"}]}
