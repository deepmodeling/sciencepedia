Since $\\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of $X$, every element $x \\in X$ belongs to exactly one block of $\\mathcal{P}$. It is therefore trivially in the same block as itself.

If $x \\, R \\, y$, it means $x$ and $y$ are in the same block of $\\mathcal{P}$. The statement \"$x$ and $y$ are in the same block\" is logically equivalent to \"$y$ and $x$ are in the same block\". This latter statement implies $y \\, R \\, x$. So, $R$ is symmetric.\n\n3.  **Transitivity:** For any $x, y, z \\in X$, we must show that if $x \\, R \\, y$ and $y \\, R \\, z$, then $x \\, R \\, z$.\n    - Assume $x \\, R \\, y$. This means there is a block $S_1 \\in \\mathcal{P}$ such that $x \\in S_1$ and $y \\in S_1$.\n    - Assume $y \\, R \\, z$. This means there is a block $S_2 \\in \\mathcal{P}$ such that $y \\in S_2$ and $z \\in S_2$.\n    - Since $y \\in S_1$ and $y \\in S_2$, the intersection $S_1 \\cap S_2$ is not empty.\n    - A fundamental property of a partition is that its blocks are pairwise disjoint. If two blocks have a non-empty intersection, they must be the same block. Therefore, $S_1 = S_2$.\n    - We have $x \\in S_1$ and $z \\in S_2$. Since $S_1 = S_2$, both $x$ and $z$ are in the same block.\n    - By definition of $R$, this means $x \\, R \\, z$.
