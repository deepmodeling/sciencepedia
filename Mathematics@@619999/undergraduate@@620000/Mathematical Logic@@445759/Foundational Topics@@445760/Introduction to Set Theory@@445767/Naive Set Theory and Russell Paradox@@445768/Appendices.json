All necessary definitions and conditions are provided, and it constitutes a standard, non-trivial exercise in elementary set theory.\n\nThe problem consists of three parts. The first part requires a proof of the existence and uniqueness of the complement of a set relative to a universal set $U$, using the provided principles. The second part involves a concrete calculation of a complement and its cardinality. The third part requires a conceptual explanation of Russell's paradox.\n\n**Part 1: Proof of the existence and uniqueness of the complement**\n\nWe are given a universal set $U$, the principle of set abstraction over a given set (restricted comprehension), and the axiom of extensionality.\n\nThe complement of a set $A$ relative to $U$ is defined as $C_{A} = \\{x \\in U : x \\notin A\\}$. This definition can be broken down. It describes a collection of elements $x$ that satisfy two conditions simultaneously: $x \\in U$ and $x \\notin A$.\n\nThe principle of set abstraction over $U$ states that for any property $\\varphi(x)$, the set $\\{x \\in U : \\varphi(x)\\}$ exists. To prove the existence of $C_A$, we must identify a suitable property $\\varphi(x)$.\n\nLet the property $\\varphi(x)$ be the predicate \"$x \\notin A$\". For any given set $A$, whether an object $x$ is an element of $A$ ($x \\in A$) or not ($x \\notin A$) is a well-defined question. Therefore, \"$x \\notin A$\" is a valid property.\n\nAccording to the principle of restricted comprehension, we can substitute this property $\\varphi(x)$ into the set-forming expression. This guarantees that the set $S = \\{x \\in U : x \\notin A\\}$ exists. By definition, this set $S$ is the complement of $A$ relative to $U$, so $C_A$ exists.\n\nTo prove that $C_A$ is unique, we use the axiom of extensionality, which states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. Let us assume there are two sets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, that both satisfy the definition of the complement of $A$ relative to $U$. Then, by definition:\n$S_1 = \\{x \\in U : x \\notin A\\}$\n$S_2 = \\{x \\in U : x \\notin A\\}$\n\nWe must show that $S_1 = S_2$. According to the axiom of extensionality, this requires showing that for any object $y$, $y \\in S_1$ if and only if $y \\in S_2$.\n\nLet $y$ be an arbitrary object.\nBy the definition of $S_1$, $y \\in S_1$ if and only if ($y \\in U$ and $y \\notin A$).\nBy the definition of $S_2$, $y \\in S_2$ if and only if ($y \\in U$ and $y \\notin A$).\n\nThe condition for membership in $S_1$ is identical to the condition for membership in $S_2$. Therefore, for any $y$, $y \\in S_1$ if and only if $y \\in S_2$. Since $S_1$ and $S_2$ have exactly the same elements, the axiom of extensionality implies that $S_1 = S_2$. This establishes the uniqueness of the complement $C_A$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the complement and its cardinality**\n\nWe are given the universal set $U$ and the set $A$:\n$$\nU = \\{\\, a,\\, b,\\, c,\\, \\{a\\},\\, \\{b\\},\\, \\{c\\},\\, \\{a,b\\},\\, \\{b,c\\},\\, \\{a,c\\},\\, \\{a,b,c\\} \\,\\}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\{\\, \\{a\\},\\, b,\\, \\{a,b\\},\\, \\{a,b,c\\},\\, c \\,\\}\n$$\nThe complement $C_A$ is the set of all elements that are in $U$ but not in $A$. We can write this as the set difference $C_A = U \\setminus A$. We determine the elements of $C_A$ by checking each element of $U$ for membership in $A$.\n\n1.  $a \\in U$. Is $a \\in A$? No. So, $a \\in C_A$.\n2.  $b \\in U$. Is $b \\in A$? Yes. So, $b \\notin C_A$.\n3.  $c \\in U$. Is $c \\in A$? Yes. So, $c \\notin C_A$.\n4.  $\\{a\\} \\in U$. Is $\\{a\\} \\in A$? Yes. So, $\\{a\\} \\notin C_A$.\n5.  $\\{b\\} \\in U$. Is $\\{b\\} \\in A$? No. So, $\\{b\\} \\in C_A$.\n6.  $\\{c\\} \\in U$. Is $\\{c\\} \\in A$? No. So, $\\{c\\} \\in C_A$.\n7.  $\\{a,b\\} \\in U$. Is $\\{a,b\\} \\in A$? Yes. So, $\\{a,b\\} \\notin C_A$.\n8.  $\\{b,c\\} \\in U$. Is $\\{b,c\\} \\in A$? No. So, $\\{b,c\\} \\in C_A$.\n9.  $\\{a,c\\} \\in U$. Is $\\{a,c\\} \\in A$?

So, $\\{a,b,c\\} \\notin C_A$.\n\nCollecting the elements that are in $U$ but not in $A$, we form the complement set:\n$$\nC_A = \\{\\, a,\\, \\{b\\},\\, \\{c\\},\\, \\{b,c\\},\\, \\{a,c\\} \\,\\}\n$$\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements it contains. By counting the elements in $C_A$, we find its cardinality:\n$$\n|C_{A}| = 5\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of the connection to Russell's Paradox**\n\nThe system described in the problem, with a predefined universal set $U$ and restricted comprehension, is consistent. However, the problem prompts an explanation for why a naive conception of set theory, with a \"set of all sets\" and unrestricted comprehension, leads to a contradiction.\n\nLet us posit that there exists a universal set $V$ which is the \"set of all sets\". Further, let us assume the principle of unrestricted comprehension, which asserts that for any property $\\varphi(x)$, the set $\\{x : \\varphi(x)\\}$ exists.\n\nConsider the property $\\varphi(x)$ defined as $x \\notin x$, which describes sets that are not members of themselves. This is a seemingly reasonable property; for instance, the set of all integers is not itself an integer.\n\nUsing unrestricted comprehension with this property, we can form the set $R$, known as the Russell set:\n$$\nR = \\{x : x \\notin x\\}\n$$\n$R$ is the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as members. Since we assumed $V$ is the set of all sets, $R$ must be a set, so either $R \\in V$ or not. More pointedly, we can ask the critical question: is $R$ a member of itself? That is, is $R \\in R$?\n\nThere are two logical possibilities, and both lead to a contradiction:\n\nCase 1: Assume $R \\in R$.\nIf $R$ is a member of itself, it must satisfy the defining property of the elements of $R$. The property is $x \\notin x$. Therefore, if $R \\in R$, it must be that $R \\notin R$. This is a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: Assume $R \\notin R$.\nIf $R$ is not a member of itself, it satisfies the property $x \\notin x$. The set $R$ is defined as the set of *all* sets that satisfy this property. Since $R$ satisfies the property, it must be an element of $R$. Therefore, if $R \\notin R$, it must be that $R \\in R$. This is also a contradiction.\n\nThe logical equivalence $(R \\in R) \\iff (R \\notin R)$ is a paradox, which demonstrates that the initial assumptions are inconsistent. The contradiction arises from the combination of unrestricted comprehension and the notion of a \"set of all sets\". Modern axiomatic set theories, such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), resolve this by imposing restrictions. Specifically, ZFC does not allow the formation of a \"set of all sets\" (it would be a proper class, not a set) and replaces unrestricted comprehension with a more limited Axiom Schema of Specification (or Separation). This axiom schema is a form of restricted comprehension, much like the one used in the first part of this problem, stating that we can only form subsets of already existing sets, which prevents the construction of the paradoxical set $R$.\nThe computation in Part 2 is safe from this paradox because it operates within a well-defined, finite universal set $U$, and comprehension is restricted to this set.\nThe final numerical answer from Part 2 remains unchanged.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3047292"}, {"introduction": "After the discovery of paradoxes, mathematicians needed a new, more rigorous foundation for set theory.

This requires us to check the condition $x \\notin x$ for each element $x \\in V_3$.\n\nIn standard axiomatic set theory (specifically, ZFC which includes the Axiom of Foundation/Regularity), it is a theorem that no set can be an element of itself, so $x \\notin x$ holds for all sets $x$. This staged construction of the cumulative hierarchy is designed to produce only such \"well-founded\" sets. For any set $x$ constructed in this hierarchy, its elements are always sets from a previous stage. If $x \\in V_{n+1}$, then any element $y \\in x$ must satisfy $y \\in V_n$. If we were to have $x \\in x$, this would imply $x \\in V_n$, contradicting the fact that $x$ is formed at stage $n+1$ (unless $x$ was also present at the earlier stage, but this still leads to a contradiction regarding the set's rank). Thus, the condition $x \\notin x$ will be true for every element of every $V_n$ in this hierarchy.\n\nLet's verify this explicitly for the elements of $V_3$:\n1.

Thus, $\\{\\emptyset\\} \\notin \\{\\emptyset\\}$ is true. So, $\\{\\emptyset\\} \\in R_3$.\n3. For $x = \\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$: The proposition $\\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\} \\in \\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$ is false because the only element of $\\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$ is $\\{\\emptyset\\}$, and $\\{\\emptyset\\} \\neq \\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$. Thus, $\\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\} \\notin \\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$ is true. So, $\\{\\{\\emptyset\\}\\} \\in R_3$.\n4. For $x = \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$: The proposition $\\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\} \\in \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$ is false because the elements of the set are $\\emptyset$ and $\\{\\emptyset\\}$, neither of which is the set $\\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$ itself. Thus, $\\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\} \\notin \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$ is true. So, $\\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\} \\in R_3$.\n\nSince the condition $x \\notin x$ is satisfied for all four elements $x \\in V_3$, the set $R_3$ is identical to $V_3$.\n$R_3 = V_3$.\nTherefore, its cardinality is $\\lvert R_3 \\rvert = \\lvert V_3 \\rvert = 4$.\n\nThe paradox is avoided because $R_3$ is a specific subset of $V_3$. By definition, $R_3$ is an element of the *next* stage, $V_4 = \\mathcal{P}(V_3)$. That is, $R_3 \\in V_4$. However, $R_3$ is not an element of $V_3$ (since $R_3=V_3$ and $V_3 \\notin V_3$). So the question that leads to Russell's paradox, whether $R_3 \\in R_3$, is answered in the negative: $R_3 \\notin R_3$ simply because $R_3 \\notin V_3$.
