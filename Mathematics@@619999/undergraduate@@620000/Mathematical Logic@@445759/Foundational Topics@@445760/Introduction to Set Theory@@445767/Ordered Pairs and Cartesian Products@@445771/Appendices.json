The analysis of each option may now proceed based on the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of the diagonal map $\\Delta: A \\to A \\times A$ defined by $\\Delta(a) = (a, a)$.\n\n**Injectivity of $\\Delta$**\nTo determine if $\\Delta$ is injective, we must check if the condition $\\Delta(a_1) = \\Delta(a_2)$ implies $a_1 = a_2$ for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$.\nLet $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ and suppose $\\Delta(a_1) = \\Delta(a_2)$.\nBy the definition of $\\Delta$, this means $(a_1, a_1) = (a_2, a_2)$.\nUsing the axiomatic property of ordered pairs, $(x, y) = (u, v)$ if and only if $x=u$ and $y=v$. Applying this here, we get $a_1 = a_2$ and $a_1 = a_2$.\nThe condition $a_1 = a_2$ is satisfied.\nThus, $\\Delta(a_1) = \\Delta(a_2)$ implies $a_1 = a_2$. This holds for any set $A$, including the empty set $A=\\varnothing$ (where the condition for injectivity is vacuously true).\nTherefore, the diagonal map $\\Delta$ is always injective.\n\n**Surjectivity of $\\Delta$**\nTo determine if $\\Delta$ is surjective, we must check if for every element $p \\in A \\times A$, there exists an element $a \\in A$ such that $\\Delta(a) = p$.\nThe codomain of $\\Delta$ is the set $A \\times A = \\{ (x, y) \\mid x \\in A, y \\in A \\}$.\nThe image of $\\Delta$ is the set $\\operatorname{Im}(\\Delta) = \\{ \\Delta(a) \\mid a \\in A \\} = \\{ (a, a) \\mid a \\in A \\}$.\nFor $\\Delta$ to be surjective, its image must equal its codomain, i.e., $\\operatorname{Im}(\\Delta) = A \\times A$.\nThis requires $\\{ (a, a) \\mid a \\in A \\} = \\{ (x, y) \\mid x \\in A, y \\in A \\}$.\nThis equality holds if and only if every element $(x, y) \\in A \\times A$ is of the form $(a, a)$, which means it must be the case that $x=y$. This implies that for any choice of two elements from $A$, they must be identical. This can only happen if the set $A$ has at most one element. Let's analyze the cases based on the cardinality of $A$, denoted $|A|$.\n- Case 1: $A = \\varnothing$. The domain is $\\varnothing$. The codomain is $A \\times A = \\varnothing \\times \\varnothing = \\varnothing$. A function into the empty set is surjective if and only if its domain is also empty. Since the domain is $\\varnothing$, the map $\\Delta: \\varnothing \\to \\varnothing$ is surjective. More formally, the condition \"for all $y \\in \\varnothing$, there exists $x \\in \\varnothing$...\" is vacuously true.\n- Case 2: $|A| = 1$. Let $A = \\{c\\}$ for some element $c$. The domain is $\\{c\\}$. The codomain is $A \\times A = \\{c\\} \\times \\{c\\} = \\{(c, c)\\}$. The map is $\\Delta(c) = (c, c)$. The image $\\operatorname{Im}(\\Delta) = \\{(c,c)\\}$ is equal to the codomain $A \\times A$. Thus, $\\Delta$ is surjective.\n- Case 3: $|A| \\ge 2$. Let $x, y \\in A$ such that $x \\neq y$. The element $(x, y)$ is in the codomain $A \\times A$. For $\\Delta$ to be surjective, there must exist an element $a \\in A$ such that $\\Delta(a) = (x, y)$. This would mean $(a, a) = (x, y)$. By the property of ordered pairs, this implies $a=x$ and $a=y$, which means $x=y$. This contradicts our assumption that $x \\neq y$. Therefore, the element $(x, y)$ is not in the image of $\\Delta$. Since the image is not equal to the codomain, $\\Delta$ is not surjective.\n\nIn summary, $\\Delta$ is surjective if and only if $|A| \\le 1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The map $\\Delta$ is injective for every set $A$.**\nAs derived above, for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, the statement $\\Delta(a_1) = \\Delta(a_2)$ implies $(a_1, a_1) = (a_2, a_2)$, which by the axiom of ordered pairs implies $a_1=a_2$. This satisfies the definition of an injective function for any set $A$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $A\\neq\\varnothing$, then $\\Delta$ is surjective if and only if $A$ has exactly $1$ element.**\nThis is a biconditional statement, which we must check in both directions, under the condition $A\\neq\\varnothing$.\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $\\Delta$ is surjective. We need to show that $A$ has exactly $1$ element. Since $\\Delta$ is surjective, for any pair $(x, y) \\in A \\times A$, there exists an $a \\in A$ such that $\\Delta(a) = (a,a) = (x,y)$. This implies $x=a$ and $y=a$, so $x=y$. This means that any two elements in $A$ must be equal. Since $A \\neq \\varnothing$, $A$ must contain at least one element. If it contained more than one, they would not all be equal, which is a contradiction. Thus, $A$ must contain exactly one element.\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $A$ has exactly $1$ element, say $A=\\{c\\}$. The codomain is $A \\times A = \\{(c,c)\\}$. The only element in the codomain is $(c,c)$. Since $c \\in A$, we can compute $\\Delta(c) = (c,c)$. Thus, there exists an element in the domain ($c$) that maps to the element in the codomain ($(c,c)$). Therefore, $\\Delta$ is surjective.\nBoth directions of the biconditional are true.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $A=\\varnothing$, then $\\Delta$ is surjective.**\nAs shown in our general analysis of surjectivity, if $A = \\varnothing$, the domain of $\\Delta$ is $\\varnothing$ and the codomain is $A \\times A = \\varnothing \\times \\varnothing = \\varnothing$. The definition of a function $f:X \\to Y$ being surjective is that for every $y \\in Y$, there is an $x \\in X$ with $f(x)=y$. When $Y=\\varnothing$, this condition is vacuously true because there are no elements $y$ in $Y$ for which the condition must be checked. Thus, $\\Delta: \\varnothing \\to \\varnothing$ is surjective.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. For any set $A$ with at least two distinct elements $x\\neq y$, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ lies in $\\operatorname{Im}(\\Delta)$.**\nThe image of $\\Delta$ is $\\operatorname{Im}(\\Delta) = \\{ (a, a) \\mid a \\in A \\}$. By definition, every element in the image of $\\Delta$ is an ordered pair whose first and second components are identical. The statement considers an ordered pair $(x, y)$ where $x \\neq y$. Such a pair cannot be of the form $(a, a)$, because that would imply $x=y$. Therefore, the pair $(x, y)$ with $x \\neq y$ cannot lie in $\\operatorname{Im}(\\Delta)$. The statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If $A$ is a singleton, then $\\Delta$ is bijective with inverse given by the projection $\\pi_{1}:A\\times A\\to A$, $\\pi_{1}(x,y)=x$.**\nLet $A$ be a singleton set, so $A = \\{c\\}$ for some $c$.\nThe map is $\\Delta: \\{c\\} \\to \\{(c,c)\\}$.\n1.  **Bijectivity of $\\Delta$**:\n    - From (A), $\\Delta$ is injective for any set, so it is injective for a singleton.\n    - From (B), if $A$ has exactly $1$ element, $\\Delta$ is surjective.\n    - Since $\\Delta$ is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.\n2.  **Inverse map**: A bijective function has a unique inverse. Let's check if the given projection map $\\pi_1$ is the inverse of $\\Delta$.\n    The domain of $\\pi_1$ is $A \\times A = \\{(c, c)\\}$ and its codomain is $A = \\{c\\}$. The definition gives $\\pi_1((x,y)) = x$, so $\\pi_1((c,c))=c$.\n    To be the inverse, two compositions must yield identity maps:\n    - $\\pi_1 \\circ \\Delta$ must be the identity map on $A$, $\\operatorname{id}_A$. Let's test for the only element $c \\in A$:\n      $(\\pi_1 \\circ \\Delta)(c) = \\pi_1(\\Delta(c)) = \\pi_1((c,c)) = c$.\n      Since $\\operatorname{id}_A(c) = c$, this composition is correct.\n    - $\\Delta \\circ \\pi_1$ must be the identity map on $A \\times A$, $\\operatorname{id}_{A \\times A}$. Let's test for the only element $(c,c) \\in A \\times A$:\n      $(\\Delta \\circ \\pi_1)((c,c)) = \\Delta(\\pi_1((c,c))) = \\Delta(c) = (c,c)$.\n      Since $\\operatorname{id}_{A \\times A}((c,c)) = (c,c)$, this composition is also correct.\nBecause both compositions yield the appropriate identity maps, $\\pi_1$ is indeed the inverse of $\\Delta$ when $A$ is a singleton.

For any function $x \\in A^n$, the image $T_{\\sigma}(x)$ must also be a function from $[n]$ to $A$. A natural way to define this is through function composition. The permutation $\\sigma$ acts on the domain $[n]$ of the functions in $A^n$. A \"permutation of coordinates\" can be formalized by pre-composing the function $x$ with the inverse of the permutation $\\sigma$.\n\nLet $x \\in A^n$ and $\\sigma \\in S_n$.

For any $x \\in A^n$:\n$$(T_{\\sigma^{-1}} \\circ T_{\\sigma})(x) = T_{\\sigma^{-1}}(T_{\\sigma}(x))$$\nBy definition of $T_{\\sigma}$, we have $T_{\\sigma}(x) = x \\circ \\sigma^{-1}$.
