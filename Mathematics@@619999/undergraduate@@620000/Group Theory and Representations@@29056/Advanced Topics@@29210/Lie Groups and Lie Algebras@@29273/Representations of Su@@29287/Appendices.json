For any element $h \\in H$, its inverse $h^{-1}$ is also in $H$ (closure under inversion).\n\nFirst, let's characterize the general form of a matrix in $H$. Let $M$ be a diagonal 2x2 matrix:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $M$ to be in SU(2), it must satisfy two conditions: it must be unitary and its determinant must be 1.\n\nCondition 1: Unitarity ($M^\\dagger M = I$)\nThe conjugate transpose of $M$ is $M^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} a^* & 0 \\\\ 0 & d^* \\end{pmatrix}$, where $a^*$ and $d^*$ are the complex conjugates of $a$ and $d$.\nThe product $M^\\dagger M$ is:\n$$\nM^\\dagger M = \\begin{pmatrix} a^* & 0 \\\\ 0 & d^* \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^*a & 0 \\\\ 0 & d^*d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} |a|^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & |d|^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor this to equal the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, we must have $|a|^2 = 1$ and $|d|^2 = 1$. This implies that $a$ and $d$ are complex numbers of modulus 1. Such numbers can be written in the form $a = \\exp(i\\alpha)$ and $d = \\exp(i\\delta)$ for some real numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$.\n\nCondition 2: Determinant is 1 ($\\det(M) = 1$)\nThe determinant of $M$ is $\\det(M) = ad$.\nUsing the forms from the unitary condition, we have:\n$$\n\\det(M) = \\exp(i\\alpha) \\exp(i\\delta) = \\exp(i(\\alpha+\\delta)) = 1\n$$\nThis requires $\\alpha + \\delta = 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.

The set $H$ is the collection of all such matrices.\n\nNow we can apply the subgroup test to $H$.\n\n1.  **Identity Element:** Is the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ in $H$?\n    We need to find if there is a $\\theta$ such that $M(\\theta) = I$.

Since $\\theta_1+\\theta_2$ is a real number, this matrix is also an element of $H$. Therefore, $H$ is closed under multiplication. This eliminates option A.\n\n3.  **Closure under Inversion:** Let $M(\\theta)$ be an arbitrary element of $H$. Is its inverse, $(M(\\theta))^{-1}$, also in $H$?\n    For a unitary matrix, the inverse is equal to the conjugate transpose: $(M(\\theta))^{-1} = (M(\\theta))^\\dagger$.\n    $$\n    (M(\\theta))^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\exp(i\\theta))^* & 0 \\\\ 0 & (\\exp(-i\\theta))^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-i\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(i\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    To see if this matrix is in the standard form for elements of $H$, we can rewrite the second diagonal element: $\\exp(i\\theta) = \\exp(-(-i\\theta))$. So the matrix is:\n    $$\n    (M(\\theta))^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(i(-\\theta)) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(-i(-\\theta)) \\end{pmatrix} = M(-\\theta)\n    $$\n    Since $-\\theta$ is a real number if $\\theta$ is, the inverse $M(-\\theta)$ is an element of $H$. Therefore, $H$ is closed under inversion.
