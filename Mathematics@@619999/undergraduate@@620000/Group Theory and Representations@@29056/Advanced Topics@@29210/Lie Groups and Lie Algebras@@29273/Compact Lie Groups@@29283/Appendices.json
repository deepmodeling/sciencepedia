We begin with the circle group, $U(1)$, which is perhaps the most essential example of a compact Lie group. This first practice invites you to apply the formal definition of a subgroup to various subsets of $U(1)$, testing your ability to verify the group axioms and identify valid substructures within this foundational group.

A non-empty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup if and only if for any two elements $a, b \\in H$, the element $ab^{-1}$ is also in $H$. For finite sets, this is equivalent to checking that the set is non-empty and closed under the group operation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. $S_A = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid z^5 = 1 \\}$**\nThis set is the set of the 5th roots of unity.\n1.  **Non-empty**: The identity element of $U(1)$ is $1$. Since $1^5 = 1$, $1 \\in S_A$. Thus, the set is non-empty.\n2.  **Closure and Inverses**: Let's use the one-step subgroup test. Let $a, b \\in S_A$. By definition, $a^5 = 1$ and $b^5 = 1$. The inverse of $b$ in $U(1)$ is $b^{-1} = 1/b$. We need to check if $ab^{-1} \\in S_A$. We can compute $(ab^{-1})^5$.\n$$ (ab^{-1})^5 = a^5 (b^{-1})^5 = a^5 (b^5)^{-1} $$\nSubstituting $a^5=1$ and $b^5=1$, we get:\n$$ (ab^{-1})^5 = 1 \\cdot (1)^{-1} = 1 $$\nThis shows that $ab^{-1}$ is also a 5th root of unity, so $ab^{-1} \\in S_A$.\nSince $S_A$ is non-empty and closed under multiplication by an inverse, it is a subgroup of $U(1)$.\n\n**B. $S_B = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid z^4 = 1 \\text{ or } z^6 = 1 \\}$**\nThis set is the union of the 4th roots of unity and the 6th roots of unity.

Similarly, $b \\in S_D$.\nTheir product is $ab = \\exp(i\\pi)\\exp(i\\pi) = \\exp(i2\\pi) = 1$. The complex number $1$ can be written as $\\exp(i0)$, and $\\theta=0$ is in $[0, 3\\pi/2]$.

Since $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ is in $[0, 3\\pi/2]$, $b \\in S_D$.\nNow, consider their product $c=ab$:\n$$ c = \\exp(i\\pi) \\exp(i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = \\exp\\left(i\\left(\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right) = \\exp(i\\frac{7\\pi}{4}) $$\nFor $c$ to be in $S_D$, its argument (when chosen in $[0, 2\\pi)$) must be in the interval $[0, 3\\pi/2]$. The argument is $\\theta = 7\\pi/4$.\nWe compare $7\\pi/4$ with $3\\pi/2$. Since $\\frac{7}{4} = 1.75$ and $\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$, we have $\\frac{7\\pi}{4} > \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nThe argument of the product $c$ is outside the allowed range. Thus, $c \\notin S_D$.
