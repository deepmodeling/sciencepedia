A fundamental theorem in group theory states that every subgroup of an abelian group is a normal subgroup. To see this, let $H$ be any subgroup of an abelian group $G$. For any $h \\in H$ and any $g \\in G$, the conjugate of $h$ by $g$ is $ghg^{-1}$. Since $G$ is abelian, we can rearrange the terms: $ghg^{-1} = gg^{-1}h = eh = h$. Since $h \\in H$, this shows that $H$ is closed under conjugation by any element of $G$, which is the definition of a normal subgroup.\n\nSince every subgroup of $V_4$ is normal, the condition of finding the \"smallest normal subgroup containing $S$\" simplifies to finding the \"smallest subgroup containing $S$\".\n\nThe smallest subgroup of a group $G$ that contains a subset $S$ is, by definition, the subgroup generated by $S$, denoted $\\langle S \\rangle$. In our case, $S = \\{x\\}$, so we need to find the subgroup generated by the single element $x$, which is $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nThe subgroup generated by a single element $x$ is the set of all integer powers of $x$: $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that for any non-identity element $x \\in V_4$, its order is 2. This means $x^2 = e$, where $e$ is the identity element. Also note that $x^0=e$ and $x^1=x$. For any higher power, we can reduce it. For example, $x^3 = x^2 \\cdot x = e \\cdot x = x$. For negative powers, $x^{-1} = x$ since $x^2=e$. Thus, the only distinct elements in the set of powers of $x$ are $e$ and $x$.\n\nTherefore, the subgroup generated by $x$ is $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{e, x\\}$.\n\nThis subgroup has two distinct elements, so its order is 2. Let's analyze its properties.\nA group of order 2 is generated by its non-identity element. The non-identity element is $x$, and the group is $\\{x^1, x^2=e\\}$. This is the definition of a cyclic group. Hence, $\\{e, x\\}$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n\nThis result holds for any choice of the non-identity element $x$.\n- If $x=a$, the normal closure is $\\langle a \\rangle = \\{e, a\\}$.\n- If $x=b$, the normal closure is $\\langle b \\rangle = \\{e, b\\}$.\n- If $x=c$, the normal closure is $\\langle c \\rangle = \\{e, c\\}$.\n\nIn every case, the resulting subgroup is a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. The entire group $V_4$. This is a normal subgroup containing $\\{x\\}$, but it is not the smallest one, as $\\{e, x\\}$ is a smaller normal subgroup. So, A is incorrect.\nB.

To find the elements of this subgroup, we must include the identity element and all possible products of the generators and their inverses. The generators are $j$ and $-j$. The inverse of $j$ is $j^{-1}=-j$, and the inverse of $-j$ is $(-j)^{-1} = j$, so the set of generators is closed under taking inverses.\n\nLet's build the subgroup:\n- The identity element, $1$, must be in the subgroup.
