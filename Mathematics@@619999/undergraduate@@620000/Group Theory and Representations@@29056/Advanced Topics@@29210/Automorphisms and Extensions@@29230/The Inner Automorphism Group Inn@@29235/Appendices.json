Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\text{Inn}(G) \\cong G/Z(G) $$\nThe center of a group $G$, denoted $Z(G)$, is the set of elements that commute with every element in $G$: $Z(G) = \\{z \\in G \\mid zg = gz \\text{ for all } g \\in G\\}$.\n\nUsing this isomorphism, the conditions on $G$ can be rephrased:\n1.  $G$ is non-abelian: This means that $G$ is not equal to its center, $Z(G) \\neq G$.\n2.  $\\text{Inn}(G)$ is abelian: This is equivalent to the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ being abelian.\n\nA group of the form $G/N$ is abelian if and only if for any two cosets $aN$ and $bN$, we have $(aN)(bN) = (bN)(aN)$, which simplifies to $aba^{-1}b^{-1} \\in N$. The element $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ is the commutator of $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $G/Z(G)$ is abelian if and only if all commutators of $G$ lie within the center $Z(G)$.\n\nWe will now examine each option:\n\nA. The symmetric group $S_3$:\n$S_3$ is the group of permutations of 3 elements and has order 6. It is non-abelian; for example, $(12)(13) = (132)$ while $(13)(12) = (123)$.\nThe center of $S_3$ is the trivial group, $Z(S_3) = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity permutation.\nUsing the isomorphism, $\\text{Inn}(S_3) \\cong S_3 / Z(S_3) \\cong S_3 / \\{e\\} \\cong S_3$.\nSince $S_3$ is non-abelian, $\\text{Inn}(S_3)$ is also non-abelian. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\nB. The cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_8$:\nThis group is cyclic, and all cyclic groups are abelian. The problem requires the group $G$ to be non-abelian. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\nC. The quaternion group $Q_8$:\nThe group is $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n1.  Is $Q_8$ non-abelian? Yes. For example, $ij=k$ but $ji=-k$. So $ij \\neq ji$.\n2.  Is $\\text{Inn}(Q_8)$ abelian? We first find the center, $Z(Q_8)$. The elements $\\pm 1$ commute with all elements. Let's check $i$: $ij=k$ and $ji=-k$, so $i$ does not commute with $j$. Similarly, $j$ does not commute with $k$, and $k$ does not commute with $i$. Therefore, the center is $Z(Q_8) = \\{1, -1\\}$.\nNow we consider the quotient group $G/Z(G) = Q_8 / \\{\\pm 1\\}$. The order of this group is $|Q_8| / |Z(Q_8)| = 8 / 2 = 4$.\nAny group of order 4 is abelian (it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ or the Klein four-group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$).\nSince $Q_8/Z(Q_8)$ is abelian, it follows that $\\text{Inn}(Q_8)$ is abelian.\nBoth conditions are met. Thus, option C is a correct answer.\n\nD. The dihedral group $D_4$:\n$D_4$ is the group of symmetries of a square, with order 8. We can represent it with generators $r$ (rotation by 90 degrees) and $s$ (a reflection) satisfying $r^4=s^2=1$ and $sr=r^{-1}s=r^3s$.\n1.  Is $D_4$ non-abelian? Yes. Since $sr = r^3s$ and $r \\neq r^3$, we have $sr \\neq rs$.\n2.  Is $\\text{Inn}(D_4)$ abelian? We find the center, $Z(D_4)$. An element is in the center if it commutes with both generators $r$ and $s$. The elements of $D_4$ are $\\{e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$. A direct check shows that only the identity $e$ and the 180-degree rotation $r^2$ commute with all other elements. For example, $r(r^2)=r^3$ and $(r^2)r=r^3$; $s(r^2)=(sr)r=(r^3s)r=r^3(sr)=r^3(r^3s)=r^6s=r^2s$, and $(r^2)s=r^2s$. So $Z(D_4) = \\{e, r^2\\}$.\nNow we consider the quotient group $G/Z(G) = D_4 / \\{e, r^2\\}$. The order of this group is $|D_4| / |Z(D_4)| = 8 / 2 = 4$.\nAs with the quaternions, any group of order 4 is abelian. Therefore, $\\text{Inn}(D_4)$ is abelian.\nBoth conditions are met. Thus, option D is a correct answer.\n\nE. The symmetric group $S_4$:\n$S_4$ is the group of permutations of 4 elements and has order 24.\nIt is non-abelian. The center of $S_n$ for $n \\ge 3$ is trivial, so $Z(S_4) = \\{e\\}$.\nThus, $\\text{Inn}(S_4) \\cong S_4 / Z(S_4) \\cong S_4 / \\{e\\} \\cong S_4$.\nSince $S_4$ is non-abelian, $\\text{Inn}(S_4)$ is also non-abelian.
