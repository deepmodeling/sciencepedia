You will discover that an automorphism's behavior is often entirely determined by its action on a small set of the group's generators. Working with the quaternion group $Q_8$ and its defining relations, this problem provides hands-on practice in leveraging a group's internal structure to deduce the complete action of an automorphism from limited information [@problem_id:1645617].", "problem": "The quaternion group, denoted $Q_8$, is a set of eight elements given by $Q_8 = \\{1, -1, i, j, k, -i, -j, -k\\}$.

Consider a specific automorphism $\\phi: Q_8 \\to Q_8$ that is known to map the element $i$ to $k$ and the element $k$ to $-j$. That is, we are given that $\\phi(i) = k$ and $\\phi(k) = -j$.\n\nYour task is to determine the image of the element $j$ under this automorphism. Find the element in $Q_8$ that is equal to $\\phi(j)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the image of the element $j$ under a given automorphism $\\phi: Q_8 \\to Q_8$, where we are provided with the images of two other elements, $\\phi(i) = k$ and $\\phi(k) = -j$.\n\nAn automorphism is a homomorphism, which means it must preserve the group operation. For any two elements $a, b \\in Q_8$, the property $\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a)\\phi(b)$ must hold. We can use this property along with the defining relations of the quaternion group to find $\\phi(j)$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the relation $ij = k$. Let's apply the automorphism $\\phi$ to both sides of this equation:\n$$\\phi(ij) = \\phi(k)$$\nUsing the homomorphism property on the left side, we get:\n$$\\phi(i)\\phi(j) = \\phi(k)$$\nNow, we can substitute the given information into this equation.

To do this, we need to \"divide\" by $k$ on the left, which is equivalent to left-multiplying by the inverse of $k$, denoted $k^{-1}$.\n\nTo find the inverse of $k$, we use the relation $k^2 = -1$. Multiplying this equation by $-1$, we get $-k^2 = 1$. We can rewrite the left side as $(-k)k = 1$. By the definition of an inverse, this shows that the inverse of $k$ is $-k$.

Since $-1$ commutes with all elements, we can write this as $(-1)k(-1)j = (-1)(-1)kj = (1)kj = kj$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$\\phi(j) = kj$$\nFinally, we use another of the defining relations of $Q_8$ provided in the problem statement: $kj = -i$.\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n$$\\phi(j) = -i$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-i}$$", "id": "1645617"}]}
