Since a non-abelian simple group is not solvable, any order involving at most two primes is excluded. Therefore:\n- $77=7\\cdot 11$ involves two primes, hence any group of order $77$ is solvable, so not non-abelian simple.\n- $125=5^{3}$ is a $p$-group; any nontrivial $p$-group has nontrivial center and is not simple unless of prime order. Thus not non-abelian simple.\n- $200=2^{3}\\cdot 5^{2}$ involves two primes, hence solvable, not non-abelian simple.\n\nThe order $60=2^{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 5$ does not fall under Burnside's two-prime case, and indeed the alternating group $A_{5}$ is a non-abelian simple group of order $60$. Thus $60$ is a valid order.\n\nIt remains to check $132=2^{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. We show that no simple group of this order exists using Sylow theory.\n\nLet $G$ be a simple group of order $|G|=132=2^{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. Consider Sylow $11$-subgroups. By Sylow,\n$$\nn_{11}\\mid \\frac{132}{11}=12,\\quad n_{11}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}.\n$$\nHence $n_{11}\\in\\{1,12\\}$, and simplicity forces $n_{11}=12$. Each Sylow $11$-subgroup is cyclic of order $11$, contributing $10$ elements of order $11$, and distinct Sylow $11$-subgroups intersect trivially. Therefore the number of elements of order $11$ is\n$$\n12\\cdot 10=120.\n$$\nThus $132-120=12$ elements remain to account for the identity and all non-$11$-elements.\n\nNow consider Sylow $3$-subgroups. By Sylow,\n$$\nn_{3}\\mid \\frac{132}{3}=44,\\quad n_{3}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3},\n$$\nso $n_{3}\\in\\{1,4,22\\}$. Simplicity excludes $n_{3}=1$. If $n_{3}=22$, then there would be $22\\cdot 2=44$ elements of order $3$, impossible since only $12$ elements remain after counting order $11$. Hence $n_{3}=4$, giving $4\\cdot 2=8$ elements of order $3$. After accounting for these, the number of remaining elements is\n$$\n12-8=4,\n$$\nwhich includes the identity, so only $3$ nonidentity elements remain to account for all elements of orders involving the prime $2$ (and any potential mixed orders such as $6,22,33$).\n\nConsider Sylow $2$-subgroups, which have order $4$. If there are at least two distinct Sylow $2$-subgroups, then the total number of nonidentity $2$-elements is at least $5$: each subgroup contributes $3$ nonidentity elements, and two distinct subgroups of order $4$ intersect in a subgroup of order at most $2$, so the union contains at least $3+3-1=5$ distinct nonidentity elements. However, there are only $3$ nonidentity elements left unaccounted for, a contradiction. Therefore there is exactly one Sylow $2$-subgroup, which would then be normal, contradicting the simplicity of $G$. Hence no simple group of order $132$ exists.\n\nCombining these conclusions, the only listed order that can be the order of a non-abelian simple group is $60$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1601821"}]}
