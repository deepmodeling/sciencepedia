We will solve this using character theory. The main steps are to determine the character of the representation $\\pi|_H$ and then to use the character inner product to find the multiplicities of the irreducible representations of $H$ in this decomposition.\n\nFirst, let's determine how the generator $r$ of $H$ acts on the two diagonals of the square, $d_1$ and $d_2$. Let the vertices of the square be at coordinates $(1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1)$.

After rotation, these vertices map to $(-1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$ respectively. These are the vertices connected by diagonal $d_2$. So, $r(d_1) = d_2$.\nThe diagonal $d_2$ connects vertices $(-1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$. After rotation, these vertices map to $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,1)$ respectively. These are the vertices connected by diagonal $d_1$. So, $r(d_2) = d_1$.\n\nThe action of $r$ permutes the two diagonals. The representation $(\\pi, V)$ is defined on a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ corresponding to $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$. From the action, we have $\\pi(r)v_1 = v_2$ and $\\pi(r)v_2 = v_1$. In matrix form, with respect to this basis, the linear map $\\pi(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\pi(r) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow we need the matrices for all elements in the subgroup $H = \\{e, r, r^2, r^3\\}$.
