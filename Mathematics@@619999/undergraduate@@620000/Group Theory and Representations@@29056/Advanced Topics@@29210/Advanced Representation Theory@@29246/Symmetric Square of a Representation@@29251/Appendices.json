We are asked to find the character of the symmetric square representation, $S^2(V)$, which we denote as $\\chi_{S^2(V)}$.\n\nThe character of the symmetric square of a representation is related to the character of the original representation by the formula:\n$$ \\chi_{S^2(V)}(h) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\chi_V(h))^2 + \\chi_V(h^2) \\right] $$\nTo use this formula, we must first compute the character $\\chi_V$ for all elements of the group $C_3 = \\{e, g, g^2\\}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the matrices representing the group elements in the standard basis $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$.\n1.  **Identity element $e$**: The identity element acts as the identity transformation. $e \\cdot v_i = v_i$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. The matrix representation $\\rho(e)$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix:\n    $$ \\rho(e) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The character is the trace of this matrix: $\\chi_V(e) = \\text{Tr}(\\rho(e)) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, $g^2 \\cdot v_2 = v_1$ and $g^2 \\cdot v_3 = v_2$. The matrix representation $\\rho(g^2)$ is:\n    $$ \\rho(g^2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    This is also equal to $\\rho(g)^2$. The character is the trace of this matrix: $\\chi_V(g^2) = \\text{Tr}(\\rho(g^2)) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nSo, the character of the representation on $V$ is given by the values $(\\chi_V(e), \\chi_V(g), \\chi_V(g^2)) = (3, 0, 0)$.\n\nNow we can compute the character $\\chi_{S^2(V)}$ for each group element using the formula.\n\n1.  **For $h=e$**: We have $h^2 = e^2 = e$.\n    $$ \\chi_{S^2(V)}(e) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\chi_V(e))^2 + \\chi_V(e^2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (3)^2 + \\chi_V(e) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} [9 + 3] = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 $$\n    The dimension of $S^2(V)$ for $V=\\mathbb{C}^3$ is $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = 6$, so this value is correct.\n\n2.  **For $h=g$**: We have $h^2 = g^2$.\n    $$ \\chi_{S^2(V)}(g) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\chi_V(g))^2 + \\chi_V(g^2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0)^2 + 0 \\right] = 0 $$\n\n3.  **For $h=g^2$**: We have $h^2 = (g^2)^2 = g^4 = g^3 \\cdot g = e \\cdot g = g$.\n    $$ \\chi_{S^2(V)}(g^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\chi_V(g^2))^2 + \\chi_V((g^2)^2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\chi_V(g^2))^2 + \\chi_V(g) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} [0^2 + 0] = 0 $$\n\nTherefore, the character of the symmetric square representation is given by the ordered triple $(\\chi_{S^2(V)}(e), \\chi_{S^2(V)}(g), \\chi_{S^2(V)}(g^2)) = (6, 0, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1643944"}, {"introduction": "Moving from calculation to conceptual understanding, we now ask a critical question: are desirable properties of a representation, such as faithfulness, automatically inherited by its constructions?
