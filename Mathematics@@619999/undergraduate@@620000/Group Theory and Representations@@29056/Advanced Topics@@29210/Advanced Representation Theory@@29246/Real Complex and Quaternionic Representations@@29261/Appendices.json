The one-dimensional irreducible complex representations of $C_n$ can be indexed by integers $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.

Substituting this into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\nu(\\chi_k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\chi_k((g^j)^2) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\chi_k(g^{2j}) $$\nNext, we use the definition of the character $\\chi_k(g^m) = \\exp(2\\pi i k m / n)$. Applying this to our expression gives:\n$$ \\nu(\\chi_k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i k (2j)}{n}\\right) $$\nWe can rewrite the term inside the summation to identify it as a geometric series:\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i k j}{n}\\right) = \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\pi i k}{n}\\right)\\right]^j $$\nLet the common ratio of this geometric series be $r = \\exp(4\\pi i k / n)$. The sum becomes $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} r^j$. We analyze this sum by considering two cases for the ratio $r$.\n\nCase 1: $r = 1$.\nThe ratio $r$ is equal to 1 if its exponent is an integer multiple of $2\\pi i$. That is,\n$$ \\frac{4\\pi i k}{n} = 2\\pi i m $$\nfor some integer $m$. Simplifying this condition, we get $2k = mn$, which means that $2k$ must be a multiple of $n$.\nWhen $r=1$, every term in the sum is $1^j=1$, so the sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 1 = n $$\nIn this case, the Frobenius-Schur indicator is:\n$$ \\nu(\\chi_k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot n = 1 $$\n\nCase 2: $r \\neq 1$.\nThis case occurs if $2k$ is not a multiple of $n$. For a finite geometric series with $r \\neq 1$, the sum is given by the formula $\\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}$.

As we are in the case where $r \\neq 1$, the denominator is non-zero. Therefore, the sum is 0.\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} r^j = 0 $$\nIn this case, the Frobenius-Schur indicator is:\n$$ \\nu(\\chi_k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n\nTo summarize, we have found that $\\nu(\\chi_k)=1$ if $2k$ is a multiple of $n$, and $\\nu(\\chi_k)=0$ otherwise. Now we analyze the condition \"$2k$ is a multiple of $n$\" for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\n- For $k=0$: $2(0)=0$, which is a multiple of any integer $n$. Thus, $\\nu(\\chi_0)=1$. This corresponds to the trivial representation.\n\n- For $k>0$: We consider two sub-cases based on the parity of $n$.\n  - If $n$ is odd: Since $\\gcd(2, n)=1$, for $n$ to divide $2k$, it must be that $n$ divides $k$. However, since $k$ is in the range $1 \\le k \\le n-1$, $k$ cannot be a multiple of $n$. Therefore, for odd $n$, the condition is only met for $k=0$.\n\n  - If $n$ is even: Let $n=2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$. The condition becomes that $2m$ must divide $2k$, which simplifies to $m$ must divide $k$. In other words, $k$ must be a multiple of $n/2$. In the range $0 \\le k \\le n-1$, the multiples of $n/2$ are $k=0$ and $k=n/2$. We have already confirmed $k=0$. The other value is $k=n/2$. For this value, $2k = 2(n/2) = n$, which is a multiple of $n$. So, if $n$ is even, $\\nu(\\chi_{n/2})=1$.\n\nCombining all these findings:\n- $\\nu(\\chi_k) = 1$ if $k=0$ (for any $n$).\n- $\\nu(\\chi_k) = 1$ if $n$ is even and $k=n/2$.\n- $\\nu(\\chi_k) = 0$ for all other values of $k$.\n- The indicator is never $-1$.\n\nThis result matches the statement in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1637532"}, {"introduction": "A common question is whether a representation with a real-valued (or even integer-valued) character must be of real type.
