This final practice challenges you to apply your skills to a more complex coordination compound, the tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) ion, $[\\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$. Analyzing the symmetry of its unique, propeller-like structure will not only test your ability to identify elements in a chiral molecule but also demonstrate how point group determination directly predicts whether a molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, a property known as chirality [@problem_id:1635456].", "problem": "Consider the coordination complex tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III), which has the chemical formula $[\\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$. In this complex, the central cobalt(III) ion is coordinated to three ligands of ethylenediamine, abbreviated as 'en'. Ethylenediamine ($H_2N-CH_2-CH_2-NH_2$) is a bidentate ligand, meaning it binds to the central metal ion using the lone pairs on both of its nitrogen atoms. This chelation creates a stable five-membered ring structure ($Co-N-C-C-N$). Due to steric constraints, this ring is not planar but adopts a puckered 'gauche' conformation. The three ethylenediamine ligands arrange themselves around the central $Co^{3+}$ ion in a three-dimensional, propeller-like fashion.\n\nBased on this structural description, determine the point group of the $[\\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$ complex and use this to conclude whether the molecule is chiral or achiral.

We will systematically identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule based on its described structure.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the overall structure and identify the principal axis of rotation.\nThe complex has a central cobalt atom with three identical bidentate ethylenediamine (en) ligands. These ligands are described as being arranged in a \"propeller-like\" fashion. This immediately suggests a principal axis of rotation passing through the center of the propeller. Indeed, there is a three-fold rotation axis, $C_3$, that passes through the cobalt ion. Rotating the molecule by $360^{\\circ}/3 = 120^{\\circ}$ around this axis leaves the molecule's appearance unchanged, as it permutes the positions of the three identical 'en' ligands.\n\nStep 2: Look for other symmetry elements, starting with perpendicular $C_2$ axes.\nA molecule in a $D_n$ point group possesses $n$ two-fold rotation axes ($C_2$) perpendicular to the principal $C_n$ axis. In the case of $[\\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$, there are three such $C_2$ axes. Each $C_2$ axis passes through the central cobalt atom and bisects one of the puckered $Co-N-C-C-N$ rings, passing through the midpoint of the C-C bond of that ligand. A $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about one of these axes will interchange the two other 'en' ligands while mapping the bisected ligand back onto itself. Since there is a $C_3$ axis and three perpendicular $C_2$ axes, the molecule belongs to the $D_3$ family of point groups.\n\nStep 3: Distinguish among $D_3$, $D_{3h}$, and $D_{3d}$.\nTo do this, we check for additional symmetry elements, such as a horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$), dihedral mirror planes ($\\sigma_d$), or an improper rotation axis ($S_{2n}$).\n\n- **Horizontal Mirror Plane ($\\sigma_h$):** A $\\sigma_h$ plane would be perpendicular to the principal $C_3$ axis and would contain the central cobalt atom. However, the ethylenediamine ligands are puckered and their arrangement is propeller-like. The part of a ligand \"above\" this hypothetical plane is not a mirror image of the part \"below\" it. Reflecting the molecule through this plane does not result in an identical configuration. Therefore, there is no $\\sigma_h$ plane, and the point group cannot be $D_{3h}$.\n\n- **Dihedral Mirror Planes ($\\sigma_d$) or Vertical Mirror Planes ($\\sigma_v$):** A $\\sigma_d$ plane (in the context of D groups) or a $\\sigma_v$ plane would contain the principal $C_3$ axis. Due to the gauche conformation of the ethylenediamine rings and their chiral, propeller-like arrangement, no such plane exists. Reflecting through any plane containing the $C_3$ axis would change the 'handedness' of the propeller and the puckering of the rings, so it would not map the molecule onto itself. The absence of such planes eliminates point groups like $C_{3v}$ and $D_{3d}$.\n\n- **Improper Rotation Axis ($S_{2n}$):** The point group $D_{3d}$ requires an $S_6$ axis coincident with the $C_3$ axis. An $S_6$ operation consists of a rotation by $360^{\\circ}/6 = 60^{\\circ}$ followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Performing a $60^{\\circ}$ rotation on the $[\\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$ complex does not align the ligands in any way that would be corrected by a subsequent reflection. The operation does not leave the molecule unchanged. Thus, there is no $S_6$ axis, and the point group is not $D_{3d}$.\n\nSince the molecule has only the identity element ($E$), a $C_3$ axis, and three perpendicular $C_2$ axes, its point group is $D_3$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the chirality of the molecule based on its point group.\nA molecule is chiral if and only if it does not possess any improper axis of rotation ($S_n$). The improper axes include a center of inversion ($i = S_2$) and a mirror plane ($\\sigma = S_1$).\nMolecules belonging to the point groups $C_n$ and $D_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$) lack any improper rotation axes. The $D_3$ point group, containing the elements $\\{E, C_3, C_3^2, 3C_2\\}$, has no mirror planes and no center of inversion. Therefore, any molecule in the $D_3$ point group is chiral.\nThe $[\\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$ complex exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), known as the $\\Delta$ and $\\Lambda$ isomers.\n\nConclusion: The point group is $D_3$, and the molecule is chiral.
