For a set of operations to be classified as a point group, it must satisfy the four fundamental axioms of a mathematical group: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of an inverse for every element.\n\nConsider the point group $D_{3d}$, which describes the symmetry of molecules like staggered ethane. Let $S$ be a specific subset of the operations from $D_{3d}$, containing only the three dihedral mirror planes: $S = \\{\\sigma_d, \\sigma_d', \\sigma_d''\\}$.\n\nYour task is to determine if the set $S$, under the operation of sequential application (composition), forms a group.

Thus associativity holds automatically for any subset of a symmetry group.\n\nIdentity: The identity element $E$ is not a reflection and is not among the three planes, so $E\\notin S$. Therefore $S$ does not contain an identity element, violating the identity axiom.\n\nClosure: \n1) For any reflection $\\sigma$, $\\sigma \\circ \\sigma = E$.

In $D_{3d}$ the three $\\sigma_d$ planes are evenly spaced around the principal axis, so the angle between adjacent planes is $\\theta=\\pi/3$, and their product is a $C_3$ rotation:\n$$\\sigma_d \\circ \\sigma_d' = C_3,\\quad \\sigma_d \\circ \\sigma_d'' = C_3^2,$$\nneither of which lies in $S$.
