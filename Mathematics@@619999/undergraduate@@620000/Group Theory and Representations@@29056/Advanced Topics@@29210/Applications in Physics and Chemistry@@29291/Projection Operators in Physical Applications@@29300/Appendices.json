Therefore, the projection operator simplifies to:\n$$\n\\hat{P}^{(A_1')} f = \\sum_{R \\in D_{3h}} (1) \\hat{R} f = \\sum_{R \\in D_{3h}} \\hat{R} f\n$$\nThis means we need to apply every symmetry operation in the $D_{3h}$ group to the function $f(x, y, z)$ and sum the results. The group $D_{3h}$ has a total of $1+2+3+1+2+3=12$ operations.\n\nLet's rewrite the function $f(x, y, z)$ as $f = 2z^2 - (x^2 + y^2)$. We will now analyze the effect of each class of symmetry operations on $f$.\n\n1.  **Identity ($E$)**: The identity operation leaves the function unchanged.\n    $$\n    \\hat{E}f = 2z^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = f\n    $$\n    There is one such operation.\n\n2.  **Principal Rotations ($2C_3$)**: These are rotations by $\\pm 2\\pi/3$ about the z-axis. Such a rotation transforms the coordinates $(x, y)$ into $(x', y')$ but leaves $z$ unchanged. A key property of rotations is that they preserve distances from the origin, so $x'^2 + y'^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n    $$\n    \\hat{C}_3 f = 2z^2 - (x'^2 + y'^2) = 2z^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = f\n    $$\n    This applies to both $C_3$ and $C_3^2$. There are two such operations.\n\n3.  **Two-fold Rotations ($3C_2$)**: These are rotations by $\\pi$ about three axes lying in the xy-plane. For any such rotation, the z-coordinate is inverted: $z \\rightarrow -z$. The term $x^2+y^2$ represents the square of the distance of a point from the z-axis, which is invariant under a rotation about an axis in the xy-plane.\n    $$\n    \\hat{C}_2 f = 2(-z)^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 2z^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = f\n    $$\n    This is true for all three $C_2$ operations.\n\n4.  **Horizontal Reflection ($\\sigma_h$)**: This operation reflects across the xy-plane, so $z \\rightarrow -z$, while $x$ and $y$ are unchanged.\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\sigma}_h f = 2(-z)^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 2z^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = f\n    $$\n    There is one such operation.\n\n5.  **Improper Rotations ($2S_3$)**: An improper rotation $S_3$ is a rotation $C_3$ followed by a reflection $\\sigma_h$. We can write the operator as $\\hat{S}_3 = \\hat{\\sigma}_h \\hat{C}_3$. Since we have already found that both $\\hat{C}_3$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_h$ leave $f$ unchanged, their combined action also leaves $f$ unchanged.\n    $$\n    \\hat{S}_3 f = \\hat{\\sigma}_h (\\hat{C}_3 f) = \\hat{\\sigma}_h (f) = f\n    $$\n    This applies to both $S_3$ and $S_3^5=S_3^{-1}$. There are two such operations.\n\n6.  **Vertical Reflections ($3\\sigma_v$)**: These operations are reflections through planes that contain the z-axis. Such a reflection leaves the $z$ coordinate unchanged. It is an isometry in the xy-plane, so the distance from the z-axis, $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, is preserved. Therefore, $x^2+y^2$ is invariant.\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\sigma}_v f = 2z^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = f\n    $$\n    This is true for all three $\\sigma_v$ operations.\n\nWe see that for every operation $R$ in the group $D_{3h}$, we have $\\hat{R}f = f$. The function $f(x, y, z)$ is totally symmetric under all operations of the group.\n\nNow, we can compute the final sum for the projection operator. Since there are 12 operations in the group, and each one returns the original function $f$, the sum is:\n$$\n\\hat{P}^{(A_1')} f = \\sum_{R \\in D_{3h}} \\hat{R} f = \\sum_{R \\in D_{3h}} f = 12 \\cdot f\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f(x, y, z)$:\n$$\n\\hat{P}^{(A_1')} f = 12(2z^2 - x^2 - y^2) = 24z^2 - 12x^2 - 12y^2\n$$\nThis is the resulting function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24z^{2} - 12x^{2} - 12y^{2}}$$", "id": "1635783"}, {"introduction": "In quantum mechanics, trial wavefunctions are often constructed without prior knowledge of their symmetry properties, resulting in a mixture of different symmetry types.
