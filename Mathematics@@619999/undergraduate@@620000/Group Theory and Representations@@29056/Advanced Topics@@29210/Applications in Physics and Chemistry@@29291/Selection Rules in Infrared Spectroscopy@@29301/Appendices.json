Through a combination of spectroscopic and computational methods, the molecule's equilibrium geometry is determined to be trigonal pyramidal, with the unique atom $X$ at the apex.

To further characterize this pollutant, an analyst records its Infrared (IR) absorption spectrum to study its vibrational properties.\n\nThe character table for the $C_{3v}$ point group is provided below, where the final column lists the basis functions that transform according to each irreducible representation.\n\n| $C_{3v}$ | $E$ | $2C_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ | Basis Functions |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $A_1$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | $z$, $x^2+y^2$, $z^2$ |\n| $A_2$ | 1 | 1 | -1 | $R_z$ |\n| $E$ | 2 | -1 | 0 | $(x, y)$, $(R_x, R_y)$, $(x^2-y^2, xy)$, $(xz, yz)$ |\n\nSelect the option that lists all the distinct irreducible representations corresponding to the IR-active vibrational modes of the $XY_3$ molecule.\n\nA. $A_1$, $E$\n\nB. $A_2$, $E$\n\nC. $2A_1$, $2E$\n\nD. $A_1$, $A_2$, $E$\n\nE. $A_1$ only", "solution": "The criterion for IR activity is that a vibrational mode must transform like at least one component of the dipole moment vector. Group theoretically, this means the symmetry species of the vibration must be contained in the set of irreducible representations that carry the basis functions $x$, $y$, or $z$.\n\nFrom the provided $C_{3v}$ character table, the vector components transform as follows: $z$ transforms as $A_{1}$ and $(x,y)$ transform as $E$. The $A_{2}$ irreducible representation corresponds to $R_{z}$ and contains no dipole-vector component, so $A_{2}$ modes are IR inactive.\n\nTherefore, in $C_{3v}$ the IR-active symmetries are $A_{1}$ and $E$. For a trigonal pyramidal $XY_{3}$ molecule (e.g., like $NH_{3}$), the vibrational representation decomposes into only $A_{1}$ and $E$ species (indeed, $2A_{1}+2E$), confirming that the distinct IR-active irreducible representations are $A_{1}$ and $E$.\n\nHence, the correct option is $A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1640525"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simply identifying active symmetries, this next practice challenges you to perform a complete vibrational analysis for a complex molecule.
