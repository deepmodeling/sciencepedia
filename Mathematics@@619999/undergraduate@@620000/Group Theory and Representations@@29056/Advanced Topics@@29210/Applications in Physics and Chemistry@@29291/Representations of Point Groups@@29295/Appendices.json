The character $\\chi(R)$ for a symmetry operation $R$ is equal to the number of basis functions (in this case, H $1s$ orbitals) that are mapped onto themselves by that operation. Let's denote the four H $1s$ orbitals as $\\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\\}$.\n\n1.  **Identity operation ($E$)**: The identity operation leaves every atom and thus every orbital in its original position. Since there are four hydrogen $1s$ orbitals in our basis set, all four are unshifted.\n    Therefore, the character is $\\chi(E) = 4$.\n\n2.  **Three-fold rotation ($C_3$)**: In a tetrahedral molecule, each $C_3$ axis passes through the central carbon atom and one of the hydrogen atoms. When we perform a $C_3$ rotation, the hydrogen atom located on the axis of rotation remains in its position, while the other three hydrogen atoms are permuted among themselves. Since only one hydrogen orbital remains unshifted, the character is $\\chi(C_3) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Two-fold rotation ($C_2$)**: The $C_2$ axes in a tetrahedron pass through the central carbon atom and bisect the angle between two pairs of C-H bonds. For example, a $C_2$ axis can be imagined as passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges of the cube that circumscribes the tetrahedron. No hydrogen atom lies on a $C_2$ axis. A $C_2$ operation swaps the positions of the hydrogens in two pairs. Since no hydrogen atom is left in its original place, no orbital is unshifted.\n    Therefore, the character is $\\chi(C_2) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Four-fold improper rotation ($S_4$)**: The $S_4$ axes coincide with the $C_2$ axes. An $S_4$ operation consists of a $90^\\circ$ rotation about the axis, followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to that axis. This operation maps each hydrogen atom to the position of another hydrogen atom. For instance, a rotation by $90^\\circ$ moves a hydrogen $s_1$ to a new position, and the subsequent reflection moves it to the final position of another hydrogen, say $s_2$. No hydrogen atom ends up in its original location. Thus, no orbital is unshifted.\n    Therefore, the character is $\\chi(S_4) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Dihedral reflection ($\\sigma_d$)**: Each of the six $\\sigma_d$ planes in a tetrahedron contains the central carbon atom and two of the hydrogen atoms. A reflection through such a plane leaves the two hydrogen atoms lying within the plane unshifted, while swapping the two hydrogen atoms that are not in the plane. Since two hydrogen atoms are unshifted by a $\\sigma_d$ operation, the two corresponding $1s$ orbitals are also unshifted.\n    Therefore, the character is $\\chi(\\sigma_d) = 2$.\n\nCombining these results, the characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}_{1s}}$ for the classes $E, 8C_3, 3C_2, 6S_4, 6\\sigma_d$ are (4, 1, 0, 0, 2).

This number is the coefficient $a_{B_2}$ in the decomposition of the vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$. The overall strategy is to first find the characters of the total representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$, then subtract the characters of the translational ($\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}}$) and rotational ($\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}}$) representations to find the characters of $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$. Finally, we will use the reduction formula to find the desired coefficient.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the characters of the total representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$**\nThe character of a reducible representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ for a given symmetry operation $R$, denoted $\\chi_{3N}(R)$, is given by the product of the number of atoms left unmoved by the operation, $N_U(R)$, and the character of the transformation of a set of Cartesian coordinate axes $(x,y,z)$ under that operation, $\\chi_{xyz}(R)$.\nSo, $\\chi_{3N}(R) = N_U(R) \\times \\chi_{xyz}(R)$.\n\nFirst, let's determine $N_U(R)$ for each class of operation in the $D_{2d}$ group for the $AB_4$ molecule ($N=5$ atoms).\n- **E (identity):** All 5 atoms ($A$ and four $B$'s) are unmoved. $N_U(E) = 5$.\n- **$S_4$ (improper rotation):** The principal axis (conventionally the $z$-axis) passes through the central atom $A$. The four $B$ atoms are interchanged by this operation. Therefore, only atom $A$ is unmoved. $N_U(S_4) = 1$.\n- **$C_2$ (rotation):** This is a rotation by $180^\\circ$ about the principal axis. It coincides with the $S_4$ axis. Only atom $A$ lies on this axis. $N_U(C_2) = 1$.\n- **$C'_2$ (perpendicular rotation):** These two axes are perpendicular to the principal $C_2$ axis and pass through atom $A$. In the $D_{2d}$ geometry for an $AB_4$ species (a flattened tetrahedron), these axes pass between the $B$ atoms. Thus, only atom $A$ is unmoved. $N_U(C'_2) = 1$.\n- **$\\sigma_d$ (dihedral reflection):** These two reflection planes contain the principal axis ($C_2$). In this geometry, each plane also contains the central atom $A$ and two of the four $B$ atoms. Thus, 3 atoms are unmoved by this operation. $N_U(\\sigma_d) = 3$.\n\nNext, let's find the character $\\chi_{xyz}(R)$ for the transformation of a vector $(x,y,z)$.\n- **E:** The transformation matrix is the identity matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace (character) is $\\chi_{xyz}(E) = 1+1+1=3$.\n- **$S_4(z)$:** Rotation by $90^\\circ$ about $z$ followed by reflection in the $xy$-plane. The matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(90^\\circ) & -\\sin(90^\\circ) & 0 \\\\ \\sin(90^\\circ) & \\cos(90^\\circ) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $\\chi_{xyz}(S_4)=0+0-1=-1$.\n- **$C_2(z)$:** Rotation by $180^\\circ$ about $z$. The matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $\\chi_{xyz}(C_2)=-1-1+1=-1$.\n- **$C'_2(x)$:** Rotation by $180^\\circ$ about $x$. The matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $\\chi_{xyz}(C'_2)=1-1-1=-1$.\n- **$\\sigma_d$:** In $D_{2d}$, this plane contains the $z$-axis and bisects the angle between the $x$ and $y$ axes. Let's take the plane where $x=y$. The reflection transforms $(x,y,z) \\to (y,x,z)$. The matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $\\chi_{xyz}(\\sigma_d)=0+0+1=1$.\n\nNow we can compute the characters for $\\Gamma_{3N}$:\n- $\\chi_{3N}(E) = N_U(E) \\times \\chi_{xyz}(E) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n- $\\chi_{3N}(S_4) = N_U(S_4) \\times \\chi_{xyz}(S_4) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n- $\\chi_{3N}(C_2) = N_U(C_2) \\times \\chi_{xyz}(C_2) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n- $\\chi_{3N}(C'_2) = N_U(C'_2) \\times \\chi_{xyz}(C'_2) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n- $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_d) = N_U(\\sigma_d) \\times \\chi_{xyz}(\\sigma_d) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\nThe characters for $\\Gamma_{3N}$ are: $(15, -1, -1, -1, 3)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the characters of $\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}}$**\nWe can find the irreducible representations corresponding to translation and rotation by looking at the basis functions in the provided character table.\n- **Translation ($\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}}$):** The translational vectors $(x, y, z)$ serve as a basis. The table shows that $z$ transforms as $B_2$ and the pair $(x,y)$ transforms as $E$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} = B_2 + E$.\n- **Rotation ($\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}}$):** The rotational vectors $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$ serve as a basis. The table shows that $R_z$ transforms as $A_2$ and the pair $(R_x, R_y)$ transforms as $E$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} = A_2 + E$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the characters of the vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$**\nThe characters of the vibrational representation are found by subtracting the characters of the translational and rotational representations from the total representation: $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(R) = \\chi_{3N}(R) - \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(R) - \\chi_{\\text{rot}}(R)$.
