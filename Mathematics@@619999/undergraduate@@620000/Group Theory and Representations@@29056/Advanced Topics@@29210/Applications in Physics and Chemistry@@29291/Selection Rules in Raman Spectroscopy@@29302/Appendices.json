The character of the representation for a given symmetry operation is the number of bonds that are left unshifted by that operation. Let's analyze each class of operation:\n\n1.  **$E$ (Identity):** All four P-Cl bonds remain in their positions. The character is $\\chi(E) = 4$.\n2.  **$2C_4$ (Rotation by 90°):** The principal axis passes through the P atom, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A $90^\\circ$ rotation moves every Cl atom to the position of its neighbor. No bond is left unshifted. The character is $\\chi(C_4) = 0$.\n3.  **$C_2$ (Rotation by 180°):** This is the $C_4^2$ rotation about the same axis. It moves each Cl atom to the position of the one opposite to it. No bond is left unshifted. The character is $\\chi(C_2) = 0$.\n4.  **$2C_2'$ (Rotation by 180°):** These two axes pass through the central P atom and a pair of opposing Cl atoms. A rotation about one of these axes leaves the two bonds lying along the axis unshifted, while the other two bonds are interchanged. The character is $\\chi(C_2') = 2$.\n5.  **$2C_2''$ (Rotation by 180°):** These two axes pass through the P atom and bisect the angles between the P-Cl bonds. A rotation about one of these axes interchanges the bonds in pairs. No bond is left unshifted. The character is $\\chi(C_2'') = 0$.\n6.  **$i$ (Inversion):** The center of inversion is at the P atom. This operation sends each Cl atom to the opposite side of the P atom. No bond is left unshifted. The character is $\\chi(i) = 0$.\n7.  **$2S_4$ (Improper rotation):** This is a $C_4$ rotation followed by a reflection through the plane perpendicular to the axis ($\\sigma_h$). The $C_4$ part moves all bonds, so no bond is left unshifted. The character is $\\chi(S_4) = 0$.\n8.  **$\\sigma_h$ (Horizontal mirror plane):** The molecular plane contains all the atoms. Reflection through this plane leaves all four bonds unshifted. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_h) = 4$.\n9.  **$2\\sigma_v$ (Vertical mirror planes):** These two planes contain the principal axis and a pair of opposing P-Cl bonds (coincident with the $C_2'$ axes). The two bonds lying in the plane are unshifted. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = 2$.\n10. **$2\\sigma_d$ (Dihedral mirror planes):** These two planes contain the principal axis and bisect the angles between the P-Cl bonds (coincident with the $C_2''$ axes). Reflection through these planes interchanges bonds in pairs. No bond is left unshifted. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_d) = 0$.\n\nSo, the characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ are:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}\n & E & 2C_4 & C_2 & 2C_2' & 2C_2'' & i & 2S_4 & \\sigma_h & 2\\sigma_v & 2\\sigma_d \\\\\n\\hline\n\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} & 4 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we reduce this representation into its irreducible components using the reduction formula:\n$$ n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\chi_i(R) \\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(R) $$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group ($h = 1+2+1+2+2+1+2+1+2+2 = 16$), $g_R$ is the number of operations in the class $R$, $\\chi_i(R)$ is the character of the irreducible representation $i$ for class $R$, and $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(R)$ is the character of our reducible representation.\n\nLet's calculate $n_i$ for each irreducible representation:\n$n_{A_{1g}} = \\frac{1}{16} [1(1)(4) + 2(1)(0) + 1(1)(0) + 2(1)(2) + 2(1)(0) + 1(1)(0) + 2(1)(0) + 1(1)(4) + 2(1)(2) + 2(1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{16}(4+4+4+4) = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$.\n\n$n_{B_{1g}} = \\frac{1}{16} [1(1)(4) + 2(-1)(0) + 1(1)(0) + 2(1)(2) + 2(-1)(0) + 1(1)(0) + 2(-1)(0) + 1(1)(4) + 2(1)(2) + 2(-1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{16}(4+4+4+4) = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$.\n\n$n_{E_u} = \\frac{1}{16} [1(2)(4) + 2(0)(0) + 1(-2)(0) + 2(0)(2) + 2(0)(0) + 1(-2)(0) + 2(0)(0) + 1(2)(4) + 2(0)(2) + 2(0)(0)] = \\frac{1}{16}(8+8) = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$.\n\nChecking for other representations will yield zero. For example:\n$n_{A_{2g}} = \\frac{1}{16} [1(1)(4) + 2(1)(0) + 1(1)(0) + 2(-1)(2) + 2(-1)(0) + \\dots] = \\frac{1}{16}(4-4+\\dots) \\neq 1$.\nA quick check shows that the sum of the dimensions of the found irreducible representations ($1 \\times A_{1g}$, $1 \\times B_{1g}$, $1 \\times E_u$) is $1+1+2 = 4$, which equals the dimension of the reducible representation (the character of the identity operation, $\\chi(E)=4$). So, the decomposition is correct.\n\nThus, the stretching vibrations transform as: $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} = A_{1g} \\oplus B_{1g} \\oplus E_u$.\n\nFinally, we apply the selection rule for Raman spectroscopy. A vibrational mode is Raman active if its irreducible representation transforms as one of the quadratic functions ($x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz,$ or any combination). We inspect the rightmost column of the character table for these basis functions.\n\n-   **$A_{1g}$:** The basis includes $x^2+y^2$ and $z^2$. Therefore, the $A_{1g}$ mode is **Raman active**.\n-   **$B_{1g}$:** The basis includes $x^2-y^2$. Therefore, the $B_{1g}$ mode is **Raman active**.\n-   **$E_u$:** The basis is $(x, y)$. These are linear functions, which means this mode is a translational mode and is infrared (IR) active, but not Raman active since there are no quadratic basis functions associated with $E_u$.\n\nTherefore, the Raman-active stretching vibrations are $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$.
