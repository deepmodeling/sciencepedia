Let the quantum state of the particle localized at site $i$ be denoted by the ket $|i\\rangle$, where the sites are numbered consecutively $i=1, 2, ..., 6$ around the hexagon.\n\nThe dynamics of the particle are governed by a Hamiltonian $H$ with the following properties, based on the geometry of the system:\n1.  The on-site energy is identical for all sites: $\\langle i|H|i \\rangle = E_0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\n2.  The particle can transition, or \"hop,\" between adjacent sites only.

Hence any automorphism of the hexagon graph is a symmetry. The full set of such in-plane permutations is the dihedral group of the hexagon, commonly denoted $D_{6}$, generated by $6$-fold rotations about the axis perpendicular to the plane and reflections in vertical mirror planes that map the hexagon to itself. \n\nBecause the hexagon lies in a plane and all sites are coplanar, there is also a horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane) under which each site is left fixed as a point set, so the Hamiltonian is invariant under this reflection as well. The system also possesses a center of inversion at the geometric center of the hexagon; inversion maps each site to the opposite site and preserves adjacency structure and matrix-element values, so it is a symmetry. Including these operations, along with the associated improper rotations formed by combining the $6$-fold rotations with the horizontal mirror, gives the full point group $D_{6h}$.\n\nNow we compare with the options:\n- $C_{6}$ contains only the $6$-fold rotations and misses reflections and inversion present here, so it is too small.\n- $C_{6v}$ adds vertical mirrors to $C_{6}$ but lacks inversion and the horizontal mirror plane, so it is still too small.\n- $D_{3d}$ has a $3$-fold, not a $6$-fold, principal axis, hence does not match a regular hexagon.\n- $C_{1}$ is trivial and incorrect.\n- $D_{6h}$ is the standard full symmetry of a regular planar hexagon (benzene), matching all symmetries above.\n\nTherefore the correct point group is $D_{6h}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1644399"}, {"introduction": "A central application of group theory in quantum mechanics is predicting how energy level degeneracies are determined by the system's symmetry.
