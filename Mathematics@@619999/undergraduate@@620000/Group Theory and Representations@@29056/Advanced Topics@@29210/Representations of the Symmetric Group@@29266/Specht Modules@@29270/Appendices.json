We can represent it as:\n$$t_1 = \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & \\end{array}$$\nThe columns of $t_1$ are $\\{1, 3\\}$ and $\\{2\\}$. The column stabilizer $C_{t_1}$ consists of permutations that fix these sets. The only non-identity permutation that does this is $(13)$. So, $C_{t_1} = \\{\\text{id}, (13)\\}$.\nThe tabloid corresponding to $t_1$ is $\\{t_1\\} = \\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{3\\}\\} = v_1$.\nThe polytabloid $e_{t_1}$ is:\n$$e_{t_1} = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in C_{t_1}} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) \\sigma\\{t_1\\} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\text{id})\\text{id}\\{t_1\\} + \\operatorname{sgn}((13))(13)\\{t_1\\}$$\nSince $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\text{id}) = 1$ and $\\operatorname{sgn}((13)) = -1$:\n$$e_{t_1} = \\text{id}\\{t_1\\} - (13)\\{t_1\\}$$\n$\\text{id}\\{t_1\\} = v_1$.
