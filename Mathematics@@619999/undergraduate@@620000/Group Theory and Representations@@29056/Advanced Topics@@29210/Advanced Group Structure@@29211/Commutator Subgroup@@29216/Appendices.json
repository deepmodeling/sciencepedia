One important subgroup is the commutator subgroup, which provides a measure of how non-abelian the group is.\n\nLet $D_n$ be the dihedral group of order $2n$, representing the symmetries of a regular $n$-gon. It can be defined by the presentation $D_n = \\langle r, s \\mid r^n = e, s^2 = e, srs = r^{-1} \\rangle$, where $e$ is the identity element, $r$ represents a rotation, and $s$ represents a reflection.\n\nThe commutator of two elements $g, h$ in a group $G$ is defined as $[g, h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$.

Since $s=s^{-1}$, we have:\n$$\n[s,r]=srs^{-1}r^{-1}=srsr^{-1}.\n$$\nUsing the relation $srs=r^{-1}$, we obtain\n$$\n[s,r]=r^{-1}r^{-1}=r^{-2}.\n$$\nHence $r^{-2}\\in D_{n}'$.

Thus, $\\langle r\\rangle\\subseteq D_{n}'$.\n\nNext, we use the universal property of the commutator subgroup: for any group $G$, the quotient $G/G'$ is abelian, and $G'$ is the smallest normal subgroup with this property. Consider the quotient group $D_{n}/\\langle r\\rangle$. This group has order $(2n)/n=2$ and is therefore abelian. By the universal property, any normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N$ is abelian must contain the commutator subgroup.
