The set of all possible permutations forms the symmetric group $S_n$. For a permutation to be valid within a specific sub-protocol, it must be an even permutation, meaning it can be expressed as a composition of an even number of two-element swaps (transpositions). The set of all such even permutations forms the alternating group, $A_n$. The fundamental operations in this sub-protocol are '3-cycles'. A 3-cycle is a permutation that cyclically maps three distinct elements, say $i \\to j \\to k \\to i$, while leaving the other $n-3$ elements unchanged. Such a cycle is denoted by $(i \\ j \\ k)$.

The group $A_5$ consists of all even permutations of a set of 5 elements, and its order is 60.

The kernel of this homomorphism would then be a normal subgroup of $A_5$ with an order that is neither 1 nor 60.\n\nD) A subgroup of order 20 can only contain elements whose orders divide 20. However, $A_5$ is known to contain elements of order 3, and since 3 does not divide 20, no such subgroup can be formed.\n\nE) According to the Sylow theorems, a group of order 60 cannot have a subgroup of order 20, as 20 is not a prime power.", "solution": "We are given that $A_5$ is simple and $|A_5|=60$.
