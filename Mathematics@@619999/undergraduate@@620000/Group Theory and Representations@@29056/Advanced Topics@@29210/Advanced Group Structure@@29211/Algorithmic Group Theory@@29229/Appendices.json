Any word can be transformed into a unique freely reduced form by repeatedly finding and removing such pairs. For example, the word $aba^{-1}ab^{-1}$ reduces to $abb^{-1}$, which further reduces to the word $a$. The identity element of the group is the empty word, which is the result of reducing a word like $b a a^{-1} b^{-1}$.\n\nThe \"commutator\" of two elements $u$ and $v$ in a group is defined as $[u, v] = uvu^{-1}v^{-1}$.\n\nGiven the two words $u = bab$ and $v = a^2b$ in $F_2$, determine the freely reduced form of their commutator $[u, v]$.", "solution": "We work in the free group on generators $a$ and $b$.

We can choose $x_3$ as the free parameter. Let $x_3 = t$. The null space is spanned by the vector $(1, -2, 1, 0)^T$.\nThe solutions are of the form $t(1, -2, 1, 0)^T$ for any $t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe are seeking integer solutions for $(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2)$. We relate the null space solution to our original coefficients: $(a_1, a_2, -b_1, -b_2)^T$.\nThe basis for the integer solutions is given by the integer vectors in the null space. Since the basis vector $(1, -2, 1, 0)$ already consists of integers, the general integer solution is given by:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ -b_1 \\\\ -b_2 \\end{pmatrix} = t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $t$ is any integer.\n\nTo find a generator for the intersection subgroup, we can choose a non-zero integer value for $t$.

The vector $u = (-7, -8, -9)$ is a generator for the intersection subgroup $H_1 \\cap H_2$. Any other generator is an integer multiple of $u$.\n\nThe problem asks for the unique primitive basis vector $u=(x, y, z)$ with $x<0$.\nOur found generator is $u = (-7, -8, -9)$.\n1.  Check if it is primitive: We need to calculate $\\text{gcd}(|-7|, |-8|, |-9|) = \\text{gcd}(7, 8, 9)$. Since $\\text{gcd}(7, 8) = 1$, we have $\\text{gcd}(\\text{gcd}(7, 8), 9) = \\text{gcd}(1, 9) = 1$. The vector is primitive.\n2.  Check the condition on the first component: $x = -7$, which is less than 0.\n\nThe vector $u = (-7, -8, -9)$ satisfies both conditions. The only other primitive generator would be $-u=(7, 8, 9)$, but its first component is positive. Therefore, $u=(-7, -8, -9)$ is the unique vector satisfying the problem's requirements.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ -8 \\\\ -9 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "1598193"}]}
