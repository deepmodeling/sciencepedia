This problem introduces a classic technique that combines Sylow's theorems with a careful counting argument to prove that no group of order 56 can be simple [@problem_id:1641457]. Mastering this method is an essential problem-solving skill for ruling out the existence of simple groups for vast families of integer orders.", "problem": "In abstract algebra, a key goal is the classification of finite simple groups, which are the fundamental building blocks of all finite groups. A critical step in this program is determining which group orders can or cannot correspond to a simple group. One of the primary tools for this task is the set of Sylow's theorems.\n\nConsider a group $G$ of order 56. It is a known result that no group of this order can be simple. The proof of this fact relies on analyzing the possible number of Sylow $p$-subgroups, denoted $n_p$, and then counting the elements within them.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and complete logical justification for why a group of order 56 cannot be simple, based on an analysis of its Sylow subgroups and their elements?\n\nA. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, $n_7$, must be 1, because 7 is the largest prime factor of the group's order.\nB. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, $n_2$, must be 1, because the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup ($2^3=8$) is larger than the order of a Sylow 7-subgroup (7).\nC. If a group of order 56 were simple, it would require $n_7=8$ and $n_2=7$. This is impossible because the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (8) is equal to the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup.\nD. For a group of order 56 to be simple, it must not have a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow subgroup for any prime. This would necessitate 8 Sylow 7-subgroups and 7 Sylow 2-subgroups. The 8 Sylow 7-subgroups alone contain 48 distinct elements of order 7, leaving only 8 other elements in the group, which is insufficient to form 7 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups.\nE. By Burnside's Theorem, any group of order $p^a q^b$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, is solvable. Since a group of order $56=2^3 7^1$ has such an order, it must be solvable and therefore cannot be simple.", "solution": "Let $|G|=56=2^{3}\\cdot 7$.

Thus, for $G$ to be simple, one must have\n$$\nn_{7}=8.\n$$\nEach Sylow $7$-subgroup has order $7$ and is cyclic, so it has $6$ non-identity elements, all of order $7$. Any two distinct subgroups of order $7$ intersect trivially, since the intersection is a subgroup of order dividing $7$, and if it were of order $7$ they would be equal.

Thus, for $G$ to be simple, one must have\n$$\nn_{2}=7.\n$$\nEach Sylow $2$-subgroup has order $8$ and therefore contains $7$ non-identity elements. However, from the counting above, there are only $8$ elements in $G$ that are not of order $7$, and among these $8$ elements, exactly $1$ is the identity. Hence there are only $7$ non-identity elements available outside the $48$ elements of order $7$. Consequently, all Sylow $2$-subgroups would have to share exactly the same $7$ non-identity elements, which forces them to be equal, contradicting $n_{2}=7$. Therefore, a simple group of order $56$ cannot exist.\n\nAmong the options, the statement that correctly and completely presents this Sylow-based counting contradiction is:\n- For simplicity, $n_{7}=8$ and $n_{2}=7$; the $8$ Sylow $7$-subgroups already account for $48$ distinct elements, leaving only $8$ elements to accommodate the Sylow $2$-subgroups, which is insufficient to form $7$ distinct subgroups of order $8$.\n\nThus the correct choice is D.
