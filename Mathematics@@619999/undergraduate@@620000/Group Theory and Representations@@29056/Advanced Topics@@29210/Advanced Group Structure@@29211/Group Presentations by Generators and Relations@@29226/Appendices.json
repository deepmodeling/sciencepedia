Determine the order of the element $w$.", "solution": "We use the defining relations of $G$: $a^{5}=1$, $b^{2}=1$, and $b a b = a^{-1}$. From $b a b = a^{-1}$ it follows that $b a = a^{-1} b$, and by induction $b a^{k} = a^{-k} b$ for all integers $k$.\n\nConsider the word $w = a b a^{2} b a^{3}$. Using $b a^{2} = a^{-2} b$, we compute\n$$\nw = a (b a^{2}) b a^{3} = a (a^{-2} b) b a^{3} = a a^{-2} (b b) a^{3} = a^{-1} b^2 a^{3} = a^{-1} a^{3} = a^{2}.\n$$\nThus $w = a^{2}$.
