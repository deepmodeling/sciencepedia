The structure of such a group is well-understood and governed by several key properties. Let $k = |K|$ and $h = |H|$.\n\nFirst, a Frobenius group $G$ is a semidirect product of its kernel $K$ and complement $H$, written as $G = K \\rtimes H$. This structural property implies that the order of the group is the product of the orders of the kernel and the complement:\n$$|G| = |K| |H| = kh$$\nSince $H$ is a proper, non-trivial subgroup, we know that $h > 1$ and $k = |G|/h  |G|$. Since $K$ is also non-trivial (a key part of the definition of the kernel), we must have $k > 1$.\n\nWe are given that $|G| = 56$. Therefore, we have the equation:\n$$kh = 56$$\nwhere $k > 1$ and $h > 1$.\n\nTwo additional fundamental theorems about Frobenius groups impose strong constraints on the possible values of $k$ and $h$:\n1.  The orders of the kernel and the complement are coprime: $\\gcd(k, h) = 1$.\n2.  The order of the complement divides the order of the kernel minus one: $h \\mid (k-1)$. This arises from the fact that the complement $H$ acts by conjugation on the set of non-identity elements of the kernel, $K \\setminus \\{e\\}$, and this action is fixed-point-free. This means every orbit under this action has size $h$. Since these orbits partition the set $K \\setminus \\{e\\}$, which has size $k-1$, it must be that $h$ divides $k-1$.\n\nWe need to find pairs of integers $(k,h)$ that satisfy all three conditions:\n(i) $kh = 56$ (with $k,h > 1$)\n(ii) $\\gcd(k,h) = 1$\n(iii) $h \\mid (k-1)$\n\nLet's start by listing all pairs of factors $(k,h)$ for 56, where both factors are greater than 1:\n- $(k,h) = (2, 28)$\n- $(k,h) = (4, 14)$\n- $(k,h) = (7, 8)$\n- $(k,h) = (8, 7)$\n- $(k,h) = (14, 4)$\n- $(k,h) = (28, 2)$\n\nNext, we apply the coprime condition, $\\gcd(k,h) = 1$:\n- $\\gcd(2, 28) = 2 \\neq 1$. This pair is eliminated.\n- $\\gcd(4, 14) = 2 \\neq 1$. This pair is eliminated.\n- $\\gcd(7, 8) = 1$. This pair is a candidate.\n- $\\gcd(8, 7) = 1$. This pair is a candidate.\n- $\\gcd(14, 4) = 2 \\neq 1$. This pair is eliminated.\n- $\\gcd(28, 2) = 2 \\neq 1$. This pair is eliminated.\n\nWe are left with two possibilities for the pair $(|K|, |H|)$: $(7, 8)$ and $(8, 7)$.\n\nFinally, we apply the divisibility condition, $h \\mid (k-1)$:\n- **Case 1: $(k,h) = (7, 8)$**\n  We check if $h \\mid (k-1)$, which is $8 \\mid (7-1)$, or $8 \\mid 6$. This is false. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n- **Case 2: $(k,h) = (8, 7)$**\n  We check if $h \\mid (k-1)$, which is $7 \\mid (8-1)$, or $7 \\mid 7$. This is true. This case is valid.\n\nThus, the only possible orders for the Frobenius kernel and complement are $|K| = 8$ and $|H| = 7$. The problem asks for the order of the Frobenius kernel, $|K|$.\n\nThe order of the Frobenius kernel $K$ is 8.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1619812"}, {"introduction": "A crucial step in mastering any mathematical definition is to understand not only what it includes but also what it excludes.

The only proper nontrivial normal subgroups of $S_{4}$ are $V \\cong C_{2} \\times C_{2}$ of order $4$ and $A_{4}$ of order $12$. Hence either $|N| = 4$ and $|H| = 6$, or $|N| = 12$ and $|H| = 2$.\n\nFirst exclude $|H| = 2$. If $H = \\langle t \\rangle$ with $t$ a transposition, then all subgroups generated by transpositions are conjugate in $S_{4}$, and there are $6$ of them. Let $n$ be the number of conjugates of $H$.

Therefore $|H| \\neq 2$, so necessarily $|H| = 6$ and $H \\cong S_{3}$.\n\nNow take $H \\cong S_{3}$, for instance the stabilizer of $4$, $H_{4} = \\operatorname{Stab}(4) \\cong S_{3}$. Consider also $H_{3} = \\operatorname{Stab}(3) \\cong S_{3}$. These two subgroups are conjugate in $S_{4}$. The transposition $t = (1 \\ 2)$ lies in both $H_{4}$ and $H_{3}$, since it fixes both $3$ and $4$. Thus $t$ is a non-identity element that belongs to two distinct conjugates of an $S_{3}$ subgroup. This violates the Frobenius condition that any non-identity element lies in at most one conjugate of the complement. Hence $S_{4}$ cannot be a Frobenius group.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because Frobenius groups do have a proper nontrivial normal subgroup (the Frobenius kernel).\n- B is false since a given $4$-cycle does not lie in every Sylow $2$-subgroup.\n- C is true and gives exactly the contradiction described above.\n- D is false since there exist Frobenius groups with trivial center, such as $D_{2n}$ for odd $n$.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1619828"}, {"introduction": "After exploring the group-theoretic structure of Frobenius groups, we now turn to their representation theory.
