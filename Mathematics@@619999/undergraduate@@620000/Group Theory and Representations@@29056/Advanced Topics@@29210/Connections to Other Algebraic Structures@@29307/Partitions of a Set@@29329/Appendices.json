Determine the total number of distinct ways to form these two teams.", "solution": "Let the set of four distinct members be $S = \\{A, B, C, D\\}$, where A, B, C, and D represent Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave, respectively. We are asked to find the number of ways to partition this set of 4 elements into exactly 2 non-empty subsets. The subsets represent the teams.\n\nThe possible sizes of the two non-empty teams must sum to 4. There are two possible structures for the sizes of the partitions:\n1. One team has 3 members and the other has 1 member (a partition of type (3, 1)).\n2. Both teams have 2 members (a partition of type (2, 2)).\n\nWe will count the number of ways for each case separately and then sum the results.\n\n**Case 1: Partition of type (3, 1)**\nIn this case, we form one team of 3 members and one team of 1 member. The process can be thought of as choosing which member will be on the team by themselves. Once we select that single member, the other three members automatically form the second team.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 member out of 4 is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{1}$.\n$$ \\binom{4}{1} = \\frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = \\frac{4!}{1!3!} = 4 $$\nThe 4 possible partitions are:\n- Team 1: {A}, Team 2: {B, C, D}\n- Team 1: {B}, Team 2: {A, C, D}\n- Team 1: {C}, Team 2: {A, B, D}\n- Team 1: {D}, Team 2: {A, B, C}\nSince the teams are not labeled, choosing {A} for one team is the same as choosing {B, C, D} for the other. Our method of choosing the 1-person team correctly and uniquely identifies each partition of this type. So, there are 4 ways to form the teams in this case.\n\n**Case 2: Partition of type (2, 2)**\nIn this case, we form two teams of 2 members each. Let's start by choosing 2 members for the \"first\" team. The number of ways to choose 2 members from 4 is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2}$.\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6 $$\nLet's list these initial selections:\n1. {A, B} (leaving {C, D} for the second team)\n2. {A, C} (leaving {B, D} for the second team)\n3. {A, D} (leaving {B, C} for the second team)\n4. {B, C} (leaving {A, D} for the second team)\n5. {B, D} (leaving {A, C} for the second team)\n6. {C, D} (leaving {A, B} for the second team)\n\nThe problem states that the teams are not labeled or distinguished. In our current counting method, we have treated the \"first\" team we choose as distinct from the \"second\" team that is left over. For example, choosing {A, B} for the first team results in the partition {{A, B}, {C, D}}. However, choosing {C, D} for the first team also results in the partition {{C, D}, {A, B}}. Since the teams are indistinguishable, these two outcomes are the same partition.\n\nOur list of 6 selections has double-counted every possible partition of this type. For any partition with two groups of equal size, say groups G1 and G2, our method counts choosing G1 first and choosing G2 first as distinct events. Since there are 2 teams of the same size, we have counted each partition 2! = 2 times. To correct for this overcounting, we must divide our initial result by 2.\n\nNumber of ways for Case 2 = $\\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$.\nThe 3 distinct partitions are:\n- {{A, B}, {C, D}}\n- {{A, C}, {B, D}}\n- {{A, D}, {B, C}}\n\n**Total Number of Ways**\nThe total number of ways to split the members is the sum of the number of ways from Case 1 and Case 2.\nTotal ways = (Ways for Case 1) + (Ways for Case 2) = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nThis number is also known as the Stirling number of the second kind, denoted $S(4, 2)$ or $\\begin{Bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{Bmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1812669"}, {"introduction": "Partitions are not just a combinatorial curiosity; they are a foundational structure in group theory.
