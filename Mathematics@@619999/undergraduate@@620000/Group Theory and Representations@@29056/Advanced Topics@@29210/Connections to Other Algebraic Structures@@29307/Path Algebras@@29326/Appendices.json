Let's define the necessary concepts.\n\nA **quiver** $Q = (Q_0, Q_1, s, t)$ is a directed graph, specified by a set of vertices $Q_0$, a set of arrows $Q_1$, and two maps, $s, t: Q_1 \\to Q_0$, which assign to each arrow its source and target vertex, respectively.\n\nA **path** of length $k \\ge 1$ in a quiver $Q$ is a sequence of arrows $p = a_k \\dots a_2 a_1$ such that $t(a_i) = s(a_{i+1})$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k-1$. The source of the path is $s(p) = s(a_1)$ and the target is $t(p) = t(a_k)$.

The multiplication of two paths $p$ and $q$ is defined by their concatenation: if $p = a_k \\dots a_1$ and $q = b_l \\dots b_1$ are two paths, their product $pq$ is the concatenated path $a_k \\dots a_1 b_l \\dots b_1$ if $s(p)=t(q)$, and is 0 otherwise. Multiplication of trivial paths is given by $e_v e_w = \\delta_{vw} e_v$, where $\\delta_{vw}$ is the Kronecker delta. This multiplication is extended linearly to all elements of $kQ$.\n\nConsider the **linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$**, denoted by $Q$, which has the set of vertices $Q_0 = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and the set of arrows $Q_1 = \\{\\alpha: 1 \\to 2, \\beta: 2 \\to 3\\}$. Let the field be the complex numbers, $k=\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nWithin the path algebra $\\mathbb{C}Q$, we can define a **two-sided ideal** $I$ generated by a linear combination of paths. Consider the ideal $I$ generated by the path of length 2, which we denote as $\\rho = \\beta\\alpha$. An ideal generated by an element $\\rho$ consists of all finite sums of elements of the form $p \\rho q$ where $p, q$ are any paths in $Q$. We then form the **quotient algebra** $A = \\mathbb{C}Q / I$, in which the element $\\rho$ is identified with 0.\n\nFind a specific non-zero element $x$ in the algebra $A$ that can be written as a linear combination of at least two distinct basis paths of $A$, and satisfies the condition $x^2 = 0$.", "solution": "First, we must determine the basis of the quotient algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}Q/I$. The path algebra $\\mathbb{C}Q$ for the linearly oriented $A_3$ quiver has a basis consisting of all possible paths. These are:\n- The trivial paths of length 0: $e_1, e_2, e_3$.\n- The paths of length 1 (the arrows): $\\alpha: 1 \\to 2$, $\\beta: 2 \\to 3$.\n- The path of length 2: $\\beta\\alpha: 1 \\to 3$ (concatenation of $\\alpha$ followed by $\\beta$, since $t(\\alpha)=2=s(\\beta)$).\nThere are no paths of length 3 or greater. Thus, the basis for $\\mathbb{C}Q$ is $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, \\alpha, \\beta, \\beta\\alpha\\}$.\n\nThe ideal $I$ is generated by the path $\\rho = \\beta\\alpha$. This means $I$ is the linear span of all elements of the form $p(\\beta\\alpha)q$ where $p,q$ are paths. Since there are no arrows starting at vertex 3 (the target of $\\beta\\alpha$) and no arrows ending at vertex 1 (the source of $\\beta\\alpha$), the only paths $p,q$ for which $p(\\beta\\alpha)q$ can be non-zero are the trivial paths $p=e_3$ and $q=e_1$. However, $e_3(\\beta\\alpha)e_1 = \\beta\\alpha$. Thus, the ideal $I$ is simply the one-dimensional subspace spanned by $\\beta\\alpha$, i.e., $I = \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{C}}\\{\\beta\\alpha\\}$.\n\nThe quotient algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}Q/I$ is formed by setting all elements of $I$ to zero. This means that in $A$, we have the relation $\\beta\\alpha = 0$. The basis of $A$ consists of the paths in $Q$ that are not in $I$. Therefore, a basis for $A$ is $\\mathcal{B} = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3, \\alpha, \\beta\\}$.\n\nLet $x$ be a general element in $A$.

Let's compute $x^2$. We use the multiplication rules of the path algebra, keeping in mind the relation $\\beta\\alpha=0$.\nThe non-zero products between basis elements are:\n- $e_i e_i = e_i$ for $i=1,2,3$.\n- $e_2 \\alpha = \\alpha$, $\\alpha e_1 = \\alpha$.\n- $e_3 \\beta = \\beta$, $\\beta e_2 = \\beta$.\n- $\\beta \\alpha = 0$ (in $A$).\nAll other products of basis elements are zero. For instance, $\\alpha^2 = 0$ since $s(\\alpha)=1 \\neq t(\\alpha)=2$. Similarly, $\\beta^2=0$ and $\\alpha\\beta=0$.\n\nLet's expand $x^2$:\n$$x^2 = (c_1 e_1 + c_2 e_2 + c_3 e_3 + c_4 \\alpha + c_5 \\beta)^2$$\nWe can group terms by path length.

Since $c_2=c_3=0$, this equation becomes $0 \\cdot c_5 = 0$, which is satisfied for any $c_5$.\n\nSo, any element $x$ of the form $x = c_4 \\alpha + c_5 \\beta$ satisfies $x^2=0$.\nThe problem asks for a *non-zero* element that is a linear combination of at least *two* distinct basis paths. This means we must choose both $c_4$ and $c_5$ to be non-zero.\nA simple choice is to take $c_4 = 1$ and $c_5 = 1$.
