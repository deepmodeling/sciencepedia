A function $f: G \\to M$ is represented by the pair $(f(0), f(1))$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the set of 1-cocycles, $Z^1(G, M)$.**\n\nA function $f: G \\to M$ is a 1-cocycle if it satisfies the condition $f(g_1 + g_2) = f(g_1) + g_1 \\cdot f(g_2)$ for all $g_1, g_2 \\in G$.

Let $g_1 = 0$ and $g_2 = 0$.\n$$f(0+0) = f(0) + 0 \\cdot f(0)$$\nSince $0$ is the identity in $G$, the action is $0 \\cdot m = m$ for any $m \\in M$.\n$$f(0) = f(0) + f(0)$$\nSubtracting $f(0)$ from both sides (in the group $M = \\mathbb{Z}_4$) gives $f(0) = 0$.

Let's denote $f(1) = c$, where $c$ can be any element in $M = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nWe must check if the cocycle condition holds for all pairs $(g_1, g_2)$. The cases involving $g_1=0$ or $g_2=0$ are trivial.

This confirms that all 1-coboundaries are also 1-cocycles.\n\nNow we compute the value at $g=1$:\n$f(1) = 1 \\cdot m - m = (-m) - m = -2m \\pmod 4$.\n\nLet's find the function $(f(0), f(1))$ for each $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4$:\n- For $m=0$: $f(1) = -2(0) = 0$. The function is $(0,0)$.\n- For $m=1$: $f(1) = -2(1) = -2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. The function is $(0,2)$.\n- For $m=2$: $f(1) = -2(2) = -4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.
