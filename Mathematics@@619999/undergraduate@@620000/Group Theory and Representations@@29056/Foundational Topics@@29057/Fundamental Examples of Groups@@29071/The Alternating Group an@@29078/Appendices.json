This exercise challenges you to do just that by taking a census of the elements of a specific order within the alternating group $A_5$.

The Alternating group, denoted as $A_5$, is the subgroup of $S_5$ that contains all the even permutations. The order of a group element $g$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $g^k$ is the identity element of the group.\n\nDetermine the total number of elements in $A_5$ that have an order of exactly 3.", "solution": "An element of $S_{5}$ has order exactly $3$ if and only if the least common multiple of the lengths in its disjoint cycle decomposition is $3$. In $S_{5}$, the only possible cycle structure with least common multiple $3$ is a single $3$-cycle together with two fixed points, since a product of two disjoint $3$-cycles is impossible on $5$ symbols.\n\nThe sign of a $k$-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$, so a $3$-cycle is even because $(-1)^{3-1}=(-1)^{2}=1$. Hence every $3$-cycle lies in $A_{5}$, and there are no other elements of order $3$ in $A_{5}$.\n\nThe number of $3$-cycles in $S_{5}$ is computed by first choosing the $3$ symbols, and then counting the distinct cyclic orderings of those $3$ symbols. For a chosen $3$-element subset, the number of distinct $3$-cycles is $(3-1)!=2$.

A permutation is called *even* if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions (swaps of two elements).

The only permutations on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ that commute with a $3$-cycle are its powers $\\{\\operatorname{id},\\sigma,\\sigma^{2}\\}$.
