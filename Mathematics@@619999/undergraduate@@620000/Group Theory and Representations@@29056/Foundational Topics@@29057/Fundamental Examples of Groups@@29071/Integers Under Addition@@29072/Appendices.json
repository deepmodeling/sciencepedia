Equivalently, every subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is of the form $n\\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$.\n\nSet A: Integers whose decimal representation ends with $3$ are precisely $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} : n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}\\}$, which is a coset $3 + 10\\mathbb{Z}$, not a subgroup. It does not contain $0$ since $0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$, and it is not closed under inverses because, for example, $3 \\in A$ but $-3 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10} \\notin A$. Therefore, A is not a subgroup.\n\nSet B: Integers that are multiples of $7$ form $7\\mathbb{Z}$. This set contains $0$ since $0 = 7 \\cdot 0$. If $x = 7m$ and $y = 7n$, then $x + y = 7(m + n) \\in 7\\mathbb{Z}$, so it is closed under addition. If $x = 7m$, then $-x = 7(-m) \\in 7\\mathbb{Z}$, so it is closed under inverses. Hence B is a subgroup.\n\nSet C: The set $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{\\pm p : p \\text{ is prime}\\}$ contains $0$ and is closed under inverses because if $p$ is prime then $-p$ is included. However, it is not closed under addition: for instance, $2 \\in C$ and $2 \\in C$ but $2 + 2 = 4 \\notin C$. Therefore, C is not a subgroup.\n\nSet D: The set of perfect cubes is $\\{a^{3} : a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. It contains $0$ since $0 = 0^{3}$ and is closed under inverses because $(-a)^{3} = -a^{3}$. It is not closed under addition: for example, $1 = 1^{3}$ and $8 = 2^{3}$ are in the set, but $1 + 8 = 9$ is not a cube. Therefore, D is not a subgroup.\n\nSet E: Integers whose decimal representation ends with $0$ are precisely the multiples of $10$, i.e., $10\\mathbb{Z}$. This set contains $0$, is closed under addition and taking inverses by the same reasoning as for $7\\mathbb{Z}$.
