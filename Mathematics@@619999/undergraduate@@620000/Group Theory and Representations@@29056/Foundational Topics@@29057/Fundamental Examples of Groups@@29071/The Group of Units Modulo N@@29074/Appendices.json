The system uses a public key $(n, e)$ for encryption and a private key $(n, d)$ for decryption. The modulus $n$ is generated by multiplying two distinct large prime numbers, $p$ and $q$. The public exponent, $e$, is an integer that is coprime to $\\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$. The private exponent, $d$, is then calculated to be the multiplicative inverse of $e$ modulo $\\phi(n)$.
