The set of left cosets of $H$ in $Q_8$, denoted $Q_8/H$, forms a group under the operation of coset multiplication, which is defined as $(g_1 H)(g_2 H) = (g_1 g_2) H$ for any $g_1, g_2 \\in Q_8$.\n\nWhat is the order of the element $jH$ in the group $Q_8/H$?", "solution": "The problem asks for the order of the element $jH$ in the quotient group $Q_8/H$. The order of an element $a$ in a group is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n$ equals the identity element of the group.\n\nFirst, let's identify the elements and structure of the quotient group $Q_8/H$.\nThe order of the group $Q_8$ is $|Q_8|=8$.\nThe subgroup is $H = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$, so its order is $|H|=4$.\nThe number of distinct left cosets, which is the order of the quotient group $Q_8/H$, is given by Lagrange's theorem: $|Q_8/H| = |Q_8| / |H| = 8 / 4 = 2$.\n\nSince the quotient group has order 2, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$. A group of order 2 has two elements: the identity and one other element of order 2. Let's find these elements explicitly.\n\nThe elements of $Q_8/H$ are the distinct left cosets of $H$ in $Q_8$.\nOne coset is the subgroup $H$ itself, which serves as the identity element of the quotient group. We can obtain it by multiplying any element of $H$ by $H$. For example:\n$1H = \\{1 \\cdot 1, 1 \\cdot (-1), 1 \\cdot i, 1 \\cdot (-i)\\} = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\} = H$.\n\nThe other coset can be found by taking an element of $Q_8$ that is not in $H$ and forming its coset. Let's use $j \\in Q_8$.\nThe coset $jH$ is:\n$jH = \\{j \\cdot 1, j \\cdot (-1), j \\cdot i, j \\cdot (-i)\\}$.\n\nWe use the defining relations of $Q_8$:\n$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$.\nFrom $ijk = -1$, we can find $ij$: multiply on the right by $k^{-1}$. Since $k^2 = -1$, $k \\cdot k = -1$, so $k^{-1}=-k$. Thus, $ij = (-1)k^{-1} = (-1)(-k) = k$.\nThe other required relations are $ji=-k$, $jk=i$, $kj=-i$, $ki=j$, $ik=-j$.\n\nLet's compute the elements of $jH$:\n$j \\cdot 1 = j$\n$j \\cdot (-1) = -j$\n$j \\cdot i = -k$\n$j \\cdot (-i) = -(-k) = k$\n\nSo, the second coset is $jH = \\{j, -j, k, -k\\}$.\nThe two distinct elements of the quotient group $Q_8/H$ are $H$ and $jH$.\n\nThe identity element of $Q_8/H$ is $H$. We need to find the order of the element $jH$. This is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(jH)^n = H$.\n\nLet's compute powers of $jH$:\nFor $n=1$: $(jH)^1 = jH$. Since $jH \\neq H$, the order is not 1.\n\nFor $n=2$: $(jH)^2 = (jH)(jH)$. By the definition of coset multiplication, this is $(j \\cdot j)H = j^2 H$.\nAccording to the relations of $Q_8$, we have $j^2 = -1$.\nSo, $(jH)^2 = (-1)H$.\n\nNow we must evaluate the coset $(-1)H$. An element $g$ belongs to $H$ if and only if the coset $gH$ is equal to $H$ itself.\nSince $-1$ is an element of the subgroup $H = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$, the coset $(-1)H$ is equal to $H$:\n$(-1)H = \\{-1 \\cdot 1, -1 \\cdot (-1), -1 \\cdot i, -1 \\cdot (-i)\\} = \\{-1, 1, -i, i\\} = H$.\n\nTherefore, $(jH)^2 = H$.\nSince $n=2$ is the smallest positive integer for which $(jH)^n = H$, the order of the element $jH$ in the group $Q_8/H$ is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1652979"}, {"introduction": "This final practice connects our concrete exploration of $Q_8$ to the powerful and abstract framework of group presentations.

Next, compute the conjugate of $a^{2}$:\n$$\nba^{2}b^{-1}=(bab^{-1})(bab^{-1})=a^{-1}a^{-1}=a^{-2}.\n$$\nSince $a^{4}=e$, we have $a^{-2}=a^{2}$, hence\n$$\nba^{2}b^{-1}=a^{2},\n$$\nso $a^{2}$ is central. In particular, $b^{2}=a^{2}$ also commutes with both $a$ and $b$.\n\nNormal forms: using $ba=a^{-1}b$, any word in $a^{\\pm 1},b^{\\pm 1}$ can be rewritten by moving every $b$ to the right past powers of $a$:\n$$\n\\text{(any word)}=a^{i}b^{j},\n$$\nwhere $i\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and $j\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$. Using $b^{2}=a^{2}$ and the centrality of $a^{2}$, we reduce $b^{j}$ as follows:\n- If $j$ is even, then $b^{j}=(b^{2})^{j/2}=(a^{2})^{j/2}$, which can be absorbed into $a^{i}$.\n- If $j$ is odd, then $b^{j}=(b^{2})^{(j-1)/2}b=(a^{2})^{(j-1)/2}b$, and the central factor again absorbs into $a^{i}$, leaving a single $b$ on the right.\n\nReducing $i$ modulo $4$ using $a^{4}=e$, every element can be written in one of the forms\n$$\na^{i} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a^{i}b \\quad \\text{with } i\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}.\n$$\nThus $|G|\\leq 8$.\n\nTo show that there are no further identifications, construct a homomorphism onto the quaternion group of order $8$.
