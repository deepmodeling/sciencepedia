By Lagrange’s theorem, the order of any subgroup divides $|D_{4}|=8$, so possible subgroup orders are $1,2,4,8$.\n\nFirst, determine element orders. We have $|r|=4$, $|r^{2}|=2$, and for any reflection $t\\in\\{s,sr,sr^{2},sr^{3}\\}$, $t^{2}=e$, so each reflection has order $2$. Hence the elements of order $2$ are $r^{2},s,sr,sr^{2},sr^{3}$.\n\nSubgroups of order $1$: the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$, which is cyclic.\n\nSubgroups of order $2$: each generated by an element of order $2$.

Any set $\\{e,r^{2},t,u\\}$ with $t,u$ reflections is closed if and only if $tu=r^{2}$; this occurs exactly when $u=tr^{2}$, yielding precisely the two Klein four subgroups above.

An isomorphism between two groups is a structure-preserving bijection. This means that if two groups are isomorphic, they must be identical in all their group properties, such as being abelian, having the same number of elements of a given order, or having the same subgroup structure. We will analyze each option to see which one presents a true statement that correctly explains the non-isomorphism.\n\nFirst, let's establish the properties of each group.\n\nProperties of $\\mathbb{Z}_8 = (\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}, +_8)$:\n- This group is cyclic, as it can be generated by the element 1 (since all other elements can be obtained by adding 1 to itself repeatedly). Since all cyclic groups are abelian, $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ is an abelian group.\n- The order of an element $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_n$ under addition is given by $\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k)}$. Let's find the orders of the elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_8$:\n  - $\\text{ord}(0) = 1$\n  - $\\text{ord}(1) = 8/\\gcd(8,1) = 8$\n  - $\\text{ord}(2) = 8/\\gcd(8,2) = 4$\n  - $\\text{ord}(3) = 8/\\gcd(8,3) = 8$\n  - $\\text{ord}(4) = 8/\\gcd(8,4) = 2$\n  - $\\text{ord}(5) = 8/\\gcd(8,5) = 8$\n  - $\\text{ord}(6) = 8/\\gcd(8,6) = 4$\n  - $\\text{ord}(7) = 8/\\gcd(8,7) = 8$\n- In summary, $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ has one element of order 1, one element of order 2, two elements of order 4, and four elements of order 8.\n\nProperties of $D_4 = \\langle r, s \\mid r^4 = s^2 = e, srs = r^{-1} \\rangle$:\n- The relation $srs = r^{-1}$ implies $sr = r^{-1}s^{-1} = r^{-1}s=r^3s$. However, $rs = s r s s = sr^{-1}s s = s r^3$. In general $rs \\neq sr$, so the group is non-abelian.\n- The orders of the elements are determined by the given relations:\n  - $\\text{ord}(e) = 1$\n  - $\\text{ord}(r) = 4$ (given by $r^4=e$)\n  - $\\text{ord}(r^2) = 2$ (since $(r^2)^2 = r^4 = e$)\n  - $\\text{ord}(r^3) = 4$ (since $(r^3)^4 = (r^4)^3=e^3=e$, and lower powers are not $e$)\n  - $\\text{ord}(s) = 2$ (given by $s^2=e$)\n  - For the reflection elements:\n    - $\\text{ord}(sr)$: $(sr)^2 = srsr = s(rs)r = s(sr^3)r = s^2r^3r = e r^4 = e$.

So $\\text{ord}(sr^3)=2$.\n- In summary, $D_4$ has one element of order 1, five elements of order 2 ($r^2, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3$), and two elements of order 4 ($r, r^3$). The maximum order of any element in $D_4$ is 4.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA. $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ has an element of order 8, but $D_4$ does not.\nThis statement is TRUE. As shown above, $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ has four elements of order 8 (namely 1, 3, 5, and 7), while the highest order of any element in $D_4$ is 4. Since an isomorphism preserves the order of elements, the fact that their sets of element orders are different is a valid reason why they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nB. $D_4$ contains non-identity elements that are their own inverses, but $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ does not.\nAn element that is its own inverse is an element of order 2 (or 1, but the option specifies non-identity). $D_4$ has five such elements. The statement claims $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ has none. This is FALSE. The element $4 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_8$ has order 2, since $4+4=8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n\nC. The inverse of every element in $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ is unique, whereas in $D_4$ it is not.\nThis statement is FALSE. A fundamental axiom of group theory is that every element in any group has a unique inverse.\n\nD. Both groups are non-abelian.\nThis statement is FALSE. As established earlier, $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ is a cyclic group and is therefore abelian. $D_4$ is non-abelian.\n\nE. $D_4$ has a subgroup of order 4, but $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ does not.\nThis statement is FALSE. $D_4$ does have subgroups of order 4, for example, the subgroup of rotations $\\langle r \\rangle = \\{e, r, r^2, r^3\\}$. However, $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ also has a subgroup of order 4, which is $\\langle 2 \\rangle = \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement that provides a valid reason for the non-isomorphism of $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ and $D_4$ is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1647295"}, {"introduction": "Our exploration now broadens from specific examples to the general family of dihedral groups, $D_n$.
