Any permutation can be expressed as a product (composition) of adjacent transpositions.\n\nConsider the specific transposition $\\tau = (1 \\ n)$. We can construct a representation of $\\tau$ as a product of adjacent transpositions by imagining their effect on an ordered list $(1, 2, \\ldots, n)$. The construction proceeds in two stages:\n\n1.  First, a sequence of adjacent transpositions is applied to move the element $1$ from its initial position (position 1) to position $n$. This is done by successively swapping the element $1$ with its right-hand neighbor until it reaches the end of the list.\n2.  Second, starting from the list configuration at the end of Stage 1, a new sequence of adjacent transpositions is applied. This sequence moves the element $n$ (which was originally at position $n$) from its current position to position 1, by successively swapping it with its left-hand neighbor.\n\nThe composition of all transpositions applied in both stages yields the permutation $(1 \\ n)$.
