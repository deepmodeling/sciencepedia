The alternating group, $A_n$, is the subgroup of $S_n$ containing all even permutations. A permutation is even if it can be written as a product of an even number of transpositions (2-cycles).

Since $(1\\,3\\,2)=(1\\,2\\,3)^{-1}$, we have $\\langle S_{A}\\rangle=\\langle(1\\,2\\,3)\\rangle=\\{e,(1\\,2\\,3),(1\\,3\\,2)\\}$, a cyclic subgroup of order $3$.
