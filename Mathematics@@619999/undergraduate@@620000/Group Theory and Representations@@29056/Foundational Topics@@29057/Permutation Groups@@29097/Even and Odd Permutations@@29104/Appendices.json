This practice exercise bridges the gap between an abstract algebraic concept and a tangible scenario involving a robotic arm. By translating a set of described movements into the formal language of a disjoint cycle decomposition, you will practice the essential skill of calculating a permutation's parity and understanding its fundamental meaning: whether the rearrangement can be accomplished with an even or an odd number of simple swaps. [@problem_id:1616567]", "problem": "A robotic arm is programmed to rearrange 10 distinct electronic components, initially arranged in a line and numbered 1 through 10 from left to right. The rearrangement protocol is defined by the following set of simultaneous operations:\n- The component in position 1 is moved to position 2.\n- The component in position 2 is moved to position 3.\n- The component in position 3 is moved to position 4.\n- The component in position 4 is moved to position 1.\n- The component in position 5 is moved to position 6.\n- The component in position 6 is moved to position 7.\n- The component in position 7 is moved to position 5.\n- The components in positions 8 and 9 are exchanged.\n- The component in position 10 remains in its position.\n\nThe fundamental operation of the robotic arm is a 'swap,' which consists of exchanging the positions of exactly two components. Any rearrangement can be expressed as a sequence of these swaps. Based on the protocol, which of the following statements is true about the number of swaps required to achieve this specific final configuration from the initial one?\n\nA.

The number of swaps required can be either even or odd, depending on the sequence of swaps chosen.\n\nD. This rearrangement is impossible to achieve with swaps.", "solution": "The problem asks about the parity of the number of swaps (transpositions) needed to achieve a specific rearrangement of 10 objects. This is equivalent to determining the parity (or sign) of the permutation corresponding to the rearrangement.\n\nFirst, we represent the rearrangement as a permutation $\\sigma$ of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. We can determine the disjoint cycle decomposition of $\\sigma$ by tracing the movement of each component.\n\nThe movements of the components in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are described as: $1 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 3$, $3 \\to 4$, and $4 \\to 1$. This forms a 4-cycle: $(1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)$.\n\nThe movements of the components in positions 5, 6, and 7 are described as: $5 \\to 6$, $6 \\to 7$, and $7 \\to 5$. This forms a 3-cycle: $(5\\ 6\\ 7)$.\n\nThe components in positions 8 and 9 are exchanged, meaning $8 \\to 9$ and $9 \\to 8$. This forms a 2-cycle, which is also a transposition: $(8\\ 9)$.\n\nThe component in position 10 remains in its position. This is a fixed point, which can be represented as a 1-cycle: $(10)$.\n\nThus, the permutation $\\sigma$ corresponding to the complete rearrangement can be written as a product of these disjoint cycles:\n$$\n\\sigma = (1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)(5\\ 6\\ 7)(8\\ 9)(10)\n$$\nThe parity of a permutation is determined by its sign, which is the product of the signs of its disjoint cycles. The sign of a $k$-cycle is given by $(-1)^{k-1}$. A permutation is called even if its sign is $+1$ and odd if its sign is $-1$.\n\nLet's calculate the sign of each cycle in the decomposition of $\\sigma$:\n- The sign of the 4-cycle $(1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)$ is $(-1)^{4-1} = (-1)^3 = -1$.\n- The sign of the 3-cycle $(5\\ 6\\ 7)$ is $(-1)^{3-1} = (-1)^2 = +1$.\n- The sign of the 2-cycle $(8\\ 9)$ is $(-1)^{2-1} = (-1)^1 = -1$.\n- The sign of the 1-cycle $(10)$ is $(-1)^{1-1} = (-1)^0 = +1$.\n\nThe sign of the entire permutation $\\sigma$, denoted $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$, is the product of the signs of its constituent disjoint cycles:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = \\text{sgn}((1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)) \\cdot \\text{sgn}((5\\ 6\\ 7)) \\cdot \\text{sgn}((8\\ 9)) \\cdot \\text{sgn}((10))\n$$\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = (-1) \\cdot (+1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (+1) = +1\n$$\nSince the sign of the permutation is $+1$, $\\sigma$ is an even permutation.\n\nA 'swap' as defined in the problem is a transposition. A fundamental result in group theory states that any permutation can be written as a product of transpositions. While the decomposition is not unique, the parity of the number of transpositions is an invariant of the permutation. An even permutation can only be written as a product of an even number of transpositions, and an odd permutation can only be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\nSince we have determined that the permutation $\\sigma$ is even, any sequence of swaps (transpositions) that achieves this rearrangement must consist of an even number of swaps.\n\nTherefore, the number of swaps required is always even.
