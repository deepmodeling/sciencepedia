This first exercise provides a practical scenario involving a data scrambler, where the shuffling operation is already defined by its disjoint cycles. Your task is to apply the fundamental principle: the order of a permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles, which directly corresponds to the number of times the operation must be repeated to restore the original state.[@problem_id:1632998]", "problem": "A team of engineers is designing a simple data scrambler. The scrambler operates on an ordered list of 12 data packets, indexed by the set of integers $S = \\{1, 2, ..., 12\\}$.
