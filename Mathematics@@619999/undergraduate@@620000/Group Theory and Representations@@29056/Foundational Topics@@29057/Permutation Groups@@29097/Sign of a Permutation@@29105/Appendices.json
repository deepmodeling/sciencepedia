This exercise provides practice with the essential rules: the sign of a $k$-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$, and the sign of a permutation is the product of the signs of its disjoint cycles. Mastering this technique is fundamental to working with permutations efficiently. [@problem_id:1641179]", "problem": "Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group on a set of $n$ elements. Consider a permutation $\\sigma \\in S_7$. The disjoint cycle decomposition of $\\sigma$ consists of exactly one cycle of length 3 and one cycle of length 4. Determine the sign of the permutation $\\sigma$, which is denoted by $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$.", "solution": "The sign of a permutation, $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$, is a value that indicates whether the permutation is even ($+1$) or odd ($-1$). To determine the sign of the given permutation $\\sigma$, we will use two fundamental properties of permutations and their cycle decompositions.\n\nFirst, if a permutation is written as a product of disjoint cycles, its sign is the product of the signs of those individual cycles. In this problem, the permutation $\\sigma$ is a product of a 3-cycle, let's call it $c_3$, and a 4-cycle, $c_4$. Since these cycles are disjoint, we can write $\\sigma = c_3 c_4$. Therefore, the sign of $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = \\text{sgn}(c_3) \\times \\text{sgn}(c_4)\n$$\n\nSecond, the sign of a cycle of length $k$ (a $k$-cycle) is given by the formula $(-1)^{k-1}$. A $k$-cycle is an even permutation if $k-1$ is even (i.e., $k$ is odd), and an odd permutation if $k-1$ is odd (i.e., $k$ is even). This formula arises from the fact that any $k$-cycle can be decomposed into a product of $k-1$ transpositions (2-cycles).\n\nNow, we apply this second property to find the signs of $c_3$ and $c_4$.\n\nFor the 3-cycle, $c_3$, the length is $k=3$. Its sign is:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(c_3) = (-1)^{3-1} = (-1)^2 = 1\n$$\nSo, the 3-cycle is an even permutation.\n\nFor the 4-cycle, $c_4$, the length is $k=4$. Its sign is:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(c_4) = (-1)^{4-1} = (-1)^3 = -1\n$$\nSo, the 4-cycle is an odd permutation.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the sign of the total permutation $\\sigma$ by multiplying the signs of its disjoint cycle components:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = \\text{sgn}(c_3) \\times \\text{sgn}(c_4) = (1) \\times (-1) = -1\n$$\n\nThus, the permutation $\\sigma$ is an odd permutation, and its sign is $-1$. The fact that the permutation is in $S_7$ is consistent with its cycle structure, as the 3-cycle and the 4-cycle operate on a total of $3+4=7$ distinct elements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "1641179"}, {"introduction": "Beneath the concept of cycles lies a more fundamental definition of a permutation's sign, which is based on counting \"inversions\"â€”pairs of elements that are out of their natural order. This problem challenges you to compute the sign by directly counting inversions for a specific class of permutations, reinforcing the connection between the sign and the degree of disorder a permutation introduces.

An inversion is a pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $i < j$ but $\\sigma(i) > \\sigma(j)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the action of the permutation $\\sigma$. The elements from $k+1$ to $n$ are fixed points, meaning $\\sigma(i) = i$ for $i > k$. These fixed points do not contribute to inversions. An inversion can only occur among pairs $(i, j)$ where at least one of them is moved by the permutation.\n\nLet's consider the possible cases for a pair $(i, j)$ with $i < j$:\n\nCase 1: $i > k$ and $j > k$.\nIn this case, $\\sigma(i) = i$ and $\\sigma(j) = j$. Since $i < j$, we have $\\sigma(i) < \\sigma(j)$. There are no inversions in this case.\n\nCase 2: $i \\le k$ and $j > k$.\nHere, $\\sigma(i) = k - i + 1$ and $\\sigma(j) = j$. Since $i \\ge 1$, we have $\\sigma(i) = k - i + 1 \\le k$. Since $j > k$, it is always true that $\\sigma(i) \\leq k < j = \\sigma(j)$. So, $\\sigma(i) < \\sigma(j)$, and there are no inversions in this case.\n\nCase 3: $i < j \\le k$.\nIn this case, the action of $\\sigma$ is given by $\\sigma(i) = k - i + 1$ and $\\sigma(j) = k - j + 1$. We need to check the condition for an inversion, which is $\\sigma(i) > \\sigma(j)$.\n$$\nk - i + 1 > k - j + 1\n$$\nSubtracting $k+1$ from both sides gives:\n$$\n-i > -j\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\ni < j\n$$\nThis is precisely the condition we started with for the pair $(i, j)$. This means that for *every* pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $1 \\le i < j \\le k$, the pair forms an inversion.\n\nTherefore, the total number of inversions, $N$, is the number of pairs $(i, j)$ that can be chosen from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ with the condition $i < j$.
