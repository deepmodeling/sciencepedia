Once a permutation is expressed in this form, key properties like its order and sign become remarkably simple to calculate. This practice problem uses the hypothetical scenario of a data scrambler to illustrate how to determine the minimum number of operations to restore the original state and the permutation's parity, both of which are derived directly from the lengths of the disjoint cycles.
