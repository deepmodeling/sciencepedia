This composition is performed from right to left, meaning we first apply the permutation $\\beta$ and then apply the permutation $\\alpha$ to the result.\nThe product is $\\pi = (1 \\ 5 \\ 3)(2 \\ 6) (1 \\ 2 \\ 4)(3 \\ 5)$.\n\nWe determine the cycle decomposition of $\\pi$ by tracing the path of each element from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n1.  Start with element 1. Applying $\\beta$, we see that 1 is mapped to 2, i.e., $1 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 2$. Now, applying $\\alpha$ to this result, we see that 2 is mapped to 6, i.e., $2 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 6$. Combining these, the net effect on 1 is $1 \\to 6$.\n\n2.  Next, trace element 6. The permutation $\\beta$ does not contain 6 in its cycles, so it fixes 6, i.e., $6 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 6$.

The net effect is $5 \\to 1$. This closes the cycle we started with 1.\n\nSo far, we have found the cycle $(1 \\ 6 \\ 2 \\ 4 \\ 5)$.\n\nLet's check the remaining element, 3. Applying $\\beta$, we have $3 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 5$. Applying $\\alpha$, we have $5 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 3$. The net effect is $3 \\to 3$. This means that 3 is a fixed point of the permutation $\\pi$.\n\nCombining these results, the disjoint cycle notation for the product $\\pi = \\alpha\\beta$ is $(1 \\ 6 \\ 2 \\ 4 \\ 5)$. Fixed points are typically omitted from the notation.\n\nThe final step is to find the inverse of this permutation, $(\\alpha\\beta)^{-1} = (1 \\ 6 \\ 2 \\ 4 \\ 5)^{-1}$. The inverse of a cycle $(c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \\dots \\ c_k)$ is obtained by writing the elements in reverse order: $(c_k \\ \\dots \\ c_2 \\ c_1)$.\n\nApplying this rule to our result:\n$$ (1 \\ 6 \\ 2 \\ 4 \\ 5)^{-1} = (5 \\ 4 \\ 2 \\ 6 \\ 1) $$\n\nThis is a valid disjoint cycle notation for the inverse. A cycle can be written starting with any of its elements. To write it in a more standard form, we can start with the smallest element, which is 1. Following the mapping from the reversed cycle $(5 \\ 4 \\ 2 \\ 6 \\ 1)$, we see that $1 \\to 5$, $5 \\to 4$, $4 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 6$, and $6 \\to 1$.
