This exercise moves to the larger group $S_4$ to explore what happens when the chosen generators do not span the entire group. [@problem_id:1621391]", "problem": "In abstract algebra, the structure of a group can often be understood by studying the subgroup generated by a small set of its elements.

Our goal is to identify this subgroup.\n\nFirst, we determine if the elements of $H$ have any special properties. A permutation is called even if it can be written as a product of an even number of transpositions (2-cycles). A $k$-cycle can be written as a product of $k-1$ transpositions. Therefore, a $k$-cycle is an even permutation if $k-1$ is even, which means $k$ must be odd.\nThe generators of $H$ are $\\sigma = (1, 2, 3)$ and $\\tau = (2, 3, 4)$. Both are 3-cycles. Since 3 is an odd number, both $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are even permutations.\n\nThe set of all even permutations in $S_n$ forms a subgroup called the alternating group $A_n$. In our case, this is $A_4$. Since the generators $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are both in $A_4$, any element of $H$ (which is a product of powers of $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$) must also be an even permutation. Thus, every element of $H$ is in $A_4$, which means $H$ is a subgroup of $A_4$. This can be written as $H \\subseteq A_4$.\n\nThis finding immediately eliminates option E, the full symmetric group $S_4$, because $S_4$ contains odd permutations (like $(1,2)$), which are not in $A_4$. It also eliminates option C, the dihedral group $D_4$. A common realization of $D_4$ as a subgroup of $S_4$ is the group of symmetries of a square with vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 in order. This subgroup contains permutations like the reflection $(1, 2)(3, 4)$ (even) but also reflections like $(2,4)$ (odd). Since $H$ cannot contain any odd permutations, it cannot be $D_4$.\n\nNow, let's determine the order of $H$, denoted $|H|$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group it is a part of. Since $H \\subseteq A_4$, $|H|$ must divide $|A_4|$. The order of $S_n$ is $n!$, so $|S_4| = 4! = 24$. The order of $A_n$ is $n!/2$, so $|A_4| = 12$. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. So, $|H|$ must be one of these values.\n\nThe group $H$ contains the element $\\sigma = (1, 2, 3)$, which has order 3. Thus, $|H|$ must be a multiple of 3. This narrows down the possibilities for $|H|$ to 3, 6, or 12.\nIf $|H|=3$, $H$ would be the cyclic group generated by $\\sigma$, i.e., $H = \\{e, (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2)\\}$. However, $H$ must also contain the generator $\\tau=(2,3,4)$, which is not in this set. So, $|H| \\neq 3$.\n\nThe possibilities for $|H|$ are now 6 or 12. Let's compute a new element in $H$ by composing the generators:\n$\\sigma\\tau = (1, 2, 3)(2, 3, 4)$\nTo compute this composition (applied right-to-left):\n- $1 \\to 1 \\to 2$\n- $2 \\to 3 \\to 1$\n- $3 \\to 4 \\to 4$\n- $4 \\to 2 \\to 3$\nSo, $\\sigma\\tau = (1, 2)(4, 3) = (1, 2)(3, 4)$. This element has order 2.\nSince $H$ contains an element of order 3 ($\\sigma$) and an element of order 2 ($\\sigma\\tau$), its order $|H|$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6. This confirms that $|H|$ must be 6 or 12.\n\nNow we must decide between $|H|=6$ and $|H|=12$. This depends on whether $A_4$ has a subgroup of order 6. Let's investigate this. Any subgroup of index 2 is a normal subgroup. If a subgroup $K \\subset A_4$ with $|K|=6$ existed, it would have index $|A_4|/|K| = 12/6 = 2$, and thus would have to be a normal subgroup of $A_4$.\nA subgroup is normal if and only if it is a union of conjugacy classes of the parent group. The conjugacy classes of $A_4$ are:\n- $C_1 = \\{e\\}$ (size 1)\n- $C_2 = \\{(1, 2)(3, 4), (1, 3)(2, 4), (1, 4)(2, 3)\\}$ (size 3)\n- $C_3 = \\{(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 2), (2, 4, 3)\\}$ (size 4)\n- $C_4 = \\{(1, 3, 2), (1, 4, 3), (1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 4)\\}$ (size 4)\nA normal subgroup must contain the identity class $C_1$. To form a subgroup of order 6, we would need to find a collection of these classes whose sizes sum to 6. Checking the possibilities: $1+3=4$, $1+4=5$. No combination of these class sizes sums to 6. Therefore, $A_4$ has no normal subgroup of order 6. Since any subgroup of order 6 would have to be normal, we conclude that $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6.\n\nSince $H$ is a subgroup of $A_4$ and $|H|$ cannot be 6, the only remaining possibility is $|H|=12$.\nWe have established that $H \\subseteq A_4$ and $|H| = 12$. As $|A_4|$ is also 12, the only way for this to be true is if $H = A_4$.\n\nTherefore, the subgroup generated by $\\sigma=(1,2,3)$ and $\\tau=(2,3,4)$ is the alternating group $A_4$. This corresponds to option D. Options A and B are ruled out as their orders are 4, which is not a multiple of 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1621391"}]}
