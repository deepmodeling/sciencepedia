The compatibility between any two sensors is determined by a relation on their assigned operating frequencies. The set of all possible frequencies is the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe engineering team has defined three fundamental properties a relation must satisfy to be considered \"robust\": Reflexivity (R), Symmetry (S), and Transitivity (T). A relation that satisfies all three is an equivalence relation. The team needs to analyze two proposed protocols, defined by relations $\\mathcal{R}_A$ and $\\mathcal{R}_B$, to determine which of these properties fail for each.\n\nThe relations are defined on the set of frequencies $\\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n\n1.  **Protocol A (Relation $\\mathcal{R}_A$):** Two frequencies $f_1, f_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are related, written $f_1 \\mathcal{R}_A f_2$, if the absolute difference between them is no more than a fixed positive tolerance $\\Delta > 0$. Formally: $f_1 \\mathcal{R}_A f_2 \\iff |f_1 - f_2| \\le \\Delta$.\n\n2.  **Protocol B (Relation $\\mathcal{R}_B$):** Two frequencies $f_1, f_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are related, written $f_1 \\mathcal{R}_B f_2$, if their product is strictly positive, or if both frequencies are zero. Formally: $f_1 \\mathcal{R}_B f_2 \\iff (f_1 f_2 > 0) \\lor (f_1 = 0 \\land f_2 = 0)$.\n\nFor each protocol, determine the set of properties (Reflexivity, Symmetry, Transitivity) that it fails to satisfy. Let $F(\\mathcal{R})$ be the set of failed properties for a given relation $\\mathcal{R}$. Choose the option that correctly identifies both $F(\\mathcal{R}_A)$ and $F(\\mathcal{R}_B)$.

Consider two cases.\nIf $f_{2} \\neq 0$, then $f_{1} \\neq 0$ and $f_{3} \\neq 0$ (since $f_{1} f_{2} > 0$ and $f_{2} f_{3} > 0$). Multiplying the inequalities gives $(f_{1} f_{2})(f_{2} f_{3}) > 0$, hence $f_{1} f_{2}^{2} f_{3} > 0$. Because $f_{2}^{2} > 0$, it follows that $f_{1} f_{3} > 0$, so $f_{1} \\mathcal{R}_{B} f_{3}$.\nIf $f_{2} = 0$, then $f_{1} \\mathcal{R}_{B} f_{2}$ implies $f_{1} = 0$, and $f_{2} \\mathcal{R}_{B} f_{3}$ implies $f_{3} = 0$, hence $f_{1} = 0$ and $f_{3} = 0$, so $f_{1} \\mathcal{R}_{B} f_{3}$.
