The order of the group $G$ is the product of the orders of its component groups:\n$$|G| = |\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6| = |\\mathbb{Z}_4| \\times |\\mathbb{Z}_6| = 4 \\times 6 = 24$$\n\nNext, we need to find the order of an arbitrary element $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_6$.

This is achieved by finding elements $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_6$ that have the largest possible orders in their respective groups.\n\nLet's analyze the orders of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. The possible orders of elements must divide the order of the group, which is 4. So, the possible orders are 1, 2, and 4.\n- The element $0$ has order 1.\n- The element $2$ has order 2, since $2+2=4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n- The elements $1$ and $3$ have order 4, since $1 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ and $3 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ are the smallest positive multiples.\nThe maximal order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the orders of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_6$. The possible orders of elements must divide the order of the group, which is 6. So, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n- The element $0$ has order 1.\n- The element $3$ has order 2.\n- The elements $2$ and $4$ have order 3.\n- The elements $1$ and $5$ have order 6.\nThe maximal order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ is 6.\n\nTo find the maximal order $k$ in $G = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6$, we take the lcm of the maximal orders from each component group:\n$$k = \\text{maximal value of } \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(a), \\text{ord}(b)) = \\text{lcm}(4, 6)$$\nThe prime factorization of 4 is $2^2$ and the prime factorization of 6 is $2 \\times 3$.\n$$\\text{lcm}(4, 6) = 2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12$$\nSo, the maximal order of an element in $G$ is $k=12$.

A group is cyclic if and only if there exists an element (a generator) whose order is equal to the order of the group.\n- The order of the group $G$ is $|G|=24$.\n- The maximal order of any element in $G$ is $k=12$.\n\nSince the maximal element order (12) is less than the group order (24), there is no element that can generate the entire group. Therefore, the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6$ is not cyclic.\n\nIn summary, we have found that the maximal order is $k=12$ and the group $G$ is not cyclic.
