A nonempty subset $H \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if it is closed under addition and additive inverses, i.e., if $x,y \\in H$ imply $x+y \\in H$ and $x \\in H$ implies $-x \\in H$.

Let $H_{D}=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\operatorname{Re}(z)=\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\}=\\{t+it : t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. Since $0=0+i0$ belongs to $H_{D}$, we have $0 \\in H_{D}$.
