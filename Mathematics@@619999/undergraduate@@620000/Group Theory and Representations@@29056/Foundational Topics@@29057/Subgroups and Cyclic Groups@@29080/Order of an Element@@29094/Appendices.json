The order of a permutation is elegantly determined by the lengths of its disjoint cycles, involving the least common multiple. This problem [@problem_id:1633218] challenges you to think constructively: instead of finding an element's order, you must build an element of a specific order within the smallest possible symmetric group. This task is a beautiful blend of group theory and number theory, sharpening your problem-solving skills.", "problem": "In abstract algebra, the symmetric group on a set of $n$ elements, denoted as $S_n$, is the group of all permutations of those $n$ elements under the operation of permutation composition. The identity element in this group is the permutation that leaves all elements in their original positions.\n\nThe order of an element $\\sigma$ in a group is defined as the smallest positive integer $k$ for which $\\sigma^k$ is equal to the identity element.\n\nYour task is to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the symmetric group $S_n$ contains an element of order 14.", "solution": "Let $\\sigma$ be a permutation in the symmetric group $S_n$. To determine the order of $\\sigma$, we first write it as a product of disjoint cycles. Let the lengths of these disjoint cycles be $l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_m$. A key result in group theory states that the order of the permutation $\\sigma$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n$$\n\\text{ord}(\\sigma) = \\text{lcm}(l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_m)\n$$\nWe are looking for an element of order 14. Therefore, we need to find a set of cycle lengths $\\{l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_m\\}$ such that their least common multiple is 14.\n$$\n\\text{lcm}(l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_m) = 14\n$$\nA permutation consisting of disjoint cycles of lengths $l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_m$ acts on a set of $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} l_i$ distinct elements. For such a permutation to exist in $S_n$, the number of elements it permutes must be less than or equal to $n$. That is, we must have:\n$$\nn \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^{m} l_i\n$$\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible value of $n$. This means we need to find a partition of some integer into parts $\\{l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_m\\}$ such that $\\text{lcm}(l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_m) = 14$ and the sum $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} l_i$ is minimized. The minimum value of this sum $S$ will be the smallest integer $n$ for which such a permutation exists.\n\nThe prime factorization of 14 is $2 \\times 7$. For the lcm of a set of integers to be 14, the prime factorizations of these integers must only involve the primes 2 and 7. Furthermore, the highest power of 2 appearing in any of the factorizations must be $2^1$, and the highest power of 7 must be $7^1$.\n\nTo minimize the sum of the parts $l_i$, we should choose the parts to be the prime power factors that are required to form the lcm. In this case, to get an lcm of $14 = 2^1 \\times 7^1$, we need at least one length to be a multiple of 2 and at least one length to be a multiple of 7. The most efficient way to satisfy this while minimizing the sum is to choose the cycle lengths to be the distinct prime power factors themselves.\nSo, we choose the cycle lengths to be $l_1 = 2$ and $l_2 = 7$.\n\nLet's verify this choice:\n1.  The least common multiple is $\\text{lcm}(2, 7) = 14$. This satisfies the order requirement.\n2.  The sum of the lengths is $2 + 7 = 9$. This means a permutation consisting of a 2-cycle and a 7-cycle (for example, $(1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \\ 7 \\ 8 \\ 9)$) acts on 9 distinct elements. Such a permutation exists in $S_9$ and any $S_n$ with $n \\ge 9$. The smallest possible value for $n$ in this case is 9.\n\nLet's consider other possible sets of cycle lengths whose lcm is 14.\n-   A single cycle of length 14. Here, $l_1 = 14$. The lcm is 14. The sum of lengths is 14. This requires $n \\ge 14$.\n-   Any other combination of cycle lengths, such as $\\{1, 2, 7\\}$, would result in a sum of $1+2+7=10$, which is greater than 9. Adding more cycles of length 1 (fixed points) only increases the sum and thus the minimum required $n$.\n\nComparing the minimum values of $n$ required for each case:\n-   For cycle structure (14), we need $n \\ge 14$.\n-   For cycle structure (7, 2), we need $n \\ge 9$.\n\nThe smallest of these values is 9.
