The union of two distinct subgroups will fail the closure axiom, as the product of an element from $H \\setminus K$ and an element from $K \\setminus H$ cannot be in $H \\cup K$.\n\nB.

The claim is true only if the group $G$ is non-abelian. For all abelian groups, the union of any two distinct subgroups is also a subgroup.", "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate a student's claim: \"If $H$ and $K$ are two distinct subgroups of a group $G$, then their union, $H \\cup K$, can never be a subgroup of $G$.\"\n\nTo analyze this claim, we recall a fundamental theorem in group theory concerning the union of subgroups: The union $H \\cup K$ of two subgroups $H$ and $K$ of a group $G$ is itself a subgroup of $G$ if and only if one of the subgroups is contained within the other, i.e., $H \\subseteq K$ or $K \\subseteq H$.\n\nThe student's claim states that if $H \\neq K$, then $H \\cup K$ is never a subgroup. According to the theorem, this is equivalent to saying that if $H \\neq K$, then it must be that $H \\not\\subseteq K$ and $K \\not\\subseteq H$. This is the part we need to check. Is it possible for two subgroups to be distinct ($H \\neq K$) while one is still a subset of the other?\n\nYes, it is possible. This occurs whenever one subgroup is a proper subgroup of the other. For example, if $H$ is a proper subgroup of $K$, then by definition $H \\subseteq K$ and $H \\neq K$. In this scenario, the two subgroups are distinct, and according to the theorem, their union $H \\cup K = K$ is a subgroup of $G$. This provides a direct counterexample to the student's claim.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This option claims the student's assertion is always true. As we've reasoned, it is false. The argument given (about products of elements) is only valid when neither subgroup contains the other. It's not a general proof. So, A is incorrect.\n\nB. This option claims that $H \\cup K$ is always a subgroup. This is also false. A standard counterexample is the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_6 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ under addition modulo 6. Let $H = \\langle 2 \\rangle = \\{0, 2, 4\\}$ and $K = \\langle 3 \\rangle = \\{0, 3\\}$. These are distinct subgroups. Neither is contained in the other. Their union is $H \\cup K = \\{0, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This set is not a subgroup because it is not closed under the group operation; for example, $2+3 = 5 \\notin H \\cup K$. So, B is incorrect.\n\nC. This option links the claim to the order of the group. If $|G| = p$ where $p$ is prime, then by Lagrange's theorem, the only subgroups of $G$ are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ and the improper subgroup $G$ itself. These are distinct subgroups. Their union is $\\{e\\} \\cup G = G$, which is a subgroup. So the claim is false for groups of prime order. However, the claim is also false for groups of composite order, as we will see in the analysis of D. Thus, this option's condition is not accurate. So, C is incorrect.\n\nD. This option claims the student's assertion is false and provides a counterexample. Let $H$ be the trivial subgroup, $H = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. Let $K$ be any non-trivial subgroup of $G$ (such a subgroup exists if $|G|>1$). Since $K$ is non-trivial, it contains at least one element other than $e$, so $H \\neq K$. Thus, $H$ and $K$ are distinct subgroups. Now consider their union: $H \\cup K = \\{e\\} \\cup K$. Since $K$ is a subgroup, it must contain the identity element $e$. Therefore, $\\{e\\} \\subseteq K$, which means the union is simply $K$ itself: $H \\cup K = K$. By definition, $K$ is a subgroup of $G$. This is a valid counterexample that proves the student's claim is false. This option provides a correct analysis.\n\nE. This option links the claim to whether the group is abelian. The condition for the union of subgroups to be a subgroup ($H \\subseteq K$ or $K \\subseteq H$) does not depend on the group being abelian or non-abelian. Counterexamples exist for both types of groups. For the abelian case, the example in a) with $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ shows the union is not always a subgroup. For the non-abelian case, consider the symmetric group $S_3$. Let $H = \\langle (1 2) \\rangle$ and $K=S_3$. $H$ is a proper subgroup of $K$, so $H \\cup K = S_3$ is a subgroup, falsifying the student's claim for a non-abelian group. Thus, this condition is irrelevant. So, E is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D provides the most accurate and simple refutation of the student's assertion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1657764"}]}
