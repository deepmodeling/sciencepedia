A non-empty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup if and only if for any two elements $x, y \\in H$, the product $xy^{-1}$ is also in $H$ (one-step subgroup test). Alternatively, we can use the two-step subgroup test: $H$ is a subgroup if it is closed under the group operation and closed under taking inverses.\n\nFirst, let's establish the group operation and the form of the inverse in $G$. Let $T_{a,b}$ and $T_{c,d}$ be two elements in $G$. Their composition is:\n$$ (T_{a,b} \\circ T_{c,d})(x) = T_{a,b}(T_{c,d}(x)) = T_{a,b}(cx+d) = a(cx+d)+b = (ac)x + (ad+b) $$\nSo, the product is $T_{a,b} \\circ T_{c,d} = T_{ac, ad+b}$.\n\nThe identity element in $G$ is $T_{1,0}$, since $(T_{1,0} \\circ T_{a,b})(x) = 1(ax+b)+0 = ax+b = T_{a,b}(x)$ and $(T_{a,b} \\circ T_{1,0})(x) = a(1x+0)+b = ax+b = T_{a,b}(x)$.\n\nTo find the inverse of an element $T_{a,b}$, we need to find an element $T_{c,d}$ such that $T_{a,b} \\circ T_{c,d} = T_{1,0}$. This means $T_{ac, ad+b} = T_{1,0}$. By comparing the parameters, we get:\n$ac = 1 \\implies c = 1/a$\n$ad+b = 0 \\implies a(d)+b = 0 \\implies d = -b/a$\nSo, the inverse is $(T_{a,b})^{-1} = T_{1/a, -b/a}$.\n\nNow we test each subset.\n\n**A. $H_A = \\{T_{a,b} \\in G \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$**\nThis subset is non-empty (e.g., $T_{1,1} \\in H_A$). We check for closure under inverses. Let $T_{a,b} \\in H_A$, which means $a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The inverse is $(T_{a,b})^{-1} = T_{1/a, -b/a}$. For the inverse to be in $H_A$, its scaling factor, $1/a$, must be a non-zero integer. This is only true if $a=1$ or $a=-1$. If we choose an element with any other integer scaling factor, its inverse will not be in $H_A$. For example, consider $T_{2,0} \\in H_A$. Its inverse is $(T_{2,0})^{-1} = T_{1/2, 0}$. The scaling factor $1/2$ is not an integer. Therefore, $H_A$ is not closed under taking inverses and is not a subgroup.\n\n**B. $H_B = \\{T_{a,b} \\in G \\mid a \\in \\{1, -1\\}, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$**\nThis subset is non-empty (e.g., the identity $T_{1,0} \\in H_B$).\n1.  **Closure:** Let $T_{a,b}, T_{c,d} \\in H_B$. This means $a, c \\in \\{1, -1\\}$. Their product is $T_{a,b} \\circ T_{c,d} = T_{ac, ad+b}$. The new scaling factor is $ac$. Since $\\{1, -1\\}$ is closed under multiplication (e.g., $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$, $1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$, $(-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$), the product $ac$ will always be in $\\{1, -1\\}$. The new translation term, $ad+b$, is a real number. Thus, the resulting transformation is in $H_B$.\n2.  **Inverses:** Let $T_{a,b} \\in H_B$. The inverse is $(T_{a,b})^{-1} = T_{1/a, -b/a}$. If $a=1$, then $1/a = 1$. If $a=-1$, then $1/a = -1$. In both cases, the new scaling factor $1/a$ is in $\\{1, -1\\}$. The new translation term, $-b/a$, is a real number. Thus, the inverse is in $H_B$.\nSince $H_B$ is closed under the group operation and inverses, it is a subgroup of $G$.\n\n**C. $H_C = \\{T_{a,b} \\in G \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$**\nThis subset is non-empty (e.g., $T_{1,1} \\in H_C$). We check for closure under the operation. Let $T_{a,b}, T_{c,d} \\in H_C$. This means $b, d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Their product is $T_{ac, ad+b}$. For this to be in $H_C$, the new translation term, $ad+b$, must be an integer. However, $a$ can be any non-zero real number. For example, let $T_{\\sqrt{2}, 1} \\in H_C$ and $T_{1, 1} \\in H_C$. Their product is $T_{\\sqrt{2}, 1} \\circ T_{1,1} = T_{\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 1, (\\sqrt{2})(1)+1} = T_{\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}+1}$. The new translation term, $\\sqrt{2}+1$, is not an integer. Thus, $H_C$ is not closed under the group operation and is not a subgroup.\n\n**D. $H_D = \\{T_{a,b} \\in G \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\{0\\}, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$**\nThis subset is non-empty (e.g., the identity $T_{1,0} \\in H_D$ since $1,0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$).\n1.  **Closure:** Let $T_{a,b}, T_{c,d} \\in H_D$. This means $a, c \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and $b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The product is $T_{ac, ad+b}$. Since the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ form a field, the product of two non-zero rational numbers $ac$ is a non-zero rational number. Also, $a, d, b$ are rational, so $ad+b$ is also a rational number. Thus, the resulting transformation is in $H_D$.\n2.  **Inverses:** Let $T_{a,b} \\in H_D$. The inverse is $(T_{a,b})^{-1} = T_{1/a, -b/a}$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, its multiplicative inverse $1/a$ is also in $\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the quotient $-b/a$ is also in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, the inverse is in $H_D$.\nSince $H_D$ is closed under the group operation and inverses, it is a subgroup of $G$.\n\n**E. $H_E = \\{T_{a,b} \\in G \\mid a = 2^k \\text{ for some integer } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$**\nThis subset is non-empty (e.g., the identity $T_{1,0}$ is in $H_E$ for $k=0$ since $2^0=1$).\n1.  **Closure:** Let $T_{a,b}, T_{c,d} \\in H_E$. So $a = 2^k$ and $c = 2^m$ for some integers $k, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Their product is $T_{ac, ad+b}$. The new scaling factor is $ac = 2^k \\cdot 2^m = 2^{k+m}$. Since $k,m$ are integers, their sum $k+m$ is also an integer. So the new scaling factor is of the form $2^j$ for an integer $j$. The new translation term $ad+b = 2^k d + b$ is a real number. Thus, the resulting transformation is in $H_E$.\n2.  **Inverses:** Let $T_{a,b} \\in H_E$, where $a = 2^k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The inverse is $(T_{a,b})^{-1} = T_{1/a, -b/a} = T_{1/2^k, -b/2^k}$. The new scaling factor is $1/2^k = 2^{-k}$. Since $k$ is an integer, $-k$ is also an integer. So the new scaling factor is of the form $2^j$ for an integer $j$. The new translation term, $-b/2^k$, is a real number. Thus, the inverse is in $H_E$.\nSince $H_E$ is closed under the group operation and inverses, it is a subgroup of $G$.\n\nIn conclusion, the subsets that form subgroups are $H_B$, $H_D$, and $H_E$.
