A fundamental result concerning finite cyclic groups states that if $G$ is a cyclic group of order $n$, then $G$ can be decomposed as an internal direct product of two subgroups $H$ and $K$ if and only if their orders, $|H| = d_1$ and $|K| = d_2$, are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(d_1, d_2) = 1$, and their product is $n$, i.e., $d_1 d_2 = n$.\n\nFurthermore, for any divisor $d$ of the order of a finite cyclic group, there exists a unique subgroup of order $d$.
