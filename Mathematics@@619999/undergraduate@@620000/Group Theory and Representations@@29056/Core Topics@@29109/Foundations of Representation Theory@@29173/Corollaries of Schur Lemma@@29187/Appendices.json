Schur's Lemma for complex representations states: Let $\\rho: G \\rightarrow \\text{GL}(V)$ be a complex irreducible representation of a group $G$. If an operator $A: V \\rightarrow V$ commutes with all representation operators, i.e., $A\\rho(g) = \\rho(g)A$ for all $g \\in G$, then $A$ must be a scalar multiple of the identity operator, i.e., $A = \\lambda I$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nLet's analyze the consequence of an element $g_0$ belonging to the center of the group, $Z(G)$. By definition, the center of a group $G$ is the set of elements that commute with every element in $G$.\n$$Z(G) = \\{ z \\in G \\mid zg = gz \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\}$$\nSuppose $g_0 \\in Z(G)$. This means $g_0 g = g g_0$ for all $g \\in G$.\nNow, consider any representation $\\rho$ of $G$. Since $\\rho$ is a group homomorphism, it preserves the group operation. Applying $\\rho$ to the relation $g_0 g = g g_0$, we get:\n$$ \\rho(g_0 g) = \\rho(g g_0) $$\nUsing the homomorphism property, $\\rho(ab) = \\rho(a)\\rho(b)$, we can expand both sides:\n$$ \\rho(g_0) \\rho(g) = \\rho(g) \\rho(g_0) $$\nThis equation holds for all $g \\in G$. This means that the operator $\\rho(g_0)$ commutes with every operator $\\rho(g)$ in the image of the representation.\n\nNow, we bring in the condition that the representation $\\rho$ is irreducible. According to Schur's Lemma, any operator that commutes with all operators of an irreducible representation must be a scalar multiple of the identity. Since we have shown that $\\rho(g_0)$ commutes with all $\\rho(g)$ for $g \\in G$, it follows that $\\rho(g_0)$ must be a scalar matrix.\n$$ \\rho(g_0) = \\lambda_{\\rho} I $$\nfor some scalar $\\lambda_{\\rho} \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This holds for any irreducible representation $\\rho$. Therefore, if an element $g_0$ is in the center of $G$, its image in any irrep is a scalar matrix.\n\nNow, we must consider the converse. Suppose $\\rho(g_0) = \\lambda_{\\rho} I$ for every irrep $\\rho$. This means $\\rho(g_0)$ commutes with all matrices, and in particular, it commutes with $\\rho(g)$ for all $g \\in G$:\n$$ \\rho(g_0) \\rho(g) = \\rho(g) \\rho(g_0) $$\nAgain using the homomorphism property of $\\rho$, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\rho(g_0 g) = \\rho(g g_0) $$\n$$ \\rho(g_0 g (g g_0)^{-1}) = I $$\n$$ \\rho(g_0 g g_0^{-1} g^{-1}) = I $$\nThe element $c = g_0 g g_0^{-1} g^{-1}$ is the commutator of $g_0$ and $g$. The condition is that for every $g \\in G$, the commutator $[g_0, g]$ is in the kernel of every irreducible representation $\\rho$. The intersection of the kernels of all irreducible representations of a group $G$ is a normal subgroup. For a finite group (which is a common context, though not strictly required here), it's a known result that the intersection of the kernels of all irreducible representations is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$. More generally, if we can find a faithful representation (one with a trivial kernel), which can be written as a direct sum of irreducible representations, then we can conclude that being in the kernel of all irreps implies being the identity element.\nSo, we must have $g_0 g g_0^{-1} g^{-1} = e$ for all $g \\in G$. This simplifies to $g_0 g = g g_0$ for all $g \\in G$. This is precisely the definition of $g_0$ being in the center of the group, $Z(G)$.\n\nThus, the condition is equivalent to $g_0 \\in Z(G)$. Let's analyze the given options:\nA. $g_0$ must be the identity element of $G$. The identity element $e$ is always in the center, so $\\rho(e) = I$ is a scalar matrix. However, if $Z(G)$ is non-trivial, other elements also satisfy this property. So this is not the general condition.\nB. $g_0$ must belong to the commutator subgroup of $G$. The commutator subgroup is generated by elements of the form $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$, which is related to non-commutativity. This is essentially the opposite of the required property.\nC. $g_0$ must be an element of order 2. The order of an element is generally unrelated to whether it commutes with all other elements.\nD. $g_0$ must belong to the center of the group, $Z(G)$. As shown above, this is the correct and complete characterization.\nE. Such a non-identity element $g_0$ cannot exist. This is false. For any abelian group, $G=Z(G)$, so every element has this property. For a non-abelian group like the quaternion group $Q_8$, the center is $Z(Q_8)=\\{1, -1\\}$, so the non-identity element $-1$ has this property.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1610439"}]}
