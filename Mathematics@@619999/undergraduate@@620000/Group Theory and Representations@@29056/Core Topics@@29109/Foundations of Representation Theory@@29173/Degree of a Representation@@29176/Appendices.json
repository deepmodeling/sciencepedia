Substituting this value into the equation, we get:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} d_i^2 = 8 $$\nThe degrees $d_i$ must be positive integers.\n\nThe second piece of information is that the group $G$ is abelian. A key theorem in representation theory states that all irreducible complex representations of a finite abelian group are one-dimensional. This means that for every irreducible representation of $G$, its degree must be 1.\nSo, for all $i=1, 2, \\ldots, k$, we must have $d_i = 1$.\n\nNow we can substitute $d_i = 1$ into our sum of squares equation:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 1^2 = 8 $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 1 = 8 $$\nThe sum on the left is simply the number of terms, which is $k$.

In this problem, we are given that the group has $k=4$ conjugacy classes. Therefore, there must be exactly 4 irreducible representations. Let their respective degrees be $n_1, n_2, n_3,$ and $n_4$. This confirms that we are looking for a set of 4 integers, which all the options (except D, which contains non-integers) provide.\n\nSecond, the sum of the squares of the degrees of the irreducible representations of a finite group $G$ is equal to the order of the group, $|G|$. This is sometimes known as Burnside's formula or the sum of squares formula. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i^2 = |G|\n$$\nGiven that $|G|=12$ and $k=4$, we have the equation:\n$$\nn_1^2 + n_2^2 + n_3^2 + n_4^2 = 12\n$$\nwhere $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4$ must be positive integers.\n\nAdditionally, a crucial fact is that every group $G$ possesses a trivial representation, which is a 1-dimensional representation where every group element is mapped to the identity matrix [1]. Therefore, at least one of the degrees must be 1. Let's set $n_1 = 1$. Our equation becomes:\n$$\n1^2 + n_2^2 + n_3^2 + n_4^2 = 12\n$$\n$$\nn_2^2 + n_3^2 + n_4^2 = 11\n$$\nWe now need to find three positive integers whose squares sum to 11. Let's analyze the squares of small positive integers: $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$. Any integer greater than or equal to 4 will have a square greater than 11, so we only need to consider the integers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nWe can solve this Diophantine equation by inspection. Let's arrange the degrees in non-decreasing order, $n_2 \\le n_3 \\le n_4$.\n\nThe largest possible square less than 11 is $3^2=9$. Let's try setting $n_4^2 = 9$, which means $n_4=3$.\nThe equation becomes $n_2^2 + n_3^2 = 11 - 9 = 2$.\nThe only way to write 2 as a sum of two squares of positive integers is $1^2 + 1^2$.\nSo, we must have $n_2^2 = 1$ and $n_3^2 = 1$, which gives $n_2=1$ and $n_3=1$.\nThis gives a valid set of integers for $\\{n_2, n_3, n_4\\}$ as $\\{1, 1, 3\\}$.\n\nCombining this with $n_1=1$, the complete set of degrees is $\\{1, 1, 1, 3\\}$.\n\nLet's check if other possibilities exist. If we take the next largest square, $n_4^2 = 4$ ($n_4=2$), then $n_2^2 + n_3^2 = 11 - 4 = 7$. There is no way to write 7 as a sum of two integer squares (possible sums of two squares from $\\{1, 4\\}$ are $1+1=2$, $1+4=5$, $4+4=8$).\nIf we take $n_4^2 = 1$ ($n_4=1$), then $n_2^2 + n_3^2 = 11-1=10$. We can write 10 as $1^2+3^2$. This would give the set $\\{1, 3\\}$ for $\\{n_2, n_3\\}$. But this violates the non-decreasing order assumption $n_2 \\le n_3 \\le n_4$ (as we would have $\\{1, 3, 1\\}$). However, the set of degrees is unordered, so this simply recovers the same set $\\{1, 1, 3\\}$ for $\\{n_2, n_3, n_4\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible set of degrees is $\\{1, 1, 1, 3\\}$.\n\nNow, we check the given options:\nA. {1, 1, 2, 2}: The sum of squares is $1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10 \\neq 12$.
