This foundational exercise prompts you to investigate irreducibility by returning to its core definition: the absence of any non-trivial invariant subspaces. By directly testing for common eigenvectors of the group's generators [@problem_id:1611681], you will gain a concrete understanding of what makes a representation an indivisible \"atomic\" component of the group's structure.", "problem": "Consider the finite group $G$ generated by the two complex $2 \\times 2$ matrices\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\ 0 & -i \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nunder the operation of matrix multiplication. The group $G$ acts on the complex vector space $V = \\mathbb{C}^2$ in the natural way, where for any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$ and any group element $g \\in G$, the action is given by matrix-vector multiplication $gv$. This defines a 2-dimensional representation of $G$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes this representation?\n\nA. It is reducible and decomposes into the direct sum of two distinct 1-dimensional representations.\n\nB. It is reducible and decomposes into the direct sum of two identical 1-dimensional representations.\n\nC. It is an irreducible 2-dimensional representation.\n\nD. It is reducible but cannot be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations.\n\nE. The matrices $A$ and $B$ do not generate a finite group, so the concept of this representation is ill-defined.", "solution": "We analyze the group generated by\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad B=\\begin{pmatrix}i&0\\\\0&-i\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFirst, compute the powers:\n$$\nA^{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix}=-I, \\qquad B^{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix}=-I,\n$$\nso $A^{4}=I$ and $B^{4}=I$. Next, compute the conjugation relation:\n$$\nAB=\\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\\\-i&0\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad A^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad ABA^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}-i&0\\\\0&i\\end{pmatrix}=-B=B^{-1}.\n$$\nThus $ABA^{-1}=B^{-1}$ and $A^{2}=B^{2}=-I$ is central. It follows that the subgroup generated by $A$ and $B$ is finite; in fact, it has at most the eight elements\n$$\n\\{\\pm I, \\pm A, \\pm B, \\pm AB\\},\n$$\nand these are distinct since $A$ and $B$ do not commute (indeed $AB=-BA$). Hence $G$ is finite (isomorphic to the quaternion group of order $8$). Therefore, over $\\mathbb{C}$ (characteristic zero), Maschkeâ€™s theorem applies, so every representation of $G$ is completely reducible. This immediately rules out option D, and option E is false since $G$ is finite.\n\nWe now determine whether the given $2$-dimensional representation is reducible. A $2$-dimensional complex representation is reducible if and only if it has a nontrivial $1$-dimensional invariant subspace (a $G$-stable line). Any such line must be invariant under both $A$ and $B$.\n\nSince $B$ is diagonal, its eigenvectors are\n$$\ne_{1}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{with eigenvalue } i, \\qquad e_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{with eigenvalue } -i.\n$$\nThus the only $B$-invariant lines are $\\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}\\}$ and $\\operatorname{span}\\{e_{2}\\}$. Check $A$ on these lines:\n$$\nA e_{1}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\-1\\end{pmatrix}=-e_{2}\\notin \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}\\}, \\qquad A e_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}=e_{1}\\notin \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{2}\\}.\n$$\nTherefore, no $1$-dimensional subspace is invariant under both $A$ and $B$, so there is no nontrivial invariant line. Hence the representation is irreducible.
