By testing a specific line for invariance, you will see how a group action can move vectors out of a subspace, thus proving it is *not* a subrepresentation [@problem_id:1643703].", "problem": "Consider the dihedral group $D_3$, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle in the plane, centered at the origin.

For $W$ to be an invariant subspace (a subrepresentation), every element of $D_3$ must map any vector in $W$ to another vector in $W$. To show it is *not* a subrepresentation, we only need to find one group element $g \\in D_3$ and one vector $w \\in W$ such that $g \\cdot w$ is not in $W$.\n\nThe subspace $W$ is the x-axis, which can be represented as the set of all vectors of the form $(c, 0)$ for any real number $c$. A vector is in $W$ if and only if its y-coordinate is zero.\n\nLet's pick a non-zero test vector in $W$, for instance, the vertex vector $w_0 = (1, 0)$. We will now apply each of the transformations listed in the options to this vector and check if the resulting vector is still in $W$.\n\nFirst, we must confirm which of the transformations are indeed elements of $D_3$ for the given triangle orientation. The symmetries of an equilateral triangle with a vertex at $(1,0)$ are:\n1.  The identity ($e$).\n2.  Counter-clockwise rotation by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians ($r$).\n3.

The identity transformation.**\nThe identity transformation maps every vector to itself. So, for our test vector $w_0 = (1, 0)$, the identity transformation gives $e \\cdot w_0 = (1, 0)$. This resulting vector is still on the x-axis and thus is in $W$. The identity transformation does not demonstrate that $W$ is not a subrepresentation; in fact, it preserves the subspace.\n\n**C. Reflection across the x-axis.**\nThis transformation is an element of $D_3$ as it is a symmetry of the specified triangle. A reflection across the x-axis maps a vector $(x, y)$ to $(x, -y)$. Applying this to our test vector $w_0 = (1, 0)$, we get the vector $(1, -0) = (1, 0)$. The resulting vector is still in $W$. Like the identity, this reflection preserves the subspace $W$. Therefore, this transformation does not demonstrate that $W$ is not a subrepresentation.\n\n**D. Reflection across the y-axis.**\nA reflection across the y-axis maps a vector $(x,y)$ to $(-x,y)$. If we apply this to the vertex $(1,0)$, it maps to $(-1,0)$. If we apply it to the vertex $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$, it maps to $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$. This resulting point is not a vertex of the original triangle. Therefore, reflection across the y-axis is not a symmetry of the given equilateral triangle and is not an element of $D_3$. Since the question asks for a transformation *from* $D_3$, this option is invalid.\n\n**B. Counter-clockwise rotation by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians.**\nThis transformation is an element of $D_3$. The matrix for a counter-clockwise rotation by an angle $\\theta$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$. For $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, the matrix is:\n$$ R_{2\\pi/3} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) & -\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\\\ \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) & \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we apply this transformation to our test vector $w_0 = (1, 0)$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe resulting vector is $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$. The y-coordinate of this vector is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which is not zero. Therefore, this vector is not in $W$ (the x-axis).\nSince we have found an element of $D_3$ (the rotation by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$) that maps a vector in $W$ to a vector outside of $W$, we have successfully demonstrated that $W$ is not a subrepresentation.\n\nThus, the counter-clockwise rotation by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians is the correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1643703"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have a feel for what invariance means, let's develop a systematic way to find one-dimensional subrepresentations.
