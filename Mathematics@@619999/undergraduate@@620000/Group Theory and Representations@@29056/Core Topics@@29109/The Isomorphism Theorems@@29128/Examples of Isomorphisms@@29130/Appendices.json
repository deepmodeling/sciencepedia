{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding group isomorphism begins with the ability to identify the underlying structure of a given group and match it to a known prototype. This first practice focuses on this fundamental skill of classification. We will examine the group of units modulo 10, $(\\mathbb{Z}_{10}^\\times, \\times)$, a common example in elementary number theory. By investigating the group's order and the orders of its elements, we can determine its fundamental structure and see past its specific representation [@problem_id:1617121]. This exercise is key to developing the intuition that groups with different elements and operations can, in fact, be structurally identical.", "problem": "Consider the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}_{10}^{\\times}, \\times)$, which consists of the set of integers $k$ such that $1 \\le k < 10$ and the greatest common divisor $\\gcd(k, 10) = 1$. The group operation is multiplication modulo 10.\n\nTo which of the following groups is $G$ isomorphic?\n\nA. The additive group of integers modulo 4, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}_4, +)$.\n\nB. The Klein four-group, $V_4$.\n\nC. The symmetric group on 3 elements, $S_3$.\n\nD. The additive group of integers modulo 5, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}_5, +)$.\n\nE. The multiplicative group of units modulo 8, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}_{8}^{\\times}, \\times)$.", "solution": "By definition, $G=(\\mathbb{Z}_{10}^{\\times},\\times)$ is the set of residue classes $k$ with $1 \\leq k < 10$ and $\\gcd(k,10)=1$, under multiplication modulo $10$. The elements are exactly those integers relatively prime to $10$, hence\n$$\nG=\\{\\,1,3,7,9\\,\\}.\n$$\nThus $|G|=4$.\n\nTo determine the isomorphism type, compute the order of an element. Consider $3 \\in G$:\n$$\n3^{2}\\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}, \\quad 3^{4}=(3^{2})^{2}\\equiv 9^{2}=81\\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}.\n$$\nSince $3^{2}\\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ but $3^{4}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, the order of $3$ is $4$. A finite group of order $4$ containing an element of order $4$ is cyclic of order $4$. Therefore $G$ is cyclic of order $4$, and hence isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}_{4},+)$.\n\nThis matches option A. For completeness, we exclude the others:\n- $(\\mathbb{Z}_{5},+)$ and $S_{3}$ have orders $5$ and $6$, respectively, so they cannot be isomorphic to a group of order $4$.\n- The Klein four-group $V_{4}$ has every nonidentity element of order $2$, which does not hold in $G$ since $3$ has order $4$.\n- $(\\mathbb{Z}_{8}^{\\times},\\times)$ has order $4$ but is not cyclic; indeed $3^{2}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, and similarly for $5$ and $7$, so it is isomorphic to $V_{4}$ rather than to a cyclic group.\n\nHence $G \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_{4},+)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1617121"}, {"introduction": "The concept of isomorphism is not just for classification; it is a powerful computational tool. A fascinating example arises when we consider the set of isomorphisms from a group to itself, known as automorphisms. These automorphisms form a group under function composition, denoted $\\text{Aut}(G)$. For the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, this automorphism group is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of units $\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$. In this culminating practice [@problem_id:1617184], you will use this very isomorphism to simplify a calculation involving the composition of functions. This demonstrates how a deep structural understanding allows us to translate a problem from a more abstract setting (composition of automorphisms) into a more familiar one (multiplication of integers modulo $p$).", "problem": "Let $\\mathbb{Z}_p = \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$ be the cyclic group of integers under addition modulo a prime $p$.
