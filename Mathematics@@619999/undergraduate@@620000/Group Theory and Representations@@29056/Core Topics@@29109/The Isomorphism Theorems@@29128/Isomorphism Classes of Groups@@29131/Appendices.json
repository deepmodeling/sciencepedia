Isomorphic groups must have the same order, the same number of elements of any given order, and if one is abelian or cyclic, the other must be as well.\n\nFirst, let's determine the order of each group.\nFor $G_1 = U(15)$, the elements are integers coprime to 15. The integers from 1 to 14 coprime to 15 (since $15 = 3 \\times 5$) are $\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14\\}$. Counting these elements, we find that the order of $G_1$ is $|G_1| = 8$. Alternatively, we can use Euler's totient function: $|U(15)| = \\phi(15) = \\phi(3 \\times 5) = \\phi(3)\\phi(5) = (3-1)(5-1) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\nFor $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, the order is the product of the orders of its factors: $|G_2| = |\\mathbb{Z}_4| \\times |\\mathbb{Z}_2| = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\nSince both groups have the same order, $|G_1| = |G_2| = 8$, they could potentially be isomorphic.\n\nNext, let's check if the groups are abelian.\n$G_1 = U(15)$ is abelian because multiplication of integers (and thus multiplication modulo $n$) is a commutative operation.\n$G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a direct product of two abelian groups ($\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is always abelian). The direct product of abelian groups is always abelian.\nSince both groups are abelian, option E, which claims one is non-abelian, is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's investigate if the groups are cyclic. A group of order 8 is cyclic if and only if it contains an element of order 8.\nFor $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, the order of any element $(a, b)$ is given by the least common multiple of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(a, b) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(a), \\text{ord}(b))$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The maximum order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is 4, and the maximum order in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 2. Therefore, the maximum possible order in $G_2$ is $\\text{lcm}(4, 2) = 4$. Since there is no element of order 8, $G_2$ is not cyclic.\nTo check $G_1 = U(15)$, we can calculate the order of its elements. The maximum order of any element is 4 (e.g., the element 2 has order 4 since $2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15}$). Since there is no element of order 8, $G_1$ is also not cyclic.\nSince both groups are not cyclic, option A (\"one group is cyclic and the other is not\") and option C (\"they are both cyclic\") are incorrect.\n\nOur remaining options are B and D, which depend on the distribution of element orders.

It states that the groups are isomorphic because they are both abelian and have identical distributions of element orders. For finite abelian groups, having the same inventory of element orders is a sufficient condition for isomorphism. This is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which guarantees a unique decomposition into cyclic groups of prime-power order. Since both $G_1$ and $G_2$ are abelian groups of order 8 with a maximum element order of 4, their structure must correspond to the decomposition $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.
