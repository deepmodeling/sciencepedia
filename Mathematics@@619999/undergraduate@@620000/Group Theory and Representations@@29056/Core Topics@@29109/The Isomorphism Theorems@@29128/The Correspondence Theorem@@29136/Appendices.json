The Correspondence Theorem offers a powerful method for simplification by relating subgroups containing a normal subgroup $N$ to the subgroups of the quotient group $G/N$. This practice [@problem_id:1646740] demonstrates this principle by asking you to count the subgroups of $S_4$ containing the Klein four-group, $K$.

Since $K$ is abelian, for any $k \\in K$ and any $x \\in K$ we have $kxk^{-1} = x$, so $K \\subseteq \\ker(\\varphi)$. Moreover, the action is nontrivial: for example,\n$$\n(12)\\,(13)(24)\\,(12) = (23)(14),\n$$\nso $\\varphi((12))$ is a nontrivial transposition in $S_3$. In fact, one checks that the images of suitable transpositions in $S_4$ give distinct transpositions in $S_3$, so $\\varphi$ is surjective.
