It can be described using generators and relations. Let $r$ be the counter-clockwise rotation by $90^\\circ$ and $s$ be a reflection. The group $D_4$ is generated by $r$ and $s$ subject to the relations $r^4 = e$, $s^2 = e$, and $srs = r^{-1}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The eight distinct elements of $D_4$ are $\\{e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$.\n\nThe center of a group $G$, denoted $Z(G)$, is the subgroup of all elements $z \\in G$ that commute with every element $g \\in G$ (i.e., $zg = gz$ for all $g \\in G$).

The center $Z(D_{4})$ consists of all elements that commute with both $r$ and $s$.\n\nFirst, for $r^{k}$ to commute with $s$, use the relation $s r^{k} s = r^{-k}$, which implies $s r^{k} = r^{-k} s$. Thus $r^{k}$ commutes with $s$ if and only if $r^{k} = r^{-k}$, i.e., $r^{2k} = e$. Since $r$ has order $4$, this holds precisely for $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ and $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore $e$ and $r^{2}$ commute with $s$. Clearly, every $r^{k}$ commutes with $r$. Hence $e, r^{2} \\in Z(D_{4})$.\n\nNext, no reflection $sr^{i}$ lies in the center. Check commutation with $r$:\n$$\nr(sr^{i}) = (rs) r^{i} = (s r^{-1}) r^{i} = s r^{i-1}, \\quad (sr^{i}) r = s r^{i+1}.\n$$\nSince $r^{i-1} \\neq r^{i+1}$ in $D_{4}$, we have $r(sr^{i}) \\neq (sr^{i}) r$.

Using $r^{2} \\in Z(D_{4})$,\n$$\n(rZ(D_{4}))^{2} = r^{2} Z(D_{4}) = Z(D_{4}),\n$$\nso $rZ(D_{4})$ has order $2$. Also,\n$$\n(sZ(D_{4}))^{2} = s^{2} Z(D_{4}) = Z(D_{4}),\n$$\nso $sZ(D_{4})$ has order $2$.

Therefore the quotient is not cyclic of order $4$ and must be isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_{4}$. Concretely, it is an abelian group of order $4$ in which each nontrivial element has order $2$, which characterizes $V_{4}$ up to isomorphism.\n\nHence $D_{4}/Z(D_{4}) \\cong V_{4}$, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1637391"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into a fascinating and somewhat counter-intuitive property of quotient groups involving infinite structures.
