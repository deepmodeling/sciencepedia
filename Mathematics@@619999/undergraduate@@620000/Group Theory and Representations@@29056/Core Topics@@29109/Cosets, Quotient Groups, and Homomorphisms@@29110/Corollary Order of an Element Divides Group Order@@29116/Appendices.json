This problem challenges you to find all elements $x$ in a group $G$ that satisfy an equation of the form $x^k = e$. The solution requires a clever synthesis of two key ideas: that the order of $x$ must divide the group order $|G|$, and that it must also divide the exponent $k$. Mastering this technique is essential for developing algebraic problem-solving skills.", "problem": "Let $G$ be an arbitrary group with an order of $|G| = 21$. The identity element of this group is denoted by $e$. Consider the set $S$ containing all elements $x$ from the group $G$ that satisfy the equation $x^{10} = e$.

For any $x\\in G$, let $\\operatorname{ord}(x)=m$ denote the (finite) order of $x$, i.e., the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $x^{m}=e$. The fundamental property of orders states that for any positive integer $k$, $x^{k}=e$ if and only if $m$ divides $k$. Indeed, if $m\\mid k$, write $k=mt$ and obtain $x^{k}=(x^{m})^{t}=e$. Conversely, if $x^{k}=e$, write $k=qm+r$ with $0\\leq r<m$; then $e=x^{k}=(x^{m})^{q}x^{r}=x^{r}$, and by minimality of $m$ we must have $r=0$, hence $m\\mid k$.\n\nBy Lagrange’s theorem, $\\operatorname{ord}(x)$ divides $|G|=21$, so the only possible values are $\\{1,3,7,21\\}$.

While Lagrange's theorem tells us the order of an element must be a divisor of the group's order, does the reverse hold true? This thought-provoking exercise explores this crucial question, guiding you to investigate the limits of Lagrange's theorem and the important distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions. By testing these ideas, you will gain a more nuanced and accurate picture of the relationship between group order and element orders.", "problem": "In abstract algebra, the order of a group and the orders of its elements are fundamentally related. While Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any element must divide the order of the group, the converse is not always true; a group of order $n$ does not necessarily have an element for every divisor of $n$.\n\nConsider the set of all groups of order 20.

Since $5$ divides $20$, $G$ has an element of order $5$. Hence I is true. Equivalently, by Sylow’s theorems, the number $n_{5}$ of Sylow $5$-subgroups satisfies $n_{5}\\mid 4$ and $n_{5}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, forcing $n_{5}=1$, so a (normal) subgroup of order $5$ exists, hence an element of order $5$.\n\nFor II: Consider the dihedral group $D_{10}$ of order $20$. Writing $D_{10}=\\langle r,s \\mid r^{10}=s^{2}=e,\\ srs=r^{-1}\\rangle$, the rotations $r^{k}$ have order $10/\\gcd(10,k)\\in\\{1,2,5,10\\}$, and the reflections $sr^{k}$ have order $2$. Thus $D_{10}$ has no element of order $4$. Therefore it is not necessary that $G$ contain an element of order $4$, so II is false.\n\nFor III: Classify abelian groups of order $20$. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups and primary decomposition, any abelian $G$ with $|G|=20$ is isomorphic to\n$$\nC_{5}\\times C_{4}\\quad\\text{or}\\quad C_{5}\\times C_{2}\\times C_{2}.\n$$\nThe group $C_{5}\\times C_{2}\\times C_{2}$ has $2$-primary part $C_{2}\\times C_{2}$ of exponent $2$, so no element can have $2$-power order greater than $2$. For any element $(a,b,c)$, its order is $\\operatorname{lcm}(|a|,|b|,|c|)$, which is in $\\{1,2,5,10\\}$, never $4$. Hence there exists an abelian group of order $20$ with no element of order $4$, so the statement that every abelian $G$ must contain an element of order $4$ is false.\n\nFor IV: As shown, $D_{10}$ contains no element of order $4$, and so does $C_{5}\\times C_{2}\\times C_{2}$. Hence there exists a group of order $20$ with no elements of order $4$, so IV is true.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are I and IV only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1610933"}]}
