Instead of starting with a prime $p$ and examining powers, this problem gives you a polynomial, $f(a) = a^{13} - a$, and asks for its largest universal integer divisor [@problem_id:1618585]. The key is to rephrase the question using modular arithmetic: for which primes $p$ is it true that $a^{13} \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ for all integers $a$?

A positive integer $M$ is a universal divisor for $f$ if and only if $M \\mid f(a)$ for every integer $a$.\n\nFirst, we show $M$ must be squarefree. Suppose a prime $p$ satisfies $p^{2} \\mid M$.

Thus $v_{p}(f(p))=1$, so $p^{2} \\nmid f(p)$. Hence no $p^{2}$ can divide $M$, and $M$ is squarefree.\n\nTherefore, $M$ is the product of distinct primes $p$ such that $p \\mid f(a)$ for all integers $a$. We now characterize such primes $p$.\n\nFix a prime $p$. The condition $p \\mid f(a)$ for all integers $a$ is equivalent to the congruence\n$$\na^{13} \\equiv a \\pmod{p} \\quad \\text{for all } a \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\nThis is automatic for $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.
