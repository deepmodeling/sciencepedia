The first Sylow theorem guarantees that such a subgroup exists for each prime factor of $|G|$.\n\nOur first step is to find the prime factorization of the order of the group, $|G| = 1372$.\n\nWe can start by dividing 1372 by small prime numbers.\n$1372$ is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n$1372 = 2 \\times 686$\n\n$686$ is also an even number.\n$686 = 2 \\times 343$\n\nSo, $1372 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 343 = 2^{2} \\times 343$.\n\nNow we need to find the prime factors of 343.

Applying this to $A_{5}$, the theorem guarantees the existence of subgroups of orders $2^{2}=4$, $3$, and $5$. The number $15$ is not a prime power; it is $3\\cdot 5$. The Sylow First Theorem does not assert the existence of subgroups whose orders are products of distinct primes; therefore, the absence of a subgroup of order $15$ in $A_{5}$ does not contradict the theorem.\n\nOption A precisely captures this point: the theorem guarantees subgroups of prime power order only. Option B is false because groups can have subgroups of composite order, and primality of the subgroup order is not required in general. Option C is false because there is no contradiction with the Sylow First Theorem. Option D misapplies Lagrange’s Theorem; since $15$ divides $60$, Lagrange’s Theorem allows, rather than forbids, a subgroup of order $15$. Option E gives a correct Sylow-theoretic obstruction specific to $A_{5}$ (indeed, in $A_{5}$ the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups is $6$, not $1$), but the question asks why there is no contradiction to the Sylow First Theorem itself; that is answered directly by noting the theorem guarantees only prime power subgroups, not order $15$.
