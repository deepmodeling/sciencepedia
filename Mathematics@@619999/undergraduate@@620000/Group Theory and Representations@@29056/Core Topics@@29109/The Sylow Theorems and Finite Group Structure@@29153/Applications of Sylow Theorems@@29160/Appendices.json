We want to determine which of the given statements must be true for any such group $G$. To do this, we will use Sylow's Theorems, which provide powerful results about the structure of subgroups of a finite group.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the order of the group:\n$$|G| = 20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$$\nThe prime divisors of the order are $p=2$ and $p=5$. A Sylow $p$-subgroup is a subgroup whose order is the highest power of $p$ that divides the order of the group. So, for $G$, a Sylow 2-subgroup has order $2^2=4$, and a Sylow 5-subgroup has order $5^1=5$.\n\nLet $n_p$ denote the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$. According to Sylow's Third Theorem, $n_p$ must satisfy two conditions:\n1. $n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$\n2. $n_p$ must be a divisor of $|G|/p^k$, where $p^k$ is the order of the Sylow $p$-subgroup.\n\nLet's analyze the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, $n_5$.\nFrom Sylow's Third Theorem:\n1. $n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n2. $n_5$ must divide $\\frac{20}{5} = 4$.\n\nThe divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. We check which of these satisfy the congruence condition:\n- If $n_5 = 1$, then $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, which is true.\n- If $n_5 = 2$, then $2 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n- If $n_5 = 4$, then $4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nThe only possibility is that $n_5=1$. This means that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup in any group of order 20.\n\nA key property related to Sylow subgroups is that a Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal in $G$ if and only if it is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup (i.e., if $n_p = 1$). Since we have established that $n_5 = 1$ for any group $G$ of order 20, the Sylow 5-subgroup must be a normal subgroup of $G$. The order of this subgroup is 5.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options:\n\nA. $G$ is abelian. This is not necessarily true. For example, the dihedral group $D_{10}$ (the group of symmetries of a regular decagon) has order 20 and is non-abelian.\n\nB. $G$ possesses a normal subgroup of order 5. As we have just shown using Sylow's theorems, any group of order 20 must have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is therefore normal. This statement is necessarily true.\n\nC. $G$ possesses a normal subgroup of order 4. Let's analyze $n_2$, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (which have order 4).\n1. $n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n2. $n_2$ must divide $\\frac{20}{4} = 5$.\nThe divisors of 5 are 1 and 5. Both $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ and $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ are true. So, $n_2$ could be 1 or 5. If $n_2=1$, then there is a normal subgroup of order 4. However, if $n_2=5$, the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. Since it is possible for a group of order 20 to have $n_2=5$, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nD. $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$. Since $\\gcd(4,5)=1$, this group is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_{20}$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}_{20}$ is abelian. As established in option A, not all groups of order 20 are abelian, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nE. All elements of $G$, other than the identity element, have an order of 2, 4, or 5. By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any element of a finite group must divide the order of the group. For $|G|=20$, the possible orders of elements are divisors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. For example, in the cyclic group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_{20}$, the element 2 has order 10. Thus, this statement is false.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that is guaranteed to be true for any group of order 20 is that it possesses a normal subgroup of order 5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1777120"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just proving non-simplicity, the Sylow theorems can be a tool for the complete classification of finite groups of certain orders.

Let $n_p$ denote the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$. According to Sylow's third theorem, $n_p$ must satisfy two conditions:\n1. $n_p$ divides the index of the Sylow $p$-subgroup in $G$. Specifically, if $|G| = p^k m$ with $\\gcd(p, m) = 1$, then $n_p$ must divide $m$.\n2. $n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nA crucial fact connecting Sylow's theorems to the concept of simplicity is that a Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal in $G$ if and only if $n_p = 1$. A simple group, by definition, has no non-trivial proper normal subgroups. Therefore, for a group $G$ to be simple, it must be the case that $n_p > 1$ for all prime factors $p$ of $|G|$.\n\nLet's apply these theorems to our group $G$ of order 132.\n\n**Sylow 11-subgroups:**\nThe order of a Sylow 11-subgroup is 11. Here, $p=11$, $k=1$, and $m = 132/11 = 12$.\n$n_{11}$ must divide 12. The divisors of 12 are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$.\n$n_{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nFrom the list of divisors, only 1 and 12 satisfy this congruence. So, $n_{11} \\in \\{1, 12\\}$.\nIf $n_{11}=1$, the Sylow 11-subgroup is normal, and $G$ is not simple.\n\n**Sylow 3-subgroups:**\nThe order of a Sylow 3-subgroup is 3. Here, $p=3$, $k=1$, and $m = 132/3 = 44$.\n$n_3$ must divide 44. The divisors of 44 are $\\{1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44\\}$.\n$n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nFrom the list of divisors, the ones satisfying the congruence are 1, 4, and 22. So, $n_3 \\in \\{1, 4, 22\\}$.\nIf $n_3=1$, the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and $G$ is not simple.\n\n**Argument by Contradiction:**\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $G$ is a simple group. This assumption implies that $n_p > 1$ for all primes $p$ dividing $|G|$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n- $n_{11} = 12$\n- $n_3 \\in \\{4, 22\\}$\n\nWe can now count the number of elements in the group based on this assumption.\n\nA Sylow 11-subgroup has order 11, which is a prime number. Any two distinct subgroups of prime order can only intersect at the identity element. Thus, the 12 distinct Sylow 11-subgroups contain $12 \\times (11-1) = 12 \\times 10 = 120$ distinct elements of order 11.\n\nSimilarly, a Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3, which is also prime. Thus, any two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups intersect only at the identity.\n\nNow, consider the two possibilities for $n_3$:\n\nCase 1: $n_3 = 22$.\nIn this case, the 22 Sylow 3-subgroups would contribute $22 \\times (3-1) = 44$ distinct elements of order 3.\nThe total number of elements just from these two types of subgroups would be $120$ (of order 11) + $44$ (of order 3) = $164$.\nThis number, 164, is greater than the order of the group, $|G| = 132$. This is a contradiction. Thus, it is impossible for $G$ to have both $n_{11}=12$ and $n_3=22$.\n\nCase 2: $n_3 = 4$.\nIn this case, the 4 Sylow 3-subgroups contribute $4 \\times (3-1) = 8$ distinct elements of order 3.\nThe total number of elements accounted for so far is:\n- 120 elements of order 11.\n- 8 elements of order 3.\n- 1 identity element.\nTotal: $120 + 8 + 1 = 129$ elements.\n\nThis leaves $132 - 129 = 3$ elements in the group that we have not yet accounted for.\nNow, consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. The order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is $2^2=4$. Each Sylow 2-subgroup must contain the identity element and 3 other elements.\nThe only elements remaining in the group are the 3 we just counted. These 3 elements, together with the identity, must form a Sylow 2-subgroup. Since there is only one such set of 3 elements available, there can be only one Sylow 2-subgroup.\nThis means $n_2 = 1$.\nBut if $n_2=1$, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal. A normal subgroup would contradict our initial assumption that $G$ is simple.\n\nSince all possibilities for a simple group ($n_{11}>1$ and $n_3>1$) lead to a contradiction, our assumption must be false. Therefore, any group $G$ of order 132 cannot be simple. This means option B is correct.\n\nLet's briefly justify why the other options are not guaranteed to be true:\n- A. $G$ is a simple group: False, as we have just proven.\n- C. $G$ is an abelian group: False. The dihedral group $D_{66}$ has order $2 \\times 66 = 132$ and is non-abelian.\n- D. $G$ must contain an element of order 4: False. The Sylow 2-subgroups have order 4. A group of order 4 can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group $C_4$ (which has an element of order 4) or the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$ (in which all non-identity elements have order 2). The group $A_4 \\times C_{11}$ has order $12 \\times 11 = 132$, and its Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$, so it has no element of order 4.\n- E. $G$ has exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup: False. We only deduced $n_2=1$ under the specific assumption that $n_{11}=12$ and $n_3=4$. However, it is possible for a group of order 132 to have $n_{11}=1$. In such a group, we cannot make any conclusion about $n_2$ other than it must be odd and divide 33 ($n_2 \\in \\{1, 3, 11, 33\\}$). For instance, the group $D_{66}$ has $n_2 = 33$.\n\nThus, the only statement that must be true for any group of order 132 is that it is not simple.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1598501"}]}
