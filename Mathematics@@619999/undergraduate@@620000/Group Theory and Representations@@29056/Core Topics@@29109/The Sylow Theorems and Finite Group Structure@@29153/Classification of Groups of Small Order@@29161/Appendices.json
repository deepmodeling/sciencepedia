The set is closed under the group operation and contains inverses (each element is its own inverse), so it is a subgroup. Since these are the only three elements of order 2, this is the **unique subgroup of order 4**.\n*   **Order 6**: Let's test for the existence of a subgroup $H$ of order 6. If such a subgroup existed, its index in $A_4$ would be $|A_4|/|H| = 12/6 = 2$. A subgroup of index 2 is always a normal subgroup. If $H$ is normal, the quotient group $A_4/H$ would have order 2. For any element $g \\in A_4$, its coset $gH$ in the quotient group must satisfy $(gH)^2 = H$, which implies $g^2 \\in H$. Let's take an element $g$ of order 3, for instance $g=(123)$. Then $g^2 = (123)^2 = (132)$ must be in $H$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, if $(132) \\in H$, then its inverse $(123)$ must also be in $H$. This reasoning applies to all 8 elements of order 3. Thus, if $H$ existed, it would have to contain all 8 elements of order 3. This contradicts the assumption that $|H|=6$.

A subgroup is normal if it is closed under conjugation by all elements of the group. The non-identity elements of $V$ are all permutations with cycle structure (2,2). Conjugation preserves cycle structure. Since $V$ contains *all* permutations of type (2,2) in $A_4$, for any $v \\in V$ and $g \\in A_4$, the conjugate $gvg^{-1}$ must also be an element of type (2,2) (or the identity if $v=e$), and thus must be in $V$. Therefore, $V$ is a normal subgroup.\nThis statement is **TRUE**.\n\n**D. $A_4$ is a simple group.**\nA group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ and the group itself. We have just shown in (C) that $A_4$ has a normal subgroup $V$ of order 4. Since $\\{e\\} \\subset V \\subset A_4$, $V$ is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup. Therefore, $A_4$ is not a simple group.\nThis statement is **FALSE**.\n\n**E. All subgroups of order 3 in $A_4$ are conjugate to one another.**\nThe order of $A_4$ is $12 = 3^1 \\cdot 4$. The subgroups of order 3 are the Sylow 3-subgroups of $A_4$. The second Sylow theorem states that all Sylow p-subgroups of a finite group are conjugate to one another. Therefore, the four subgroups of order 3 are all mutually conjugate.\nThis statement is **TRUE**.\n\nThe only false statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1606532"}]}
