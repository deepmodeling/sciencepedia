In group theory, a subgroup of $G$ is called a Sylow $p$-subgroup if its order is the highest power of the prime $p$ that divides the order of $G$.

The highest power of $3$ dividing $|G|$ is $3^{1}$, so any Sylow $3$-subgroup $P$ has order $|P|=3$.\n\nBy the action of $G$ on its Sylow $3$-subgroups by conjugation and the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups equals the index of the normalizer of any Sylow $3$-subgroup.
