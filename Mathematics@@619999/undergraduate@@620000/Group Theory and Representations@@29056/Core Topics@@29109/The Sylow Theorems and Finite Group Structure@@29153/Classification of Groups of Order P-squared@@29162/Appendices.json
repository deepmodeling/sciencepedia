This exercise uses the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$ (where $p=5$) as a concrete example to investigate its subgroup structure. By applying the fundamental theorem of cyclic groups, you will see how the number and nature of subgroups are directly tied to the divisors of the group's order, a defining feature that contrasts sharply with the non-cyclic case [@problem_id:1606058].", "problem": "Consider the group formed by the set of integers $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 24\\}$ under the operation of addition modulo 25. This group is commonly denoted as $(\\mathbb{Z}_{25}, +)$. Your task is to determine the structure of this group by identifying all of its distinct subgroups. After identifying all subgroups, calculate the sum of their orders (i.e., the sum of the number of elements in each subgroup). Provide this sum as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the sum of the orders of all distinct subgroups of the additive group of integers modulo 25, denoted as $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the properties of the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$. It is a cyclic group of order $n=25$. The element 1 is a generator for this group, as every element in $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 24\\}$ can be obtained by repeatedly adding 1 to itself modulo 25.\n\nA fundamental theorem in group theory regarding the structure of finite cyclic groups states that for any finite cyclic group of order $n$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between its subgroups and the positive divisors of $n$. For each positive divisor $d$ of $n$, there exists a unique subgroup of order $d$. This subgroup is also cyclic. If the group is $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ (under addition), the unique subgroup of order $d$ is generated by the element $n/d$.\n\nTo find all the subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$, we must first find all the positive divisors of its order, $n=25$. The positive divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25.\n\nBased on the theorem, there are exactly three distinct subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$, corresponding to these three divisors. We can now determine their orders and identify them:\n\n1.  **Divisor $d_1 = 1$**: This corresponds to a subgroup of order 1. The only subgroup of order 1 in any group is the trivial subgroup, which consists solely of the identity element. In $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$, the identity element for addition is 0. So, the first subgroup is $H_1 = \\{0\\}$. The order is $|H_1| = 1$. This subgroup is generated by the element $25/1 = 25 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\n\n2.  **Divisor $d_2 = 5$**: This corresponds to a subgroup of order 5. This subgroup is generated by the element $25/5 = 5$. To find the elements of this subgroup, we take multiples of 5 modulo 25:\n    $H_2 = \\langle 5 \\rangle = \\{5 \\cdot 0, 5 \\cdot 1, 5 \\cdot 2, 5 \\cdot 3, 5 \\cdot 4\\}$ (all modulo 25)\n    $H_2 = \\{0, 5, 10, 15, 20\\}$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_2| = 5$.\n\n3.  **Divisor $d_3 = 25$**: This corresponds to a subgroup of order 25. This subgroup is generated by the element $25/25 = 1$. The subgroup generated by 1 is the entire group $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$ itself.\n    $H_3 = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 24\\} = \\mathbb{Z}_{25}$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_3| = 25$.\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the orders of all distinct subgroups. The three distinct subgroups have orders 1, 5, and 25.\n\nThe sum of these orders is:\n$$ \\text{Sum} = |H_1| + |H_2| + |H_3| = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31 $$\n\nThus, the sum of the orders of all distinct subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_{25}$ is 31.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31}$$", "id": "1606058"}, {"introduction": "Now we turn to the second possibility, the elementary abelian group, often denoted as $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$. This practice uses the group $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ (where $p=3$) to explore the profile of element orders, a key diagnostic tool. By directly calculating the order of each element, you will discover a fundamental property of these groups: no element has an order of $p^2$, which is the definitive characteristic distinguishing them from their cyclic counterparts [@problem_id:1606075].", "problem": "Consider the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$.

A key property of this group is that every element, other than the identity element, has an order of 7. What is the minimum number of elements required to generate the group $G$?", "solution": "Let $|G|=49=7^2$. By Lagrangeâ€™s theorem, the order of any element $g \\in G$ divides $|G|$, so the possible element orders are $1$, $7$, or $49$. The hypothesis states that every non-identity element has order $7$, so no element has order $49$. Hence $G$ is not cyclic.\n\nAny group of order $p^2$, with $p$ prime, is abelian. Indeed, let $Z(G)$ denote the center of $G$. For a $p$-group, $Z(G)$ is nontrivial. Thus $|Z(G)|$ is either $p$ or $p^2$. If $|Z(G)|=p^2$, then $G$ is abelian. If $|Z(G)|=p$, then $G/Z(G)$ has order $p$, hence is cyclic, and a group with cyclic quotient by its center is abelian; thus $G$ is abelian in either case.\n\nBy the classification of finite abelian groups, an abelian group of order $7^2$ is isomorphic to either $C_{49}$ or $C_7 \\times C_7$.
