Cauchy's Theorem guarantees the existence of an element of order $p$ for any prime $p$ that divides the group's order. Since 18 is not a prime number, the theorem is not applicable to the number 18.\n\nB. The observation must be incorrect. For any finite abelian group, the converse of Lagrange's Theorem holds, meaning that for any divisor $d$ of the group's order, there must exist an element of order $d$. Since 18 divides 36, an element of order 18 must exist.\n\nC. Cauchy's Theorem only applies to cyclic groups.
