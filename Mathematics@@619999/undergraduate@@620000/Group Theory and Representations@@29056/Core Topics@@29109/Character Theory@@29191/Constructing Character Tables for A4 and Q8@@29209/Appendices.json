The assignment of these symbols follows a set of established conventions.\n\nConsider the rules for assigning the primary letter and its subscript for a one-dimensional IR:\n\n1.  **The Letter (A or B):** A one-dimensional representation is assigned the letter `A` if it is symmetric with respect to rotation about the principal axis of highest order, $C_n$. It is assigned the letter `B` if it is antisymmetric with respect to this operation. \"Symmetric\" corresponds to a character of +1 for the operation, while \"antisymmetric\" corresponds to a character of -1.\n\n2.  **The Subscript (1 or 2):** For representations labeled `A` or `B`, a subscript is added based on the character of a secondary symmetry operation. If the point group has any $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the principal $C_n$ axis, the character of one of these $C_2$ operations is used. If there are no perpendicular $C_2$ axes, the character of a vertical mirror plane, $\\sigma_v$, is used instead. A subscript of `1` indicates that the representation is symmetric (character = +1) with respect to this secondary operation, while a subscript of `2` indicates that it is antisymmetric (character = -1).\n\nSuppose you are analyzing a molecule belonging to a point group that lacks any $C_2$ axes perpendicular to its principal $C_n$ axis.

This practice introduces two important extensions for common, highly symmetric point groups.

For this point group, the coordinate axes are conventionally assigned such that the $z$-axis coincides with the principal $C_2$ rotation axis.

The vibrational mode is antisymmetric with respect to the inversion operation, $i$.\n2.  The vibrational mode is antisymmetric with respect to the $C_2$ rotation about the principal ($z$-) axis, $C_2(z)$.\n3.

The behavior (symmetric or antisymmetric) corresponds to the character of the irreducible representation for that operation (+1 for symmetric, -1 for antisymmetric).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the parity subscript (g or u)**\n\nThe Mulliken symbol subscript 'g' (from the German *gerade*, meaning even) or 'u' (from *ungerade*, meaning odd) is determined by the character with respect to the inversion operation, $i$.\n- A character of +1 (symmetric) under inversion leads to a 'g' subscript.\n- A character of -1 (antisymmetric) under inversion leads to a 'u' subscript.\n\nThe problem states that the vibrational mode is **antisymmetric** with respect to the inversion operation, $i$.\nTherefore, the character for this operation, $\\chi(i)$, is -1. This means the correct subscript is **u**.\n\nThis immediately eliminates options A, B, and C, which all have the 'g' subscript.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the main letter (A or B) and the numerical index**\n\nFor point groups like $D_{2h}$ which have three mutually perpendicular $C_2$ axes ($C_2(z)$, $C_2(y)$, and $C_2(x)$), the main letter and numerical index are determined by the characters of the representation with respect to these three rotation operations.

This means $\\chi(C_2(z)) = -1$.\n- The mode is **symmetric** with respect to $C_2(y)$. This means $\\chi(C_2(y)) = +1$.\n\nWe now have the characters for two of the three $C_2$ operations: $(\\chi(C_2(z)), \\chi(C_2(y))) = (-1, +1)$.\n\nComparing this pair of characters to the convention table:\n- A requires $(+1, +1)$, which does not match.\n- $B_1$ requires $(+1, -1)$, which does not match.\n- $B_2$ requires $(-1, +1)$, which is a perfect match.\n- $B_3$ requires $(-1, -1)$, which does not match.\n\nThe character pattern corresponds to a **B-type** representation with a numerical index of **2**.\nFor completeness, this implies that the character for the third rotation must be $\\chi(C_2(x)) = -1$.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results**\n\nFrom Step 1, the parity subscript is **u**.\nFrom Step 2, the numerical index is **2**.\n\nCombining these, the full Mulliken symbol for the irreducible representation is $B_{2u}$.
