This action gives rise to a permutation representation of $S_3$ on the vector space $V = \\mathbb{C}[X]$, the vector space over the complex numbers with the set of all colorings $X$ as its basis.\n\nCalculate the multiplicity of the two-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_3$ within the representation $V$.", "solution": "Let $\\chi_V$ be the character of the representation on the vector space $V$, and let $\\chi_{std}$ be the character of the two-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_3$.

The group $S_3$ has order $|S_3|=6$ and consists of three conjugacy classes:\n1.  The identity class $C_1 = \\{e\\}$, of size 1.\n2.  The class of 3-cycles $C_2 = \\{(123), (132)\\}$, of size 2.\n3.  The class of transpositions (2-cycles) $C_3 = \\{(12), (13), (23)\\}$, of size 3.\n\nThe multiplicity formula becomes:\n$$n_{std} = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} |C_k| \\chi_V(g_k) \\overline{\\chi_{std}(g_k)}$$\nwhere $g_k$ is a representative from class $C_k$.\n\nFirst, we need the character $\\chi_{std}$ of the two-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_3$. The values of this character on the conjugacy classes are well-known:\n-   $\\chi_{std}(e) = 2$ (the dimension of the representation).\n-   $\\chi_{std}((123)) = -1$.\n-   $\\chi_{std}((12)) = 0$.\nSince these values are real, $\\overline{\\chi_{std}(g)} = \\chi_{std}(g)$.\n\nNext, we must determine the character $\\chi_V$ of the representation on the space of colorings $V$. For a permutation representation, the character value $\\chi_V(g)$ is the number of elements in the basis set $X$ that are fixed by the action of $g$. The set $X$ consists of all $3^3 = 27$ possible colorings of the three edges.\n\n-   **For $g = e$ (identity):** The identity element fixes all colorings. The number of colorings is $3^3=27$. Thus, $\\chi_V(e) = 27$.\n\n-   **For $g = (123)$ (a 3-cycle):** This permutation cyclically permutes the three edges of the triangle. Let the edges be $e_1, e_2, e_3$. The action is $e_1 \\to e_2 \\to e_3 \\to e_1$. A coloring $f:\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ is fixed by $g$ if $f(e) = (g \\cdot f)(e) = f(g^{-1} \\cdot e)$ for all $e \\in \\mathcal{E}$. This implies $f(e_1)=f(e_3)$, $f(e_2)=f(e_1)$, and $f(e_3)=f(e_2)$. Therefore, all three edges must have the same color: $f(e_1)=f(e_2)=f(e_3)$. Since there are 3 available colors, there are 3 such monochromatic colorings. Thus, $\\chi_V((123)) = 3$.\n\n-   **For $g = (12)$ (a transposition):** This permutation swaps two vertices and leaves one fixed. This induces an action on the edges that swaps two edges and leaves one edge fixed. Let the edges be partitioned into orbits under the action of $g$: one orbit of size 2 (the swapped edges) and one orbit of size 1 (the fixed edge). A coloring is fixed by $g$ if and only if all edges within each orbit have the same color. We can choose one color for the two edges in the first orbit (3 choices) and one color for the single edge in the second orbit (3 choices). These choices are independent. The total number of fixed colorings is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.
