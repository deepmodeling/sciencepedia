This first exercise [@problem_id:1632251] presents a group using generators and relations, challenging you to first identify the group's elements and structure.

This group has a finite number of elements. How many non-isomorphic irreducible complex representations does this group $G$ possess?", "solution": "We are given a group $G=\\langle a,b \\mid a^{4}=1,\\ a^{2}=b^{2},\\ b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}\\rangle$. First, we analyze its structure.\n\nFrom $b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}$, compute the conjugation of $a^{2}$ by $b$:\n$$\nb a^{2} b^{-1}=(b a b^{-1})(b a b^{-1})=a^{-1} a^{-1}=a^{-2}=a^{2},\n$$\nso $a^{2}$ commutes with $b$. It trivially commutes with $a$, hence $a^{2}\\in Z(G)$. Also $a^{2}$ has order $2$ because $a^{4}=1$.\n\nUsing $a^{2}=b^{2}$, any word in $a$ and $b$ can be reduced to one of the forms $a^{i}$ or $a^{i} b$ with $i\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$: powers of $a$ reduce modulo $4$, and any occurrence of $b^{2}$ can be replaced by $a^{2}$ which is central, allowing consolidation. Therefore,\n$$\n|G|\\leq 8.\n$$\nDefine a map to the quaternion group $Q_{8}=\\{\\pm 1,\\pm i,\\pm j,\\pm k\\}$ by sending $a\\mapsto i$ and $b\\mapsto j$. In $Q_{8}$ one has $i^{4}=1$, $i^{2}=j^{2}=-1$, and $j i j^{-1}=i^{-1}$, so the given relations are satisfied. Hence there is a surjective homomorphism $G\\to Q_{8}$, implying $|G|\\geq 8$. Combining with the upper bound gives $|G|=8$ and $G\\cong Q_{8}$.\n\nNext, determine the conjugacy classes in $G$. Since $a^{2}\\in Z(G)$, both $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{a^{2}\\}$ are singleton conjugacy classes. The relation $b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}$ shows $a\\notin Z(G)$ and that $a$ is conjugate to $a^{-1}=a^{3}$, so $\\{a,a^{3}\\}$ is a conjugacy class. For $b$, compute conjugation by $a$:\n$$\na b a^{-1} = (a b) a^{-1} = (b a^{-1}) a^{-1} = b a^{-2} = b a^{2} = a^{2} b,\n$$\nusing $a b=b a^{-1}$ (equivalent to $b a b^{-1}=a^{-1}$) and centrality of $a^{2}$. Thus the conjugacy class of $b$ is $\\{b,a^{2} b\\}$. Similarly, the conjugacy class of $a b$ is $\\{a b, a^{3} b\\}$. Therefore $G$ has exactly $5$ conjugacy classes:\n$$\n\\{1\\},\\ \\{a^{2}\\},\\ \\{a,a^{3}\\},\\ \\{b,a^{2} b\\},\\ \\{a b,a^{3} b\\}.\n$$\nFor a finite group over $\\mathbb{C}$, the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations equals the number of conjugacy classes. Hence $G$ has $5$ irreducible complex representations up to isomorphism.\n\nEquivalently, one can confirm the degrees by using the class equation for character degrees. Compute the commutator:\n$$\n[a,b]=a b a^{-1} b^{-1} = (b a^{-1}) a^{-1} b^{-1} = b a^{-2} b^{-1} = a^{2},\n$$\nso the derived subgroup is $\\langle a^{2}\\rangle$ of order $2$, and the abelianization has order $4$. Thus there are $4$ one-dimensional representations. The sum of squares of irreducible degrees equals $|G|=8$, so if $n_{1}$ is the number of $1$-dimensional irreducibles and the remaining degrees are $d_{i}$, then\n$$\n4\\cdot 1^{2} + \\sum d_{i}^{2} = 8 \\implies \\sum d_{i}^{2} = 4,\n$$\nforcing exactly one additional irreducible of degree $2$.

This problem [@problem_id:1632277] will guide you through using the class equation, a powerful structural constraint in finite group theory.

The distinct, fundamental modes of vibration or electron energy levels, which are crucial for understanding properties like spectroscopy and conductivity, correspond to the set of non-isomorphic irreducible representations of this symmetry group.\n\nConsider a system whose symmetries are described by a specific non-abelian group $G$ of order 21. Determine the total number of distinct non-isomorphic irreducible representations for this group $G$.", "solution": "The central theorem of representation theory for finite groups states that the number of distinct non-isomorphic irreducible representations of a group $G$ is equal to the number of its conjugacy classes. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of conjugacy classes of a non-abelian group $G$ of order 21.\n\nWe can determine the number of conjugacy classes by using the class equation for a finite group $G$:\n$$|G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{i} [G:C_G(x_i)]$$\nwhere $Z(G)$ is the center of the group, $x_i$ are representatives from each conjugacy class not in the center, and $[G:C_G(x_i)]$ is the size of the conjugacy class containing $x_i$, with $C_G(x_i)$ being the centralizer of $x_i$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the size of the center, $|Z(G)|$. The center $Z(G)$ is a subgroup of $G$, so its order must divide $|G|=21$. The possible orders are 1, 3, 7, and 21.\nIf $|Z(G)|=21$, then $G=Z(G)$, which means $G$ is abelian. This contradicts the problem statement.\nIf $|Z(G)|=3$, the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ has order $|G|/|Z(G)| = 21/3 = 7$. Since 7 is a prime number, any group of order 7 is cyclic. A known theorem states that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ must be abelian. This again contradicts the problem statement.\nIf $|Z(G)|=7$, the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ has order $|G|/|Z(G)| = 21/7 = 3$. Since 3 is a prime number, this quotient group is also cyclic, implying $G$ is abelian. This is also a contradiction.\nTherefore, the only possibility is that $|Z(G)|=1$. The center of $G$ is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element, $\\{e\\}$.\n\nNow, the class equation becomes:\n$$21 = 1 + \\sum_{i} [G:C_G(x_i)]$$\nThe size of any conjugacy class, $k_i = [G:C_G(x_i)] = |G|/|C_G(x_i)|$, must be an integer that divides the order of the group, $|G|=21$. Also, since we are summing over classes not in the center, $k_i > 1$. The possible values for the sizes of the non-trivial conjugacy classes are 3 and 7.\n\nLet $n_3$ be the number of conjugacy classes of size 3, and $n_7$ be the number of conjugacy classes of size 7. The sum of the sizes of all non-trivial conjugacy classes must be equal to $|G| - |Z(G)| = 21 - 1 = 20$. This gives us a Diophantine equation:\n$$3n_3 + 7n_7 = 20$$\nwhere $n_3$ and $n_7$ must be non-negative integers.\n\nWe can find the solutions by testing values for $n_7$:\n- If $n_7 = 0$, then $3n_3 = 20$. This has no integer solution for $n_3$.\n- If $n_7 = 1$, then $3n_3 = 20 - 7 = 13$. This has no integer solution for $n_3$.\n- If $n_7 = 2$, then $3n_3 = 20 - 14 = 6$. This gives $n_3 = 2$. This is a valid integer solution.\n- If $n_7 \\ge 3$, then $7n_7 \\ge 21$, which is greater than 20. There are no solutions for $n_7 \\ge 3$.\n\nThe only non-negative integer solution is $n_3 = 2$ and $n_7 = 2$. This means that the group $G$ has 2 conjugacy classes of size 3 and 2 conjugacy classes of size 7.\n\nThe total number of conjugacy classes is the sum of the class of the identity element and the non-trivial classes:\nTotal number of classes = $1$ (for the class $\\{e\\}$) $+ n_3 + n_7 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nSince the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations is equal to the number of conjugacy classes, the group $G$ has 5 such representations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "1632277"}, {"introduction": "The link between a group's structure and its representations is a two-way street.

Equivalently, abelian groups have as many conjugacy classes as elements, so they would have $8$ irreducible representations, not $5$.\n\nTherefore, we can definitively conclude that $G$ is non-abelian. Among groups of order $8$, the two non-abelian isomorphism types are the dihedral group of order $8$ and the quaternion group $Q_{8}$. Both have exactly $5$ conjugacy classes (hence $5$ irreducible representations), so the given information does not distinguish between these two possibilities. Thus statements asserting isomorphism to a specific one of these (dihedral or quaternion) are not forced.\n\nConsequently, the only statement that can be definitively concluded is that $G$ is non-abelian.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1632263"}]}
