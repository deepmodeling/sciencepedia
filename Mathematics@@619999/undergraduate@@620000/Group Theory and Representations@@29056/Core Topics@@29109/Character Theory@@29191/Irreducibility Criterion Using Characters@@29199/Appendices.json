A character $\\chi$ is irreducible if and only if its inner product with itself is equal to 1:\n$$\n\\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle = 1\n$$\nMore generally, if $\\chi$ is any character (reducible or not), it can be decomposed into a sum of irreducible characters $\\chi_i$ of $G$:\n$$\n\\chi = \\sum_{i} n_i \\chi_i\n$$\nwhere $n_i$ are non-negative integers representing the multiplicity of each irreducible character $\\chi_i$ in the decomposition. Using the property that the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis, i.e., $\\langle \\chi_i, \\chi_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, the inner product of $\\chi$ with itself becomes:\n$$\n\\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i} n_i \\chi_i, \\sum_{j} n_j \\chi_j \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i,j} n_i n_j \\langle \\chi_i, \\chi_j \\rangle = \\sum_{i} n_i^2\n$$\nSince each $n_i$ is an integer, the sum of their squares, $\\sum_{i} n_i^2$, must also be an integer.

This is false, because for an irreducible character, we must have $\\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle = 1$. Our result is $1/6$.\nB. The function $\\chi$ is a character of $G$, and it is reducible. This is false. If it were a reducible character, $\\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle = \\sum_i n_i^2$ would be an integer greater than 1. Our result $1/6$ is not an integer.\nC. The function $\\chi$ is a character of $G$, but it is impossible to determine its reducibility. This is false. We have determined that it is not a character at all, and this conclusion did not require any further information about $G$.\nD. The function $\\chi$ is not a character of any representation of $G$. This is true, as demonstrated by the fact that $\\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle$ is not an integer.\nE. The function $\\chi$ is the character of the regular representation of $G$. This is false.
