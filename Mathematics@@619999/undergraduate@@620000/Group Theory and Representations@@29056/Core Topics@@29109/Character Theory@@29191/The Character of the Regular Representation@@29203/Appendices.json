This is a standard theorem in representation theory: A finite group $G$ has all its irreducible representations of dimension one if and only if $G$ is an abelian group.\n\nLet's briefly see why. The sum of the squares of the dimensions of the irreducible representations equals the order of the group: $\\sum_i d_i^2 = |G|$. The number of irreducible representations is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$. If $G$ is abelian, each element is its own conjugacy class, so there are $|G|$ conjugacy classes and thus $|G|$ irreducible representations. The equation becomes $\\sum_{i=1}^{|G|} d_i^2 = |G|$. Since each $d_i$ is a positive integer, the only solution is $d_i=1$ for all $i$. Conversely, if all $d_i=1$, then there must be $|G|$ irreducible representations, which means there are $|G|$ conjugacy classes, which in turn implies $G$ is abelian.\n\nTherefore, the condition for $\\Psi = \\chi_{\\text{reg}}$ is that $G$ must be an abelian group.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $G$ must be a cyclic group. All cyclic groups are abelian, so this condition works. However, there exist abelian groups that are not cyclic (e.g., the Klein-four group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$). For these non-cyclic abelian groups, all irreducible representations are also 1-D, so the condition holds. Thus, \"cyclic\" is too restrictive; \"abelian\" is more general.\n\nB. $G$ must be an abelian group. As shown above, this is the correct necessary and sufficient condition.\n\nC. $G$ must be a simple group. A non-abelian simple group (e.g., $A_5$) must have at least one irreducible representation of dimension greater than one. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. $G$ must be a solvable group. While all abelian groups are solvable, not all solvable groups are abelian. For example, the symmetric group $S_3$ is solvable but not abelian, and it has a 2-dimensional irreducible representation. So, this condition is not sufficient.\n\nE. $G$ must be a p-group. Not all p-groups are abelian. For example, the quaternion group $Q_8$ is a p-group (with order $2^3$) but is non-abelian and has a 2-dimensional irreducible representation.\n\nThe most general and correct condition is that $G$ must be abelian.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1646183"}]}
