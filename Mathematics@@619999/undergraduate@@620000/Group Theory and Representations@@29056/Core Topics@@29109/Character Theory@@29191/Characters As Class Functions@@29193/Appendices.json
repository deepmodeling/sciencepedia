Characters of representations are notable examples of class functions.\n\nLet $D_4$ be the dihedral group of order 8, representing the symmetries of a square. $D_4$ can be described by generators and relations as $D_4 = \\langle r, s \\mid r^4=e, s^2=e, srs=r^{-1} \\rangle$, where $e$ is the identity element, $r$ corresponds to a rotation by $\\pi/2$, and $s$ corresponds to a reflection.
