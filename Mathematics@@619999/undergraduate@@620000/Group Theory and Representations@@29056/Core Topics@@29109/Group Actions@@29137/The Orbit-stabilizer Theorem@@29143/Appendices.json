Information is encoded by attaching a specific chemical marker to one of the molecule's six chemical bonds, which correspond to the six edges of the tetrahedron.

A \"stable configuration\" for a marked bond is one where a rotational symmetry of the entire molecule leaves the marked bond in its original position (though the two vertices forming the bond might be swapped).\n\nThe group $G$ of all possible rotational symmetries of this tetrahedral molecule is known to have a size of $|G| = 12$. The set $S$ on which this group acts is the set of the six edges of the tetrahedron.
