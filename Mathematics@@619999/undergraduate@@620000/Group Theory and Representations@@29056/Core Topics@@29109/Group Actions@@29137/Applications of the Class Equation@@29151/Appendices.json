This final practice moves beyond simple arithmetic into the realm of structural proof. You will need to combine the class equation with key theorems about the center of a group, $Z(G)$, to uniquely determine the entire partition of conjugacy class sizes for any non-abelian group of order 14, demonstrating how the class equation serves as a formidable tool for exploring the internal landscape of finite groups [@problem_id:1598761].", "problem": "Consider a finite group $G$ that is non-abelian and has an order of $|G|=14$.

Provide the complete list of these integers, including all multiplicities, sorted in ascending order.", "solution": "The problem asks for the sizes of the conjugacy classes of a non-abelian group $G$ with order $|G| = 14$.\n\nThe class equation for a finite group $G$ is given by:\n$$|G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{i} [G:C_G(x_i)]$$\nwhere $Z(G)$ is the center of the group, and the sum is taken over a set of representatives $x_i$ for each conjugacy class not contained in the center. The term $[G:C_G(x_i)]$ is the size of the conjugacy class of $x_i$, which is the index of its centralizer $C_G(x_i)$.\n\nWe are given $|G|=14$. A fundamental property related to the class equation is that the size of any conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. Therefore, the possible sizes for any conjugacy class of $G$ are the divisors of 14, which are 1, 2, 7, and 14.\n\nNext, we determine the size of the center, $|Z(G)|$. The center is the union of all conjugacy classes of size 1. Since the identity element $e$ always forms a conjugacy class of size 1, we know $|Z(G)| \\ge 1$. Also, as a subgroup, the order of the center $|Z(G)|$ must divide the order of the group, $|G|=14$. Thus, $|Z(G)|$ could be 1, 2, 7, or 14.\n\nWe can analyze these possibilities:\n1.  If $|Z(G)|=14$, then $G=Z(G)$, which means $G$ is an abelian group. This contradicts the given information that $G$ is non-abelian.\n2.  If $|Z(G)|=7$, the order of the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ would be $|G|/|Z(G)| = 14/7 = 2$. Any group of prime order is cyclic. There is a theorem that states if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ must be abelian. This again contradicts the non-abelian nature of $G$.\n3.  If $|Z(G)|=2$, the order of the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ would be $|G|/|Z(G)| = 14/2 = 7$. Since 7 is a prime number, $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic. As in the previous case, this implies that $G$ must be abelian, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is $|Z(G)|=1$. This means the group has a trivial center, and there is exactly one conjugacy class of size 1, which is the class of the identity element.\n\nNow we can write the class equation as:\n$$14 = 1 + \\sum_{i} c_i$$\nwhere the sum is over the sizes of the non-central conjugacy classes. The sum of these sizes must be $14 - 1 = 13$.\n$$ \\sum_{i} c_i = 13 $$\nEach size $c_i$ must be a divisor of 14, and since these are non-central classes, their size must be greater than 1. So, the possible values for $c_i$ are 2, 7, and 14.\n\nWe need to find a combination of these values that sums to 13.\nLet $a$ be the number of classes of size 2, $b$ be the number of classes of size 7, and $c$ be the number of classes of size 14. We must solve the Diophantine equation:\n$$2a + 7b + 14c = 13$$\nfor non-negative integers $a, b, c$.\n\n-   If $c \\ge 1$, then $14c \\ge 14$, which is already greater than 13. So, we must have $c=0$.\n-   The equation simplifies to $2a + 7b = 13$.\n-   If $b \\ge 2$, then $7b \\ge 14$, which is greater than 13. So, $b$ can only be 0 or 1.\n-   Case 1: $b=0$. The equation becomes $2a = 13$. This has no integer solution for $a$.\n-   Case 2: $b=1$. The equation becomes $2a + 7(1) = 13$, which gives $2a = 6$, so $a = 3$.\n\nThis gives a unique solution: $a=3, b=1, c=0$. This means there are three conjugacy classes of size 2 and one conjugacy class of size 7.\n\nSo, the full list of conjugacy class sizes is one class of size 1 (the center), three classes of size 2, and one class of size 7.\nThe class equation is $14 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 7$.\nThe list of the sizes of all conjugacy classes, sorted in ascending order, is 1, 2, 2, 2, 7.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1, 2, 2, 2, 7}$$", "id": "1598761"}]}
