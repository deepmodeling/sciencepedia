The elements $a$ and $b$ must *not* be in the same conjugacy class. Two elements $x, y$ are in the same conjugacy class if there exists an element $g \\in G$ such that $y = gxg^{-1}$.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. The group is the Dihedral group $D_4$, with elements $a = r^2$ and $b = r$.**\nThe Dihedral group $D_4$ is the group of symmetries of a square, generated by a rotation $r$ of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and a reflection $s$. Its elements are $\\{e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$ with the relations $r^4=e$, $s^2=e$, and $srs=r^{-1}$.\n1.  **Is $D_4$ non-abelian?** Yes, for example, $sr = r^{-1}s = r^3s \\neq rs$.\n2.  **Do $a=r^2$ and $b=r$ commute?** The elements $a$ and $b$ are both powers of $r$. The set of all powers of $r$, $\\langle r \\rangle = \\{e, r, r^2, r^3\\}$, forms a cyclic (and thus abelian) subgroup of $D_4$. Therefore, any two elements within this subgroup commute. Specifically, $ab = r^2 r = r^3$ and $ba = r r^2 = r^3$. So, $ab=ba$.\n3.  **Are $a$ and $b$ in the same conjugacy class?**\n    *   Let's find the conjugacy class of $a = r^2$. The element $r^2$ (a 180-degree rotation) is in the center of $D_4$, denoted $Z(D_4)$. This means $g r^2 = r^2 g$ for all $g \\in D_4$, which implies $g r^2 g^{-1} = r^2$. Thus, the conjugacy class of $r^2$ contains only $r^2$ itself: $C(r^2) = \\{r^2\\}$.\n    *   Let's find the conjugacy class of $b=r$. We conjugate $r$ by all elements of $D_4$.\n        *   For any rotation $r^k$, $r^k r (r^k)^{-1} = r$.\n        *   For any reflection $sr^k$, $(sr^k) r (sr^k)^{-1} = sr^k r r^{-k} s^{-1} = srs = r^{-1} = r^3$.\n        *   So, the conjugacy class of $r$ is $C(r) = \\{r, r^3\\}$.\n    *   Since $C(r^2) = \\{r^2\\}$ and $C(r) = \\{r, r^3\\}$, the elements $a=r^2$ and $b=r$ are not in the same conjugacy class.\nThis option satisfies all three conditions. Thus, it is a valid counterexample.\n\n**B. The group is the Symmetric group $S_3$, with elements $a = (123)$ and $b = (132)$.**\n$S_3$ is non-abelian. The elements are $a=(123)$ and $b=(132)$.\n1.  **Do they commute?** $ab = (123)(132) = e$ (the identity permutation). $ba = (132)(123) = e$. Yes, they commute.\n2.  **Are they in the same conjugacy class?** Two elements in $S_n$ are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle structure. Both $a$ and $b$ are 3-cycles. Therefore, they are conjugate. For example, let $g=(12)$. Then $gag^{-1} = (12)(123)(12)^{-1} = (12)(123)(12) = (132) = b$. Since they are conjugate, this is not a counterexample.\n\n**C. The group is any abelian group $G$.**\nThe proposition is explicitly about *non-abelian* groups. An abelian group cannot serve as a counterexample to a statement about non-abelian groups.\n\n**D. The group is the Symmetric group $S_4$, with elements $a = (12)$ and $b = (34)$.**\n$S_4$ is non-abelian.\n1.  **Do they commute?** Yes, since they are disjoint cycles, $ab = (12)(34) = (34)(12) = ba$.\n2.  **Are they in the same conjugacy class?** Both $a=(12)$ and $b=(34)$ are transpositions (2-cycles). Since they have the same cycle structure, they are conjugate in $S_4$. For example, let $g=(13)(24)$. Then $gag^{-1} = (13)(24)(12)((13)(24))^{-1} = (13)(24)(12)(13)(24) = (34) = b$. Since they are conjugate, this is not a counterexample.\n\n**E. The group is the Quaternion group $Q_8$, with elements $a = i$ and $b = j$.**\n$Q_8$ is non-abelian.\n1.  **Do they commute?** In $Q_8$, we have the relation $ij=k$ and $ji=-k$. Since $k \\neq -k$, $a$ and $b$ do not commute.\nSince the premise of Proposition P ($ab=ba$) is false, this cannot be a counterexample.
