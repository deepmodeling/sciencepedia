For any element $x \\in S_4$, the theorem states:\n$|S_4| = |\\text{Orbit}(x)| \\cdot |\\text{Stabilizer}(x)|$.\nIn this context, the orbit of $x$ is its conjugacy class, and the stabilizer of $x$ is its centralizer $C_{S_4}(x)$.\nSo, $|C_{S_4}(\\sigma)| = \\frac{|S_4|}{|\\text{Conj}(\\sigma)|}$, where $\\text{Conj}(\\sigma)$ is the conjugacy class of $\\sigma$.\n\nThe order of $S_4$ is $|S_4| = 4! = 24$.\n\nThe conjugacy class of $\\sigma = (1 2)(3 4)$ consists of all permutations in $S_4$ with the same cycle structure. The cycle structure of $\\sigma$ is a product of two disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions).

The remaining 2 elements will form the second transposition, which can be done in $\\binom{2}{2}$ ways.\n3. However, the order of the two transpositions does not matter, i.e., $(1 2)(3 4)$ is the same permutation as $(3 4)(1 2)$.
