Let $G$ be the cyclic subgroup of $H$ generated by the element $(1,1)$.\n\nA group action of $G$ on the set $X$ is defined as follows.

The total number of points in the set is $|X| = mn$.\n\nFirst, let's characterize the group $G$. It is the cyclic subgroup of $H = \\mathbb{Z}_m \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n$ generated by the element $(1,1)$. The elements of $G$ are of the form $k \\cdot (1,1) = (k \\pmod m, k \\pmod n)$ for any integer $k$. The order of $G$, denoted by $|G|$, is the order of the generating element $(1,1)$ in the group $H$. The order of an element $(h_1, h_2)$ in a direct product of groups $G_1 \\times G_2$ is the least common multiple of the orders of the individual components, i.e., $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(h_1), \\text{ord}(h_2))$.\nThe order of the element $1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ is $m$.\nThe order of the element $1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is $n$.\nTherefore, the order of the group $G$ is $|G| = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(1), \\text{ord}(1)) = \\text{lcm}(m,n)$.\n\nThe set $X$ is partitioned into disjoint orbits by the group action. If all orbits have the same size, say $S$, then the number of orbits is simply $|X|/S$. Let's determine the size of an orbit for an arbitrary point $(x,y) \\in X$.\nThe size of the orbit of $(x,y)$ can be found using the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, which states that $|\\text{Orb}_G((x,y))| = \\frac{|G|}{|\\text{Stab}_G((x,y))|}$.\nThe stabilizer of $(x,y)$, denoted $\\text{Stab}_G((x,y))$, is the set of elements in $G$ that fix the point $(x,y)$.\nLet $g \\in G$. Then $g = (k \\pmod m, k \\pmod n)$ for some integer $k$, where we can take $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, \\text{lcm}(m,n)-1\\}$. The condition for $g$ to be in the stabilizer is $g \\cdot (x,y) = (x,y)$.\nThis translates to the following system of congruences:\n$x = ((x-1+k) \\pmod m) + 1 \\implies x-1 \\equiv x-1+k \\pmod m \\implies k \\equiv 0 \\pmod m$.\n$y = ((y-1+k) \\pmod n) + 1 \\implies y-1 \\equiv y-1+k \\pmod n \\implies k \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$.\n\nFor $g$ to be in the stabilizer, the integer $k$ must be a multiple of both $m$ and $n$. This means $k$ must be a common multiple of $m$ and $n$. By definition, the smallest positive such integer is the least common multiple, $\\text{lcm}(m,n)$.\nThe elements of $G$ correspond to $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, \\text{lcm}(m,n)-1\\}$. The only value of $k$ in this range that is a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(m,n)$ is $k=0$.\nThe element corresponding to $k=0$ is $g=(0,0)$, which is the identity element $e$ of the group $G$.\nTherefore, the stabilizer of any point $(x,y)$ consists only of the identity element: $\\text{Stab}_G((x,y)) = \\{e\\}$. The size of the stabilizer is $|\\text{Stab}_G((x,y))|=1$.\n\nNow we can find the size of any orbit:\n$|\\text{Orb}_G((x,y))| = \\frac{|G|}{|\\text{Stab}_G((x,y))|} = \\frac{\\text{lcm}(m,n)}{1} = \\text{lcm}(m,n)$.\nSince the size of the stabilizer is 1 for all points in $X$, all orbits have the same size, which is equal to $\\text{lcm}(m,n)$.\n\nThe number of orbits is the total number of points in $X$ divided by the size of each orbit:\nNumber of orbits = $\\frac{|X|}{\\text{orbit size}} = \\frac{mn}{\\text{lcm}(m,n)}$.\n\nWe use the fundamental identity relating the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two integers: $m \\cdot n = \\text{gcd}(m,n) \\cdot \\text{lcm}(m,n)$.\nThis allows us to rewrite $\\text{lcm}(m,n) = \\frac{mn}{\\text{gcd}(m,n)}$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the number of orbits:\nNumber of orbits = $\\frac{mn}{mn / \\text{gcd}(m,n)} = \\text{gcd}(m,n)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of orbits for $m=42$ and $n=70$. We need to compute their greatest common divisor.\nWe find the prime factorization of each number:\n$42 = 2 \\times 21 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7$\n$70 = 7 \\times 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 7$\nThe common prime factors are 2 and 7.\n$\\text{gcd}(42, 70) = 2 \\times 7 = 14$.\n\nThus, there are 14 distinct orbits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14}$$", "id": "1616801"}, {"introduction": "Having explored actions on finite sets, we now transition from the discrete to the continuous.
