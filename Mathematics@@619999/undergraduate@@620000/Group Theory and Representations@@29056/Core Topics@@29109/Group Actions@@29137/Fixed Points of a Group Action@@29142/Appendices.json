This practice [@problem_id:1619100] presents a hypothetical system where reconfigurations are described by permutations, and the goal is to find the \"invariant\" nodes. Unlike the previous exercise, here you must first characterize the group generated by a few key operations before you can determine which elements are fixed by the entire group, a common task in analyzing systems with symmetric properties.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model for a fault-tolerant distributed system with five server nodes, labeled uniquely from 1 to 5. The set of nodes is thus $X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The system has two fundamental reconfiguration protocols, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, which permute the roles of the nodes. In cycle notation, these protocols are represented by the permutations $\\sigma_1 = (12)$ and $\\sigma_2 = (13)$.\n\nThe complete group of possible system reconfigurations, denoted by $G$, is the group generated by these two fundamental protocols. This means $G$ consists of all unique permutations that can be formed by applying $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ in any sequence and any number of times. A node is defined as \"invariant\" if its label is unchanged after the application of *every* possible reconfiguration permutation in the group $G$.\n\nDetermine the set of all invariant nodes.", "solution": "Let $X=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and let $G=\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\rangle$ with $\\sigma_1=(12)$ and $\\sigma_2=(13)$. A node $x\\in X$ is invariant if and only if $g(x)=x$ for every $g\\in G$.\n\nFirst, observe that both generators $(12)$ and $(13)$ fix $4$ and $5$. Since the product of permutations that fix a point also fixes that point, every $g\\in G$ fixes $4$ and $5$. Therefore, $4$ and $5$ are invariant.\n\nNext, determine the action of $G$ on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.

Hence $G$ contains the transpositions $(12)$, $(13)$, and $(23)$, which generate the full symmetric group on $\\{1,2,3\\}$, so $G$ acts as $S_3$ on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and fixes $4$ and $5$.\n\nTherefore, for each of $1,2,3$, there exists some $g\\in G$ that moves it: for instance, $(12)$ moves $1$ and $2$, and $(13)$ moves $1$ and $3$.

A 'network configuration' is defined by the set of direct, bidirectional communication links between pairs of these servers. For example, the configuration with only one link, between server 1 and server 2, is distinct from the configuration with only a link between server 1 and server 3. The configuration with no links is also a valid configuration.\n\nA routine maintenance protocol, called a 'cyclic shift', is applied to the network. Under this protocol, every connection is re-established based on a permutation of the server labels. Specifically, the role of server 1 is taken by server 2, server 2 by server 3, server 3 by server 4, and server 4 by server 1. For example, if a link initially exists between servers 1 and 3, after the cyclic shift, a link will exist between servers 2 and 4.\n\nA network configuration is called 'shift-invariant' if the set of connections after the cyclic shift is identical to the set of connections before the shift.
