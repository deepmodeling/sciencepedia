The orbit of an element $x \\in X$ is defined as the set $\\text{Orb}_G(x) = \\{g \\cdot x \\mid g \\in G\\}$. The set of all orbits forms a partition of $X$.\n\nFirst, let's explicitly identify the elements of the set $X$ and the group $G$.\n\nThe set $X$ consists of all non-zero vectors in $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$. The elements of $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$ are $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The non-zero vectors are:\n$$\nX = \\left\\{ v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, v_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}\n$$\nSo, the set $X$ has 3 elements.\n\nNext, let's identify the elements of the group $G = GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$. A $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is in $G$ if its determinant, $\\det(M) = ad - bc$, is non-zero. In $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the only non-zero element is 1, so we require $\\det(M) = ad - bc = 1$. Let's list all such matrices. A systematic way is to note that the columns of an invertible matrix must be linearly independent.\nThe first column can be any non-zero vector in $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$. There are 3 choices: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe second column can be any vector in $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$ that is not a scalar multiple of the first column. In $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the only non-zero scalar is 1, so the second column must not be the zero vector and must not be equal to the first column. There are $4-2=2$ choices for the second column.\nThus, the total number of matrices in $G$ is $3 \\times 2 = 6$. The elements of $G$ are:\n1.  $g_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Identity)\n2.  $g_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (det = $0-1 = -1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$)\n3.  $g_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (det = $1-0 = 1$)\n4.  $g_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (det = $1-0 = 1$)\n5.  $g_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (det = $0-1 = -1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$)\n6.  $g_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (det = $0-1 = -1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$)\n\nNow we can compute the orbit of any element in $X$. Let's choose $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and compute its orbit, $\\text{Orb}_G(v_1)$, by applying each element of $G$ to it.

Therefore, there is only one orbit. An action with a single orbit is called a transitive action.\n\nThe number of distinct orbits is 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "1810804"}]}
