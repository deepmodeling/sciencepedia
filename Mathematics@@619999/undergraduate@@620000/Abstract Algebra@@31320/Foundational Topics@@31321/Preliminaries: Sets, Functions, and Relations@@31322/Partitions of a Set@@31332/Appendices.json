An equivalence relation, denoted by `~`, must satisfy three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. The smallest such relation is the equivalence closure of the initial set of pairs $R = \\{(S_1, S_3), (S_3, S_5)\\}$. We need to add the minimum number of pairs to $R$ to satisfy all three properties.\n\n1.  **Initial Pairs**: The relation must contain the pairs corresponding to the direct links, so $S_1 \\sim S_3$ and $S_3 \\sim S_5$.\n\n2.  **Reflexivity**: For any element $x \\in S$, we must have $x \\sim x$. Thus, the relation must include the pairs $(S_1, S_1)$, $(S_2, S_2)$, $(S_3, S_3)$, $(S_4, S_4)$, and $(S_5, S_5)$.\n\n3.  **Symmetry**: For any pair $(x, y)$, if $x \\sim y$, then we must have $y \\sim x$.\n    - Since $S_1 \\sim S_3$, we must add the pair $(S_3, S_1)$, so $S_3 \\sim S_1$.\n    - Since $S_3 \\sim S_5$, we must add the pair $(S_5, S_3)$, so $S_5 \\sim S_3$.\n\n4.  **Transitivity**: For any elements $x, y, z \\in S$, if $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$, then we must have $x \\sim z$.\n    - We have $S_1 \\sim S_3$ and $S_3 \\sim S_5$.
