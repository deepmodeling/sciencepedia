Reflexivity**\nA relation $\\sim$ on a set $S$ is reflexive if for every element $s \\in S$, it is true that $s \\sim s$.\nLet's take an arbitrary string $s \\in S$. We need to check if $s \\sim s$.\nAccording to the definition of the relation, this holds if and only if $L(s) = L(s)$ and $C(s) = C(s)$.\n- The length of a string is always equal to itself, so $L(s) = L(s)$ is true.\n- The set of unique characters in a string is always equal to itself, so $C(s) = C(s)$ is true.\nSince both conditions are met, $s \\sim s$ for any string $s \\in S$. Thus, the relation $\\sim$ is **reflexive**.\n\n**2. Symmetry**\nA relation $\\sim$ on a set $S$ is symmetric if for every pair of elements $s_1, s_2 \\in S$, if $s_1 \\sim s_2$, then it must be that $s_2 \\sim s_1$.\nLet's assume $s_1 \\sim s_2$ for two arbitrary strings $s_1, s_2 \\in S$.\nBy the definition of the relation, this assumption means that $L(s_1) = L(s_2)$ and $C(s_1) = C(s_2)$.\nWe want to check if $s_2 \\sim s_1$. This requires checking if $L(s_2) = L(s_1)$ and $C(s_2) = C(s_1)$.\n- The equality of numbers is a symmetric property. If $L(s_1) = L(s_2)$, then it is necessarily true that $L(s_2) = L(s_1)$.\n- The equality of sets is a symmetric property. If $C(s_1) = C(s_2)$, then it is necessarily true that $C(s_2) = C(s_1)$.\nSince both conditions for $s_2 \\sim s_1$ are met, the implication holds. Thus, the relation $\\sim$ is **symmetric**.\n\n**3. Transitivity**\nA relation $\\sim$ on a set $S$ is transitive if for every triplet of elements $s_1, s_2, s_3 \\in S$, if $s_1 \\sim s_2$ and $s_2 \\sim s_3$, then it must be that $s_1 \\sim s_3$.\nLet's assume $s_1 \\sim s_2$ and $s_2 \\sim s_3$ for three arbitrary strings $s_1, s_2, s_3 \\in S$.\nFrom the assumption $s_1 \\sim s_2$, we know that $L(s_1) = L(s_2)$ and $C(s_1) = C(s_2)$.\nFrom the assumption $s_2 \\sim s_3$, we know that $L(s_2) = L(s_3)$ and $C(s_2) = C(s_3)$.\nWe want to check if $s_1 \\sim s_3$. This requires checking if $L(s_1) = L(s_3)$ and $C(s_1) = C(s_3)$.\n- The equality of numbers is a transitive property. Since $L(s_1) = L(s_2)$ and $L(s_2) = L(s_3)$, it follows that $L(s_1) = L(s_3)$.\n- The equality of sets is a transitive property. Since $C(s_1) = C(s_2)$ and $C(s_2) = C(s_3)$, it follows that $C(s_1) = C(s_3)$.\nSince both conditions for $s_1 \\sim s_3$ are met, the implication holds. For example, if $s_1 = \\text{\"aab\"}$, $s_2 = \\text{\"bba\"}$, and $s_3 = \\text{\"aba\"}$, we have:\n- $L(s_1)=3, C(s_1)=\\{'a','b'\\}$\n- $L(s_2)=3, C(s_2)=\\{'a','b'\\}$\n- $L(s_3)=3, C(s_3)=\\{'a','b'\\}$\nHere, $s_1 \\sim s_2$ (lengths are 3, character sets are equal) and $s_2 \\sim s_3$ (lengths are 3, character sets are equal). We check $s_1 \\sim s_3$: $L(s_1)=3=L(s_3)$ and $C(s_1)=\\{'a','b'\\}=C(s_3)$.
