In set notation, this corresponds to finding the cardinality of the set of elements that are not in $A$ and not in $B$. This set is the intersection of the complements of $A$ and $B$, which is denoted by $A^c \\cap B^c$.\n\nWe can use De Morgan's laws for sets, which states that for any two sets $A$ and $B$, $(A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c$.\nTherefore, we need to find $|(A \\cup B)^c|$.\n\nThe formula for the cardinality of the complement of a set is $|S^c| = |U| - |S|$.
