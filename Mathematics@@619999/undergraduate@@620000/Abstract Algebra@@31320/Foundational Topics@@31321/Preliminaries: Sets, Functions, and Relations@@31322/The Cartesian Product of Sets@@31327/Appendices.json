So, $(x, y) \\in S$.\nBy the definition of the projection set $\\pi_1(S)$, since $(x, y) \\in S$, the first component $x$ must be an element of $\\pi_1(S)$. So, $x \\in \\pi_1(S)$.\nSimilarly, by the definition of the projection set $\\pi_2(S)$, since $(x, y) \\in S$, the second component $y$ must be an element of $\\pi_2(S)$. So, $y \\in \\pi_2(S)$.\nNow, consider the Cartesian product $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$. By definition, this set consists of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \\in \\pi_1(S)$ and $b \\in \\pi_2(S)$.\nSince we have established that $x \\in \\pi_1(S)$ and $y \\in \\pi_2(S)$, the pair $(x, y)$ meets the criteria for membership in this Cartesian product. Thus, $(x, y) \\in \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$.\nSince our choice of $(x, y)$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, we have shown that every element of $S$ is also an element of $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$. Therefore, the inclusion $S \\subseteq \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ is always true.\n\nNext, let's examine if the reverse inclusion, $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S) \\subseteq S$, is always true. We can test this by attempting to construct a counterexample.\nLet $A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $B = \\{p, q\\}$.\nLet's choose a subset $S$ of $A \\times B$. Let $S = \\{(1, p), (2, q)\\}$.\nNow, we determine the projection sets for this specific $S$:\nThe set of first components is $\\pi_1(S) = \\{1, 2\\}$.\nThe set of second components is $\\pi_2(S) = \\{p, q\\}$.\nNext, we form the Cartesian product of these projection sets:\n$\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S) = \\{1, 2\\} \\times \\{p, q\\} = \\{(1, p), (1, q), (2, p), (2, q)\\}$.\nNow we compare this result with the original set $S$:\n$S = \\{(1, p), (2, q)\\}$\n$\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S) = \\{(1, p), (1, q), (2, p), (2, q)\\}$.\nWe can see that the element $(1, q)$ is in $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$, but it is not in $S$. Likewise, $(2, p) \\in \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ but $(2, p) \\notin S$.\nThis demonstrates that $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ is not a subset of $S$ in this case.

The counterexample shows an instance where the inclusion is proper.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $S = \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$ is always true.
