Each state can be represented by a binary string of length 10, where '1' signifies a switch is in the 'on' position and '0' signifies it is 'off'. For example, the string `1010000000` represents a state where the first and third switches are 'on' and all others are 'off'.\n\nDefine a relation $\\sim$ on the set $S$. For any two states $s_1, s_2 \\in S$, we say $s_1 \\sim s_2$ if the total number of switches in the 'on' position is the same for both states. It can be shown that this relation $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation, which partitions the set $S$ into disjoint equivalence classes.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of distinct equivalence classes and let $M$ be the size (i.e., cardinality) of the largest possible equivalence class.

The relation $s_1 \\sim s_2$ holds if and only if the strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ have the same number of '1's. This means that all strings within a single equivalence class have the same number of '1's, and any two strings from different equivalence classes must have a different number of '1's. Therefore, each equivalence class is uniquely defined by the number of '1's its members contain.\n\nThe strings are of length 10. The number of '1's in a string, let's call this number $k$, can be any integer from 0 (the string `0000000000`) to 10 (the string `1111111111`). The set of possible values for $k$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. Since each distinct value of $k$ corresponds to exactly one equivalence class, the total number of equivalence classes $N$ is the number of elements in this set. Counting the elements, we find there are $10 - 0 + 1 = 11$ possible values. Thus, $N = 11$.\n\nNext, let's determine the size of the largest equivalence class, $M$. The size of an equivalence class corresponding to a specific count of $k$ '1's is the total number of strings of length 10 that contain exactly $k$ '1's. This is a standard combinatorial problem: we need to choose $k$ positions for the '1's out of the 10 available positions. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{10}{k}$.\n\nTo find $M$, we need to find the maximum value of $\\binom{10}{k}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$. The values of the binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$ are symmetric about $k = n/2$ and achieve their maximum value at the center. For $n=10$, this maximum occurs at $k = 10/2 = 5$. We need to calculate the value of $\\binom{10}{5}$.\n\n$$ \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} $$\n\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling terms:\n$$ \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{(5 \\times 2) \\times 9 \\times (2 \\times 4) \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2 \\times 9 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 252 $$\nThus, the size of the largest equivalence class is $M=252$.\n\nFor confirmation, we can also calculate the sizes of the neighboring classes:\n$\\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 10 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 210$.\nBy symmetry, $\\binom{10}{6} = \\binom{10}{4} = 210$.\nSince $252 > 210$, our maximum is correct.\n\nThe pair $(N, M)$ is therefore $(11, 252)$.

This set is precisely the equivalence class $C_2$ corresponding to dimension 2.
