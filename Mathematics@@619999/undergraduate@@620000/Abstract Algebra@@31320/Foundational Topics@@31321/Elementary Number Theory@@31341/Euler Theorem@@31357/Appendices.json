While Euler's totient theorem provides a powerful method for modular exponentiation, it is only applicable when the base and modulus are coprime.

Determine the unique integer remainder $R$ that satisfies $0 \\le R < 42$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of $14^{26} \\pmod{42}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the base $a=14$ and the modulus $n=42$. We check if they are coprime by computing their greatest common divisor: $\\gcd(14, 42) = \\gcd(14, 3 \\times 14 - 0) = 14$. Since $\\gcd(14, 42) = 14 \\neq 1$, the standard form of Euler's totient theorem, which states that $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, cannot be directly applied.\n\nWe must use a more general approach. Let's analyze the modulus by finding its prime factorization: $n = 42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7$. The modulus $n=42$ is a square-free integer, meaning it is a product of distinct primes.\n\nFor any square-free integer $n = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes, there is an extension to Fermat's Little Theorem which states that $a^{\\phi(n)+1} \\equiv a \\pmod n$ for any integer $a$. We will first verify this property for $n=42$.\n\nFirst, we calculate Euler's totient function for $n=42$:\n$\\phi(42) = \\phi(2 \\times 3 \\times 7) = \\phi(2) \\times \\phi(3) \\times \\phi(7)$.\nUsing the formula $\\phi(p) = p-1$ for a prime $p$, we get:\n$\\phi(42) = (2-1) \\times (3-1) \\times (7-1) = 1 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n\nThe property we want to verify is $a^{\\phi(42)+1} \\equiv a \\pmod{42}$, which is $a^{13} \\equiv a \\pmod{42}$. We can prove this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by showing the congruence holds modulo each prime factor of 42.\n\nCase 1: Modulo 2.\nWe want to show $a^{13} \\equiv a \\pmod 2$. This is true for any integer $a$, since if $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, then $0^{13} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, and if $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, then $1^{13} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nCase 2: Modulo 3.\nWe want to show $a^{13} \\equiv a \\pmod 3$. If $\\gcd(a, 3) \\neq 1$, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, and the congruence becomes $0^{13} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, which is true. If $\\gcd(a, 3) = 1$, by Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), we have $a^{3-1} = a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. We can rewrite the exponent $13$ in terms of $2$: $13 = 6 \\times 2 + 1$.\nSo, $a^{13} = a^{6 \\times 2 + 1} = (a^2)^6 \\cdot a^1 \\equiv 1^6 \\cdot a \\equiv a \\pmod 3$.\nThe congruence holds for all integers $a$ modulo 3.\n\nCase 3: Modulo 7.\nWe want to show $a^{13} \\equiv a \\pmod 7$. If $\\gcd(a, 7) \\neq 1$, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$, and $0^{13} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$ is true. If $\\gcd(a, 7) = 1$, by FLT, $a^{7-1} = a^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$.
