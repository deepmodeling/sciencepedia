This is a direct application of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The solution involves two main stages: first, finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 51 and 87 using the Euclidean Algorithm, and second, working backward through the steps of the algorithm to express the gcd as a linear combination of 51 and 87.\n\nFirst, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find $d = \\gcd(51, 87)$.\nWe perform a sequence of divisions with remainder:\n1. Divide 87 by 51:\n$87 = 1 \\cdot 51 + 36$\n2. Divide 51 by the previous remainder, 36:\n$51 = 1 \\cdot 36 + 15$\n3. Divide 36 by the previous remainder, 15:\n$36 = 2 \\cdot 15 + 6$\n4. Divide 15 by the previous remainder, 6:\n$15 = 2 \\cdot 6 + 3$\n5. Divide 6 by the previous remainder, 3:\n$6 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 0$\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor. In this case, $d = \\gcd(51, 87) = 3$.\nSo, the equation we need to solve is $51x + 87y = 3$.\n\nNext, we use the steps of the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse to express $d=3$ as a linear combination of 51 and 87. We start from the second-to-last equation in our algorithm steps and substitute upward.\n\nFrom step 4, we can express the gcd, 3, as:\n$3 = 15 - 2 \\cdot 6$\n\nFrom step 3, we have an expression for the remainder 6: $6 = 36 - 2 \\cdot 15$. We substitute this into our equation for 3:\n$3 = 15 - 2 \\cdot (36 - 2 \\cdot 15)$\n$3 = 15 - 2 \\cdot 36 + 4 \\cdot 15$\nCombine the terms with 15:\n$3 = 5 \\cdot 15 - 2 \\cdot 36$\n\nFrom step 2, we have an expression for the remainder 15: $15 = 51 - 1 \\cdot 36$. We substitute this into our current equation for 3:\n$3 = 5 \\cdot (51 - 1 \\cdot 36) - 2 \\cdot 36$\n$3 = 5 \\cdot 51 - 5 \\cdot 36 - 2 \\cdot 36$\nCombine the terms with 36:\n$3 = 5 \\cdot 51 - 7 \\cdot 36$\n\nFinally, from step 1, we have an expression for the remainder 36: $36 = 87 - 1 \\cdot 51$. We substitute this into our latest equation for 3:\n$3 = 5 \\cdot 51 - 7 \\cdot (87 - 1 \\cdot 51)$\n$3 = 5 \\cdot 51 - 7 \\cdot 87 + 7 \\cdot 51$\nCombine the terms with 51:\n$3 = (5 + 7) \\cdot 51 - 7 \\cdot 87$\n$3 = 12 \\cdot 51 - 7 \\cdot 87$\n\nThis equation is in the form $51x + 87y = 3$. By comparing the coefficients, we find a solution:\n$x = 12$\n$y = -7$\n\nThus, a pair of integers $(x,y)$ that satisfies the equation is $(12, -7)$. We can check our answer:\n$51(12) + 87(-7) = 612 - 609 = 3$.\nThe calculation is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12 & -7 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1779177"}, {"introduction": "The principles underlying Bézout's Identity are not confined to the integers and extend to other algebraic structures like polynomial rings.
