This exercise [@problem_id:1827350] presents a system of congruences that appears complex at first glance but can be greatly simplified by recognizing a common pattern. Mastering the technique of rephrasing congruences of the form $x \\equiv n-1 \\pmod{n}$ is a valuable skill that highlights how observation can often lead to a more elegant solution than direct computation.", "problem": "A high-security data vault is protected by a time-based authentication system known as the Cyclic Key Rotation Protocol (CKRP). The system generates a single, unique, positive integer as an access code every hour. A cybersecurity analyst has been monitoring the access codes and has discovered a consistent pattern. Every valid access code adheres to the following set of rules:\n\n1.  When the code is divided by 2, the remainder is 1.\n2.  When the code is divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n3.  When the code is divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n4.  When the code is divided by 5, the remainder is 4.\n\nBased on these observed rules, determine the smallest positive integer that could be a valid access code for the data vault.", "solution": "Let the integer access code be denoted by $x$. The problem statement gives us a set of conditions that $x$ must satisfy. We can translate these conditions into a system of linear congruences.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1.  $x$ divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1. This can be written as $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n2.  $x$ divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. This can be written as $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n3.  $x$ divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3. This can be written as $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n4.  $x$ divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4. This can be written as $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nWe can observe a pattern in these congruences. For each congruence of the form $x \\equiv a \\pmod{n}$, we have $a = n-1$. This allows us to rewrite each congruence in an equivalent form using negative residues.\nA congruence $x \\equiv n-1 \\pmod{n}$ is equivalent to $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n}$. Let's apply this to our system:\n1.  $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ is equivalent to $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2}$.\n2.  $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ is equivalent to $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$.\n3.  $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ is equivalent to $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$.\n4.  $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ is equivalent to $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nSo, the integer $x$ must satisfy $x \\equiv -1$ for all the given moduli: 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nThe statement $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n}$ means that $x+1$ is divisible by $n$.\nTherefore, $x+1$ must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThis implies that $x+1$ must be a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5. We are looking for the smallest *positive* integer $x$. This corresponds to the smallest positive value of $x+1$. The smallest positive common multiple of a set of integers is their least common multiple (LCM).\n\nWe need to calculate the LCM of {2, 3, 4, 5}.\nTo find the LCM, we can use the prime factorization of each number:\n$2 = 2^1$\n$3 = 3^1$\n$4 = 2^2$\n$5 = 5^1$\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the set. The prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\nThe highest power of 2 is $2^2$.\nThe highest power of 3 is $3^1$.\nThe highest power of 5 is $5^1$.\n\nSo, $\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 3, 4, 5) = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60$.\n\nThe smallest positive value for the common multiple $x+1$ is 60.\nTherefore, we set $x+1=60$.\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n$x = 60 - 1 = 59$.\n\nThis value of $x$ is positive, so it is a possible access code. Since we used the least common multiple to find $x+1$, this value of $x$ must be the smallest positive integer that satisfies all the conditions. Any other solution would be of the form $x = 60k - 1$ for an integer $k$. For $k=1$, $x=59$. For $k=2$, $x=119$. For $k \\le 0$, $x$ is not positive. Thus, 59 is the smallest positive solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{59}$$", "id": "1827350"}, {"introduction": "Building on the pattern-recognition skills from the previous exercise, this problem [@problem_id:1827349] challenges you to apply the same logic in a more abstract, algebraic setting.
