This method works by assuming a solution exists, and then using the properties of a hypothetical \"smallest\" solution to construct an even smaller one, leading to a logical contradiction. This practice problem [@problem_id:1841650] walks you through this elegant line of reasoning, helping you master the structure of proofs by contradiction that rely on a minimal case.", "problem": "A student is attempting to demonstrate that the equation $x^3 = 3y^3$ has no solutions where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. They employ an argument based on the well-ordering principle, which asserts that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a least element.\n\nThe student's argument proceeds as follows:\n1.  Assume for the sake of contradiction that the set of positive integers $x$ for which there exists a positive integer $y$ satisfying $x^3 = 3y^3$ is non-empty. Let this set be denoted by $S$.\n2.  By the well-ordering principle, $S$ must contain a least element. Let's call this smallest element $x_0$.\n3.  By definition of the set $S$, there must exist a corresponding positive integer $y_0$ such that $x_0^3 = 3y_0^3$.\n4.  From this equation, we can see that $x_0^3$ is a multiple of 3. For the purposes of this problem, you may assume the property that for any integer $k$ and prime number $p$, if $k^3$ is a multiple of $p$, then $k$ is also a multiple of $p$. Therefore, $x_0$ must be a multiple of 3.\n5.  This means we can write $x_0 = 3x_1$ for some positive integer $x_1$.\n6.  Substituting this expression for $x_0$ back into the equation from step 3 gives: $(3x_1)^3 = 3y_0^3$.\n7.  Simplifying the equation yields $27x_1^3 = 3y_0^3$, which reduces to $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$.\n\nThe student wants to continue the argument to reach a contradiction with the initial assumption. Which of the following statements represents the correct and most direct logical continuation of the student's argument, using the equation from step 7?\n\nA. From $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$, we can deduce that $y_0^3$ is a multiple of 3, which implies $y_0$ is a multiple of 3. This allows us to define a new integer $y_1$ such that $y_0 = 3y_1$.\n\nB. From $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$, we can deduce that $y_0$ must be a multiple of 9. This allows us to define a new integer $y_1$ such that $y_0 = 9y_1$.\n\nC. Since $x_0$ was the smallest integer in the set $S$, and we have found an integer $x_1$ such that $x_0 = 3x_1$ (implying $x_1 < x_0$), we have already reached a contradiction.\n\nD. The equation $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$ only holds if $x_1 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$. This contradicts the requirement that $x$ and $y$ be positive integers.\n\nE. The argument is flawed because the assumption made in step 4 is incorrect; $x_0^3$ being a multiple of 3 does not necessarily imply $x_0$ is a multiple of 3.", "solution": "Assume toward contradiction that there exist positive integers $x,y$ with $x^{3}=3y^{3}$, and let $S=\\{x\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}:\\exists y\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0},\\, x^{3}=3y^{3}\\}$.
