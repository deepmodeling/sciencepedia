The elements of this ring can be represented by the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 41\\}$, with addition and multiplication performed modulo 42.\n\nCalculate the sum of all distinct zero divisors in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{42}$.", "solution": "Let $R = \\mathbb{Z}_{42}$ be the ring of integers modulo 42. The elements of this ring are $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 41\\}$.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, a zero divisor is a non-zero element. In the context of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, a non-zero element $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ is a zero divisor if and only if it is not a unit. An element $k$ is a unit if and only if it is invertible modulo $n$, which is equivalent to the condition that $k$ and $n$ are relatively prime, i.e., $\\gcd(k, n) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the zero divisors in $\\mathbb{Z}_{42}$ are the elements $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 41\\}$ such that $\\gcd(k, 42) \\neq 1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the sum of all such elements. Let $S_{zd}$ be this sum. A direct approach would be to identify all elements that are not coprime to 42 and add them up. A more elegant method is to calculate the sum of all non-zero elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_{42}$ and subtract the sum of the elements that are not zero divisors (i.e., the units).\n\nLet $S_{all}$ be the sum of all non-zero elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_{42}$.\n$$S_{all} = \\sum_{k=1}^{41} k$$\nThis is the sum of an arithmetic progression, which can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ for the sum of the first $m$ positive integers.

If $k$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ (meaning $\\gcd(k, n) = 1$), then $n-k$ is also a unit, since $\\gcd(n-k, n) = \\gcd(-k, n) = \\gcd(k, n) = 1$.\nFor $n > 2$, a unit $k$ cannot be equal to $n-k$, because this would imply $2k=n$, or $k=n/2$. The element $n/2$ is not a unit since $\\gcd(n/2, n) = n/2$, which is greater than 1. For $n=42$, $k=21$, and $\\gcd(21, 42)=21 \\ne 1$.\nThus, for $n=42$, the 12 units can be grouped into $\\frac{12}{2}=6$ distinct pairs of the form $(k, 42-k)$. The sum of the elements in each pair is $k + (42-k) = 42$.\n\nThe total sum of the units is the sum of these pairs:\n$$S_{units} = (\\text{number of pairs}) \\times (\\text{sum of each pair}) = \\frac{\\phi(42)}{2} \\cdot 42 = \\frac{12}{2} \\cdot 42 = 6 \\cdot 42 = 252$$\n\nThe sum of the zero divisors, $S_{zd}$, is the sum of all non-zero elements minus the sum of the units:\n$$S_{zd} = S_{all} - S_{units} = 861 - 252$$\n$$S_{zd} = 609$$\n\nSo, the sum of all distinct zero divisors in $\\mathbb{Z}_{42}$ is 609.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{609}$$", "id": "1783980"}]}
