The operations of addition and multiplication in this ring are defined component-wise.

Since $0+0=0$ is an even number, $(0,0) \\in S$. The set is non-empty.\n\n2.  **Closure under Addition**: Let $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ be in $S$. This means $a+b$ and $c+d$ are both even. Their sum is $(a+c, b+d)$. We check the sum of the components: $(a+c) + (b+d) = (a+b) + (c+d)$. Since the sum of two even integers is even, this result is even. Thus, $S$ is closed under addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Additive Inverses**: Let $(a,b) \\in S$. Then $a+b$ is even. The additive inverse is $(-a, -b)$. The sum of its components is $(-a) + (-b) = -(a+b)$. Since $a+b$ is even, so is its negative. Thus, $(-a, -b) \\in S$.\n\n4.  **Closure under Multiplication**: Let $(a,b),(c,d) \\in S$. Then $a+b$ and $c+d$ are even. This means $a$ and $b$ have the same parity ($a \\equiv b \\pmod 2$), and $c$ and $d$ have the same parity ($c \\equiv d \\pmod 2$). We check the product $(ac, bd)$. The sum of its components is $ac+bd$. We check its parity modulo 2:\n    $$ ac+bd \\equiv bc+bd = b(c+d) \\pmod 2 $$\n    Since we know $c+d$ is even, $c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.
