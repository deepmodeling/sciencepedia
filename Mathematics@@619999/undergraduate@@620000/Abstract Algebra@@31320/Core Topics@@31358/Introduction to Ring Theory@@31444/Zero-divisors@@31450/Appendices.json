If $a\\neq 0$ and $b\\neq 0$, then $ac=0$ forces $c=0$, and $bd=0$ forces $d=0$, which implies $(c,d)=(0,0)$, a contradiction.

Select all that apply.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which of the given rings contain a non-zero element $a$ that satisfies a specific nilpotent property: $a^2 \\neq 0$ and $a^3 = 0$. This means we are looking for an element with a nilpotency index of exactly 3. We will analyze each option systematically.\n\n**A. The ring $\\mathbb{Z}_8$**\nThe elements of this ring are the congruence classes modulo 8, which are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. We are looking for a non-zero element $a$ such that $a^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ but $a^2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$. Let's test the non-zero elements.\nLet's try $a=2$.\n$a^2 = 2^2 = 4$. Since $4 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, the condition $a^2 \\neq 0$ is met.\n$a^3 = 2^3 = 8$. Since $8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, the condition $a^3 = 0$ is met.\nThus, the element $a=2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ satisfies the given conditions. Option A is a correct choice.\n\n**B. The ring $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$**\nLet $a$ be a non-zero matrix in $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ such that $a^3 = 0$. This means $a$ is a nilpotent matrix. The minimal polynomial of $a$, let's call it $m_a(x)$, must divide the polynomial $x^3$. Thus, the possible minimal polynomials for $a$ are $x$, $x^2$, or $x^3$. Since $a$ is non-zero, its minimal polynomial cannot be $x$.\nAccording to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic polynomial. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, the characteristic polynomial, $p_a(\\lambda) = \\det(a - \\lambda I)$, has degree 2.\nThe minimal polynomial $m_a(x)$ must divide the characteristic polynomial $p_a(\\lambda)$. This implies that the degree of $m_a(x)$ must be less than or equal to the degree of $p_a(\\lambda)$, which is 2.\nThis leaves $x^2$ as the only possibility for the minimal polynomial of a non-zero nilpotent matrix in $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$. If $m_a(x) = x^2$, then by definition, $a^2 = 0$. This contradicts the condition $a^2 \\neq 0$. Therefore, no such element can exist in $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$. Option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. The ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x^3 - x \\rangle$**\nFirst, we analyze the structure of this ring. The polynomial in the ideal can be factored as $x^3 - x = x(x^2 - 1) = x(x-1)(x+1)$. The factors $x$, $x-1$, and $x+1$ are pairwise coprime in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem for rings, we have the isomorphism:\n$$ \\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x^3 - x \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x \\rangle \\times \\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x-1 \\rangle \\times \\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x+1 \\rangle $$\nThe quotient rings on the right are isomorphic to fields: $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x-c \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$. So, our ring is isomorphic to the direct product of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$.\nAn element $(c_1, c_2, c_3)$ in this direct product ring is nilpotent if and only if each component $c_i$ is nilpotent in its respective field $\\mathbb{Q}$. In any field, the only nilpotent element is 0.\nTherefore, the only nilpotent element in $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ is $(0,0,0)$, which corresponds to the zero element in the original quotient ring. Thus, there are no non-zero nilpotent elements, and consequently no element satisfying the problem's conditions. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D. The ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{30}$**\nAn element $[k]$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is nilpotent if and only if for some positive integer $m$, $k^m$ is a multiple of $n$. This happens if and only if every prime factor of $n$ is also a prime factor of $k$.\nThe prime factorization of $n=30$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5$. For an element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ to be nilpotent, its representative integer must be divisible by 2, 3, and 5. This means the integer must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3,5) = 30$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}_{30}$, any multiple of 30 is congruent to 0. So, the only nilpotent element in $\\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ is 0 itself.\nAlternatively, since 30 is a square-free integer, the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ is isomorphic to the direct product $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Each of these is a field, and a direct product of fields contains no non-zero nilpotent elements.\nTherefore, no such element exists in $\\mathbb{Z}_{30}$. Option D is incorrect.\n\n**E. The ring $T_3(\\mathbb{Z})$**\nThis is the ring of $3 \\times 3$ upper triangular matrices with integer entries. We need to check if we can find an example of an element $a$ with the desired properties. Let's consider a strictly upper triangular matrix.\nLet $a = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a non-zero matrix in $T_3(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet's compute its powers:\n$a^2 = a \\cdot a = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe matrix $a^2$ is not the zero matrix, so $a^2 \\neq 0$.\n$a^3 = a^2 \\cdot a = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe matrix $a^3$ is the zero matrix, so $a^3 = 0$.\nWe have found a non-zero element $a \\in T_3(\\mathbb{Z})$ that satisfies $a^2 \\neq 0$ and $a^3 = 0$. Thus, option E is a correct choice.\n\nIn conclusion, rings A and E contain an element with the specified properties.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "1844881"}]}
