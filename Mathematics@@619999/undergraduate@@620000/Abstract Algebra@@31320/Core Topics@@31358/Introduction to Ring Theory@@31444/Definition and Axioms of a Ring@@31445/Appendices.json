Non-emptiness: $0_{R}\\in Z(R)$ since for all $r\\in R$, $0_{R}\\cdot r=r\\cdot 0_{R}=0_{R}$, and $1_{R}\\in Z(R)$ since for all $r\\in R$, $1_{R}\\cdot r=r\\cdot 1_{R}=r$.

For $Z(R)$ to be a two-sided ideal, for any $z\\in Z(R)$ and any $r\\in R$, we would need $rz\\in Z(R)$ and $zr\\in Z(R)$.

The ring $M_{n}(F)$ is simple, so its only two-sided ideals are $\\{0\\}$ and $R$. Since $Z(R)$ is nonzero and strictly smaller than $R$, it cannot be an ideal. Therefore statement A is false in general.\n\nNow assume $R$ is a division ring $D$. Take $0\\neq z\\in Z(D)$. Since $D$ is a division ring, $z$ has a multiplicative inverse $z^{-1}\\in D$. For any $r\\in D$, from $rz=zr$ we deduce\n$$z^{-1}r=rz^{-1}$$\nby multiplying $rz=zr$ on the right by $z^{-1}$ to get $r=zr^{-1}$? More systematically: from $rz=zr$, multiply on the right by $z^{-1}$ to get $r=zr z^{-1}$, then multiply on the left by $z^{-1}$ to obtain $z^{-1}r=rz^{-1}$. Hence $z^{-1}$ commutes with every $r$, so $z^{-1}\\in Z(D)$. Therefore every nonzero element of $Z(D)$ has an inverse in $Z(D)$, and since $Z(D)$ is commutative as a subring of the center, $Z(D)$ is a field. Thus statement C is true.\n\nFinally, if $R$ is commutative, then every element commutes with every element, so by definition $Z(R)=R$.
