The integers form a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), meaning every ideal can be generated by a single element.

The properties of a quotient ring $R/I$ are determined by the nature of the ideal $I$. This problem explores a key instance of this principle: when an ideal is generated by a reducible polynomial like $x^2-1$, the resulting quotient ring is not an integral domain. By finding the zero divisors, you will gain a tangible understanding of how the structure of an ideal's generator directly shapes the quotient ring it defines [@problem_id:1801749].", "problem": "Consider the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients, denoted by $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Let $I$ be the principal ideal generated by the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - 1$, which is written as $I = \\langle x^2 - 1 \\rangle$. We then form the quotient ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x] / I$. The elements of this ring are cosets of the form $f(x) + I$, where $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Recall that the zero element in $R$ is the coset $0 + I = I$.\n\nThe ring $R$ is not an integral domain, meaning it contains zero divisors. Find two distinct, non-zero elements in $R$ whose product is the zero element. Present your answer as a pair of representative polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, whose corresponding cosets $f(x)+I$ and $g(x)+I$ are the desired elements. The degrees of your chosen polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must both be less than 2.\n\nExpress your answer as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix containing the two polynomials.", "solution": "We work in the quotient ring $R=\\mathbb{Z}[x]/I$ with $I=\\langle x^{2}-1\\rangle$. In any quotient ring, the product of cosets satisfies $(f(x)+I)(g(x)+I)=f(x)g(x)+I$. The generator polynomial factors over $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ as\n$$\nx^{2}-1=(x-1)(x+1).\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n(x-1+I)(x+1+I)=(x^{2}-1)+I=I,\n$$\nwhich is the zero element of $R$, so the cosets of $x-1$ and $x+1$ multiply to zero in $R$.\n\nWe verify that each factor represents a non-zero element of $R$.

The same degree argument shows $x+1\\notin I$, so both cosets are non-zero.\n\nWe also check the two cosets are distinct. If $x-1+I=x+1+I$, then subtracting gives $2+I=I$, i.e., $2\\in I$.
