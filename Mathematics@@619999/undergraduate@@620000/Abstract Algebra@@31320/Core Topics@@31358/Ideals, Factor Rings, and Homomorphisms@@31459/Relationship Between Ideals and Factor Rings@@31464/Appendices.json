By examining a factor ring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{180}$, you will see how a fundamental isomorphism theorem allows us to identify it with a much simpler ring, $\\mathbb{Z}_{d}$. This exercise [@problem_id:1818346] reinforces the idea that factor rings aren't just abstract constructions; they can often be understood as well-known objects in disguise, allowing us to analyze their properties, like the presence of zero-divisors, with familiar tools.", "problem": "Consider the commutative ring with identity $R = \\mathbb{Z}_{180}$, which is the ring of integers modulo 180 under the standard operations of addition and multiplication. Let $I$ be the principal ideal generated by the element $[12]$ in $R$, which is denoted as $I = \\langle [12] \\rangle$. This ideal consists of all multiples of $[12]$ within the ring $R$.\n\nWe can construct the factor ring (also known as the quotient ring) $Q = R/I$. The elements of this factor ring are the cosets of $I$ in $R$. An element $x$ in a ring is called a zero divisor if there exists a non-zero element $y$ in the same ring such that their product $xy$ is the zero element of the ring.\n\nDetermine the total number of zero divisors in the factor ring $Q$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of zero divisors in the factor ring $Q = \\mathbb{Z}_{180} / \\langle [12] \\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the structure of the factor ring $Q$. A fundamental theorem in ring theory states that for the ring of integers modulo $n$, $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, and a principal ideal generated by an element $[k]$, $\\langle [k] \\rangle$, the resulting factor ring is isomorphic to another ring of integers modulo $d$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $k$. Symbolically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z}_n / \\langle [k] \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{\\gcd(n, k)} $$\nIn our problem, $n=180$ and $k=12$. We apply this theorem to find the ring isomorphic to $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\mathbb{Z}_{180} / \\langle [12] \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{\\gcd(180, 12)} $$\nTo find the greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(180, 12)$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization. However, we can simply observe that $180$ is a multiple of $12$, since $180 = 12 \\times 15$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $180$ and $12$ is $12$.\n$$ \\gcd(180, 12) = 12 $$\nThus, the factor ring $Q$ is isomorphic to the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n$$ Q \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12} $$\nSince the rings are isomorphic, they share all their structural algebraic properties. This means that counting the number of zero divisors in $Q$ is equivalent to counting the number of zero divisors in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of zero divisors in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The problem defines a zero divisor as an element $x$ for which there exists a non-zero element $y$ such that $xy=0$.\nIn a finite commutative ring with identity, such as $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, an element is either a unit or a zero divisor. To be precise, a non-zero element is a unit if and only if it is not a zero divisor. The zero element itself is a zero divisor as long as the ring is not the trivial ring $\\{0\\}$ (which $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is not). For $x=[0]$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, we can choose a non-zero $y$, for example $y=[2]$, and see that $xy = [0][2] = [0]$. Thus, $[0]$ is a zero divisor by the given definition.\n\nTherefore, the set of all zero divisors in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is precisely the set of all elements that are not units. To find the number of zero divisors, we can find the total number of elements and subtract the number of units.\n\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ has 12 elements: $\\{[0], [1], [2], \\dots, [11]\\}$.\n\nAn element $[a]$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is a unit if and only if $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$. The number of units in $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$.\nFor our ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, the number of units is $\\phi(12)$. We calculate $\\phi(12)$ using its prime factorization $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$.\n$$ \\phi(12) = 12 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 12 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 4 $$\nSo, there are 4 units in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. These units correspond to the elements $[a]$ where $a \\in \\{1, 5, 7, 11\\}$, as these are the integers between $1$ and $11$ that are coprime to $12$.\n\nThe number of zero divisors is the total number of elements minus the number of units.\n$$ \\text{Number of zero divisors} = (\\text{Total elements in } \\mathbb{Z}_{12}) - (\\text{Number of units in } \\mathbb{Z}_{12}) $$\n$$ \\text{Number of zero divisors} = 12 - 4 = 8 $$\nThe 8 zero divisors in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ are the elements that are not units: $\\{[0], [2], [3], [4], [6], [8], [9], [10]\\}$.\n\nSince $Q \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, the number of zero divisors in $Q$ is also 8.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1818346"}, {"introduction": "Moving from integers to polynomial rings, this exercise explores a critical relationship: how the nature of an ideal's generator polynomial shapes the resulting factor ring.
