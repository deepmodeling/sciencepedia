This theorem establishes a one-to-one, inclusion-preserving correspondence between the ideals of the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x] / I$ and the ideals of the parent ring $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ that contain the ideal $I = \\langle x^2-x \\rangle$. Crucially, this correspondence preserves the properties of being prime and maximal.\n\nTherefore, our task is equivalent to finding the number of prime and maximal ideals of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ that contain the ideal $I = \\langle x^2-x \\rangle$.\n\nLet $P$ be a prime ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ such that $I \\subseteq P$.\nThe ideal $I$ is generated by $x^2-x = x(x-1)$. Since $x(x-1) \\in I \\subseteq P$ and $P$ is a prime ideal, we must have either $x \\in P$ or $x-1 \\in P$.\n\nThis leads to two cases:\n\n**Case 1: $x \\in P$**\nIf $x \\in P$, then the ideal $\\langle x \\rangle$ is contained in $P$. By the Correspondence Theorem, the ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ containing $\\langle x \\rangle$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the ideals of the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]/\\langle x \\rangle$.\nThe evaluation homomorphism $\\phi_0: \\mathbb{Z}_6[x] \\to \\mathbb{Z}_6$ defined by $\\phi_0(f(x)) = f(0)$ is surjective and has kernel $\\langle x \\rangle$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]/\\langle x \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\nThe prime ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ containing $\\langle x \\rangle$ thus correspond to the prime ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_6$. An ideal $\\langle k \\rangle$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is prime if and only if $\\mathbb{Z}_n/\\langle k \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{\\gcd(k,n)}$ is an integral domain, which happens if and only if $\\gcd(k,n)$ is a prime number.\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}_6$, the prime ideals are:\n1. $\\langle 2 \\rangle$, since $\\gcd(2,6)=2$ is prime.\n2. $\\langle 3 \\rangle$, since $\\gcd(3,6)=3$ is prime.\nThe corresponding prime ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ containing $\\langle x \\rangle$ are the preimages under the evaluation map, which are $P_1 = \\langle x, 2 \\rangle$ and $P_2 = \\langle x, 3 \\rangle$. Both of these ideals contain $\\langle x^2-x \\rangle$ because they contain $x$.\n\n**Case 2: $x-1 \\in P$**\nIf $x-1 \\in P$, then the ideal $\\langle x-1 \\rangle$ is contained in $P$. Similarly, the ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ containing $\\langle x-1 \\rangle$ correspond to the ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]/\\langle x-1 \\rangle$.\nThe evaluation homomorphism $\\phi_1: \\mathbb{Z}_6[x] \\to \\mathbb{Z}_6$ defined by $\\phi_1(f(x)) = f(1)$ gives an isomorphism $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]/\\langle x-1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\nAgain, we look for the prime ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_6$, which are $\\langle 2 \\rangle$ and $\\langle 3 \\rangle$. The corresponding prime ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ containing $\\langle x-1 \\rangle$ are $P_3 = \\langle x-1, 2 \\rangle$ and $P_4 = \\langle x-1, 3 \\rangle$. Both contain $\\langle x^2-x \\rangle$ because they contain $x-1$.\n\nA prime ideal $P$ cannot contain both $x$ and $x-1$, because if it did, it would contain their difference, $x - (x-1) = 1$. An ideal containing 1 is the entire ring, which is not prime by definition. Therefore, the two sets of ideals we found are disjoint.\nIn total, we have found four distinct prime ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ that contain $I$:\n$P_1 = \\langle x, 2 \\rangle$\n$P_2 = \\langle x, 3 \\rangle$\n$P_3 = \\langle x-1, 2 \\rangle$\n$P_4 = \\langle x-1, 3 \\rangle$\nBy the Correspondence Theorem, the ring $R$ has exactly **4 prime ideals**.\n\nNext, we identify which of these are maximal ideals. An ideal $M$ in a ring $S$ is maximal if and only if the quotient ring $S/M$ is a field. In a commutative ring, every maximal ideal is prime. So, we only need to check which of our four prime ideals $P_i$ are maximal in $\\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$.\n\n1.

Since the correspondence theorem preserves maximality, the four corresponding ideals in the quotient ring $R$ are all maximal ideals.\nTherefore, the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}_6[x] / \\langle x^2-x \\rangle$ has **4 maximal ideals**.\n\nIn conclusion, the ring $R$ has 4 prime ideals and 4 maximal ideals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1838979"}]}
