For an element $x$ in a commutative ring $R$, the principal ideal generated by $x$ is the set $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{rx \\mid r \\in R\\}$.

Hence $R$ is a principal ideal domain and a unique factorization domain. In a PID, a principal ideal $\\langle x \\rangle$ is prime if and only if its generator $x$ is an irreducible (equivalently, a prime element in a UFD).\n\nKey facts we will use:\n- The norm is multiplicative: $N(xy)=N(x)N(y)$ for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n- If $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has both real and imaginary parts nonzero and $N(x)$ is a rational prime, then $x$ is irreducible: if $x=uv$, then $N(x)=N(u)N(v)$, and the primality of $N(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$ forces $N(u)=1$ or $N(v)=1$, so one factor is a unit.\n- For a rational prime $p$, if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ then $p$ factors nontrivially in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, while if $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ then $p$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nNow analyze each ideal:\n\n1) $I_{1}=\\langle 3+2i \\rangle$.

The integer $5$ satisfies $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and indeed factors as\n$$\n5=(2+i)(2-i),\n$$\nwith $N(2\\pm i)=2^{2}+1^{2}=5>1$, so neither factor is a unit.

However, there are no Gaussian integers with norm $3$, since the Diophantine equation $a^{2}+b^{2}=3$ has no integer solutions. Therefore any factorization of $3$ must involve a unit, so $3$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
