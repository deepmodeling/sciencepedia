Therefore, we need to find the GCD of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.

Since both $4$ and $6$ are in the ideal $K$, any integer linear combination of them must also be in $K$. In particular, their greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(4,6)=2$, must be in $K$.

We need to show that each of these generators can be written as an element of $\\langle 2, x^3-1 \\rangle$.\n- For the generator $4$: $4 = 2 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot (x^3-1)$. This is an element of $\\langle 2, x^3-1 \\rangle$.\n- For the generator $2x^2+2x+2$: $2x^2+2x+2 = 2 \\cdot (x^2+x+1) + 0 \\cdot (x^3-1)$. This is an element of $\\langle 2, x^3-1 \\rangle$.\n- For the generator $2x-2$: $2x-2 = 2 \\cdot (x-1) + 0 \\cdot (x^3-1)$.
