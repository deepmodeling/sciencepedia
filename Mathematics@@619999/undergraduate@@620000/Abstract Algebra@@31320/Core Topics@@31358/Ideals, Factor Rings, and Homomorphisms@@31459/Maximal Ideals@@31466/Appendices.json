A fundamental result in ring theory states that the ideals of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the positive divisors of $n$. Specifically, for each positive divisor $d$ of $n$, the set $I = \\langle d \\rangle = \\{kd \\pmod n \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is an ideal, and these are all the ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$.\n\nFirst, we list the positive divisors of 18. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\nThis gives us the complete list of ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}_{18}$:\n1.  $\\langle 1 \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ (the entire ring)\n2.  $\\langle 2 \\rangle = \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16\\}$\n3.  $\\langle 3 \\rangle = \\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\\}$\n4.  $\\langle 6 \\rangle = \\{0, 6, 12\\}$\n5.  $\\langle 9 \\rangle = \\{0, 9\\}$\n6.  $\\langle 18 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle = \\{0\\}$ (the zero ideal)\n\nNext, we identify which of these are maximal ideals. An ideal $M$ in a ring $R$ is called maximal if $M \\neq R$ and the only ideals strictly containing $M$ are $R$ itself. For the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, there is a specific criterion for maximality: an ideal $\\langle d \\rangle$ is a maximal ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ if and only if the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_n / \\langle d \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a field. This condition is met if and only if $d$ is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, to find the maximal ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_{18}$, we need to find the ideals $\\langle d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a prime divisor of 18.\n\nThe prime factorization of 18 is $18 = 2 \\times 3^2$. The distinct prime divisors of 18 are 2 and 3.\n\nAccording to the criterion, the maximal ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ are those generated by these prime divisors:\n- The ideal generated by the prime 2: $\\langle 2 \\rangle$.\n- The ideal generated by the prime 3: $\\langle 3 \\rangle$.\n\nSo, the complete set of maximal ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ is $\\{\\langle 2 \\rangle, \\langle 3 \\rangle\\}$.\n\nLet's verify why the other proper non-zero ideals are not maximal.\n- $\\langle 6 \\rangle$: Since $6 = 3 \\times 2$, the ideal $\\langle 6 \\rangle$ is contained in $\\langle 2 \\rangle$. For example, every element in $\\langle 6 \\rangle$ is a multiple of 6, and thus also a multiple of 2, so it belongs to $\\langle 2 \\rangle$. We have the proper inclusion $\\langle 6 \\rangle \\subsetneq \\langle 2 \\rangle \\subsetneq \\mathbb{Z}_{18}$. Therefore, $\\langle 6 \\rangle$ is not maximal.\n- $\\langle 9 \\rangle$: Since $9 = 3 \\times 3$, the ideal $\\langle 9 \\rangle$ is contained in $\\langle 3 \\rangle$. We have the proper inclusion $\\langle 9 \\rangle \\subsetneq \\langle 3 \\rangle \\subsetneq \\mathbb{Z}_{18}$. Therefore, $\\langle 9 \\rangle$ is not maximal.\n\nBy definition, the ideal $\\langle 1 \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ is not a proper ideal and thus not maximal. The zero ideal $\\langle 0 \\rangle$ is contained in all other ideals (e.g., $\\langle 9 \\rangle$), so it is not maximal.\n\nComparing our result $\\{\\langle 2 \\rangle, \\langle 3 \\rangle\\}$ with the given choices:\n- A. $\\{\\langle 2 \\rangle, \\langle 3 \\rangle\\}$ - This matches our finding.\n- B. $\\{\\langle 3 \\rangle\\}$ - This is incomplete as it omits $\\langle 2 \\rangle$.\n- C. $\\{\\langle 9 \\rangle\\}$ - This is incorrect because $\\langle 9 \\rangle$ is not maximal.\n- D. $\\{\\langle 2 \\rangle, \\langle 3 \\rangle, \\langle 6 \\rangle, \\langle 9 \\rangle\\}$ - This is incorrect as it includes the non-maximal ideals $\\langle 6 \\rangle$ and $\\langle 9 \\rangle$.\n- E. $\\{\\langle 6 \\rangle\\}$ - This is incorrect because $\\langle 6 \\rangle$ is not maximal.\n\nThus, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1801783"}, {"introduction": "Having explored maximal ideals in finite rings, we now turn our attention to the infinite ring of polynomials with rational coefficients, $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.
