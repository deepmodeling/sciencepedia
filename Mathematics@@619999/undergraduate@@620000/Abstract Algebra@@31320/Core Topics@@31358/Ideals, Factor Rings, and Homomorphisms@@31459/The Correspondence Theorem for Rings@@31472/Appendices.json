This practice [@problem_id:1828331] explores the quotient of the matrix ring $M_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ by an ideal of matrices with entries divisible by a prime $p$. By applying the Isomorphism Theorems, which are closely related to the Correspondence Theorem, we can identify this quotient ring with a much simpler structureâ€”a matrix ring over a finite field.

Let $J$ be a nonzero two-sided ideal of $M_{n}(F)$. Choose $0 \\neq A \\in J$, and let $a_{rs}$ be a nonzero entry of $A$ (such an entry exists by the choice of $A$). For any indices $i,j$, consider the standard elementary matrices $E_{ir}$ and $E_{sj}$, which satisfy $E_{ir}AE_{sj} = a_{rs}E_{ij}$. Since $a_{rs} \\in F^{\\times}$ is invertible, we have\n$$\nE_{ij} = a_{rs}^{-1} \\left(E_{ir} A E_{sj}\\right) \\in J.\n$$\nBecause this holds for all $i,j$, every elementary matrix $E_{ij}$ lies in $J$.
