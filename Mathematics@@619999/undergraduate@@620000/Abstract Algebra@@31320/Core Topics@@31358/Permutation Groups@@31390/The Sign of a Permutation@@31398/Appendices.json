This exercise challenges you to verify a crucial theorem stating that while the decomposition of a permutation into transpositions is not unique, its parity always is. By examining two different decompositions for a simple 5-cycle, you will solidify your grasp on how the sign is calculated and why it's a well-defined property of any permutation [@problem_id:1839514].", "problem": "In an introductory abstract algebra course, a discussion arises about different ways to decompose a permutation into a product of transpositions.

This practice extends the concept of the sign to these more complex permutations, highlighting the essential multiplicative property of the sign function. Through the scenario of a network packet scheduler, you will learn to determine the overall parity of a permutation by simply combining the parities of its individual cyclic components [@problem_id:1839522].", "problem": "Consider the set of nine distinct data packets in a network buffer, labeled $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_9$. A packet scheduler rearranges these packets according to a permutation $\\sigma$. The permutation $\\sigma$ can be described as the result of two independent sorting operations. The first operation performs a cyclic shift on the packets $\\{P_1, P_5, P_7\\}$, sending $P_1$ to the position of $P_5$, $P_5$ to the position of $P_7$, and $P_7$ back to the position of $P_1$.

We need to check the condition for an inversion, which is $\\sigma(i) > \\sigma(j)$.\n$$\nk - i + 1 > k - j + 1\n$$\nSubtracting $k+1$ from both sides gives:\n$$\n-i > -j\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\ni < j\n$$\nThis is precisely the condition we started with for the pair $(i, j)$. This means that for *every* pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $1 \\le i < j \\le k$, the pair forms an inversion.\n\nTherefore, the total number of inversions, $N$, is the number of pairs $(i, j)$ that can be chosen from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ with the condition $i < j$.
