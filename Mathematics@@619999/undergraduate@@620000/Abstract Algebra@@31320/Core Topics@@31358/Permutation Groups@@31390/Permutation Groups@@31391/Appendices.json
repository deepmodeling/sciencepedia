A particular enzymatic process is known to induce permutations with a very specific structure: four of the markers are cyclically permuted among their positions, while the remaining two markers are swapped.\n\nMathematically, this corresponds to finding permutations in the Symmetric Group on 6 elements, $S_6$, that can be written as a product of one 4-cycle and one 2-cycle in their disjoint cycle decomposition. For example, if the markers are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, one such permutation would be $(1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4)(5 \\ 6)$.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct permutations in $S_6$ that have this cycle structure of one 4-cycle and one 2-cycle.", "solution": "We seek the number of permutations in $S_{6}$ whose disjoint cycle decomposition consists of exactly one $4$-cycle and one $2$-cycle.\n\nMethod 1 (direct combinatorial construction): First, choose which $4$ of the $6$ elements will form the $4$-cycle. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{4}$ ways. For a fixed set of $4$ distinct elements, the number of distinct $4$-cycles on these elements is the number of cyclic orderings, which equals $\\frac{4!}{4}=(4-1)!$, because cyclic rotations give the same cycle. The remaining $2$ elements necessarily form a single $2$-cycle, and there is exactly $1$ such transposition on those two elements.

This exercise asks you to find the maximum possible order for an element in the symmetric group $S_9$, a classic problem that links a permutation's cycle structure to number theory concepts like the least common multiple (LCM). By exploring the partitions of 9, you will develop a deeper intuition for how a permutation's structure dictates its behavior over time [@problem_id:1813120].", "problem": "Consider a machine that shuffles a deck of 9 uniquely numbered cards, labeled 1 through 9. The shuffling process is deterministic, meaning that each time the machine operates, it applies the exact same permutation to the order of the cards. After a certain number of shuffles, the deck of cards will inevitably return to its original sorted order (1, 2, ..., 9). Depending on the specific permutation the machine is programmed to perform, the number of shuffles required for the deck to first return to its original order can vary. What is the maximum possible number of shuffles required for the deck to first return to its initial state, over all possible non-trivial shuffling permutations?", "solution": "Let the machine’s shuffle be a permutation $\\sigma \\in S_{9}$.

We examine possibilities by including the largest feasible parts and using the remaining sum efficiently:\n\n1. If a part $8$ appears, the remaining sum is $1$, so the type is $8+1$ and $\\operatorname{lcm}(8,1)=8$.\n\n2.

This practice challenges you to determine the size of a subgroup of $S_4$ generated by two specific permutations, a task that requires synthesizing multiple core concepts. By examining the interactions between the generators, you will employ techniques like conjugacy and the properties of normal subgroups to unveil the complete structure of the generated group [@problem_id:1813100].", "problem": "In abstract algebra, the symmetric group on a set of $n$ elements, denoted $S_n$, is the group of all permutations of the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. The group operation is the composition of permutations. Permutations are often written in cycle notation. For example, the permutation $(1 \\ 3 \\ 2)$ in $S_4$ maps $1 \\to 3$, $3 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 1$, and leaves $4$ fixed. The composition of permutations is performed from right to left, i.e., $(\\pi_1 \\pi_2)(x) = \\pi_1(\\pi_2(x))$.\n\nConsider the symmetric group $S_4$. Let $\\sigma = (1 \\ 2)$ and $\\tau = (1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4)$ be two permutations in $S_4$. Let $H$ be the subgroup of $S_4$ generated by these two permutations, denoted by $H = \\langle \\sigma, \\tau \\rangle$. This means $H$ is the smallest subgroup of $S_4$ that contains both $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$.\n\nWhat is the order of the subgroup $H$?", "solution": "Let the two generators of the subgroup $H$ be $\\sigma = (1 \\ 2)$ and $\\tau = (1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4)$. The subgroup $H = \\langle \\sigma, \\tau \\rangle$ is the set of all finite products of $\\sigma$, $\\tau$, and their inverses. The order of $H$, denoted $|H|$, is the number of distinct elements in this set.\n\nFirst, let's determine the orders of the generators.\nThe order of $\\sigma = (1 \\ 2)$ is 2, since $\\sigma^2 = (1 \\ 2)(1 \\ 2) = e$, where $e$ is the identity permutation.\nThe order of $\\tau = (1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4)$ is 4, since it is a 4-cycle. We can verify this:\n$\\tau^2 = (1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4)(1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4) = (1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4)$\n$\\tau^3 = \\tau^2 \\tau = (1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4)(1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4) = (1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \\ 3)$\n$\\tau^4 = (\\tau^2)^2 = ((1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4))^2 = (1 \\ 2)^2 (3 \\ 4)^2 = e \\cdot e = e$\nThus, the order of $\\tau$ is 4.\n\nSince $H$ is a subgroup containing $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$, its order $|H|$ must be a multiple of the orders of these elements. Therefore, $|H|$ must be a multiple of $\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 4) = 4$. By Lagrange's theorem, $|H|$ must also be a divisor of the order of the parent group $S_4$. The order of $S_4$ is $4! = 24$. The possible values for $|H|$ are thus $4, 8, 12, 24$.\n\nThe subgroup $H$ contains $\\sigma = (1 \\ 2)$. Let's consider the conjugate of $\\sigma$ by $\\tau$, which must also be in $H$:\n$\\tau \\sigma \\tau^{-1}$\nWe can compute this using the rule $\\pi(i_1 \\ i_2 \\ \\dots \\ i_k)\\pi^{-1} = (\\pi(i_1) \\ \\pi(i_2) \\ \\dots \\ \\pi(i_k))$.\n$\\tau \\sigma \\tau^{-1} = \\tau(1 \\ 2)\\tau^{-1} = (\\tau(1) \\ \\tau(2)) = (3 \\ 4)$.\nSo, the permutation $(3 \\ 4)$ is in $H$.\n\nSince $H$ is a group and it contains $\\sigma = (1 \\ 2)$ and $(3 \\ 4)$, it must also contain the subgroup generated by these two elements. Let's call this subgroup $N = \\langle (1 \\ 2), (3 \\ 4) \\rangle$. The elements $(1 \\ 2)$ and $(3 \\ 4)$ are disjoint cycles, so they commute. The elements of $N$ are:\n$e$\n$(1 \\ 2)$\n$(3 \\ 4)$\n$(1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4)$\nThis subgroup $N$ has order 4 and is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4$. Since all these elements are in $H$, we know $N \\subseteq H$.\n\nNow let's check if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $H$. A subgroup $N$ is normal in $H$ if for every $h \\in H$, $hNh^{-1} = N$. It is sufficient to check this for the generators of $H$, which are $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$.\nFor the generator $\\sigma = (1 \\ 2)$:\nSince $\\sigma \\in N$ and $N$ is abelian, for any $n \\in N$, $\\sigma n \\sigma^{-1} = n \\sigma \\sigma^{-1} = n \\in N$. So conjugation by $\\sigma$ leaves $N$ invariant.\n\nFor the generator $\\tau = (1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4)$:\nWe need to check that $\\tau n \\tau^{-1} \\in N$ for all $n \\in N$. The non-identity elements of $N$ are $(1 \\ 2)$, $(3 \\ 4)$, and $(1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4)$.\n$\\tau(1 \\ 2)\\tau^{-1} = (\\tau(1) \\ \\tau(2)) = (3 \\ 4) \\in N$.\n$\\tau(3 \\ 4)\\tau^{-1} = (\\tau(3) \\ \\tau(4)) = (2 \\ 1) = (1 \\ 2) \\in N$.\n$\\tau((1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4))\\tau^{-1} = (\\tau(1 \\ 2)\\tau^{-1})(\\tau(3 \\ 4)\\tau^{-1}) = (3 \\ 4)(1 \\ 2) = (1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4) \\in N$.\nSince conjugation by both generators of $H$ maps elements of $N$ back into $N$, $N$ is a normal subgroup of $H$.\n\nSince $N$ is a normal subgroup of $H$, we can consider the quotient group $H/N$. By Lagrange's theorem, we have $|H| = |N| \\cdot |H/N|$. We know $|N| = 4$. We need to find the order of the quotient group $|H/N|$.\nThe elements of $H/N$ are the cosets of $N$ in $H$. The group $H/N$ is generated by the cosets corresponding to the generators of $H$. The generators of $H/N$ are $\\sigma N$ and $\\tau N$.\nSince $\\sigma = (1 \\ 2) \\in N$, the coset $\\sigma N$ is just $N$ itself, which is the identity element in the quotient group $H/N$.\nThe other generator is $\\tau N$. The order of this element in $H/N$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $(\\tau N)^k = \\tau^k N = N$, which is equivalent to $\\tau^k \\in N$.\nLet's check the powers of $\\tau$:\n$\\tau^1 = (1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4) \\notin N$.\n$\\tau^2 = (1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4) \\in N$.\nThe smallest positive power is $k=2$. Therefore, the order of the element $\\tau N$ in $H/N$ is 2.\nSince $\\sigma N$ is the identity, the quotient group $H/N$ is generated by $\\tau N$ alone, so $H/N = \\langle \\tau N \\rangle$.\nThe order of this cyclic group is the order of its generator, which is 2. So, $|H/N| = 2$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the order of $H$:\n$|H| = |N| \\cdot |H/N| = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe subgroup $H$ consists of the 4 elements of $N$ and the 4 elements of the coset $\\tau N$.\nThe elements are:\n$N = \\{e, (1 \\ 2), (3 \\ 4), (1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4)\\}$\n$\\tau N = \\{\\tau e, \\tau(1 \\ 2), \\tau(3 \\ 4), \\tau(1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4)\\} = \\{(1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4), (1 \\ 4)(2 \\ 3), (1 \\ 3)(2 \\ 4), (1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \\ 3)\\}$\nThese 8 distinct permutations form the subgroup $H$.\nThus, the order of $H$ is 8.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1813100"}]}
