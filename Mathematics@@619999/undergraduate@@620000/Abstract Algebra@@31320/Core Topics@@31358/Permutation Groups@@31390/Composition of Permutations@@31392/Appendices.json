A permutation's order is determined by the lengths of its disjoint cycles, a link that connects group theory with number theory. This exercise asks you to use this connection to build a permutation in $S_{10}$ that has the largest possible order, a classic problem in combinatorial group theory [@problem_id:1783292].", "problem": "Consider the symmetric group $S_{10}$, which is the group of all one-to-one and onto functions (i.e., permutations) from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ to itself, with the group operation being function composition.

Determine the maximum possible order for any permutation in $S_{10}$.", "solution": "Every permutation in $S_{10}$ decomposes uniquely (up to order of cycles) into disjoint cycles. If the disjoint cycle decomposition has cycle lengths $a_{1},a_{2},\\dots,a_{r}$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{r} a_{i}=10$, then the order of the permutation is the least common multiple of these lengths:\n$$\n\\operatorname{ord}(\\sigma)=\\operatorname{lcm}(a_{1},a_{2},\\dots,a_{r}).\n$$\nThus the problem is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}(a_{1},\\dots,a_{r})$ subject to $\\sum a_{i}=10$ and $a_{i}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 1}$.\n\nTo obtain a large $\\operatorname{lcm}$, we should include cycle lengths that contribute large prime powers while keeping the sum small. In particular, including a factor $5$ in the $\\operatorname{lcm}$ requires that one of the cycle lengths be divisible by $5$, i.e., contain a $5$-cycle or a $10$-cycle. A single $10$-cycle uses all $10$ points and yields order $10$, which is not maximal, so we focus on including a $5$-cycle.\n\nWith one cycle of length $5$, the remaining lengths must sum to $5$. Enumerating the partitions of $5$ and their least common multiples:\n- $5$: $\\operatorname{lcm}=5$,\n- $4+1$: $\\operatorname{lcm}=4$,\n- $3+2$: $\\operatorname{lcm}=6$,\n- $3+1+1$: $\\operatorname{lcm}=3$,\n- $2+2+1$: $\\operatorname{lcm}=2$,\n- $1+1+1+1+1$: $\\operatorname{lcm}=1$.\n\nThe maximum possible $\\operatorname{lcm}$ from the remaining $5$ points is $6$, achieved by the partition $3+2$. Since $5$ is coprime to both $3$ and $2$, the overall order is the product:\n$$\n\\operatorname{lcm}(5,3,2)=5\\cdot 3\\cdot 2=30.\n$$\n\nWe must also argue that no larger order is possible. If no cycle length is divisible by $5$, then the overall $\\operatorname{lcm}$ is not divisible by $5$. The largest such $\\operatorname{lcm}$ under the sum constraint $10$ is at most $21$, achieved by the partition $7+3$ with $\\operatorname{lcm}(7,3)=21$; combinations involving $8$ or $9$ cannot pair with $3$ or $2$ without exceeding the sum $10$, and partitions like $6+4$ or $4+3+3$ only yield $12$. Therefore any order exceeding $21$ must include a factor $5$, and as shown above the best achievable with a $5$-cycle is $30$.\n\nAn explicit permutation attaining this order is one with disjoint cycle type $(5)(3)(2)$, for example, a $5$-cycle, a $3$-cycle, and a $2$-cycle on disjoint supports, whose order is $\\operatorname{lcm}(5,3,2)=30$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible order in $S_{10}$ is $30$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "1783292"}]}
