Any even-length cycles in $\\sigma^2$ must arise in pairs of the same length, coming from even-length cycles in $\\sigma$ that are twice as long. In particular, a single $k$-cycle with $k$ even cannot appear alone in $\\sigma^2$.\n2. In $S_6$, the only possible cycle lengths of $\\sigma$ are in $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.

The cycle decomposition of $\\pi$ contains one $4$-cycle and one $2$-cycle. By the analysis above, no square $\\sigma^2$ in $S_6$ can have a $4$-cycle, so it is impossible that $\\sigma^2=\\pi$. Equivalently, the necessary condition that, for each even cycle length $k$, the number of $k$-cycles in $\\pi$ must be even (because they arise in pairs under squaring) is violated here: $\\pi$ has one $4$-cycle and one $2$-cycle, both counts odd.\n\nTherefore, no square root $\\sigma \\in S_6$ exists with $\\sigma^2=\\pi$.
