This degree is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{6}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The number $\\sqrt{6}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 6 = 0$.

The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$, none of which are roots of the polynomial. Since $x^2 - 6$ is a degree-2 polynomial with no rational roots, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $x^2 - 6$ is the minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{6}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.

The right-hand side is a rational number ($2ab$) multiplied by an irrational number ($\\sqrt{6}$). The only way a rational number can equal an irrational number multiplied by a rational is if both sides are zero.\nThis implies two conditions must hold:\n1. $2ab = 0$\n2. $15 - a^2 - 6b^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the first condition, $2ab=0$, we must have either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nCase 1: $a=0$. The second equation becomes $15 - 6b^2 = 0$, which implies $6b^2 = 15$, so $b^2 = \\frac{15}{6} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This would mean $b = \\pm\\sqrt{5/2}$, which is not a rational number. This contradicts our definition of $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nCase 2: $b=0$. The second equation becomes $15 - a^2 = 0$, which implies $a^2 = 15$. This would mean $a = \\pm\\sqrt{15}$, which is not a rational number. This contradicts our definition of $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBoth cases lead to a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that $\\sqrt{15} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$ is false.\nSince $\\sqrt{15}$ is not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$, the polynomial $x^2 - 15$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$ and is thus irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.
