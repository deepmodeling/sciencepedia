If it has no rational roots, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to find all possible rational roots of $P(x)$. The theorem states that if a rational number $p/q$ (in lowest terms) is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, then the numerator $p$ must be a divisor of the constant term and the denominator $q$ must be a divisor of the leading coefficient.\nFor $P(x) = x^3 - 6x + 2$:\nThe constant term is 2.
