The additive identity (the zero element) in this ring is the ideal $I = \\langle x^4 - 9 \\rangle$. We are searching for two distinct non-zero elements $\\alpha, \\beta \\in R$ such that their product is the zero element, i.e., $\\alpha \\beta = 0_R$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be represented by the polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ from $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, respectively. The elements are equivalence classes, so we can write $\\alpha = [p(x)]$ and $\\beta = [q(x)]$.\nThe conditions on $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can be translated as follows:\n1.  $\\alpha \\neq 0_R$ means that $p(x)$ is not in the ideal $I$. In other words, $p(x)$ is not a multiple of $x^4 - 9$.\n2.  $\\beta \\neq 0_R$ means that $q(x)$ is not in the ideal $I$. In other words, $q(x)$ is not a multiple of $x^4 - 9$.\n3.  $\\alpha \\beta = 0_R$ means that $[p(x)][q(x)] = [p(x)q(x)] = 0_R$. This implies that the product $p(x)q(x)$ is in the ideal $I$, meaning $p(x)q(x)$ is a multiple of $x^4 - 9$.\n\nThese conditions suggest that $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are factors of $x^4-9$. Let's factor the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - 9$ over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe polynomial is a difference of squares:\n$$x^4 - 9 = (x^2)^2 - 3^2 = (x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3)$$\nLet's choose our polynomial representatives to be these factors:\nLet $p(x) = x^2 - 3$ and $q(x) = x^2 + 3$.\n\nNow, we must verify that the corresponding ring elements $\\alpha = [p(x)]$ and $\\beta = [q(x)]$ satisfy all the required conditions.\n1.  Is $\\alpha = [x^2 - 3]$ non-zero? Yes, because the polynomial $x^2 - 3$ has degree 2, it cannot be a multiple of the degree 4 polynomial $x^4 - 9$. Thus, $x^2 - 3 \\notin \\langle x^4 - 9 \\rangle$.\n2.  Is $\\beta = [x^2 + 3]$ non-zero? Yes, for the same reason, $x^2 + 3$ has degree 2 and cannot be a multiple of $x^4-9$. Thus, $x^2 + 3 \\notin \\langle x^4 - 9 \\rangle$.\n3.  Is their product zero in $R$? The product is $[(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3)] = [x^4 - 9]$. Since $x^4 - 9$ is the generator of the ideal, it belongs to the ideal. The equivalence class of any element in the ideal is the zero element of the quotient ring. Therefore, $[x^4 - 9] = 0_R$.\n4. The elements are distinct since the polynomials $x^2-3$ and $x^2+3$ are not in the same equivalence class (their difference is $(x^2+3)-(x^2-3)=6$, which is not a multiple of $x^4-9$).\n\nThe problem asks for representatives with the minimal possible positive degree. The representatives we found, $p(x) = x^2 - 3$ and $q(x) = x^2 + 3$, both have degree 2. Could there be zero divisors of a smaller positive degree, i.e., degree 1?\n\nLet's assume there exists a zero divisor represented by a linear polynomial, $ax+b$, where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $a \\neq 0$. Let this element be $\\gamma = [ax+b]$. For $\\gamma$ to be a zero divisor, there must exist a non-zero element $\\delta = [r(x)]$ such that $\\gamma\\delta = 0_R$. This means $(ax+b)r(x)$ is a multiple of $x^4-9$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain, any linear factor of $(ax+b)r(x)$ must also be a linear factor of $x^4-9$. This implies that $ax+b$ must be a factor of $x^4-9$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe roots of $x^4 - 9 = 0$ are $x = \\pm \\sqrt{3}$ and $x = \\pm i\\sqrt{3}$. None of these roots are rational numbers. Since the polynomial $x^4-9$ has no rational roots, it has no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, there cannot be a zero divisor represented by a polynomial of degree 1.\n\nThe lowest possible positive degree for a zero divisor in this ring is 2. Our chosen polynomials, $x^2-3$ and $x^2+3$, both have this minimal positive degree.\n\nThus, a valid ordered pair of polynomial representatives is $(x^2 - 3, x^2 + 3)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} x^{2} - 3 & x^{2} + 3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1821148"}]}
