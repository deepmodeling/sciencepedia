Your answer should be a polynomial in the variable $x$.", "solution": "Let $t$ be transcendental over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is the rational function field in one indeterminate over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Define $K = \\mathbb{Q}(t^{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(t)$.

Over a field, a monic quadratic is reducible if and only if it has a root in the field. Thus $f(x)$ is reducible over $K$ if and only if there exists $s \\in K$ such that $s^{2} = t^{2}$.\n\nSuppose there exists $s \\in K$ with $s^{2} = t^{2}$. Working in the overfield $\\mathbb{Q}(t)$, this implies $(s - t)(s + t) = 0$, hence $s = \\pm t$. But $s \\in K = \\mathbb{Q}(t^{2})$, whereas $t \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(t^{2})$: indeed, the $\\mathbb{Q}$-automorphism $\\sigma$ of $\\mathbb{Q}(t)$ defined by $\\sigma(t) = -t$ fixes $t^{2}$ and therefore fixes $K$, but sends $t$ to $-t$. If $t \\in K$, then applying $\\sigma$ would give $t = \\sigma(t) = -t$, hence $2t = 0$, which is impossible in characteristic $0$. Therefore no such $s \\in K$ exists with $s^{2} = t^{2}$.\n\nConsequently, $t^{2}$ is not a square in $K$, so $x^{2} - t^{2}$ has no root in $K$ and is irreducible in $K[x]$.
