This exercise [@problem_id:1802824] presents a classic scenario: the angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, which is itself easily constructible. By attempting to trisect it, we translate the geometric challenge into an algebraic one, investigating whether the number $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ is constructible. This practice is a cornerstone for understanding why a general method for trisection is impossible, as it demonstrates how the process can lead to an irreducible cubic polynomial whose roots are not constructible.", "problem": "In the context of classical geometry, a real number is considered **constructible** if, starting with a segment of unit length, a segment of that absolute length can be produced in a finite number of steps using only an unmarked straightedge and a compass. An angle $\\theta$ is defined as **constructible** if the number $\\cos(\\theta)$ is a constructible number. A fundamental theorem from abstract algebra states that a number $\\alpha$ is constructible if and only if it is algebraic over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the degree of the minimal field extension containing it, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$, is a power of 2.\n\nA student makes the following claim: \"If any given angle $\\theta$ is constructible, then the angle $\\theta/3$, obtained by trisecting $\\theta$, must also be constructible.\"\n\nEvaluate the student's claim. Which of the following statements provides the correct assessment?\n\nA. The claim is false. A counterexample is the angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$. This angle is constructible, but trisecting it requires constructing $\\cos(20^\\circ)$, which is a root of an irreducible cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies its minimal field extension has degree 3, which is not a power of 2.\n\nB. The claim is false. No angle can be trisected using a straightedge and compass because the construction would require solving a cubic equation, which is impossible with these tools.\n\nC. The claim is true. If an angle $\\theta$ is constructible, then $\\cos(\\theta)$ is a constructible number. Since the set of constructible numbers forms a field, and division by 3 is a valid operation, $\\cos(\\theta/3)$ must also be a constructible number.\n\nD. The claim is true. The ancient Greek geometers simply lacked the insight to find the general construction, but modern algebraic techniques have shown that such a construction is theoretically possible for any constructible angle.\n\nE. The claim is false. A counterexample is the angle $\\theta = 90^\\circ$. This angle is constructible, but trisecting it gives $30^\\circ$, and $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}/2$ requires a field extension of degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}$.", "solution": "To evaluate the student's claim, we must determine if there exists a constructible angle $\\theta$ for which the trisected angle $\\theta/3$ is not constructible. A famous candidate for such a counterexample is the trisection of a $60^\\circ$ angle.\n\nFirst, we verify if the angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ is constructible. According to the definition provided, an angle is constructible if its cosine is a constructible number. For $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The number $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a rational number, so it belongs to the field $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\frac{1}{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\frac{1}{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}:\\mathbb{Q}] = 1$. Since $1 = 2^0$, the degree is a power of 2. By the theorem stated in the problem, $\\cos(60^\\circ)$ is a constructible number, and therefore the angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ is constructible.\n\nNext, we investigate the constructibility of the trisected angle, $\\alpha = \\theta/3 = 60^\\circ/3 = 20^\\circ$. For this angle to be constructible, the number $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ must be a constructible number. To check this, we must find the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which will give us the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(20^\\circ)):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\nWe use the cosine triple-angle identity: $\\cos(3\\alpha) = 4\\cos^3(\\alpha) - 3\\cos(\\alpha)$.\nLet $\\alpha = 20^\\circ$. Then $3\\alpha = 60^\\circ$. Substituting these values into the identity gives:\n$\\cos(60^\\circ) = 4\\cos^3(20^\\circ) - 3\\cos(20^\\circ)$\n\nWe know that $\\cos(60^\\circ) = 1/2$. Let $x = \\cos(20^\\circ)$. The equation becomes:\n$\\frac{1}{2} = 4x^3 - 3x$\nMultiplying by 2 and rearranging the terms gives a polynomial equation for $x$:\n$1 = 8x^3 - 6x$\n$8x^3 - 6x - 1 = 0$\n\nSo, $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ is a root of the polynomial $P(x) = 8x^3 - 6x - 1$. To find the degree of the minimal extension, we must check if this polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is, then it is the minimal polynomial for $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ (up to a constant factor), and the degree of the extension will be 3.\n\nWe use the Rational Root Theorem to check for rational roots. Any rational root of $P(x)$ must be of the form $p/q$, where $p$ is an integer divisor of the constant term $(-1)$ and $q$ is an integer divisor of the leading coefficient (8).\nThe possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{4}, \\pm \\frac{1}{8}$.\nWe test these possibilities:\n$P(1) = 8(1)^3 - 6(1) - 1 = 1 \\neq 0$\n$P(-1) = 8(-1)^3 - 6(-1) - 1 = -8 + 6 - 1 = -3 \\neq 0$\n$P(1/2) = 8(1/2)^3 - 6(1/2) - 1 = 8(1/8) - 3 - 1 = 1 - 3 - 1 = -3 \\neq 0$\n$P(-1/2) = 8(-1/2)^3 - 6(-1/2) - 1 = 8(-1/8) + 3 - 1 = -1 + 3 - 1 = 1 \\neq 0$\nSince none of the possible rational values are roots, the cubic polynomial $P(x) = 8x^3 - 6x - 1$ has no rational roots. A cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means that $P(x)$ is the minimal polynomial for $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of this minimal polynomial is 3. Consequently, the degree of the field extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(20^\\circ)):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$.\n\nAccording to the constructibility theorem, a number is constructible only if the degree of its minimal extension is a power of 2. Since the degree is 3, which is not a power of 2, the number $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ is not constructible. This implies that the angle $20^\\circ$ is not constructible.\n\nWe have found a constructible angle ($\\theta = 60^\\circ$) for which the trisected angle ($\\theta/3 = 20^\\circ$) is not constructible. This serves as a direct counterexample to the student's claim, proving it to be false.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- A correctly identifies $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ as a counterexample and provides the correct reasoning based on the degree of the field extension for $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ being 3, which is not a power of 2.\n- B is incorrect because it makes a sweeping claim that no angle can be trisected. For instance, an angle of $90^\\circ$ is constructible, and its trisection, $30^\\circ$, is also constructible since $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}/2$, and $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, which is a power of 2.\n- C is incorrect because it misinterprets the field operations. Division by 3 in the field of constructible numbers would apply to a number like $\\cos(\\theta)$, resulting in $\\cos(\\theta)/3$, which is not the same as $\\cos(\\theta/3)$.\n- D is incorrect; the impossibility of a general trisection method is a proven mathematical fact, not a failure of insight.\n- E is incorrect as it uses a faulty counterexample. As shown in the analysis of B, $30^\\circ$ is a constructible angle, so $\\theta=90^\\circ$ is not a valid counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct assessment is given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1802824"}, {"introduction": "Having established that not all constructible angles can be trisected, it's important to ask: are *any* non-trivial angles trisectible?
