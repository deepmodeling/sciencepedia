Matrix multiplication in $M_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is not associative.", "solution": "A Principal Ideal Domain must be a commutative integral domain. Thus, to show a ring is not a PID, it is sufficient to show it is not an integral domain or not commutative.\n\nFirst, $M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ has zero-divisors, so it is not an integral domain. Consider the nonzero matrix\n$$\nN=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nN^{2}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\cdot 0+1\\cdot 0 & 0\\cdot 1+1\\cdot 0 \\\\ 0\\cdot 0+0\\cdot 0 & 0\\cdot 1+0\\cdot 0 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nThus $N\\neq 0$ and $N^{2}=0$, so $N$ is a zero-divisor. Therefore, $M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is not an integral domain. This validates option A.\n\nSecond, $M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ does have a multiplicative identity, namely the identity matrix\n$$\nI_{2}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nwhich satisfies $I_{2}A=AI_{2}=A$ for all $A\\in M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$. Hence option B is false.\n\nThird, $M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is not commutative under matrix multiplication. For instance, let\n$$\nA=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad B=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nAB=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}=B,\n$$\nbut\n$$\nBA=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nThus $AB\\neq BA$, proving noncommutativity. Hence option C is true.\n\nFourth, the set of all matrices with determinant $0$ (the singular matrices) does not form an ideal in $M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$, because it is not closed under addition. For example,\n$$\nS_{1}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad S_{2}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nboth have determinant $0$, but\n$$\nS_{1}+S_{2}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}=I_{2},\n$$\nwhich is invertible and hence not singular. Therefore, option D is false.\n\nFifth, matrix multiplication in $M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is associative: for all $A,B,C\\in M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$,\n$$\n(AB)C=A(BC),\n$$\na standard property inherited from the bilinearity and associativity of multiplication in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Hence option E is false.\n\nCombining these, the fundamental properties that prevent $M_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ from being a PID are that it is not an integral domain (it has zero-divisors) and it is not commutative.
