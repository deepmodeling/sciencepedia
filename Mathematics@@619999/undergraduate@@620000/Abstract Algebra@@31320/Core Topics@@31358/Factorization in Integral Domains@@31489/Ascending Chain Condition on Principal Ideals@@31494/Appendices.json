Ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ correspond to divisors of $n$: for each divisor $d \\mid n$, the ideal generated by the class of $d$ is an ideal, and every ideal is of this form.

Let's try to find such an $r = (r_1, r_2, \\dots)$. The equation $a_n = a_{n+1} \\cdot r$ is equivalent to a system of component-wise equations: $(a_n)_i = (a_{n+1})_i \\cdot r_i$ for all $i \\ge 1$.\n\n- For $1 \\le i \\le n$: $(a_n)_i = 1$ and $(a_{n+1})_i = 1$. So we need $1 = 1 \\cdot r_i$, which implies $r_i = 1$.\n- For $i = n+1$: $(a_n)_{n+1} = 0$ and $(a_{n+1})_{n+1} = 1$. So we need $0 = 1 \\cdot r_{n+1}$, which implies $r_{n+1} = 0$.\n- For $i > n+1$: $(a_n)_i = 0$ and $(a_{n+1})_i = 0$. So we need $0 = 0 \\cdot r_i$. This equation is satisfied for any $r_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$. We can simply choose $r_i = 0$.\n\nSo, we can construct an element $r$ whose components are $r_i=1$ for $1 \\le i \\le n$ and $r_i=0$ for $i > n$. This element is precisely $a_n$. Let's check if $r=a_n$ works: $a_{n+1} \\cdot a_n$.\nThe $i$-th component of this product is $(a_{n+1})_i \\cdot (a_n)_i$.\n- If $1 \\le i \\le n$: $(a_{n+1})_i = 1$ and $(a_n)_i = 1$. The product is $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n- If $i > n$: $(a_n)_i = 0$.

This means that $a_{n+1}$ is not an element of $(a_n)$. In other words, there is no element $s \\in R$ such that $a_{n+1} = a_n \\cdot s$.\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that such an $s$ exists. Then the equation $a_{n+1} = a_n \\cdot s$ must hold component-wise.\nLet's look at the $(n+1)$-th component:\n$(a_{n+1})_{n+1} = (a_n)_{n+1} \\cdot s_{n+1}$\nFrom our definitions, $(a_{n+1})_{n+1} = 1$ and $(a_n)_{n+1} = 0$.\nThe equation becomes $1 = 0 \\cdot s_{n+1}$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, $0 \\cdot s_{n+1}$ is always 0, regardless of whether $s_{n+1}$ is 0 or 1. So we have the contradiction $1 = 0$.\nThis contradiction implies that no such element $s$ can exist. Therefore, $a_{n+1} \\notin (a_n)$, which means $(a_{n+1}) \\not\\subseteq (a_n)$.\n\nSince $(a_n) \\subseteq (a_{n+1})$ and $(a_{n+1}) \\not\\subseteq (a_n)$, we have the strict inclusion $(a_n) \\subsetneq (a_{n+1})$.\nThis holds for any positive integer $n$. We have constructed an infinite, strictly ascending chain of principal ideals:\n$$ (a_1) \\subsetneq (a_2) \\subsetneq (a_3) \\subsetneq \\dots $$\nThis chain never stabilizes. Therefore, the ring $R = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{Z}_2$ does not satisfy the Ascending Chain Condition on principal ideals. This confirms that option C is the correct statement and justification.\n\nLet's briefly examine why the other options are incorrect:\nA. While $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a field and thus satisfies ACC (it only has two ideals, (0) and (1)), this property does not necessarily extend to infinite direct products. Our counterexample proves this.\nB. It is true that every element $x=(x_1, \\dots)$ in $R$ is idempotent, since $x^2 = (x_1^2, x_2^2, \\dots) = (x_1, x_2, \\dots) = x$ because $k^2 = k$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. However, this property does not guarantee that the ring satisfies the ACC. Rings with this property are called Boolean rings. Our counterexample shows that an infinite Boolean ring need not satisfy the ACC.\nD. It is true that $R$ has zero divisors. For example, $a_1 = (1, 0, 0, \\dots)$ and $b = (0, 1, 0, \\dots)$ are non-zero, but $a_1 \\cdot b = (0, 0, 0, \\dots)$, the zero element. However, the presence of zero divisors does not preclude a ring from satisfying ACC. For instance, the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ has zero divisors (e.g., $2 \\cdot 3 = 0$) but is a finite ring, so any chain of ideals must be finite in length and thus must stabilize. Therefore, containing zero divisors is not a valid reason for the failure of ACC.\n\nThe only correct conclusion is that the ring fails the ACC on principal ideals because a strictly ascending infinite chain can be constructed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1777986"}]}
