This ring is a notable example of a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), which is an integral domain where every ideal is principal (i.e., can be generated by a single element).\n\nLet $I$ and $J$ be two ideals in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ defined by their generators as follows:\n$$I = (x^2 - 4)$$\n$$J = (x^2 + x - 6)$$\nThe intersection of these two ideals, $I \\cap J$, is also a principal ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Determine the unique monic polynomial that generates the ideal $I \\cap J$.", "solution": "Let $R$ be a Principal Ideal Domain (PID). A fundamental property of PIDs is that for any two elements $a, b \\in R$, the intersection of the principal ideals they generate, $(a) \\cap (b)$, is also a principal ideal generated by the least common multiple (lcm) of $a$ and $b$. That is, $(a) \\cap (b) = (\\text{lcm}(a,b))$.\n\nIn this problem, the PID is the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients, $R = \\mathbb{Q}[x]$. We are given two ideals, $I = (p(x))$ and $J = (q(x))$, where the generators are $p(x) = x^2 - 4$ and $q(x) = x^2 + x - 6$.\n\nAccording to the property mentioned above, the intersection $I \\cap J$ is the principal ideal generated by the least common multiple of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.\n$$I \\cap J = (p(x)) \\cap (q(x)) = (\\text{lcm}(p(x), q(x)))$$\nOur task is to find this lcm and ensure it is a monic polynomial. In a polynomial ring over a field like $\\mathbb{Q}$, the generator of a principal ideal is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero constant (a unit). Requiring the generator to be monic makes it unique.\n\nTo find the lcm of two polynomials, it is helpful to first find their prime factorizations. In $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, irreducible polynomials act as prime elements.\n\nFirst, we factor the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - 4$. This is a difference of squares:\n$$p(x) = x^2 - 2^2 = (x - 2)(x + 2)$$\n\nNext, we factor the polynomial $q(x) = x^2 + x - 6$. We look for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to 1. These numbers are 3 and -2.\n$$q(x) = (x + 3)(x - 2)$$\n\nNow we have the factorizations:\n$p(x) = (x - 2)(x + 2)$\n$q(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)$\n\nThe least common multiple is found by taking the product of the highest powers of all distinct irreducible factors present in the factorizations of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. The distinct factors are $(x-2)$, $(x+2)$, and $(x+3)$. The highest power for each of these factors in either factorization is 1.\n\nTherefore, the lcm is:\n$$\\text{lcm}(p(x), q(x)) = (x-2)^{1} (x+2)^{1} (x+3)^{1}$$\n\nNow, we expand this expression to find the polynomial generator:\n$$\\text{lcm}(p(x), q(x)) = ((x-2)(x+2))(x+3)$$\n$$= (x^2 - 4)(x+3)$$\n$$= x^2(x+3) - 4(x+3)$$\n$$= x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12$$\n\nThe resulting polynomial, $x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12$, is the generator of the ideal $I \\cap J$. We must check if it is monic. A polynomial is monic if its leading coefficient (the coefficient of the highest-degree term) is 1. The leading term is $x^3$, and its coefficient is 1. Thus, the polynomial is monic.\n\nThis is the unique monic polynomial that generates the ideal $I \\cap J$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x^{3} + 3x^{2} - 4x - 12}$$", "id": "1801044"}, {"introduction": "To truly appreciate the significance of a property, it is often instructive to examine a case where it fails. While the implication PID $\\implies$ UFD is a cornerstone of ring theory, not all integral domains are Unique Factorization Domains (UFDs). This practice problem [@problem_id:1801043] investigates the subring of polynomials $k[x^2, x^3]$, a classic example where an element can have fundamentally different factorizations into irreducibles. Engaging with this exercise will sharpen your ability to test for the UFD property and understand its boundaries.", "problem": "Let $k$ be a field. Consider the set $R$ of all polynomials $p(x)$ in the polynomial ring $k[x]$ such that the coefficient of the linear term ($x^1$) in $p(x)$ is zero. It can be verified that this set $R$ forms a subring of $k[x]$.\n\nFor context, recall the following definitions for a commutative ring with identity. An integral domain is a ring with no zero divisors. A Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) is an integral domain where every non-zero, non-unit element has a unique factorization into irreducible elements (up to order and associates). A Principal Ideal Domain (PID) is an integral domain where every ideal is generated by a single element. A Euclidean Domain (ED) is an integral domain that admits a Euclidean function.

First, $R$ is a subring of $k[x]$: for $p(x),q(x)\\in R$, the coefficient of $x$ in $p(x)+q(x)$ is $0+0=0$, and the coefficient of $x$ in $p(x)q(x)$ equals the sum of products of coefficients whose degrees add to $1$, namely the constant term of one times the linear coefficient of the other plus the linear coefficient of one times the constant term of the other; both linear coefficients are zero, so the result is $0$. Hence $R$ is closed under addition and multiplication and contains $1$, so it is a unital subring.\n\nSince $k[x]$ is an integral domain and $R$ is a subring of $k[x]$ with the same multiplication, $R$ has no zero divisors: if $a,b\\in R$ and $ab=0$ in $R$, then $ab=0$ in $k[x]$, and since $k[x]$ is a domain, either $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore $R$ is an integral domain.\n\nNext, identify $R$ as $k[x^{2},x^{3}]$. For any $n\\geq 2$, if $n$ is even, then $x^{n}=(x^{2})^{n/2}\\in k[x^{2},x^{3}]$; if $n$ is odd, then $n=3+2m$ for some $m\\geq 0$, so $x^{n}=x^{3}(x^{2})^{m}\\in k[x^{2},x^{3}]$. Thus every monomial $x^{n}$ with $n\\geq 2$ lies in $k[x^{2},x^{3}]$, and constants lie in $k[x^{2},x^{3}]$ as well, so $R\\subseteq k[x^{2},x^{3}]$. Conversely, every element of $k[x^{2},x^{3}]$ is a $k$-linear combination of monomials $x^{2a+3b}$ with $2a+3b\\geq 2$, hence has zero $x^{1}$-coefficient, so $k[x^{2},x^{3}]\\subseteq R$. Therefore $R=k[x^{2},x^{3}]$.\n\nThe units of $R$ are exactly the nonzero constants from $k$, as in $k[x]$, because any nonconstant polynomial has positive degree and cannot have a multiplicative inverse that is a polynomial. In $R$, any non-unit must have degree at least $2$ because the $x^{1}$-term is forbidden. Hence if $f,g\\in R$ are non-units, then $\\deg f\\geq 2$ and $\\deg g\\geq 2$, which implies\n$$\n\\deg(fg)=\\deg f+\\deg g\\geq 4.\n$$\nIt follows that $x^{2}$ is irreducible in $R$: if $x^{2}=fg$ with $f,g\\in R$, then at least one of $f$ or $g$ must be a unit, since otherwise $\\deg(fg)\\geq 4$ contradicts $\\deg x^{2}=2$. The same argument shows $x^{3}$ is irreducible, because any factorization into non-units would force $\\deg(fg)\\geq 4\\neq 3$.\n\nNow consider $x^{6}\\in R$. It has two factorizations in $R$:\n$$\nx^{6}=(x^{2})^{3}=(x^{3})^{2}.\n$$\nBoth $x^{2}$ and $x^{3}$ are irreducible and are not associates (units are constants, and no constant multiplies $x^{2}$ to $x^{3}$). Hence these are distinct factorizations into irreducibles. Therefore, $R$ is not a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\nWe have shown $R$ is an integral domain but not a UFD.
