We are given that $N(y) = -3$. Therefore, we need to find non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the Diophantine equation:\n$$a^2 - 7b^2 = -3$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $a^2$:\n$$a^2 = 7b^2 - 3$$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ must be integers, $a^2$ must be a perfect square. We are also given that $b$ must be a non-zero integer. We can test small non-zero integer values for $b$ and see if $7b^2 - 3$ results in a perfect square.\n\nLet's start by testing positive integer values for $b$.\n\nCase 1: $b = 1$.\nSubstituting $b=1$ into the equation for $a^2$:\n$$a^2 = 7(1)^2 - 3$$\n$$a^2 = 7 - 3$$\n$$a^2 = 4$$\nThis gives $a = \\pm 2$. Since $a$ must be non-zero, both $a=2$ and $a=-2$ are valid solutions.\n\nWe have found a pair of non-zero integers $(a,b)$ that satisfies the equation. For example, we can choose $(a, b) = (2, 1)$.\nLet's construct the element $y$ using these coefficients:\n$$y = a + b\\sqrt{7} = 2 + 1\\sqrt{7} = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$$\n\nLet's verify the norm of this element:\n$$N(2 + \\sqrt{7}) = (2)^2 - 7(1)^2 = 4 - 7 = -3$$\nThe norm is indeed -3, and the coefficients $a=2$ and $b=1$ are both non-zero. Thus, $y = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$ is a valid solution.\n\nOther possible solutions from this first case include:\n- For $(a, b) = (-2, 1)$, the element is $-2 + \\sqrt{7}$.\n- For $(a, b) = (2, -1)$, the element is $2 - \\sqrt{7}$.\n- For $(a, b) = (-2, -1)$, the element is $-2 - \\sqrt{7}$.\n\nThe problem asks for only one such element. We can provide any of these. We will choose the one with positive coefficients.\n\nFor completeness, let's check the next integer value for $b$.\nCase 2: $b=2$.\n$$a^2 = 7(2)^2 - 3$$\n$$a^2 = 7(4) - 3$$\n$$a^2 = 28 - 3$$\n$$a^2 = 25$$\nThis gives $a = \\pm 5$. Both are non-zero. So another possible element is $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$. Its norm is $N(5+2\\sqrt{7}) = 5^2 - 7(2^2) = 25 - 7(4) = 25-28 = -3$.
