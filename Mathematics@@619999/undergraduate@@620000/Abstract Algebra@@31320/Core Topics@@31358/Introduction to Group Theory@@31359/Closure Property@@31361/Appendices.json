The set $S$ is closed under matrix addition. This is because for any matrices $A, B \\in S$, the determinant of their sum, $\\det(A+B)$, must be zero since $\\det(A+B) = \\det(A) + \\det(B)$.\nB.

This exercise demonstrates how understanding an abstract property like closure can be instrumental in solving complex, multi-part problems [@problem_id:1782238].", "problem": "A square matrix $N$ is called nilpotent if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $N^k$ is the zero matrix.
