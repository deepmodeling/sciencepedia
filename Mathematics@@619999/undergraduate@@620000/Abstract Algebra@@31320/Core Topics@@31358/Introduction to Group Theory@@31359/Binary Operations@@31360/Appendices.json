Let $U$ be the set of the first 10 positive integers, $U = \\{1, 2, 3, ..., 10\\}$. Let $S = \\mathcal{P}(U)$ be the power set of $U$, which is the set of all subsets of $U$.\n\nA binary operation $*$ is defined on the set $S$ as the set union: for any two elements $A, B \\in S$, their combination is given by $A * B = A \\cup B$.\n\nTo analyze the algebraic properties of the structure $(S, *)$, we use the following standard definitions:\n1.  An element $e \\in S$ is called an identity element if for every element $A \\in S$, it holds that $A * e = e * A = A$.\n2.

No elements in $S$ possess an inverse.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which elements of the power set $S=\\mathcal{P}(\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\})$ have an inverse with respect to the binary operation of set union, $A * B = A \\cup B$.\n\nThe existence of an inverse for an element is contingent upon the existence of an identity element for the operation. Therefore, the first step is to determine if an identity element $e$ exists in $S$. According to the definition provided, an identity element $e$ must satisfy $A * e = A$ and $e * A = A$ for all $A \\in S$.\n\nSubstituting the definition of the operation $*$, we get the condition $A \\cup e = A$ for any subset $A$ of $U = \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. The union $A \\cup e$ contains all elements from $A$ and all elements from $e$. For this union to be equal to $A$, the set $e$ must not introduce any new elements not already in $A$. This must hold for *every* choice of $A \\in S$.\n\nLet's test a specific case. If we choose $A = \\emptyset$ (the empty set, which is an element of the power set $S$), the condition becomes $\\emptyset \\cup e = \\emptyset$. This implies that the set $e$ must also be the empty set, since if $e$ contained any element $x$, the union would be $\\{x\\}$, which is not $\\emptyset$.\nSo, if an identity element exists, it must be $e = \\emptyset$.\n\nNow we must verify if $e = \\emptyset$ works for all $A \\in S$. For any set $A \\in S$, the union $A \\cup \\emptyset$ is the set of elements in $A$ or in $\\emptyset$. Since $\\emptyset$ has no elements, this is simply the set of elements in $A$. Thus, $A \\cup \\emptyset = A$. Since set union is commutative, $\\emptyset \\cup A = A$ is also true. Therefore, the identity element for the operation $*$ on the set $S$ is $e = \\emptyset$.\n\nHaving found the identity element, we can now investigate the existence of inverses. For an element $A \\in S$ to have an inverse $A^{-1} \\in S$, it must satisfy the condition $A * A^{-1} = e$.\n\nSubstituting the operation and the identity element we found, the condition becomes:\n$$A \\cup A^{-1} = \\emptyset$$\n\nThe union of two sets is the empty set if and only if both sets are themselves empty.\nFor the equation $A \\cup A^{-1} = \\emptyset$ to hold, it must be that $A = \\emptyset$ and $A^{-1} = \\emptyset$.\n\nThis shows that an inverse exists only for the element $A = \\emptyset$. In this case, the inverse of $\\emptyset$ is $\\emptyset$ itself, because $\\emptyset \\cup \\emptyset = \\emptyset$.\n\nLet's consider any non-empty set $A \\in S$. Since $A$ is non-empty, there exists at least one element $x$ such that $x \\in A$. For any other set $B \\in S$, the union $A \\cup B$ will contain all elements of $A$, so $x \\in (A \\cup B)$. Since the identity element $e=\\emptyset$ contains no elements, it is impossible for $A \\cup B$ to equal $\\emptyset$ if $A$ is non-empty. Consequently, no non-empty set in $S$ has an inverse under the operation of set union.\n\nThus, the only element in $S$ that possesses an inverse is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.

Since this is not true for all $a$, $*$ is not associative. Therefore A is false.\n\nTo test commutativity, compare $a*b \\equiv 5a+b$ and $b*a \\equiv 5b+a$. Equality for all $a,b$ would require $5a+b \\equiv 5b+a \\pmod{15}$, i.e., $4a \\equiv 4b \\pmod{15}$. Since $\\gcd(4,15)=1$, $4$ is a unit modulo $15$, so this implies $a \\equiv b \\pmod{15}$, which does not hold for arbitrary $a,b$. Hence $*$ is not commutative and B is false.\n\nFor identity elements, test $e=0$. Compute $0*a \\equiv 5\\cdot 0 + a \\equiv a$, so $0$ is a left identity. For the right identity condition, $a*0 \\equiv 5a+0 \\equiv 5a$, which equals $a$ for all $a$ only if $4a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{15}$, which forces $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{15}$ since $\\gcd(4,15)=1$. Thus $0$ is not a right identity, so it is not a two-sided identity. Statement C is false.\n\nTo determine whether any right identity exists, suppose $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{15}$ satisfies $a*r \\equiv a$ for all $a$. Then $5a + r \\equiv a \\pmod{15}$ for all $a$, which rearranges to $4a \\equiv -r \\pmod{15}$ for all $a$. As $a$ varies and since $4$ is a unit modulo $15$, the left-hand side attains all residues modulo $15$, which cannot equal a fixed $-r$. Therefore no right identity exists, and D is true.\n\nFinally, check left inverses with respect to the left identity $0$. For a given $a$, a left inverse $b$ must satisfy $b*a \\equiv 0$, i.e., $5b + a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{15}$, which is equivalent to $5b \\equiv -a \\pmod{15}$. This congruence has a solution $b$ if and only if $5$ divides $a$. Hence only $a \\in \\{0,5,10\\}$ have left inverses, and not every element does.
