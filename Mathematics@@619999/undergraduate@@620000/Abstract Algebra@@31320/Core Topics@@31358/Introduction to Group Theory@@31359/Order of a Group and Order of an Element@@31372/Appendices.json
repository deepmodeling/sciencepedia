The order of this element is given by the formula $\\text{ord}((g, h)) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g), \\text{ord}(h))$, where $\\text{ord}(g)$ is the order of the element $g$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ and $\\text{ord}(h)$ is the order of the element $h$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$. We are looking for the number of elements $(g, h)$ such that $\\text{ord}((g, h)) = 20$.\n\nLet $o_1 = \\text{ord}(g)$ and $o_2 = \\text{ord}(h)$. We need to find all pairs $(o_1, o_2)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2) = 20$.\n\nAccording to Lagrange's theorem, the order of an element in a finite group must divide the order of the group.\nThe possible orders $o_1$ for an element $g \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ are the positive divisors of 12. The set of divisors of 12 is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$.\nThe possible orders $o_2$ for an element $h \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ are the positive divisors of 10.

The prime factorization of 20 is $2^2 \\cdot 5^1$. For $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2)$ to equal 20, the highest power of 2 dividing either $o_1$ or $o_2$ must be $2^2=4$, and the highest power of 5 dividing either $o_1$ or $o_2$ must be $5^1=5$.\n\n1.  **Factor of 5**: The factor of 5 must come from $o_2$, since 12 (and its divisors) are not divisible by 5. Thus, $o_2$ must be a multiple of 5.

From the set of possible orders for $o_1$, this means $o_1 \\in \\{4, 12\\}$.\n\nNow we test the possible pairs $(o_1, o_2)$ from these restricted sets:\n- If $o_1=4$ and $o_2=5$, then $\\text{lcm}(4, 5) = 20$. This is a valid combination.\n- If $o_1=4$ and $o_2=10$, then $\\text{lcm}(4, 10) = 20$.

In a cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, the number of elements of order $d$ (where $d$ is a divisor of $n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, the number of elements of order 4 is $\\phi(4)$. Since $4=2^2$, $\\phi(4) = 4(1 - 1/2) = 2$.\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$, the number of elements of order 5 is $\\phi(5)$. Since 5 is prime, $\\phi(5) = 5-1 = 4$.\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$, the number of elements of order 10 is $\\phi(10)$. Since $10=2 \\cdot 5$, $\\phi(10) = \\phi(2)\\phi(5) = (2-1)(5-1) = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$.\n\nNow we calculate the number of elements for each case.\nCase 1: $\\text{ord}(g)=4$ and $\\text{ord}(h)=5$.\nThe number of choices for $g$ is $\\phi(4)=2$.\nThe number of choices for $h$ is $\\phi(5)=4$.\nThe total number of such elements $(g, h)$ is $\\phi(4) \\times \\phi(5) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nCase 2: $\\text{ord}(g)=4$ and $\\text{ord}(h)=10$.\nThe number of choices for $g$ is $\\phi(4)=2$.\nThe number of choices for $h$ is $\\phi(10)=4$.\nThe total number of such elements $(g, h)$ is $\\phi(4) \\times \\phi(10) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nThe total number of elements of order 20 in $G$ is the sum of the counts from these two disjoint cases:\nTotal number = (Number from Case 1) + (Number from Case 2) = $8 + 8 = 16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "1811062"}, {"introduction": "Our exploration of order concludes in the non-abelian world of dihedral groups, specifically $D_6$, the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon.
