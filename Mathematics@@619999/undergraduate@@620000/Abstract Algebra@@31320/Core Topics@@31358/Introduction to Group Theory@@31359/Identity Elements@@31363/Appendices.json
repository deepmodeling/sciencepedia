This exercise challenges you to find the identity element for a novel binary operation defined on the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. By applying the fundamental definition of an identity element, $e * x = x$, to an unfamiliar context, you will solidify your understanding that the identity is a property of the specific algebraic operation, not just the set it acts upon [@problem_id:1801999].", "problem": "In a simplified model of quantum information processing, the \"combination\" of two numerical states is described by a custom binary operation.

This practice delves into the subtleties of what makes an identity element, exploring related concepts that can sometimes cause confusion. Using a simple, finite algebraic structure presented in a Cayley table, you will learn to distinguish between left identities, right identities, and two-sided identities, and see firsthand why an idempotent element (where $e * e = e$) is not necessarily an identity for the whole structure [@problem_id:1802006].", "problem": "Consider the set $S = \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}$ equipped with a binary operation $\\oplus$.
