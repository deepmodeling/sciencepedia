A Cayley table provides a complete visual representation of a finite group's structure, turning the abstract search for an inverse into a concrete task.

Which of the following statements describes a correct and general visual procedure for locating the inverse of any given element $g \\in G$ by inspecting the Cayley table?\n\nA. Find the element $g$ in the far-left header column. The inverse of $g$ is the element located on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) in that same row.\n\nB. Find the row corresponding to the element $g$. Scan across this row to find the identity element $e$. The inverse of $g$ is the element at the top of the column where $e$ was found.\n\nC. The inverse of an element $g$ (where $g \\neq e$) is the element that appears most frequently in the row corresponding to $g$.\n\nD. For any element $g$ in the far-left header column, its inverse is the element in the same position in the top header row (e.g., the inverse of the second element in the left column is the second element in the top row).\n\nE. Because the table is symmetric about its main diagonal, every element is its own inverse.", "solution": "In a group $(G, *)$ with identity element $e$, the inverse of an element $g \\in G$ is the unique element $g^{-1} \\in G$ such that\n$$\ng * g^{-1} = e \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g^{-1} * g = e.\n$$\nIn the Cayley table for $*$, the entry in the row labeled by $g$ and the column labeled by $x$ is exactly $g * x$. Therefore, to find $g^{-1}$, we must locate the unique $x$ such that $g * x = e$. Visually, this means: in the row corresponding to $g$, scan across to find the entry $e$; the column header of that position is $x = g^{-1}$. This directly implements the defining equation $g * g^{-1} = e$.\n\nUniqueness follows from the group axioms: if $g * x = e$ and $g * y = e$, then by left cancellation in a group, $x = y$. Hence there is exactly one such column, so the procedure is well-defined.\n\nEquivalently, using $g^{-1} * g = e$, one may scan down the column of $g$ to find $e$; the row header of that position is again $g^{-1}$. Both descriptions are consistent because left and right inverses coincide in a group.\n\nChecking against the given table validates the rule. For instance, in the row of $a$, the entry $e$ appears in the column headed by $c$, so $a * c = e$ and hence $c = a^{-1}$. In the row of $b$, the entry $e$ appears in the column headed by $b$, so $b * b = e$ and $b = b^{-1}$. In the row of $c$, the entry $e$ appears in the column headed by $a$, so $c * a = e$ and $a = c^{-1}$. These are exactly the inverses expected from the group structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct general visual procedure is: find the row of $g$, locate $e$ in that row, and take the column header where $e$ appears. This matches option B. The other options fail in general: the main diagonal entry in the row of $g$ is $g * g$, not necessarily $e$ (contradicting A); picking the most frequent element in a row has no relation to inverses (contradicting C); matching positions of headers ignores the operation (contradicting D); and symmetry of the table indicates commutativity, not that every element is an involution (contradicting E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1806551"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to identify inverses, a crucial question arises: for any given element in a group, could there be more than one inverse?
