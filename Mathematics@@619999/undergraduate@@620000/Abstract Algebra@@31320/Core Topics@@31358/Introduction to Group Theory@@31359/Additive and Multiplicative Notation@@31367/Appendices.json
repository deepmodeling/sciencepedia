The two most common are multiplicative notation and additive notation. In multiplicative notation, the group operation is denoted by juxtaposition (e.g., $xy$), the inverse of an element $x$ is $x^{-1}$, and the identity is $e$. In additive notation, the operation is denoted by '+' (e.g., $x+y$), the inverse of $x$ is $-x$, and the identity is $0$.
