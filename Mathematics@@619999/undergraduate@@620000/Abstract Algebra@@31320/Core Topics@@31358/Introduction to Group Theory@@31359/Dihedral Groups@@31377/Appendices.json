Let's consider the dihedral group $D_6$, which is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon and has an order of 12. This group can be generated by two elements: a rotation $r$ and a reflection $s$. These generators satisfy the following relations:\n1. $r^6 = e$ (rotating by $360^\\circ$ is the identity)\n2. $s^2 = e$ (reflecting twice is the identity)\n3. $sr = r^{-1}s$ (a reflection followed by a rotation is equivalent to a rotation in the opposite direction followed by the same reflection)\n\nHere, $e$ denotes the identity element of the group.
