Right-multiplication by $s_{k}$ swaps the entries at positions $k$ and $k+1$. The only pair whose relative order changes under this operation is the pair of entries at positions $k$ and $k+1$, so $\\operatorname{inv}$ changes by exactly $1$ (it increases by $1$ if these two entries were in increasing order and decreases by $1$ if they were in decreasing order). Starting from the identity permutation $\\operatorname{id}$ with $\\operatorname{inv}(\\operatorname{id})=0$, any expression of $\\sigma$ as a product of $m$ adjacent transpositions yields $\\operatorname{inv}(\\sigma)\\leq m$, hence $\\ell(\\sigma)\\geq \\operatorname{inv}(\\sigma)$. Conversely, perform a bubble-sort procedure on $(\\sigma(1),\\dots,\\sigma(n))$ to sort it into $(1,2,\\dots,n)$ using adjacent swaps; each swap reduces the inversion number by exactly $1$, and after exactly $\\operatorname{inv}(\\sigma)$ swaps we reach the identity.
