This problem applies an analogue of the Integer Root Theorem to a polynomial with Gaussian integer coefficients. This exercise is a perfect first step beyond fields, as it requires you to master the concepts of divisibility, units, and norms within an integral domain that is not a field [@problem_id:1819371].", "problem": "Consider the ring of Gaussian integers, defined as $\\mathbb{Z}[i] = \\{a+bi \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.

List the roots as a row of complex numbers, ordered first by their real parts in ascending order, and then by their imaginary parts in ascending order for any ties.", "solution": "The problem asks for the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = x^3 + (1-i)x^2 + (1-2i)x - (1+i)$ that lie in the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nWe can use an extension of the Integer Root Theorem for polynomials over the ring of Gaussian integers. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain, if a monic polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has a root $z_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$, then $z_0$ must be a divisor of the constant term in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nThe constant term of $P(x)$ is $c_0 = -(1+i)$. We need to find all divisors of $-(1+i)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The divisors of $-(1+i)$ are the same as the divisors of $1+i$, since $-1$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nTo find the divisors of $1+i$, we first compute its norm. The norm of a Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is $N(a+bi) = a^2+b^2$.\n$$N(1+i) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2$$\nIf a Gaussian integer $d$ divides $1+i$, then its norm $N(d)$ must divide $N(1+i)=2$. Since the norm is a non-negative integer, the possible values for $N(d)$ are $1$ and $2$.\n\nCase 1: $N(d) = 1$.\nLet $d = a+bi$. Then $a^2+b^2=1$. The integer solutions $(a,b)$ are $(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)$. These correspond to the Gaussian integers $1, -1, i, -i$. These are the units of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nCase 2: $N(d) = 2$.\nLet $d = a+bi$. Then $a^2+b^2=2$. The integer solutions $(a,b)$ are $(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)$. These correspond to the Gaussian integers $1+i, 1-i, -1+i, -1-i$.\n\nThe set of all possible roots is the union of these two sets of divisors:\n$\\{1, -1, i, -i, 1+i, 1-i, -1+i, -1-i\\}$.\n\nNow we test these candidates by substituting them into $P(x)$.\n- $P(1) = 1^3 + (1-i)(1)^2 + (1-2i)(1) - (1+i) = 1 + 1-i + 1-2i - 1-i = 2-4i \\neq 0$.\n- $P(-1) = (-1)^3 + (1-i)(-1)^2 + (1-2i)(-1) - (1+i) = -1 + 1-i -1+2i -1-i = -2 \\neq 0$.\n- $P(i) = i^3 + (1-i)i^2 + (1-2i)i - (1+i) = -i + (1-i)(-1) + i-2i^2 - 1-i = -i -1+i + i+2 -1-i = 0$.\nSo, $x=i$ is a root.\n\nSince $x=i$ is a root, $(x-i)$ must be a factor of $P(x)$. We can perform polynomial division to find the other factors. Using synthetic division with the root $i$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\ni & 1 & 1-i & 1-2i & -1-i \\\\\n  &   & i     & i      & 1+i \\\\\n\\hline\n  & 1 & 1     & 1-i    & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe quotient is a quadratic polynomial $Q(x) = x^2 + x + (1-i)$. The remaining roots of $P(x)$ are the roots of $Q(x)$. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of $Q(x)$:\n$$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1-i)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4 + 4i}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3+4i}}{2}$$\nWe need to find the square root of the complex number $-3+4i$. Let $\\sqrt{-3+4i} = a+bi$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Squaring both sides gives $(a+bi)^2 = a^2-b^2 + 2abi = -3+4i$.\nEquating the real and imaginary parts:\n1) $a^2-b^2 = -3$\n2) $2ab = 4 \\implies ab=2$\nAlso, the magnitude must be equal: $|a+bi|^2 = a^2+b^2 = |-3+4i| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2+4^2} = \\sqrt{9+16}=\\sqrt{25}=5$.\n3) $a^2+b^2=5$\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n(1) + (3): $2a^2 = 2 \\implies a^2=1 \\implies a = \\pm 1$.\n(3) - (1): $2b^2 = 8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b = \\pm 2$.\nSince $ab=2 > 0$, $a$ and $b$ must have the same sign. Thus, the square roots are $1+2i$ and $-1-2i$.\n\nLet's use $1+2i$ for the $\\pm$ term in the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm (1+2i)}{2}$$\nThis gives two roots:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{-1 + (1+2i)}{2} = \\frac{2i}{2} = i$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{-1 - (1+2i)}{2} = \\frac{-2-2i}{2} = -1-i$$\nBoth roots, $i$ and $-1-i$, are in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nThe roots of $P(x)$ are $i$ (from the first step), and $i$ and $-1-i$ (from the quadratic factor). Thus the roots are $i$ (with multiplicity 2) and $-1-i$ (with multiplicity 1).\n\nThe problem asks for the distinct roots. The distinct roots are $i$ and $-1-i$.\nWe need to list them in ascending order, first by their real parts, and then by their imaginary parts.\nRoot 1: $-1-i$. Real part: $-1$. Imaginary part: $-1$.\nRoot 2: $i = 0+1i$. Real part: $0$. Imaginary part: $1$.\nSince $-1 < 0$, the first root in the list is $-1-i$. The second root is $i$.\nThe ordered list of distinct roots is $(-1-i, i)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1-i & i \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1819371"}, {"introduction": "Now we will witness a dramatic departure from the behavior of polynomials over fields.
