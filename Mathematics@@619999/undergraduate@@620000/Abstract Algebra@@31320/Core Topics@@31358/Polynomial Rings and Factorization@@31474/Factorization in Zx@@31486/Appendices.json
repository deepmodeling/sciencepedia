We can connect this to the existence of linear factors using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, $a_n x^n + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$, any rational root $p/q$ (in lowest terms) must satisfy the conditions that $p$ divides the constant term $a_0$ and $q$ divides the leading coefficient $a_n$.\n\nIn our case, $f(x)$ is monic, so its leading coefficient is $a_5 = 1$. According to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root $p/q$ must have $q$ as a divisor of 1. This means $q$ can only be $1$ or $-1$. Therefore, any rational root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients must be an integer ($p/q = p/\\pm 1 = \\pm p$).\n\nThe problem states that $f(x)$ has no integer roots. From our reasoning above, this implies that $f(x)$ has no rational roots either.\n\nBy the Factor Theorem, a polynomial has a root $c$ if and only if $(x-c)$ is a factor. Since $f(x)$ has no rational roots, it cannot have any linear factors of the form $(x-c)$ where $c$ is a rational number. By Gauss's Lemma, if a polynomial with integer coefficients can be factored into polynomials with rational coefficients, it can also be factored into polynomials with integer coefficients. Thus, the absence of linear factors in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ implies the absence of linear factors in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\nA linear factor is a polynomial of degree 1. Since $f(x)$ has no linear factors, none of its irreducible factors $p_i(x)$ can have a degree of 1.\n\nWe can now re-examine the possible partitions of 5 for the degrees of the irreducible factors:\n- $4 + 1$: This includes a factor of degree 1, so it is ruled out.\n- $3 + 2$: This partition does not include a factor of degree 1. Both factors have degrees greater than 1. This is a possible combination.\n- $3 + 1 + 1$: This includes factors of degree 1, so it is ruled out.\n- $2 + 2 + 1$: This includes a factor of degree 1, so it is ruled out.\n- $2 + 1 + 1 + 1$: This includes factors of degree 1, so it is ruled out.\n- $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$: This includes factors of degree 1, so it is ruled out.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is the partition $3+2$. This means that $f(x)$ must factor into two irreducible polynomials, one of degree 2 and one of degree 3. An example of such a polynomial is $f(x) = (x^2 + 1)(x^3 + x + 1)$. This polynomial is monic, has degree 5, and has no rational (and therefore no integer) roots. Both $x^2+1$ and $x^3+x+1$ are irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\nTherefore, the degrees of the irreducible factors must be 2 and 3.
