This first exercise provides a foundational application of this principle. By considering the intersection of two subgroups, which is itself a subgroup, we can use the prime order of the parent subgroups to deduce the size of their common ground [@problem_id:1784971].", "problem": "Let $G$ be a group with an identity element $e$. Suppose that $H$ and $K$ are two distinct subgroups of $G$. The order of a group or subgroup is the number of elements it contains. It is given that both $H$ and $K$ have an order of 13. Determine the order of the intersection of these two subgroups, denoted as $H \\cap K$.", "solution": "Let $G$ be a group and $H,K \\leq G$ with $|H|=|K|=13$. Since $H \\cap K$ is a subgroup of both $H$ and $K$, by Lagrange's theorem its order divides $|H|=13$. Because $13$ is prime, the only possible orders are $1$ or $13$.\n\nIf $|H \\cap K|=13$, then $H \\cap K=H=K$, contradicting that $H$ and $K$ are distinct.

Let the identity operator be $e$.\n\nA central claim of this proposed protocol is that every operator $x \\in G$, with the exception of the identity operator $e$, is its own inverse. That is, for any $x \\in G$ where $x \\neq e$, applying the operator twice is equivalent to the identity operation, so $x * x = e$.\n\nSuppose we select two distinct operators, $a$ and $b$, from the set $G$, ensuring that neither $a$ nor $b$ is the identity operator $e$.
