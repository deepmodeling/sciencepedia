An element of $G$ is an ordered pair $(a, b)$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_6$. The group operation is component-wise addition, so for $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \\in G$, their sum is $(a_1 + a_2 \\pmod 4, b_1 + b_2 \\pmod 6)$.\n\nLet $S$ be a subset of $G$ defined as follows:\n$$S = \\{(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\mid a+b \\text{ is an even integer}\\}$$\nFor the condition that '$a+b$ is an even integer', $a$ and $b$ are taken as their standard integer representatives in the sets $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, respectively.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the set $S$?\n\nA. $S$ is not a subgroup because it is not closed under the group operation.\n\nB. $S$ is a subgroup of order 6.\n\nC. $S$ is a subgroup of order 12.\n\nD. $S$ is not a subgroup because it does not contain the identity element.\n\nE. $S$ is a subgroup of order 8.", "solution": "To determine if $S$ is a subgroup of $G = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6$, we use the subgroup test. A non-empty subset $S$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup if and only if it is closed under the group operation and closed under taking inverses.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition for an element $(a,b)$ to be in $S$. The condition is that the sum of the integer representatives, $a+b$, is an even integer. An integer sum is even if and only if the integers have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).\nSo, $(a, b) \\in S$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are both even, or $a$ and $b$ are both odd.\n\nWe apply the three steps of the subgroup test:\n\n1.  **Identity Element:** The identity element of $G$ is $(0, 0)$. For this element, $a=0$ and $b=0$. Both are even integers. Their sum is $0+0=0$, which is an even integer. Therefore, the identity element $(0,0)$ is in $S$. This shows $S$ is non-empty and also proves that option D is false.\n\n2.  **Closure under Addition:** Let $x = (a_1, b_1)$ and $y = (a_2, b_2)$ be two arbitrary elements in $S$.\n    The sum is $z = x+y = (a_1+a_2 \\pmod 4, b_1+b_2 \\pmod 6)$. Let's denote the components of $z$ as $a_3 = a_1+a_2 \\pmod 4$ and $b_3 = b_1+b_2 \\pmod 6$.\n    To check if $z \\in S$, we must verify if $a_3 + b_3$ is an even integer.\n    The integer representation of $a_3$ is either $a_1+a_2$ or $a_1+a_2-4$. In both cases, $a_3$ has the same parity as $a_1+a_2$ because 4 is even. Similarly, $b_3$ has the same parity as $b_1+b_2$.\n    Since $x \\in S$, $a_1$ and $b_1$ have the same parity.\n    Since $y \\in S$, $a_2$ and $b_2$ have the same parity.\n    The parity of $a_3$ is the parity of $a_1+a_2$. The parity of $b_3$ is the parity of $b_1+b_2$.\n    The parity of a sum depends on the parity of the operands. Let $\\text{par}(k)$ denote the parity of an integer $k$. Then $\\text{par}(k_1+k_2) \\equiv \\text{par}(k_1) + \\text{par}(k_2) \\pmod 2$.\n    So, $\\text{par}(a_3) \\equiv \\text{par}(a_1) + \\text{par}(a_2) \\pmod 2$.\n    And $\\text{par}(b_3) \\equiv \\text{par}(b_1) + \\text{par}(b_2) \\pmod 2$.\n    Since $\\text{par}(a_1) = \\text{par}(b_1)$ and $\\text{par}(a_2) = \\text{par}(b_2)$, it follows that:\n    $\\text{par}(b_3) \\equiv \\text{par}(a_1) + \\text{par}(a_2) \\pmod 2$.\n    Therefore, $\\text{par}(a_3) = \\text{par}(b_3)$, which means $a_3$ and $b_3$ are either both even or both odd. This implies their sum $a_3+b_3$ is even.\n    Thus, $z \\in S$, and $S$ is closed under the group operation. This proves that option A is false.\n\n3.  **Closure under Inverses:** Let $x=(a,b) \\in S$. The inverse of $x$ in $G$ is $-x = (-a \\pmod 4, -b \\pmod 6)$. Let's call the components of the inverse $a' = -a \\pmod 4$ and $b' = -b \\pmod 6$.\n    We need to check if $a'+b'$ is an even integer.\n    The representative for $a'$ is $4-a$ if $a \\neq 0$, and 0 if $a=0$. The representative for $b'$ is $6-b$ if $b \\neq 0$, and 0 if $b=0$.\n    The sum $a'+b'$ can be written as $a'+b' = (4k_1-a) + (6k_2-b) = 4k_1+6k_2 - (a+b)$, where $k_1, k_2$ are either 0 or 1.\n    Since $x=(a,b) \\in S$, we know that $a+b$ is an even integer. The term $4k_1+6k_2$ is always even. The difference of two even integers is even. Thus, $a'+b'$ is an even integer.\n    Therefore, $-x \\in S$. $S$ is closed under taking inverses.\n\nSince $S$ satisfies all three conditions of the subgroup test, $S$ is a subgroup of $G$.\n\nNow, we must find the order of $S$, which is the number of elements it contains. We count the elements $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ have the same parity.\nThe elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n- Even integers: $\\{0, 2\\}$ (2 elements)\n- Odd integers: $\\{1, 3\\}$ (2 elements)\n\nThe elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n- Even integers: $\\{0, 2, 4\\}$ (3 elements)\n- Odd integers: $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$ (3 elements)\n\nWe have two disjoint cases for an element $(a,b)$ to be in $S$:\n- Case 1: Both $a$ and $b$ are even. The number of choices for $a$ is 2, and for $b$ is 3. The number of such pairs is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n- Case 2: Both $a$ and $b$ are odd. The number of choices for $a$ is 2, and for $b$ is 3. The number of such pairs is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nThe total number of elements in $S$ is the sum of the counts from these two cases: $|S| = 6 + 6 = 12$.\nSo, $S$ is a subgroup of order 12.
