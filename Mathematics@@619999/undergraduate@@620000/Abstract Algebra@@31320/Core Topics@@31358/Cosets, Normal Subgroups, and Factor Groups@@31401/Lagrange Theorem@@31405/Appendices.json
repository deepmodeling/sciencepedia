Lagrange's Theorem states that for any finite group $G$, the order (number of elements) of any subgroup $H$ of $G$ must be a divisor of the order of $G$. Mathematically, if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $|H|$ divides $|G|$.\n\nIn this problem, the order of the group is $|G| = pq$. Therefore, the order of any subgroup $H$ must be a positive integer divisor of $pq$. Our task is to find all the positive integer divisors of the number $pq$.\n\nThe number $pq$ is a product of two distinct prime numbers, $p$ and $q$. By the definition of a prime number, the only positive divisors of $p$ are $1$ and $p$. Similarly, the only positive divisors of $q$ are $1$ and $q$.\n\nTo find the divisors of the product $pq$, we consider all possible products of the divisors of $p$ and the divisors of $q$.\nThe set of divisors of $p$ is $\\{1, p\\}$.\nThe set of divisors of $q$ is $\\{1, q\\}$.\n\nThe divisors of $pq$ are:\n1.  $1 \\times 1 = 1$\n2.  $1 \\times q = q$\n3.  $p \\times 1 = p$\n4.  $p \\times q = pq$\n\nThus, the set of all positive divisors of $pq$ is $\\{1, p, q, pq\\}$.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, these are the only possible orders for a subgroup of $G$. It is also worth noting that subgroups of these orders are guaranteed to exist. The subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element. The subgroup of order $pq$ is the group $G$ itself. By Cauchy's Theorem (a consequence of Sylow's Theorems), if a prime $k$ divides the order of a group, then the group has a subgroup of order $k$. Since $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes that divide $|G|$, there must exist subgroups of order $p$ and $q$. Therefore, all four orders are indeed possible.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. $\\{p, q\\}$: This set is incomplete. It omits the order of the trivial subgroup, which is 1, and the order of the group $G$ itself, which is $pq$.\nB. $\\{1, p, q\\}$: This set is incomplete. It omits the order of the group $G$ itself, which is $pq$. Every group is a subgroup of itself.\nC. $\\{1, p, q, p+q\\}$: This set is incorrect because $p+q$ is not generally a divisor of $pq$. For instance, if $p=2$ and $q=3$, then $|G|=6$. The set of possible subgroup orders is $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. However, this option suggests $\\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$, and 5 does not divide 6.\nD. $\\{1, p, q, pq\\}$: This set correctly lists all the divisors of $pq$. This is the complete set of all possible orders for a subgroup of $G$.\nE. $\\{1, p^2, q^2\\}$: This set is incorrect. Neither $p^2$ nor $q^2$ are divisors of $pq$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1627735"}, {"introduction": "While Lagrange's Theorem tells us which subgroup orders are possible, it doesn't guarantee that subgroups of all those orders exist.
