The factor group $G = \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ consists of cosets of the form $x + \\mathbb{Z}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The group operation in $G$ is addition, defined by $(x + \\mathbb{Z}) + (y + \\mathbb{Z}) = (x + y) + \\mathbb{Z}$. Two cosets $x + \\mathbb{Z}$ and $y + \\mathbb{Z}$ are considered equal if and only if $x - y$ is an integer.\n\nIn a simplified model of celestial mechanics, the positions of two objects, Object A and Object B, are described by elements in this group $G$. At any integer time $t > 0$, the position of Object A is represented by the coset $P_A(t) = (\\frac{3}{10}t) + \\mathbb{Z}$, and the position of Object B is represented by the coset $P_B(t) = (\\frac{1}{6}t) + \\mathbb{Z}$.

Let's call this integer $k$.\n$$ \\frac{2t}{15} = k $$\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $t$ that satisfies this condition. This implies $k$ must also be a positive integer. Rearranging the equation to solve for $t$, we get:\n$$ 2t = 15k $$\nSince 2 and 15 are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), for the product $2t$ to be a multiple of 15, $t$ must be a multiple of 15. This can be expressed as $t = 15m$ for some integer $m$.\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $t$. This corresponds to choosing the smallest positive integer value for $m$, which is $m=1$.\nSetting $m=1$, we find:\n$$ t = 15 \\cdot 1 = 15 $$\nThus, the first positive integer time at which the two objects are at the same position is $t=15$.\nTo verify, at $t=15$:\n$P_A(15) = \\frac{3}{10}(15) + \\mathbb{Z} = \\frac{45}{10} + \\mathbb{Z} = \\frac{9}{2} + \\mathbb{Z} = 4.5 + \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$P_B(15) = \\frac{1}{6}(15) + \\mathbb{Z} = \\frac{15}{6} + \\mathbb{Z} = \\frac{5}{2} + \\mathbb{Z} = 2.5 + \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe difference is $4.5 - 2.5 = 2$, which is an integer.

An element $gN$ in $G/N$ has order $k$ if $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that $(gN)^k = N$. This is equivalent to $g^k \\in N$, where $g^k$ means $g$ operated on itself $k$ times: $g \\Delta g \\Delta \\dots \\Delta g$.\n\nA key property of the symmetric difference operation is that for any set $A$, $A \\Delta A = (A \\setminus A) \\cup (A \\setminus A) = \\emptyset \\cup \\emptyset = \\emptyset$.
