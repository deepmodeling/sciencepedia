This is equivalent to checking if for every $h \\in H$ and every $g \\in D_4$, the element $ghg^{-1}$ is also in $H$. It is sufficient to check this condition for a set of generators of $D_4$, which are $r$ and $s$.\n\nFirst, we analyze subgroups for which normality can be established by general theorems.\n\nA. $H_1 = \\{e\\}$: The trivial subgroup, containing only the identity element, is always normal in any group. For any $g \\in D_4$, $geg^{-1} = gg^{-1} = e \\in H_1$. Thus, $H_1$ is normal.\n\nJ. $H_{10} = D_4$: A group is always a normal subgroup of itself. For any $g \\in D_4$, $gD_4g^{-1}$ is simply a permutation of the elements of $D_4$, resulting in the set $D_4$. Thus, $H_{10}$ is normal.\n\nG. $H_7 = \\{e, r, r^2, r^3\\}$: This is the cyclic subgroup generated by $r$, denoted $\\langle r \\rangle$. Its order is $|H_7| = 4$. The index of this subgroup in $D_4$ is $|D_4|/|H_7| = 8/4 = 2$. A fundamental theorem in group theory states that any subgroup of index 2 is normal. Therefore, $H_7$ is normal.\n\nF. $H_6 = \\{e, r^2\\}$: This subgroup is the center of $D_4$, denoted $Z(D_4)$. The center consists of all elements that commute with every element of the group. The element $r^2$ commutes with all powers of $r$. We check if it commutes with $s$: $sr^2 = s(rr) = (sr)r = (r^3s)r = r^3(sr) = r^3(r^3s) = r^6s = r^2s$. Since $sr^2 = r^2s$, $r^2$ is in the center. No other non-identity element is in the center. The center of a group is always a normal subgroup. Thus, $H_6$ is normal.\n\nNow we analyze the remaining subgroups by explicit conjugation. This is most efficiently done by examining the conjugacy classes of the elements. Let's find the conjugates of the reflections.\n\nConsider the element $s \\in H_2$. We conjugate $s$ by the generator $r$:\n$rsr^{-1} = rsr^3$.\nUsing the relation $sr=r^3s$, we have $rs = sr^3$. So, $rsr^3 = (sr^3)r^3 = sr^6 = sr^2$.\nFrom our check for the center, we know $sr^2 = r^2s$. So, $rsr^{-1} = r^2s$.\nThe element $s$ is in $H_2 = \\{e, s\\}$, but its conjugate by $r$, which is $r^2s$, is not in $H_2$. Therefore, $H_2$ is not a normal subgroup.\n\nThis calculation reveals that $s$ and $r^2s$ are in the same conjugacy class. The set of reflections $\\{s, rs, r^2s, r^3s\\}$ splits into two conjugacy classes. Let's find the other one. Conjugating $rs \\in H_3$ by $r$:\nGeometrically, the element $rs$ can be interpreted as a reflection across the diagonal line $y=-x$. Conjugating this reflection by $r$ (a 90-degree rotation) rotates its axis of reflection by 90 degrees. The line $y=-x$ becomes the line $y=x$, which is the axis for the reflection $r^3s$. Thus, $r(rs)r^{-1} = r^3s$.\nSo, the conjugacy classes of the reflections are $\\{s, r^2s\\}$ and $\\{rs, r^3s\\}$.\n\nB. $H_2 = \\{e, s\\}$: Not normal, as $rsr^{-1}=r^2s \\notin H_2$.\nC. $H_3 = \\{e, rs\\}$: Not normal, as $r(rs)r^{-1}=r^3s \\notin H_3$.\nD. $H_4 = \\{e, r^2s\\}$: Not normal, as $r(r^2s)r^{-1} = s \\notin H_4$. (Conjugating $r^2s$ by $r$ gives $s$).\nE. $H_5 = \\{e, r^3s\\}$: Not normal, as $r(r^3s)r^{-1} = rs \\notin H_5$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the order 4 subgroups that are not cyclic.\nH. $H_8 = \\{e, r^2, s, r^2s\\}$: This subgroup is the union of two sets that are closed under conjugation: the center $Z(D_4) = \\{e, r^2\\}$ and the conjugacy class $\\{s, r^2s\\}$. As a union of conjugacy classes, it must be normal. Let's verify this by checking the generators.\nConjugating by $r$:\n$r\\{e, r^2, s, r^2s\\}r^{-1} = \\{rer^{-1}, rr^2r^{-1}, rsr^{-1}, r(r^2s)r^{-1}\\} = \\{e, r^2, r^2s, s\\} = H_8$.\nConjugating by $s$:\n$s\\{e, r^2, s, r^2s\\}s^{-1} = \\{ses^{-1}, sr^2s^{-1}, sss^{-1}, s(r^2s)s^{-1}\\}$.\nWe compute the conjugates of the non-trivial elements:\n- $sr^2s^{-1} = sr^2s = r^2s^2 = r^2$ (since $r^2 \\in Z(D_4)$).\n- $sss^{-1} = s$.\n- $s(r^2s)s^{-1} = s(r^2s)s = sr^2s^2 = sr^2 = r^2s$.\nThe resulting set is $\\{e, r^2, s, r^2s\\}$, which is $H_8$ itself.\nSince conjugation by the generators $r$ and $s$ maps the subgroup to itself, $H_8$ is normal.\n\nI. $H_9 = \\{e, r^2, rs, r^3s\\}$: This subgroup is the union of the center $Z(D_4) = \\{e, r^2\\}$ and the second conjugacy class of reflections, $\\{rs, r^3s\\}$. As a union of conjugacy classes, it is normal. Let's verify.\nConjugating by $r$:\n$r\\{e, r^2, rs, r^3s\\}r^{-1} = \\{e, r^2, r(rs)r^{-1}, r(r^3s)r^{-1}\\} = \\{e, r^2, r^3s, rs\\} = H_9$.\nConjugating by $s$:\n$s\\{e, r^2, rs, r^3s\\}s^{-1} = \\{e, r^2, s(rs)s^{-1}, s(r^3s)s^{-1}\\}$.\n- $s(rs)s^{-1} = srs = r^3s$.\n- $s(r^3s)s^{-1} = sr^3s = (sr)r^2s = (r^3s)r^2s = r^3(sr^2)s = r^3(r^2s)s = r^5s^2 = rs$.\nThe resulting set is $\\{e, r^2, r^3s, rs\\} = H_9$.\nSince conjugation by generators maps the subgroup to itself, $H_9$ is normal.\n\nSummary of Normal Subgroups:\n- A. $H_1$: Normal (trivial subgroup)\n- B. $H_2$: Not Normal\n- C. $H_3$: Not Normal\n- D. $H_4$: Not Normal\n- E. $H_5$: Not Normal\n- F. $H_6$: Normal (center)\n- G. $H_7$: Normal (index 2)\n- H. $H_8$: Normal\n- I. $H_9$: Normal\n- J. $H_{10}$: Normal (the group itself)\n\nThe normal subgroups are $H_1, H_6, H_7, H_8, H_9, H_{10}$.
