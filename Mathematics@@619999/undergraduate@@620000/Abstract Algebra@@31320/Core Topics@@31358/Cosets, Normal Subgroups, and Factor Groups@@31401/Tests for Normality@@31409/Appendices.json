A subgroup $H$ is normal in a group $K$ if for every element $k \\in K$, the conjugate subgroup $kHk^{-1}$ is equal to $H$. An equivalent and often more practical condition is that for every $k \\in K$ and every $h \\in H$, the element $khk^{-1}$ must also be an element of $H$.\n\nLet's apply this definition to our case. The larger group is $K = G \\times G$, and the subgroup is $H = \\{ (x, x) \\mid x \\in G \\}$.\n\nLet an arbitrary element from the group $G \\times G$ be $g' = (a, b)$, where $a, b \\in G$.\nLet an arbitrary element from the subgroup $H$ be $h' = (x, x)$, where $x \\in G$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of $g'$, which is $g'^{-1}$. In a direct product group, the inverse is found component-wise:\n$$g'^{-1} = (a, b)^{-1} = (a^{-1}, b^{-1})$$\n\nNow, we compute the conjugate element $g'h'g'^{-1}$:\n$$g'h'g'^{-1} = (a, b)(x, x)(a^{-1}, b^{-1})$$\n\nUsing the component-wise group operation of $G \\times G$, we get:\n$$g'h'g'^{-1} = (axa^{-1}, bxb^{-1})$$\n\nFor $H$ to be a normal subgroup, this resulting element, $(axa^{-1}, bxb^{-1})$, must belong to $H$ for all choices of $g' \\in G \\times G$ and $h' \\in H$. This means it must be true for all $a, b \\in G$ and all $x \\in G$.\n\nAn element belongs to the diagonal subgroup $H$ if and only if its first and second components are identical. Therefore, the condition for normality is:\n$$axa^{-1} = bxb^{-1}$$\nThis equality must hold for all $x \\in G$ and for all $a, b \\in G$.\n\nLet's analyze this condition. We can right-multiply by $b$ and left-multiply by $a^{-1}$ to isolate the conjugates of $x$:\n$$a^{-1}(axa^{-1})b = a^{-1}(bxb^{-1})b$$\n$$(a^{-1}a)x(a^{-1}b) = (a^{-1}b)x(b^{-1}b)$$\n$$x(a^{-1}b) = (a^{-1}b)x$$\n\nLet $c = a^{-1}b$. Since this must hold for *all* $a, b \\in G$, the element $c$ can effectively be any element in $G$. To see this, for any desired $c \\in G$, we can simply choose $a=e$ (the identity element) and $b=c$. Then $a^{-1}b = e^{-1}c = c$.\n\nSo, the condition for normality simplifies to the requirement that for any element $c \\in G$, the equality $xc = cx$ must hold for all $x \\in G$. This is precisely the definition of an element $c$ being in the center of the group, $Z(G)$.\n\nSince this must be true for every possible $c \\in G$, it means that every element of $G$ must commute with every other element of $G$. A group in which all elements commute is, by definition, an abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the diagonal subgroup $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G \\times G$ if and only if the group $G$ is abelian.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. False. If $G$ is non-abelian (like the symmetric group $S_3$), we can find elements $a,b,x$ such that $axa^{-1} \\neq bxb^{-1}$.\nB. True. This is the condition we derived.\nC. False. While all cyclic groups are abelian (and thus $H$ would be normal), not all abelian groups are cyclic (e.g., the Klein-4 group). So, normality does not require $G$ to be cyclic, only abelian. The condition \"if and only if\" makes this statement incorrect.\nD. False. The finiteness of the group is irrelevant to the algebraic property of commutativity. There exist finite non-abelian groups (e.g., $S_3$) and infinite abelian groups (e.g., $(\\mathbb{R}, +)$).\nE. False.
