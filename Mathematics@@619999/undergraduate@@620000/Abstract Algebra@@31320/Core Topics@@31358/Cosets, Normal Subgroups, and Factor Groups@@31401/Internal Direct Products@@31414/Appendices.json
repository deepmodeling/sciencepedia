A pair of subgroups, $H$ and $K$, form an internal direct product of $G$ if every element $g \\in G$ can be written uniquely as $g = h+k$, where $h \\in H$ and $k \\in K$.

We are seeking the number of unordered pairs of non-trivial subgroups $\\{H, K\\}$ of $G$ such that $G$ is the internal direct product of $H$ and $K$.\n\nThe conditions for $G$ to be the internal direct product of its subgroups $H$ and $K$ are:\n1.  $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $G$.\n2.  $G = H+K$.\n3.  $H \\cap K = \\{0\\}$.\n\nSince $G$ is a finite group, these conditions are equivalent to finding subgroups $H$ and $K$ such that $|G| = |H| \\cdot |K|$ and $H \\cap K = \\{0\\}$. In our case, this means we need to find subgroups $H$ and $K$ such that $|H| \\cdot |K| = 30$ and their intersection is the trivial subgroup.\n\nThe group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ is cyclic. A fundamental result concerning finite cyclic groups states that if $G$ is a cyclic group of order $n$, then $G$ can be decomposed as an internal direct product of two subgroups $H$ and $K$ if and only if their orders, $|H| = d_1$ and $|K| = d_2$, are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(d_1, d_2) = 1$, and their product is $n$, i.e., $d_1 d_2 = n$.\n\nFurthermore, for any divisor $d$ of the order of a finite cyclic group, there exists a unique subgroup of order $d$. Therefore, the problem of counting the pairs of subgroups $\\{H, K\\}$ is equivalent to counting the pairs of their orders $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$.\n\nThe task thus reduces to finding the number of unordered pairs of integers $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  $d_1 d_2 = 30$ (since $|G|=30$).\n2.  $\\gcd(d_1, d_2) = 1$.\n3.  $H$ and $K$ are non-trivial, which means their orders $d_1$ and $d_2$ must not be 1 (for the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$) or 30 (for the group $G$ itself). Since $d_1 d_2=30$, if $d_1 > 1$, then $d_2 = 30/d_1 < 30$. So the non-triviality condition simplifies to $d_1 > 1$ and $d_2 > 1$.\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to factor 30 into two coprime factors, both greater than 1.\nFirst, find the prime factorization of 30:\n$30 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5$.\n\nThe condition $\\gcd(d_1, d_2) = 1$ means that $d_1$ and $d_2$ share no common prime factors.
