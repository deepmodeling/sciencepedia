This first practice challenges you to think critically about how the properties of the component groups, $H$ and $K$, translate to the direct product group $G = H \\times K$. By evaluating several key statements, you will build a solid conceptual foundation, exploring the conditions under which $G$ is cyclic and clarifying the precise rule for calculating element orders [@problem_id:1793361].", "problem": "Let $H$ and $K$ be two non-trivial finite groups, and let $G$ be their external direct product, denoted as $G = H \\times K$.

A counterexample is $H \\cong C_2$ and $K \\cong C_2$. Then $G \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$ has order $4$, and every nonidentity element has order $2$, so there is no element of order $4$; hence $G$ is not cyclic. Therefore A is false.\n\nFor statement B: If $G$ is cyclic, say $G=\\langle (h,k)\\rangle$, then the projection maps $\\pi_H:G \\to H$ and $\\pi_K:G \\to K$ are surjective homomorphisms. Since the image of a cyclic group under a homomorphism is cyclic, $H=\\pi_H(G)=\\langle h\\rangle$ and $K=\\pi_K(G)=\\langle k\\rangle$ are both cyclic. Therefore B is true.\n\nFor statement C: The contrapositive of statement B is: if either $H$ or $K$ is not cyclic, then $G$ is not cyclic. In particular, if neither $H$ nor $K$ is cyclic, then $G$ cannot be cyclic. Therefore C is true.\n\nFor statement D: Let $\\operatorname{ord}(h)=m$ and $\\operatorname{ord}(k)=n$. Then\n$$ (h,k)^t = (e_H, e_K) \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad h^t = e_H \\text{ and } k^t = e_K. $$\nThe smallest positive integer $t$ satisfying both $m \\mid t$ and $n \\mid t$ is $t=\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$. Hence\n$$\\operatorname{ord}\\big((h,k)\\big)=\\operatorname{lcm}\\big(\\operatorname{ord}(h),\\operatorname{ord}(k)\\big),$$\nwhich is not always the product; it equals the product only when $m$ and $n$ are coprime. Therefore D is false.\n\nFor statement E: The existence of a normal subgroup isomorphic to $H$ with quotient isomorphic to $K$ only guarantees that $X$ is an extension of $K$ by $H$, which need not split as a direct product. A standard counterexample is $X=S_3$, which has a normal subgroup $A_3 \\cong C_3$ and quotient $S_3/A_3 \\cong C_2$, but $S_3$ is nonabelian, whereas $C_3 \\times C_2$ is abelian; hence $S_3 \\not\\cong C_3 \\times C_2$.

A common task in group theory is to determine the possible orders of elements within a group.

If $\\operatorname{ord}(a)=m$ and $\\operatorname{ord}(b)=k$, then the smallest such $n$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(m,k)$.
