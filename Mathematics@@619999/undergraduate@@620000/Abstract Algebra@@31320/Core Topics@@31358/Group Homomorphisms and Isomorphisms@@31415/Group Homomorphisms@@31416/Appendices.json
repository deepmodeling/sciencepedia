This practice problem demonstrates a cornerstone technique for cyclic groups, where a homomorphism is completely determined by where it sends a generator.

The domain group $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ is a cyclic group generated by the element $[1]_6$. A key property of homomorphisms on cyclic groups is that they are completely determined by the image of a generator.\n\nLet the image of the generator $[1]_6$ under $\\phi$ be some element in the codomain, say $\\phi([1]_6) = [a]_{10}$ for some integer $a$ where $0 \\le a < 10$. Once this image is defined, the image of any other element $[x]_6 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_6$ is fixed. Using the homomorphism property $\\phi(g^k) = (\\phi(g))^k$, which for additive groups is $\\phi(k \\cdot g) = k \\cdot \\phi(g)$, we have:\n$$ \\phi([x]_6) = \\phi(x \\cdot [1]_6) = x \\cdot \\phi([1]_6) = x \\cdot [a]_{10} = [xa]_{10} $$\nSo, each choice of $a$ from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$ defines a potential homomorphism.\n\nHowever, for $\\phi$ to be a well-defined group homomorphism, a crucial condition must be met. A fundamental theorem of group theory states that for any homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to H$ and any element $g \\in G$, the order of the image of $g$ must divide the order of $g$. In symbols, $\\text{ord}(\\phi(g))$ must divide $\\text{ord}(g)$.\n\nWe apply this condition to the generator $[1]_6$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_6$. The order of $[1]_6$ is $\\text{ord}([1]_6) = 6$. Therefore, the order of its image, $\\text{ord}(\\phi([1]_6)) = \\text{ord}([a]_{10})$, must divide 6.\n\nFurthermore, the image $\\phi([1]_6)=[a]_{10}$ is an element of the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element of a finite group must divide the order of the group. Thus, the order of $[a]_{10}$ must also divide the order of $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$, which is 10.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the order of $[a]_{10}$ must be a common divisor of 6 and 10. The positive divisors of 6 are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$ and the positive divisors of 10 are $\\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$. The common divisors are $\\{1, 2\\}$. So, the order of $[a]_{10}$ must be either 1 or 2.\n\nOur task now reduces to finding how many elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ have an order of 1 or 2.\n1.  **Elements of order 1:** The only element in a group with order 1 is the identity element. In $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$, the identity element for addition is $[0]_{10}$. So, $a=0$ is a valid choice.

We already know its order is 1.\nThe element $[5]_{10}$ corresponds to $a=5$. Its order is 2, because $2 \\cdot [5]_{10} = [10]_{10} = [0]_{10}$, and $1 \\cdot [5]_{10} = [5]_{10} \\neq [0]_{10}$. Thus, $a=5$ is another valid choice. This choice defines the homomorphism $\\phi([x]_6) = [5x]_{10}$. There is one such element.\n\nIn total, the possible images for the generator $[1]_6$ are $[0]_{10}$ and $[5]_{10}$. Each of these choices uniquely determines a distinct homomorphism.\n- If $\\phi([1]_6) = [0]_{10}$, we get the trivial homomorphism.\n- If $\\phi([1]_6) = [5]_{10}$, we get a non-trivial homomorphism.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two distinct group homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1799656"}, {"introduction": "Homomorphisms reveal the deep structural properties of groups, including what connections are impossible.
