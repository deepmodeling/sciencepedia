The codomain of this homomorphism is the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. This means that for any rational number $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the value $\\phi(x)$ must be an integer.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of $\\phi$. A key property of a group homomorphism is that for any element $g$ in the domain and any integer $n$, we have $\\phi(n \\cdot g) = n \\cdot \\phi(g)$. In our additive group context, this is written as $\\phi(nx) = n\\phi(x)$.\n\nLet's define an integer $k = \\phi(1)$. Since $1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, its image $\\phi(1)$ must be an element of the codomain $\\mathbb{Z}$, so $k$ is an integer.\n\nNow, consider the element $1/2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We can write the integer $1$ as $1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$. Applying the homomorphism $\\phi$ to this equation gives:\n$$ \\phi(1) = \\phi\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nUsing the homomorphism property $\\phi(nx) = n\\phi(x)$, we have:\n$$ \\phi(1) = 2 \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting $k = \\phi(1)$, we get:\n$$ k = 2 \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nSince $\\phi(1/2)$ must be an integer, let's call it $m$. Then $k = 2m$. This equation implies that $k$, the value of $\\phi(1)$, must be an even integer. One might be tempted to conclude that any even integer is a possible value for $k$, which would imply $\\phi(1/2)=m$ could be any integer, leading to option A. However, we must consider other rational numbers.\n\nLet's generalize this argument. For any non-zero integer $n$, consider the rational number $1/n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We have the relation $n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = 1$. Applying the homomorphism $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi\\left(n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\phi(1) $$\n$$ n \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) = k $$\nThis means $\\phi(1/n) = k/n$. Since $\\phi(1/n)$ must be an integer for any non-zero integer $n$, it must be the case that $k/n$ is an integer for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is a very strong condition on $k$. It means that the integer $k$ must be divisible by every non-zero integer.\n\nThe only integer that is divisible by every non-zero integer (e.g., divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, ...) is the integer 0. Therefore, we must have $k=0$.\n\nSo, for any homomorphism $\\phi: (\\mathbb{Q}, +) \\to (\\mathbb{Z}, +)$, it must be that $\\phi(1) = 0$.\n\nNow we can determine the value of $\\phi(1/2)$. Using our earlier result:\n$$ k = 2 \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting $k=0$:\n$$ 0 = 2 \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\nThis shows that for any valid homomorphism $\\phi$, the value of $\\phi(1/2)$ must be 0. Thus, the set of all possible values for $\\phi(1/2)$ contains only the single element 0.\n\nThis reasoning also confirms that at least one such homomorphism exists: the trivial homomorphism, where $\\phi(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, satisfies all conditions. This rules out option E. Since the value must be 0, options A, B, and D are incorrect. The correct set of all possible values is $\\{0\\}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1816276"}]}
