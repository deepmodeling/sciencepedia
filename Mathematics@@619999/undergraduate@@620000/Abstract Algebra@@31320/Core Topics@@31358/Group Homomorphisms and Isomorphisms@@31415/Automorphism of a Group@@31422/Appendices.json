This group is generated by two elements: a rotation $r$ and a reflection $f$. The rotation $r$ corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by $\\pi/2$ radians, and the reflection $f$ is a reflection about a fixed axis. The group $D_4$ has eight elements and is defined by the relations $r^4 = e$, $f^2 = e$, and $rf = fr^3$, where $e$ is the identity element.

An element $x$ is a fixed point of $\\phi_r$ if it satisfies the equation $\\phi_r(x) = x$.\n\nBy the definition of the inner automorphism $\\phi_r$, this condition is $\\phi_r(x) = rxr^{-1}$. So, we are looking for the number of elements $x \\in D_4$ such that:\n$$rxr^{-1} = x$$\nMultiplying both sides by $r$ on the right, we get:\n$$(rxr^{-1})r = xr$$\n$$rx(r^{-1}r) = xr$$\n$$rxe = xr$$\n$$rx = xr$$\nThis means that an element $x$ is a fixed point of the inner automorphism $\\phi_r$ if and only if it commutes with $r$.

Therefore, the elements $e = r^0, r^1, r^2, r^3$ are all fixed points of $\\phi_r$.
