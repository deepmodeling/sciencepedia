We analyze both directions.\n($\\Rightarrow$) \"If $\\phi$ is an isomorphism, then $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$.\"\nAs established above, $\\phi$ is always an isomorphism. So this implication means that for any two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, it must be that $G_1 \\cong G_2$. This is false. Consider the counterexample $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2) and $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_3$ (the cyclic group of order 3). They are not isomorphic because they have different orders.

This implication means that for any two groups, at least one must be abelian. This is false. Consider the counterexample where $G_1 = S_3$ and $G_2 = S_3$, the symmetric group on 3 elements. Neither group is abelian. Yet, the swap map $\\phi: S_3 \\times S_3 \\to S_3 \\times S_3$ is an isomorphism.
