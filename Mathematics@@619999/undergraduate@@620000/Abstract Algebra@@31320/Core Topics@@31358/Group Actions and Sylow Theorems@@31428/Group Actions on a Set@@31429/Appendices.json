The identity transformation: It leaves everything unchanged, so it stabilizes $d_1$.\n2. Rotation by $180^\\circ$: This rotation maps each vertex of the square to its opposite vertex. A diagonal is defined by two opposite vertices, so this rotation maps the diagonal $d_1$ to itself.\n3. Reflection across the diagonal $d_1$: This reflection, by definition, leaves the line segment $d_1$ fixed.\n4.
