Its elements are given by the set $Q_8 = \\{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\\}$. The group operation follows these defining relations:\n$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$$\nThese relations, along with the fact that $-1$ commutes with all elements and $1$ is the identity, define the multiplication for all elements. For example, from $ijk = -1$, we can find $ij=k$ by right-multiplying by $k^{-1}=-k$.\n\nLet $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. The normalizer of $H$ in $G$, denoted $N_G(H)$, is defined as the set of all elements $g \\in G$ that leave $H$ unchanged under conjugation.
