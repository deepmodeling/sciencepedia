After learning that the order of any element must divide the order of the group (a consequence of Lagrange's theorem) and that if a prime $p$ divides the order of the group, there must be an element of order $p$ (Cauchy's theorem), Ben formulates the following general assertion:\n\n\"For any finite group $G$ of order $n$, if an integer $k > 1$ is a divisor of $n$, then there must exist an element in $G$ of order $k$.\"\n\nTo test this assertion, you are asked to consider the alternating group on four elements, $A_4$, which is the group of all even permutations of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.

Ben's assertion is correct. $A_4$ contains elements of order 2 and 3. By extension, since 4 and 6 are also divisors, it must contain elements of these orders as well.\n\nB. Ben's assertion is incorrect. While $A_4$ has order 12, it does not contain any element of order 6.\n\nC. Ben's assertion is incorrect. Cauchy's Theorem only guarantees an element of prime order, and 6 is not prime. However, since $4$ divides 12 and $4=2^2$ is a prime power, Sylow's theorems guarantee the existence of an element of order 4.\n\nD. Ben's assertion is correct. This is known as the converse of Lagrange's Theorem, which holds for all finite groups.\n\nE. Ben's assertion is incorrect. $A_4$ has order 12, but its only non-trivial proper subgroups are of order 2 and 3, which implies it cannot have an element of order 6.", "solution": "Ben’s assertion is the converse of Lagrange’s theorem and is false in general. To test it on $A_{4}$, note first that $|A_{4}|=12$ and the even permutations in $S_{4}$ are precisely:\n- the identity (order $1$),\n- the $3$-cycles (each can be written as a product of two transpositions, hence even, with order $3$),\n- the double transpositions $(ab)(cd)$ (each is a product of two disjoint transpositions, hence even, with order $2$).\n\nThus $A_{4}$ contains elements of orders $1$, $2$, and $3$. By Cauchy’s theorem, since $2$ and $3$ divide $12$, elements of orders $2$ and $3$ must exist, which is consistent with the above.\n\nNext, we show there are no elements of order $4$ or $6$ in $A_{4}$:\n- An element of order $4$ in $S_{4}$ must be a $4$-cycle. A $4$-cycle has sign $(-1)^{4-1}=-1$, so it is odd and not in $A_{4}$. Hence $A_{4}$ has no element of order $4$.\n- An element of order $6$ in a symmetric group must have disjoint cycle structure whose lengths have least common multiple $6$. In $S_{4}$ the only possible disjoint cycle types are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $2\\!+\\!2$, and $3\\!+\\!1$, whose orders are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $2$, and $3$, respectively. None has order $6$. Therefore $S_{4}$, and hence $A_{4}$, has no element of order $6$.\n\nTherefore, despite $6$ dividing $|A_{4}|$, there is no element of order $6$, so Ben’s assertion fails for $A_{4}$. Among the options, this is exactly stated by option B. Option C is incorrect because Sylow’s theorems guarantee a subgroup of order $4$ (indeed, $V_{4}\\cong C_{2}\\times C_{2}$) but not an element of order $4$. Option E is also incorrect because $A_{4}$ does have a proper subgroup of order $4$, namely the normal Klein four subgroup, so its premise is false even though its conclusion about order $6$ elements is true.
