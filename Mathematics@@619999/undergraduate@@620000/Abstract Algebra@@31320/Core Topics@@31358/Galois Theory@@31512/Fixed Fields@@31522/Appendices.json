This problem [@problem_id:1796338] challenges you to find a non-constant function in the fixed field of $\\mathbb{R}(x)$ under a specific automorphism. This practice introduces a powerful and general technique: creating symmetric expressions from the orbits of elements under the automorphism group, a foundational idea in Galois theory.", "problem": "Consider the field $\\mathbb{R}(x)$, which is the set of all rational functions in a single variable $x$ with coefficients from the field of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $\\sigma$ be a field automorphism of $\\mathbb{R}(x)$ such that it fixes every element of $\\mathbb{R}$ (i.e., $\\sigma(c)=c$ for all $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$) and maps the variable $x$ to $1-x$ (i.e., $\\sigma(x)=1-x$). The fixed field of this automorphism, denoted by $F$, consists of all rational functions $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}(x)$ that are left unchanged by the action of $\\sigma$, meaning $\\sigma(f(x)) = f(x)$.\n\nYour task is to find an example of a non-constant rational function that belongs to this fixed field $F$.

By definition, this means we need to find an $f(x)$ such that $\\sigma(f(x)) = f(x)$.\n\nLet's analyze the action of the automorphism $\\sigma$ on a general rational function $f(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials in $x$ with real coefficients. Since $\\sigma$ is a field automorphism and it fixes the real coefficients, its action on $f(x)$ is determined by its action on $x$:\n$$ \\sigma(f(x)) = \\sigma\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma(p(x))}{\\sigma(q(x))} = \\frac{p(\\sigma(x))}{q(\\sigma(x))} = \\frac{p(1-x)}{q(1-x)} $$\nThus, the condition for $f(x)$ to be in the fixed field, $\\sigma(f(x)) = f(x)$, translates to the condition:\n$$ \\frac{p(1-x)}{q(1-x)} = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} $$\nIn simpler terms, we are looking for a non-constant function $f(x)$ such that $f(1-x) = f(x)$.\n\nA general method to construct elements of a fixed field for a group of automorphisms is to take an element and \"average\" it over the group action. The group of automorphisms here is $G = \\langle \\sigma \\rangle$. Let's determine the order of this group by repeatedly applying $\\sigma$ to $x$:\n$$ \\sigma(x) = 1-x $$\n$$ \\sigma^2(x) = \\sigma(\\sigma(x)) = \\sigma(1-x) = 1-(1-x) = x $$\nSince $\\sigma^2$ maps $x$ to $x$ (and fixes $\\mathbb{R}$), $\\sigma^2$ is the identity automorphism. So, the group is $G = \\{\\text{id}, \\sigma\\}$, which is a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nWe can construct a fixed element by taking an arbitrary function $g(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}(x)$ and forming a symmetric combination under the group action. One such combination is the product of all elements in the orbit of $g(x)$ under $G$. Let's form the function $h(x) = g(x) \\cdot \\sigma(g(x))$. Let's check if $h(x)$ is in the fixed field:\n$$ \\sigma(h(x)) = \\sigma(g(x) \\cdot \\sigma(g(x))) = \\sigma(g(x)) \\cdot \\sigma^2(g(x)) = \\sigma(g(x)) \\cdot g(x) = h(x) $$\nThis confirms that any function of the form $g(x) \\cdot \\sigma(g(x))$ is in the fixed field $F$.\n\nNow, we need to choose a simple function $g(x)$ such that the resulting $h(x)$ is non-constant. Let's choose the simplest non-constant function, $g(x) = x$.\nUsing this choice, we construct our candidate function $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = g(x) \\cdot \\sigma(g(x)) = x \\cdot \\sigma(x) = x(1-x) $$\nLet's expand this expression:\n$$ f(x) = x - x^2 $$\nThis function is a polynomial, which is a type of rational function (with the denominator being the constant polynomial 1). It is clearly non-constant.\nAs a final check, let's verify that it satisfies the condition $f(1-x) = f(x)$:\n$$ f(1-x) = (1-x) - (1-x)^2 = (1-x) - (1 - 2x + x^2) = 1 - x - 1 + 2x - x^2 = x - x^2 $$\nSince $f(1-x) = f(x)$, the function $f(x) = x - x^2$ is indeed a non-constant element of the fixed field $F$. Other valid answers could be constructed similarly, for example by taking the sum $x^2 + \\sigma(x^2) = x^2 + (1-x)^2 = 2x^2 - 2x + 1$, or any rational function of $x-x^2$.
