The minimal polynomial of this element $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ will then be a candidate for $p(x)$. Let's choose the element $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3} + i$. It is an element of $K$. We will now find its minimal polynomial.\n\nStep 1: Find a polynomial with rational coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root.\nWe start with the equation $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3} + i$ and algebraically manipulate it to eliminate the irrational and imaginary parts.\n$$ \\alpha = \\sqrt{3} + i $$\nIsolate one of the terms, for instance $i$:\n$$ \\alpha - \\sqrt{3} = i $$\nSquare both sides to eliminate the imaginary unit:\n$$ (\\alpha - \\sqrt{3})^{2} = i^{2} $$\n$$ \\alpha^{2} - 2\\alpha\\sqrt{3} + 3 = -1 $$\nNow, isolate the remaining irrational term, $\\sqrt{3}$:\n$$ \\alpha^{2} + 4 = 2\\alpha\\sqrt{3} $$\nSquare both sides again to eliminate the square root:\n$$ (\\alpha^{2} + 4)^{2} = (2\\alpha\\sqrt{3})^{2} $$\n$$ \\alpha^{4} + 8\\alpha^{2} + 16 = 4\\alpha^{2} \\cdot 3 $$\n$$ \\alpha^{4} + 8\\alpha^{2} + 16 = 12\\alpha^{2} $$\nRearranging the terms gives us a polynomial equation with rational coefficients:\n$$ \\alpha^{4} - 4\\alpha^{2} + 16 = 0 $$\nThus, $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3} + i$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^{4} - 4x^{2} + 16$. This polynomial is monic and has rational coefficients.\n\nStep 2: Show that $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe can test for reducibility. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of $p(x)$ must be an integer divisor of 16. The divisors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm 16$. Checking these values reveals that none of them are roots. For example, $p(2) = 16 - 4(4) + 16 = 16 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $p(x)$ has no linear factors in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nThe only other possibility for factorization over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is into two quadratic factors:\n$$ x^{4} - 4x^{2} + 16 = (x^{2} + ax + b)(x^{2} + cx + d) $$\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Expanding the right side gives:\n$$ x^{4} + (a+c)x^{3} + (b+d+ac)x^{2} + (ad+bc)x + bd $$\nComparing coefficients with $x^{4} - 4x^{2} + 16$:\n1. $x^{3}$: $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$.\n2. $x^{1}$: $ad+bc = 0 \\implies ad-ab = 0 \\implies a(d-b) = 0$.\n3. $x^{0}$: $bd = 16$.\n4. $x^{2}$: $b+d+ac = -4 \\implies b+d-a^{2} = -4$.\n\nFrom condition 2, we have two cases:\nCase A: $a=0$. Then $c=0$. The factorization is $(x^{2}+b)(x^{2}+d)$. The coefficient equations become $b+d = -4$ and $bd=16$. The values $b$ and $d$ are roots of the quadratic equation $t^{2} - (b+d)t + bd = 0$, which is $t^{2} + 4t + 16 = 0$. The roots are $t = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-64}}{2} = -2 \\pm 2i\\sqrt{3}$, which are not rational numbers. So this case is impossible with $b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nCase B: $a \\neq 0$. Then $d-b=0 \\implies d=b$. From $bd=16$, we get $b^{2}=16$, so $b=\\pm 4$.\nIf $b = d = 4$, then from $b+d-a^{2}=-4$, we have $4+4-a^{2}=-4$, which gives $a^{2}=12$. This means $a=\\pm\\sqrt{12} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}$, which is not rational.\nIf $b = d = -4$, we have $-4-4-a^{2}=-4$, which gives $a^{2}=-4$. This means $a=\\pm 2i$, which is not rational.\nIn all cases, we cannot find rational coefficients $a, b, c, d$. Therefore, $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nStep 3: Verify that the splitting field of $p(x)$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i)$.\nThe polynomial is $p(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 16$. Let $L$ be its splitting field.\nTo find the roots of $p(x)$, we can treat it as a quadratic in $x^{2}$:\n$$ (x^{2})^{2} - 4(x^{2}) + 16 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula for $x^{2}$:\n$$ x^{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(16)}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{-48}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 4i\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 \\pm 2i\\sqrt{3} $$\nNow we need to find the square roots of these complex numbers. Let's check our primitive element's conjugates. The roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3}+i$ are its conjugates under the automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$. These automorphisms map $\\sqrt{3} \\to \\pm\\sqrt{3}$ and $i \\to \\pm i$. The conjugates are $\\sqrt{3}+i$, $\\sqrt{3}-i$, $-\\sqrt{3}+i$, and $-\\sqrt{3}-i$.\n\nLet's check if they are indeed the roots of $p(x)$.\n$(\\sqrt{3}+i)^{2} = 3+2i\\sqrt{3}-1 = 2+2i\\sqrt{3}$.\n$(\\sqrt{3}-i)^{2} = 3-2i\\sqrt{3}-1 = 2-2i\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo, two of the roots of $p(x)$ come from $x^{2} = 2+2i\\sqrt{3}$, giving $x=\\pm(\\sqrt{3}+i)$. The other two roots come from $x^{2} = 2-2i\\sqrt{3}$, giving $x=\\pm(\\sqrt{3}-i)$.\nThe four roots of $p(x)$ are $\\{\\sqrt{3}+i, -(\\sqrt{3}+i), \\sqrt{3}-i, -(\\sqrt{3}-i)\\}$.\nThis simplifies to $\\{\\sqrt{3}+i, -\\sqrt{3}-i, \\sqrt{3}-i, -\\sqrt{3}+i\\}$.\n\nThe splitting field $L$ is the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$ and all four of these roots.\nSince $\\sqrt{3}+i \\in L$ and $\\sqrt{3}-i \\in L$, their sum must also be in $L$: $(\\sqrt{3}+i) + (\\sqrt{3}-i) = 2\\sqrt{3} \\in L$. Since $L$ is a field, $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3} \\in L$.\nSimilarly, their difference must be in $L$: $(\\sqrt{3}+i) - (\\sqrt{3}-i) = 2i \\in L$. Thus, $i \\in L$.\nSince $\\sqrt{3} \\in L$ and $i \\in L$, any combination is in $L$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i) \\subseteq L$.\n\nConversely, all four roots are combinations of $\\sqrt{3}$ and $i$, so they are all elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i)$. This means the field generated by them must be a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i)$, i.e., $L \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i)$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i) \\subseteq L$ and $L \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i)$, we conclude that $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i)$.\n\nTherefore, $p(x) = x^{4} - 4x^{2} + 16$ is a monic, irreducible polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ whose splitting field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x^{4} - 4x^{2} + 16}$$", "id": "1792816"}, {"introduction": "Abstract algebra thrives on moving from specific computations to general structural truths.
