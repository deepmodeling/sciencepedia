The characteristic of this field is $p=3$.\n\nA polynomial $f(x) \\in F[x]$ is inseparable if it is irreducible over $F$ and its formal derivative, $f'(x)$, is the zero polynomial. In a field of characteristic $p>0$, the derivative $f'(x)$ is zero if and only if $f(x)$ is a polynomial in $x^p$. For our field $F=\\mathbb{F}_3(t)$, this means $f'(x)=0$ if and only if $f(x)$ is a polynomial in $x^3$. We will analyze each option based on these criteria.\n\n**Option A: $f(x) = x^5 - t$**\nFirst, we compute the formal derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^5 - t) = 5x^4$$\nIn the field $F$, the coefficient $5$ is congruent to $2$ modulo $3$. Thus, $f'(x) = 2x^4$.\nSince $f'(x) = 2x^4 \\neq 0$, this polynomial is separable (if it is irreducible). It cannot be an inseparable polynomial. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: $f(x) = x^3 - t^3$**\nWe need to check if this polynomial is irreducible. In a field of characteristic $p$, the \"Freshman's Dream\" identity holds: $(a \\pm b)^p = a^p \\pm b^p$. For our field with characteristic $3$, we have $(a-b)^3 = a^3 - b^3$.\nApplying this to our polynomial, we see that:\n$$f(x) = x^3 - t^3 = (x-t)^3$$\nSince $f(x)$ can be factored into $(x-t)(x-t)(x-t)$, it is a reducible polynomial over $F$. An inseparable polynomial must be irreducible. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: $f(x) = x^2 + 1$**\nFirst, we check for irreducibility. The coefficients of this polynomial lie in the subfield $\\mathbb{F}_3$. By Gauss's Lemma, if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3(t)$, it must be reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. A polynomial of degree 2 is reducible over a field if and only if it has a root in that field.

Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: $f(x) = x^6 - t$**\nFirst, we compute the formal derivative:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^6 - t) = 6x^5$$\nSince the characteristic of the field is 3, the coefficient $6$ is equal to $0$. Thus, $f'(x) = 0 \\cdot x^5 = 0$.\nThis means that if the polynomial is irreducible, it must be inseparable.\nNow, we must check for the irreducibility of $f(x) = x^6 - t$ over $F = \\mathbb{F}_3(t)$. We can view $f(x)$ as a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in the ring $\\mathbb{F}_3[t]$, and $F$ is the field of fractions of $\\mathbb{F}_3[t]$. The ring $\\mathbb{F}_3[t]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD). We can apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime element $p(t) = t \\in \\mathbb{F}_3[t]$.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = 1 \\cdot x^6 + 0 \\cdot x^5 + \\dots + 0 \\cdot x^1 - t$.\nThe coefficients are $a_6=1, a_5=\\dots=a_1=0, a_0=-t$.\n- The prime $t$ divides all coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_5$ because $a_0 = -t$ is divisible by $t$ and the others are zero.\n- The prime $t$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_6=1$.\n- The square of the prime, $t^2$, does not divide the constant term $a_0=-t$.\nAll conditions for Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied. Therefore, $f(x) = x^6 - t$ is irreducible over the field of fractions $\\mathbb{F}_3(t)$.\nSince $f(x)$ is irreducible and its derivative is zero, it is an inseparable polynomial.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1812933"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that imperfect fields like $\\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ give rise to inseparable polynomials, we can now investigate the structure of the field extensions they create.

Here, $c=t$. We must check if $t$ is a $p$-th power in $K = \\mathbb{F}_p(t)$.\n\nAssume for contradiction that $t$ is a $p$-th power in $K$. Then $t = \\left(\\frac{g(t)}{h(t)}\\right)^p$ for some coprime polynomials $g(t), h(t) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p[t]$. This gives $t \\cdot h(t)^p = g(t)^p$. Since $\\mathbb{F}_p[t]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain and $t$ is a prime element, $t$ dividing $g(t)^p$ implies $t$ must divide $g(t)$. Let $g(t) = t \\cdot k(t)$ for some polynomial $k(t)$.\n\nSubstituting this back gives $t \\cdot h(t)^p = (t \\cdot k(t))^p = t^p \\cdot k(t)^p$. Dividing by $t$ yields $h(t)^p = t^{p-1} \\cdot k(t)^p$. Since $p \\ge 2$, this implies $t$ divides $h(t)^p$, and thus $t$ must divide $h(t)$.\nWe have shown that $t$ divides both $g(t)$ and $h(t)$, which contradicts our assumption that they are coprime. Therefore, the initial assumption is false: $t$ is not a $p$-th power in $K$.\n\nAccording to the theorem, since $t$ is not a $p$-th power in $K$, the polynomial $f(x) = x^p - t$ is irreducible over $K$. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible and monic, and has $\\alpha$ as a root, it must be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$.\n\nThe degree of the field extension is the degree of the minimal polynomial.
