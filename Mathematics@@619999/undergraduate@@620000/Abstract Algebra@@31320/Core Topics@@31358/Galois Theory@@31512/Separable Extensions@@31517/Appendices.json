Hence $f$ does not factor as $(x^{2}+r)(x^{2}+s)$ with $r,s\\in\\mathbb{Q}$. Consider a general factorization into quadratics $(x^{2}+ax+b)(x^{2}-ax+c)$ with $a,b,c\\in\\mathbb{Q}$. Expanding gives $x^{4}+(b+c-a^{2})x^{2}+a(c-b)x+bc$. Matching the zero $x$-coefficient forces either $a=0$ or $b=c$. If $a=0$, then $(x^{2}+b)(x^{2}+c)$ leads to $b+c=-2$ and $bc=25$, which has no rational solutions since $t^{2}+2t+25=0$ has discriminant $-96$. If $b=c$, then the factorization is $(x^{2}+b)^{2}-a^{2}x^{2}$, which requires $b^{2}=25$ and $2b-a^{2}=-2$. For $b=5$ one gets $a^{2}=12\\notin\\mathbb{Q}$; for $b=-5$ one gets $a^{2}=-8$, impossible in $\\mathbb{Q}$.

Any repeated root would be a common root of $f$ and $f'$. Since $f(0)=25$, $f(1)=24$, and $f(-1)=24$, there is no common root, so $\\gcd(f,f')=1$ and $f$ has distinct roots.
