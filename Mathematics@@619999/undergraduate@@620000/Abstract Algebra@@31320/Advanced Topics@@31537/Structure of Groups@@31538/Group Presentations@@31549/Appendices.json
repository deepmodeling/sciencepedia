A primary question is: how many distinct elements does a presentation actually define?

A robust strategy involves finding an upper bound on the group's size by showing all elements simplify to a finite set of forms, and a lower bound by relating the abstract group to a familiar, concrete one like the symmetric group $S_3$.", "problem": "In abstract algebra, a group can be defined by a set of generators and a set of relations.

Let $G$ be a group defined by the presentation\n$$ G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2}=e, b^{2}=e, aba=bab \\rangle $$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the generators of the group, and $e$ is the identity element. The relations are the defining equations that the generators must satisfy. Any element of the group can be expressed as a finite sequence of generators and their inverses, often called a \"word\".\n\nDetermine the order of the group $G$. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.", "solution": "We are given the group $G=\\langle a,b \\mid a^{2}=e,\\ b^{2}=e,\\ aba=bab\\rangle$. First note that from the relations $a^2=e$ and $b^2=e$, we have $a^{-1}=a$ and $b^{-1}=b$. Thus, every group element can be represented by a word in the alphabet $\\{a,b\\}$ without inverses. We aim to show that there are at most six distinct elements and at least six distinct elements, hence exactly six.\n\nReduction to short alternating words:\n1) Using $a^2=e$ and $b^2=e$, any word can be freely reduced to an alternating word (i.e., with no adjacent $aa$ or $bb$).\n2) If an alternating word has length at least 4, it contains a subword like $abab$ or $baba$. Using the relation $aba=bab$, we can show that these words can be shortened:\n   - For $abab$:\n   $$abab=(aba)b=(bab)b=ba(b^2)=bae=ba$$\n   - For $baba$:\n   $$baba=b(aba)=b(bab)=b^2ab=eab=ab$$\n   In both cases, a word of length 4 reduces to a word of length 2. Repeating this process, any word can be reduced to one of length at most 3.\n3) Therefore, every element of $G$ is represented by one of the words of length at most 3:\n   $$e,\\ a,\\ b,\\ ab,\\ ba,\\ aba$$\n   Furthermore, since $bab=aba$ is a defining relation, no new element is generated. Thus, $|G|\\leq 6$.\n\nDeriving the Coxeter relation:\nLet's compute $(ab)^3$:\n$$(ab)^3 = ababab = (aba)(bab)$$\nBy the relation $aba=bab$, this becomes:\n$$(bab)(bab) = (bab)^2 = bab bab = ba(b^2)ab = ba(e)ab = baab = b(a^2)b = b(e)b = b^2 = e$$\nHence $(ab)^3=e$. The group $G$ satisfies the relations $a^2=e$, $b^2=e$, and $(ab)^3=e$, which is a presentation for the symmetric group $S_3$.\n\nExhibiting a surjective homomorphism to $S_3$:\nDefine a map $\\varphi:G\\to S_{3}$ by setting $\\varphi(a)=(12)$ and $\\varphi(b)=(23)$. We check that the relations hold for these images: $\\varphi(a)^2=(12)^2=e$ and $\\varphi(b)^2=(23)^2=e$. For the third relation:\n$$\\varphi(aba)=\\varphi(a)\\varphi(b)\\varphi(a)=(12)(23)(12)=(13)$$\n$$\\varphi(bab)=\\varphi(b)\\varphi(a)\\varphi(b)=(23)(12)(23)=(13)$$\nSince $\\varphi(aba)=\\varphi(bab)$, the relations are satisfied, and $\\varphi$ is a well-defined homomorphism. The elements $(12)$ and $(23)$ generate all of $S_3$, so $\\varphi$ is surjective. This implies that the order of $G$ must be at least the order of $S_3$, which is 6. Therefore, $|G|\\geq 6$.\n\nCombining bounds:\nWe have shown $|G|\\leq 6$ by word reduction and $|G|\\geq 6$ via the surjective homomorphism onto $S_{3}$. Therefore, we conclude that $|G|=6$.\n\nFor completeness, we can check that the images of our six representative words under $\\varphi$ are all distinct, confirming they are indeed distinct elements in $G$:\n$\\varphi(e)=e$, $\\varphi(a)=(12)$, $\\varphi(b)=(23)$, $\\varphi(ab)=(12)(23)=(123)$, $\\varphi(ba)=(23)(12)=(132)$, $\\varphi(aba)=(13)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1800217"}]}
