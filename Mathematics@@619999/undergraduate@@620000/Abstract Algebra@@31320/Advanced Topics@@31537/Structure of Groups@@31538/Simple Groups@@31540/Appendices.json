We must test this condition for each of the given subgroups of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the full multiplication table for the non-identity, non-negative elements. From $ijk = -1$, we can derive other relations.\n- Multiply by $k$ on the right: $ijk(k) = (-1)k \\implies ij(k^2) = -k \\implies ij(-1) = -k \\implies ij = k$.\n- From $ij=k$, we can find $ji$. Consider $ji(ij) = j(i^2)j = j(-1)j = -j^2 = -(-1) = 1$. So $(ji)^{-1} = ij=k$. The inverse of $k$ is $-k$ (since $k(-k) = -k^2 = -(-1)=1$), so $ji = -k$.\n- By cyclic permutation of $i, j, k$, we get all relations:\n  $ij=k, \\quad ji=-k$\n  $jk=i, \\quad kj=-i$\n  $ki=j, \\quad ik=-j$\nThe inverse of any element $x \\in \\{i, j, k, -i, -j, -k\\}$ is $-x$. For example, $i^{-1} = -i$.\n\nNow we check each subgroup:\n\n1.  **$S_1 = \\{1\\}$**: This is the trivial subgroup. For any $g \\in Q_8$, $g(1)g^{-1} = gg^{-1} = 1 \\in S_1$. Thus, the trivial subgroup is always normal.\n\n2.  **$S_6 = Q_8$**: The group itself is always a normal subgroup of itself. For any $g \\in Q_8$, $gQ_8g^{-1} = Q_8$. Thus, $S_6$ is normal.\n\n3.  **$S_2 = \\{1, -1\\}$**: This subgroup is the center of $Q_8$, denoted $Z(Q_8)$, which consists of all elements that commute with every element of $Q_8$. The center of any group is always a normal subgroup. To verify, let $h \\in S_2$. If $h=1$, $g(1)g^{-1}=1 \\in S_2$. If $h=-1$, $g(-1)g^{-1} = (-1)gg^{-1} = -1 \\in S_2$, because $-1$ commutes with all elements. So, $S_2$ is a normal subgroup.\n\n4.  **$S_3 = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$**, **$S_4 = \\{1, -1, j, -j\\}$**, and **$S_5 = \\{1, -1, k, -k\\}$**: These three subgroups all have order 4. The order of the group $Q_8$ is 8. The index of each of these subgroups is $|Q_8| / |S_n| = 8/4 = 2$ for $n=3,4,5$. A fundamental theorem in group theory states that any subgroup of index 2 is normal. Therefore, $S_3$, $S_4$, and $S_5$ are all normal subgroups of $Q_8$.\n\nFor completeness, let's explicitly check the normality of $S_3 = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$. We only need to check conjugation by elements not in $S_3$, such as $j$ and $k$.\n- For $g=j$: We need to check if $jhj^{-1} \\in S_3$ for all $h \\in S_3$.\n  - $j(1)j^{-1} = 1 \\in S_3$.\n  - $j(-1)j^{-1} = -1 \\in S_3$.\n  - $jij^{-1} = j(i)(-j) = (ji)(-j) = (-k)(-j) = kj = -i \\in S_3$.\n  - $j(-i)j^{-1} = -jij^{-1} = -(-i) = i \\in S_3$.\n  Since $jS_3j^{-1} = \\{1, -1, -i, i\\} = S_3$, the subgroup is normal under conjugation by $j$.\n- For $g=k$:\n  - $kik^{-1} = k(i)(-k) = (ki)(-k) = (j)(-k) = -jk = -i \\in S_3$.\n  - $k(-i)k^{-1} = i \\in S_3$.\nThe other elements of $S_3$ are in the center, so they are fixed. Thus $kS_3k^{-1}=S_3$.\nThe same logic applies to other elements like $-j, -k$. Therefore, $S_3$ is a normal subgroup. By the symmetry of the relations for $i,j,k$, the same arguments confirm that $S_4$ and $S_5$ are also normal.\n\nSince all subgroups $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5, S_6$ are normal in $Q_8$, the correct option is E.\n(A group where every subgroup is normal is called a Hamiltonian group. $Q_8$ is the smallest non-abelian Hamiltonian group.)", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1641467"}, {"introduction": "As group orders increase, checking every subgroup for normality becomes impractical. We must turn to more powerful tools like Sylow's theorems, which reveal deep structural information from a group's order alone.

We will investigate the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups for each of these primes.\n\nLet $n_p$ be the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups. According to Sylow's Third Theorem, $n_p$ must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $n_p$ must divide the index of the Sylow $p$-subgroup, which is $|G| / |P_p|$, where $P_p$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup.\n2.  $n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nLet's analyze $n_7$:\nA Sylow 7-subgroup has order 7.

The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, $n_2$, must divide $|G|/8 = 56/8 = 7$. The divisors of 7 are {1, 7}.\nAlso, $n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, which means $n_2$ must be odd. Both 1 and 7 are odd.\nCombining these two conditions, the only possible values for $n_2$ are 1 and 7.\n\nA key property relating Sylow subgroups to normal subgroups is that a Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal in $G$ if and only if it is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup, i.e., $n_p=1$. A group is simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial one and the group itself.\n\nWe will now use proof by contradiction to show that a group of order 56 cannot be simple. Assume $G$ is a simple group. If $G$ were simple, it would have no proper non-trivial normal subgroups. This would imply that none of its Sylow subgroups can be unique.\nTherefore, for a simple group $G$ of order 56, we must have $n_p > 1$ for all primes $p$ dividing $|G|$.\nFrom our analysis, this means we must have:\n$n_7 = 8$ and $n_2 = 7$.\n\nLet's count the number of elements this would imply.\nIf $n_7 = 8$, there are 8 distinct Sylow 7-subgroups. Each is of prime order 7, so the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 7-subgroups is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$. Each Sylow 7-subgroup contains $7-1=6$ elements of order 7.\nThe total number of elements of order 7 is $n_7 \\times (7-1) = 8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\nThese 48 elements, plus the identity element, account for 49 elements of $G$. The remaining elements in the group are $56 - 49 = 7$ elements (excluding the identity element). The total number of elements not of order 7 is $56-48=8$.\nThe elements whose order is a power of 2 must all reside in Sylow 2-subgroups. The remaining 8 elements (48 elements of order 7, plus these 8) must form the entire group. Among these 8 elements must be the identity, and the elements of the Sylow 2-subgroups.\nFor there to be a subgroup of order 8 (a Sylow 2-subgroup), these remaining 8 elements must form that subgroup.\nThis means there can be only one such subgroup of order 8. Thus, $n_2$ must be 1.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction. Our assumption that $G$ is simple led to the requirement that $n_2=7$, but the element counting argument concludes that if $n_7=8$, then $n_2$ must be 1. Therefore, the assumption that $G$ is simple is false. No group of order 56 can be simple.\n\nThis means that for any group $G$ of order 56, it must have a proper non-trivial normal subgroup. The original assumption that led to the contradiction was that *both* $n_7 > 1$ and $n_2 > 1$. Since this is false, at least one of them must be 1.\n-   Case 1: $n_7 = 1$. In this case, there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup. This subgroup is normal and has order 7.\n-   Case 2: $n_2 = 1$. In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. This subgroup is normal and has order 8.\n\nSince at least one of these cases must hold, any group of order 56 must have a normal subgroup of order 7 or a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\nA. $G$ is a simple group. This is false, as we have just proven.\nB. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups is 8, and the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 7. This is the scenario that leads to a contradiction and is therefore impossible.\nC. $G$ must be an abelian group. This is not necessarily true. For example, the dihedral group $D_{28}$, the group of symmetries of a 28-gon, has order 56 and is non-abelian.\nD. $G$ must contain a normal subgroup of order 7 or a normal subgroup of order 8. This is precisely what our analysis concluded. This statement is always true.\nE. $G$ must contain exactly 48 elements of order 7. This is only true if $n_7=8$. However, it is possible that $n_7=1$. For example, the direct product group $\\mathbb{Z}_7 \\times D_4$ has order 56 and $n_7=1$. In this group, there are only 6 elements of order 7. So, this statement is not always true.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that is necessarily true for any group of order 56 is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1641433"}, {"introduction": "What if Sylow's theorems alone don't force a unique Sylow subgroup?

This gives a relation between $|K|$ and $d$: $36 = d |K|$. Since $d$ must divide 24, we can write $24 = m d$ for some integer $m$. Substituting $d=24/m$ into the relation gives $36 = \\frac{24}{m}|K|$, which simplifies to $36m = 24|K|$, or $3m = 2|K|$.\nSince 2 and 3 are prime, this implies that $|K|$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nNext, we analyze the structure of the kernel. The kernel of the action is the set of elements in $G$ that fix every Sylow 3-subgroup under conjugation.

The stabilizer of $P$ under conjugation is its normalizer $N_G(P)$.\n$$n_3 = |G : N_G(P)| = \\frac{|G|}{|N_G(P)|}$$\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n$$4 = \\frac{36}{|N_G(P)|} \\implies |N_G(P)| = 9$$\nA Sylow 3-subgroup $P$ has order 9. A subgroup is always contained in its normalizer, so $P \\subseteq N_G(P)$. Since $|P|=|N_G(P)|=9$, we must have $P = N_G(P)$ for any $P \\in X$.\nTherefore, the kernel is the intersection of all the Sylow 3-subgroups themselves:\n$$K = \\bigcap_{P \\in X} P$$\nSince $K$ is a subgroup of any of the Sylow 3-subgroups (e.g., $P_1$), its order $|K|$ must divide $|P_1|=9$.
