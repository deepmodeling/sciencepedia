Hence it is a principal ideal domain and a unique factorization domain. For a rational prime $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, its factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is governed by congruences modulo $4$: if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $p$ splits into two nonassociate Gaussian primes, conjugate to each other; if $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $p$ remains prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$; and $2$ ramifies.\n\nSince $29 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, it must split. By the sum of two squares theorem, write\n$$\n29=5^{2}+2^{2},\n$$\nso in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ we have the element factorization\n$$\n29=(5+2i)(5-2i).\n$$\nTaking ideals, in a principal ideal domain we obtain\n$$\n(29)=(5+2i)(5-2i).\n$$\nThe elements $5+2i$ and $5-2i$ are irreducible because their norms equal $N(5\\pm 2i)=5^{2}+2^{2}=29$, a rational prime. Therefore the principal ideals $(5+2i)$ and $(5-2i)$ are prime ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nWe now determine the contractions to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $Q=(5+2i)$. If $m \\in Q \\cap \\mathbb{Z}$, then $(5+2i)$ divides $m$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Taking norms gives\n$$\nN(5+2i) \\mid N(m) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad 29 \\mid m^{2},\n$$\nand since $29$ is a rational prime, this implies $29 \\mid m$, hence $m \\in (29)$. Conversely, $29 \\in (5+2i)$ because\n$$\n29=(5+2i)(5-2i) \\in (5+2i),\n$$\nso $(29) \\subseteq Q \\cap \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore $Q \\cap \\mathbb{Z}=(29)$. The same argument applies to the conjugate prime ideal $(5-2i)$, yielding $(5-2i) \\cap \\mathbb{Z}=(29)$.\n\nThus the distinct prime ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ that lie over $(29)$ are exactly $(5+2i)$ and $(5-2i)$, corresponding to option C.
