This ring is an example of a ring of integers in a quadratic number field.\n\nFor any element $\\beta = a+b\\sqrt{-2}$ in this ring, its field norm, denoted $N(\\beta)$, is defined as the product of the element with its complex conjugate.\n\nAn ideal in this ring is a special subset.

The generator of the ideal is given as $\\alpha = 4 + \\sqrt{-2}$.\n\nAccording to the problem, the norm of a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$ is given by the formula $N((\\alpha)) = |N(\\alpha)|$, where $N(\\alpha)$ is the field norm of the element $\\alpha$.\n\nThe field norm of an element $\\beta = a+b\\sqrt{-2}$ is defined as the product of the element with its complex conjugate. The complex conjugate of $\\beta = a+b\\sqrt{-2}$ is $\\bar{\\beta} = a-b\\sqrt{-2}$.\n\nSo, the field norm is:\n$$N(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\bar{\\beta} = (a+b\\sqrt{-2})(a-b\\sqrt{-2})$$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$$N(\\beta) = a^2 - (b\\sqrt{-2})^2 = a^2 - b^2(-2) = a^2 + 2b^2$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to our specific element $\\alpha = 4 + \\sqrt{-2}$.

This practice [@problem_id:1786786] challenges you to compute the norm of a non-principal ideal by calculating the size of the corresponding quotient ring. This exercise illuminates why unique factorization can fail for elements in rings like $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-11}]$ and demonstrates how the ideal norm serves as a crucial tool for investigating the structure of ideals.", "problem": "Let $R$ be the ring of numbers of the form $a + b\\sqrt{-11}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. The norm of an element $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-11}$ is defined as $N(\\alpha) = a^2 + 11b^2$. If an ideal $I$ in this ring is principal and generated by an element $\\alpha$ (denoted $I = (\\alpha)$), then the norm of the ideal, $N(I)$, is equal to $N(\\alpha)$ (since $N(\\alpha)$ is always non-negative).\n\nIn the ring $R$, the principal ideal $(3)$ generated by the integer 3 is known to factor into a product of two distinct prime ideals, $(3) = P_1 P_2$. One of these ideals is given by the generators $P_1 = (3, 1+\\sqrt{-11})$.\n\nIf the ideal $P_1$ were a principal ideal, it would be generated by some element $\\gamma \\in R$. What value must the norm of this hypothetical generator, $N(\\gamma)$, have? Your answer should be a single positive integer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the value of the norm $N(\\gamma)$ under the assumption that the ideal $P_1 = (3, 1+\\sqrt{-11})$ is a principal ideal generated by an element $\\gamma \\in R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-11}]$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, if an ideal $I$ is principal, say $I=(\\alpha)$, its norm $N(I)$ is given by $N(\\alpha)$. Thus, if we were to assume $P_1 = (\\gamma)$, then it must be that $N(P_1) = N(\\gamma)$. Our task, therefore, reduces to calculating the norm of the ideal $P_1$.\n\nThe norm of an ideal $I$ in the ring of integers $R$ is defined as the number of elements in the quotient ring $R/I$. In this case, we need to determine the size of the quotient ring $R/P_1 = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-11}]/(3, 1+\\sqrt{-11})$.\n\nAn element in this quotient ring is a coset of the form $(a+b\\sqrt{-11}) + P_1$. The ideal $P_1$ is generated by the elements $3$ and $1+\\sqrt{-11}$. This means that within the quotient ring, any element in $P_1$ is equivalent to the zero element. Specifically, multiples of the generators are zero.\nSo, we have the following congruences modulo $P_1$:\n1. $3 \\equiv 0$\n2. $1+\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv 0$\n\nFrom the second relation, we deduce that $\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{P_1}$.\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary element $a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\in R$. We can analyze its corresponding class in the quotient ring by using the congruences. Substituting $\\sqrt{-11}$ with $-1$, we get:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv a+b(-1) = a-b \\pmod{P_1}$$\nThis shows that every element in $R$ is congruent to a simple integer modulo $P_1$.\n\nFurthermore, from the first relation, $3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$, any integer is congruent to its remainder modulo 3. Since $(3) \\subset P_1$, this congruence holds in the quotient ring $R/P_1$. For any integer $m$, there exists a unique $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that $m \\equiv k \\pmod 3$.\n\nCombining these two observations, we can simplify any element of the quotient ring:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv a-b \\pmod{P_1}$$\nLet $m = a-b$. Then $m$ is some integer, and $m \\equiv k \\pmod 3$ for some $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. This implies:\n$$a+b\\sqrt{-11} \\equiv k \\pmod{P_1}$$\nThis suggests that there are at most three distinct elements in the quotient ring $R/P_1$, represented by the integers $0, 1, 2$.\n\nTo confirm there are exactly three elements, we must ensure these representatives are distinct in the quotient ring. This is equivalent to showing that $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$ and $2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$ and $1 \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod{P_1}$. If $1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$, it means $1 \\in P_1$. An ideal containing $1$ must be the entire ring, $P_1 = R$. However, the problem states that $(3)$ factors into prime ideals $P_1 P_2$. Prime ideals are by definition proper ideals, so $P_1 \\neq R$. We can verify this directly. If $1 \\in (3, 1+\\sqrt{-11})$, then there exist integers $x,y,u,v$ such that:\n$$1 = 3(x+y\\sqrt{-11}) + (1+\\sqrt{-11})(u+v\\sqrt{-11})$$\nExpanding the right hand side:\n$$1 = (3x+3y\\sqrt{-11}) + (u+v\\sqrt{-11}+u\\sqrt{-11}-11v)$$\n$$1 = (3x+u-11v) + (3y+v+u)\\sqrt{-11}$$\nFor this equality to hold, the coefficient of the imaginary part must be zero, and the real part must be one:\n1. $1 = 3x+u-11v$\n2. $0 = 3y+u+v$\nFrom the second equation, $u = -3y-v$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:\n$$1 = 3x + (-3y-v) - 11v = 3x - 3y - 12v = 3(x-y-4v)$$\nThis equation implies that $1$ is an integer multiple of $3$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $1 \\notin P_1$, which means $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{P_1}$. It follows that the classes represented by $0, 1, 2$ are distinct.\n\nThus, the quotient ring $R/P_1$ has exactly three elements. By definition, the norm of the ideal $P_1$ is the size of this quotient ring.\n$$N(P_1) = |R/P_1| = 3$$\nIf the ideal $P_1$ were principal and generated by an element $\\gamma$, its norm would be equal to the norm of its generator:\n$$N(P_1) = N(\\gamma)$$\nTherefore, the norm of the hypothetical generator $\\gamma$ must be 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1786786"}, {"introduction": "Having explored ideal norms, we now turn to one of the central triumphs of the theory: a systematic method for factoring prime numbers into prime ideals.
