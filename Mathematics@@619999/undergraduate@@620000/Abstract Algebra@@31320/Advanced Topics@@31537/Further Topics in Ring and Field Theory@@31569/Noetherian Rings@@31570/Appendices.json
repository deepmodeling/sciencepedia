Consider the ideal $I$ generated by the two polynomials $p(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2$ and $q(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2$.

Therefore, we need to find the GCD of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. We can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials to find the GCD.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm for polynomials involves a sequence of polynomial divisions. Let's denote the two polynomials as $p(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2$ and $q(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2$.\nA property of ideals is that for any polynomial $r(x)$, the ideal $(p(x), q(x))$ is the same as the ideal $(p(x), q(x) - r(x)p(x))$. We can use this to simplify the generators. Let's subtract $p(x)$ from $q(x)$ to get a polynomial of a lower degree.\nLet $r_1(x) = q(x) - p(x)$:\n$$r_1(x) = (x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2) - (x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2) = 4x^2 - 4$$\nNow the ideal is $I = (p(x), r_1(x)) = (x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2, 4x^2 - 4)$.\nSince we are in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, the non-zero rational number $4$ is a unit.

Specifically, $x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2 = (x-2)(x^2-1)$.\n\nSince $p(x)$ is a multiple of $p_2(x)$, any element in the ideal $I = (p(x), p_2(x))$ can be written as:\n$$A(x)p(x) + B(x)p_2(x) = A(x)(x-2)p_2(x) + B(x)p_2(x) = [A(x)(x-2) + B(x)] p_2(x)$$\nThis shows that every element in the ideal is a multiple of $p_2(x) = x^2 - 1$.

A polynomial is monic if its leading coefficient is 1. The polynomial $g(x) = x^2 - 1$ has a leading coefficient of 1, so it is monic.\nAny other polynomial generator of $I$ must be of the form $c \\cdot g(x)$ where $c$ is a non-zero rational number (a unit in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$). For $c \\cdot g(x) = c(x^2 - 1) = cx^2 - c$ to be monic, its leading coefficient $c$ must be 1.
