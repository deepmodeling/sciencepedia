Let's test the proposed decomposition $I = (x) \\cap (x^3, y)$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that this equality of ideals holds. This requires showing containment in both directions.\n\n**Part 1: Show that $I \\subseteq (x) \\cap (x^3, y)$**\n\nWe need to show that each generator of $I$ is an element of the intersection.\n- For the generator $x^3$:\n  - $x^3 = x \\cdot x^2$, so $x^3 \\in (x)$.\n  - $x^3 = 1 \\cdot x^3 + 0 \\cdot y$, so $x^3 \\in (x^3, y)$.\n  - Since $x^3$ is in both ideals, $x^3 \\in (x) \\cap (x^3, y)$.\n- For the generator $xy$:\n  - $xy = y \\cdot x$, so $xy \\in (x)$.\n  - $xy = 0 \\cdot x^3 + x \\cdot y$, so $xy \\in (x^3, y)$.\n  - Since $xy$ is in both ideals, $xy \\in (x) \\cap (x^3, y)$.\n\nSince both generators of $I$ are in the intersection, the ideal $I = (x^3, xy)$ is a subset of $(x) \\cap (x^3, y)$.\n\n**Part 2: Show that $(x) \\cap (x^3, y) \\subseteq I$**\n\nLet $f$ be an arbitrary element of $(x) \\cap (x^3, y)$.\n- Since $f \\in (x)$, there exists a polynomial $g \\in k[x,y]$ such that $f = g \\cdot x$.\n- Since $f \\in (x^3, y)$, there exist polynomials $h, j \\in k[x,y]$ such that $f = h \\cdot x^3 + j \\cdot y$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $f$, we get:\n$g \\cdot x = h \\cdot x^3 + j \\cdot y$\nLet's evaluate this polynomial identity at $x=0$:\n$g(0,y) \\cdot 0 = h(0,y) \\cdot 0^3 + j(0,y) \\cdot y$\nThis simplifies to $0 = j(0,y) \\cdot y$. Since $k[y]$ is an integral domain, this equality implies $j(0,y) = 0$.\nThe condition $j(0,y)=0$ means that the polynomial $j(x,y)$, when viewed as a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in $k[y]$, has a root at $x=0$. By the Factor Theorem, this implies that $j(x,y)$ is divisible by $x$. So, there exists a polynomial $l \\in k[x,y]$ such that $j = l \\cdot x$.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $j$ back into the equation for $f$ from the ideal $(x^3,y)$:\n$f = h \\cdot x^3 + (l \\cdot x) \\cdot y = h \\cdot x^3 + l \\cdot xy$\nThis shows $f$ as a linear combination of $x^3$ and $xy$ with polynomial coefficients $h$ and $l$. By definition, this means $f \\in (x^3, xy) = I$.\nSince an arbitrary element $f$ of $(x) \\cap (x^3, y)$ is also in $I$, we have shown that $(x) \\cap (x^3, y) \\subseteq I$.\n\nCombining both parts, we have established the equality $I = (x) \\cap (x^3, y)$.\n\nNext, we must verify that this is a primary decomposition and that it is minimal.\n\n**Part 3: Verify that the components are primary ideals**\n\nLet $Q_1 = (x)$ and $Q_2 = (x^3, y)$.\n- The ideal $Q_1 = (x)$ is generated by the irreducible polynomial $x$.

The radical of an ideal $J$ is the ideal $\\sqrt{J} = \\{ f \\in R \\mid f^n \\in J \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$.\n  - $x^3 \\in Q_2 \\implies x \\in \\sqrt{Q_2}$.\n  - $y^1 \\in Q_2 \\implies y \\in \\sqrt{Q_2}$.\n  - Thus, the ideal $(x,y)$ is contained in $\\sqrt{Q_2}$.\n  - In $k[x,y]$, the ideal $(x,y)$ is maximal because the quotient ring $k[x,y]/(x,y) \\cong k$ is a field.\n  - Since $\\sqrt{Q_2}$ contains a maximal ideal $(x,y)$ and is not the entire ring (as $1 \\notin \\sqrt{Q_2}$), it must be that $\\sqrt{Q_2} = (x,y)$.\n  - An ideal whose radical is a maximal ideal is always a primary ideal. Since $\\sqrt{Q_2}=(x,y)$ is maximal, $Q_2=(x^3,y)$ is a primary ideal.\nSince both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are primary ideals, $I = Q_1 \\cap Q_2$ is a primary decomposition.\n\n**Part 4: Verify that the decomposition is minimal**\n\n- Condition 1: The radicals of the components must be distinct.\n  - $\\sqrt{Q_1} = \\sqrt{(x)} = (x)$ (since $(x)$ is a prime ideal).\n  - $\\sqrt{Q_2} = \\sqrt{(x^3,y)} = (x,y)$.\n  - The radicals $(x)$ and $(x,y)$ are distinct, so this condition is met.\n- Condition 2: No component is redundant. We must check that $Q_1 \\not\\subseteq Q_2$ and $Q_2 \\not\\subseteq Q_1$.\n  - To check if $Q_1 \\subseteq Q_2$: Is $(x) \\subseteq (x^3,y)$? No, because the element $x \\in (x)$, but $x \\not\\in (x^3,y)$. If $x = f \\cdot x^3 + g \\cdot y$, setting $y=0$ yields $x = f(x,0)x^3$, implying $1=f(x,0)x^2$, which is impossible for polynomials. So $Q_1 \\not\\subseteq Q_2$.\n  - To check if $Q_2 \\subseteq Q_1$: Is $(x^3,y) \\subseteq (x)$? No, because the element $y \\in (x^3,y)$, but $y \\not\\in (x)$.\n  - Both non-containment conditions are met.\n\nSince the decomposition satisfies all conditions for minimality, $I = (x) \\cap (x^3,y)$ is a minimal primary decomposition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(x) \\cap (x^3, y)}$$", "id": "1813940"}]}
