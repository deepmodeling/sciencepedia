A natural first question is what this structure implies for fundamental algebraic properties.

Let us consider such a ring $R$ with the following structure:\n$$R \\cong M_{n_1}(D_1) \\times M_{n_2}(D_2) \\times \\dots \\times M_{n_k}(D_k)$$\nHere, for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, $M_{n_i}(D_i)$ denotes the ring of $n_i \\times n_i$ matrices with entries from a division ring $D_i$, where each $n_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nWhich of the following choices presents the necessary and sufficient conditions on the integers $n_i$ and the division rings $D_i$ for the ring $R$ to be commutative?\n\nA.

Indeed, if $R \\cong \\prod_{i=1}^{k} R_{i}$ with coordinatewise operations, then for any $(r_{i})_{i}$ and $(s_{i})_{i}$ in $R$, we have\n$$(r_{i})_{i}(s_{i})_{i}=(r_{i}s_{i})_{i},\\quad (s_{i})_{i}(r_{i})_{i}=(s_{i}r_{i})_{i}.$$\nThus $(r_{i})_{i}(s_{i})_{i}=(s_{i})_{i}(r_{i})_{i}$ for all elements if and only if $r_{i}s_{i}=s_{i}r_{i}$ for all $i$ and all $r_{i},s_{i}\\in R_{i}$. Hence $R$ is commutative if and only if each $R_{i}$ is commutative.\n\nSecond, for a division ring $D$ and integer $n\\geq 1$, the matrix ring $M_{n}(D)$ is commutative if and only if $n=1$ and $D$ is commutative. The necessity of $n=1$ follows because for $n\\geq 2$, the standard matrix units $E_{12}$ and $E_{21}$ satisfy\n$$E_{12}E_{21}=E_{11},\\quad E_{21}E_{12}=E_{22},$$\nand $E_{11}\\neq E_{22}$, so $M_{n}(D)$ is noncommutative for $n\\geq 2$ regardless of $D$. When $n=1$, $M_{1}(D)\\cong D$, which is commutative exactly when $D$ is commutative; since $D$ is a division ring, commutativity is equivalent to $D$ being a field.\n\nCombining these, $R\\cong \\prod_{i=1}^{k} M_{n_{i}}(D_{i})$ is commutative if and only if each factor $M_{n_{i}}(D_{i})$ is commutative, which holds if and only if for all $i$ we have $n_{i}=1$ and $D_{i}$ is a field.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A requires for all $i$ that $n_{i}=1$ and $D_{i}$ is a field; this is exactly the necessary and sufficient condition.\n- B omits that $D_{i}$ must be commutative; $M_{1}(D_{i})\\cong D_{i}$ could be a noncommutative division ring.\n- C omits that $n_{i}$ must be $1$; $M_{n}(\\text{field})$ is noncommutative for $n\\geq 2$.\n- D is sufficient but not necessary since products of multiple fields are commutative.\n- E is false because products of fields are commutative and nonzero.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1826060"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of the theory of semisimple rings is the elegant classification of their modules. The Artin-Wedderburn decomposition directly reveals the structure of a ring's 'atomic' representationsâ€”its simple modules.

Thus there is a unique $i$ with $e_{i}M=M$ and $e_{j}M=0$ for $j\\neq i$. In this case the action of $R$ on $M$ factors through the projection $R\\to R_{i}$, and $M$ is a simple left $R_{i}$-module.

By standard structure theory of $M_{n}(D)$, every simple left module is isomorphic to this one.\n\n2) For $R_{2}=M_{2}(\\mathbb{H})$, the same argument applies: there is exactly one isomorphism class of simple left modules, represented by $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ with the natural left action by matrices. Again, $M_{2}(\\mathbb{H})$ is simple Artinian, and all simple left modules are isomorphic.\n\n3) For $R_{3}=\\mathbb{R}$, a field, there is exactly one isomorphism class of simple left modules, namely $\\mathbb{R}$ itself as a $1$-dimensional vector space.\n\nSumming these counts gives\n$$\n1+1+1=3.\n$$\nTherefore, there are exactly three non-isomorphic simple left $R$-modules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1826088"}, {"introduction": "We now move from analyzing a given structure to synthesizing possibilities from first principles.
