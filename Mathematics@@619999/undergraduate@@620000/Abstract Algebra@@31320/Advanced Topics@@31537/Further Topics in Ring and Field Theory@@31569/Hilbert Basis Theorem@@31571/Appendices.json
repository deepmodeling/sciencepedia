The polynomial ring $k[x,y]$ in two variables is a cornerstone of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. A celebrated result, Hilbert's Basis Theorem, implies that $k[x,y]$ is a Noetherian ring, meaning every ideal within it is finitely generated. This problem investigates whether this property is inherited by all subrings.\n\nConsider the subset $S$ of $k[x,y]$ defined as:\n$$S = \\{ f(x,y) \\in k[x,y] \\mid \\text{the polynomial } g(y) = f(0,y) \\text{ is a constant, i.e., } g(y) \\in k \\}$$\nIt can be verified that $S$ is a subring of $k[x,y]$ containing the field $k$.\n\nNow, let $J$ be the ideal of the ring $S$ generated by the infinite set of polynomials $\\{xy^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 \\}$, where $\\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.

Here is a detailed step-by-step derivation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the ring $S$ and the ideal $J$.\n\nA polynomial $f(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$ belongs to the subring $S$ if and only if setting $x=0$ results in a constant polynomial. Any polynomial $f(x,y)$ can be written as $f(x,y) = f(0,y) + x \\cdot h(x,y)$ for some polynomial $h(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$. The condition for $f$ to be in $S$ is that $f(0,y)$ must be a constant, let's call it $c \\in k$. Therefore, any element of $S$ can be uniquely expressed in the form $c + x \\cdot h(x,y)$ for some $c \\in k$ and $h(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$.\n\nNow, let's characterize the ideal $J = \\langle x, xy, xy^2, \\dots \\rangle_S$. By definition, any element $p \\in J$ is a finite sum of the form $p = \\sum_{i=0}^N s_i \\cdot (xy^i)$, where $s_i \\in S$ and $N$ is some non-negative integer.\nSince each $s_i \\in S$, we can write $s_i = c_i + x \\cdot h_i(x,y)$ for some $c_i \\in k$ and $h_i(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p$:\n$$p = \\sum_{i=0}^N (c_i + x h_i(x,y)) (xy^i) = \\sum_{i=0}^N c_i xy^i + \\sum_{i=0}^N x^2 h_i(x,y) y^i$$\nWe can factor out an $x$ from the entire expression:\n$$p = x \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^N c_i y^i + x \\sum_{i=0}^N h_i(x,y) y^i \\right)$$\nThe term inside the parentheses is a polynomial in $k[x,y]$. This shows that any element of $J$ is a multiple of $x$.\n\nConversely, let's consider an arbitrary element of the form $x \\cdot q(x,y)$ where $q(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$. We want to know if this element belongs to $J$.\nWe can write $q(x,y)$ by separating terms that don't depend on $x$: $q(x,y) = q_0(y) + x \\cdot q_1(x,y)$, where $q_0(y) \\in k[y]$ and $q_1(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$.\nThen $x \\cdot q(x,y) = x \\cdot q_0(y) + x^2 \\cdot q_1(x,y)$.\nThe polynomial $q_0(y)$ can be written as a finite sum $q_0(y) = \\sum_{i=0}^M a_i y^i$ for some coefficients $a_i \\in k$.\nSo, $x \\cdot q_0(y) = \\sum_{i=0}^M a_i (xy^i)$. Each $a_i$ is a constant, so $a_i \\in S$. This term is a finite linear combination of the generators of $J$ with coefficients in $S$, so it is in $J$.\nFor the second term, $x^2 \\cdot q_1(x,y) = (x \\cdot q_1(x,y)) \\cdot x$. The first factor, $s = x \\cdot q_1(x,y)$, is an element of $S$ because $s(0,y) = 0 \\cdot q_1(0,y) = 0$, which is a constant in $k$. The second factor, $x = xy^0$, is a generator of $J$. Thus, $x^2 q_1(x,y)$ is in $J$.\nSince both terms are in $J$, their sum $x \\cdot q(x,y)$ is in $J$.\nThis proves that the ideal $J$ is precisely the set of all polynomials in $k[x,y]$ that are divisible by $x$. That is, $J = x k[x,y]$.\n\nThe main task is to determine if $J$ is finitely generated as an ideal of $S$. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $J$ is finitely generated. This means there exists a finite set of generators $\\{g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_m\\} \\subset J$ such that $J = \\langle g_1, \\dots, g_m \\rangle_S$.\nSince each $g_j \\in J$, we can write $g_j(x,y) = x \\cdot h_j(x,y)$ for some polynomials $h_j(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$.\nLet $p(x,y)$ be any element of $J$. By our assumption, it can be written as a linear combination of the generators:\n$p(x,y) = \\sum_{j=1}^m s_j \\cdot g_j(x,y)$ for some coefficients $s_j \\in S$.\nWriting each $s_j$ as $s_j = c_j + x \\cdot r_j(x,y)$ with $c_j \\in k$ and $r_j \\in k[x,y]$, we get:\n$p(x,y) = \\sum_{j=1}^m (c_j + x r_j(x,y)) \\cdot (x h_j(x,y)) = x \\sum_{j=1}^m (c_j h_j(x,y) + x r_j(x,y) h_j(x,y))$.\nSince $p(x,y) \\in J = xk[x,y]$, we can write $p(x,y) = x \\cdot q(x,y)$ for some $q(x,y) \\in k[x,y]$. Comparing the two expressions for $p(x,y)$ gives:\n$q(x,y) = \\sum_{j=1}^m (c_j h_j(x,y) + x r_j(x,y) h_j(x,y))$.\n\nThis identity must hold for any choice of $p \\in J$ by choosing appropriate $s_j \\in S$.\nLet $d$ be the maximum degree in the variable $y$ among all the polynomials $h_j(0,y)$ for $j=1, \\dots, m$. Formally, $d = \\max_{j=1,\\dots,m} \\{ \\deg_y(h_j(0,y)) \\}$.\nNow, consider the specific element $p(x,y) = xy^{d+1}$, which is in $J$ since $d+1 \\ge 0$. For this $p$, the corresponding $q(x,y)$ is $y^{d+1}$.\nAccording to our assumption, there must exist coefficients $s_j = c_j + x r_j \\in S$ such that:\n$y^{d+1} = \\sum_{j=1}^m (c_j + x r_j(x,y)) h_j(x,y)$.\nThis is a polynomial identity in $k[x,y]$. We can evaluate both sides at $x=0$:\n$y^{d+1} = \\sum_{j=1}^m (c_j + 0 \\cdot r_j(0,y)) h_j(0,y) = \\sum_{j=1}^m c_j h_j(0,y)$.\nThe left side of the equation is a polynomial in $y$ of degree $d+1$. The right side is a $k$-linear combination of the polynomials $h_j(0,y)$. The degree of the right side is at most the maximum of the degrees of the $h_j(0,y)$, which is $d$.\nSo we have reached the statement that a polynomial of degree $d+1$ is equal to a polynomial of degree at most $d$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, our initial assumption that $J$ can be finitely generated must be false.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA. $J$ is a principal ideal. A principal ideal is generated by a single element, so it is finitely generated. This contradicts our finding. Thus, A is false.\nB. $J$ is finitely generated but not principal. This contradicts our finding. Thus, B is false.\nC. $J$ is not finitely generated. This is precisely what we have proven. Thus, C is true.\nD. $J$ is the zero ideal. This is false, as for example $x = xy^0$ is a generator and is non-zero.\nE. $J$ is the entire ring, $J = S$. This would imply $1 \\in J$. If $1 \\in J = x k[x,y]$, then $1 = x \\cdot q(x,y)$ for some $q \\in k[x,y]$. Setting $x=0$ in this identity gives $1=0$, a contradiction. Thus, E is false.\n\nThe only correct statement is C.
