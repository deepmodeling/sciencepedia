The relations matrix $A$ is constructed by writing the coefficients of the relations as rows. The number of columns equals the number of generators ($n=3$), and the number of rows equals the number of relations ($m=2$).\nThe relations are:\n1. $2x + 4y + 0z = 0$\n2. $0x + 0y + 3z = 0$\n\nThe corresponding relations matrix is:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe will find the SNF of $A$ by applying a sequence of elementary integer row and column operations (swapping rows/columns, multiplying a row/column by -1, and adding an integer multiple of one row/column to another).
