First, $p(A)=0$ because $p(T)$ is the zero operator on $V$. For any element $[f(x)] \\in V$, we have $p(T)([f(x)]) = [p(x)f(x)]$. Since $[p(x)] = [0]$ in $V = \\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(p(x))$, this means $[p(x)f(x)]=[0]$, so $p(T)$ is the zero operator. Thus the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $p(x)$.\n\nNext, no nonzero polynomial of degree less than 4 can annihilate $A$. Suppose a polynomial $q(x)$ with degree less than 4 satisfies $q(A)=0$. This implies that the operator $q(T)$ is the zero operator on $V$. However, applying $q(T)$ to the vector $[1] \\in V$ yields $[q(x)]$. For this result to be the zero vector, $q(x)$ must be a multiple of $p(x)$. Since $\\deg(q(x))  \\deg(p(x))$, this is only possible if $q(x)$ is the zero polynomial. This shows that no non-zero polynomial of degree less than 4 annihilates $A$. Hence the minimal polynomial has degree at least 4. Since it divides $p(x)$ (which has degree 4) and both are monic, the minimal polynomial must equal $p(x)$.\n\nThus the explicit matrix $A$ above has minimal polynomial $x^{4}+x+1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  0  1\\\\\n1  0  0  1\\\\\n0  1  0  0\\\\\n0  0  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1776871"}]}
