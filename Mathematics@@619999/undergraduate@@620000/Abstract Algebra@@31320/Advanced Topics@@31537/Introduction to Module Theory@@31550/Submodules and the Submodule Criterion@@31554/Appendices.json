Usually, this is checked by showing the zero element of $M$ is in $S$.\n2. $S$ must be closed under addition: for any $s_1, s_2 \\in S$, their sum $s_1 + s_2$ must also be in $S$.\n3. $S$ must be closed under scalar multiplication: for any $r \\in R$ and $s \\in S$, the product $r \\cdot s$ must also be in $S$.\n\nIn this problem, the ring is $R = \\mathbb{Z}$ and the module is $M = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. The zero element of $M$ is $(0,0)$. We analyze each subset.\n\n**I. Analysis of $S_1 = \\{(x, y) \\in M \\mid x+y \\text{ is an even number}\\}$**\n1.  **Non-empty**: The element $(0,0) \\in M$ satisfies the condition because $0+0=0$, which is an even number. So, $(0,0) \\in S_1$ and $S_1$ is non-empty.\n2.  **Closure under addition**: Let $s_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $s_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be two arbitrary elements in $S_1$. By definition, $x_1+y_1$ is even and $x_2+y_2$ is even. This means $x_1+y_1 = 2k_1$ and $x_2+y_2 = 2k_2$ for some integers $k_1, k_2$. Their sum is $s_1+s_2 = (x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)$. To check if this is in $S_1$, we sum its components: $(x_1+x_2) + (y_1+y_2) = (x_1+y_1) + (x_2+y_2) = 2k_1 + 2k_2 = 2(k_1+k_2)$. Since $k_1+k_2$ is an integer, the sum of the components of $s_1+s_2$ is even. Thus, $s_1+s_2 \\in S_1$.\n3.  **Closure under scalar multiplication**: Let $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $s = (x, y) \\in S_1$. By definition, $x+y$ is even, so $x+y = 2k$ for some integer $k$. The scalar product is $r \\cdot s = (rx, ry)$. The sum of its components is $rx+ry = r(x+y) = r(2k) = 2(rk)$. Since $rk$ is an integer, this sum is even. Thus, $r \\cdot s \\in S_1$.\nSince all three conditions are met, $S_1$ is a submodule of $M$.\n\n**II. Analysis of $S_2 = \\{(x, y) \\in M \\mid x^2 = y^2\\}$**\n1.  **Non-empty**: $(0,0) \\in S_2$ because $0^2=0^2$.\n2.  **Closure under addition**: Let's test with a counterexample. The condition $x^2=y^2$ is equivalent to $|x|=|y|$ or $x = \\pm y$. Consider the elements $s_1 = (2, 2)$ and $s_2 = (2, -2)$. Both are in $S_2$ because $2^2 = 2^2$ and $2^2 = (-2)^2$. Their sum is $s_1+s_2 = (2+2, 2+(-2)) = (4, 0)$. For this sum to be in $S_2$, we must have $4^2 = 0^2$, which means $16 = 0$. This is false. Therefore, $S_2$ is not closed under addition.\nWe do not need to check the third condition. $S_2$ is not a submodule of $M$.\n\n**III. Analysis of $S_3 = \\{(x, y) \\in M \\mid 3x - 7y = 0\\}$**\n1.  **Non-empty**: For $(0,0)$, we have $3(0) - 7(0) = 0$. So, $(0,0) \\in S_3$.\n2.  **Closure under addition**: Let $s_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $s_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be in $S_3$. This means $3x_1 - 7y_1 = 0$ and $3x_2 - 7y_2 = 0$. Their sum is $s_1+s_2 = (x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)$. Let's check the condition for this sum: $3(x_1+x_2) - 7(y_1+y_2) = (3x_1 - 7y_1) + (3x_2 - 7y_2) = 0 + 0 = 0$. So, $s_1+s_2 \\in S_3$.\n3.  **Closure under scalar multiplication**: Let $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $s = (x, y) \\in S_3$. We know $3x - 7y = 0$. The scalar product is $r \\cdot s = (rx, ry)$. Let's check the condition: $3(rx) - 7(ry) = r(3x - 7y) = r(0) = 0$. So, $r \\cdot s \\in S_3$.\nSince all three conditions are met, $S_3$ is a submodule of $M$.\n\n**IV. Analysis of $S_4 = \\{(x, y) \\in M \\mid xy \\text{ is a multiple of 3}\\}$**\n1.  **Non-empty**: For $(0,0)$, the product is $0 \\cdot 0 = 0$, which is a multiple of 3. So, $(0,0) \\in S_4$.\n2.  **Closure under addition**: Let's test with a counterexample. Consider $s_1 = (3, 1)$ and $s_2 = (1, 3)$. For $s_1$, the product is $3 \\cdot 1 = 3$, so $s_1 \\in S_4$. For $s_2$, the product is $1 \\cdot 3 = 3$, so $s_2 \\in S_4$. Their sum is $s_1+s_2 = (3+1, 1+3) = (4, 4)$. For this sum, the product of components is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$. Since 16 is not a multiple of 3, the sum $(4,4)$ is not in $S_4$. Therefore, $S_4$ is not closed under addition.\n$S_4$ is not a submodule of $M$.\n\n**V. Analysis of $S_5 = \\{(x, y) \\in M \\mid x \\geq y\\}$**\n1.  **Non-empty**: For $(0,0)$, we have $0 \\geq 0$, which is true. So, $(0,0) \\in S_5$.\n2.  **Closure under scalar multiplication**: Let's test this condition first. Consider the element $s = (2, 1) \\in S_5$ since $2 \\geq 1$. Let the scalar be $r = -1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The scalar product is $r \\cdot s = (-1)(2, 1) = (-2, -1)$. For this to be in $S_5$, we must have $-2 \\geq -1$, which is false. Therefore, $S_5$ is not closed under scalar multiplication.\n$S_5$ is not a submodule of $M$.\n\nIn summary, only subsets I ($S_1$) and III ($S_3$) are submodules.
