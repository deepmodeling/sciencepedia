This imposes strong constraints on its decomposition:\n1.  If the free rank $r > 1$, the module is not cyclic.\n2.  If $r=1$, the module is $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus (\\text{torsion part})$. For this to be cyclic (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$), the torsion part must be trivial.\n3.  If $r=0$, the module is purely torsion, $M \\cong \\bigoplus_{i=1}^s \\mathbb{Z}/d_i\\mathbb{Z}$. This is cyclic if and only if it is isomorphic to a single cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. By the property of invariant factors where $d_1 | d_2 | \\dots | d_s$, this requires that there is at most one non-unit invariant factor. This is equivalent to $d_1 = \\dots = d_{s-1} = 1$.\n\nThe rank of the free part, $r$, is given by $r = (\\text{number of generators}) - (\\text{rank of matrix } A) = 2 - \\text{rank}(A)$. The invariant factors $d_i$ are calculated from the determinants of the $j \\times j$ minors of $A$. Let $\\Delta_j$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all $j \\times j$ minor determinants of $A$. The invariant factors are $d_j = \\Delta_j / \\Delta_{j-1}$ (with $\\Delta_0 = 1$).\n\nLet's compute the $\\Delta_j$ for our matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 6 \\\\ 4 & k \\end{pmatrix}$:\nThe $1 \\times 1$ minors are the entries of the matrix: $2, 6, 4, k$.\n$\\Delta_1 = \\gcd(2, 6, 4, k) = \\gcd(\\gcd(2, 6, 4), k) = \\gcd(2, k)$.\n\nThe only $2 \\times 2$ minor is the determinant of $A$:\n$\\det(A) = 2k - (6)(4) = 2k - 24$.\n$\\Delta_2 = |2k - 24|$.\n\nNow we analyze two cases based on the rank of $A$.\nCase 1: $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, i.e., $2k - 24 \\neq 0 \\implies k \\neq 12$.\nIn this case, $\\text{rank}(A) = 2$.\nThe free rank of the module is $r = 2 - 2 = 0$.\nThe module is purely torsion: $M \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/d_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe invariant factors are:\n$d_1 = \\Delta_1 / \\Delta_0 = \\Delta_1 = \\gcd(2, k)$.\n$d_2 = \\Delta_2 / \\Delta_1 = \\frac{|2k - 24|}{\\gcd(2, k)}$.\nFor $M$ to be cyclic, we need at most one non-unit invariant factor, which means we need $d_1=1$.\nSo, we need $\\gcd(2, k) = 1$. This condition is satisfied if and only if $k$ is an odd integer.\n\nCase 2: $\\det(A) = 0$, i.e., $k = 12$.\nIn this case, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 6 \\\\ 4 & 12 \\end{pmatrix}$. The second row is twice the first, so $\\text{rank}(A) = 1$.\nThe free rank of the module is $r = 2 - 1 = 1$.\nSince the rank is 1, the SNF will have only one non-zero entry. There is one invariant factor for the torsion part.\n$\\Delta_1 = \\gcd(2, 6, 4, 12) = 2$. So the single torsion invariant factor is $d_1 = \\Delta_1 = 2$.\nThe module decomposition is $M \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^1 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/d_1\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nA direct sum of a non-trivial free module and a non-trivial torsion module is not cyclic. To see this, any element $(a, \\bar{b})$ in $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has the property that $2(a, \\bar{b}) = (2a, \\bar{0})$. No single element can generate elements of the form $(c, \\bar{1})$ where $c$ is odd. For instance, $(1, \\bar{1})$ cannot be generated.\nSo, for $k=12$, the module is not cyclic.\nAlternatively, for the module to be cyclic in this case, its torsion part must be trivial, which means $d_1=1$. However, for $k=12$, $d_1=2$.\n\nCombining both cases:\n- If $k$ is odd, then $k \\neq 12$. We are in Case 1. The condition for cyclicity is $\\gcd(2,k)=1$, which is true for all odd $k$. Thus, for any odd integer $k$, the module is cyclic.\n- If $k$ is even, we can either have $k=12$ or $k \\neq 12$.\n    - If $k=12$, we are in Case 2, and the module is not cyclic.\n    - If $k$ is even and $k \\neq 12$, we are in Case 1. The condition for cyclicity is $d_1 = \\gcd(2,k)=1$. But if $k$ is even, $\\gcd(2,k)=2$. So the module is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, the module $M$ is cyclic if and only if $k$ is an odd integer.\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1840364"}]}
