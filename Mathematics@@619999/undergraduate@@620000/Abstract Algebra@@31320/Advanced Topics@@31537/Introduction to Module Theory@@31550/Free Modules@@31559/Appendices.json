All vectors in the set must belong to the submodule $M$.\n2.  The set must be linearly independent over the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  The set must span the submodule $M$. That is, every element in $M$ must be expressible as a linear combination of the vectors in the set with integer coefficients.\n\nThe submodule $M$ consists of all vectors $(a,b,c) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$ such that $a+b+c=0$. This implies that for any vector in $M$, one component can be expressed in terms of the other two, for instance, $c = -a-b$.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. $S_1 = \\{(1, 0, -1), (0, 1, -1)\\}$**\n1.  **Membership in M**: For the vector $(1, 0, -1)$, the sum of components is $1 + 0 + (-1) = 0$. For $(0, 1, -1)$, the sum is $0 + 1 + (-1) = 0$. Both vectors are in $M$.\n2.  **Linear Independence**: We check if there are non-zero integers $k_1, k_2$ such that $k_1(1, 0, -1) + k_2(0, 1, -1) = (0, 0, 0)$. This equation expands to $(k_1, k_2, -k_1 - k_2) = (0, 0, 0)$. Comparing the first two components gives $k_1 = 0$ and $k_2 = 0$. Thus, the set is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **Spanning M**: Let $(a, b, c)$ be an arbitrary vector in $M$. By definition, $a+b+c=0$, so $c=-a-b$. We want to find integers $k_1, k_2$ such that $(a, b, c) = k_1(1, 0, -1) + k_2(0, 1, -1)$. This leads to the vector equation $(a, b, -a-b) = (k_1, k_2, -k_1-k_2)$. Comparing components, we get $k_1=a$ and $k_2=b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers for any vector in $M$, we can always find such integer coefficients. The third component is automatically satisfied: $-k_1-k_2 = -a-b = c$. Therefore, $S_1$ spans $M$.\nSince all three conditions are met, $S_1$ is a basis for $M$.\n\n**B. $S_2 = \\{(1, -1, 0), (-1, 0, 1)\\}$**\n1.  **Membership in M**: For $(1, -1, 0)$, the sum is $1 + (-1) + 0 = 0$. For $(-1, 0, 1)$, the sum is $-1 + 0 + 1 = 0$. Both vectors are in $M$.\n2.  **Linear Independence**: We check $k_1(1, -1, 0) + k_2(-1, 0, 1) = (0, 0, 0)$. This expands to $(k_1 - k_2, -k_1, k_2) = (0, 0, 0)$. The second and third components directly give $-k_1=0 \\implies k_1=0$ and $k_2=0$. The set is linearly independent.\n3.  **Spanning M**: Let $(a, b, c) \\in M$, with $a+b+c=0$. We seek integers $k_1, k_2$ such that $(a, b, c) = k_1(1, -1, 0) + k_2(-1, 0, 1) = (k_1-k_2, -k_1, k_2)$. Comparing the second and third components, we find $k_1=-b$ and $k_2=c$. Since $b,c$ are integers, $k_1,k_2$ are integers. We check if the first component is consistent: $a = k_1-k_2 = (-b) - c = -b-c$. From the condition $a+b+c=0$, we have $a=-b-c$, so this is consistent. Therefore, $S_2$ spans $M$.\nSince all three conditions are met, $S_2$ is a basis for $M$.\n\n**C. $S_3 = \\{(1, -1, 0), (0, 1, -1), (1, 0, -1)\\}$**\n1.  **Membership in M**: For $(1, -1, 0)$, sum is $0$. For $(0, 1, -1)$, sum is $0$. For $(1, 0, -1)$, sum is $0$. All vectors are in $M$.\n2.  **Linear Independence**: We check for dependencies between the vectors. Notice that $(1, -1, 0) + (0, 1, -1) = (1+0, -1+1, 0-1) = (1, 0, -1)$. This means the third vector is a linear combination of the first two. A specific non-trivial linear combination that gives the zero vector is $1 \\cdot (1, -1, 0) + 1 \\cdot (0, 1, -1) - 1 \\cdot (1, 0, -1) = (0,0,0)$. Since the set is linearly dependent, it cannot be a basis.\n\n**D. $S_4 = \\{(1, 1, -2), (1, -1, 0)\\}$**\n1.  **Membership in M**: For $(1, 1, -2)$, the sum is $1+1+(-2)=0$. For $(1, -1, 0)$, the sum is $1+(-1)+0=0$. Both vectors are in $M$.\n2.  **Linear Independence**: We check $k_1(1, 1, -2) + k_2(1, -1, 0) = (0, 0, 0)$. This expands to $(k_1+k_2, k_1-k_2, -2k_1) = (0,0,0)$. The third component gives $-2k_1=0 \\implies k_1=0$. Substituting into the first component gives $0+k_2=0 \\implies k_2=0$. The set is linearly independent.\n3.  **Spanning M**: Let's try to express a general vector $(a,b,c) \\in M$ as a linear combination of the vectors in $S_4$: $(a, b, c) = k_1(1, 1, -2) + k_2(1, -1, 0) = (k_1+k_2, k_1-k_2, -2k_1)$. From the third component, we must have $c = -2k_1$. For $k_1$ to be an integer, $c$ must be an even integer. This means that vectors in $M$ where the third component is odd cannot be generated by this set. For example, the vector $(0, 1, -1)$ is in $M$, but it has an odd third component. Thus, $S_4$ does not span $M$. Since it does not span $M$, it is not a basis.\n\nBased on the analysis, only sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are bases for $M$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1797070"}]}
