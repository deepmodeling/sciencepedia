This problem asks you to investigate a specific instance of this property.\n\nLet $R = \\mathbb{Z}$ be the ring of integers.

For a simple tensor $2k \\otimes m \\in 2\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$ (where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, m \\in M$), its image under $\\Phi$ is $\\Phi(2k \\otimes m) = \\iota(2k) \\otimes m = 2k \\otimes m$, where the result is now an element of the codomain $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the domain and codomain using tensor product isomorphisms.\nThe codomain $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$ is canonically isomorphic to $M$ via the homomorphism $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M \\to M$ defined by $f(n \\otimes m) = nm$. This is a standard result for tensor products over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's analyze the domain $2\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$. A general element in this tensor product is a finite sum of the form $\\sum_i (2k_i) \\otimes m_i$, where $k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $m_i \\in M$.\nUsing the properties of the tensor product, we can simplify this expression:\n$$ \\sum_i (2k_i) \\otimes m_i = \\sum_i (2 \\cdot k_i) \\otimes m_i = \\sum_i 2 \\otimes (k_i m_i) = 2 \\otimes \\left(\\sum_i k_i m_i\\right) $$\nLet $y = \\sum_i k_i m_i$. Since $M$ is a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, $y$ is an element of $M$. Therefore, any element in $2\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$ can be written in the form $2 \\otimes y$ for some $y \\in M$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the kernel of $\\Phi$.\nAn element $z \\in 2\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$ is in the kernel of $\\Phi$ if $\\Phi(z)=0$ in $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$.\nLet $z = 2 \\otimes y$ for some $y \\in M$.\nThe image of $z$ is $\\Phi(2 \\otimes y) = 2 \\otimes y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$.\nFor this image to be the zero element in $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M$, it must map to $0$ under the isomorphism $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M \\to M$.\nApplying $f$ to the image:\n$$ f(\\Phi(z)) = f(2 \\otimes y) = 2y $$\nSo, $z = 2 \\otimes y$ is in the kernel of $\\Phi$ if and only if $2y = 0$ in $M$.\n\nStep 4: Use the specific properties of the module $M$.\nThe module $M$ is the set of rational numbers with odd denominators. Let $y \\in M$. Then $y$ can be written as $y = \\frac{a}{b}$ for some integers $a, b$ where $b$ is odd.\nThe condition $2y = 0$ becomes:\n$$ 2 \\cdot \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2a}{b} = 0 $$\nAs an equation in the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, this implies that the numerator must be zero, so $2a=0$. Since $a$ is an integer, this means $a=0$.\nIf $a=0$, then $y = \\frac{0}{b} = 0$.\nSo, the condition $2y=0$ in $M$ implies that $y=0$.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the structure of the kernel.\nWe found that an element $z = 2 \\otimes y$ is in $\\ker(\\Phi)$ if and only if $y=0$.\nIf $y=0$, then $z = 2 \\otimes 0 = 0$.\nThus, the only element in the kernel of $\\Phi$ is the zero element.\nThe kernel is the zero submodule, $\\ker(\\Phi)=\\{0\\}$.

The map is surjective because every element of $I_{n}$ is of the form $nk$ for some $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$.
