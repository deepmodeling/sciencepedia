The map $\\phi$ must be well-defined.\n2. The map $\\phi$ must preserve the group operation (the homomorphism property).\n\nLet's analyze each condition separately.\n\n**1. Well-definedness**\n\nA map is well-defined if its output does not depend on the choice of representative for the input equivalence class. In our case, if we have two representatives for the same class, say $[a]_m = [b]_m$, we must show that their images under $\\phi$ are also equal, i.e., $\\phi([a]_m) = \\phi([b]_m)$.\n\nThe condition $[a]_m = [b]_m$ means that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$. By the definition of congruence, this is equivalent to $a - b = qm$ for some integer $q$.\n\nThe images of these elements are $\\phi([a]_m) = [ka]_n$ and $\\phi([b]_m) = [kb]_n$.\nFor these images to be equal, we must have $[ka]_n = [kb]_n$, which means $ka \\equiv kb \\pmod{n}$.\nThis is equivalent to $ka - kb = rn$ for some integer $r$, which simplifies to $k(a - b) = rn$.\n\nNow, we substitute $a - b = qm$ into this requirement:\n$k(qm) = rn$\n$q(km) = rn$\n\nThis equation must hold for any pair of representatives $a, b$ such that $[a]_m = [b]_m$.\nA simple way to find the necessary condition is to consider a non-trivial case. Let's choose the representatives $0$ and $m$ for the zero class in $\\mathbb{Z}_m$. We have $[m]_m = [0]_m$.\nFor $\\phi$ to be well-defined, we must have $\\phi([m]_m) = \\phi([0]_m)$.\n\nLet's compute the images:\n$\\phi([0]_m) = [k \\cdot 0]_n = [0]_n$.\n$\\phi([m]_m) = [km]_n$.\n\nTherefore, the well-definedness condition requires $[km]_n = [0]_n$.\nThis means that $km$ must be a multiple of $n$. In terms of divisibility, this is written as $n | km$.\n\nNow we check if this condition is sufficient. Assume $n | km$. This means $km = sn$ for some integer $s$.\nLet $[a]_m = [b]_m$, so $a - b = qm$ for some integer $q$.\nWe want to show that $\\phi([a]_m) = \\phi([b]_m)$, which is equivalent to showing $ka \\equiv kb \\pmod n$, or $n | k(a-b)$.\n$k(a-b) = k(qm) = q(km)$.\nSince $n | km$, we have $km = sn$.\nSo, $k(a-b) = q(sn) = (qs)n$.\nSince $qs$ is an integer, $k(a-b)$ is a multiple of $n$. Thus, $n | k(a-b)$, which implies $ka \\equiv kb \\pmod n$.\nThis confirms that the map is well-defined if and only if $n | km$.\n\n**2. Homomorphism Property**\n\nA map $\\phi$ is a group homomorphism if it preserves the group structure. For the additive groups $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, this means for any $[a]_m, [b]_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_m$, we must have:\n$\\phi([a]_m + [b]_m) = \\phi([a]_m) + \\phi([b]_m)$.\n\nThe operation on the left side is in $\\mathbb{Z}_m$, and on the right side is in $\\mathbb{Z}_n$.\nLet's evaluate both sides.\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\nLHS = $\\phi([a]_m + [b]_m) = \\phi([a+b]_m)$\nBy the definition of $\\phi$, this is $[k(a+b)]_n$.\nUsing the distributive property of integers, this becomes $[ka + kb]_n$.\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\nRHS = $\\phi([a]_m) + \\phi([b]_m) = [ka]_n + [kb]_n$.\nBy the definition of addition in $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, this is $[ka + kb]_n$.\n\nSince LHS = RHS ($[ka + kb]_n = [ka + kb]_n$), the homomorphism property holds for any integer $k$ without imposing any additional conditions. The structure is preserved due to the distributive property of multiplication over addition in the integers, which is inherited by the modular arithmetic systems.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe homomorphism property is always satisfied. Therefore, the only condition required for $\\phi$ to be a well-defined group homomorphism is the condition for it to be well-defined, which we found to be $n | km$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. $n$ divides $km$ - This matches our derived condition.\nB. $m$ divides $kn$ - This is incorrect.\nC. $k$ divides $n$ - This is a stronger condition than necessary, but not sufficient in all cases (e.g., if $k=2, n=4, m=3$, then $4|2*3=6$ is false, but $k|n$ is true).\nD. $k$ divides $m$ - This is not the correct condition.\nE. The greatest common divisor of $k$ and $n$ is 1 - This is related to other properties, but not well-definedness in general.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition is $n | km$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1810562"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of well-definedness, we now turn to verifying the properties of a morphism between more complex objects.
