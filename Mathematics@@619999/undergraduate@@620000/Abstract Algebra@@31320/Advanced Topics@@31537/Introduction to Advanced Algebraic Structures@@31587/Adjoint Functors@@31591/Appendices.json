A particularly important example is a Partially Ordered Set (poset), which is a set $S$ equipped with a binary relation $\\le$ that is reflexive ($a \\le a$), antisymmetric (if $a \\le b$ and $b \\le a$, then $a = b$), and transitive (if $a \\le b$ and $b \\le c$, then $a \\le c$).\n\nThe concept of a function between sets can be extended to posets. A map $f: (S_1, \\le_1) \\to (S_2, \\le_2)$ between two posets is called **monotone** if it preserves the order, meaning that for any $a, b \\in S_1$, if $a \\le_1 b$, then $f(a) \\le_2 f(b)$.\n\nWe can define a special relationship between two monotone maps going in opposite directions. Let $(X, \\le_X)$ and $(Y, \\le_Y)$ be two posets, and let $L: X \\to Y$ and $R: Y \\to X$ be two monotone maps.
