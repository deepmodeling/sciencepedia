Since $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is a principal ideal ring, all of its ideals are generated by a single element. The ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ correspond to the principal ideals $\\langle d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of $n$. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n1.

The non-trivial ideals are $\\langle 2 \\rangle$ and $\\langle 1 \\rangle$.\n\nThe set of non-trivial proper ideals is the intersection of these two sets, which contains only one ideal: $\\langle 2 \\rangle$.\nThis finding immediately rules out options C, D, and E, as they make incorrect claims about the number of non-trivial proper ideals. The correct statement must be either A or B.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if the ideal $\\langle 2 \\rangle$ is a projective $R$-module.**\nWe need to check if $I = \\langle 2 \\rangle$ is a projective module over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}_4$. There are several equivalent characterizations of projective modules. We will use a powerful result for ideals in a commutative ring.\n\nA key theorem states that for a commutative ring with identity $R$, an ideal $I$ is a projective $R$-module if and only if $I$ is generated by a single idempotent element. An element $e \\in R$ is called idempotent if $e^2 = e$.\n\nLet's find all idempotent elements in $R = \\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n-   $0^2 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. So, 0 is an idempotent.\n-   $1^2 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. So, 1 is an idempotent.\n-   $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. Since $0 \\neq 2$, 2 is not an idempotent.\n-   $3^2 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. Since $1 \\neq 3$, 3 is not an idempotent.\n\nThe only idempotent elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ are 0 and 1.\n-   The ideal generated by the idempotent 0 is $\\langle 0 \\rangle = \\{0\\}$, which is a trivial ideal. (Note: The zero module is always projective).\n-   The ideal generated by the idempotent 1 is $\\langle 1 \\rangle = R$. The ring $R$ itself is a free module of rank 1, and all free modules are projective.\n\nThe ideal in question is $I = \\langle 2 \\rangle$. The only non-zero element in this ideal is 2, which is its generator. We have already shown that 2 is not an idempotent element. Since the ideal $\\langle 2 \\rangle$ is not generated by an idempotent, it cannot be a projective $R$-module.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the splitting of short exact sequences. An $R$-module $P$ is projective if every short exact sequence $0 \\to A \\to B \\to P \\to 0$ splits. Consider the surjective homomorphism $\\pi: R \\to \\langle 2 \\rangle$ defined by $\\pi(r) = 2r$. The kernel of $\\pi$ is $\\ker(\\pi)=\\{r \\in R \\mid 2r=0\\} = \\{0, 2\\} = \\langle 2 \\rangle$. This gives a short exact sequence:\n$$0 \\to \\langle 2 \\rangle \\xrightarrow{i} R \\xrightarrow{\\pi} \\langle 2 \\rangle \\to 0$$\nwhere $i$ is the inclusion map. For $\\langle 2 \\rangle$ to be projective, this sequence must split. This means there must exist an $R$-module homomorphism $s: \\langle 2 \\rangle \\to R$ such that $\\pi \\circ s = \\text{id}_{\\langle 2 \\rangle}$.\nLet $s(2) = x \\in R$. For $s$ to be a module homomorphism, we need $s(r \\cdot y) = r \\cdot s(y)$ for all $r \\in R, y \\in \\langle 2 \\rangle$. With $r=2, y=2$, we have $s(2 \\cdot 2) = s(0) = 0$. On the other hand, $2 \\cdot s(2) = 2x$. So we must have $2x=0$ in $R$. This implies $x$ can be 0 or 2.\nThe splitting condition requires $\\pi(s(2)) = 2$.\n- If $s(2)=0$, then $\\pi(s(2)) = \\pi(0) = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\neq 2$.\n- If $s(2)=2$, then $\\pi(s(2)) = \\pi(2) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 0 \\neq 2$.\nNeither choice for $x$ works. Thus, no such homomorphism $s$ exists, the sequence does not split, and $\\langle 2 \\rangle$ is not projective.\n\nConclusion: The only non-trivial proper ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is $\\langle 2 \\rangle$, and it is not a projective module.
