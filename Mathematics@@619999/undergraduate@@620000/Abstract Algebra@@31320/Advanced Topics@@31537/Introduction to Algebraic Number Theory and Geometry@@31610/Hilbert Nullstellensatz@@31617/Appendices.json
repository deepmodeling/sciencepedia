Since the ideal $I$ is generated by the polynomial $x^2 + y^2$, this is equivalent to finding all points $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ that satisfy the equation:\n$$x^2 + y^2 = 0$$\nHere, $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

The sum of two non-negative numbers can only be zero if both numbers are themselves zero.\nSo, the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 0$ implies that we must have $x^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$.

The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed, which allows for more factorization possibilities. We can factor the polynomial $x^2 + y^2$ using the imaginary unit $i$, where $i^2 = -1$:\n$$x^2 - (i^2)y^2 = 0$$\n$$(x - iy)(x + iy) = 0$$\nIn a field (and more generally, an integral domain like $\\mathbb{C}[x, y]$), a product of two elements is zero if and only if at least one of the elements is zero.
