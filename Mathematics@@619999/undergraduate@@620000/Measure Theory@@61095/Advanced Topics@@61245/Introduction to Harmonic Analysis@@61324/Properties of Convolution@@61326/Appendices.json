This exercise anchors the abstract concept of convolution in the familiar world of polynomial algebra.

For two finite sequences of real numbers, $a = (a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{m-1})$ and $b = (b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_{n-1})$, their discrete convolution is defined as the sequence $c = a * b$ whose $k$-th term is given by:\n$$c_k = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} a_j b_{k-j}$$\nThe indices of the sequences start at 0. If an index in the sum is outside the defined range for a sequence (e.g., $a_j$ where $j \\ge m$), the corresponding term is taken to be zero. The resulting sequence $c$ has $m+n-1$ terms, corresponding to indices $k = 0, 1, \\dots, m+n-2$.\n\nThere exists a powerful connection between the convolution of sequences and the multiplication of polynomials. This is often referred to as the Convolution Theorem. If we form polynomials using the sequences as coefficients, the coefficients of the product of these polynomials are precisely the convolution of the original sequences.\n\nConsider the specific sequences $a = (1, 2, 1)$ and $b = (1, -1)$. Using these sequences, we can form the polynomials $P_a(x) = 1 + 2x + x^2$ and $P_b(x) = 1 - x$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the product polynomial $P_c(x) = P_a(x) \\cdot P_b(x)$ and determine its sequence of coefficients, ordered by increasing powers of $x$. This resulting sequence is the discrete convolution of $a$ and $b$.

Since $m=3$ and $n=2$, the result has $m+n-1=4$ coefficients for $k=0,1,2,3$.\n\nFirst compute the product polynomial using the distributive law:\n$$\nP_{c}(x)=(1+2x+x^{2})(1-x)=(1+2x+x^{2})-x(1+2x+x^{2})=1+2x+x^{2}-x-2x^{2}-x^{3}=1+x-x^{2}-x^{3}.\n$$\nThus the coefficients, in increasing powers of $x$, are $1,1,-1,-1$.\n\nEquivalently, confirm via convolution term by term:\n$$\nc_{0}=a_{0}b_{0}=1,\\quad\nc_{1}=a_{0}b_{1}+a_{1}b_{0}=-1+2=1,\\quad\nc_{2}=a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{0}=-2+1=-1,\\quad\nc_{3}=a_{2}b_{1}= -1.\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same sequence of coefficients, ordered by increasing powers of $x$, which we present as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 & -1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1438783"}, {"introduction": "Moving from discrete sequences to continuous functions, we now define convolution using an integral, a cornerstone of signal processing and analysis.
