In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this is an open disk defined by the inequality $x^2 + y^2 < r^2$. Its area is given by the standard formula:\n$$ m(B(p, r)) = m(\\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 < r^2\\}) = \\pi r^2 $$\n\nNext, we consider the numerator, which is the measure of the intersection of the set $E$ (the x-axis) and the ball $B(p, r)$. The intersection consists of all points that are both on the x-axis and inside the open disk of radius $r$.\n$$ E \\cap B(p, r) = \\{(x, 0) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} \\cap \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 < r^2\\} $$\nA point $(x, y)$ is in this intersection if and only if $y=0$ and $x^2 + 0^2 < r^2$. This simplifies to $x^2 < r^2$, which means $-r < x < r$.\nTherefore, the intersection is the open line segment on the x-axis from $(-r, 0)$ to $(r, 0)$:\n$$ E \\cap B(p, r) = \\{(x, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid -r < x < r\\} $$\nThe two-dimensional Lebesgue measure $m$ quantifies area. A line segment, being a one-dimensional object embedded in a two-dimensional space, has zero width and thus its area is zero.\n$$ m(E \\cap B(p, r)) = 0 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute these measures back into the density formula. For any given $r > 0$, the ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{m(E \\cap B(p, r))}{m(B(p, r))} = \\frac{0}{\\pi r^2} = 0 $$\n\nFinally, we take the limit as $r$ approaches $0$ from the right. Since the expression is constant for all $r>0$, the limit is straightforward:\n$$ d(E, p) = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} 0 = 0 $$\nThus, the Lebesgue density of the x-axis at the origin is 0.
