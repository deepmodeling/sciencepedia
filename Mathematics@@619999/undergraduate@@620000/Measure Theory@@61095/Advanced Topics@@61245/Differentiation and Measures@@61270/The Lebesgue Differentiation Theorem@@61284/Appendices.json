This function is continuous everywhere. A continuous function is always locally integrable. Furthermore, for a function that is continuous at a point $x_0$, the conclusion of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem holds exactly at that point (not just \"almost everywhere\").\n\nSince $f(x, y) = x$ is continuous for all points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we can directly apply the theorem for any point $P = (a, b)$. The limit of the average value of $f$ over disks centered at $P$ as the radius shrinks to zero will be the value of the function $f$ evaluated at $P$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\nL = f(P) = f(a, b) = a.\n$$\nThis method is very direct and relies on understanding the conceptual meaning of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation**\n\nWe can also compute the limit by explicitly evaluating the integral.
