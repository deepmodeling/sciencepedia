Our first exercise provides a concrete opportunity to see this theorem in action with a function that is continuous but not differentiable everywhere. By working with $F(x) = \\max(x, x^2)$, you will practice finding a derivative that exists 'almost everywhere' and verifying that integrating this derivative correctly recovers the change in the function, just as the theorem predicts [@problem_id:1451735].", "problem": "A function $F(x)$ is defined on the real numbers by the expression $F(x) = \\max(x, x^2)$. The derivative of this function, denoted $F'(x)$, exists for almost every real number $x$. Your task is to calculate the value of the Lebesgue integral of this derivative over the closed interval $[0, 2]$.\n\nSpecifically, compute the value of the integral $\\int_{[0,2]} F'(t) d\\lambda(t)$, where $\\lambda$ represents the Lebesgue measure on the real line $\\mathbb{R}$.
