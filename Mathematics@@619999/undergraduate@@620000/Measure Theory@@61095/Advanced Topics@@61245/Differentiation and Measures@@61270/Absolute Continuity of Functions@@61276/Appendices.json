In our case, we will check for absolute continuity on the subintervals $[-1, 0]$ and $[0, 1]$ and ensure the function is continuous on the entire interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nFirst, let's check for continuity of $f(x)$ on $[-1, 1]$. The function is defined by elementary functions on $[-1, 0)$ and $(0, 1]$, so it is continuous there. We only need to check continuity at $x=0$. For continuity at $x=0$, we require $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = f(0)$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0)$.\nWe are given $f(0)=0$.\nThe limit from the left is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} |x|^{\\beta} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} (-x)^{\\beta} $$\nSince $\\beta  0$ is given, this limit is $0$.\nThe limit from the right is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x^{\\alpha} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2x}\\right) $$\nSince $\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2x}\\right)\\right| \\le 1$, we have $0 \\le \\left|x^{\\alpha} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2x}\\right)\\right| \\le x^{\\alpha}$. As $x \\to 0^+$, $x^{\\alpha} \\to 0$ because $\\alpha  0$ is given.
