We will examine an indicator function, which is one of the simplest yet most fundamental types of functions in measure theory.

The codomain for our function will be the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with its standard Borel $\\sigma$-algebra, $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nIn measure theory, a function from a measure space to another is called a random variable if it is measurable.\n\nConsider a function $X: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by the indicator function of the closed first quadrant.

By definition, a function $X: (\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}) \\to (S', \\mathcal{F}')$ is measurable if for every set $B \\in \\mathcal{F}'$, its pre-image $X^{-1}(B) = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X(\\omega) \\in B\\}$ is an element of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nIn this problem, the domain space is $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}) = (\\mathbb{R}^2, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2))$ and the codomain space is $(S', \\mathcal{F}') = (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}))$.

The range of the function $X$ is the set $\\{0, 1\\}$.

We can analyze the pre-image $X^{-1}(B)$ based on how $B$ intersects with the range $\\{0, 1\\}$:\n1.  If $0 \\notin B$ and $1 \\notin B$, then $X^{-1}(B) = \\emptyset$.

The entire space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is always an element of its own $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\n\nThe function $X$ is a random variable if the sets $Q$ and $Q^c$ are in $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\nLet's examine the set $Q = [0, \\infty) \\times [0, \\infty)$. The interval $[0, \\infty)$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$. Every closed set in a topological space is a member of the corresponding Borel $\\sigma$-algebra. Therefore, $[0, \\infty)$ is a Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $[0, \\infty) \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on the product space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, denoted $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, contains all sets of the form $B_1 \\times B_2$ where $B_1, B_2 \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$. Since $[0, \\infty) \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$, the product set $Q = [0, \\infty) \\times [0, \\infty)$ is an element of $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\nSince $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra, it is closed under complementation. As $Q \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, its complement $Q^c = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus Q$ must also be in $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\nSince all possible pre-images ($\\emptyset, Q, Q^c, \\mathbb{R}^2$) are elements of $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, the function $X$ is measurable and is therefore a random variable.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. This statement says $X$ is a random variable because the pre-image of any Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is the precise definition of a measurable function in this context, and our analysis has confirmed it to be true. This option is correct.\nB. This option claims $X$ is a random variable because its range $\\{0,1\\}$ is a Borel set. While the range is indeed a Borel set (any finite set of real numbers is closed and thus a Borel set), this is not the condition for a function to be measurable. The condition is on the pre-images, not the range itself. So, the reasoning is incorrect.\nC. This option claims that a random variable must be continuous. This is false. Discontinuous functions can be measurable. The function $X$ is a classic example of a discontinuous but measurable function.\nD. This option claims that unboundedness of the set where $X=1$ is a problem. This is false. Unbounded sets, such as the closed first quadrant $Q$, can be (and in this case, are) perfectly valid Borel sets. The boundedness of a set is irrelevant to its measurability.\nE. This option makes a blanket statement that all indicator functions are random variables. This is not true in general. An indicator function $I_A$ is a random variable if and only if the set $A$ is a member of the domain's $\\sigma$-algebra. For example, if we took $A$ to be a non-Borel set (like a Vitali set), then its indicator function would not be a random variable with respect to the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra.
