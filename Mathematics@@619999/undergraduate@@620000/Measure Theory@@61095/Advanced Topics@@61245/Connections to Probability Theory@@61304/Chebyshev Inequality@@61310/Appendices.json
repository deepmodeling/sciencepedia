This skill of building a \"worst-case\" example is crucial for appreciating the theoretical strength and sharpness of mathematical bounds.", "problem": "A statistician is designing a test case to demonstrate the sharpness of Chebyshev's inequality. To do this, they aim to construct a simple discrete random variable $X$ for which the inequality's upper bound is achieved for a specific parameter. The random variable $X$ is constructed with the following properties:\n\n1.  $X$ is a discrete random variable that can take on exactly three distinct real values.\n2.  One of the values that $X$ can take is its own mean, $\\mu = E[X]$.\n3.  The probability distribution of $X$ is symmetric about its mean. This means that for any real number $d>0$, the probability of $X$ taking a value $\\mu-d$ is equal to the probability of it taking the value $\\mu+d$, provided both are possible outcomes for $X$.\n4.  The random variable is constructed such that the bound given by Chebyshev's inequality is met exactly for the case $k=2$. That is, the probability of $X$ deviating from its mean by at least two standard deviations is exactly equal to the theoretical upper bound, i.e., $P(|X - \\mu| \\ge 2\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of $X$.\n\nGiven these properties, determine the probability that the random variable $X$ takes the value of its mean. Express your answer as a fraction or a decimal.", "solution": "Let the three distinct values the random variable $X$ can take be $v_1, v_2, v_3$.\nLet the mean of the random variable be $\\mu$.\n\nFrom property 2, one of the values is the mean itself. Let's set $v_2 = \\mu$.\n\nFrom property 3, the distribution is symmetric about the mean. Since the values must be distinct, the other two values must be equidistant from the mean. Let's define the other two values as $v_1 = \\mu - a$ and $v_3 = \\mu + a$ for some constant $a > 0$.\nSo, the set of possible values for $X$ is $\\{\\mu - a, \\mu, \\mu + a\\}$.\n\nAlso, due to the symmetry of the probability distribution (property 3), the probabilities of the outcomes equidistant from the mean must be equal. Let $P(X = \\mu - a) = p$. Then, we must have $P(X = \\mu + a) = p$.\n\nThe sum of all probabilities must be 1. So, we can find the probability of the central value:\n$P(X = \\mu - a) + P(X = \\mu) + P(X = \\mu + a) = 1$\n$p + P(X = \\mu) + p = 1$\n$P(X = \\mu) = 1 - 2p$.\nThe problem asks for this value, $P(X=\\mu)$. To find it, we need to determine the value of $p$.\n\nNext, we calculate the variance, $\\sigma^2$, of the random variable $X$. The variance is defined as $\\sigma^2 = E[(X-\\mu)^2]$.\nThe possible values for the quantity $(X-\\mu)$ are:\n- $(\\mu - a) - \\mu = -a$, which occurs with probability $p$.\n- $\\mu - \\mu = 0$, which occurs with probability $1 - 2p$.\n- $(\\mu + a) - \\mu = a$, which occurs with probability $p$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the variance:\n$\\sigma^2 = E[(X-\\mu)^2] = (-a)^2 \\cdot P(X = \\mu-a) + (0)^2 \\cdot P(X = \\mu) + (a)^2 \\cdot P(X = \\mu+a)$\n$\\sigma^2 = a^2 p + 0 \\cdot (1-2p) + a^2 p$\n$\\sigma^2 = 2pa^2$.\n\nThe standard deviation, $\\sigma$, is the square root of the variance:\n$\\sigma = \\sqrt{2pa^2} = a\\sqrt{2p}$ (since $a>0$).\n\nNow, we use the final piece of information given in property 4: $P(|X - \\mu| \\ge 2\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nLet's analyze the event $|X - \\mu| \\ge 2\\sigma$. The random variable $|X - \\mu|$ can take on the values $|-a| = a$ (with probability $p+p=2p$) and $|0| = 0$ (with probability $1-2p$).\nThe condition for the event is $|X - \\mu| \\ge 2(a\\sqrt{2p})$.\nFor the outcomes $X=\\mu-a$ or $X=\\mu+a$, the value of $|X-\\mu|$ is $a$.\nFor the outcome $X=\\mu$, the value of $|X-\\mu|$ is $0$.\nThe event $|X - \\mu| \\ge 2a\\sqrt{2p}$ occurs if and only if $|X-\\mu|=a$, because $a > 0$ and $2a\\sqrt{2p} > 0$. The outcome $|X-\\mu|=0$ will never satisfy the condition.\nThus, the probability of this event is simply the probability that $|X-\\mu|=a$.\n$P(|X - \\mu| \\ge 2\\sigma) = P(|X-\\mu|=a) = P(X=\\mu-a) + P(X=\\mu+a) = p + p = 2p$.\n\nWe are given that this probability is equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n$2p = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$p = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that $X$ takes the value of its mean, which is $P(X=\\mu)$. We found that this is equal to $1-2p$.\nSubstituting the value of $p$ we found:\n$P(X=\\mu) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nAs a final check, we can verify that the conditions are consistent. With $p=1/8$, the standard deviation is $\\sigma = a\\sqrt{2(1/8)} = a\\sqrt{1/4} = a/2$.\nThe condition $|X-\\mu| \\ge 2\\sigma$ becomes $|X-\\mu| \\ge 2(a/2)$, which simplifies to $|X-\\mu| \\ge a$.\nThe values of $|X-\\mu|$ are $a$ and $0$. The event $|X-\\mu| \\ge a$ is satisfied only when $|X-\\mu|=a$, which occurs with probability $2p = 2(1/8) = 1/4$. This matches the condition given in the problem, confirming our value of $p$ is correct.\nThe probability of $X$ being at its mean is indeed $3/4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$$", "id": "1348456"}]}
