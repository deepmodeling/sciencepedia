The set $S$ being infinite is equivalent to the event that $n U_n  1$ occurs for infinitely many values of $n$. This is a question about the long-term behavior of a sequence of events, which can be analyzed using the Borel-Cantelli lemmas.\n\nLet $A_n$ be the event that the inequality is satisfied for a given $n$. That is, $A_n = \\{n U_n  1\\}$. We can rewrite this inequality in terms of $U_n$ as $A_n = \\{U_n  1/n\\}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of each event $A_n$. Since each $U_n$ is uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$, the probability of $U_n$ being less than some value $x \\in [0, 1]$ is simply $x$. For any $n \\ge 1$, we have $1/n \\in (0, 1]$. Therefore, the probability of the event $A_n$ is:\n$$P(A_n) = P(U_n  1/n) = \\frac{1}{n}$$\n\nThe Borel-Cantelli lemmas relate the sum of the probabilities of a sequence of events to the probability that infinitely many of these events occur. Let's examine the sum of the probabilities $P(A_n)$:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}$$\nThis is the harmonic series, which is a well-known divergent series. Thus,\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n) = \\infty$$\n\nNow we apply the Borel-Cantelli lemmas.\nThe First Borel-Cantelli Lemma states that if $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n)  \\infty$, then $P(A_n \\text{ occurs infinitely often}) = 0$. Since our sum diverges, this lemma is not applicable.\n\nThe Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma states that if the events $A_1, A_2, \\ldots$ are independent and $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n) = \\infty$, then $P(A_n \\text{ occurs infinitely often}) = 1$.\n\nLet's check the independence condition. The problem states that the random variables $U_1, U_2, \\ldots$ are independent. The event $A_n = \\{U_n  1/n\\}$ depends only on the random variable $U_n$. Since the $U_n$ are mutually independent, the events $A_n$ are also mutually independent.\n\nBoth conditions for the Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma are satisfied:\n1. The events $\\{A_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ are independent.\n2. The sum of their probabilities, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n)$, diverges.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude from the Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma that the probability of the events $A_n$ occurring infinitely often is 1.\n$$P(A_n \\text{ occurs infinitely often}) = 1$$\nThis means that, with probability 1, the inequality $n U_n  1$ will be true for an infinite number of integers $n$.
