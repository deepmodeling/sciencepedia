The size of this group is $|\\mathfrak{S}_3| = 3! = 6$. Each permutation $\\sigma \\in \\mathfrak{S}_3$ defines an ordering of the coordinates.

This union consists of all points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for which all three coordinates are distinct. The complement of this union is the set of points where at least two coordinates are equal.

Since the measure $\\mu$ is the same for each component, the product measure element is preserved under this reordering. Thus,\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T_\\pi(A)) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\mathbf{1}_{A}(x_1, x_2, x_3) \\, d\\mu(x_1) d\\mu(x_2) d\\mu(x_3) = \\mathbb{P}(A) $$\nThis confirms that the measure $\\mathbb{P}$ is invariant under coordinate permutations.\n\nThe sets $E_\\sigma$ are related by these permutations. For any two permutations $\\sigma, \\tau \\in \\mathfrak{S}_3$, there exists a permutation $\\pi$ such that $E_\\tau = T_\\pi(E_\\sigma)$. Consequently, their measures must be equal: $\\mathbb{P}(E_\\tau) = \\mathbb{P}(T_\\pi(E_\\sigma)) = \\mathbb{P}(E_\\sigma)$.\nTherefore, all six sets $E_\\sigma$ have the same measure.
