It consists of all initial points $x_0$ that are in the observation window $A$, but whose subsequent iterates $x_n = T^n(x_0)$ for $n \\ge 1$ are all outside of $A$.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$S = \\{ x_0 \\in (1/2, 1] \\mid T^n(x_0) \\notin (1/2, 1] \\text{ for all integers } n \\ge 1 \\}$$\n\nThe orbit of any point $x_0 \\in [0, 1]$ under the map $T(x)=x^2$ remains in $[0, 1]$.

The largest term in this sequence is the first one, $T^1(x_0) = x_0^2$.\n\nSo, the infinite set of conditions $T^n(x_0) \\le 1/2$ for all $n \\ge 1$ simplifies to the single, most restrictive condition:\n$$T^1(x_0) \\le 1/2$$\nSubstituting the definition of $T$, we get:\n$$x_0^2 \\le 1/2$$\n\nSince $x_0$ is a state in $[0, 1]$, we are concerned with positive roots.
