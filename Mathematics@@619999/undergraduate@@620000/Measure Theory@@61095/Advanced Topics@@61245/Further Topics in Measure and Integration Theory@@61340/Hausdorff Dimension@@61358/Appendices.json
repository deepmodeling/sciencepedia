We can express this set as the union of two disjoint sets.\nLet $S_1 = \\{0\\} \\times [0, 1]$ and $S_2 = \\{1\\} \\times [0, 1]$.\nThen, the set $S$ can be written as $S = S_1 \\cup S_2$.\n\nAccording to Property 1 provided in the problem statement, for a finite union of sets, the Hausdorff dimension of the union is the maximum of the Hausdorff dimensions of the individual sets. Applying this property to $S$, we have:\n$$\n\\dim_H(S) = \\dim_H(S_1 \\cup S_2) = \\max\\{\\dim_H(S_1), \\dim_H(S_2)\\}\n$$\nOur next task is to determine the Hausdorff dimensions of $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n\nLet's first analyze the set $S_1 = \\{0\\} \\times [0, 1]$. This set represents a vertical line segment in the $\\mathbb{R}^2$ plane, extending from the point $(0, 0)$ to $(0, 1)$.\nWe compare this set to the interval $I = [0, 1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. From Property 3, we know that $\\dim_H(I) = 1$ since $0  1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the set $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and the set $S_1 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. Let's define a map $f: I \\to S_1$ by $f(y) = (0, y)$ for any $y \\in I$.\nWe can show that this map is an isometry. An isometry is a distance-preserving map. For any two points $y_a, y_b \\in I$, the distance between them in $\\mathbb{R}$ is $d_{\\mathbb{R}}(y_a, y_b) = |y_a - y_b|$.\nThe images of these points under $f$ are $f(y_a) = (0, y_a)$ and $f(y_b) = (0, y_b)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The Euclidean distance between these image points is:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(f(y_a), f(y_b)) = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (y_a - y_b)^2} = \\sqrt{(y_a - y_b)^2} = |y_a - y_b|\n$$\nSince $d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(f(y_a), f(y_b)) = d_{\\mathbb{R}}(y_a, y_b)$, the map $f$ is an isometry.\nAn isometry is a special case of a bi-Lipschitz map. According to Property 2, if there is an isometry between two sets, their Hausdorff dimensions are equal.\nTherefore, $\\dim_H(S_1) = \\dim_H(I)$.\nSince we know $\\dim_H(I) = 1$ from Property 3, we conclude that $\\dim_H(S_1) = 1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the set $S_2 = \\{1\\} \\times [0, 1]$. This set is also a vertical line segment in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, extending from $(1, 0)$ to $(1, 1)$.\nThe set $S_2$ is a translation of the set $S_1$ by the vector $(1, 0)$. A translation is an isometry.\nUsing Property 2 again, which states that isometric sets have the same Hausdorff dimension, we have:\n$$\n\\dim_H(S_2) = \\dim_H(S_1)\n$$\nSince we have already found that $\\dim_H(S_1) = 1$, it follows that $\\dim_H(S_2) = 1$.\nAlternatively, we could use the same argument as for $S_1$, defining an an isometry $g: I \\to S_2$ by $g(y) = (1, y)$ to show that $\\dim_H(S_2) = \\dim_H(I) = 1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the dimensions of $S_1$ and $S_2$ back into the expression for the dimension of $S$:\n$$\n\\dim_H(S) = \\max\\{\\dim_H(S_1), \\dim_H(S_2)\\} = \\max\\{1, 1\\} = 1\n$$\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the set $S = \\{0, 1\\} \\times [0, 1]$ is 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "1421061"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful applications of Hausdorff dimension is in characterizing fractals, especially those exhibiting self-similarity.
