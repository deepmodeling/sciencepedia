A primary tool for this is the Kolmogorov Extension Theorem.\n\nLet's define the family of finite-dimensional distributions (FDDs) for a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$. For any finite set of time points $0 \\le t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_n$, the random vector $(B_{t_1}, \\dots, B_{t_n})$ has a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and a covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ given by $\\Sigma_{ij} = \\min(t_i, t_j)$.

In our case, the state space is $S = \\mathbb{R}$ and the time index set is $T = [0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe KET therefore guarantees the existence of a probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$ on the space of all possible paths, $\\mathbb{R}^{[0, \\infty)}$, equipped with the product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})^{\\otimes [0, \\infty)}$. However, the ultimate goal is to define the Wiener measure, which is a measure on the space of *continuous* functions, denoted $C([0, \\infty), \\mathbb{R})$.

Consistency means that whenever $m<n$, the marginal of $(B_{t_{1}},\\ldots,B_{t_{n}})$ onto $(B_{t_{1}},\\ldots,B_{t_{m}})$ agrees with the prescribed law for the latter.\n\nBy the Kolmogorov Extension Theorem (KET), for a Polish state space $S=\\mathbb{R}$ and arbitrary index set $T=[0,\\infty)$, any such consistent family defines a unique probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$ on the measurable space $(\\mathbb{R}^{T},\\mathcal{F})$, where $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})^{\\otimes T}$ is the product $\\sigma$-algebra generated by finite-dimensional cylinder sets. Thus, KET applies to uncountable index sets, so it does not require $T$ to be countable; therefore, statement A is false. Likewise, consistency is a property indexed by finite sets and is unaffected by the cardinality of $T$; therefore, statement B is false. Moreover, KET requires $S$ to be a standard Borel (in particular, Polish) space, not compact; therefore, statement C is false.\n\nThe fundamental obstacle to directly obtaining a measure on the space of continuous paths is that the set\n$$\nC([0,\\infty),\\mathbb{R}) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{[0,\\infty)}\n$$\nis not an element of the product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})^{\\otimes [0,\\infty)}$.

Then there is a countable $J$ such that\n$$\nC([0,\\infty),\\mathbb{R})=\\pi_{J}^{-1}(B)\n$$\nfor some $B\\in\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})^{\\otimes J}$. Fix any continuous function $g$ (e.g., $g\\equiv 0$). Choose $t_{0}\\in [0,\\infty)\\setminus J$, which is possible since $J$ is countable and $[0,\\infty)$ is uncountable. Define a function $f$ by\n$$\nf(t)=\\begin{cases}\ng(t), & t\\neq t_{0},\\\\\ng(t_{0})+1, & t=t_{0}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThen $f$ and $g$ agree on $J$, so $\\pi_{J}(f)=\\pi_{J}(g)$, implying $f\\in C([0,\\infty),\\mathbb{R})$ if and only if $g\\in C([0,\\infty),\\mathbb{R})$.
