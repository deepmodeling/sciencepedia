Therefore, we can use closed intervals of the form $[-M, M]$ as our compact sets without loss of generality.\n\n**Part 1: Sufficiency (If $\\{c_n\\}$ is bounded, then $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ is tight)**\n\nAssume that the sequence of shifts $\\{c_n\\}$ is bounded. This means there exists a positive real number $C$ such that $|c_n| \\le C$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We want to show that the family $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ is tight.\n\nLet an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since the family $\\{\\mu_n\\}$ is tight, by definition, there exists a compact set $K_\\epsilon$ such that $\\mu_n(K_\\epsilon) > 1 - \\epsilon$ for all $n$. Because we are on the real line, we can choose this compact set to be a closed interval, say $K_\\epsilon = [-R, R]$ for some $R > 0$. So, we have:\n$$ \\mu_n([-R, R]) > 1 - \\epsilon \\quad \\text{for all } n. $$\nThe definition of the measure $\\nu_n$ is $\\nu_n(A) = \\mu_n(A - c_n)$. Equivalently, for any set $B$, $\\mu_n(B) = \\nu_n(B + c_n)$, where $B+c_n = \\{y+c_n \\mid y \\in B\\}$. Let's apply this to our inequality:\n$$ \\nu_n([-R, R] + c_n) > 1 - \\epsilon $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\nu_n([-R + c_n, R + c_n]) > 1 - \\epsilon \\quad \\text{for all } n. $$\nThe issue here is that the compact set $[-R + c_n, R + c_n]$ depends on $n$. To prove tightness for $\\{\\nu_n\\}$, we need to find a single compact set that works for all $n$.\n\nSince $\\{c_n\\}$ is bounded by $C$, we have $-C \\le c_n \\le C$. This implies:\n$$ -R - C \\le -R + c_n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R + c_n \\le R + C. $$\nTherefore, for every $n$, the interval $[-R + c_n, R + c_n]$ is contained within the larger, fixed interval $[-(R+C), R+C]$. Let's define the new compact set $K'_\\epsilon = [-(R+C), R+C]$.\n\nSince $[-R + c_n, R + c_n] \\subseteq K'_\\epsilon$, by the monotonicity of measures, we have:\n$$ \\nu_n(K'_\\epsilon) \\ge \\nu_n([-R + c_n, R + c_n]). $$\nCombining our inequalities, we get:\n$$ \\nu_n(K'_\\epsilon) > 1 - \\epsilon \\quad \\text{for all } n. $$\nWe have found a single compact set $K'_\\epsilon$ that contains at least $1-\\epsilon$ of the mass for every measure $\\nu_n$ in the family. Since $\\epsilon$ was arbitrary, this proves that the family $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ is tight. Thus, the boundedness of $\\{c_n\\}$ is a sufficient condition.\n\n**Part 2: Necessity (If $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ is tight, then $\\{c_n\\}$ must be bounded)**\n\nWe will prove this by contradiction. Assume that the family $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ is tight, but the sequence of shifts $\\{c_n\\}$ is not bounded.\n\nIf $\\{c_n\\}$ is not bounded, then for any $M > 0$, there exists an $n$ such that $|c_n| > M$. This implies that there exists a subsequence $\\{c_{n_k}\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ such that $|c_{n_k}| \\to \\infty$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\n\nSince both families $\\{\\mu_n\\}$ and $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ are tight, let's choose $\\epsilon = 1/4$.\nBecause $\\{\\mu_n\\}$ is tight, there exists a compact set $K_1 = [-R, R]$ for some $R>0$ such that:\n$$ \\mu_n(K_1) > 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 \\quad \\text{for all } n. $$\nBecause $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ is tight, there exists a compact set $K_2 = [-S, S]$ for some $S>0$ such that:\n$$ \\nu_n(K_2) > 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 \\quad \\text{for all } n. $$\nLet's focus on the subsequence $\\{n_k\\}$. The two conditions above must hold for all $n_k$:\n1. $\\mu_{n_k}([-R, R]) > 3/4$\n2. $\\nu_{n_k}([-S, S]) > 3/4$\n\nUsing the relation $\\mu_n(A) = \\nu_n(A+c_n)$, we can rewrite the first condition in terms of $\\nu_{n_k}$:\n$$ \\nu_{n_k}([-R + c_{n_k}, R + c_{n_k}]) > 3/4. $$\nSo, for the measure $\\nu_{n_k}$, we have two sets, $A_k = [-S, S]$ and $B_k = [-R + c_{n_k}, R + c_{n_k}]$, which both have a measure greater than $3/4$.\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for measures:\n$$ \\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cup B_k) = \\nu_{n_k}(A_k) + \\nu_{n_k}(B_k) - \\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cap B_k). $$\nSince $\\nu_{n_k}$ is a probability measure, $\\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cup B_k) \\le 1$.\n$$ 1 \\ge \\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cup B_k) > 3/4 + 3/4 - \\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cap B_k) = 3/2 - \\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cap B_k). $$\nThis implies $\\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cap B_k) > 3/2 - 1 = 1/2$.\nA necessary condition for $\\nu_{n_k}(A_k \\cap B_k) > 1/2$ is that the intersection of the sets is non-empty, i.e., $A_k \\cap B_k \\neq \\emptyset$.\n$$ [-S, S] \\cap [-R + c_{n_k}, R + c_{n_k}] \\neq \\emptyset. $$\nHowever, we assumed that $\\{c_n\\}$ is unbounded, and thus $|c_{n_k}| \\to \\infty$. This means that for any given number, we can find a $k$ such that $|c_{n_k}|$ is larger. Let's choose a $k$ large enough such that $|c_{n_k}| > R+S$.\n- If $c_{n_k} > R+S$, then the lower bound of the interval $B_k$ is $-R+c_{n_k} > -R+(R+S) = S$. The entire interval $B_k$ lies to the right of $S$.\n- If $c_{n_k} < -(R+S)$, then the upper bound of the interval $B_k$ is $R+c_{n_k} < R-(R+S) = -S$. The entire interval $B_k$ lies to the left of $-S$.\n\nIn both cases, for sufficiently large $k$, the interval $B_k$ is completely disjoint from the interval $A_k = [-S, S]$. This means their intersection is empty: $A_k \\cap B_k = \\emptyset$. This is a contradiction to our finding that their intersection must be non-empty.\nTherefore, the initial assumption that $\\{c_n\\}$ is unbounded must be false. The sequence $\\{c_n\\}$ must be bounded. This proves necessity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe boundedness of $\\{c_n\\}$ is both a necessary and sufficient condition for $\\{\\nu_n\\}$ to be tight.
