The set $S$ is a disjoint union of three sets: $S_1 = [1.5, 5.5]$, $S_2 = \\{6\\}$, and $S_3 = (7, 9]$. Since the sets are disjoint, the measure of the union is the sum of their measures:\n$$ \\mu(S) = \\mu(S_1) + \\mu(S_2) + \\mu(S_3) $$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the nature of the measure $\\mu$. The measure of a singleton set $\\{x\\}$ can be found by considering the limit of measures of shrinking intervals that converge to $\\{x\\}$. We can write $\\{x\\} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty (x - 1/n, x]$. By the continuity of measure from above for a decreasing sequence of sets, we have:\n$$ \\mu(\\{x\\}) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\mu((x - 1/n, x]) $$\nUsing the definition of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure, $\\mu((a, b]) = F(b) - F(a)$:\n$$ \\mu(\\{x\\}) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (F(x) - F(x - 1/n)) = F(x) - \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} F(x - 1/n) = F(x) - F(x^-) $$\nwhere $F(x^-)$ is the left-hand limit of $F$ at $x$. This value represents the size of the jump discontinuity of $F$ at the point $x$.\n\nLet's evaluate this jump for different values of $x$:\n1.  If $x$ is not a positive integer and $x \\neq 0$: The function $F(x)$ is continuous at such points. For instance, if $x \\in (k, k+1)$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$, then for a small enough $\\epsilon  0$, $F(x) = k$ and $F(x-\\epsilon) = k$, so the jump is $0$. If $x  0$, $F(x)=0$ and $F(x-\\epsilon)=0$, so the jump is $0$. Thus, $\\mu(\\{x\\}) = 0$ if $x$ is not a positive integer.\n2.  If $x=k$ for some positive integer $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$:\n    -   $F(k) = \\lfloor k \\rfloor = k$.\n    -   $F(k^-) = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^+} F(k-\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^+} \\lfloor k-\\epsilon \\rfloor = k-1$.\n    -   The jump is $\\mu(\\{k\\}) = F(k) - F(k^-) = k - (k-1) = 1$.\n3.  If $x = 0$: $F(0)=\\lfloor 0 \\rfloor = 0$ and for $\\epsilon  0$, $F(0-\\epsilon)=0$. So $\\mu(\\{0\\}) = 0-0=0$.\n\nThis analysis shows that the measure $\\mu$ is a discrete measure concentrated entirely on the set of positive integers $\\mathbb{Z}^+ = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.

There are 4 such integers.\n$$ \\mu(S_1) = \\mu([1.5, 5.5]) = |\\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}| = 4 $$\nAlternatively, we can compute this using the distribution function. Note that $[1.5, 5.5] = (1.5, 5.5] \\cup \\{1.5\\}$.\n$\\mu(\\{1.5\\}) = 0$ since $1.5$ is not a positive integer.\n$\\mu((1.5, 5.5]) = F(5.5) - F(1.5) = \\lfloor 5.5 \\rfloor - \\lfloor 1.5 \\rfloor = 5 - 1 = 4$.\nSo, $\\mu([1.5, 5.5]) = 4$.\n\nFor the second part, $S_2 = \\{6\\}$, we need the measure of the singleton set $\\{6\\}$. Since 6 is a positive integer, its measure is 1.\n$$ \\mu(S_2) = \\mu(\\{6\\}) = 1 $$\n\nFor the third part, $S_3 = (7, 9]$, we can use the definition of the measure directly:\n$$ \\mu(S_3) = \\mu((7, 9]) = F(9) - F(7) = \\lfloor 9 \\rfloor - \\lfloor 7 \\rfloor = 9 - 7 = 2 $$\nAlternatively, we count the positive integers in the interval $(7, 9]$. These are $\\{8, 9\\}$. There are 2 such integers.
