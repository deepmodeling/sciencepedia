According to the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem, any positive linear functional $\\Lambda$ on $C_c(X)$ can be represented by integration with respect to a unique positive Radon measure $\\mu$ on $X$, such that $\\Lambda(f) = \\int_X f \\,d\\mu$ for all $f \\in C_c(X)$.

Whether $\\Phi$ is a positive linear functional depends on the specific choice of the space $X$ and the measure $\\mu$.", "solution": "To determine which statement accurately describes the map $\\Phi(f) = \\Lambda(f^2)$, we need to check two properties: positivity and linearity. The map $\\Phi$ is a positive linear functional if and only if it satisfies both properties. We are given that $\\Lambda(f) = \\int_X f \\,d\\mu$ for a non-zero positive Radon measure $\\mu$. Therefore, the map $\\Phi$ can be written as $\\Phi(f) = \\int_X f(x)^2 \\,d\\mu$.\n\nFirst, let's check for positivity.\nA map $\\Phi$ is positive if for any function $f \\in C_c(X)$ such that $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in X$, we have $\\Phi(f) \\ge 0$.\nLet's take such a non-negative function $f \\in C_c(X)$. The problem asks for the value of $\\Phi(f) = \\int_X f(x)^2 \\,d\\mu$.\nSince $f$ is a real-valued function, the integrand $f(x)^2$ is always non-negative, i.e., $f(x)^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in X$.\nThe measure $\\mu$ is given to be a positive measure. The integral of a non-negative function with respect to a positive measure is always non-negative.\nTherefore, $\\int_X f(x)^2 \\,d\\mu \\ge 0$.\nThis means $\\Phi(f) \\ge 0$ for all non-negative $f \\in C_c(X)$. So, the map $\\Phi$ is positive.\nThis immediately eliminates options B and D.\n\nNext, let's check for linearity.\nA map $\\Phi$ is linear if it satisfies two conditions for all $f, g \\in C_c(X)$ and all scalars $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n1. Additivity: $\\Phi(f+g) = \\Phi(f) + \\Phi(g)$\n2. Homogeneity: $\\Phi(cf) = c\\Phi(f)$\n\nLet's check additivity.\nThe left-hand side is $\\Phi(f+g) = \\int_X (f(x)+g(x))^2 \\,d\\mu$.\nExpanding the square, we get:\n$\\Phi(f+g) = \\int_X (f(x)^2 + 2f(x)g(x) + g(x)^2) \\,d\\mu$.\nBy the linearity of the integral, we can split this into three terms:\n$\\Phi(f+g) = \\int_X f(x)^2 \\,d\\mu + \\int_X 2f(x)g(x) \\,d\\mu + \\int_X g(x)^2 \\,d\\mu$.\nUsing the definition of $\\Phi$, this becomes:\n$\\Phi(f+g) = \\Phi(f) + \\Phi(g) + 2\\int_X f(x)g(x) \\,d\\mu$.\nFor $\\Phi$ to be additive, we must have $\\Phi(f+g) = \\Phi(f) + \\Phi(g)$. This would require that $2\\int_X f(x)g(x) \\,d\\mu = 0$ for all choices of $f, g \\in C_c(X)$.\nHowever, since we are given that $\\Lambda$ is a non-zero functional, the measure $\\mu$ is not the zero measure. This means there exists some open set $U$ with $\\mu(U) > 0$. By Urysohn's Lemma for locally compact Hausdorff spaces, we can construct a non-zero function $f \\in C_c(X)$ with support inside $U$ such that $f(x) \\ge 0$ and $f$ is not identically zero. If we choose $g=f$, then $f(x)g(x) = f(x)^2 \\ge 0$ and is not identically zero. Thus, $\\int_X f(x)^2 \\,d\\mu > 0$. This provides a counterexample to the condition that $\\int_X f(x)g(x) \\,d\\mu = 0$ for all $f, g$.\nTherefore, additivity fails.\n\nSince a functional must satisfy both additivity and homogeneity to be linear, the failure of additivity is sufficient to conclude that $\\Phi$ is not linear. For completeness, let's also check homogeneity.\nThe left-hand side is $\\Phi(cf) = \\int_X (c f(x))^2 \\,d\\mu = \\int_X c^2 f(x)^2 \\,d\\mu$.\nFactoring out the constant $c^2$ from the integral, we get:\n$\\Phi(cf) = c^2 \\int_X f(x)^2 \\,d\\mu = c^2 \\Phi(f)$.\nFor homogeneity to hold, we must have $\\Phi(cf) = c\\Phi(f)$, which means $c^2 \\Phi(f) = c \\Phi(f)$ for all $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $f \\in C_c(X)$. This can be rewritten as $c(c-1)\\Phi(f) = 0$.\nAgain, since $\\mu$ is not the zero measure, we can choose a function $f$ such that $\\Phi(f) = \\int_X f^2 \\,d\\mu > 0$. For such a function $f$, the condition becomes $c(c-1) = 0$, which is only true for $c=0$ and $c=1$. It does not hold for all scalars $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (e.g., if $c=2$, we get $4\\Phi(f) = 2\\Phi(f)$, which implies $\\Phi(f)=0$, a contradiction). Thus, homogeneity also fails.\n\nSince $\\Phi$ fails both additivity and homogeneity, it is not a linear map.\nOur conclusion is that $\\Phi$ is a positive map, but it is not linear. This corresponds to option C. Option A is incorrect because $\\Phi$ is not linear. Option E is incorrect because the failure of linearity is a general result for any non-zero measure $\\mu$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1459614"}, {"introduction": "The Riesz Representation Theorem creates a powerful link between abstract functionals and concrete measures.
