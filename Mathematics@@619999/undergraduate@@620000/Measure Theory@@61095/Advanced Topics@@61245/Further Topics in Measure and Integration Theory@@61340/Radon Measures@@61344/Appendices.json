The first step is to characterize the measure $\\mu_F$ generated by the given cumulative distribution function $F(x)$.\n\nThe measure of a singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is given by the size of the jump of the function $F$ at the point $x$. This is calculated as $\\mu_F(\\{x\\}) = F(x) - F(x^-)$, where $F(x^-) = \\lim_{t \\to x^-} F(t)$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $F(x)$:\n1.  For any non-integer value $x_0$, the floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is locally constant around $x_0$. Therefore, $F(x)$ is continuous at any non-integer $x_0$.

For any negative integer $x_0 < 0$, $F(x)=0$ in a neighborhood of $x_0$, so it is continuous and the jump is $\\mu_F(\\{x_0\\}) = 0$.\n\n3.  For $x_0 = 0$, we have $F(0) = \\lfloor 0 \\rfloor = 0$.
