That is, we must verify if $m(g \\oplus S) = m(S)$ for every element $g \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and every Borel measurable set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIt is sufficient to test this property on a generating class of sets for the Borel sigma-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$, such as intervals. Let's consider an arbitrary interval $S = [a, b]$ with $a < b$. The Lebesgue measure of this interval is $m(S) = b-a$.\n\nNow, let's find the left-translated set $g \\oplus S$ for some $g \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$$g \\oplus S = \\{g \\oplus s \\mid s \\in S\\} = \\{\\sqrt[3]{g^3 + s^3} \\mid s \\in [a, b]\\}$$\nLet's analyze the function $f(s) = \\sqrt[3]{g^3 + s^3}$. The function $s \\mapsto s^3$ is a strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$. The function $t \\mapsto g^3 + t$ is also strictly increasing. Finally, the function $u \\mapsto \\sqrt[3]{u}$ is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $f(s)$ is a composition of strictly increasing functions, it is itself strictly increasing.\nBecause $f(s)$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function, it maps the interval $[a, b]$ to the interval $[f(a), f(b)]$.\nTherefore, the translated set is:\n$$g \\oplus S = \\left[\\sqrt[3]{g^3 + a^3}, \\sqrt[3]{g^3 + b^3}\\right]$$\nThe Lebesgue measure of this translated interval is the difference between its endpoints:\n$$m(g \\oplus S) = \\sqrt[3]{g^3 + b^3} - \\sqrt[3]{g^3 + a^3}$$\nFor the Lebesgue measure $m$ to be a left Haar measure, this must be equal to the measure of the original set, $m(S) = b-a$, for all choices of $g, a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$.\nSo, the condition is:\n$$\\sqrt[3]{g^3 + b^3} - \\sqrt[3]{g^3 + a^3} = b - a$$\nWe can test this condition with a specific counterexample. Let's choose a simple interval, say $S=[0, 1]$, so $a=0$ and $b=1$. The condition becomes:\n$$\\sqrt[3]{g^3 + 1^3} - \\sqrt[3]{g^3 + 0^3} = 1 - 0$$\n$$\\sqrt[3]{g^3 + 1} - \\sqrt[3]{g^3} = 1$$\n$$\\sqrt[3]{g^3 + 1} - g = 1$$\n$$\\sqrt[3]{g^3 + 1} = g + 1$$\nCubing both sides of the equation, we get:\n$$g^3 + 1 = (g + 1)^3$$\n$$g^3 + 1 = g^3 + 3g^2 + 3g + 1$$\n$$0 = 3g^2 + 3g$$\n$$0 = 3g(g + 1)$$\nThis equation has solutions $g=0$ and $g=-1$.\nThe translation-invariance property must hold for all $g \\in \\mathbb{R}$. However, we have shown that for the interval $[0,1]$, the equality only holds for $g=0$ (the identity element, for which translation is trivial) and $g=-1$. For any other value of $g$, the condition is not met. For instance, if we choose $g=1$:\n$$m(1 \\oplus [0,1]) = \\sqrt[3]{1^3 + 1^3} - \\sqrt[3]{1^3 + 0^3} = \\sqrt[3]{2} - 1$$\nSince $\\sqrt[3]{2} - 1 \\approx 1.26 - 1 = 0.26$, this is not equal to $m([0,1]) = 1$.\nBecause we have found a counterexample, the Lebesgue measure $m$ is not invariant under the left translation by the group operation $\\oplus$. Therefore, $m$ is not a left Haar measure for the group $G$. This makes option B the correct answer.\n\nWe can also analyze the other options.\nOption C: The group operation $\\oplus$ is commutative, since $x \\oplus y = \\sqrt[3]{x^3 + y^3} = \\sqrt[3]{y^3 + x^3} = y \\oplus x$. For a commutative (abelian) group, the concepts of left-translation invariance and right-translation invariance are identical. Thus, if the measure is not a left Haar measure, it cannot be a right Haar measure either. So, option C is incorrect.\nOption D: The space is $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, which is a locally compact Hausdorff space. It is stated in the problem that $(\\mathbb{R}, \\oplus)$ is a topological group. A topological group on a locally compact space is a locally compact group. Thus, the premise of option D is false.
