For any set $E \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}$, the measure of $E$ is the sum of the measures of its elements. For a measure $\\mu$ and a set $E$, we have $\\mu(E) = \\sum_{x \\in E} \\mu(\\{x\\})$. Since measures are non-negative, $\\mu(E) = 0$ if and only if $\\mu(\\{x\\}) = 0$ for all $x \\in E$.\n\nThis simplifies the condition for absolute continuity on a finite space. The statement $\\nu \\ll \\mu$ is equivalent to the condition that for any element $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$, if $\\mu(\\{x\\}) = 0$, then $\\nu(\\{x\\}) = 0$. This is the same as saying that the support of $\\nu$ must be a subset of the support of $\\mu$, where the support of a measure is the set of elements with non-zero measure.\nLet $\\text{supp}(\\mu) = \\{x \\in \\mathcal{A} \\mid \\mu(\\{x\\}) > 0\\}$. Then, $\\nu \\ll \\mu$ if and only if $\\text{supp}(\\nu) \\subseteq \\text{supp}(\\mu)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the supports for $P_\\alpha$ and $P_\\beta$.\n\nThe probabilities for $P_\\alpha$ are:\n$P_\\alpha(\\{A_1\\}) = 1/3 > 0$\n$P_\\alpha(\\{A_2\\}) = 1/2 > 0$\n$P_\\alpha(\\{A_3\\}) = 0$\n$P_\\alpha(\\{A_4\\}) = 1/12 > 0$\n$P_\\alpha(\\{A_5\\}) = 1/12 > 0$\nSo, the support of $P_\\alpha$ is $\\text{supp}(P_\\alpha) = \\{A_1, A_2, A_4, A_5\\}$.\n\nThe probabilities for $P_\\beta$ are:\n$P_\\beta(\\{A_1\\}) = 1/4 > 0$\n$P_\\beta(\\{A_2\\}) = 1/4 > 0$\n$P_\\beta(\\{A_3\\}) = 1/8 > 0$\n$P_\\beta(\\{A_4\\}) = 1/4 > 0$\n$P_\\beta(\\{A_5\\}) = 1/8 > 0$\nAll probabilities are non-zero. So, the support of $P_\\beta$ is $\\text{supp}(P_\\beta) = \\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5\\} = \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nNow we can check the two possible absolute continuity relationships.\n\n1.  Is $P_\\alpha$ absolutely continuous with respect to $P_\\beta$ ($P_\\alpha \\ll P_\\beta$)?\n    This holds if and only if $\\text{supp}(P_\\alpha) \\subseteq \\text{supp}(P_\\beta)$.\n    We have $\\text{supp}(P_\\alpha) = \\{A_1, A_2, A_4, A_5\\}$ and $\\text{supp}(P_\\beta) = \\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5\\}$.\n    Since every element in $\\text{supp}(P_\\alpha)$ is also in $\\text{supp}(P_\\beta)$, the condition $\\text{supp}(P_\\alpha) \\subseteq \\text{supp}(P_\\beta)$ is satisfied.\n    Therefore, $P_\\alpha$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $P_\\beta$.\n\n2.  Is $P_\\beta$ absolutely continuous with respect to $P_\\alpha$ ($P_\\beta \\ll P_\\alpha$)?\n    This holds if and only if $\\text{supp}(P_\\beta) \\subseteq \\text{supp}(P_\\alpha)$.\n    We have $\\text{supp}(P_\\beta) = \\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5\\}$ and $\\text{supp}(P_\\alpha) = \\{A_1, A_2, A_4, A_5\\}$.\n    The element $A_3$ is in $\\text{supp}(P_\\beta)$ but not in $\\text{supp}(P_\\alpha)$. Therefore, the condition $\\text{supp}(P_\\beta) \\subseteq \\text{supp}(P_\\alpha)$ is not satisfied.\n    To show this formally using the original definition, consider the event $E = \\{A_3\\}$. We have $P_\\alpha(E) = P_\\alpha(\\{A_3\\}) = 0$. However, $P_\\beta(E) = P_\\beta(\\{A_3\\}) = 1/8 \\neq 0$. This is a direct violation of the definition for $P_\\beta \\ll P_\\alpha$.\n    Therefore, $P_\\beta$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $P_\\alpha$.\n\nOur conclusion is that $P_\\alpha$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $P_\\beta$, but $P_\\beta$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $P_\\alpha$.
