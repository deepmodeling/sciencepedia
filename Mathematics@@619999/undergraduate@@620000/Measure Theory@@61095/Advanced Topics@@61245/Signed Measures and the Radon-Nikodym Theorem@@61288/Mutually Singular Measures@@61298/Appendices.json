Mutual Singularity ($\\mu \\perp \\nu$)**\n\nTwo measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are mutually singular if there exist two disjoint measurable sets, $A$ and $B$, such that their union covers the entire space ($\\mathbb{R} = A \\cup B$), and $\\mu$ is concentrated on $A$ while $\\nu$ is concentrated on $B$. This is equivalent to finding a partition of $\\mathbb{R}$ into $A$ and $B$ such that $\\mu(B) = 0$ and $\\nu(A) = 0$.\n\nLet's propose a natural partition of $\\mathbb{R}$ based on the problem's setup. Let $A = (0, \\infty)$ and $B = (-\\infty, 0]$. Clearly, $A$ and $B$ are disjoint Borel sets and their union is $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we must check if $\\mu(B) = 0$ and $\\nu(A) = 0$.\n\n1.  **Check $\\mu(B) = 0$:**\n    The set is $B = (-\\infty, 0]$. The problem statement explicitly gives that $\\mu((-\\infty, 0]) = 0$. So, $\\mu(B) = 0$ is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Check $\\nu(A) = 0$:**\n    The set is $A = (0, \\infty)$. By the definition of $\\nu$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\nu(A) = \\nu((0, \\infty)) = \\mu(\\{-x \\mid x \\in (0, \\infty)\\})\n    $$\n    The set $\\{-x \\mid x \\in (0, \\infty)\\}$ is the set of all negative real numbers, which is the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. So, we have:\n    $$\n    \\nu(A) = \\mu((-\\infty, 0))\n    $$\n    Since $(-\\infty, 0)$ is a subset of $(-\\infty, 0]$, and measures are monotone, we know that $\\mu((-\\infty, 0)) \\le \\mu((-\\infty, 0])$. We are given that $\\mu((-\\infty, 0]) = 0$. Therefore, $\\mu((-\\infty, 0)) = 0$. This implies that $\\nu(A) = 0$.\n\nSince we have found disjoint sets $A=(0, \\infty)$ and $B=(-\\infty, 0]$ such that $\\mathbb{R} = A \\cup B$, $\\mu(B) = 0$, and $\\nu(A) = 0$, the measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are mutually singular. Thus, statement A is correct.\n\nFor completeness, let's analyze the other options to confirm they are incorrect.\n\n**B. Absolute Continuity ($\\nu \\ll \\mu$)**\n\nThe measure $\\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\mu$ if for every set $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $\\mu(E) = 0$, it follows that $\\nu(E) = 0$.\n\nLet's test this with a specific set. Consider the set $E = (-\\infty, 0)$. As shown above, since $E \\subseteq (-\\infty, 0]$, we have $\\mu(E) \\le \\mu((-\\infty, 0]) = 0$, which means $\\mu(E) = 0$. Now let's compute $\\nu(E)$:\n$$\n\\nu(E) = \\nu((-\\infty, 0)) = \\mu(\\{-x \\mid x \\in (-\\infty, 0)\\}) = \\mu((0, \\infty))\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\mu$ is a non-zero measure. Since $\\mu((-\\infty, 0])=0$, the entire \"mass\" of the measure must be on $(0, \\infty)$. That is, $\\mu(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mu((-\\infty, 0]) + \\mu((0, \\infty)) = 0 + \\mu((0, \\infty))$. Since $\\mu$ is non-zero, $\\mu(\\mathbb{R}) > 0$, and so $\\mu((0, \\infty)) > 0$.\nThus, we have found a set $E=(-\\infty, 0)$ for which $\\mu(E)=0$ but $\\nu(E) = \\mu((0, \\infty)) > 0$. Therefore, $\\nu$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $\\mu$. Statement B is incorrect.\n\n**C. Absolute Continuity ($\\mu \\ll \\nu$)**\n\nThe measure $\\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\nu$ if for every set $F \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $\\nu(F) = 0$, it follows that $\\mu(F) = 0$.\n\nLet's test this. Consider the set $F = (0, \\infty)$. We have already calculated $\\nu(F)$:\n$$\n\\nu(F) = \\nu((0, \\infty)) = \\mu((-\\infty, 0)) = 0\n$$\nNow, what is $\\mu(F)$? We have $\\mu(F) = \\mu((0, \\infty))$. As established in the analysis of option B, $\\mu((0, \\infty)) > 0$ because $\\mu$ is a non-zero measure.\nSo we have found a set $F=(0, \\infty)$ for which $\\nu(F)=0$ but $\\mu(F) > 0$. Therefore, $\\mu$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $\\nu$. Statement C is incorrect.\n\n**D. Equivalence ($\\mu \\sim \\nu$)**\n\nTwo measures are equivalent if they are mutually absolutely continuous ($\\mu \\ll \\nu$ and $\\nu \\ll \\mu$). Since we have shown that both B and C are false, this statement is also false.\n\n**E. The measure $\\nu$ is the zero measure**\n\nFor $\\nu$ to be the zero measure, we would need $\\nu(E)=0$ for all $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$. Let's test this with $E = (-\\infty, 0)$.\n$$\n\\nu((-\\infty, 0)) = \\mu((0, \\infty))\n$$\nAs established, since $\\mu$ is non-zero and supported on $(0, \\infty)$, we have $\\mu((0, \\infty)) > 0$. Thus $\\nu((-\\infty, 0)) > 0$, which means $\\nu$ is not the zero measure.
