This is because $p \\in [1, \\infty)$, so $1/p$ is a positive finite exponent. A positive power of a non-negative value is finite if and only if the value itself is finite.\n\nWe now need to evaluate the improper integral $I = \\int_{0}^{1} x^{-p/3} dx$ and find the condition on $p$ for which it converges. This is a standard p-integral of the form $\\int_0^a x^{-k} dx$ with $k=p/3$.

The integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} x^{-k} dx$.\nIf $k \\neq 1$, the antiderivative of $x^{-k}$ is $\\frac{x^{-k+1}}{-k+1}$.
