Express your answer using standard set notation.", "solution": "The limit superior of a sequence of sets $\\{A_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$, denoted $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} A_n$, is the set of all points $x$ such that for any positive integer $N$, there exists an integer $n > N$ for which $x \\in A_n$. Equivalently, it is the set of all points that belong to infinitely many of the sets $A_n$. To find this set, we can examine which real numbers satisfy this condition by considering different cases.\n\nLet $L = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} A_n$. We will test points from various regions of the real line.\n\nCase 1: Test the point $x=0$.\nA point is in $L$ if it belongs to $A_n$ for infinitely many $n$. For $x=0$, we check both odd and even indices $n$.\n- If $n$ is odd, $A_n = [0, 1/n]$. Since $0$ is the left endpoint, $0 \\in A_n$ for all odd $n$. There are infinitely many odd positive integers ($1, 3, 5, \\dots$).\n- Therefore, $x=0$ belongs to infinitely many sets in the sequence $\\{A_n\\}$.\n- We conclude that $0 \\in L$.\n\nCase 2: Test the point $x=1$.\n- If $n$ is odd, $A_n = [0, 1/n]$. For $1$ to be in this set, we need $0 \\le 1 \\le 1/n$, which implies $n \\le 1$. So, among the odd-indexed sets, only $A_1$ contains the point $1$. This is a finite number of sets (just one).\n- If $n$ is even, $A_n = [1 - 1/n, 1]$. Since $1$ is the right endpoint, $1 \\in A_n$ for all even $n$. There are infinitely many even positive integers ($2, 4, 6, \\dots$).\n- Since $x=1$ belongs to infinitely many sets in the sequence, we conclude that $1 \\in L$.\n\nCase 3: Test a point $x$ in the open interval $(0, 1)$.\n- For $x$ to be in an odd-indexed set $A_n = [0, 1/n]$, we must have $x \\le 1/n$. This inequality can be rewritten as $n \\le 1/x$. Since $x$ is a fixed number in $(0, 1)$, $1/x$ is a fixed positive number. The set of positive integers $n$ satisfying $n \\le 1/x$ is finite. Thus, $x$ belongs to only a finite number of the odd-indexed sets.\n- For $x$ to be in an even-indexed set $A_n = [1 - 1/n, 1]$, we must have $1 - 1/n \\le x$. This inequality can be rewritten as $1 - x \\le 1/n$, or $n \\le 1/(1-x)$. Since $x \\in (0, 1)$, $1-x$ is also between $0$ and $1$, so $1/(1-x)$ is a fixed positive number. The set of positive integers $n$ satisfying $n \\le 1/(1-x)$ is finite. Thus, $x$ belongs to only a finite number of the even-indexed sets.\n- A point $x \\in (0,1)$ belongs to a finite number of odd-indexed sets and a finite number of even-indexed sets. Therefore, it belongs to a finite total number of sets in the sequence $\\{A_n\\}$.\n- We conclude that no point in $(0, 1)$ is in $L$.\n\nCase 4: Test a point $x  0$ or $x > 1$.\n- If $x  0$: The sets $A_n$ are either $[0, 1/n]$ or $[1-1/n, 1]$. For any $n \\ge 1$, the lower bound of $A_n$ is non-negative. Thus, $x  0$ cannot be in any set $A_n$.\n- If $x > 1$: The sets $A_n$ are either $[0, 1/n]$ or $[1-1/n, 1]$. For any $n \\ge 1$, the upper bound of $A_n$ is at most $1$. Thus, $x > 1$ cannot be in any set $A_n$. (More strictly, for $n>1$, $1/n1$, so $x>1$ is not in $A_n$ for odd $n>1$. And $A_1=[0,1]$ doesn't contain $x>1$. For even $n$, the upper bound is 1, so $x>1$ is not in $A_n$.)\n- In either subcase, $x$ belongs to zero sets, which is a finite number. Thus, no such point is in $L$.\n\nCombining all the cases, the only points that belong to infinitely many sets $A_n$ are $x=0$ and $x=1$.

First, we need to understand the structure of each set $A_n$. The defining inequality is $\\left(x - (-1)^n\\right)^2  \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$$ |x - (-1)^n|  1 + \\frac{1}{n} $$\nThis inequality describes an open interval centered at $(-1)^n$ with a radius of $1 + \\frac{1}{n}$.

This suggests we should analyze the subsequences of sets for even and odd values of $n$ separately.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is even.\nLet $n = 2k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.

As $K \\to \\infty$, $-2 - \\frac{1}{2K-1} \\to -2$ and $\\frac{1}{2K-1} \\to 0$. This implies that a point $x$ in the intersection must satisfy $-2 \\le x \\le 0$. The intersection is the closed interval $[-2, 0]$.\n\nFinally, we take the union of the two results:\n$$ \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} A_n = [0, 2] \\cup [-2, 0] = [-2, 2] $$\nThe limit superior of the sequence of sets is the closed interval from -2 to 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[-2, 2]}$$", "id": "1429084"}, {"introduction": "This final practice ventures into one of the most classic and thought-provoking examples in analysis: the Cantor set.
