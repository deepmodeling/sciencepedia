It is also closed under countable intersections. The closure under intersection follows from De Morgan's laws: for any two sets $S_1, S_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$, their complements $S_1^c, S_2^c$ are in $\\mathcal{A}$. Their union $S_1^c \\cup S_2^c$ is in $\\mathcal{A}$. The complement of this union, $(S_1^c \\cup S_2^c)^c = S_1 \\cap S_2$, must also be in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nUsing closure under intersection, we find the intersection of the two generating sets:\n$A \\cap B = \\{1, 2\\} \\cap \\{2, 3\\} = \\{2\\}$.\nThus, the singleton set $\\{2\\}$ must be in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nNow we can use the sets we've found to generate more sets. Since $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under intersections and complementation, it is also closed under set difference, as $S_1 \\setminus S_2 = S_1 \\cap S_2^c$.\nUsing this, we can isolate other singletons:\n- $\\{1\\} = A \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{1, 2\\} \\setminus \\{2\\}$. Since $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $\\{2\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$, we must have $\\{1\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $\\{3\\} = B \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{2, 3\\} \\setminus \\{2\\}$. Since $B \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $\\{2\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$, we must have $\\{3\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nWe have now established that the singletons $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, and $\\{3\\}$ are all members of $\\mathcal{A}$. To find the last singleton, $\\{4\\}$, we can use the union and complementation properties.\n- Since $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$, their finite union must also be in $\\mathcal{A}$ by property (3):\n  $\\{1\\} \\cup \\{2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- Now, using property (2), the complement of this set must be in $\\mathcal{A}$:\n  $(\\{1, 2, 3\\})^c = X \\setminus \\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{4\\}$.\nTherefore, the singleton set $\\{4\\}$ must also be in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nWe have shown that the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{A} = \\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$ must contain all four singleton sets: $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}$.\n\nAny subset of $X$ can be written as a finite (and therefore countable) union of these singleton sets. For example, the set $\\{1, 3\\}$ can be written as $\\{1\\} \\cup \\{3\\}$. Since $\\mathcal{A}$ contains all singletons and is closed under countable unions, it must contain all possible unions of these singletons.\nThe collection of all possible unions of these singletons is precisely the power set of $X$, denoted $\\mathcal{P}(X)$. The power set is the set of all subsets of $X$.\n\nTherefore, the generated $\\sigma$-algebra is the entire power set of $X$:\n$\\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) = \\mathcal{P}(X)$.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of sets in $\\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$. This is the cardinality of the power set of $X$. For a finite set with $n$ elements, the cardinality of its power set is $2^n$.\nIn our case, the set $X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ has $n=4$ elements.\nThe number of sets in $\\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$ is therefore $2^4$.\n\n$2^4 = 16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "1443697"}, {"introduction": "While the intersection of any family of $\\sigma$-algebras is always a $\\sigma$-algebra, the same is not true for their union.
