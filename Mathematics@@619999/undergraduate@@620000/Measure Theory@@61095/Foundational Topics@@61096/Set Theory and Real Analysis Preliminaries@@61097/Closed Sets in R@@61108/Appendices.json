Since $0 \\in S$ and $S \\subset [0,2]$, any open ball around $0$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is of the form $(-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)$ for some $\\varepsilon > 0$, and this interval contains negative numbers, none of which belong to $S$. Hence no open neighborhood of $0$ is contained in $S$, so $0$ is not an interior point of $S$. Therefore $S$ is not open.\n\nNext, we show $S$ is closed by proving that it contains all its limit points. Let $x$ be a limit point of $S$. By definition, there exists a sequence $(x_{k})$ with $x_{k} \\in S \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and $x_{k} \\to x$. Each term $x_{k}$ is either $0$ or of the form $1/n_{k} + 1/m_{k}$ with $n_{k}, m_{k} \\in \\mathbb{N}$. As $S \\subset [0,2]$, we have $x \\in [0,2]$.\n\nIf $\\min\\{n_{k}, m_{k}\\} \\to \\infty$, then $x_{k} \\to 0$, so $x = 0$. Otherwise, along a subsequence we may assume without loss of generality that $n_{k}$ is bounded. Passing to a further subsequence, assume $n_{k} \\equiv n$ is constant. If $(m_{k})$ were also bounded, then $\\{1/n + 1/m_{k}\\}$ would take values in a finite set, and a convergent sequence taking finitely many values must eventually be constant. Since $x_{k} \\neq x$ for all $k$, this cannot converge to $x$, a contradiction. Therefore $m_{k} \\to \\infty$, which implies $1/m_{k} \\to 0$ and hence $x_{k} = 1/n + 1/m_{k} \\to 1/n$. Thus $x = 1/n$.\n\nWe have shown that every limit point $x$ of $S$ lies in $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1/n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.
