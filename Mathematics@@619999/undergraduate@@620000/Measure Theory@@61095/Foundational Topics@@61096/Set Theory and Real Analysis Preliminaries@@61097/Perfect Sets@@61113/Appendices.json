By definition, a set is closed if it contains all its limit points. Let's find the set of all limit points of $\\mathbb{Z}$, denoted as $\\mathbb{Z}'$. We need to test whether any real number $x$ can be a limit point of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nCase 1: Let $x$ be an integer, so $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. To check if $x$ is a limit point, we must verify that *every* open interval containing $x$ also contains another point from $\\mathbb{Z}$. Let's consider the specific open interval $I = (x - 0.5, x + 0.5)$. This interval clearly contains $x$. However, the only integer within this interval is $x$ itself. The nearest integers are $x-1$ and $x+1$, which are outside of $I$. Since we have found an open interval containing $x$ that does not contain any other point of $\\mathbb{Z}$, $x$ is not a limit point of $\\mathbb{Z}$. This holds for any integer $x$.\n\nCase 2: Let $x$ be a real number that is not an integer, so $x \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $x$ must lie strictly between two consecutive integers, say $n$ and $n+1$ for some integer $n$. We have $n < x < n+1$. Let $\\delta$ be the smallest of the distances from $x$ to $n$ and to $n+1$. Formally, $\\delta = \\min(x-n, n+1-x)$. Since $x$ is not an integer, $\\delta > 0$. Now consider the open interval $J = (x - \\delta, x + \\delta)$. By construction, this interval is centered at $x$ and is narrow enough not to include $n$ or $n+1$. For instance, the upper bound of the interval is $x+\\delta \\le x + (n+1-x) = n+1$, and the lower bound is $x-\\delta \\ge x - (x-n) = n$. Since $x$ is strictly between $n$ and $n+1$, the interval $J$ is contained entirely within $(n, n+1)$ and therefore contains no integers. Thus, $x$ cannot be a limit point of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFrom both cases, we conclude that no real number is a limit point of $\\mathbb{Z}$. The set of limit points of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the empty set, $\\mathbb{Z}' = \\emptyset$. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points, which means we must check if $\\mathbb{Z}' \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\emptyset \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$ is a true statement for any set $\\mathbb{Z}$, the set of integers is indeed a closed set. This conclusion eliminates options C, D, and E.\n\nSecond, we determine if $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a perfect set. By definition, a set is perfect if it is closed and has no isolated points. We have already shown that $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed. Now we must check for isolated points.\n\nA point $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is an isolated point if there exists an open interval containing $p$ with no other points from $\\mathbb{Z}$. In our analysis for Case 1 above, we took an arbitrary integer $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and constructed the open interval $I = (x - 0.5, x + 0.5)$. We found that this interval contains $x$ but no other integer. This directly satisfies the definition of an isolated point. Since $x$ was an arbitrary integer, it means that every point in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an isolated point.\n\nA perfect set must have *no* isolated points. Since every point in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is isolated, $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not a perfect set.\n\nCombining our two findings: $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a closed set, but it is not a perfect set.
