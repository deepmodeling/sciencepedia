A key method to establish measurability is to analyze the structure of the pre-images of certain sets.\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a non-increasing function, meaning that for any $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, if $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) \\geq f(x_2)$.

Consequently, its reciprocal $g(x) = 1/f(x)$ is also strictly positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nIf $\\alpha$ is zero or negative ($\\alpha \\leq 0$), the inequality $g(x) > \\alpha$ is always true, because a positive number is always greater than a non-positive number.\nTherefore, for any $\\alpha \\leq 0$, the set $S_{\\alpha}$ includes all real numbers.\n$$ S_{\\alpha} = \\mathbb{R} = (-\\infty, \\infty) $$\nThe set $\\mathbb{R}$ is by definition an interval.\n\n**Case 2: $\\alpha > 0$**\n\nIn this case, both sides of the inequality $1/f(x) > \\alpha$ are positive. Since $f(x)$ is also positive, we can manipulate the inequality without changing its direction.\n$$ \\frac{1}{f(x)} > \\alpha \\iff 1 > \\alpha f(x) \\iff f(x) < \\frac{1}{\\alpha} $$\nSo, for $\\alpha > 0$, the set $S_{\\alpha}$ is equivalent to the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) < c\\}$, where $c = 1/\\alpha$ is a positive constant.\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of the set $S' = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) < c\\}$ given that $f$ is a non-increasing function.\n\nIf $S'$ is empty, it is considered an interval by convention.\nIf $S'$ is non-empty, let's pick an arbitrary element $x_0 \\in S'$. By definition, this means $f(x_0) < c$.\nSince $f$ is a non-increasing function, for any $x > x_0$, we must have $f(x) \\leq f(x_0)$.\nCombining these inequalities, we get $f(x) \\leq f(x_0) < c$. This implies that $f(x) < c$, so any such $x$ must also be in the set $S'$.\nIn other words, if the set $S'$ contains a point $x_0$, it must also contain the entire ray $(x_0, \\infty)$.\n\nThis property forces the set $S'$ to be a \"ray\" pointing towards positive infinity. To be more formal, let $a = \\inf S'$.\n- If the infimum $a$ is $-\\infty$, then $S'$ must be the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- If the infimum $a$ is a finite real number, then because $S'$ contains all points greater than any point within it, $S'$ must be of the form $(a, \\infty)$ or $[a, \\infty)$. The specific form depends on whether $f(a)$ is less than $c$ or equal to $c$ (or undefined).\nIn all these possibilities—$\\emptyset$, $\\mathbb{R}$, $(a, \\infty)$, $[a, \\infty)$—the set is an interval.\n\nCombining both cases, for any $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set $S_{\\alpha}$ is always an interval. This property is what makes monotone functions (and compositions like $g(x)$) measurable, as all intervals are measurable sets (specifically, Borel sets).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) $S_{\\alpha}$ is always an interval. This is consistent with our findings for both $\\alpha \\leq 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$.\nB) $S_{\\alpha}$ is always a finite union of disjoint open intervals. This is incorrect. For example, if $S_{\\alpha} = [1, \\infty)$ or $S_{\\alpha} = \\mathbb{R}$, it is not a union of disjoint *open* intervals.\nC) $S_{\\alpha}$ is always a compact set. This is incorrect. If $S_{\\alpha} = \\mathbb{R}$ or $S_{\\alpha} = (0, \\infty)$, it is not bounded and therefore not compact.\nD) $S_{\\alpha}$ is always a countable set. This is incorrect. Any non-empty interval, like $(0, 1)$, is an uncountable set.\nE) The structure of $S_{\\alpha}$ cannot be determined without knowing the specific form of $f(x)$. This is incorrect. The non-increasing property of $f$ is sufficient to determine that the set must be an interval.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is that $S_{\\alpha}$ is always an interval.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1430956"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the abstract properties of monotone functions is the first step; applying these properties to concrete computations solidifies that knowledge.
