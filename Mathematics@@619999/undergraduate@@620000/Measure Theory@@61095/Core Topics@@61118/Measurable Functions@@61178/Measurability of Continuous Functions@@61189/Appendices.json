This first practice grounds the abstract theory by asking you to compute the preimage of an open interval under the simple continuous function $f(x) = x^2$. By explicitly finding the set of all $x$ such that $f(x)$ is in a given range, you will directly verify that the preimage is a measurable set, in this case, a union of open intervals [@problem_id:1430497].", "problem": "Let the function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x) = x^2$.

By definition, the preimage $S = f^{-1}((1, 4))$ is the set of all points $x$ in the domain $\\mathbb{R}$ such that their image $f(x)$ lies in the codomain interval $(1, 4)$.\n\nWe can express this condition mathematically as:\n$$ S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\in (1, 4)\\} $$\n\nSubstituting the definition of the function, $f(x) = x^2$, we get:\n$$ S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 1 < x^2 < 4\\} $$\n\nThis compound inequality must be solved for $x$. We can split it into two separate inequalities that must hold simultaneously:\n1. $x^2 < 4$\n2. $x^2 > 1$\n\nLet's solve the first inequality, $x^2 < 4$. Taking the square root of both sides, we must consider the absolute value of $x$:\n$$ \\sqrt{x^2} < \\sqrt{4} $$\n$$ |x| < 2 $$\nThis inequality is equivalent to the open interval $(-2, 2)$. So, the solution to the first part is $x \\in (-2, 2)$.\n\nNext, let's solve the second inequality, $x^2 > 1$. Taking the square root of both sides:\n$$ \\sqrt{x^2} > \\sqrt{1} $$\n$$ |x| > 1 $$\nThis inequality holds true if $x > 1$ or if $x < -1$. This corresponds to the union of two disjoint open rays: $(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (1, \\infty)$.\n\nThe final set $S$ consists of all $x$ that satisfy both conditions. Therefore, we need to find the intersection of the solution sets for the two inequalities:\n$$ S = (-2, 2) \\cap \\left( (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (1, \\infty) \\right) $$\n\nWe can use the distributive property of set intersection over set union:\n$$ S = \\left( (-2, 2) \\cap (-\\infty, -1) \\right) \\cup \\left( (-2, 2) \\cap (1, \\infty) \\right) $$\n\nLet's evaluate each intersection separately:\n- The intersection of $(-2, 2)$ and $(-\\infty, -1)$ is the set of all numbers that are greater than $-2$ and less than $-1$. This is the open interval $(-2, -1)$.\n- The intersection of $(-2, 2)$ and $(1, \\infty)$ is the set of all numbers that are greater than $1$ and less than $2$. This is the open interval $(1, 2)$.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that the set $S$ is the union of these two intervals:\n$$ S = (-2, -1) \\cup (1, 2) $$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we see that it matches option D.\n\nThis exercise demonstrates a key concept in measure theory. A function is defined as measurable if the preimage of every measurable set is measurable. In the context of Borel sets on $\\mathbb{R}$, this is often simplified to checking if the preimage of any open interval is a measurable set. Here, the preimage $S$ is a union of two open intervals.

Choose a compact interval that contains $[x_{0},x_{0}+\\delta]$ and the nearby shifted intervals for small shifts; for instance, take $I=[x_{0}-1,x_{0}+\\delta+1]$.

Since $x_{0}$ was arbitrary, $g$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $g$ is Lebesgue measurable as well.\n\nNext, we show that $g$ need not be differentiable, so any claim of guaranteed differentiability is false. Consider\n$$\nf(t)=\\max\\{1-|t|,\\,0\\},\n$$\nwhich is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, and choose any $\\delta$ with $0<\\delta<1$.

Hence the maximum on $[x,x+\\delta]$ is attained at $t=x$, giving\n$$\ng(x)=1-x \\quad\\text{for }x\\in(0,\\delta].\n$$\nThus, near $x=0$, $g$ is equal to $1$ for $x\\le 0$ and to $1-x$ for $x>0$, so the left derivative at $0$ equals $0$ while the right derivative equals $-1$. Therefore, $g$ is not differentiable at $0$. This shows statements asserting differentiability of $g$ (and a fortiori continuity of $g'$) are false in general.\n\nFinally, since we have proved $g$ is continuous for every continuous $f$ and fixed $\\delta>0$, statement A is always true. Statement B is false because it claims that $g$ may fail to be continuous for some continuous $f$. Statement C is false because $g$ is continuous (hence measurable).
