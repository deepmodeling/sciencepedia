The problem describes a pre-measure $\\mu_0$ on an algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ and presents two distinct extensions, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, to the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$. This situation illustrates a key result in measure theory related to Carathéodory's extension theorem: the extension of a pre-measure is unique if and only if the pre-measure is $\\sigma$-finite.\n\nLet's quickly check why $\\mu_0$ is not $\\sigma$-finite. A pre-measure space $(X, \\mathcal{A}, \\mu_0)$ is $\\sigma$-finite if $X$ can be written as a countable union of sets from $\\mathcal{A}$, each having finite measure. Here, $X=\\mathbb{R}$. The sets in $\\mathcal{A}$ with finite $\\mu_0$-measure are precisely the finite subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Any countable union of such sets is a countable set. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, it cannot be covered by a countable union of sets from $\\mathcal{A}$ with finite measure. Thus, $\\mu_0$ is not $\\sigma$-finite, and the uniqueness of its extension is not guaranteed.\n\nBoth $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are valid extensions. For any finite set $F \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$, $F \\in \\mathcal{A}$, and we have $\\mu_1(F) = |F \\cap \\mathbb{Z}| = |F| = \\mu_0(F)$. Also, since $1/2 \\notin F$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\notin F$, we have $\\mu_2(F) = |F \\cap \\mathbb{Z}| + e \\cdot 0 + \\pi \\cdot 0 = |F| = \\mu_0(F)$. For a set $A = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus F$ with $F \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ finite, $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mu_0(A)=\\infty$. We have $\\mu_1(A) = |(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus F) \\cap \\mathbb{Z}| = |\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus F| = \\infty$. And since $1/2 \\in A$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\in A$, $\\mu_2(A) = |A \\cap \\mathbb{Z}| + e \\cdot 1 + \\pi \\cdot 1 = \\infty + e + \\pi = \\infty$.

For the upper bound, $\\sqrt{4} < \\sqrt{8} < \\sqrt{9}$, so $2 < \\sqrt{8} < 3$. More precisely, $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2 \\times 1.414 = 2.828$.\nThe integers $n$ such that $-0.5 \\le n \\le 2.828$ are $0, 1, 2$.\nSo, the set of integers in $S$ is $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe cardinality is $|S \\cap \\mathbb{Z}| = 3$.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the second term, $e \\cdot \\delta_{1/2}(S)$.\nThe Dirac measure $\\delta_{1/2}(S)$ is 1 if $1/2 \\in S$ and 0 otherwise.\nThe interval is $S = [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\sqrt{8}] = [-0.5, \\approx 2.828]$.\nSince $-0.5 \\le 0.5 \\le 2.828$, the point $1/2$ is in the interval $S$.\nTherefore, $\\delta_{1/2}(S) = 1$.\nThe second term is $e \\cdot 1 = e$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the third term, $\\pi \\cdot \\delta_{\\sqrt{3}}(S)$.\nThe Dirac measure $\\delta_{\\sqrt{3}}(S)$ is 1 if $\\sqrt{3} \\in S$ and 0 otherwise.\nWe know that $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$.\nThe interval is $S = [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\sqrt{8}] = [-0.5, \\approx 2.828]$.\nSince $-0.5 \\le 1.732 \\le 2.828$, the point $\\sqrt{3}$ is in the interval $S$.\nTherefore, $\\delta_{\\sqrt{3}}(S) = 1$.\nThe third term is $\\pi \\cdot 1 = \\pi$.\n\nStep 4: Sum the components.\nNow we sum the three parts to find $\\mu_2(S)$:\n$$ \\mu_2([-\\frac{1}{2}, \\sqrt{8}]) = |S \\cap \\mathbb{Z}| + e \\cdot \\delta_{1/2}(S) + \\pi \\cdot \\delta_{\\sqrt{3}}(S) = 3 + e + \\pi $$\nThe final result is the analytic expression $3 + e + \\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3 + e + \\pi}$$", "id": "1407805"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to build a measure and when its extension is unique, we now probe the limits of the resulting framework.

In particular, the resulting measure $\\mu$ on measurable sets is translation invariant with respect to the group operation $\\oplus$.\n\nWe first justify translation invariance for the outer measure. Let $A \\subseteq X$ and $t \\in X$. By definition of $\\mu^{*}$, for any $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists a countable family $\\{I_{k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of half-open intervals in $X$ with $A \\subseteq \\bigcup_{k} I_{k}$ and $\\sum_{k} \\mu_{0}(I_{k}) \\le \\mu^{*}(A)+\\varepsilon$.

To prove disjointness, suppose $(V \\oplus d_{1}) \\cap (V \\oplus d_{2}) \\neq \\varnothing$. Then there exist $v_{1}, v_{2} \\in V$ such that $v_{1} \\oplus d_{1} = v_{2} \\oplus d_{2}$. Thus $(v_{1}-v_{2}) \\bmod 1 = d_{2}-d_{1} \\in D$, so $v_{1} \\sim v_{2}$. Since $V$ contains exactly one representative from each class, we must have $v_{1}=v_{2}$, hence $d_{1}=d_{2}$. Therefore the sets are pairwise disjoint.\n\nTo see the union is all of $X$, let $x \\in X$. By definition of the equivalence classes, there exists $v \\in V$ and $d \\in D$ such that $x \\sim v$ and $x = v \\oplus d$. Hence $x \\in V \\oplus d$.
