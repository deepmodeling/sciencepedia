Since $[0] = \\mathbb{Q}$ (because $x \\sim 0$ iff $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$), all rationals lie in the single class $\\mathbb{Q}$. As $V$ contains exactly one element from each class, there is exactly one element of $V$ in $[0] = \\mathbb{Q}$. Hence $|V \\cap \\mathbb{Q}| = 1$, so A is true.\n\nB. Suppose for contradiction that there exists $(a,b) \\subseteq V$ with $a < b$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, choose $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $0 < q < b - a$. Pick any $y \\in (a, b - q)$ and set $x = y + q \\in (a,b)$. Then $x - y = q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, so $x \\sim y$.

Since $V$ contains at most one representative from each class, it follows $v = w$, which forces $q = 0$, a contradiction. Hence $V \\neq V + q$ for every non-zero rational $q$, so C is false.\n\nD. Every equivalence class intersects $[0,1)$, since for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ there exists $n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}$ with $x - n \\in [0,1)$. Thus one can construct a selector contained in $[0,1)$. However, such containment is not necessary: if $V \\subset [0,1)$ is a selector, then $V + 2$ is also a selector (translation by any real maps classes bijectively) and $V + 2 \\subset [2,3)$, hence not contained in $[0,1)$. Therefore it is not necessary that $V \\subset [0,1)$, so D is false.\n\nE. If $x,y \\in V$ are distinct, then $x - y \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$ by the defining property of $V$.
