Pinpointing the breakdown in the logic will solidify your grasp of the crucial role that the countability of the rationals plays in the original proof.", "problem": "The standard construction of a non-measurable set, known as a Vitali set, is a cornerstone of measure theory. It begins by defining an equivalence relation on the interval $[0, 1)$. Two numbers $x, y \\in [0, 1)$ are considered equivalent, denoted $x \\sim y$, if their difference $x - y$ is a rational number. The interval $[0, 1)$ is thus partitioned into disjoint equivalence classes. The Axiom of Choice is then invoked to create a new set, $V$, by selecting exactly one representative element from each of these equivalence classes. Through a proof by contradiction involving translations of $V$ by rational numbers, this set $V$ is shown to be non-measurable with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\n\nNow, consider a modified procedure applied to the entire set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. We define a new equivalence relation, $\\approx$, on $\\mathbb{R}$ where for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have $x \\approx y$ if and only if their difference $x-y$ is a real number. We then attempt to follow the logic of the Vitali argument, using this new relation, to construct a non-measurable set by forming a set of representatives.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental reason why this modified procedure fails to produce a non-measurable set?\n\nA. The Axiom of Choice cannot be applied because the collection of equivalence classes generated by $\\approx$ is uncountable.\n\nB. The resulting representative set is uncountable, and its Lebesgue measure cannot be determined.\n\nC. The relation $\\approx$ is not a valid equivalence relation because it is not transitive.\n\nD. The partition of $\\mathbb{R}$ under the relation $\\approx$ consists of only a single equivalence class, which forces the representative set to be a singleton, a set which is known to be measurable.\n\nE. The union of the translated copies of the representative set does not cover the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nF. The translated copies of the representative set are not disjoint, which invalidates the use of the additivity property of measure.", "solution": "We define the modified relation on $\\mathbb{R}$ by $x \\approx y$ if and only if $x-y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For any $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the difference $x-y$ is always a real number, so for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ we have $x \\approx y$. First, verify that $\\approx$ is an equivalence relation:\n- Reflexive: For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $x-x=0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, hence $x \\approx x$.\n- Symmetric: If $x \\approx y$, then $x-y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so $y-x=-(x-y) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, hence $y \\approx x$.\n- Transitive: If $x \\approx y$ and $y \\approx z$, then $x-y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $y-z \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so $x-z=(x-y)+(y-z) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, hence $x \\approx z$.\n\nTherefore, $\\approx$ is an equivalence relation. Since $x \\approx y$ holds for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there is only one equivalence class, namely $\\mathbb{R}$ itself. The partition of $\\mathbb{R}$ induced by $\\approx$ is thus the single class $\\{\\mathbb{R}\\}$. Applying the Axiom of Choice to pick one representative from each class yields a representative set consisting of exactly one element, say $V=\\{v\\}$.\n\nThis $V$ is a singleton, and singletons are Lebesgue measurable with measure zero. Hence the Vitali-style argument to produce a non-measurable set fails at the foundational level: the quotient by $\\approx$ is trivial, forcing the representative set to be a singleton. The failure is not due to any issue with the Axiom of Choice, the size of the representative set, the validity of the equivalence relation, coverage by translations, or disjointness of translates, but precisely because the partition under $\\approx$ has only one class, making the representative set measurable.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the partition under $\\approx$ consists of a single equivalence class, forcing the representative set to be a singleton, which is measurable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1418199"}, {"introduction": "While we've established that Vitali sets are non-measurable, we can still probe their properties using the concepts of inner and outer measure.
