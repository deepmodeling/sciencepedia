We will investigate the \"size\" of the set of irrational numbers within the unit interval, contrasting the set's uncountably infinite nature with its Lebesgue measure.

We use the following properties, with explicit justifications as needed.\n\n1) Compute $\\lambda^{*}([0,1])$.\n- Upper bound: Since $[0,1]$ is covered by the single open interval $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})$ (or by $(0,1)$ with an arbitrarily small enlargement), we have $\\lambda^{*}([0,1]) \\le 1$ because we can cover $[0,1]$ by itself as a closed interval with length $1$ in the defining infimum over coverings by intervals. Concretely, by the definition of outer measure as an infimum of sums of lengths of countable coverings by open intervals, taking a sequence of open intervals contracting to $[0,1]$ shows $\\lambda^{*}([0,1]) \\le 1$.\n- Lower bound: Let $\\{I_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be any countable cover of $[0,1]$ by open intervals. By compactness of $[0,1]$ (Heine–Borel), there exists a finite subcover $\\{I_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{n}$. The union $\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} I_{k}$ is a finite union of intervals; merging overlaps yields a finite disjoint union $\\bigcup_{j=1}^{m} J_{j}$ of open intervals with $\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} I_{k}=\\bigcup_{j=1}^{m} J_{j}$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^{m} |J_{j}| \\le \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |I_{k}|$, where $|(\\alpha,\\beta)|=\\beta-\\alpha$ denotes interval length. Since $[0,1]\\subset \\bigcup_{j=1}^{m} J_{j}$, we have\n$$\n1 \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{m} |J_{j}| \\le \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |I_{k}|.\n$$\nBecause this holds for every finite subcover and every cover, taking the infimum over all coverings gives $\\lambda^{*}([0,1]) \\ge 1$. Combining with the upper bound, $\\lambda^{*}([0,1])=1$.\n\n2) Show $\\lambda^{*}(\\{x\\})=0$ for any $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$.

Hence $\\lambda^{*}(\\{x\\}) \\le \\varepsilon$ for all $\\varepsilon > 0$, so $\\lambda^{*}(\\{x\\})=0$.\n\n3) Show $\\lambda^{*}(\\mathbb{Q}\\cap[0,1])=0$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}\\cap[0,1]$ is countable, write $\\mathbb{Q}\\cap[0,1]=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\{q_{n}\\}$.
