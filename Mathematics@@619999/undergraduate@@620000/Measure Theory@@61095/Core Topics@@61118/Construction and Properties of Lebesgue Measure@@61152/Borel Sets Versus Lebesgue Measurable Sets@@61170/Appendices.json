The Vitali set**\nA key property of the Vitali set is that it is not Lebesgue measurable. A fundamental theorem in measure theory states that every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable. Since the Vitali set is not Lebesgue measurable, it cannot be a Borel set. Therefore, option A is not a Borel set.\n\n**B. The set of all rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$**\nThe set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set. We can enumerate its elements as $\\mathbb{Q} = \\{q_1, q_2, q_3, \\dots\\}$. Each individual element forms a singleton set $\\{q_n\\}$. In the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}$, any finite set is a closed set, so each singleton $\\{q_n\\}$ is a closed set. The complement of a closed set is an open set. Since $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ contains all open sets and is closed under complements, it must contain all closed sets. Thus, each singleton $\\{q_n\\}$ is a Borel set. The set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the countable union of these singleton sets:\n$$\n\\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n\\}\n$$\nSince a $\\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable unions, and each $\\{q_n\\}$ is a Borel set, their countable union $\\mathbb{Q}$ is also a Borel set. Sets that can be written as a countable union of closed sets are also known as $F_{\\sigma}$ sets. All $F_{\\sigma}$ sets are Borel sets. Therefore, option B is a Borel set.\n\n**C. The standard Cantor ternary set, $C$**\nThe Cantor set can be constructed iteratively. Let $C_0 = [0, 1]$. Let $C_1 = [0, 1/3] \\cup [2/3, 1]$ be the set obtained by removing the middle third from $C_0$. Let $C_n$ be the set obtained by removing the open middle third from each interval in $C_{n-1}$. Each $C_n$ is a finite union of disjoint closed intervals. A finite union of closed sets is a closed set. Thus, each $C_n$ is a closed set.\nThe Cantor set is defined as the intersection of all these sets:\n$$\nC = \\bigcap_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n\n$$\nAs established previously, all closed sets are Borel sets, so each $C_n$ is a Borel set. The Borel $\\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable intersections. Therefore, $C$, being a countable intersection of Borel sets, is itself a Borel set. Alternatively, one can show that $C$ is a closed set (it is bounded and contains all of its limit points), and since all closed sets are Borel sets, $C$ is a Borel set. Therefore, option C is a Borel set.\n\n**D. The set of all irrational numbers, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$**\nThe set of irrational numbers is the complement of the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. We can write this as $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$. The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is itself an open set, and therefore a Borel set. In part B, we established that $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Borel set. The Borel $\\sigma$-algebra is closed under set complementation (and set difference, since $A \\setminus B = A \\cap B^c$). Thus, the set $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ is the complement of a Borel set, which must also be a Borel set. Therefore, option D is a Borel set.\n\n**E. The Minkowski sum $C+C$**\nThis set is the sum of two Cantor sets. It is a well-known result in analysis that the Minkowski sum of the standard Cantor set with itself covers the entire continuous interval $[0, 2]$. That is, $C+C = [0, 2]$. The set $[0, 2]$ is a closed interval on the real line. Any closed interval is a closed set in the standard topology of $\\mathbb{R}$. As all closed sets are Borel sets, the interval $[0, 2]$ is a Borel set.
