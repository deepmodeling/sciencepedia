The set of irrational numbers is $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$. So, the set of irrational numbers in $[0, 1]$ is $[0, 1] \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q})$, which can be written as $[0, 1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$. The set of rational numbers in $[0, 2]$ is $[0, 2] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the set $S$ is given by:\n$$S = ([0, 1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}) \\cup ([0, 2] \\cap \\mathbb{Q})$$\n\nTo find the outer measure $m^*(S)$, we will establish both a lower and an upper bound for it.\n\n**Step 1: Establishing a lower bound for $m^*(S)$**\n\nWe will use the monotonicity property of the Lebesgue outer measure, which states that if $A \\subseteq B$, then $m^*(A) \\le m^*(B)$.

Since $S = ([0, 1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}) \\cup ([0, 2] \\cap \\mathbb{Q})$, it follows that $x \\in S$.\n\nCase 2: $x$ is rational.\nIf $x$ is rational and $x \\in [0, 1]$, then $x \\in [0, 1] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$. Since the interval $[0, 1]$ is a subset of the interval $[0, 2]$, we have $[0, 1] \\cap \\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq [0, 2] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $x \\in [0, 2] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$.

The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. Any subset of a countable set is also countable. Therefore, the set $[0, 2] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. The Lebesgue outer measure of any countable set is $0$. So, $m^*([0, 2] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\nNext, consider $m^*([0, 1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q})$. The set $[0, 1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ is a subset of $[0, 1]$.
