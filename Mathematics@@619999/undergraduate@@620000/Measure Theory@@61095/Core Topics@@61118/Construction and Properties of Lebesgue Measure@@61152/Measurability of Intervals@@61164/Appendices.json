A key step in proving this is to show that any open interval $(a, b)$, where $a < b$ are real numbers, is a measurable set. This is fundamentally demonstrated by representing the open interval as a countable union of closed intervals, since closed intervals are known to be measurable and a sigma-algebra is closed under countable unions.\n\nConsider a general open interval $(a, b)$.

Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThe set is $S_A = \\bigcup_{n=N}^{\\infty} \\left[a + \\frac{1}{n}, b - \\frac{1}{n}\\right]$, where the integer $N$ is chosen such that $N > \\frac{2}{b-a}$.\nFirst, let's verify that the intervals are well-defined and are subsets of $(a,b)$. The condition $N > \\frac{2}{b-a}$ implies $\\frac{1}{N} < \\frac{b-a}{2}$. For any $n \\ge N$, we have $\\frac{1}{n} \\le \\frac{1}{N}$, so $\\frac{1}{n} < \\frac{b-a}{2}$. This means $a + \\frac{1}{n} < a + \\frac{b-a}{2} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$ and $b - \\frac{1}{n} > b - \\frac{b-a}{2} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Combining these, we get $a + \\frac{1}{n} < b - \\frac{1}{n}$, so the interval $\\left[a + \\frac{1}{n}, b - \\frac{1}{n}\\right]$ is non-empty. Since $n$ is a positive integer, $a + \\frac{1}{n} > a$ and $b - \\frac{1}{n} < b$. Thus, for every $n \\ge N$, the closed interval $\\left[a + \\frac{1}{n}, b - \\frac{1}{n}\\right]$ is a subset of the open interval $(a, b)$. Consequently, their union $S_A$ must be a subset of $(a, b)$.\n\nNext, we must show that any element of $(a, b)$ is also an element of $S_A$. Let $x \\in (a, b)$. This means $a < x < b$. Let $\\delta = \\min(x-a, b-x)$. Since $x$ is strictly between $a$ and $b$, $\\delta > 0$. We need to find an integer $n \\ge N$ such that $x$ is in the interval $\\left[a + \\frac{1}{n}, b - \\frac{1}{n}\\right]$. This is equivalent to the conditions $a + \\frac{1}{n} \\le x$ and $x \\le b - \\frac{1}{n}$. These inequalities can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{n} \\le x-a$ and $\\frac{1}{n} \\le b-x$. Both are satisfied if $\\frac{1}{n} \\le \\min(x-a, b-x) = \\delta$, which is equivalent to $n \\ge \\frac{1}{\\delta}$. Since we can always find an integer $n$ such that $n \\ge \\frac{1}{\\delta}$ and also $n \\ge N$, we can conclude that $x \\in S_A$.\n\nSince $S_A \\subseteq (a,b)$ and $(a,b) \\subseteq S_A$, we have $S_A = (a,b)$. This option correctly represents $(a,b)$ as a countable union of closed intervals.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe set is $S_B = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[a, b + \\frac{1}{n}\\right]$. This is a countable intersection, not a union. Let's find what set this represents. A point $x$ is in $S_B$ if and only if $x \\in \\left[a, b + \\frac{1}{n}\\right]$ for all integers $n \\ge 1$. This means two conditions must hold for all $n$: $x \\ge a$ and $x \\le b + \\frac{1}{n}$. The first condition, $x \\ge a$, is independent of $n$. The second condition, $x \\le b + \\frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \\ge 1$, implies that $x$ must be less than or equal to the limit of $b + \\frac{1}{n}$ as $n \\to \\infty$, which is $b$. So, we must have $x \\le b$. Combining the conditions, $x$ must satisfy $a \\le x \\le b$. Therefore, $S_B$ is the closed interval $[a,b]$, not the open interval $(a,b)$.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe set is $S_C = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(a + \\frac{1}{n}, b - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)$. While this expression does correctly evaluate to the open interval $(a,b)$, it is a union of *open* intervals. The entire purpose of this construction in measure theory is to build more complex sets (like open intervals) from simpler sets whose measurability is already established (like *closed* intervals). This option does not accomplish that goal.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThe set is $S_D = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{M} \\left[a + \\frac{1}{n}, b - \\frac{1}{n}\\right]$, for a fixed large integer $M$. This is a *finite* union of closed sets. A finite union of closed sets is itself a closed set. Assuming $M$ is large enough such that the intervals are well-defined, the intervals in the union are nested. The union is equal to the largest interval in the collection, which is $\\left[a + \\frac{1}{M}, b - \\frac{1}{M}\\right]$. This is a closed interval and is a proper subset of $(a, b)$. For example, the point $a + \\frac{1}{M+1}$ is in $(a, b)$ but it is not in $\\left[a + \\frac{1}{M}, b - \\frac{1}{M}\\right]$. Therefore, $S_D \\neq (a, b)$. This option also fails because the union is not countable (in the infinite sense), which is a requirement for the properties of a sigma-algebra to apply in this context.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option A correctly represents the open interval $(a, b)$ as a countable union of closed intervals for the purpose of demonstrating its measurability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1306608"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand that intervals and their unions are measurable, we can move from questions of structure to questions of size.
