So B is incorrect.\n\nC. This describes an **ideal** of sets. It requires closure under *finite* unions, which is a weaker condition than closure under *countable* unions, derived from the sub-additivity axiom.

So C is incomplete and thus incorrect.\n\nD. This option correctly lists all three derived properties: $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{F}$, closure under countable unions, and closure under taking subsets. This accurately describes a $\\sigma$-ideal. This is the correct set of necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nE. This describes a set system closed under countable unions and intersections (a $\\sigma$-lattice). It is missing the crucial condition of being closed under taking subsets (hereditary property).
