We must verify the Carathéodory criterion for any test set $A \\subseteq X$.\n*   **Subcase 1.1: $A$ is countable.**\n    If $A$ is countable, then $\\mu^*(A) = 0$. The sets $A \\cap E$ and $A \\cap E^c$ are both subsets of the countable set $A$, so they are also countable. Therefore, $\\mu^*(A \\cap E) = 0$ and $\\mu^*(A \\cap E^c) = 0$. The criterion becomes $0 = 0 + 0$, which is true.\n*   **Subcase 1.2: $A$ is uncountable.**\n    If $A$ is uncountable, then $\\mu^*(A) = 1$. The set $A \\cap E$ is a subset of the countable set $E$, so $A \\cap E$ is countable. This means $\\mu^*(A \\cap E) = 0$. Now consider the set $A \\cap E^c = A \\setminus E$. Since $A$ is uncountable and $E$ is countable, their difference $A \\setminus E$ must be uncountable. (If $A \\setminus E$ were countable, then $A = (A \\setminus E) \\cup E$ would be a union of two countable sets, which would imply $A$ is countable, a contradiction). Thus, $A \\cap E^c$ is uncountable, and $\\mu^*(A \\cap E^c) = 1$. The criterion becomes $1 = 0 + 1$, which is true.\n\nSince the criterion holds for both countable and uncountable test sets $A$, any countable set $E$ is measurable.\n\n**Case 2: The complement of $E$, $E^c$, is a countable set.**\nLet $E^c$ be a countable subset of $X$. We must verify the Carathéodory criterion for any test set $A \\subseteq X$.\n*   **Subcase 2.1: $A$ is countable.**\n    As in Subcase 1.1, $\\mu^*(A) = 0$, and $\\mu^*(A \\cap E) = 0$, $\\mu^*(A \\cap E^c) = 0$. The criterion $0 = 0 + 0$ holds.\n*   **Subcase 2.2: $A$ is uncountable.**\n    If $A$ is uncountable, then $\\mu^*(A) = 1$. The set $A \\cap E^c$ is a subset of the countable set $E^c$, so $A \\cap E^c$ is countable. This means $\\mu^*(A \\cap E^c) = 0$. Now consider the set $A \\cap E = A \\setminus E^c$. Since $A$ is uncountable and $E^c$ is countable, their difference $A \\setminus E^c$ must be uncountable. Thus, $A \\cap E$ is uncountable, and $\\mu^*(A \\cap E) = 1$. The criterion becomes $1 = 1 + 0$, which is true.\n\nSince the criterion holds for all test sets $A$, any set $E$ with a countable complement is measurable.\nCombining Case 1 and Case 2, we have shown that every set in $\\mathcal{S}$ is measurable, so $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}$.\n\n**Part 2: Show that any measurable set must be in $\\mathcal{S}$ ($\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$).**\n\nWe will prove this by contradiction. Assume there exists a measurable set $E \\in \\mathcal{M}$ such that $E \\notin \\mathcal{S}$. By the definition of $\\mathcal{S}$, this means that $E$ is not countable and its complement $E^c$ is also not countable. In other words, both $E$ and $E^c$ are uncountable sets.\n\nSince $E$ is assumed to be measurable, it must satisfy the Carathéodory criterion for *all* test sets $A \\subseteq X$. Let's choose the test set $A = X$. Since $X$ is given as an uncountable set, we have $\\mu^*(X) = 1$.\n\nThe Carathéodory criterion for $A=X$ is:\n$$\n\\mu^*(X) = \\mu^*(X \\cap E) + \\mu^*(X \\cap E^c)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mu^*(X) = \\mu^*(E) + \\mu^*(E^c)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the values of the outer measure based on our assumptions:\n*   $\\mu^*(X) = 1$, since $X$ is uncountable.\n*   $\\mu^*(E) = 1$, since we assumed $E$ is uncountable.\n*   $\\mu^*(E^c) = 1$, since we assumed $E^c$ is uncountable.\n\nPlugging these values into the criterion gives:\n$$\n1 = 1 + 1\n$$\n$$\n1 = 2\n$$\nThis is a clear contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. There cannot exist a measurable set $E$ for which both $E$ and $E^c$ are uncountable. This means that if a set $E$ is measurable, it must be the case that either $E$ is countable or $E^c$ is countable. So, $E \\in \\mathcal{S}$. This proves that $\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom Part 1 ($\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}$) and Part 2 ($\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$), we conclude that $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathcal{S}$. The $\\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets is precisely the collection of all subsets of $X$ that are either countable or have a countable complement.
