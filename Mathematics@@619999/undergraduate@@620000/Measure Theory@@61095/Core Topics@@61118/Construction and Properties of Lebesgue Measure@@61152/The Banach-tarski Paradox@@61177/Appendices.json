Mastering this distinction is the first step toward appreciating the paradox's true mathematical substance.", "problem": "The Banach-Tarski paradox is a famous theorem in set theory that demonstrates a counter-intuitive property of three-dimensional Euclidean space. The theorem states that a solid ball can be decomposed into a finite number of disjoint point sets, which can then be reassembled to form two solid balls, each identical in size to the original. This reassembly is accomplished purely through rigid motions, meaning the pieces are only translated and rotated, not stretched, bent, or otherwise deformed. Two sets are said to be \"congruent\" if one can be transformed into the other by a rigid motion (an isometry).\n\nBased on this description of the paradox, which of the following statements is a logically correct conclusion?\n\nA. The original ball contains at least one proper subset (a subset that is not the entire ball) that is congruent to the original ball.\n\nB.

Here, two sets $A$ and $C$ are congruent if there exists an isometry $g$ with $g(A)=C$.\n\nWe analyze each option:\n\nA. Claim: There exists a proper subset $S \\subsetneq B$ that is congruent to $B$. If $S$ were congruent to $B$, then there exists an isometry $g$ with $g(B)=S$. Since any isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ maps a ball to a ball of the same radius, $g(B)$ is a ball of the same radius as $B$. If $g(B) \\subseteq B$ and both have the same radius, then necessarily $g(B)=B$ (a ball of radius $r$ cannot be a proper subset of another ball of radius $r$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$). Hence $S$ cannot be a proper subset. Therefore A is false.\n\nB. Claim: $B$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets, each congruent to $B$. If $B=S_{1} \\sqcup S_{2}$ with each $S_{i}$ congruent to $B$, then there exist isometries $g_{i}$ with $g_{i}(B)=S_{i}$. Thus each $S_{i}$ is itself a ball of the same radius as $B$, disjoint and contained in $B$. This is impossible because two disjoint balls of radius equal to that of $B$ cannot both be contained in $B$. Therefore B is false.\n\nC. Claim: $B$ can be partitioned into finitely many disjoint pieces that can be sorted into two collections; neither collection, as a subset of $B$, is congruent to $B$, but each collection can be reassembled via rigid motions to form a ball congruent to $B$. This is precisely what the Banach-Tarski paradox asserts: there exist pieces $P_{1},\\dots,P_{n}$ and isometries so that the pieces can be rigidly moved and grouped to produce two copies of a ball congruent to $B$. The statement explicitly does not require that either collection, before reassembly, be congruent to $B$ as a subset of $B$. Therefore C correctly captures the theorem’s conclusion.\n\nD. Claim: The paradox is invalid for physical objects because it requires decomposing the ball into pieces that all have zero volume. The theorem is a result in set theory and geometric group theory, not a claim about physical feasibility. Moreover, the pieces are non-measurable (not all of zero Lebesgue measure in any well-defined sense); asserting they all have zero volume is inaccurate.

A key part of the standard construction involves a set of rotations about axes passing through the center of the ball, which we denote as the origin $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nA conceptual issue arises: the origin $\\mathcal{O}$ is a fixed point for all these rotations. If $\\mathcal{O}$ belongs to a piece $A_k$ of the partition, any rotation applied to $A_k$ will leave $\\mathcal{O}$ in its original position. This seems to imply that the origin cannot be duplicated to appear in the center of both new balls.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct resolution to this apparent contradiction?\n\nA. The decomposition is applied not to the entire ball $B$, but to the ball with a countable set of \"problematic\" points removed, $B \\setminus P$, where $P$ contains the origin and all other fixed points of the rotation group. This yields two copies of $B \\setminus P$. The countable set $P$ is then handled separately using a procedure analogous to the Hilbert's Hotel paradox, allowing the original points from $P$ to be rearranged to fill the holes in both new balls.\n\nB. The pieces of the decomposition are non-measurable, and as such, they do not have a well-defined volume. This property also implies that a single point within them, like the origin, does not have a well-defined position, allowing it to be mapped to multiple locations simultaneously.\n\nC. The Axiom of Choice, which is necessary for the paradox, allows for the creation of sets with properties that violate classical geometry. One such property is that the piece containing the origin can be mapped by a single rigid motion onto a new set that contains two points corresponding to the centers of the new balls.\n\nD. In the context of the abstract group theory used to prove the paradox, the \"rotations\" are symbolic isometries that do not necessarily correspond to physical rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The concept of a fixed \"origin\" is a simplification that does not hold in the formal proof.\n\nE. The origin is a set of measure zero and is therefore discarded before the decomposition.

Radially extending these sets yields a paradoxical decomposition of $B\\setminus P$ into finitely many pieces which, under finitely many rigid motions (rotations about the origin), produce two copies of $B\\setminus P$.\n\nThis directly resolves the “fixed origin” issue during the main construction, because the origin $0\\in P$ is removed and hence never needs to be moved by any rotation.\n\nIt remains to restore the countable set $P$ to obtain two exact copies of the full ball $B$.

The minimum number of pieces required for this decomposition of $S^2$ is five. The proof traditionally hinges on the properties of the free group on two generators, $F_2 = \\langle a, b \\rangle$, which can be made to act on the sphere via a group of rotations.\n\nA crucial step in the proof involves partitioning the group $F_2$ itself. The standard partition divides $F_2$ into five disjoint sets: $\\{e\\}$, $S(a)$, $S(a^{-1})$, $S(b)$, and $S(b^{-1})$, where $e$ is the identity element, and $S(x)$ is the set of all non-identity reduced words in $F_2$ that start with the generator $x$ or its inverse.\n\nConsider a hypothetical attempt to construct a paradoxical decomposition using only four pieces. This would necessitate a 4-set partition of the group $F_2$. A natural way to do this is to merge the identity set $\\{e\\}$ with one of the other sets. Let's define such a 4-set partition as follows:\n- $K_1 = S(a) \\cup \\{e\\}$\n- $K_2 = S(a^{-1})$\n- $K_3 = S(b)$\n- $K_4 = S(b^{-1})$\n\nThe objective of a paradoxical decomposition is to partition the group $F_2$ into these four sets, and then reassemble them using left-multiplication (the group's own operation, corresponding to rotations on the sphere) to form two full copies of $F_2$.

Also $g\\notin gK_{2}$ (this would require $e\\in K_{2}$, which is false). Hence $g$ is in neither $K_{1}$ nor $gK_{2}$, contradicting coverage. Therefore $g$ must start with $a$.\n\n2) Write $g=au$ in reduced form. For any $w\\in K_{2}$, we have $w$ starting with $a^{-1}$, so $gw=au\\cdot w$ reduces by canceling the initial $a\\cdot a^{-1}$ to $u\\cdot w'$, where $w'$ is the tail of $w$. If $u$ is nontrivial and starts with $a$, then for every $w'$ the product $u\\cdot w'$ begins with $a$, so $gw$ begins with $a$, placing $gw$ in $K_{1}$ and violating disjointness. Thus $u$ cannot start with $a$, and the only way to avoid this for all $w$ is $u=e$, i.e., $g=a$.\n\nTherefore, disjointness forces $g=a$.\n\nBut with $g=a$, we also have $e\\in aK_{2}$ because $a\\cdot a^{-1}=e$.

Concretely, the natural (and in fact forced by coverage) choice $g=a$ yields overlap at $e$; any other $g$ fails coverage. Hence the obstacle is precisely the failure of disjointness at $e$.\n\nWe briefly evaluate the options:\n- A is irrelevant; pieces in Banach-Tarski are not subgroups.\n- B is false; $K_{1}\\cup aK_{2}=F_{2}$ holds, but they are not disjoint.\n- C is irrelevant; the axiom of choice does not depend on the number of partition sets here.\n- D captures the identity-overlap obstruction just shown.\n- E is not the core issue; symmetry breaking is not an insurmountable algebraic obstruction.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1446533"}]}
