A powerful way to characterize this set is through base-3 (ternary) representations. A number $x$ in $[0, 1]$ belongs to the Cantor set if and only if it has at least one ternary expansion consisting solely of the digits 0 and 2.\n\nFor any number $x \\in [0, 1]$, its standard ternary expansion can be written as an infinite series $x = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_k}{3^k}$ or in positional notation as $0.d_1 d_2 d_3 \\dots_3$, where each digit $d_k$ is an element of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. This expansion is unique for most numbers; for numbers that have two possible ternary expansions (which are the rational numbers where one expansion terminates, such as $1/3=0.1_3=0.0222\\dots_3$), we define the standard expansion as the one that does not end in an infinite tail of 2s (i.e., we use the terminating expansion $0.1_3$).\n\nConsider the number $x = \\frac{19}{81}$.

Write the standard ternary expansion as $x=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{d_{k}}{3^{k}}$, where each $d_{k}\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$.
