An experimental apparatus is used to determine the final state, but its resolution is limited. Specifically, the apparatus can only distinguish between the following three groups of states:\n- Group 1: States $\\{1, 2\\}$\n- Group 2: States $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$\n- Group 3: State $\\{6\\}$\n\nThis means that if the system ends up in state 1, the apparatus registers an outcome corresponding to \"Group 1\", but it cannot tell whether the state was 1 or 2. A similar ambiguity exists for Group 2. State 6 is uniquely identifiable.\n\nAn \"event\" is a subset of $X$. An event is considered \"decidable\" if, for any outcome of the experiment, one can definitively determine whether the true final state of the system belongs to that event or not. For example, the event $\\{1, 2\\}$ is decidable because if the apparatus registers \"Group 1\", we know the state is in $\\{1, 2\\}$. If it registers \"Group 2\" or \"Group 3\", we know the state is not in $\\{1, 2\\}$. However, the event $\\{1, 3\\}$ is not decidable.\n\nThe collection of all decidable events forms a $\\sigma$-algebra on $X$.

Fix a unit vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and, for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let\n$$\n\\ell_{t} := \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\langle v, x \\rangle = t\\}\n$$\nbe the line perpendicular to $v$ at level $t$.

For all $t$ in an open interval $(a,b)$, the section $D_{t} = D \\cap \\ell_{t}$ is a nonempty open interval in the line $\\ell_{t}$. Such a section is neither countable nor co-countable in $\\ell_{t}$, because its complement in $\\ell_{t}$ is the union of two unbounded intervals, which is uncountable. Since $(a,b)$ is uncountable, we can choose $t \\in (a,b)$ with $\\ell_{t} \\notin \\mathcal{L}_{0}$. By Fact 2, if $D \\in \\sigma(\\mathcal{L}_{0})$, then $D_{t}$ must be countable or co-countable in $\\ell_{t}$, a contradiction.
