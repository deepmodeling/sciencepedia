We will demonstrate that $\\mathcal{C}$ is in fact the entire sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{Z})$ by using a monotone class argument.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a monotone class. A collection of sets is a monotone class if it is closed under countable increasing unions and countable decreasing intersections.\n1.

Our strategy is to find an algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ such that $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A})=\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{Z})$ and show that $\\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}$ be the collection of all subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}$ that are either finite or cofinite (i.e., their complement is finite).\n- $\\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra:\n    - $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{A}$ because it is a finite set.\n    - If $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is finite, its complement $A^c$ is cofinite, so $A^c \\in \\mathcal{A}$. If $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is cofinite, its complement $A^c$ is finite, so $A^c \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under complementation.\n    - If $A, B \\in \\mathcal{A}$, then $A \\cup B$ is also in $\\mathcal{A}$. (If both are finite, the union is finite. If one is finite and the other cofinite, the union is cofinite. If both are cofinite, the union is cofinite). Thus, $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under finite unions.\n- $\\mathcal{A}$ generates $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{Z})$: For any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the singleton set $\\{n\\}$ is a finite set, so $\\{n\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Any sigma-algebra on $\\mathbb{Z}$ that contains all singletons must be the full power set $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A}) = \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nNow we show that $\\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$.\n- Let $F \\in \\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set. We can write $F = \\{n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k\\}$ for some integers. By the additivity of measures and the given condition:\n$$ \\mu(F) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\mu(\\{n_i\\}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\nu(\\{n_i\\}) = \\nu(F) $$\nSo, all finite sets are in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n- Let $E \\in \\mathcal{A}$ be a cofinite set. Then its complement, $E^c$, is a finite set. From the previous step, we know that $\\mu(E^c) = \\nu(E^c)$. To compare $\\mu(E)$ and $\\nu(E)$, we first compare the total measures $\\mu(\\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\nu(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\mathbb{Z} = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\{n\\}$ is a countable disjoint union, by countable additivity:\n$$ \\mu(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\mu(\\{n\\}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nu(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\nu(\\{n\\}) $$\nSince $\\mu(\\{n\\}) = \\nu(\\{n\\})$ for every $n$, the sums are equal, so $\\mu(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\nu(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nNow, since $\\mu$ is a finite measure, we can write $\\mu(E) = \\mu(\\mathbb{Z}) - \\mu(E^c)$. Similarly, $\\nu(E) = \\nu(\\mathbb{Z}) - \\nu(E^c)$. As we have established that $\\mu(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\nu(\\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\mu(E^c) = \\nu(E^c)$, it follows that $\\mu(E) = \\nu(E)$. So, all cofinite sets are also in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nWe have shown that $\\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$. Since $\\mathcal{C}$ is a monotone class containing the algebra $\\mathcal{A}$, it must contain the smallest monotone class containing $\\mathcal{A}$. By the Monotone Class Theorem, this is $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A})$. So, $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A}) \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$.\nWe already showed that $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A}) = \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{Z})$.
