P1, P2, and P3", "solution": "To determine which properties the collection $\\mathcal{A}$ satisfies, we must examine each property—(P1), (P2), and (P3)—individually. The collection $\\mathcal{A}$ consists of all finite disjoint unions of intervals from the set $\\mathcal{I} = \\{ (a,b] : a,b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\} \\cup \\{ (-\\infty, b] : b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\} \\cup \\{ (a, \\infty) : a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$.\n\n**Analysis of Property (P2): Closure under Complementation**\n\nLet's first check if the collection is closed under complements, as this is often a strong structural property. We begin by finding the complements of the basic interval types that generate the sets in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n- If $I = (a, b]$, its complement is $I^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus(a,b] = (-\\infty, a] \\cup (b, \\infty)$. This is a disjoint union of two intervals, $(-\\infty, a]$ and $(b, \\infty)$, both of which are among the allowed types. Therefore, $I^c \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- If $I = (-\\infty, b]$, its complement is $I^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus(-\\infty,b] = (b, \\infty)$. This is a single interval of an allowed type, so $I^c \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- If $I = (a, \\infty)$, its complement is $I^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus(a,\\infty) = (-\\infty, a]$. This is also a single interval of an allowed type, so $I^c \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nNow, consider a general set $S \\in \\mathcal{A}$. By definition, $S$ can be written as a finite disjoint union of such intervals, $S = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} I_k$, where each $I_k$ is one of the allowed interval types and $I_j \\cap I_k = \\emptyset$ for $j \\neq k$.\nThe complement of $S$ is given by De Morgan's laws:\n$$S^c = \\left( \\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} I_k \\right)^c = \\bigcap_{k=1}^{n} I_k^c$$\nWe have already shown that for each generator interval $I_k$, its complement $I_k^c$ is in $\\mathcal{A}$. That is, $I_k^c$ is a finite disjoint union of allowed interval types.\nLet $A$ and $B$ be two sets in $\\mathcal{A}$. We need to show that their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also in $\\mathcal{A}$. Let $A = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} U_i$ and $B = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} V_j$. Then $A \\cap B = \\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} U_i\\right) \\cap \\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} V_j\\right) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} \\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} (U_i \\cap V_j)$.\nThe intersection of two of our basic interval types is always another (possibly empty) interval of one of the allowed types. For instance, $(a,b] \\cap (c,d] = (\\max(a,c), \\min(b,d)]$. The result is a finite union of intervals of the allowed types. This union may not be disjoint, but any finite union of such intervals can be rewritten as a finite *disjoint* union of such intervals by ordering all endpoints and forming new intervals.\nThus, the finite intersection of sets in $\\mathcal{A}$ is a set in $\\mathcal{A}$. Since each $I_k^c$ is in $\\mathcal{A}$, their finite intersection $S_c = \\bigcap_{k=1}^{n} I_k^c$ is also in $\\mathcal{A}$.\nTherefore, the property (P2) of closure under complementation holds.\n\n**Analysis of Property (P1): Closure under Finite Union**\n\nLet $S_1, S_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$. We need to check if $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$. We can use the property (P2) we just proved.\nSince $S_1, S_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$, their complements $S_1^c, S_2^c$ are also in $\\mathcal{A}$.\nAs shown above, the intersection of a finite number of sets in $\\mathcal{A}$ is also in $\\mathcal{A}$. Thus, $S_1^c \\cap S_2^c \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\nNow, taking the complement again (which we know we can do), we get $(S_1^c \\cap S_2^c)^c \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\nBy De Morgan's laws, $(S_1^c \\cap S_2^c)^c = S_1 \\cup S_2$.\nSo, $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$. By induction, this holds for any finite union.\nTherefore, the property (P1) of closure under finite union holds.\n\n**Analysis of Property (P3): Closure under Countable Union**\n\nTo check this property, we look for a counterexample: a countable sequence of sets from $\\mathcal{A}$ whose union is not in $\\mathcal{A}$.\nConsider the sequence of sets $\\{S_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ defined by $S_n = (0, 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}]$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n- For $n=1$, $S_1 = (0, 1/2]$.\n- For $n=2$, $S_2 = (0, 2/3]$.\n- And so on.\nEach $S_n$ is a single interval of the form $(a,b]$, so each $S_n \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\nNow consider the countable union of these sets:\n$$ S = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} S_n = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(0, 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}\\right] $$\nSince the intervals are nested ($S_1 \\subset S_2 \\subset S_3 \\subset \\dots$), the union is the open interval $(0, 1)$.\nThe question is now: Is the set $S=(0,1)$ in the collection $\\mathcal{A}$?\nA set is in $\\mathcal{A}$ only if it can be written as a *finite* disjoint union of intervals of the form $(a, b]$, $(-\\infty, b]$, or $(a, \\infty)$.\nThe set $(0,1)$ is bounded, so any representation of it in $\\mathcal{A}$ can only use intervals of the form $(a_k, b_k]$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $(0,1)$ could be written as a finite disjoint union of such intervals:\n$$ (0,1) = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{m} (a_k, b_k] $$\nLet $b_{\\max} = \\max\\{b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m\\}$. Since this is a finite set of real numbers, the maximum exists.\nBecause the union is disjoint, the supremum of the set $\\bigcup_{k=1}^{m} (a_k, b_k]$ is $b_{\\max}$, and this supremum $b_{\\max}$ is an element of the set itself (it must be the right endpoint of one of the intervals).\nHowever, the set $(0,1)$ has a supremum of $1$, and $1$ is not an element of $(0,1)$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the open interval $(0,1)$ cannot be expressed as a finite disjoint union of intervals of type $(a,b]$, and thus $(0,1) \\notin \\mathcal{A}$.\nWe have found a countable union of sets in $\\mathcal{A}$ that is not in $\\mathcal{A}$. Thus, property (P3) does not hold.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe collection $\\mathcal{A}$ satisfies properties (P1) and (P2), but not (P3).
