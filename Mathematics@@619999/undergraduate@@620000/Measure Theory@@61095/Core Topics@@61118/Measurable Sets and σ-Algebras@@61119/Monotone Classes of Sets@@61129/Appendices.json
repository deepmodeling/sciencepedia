Since $x, y \\in A$, there exist $n_x, n_y$ such that $x \\in A_{n_x}$ and $y \\in A_{n_y}$. Let $N = \\max(n_x, n_y)$. Since the sequence is increasing, $A_{n_x} \\subseteq A_N$ and $A_{n_y} \\subseteq A_N$, so both $x, y \\in A_N$. Since $A_N$ is an interval, it must be that $z \\in A_N$. Thus $z \\in A$. This shows $A$ is an interval, so $A \\in \\mathcal{D}$.\n  - Let $\\{B_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be a decreasing sequence of intervals in $\\mathcal{D}$. Let $B = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n$. Take any $x, y \\in B$ with $x < y$, and any $z$ with $x < z < y$. Since $x, y \\in B$, it means $x, y \\in B_n$ for all $n$. As each $B_n$ is an interval, it must be that $z \\in B_n$ for all $n$. Therefore, $z \\in \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n = B$.

Both are intervals, so $A, B \\in \\mathcal{D}$.\n  - The symmetric difference is $A \\Delta B = (A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A)$.\n  - $A \\setminus B = (0, 2) \\setminus (1, 3) = (0, 1]$.\n  - $B \\setminus A = (1, 3) \\setminus (0, 2) = [2, 3)$.\n  - So, $A \\Delta B = (0, 1] \\cup [2, 3)$.\n  - Is this set an interval? No. For example, $1 \\in A \\Delta B$ and $2 \\in A \\Delta B$, but the point $1.5$, which is between 1 and 2, is not in $A \\Delta B$.\n  - Therefore, $A \\Delta B \\notin \\mathcal{D}$, and the collection is not closed under symmetric difference.\n  - Since $\\mathcal{D}$ is a monotone class but is not closed under symmetric difference, it is a valid counterexample.\n\n**Option E: $\\mathcal{E}$, the collection of all Borel sets of $\\mathbb{R}$**\n- Is it a monotone class?\n  - A $\\sigma$-algebra is, by definition, closed under countable unions and complements. Closure under complements and countable unions implies closure under countable intersections (via De Morgan's laws: $\\bigcap A_n = (\\bigcup A_n^c)^c$). An increasing union is a countable union. A decreasing intersection is a countable intersection. Thus, any $\\sigma$-algebra is a monotone class. So $\\mathcal{E}$ is a monotone class.\n- Is it closed under symmetric difference?\n  - Let $A, B$ be Borel sets. A $\\sigma$-algebra is also an algebra, meaning it's closed under finite unions and complements.\n  - $A \\Delta B = (A \\cap B^c) \\cup (B \\cap A^c)$.\n  - Since $A, B \\in \\mathcal{E}$, their complements $A^c, B^c \\in \\mathcal{E}$.\n  - Since $\\mathcal{E}$ is closed under (finite) intersections, $A \\cap B^c \\in \\mathcal{E}$ and $B \\cap A^c \\in \\mathcal{E}$.\n  - Since $\\mathcal{E}$ is closed under (finite) unions, their union $(A \\cap B^c) \\cup (B \\cap A^c)$ is in $\\mathcal{E}$.\n  - So $\\mathcal{E}$ is closed under symmetric difference.
