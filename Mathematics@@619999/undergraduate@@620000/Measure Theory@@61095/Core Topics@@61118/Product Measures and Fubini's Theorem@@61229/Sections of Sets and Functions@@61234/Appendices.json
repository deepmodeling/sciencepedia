The total probability must be 1, so we have the condition:\n$$ \\iint_R f(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = 1 $$\nSubstituting the given PDF and domain, we get:\n$$ C \\iint_R (x^3+y) \\,dx\\,dy = 1 $$\n$$ C \\int_0^2 \\int_0^1 (x^3+y) \\,dx\\,dy = 1 $$\nThe integrand $g(x,y) = x^3+y$ is non-negative on the domain $R$. Therefore, by Tonelli's theorem, we can evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in either order. Let's integrate with respect to $x$ first:\n$$ \\int_0^1 (x^3+y) \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{4} + yx \\right]_{x=0}^{x=1} = \\left(\\frac{1^4}{4} + y(1)\\right) - (0) = \\frac{1}{4} + y $$\nNow, we integrate this result with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\int_0^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + y\\right) \\,dy = \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}y + \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right]_{y=0}^{y=2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}(2) + \\frac{2^2}{2}\\right) - (0) = \\frac{1}{2} + 2 = \\frac{5}{2} $$\nSo, the value of the integral is $\\frac{5}{2}$. The normalization condition becomes:\n$$ C \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = 1 \\implies C = \\frac{2}{5} $$\nNow that we have the constant $C$, we can calculate the expected value $E[X]$.
