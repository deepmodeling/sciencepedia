We can solve this by applying the Fubini-Tonelli theorem, which relates the measure of a set in a product space to the measures of its one-dimensional sections.\n\nLet's consider the product measure space $([0,1] \\times [0,1], \\mathcal{L} \\otimes \\mathcal{L}, \\lambda \\times \\lambda)$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the $\\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets on $[0,1]$ and $\\lambda$ is the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure.\n\nThe Fubini-Tonelli theorem has a powerful corollary regarding the measurability of a set. A set $E$ in the product space is measurable if its sections are measurable and the function defined by the measure of these sections is also measurable. If these conditions hold, the measure of the set can be found by integrating the measures of its sections.\n\nLet's define the vertical sections of the set $E$. For any fixed $x_0 \\in [0, 1]$, the section $E_{x_0}$ is the set of all $y \\in [0, 1]$ such that $(x_0, y) \\in E$.\n$$\nE_{x_0} = \\{y \\in [0, 1] \\mid (x_0, y) \\in E\\}\n$$\nUsing the definition of $E$, we have:\n$$\nE_{x_0} = \\{y \\in [0, 1] \\mid x_0+y \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}\n$$\nThis condition means that for a point $y$ to be in $E_{x_0}$, the sum $x_0+y$ must be equal to some rational number $q$. Let's write this as $x_0+y = q$, which implies $y = q - x_0$.\nSo, for a fixed $x_0$, the section $E_{x_0}$ consists of all numbers of the form $q - x_0$ that lie in the interval $[0, 1]$, where $q$ is any rational number.\n$$\nE_{x_0} = \\{q - x_0 \\mid q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\} \\cap [0, 1]\n$$\nThe set $\\{q - x_0 \\mid q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$ is a translation of the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set, any translation of it is also a countable set. The intersection of a countable set with any other set (in this case, $[0, 1]$) results in a set that is at most countable (i.e., finite or countably infinite).\n\nTherefore, for any choice of $x_0 \\in [0, 1]$, the section $E_{x_0}$ is a countable subset of $[0, 1]$.\n\nNow, we must consider the measurability and the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure, $\\lambda$, of these sections.\n1.  **Measurability of sections**: Any countable set of real numbers is Lebesgue measurable. This is because it can be expressed as a countable union of single-point sets (e.g., $E_{x_0} = \\bigcup_{y \\in E_{x_0}} \\{y\\}$), and single-point sets are measurable (having measure zero). A countable union of measurable sets is measurable. Thus, for every $x_0 \\in [0, 1]$, the section $E_{x_0}$ is a Lebesgue measurable set.\n\n2.  **Measure of sections**: The one-dimensional Lebesgue measure of any countable set of real numbers is zero. This follows from the countable additivity of measure: $\\lambda(E_{x_0}) = \\lambda(\\bigcup_{y \\in E_{x_0}} \\{y\\}) \\le \\sum_{y \\in E_{x_0}} \\lambda(\\{y\\}) = \\sum_{y \\in E_{x_0}} 0 = 0$. So, $\\lambda(E_{x_0}) = 0$.\n\nNow we define a function $f: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = \\lambda(E_x)$. From our analysis, we have found that for every $x \\in [0, 1]$, $f(x) = \\lambda(E_x) = 0$.\nThe function $f(x) = 0$ is a constant function. Constant functions are continuous, and all continuous functions are Lebesgue measurable.\n\nSince the sections $E_x$ are measurable for all $x \\in [0,1]$ and the function $f(x) = \\lambda(E_x)$ is measurable, we can conclude from the Fubini-Tonelli theorem that the set $E$ is indeed product-Lebesgue measurable. This immediately rules out option A.\n\nFurthermore, the theorem allows us to compute the two-dimensional measure of $E$ by integrating the measures of its sections:\n$$\n\\lambda^2(E) = \\int_{[0,1]} \\lambda(E_x) \\, d\\lambda(x) = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx\n$$\nSubstituting $f(x) = 0$, we get:\n$$\n\\lambda^2(E) = \\int_0^1 0 \\, dx = 0\n$$\nThus, the set $E$ is Lebesgue measurable, and its measure is 0.
