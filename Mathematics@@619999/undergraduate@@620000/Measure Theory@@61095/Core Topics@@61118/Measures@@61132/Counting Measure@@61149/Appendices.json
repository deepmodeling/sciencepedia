This practice demonstrates this principle, showing that for a discrete space, the Lebesgue integral $\\int f \\, d\\mu$ is simply the sum of the function's values over the elements of the set.

The divisors of 30 are:\n$X = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30\\}$.\n\nNext, we recall the definition of the Lebesgue integral with respect to the counting measure. For any non-negative measurable function on a discrete set, this integral is equivalent to the sum of the function's values at each point in the set. Since our function $f$ is real-valued, and the integral of a real-valued function is defined as $\\int f d\\mu = \\int f^+ d\\mu - \\int f^- d\\mu$ (where $f^+$ and $f^-$ are the positive and negative parts of $f$), we can apply the same summation principle as long as the sum is well-defined (i.e., not of the form $\\infty - \\infty$).
