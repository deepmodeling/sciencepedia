The power set $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is always a $\\sigma$-algebra on $X$. It also contains the generating collection $\\mathcal{G} = \\{\\{1, 2\\}, \\{2, 3\\}\\}$ since $\\{1, 2\\}$ and $\\{2, 3\\}$ are subsets of $X$.\n    Since $\\Sigma$ is the *smallest* $\\sigma$-algebra containing $\\mathcal{G}$, and we've shown $\\mathcal{P}(X) \\subseteq \\Sigma$, and we know $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a valid sigma-algebra containing $\\mathcal{G}$, it must be that $\\Sigma = \\mathcal{P}(X)$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Options**:\n    - A: The power set of $X$, $\\mathcal{P}(X)$.
