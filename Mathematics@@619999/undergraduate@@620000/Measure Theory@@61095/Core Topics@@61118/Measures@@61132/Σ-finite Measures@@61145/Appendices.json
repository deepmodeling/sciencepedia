First, let's recall the definition of a $\\sigma$-finite measure. A measure $\\mu$ on a measurable space $(X, \\mathcal{A})$ is said to be $\\sigma$-finite if there exists a sequence of sets $\\{E_k\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ such that $X = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} E_k$ and $\\mu(E_k) < \\infty$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nIn our case, the space is $X=\\mathbb{R}$. We will test the condition given in option C, which states that $c_n < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We will prove that this condition is both sufficient and necessary.\n\n**Part 1: Proving Sufficiency**\nWe assume that $c_n < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and we must show that $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite. To do this, we need to find a collection of measurable sets $\\{E_k\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ that cover $\\mathbb{R}$ and have finite measure under $\\mu$.\n\nLet us consider the sequence of closed intervals $E_k = [-k, k]$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. Each $E_k$ is a Borel set. The union of these sets is $\\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} E_k = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} [-k, k] = \\mathbb{R}$. So, this sequence of sets covers the entire real line.\n\nNow, we must check if the measure of each set in this sequence is finite. Let's compute $\\mu(E_k)$ for an arbitrary $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n$$\n\\mu(E_k) = \\mu([-k, k]) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n \\delta_n([-k, k])\n$$\nBy the definition of the Dirac measure $\\delta_n$, the term $\\delta_n([-k, k])$ is equal to $1$ if the integer $n$ is in the interval $[-k, k]$, and $0$ otherwise. The integers in the interval $[-k, k]$ are $\\{-k, -k+1, \\dots, 0, \\dots, k-1, k\\}$. Therefore, the infinite sum reduces to a finite sum over these integers:\n$$\n\\mu(E_k) = \\sum_{n=-k}^{k} c_n\n$$\nWe assumed that $c_n < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The sum $\\sum_{n=-k}^{k} c_n$ is a sum of a finite number of finite terms ($2k+1$ terms, to be exact). A finite sum of finite numbers is always finite. Thus, $\\mu(E_k) < \\infty$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nSince we have found a sequence of sets $\\{E_k\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ such that $\\mathbb{R} = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} E_k$ and $\\mu(E_k) < \\infty$ for all $k$, the measure $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite. This proves that the condition \"$c_n < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\" is sufficient.\n\n**Part 2: Proving Necessity**\nNow, we assume that the measure $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite, and we must show that this implies $c_n < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite, by definition, there exists a sequence of measurable sets $\\{A_k\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ such that $\\mathbb{R} = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} A_k$ and $\\mu(A_k) < \\infty$ for all $k$.\n\nLet $m$ be an arbitrary integer in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Since the collection $\\{A_k\\}$ covers all of $\\mathbb{R}$, the integer $m$ must belong to at least one of these sets. Let's say $m \\in A_{k_0}$ for some index $k_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the measure of the singleton set $\\{m\\}$. This set is a Borel set. By the definition of our measure $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu(\\{m\\}) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n \\delta_n(\\{m\\})\n$$\nThe term $\\delta_n(\\{m\\})$ is $1$ only when $n=m$ and is $0$ for all other integers $n$. Thus, the sum collapses to a single term:\n$$\n\\mu(\\{m\\}) = c_m \\cdot \\delta_m(\\{m\\}) = c_m \\cdot 1 = c_m\n$$\nSince the set $\\{m\\}$ is a subset of $A_{k_0}$ (i.e., $\\{m\\} \\subseteq A_{k_0}$), the monotonicity property of measures states that $\\mu(\\{m\\}) \\le \\mu(A_{k_0})$.\n\nCombining these results, we have $c_m = \\mu(\\{m\\}) \\le \\mu(A_{k_0})$.\nBy our assumption that $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite, we know that $\\mu(A_{k_0})$ is a finite number. Therefore, we must have $c_m < \\infty$.\n\nSince we chose $m$ as an arbitrary integer, this argument holds for every integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, it must be that $c_n < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This proves that the condition is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that the condition \"$c_n < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\" is both necessary and sufficient for $\\mu$ to be $\\sigma$-finite. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options to see why they are incorrect.\n- **A (Bounded):** If $\\{c_n\\}$ is bounded, it is a sufficient condition (as shown in the sufficiency proof, $\\mu(E_k) = \\sum_{-k}^k c_n \\le (2k+1)M < \\infty$). However, it is not necessary. For example, if $c_n = |n|+1$, then $c_n < \\infty$ for all $n$, so $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite, but the sequence $\\{c_n\\}$ is not bounded.\n- **B (Finite Measure):** This is the condition for $\\mu$ to be a finite measure ($\\mu(\\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n < \\infty$), which is a stronger condition than being $\\sigma$-finite. For example, if $c_n=1$ for all $n$, $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite but not finite. So this condition is sufficient but not necessary.\n- **D (Converges to zero):** This is not necessary, as the case $c_n=1$ for all $n$ provides a counterexample.\n- **E (Never $\\sigma$-finite):** This is false, as the case $c_n=1$ for all $n$ provides a counterexample of a non-trivial $\\sigma$-finite measure of this form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1466769"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the idea of combining measures, we now consider a 'hybrid' measure formed by adding the continuous Lebesgue measure and a discrete counting measure on the integers.
