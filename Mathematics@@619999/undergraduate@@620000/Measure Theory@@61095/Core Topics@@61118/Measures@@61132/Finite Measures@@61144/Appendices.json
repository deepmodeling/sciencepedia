The measure $\\mu$ is defined based on the number of letters in the name of each fruit in the set.\n\nFirst, we identify the set $X$ and define the weight function $w(x)$ for each element $x \\in X$. The set is $X = \\{\\text{apple, banana, cherry, date}\\}$. The weight $w(x)$ for an element $x$ is the number of letters in its name.\n\nLet's calculate the weight for each element in $X$:\n- For $x = \\text{apple}$, the name has 5 letters, so $w(\\text{apple}) = 5$.\n- For $x = \\text{banana}$, the name has 6 letters, so $w(\\text{banana}) = 6$.\n- For $x = \\text{cherry}$, the name has 6 letters, so $w(\\text{cherry}) = 6$.\n- For $x = \\text{date}$, the name has 4 letters, so $w(\\text{date}) = 4$.\n\nNext, we identify the subset $S$. The problem states that $S$ is the subset of $X$ containing all fruits whose names include the letter 'e'. We check each element of $X$:\n- 'apple' contains the letter 'e'.\n- 'banana' does not contain the letter 'e'.\n- 'cherry' contains the letter 'e'.\n- 'date' contains the letter 'e'.\nTherefore, the subset $S$ is $S = \\{\\text{apple, cherry, date}\\}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the measure of $S$ using the given definition, $\\mu(A) = \\sum_{x \\in A} w(x)$.
