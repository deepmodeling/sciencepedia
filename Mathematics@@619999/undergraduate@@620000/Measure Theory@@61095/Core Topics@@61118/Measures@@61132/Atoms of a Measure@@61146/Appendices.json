It is fundamentally impossible for $A^c$ to also be an atom.**\nTo disprove this, we need a counterexample. Consider the set $X = \\{1, 2\\}$, with the power set as the sigma-algebra, $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathcal{P}(X) = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{1, 2\\}\\}$.

We have $\\mu(\\emptyset)=0$ and $\\mu(\\{1\\})=1=\\mu(A)$. So, $A$ is an atom.\nNow consider its complement, $A^c = \\{2\\}$. We have $\\mu(A^c)=1>0$. The measurable subsets of $A^c$ are $\\emptyset$ and $\\{2\\}$. We have $\\mu(\\emptyset)=0$ and $\\mu(\\{2\\})=1=\\mu(A^c)$. So, $A^c$ is also an atom.\nThis simple construction shows that it is possible for both $A$ and $A^c$ to be atoms. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\n**B. $A^c$ can be an atom, but only if the entire space $X$ is itself an atom.**\nLet's assume $X$ is an atom. By definition, $\\mu(X) > 0$. For any measurable subset $E \\in \\mathcal{M}$, either $\\mu(E)=0$ or $\\mu(E)=\\mu(X)$.\nWe are given that $A$ is an atom, so $\\mu(A)>0$. Since $A$ is a measurable subset of $X$, and $X$ is an atom, we must have $\\mu(A) = \\mu(X)$.\nFrom the additivity of the measure, $\\mu(X) = \\mu(A) + \\mu(A^c)$.\nSubstituting $\\mu(A) = \\mu(X)$, we get $\\mu(X) = \\mu(X) + \\mu(A^c)$, which implies $\\mu(A^c) = 0$.\nHowever, for $A^c$ to be an atom, it must have a strictly positive measure. Thus, if $X$ is an atom, $A^c$ cannot be an atom. This shows the condition is not only unnecessary, but it actually prevents the desired outcome. Statement B is false.\n\n**C. This is always true; if $A$ is an atom in a finite measure space, its complement $A^c$ must also be an atom.**\nTo disprove this, we need a counterexample. Let $X = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, with $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathcal{P}(X)$. Define a measure $\\mu$ by $\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 1$, $\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 1$, and $\\mu(\\{3\\}) = 1$.

The measurable subsets of $A$ are $\\emptyset$ and $\\{1\\}$. $\\mu(\\emptyset)=0$ and $\\mu(\\{1\\})=1=\\mu(A)$, so $A$ is an atom.\nNow consider its complement, $A^c = \\{2, 3\\}$. We have $\\mu(A^c)=2 > 0. Let's check the second condition for an atom. Consider the set $B=\\{2\\}$. $B$ is a measurable subset of $A^c$. Its measure is $\\mu(B)=1$. The measure of $A^c$ is $\\mu(A^c)=2$. Since $0 < \\mu(B) < \\mu(A^c)$, the set $A^c$ is not an atom because we found a subset with intermediate positive measure. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\n**E. $A^c$ can be an atom, but only if the underlying set $X$ is finite and $\\mu$ is the counting measure.**\nThe \"only if\" part makes this a very strong claim. Our counterexample for C used a finite set with a counting measure and it failed, showing that these conditions are not sufficient. Furthermore, let's reconsider the counterexample for A: $X = \\{1, 2\\}$, $\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 1$, $\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 2$. Here $A=\\{1\\}$ is an atom, and $A^c=\\{2\\}$ is an atom, but $\\mu$ is not the counting measure. Thus, the condition is not necessary. Statement E is false.\n\n**D. $A^c$ can be an atom. For instance, this occurs if the sigma-algebra is $\\mathcal{M} = \\{\\emptyset, A, A^c, X\\}$ and the measures $\\mu(A)$ and $\\mu(A^c)$ are both positive.**\nThis statement makes a claim about a specific scenario. Let's verify it.\nAssume $\\mathcal{M} = \\{\\emptyset, A, A^c, X\\}$ and $\\mu(A)>0$, $\\mu(A^c)>0$.\n1.  Check if $A$ is an atom. We are given $\\mu(A)>0$. The measurable subsets of $A$ are the sets $B \\in \\mathcal{M}$ such that $B \\subseteq A$. Looking at our $\\mathcal{M}$, the only such sets are $\\emptyset$ and $A$. For these subsets, we have $\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0$ and $\\mu(A) = \\mu(A)$. The conditions for $A$ being an atom are satisfied.\n2.  Check if $A^c$ is an atom. We are given $\\mu(A^c)>0$. The measurable subsets of $A^c$ are the sets $B \\in \\mathcal{M}$ such that $B \\subseteq A^c$. Looking at our $\\mathcal{M}$, the only such sets are $\\emptyset$ and $A^c$. For these subsets, we have $\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0$ and $\\mu(A^c) = \\mu(A^c)$. The conditions for $A^c$ being an atom are satisfied.\nThis construction is valid. It describes a situation where both $A$ and its complement $A^c$ are atoms. This can be built on any set $X$ (finite or infinite) by partitioning it into two pieces $A$ and $A^c$ and defining the sigma-algebra and measure appropriately.
