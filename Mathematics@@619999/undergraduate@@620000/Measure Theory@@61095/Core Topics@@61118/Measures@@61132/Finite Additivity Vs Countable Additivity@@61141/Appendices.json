In the notation provided, $A = 2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $B = 3\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe set $S$ consists of integers that are not in $A$ and not in $B$. This means $S$ is the intersection of the complements of $A$ and $B$.\n$$ S = A^c \\cap B^c $$\nUsing De Morgan's laws, we can rewrite $S$ as the complement of the union of $A$ and $B$:\n$$ S = (A \\cup B)^c $$\nThe entire space is the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$.
