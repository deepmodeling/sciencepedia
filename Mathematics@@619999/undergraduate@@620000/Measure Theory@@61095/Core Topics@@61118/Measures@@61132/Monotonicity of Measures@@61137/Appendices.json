The solution relies on the fundamental properties of a measure. Let's recall the definition of a measure $\\mu$ on a measurable space $(X, \\mathcal{M})$.\nA measure $\\mu: \\mathcal{M} \\to [0, \\infty]$ must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  The measure of the empty set is zero: $\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n2.  Countable additivity: For any countable sequence of pairwise disjoint sets $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$ in $\\mathcal{M}$, we have $\\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} E_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mu(E_i)$.\n\nFrom these axioms, two crucial properties can be derived.\n\nFirst, non-negativity: By its very definition, the codomain of a measure $\\mu$ is $[0, \\infty]$. This means that for any set $E \\in \\mathcal{M}$, its measure $\\mu(E)$ must be greater than or equal to zero.\n$$ \\mu(E) \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall E \\in \\mathcal{M} $$\n\nSecond, monotonicity: If $A, B \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and $A \\subseteq B$, then $\\mu(A) \\le \\mu(B)$. We can prove this from the axioms. Since $A \\subseteq B$, we can write $B$ as the disjoint union of two measurable sets: $B = A \\cup (B \\setminus A)$. By the countable additivity property (which also applies to finite disjoint unions), we have:\n$$ \\mu(B) = \\mu(A \\cup (B \\setminus A)) = \\mu(A) + \\mu(B \\setminus A) $$\nFrom the non-negativity property, we know that $\\mu(B \\setminus A) \\ge 0$. Therefore,\n$$ \\mu(B) = \\mu(A) + (\\text{a non-negative value}) \\ge \\mu(A) $$\nThis confirms the monotonicity property: $\\mu(A) \\le \\mu(B)$.\n\nNow let's apply these properties to the specific case given in the problem.\nWe are given two sets, $N$ and $A$, both in the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{M}$.\nThe given information is:\n1.  $\\mu(N) = 0$ (N is a null set).\n2.  $A \\subseteq N$ (A is a subset of N).\n\nFrom the non-negativity property, since $A$ is a measurable set ($A \\in \\mathcal{M}$), its measure must be non-negative:\n$$ \\mu(A) \\ge 0 $$\n\nFrom the monotonicity property, since $A$ is a subset of $N$ ($A \\subseteq N$), its measure must be less than or equal to the measure of $N$:\n$$ \\mu(A) \\le \\mu(N) $$\nWe are given that $\\mu(N) = 0$, so this inequality becomes:\n$$ \\mu(A) \\le 0 $$\n\nCombining the two results, we have the double inequality:\n$$ 0 \\le \\mu(A) \\le 0 $$\nThe only real number that satisfies this condition is 0. Therefore, we must have $\\mu(A) = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\nA. $\\mu(A) = 0$. This is the conclusion of our derivation. It is always true.\nB. $\\mu(A)$ can be any non-negative real number less than or equal to $\\mu(X)$. This is false. It directly contradicts the monotonicity property which constrains $\\mu(A)$ to be less than or equal to $\\mu(N) = 0$.\nC. $\\mu(A)$ is undefined because a subset of a null set is not necessarily measurable. This is false. The problem statement explicitly says that $A \\in \\mathcal{M}$, which means $A$ is a measurable set by definition. The statement addresses a subtlety in measure theory (completeness of a measure), but it is irrelevant here as $A$ is assumed to be measurable.\nD. $\\mu(A)$ depends on the specific choice of the measure $\\mu$; it could be zero for the Lebesgue measure but positive for other measures. This is false. Our derivation used only the fundamental axioms of a measure, which are valid for *any* measure $\\mu$ on any measure space. The result is general and not specific to the Lebesgue measure.\nE. $0  \\mu(A)  \\mu(N)$ is impossible, but $\\mu(A)$ could be negative if the measure is a signed measure. This is false. The standard definition of a measure $\\mu$ in a \"measure space\" implies a positive measure, meaning its range is $[0, \\infty]$. It cannot take negative values. While signed measures exist, they are a different mathematical object.\n\nThus, the only statement that is always true is that the measure of $A$ is 0.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1432981"}, {"introduction": "Measure theory provides the rigorous language needed to formalize our intuitive understanding of geometric concepts like length, area, and volume.
