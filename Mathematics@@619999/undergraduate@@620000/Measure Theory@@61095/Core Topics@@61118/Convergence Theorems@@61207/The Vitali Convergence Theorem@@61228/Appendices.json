For any fixed $x \\in [0, \\infty)$, we can find a natural number $N$ such that $N > x$. For all $n \\ge N$, the interval $(n, n+1]$ does not contain $x$.

When $x=n$, $u=0$. When $x=n+1$, $u=1$.\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u}} du = \\int_0^1 u^{-1/2} du = \\left[ 2u^{1/2} \\right]_0^1 = 2\\sqrt{1} - \\lim_{a \\to 0^+} 2\\sqrt{a} = 2. $$\nSo, for all $n$, we have $\\int |f_n| dm = 2$.\nTherefore, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int |f_n - f| dm = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 2 = 2 \\neq 0$.\nThe sequence does not converge in $L^1$. According to the Vitali Convergence Theorem, since the sequence converges pointwise but not in $L^1$, at least one of the conditions—uniform integrability or tightness—must fail. This immediately implies that statement D is false.\n\n**Step 3: Uniform Integrability**\nWe check the condition $\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\sup_{n} \\int_{\\{|f_n| > M\\}} |f_n| dm = 0$.\nFirst, we find the set where $|f_n(x)| > M$. This is the set of $x \\in (n, n+1]$ such that $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x-n}} > M$. This inequality is equivalent to $\\sqrt{x-n} < 1/M$, or $x-n < 1/M^2$, which means $x < n + 1/M^2$.\nSo, the set is $(n, n + 1/M^2)$. Note that for this set to be non-empty, we need $n + 1/M^2 > n$, which is always true for $M>0$, and we need the upper bound to be within $(n, n+1]$, which means $n+1/M^2 \\le n+1$, or $1/M^2 \\le 1$, which is true for $M \\ge 1$.\nThe integral is:\n$$ \\int_{\\{|f_n| > M\\}} |f_n| dm = \\int_n^{n+1/M^2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x-n}} dx. $$\nUsing the same substitution $u = x-n$, the integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_0^{1/M^2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u}} du = \\left[ 2u^{1/2} \\right]_0^{1/M^2} = 2\\sqrt{1/M^2} = \\frac{2}{M}. $$\nThis result is independent of $n$. Thus, for any $M \\ge 1$:\n$$ \\sup_{n} \\int_{\\{|f_n| > M\\}} |f_n| dm = \\frac{2}{M}. $$\nNow we take the limit as $M \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\sup_{n} \\int_{\\{|f_n| > M\\}} |f_n| dm = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{M} = 0. $$\nThe condition for uniform integrability is satisfied. This eliminates statements B and E.\n\n**Step 4: Tightness**\nWe check if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a set $E$ with $m(E) < \\infty$ such that $\\sup_{n} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\setminus E} |f_n| dm < \\epsilon$.\nLet's choose a candidate set $E = [0, K]$ for some large $K > 0$. The measure is finite, $m(E) = K$. The complement is $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\setminus E = (K, \\infty)$.\nWe need to evaluate the supremum:\n$$ \\sup_{n} \\int_K^\\infty |f_n(x)| dx = \\sup_{n} \\int_{(K, \\infty) \\cap (n, n+1]} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x-n}} dx. $$\nNo matter how large we choose $K$, we can always find an integer $n$ such that $n > K$. For any such $n$, the entire support of $f_n$, which is $(n, n+1]$, is contained in $(K, \\infty)$.\nFor any $n > K$, the integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_K^\\infty |f_n(x)| dx = \\int_n^{n+1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x-n}} dx = 2. $$\nSince for any $K$, we can find an $n>K$ for which the integral is 2, the supremum over all $n$ must be at least 2.\n$$ \\sup_{n} \\int_K^\\infty |f_n(x)| dx \\ge 2. $$\nIn fact, the supremum is exactly 2. We cannot make this value arbitrarily small by choosing a large $K$. For example, we cannot make it less than $\\epsilon = 1$.\nTherefore, the tightness condition fails.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ is uniformly integrable but not tight.
