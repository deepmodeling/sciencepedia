A good candidate for the limit is often the pointwise limit, or a function that is equal to the pointwise limit almost everywhere. Let's find the pointwise limit of $f_n(x)$.\nFor $x=0$, $f_n(0) = \\cos(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{[0, 1/n]}(0) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. So, $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(0) = 1$.\nFor any $x \\in (0, 1]$, by the Archimedean property, we can find an integer $N$ such that $N  1/x$, which implies $1/N  x$. For all $n \\ge N$, we have $1/n \\le 1/N  x$. This means that for $n \\ge N$, $x \\notin [0, 1/n]$, and therefore $\\mathbf{1}_{[0, 1/n]}(x) = 0$.

So, for any $x \\in (0, 1]$, $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(x) = 0$.\nThe pointwise limit function is $g(x) = 1$ for $x=0$ and $g(x)=0$ for $x \\in (0,1]$. This function is equal to the zero function $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere, since they differ only on the set $\\{0\\}$, which has Lebesgue measure zero. We will test for convergence in measure to the zero function, $f(x)=0$.\n\nA sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ converges in measure to $f$ if for every $\\epsilon  0$, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mu(\\{x \\in [0,1] : |f_n(x) - f(x)| \\ge \\epsilon\\}) = 0$.\nIn our case, we check if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mu(\\{x \\in [0,1] : |f_n(x)| \\ge \\epsilon\\}) = 0$. Let $E_n(\\epsilon) = \\{x \\in [0,1] : |f_n(x)| \\ge \\epsilon\\}$.\nThe function $f_n(x)$ is non-zero only on the interval $[0, 1/n]$. Thus, $E_n(\\epsilon)$ must be a subset of $[0, 1/n]$.\nOn this interval, $f_n(x) = \\cos(x)$. For $x \\in [0, 1/n] \\subseteq [0, 1]$, $\\cos(x)$ is positive, so the condition $|f_n(x)| \\ge \\epsilon$ becomes $\\cos(x) \\ge \\epsilon$.\nIf $\\epsilon  1$, $\\cos(x) \\ge \\epsilon$ is never true, so $E_n(\\epsilon) = \\emptyset$ and its measure is $0$.

Since $\\arccos$ is a decreasing function, this is equivalent to $x \\le \\arccos(\\epsilon)$.\nSo, the set $E_n(\\epsilon)$ is the set of points $x$ that satisfy both $x \\in [0, 1/n]$ and $x \\le \\arccos(\\epsilon)$.\nThis gives $E_n(\\epsilon) = [0, 1/n] \\cap [0, \\arccos(\\epsilon)] = [0, \\min(1/n, \\arccos(\\epsilon))]$.\nThe Lebesgue measure is $\\mu(E_n(\\epsilon)) = \\min(1/n, \\arccos(\\epsilon))$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, we have $1/n \\to 0$.

The functions $f_n$ are measurable. Since $\\{f_n\\}$ converges in measure to the zero function, Riesz's theorem applies. The theorem guarantees that there exists a subsequence $\\{f_{n_k}\\}$ that converges almost everywhere to the zero function.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. For uniform convergence to zero, we would need $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} |f_{n_k}(x)| = 0$. However, for any $n_k$, $\\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} |f_{n_k}(x)| = f_{n_k}(0) = \\cos(0) = 1$. The limit is 1, not 0. So, A is false.\nB. Pointwise convergence *for every* $x$ to the zero function is false. At $x=0$, $f_n(0) = 1$ for all $n$, so any subsequence also has $f_{n_k}(0)=1$, which converges to 1, not 0. So, B is false.\nC. This option describes $L^1$ convergence. Let's check it: $\\|f_n - 0\\|_{L^1} = \\int_0^1 |f_n(x)| d\\mu(x) = \\int_0^{1/n} |\\cos(x)| d\\mu(x) = \\int_0^{1/n} \\cos(x) dx = [\\sin(x)]_0^{1/n} = \\sin(1/n)$. As $n\\to\\infty$, $\\sin(1/n) \\to 0$. So, the sequence does converge in $L^1$. However, the question asks for the conclusion of Riesz's theorem on convergence in measure, which is about almost everywhere convergence, not $L^1$ convergence. Although $L^1$ convergence implies the existence of an a.e. convergent subsequence (a related theorem), statement C is not the direct conclusion of the theorem cited.\nD. This statement says that for some subsequence $\\{f_{n_k}\\}$, $\\mu(\\{x \\in [0,1] : \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} f_{n_k}(x) \\ne 0\\}) = 0$. This is the definition of almost everywhere convergence to the zero function. This is precisely the conclusion guaranteed by Riesz's theorem.\nE. This is a stronger version of B for the original sequence.
