To apply the MCT, we must verify three conditions:\n1.  $f_n(x)$ is non-negative for all $n \\ge 1$ and $x \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n2.  The sequence $\\{f_n(x)\\}$ is monotonically non-decreasing for all $x \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n3.  The functions $f_n$ are measurable.\n\n**Step 1: Non-negativity**\nFor any $x \\in (0, \\infty)$ and integer $n \\ge 1$, the term $x/n$ is positive. Thus, $(1 + x/n)$ is positive. Raising a positive number to any power $n$ results in a positive number. The term $e^{-2x}$ is also positive for all real $x$. Therefore, $f_n(x) = (1+\\frac{x}{n})^n e^{-2x}$ is the product of two positive terms and is itself positive, so $f_n(x) \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Measurability**\nThe function $x \\mapsto (1+x/n)$ is continuous, and so is the power function $y \\mapsto y^n$. The exponential function is also continuous. Since continuous functions are Borel measurable, each $f_n(x)$, being a composition and product of continuous functions, is continuous and therefore measurable on $(0, \\infty)$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\n\n**Step 3: Monotonicity**\nWe need to show that $f_n(x) \\le f_{n+1}(x)$ for all $n \\ge 1$ and for a fixed $x > 0$. This is equivalent to showing that the sequence $a_n = (1+\\frac{x}{n})^n$ is non-decreasing.\nConsider the function $g(t) = (1 + \\frac{x}{t})^t$ for $t > 0$. We want to show that $g(t)$ is a non-decreasing function of $t$. We analyze its logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(g(t)) = \\ln\\left[\\left(1+\\frac{x}{t}\\right)^t\\right] = t \\ln\\left(1+\\frac{x}{t}\\right)\n$$\nLet's find the derivative of $\\ln(g(t))$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(g(t)) = 1 \\cdot \\ln\\left(1+\\frac{x}{t}\\right) + t \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{x}{t}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{x}{t^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\ln\\left(1+\\frac{x}{t}\\right) - \\frac{x/t}{1+\\frac{x}{t}}\n$$\nLet $u = x/t$. Since $x > 0$ and $t > 0$, we have $u > 0$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nh(u) = \\ln(1+u) - \\frac{u}{1+u}\n$$\nWe want to show that $h(u) \\ge 0$ for $u > 0$. Let's analyze the function $h(u)$.\nFirst, evaluate at the boundary of its domain: $h(0) = \\ln(1+0) - \\frac{0}{1+0} = 0$.\nNext, find the derivative of $h(u)$ with respect to $u$:\n$$\nh'(u) = \\frac{1}{1+u} - \\frac{1 \\cdot (1+u) - u \\cdot 1}{(1+u)^2} = \\frac{1}{1+u} - \\frac{1}{(1+u)^2}\n$$\n$$\nh'(u) = \\frac{(1+u) - 1}{(1+u)^2} = \\frac{u}{(1+u)^2}\n$$\nFor $u > 0$, the numerator $u$ is positive and the denominator $(1+u)^2$ is positive. Thus, $h'(u) > 0$ for all $u > 0$. This implies that $h(u)$ is a strictly increasing function on $(0, \\infty)$.\nSince $h(0) = 0$ and $h(u)$ is increasing, we must have $h(u) > 0$ for all $u > 0$.\nThis means $\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(g(t)) > 0$ for all $t > 0$. Therefore, $\\ln(g(t))$ is an increasing function of $t$. Since the exponential function $y \\mapsto e^y$ is increasing, $g(t) = e^{\\ln(g(t))}$ must also be an increasing function of $t$.\nThis proves that $a_n = (1+\\frac{x}{n})^n$ is an increasing sequence in $n$. Since $e^{-2x}$ is a positive factor that does not depend on $n$, the sequence $f_n(x) = (1+\\frac{x}{n})^n e^{-2x}$ is non-decreasing for each $x > 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Pointwise Limit**\nNow we find the pointwise limit of the sequence $f_n(x)$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Let $f(x) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(x)$.\n$$\nf(x) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n e^{-2x} = \\left(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n\\right) e^{-2x}\n$$\nUsing the well-known limit formula $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(1+a/n)^n = e^a$, we have:\n$$\nf(x) = e^x \\cdot e^{-2x} = e^{x-2x} = e^{-x}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Application of MCT and Final Calculation**\nSince all conditions of the Monotone Convergence Theorem are satisfied, we can interchange the limit and the integral:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_0^\\infty f_n(x) \\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(x)\\right) \\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty f(x) \\,dx\n$$\nSubstituting the pointwise limit $f(x)=e^{-x}$:\n$$\nL = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} \\,dx\n$$\nWe evaluate this improper integral:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{b\\to\\infty} \\int_0^b e^{-x} \\,dx = \\lim_{b\\to\\infty} \\left[-e^{-x}\\right]_0^b = \\lim_{b\\to\\infty} (-e^{-b} - (-e^0))\n$$\n$$\nL = \\lim_{b\\to\\infty} (-e^{-b} + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1\n$$\nThe value of the limit is 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "7528"}, {"introduction": "This next problem introduces a common challenge: the domain of integration changes with the sequence index.

Pointwise Convergence**\nWe need to find the pointwise limit of the sequence $g_k(x)$ as $k \\to \\infty$. Let's call this limit $g(x)$. For any fixed $x \\ge 0$, as $k \\to \\infty$, there will be a point beyond which $k > x$, so $\\chi_{[0, k]}(x) = 1$.

Setting $y = -x/k$ (which is a valid real number), we get:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{x}{k} \\le e^{-x/k}\n$$\nSince both sides are non-negative for $x \\in [0, k]$, we can raise them to the power of $k$:\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{x}{k}\\right)^k \\le \\left(e^{-x/k}\\right)^k = e^{-x}\n$$\nThis inequality holds for all $x \\in [0, k]$.
