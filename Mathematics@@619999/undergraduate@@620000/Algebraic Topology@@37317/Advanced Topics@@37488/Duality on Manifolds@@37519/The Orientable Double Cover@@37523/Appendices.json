For a non-orientable manifold like a Möbius strip, attempting to parallel transport a normal vector around certain closed loops results in the vector pointing in the opposite direction upon returning to the start. This behavior can be resolved by considering the manifold's orientable double cover.\n\nLet a Möbius strip, $M$, be constructed from the rectangle $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [-1, 1]$ by identifying the points $(0, v)$ with $(2\\pi, -v)$ for all $v \\in [-1, 1]$.

The Klein bottle provides a perfect example for applying a concrete algorithm to build its orientable double cover from a fundamental polygon. This exercise guides you through the process of 'cutting and pasting' two copies of the Klein bottle's polygon, following specific rules for orientation-preserving and orientation-reversing edges, to reveal the resulting orientable surface. [@problem_id:1688108]", "problem": "The Klein bottle, denoted as $K$, is a non-orientable surface that can be constructed from a square fundamental polygon, $P$, by identifying its edges. The identification is described by traversing the boundary of the square and reading the labels of the edges, resulting in the boundary word $abab^{-1}$. This means the bottom edge (labeled $a$) is identified with the top edge (also labeled $a$), and the right edge (labeled $b$) is identified with the left edge (labeled $b^{-1}$, indicating opposite orientation).\n\nEvery non-orientable surface has an orientable double cover. This is an orientable surface $E$ that \"covers\" the original surface $K$ with a 2-to-1 projection map $p: E \\to K$. We can construct the fundamental polygon of $E$ by taking two copies of the fundamental polygon of $K$, which we will call $P_1$ and $P_2$, and determining how their edges should be glued together.\n\nThe rule for gluing is as follows: For any edge identification on the original polygon $P$ that reverses orientation, the corresponding lifted edges in the cover must be identified by swapping sheets. That is, the edge on $P_1$ is glued to the corresponding edge on $P_2$. For any edge identification that preserves orientation, the corresponding lifted edges are identified within the same sheet (i.e., the edge on $P_1$ is glued to another edge on $P_1$).\n\nYour task is to apply this construction to the Klein bottle. By considering the two polygons $P_1$ and $P_2$ and their required identifications, determine the boundary word for the fundamental polygon of the resulting single, connected, orientable surface $E$.\n\nWhich of the following represents the boundary word of the fundamental polygon for the orientable double cover of the Klein bottle?\n\nA. $aa$\n\nB. $abab$\n\nC. $abab^{-1}$\n\nD. $cdc^{-1}d^{-1}$\n\nE. $aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}$", "solution": "We start with the Klein bottle fundamental polygon having boundary word\n$$a b a b^{-1}.$$\nIn this word, the pair of $a$-edges appears with the same sign, hence the $a$-identification reverses orientation, while the $b$-edges appear as $b$ and $b^{-1}$, hence the $b$-identification preserves orientation.\n\nTo construct the orientable double cover, take two copies $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ of this polygon, each with boundary word $a b a b^{-1}$. Apply the lifting rule:\n\n1) For the orientation-reversing edges ($a$-pair), we must swap sheets when gluing. Thus the $a$-edges of $P_{1}$ are glued to the corresponding $a$-edges of $P_{2}$, specifically pairing top of $P_{1}$ with bottom of $P_{2}$ and bottom of $P_{1}$ with top of $P_{2}$. After this step, the $a$-edges are fully used as internal seams and no longer appear on the boundary. The two squares $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ become a single connected rectangle whose remaining boundary consists only of the vertical $b$-edges: the right boundary is the concatenation of the two $b$-edges (both oriented upward), and the left boundary is the concatenation of the two $b^{-1}$-edges (both oriented downward). Denote the long right edge by $d$ and the long left edge by $d^{-1}$.\n\n2) For the orientation-preserving edges ($b$-pair), the lifting rule says to glue within the same sheet. On the combined rectangle, this amounts to identifying the long right edge $d$ with the long left edge $d^{-1}$ in an orientation-preserving manner (each sheet’s right edge glues to that sheet’s left edge). This produces a surface that is topologically a torus.\n\nTo write a fundamental polygon for this surface, cut along the internal seam formed by the $a$-gluings to expose a horizontal pair of edges that occur with opposite orientations; label them $c$ and $c^{-1}$. Traversing the boundary of the resulting single square yields the standard torus boundary word\n$$c d c^{-1} d^{-1}.$$\nThis is the commutator form for an orientable genus one surface, i.e., a torus.\n\nTherefore, the boundary word for the orientable double cover of the Klein bottle is $c d c^{-1} d^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1688108"}, {"introduction": "While direct construction is insightful, algebraic invariants provide a more powerful tool for identifying covering spaces, especially for complex surfaces.
