Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be two simple closed curves on $\\Sigma_g$. A simple curve is one that does not self-intersect. These two curves are known to satisfy three specific properties:\n1.  They are non-separating, meaning that cutting the surface along either curve does not disconnect it (i.e., the complements $\\Sigma_g \\setminus \\alpha$ and $\\Sigma_g \\setminus \\beta$ are both connected).\n2.  They are homologous, meaning they represent the same element in the first homology group with integer coefficients, denoted by $[\\alpha] = [\\beta]$ in $H_1(\\Sigma_g; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  They are not homotopic, meaning it is impossible to continuously deform curve $\\alpha$ into curve $\\beta$ through an ambient isotopy on the surface.\n\nTo analyze the relationship between such curves, we use two tools from algebraic topology. First, the algebraic intersection number $i(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ of two oriented closed curves $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ is an integer that counts their signed intersections. It is a property of their homology classes, meaning $i(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ depends only on $[\\lambda_1]$ and $[\\lambda_2]$. Second, a Dehn twist $T_\\gamma$ about a simple closed curve $\\gamma$ is a specific self-homeomorphism of $\\Sigma_g$ supported in an annular neighborhood of $\\gamma$. The action of a Dehn twist on the homology class of any closed curve $\\lambda$ is described by the Picard-Lefschetz formula: $[T_\\gamma(\\lambda)] = [\\lambda] + i(\\lambda, \\gamma)[\\gamma]$.\n\nGiven the properties of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which one of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. The curves $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can be continuously deformed into a pair of disjoint curves.\nB. The algebraic intersection number, $i(\\alpha, \\beta)$, must be non-zero.\nC. The union of the curves, $\\alpha \\cup \\beta$, forms the boundary of a subsurface of $\\Sigma_g$ that is homeomorphic to a punctured torus (a surface of genus 1 with one boundary component).\nD. For any simple closed curve $\\gamma$ on $\\Sigma_g$, the curves $\\alpha' = T_\\gamma(\\alpha)$ and $\\beta' = T_\\gamma(\\beta)$ are homologous but not homotopic to each other.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which of the four statements is a necessary consequence of two simple closed curves $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ on a surface $\\Sigma_g$ ($g \\geq 2$) being non-separating, homologous, and not homotopic.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis statement claims that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can be made disjoint through homotopy. Two disjoint simple closed curves $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ on a surface are homologous if and only if they co-bound an annulus (a cylinder). If two curves co-bound an annulus, they are homotopic. However, the problem states that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are not homotopic. Therefore, they cannot co-bound an annulus. Since they are homologous, the fact that they are not homotopic implies they cannot be deformed into a disjoint pair. Thus, statement A must be false.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement claims that the algebraic intersection number $i(\\alpha, \\beta)$ must be non-zero. The algebraic intersection number is a bilinear form on the first homology group $H_1(\\Sigma_g; \\mathbb{Z})$. This means $i(\\alpha, \\beta)$ depends only on the homology classes $[\\alpha]$ and $[\\beta]$. The problem states that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homologous, so $[\\alpha] = [\\beta]$.\nTherefore, we can calculate the intersection number as:\n$$i(\\alpha, \\beta) = i([\\alpha], [\\beta]) = i([\\alpha], [\\alpha])$$\nFor any homology class $[\\lambda]$ on an orientable surface, the algebraic self-intersection number $i([\\lambda], [\\lambda])$ is always zero. To see this, consider the standard symplectic basis $\\{[a_1], [b_1], \\dots, [a_g], [b_g]\\}$ for $H_1(\\Sigma_g; \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $[\\lambda] = \\sum_{k=1}^g (c_k [a_k] + d_k [b_k])$. Then, using the properties $i(a_k, a_j) = i(b_k, b_j)=0$ and $i(a_k, b_j)=\\delta_{kj}$, we have:\n$$i([\\lambda], [\\lambda]) = \\sum_{j,k=1}^g (c_j c_k i(a_j, a_k) + d_j d_k i(b_j, b_k) + c_j d_k i(a_j, b_k) + d_j c_k i(b_j, a_k))$$\n$$i([\\lambda], [\\lambda]) = \\sum_{k=1}^g (c_k d_k i(a_k, b_k) + d_k c_k i(b_k, a_k)) = \\sum_{k=1}^g (c_k d_k - d_k c_k) = 0$$\nSince $i(\\alpha, \\beta) = i([\\alpha], [\\alpha]) = 0$, statement B must be false.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement suggests that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must bound a punctured torus. If two homologous curves $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ bound a subsurface $S$ (so $\\partial S = \\alpha \\cup \\beta$), their non-homotopy implies that $S$ cannot be an annulus. If $S$ is a punctured torus (a genus 1 surface with two boundary components), then $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ would indeed be homologous but not homotopic. This provides one possible geometric realization for such a pair of curves. However, the question asks what *must* be true. There exists another construction for such pairs: let $c$ be a separating simple closed curve, and let $\\alpha$ be a non-separating curve that intersects $c$. The curve $\\beta = T_c(\\alpha)$ (the image of $\\alpha$ under a Dehn twist about $c$) is homologous to $\\alpha$ but not homotopic. In this case, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ co-bound a subsurface that is an annulus containing the \"obstacle\" $c$, which is not a punctured torus. Since there are other possible configurations, it is not necessary for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to bound a punctured torus. Therefore, statement C is not always true and must be false.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement claims that for any simple closed curve $\\gamma$, the twisted curves $\\alpha' = T_\\gamma(\\alpha)$ and $\\beta' = T_\\gamma(\\beta)$ remain homologous but not homotopic.\nFirst, let's check if they are homologous. We use the Picard-Lefschetz formula provided:\n$$[\\alpha'] = [T_\\gamma(\\alpha)] = [\\alpha] + i(\\alpha, \\gamma)[\\gamma]$$\n$$[\\beta'] = [T_\\gamma(\\beta)] = [\\beta] + i(\\beta, \\gamma)[\\gamma]$$\nWe are given that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homologous, so $[\\alpha] = [\\beta]$. Because the intersection number is a homology invariant, we also have $i(\\alpha, \\gamma) = i([\\alpha], [\\gamma]) = i([\\beta], [\\gamma]) = i(\\beta, \\gamma)$.\nSubstituting these equalities, we find:\n$$[\\beta'] = [\\alpha] + i(\\alpha, \\gamma)[\\gamma] = [\\alpha']$$\nSo, $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta'$ are indeed homologous.\n\nNext, let's check if they are not homotopic. A Dehn twist $T_\\gamma$ is a homeomorphism of the surface $\\Sigma_g$. Homeomorphisms preserve topological properties, including whether two curves are homotopic. If $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta'$ were homotopic, there would exist an isotopy (a continuous deformation) from $\\alpha'$ to $\\beta'$. Let this isotopy be represented by a family of homeomorphisms $\\phi_t$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ with $\\phi_0 = \\text{id}$ and $\\phi_1(\\alpha') = \\beta'$. This means $\\phi_1(T_\\gamma(\\alpha)) = T_\\gamma(\\beta)$.\nApplying the inverse homeomorphism $T_\\gamma^{-1}$ to both sides, we get $(T_\\gamma^{-1} \\phi_1 T_\\gamma)(\\alpha) = \\beta$.\nThe map $\\psi_1 = T_\\gamma^{-1} \\phi_1 T_\\gamma$ is a homeomorphism. Furthermore, because $\\phi_t$ is an isotopy from the identity, $\\psi_t = T_\\gamma^{-1} \\phi_t T_\\gamma$ is also an isotopy from the identity. This implies that $\\psi_1$ is isotopic to the identity. The existence of such a map $\\psi_1$ means that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homotopic. But this contradicts the initial premise that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are not homotopic.\nTherefore, our assumption that $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta'$ are homotopic must be false. They must remain non-homotopic.\nBoth conditions hold, so statement D must be true.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1658965"}]}
