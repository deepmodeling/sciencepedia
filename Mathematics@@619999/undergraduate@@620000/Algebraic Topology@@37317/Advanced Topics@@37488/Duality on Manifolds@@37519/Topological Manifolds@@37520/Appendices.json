We will analyze each option by considering the geometric interpretation of the \"gluing\" process determined by the given boundary identifications.\n\n**Option A:** The relation is generated by $(0, y) \\sim (1, 1-y)$ for all $y \\in [0, 1]$.\nThis relation identifies the left edge of the square (where $x=0$) with the right edge of the square (where $x=1$). Let's examine how the points are matched. A point $(0, y)$ on the left edge, at a height $y$ from the bottom, is identified with the point $(1, 1-y)$ on the right edge. The point $(1, 1-y)$ is at a height $1-y$ from the bottom, which is equivalent to a height $y$ from the top. For example, the bottom-left corner $(0, 0)$ is glued to the top-right corner $(1, 1)$, and the top-left corner $(0, 1)$ is glued to the bottom-right corner $(1, 0)$. This reversal of the vertical orientation corresponds to performing a half-twist (a $180^\\circ$ rotation) on one edge before gluing it to the opposite edge. A rectangular strip glued in this manner is the standard construction of a Möbius strip. Thus, this option correctly describes the Möbius strip. The remaining edges, the bottom edge from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ and the top edge from $(0,1)$ to $(1,1)$, are joined end-to-end to form the single boundary of the strip.\n\n**Option B:** The relation is generated by $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$ for all $y \\in [0, 1]$.\nThis relation also identifies the left edge with the right edge. However, a point $(0, y)$ on the left edge is identified with the point $(1, y)$ at the same height on the right edge. There is no reversal of the vertical orientation. This is equivalent to taking a rectangular strip and gluing the opposite ends together without any twist. The resulting surface is a cylinder or, topologically, an annulus. This is not a Möbius strip.\n\n**Option C:** The relation is generated by two sets of identifications: $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$ and $(x, 0) \\sim (x, 1)$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe first identification, $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$, creates a cylinder as we saw in Option B. This cylinder has two boundary components: a circle formed by the bottom edge ($y=0$) and a circle formed by the top edge ($y=1$). The second identification, $(x, 0) \\sim (x, 1)$, glues these two boundary circles together. A point on the bottom circle is glued to the point directly above it on the top circle. This closes the cylinder into a doughnut shape. The resulting surface is a torus. This is not a Möbius strip.\n\n**Option D:** The relation is generated by two sets of identifications: $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$ and $(x, 0) \\sim (1-x, 1)$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nSimilar to Option C, the first identification, $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$, creates a cylinder. The second identification, $(x, 0) \\sim (1-x, 1)$, glues the two circular boundaries of the cylinder together. However, this time the gluing involves a directional reversal. A point at angular position $x$ on the bottom circle is glued to the point at angular position $1-x$ on the top circle. To achieve this, the cylinder must pass through itself before the ends are joined. The resulting surface is a Klein bottle, a non-orientable surface with no boundary.
