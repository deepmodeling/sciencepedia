A common and effective strategy to compute the induced map in cohomology is to first compute the induced map in homology, $f_*: H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(S^1 \\vee S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$, and then use the property of duality. The cohomology map $f^*$ is the dual (or transpose, in terms of matrices) of the homology map $f_*$ with respect to dual bases.\n\nFirst, let's identify the homology groups and their generators.\nThe first homology group of the circle is $H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The problem statement implicitly defines a generator for this group via the loop $\\gamma$. Let's call the homology class represented by this loop $g = [\\gamma]$. So, $\\{g\\}$ is a basis for $H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe first homology group of the wedge sum of two circles is $H_1(S^1 \\vee S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. The problem defines loops $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ for each circle in the wedge. Their homology classes, $g_1 = [\\gamma_1]$ and $g_2 = [\\gamma_2]$, form a basis for $H_1(S^1 \\vee S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$. We use the ordered basis $\\{g_1, g_2\\}$.\n\nNow, we compute the action of the induced map $f_*: H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(S^1 \\vee S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$ on the generator $g$. By definition, $f_*(g) = f_*([\\gamma])$. Functoriality of homology means $f_*([\\gamma]) = [f \\circ \\gamma]$. The problem states that the map $f$ is defined such that $f \\circ \\gamma$ is the path composition $\\gamma_1 * \\gamma_2$. Therefore, in homology, the class of the composite path is the sum of the individual classes:\n$$f_*(g) = [\\gamma_1 * \\gamma_2] = [\\gamma_1] + [\\gamma_2] = g_1 + g_2$$\nSo, the map $f_*$ sends the generator $g$ to the element $g_1 + g_2$.\n\nWe want to find the matrix of $f_*: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ with respect to the basis $\\{g\\}$ for the domain and $\\{g_1, g_2\\}$ for the codomain. An element $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is represented by the vector $(k)$ in the domain basis. The map takes the basis vector $g$ (represented by $1$) to $g_1 + g_2$, which is represented by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ in the codomain basis. Thus, the matrix for $f_*$ is:\n$$ M_{f_*} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we consider the cohomology groups. The problem provides the bases for the cohomology groups. For $H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$, the basis is $\\{\\beta\\}$. For $H^1(S^1 \\vee S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$, the ordered basis is $\\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\}$. We are told that $\\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\}$ is the dual basis to $\\{g_1, g_2\\}$, which means $\\langle \\alpha_i, g_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the evaluation pairing between cohomology and homology, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Similarly, we can assume $\\beta$ is the dual generator to $g$, so $\\langle \\beta, g \\rangle = 1$.\n\nThe induced map in cohomology $f^*: H^1(S^1 \\vee S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the dual of $f_*$. With respect to the chosen dual bases, the matrix representation of $f^*$ is the transpose of the matrix representation of $f_*$.\nThe matrix for $f_*$ is a $2 \\times 1$ matrix. Therefore, the matrix for $f^*$ will be a $1 \\times 2$ matrix, obtained by taking the transpose of $M_{f_*}$.\n$$ M_{f^*} = (M_{f_*})^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThis matrix tells us how $f^*$ acts on the basis vectors. Specifically, $f^*(\\alpha_1) = 1 \\cdot \\beta$ and $f^*(\\alpha_2) = 1 \\cdot \\beta$. This means any cohomology class $c = c_1 \\alpha_1 + c_2 \\alpha_2 \\in H^1(S^1 \\vee S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$ is mapped to:\n$$ f^*(c_1 \\alpha_1 + c_2 \\alpha_2) = c_1 f^*(\\alpha_1) + c_2 f^*(\\alpha_2) = c_1 \\beta + c_2 \\beta = (c_1 + c_2)\\beta $$\nThis is consistent with the matrix multiplication:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = (c_1 + c_2) $$\nThe result of this multiplication is the coordinate of the image in the basis $\\{\\beta\\}$.
