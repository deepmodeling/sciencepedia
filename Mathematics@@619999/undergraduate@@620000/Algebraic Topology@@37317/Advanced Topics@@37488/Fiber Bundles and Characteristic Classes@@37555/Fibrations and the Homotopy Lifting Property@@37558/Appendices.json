A map that has this property for all spaces $Y$ is called a fibration.\n\nConsider the spaces $E = [0, 1]$ and $B = [0, 1]$.

Let's analyze the setup for a single-point space $Y = \\{\\star\\}$.\n\nA map from $Y$ to a space $X$ is equivalent to choosing a point in $X$.\n- An initial lift $\\tilde{f}_0: Y \\to E$ corresponds to a point $\\tilde{f}_0 \\in E$.\n- A homotopy $H: Y \\times [0, 1] \\to B$ corresponds to a path $H: [0, 1] \\to B$.\n\nThe HLP for this case states: For any path $H(t)$ in $B$ and any starting point $\\tilde{f}_0 \\in E$ such that $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = H(0)$, there must exist a continuous path $\\tilde{H}: [0, 1] \\to E$ such that:\n1. $\\tilde{H}(0) = \\tilde{f}_0$ (The lifted path starts at the initial lift).\n2. $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = H(t)$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$ (The lifted path covers the original path).\n\nWe will test each option to see if such a continuous lifted path $\\tilde{H}(t)$ exists.\n\nThe map is $p(x) = 2x$ for $x \\in [0, 1/2]$ and $p(x) = 1$ for $x \\in (1/2, 1]$.\n\n**A. Initial lift $\\tilde{f}_0 = 0$ and path $H(t) = t$.**\nFirst, check the initial condition: $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = p(0) = 2(0) = 0$. The path starts at $H(0) = 0$. Since $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = H(0)$, the setup is valid.\nWe need to find a lift $\\tilde{H}(t)$ such that $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = H(t) = t$.\nFor any $t \\in [0, 1]$, the value $H(t)=t$ is in $[0, 1]$.\nIf $t \\in [0, 1]$, then $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = t$, which means $\\tilde{H}(t)$ must be in the interval $[0, 1/2]$ where $p$ is not constant.\nSo, $2\\tilde{H}(t) = t$, which gives $\\tilde{H}(t) = t/2$.\nLet's check this candidate lift: $\\tilde{H}(t) = t/2$.\n1. Is it a continuous path? Yes, it's a linear function.\n2. Does it start at the right place? $\\tilde{H}(0) = 0/2 = 0 = \\tilde{f}_0$. Yes.\n3. Does it cover the path? $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = p(t/2) = 2(t/2) = t = H(t)$, since $t/2 \\in [0, 1/2]$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Yes.\nA lift exists, so this is not a counterexample.\n\n**B. Initial lift $\\tilde{f}_0 = 1/2$ and path $H(t) = 1 - t$.**\nCheck the initial condition: $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = p(1/2) = 2(1/2) = 1$. The path starts at $H(0) = 1 - 0 = 1$. The condition $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = H(0)$ holds.\nWe need a lift $\\tilde{H}(t)$ such that $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = 1 - t$.\nLet's define a candidate lift $\\tilde{H}(t)$. The equation $p(x) = y$ has a unique solution $x = y/2$ for $y \\in [0, 1)$, and the solution is in $[0, 1/2)$. For $y=1$, any $x \\in [1/2, 1]$ is a solution.\nFor $t \\in (0, 1]$, $H(t) = 1-t  1$. Thus, for $t \\in (0, 1]$, the lift must satisfy $2\\tilde{H}(t) = 1-t$, so $\\tilde{H}(t) = (1-t)/2$.\nFor $t=0$, we require $\\tilde{H}(0) = \\tilde{f}_0 = 1/2$.\nLet's define $\\tilde{H}(t) = (1-t)/2$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n1. Is it continuous? Yes, it's a linear function.\n2. Does it start at the right place? $\\tilde{H}(0) = (1-0)/2 = 1/2 = \\tilde{f}_0$. Yes.\n3. Does it cover the path? For $t \\in [0, 1]$, $\\tilde{H}(t)=(1-t)/2 \\in [0, 1/2]$. So, $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = 2((1-t)/2) = 1-t = H(t)$. Yes.\nA lift exists, so this is not a counterexample.\n\n**C. Initial lift $\\tilde{f}_0 = 3/4$ and path $H(t) = 1 - t$.**\nCheck the initial condition: $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = p(3/4) = 1$ (since $3/4 > 1/2$). The path starts at $H(0) = 1 - 0 = 1$. The condition holds.\nWe seek a continuous path $\\tilde{H}(t)$ with $\\tilde{H}(0) = 3/4$ and $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = 1-t$.\nFor any $t \\in (0, 1]$, we have $H(t) = 1-t  1$. For the condition $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = H(t)$ to be met, $\\tilde{H}(t)$ must be in the interval $[0, 1/2)$.\nIn this range, $p(x)=2x$, so $2\\tilde{H}(t) = 1-t$, which means $\\tilde{H}(t) = (1-t)/2$.\nSo, if a continuous lifting $\\tilde{H}(t)$ exists, it must satisfy:\n- $\\tilde{H}(0) = 3/4$ (from the problem statement)\n- $\\tilde{H}(t) = (1-t)/2$ for $t \\in (0, 1]$ (to satisfy $p \\circ \\tilde{H} = H$)\nLet's check for continuity at $t=0$. The value of the function at $t=0$ is $\\tilde{H}(0) = 3/4$.\nThe right-hand limit at $t=0$ is $\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\tilde{H}(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\frac{1-t}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $\\tilde{H}(0) = 3/4$ and $\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\tilde{H}(t) = 1/2$, the function is not continuous at $t=0$.\nTherefore, no continuous path $\\tilde{H}(t)$ can satisfy both conditions. The HLP fails. This is a counterexample.\n\n**D. Initial lift $\\tilde{f}_0 = 1/2$ and path $H(t) = 1$.**\nCheck initial condition: $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = p(1/2) = 1$. The path starts at $H(0) = 1$. The condition holds.\nWe need a lift $\\tilde{H}(t)$ with $\\tilde{H}(0)=1/2$ and $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = 1$ for all $t$.\nLet's try the constant path $\\tilde{H}(t) = 1/2$.\n1. It is continuous.\n2. $\\tilde{H}(0) = 1/2 = \\tilde{f}_0$.\n3. $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = p(1/2) = 1 = H(t)$.\nA lift exists, so this is not a counterexample. (Note that other lifts like $\\tilde{H}(t)=3/4$ also exist).\n\n**E. Initial lift $\\tilde{f}_0 = 1/4$ and path $H(t) = \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$.**\nCheck initial condition: $p(\\tilde{f}_0) = p(1/4) = 2(1/4) = 1/2$. The path starts at $H(0) = 0/2 + 1/2 = 1/2$. The condition holds.\nWe need a lift $\\tilde{H}(t)$ such that $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor $t \\in [0, 1]$, $H(t) \\in [1/2, 1]$.\nIf $H(t)  1$, then $t  1$. The lift must satisfy $2\\tilde{H}(t) = \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$, so $\\tilde{H}(t) = \\frac{t}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThis works for $H(t)  1$. What about $t=1$, where $H(1)=1$? The formula gives $\\tilde{H}(1)=1/4+1/4=1/2$, and $p(1/2)=1$. So the formula works for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's check the candidate lift $\\tilde{H}(t) = \\frac{t}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$.\n1. It is continuous (linear function).\n2. $\\tilde{H}(0) = 1/4 = \\tilde{f}_0$.\n3. Since $\\tilde{H}(t) = \\frac{t+1}{4} \\in [1/4, 1/2]$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, its image under $p$ is $p(\\tilde{H}(t)) = 2(\\frac{t+1}{4}) = \\frac{t+1}{2} = H(t)$.\nA lift exists, so this is not a counterexample.\n\nThe only case where a lift fails to exist is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1649545"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how the lifting property can fail, we now turn to a classic example where it succeeds.
