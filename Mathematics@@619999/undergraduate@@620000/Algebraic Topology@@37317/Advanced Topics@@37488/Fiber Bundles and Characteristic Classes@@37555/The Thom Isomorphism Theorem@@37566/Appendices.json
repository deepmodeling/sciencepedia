Let $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ be the canonical projection. We define an open cover $\\{U_0, U_1\\}$ for $T^2$ as follows. The point $p_0 = \\pi(0,0)$ is taken as the origin of the torus. The open set $U_1$ is a small open neighborhood of $p_0$, defined as the projection of the open disk of radius $1/4$ centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Specifically, any point in $U_1$ has a unique representative $(x,y) \\in (-1/2, 1/2) \\times (-1/2, 1/2)$ such that $x^2 + y^2 < (1/4)^2$. The second open set is $U_0 = T^2 \\setminus \\{p_0\\}$.
