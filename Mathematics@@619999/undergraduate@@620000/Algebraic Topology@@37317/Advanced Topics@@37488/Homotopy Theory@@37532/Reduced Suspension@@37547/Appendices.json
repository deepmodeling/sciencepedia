Let $I = [0,1]$ be the closed unit interval. The reduced suspension of $X$, denoted $\\Sigma X$, is the quotient space obtained from the product space $X \\times I$ by identifying the subspace $A = (X \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (X \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup (\\{x_0\\} \\times I)$ to a single point.

A proposed homotopy of the form $H(x,s) = p(x, f(s))$ is well-defined only if the range of the function $f(s)$ for $s \\in [0,1]$ is a subset of $[0,1]$. Continuity of $H$ is guaranteed if $f(s)$ is continuous, due to the properties of product and quotient topologies.\n\nThe three conditions to be checked are:\n1. Start condition: $H(x, 0) = i(x) = p(x, 1/2)$ for all $x \\in X$.\n2. End condition: $H(x, 1) = p_0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n3.

For $s \\in [0,1]$, $f(s)$ ranges continuously from $f(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$ to $f(1) = 1$. The range $[1/2, 1]$ is a subset of $[0,1]$, so the map is well-defined.\n1. Check start condition: $H(x,0) = p(x, \\frac{1+0}{2}) = p(x, 1/2) = i(x)$. The condition is satisfied.\n2. Check end condition: $H(x,1) = p(x, \\frac{1+1}{2}) = p(x, 1)$. Since $(x,1) \\in A$, its image under the quotient map is $p_0$. So, $p(x,1) = p_0$. The condition is satisfied.\n3. Check basepoint condition: $H(x_0,s) = p(x_0, \\frac{1+s}{2})$. Since $(x_0, t) \\in A$ for any $t \\in [0,1]$, its image is $p_0$. The condition is satisfied.\nAll conditions are met.

Since $(x,0) \\in A$, $p(x,0) = p_0$. This is not equal to $i(x) = p(x, 1/2)$ in general (unless $X$ is a single point).

Check start condition: $H(x,0) = p(x, 1/2) = i(x)$. The condition is satisfied.\n2. Check end condition: $H(x,1) = p(x, 1/2)$. This must be equal to $p_0$ for all $x \\in X$.

The function $\\cos(\\theta)$ over $[0,\\pi]$ takes values from $1$ to $-1$. Therefore, $f(s)$ takes values from $f(0)=1/2$ down to $f(1)=-1/2$. The range of $f(s)$ is $[-1/2, 1/2]$. This is not a subset of $[0,1]$, because for $s > 1/2$, $f(s) < 0$. Since the second coordinate in $p(x, \\cdot)$ must be in $[0,1]$, the map $H(x,s)$ is not well-defined for all $s \\in [0,1]$.\nOption D is incorrect.\n\n**Option E: $H(x,s) = p(x, \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}))$**\nLet $f(s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\pi s}{2})$. For $s \\in [0,1]$, the argument $\\frac{\\pi s}{2}$ lies in $[0, \\pi/2]$. Over this interval, $\\cos(\\theta)$ is non-negative, ranging from $1$ down to $0$. Thus, $f(s)$ ranges from $f(0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(0) = 1/2$ to $f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$. The range of $f(s)$ is $[0, 1/2]$, which is a subset of $[0,1]$. The map is well-defined.\n1. Check start condition: $H(x,0) = p(x, f(0)) = p(x, 1/2) = i(x)$. The condition is satisfied.\n2. Check end condition: $H(x,1) = p(x, f(1)) = p(x, 0)$. Since $(x,0) \\in A$, its image is $p_0$. The condition is satisfied.\n3. Check basepoint condition: $H(x_0,s) = p(x_0, \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}))$. Since the second coordinate is in $[0,1/2] \\subset [0,1]$, the point $(x_0, f(s))$ is in $\\{x_0\\}\\times I \\subset A$. Thus its image is $p_0$. The condition is satisfied.\nAll conditions are met.
