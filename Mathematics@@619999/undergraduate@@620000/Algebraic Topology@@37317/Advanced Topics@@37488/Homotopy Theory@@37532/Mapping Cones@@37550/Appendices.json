The fundamental group of such a space can be computed using the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.\n\nLet's decompose $C_f$ into two suitable open sets, $U$ and $V$. Let $V$ be the interior of the attached disk $D^2$. As an open disk, $V$ is contractible, so its fundamental group is trivial: $\\pi_1(V) = \\{1\\}$. Let $U = C_f \\setminus \\{p\\}$, where $p$ is the cone point (the center of the disk $D^2$). The set $U$ deformation retracts onto the torus $T^2$. Therefore, the fundamental group of $U$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the torus: $\\pi_1(U) \\cong \\pi_1(T^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. A presentation for this group is $\\langle a, b \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1} = 1 \\rangle$.\n\nThe intersection of these two open sets, $U \\cap V$, is an open annulus, which deformation retracts onto a circle $S^1$. Thus, its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $c$ be a generator for this group.\n\nThe Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that $\\pi_1(C_f)$ is the amalgamated free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$ along $\\pi_1(U \\cap V)$. This is given by:\n$$ \\pi_1(C_f) \\cong (\\pi_1(U) * \\pi_1(V)) / N $$\nwhere $N$ is the normal subgroup generated by elements of the form $(i_{U*}(\\gamma)) (i_{V*}(\\gamma))^{-1}$ for all $\\gamma \\in \\pi_1(U \\cap V)$. Here, $i_{U*}: \\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\to \\pi_1(U)$ and $i_{V*}: \\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\to \\pi_1(V)$ are the homomorphisms induced by the inclusion maps.\n\nSince $\\pi_1(V)$ is the trivial group, the free product $\\pi_1(U) * \\pi_1(V)$ is just $\\pi_1(U)$, and the induced map $i_{V*}$ is the trivial homomorphism.

The problem states this loop represents the element $a^6b^{10}$ in $\\pi_1(T^2)$. Therefore, $i_{U*}(c) = a^6b^{10}$. The resulting normal subgroup $N'$ is generated by this single element.\n\nCombining the presentation of $\\pi_1(U)$ with this new relation, we get a presentation for $\\pi_1(C_f)$:\n$$ \\pi_1(C_f) = \\langle a, b \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1}=1, a^6b^{10}=1 \\rangle $$\n\nNext, we find the abelianization of this group, denoted $\\pi_1(C_f)^{ab}$. The abelianization is obtained by adding relations that force all generators to commute. However, the relation $aba^{-1}b^{-1}=1$ (or $ab=ba$) is already present in our group presentation. This means that the group $\\pi_1(C_f)$ is already abelian. Thus, its abelianization is the group itself:\n$$ \\pi_1(C_f)^{ab} = \\langle a, b \\mid ab=ba, a^6b^{10}=1 \\rangle $$\n\nTo understand the structure of this group, we can represent it as a quotient of the free abelian group on two generators, $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. We can identify the generators $a$ and $b$ with the standard basis vectors $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ respectively. The relation $a^6b^{10}=1$, in additive notation, becomes $6a + 10b = 0$. This corresponds to taking the quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ by the subgroup generated by the element $6(1,0) + 10(0,1) = (6,10)$. So, we have:\n$$ \\pi_1(C_f)^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\langle (6,10) \\rangle $$\n\nTo classify this quotient group, we find the Smith Normal Form of the matrix of relations, which is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}$.
