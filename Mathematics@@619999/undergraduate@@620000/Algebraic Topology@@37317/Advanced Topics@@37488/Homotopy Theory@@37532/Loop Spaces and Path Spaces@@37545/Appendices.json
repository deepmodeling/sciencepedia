This first practice grounds the idea of a path space by applying it to the 0-sphere, $S^0$.

Infinitely many", "solution": "A path in $S^{0}$ is a continuous map $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to S^{0}$, where $S^{0}=\\{-1,1\\}$ has the discrete topology. Since $[0,1]$ is connected and $S^{0}$ is discrete, any continuous map $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to S^{0}$ must be constant: the image of a connected space is connected, and the only connected subsets of a discrete space are singletons. Therefore, the only paths are the two constant maps $\\gamma_{-}(t)\\equiv -1$ and $\\gamma_{+}(t)\\equiv 1$. Hence $\\mathcal{P}(S^{0})=\\{\\gamma_{-},\\gamma_{+}\\}$.\n\nWe now determine the path components of $\\mathcal{P}(S^{0})$ with the compact-open topology. Consider the subbasic open sets $W(K,U)=\\{f:[0,1]\\to S^{0}\\ \\text{continuous} : f(K)\\subset U\\}$ for compact $K\\subset[0,1]$ and open $U\\subset S^{0}$. Taking $K=[0,1]$ and $U=\\{-1\\}$ gives $W([0,1],\\{-1\\})=\\{\\gamma_{-}\\}$, and similarly $W([0,1],\\{1\\})=\\{\\gamma_{+}\\}$. Thus each singleton is open and the compact-open topology on $\\mathcal{P}(S^{0})$ is discrete. Any continuous path $H:[0,1]\\to\\mathcal{P}(S^{0})$ must then be constant because its domain is connected and its codomain is discrete. Equivalently, via the evaluation map, if $H$ were continuous then $\\tilde{H}(s,t)=H(s)(t):[0,1]\\times[0,1]\\to S^{0}$ would be continuous, but the domain is connected and the codomain is discrete, so $\\tilde{H}$ must be constant, forcing $H$ to be constant. Hence there is no path joining $\\gamma_{-}$ to $\\gamma_{+}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{P}(S^{0})$ has exactly two path components.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1661987"}, {"introduction": "A central goal in algebraic topology is to endow the set of loops with an algebraic structure, and the most natural operation is concatenation.
