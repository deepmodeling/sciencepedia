This first practice problem serves as a crucial check on our understanding of the theorem's core hypothesis. By applying the theorem to a familiar and relatively simple space like the 2-torus, $T^2$, we can directly observe how a lack of high connectivity severely restricts the conclusions we can draw, thereby highlighting why topologists are so interested in highly-connected spaces.

The theorem states that if $X$ is an $(n-1)$-connected CW complex, then the suspension homomorphism $S_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(SX)$ is an isomorphism for $k  2n-1$ and a surjection for $k = 2n-1$.\n\nThe student considers the space $X = S^2 \\times S^3$ and attempts to check the theorem's consistency for the group $\\pi_2(X)$. They construct an argument that leads to a sharp contradiction, which is presented below.\n\n**The Student's Argument:**\n\n**Part 1: Derivation from the Freudenthal Theorem**\n1.  The space $X = S^2 \\times S^3$ is the product of two simply-connected spheres, so its fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ is trivial. Thus, $X$ is 1-connected, which means we can apply the Freudenthal theorem with $n-1=1$, or $n=2$.\n2.  The theorem predicts that the suspension map $S_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(SX)$ is an isomorphism for $k  2(2)-1=3$.\n3.  Choosing $k=2$, we have an isomorphism $S_*: \\pi_2(S^2 \\times S^3) \\to \\pi_3(S(S^2 \\times S^3))$.\n4.  The second homotopy group of a product is the direct sum of the individual homotopy groups: $\\pi_2(S^2 \\times S^3) = \\pi_2(S^2) \\oplus \\pi_2(S^3)$.\n5.  Using the known values $\\pi_2(S^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_2(S^3) = 0$, we find $\\pi_2(S^2 \\times S^3) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n6.  Therefore, the Freudenthal theorem implies that $\\pi_3(S(S^2 \\times S^3)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Part 2: Direct Calculation**\n1.  To verify the result from Part 1, I will compute $\\pi_3(S(S^2 \\times S^3))$ by analyzing the underlying space.\n2.  For well-behaved pointed spaces like spheres, the Cartesian product $X \\times Y$ is often treated as being closely related to the smash product $X \\wedge Y$. I will use the approximation that they are homotopy equivalent, $S^2 \\times S^3 \\simeq S^2 \\wedge S^3$.\n3.  There is a standard homotopy equivalence for smash products of spheres: $S^p \\wedge S^q \\simeq S^{p+q}$. For our case, this gives $S^2 \\wedge S^3 \\simeq S^5$.\n4.  Combining these steps, the space $S^2 \\times S^3$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^5$.\n5.  The suspension operation preserves homotopy equivalence, so $S(S^2 \\times S^3) \\simeq S(S^5)$.\n6.  The suspension of a sphere is just the next higher-dimensional sphere, so $S(S^5) = S^6$.\n7.  Now I can compute the third homotopy group: $\\pi_3(S(S^2 \\times S^3)) \\cong \\pi_3(S^6)$.\n8.  It is a known result that $\\pi_k(S^m) = 0$ for $k  m$. Here, $k=3$ and $m=6$, so $\\pi_3(S^6) = 0$.\n9.
