A standard theorem in algebraic topology states that $(X, A)$ has the HEP if and only if there exists a retraction from the space $X \\times [0,1]$ to its subspace $(X \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (A \\times [0,1])$. A retraction is a continuous map from a space to a subspace that is the identity on that subspace.\n\nIt is a known result that the pair $(M, A)$ has the HEP. Your task is to identify the key geometric feature of the pair $(M, A)$ that allows for the construction of the required retraction.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why the pair $(M,A)$ has the Homotopy Extension Property?\n\nA. The Möbius strip $M$ deformation retracts onto its core circle. Since $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle, properties related to homotopy are simplified, and this allows for the extension of any homotopy defined on its boundary $A$.\n\nB. The fundamental group of the boundary, $\\pi_1(A)$, is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, and the fundamental group of the Möbius strip, $\\pi_1(M)$, is also isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. The inclusion mapping $i: A \\hookrightarrow M$ induces an injective homomorphism between these groups. This algebraic injectivity on the level of fundamental groups is a sufficient condition for the geometric property of homotopy extension.\n\nC. The region of the Möbius strip immediately adjacent to its boundary circle $A$ has a uniform, product-like structure. This neighborhood, often called a \"collar\", is homeomorphic to $A \\times [0,1)$. This regular structure near the boundary provides the necessary \"room\" to define a continuous retraction that pushes points of $M \\times [0,1]$ onto the required subspace $(M \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (A \\times [0,1])$.\n\nD. The Möbius strip is a non-orientable surface. This global topological property implies a \"twist\" that connects all regions of the space, ensuring that any local deformation (a homotopy on the boundary $A$) can always be extended to a global deformation on the entire strip $M$.\n\nE. Because the Möbius strip $M$ is a compact metric space, it is a normal space.
