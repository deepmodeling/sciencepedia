Consider the Klein bottle, $K$, equipped with its standard CW complex structure. This structure is built as follows:\n1.  Start with a 0-skeleton, $K^0$, consisting of a single point (a 0-cell), which we will call $v_0$.\n2.  Construct the 1-skeleton, $K^1$, by attaching the boundaries of two 1-cells, denoted $a$ and $b$, to the point $v_0$. Topologically, $K^1$ is a wedge of two circles.\n3.  Construct the 2-skeleton, $K^2$, by attaching a single 2-cell, $F$, to $K^1$. The attaching map glues the boundary of $F$ to the path in $K^1$ represented by the word $aba^{-1}b$.

With the standard CW structures, the domain has a single $0$-cell and a single $1$-cell, so $S^{1}=S^{1,1}$ and $S^{1,0}$ is a single point. The map $g$ is cellular if and only if it satisfies $g(S^{1,0})\\subset K^{0}$ and $g(S^{1,1})\\subset K^{1}$. Since $K^{0}=\\{v_{0}\\}$ and $S^{1}=S^{1,1}$, it follows that $g(S^{1})\\subset K^{1}$ and in fact $v_{0}\\in g(S^{1})$ because the unique $0$-cell maps to $v_{0}$. Therefore $g(S^{1})$ can never be the entire Klein bottle $K$; it must lie in its $1$-skeleton $K^{1}$.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is impossible because $g(S^{1})\\subset K^{1}\\subsetneq K$. B (and equivalently F, since the union of the two loops $a$ and $b$ is precisely $K^{1}$) is too strong: a cellular map need not surject onto $K^{1}$; for example, a constant map has image $\\{v_{0}\\}$, and a map factoring through one circle gives image equal to that single loop. D is too restrictive because images of continuous maps $S^{1}\\to K^{1}$ need not be embedded circles; they can be $\\{v_{0}\\}$, a single loop, a closed arc containing $v_{0}$, or even all of $K^{1}$, none of which uniformly forces the image to be homeomorphic to $S^{1}$. E is also too restrictive, as nonconstant cellular maps exist.\n\nThe correct general description is that $g(S^{1})$ is some image of a continuous map from $S^{1}$ into $K^{1}$. Every cellular map $g$ is a continuous map landing in $K^{1}$, so its image is included among the images described in C. Conversely, any continuous map $h:S^{1}\\to K^{1}$ that sends the unique $0$-cell of $S^{1}$ to $v_{0}$ is already cellular, so every such image occurs.
