For any space $X$, the suspension $S(X)$ is the quotient of $X \\times [-1,1]$ that identifies all points in $X \\times \\{1\\}$ to a single point (the north pole) and all points in $X \\times \\{-1\\}$ to a single point (the south pole).

Then\n$$\nY \\times [-1,1] = \\left(S^{1} \\times [-1,1]\\right) \\sqcup \\left(S^{1} \\times [-1,1]\\right).\n$$\nUnder the suspension identification, every point in $Y \\times \\{1\\}$ is identified to a single common north pole $N$, and every point in $Y \\times \\{-1\\}$ is identified to a single common south pole $S$. Therefore, each component $S^{1} \\times [-1,1]$ becomes a suspension of $S^{1}$, which is homeomorphic to $S^{2}$, with poles $N$ and $S$. Because the identification of the top and bottom is performed globally across both components, the two resulting $S^{2}$'s share the same two poles $N$ and $S$.\n\nHence $S(S^{1} \\sqcup S^{1})$ is the union of two $S^{2}$'s attached at exactly the two points $N$ and $S$. This is not a wedge sum $S^{2} \\lor S^{2}$, which would identify a single point only, and it is not a disjoint union, because the two spheres meet at the two common poles. It is also not a torus.\n\nA homological check via the Mayer–Vietoris sequence confirms this description. If $A$ and $B$ denote the two $S^{2}$'s and $A \\cap B = \\{N,S\\} \\cong S^{0}$, then $\\tilde{H}_{2}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\tilde{H}_{2}(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\tilde{H}_{1}(A \\cap B) = 0$, $\\tilde{H}_{0}(A \\cap B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.

If $X$ is path-connected, then $SX$ is simply connected. Consider the open cover of $SX$ by the images under the quotient of $X \\times (0,\\frac{3}{5})$ and $X \\times (\\frac{2}{5},1)$; call these $U$ and $V$. Each of $U$ and $V$ deformation retracts onto a cone on $X$, hence each is contractible, so $\\pi_{1}(U)=\\pi_{1}(V)=0$. Their intersection $U \\cap V$ deformation retracts onto $X \\times (\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{3}{5})$, which deformation retracts onto $X$, and is path-connected because $X$ is path-connected. By the van Kampen theorem,\n$$\n\\pi_{1}(SX) \\cong \\pi_{1}(U) *_{\\pi_{1}(U \\cap V)} \\pi_{1}(V) \\cong 0 *_{\\pi_{1}(X)} 0 \\cong 0.\n$$\nThus $SX$ is simply connected. Statement A is true.\n\nB. If $X$ is contractible, then $SX$ is homeomorphic to a sphere $S^{n}$ for some $n$. This is false in general. A counterexample is $X$ a single point. Then $X \\times [0,1]$ is homeomorphic to $[0,1]$, and collapsing the top and bottom faces does nothing beyond naming the endpoints, so\n$$\nS(\\{\\text{pt}\\}) \\cong [0,1],\n$$\nwhich is not homeomorphic to any $S^{n}$. Therefore B is false.\n\nC. If $X$ is a discrete space with exactly two points, then $SX$ is connected but not path-connected. Let $X=\\{a,b\\}$ with the discrete topology. Then $SX$ is obtained by taking two line segments from the south pole to the north pole, corresponding to $\\{a\\}\\times[0,1]$ and $\\{b\\}\\times[0,1]$, and gluing their endpoints. The resulting space is homeomorphic to $S^{1}$, which is path-connected. Hence the claim “connected but not path-connected” is false. Therefore C is false.\n\nD. If $X$ is contractible, then $SX$ is contractible. Let $h: X \\times [0,1] \\to X$ be a contraction of $X$ to a point $x_{0}$, so $h(x,0)=x$ and $h(x,1)=x_{0}$. Define\n$$\nH: (X \\times [0,1]) \\times [0,1] \\to X \\times [0,1],\\quad H((x,t),s) = (h(x,s), t).\n$$\nThis descends to a well-defined homotopy $\\widetilde{H}: SX \\times [0,1] \\to SX$ because at $t=0$ or $t=1$ the entire face is collapsed to a single point, independent of $x$. We have $\\widetilde{H}(-,0)=\\text{id}_{SX}$ and $\\widetilde{H}(-,1)$ maps all of $SX$ into the image of $\\{x_{0}\\}\\times [0,1]$, which is homeomorphic to an interval, hence contractible. Composing with a further homotopy that linearly collapses this interval to, say, the south pole gives a contraction of $SX$ to a point. Thus $SX$ is contractible. Alternatively, since $X \\simeq \\{\\text{pt}\\}$ and suspension preserves homotopy equivalences, $SX \\simeq S(\\{\\text{pt}\\}) \\cong [0,1]$, so $SX$ is contractible.
