For a path-connected space $X$, the first part of the theorem states that the first integral homology group, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$. This is expressed as:\n$$H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X, x_0)^{ab}$$\nThe abelianization of a group $G$, denoted $G^{ab}$, is the quotient group $G/[G, G]$, where $[G, G]$ is the commutator subgroup of $G$. If $G$ is given by a presentation $\\langle S \\mid R \\rangle$, where $S$ is a set of generators and $R$ is a set of relations, the presentation for $G^{ab}$ can be found by adding relations that force all generators to commute.\n\nThe fundamental theorem for finitely generated abelian groups states that any such group $A$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form:\n$$A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$$\nwhere $T$ is the torsion subgroup (a direct sum of finite cyclic groups) and $r$ is a non-negative integer called the **free rank** of the group $A$.
