Consider the group action of $G$ on $X$ defined by $g \\cdot x = x + g$ for all $g \\in G$ and $x \\in X$.\n\nWe recall the following definitions for an action of a group $G$ on a topological space $X$:\n1.  The action is **free** if for any $g \\in G$ other than the identity element, the action of $g$ has no fixed points.
