A *knot diagram* is a two-dimensional projection of a knot onto a plane, where any points where the string crosses itself are called *crossings*. At each crossing, a break in the lower strand indicates which part of the string is passing underneath. Two knots are considered equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or passing the string through itself. The simplest knot, which is equivalent to a simple circle, is called the *unknot*. The minimum number of crossings required to represent a given knot in any diagram is called its *crossing number*.\n\nConsider a knot diagram that is constructed with exactly two crossings.

The existence of a two-crossing knot diagram is a mathematical impossibility.", "solution": "We are given a knot diagram with exactly two crossings. Let the represented knot be denoted by $K$, and let $c(K)$ be its crossing number, defined as the minimal number of crossings over all diagrams representing $K$. By definition of crossing number applied to any specific diagram,\n$$\nc(K) \\leq 2.\n$$\n\nWe show that no nontrivial knot has crossing number $1$ or $2$, hence any two-crossing knot diagram necessarily represents the unknot.\n\n1) Excluding $c(K)=1$: If a knot diagram has exactly one crossing, that crossing is removable by a Reidemeister I move, yielding a diagram with $0$ crossings, which represents the unknot. Therefore no knot has $c(K)=1$; any such diagram is reducible to the unknot, implying $c(K)=0$.\n\n2) Excluding $c(K)=2$ for a knot: Consider a two-crossing single-component diagram. The underlying planar $4$-valent graph has $V=2$ vertices and $E=4$ edges. By Euler’s formula for a connected planar graph on the sphere,\n$$\nV - E + F = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2 - 4 + F = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad F = 4.\n$$\nWith two vertices and four edges connecting them, there is necessarily a bigon face (a $2$-gon) bounded by two arcs running between the same crossings. In a knot diagram, the presence of such a bigon corresponds to a pair of crossings that can be eliminated by a Reidemeister II move, reducing the crossing number by $2$ and producing a $0$-crossing diagram. Thus a two-crossing knot diagram cannot be minimal; no knot has $c(K)=2$.\n\nCombining these, the only possibility consistent with $c(K) \\leq 2$ is\n$$\nc(K) = 0,\n$$\nwhich is the unknot.\n\nTherefore, any knot diagram with exactly two crossings necessarily represents the unknot. In particular: the trefoil has crossing number $3$, so it cannot be represented with two crossings; the figure-eight knot has crossing number $4$, so it also cannot be represented with two crossings; the existence of a two-crossing knot diagram is not impossible, but it is always reducible to the unknot.\n\nHence the necessarily true statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1659441"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify the unknot, a natural question arises: how can a complex knot be simplified into an unknot? This practice focuses on the figure-eight knot and the powerful effect of a single \"crossing change\"—a local modification with profound topological consequences. This exploration provides insight into a knot invariant known as the unknotting number and reveals surprising properties of a special class of knots called alternating knots [@problem_id:1659438].", "problem": "In knot theory, a knot is a closed loop in 3D space that does not intersect itself. A knot diagram is a 2D projection of the knot onto a plane, with breaks at the crossings to indicate which strand goes over and which goes under. A 'crossing change' is the local operation of switching the over-strand and the under-strand at a single crossing. The 'unknot' is a knot that is equivalent to a simple, un-knotted circle; any diagram of the unknot can be simplified to a circle using a series of deformations called Reidemeister moves.\n\nConsider the standard minimal projection of the figure-eight knot ($4_1$). We can provide a consistent labeling for its four crossings by performing a continuous trace of the knot's path. Imagine tracing the entire loop, starting from the uppermost horizontal segment and moving from left to right.\n\n1.  The path first arrives at a crossing where it passes **under** an intersecting segment. We label this crossing $C_1$.\n2.  Continuing along, the path forms the right-hand lobe of the diagram and returns toward the center, where it arrives at a second crossing. Here, the path goes **over** the intersecting segment. We label this crossing $C_2$.\n3.  The path then continues to form the left-hand lobe and arrives at a third crossing, where it passes **under** the intersecting segment. We label this crossing $C_3$.\n4.  Finally, to complete the loop, the path arrives at a fourth crossing, where it goes **over** the intersecting segment before connecting back to the starting point.

It is not possible to transform the figure-eight knot into the unknot by changing a single crossing in this diagram.", "solution": "We begin with the standard minimal diagram of the figure-eight knot, which is a reduced alternating knot diagram with exactly $4$ crossings. Let $c(K)$ denote the minimal crossing number of a knot $K$. For the figure-eight knot $K$, we have $c(K)=4$.\n\nConsider performing a single crossing change at any one of the labeled crossings $C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4}$. This produces a new knot diagram $D'$ of some knot $K'$. A crossing change does not alter the number of components, so $K'$ is still a knot (one component).\n\nWe now use the following standard fact about reduced alternating diagrams: changing a single crossing in a reduced alternating diagram yields a diagram whose minimal crossing number is at most two fewer than the original. Concretely, if the original diagram has $c$ crossings and is reduced alternating, then after one crossing change the resulting knot or link satisfies\n$$\nc(K') \\leq c - 2.\n$$\nApplying this with $c=4$ gives\n$$\nc(K') \\leq 2.\n$$\n\nSince $K'$ is a knot (one component), we rule out the possibilities $c(K')=1$ and $c(K')=2$:\n- There is no knot with minimal crossing number $1$, because any $1$-crossing diagram is reducible by a Reidemeister I move to $0$ crossings; thus the minimal crossing number cannot be $1$.\n- There is no knot with minimal crossing number $2$; the unique reduced alternating $2$-crossing diagram represents the Hopf link, which has two components.\n\nTherefore the only remaining possibility compatible with $c(K') \\leq 2$ and one component is\n$$\nc(K') = 0,\n$$\nwhich means $K'$ is the unknot.\n\nThis argument does not depend on which specific crossing is changed, only on the facts that the original diagram is reduced alternating with $4$ crossings and that a single crossing change was performed. Hence changing the crossing at any of $C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4}$ yields the unknot.

A knot is $n$-colorable if the system of linear congruences governing its coloring has a non-trivial solution, meaning a solution where not all arc colors are the same.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of congruences in a standard form, $A\\mathbf{c} \\equiv \\mathbf{0} \\pmod n$.\n1. $c_1 - 2c_2 + c_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$\n2. $-2c_1 + c_3 + c_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$\n3. $c_2 - 2c_3 + c_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$\n4. $c_1 + c_2 - 2c_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$\n\nThis system can be expressed in matrix form as $M\\mathbf{c} \\equiv \\mathbf{0} \\pmod n$, where $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4)^T$ is the vector of colors and $M$ is the coefficient matrix:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-2 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA non-trivial solution for $\\mathbf{c}$ modulo $n$ exists if and only if the system allows for solutions other than the trivial one where $c_1=c_2=c_3=c_4=k$ for some constant $k$. A trivial coloring always satisfies the system, as for any equation of the form $a+b \\equiv 2c \\pmod n$, substituting $a=b=c=k$ gives $k+k \\equiv 2k \\pmod n$, which is always true.\n\nThe existence of a non-trivial solution to this homogeneous system of linear congruences is related to the determinant of the matrix $M$. A non-trivial solution over the rational numbers exists if and only if $\\det(M) = 0$. Let's examine the matrix $M$.

This confirms the existence of the trivial solution vector $(1,1,1,1)^T$, but doesn't yet give the condition on $n$.\n\nFor a knot coloring matrix, the condition for $n$-colorability is determined by the so-called *determinant of the knot*.
