Seifert's algorithm is a constructive method to build such a surface from a given knot diagram. The first step of the algorithm is to apply an orientation to the knot. Then, at each crossing, the crossing is \"smoothed out\" by rerouting the strands in a way that respects the chosen orientation, thus eliminating the crossing locally. This procedure transforms the knot diagram into a collection of disjoint, non-intersecting closed curves in the plane. These curves are known as Seifert circles. The Seifert surface is then constructed from disks bounded by these circles, connected by half-twisted bands corresponding to the original crossings.\n\nApply this procedure to the standard alternating diagram of the figure-eight knot (also known as knot $4_1$).

This produces a collection of disjoint simple closed curves, the Seifert circles. In the standard alternating diagram of $4_1$, performing this oriented smoothing yields exactly $s=3$ Seifert circles (one can verify by direct smoothing that the smoothed arcs close into three disjoint circles).\n\nEach original crossing contributes one half-twisted band in the Seifert surface construction. Therefore, the number of bands equals the number of crossings:\n$$\nb=c=4.\n$$\n\nAs a consistency check via Euler characteristic, the Seifert surface is built from $s$ disks (0-handles) and $b$ bands (1-handles), so its Euler characteristic is\n$$\n\\chi = s - b.\n$$\nFor a connected orientable surface with one boundary component (a knot), we also have\n$$\n\\chi = 1 - 2g,\n$$\nso\n$$\ng = \\frac{b - s + 1}{2}.\n$$\nIt is known that the figure-eight knot has genus $g=1$, and for alternating diagrams Seifert’s algorithm attains minimal genus.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  Start with an oriented link diagram projected onto a plane.\n2.  At each crossing, resolve the crossing by \"smoothing\" it out. This is done by detaching the four arcs at the crossing and reattaching them in the unique way that respects the orientation of the original strands but eliminates the crossing itself. This procedure transforms the original link diagram into a set of disjoint, oriented, simple closed curves in the plane. These are known as Seifert circles.\n3.  For each Seifert circle, imagine it as the boundary of a disk. We now have a collection of disjoint disks.\n4.  For each crossing in the original link diagram, re-establish a connection by adding a single half-twisted band. This band connects the disk(s) whose Seifert circle(s) passed through the location of that original crossing.

For the Hopf link, the smoothing produces two disjoint, oriented, simple closed curves. Hence the number of Seifert circles is $s=2$.\n\n2) Replace each Seifert circle by a disk. This yields two disjoint disks. The Euler characteristic at this stage is the sum of the Euler characteristics of the disks:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\text{disks}} = s = 2.\n$$\n\n3) For each original crossing, attach one half-twisted band between the disks that correspond to the Seifert circles passing through that crossing. There are $c=2$ crossings, hence two bands are attached. Each band attachment reduces the Euler characteristic by $1$ and preserves orientability. Therefore the Euler characteristic of the resulting surface is\n$$\n\\chi = s - c = 2 - 2 = 0.\n$$\nBecause the two bands connect the two disks, the resulting surface is connected.\n\n4) The boundary of the constructed surface is exactly the original link, so the boundary has $b=2$ components.

It is a surprising fact that a particular choice of a knot diagram can result in a Seifert surface that is more complex than necessary. For instance, a diagram of the unknot (a knot that can be deformed into a simple circle) might produce a surface with a non-zero genus.\n\nConsider a knot diagram that visually resembles a three-leaf clover. To trace the knot, one can follow its single continuous strand. As you traverse the path of the knot, you will encounter three crossings, which we can label $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ in the order you meet them. The nature of these crossings is as follows:\n- At crossing $C_1$, the strand you are following passes **over** the other part of the strand it intersects.\n- At crossing $C_2$, the strand you are following again passes **over** the other part of the strand.\n- At crossing $C_3$, the strand you are following passes **under** the other part of the strand.\n\nYou are given that this specific knot diagram, despite its appearance, is a diagram of the unknot.

The oriented smoothing depends only on the orientation of the underlying immersed curve (the shadow), not on which strand is over or under at each crossing. The described diagram has the three-crossing “three-leaf clover” shadow; with a consistent orientation along the single component, performing the orientation-preserving smoothing at all three intersections produces exactly two disjoint Seifert circles.
