The key insight is that the result of this map, $\\alpha \\cup \\beta$, must be an element of the codomain, $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, our first step is to determine the structure of this group.\n\nWe can compute the cohomology groups of $X = S^1 \\vee S^1$ using cellular cohomology. We can give $X$ a CW complex structure with one 0-cell, let's call it $v$, and two 1-cells, let's call them $a$ and $b$. There are no cells of dimension 2 or higher. The cellular chain complex for $X$ is therefore:\n$$ \\dots \\to C_2(X) \\to C_1(X) \\to C_0(X) \\to 0 $$\nWith this CW structure, the chain groups are:\n$C_0(X) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle v \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n$C_1(X) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle a \\rangle \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\langle b \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$\n$C_n(X) = 0$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n\nThe boundary maps are denoted by $d_n: C_n(X) \\to C_{n-1}(X)$.\nThe map $d_1: C_1(X) \\to C_0(X)$ is determined by where it sends the generators $a$ and $b$. Each 1-cell is a loop that starts and ends at the 0-cell $v$. The boundary of a 1-cell is the difference of its endpoints. Thus, $d_1(a) = v - v = 0$ and $d_1(b) = v - v = 0$. So, the map $d_1$ is the zero map.\nThe map $d_2: C_2(X) \\to C_1(X)$ must be the zero map because its domain, $C_2(X)$, is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$.\n\nThe homology groups $H_n(X)$ are given by $H_n(X) = \\ker(d_n) / \\text{im}(d_{n+1})$.\n$H_0(X) = \\ker(d_0) / \\text{im}(d_1)$. Since $X$ is path-connected and $d_1=0$, $H_0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$H_1(X) = \\ker(d_1) / \\text{im}(d_2)$. We have $\\ker(d_1) = C_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\\text{im}(d_2) = 0$. So, $H_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n$H_2(X) = \\ker(d_2) / \\text{im}(d_3)$. We have $\\ker(d_2) = C_2(X) = 0$. So, $H_2(X) = 0$.\n\nNow we find the cohomology groups $H^n(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. We can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for Cohomology, which gives a short exact sequence:\n$$ 0 \\to \\text{Ext}_\\mathbb{Z}^1(H_{n-1}(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^n(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_n(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 $$\nWe are interested in $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, so we set $n=2$:\n$$ 0 \\to \\text{Ext}_\\mathbb{Z}^1(H_1(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_2(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 $$\nWe substitute the homology groups we calculated:\n$H_1(X) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$\n$H_2(X) = 0$\n\nThe Ext functor $\\text{Ext}_\\mathbb{Z}^1(A, G)$ vanishes if $A$ is a free abelian group. Since $H_1(X) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ is a free abelian group, we have $\\text{Ext}_\\mathbb{Z}^1(H_1(X), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Ext}_\\mathbb{Z}^1(\\mathbb{Z}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\nThe Hom functor $\\text{Hom}(A, G)$ gives the group of homomorphisms from $A$ to $G$. Since $H_2(X) = 0$, the only homomorphism from the trivial group to any group is the trivial one, so $\\text{Hom}(H_2(X), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(0, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the short exact sequence:\n$$ 0 \\to 0 \\to H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 \\to 0 $$\nFor this sequence to be exact, the middle group must be trivial. Therefore, $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nThe cup product $\\alpha \\cup \\beta$ of two classes $\\alpha, \\beta \\in H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ must be an element of $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the trivial group containing only the zero element, the result of the cup product must always be zero, regardless of the choice of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nThis confirms that statement A is correct.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other options.\nOption B is incorrect. It describes the behavior of the cup product on the 2-torus $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$, not the wedge sum $S^1 \\vee S^1$. For the torus, $H^1(T^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $H^2(T^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and the cup product of the two generators of $H^1$ is a generator of $H^2$. This is a common point of confusion.\nOption C is incorrect because it claims the product is non-zero for non-zero classes. This would mean the cohomology ring (with the cup product) has no zero divisors in degree 1, which is false as we have shown all products are zero.\nOption D is incorrect because it asserts that $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which we have proven to be false.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1679507"}]}
