We will compute the two terms $\\alpha \\wedge \\beta$ and $\\beta \\wedge \\alpha$ separately and then add them.\n\nFirst, let's compute $\\alpha \\wedge \\beta$. We use the distributive property of the wedge product:\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = (2 dx - 3 dz) \\wedge (5 dx \\wedge dy - 7 dy \\wedge dz) $$\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = (2 dx) \\wedge (5 dx \\wedge dy) - (2 dx) \\wedge (7 dy \\wedge dz) - (3 dz) \\wedge (5 dx \\wedge dy) + (3 dz) \\wedge (7 dy \\wedge dz) $$\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = 10 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) - 14 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) - 15 \\cdot (dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) + 21 \\cdot (dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) $$\nA fundamental property of the wedge product is that for any 1-form $\\omega$, we have $\\omega \\wedge \\omega = 0$.

The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = - 14 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) - 15 \\cdot (dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) $$\nTo combine these terms, we must express $dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$ in the standard basis $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. We use the anti-commutativity property of basis 1-forms ($du \\wedge dv = -dv \\wedge du$):\n$$ dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = -(dx \\wedge dz \\wedge dy) = + (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\alpha \\wedge \\beta$:\n$$ \\alpha \\wedge \\beta = - 14 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) - 15 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) = (-14 - 15) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = -29 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz $$\n\nNext, let's compute $\\beta \\wedge \\alpha$:\n$$ \\beta \\wedge \\alpha = (5 dx \\wedge dy - 7 dy \\wedge dz) \\wedge (2 dx - 3 dz) $$\n$$ \\beta \\wedge \\alpha = (5 dx \\wedge dy) \\wedge (2 dx) - (5 dx \\wedge dy) \\wedge (3 dz) - (7 dy \\wedge dz) \\wedge (2 dx) + (7 dy \\wedge dz) \\wedge (3 dz) $$\n$$ \\beta \\wedge \\alpha = 10 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dx) - 15 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) - 14 \\cdot (dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx) + 21 \\cdot (dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dz) $$\nAgain, terms with repeated basis 1-forms are zero: $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dx = 0$ and $dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dz = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\beta \\wedge \\alpha = - 15 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) - 14 \\cdot (dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx) $$\nWe reorder the basis form $dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$:\n$$ dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = -(dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz) = + (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) $$\nSubstituting this in:\n$$ \\beta \\wedge \\alpha = - 15 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) - 14 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) = (-15 - 14) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = -29 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz $$\nNotice that $\\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\beta \\wedge \\alpha$.

The degree of $\\alpha$ is given as a positive odd integer, let's call it $k$. We want to find the possible additive orders for the element $\\alpha^2 = \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha$.\n\nFirst, we apply the graded-commutativity rule to the product of $\\alpha$ with itself. The rule is $xy = (-1)^{\\deg(x)\\deg(y)} yx$ for homogeneous elements $x$ and $y$. Let $x = \\alpha$ and $y = \\alpha$. The degree of both is $k$.\nSo, we have:\n$$ \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha = (-1)^{k \\cdot k} \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha $$\n$$ \\alpha^2 = (-1)^{k^2} \\alpha^2 $$\nThe problem states that $k$ is a positive odd integer. If $k$ is odd, its square $k^2$ is also odd. An odd integer can be written as $2m+1$ for some integer $m$. Then $k^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 2(2m^2+2m)+1$, which is clearly odd.\nTherefore, $(-1)^{k^2} = -1$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation, we get:\n$$ \\alpha^2 = - \\alpha^2 $$\nAdding $\\alpha^2$ to both sides of the equation gives:\n$$ \\alpha^2 + \\alpha^2 = 0 $$\n$$ 2\\alpha^2 = 0 $$\nThis equation tells us that twice the element $\\alpha^2$ is the zero element. According to the definition of additive order, the order of $\\alpha^2$ must be a divisor of 2. The positive divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. So, the only possible additive orders for $\\alpha^2$ are 1 or 2. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nNow, we need to determine if both 1 and 2 are actually possible. We can do this by constructing examples.\n\nCase 1: Can the additive order be 1?\nThe additive order of an element is 1 if and only if the element itself is the zero element. So, we need to check if it's possible for $\\alpha^2$ to be zero.\nConsider the exterior algebra on a single generator over $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. Let the generator be $x$ with degree 1. The algebra is $A = (\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z})[x] / (x^2)$. The components are $A_0 = \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\cdot 1$, $A_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\cdot x$, and $A_k=0$ for $k \\geq 2$. This algebra is graded-commutative.\nLet's choose $\\alpha = x$. Its degree is 1, which is odd. Then $\\alpha^2 = x^2 = 0$ by definition of this algebra. The additive order of the zero element is 1. Therefore, 1 is a possible additive order. This confirms option A is possible.\n\nCase 2: Can the additive order be 2?\nFor the additive order to be 2, we must have $\\alpha^2 \\neq 0$ and $2\\alpha^2 = 0$. We have already shown that $2\\alpha^2=0$ is a necessary consequence of the setup. So we only need to show that it is possible for $\\alpha^2$ to be non-zero.\nLet's construct a suitable graded algebra. Let $k$ be a positive odd integer.\nLet $A_0 = \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet $A_k = \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\cdot \\alpha$ be a free module of rank 1 generated by a formal symbol $\\alpha$.\nLet $A_{2k} = \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\cdot \\beta$ be a free module of rank 1 generated by a formal symbol $\\beta$.\nLet all other graded components $A_j$ be the zero module.\nThe total algebra is $A = A_0 \\oplus A_k \\oplus A_{2k}$.\nWe must define a multiplication that makes $A$ a graded-commutative algebra. Let's define the only non-trivial product between elements of positive degree as follows:\n$$ \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha = 3\\beta $$\nThis definition respects the grading, as $\\deg(\\alpha \\cdot \\alpha) = k+k=2k = \\deg(\\beta)$.\nWe must check if it is graded-commutative. The relation $\\alpha^2 = -\\alpha^2$ must hold. This means we must check if $2\\alpha^2=0$ is true with our definition.\n$2\\alpha^2 = 2(3\\beta) = (2 \\cdot 3)\\beta = 6\\beta$.\nSince $A$ is an algebra over $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, multiplication by any integer is understood as multiplication by that integer modulo 6. Since $6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$, we have $6\\beta = 0 \\cdot \\beta = 0$.\nSo the relation $2\\alpha^2 = 0$ is satisfied.\nNow we find the additive order of $\\alpha^2 = 3\\beta$. Since $\\beta$ is a generator of a free module, $c\\beta=0$ if and only if $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\nThe element $\\alpha^2 = 3\\beta$ is not zero, because $3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\nThe additive order of $3\\beta$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n(3\\beta) = 0$. This implies $(n \\cdot 3)\\beta = 0$, which requires $n \\cdot 3$ to be a multiple of 6.\nFor $n=1$: $1 \\cdot 3 = 3$, not a multiple of 6. So the order is not 1.\nFor $n=2$: $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$, which is a multiple of 6.\nThe smallest such positive integer $n$ is 2. Thus, the additive order of $\\alpha^2$ in this example is 2. Therefore, 2 is also a possible additive order. This confirms option B is possible.\n\nIn summary, the additive order of $\\alpha^2$ must be a divisor of 2, and we have constructed examples showing that both 1 and 2 are possible. Therefore, the possible additive orders are 1 and 2.\nThe correct options are A and B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1653051"}]}
