By constructing and analyzing this graph, you can determine the rank of an algebraically-defined subgroup using the very same topological formula, beautifully illustrating the deep interplay between algebra and topology.", "problem": "**Background**\n\nA finitely generated subgroup $H$ of a free group $F_n = \\langle x_1, \\dots, x_n \\rangle$ is itself a free group. The rank of $H$ is the size of a minimal generating set (a basis) for $H$. A powerful tool for studying such subgroups is the Stallings automaton, also known as a Stallings graph.\n\nGiven a set of generators $S = \\{w_1, \\dots, w_k\\}$ for a subgroup $H = \\langle S \\rangle \\subseteq F_n$, its Stallings automaton $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ is a directed graph with edges labeled by the generators of $F_n$. It is constructed via a \"folding\" process:\n\n1.  **Flower Automaton:** Begin with a graph consisting of a single basepoint vertex, $v_0$. For each generator $w_i \\in S$, add a loop at $v_0$ representing $w_i$. This loop is a path of directed edges starting and ending at $v_0$, where the edge labels spell out the word $w_i$. New intermediate vertices are introduced along each path. An inverse letter, like $x_j^{-1}$, corresponds to traversing an edge labeled $x_j$ in the reverse direction.\n\n2.  **Folding:** The graph is iteratively \"folded\". If two distinct edges with the same label either start at the same vertex or end at the same vertex, these edges are merged by identifying their respective endpoints or startpoints. This process is repeated until no such identifications are possible. The resulting graph is the reduced Stallings automaton $\\mathcal{A}(H)$. A key property of this folded graph is that for any vertex $v$ and any generator $x_j \\in \\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$, there is at most one edge labeled $x_j$ leaving $v$ and at most one entering $v$.\n\n3.  **Rank Calculation:** The subgroup $H$ consists of all words that label closed paths in $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ starting and ending at the basepoint $v_0$. The rank of the subgroup $H$ is equal to the rank of the fundamental group of its Stallings automaton, $\\pi_1(\\mathcal{A}(H))$. For a connected graph $\\Gamma=(V, E)$, this rank is given by the formula for its first Betti number:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(H) = |E| - |V| + 1 $$\n    where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $|E|$ is the number of edges in $\\mathcal{A}(H)$.\n\n**Problem**\n\nConsider the free group on two generators, $F_2 = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. Let $H$ be the subgroup generated by the set of words $S = \\{a^3, b^2, aba^{-1}\\}$.\n\nYour task is to derive the rank of the subgroup $H$. To do this, you must first construct the corresponding Stallings automaton $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ by starting with the flower automaton and applying the folding procedure until the graph is fully reduced. Then, use the topological formula to calculate the rank.", "solution": "The subgroup $H$ of $F_2 = \\langle a, b \\rangle$ is generated by $S = \\{a^3, b^2, aba^{-1}\\}$. We will find the rank of $H$ by constructing its Stallings automaton.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Flower Automaton**\n\nWe start with a basepoint $v_0$. For each generator in $S$, we add a corresponding loop at $v_0$.\n\n1.  For $w_1 = a^3 = aaa$: We create a path $v_0 \\xrightarrow{a} v_1 \\xrightarrow{a} v_2 \\xrightarrow{a} v_0$. This adds two new vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$, and three edges.\n2.  For $w_2 = b^2 = bb$: We create a path $v_0 \\xrightarrow{b} v_3 \\xrightarrow{b} v_0$. This adds one new vertex, $v_3$, and two edges.\n3.  For $w_3 = aba^{-1}$: We create a path $v_0 \\xrightarrow{a} v_4 \\xrightarrow{b} v_5$. The final $a^{-1}$ means we traverse an $a$-labeled edge backwards to return to $v_0$. This requires an edge that starts at $v_0$ and ends at $v_5$. For the construction of the automaton, we draw this as a directed edge $v_0 \\xrightarrow{a} v_5$. Therefore, the path corresponding to $aba^{-1}$ is $v_0 \\xrightarrow{a} v_4 \\xrightarrow{b} v_5$, and the loop is closed by reading $a^{-1}$ from $v_5$ to $v_0$ along the edge $(v_0, a, v_5)$.\n\nThe initial graph (the flower automaton) has vertices $V_{initial} = \\{v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ and edges corresponding to the paths above.\n\n**Step 2: Fold the Automaton**\n\nWe fold the graph by identifying vertices connected by identically labeled edges.\n\n1.  **First fold:** The basepoint $v_0$ has three outgoing edges labeled 'a':\n    -   $(v_0, a, v_1)$ from the $a^3$ loop.\n    -   $(v_0, a, v_4)$ from the $aba^{-1}$ loop.\n    -   $(v_0, a, v_5)$ from the $aba^{-1}$ loop.\n    To make the automaton deterministic for outgoing 'a' edges from $v_0$, we must identify the target vertices $v_1$, $v_4$, and $v_5$. Let's call the new merged vertex $V_A = \\{v_1, v_4, v_5\\}$.\n\n2.  **Update the graph after the first fold:**\n    The vertices are now $\\{v_0, V_A, v_2, v_3\\}$. Let's trace the edges:\n    -   The three 'a' edges from $v_0$ merge into a single edge: $(v_0, a, V_A)$.\n    -   The edge $(v_1, a, v_2)$ becomes $(V_A, a, v_2)$.\n    -   The edge $(v_2, a, v_0)$ remains unchanged.\n    -   The edges for $b^2$, $(v_0, b, v_3)$ and $(v_3, b, v_0)$, remain unchanged.\n    -   The edge $(v_4, b, v_5)$ becomes $(V_A, b, V_A)$, which is a loop at vertex $V_A$.\n\n    The current set of edges is:\n    -   $e_1: v_0 \\xrightarrow{a} V_A$\n    -   $e_2: V_A \\xrightarrow{a} v_2$\n    -   $e_3: v_2 \\xrightarrow{a} v_0$\n    -   $e_4: v_0 \\xrightarrow{b} v_3$\n    -   $e_5: v_3 \\xrightarrow{b} v_0$\n    -   $e_6: V_A \\xrightarrow{b} V_A$\n\n3.  **Check for further folds:**\n    We check if any vertex has multiple outgoing or incoming edges with the same label.\n    -   **Outgoing edges:**\n        -   From $v_0$: one 'a' edge, one 'b' edge. OK.\n        -   From $V_A$: one 'a' edge, one 'b' edge. OK.\n        -   From $v_2$: one 'a' edge. OK.\n        -   From $v_3$: one 'b' edge. OK.\n    -   **Incoming edges:**\n        -   To $v_0$: one 'a' edge (from $v_2$), one 'b' edge (from $v_3$). OK.\n        -   To $V_A$: one 'a' edge (from $v_0$), one 'b' edge (from $V_A$). OK.\n        -   To $v_2$: one 'a' edge (from $V_A$). OK.\n        -   To $v_3$: one 'b' edge (from $v_0$). OK.\n\nThe graph is now fully folded. This is the Stallings automaton $\\mathcal{A}(H)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Rank**\n\nWe use the formula $\\text{rank}(H) = |E| - |V| + 1$.\n-   The set of vertices is $V = \\{v_0, V_A, v_2, v_3\\}$. So, $|V| = 4$.\n-   The set of edges is $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ as listed above. So, $|E| = 6$.\n\nThe graph is connected, as all vertices are reachable from the basepoint $v_0$.\nThe rank of the subgroup $H$ is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(H) = |E| - |V| + 1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3 $$\nThis implies that the original set of generators $\\{a^3, b^2, aba^{-1}\\}$ is a free basis for the subgroup $H$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3} $$", "id": "955759"}]}
