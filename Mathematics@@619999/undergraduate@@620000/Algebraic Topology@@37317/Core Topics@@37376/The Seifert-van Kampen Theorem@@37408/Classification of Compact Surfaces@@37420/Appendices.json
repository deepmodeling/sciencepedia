An edge labeled `x` is oriented in one direction, while `x^{-1}` denotes the same edge oriented in the opposite direction. Identifying edges means these labeled pairs are glued together respecting their orientation.\n\nA primary tool for classifying these surfaces is the simplification of their boundary words. The most fundamental rule of simplification states that any adjacent pair of labels of the form $xx^{-1}$ or $x^{-1}x$ can be removed from the word.
