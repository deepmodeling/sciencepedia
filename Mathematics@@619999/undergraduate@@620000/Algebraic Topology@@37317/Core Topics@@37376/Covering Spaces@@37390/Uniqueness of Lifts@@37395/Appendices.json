The derivative of the map, $p'(z)$, is not defined at $z=0$.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the specific reason why the uniqueness of path lifting fails for the map $p(z) = z^k$ and a path starting at the origin. The core of the issue lies in the failure of $p: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ to be a covering map. Let's analyze the properties of this map in the context of the Path Lifting Theorem.\n\nThe Path Lifting Theorem states that for a covering map $p: E \\to B$, any path $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to B$, and any point $e_0 \\in E$ such that $p(e_0) = \\gamma(0)$, there exists a unique continuous path $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0, 1] \\to E$ such that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = e_0$ and $p \\circ \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$.\n\nThe crucial hypothesis here is that $p$ must be a covering map. A continuous surjective map $p: E \\to B$ is a covering map if every point $b \\in B$ has an open neighborhood $U$, called an evenly covered neighborhood, such that the preimage $p^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in $E$, say $p^{-1}(U) = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} V_i$, where the restriction of $p$ to each $V_i$, denoted $p|_{V_i}: V_i \\to U$, is a homeomorphism.\n\nThe proof of the Path Lifting Theorem relies on this property. It constructs the lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ locally by covering the path $\\gamma$ with evenly covered neighborhoods and then piecing together the local lifts provided by the inverse of the homeomorphisms $p|_{V_i}$.\n\nLet's examine the map $p: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ with $p(z) = z^k$ for an integer $k > 1$. The base space and total space are both $\\mathbb{C}$. The path in question is $\\gamma(t) = t$, which starts at $\\gamma(0) = 0$.\n\nLet's check the covering map condition for different points in the base space $\\mathbb{C}$.\n1.  For any point $b \\neq 0$: We can choose a small open disk $U$ around $b$ that does not contain the origin. The preimage $p^{-1}(U)$ consists of $k$ disjoint open sets in $\\mathbb{C}$. On each of these sets, one can define a continuous branch of the $k$-th root function. The map $p$ restricted to each of these $k$ sets is a homeomorphism onto $U$. Thus, any point $b \\neq 0$ has an evenly covered neighborhood.\n\n2.  For the point $b = 0$: Let's consider any open neighborhood $U$ of $0$ in the base space. For simplicity, let $U$ be an open disk of radius $\\epsilon > 0$, i.e., $U = \\{w \\in \\mathbb{C} : |w| < \\epsilon\\}$. The preimage is $p^{-1}(U) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : p(z) \\in U\\} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z^k| < \\epsilon\\} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|^k < \\epsilon\\} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| < \\epsilon^{1/k}\\}$. This preimage is a single open disk of radius $\\epsilon^{1/k}$ centered at the origin in the total space. It is not a disjoint union of multiple open sets. Furthermore, the map $p$ restricted to this preimage disk is not a homeomorphism onto $U$. For example, every point $w \\in U \\setminus \\{0\\}$ has $k$ distinct preimages within the preimage disk, so the map is not injective, a necessary condition for a homeomorphism.\n\nSince the point $0$ in the base space does not have an evenly covered neighborhood, the map $p: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is not a covering map. The path $\\gamma$ starts at this \"bad\" point. The standard construction of a lift in the proof of the Path Lifting Theorem fails precisely at this first step, as there is no evenly covered neighborhood around $\\gamma(0)=0$ to begin the lifting process. This failure of a fundamental hypothesis is the reason for the non-uniqueness of lifts.\n\nTherefore, statement A is the correct answer.\n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n-   B. The total space $\\mathbb{C}$ is a metric space with the usual metric, and all metric spaces are Hausdorff. So, this statement is false.\n-   C. The concept of a deck transformation group is properly defined for covering maps. Since $p: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is not a covering map, discussing its deck transformation group is ill-posed. Even if we consider the associated covering map $p: \\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, its deck group is cyclic of order $k$, which is not free for $k>1$. However, this property relates to lifting loops in the punctured plane, not to the fundamental failure of the covering space definition at the origin.\n-   D. The map $p(z)=z^k$ is surjective onto $\\mathbb{C}$. For any $w \\in \\mathbb{C}$, its preimages are the $k$-th roots of $w$, which always exist in $\\mathbb{C}$. This statement is false.\n-   E. The map $p(z)=z^k$ is a polynomial, so it is infinitely differentiable everywhere. Its derivative is $p'(z) = kz^{k-1}$. At $z=0$, the derivative is $p'(0) = 0$, which is well-defined. This statement is false. While it is true that $p'(0)=0$ is the reason $p$ fails to be a local homeomorphism at $z=0$, which in turn causes the failure of the evenly covered condition, the most direct and fundamental failure of the *hypothesis of the Path Lifting Theorem* is the lack of an evenly covered neighborhood as described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1693395"}]}
