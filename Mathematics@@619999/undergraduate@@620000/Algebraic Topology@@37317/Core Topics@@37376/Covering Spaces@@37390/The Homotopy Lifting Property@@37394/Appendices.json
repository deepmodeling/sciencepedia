Let's demonstrate that this is both necessary and sufficient.\n\n**1. Necessity of the condition**\n\nAssume that a lift $\\tilde{f}: D^2 \\to \\tilde{X}$ exists such that $p \\circ \\tilde{f} = f$ and $\\tilde{f}|_{S^1} = \\tilde{g}$.\nThe existence of such a map $\\tilde{f}$ means that the map $\\tilde{g}: S^1 \\to \\tilde{X}$ can be extended to a map from the disk $D^2$ into $\\tilde{X}$. A fundamental theorem in topology states that a map from a sphere $S^{n-1}$ to a space $Y$ can be extended to a map from the ball $D^n$ if and only if the original map is nullhomotopic.\n\nIn our case, with $n=2$, the map $\\tilde{g}: S^1 \\to \\tilde{X}$ can be extended to $\\tilde{f}: D^2 \\to \\tilde{X}$ if and only if $\\tilde{g}$ is nullhomotopic in $\\tilde{X}$. Since we assumed $\\tilde{f}$ exists, it follows necessarily that $\\tilde{g}$ must be nullhomotopic. In terms of the fundamental group, this means that the loop $\\tilde{g}$ must represent the trivial element, i.e., $[\\tilde{g}] = e$ in $\\pi_1(\\tilde{X})$.\n\nThis shows that condition C is necessary. Option A is a weaker necessary condition (a nullhomotopic loop is always a closed loop), but it is not sufficient. Option B is the opposite of the necessary condition. Option D is a sufficient condition, but it is not necessary, as a loop can be nullhomotopic in a space without its image being contained in a contractible subset.\n\n**2. Sufficiency of the condition**\n\nNow, assume the condition holds: $\\tilde{g}: S^1 \\to \\tilde{X}$ is a nullhomotopic loop.\nThe fact that $\\tilde{g}$ is nullhomotopic means, by definition, that it can be extended to a map from the disk. Let's call this extension $\\tilde{h}: D^2 \\to \\tilde{X}$, so that $\\tilde{h}|_{S^1} = \\tilde{g}$.\n\nNow we have a lift, but it's not necessarily a lift of the original map $f$. Let's define a new map $f': D^2 \\to X$ by projecting $\\tilde{h}$ down to $X$: $f' = p \\circ \\tilde{h}$. Let's see how $f'$ relates to our original map $f$. We compare their values on the boundary $S^1$:\n$$ f'|_{S^1} = (p \\circ \\tilde{h})|_{S^1} = p \\circ (\\tilde{h}|_{S^1}) = p \\circ \\tilde{g} $$\nBy the problem's premise, $\\tilde{g}$ is a lift of $g = f|_{S^1}$, so $p \\circ \\tilde{g} = g = f|_{S^1}$. Therefore, we have $f'|_{S^1} = f|_{S^1}$.\n\nSo, we have two maps, $f: D^2 \\to X$ and $f': D^2 \\to X$, which agree on the boundary of the disk. We can define a homotopy $F: D^2 \\times [0,1] \\to X$ that deforms $f'$ into $f$ while keeping the boundary fixed. For example, such a homotopy exists because $(D^2, S^1)$ is a CW pair and thus has the homotopy extension property. Let this homotopy be defined such that $F(\\cdot, 0) = f'$ and $F(\\cdot, 1) = f$, and for any point $s \\in S^1$ on the boundary, $F(s, t) = g(s)$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nNow we use the **Homotopy Lifting Property** of covering spaces. We have a homotopy $F$ in the base space $X$. We also have a lift of the map at the start of the homotopy, $\\tilde{h}$, which lifts $f' = F(\\cdot, 0)$. The Homotopy Lifting Property guarantees the existence of a unique lifted homotopy $\\tilde{F}: D^2 \\times [0,1] \\to \\tilde{X}$ such that $p \\circ \\tilde{F} = F$ and $\\tilde{F}(\\cdot, 0) = \\tilde{h}$.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of this lifted homotopy on the boundary $S^1$. The original homotopy $F$ on the boundary is stationary, i.e., $F(s,t)=g(s)$. The lifted homotopy $\\tilde{F}(s,t)$ must lift this. At $t=0$, we have $\\tilde{F}(s,0) = \\tilde{h}(s) = \\tilde{g}(s)$. By the uniqueness of path lifting, the lift of the constant path $g(s)$ starting at $\\tilde{g}(s)$ is the constant path $\\tilde{g}(s)$. Therefore, $\\tilde{F}(s, t) = \\tilde{g}(s)$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$ and $s \\in S^1$.\n\nFinally, let us define our desired map $\\tilde{f}$ as the end of the lifted homotopy: $\\tilde{f} = \\tilde{F}(\\cdot, 1)$.\n1.  Is $\\tilde{f}$ a lift of $f$? Yes, because $p \\circ \\tilde{f} = p \\circ \\tilde{F}(\\cdot, 1) = F(\\cdot, 1) = f$.\n2.  Does $\\tilde{f}$ extend $\\tilde{g}$? Yes, because its restriction to the boundary is $\\tilde{f}|_{S^1}(s) = \\tilde{F}(s, 1) = \\tilde{g}(s)$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed the required lift $\\tilde{f}$. Thus, the condition that $\\tilde{g}$ is nullhomotopic is sufficient.\n\nSince the condition is both necessary and sufficient, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1685090"}]}
