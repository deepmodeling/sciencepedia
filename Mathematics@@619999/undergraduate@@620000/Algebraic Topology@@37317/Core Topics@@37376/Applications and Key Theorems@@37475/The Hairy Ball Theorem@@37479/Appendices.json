This exercise builds your intuition by connecting the mathematical *index* of a zero to its visual appearance, such as a source, a sink, or a saddle point.

According to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, any such vector field must have at least one point where the vector is zero. Let's assume our vector field $v$ has only a finite number of isolated zeros. For each isolated zero $p$, we can define an integer called the index of the vector field at $p$, denoted $\\text{ind}_p(v)$.

Specifically, there are two distinct directions along which the flow approaches the zero, and two other distinct directions (typically orthogonal to the first pair) along which the flow recedes from the zero.\n\n- **Behavior C (Center-like):** The integral curves near the zero exhibit one of three patterns: all curves originate from the zero and flow outwards (a source), all curves flow inwards and terminate at the zero (a sink), or the curves form closed loops circulating around the zero (a center).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly associates the index of an isolated zero with these behaviors?\n\nA.
