Let $p(z)$ be a non-constant polynomial. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $p(z) \\neq 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This means $p$ can be viewed as a continuous map $p: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n2. For any radius $R \\ge 0$, consider the circle $\\gamma_R(t) = R e^{2\\pi i t}$ in the domain, for $t \\in [0, 1]$. Its image, $p(\\gamma_R)$, is a closed loop in the codomain $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n3. The winding number of the loop $p(\\gamma_R)$ around the origin is a well-defined integer. Because $p$ is continuous, this winding number must be a continuous function of $R$. Since the winding number must be an integer, it must be constant for all $R \\ge 0$.\n4. For $R=0$, the circle is a point $z=0$, and its image is the point $p(0)$. The winding number of a point-loop is $0$.\n5. For very large $R$, the $z^n$ term of the polynomial $p(z) = a_n z^n + \\dots + a_0$ dominates. The loop $p(\\gamma_R)$ becomes homotopic to the loop of $a_n z^n$ traced on the circle of radius $R$, which is $t \\mapsto a_n (R e^{2\\pi i t})^n$. This loop winds around the origin $n$ times, where $n \\ge 1$ is the degree of the polynomial. Its winding number is $n$.\n6. This leads to a contradiction: the winding number is $0$ for $R=0$ but is $n \\ge 1$ for large $R$. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, and there must exist some $z_0$ such that $p(z_0)=0$.\n\nNow, consider applying an analogous argument to a non-constant real polynomial $p(x)$ as a map from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The argument fails. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental reason for this failure?\n\nA. The argument fails because for a real polynomial $p(x)$, the term $a_n x^n$ does not necessarily dominate the other terms for large values of $|x|$.\nB. The argument fails because the domain for the homotopy, a closed interval $[-R, R]$, is topologically different from a closed disk $|z| \\le R$, as the interval is contractible while the disk is not.\nC. The argument relies on the concept of a winding number, which is meaningful for loops in the punctured plane $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This concept is trivial or ill-defined for paths in the analogous codomain $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ because this space lacks the necessary topological structure to support non-trivial loops around the origin.\nD. The argument fails because the image of a real polynomial, unlike a complex one, is not guaranteed to be the entire codomain, so it is possible for the image to miss the origin.\nE.
