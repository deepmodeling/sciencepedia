The system's evolution is governed by a continuous 'guidance' function $f: D^n \\to D^n$, which proposes a new target state $f(x)$ that also lies within the unit ball.\n\nDue to an internal damping mechanism, the system does not immediately transition to the target state $f(x)$. Instead, its next state, defined by the map $g(x)$, is the midpoint between the current state $x$ and the proposed target state $f(x)$. The evolution of the system is thus described by the map $g(x) = \\frac{x + f(x)}{2}$.\n\nAn 'equilibrium point' of this system is a state $x_0$ that remains unchanged after one evolution step, meaning $g(x_0) = x_0$.
