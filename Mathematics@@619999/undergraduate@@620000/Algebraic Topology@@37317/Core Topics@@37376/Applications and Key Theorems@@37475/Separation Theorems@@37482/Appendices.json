While a simple closed curve divides the plane into exactly two regions, this problem asks you to consider a slightly more complex shape, a circle with a diameter, and determine how it partitions the plane [@problem_id:1672721].

We analyze the complement $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\Theta$.\n\nFirst, by the Jordan curve theorem, $S^{1}$ separates $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ into exactly two connected components:\n$$\nU=\\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}>1\\},\\qquad D=\\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}<1\\}.\n$$\nSince $S^{1}\\subset\\Theta$, both $U$ and $D$ are contained in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\Theta$ when $\\Theta$ is only $S^{1}$. Now we account for $I$. Note that $I\\cap D=\\{(0,y):-1<y<1\\}$, which is the open vertical segment\n$$\nJ=\\{(0,y): -1<y<1\\}.\n$$\nThe endpoints $(0,\\pm 1)$ lie on $S^{1}$, hence they are already excluded from the complement by removing $S^{1}$. Therefore\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\Theta=\\bigl(U\\bigr)\\,\\cup\\,\\bigl(D\\setminus J\\bigr),\n$$\nwith $U\\cap(D\\setminus J)=\\varnothing$.\n\nWe now show that $D\\setminus J$ has exactly two connected components. Define\n$$\nD_{+}=\\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}<1,\\ x>0\\},\\qquad D_{-}=\\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}<1,\\ x<0\\}.\n$$\nClearly $D_{+}$ and $D_{-}$ are disjoint, open in $D$, and $D\\setminus J=D_{+}\\cup D_{-}$. Each of $D_{+}$ and $D_{-}$ is path-connected (indeed convex arcs within each half-disk connect any two points).\n\nIt remains to show there is no path in $D\\setminus J$ from a point of $D_{+}$ to a point of $D_{-}$. Suppose $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to D\\setminus J$ is continuous with $\\gamma(0)\\in D_{+}$ and $\\gamma(1)\\in D_{-}$. Write $\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$. Then $x(0)>0$ and $x(1)<0$. By continuity and the intermediate value property, there exists $t_{0}\\in(0,1)$ with $x(t_{0})=0$. Because $\\gamma(t_{0})\\in D$, we have $y(t_{0})$ satisfying $-1<y(t_{0})<1$. Hence $\\gamma(t_{0})\\in J$, which contradicts $\\gamma([0,1])\\subset D\\setminus J$. Therefore $D\\setminus J$ splits into exactly two connected components, namely $D_{+}$ and $D_{-}$.\n\nFinally, we verify that $U$ is a distinct connected component of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\Theta$ and cannot be joined to either $D_{+}$ or $D_{-}$ by a path in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\Theta$. Any path from a point in $D$ to a point in $U$ must cross $S^{1}$ by the Jordan curve theorem, but $S^{1}\\subset\\Theta$ is removed; thus no such path exists in the complement.\n\nCombining these facts, the complement $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\Theta$ has exactly three connected components: the exterior $U$ and the two half-disks $D_{+}$ and $D_{-}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1672721"}, {"introduction": "Does removing a subset from a space always disconnect it? This problem challenges that simple assumption by exploring the removal of a line segment from an open disk [@problem_id:1672778]. You will discover that the resulting space remains path-connected, yet its topological character is fundamentally altered.

Given any two points $p,q\\in X=D\\setminus L$, consider the straight segment from $p$ to $q$. If it does not meet $L$, it is a path in $X$. If it meets $L$, one can modify the segment near each intersection by detouring around one endpoint of $L$ within $D$; since the endpoints of $L$ lie strictly inside $D$, there is room to pass around them without leaving $D$. Thus any two points in $X$ can be joined by a path in $X$, so $X$ is path-connected. Therefore options A and B are false.\n\nNext we determine the fundamental group.

We define a strong deformation retraction of $X=D\\setminus L$ onto $Y$ by pushing every point of $N\\setminus L$ along the shortest line segment orthogonal to $L$ out to the boundary $\\partial N$, and fixing points in $D\\setminus N$. More explicitly, there is a continuous “normal retraction” map $r:N\\setminus L\\to\\partial N$ that sends each point to the unique closest point on $\\partial N$ along the line orthogonal to $L$. Define a homotopy $H_{t}:X\\to X$ by\n- $H_{t}(p)=p$ for $p\\in D\\setminus N$,\n- along each normal line segment in $N\\setminus L$, $H_{t}$ moves $p$ linearly from $p$ to $r(p)$ as $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$, and fixes points of $\\partial N$.\nThis is continuous, remains in $X$ for all $t$, and satisfies $H_{0}=\\mathrm{id}_{X}$ and $H_{1}(X)=Y$.
