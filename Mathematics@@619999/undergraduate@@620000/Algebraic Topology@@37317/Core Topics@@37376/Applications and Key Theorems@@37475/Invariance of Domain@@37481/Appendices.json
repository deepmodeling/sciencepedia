A map $P: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is called a **polynomial map** if each of its component functions is a polynomial in the variables $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$. For instance, $P(x, y) = (x^2+y, y^3-2x)$ is a polynomial map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet's recall some standard definitions. A map $f: X \\to Y$ is:\n- **Injective** (or one-to-one) if for any distinct elements $a,b \\in X$, their images $f(a), f(b) \\in Y$ are also distinct.\n- A **homeomorphism** if it is a continuous bijection (injective and surjective) and its inverse map $f^{-1}: Y \\to X$ is also continuous.

Since $P$ is a polynomial map, it is continuous. The domain $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. By the invariance of domain theorem: if $U\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is open and $f:U\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is continuous and injective, then $f(U)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $f:U\\to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism. Applying this with $U=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ shows that $P(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ is open and $P$ is a homeomorphism onto its image. Therefore, A is true.\n\n- Statement B: If $P$ is a homeomorphism $\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $P^{-1}$ must also be a polynomial map. This is false in general. A counterexample in the case $n=1$ is $P(x)=x^{3}$, which is a polynomial homeomorphism of $\\mathbb{R}$ onto itself with inverse $P^{-1}(y)=y^{1/3}$, which is not a polynomial. Therefore, B is false.\n\n- Statement C: An injective polynomial map can only exist if each component has total degree exactly $1$. This is false. Again in $n=1$, $P(x)=x^{3}$ is injective and has degree $3$. In higher dimensions, $(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})\\mapsto(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n-1},x_{n}^{3})$ is an injective polynomial map with a non-linear component. Therefore, C is false.\n\n- Statement D: The image of any non-constant polynomial map $P:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is always open. This is false without the injectivity hypothesis. For example, for $n=2$, $P(x,y)=(x,y^{2})$ is a polynomial map with image $P(\\mathbb{R}^{2})=\\{(u,v)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}: v\\ge 0\\}=\\mathbb{R}\\times[0,\\infty)$, which is not open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

This exercise challenges you to think about a map that is not injective everywhere but is locally injective on a dense set of points.

Choose disjoint neighborhoods $W_{K}$ of $K$ and $W_{\\infty}$ of $\\infty$ in $S^{n}$. After collapsing $K \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ to $p$, a small punctured neighborhood of $p$ deformation retracts onto the disjoint union of the boundaries of these neighborhoods. The local homology at $p$ can be shown to be different from the local homology of a point in $S^n$. More precisely, collapsing a disconnected set like $K \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ to a point generally doesn't produce a manifold. In this case, the resulting space $S^{n}/(K \\cup \\{\\infty\\})$ is not a topological $n$-manifold and therefore cannot be homeomorphic to $S^{n}$.
