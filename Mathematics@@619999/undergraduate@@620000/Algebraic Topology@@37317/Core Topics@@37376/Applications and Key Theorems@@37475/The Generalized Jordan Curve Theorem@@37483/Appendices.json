We wish to explore a generalization of this idea to a more complex structure.\n\nConsider a graph $G_N$ embedded in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where $N$ is a positive integer. The graph is constructed from a single vertex and $N$ edges. Each edge starts and ends at this single vertex, forming a loop. The embedding has the property that these loops only intersect one another at the common vertex, and no individual loop intersects itself. Topologically, this graph is equivalent to a wedge sum of $N$ circles, denoted $\\bigvee_{i=1}^N S^1$.\n\nDetermine the number of connected components in the complement of this graph, $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus G_N$. Express your answer as a function of $N$.", "solution": "We model $G_{N}$ as a connected planar graph embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $V=1$ vertex and $E=N$ edges, where each edge is a loop based at the single vertex. In a planar embedding, the connected components of the complement $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus G_{N}$ are exactly the faces of the embedding (including the unbounded exterior face).\n\nFor any connected plane graph, Euler’s formula holds:\n$$\nV - E + F = 2,\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the number of faces. Substituting $V=1$ and $E=N$ gives\n$$\n1 - N + F = 2 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad F = N + 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the number of connected components of $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus G_{N}$ is $N+1$.\n\nEquivalently, one can argue inductively using the Jordan Curve Theorem: with no loops, the complement has $F(0)=1$ component. Adding one simple loop that meets the existing graph only at the vertex lies entirely inside a single face and, by the Jordan Curve Theorem, splits that face into exactly two, so $F$ increases by $1$. Thus $F(N)=F(0)+N=N+1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{N+1}$$", "id": "1683976"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a more complex separator in 2D, we now generalize in another direction: higher dimensions and multiple objects.
