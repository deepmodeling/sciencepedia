By definition, $B_1(T)$ is the image of the boundary map $\\partial_2: C_2(T) \\to C_1(T)$. The group of 2-chains, $C_2(T)$, is the free abelian group generated by the 2-simplices of the complex. A graph, such as a tree, is a 1-dimensional simplicial complex. It consists of vertices (0-simplices) and edges (1-simplices), but it contains no 2-simplices (filled triangles). Therefore, the set of 2-simplices is empty, and the group of 2-chains $C_2(T)$ is the trivial group, containing only the zero element, i.e., $C_2(T) = \\{0\\}$. The boundary map $\\partial_2$ must map the zero element of $C_2(T)$ to the zero element of $C_1(T)$. Consequently, the image of $\\partial_2$ is the trivial group consisting only of the zero 1-chain. Thus, for any graph, including a tree, we have $B_1(T) = \\{0\\}$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the group of 1-cycles, $Z_1(T)$. A 1-chain $z = \\sum_{i} a_i e_i$ (where $a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $e_i$ are oriented edges) is a 1-cycle if its boundary is zero, i.e., $\\partial_1(z) = 0$. Let $e_i = [v_{i,0}, v_{i,1}]$. Then $\\partial_1(z) = \\sum_i a_i (v_{i,1} - v_{i,0}) = 0$. This equation means that for every vertex $v$ in the tree, the sum of the coefficients of the edges incident to $v$ must be zero (where a coefficient is counted positively if the edge points away from $v$ and negatively if it points towards $v$).\nNow, suppose there exists a non-zero 1-cycle $z \\neq 0$. Let $S$ be the set of edges with non-zero coefficients in $z$. The subgraph formed by the edges in $S$ must have the property that every vertex has a degree of at least 2 (if we consider the absolute values of coefficients as multiplicities). A finite graph in which every vertex has a degree of at least 2 must contain a graph-theoretic cycle. However, a tree is defined as a graph containing no cycles. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that a non-zero 1-cycle exists must be false. The only 1-cycle on a tree is the zero 1-chain, $z=0$. This means the group of 1-cycles is trivial: $Z_1(T) = \\{0\\}$.\n\nCombining these two results, we have $Z_1(T) = \\{0\\}$ and $B_1(T) = \\{0\\}$. The statement $Z_1(T) = B_1(T)$ is therefore true because both groups are identical to the trivial group. This provides a complete and direct explanation based on the definitions. So, option B is the correct choice.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\nA. The existence of leaves is a property of trees, but it doesn't directly explain the relationship between cycles and boundaries. A graph can have leaves and also cycles in other parts of the graph. This statement is not the fundamental reason for $H_1(T)$ being trivial.\nC. The property of being planar (embeddable in $\\mathbb{R}^2$) is not relevant. For example, a simple cycle graph (like a triangle) is also planar, but its first homology group is $\\mathbb{Z}$, not $\\{0\\}$.\nD. The fact that for a tree, the number of vertices $V$ and edges $E$ are related by $V - E = 1$ is a correct combinatorial property. It is used in an alternative argument involving the Euler characteristic ($\\chi(T) = b_0 - b_1 = 1 - b_1 = 1 \\implies b_1=0$, where $b_k$ are the Betti numbers). However, this argument is less direct than analyzing the composition of $Z_1(T)$ and $B_1(T)$ from their fundamental definitions. Option B explains *what* these groups are, which is the most direct reason they are equal.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the most direct and complete reason.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1646085"}, {"introduction": "The richness of homology theory is partly revealed by how the choice of numerical coefficients can change the outcome.
