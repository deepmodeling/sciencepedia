A $k$-simplex is the convex hull of $k+1$ affinely independent points. For example, a 0-simplex is a vertex, a 1-simplex is a line segment, and a 2-simplex is a triangle. A simplicial complex $K$ is a collection of simplices satisfying two conditions: (1) any face of a simplex in $K$ is also in $K$, and (2) the intersection of any two simplices in $K$ is a face of both (or is empty).\n\nA common operation on a simplicial complex is the barycentric subdivision. Given a simplicial complex $K$, its first barycentric subdivision, denoted $Sd(K)$, is a new simplicial complex constructed as follows:\n1.  The vertices of $Sd(K)$ are the barycenters of the simplices of $K$.
