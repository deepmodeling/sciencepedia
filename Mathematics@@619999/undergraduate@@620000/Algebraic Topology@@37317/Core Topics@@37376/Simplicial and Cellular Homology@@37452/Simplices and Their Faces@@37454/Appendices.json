An $n$-simplex is defined as the convex hull of $n+1$ points that are in general position (specifically, they are affinely independent). The faces of a simplex are themselves simplices of lower dimension. For instance, a 0-simplex is a vertex (a single point), a 1-simplex is an edge connecting two vertices, a 2-simplex is a triangle, and a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron. An edge, or 1-simplex, is determined by selecting any pair of vertices from the set of vertices of the original $n$-simplex.\n\nA data scientist is analyzing a dataset and represents a key feature as a single, abstract $n$-simplex.

An edge (a 1-simplex) is formed by selecting any pair of these vertices. The total number of edges is therefore equal to the number of ways to choose 2 vertices from the set of $n+1$ vertices.\n\nThis is a problem of combinations. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $m$ items is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m}{k}$. In our case, we are choosing $k=2$ vertices from a set of $m=n+1$ vertices.\n\nThe number of edges, $N_e$, of an $n$-simplex is given by:\n$$N_e = \\binom{n+1}{2}$$\n\nWe are given that the simplex has $N_e = 28$ edges. We can set up the equation:\n$$\\binom{n+1}{2} = 28$$\n\nNow, we expand the binomial coefficient:\n$$\\binom{n+1}{2} = \\frac{(n+1)!}{2!(n+1-2)!} = \\frac{(n+1)!}{2!(n-1)!}$$\n\nWe can simplify the factorial expression:\n$$\\frac{(n+1)!}{(n-1)!} = \\frac{(n+1) \\cdot n \\cdot (n-1)!}{(n-1)!} = (n+1)n$$\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\n$$\\frac{(n+1)n}{2} = 28$$\n\nTo solve for $n$, we first multiply both sides by 2:\n$$(n+1)n = 56$$\n\nThis gives us a quadratic equation:\n$$n^2 + n = 56$$\n$$n^2 + n - 56 = 0$$\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need two numbers that multiply to -56 and add to +1. These numbers are +8 and -7.\n$$(n+8)(n-7) = 0$$\n\nThis equation yields two possible solutions for $n$:\n$$n+8=0 \\implies n = -8$$\n$$n-7=0 \\implies n = 7$$\n\nThe dimension of a simplex, $n$, must be a non-negative integer ($n \\ge 0$).
