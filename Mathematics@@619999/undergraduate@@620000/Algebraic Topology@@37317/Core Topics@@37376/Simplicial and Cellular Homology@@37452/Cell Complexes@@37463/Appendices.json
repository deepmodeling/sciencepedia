This first exercise walks you through the most fundamental example: creating a space by attaching a 1-dimensional cell (an interval) to a 0-dimensional cell (a point). By understanding how the endpoints of the interval are identified via an \"attaching map,\" you will see how a familiar shape emerges, providing a concrete foundation for more complex constructions. [@problem_id:1636299]", "problem": "In algebraic topology, complex spaces are often built by progressively attaching cells of increasing dimension. This process is fundamental to Cellular Homology and understanding the structure of topological spaces. Consider the following construction of a topological space, denoted as $X$.\n\nWe begin with a base space $X_0$ which consists of a single point, i.e., $X_0 = \\{p\\}$. We then take a 1-dimensional cell, which is represented by the closed unit interval $D^1 = [0, 1]$. The boundary of this cell is the set of its two endpoints, $\\partial D^1 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nA new space $X$ is formed by \"attaching\" the 1-cell $D^1$ to the 0-cell space $X_0$ using a continuous attaching map $\\phi: \\partial D^1 \\to X_0$. For this particular construction, the attaching map is defined to send both boundary points of the interval to the single point in $X_0$. That is, $\\phi(0) = p$ and $\\phi(1) = p$.\n\nThe resulting space $X$ is the quotient space obtained from the disjoint union of $X_0$ and $D^1$, by identifying each point $x$ in the boundary $\\partial D^1$ with its image $\\phi(x)$ in $X_0$. Formally, $X = (X_0 \\sqcup D^1) / \\sim$, where $\\sim$ is the smallest equivalence relation such that $x \\sim \\phi(x)$ for all $x \\in \\partial D^1$.\n\nThe space $X$ is homeomorphic to which of the following well-known topological spaces?\n\nA.
