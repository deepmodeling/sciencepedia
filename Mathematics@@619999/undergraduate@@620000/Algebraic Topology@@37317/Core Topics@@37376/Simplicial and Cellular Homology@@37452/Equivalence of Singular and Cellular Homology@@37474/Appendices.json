It can be constructed as a CW-complex in a minimal fashion, using precisely one cell in each of dimensions 0, 1, and 2. Let these cells be denoted $e^0$, $e^1$, and $e^2$.\n\nThe construction of this CW complex, from its 0-skeleton up, is as follows:\n1.  The 0-skeleton, $X^0$, is simply the 0-cell $e^0$ (a single point).\n2.  The 1-skeleton, $X^1$, is formed by attaching the 1-cell $e^1$ (topologically an open interval) to $X^0$. The two endpoints of the closure of $e^1$ are both identified with the single point $e^0$, thus forming a space homeomorphic to a circle, $S^1$.\n3.  The 2-skeleton, which is $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ itself, is formed by attaching the 2-cell $e^2$ (topologically an open disk) to the 1-skeleton $X^1$. The attachment is specified by a map from the boundary of the 2-cell, $\\partial e^2 \\cong S^1$, to the 1-skeleton $X^1 \\cong S^1$.
