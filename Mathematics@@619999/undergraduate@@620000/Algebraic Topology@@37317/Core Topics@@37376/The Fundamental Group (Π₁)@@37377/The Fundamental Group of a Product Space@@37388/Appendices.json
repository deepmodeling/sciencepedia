A key theorem in group theory states that a direct product $G \\times H$ is a free group if and only if one of the groups is trivial and the other is a free group.\nTo see why this is true, suppose both $G$ and $H$ are non-trivial groups. Let $g \\in G$ be an element other than the identity $e_G$, and let $h \\in H$ be an element other than the identity $e_H$. In the direct product $G \\times H$, consider the elements $(g, e_H)$ and $(e_G, h)$. Both of these elements are non-trivial.

If $G \\times H$ were a non-trivial free group, it could either be $\\mathbb{Z}$ or a non-abelian free group.\nCase 1: $G \\times H \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is indecomposable (cannot be written as a direct product of two non-trivial subgroups), this implies that one of $G$ or $H$ must be the trivial group.\nCase 2: $G \\times H$ is a non-abelian free group. Such groups cannot contain a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. The commuting non-trivial elements $(g, e_H)$ and $(e_G, h)$ would generate a subgroup that is not free (it would have the relation $ab=ba$), unless one element is a power of the other, which is not the case here. Therefore, if $G$ and $H$ are both non-trivial, $G \\times H$ cannot be a non-abelian free group.\nThus, for $G \\times H$ to be free, one of $G$ or $H$ must be trivial.
