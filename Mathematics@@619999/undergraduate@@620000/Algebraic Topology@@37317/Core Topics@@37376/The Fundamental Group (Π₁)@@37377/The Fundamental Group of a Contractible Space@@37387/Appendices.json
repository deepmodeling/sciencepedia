We will solve this by showing that $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to a simpler, well-known space. A more formal way, which we will follow, is to analyze the construction of $Y$ in two stages and apply a standard theorem from algebraic topology.\n\nFirst, let's define an intermediate space $X'$ by attaching the interval $I$ to $X$ at only one of the endpoints. Let $X' = (X \\sqcup I) / (0 \\sim x_0)$. Topologically, this space consists of the original space $X$ with a copy of the interval $I$ attached at the point $x_0$, with the other end of the interval (at point $1$) being free.\n\nThe space $X'$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$. To see this, we can define a deformation retraction from $X'$ onto the subspace corresponding to $X$. The attached interval, which we can denote as $I'$, has one endpoint attached to $X$ at $x_0$ and the other endpoint free. This interval can be continuously \"shrunk\" back to the attachment point $x_0$. This process defines a deformation retraction from $X'$ to $X$. Since $X$ is contractible, its fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ is the trivial group, $\\{e\\}$. Because the fundamental group is a homotopy invariant, the fundamental group of $X'$, $\\pi_1(X')$, must also be the trivial group.\n\nNext, we observe how the final space $Y$ is constructed from the intermediate space $X'$. The space $Y$ is formed by taking $X'$ and identifying the free endpoint of the attached interval (the point corresponding to $1 \\in I$) with the point $x_1$ in the subspace $X \\subset X'$. In the language of quotient spaces, $Y$ is homeomorphic to the space $X'$ with the points corresponding to $1 \\in I$ and $x_1 \\in X$ identified. Let $p: X' \\to Y$ be the quotient map. The points being identified are distinct in $X'$ since $x_1 \\in X$ and the free end of the interval is not in $X$.\n\nWe now use a standard result concerning the fundamental group of a space obtained by identifying two points. The theorem states: If a space $Z$ is obtained from a path-connected space $W$ by identifying two distinct points $w_0, w_1 \\in W$, then the fundamental group of the resulting space $Z$ is the free product of the fundamental group of $W$ and the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. That is, $\\pi_1(Z) \\cong \\pi_1(W) * \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe can apply this theorem to our situation.\n- The initial space is $W = X'$.\n- The resulting space is $Z = Y$.\n- The points being identified are $w_0$ (the free end of the interval in $X'$) and $w_1$ (the point $x_1$ in $X'$).\n\nSince $X$ is contractible, it is path-connected. Attaching an interval to a path-connected space results in a path-connected space, so $X'$ is path-connected. The conditions of the theorem are met.\n\nWe found earlier that $\\pi_1(X') = \\{e\\}$.
