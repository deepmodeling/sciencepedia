This first practice is a foundational exercise that explores the direct consequences of this structure. By considering a hypothetical case where all relative homology groups $H_n(X, A)$ are trivial, you will uncover what this implies about the relationship between the absolute homology groups $H_n(A)$ and $H_n(X)$, providing a crucial insight into how the sequence functions as a diagnostic tool [@problem_id:1687281].", "problem": "Let $(X, A)$ be a pair of topological spaces, where $A$ is a subspace of $X$.

The problem states that for our specific pair $(X, A)$, all relative homology groups are trivial. That is, $H_k(X, A) = \\{0\\}$ for all integers $k \\ge 0$, where $\\{0\\}$ denotes the trivial group.\n\nWe can analyze the consequences of this condition by examining segments of the long exact sequence. We will show that the map $i_{n*}: H_n(A) \\to H_n(X)$ (we will write $i_*$ for simplicity) must be both injective and surjective for all $n \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, let's prove that $i_*$ is surjective. Consider the following segment of the long exact sequence:\n$$ H_n(A) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(X) \\xrightarrow{j_*} H_n(X, A) $$\nFrom the given condition, $H_n(X, A) = \\{0\\}$. So, the sequence becomes:\n$$ H_n(A) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(X) \\xrightarrow{j_*} \\{0\\} $$\nThe map $j_*: H_n(X) \\to \\{0\\}$ sends every element of $H_n(X)$ to the zero element. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity (zero) element in the codomain. Therefore, the kernel of $j_*$ is the entire domain, $\\ker(j_*) = H_n(X)$.\nBy the property of exactness, the image of the preceding map must be equal to the kernel of the next map. Thus, we have $\\text{Im}(i_*) = \\ker(j_*)$.\nSubstituting our finding for $\\ker(j_*)$, we get $\\text{Im}(i_*) = H_n(X)$. A homomorphism is surjective if its image is equal to its codomain. The codomain of $i_*: H_n(A) \\to H_n(X)$ is $H_n(X)$. Since we have shown that $\\text{Im}(i_*) = H_n(X)$, the map $i_*$ is surjective.\n\nNext, let's prove that $i_*$ is injective. Consider the following segment of the long exact sequence involving the map $i_*: H_n(A) \\to H_n(X)$:\n$$ H_{n+1}(X, A) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_{n+1}} H_n(A) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(X) $$\nAgain, by the given condition, $H_{n+1}(X, A) = \\{0\\}$. The sequence segment thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\{0\\} \\xrightarrow{\\partial_{n+1}} H_n(A) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(X) $$\nThe map $\\partial_{n+1}$ is a homomorphism from the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ to $H_n(A)$. The only element in the domain is the identity, which must map to the identity in $H_n(A)$. Therefore, the image of this map is the trivial subgroup of $H_n(A)$, i.e., $\\text{Im}(\\partial_{n+1}) = \\{0\\}$.\nBy exactness, the kernel of $i_*$ must be equal to the image of the preceding map $\\partial_{n+1}$. So, $\\ker(i_*) = \\text{Im}(\\partial_{n+1})$.\nThis gives us $\\ker(i_*) = \\{0\\}$. A homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is the trivial group. Therefore, the map $i_*$ is injective.\n\nSince the homomorphism $i_*: H_n(A) \\to H_n(X)$ is both injective and surjective for all $n \\ge 0$, it is by definition an isomorphism. This means that for each $n$, the groups $H_n(A)$ and $H_n(X)$ are isomorphic, $H_n(A) \\cong H_n(X)$.\n\nTherefore, the property that $i_*$ must have is that of being an isomorphism. This corresponds to option D. Option E is incorrect because while an identity map is an isomorphism, an isomorphism is not necessarily the identity map, especially since $H_n(A)$ and $H_n(X)$ are not necessarily the same set. The other options are incorrect because $i_*$ is both injective and surjective.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1687281"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract algebra to geometric intuition, we now focus on the most unique feature of the long exact sequence: the connecting homomorphism, $\\partial$.
