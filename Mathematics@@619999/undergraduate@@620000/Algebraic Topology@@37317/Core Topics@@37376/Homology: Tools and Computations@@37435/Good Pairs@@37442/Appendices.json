Every finite embedded graph in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ admits a regular neighborhood that deformation retracts onto it. Concretely, a thin collar (union of narrow rectangles around each edge) provides an open neighborhood $U$ together with a deformation retraction onto $G$ (e.g., by nearest-point projection piecewise along the collars and straight-line homotopy).

To apply the neighborhood deformation retract criterion, we verify local contractibility: at any point with $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and $y\\notin\\mathbb{Z}$, a small ball intersects $G$ in a short segment of a vertical line; at a lattice point $(m,n)$ a small ball intersects $G$ in a cross (union of two short perpendicular segments).

These lie in distinct path-components, and none of them connects to the component containing $p$ (connections occur only along $y=0$). Thus every neighborhood of $p$ in $G$ has infinitely many path-components and is not connected, hence cannot be contractible. Therefore $G$ is not locally contractible at such points. If $(\\mathbb{R}^{2},G)$ were a good pair, then $G$ would be a neighborhood deformation retract of some open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and, as a consequence, an ANR; in particular, $G$ would be locally contractible.
