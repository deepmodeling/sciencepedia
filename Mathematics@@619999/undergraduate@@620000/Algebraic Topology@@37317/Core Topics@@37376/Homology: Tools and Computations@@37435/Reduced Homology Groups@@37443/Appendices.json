It states that for a disjoint union of spaces, the homology group of the union is the direct sum of the homology groups of the individual spaces. For two spaces $X$ and $Y$, this gives us the isomorphism:\n$$ H_n(X \\sqcup Y) \\cong H_n(X) \\oplus H_n(Y) \\quad \\text{for all } n \\ge 0. $$\nThis isomorphism is induced by the inclusion maps of $X$ and $Y$ into $X \\sqcup Y$.\n\nNext, we recall the relationship between the ordinary homology groups $H_n(Z)$ and the reduced homology groups $\\tilde{H}_n(Z)$ for any topological space $Z$. The reduced homology groups are defined from the augmented singular chain complex, which differs from the standard singular chain complex only in dimension 0. The relationship is as follows:\n1. For dimensions $n > 0$, the groups are identical: $H_n(Z) \\cong \\tilde{H}_n(Z)$.\n2. For dimension $n=0$, if the space $Z$ is non-empty, the relationship is given by the split short exact sequence $0 \\to \\tilde{H}_0(Z) \\to H_0(Z) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$, which implies: $H_0(Z) \\cong \\tilde{H}_0(Z) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe now apply these facts to our specific problem, considering the cases $n > 0$ and $n=0$ separately.\n\nCase 1: $n > 0$\nFor any dimension $n > 0$, we can directly use the isomorphism between ordinary and reduced homology.\nStarting from the additivity axiom:\n$$ H_n(X \\sqcup Y) \\cong H_n(X) \\oplus H_n(Y) $$\nSince $n > 0$, we have $H_n(Z) \\cong \\tilde{H}_n(Z)$ for $Z$ being $X$, $Y$, or $X \\sqcup Y$. Substituting these into the equation gives:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_n(X \\sqcup Y) \\cong \\tilde{H}_n(X) \\oplus \\tilde{H}_n(Y) \\quad \\text{for } n > 0. $$\n\nCase 2: $n = 0$\nFor dimension $n=0$, we start again with the additivity axiom:\n$$ H_0(X \\sqcup Y) \\cong H_0(X) \\oplus H_0(Y) $$\nThe problem states that $X$ and $Y$ are non-empty. This implies that their disjoint union $X \\sqcup Y$ is also non-empty. Therefore, for each of these spaces, we can use the relation $H_0(Z) \\cong \\tilde{H}_0(Z) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSubstituting this relation for $Z = X \\sqcup Y$, $Z = X$, and $Z = Y$ into the additivity isomorphism, we get:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_0(X \\sqcup Y) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cong (\\tilde{H}_0(X) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\tilde{H}_0(Y) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) $$\nWe can rearrange the right-hand side:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_0(X \\sqcup Y) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\tilde{H}_0(X) \\oplus \\tilde{H}_0(Y) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} $$\nSince we are dealing with abelian groups, we can cancel one copy of the group $\\mathbb{Z}$ from both sides of the isomorphism.
