The discriminant is $D = b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4(7)(4) = 100 - 112 = -12$.

The translation matrix $T^k = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  k \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$ for an integer $k$. The action $f \\circ T^k$ transforms a form $[a, b, c]$ to $[a, b+2ak, ak^2+bk+c]$.\n2. The inversion matrix $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The action $f \\circ S$ transforms a form $[a, b, c]$ to $[c, -b, a]$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\nStep A: If $|b| > a$, apply a transformation $T^k$ to replace $b$ with $b' = b+2ak$ such that $|b'| \\leq a$. This is achieved by choosing $k = -\\lfloor \\frac{b+a}{2a} \\rfloor$.\nStep B: If $a > c$, apply the transformation $S$.\nThese steps are repeated until the form satisfies the reduction conditions. We begin with the form $f_0 = [7, 10, 4]$ and track the total transformation matrix $M$, which starts as the identity matrix $M_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Iteration 1:**\nThe current form is $[a_0, b_0, c_0] = [7, 10, 4]$.\nWe check the reduction conditions.

We will perform this analysis in four steps as requested: enumerating the reduced forms, determining the group law table via Dirichlet composition, finding the order of each element, and finally summing these orders.\n\nFirst, we enumerate all reduced, primitive, positive definite binary quadratic forms $f(x,y)=ax^2+bxy+cy^2$ of discriminant $D=b^2-4ac=-20$.\nA form is positive definite if $D0$ and $a0$. Since $D=-20$ is negative, we only require $a$ to be a positive integer.\nThe form is primitive if $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$.\nThe reduction conditions are:\n1. $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$\n2. If $|b|=a$ or $a=c$, then $b \\geq 0$.\n\nFrom the discriminant equation, we have $4ac = b^2 - D = b^2 + 20$.\nFrom the reduction condition $|b| \\leq a$, we have $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nAlso, $a \\leq c$ implies $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$.\nSubstituting the expression for $4ac$, we get $4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 20$.\nCombining this with $b^2 \\leq a^2$, we obtain an inequality for $a$:\n$4a^2 \\leq a^2 + 20 \\implies 3a^2 \\leq 20 \\implies a^2 \\leq \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67$.\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $a$ are $1$ and $2$.\n\nCase 1: $a=1$.\nThe reduction condition $|b| \\leq a$ implies $|b| \\leq 1$, so $b \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThe discriminant equation is $4(1)c = b^2 + 20$, so $4c = b^2 + 20$.\n- If $b=0$: $4c = 0^2 + 20 = 20 \\implies c=5$. This gives the form $(1, 0, 5)$.\n  - We check the reduction conditions: $|0| \\leq 1 \\leq 5$. This holds. The additional conditions on $b$ are not applicable as $|b| \\neq a$ and $a \\neq c$.\n  - We check for primitivity: $\\gcd(1, 0, 5) = 1$. The form is primitive.\n  - Thus, $f_1(x,y) = x^2+5y^2$ is a reduced form.\n- If $b=1$ or $b=-1$: $4c = (\\pm 1)^2 + 20 = 21$. This does not yield an integer solution for $c$.\n\nCase 2: $a=2$.\nThe reduction condition $|b| \\leq a$ implies $|b| \\leq 2$, so $b \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe discriminant equation is $4(2)c = b^2 + 20$, so $8c = b^2 + 20$. For $c$ to be an integer, $b^2+20$ must be divisible by $8$.\n- If $b=0$: $8c = 20$, no integer $c$.\n- If $b=\\pm 1$: $8c = 1+20=21$, no integer $c$.\n- If $b=\\pm 2$: $b^2=4$, so $8c = 4+20=24 \\implies c=3$. This gives two potential forms: $(2, 2, 3)$ and $(2, -2, 3)$.\n  - For $(2, 2, 3)$:\n    - Check reduction: $|2| \\leq 2 \\leq 3$. This holds. We have the case $|b|=a=2$. The condition requires $b \\geq 0$. Here $b=2$, so the condition is satisfied.\n    - Check primitivity: $\\gcd(2, 2, 3) = 1$. The form is primitive.\n    - Thus, $f_2(x,y)=2x^2+2xy+3y^2$ is a reduced form.\n  - For $(2, -2, 3)$:\n    - Check reduction: $|-2| \\leq 2 \\leq 3$. This holds. We have the case $|b|=a=2$. The condition requires $b \\geq 0$. Here $b=-2$, so the condition is not satisfied. This form is not reduced.\n\nIn total, there are two reduced, primitive, positive definite forms of discriminant $D=-20$:\n1. $f_1 = (1, 0, 5)$, which corresponds to the form $x^2+5y^2$.\n2. $f_2 = (2, 2, 3)$, which corresponds to the form $2x^2+2xy+3y^2$.\n\nThe number of such forms is the class number, $h(-20)=2$. The class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(-20)$ consists of two elements, the equivalence classes of these two forms. Let $I = [f_1] = [1, 0, 5]$ and $A = [f_2] = [2, 2, 3]$. The principal form for $D=-20 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ is $x^2 - (D/4)y^2 = x^2 - (-20/4)y^2 = x^2+5y^2$. So, $I = [1,0,5]$ is the identity element of the group.\n\nNext, we establish the group law table for $\\mathrm{Cl}(-20) = \\{I, A\\}$. A group of order $2$ must be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The group table is necessarily:\n$I \\circ I = I$\n$I \\circ A = A \\circ I = A$\n$A \\circ A = I$\n\nWe explicitly verify the composition $A \\circ A = I$ using Dirichlet composition on the representative forms. We need to compose $f_2=(2, 2, 3)$ with itself. Direct composition is difficult since the leading coefficients are not coprime. We first find a properly equivalent form to $f_2$ whose leading coefficient is coprime to $2$.\nLet's apply the transformation $\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha  \\beta \\\\ \\gamma  \\delta \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\alpha\\delta-\\beta\\gamma=1$ to $f_2(x,y)$. The new form has leading coefficient $a' = 2\\alpha^2+2\\alpha\\gamma+3\\gamma^2$. We need $a'$ to be odd, which requires $3\\gamma^2$ to be odd, so $\\gamma$ must be odd. Let's choose a simple transformation with $\\gamma=1$. For instance, take the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This maps $(x,y)$ to $(-y, x)$. The new form is $f_2(-y, x) = 2(-y)^2 + 2(-y)(x) + 3(x)^2 = 3x^2-2xy+2y^2$. So, $f_2$ is properly equivalent to $f_2' = (3, -2, 2)$. The discriminant is $(-2)^2-4(3)(2) = 4-24=-20$, as expected.\n\nNow we compose $f_2=(2, 2, 3)$ and $f_2'=(3, -2, 2)$. Let $(a_1,b_1,c_1)=(2,2,3)$ and $(a_2,b_2,c_2)=(3,-2,2)$. Since $\\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \\gcd(2, 3) = 1$, we can find a unique integer $B$ modulo $2a_1a_2=12$ such that:\n$B \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{2a_1} \\implies B \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$\n$B \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{2a_2} \\implies B \\equiv -2 \\pmod 6$\nFrom the first congruence, $B$ can be $2, 6, 10, \\dots$ or $-2, -6, \\dots$.\nFrom the second congruence, $B$ can be $4, 10, \\dots$ or $-2, -8, \\dots$.\nA common solution is $B=-2$. The composed form is $(a_1 a_2, B, C) = (6, -2, C)$.\nThe coefficient $C$ is determined by the discriminant: $B^2 - 4(a_1 a_2)C = D \\implies (-2)^2 - 4(6)C = -20 \\implies 4 - 24C = -20 \\implies 24C = 24 \\implies C=1$.\nThe composite form is $(6, -2, 1)$.\n\nThis form is not reduced because $a=6 > c=1$. We apply the reduction algorithm.\n1. Apply the transformation $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $(6, -2, 1)$. This results in $(1, -(-2), 6) = (1, 2, 6)$.\n2. This form is not reduced because for $a=1, b=2$, we have $|b| > a$. We apply a transformation $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  k \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $(1, 2, 6)$, choosing an integer $k$ to minimize $|b+2ak| = |2+2(1)k|$. Choosing $k=-1$ gives $|2-2|=0$. The new coefficients are:\n   $a' = a = 1$\n   $b' = b+2ak = 2+2(1)(-1) = 0$\n   $c' = ak^2+bk+c = 1(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 6 = 1-2+6 = 5$.\nThe resulting form is $(1, 0, 5)$. This form is reduced, as shown earlier.\nThus, the composition of $[f_2]$ with itself yields $[f_1]$, confirming that $A \\circ A = I$. The group table is:\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cc}\n$\\circ$  $I$  $A$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$I$  $I$  $A$ \\\\\n$A$  $A$  $I$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\nNext, we determine the group-theoretic order of each class.\nThe order of an element is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that its $n$-th power is the identity element.\n- The class $I=[1, 0, 5]$ is the identity element, so its order is $1$.\n- For the class $A=[2, 2, 3]$, we have $A^1 = A \\neq I$ and $A^2 = A \\circ A = I$. So, the order of $A$ is $2$.\n\nFinally, we compute $S$, the sum of the orders of all elements of $\\mathrm{Cl}(-20)$.\nThe elements are $I$ and $A$. The orders are $\\mathrm{ord}(I)=1$ and $\\mathrm{ord}(A)=2$.\nThe sum of the orders is $S = \\mathrm{ord}(I) + \\mathrm{ord}(A) = 1 + 2 = 3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3009179"}, {"introduction": "We conclude our hands-on tour by shifting focus from the \"global\" structure of the class group to the \"local\" symmetries of a single form.

These correspond to the four units in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$:\n- $1+0i = 1$\n- $-1+0i = -1$\n- $0+1i = i$\n- $0-1i = -i$\nThe group of units is $\\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$, which is a cyclic group of order $4$ generated by $i$.\n\nTo establish the isomorphism, we identify the vector space $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ via the canonical map $(x,y) \\mapsto z = x+iy$. The action of an automorphism matrix $A$ on a vector $(x,y)$ must correspond to a multiplicative action on the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The value of the quadratic form $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ is precisely the norm $N(x+iy)$. An automorphism preserves this norm.\nLet $u=p+iq$ be a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Multiplication by $u$ acts on $z=x+iy$:\n$$ u \\cdot z = (p+iq)(x+iy) = (px-qy) + i(qx+py) $$\nThis corresponds to a linear transformation on the coordinates $(x,y)$:\n$$ (x,y) \\mapsto (px-qy, qx+py) $$\nThe matrix representing this transformation is $M_u = \\begin{pmatrix} p  -q \\\\ q  p \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nLet's find the matrices corresponding to the four units of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$:\n- For $u=1$ ($p=1, q=0$): $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- For $u=-1$ ($p=-1, q=0$): $M_{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- For $u=i$ ($p=0, q=1$): $M_i = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- For $u=-i$ ($p=0, q=-1$): $M_{-i} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are precisely the four matrices of the group of proper automorphisms. The map $u \\mapsto M_u$ is a group homomorphism from the group of units of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ to the group of proper automorphisms of $f$. Since it is a bijection between two groups of order $4$, it is a group isomorphism.\nThe determinant of $M_u$ is $p^2 - (-q^2) = p^2+q^2 = N(u)$. Since $u$ is a unit, $N(u)=1$, which confirms that the corresponding matrix is a proper automorphism.\n\n**Part 3: Cardinality of the Subgroup of Proper Automorphisms**\n\nAs determined in Part 2, the subgroup of proper automorphisms consists of the four matrices:\n$$ \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\} $$\nThe cardinality of a group is the number of its elements. Therefore, the cardinality of the subgroup of proper automorphisms of $[1,0,1]$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3009173"}]}
