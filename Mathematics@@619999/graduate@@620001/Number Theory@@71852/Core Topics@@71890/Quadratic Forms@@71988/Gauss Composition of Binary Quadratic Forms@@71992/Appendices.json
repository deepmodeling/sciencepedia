First, we must determine the complete list of reduced primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms of discriminant $D = -4$ and thereby find the class number $h(-4)$. Second, we must compute the Gauss composition of the principal reduced form with itself.\n\nPart 1: Determination of Reduced Forms and Class Number $h(-4)$\n\nA binary quadratic form $Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ is specified by the integer coefficients $(a, b, c)$. The discriminant is $D = b^2 - 4ac$. We are given $D = -4$. The form must be primitive, i.e., $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, and positive definite, i.e., $D < 0$ and $a > 0$.\n\nA form is reduced if it satisfies the inequalities $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$, with the additional condition that if $|b| = a$ or $a = c$, then $b \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's find all integer triples $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy these conditions for $D=-4$.\nThe discriminant equation is $b^2 - 4ac = -4$, which can be rewritten as $4ac = b^2 + 4$.\nSince $a$ and $c$ are integers, $b^2+4$ must be divisible by $4$. This implies that $b^2$ must be divisible by $4$, which in turn implies that $b$ must be an even integer. Let $b = 2k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe use the reduction inequalities to constrain the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nFrom the positive definite condition, we have $a > 0$.\nThe reduction conditions are $|b| \\leq a$ and $a \\leq c$.\nSince $a \\leq c$, we have $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$. Substituting $4ac = b^2 + 4$, we get $4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 4$.\nFrom $|b| \\leq a$, we have $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nCombining these inequalities, we have:\n$4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 4 \\leq a^2 + 4$\nThis leads to $3a^2 \\leq 4$.\n\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, $a^2$ must be a positive integer. The inequality $a^2 \\leq \\frac{4}{3}$ has only one positive integer solution for $a^2$, which is $a^2 = 1$. This implies $a = 1$.\n\nNow that we have determined $a=1$, we use the condition $|b| \\leq a$ to find $b$.\n$|b| \\leq 1$.\nAs established earlier, $b$ must be an even integer. The only even integer $b$ satisfying $|b| \\leq 1$ is $b = 0$.\n\nFinally, we find the value of $c$ using the discriminant equation:\n$b^2 - 4ac = -4$\n$0^2 - 4(1)c = -4$\n$-4c = -4$\n$c = 1$.\n\nThis gives us a unique candidate for a reduced form: the triple of coefficients $(a,b,c) = (1, 0, 1)$. We must verify that this form satisfies all the required conditions.\n1. Form: $Q(x,y) = 1x^2 + 0xy + 1y^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n2. Discriminant: $D = 0^2 - 4(1)(1) = -4$. This is correct.\n3. Positive definite: $D < 0$ and $a = 1 > 0$. This is correct.\n4. Primitive: $\\gcd(a, b, c) = \\gcd(1, 0, 1) = 1$. This is correct.\n5. Reduced:\n   - $|b| \\leq a \\implies |0| \\leq 1$, which is true.\n   - $a \\leq c \\implies 1 \\leq 1$, which is true.\n   - Tie-breaking condition: Since $a=c=1$, we must have $b \\geq 0$. Our value $b=0$ satisfies this.\nThe form $(1, 0, 1)$ is indeed a reduced primitive positive definite form of discriminant $D=-4$. Since it is the only such form we found, the complete list of such forms consists of just this one form.\n\nThe class number, denoted $h(D)$, is the number of distinct proper equivalence classes of primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $D$. This is equal to the number of reduced forms.\nSince there is only one reduced form, the class number is $h(-4) = 1$.\n\nPart 2: Gauss Composition\n\nWe are asked to compose the principal reduced form of discriminant $D=-4$ with itself. The principal form is the form representing the identity element of the class group. For positive definite forms, this is the form with $a=1$. In our case, the only reduced form is $(1, 0, 1)$, so this is necessarily the principal form.\n\nLet $Q_1(x_1, y_1) = x_1^2 + y_1^2$ and $Q_2(x_2, y_2) = x_2^2 + y_2^2$. The coefficients are $(a_1, b_1, c_1) = (1, 0, 1)$ and $(a_2, b_2, c_2) = (1, 0, 1)$. We want to find the coefficients $(a'', b'', c'')$ of the composed form $Q'' = Q_1 \\circ Q_2$.\n\nThe theory of Gauss composition provides a method to construct the composed form. First, we compute $g = \\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\frac{b_1+b_2}{2})$.\nWith our values, $g = \\gcd(1, 1, \\frac{0+0}{2}) = \\gcd(1, 1, 0) = 1$.\n\nThe first coefficient of the composed form, $a''$, is given by $a'' = \\frac{a_1 a_2}{g^2}$.\n$a'' = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{1^2} = 1$.\n\nThe second coefficient, $b''$, is an integer $B$ that is a simultaneous solution to the following system of congruences:\n1. $B \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{2a_1/g}$\n2. $B \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{2a_2/g}$\n3. $B^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a_1 a_2 / g^2}$\n\nSubstituting the given values ($a_1=1, b_1=0, a_2=1, b_2=0, D=-4, g=1$):\n1. $B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2(1)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n2. $B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2(1)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n3. $B^2 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{4(1)(1)/1^2} \\implies B^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n\nFrom the first congruence, $B$ must be an even integer. Let $B = 2k$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSubstituting this into the third congruence: $(2k)^2 = 4k^2$. This is always divisible by $4$, so $4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ for any integer $k$.\nThus, any even integer $B$ is a valid solution to the congruence system. The specific choice of $B$ affects which form within the resulting equivalence class is produced. We can choose the simplest solution, $B = 0$.\nSo, we take $b'' = 0$.\n\nThe third coefficient, $c''$, is determined by the requirement that the composed form must also have discriminant $D = -4$:\n$b''^2 - 4a''c'' = D$\n$0^2 - 4(1)c'' = -4$\n$-4c'' = -4$\n$c'' = 1$.\n\nThe resulting composed form is given by the coefficients $(a'', b'', c'') = (1, 0, 1)$.\nWe must check that this form is primitive: $\\gcd(a'', b'', c'') = \\gcd(1, 0, 1) = 1$. It is.\n\nThus, the composition of the principal form $(1, 0, 1)$ with itself yields the form $(1, 0, 1)$. This result is expected, since the class group $Cl(-4)$ has order $h(-4)=1$. The only element is the identity class, which must be its own inverse, and composing it with itself must yield the identity again.\n\nThe final answer requires the class number $h(-4)$ and the coefficients of the composed form $(a'', b'', c'')$.\n$h(-4) = 1$\n$(a'', b'', c'') = (1, 0, 1)$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3015035"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the basics, we now tackle a complete, non-trivial example with discriminant $D = -23$.

This involves finding all reduced forms of this discriminant, demonstrating that they form a complete set of representatives for the proper equivalence classes, and illustrating the group structure on these classes via Gauss composition. The final goal is to determine the class number $h(-23)$.\n\nA binary quadratic form is an expression $f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ with integer coefficients $a, b, c$. The discriminant is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. The form is positive definite if $\\Delta < 0$ and $a > 0$. It is primitive if $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$.

A positive definite form is called reduced if its coefficients satisfy the inequalities $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$, with the additional condition that if $|b|=a$ or $a=c$, then $b \\geq 0$. It is a fundamental theorem that every proper equivalence class of primitive positive definite forms contains exactly one reduced form.\n\nWe will proceed by addressing the four tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n1. Derivation of a bound on the leading coefficient $a$.\nFor a reduced form $(a,b,c)$, we have the conditions $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$. From the discriminant relation, we have $4ac = b^2 - \\Delta$. Since our discriminant is $\\Delta = -23$, this becomes $4ac = b^2 + 23$.\nThe condition $a \\leq c$ implies $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$.\nSubstituting the expression for $4ac$, we get $4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 23$.\nThe condition $|b| \\leq a$ implies $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nCombining these inequalities, we have:\n$$4a^2 \\leq a^2 + 23$$\n$$3a^2 \\leq 23$$\n$$a^2 \\leq \\frac{23}{3} \\approx 7.667$$\nSince the form is positive definite, $a$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, the possible integer values for $a$ are $a=1$ and $a=2$. This provides the required rigorous bound on the leading coefficient.\n\n2. Enumeration of all reduced forms.\nWe now search for all integer triples $(a,b,c)$ satisfying the primitivity condition $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$, the reduced conditions $|b|\\leq a \\leq c$ (with tie-breakers), and the discriminant equation $b^2 - 4ac = -23$. We use the bound on $a$ derived above. Note that from $b^2 - 4ac = -23$, we have $b^2 \\equiv -23 \\pmod 4$, which simplifies to $b^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This implies that $b$ must be an odd integer.\n\nCase 1: $a=1$.\nThe condition $|b| \\leq a=1$ and $b$ being odd implies $b \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nThe tie-breaking condition for $|b|=a$ states that we must have $b \\geq 0$. Thus, we must choose $b=1$.\nWe find $c$ from the discriminant equation:\n$b^2 - 4ac = -23 \\implies 1^2 - 4(1)c = -23 \\implies 1 - 4c = -23 \\implies 4c = 24 \\implies c=6$.\nThis gives the triple $(a,b,c)=(1,1,6)$.\nWe check the conditions:\n- Reduced: $|b|=1 \\leq a=1 \\leq c=6$. The tie-breaker $b=1 \\geq 0$ for $|b|=a$ is satisfied. The form is reduced.\n- Primitive: $\\gcd(1,1,6)=1$. The form is primitive.\nSo, $f_1(x,y) = x^2+xy+6y^2$ is a reduced primitive form. This is the principal form, as it represents $1$ at $(x,y)=(1,0)$.\n\nCase 2: $a=2$.\nThe condition $|b| \\leq a=2$ and $b$ being odd implies $b \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nIf $b=1$:\n$b^2 - 4ac = -23 \\implies 1^2 - 4(2)c = -23 \\implies 1 - 8c = -23 \\implies 8c = 24 \\implies c=3$.\nThis gives the triple $(a,b,c)=(2,1,3)$.\n- Reduced: $|b|=1 \\leq a=2 \\leq c=3$. The inequalities are strict, so no tie-breaker applies. The form is reduced.\n- Primitive: $\\gcd(2,1,3)=1$. The form is primitive.\nSo, $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2+xy+3y^2$ is a reduced primitive form.\n\nIf $b=-1$:\n$b^2 - 4ac = -23 \\implies (-1)^2 - 4(2)c = -23 \\implies 1 - 8c = -23 \\implies 8c = 24 \\implies c=3$.\nThis gives the triple $(a,b,c)=(2,-1,3)$.\n- Reduced: $|b|=1 \\leq a=2 \\leq c=3$. The inequalities are strict. The form is reduced.\n- Primitive: $\\gcd(2,-1,3)=1$. The form is primitive.\nSo, $f_3(x,y) = 2x^2-xy+3y^2$ is a reduced primitive form.\n\nOur exhaustive search based on the derived bound for $a$ has yielded exactly three reduced primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $\\Delta=-23$:\n- $f_1(x,y) = x^2+xy+6y^2$, corresponding to the triple $(1,1,6)$.\n- $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2+xy+3y^2$, corresponding to the triple $(2,1,3)$.\n- $f_3(x,y) = 2x^2-xy+3y^2$, corresponding to the triple $(2,-1,3)$.\nSince our search was exhaustive over all possibilities allowed by the reduction conditions, this list is complete.\n\n3. Argument for distinct equivalence classes.\nThe fundamental theorem on reduction of binary quadratic forms states that for a negative discriminant, each proper equivalence class contains exactly one reduced form. Since we have found three distinct reduced forms $f_1, f_2, f_3$, they must represent three distinct proper equivalence classes.\nIt is worth noting that the forms $f_2 = (2,1,3)$ and $f_3 = (2,-1,3)$ are not properly equivalent. Two forms $(a,b,c)$ and $(a,-b,c)$ with $b \\neq 0$ are properly equivalent if and only if one of the conditions $|b|=a$ or $a=c$ is met. For $f_2$ and $f_3$, we have $a=2, b=1, c=3$. We see that $|b|=1 \\neq a=2$ and $a=2 \\neq c=3$. Therefore, $f_2$ and $f_3$ are not properly equivalent. They are, however, improperly equivalent (equivalent via a transformation of determinant $-1$).\n\n4. Illustration of Gauss composition.\nThe set of proper equivalence classes forms a finite abelian group under Gauss composition, called the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\Delta)$. The identity element is the class of the principal form, $[f_1]$. We will compose the class of a non-principal form, $[f_2]$, with itself. This corresponds to computing $[f_2]^2$.\n\nLet the two forms to be composed be $F_1(x_1, y_1) = 2x_1^2 + x_1y_1 + 3y_1^2$ and $F_2(x_2, y_2) = 2x_2^2 + x_2y_2 + 3y_2^2$. We use Dirichlet's method of composition.\nSince the leading coefficients are not coprime ($\\gcd(2,2)=2$), we must first find a properly equivalent form to one of them. The form $F_2$ represents $F_2(0,1)=3$. Since $\\gcd(a_1, 3)=\\gcd(2,3)=1$, we can find a form properly equivalent to $F_2$ with leading coefficient $3$.\nThe transformation $(x,y) \\mapsto (-y,x)$, with matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, transforms a form $(a,b,c)$ to $(c,-b,a)$. Applying this to $F_2=(2,1,3)$ yields the properly equivalent form $(3, -1, 2)$. Let's call this $F_2'=(3,-1,2)$.\n\nNow we compose $F_1=(2,1,3)$ and $F_2'=(3,-1,2)$. The data are $a_1=2, b_1=1, c_1=3$ and $a_2=3, b_2=-1, c_2=2$.\nWe solve for an integer $B$ satisfying the congruences:\n- $B \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{2a_1} \\implies B \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$\n- $B \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{2a_2} \\implies B \\equiv -1 \\pmod 6$\n- $B^2 \\equiv \\Delta \\pmod{4a_1a_2} \\implies B^2 \\equiv -23 \\pmod{24} \\implies B^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$\n\nFrom $B \\equiv -1 \\pmod 6$, we can write $B = 6k - 1$.\nSubstituting this into the first congruence: $6k - 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4 \\implies 2k-1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4 \\implies 2k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. This is true for any odd integer $k$. Let's try $k=1$, which gives $B=5$.\nLet's check $B=5$ in all conditions:\n- $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ (True)\n- $5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 6$ (True)\n- $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod {24}$ (True)\nSo, we can take $B=5$.\n\nThe composed form, $H(x,y)=A X^2 + B XY + C Y^2$, has coefficients:\n- $A = a_1a_2 = (2)(3) = 6$.\n- $B = 5$.\n- $C = \\frac{B^2-\\Delta}{4A} = \\frac{5^2 - (-23)}{4(6)} = \\frac{25+23}{24} = \\frac{48}{24} = 2$.\nSo the composed form is $H(x,y)=6x^2+5xy+2y^2$.\n\nThis form is not reduced because $|b|=5 > a=6$ is false, but $a=6 > c=2$. We must reduce it.\nThe form is $(a,b,c)=(6,5,2)$.\n1. Since $a>c$, we apply the transformation $(x,y) \\mapsto (-y, x)$, corresponding to the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This maps $(a,b,c)$ to $(c,-b,a)$. The new form is $(2,-5,6)$.\n2. The new form $(a',b',c')=(2,-5,6)$ is not reduced because $|b'|=5 > a'=2$. We apply a transformation $(x,y) \\mapsto (x-ky, y)$ with matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -k \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $k$ is chosen to make the new middle coefficient $b'' = b' - 2a'k$ satisfy $|b''| \\leq a'$. We have $b'=-5$ and $a'=2$. We need $|-5-4k| \\leq 2$. Choosing $k=-1$ gives $|-5+4|=|-1|=1 \\leq 2$.\nThe new form's coefficients are $(a', b'-2a'k, a'k^2-b'k+c')$. With $k=-1$, the transformation becomes $(x,y)\\mapsto(x+y, y)$, and the new form is:\n$a'''=a'=2$.\n$b'''=b'-2a'(-1) = -5+4(1)=-1$.\n$c'''=a'(-1)^2-b'(-1)+c' = 2(1)-(-5)(-1)+6 = 2-5+6=3$.\nThe fully reduced form is $(2,-1,3)$, which is exactly our form $f_3(x,y)$.\n\nThis calculation, $[f_2] * [f_2] = [f_3]$, demonstrates closure within our set of classes. It also helps identify the inverse. In a group of order $3$, if $[f_2]$ is not the identity, its inverse must be $[f_2]^2$. Thus, $[f_3]$ is the inverse of $[f_2]$, which we write as $[f_2]^{-1} = [f_3]$. This is consistent with $[f_2]*[f_3] = [f_2]*[f_2]^2 = [f_2]^3$. Since the group has order $3$, Lagrange's theorem implies $[f_2]^3 = [f_1]$, the identity element. The group is cyclic of order $3$, generated by $[f_2]$ (and also by $[f_3]$).\n\nThe class number $h(\\Delta)$ is the number of proper equivalence classes, which is equal to the number of reduced forms.

Define $C$ via the relation $D = B^2 - 4AC$, which gives $C=\\frac{B^{2}-D}{4 A}$.\n\nWe will now analyze the two specified edge cases based on this construction.\n\n**Case 1: $a=1$**\n\nWe consider the form $f(x,y) = x^2 + bxy + c y^2$. The given form is primitive, which for $a=1$ is always true, as $\\gcd(1, b, c) = 1$.\n\nFirst, we simplify the expression for $g$:\n$$ g = \\gcd\\!\\left(a, a', \\frac{b+b'}{2}\\right) = \\gcd\\!\\left(1, a', \\frac{b+b'}{2}\\right) = 1 $$\nThe greatest common divisor of any set of integers including $1$ is always $1$.\n\nNext, we determine the coefficient $A$ of the composed form:\n$$ A = \\frac{a a'}{g^{2}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot a'}{1^{2}} = a' $$\n\nNow, we analyze the system of congruences for the middle coefficient $B$. Substituting $a=1$ and $g=1$:\n1.  $B \\equiv b \\pmod{\\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{1}} \\implies B \\equiv b \\pmod{2}$\n2.  $B \\equiv b' \\pmod{\\frac{2 a'}{1}} \\implies B \\equiv b' \\pmod{2a'}$\n3.  $B^{2} \\equiv D \\pmod{4 A} \\implies B^{2} \\equiv D \\pmod{4a'}$\n\nThe second congruence, $B \\equiv b' \\pmod{2a'}$, is the most restrictive. Any integer $B$ satisfying it must be of the form $B = b' + 2a'k$ for some integer $k$.\nLet us verify if such a $B$ satisfies the other two congruences.\nFor the first congruence: $b' + 2a'k \\equiv b \\pmod{2}$. Since $2a'k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, this simplifies to $b' \\equiv b \\pmod{2}$. As established earlier, $b$ and $b'$ must have the same parity, so this condition is always met.\nFor the third congruence: we have $B \\equiv b' \\pmod{2a'}$, which implies $B^2 \\equiv b'^2 \\pmod{4a'}$. From the discriminant identity, $D = b'^{2} - 4a'c'$, we can write $b'^2 = D + 4a'c'$. This implies $b'^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a'}$. Therefore, if $B^2 \\equiv b'^2 \\pmod{4a'}$, it follows that $B^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a'}$. The third congruence is thus satisfied for any $B$ that satisfies the second.\n\nThe system of congruences effectively reduces to $B \\equiv b' \\pmod{2a'}$. The simplest choice for an integer $B$ satisfying this condition is to take $k=0$, which yields:\n$$ B = b' $$\n\nWith this choice for $B$, we now determine the final coefficient $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{B^{2}-D}{4 A} = \\frac{(b')^{2}-D}{4 a'} $$\nSubstituting the discriminant identity $D = b'^{2}-4a'c'$:\n$$ C = \\frac{b'^{2} - (b'^{2}-4a'c')}{4 a'} = \\frac{4a'c'}{4 a'} $$\nSince $f'(x,y)$ is a binary quadratic form, its leading coefficient $a'$ is a non-zero integer. Thus, we can simplify the fraction:\n$$ C = c' $$\nSo, for the case $a=1$, the coefficients are $B=b'$ and $C=c'$. The resulting composed form is $F(x,y)=a'x^2+b'xy+c'y^2$, which is identical to $f'(x,y)$. This is consistent with the fact that any form with $a=1$ is in the principal class, and composing with the principal class acts as an identity operation.\n\n**Case 2: $a'=1$**\n\nThis case is perfectly symmetric to the first case. We consider the form $f'(x,y) = x^2 + b'xy + c'y^2$.\n\nFirst, we simplify the expression for $g$:\n$$ g = \\gcd\\!\\left(a, a', \\frac{b+b'}{2}\\right) = \\gcd\\!\\left(a, 1, \\frac{b+b'}{2}\\right) = 1 $$\n\nNext, we determine the coefficient $A$:\n$$ A = \\frac{a a'}{g^{2}} = \\frac{a \\cdot 1}{1^{2}} = a $$\n\nNow, we analyze the system of congruences for $B$. Substituting $a'=1$ and $g=1$:\n1.  $B \\equiv b \\pmod{\\frac{2 a}{1}} \\implies B \\equiv b \\pmod{2a}$\n2.  $B \\equiv b' \\pmod{\\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{1}} \\implies B \\equiv b' \\pmod{2}$\n3.  $B^{2} \\equiv D \\pmod{4 A} \\implies B^{2} \\equiv D \\pmod{4a}$\n\nThe first congruence, $B \\equiv b \\pmod{2a}$, is the most restrictive. An integer $B$ satisfying it must be of the form $B = b + 2ak$ for some integer $k$.\nLet us verify if such a $B$ satisfies the other two congruences.\nFor the second congruence: $b + 2ak \\equiv b' \\pmod{2}$. This simplifies to $b \\equiv b' \\pmod{2}$, which is always true.\nFor the third congruence: we have $B \\equiv b \\pmod{2a}$, which implies $B^2 \\equiv b^2 \\pmod{4a}$. From the discriminant identity, $D = b^{2} - 4ac$, we have $b^2 = D + 4ac$. This implies $b^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a}$. Therefore, if $B^2 \\equiv b^2 \\pmod{4a}$, it follows that $B^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a}$. The third congruence is thus satisfied.\n\nThe system of congruences reduces to $B \\equiv b \\pmod{2a}$. We choose the simplest integer representative for $B$ by taking $k=0$:\n$$ B = b $$\n\nWith this choice for $B$, we determine $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{B^{2}-D}{4 A} = \\frac{b^{2}-D}{4 a} $$\nSubstituting the discriminant identity $D = b^{2}-4ac$:\n$$ C = \\frac{b^{2} - (b^{2}-4ac)}{4 a} = \\frac{4ac}{4 a} $$\nSince $f(x,y)$ is a binary quadratic form, $a \\neq 0$. We can simplify:\n$$ C = c $$\nSo, for the case $a'=1$, the coefficients are $B=b$ and $C=c$. The resulting composed form is $F(x,y)=ax^2+bxy+cy^2$, which is identical to $f(x,y)$.\n\nIn summary, the derived explicit expressions are:\n- When $a=1$: $B=b'$ and $C=c'$.\n- When $a'=1$: $B=b$ and $C=c$.\nWe present these four results in the requested row matrix format.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} b' & c' & b & c \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3015044"}]}
