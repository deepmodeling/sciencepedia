No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the class number, $h_{K}$, of the Gaussian quadratic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. The derivation must proceed by first establishing that the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a Euclidean domain, and then using this fact to prove that every ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is principal.\n\nFirst, we identify the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. For a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, we have $d=-1$, which satisfies $-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[i] = \\{m+ni \\mid m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This is the ring of Gaussian integers.\n\nThe field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}: K \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is defined for an element $\\alpha = a+bi \\in K$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) as $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = a^2+b^2$. The problem states that the norm is related to complex conjugation by $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha\\overline{\\alpha}$, where $\\overline{\\alpha} = a-bi$. For elements in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, say $\\gamma = m+ni$, the norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma) = m^2+n^2$, which is a non-negative integer. The norm is multiplicative, i.e., $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha\\beta) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$.\n\nThe first step is to show that $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a Euclidean domain with respect to the norm function. This means that for any two elements $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with $\\beta \\neq 0$, there exist a quotient $q \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ and a remainder $r \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that $\\alpha = q\\beta + r$ and $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(r) < N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$.\n\nLet $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $\\beta \\neq 0$. Consider their ratio in the field $K$:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} = x+yi $$\nwhere $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The problem directs us to use the existence of a nearest Gaussian integer. For any complex number $z = x+yi$, there exists a Gaussian integer $q=m+ni$ such that its real and imaginary parts are the closest integers to the real and imaginary parts of $z$. Specifically, we choose integers $m$ and $n$ such that $|x-m| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ and $|y-n| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. This Gaussian integer $q=m+ni$ will be our quotient.\n\nWe define the remainder $r$ by rearranging the division equation: $r = \\alpha - q\\beta$. Since $\\alpha, q, \\beta$ are all in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, the remainder $r$ is also in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$.\nWe can express $r$ as:\n$$ r = \\alpha - q\\beta = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\\beta - q\\beta = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} - q\\right)\\beta = ((x+yi)-(m+ni))\\beta = ((x-m) + (y-n)i)\\beta $$\nNow, we must verify the condition on the norm of the remainder. Using the multiplicativity of the norm:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(r) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(((x-m)+(y-n)i)\\beta) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}((x-m)+(y-n)i) \\cdot N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) $$\nThe norm of the first factor is:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}((x-m)+(y-n)i) = (x-m)^2 + (y-n)^2 $$\nBy our choice of $m$ and $n$, we have $(x-m)^2 \\le (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $(y-n)^2 \\le (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$. Thus,\n$$ (x-m)^2 + (y-n)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(r)$:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(r) \\le \\frac{1}{2} N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) $$\nSince $\\beta \\neq 0$, its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$ is a positive integer. Therefore, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(r) < N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$. This completes the proof that $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean domain.\n\nNext, we use this Euclidean structure to show that every ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is principal. An integral domain in which every ideal is principal is called a Principal Ideal Domain (PID). A standard theorem states that every Euclidean domain is a PID. The problem asks for a constructive proof based on a minimal-norm argument.\n\nLet $I$ be an arbitrary nonzero ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Since $I$ is nonzero, it contains at least one nonzero element. Consider the set of norms of all nonzero elements in $I$:\n$$ S = \\{N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma) \\mid \\gamma \\in I, \\gamma \\neq 0\\} $$\nSince the norm of any nonzero element in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a positive integer, $S$ is a non-empty subset of the positive integers. By the Well-Ordering Principle, $S$ must have a minimum element. Let this minimum be $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$ for some nonzero element $\\beta \\in I$.\n\nWe claim that $I$ is generated by this element $\\beta$, i.e., $I = (\\beta) = \\{\\delta \\beta \\mid \\delta \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}\\}$.\nFirst, since $\\beta \\in I$ and $I$ is an ideal, any multiple $\\delta\\beta$ (for $\\delta \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$) must also be in $I$. This establishes that $(\\beta) \\subseteq I$.\n\nTo show the reverse inclusion, $I \\subseteq (\\beta)$, let $\\alpha$ be any element of $I$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a Euclidean domain, we can divide $\\alpha$ by $\\beta$ (which is nonzero). This yields a quotient $q \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ and a remainder $r \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that:\n$$ \\alpha = q\\beta + r, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(r) < N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta) $$\nWe can write the remainder as $r = \\alpha - q\\beta$. Since $\\alpha \\in I$ and $\\beta \\in I$, $q\\beta$ is also in $I$. As an ideal is closed under subtraction, $r = \\alpha - q\\beta$ must be an element of $I$.\n\nSo we have $r \\in I$ with $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(r) < N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$. However, $\\beta$ was chosen such that its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta)$ is the minimum norm for any *nonzero* element of $I$. If $r$ were nonzero, it would be an element of $I$ with a norm smaller than the minimum, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility is that the remainder $r$ must be zero.\n\nIf $r=0$, then the division equation becomes $\\alpha = q\\beta$. This shows that any element $\\alpha \\in I$ is a multiple of $\\beta$. Hence, $\\alpha \\in (\\beta)$, which proves $I \\subseteq (\\beta)$.\nCombining both inclusions, we have $I = (\\beta)$. As $I$ was an arbitrary ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, we have shown that every ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a principal ideal.\n\nFinally, we deduce the class number $h_{K}$. The ideal class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ is the group of equivalence classes of fractional ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, where the group operation is ideal multiplication. The identity element of this group is the class of principal ideals. Two ideals $I_1$ and $I_2$ are in the same class if there exist nonzero principal ideals $(\\alpha)$ and $(\\beta)$ such that $(\\alpha)I_1 = (\\beta)I_2$.\n\nWe have proven that every ideal $I$ of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is principal. This means that for any ideal $I$, there exists an element $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that $I=(\\beta)$. Therefore, every ideal belongs to the equivalence class of principal ideals. The ideal class group thus contains only one element, the identity class. A group with only one element is the trivial group.\n\nThe class number $h_{K}$ is defined as the order (cardinality) of the ideal class group, $h_{K} = |\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})|$. Since the group is trivial, its order is $1$.\n\nTherefore, the class number of $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3010115"}, {"introduction": "While some quadratic fields have class number one, many do not, and their class groups can have rich structures.

Since $d = -23 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers of $K$ is given by $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}\\right]$. Let $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}$.

Since $N(\\mathfrak{a})$ must be an integer, we only need to consider integral ideals with norm less than or equal to $\\lfloor M_K \\rfloor = 3$. The class group is therefore generated by the classes of prime ideals whose norms are the primes $p \\le 3$, which are $p=2$ and $p=3$.\n\n**Step 3: Prime Ideal Factorization**\n\nTo analyze the factorization of the rational primes $p=2$ and $p=3$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, we use Dedekind's criterion with the minimal polynomial of the generator $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}$.\nThe trace of $\\omega$ is $\\text{Tr}(\\omega) = \\omega + \\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2} + \\frac{1-\\sqrt{-23}}{2} = 1$.\nThe norm of $\\omega$ is $N(\\omega) = \\omega\\bar{\\omega} = \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{-23}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1-(-23)}{4} = \\frac{24}{4}=6$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\omega$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $f(x) = x^2 - \\text{Tr}(\\omega)x + N(\\omega) = x^2 - x + 6$.\n\n- **Factorization of $(2)$**: We reduce $f(x)$ modulo $2$:\n$$x^2 - x + 6 \\equiv x^2+x \\equiv x(x+1) \\pmod{2}$$\nThe polynomial splits into two distinct linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Thus, the prime $2$ splits in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ into a product of two distinct prime ideals of norm $2$.\n$$(2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2 \\mathfrak{p}_2'$$\nwhere $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, \\omega)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2' = (2, \\omega-1)$. Note that $(2, \\omega-1)=(2,\\omega+1)$. We have $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)=N(\\mathfrak{p}_2')=2$.\n\n- **Factorization of $(3)$**: We reduce $f(x)$ modulo $3$:\n$$x^2 - x + 6 \\equiv x^2-x \\equiv x(x-1) \\pmod{3}$$\nThe polynomial splits into two distinct linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Thus, the prime $3$ splits in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ into a product of two distinct prime ideals of norm $3$.\n$$(3) = \\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mathfrak{p}_3'$$\nwhere $\\mathfrak{p}_3 = (3, \\omega)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3' = (3, \\omega-1)$. We have $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3)=N(\\mathfrak{p}_3')=3$.\n\n**Step 4: Testing for Principal Ideals**\n\nAn ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is principal if $\\mathfrak{a}=(\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. If so, $N(\\mathfrak{a}) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$. An element $\\alpha=a+b\\omega \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) has norm:\n$$N(\\alpha) = N(a+b\\omega) = (a+b\\omega)(a+b\\bar{\\omega}) = a^2 + ab(\\omega+\\bar{\\omega}) + b^2\\omega\\bar{\\omega} = a^2+ab+6b^2$$\nThis can also be written as $N(\\alpha) = (a+\\frac{b}{2})^2 + \\frac{23}{4}b^2$. Since the norm is a sum of squares, it is always non-negative.\n\n- **Are prime ideals of norm $2$ principal?**\nWe seek $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $N(\\alpha)=2$. This requires solving $a^2+ab+6b^2=2$ for integers $a, b$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=2$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nIf $b \\ne 0$, then $|b| \\ge 1$. The norm is $N(\\alpha)=(a+\\frac{b}{2})^2+\\frac{23}{4}b^2 \\ge \\frac{23}{4}b^2 \\ge \\frac{23}{4} = 5.75$.\nSince $5.75>2$, there are no integer solutions for $a, b$ when $b \\ne 0$.\nTherefore, there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$. The ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$ are not principal.\n\n- **Are prime ideals of norm $3$ principal?**\nWe seek $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $N(\\alpha)=3$. This requires solving $a^2+ab+6b^2=3$.\nUsing the same argument as above, if $b \\ne 0$, $N(\\alpha) \\ge 5.75 > 3$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=3$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nTherefore, there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $3$. The ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3'$ are not principal.\n\n**Step 5: Relations in the Class Group**\n\nThe class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by the classes $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$.\nFrom $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2 \\mathfrak{p}_2'$, we have $[\\mathfrak{p}_2][\\mathfrak{p}_2'] = [ (2) ] = 1$, where $1$ is the identity class (the class of principal ideals). Thus $[\\mathfrak{p}_2'] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^{-1}$. Since $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field, the class of a conjugate ideal $\\bar{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is the inverse of the class of $\\mathfrak{a}$. Indeed, $\\mathfrak{p}_2' = (2, \\omega-1) = (2, \\bar{\\omega}) = \\bar{\\mathfrak{p}}_2$.\n\nWe must determine the order of the generator $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\n- Is $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = 1$? This would imply $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$ is principal. $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2^2)=N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)^2 = 2^2=4$. We check for elements of norm $4$: $a^2+ab+6b^2=4$. Again, if $b \\ne 0$, $N(\\alpha) \\ge 5.75 > 4$. If $b=0$, $a^2=4 \\implies a=\\pm 2$. The elements $\\pm 2$ generate the ideal $(2)=\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_2'$. Since $\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\ne \\mathfrak{p}_2'$, we have $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 \\ne (2)$. As there are no other principal ideals of norm $4$, $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$ is not principal. So, $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 \\ne 1$.\n\n- Is $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^3 = 1$? This would imply $\\mathfrak{p}_2^3$ is principal. We look for an element of norm $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2^3)=8$. We solve $a^2+ab+6b^2=8$.\nIf $b=\\pm 1$, the equation becomes $a^2 \\pm a + 6 = 8 \\implies a^2\\pm a - 2 = 0$.\nFor $b=1$, $a^2+a-2=0 \\implies (a+2)(a-1)=0$, so $a=1$ or $a=-2$.\nThis gives two elements with norm $8$: $\\alpha_1 = 1+\\omega$ and $\\alpha_2 = -2+\\omega$.\nLet's analyze the principal ideal $(\\alpha_1)=(1+\\omega)$. $N(1+\\omega)=8=2^3$. So $(1+\\omega)$ must be a product of three prime ideals above $2$.\nTo find its factorization, we check if $1+\\omega$ is in $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ or $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$.\nIn the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$, $\\omega$ maps to the root $0$. Thus $1+\\omega \\mapsto 1+0=1 \\not\\equiv 0$. So $1+\\omega \\notin \\mathfrak{p}_2$.\nIn the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2' \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$, $\\omega$ maps to the root $1$. Thus $1+\\omega \\mapsto 1+1=2 \\equiv 0$. So $1+\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2'$.\nSince $(1+\\omega)$ is divisible by $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$ but not by $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, its factorization must be $(1+\\omega) = (\\mathfrak{p}_2')^3$.\nThis implies that $(\\mathfrak{p}_2')^3$ is a principal ideal, so $[\\mathfrak{p}_2']^3=1$ in the class group. Since $[\\mathfrak{p}_2']\\ne 1$, the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2']$ is exactly $3$. As $[\\mathfrak{p}_2'] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^{-1}$, the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is also $3$.\n\nNow we find the relation between $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$. Consider the element $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, which has norm $N(\\omega)=6$. The principal ideal $(\\omega)$ has norm $6$, so its prime factorization is $(\\omega)=\\mathfrak{q}_2\\mathfrak{q}_3$, where $\\mathfrak{q}_2$ is a prime ideal above $2$ and $\\mathfrak{q}_3$ is a prime ideal above $3$.\n- Divisibility by a prime ideal above $2$: $\\mathfrak{p}_2=(2,\\omega)$. Clearly $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2$. So $\\mathfrak{q}_2 = \\mathfrak{p}_2$.\n- Divisibility by a prime ideal above $3$: $\\mathfrak{p}_3=(3,\\omega)$. Clearly $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_3$. So $\\mathfrak{q}_3 = \\mathfrak{p}_3$.\nThus, we have the ideal equality $(\\omega) = \\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3$.\nThis gives a relation in the class group:\n$$[(\\omega)] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2][\\mathfrak{p}_3] = 1$$\nThis implies that $[\\mathfrak{p}_3] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^{-1}$. Using the fact that $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ has order $3$, we can write this as $[\\mathfrak{p}_3] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2$.\n\n**Conclusion: The Class Number**\n\nThe class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by the classes $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$. We have found that $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$ is a power of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. Therefore, the class group is generated solely by $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ (or any other non-trivial class). It is a cyclic group.\nWe have established that the order of the generator $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is $3$.\nThus, the class group is $Cl(K) = \\{[\\mathcal{O}_K], [\\mathfrak{p}_2], [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2\\}$, which is a cyclic group of order $3$.\nThe class number $h_K$ is the order of the class group.\n$$h_K = |Cl(K)| = 3$$\nThe analysis confirms that the class group is cyclic, generated by an element of order $3$.

Substituting $ac = \\frac{b^2+84}{4}$:\n$$a^2 \\leq \\frac{b^2+84}{4} \\implies 4a^2 \\leq b^2+84$$\nUsing $|b| \\leq a$, we have $b^2 \\leq a^2$. Therefore:\n$$4a^2 \\leq a^2 + 84 \\implies 3a^2 \\leq 84 \\implies a^2 \\leq 28$$\nThis gives an upper bound for $a$: $a \\leq \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29$. Since $a$ must be a positive integer, $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. We are also given that $b$ must be even. We now systematically check possible values for $a$ and $b$.\n\n-   If $a=1$: The condition $|b| \\leq a$ implies $b=0$ (as $b$ is even).\n    $0^2 - 4(1)c = -84 \\implies 4c = 84 \\implies c=21$.\n    The form is $[1, 0, 21]$. We check the conditions: $a=1, c=21 \\implies a>0, c>0$. Reduction: $|0| \\leq 1 \\leq 21$. Primitivity: $\\gcd(1, 0, 21) = 1$. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n-   If $a=2$: The condition $|b| \\leq a$ allows for $b \\in \\{0, \\pm 2\\}$.\n    If $b=0$: $0^2 - 4(2)c = -84 \\implies 8c=84$, no integer solution for $c$.\n    If $b=\\pm 2$: $(\\pm 2)^2 - 4(2)c = -84 \\implies 4 - 8c = -84 \\implies 8c=88 \\implies c=11$.\n    The forms are $[2, 2, 11]$ and $[2, -2, 11]$. Reduction for $[2, 2, 11]$: $|2| \\leq 2 \\leq 11$. Reduction for $[2, -2, 11]$: $|-2| \\leq 2 \\leq 11$. Both are reduced. Primitivity: $\\gcd(2, \\pm 2, 11)=1$. Both are primitive.\n\n-   If $a=3$: The condition $|b| \\leq a$ allows for $b \\in \\{0, \\pm 2\\}$.\n    If $b=0$: $0^2 - 4(3)c = -84 \\implies 12c=84 \\implies c=7$.\n    The form is $[3, 0, 7]$. Reduction: $|0| \\leq 3 \\leq 7$. Primitivity: $\\gcd(3, 0, 7)=1$. Conditions met.\n    If $b=\\pm 2$: $(\\pm 2)^2 - 4(3)c = -84 \\implies 4-12c=-84 \\implies 12c=88$, no integer solution for $c$.\n\n-   If $a=4$: The condition $|b| \\leq a$ allows for $b \\in \\{0, \\pm 2, \\pm 4\\}$.\n    $b=0: -16c=-84$, no integer $c$.\n    $b=\\pm 2: 4-16c=-84 \\implies 16c=88$, no integer $c$.\n    $b=\\pm 4: 16-16c=-84 \\implies 16c=100$, no integer $c$.\n\n-   If $a=5$: The condition $|b| \\leq a$ allows for $b \\in \\{0, \\pm 2, \\pm 4\\}$.\n    $b=0: -20c=-84$, no integer $c$.\n    $b=\\pm 2: 4-20c=-84 \\implies 20c=88$, no integer $c$.\n    $b=\\pm 4: (\\pm 4)^2 - 4(5)c=-84 \\implies 16-20c=-84 \\implies 20c=100 \\implies c=5$.\n    The forms are $[5, 4, 5]$ and $[5, -4, 5]$. Reduction for $[5, 4, 5]$: $|4| \\leq 5 \\leq 5$. Reduction for $[5,-4,5]$: $|-4| \\leq 5 \\leq 5$. Both are reduced. Primitivity: $\\gcd(5, \\pm 4, 5)=1$. Both are primitive.\n\nTwo forms $[a, b, c]$ and $[a, -b, c]$ are properly equivalent if and only if $b=0$, $|b|=a$, or $a=c$. Such forms are called ambiguous.\n-   $[1, 0, 21]$ and $[3, 0, 7]$ have $b=0$. They represent distinct classes.\n-   For $[2, \\pm 2, 11]$, we have $|b|=a=2$. Thus, $[2, 2, 11]$ and $[2, -2, 11]$ are properly equivalent and belong to the same class.\n-   For $[5, \\pm 4, 5]$, we have $a=c=5$. Thus, $[5, 4, 5]$ and $[5, -4, 5]$ are properly equivalent and belong to the same class.\n\nTherefore, there are $4$ distinct classes of forms. A set of representatives for these classes is:\n$C_1$: $[1, 0, 21]$ (the principal class)\n$C_2$: $[3, 0, 7]$\n$C_3$: $[2, 2, 11]$\n$C_4$: $[5, 4, 5]$\n\nThe number of classes is the class number, $h(-84)=4$.\n\n**Part 2: Group Structure of the Form Class Group**\n\nThe form class group $G$ has order $4$. Groups of order $4$ are either cyclic ($\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$) or the Klein four-group ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$). We can determine the structure by examining the orders of the elements. An element (class) has order $2$ if it is not the identity and is its own inverse. The inverse of the class of $[a, b, c]$ is the class of $[a, -b, c]$. A class is its own inverse if $[a, b, c]$ is properly equivalent to $[a, -b, c]$, which occurs if the form is ambiguous ($b=0$, $|b|=a$, or $a=c$).\n\n-   $C_1 = [[1, 0, 21]]$: This is the identity element, its order is $1$.\n-   $C_2 = [[3, 0, 7]]$: The representative form is ambiguous ($b=0$), so this class has order $2$.\n-   $C_3 = [[2, 2, 11]]$: The representative form is ambiguous ($|b|=a$), so this class has order $2$.\n-   $C_4 = [[5, 4, 5]]$: The representative form is ambiguous ($a=c$), so this class has order $2$.\n\nSince all three non-identity elements have order $2$, the group cannot be cyclic. The group must be the Klein four-group, $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The reduced classes of order $2$ are $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$, represented by $[3, 0, 7]$, $[2, 2, 11]$, and $[5, 4, 5]$ respectively.\n\n**Part 3: Correspondence with the Ideal Class Group**\n\nThere is a canonical isomorphism between the form class group of discriminant $D$ and the ideal class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O})$ of the quadratic order $\\mathcal{O}$ with discriminant $D$. In our case, $D=-84$ is the discriminant of the maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-21}]$, so we have an isomorphism between the form class group and $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$.\n\nThe mapping from a form class $[[a,b,c]]$ to an ideal class is given by sending the form to the ideal $\\mathfrak{a} = \\left(a, \\frac{-b+\\sqrt{D}}{2}\\right)$. The norm of this ideal is $N(\\mathfrak{a}) = a$.\n\nLet's verify this for our representatives: $D = -84$, $\\sqrt{D} = 2\\sqrt{-21}$.\n-   $C_1=[[1,0,21]] \\mapsto \\mathfrak{a}_1 = \\left(1, \\frac{0+2\\sqrt{-21}}{2}\\right) = (1, \\sqrt{-21})=\\mathcal{O}_K$. This is the principal ideal, representing the identity element in $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$.\n\n-   $C_2=[[3,0,7]] \\mapsto \\mathfrak{a}_2 = \\left(3, \\frac{0+2\\sqrt{-21}}{2}\\right) = (3, \\sqrt{-21})$. The norm is $N(\\mathfrak{a}_2)=3$. To check if it's principal, we see if there is an element $\\alpha = x+y\\sqrt{-21} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $N(\\alpha) = x^2+21y^2=3$. This equation has no integer solutions for $x,y$. So $\\mathfrak{a}_2$ is not principal. Since the corresponding form class has order 2, the ideal class must also have order 2.\n\n-   $C_3=[[2,2,11]] \\mapsto \\mathfrak{a}_3 = \\left(2, \\frac{-2+2\\sqrt{-21}}{2}\\right) = (2, -1+\\sqrt{-21})$. The norm is $N(\\mathfrak{a}_3)=2$. It is not principal as $x^2+21y^2=2$ has no integer solutions. Since the form class $C_3$ has order $2$, we know $[\\mathfrak{a}_3]$ has order $2$.\n\n-   $C_4=[[5,4,5]] \\mapsto \\mathfrak{a}_4 = \\left(5, \\frac{-4+2\\sqrt{-21}}{2}\\right) = (5, -2+\\sqrt{-21})$. The norm is $N(\\mathfrak{a}_4)=5$. It is not principal as $x^2+21y^2=5$ has no integer solutions. Since its corresponding form is ambiguous, the ideal class must be its own inverse. As the ideal is not principal, its class must have order 2.\n\nThe four classes of forms correspond to four distinct ideal classes in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. These are $[\\mathcal{O}_K]$, $[\\mathfrak{a}_2]$, $[\\mathfrak{a}_3]$, and $[\\mathfrak{a}_4]$. The ideals have norms $1, 3, 2, 5$, which ensures the classes are distinct.\nThe isomorphism is verified: the form class group and the ideal class group both have order $4$ and the structure of the Klein four-group.\nThe class number is the order of the ideal class group, $h_K=|\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})|$. Based on our calculation, this is $4$.\n\nFinal Answer: The class number $h_K = |\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)|$ is the number of reduced classes of forms, which we found to be $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3010133"}]}
