Let the final variables be $u,v,w$. We set:\n$x' = u$, $y' = c_2 v$, $z' = c_3 w$.\nThe form becomes $Q = 10u^2 + \\frac{7}{5}(c_2 v)^2 + \\frac{30}{7}(c_3 w)^2 = 10u^2 + \\frac{7}{5}c_2^2 v^2 + \\frac{30}{7}c_3^2 w^2$.\nTo make the coefficients integers, we can choose rational numbers $c_2, c_3$. Let $c_2 = 5$. The coefficient of $v^2$ becomes $\\frac{7}{5}(5^2) = 35$.\nLet $c_3 = 7$. The coefficient of $w^2$ becomes $\\frac{30}{7}(7^2) = 210$.\nSo we have the diagonal form with integer coefficients:\n$$Q(u,v,w) = 10u^2 + 35v^2 + 210w^2.$$\nThe change of variables from $(x,y,z)$ to $(u,v,w)$ is:\n$u = x' = x + \\frac{3}{5}y + \\frac{1}{5}z$\n$v = \\frac{1}{c_2}y' = \\frac{1}{5}\\left(y + \\frac{9}{7}z\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}y + \\frac{9}{35}z$\n$w = \\frac{1}{c_3}z' = \\frac{1}{7}z$\nThis is an invertible rational linear change of variables. The resulting diagonal coefficients are $d_1 = 10$, $d_2 = 35$, $d_3 = 210$.\n\nFinally, we determine the classes of these coefficients in the square class group $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}/(\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times})^2$ and their squarefree integer representatives.\nFor a rational number $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$, its class $[q]$ is found by writing $q=s \\cdot r^2$ where $s$ is a squarefree integer and $r \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$.

This analysis will identify whether there is a local obstruction at the prime $p=3$ to the representability of $3$ as a sum of two squares over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe quadratic form $q(x,y) = x^{2}+y^{2}$ can be recognized as the norm map associated with the quadratic field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})/\\mathbb{Q}$. For an element $z = x+y\\sqrt{-1}$ in this extension, its norm is given by $N(z) = (x+y\\sqrt{-1})(x-y\\sqrt{-1}) = x^{2} - (-1)y^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}$.\nThis interpretation extends to local fields. The question of whether $n=3$ is represented by the form $q(x,y)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}$ is equivalent to asking if $3$ is in the image of the norm map $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}_{3}}: K \\to \\mathbb{Q}_{3}$, where $K = \\mathbb{Q}_{3}(\\sqrt{-1})$. In other words, we need to determine if there exists an element $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{3}(\\sqrt{-1})$ such that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}_{3}}(\\alpha) = 3$.\n\nThe Hilbert symbol provides a direct tool to answer this question. The Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_{v}$ over a local field $\\mathbb{Q}_{v}$ is defined to be $1$ if the equation $z^{2}-ax^{2}-by^{2}=0$ has a non-trivial solution $(x,y,z)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_{v}$, and $-1$ otherwise. A fundamental property of the Hilbert symbol is that for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{v}^{\\times}$, $(a,b)_{v}=1$ if and only if $a$ is a norm of an element from the quadratic extension field $\\mathbb{Q}_{v}(\\sqrt{b})$.\n\nTo apply this property to our problem, we set $a=3$, $b=-1$, and the local field to be $\\mathbb{Q}_{v} = \\mathbb{Q}_{3}$. The question of whether $3$ is a norm from the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}(\\sqrt{-1})$ is precisely determined by the value of the Hilbert symbol $(3,-1)_{3}$. If $(3,-1)_{3}=1$, then $3$ is a norm and the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=3$ has a solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}$. If $(3,-1)_{3}=-1$, then $3$ is not a norm and no such solution exists.\n\nWe now proceed to compute $(3,-1)_{3}$. For an odd prime $p$, and for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\\times}$ written as $a=p^{v_{p}(a)}u$ and $b=p^{v_{p}(b)}v$ where $u$ and $v$ are $p$-adic units, the Hilbert symbol is given by the formula:\n$$ (a,b)_{p} = (-1)^{v_{p}(a)v_{p}(b)\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\left( \\frac{u}{p} \\right)^{v_{p}(b)} \\left( \\frac{v}{p} \\right)^{v_{p}(a)} $$\nHere, $\\left(\\frac{\\cdot}{p}\\right)$ denotes the Legendre symbol.\n\nIn our case, $p=3$, $a=3$, and $b=-1$.\nFirst, we determine the $3$-adic valuations and the unit parts.\nFor $a=3$, the $3$-adic valuation is $v_{3}(3)=1$. The unit part is $u=1$.\nFor $b=-1$, the $3$-adic valuation is $v_{3}(-1)=0$. The unit part is $v=-1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the Hilbert symbol:\n$$ (3,-1)_{3} = (-1)^{(1)(0)\\frac{3-1}{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{0} \\left( \\frac{-1}{3} \\right)^{1} $$\nLet's evaluate each term:\n- The first term is $(-1)^{0} = 1$.\n- The second term is $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{0} = 1$.\n- The third term is $\\left( \\frac{-1}{3} \\right)^{1} = \\left( \\frac{-1}{3} \\right)$.\n\nSo, the value of the Hilbert symbol is reduced to the value of the Legendre symbol $\\left( \\frac{-1}{3} \\right)$. The Legendre symbol $\\left( \\frac{k}{p} \\right)$ for an odd prime $p$ is $1$ if $k$ is a non-zero quadratic residue modulo $p$, and $-1$ if $k$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$.\nWe can determine $\\left( \\frac{-1}{3} \\right)$ using the property $\\left( \\frac{-1}{p} \\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$. For $p=3$, this gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{-1}{3} \\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{3-1}{2}} = (-1)^{1} = -1 $$\nAlternatively, we can check the squares modulo $3$: $1^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $2^{2} \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The only non-zero quadratic residue is $1$. Since $-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $-1$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $3$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n$$ (3,-1)_{3} = \\left( \\frac{-1}{3} \\right) = -1 $$\n\nThe fact that $(3,-1)_{3}=-1$ implies that $3$ is not a norm from the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}(\\sqrt{-1})$. This directly proves that the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=3$ has no solution for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{3}$. This non-solvability in $\\mathbb{Q}_{3}$ is the \"local obstruction\" at the prime $p=3$. According to the Hasse-Minkowski theorem (which states that a quadratic form represents a number over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it represents it over every completion $\\mathbb{Q}_{v}$), this local obstruction implies that $3$ cannot be written as the sum of two squares of rational numbers.

The solution will be derived from the foundational definitions as requested.\n\nFirst, we determine the discriminant class $\\Delta$.\nThe discriminant of a diagonal quadratic form $q = \\langle a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n \\rangle$ is defined as the product of its coefficients, $\\det(q) = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_n$.

We have $3^2 \\in (\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times})^2$. Thus, the class of $-306$ is the same as the class of $-1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 17 = -34$.\nThe value $-34$ is a squarefree integer. Therefore, the squarefree representative for the discriminant class is $\\Delta = -34$.\n\nNext, we compute the Hasse invariants $\\epsilon_v(q)$ for $v \\in \\{\\infty, 2, 3, 17\\}$.\nThe Hasse invariant of a diagonal quadratic form $q = \\langle a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n \\rangle$ over a local field $\\mathbb{Q}_v$ is defined as the product of Hilbert symbols of all pairs of coefficients:\n$$ \\epsilon_v(q) = \\prod_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} (a_i, a_j)_v $$\nThe Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_v$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_v^{\\times}$ is equal to $1$ if the equation $ax^2 + by^2 = z^2$ has a non-trivial solution $(x,y,z)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$, and $-1$ otherwise.\nFor our form $q = \\langle -1, 9, 17, 2 \\rangle$, the Hasse invariant is the product of six Hilbert symbols:\n$$ \\epsilon_v(q) = (-1, 9)_v (-1, 17)_v (-1, 2)_v (9, 17)_v (9, 2)_v (17, 2)_v $$\nA fundamental property of the Hilbert symbol is that $(a, c^2)_v = 1$ for any $a, c \\in \\mathbb{Q}_v^{\\times}$. Since the coefficient $a_2 = 9 = 3^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ (and thus in every $\\mathbb{Q}_v$), all Hilbert symbols involving $a_2$ are equal to $1$:\n$$ (-1, 9)_v = (-1, 3^2)_v = 1 $$\n$$ (9, 17)_v = (3^2, 17)_v = 1 $$\n$$ (9, 2)_v = (3^2, 2)_v = 1 $$\nThe expression for the Hasse invariant simplifies to:\n$$ \\epsilon_v(q) = (-1, 17)_v (-1, 2)_v (17, 2)_v $$\nWe now compute this value for each specified place $v$.\n\n1.

Since $17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, we have $(\\frac{-1}{17}) = 1$.\n    -   $(-1, 2)_{17} = 1$ because $-1$ and $2$ are units in $\\mathbb{Z}_{17}^\\times$.\n    -   $(17, 2)_{17} = (2, 17)_{17} = (\\frac{2}{17})$. By the second supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity, $(\\frac{2}{p}) = (-1)^{(p^2-1)/8}$. For $p=17$, we have $(17^2-1)/8 = (289-1)/8 = 288/8 = 36$. Thus, $(\\frac{2}{17}) = (-1)^{36} = 1$.\n    Therefore, $\\epsilon_{17}(q) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\n4.  Hasse invariant at $v = 2$ ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$):\n    We use the following standard formulas for Hilbert symbols over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, where $u$ is a $2$-adic unit (an odd integer):\n    -   $(-1, u)_2 = 1$ if and only if $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n    -   $(2, u)_2 = 1$ if and only if $u \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{8}$.\n    -   $(-1, 2)_2 = 1$.\n    We evaluate the terms:\n    -   $(-1, 17)_2$: Here $u=17$. Since $17 = 4 \\cdot 4 + 1$, we have $17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(-1, 17)_2 = 1$.\n    -   $(-1, 2)_2$: This is a standard identity, equal to $1$.\n    -   $(17, 2)_2 = (2, 17)_2$: Here $u=17$. Since $17 = 2 \\cdot 8 + 1$, we have $17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. Thus, $(2, 17)_2 = 1$.\n    Therefore, $\\epsilon_2(q) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nIn summary, the computed invariants are:\n-   Discriminant class representative: $\\Delta = -34$.\n-   Hasse invariant at infinity: $\\epsilon_\\infty = 1$.\n-   Hasse invariant at $v=2$: $\\epsilon_2 = 1$.\n-   Hasse invariant at $v=3$: $\\epsilon_3 = 1$.\n-   Hasse invariant at $v=17$: $\\epsilon_{17} = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix containing these values in the specified order: $(\\Delta, \\epsilon_{\\infty}, \\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_3, \\epsilon_{17})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -34 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3026693"}]}
