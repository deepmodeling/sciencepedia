Let $p$ be a fixed prime number.\n\nFirst, we establish whether $(s_{N})$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to each absolute value. A sequence $(x_{n})$ is Cauchy if for any $\\varepsilon  0$, there exists an integer $K$ such that for all $m, n \\geq K$, the distance $d(x_{m}, x_{n})  \\varepsilon$.\n\n**Analysis with the usual Archimedean absolute value $|\\cdot|$**\nLet $m, N$ be integers with $m  N$. The distance between $s_{m}$ and $s_{N}$ is given by:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}| = \\left| \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{m} p^{n}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^{n}\\right) \\right| = \\left| \\sum_{n=N+1}^{m} p^{n} \\right|$$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, $p \\geq 2$. Thus, all terms $p^{n}$ are positive. The absolute value can be removed:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}| = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{m} p^{n} = p^{N+1} + p^{N+2} + \\dots + p^{m}$$\nTo test the Cauchy condition, we must be able to make this distance arbitrarily small by choosing $N$ large enough. However, the sum is always greater than or equal to its first term:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}| \\geq p^{N+1}$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, the term $p^{N+1}$ grows without bound since $p \\geq 2$. For instance, if we choose $\\varepsilon = 1$, there is no $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m  N$, $|s_{m} - s_{N}|  1$, because $p^{N+1} \\geq 2^{N+1} \\geq 2^{1} = 2  1$ for all $N \\geq 0$. Therefore, the sequence $(s_{N})$ is **not** a Cauchy sequence with respect to the usual absolute value $|\\cdot|$.\n\nConsequently, the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{n}$ does not converge in $\\mathbb{R}$. The question of absolute summability concerns the convergence of $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |p^{n}|$. Since $p  0$, $|p^{n}| = p^{n}$. The series is $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{n}$, which is a geometric series with ratio $r=p$. Since $p \\geq 2$, the condition for convergence $|r|1$ is not met. Thus, the series is **not** absolutely summable.\n\n**Analysis with the $p$-adic absolute value $|\\cdot|_{p}$**\nAgain, let $m, N$ be integers with $m  N$. The distance is now $|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p}$.\n$$s_{m} - s_{N} = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{m} p^{n} = p^{N+1} + p^{N+2} + \\dots + p^{m} = p^{N+1} (1 + p + \\dots + p^{m-N-1})$$\nUsing the multiplicative property of the $p$-adic absolute value, $|x y|_{p} = |x|_{p} |y|_{p}$:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p} = |p^{N+1}|_{p} |1 + p + \\dots + p^{m-N-1}|_{p}$$\nFrom the definition $|a|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(a)}$, we have $|p^{N+1}|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(p^{N+1})} = p^{-(N+1)}$.\nNow, let $K = 1 + p + \\dots + p^{m-N-1}$. $K$ is an integer. To find $|K|_{p}$, we need its $p$-adic valuation, $v_{p}(K)$. Notice that $K \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, which means that $K$ is not divisible by $p$. Thus, $v_{p}(K) = 0$.\nThis implies $|K|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(K)} = p^{-0} = 1$.\nSubstituting these results back, we get:\n$$|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p} = p^{-(N+1)} \\cdot 1 = p^{-(N+1)}$$\nTo check the Cauchy condition, for any $\\varepsilon  0$, we need to find an integer $K$ such that for all $m  N \\geq K$, $|s_{m} - s_{N}|_{p}  \\varepsilon$. This inequality becomes $p^{-(N+1)}  \\varepsilon$. As $N \\to \\infty$, $N+1 \\to \\infty$, so $-(N+1) \\to -\\infty$, and $p^{-(N+1)} \\to 0$. Thus, for any given $\\varepsilon  0$, we can always find a sufficiently large $K$ that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the sequence $(s_{N})$ is **a Cauchy sequence** with respect to the $p$-adic absolute value $|\\cdot|_{p}$.\n\n**Finding the limit in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$**\nThe problem states that $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is the completion of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to $|\\cdot|_{p}$. Since $(s_{N})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{Q}, |\\cdot|_{p})$, it must converge to a limit in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. Let this limit be $S = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} s_{N}$. The problem asks to identify this limit as an element of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe use the well-known formula for the partial sum of a geometric series:\n$$s_{N} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^{n} = \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nWe can now take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$ in the $p$-adic metric.\n$$S = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} s_{N} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nSince the algebraic operations are continuous with respect to the metric, we can write:\n$$S = \\frac{\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p^{N+1})}{\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p)} = \\frac{1 - \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1}}{1 - p}$$\nWe must evaluate $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. A sequence $(a_n)$ converges to $L$ if $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |a_n - L|_p = 0$. Here, we test for convergence to $0$:\n$$\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} |p^{N+1} - 0|_{p} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} |p^{N+1}|_{p} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{-(N+1)} = 0$$\nThus, $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N+1} = 0$ in the $p$-adic metric.\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 - p} = \\frac{1}{1-p}$$\nThis limit is a rational number, so it lies in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.

An element $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a unit (i.e., its inverse $x^{-1}$ exists in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$) if and only if its $p$-adic valuation $v_p(x)$ is $0$, or equivalently, its $p$-adic absolute value $|x|_p$ is $1$. Let's evaluate $|1+p|_p$. Using the strong triangle inequality (or ultrametric inequality), which states that for any $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$, $|a+b|_p \\le \\max(|a|_p, |b|_p)$, with equality holding if $|a|_p \\neq |b|_p$.\nFor the element $1+p$, we have $|1|_p = p^{-v_p(1)} = p^0 = 1$ and $|p|_p = p^{-1}$. Since $|1|_p \\neq |p|_p$, we have:\n$$|1+p|_p = \\max(|1|_p, |p|_p) = \\max(1, p^{-1}) = 1$$\nSince $|1+p|_p=1$, its $p$-adic valuation is $0$, and thus $1+p$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Its inverse, $(1+p)^{-1}$, exists and is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\nTo find the series for $(1+p)^{-1}$, we can use the analogy with the geometric series in real numbers, $\\frac{1}{1-x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n$, which converges for $|x|1$. We write $(1+p)^{-1}$ as $\\frac{1}{1-(-p)}$. This suggests the formal series:\n$$S = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-p)^n = 1 - p + p^2 - p^3 + \\dots$$\nFor this series to converge in the $p$-adic metric, the $p$-adic absolute value of its terms must approach $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Let's examine the $n$-th term, $a_n = (-p)^n$. Its $p$-adic absolute value is:\n$$|a_n|_p = |(-p)^n|_p = |(-1)^n p^n|_p = |-1|_p^n |p^n|_p$$\nSince $-1$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ for any prime $p$, we have $v_p(-1)=0$, so $|-1|_p = p^0 = 1$. The absolute value of $p^n$ is:\n$$|p^n|_p = (p^{-1})^n = p^{-n}$$\nTherefore, the absolute value of the $n$-th term is:\n$$|a_n|_p = 1^n \\cdot p^{-n} = p^{-n}$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $p^{-n} \\to 0$ because $p$ is a prime, so $p \\ge 2$. In any non-archimedean complete space, a series $\\sum a_n$ converges if and only if $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |a_n| = 0$. Since this condition is satisfied, the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-p)^n$ converges in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\nNext, we must show that this series indeed converges to $(1+p)^{-1}$. Consider the partial sum $S_N = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} (-p)^n$. Using the formula for a finite geometric series:\n$$S_N = \\frac{1 - (-p)^{N+1}}{1 - (-p)} = \\frac{1 - (-p)^{N+1}}{1+p}$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, we need to evaluate the limit of $S_N$ in the $p$-adic metric.\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} S_N = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{1 - (-p)^{N+1}}{1+p} = \\frac{1 - \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}(-p)^{N+1}}{1+p}$$\nThe limit term $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}(-p)^{N+1}$ converges to $0$ because its $p$-adic absolute value $|(-p)^{N+1}|_p = p^{-(N+1)}$ approaches $0$ as $N \\to \\infty$.\nThus, the sum of the series is:\n$$S = \\frac{1 - 0}{1+p} = \\frac{1}{1+p} = (1+p)^{-1}$$\nThis confirms that the explicit $p$-adic series for $(1+p)^{-1}$ is $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-p)^n$.\n\nNow we determine the truncation to precision $p^k$. This means finding an expression $T_k$ such that $|(1+p)^{-1} - T_k|_p \\le p^{-k}$. A natural choice for the truncation is the partial sum up to the $(k-1)$-th term:\n$$T_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-p)^n$$\nTo justify this, we must bound the $p$-adic size of the remainder term, which is the difference between the full series and the truncation:\n$$R_k = (1+p)^{-1} - T_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-p)^n - \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-p)^n = \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} (-p)^n$$\nThe remainder series is $R_k = (-p)^k + (-p)^{k+1} + (-p)^{k+2} + \\dots$.\nLet's evaluate the $p$-adic absolute value of this remainder. The terms of the remainder series have $p$-adic absolute values:\n$$|(-p)^k|_p = p^{-k}$$\n$$|(-p)^{k+1}|_p = p^{-(k+1)}$$\n$$|(-p)^{k+2}|_p = p^{-(k+2)}$$\nand so on.\nWe have a sequence of strictly decreasing absolute values: $p^{-k}  p^{-(k+1)}  p^{-(k+2)}  \\dots$. A fundamental property of non-archimedean absolute values is that the absolute value of a sum is equal to the maximum of the absolute values of the terms, provided that maximum is attained by a single term. Here, the maximum is $|(-p)^k|_p = p^{-k}$.\nTherefore, the absolute value of the remainder is:\n$$|R_k|_p = \\left| \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} (-p)^n \\right|_p = \\max_{n \\ge k} \\{|(-p)^n|_p\\} = |(-p)^k|_p = p^{-k}$$\nSince $|(1+p)^{-1} - T_k|_p = p^{-k}$, the condition $|(1+p)^{-1} - T_k|_p \\le p^{-k}$ is satisfied. This means that $T_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-p)^n$ is indeed the truncation of $(1+p)^{-1}$ to precision $p^k$. In terms of congruences, this is equivalent to $(1+p)^{-1} \\equiv \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-p)^n \\pmod{p^k}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the coefficients of the truncated series $T_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-1)^n p^n$. For a given truncation to precision $p^k$, the series is a polynomial in $p$ of degree $k-1$. The coefficients are $c_n = (-1)^n$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, k-1$.\n- **Dependence on $k$**: The number of non-zero coefficients in the truncated series is $k$. As $k$ increases, new terms are added to the polynomial, but the coefficients of the lower-power terms ($p^0, p^1, \\dots, p^{k-2}$) remain unchanged. The value of the $n$-th coefficient, $c_n$, is $(-1)^n$ and does not depend on $k$, provided $n  k$.\n- **Ordinary absolute values**: The ordinary absolute value of the $n$-th coefficient is $|c_n| = |(-1)^n| = 1$. This is a constant for all $n$.\n- **$p$-adic valuations**: The $p$-adic valuation of the $n$-th coefficient is $v_p(c_n) = v_p((-1)^n) = n \\cdot v_p(-1)$. For any prime $p$, $-1$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, which means its expansion does not have any factors of $p$. Thus, $v_p(-1)=0$. This implies $v_p(c_n) = 0$ for all $n$. The $p$-adic valuations of all coefficients are $0$.\n\nThe required closed-form analytic expression for the truncation to precision $p^k$ is the finite sum that defines it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-p)^n}$$", "id": "3030847"}]}
