The definitions of $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, the $p$-adic absolute value and valuation, quadratic extensions, and the Krasner radius are all standard. The conditions imposed on $d$ are consistent and define a standard quadratic extension. The problem is self-contained, objective, and mathematically sound. The request to express the answer \"in terms of $p$ and $v_{p}$\" is interpreted as requiring a formula involving the symbol $p$ and the valuation function $v_{p}$ applied to a specific numerical argument. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\nThe problem requires the determination of the Krasner radius $r(\\alpha)$ for $\\alpha=\\sqrt{d}$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K=\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is given as $f(x) = x^{2}-d$. The roots of this polynomial are $\\alpha = \\sqrt{d}$ and $\\alpha' = -\\sqrt{d}$. Since $d$ is not a square in $K$, $\\alpha \\notin K$, and thus $\\alpha \\neq -\\alpha$ (otherwise $2\\alpha=0$, implying $\\alpha=0$ and $d=0$, but $d$ is a unit, a contradiction). So, the only conjugate of $\\alpha$ over $K$ that is different from $\\alpha$ is $\\alpha' = -\\alpha$.\n\nAccording to the definition provided, the Krasner radius $r(\\alpha)$ is the minimum of the distances $|\\alpha - \\alpha'|_{p}$ over all distinct conjugates $\\alpha'$. Since there is only one such conjugate, the minimum is simply the distance to that conjugate:\n$$r(\\alpha) = |\\alpha - (-\\alpha)|_{p} = |2\\alpha|_{p}$$\nThe $p$-adic absolute value is multiplicative. This property extends to finite extensions of $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$r(\\alpha) = |2|_{p} |\\alpha|_{p}$$\nTo proceed, we must compute the values of $|2|_{p}$ and $|\\alpha|_{p}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine $|\\alpha|_{p}$. The absolute value $|\\cdot|_{p}$ on $L=K(\\alpha)$ is the unique extension of the absolute value on $K$. A fundamental property of this extension is that for any element $y \\in L$, $|y^n|_p = |y|_p^n$ for any integer $n$. We have $\\alpha^2 = d$. Therefore:\n$$|\\alpha^2|_{p} = |\\alpha|_{p}^2 = |d|_{p}$$\nWe are given that $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\\times}$. An element is a $p$-adic unit if and only if its $p$-adic absolute value is $1$. Thus, $|d|_{p} = 1$.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$|\\alpha|_{p}^2 = 1$$\nSince an absolute value is non-negative, we must have $|\\alpha|_{p} = 1$.\n\nNow we can substitute this result back into the expression for $r(\\alpha)$:\n$$r(\\alpha) = |2|_{p} \\cdot 1 = |2|_{p}$$\nThe problem asks for a closed-form expression in terms of $p$ and the valuation $v_{p}$. The definition of the $p$-adic absolute value is $|x|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(x)}$ for any $x \\in K$. Applying this to the element $2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$:\n$$|2|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(2)}$$\nTherefore, the general expression for the Krasner radius is:\n$$r(\\alpha) = p^{-v_{p}(2)}$$\nThis is the single symbolic expression for $r(\\alpha)$ that is valid for any prime $p$.\n\nThe problem also requires an analysis of how the case $p=2$ affects the result. We can analyze the value of $v_{p}(2)$ for different primes $p$.\n\nCase 1: $p \\neq 2$.\nFor any prime $p$ not equal to $2$, the integer $2$ is not divisible by $p$. This means that $2$ is a unit in the ring of $p$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. The $p$-adic valuation of a unit is, by definition, $0$. So, for $p \\neq 2$, $v_{p}(2) = 0$.\nIn this case, the Krasner radius is:\n$$r(\\alpha) = p^{-v_{p}(2)} = p^{-0} = 1$$\n\nCase 2: $p=2$.\nFor the prime $p=2$, the integer $2$ is the prime element of the field $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. The $2$-adic valuation is normalized such that $v_{2}(2)=1$.\nIn this case, the Krasner radius is:\n$$r(\\alpha) = 2^{-v_{2}(2)} = 2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis analysis shows that the quantity $|\\alpha-(-\\alpha)|_{p}=|2\\alpha|_{p}=|2|_p$ is indeed affected by the choice of $p$. It equals $1$ for all odd primes and $1/2$ for the prime $2$. The general formula $p^{-v_{p}(2)}$ correctly encapsulates both outcomes.\nThe quantity $d$ being a non-square unit is crucial for defining the extension $L/K$, but its specific value does not influence the final result for $r(\\alpha)$, as long as it is a unit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p^{-v_{p}(2)}}$$", "id": "3016495"}, {"introduction": "Having calculated a Krasner radius, we now explore its significance in a more nuanced scenario involving a totally ramified extension.

The prime is fixed as $p=3$.\n\nThe $3$-adic valuation is denoted by $v_3(\\cdot)$, and the $3$-adic absolute value is $|\\cdot|_3$, normalized such that $|3|_3 = 3^{-1}$. For any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_3$, $|x|_3 = 3^{-v_3(x)}$.\n\n**Part 1: Eisenstein criterion, ramification, and $|\\alpha|_3$**\n\nWe are given the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 - 3 \\in \\mathbb{Q}_3[x]$. The coefficients can be considered as elements of the ring of $3$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. The coefficients are $a_2=1$, $a_1=0$, and $a_0=-3$.\n\nWe apply the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility at the prime $p=3$:\n1.  The leading coefficient $a_2=1$ is a $3$-adic unit. In terms of valuation, $v_3(a_2)=v_3(1)=0$, so $3$ does not divide $a_2$. This condition is satisfied.\n2.  All other coefficients must be divisible by $3$. Here, the only other non-zero coefficient is $a_0=-3$. We have $v_3(a_1) = v_3(0) = \\infty$ and $v_3(a_0)=v_3(-3)=v_3(3)=1$. Since $v_3(a_1) \\ge 1$ and $v_3(a_0) \\ge 1$, this condition is satisfied.\n3.  The constant term $a_0$ must not be divisible by $3^2=9$. We have $v_3(a_0)=1$, so $a_0$ is not divisible by $9$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nSince all three conditions of the Eisenstein criterion are met for $p=3$, the polynomial $f(x)=x^2-3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_3$.\n\nLet $\\alpha \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_3$ be a root of $f(x)$. The field extension $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)/\\mathbb{Q}_3$ has degree equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$, which is $2$.\nA standard theorem in algebraic number theory states that an extension generated by a root of an Eisenstein polynomial is totally ramified. Since $f(x)$ is an Eisenstein polynomial of degree $2$, the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)/\\mathbb{Q}_3$ is a totally ramified quadratic extension. The ramification index is $e=2$ and the residue field degree is $f=1$.\n\nTo compute $|\\alpha|_3$, we use the defining relation $f(\\alpha)=0$, which is $\\alpha^2 - 3 = 0$, or $\\alpha^2=3$. We take the $3$-adic absolute value of both sides:\n$$|\\alpha^2|_3 = |3|_3$$\nUsing the property $|x^n|_p = |x|_p^n$ and the normalization $|3|_3 = 3^{-1}$, we get:\n$$|\\alpha|_3^2 = 3^{-1}$$\nTaking the square root of this real-valued equation, we find:\n$$|\\alpha|_3 = (3^{-1})^{1/2} = 3^{-1/2}$$\nIn terms of valuations, this corresponds to $v_3(\\alpha) = 1/2$. The fact that the valuation group of $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$ contains a non-integer value ($1/2$) confirms that the extension is ramified.\n\n**Part 2: Krasner bound $\\delta(\\alpha)$**\n\nThe Krasner bound $\\delta(\\alpha)$ is the minimum $p$-adic distance from $\\alpha$ to any of its Galois conjugates other than itself. The polynomial $f(x)=x^2-3$ has degree $2$, so $\\alpha$ has exactly one other conjugate. Since $f(x)$ has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}_3$, if $\\alpha$ is a root, then so is $-\\alpha$, because $(-\\alpha)^2 - 3 = \\alpha^2 - 3 = 0$. As $\\alpha^2=3 \\neq 0$, we have $\\alpha \\neq 0$, so $\\alpha \\neq -\\alpha$. Thus, the unique non-trivial conjugate of $\\alpha$ is $\\sigma(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$.\n\nThe Krasner bound is therefore:\n$$\\delta(\\alpha) = |\\sigma(\\alpha) - \\alpha|_3 = |-\\alpha - \\alpha|_3 = |-2\\alpha|_3$$\nUsing the properties of the non-Archimedean absolute value:\n$$\\delta(\\alpha) = |-1|_3 \\cdot |2|_3 \\cdot |\\alpha|_3$$\nWe evaluate each term:\n-   $|-1|_3 = 1$.\n-   Since $3$ is a prime and $3 \\nmid 2$, $2$ is a $3$-adic unit. Therefore, $|2|_3 = 3^{-v_3(2)} = 3^0 = 1$.\n-   From Part 1, we computed $|\\alpha|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get the Krasner bound:\n$$\\delta(\\alpha) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3^{-1/2} = 3^{-1/2}$$\n\n**Part 3: Compute $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3$ and comparison**\n\nWe are given $\\beta = 0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}_3$. We compute the distance $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3$:\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = |0-\\alpha|_3 = |-\\alpha|_3 = |-1|_3 \\cdot |\\alpha|_3 = 1 \\cdot |\\alpha|_3 = |\\alpha|_3$$\nUsing our result from Part 1, this is:\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$$\nComparing this with the Krasner bound from Part 2, we see that:\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = \\delta(\\alpha) = 3^{-1/2}$$\nThe problem points out that the Krasner bound is \"not strictly satisfied\". This refers to Krasner's Lemma, which states:\n*If $\\alpha \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $\\beta \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ satisfies $|\\beta-\\alpha|_p < \\delta(\\alpha)$, then $\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_p(\\beta)$.*\n\nIn our case, with $p=3$, we have found that $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = \\delta(\\alpha)$. The strict inequality required by Krasner's Lemma is not satisfied. Therefore, the conclusion of the lemma, $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$, is not guaranteed.\n\nWe can check the extensions directly to see that they differ.\n-   The extension generated by $\\beta$ is $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta) = \\mathbb{Q}_3(0) = \\mathbb{Q}_3$. This is the base field itself, a degree $1$ extension.\n-   The extension generated by $\\alpha$ is $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$, which, as established in Part 1, is a degree $2$ extension over $\\mathbb{Q}_3$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$ is a proper extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_3$, it is manifest that $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$ and, in particular, $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\not\\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$. This situation demonstrates that the strict inequality in Krasner's Lemma is a crucial condition. When the distance from $\\beta$ to $\\alpha$ is exactly the minimal distance from $\\alpha$ to its conjugates, it is possible for the conclusion of the lemma to fail, as it does in this case.\n\nThe final answer is the value of $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3$.\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3^{-1/2}}$$", "id": "3020585"}, {"introduction": "This final practice solidifies your skills by applying them to a more complex, higher-degree extension over the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.
