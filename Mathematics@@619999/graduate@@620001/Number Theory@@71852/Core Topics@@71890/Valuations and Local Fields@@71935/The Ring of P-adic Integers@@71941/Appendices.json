No rounding is required; provide exact expressions.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in elementary $p$-adic analysis. It is well-posed, scientifically grounded in standard number theory, and contains all necessary definitions and conditions to derive a unique, meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the canonical $p$-adic expansion, which is a series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n p^n$ with coefficients (or \"digits\") $a_n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$, for two given rational numbers. The problem states that $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a complete metric space with respect to the non-Archimedean absolute value $|\\cdot|_p$. A fundamental result in such a space is that an infinite series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x_n$ converges if and only if its terms approach zero, i.e., $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |x_n|_p = 0$. We will use this criterion to establish convergence.\n\nFirst, we must confirm that the numbers in question, $\\frac{1}{1-p}$ and $\\frac{1}{1-p^k}$, are indeed elements of the ring of $p$-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_p = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p : |x|_p \\le 1\\}$. This is a precondition for the existence of a $p$-adic expansion with only non-negative powers of $p$.\n\nFor the number $\\frac{1}{1-p}$, we evaluate its $p$-adic absolute value. The integer $1-p = -(p-1)$ is not divisible by the prime $p$, since $p-1$ is not. Thus, its $p$-adic valuation is $v_p(1-p)=0$. According to the definition of the $p$-adic absolute value, we have:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right|_p = \\frac{|1|_p}{|1-p|_p} = \\frac{p^{-v_p(1)}}{p^{-v_p(1-p)}} = \\frac{p^{-0}}{p^{-0}} = 1\n$$\nSince $\\left|\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right|_p = 1 \\le 1$, this number is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\nSimilarly, for the number $\\frac{1}{1-p^k}$ where $k$ is a positive integer, the integer $1-p^k = -(p^k-1)$ is not divisible by $p$. Thus, $v_p(1-p^k)=0$. Its $p$-adic absolute value is:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{1-p^k}\\right|_p = \\frac{|1|_p}{|1-p^k|_p} = \\frac{p^{-0}}{p^{-0}} = 1\n$$\nSince $\\left|\\frac{1}{1-p^k}\\right|_p = 1 \\le 1$, this number is also an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\nHaving established that both numbers are $p$-adic integers, we proceed to find their series expansions.\n\n**Part 1: The expansion of $\\frac{1}{1-p}$**\n\nWe are guided by the formal geometric series identity $\\frac{1}{1-x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n$. Let us consider this series with $x=p$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^n = 1 + p + p^2 + \\dots\n$$\nThe general term of this series is $x_n = p^n$. Its $p$-adic absolute value is $|x_n|_p = |p^n|_p = p^{-n}$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $p^{-n} \\to 0$. Since the terms of the series converge to zero, the series $S$ converges in the complete field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nTo prove that the sum is $\\frac{1}{1-p}$, we analyze the sequence of partial sums, $S_N = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^n$. This is a finite geometric series, whose sum is known to be:\n$$\nS_N = \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1-p}\n$$\nThe sum of the infinite series $S$ is, by definition, the limit of the sequence of partial sums: $S = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} S_N$. We evaluate the distance between $S_N$ and our target value $\\frac{1}{1-p}$:\n$$\n\\left| S_N - \\frac{1}{1-p} \\right|_p = \\left| \\frac{1 - p^{N+1}}{1-p} - \\frac{1}{1-p} \\right|_p = \\left| \\frac{-p^{N+1}}{1-p} \\right|_p\n$$\nUsing the properties of the non-Archimedean absolute value, $|a/b|_p = |a|_p/|b|_p$ and $|-1|_p=1$:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{-p^{N+1}}{1-p} \\right|_p = \\frac{|p^{N+1}|_p}{|1-p|_p} = \\frac{p^{-(N+1)}}{1} = p^{-(N+1)}\n$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, $N+1 \\to \\infty$, and thus $p^{-(N+1)} \\to 0$. This demonstrates that $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} S_N = \\frac{1}{1-p}$.\nTherefore, the $p$-adic representation of $\\frac{1}{1-p}$ is indeed the series:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1-p} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 1 \\cdot p^n\n$$\nThe coefficients of this expansion are $a_n = 1$ for all $n \\ge 0$. Since $p$ is a prime, $p \\ge 2$, so the digit $1$ is valid as it belongs to the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\n\nThe sequence of digits in the base-$p$ expansion is $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots) = (1, 1, 1, \\dots)$. This is a purely periodic sequence with period $1$. The repeating block is $(1)$.\n\n**Part 2: The expansion of $\\frac{1}{1-p^k}$**\n\nWe apply the same logic. We consider the geometric series with ratio $r = p^k$:\n$$\nT = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (p^k)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{kn} = 1 + p^k + p^{2k} + \\dots\n$$\nThe general term is $x_n = p^{kn}$. Its $p$-adic absolute value is $|x_n|_p = |p^{kn}|_p = p^{-kn}$. Since $k$ is a fixed positive integer, as $n \\to \\infty$, $kn \\to \\infty$, and $p^{-kn} \\to 0$. The series $T$ therefore converges in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nThe partial sums are $T_N = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} p^{kn}$. This is a finite geometric series with sum:\n$$\nT_N = \\frac{1 - (p^k)^{N+1}}{1-p^k} = \\frac{1 - p^{k(N+1)}}{1-p^k}\n$$\nWe show that the limit of $T_N$ is $\\frac{1}{1-p^k}$ by examining the distance:\n$$\n\\left| T_N - \\frac{1}{1-p^k} \\right|_p = \\left| \\frac{1 - p^{k(N+1)}}{1-p^k} - \\frac{1}{1-p^k} \\right|_p = \\left| \\frac{-p^{k(N+1)}}{1-p^k} \\right|_p\n$$\nEvaluating this expression:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{-p^{k(N+1)}}{1-p^k} \\right|_p = \\frac{|p^{k(N+1)}|_p}{|1-p^k|_p} = \\frac{p^{-k(N+1)}}{1} = p^{-k(N+1)}\n$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, $k(N+1) \\to \\infty$, so $p^{-k(N+1)} \\to 0$. This proves that $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} T_N = \\frac{1}{1-p^k}$.\n\nThe series expansion is $\\frac{1}{1-p^k} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{kn}$. To see this as a standard $p$-adic expansion $\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} a_m p^m$, we define the coefficients $a_m$:\n$$\na_m = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } m \\text{ is a multiple of } k \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThese coefficients $a_m$ are either $0$ or $1$, which are valid digits in any base $p \\ge 2$.\n\nThe sequence of digits is $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots)$. Writing it out, we have $a_0=1$, $a_1=\\dots=a_{k-1}=0$, $a_k=1$, $a_{k+1}=\\dots=a_{2k-1}=0$, and so on. The sequence of digits is:\n$$\n(\\underbrace{1, 0, \\dots, 0}_{k \\text{ digits}}, \\underbrace{1, 0, \\dots, 0}_{k \\text{ digits}}, \\dots)\n$$\nThis is a purely periodic sequence with period $k$. The repeating block is $(1, 0, \\dots, 0)$, which has length $k$.\n\nIn summary, we have used the convergence property of series in the complete non-Archimedean field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ and the formula for a geometric series to find the $p$-adic expansions of the given rational numbers. The results are canonical as all coefficients lie in the required set.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{n} & \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{kn}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3029250"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to represent numbers in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, we now turn to identifying some of its most important inhabitants: the roots of unity.
