Since there are no roots of $f(x)$ modulo $3$, it follows immediately that there are no simple roots of $f(x)$ modulo $3$.\n\nThe absence of a root modulo $3$ is a critical obstruction to the existence of a root in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. To rigorously justify this, we relate any hypothetical root in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ to its image under the canonical reduction homomorphism $\\pi: \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3$ such that $f(\\alpha)=0$. By definition of a root, this means $\\alpha^2+1=0$ in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThe map $\\pi$ is a ring homomorphism. Applying this homomorphism to the equation $f(\\alpha)=0$ gives:\n$$\\pi(\\alpha^2+1) = \\pi(0)$$\nBecause $\\pi$ is a homomorphism, it preserves addition and multiplication.

We are given the singular condition, $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ and $f'(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, which in terms of the $p$-adic valuation $v_p$ is $v_p(f(a_0)) \\ge 1$ and $v_p(f'(a_0)) \\ge 1$. We seek sufficient conditions on the valuations of $f(a_0)$ and $f'(a_0)$ to guarantee the existence of a true root $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ near $a_0$.\n\nCase A: $v_p(f'(a_0))$ is finite.\nLet $j=v_p(f(a_0))$ and $k=v_p(f'(a_0))$, with $j \\ge 1$ and $k \\ge 1$. A standard approach is to use a $p$-adic version of the Newton-Raphson method to construct a sequence of better approximations:\n$$ a_{n+1} = a_n - \\frac{f(a_n)}{f'(a_n)} $$\nLet's analyze the first step, from $a_0$ to $a_1$. Let $\\delta_0 = a_1 - a_0 = -f(a_0)/f'(a_0)$.\nThe valuation of this correction term is $v_p(\\delta_0) = v_p(f(a_0)) - v_p(f'(a_0)) = j - k$.\nFor the sequence $(a_n)$ to converge, we require $v_p(a_{n+1}-a_n) \\to \\infty$, so we should at least have $j-k > 0$, i.e., $j>k$.\nLet's examine the derivative at $a_1 = a_0 + \\delta_0$. By Taylor's theorem for polynomials:\n$$ f'(a_1) = f'(a_0+\\delta_0) = f'(a_0) + f''(a_0)\\delta_0 + \\frac{f'''(a_0)}{2}\\delta_0^2 + \\dots $$\nThe valuation of the second term is $v_p(f''(a_0)\\delta_0) = v_p(f''(a_0)) + v_p(\\delta_0) \\ge 0 + j-k$. To ensure that the valuation of the derivative remains stable, $v_p(f'(a_1))=v_p(f'(a_0))=k$, we need the subsequent terms in the expansion to have a strictly larger valuation than the first term. This means we require $v_p(f''(a_0)\\delta_0) > k$, which implies $j-k > k$, or $j > 2k$.\nNow let's examine $f(a_1)$:\n$$ f(a_1) = f(a_0+\\delta_0) = f(a_0) + f'(a_0)\\delta_0 + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}\\delta_0^2 + \\dots $$\nBy construction of $\\delta_0$, the first two terms cancel: $f(a_0) + f'(a_0)(-\\frac{f(a_0)}{f'(a_0)}) = 0$. So,\n$$ f(a_1) = \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}\\delta_0^2 + \\dots $$\nAssuming the term shown is dominant, we get $v_p(f(a_1)) \\ge v_p(f''(a_0)) + v_p(1/2) + 2v_p(\\delta_0)$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $v_p(2)=0$. As $f(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$, its derivatives have coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, so $v_p(f''(a_0)) \\ge 0$. Thus, $v_p(f(a_1)) \\ge 2v_p(\\delta_0) = 2(j-k)$. For the error $f(a_n)$ to decrease (in the p-adic sense, for its valuation to increase), we need $v_p(f(a_1)) > v_p(f(a_0))$, which is $2(j-k) > j$, or $j > 2k$.\nThis reveals the sufficient condition: if $v_p(f(a_0)) > 2v_p(f'(a_0))$, the Newton-Raphson sequence converges to a root $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. This root will be unique within the disk $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p : |z-a_0|_p \\le p^{-(j-k)}\\}$. A stronger inequality provides a more precise and uniquely determined lift.\n\nCase B: $f'(a_0) = 0$.\nThe Newton-Raphson method is undefined. We use a different approach based on Taylor's theorem. Let $x$ be a potential root near $a_0$. Write $x=a_0+y$.\n$$ f(x) = f(a_0+y) = f(a_0) + f'(a_0)y + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}y^2 + \\frac{f'''(a_0)}{6}y^3 + \\dots $$\nSince $f'(a_0)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ f(x) = f(a_0) + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}y^2 + \\dots $$\nWe want to solve $f(x)=0$. If we can neglect the higher-order terms in $y$, we are led to solve approximately $f(a_0) + \\frac{f''(a_0)}{2}y^2 = 0$, which gives $y^2 = -\\frac{2f(a_0)}{f''(a_0)}$.\nThis suggests a sufficient condition: if $v_p(f''(a_0))=0$ (i.e., $f''(a_0)$ is a $p$-adic unit) and the quantity $d = -2f(a_0)/f''(a_0)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, then a solution exists. An element $d \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ if it can be written as $d = u \\cdot p^{2m}$ for some integer $m \\ge 0$ and $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$ is a $p$-adic unit whose reduction modulo $p$ is a quadratic residue. If this holds, standard Hensel's lemma guarantees that $y^2=d$ has a solution (in fact, two, $\\pm \\sqrt{d}$) in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. The lifts are then $x = a_0 \\pm \\sqrt{d}$. In general, this provides two distinct lifts, so uniqueness is not expected. This method applies to the problem at hand.\n\n2) Specialization to $p=7$ and $f(x)=x^2-98$.\n\nWe are given $p=7$ and $f(x)=x^2-98 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, which can be considered as a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Z}_7[x]$. We test the approximate solution $a_0=0$, which satisfies $a_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.\n- First, we verify the initial congruences.\n  $f(a_0) = f(0) = -98 = -2 \\cdot 7^2$. Since $f(0)$ is a multiple of $7$, we have $f(0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.\n- Next, we check the derivative. $f'(x)=2x$.\n  $f'(a_0) = f'(0) = 0$. Thus, $f'(0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.\nThe conditions of the problem are met. Since $f'(0)=0$, we are in Case B from Part 1. We compute the second derivative: $f''(x)=2$.\nSo, $f''(a_0)=f''(0)=2$. This is a $7$-adic unit, as $v_7(2)=0$.\nThe condition for lifting a root requires us to check if $d = -2f(0)/f''(0)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$.\n$$ d = \\frac{-2(-98)}{2} = 98 = 2 \\cdot 49 = 2 \\cdot 7^2 $$\nHere, in the form $u \\cdot p^{2m}$, we have $u=2$, $p=7$, and $m=1$. For $d$ to be a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, the unit part $u=2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_7^\\times$. This is true if and only if $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $7$. We check the squares modulo $7$: $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2=9 \\equiv 2$.\nSince $3^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$, $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $7$. Therefore, by the standard (non-singular) Hensel's lemma applied to $g(y)=y^2-2$, there exist two solutions for $y^2=2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. Let these solutions be denoted by $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe roots $x^*$ of $f(x)=0$ are then $x^* = a_0 \\pm \\sqrt{d} = 0 \\pm \\sqrt{98} = \\pm \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 7^2} = \\pm 7\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7$ be a solution to $y^2=2$. Then $x^*=7y$ is a solution to $f(x)=x^2-98=0$. This is the requested parametrization.\nThe two possible residue classes of $y$ modulo $7$ are the solutions to $y^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$. As computed above, these are $y \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7$ and $y \\equiv -3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$.\n\n3) Computation of $v_7\\big(f'(x^{\\ast})\\big)$.\n\nWe have found that any lifted root $x^*$ takes the form $x^*=7y$ for some $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7$ satisfying $y^2=2$.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)=2x$. At a lifted root $x^*$, its value is:\n$$ f'(x^*) = 2x^* = 2(7y) = 14y $$\nWe need to compute the $7$-adic valuation of this expression:\n$$ v_7\\big(f'(x^*)\\big) = v_7(14y) $$\nUsing the property $v_p(ab)=v_p(a)+v_p(b)$ of the valuation, we have:\n$$ v_7(14y) = v_7(14) + v_7(y) $$\nWe compute each term separately.\n- For $v_7(14)$: we write $14=2 \\cdot 7$. So, $v_7(14) = v_7(2) + v_7(7)$. Since $7$ is not a factor of $2$, $v_7(2)=0$. By definition, $v_7(7)=1$. Thus, $v_7(14)=0+1=1$.\n- For $v_7(y)$: $y$ is a solution to $y^2=2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. As we found in Part 2, the possible residue classes for $y$ modulo $7$ are $3$ and $4$. In either case, $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$, which means $y$ is not divisible by $7$. By definition, this means $y$ is a $7$-adic unit ($y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7^\\times$), and its valuation is $v_7(y)=0$.\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$ v_7\\big(f'(x^*)\\big) = 1 + 0 = 1 $$\nThis result holds for any of the lifted roots $x^*$ satisfying $x^* \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3015677"}, {"introduction": "This advanced problem [@problem_id:3015670] presents a case where finding a root is impossible within the field of $p$-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ for a fundamental structural reason.

All terms are standard and the premises are correct. We proceed to a full solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. We address them in sequence.\n\n**Part 1: Failure of Hensel's Lemma and Non-existence of Roots in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$**\n\nThe classical form of Hensel's lemma, also known as the simple root lifting lemma, states the following: Let $f(X) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}[X]$ be a polynomial with coefficients in the ring of $p$-adic integers. If there exists an element $\\overline{x}_{0}$ in the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ such that $\\overline{f}(\\overline{x}_{0}) = 0$ and the derivative $\\overline{f}'(\\overline{x}_{0}) \\neq 0$, then there exists a unique root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ of $f(X)$ such that $\\alpha \\equiv \\overline{x}_{0} \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the polynomial $f(X) = X^{2} - p^{3} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}[X]$. The prime $p$ is odd. The reduction of this polynomial modulo $p$ is obtained by reducing its coefficients modulo $p$. Since $p^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, the reduced polynomial is $\\overline{f}(x) = x^{2} - 0 = x^{2} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$.\n\nThe unique root of $\\overline{f}(x) = x^{2} = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is $\\overline{x}_{0} = 0$. This root has multiplicity $2$. To check the condition for Hensel's lemma, we must compute the derivative. The formal derivative of $f(X)$ is $f'(X) = 2X$. Its reduction modulo $p$ is $\\overline{f}'(x) = 2x$.\n\nWe evaluate the reduced derivative at the approximate root $\\overline{x}_{0} = 0$:\n$$\n\\overline{f}'(\\overline{x}_{0}) = \\overline{f}'(0) = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe condition $\\overline{f}'(\\overline{x}_{0}) \\neq 0$ is violated. The residue class $\\overline{x}_{0}=0$ is a singular point for the polynomial $f(X)$ because both the function and its derivative vanish upon reduction modulo $p$. Specifically, any putative lift of $\\overline{x}_{0}=0$ would be an element $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $\\alpha \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. Such an $\\alpha$ lies in the residue class $0 + p\\mathbb{Z}_p$, which is singular as $f(0) = -p^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ and $f'(0) = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. The multiplicity of the root $\\overline{x}_{0}=0$ for $\\overline{f}(x)$ is $2$, which is greater than $1$. Due to the vanishing derivative, the standard lifting criterion of Hensel's lemma fails, and its application is not justified.\n\nNext, we prove directly that there is no root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ for $f(X) = 0$. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that such a root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ exists. Then it must satisfy the equation $\\alpha^{2} = p^{3}$. We apply the $p$-adic valuation $v_{p}$ to both sides of this equation. The $p$-adic valuation has the property $v_{p}(a \\cdot b) = v_{p}(a) + v_{p}(b)$, which implies $v_{p}(x^{n}) = n \\cdot v_{p}(x)$ for any integer $n$.\n$$\nv_{p}(\\alpha^{2}) = v_{p}(p^{3})\n$$\n$$\n2 \\cdot v_{p}(\\alpha) = 3 \\cdot v_{p}(p)\n$$\nThe valuation is normalized such that $v_{p}(p) = 1$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n2 \\cdot v_{p}(\\alpha) = 3\n$$\nThis implies that $v_{p}(\\alpha) = 3/2$. However, the codomain (or value group) of the $p$-adic valuation $v_{p}$ on $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a fundamental property that $p$-adic valuations of elements in $\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times$ are integers. The value $3/2$ is not an integer. This is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, and there is no element $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ such that $f(\\alpha) = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Ramified Extension and Rescaling**\n\nWe now consider a finite extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with ramification index $e$. The valuation $v_{K}$ on $K$ has the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ as its value group and is related to $v_{p}$ by the formula $v_{K}(x) = e \\cdot v_{p}(x)$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. In particular, the valuation of $p$ in $K$ is $v_{K}(p) = e \\cdot v_{p}(p) = e \\cdot 1 = e$.\n\nSuppose there exists a root $\\alpha \\in K$ to the equation $f(X) = X^{2}-p^{3}=0$. Then $\\alpha^{2}=p^{3}$. We apply the valuation $v_{K}$ to this equation:\n$$\nv_{K}(\\alpha^{2}) = v_{K}(p^{3})\n$$\n$$\n2 \\cdot v_{K}(\\alpha) = 3 \\cdot v_{K}(p)\n$$\nSubstituting $v_{K}(p) = e$:\n$$\n2 \\cdot v_{K}(\\alpha) = 3e\n$$\nThus, $v_{K}(\\alpha) = 3e/2$. Since $\\alpha$ is an element of the field $K$, its valuation $v_{K}(\\alpha)$ must be an integer (unless $\\alpha=0$, which is not a root). For $3e/2$ to be an integer, it is necessary that $2$ divides $3e$. Since $\\gcd(2, 3) = 1$, this implies that $2$ must divide $e$. The ramification index $e$ must be an even integer. The minimal positive integer value for $e$ that satisfies this condition is $e=2$.\n\nTo show that $e=2$ is sufficient, we must demonstrate the existence of an extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with ramification index $2$ that contains a root of $X^{2}-p^{3}=0$.\nConsider the field extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\\sqrt{p})$. This is a quadratic extension. An element $\\pi = \\sqrt{p}$ is in $K$. Squaring it gives $\\pi^{2} = p$. Let us define a valuation $v_{K}$ on $K$ normalized such that $v_{K}(\\pi)=1$. Then $v_{K}(p) = v_{K}(\\pi^{2}) = 2v_{K}(\\pi) = 2$. By definition, the ramification index of this extension is $e=2$.\nNow we check if a root exists in $K$. We seek an $\\alpha \\in K$ such that $\\alpha^{2}=p^{3}$. Let us test the element $\\alpha = p\\sqrt{p} = p\\pi$. This element is in $K$.\n$$\n\\alpha^{2} = (p\\pi)^{2} = p^{2}\\pi^{2} = p^{2}p = p^{3}\n$$\nThus, $\\alpha=p\\sqrt{p}$ is a root of $f(X)=0$ in $K$. This confirms that an extension with ramification index $e=2$ is sufficient. Therefore, the minimal required ramification index is $e=2$.\n\nFinally, we explain the rescaling process. In the extension $K=\\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\\sqrt{p})$ with uniformizer $\\pi=\\sqrt{p}$, our analysis showed that a root $\\alpha$ must have valuation $v_{K}(\\alpha) = 3e/2 = 3(2)/2 = 3$. This means $\\alpha$ can be written as $\\alpha = u \\cdot \\pi^{3}$ for some unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}^{\\times}$, where $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is the ring of integers of $K$. This suggests a change of variables to isolate the unit part.\nLet $X = \\pi^{3}Y$. Substitute this into the original polynomial equation $X^{2}-p^{3}=0$:\n$$\n(\\pi^{3}Y)^{2} - p^{3} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\pi^{2}=p$, we have $p^{3} = (\\pi^{2})^{3} = \\pi^{6}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\pi^{6}Y^{2} - \\pi^{6} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\pi \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $\\pi^{6}$ to obtain a new polynomial equation for $Y$:\n$$\ng(Y) = Y^{2} - 1 = 0\n$$\nWe can solve this for $Y$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ using Hensel's lemma. The maximal ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $\\mathfrak{m}_{K}=(\\pi)$. The residue field is $\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{m}_{K} \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{p}$. The reduction of $g(Y)$ modulo $\\pi$ is $\\overline{g}(y) = y^{2}-1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}[y]$.\nThe roots of $\\overline{g}(y)=0$ are $\\overline{y}_{0}=1$ and $\\overline{y}_{0}=-1$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $1 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod p$, so these are distinct roots. Let's choose $\\overline{y}_{0}=1$.\nThe derivative is $g'(Y)=2Y$, which reduces to $\\overline{g}'(y)=2y$. At our chosen root, $\\overline{g}'(1) = 2 \\neq 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ because $p$ is odd.\nThe conditions for the simple root version of Hensel's lemma are satisfied for $g(Y)$ and the approximate root $\\overline{y}_{0}=1$. Therefore, there exists a unique root $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that $g(\\beta)=0$ (i.e., $\\beta^2=1$) and $\\beta \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\pi}$.\nOnce we have this root $\\beta$, we can recover the root of the original polynomial as $\\alpha = \\pi^{3}\\beta$. This variable transformation $X = \\pi^3 Y$ is the \"suitable rescaling\" that transforms the original problem with a singular reduced root into a new problem with a simple reduced root, where Hensel's lemma can be successfully applied.\nThe minimal ramification index required for this procedure is $e=2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3015670"}]}
