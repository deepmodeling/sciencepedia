The valuation $v_{p}(n)$ of an integer $n$ is defined as the exponent of the highest power of the prime $p$ that divides $n$. For a rational number $x = \\frac{m}{n}$, the valuation is defined as $v_{p}(x) = v_{p}(m) - v_{p}(n)$. This definition is consistent with the given property $v_{p}(a/b)=v_{p}(a)-v_{p}(b)$.\n\nWe find the $7$-adic valuation of $a$ and $b$. By inspecting the prime factorization of $a$, we see that the exponent of the prime $p=7$ is $3$. All other prime factors ($2$, $11$, $13$) are not equal to $7$. Therefore, the $7$-adic valuation of $a$ is:\n$$\nv_{7}(a) = v_{7}(2^{10} \\cdot 7^{3} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13) = 3\n$$\nSimilarly, by inspecting the prime factorization of $b$, we find the exponent of the prime $p=7$ is $5$. The other prime factors ($3$, $5$) are not equal to $7$. Therefore, the $7$-adic valuation of $b$ is:\n$$\nv_{7}(b) = v_{7}(3^{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^{5}) = 5\n$$\nUsing the property $v_{p}(x/y) = v_{p}(x) - v_{p}(y)$, we compute the valuation of the fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$:\n$$\nv_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = v_{7}(a) - v_{7}(b) = 3 - 5 = -2\n$$\nNext, we compute the $7$-adic absolute value. The definition provided is $|x|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(x)}$. For our case, $p=7$ and $x = \\frac{a}{b}$. We use the valuation we just calculated:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right|_{7} = 7^{-v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)} = 7^{-(-2)} = 7^{2} = 49\n$$\nNow, we interpret these results.\n\nIn terms of divisibility, the $p$-adic valuation measures how many factors of $p$ are present in a number.\n- $v_{7}(a) = 3$ signifies that $a$ is divisible by $7^3$ but not by $7^4$.\n- $v_{7}(b) = 5$ signifies that $b$ is divisible by $7^5$ but not by $7^6$.\n- When we form the quotient $\\frac{a}{b}$, the factors of $7$ cancel.\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2^{10} \\cdot 7^{3} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13}{3^{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^{5}} = \\frac{2^{10} \\cdot 11^{2} \\cdot 13}{3^{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^{2}}\n$$\nThe result $v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = -2$ reflects that, after simplification, the denominator of the fraction contains a factor of $7^2$. A negative valuation indicates that the number is \"divisible by $p^{-1}$\", meaning $p$ is in its denominator.\n\nIn terms of the decomposition of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\\times}$, there is a canonical isomorphism $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\\times} \\cong p^{\\mathbb{Z}} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\\times}$. Any non-zero $p$-adic number $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\\times}$ can be uniquely written as $x = p^{n}u$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is an integer and $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\\times}$ is a $p$-adic unit. A $p$-adic unit is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ with a multiplicative inverse, which is equivalent to the condition $|u|_{p}=1$, or $v_{p}(u)=0$. The integer $n$ in this decomposition is precisely the $p$-adic valuation of $x$, so $n=v_{p}(x)$.\n\nFor our problem, $x = \\frac{a}{b}$ and $p=7$. We calculated $v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = -2$. Therefore, the exponent $n$ in the decomposition is $n = -2$. The number $\\frac{a}{b}$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b} = 7^{-2} \\cdot u\n$$\nwhere $u$ is a $7$-adic unit.

The result $v_{7}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = -2$ identifies the discrete part of the number in the decomposition of $\\mathbb{Q}_{7}^{\\times}$. The absolute value $|\\frac{a}{b}|_{7} = 49$ measures the \"size\" of the number in the $7$-adic metric, which is determined entirely by this discrete valuation part, since $|x|_{p} = |p^{n}u|_{p} = |p^{n}|_{p} |u|_{p} = p^{-n} \\cdot 1 = p^{-v_{p}(x)}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 49 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3028374"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ to the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, we encounter a deeper structural feature: the Teichmüller representatives.

We will proceed by first defining the Teichmüller section and its image, then proving existence and uniqueness from first principles, and finally computing the specific value requested.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Teichmüller Representative Set and Section\n\nLet $p$ be an odd prime. The ring of $p$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is the inverse limit $\\varprojlim_n \\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$.

The problem requires a multiplicative section, which means a map $\\omega: \\mathbb{F}_p \\to \\mathbb{Z}_p$ that is a homomorphism of multiplicative monoids.

It is a lift of $a$: $\\mathrm{red}(\\omega(a)) = a$.\n2.  It satisfies the equation $x^p = x$.\n\nFor $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}^{\\times}$, this second condition is equivalent to $\\omega(a)^{p-1}=1$, since $\\omega(a)$ must be a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. For $a=0$, the only solution to $x^p=x$ that reduces to $0$ is $x=0$. Thus, $\\omega(0)=0$. For $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}^{\\times}$, $\\omega(a)$ is a $(p-1)$-th root of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.\n\nThe **Teichmüller representative set** $\\mathcal{T}$ is the image of this map $\\omega$:\n$$ \\mathcal{T} = \\mathrm{Im}(\\omega) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p} \\mid x^p = x \\} $$\nThis set consists of $0$ and the group of $(p-1)$-th roots of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.

The map $\\omega|_{\\mathbb{F}_{p}^{\\times}}$ is a group isomorphism from $\\mathbb{F}_{p}^{\\times}$ to the group of $(p-1)$-th roots of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.\n\n### Step 2: Justification of Existence and Uniqueness\n\nWe must show that for each $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}$, there exists a unique $\\omega(a) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ with the properties specified above.\n\n**Uniqueness and Existence via Hensel's Lemma:**\nConsider the polynomial $f(X) = X^p - X \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}[X]$.

That is, $f(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ for all $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\nThe derivative is $f'(X) = pX^{p-1} - 1$. For any $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}$, let $a_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ be an integer such that $a_0 \\pmod p = a$. Then, evaluating the derivative modulo $p$:\n$$ f'(a_0) \\equiv p a_0^{p-1} - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $$\nSince $f'(a_0) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, its $p$-adic absolute value is $|f'(a_0)|_p = 1$.\nAccording to Hensel's Lemma, for each simple root $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}$ of $f(X) \\pmod{p}$, there exists a unique root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ of $f(X)$ such that $\\alpha \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$.\nSince all $p$ roots of $X^p-X$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ are distinct (because its derivative is nowhere zero), each $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}$ lifts to a unique root $\\omega(a) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ of $X^p-X=0$. This establishes both the existence and uniqueness of the Teichmüller representative for every element of $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\n\n**Constructive Proof of Existence:**\nThis uniqueness allows for an explicit construction. Let $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}$ and choose any integer lift $a_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a_0 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$. For instance, we can choose $a_0 \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$. Consider the sequence $\\{x_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ defined by:\n$$ x_n = a_0^{p^n} $$\nWe show this sequence is a Cauchy sequence in the $p$-adic metric.\nFor $n \\ge m$, $x_n - x_m = a_0^{p^n} - a_0^{p^m}$. It suffices to check $|x_{n+1} - x_n|_p \\to 0$.\n$$ x_{n+1} - x_n = a_0^{p^{n+1}} - a_0^{p^n} = a_0^{p^n} \\left( a_0^{p^{n+1}-p^n} - 1 \\right) = a_0^{p^n} \\left( a_0^{p^n(p-1)} - 1 \\right) $$\nIf $a=0$, then $a_0=0$ and the sequence is constant at $0$. If $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}^{\\times}$, then $p \\nmid a_0$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $a_0^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Let $a_0^{p-1} = 1 + kp$ for some integer $k$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, we can use the lifting-the-exponent lemma or binomial expansion. For $n \\ge 0$,\n$$ (a_0^{p-1})^{p^n} = (1+kp)^{p^n} = 1 + p^n(kp) + \\binom{p^n}{2}(kp)^2 + \\dots $$\nThe $p$-adic valuation of the second term is $v_p(p^{n+1}k) = n+1+v_p(k) \\ge n+1$. All subsequent terms have higher $p$-adic valuations. Thus, $v_p((a_0^{p-1})^{p^n} - 1) \\ge n+1$. This implies $a_0^{p^n(p-1)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^{n+1}}$.\nThe $p$-adic valuation of the difference is:\n$$ v_p(x_{n+1} - x_n) = v_p(a_0^{p^n}) + v_p(a_0^{p^n(p-1)} - 1) = 0 + v_p(a_0^{p^n(p-1)} - 1) \\ge n+1 $$\nThus, $|x_{n+1}-x_n|_p \\le p^{-(n+1)}$. The sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in the complete metric space $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and therefore converges to a limit, which we define as $\\omega(a)$.\n\nThis limit has the required properties:\n1.  **Reduction modulo $p$**: For any $n \\ge 0$, $x_n = a_0^{p^n} \\equiv (a_0^p)^... \\equiv a_0 \\pmod{p}$ by repeated application of Fermat's Little Theorem. Thus, the limit must also satisfy $\\omega(a) \\equiv a_0 \\pmod p$, i.e., $\\mathrm{red}(\\omega(a)) = a$.\n2.  **Root property**: Taking the limit of the relation $x_{n+1} = x_n^p$, we get:\n    $$ \\omega(a) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_{n+1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n^p = \\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n\\right)^p = (\\omega(a))^p $$\nSo, $\\omega(a)$ is a root of $X^p-X=0$. By the uniqueness argument from Hensel's Lemma, this construction yields the unique Teichmüller lift.\n\nThis construction gives an explicit analytic formula for the Teichmüller representative:\n$$ \\omega(a) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_0^{p^n} $$\nwhere $a_0$ is any integer with $a_0 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$. The limit is taken in the $p$-adic topology.\n\n### Step 3: Computation for $p=5$ and $a=2$\n\nWe are asked to compute the Teichmüller lift $\\omega(2)$ for $p=5$ and $a=2 \\in \\mathbb{F}_5^{\\times}$. Following the constructive method above, we can choose the integer lift $a_0 = 2$.\nThe Teichmüller representative $\\omega(2)$ is given by the limit in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$:\n$$ \\omega(2) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 2^{5^n} $$\nThis expression is a single closed-form analytic expression that uniquely defines the element $\\omega(2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$. The problem asks for such an expression, and this limit formula is the standard and most direct representation. It defines $\\omega(2)$ as the limit of a Cauchy sequence of integers $2, 2^5, 2^{25}, 2^{125}, \\dots$ in the $5$-adic topology.

Since $v_3(a_1) \\ge 1$ and $v_3(a_0) \\ge 1$, this condition is satisfied.\n3.  The constant term $a_0$ must not be divisible by $3^2=9$. We have $v_3(a_0)=1$, so $a_0$ is not divisible by $9$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nSince all three conditions of the Eisenstein criterion are met for $p=3$, the polynomial $f(x)=x^2-3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_3$.\n\nLet $\\alpha \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_3$ be a root of $f(x)$. The field extension $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)/\\mathbb{Q}_3$ has degree equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$, which is $2$.\nA standard theorem in algebraic number theory states that an extension generated by a root of an Eisenstein polynomial is totally ramified. Since $f(x)$ is an Eisenstein polynomial of degree $2$, the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)/\\mathbb{Q}_3$ is a totally ramified quadratic extension. The ramification index is $e=2$ and the residue field degree is $f=1$.\n\nTo compute $|\\alpha|_3$, we use the defining relation $f(\\alpha)=0$, which is $\\alpha^2 - 3 = 0$, or $\\alpha^2=3$. We take the $3$-adic absolute value of both sides:\n$$|\\alpha^2|_3 = |3|_3$$\nUsing the property $|x^n|_p = |x|_p^n$ and the normalization $|3|_3 = 3^{-1}$, we get:\n$$|\\alpha|_3^2 = 3^{-1}$$\nTaking the square root of this real-valued equation, we find:\n$$|\\alpha|_3 = (3^{-1})^{1/2} = 3^{-1/2}$$\nIn terms of valuations, this corresponds to $v_3(\\alpha) = 1/2$.

The polynomial $f(x)=x^2-3$ has degree $2$, so $\\alpha$ has exactly one other conjugate. Since $f(x)$ has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}_3$, if $\\alpha$ is a root, then so is $-\\alpha$, because $(-\\alpha)^2 - 3 = \\alpha^2 - 3 = 0$. As $\\alpha^2=3 \\neq 0$, we have $\\alpha \\neq 0$, so $\\alpha \\neq -\\alpha$.

This refers to Krasner's Lemma, which states:\n*If $\\alpha \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $\\beta \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ satisfies $|\\beta-\\alpha|_p < \\delta(\\alpha)$, then $\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_p(\\beta)$.*\n\nIn our case, with $p=3$, we have found that $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = \\delta(\\alpha)$. The strict inequality required by Krasner's Lemma is not satisfied. Therefore, the conclusion of the lemma, $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$, is not guaranteed.\n\nWe can check the extensions directly to see that they differ.\n-   The extension generated by $\\beta$ is $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta) = \\mathbb{Q}_3(0) = \\mathbb{Q}_3$. This is the base field itself, a degree $1$ extension.\n-   The extension generated by $\\alpha$ is $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$, which, as established in Part 1, is a degree $2$ extension over $\\mathbb{Q}_3$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha)$ is a proper extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_3$, it is manifest that $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$ and, in particular, $\\mathbb{Q}_3(\\alpha) \\not\\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}_3(\\beta)$. This situation demonstrates that the strict inequality in Krasner's Lemma is a crucial condition. When the distance from $\\beta$ to $\\alpha$ is exactly the minimal distance from $\\alpha$ to its conjugates, it is possible for the conclusion of the lemma to fail, as it does in this case.\n\nThe final answer is the value of $|\\beta-\\alpha|_3$.\n$$|\\beta-\\alpha|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3^{-1/2}}$$", "id": "3020585"}]}
