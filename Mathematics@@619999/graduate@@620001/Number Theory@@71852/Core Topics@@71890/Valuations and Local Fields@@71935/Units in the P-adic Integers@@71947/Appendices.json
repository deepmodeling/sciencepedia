This first practice invites you to calculate the inverse of a simple unit, $3$, within the $2$-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. By constructing the inverse through a sequence of modular congruences and by summing a geometric series, you will gain a hands-on understanding of convergence in the $p$-adic metric and the practical meaning of a multiplicative inverse in this non-Archimedean world. [@problem_id:3030869]", "problem": "Let $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ denote the field of $2$-adic numbers and let $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ denote the ring of $2$-adic integers. The $2$-adic valuation $v_2$ on $\\mathbb{Q}$ is defined by the rule $v_2(0) = +\\infty$, and for a nonzero rational number $x$, the integer $v_2(x)$ is the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $x$. The $2$-adic absolute value is defined by $|x|_2 = 2^{-v_2(x)}$, and the $2$-adic metric is $d_2(x,y) = |x-y|_2$. The ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the closure of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with respect to $d_2$, equivalently the inverse limit of the system $\\mathbb{Z}/2^n\\mathbb{Z}$. An element $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is called a unit if there exists $u^{-1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ with $uu^{-1} = 1$.\n\nUsing only these foundational definitions and properties, perform the following tasks. First, show that $1+2$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and compute $(1+2)^{-1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ to high precision by constructing a compatible sequence of residues modulo $2^n$ and identifying the limiting $2$-adic integer. Your construction should make clear how to recover the value to at least precision modulo $2^{20}$. Second, establish from first principles that the geometric series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-2)^n$ converges in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ and determine its sum by an argument that relies on the metric properties of $|\\cdot|_2$ and completeness. Finally, explain why the element computed as $(1+2)^{-1}$ coincides with the sum of the series.\n\nReport the common value as a single exact expression. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for several related tasks concerning the element $3 = 1+2$ in the ring of $2$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We must first show it is a unit and compute its inverse, then analyze the convergence of a related geometric series, and finally show that both computations yield the same value, which is to be reported.\n\nFirst, we address the status of $u = 1+2 = 3$ as a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. An element $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a unit if and only if it has a multiplicative inverse in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. A standard criterion for this is that its $2$-adic absolute value must be $1$. The ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ consists of all elements $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$ such that $|x|_2 \\le 1$. An element $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a unit if and only if $|u|_2 = 1$. The $2$-adic valuation of $3$, an integer, is the exponent of $2$ in its prime factorization. Since $3 = 2^0 \\cdot 3^1$, the exponent of $2$ is $0$. Thus, $v_2(3) = 0$. The $2$-adic absolute value is then $|3|_2 = 2^{-v_2(3)} = 2^{-0} = 1$. Since $|3|_2=1$, $3$ is indeed a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nTo compute the inverse $x = 3^{-1}$, we seek an element $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ such that $3x=1$. Representing $x$ as an element of the inverse limit $\\varprojlim \\mathbb{Z}/2^n\\mathbb{Z}$, we need to find a compatible sequence of residues $(x_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ where $x_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2^n\\mathbb{Z}$, $x_{n+1} \\equiv x_n \\pmod{2^n}$, and $3x_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1$: $3x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, which simplifies to $x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Thus, we take $x_1=1$.\nFor $n=2$: $3x_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Since $x_2 \\equiv x_1 \\pmod{2}$, we can write $x_2 = 1 + 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the congruence gives $3(1+2k) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, which is $3+6k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, or $3+2k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This implies $2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, so $k$ must be odd. We choose $k=1$, which gives $x_2 = 1+2(1)=3$.\nFor $n=3$: $3x_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. We write $x_3 = 3 + 4k$. Substituting yields $3(3+4k) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, which is $9+12k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, or $1+4k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. This implies $4k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, so $k$ must be even. We choose $k=0$, yielding $x_3=3$.\nFor $n=4$: $3x_4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. We write $x_4 = 3 + 8k$. Substituting yields $3(3+8k) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, which is $9+24k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, or $9+8k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. This implies $8k \\equiv -8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{16}$, so $k$ must be odd. We choose $k=1$, yielding $x_4=3+8=11$.\nFor $n=5$: $3x_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$. We write $x_5 = 11 + 16k$. Substituting yields $3(11+16k) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$, which is $33+48k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$, or $1+16k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$. This implies $16k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$, so $k$ must be even. We choose $k=0$, yielding $x_5=11$.\nThis iterative process, known as Hensel's lifting, can be continued to any desired precision $n$. For example, it could be used to find $x_{20}$. The resulting sequence $(1, 3, 3, 11, 11, \\dots)$ defines the $2$-adic integer $3^{-1}$. The canonical $2$-adic expansion $x = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k 2^k$ with $a_k \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is obtained from this sequence. The coefficient $a_k$ is determined by the value of $(x_{k+1} - x_k)/2^k$. From our calculations:\n$a_0 = x_1 = 1$.\n$a_1 = (x_2-x_1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1$.\n$a_2 = (x_3-x_2)/4 = (3-3)/4=0$.\n$a_3 = (x_4-x_3)/8 = (11-3)/8=1$.\n$a_4 = (x_5-x_4)/16 = (11-11)/16=0$.\nThe pattern of the coefficients is $a_0=1$, and for $k \\ge 1$, $a_k = 1$ if $k$ is odd and $a_k = 0$ if $k$ is even. This corresponds to the $2$-adic integer whose expansion is $...0101011_2$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the geometric series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-2)^n$. This is a geometric series with ratio $r = -2$. In a $p$-adic field, a geometric series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty r^n$ converges if and only if $|r|_p  1$. In our case, $p=2$. We compute the $2$-adic absolute value of the ratio $r=-2$. The valuation is $v_2(-2) = v_2(-1 \\cdot 2^1) = v_2(-1) + v_2(2) = 0+1=1$. Therefore, the absolute value is $|-2|_2 = 2^{-v_2(-2)} = 2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $|-2|_2 = \\frac{1}{2}  1$, the condition for convergence is met. The series converges in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The sum of a convergent geometric series is given by the standard formula $S = \\frac{1}{1-r}$. Substituting $r=-2$, we find the sum to be $S = \\frac{1}{1 - (-2)} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFinally, we explain why the results of the two parts are identical. The first part computes the multiplicative inverse of $3$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is by definition the element $1/3$ in the field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The second part computes the sum of a convergent series, which evaluates to the rational number $1/3$. Thus, both procedures identify the same element of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nTo be more explicit, let $x = 3^{-1}$ be the element found in the first part, and $S = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-2)^n$ be the sum from the second part. We want to show $x=S$. The partial sums of the series are $S_N = \\sum_{n=0}^N (-2)^n = \\frac{1 - (-2)^{N+1}}{1 - (-2)} = \\frac{1 - (-2)^{N+1}}{3}$. As $N \\to \\infty$ in the real sense, the sequence of $2$-adic numbers $S_N$ converges to $S$ in the $2$-adic metric. This is because $|S - S_N|_2 = |\\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty (-2)^n|_2 = |(-2)^{N+1} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-2)^k|_2 = |(-2)^{N+1}|_2 |S|_2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^{N+1} |1/3|_2$, which tends to $0$.\nThe element $x$ from the first part is defined by the property $3x=1$. The sum $S$ satisfies $3S = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 1$. Since the inverse of $3$ in the field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is unique, it must be that $x=S$.\nThe connection between the compatible sequence $(x_n)$ and the partial sums $(S_N)$ is that for any fixed $n \\ge 1$, if we take $N \\ge n-1$, then $v_2((-2)^{N+1}) = N+1 \\ge n$. This means $(-2)^{N+1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2^n}$.\nFrom the formula for $S_N$, we have $3S_N = 1 - (-2)^{N+1}$. Modulo $2^n$, this becomes $3S_N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}$. This shows that for $N$ large enough, $S_N \\pmod{2^n}$ is precisely the residue $x_n$ we computed in the first part. Therefore, the sequence of partial sums $(S_N)$ and the compatible sequence $(x_n)$ define the same $2$-adic integer.\n\nThe common value is the rational number $1/3$. Its explicit $2$-adic expansion is given by the pattern of coefficients we found: $x = 1 + \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 2^{2k+1} = 1+2(1+4+16+...) = 1+2\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}4^j$. Since $|4|_2 = 1/4  1$, the inner series converges to $\\frac{1}{1-4} = -\\frac{1}{3}$. So $x = 1+2(-\\frac{1}{3}) = 1-\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$. The common value is best expressed as the rational number itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "3030869"}, {"introduction": "Beyond computing with individual elements, a central goal is to understand the algebraic structure of objects like the group of $p$-adic units.
