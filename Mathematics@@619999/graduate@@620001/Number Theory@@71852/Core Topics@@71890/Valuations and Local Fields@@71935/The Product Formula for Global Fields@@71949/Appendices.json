The product is defined as $P(x) = \\prod_{v}\\,|x|_v^{\\,n_v}$, where the product is taken over all places $v$ of $K$. The factors $|x|_v$ are the normalized absolute values at each place $v$, and $n_v$ are the corresponding local degrees. A factor in the product is different from $1$ only if $|x|_v \\neq 1$. We must identify these places and compute the corresponding terms.\n\nThe places $v$ of $K$ where $|x|_v$ can be different from $1$ are of two types:\n$1$. Non-archimedean places corresponding to prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ that appear in the prime factorization of the principal ideal $(x)$.\n$2$. Archimedean places.\n\nWe will analyze these two cases for $x=2+i \\in K^{\\times}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the non-archimedean places. We need to find the prime ideal factorization of the principal ideal $(x)=(2+i)$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The norm of the element $x=2+i$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(x) = (2+i)(2-i) = 2^2+1^2=5$. The norm of the principal ideal $(x)$ is $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(x)| = 5$. Since the norm of the ideal is the prime number $5$, the ideal $(2+i)$ must itself be a prime ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Let us denote this prime ideal by $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (2+i)$. The prime factorization of the ideal $(x)$ is therefore simply $(x) = \\mathfrak{p}_1^1$.\nFor any non-archimedean place $v$ associated with a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$, the absolute value is given by $|x|_v = N(\\mathfrak{p})^{-\\mathrm{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}}(x)}$.\nIf $\\mathfrak{p} = \\mathfrak{p}_1$, then $\\mathrm{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_1}(x)=1$, so $|x|_{v_{\\mathfrak{p}_1}} \\neq 1$.\nIf $\\mathfrak{p}$ is any other prime ideal, $\\mathfrak{p} \\neq \\mathfrak{p}_1$, then $\\mathrm{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}}(x)=0$, which implies $|x|_{v_{\\mathfrak{p}}} = N(\\mathfrak{p})^0 = 1$.\nTherefore, the only non-archimedean place that contributes a non-unit factor to the product is the place $v_1$ corresponding to the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (2+i)$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the archimedean places. The number field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ has degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$. It is an imaginary quadratic field, so it has no embeddings into $\\mathbb{R}$. It has two complex embeddings:\n$\\sigma_1: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$, defined by $\\sigma_1(a+bi) = a+bi$ (the identity).\n$\\sigma_2: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$, defined by $\\sigma_2(a+bi) = a-bi$ (complex conjugation).\nSince $\\sigma_2 = \\overline{\\sigma_1}$, this pair of conjugate embeddings corresponds to a single complex archimedean place of $K$, which we denote by $v_\\infty$.\nAccording to the problem's definition, the absolute value at this place is $|x|_{v_\\infty} = |\\sigma_1(x)| = |2+i| = \\sqrt{2^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{5}$. (Using $\\sigma_2$ would yield the same result: $|\\sigma_2(x)| = |2-i| = \\sqrt{5}$.) Since $\\sqrt{5} \\neq 1$, the archimedean place $v_\\infty$ also contributes a non-unit factor to the product.\n\nIn summary, the only places $v$ for which $|x|_v \\neq 1$ are the non-archimedean place $v_1$ corresponding to $\\mathfrak{p}_1=(2+i)$ and the archimedean place $v_\\infty$.\n\nNow, we compute the weights $n_v = [K_v : \\mathbb{Q}_v]$ and the values $|x|_v$ for these two places.\n\nFor the non-archimedean place $v_1$ associated with $\\mathfrak{p}_1=(2+i)$:\nThe prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_1$ lies over the rational prime $p$ which is the characteristic of the residue field $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_1$. The norm of $\\mathfrak{p}_1$ is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_1) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2+i) = 5$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{p}_1$ lies over the prime $p=5$.\nTo find the weight $n_{v_1}$, we examine the decomposition of the ideal $(5)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the prime $5$ splits in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The factorization is $(5) = (2+i)(2-i) = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$, where $\\mathfrak{p}_2=(2-i)$.\nThe local degree $n_{v_1} = [K_{v_1}:\\mathbb{Q}_5]$ is given by the product of the ramification index $e(\\mathfrak{p}_1|5)$ and the inertial degree $f(\\mathfrak{p}_1|5)$. From the factorization $(5)=\\mathfrak{p}_1^1 \\mathfrak{p}_2^1$, we have $e(\\mathfrak{p}_1|5)=1$. The inertial degree is given by $N(\\mathfrak{p}_1) = 5^{f(\\mathfrak{p}_1|5)}$. Since $N(\\mathfrak{p}_1)=5$, we have $f(\\mathfrak{p}_1|5)=1$.\nTherefore, the weight is $n_{v_1} = e(\\mathfrak{p}_1|5)f(\\mathfrak{p}_1|5) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThe absolute value at $v_1$ is $|x|_{v_1} = N(\\mathfrak{p}_1)^{-\\mathrm{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_1}(x)} = 5^{-1} = \\frac{1}{5}$, since $\\mathrm{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_1}(x)=1$.\n\nFor the archimedean place $v_\\infty$:\nThis is a complex place, so the completion $K_{v_\\infty}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}$. The induced place on $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the usual archimedean one, so the completion $\\mathbb{Q}_{v_\\infty}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe weight is the degree of the field extension of the completions: $n_{v_\\infty} = [K_{v_\\infty}:\\mathbb{Q}_{v_\\infty}] = [\\mathbb{C} : \\mathbb{R}] = 2$.\nThe absolute value at $v_\\infty$ is $|x|_{v_\\infty} = |\\sigma_1(x)| = |2+i| = \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the product $P(x) = \\prod_{v}\\,|x|_v^{\\,n_v}$.\nThe product consists of factors for all places $v$ of $K$. For any place $v$ other than $v_1$ and $v_\\infty$, we have $|x|_v=1$, so $|x|_v^{n_v}=1$. The product simplifies to the contributions from just these two places:\n$$\nP(x) = |x|_{v_1}^{\\,n_{v_1}} \\cdot |x|_{v_\\infty}^{\\,n_{v_\\infty}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we computed:\n$$\nP(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^1 \\cdot \\left(\\sqrt{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 5 = 1\n$$\nThis result is an instance of the general product formula for global fields, which states that for any nonzero element $y$ in a number field $F$, the product $\\prod_{v} |y|_v^{n_v}$ over all places $v$ of $F$ is equal to $1$.
