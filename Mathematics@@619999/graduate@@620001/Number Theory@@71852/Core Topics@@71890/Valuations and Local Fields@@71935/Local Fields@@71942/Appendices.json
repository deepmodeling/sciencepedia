I will proceed with the solution.\n\n***\n\n### Part 1: Newton Polygon and Valuations of the Roots\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x)=x^{3}-2x+5$. Let us write it as $f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$, where $a_3=1$, $a_2=0$, $a_1=-2$, and $a_0=5$.\n\nTo construct the Newton polygon with respect to the $5$-adic valuation $v_5$, we plot the points $(i, v_5(a_i))$ for all non-zero coefficients $a_i$.\nThe valuations of the coefficients are:\n- $v_5(a_3) = v_5(1) = 0$.\n- $v_5(a_1) = v_5(-2) = 0$, since $5$ does not divide $-2$.\n- $v_5(a_0) = v_5(5) = 1$.\n\nThe points to be plotted in the Cartesian plane are $P_3=(3, v_5(a_3))=(3,0)$, $P_1=(1, v_5(a_1))=(1,0)$, and $P_0=(0, v_5(a_0))=(0,1)$.\n\nThe Newton polygon is the lower convex hull of this set of points.\n1. The first segment connects the rightmost point $P_3=(3,0)$ to $P_1=(1,0)$. The slope of this segment is $m_1 = \\frac{0-0}{1-3} = 0$. The length of its horizontal projection is $l_1 = 3-1=2$.\n2. The second segment connects $P_1=(1,0)$ to $P_0=(0,1)$. The slope of this segment is $m_2 = \\frac{1-0}{0-1} = -1$. The length of its horizontal projection is $l_2 = 1-0=1$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental properties of Newton polygons, for each segment with slope $-m$ and horizontal length $l$, there are exactly $l$ roots (counted with multiplicity) in an algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{Q}_5$ having valuation $m$.\n- For the first segment ($m_1=0$, $l_1=2$), there are $2$ roots with valuation $-m_1 = -0 = 0$.\n- For the second segment ($m_2=-1$, $l_2=1$), there is $1$ root with valuation $-m_2 = -(-1) = 1$.\n\nThus, the multiset of the $5$-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ is $\\{0, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n### Part 2: Identification of the Unique Root in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$\n\nWe are looking for a root $r \\in \\mathbb{Q}_5$ that reduces to a simple root modulo $5$. First, we reduce the polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $5$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) \\equiv x^3 - 2x + 5 \\pmod{5}$\n$\\bar{f}(x) \\equiv x^3 - 2x \\pmod{5}$\n$\\bar{f}(x) \\equiv x(x^2 - 2) \\pmod{5}$\n\nThe roots of $\\bar{f}(x)$ in the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_5 = \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$ are the solutions to $x(x^2 - 2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. One root is clearly $\\bar{a}_0=0$. For other roots, we would need to solve $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. The quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 4$. Since $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $5$, the equation $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ has no solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_5$. Therefore, $\\bar{a}_0=0$ is the only root of $\\bar{f}(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n\nTo check if this root is simple, we compute the derivative of $f(x)$ and reduce it modulo $5$:\n$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2$\n$\\bar{f}'(x) = 3x^2 - 2 \\pmod{5}$\nEvaluating at the root $\\bar{a}_0=0$:\n$\\bar{f}'(0) = 3(0)^2 - 2 = -2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nSince $\\bar{f}'(0) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, the root $\\bar{a}_0=0$ is a simple root. By Hensel's Lemma, there exists a unique root $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$ (and thus in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$) such that $r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and $f(r)=0$. The condition $r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ is equivalent to $v_5(r) \\ge 1$.\n\nFrom the Newton polygon analysis, the valuations of the roots are $\\{0, 0, 1\\}$. For our root $r$, we must have $v_5(r) \\in \\{0, 0, 1\\}$. Since we know $v_5(r) \\ge 1$, it must be that $v_5(r)=1$. This root is unique in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$, as the other two roots have valuation $0$ and correspond to the irreducible factor $x^2-2$ over $\\mathbb{F}_5$, implying they lie in an unramified quadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_5$.\n\n### Part 3: 5-adic Expansion of the Root $r$\n\nWe will find the expansion $r = c_1 5 + c_2 5^2 + c_3 5^3 + c_4 5^4 + \\dots$, where $c_i \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, using the iterative lifting process based on Hensel's Lemma (equivalent to Newton's method). An approximation $r_k$ is refined to $r_{k+1}$ by finding a coefficient $c_k$ in $r_k = r_{k-1} + c_k 5^k$. This is done by solving $f(r_k) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^{k+1}}$ using the Taylor expansion $f(r_{k-1} + c_k 5^k) \\approx f(r_{k-1}) + f'(r_{k-1}) c_k 5^k$.\n\n**Step 1: finding $c_1$.**\nOur initial approximation is $r_0=0$. We seek $c_1$ such that $f(r_0+c_1 5) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^2}$.\n$f(c_1 5) = (c_1 5)^3 - 2(c_1 5) + 5 = 125c_1^3 - 10c_1 + 5$.\nWe need $125c_1^3 - 10c_1 + 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$. This simplifies to $-10c_1+5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nDividing by $5$, we get $-2c_1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which implies $2c_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Multiplying by $3$ (the inverse of $2$ mod $5$), we get $c_1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, $c_1=3$.\nOur first refined approximation is $r_1 = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15$.\n\n**Step 2: finding $c_2$.**\nWe seek $c_2$ such that $f(r_1+c_2 5^2) = f(15+25c_2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^3}$.\nUsing the Taylor expansion, $f(15+25c_2) \\equiv f(15) + f'(15)(25c_2) \\pmod{125}$.\n- $f(15) = 15^3 - 2(15) + 5 = 3375 - 30 + 5 = 3350$.\n$3350 = 26 \\cdot 125 + 100$, so $f(15) \\equiv 100 \\pmod{125}$.\n- $f'(15) = 3(15^2) - 2 = 3(225) - 2 = 673$.\n$673 = 5 \\cdot 125 + 48$, so $f'(15) \\equiv 48 \\pmod{125}$.\nThe congruence becomes $100 + 48(25c_2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}$.\nDividing by $25$: $4 + 48c_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nSince $48 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, we have $4+3c_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $3c_2 \\equiv -4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nMultiplying by $2$ gives $c_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, $c_2=2$.\nOur next approximation is $r_2 = 15 + 2 \\cdot 5^2 = 65$.\n\n**Step 3: finding $c_3$.**\nWe seek $c_3$ such that $f(r_2+c_3 5^3) = f(65+125c_3) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^4}$.\n$f(65+125c_3) \\equiv f(65) + f'(65)(125c_3) \\pmod{625}$.\n- $f(65) = 65^3 - 2(65) + 5 = 274625 - 130 + 5 = 274500$.\n$274500 = 439 \\cdot 625 + 125$, so $f(65) \\equiv 125 \\pmod{625}$.\n- $f'(65) = 3(65^2) - 2 = 3(4225) - 2 = 12673$.\n$12673 = 20 \\cdot 625 + 173$, so $f'(65) \\equiv 173 \\pmod{625}$.\nThe congruence is $125 + 173(125c_3) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{625}$.\nDividing by $125$: $1 + 173c_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nSince $173 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, we have $1+3c_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $3c_3 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\nMultiplying by $2$ gives $c_3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, $c_3=3$.\nOur next approximation is $r_3 = 65 + 3 \\cdot 5^3 = 440$.\n\n**Step 4: finding $c_4$.**\nWe seek $c_4$ such that $f(r_3+c_4 5^4) = f(440+625c_4) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^5}$.\n$f(440+625c_4) \\equiv f(440) + f'(440)(625c_4) \\pmod{3125}$.\n- $f(440) = 440^3 - 2(440) + 5 = 85184000 - 880 + 5 = 85183125$.\n$85183125 = 27258 \\cdot 3125 + 1875$, so $f(440) \\equiv 1875 \\pmod{3125}$.\n- $f'(440) = 3(440^2) - 2 = 3(193600) - 2 = 580798$.\n$580798 = 185 \\cdot 3125 + 2673$, so $f'(440) \\equiv 2673 \\pmod{3125}$.\nThe congruence is $1875 + 2673(625c_4) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3125}$.\nDividing by $625$: $3 + 2673c_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nSince $2673 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, we have $3+3c_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $3(1+c_4) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which implies $1+c_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nThis gives $c_4 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, $c_4=4$.\n\nThe truncated $5$-adic expansion of the root $r$ up to the $5^4$ term is:\n$r \\approx 3 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 5^2 + 3 \\cdot 5^3 + 4 \\cdot 5^4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 5^2 + 3 \\cdot 5^3 + 4 \\cdot 5^4}$$", "id": "3017272"}, {"introduction": "After finding roots within a local field, a natural next step is to construct extensions of it.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two main derivations. First, we will establish the properties of the field extension $L/K$. Second, we will calculate the $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ be the field of $p$-adic numbers, $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ its ring of integers, and $v_{p}$ the valuation on $K$ normalized such that $v_{p}(p) = 1$. The maximal ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $\\mathfrak{p} = p\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. The polynomial in question is $f(x) = x^{n} - p$, where $p$ is a prime and $n \\geq 2$ is an integer.\n\nFirst, we justify that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $K$. We apply the Eisenstein criterion for the prime element $p \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The coefficients of $f(x) = x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{0}$ are $a_{n}=1$, $a_{i}=0$ for $1 \\le i \\le n-1$, and $a_0 = -p$. The Eisenstein criterion requires:\n1.  The leading coefficient $a_{n}$ is not in $\\mathfrak{p}$. This holds, as $v_{p}(a_{n}) = v_{p}(1) = 0$.\n2.  All other coefficients $a_{i}$ for $0 \\le i \\le n-1$ are in $\\mathfrak{p}$. This holds, as $a_{i}=0$ for $1 \\le i \\le n-1$, and $v_{p}(0) = \\infty$, while $a_{0}=-p$ has $v_{p}(-p)=v_{p}(p)=1 \\ge 1$.\n3.  The constant term $a_{0}$ is not in $\\mathfrak{p}^{2} = p^{2}\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This holds, as $v_{p}(a_{0}) = v_{p}(-p) = 1 < 2$.\nSince all conditions are met, $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of fractions of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, which is $K = \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.\n\nBecause $f(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$, the degree of the field extension $L=K(\\alpha)$ is $[L:K] = \\deg(f) = n$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that the extension $L/K$ is totally ramified. Let $v_{L}$ be the unique extension of the valuation $v_p$ to $L$. Let $e=e(L/K)$ be the ramification index and $f=f(L/K)$ be the residue degree. The fundamental identity of valuation theory states that $ef = [L:K]=n$.\nFrom the defining equation $\\alpha^{n} - p = 0$, we have $\\alpha^{n}=p$. Taking the valuation $v_L$ of both sides yields:\n$$ v_{L}(\\alpha^{n}) = v_{L}(p) $$\n$$ n \\cdot v_{L}(\\alpha) = e \\cdot v_{p}(p) $$\nGiven $v_{p}(p)=1$, this simplifies to $n \\cdot v_{L}(\\alpha) = e$, which means $v_{L}(\\alpha) = \\frac{e}{n}$.\nThe residue field of $K$ is $k = \\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{p} \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{p}$. The reduction of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $\\mathfrak{p}$ is $\\bar{f}(x) = x^{n} - \\bar{p} = x^{n}$ in $k[x]$. The minimal polynomial of the residue of $\\alpha$, let's call it $\\bar{\\alpha}$, over $k$ must divide $\\bar{f}(x)$. The only monic irreducible factor of $x^{n}$ in $k[x]$ is $x$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $\\bar{\\alpha}$ must be $x$, which implies $\\bar{\\alpha}=0$. The degree of the residue field extension is the degree of this minimal polynomial, so $f = [k(\\bar{\\alpha}) : k] = [k(0):k]=1$.\nSubstituting $f=1$ into the identity $ef=n$ gives $e=n$. An extension is called totally ramified if its ramification index equals its degree. Since $e=n=[L:K]$, the extension $L/K$ is totally ramified.\n\nA uniformizer for $L$ is an element $\\pi_{L} \\in L$ such that $v_{L}(\\pi_{L})=1$. We found that $v_{L}(\\alpha) = \\frac{e}{n}$. With $e=n$, we have $v_{L}(\\alpha) = \\frac{n}{n} = 1$. Thus, $\\alpha$ is a uniformizer for $L$.\n\nNow, we proceed to derive the expression for $v_{p}(\\mathrm{Disc}(f))$. The problem directs the use of the formula that relates the discriminant of a monic minimal polynomial to the field norm of its derivative evaluated at a root. For a polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n$ with root $\\alpha$, this is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Disc}(f) = (-1)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} N_{L/K}(f'(\\alpha)) $$\nThe derivative of $f(x) = x^{n} - p$ is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$. Evaluating at $x=\\alpha$, we get $f'(\\alpha) = n\\alpha^{n-1}$. We must compute the norm of this element, $N_{L/K}(n\\alpha^{n-1})$. Using the multiplicative property of the norm, we have:\n$$ N_{L/K}(n\\alpha^{n-1}) = N_{L/K}(n) \\cdot N_{L/K}(\\alpha^{n-1}) $$\nFirst, for the element $n \\in K$, its norm is $N_{L/K}(n) = n^{[L:K]} = n^{n}$.\nSecond, for the element $\\alpha^{n-1}$, we use the property $N_{L/K}(x^{k}) = (N_{L/K}(x))^{k}$. We first find $N_{L/K}(\\alpha)$. The norm of a root of a monic polynomial $g(x) = x^{m} + c_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \\dots + c_0$ is given by $(-1)^{m}c_0$. For $f(x) = x^{n}-p$, the degree is $n$ and the constant term is $a_{0}=-p$. Thus,\n$$ N_{L/K}(\\alpha) = (-1)^{n}a_{0} = (-1)^{n}(-p) = (-1)^{n+1}p $$\nUsing this, we calculate the norm of $\\alpha^{n-1}$:\n$$ N_{L/K}(\\alpha^{n-1}) = (N_{L/K}(\\alpha))^{n-1} = ((-1)^{n+1}p)^{n-1} = (-1)^{(n+1)(n-1)}p^{n-1} = (-1)^{n^{2}-1}p^{n-1} $$\nNow we combine these parts to find $N_{L/K}(f'(\\alpha))$:\n$$ N_{L/K}(n\\alpha^{n-1}) = n^{n} \\cdot (-1)^{n^{2}-1}p^{n-1} $$\nSubstituting this into the discriminant formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{Disc}(f) = (-1)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \\left( n^{n} \\cdot (-1)^{n^{2}-1}p^{n-1} \\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n^{2} - 1} n^{n} p^{n-1} $$\nThe final step is to compute the $p$-adic valuation $v_{p}$ of this expression.

This means:\n$$\n(a_1 a_2, b)_p = (a_1, b)_p (a_2, b)_p \\\\\n(a, b_1 b_2)_p = (a, b_1)_p (a, b_2)_p\n$$\nUsing this property, we can expand $(a,b)_p$:\n$$\n(a,b)_p = (p^{\\alpha}u, p^{\\beta}v)_p = (p^{\\alpha}, p^{\\beta}v)_p (u, p^{\\beta}v)_p \\\\\n= (p^{\\alpha}, p^{\\beta})_p (p^{\\alpha}, v)_p (u, p^{\\beta})_p (u,v)_p \\\\\n= (p,p)_p^{\\alpha\\beta} (p,v)_p^{\\alpha} (u,p)_p^{\\beta} (u,v)_p\n$$\nTo obtain an explicit formula, we must evaluate each of these four terms based on the definition of the Hilbert symbol. The symbol $(x,y)_p$ is defined via the local reciprocity map $\\operatorname{rec}_K: K^\\times \\to \\operatorname{Gal}(K^{\\text{ab}}/K)$. Specifically, for the extension $L=K(\\sqrt{x})$, the value $(x,y)_p$ describes the action of $\\operatorname{rec}_K(y)$ on $\\sqrt{x}$: $\\operatorname{rec}_K(y)(\\sqrt{x}) = (x,y)_p\\sqrt{x}$. Equivalently, $(x,y)_p=1$ if and only if $y$ is a norm from the extension $K(\\sqrt{x})/K$.\n\n1.  Evaluation of $(u,v)_p$ for $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$.\n    The extension $L=K(\\sqrt{u})/K$ is unramified because $p$ is odd and $v_p(u)=0$. The local reciprocity map is known to map units to the inertia subgroup, i.e., $\\operatorname{rec}_K(\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times) \\subseteq I(K^{\\text{ab}}/K)$. For an unramified extension such as $L/K$, the inertia subgroup of its Galois group is trivial. Thus, the action of $\\operatorname{rec}_K(v)$ on $L$ is the identity.\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{rec}_K(v)(\\sqrt{u}) = \\sqrt{u}\n    $$\n    By definition, this implies $(u,v)_p = 1$.\n\n2.  Evaluation of $(u,p)_p$ for $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$.\n    Again, we consider the unramified extension $L=K(\\sqrt{u})/K$. The reciprocity map sends the uniformizer $p$ to the Frobenius automorphism $\\phi \\in \\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$. The action of the Frobenius is determined by its action on the residue field extension $\\mathbb{F}_p(\\sqrt{\\bar{u}})/\\mathbb{F}_p$, where $\\bar{u}$ is the image of $u$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p=\\mathbb{Z}_p/p\\mathbb{Z}_p$. The Frobenius map on the residue field is $z \\mapsto z^p$.\n    $$\n    \\phi(\\sqrt{\\bar{u}}) = (\\sqrt{\\bar{u}})^p = \\bar{u}^{(p-1)/2}\\sqrt{\\bar{u}}\n    $$\n    By definition, $\\bar{u}^{(p-1)/2}$ is the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{p})$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This action lifts to $L/K$.\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{rec}_K(p)(\\sqrt{u}) = \\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{p}\\right)\\sqrt{u}\n    $$\n    Therefore, by definition of the Hilbert symbol, $(u,p)_p = (\\frac{\\bar{u}}{p})$.\n\n3.  Evaluation of $(p,p)_p$.\n    We use the fundamental property $(x,-x)_p=1$ for any $x \\in K^\\times$. This follows from the norm definition, as $-x = 0^2 - x \\cdot 1^2 = N_{K(\\sqrt{x})/K}(0+1\\cdot\\sqrt{x})$ is always a norm from $K(\\sqrt{x})$.\n    Setting $x=p$, we have $(p,-p)_p=1$. Using bilinearity:\n    $$\n    (p,-p)_p = (p, p \\cdot (-1))_p = (p,p)_p (p,-1)_p = 1\n    $$\n    This implies $(p,p)_p = (p,-1)_p$.\n    To evaluate $(p,-1)_p$, we check when $-1$ is a norm from $K(\\sqrt{p})/K$. This requires determining if the equation $x^2 - py^2 = -1$ has a solution $(x,y)$ in $K=\\mathbb{Q}_p$. Rearranging gives $x^2+1=py^2$.\n    If there exists $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$, then by Hensel's lemma (since $p$ is odd), there exists an $X \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $X^2=-1$. Then $(X,0)$ is a solution to $X^2-p(0)^2=-1$. This is possible if and only if $(\\frac{-1}{p})=1$. In this case, $(p,-1)_p=1$.\n    If $(\\frac{-1}{p})=-1$, then for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, $x^2+1$ is not divisible by $p$, so $v_p(x^2+1)=0$. However, $v_p(py^2) = 1+2v_p(y)$, which can never be $0$. If $v_p(x)<0$, say $v_p(x)=-k$ with $k>0$, then $v_p(x^2+1)=-2k$. We need $-2k=1+2v_p(y)$, which is impossible. So no solution exists.\n    Thus, $(p,-1)_p=1$ if $(\\frac{-1}{p})=1$ and $(p,-1)_p=-1$ if $(\\frac{-1}{p})=-1$. This means $(p,-1)_p = (\\frac{-1}{p})$.\n    We know $(\\frac{-1}{p}) = (-1)^{(p-1)/2}$.\n    Therefore, $(p,p)_p = (-1)^{(p-1)/2}$.\n\nCombining these results, the explicit formula for the Hilbert symbol for an odd prime $p$ is:\n$$\n(a,b)_p = (p^{\\alpha}u, p^{\\beta}v)_p = (-1)^{\\alpha\\beta\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{p}\\right)^{\\beta} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{v}}{p}\\right)^{\\alpha}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{u}$ and $\\bar{v}$ are the residue classes of $u$ and $v$ modulo $p$.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the specific case given in the problem:\n- Prime $p=19$.\n- $a = 19^1 \\cdot 6$. Here, $\\alpha=v_{19}(a)=1$ and the unit is $u=6$. The residue is $\\bar{u}=6 \\pmod{19}$.\n- $b = 19^4 \\cdot 3$. Here, $\\beta=v_{19}(b)=4$ and the unit is $v=3$. The residue is $\\bar{v}=3 \\pmod{19}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\n(a,b)_{19} = (-1)^{(1)(4)\\frac{19-1}{2}} \\left(\\frac{6}{19}\\right)^{4} \\left(\\frac{3}{19}\\right)^{1}\n$$\nLet's compute each part:\n- The exponent of $-1$ is $(1)(4)\\frac{18}{2} = 4 \\cdot 9 = 36$. So $(-1)^{36} = 1$.\n- The term $(\\frac{6}{19})^4$: The Legendre symbol $(\\frac{6}{19})$ is either $1$ or $-1$. In either case, raising it to the power of $4$ yields $1$.\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n(a,b)_{19} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{19}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{19}\\right)\n$$\nTo compute the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{3}{19})$, we use the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, which states that for distinct odd primes $p$ and $q$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{q-1}{2}}\n$$\nWith $q=3$ and $p=19$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{3}{19}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{19}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{19-1}{2}\\frac{3-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{19}{3}\\right) (-1)^{9 \\cdot 1} = -\\left(\\frac{19}{3}\\right)\n$$\nNow we evaluate $(\\frac{19}{3})$ by finding the residue of $19$ modulo $3$:\n$$\n19 = 6 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\implies 19 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n$$\nSo,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{19}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1\n$$\nsince $1$ is always a quadratic residue.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{3}{19}\\right) = -1\n$$\nTherefore, the value of the Hilbert symbol is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3017333"}]}
