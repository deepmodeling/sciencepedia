We must first justify the existence and uniqueness of such a root using Hensel's lemma, and then compute this root modulo $p^3$.\n\n**Part 1: Justification using Hensel's Lemma**\n\nHensel's Lemma, in a common form, states that if for a polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ there exists an integer $a_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $f(a_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ and its formal derivative $f'(a_0) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, then there exists a unique root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $f(\\alpha) = 0$ and $\\alpha \\equiv a_0 \\pmod p$.\n\nLet's apply this lemma to our problem.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^2 - (1+4p)$.\nIts formal derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$.\n\nThe problem directs us to seek a root $x$ such that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. We therefore choose our initial approximation to be $a_0 = 1$.\n\nWe check the two conditions of Hensel's Lemma:\n\n1.  Evaluate $f(a_0) \\pmod p$:\n    $$f(1) = 1^2 - (1+4p) = -4p$$\n    Since $-4p$ is an integer multiple of $p$, we have $f(1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. The first condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  Evaluate $f'(a_0) \\pmod p$:\n    $$f'(1) = 2(1) = 2$$\n    The problem states that $p$ is an odd prime, so $p \\neq 2$. Therefore, $2$ is not divisible by $p$, which means $f'(1) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. The second condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions of Hensel's Lemma hold for $a_0=1$, we can conclude that there exists a unique root $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $f(x) = 0$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the root modulo $p^3$**\n\nWe will find the root $x$ by determining its $p$-adic expansion up to the $p^2$ term. A $p$-adic integer $x$ can be written as a power series in $p$: $x = c_0 + c_1 p + c_2 p^2 + \\dots$, where the coefficients $c_i$ are integers in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\n\nFrom the condition $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, we immediately know that the first coefficient is $c_0 = 1$. Our first approximation is $x_0 = 1$.\n\nNext, we find the root modulo $p^2$. Let the root be $x_1 = c_0 + c_1 p = 1 + c_1 p$. We require $f(x_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$.\n$$f(1+c_1 p) = (1+c_1 p)^2 - (1+4p) = 1 + 2c_1 p + c_1^2 p^2 - 1 - 4p = (2c_1 - 4)p + c_1^2 p^2$$\nFor this to be congruent to $0$ modulo $p^2$, we must have $(2c_1 - 4)p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$. This is equivalent to $2c_1 - 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$.\n$$2c_1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod p$$\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $2$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$. Multiplying by this inverse, we get:\n$$c_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod p$$\nAs we require $c_1 \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$, we must have $c_1 = 2$.\nThus, the approximation of the root modulo $p^2$ is $x \\equiv 1 + 2p \\pmod{p^2}$.\n\nFinally, we find the root modulo $p^3$. Let the root be $x_2 = c_0 + c_1 p + c_2 p^2 = 1 + 2p + c_2 p^2$. We require $f(x_2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^3}$.\n$$f(1 + 2p + c_2 p^2) = (1 + 2p + c_2 p^2)^2 - (1+4p)$$\nLet's expand the square. We can group the terms as $((1+2p) + c_2 p^2)^2$:\n$$(1+2p)^2 + 2(1+2p)(c_2 p^2) + (c_2 p^2)^2 - (1+4p)$$\nThe term $(c_2 p^2)^2 = c_2^2 p^4$ is divisible by $p^3$ since $p \\ge 3$, so it is congruent to $0 \\pmod{p^3}$.\nThe expansion becomes:\n$$(1+4p+4p^2) + 2(1+2p)c_2p^2 - (1+4p) \\pmod{p^3}$$\nCombining terms, we get:\n$$4p^2 + (2+4p)c_2p^2 \\pmod{p^3}$$\n$$4p^2 + 2c_2p^2 + 4c_2p^3 \\pmod{p^3}$$\nThe term $4c_2p^3$ is congruent to $0 \\pmod{p^3}$. We are left with:\n$$(4 + 2c_2)p^2 \\pmod{p^3}$$\nFor this to be congruent to $0$ modulo $p^3$, we must have $4 + 2c_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$.\n$$2c_2 \\equiv -4 \\pmod p$$\nAgain, since $p$ is odd, we can divide by $2$:\n$$c_2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod p$$\nAs $c_2 \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$, we choose $c_2 = p-2$.\n\nSubstituting the coefficients back, the root modulo $p^3$ is:\n$$x \\equiv c_0 + c_1 p + c_2 p^2 \\pmod{p^3}$$\n$$x \\equiv 1 + 2p + (p-2)p^2 \\pmod{p^3}$$\n$$x \\equiv 1 + 2p + p^3 - 2p^2 \\pmod{p^3}$$\nSince $p^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^3}$, this simplifies to:\n$$x \\equiv 1 + 2p - 2p^2 \\pmod{p^3}$$\nThis is the desired class of the root $x$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_p/p^3\\mathbb{Z}_p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 + 2p - 2p^2}$$", "id": "3010249"}, {"introduction": "Moving from analysis within $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ to its algebraic extensions, we encounter the fundamental concepts of ramification and inertia.

We are given the standard $p$-adic valuation $v_p$ on $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ normalized by $v_p(p)=1$.\n\nLet $n$ be the degree of the extension, $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}_p]$. For a finite extension of a complete non-archimedean field, the degree, ramification index, and residue degree are related by the fundamental identity $n = ef$. We will proceed by first determining the degree $n$, then the ramification index $e$, and finally the residue degree $f$.\n\nFirst, we determine the degree of the extension $n=[K:\\mathbb{Q}_p]$. The field $K$ is obtained by adjoining a root $\\pi$ of the polynomial $P(x) = x^d - p$ to $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. The degree of the extension is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\pi$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. We will show that $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ using Eisenstein's criterion with respect to the prime $p$.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ be the ring of $p$-adic integers, which is the valuation ring of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. The maximal ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is $\\mathfrak{m}_p = p\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Eisenstein's criterion for a polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ states that if a monic polynomial $a_d x^d + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ (with $a_d = 1$) satisfies $v_p(a_i) \\geq 1$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$ and $v_p(a_0) = 1$, then the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nIn our case, the polynomial is $P(x) = x^d - p$. This is a monic polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. The coefficients are $a_d=1$, $a_1 = a_2 = \\dots = a_{d-1} = 0$, and $a_0 = -p$.\nWe check the conditions for Eisenstein's criterion:\n1.  For $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, d-1\\}$, the coefficients are $a_i = 0$. The valuation $v_p(0) = \\infty$, and we have $\\infty \\geq 1$. This condition is satisfied.\n2.  For the constant term $a_0 = -p$, its valuation is $v_p(-p) = v_p(-1) + v_p(p) = 0 + 1 = 1$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $P(x)=x^d-p$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. Therefore, it is the minimal polynomial of $\\pi$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, and the degree of the extension is $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}_p] = \\deg(P(x)) = d$.\n\nNext, we compute the ramification index $e$. The problem states that $w$ is an extension of the valuation $v_p$ to $K$. It is a standard result that for a finite extension of a complete valued field, the valuation extends uniquely. The ramification index $e$ is defined as the index of the value groups: $e = [w(K^\\times) : v_p(\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times)]$. The value group of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is $v_p(\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe are given $\\pi^d=p$. Applying the valuation $w$ to both sides of this equation, we get:\n$w(\\pi^d) = w(p)$\nUsing the property $w(x^k) = k \\cdot w(x)$, this becomes:\n$d \\cdot w(\\pi) = w(p)$\nSince $w$ is an extension of $v_p$, $w(p) = v_p(p) = 1$. Thus:\n$d \\cdot w(\\pi) = 1$\nThis implies that $w(\\pi) = \\frac{1}{d}$.\n\nThe value group of $K$, $w(K^\\times)$, is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\pi \\in K^\\times$, $w(\\pi) = \\frac{1}{d}$ must be an element of $w(K^\\times)$. As $w(K^\\times)$ is a group, it must contain the subgroup generated by $\\frac{1}{d}$, which is $\\frac{1}{d}\\mathbb{Z}$. The value group $w(K^\\times)$ also contains $w(\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times) = v_p(\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $w(K^\\times)$ contains the group generated by $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\frac{1}{d}$, which is $\\frac{1}{d}\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, we have $\\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq w(K^\\times)$. The ramification index is $e = [w(K^\\times) : \\mathbb{Z}]$. Since $\\frac{1}{d}\\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq w(K^\\times)$, we must have:\n$e = [w(K^\\times) : \\mathbb{Z}] \\ge [\\frac{1}{d}\\mathbb{Z} : \\mathbb{Z}] = d$.\nSo, we have established that $e \\ge d$.\n\nFinally, we use the fundamental identity $n = ef$. We have $n=d$ and $e \\ge d$. The residue degree $f = [k_K : k_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}]$ is the degree of the extension of residue fields. As such, it must be a positive integer, so $f \\ge 1$.\nSubstituting our findings into the identity gives:\n$d = ef$\nWith the constraints $e \\ge d$ and $f \\ge 1$, the only integer solution is $e=d$ and $f=1$.\n\nThe problem asks to justify that the extension is totally ramified. An extension is defined as totally ramified if its ramification index equals the degree of the extension, i.e., $e=n$. In our case, $e=d$ and $n=d$, so the extension is indeed totally ramified.\nAn equivalent condition for a totally ramified extension is that the residue degree is $1$, i.e., $f=1$. This implies that $[k_K : k_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}] = 1$, where $k_K$ and $k_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ are the residue fields of $K$ and $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, respectively. This means that $k_K$ is a trivial extension of $k_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$. The residue field of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is $k_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} = \\mathbb{Z}_p / p\\mathbb{Z}_p \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p$. Therefore, the residue field of $K$ is also $\\mathbb{F}_p$, meaning it coincides with that of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, as stated in the problem. The element $\\pi$ is a uniformizer for $K$, as $w(\\pi) = \\frac{1}{d} = \\frac{1}{e}$.\n\nThe given condition $p \\nmid d$ indicates that the extension is tamely ramified, as the ramification index $e=d$ is not divisible by the characteristic of the residue field $p$. This information, while significant for describing the fine structure of the extension, is not necessary for the computation of $e$ and $f$.\n\nThe ramification index is $e=d$ and the residue degree is $f=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} d & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3010259"}, {"introduction": "While Hensel's lemma is a powerful constructive tool, the Newton polygon provides invaluable diagnostic information about the roots of a polynomial before we even attempt to find them.

Points with larger $i$-coordinates give strictly positive slopes: e.g., slope to $(3,1)$ is $1/3$. The first side of the lower convex hull is the segment from $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$. This segment has slope $m_1 = \\frac{0-0}{2-0} = 0$ and horizontal length (the difference in the $x$-coordinates) $l_1 = 2-0=2$.\n2.  The second segment starts at $(2,0)$.

The point $(3,1)$ lies on this segment.\n\nThe Newton polygon consists of two segments with slopes $m_1=0$ (length $l_1=2$) and $m_2=1$ (length $l_2=2$).\n\nThese slopes and lengths control the properties of the roots of $f(x)$. The main theorem concerning Newton polygons states that for each segment of the polygon with slope $m$ and horizontal length $l$, there are exactly $l$ roots of the polynomial (in the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$) having $p$-adic valuation equal to $m$. Furthermore, this implies a factorization of the polynomial $f(x) = \\prod_j F_j(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_p[x]$, where each $F_j(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $l_j$ whose roots are precisely those $l_j$ roots of $f(x)$ with valuation $m_j$.

The coefficients of $f(x)$ are integers, so $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$. We reduce $f(x)$ modulo $5$:\n$f(x) \\equiv x^4 + (5+1)x^3 + (6\\cdot 5+1)x^2 + (6\\cdot 5)x + 5^2 \\pmod{5}$\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 \\in \\mathbb{F}_5[x]$.\nWe factor $\\bar{f}(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2(x^2+x+1)$.\nLet $\\bar{h}_0(x) = x^2+x+1$ and $\\bar{g}_0(x)=x^2$.

Thus, $\\gcd(\\bar{g}_0(x), \\bar{h}_0(x))=1$.\n\nWe now state and apply Hensel's Lemma.\n**Hensel's Lemma:** Let $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ be a polynomial. If its reduction $\\bar{f}(x) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ can be factored as $\\bar{f}(x)=\\bar{g}_0(x)\\bar{h}_0(x)$ where $\\bar{g}_0(x)$ and $\\bar{h}_0(x)$ are monic coprime polynomials in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, then there exists a unique pair of monic polynomials $g(x), h(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ such that $f(x)=g(x)h(x)$, $\\bar{g}(x)=\\bar{g}_0(x)$, $\\bar{h}(x)=\\bar{h}_0(x)$, and $\\deg(g)=\\deg(\\bar{g}_0)$, $\\deg(h)=\\deg(\\bar{h}_0)$.\n\nApplying this to our polynomial $f(x)$ with $p=5$, $\\bar{g}_0(x)=x^2$, and $\\bar{h}_0(x)=x^2+x+1$, we conclude there exist unique monic quadratic polynomials $g(x), h(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$ such that $f(x)=g(x)h(x)$ with:\n$g(x) \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 5$\n$h(x) \\equiv x^2+x+1 \\pmod 5$\n\nThis factorization is consistent with the Newton polygon analysis. The roots of $h(x)$ must reduce to the roots of $x^2+x+1 \\pmod 5$, which are non-zero. This means the roots of $h(x)$ must be $5$-adic units, i.e., have valuation $0$. The roots of $g(x)$ must reduce to the root of $x^2 \\pmod 5$, which is $0$. This implies the roots of $g(x)$ have positive valuation ($v_5 > 0$). This matches our prediction from the Newton polygon: two roots with valuation $0$ (from $h(x)$) and two roots with valuation $1$ (from $g(x)$).\n\nTo find the explicit factorization, we lift the factorization from $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.

The condition is $g_0w+h_0u \\equiv \\frac{f-g_0h_0}{5} \\pmod 5$.\n$x^2 w(x) + (x^2+x+1)u(x) \\equiv x^3+x^2+x \\pmod 5$.\nLet $u(x) = ax+b$ and $w(x)=cx+d$.\n$x^2(cx+d) + (x^2+x+1)(ax+b) \\equiv x^3+x^2+x \\pmod 5$\n$cx^3+dx^2 + ax^3+bx^2+ax^2+bx+ax+b \\equiv x^3+x^2+x \\pmod 5$\n$(c+a)x^3 + (d+b+a)x^2 + (b+a)x + b \\equiv x^3+x^2+x \\pmod 5$.\nComparing coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_5$:\n- Constant: $b \\equiv 0$.\n- $x$ coefficient: $a+b \\equiv 1 \\implies a \\equiv 1$.\n- $x^2$ coefficient: $a+b+d \\equiv 1 \\implies 1+0+d \\equiv 1 \\implies d \\equiv 0$.\n- $x^3$ coefficient: $a+c \\equiv 1 \\implies 1+c \\equiv 1 \\implies c \\equiv 0$.\nSo $u(x)=x$ and $w(x)=0$.\n\nThe updated factors, accurate modulo $25$, are:\n$g_1(x) = g_0(x)+5u(x) = x^2+5x$\n$h_1(x) = h_0(x)+5w(x) = x^2+x+1$\n\nLet's check their product:\n$g_1(x)h_1(x) = (x^2+5x)(x^2+x+1) = x^4+x^3+x^2+5x^3+5x^2+5x = x^4+6x^3+6x^2+5x$.\nNow we compute the new error term:\n$f(x) - g_1(x)h_1(x) = (x^4+6x^3+31x^2+30x+25) - (x^4+6x^3+6x^2+5x)$\n$= 25x^2+25x+25 = 25(x^2+x+1)$.\n\nNotice that this error term is $25\\cdot h_1(x)$.\nSo, $f(x) = g_1(x)h_1(x) + 25h_1(x)$.\nWe can factor out $h_1(x)$:\n$f(x) = (g_1(x)+25)h_1(x) = (x^2+5x+25)(x^2+x+1)$.\nThis factorization is exact and involves polynomials with integer coefficients. The factors are monic.\n$g(x) = x^2+5x+25$ reduces to $x^2 \\pmod 5$.\n$h(x) = x^2+x+1$ reduces to $x^2+x+1 \\pmod 5$.\nBy the uniqueness of the Hensel lift, this must be the factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.\n\nThus, the explicit monic factorization of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_5[x]$ (and in fact in $\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$) is $(x^2+x+1)(x^2+5x+25)$.\nFinal verification:\n$(x^2+x+1)(x^2+5x+25) = x^2(x^2+5x+25)+x(x^2+5x+25)+1(x^2+5x+25)$\n$= (x^4+5x^3+25x^2) + (x^3+5x^2+25x) + (x^2+5x+25)$\n$= x^4 + (5+1)x^3 + (25+5+1)x^2 + (25+5)x + 25$\n$= x^4+6x^3+31x^2+30x+25$.\nThe factorization is correct.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(x^2+x+1)(x^2+5x+25)}\n$$", "id": "3010264"}]}
