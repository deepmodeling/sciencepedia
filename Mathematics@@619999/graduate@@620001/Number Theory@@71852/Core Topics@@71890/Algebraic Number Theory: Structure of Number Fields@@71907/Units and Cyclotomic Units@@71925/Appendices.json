It consists of a standard set of tasks in algebraic number theory. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe quadratic number field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{34})$. We are asked to perform a series of tasks related to its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and its group of units $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$.\n\n1. Identification of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and the Field Norm\n\nFor a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is determined by the value of $d$ modulo $4$. In our case, $d=34$. Since $34$ is not divisible by any perfect square other than $1$, it is square-free. We check its congruence class: $34 = 4 \\times 8 + 2$, so $34 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nFor cases where $d \\equiv 2$ or $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is given by $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$. Therefore, for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{34})$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{34}] = \\{x+y\\sqrt{34} \\mid x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nAn arbitrary element $\\alpha \\in K$ can be written as $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{34}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is defined by the product of the element and its Galois conjugate. The conjugate of $\\alpha$ is $\\overline{\\alpha} = a-b\\sqrt{34}$.\nThe norm is thus $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\overline{\\alpha} = (a+b\\sqrt{34})(a-b\\sqrt{34}) = a^2 - 34b^2$.\nFor an element $x+y\\sqrt{34} \\in K$ (where $x,y$ are generally in $\\mathbb{Q}$, but specifically in $\\mathbb{Z}$ if the element is in $\\mathcal{O}_K$), the norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(x+y\\sqrt{34}) = x^2 - 34y^2$.\n\n2. Continued Fraction Expansion and Pell's Equation\n\nTo find the fundamental unit of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, we study the solutions to the Pell-type equation $x^2 - 34y^2 = \\pm 1$, where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The minimal positive integer solution $(x,y)$ to this equation is found via the simple continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{34}$. We compute this expansion using the standard algorithm. Let $\\xi_0 = \\sqrt{34}$.\n\n$a_0 = \\lfloor\\sqrt{34}\\rfloor = 5$, since $5^2 = 25$ and $6^2 = 36$.\n$\\xi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}-5} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+5}{34-25} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+5}{9}$.\n$a_1 = \\lfloor\\xi_1\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{5+\\sqrt{34}}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{5+5.83\\dots}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.20\\dots \\rfloor = 1$.\n\n$\\xi_2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{34}+5}{9}-1} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{34}-4} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{34-16} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{18} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{2}$.\n$a_2 = \\lfloor\\xi_2\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+\\sqrt{34}}{2}\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+5.83\\dots}{2}\\rfloor = \\lfloor 4.91\\dots \\rfloor = 4$.\n\n$\\xi_3 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{2}-4} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{34}-4} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{34-16} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{18} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{9}$.\n$a_3 = \\lfloor\\xi_3\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+\\sqrt{34}}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+5.83\\dots}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.09\\dots \\rfloor = 1$.\n\n$\\xi_4 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{9}-1} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{34}-5} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+5)}{34-25} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+5)}{9} = \\sqrt{34}+5$.\n$a_4 = \\lfloor\\sqrt{34}+5\\rfloor = 5+5 = 10$.\n\n$\\xi_5 = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{34}+5)-10} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}-5} = \\xi_1$.\nSince $\\xi_5=\\xi_1$, the sequence of partial quotients $a_i$ is periodic from $a_1$ onwards. The continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{34}$ is $[5; \\overline{1, 4, 1, 10}]$. The length of the period is $k=4$.\n\nThe fundamental solution to $x^2 - 34y^2 = (-1)^k$ is given by the numerator $p_{k-1}$ and denominator $q_{k-1}$ of the $(k-1)$-th convergent of this expansion. Here $k=4$, so we need the $3$rd convergent, $p_3/q_3$. We calculate the convergents using the recurrence relations $p_n = a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}$ and $q_n = a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}$, with initial values $p_{-2}=0, p_{-1}=1$ and $q_{-2}=1, q_{-1}=0$.\n\n$a_0=5: \\quad p_0 = 5(1)+0=5, \\quad q_0=5(0)+1=1$.\n$a_1=1: \\quad p_1 = 1(5)+1=6, \\quad q_1=1(1)+0=1$.\n$a_2=4: \\quad p_2 = 4(6)+5=29, \\quad q_2=4(1)+1=5$.\n$a_3=1: \\quad p_3 = 1(29)+6=35, \\quad q_3=1(5)+1=6$.\n\nThe convergent is $p_3/q_3 = 35/6$. This gives the candidate solution $(x,y)=(35,6)$. We check this in the associated Pell-type equation. Since the period length $k=4$ is even, we expect this solution to satisfy $x^2-34y^2=1$:\n$35^2 - 34(6^2) = 1225 - 34(36) = 1225 - 1224 = 1$.\nThe equation is satisfied. The pair $(x,y)=(35,6)$ is the minimal positive integer solution to $x^2 - 34y^2 = 1$.\n\n3. Construction of a Unit and Analysis via Dirichlet's Unit Theorem\n\nAn element $\\epsilon \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is a unit if its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\epsilon)$ is $\\pm 1$. The solution $(x,y)=(35,6)$ found in part 2 gives us the element $\\epsilon = 35+6\\sqrt{34}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{34}]$. Its norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\epsilon) = 35^2 - 34(6^2) = 1$. As its norm is $1$, $\\epsilon$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$.\n\nWe now explain from first principles why the subgroup $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle = \\{\\epsilon^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ has a finite index in the full group of units $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$. The argument relies on the Dirichlet Unit Theorem.\n\nThe theorem states that for a number field $K$, the group of units $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ is a finitely generated abelian group with structure $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} \\cong \\mu(K) \\times \\mathbb{Z}^r$, where $\\mu(K)$ is the finite group of roots of unity in $K$ and $r$ is the rank. The rank is given by $r = r_1+r_2-1$, where $r_1$ is the number of real embeddings of $K$ and $r_2$ is the number of conjugate pairs of complex embeddings.\n\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{34})$, since $34>0$, it is a real quadratic field. It has two distinct real embeddings into $\\mathbb{C}$: $\\sigma_1(a+b\\sqrt{34}) = a+b\\sqrt{34}$ and $\\sigma_2(a+b\\sqrt{34}) = a-b\\sqrt{34}$. Both map into $\\mathbb{R}$, so $r_1=2$ and $r_2=0$. The rank of the unit group is $r = 2+0-1 = 1$. The roots of unity in a real quadratic field are only $\\{1, -1\\}$, so $\\mu(K) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$.\nThus, the structure of the unit group is $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} \\cong \\{\\pm 1\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies the existence of a fundamental unit $\\epsilon_1 > 1$ such that any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ can be uniquely written in the form $u = \\pm \\epsilon_1^n$ for some integer $n$.\n\nThe connection to this structure is made via the logarithmic embedding $L: K^{\\times} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{r_1+r_2}$. For our field, $L: K^{\\times} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by $L(\\alpha) = (\\ln|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)|, \\ln|\\sigma_2(\\alpha)|)$. For any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$, we have $N(u) = \\sigma_1(u)\\sigma_2(u) = \\pm 1$. Taking absolute values, $|\\sigma_1(u)||\\sigma_2(u)| = 1$. Applying the natural logarithm, we get $\\ln|\\sigma_1(u)| + \\ln|\\sigma_2(u)| = 0$. This shows that the image of the units, $L(\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times})$, is contained in the $1$-dimensional subspace (a line) $H = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x_1+x_2 = 0\\}$.\n\nThe Dirichlet Unit Theorem further specifies that $L(\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times})$ is a lattice of rank $r=1$ in this subspace $H$. A rank-$1$ lattice is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}\\mathbf{v}$ for some basis vector $\\mathbf{v}$. This basis vector is the image of the fundamental unit, $\\mathbf{v} = L(\\epsilon_1)$.\nThe kernel of the logarithmic map restricted to $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times$ consists of units $u$ with $|\\sigma_i(u)|=1$ for all $i$. These are precisely the roots of unity, so $\\ker(L|_{\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times}) = \\mu(K) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n\nThe theory of continued fractions ensures that for $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ with $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, the unit $\\epsilon = x+y\\sqrt{d}$ constructed from the minimal positive integer solution to $x^2-dy^2=1$ is precisely the fundamental unit $\\epsilon_1 > 1$. In our case, $\\epsilon = 35+6\\sqrt{34}$ is the fundamental unit.\nThus, $L(\\epsilon)$ is a generator for the lattice $L(\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times})$. This means that for any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$, its image $L(u)$ must be an integer multiple of $L(\\epsilon)$, i.e., $L(u) = nL(\\epsilon)$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis implies $L(u) - L(\\epsilon^n) = L(u/\\epsilon^n) = \\mathbf{0}$. An element whose image under $L$ is the zero vector must be in the kernel of $L$, which is $\\{\\pm 1\\}$. So, $u/\\epsilon^n = \\pm 1$, which means $u = \\pm \\epsilon^n$.\nThis confirms that every unit is of the form $\\pm \\epsilon^n$. The group of units is $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times = \\{\\pm \\epsilon^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The subgroup generated by $\\epsilon$ is $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle = \\{\\epsilon^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\nThe quotient group $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} / \\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$ has elements which are the cosets $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$ and $(-\\epsilon)\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$, which is just $\\{1\\cdot\\langle\\epsilon\\rangle, -1\\cdot\\langle\\epsilon\\rangle\\}$. This quotient group is isomorphic to $\\{\\pm 1\\}$. The index of the subgroup $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ is the order of this quotient group, which is $|\\{\\pm 1\\}|=2$. Since the index is $2$, it is finite.\n\n4.

Use the tower property to deduce $N_{K/K^+}(1-\\zeta_4)$**\n\nThe problem specifies the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K^+ \\subset K$.

The field extension $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Q}$ has degree $1$. The only $\\mathbb{Q}$-embedding of $\\mathbb{Q}$ into $\\mathbb{C}$ is the identity map.

Dividing by $\\zeta_9^3$ yields $\\zeta_9^3 + 1 + \\zeta_9^{-3} = 0$.\nThe powers of $\\eta$ are:\n$\\eta = \\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}$\n$\\eta^2 = \\zeta_9^2 + 2 + \\zeta_9^{-2}$\n$\\eta^3 = \\zeta_9^3 + 3\\zeta_9 + 3\\zeta_9^{-1} + \\zeta_9^{-3} = (\\zeta_9^3 + \\zeta_9^{-3}) + 3(\\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) = -1 + 3\\eta$.\nThus, the minimal polynomial for $\\eta$ is $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0$.\n\nThe problem directs us to construct a unit from circular units. The circular units of $K$ are generated by elements of the form $\\varepsilon_a = \\frac{1-\\zeta_9^a}{1-\\zeta_9}$ for $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. For $a$ coprime to $n$, the ideal $(1-\\zeta_n^a)$ is the same as $(1-\\zeta_n)$, so their ratio is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nLet's choose a simple generator, taking $a=2$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_2 = \\frac{1 - \\zeta_9^2}{1 - \\zeta_9} = 1 + \\zeta_9 $$\nThis is a unit in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9)$. To obtain a unit in the real subfield $K^+$, we project $\\varepsilon_2$ from $K$ to $K^+$ by taking its norm, $N_{K/K^+}$. The non-trivial Galois automorphism of $K/K^+$ is complex conjugation, $\\sigma_{-1}: \\zeta_9 \\mapsto \\zeta_9^{-1}$.\n$$ u = N_{K/K^+}(\\varepsilon_2) = \\varepsilon_2 \\cdot \\sigma_{-1}(\\varepsilon_2) = (1 + \\zeta_9)(1 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) $$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$$ u = 1 + \\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1} + \\zeta_9 \\zeta_9^{-1} = 1 + (\\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) + 1 = 2 + (\\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) $$\nExpressed in terms of our generator $\\eta$ for $K^+$, the unit is $u = 2 + \\eta$.\n\nTo confirm $u$ is a unit, we compute its norm in $K^+/\\mathbb{Q}$: $N_{K^+/\\mathbb{Q}}(u) = N_{K^+/\\mathbb{Q}}(2+\\eta)$. This is related to the minimal polynomial $f(x)=x^3-3x+1$ of $\\eta$. The norm of an element $\\alpha - \\beta$ is $N(\\alpha - \\beta) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}} f(\\beta)$, so $N(2+\\eta) = N(\\eta - (-2)) = (-1)^3 f(-2)$.\n$$ N_{K^+/\\mathbb{Q}}(2+\\eta) = -((-2)^3 - 3(-2) + 1) = -(-8 + 6 + 1) = -(-1) = 1 $$\nSince its norm is $1$, $u=2+\\zeta_9+\\zeta_9^{-1}$ is indeed a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_{K^+}$.\n\nFinally, we must justify that this is a fundamental unit. By Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, the rank of the unit group of $K^+$ is $r_1+r_2-1$, where $r_1=3$ is the number of real embeddings and $r_2=0$ is the number of complex embeddings. The rank is $3+0-1=2$. A set of fundamental units will be a basis of two elements for the free part of the unit group.\nA major result in the theory of cyclotomic fields (Washington's theorem) states that the index of the group of circular units in the full group of units of $K^+$ is equal to the class number $h_{K^+}$ of $K^+$. For $n=9$, it is known that $h_9^+=1$. This means the circular units generate the entire unit group $\\mathcal{O}_{K^+}^\\times$. The unit $u=2+\\zeta_9+\\zeta_9^{-1}$ we constructed is one of the standard generators for the group of circular units. Therefore, it can be chosen as part of a basis for the unit group, which makes it a fundamental unit.\n\nThus, an explicit fundamental unit is $2 + \\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}$.\nThe final answer is composed of the norm and this unit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2+\\zeta_9+\\zeta_9^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3030628"}]}
