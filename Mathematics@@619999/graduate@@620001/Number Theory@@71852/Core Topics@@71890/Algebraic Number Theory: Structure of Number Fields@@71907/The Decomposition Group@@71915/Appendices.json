All provided information is factually correct and internally consistent.\n\nThe objective is to compute the order of the decomposition group $D_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ for a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_{L}$ lying above the rational prime ideal $(43)$. The field $L$ is the unique cyclic cubic subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\n\nLet $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ be a Galois extension of number fields. Let $p$ be a rational prime, and let $\\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_L$ lying above the ideal $(p) = p\\mathbb{Z}$. The decomposition group of $\\mathfrak{p}$ is defined as the subgroup of the Galois group $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ that fixes $\\mathfrak{p}$:\n$$D_{\\mathfrak{p}} = \\{ \\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\mid \\sigma(\\mathfrak{p}) = \\mathfrak{p} \\}$$\nThe order of this group, $|D_{\\mathfrak{p}}|$, is given by the product of the ramification index $e$ and the inertial degree $f$ of the prime $\\mathfrak{p}$ over $(p)$. That is, $|D_{\\mathfrak{p}}| = ef$.\n\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$. The fundamental identity relating these quantities is $gef = [L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, where $g$ is the number of distinct prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ lying above $(p)$. In our case, this is $gef = 3$.\n\nFirst, we determine the ramification index $e$. A prime $p$ is ramified in a number field $L$ if and only if $p$ divides the field discriminant $\\Delta_L$. The problem states that the discriminant of $L$ is $49 = 7^2$. The prime under consideration is $p=43$. Since $43$ does not divide $49$, the prime $(43)$ is unramified in $L$. This implies that the ramification index $e$ for any prime $\\mathfrak{p}$ above $(43)$ is $e=1$.\n\nWith $e=1$, the order of the decomposition group simplifies to $|D_{\\mathfrak{p}}| = f$, and the fundamental identity becomes $gf=3$. Since $f$ must be an integer, the possible values for $f$ are $1$ and $3$. Our task is thus reduced to determining the inertial degree $f$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, where $\\theta = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)$ has the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1$. The index $[\\mathcal{O}_L : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ is $1$. Since the prime $p=43$ does not divide this index, we can apply the Dedekind-Kummer theorem. This theorem states that the factorization of the ideal $(43)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ mirrors the factorization of the polynomial $f(x)$ in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{43}[x]$.\n\nSpecifically, if $f(x)$ factors into $g$ distinct irreducible polynomials of degree $f$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{43}[x]$, then the ideal $(43)$ splits into $g$ distinct prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_L$, each with an inertial degree of $f$. Since the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois, all inertial degrees must be the same.\n\nWe must determine the factorization of $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1$ modulo $43$. To do this, we test for roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{43}$. A root exists if and only if $f(x)$ is reducible.\nLet's test integer values for $x$ in $f(x) \\pmod{43}$:\n$f(0) = -1 \\equiv 42 \\pmod{43}$\n$f(1) = 1+1-2-1 = -1 \\equiv 42 \\pmod{43}$\n$f(2) = 8+4-4-1 = 7 \\pmod{43}$\n...\nLet's try $x=15$:\n$$f(15) = 15^3 + 15^2 - 2(15) - 1$$\n$$f(15) = 3375 + 225 - 30 - 1 = 3569$$\nTo evaluate this modulo $43$, we divide $3569$ by $43$:\n$$3569 = 43 \\times 83$$\nSo, $f(15) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$. This demonstrates that $x=15$ is a root of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{43}$.\n\nThe existence of a root proves that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_{43}$. Because $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree $3$, the polynomial $f(x) \\pmod{p}$ for an unramified prime $p$ cannot factor into a linear and an irreducible quadratic factor (which would imply non-uniform inertial degrees $f_1=1, f_2=2$). Therefore, since $f(x)$ is reducible, it must split completely into three distinct linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}_{43}[x]$. (The factors are distinct because $p=43$ does not divide the polynomial discriminant, which is equal to the field discriminant $49$).\n\nThis factorization pattern implies that the number of prime ideals above $(43)$ is $g=3$, and the degree of each factor polynomial is $1$, which means the inertial degree is $f=1$.\n\nWe can verify this by finding all roots. Having found the root $x_1=15$, we can perform polynomial division in $\\mathbb{F}_{43}[x]$ to find the remaining quadratic factor.\n$$(x-15)(x^2+ax+b) = x^3+(a-15)x^2+(b-15a)x-15b$$\nComparing coefficients with $f(x) = x^3+x^2-2x-1$:\n$a-15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43} \\implies a \\equiv 16 \\pmod{43}$.\n$-15b \\equiv -1 \\pmod{43} \\implies 15b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$. The inverse of $15$ mod $43$ is $23$ since $15 \\times 23 = 345 = 8 \\times 43 + 1$. Thus, $b \\equiv 23 \\pmod{43}$.\nLet's check the $x$ coefficient: $b-15a \\equiv 23 - 15(16) = 23 - 240$. Since $240 = 5 \\times 43 + 25$, we have $23-25 = -2$. This matches the coefficient of $x$ in $f(x)$.\nSo, $f(x) \\equiv (x-15)(x^2+16x+23) \\pmod{43}$.\nThe discriminant of the quadratic factor $x^2+16x+23$ is $\\Delta = 16^2 - 4(1)(23) = 256 - 92 = 164$. Modulo $43$, $164 = 3 \\times 43 + 35 \\equiv 35 \\pmod{43}$.\nWe find that $11^2 = 121 = 2 \\times 43 + 35$, so $\\sqrt{35} \\equiv \\pm 11 \\pmod{43}$.\nThe roots of the quadratic are given by $x = \\frac{-16 \\pm 11}{2}$. The inverse of $2$ modulo $43$ is $22$.\n$x_2 = 22(-16+11) = 22(-5) = -110 = -3 \\times 43 + 19 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{43}$.\n$x_3 = 22(-16-11) = 22(-27) \\equiv 8 \\pmod{43}$ (since $22 \\times (-27) = -594 = -14 \\times 43 + 8$).\nThe roots are $8, 15, 19$. So $f(x) \\equiv (x-8)(x-15)(x-19) \\pmod{43}$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ indeed splits into $g=3$ linear factors, confirming that the inertial degree is $f=1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the order of the decomposition group $D_{\\mathfrak{p}}$:\n$$|D_{\\mathfrak{p}}| = ef = 1 \\times 1 = 1$$\nThis means the decomposition group is the trivial subgroup of $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3025503"}, {"introduction": "Building on the unramified case, this practice delves into a more complex scenario involving a non-abelian Galois group and ramification.

The roots of $x^4-2=0$ are $\\sqrt[4]{2}$, $i\\sqrt[4]{2}$, $-\\sqrt[4]{2}$, and $-i\\sqrt[4]{2}$. The splitting field is thus $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$. The polynomial $x^4-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for $p=2$, so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, $i \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})$, so $[K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})] = 2$.

An automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its action on the generators $\\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $i$. There are $4$ choices for $\\sigma(\\sqrt[4]{2})$ (the roots of $x^4-2$) and $2$ choices for $\\sigma(i)$ (the roots of $x^2+1$). This gives $8$ automorphisms. Let's define $r$ and $s$ by:\n$r(\\sqrt[4]{2}) = i\\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $r(i) = i$.\n$s(\\sqrt[4]{2}) = \\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $s(i) = -i$.\nOne can check that $r$ has order $4$, $s$ has order $2$, and they satisfy the relation $srs^{-1}=r^{-1}$. Thus, $G$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order $8$, $D_4$.\n\nFor any prime $p$, the degree of the extension is related to the number of primes $g$ lying over $p$, the ramification index $e$, and the residue degree $f$ by the formula $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = gef$. Since $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, $e$ and $f$ are the same for all primes $\\mathfrak{P}$ lying over $p$. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = ef$. The number of distinct primes above $p$ is $g = [G:D_{\\mathfrak{P}}] = |G|/|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|$.\n\nWe now analyze each prime individually.\n\nCase $p=2$:\nThe prime $p=2$ is the one for which Eisenstein's criterion applies to $x^4-2$. The discriminant of the polynomial $x^4-2$ is $-256(2)^3 = -2^{11}$. The discriminant of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})$ is also a power of $2$. The discriminant of $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is $-4=-2^2$. This means $p=2$ is the only prime that ramifies in $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTo determine the structure of the decomposition, we consider the extension of local fields $K_{\\mathfrak{P}}/\\mathbb{Q}_2$, where $\\mathfrak{P}$ is a prime of $K$ over $2$. The degree of this local extension is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|$. The field $K_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the compositum of $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt[4]{2})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}_2(i)$.\nThe polynomial $x^4-2$ is an Eisenstein polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Thus, the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt[4]{2})/\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is a totally ramified extension of degree $4$. Its ramification index is $e_1=4$ and its residue degree is $f_1=1$.\nThe polynomial $x^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ because $-1 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, so by Hensel's lemma, $-1$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}_2(i)/\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is an unramified quadratic extension. Its ramification index is $e_2=1$ and its residue degree is $f_2=2$.\nThe compositum $K_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$ is the extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ obtained by adjoining generators for a totally ramified extension and an unramified extension. The intersection of these two extensions is $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Therefore, the ramification index of the compositum is $e = e_1=4$ and the residue degree is $f = f_2 = 2$.\nThe degree of the local extension is $[K_{\\mathfrak{P}}:\\mathbb{Q}_2]=ef = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\nThe order of the decomposition group is equal to this degree, so $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = 8$.\nFor $p=2$, we found $e=4$ and $f=2$. Since $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = 8 = |G|$, we have $g=1$. This means $2$ is totally ramified in a specific sense, as $(2)=\\mathfrak{P}^e$ is not true, but there is only one prime ideal above $2$. The values satisfy $gef=1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$. The inertia group $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ has order $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=e=4$.\n\nCase $p=3$:\nThe prime $p=3$ does not divide the discriminant of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, so it is unramified. This means $e=1$ for any prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $3$. The inertia group $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is trivial. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = f$.\nTo find $f$, we analyze the decomposition in the tower $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(i) \\subset K$.\n1. Extension $\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}$: Since $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, the prime $3$ is inert in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. So $3\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)} = \\mathfrak{p}_3$ is a prime ideal. For this sub-extension, we have $g_1=1$, $e_1=1$, $f_1=2$. The residue field $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)}/\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{3^2} = \\mathbb{F}_9$.\n2. Extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$: We consider the factorization of $x^4-2$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_9$. The field $\\mathbb{F}_9$ can be constructed as $\\mathbb{F}_3[t]/(t^2+1)$. Let $j$ be a root of $t^2+1=0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_9$, so $j^2=-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Thus, $2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{F}_9$. The polynomial becomes $x^4-2 \\equiv x^4-j^2 = (x^2-j)(x^2+j) \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}_3}$. Now we must check if $j$ and $-j$ are squares in $\\mathbb{F}_9$. The multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_9^*$ is cyclic of order $8$. An element $y$ is a square if and only if $y^{(9-1)/2}=y^4=1$. Let's check for $j$: $j^4 = (j^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$. So $j$ is a square in $\\mathbb{F}_9$. Similarly, $(-j)^4 = (-1)^4 j^4 = 1$, so $-j$ is also a square. Therefore, $x^4-2$ splits into four distinct linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_9$.\nBy the theory of Kummer extensions (or Dedekind's theorem), this implies that the prime $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ splits completely in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. For this stage, we have $g_2=4$, $e_2=1$, $f_2=1$.\nCombining the results for the full extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$:\nThe number of primes is $g=g_1 g_2 = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$.\nThe ramification index is $e=e_1 e_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThe residue degree is $f=f_1 f_2 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\nCheck: $gef=4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 8$. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = ef = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\nCase $p=5$:\nThe prime $p=5$ is also unramified, so $e=1$ and $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=1$. Again, $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=f$.\n1. Extension $\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}$: Since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the prime $5$ splits in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We have $5\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)} = \\mathfrak{p}_5 \\mathfrak{p}'_5$, for example $\\mathfrak{p}_5 = (2+i)$. For this sub-extension, we have $g_1=2$, $e_1=1$, $f_1=1$. The residue field for each prime factor is $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n2. Extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$: We consider the factorization of $x^4-2$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_5$. The polynomial is $x^4-2 \\equiv x^4+3 \\pmod 5$.\nWe check for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5$: $f(0)=3$, $f(1)=4$, $f(2)=16+3 \\equiv 4$, $f(3)=81+3 \\equiv 4$, $f(4)=(-1)^4+3=4$. There are no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\nTo check for irreducibility, we can test for roots in the extension field $\\mathbb{F}_{5^2}=\\mathbb{F}_{25}$. A root $x$ would satisfy $x^4 = -3 = 2$. This requires $2$ to be a fourth power in $\\mathbb{F}_{25}^*$. The group $\\mathbb{F}_{25}^*$ is cyclic of order $24$. An element $y$ is a fourth power if and only if $y^{24/\\gcd(4,24)} = y^6 = 1$. For $y=2$, we compute $2^6=64 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$. Since $4 \\neq 1$, $2$ is not a fourth power in $\\mathbb{F}_{25}$. Thus, $x^4+3$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{25}$. A quartic polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ that has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ must be irreducible. Hence, $x^4+3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\nThis implies that the prime $\\mathfrak{p}_5$ is inert in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. For this stage, we have $g_2=1$, $e_2=1$, $f_2=4$.\nCombining the results for the full extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$:\nThe prime $5$ splits into two primes $\\mathfrak{p}_5, \\mathfrak{p}_5'$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and each of these remains inert in the extension to $K$. So, there are $g=2$ primes above $5$ in $K$.\nFor a given prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $p=5$, the ramification index is $e = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}_5)e(\\mathfrak{p}_5/5) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThe residue degree is $f = f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}_5)f(\\mathfrak{p}_5/5) = 4 \\cdot 1 = 4$.\nCheck: $gef=2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = ef = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$.\n\nIn summary:\n- For $p=2$: $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=8$. The prime is ramified ($e=4, f=2$). The non-trivial inertia group $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=4$ signals ramification. The fact that $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=|G|$ implies $g=1$, so the prime ideal does not split.\n- For $p=3$: $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=2$. The prime is unramified ($e=1, f=2$). The triviality of $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ shows it is unramified. The order $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=2$ implies $g=|G|/|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = 8/2=4$. The prime $3$ splits into $4$ distinct primes.\n- For $p=5$: $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=4$. The prime is unramified ($e=1, f=4$). The triviality of $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ shows it is unramified. The order $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=4$ implies $g=8/4=2$. The prime $5$ splits into $2$ distinct primes.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix of these orders.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n8 & 2 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3025526"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice zooms in to the local level to reveal the rich internal structure of the decomposition group.

The residue field of $K_u$ is $\\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$. $K_u$ is the maximal unramified subextension of $L/K$.\n\nLet $K_r = K(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha^3 = 2$. The polynomial $f(X) = X^3 - 2$ is an Eisenstein polynomial with respect to the prime $p=2$ of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. By Eisenstein's criterion, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nHence, $[K_r : K] = 3$.\nSince the minimal polynomial is Eisenstein, the extension $K_r/K$ is totally ramified. The ramification index is $e(K_r/K) = 3$ and the residue field degree is $f(K_r/K) = 1$. The ramification index $e=3$ is prime to the residue characteristic $p=2$, so this is a tamely ramified extension.\n\nThe field $L = K(\\zeta_3, \\alpha)$ is the compositum of $K_u$ and $K_r$. Since their degrees over $K$ are $2$ and $3$, which are coprime, the degree of the composite extension is $[L:K] = [K_u:K][K_r:K] = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\nThe ramification index of the composite extension is $e(L/K) = e(K_u/K) \\cdot e(K_r/K) = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3$.\nThe residue field degree is $f(L/K) = f(K_u/K) \\cdot f(K_r/K) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\nAs a check, $[L:K] = e(L/K)f(L/K) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\n\nLet $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. For an extension of local fields, there is a unique prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ in the ring of integers of $L$ lying above the prime $(2)$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The decomposition group $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is defined as the subgroup of $G$ consisting of automorphisms that fix $\\mathfrak{P}$. For an extension of local fields, the Galois group acts transitively on the primes above the base prime, and since there is only one such prime, the entire Galois group must be the decomposition group. Thus, $D_{\\mathfrak{P}} = G$.\n\nWe now determine the structure of $G \\cong D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$. $G$ is a group of order $6$. There are two possibilities: the cyclic group $C_6$ or the symmetric group $S_3$.\nThe extension contains the unramified part $K_u$ and the totally ramified part $K_r$. Let's choose generators for $G$.\nLet $\\tau \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K_u)$. This is the subgroup corresponding to the fixed field $K_u$. Its order is $[L:K_u] = [K_r:K] = 3$. We can define $\\tau$ by its action on the generators: $\\tau(\\zeta_3) = \\zeta_3$ and $\\tau(\\alpha) = \\zeta_3\\alpha$. It follows that $\\tau^3 = \\mathrm{id}$.\nLet $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K_r)$. This subgroup corresponds to the fixed field $K_r$. Its order is $[L:K_r] = [K_u:K] = 2$. We can define $\\sigma$ by: $\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\alpha$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta_3) = \\zeta_3^2 = \\zeta_3^{-1}$. It follows that $\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{id}$.\nThe group $G$ is generated by $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$. To determine the structure, we find the relation between them. We compute the action of the conjugate $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}$ on the generators $\\alpha$ and $\\zeta_3$. Since $\\sigma^{-1}=\\sigma$:\n$\\sigma\\tau\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\sigma\\tau(\\alpha) = \\sigma(\\zeta_3\\alpha) = \\sigma(\\zeta_3)\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\zeta_3^{-1}\\alpha$.\n$\\sigma\\tau\\sigma(\\zeta_3) = \\sigma\\tau(\\zeta_3^{-1}) = \\sigma(\\zeta_3^{-1})$ (since $\\tau$ fixes $\\zeta_3$) $= (\\zeta_3^{-1})^{-1} = \\zeta_3$.\nMeanwhile, $\\tau^{-1}$ acts as $\\tau^{-1}(\\alpha) = \\zeta_3^{-1}\\alpha$ and $\\tau^{-1}(\\zeta_3) = \\zeta_3$.\nThe actions of $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}$ and $\\tau^{-1}$ on the generators are identical, so the automorphisms are the same: $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}$.\nThe relations $\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{id}$, $\\tau^3 = \\mathrm{id}$, and $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}$ are the defining relations for the symmetric group on $3$ elements, $S_3$. Thus, $D_{\\mathfrak{P}} = G \\cong S_3$.\n\nThe analysis of the inertia group and Frobenius element confirms this structure.\nThe inertia group $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the kernel of the surjective homomorphism from $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ to the Galois group of the residue field extension, $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{2^2}/\\mathbb{F}_2)$.\nThe order of $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the ramification index $e(L/K) = 3$. In $S_3$, the unique subgroup of order $3$ is the alternating group $A_3$. This subgroup is generated by any $3$-cycle. In our case, $I_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$.\nThe residue characteristic is $p=2$. The order of the inertia group, $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=3$, is prime to $p$. Therefore, the wild inertia subgroup is trivial, and $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the tame inertia subgroup. From the structure of Galois groups of local fields, $I_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K_u) = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, which is consistent.\n\nA lift of the Frobenius element to $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is any element in $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ whose image generates $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{2^2}/\\mathbb{F}_2)$. The quotient is $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}/I_{\\mathfrak{P}} \\cong S_3/A_3 \\cong C_2$. The non-identity coset is represented by $\\sigma$. Thus, we can take $\\sigma$ as a lift of Frobenius. The action by conjugation of this lift on the tame inertia subgroup $I_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$ is given by the relation we already derived: $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}$.\n\nThe final task is to determine the order of the commutator subgroup $[D_{\\mathfrak{P}}, D_{\\mathfrak{P}}]$. We have established that $D_{\\mathfrak{P}} \\cong S_3$. We need to find the order of $[S_3, S_3]$.\nThe commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ of a group $G$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $[g,h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ for $g,h \\in G$.\nFor $G=S_3$, let's compute the commutator of our generators $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$:\n$[\\sigma, \\tau] = \\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}\\tau^{-1} = (\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1})\\tau^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}\\tau^{-1} = \\tau^{-2} = \\tau$.\nSince $\\tau$ is an element of the commutator subgroup $[S_3, S_3]$, the entire cyclic subgroup generated by $\\tau$ must be contained in $[S_3, S_3]$. That is, $\\langle \\tau \\rangle \\subseteq [S_3, S_3]$.\nThe subgroup $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$ is isomorphic to $A_3$ and has order $3$.\nFurthermore, the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the smallest normal subgroup of $G$ such that the quotient $G/[G,G]$ (the abelianization of $G$) is abelian.\nThe quotient group $S_3/\\langle \\tau \\rangle \\cong S_3/A_3 \\cong C_2$ is abelian. By the universal property of commutator subgroups, it must be that $[S_3, S_3] \\subseteq \\langle \\tau \\rangle$.\nCombining the two inclusions, we have $[S_3, S_3] = \\langle \\tau \\rangle = A_3$.\nThe order of this subgroup is the order of $A_3$, which is $3$.\n\nTherefore, the order of the commutator subgroup $[D_{\\mathfrak{P}}, D_{\\mathfrak{P}}]$ is $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "3025522"}]}
