Otherwise, it is a complex embedding. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, the two embeddings are $\\sigma_{1}(a+b\\sqrt{d}) = a+b\\sqrt{d}$ and $\\sigma_{2}(a+b\\sqrt{d}) = a-b\\sqrt{d}$.\n\n- If $d>0$, then $\\sqrt{d}$ is a real number. For any element $x \\in K$, both $\\sigma_1(x)$ and $\\sigma_2(x)$ are real numbers. Thus, for $d>0$, the field $K$ is called a real quadratic field and has two real embeddings ($\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$).\n- If $d<0$, then $\\sqrt{d}$ is a purely imaginary number. For any $x = a+b\\sqrt{d} \\in K$ with $b \\neq 0$, the values $\\sigma_1(x)$ and $\\sigma_2(x)$ are not real. Thus, for $d<0$, the field $K$ is called an imaginary quadratic field and has zero real embeddings. It has a pair of complex conjugate embeddings ($\\sigma_{2}(x)=\\overline{\\sigma_{1}(x)}$).\n\nNow we analyze the sign of $\\Delta_{K} = (\\det(M))^2$. Let $\\{\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}\\}$ be an integral basis. The determinant is $\\det(M) = \\sigma_{1}(\\alpha_1)\\sigma_{2}(\\alpha_2) - \\sigma_{2}(\\alpha_1)\\sigma_{1}(\\alpha_2)$.\n\nCase 1: $d>0$ (Two real embeddings).\nIn this case, $\\sigma_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{2}$ are real embeddings. Since the basis elements $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}$ are in $K$, their images $\\sigma_{j}(\\alpha_{i})$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}$ are all real numbers. Consequently, the matrix $M$ is a real matrix. Its determinant, $\\det(M)$, is a real number. The discriminant is $\\Delta_{K} = (\\det(M))^2$. Since $\\det(M)$ is a non-zero real number (as the basis elements are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$), its square must be positive. Therefore, if $K$ has two real embeddings, $\\Delta_{K} > 0$. This is observed in our calculations for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ ($\\Delta_K = 8 > 0$) and $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ ($\\Delta_K=5 > 0$).\n\nCase 2: $d<0$ (Zero real embeddings).\nIn this case, the embeddings are a complex conjugate pair, $\\sigma_{2} = \\overline{\\sigma_{1}}$. Let us denote $\\sigma_1$ by $\\sigma$. Then $\\sigma_2 = \\overline{\\sigma}$. The matrix $M$ takes the form:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma(\\alpha_{1}) & \\overline{\\sigma(\\alpha_{1})} \\\\ \\sigma(\\alpha_{2}) & \\overline{\\sigma(\\alpha_{2})} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet $z_{1} = \\sigma(\\alpha_{1})$ and $z_{2} = \\sigma(\\alpha_{2})$. The determinant is $\\det(M) = z_{1}\\overline{z_{2}} - \\overline{z_{1}}z_{2}$.\nIf we write $z_{1} = u_{1} + iv_{1}$ and $z_{2} = u_{2} + iv_{2}$, then:\n$\\det(M) = (u_{1}+iv_{1})(u_{2}-iv_{2}) - (u_{1}-iv_{1})(u_{2}+iv_{2})$\n$= (u_{1}u_{2}+v_{1}v_{2} + i(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})) - (u_{1}u_{2}+v_{1}v_{2} + i(u_{1}v_{2}-u_{2}v_{1}))$\n$= 2i(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})$.\nSince $\\{\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$, the complex numbers $\\{z_{1}, z_{2}\\}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies that the term $u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2}$ is a non-zero real number. Thus, $\\det(M)$ is a non-zero purely imaginary number.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta_{K} = (\\det(M))^2 = (2i(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2}))^2 = -4(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})^2$.\nSince $(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})^2 > 0$, the discriminant $\\Delta_{K}$ must be negative. Therefore, if $K$ has zero real embeddings, $\\Delta_{K} < 0$. This is observed for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$ ($\\Delta_K=-4 < 0$) and $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ ($\\Delta_K=-3 < 0$).\n\nIn summary, the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ is determined by the number of real embeddings: it is positive if there are two real embeddings ($d>0$) and negative if there are zero real embeddings ($d<0$). This corresponds to the sign of $(-1)^{r_2}$, where $r_2$ is the number of pairs of complex embeddings.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -4 & -3 & 8 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3021882"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp on calculating the discriminant, we now turn to its most powerful application: predicting how prime numbers factor in a quadratic extension.

Expanding this, we get $4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 1 = -3$, which simplifies to $4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 4 = 0$. Dividing by $4$, we find that $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - x + 1 = 0$. Since this polynomial is monic, has integer coefficients, and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$.
