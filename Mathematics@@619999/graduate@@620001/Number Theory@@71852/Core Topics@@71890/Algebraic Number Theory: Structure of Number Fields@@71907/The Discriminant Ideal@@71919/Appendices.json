In this case, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_2) = \\mathbb{Q}(-1) = \\mathbb{Q}$. The extension is trivial, of degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 1$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}$. The discriminant is by definition $d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = 1$. The absolute discriminant is $\\lvert d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} \\rvert = 1$. The formula to be derived, $p^{p-2}$, yields $2^{2-2} = 2^0 = 1$ for $p=2$, so the formula holds.\n\nNow, let us assume $p$ is an odd prime. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\phi(p) = p-1$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_p]$.\n\nThe absolute discriminant $\\lvert d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} \\rvert$ is the absolute value of the integer generator of the discriminant ideal $d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$. The discriminant ideal is related to the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_K$ by the formula:\n$$d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathrm{Norm}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}})$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Norm}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the ideal norm map from ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ to ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTo find the discriminant, we first determine the different ideal using ramification theory. The valuation of the different ideal at a prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is given by Hilbert's formula for the different. Let $\\mathfrak{P}$ lie over a prime $q$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$. The formula is:\n$$v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (\\lvert G_i \\rvert - 1)$$\nwhere $G_i = G_i(\\mathfrak{P}|q)$ are the ramification groups of $\\mathfrak{P}$ over $q$ in the lower numbering.\n\nThe only prime that ramifies in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $p$. For any other prime $q \\neq p$, the extension is unramified at $q$. This means for any prime $\\mathfrak{q}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ lying over $q$, all ramification groups $G_i(\\mathfrak{q}|q)$ are trivial. Thus, $v_{\\mathfrak{q}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (1-1) = 0$. This implies the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is not divisible by any prime ideal other than the one(s) lying over $p$.\n\nLet's analyze the ramification of $p$ in $K$. The prime $p$ is totally ramified in $K$: the ideal $(p)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ as $(p) = \\mathfrak{p}^{p-1}$, where $\\mathfrak{p} = (1-\\zeta_p)$ is the unique prime ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ lying over $p$.\nThe ramification index is $e = e(\\mathfrak{p}|p) = p-1$.\nThe residue degree is $f = f(\\mathfrak{p}|p) = 1$.\nThe Galois group is $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $p-1$.\n\nWe now determine the ramification groups $G_i = G_i(\\mathfrak{p}|p)$.\nThe zeroth ramification group, $G_0$, is the inertia group $I(\\mathfrak{p}|p)$. Its order is the ramification index, $\\lvert G_0 \\rvert = e = p-1$.\nThe extension is tamely ramified because the residue characteristic, which is $p$, does not divide the ramification index $e = p-1$ (for $p > 2$). A key property of tamely ramified extensions is that all higher ramification groups are trivial. That is, for $i \\ge 1$, $G_i = \\{\\mathrm{id}\\}$. Consequently, $\\lvert G_i \\rvert = 1$ for all $i \\ge 1$.\n\nNow we apply Hilbert's formula to find the $\\mathfrak{p}$-adic valuation of the different ideal:\n$$v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (\\lvert G_i \\rvert - 1) = (\\lvert G_0 \\rvert - 1) + \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} (\\lvert G_i \\rvert - 1)$$\nSubstituting the orders of the ramification groups:\n$$v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = ((p-1) - 1) + \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} (1 - 1) = (p-2) + 0 = p-2$$\nThis calculation explains the origin of the exponent $p-2$. It is the valuation of the different ideal at the unique ramified prime, and it is equal to $\\lvert G_0 \\rvert - 1$, where $G_0$ is the inertia group.\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{p}$ is the only prime dividing the different, we can write the different ideal as:\n$$\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathfrak{p}^{p-2}$$\nNow we find the discriminant ideal by taking the norm:\n$$d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathrm{Norm}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = \\mathrm{Norm}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}^{p-2})$$\nUsing the multiplicative property of the ideal norm:\n$$d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = (\\mathrm{Norm}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}))^{p-2}$$\nThe norm of a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ lying over a prime $p$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is given by $\\mathrm{Norm}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}) = (p)^f$, where $f$ is the residue degree. In our case, $f=1$. So, $\\mathrm{Norm}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}) = (p)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for the discriminant ideal:\n$$d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = (p)^{p-2} = (p^{p-2})$$\nThe discriminant ideal of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}$ generated by the integer $p^{p-2}$. The absolute discriminant $\\lvert d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} \\rvert$ is the absolute value of this generator.\n$$\\lvert d_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} \\rvert = \\lvert \\pm p^{p-2} \\rvert = p^{p-2}$$\nThis result also holds for $p=2$, as shown at the beginning. Therefore, for any prime $p$, the absolute discriminant of the $p$-th cyclotomic field is $p^{p-2}$.\n\nTo summarize the explanation requested: the exponent $p-2$ arises as the valuation of the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ at the unique prime $\\mathfrak{p}$ over $p$. According to Hilbert's formula, this valuation is the sum $\\sum(\\lvert G_i \\rvert - 1)$ over the ramification filtration $\\{G_i\\}$. For the tamely ramified extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ at $p$, this sum simplifies to $\\lvert G_0 \\rvert - 1 = e - 1 = (p-1)-1 = p-2$, as all higher ramification groups are trivial. Taking the norm of the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathfrak{p}^{p-2}$ translates this exponent on the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ into the exponent on the rational prime $p$ in the absolute discriminant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p^{p-2}}$$", "id": "3025789"}, {"introduction": "The study of ramification is often clearest in the setting of local fields.

A key property of an Eisenstein polynomial of degree $n$ is that it is irreducible over $K$, and the extension $L=K(\\alpha)$ it generates, where $\\alpha$ is a root of $f(x)$, is a totally ramified extension of degree $n$.\nIn our case, the degree of the extension is $n=[L:K] = 9$. Since the extension is totally ramified, its ramification index is $e=n=9$ and its residue field degree is $f=1$.\n\nThe discrete valuation $v_L$ on $L$ is the unique extension of $v_K$. A root $\\alpha$ of an Eisenstein polynomial is a uniformizer for the extension field $L$. This means the valuation of $\\alpha$ in $L$ is $v_L(\\alpha)=1$. For any element $y \\in K$, the valuations are related by $v_L(y) = e \\cdot v_K(y) = 9 v_K(y)$. In particular, for the uniformizer $\\pi=3$ of $K$, we have $v_L(3) = 9 v_K(3) = 9 \\cdot 1 = 9$.\n\nThe problem states that the ring of integers of $L$ is $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathcal{O}_K[\\alpha]$.

Thus, we have the identity:\n$$\\text{disc}(f) = N_{L/K}(f'(\\alpha))$$\nThis gives us $v_K(d_{L/K}) = v_K(N_{L/K}(f'(\\alpha)))$.\n\nFor a totally ramified extension of local fields $L/K$ of degree $n=e$, there is a direct relationship between the valuation of the norm of an element $z \\in L$ and its valuation in $L$:\n$$v_K(N_{L/K}(z)) = v_L(z)$$\nThis follows from two facts: $v_L(N_{L/K}(z)) = v_L(\\prod_i \\sigma_i(z)) = \\sum_i v_L(\\sigma_i(z)) = n \\cdot v_L(z)$ since the unique extension of the valuation is invariant under the Galois action.

Thus, $v_K(2)=0$. Consequently, $v_L(2) = e \\cdot v_K(2) = 9 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n$$v_L((2 \\cdot 3)\\alpha) = 0 + 9 + 1 = 10$$\nThe valuations of the two terms are $26$ and $10$, which are not equal. Therefore, the valuation of their sum is the minimum of the two:\n$$v_L(f'(\\alpha)) = v_L(3^2\\alpha^8 + (2 \\cdot 3)\\alpha) = \\min(26, 10) = 10$$\nFinally, we have:\n$$v_K(d_{L/K}) = v_L(f'(\\alpha)) = 10$$\nThis result can also be understood through the lens of the different ideal, $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$.
