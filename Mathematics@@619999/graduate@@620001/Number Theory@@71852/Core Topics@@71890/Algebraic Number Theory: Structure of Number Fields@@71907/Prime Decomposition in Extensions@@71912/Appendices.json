Therefore, $13$ ramifies.\nUsing the polynomial method, we reduce $f(x)=x^2-x-3$ modulo $13$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2 - x - 3 \\pmod{13}$. The discriminant of this polynomial is $1-4(-3)=13 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$, so it has a single repeated root. The root of the derivative $2x-1$ is $x \\equiv 2^{-1} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{13}$.\nSo, $\\bar{f}(x) \\equiv (x-7)^2 \\pmod{13}$. (Check: $(x-7)^2=x^2-14x+49 \\equiv x^2-x+10 \\equiv x^2-x-3 \\pmod{13}$.)\nThus, $13\\mathcal{O}_K$ ramifies as the square of a prime ideal: $13\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}^2$.\nThe prime ideal is $\\mathfrak{p} = (13, w-7)$.\nThe number of prime factors is $r(13)=1$.\nThe ramification index is $e_1=2$ and the residue degree is $f_1=1$.\nVerification: $e_1 f_1 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nAnalysis for $p=17$:\nWe compute the Legendre symbol using quadratic reciprocity: $(\\frac{13}{17}) = (\\frac{17}{13})(-1)^{\\frac{13-1}{2}\\frac{17-1}{2}} = (\\frac{17 \\pmod{13}}{13})(-1)^{6 \\cdot 8} = (\\frac{4}{13}) = (\\frac{2^2}{13}) = 1$.\nSince $(\\frac{13}{17})=1$, the prime $17$ splits.\nUsing the polynomial method, we reduce $f(x)=x^2-x-3$ modulo $17$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2 - x - 3 \\pmod{17}$.\nWe find the roots using the quadratic formula in $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$: $x = (2^{-1})(1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4(-3)}) = 9(1 \\pm \\sqrt{13})$. We need to find the square root of $13$ modulo $17$. We check squares: $8^2=64=3 \\cdot 17 + 13 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}$. So $\\sqrt{13} \\equiv \\pm 8$.\nThe roots are $x_1 = 9(1+8) = 9(9) = 81 = 4 \\cdot 17 + 13 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}$, and $x_2 = 9(1-8) = 9(-7) = -63 = -4 \\cdot 17 + 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{17}$.\nSo, $\\bar{f}(x) \\equiv (x-5)(x-13) \\pmod{17}$.\nThus, $17\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits into two distinct prime ideals: $17\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$.\nThe ideals are $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (17, w-5)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (17, w-13)$.\nThe number of prime factors is $r(17)=2$.\nFor both ideals, $e_i=1$ and $f_i=1$.\nVerification: $e_1 f_1 + e_2 f_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nFinal Calculation:\nWe have determined the number of distinct prime factors $r(p)$ for each prime $p \\in S$:\n$r(2)=1$ (inert)\n$r(3)=2$ (split)\n$r(5)=1$ (inert)\n$r(13)=1$ (ramified)\n$r(17)=2$ (split)\n\nThe problem asks for the product $R=\\prod_{p \\in S} r(p)$.\n$R = r(2) \\cdot r(3) \\cdot r(5) \\cdot r(13) \\cdot r(17) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nThe value of $R$ is a single integer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3021225"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from a general case to the highly structured and elegant world of cyclotomic fields.
