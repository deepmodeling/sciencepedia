This polynomial factors over the integers as $x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1) = (x^2-1)(x^2+1)(x^4+1) = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)(x^4+1)$.\nThe primitive $8$-th roots of unity are those $\\zeta_8^k$ where $\\gcd(k,8)=1$, i.e., for $k \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. These are the roots of the $8$-th cyclotomic polynomial, $\\Phi_8(x)$. The other roots of $x^8-1$ are roots of $\\Phi_d(x)$ for divisors $d$ of $8$ other than $8$ (i.e., $d=1, 2, 4$). Thus, $\\Phi_8(x) = x^4+1$.\nTo show that $\\Phi_8(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_8$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we must show it is irreducible. We apply Eisenstein's criterion to the polynomial $\\Phi_8(x+1)$:\n$$ \\Phi_8(x+1) = (x+1)^4 + 1 = (x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1) + 1 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 2 $$\nWith the prime $p=2$, we observe that $2$ divides every coefficient except the leading coefficient ($1$), and $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term ($2$). Therefore, $\\Phi_8(x+1)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which implies that $\\Phi_8(x) = x^4+1$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $\\zeta_8$ is a root of the monic polynomial $x^4+1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\\zeta_8$ is an algebraic integer.\nThe degree of the field extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(\\Phi_8(x)) = 4$.

To ensure mathematical exactness, all calculations involving Bernoulli numbers are performed using rational number arithmetic. Python's `fractions.Fraction` class is employed for this purpose, as it stores numbers as pairs of arbitrary-precision integers (numerator and denominator) and automatically simplifies fractions to their lowest terms, which is a requirement for checking divisibility of the numerator.\n\n2.  **Computation of Bernoulli Numbers**: An efficient method for computing the sequence of Bernoulli numbers is required. The provided recurrence relation is implemented directly. To avoid redundant calculations inherent in a naive recursive approach, the Bernoulli numbers are computed iteratively and stored (memoized) in a list. The algorithm first identifies the maximum index $N = \\max(p-3)$ required across all test cases. It then builds a list of Bernoulli numbers $B_0, B_1, \\ldots, B_N$. The computation proceeds as follows:\n    - Initialize $B_0 = 1$.\n    - For each $m$ from $1$ to $N$, calculate $B_m$ using the recurrence. This calculation involves binomial coefficients $\\binom{m+1}{k}$, which are computed using `math.comb`, and arithmetic operations on `Fraction` objects.\n    - A known property of Bernoulli numbers, $B_m=0$ for all odd $m > 1$, is used as an optimization to bypass the summation for these indices.\n\n3.  **Regularity Verification and Data Collection**: For each prime $p$ in the test suite, the algorithm determines its regularity and collects the specified data points.\n    - For a given prime $p$, the algorithm iterates through all even integers $k$ in the specified range $2 \\leq k \\leq p-3$. Note that for $p=3$, this range is empty, and $p=3$ is vacuously regular.\n    - In each iteration, the algorithm accesses the pre-computed Bernoulli number $B_k$. Since `fractions.Fraction` maintains the number in lowest terms, the numerator is directly accessible via the `.numerator` attribute.\n    - A divisibility test, `B_k.numerator % p == 0`, is performed.\n    - If the test is true for any $k$, the prime $p$ is flagged as irregular. The algorithm maintains a count of such values of $k$ and records the smallest $k$ for which the condition holds.\n    - The boolean indicating whether $p$ divides the class number of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$ is determined by applying Kummer's criterion, which states this property is equivalent to $p$ being irregular. Thus, this boolean is the logical negation of the regularity status of $p$.\n\n4.  **Output Formatting**: The results for each prime $p$—a list containing the regularity status (boolean), the count of \"irregular\" indices (integer), the class number divisibility (boolean), and the smallest such index (integer, or $0$)—are aggregated. The final collection of results is formatted into a single string representing a list of lists, as specified by the problem.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that all calculations are mathematically sound and the resulting classification of primes is correct according to the given definitions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of determining the regularity of primes based on Bernoulli numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [3, 5, 23, 37, 59]\n\n    # Determine the maximum Bernoulli number index needed.\n    # The check for a prime p goes up to k = p-3.
