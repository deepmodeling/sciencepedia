We are tasked with deriving the criterion for a rational prime $p$ to be ramified in the extension $L/K$. This derivation will proceed by analyzing the properties of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_L$ of the field $L$.\n\nThe first step is to identify an integral primitive element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_L$ such that $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$, and to find its monic minimal polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The structure of $\\mathcal{O}_L$ depends on the value of $D$ modulo $4$.\n\nCase 1: $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\nIn this case, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{D}}{2}\\right]$. We can choose the integral primitive element to be $\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{D}}{2}$. The minimal polynomial $f(x)$ is found by taking the product of linear factors corresponding to $\\alpha$ and its Galois conjugate, $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{D}}{2}$:\n$$f(x) = \\left(x - \\frac{1+\\sqrt{D}}{2}\\right)\\left(x - \\frac{1-\\sqrt{D}}{2}\\right) = x^2 - \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{D}}{2} + \\frac{1-\\sqrt{D}}{2}\\right)x + \\left(\\frac{1-D}{4}\\right) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-D}{4}$$\nSince $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the term $\\frac{1-D}{4}$ is an integer, so $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ as required.\n\nCase 2: $D \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod{4}$\nIn this case, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{D}]$. We choose the integral primitive element $\\alpha = \\sqrt{D}$. Its conjugate is $-\\sqrt{D}$, and its minimal polynomial $f(x)$ is:\n$$f(x) = (x - \\sqrt{D})(x + \\sqrt{D}) = x^2 - D$$\nThis polynomial clearly has integer coefficients, $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\nThe second step is to relate the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$, denoted $\\text{disc}(f)$, to the field discriminant $\\Delta_L$. The field discriminant $\\Delta_L$ is, by definition, the discriminant of an integral basis of $\\mathcal{O}_L$. The discriminant of the basis $\\{1, \\alpha\\}$ is given by $\\text{disc}(1, \\alpha) = ([\\mathcal{O}_L : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]])^2 \\Delta_L$. In both cases above, we chose $\\alpha$ such that $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$, which means the index $[\\mathcal{O}_L : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ is equal to $1$. The discriminant of the basis $\\{1, \\alpha\\}$ is also equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, so we have $\\text{disc}(f) = \\Delta_L$. We now compute this value for each case.\n\nCase 1: $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{D}}{2}$ and $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{D}}{2}$.\n$$\\Delta_L = \\text{disc}(f) = \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{D}}{2} - \\frac{1-\\sqrt{D}}{2}\\right)^2 = (\\sqrt{D})^2 = D$$\n\nCase 2: $D \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are $\\sqrt{D}$ and $-\\sqrt{D}$.\n$$\\Delta_L = \\text{disc}(f) = (\\sqrt{D} - (-\\sqrt{D}))^2 = (2\\sqrt{D})^2 = 4D$$\n\nThe third step explains the connection between ramification and the properties of $f(x)$ modulo a prime $p$. A prime $p$ is said to be ramified in $L$ if its ideal factorization in $\\mathcal{O}_L$, $p\\mathcal{O}_L = \\prod_{i=1}^{g} \\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$, has at least one exponent $e_i > 1$. Dedekind's factorization criterion states how the factorization of $p\\mathcal{O}_L$ relates to the factorization of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $p$. A crucial part of this criterion applies here because the index $[\\mathcal{O}_L : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]] = 1$ is not divisible by any prime $p$.\n\nThe correspondence is established through the ring isomorphism:\n$$\\mathcal{O}_L / p\\mathcal{O}_L \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha] / p\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(f(x))) / (p, f(x)) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})[x]/(\\bar{f}(x))$$\nwhere $\\bar{f}(x)$ is the polynomial $f(x)$ with coefficients reduced modulo $p$.\nThe structure of the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_L/p\\mathcal{O}_L$ determines the factorization of $p\\mathcal{O}_L$. Ramification (an exponent $e_i>1$) corresponds to the presence of nilpotent elements in this ring. On the other side of the isomorphism, this corresponds to the polynomial $\\bar{f}(x)$ having repeated irreducible factors in $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})[x]$. A polynomial over a field has a repeated factor if and only if its discriminant is zero.\n\nThe discriminant of $\\bar{f}(x)$ in the field $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is the discriminant of $f(x)$ reduced modulo $p$.\n$$\\text{disc}(\\bar{f}) = \\text{disc}(f) \\pmod{p}$$\nCombining this with our earlier finding that $\\text{disc}(f) = \\Delta_L$, we have:\n$$\\text{disc}(\\bar{f}) = \\Delta_L \\pmod{p}$$\nTherefore, the prime $p$ is ramified if and only if $\\text{disc}(\\bar{f}) = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, which is equivalent to $\\Delta_L \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. This means that $p$ must be a prime divisor of the integer $\\Delta_L$. This completes the derivation of the criterion.\n\nFinally, we compute the ramification index $e$ and inertia degree $f$ for a ramified prime $p$. The fundamental identity for a number field extension of degree $n$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{g} e_i f_i = n$. For our quadratic extension $L/K$, the degree is $n = [L:K] = 2$. So, for any prime $p$, we have:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{g} e_i f_i = 2$$\nIf $p$ is ramified, at least one $e_i$ must be greater than $1$. Since all $e_i$ and $f_i$ are positive integers, the only possibility to satisfy the equation is that there is only one prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ lying over $p$ (i.e., $g=1$), and for this ideal, the ramification index is $e_1=2$ and the inertia degree is $f_1=1$.\nThus, in the ramified case, the factorization is $p\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathfrak{p}^2$.\n\nThe ramification index is $e=2$.\nThe inertia degree is $f=1$.\nThe pair $(e,f)$ is $(2,1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3022145"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic theory of ramification, we can develop a comprehensive and practical tool for predicting the behavior of any odd prime in a quadratic field.

Let $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $\\mathcal{O}_L$ be their respective rings of integers. The maximal ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\mathfrak{p} = p\\mathbb{Z}_p$, and the maximal ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_L$ is $\\mathfrak{P}$. The residue fields are $k_K = \\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p} \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p$ and $k_L = \\mathcal{O}_L/\\mathfrak{P}$.\n\nThe ramification index $e$ is the integer such that $\\mathfrak{p}\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathfrak{P}^e$. The inertia degree $f$ is the degree of the residue field extension, $f = [k_L : k_K]$. For any finite extension of local fields, the degree of the extension is given by $[L:K] = ef$.\n\nFirst, we determine the ramification index $e$. The extension $L/K$ is obtained by adjoining $\\zeta_n$, a root of the polynomial $x^n - 1$. The minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_n$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, let's call it $\\Phi(x)$, must divide $x^n - 1$. The coefficients of $\\Phi(x)$ are in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Let us consider the reduction of these polynomials modulo $p$. Let $\\bar{\\Phi}(x)$ be the reduction of $\\Phi(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. Then $\\bar{\\Phi}(x)$ divides $x^n - 1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$.\n\nThe derivative of $x^n-1$ is $nx^{n-1}$. Since we are given that $\\gcd(n,p)=1$, $n$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Thus, $nx^{n-1}$ is not the zero polynomial. The only root of $nx^{n-1}$ in an algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is $0$, but $0$ is not a root of $x^n-1$. Therefore, $x^n-1$ and its derivative are coprime in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, which means $x^n-1$ is a separable polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. As $\\bar{\\Phi}(x)$ is a factor of a separable polynomial, it too must be separable.\n\nA standard result in the theory of local fields states that an extension $K(\\alpha)/K$ obtained by adjoining an algebraic integer $\\alpha$ is unramified if the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is separable over the residue field $k_K$. Here, $\\zeta_n$ is an algebraic integer, and we have shown its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ becomes a separable polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Thus, the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\zeta_n)/\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is unramified. By definition, an unramified extension has a ramification index of $e=1$.\n\nNow we determine the inertia degree $f$. Since $e=1$, the degree of the extension is equal to the inertia degree: $f = [\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\zeta_n):\\mathbb{Q}_p]$. The extension is a Galois extension. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\zeta_n)/\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms of the residue field extension $k_L/\\mathbb{F}_p$. This latter group is cyclic and generated by the Frobenius map $\\phi: x \\mapsto x^p$. This Frobenius map on residue fields lifts to a unique automorphism in $G$, the Frobenius automorphism, which we will denote by $\\text{Frob}_p$.\n\nThe action of any automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its effect on the generator $\\zeta_n$, so $\\sigma(\\zeta_n) = \\zeta_n^k$ for some integer $k$ with $\\gcd(k,n)=1$. The Frobenius automorphism corresponds to the specific action $\\text{Frob}_p(\\zeta_n) = \\zeta_n^p$. The Galois group $G$ is generated by this automorphism.\n\nThe degree of the extension, $f$, is the order of the Galois group $G$, which is the order of its generator $\\text{Frob}_p$. The order of $\\text{Frob}_p$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $(\\text{Frob}_p)^k$ is the identity automorphism. This requires $(\\text{Frob}_p)^k(\\zeta_n) = \\zeta_n$, which translates to $\\zeta_n^{(p^k)} = \\zeta_n$. Since $\\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity, this is equivalent to the condition $p^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.\n\nTherefore, the inertia degree $f$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying $p^f \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. This is precisely the definition of the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $n$, denoted as $\\text{ord}_n(p)$.\nIn summary, for $\\gcd(n,p)=1$, we have $e=1$ and $f = \\text{ord}_n(p)$.\n\nNext, we specialize to the case $n=132$ and $p=5$.\nFirst, we check the condition: $132 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 11$. Since $5$ is not a factor of $132$, $\\gcd(132, 5) = 1$. The condition holds.\nFrom the general result, the ramification index is $e=1$.\nThe inertia degree is $f = \\text{ord}_{132}(5)$. To calculate this, we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The congruence $5^f \\equiv 1 \\pmod{132}$ is equivalent to the system:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n5^f \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\n5^f \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n5^f \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe find the order of $5$ modulo each factor:\n1. Modulo $4$: $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so $5^f \\equiv 1^f \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ for any $f \\ge 1$. The order is $\\text{ord}_4(5)=1$.\n2. Modulo $3$: $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. We have $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The order is $\\text{ord}_3(5)=2$.\n3. Modulo $11$: We compute powers of $5$: $5^1 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$, $5^3 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 4$, $5^4 \\equiv 20 \\equiv 9$, $5^5 \\equiv 45 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The order is $\\text{ord}_{11}(5)=5$.\n\nThe overall order $f$ is the least common multiple of these individual orders:\n$f = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}_4(5), \\text{ord}_3(5), \\text{ord}_{11}(5)) = \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 5) = 10$.\nThus, for $n=132$ and $p=5$, the ramification index is $e=1$ and the inertia degree is $f=10$. The pair is $(e,f)=(1,10)$.\n\nFinally, we explain the connection to the global extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{132})/\\mathbb{Q}$. In algebraic number theory, there is a fundamental link between the decomposition of a prime ideal in a global number field and the properties of the corresponding extension of local fields.\nLet $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$ and $L_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{132})$. Let $\\mathcal{O}_{L_g} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_{132}]$ be the ring of integers of $L_g$. The prime ideal $(5) = 5\\mathbb{Z}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$ decomposes in $\\mathcal{O}_{L_g}$ as a product of prime ideals:\n$$ (5) = \\mathfrak{P}_1^{e_g} \\mathfrak{P}_2^{e_g} \\cdots \\mathfrak{P}_g^{e_g} $$\nHere, $e_g$ is the ramification index and $f_g$ is the inertia degree of these primes, defined as $f_g = [\\mathcal{O}_{L_g}/\\mathfrak{P}_i : \\mathbb{Z}/(5)]$. For a Galois extension like this, all prime factors share the same $e_g$ and $f_g$. The number of distinct prime factors is $g$. These quantities are related by the degree of the global extension:\n$$ [L_g:K_g] = \\phi(132) = \\phi(4)\\phi(3)\\phi(11) = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10 = 40 = g \\cdot e_g \\cdot f_g $$\nThe crucial connection is that the local invariants $(e,f)$ for the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_5(\\zeta_{132})/\\mathbb{Q}_5$ are identical to the global invariants $(e_g, f_g)$ for any prime $\\mathfrak{P}_i$ lying above $(5)$. That is, $e = e_g$ and $f = f_g$.\nOur local calculation gives $e=1$ and $f=10$. This implies $e_g=1$ and $f_g=10$.\nWe can confirm this from first principles for the global field.\n1. Ramification: A prime $p$ ramifies in the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ if and only if $p$ divides $n$. Since $5 \\nmid 132$, the prime $5$ is unramified in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{132})$. This means $e_g=1$.\n2. Inertia: By the Dedekind-Kummer theorem, the way the ideal $(p)$ splits is determined by the factorization of the minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_n$, the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_n(x)$, over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Since $p$ is unramified, $\\Phi_n(x)$ factors into $g$ distinct irreducible polynomials, all of the same degree $f_g$. The splitting field for any of these irreducible factors over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is the smallest field extension $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{f_g}}$ that contains the $n$-th roots of unity. The multiplicative group of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{f_g}}$ is cyclic of order $p^{f_g}-1$. For this field to contain a primitive $n$-th root of unity, we must have $n | (p^{f_g}-1)$, which is $p^{f_g} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. The degree $f_g$ is the smallest such positive integer. This is precisely the definition of the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $n$.\nFor our case, $f_g = \\text{ord}_{132}(5) = 10$.\nSo the global analysis confirms $e_g=1$ and $f_g=10$. The local field calculation $(e,f)=(1,10)$ directly reflects this behavior. Using the degree formula $g \\cdot e_g \\cdot f_g = 40$, we find $g \\cdot 1 \\cdot 10 = 40$, which implies $g=4$. This means the ideal $(5)$ splits into $4$ distinct prime ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_{132}]$, each with an inertia degree of $10$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 10 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3022154"}]}
