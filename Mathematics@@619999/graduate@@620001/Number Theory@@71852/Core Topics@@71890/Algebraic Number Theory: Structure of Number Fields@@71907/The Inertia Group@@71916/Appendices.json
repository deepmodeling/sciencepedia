Trivial inertia at $\\mathfrak{P}$ means $I(\\mathfrak{P})$ is the trivial group, containing only the identity element.\n\nWe now derive the criterion for trivial inertia.\nThe problem provides two foundational facts:\n1. The different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$ of the extension $L/K$ is an ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{L}$. A prime $\\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_K$ ramifies in $L/K$ if and only if there exists a prime $\\mathfrak{P} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_L$ lying above $\\mathfrak{p}$ such that $\\mathfrak{P}$ divides $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$.\n2. The relative discriminant $\\Delta_{L/K}$ is an ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ defined as the norm of the different: $\\Delta_{L/K} = \\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K})$.\n\nA prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ is said to be unramified in $L$ if the ramification index $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$ is equal to $1$ for all primes $\\mathfrak{P}$ lying above $\\mathfrak{p}$. If the extension is Galois, the ramification indices for all primes $\\mathfrak{P}$ above a given $\\mathfrak{p}$ are equal, so we can speak of the ramification index $e_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ of $\\mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified if and only if $e_{\\mathfrak{p}} = 1$.\n\nA fundamental theorem connecting the different to ramification states that for any prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_L$ lying over $\\mathfrak{p}$, the exponent of $\\mathfrak{P}$ in the prime factorization of the different, $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K})$, satisfies $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}) \\geq e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) - 1$. Crucially, $\\mathfrak{P}$ is unramified, i.e., $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})=1$, if and only if $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K})=0$. This is equivalent to saying $\\mathfrak{P}$ does not divide $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$.\n\nCombining this with the first foundational fact, $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified if and only if no prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$ divides $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$.\n\nNow we relate this to the discriminant $\\Delta_{L/K}$. The norm of an ideal is multiplicative. Let the prime factorization of the different in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ be $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K} = \\prod_{i} \\mathfrak{P}_i^{a_i}$. Then the discriminant is\n$$ \\Delta_{L/K} = \\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}) = \\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}\\left(\\prod_{i} \\mathfrak{P}_i^{a_i}\\right) = \\prod_{i} \\left(\\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{P}_i)\\right)^{a_i} $$\nLet $\\mathfrak{p}_i = \\mathfrak{P}_i \\cap \\mathcal{O}_K$. By definition of the norm of a prime ideal, $\\operatorname{Norm}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{P}_i) = \\mathfrak{p}_i^{f(\\mathfrak{P}_i/\\mathfrak{p}_i)}$.\nA prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ divides $\\Delta_{L/K}$ if and only if there is a prime factor $\\mathfrak{p}_i$ in the factorization of $\\Delta_{L/K}$ with $\\mathfrak{p}_i = \\mathfrak{p}$. This occurs if and only if there is some prime factor $\\mathfrak{P}_i$ of $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$ such that $\\mathfrak{P}_i$ lies over $\\mathfrak{p}$.\nTherefore, we have the following chain of equivalences:\n$\\mathfrak{p}$ divides $\\Delta_{L/K}$ $\\iff$ there exists $\\mathfrak{P} \\mid \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $\\mathfrak{P}$ divides $\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}$ $\\iff$ there exists $\\mathfrak{P} \\mid \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $v_{\\mathfrak{P}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}) > 0$ $\\iff$ there exists $\\mathfrak{P} \\mid \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) > 1$ $\\iff$ $\\mathfrak{p}$ ramifies in $L/K$.\nConsequently, $\\mathfrak{p}$ does not divide $\\Delta_{L/K}$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified, meaning $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) = 1$ for all $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$.\n\nNext, we explain why $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$ for a Galois extension. The homomorphism $\\phi: D(\\mathfrak{P}) \\to \\operatorname{Gal}((\\mathcal{O}_{L}/\\mathfrak{P})/(\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{p}))$ is surjective. Its kernel is $I(\\mathfrak{P})$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have:\n$$ D(\\mathfrak{P})/I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\cong \\operatorname{Gal}((\\mathcal{O}_{L}/\\mathfrak{P})/(\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{p})) $$\nThe order of the Galois group of the residue field extension is the degree of this extension, which is the residue degree $f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$. Thus, $\\lvert D(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert / \\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$.\nFor a Galois extension, it is a fundamental result that the order of the decomposition group is $\\lvert D(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})}{\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert} = f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) $$\nwhich simplifies to $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$.\n\nFinally, we conclude that trivial inertia at $\\mathfrak{P}$ is equivalent to $\\mathfrak{p}$ not dividing $\\Delta_{L/K}$.\nTrivial inertia at $\\mathfrak{P}$ means $I(\\mathfrak{P}) = \\{1_{\\text{id}}\\}$, which is equivalent to $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = 1$.\nFrom the relation just derived, $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = 1$ is equivalent to $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}) = 1$.\nSince the extension is Galois, $e(\\mathfrak{P}'/\\mathfrak{p}) = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})$ for any other prime $\\mathfrak{P}'$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$. So, $e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})=1$ means that $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified.\nAs established earlier, $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified if and only if $\\mathfrak{p}$ does not divide the relative discriminant $\\Delta_{L/K}$.\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we verify this criterion for $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{21})$ over $K=\\mathbb{Q}$ and the prime $p=5$.\nThis is a quadratic extension of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=21$. Since $d$ is square-free and $21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{L} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{21}}{2}]$, and the absolute discriminant is $\\Delta_{L/\\mathbb{Q}} = d = 21$.\nThe principal ideal generated by the discriminant in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}$ is $(21)$. The prime factors of this ideal are $(3)$ and $(7)$.\nAccording to our criterion, a rational prime $p$ ramifies in $L$ if and only if its corresponding ideal $(p)$ divides the discriminant ideal $(21)$, which means $p$ must be $3$ or $7$. All other primes are unramified.\n\nWe are asked to consider the prime $p=5$. Since $5$ does not divide $21$, the prime $(5)$ is unramified in $L$. This means the ramification index $e(\\mathfrak{P}/(5))$ must be $1$ for any prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ lying above $(5)$.\nThe problem asks for the order of the inertia group, $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert$. Using the established relation for Galois extensions:\n$$ \\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e(\\mathfrak{P}/(5)) $$\nSince $(5)$ is unramified, we have $e(\\mathfrak{P}/(5)) = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = 1$.\nThis verifies the criterion: the prime $p=5$ does not divide the discriminant $\\Delta_{L/\\mathbb{Q}} = 21$, and the corresponding inertia subgroup is indeed trivial, having order $1$.\n\nTo be explicit, we can check the behavior of the prime $5$ using the Legendre symbol. For a prime $p$ not dividing $2d$, its behavior in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is determined by $(\\frac{d}{p})$.\nHere, $d=21$ and $p=5$. We compute the Legendre symbol:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{21}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{21 \\pmod 5}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 1 $$\nSince the symbol is $1$, the prime $5$ splits in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{21})$. This means the ideal $(5)\\mathcal{O}_L$ factors into two distinct prime ideals, $(5) = \\mathfrak{P}_1 \\mathfrak{P}_2$. The number of primes above $(5)$ is $g=2$. For a Galois extension, we have the relation $efg = [L:K] = 2$. With $g=2$, we have $e \\cdot f \\cdot 2 = 2$, which implies $ef=1$. Since $e$ and $f$ are positive integers, this requires $e=1$ and $f=1$.\nThe ramification index is $e=1$, which confirms our previous conclusion. The order of the inertia group for any prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $(5)$ is $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert = e = 1$.\nThe final answer is the integer value of $\\lvert I(\\mathfrak{P}) \\rvert$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3027273"}, {"introduction": "Moving from whether ramification occurs to *how* it occurs, we now explore the finer structure of the inertia group through its filtration by higher ramification groups.

Since the degree $n$ is coprime to the residue characteristic $p$, this is a a tamely ramified extension.\n\nTo find the ramification breaks, we must compute the valuation $v_{L_{1}}(\\gamma(\\pi_{1})-\\pi_{1})$ for any non-identity element $\\gamma \\in G$.

We compute the valuation:\n$$v_{L_{1}}(\\sigma^{k}(\\pi_{1})-\\pi_{1}) = v_{L_{1}}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}\\pi_{1}-\\pi_{1}) = v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1))$$\nUsing the properties of valuations, this is:\n$$v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1)) = v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1}) + v_{L_{1}}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1)$$\nWe have $v_{L_{1}}(\\pi_{1})=1$. The element $\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1$ is in the base field $K$, so $v_{L_{1}}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1) = n \\cdot v_{K}(\\zeta_{n}^{k}-1)$.\n\nThe problem states as a fact that $v_{K}(\\zeta_{n}-1)=0$ because $\\gcd(n,p)=1$.

For $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$, we have the identity $\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1 = (\\zeta_{p}-1)(1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1})$.\nThe valuation is $v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1) = v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}-1) + v_{K}(1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1})$.\nGiven $v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}-1) > 0$, we have $\\zeta_{p} \\equiv 1$ modulo the maximal ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Thus, the sum $1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1}$ is congruent to $k$ modulo the maximal ideal. Since $k$ is not a multiple of $p$, $v_K(k)=0$ and $k$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Therefore, $v_{K}(1+\\zeta_{p}+\\dots+\\zeta_{p}^{k-1})=0$.\nThis implies $v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}^{k}-1) = v_{K}(\\zeta_{p}-1) = \\frac{1}{p-1}$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our calculation:\n$$v_{L_{2}}(\\tau^{k}(\\pi_{2})-\\pi_{2}) = 1 + p \\cdot \\frac{1}{p-1} = \\frac{p-1+p}{p-1} = \\frac{2p-1}{p-1}$$\nThis value is constant for all non-identity elements of $H$. Let $v = \\frac{2p-1}{p-1}$.\n\nNow we determine the ramification groups $H_{i} = \\{\\gamma \\in H : v_{L_{2}}(\\gamma(\\pi_{2})-\\pi_{2}) \\geq i+1\\}$.\nA non-identity element $\\gamma$ is in $H_{i}$ if and only if $v \\geq i+1$.\n$$v = \\frac{2p-1}{p-1} = \\frac{2(p-1)+1}{p-1} = 2 + \\frac{1}{p-1}$$\nThe condition is $2 + \\frac{1}{p-1} \\geq i+1$, which is equivalent to $i \\leq 1 + \\frac{1}{p-1}$.\nSince $p \\geq 3$ is a prime, $p-1 \\geq 2$, so $0  \\frac{1}{p-1} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- For $i=0$: $0 \\leq 1+\\frac{1}{p-1}$ is true.

This contradicts $p \\geq 3$. Thus, for $i \\geq 2$, no non-identity element satisfies the condition, so $H_{i}=\\{1\\}$.\n\nThe chain of ramification subgroups is $H = H_{0} = H_{1} \\supsetneq H_{2} = \\{1\\}$.\nThe ramification break occurs at an integer $b$ where $H_{b} \\supsetneq H_{b+1}$.\n- For $b=0$: We have $H_{0}=H_{1}=H$, so $b=0$ is not a break point.\n- For $b=1$: We have $H_{1}=H$ and $H_{2}=\\{1\\}$, so $H_{1} \\supsetneq H_{2}$.

This challenging practice [@problem_id:3027247] dispels that notion by investigating a non-abelian extension of the $2$-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. By constructing the Galois group and analyzing its properties, you will demonstrate that inertia groups can indeed be non-cyclic, highlighting the rich and complex structures that can arise in ramification theory.", "problem": "Let $F=\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$ be the field of $2$-adic numbers with the normalized discrete valuation $v$ satisfying $v(2)=1$. Consider the polynomial $f(x)=x^{8}-2 \\in F[x]$ and let $K$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$. Let $G=\\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)$ be the Galois group of $K$ over $F$. Let $I_{v}\\subseteq G$ be the inertia group associated to the unique extension of $v$ to $K$, and let $P_{v}\\subseteq I_{v}$ be the wild inertia subgroup (the unique maximal pro-$p$-subgroup of $I_{v}$, where $p=2$ is the residue characteristic of $F$).\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions of ramification, inertia, and wild inertia in finite Galois extensions of local fields, and from well-tested facts about Eisenstein polynomials and cyclotomic extensions of local fields, do the following:\n\n1.

Compute the exact value of $\\lvert I_{v}\\rvert$.\n\nYour final answer must be the single integer $\\lvert I_{v}\\rvert$, with no additional text. No rounding is needed.", "solution": "Let $F=\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. The roots of $f(x)=x^{8}-2$ are of the form $\\zeta_{8}^{k} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$ for $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, 7\\}$, where $2^{1/8}$ is a fixed eighth root of $2$ and $\\zeta_{8}$ is a primitive eighth root of unity. The splitting field $K$ must therefore contain both $2^{1/8}$ and the ratio of roots $\\zeta_8$. Thus, $K=F(2^{1/8}, \\zeta_{8})$.\n\n**1. Total Ramification and Wild Inertia**\n\nWe analyze the two intermediate extensions that generate $K$:\n-   $E_{1} = F(2^{1/8})/F$: The polynomial $x^{8}-2$ is an Eisenstein polynomial over $F=\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$ because its coefficients are in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, all non-leading coefficients are divisible by $2$ (they are $0$), and the constant term $-2$ is exactly divisible by $2$ (i.e., $v_2(-2)=1$). An extension generated by a root of an Eisenstein polynomial is totally ramified. Thus, $[E_{1}:F]=8$ and the ramification index is $e(E_{1}/F)=8$. The residue field degree is $f(E_{1}/F)=1$.\n-   $E_{2} = F(\\zeta_{8})/F$: The element $\\zeta_{8}$ is a root of the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_{8}(x) = x^{4}+1$. Let $y=\\zeta_8-1$. Then $\\zeta_8=y+1$, so $(y+1)^4+1=0$, which expands to $y^4+4y^3+6y^2+4y+2=0$. This polynomial in $y$ is Eisenstein over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ ($v_2(2)=1$, $v_2(4)=2$, $v_2(6)=1$, $v_2(4)=2$). Thus, the extension $F(y)=F(\\zeta_8)$ is totally ramified of degree 4. So $[E_{2}:F]=4$ and $e(E_{2}/F)=4$, $f(E_{2}/F)=1$.\n\nThe compositum $K=E_1E_2$ is an extension whose residue field is the compositum of the residue fields of $E_1$ and $E_2$. Since both have residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (the same as $F$), the residue field of $K$ is also $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This means the residue field degree $f(K/F)=1$. For any extension of local fields, $[K:F] = e(K/F)f(K/F)$. Since $f(K/F)=1$, the extension is totally ramified.\n\nFor any totally ramified Galois extension of local fields, the inertia group $I_v$ is the entire Galois group $G$. The wild inertia subgroup $P_v$ is the Sylow $p$-subgroup of $I_v$. Here, the residue characteristic is $p=2$. The degree of the extension is $[K:F]=\\frac{[E_1:F][E_2:F]}{[E_1\\cap E_2:F]}$. The intersection $E_1 \\cap E_2$ contains $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{2})$ since $(2^{1/8})^4 = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\zeta_8+\\zeta_8^{-1}=\\sqrt{2}$. This is a degree 2 extension, and it can be shown to be the full intersection. Thus, $[K:F] = \\frac{8 \\cdot 4}{2} = 16$.\nSince $|I_v| = |G| = 16 = 2^4$, the inertia group is a $2$-group. Therefore, its Sylow $2$-subgroup is itself, so $P_v = I_v = G$. As $|P_v|=16$, we have $P_v \\neq \\{1\\}$.\n\n**2. Non-Cyclic Structure of the Inertia Group**\n\nSince $I_v=G$, we must show $G$ is not cyclic. We can do this by showing it is not abelian. An automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its action on the generators $2^{1/8}$ and $\\zeta_{8}$.\n$$ \\sigma(2^{1/8}) = \\zeta_{8}^{i} 2^{1/8} \\quad \\text{for some } i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z} $$\n$$ \\sigma(\\zeta_{8}) = \\zeta_{8}^{j} \\quad \\text{for some } j \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{*} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\} $$\nThe action must be consistent on the intersection subfield $F(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$\\sigma(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sigma((2^{1/8})^4) = (\\zeta_8^i 2^{1/8})^4 = \\zeta_8^{4i} (2^{1/8})^4 = (-1)^i \\sqrt{2}$.\nAlso, $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sigma(\\zeta_8+\\zeta_8^{-1}) = \\zeta_8^j + \\zeta_8^{-j}$. The second term is $\\sqrt{2}$ if $j \\in \\{1,7\\}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$ if $j \\in \\{3,5\\}$.\nThis imposes the constraint: $i$ must be even if $j \\in \\{1,7\\}$, and $i$ must be odd if $j \\in \\{3,5\\}$.\n\nLet's define two automorphisms that satisfy this constraint and check if they commute.\n-   Let $\\tau$ be defined by $i=1, j=3$. So $\\tau(2^{1/8}) = \\zeta_{8} 2^{1/8}$ and $\\tau(\\zeta_{8}) = \\zeta_{8}^{3}$. This is a valid automorphism since $i=1$ is odd and $j=3$.\n-   Let $\\sigma$ be defined by $i=2, j=1$. So $\\sigma(2^{1/8}) = \\zeta_{8}^{2} 2^{1/8}$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta_{8}) = \\zeta_{8}$. This is a valid automorphism since $i=2$ is even and $j=1$.\n\nNow, let's test commutation by applying the compositions to $2^{1/8}$:\n$$ (\\sigma\\tau)(2^{1/8}) = \\sigma(\\tau(2^{1/8})) = \\sigma(\\zeta_{8} 2^{1/8}) = \\sigma(\\zeta_{8})\\sigma(2^{1/8}) = \\zeta_{8} \\cdot (\\zeta_{8}^{2} 2^{1/8}) = \\zeta_{8}^{3} 2^{1/8} $$\n$$ (\\tau\\sigma)(2^{1/8}) = \\tau(\\sigma(2^{1/8})) = \\tau(\\zeta_{8}^{2} 2^{1/8}) = \\tau(\\zeta_{8})^{2}\\tau(2^{1/8}) = (\\zeta_{8}^{3})^{2} \\cdot (\\zeta_{8} 2^{1/8}) = \\zeta_{8}^{6} \\cdot \\zeta_{8} 2^{1/8} = \\zeta_{8}^{7} 2^{1/8} $$\nSince $\\zeta_{8}^{3} 2^{1/8} \\neq \\zeta_{8}^{7} 2^{1/8}$, we have $\\sigma\\tau \\neq \\tau\\sigma$. The group $G$ is non-abelian, and therefore not cyclic. Since $I_v=G$, the inertia group is not cyclic.\n\n**3. Order of the Inertia Group**\n\nAs established in part 1, the extension $K/F$ is totally ramified. For a finite Galois extension of local fields, this implies that the inertia group is the entire Galois group, $I_v = G$. The order of the inertia group is therefore the degree of the field extension.\n$$ \\lvert I_{v} \\rvert = \\lvert G \\rvert = [K:F] $$\nWe computed this degree in part 1:\n$$ [K:F] = \\frac{[F(2^{1/8}):F] \\cdot [F(\\zeta_{8}):F]}{[F(2^{1/8}) \\cap F(\\zeta_{8}):F]} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 4}{2} = 16 $$\nThe order of the inertia group is 16.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "3027247"}]}
