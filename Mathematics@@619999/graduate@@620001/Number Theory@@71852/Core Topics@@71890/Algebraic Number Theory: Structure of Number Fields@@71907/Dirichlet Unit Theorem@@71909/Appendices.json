It provides a complete and consistent set of foundational facts from which the required quantities can be derived.\n\nLet $K$ be a real quadratic field. By Dirichlet's unit theorem, the rank of the group of units $\\mathcal{O}_{K}^{\\times}$ is $r_1+r_2-1$, where $r_1=2$ is the number of real embeddings and $r_2=0$ is the number of pairs of complex embeddings. Thus, the rank is $2+0-1=1$. This means $\\mathcal{O}_{K}^{\\times} \\cong \\{\\pm 1\\} \\times \\langle \\varepsilon_K \\rangle$, where $\\varepsilon_K$ is the fundamental unit, which we can uniquely choose to be greater than $1$.\n\nThe two real embeddings are $\\sigma_1(x) = x$ and $\\sigma_2(a+b\\sqrt{d}) = a-b\\sqrt{d}$. The logarithmic embedding is the map $L: \\mathcal{O}_{K}^{\\times} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ given by $L(\\alpha) = (\\ln|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)|, \\ln|\\sigma_2(\\alpha)|)$. For a unit $\\alpha$, its norm is $N(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha)\\sigma_2(\\alpha) = \\pm 1$. Therefore, $\\ln|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)| + \\ln|\\sigma_2(\\alpha)| = \\ln|N(\\alpha)| = \\ln(1) = 0$. The image of the units forms a lattice of rank $1$ on the hyperplane $x_1+x_2=0$.\n\nThe regulator $R_K$ is the covolume of this lattice. For a rank $1$ group, it is the length of a generator of the lattice. This generator is $L(\\varepsilon_K) = (\\ln|\\sigma_1(\\varepsilon_K)|, \\ln|\\sigma_2(\\varepsilon_K)|)$. By convention, the regulator is defined as the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the log-embeddings of the fundamental units, with one column removed. In this case, this is simply $R_K=|\\ln|\\sigma_1(\\varepsilon_K)|| = |\\ln(\\varepsilon_K)|$. Since we choose $\\varepsilon_K > 1$, its logarithm is positive. Therefore, the regulator is given by the simple formula $R_K = \\ln(\\varepsilon_K)$.\n\nThe task is thus reduced to finding the fundamental unit $\\varepsilon_K > 1$ for each specified field.\n\nCase 1: $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$\n\nFor $d=2$, we have $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.

The period of the continued fraction is $k=1$. The fundamental solution to $x^2-2y^2=\\pm 1$ is given by the numerator and denominator of the $(k-1)=0$-th convergent, $p_0/q_0$.\nThe $0$-th convergent is $p_0/q_0 = 1/1$. We check this solution: $a=1, b=1$.\n$a^2 - 2b^2 = 1^2 - 2(1^2) = -1$.\nThis is the minimal positive integer solution. It gives the unit $\\varepsilon = 1+1\\sqrt{2} = 1+\\sqrt{2}$. Since $1+\\sqrt{2} > 1$, this is the fundamental unit.\n$\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})} = 1+\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe regulator is $R_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})} = \\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nCase 2: $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$\n\nFor $d=3$, we have $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.

The fundamental solution is given by the $(k-1)=1$-st convergent, $p_1/q_1$.\n$p_0/q_0 = 1/1$.\n$p_1/q_1 = 1+\\frac{1}{1} = 2/1$.\nWe check the solution $(a,b)=(2,1)$: $a^2 - 3b^2 = 2^2 - 3(1^2) = 4-3=1$.\nThis is the minimal positive integer solution. The corresponding unit is $\\varepsilon = 2+1\\sqrt{3}=2+\\sqrt{3}$. As $2+\\sqrt{3}>1$, this is the fundamental unit.\n$\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})} = 2+\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe regulator is $R_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})} = \\ln(2+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\nCase 3: $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$\n\nFor $d=5$, we have $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.

We test small values of $y$.\nIf $y=1$: $x^2-5(1^2)=\\pm 4$.\n- $x^2-5=4 \\implies x^2=9 \\implies x=3$. The pair is $(3,1)$. Here $x$ and $y$ have different parity, so $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is not in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n- $x^2-5=-4 \\implies x^2=1 \\implies x=1$. The pair is $(1,1)$. Here $x$ and $y$ have the same parity (both are odd).\nThis is the smallest positive integer solution satisfying the parity condition. The corresponding element is $\\alpha = \\frac{1+1\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Its norm is $N(\\alpha) = \\frac{1^2-5(1^2)}{4} = \\frac{-4}{4}=-1$, confirming it is a unit.\nSince this unit arises from the minimal solution, and since $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 1.618 > 1$, it is the fundamental unit.\n$\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nThe regulator is $R_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$.\n\nConsolidating the results for the final answer.\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$: $\\varepsilon_K = 1+\\sqrt{2}$, $R_K = \\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})$.\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$: $\\varepsilon_K = 2+\\sqrt{3}$, $R_K = \\ln(2+\\sqrt{3})$.\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$: $\\varepsilon_K = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, $R_K = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\sqrt{2} & \\ln(1+\\sqrt{2}) & 2+\\sqrt{3} & \\ln(2+\\sqrt{3}) & \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} & \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3011811"}, {"introduction": "This advanced practice pushes beyond mere application to a deeper theoretical understanding of Dirichlet's theorem and its implications for higher-rank fields.

The multiplicative group of units in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$.\n\nTo determine the rank of $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ as a finitely generated abelian group, we analyze its image under the logarithmic embedding.
