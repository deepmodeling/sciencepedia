All terms are standard and the request is for a standard derivation and conclusion in field theory.\n\nLet the given element be $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. We are asked to find the degree of the field extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is denoted as $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. This degree is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The procedure outlined in the problem is to first find a polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $\\alpha$ is a root, and then prove this polynomial is minimal.\n\nFirst, we derive a polynomial with rational coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root. We start with the equation $x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. The strategy is to eliminate the radicals through successive squaring operations.\nIsolating one radical, we have:\n$$x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{3}$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n$$(x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2$$\n$$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 2 = 3$$\nNow, we isolate the remaining term with a radical:\n$$x^2 - 1 = 2\\sqrt{2}x$$\nTo eliminate the last radical, we square both sides again:\n$$(x^2 - 1)^2 = (2\\sqrt{2}x)^2$$\n$$x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot x^2$$\n$$x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 8x^2$$\nRearranging the terms to form a polynomial equation set to zero, we obtain:\n$$x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0$$\nLet $f(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$. This is a monic polynomial with integer (and therefore rational) coefficients, and $f(\\alpha) = 0$. The degree of $f(x)$ is $4$.\n\nNext, we must justify that $f(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A polynomial is the minimal polynomial if it is monic and irreducible over the base field. We have already established that $f(x)$ is monic. We now need to prove its irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTo prove that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we first check for rational roots. According to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of $f(x)$ must be an integer divisor of the constant term, which is $1$. The only possible rational roots are therefore $1$ and $-1$.\nWe evaluate $f(x)$ at these values:\n$$f(1) = (1)^4 - 10(1)^2 + 1 = 1 - 10 + 1 = -8 \\neq 0$$\n$$f(-1) = (-1)^4 - 10(-1)^2 + 1 = 1 - 10 + 1 = -8 \\neq 0$$\nSince neither $1$ nor $-1$ is a root, $f(x)$ has no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nIf $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it must factor into a product of two quadratic polynomials, since it has no linear factors. By Gauss's Lemma, if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is also reducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, we can look for a factorization of the form:\n$$f(x) = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$$\nwhere $a, b, c, d$ are integers. Expanding this product gives:\n$$x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (d+b+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd$$\nWe compare the coefficients of this expansion with the coefficients of $f(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$:\n\n1.  Coefficient of $x^3$: $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$.\n2.  Coefficient of $x^1$: $ad+bc = 0 \\implies ad - ab = 0 \\implies a(d-b) = 0$.\n3.  Constant term: $bd = 1$.\n4.  Coefficient of $x^2$: $d+b+ac = d+b-a^2 = -10$.\n\nFrom $bd=1$, since $b$ and $d$ are integers, we have two possibilities:\nCase 1: $b=1$ and $d=1$.\nThe equation $a(d-b)=0$ becomes $a(1-1)=0$, which is $0=0$. This provides no restriction on $a$.\nSubstituting $b=1$ and $d=1$ into the equation for the $x^2$ coefficient:\n$$1+1-a^2 = -10 \\implies 2-a^2 = -10 \\implies a^2 = 12$$\nThere is no integer $a$ for which $a^2=12$. Thus, this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: $b=-1$ and $d=-1$.\nThe equation $a(d-b)=0$ becomes $a(-1 - (-1))=0$, which is $0=0$. Again, this provides no restriction on $a$.\nSubstituting $b=-1$ and $d=-1$ into the equation for the $x^2$ coefficient:\n$$-1+(-1)-a^2 = -10 \\implies -2-a^2 = -10 \\implies a^2 = 8$$\nThere is no integer $a$ for which $a^2=8$. Thus, this case is also impossible.\n\nSince both possible integer factorizations lead to a contradiction, $f(x)$ cannot be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients. Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$, and by Gauss's Lemma, it is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $f(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$ is a monic, irreducible polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $f(\\alpha)=0$, it is, by definition, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, the degree of the field extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of $f(x)$ is $4$.\nTherefore, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3019985"}, {"introduction": "While it is sometimes true that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)$, this is not a general rule.

It is a well-posed problem in abstract algebra, specifically field theory, with all terms clearly defined and no internal contradictions or scientific inaccuracies.

Thus, $\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}$.\n3.  $\\beta := \\omega \\alpha$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial for $\\omega$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is derived from the equation $x^3-1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1) = 0$. Since $\\omega \\neq 1$, it must be a root of the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_3(x) = x^2+x+1$. This quadratic polynomial has discriminant $1^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3  0$, so it has no real roots and thus no rational roots. Therefore, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of several field extension degrees. We will address them systematically.\n\n**1. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nThe element $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 2$. By Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, this polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $p(x)$ is monic and irreducible and has $\\alpha$ as a root, it is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of a simple algebraic extension is the degree of the minimal polynomial of the adjoined element.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^3 - 2) = 3$.\n\n**2. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nThe element $\\beta$ is defined as $\\omega\\alpha$. Let's compute $\\beta^3$:\n$$ \\beta^3 = (\\omega\\alpha)^3 = \\omega^3\\alpha^3 $$\nGiven $\\omega^3=1$ and $\\alpha^3=2$, we have:\n$$ \\beta^3 = (1)(2) = 2 $$\nThis shows that $\\beta$ is also a root of the polynomial $x^3-2$. As established, $x^3-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, it must also be the minimal polynomial of $\\beta$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^3 - 2) = 3$.\n\n**3. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nAs established earlier, the minimal polynomial of $\\omega$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\Phi_3(x) = x^2+x+1$.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^2+x+1) = 2$.\n\n**4. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ is the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$. Since $\\beta = \\omega\\alpha$ and $\\alpha \\neq 0$, we can express $\\omega$ as $\\omega = \\beta/\\alpha$. This implies that $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. Conversely, since $\\beta = \\omega\\alpha$, we have $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega)$. This shows that the fields are the same: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega)$.\nWe can compute the degree of this extension using the Tower Law:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] $$\nWe already know $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]=3$. The degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\omega$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. The minimal polynomial of $\\omega$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2+x+1$. This polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ if and only if its roots, $\\omega$ and $\\omega^2$, are elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$ is a subfield of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, as $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The roots of $x^2+x+1$ are $\\omega = \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\omega^2 = \\frac{-1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which are complex and not real. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ contains only real numbers, $\\omega \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nTherefore, the polynomial $x^2+x+1$ remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nSo, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)] = \\deg(x^2+x+1) = 2$.\nApplying the Tower Law:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6 $$\n\n**5. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nLet $\\gamma = \\alpha+\\beta$. We can express $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\omega$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta = \\alpha + \\omega\\alpha = \\alpha(1+\\omega) $$\nFrom the minimal polynomial of $\\omega$, we have $\\omega^2+\\omega+1=0$, which implies $1+\\omega = -\\omega^2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\alpha(-\\omega^2) = -\\alpha\\omega^2 $$\nTo find the minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$, we compute powers of $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma^3 = (-\\alpha\\omega^2)^3 = (-1)^3 (\\alpha^3) (\\omega^2)^3 = -1 \\cdot (2) \\cdot (\\omega^3)^2 = -2 \\cdot (1)^2 = -2 $$\nSo, $\\gamma$ is a root of the polynomial $q(x) = x^3+2$. By Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, $q(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $x^3+2$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe degree of the extension is the degree of this minimal polynomial.\nTherefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^3+2) = 3$.\n\n**Proof that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is a proper subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$**\nFirst, we show inclusion. The element $\\alpha+\\beta$ is formed from elements $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. Since a field is closed under addition, $\\alpha+\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is, by definition, the smallest field containing $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\alpha+\\beta$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$.\nNext, to show the subfield is proper, we must show $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. We can compare their degrees over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3 $$\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 6 $$\nSince the degrees are not equal ($3 \\neq 6$), the fields cannot be equal. This proves that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is a proper subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$.\n\n**6. Degree of $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)]$**\nWe again use the Tower Law, this time for the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta)$:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] $$\nWe have already computed the total degree and the degree of the intermediate extension:\n$$ 6 = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)] \\cdot 3 $$\nSolving for the required degree:\n$$ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)] = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 $$\nThis is the final answer requested by the problem.\n\nSummary of all computed degrees:\n- $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$\n- $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$\n- $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$\n- $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 6$\n- $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$\n- $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha+\\beta)] = 2$\n\nThe requested final answer is the last one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3019958"}, {"introduction": "The degree of a number field is just the beginning; its arithmetic is governed by its ring of integers, $\\mathcal{O}_K$.

Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)$ be a cubic number field, where $\\theta$ is a root of a monic, irreducible polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $3$. An element $\\alpha \\in K$ is called an algebraic integer if it is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. The set of all algebraic integers in $K$ forms a ring, $\\mathcal{O}_K$, which is the ring of integers of $K$. As a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is free of rank $3$, which means it possesses an integral basis $\\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\omega_3\\}$ such that any element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ can be written uniquely as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of these basis elements.\n\nThe set $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] = \\{a_0 + a_1\\theta + a_2\\theta^2 \\mid a_0, a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ forms a subring of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, called an order.

This value is equal to the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$, denoted $\\text{disc}(f)$. The discriminant of the field $K$, denoted $D_K$, is defined as the discriminant of any integral basis of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. These discriminants are related by the crucial formula:\n$$\n\\text{disc}(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 D_K\n$$\nwhere $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ is the index of the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. This index is a positive integer.\n\nThe algorithm to find an integral basis for $K$ can be outlined as follows:\n\n$1$. **Identify candidate primes:** From the index formula, if a prime number $p$ divides the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$, then $p^2$ must divide $\\text{disc}(f)$. This is because $D_K$ is an integer. Thus, the set of prime numbers that can obstruct $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ from being the full ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is limited to those primes $p$ for which $p^2$ divides $\\text{disc}(f)$. If $\\text{disc}(f)$ is a square-free integer, it immediately follows that the index must be $1$, which means $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] = \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\n$2$. **Check for index divisibility:** For each prime $p$ identified in the previous step, we must determine if $p$ actually divides the index. A key result, the Dedekind-Kummer theorem and its refinements, provides a criterion. A prime $p$ divides the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ if and only if the reduction of the polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $p$, denoted $\\bar{f}(x)$, has a repeated irreducible factor in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. That is, if the factorization of $\\bar{f}(x)$ into irreducible polynomials in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ is $\\bar{f}(x) = \\bar{g}_1(x)^{e_1} \\cdots \\bar{g}_r(x)^{e_r}$, then $p$ is a candidate for dividing the index if any exponent $e_i$ is greater than $1$.\n\n$3$. **Refine the basis:** If a prime $p$ is found for which the index is divisible by $p$, the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is not maximal at $p$, and we must enlarge it. Suppose the factorization modulo $p$ is $f(x) \\equiv g(x)^2 h(x) \\pmod{p}$, where $g(x)$ is a monic irreducible polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. We can construct a candidate for a new integral element $\\alpha$ that is not in the current order. A standard choice is $\\alpha = \\frac{T(\\theta)}{p}$, where $T(x)$ is a monic lift to $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of a specific polynomial related to the factorization, for instance, $g(x)h(x)$. One must then verify if $\\alpha$ is indeed an algebraic integer by computing its characteristic polynomial and checking if its coefficients are all integers. If $\\alpha$ is integral, we form a new, larger order $\\mathcal{O}' = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta, \\alpha]$. We find a basis for this new order, compute its discriminant (which will be $\\text{disc}(f)/p^{2k}$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$), and repeat the process starting from step $1$ with this new order and its discriminant. This procedure is repeated for each prime $p$ until no further enlargements are possible. The final basis obtained is an integral basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nNow, we apply this algorithm to the specific case where $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)$ with $f(\\theta) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we confirm $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer that divides the constant term $-1$. The only possibilities are $\\pm 1$.\n$f(1) = 1^3 - 1 - 1 = -1 \\neq 0$.\n$f(-1) = (-1)^3 - (-1) - 1 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \\neq 0$.\nSince $f(x)$ has no rational roots and is a cubic polynomial, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNext, we establish our initial order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ with basis $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$. We compute its discriminant, which is equal to the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$. The discriminant of a cubic polynomial $x^3+ax+b$ is given by the formula $-4a^3 - 27b^2$. For $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$, we have $a = -1$ and $b = -1$.\nSo, the discriminant is:\n$$\n\\text{disc}(f) = -4(-1)^3 - 27(-1)^2 = -4(-1) - 27(1) = 4 - 27 = -23.\n$$\nThe discriminant of the basis $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ is $-23$.\n\nNow we invoke the index formula:\n$$\n\\text{disc}(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 D_K\n$$\nSubstituting the value we found:\n$$\n-23 = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 D_K\n$$\nThe index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ must be a positive integer. Its square must be an integer that divides $-23$. The number $-23$ is a prime number. The only perfect square that is an integer divisor of $-23$ is $1$.\nTherefore, we must have $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 = 1$, which implies the index is $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]] = 1$.\n\nAn index of $1$ means that the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is identical to the full ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. So, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, and $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ is an integral basis for $K$.\nThis conclusion is also reached by applying step $1$ of the algorithm directly: we must check for primes $p$ such that $p^2$ divides $\\text{disc}(f) = -23$. As $-23$ is square-free, there are no such primes. The algorithm thus terminates immediately, confirming that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is the maximal order.\n\nThe discriminant of the field, $D_K$, is the discriminant of an integral basis.
