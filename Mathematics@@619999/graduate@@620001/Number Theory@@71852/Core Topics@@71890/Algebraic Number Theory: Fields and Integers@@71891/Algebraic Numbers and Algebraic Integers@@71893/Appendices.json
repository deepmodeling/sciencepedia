The analysis will be performed from first principles, using the definitions of an algebraic number, an algebraic integer, and the minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, we state the relevant definitions as per the problem's constraints.\nAn **algebraic number** is a complex number that is a root of a non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients (i.e., a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$).\nAn **algebraic integer** is a complex number that is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients (i.e., a monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$).\nThe **minimal polynomial** of an algebraic number $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the unique monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of the least possible positive degree that has $\\alpha$ as a root. A key property is that this polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe problem is divided into four sequential tasks.\n\n**1. Construct a monic polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ satisfied by $\\alpha$.**\nLet $x = \\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{d}}{2}$. Our goal is to find a polynomial relationship for $x$ with rational coefficients. We can achieve this by isolating the irrational term $\\sqrt{d}$ and then squaring to eliminate the radical.\n$$x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{d}}{2}$$\nMultiplying by $2$ gives:\n$$2x = 1 + \\sqrt{d}$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides isolates the radical:\n$$2x - 1 = \\sqrt{d}$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation eliminates the square root:\n$$(2x - 1)^2 = d$$\n$$4x^2 - 4x + 1 = d$$\nRearranging the terms to form a polynomial equation:\n$$4x^2 - 4x + (1-d) = 0$$\nThis is a polynomial equation with integer coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root. To find a monic polynomial, we divide the entire equation by the leading coefficient, which is $4$.\n$$x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4} = 0$$\nLet us define $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$. By construction, $f(\\alpha) = 0$. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are $1$, $-1$, and $\\frac{1-d}{4}$. Since $d$ is an integer, all these coefficients are rational numbers. Thus, $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ that is satisfied by $\\alpha$.\n\n**2. Prove that $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ using the congruence condition on $d$.**\nFor $f(x)$ to be in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, all its coefficients must be integers. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are $1$, $-1$, and $\\frac{1-d}{4}$. The coefficients $1$ and $-1$ are clearly integers. We must verify that the constant term, $\\frac{1-d}{4}$, is also an integer.\nWe are given the condition $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. By the definition of modular congruence, this means that $d-1$ is divisible by $4$.\nSo, there exists an integer $k$ such that $d-1 = 4k$.\nThis implies $1-d = -(d-1) = -4k$.\nNow we substitute this into the expression for the constant term of $f(x)$:\n$$\\frac{1-d}{4} = \\frac{-4k}{4} = -k$$\nSince $k$ is an integer, $-k$ is also an integer.\nTherefore, all coefficients of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 - x + (-k)$ are integers. This proves that $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\n**3. Prove that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and is therefore the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$.**\nTo show that $f(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we need to prove that it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $f(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it has roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The roots of $f(x)=0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)\\left(\\frac{1-d}{4}\\right)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - (1-d)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{d}}{2}$$\nThe roots are $\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ and its conjugate $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{d}}{2}$.\nFor $f(x)$ to be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, at least one of these roots must be a rational number. Let's test if $\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ can be rational. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then $2\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, and it would follow that $2\\alpha - 1 = \\sqrt{d}$ must also be in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe are given that $d$ is a squarefree integer and $d \\neq 1$.\nLet's prove that $\\sqrt{d}$ is irrational. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\sqrt{d}$ is rational. Then $\\sqrt{d} = \\frac{p}{q}$ for some integers $p, q$ with $q \\neq 0$ and $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$.\nSquaring both sides gives $d = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$, which leads to $dq^2 = p^2$.\nFrom this equation, we see that $q^2$ must divide $p^2$. Since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, $p^2$ and $q^2$ are also coprime. The only way for $q^2$ to divide $p^2$ is if $q^2 = 1$, which means $q = \\pm 1$.\nThis implies $d = (\\pm p)^2 = p^2$. So, $d$ must be a perfect square of an integer.\nHowever, the problem states that $d$ is a squarefree integer. An integer is squarefree if its prime factorization contains no repeated factors. If $d=p^2$ for an integer $p$, it is divisible by the square $p^2$. For $d$ to be squarefree, $p^2$ must be $1$, so $p = \\pm 1$ and $d=1$.\nBut the problem explicitly states that $d \\neq 1$.\nThis creates a contradiction, so our initial assumption that $\\sqrt{d}$ is rational must be false. Hence, $\\sqrt{d}$ is irrational.\nSince $\\sqrt{d}$ is irrational, the roots $\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{d}}{2}$ are also irrational.\nBecause the quadratic polynomial $f(x)$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ is, by definition, the monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of lowest degree having $\\alpha$ as a root. The degree of the minimal polynomial cannot be $1$, because that would imply $\\alpha$ is rational, which we have just disproven. The degree must therefore be greater than $1$. We have found a monic, irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $2$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $f(\\alpha) = 0$. It must therefore be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**4. Conclude from first principles whether $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer.**\nAn algebraic integer is defined as a number that is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients.\nIn step 1, we constructed the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$, which is monic by construction and has $\\alpha$ as a root.\nIn step 2, we used the given condition $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ to prove that all coefficients of $f(x)$ are integers, i.e., $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\nSince $\\alpha$ is a root of the monic polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\\alpha$ satisfies the definition of an algebraic integer.\nTherefore, from first principles, we conclude that $\\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{d}}{2}$ is an algebraic integer.\n\nThe explicit minimal polynomial $f(x)$ determined through this process is $x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}}\n$$", "id": "3007347"}, {"introduction": "This practice explores one of the central motivations for the development of modern algebraic number theory.

We will demonstrate the failure of unique factorization of elements, show that unique factorization of ideals holds, and then compute the class number $h_K$ to reconcile these facts.\n\nFirst, we identify the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. For a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. In our case, $d = -5$, which is square-free and satisfies $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] = \\{a + b\\sqrt{-5} \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nA crucial tool is the field norm $N: K \\to \\mathbb{Q}$, which for an element $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$ is given by $N(\\alpha) = (a + b\\sqrt{-5})(a - b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$. For any $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, its norm $N(\\alpha)$ is a non-negative integer. The norm is multiplicative, i.e., $N(\\alpha\\beta) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$ for any $\\alpha, \\beta \\in K$.\n\nThe units of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are the elements $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ with $N(\\alpha) = 1$. For $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5}$, we must have $a^2+5b^2=1$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the only solutions are $b=0$ and $a = \\pm 1$. Thus, the only units in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are $1$ and $-1$.\n\n**1. Failure of Unique Factorization of Elements**\n\nWe demonstrate that $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is not a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) by exhibiting an element with two distinct factorizations into irreducibles. Consider the integer $6$. We can write $6$ in two ways:\n$$6 = 2 \\cdot 3$$\n$$6 = (1 + \\sqrt{-5})(1 - \\sqrt{-5})$$\nTo show these are distinct factorizations into irreducibles, we must prove that the factors $2, 3, 1+\\sqrt{-5}$, and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible and not associates of each other. Since the only units are $\\pm 1$, two elements are associates if one is the negative of the other. It is clear that $2$ is not an associate of $3$, and neither are associates of $1 \\pm \\sqrt{-5}$.\n\nAn element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is irreducible if it is not a unit and if any factorization $\\alpha = \\beta\\gamma$ implies that either $\\beta$ or $\\gamma$ is a unit. Using the norm, this means that if $N(\\alpha) = N(\\beta)N(\\gamma)$, then either $N(\\beta)=1$ or $N(\\gamma)=1$.\n\n-   **Irreducibility of $2$**: $N(2) = 2^2 = 4$. If $2$ were reducible, say $2 = \\alpha\\beta$ where neither $\\alpha$ nor $\\beta$ is a unit, then $N(2) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta) = 4$. This implies $N(\\alpha)=2$. We must check if there is an element $a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$. This requires solving $a^2+5b^2=2$ for integers $a, b$. If $b=0$, $a^2=2$ has no integer solution. If $|b| \\ge 1$, then $5b^2 \\ge 5 > 2$. Thus, no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ has norm $2$. Therefore, $2$ is irreducible.\n\n-   **Irreducibility of $3$**: $N(3) = 3^2 = 9$. If $3$ were reducible, say $3 = \\alpha\\beta$, then $N(3)=N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)=9$, which implies $N(\\alpha)=3$. We seek an element $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ with norm $3$. The equation $a^2+5b^2=3$ has no integer solutions for the same reasons as above. Therefore, $3$ is irreducible.\n\n-   **Irreducibility of $1 \\pm \\sqrt{-5}$**: $N(1+\\sqrt{-5}) = 1^2+5(1^2) = 6$. If $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ were reducible, $1+\\sqrt{-5} = \\alpha\\beta$, then $N(1+\\sqrt{-5})=N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)=6$. The norm of a proper factor $N(\\alpha)$ would have to be a proper divisor of $6$, i.e., $N(\\alpha)=2$ or $N(\\alpha)=3$. As we have just shown, there are no elements in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$ or $3$. Therefore, $1+\\sqrt{-5}$ is irreducible. The same argument holds for $1-\\sqrt{-5}$ as $N(1-\\sqrt{-5})=6$.\n\nSince $6 = 2 \\cdot 3 = (1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})$ gives two factorizations of $6$ into non-associate irreducible elements, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a UFD.\n\n**2. Unique Factorization of Ideals**\n\nThe \"contradiction\" of non-unique factorization is resolved by considering ideals. $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a Dedekind domain, where every nonzero proper ideal has a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals. Let's examine the principal ideals generated by the elements from our previous example.\n\n-   **Factorization of $(2)$**: The norm of the principal ideal $(2)$ is $N((2)) = |N(2)| = 4$. Any prime ideal factor $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $(2)$ must have a norm that divides $4$. The norm of a prime ideal is a prime power, $p^k$. Let's consider the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]/(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+5, 2, 1+x)$. In the quotient, $x \\equiv -1$ and $2 \\equiv 0$. So we have $\\mathbb{Z}[-1]/(2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/(2)$, which is the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The size of the quotient ring is $2$, so the norm of the ideal is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)=2$. As its norm is a prime number, $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a prime ideal. Now consider $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5}) = (4, 2(1+\\sqrt{-5}), (1+\\sqrt{-5})^2) = (4, 2+2\\sqrt{-5}, 1-5+2\\sqrt{-5}) = (4, 2+2\\sqrt{-5}, -4+2\\sqrt{-5})$. Every generator is a multiple of $2$. Also, $(2+2\\sqrt{-5}) - (-4+2\\sqrt{-5}) = 6$. The ideal contains $4$ and $6$, so it must contain $\\gcd(4,6)=2$. Thus $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2)$. The unique factorization of the ideal $(2)$ is $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$. This is a case of ramification.\n\n-   **Factorization of $(3)$**: $N((3))=|N(3)|=9$. Let's consider the ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_3 = (3, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3' = (3, 1-\\sqrt{-5})$. For $\\mathfrak{p}_3$, the quotient $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_3$ has relations $\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv -1$ and $3 \\equiv 0$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/(3)$, which is the field $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Thus, $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3)=3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ is prime. Similarly, for $\\mathfrak{p}_3'$, we have $\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv 1$ and $3 \\equiv 0$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_3' \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/(3)$, implying $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3')=3$. Now consider their product: $\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mathfrak{p}_3' = (3, 1+\\sqrt{-5})(3, 1-\\sqrt{-5}) = (9, 3(1-\\sqrt{-5}), 3(1+\\sqrt{-5}), (1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})) = (9, 3-3\\sqrt{-5}, 3+3\\sqrt{-5}, 6)$. This ideal contains $9$ and $6$, hence it contains their gcd, $3$. Since all generators are multiples of $3$, we have $\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mathfrak{p}_3' = (3)$. Thus, the unique factorization of $(3)$ is $\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mathfrak{p}_3'$. This is a case of splitting.\n\n-   **Factorization of $(1 \\pm \\sqrt{-5})$**: $N((1+\\sqrt{-5}))=6$. Its prime factors must lie over the rational primes $2$ and $3$. A prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ divides a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$ if and only if $\\alpha \\in \\mathfrak{p}$. Since $1+\\sqrt{-5} \\in (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})=\\mathfrak{p}_2$ and $1+\\sqrt{-5} \\in (3, 1+\\sqrt{-5})=\\mathfrak{p}_3$, both $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ are factors of $(1+\\sqrt{-5})$. Since ideal norms are multiplicative, $N((1+\\sqrt{-5}))=N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)N(\\mathfrak{p}_3)=2 \\cdot 3=6$. Thus, we must have $(1+\\sqrt{-5}) = \\mathfrak{p}_2 \\mathfrak{p}_3$. Similarly, $1-\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2$ because $1-\\sqrt{-5} = 2-(1+\\sqrt{-5})$. Also $1-\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathfrak{p}_3'=(3, 1-\\sqrt{-5})$. So $(1-\\sqrt{-5})=\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\mathfrak{p}_3'$.\n\nThe unique factorization of the ideal $(6)$ is $(6)=(2)(3) = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2 \\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mathfrak{p}_3'$. The product of ideals $(1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})$ yields $(\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3)(\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3')=\\mathfrak{p}_2^2\\mathfrak{p}_3\\mathfrak{p}_3'$, which is the same unique factorization. The two different element-wise factorizations arise because the groupings of prime ideals, e.g., $(\\mathfrak{p}_2^2)$ and $(\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mathfrak{p}_3')$, correspond to principal ideals $(2)$ and $(3)$, while the groupings $(\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3)$ and $(\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3')$ correspond to principal ideals $(1+\\sqrt{-5})$ and $(1-\\sqrt{-5})$. The individual prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, $\\mathfrak{p}_3$, $\\mathfrak{p}_3'$ are not principal.\n\n**3. The Ideal Class Group and Class Number**\n\nThe ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ consists of equivalence classes of ideals, where two ideals are equivalent if they differ by a principal ideal factor. The size of this group, the class number $h_K$, measures the extent to which $\\mathcal{O}_K$ fails to be a principal ideal domain (PID). A ring is a UFD if and only if it is a PID for Dedekind domains.\n\nTo find $h_K$, we use Minkowski's bound, $M_K = \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$. For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, we have:\n-   Degree $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n-   Number of real embeddings $r_1=0$; number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings $r_2=1$.\n-   Field discriminant $\\Delta_K = 4d = 4(-5) = -20$ since $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe Minkowski bound is $M_K = \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{1} \\sqrt{|-20|} = \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sqrt{20} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} (2\\sqrt{5}) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{\\pi}$.\nUsing the approximations $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$ and $\\pi \\approx 3.142$, we get $M_K \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 2.236}{3.142} \\approx \\frac{8.944}{3.142} \\approx 2.847$.\n\nThe Dedekind-Kummer theorem implies that the ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals with norm less than or equal to $M_K$. The rational primes $p \\le M_K$ are $p=2$. So, we only need to consider the prime ideals lying over the prime $2$.\nAs shown above, the ideal $(2)$ factors as $(2)=\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$, where $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$ is a prime ideal of norm $2$. The class group is therefore generated by the ideal class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\n\nTo determine the structure of the class group, we must find the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. The order is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}_2^k$ is a principal ideal.\n-   Is $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ principal? If $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, then we would have $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = |N(\\alpha)| = 2$. As shown in the first section, the equation $a^2+5b^2=2$ has no integer solutions, so no such element $\\alpha$ exists. Thus, $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not a principal ideal, and its class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is not the identity element in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. This confirms that $h_K > 1$.\n-   Consider $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$. We have shown that $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2)$, which is a principal ideal.\nThis means that in the class group, $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [(2)]$, which is the identity class.\n\nSince the class group is generated by $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ and the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is $2$, the class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ is a cyclic group of order $2$. The elements are the class of principal ideals (the identity) and the class containing $\\mathfrak{p}_2$.\nTherefore, the class number of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ is $h_K=2$.\nThe apparent contradiction is resolved: factorization of elements is not unique because there exist non-principal ideals, and the size of the class group, $h_K=2$, quantifies this failure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3007385"}, {"introduction": "In practice, determining the full ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of a number field $K$ is a non-trivial task.

Any rational root must be an integer divisor of $-2$, i.e., in the set $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$.\n$f(1) = 1 - 4 - 2 = -5 \\neq 0$\n$f(-1) = -1 + 4 - 2 = 1 \\neq 0$\n$f(2) = 8 - 8 - 2 = -2 \\neq 0$\n$f(-2) = -8 + 8 - 2 = -2 \\neq 0$\nSince $f(x)$ has no rational roots and is of degree $3$, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is a number field of degree $n=3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe relationship between the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the discriminant of the number field $K$, denoted $d_K$, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]^2 d_K $$\nFrom this, it is clear that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha] = \\mathcal{O}_K$ if and only if the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]] = 1$. This would imply $\\Delta(f) = d_K$. A key theorem states that a prime $p$ can divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ only if the reduction of $f(x)$ modulo $p$, denoted $\\overline{f}(x)$, has a repeated factor in $\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$. This is equivalent to saying that $p$ must divide the discriminant $\\Delta(f)$. The problem directs us to use Dedekind's criterion for the primes dividing the discriminant of $f(x)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the discriminant of $f(x) = x^3 - 4x - 2$. For a cubic of the form $x^3+px+q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta(f) = -4p^3 - 27q^2$. Here, $p=-4$ and $q=-2$.\n$$ \\Delta(f) = -4(-4)^3 - 27(-2)^2 = -4(-64) - 27(4) = 256 - 108 = 148 $$\nThe prime factorization of the discriminant is $148 = 2^2 \\cdot 37$. The primes dividing the discriminant are $p=2$ and $p=37$. We will analyze the maximality of the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ at these primes using Dedekind's criterion.\n\nDedekind's criterion states that for a prime $p$, if we factor $\\overline{f}(x)$ into distinct irreducible polynomials in $\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ as $\\overline{f}(x) = \\overline{g_1}(x)^{e_1} \\cdots \\overline{g_r}(x)^{e_r}$, then the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ is not divisible by $p$ (i.e., $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is $p$-maximal) if and only if for every $i$ with exponent $e_i > 1$, we have that $\\overline{g_i}(x)$ does not divide $\\overline{h}(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$, where $h(x) = \\frac{1}{p}(f(x) - \\prod_{j=1}^r g_j(x)^{e_j})$ and $g_j(x)$ are monic lifts of $\\overline{g_j}(x)$ to $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. If all $e_i=1$, the order is automatically $p$-maximal.\n\nCase 1: $p=37$.\nWe reduce $f(x)$ modulo $37$: $\\overline{f}(x) = x^3 - 4x - 2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{37}[x]$.\nTo check for repeated factors, we compute the derivative: $\\overline{f}'(x) = 3x^2 - 4 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{37}[x]$.\nA repeated factor exists if and only if $\\gcd(\\overline{f}(x), \\overline{f}'(x)) \\neq 1$. A common root $\\beta$ would satisfy $3\\beta^2 - 4 = 0$, so $3\\beta^2 = 4$. Multiplying by the inverse of $3$ modulo $37$, which is $25$ (since $3 \\cdot 25 = 75 = 2 \\cdot 37 + 1$), we get $\\beta^2 = 4 \\cdot 25 = 100 \\equiv 26 \\pmod{37}$.\nAs shown in the problem scratchpad, the roots of this are $\\beta = \\pm 10$. Checking these in $\\overline{f}(x)$, we find that $\\overline{f}(-10) = \\overline{f}(27) = 0$.\nSo $x=27$ is a common root of $\\overline{f}(x)$ and $\\overline{f}'(x)$. This means $(x-27)$ is a repeated factor of $\\overline{f}(x)$.\nThe factorization of $\\overline{f}(x)$ modulo $37$ is $\\overline{f}(x) = (x-27)^2(x-20) \\pmod{37}$.\nWe apply Dedekind's criterion for $p=37$. We have $\\overline{g_1}(x)=x-27$ with $e_1=2 > 1$.\nLet's choose lifts $g_1(x) = x-27$ and $g_2(x)=x-20$.\nLet $F(x) = g_1(x)^2 g_2(x) = (x-27)^2(x-20)$.\nThen $f(x) - F(x) = (x^3-4x-2) - ((x-27)^2(x-20)) = 74x^2 - 1813x + 14578$.\nWe form $h(x) = \\frac{1}{37}(f(x) - F(x)) = 2x^2 - 49x + 394$.\nNow we reduce $h(x)$ modulo 37: $\\overline{h}(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 24 \\pmod{37}$.\nWe check if $\\overline{g_1}(x) = x-27$ divides $\\overline{h}(x)$. This is true if $\\overline{h}(27)=0$.\n$\\overline{h}(27) = 2(27)^2 - 12(27) + 24 = 2(-10)^2 - 12(-10) + 24 = 200 + 120 + 24 = 344$.\n$344 = 9 \\times 37 + 11 \\implies \\overline{h}(27) \\equiv 11 \\neq 0$.\nSince $\\overline{g_1}(x)$ does not divide $\\overline{h}(x)$, the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is $37$-maximal. The index is not divisible by $37$.\n\nCase 2: $p=2$.\nWe reduce $f(x)$ modulo $2$: $\\overline{f}(x) = x^3 - 4x - 2 \\equiv x^3 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe factorization is $\\overline{f}(x) = (x)^3$. So we have one irreducible factor $\\overline{g_1}(x) = x$ with multiplicity $e_1=3$.\nSince $e_1 > 1$, we must check the condition. Let $g_1(x)=x$ be a monic lift.\nLet $F(x) = g_1(x)^3 = x^3$.\nWe form $h(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(f(x)-F(x)) = \\frac{1}{2}((x^3-4x-2) - x^3) = \\frac{-4x-2}{2} = -2x-1$.\nNow we reduce $h(x)$ modulo 2: $\\overline{h}(x) = -2x - 1 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe condition for non-maximality is that $\\overline{g_1}(x)$ divides $\\overline{h}(x)$. Here, this means $x$ must divide $1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$. This is false, as $x$ is not a unit.\nTherefore, the condition for non-maximality is not met. $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is $2$-maximal, and the index is not divisible by $2$.\n\nWe have shown that the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ is not divisible by $37$ and not divisible by $2$. Since the primes dividing the index must divide the discriminant $\\Delta(f)=148=2^2 \\cdot 37$, we have shown that no prime divides the index. The only positive integer not divisible by any prime is $1$.\nTherefore, the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]] = 1$.\nThis implies that the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is the maximal order, so $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha] = \\mathcal{O}_K$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3007392"}]}
