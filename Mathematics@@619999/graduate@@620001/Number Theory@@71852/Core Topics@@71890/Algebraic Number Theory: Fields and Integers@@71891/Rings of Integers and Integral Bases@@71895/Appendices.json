We will proceed by using foundational definitions as stipulated.\n\n### 1. Determination of the Ring of Integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$\n\nAn element $\\alpha \\in K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ is an algebraic integer if it is a root of a monic polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Any element $\\alpha \\in K$ can be uniquely written as $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{5}$ for some rational numbers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by $P(x) = (x-\\alpha)(x-\\sigma(\\alpha))$, where $\\sigma$ is the non-trivial $\\mathbb{Q}$-automorphism of $K$. For $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{5}$, its conjugate is $\\sigma(\\alpha) = a - b\\sqrt{5}$.\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^2 - (\\alpha + \\sigma(\\alpha))x + \\alpha\\sigma(\\alpha)$.\nThe coefficients of this polynomial are the trace and norm of $\\alpha$ relative to the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe trace is $\\text{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha + \\sigma(\\alpha) = (a+b\\sqrt{5}) + (a-b\\sqrt{5}) = 2a$.\nThe norm is $\\text{N}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\sigma(\\alpha) = (a+b\\sqrt{5})(a-b\\sqrt{5}) = a^2 - 5b^2$.\n\nFor $\\alpha$ to be an algebraic integer, its minimal polynomial must be monic with integer coefficients. This means that $\\text{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\text{N}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, we must find all $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying:\n1. $2a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n2. $a^2 - 5b^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nFrom condition 1, let $2a = m$ for some integer $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $a = \\frac{m}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into condition 2:\n$(\\frac{m}{2})^2 - 5b^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\implies \\frac{m^2}{4} - 5b^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nMultiplying by $4$ gives $m^2 - 20b^2 \\in 4\\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $m^2 - 20b^2$ must be an integer divisible by $4$.\nLet $b = \\frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $q \\neq 0$, and $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$.\n$m^2 - 20(\\frac{p}{q})^2$ must be an integer. This implies $20 \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$ must differ from an integer ($m^2$) by an integer, so $\\frac{20p^2}{q^2}$ must be a rational whose denominator divides 1. Since $\\gcd(p^2,q^2)=1$, we must have $q^2$ divides $20$.\nThe prime factorization of $20$ is $2^2 \\cdot 5$. The integer squares that divide $20$ are $1$ and $4$.\nSo, $q^2$ can be $1$ or $4$. This implies $q$ can be $1$ or $2$.\nThis means that $b$ must be of the form $\\frac{n}{2}$ for some integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow we have established that $a = \\frac{m}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{n}{2}$ for some integers $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let's substitute these back into the second condition $a^2 - 5b^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n$(\\frac{m}{2})^2 - 5(\\frac{n}{2})^2 = \\frac{m^2}{4} - \\frac{5n^2}{4} = \\frac{m^2 - 5n^2}{4} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis is true if and only if $m^2 - 5n^2$ is divisible by $4$, i.e., $m^2 - 5n^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nConsidering this congruence modulo $4$, we have $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. So the condition becomes $m^2 - n^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, or $m^2 \\equiv n^2 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nLet's examine the squares of integers modulo $4$:\n- If $k$ is even, $k=2j$, then $k^2 = (2j)^2 = 4j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $k$ is odd, $k=2j+1$, then $k^2 = (2j+1)^2 = 4j^2+4j+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe condition $m^2 \\equiv n^2 \\pmod{4}$ can only be satisfied if $m^2$ and $n^2$ are both $0 \\pmod{4}$ or both $1 \\pmod{4}$. This is equivalent to requiring that $m$ and $n$ have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\nCase 1: $m$ and $n$ are both even. Let $m=2k_1$ and $n=2k_2$ for some $k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThen $a = \\frac{2k_1}{2} = k_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $b = \\frac{2k_2}{2} = k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe algebraic integers in this case are of the form $k_1 + k_2\\sqrt{5}$, which form the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$.\n\nCase 2: $m$ and $n$ are both odd. Let $m=2k_1+1$ and $n=2k_2+1$ for some $k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThen $a = \\frac{2k_1+1}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{2k_2+1}{2}$.\nThe algebraic integer $\\alpha$ is $\\alpha = \\frac{2k_1+1}{2} + \\frac{2k_2+1}{2}\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nCombining both cases, an algebraic integer $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{5} = \\frac{m}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}\\sqrt{5}$ (where $m, n$ have the same parity) can be expressed as:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{m-n}{2} + n\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$.\nSince $m$ and $n$ have the same parity, their difference $m-n$ is an even integer. Let $m-n = 2c_1$ for $c_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $c_2 = n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThen every algebraic integer $\\alpha$ in $K$ can be written in the form $\\alpha = c_1 + c_2 \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$ for some integers $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the set $\\left\\{ c_1 + c_2 \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) \\mid c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\right\\}$.This is commonly denoted as $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right]$.\n\n### 2. An Integral Basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$\n\nFrom the characterization of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ above, every element in the ring of integers is a unique $\\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of $1$ and $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. This suggests that the set $\\left\\{ 1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right\\}$ is an integral basis. To confirm, we must verify that both elements are themselves algebraic integers.\n\nFor $\\omega_1 = 1$: Its minimal polynomial is $x-1 = 0$. This is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, so $1$ is an algebraic integer.\nFor $\\omega_2 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$: Let $x = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Then $2x-1 = \\sqrt{5}$. Squaring both sides yields $(2x-1)^2 = 5$, which expands to $4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 5$, or $4x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0$. Dividing by $4$, we get the minimal polynomial $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$. This is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, so $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is an algebraic integer.\n\nSince the set $\\left\\{ 1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right\\}$ consists of algebraic integers, is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (and thus over $\\mathbb{Z}$), and spans $\\mathcal{O}_K$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$, it forms an integral basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\n### 3. Computation of the Field Discriminant\n\nThe field discriminant $d_K$ of a number field $K$ can be computed from any integral basis $\\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, ..., \\omega_n\\}$. For a quadratic field $K$ with integral basis $\\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2\\}$, the discriminant is given by the square of the determinant of the matrix of embeddings:\n$d_K = \\left( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1(\\omega_1) & \\sigma_1(\\omega_2) \\\\ \\sigma_2(\\omega_1) & \\sigma_2(\\omega_2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2$.\nHere, $\\sigma_1$ is the identity map and $\\sigma_2$ is the non-trivial automorphism $\\sigma(a+b\\sqrt{5}) = a-b\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nUsing the integral basis we found, $\\omega_1 = 1$ and $\\omega_2 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$:\n$\\sigma_1(\\omega_1) = 1$\n$\\sigma_2(\\omega_1) = 1$\n$\\sigma_1(\\omega_2) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n$\\sigma_2(\\omega_2) = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n\nThe matrix of embeddings is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\\\ 1 & \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nIts determinant is $(1)\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) - (1)\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = -\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe field discriminant is the square of this determinant:\n$d_K = (-\\sqrt{5})^2 = 5$.\n\nAlternatively, using the trace form of the discriminant:\n$d_K = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{Tr}(\\omega_1^2) & \\text{Tr}(\\omega_1 \\omega_2) \\\\ \\text{Tr}(\\omega_2 \\omega_1) & \\text{Tr}(\\omega_2^2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe compute the required traces:\n$\\text{Tr}(\\omega_1^2) = \\text{Tr}(1^2) = \\text{Tr}(1) = 1+1=2$.\n$\\text{Tr}(\\omega_1 \\omega_2) = \\text{Tr}(\\omega_2) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1$.\n$\\omega_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1+2\\sqrt{5}+5}{4} = \\frac{6+2\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n$\\text{Tr}(\\omega_2^2) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$.\nPlugging these values into the determinant:\n$d_K = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(3) - (1)(1) = 6 - 1 = 5$.\nBoth methods yield the same result. The field discriminant of $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3022891"}, {"introduction": "As we move to number fields of higher degree, a direct characterization of all algebraic integers becomes impractical.

The polynomial $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is monic. By definition, its roots are algebraic integers. We must establish that $P(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\theta$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This requires showing $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the rational root theorem, any rational root must be an integer dividing $5$, i.e., $\\pm 1$ or $\\pm 5$. We check: $P(1) = 1-5+5=1 \\neq 0$, $P(-1) = 1-5+5=1 \\neq 0$, $P(5) = 625-125+5 = 505 \\neq 0$, and $P(-5) = 505 \\neq 0$. Thus, $P(x)$ has no linear factors. Suppose $P(x)$ factors into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients: $x^4-5x^2+5 = (x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$. Expanding this gives $x^4+(a+c)x^3+(b+d+ac)x^2+(ad+bc)x+bd$. Comparing coefficients, we have: $a+c=0 \\implies c=-a$, and $ad+bc = a(d-b)=0$. This implies $a=0$ or $d=b$.\nIf $a=0$, then $c=0$, and we have $(x^2+b)(x^2+d)=x^4+(b+d)x^2+bd$. This would mean $b+d=-5$ and $bd=5$, so $b$ and $d$ would be roots of $t^2+5t+5=0$, which are not integers.\nIf $d=b$, we have $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+b) = (x^2+b)^2 - a^2x^2 = x^4 + (2b-a^2)x^2 + b^2$. This gives $b^2=5$, which has no integer solution for $b$.\nThus, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and is the minimal polynomial of $\\theta$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. The order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is generated by the power basis $\\{1,\\theta,\\theta^{2},\\theta^{3}\\}$.\n\nThe discriminant of this power basis, $\\Delta(\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta])$, is equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial $P(x)$. For a polynomial of the form $x^4+px^2+q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $16q(p^2-4q)^2$. For $P(x)=x^4-5x^2+5$, we have $p=-5$ and $q=5$.\n$$ \\Delta(\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]) = 16(5)((-5)^2 - 4(5))^2 = 80(25-20)^2 = 80(5)^2 = 80 \\times 25 = 2000 $$\nThe prime factorization of the discriminant is $2000 = 20 \\times 100 = (2^2 \\times 5) \\times (10^2) = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times (2 \\times 5)^2 = 2^4 \\times 5^3$.\n\nThe discriminant of the power basis $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is related to the discriminant of the field $d_K = \\Delta(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta(\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]) = \\left[\\mathcal{O}_{K}:\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]\\right]^2 d_K $$\nLet $I = \\left[\\mathcal{O}_{K}:\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]\\right]$ be the index. We have $2000 = I^2 d_K$. This implies that any prime factor of the index $I$ must also be a prime factor of $\\Delta(\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta])$. Therefore, the only possible prime factors of $I$ are $2$ and $5$. We use Dedekind's index criterion to test these primes.\n\nCase 1: $p=2$.\nWe reduce $P(x)$ modulo $2$:\n$$ \\bar{P}(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 5 \\equiv x^4 + x^2 + 1 \\pmod 2 $$\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$, this factors as $(x^2+x+1)^2$. The polynomial $\\bar{g}(x)=x^2+x+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ since it has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ ($\\bar{g}(0)=1$, $\\bar{g}(1)=1$). We have a repeated factor with exponent $e=2$. Let $g(x)=x^2+x+1$ be the monic lift in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We compute the polynomial $H(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(P(x) - g(x)^2)$.\n$$ g(x)^2 = (x^2+x+1)^2 = x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1 $$\n$$ P(x) - g(x)^2 = (x^4-5x^2+5) - (x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1) = -2x^3-8x^2-2x+4 $$\nThis is divisible by $2$.\n$$ H(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(-2x^3-8x^2-2x+4) = -x^3-4x^2-x+2 $$\nNow we check if $\\bar{g}(x)$ divides $\\bar{H}(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$.\n$$ \\bar{H}(x) = -x^3-4x^2-x+2 \\equiv x^3+x \\pmod 2 $$\nTo check for divisibility, we can use polynomial division or check for common roots in an extension field. $\\bar{H}(x)=x(x^2+1)=x(x+1)^2$. The irreducible factor $\\bar{g}(x)=x^2+x+1$ is coprime to $\\bar{H}(x)$.

A natural choice is $\\{1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2\\}$.\n\n**2. Analysis at the prime $p=3$ and Global Conclusion**\n\nWe now analyze the prime $p=3$. We apply Dedekind's Index Criterion. First, we reduce the minimal polynomial $f(x)=x^3-2$ modulo $3$:\n$$ f(x) \\equiv x^3-2 \\equiv x^3+1 \\pmod 3 $$\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$, this polynomial factors as $(x+1)^3$. We have a repeated irreducible factor $\\bar{g}(x) = x+1$ with multiplicity $e=3 \\ge 2$.\nAccording to Dedekind's criterion, the prime $3$ divides the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K:\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ if and only if $\\bar{g}(x)$ divides a certain test polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$. Let $g(x) = x+1$ be a monic lift of $\\bar{g}(x)$ to $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. The test polynomial is $\\bar{H}(x)$, where $H(x) = \\frac{1}{3}(f(x) - g(x)^3)$.\nWe compute:\n$$ f(x) - g(x)^3 = (x^3-2) - (x+1)^3 = (x^3-2) - (x^3+3x^2+3x+1) = -3x^2 - 3x - 3 $$\nThis is divisible by 3.\n$$ H(x) = \\frac{1}{3}(-3x^2 - 3x - 3) = -x^2 - x - 1 $$\nNow, we reduce $H(x)$ modulo 3 to get $\\bar{H}(x)$:\n$$ \\bar{H}(x) \\equiv -x^2 - x - 1 \\pmod 3 $$\nThe criterion states that 3 divides the index if $\\bar{g}(x)$ divides $\\bar{H}(x)$. We can test this by evaluating $\\bar{H}(x)$ at the root of $\\bar{g}(x)=x+1$, which is $x=-1$.\n$$ \\bar{H}(-1) = -(-1)^2 - (-1) - 1 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3 $$\nSince $\\bar{g}(x)$ does not divide $\\bar{H}(x)$, Dedekind's criterion tells us that the prime $3$ does not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$. Therefore, $v_3([\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]) = 0$.\n\nWe have shown that the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ is not divisible by $2$ (from Part 1) and not divisible by $3$. As these are the only possible prime divisors of the index (since they are the only prime divisors of $\\mathrm{disc}(f)=-108$), the index must be $1$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is the full ring of integers of $K$, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Field Discriminant $D_K$**\n\nSince we have concluded that $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$, an integral basis for $K$ is given by $\\{1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2\\}$. The field discriminant $D_K$ is the discriminant of this integral basis, which is equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial $f(x)=x^3-2$.\nAs computed earlier,\n$$ D_K = \\mathrm{disc}(x^3-2) = -108. $$\nAlternatively, we can compute $D_K$ as the determinant of the Gram matrix of the trace form with respect to the integral basis $\\{\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3\\} = \\{1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2\\}$.\n$$ D_K = \\det\\big(\\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta_i \\beta_j)\\big) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathrm{Tr}(1) & \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha) & \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^2) \\\\ \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha) & \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^2) & \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^3) \\\\ \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^2) & \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^3) & \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^4) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe trace of an element is the sum of its Galois conjugates. The roots of $x^3-2=0$ are $\\alpha$, $\\alpha\\omega$, and $\\alpha\\omega^2$, where $\\omega = \\exp(2\\pi i/3)$. Using Newton's sums for the polynomial $x^3-2=0$, with power sums $p_k = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^k)$ and elementary symmetric polynomials $e_1=0$, $e_2=0$, $e_3=2$:\n$p_1 = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha) = e_1=0$.\n$p_2 = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^2) = e_1 p_1 - 2e_2 = 0$.\n$p_3 = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^3) = \\mathrm{Tr}(2) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\n$p_4 = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha^4) = \\mathrm{Tr}(2\\alpha) = 2\\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha)=0$.\nAnd $\\mathrm{Tr}(1)=3$. The matrix of traces is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 6 \\\\ 0 & 6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $3(0 \\cdot 0 - 6 \\cdot 6) = 3(-36) = -108$.\nBoth methods yield the same result. The field discriminant is $D_K=-108$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-108}$$", "id": "3022895"}]}
