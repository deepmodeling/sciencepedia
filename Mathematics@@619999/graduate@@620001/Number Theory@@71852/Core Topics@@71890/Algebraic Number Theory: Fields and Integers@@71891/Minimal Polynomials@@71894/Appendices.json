All definitions and premises are standard in the field of abstract algebra. The problem is valid.\n\nThe problem asks for two results: the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}]$. We will first find a polynomial with rational coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root, and then we will determine the degree of the extension to prove that this polynomial is indeed the minimal polynomial.\n\nLet $x = \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. To find a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ for which $\\alpha$ is a root, we must eliminate the square roots through algebraic manipulation.\n$$x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$$\nIsolate one of the square roots and square both sides of the equation:\n$$x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{3}$$\n$$(x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2$$\n$$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 2 = 3$$\nRearrange the equation to isolate the remaining square root term:\n$$x^2 - 1 = 2\\sqrt{2}x$$\nSquare both sides again to eliminate the last square root:\n$$(x^2 - 1)^2 = (2\\sqrt{2}x)^2$$\n$$x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot x^2$$\n$$x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 8x^2$$\nBringing all terms to one side gives a polynomial equation with rational coefficients:\n$$x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0$$\nLet $p(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$. The polynomial $p(x)$ is monic (its leading coefficient is $1$), it belongs to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, and it has $\\alpha$ as a root, i.e., $p(\\alpha)=0$. By definition, the minimal polynomial $m_{\\alpha}(x)$ must divide $p(x)$. To prove that $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial, we must show that it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the minimal polynomial of an algebraic element $\\alpha$ over a field $K$ is equal to the degree of the field extension $K(\\alpha)/K$, i.e., $\\deg(m_{\\alpha}(x)) = [K(\\alpha):K]$. If we can show that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$, then since $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree $4$ that annihilates $\\alpha$, it must be the minimal polynomial.\n\nWe now establish the relationship between the fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nFirst, since $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$, and both $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, their sum $\\alpha$ must also be in this field. This implies $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n\nNext, we show that $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nWe have $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. Let us compute $\\alpha^3$:\n$$\\alpha^3 = (\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^3 = (\\sqrt{2})^3 + 3(\\sqrt{2})^2(\\sqrt{3}) + 3(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^3$$\n$$\\alpha^3 = 2\\sqrt{2} + 3(2)\\sqrt{3} + 3\\sqrt{2}(3) + 3\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{2} + 6\\sqrt{3} + 9\\sqrt{2} + 3\\sqrt{3} = 11\\sqrt{2} + 9\\sqrt{3}$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations in variables $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$:\n$$ \\alpha = 1\\sqrt{2} + 1\\sqrt{3} $$\n$$ \\alpha^3 = 11\\sqrt{2} + 9\\sqrt{3} $$\nMultiply the first equation by $9$:\n$$ 9\\alpha = 9\\sqrt{2} + 9\\sqrt{3} $$\nSubtracting this from the equation for $\\alpha^3$:\n$$ \\alpha^3 - 9\\alpha = (11\\sqrt{2} + 9\\sqrt{3}) - (9\\sqrt{2} + 9\\sqrt{3}) = 2\\sqrt{2} $$\nThus, $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\alpha^3 - 9\\alpha}{2}$. Since $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, any polynomial in $\\alpha$ with rational coefficients is also in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nSince $\\sqrt{3} = \\alpha - \\sqrt{2}$ and both $\\alpha, \\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, it follows that $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nBecause $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nCombining both inclusions, we have demonstrated that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nThis implies $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}]$. We now compute this degree, which will also answer the second part of the problem.\n\nWe compute the degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}]$ using the Tower Law for the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nThe Tower Law states that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\nFirst, we find $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]$. The element $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Alternatively, its roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $x^2-2$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n\nNext, we find $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]$. This degree is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The element $\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 3$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if its roots, $\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, are not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nAssume for contradiction that $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Then $\\sqrt{3}$ can be written as $a + b\\sqrt{2}$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Squaring both sides gives:\n$$3 = (a + b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$$\nRearranging gives $2ab\\sqrt{2} = 3 - a^2 - 2b^2$.\nIf $a=0$ or $b=0$, we reach a contradiction. If $b=0$, $\\sqrt{3}=a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, impossible. If $a=0$, $\\sqrt{3}=b\\sqrt{2}$, which implies $3=2b^2$, so $b^2=3/2$, which is impossible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, then $2ab \\neq 0$. We can write $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{3 - a^2 - 2b^2}{2ab}$. The right-hand side is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}$, but $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the assumption is false, and $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The polynomial $x^2-3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It is therefore the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\n\nUsing the Tower Law, we compute the degree of the total extension:\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$$\nThis is the answer to the second part of the problem.\n\nFinally, we return to the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$. We have shown that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]=[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. The degree of the minimal polynomial $m_\\alpha(x)$ must be $4$. We found a monic polynomial $p(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree $4$ such that $p(\\alpha)=0$. Since $m_\\alpha(x)$ must divide $p(x)$, and they have the same degree and are both monic, they must be equal. Thus, $m_{\\alpha}(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$. The fact that this is the minimal polynomial also serves as the justification for its irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial is $m_{\\alpha}(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3017525"}, {"introduction": "The minimal polynomial of an element is not an intrinsic property of the number itself, but is fundamentally dependent on the base field.

We must use definitions and fundamental theorems of field theory.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted $m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}}$. We begin by finding a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ that has $\\alpha$ as a root.\nLet $x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $x^2 = (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 2 + 3 + 2\\sqrt{6} = 5 + 2\\sqrt{6}$.\nRearranging the terms to isolate the radical gives $x^2 - 5 = 2\\sqrt{6}$.\nSquaring again eliminates the remaining radical: $(x^2 - 5)^2 = (2\\sqrt{6})^2$, which simplifies to $x^4 - 10x^2 + 25 = 24$.\nThis gives us the polynomial $p(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0$, which has $\\alpha$ as a root and has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial $m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}}$ must divide $p(x)$. The degree of $m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}}$ is equal to the degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$. We can determine this degree using the Tower Law.\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})$ contains $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. To see this, note that $\\alpha^{-1} = (\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^{-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{3})^2-(\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, its inverse $\\alpha^{-1}$ is also in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. Thus, sums and differences are also in the field:\n$\\alpha + \\alpha^{-1} = (\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) + (\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}) = 2\\sqrt{3}$, so $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n$\\alpha - \\alpha^{-1} = (\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) - (\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}) = 2\\sqrt{2}$, so $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. Conversely, since $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$, $\\alpha$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, which means $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Therefore, we have the equality of fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n\nNow consider the tower of extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nThe degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$ because the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-2$, which is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$).\nThe degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This polynomial is $x^2-3$. It is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Suppose, for contradiction, that $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Then $\\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2}$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Squaring both sides gives $3 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, and $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, this equality can only hold if $2ab=0$. This implies either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nIf $a=0$, then $3 = 2b^2 \\implies b^2=3/2$, which is impossible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, then $3=a^2$, which is impossible for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the assumption is false, and $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The polynomial $x^2-3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\n\nBy the Tower Law, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, we have $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\nThe degree of the minimal polynomial must be equal to this degree, so $\\deg m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}} = 4$. Since we found a monic polynomial $p(x)$ of degree $4$ that has $\\alpha$ as a root, $p(x)$ must be the minimal polynomial $m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}}(x)$.\n\nNext, we determine the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, denoted $m_{\\alpha,F}$. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\in F$, we can treat it as a constant in our base field.\nLet $x = \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$.\nThen $x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nSquaring both sides gives $(x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = 3$.\nExpanding this, we get $x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 2 = 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x - 1 = 0$.\nLet $q(x) = x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x - 1$. The coefficients of $q(x)$ are $1$, $-2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-1$, which are all in $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So, $q(x) \\in F[x]$.\nThe degree of $m_{\\alpha,F}$ is given by $[F(\\alpha):F]$. The field $F(\\alpha)$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})$. As $\\sqrt{2}$ is already in the base field, $F(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nSo, the degree required is $[F(\\alpha):F] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]$. As we proved before, this degree is $2$.\nTherefore, $\\deg m_{\\alpha,F} = 2$. Since $q(x)$ is a monic polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $2$ and $q(\\alpha)=0$, it must be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $F$. So, $m_{\\alpha,F}(x) = x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x - 1$.\n\nFinally, we justify the inequality $\\deg m_{\\alpha,F} < \\deg m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}}$.\nWe have the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset F \\subset F(\\alpha)$. From our work above, we know that $F(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nThe Tower Law asserts that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):F] \\cdot [F:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nBy definition, the degrees of minimal polynomials are equal to the degrees of the corresponding field extensions:\n$\\deg m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}} = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n$\\deg m_{\\alpha,F} = [F(\\alpha):F] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):F]$.\n$[F:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\nSubstituting these into the Tower Law gives $\\deg m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}} = \\deg m_{\\alpha,F} \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nWe have shown $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. Since $2 > 1$, it is a non-trivial extension. This implies that $\\deg m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}} = 2 \\cdot \\deg m_{\\alpha,F}$.\nSince $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3} \\notin F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the degree $\\deg m_{\\alpha,F} = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):F]$ must be greater than $1$. We found it to be $2$.\nThus, $\\deg m_{\\alpha,F} = 2$ and $\\deg m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}} = 4$.\nThe inequality $2 < 4$ is self-evident, and is a direct consequence of the fact that $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a proper intermediate field in the extension $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe ordered pair $(\\deg m_{\\alpha,F}, \\deg m_{\\alpha,\\mathbb{Q}})$ is $(2, 4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3017532"}, {"introduction": "This exercise introduces a powerful and elegant strategy for finding a minimal polynomial, particularly for elements with a specific algebraic structure.

The degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$.\n\nThe number $\\beta$ is defined as $\\beta = \\alpha + \\alpha^{-1}$. Since $\\alpha^3 - 2 = 0$, we have $\\alpha^3 = 2$, which implies $\\alpha \\neq 0$, so its inverse $\\alpha^{-1}$ is well-defined.

We start with the definition of $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\alpha + \\alpha^{-1}\n$$\nTo find a polynomial relation for $\\beta$, we compute its third power:\n$$\n\\beta^3 = (\\alpha + \\alpha^{-1})^3\n$$\nUsing the binomial expansion $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$, we get:\n$$\n\\beta^3 = \\alpha^3 + 3\\alpha^2(\\alpha^{-1}) + 3\\alpha(\\alpha^{-1})^2 + (\\alpha^{-1})^3\n$$\n$$\n\\beta^3 = \\alpha^3 + 3\\alpha + 3\\alpha^{-1} + \\alpha^{-3}\n$$\nWe can regroup the terms as follows:\n$$\n\\beta^3 = (\\alpha^3 + \\alpha^{-3}) + 3(\\alpha + \\alpha^{-1})\n$$\nWe know that $\\alpha + \\alpha^{-1} = \\beta$. We also know $\\alpha^3 = 2$, so $\\alpha^{-3} = (\\alpha^3)^{-1} = 2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\beta^3$:\n$$\n\\beta^3 = \\left(2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 3\\beta\n$$\n$$\n\\beta^3 = \\frac{5}{2} + 3\\beta\n$$\nRearranging this equation to have zero on one side, we obtain:\n$$\n\\beta^3 - 3\\beta - \\frac{5}{2} = 0\n$$\nThis shows that $\\beta$ is a root of the polynomial $Q(X) = X^3 - 3X - \\frac{5}{2}$.\nThis polynomial $Q(X)$ is monic, has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$, and is of degree $3$. Since we have already established that the minimal polynomial for $\\beta$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must have degree $3$, $Q(X)$ must be the minimal polynomial.\n\nThe minimal polynomial for $\\beta$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is therefore $X^3 - 3X - \\frac{5}{2}$. The problem asks for a single closed-form analytic expression for this monic polynomial.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{X^3 - 3X - \\frac{5}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3017523"}]}
