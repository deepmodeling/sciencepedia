The relation is given by:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = (-1)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \\frac{1}{a_n} \\text{Res}(f, f') $$\nFor our cubic polynomial, $n=3$ and $a_n=1$. The exponent is $\\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3$. Thus, the relation simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = (-1)^{3} \\text{Res}(f, f') = -\\text{Res}(f, f') $$\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b$.\n\nTo compute the discriminant in terms of the coefficients $a,b,c$, we can first simplify the polynomial by a change of variables to eliminate the $x^2$ term. This does not change the differences between the roots, and hence does not change the discriminant.\nLet $x = y - \\frac{a}{3}$. Substituting this into $f(x)$ gives a new polynomial $g(y) = f(y - a/3)$.\n$$ g(y) = \\left(y-\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^3 + a\\left(y-\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 + b\\left(y-\\frac{a}{3}\\right) + c $$\n$$ g(y) = \\left(y^3 - ay^2 + \\frac{a^2}{3}y - \\frac{a^3}{27}\\right) + a\\left(y^2 - \\frac{2a}{3}y + \\frac{a^2}{9}\\right) + b\\left(y-\\frac{a}{3}\\right) + c $$\n$$ g(y) = y^3 + \\left(b - \\frac{a^2}{3}\\right)y + \\left(c - \\frac{ab}{3} + \\frac{2a^3}{27}\\right) $$\nThis is a depressed cubic of the form $g(y) = y^3 + py + q$, where\n$p = b - \\frac{a^2}{3}$ and $q = c - \\frac{ab}{3} + \\frac{2a^3}{27}$.\nSince the roots of $g(y)$ are $s_i = r_i + a/3$, we have $s_i - s_j = r_i - r_j$, and thus $\\Delta(f) = \\Delta(g)$.\nFor a depressed cubic $y^3+py+q=0$, the discriminant is known to be $\\Delta(g) = -4p^3-27q^2$.

Let $\\Delta_K$ be the absolute discriminant of the field $K$ and $\\mathcal{O}_K$ be its ring of integers. The discriminant of the polynomial, $\\Delta(f)$, is related to the field discriminant $\\Delta_K$ by the index formula:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 \\Delta_K $$\nwhere $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ is the index of the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ in the maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_K$. For the polynomial discriminant to equal the field discriminant, this index must be $1$. This occurs if and only if $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, which means $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ forms an integral basis for $K$.\n\nCase $f_1(x) = x^3 - x - 1$ and $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta_1)$:\nWe found $\\Delta(f_1) = -23$. The index formula is $-23 = [\\mathcal{O}_{K_1} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta_1]]^2 \\Delta_{K_1}$. Since the index must be an integer, its square must be a perfect square that divides $23$. As $23$ is a prime number, the only perfect square divisor is $1$. Therefore, $[\\mathcal{O}_{K_1} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta_1]]^2 = 1$, which implies the index is $1$. Consequently, $\\mathcal{O}_{K_1} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta_1]$ and the field discriminant is $\\Delta_{K_1} = \\Delta(f_1) = -23$.\n\nCase $f_2(x) = x^3 - 2$ and $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta_2)$, where $\\theta_2 = \\sqrt[3]{2}$:\nWe found $\\Delta(f_2) = -108$. The index formula is $-108 = [\\mathcal{O}_{K_2} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta_2]]^2 \\Delta_{K_2}$. Here, $\\Delta(f_2)$ is not square-free, so we cannot use the same argument. Instead, we appeal to a standard result concerning the ring of integers of pure cubic fields of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{d})$ where $d$ is a cubefree integer. In our case, $d=2$. The theorem states that if $d \\not\\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod 9$, then the ring of integers is precisely $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{d}]$. Since $d=2$ does not satisfy $2 \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod 9$, we can conclude that $\\mathcal{O}_{K_2} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$. Thus, the index $[\\mathcal{O}_{K_2} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta_2]]$ is $1$. This implies that the field discriminant is equal to the polynomial discriminant, $\\Delta_{K_2} = \\Delta(f_2) = -108$.\n\nSummary of results:\n1. The general formula for the discriminant is $\\Delta(f) = a^2b^2 - 4b^3 - 4a^3c + 18abc - 27c^2$.\n2. The discriminant of $f_1(x)=x^3-x-1$ is $-23$.\n3.

Since $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, its root $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer. The set $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is an order in the number field $K$, and $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is the maximal order (the ring of integers). The index $[\\mathcal{O}_{K}:\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ measures how far the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is from being the maximal order.\n\nThe index, which we shall denote by $i(\\alpha) = [\\mathcal{O}_{K}:\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$, relates the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$, denoted $\\Delta(f)$, to the discriminant of the number field $K$, denoted $\\Delta_K$, via the fundamental formula:\n$$\n\\Delta(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_{K}:\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]^2 \\cdot \\Delta_K = i(\\alpha)^2 \\cdot \\Delta_K\n$$\nOur first step is to compute the discriminant of the given polynomial. For a cubic polynomial of the form $x^3 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -4p^3 - 27q^2$. For $f(x)=x^{3}-3x-1$, we have $p=-3$ and $q=-1$.\nSubstituting these values, we find the discriminant of the polynomial:\n$$\n\\Delta(f) = -4(-3)^3 - 27(-1)^2 = -4(-27) - 27(1) = 108 - 27 = 81\n$$\nSo, we have $\\Delta(f) = 81 = 3^4$.\n\nFrom the relation $\\Delta(f) = i(\\alpha)^2 \\cdot \\Delta_K$, we have $81 = i(\\alpha)^2 \\cdot \\Delta_K$. Since $i(\\alpha)$ and $\\Delta_K$ are integers, $i(\\alpha)^2$ must be a square divisor of $81$. The only prime factor of $81$ is $3$. Consequently, the only prime that could possibly divide the index $i(\\alpha)$ is $p=3$. To determine whether $3$ divides $i(\\alpha)$, we employ Dedekind's index criterion as instructed.\n\nDedekind's index criterion provides a method to determine precisely which primes divide the index $i(\\alpha)$. The criterion states:\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$.

Let $\\phi_i(x)$ be any monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ that reduces to $\\bar{\\phi}_i(x)$ modulo $p$. We form the polynomial $S(x) = \\frac{1}{p} \\left( f(x) - \\prod_{i=1}^g \\phi_i(x)^{e_i} \\right)$. The coefficients of the polynomial in the numerator are guaranteed to be divisible by $p$. The condition is that $\\bar{S}(x)$ is not divisible by $\\bar{\\phi}_i(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$.\n\nWe apply this criterion for the prime $p=3$. First, we factor $f(x)$ modulo $3$:\n$$\nf(x) \\pmod 3 = x^3 - 3x - 1 \\pmod 3 \\equiv x^3 - 1 \\pmod 3\n$$\nIn the field $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$, this polynomial factors as:\n$$\n\\bar{f}(x) = x^3 - 1 = (x-1)^3\n$$\nIn this factorization, there is a single distinct monic irreducible factor, $\\bar{\\phi}_1(x) = x-1$, with multiplicity $e_1 = 3$. Since $e_1 = 3 > 1$, we must check the condition of the criterion to determine if $3$ divides the index.\n\nLet $\\phi_1(x) = x-1$ be the monic lift of $\\bar{\\phi}_1(x)$ to $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We construct the polynomial $S(x)$:\n$$\nS(x) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( f(x) - \\phi_1(x)^3 \\right)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator:\n$$\nf(x) - \\phi_1(x)^3 = (x^3 - 3x - 1) - (x-1)^3\n$$\nExpanding $(x-1)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1$, we get:\n$$\nf(x) - \\phi_1(x)^3 = (x^3 - 3x - 1) - (x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1) = 3x^2 - 6x\n$$\nAs expected, the coefficients are divisible by $3$. Now we can write $S(x)$:\n$$\nS(x) = \\frac{3x^2 - 6x}{3} = x^2 - 2x\n$$\nNext, we reduce $S(x)$ modulo $3$ to get $\\bar{S}(x)$:\n$$\n\\bar{S}(x) = x^2 - 2x \\pmod 3 \\equiv x^2 + x \\pmod 3\n$$\nThe final step of the criterion is to check if $\\bar{S}(x)$ is divisible by $\\bar{\\phi}_1(x) = x-1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$. Divisibility can be checked by evaluating $\\bar{S}(x)$ at the root of $\\bar{\\phi}_1(x)$, which is $x=1$:\n$$\n\\bar{S}(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2 \\pmod 3\n$$\nSince $\\bar{S}(1) \\neq 0$, $\\bar{\\phi}_1(x)$ does not divide $\\bar{S}(x)$.\n\nThe condition in Dedekind's criterion for $p=3$ not to divide the index is fulfilled. Therefore, $3$ does not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$.\nSince $3$ was the only possible prime divisor of the index, we conclude that no prime number divides the index. The only positive integer with no prime divisors is $1$.\nThus, the index must be $1$.\n$$\n[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]] = 1\n$$\nThis result implies that the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is, in fact, the maximal order, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$.
