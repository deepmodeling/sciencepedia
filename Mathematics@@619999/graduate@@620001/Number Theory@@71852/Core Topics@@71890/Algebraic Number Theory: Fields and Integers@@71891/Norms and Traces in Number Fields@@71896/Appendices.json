Thus, there are exactly two such embeddings, which we shall denote by $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$.\n\nAn embedding $\\sigma: K \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a field homomorphism, and it is defined to be the identity on $\\mathbb{Q}$.

The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is called a **real quadratic field**.\nSince $D$ is positive, $\\sqrt{D}$ is a real number. The field $K$ is a subfield of the real numbers, $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$. Both embeddings, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, map $K$ into $\\mathbb{R}$.\n$\\sigma_1(\\alpha) = a + b\\sqrt{D} \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n$\\sigma_2(\\alpha) = a - b\\sqrt{D} \\in \\mathbb{R}$\nThe norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = a^2 - b^2D$. Because $D > 0$, the term $b^2D$ is positive (for $b \\neq 0$). Therefore, the sign of the norm is not fixed. It can be positive, negative, or zero. For instance, in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the element $3+\\sqrt{2}$ has norm $3^2 - 1^2(2) = 7 > 0$, while the element $1+\\sqrt{2}$ has norm $1^2 - 1^2(2) = -1 < 0$.\n\nCase 2: $D < 0$. The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is called an **imaginary quadratic field**.\nSince $D$ is negative, $\\sqrt{D}$ is a purely imaginary number. Let $D = -d$ where $d = -D > 0$ is a positive squarefree integer. Then $\\sqrt{D} = i\\sqrt{d}$. The field $K$ is a subfield of the complex numbers, $K \\subset \\mathbb{C}$, but it is not a subfield of the real numbers. The two embeddings map $K$ into $\\mathbb{C}$:\n$\\sigma_1(\\alpha) = a + b\\sqrt{D} = a + ib\\sqrt{d}$\n$\\sigma_2(\\alpha) = a - b\\sqrt{D} = a - ib\\sqrt{d}$\nIn this case, the images $\\sigma_1(\\alpha)$ and $\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$ are complex conjugates of each other: $\\sigma_2(\\alpha) = \\overline{\\sigma_1(\\alpha)}$. The embeddings themselves form a complex conjugate pair.\nThe norm is the product of an element and its complex conjugate:\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha) \\cdot \\overline{\\sigma_1(\\alpha)} = |\\sigma_1(\\alpha)|^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the norm calculated previously:\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = a^2 - b^2D = a^2 - b^2(-d) = a^2 + b^2d\n$$\nSince $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $d>0$, the terms $a^2$ and $b^2d$ are both non-negative.\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = a^2 + b^2d \\ge 0\n$$\nThe norm is zero if and only if $a=0$ and $b=0$, which implies $\\alpha=0$. For any non-zero element $\\alpha \\in K$ where $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field, the norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ is strictly positive.\n\nThe final formulas for the trace and norm are:\n$\\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{D}) = 2a$\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{D}) = a^2 - b^2D$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2a & a^2 - b^2D \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3019724"}, {"introduction": "This practice introduces a powerful alternative perspective: viewing elements of a number field as linear transformations on the field itself.

The derivation must be based on the characteristic polynomial of the multiplication-by-$\\alpha$ map, $m_{\\alpha}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the context. Since $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is a cubic number field, the degree of the field extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=3$. This means $K$ is a $3$-dimensional vector space over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. As the degree of the minimal polynomial $p(t)$ is $3$, a basis for $K$ as a $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space is given by the set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2\\}$.\n\nThe problem defines the trace and norm in terms of the $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear map $m_{\\alpha}: K \\to K$, where $m_{\\alpha}(\\beta) = \\alpha\\beta$. To analyze this linear map, we represent it as a matrix with respect to the basis $\\mathcal{B}$. We apply $m_{\\alpha}$ to each basis vector:\n$m_{\\alpha}(1) = \\alpha \\cdot 1 = \\alpha$. In the basis $\\mathcal{B}$, this is $(0, 1, 0)$, i.e., $0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\alpha + 0 \\cdot \\alpha^2$.\n$m_{\\alpha}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha = \\alpha^2$. In the basis $\\mathcal{B}$, this is $(0, 0, 1)$, i.e., $0 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot \\alpha + 1 \\cdot \\alpha^2$.\n$m_{\\alpha}(\\alpha^2) = \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha^2 = \\alpha^3$. Since $\\alpha$ is a root of its minimal polynomial, we have $p(\\alpha) = \\alpha^3 + a\\alpha + b = 0$. This gives us a representation of $\\alpha^3$ in terms of the basis vectors: $\\alpha^3 = -b - a\\alpha$. In the basis $\\mathcal{B}$, this is $(-b, -a, 0)$, i.e., $-b \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot \\alpha + 0 \\cdot \\alpha^2$.\n\nThe columns of the matrix representation of $m_{\\alpha}$, which we denote $M_{\\alpha}$, are the coordinate vectors of the images of the basis vectors. Therefore,\n$$M_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -b \\\\ 1 & 0 & -a \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to use the characteristic polynomial of $m_{\\alpha}$, defined as $\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = \\det(tI - m_{\\alpha})$. Using the matrix representation $M_{\\alpha}$, this is $\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = \\det(tI - M_{\\alpha})$.\n$$tI - M_{\\alpha} = t\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -b \\\\ 1 & 0 & -a \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} t & 0 & b \\\\ -1 & t & a \\\\ 0 & -1 & t \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe compute the determinant of this matrix:\n$$\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} t & 0 & b \\\\ -1 & t & a \\\\ 0 & -1 & t \\end{pmatrix} = t \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} t & a \\\\ -1 & t \\end{pmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & a \\\\ 0 & t \\end{pmatrix} + b \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & t \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = t(t^2 - (a)(-1)) + b((-1)(-1) - t(0))$$\n$$\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = t(t^2 + a) + b(1) = t^3 + at + b$$\nThus, the characteristic polynomial of $m_{\\alpha}$ is identical to the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, $\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = p(t)$.\n\nNow, we relate the characteristic polynomial to the trace and determinant. For any $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, its characteristic polynomial $\\chi_A(t) = \\det(tI - A)$ has the general form:\n$$\\chi_A(t) = t^n - \\mathrm{Tr}(A)t^{n-1} + \\dots + (-1)^n \\det(A)$$\nIn our case, $n=3$ and the matrix is $M_{\\alpha}$. So, the general form is:\n$$\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = t^3 - \\mathrm{Tr}(M_{\\alpha})t^2 + c_1 t - \\det(M_{\\alpha})$$\nwhere $c_1$ is the coefficient of the $t$ term, and we have used the fact that the constant term is $\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(0) = \\det(-M_{\\alpha}) = (-1)^3 \\det(M_{\\alpha}) = -\\det(M_{\\alpha})$.\n\nThe problem defines the field trace and norm as $\\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\mathrm{Tr}(m_{\\alpha}) = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_{\\alpha})$ and $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\det(m_{\\alpha}) = \\det(M_{\\alpha})$. Substituting these definitions into the general form of the characteristic polynomial gives:\n$$\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = t^3 - \\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) t^2 + c_1 t - N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$$\nWe now equate the coefficients of this polynomial with the coefficients of the polynomial we computed, $\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}(t) = t^3 + at + b = t^3 + 0 \\cdot t^2 + a \\cdot t + b$.\n$$t^3 - \\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) t^2 + c_1 t - N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = t^3 + 0 \\cdot t^2 + a \\cdot t + b$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of $t$, we deduce the following:\n1.

Comparing the constant terms (the coefficients of $t^0$):\n    $$-N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = b \\implies N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = -b$$\nThis completes the derivation as required by the problem.

Computation of $\\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_{m})$**\n\nThe field extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, where $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\phi(m)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function. The Galois group, $\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, consists of $\\phi(m)$ distinct automorphisms $\\sigma_k$. These automorphisms are determined by their action on the generator $\\zeta_m$: for each integer $k$ such that $1 \\le k < m$ and $\\gcd(k, m) = 1$, there is an automorphism $\\sigma_k$ defined by $\\sigma_k(\\zeta_m) = \\zeta_m^k$.\n\nThe absolute trace of an element $\\alpha \\in K$ is defined as the sum of the images of $\\alpha$ under all embeddings of $K$ into $\\mathbb{C}$. For a Galois extension, this is the sum of the images of $\\alpha$ under all automorphisms in the Galois group. Applying this definition to $\\alpha = \\zeta_m$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_m) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})} \\sigma(\\zeta_m)\n$$\nSubstituting the action of the automorphisms, we get the sum over all primitive $m$-th roots of unity:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\zeta_m) = \\sum_{\\substack{1 \\le k < m \\\\ \\gcd(k,m)=1}} \\zeta_m^k\n$$\nThis sum is a classical object known as a Ramanujan sum, denoted $c_m(1)$. We can evaluate it using the Mobius inversion formula. Let $S(n) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\zeta_n^j$. We know that $S(1) = 1$ and $S(n) = 0$ for $n > 1$. The sum of all $n$-th roots of unity can be partitioned according to the order of the roots:\n$$\nS(n) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\zeta_n^j = \\sum_{d|n} \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le k < d \\\\ \\gcd(k,d)=1}} \\zeta_d^k\n$$\nLet $T(d) = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le k < d \\\\ \\gcd(k,d)=1}} \\zeta_d^k$. Our goal is to find $T(m)$. We have the relation $S(n) = \\sum_{d|n} T(d)$. By the Mobius inversion formula, if $S(n) = \\sum_{d|n} T(d)$, then $T(n) = \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(n/d)S(d)$, where $\\mu$ is the Mobius function.\n\nFor $m \\ge 2$, we have:\n$$\nT(m) = \\sum_{d|m} \\mu(m/d)S(d)\n$$\nSince $m \\ge 2$, any divisor $d>1$ will have $S(d)=0$.

Computation of $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_{m})$**\n\nThe absolute norm of an element $\\alpha \\in K$ is defined as the product of the images of $\\alpha$ under all embeddings of $K$ into $\\mathbb{C}$.

The norm is therefore:\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_m) = \\prod_{\\substack{1 \\le k < m \\\\ \\gcd(k,m)=1}} (1 - \\zeta_m^k)\n$$\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_m$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the $m$-th cyclotomic polynomial, $\\Phi_m(x)$, whose roots are precisely the primitive $m$-th roots of unity:\n$$\n\\Phi_m(x) = \\prod_{\\substack{1 \\le k < m \\\\ \\gcd(k,m)=1}} (x - \\zeta_m^k)\n$$\nEvaluating the polynomial at $x=1$ gives:\n$$\n\\Phi_m(1) = \\prod_{\\substack{1 \\le k < m \\\\ \\gcd(k,m)=1}} (1 - \\zeta_m^k)\n$$\nThus, we have $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_m) = \\Phi_m(1)$. To find the value of $\\Phi_m(1)$, we use the fundamental identity relating cyclotomic polynomials:\n$$\nx^n - 1 = \\prod_{d|n} \\Phi_d(x)\n$$\nFor $n > 1$, we can divide by $\\Phi_1(x) = x-1$ to get $\\frac{x^n-1}{x-1} = 1 + x + \\dots + x^{n-1} = \\prod_{d|n, d>1} \\Phi_d(x)$. Evaluating this at $x=1$ yields:\n$$\nn = \\prod_{d|n, d>1} \\Phi_d(1)\n$$\nLet's analyze this relationship.\n- If $m=p^k$ for a prime $p$ and integer $k \\ge 1$: The divisors of $p^k$ greater than $1$ are $p, p^2, \\dots, p^k$. The identity gives $p = \\Phi_p(1)$. Then $p^2 = \\Phi_p(1)\\Phi_{p^2}(1) = p \\Phi_{p^2}(1)$, so $\\Phi_{p^2}(1)=p$. By induction, $p^k = \\prod_{j=1}^k \\Phi_{p^j}(1) = (\\prod_{j=1}^{k-1} p) \\Phi_{p^k}(1) = p^{k-1}\\Phi_{p^k}(1)$, which implies $\\Phi_{p^k}(1) = p$.\n- If $m$ has at least two distinct prime factors, say $m=p_1^{e_1} \\dots p_r^{e_r}$ with $r \\ge 2$: We apply the identity $m = \\prod_{d|m, d>1} \\Phi_d(1)$.\n$$\nm = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\prod_{j=1}^{e_i} \\Phi_{p_i^j}(1) \\cdot \\prod_{d|m, d \\text{ not a prime power}} \\Phi_d(1)\n$$\nUsing our result from the prime power case, $\\prod_{j=1}^{e_i} \\Phi_{p_i^j}(1) = \\prod_{j=1}^{e_i} p_i = p_i^{e_i}$.\n$$\nm = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{e_i}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{d|m, d \\text{ not a prime power}} \\Phi_d(1)\\right) = m \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{d|m, d \\text{ not a prime power}} \\Phi_d(1)\\right)\n$$\nThis implies that the product over non-prime-power divisors is $1$. Since the terms in this product, $\\Phi_d(1)$, are positive integers (as $d>2$ for such divisors), each term must be equal to 1. Thus, if $m$ has at least two distinct prime factors, $\\Phi_m(1)=1$.\n\nIn summary:\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1-\\zeta_m) = \\Phi_m(1) = \\begin{cases} p & \\text{if } m=p^k \\text{ for a prime } p \\text{ and integer } k \\geq 1 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } m \\text{ has at least two distinct prime factors} \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**3. Significance of these Quantities**\n\n- **Multiplicative Inversion (Units):** An algebraic integer $\\alpha$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_m]$ is a unit (i.e., its multiplicative inverse exists within $\\mathcal{O}_K$) if and only if its absolute norm is $\\pm 1$. Our computation of $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_m)$ shows that $1 - \\zeta_m$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_m]$ if and only if $m$ has at least two distinct prime factors. If $m$ is a prime power, $m=p^k$, then $1 - \\zeta_m$ is not a unit. This distinction is fundamental to the study of cyclotomic units, a special group of units in cyclotomic fields that play a major role in algebraic number theory, for example in class number formulas.\n\n- **Ramification of Primes:** The norm of an element is intimately connected to the prime ideal factorization in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Specifically, $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$ is the norm of the principal ideal $(\\alpha)$. Our result $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1-\\zeta_m) = p$ when $m=p^k$ is of paramount importance. It means the principal ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (1 - \\zeta_{p^k})$ has norm $p$. An ideal with norm $p$ must be a prime ideal lying over the rational prime $p$.\nIn the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{p^k})/\\mathbb{Q}$, the prime $p$ is known to be totally ramified. This means the ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ factors as a pure power of a single prime ideal: $p\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}^{\\phi(p^k)}$, where $\\phi(p^k)$ is the degree of the extension. The identity $p = \\Phi_{p^k}(1) = \\prod_{\\gcd(j,p^k)=1} (1-\\zeta_{p^k}^j)$ shows the factorization of the number $p$ into algebraic integers in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The factors $(1-\\zeta_{p^k}^j)$ are all associates of $(1-\\zeta_{p^k})$, meaning they generate the same ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$. Thus, the identity for the norm leads directly to the ideal factorization $p\\mathcal{O}_K = (1-\\zeta_{p^k})^{\\phi(p^k)}$, demonstrating that $p$ is totally ramified and that the unique prime ideal above $p$ is generated by $1-\\zeta_{p^k}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mu(m) & \n\\begin{cases} p & \\text{if } m=p^k \\text{ for a prime } p, k \\geq 1 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } m \\text{ has at least two distinct prime factors} \\end{cases}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3019742"}]}
