Chen's theorem ensures that, for many choices of $p$, the value $N-p$ lies in the structured subset of $A(N)$ consisting of primes and semiprimes. However, this additional structure does not alter the cardinality of $A(N)$ itself, which is determined purely by the injective correspondence between primes $\\leq N$ and their differences $N-p$.

All definitions are standard and the premises are mathematically sound. I shall proceed with the derivation and subsequent evaluation.\n\nThe first objective is to derive a closed-form expression for the size of the sifted set, $\\lvert S(A,\\mathcal{P},z)\\rvert$. By definition,\n$$S(A,\\mathcal{P},z)=\\{a \\in A : \\operatorname{gcd}(a,P(z))=1\\}.$$\nThe size of this set is found by summing over the elements of $A$ a characteristic function that is $1$ if the condition $\\operatorname{gcd}(a,P(z))=1$ is met, and $0$ otherwise. The problem statement provides the characteristic function for the property $n=1$ using the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$:\n$$\\sum_{d \\mid n} \\mu(d) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } n=1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n>1 \\end{cases}$$\nWe can apply this identity by setting $n = \\operatorname{gcd}(a,P(z))$.

The summand $\\mu(d)$ is independent of $a$. The number of such elements $a$ is precisely the definition of $\\lvert A_d \\rvert$, where $A_d = \\{a \\in A : d \\mid a\\}$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\lvert S(A,\\mathcal{P},z)\\rvert = \\sum_{d \\mid P(z)} \\mu(d) \\lvert A_d \\rvert.$$\nThe sifting modulus $P(z)$ is defined as the product of distinct primes less than $z$, so it is a squarefree integer. Any divisor $d$ of a squarefree integer is itself squarefree. For a squarefree integer $d$ that is the product of $k$ distinct primes, $\\mu(d) = (-1)^k$. For any integer that is not squarefree, the Möbius function is $0$. Thus, the summation is naturally restricted to the squarefree divisors of $P(z)$, which is precisely what the problem asked to show.

Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is structured in three parts. I shall address each in sequence.\n\n**Part 1: The choice of sifting level $z=N^{1/3}$**\n\nWe are asked to explain why any element $a \\in \\mathcal{A}_{N}=\\{N-p: p \\leq N, p \\text{ prime}\\}$ with no prime factor less than or equal to $z=N^{1/3}$ must have at most two prime factors.\n\nLet $a$ be an element of $\\mathcal{A}_{N}$. By definition, $a = N-p$ for some prime $p \\leq N$, which implies $a < N$. Let's assume $N$ is large enough so that $N-p > 1$. Let the prime factorization of $a$ be $a = q_{1}q_{2}\\dots q_{k}$, where $q_{1} \\leq q_{2} \\leq \\dots \\leq q_{k}$ are the prime factors of $a$.\n\nWe are given that $a$ has no prime factor less than or equal to $z = N^{1/3}$. This means that for every prime factor $q_{i}$ of $a$, we must have $q_i > z = N^{1/3}$.\n\nNow, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $a$ has three or more prime factors, i.e., $k \\geq 3$. In this case, the value of $a$ would be at least the product of its three smallest prime factors:\n$$\na \\geq q_{1}q_{2}q_{3}\n$$\nGiven our condition that all prime factors are greater than $z$, we have:\n$$\na > z \\cdot z \\cdot z = z^{3} = (N^{1/3})^{3} = N\n$$\nThis leads to the inequality $a > N$. However, we know that $a = N-p < N$. This is a direct contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that $a$ has three or more prime factors must be false.\n\nThis means that $a$ can have at most two prime factors, i.e., $k \\leq 2$. An integer with at most two prime factors (counted with multiplicity) is either a prime or a semiprime.\n\nThe quantity $R_{2}(N)$ is defined as the number of primes $p \\leq N$ such that $N-p$ has at most two prime factors. The set $S(\\mathcal{A}_{N},z)$ is the set of elements in $\\mathcal{A}_{N}$ with no prime factors $\\leq z$. Let its cardinality be $|S(\\mathcal{A}_{N},z)|$. As we have shown, every element $a$ counted in $|S(\\mathcal{A}_{N},z)|$ has at most two prime factors. Each such $a=N-p$ corresponds to a unique prime $p$. Thus, $|S(\\mathcal{A}_{N},z)|$ counts a subset of the primes $p$ that are counted by $R_{2}(N)$. Consequently, a lower bound for $|S(\\mathcal{A}_{N},z)|$ is also a lower bound for $R_{2}(N)$.\n\n**Part 2: The linear sieve lower bound**\n\nWe are asked to use the one-dimensional linear sieve to derive a lower bound for $|S(\\mathcal{A}_{N},z)|$. The general formula for the lower bound provided by the Jurkat-Richert theory for a linear sieve of dimension $\\kappa=1$ is:\n$$\n|S(\\mathcal{A},z)| \\geq X V(z) f(s) - R_{D}\n$$\nwhere $R_D$ is a remainder term. The problem statement provides this in the form:\n$$\n|S(\\mathcal{A}_{N},z)| \\geq X \\, V(z) \\, f(3) + o\\!\\left(\\frac{N}{\\ln^{2} N}\\right)\n$$\nLet's identify the components based on the problem's givens.\n- $\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{A}_{N}=\\{N-p: p \\leq N, p \\text{ prime}\\}$. The size of this set is $X = |\\mathcal{A}_{N}| = \\pi(N)$, the number of primes up to $N$. By the Prime Number Theorem, $X \\sim \\frac{N}{\\ln N}$.\n- The sifting product is $V(z)=\\prod_{\\substack{r \\leq z \\\\ r \\text{ odd},\\, r \\nmid N}}\\left(1-\\frac{g(r)}{1}\\right)$, where the sifting density for an odd prime $r \\nmid N$ is given as $g(r)=\\frac{1}{r-1}$. So, $V(z)=\\prod_{\\substack{r \\leq z \\\\ r \\text{ odd},\\, r \\nmid N}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{r-1}\\right)$.\n- The sieve parameter $s$ is given to be $s=3$. This value is justified by reference to advanced techniques (\"Chen's double sieve switching method\") which effectively extend the reach of the sieve beyond what is possible with the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem alone (which would only yield $s=\\frac{\\ln(N^{1/2})}{\\ln(N^{1/3})} = \\frac{3}{2}$).\n- The linear sieve lower bound function $f(s)$ is given, and specifically for $s=3$, its value is stated as $f(3)=\\frac{2\\exp(\\gamma)}{3}$.\n- The error term, specified as $o(N/\\ln^2 N)$, is stated to be negligible. This is a standard consequence of the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem, which controls the errors in estimating the number of primes in arithmetic progressions, the key input for the sieve's remainder term. Since the main term will be of order $\\frac{N}{\\ln^2 N}$, an error of $o(\\frac{N}{\\ln^2 N})$ is asymptotically insignificant.\n\nAssembling these pieces confirms the provided formula for the lower bound is the correct application of the linear sieve framework as specified in the problem.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the constant $c$**\n\nWe must now evaluate the main term $X \\cdot V(z) \\cdot f(3)$ to find the constant $c$ in the lower bound $R_{2}(N) \\geq c \\, \\frac{N}{\\ln^{2} N}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the asymptotic behavior of $V(z)$. The problem guides us to evaluate the product over all odd primes up to $z$, which provides a universally applicable lower bound independent of the specific prime factors of $N$. The factor $\\prod_{p|N,p>2}\\frac{p-1}{p-2}$ is always $\\geq 1$, so ignoring it (i.e., replacing it with its minimum value of $1$) preserves the lower bound for all large even $N$.\nWe have $V(z) \\approx \\prod_{\\substack{p \\leq z \\\\ p \\text{ odd}}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p-1}\\right) = \\prod_{3 \\leq p \\leq z} \\frac{p-2}{p-1}$.
