The formulation of the Selberg sieve bound, the definitions of the parameters $s, z, D$, the sifting density $V(z)$, and the remainder terms $R_d$ are all consistent with established literature (e.g., \"Opera de Cribro\" by Friedlander and Iwaniec, \"Sieve Methods\" by Halberstam and Richert). The dimension is specified as one, which corresponds to the \"linear sieve\". The use of Mertens' theorem is appropriate.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The task is to minimize a given expression by choosing parameters, which is a well-defined optimization problem. The goal of finding an asymptotic leading term is standard in this field.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a formal, non-trivial mathematical problem directly related to the specified topic of the Selberg sieve.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to minimize the expression for the upper bound, which we denote by $B$:\n$$\nB(z, D) = X\\,V(z)\\,F(s) + \\sum_{d\\leq D}|R_d|\n$$\nwhere $s = \\frac{\\ln D}{\\ln z}$.\n\nFirst, we establish asymptotic forms for the terms in the expression.\n\nThe sifting is on the sequence of all integers, so the number of sifted residue classes modulo a prime $p$ is $\\omega(p)=1$. Assuming the sifting set $\\mathcal{P}$ is the set of all prime numbers, the sifting density $V(z)$ is given by\n$$\nV(z) = \\prod_{p<z} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega(p)}{p}\\right) = \\prod_{p<z} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)\n$$\nBy Mertens' third theorem, for large $z$, this has the asymptotic behavior\n$$\nV(z) \\sim \\frac{e^{-\\gamma}}{\\ln z}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nThe remainder term sum is $\\sum_{d\\leq D}|R_d|$. The problem defines $R_d$ for square-free $d$ and gives the bound $|R_d| \\leq 1$. The sum is over $d \\le D$ and, in the context of the Selberg sieve, these $d$ arise from square-free divisors of $P(z)=\\prod_{p<z}p$. A standard and effective bound for the sum of remainders in application is obtained by summing the uniform bound over all integers up to $D$:\n$$\n\\sum_{d\\leq D}|R_d| \\leq \\sum_{d\\leq D} 1 = \\lfloor D \\rfloor \\leq D\n$$\nNote that a more precise treatment would sum over square-free $d$, yielding a bound of $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}D+o(D)$, but this constant factor does not affect the leading order of the final result. We proceed using the bound $D$ for the error term.\n\nThe expression to minimize is now asymptotically\n$$\nB(z, D) \\approx X \\frac{e^{-\\gamma}}{\\ln z} F(s) + D\n$$\nWe need to choose the parameters $z$ and $D$ to minimize this. It is more convenient to work with the parameters $s$ and $D$. We express $\\ln z$ in terms of $s$ and $D$:\n$$\n\\ln z = \\frac{\\ln D}{s}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B$, we get\n$$\nB(s, D) \\approx X e^{-\\gamma} F(s) \\frac{s}{\\ln D} + D\n$$\nThe optimization can be performed in two steps. First, for a fixed level of distribution $D$, we choose $s$ (which is equivalent to choosing $z$) to minimize the main term. This requires us to minimize the product $sF(s)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that $F(s)$ is the \"linear sieve upper-bound function\". This function is well-known from the work of Jurkat and Richert. For sieve dimension $\\kappa=1$, its key property is\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{2e^\\gamma}{s} \\quad \\text{for } 0 < s \\leq 3\n$$\nFor $s>3$, the function $sF(s)$ is strictly increasing. Therefore, the product $sF(s)$ is minimized on the interval $(0, \\infty)$ by taking any $s$ in the range $(0, 3]$. In this range, the minimum value is\n$$\n\\min_{s>0} \\{sF(s)\\} = s \\cdot \\frac{2e^\\gamma}{s} = 2e^\\gamma\n$$\nJustification for the choice of $s$: The first principle of optimizing the sieve bound is to make a choice of parameters that minimizes the expression. By parameterizing the bound in terms of $s$ and $D$, we see that the dependence on $s$ is captured by the factor $sF(s)$. The analysis of the standard linear sieve function $F(s)$ shows that $sF(s)$ is minimal for $s \\in (0,3]$. Any choice in this range is therefore optimal for this part of the minimization. A canonical choice often made is $s=2$, which corresponds to the \"parity barrier\" of sieve theory, $D=z^2$. We choose $s$ to be in this optimal range.\n\nWith $sF(s) = 2e^\\gamma$, our bound becomes a function of $D$ alone:\n$$\ng(D) = X e^{-\\gamma} \\frac{2e^\\gamma}{\\ln D} + D = \\frac{2X}{\\ln D} + D\n$$\nNow, we must minimize $g(D)$ with respect to $D$. We differentiate $g(D)$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\ng'(D) = -\\frac{2X}{D(\\ln D)^2} + 1 = 0\n$$\nThis gives the condition for the optimal $D$:\n$$\nD(\\ln D)^2 = 2X\n$$\nTo find the asymptotic behavior of the minimized bound, we first find the asymptotic behavior of $D$. Taking the logarithm of the condition gives $\\ln D + 2\\ln(\\ln D) = \\ln(2X)$. For large $X$, the term $\\ln D$ must dominate, so $\\ln D \\approx \\ln(2X) \\approx \\ln X$. More precisely, $\\ln D = \\ln X + O(\\ln\\ln X)$.\n\nThe minimum value of the bound is $g(D) = \\frac{2X}{\\ln D} + D$. Using the condition $D = \\frac{2X}{(\\ln D)^2}$, we can write the bound as\n$$\ng(D) = \\frac{2X}{\\ln D} + \\frac{2X}{(\\ln D)^2}\n$$\nAs $X \\to \\infty$, we have $\\ln D \\to \\infty$. The first term $\\frac{2X}{\\ln D}$ dominates the second term $\\frac{2X}{(\\ln D)^2}$.\nThe leading term of the minimized bound is therefore\n$$\n\\frac{2X}{\\ln D}\n$$\nUsing the asymptotic equivalence $\\ln D \\sim \\ln X$, the leading term of the minimized bound is\n$$\n\\frac{2X}{\\ln X}\n$$\nThis result is a classic manifestation of the \"factor of 2\" that appears in the upper bound for the number of primes using a linear sieve, where the true asymptotic is $X/\\ln X$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2X}{\\ln(X)}}$$", "id": "3029457"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of the sieve's general optimization, we now turn to a classic and challenging application: sifting a polynomial sequence.

The solution process will now commence.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem asks for two main results: the explicit formula for the main term density $V(z)$ in the Selberg sieve context, and its leading-order asymptotic behavior.\n\n**Part 1: The Euler Product for V(z)**\n\nIn sieve theory, the proportion of elements remaining after sieving by primes less than $z$ is heuristically given by the product of local densities of survival. For a prime $p$, there are $\\rho(p)$ \"forbidden\" residue classes modulo $p$. A random integer $n$ has a probability of $\\rho(p)/p$ for $f(n)$ to be divisible by $p$. The probability of $f(n)$ not being divisible by $p$ is therefore $1 - \\rho(p)/p$. Assuming independence for different primes, the proportion of $n$ for which $f(n)$ is not divisible by any prime $p < z$ is given by the product over these primes.\n\nThis quantity, denoted by $V(z)$, is defined as:\n$$\nV(z) = \\prod_{p<z} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho(p)}{p}\\right)\n$$\nWe are given the values of $\\rho(p)$ for the polynomial $f(n) = n^2+1$:\n- $\\rho(2) = 1$\n- $\\rho(p) = 2$ if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n- $\\rho(p) = 0$ if $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $V(z)$:\n$$\nV(z) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho(2)}{2}\\right) \\prod_{2 < p < z} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho(p)}{p}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV(z) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\prod_{\\substack{2 < p < z \\\\ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{p}\\right) \\prod_{\\substack{2 < p < z \\\\ p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}}} \\left(1 - \\frac{0}{p}\\right)\n$$\nThe second product is a product of terms equal to $1$. Since the prime $2$ is not congruent to $1 \\pmod 4$, we can simplify the expression to:\n$$\nV(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\prod_{\\substack{p < z \\\\ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{p}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the explicit Euler product expression for $V(z)$.\n\n**Part 2: Asymptotic Behavior of V(z)**\n\nTo find the asymptotic behavior of $V(z)$ as $z \\to \\infty$, we analyze the product. A key step is to relate the term $(1 - 2/p)$ to the more standard term $(1-1/p)$ which appears in Mertens' theorems. We use the identity:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{2}{p} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)^2 \\frac{1 - 2/p}{(1-1/p)^2} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)^2 \\frac{p(p-2)}{(p-1)^2} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{p^2-2p}{p^2-2p+1}\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right)\n$$\nApplying this to the expression for $V(z)$:\n$$\nV(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\prod_{\\substack{p < z \\\\ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}}} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nV(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\prod_{\\substack{p < z \\\\ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{\\substack{p < z \\\\ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right) \\right]^2\n$$\nThe first product converges as $z \\to \\infty$ because the terms are $1 - O(1/p^2)$ and $\\sum 1/p^2$ converges. Let $C_1 = \\prod_{p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right)$.\n\nThe second part involves the product $P_1(z) = \\prod_{p<z, p\\equiv 1(4)} (1 - 1/p)$. We use Mertens' theorems for arithmetic progressions. Let $P_3(z) = \\prod_{p<z, p\\equiv 3(4)} (1 - 1/p)$.\nThe product over all odd primes is:\n$$\nP_1(z) P_3(z) = \\prod_{2 < p < z} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{p<z}(1-1/p)}{1-1/2} = 2 \\prod_{p<z}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)\n$$\nBy Mertens' third theorem, $\\prod_{p<z}(1-1/p) \\sim e^{-\\gamma}/\\ln z$, where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Thus,\n$$\nP_1(z) P_3(z) \\sim \\frac{2e^{-\\gamma}}{\\ln z}\n$$\nNow, consider the non-principal Dirichlet character modulo $4$, $\\chi(n)$, where $\\chi(n)=1$ if $n\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $\\chi(n)=-1$ if $n\\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, and $\\chi(n)=0$ if $n$ is even. The Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,\\chi) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\chi(n)n^{-s}$ has the value $L(1,\\chi) = \\pi/4$.\nThe Euler product for $L(s,\\chi)$ is $\\prod_p (1-\\chi(p)p^{-s})^{-1}$. The product $\\prod_{p>2} (1 - \\chi(p)/p)$ converges to $L(1,\\chi)^{-1} = 4/\\pi$. We can write this product as:\n$$\n\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\prod_{2 < p < z} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}\\right) = \\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\left[ \\prod_{\\substack{p<z \\\\ p\\equiv 1(4)}} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{p}\\right) \\prod_{\\substack{p<z \\\\ p\\equiv 3(4)}} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{p}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\n$$\nLet $P_3'(z) = \\prod_{p<z, p\\equiv 3(4)} (1+1/p)$. Then $\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} P_1(z)P_3'(z) = 4/\\pi$.\nWe relate $P_3(z)$ and $P_3'(z)$:\n$$\nP_3(z) P_3'(z) = \\prod_{\\substack{p<z \\\\ p\\equiv 3(4)}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^2}\\right) \\to C_3 = \\prod_{p\\equiv 3(4)} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^2}\\right) \\quad \\text{as } z \\to \\infty.\n$$\nFrom these relations, we deduce the asymptotic behavior of $P_1(z)$.\n$P_1(z) \\sim K_1 (\\ln z)^{-1/2}$ and $P_3(z) \\sim K_3 (\\ln z)^{-1/2}$ for some constants $K_1, K_3$.\nFrom $P_1(z) P_3(z) \\sim 2e^{-\\gamma}/\\ln z$, we get $K_1 K_3 = 2e^{-\\gamma}$.\nFrom $P_1(z) P_3'(z) \\to 4/\\pi$ and $P_3'(z) \\sim C_3/P_3(z) \\sim C_3/(K_3 (\\ln z)^{-1/2})$, we get\n$ (K_1 (\\ln z)^{-1/2}) (C_3 K_3^{-1} (\\ln z)^{1/2}) \\to \\frac{K_1 C_3}{K_3} = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$, so $\\frac{K_1}{K_3} = \\frac{4}{\\pi C_3}$.\nSolving for $K_1^2$:\n$$\nK_1^2 = (K_1 K_3) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_3}\\right) = (2e^{-\\gamma})\\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi C_3}\\right) = \\frac{8e^{-\\gamma}}{\\pi \\prod_{p\\equiv 3(4)}(1-1/p^2)}\n$$\nThus, $P_1(z)^2 = \\left[ \\prod_{p<z, p\\equiv 1(4)} (1 - 1/p) \\right]^2 \\sim K_1^2 (\\ln z)^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we assemble the asymptotic for $V(z)$:\n$$\nV(z) \\sim \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot C_1 \\cdot P_1(z)^2 \\sim \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\prod_{p \\equiv 1(4)} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right) \\right] \\left[ \\frac{8e^{-\\gamma}}{\\pi \\ln z \\prod_{p\\equiv 3(4)}(1-1/p^2)} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nV(z) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\ln z} \\cdot \\frac{4e^{-\\gamma}}{\\pi} \\frac{\\prod_{p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right)}{\\prod_{p\\equiv 3 \\pmod 4}\\left(1-1/p^2\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the leading-order asymptotic estimate for the proportion.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\n1.

The Selberg inequality is a cornerstone of modern sieve theory. The choice of weights $\\lambda_d^{\\mathrm{hard}}$ corresponds to a truncated inclusion-exclusion principle, while the $\\lambda_d^{\\mathrm{sm}}$ weights introduce a standard analytic smoothing technique. The function $s(u)=3u^2-2u^3$ is a common smoothstep polynomial. The investigation of numerical stability as a function of sieve parameters is a meaningful exercise in computational number theory.\n2.  **Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is well-posed. All parameters ($x, z, D_j, \\eta$) are specified for each test case. The mathematical definitions for the weights and the stability metric are unambiguous. A unique numerical solution exists and is computationally feasible. The hint to use a \"divisor-multiple accumulation\" points to an efficient algorithm, which is necessary given the magnitude of $x$.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is formal and objective. The tasks are purely computational and based on established mathematical formulas.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be developed and implemented.\n\n### Solution and Algorithmic Design\n\nThe objective is to numerically compare the stability of a Selberg sieve upper bound under two different choices of weights, $\\lambda_d$. The stability is measured by observing the variation of the upper bound $\\mathcal{U}(x, z, D; \\lambda)$ as the cutoff parameter $D$ is perturbed. The core of the problem is the efficient and exact computation of this upper bound.\n\nThe operative upper bound is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}(x,z,D;\\lambda) = \\sum_{n=1}^{x} \\left( \\sum_{\\substack{d \\mid n \\\\ d \\mid P(z) \\\\ d \\leq D}} \\lambda_d \\right)^2\n$$\nA naive triple-loop evaluation over $n$, its divisors $d$, and then again for the square is computationally prohibitive. A more efficient strategy, as suggested by the problem, is to compute the inner sum for each $n$ first. Let $S_n = \\sum_{d \\mid n, d \\mid P(z), d \\leq D} \\lambda_d$. We can then compute $\\mathcal{U} = \\sum_{n=1}^{x} S_n^2$.\n\nThe \"divisor-multiple accumulation\" technique is employed to calculate all $S_n$ values efficiently. This involves the following steps:\n1.  Initialize a real-valued array, `S_array`, of size $x+1$ to zeros.\n2.  Iterate through each relevant divisor $d$ (i.e., squarefree, $d \\mid P(z)$, $d \\leq D$). For each such $d$, the corresponding weight $\\lambda_d$ is non-zero.\n3.  For each $d$, add its weight $\\lambda_d$ to the elements of `S_array` at indices which are multiples of $d$. That is, for each $n = kd \\leq x$, we perform the update `S_array[n] += lambda_d`.\n4.  After iterating through all relevant $d$, the entry `S_array[n]` will hold the value of $S_n$. This process has a computational complexity of approximately $\\sum_{d \\leq D} \\frac{x}{d} \\approx x \\log D$, which is efficient enough for the given parameters.\n5.  Finally, the upper bound $\\mathcal{U}$ is computed by summing the squares of the elements of the `S_array` from index $1$ to $x$.\n\nThe overall algorithm is structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Preprocessing**: For each test case, with parameters $(x, z, \\{D_1,D_2,D_3\\}, \\eta)$, the maximum value of $D$, denoted $D_{\\max} = \\max\\{D_1, D_2, D_3\\}$, is determined.\n    - A list of prime numbers $p < z$ is generated using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n    - The set of all squarefree integers $d \\leq D_{\\max}$ such that all prime factors of $d$ are less than $z$ is generated. This is equivalent to finding all $d \\mid P(z)$ with $d \\leq D_{\\max}$. This can be done with a recursive (depth-first search) algorithm, starting from $d=1$ and successively multiplying by primes from the generated list. During this generation, the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ is also computed, as it is needed for both weight families. We store these as a map from $d$ to $\\mu(d)$.\n\n2.  **Main Loop**: The program iterates through each of the three cutoff values $D_j \\in \\{D_1, D_2, D_3\\}$. For each $D_j$:\n    - **Hard Cutoff Weights**: A set of weights $\\{\\lambda_d^{\\mathrm{hard}}\\}$ is created. For each generated squarefree divisor $d$, if $d \\leq D_j$, $\\lambda_d^{\\mathrm{hard}} = \\mu(d)$.\n    - **Smooth Cutoff Weights**: A set of weights $\\{\\lambda_d^{\\mathrm{sm}}\\}$ is created. For each generated squarefree divisor $d \\leq D_j$, the value $\\lambda_d^{\\mathrm{sm}} = \\mu(d) s(u(d))$ is computed, where $u(d) = \\min\\{1, \\max\\{0, \\frac{\\log(D_j/d)}{\\eta \\log D_j}\\}\\}$ and $s(u) = 3u^2 - 2u^3$. Note that for $d>D_j$, $u(d)=0$ and so $\\lambda_d^{\\mathrm{sm}}=0$.\n    - **Compute Bounds**: Using the divisor-multiple accumulation method described above, the upper bounds $\\mathcal{U}(x, z, D_j; \\lambda^{\\mathrm{hard}})$ and $\\mathcal{U}(x, z, D_j; \\lambda^{\\mathrm{sm}})$ are calculated. These values are stored in two lists, one for the hard cutoff results and one for the smooth cutoff results.\n\n3.  **Stability Calculation**: After processing all three $D_j$ values for a test case, the sets of results $\\{\\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{hard}}_j\\}_{j=1}^3$ and $\\{\\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{sm}}_j\\}_{j=1}^3$ are used to compute the relative instability metric $\\mathrm{var\\_rel}$ for both weight families.\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{var\\_rel}^{\\mathrm{hard}} = \\frac{\\max_j \\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{hard}}_j - \\min_j \\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{hard}}_j}{\\mathrm{mean}(\\{\\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{hard}}_j\\})} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathrm{var\\_rel}^{\\mathrm{sm}} = \\frac{\\max_j \\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{sm}}_j - \\min_j \\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{sm}}_j}{\\mathrm{mean}(\\{\\mathcal{U}^{\\mathrm{sm}}_j\\})}\n    $$\n    The boolean flag $\\mathrm{improved} = (\\mathrm{var\\_rel}^{\\mathrm{sm}} < \\mathrm{var\\_rel}^{\\mathrm{hard}})$ is determined.\n\n4.  **Aggregation**: The final triplet $[\\mathrm{var\\_rel}^{\\mathrm{hard}}, \\mathrm{var\\_rel}^{\\mathrm{sm}}, \\mathrm{improved}]$ is stored. This process is repeated for all four test cases, and the results are aggregated into a final list for output.\n\nThis design directly implements the specified mathematical framework and utilizes an efficient algorithm for the core numerical task, ensuring the computation is feasible within a reasonable time.
