No rounding is required, and no units are involved.", "solution": "The problem is divided into three tasks, which will be addressed sequentially.\n\n**Task 1: Construction of the Laplace–Stieltjes Transform**\n\nThe goal is to express the Laplace–Stieltjes transform $\\mathcal{L}\\{dA\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-s u)\\, dA(u)$ as a Dirichlet series. The function $A(u)$ is defined as $A(u) = \\psi(\\exp(u))$, where $\\psi(x) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\Lambda(n)$ is the Chebyshev function and $\\Lambda(n)$ is the von Mangoldt function. The domain is $u \\geq 0$ and $\\Re(s) > 1$.\n\nThe function $\\psi(x)$ is a step function which increases only at integer values of $x$. The jump at $x=n$ is given by $\\psi(n) - \\psi(n^-) = \\Lambda(n)$. Consequently, the function $A(u) = \\psi(\\exp(u))$ is also a step function. The jumps of $A(u)$ occur when $\\exp(u)$ passes an integer value $n$, which corresponds to $u = \\ln(n)$ for integers $n \\geq 1$. Note that for $n=1$, $u=\\ln(1)=0$, which is the lower bound of our integration domain.\n\nThe jump of $A(u)$ at $u_n = \\ln(n)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta A(\\ln(n)) = A(\\ln(n)) - A((\\ln n)^{-}) = \\psi(\\exp(\\ln n)) - \\psi(\\exp((\\ln n)^{-})) = \\psi(n) - \\psi(n^{-})\n$$\nBy the definition of the Chebyshev function, $\\psi(n) = \\sum_{k \\leq n} \\Lambda(k)$ and $\\psi(n^{-}) = \\lim_{x \\to n^{-}} \\psi(x) = \\sum_{k < n} \\Lambda(k)$. The difference is:\n$$\n\\psi(n) - \\psi(n^{-}) = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\Lambda(k)\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\Lambda(k)\\right) = \\Lambda(n)\n$$\nThe Riemann–Stieltjes integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(u) \\, dA(u)$ with a step function integrator $A(u)$ reduces to a sum over the points of discontinuity of $A(u)$. Each jump of size $\\Delta A(u_n)$ at a point $u_n$ contributes a term $f(u_n) \\Delta A(u_n)$ to the integral. In our case, $f(u) = \\exp(-su)$ and the jump points are $u_n = \\ln(n)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes a sum:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{dA\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-s u)\\, dA(u) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\exp(-s \\ln(n)) \\Lambda(n)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\exp(-s \\ln(n)) = (\\exp(\\ln n))^{-s} = n^{-s}$, we obtain the explicit Dirichlet series:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{dA\\}(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Lambda(n)}{n^s}\n$$\nThis is the desired construction. The condition $\\Re(s) > 1$ ensures the absolute convergence of this series.\n\n**Task 2: Properties of $A(u)$ and Relation to the Wiener–Ikehara Theorem**\n\nFirst, we prove that $A(u)$ is nondecreasing. Let $u_2 > u_1 \\geq 0$. Then $\\exp(u_2) > \\exp(u_1)$. The change in $A(u)$ is:\n$$\nA(u_2) - A(u_1) = \\psi(\\exp(u_2)) - \\psi(\\exp(u_1)) = \\sum_{\\exp(u_1) < n \\leq \\exp(u_2)} \\Lambda(n)\n$$\nThe von Mangoldt function is defined as $\\Lambda(n) = \\ln(p)$ if $n=p^k$ for a prime $p$ and integer $k \\geq 1$, and $\\Lambda(n)=0$ otherwise. Thus, $\\Lambda(n) \\geq 0$ for all $n \\geq 1$. As the sum consists of non-negative terms, $A(u_2) - A(u_1) \\geq 0$. Hence, $A(u)$ is a nondecreasing function.\n\nSecond, we prove that $A(u)$ is right-continuous. The Chebyshev function $\\psi(x) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\Lambda(n)$ is a step function that is constant on intervals $[n, n+1)$ and is defined to be right-continuous, i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to x^+} \\psi(t) = \\psi(x)$. The function $g(u) = \\exp(u)$ is continuous and strictly increasing. The function $A(u)$ is the composition $A(u) = \\psi(g(u))$. For any $u_0 \\geq 0$, as $u \\to u_0^+$, we have $g(u) \\to g(u_0)^+$. By the right-continuity of $\\psi$, we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to u_0^+} A(u) = \\lim_{u \\to u_0^+} \\psi(\\exp(u)) = \\psi(\\lim_{u \\to u_0^+} \\exp(u)) = \\psi(\\exp(u_0)) = A(u_0)\n$$\nThus, $A(u)$ is right-continuous for all $u \\geq 0$.\n\nA fundamental result in measure theory states that a nondecreasing, right-continuous function $F$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ determines a unique non-negative Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure $dF$ on the Borel sets such that $dF((a, b]) = F(b) - F(a)$. Since we have shown $A(u)$ is nondecreasing and right-continuous, it follows that $dA$ is a non-negative measure.\n\nThe non-negativity of the measure $dA$ (or equivalently, the nondecreasing nature of $A(u)$) is a critical hypothesis for the Wiener–Ikehara Tauberian theorem. The theorem provides a bridge from the analytic properties of the Laplace transform of a measure to the asymptotic properties of the measure itself. Specifically, it relates the behavior of $\\int_0^\\infty e^{-su} dA(u)$ near its abscissa of convergence to the asymptotic behavior of $\\int_0^u dA(t) = A(u)-A(0)$. The non-negativity condition prevents oscillatory behavior in $A(u)$ that could otherwise invalidate the Tauberian conclusion. It is this condition that allows one to deduce that $A(u) \\sim Cu$ from information about a pole of the transform at $s=1$.\n\n**Task 3: Residue Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the limit $L = \\lim_{s \\to 1^{+}} (s-1)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\Lambda(n)\\, n^{-s}$. This limit is precisely the residue of the function $F(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\Lambda(n)\\, n^{-s}$ at $s=1$.\n\nFrom Task 1, we have $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\Lambda(n)\\, n^{-s} = \\mathcal{L}\\{dA\\}(s)$. It is a standard result in the theory of the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ that for $\\Re(s) > 1$, its logarithmic derivative is related to the von Mangoldt function's Dirichlet series:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Lambda(n)}{n^s}\n$$\nThis identity arises from the Euler product representation of $\\zeta(s)$. Therefore, we need to evaluate:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{s \\to 1^{+}} (s-1) \\left(-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$. This implies that in a neighborhood of $s=1$, we can write $\\zeta(s)$ in the form:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\frac{1}{s-1} + h(s)\n$$\nwhere $h(s)$ is an analytic function at $s=1$. An equivalent representation is $\\zeta(s) = \\frac{g(s)}{s-1}$, where $g(s)$ is analytic at $s=1$ and $g(1) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1)\\zeta(s) = 1$.\n\nLet's compute the logarithmic derivative $\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}$ using this form:\n$$\n\\zeta'(s) = \\frac{g'(s)(s-1) - g(s)}{(s-1)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)} = \\frac{g'(s)(s-1) - g(s)}{(s-1)^2} \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{g(s)} = \\frac{g'(s)(s-1) - g(s)}{(s-1)g(s)} = \\frac{g'(s)}{g(s)} - \\frac{1}{s-1}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{g'(s)}{g(s)}$ is analytic at $s=1$ because $g(s)$ is analytic and $g(1)=1 \\neq 0$. This shows that $\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}$ has a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $-1$.\n\nThe function of interest is $-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}$. Its behavior near $s=1$ is:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)} = - \\left(\\frac{g'(s)}{g(s)} - \\frac{1}{s-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{s-1} - \\frac{g'(s)}{g(s)}\n$$\nThis function has a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$. The residue of a function $F(s)$ at a simple pole $s_0$ is given by $\\lim_{s \\to s_0} (s-s_0)F(s)$. Applying this definition to our problem:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{s \\to 1^{+}} (s-1) \\left(-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}\\right) = \\text{Res}_{s=1} \\left(-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}\\right) = 1\n$$\nAlternatively, evaluating the limit directly:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{s \\to 1^{+}} (s-1) \\left( \\frac{1}{s-1} - \\frac{g'(s)}{g(s)} \\right) = \\lim_{s \\to 1^{+}} \\left( 1 - (s-1)\\frac{g'(s)}{g(s)} \\right) = 1 - 0 \\cdot \\frac{g'(1)}{g(1)} = 1\n$$\nThe value of the limit is $1$.

This function is commonly denoted as $d(n)$ or $\\tau(n)$. By definition, $a_{n} = \\sum_{k|n, k>0} 1$. Let $u(n)$ be the arithmetic function that is identically $1$ for all $n \\geq 1$. The sum defining $a_n$ can be recognized as the Dirichlet convolution of the function $u(n)$ with itself:\n$$a_{n} = \\sum_{d|n} 1 \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{d|n} u(d) u(n/d) = (u * u)(n)$$\nThe problem defines the Dirichlet series $F(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_{n} n^{-s}$ for $\\Re s > 1$.\nA fundamental property of Dirichlet series states that for two arithmetic functions $f$ and $g$, the Dirichlet series of their convolution $f*g$ is the product of their individual Dirichlet series, provided they converge. That is, if $D(f,s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f(n)n^{-s}$ and $D(g,s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty g(n)n^{-s}$, then $D(f*g,s) = D(f,s)D(g,s)$.\nThe Dirichlet series for the function $u(n)=1$ is the Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$:\n$$\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 1 \\cdot n^{-s} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-s}$$\nThis series converges absolutely for $\\Re s > 1$.\nApplying the convolution property to $F(s)$, which is the Dirichlet series of $a_n = (u*u)(n)$, we get:\n$$F(s) = D(a_n, s) = D(u*u, s) = D(u,s) D(u,s) = (\\zeta(s))^{2}$$\nThus, for $\\Re s > 1$, we have shown that $F(s) = \\zeta(s)^{2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Laurent Expansion of $F(s)$ at $s=1$**\n\nWe need to analyze the behavior of $F(s) = \\zeta(s)^{2}$ near the point $s=1$. The Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ is known to have a simple pole at $s=1$. Its Laurent series expansion about $s=1$ is given by:\n$$\\zeta(s) = \\frac{1}{s-1} + \\gamma + O(s-1)$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\nTo find the Laurent expansion for $F(s)$, we square the expansion for $\\zeta(s)$:\n$$F(s) = \\zeta(s)^{2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{s-1} + \\gamma + O(s-1) \\right)^{2}$$\nExpanding the expression yields:\n$$F(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s-1}\\right)^{2} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-1} \\cdot \\gamma + \\gamma^{2} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-1} \\cdot O(s-1) + \\text{other terms}$$\nLet's analyze the terms:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The leading term is $\\frac{1}{(s-1)^{2}}$.\n    \\item The next term is $\\frac{2\\gamma}{s-1}$.\n    \\item The term $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-1} \\cdot O(s-1)$ simplifies to $O(1)$, as $O(s-1)$ represents a function bounded by $K|s-1|$ for some constant $K$, so their product is bounded.\n\\end{itemize}\nCombining these, the Laurent series for $F(s)$ about $s=1$ begins:\n$$F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-1)^{2}} + \\frac{2\\gamma}{s-1} + O(1)$$\nThis expansion demonstrates that $F(s)$ has a pole of order $2$ (a double pole) at $s=1$.

Let $F(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n n^{-s}$ where $a_n \\geq 0$ for all $n$.

Since $d(n) \\ge 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$, the non-negativity condition $a_n \\geq 0$ is satisfied. From Part 2, we established that $F(s)$ has a pole of order $k=2$ at $s=1$. The coefficient of the $(s-1)^{-2}$ term was found to be $c=1$. Therefore, $C=c=1$.\n\nThe problem states that the asymptotic behavior is of the form $A(x) \\sim c \\, x \\log x$.

The function $(s-1)^2 F(s) = (s-1)^2 \\zeta(s)^2 = ((s-1)\\zeta(s))^2$ is analytic for $\\Re s \\ge 1$ because $(s-1)\\zeta(s)$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $s=1$ (and in fact for $\\Re s > 0$).\n\nThe value of the constant $c$, which is the coefficient of the $(s-1)^{-2}$ term in the Laurent expansion of $F(s)$ at $s=1$, was determined in Part 2 to be $1$.\nTherefore, the asymptotic behavior of the summatory divisor function is $A(x) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} d(n) \\sim x \\log x$.

The coefficients of the series are given by $a_n = 1 - 2\\cos(\\alpha \\ln n)$. We use Euler's formula, $\\cos(x) = \\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}$, to rewrite $a_n$:\n$$\na_n = 1 - 2 \\left( \\frac{e^{i\\alpha \\ln n} + e^{-i\\alpha \\ln n}}{2} \\right) = 1 - e^{i\\alpha \\ln n} - e^{-i\\alpha \\ln n}.\n$$\nUsing the identity $e^{x \\ln y} = y^x$, we can write $e^{i\\alpha \\ln n} = n^{i\\alpha}$ and $e^{-i\\alpha \\ln n} = n^{-i\\alpha}$. Therefore, the coefficient $a_n$ is:\n$$\na_n = 1 - n^{i\\alpha} - n^{-i\\alpha}.\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $a_n$ into the definition of the Dirichlet series $F(s)$:\n$$\nF(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - n^{i\\alpha} - n^{-i\\alpha}) n^{-s}.\n$$\nFor $\\Re(s) > 1$, the series converges absolutely, allowing us to split the sum into three separate series:\n$$\nF(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-s} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{i\\alpha} n^{-s} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-i\\alpha} n^{-s}.\n$$\nWe can combine the exponents in the second and third series:\n$$\nF(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-s} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-(s-i\\alpha)} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-(s+i\\alpha)}.\n$$\nEach of these series is a Riemann zeta function with a shifted argument. The Riemann zeta function is defined as $\\zeta(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-z}$ for $\\Re(z) > 1$. Thus, we can express $F(s)$ as:\n$$\nF(s) = \\zeta(s) - \\zeta(s - i\\alpha) - \\zeta(s + i\\alpha).\n$$\nThis relationship is valid for $\\Re(s) > 1$, since if $\\Re(s) > 1$, then $\\Re(s-i\\alpha) = \\Re(s) > 1$ and $\\Re(s+i\\alpha) = \\Re(s) > 1$, ensuring the convergence of all three zeta functions.\n\nThe problem asks for the singular (purely atomic) part of the boundary value of $F(s)$ on the line $\\Re(s)=1$. This boundary value is obtained by considering the limit of $F(1+\\sigma+it)$ as $\\sigma \\to 0^+$ in the sense of tempered distributions in the variable $t$. The singularities of $F(s)$ on the line $\\Re(s)=1$ are inherited from the singularities of the zeta functions in its expression.\n\nThe Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(z)$ is analytic over the entire complex plane, except for a simple pole at $z=1$ with residue $1$.\nBased on the expression for $F(s)$, its poles on the line $\\Re(s)=1$ are determined as follows:\n1.  The term $\\zeta(s)$ contributes a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$.\n2.  The term $-\\zeta(s-i\\alpha)$ contributes a simple pole where $s-i\\alpha=1$, i.e., at $s=1+i\\alpha$. The residue of $\\zeta(s-i\\alpha)$ at this pole is $1$, so the residue of $-\\zeta(s-i\\alpha)$ is $-1$.\n3.  The term $-\\zeta(s+i\\alpha)$ contributes a simple pole where $s+i\\alpha=1$, i.e., at $s=1-i\\alpha$. The residue of $\\zeta(s+i\\alpha)$ at this pole is $1$, so the residue of $-\\zeta(s+i\\alpha)$ is $-1$.\n\nSince $\\alpha \\in (0, \\infty)$ is given, these three poles at $s=1$, $s=1+i\\alpha$, and $s=1-i\\alpha$ are distinct.\n\nThe connection between a simple pole of an analytic function and the atomic part of its boundary distribution is a standard result from distribution theory, often derived from the properties of the Cauchy kernel (related to the Sokhotski-Plemelj theorem). If a function $G(s)$ has an isolated simple pole at $s_0 = x_0 + iy_0$ with residue $c$, then the limit in the sense of distributions of its evaluation on the line $s = x_0 + \\sigma + it$ as $\\sigma \\to 0^+$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\sigma \\to 0^+} G(x_0+\\sigma+it) = c\\pi\\delta(t-y_0) + \\text{(a principal value distribution)}.\n$$\nThe problem asks specifically for the purely atomic part, which is the term involving the Dirac delta function $\\delta$.\n\nWe apply this principle to $F(s)$ on the line $\\Re(s)=1$, for which $x_0=1$.\n- **Pole at $s=1$**: Here, $y_0 = 0$. The residue of $F(s)$ at this pole is the residue of $\\zeta(s)$, which is $c=1$. The contribution to the singular part of the boundary distribution is $1 \\cdot \\pi\\delta(t-0) = \\pi\\delta(t)$.\n\n- **Pole at $s=1+i\\alpha$**: Here, $y_0 = \\alpha$. The residue of $F(s)$ at this pole is the residue of $-\\zeta(s-i\\alpha)$, which is $c=-1$. The contribution to the singular part is $(-1) \\cdot \\pi\\delta(t-\\alpha) = -\\pi\\delta(t-\\alpha)$.\n\n- **Pole at $s=1-i\\alpha$**: Here, $y_0 = -\\alpha$. The residue of $F(s)$ at this pole is the residue of $-\\zeta(s+i\\alpha)$, which is $c=-1$. The contribution to the singular part is $(-1) \\cdot \\pi\\delta(t-(-\\alpha)) = -\\pi\\delta(t+\\alpha)$.\n\nThe total singular (purely atomic) part of the boundary distribution of $F(1+it)$ is the sum of these individual contributions:\n$$\n\\text{Singular Part} = \\pi\\delta(t) - \\pi\\delta(t-\\alpha) - \\pi\\delta(t+\\alpha).\n$$\nThis can be written in a more compact form:\n$$\n\\pi(\\delta(t) - \\delta(t-\\alpha) - \\delta(t+\\alpha)).\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the singular part of the tempered-distribution boundary value of $F(s)$ on the line $\\Re(s)=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi(\\delta(t) - \\delta(t-\\alpha) - \\delta(t+\\alpha))}\n$$"}]}
