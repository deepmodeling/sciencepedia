This exercise provides hands-on practice in building such a character from the ground up, using its local properties modulo prime power divisors of the conductor. By synthesizing these local definitions via the Chinese Remainder Theorem, you will gain a deeper intuition for the structure of the character group and the meaning of primitivity [@problem_id:3023916].", "problem": "Let $q=60$. Using only the definitions of Dirichlet characters, quadratic residues, the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)$, the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{D}{n}\\right)$, and the Chinese remainder theorem, construct explicitly a real primitive Dirichlet character modulo $q$ by prescribing its local quadratic-residue behavior modulo $4$, $3$, and $5$ and then combining these prescriptions via the Chinese remainder theorem. Your construction must begin by specifying a set of residue-class conditions modulo $4$, $3$, and $5$ that determines whether a given integer $n$ with $\\gcd(n,60)=1$ is mapped to $1$ or $-1$.

The final answer must be a single closed-form expression and must not include any inequalities or equations other than the definition of the character itself.", "solution": "The problem requires the explicit construction of a real primitive Dirichlet character modulo $q=60$. The construction must be based on specifying its local behavior modulo the prime power factors of $60$, which are $4$, $3$, and $5$. We must then prove the resulting character is well-defined, completely multiplicative, and primitive, and finally express it in a closed form using the Kronecker symbol with a fundamental discriminant.\n\nFirst, we factorize the modulus $q=60$ into its prime power components: $q = 60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group of reduced residue classes modulo $60$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/60\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is isomorphic to the direct product of the reduced residue class groups modulo $4$, $3$, and $5$:\n$$(\\mathbb{Z}/60\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$$\nThis isomorphism induces a corresponding isomorphism on the groups of Dirichlet characters. Any character $\\chi$ modulo $60$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_3 \\chi_5$, where $\\chi_4, \\chi_3, \\chi_5$ are Dirichlet characters modulo $4, 3,$ and $5$, respectively.\n\nFor the character $\\chi$ to be a *real* character, its values must be restricted to $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. This requires each of its component characters $\\chi_4, \\chi_3, \\chi_5$ to be real.\nFor the character $\\chi$ to be *primitive* with conductor $60$, its conductor $f(\\chi)$ must be equal to $60$. The conductor of a product of characters with pairwise coprime moduli is the product of their individual conductors. Thus, we must have $f(\\chi) = f(\\chi_4)f(\\chi_3)f(\\chi_5) = 60$. This implies that each component character must be primitive with respect to its own modulus, i.e., $f(\\chi_4)=4$, $f(\\chi_3)=3$, and $f(\\chi_5)=5$.\n\nWe now identify the unique real primitive character for each modulus:\n1.  **Modulo 4**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has two elements, $\\{1, 3\\}$. There is one non-principal character, $\\chi_4$, defined by $\\chi_4(1)=1$ and $\\chi_4(3)=-1$. For an odd integer $n$, $\\chi_4(n) = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}$. This is the unique primitive character modulo $4$, so its conductor is $f(\\chi_4)=4$.\n2.  **Modulo 3**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has two elements, $\\{1, 2\\}$. The unique non-principal character, $\\chi_3$, is given by the Legendre symbol: $\\chi_3(n) = \\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)$. This character is primitive, with conductor $f(\\chi_3)=3$.\n3.  **Modulo 5**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $4$. It has one real, non-principal character, $\\chi_5$, given by the Legendre symbol: $\\chi_5(n) = \\left(\\frac{n}{5}\\right)$. This character is primitive, with conductor $f(\\chi_5)=5$.\n\nFollowing the problem's prescription, we define a map $\\chi$ for any integer $n$ with $\\gcd(n,60)=1$. The value $\\chi(n)$ is determined by the residue class of $n$ modulo $4$, $3$, and $5$. Specifically, we define $\\chi(n)$ as the product of the values of these three local primitive characters:\n$$\\chi(n) = \\chi_4(n) \\chi_3(n) \\chi_5(n) = (-1)^{(n-1)/2} \\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n}{5}\\right)$$\nWe extend this to all integers $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ by setting $\\chi(n)=0$ if $\\gcd(n,60) \\neq 1$. This defines our candidate Dirichlet character.\n\nWe now prove its properties.\n*   **Well-defined on residue classes modulo 60**: Let $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $n_1 \\equiv n_2 \\pmod{60}$. If $\\gcd(n_1, 60) \\neq 1$, then $\\gcd(n_2, 60) \\neq 1$, so $\\chi(n_1) = \\chi(n_2) = 0$. If $\\gcd(n_1, 60) = 1$, then $n_1 \\equiv n_2 \\pmod 4$, $n_1 \\equiv n_2 \\pmod 3$, and $n_1 \\equiv n_2 \\pmod 5$. Since $\\chi_4$, $\\chi_3$, and $\\chi_5$ are well-defined characters modulo $4$, $3$, and $5$ respectively, we have $\\chi_4(n_1) = \\chi_4(n_2)$, $\\chi_3(n_1)=\\chi_3(n_2)$, and $\\chi_5(n_1)=\\chi_5(n_2)$. Therefore, their product $\\chi(n_1)$ must equal $\\chi(n_2)$. The character is well-defined.\n\n*   **Completely Multiplicative**: We must show $\\chi(ab) = \\chi(a)\\chi(b)$ for all integers $a,b$. If $\\gcd(a,60)\\neq 1$ or $\\gcd(b,60)\\neq 1$, then $\\gcd(ab,60)\\neq 1$. In this case, $\\chi(ab)=0$ and at least one of $\\chi(a)$ or $\\chi(b)$ is zero, so the equality holds. If $\\gcd(a,60)=1$ and $\\gcd(b,60)=1$, then all component characters are completely multiplicative: $\\chi_d(ab) = \\chi_d(a)\\chi_d(b)$ for $d \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$.\n    \\begin{align*} \\chi(ab) &= \\chi_4(ab)\\chi_3(ab)\\chi_5(ab) \\\\ &= (\\chi_4(a)\\chi_4(b))(\\chi_3(a)\\chi_3(b))(\\chi_5(a)\\chi_5(b)) \\\\ &= (\\chi_4(a)\\chi_3(a)\\chi_5(a))(\\chi_4(b)\\chi_3(b)\\chi_5(b)) \\\\ &= \\chi(a)\\chi(b) \\end{align*}\n    Thus, $\\chi$ is a completely multiplicative function.\n\n*   **Primitive with conductor 60**: As established during the construction, $\\chi$ is the product of three primitive characters $\\chi_4, \\chi_3, \\chi_5$ with pairwise coprime moduli $4, 3, 5$. The conductor of the product is the product of the individual conductors: $f(\\chi) = f(\\chi_4)f(\\chi_3)f(\\chi_5) = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60$. Since the conductor $60$ is equal to the modulus, the character $\\chi$ is primitive.\n\nFinally, we express $\\chi(n)$ as a single closed form using the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{D}{n}\\right)$ for a fundamental discriminant $D$. A real primitive character of conductor $f$ can be uniquely written as $\\left(\\frac{D}{\\cdot}\\right)$ where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant with $|D|=f$.\nWe can express each local character using the Kronecker symbol:\n*   $\\chi_4(n) = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}$. For positive odd $n$, this is $\\left(\\frac{-1}{n}\\right)$. The character $\\left(\\frac{-4}{n}\\right)$ is defined as $0$ if $n$ is even, $1$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and $-1$ if $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This matches $\\chi_4(n)$. The discriminant is $D_1=-4$, which is fundamental.\n*   $\\chi_3(n) = \\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)$. By the law of quadratic reciprocity, for $n>0$ with $\\gcd(n,3)=1$, $\\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{n}\\right)(-1)^{((3-1)/2)((n-1)/2)} = \\left(\\frac{3}{n}\\right)(-1)^{(n-1)/2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{-1}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-3}{n}\\right)$. So $\\chi_3(n) = \\left(\\frac{-3}{n}\\right)$. The discriminant $D_2=-3$ is fundamental as $-3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and is square-free.\n*   $\\chi_5(n) = \\left(\\frac{n}{5}\\right)$. By quadratic reciprocity, for $n>0$ with $\\gcd(n,5)=1$, $\\left(\\frac{n}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{n}\\right)(-1)^{((5-1)/2)((n-1)/2)} = \\left(\\frac{5}{n}\\right)(-1)^{2((n-1)/2)} = \\left(\\frac{5}{n}\\right)$. So $\\chi_5(n) = \\left(\\frac{5}{n}\\right)$. The discriminant $D_3=5$ is fundamental as $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and is square-free.\n\nCombining these using the multiplicative property of the Kronecker symbol's numerator:\n$$\\chi(n) = \\left(\\frac{-4}{n}\\right) \\left(\\frac{-3}{n}\\right) \\left(\\frac{5}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{(-4)(-3)(5)}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{60}{n}\\right)$$\nThe discriminant is $D=60$. We verify that $D=60$ is a fundamental discriminant. We write $60 = 4 \\cdot 15$. Here, $15$ is square-free and $15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This matches the definition of a fundamental discriminant of the form $4k$. The conductor of the character $\\left(\\frac{60}{\\cdot}\\right)$ is $|60|=60$, which confirms our earlier finding.\n\nThus, the constructed real primitive character modulo $60$ is given by the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{60}{n}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{60}{n}\\right)}$$", "id": "3023916"}, {"introduction": "One of the most profound connections in number theory is the link between the analytic behavior of $L$-functions and the algebraic structure of number fields, encapsulated in the analytic class number formula.
