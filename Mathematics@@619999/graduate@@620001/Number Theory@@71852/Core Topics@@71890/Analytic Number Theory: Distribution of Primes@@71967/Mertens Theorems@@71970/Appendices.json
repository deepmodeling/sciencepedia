This is a direct application of Mertens' third theorem, which we will now derive from the specified first principles.\n\nLet $y > 1$ be a real number. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the product $P(y) = \\prod_{p\\le y}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p}\\right)$ for large $y$. The problem asks for the case where $y=x^\\alpha$.\n\nWe begin by taking the natural logarithm of $P(y)$:\n$$\n\\ln P(y) = \\ln\\left(\\prod_{p\\le y}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p}\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{p\\le y}\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p}\\right).\n$$\nUsing the Taylor series $\\ln(1-u) = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^k}{k}$ for $|u|1$ with $u=1/p$, we can split the sum:\n$$\n\\ln P(y) = \\sum_{p\\le y}\\left(-\\frac{1}{p} - \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k p^k}\\right) = -\\left(\\sum_{p\\le y}\\frac{1}{p}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{p\\le y}\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k p^k}\\right).\n$$\nLet's analyze the two terms on the right-hand side as $y \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe first term is the subject of Mertens' second theorem:\n$$\n\\sum_{p\\le y}\\frac{1}{p} = \\ln(\\ln y) + M + o(1),\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the Meissel-Mertens constant ($M \\approx 0.261$).\n\nThe second term's inner sum is $\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k p^k} = -\\ln(1-1/p) - 1/p$. Because this is $O(1/p^2)$, the sum over all primes converges absolutely. Let's call the limit of the full second term $S$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{p}\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k p^k}.\n$$\nThis constant $S$ is positive, and as $y\\to\\infty$, the second term approaches $S$.\n\nCombining these results, the asymptotic behavior of $\\ln P(y)$ is:\n$$\n\\ln P(y) = -(\\ln(\\ln y) + M + o(1)) - (S + o(1)) = -\\ln(\\ln y) - M - S + o(1).\n$$\nThe crucial step, as suggested by the problem's reference to the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ and the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\\gamma$, is to identify the constant term $-M-S$. Deeper analysis originating from the Laurent expansion of $\\zeta(s)$ at its pole $s=1$ (where $\\zeta(s) = \\frac{1}{s-1} + \\gamma + O(s-1)$) shows that the asymptotic for the prime product sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{p\\le y}\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p}\\right) = -\\ln(\\ln y) - \\gamma + o(1).\n$$\nBy comparing our two asymptotic expressions for $\\ln P(y)$, we must have:\n$$\n-M - S = -\\gamma \\quad \\implies \\quad M + S = \\gamma.\n$$\nThis fundamental identity ($0.261... + 0.315... \\approx 0.577...$) connects the Meissel-Mertens constant $M$ (from sums over primes) and the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\\gamma$ (from sums over all integers), with the constant $S$ representing the contribution from higher powers of primes.\n\nUsing this result, we have established that $\\ln P(y) = -\\ln(\\ln y) - \\gamma + o(1)$.

The setup is sufficiently complete for an individual with the expected background in number theory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option-by-option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of two arithmetic sums, $S_{p}(x) = \\sum_{p \\le x} 1/p$ and $S_{\\mu}(x) = \\sum_{n \\le x} \\mu(n)/n$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\nStatement: As $x \\to \\infty$, one has $S_{p}(x) = \\log \\log x + B + O(1/\\log x)$ for some real constant $B$, whereas $S_{\\mu}(x) = o(1)$.\n\n1.  The asymptotic for $S_{p}(x)$: This is a precise statement of Mertens' second theorem. The constant $B$ is the Meissel-Mertens constant, given by $B = \\gamma + \\sum_{p} (\\log(1 - 1/p) + 1/p)$. The formula is a cornerstone result in the study of prime numbers. This part of the statement is correct.\n\n2.  The asymptotic for $S_{\\mu}(x)$: The Dirichlet series for $1/\\zeta(s)$ is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mu(n)n^{-s}$. The Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=1$. This implies that $1/\\zeta(s)$ is analytic at $s=1$ and has a simple zero there, i.e., $\\lim_{s \\to 1^+} 1/\\zeta(s) = 0$. By a standard result connecting the convergence of a Dirichlet series at a point to the summations of its coefficients (a Tauberian theorem is not strictly necessary here, as this result can be derived from the Prime Number Theorem), the convergence of the series to $0$ at $s=1$ implies that the partial sums converge to $0$. Specifically, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mu(n)/n = 0$. Therefore, $S_{\\mu}(x) = \\sum_{n \\le x} \\mu(n)/n$ converges to $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. The notation $S_{\\mu}(x) = o(1)$ is equivalent to the statement $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} S_{\\mu}(x) = 0$. This part of the statement is also correct.\n\nSince both components of the statement are correct, option A is correct.\nVerdict on A: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\nStatement: The partial sums $S_{\\mu}(x)$ converge to a strictly positive limit equal to the infinite product $\\prod_{p} (1 - 1/p)$.\n\nAs established in the analysis of Option A, $S_{\\mu}(x)$ converges to $0$. The statement claims convergence to a *strictly positive* limit, which is false. Furthermore, the infinite product $\\prod_{p} (1 - 1/p)$ diverges to $0$. This can be seen from Mertens' third theorem (see Option C), which states that the partial product $\\prod_{p \\le x} (1 - 1/p) \\sim e^{-\\gamma}/\\log x$, which tends to $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. Thus, the value of the limit stated is $0$, not a strictly positive number. The statement is incorrect on two counts.\nVerdict on B: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\nStatement: The partial Euler product over primes satisfies $\\prod_{p \\le x} (1 - 1/p) \\sim \\frac{e^{-\\gamma}}{\\log x}$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThis is the precise statement of Mertens' third theorem. The symbol $\\sim$ denotes that the ratio of the two sides tends to $1$ as $x \\to \\infty$. The constant $e^{-\\gamma}$ and the asymptotic dependence on $1/\\log x$ are correct.\nVerdict on C: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\nStatement: Unconditionally, one has $S_{\\mu}(x) \\to 0$ and, using Abel summation together with a classical zero-free region for $\\zeta(s)$, there exists a constant $c  0$ such that $S_{\\mu}(x) = O(\\exp(-c\\,(\\log x)^{3/5} (\\log \\log x)^{-1/5}))$.\n\n1.  The first part, $S_{\\mu}(x) \\to 0$, is correct, as discussed for Option A. This result is known to be equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem (PNT).\n\n2.  The second part provides a specific error term (rate of convergence) for $S_{\\mu}(x)$. The error term in the PNT is intrinsically linked to the size of the zero-free region for $\\zeta(s)$ to the left of the line $\\operatorname{Re}(s)=1$. The classical Vinogradov-Korobov zero-free region is the best known unconditionally, which leads to the error term for the Mertens function $M(x) = O(x \\exp(-c_1 (\\log x)^{3/5} (\\log \\log x)^{-1/5}))$. The rate of convergence of $S_{\\mu}(x) = \\sum_{n \\le x} \\mu(n)/n$ to its limit $0$ can be related to the bound on $M(x)$ via Abel summation. Specifically, $S_{\\mu}(x) = -\\sum_{n  x} \\mu(n)/n$. Bounding this tail sum using the known bound on $M(x)$ yields an error term of the same form. This is a standard, albeit advanced, unconditional result in analytic number theory.\nVerdict on D: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\nStatement: The leading constant that appears in the asymptotic for $S_{p}(x)$ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant $\\gamma$.\n\nThe asymptotic expansion for $S_p(x)$, from Mertens' second theorem, is $S_{p}(x) = \\log \\log x + B + O(1/\\log x)$. The term \"leading constant\" is ambiguous. It could refer to the coefficient of the leading term $\\log \\log x$, which is $1$. Or it could refer to the constant $B$ which is the next term in the expansion. In neither case is the constant equal to $\\gamma$. The constant $B$ is the Meissel-Mertens constant, $B \\approx 0.261497...$, while $\\gamma \\approx 0.577215...$. While $\\gamma$ is used to define $B$ (as $B = \\gamma + \\sum_p [\\log(1-1/p) + 1/p]$), $B$ itself is not equal to $\\gamma$. Thus, the statement is not accurate.\nVerdict on E: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option F**\nStatement: Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one has $S_{\\mu}(x) = O(x^{-1/2+\\varepsilon})$ for every fixed $\\varepsilon  0$.\n\nThe Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to the statement that for every $\\varepsilon  0$, the Mertens function satisfies $M(x) = O(x^{1/2+\\varepsilon})$. We can relate the bound on $M(x)$ to a bound on $S_{\\mu}(x)$ using Abel summation. The identity is $S_{\\mu}(x) = \\frac{M(x)}{x} + \\int_1^x \\frac{M(t)}{t^2} dt$.\nAssuming RH, we have:\n- $|\\frac{M(x)}{x}| \\le \\frac{C_{\\varepsilon} x^{1/2+\\varepsilon}}{x} = C_{\\varepsilon} x^{-1/2+\\varepsilon}$.\n- $|\\int_1^x \\frac{M(t)}{t^2} dt - C| = |\\int_x^\\infty \\frac{M(t)}{t^2} dt| \\le \\int_x^\\infty \\frac{C_{\\varepsilon} t^{1/2+\\varepsilon}}{t^2} dt = C_{\\varepsilon} \\int_x^\\infty t^{-3/2+\\varepsilon} dt = \\frac{C_{\\varepsilon}}{1/2-\\varepsilon} x^{-1/2+\\varepsilon}$, for $\\varepsilon  1/2$. The constant $C$ is $\\int_1^\\infty M(t)/t^2 dt$.\nSince we know $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} S_\\mu(x) = 0$, the constant $C$ must be $0$.\nCombining the terms, we find that $S_{\\mu}(x) = O(x^{-1/2+\\varepsilon})$.
