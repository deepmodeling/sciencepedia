This is the ring of integers of the quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. As the ring of integers of a number field, $R$ is a Dedekind domain, which means every non-zero proper ideal has a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals.\n\nThe factorization of a rational prime ideal $(p)$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is determined by the behavior of the minimal polynomial of the generator of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ modulo $p$. For $R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$, the element $\\omega$ satisfies the minimal polynomial $x^2 - x + 1 = 0$. The ring can be described as $R \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2 - x + 1)$.\n\nTo understand the factorization of the ideal $(2)$, we consider the quotient ring $R/(2)$:\n$$R/(2) \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2-x+1)}{(2)} \\cong \\frac{(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})[x]}{(x^2-x+1)}$$\nIn the field with two elements, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, addition and subtraction are the same, so the polynomial $x^2-x+1$ becomes $x^2+x+1$.\n\nThe structure of the ideal $(2)$ in $R$ depends on the factorization of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2+x+1$ over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nWe test for roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n-   $f(0) = 0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0$\n-   $f(1) = 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 \\neq 0$\nSince $f(x)$ is a degree-$2$ polynomial with no roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nAccording to a fundamental theorem in algebraic number theory (Dedekind-Kummer theorem), because the polynomial $x^2+x+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the ideal $(2)$ is a prime ideal in $R$. Such a prime is called inert.\n\nSince $(2)$ is a prime ideal in $R$, its factorization into prime ideals is simply $(2)$ itself.\n\nThe problem asks whether the element $2 \\in R$ is a prime element. An element $p$ in a commutative ring with unity is prime if the principal ideal $(p)$ is a non-zero prime ideal. Since we have established that $(2)$ is a prime ideal in $R$, the element $2$ is, by definition, a prime element in $R$. (Note: In $R$, which is a principal ideal domain (PID), the concepts of prime and irreducible elements coincide. One could also show $2$ is irreducible by demonstrating it has no non-trivial factors, which can be done using norms. The norm of an element $a+b\\omega$ is $N(a+b\\omega) = a^2+ab+b^2$. If $2=\\alpha\\beta$ for non-units $\\alpha, \\beta \\in R$, then $N(2)=N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$, so $4=N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$. Since $\\alpha, \\beta$ are not units, $N(\\alpha)>1$ and $N(\\beta)>1$, forcing $N(\\alpha)=N(\\beta)=2$. However, the equation $a^2+ab+b^2=2$ has no integer solutions for $a$ and $b$, so no element of norm $2$ exists. Thus, $2$ is irreducible and hence prime.)\n\nFinally, we must determine the ramification index $e$. The problem gives the general form for the decomposition of $(2)$ as $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}^e$, where $\\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal and $e$ is the ramification index. This form implies that the ideal $(2)$ is a power of a single prime ideal, which is true for both inert and totally ramified primes.\n\nFor our case, where $(2)$ is an inert prime ideal, the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ in the factorization is the ideal $(2)$ itself. The factorization is thus:\n$$(2) = (2)^1$$\nBy comparing this to the given form $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}^e$, we identify:\n-   The prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (2)$.\n-   The ramification index $e = 1$.\n\nThe general relation for factorization is $\\sum_{i=1}^{g} e_i f_i = n$, where $g$ is the number of distinct prime ideal factors, $e_i$ are the ramification indices, $f_i$ are the inertia degrees, and $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the degree of the field extension.\nFor an inert prime, $g=1$. We have found $e=1$. The degree of the extension $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n=2$. Thus, $e \\cdot f = 1 \\cdot f = 2$, which implies the inertia degree is $f=2$. This is consistent, as the quotient ring $R/(2)$ is a field extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ of degree $2$.\n\nThe specific value requested by the problem is the ramification index $e$. From our analysis, $e=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3021484"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the factorization of individual ideals, we now ascend to a more global perspective: the structure of the ideal class group, $\\mathrm{Cl}_{K}$.
