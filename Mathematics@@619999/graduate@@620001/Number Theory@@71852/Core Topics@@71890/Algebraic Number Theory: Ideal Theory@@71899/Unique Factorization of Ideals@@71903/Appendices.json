The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two ideals is the unique ideal whose exponents in the prime ideal factorization are the minimum of the corresponding exponents of the two, and the least common multiple (lcm) is defined analogously with maximum exponents.\n\nWe first recall the prime ideal factorization behavior of the rational primes $2$ and $3$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. The discriminant of $K$ is $D_K = -20$. The prime $2$ divides the discriminant and ramifies. The prime $3$ does not divide the discriminant, so it is unramified.

This is equivalent to $m-5n$ and $m+n$ both being even, which holds if and only if $m$ and $n$ have the same parity (i.e., $m \\equiv n \\pmod 2$).\n\nSo, $I^{-1} = \\left\\{ \\frac{m+n\\sqrt{-5}}{2} \\mid m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, m \\equiv n \\pmod 2 \\right\\}$.\nTo find a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis, consider an element $x \\in I^{-1}$.

The distinct residue classes can be represented by $0$ and $1$.\nWe must check that $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod I$, i.e., $1 \\notin I$. If $1 \\in I$, then $1 = 2\\alpha + (1+\\sqrt{-5})\\beta$ for some $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. Taking the norm of both sides would not be simple. Instead, let $\\alpha=a_1+b_1\\sqrt{-5}$ and $\\beta=a_2+b_2\\sqrt{-5}$.\n$1 = 2(a_1+b_1\\sqrt{-5}) + (1+\\sqrt{-5})(a_2+b_2\\sqrt{-5}) = (2a_1 + a_2 - 5b_2) + (2b_1 + a_2 + b_2)\\sqrt{-5}$.\nEquating coefficients gives a system over the integers: $2a_1+a_2-5b_2 = 1$ and $2b_1+a_2+b_2 = 0$. Subtracting the second from the first gives $2a_1 - 2b_1 - 6b_2 = 1$, or $2(a_1-b_1-3b_2)=1$. This equation has no integer solutions, as an even number cannot equal $1$. Thus, $1 \\notin I$.\nThe quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/I$ has exactly two elements, $\\{[0], [1]\\}$.
