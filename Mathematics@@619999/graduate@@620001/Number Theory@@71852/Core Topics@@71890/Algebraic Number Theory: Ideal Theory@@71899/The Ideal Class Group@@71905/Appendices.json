The class of $\\mathfrak{j}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{-1}$, so the class of $\\mathfrak{j}^{-1}$ is $\\mathcal{C}$.

Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be any ideal class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. From the result just derived, we know there must exist an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le M_K$. By the hypothesis, this ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ must be principal. If $\\mathfrak{a}$ is principal, its ideal class $[\\mathfrak{a}]$ is the identity element of $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. Since $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathcal{C}$, we have $[\\mathfrak{a}]=\\mathcal{C}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{C}$ is the identity class. As $\\mathcal{C}$ was an arbitrary class, this implies all classes are the identity class, and so $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ is the trivial group, which means the class number $h_K = 1$.\n\nFinally, we apply this framework to $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis is a quadratic field, so its degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n=2$. The minimal polynomial is $x^2-2=0$, whose roots are $\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$. Both are real, so there are $r_1=2$ real embeddings and $r_2=0$ pairs of complex embeddings.

The norm of a nonzero integral ideal is a positive integer.

The field is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d = -5$. Since $d \\equiv -5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is given by $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.

The norm of such an element is $N(a + b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the discriminant of the field $K$. For a field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ square-free and $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, the discriminant is $d_K = 4d$. In our case, $d = -5$, so the discriminant is $d_K = 4(-5) = -20$.\n\nMinkowski's theorem states that every ideal class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ whose norm $N(\\mathfrak{a})$ satisfies the inequality:\n$$N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le M_K = \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\sqrt{|d_K|}$$\nFor the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, the degree of the extension is $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. As an imaginary quadratic field, it has $r_1 = 0$ real embeddings and $r_2 = 1$ pair of complex conjugate embeddings.

Therefore, we only need to examine the prime ideals lying above the rational primes $p$ such that $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\le M_K$. Since the norm of a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ lying above a rational prime $p$ is of the form $p^f$ for some integer $f \\ge 1$, we only need to consider rational primes $p \\le 2$.\n\nThe ideals to consider are those with norm $1$ or $2$.\nAn ideal of norm $1$ is unique: it is the ring $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ itself, which is the principal ideal $(1)$. This ideal represents the identity element in the ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$.\n\nNext, we consider ideals of norm $2$. To find these, we must examine the factorization of the ideal $(2)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. We use Dedekind's theorem on the factorization of primes. The minimal polynomial of the generator $\\sqrt{-5}$ is $f(x) = x^2 + 5$. We consider this polynomial modulo the prime $p=2$:\n$$x^2 + 5 \\equiv x^2 + 1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod{2}$$\nSince the polynomial has a repeated root $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, the prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The ideal $(2)$ factors as the square of a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, i.e., $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2$. The ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is given by $(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$.\nThe norm of this ideal is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = \\sqrt{N((2))} = \\sqrt{N(2)} = \\sqrt{2^2} = 2$. Thus, there is exactly one ideal of norm $2$, namely $\\mathfrak{p}_2$.\n\nThe ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ is generated by the classes of the prime ideals with norm less than or equal to the Minkowski bound $M_K$. In our case, the only such prime ideal that could potentially be non-principal is $\\mathfrak{p}_2$. Therefore, the class group is generated by the class of $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, denoted $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\n\nTo determine the structure of the class group, we must find the order of the element $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. The order is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}_2^k$ is a principal ideal.\nFrom the ramification, we know that $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2)$. The ideal $(2)$ is generated by the element $2 \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$, so it is a principal ideal. This implies that in the class group, $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [(2)] = [1]$, where $[1]$ is the identity element. This shows that the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is at most $2$.\n\nThe order is exactly $2$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not itself a principal ideal. Let us test if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is principal. If $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), then the norm of the ideal would be equal to the norm of the element:\n$$N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = N(\\alpha) = N(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$$\nWe know $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 2$, so we need to solve the Diophantine equation:\n$$a^2 + 5b^2 = 2$$\nfor integers $a$ and $b$.\nIf $b \\ne 0$, then $b^2 \\ge 1$, which implies $5b^2 \\ge 5$. In this case, $a^2 + 5b^2 \\ge 5 > 2$.\nIf $b=0$, the equation becomes $a^2 = 2$. There is no integer $a$ that satisfies this equation.\nThus, there are no integer solutions $(a,b)$ to the equation $a^2 + 5b^2 = 2$. This proves that there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with norm $2$. Consequently, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not a principal ideal.\n\nSo, the class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is not the identity element in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$. Since $[\\mathfrak{p}_2] \\ne [1]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [1]$, the order of the element $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is exactly $2$.\nThe ideal class group is generated by a single element of order $2$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ is a cyclic group of order $2$, i.e., $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe order of the ideal class group is the number of elements in the group, which is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$"}, {"introduction": "While the previous methods work well for simple cases, a more systematic and powerful approach is needed for complex fields.

Its norm is:\n$$N(\\alpha) = N\\left(a + b\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-15}}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\left(a+\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)^2 = a^2 + ab + \\frac{b^2}{4} + \\frac{15b^2}{4} = a^2 + ab + 4b^2$$\nWe seek integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the equation $a^2 + ab + 4b^2 = 2^k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\nLet's test small integer values for $a$ and $b$. If $b=1$ and $a=0$, we find $\\alpha=\\omega$.\n$$N(\\omega) = 0^2 + (0)(1) + 4(1^2) = 4 = 2^2$$\nWe have found an element $\\omega$ whose norm is $4$. This gives a principal ideal $(\\omega)$ with norm $N((\\omega))=4$. We now find the prime factorization of $(\\omega)$. Since $N((\\omega)) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)^2$, we expect $(\\omega)$ to be the product of two prime ideals of norm $2$.\nBy definition, $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, \\omega)$, so $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2$. This implies that $(\\omega)$ is divisible by $\\mathfrak{p}_2$.\nTo check divisibility by $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$, we check if $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2' = (2, \\omega-1)$. If $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2'$, then $\\omega = 2x + (\\omega-1)y$ for some $x,y \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. This would imply $1 = (\\omega-1)y - (\\omega-2x) \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2'$, which would mean $\\mathfrak{p}_2'=\\mathcal{O}_K$, a contradiction. Alternatively, using congruences, modulo $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$, we have $\\omega \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}_2'}$. Since $1 \\not\\equiv 0$, $\\omega$ is not in $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$, so $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$ does not divide $(\\omega)$.\nThe only possible prime factorization of $(\\omega)$ is therefore $(\\omega) = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2$.\nThis factorization implies a relation in the class group: $[(\\omega)] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [1]$.\nIn terms of our generator $g=[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$, this relation is $g^2 = 1$.\nThis shows the order of $g$ is either $1$ or $2$. If the order is $1$, then $g=[1]$, which means $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a principal ideal. If $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, then $|N(\\alpha)| = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)=2$. We must check if the equation $a^2+ab+4b^2=2$ has integer solutions for $a,b$.\nLet's analyze the quadratic form $Q(a,b) = a^2+ab+4b^2$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=2$, no integer solution for $a$.\nIf $|b| \\ge 1$, we can complete the square: $Q(a,b) = (a+\\frac{b}{2})^2 + \\frac{15}{4}b^2$. For $|b| \\ge 1$, $\\frac{15}{4}b^2 \\ge \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75 > 2$. Since $(a+\\frac{b}{2})^2 \\ge 0$, we have $a^2+ab+4b^2 > 2$ for any integer $a$ when $|b| \\ge 1$.\nThus, the equation $a^2+ab+4b^2=2$ has no integer solutions. This proves that there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$, so the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not principal.\nTherefore, its class $g=[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is not the identity in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. Since $g^2=[1]$ and $g \\ne [1]$, the order of $g$ is exactly $2$.\n\nTo formalize this using the matrix method as requested:\nThe group of generators is generated by $g=[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. We can model this with the free abelian group on one generator, $\\mathbb{Z}$, via the surjective map $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ with $1 \\mapsto g$.\nThe relations correspond to the kernel of $\\phi$. The relation $g^2=1$ corresponds to the element $2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe relation matrix $R$ is formed by the vectors representing the relations. In this case, we have one generator and one relation, $2g=0$ (in additive notation). The relation vector is $(2)$, so the relation matrix is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix:\n$$R = (2)$$\nThe Smith Normal Form (SNF) of this matrix is simply $(2)$.\nThe structure of the class group is the cokernel of the map represented by $R$:\n$$\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} / \\operatorname{im}(R) = \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z}$$\nThe ideal class group is a cyclic group of order $2$.\n\nThe class number $h_K$ is the order of the class group.\n$$h_K = |\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)| = |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 2$$\nThus, the class number of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-15})$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$"}]}
