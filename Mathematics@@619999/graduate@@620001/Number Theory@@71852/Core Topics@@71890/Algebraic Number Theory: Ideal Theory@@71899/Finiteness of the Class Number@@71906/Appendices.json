We are asked to compute the discriminant $D_K$, the Minkowski bound constant $C_K$, and the class number $h_K$ for the quadratic number field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe first step is to determine the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of $K$. For a number field of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. In our case, $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so we have $d=2$. Since $2$ is square-free and $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}] = \\{a+b\\sqrt{2} \\mid a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. An integral basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$.\n\nNext, we compute the field discriminant $D_K$. The degree of the extension is $n=[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$. Since $d=2 > 0$, $K$ is a real quadratic field, which has $r_1=2$ real embeddings and $r_2=0$ pairs of complex conjugate embeddings. The two embeddings of $K$ into $\\mathbb{C}$ (which map into $\\mathbb{R}$) are the identity map $\\sigma_1$ and the conjugation map $\\sigma_2$:\n$$ \\sigma_1(a+b\\sqrt{2}) = a+b\\sqrt{2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_2(a+b\\sqrt{2}) = a-b\\sqrt{2} $$\nThe discriminant $D_K$ is defined as the square of the determinant of the matrix formed by applying these embeddings to the basis elements:\n$$ D_K = \\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1(1) & \\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ \\sigma_2(1) & \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}) \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 & -\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 $$\nThe determinant is $(1)(-\\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{2})(1) = -2\\sqrt{2}$. Squaring this value gives the discriminant:\n$$ D_K = (-2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 $$\nAlternatively, for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod{4}$, the discriminant is $4d$. For $d=2$, this gives $D_K = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nNow, we compute the Minkowski bound constant $C_K$. The problem specifies that we should specialize the general Minkowski bound for this purpose. The formula for the Minkowski bound is:\n$$ C_K = \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\sqrt{|D_K|} $$\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we have $n=2$, $r_1=2$, $r_2=0$, and $|D_K|=8$.

By a fundamental theorem of Minkowski, every ideal class in the ideal class group $\\text{Cl}(K)$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that its absolute norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a})$ satisfies $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le C_K$.\nIn our case, this means every ideal class contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le \\sqrt{2}$. Since the norm of a non-zero integral ideal must be an integer greater than or equal to $1$, the only possible integer value for the norm is $1$.\n$$ N(\\mathfrak{a}) = 1 $$\nThe only integral ideal with norm $1$ is the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ itself, which is the principal ideal $(1)$.\nThis implies that every ideal class in $\\text{Cl}(K)$ contains the ideal $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The class of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the principal ideal class, which is the identity element of the group $\\text{Cl}(K)$. Therefore, every ideal class is the principal ideal class. This means the class group is trivial, containing only one element.\nThe class number $h_K$ is the order of the class group, so we conclude:\n$$ h_K = |\\text{Cl}(K)| = 1 $$\nThis means that $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$ is a principal ideal domain.\n\nSummarizing the results, we have $D_K = 8$, $C_K = \\sqrt{2}$, and $h_K = 1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & \\sqrt{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "3014349"}, {"introduction": "Having seen a case where the class number is one, we now turn to the classic example of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, a field with a non-trivial class group.

For a quadratic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d\\equiv 2$ or $3\\pmod{4}$, and $\\mathcal{O}_{K}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, we have $d=-5$, and since $-5\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.\n\nNext, we compute the norm of the ideal $I = (2,\\,1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The norm of an ideal $I$ is defined as the cardinality of the quotient ring, $N(I)=|\\mathcal{O}_{K}/I|$.\nWe have $\\mathcal{O}_{K}/I = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] / (2,\\,1+\\sqrt{-5})$.\nIn the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_{K}/I$, the generators of $I$ are equivalent to $0$. Thus, $2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$ and $1+\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$, which implies $\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{I}$.\nAny element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) has a residue class modulo $I$ given by:\n$a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\equiv a+b(-1) = a-b \\pmod{I}$.\nSince $2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$, the value of $a-b$ is considered modulo $2$.\nThis suggests an isomorphism $\\mathcal{O}_{K}/I \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Let us prove this by defining a ring homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathcal{O}_{K} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ by $\\phi(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = (a-b) \\pmod{2}$.\nThis map is surjective, since for example $\\phi(1) = 1 \\pmod{2}$ and $\\phi(2) = 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe kernel of $\\phi$ consists of all elements $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ such that $a-b$ is even, i.e., $a \\equiv b \\pmod{2}$.\nWe must show that $\\ker(\\phi)=I$.\nIf $\\alpha \\in I$, then $\\alpha = 2(c+d\\sqrt{-5}) + (1+\\sqrt{-5})(e+f\\sqrt{-5})$ for some $c,d,e,f \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nExpanding this, $\\alpha = (2c+e-5f) + (2d+e+f)\\sqrt{-5}$. Let $\\alpha = x+y\\sqrt{-5}$.\nThen $x=2c+e-5f$ and $y=2d+e+f$.\n$x-y = (2c+e-5f) - (2d+e+f) = 2c-2d-6f = 2(c-d-3f)$, which is an even integer.\nThus, $\\alpha \\in \\ker(\\phi)$, so $I \\subseteq \\ker(\\phi)$.\nConversely, let $\\alpha=a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\ker(\\phi)$, so $a \\equiv b \\pmod{2}$.\nCase 1: $a$ and $b$ are both even. Then $a=2k$, $b=2l$ for some $k,l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. So $\\alpha=2k+2l\\sqrt{-5}=2(k+l\\sqrt{-5}) \\in (2) \\subset I$.\nCase 2: $a$ and $b$ are both odd. Then $a=2k+1$, $b=2l+1$.\n$\\alpha = (2k+1) + (2l+1)\\sqrt{-5} = 2k + 1 + 2l\\sqrt{-5} + \\sqrt{-5} = 2k + (2l)\\sqrt{-5} + (1+\\sqrt{-5})$.\nWe can write this as $\\alpha = 2(k-l) + (2l+1)(1+\\sqrt{-5})$, which is an element of $I=(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$.\nThus $\\ker(\\phi) \\subseteq I$. Combining both inclusions, we have $\\ker(\\phi) = I$.\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings, $\\mathcal{O}_{K}/I \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, $N(I) = |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 2$.\n\nTo prove that $I$ is not a principal ideal, we assume for contradiction that $I=(\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The norm of a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$ is given by the absolute value of the field norm of its generator, $N((\\alpha)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$.\nFor $\\alpha=a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$, the field norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = a^2+5b^2$.\nOur assumption implies we must have $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|=N(I)$, which is $a^2+5b^2=2$ for some integers $a, b$.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $b^2 \\ge 1$, which implies $5b^2 \\ge 5$. Then $a^2+5b^2 \\ge 5$, so no solution is possible.\nIf $b=0$, the equation becomes $a^2=2$. There is no integer $a$ that satisfies this equation.\nTherefore, there is no element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with norm $2$. This is a contradiction, so the ideal $I$ cannot be principal.\n\n2) To factor the ideal $(2)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, we consider the minimal polynomial $f(x)=x^2+5$ of $\\sqrt{-5}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We check its factorization modulo $2$.\n$x^2+5 \\equiv x^2+1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod{2}$.\nSince the polynomial has a repeated linear factor modulo $2$, the rational prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The corresponding prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $P=(2, \\sqrt{-5}+1)$. This is exactly the ideal $I$. The theory of factorization in quadratic fields states that $(2)=P^2=I^2$.\nTo verify this, we note that $I^2 = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5}) = (4, 2(1+\\sqrt{-5}), (1+\\sqrt{-5})^2)$. Since $(1+\\sqrt{-5})^2 = -4+2\\sqrt{-5}$, all generators of $I^2$ are multiples of $2$, so $I^2 \\subseteq (2)$. We can prove equality by comparing norms. The norm of $I^2$ is $N(I^2) = N(I)^2 = 2^2 = 4$. The norm of the principal ideal $(2)$ is $N((2)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)| = 2^2=4$. Since $I^2 \\subseteq (2)$ and both ideals have the same finite norm, they must be equal: $I^2=(2)$.\n\nThe order of an ideal class $[I]$ in the ideal class group $\\mathrm{Cl}_{K}$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $I^n$ is a principal ideal.\nWe have shown that $I^2=(2)$, which is a principal ideal generated by the element $2 \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$.\nTherefore, in the class group, $[I]^2 = [I^2] = [(2)]$, and $[(2)]$ is the identity element.\nThis implies that the order of $[I]$ divides $2$.\nIn part 1, we proved that $I$ is not principal, so its class $[I]$ is not the identity element in $\\mathrm{Cl}_{K}$.\nHence, the order of $[I]$ is not $1$. The only other positive divisor of $2$ is $2$.\nThus, the order of the ideal class $[I]$ is exactly $2$.\n\n3) The class number $h_{K}$ is the order of the ideal class group, $h_{K}=|\\mathrm{Cl}_{K}|$. The class number is $1$ if and only if $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a principal ideal domain (PID), which is equivalent to every ideal being principal.\nSince we have found an ideal $I=(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$ which is not principal, $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is not a PID, and therefore the class number $h_{K}$ must be strictly greater than $1$.\n\nTo determine the exact value of $h_{K}$, we use the Minkowski bound. For an imaginary quadratic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d<0$, every ideal class contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with norm $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le M_K = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of $K$.\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, $d=-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, so the discriminant is $\\Delta_K = 4d = -20$.\nThe Minkowski bound is $M_K = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{20} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{\\pi}$.\nUsing the approximations $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$ and $\\pi \\approx 3.1416$, we get $M_K \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 2.236}{3.1416} \\approx \\frac{8.944}{3.1416} \\approx 2.847$.\nThus, the ideal class group $\\mathrm{Cl}_{K}$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals $P$ with norm $N(P) \\le M_K$. The norm of a prime ideal is a power of a rational prime, $N(P)=p^f$.\nThe only rational prime $p$ such that $p \\le 2.847$ is $p=2$.\nSo we only need to consider the prime ideals lying over $2$.\nAs established in part 2, the prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, with $(2)=I^2$ where $I=(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$ is a prime ideal of norm $N(I)=2$.\nTherefore, the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}_{K}$ is generated by the ideal class $[I]$.\nThe elements of the group are powers of the generator $[I]$: $[\\mathcal{O}_K]=[(1)]$, $[I]$, $[I]^2$, ... .\nWe know that $[I]^2$ is the identity class. So the group elements are just $\\{[(1)], [I]\\}$.\nSince $[I]$ is not the identity class, these two classes are distinct.\nThus, the class group is $\\mathrm{Cl}_{K} = \\{[(1)], [I]\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe order of the class group, the class number, is $h_{K}=2$.\nThe ideal class $[I]$ is the unique non-trivial ideal class in $\\mathrm{Cl}_{K}$.\nThe order of this ideal class $[I]$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3014442"}, {"introduction": "To conclude our practice, we extend the method to a field of higher degree: a totally real cubic field $K$.

We are to follow a sequence of prescribed steps using fundamental principles of algebraic number theory.\n\n**1. Ring of Integers and Field Discriminant**\n\nFirst, we establish that $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer. By definition, an algebraic integer is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. The given polynomial $f(x) = x^{3} + x^{2} - 2x - 1$ is monic and its coefficients are in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $f(\\alpha) = 0$, $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer. This implies that the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is a subring of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of the field $K$.\n\nNext, we compute the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$. For a cubic polynomial of the form $x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx + c$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = a^{2}b^{2} - 4b^{3} - 4a^{3}c - 27c^{2} + 18abc$. For $f(x)$, we have $a=1$, $b=-2$, and $c=-1$. Substituting these values, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta(f) = (1)^{2}(-2)^{2} - 4(-2)^{3} - 4(1)^{3}(-1) - 27(-1)^{2} + 18(1)(-2)(-1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(f) = 4 - 4(-8) - 4(-1) - 27(1) + 36 = 4 + 32 + 4 - 27 + 36 = 76 - 27 = 49\n$$\nThe discriminant of the polynomial is $\\Delta(f) = 49 = 7^{2}$. The discriminant of the basis $\\{1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2}\\}$ for the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is equal to the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$. This is related to the field discriminant $D_{K}$ by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{disc}(\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]) = [\\mathcal{O}_{K} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]^{2} D_{K}\n$$\nSubstituting the value we found:\n$$\n49 = [\\mathcal{O}_{K} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]^{2} D_{K}\n$$\nThe index $[\\mathcal{O}_{K} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ must be an integer. From the equation, it must be a divisor of $\\sqrt{49}=7$. Thus, the index can be $1$ or $7$.\nIf the index were $7$, the equation would become $49 = 7^{2} D_{K}$, which implies $D_{K}=1$. The only number field with discriminant $1$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$. However, $K$ is a cubic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=3 \\neq 1$. Therefore, a discriminant of $1$ is impossible.\nThe only remaining possibility is that the index $[\\mathcal{O}_{K} : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ is $1$. This implies that $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$.\nWith the index being $1$, the field discriminant is $D_{K} = \\text{disc}(\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]) = \\Delta(f) = 49$.\n\n**2. Signature of the Field**\n\nThe signature $(r_{1}, r_{2})$ of a number field $K$ of degree $n$ is determined by the number of real embeddings ($r_{1}$) and pairs of complex conjugate embeddings ($r_{2}$), satisfying $n = r_{1} + 2r_{2}$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, the degree is $n=3$, so we must have $3 = r_{1} + 2r_{2}$. The possible signatures are $(3, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$. The number of real embeddings corresponds to the number of real roots of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$. We analyze $f(x)$ to find its real roots:\n- $f(-2) = (-2)^{3} + (-2)^{2} - 2(-2) - 1 = -8 + 4 + 4 - 1 = -1 < 0$\n- $f(-1) = (-1)^{3} + (-1)^{2} - 2(-1) - 1 = -1 + 1 + 2 - 1 = 1 > 0$\n- $f(0) = -1 < 0$\n- $f(1) = 1^{3} + 1^{2} - 2(1) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 2 - 1 = -1 < 0$\n- $f(2) = 2^{3} + 2^{2} - 2(2) - 1 = 8 + 4 - 4 - 1 = 7 > 0$\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root in $(-2, -1)$, a root in $(-1, 0)$, and a root in $(1, 2)$. Since $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, it can have at most $3$ roots. We have found $3$ distinct real roots.\nTherefore, there are $r_{1}=3$ real embeddings and $r_{2}=0$ pairs of complex embeddings. The signature of $K$ is $(3, 0)$. This means $K$ is a totally real cubic field.\n\n**3. Minkowski Bound**\n\nThe Minkowski bound, $M_{K}$, provides an upper bound on the norm of an ideal that must exist in every ideal class. The formula is:\n$$\nM_{K} = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_{2}} \\frac{n!}{n^{n}} \\sqrt{|D_{K}|}\n$$\nUsing the values we determined: $n=3$, $r_{2}=0$, and $D_{K}=49$.\n$$\nM_{K} = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{0} \\frac{3!}{3^{3}} \\sqrt{|49|} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{6}{27} \\cdot 7 = \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot 7 = \\frac{14}{9}\n$$\nSo, the Minkowski bound for $K$ is $M_{K} = \\frac{14}{9}$. The theorem of Minkowski asserts that every ideal class in the class group of $K$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\leq M_{K}$.\n\n**4. Ideals with Norm below the Minkowski Bound**\n\nWe need to list all nonzero integral ideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ such that $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\leq M_{K} = \\frac{14}{9}$. The norm of a nonzero integral ideal is always a positive integer. Since $\\frac{14}{9} \\approx 1.55...$, the only positive integer satisfying this condition is $1$.\nSo, we are looking for all integral ideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ with $N(\\mathfrak{a}) = 1$. The norm of an ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is the size of the quotient ring $|\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{a}|$. If $|\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{a}| = 1$, then the quotient ring is trivial, which means $\\mathfrak{a}$ must be the entire ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$.\nThe only ideal satisfying the condition is $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ itself. This ideal is principal, as it can be generated by $1$, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = (1)$.\n\n**5. Conclusion on the Class Number**\n\nThe class group $\\text{Cl}(K)$ is the group of ideal classes of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The class number $h_{K}$ is the order of this group. The result from the Minkowski bound implies that every ideal class in $\\text{Cl}(K)$ must contain a representative from the list of ideals found in the previous step.\nOur list contains only one ideal: $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The ideal $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is the identity element of the class group, representing the class of principal ideals.\nSince every ideal class has $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ as a representative, every ideal class must be the principal ideal class. This means that the class group is trivial; it consists of only one element.\nTherefore, the class number of $K$, which is the size of the class group, is $1$.\n$$\nh_{K} = 1\n$$\nThis concludes the argument that the class number of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3014384"}]}
