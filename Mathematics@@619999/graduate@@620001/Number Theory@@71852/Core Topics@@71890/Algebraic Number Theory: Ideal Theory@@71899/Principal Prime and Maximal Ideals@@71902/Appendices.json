No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for three main derivations concerning ideal class groups and then a final numerical computation. We will address each part in sequence.\n\nFirst, we address the criterion for the triviality of the ideal class group. Let $K$ be a number field and $\\mathcal{O}_K$ be its ring of integers. The group of nonzero fractional ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is denoted by $J(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. The subgroup of principal fractional ideals is denoted by $P(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. By definition, the ideal class group is the quotient group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K) = J(\\mathcal{O}_K) / P(\\mathcal{O}_K)$.\n\nThe class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ is trivial if and only if it consists of a single element, which must be the identity element of the group. In a quotient group, the identity element is the subgroup by which the quotient is taken. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ is trivial if and only if $J(\\mathcal{O}_K) = P(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. This statement means that every nonzero fractional ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a principal fractional ideal.\n\nWe now show that this condition is equivalent to the condition that every nonzero integral ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is principal.\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume every nonzero fractional ideal is principal. An integral ideal is a specific type of fractional ideal (one that is contained in $\\mathcal{O}_K$). Thus, if every nonzero fractional ideal is principal, it follows directly that every nonzero integral ideal is principal.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume every nonzero integral ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is principal. Let $\\mathfrak{a}$ be an arbitrary nonzero fractional ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. By the definition of a fractional ideal, there exists a nonzero element $d \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that the set $I = d\\mathfrak{a} = \\{ da \\mid a \\in \\mathfrak{a} \\}$ is an (integral) ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\\mathfrak{a}$ is nonzero, $I$ is a nonzero ideal. By our assumption, $I$ must be a principal ideal. Therefore, there exists some nonzero element $x \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $I = (x)$, where $(x) = x\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nSo, we have the equality of sets $d\\mathfrak{a} = (x)$. Since $d$ is a nonzero element of the field $K$, its inverse $d^{-1}$ exists in $K$. We can write $\\mathfrak{a} = d^{-1}(x) = \\{ d^{-1}y \\mid y \\in (x) \\} = \\{ d^{-1}(xz) \\mid z \\in \\mathcal{O}_K \\} = (d^{-1}x)\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nLet $\\alpha = d^{-1}x$. Then $\\alpha$ is a nonzero element of the number field $K$. The ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is generated by this single element $\\alpha$, which means $\\mathfrak{a} = (\\alpha)$. By definition, an ideal of the form $(\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha \\in K^{\\times}$ is a principal fractional ideal. Since $\\mathfrak{a}$ was an arbitrary nonzero fractional ideal, we have shown that every nonzero fractional ideal is principal. This means $J(\\mathcal{O}_K) = P(\\mathcal{O}_K)$, and consequently, the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ is trivial. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nSecond, we compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathbb{Z}[i])$. The ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, is the ring of integers of the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. We will show that $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a principal ideal domain (PID). To do this, we demonstrate that it is a Euclidean domain with respect to the norm $N(a+bi) = a^2+b^2$.\nAn integral domain $R$ is a Euclidean domain if there is a function $N: R \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ such that for any $\\alpha, \\beta \\in R$ with $\\beta \\neq 0$, there exist $q, r \\in R$ such that $\\alpha = q\\beta + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $N(r) < N(\\beta)$.\n\nLet $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $\\beta \\neq 0$. Consider the element $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ in the field of fractions $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. We can write $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} = x+iy$ for some rational numbers $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We seek a Gaussian integer $q = m+ni$ (where $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) that is \"closest\" to $x+iy$. We can always find integers $m$ and $n$ such that $|x-m| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ and $|y-n| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. Let $q = m+ni$. Then $q \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nWe can write $\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\\beta = (q + (x-m)+i(y-n))\\beta = q\\beta + ((x-m)+i(y-n))\\beta$.\nLet $r = \\alpha - q\\beta$. By construction, $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ since $\\alpha, q, \\beta$ are all in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Also, $r = ((x-m)+i(y-n))\\beta$.\nWe must check the norm condition on $r$. If $r=0$, the division is exact. If $r \\neq 0$, we have:\n$N(r) = N(((x-m)+i(y-n))\\beta) = N((x-m)+i(y-n)) N(\\beta)$.\nThe norm of the term $\\delta = (x-m)+i(y-n)$ is $N(\\delta) = (x-m)^2 + (y-n)^2$.\nDue to our choice of $m$ and $n$, we have $(x-m)^2 \\le \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $(y-n)^2 \\le \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThus, $N(\\delta) \\le \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo, $N(r) = N(\\delta)N(\\beta) \\le \\frac{1}{2}N(\\beta)$. Since $\\beta \\neq 0$, $N(\\beta)$ is a positive integer, so $N(r) < N(\\beta)$.\nThis proves that $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean domain.\n\nNow we justify why a Euclidean domain is a PID. Let $I$ be any nonzero ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The set $\\{N(x) \\mid x \\in I, x \\neq 0\\}$ is a non-empty set of positive integers. By the well-ordering principle, this set has a minimum element. Let $d \\in I$ be an element such that $N(d)$ is this minimum value. We claim $I = (d)$.\nThe inclusion $(d) \\subseteq I$ is clear since $d \\in I$ and $I$ is an ideal. For the reverse inclusion, let $a \\in I$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean domain, we can write $a = qd+r$ for some $q, r \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ where either $r=0$ or $N(r) < N(d)$. The remainder is $r=a-qd$. Since $a \\in I$ and $d \\in I$, $qd \\in I$, so $r \\in I$. If $r \\neq 0$, then $r$ is a nonzero element of $I$ with $N(r) < N(d)$, which contradicts the choice of $d$ as having the minimum nonzero norm in $I$. Thus, it must be that $r=0$. This implies $a=qd$, so $a \\in (d)$. Since $a$ was arbitrary, $I \\subseteq (d)$. Therefore, $I=(d)$, so every ideal is principal.\nSince $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a PID, every nonzero integral ideal is principal. From our first derivation, this implies that the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathbb{Z}[i])$ is trivial. The order of the trivial group is $1$. The class number is defined as $h_K=|\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)|$. Thus, $h_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)} = 1$.\n\nThird, we compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega])$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity satisfying $\\omega^2+\\omega+1=0$. The ring of Eisenstein integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$, is the ring of integers of the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$. We show that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ is a PID by proving it is a Euclidean domain with the norm $N(a+b\\omega) = a^2-ab+b^2$.\nLet $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ with $\\beta \\neq 0$. The element $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$. We can write $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} = x+y\\omega$ for unique $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We choose an Eisenstein integer $q = m+n\\omega$ (with $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) that approximates $x+y\\omega$. Let $m, n$ be integers such that $|x-m| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ and $|y-n| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\nLet $q = m+n\\omega$. We define the remainder $r = \\alpha - q\\beta$. Then $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$.\n$r = (\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} - q)\\beta = ((x-m) + (y-n)\\omega)\\beta$.\nIf $r=0$, we are done. If $r \\neq 0$, we have $N(r) = N((x-m) + (y-n)\\omega) N(\\beta)$.\nLet $\\delta_x = x-m$ and $\\delta_y = y-n$. We have $|\\delta_x| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ and $|\\delta_y| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe norm of the error term is $N(\\delta_x + \\delta_y\\omega) = \\delta_x^2 - \\delta_x\\delta_y + \\delta_y^2$.\nThis quadratic form can be written as $(\\delta_x - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_y)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}\\delta_y^2$.\nGiven the constraints on $\\delta_x, \\delta_y$, the maximum value is attained at the corners of the square $[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}] \\times [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, specifically when $\\delta_x$ and $\\delta_y$ have opposite signs. For instance, if $\\delta_x = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\delta_y = -\\frac{1}{2}$, the value is $(\\frac{1}{2})^2 - (\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) + (-\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nSo, $N(\\delta_x + \\delta_y\\omega) \\le \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThus, $N(r) \\le \\frac{3}{4}N(\\beta)$. Since $\\beta \\neq 0$, $N(\\beta)>0$, implying $N(r) < N(\\beta)$.\nThis proves that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ is a Euclidean domain.\nThe argument that a Euclidean domain is a PID is identical to the one given for $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Every nonzero ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ is generated by an element of minimal norm.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ is a PID. Using the result from the first part, since every nonzero integral ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ is principal, its class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega])$ is trivial. Thus, the class number is $h_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute $h_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)} + h_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)}$.\nFrom our derivations, we found $h_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)} = 1$ and $h_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)} = 1$.\nThe final sum is $1+1=2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3021494"}, {"introduction": "When the global ideal structure of a ring is complex, a powerful technique is to \"localize\" by focusing on the behavior at a single prime ideal.

By the definition of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ as the inverse limit $\\varprojlim_{n \\geq 1} \\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$, an element $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a sequence $(x_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ where $x_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$ and $x_{m} \\equiv x_n \\pmod{p^n}$ for $m > n$.

The set of all elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ divisible by $p$ forms the principal ideal generated by $p$, denoted $(p)$. Thus, $\\ker(\\phi) = (p)$.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings, the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_p/\\ker(\\phi)$ is isomorphic to the image of the map, $\\operatorname{Im}(\\phi)$. The map $\\phi$ is surjective because for any element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, we can lift it to an integer $\\tilde{a} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and the constant sequence $(\\tilde{a} \\pmod{p^n})_{n \\geq 1}$ defines an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ that maps to $a$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Im}(\\phi) = \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThis gives the isomorphism $\\mathbb{Z}_p/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $p$ is a prime number, the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is a field. A fundamental result in ring theory states that an ideal $I$ in a commutative ring $R$ is maximal if and only if the quotient ring $R/I$ is a field. Therefore, the ideal $(p)$ is a maximal ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Furthermore, every maximal ideal in a commutative ring with unity is also a prime ideal. Thus, $(p)$ is a prime ideal.\n\n2. Let $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ be a nonzero element. The $p$-adic valuation $v_p(x)$ is a non-negative integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$. By definition of the valuation on the field of $p$-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ (which contains $\\mathbb{Z}_p$), we can write $x = p^n u$ where $u \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$ has valuation $v_p(u) = 0$. Since $v_p(x) \\geq 0$, $x$ is an integer, and $v_p(p^n) = n \\geq 0$, it follows that $u = x/p^n$ must also have non-negative valuation. As $v_p(u)=0$, $u$ is a $p$-adic integer. An element $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a unit (i.e., invertible in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$) if and only if $v_p(u) = 0$. This is because if $v_p(u) = 0$, then $u \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, so its image in the field $\\mathbb{Z}_p/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is nonzero and hence invertible. This invertibility can be lifted to $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Conversely, if $u$ is a unit with inverse $u^{-1}$, then $v_p(u) + v_p(u^{-1}) = v_p(1) = 0$. As valuations on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ are non-negative, this implies $v_p(u) = 0$. Thus, any nonzero $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ can be uniquely written as $x=p^n u$ where $n=v_p(x) \\geq 0$ and $u$ is a unit.\n\nNow, let $I$ be a nonzero proper ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Consider the set of valuations of its nonzero elements, $S = \\{v_p(x) \\mid x \\in I, x \\neq 0\\}$. Since $I$ is a nonzero ideal, $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$. Let $n = \\min S$. Because $I$ is a proper ideal, it does not contain any units, so $n \\geq 1$. Let $a \\in I$ be an element with $v_p(a) = n$. We can write $a = p^n u$ for some unit $u$. Since $a \\in I$, the principal ideal $(a)$ is contained in $I$. As $u$ is a unit, $(a) = (p^n u) = (p^n)$, so $(p^n) \\subseteq I$.\n\nFor any other element $b \\in I$, let $v_p(b) = m$. By the definition of $n$, $m \\geq n$. We can write $b=p^m v$ for some unit $v$. Then $b = p^n (p^{m-n}v)$. Since $m \\geq n$, the factor $p^{m-n}v$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. This shows that $b$ is a multiple of $p^n$, so $b \\in (p^n)$. Since this holds for all $b \\in I$, we have $I \\subseteq (p^n)$.\n\nCombining both inclusions, we conclude that $I = (p^n)$ for some integer $n \\geq 1$. This integer $n$ is unique, as $(p^n)=(p^m)$ implies $n=m$. Thus, every nonzero proper ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is of the form $(p^n)$ for a unique integer $n \\geq 1$. These ideals are all principal.\n\nThe identification of $(p^n)$ with the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p : v_p(x) \\geq n\\}$ for $n \\geq 0$ is direct. If $x \\in (p^n)$, then $x=p^n y$ for some $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, so $v_p(x) = n + v_p(y) \\geq n$. Conversely, if $v_p(x) = k \\geq n$, then $x=p^k u = p^n(p^{k-n}u)$, where $u$ is a unit. Since $k-n \\geq 0$, $p^{k-n}u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, which means $x \\in (p^n)$.\n\n3. We want to compute the index $[\\mathbb{Z}_p : (p^n)]$. This is the size of the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_p / (p^n)$. Consider the ring homomorphism $\\psi: \\mathbb{Z}_p \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$ defined by $\\psi(x) = x \\pmod{p^n}$. The kernel of this map is the set of $p$-adic integers $x$ such that $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^n}$. This condition is equivalent to $v_p(x) \\geq n$. From part 2, this set is precisely the ideal $(p^n)$. So, $\\ker(\\psi) = (p^n)$.\n\nThe map $\\psi$ is surjective. For any congruence class $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$, we can choose an integer representative $\\tilde{a} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, $\\tilde{a}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, and $\\psi(\\tilde{a}) = \\tilde{a} \\pmod{p^n} = a$.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\\mathbb{Z}_p / (p^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$. The order of the finite ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$ is $p^n$. Therefore, the index is $[\\mathbb{Z}_p : (p^n)] = |\\mathbb{Z}_p / (p^n)| = p^n$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Dirichlet series $S(s) = \\sum_{I \\neq \\{0\\}} [\\mathbb{Z}_p : I]^{-s}$. The nonzero ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ are the principal ideals $(p^n)$ for all integers $n \\geq 0$. This includes the ideal $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ itself, which corresponds to $n=0$. For each such ideal $I_n = (p^n)$, the index is $[\\mathbb{Z}_p : I_n] = p^n$.\n\nThe sum becomes:\n$$\nS(s) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} [\\mathbb{Z}_p : (p^n)]^{-s} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (p^n)^{-s} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p^{-ns}\n$$\nThis is a geometric series with first term $1$ and common ratio $r = p^{-s}$. The series converges if $|r| < 1$. The magnitude of the ratio is $|p^{-s}| = |p^{-\\Re(s)}| = p^{-\\Re(s)}$. The condition for convergence is $p^{-\\Re(s)} < 1$, which is equivalent to $\\Re(s) > 0$. The problem specifies that $\\Re(s) > 1$, so the series converges absolutely.\n\nThe sum of a convergent geometric series is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{1-r}$.

Since they are distinct maximal ideals, we have\n$$\n\\mathfrak{p} + \\mathfrak{q} \\;=\\; R,\n$$\nwhich means $\\mathfrak{p}$ and $\\mathfrak{q}$ are comaximal. Because powers of distinct prime ideals remain contained in the corresponding prime ideals, it follows that for $i \\neq j$,\n$$\n\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}} + \\mathfrak{p}_{j}^{e_{j}} \\;=\\; R,\n$$\nso the family $\\{\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}\\}_{i=1}^{r}$ is pairwise comaximal.\n\nWe now invoke the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). For rings and ideals, the Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if $I_{1},\\dots,I_{r} \\subset R$ are pairwise comaximal ideals, then the canonical ring homomorphism\n$$\n\\phi \\colon R \\longrightarrow \\prod_{i=1}^{r} R/I_{i}, \\quad \\phi(x) \\;=\\; \\big(x \\bmod I_{1}, \\dots, x \\bmod I_{r}\\big),\n$$\nhas kernel equal to the intersection $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{r} I_{i}$, and is surjective. When the $I_{i}$ are pairwise comaximal, the intersection equals the product, so we have $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{r} I_{i} = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} I_{i}$. Therefore, by the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings,\n$$\nR \\big/ \\prod_{i=1}^{r} I_{i} \\;\\cong\\; \\prod_{i=1}^{r} R/I_{i}.\n$$\nApplying this to $I_{i} = \\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$, we obtain the explicit isomorphism\n$$\nR \\big/ \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}} \\;\\cong\\; \\prod_{i=1}^{r} R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}.\n$$\nConcretely, one can construct orthogonal idempotents in $R/I$ as follows. Fix $i$. Since $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}} + \\prod_{j \\neq i} \\mathfrak{p}_{j}^{e_{j}} = R$, there exist $a_{i} \\in \\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ and $b_{i} \\in \\prod_{j \\neq i} \\mathfrak{p}_{j}^{e_{j}}$ such that $a_{i} + b_{i} = 1$. In $R/I$ the class $[b_{i}]$ satisfies $[b_{i}] \\equiv 1 \\bmod \\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ and $[b_{i}] \\equiv 0 \\bmod \\mathfrak{p}_{j}^{e_{j}}$ for $j \\neq i$, and the collection $\\{[b_{i}]\\}_{i=1}^{r}$ consists of orthogonal idempotents summing to $1$. These provide the explicit splitting of $R/I$ into the product $\\prod_{i=1}^{r} R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$.\n\nNext, we argue that each $R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ is a local ring. Since $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ is a maximal ideal of $R$, the quotient $R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ is a field, and the only maximal ideal of $R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ is $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$. Indeed, the Jacobson radical of $R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ is the unique maximal ideal induced by $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}$, because any unit modulo $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ lifts to a unit modulo $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ by standard arguments on localizing at $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}$. Thus $R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ is a finite local ring with maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_{i}/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the cardinality $|R/I|$. In the ring of integers $R$ of a number field, the ideal norm $N(\\mathfrak{a})$ of a nonzero ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is defined by $N(\\mathfrak{a}) := |R/\\mathfrak{a}|$, and satisfies multiplicativity: $N(\\mathfrak{a}\\mathfrak{b}) = N(\\mathfrak{a}) N(\\mathfrak{b})$. In particular, for a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ and a positive integer $e$, we have\n$$\nN\\!\\big(\\mathfrak{p}^{e}\\big) \\;=\\; \\big(N(\\mathfrak{p})\\big)^{e}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n|R/I| \\;=\\; N(I) \\;=\\; N\\!\\Big(\\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}\\Big) \\;=\\; \\prod_{i=1}^{r} N\\!\\big(\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}\\big) \\;=\\; \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\big(N(\\mathfrak{p}_{i})\\big)^{e_{i}}.\n$$\nSince $R/I \\cong \\prod_{i=1}^{r} R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$ by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the cardinality of $R/I$ also equals the product of the cardinalities of the factors $R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}$, which is consistent with the multiplicativity of the norm:\n$$\n\\big|R/\\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{e_{i}}\\big| \\;=\\; \\big(N(\\mathfrak{p}_{i})\\big)^{e_{i}}.\n$$\nThus the requested closed-form expression for $|R/I|$ in terms of the norms $N(\\mathfrak{p}_{i})$ and exponents $e_{i}$ is\n$$\n|R/I| \\;=\\; \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\big(N(\\mathfrak{p}_{i})\\big)^{e_{i}}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\big(N(\\mathfrak{p}_{i})\\big)^{e_{i}}}$$", "id": "3021500"}]}
