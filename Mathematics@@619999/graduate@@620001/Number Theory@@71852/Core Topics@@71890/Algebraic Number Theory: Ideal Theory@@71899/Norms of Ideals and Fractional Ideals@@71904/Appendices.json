The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ has degree $2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is of order $2$, containing the identity map and the conjugation automorphism $\\sigma: K \\to K$ defined by $\\sigma(x+y\\sqrt{d}) = x-y\\sqrt{d}$ for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe field norm of an element $\\alpha \\in K$ is defined as the product of its Galois conjugates. For $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{d}$, its conjugate is $\\sigma(\\alpha) = a-b\\sqrt{d}$.\nTherefore, the field norm is:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\cdot \\sigma(\\alpha) = (a+b\\sqrt{d})(a-b\\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - (b\\sqrt{d})^2 = a^2 - db^2$$\nSince $a, b, d$ are integers, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{d})$ is always an integer.\n\nNext, we address the nature of the ideal $I = (a+b\\sqrt{d})\\mathcal{O}_K$. The problem statement refers to it as a fractional ideal. A fractional ideal is an $\\mathcal{O}_K$-submodule $J$ of $K$ such that there exists a non-zero $c \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ with $cJ \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$. An integral ideal is a fractional ideal that is a subset of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. A principal fractional ideal generated by $\\alpha \\in K$ is integral if and only if $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nLet's determine if the generator $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{d}$ is an algebraic integer, i.e., if $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. An element of a number field is an algebraic integer if and only if its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is monic with integer coefficients. For an element in a quadratic field, this is equivalent to its trace and norm being integers. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{d}$ (assuming $b \\neq 0$ so $\\alpha \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$) is:\n$$m(x) = (x - \\alpha)(x - \\sigma(\\alpha)) = x^2 - (\\alpha + \\sigma(\\alpha))x + \\alpha\\sigma(\\alpha) = x^2 - (2a)x + (a^2-db^2)$$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers by hypothesis, the coefficients of this monic polynomial, $-2a$ and $a^2-db^2$, are integers. Thus, $\\alpha=a+b\\sqrt{d}$ is an algebraic integer for any integers $a, b$. This means $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, and consequently, $I = (a+b\\sqrt{d})\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a principal integral ideal.\n\nThe absolute norm of a non-zero integral ideal $J \\subset \\mathcal{O}_K$ is defined as the cardinality of the quotient ring, $N(J) = |\\mathcal{O}_K / J|$. A fundamental theorem of algebraic number theory states that for a principal integral ideal $J = (\\alpha)$ generated by an element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, its norm is equal to the absolute value of the field norm of its generator:\n$$N((\\alpha)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$$\nThis can be justified by considering $\\mathcal{O}_K$ as a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $2$. The multiplication map $m_\\alpha: \\mathcal{O}_K \\to \\mathcal{O}_K$ defined by $x \\mapsto \\alpha x$ is a $\\mathbb{Z}$-linear endomorphism. Its image is the ideal $(\\alpha)$. The index of the image, $[\\mathcal{O}_K : (\\alpha)]$, which is the norm of the ideal, is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix representing $m_\\alpha$ with respect to any $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. This determinant is, by definition, the field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$.\n\nCombining these results, the absolute norm of the ideal $I = (a+b\\sqrt{d})\\mathcal{O}_K$ is:\n$$N(I) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{d})| = |a^2 - db^2|$$\nThis expression provides the required closed-form in terms of $a, b,$ and $d$.\n\nThe problem further asks to analyze the case $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and relate this norm to a binary quadratic form with respect to an integral basis. The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ has a different integral basis depending on $d \\pmod{4}$.\n\nCase 1: $d \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$, and a standard integral basis is $\\{1, \\sqrt{d}\\}$. An element $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is of the form $x \\cdot 1 + y \\cdot \\sqrt{d}$ with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The norm of such an element is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma) = x^2 - dy^2$. This is a binary quadratic form in the coordinates $(x,y)$. For our element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{d}$, its coordinates in this basis are $(a,b)$, so its norm is directly $a^2 - db^2$.\n\nCase 2: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right]$. A standard integral basis is $\\{1, \\omega\\}$, where $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$.\nAn arbitrary element $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ has the form $\\gamma = x \\cdot 1 + y \\cdot \\omega$ for unique integers $x,y$. Let's compute its field norm in terms of these coordinates $(x,y)$. The conjugate of $\\omega$ is $\\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{d}}{2}$.\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma) = (x+y\\omega)(x+y\\bar{\\omega}) = x^2 + xy(\\omega+\\bar{\\omega}) + y^2(\\omega\\bar{\\omega})$$\nWe have $\\omega+\\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2} + \\frac{1-\\sqrt{d}}{2} = 1$, and $\\omega\\bar{\\omega} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1-d}{4}$. Since $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $1-d$ is divisible by $4$, so $\\frac{1-d}{4}$ is an integer.\nThe norm is given by the binary quadratic form:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(x+y\\omega) = Q(x,y) = x^2 + xy + \\frac{1-d}{4}y^2$$\nNow we relate this to our original element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{d}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We must find its coordinates $(x,y)$ in the basis $\\{1, \\omega\\}$.\n$$a+b\\sqrt{d} = x + y\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right) = \\left(x+\\frac{y}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{d}$$\nEquating the coefficients of $\\sqrt{d}$ and the rational part:\n$\\frac{y}{2} = b \\implies y = 2b$\n$x+\\frac{y}{2} = a \\implies x+b=a \\implies x = a-b$\nSo the coordinates of $\\alpha=a+b\\sqrt{d}$ in the integral basis $\\{1, \\omega\\}$ are $(x,y) = (a-b, 2b)$. Since $a, b$ are integers, $x,y$ are also integers, which is consistent with $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nLet's substitute these coordinates back into the quadratic form $Q(x,y)$:\n$$Q(a-b, 2b) = (a-b)^2 + (a-b)(2b) + \\frac{1-d}{4}(2b)^2$$\n$$= (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) + (2ab - 2b^2) + \\frac{1-d}{4}(4b^2)$$\n$$= a^2 - 2ab + b^2 + 2ab - 2b^2 + (1-d)b^2$$\n$$= a^2 - b^2 + b^2 - db^2$$\n$$= a^2 - db^2$$\nThis confirms that the field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{d})$ evaluates to $a^2-db^2$, regardless of the basis used for the calculation. The two expressions are identities. The expression $a^2 - db^2$ is the general form of the field norm for an element expressed in the $\\mathbb{Q}$-basis $\\{1, \\sqrt{d}\\}$ of $K$, while the quadratic form $Q(x,y)$ is specific to the integral basis of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ when $d\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. The calculation shows their equivalence for any element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nIn conclusion, for any squarefree integer $d \\neq 0, 1$ and any integers $a, b$ (not both zero), the absolute norm of the principal ideal $(a+b\\sqrt{d})\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{d})|$.

By definition, $1+\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathfrak{a}$. Also, $1-\\sqrt{-5} = (1+\\sqrt{-5}) - 2\\sqrt{-5}$. Since $2$ is a generator of $\\mathfrak{a}$, the product $2\\sqrt{-5}$ is in $\\mathfrak{a}$. As $\\mathfrak{a}$ is closed under subtraction, $1-\\sqrt{-5}$ is also in $\\mathfrak{a}$. Therefore, the product $(1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5}) = 1 - (-5) = 6$ is in $\\mathfrak{a}^2$. Since $4$ is a generator of $\\mathfrak{a}^2$, it is also in the ideal. As $\\mathfrak{a}^2$ is closed under subtraction, the element $6-4=2$ must be in $\\mathfrak{a}^2$. Since $2 \\in \\mathfrak{a}^2$, the entire principal ideal $(2)$ is contained in $\\mathfrak{a}^2$.\nCombining the two inclusions, we conclude that $\\mathfrak{a}^2=(2)$.\n\nNow we compute $N(\\mathfrak{a}^2) = N((2))$ by index computation:\n$$ N((2)) = [\\mathcal{O}_K:(2)] = |\\mathcal{O}_K/2\\mathcal{O}_K| $$\nThe ideal $(2)$ is $2\\mathcal{O}_K = \\{ 2(x+y\\sqrt{-5}) \\mid x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} = \\{ 2x+2y\\sqrt{-5} \\mid x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\nAn element $x_1+y_1\\sqrt{-5}$ is congruent to $x_2+y_2\\sqrt{-5}$ modulo $(2)$ if their difference is in $(2)$.\n$$ (x_1-x_2)+(y_1-y_2)\\sqrt{-5} \\in 2\\mathcal{O}_K $$\nThis holds if and only if $x_1-x_2$ and $y_1-y_2$ are both even, i.e., $x_1\\equiv x_2 \\pmod 2$ and $y_1\\equiv y_2 \\pmod 2$.\nA coset representative is determined by the pair of residues $(x \\pmod 2, y \\pmod 2)$.

Since $11$ is also in the ideal, their greatest common divisor in $\\mathbb{Z}$, which is $1\n$, would also be in the ideal, implying the ideal is the entire ring $\\mathcal{O}_K$, which is not a prime ideal.\n\nNext, we exhibit these ideals as kernels of surjective ring homomorphisms from $\\mathcal{O}_K$ to $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$.\nAny element of $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ can be written as a polynomial in $\\alpha$ with integer coefficients. Since $\\alpha$ satisfies $x^2-x-1=0$, any such polynomial can be reduced to the form $a+b\\alpha$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet us define a map $\\phi_1: \\mathcal{O}_K \\to \\mathbb{F}_{11}$ by sending $\\alpha \\mapsto 8 \\pmod{11}$ and extending it as a ring homomorphism. For any element $P(\\alpha) \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ where $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, we define $\\phi_1(P(\\alpha)) = P(8) \\pmod{11}$. This map is well-defined because if $P(\\alpha) = Q(\\alpha)$, then $P(x)-Q(x)$ is a multiple of $m(x)=x^2-x-1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Since $m(8) = 8^2-8-1 = 55 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, the value of $P(8) \\pmod{11}$ is independent of the choice of polynomial representative.\nThe map $\\phi_1$ is a surjective ring homomorphism. To see surjectivity, note that for any $k \\in \\mathbb{F}_{11}$, we can choose the integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_K$. Then $\\phi_1(k) = k \\pmod{11}$.\nThe kernel of $\\phi_1$, denoted $\\ker(\\phi_1)$, consists of all elements $P(\\alpha) \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $P(8) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\nThe element $11 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is mapped to $11 \\pmod{11} = 0$, so $11 \\in \\ker(\\phi_1)$.\nThe element $\\alpha - 8 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is mapped to $8-8=0$, so $\\alpha-8 \\in \\ker(\\phi_1)$.\nTherefore, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (11, \\alpha-8)$ is contained in $\\ker(\\phi_1)$.\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings, $\\mathcal{O}_K / \\ker(\\phi_1) \\cong \\mathrm{Im}(\\phi_1) = \\mathbb{F}_{11}$. Since $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$ is a field, $\\ker(\\phi_1)$ is a maximal ideal, and thus a prime ideal.\nThe ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (11, \\alpha-8)$ is also a prime ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ lying above $(11)$. Since it is non-zero and contained in the maximal ideal $\\ker(\\phi_1)$, it must be that $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = \\ker(\\phi_1)$.\n\nSimilarly, we define a second homomorphism $\\phi_2: \\mathcal{O}_K \\to \\mathbb{F}_{11}$ by $\\alpha \\mapsto 4 \\pmod{11}$. This map is well-defined because $m(4) = 4^2-4-1=11 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. It is a surjective ring homomorphism by the same reasoning as for $\\phi_1$.\nThe kernel of $\\phi_2$ contains $11$ and $\\alpha-4$. Thus, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (11, \\alpha-4)$ is contained in $\\ker(\\phi_2)$. Again, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\ker(\\phi_2) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{11}$, so $\\ker(\\phi_2)$ is a maximal ideal. We conclude that $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = \\ker(\\phi_2)$.\nThis completes the first part of the problem, showing that $(11)$ splits into two distinct prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, which are the kernels of surjective homomorphisms onto $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the norm of these ideals. The definition of the norm of an ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) = |\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{a}|$, the cardinality of the quotient ring.\nFor the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (11, \\alpha-8)$, we have established that $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = \\ker(\\phi_1)$ and that $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{11}$.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the quotient ring is:\n$$ |\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_1| = |\\mathbb{F}_{11}| = 11 $$\nBy definition, the norm is:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}_1) = |\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_1| = 11 $$\nFor the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (11, \\alpha-4)$, we have shown that $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = \\ker(\\phi_2)$ and $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{11}$.\nThe cardinality of this quotient ring is:\n$$ |\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2| = |\\mathbb{F}_{11}| = 11 $$\nAnd its norm is:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = |\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2| = 11 $$\nBoth prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ lying above the rational prime $11$ have a norm of $11$. This is consistent with the general theory of prime ideal factorization, where for a split prime $p = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$, we have $N(\\mathfrak{p}_1) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = p$.\n\nThe common value of the norm for each prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ lying above $11$ is therefore $11$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{11} $$", "id": "3019817"}]}
