Thus $\\lambda_{2}(\\Lambda,K) \\leq 1/3$.\n\nWe must show that no $t<1/3$ can accommodate two independent lattice vectors.

Therefore the only nonzero lattice vectors lying in $tK$ for $t<1/3$ are of the form $(x_{1},0,0)$, which are all collinear and hence do not produce two independent vectors.

The task is a direct application of the definitions to a specific, non-trivial example. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and well-posed. There are no contradictions or missing information. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\nFor the specific case where the convex body is the Euclidean unit ball $K = B_{2}^{n}$, the condition that a vector $v$ is in $\\lambda K$ is equivalent to $\\|v\\|_{2} \\leq \\lambda$. The definition of the $i$-th successive minimum can be rephrased as: $\\lambda_{i}(B_{2}^{n}, \\Lambda)$ is the infimum of all $\\lambda > 0$ such that the closed ball of radius $\\lambda$ centered at the origin, $\\lambda B_{2}^{n}$, contains at least $i$ linearly independent vectors from the lattice $\\Lambda$.\n\nThis means we need to find the lengths of the $i$ shortest linearly independent vectors of the lattice.

Then, $\\lambda_i(B_{2}^{n}, \\Lambda) = \\|v_i\\|$ provided such a basis can be chosen greedily. More formally, $\\lambda_1$ is the length of the shortest non-zero vector, $\\lambda_2$ is the minimum radius $\\lambda$ of a ball containing two linearly independent vectors, and so on.\n\n**Successive Minima for the Standard Lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$**\n\nFirst, as a baseline, we compute the successive minima for the unsheared lattice $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. A vector in this lattice has the form $v = (m, n)$ where $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The squared Euclidean norm is $\\|v\\|_{2}^{2} = m^{2} + n^{2}$.\n\nTo find $\\lambda_{1}(B_{2}^{2}, \\mathbb{Z}^{2})$, we seek the shortest non-zero vector. We need to minimize $m^{2}+n^{2}$ for integers $(m,n) \\neq (0,0)$. The minimum value is $1$, which is achieved for example by $v = (1,0)$, giving $\\|v\\|_{2} = 1$. Thus, $\\lambda_{1}(B_{2}^{2}, \\mathbb{Z}^{2}) = 1$. The vectors of this minimal length are $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$.\n\nTo find $\\lambda_{2}(B_{2}^{2}, \\mathbb{Z}^{2})$, we need to find the smallest radius $\\lambda$ of a ball containing two linearly independent vectors. We can choose $v_{1} = (1,0)$ and $v_{2} = (0,1)$. Both are in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, are linearly independent, and have length $\\|v_1\\|_2 = \\|v_2\\|_2 = 1$. A ball of radius $\\lambda=1$ contains both of these vectors. We cannot find two linearly independent vectors in a ball of radius less than $1$. Therefore, $\\lambda_{2}(B_{2}^{2}, \\mathbb{Z}^{2}) = 1$.\n\n**Successive Minima for the Sheared Lattice $S_{1/2}\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$**\n\nNow we consider the lattice $\\Lambda' = S_{1/2}\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ where $S_{1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nA general vector $w \\in \\Lambda'$ is obtained by applying $S_{1/2}$ to a vector $v = (m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$:\n$$\nw = S_{1/2}v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} m \\\\ n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} m + \\frac{n}{2} \\\\ n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe squared norm of such a vector is:\n$$\n\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = \\left(m + \\frac{n}{2}\\right)^{2} + n^{2}\n$$\nwhere $m, n$ are integers.\n\nTo find $\\lambda_{1}(B_{2}^{2}, \\Lambda')$, we must find the minimum value of $\\|w\\|_{2}$ for $(m,n) \\neq (0,0)$. We analyze $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2}$ for small integer values of $n$:\n-   If $n=0$, $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = m^{2}$. The minimum non-zero value is $1$ for $m = \\pm 1$. This corresponds to the vectors $w = (\\pm 1, 0)$.\n-   If $n=\\pm 1$, $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = (m \\pm 1/2)^{2} + 1$. This expression is minimized when the term $(m \\pm 1/2)^{2}$ is minimized. For integer $m$, this occurs when $m=0$ or $m=\\mp 1$.\n    -   For $m=0$, $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = (\\pm 1/2)^{2} + 1 = 1/4 + 1 = 5/4$.\n    -   For $m=\\mp 1$, $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = (\\mp 1 \\pm 1/2)^{2} + 1 = (\\mp 1/2)^{2} + 1 = 5/4$.\n-   If $n=\\pm 2$, $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = (m \\pm 1)^{2} + 4$. This is minimized when $m = \\mp 1$, giving $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = 0^{2} + 4 = 4$.\n-   For larger $|n|$, the term $n^2$ ensures that $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2}$ will be larger than the values found so far.\n\nComparing the minimum squared norms found: $1$, $5/4$, $4$, $\\dots$, the smallest is $1$.\nThus, the length of the shortest non-zero vector in $\\Lambda'$ is $\\sqrt{1}=1$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}(B_{2}^{2}, S_{1/2}\\mathbb{Z}^{2}) = 1\n$$\nThe shortest non-zero vectors are $(\\pm 1, 0)$, corresponding to $(m,n) = (\\pm 1, 0)$.\n\nTo find $\\lambda_{2}(B_{2}^{2}, \\Lambda')$, we need to find the smallest radius $\\lambda$ that encloses two linearly independent vectors from $\\Lambda'$. Let's list the vectors of $\\Lambda'$ in increasing order of length:\n1.  Length $1$: $(\\pm 1, 0)$. These are generated by $v=(\\pm 1, 0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and are linearly dependent.\n2.  Length $\\sqrt{5/4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$: For $(m,n)=(0,\\pm 1)$, we get $w=(\\pm 1/2, \\pm 1)$. For $(m,n)=(\\mp 1, \\pm 1)$, we get $w=(\\mp 1/2, \\pm 1)$.\n\nWe must select two linearly independent vectors, $w_1$ and $w_2$. Let's start with a shortest vector, $w_1 = (1,0)$, which has length $1$. We now need to find the shortest vector $w_2$ in $\\Lambda'$ that is linearly independent of $w_1$. A vector $(x,y)$ is linearly independent of $(1,0)$ if and only if its second component $y$ is non-zero. For a vector $w = (m+n/2, n)$, this means we require $n \\neq 0$.\n\nWe seek to minimize $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2} = (m+n/2)^{2} + n^{2}$ under the constraint $n \\neq 0$. From our previous analysis, the minimum squared norm for $n \\neq 0$ is $5/4$, which occurs when $n=\\pm 1$ and $m=0$ or $m=\\mp 1$. Let's choose the vector corresponding to $(m,n)=(0,1)$, which is $w_2 = (1/2, 1)$. This vector is linearly independent from $w_1=(1,0)$, since $\\det(w_1, w_2) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe lengths of these two linearly independent vectors are $\\|w_1\\|_{2} = 1$ and $\\|w_2\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{5/4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. For a ball of radius $\\lambda$ to contain both $w_1$ and $w_2$, its radius must be at least $\\max(\\|w_1\\|_{2}, \\|w_2\\|_{2})$.\n$$\n\\lambda \\ge \\max\\left(1, \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{4} < \\sqrt{5}$, we have $2 < \\sqrt{5}$, which implies $1 < \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Therefore, the minimum required radius is $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Any ball with a smaller radius cannot contain both vectors. A ball of radius $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ contains the linearly independent vectors $(1,0)$ and $(1/2, 1)$.\nThus, the second successive minimum is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{2}(B_{2}^{2}, S_{1/2}\\mathbb{Z}^{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\n$$\n\nIn comparison, the successive minima for the unsheared lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ are $(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}) = (1,1)$. For the sheared lattice $S_{1/2}\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, they are $(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}) = (1, \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2})$. The first minimum remains unchanged, while the second minimum increases. This is because the shearing transformation preserved the vector $(1,0)$ but elongated the vector $(0,1)$ into $(1/2,1)$, which was the shortest vector linearly independent of $(1,0)$ in the original lattice.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer as the ordered pair $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ for the sheared lattice.

It is a standard exercise in the geometry of numbers, with all terms clearly defined and constraints being consistent. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the convex body $K_{\\epsilon}$ with respect to the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. We address each of the three tasks in sequence.\n\nFirst, we derive the volume of $K_{\\epsilon}$ and analyze its relationship with Minkowski's first theorem. The lattice is $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, which is a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Its fundamental parallelotope can be taken as the unit cube $[0,1)^{n}$, whose volume is $1$. Therefore, the determinant of the lattice is $\\det(\\Lambda) = 1$. Minkowski's first theorem states that an origin-symmetric convex body $K$ must contain a nonzero lattice point if its volume satisfies $\\operatorname{vol}(K) \\geq 2^{n} \\det(\\Lambda)$. For $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, this threshold is $2^{n}$.\n\nThe given convex body is $K_{\\epsilon} \\coloneqq \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid \\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 1 - \\epsilon \\}$, where $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$. The condition $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 1 - \\epsilon$ is equivalent to $\\max\\{|x_1|, |x_2|, \\dots, |x_n|\\} \\leq 1 - \\epsilon$. This describes the set of points $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ such that $-(1-\\epsilon) \\leq x_i \\leq 1-\\epsilon$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This is an $n$-dimensional hypercube centered at the origin. The length of each side is $(1-\\epsilon) - (-(1-\\epsilon)) = 2(1-\\epsilon)$. The volume of an $n$-dimensional hypercube with side length $s$ is $s^n$. Thus, the volume of $K_{\\epsilon}$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(K_{\\epsilon}) = (2(1-\\epsilon))^{n} = 2^{n}(1-\\epsilon)^{n}\n$$\nWe compare this volume to the Minkowski threshold $2^{n}$. Since $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, we have $0 < 1-\\epsilon < 1$, which implies $(1-\\epsilon)^{n} < 1$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{vol}(K_{\\epsilon}) < 2^{n}$. As the condition of Minkowski's first theorem is not met, the theorem does not guarantee the existence of a nonzero lattice point in $K_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nThe family of sets $K_{\\epsilon}$ for $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$ demonstrates that Minkowski's theorem is nearly tight. As the parameter $\\epsilon$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$), the volume $\\operatorname{vol}(K_{\\epsilon}) = 2^{n}(1-\\epsilon)^{n}$ approaches $2^{n}$. So, we have a family of convex bodies whose volumes can be made arbitrarily close to the critical value $2^{n}$, from below. As we will prove in the next part, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, these bodies contain no nonzero lattice points. This illustrates the sharpness of the constant $2^n$ in the theorem: if the volume is less than $2^n$, even by an arbitrarily small amount, the existence of a nonzero lattice point is not assured. The canonical example showing the tightness of the theorem is the open cube $(-1,1)^n$, which has volume $2^n$ but contains no nonzero points of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. The family $K_{\\epsilon}$ approaches the closed cube $[-1,1]^n$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, but for any $\\epsilon > 0$, it is strictly contained within $(-1,1)^n$.\n\nSecond, we prove that for each $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, the set $K_{\\epsilon}$ contains no nonzero lattice point of $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Let $x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ be a nonzero lattice point, i.e., $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. By definition, all components $x_i$ are integers, and at least one component, say $x_j$, is not zero. Since $x_j$ is a nonzero integer, its absolute value must be at least $1$, i.e., $|x_j| \\geq 1$. The infinity norm of $x$ is defined as $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\max_{i} |x_i|$. Therefore, for any nonzero $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, we have $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\geq 1$.\nNow, consider any point $y \\in K_{\\epsilon}$. By the definition of $K_{\\epsilon}$, we have $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 1-\\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, we have $1-\\epsilon < 1$.\nIf a nonzero lattice point $x$ were in $K_{\\epsilon}$, it would have to satisfy both $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\geq 1$ and $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 1-\\epsilon$. This implies $1 \\leq \\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 1-\\epsilon < 1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no nonzero point of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ can be in $K_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nThird, we compute the first successive minimum $\\lambda_{1}(K_{\\epsilon},\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$. By definition, $\\lambda_{1}(K,\\Lambda) = \\inf\\{\\lambda > 0 \\mid \\lambda K \\cap (\\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\neq \\emptyset\\}$. For our case, this is $\\lambda_{1}(K_{\\epsilon},\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\inf\\{\\lambda > 0 \\mid \\lambda K_{\\epsilon} \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\neq \\emptyset\\}$.\nThe scaled body $\\lambda K_{\\epsilon}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda K_{\\epsilon} = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid \\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\lambda(1-\\epsilon) \\}\n$$\nWe seek the infimum of $\\lambda > 0$ for which there exists a nonzero lattice point $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ such that $x \\in \\lambda K_{\\epsilon}$. This is equivalent to finding the infimum of $\\lambda > 0$ such that there exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ satisfying $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\lambda(1-\\epsilon)$. This inequality can be rearranged to $\\lambda \\geq \\frac{\\|x\\|_{\\infty}}{1-\\epsilon}$.\nTo find the smallest $\\lambda$ that satisfies this condition for at least one nonzero lattice point, we should choose the lattice point $x$ that minimizes the quantity $\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$. As established previously, the minimum value of $\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$ for any nonzero $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is exactly $1$. This minimum is achieved by vectors such as $(1,0,\\dots,0)$, $(-1,0,\\dots,0)$, $(1,1,0,\\dots,0)$, etc.\nLet $m = \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\|x\\|_{\\infty} = 1$. The condition for $\\lambda K_{\\epsilon}$ to contain at least one nonzero lattice point becomes $\\lambda(1-\\epsilon) \\geq m = 1$, which means $\\lambda \\geq \\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon}$.\nThe set of all $\\lambda > 0$ for which $\\lambda K_{\\epsilon}$ contains a nonzero lattice point is the interval $[\\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon}, \\infty)$. The infimum of this set is precisely its lower bound.\nTherefore, the exact value of the first successive minimum is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}(K_{\\epsilon},\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon}\n$$\nAs for its asymptotic behavior as $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$, we can observe that $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\lambda_{1}(K_{\\epsilon},\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon} = 1$. Using a Taylor expansion for small $\\epsilon$, we have $\\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon} = 1 + \\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 + O(\\epsilon^{3})$, which shows that $\\lambda_{1}$ approaches $1$ linearly with $\\epsilon$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon}}\n$$", "id": "3024202"}]}
