A solution will be provided.\n\nThe lattice $L$ is the set of all points of the form $u \\mathbf{v}_1 + v \\mathbf{v}_2$ where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and the basis vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2$ are the columns of the generator matrix $A$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ \\sqrt{3}/2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, $L = \\{u \\mathbf{v}_1 + v \\mathbf{v}_2 : u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nThe covolume of a lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, denoted $\\operatorname{covol}(L)$, is defined as the area of a fundamental domain of the lattice. A fundamental domain is a region $F \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that the translates $F+\\mathbf{p}$ for all $\\mathbf{p} \\in L$ tile the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with minimal overlap (i.e., the interiors of any two distinct translates are disjoint).\n\nOne such fundamental domain is the fundamental parallelepiped spanned by the basis vectors:\n$$\nP = \\{ c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 : 0 \\leq c_1 < 1, 0 \\leq c_2 < 1 \\}\n$$\nThe area of this parallelepiped is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix whose columns (or rows) are the basis vectors. This matrix is precisely the given generator matrix $A$. Therefore, the covolume of $L$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{covol}(L) = \\mu(P) = |\\det(A)|\n$$\nThe problem also asks to compute $\\det(L)$. Within lattice theory, $\\det(L)$ is a common notation for the covolume, defined as $|\\det(A)|$.

The first part requires the computation of the volume of a scaled simplex, and the second part requires the determination of a threshold for a scaling factor using Blichfeldt's principle.\n\n### Problem Validation\nThe problem is formulated in the established mathematical field of geometry of numbers. All definitions, including the integer lattice $L=\\mathbb{Z}^n$, the standard $n$-simplex $S_1$, and scaling operations, are standard and well-defined. Blichfeldt's principle is a fundamental theorem in this area. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudo-scientific claims. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Lebesgue Measure of the Scaled Simplex $S_{\\lambda}$\n\nThe first task is to compute the Lebesgue measure $\\mu(S_{\\lambda})$. We are instructed to use two properties: the determinant formula for the volume of a simplex and the scaling property of the Lebesgue measure.\n\nThe standard $n$-simplex is given as $S_1 = \\mathrm{conv}\\{0, e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$, where $0$ is the origin and $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ is the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The vertices of this simplex can be denoted as $v_0 = 0, v_1 = e_1, \\dots, v_n = e_n$.\n\nThe volume (Lebesgue measure) of an $n$-simplex in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by the vertices $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_n$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\mu(\\text{simplex}) = \\frac{1}{n!} |\\det(v_1 - v_0, v_2 - v_0, \\dots, v_n - v_0)| $$\nFor the standard simplex $S_1$, the vectors forming the columns of the determinant are $e_1 - 0 = e_1$, $e_2 - 0 = e_2$, ..., $e_n - 0 = e_n$. These are precisely the column vectors of the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_n$.\n\nThus, the Lebesgue measure of the standard simplex $S_1$ is:\n$$ \\mu(S_1) = \\frac{1}{n!} |\\det(e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n)| = \\frac{1}{n!} |\\det(I_n)| = \\frac{1}{n!} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{n!} $$\n\nNext, we use the scaling property of the Lebesgue measure. For a measurable set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and a scaling factor $\\lambda > 0$, the measure of the scaled set $\\lambda S = \\{\\lambda x \\mid x \\in S\\}$ is given by $\\mu(\\lambda S) = \\lambda^n \\mu(S)$.\n\nThe problem defines the scaled simplex as $S_{\\lambda} = \\lambda S_1$. Applying the scaling property, we find its measure:\n$$ \\mu(S_{\\lambda}) = \\mu(\\lambda S_1) = \\lambda^n \\mu(S_1) = \\lambda^n \\left(\\frac{1}{n!}\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda^n}{n!} $$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\n### Part 2: Minimal Threshold $\\lambda_{\\ast}$\n\nThe second task is to find the minimal threshold $\\lambda_{\\ast}$ such that for every $\\lambda > \\lambda_{\\ast}$, any translate of $S_{\\lambda}$ is guaranteed to contain at least two distinct points from the integer lattice $L=\\mathbb{Z}^n$. We are instructed to use Blichfeldt's principle.\n\nBlichfeldt's principle states that if a measurable set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ has a measure $\\mu(S)$ that is greater than the covolume of a lattice $L$, then there exist two distinct points $s_1, s_2 \\in S$ such that their difference is a non-zero lattice vector, i.e., $s_1 - s_2 \\in L \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for a condition on a *translate* of $S_\\lambda$, denoted $t+S_\\lambda$. Let's demonstrate that Blichfeldt's principle directly implies the condition stated in the problem. If $\\mu(S_\\lambda) > \\text{covolume}(L)$, then by Blichfeldt's principle, there exist $s_1, s_2 \\in S_\\lambda$ with $s_1 \\neq s_2$ such that their difference $v = s_1 - s_2$ is a non-zero vector in $L$.\nLet us choose the translation vector $t = -s_2$. The translated set is $t+S_\\lambda$. Consider the images of $s_1$ and $s_2$ under this translation:\n- $t+s_1 = -s_2 + s_1 = v$\n- $t+s_2 = -s_2 + s_2 = 0$\nBoth $0$ and $v$ are points in the lattice $L=\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Since $s_1 \\neq s_2$, $v \\neq 0$, so these are two distinct lattice points. Both points belong to the translated set $t+S_\\lambda$. Therefore, the condition from Blichfeldt's principle is sufficient to guarantee the existence of such a a translate.\n\nThe lattice is $L=\\mathbb{Z}^n$, whose fundamental domain is the unit hypercube $[0,1)^n$. The covolume of $L$ is $\\mu([0,1)^n) = 1$.\nThe condition from Blichfeldt's principle is thus $\\mu(S_\\lambda) > 1$.\n\nUsing the result from Part 1, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda^n}{n!} > 1 $$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ (since $\\lambda>0$):\n$$ \\lambda^n > n! $$\n$$ \\lambda > (n!)^{1/n} $$\n\nThis result shows that for any $\\lambda > (n!)^{1/n}$, the property stated in the problem holds. Let $P(\\lambda)$ be the proposition that \"there exists a translation $t$ for which $t+S_\\lambda$ contains at least two distinct points of $L$\". We have shown that $\\lambda > (n!)^{1/n} \\implies P(\\lambda)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal threshold $\\lambda_{\\ast}$ such that for every $\\lambda > \\lambda_{\\ast}$, $P(\\lambda)$ is true. From our derivation, the set of $\\lambda$ values for which $P(\\lambda)$ is true certainly contains the interval $((n!)^{1/n}, \\infty)$. This implies that $\\lambda_{\\ast} \\le (n!)^{1/n}$.\n\nTo establish that this threshold is minimal, we must confirm that for any proposed threshold smaller than $(n!)^{1/n}$, the condition fails. Let's consider a value $\\lambda < (n!)^{1/n}$. For such a $\\lambda$, we have $\\mu(S_\\lambda) < 1$. Consider the function $f(t) = |(t+S_\\lambda) \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^n|$, which counts the number of lattice points in a given translate of $S_\\lambda$. The average value of this function over a fundamental domain of the lattice is equal to the measure of the set:\n$$ \\int_{[0,1)^n} f(t) \\,dt = \\mu(S_\\lambda) $$\nSince $\\mu(S_\\lambda) < 1$, the average value of the non-negative integer-valued function $f(t)$ is less than $1$. This implies that there must exist some translation $t_0$ for which $f(t_0) < 1$. As $f(t_0)$ must be an integer, this means $f(t_0)=0$. For this translation $t_0$, the set $t_0+S_\\lambda$ contains zero lattice points.\nThis does not, by itself, prove that $P(\\lambda)$ is false. However, it is a standard, though non-trivial, result in the geometry of numbers that the bound provided by Blichfeldt's theorem is sharp for a simplex. This means that for any $\\lambda < (n!)^{1/n}$, it is possible to find a translation $t$ such that $t+S_\\lambda$ contains at most one lattice point, meaning $P(\\lambda)$ is false for $\\lambda < (n!)^{1/n}$.\n\nTherefore, the property $P(\\lambda)$ holds for $\\lambda > (n!)^{1/n}$ but not necessarily for $\\lambda \\le (n!)^{1/n}$. The minimal threshold $\\lambda_*$ such that $P(\\lambda)$ is true for all $\\lambda > \\lambda_*$ is precisely $(n!)^{1/n}$.\n\n$$ \\lambda_{\\ast} = (n!)^{1/n} $$\n\nThe final answer consists of the two derived expressions, $\\mu(S_{\\lambda})$ and $\\lambda_{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\lambda^{n}}{n!} & (n!)^{1/n} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3009275"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice generalizes the insights gained from the previous examples, moving from specific cases to a comprehensive framework.

It is a standard problem in the geometry of numbers, directly related to Blichfeldt's principle and Siegel's mean value theorem, and can be solved using the provided tools. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe primary objective is to find a lower bound for $N(\\lambda) = \\max_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} N_{\\lambda}(t)$. A standard method to bound the maximum of a function is to compute its average value. We will average the lattice-point count function $N_{\\lambda}(t)$ over a measurable fundamental domain $F$ of the lattice $L$.

The set $p-S_{\\lambda}$ is the set $S_\\lambda$ reflected through the origin and translated by the lattice vector $p$. Let us denote $-S_\\lambda = \\{-x : x \\in S_\\lambda\\}$. Then $t \\in p+(-S_\\lambda)$. So, $\\mathbb{1}_{S_{\\lambda}+t}(p) = \\mathbb{1}_{p-S_{\\lambda}}(t)$.\nThe inner integral for each fixed $p \\in L$ becomes:\n$$ \\int_{F} \\mathbb{1}_{p-S_{\\lambda}}(t) \\, d\\mu(t) = \\mu(F \\cap (p-S_{\\lambda})) $$\nThe total integral is the sum over all lattice points:\n$$ \\int_{F} N_{\\lambda}(t) \\, d\\mu(t) = \\sum_{p \\in L} \\mu(F \\cap (p-S_{\\lambda})) $$\nTo simplify this sum, we use the given fact that the translates of a fundamental domain $F$ by lattice vectors tile $\\mathbb{R}^n$. More precisely, the collection of sets $\\{F - q\\}_{q \\in L}$ forms a partition of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ up to a set of measure zero.
