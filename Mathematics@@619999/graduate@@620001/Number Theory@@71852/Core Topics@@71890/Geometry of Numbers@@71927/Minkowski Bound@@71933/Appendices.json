There are no integer solutions, so $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not principal. Its class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is an element of order $2$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}_K$. This shows $h_K$ is even and $h_K \\ge 2$.\n  - For $p=3$: Since $3 \\mid \\Delta_K$, $3$ ramifies. $(3) = \\mathfrak{p}_3^2$, where $\\mathfrak{p}_3 = (3, \\sqrt{-21})$. We check if $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ is principal by looking for an element of norm $3$. $a^2+21b^2=3$ has no integer solutions. Thus, $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ is not principal, and $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$ has order $2$.\n  - For $p=5$: We check the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{\\Delta_K/4}{5}) = (\\frac{-21}{5}) = (\\frac{4}{5}) = 1$. So $5$ splits. $(5) = \\mathfrak{p}_5 \\mathfrak{p}_5'$. An element of norm $5$, $a^2+21b^2=5$, does not exist, so $\\mathfrak{p}_5$ is also not principal.\n\n  A preliminary analysis reveals several non-principal ideal classes. Without checking the relations between them, one might plausibly be uncertain if they represent one or more distinct non-trivial classes. For instance, if $[\\mathfrak{p}_2] = [\\mathfrak{p}_3] = [\\mathfrak{p}_5]$, then $h_K$ could be $2$. If $[\\mathfrak{p}_2] \\neq [\\mathfrak{p}_3]$, then the class group contains a subgroup isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$, implying $4 \\mid h_K$. The claim that the initial analysis \"cannot decide whether $h_K=2$ or $h_K=4$\" is a reasonable description of this situation before a full analysis of relations is performed.\n\n- **Refinement with Genus Theory**: The option proposes using Dirichlet's genus theory. The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = -84 = -4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. It has $t=3$ distinct prime factors ($2, 3, 7$). For an imaginary quadratic field, the number of genera equals the size of the $2$-torsion subgroup $\\mathrm{Cl}_K[2]$ and is given by $2^{t-1}$.\nHere, $\\lvert\\mathrm{Cl}_K[2]\\rvert = 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4$.\nThis means the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}_K$ has a subgroup of order $4$ (specifically, the subgroup of elements of order $1$ or $2$). By Lagrange's theorem, the order of the class group, $h_K$, must be a multiple of $4$. This correctly rules out $h_K=2$. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Confirmation**: The option correctly states that one can confirm $h_K=4$ by other methods. Counting the reduced positive definite binary quadratic forms of discriminant $-84$ is a standard method that yields $4$ forms: $(1,0,21)$, $(3,0,7)$, $(2,2,11)$, and $(5,4,5)$. Thus, $h_K=4$. The analytic class number formula is also a valid, albeit more advanced, method.\n\nThe description of the field, the ambiguity, the refinement, and the conclusion in this option are all mathematically correct.\n\n### Analysis of Option B\n\n- **Field**: The field is $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. This is a real quadratic field. The problem explicitly asks for an *imaginary* quadratic field. This option fails to meet a primary condition.\n- **Minkowski Bound and Ambiguity**: For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, the discriminant is $\\Delta_K = 5$, and the Minkowski bound is $M_K = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{5} \\approx 1.118$. Since there are no rational primes $p \\leq M_K$, the class group is generated by an empty set of prime ideals, which directly implies the class group is trivial and $h_K=1$. There is no ambiguity. The claim that it is \"inconclusive between $h_K=1$ and $h_K=2$\" is false.\n\nThis option is incorrect.\n\n### Analysis of Option C\n\n- **Field and Discriminant**: Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-39})$. Since $-39 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the discriminant is $\\Delta_K = -39$. This is correct. The Minkowski bound is $M_K = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{39} \\approx 3.975$, so we check primes $p=2, 3$.\n\n- **Initial Analysis and Ambiguity**:\n  - For $p=3$: Since $3 \\mid \\Delta_K$, $3$ ramifies. $(3) = \\mathfrak{p}_3^2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-39}}{2}]$. An element $\\alpha = a+b(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-39}}{2})$ has norm $N(\\alpha) = (a+\\frac{b}{2})^2 + \\frac{39}{4}b^2 = a^2+ab+10b^2$. There is no integer solution to $a^2+ab+10b^2=3$, so $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ is not principal. Its class $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$ has order $2$.\n  - The existence of an element of order $2$ implies that $h_K$ must be an even number. The option's claim that $h_K \\in \\{2,3\\}$ is plausible is incorrect, as $h_K=3$ is impossible.\n\n- **Refinement with Genus Theory**: The option claims that genus theory shows $h_K$ must be odd. Let's verify this. The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = -39 = (-1) \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13$. The number of distinct prime factors is $t=2$ (namely $3$ and $13$). According to genus theory, $\\lvert\\mathrm{Cl}_K[2]\\rvert = 2^{t-1} = 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2$. This implies the class number $h_K$ is even, directly contradicting the option's claim.\n\nThis option is incorrect due to a flawed initial premise and a factually wrong statement about genus theory. (For the record, the class number of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-39})$ is $4$).\n\n### Analysis of Option D\n\n- **Field and Discriminant**: Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-105})$. Since $-105 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $\\Delta_K = 4(-105)=-420$. The Minkowski bound is $M_K = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{420} \\approx 13.04$. The option correctly states this requires checking primes $p \\leq 13$.\n\n- **Initial Analysis and Ambiguity**: The discriminant $\\Delta_K = -420 = -4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$ has $t=4$ distinct prime factors ($2,3,5,7$). All these primes ramify.\n  - The prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_2, \\mathfrak{p}_3, \\mathfrak{p}_5, \\mathfrak{p}_7$ all have order $2$ in the class group, provided they are not principal. For $\\alpha=a+b\\sqrt{-105}$, the norm is $N(\\alpha)=a^2+105b^2$. Clearly, $a^2+105b^2=p$ has no integer solution for $p \\in \\{2,3,5,7\\}$. So these are all non-principal ideals.\n  - A quick application of genus theory shows $\\lvert\\mathrm{Cl}_K[2]\\rvert = 2^{t-1} = 2^{4-1}=8$. This means $8 \\mid h_K$.\n  - The premise that the analysis leaves $h_K \\in \\{2,4\\}$ plausible is a severe understatement and thus incorrect. Even a basic analysis of ramified primes points to a $2$-rank of at least $3$ (since $(\\sqrt{-105}) = \\mathfrak{p}_3\\mathfrak{p}_5\\mathfrak{p}_7$ provides one relation), implying $h_K$ is a multiple of $2^3=8$.\n\n- **Refinement**: The option suggests using the Rédei–Reichardt matrix. This method determines the $4$-rank of the class group. The $4$-rank of $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-105}))$ is $0$. Combined with the $2$-rank of $3$, this implies the $2$-Sylow subgroup is isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, confirming that $8 \\mid h_K$. The class number is in fact $h_K = 8$. The option's claim that this method shows $h_K=4$ is incorrect.\n\nThis option is incorrect because both its premise about plausibility and its conclusion from the refined method are false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is the only one that presents a mathematically sound scenario. The ambiguity described is plausible in an initial investigation, and the proposed refinement (genus theory) is correctly stated, applied, and resolves the issue as claimed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3017755"}]}
