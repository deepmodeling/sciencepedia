Determine $\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$**\n\nThe Dirichlet–Voronoi cell of $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ at the origin, denoted $\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$, is the set of all points $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that are at least as close to the origin $0$ as to any other lattice point $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. The defining condition is $|y| \\leq |y - x|$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. As the condition is trivial for $x=0$, we consider $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nSince the Euclidean norm is non-negative, we can square the inequality:\n$$|y|^{2} \\leq |y - x|^{2}$$\nLet $y = (y_1, \\dots, y_n)$ and $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ where each $x_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Expanding the norms in terms of coordinates:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}^{2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - x_{i})^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i}^{2} - 2y_{i}x_{i} + x_{i}^{2})$$\nSubtracting $\\sum y_{i}^{2}$ from both sides yields:\n$$0 \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (-2y_{i}x_{i} + x_{i}^{2}) = -2\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}x_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}$$\nThis is equivalent to $2\\langle y, x \\rangle \\leq |x|^2$. This inequality must hold for every non-zero $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$.\n\nThe problem simplifies by considering the lattice points closest to the origin. These are the vectors with a single non-zero component equal to $\\pm 1$. Let's denote the standard basis vectors as $e_1, \\dots, e_n$. The nearest neighbors to the origin are the $2n$ vectors $\\{\\pm e_1, \\dots, \\pm e_n\\}$.\nFor $x = e_k$ (the vector with a $1$ in the $k$-th position and $0$s elsewhere), the inequality becomes $2\\langle y, e_k \\rangle \\leq |e_k|^2$, which is $2y_k \\leq 1$, or $y_k \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor $x = -e_k$, the inequality becomes $2\\langle y, -e_k \\rangle \\leq |-e_k|^2$, which is $-2y_k \\leq 1$, or $y_k \\geq -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nCombining these conditions for $k=1, \\dots, n$, we find that any point $y \\in \\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ must satisfy $-\\frac{1}{2} \\leq y_k \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ for all $k$. This defines the hypercube $C = [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]^{n}$.\n\nWe must verify that any point $y \\in C$ satisfies the condition $2\\langle y, x \\rangle \\leq |x|^2$ for all non-zero $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$.\n$|x|^2 - 2\\langle y, x \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2 - 2y_i x_i)$.\nFor each term $i$, if $x_i \\neq 0$, then $|x_i| \\geq 1$. Since $-\\frac{1}{2} \\leq y_i \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $|2y_i x_i| \\leq |x_i|$.\nSpecifically, if $x_i  0$, $x_i^2 - 2y_i x_i \\geq x_i^2 - x_i = x_i(x_i-1) \\geq 0$ since $x_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $x_i\\ge 1$.\nIf $x_i  0$, $x_i^2 - 2y_i x_i \\geq x_i^2 + x_i = (-x_i)^2 - (-x_i) \\geq 0$ since $-x_i \\ge 1$.\nIf $x_i = 0$, the term is $0$.\nThus, each term $(x_i^2 - 2y_i x_i)$ is non-negative, so their sum is non-negative. The inequality holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ is precisely the unit hypercube centered at the origin:\n$$\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]^{n}$$\n\n**2. Compute $V(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$**\n\nThe covolume $V(L)$ is the volume of any fundamental domain of $L$. Since $\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ is a fundamental domain for $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, its volume is the covolume.\n$\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ is a hypercube with side length $s = \\frac{1}{2} - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$. The volume of an $n$-dimensional hypercube with side length $s$ is $s^{n}$.\n$$V(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\operatorname{Vol}(\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})) = 1^{n} = 1$$\nAlternatively, the standard basis for $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is given by the columns of the $n \\times n$ identity matrix $I_n$. The covolume is $V(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = |\\det(I_n)| = 1$.\n\n**3. Determine $r(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ and $\\mu(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$**\n\nThe packing radius $r(L)$ is the inradius of $\\operatorname{Vor}(L)$, and the covering radius $\\mu(L)$ is the circumradius of $\\operatorname{Vor}(L)$.\n\nFor the packing radius $r(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$, we use the definition $r(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$. Here, $\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ is the length of the shortest non-zero vector in $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. For any non-zero vector $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, its squared length is $|x|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. Since $x \\neq 0$, at least one integer component $x_i$ is non-zero, so $x_i^2 \\geq 1$. Thus, $|x|^2 \\geq 1$. This minimum is achieved for vectors such as $(1,0,\\dots,0)$. So, $\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = 1$.\n$$r(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis corresponds to the inradius of the hypercube $[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]^n$, which is the radius of the largest inscribed ball. This ball is tangent to the faces of the hypercube, which are located at coordinates $y_i=\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$. The distance from the origin to any of these faces is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor the covering radius $\\mu(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$, we find the circumradius of $\\operatorname{Vor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]^n$. This is the distance from the origin to the furthest point in the cell. The furthest points are the vertices of the hypercube, which have coordinates $(\\pm\\frac{1}{2}, \\pm\\frac{1}{2}, \\dots, \\pm\\frac{1}{2})$.\nThe distance of any such vertex from the origin is:\n$$\\mu(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\dots + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{n \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$$\n\n**4. Compute $\\rho(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$**\n\nThe ratio $\\rho(L)$ is defined as $\\mu(L)/r(L)$. For $L = \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$:\n$$\\rho(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\frac{\\mu(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})}{r(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}/2}{1/2} = \\sqrt{n}$$\n\n**5. Extremal Property of $\\rho$**\n\nLet $L_A = A\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ where $A = \\operatorname{diag}(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ with $a_i  0$ and $\\det(A) = \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i = 1$.\nThe vectors in $L_A$ are of the form $(a_1 x_1, \\dots, a_n x_n)$ for $x_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe shortest non-zero vector length $\\lambda_1(L_A)$ is $\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i x_i)^2}$. The minimum is achieved when one $x_i = \\pm 1$ and others are $0$. The squared lengths are $a_1^2, \\dots, a_n^2$. Thus, $\\lambda_1(L_A) = \\min_i\\{a_i\\}$. The packing radius is $r(L_A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_i\\{a_i\\}$.\nThe Voronoi cell $\\operatorname{Vor}(L_A)$ is the orthotope $[-\\frac{a_1}{2}, \\frac{a_1}{2}] \\times \\dots \\times [-\\frac{a_n}{2}, \\frac{a_n}{2}]$. The covering radius $\\mu(L_A)$ is the distance from the origin to a vertex $(\\pm\\frac{a_1}{2}, \\dots, \\pm\\frac{a_n}{2})$, which is $\\mu(L_A) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\frac{a_i}{2})^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\rho(L_A) = \\frac{\\mu(L_A)}{r(L_A)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\sum a_i^2}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\min_i\\{a_i\\}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum a_i^2}}{\\min_i\\{a_i\\}}$$\nWe wish to prove $\\rho(L_A) \\geq \\rho(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}) = \\sqrt{n}$. Let $a_k = \\min_i\\{a_i\\}$. Then\n$$\\rho(L_A)^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}{a_k^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{a_i}{a_k}\\right)^2$$\nSince $a_k$ is the minimum, $a_i/a_k \\geq 1$ for all $i$. Thus, $(a_i/a_k)^2 \\geq 1$.\nThe sum is therefore a sum of $n$ terms, each of which is at least $1$.\n$$\\rho(L_A)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{a_i}{a_k}\\right)^2 \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 = n$$\nTaking the square root gives $\\rho(L_A) \\geq \\sqrt{n}$.\nEquality holds if and only if every term in the sum is exactly $1$, i.e., $(a_i/a_k)^2 = 1$ for all $i$. This implies $a_i = a_k$ for all $i$. So all $a_i$ must be equal to a constant $c$. The condition $\\prod a_i = 1$ becomes $c^n = 1$, which implies $c=1$ since $a_i  0$. Thus, equality holds if and only if $a_i = 1$ for all $i$, meaning $A=I_n$ and $L_A = \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The statement that $A$ is a scalar multiple of the identity is correct; combined with $\\det(A)=1$, it implies $A=I_n$. The parenthetical remark about \"rotated copy\" is slightly imprecise for a general diagonal matrix but is true for $A=I_n$.\n\nTo show that $\\rho(\\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ is not extremal among all lattices, we cite a counterexample. In dimension $n=2$, compare the square lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with the hexagonal lattice, often denoted $A_2$.\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\\rho(\\mathbb{Z}^2) = \\sqrt{2}$.\nFor the hexagonal lattice $A_2$ with shortest vector length $\\lambda_1=s$, the packing radius is $r(A_2) = s/2$. Its Voronoi cell is a regular hexagon. The covering radius $\\mu(A_2)$ is the distance from the center to a vertex of this hexagon, which is $s/\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe ratio is $\\rho(A_2) = \\frac{\\mu(A_2)}{r(A_2)} = \\frac{s/\\sqrt{3}}{s/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe compare $\\rho(A_2) = 2/\\sqrt{3}$ with $\\rho(\\mathbb{Z}^2) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n$(2/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4/3$ and $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$.\nSince $4/3  2$, we have $\\rho(A_2)  \\rho(\\mathbb{Z}^2)$. This demonstrates that the standard integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ does not minimize the ratio $\\rho$ among all possible lattices, even though it does among unimodular rectangular lattices.

A sphere packing can be associated with $L$ by placing identical, non-overlapping spheres centered at each point of the lattice. For the spheres not to overlap, their radius $r$ must be at most half the minimum distance between any two distinct points of the lattice. This minimum distance is, by definition, the first successive minimum $\\lambda_1(L)$. Therefore, the maximum radius of the spheres in such a packing is $r = \\frac{\\lambda_1(L)}{2}$.\n\nThe density of this lattice packing, $\\delta(L)$, is defined as the fraction of space covered by the spheres.

We zero out the second entry.\nPerform $C_{3} \\to C_{3} - C_{2}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  -8  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo make the diagonal entry positive, we can perform $C_{2} \\to -C_{2}$:\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  8  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is the Smith Normal Form of $G$. The diagonal entries are the invariant factors of $L$ as a submodule of $L_{0}$: $d_{1}=1$ and $d_{2}=8$. The rank of the lattice $L$ is $2$, which is the number of non-zero invariant factors.\n\nThe SNF theorem states that there exists a basis $\\mathcal{B}' = \\{b'_{1}, b'_{2}\\}$ for $L_{0}$ and a basis $\\{l_{1}, l_{2}\\}$ for $L$ such that $l_{1} = d_{1}b'_{1}$ and $l_{2} = d_{2}b'_{2}$.\n\nThe covolume of a lattice is the volume of its fundamental parallelepiped. We can calculate the covolume of $L$ using the index of the sublattice. The covolume of $L$ is related to the covolume of $L_{0}$ by the formula:\n$$ \\text{covol}(L) = [L_{0} : L] \\cdot \\text{covol}(L_{0}) $$\nThe covolume of $L_{0}$ is given by its basis matrix $B_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$ \\text{covol}(L_{0}) = |\\det(B_{0})| = |2 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1| = |3| = 3 $$\nThe index of the sublattice, $[L_{0} : L]$, is the order of the quotient group $L_{0}/L$. The structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a PID (like $\\mathbb{Z}$) states that this index is the product of the invariant factors from the SNF.\n$$ [L_{0} : L] = |L_{0}/L| = \\prod_{i} d_{i} = d_{1} \\cdot d_{2} = 1 \\cdot 8 = 8 $$\nTherefore, the covolume of $L$ is:\n$$ \\text{covol}(L) = 8 \\cdot 3 = 24 $$\nTo confirm, we can also find a basis for $L$ in Euclidean coordinates and compute the determinant. One such basis for $L$ can be constructed from the column operations, which gives $\\{l_1, l_2\\} = \\{(7, 5), (40, 32)\\}$. The basis matrix is $B_{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7  40 \\\\ 5  32 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$ \\text{covol}(L) = |\\det(B_{L})| = |7 \\cdot 32 - 40 \\cdot 5| = |224 - 200| = |24| = 24 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "3016978"}]}
