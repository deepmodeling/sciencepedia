We will address each task in sequence.\n\n### Task 1: Compute $\\operatorname{area}(B)$\n\nThe set $B$ is defined in the $y$-plane as $B=\\{(y_{1},y_{2})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\ |y_{i}|\\leq b_{i}\\ \\text{for}\\ i=1,2\\}$. The inequalities defining $B$ are $|y_1| \\le b_1$ and $|y_2| \\le b_2$. These are equivalent to the conditions $-b_1 \\le y_1 \\le b_1$ and $-b_2 \\le y_2 \\le b_2$. This describes a closed rectangle centered at the origin of the $\\mathbb{R}^2$ Cartesian plane.\n\nThe length of the interval for the $y_1$ coordinate is $b_1 - (-b_1) = 2b_1$.\nThe length of the interval for the $y_2$ coordinate is $b_2 - (-b_2) = 2b_2$.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is the product of the lengths of its sides. Therefore, the area of $B$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{area}(B) = (2b_1)(2b_2) = 4b_1b_2\n$$\n\n### Task 2: Derive the sharp threshold condition\n\nThe goal is to find the condition on $b_1, b_2$ and the matrix entries $a,b,c,d$ under which the set $S = \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\ |L_{i}(x)|\\leq b_{i}\\ \\text{for}\\ i=1,2\\}$ must contain a nonzero integer point $(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$. We must use the provided Minkowski convex body theorem.\n\nFirst, we verify that the set $S$ satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem.\n1.  **Convexity**: The set $S$ is defined by the four linear inequalities $-b_1 \\le ax_1+bx_2 \\le b_1$ and $-b_2 \\le cx_1+dx_2 \\le b_2$. Each of these inequalities defines a closed half-plane in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A half-plane is a convex set. The set $S$ is the intersection of these four convex sets, and the intersection of convex sets is always convex. Thus, $S$ is a convex set (specifically, a closed centrally symmetric parallelogram).\n2.  **Central Symmetry**: A set $K$ is centrally symmetric if for every point $x \\in K$, the point $-x$ is also in $K$. Let $x=(x_1, x_2)$ be an arbitrary point in $S$. This means $|L_1(x)| \\le b_1$ and $|L_2(x)| \\le b_2$. The linear forms are $L_1(-x) = a(-x_1) + b(-x_2) = -(ax_1+bx_2) = -L_1(x)$ and similarly $L_2(-x) = -L_2(x)$. Taking the absolute value, we get $|L_1(-x)| = |-L_1(x)| = |L_1(x)|$ and $|L_2(-x)| = |-L_2(x)| = |L_2(x)|$. Since $x \\in S$, we have $|L_i(x)| \\le b_i$, which implies $|L_i(-x)| \\le b_i$ for $i=1,2$. Therefore, $-x \\in S$, and the set $S$ is centrally symmetric.\n\nHaving confirmed that $S$ is a centrally symmetric, convex set, we can apply the provided version of Minkowski's theorem. It states that $S$ is guaranteed to contain a nonzero integer point if $\\operatorname{area}(S) > 4$.\n\nNext, we calculate $\\operatorname{area}(S)$. The set $S$ is defined as the preimage of $B$ under the linear map $A$, i.e., $S = A^{-1}B$. This is equivalent to $A(S) = B$. Using the provided area scaling principle for the linear transformation $T=A$ and the set $E=S$, we have:\n$$\n\\operatorname{area}(A(S)) = |\\det A| \\cdot \\operatorname{area}(S)\n$$\nSubstituting $A(S) = B$, we get:\n$$\n\\operatorname{area}(B) = |\\det A| \\cdot \\operatorname{area}(S)\n$$\nSince the matrix $A$ is nonsingular, $\\det A \\neq 0$, so we can solve for $\\operatorname{area}(S)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{area}(S) = \\frac{\\operatorname{area}(B)}{|\\det A|}\n$$\nThe condition from the theorem, $\\operatorname{area}(S) > 4$, becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{area}(B)}{|\\det A|} > 4\n$$\nThis is the sufficient condition expressed in terms of $\\operatorname{area}(B)$ and $|\\det A|$. The problem asks for the \"sharp threshold condition\" and to verify its equivalence to $b_1b_2 \\ge |\\det A|$. The strict inequality version of Minkowski's theorem must be extended to include the boundary case $\\operatorname{area}(S) = 4$. This is a standard result for compact sets, which $S$ is (being closed and bounded). The argument proceeds by considering a slightly larger set.\n\nIf $\\operatorname{area}(S) = 4$, we can define for any $\\epsilon > 0$ a new set $S_{\\epsilon} = (1+\\epsilon)S$, which corresponds to replacing $b_i$ with $b_i' = b_i(1+\\epsilon)$. The area of this new set is $\\operatorname{area}(S_{\\epsilon}) = (1+\\epsilon)^2 \\operatorname{area}(S) = 4(1+\\epsilon)^2$, which is strictly greater than $4$. By the theorem, for each $\\epsilon > 0$, $S_{\\epsilon}$ contains a nonzero integer point $z_{\\epsilon}$. All such points must lie in a fixed bounded region (e.g., $S_1$ for $\\epsilon=1$), which contains only finitely many integer points. Thus, there must be one integer point $z^*$ that is selected for a sequence of $\\epsilon$ values approaching $0$. This point $z^*$ satisfies the inequalities $|L_i(z^*)| \\le b_i(1+\\epsilon)$ for all these values of $\\epsilon$. By taking the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we conclude that $|L_i(z^*)| \\le b_i$, which means $z^*$ is in $S$.\n\nTherefore, the sharp condition guaranteeing a nonzero integer point in the closed set $S$ is $\\operatorname{area}(S) \\ge 4$. This translates to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{area}(B)}{|\\det A|} \\ge 4\n$$\nNow, we substitute the result from Task 1, $\\operatorname{area}(B) = 4b_1b_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{4b_1b_2}{|\\det A|} \\ge 4\n$$\nSince $4 > 0$, we can divide by $4$. As $A$ is nonsingular, $|\\det A| > 0$, so we can multiply by $|\\det A|$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$\nb_1b_2 \\ge |\\det A|\n$$\nThis completes the verification.\n\n### Task 3: Final Expression\n\nThe final task is to provide the analytic expression for $\\operatorname{area}(B)/|\\det A|$.\nFrom Task 1, we have $\\operatorname{area}(B) = 4b_1b_2$.\nThe determinant of the matrix $A=\\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\det A = ad - bc$.\nThe absolute value of the determinant is $|\\det A| = |ad - bc|$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{area}(B)}{|\\det A|} = \\frac{4b_1b_2}{|ad - bc|}\n$$\nThis is the simplified expression for the area of the set $S$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4b_{1}b_{2}}{|ad-bc|}}\n$$", "id": "3017941"}, {"introduction": "Having established the theoretical link between area and the determinant, we now apply this principle to a concrete example.

Therefore, $S$ is the preimage of $R$ under the transformation $T$:\n$$\nS = T^{-1}(R) = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : T(\\mathbf{x}) \\in R\\}.\n$$\nTo understand why $S$ is a parallelogram, we consider the boundary of $R$. The rectangle $R$ is bounded by four lines: $y_1 = 3$, $y_1 = -3$, $y_2 = 4$, and $y_2 = -4$. A fundamental property of an invertible linear transformation is that it maps lines to lines. Consequently, its inverse transformation, $T^{-1}$, also maps lines to lines. The boundary of $S$ is the preimage of the boundary of $R$.\nThe preimages of the boundary lines of $R$ are:\n1. The line $y_1 = 3$ is mapped from the line $L_1(\\mathbf{x}) = 4x_1 + x_2 = 3$ in the $\\mathbf{x}$-plane.\n2. The line $y_1 = -3$ is mapped from the line $L_1(\\mathbf{x}) = 4x_1 + x_2 = -3$ in the $\\mathbf{x}$-plane.\n3. The line $y_2 = 4$ is mapped from the line $L_2(\\mathbf{x}) = x_1 + 3x_2 = 4$ in the $\\mathbf{x}$-plane.\n4. The line $y_2 = -4$ is mapped from the line $L_2(\\mathbf{x}) = x_1 + 3x_2 = -4$ in the $\\mathbf{x}$-plane.\n\nThe region $S$ is therefore bounded by two pairs of parallel lines.

A quadrilateral enclosed by two pairs of parallel lines is, by definition, a parallelogram.

Their product is $c_1 c_2 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2$.\n\nComparing the product of the constants to the determinant's magnitude, we find $c_1 c_2 = 2 = \\Delta$. This demonstrates that the condition $\\prod c_i \\ge \\Delta$ is met with equality. Thus, the setup realizes the equality case of the condition in Minkowski's theorem for linear forms.\n\nTo connect this to the volume of the region $P$, we use the change of variables from $(m,n)$ to $(y_1, y_2)$. The region $P$ in the $(m,n)$-plane is defined by $|L_1(m,n)| \\le c_1$ and $|L_2(m,n)| \\le c_2$.

The inequalities become:\n$|k_1| \\le \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n$|k_2| \\le \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n\nFor an integer $k$, $|k| \\le \\sqrt{2}$ implies that $k$ can only be $-1$, $0$, or $1$. So, we must have $k_1, k_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nTo find the integer solutions $(m,n)$, we solve the system of equations for $m$ and $n$ in terms of $k_1$ and $k_2$:\n$m+n = k_1$\n$m-n = k_2$\nAdding the equations gives $2m = k_1+k_2$, so $m = \\frac{k_1+k_2}{2}$.\nSubtracting the second from the first gives $2n = k_1-k_2$, so $n = \\frac{k_1-k_2}{2}$.\n\nFor $m$ and $n$ to be integers, the sums $k_1+k_2$ and $k_1-k_2$ must both be even.

This is the zero vector, which we must exclude.\n\n2.  Both odd: The possibilities for $(y_1, y_2)$ where both components are in $\\{-1, 1\\}$ are:\n    - $(y_1,y_2) = (1,1)$: $m=\\frac{1+1}{2}=1$, $n=\\frac{1-1}{2}=0$.

Vector is $(-1,0)$.\n\nAll other pairs from $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}^2$, such as $(1,0)$, have components with different parity and thus do not correspond to integer vectors $(m,n)$.\n\nThe non-zero integer vectors $(m,n)$ satisfying the given inequalities are $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(0,-1)$, and $(-1,0)$. There are a total of $4$ such vectors.\n\nThe integer points are not on the boundary of the region $P$ because that would require $|m+n|=\\sqrt{2}$ or $|m-n|=\\sqrt{2}$, which is impossible for integers $m,n$. All four solution points lie strictly inside $P$. For example, for $(1,0)$, we have $|1+0|=1 < \\sqrt{2}$ and $|1-0|=1 < \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nIn summary, there are exactly four nonzero integer vectors that satisfy the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3017964"}]}
