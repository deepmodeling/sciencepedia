Let $\\Lambda$ be a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with lattice determinant $\\det(\\Lambda)$. Let $K$ be a convex, centrally symmetric subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If the volume of $K$, denoted $\\text{vol}(K)$, satisfies the inequality $\\text{vol}(K)  2^n \\det(\\Lambda)$, then $K$ must contain at least one point of $\\Lambda$ other than the origin $\\mathbf{0}$.\n\nWe will now formalize the components of the given problem in the context of this theorem.\n\n1.  **The Space and Lattice**: The problem is set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so the dimension is $n=3$. The lattice is the standard integer lattice $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^3$. The standard basis vectors for this lattice are $\\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$, $\\mathbf{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$, and $\\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)$. The lattice determinant $\\det(\\Lambda)$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix whose columns (or rows) are these basis vectors. This matrix is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix $I_3$. Therefore, the lattice determinant is $\\det(\\Lambda) = |\\det(I_3)| = 1$.\n\n2.  **The Convex Body**: The body is the cube $K_t = [-t, t]^3$.\n    -   **Convexity**: A cube is a convex set. It can be defined as the intersection of six half-spaces: $K_t = \\{ (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid -t \\le x_i \\le t \\text{ for } i=1,2,3 \\}$. Since each half-space is a convex set and the intersection of convex sets is convex, $K_t$ is convex.\n    -   **Central Symmetry**: A set $K$ is centrally symmetric if for every point $\\mathbf{x} \\in K$, the point $-\\mathbf{x}$ is also in $K$. If $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in K_t$, then $|x_i| \\le t$ for $i=1,2,3$. The point $-\\mathbf{x} = (-x_1, -x_2, -x_3)$ has coordinates satisfying $|-x_i| = |x_i| \\le t$. Thus, $-\\mathbf{x}$ is also in $K_t$. So, $K_t$ is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\n3.  **Volume of the Body**: The set $K_t$ is a cube with side length $2t$. Its volume is given by $\\text{vol}(K_t) = (2t)^3 = 8t^3$.\n\nNow, we apply the condition from Minkowski's theorem. The theorem guarantees that $K_t$ contains a nonzero point of $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ if the following strict inequality holds:\n$$ \\text{vol}(K_t)  2^n \\det(\\Lambda) $$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$$ 8t^3  2^3 \\cdot 1 $$\n$$ 8t^3  8 $$\nDividing both sides by $8$ (which is a positive constant) preserves the inequality:\n$$ t^3  1 $$\nSince the problem specifies $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$, we can take the cube root of both sides, which is a strictly increasing function, thus preserving the inequality:\n$$ t  1 $$\nThis result indicates that Minkowski's theorem provides the guarantee of a nonzero lattice point for all values of $t$ in the interval $(1, \\infty)$. The problem asks for the infimum threshold $t_0$ such that the guarantee holds for all $t  t_0$. The set of such $t$ is $(1, \\infty)$, and the infimum of this set is $1$. Therefore, the threshold is $t_0 = 1$.\n\nFor $t=t_0=1$, the condition of the theorem becomes $\\text{vol}(K_1) = 8 = 2^3 \\det(\\Lambda)$. The strict inequality is not satisfied, and thus the theorem itself does not provide a guarantee in this boundary case. The question specifically asks for the threshold for the *guarantee* from the theorem, which is precisely at the boundary where the inequality becomes strict.\n\nFinally, as requested, we conclude the existence of a nonzero lattice point in $K_t$ whenever $t  t_0$.\nLet $t_0 = 1$. For any given $t  t_0$, it follows that $t  1$. As $t$ is positive, we can cube both sides to obtain $t^3  1$. Multiplying by $8$ gives $8t^3  8$.\nThe volume of the set $K_t$ is $\\text{vol}(K_t) = (2t)^3 = 8t^3$.\nThe condition for Minkowski's theorem requires comparing this volume to $2^n \\det(\\Lambda)$, which for $n=3$ and $\\Lambda=\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is $2^3 \\cdot 1 = 8$.\nSince $t1$, we have established that $\\text{vol}(K_t) = 8t^3  8$.\nThus, the condition $\\text{vol}(K_t)  2^n \\det(\\Lambda)$ is satisfied.\nTherefore, by direct application of Minkowski's convex body theorem, for any $t  1$, the cube $K_t$ is guaranteed to contain at least one point of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ other than the origin.\nThe infimum threshold for this guarantee is $t_0 = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3017816"}, {"introduction": "Applications of the theorem often involve lattices that are not the standard integer lattice.

Computation of the exact volume $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)$.\nWe compute this volume using two different methods to ensure correctness.\n\nMethod A: Using the volume scaling property.\nThe problem states that the Lebesgue volume scales by $|\\det(A)|$ under a linear map $A$, so $\\operatorname{vol}(AK) = |\\det(A)| \\operatorname{vol}(K)$. First, we compute the volume of the original ellipsoid $K$. The semi-axes of $K$ are given by the denominators in its defining inequality: $r_1 = 1/3$, $r_2 = 2$, and $r_3 = 1/2$. The volume of a $3D$ ellipsoid with semi-axes $r_1, r_2, r_3$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_1 r_2 r_3$.\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(K) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(2)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{9}\\pi $$\nThe determinant of the map $A = \\operatorname{diag}(3,1,2)$ is $\\det(A) = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 6$. So, $|\\det(A)| = 6$.\nTherefore, the volume of the transformed body is:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(AK) = |\\det(A)| \\operatorname{vol}(K) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9}\\pi = \\frac{24}{9}\\pi = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi $$\n\nMethod B: Direct computation from the description of $AK$.\nThe inequality for $AK$ is $y_1^2 + (\\frac{y_2}{2})^2 + y_3^2 \\leq 1$. This can be written as:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{y_1}{1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y_2}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y_3}{1}\\right)^2 \\leq 1 $$\nThis is an ellipsoid with semi-axes $r'_1 = 1$, $r'_2 = 2$, and $r'_3 = 1$. Its volume is:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(AK) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r'_1 r'_2 r'_3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (1)(2)(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi $$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.\n\n3. Computation of $\\det(A\\Lambda)$ and verification of the Minkowski volume inequality.\nThe lattice is given as $\\Lambda = A^{-1}\\mathbb{Z}^3$. We are asked to compute the determinant of the transformed lattice $A\\Lambda$. Applying the transformation $A$ to $\\Lambda$:\n$$ A\\Lambda = A(A^{-1}\\mathbb{Z}^3) = (AA^{-1})\\mathbb{Z}^3 = I\\mathbb{Z}^3 = \\mathbb{Z}^3 $$\nThe transformed lattice is the standard integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$. The determinant of a lattice $\\Gamma = B\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is $|\\det(B)|$. For $\\mathbb{Z}^3$, the matrix $B$ is the identity matrix $I$, so its determinant is $|\\det(I)| = 1$. Thus, $\\det(A\\Lambda) = \\det(\\mathbb{Z}^3) = 1$.\nNow we must verify the inequality $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)  2^3 \\det(A\\Lambda)$. We have $\\operatorname{vol}(AK) = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi$ and $2^3 \\det(A\\Lambda) = 8 \\cdot 1 = 8$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{8}{3}\\pi  8$, which simplifies to $\\pi  3$. This is a known mathematical fact. Thus, the inequality is verified.\n\n4. Conclusion based on Minkowski's theorem and exhibition of a nonzero integer point.\nMinkowski's convex body theorem states that for a lattice $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and an origin-symmetric convex set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, if $\\operatorname{vol}(S)  2^n \\det(\\Gamma)$, then $S$ contains at least one non-zero point of $\\Gamma$.\nThe problem of finding a non-zero point $x \\in \\Lambda \\cap K$ is equivalent to finding a non-zero integer point $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$ in the transformed set $AK$, where $y = Ax$. We apply Minkowski's theorem to the lattice $\\Gamma = A\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^3$ and the set $S = AK$ with $n=3$.\n- $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- $AK$ is a convex set because $K$ is convex and $A$ is a linear map.\n- $AK$ is origin-symmetric because $K$ is origin-symmetric ($x \\in K \\implies -x \\in K$), which implies $y=Ax \\in AK \\implies -y = A(-x) \\in AK$.\n- We have shown in part 3 that $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)  2^3 \\det(\\mathbb{Z}^3)$.\nAll conditions of the theorem are satisfied. Therefore, there exists a non-zero point $y \\in AK \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\nTo exhibit one such point, we must find a non-zero integer vector $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3)$ that satisfies the inequality for $AK$:\n$$ y_1^2 + \\left(\\frac{y_2}{2}\\right)^2 + y_3^2 \\leq 1 $$\nConsider the point $y = (0, 1, 0)$. It is a non-zero integer vector. Substituting its components into the inequality gives:\n$$ 0^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nSince $\\frac{1}{4} \\leq 1$, the point $y = (0, 1, 0)$ is in $AK$. Another simple example is $y=(1,0,0)$, which gives $1^2+0^2+0^2=1 \\leq 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact value of $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)$ as the final answer.
