We need to find the set of $n \\pmod{25}$ for which this is not possible.\n\nLet $S_{k}$ be the set of $k$-th powers of units modulo $p^{\\nu}$. For our problem, $k=2$ and $p^{\\nu}=25$, so we are interested in the set of quadratic residues in $(\\mathbb{Z}/25\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, which we denote as $S_{2}$:\n$$S_{2} = \\{ a^{2} \\pmod{25} \\mid a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/25\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\}$$\nThe problem states that for an odd prime $p$, an element $u \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^{\\nu}\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a square if and only if its reduction modulo $p$ is a square.\nFirst, we find the quadratic residues in $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n$1^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n$2^{2} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$3^{2} = 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$4^{2} = 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\nThe set of quadratic residues in $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $\\{1, 4\\}$.\n\nUsing the provided fact, an element $u \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/25\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a square if and only if $u \\pmod{5}$ is a square, i.e., $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ or $u \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.

We are looking for the residue classes $n$ *not* in this sumset.\n\nLet's analyze the sums modulo $5$. Let $s_{1}, s_{2} \\in S_{2}$.

So we must check if the set $S_{2,1}+S_{2,1}$ covers all $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n    Let $s_{1} = 1+5j_{1}$ and $s_{2} = 1+5j_{2}$ with $j_{1}, j_{2} \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$.\n    $s_{1}+s_{2} = 2+5(j_{1}+j_{2})$. Since $\\{j_{1}+j_{2} \\pmod{5} \\mid j_{1},j_{2} \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}\\} = \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ (as $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is a group), the term $5(j_{1}+j_{2})$ generates all multiples of $5$ modulo $25$, i.e., $\\{0, 5, 10, 15, 20\\}$.\n    So, $S_{2,1}+S_{2,1} = \\{2+0, 2+5, 2+10, 2+15, 2+20\\} = \\{2, 7, 12, 17, 22\\}$. This is precisely the set of all residue classes modulo $25$ that are congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, all such $n$ have solutions.\n\n2.  Case $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$: A sum $s_{1}+s_{2}$ is congruent to $3 \\pmod{5}$ only if $s_{1} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ and $s_{2} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. We check the sumset $S_{2,4}+S_{2,4}$.\n    Let $s_{1} = 4+5j_{1}$ and $s_{2} = 4+5j_{2}$.\n    $s_{1}+s_{2} = 8+5(j_{1}+j_{2})$. Again, $5(j_{1}+j_{2})$ covers $\\{0, 5, 10, 15, 20\\}$.\n    So, $S_{2,4}+S_{2,4} = \\{8, 13, 18, 23, 28\\equiv3\\} = \\{3, 8, 13, 18, 23\\}$. This is the set of all residue classes modulo $25$ congruent to $3 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, all such $n$ have solutions.\n\n3.  Case $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$: A sum $s_{1}+s_{2}$ is congruent to $0 \\pmod{5}$ only if one is congruent to $1 \\pmod{5}$ and the other to $4 \\pmod{5}$. We check the sumset $S_{2,1}+S_{2,4}$.\n    Let $s_{1} = 1+5j_{1}$ and $s_{2} = 4+5j_{2}$.\n    $s_{1}+s_{2} = 5+5(j_{1}+j_{2})$.\n    So, $S_{2,1}+S_{2,4} = \\{5, 10, 15, 20, 25\\equiv0\\} = \\{0, 5, 10, 15, 20\\}$. This is the set of all residue classes modulo $25$ congruent to $0 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, all such $n$ have solutions.\n\nWe have demonstrated that a solution exists if and only if $n \\pmod{5} \\notin \\{1, 4\\}$.\nThe subset of residue classes modulo $25$ that fail local solvability is the set of $n$ for which $\\sigma_{5}^{\\mathcal{P}}(n)=0$.

To show that $N_{k,s}(r) > 0$, we need to bound $|E(r)|$ and show that it is smaller than the main term $p^{s-1}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the error term can be bounded using the triangle inequality:\n$$\n|E(r)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} S(a,k)^s e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i a r}{p}} \\right| \\le \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} |S(a,k)|^s.\n$$\nFor $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, p-1\\}$, the sum $S(a,k)$ is a complete exponential sum.

This gives us a condition that is independent of the specific prime $p$:\n$$\np^{s/2} > \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)(k-1)^s.\n$$\nFor large $p$, the term $(1 - 1/p)$ approaches $1$. The condition is essentially $p^{s/2} > (k-1)^s$.\nSince $k \\geq 2$ and $s \\geq 2$ are fixed constants, the right side, $(k-1)^s$, is a fixed constant (or $0$ if $k=2$, in which case the inequality holds for $p > 0$). The left side, $p^{s/2}$, grows with $p$ because $s \\ge 2$ implies $s/2 \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, there must exist a prime $p_0$ (which depends on $k$ and $s$) such that for all primes $p > p_0$, the inequality $p^{s/2} > (1 - 1/p)(k-1)^s$ holds. For example, any $p > (k-1)^{2s/s} = (k-1)^2$ will satisfy $p^{s/2} > (k-1)^s$, and for a slightly larger threshold, the full inequality will hold.\n\nFor any $p > p_0(k,s)$, we have $N_{k,s}(r) > 0$ for all $r \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$.

The formula is of the form $R_{s,k}(N) \\sim \\mathfrak{S}_{s,k}(N) \\cdot J(N)$, where $\\mathfrak{S}_{s,k}(N)$ is the \"singular series\" and $J(N)$ is the \"singular integral\". The singular series is a product over all primes $p$:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{S}_{s,k}(N) = \\prod_p \\chi_p(N),\n$$\nwhere each factor $\\chi_p(N)$ represents the $p$-adic density of solutions. Specifically, $\\chi_p(N) = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} p^{m(1-s)} M(N, p^m)$, where $M(N, q)$ is the number of solutions to $\\sum_{i=1}^s x_i^k \\equiv N \\pmod q$. A necessary condition for $R_{s,k}(N)>0$ for large $N$ is that $\\mathfrak{S}_{s,k}(N) > 0$, which requires $\\chi_p(N) > 0$ for all primes $p$. The positivity of $\\chi_p(N)$ depends on the solubility of the congruence $\\sum x_i^k \\equiv N \\pmod{p^m}$ for all $m \\ge 1$. By Hensel's lemma, solubility for all powers of $p$ is often guaranteed by solubility modulo $p$ (with some non-singularity conditions on the solutions). Our result that $\\mathcal{R}_{k,s}(p) = \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ for large primes $p$ means that for any integer $N$, the congruence $\\sum x_i^k \\equiv N \\pmod p$ is soluble for $p > p_0(k,s)$. This ensures that the corresponding factors $\\chi_p(N)$ in the singular series are positive for all large primes $p$, removing any potential \"local obstruction\" to having integer solutions from these primes.\n\n**Connection to Goldbach's Conjecture:** The binary Goldbach conjecture states every even integer $N > 2$ is a sum of two primes. A similar circle method heuristic suggests the number of representations is governed by a singular series $\\mathfrak{S}(N)$. The existence of solutions in integers relies on the absence of local obstructions. The local problem for Goldbach modulo a prime $p$ is whether any residue class $r \\pmod p$ can be written as a sum of two residues that are coprime to $p$. Let $A = (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. We are asking if $A+A = \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$. For $p > 2$, $|A| = p-1$. By the Cauchy-Davenport theorem, $|A+A| \\ge \\min(p, 2|A|-1) = \\min(p, 2(p-1)-1) = \\min(p, 2p-3) = p$. For $p=2$, the only residue coprime to $2$ is $1$, and $1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, so even numbers are sums of two odd numbers. Thus, for any prime $p$, there is no local obstruction to the Goldbach conjecture. Our calculation for $\\pi_{k,s}(p)$ is a more complex instance of the same principle: verifying local solubility modulo primes as a prerequisite for global (integer) solubility. It demonstrates that sumsets of well-distributed sets, like $k$-th powers, tend to cover the entire residue ring for large primes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3007962"}, {"introduction": "Having established the necessary local conditions for solvability, we turn to the \"global\" problem of finding integer solutions and the power of the circle method's analytic machinery.

The singular series $\\mathfrak{S}_4(n)$ is bounded below by a positive constant $c > 0$ for almost all integers (those satisfying certain local conditions), and the constant $C_{s,4}$ is positive. Therefore,\n$$\n|M_{s,4}(n)| \\asymp n^{s/4 - 1} \\asymp X^{s/4 - 1}.\n$$\nUsing the relation $P = X^{1/4}$, we have $X=P^4$. Substituting this into the estimate gives\n$$\n|M_{s,4}(n)| \\asymp (P^4)^{s/4 - 1} = P^{s - 4}.\n$$\nFor $n \\in E_{s,4}(X)$, the minor arc contribution is thus bounded below:\n$$\n|m_{s,4}(n)| \\gg P^{s-4}.\n$$\nSquaring and summing over all $n$ in the exceptional set $E_{s,4}(X)$ provides a lower bound for the sum of squares:\n$$\n\\sum_{n \\in E_{s,4}(X)} |m_{s,4}(n)|^2 \\gg \\sum_{n \\in E_{s,4}(X)} (P^{s-4})^2 = |E_{s,4}(X)| P^{2s-8}.\n$$\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound for the same sum. The minor arc contribution $m_{s,4}(n)$ is the Fourier coefficient of the function $f(\\alpha)^s$ restricted to the minor arcs $\\mathfrak{m}$. Let $g(\\alpha) = f(\\alpha)^s \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathfrak{m}}(\\alpha)$, where $\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ is the indicator function of the minor arcs. The $n$-th Fourier coefficient of $g(\\alpha)$ is precisely $m_{s,4}(n)$. By Parseval's identity (or Bessel's inequality), the sum of the squares of the Fourier coefficients is bounded by the integral of the square of the function's modulus:\n$$\n\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |m_{s,4}(n)|^2 = \\int_0^1 |g(\\alpha)|^2 d\\alpha = \\int_{\\mathfrak{m}} |f(\\alpha)|^{2s} d\\alpha.\n$$\nThe sum over the exceptional set is bounded by the sum over all integers:\n$$\n\\sum_{n \\in E_{s,4}(X)} |m_{s,4}(n)|^2 \\le \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |m_{s,4}(n)|^2 \\le \\int_{\\mathfrak{m}} |f(\\alpha)|^{2s} d\\alpha.\n$$\nTo bound the integral over the minor arcs, we can use the trivial but correct inequality that it is less than or equal to the integral over the entire interval $[0, 1]$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathfrak{m}} |f(\\alpha)|^{2s} d\\alpha \\le \\int_0^1 |f(\\alpha)|^{2s} d\\alpha.\n$$\nThe problem statement provides the bound for this integral from the sharp form of the VMVT. For $s \\geq 10$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 |f(\\alpha)|^{2s} d\\alpha \\ll P^{2s - 10 + \\varepsilon}.\n$$\nThus, we have the upper bound for the second moment sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{n \\in E_{s,4}(X)} |m_{s,4}(n)|^2 \\ll P^{2s - 10 + \\varepsilon}.\n$$\n\nNow we combine the lower and upper bounds:\n$$\n|E_{s,4}(X)| P^{2s-8} \\ll P^{2s - 10 + \\varepsilon}.\n$$\nSolving for $|E_{s,4}(X)|$:\n$$\n|E_{s,4}(X)| \\ll \\frac{P^{2s-10+\\varepsilon}}{P^{2s-8}} = P^{-2+\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nThe final step is to express this bound in terms of $X$. With $P=X^{1/4}$, we have:\n$$\n|E_{s,4}(X)| \\ll (X^{1/4})^{-2+\\varepsilon} = X^{-1/2 + \\varepsilon/4}.\n$$\nLetting $\\varepsilon'$ be an arbitrary positive real number (e.g., $\\varepsilon/4$), the bound is\n$$\n|E_{s,4}(X)| \\ll X^{-1/2 + \\varepsilon'}.\n$$\nWe are asked to find an exponent $\\delta > 0$ such that $|E_{s,4}(X)| \\ll X^{1-\\delta+\\varepsilon'}$.\nComparing the exponents, we have:\n$$\n1 - \\delta = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta$ yields:\n$$\n\\delta = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n$$\nThis value of $\\delta$ is positive and has been derived using only the information and methods specified in the problem statement. This exponent holds for all integers $s \\geq 10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "3007971"}]}
