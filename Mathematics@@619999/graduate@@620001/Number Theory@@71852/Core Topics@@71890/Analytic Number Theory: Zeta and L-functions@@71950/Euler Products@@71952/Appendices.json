It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nLet the given Dirichlet series be $F(s) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\tau(n) n^{-s}$, where $\\tau(n)$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$, and $s$ is a complex number with $\\Re(s) > 1$. The problem requires us to derive the Euler product for $F(s)$ and determine the coefficients of its local factors.\n\nOur derivation will proceed from the fundamental properties provided. A key property of the divisor function $\\tau(n)$ is its representation as a Dirichlet convolution. The Dirichlet convolution of two arithmetic functions $f$ and $g$ is defined by $(f*g)(n) = \\sum_{d|n} f(d)g(n/d)$, where the sum is over the positive divisors of $n$. The divisor function $\\tau(n) = \\sum_{d|n} 1$. Let $\\mathbf{1}(n)$ be the arithmetic function that is equal to $1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then, $\\tau(n)$ can be expressed as the convolution of $\\mathbf{1}$ with itself:\n$$\\tau(n) = (\\mathbf{1} * \\mathbf{1})(n) = \\sum_{d|n} \\mathbf{1}(d)\\mathbf{1}(n/d)$$\nA fundamental property connecting Dirichlet series and convolutions states that for two arithmetic functions $f$ and $g$, the Dirichlet series of their convolution, $D_{f*g}(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (f*g)(n) n^{-s}$, is the product of their individual Dirichlet series, $D_f(s) D_g(s)$, provided that $D_f(s)$ and $D_g(s)$ converge absolutely.\n\nThe Dirichlet series for the function $\\mathbf{1}(n)$ is the Riemann zeta function:\n$$\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}(n) n^{-s} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-s}$$\nThis series is known to converge absolutely for $\\Re(s) > 1$. Since the series for $F(s)$ is also specified to converge absolutely in this domain, we can apply the convolution property. The Dirichlet series for $\\tau = \\mathbf{1} * \\mathbf{1}$ is therefore:\n$$F(s) = D_{\\tau}(s) = D_{\\mathbf{1}*\\mathbf{1}}(s) = D_{\\mathbf{1}}(s) \\cdot D_{\\mathbf{1}}(s) = (\\zeta(s))^2$$\n\nThe Riemann zeta function has a well-known Euler product representation, which is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (the unique prime factorization of integers). For $\\Re(s) > 1$, this factorization is:\n$$\\zeta(s) = \\prod_{p} \\left( 1 - p^{-s} \\right)^{-1}$$\nwhere the product is over all prime numbers $p$.\n\nBy squaring this expression, we obtain the Euler product factorization for $F(s)$:\n$$F(s) = (\\zeta(s))^2 = \\left( \\prod_{p} \\left( 1 - p^{-s} \\right)^{-1} \\right)^2 = \\prod_{p} \\left( 1 - p^{-s} \\right)^{-2}$$\nThis proves that $F(s)$ admits an Euler product factorization. The product is taken over all primes $p$, and the local factor at a fixed prime $p$ is $\\left( 1 - p^{-s} \\right)^{-2}$. This expression is the required closed-form rational function of $p^{-s}$.\n\nThe problem then asks to find the coefficients $a_{p^k}$ in the series representation of this local factor, which is denoted as $\\sum_{k \\ge 0} a_{p^{k}} p^{-k s}$. To do this, we expand the local factor $\\left( 1 - p^{-s} \\right)^{-2}$ into a power series. Let $x = p^{-s}$. We need to find the series expansion of $(1-x)^{-2}$. We can use the generalized binomial theorem, which states that $(1+z)^\\alpha = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{\\alpha}{k} z^k$ for $|z|<1$.\nSetting $z = -x$ and $\\alpha = -2$, we get:\n$$(1-x)^{-2} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{-2}{k} (-x)^k$$\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{-2}{k}$ is calculated as:\n$$\\binom{-2}{k} = \\frac{(-2)(-3)\\cdots(-2-k+1)}{k!} = \\frac{(-1)^k (2)(3)\\cdots(k+1)}{k!} = \\frac{(-1)^k (k+1)!}{k!} = (-1)^k(k+1)$$\nSubstituting this back into the series expansion:\n$$(1-x)^{-2} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k(k+1) (-x)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k(k+1) (-1)^k x^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (k+1) x^k$$\nThis series converges for $|x|<1$. In our case, $|x| = |p^{-s}| = |p^{-\\Re(s) - i\\Im(s)}| = p^{-\\Re(s)}$. Since $\\Re(s)>1$ and $p \\ge 2$, we have $p^{-\\Re(s)} < 1$, so the expansion is valid.\n\nReplacing $x$ with $p^{-s}$, the local factor is:\n$$\\left( 1 - p^{-s} \\right)^{-2} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (k+1) (p^{-s})^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (k+1) p^{-ks}$$\nThe problem defines the local factor's series as $\\sum_{k \\ge 0} a_{p^{k}} p^{-k s}$. By comparing the two forms, we can directly identify the coefficients:\n$$a_{p^k} = k+1$$\nThis is the closed formula for the coefficients $a_{p^k}$ as a function of $k$.\n\nAlternatively, the general theory of Euler products for multiplicative functions states that for a multiplicative function $f$, its Dirichlet series is given by $\\sum_{n \\ge 1} f(n) n^{-s} = \\prod_p \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty f(p^k) p^{-ks}$. Since $\\tau(n)$ is a multiplicative function, the coefficients $a_{p^k}$ in our problem are simply $a_{p^k} = \\tau(p^k)$. The positive divisors of a prime power $p^k$ are $p^0, p^1, p^2, \\dots, p^k$. There are $k+1$ such divisors. Therefore, $\\tau(p^k) = k+1$.
