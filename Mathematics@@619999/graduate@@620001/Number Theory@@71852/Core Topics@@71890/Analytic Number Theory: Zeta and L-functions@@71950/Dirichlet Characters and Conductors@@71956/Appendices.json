This group consists of the residue classes $[a]$ modulo $8$ such that $\\gcd(a, 8) = 1$. The integers between $1$ and $7$ that are coprime to $8$ are $1, 3, 5, 7$. Thus,\n$$ (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} = \\{[1], [3], [5], [7]\\} $$\nThe order of this group is $|(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}| = 4$. To determine its structure, we find the order of each element:\n- $[1]^1 = [1]$ (order $1$)\n- $[3]^2 = [9] = [1]$ (order $2$)\n- $[5]^2 = [25] = [1]$ (order $2$)\n- $[7]^2 = [49] = [1]$ (order $2$)\nSince all non-identity elements have order $2$, the group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nA set of generators for this group can be formed by any two distinct elements of order $2$. Let's choose the set $\\{[3], [5]\\}$. We can verify they generate the group: $[3]^1[5]^0=[3]$, $[3]^0[5]^1=[5]$, $[3]^1[5]^1=[15]=[7]$, and $[3]^0[5]^0=[1]$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $8$ is a group homomorphism from $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ to the multiplicative group of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$. The value of $\\chi$ on any element is determined by its values on the generators. Since $[3]^2=[1]$ and $[5]^2=[1]$, we must have $\\chi(3)^2 = \\chi(1) = 1$ and $\\chi(5)^2 = \\chi(1) = 1$. This implies that $\\chi(3)$ and $\\chi(5)$ must be either $1$ or $-1$. There are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible combinations, each defining a unique character. We denote these characters by $\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4$. We extend them to all integers $n$ by setting $\\chi(n)=0$ if $\\gcd(n,8) \\neq 1$.\n\nThe four Dirichlet characters modulo $8$ are specified as follows:\n1.  **$\\chi_1$ (The principal character):** Defined by $\\chi_1(3)=1$ and $\\chi_1(5)=1$.\n    The values on $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ are: $\\chi_1(1)=1$, $\\chi_1(3)=1$, $\\chi_1(5)=1$, $\\chi_1(7)=\\chi_1(3)\\chi_1(5)=1$.\n\n2.  **$\\chi_2$:** Defined by $\\chi_2(3)=-1$ and $\\chi_2(5)=1$.\n    The values on $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ are: $\\chi_2(1)=1$, $\\chi_2(3)=-1$, $\\chi_2(5)=1$, $\\chi_2(7)=\\chi_2(3)\\chi_2(5)=-1$.\n\n3.  **$\\chi_3$:** Defined by $\\chi_3(3)=1$ and $\\chi_3(5)=-1$.\n    The values on $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ are: $\\chi_3(1)=1$, $\\chi_3(3)=1$, $\\chi_3(5)=-1$, $\\chi_3(7)=\\chi_3(3)\\chi_3(5)=-1$.\n\n4.  **$\\chi_4$:** Defined by $\\chi_4(3)=-1$ and $\\chi_4(5)=-1$.\n    The values on $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ are: $\\chi_4(1)=1$, $\\chi_4(3)=-1$, $\\chi_4(5)=-1$, $\\chi_4(7)=\\chi_4(3)\\chi_4(5)=1$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Conductors**\n\nThe conductor of a character $\\chi$ modulo $m$ is the smallest positive integer $f$ dividing $m$ such that $\\chi$ is induced by a primitive character modulo $f$. For our purposes, we find the smallest divisor $f$ of $8$ (i.e., $f \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 8\\}$) such that $\\chi$ is well-defined as a character modulo $f$. This means that for any integers $a, b$ with $\\gcd(a, 8)=\\gcd(b, 8)=1$, $a \\equiv b \\pmod{f}$ implies $\\chi(a) = \\chi(b)$.\n\n-   **Conductor of $\\chi_1$**: $\\chi_1(n)=1$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n, 8)=1$. This character can be induced from the trivial character modulo $1$, which is primitive. Thus, the conductor is $f=1$.\n\n-   **Conductor of $\\chi_2$**: The values on $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ are $\\{1, -1, 1, -1\\}$.\n    -   Is it a character modulo $4$? We check pairs of elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ that are congruent modulo $4$.\n        -   $1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 4$. We must have $\\chi_2(1)=\\chi_2(5)$. We have $1=1$, which is true.\n        -   $3 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 4$. We must have $\\chi_2(3)=\\chi_2(7)$. We have $-1=-1$, which is true.\n        Since the conditions hold, $\\chi_2$ is a character modulo $4$.\n    -   Is it a character modulo $2$? All odd numbers are congruent to $1$ modulo $2$. This would require $\\chi_2(1)=\\chi_2(3)=\\chi_2(5)=\\chi_2(7)$, which is not true ($1\\neq -1$).\n    So, $\\chi_2$ is induced by a character $\\psi$ modulo $4$, given by $\\psi(1)=1$ and $\\psi(3)=-1$. This character $\\psi$ is primitive modulo $4$ (as it is not induced from a lower modulus). Therefore, the conductor of $\\chi_2$ is $f=4$.\n\n-   **Conductor of $\\chi_3$**: The values on $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ are $\\{1, 1, -1, -1\\}$.\n    -   Is it a character modulo $4$? We check $1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 4$. We must have $\\chi_3(1)=\\chi_3(5)$. We have $1 \\neq -1$, so this fails.\n    -   Since $\\chi_3$ is not a character modulo $4$, it cannot be induced from any character on a modulus smaller than $8$ that divides $8$. Thus, $\\chi_3$ must be a primitive character modulo $8$. Its conductor is $f=8$.\n\n-   **Conductor of $\\chi_4$**: The values on $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ are $\\{1, -1, -1, 1\\}$.\n    -   Is it a character modulo $4$? We check $1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 4$. We must have $\\chi_4(1)=\\chi_4(5)$. We have $1 \\neq -1$, so this fails.\n    -   Like $\\chi_3$, $\\chi_4$ is not a character modulo $4$. It is a primitive character modulo $8$. Its conductor is $f=8$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $\\det(T)$**\n\nWe form the $4 \\times 4$ character table matrix $T$ where $T_{ij} = \\chi_i(a_j)$. We fix the order of characters as $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ and the order of elements as $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = (1, 3, 5, 7)$.\n\nThe matrix $T$ is:\n$$ T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\chi_1(1) & \\chi_1(3) & \\chi_1(5) & \\chi_1(7) \\\\\n\\chi_2(1) & \\chi_2(3) & \\chi_2(5) & \\chi_2(7) \\\\\n\\chi_3(1) & \\chi_3(3) & \\chi_3(5) & \\chi_3(7) \\\\\n\\chi_4(1) & \\chi_4(3) & \\chi_4(5) & \\chi_4(7)\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & -1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo compute the determinant of $T$, we can use row operations. Let $R_i$ denote the $i$-th row.\n$R_2 \\to R_2 - R_1$\n$R_3 \\to R_3 - R_1$\n$R_4 \\to R_4 - R_1$\n$$ \\det(T) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 0 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -2 & -2 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nExpanding along the first column:\n$$ \\det(T) = 1 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & 0 & -2 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -2 \\\\\n-2 & -2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we compute the $3 \\times 3$ determinant:\n$$ \\det(T) = (-2) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -2 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - (0) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + (-2) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ -2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(T) = (-2)( (-2)(0) - (-2)(-2) ) - (2)( (0)(-2) - (-2)(-2) ) $$\n$$ \\det(T) = (-2)(0 - 4) - 2(0 - 4) $$\n$$ \\det(T) = (-2)(-4) - 2(-4) = 8 + 8 = 16 $$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the orthogonality relations for characters. The rows of the character table of a finite abelian group are orthogonal. Since the character values are real, $T T^T = |G| I$, where $|G| = 4$ is the order of the group and $I$ is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix.\n$$ T T^T = 4I_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTaking the determinant of both sides:\n$$ \\det(T T^T) = \\det(T) \\det(T^T) = (\\det(T))^2 $$\n$$ \\det(4I_4) = 4^4 = 256 $$\nSo, $(\\det(T))^2 = 256$, which implies $\\det(T) = \\pm 16$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is determined in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: The minimal cyclotomic field containing the values of $\\chi$**\n\nThe values of the character $\\chi$ are the elements in its image, $\\text{Im}(\\chi)$. From the problem statement, for any integer $n$, $\\chi(n)$ can be $0$ (if $\\gcd(n,12)\\neq 1$) or one of the values taken on $(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The values on this group are specified as $1$ and $-1$.\nThus, the set of all values of $\\chi$ is $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\nWe seek the minimal cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ that contains this set of values. The field must contain the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ to include $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. A cyclotomic field is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$, where $\\zeta_m = \\exp(2\\pi i / m)$ is a primitive $m$-th root of unity. We need to find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $\\{0, 1, -1\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$.\nSince all values are rational, the smallest field containing them is $\\mathbb{Q}$ itself. We must find the smallest positive integer $m$ for which $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe degree of the field extension $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m) : \\mathbb{Q}]$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(m)$. For $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ to be equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$, the degree of the extension must be $1$. We need to find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $\\phi(m)=1$.\nThe only positive integers $m$ for which $\\phi(m)=1$ are $m=1$ and $m=2$.\nThe smallest of these is $m=1$.\nTherefore, the minimal cyclotomic field containing the values of $\\chi$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_1) = \\mathbb{Q}(1) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Part 2: The conductor $f_{\\chi}$ of $\\chi$**\n\nThe conductor $f_{\\chi}$ of a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is the modulus of the unique primitive character $\\chi'$ that induces $\\chi$. That is, $\\chi(n) = \\chi'(n)$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n, N)=1$, and $f_{\\chi}$ is the modulus of $\\chi'$. A character is primitive if it is not induced by any character of a strictly smaller modulus.\n\nWe are given $\\chi$ as a character modulo $N=12$. We can decompose $\\chi$ using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which gives a ring isomorphism $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and a group isomorphism $(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.\nAny character $\\chi$ on $(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\psi_3\\psi_4$, where $\\psi_3$ is a character of $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ and $\\psi_4$ is a character of $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, extended to $(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.\n\nThe CRT mapping from $n \\pmod{12}$ to $(n \\pmod 3, n \\pmod 4)$ is:\n- $1 \\mapsto (1, 1)$\n- $5 \\mapsto (2, 1)$\n- $7 \\mapsto (1, 3)$\n- $11 \\mapsto (2, 3)$\n\nThe characters satisfy $\\chi(n) = \\psi_3(n \\pmod 3) \\psi_4(n \\pmod 4)$. Using the given values of $\\chi$:\n- For $n=5$: $\\chi(5) = -1$. This gives $\\psi_3(2)\\psi_4(1) = -1$. Since $\\psi_4(1)=1$, we have $\\psi_3(2)=-1$. This specifies $\\psi_3$ as the unique non-trivial character modulo $3$.\n- For $n=7$: $\\chi(7) = -1$. This gives $\\psi_3(1)\\psi_4(3) = -1$. Since $\\psi_3(1)=1$, we have $\\psi_4(3)=-1$. This specifies $\\psi_4$ as the unique non-trivial character modulo $4$.\n\nLet's verify with $n=11$: $\\chi(11) = \\psi_3(2)\\psi_4(3) = (-1)(-1) = 1$, which matches the given value.\n\nSo, $\\chi$ decomposes into $\\psi_3$ and $\\psi_4$.\n- $\\psi_3$ is the character on $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ defined by $\\psi_3(1)=1, \\psi_3(2)=-1$. The only proper divisor of the modulus $3$ is $1$. A character modulo $1$ must be trivial. Since $\\psi_3$ is non-trivial, it cannot be induced from a character modulo $1$. Thus, $\\psi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $3$, and its conductor is $f_{\\psi_3}=3$.\n- $\\psi_4$ is the character on $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ defined by $\\psi_4(1)=1, \\psi_4(3)=-1$. The proper divisors of the modulus $4$ are $1$ and $2$. As it is non-trivial, it is not induced from modulus $1$. A character modulo $2$ is defined on $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times=\\{1\\}$, so it must be trivial. To be induced from a character modulo $2$, $\\psi_4(n)$ would have to be $1$ for all $n \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ that are $1 \\pmod 2$. Both $1$ and $3$ are $1 \\pmod 2$, but $\\psi_4(3)=-1\\neq 1$. So $\\psi_4$ is not induced from a character modulo $2$. Thus, $\\psi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $4$, and its conductor is $f_{\\psi_4}=4$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ given modulo $12$ corresponds to the product of primitive characters $\\psi_3$ (mod $3$) and $\\psi_4$ (mod $4$). According to the theory of Dirichlet characters, if $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ are primitive characters with coprime moduli $m_1$ and $m_2$, their product $\\chi_1\\chi_2$ is a primitive character with modulus $m_1m_2$.\nIn our case, $\\psi_3$ is primitive mod $3$ and $\\psi_4$ is primitive mod $4$. Since $\\gcd(3,4)=1$, their product defines a primitive character modulo $3 \\times 4 = 12$. The character $\\chi$ is precisely this primitive character.\n\nSince $\\chi$ is itself a primitive character modulo $12$, it is induced from itself, and no smaller modulus is possible. By definition, the conductor of a primitive character is its modulus.\nTherefore, the conductor of $\\chi$ is $f_{\\chi}=12$.\n\nWe can verify this conclusion directly. For $\\chi$ (mod $12$) to be induced from a character of a proper divisor $d$ of $12$ (i.e. $d \\in \\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$), we must have $\\chi(a)=\\chi(b)$ whenever $a \\equiv b \\pmod d$ and $\\gcd(ab,12)=1$.\n- Let $d=6$. We have $11 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$. The condition requires $\\chi(11)=\\chi(5)$. However, $\\chi(11)=1$ and $\\chi(5)=-1$. So $\\chi$ is not induced from a character mod $6$.\n- Let $d=4$. We have $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. The condition requires $\\chi(5)=\\chi(1)$. However, $\\chi(5)=-1$ and $\\chi(1)=1$. So $\\chi$ is not induced from a character mod $4$.\n- Let $d=3$. We have $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. The condition requires $\\chi(7)=\\chi(1)$. However, $\\chi(7)=-1$ and $\\chi(1)=1$. So $\\chi$ is not induced from a character mod $3$.\n\nSince $\\chi$ is not induced by a character of any smaller modulus that is a proper divisor of $12$, $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $12$. Its conductor is $f_{\\chi}=12$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the minimal cyclotomic field and the conductor.\nMinimal cyclotomic field: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_1)$\nConductor: $12$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_1) & 12\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3011236"}, {"introduction": "Dirichlet characters, particularly primitive ones, have profound connections that extend throughout number theory.

It is an integer that satisfies one of two conditions:\n1. $D$ is squarefree and $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n2. $D = 4d$, where $d$ is a squarefree integer and $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nWe must find the integers $D$ that satisfy these conditions for $|D|=120$. The two candidates are $D=120$ and $D=-120$.\n\nLet's examine $D = 120$.\nThe prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5$. Since $120$ is divisible by $2^2=4$, it is not a squarefree integer. Thus, $D=120$ cannot satisfy condition $1$.\n\nNow we check condition $2$ for $D=120$. We must be able to write $D$ as $4d$ where $d$ is squarefree.\n$120 = 4 \\times 30$.\nHere, $d=30$. We check if $d=30$ is squarefree. The prime factorization of $30$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5$. Since it has no repeated prime factors, $d=30$ is squarefree.\nNext, we check the congruence condition for $d$.\n$30 = 7 \\times 4 + 2$, so $30 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nThis satisfies the requirement $d \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nSince $D=120$ can be written as $4d$ with $d=30$ being squarefree and $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, we conclude that $D=120$ is a fundamental discriminant.\n\nNext, let's examine $D = -120$.\nThe integer $-120$ is also not squarefree, as it is divisible by $4$. Thus, $D=-120$ cannot satisfy condition $1$.\n\nNow we check condition $2$ for $D=-120$. We must write $D$ as $4d$ where $d$ is squarefree.\n$-120 = 4 \\times (-30)$.\nHere, $d=-30$. An integer is squarefree if it is not divisible by the square of any prime. Since $-30 = -1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 5$, it is not divisible by $4$, $9$, $25$, etc. Thus, $d=-30$ is squarefree.\nNext, we check the congruence condition for $d$.\n$-30 = (-8) \\times 4 + 2$, so $-30 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nThis satisfies the requirement $d \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nSince $D=-120$ can be written as $4d$ with $d=-30$ being squarefree and $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, we conclude that $D=-120$ is also a fundamental discriminant.\n\nWe have found exactly two fundamental discriminants with absolute value $120$: $D_1 = 120$ and $D_2 = -120$.\nEach of these corresponds to a unique primitive quadratic Dirichlet character of conductor $120$. The character corresponding to $D=120$ is $\\chi_1(\\cdot) = \\left(\\frac{120}{\\cdot}\\right)$, and the character corresponding to $D=-120$ is $\\chi_2(\\cdot) = \\left(\\frac{-120}{\\cdot}\\right)$.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly $2$ primitive quadratic Dirichlet characters modulo $120$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3011261"}]}
