For an integer $H$ with $1 \\leq H \\leq q$, consider the short character sum $S(N,H) = \\sum_{n=N+1}^{N+H} \\chi(n)$. The Burgess method for bounding $|S(N,H)|$ proceeds by applying the $r$-fold differencing and Hölder inequality for a fixed integer $r \\geq 2$, together with the Weil bound for character sums over finite fields. A standard consequence of these steps is that there exists a parameter $U$ with $1 \\leq U \\leq H$ for which one obtains a bound of the schematic form\n$$\n|S(N,H)| \\ll H^{\\,1 - 1/r}\\,\\Big( q^{\\,1/(2r)}\\,U \\;+\\; q^{\\,1/(2r^{2})}\\,U^{-1} \\Big),\n$$\nwhere the factor $H^{\\,1 - 1/r}$ arises from the $r$-th moment via Hölder inequality, and the $q$-powers reflect inputs of square-root cancellation from the Weil bound and the distribution of the $r$-fold differencing variables. By optimizing in the auxiliary parameter $U$ using only first principles (for example, classical calculus or the arithmetic mean–geometric mean inequality), one can compress the two competing contributions inside the parentheses into a single power of $q$.\n\nTreat $U$ as a positive real variable (ignoring integrality constraints) and minimize the expression in parentheses.

The problem instructs us to find the optimal bound by minimizing the expression in parentheses, treating $U$ as a positive real variable. Let the expression to be minimized be denoted by $f(U)$:\n$$\nf(U) = q^{\\frac{1}{2r}}\\,U + q^{\\frac{1}{2r^2}}\\,\\frac{1}{U}\n$$\nThe problem states that \"one can compress the two competing contributions inside the parentheses into a single power of $q$\". This strongly suggests a method that balances the two terms, such as the arithmetic mean–geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality. Although the problem mentions a contextual constraint $1 \\leq U \\leq H$, the instruction to treat $U$ as a positive real variable for optimization, combined with the goal of \"compressing\" the terms, implies we should find the unconstrained global minimum of $f(U)$ for $U > 0$. The minimum for the constrained problem might occur at a boundary and would not involve \"compressing\" the two terms into one.\n\nWe will use the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers $x$ and $y$, their arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to their geometric mean: $\\frac{x+y}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{xy}$, with equality holding if and only if $x=y$.\n\nLet $x = q^{\\frac{1}{2r}}\\,U$ and $y = q^{\\frac{1}{2r^2}}\\,U^{-1}$. Since $q$ is a prime and $U$ is positive, both $x$ and $y$ are positive. Applying the AM-GM inequality:\n$$\nf(U) = x + y \\geq 2\\sqrt{xy}\n$$\nThe minimum value of $f(U)$ is therefore $2\\sqrt{xy}$.

The minimum is achieved when $x=y$, which corresponds to choosing $U$ such that $q^{\\frac{1}{2r}}\\,U = q^{\\frac{1}{2r^2}}\\,U^{-1}$, leading to $U^2 = q^{\\frac{1}{2r^2}}/q^{\\frac{1}{2r}} = q^{\\frac{1-r}{2r^2}}$. Since $r\\geq 2$, the exponent is negative, so the optimal $U$ is less than $1$. This confirms that the unconstrained minimum lies outside the original range $[1, H]$, justifying our interpretation of the problem's instructions to find the global minimum for $U>0$.\n\nNow, we substitute this minimized expression back into the bound for $|S(N,H)|$:\n$$\n|S(N,H)| \\ll H^{1 - 1/r} \\left( 2 q^{\\frac{r+1}{4r^2}} \\right)\n$$\nThe constant factor of $2$ can be absorbed into the Vinogradov symbol $\\ll$, as it does not depend on the main parameters $H$ or $q$.
