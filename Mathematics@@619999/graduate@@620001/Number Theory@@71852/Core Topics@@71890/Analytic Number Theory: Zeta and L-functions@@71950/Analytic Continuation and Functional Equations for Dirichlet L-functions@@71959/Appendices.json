This exercise guides you through computing two of these essential invariants: the conductor, which identifies the 'true' modulus of the character, and the parity, which determines the form of the gamma factor in the equation. Mastering these calculations for a concrete example is the first step toward understanding the structure of the functional equation [@problem_id:3007713].", "problem": "Let $\\chi_4$ be the Dirichlet character modulo $4$ defined by $\\chi_4(n)=0$ if $n$ is even, $\\chi_4(n)=1$ if $n\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\chi_4(n)=-1$ if $n\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Recall that a Dirichlet character modulo $q$ is a completely multiplicative function $\\chi:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ that is periodic modulo $q$, vanishes on integers $n$ with $\\gcd(n,q)\\neq 1$, and satisfies $|\\chi(n)|=1$ for integers $n$ coprime to $q$.

We will address each part in turn, based on the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we determine the parity of the character $\\chi_4$. The parity of a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ is defined as the value $\\chi(-1)$. To find the parity of $\\chi_4$, we must evaluate $\\chi_4(-1)$. According to the problem statement, the value of $\\chi_4(n)$ depends on the congruence class of $n$ modulo $4$. We observe that $-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. The definition of $\\chi_4$ states that if $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\chi_4(n) = -1$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\n\\chi_4(-1) = -1\n$$\nThis is the parity of the character $\\chi_4$.\n\nSecond, we must determine the conductor of $\\chi_4$, which we denote as $q(\\chi_4)$. The problem defines the conductor of a character $\\chi$ as the smallest positive integer $f$ such that $\\chi$ is induced from a *primitive* Dirichlet character modulo $f$. An equivalent and more direct way to find the conductor of a character $\\chi$ given modulo $q$ is to find the smallest divisor $f$ of $q$ such that there exists a character $\\chi'$ modulo $f$ with the property that $\\chi(n) = \\chi'(n)$ for all integers $n$ satisfying $\\gcd(n, q) = 1$. If such a character $\\chi'$ exists for a divisor $f  q$, we say $\\chi$ is induced by $\\chi'$. If no such character exists for any proper divisor $f$ of $q$, then $\\chi$ is called a *primitive* character modulo $q$, and its conductor is $q$.\n\nThe character $\\chi_4$ is given as a character modulo $q=4$. The positive divisors of $4$ are $1$, $2$, and $4$. To find the conductor of $\\chi_4$, we must check if it can be induced from a character modulo a proper divisor of $4$, i.e., modulo $f=1$ or $f=2$.\n\nCase 1: Check for modulus $f=1$.\nThere is only one Dirichlet character modulo $1$, the trivial character $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}$, which is defined as $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}(n) = 1$ for all integers $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $\\gcd(n,1)=1$ for all $n$). If $\\chi_4$ were induced by $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}$, it would have to satisfy $\\chi_4(n) = \\chi_{\\text{triv}}(n) = 1$ for all integers $n$ such that $\\gcd(n, 4) = 1$. The integers coprime to $4$ are the odd integers. Let's test this condition. For $n=3$, we have $\\gcd(3, 4) = 1$. The definition of $\\chi_4$ gives $\\chi_4(3) = -1$. However, the condition for being induced by $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}$ would require $\\chi_4(3) = 1$. Since $-1 \\neq 1$, $\\chi_4$ is not induced by the character modulo $1$.\n\nCase 2: Check for modulus $f=2$.\nThe group of units modulo $2$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is the trivial group containing only the residue class of $1$. Thus, there is only one Dirichlet character modulo $2$. This is the principal character modulo $2$, let's call it $\\chi'_2$, defined by $\\chi'_2(n) = 1$ if $\\gcd(n, 2) = 1$ (i.e., $n$ is odd), and $\\chi'_2(n) = 0$ if $\\gcd(n, 2) \\neq 1$ (i.e., $n$ is even). If $\\chi_4$ were induced by this character $\\chi'_2$, it would have to satisfy $\\chi_4(n) = \\chi'_2(n)$ for all integers $n$ with $\\gcd(n, 4) = 1$. For any such $n$, $n$ must be odd, which implies $\\gcd(n,2)=1$, so $\\chi'_2(n)=1$. The condition thus becomes that $\\chi_4(n) = 1$ for all $n$ coprime to $4$. Again, we test this with $n=3$. We have $\\gcd(3, 4) = 1$, and $\\chi_4(3) = -1$. The condition requires $\\chi_4(3) = 1$. Since $-1 \\neq 1$, $\\chi_4$ is not induced by the character modulo $2$.\n\nSince $\\chi_4$ is not induced by a character of any modulus $f$ that is a proper divisor of its own modulus $q=4$, $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $4$. By definition, the conductor of a primitive character is its modulus. Therefore, the conductor of $\\chi_4$ is $q(\\chi_4) = 4$.\n\nCombining our findings, the conductor is $q(\\chi_4) = 4$ and the parity is $\\chi_4(-1) = -1$. The problem requests the answer as a two-entry row vector $(q(\\chi_4), \\chi_4(-1))$.

The same holds for $L(s,\\psi)$ with modulus $q_{0}$.\n\nStep 1: Determination of the conductor $q_{0}$.\n\nBy construction, $\\chi$ modulo $12$ is induced from $\\psi$ modulo $3$ in the sense that for $\\gcd(n,12)=1$ we set $\\chi(n)=\\psi(n)$ and for $\\gcd(n,12)1$ we set $\\chi(n)=0$. Therefore, $\\chi$ is induced from the primitive character $\\psi$ modulo $3$. We must verify that no smaller modulus $q_{0}'$ with $q_{0}'\\mid 12$ induces $\\chi$.\n\nThe proper divisors of $12$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $6$.\n\n- If $q_{0}'=1$, then the only character modulo $1$ is the trivial character, which on integers coprime to $12$ would be identically $1$.

Hence $q_{0}=3$ is admissible.\n\n- For $q_{0}'=4$ or $6$, if $\\chi$ were induced from a primitive character modulo $4$ or $6$, its restriction to integers coprime to $12$ would be periodic modulo $4$ or $6$ respectively and arise from those moduli.
