No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ modulo $p^k$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $k \\geq 2$ is an integer. The character $\\chi$ is determined by two parameters: an integer $a$ with $0 \\leq a \\leq p-2$ defining its restriction to the subgroup $\\mu_{p-1}$, and an integer $s$ with $0 \\leq s \\leq k-1$ related to its restriction to the subgroup of principal units $U_1$. Specifically, $\\chi(1+p)$ is a root of unity of exact order $p^s$.\n\nThe group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ decomposes as an internal direct product $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mu_{p-1} \\times U_1$, where $\\mu_{p-1}$ is the cyclic group of order $p-1$ consisting of the $(p-1)$-th roots of unity, and $U_1 = 1+p\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$ is the cyclic group of principal units of order $p^{k-1}$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $U_1$ is generated by the element $u=1+p$. The character $\\chi$ is uniquely determined by its values on the generators of $\\mu_{p-1}$ and $U_1$. The data provided specifies $\\chi$'s behavior on these components.\n\nThe conductor of $\\chi$, denoted $\\operatorname{cond}(\\chi)$, is the smallest integer $d>0$ such that $\\chi$ is induced by a character modulo $d$. For a character modulo $p^k$, the conductor must be of the form $p^m$ for some $0 \\leq m \\leq k$. A character $\\chi$ modulo $p^k$ has a conductor $p^m$ if and only if $m$ is the minimal integer such that $\\chi$ is trivial on the kernel of the natural projection $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/p^m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This kernel is precisely the subgroup $U_m = 1 + p^m\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$. To handle the case of the principal character, whose conductor is $1=p^0$, we can define $U_0 := (\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. Thus, the conductor of $\\chi$ is $p^m$, where $m$ is the smallest integer in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ such that $\\chi$ is trivial on $U_m$.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the conductor $\\operatorname{cond}(\\chi)$\n\nWe determine the minimal $m$ described above based on the parameters $a$ and $s$.\n\nCase 1: The principal character.\nThe character $\\chi$ is the principal character if and only if it is trivial on the entire group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This requires its restrictions to both $\\mu_{p-1}$ and $U_1$ to be trivial.\nThe restriction $\\chi|_{\\mu_{p-1}}$ is trivial if and only if $a=0$.\nThe restriction $\\chi|_{U_1}$ is trivial if and only if $\\chi(1+p)=1$, since $1+p$ generates $U_1$. The order of $\\chi(1+p)$ is $p^s$, so $\\chi(1+p)=1$ if and only if $p^s=1$, which means $s=0$.\nThus, $\\chi$ is the principal character if and only if $(a,s) = (0,0)$.\nIn this case, $\\chi$ is trivial on $U_0 = (\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The minimal such $m$ is $0$.\nSo, if $a=0$ and $s=0$, the conductor is $p^0=1$.\n\nCase 2: The character is non-trivial, but its restriction to $U_1$ is trivial.\nThis corresponds to $s=0$ but $a \\neq 0$. Since $s=0$, $\\chi$ is trivial on $U_1$. Since $a \\neq 0$, $\\chi$ is not the principal character, so it is not trivial on $U_0 = (\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The smallest integer $m$ for which $\\chi$ is trivial on $U_m$ is therefore $m=1$.\nSo, if $a \\neq 0$ and $s=0$, the conductor is $p^1=p$. This is consistent with $\\chi$ being a non-trivial character of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ lifted to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\nCase 3: The character's restriction to $U_1$ is non-trivial.\nThis corresponds to $s \\geq 1$. This implies $\\chi$ is not trivial on $U_1$, so the conductor exponent $m$ must be greater than $1$. We seek the minimal $m$ such that $\\chi$ is trivial on $U_m$.\nThe group $U_m$ is a subgroup of $U_1$. Since $U_1$ is cyclic of order $p^{k-1}$ generated by $1+p$, its subgroups are also cyclic. The subgroup $U_m$ has order $|U_m|=|1+p^m\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}| = p^{k-m}$. It is the unique subgroup of $U_1$ of this order. A generator for this subgroup is $(1+p)^{p^{k-1 - (k-m)}} = (1+p)^{p^{m-1}}$.\nFor $\\chi$ to be trivial on $U_m$, it must be trivial on its generator. So, we require:\n$$ \\chi\\left((1+p)^{p^{m-1}}\\right) = 1 $$\nUsing the homomorphism property of $\\chi$:\n$$ \\left(\\chi(1+p)\\right)^{p^{m-1}} = 1 $$\nWe are given that $\\chi(1+p)$ has exact order $p^s$. Therefore, the condition becomes that $p^{m-1}$ must be a multiple of $p^s$. This is equivalent to the inequality $m-1 \\geq s$, or $m \\geq s+1$.\nSince we seek the minimal integer $m$, we must have $m=s+1$. This holds for any $s \\geq 1$.\nSo, if $s \\geq 1$, the conductor is $p^{s+1}$. Note that if $s \\geq 1$, we have $m = s+1 \\geq 2$. This conductor is greater than $p$, so it correctly subsumes any requirement from the $a \\neq 0$ case.\n\nCombining these results, the conductor of $\\chi$ is $p^m$, where $m$ is given by:\n$$ m = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } a=0 \\text{ and } s=0 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } a\\neq 0 \\text{ and } s=0 \\\\ s+1 & \\text{if } s \\geq 1 \\end{cases} $$\nThe expression for the conductor is therefore $\\operatorname{cond}(\\chi) = p^m$.\n\n### 2. Condition for $\\chi$ to be primitive\n\nA character $\\chi$ modulo $p^k$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $p^k$. Using the results from part 1, this means we require the conductor exponent $m$ to be equal to $k$.\nLet's examine the cases:\n- If $(a,s) = (0,0)$, then $m=0$. Since $k \\geq 2$, $m \\neq k$.\n- If $a \\neq 0$ and $s=0$, then $m=1$. Since $k \\geq 2$, $m \\neq k$.\n- If $s \\geq 1$, then $m=s+1$. For $\\chi$ to be primitive, we need $m=k$, which implies $s+1=k$, or $s=k-1$.\n\nThe condition $k \\geq 2$ ensures that if $s=k-1$, then $s \\geq 1$, so we are correctly in this case. The condition is independent of the parameter $a$, which can be any integer in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}$.\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for $\\chi$ to be primitive is $s=k-1$.\nIn terms of the $p$-adic filtration, the conductor of $\\chi$ is $p^k$ if and only if $\\chi$ is trivial on $U_k=\\{1\\}$, which is always true, but is not trivial on any $U_m$ for $m<k$. This is equivalent to $\\chi$ being non-trivial on $U_{k-1}$. Our condition $s=k-1$ means that the order of $\\chi(1+p)$ is $p^{k-1}$. The generator of $U_{k-1}$ is $(1+p)^{p^{k-2}}$.\n$$ \\chi((1+p)^{p^{k-2}}) = (\\chi(1+p))^{p^{k-2}} $$\nThis value is not equal to $1$ if and only if the order of $\\chi(1+p)$, which is $p^s$, does not divide $p^{k-2}$. This means $s > k-2$, so $s \\geq k-1$. As we are given $s \\leq k-1$, the only possibility is $s=k-1$. This confirms the condition.\n\n### 3. Total number of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo $p^k$\n\nWe need to count the number of characters $\\chi$ modulo $p^k$ that are primitive. From part 2, this is equivalent to counting the number of characters for which $s=k-1$.\n\nA character $\\chi$ on $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mu_{p-1} \\times U_1$ is uniquely determined by its restrictions to $\\mu_{p-1}$ and $U_1$. Let $\\chi_1 = \\chi|_{\\mu_{p-1}}$ and $\\chi_2 = \\chi|_{U_1}$.\nThe group of characters $\\widehat{\\mu_{p-1}}$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The choice of $\\chi_1$ is specified by the parameter $a \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-2\\}$, giving $p-1$ possible choices for $\\chi_1$.\nThe group of characters $\\widehat{U_1}$ is cyclic of order $p^{k-1}$. The choice of $\\chi_2$ is specified by its value on the generator $u=1+p$. The value $\\chi_2(u)$ must be a $p^{k-1}$-th root of unity. The parameter $s$ gives the exponent of the order of $\\chi(u)=\\chi_2(u)$.\nThe condition for $\\chi$ to be primitive is $s=k-1$. This means the order of $\\chi_2(1+p)$ must be exactly $p^{k-1}$. In other words, $\\chi_2(1+p)$ must be a primitive $p^{k-1}$-th root of unity.\nThe number of primitive $n$-th roots of unity is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$. Thus, the number of choices for $\\chi_2(1+p)$ is $\\phi(p^{k-1})$.\nThe formula for Euler's function at a prime power is $\\phi(p^j) = p^j - p^{j-1}$.\nSo, the number of choices for $\\chi_2$ that satisfy the primitivity condition is:\n$$ \\phi(p^{k-1}) = p^{k-1} - p^{k-2} = p^{k-2}(p-1) $$\nThe total number of primitive characters is the product of the number of independent choices for $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$.\nNumber of choices for $a$ (determining $\\chi_1$): $p-1$.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_2$ (such that $s=k-1$): $\\phi(p^{k-1}) = p^{k-2}(p-1)$.\nTotal number of primitive characters = $(p-1) \\times (p^{k-2}(p-1)) = p^{k-2}(p-1)^2$.\n\nThis result can be verified by the standard formula for the number of primitive characters modulo $p^k$, which is $\\phi(p^k) - \\phi(p^{k-1})$ for $k \\ge 1$.\nFor $k \\ge 2$:\n$$ \\phi(p^k) - \\phi(p^{k-1}) = (p^k - p^{k-1}) - (p^{k-1} - p^{k-2}) $$\n$$ = p^{k-1}(p-1) - p^{k-2}(p-1) $$\n$$ = (p-1)(p^{k-1} - p^{k-2}) $$\n$$ = (p-1)p^{k-2}(p-1) = p^{k-2}(p-1)^2 $$\nThis confirms our derived result.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{p^{k-2}(p-1)^2} $$"}]}
