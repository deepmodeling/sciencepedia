We will proceed by addressing each of the four specified tasks in order.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$, and the Dirichlet eta function, $\\eta(s)$. For $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$, the series defining $\\zeta(s)$ and $\\eta(s)$ are absolutely convergent. We begin with the series for $\\zeta(s)$:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s} = \\frac{1}{1^s} + \\frac{1}{2^s} + \\frac{1}{3^s} + \\frac{1}{4^s} + \\dots\n$$\nWe can separate the sum into terms with even and odd denominators:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k-1)^s} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k)^s}\n$$\nThe sum over even terms can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k)^s} = \\frac{1}{2^s} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^s} = 2^{-s} \\zeta(s)\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k-1)^s} + 2^{-s} \\zeta(s)\n$$\nNow, consider the Dirichlet eta function, defined for $\\operatorname{Re}(s) > 0$ by the conditionally convergent series:\n$$\n\\eta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s} = \\frac{1}{1^s} - \\frac{1}{2^s} + \\frac{1}{3^s} - \\frac{1}{4^s} + \\dots\n$$\nFor $\\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$, we can rearrange the series and separate it into sums over odd and even terms:\n$$\n\\eta(s) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k-1)^s} - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k)^s}\n$$\nWe have already expressed the sum over even terms as $2^{-s} \\zeta(s)$. We can express the sum over odd terms from the relation for $\\zeta(s)$ as $\\zeta(s) - 2^{-s} \\zeta(s)$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\eta(s)$:\n$$\n\\eta(s) = (\\zeta(s) - 2^{-s} \\zeta(s)) - 2^{-s} \\zeta(s) = \\zeta(s) - 2 \\cdot 2^{-s} \\zeta(s) = \\zeta(s) (1 - 2^{1-s})\n$$\nSo, we have derived the relation $\\eta(s) = (1 - 2^{1-s})\\zeta(s)$. This identity was derived under the assumption that $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$. However, the function $\\eta(s)$ is known to be analytic for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ (its defining series converges for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)0$, and this defines an analytic function that can be continued to the whole plane). The function $\\zeta(s)$ is analytic everywhere except for a simple pole at $s=1$. The factor $(1 - 2^{1-s})$ is an entire function. By the principle of analytic continuation, this identity, proven on the half-plane $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  1$, must hold for all $s$ where both sides are analytic, which is for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ except for the pole of $\\zeta(s)$ at $s=1$.\n\nSecond, we evaluate $\\eta(-1)$ using Abel summation. The series for $\\eta(-1)$ is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{n-1} n = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\dots$, which diverges. The Abel sum is defined as the limit of a power series. We consider the generating function $G(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{n-1} n x^{n}$ for $|x|  1$. To find a closed form for $G(x)$, we start with the geometric series:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1+x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-x)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n x^n, \\quad |x|1\n$$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{1+x} \\right) = \\frac{-1}{(1+x)^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^n n x^{n-1}\n$$\nMultiplying by $-x$, we obtain the desired series $G(x)$:\n$$\nG(x) = -x \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^n n x^{n-1} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{n-1} n x^{n} = -x \\left( \\frac{-1}{(1+x)^2} \\right) = \\frac{x}{(1+x)^2}\n$$\nThe analytically continued value of the series is the Abel sum, obtained by taking the limit as $x \\to 1^{-}$:\n$$\n\\eta(-1) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^{-}} G(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^{-}} \\frac{x}{(1+x)^2} = \\frac{1}{(1+1)^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nThird, we compute $\\zeta(-1)$ using the relation $\\eta(s) = (1 - 2^{1-s})\\zeta(s)$. We can solve for $\\zeta(s)$ as long as $1 - 2^{1-s} \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\frac{\\eta(s)}{1 - 2^{1-s}}\n$$\nWe substitute $s=-1$:\n$$\n\\zeta(-1) = \\frac{\\eta(-1)}{1 - 2^{1-(-1)}} = \\frac{\\eta(-1)}{1 - 2^2} = \\frac{\\eta(-1)}{1 - 4} = \\frac{1/4}{-3} = -\\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\nFourth, we evaluate $\\zeta(2)$ using the provided functional equation:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = 2^{s} \\pi^{s-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(1-s) \\zeta(1-s)\n$$\nWe wish to set $s=2$. A direct substitution leads to the indeterminate form $0 \\cdot \\infty$, because $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ and $\\Gamma(-1)$ is a simple pole of the gamma function. We must evaluate the limit of the product $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(1-s)$ as $s \\to 2$. We use the Gamma function's reflection formula $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$ and the sine double-angle identity $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$.\nLet's rewrite $\\Gamma(1-s)$ using the reflection formula with $z=s$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(1-s) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi s)\\Gamma(s)}\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the product of interest:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(1-s) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi s)\\Gamma(s)}\n$$\nUsing the double-angle identity, $\\sin(\\pi s) = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)$, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(s)} = \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(s)}\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined as $s \\to 2$. We can now take the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{s \\to 2} \\left( \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(1-s) \\right) = \\lim_{s \\to 2} \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(s)} = \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\cos(\\pi) \\Gamma(2)}\n$$\nWe know that $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ and $\\Gamma(2) = (2-1)! = 1! = 1$. Therefore, the limit is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{2(-1)(1)} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nNow we can substitute this result back into the functional equation evaluated at $s=2$:\n$$\n\\zeta(2) = \\lim_{s \\to 2} \\left[ 2^{s} \\pi^{s-1} \\zeta(1-s) \\left( \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(1-s) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\zeta(2) = 2^{2} \\pi^{2-1} \\zeta(1-2) \\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\zeta(2) = 4\\pi \\zeta(-1) \\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = -2\\pi^2 \\zeta(-1)\n$$\nFinally, using our previously computed value $\\zeta(-1) = -1/12$:\n$$\n\\zeta(2) = -2\\pi^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{12} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the value of $\\zeta(2)$, also known as the solution to the Basel problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}}$$", "id": "3007554"}, {"introduction": "The functional equation does more than relate values; it imposes profound structural symmetries on the Riemann zeta function, with deep implications for the location and nature of its zeros.

Therefore, the order of vanishing of $\\xi(s)$ at $s=\\frac{1}{2}$ is the same as that of $\\zeta(s)$, which is $m$.\n\nNext, we analyze the constraints imposed by the functional equation $\\xi(s)=\\xi(1-s)$.

The Taylor series of an even function about its center of symmetry must contain only even powers of the expansion variable.

The order of vanishing, $m$, is the index of the first non-zero derivative in the Taylor expansion. Since all odd-order derivatives are zero, $m$ cannot be an odd number. For example, if $m=1$ (a simple zero), it would mean $\\xi^{(1)}(\\frac{1}{2}) \\neq 0$, which contradicts the symmetry requirement. Therefore, the order of vanishing $m$ must be an even integer.\n\nThe problem assumes $\\zeta(\\frac{1}{2})=0$, which implies $\\xi(\\frac{1}{2})=0$, so the order of vanishing $m$ must be at least 1. Since $m$ must be an even integer, the smallest possible value for $m$ is 2.\n\nThus, the minimal possible order of vanishing for $\\xi(s)$ at $s=\\frac{1}{2}$ that is compatible with its functional symmetry is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3007593"}]}
