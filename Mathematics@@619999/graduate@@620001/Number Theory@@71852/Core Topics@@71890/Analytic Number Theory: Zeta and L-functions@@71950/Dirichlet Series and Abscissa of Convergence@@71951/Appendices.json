We will proceed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Identification of the function $F(s)$\nThe Dirichlet series is given by\n$$ F(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{a}\\, n^{-s} $$\nwhere $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a fixed real number and $s$ is a complex variable. The general term of the series can be combined using the laws of exponents:\n$$ n^{a}\\, n^{-s} = n^{a-s} = n^{-(s-a)} $$\nTherefore, the series can be written as\n$$ F(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-(s-a)} $$\nThis is the standard series definition of the Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-z}$, evaluated at the argument $z = s-a$. Thus, we identify $F(s)$ as:\n$$ F(s) = \\zeta(s-a) $$\n\nPart 2: Determination of the abscissa of absolute convergence $\\sigma_{a}(F)$\nThe abscissa of absolute convergence, $\\sigma_a(F)$, is defined as the infimum of the set of real numbers $\\sigma = \\Re(s)$ for which the series converges absolutely. The series of absolute values is given by\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |n^{a}\\, n^{-s}| $$\nLet $s = \\sigma + it$, where $\\sigma, t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We can evaluate the absolute value of the general term:\n$$ |n^{a}\\, n^{-s}| = |n^a| |n^{-\\sigma - it}| $$\nSince $n \\ge 1$ is a positive integer and $a$ is real, $n^a = \\exp(a \\ln n)$ is always positive, so $|n^a| = n^a$. The second term is\n$$ |n^{-\\sigma - it}| = |n^{-\\sigma} n^{-it}| = |n^{-\\sigma}| |n^{-it}| = n^{-\\sigma} |\\exp(-it \\ln n)| = n^{-\\sigma} \\cdot 1 = n^{-\\sigma} $$\nCombining these, the general term of the series of absolute values is\n$$ |n^{a}\\, n^{-s}| = n^a n^{-\\sigma} = n^{a-\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{n^{\\sigma-a}} $$\nThe series of absolute values is therefore the real-valued series\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{\\sigma-a}} $$\nThis is a p-series, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$, with exponent $p = \\sigma - a$. To determine its convergence, we use the integral test. The function $f(x) = x^{-p}$ is positive, continuous, and decreasing for $x \\ge 1$ provided that $p>0$. The series converges if and only if the improper integral $\\int_1^{\\infty} f(x) dx$ converges.\n\nFor $p \\neq 1$, the integral is\n$$ \\int_{1}^{\\infty} x^{-p} dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \\right]_{1}^{b} = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{b^{1-p}}{1-p} - \\frac{1}{1-p} \\right) $$\nThis limit exists and is finite if and only if the exponent $1-p$ is negative, i.e., $1-p < 0$, which implies $p > 1$.\nFor $p=1$, the integral is\n$$ \\int_1^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} [\\ln(x)]_1^b = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\ln(b) = \\infty $$\nThe integral diverges. Thus, the p-series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges if and only if $p>1$.\n\nFor our series of absolute values, the exponent is $p = \\sigma-a$. Convergence requires $\\sigma-a > 1$, which is equivalent to $\\sigma > 1+a$.\nThe set of real numbers $\\sigma$ for which the series $F(s)$ converges absolutely is the interval $(1+a, \\infty)$. The abscissa of absolute convergence $\\sigma_a(F)$ is the infimum of this set.\n$$ \\sigma_a(F) = \\inf\\{ \\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\sigma > 1+a \\} = 1+a $$\n\nPart 3: Discussion of convergence behavior\nWe analyze the convergence in the different half-planes defined by $\\sigma = \\Re(s)$.\n\nRegime $\\sigma > 1+a$:\nAs established in Part 2, for any $s$ such that $\\Re(s) = \\sigma > 1+a$, the series of absolute values $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |n^a n^{-s}|$ converges. By definition, this means the series $F(s)$ converges absolutely in this half-plane.\n\nRegime $\\sigma \\le 1+a$:\nWe must determine if the series converges or diverges in this region. We split the analysis into two sub-cases.\nSub-case 1: $\\sigma \\le a$.\nLet $c_n = n^a n^{-s}$ be the general term of the series. Its absolute value is $|c_n| = n^{a-\\sigma}$. Since $\\sigma \\le a$, the exponent $a-\\sigma \\ge 0$.\nIf $\\sigma < a$, then $a-\\sigma > 0$, and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |c_n| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{a-\\sigma} = \\infty$.\nIf $\\sigma = a$, then $a-\\sigma = 0$, and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |c_n| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^0 = 1$.\nIn either scenario, the terms of the series do not approach zero, i.e., $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} c_n \\neq 0$. By the term test for divergence, the series $F(s)$ diverges for all $s$ with $\\Re(s) \\le a$.\n\nSub-case 2: $a < \\sigma \\le 1+a$.\nIn this strip, the series does not converge absolutely, as shown in Part 2. We investigate conditional convergence using summation by parts (Abel summation). Let $z = s-a$. We are analyzing the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-z}$ for $0 < \\Re(z) \\le 1$.\nLet $a_n = 1$ and $f(n) = n^{-z}$. Then the partial sum is $A(x) = \\sum_{1 \\le n \\le x} 1 = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$.\nThe Abel summation formula states:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^{-z} = A(N) f(N) - \\int_1^N A(t) f'(t) dt = \\lfloor N \\rfloor N^{-z} - \\int_1^N \\lfloor t \\rfloor (-z t^{-z-1}) dt $$\nUsing $\\lfloor t \\rfloor = t - \\{t\\}$, where $0 \\le \\{t\\} < 1$ is the fractional part:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^{-z} = (N-\\{N\\})N^{-z} + z \\int_1^N (t-\\{t\\})t^{-z-1} dt $$\n$$ = N^{1-z} - \\{N\\}N^{-z} + z \\int_1^N t^{-z} dt - z \\int_1^N \\{t\\}t^{-z-1} dt $$\nFor $z \\ne 1$, the first integral is $\\int_1^N t^{-z} dt = \\frac{N^{1-z}-1}{1-z}$. Substituting this back gives:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^{-z} = N^{1-z} - \\{N\\}N^{-z} + z \\left(\\frac{N^{1-z}-1}{1-z}\\right) - z \\int_1^N \\{t\\}t^{-z-1} dt $$\n$$ = N^{1-z} \\left(1 + \\frac{z}{1-z}\\right) - \\{N\\}N^{-z} - \\frac{z}{1-z} - z \\int_1^N \\{t\\}t^{-z-1} dt $$\n$$ = \\frac{N^{1-z}}{1-z} - \\{N\\}N^{-z} - \\frac{z}{1-z} - z \\int_1^N \\{t\\}t^{-z-1} dt $$\nWe examine the limit as $N \\to \\infty$. Let $\\Re(z) = \\sigma-a > 0$.\nThe integral term converges since $|\\{t\\}t^{-z-1}| \\le t^{-(\\Re(z)+1)}$ and $\\int_1^\\infty t^{-(\\Re(z)+1)} dt$ converges because the exponent $\\Re(z)+1 > 1$.\nThe term $\\{N\\}N^{-z}$ converges to $0$ since $|\\{N\\}N^{-z}| \\le N^{-\\Re(z)}$ and $\\Re(z) > 0$.\nThe convergence of the series thus depends on the behavior of the term $\\frac{N^{1-z}}{1-z}$.\nThe magnitude is $|N^{1-z}| = N^{1-\\Re(z)}$.\n- If $a < \\sigma < 1+a$, this means $0 < \\Re(z) < 1$. Then $1-\\Re(z) > 0$, so $|N^{1-z}| \\to \\infty$. The series diverges.\n- If $\\sigma = 1+a$, this means $\\Re(z) = 1$. Let $z = 1+i\\tau$ with $\\tau = \\Im(z) = t$. If $\\tau = 0$, then $z=1$, which corresponds to $s=1+a$ being real. In this case, $F(s)$ is the harmonic series $\\sum n^{-1}$, which diverges. If $\\tau \\ne 0$, the term $N^{1-z} = N^{-i\\tau} = \\exp(-i\\tau \\ln N)$ oscillates and does not converge to a limit. Therefore, the series diverges for all $s$ on the line $\\Re(s)=1+a$.\n\nCombining all cases, the series $F(s)$ diverges for all $s$ such that $\\Re(s) \\le 1+a$.\n\nConclusion on conditional convergence:\nThe series $F(s)$ converges absolutely for $\\Re(s) > 1+a$ and diverges for $\\Re(s) \\le 1+a$. There is no region in the complex plane where the series converges conditionally. The abscissa of convergence $\\sigma_c(F)$ is equal to the abscissa of absolute convergence $\\sigma_a(F) = 1+a$.

The abscissa of absolute convergence, $\\sigma_a$, of the Dirichlet series $F(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n n^{-s}$ is defined as the infimum of all $\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that the series of absolute values, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n n^{-s}|$, converges.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the terms $|a_n n^{-s}|$. The coefficient $a_n$ is defined to be either $1$ or $0$, so its absolute value is simply $|a_n| = a_n$. The term $n^{-s}$ can be expressed as:\n$$\n|n^{-s}| = |n^{-(\\sigma + it)}| = |n^{-\\sigma} n^{-it}| = |n^{-\\sigma}| |n^{-it}|\n$$\nSince $n$ is a positive integer and $\\sigma$ is a real number, $|n^{-\\sigma}| = n^{-\\sigma}$.

The coefficient $a_n$ is $1$ if $n$ is a $k$-th power of a natural number, i.e., $n = m^k$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and $a_n=0$ otherwise.

The Dirichlet convolution of two arithmetic functions $f$ and $g$ is defined as $(f * g)(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} f(d)g(n/d)$.\nLet $f(n) = \\operatorname{id}_{k}(n) = n^{k}$ and $g(n) = \\mathbf{1}(n) = 1$.\nApplying the definition of the Dirichlet convolution:\n$$\n(\\operatorname{id}_{k} * \\mathbf{1})(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} \\operatorname{id}_{k}(d) \\mathbf{1}(n/d)\n$$\nBy the definitions of $\\operatorname{id}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{1}$, we have $\\operatorname{id}_{k}(d) = d^{k}$ and $\\mathbf{1}(n/d) = 1$. Substituting these into the sum gives:\n$$\n(\\operatorname{id}_{k} * \\mathbf{1})(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} d^{k} \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{d \\mid n} d^{k}\n$$\nThis is precisely the definition of the arithmetic function $\\sigma_{k}(n)$. Thus, we have proven that $\\sigma_{k} = \\operatorname{id}_{k} * \\mathbf{1}$.\n\nNext, we deduce the factorization of the Dirichlet series $F(s) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}(n)}{n^{s}}$. A fundamental property of Dirichlet series states that if an arithmetic function $h$ is the convolution of two functions $f$ and $g$, i.e., $h = f * g$, then its Dirichlet series $D(h, s)$ is the product of the individual Dirichlet series $D(f, s)$ and $D(g, s)$, provided they all converge absolutely.\n$$\nD(h, s) = D(f, s) D(g, s)\n$$\nIn our case, $h = \\sigma_{k}$, $f = \\operatorname{id}_{k}$, and $g = \\mathbf{1}$. So, $F(s) = D(\\sigma_k, s) = D(\\operatorname{id}_k, s) D(\\mathbf{1}, s)$.\n\nLet's identify these two factors.\nThe first factor is the Dirichlet series for the function $\\mathbf{1}(n) = 1$:\n$$\nD(\\mathbf{1}, s) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{1}{n^{s}}\n$$\nThis is the well-known Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$.\nThe second factor is the Dirichlet series for the function $\\operatorname{id}_{k}(n) = n^{k}$:\n$$\nD(\\operatorname{id}_{k}, s) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{n^{k}}{n^{s}} = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{1}{n^{s-k}}\n$$\nThis is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at $s-k$, which is $\\zeta(s-k)$.\nTherefore, the factorization of $F(s)$ is:\n$$\nF(s) = \\zeta(s-k) \\zeta(s)\n$$\nThe problem requires identifying these factors via their Euler products, starting from the fact that $\\operatorname{id}_k$ and $\\mathbf{1}$ are completely multiplicative. A function $f$ is completely multiplicative if $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$ for all integers $m, n \\ge 1$. For such functions, the Dirichlet series has an Euler product representation of the form $\\prod_{p} (1 - f(p)p^{-s})^{-1}$, where the product is over all prime numbers $p$.\n\nFor the function $\\mathbf{1}(n)$, which is completely multiplicative, we have $\\mathbf{1}(p) = 1$ for any prime $p$. Its Dirichlet series is:\n$$\n\\zeta(s) = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^{s}}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nFor the function $\\operatorname{id}_{k}(n) = n^k$, which is also completely multiplicative, we have $\\operatorname{id}_{k}(p) = p^k$. Its Dirichlet series is:\n$$\n\\zeta(s-k) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{n^k}{n^s} = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 - \\frac{p^k}{p^{s}}\\right)^{-1} = \\prod_{p} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p^{s-k}}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThus, the factors are indeed $\\zeta(s-k)$ and $\\zeta(s)$.\n\n### Part 2: Abscissa of Absolute Convergence $\\sigma_{a}$\n\nThe abscissa of absolute convergence, $\\sigma_{a}$, is the infimum of all $\\sigma = \\Re(s)$ such that the series $\\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{|\\sigma_{k}(n)|}{|n^{s}|}$ converges. Since $k$ is a nonnegative integer, all divisors $d$ of $n$ are positive integers, so $d^k \\ge 0$. This implies $\\sigma_k(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d^k > 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. Therefore, we only need to determine the convergence of the series of positive terms $\\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}(n)}{n^{\\sigma}}$.\n\nTo find $\\sigma_a$, we establish an upper and a lower bound for it.\n\n**Upper bound for $\\sigma_{a}$**:\nThe Dirichlet series for $F(s)$ is the product of the Dirichlet series for $\\zeta(s-k)$ and $\\zeta(s)$. A product of two Dirichlet series converges absolutely in any half-plane where both factors converge absolutely.\nThe series for $\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} n^{-s}$ converges absolutely for $\\Re(s) > 1$.\nThe series for $\\zeta(s-k) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} n^{-(s-k)}$ converges absolutely for $\\Re(s-k) > 1$, which is equivalent to $\\Re(s) > k+1$.\nFor both series to converge absolutely, we need $\\Re(s) > 1$ and $\\Re(s) > k+1$. Since $k$ is a nonnegative integer, $k \\ge 0$, which implies $k+1 \\ge 1$. Thus, the condition for absolute convergence of both series simplifies to $\\Re(s) > k+1$.\nThis means that the series for $F(s)$ converges absolutely for $\\sigma = \\Re(s) > k+1$. By the definition of the abscissa of absolute convergence, this implies $\\sigma_{a} \\le k+1$.\n\n**Lower bound for $\\sigma_{a}$**:\nTo find a lower bound, we show that the series fails to converge absolutely for $\\sigma = k+1$. The series of magnitudes at $\\sigma = k+1$ is $\\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}(n)}{n^{k+1}}$.\nFor any integer $n \\ge 1$, $n$ is a divisor of itself. The definition $\\sigma_{k}(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} d^{k}$ includes the term for $d=n$. As all terms in the sum are non-negative, we have the lower bound $\\sigma_k(n) \\ge n^k$.\nUsing this inequality, we can compare our series to a known divergent series:\n$$\n\\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}(n)}{n^{k+1}} \\ge \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{n^{k}}{n^{k+1}} = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nThe series on the right is the harmonic series, which is known to diverge. Since all terms are positive, the comparison test implies that $\\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}(n)}{n^{k+1}}$ also diverges.\nThe failure of absolute convergence at $\\sigma = k+1$ means that the abscissa of absolute convergence must be greater than or equal to $k+1$, i.e., $\\sigma_{a} \\ge k+1$.\n\nCombining the two bounds, $\\sigma_{a} \\le k+1$ and $\\sigma_{a} \\ge k+1$, we conclude that the abscissa of absolute convergence is $\\sigma_{a} = k+1$.\n\n### Part 3: Abscissa of Ordinary Convergence $\\sigma_{c}$\n\nThe abscissa of ordinary convergence, $\\sigma_{c}$, is the infimum of all $\\sigma = \\Re(s)$ such that the series $\\sum_{n \\ge 1} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}(n)}{n^{s}}$ converges.\nFor any Dirichlet series, it is a general property that $\\sigma_{c} \\le \\sigma_{a}$.\nHowever, for a Dirichlet series $\\sum a_n n^{-s}$ with non-negative coefficients, $a_n \\ge 0$ for all $n$, the abscissa of convergence is equal to the abscissa of absolute convergence, i.e., $\\sigma_{c} = \\sigma_{a}$.\n\nLet's demonstrate this. We already know $\\sigma_{c} \\le \\sigma_{a}$. We need to show $\\sigma_{a} \\le \\sigma_{c}$.\nLet's assume the series converges at some point $s_0 = \\sigma_0 + i t_0$. Then, by definition of $\\sigma_c$, we have $\\sigma_c \\le \\sigma_0$. We want to show that if the series converges at $s_0$, it must converge absolutely for any $s$ with $\\Re(s) > \\sigma_0$.\nLet $\\sigma = \\Re(s) > \\sigma_0$. The terms of the series of absolute values are $|a_n n^{-s}| = a_n n^{-\\sigma}$ since $a_n \\ge 0$.\nThe series $\\sum a_n n^{-s_0}$ converges. By Abel's summation formula (or integration by parts for sums), for any $\\sigma > \\sigma_0$, the series $\\sum a_n n^{-\\sigma}$ converges. Since its terms are non-negative, this is a series of absolute values, so it converges absolutely. This means $\\sigma_a \\le \\sigma$ for any $\\sigma > \\sigma_0$. Taking the infimum over all such $\\sigma$, we get $\\sigma_a \\le \\sigma_0$.\nThis means that for any point $s_0$ of convergence, we have $\\sigma_a \\le \\Re(s_0)$.\nThe abscissa of convergence $\\sigma_c$ is the infimum of these values $\\Re(s_0)$. Therefore, $\\sigma_a \\le \\sigma_c$.\nCombining with $\\sigma_c \\le \\sigma_a$, we must have $\\sigma_c = \\sigma_a$.\n\nIn our problem, the coefficients are $a_n = \\sigma_{k}(n)$. As established before, $\\sigma_k(n) > 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$ because $k$ is a non-negative integer. Hence, the theorem for series with non-negative coefficients applies.\nTherefore, the abscissa of ordinary convergence is the same as the abscissa of absolute convergence:\n$$\n\\sigma_{c} = \\sigma_{a} = k+1\n$$\nThis result can also be confirmed by Landau's theorem on singularities, which states that for a Dirichlet series with non-negative coefficients, the abscissa of convergence $\\sigma_c$ is equal to the rightmost real singularity of the function represented by the series. The function is $F(s) = \\zeta(s-k)\\zeta(s)$. It has poles at $s=1$ (from $\\zeta(s)$) and $s=k+1$ (from $\\zeta(s-k)$). Since $k \\ge 0$, the rightmost pole is at $k+1$, so $\\sigma_c = k+1$.\n\nThe final answer requires the two abscissae in the order $(\\sigma_c\\ \\sigma_a)$. Both are equal to $k+1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk+1 & k+1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3011540"}]}
