No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the Gauss sum $\\tau(\\chi)$ for the unique primitive quadratic Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $5$, and a verification that its square is $5$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the values of the character $\\chi(a)$ for $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The modulus is $p=5$. The character $\\chi$ is defined based on whether an integer $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$.\n\nThe non-zero integers modulo $5$ are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. We compute their squares:\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nThe set of non-zero quadratic residues modulo $5$ is $\\{1, 4\\}$. The set of quadratic non-residues is $\\{2, 3\\}$.\nAccording to the definition of $\\chi$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\chi(a) = 1$ if $a \\in \\{1, 4\\}$ (quadratic residues).\n    \\item $\\chi(a) = -1$ if $a \\in \\{2, 3\\}$ (quadratic non-residues).\n    \\item $\\chi(a) = 0$ if $\\gcd(a, 5) \\neq 1$, which applies to $a=5$ in the given range.

The Gauss sum can be written as:\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = \\sum_{a=1}^{5} \\chi(a) \\zeta^a $$\nSubstituting the values of $\\chi(a)$:\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = \\chi(1)\\zeta^1 + \\chi(2)\\zeta^2 + \\chi(3)\\zeta^3 + \\chi(4)\\zeta^4 + \\chi(5)\\zeta^5 $$\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = (1)\\zeta^1 + (-1)\\zeta^2 + (-1)\\zeta^3 + (1)\\zeta^4 + (0)\\zeta^5 $$\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = \\zeta - \\zeta^2 - \\zeta^3 + \\zeta^4 $$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we use the property of the primitive root of unity $\\zeta$. It is a root of the $5$-th cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_5(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. Thus, we have the fundamental relation:\n$$ 1 + \\zeta + \\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3 + \\zeta^4 = 0 $$\nAlso note that for any integer $k$, $\\zeta^k = \\zeta^{k \\pmod{5}}$, and $\\zeta^5 = 1$. The complex conjugate of $\\zeta^k$ is $\\overline{\\zeta^k} = \\zeta^{-k} = \\zeta^{5-k}$.

We compute the square directly:\n$$ \\tau(\\chi)^2 = [(\\zeta + \\zeta^4) - (\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3)]^2 = (\\zeta + \\zeta^4)^2 - 2(\\zeta + \\zeta^4)(\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3) + (\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3)^2 $$\nLet's compute each part:\n$(\\zeta + \\zeta^4)^2 = \\zeta^2 + 2\\zeta^5 + \\zeta^8 = \\zeta^2 + 2\\zeta^0 + \\zeta^3 = \\zeta^2 + 2 + \\zeta^3$.\n$(\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3)^2 = \\zeta^4 + 2\\zeta^5 + \\zeta^6 = \\zeta^4 + 2\\zeta^0 + \\zeta^1 = \\zeta^4 + 2 + \\zeta$.\n$(\\zeta + \\zeta^4)(\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3) = \\zeta^3 + \\zeta^4 + \\zeta^6 + \\zeta^7 = \\zeta^3 + \\zeta^4 + \\zeta^1 + \\zeta^2$.\nUsing the cyclotomic relation, $\\zeta + \\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3 + \\zeta^4 = -1$.\nSo, $(\\zeta + \\zeta^4)(\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3) = -1$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\tau(\\chi)^2$:\n$$ \\tau(\\chi)^2 = (\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3 + 2) - 2(-1) + (\\zeta + \\zeta^4 + 2) $$\n$$ \\tau(\\chi)^2 = (\\zeta + \\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3 + \\zeta^4) + 4 + 2 $$\n$$ \\tau(\\chi)^2 = (-1) + 6 = 5 $$\nThis verifies that $\\tau(\\chi)^2 = 5$. This implies that $\\tau(\\chi)$ must be either $\\sqrt{5}$ or $-\\sqrt{5}$. The sign of the squared result is positive.\n\nTo find the exact value of $\\tau(\\chi)$, we must determine its sign. We can express the sum in terms of cosines:\n$\\zeta + \\zeta^4 = \\zeta + \\bar{\\zeta} = 2\\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)$.\n$\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3 = \\zeta^2 + \\overline{\\zeta^2} = 2\\operatorname{Re}(\\zeta^2) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right)$.\nSo,\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) - 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right) $$\nTo find the values of these cosines, we return to the cyclotomic polynomial relation $1 + \\zeta + \\zeta^2 + \\zeta^3 + \\zeta^4 = 0$. Dividing by $\\zeta^2$ (which is non-zero) gives:\n$$ \\zeta^{-2} + \\zeta^{-1} + 1 + \\zeta + \\zeta^2 = 0 $$\n$$ (\\zeta^2 + \\zeta^{-2}) + (\\zeta + \\zeta^{-1}) + 1 = 0 $$\nLet $y = \\zeta + \\zeta^{-1} = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)$. Then $y^2 = \\zeta^2 + 2 + \\zeta^{-2}$, so $\\zeta^2+\\zeta^{-2} = y^2-2$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ (y^2 - 2) + y + 1 = 0 $$\n$$ y^2 + y - 1 = 0 $$\nThe solutions for $y$ are given by the quadratic formula: $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nSince $\\frac{2\\pi}{5}$ is an angle in the first quadrant, its cosine is positive. Thus, $y = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)$ must be positive. We choose the positive root:\n$$ 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} $$\nThe other value, $2\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right)$, can be found by a similar method. Let $z = \\zeta^2 + \\zeta^{-2}$. $z$ is also a root of $y^2+y-1=0$. Since $\\frac{4\\pi}{5}$ is in the second quadrant, its cosine is negative. Thus, we must choose the negative root:\n$$ 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right) = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} $$\nNow we can compute $\\tau(\\chi)$:\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = \\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5} - (-1 - \\sqrt{5})}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5} + 1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} $$\n$$ \\tau(\\chi) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\sqrt{5} $$\nThe exact value of the Gauss sum is $\\sqrt{5}$.

Let's verify this:\n- If $y=0$, the congruence is $x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, which has one solution $x=0$. The formula gives $1 + \\left(\\frac{0}{p}\\right) = 1+0=1$.\n- If $y$ is a non-zero quadratic residue modulo $p$, then $\\left(\\frac{y}{p}\\right)=1$.

Since $p \\nmid a$, the map $y \\mapsto ay$ is an automorphism of $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $\\{ay \\bmod p\\}_{y=0}^{p-1}$ is a complete residue system modulo $p$.

This implies $G_k(a;p) = p^{m} G_{k \\bmod 2}(a;p)$ where $k=2m + (k \\bmod 2)$. For $k=1$, it is a standard result that $G_1(a;p) = (\\frac{a}{p})G_1(1;p)$. For $k=0$, $G_0(a;p)=1$, so the relation holds.\nIf $k$ is even, $k=2m$, then $G_{2m}(a;p) = p^m G_0(a;p) = p^m$. Also $(\\frac{a}{p})^{2m} G_{2m}(1;p) = 1 \\cdot p^m = p^m$. The relation holds.\nIf $k$ is odd, $k=2m+1$, then $G_{2m+1}(a;p) = p^m G_1(a;p) = p^m (\\frac{a}{p}) G_1(1;p)$. Also $(\\frac{a}{p})^{2m+1} G_{2m+1}(1;p) = (\\frac{a}{p}) (p^m G_1(1;p))$. The relation holds.\nSince $(\\frac{a}{p})^k = (\\frac{a}{p})^{k \\bmod 2}$, the second claim is also correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Statement B Evaluation**\nThis statement concerns the case $p=2$, with $a$ odd.\n1.  $\\lvert G_k(a;2)\\rvert = 2^{(k+1)/2}$ for $k \\ge 3$.\nIt is a known result that for $a$ odd,\n-   If $k \\ge 2$ is even, $G_k(a;2) = (1+i^a) 2^{k/2}$, so $\\lvert G_k(a;2)\\rvert = \\lvert 1+i^a \\rvert 2^{k/2} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2^{k/2} = 2^{(k+1)/2}$.\n-   If $k \\ge 3$ is odd, $G_k(a;2) = e_8(a) 2^{(k+1)/2}$, so $\\lvert G_k(a;2)\\rvert = 2^{(k+1)/2}$.\nSo for all $k \\ge 2$, the magnitude is $2^{(k+1)/2}$. This is therefore true for $k \\ge 3$.\n\n2.  $G_k(a;2)$ depends only on $a \\bmod 8$ up to a factor in $\\{\\pm 1,\\pm i\\}$.\nFrom the formulas above, if $k$ is odd ($k \\ge 3$), $G_k(a;2) = e_8(a) 2^{(k+1)/2}$, which depends on $a \\pmod 8$. If $a' \\equiv a \\pmod 8$, then $G_k(a';2)=G_k(a;2)$.\nIf $k$ is even ($k \\ge 2$), $G_k(a;2) = (1+i^a) 2^{k/2}$, which depends on $a \\pmod 4$. A function of $a \\pmod 4$ is also a function of $a \\pmod 8$. The value $G_k(a;2)$ is uniquely determined by $a \\pmod 8$.\nThe phrase \"up to a factor in $\\{\\pm 1,\\pm i\\}$\" accurately describes how the value changes with $a$. For example, for odd $k \\ge 3$, $G_k(a+2;2)/G_k(a;2) = e_8(2)=i$.\n\n3.  $G_1(a;2)=0$ for odd $a$.\n$G_1(a;2) = \\sum_{x=0}^1 e_2(ax^2) = e_2(0) + e_2(a) = 1 + \\exp(\\pi i a) = 1 + (-1) = 0$. This is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Statement C Evaluation**\nThis statement discusses stationary points for the phase $f(x)=ax^2+b x$ when $p$ is an odd prime and $p \\nmid a$. The stationary points are roots of the derivative $f'(x)=2ax+b$.\nThe condition for a stationary point modulo $p^k$ is $2ax+b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$.\nSince $p$ is an odd prime and $p \\nmid a$, the coefficient $2a$ is invertible modulo $p^k$. That is, $\\gcd(2a, p^k)=1$.\nTherefore, the linear congruence $2ax \\equiv -b \\pmod{p^k}$ has a unique solution for $x$ modulo $p^k$ for any integer $b$. This solution is $x \\equiv (-b)(2a)^{-1} \\pmod{p^k}$.\nThe statement claims that a solution exists only when $p \\mid b$, which is false.\nIt then concludes \"in general there is no unique stationary point modulo $p^k$\". This is also false; as just shown, there is always a unique stationary point. The premise and conclusion are both incorrect. The statement seems to confuse the case $p$ odd with the challenges that arise when $p=2$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Statement D Evaluation**\nThis statement claims Hensel's Lemma cannot be used to lift square roots modulo powers of $2$. Let's analyze this for $f(x) = x^2 - u$ where $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\nWe start with a solution $x_0$ to $x^2 \\equiv u \\pmod 8$, which means $x_0$ is odd.\nThe derivative is $f'(x_0) = 2x_0$. The $2$-adic valuation is $v_2(f'(x_0))=1$ since $x_0$ is odd.\nA version of Hensel's Lemma (specifically, the one for lifting past a singular point, or the more general form) applies here. Let $t=v_2(f'(x_0)) = 1$.\nWe have a solution $x_k$ modulo $2^k$ for $k \\ge 3$. Since $k \\ge 3 > 2t=2$, we are in the stable range of Hensel's Lemma.\nFor each root $x_k \\pmod{2^k}$, there is a unique root $x_{k+1} \\pmod{2^{k+1}}$ such that $x_{k+1} \\equiv x_k \\pmod{2^{k-1}}$.\nThe lifting procedure is systematic. Given $x_k^2 = u + m 2^k$, we seek $x_{k+1} = x_k + c 2^{k-1}$.\n$(x_k + c 2^{k-1})^2 \\equiv u \\pmod{2^{k+1}} \\implies x_k^2 + c x_k 2^k \\equiv u \\pmod{2^{k+1}}$.\n$u+m2^k + c x_k 2^k \\equiv u \\pmod{2^{k+1}} \\implies (m+cx_k)2^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2^{k+1}}$.\nThis requires $m+cx_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since $x_k$ is odd, $x_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So $c \\equiv -m \\pmod 2$ has a unique solution.\nThis provides a systematic way to lift any solution modulo $2^k$ to a unique solution modulo $2^{k+1}$ for all $k \\ge 3$. In fact, it is a cornerstone of $p$-adic number theory that $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2^\\times$ is a square if and only if $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. So the statement is fundamentally wrong.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Statement E Evaluation**\nThis statement claims that if $p \\mid a$, then $G_k(a;p)=0$.\nLet $a = p^s b$ with $s \\ge 1$ and $p \\nmid b$.\nIf $k \\le s$, $a$ is a multiple of $p^k$. Then $ax^2$ is always a multiple of $p^k$, so $\\mathrm{e}_{p^k}(ax^2)=1$ for all $x$.\nThen $G_k(a;p) = \\sum_{x \\bmod p^k} 1 = p^k \\ne 0$.\nIf $k > s$, let $m=k-s \\ge 1$.\n$G_k(a;p) = \\sum_{x \\bmod p^k} \\mathrm{e}_{p^k}(p^s b x^2) = \\sum_{x \\bmod p^k} \\mathrm{e}_{p^{k-s}}(b x^2) = \\sum_{x \\bmod p^k} \\mathrm{e}_{p^m}(b x^2)$.\nSince the summand $\\mathrm{e}_{p^m}(b x^2)$ has period $p^m$ in $x$, we can reduce the sum:\n$ G_k(a;p) = \\frac{p^k}{p^m} \\sum_{x \\bmod p^m} \\mathrm{e}_{p^m}(b x^2) = p^{k-m} G_m(b;p) = p^s G_{k-s}(b;p) $.\nSince $p \\nmid b$, we know from statement A that $G_{k-s}(b;p)$ is non-zero. Thus $G_k(a;p)$ is non-zero.\nThe statement is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Statement F Evaluation**\nThis statement provides a conceptual contrast between the cases of odd $p$ and $p=2$.\nPart 1 (for odd $p$): The phase is $f(x)=ax^2+bx$. The derivative is $f'(x)=2ax+b$. For an odd prime $p$ with $p \\nmid a$, $2a$ is invertible mod $p$. The equation $2ax+b \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ has a unique solution $x_0$. The second derivative $f''(x)=2a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, so the critical point $x_0$ is non-degenerate. By Hensel's Lemma, it lifts to a unique root modulo $p^k$. Completing the square on $ax^2+bx$ is possible because $2a$ is invertible mod $p^k$, and this procedure reduces the sum $\\sum_x e_{p^k}(ax^2+bx)$ to a scalar multiple of $G_k(a;p)$, as shown in the analysis for C. This part is an accurate summary.\n\nPart 2 (for $p=2$): The derivative $2ax+b$ is indeed always congruent to $b \\pmod 2$. For the sum $G_k(a;2)$, we have $b=0$, so the derivative $2ax$ is $0 \\pmod 2$ for all $x$. All points are critical, so the critical point is degenerate. This prevents the direct application of the simple stationary phase principle or Hensel's Lemma as used for odd $p$. The evaluation for $p=2$ requires a different method, typically splitting the sum over even and odd residues (cosets of $2\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$). This different analysis is precisely what reveals the dependence on arithmetic modulo $8$ (e.g., $u$ being a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ iff $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$) and leads to the different magnitude $|G_k(a;2)| = 2^{(k+1)/2}$ instead of $2^{k/2}$. The statement provides a correct and insightful explanation for the dichotomy.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "3015130"}]}
