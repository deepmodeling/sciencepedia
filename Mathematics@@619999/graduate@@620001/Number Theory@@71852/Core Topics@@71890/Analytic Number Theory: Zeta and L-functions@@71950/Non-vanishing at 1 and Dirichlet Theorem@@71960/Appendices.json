The multiplicative group of integers modulo $5$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, consists of the residue classes $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This group is cyclic of order $\\phi(5) = 4$.

The four $4$-th roots of unity are $\\{1, \\mathrm{i}, -1, -\\mathrm{i}\\}$, where $\\mathrm{i}^2 = -1$.\n\nThis implies there are exactly four Dirichlet characters modulo $5$.

Substituting the indicator function, we obtain:\n$$\nS_a(X) = \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{1}{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\phi(q)} \\sum_{\\psi \\pmod{q}} \\overline{\\psi(a)} \\psi(p) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\phi(q)} \\sum_{\\psi \\pmod{q}} \\overline{\\psi(a)} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\psi(p)}{p}\n$$\nFor our case, $q=4$, $\\phi(4)=2$, and the characters are $\\chi_0$ and $\\chi$.\n\nFor the residue class $a=1$:\nSince $\\chi_0(1)=1$ and $\\chi(1)=1$, we have:\n$$\nS_1(X) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\overline{\\chi_0(1)} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p} + \\overline{\\chi(1)} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}\n$$\nFor the residue class $a=3$:\nSince $\\chi_0(3)=1$ and $\\chi(3)=-1$, we have:\n$$\nS_3(X) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\overline{\\chi_0(3)} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p} + \\overline{\\chi(3)} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}\n$$\nTo understand the behavior of $S_1(X)$ and $S_3(X)$, we must analyze the two prime sums on the right-hand side.\n\n1.  **The Principal Character Sum**: The principal character $\\chi_0$ modulo $4$ is defined as $\\chi_0(n)=1$ if $\\gcd(n,4)=1$ (i.e., $n$ is odd) and $\\chi_0(n)=0$ if $\\gcd(n,4)\\neq 1$ (i.e., $n$ is even). For primes $p$, $\\chi_0(p)=1$ for all odd primes, and $\\chi_0(2)=0$. Thus,\n    $$\n    \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p} = \\sum_{\\substack{p \\le X \\\\ p \\text{ odd}}} \\frac{1}{p} = \\left(\\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{1}{p}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\n    $$\n    By Mertens' second theorem, the sum of reciprocal primes diverges, with the asymptotic behavior $\\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{1}{p} \\sim \\log\\log X + M$, where $M$ is the Meissel–Mertens constant. Therefore, the principal character contribution diverges as $\\log\\log X$.\n\n2.  **The Non-Principal Character Sum**: The behavior of $\\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}$ is connected to the Dirichlet $L$-series $L(s, \\chi) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\chi(n)}{n^s}$. For $\\Re(s)>1$, this series has an Euler product $L(s,\\chi) = \\prod_p (1-\\chi(p)p^{-s})^{-1}$. Taking the logarithm gives:\n    $$\n    \\log L(s, \\chi) = \\sum_p -\\log(1 - \\chi(p)p^{-s}) = \\sum_p \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\chi(p^k)}{p^{ks}} = \\sum_p \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p^s} + \\sum_p \\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\chi(p^k)}{p^{ks}}\n    $$\n    The second term on the right, $\\sum_{p, k\\ge 2}$, converges for $\\Re(s) > 1/2$. A crucial theorem states that for any non-principal character $\\chi$, the $L$-series $L(s,\\chi)$ has an analytic continuation to the whole complex plane, and importantly, $L(1,\\chi) \\neq 0$. Since $L(1,\\chi)$ is a finite, non-zero complex number, its logarithm $\\log L(1,\\chi)$ is well-defined and finite. As $s \\to 1^+$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\log L(1, \\chi) = \\lim_{s \\to 1^+} \\left( \\sum_p \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p^s} \\right) + \\text{a convergent series}\n    $$\n    This implies that the series $\\sum_p \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}$ converges. Let its value be $B_\\chi$. By extension, the partial sum $\\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}$ converges to $B_\\chi$ as $X \\to \\infty$.\n\nCombining these results, we find the asymptotic behavior of $S_1(X)$ and $S_3(X)$:\n$$\nS_1(X) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (\\log\\log X) + \\frac{1}{2} B_\\chi + O(1)\n$$\n$$\nS_3(X) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (\\log\\log X) - \\frac{1}{2} B_\\chi + O(1)\n$$\nThis shows that both $S_1(X)$ and $S_3(X)$ diverge at the same rate, proportional to $\\log\\log X$. More precisely, they both exhibit the asymptotic behavior $\\sim \\frac{1}{2} \\log\\log X$. This explains why the normalized quantities $N_1(X) = S_1(X)/\\log\\log X$ and $N_3(X) = S_3(X)/\\log\\log X$ are expected to approach the limit $\\frac{1}{\\phi(4)} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe divergence of these sums is the core of Dirichlet's theorem for this case. If there were only a finite number of primes in the residue class $a \\pmod q$, the corresponding sum $S_a(X)$ would be a finite sum of fixed terms, and thus would converge to a constant. The fact that the sum diverges proves that there must be infinitely many such primes.\n\nThe difference $D(X) = S_1(X) - S_3(X)$ is given by:\n$$\nD(X) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi_0(p)}{p} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}\\right) = \\sum_{p \\le X} \\frac{\\chi(p)}{p}\n$$\nAs established, this sum converges to the constant $B_\\chi$ as $X \\to \\infty$. The numerical experiment should show $D(X)$ approaching a stable value.\n\nThe algorithm will first generate all primes up to the maximum cutoff $X$ using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Then, for each cutoff, it will iterate through the primes, partitioning them into residue classes $1 \\pmod 4$ and $3 \\pmod 4$, and calculating the required counts ($C_1, C_3$) and sums ($S_1, S_3$). Finally, it will compute the derived quantities $N_1, N_3, D, R$.", "answer": "```\n[[100,0.492112,0.810696,0.322209,0.530825,-0.318584,11,13,0.846154],[5000,0.817349,1.066468,0.381329,0.497519,-0.249119,327,338,0.967456],[100000,1.062086,1.294191,0.435738,0.530939,-0.232105,4783,4808,0.994800],[1000000,1.238713,1.463131,0.457815,0.540778,-0.224418,39179,39320,0.996414]]\n```", "id": "3019540"}]}
