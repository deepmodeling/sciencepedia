These invariants are defined by the asymptotic formula for the order of the minus component of the $n$-th class group $A_n^-$, which is given as $|A_{n}^{-}|=3^{\\lambda n+\\mu\\cdot 3^{n}+\\nu}$ for all sufficiently large $n$.\n\nFirst, we utilize the Ferrero-Washington theorem, which is provided as an available tool. The theorem states that for any abelian number field $F$ and any prime $p$, the Iwasawa $\\mu$-invariant of the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$ is zero. The base field in this problem is $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, which is an abelian extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the Iwasawa $\\mu$-invariant for the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-extension of $K$ is $\\mu(X)=0$. The Iwasawa module $X$ decomposes as $X=X^+ \\oplus X^-$, which implies that the invariants are additive, i.e., $\\mu(X) = \\mu(X^+) + \\mu(X^-)$. Since Iwasawa invariants are non-negative integers, we must have $\\mu(X^-)=0$. Thus, we conclude that the invariant $\\mu$ is zero.\n\nThe formula for the order of the class groups simplifies to $|A_{n}^{-}|=3^{\\lambda n+\\nu}$ for all sufficiently large $n$, say $n \\geq n_0$ for some integer $n_0$. A standard result in Iwasawa theory (cf. L. Washington, \"Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields\", Prop. 13.22) states that for the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of any abelian number field, the norm maps on the $p$-parts of the ideal class groups are surjective for all layers. In our context, this means the norm map $N_{m,n}: A_m \\to A_n$ is surjective for all $m \\ge n \\ge 0$. The surjectivity of these maps implies that the asymptotic formula for the group orders is exact for all $n \\ge 0$. Therefore, we can set the stability index $n_0=0$. The formula we will use is thus:\n$$|A_{n}^{-}|=3^{\\lambda n+\\nu} \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 0.$$\n\nTo determine the two unknown integer invariants $\\lambda$ and $\\nu$, we need to evaluate the order of $A_n^-$ for two distinct values of $n$. We will use $n=0$ and $n=1$.\n\nFor $n=0$, the field is $K_0 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{3^{0+1}}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$. The group $A_0$ is the $3$-primary part of the ideal class group of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$. It is a foundational result that the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ has class number $h_3=1$, as its ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_3]$ is a principal ideal domain. Since the class group is trivial, its $3$-primary part $A_0$ is also trivial, i.e., $A_0 = \\{1\\}$. The minus part $A_0^-$ is a subgroup of $A_0$, so it must also be trivial: $|A_0^-|=1$.\nSubstituting $n=0$ and $|A_0^-|=1$ into our formula yields:\n$$1 = 3^{\\lambda \\cdot 0 + \\nu} = 3^\\nu$$\nThis implies that $\\nu=0$.\n\nFor $n=1$, the field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{3^{1+1}}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9)$. The group $A_1$ is the $3$-primary part of the ideal class group of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9)$. It is another known result in the theory of cyclotomic fields that the class number of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9)$ is $h_9=1$. Therefore, the class group of $K_1$ is trivial, and so is its $3$-primary part, $A_1=\\{1\\}$. Consequently, the minus part is also trivial: $|A_1^-|=1$.\nSubstituting $n=1$, $|A_1^-|=1$, and our just-derived value $\\nu=0$ into the formula yields:\n$$1 = 3^{\\lambda \\cdot 1 + 0} = 3^\\lambda$$\nThis implies that $\\lambda=0$.\n\nWe have thus derived all three Iwasawa invariants for the module $X^-$:\n$\\lambda = 0$\n$\\mu = 0$\n$\\nu = 0$\n\nThe mention of Vandiver’s conjecture for $p=3$ serves to confirm the context. The conjecture states that $p$ does not divide the class number of the maximal real subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p+\\zeta_p^{-1})$. For $p=3$, this subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}$, whose class number is $1$. As $3 \\nmid 1$, the conjecture holds. A major consequence of Vandiver's conjecture is the triviality of the plus-part of the Iwasawa module, $X^+=\\{1\\}$, meaning $\\lambda^+=\\mu^+=\\nu^+=0$. Our calculation shows that for $p=3$, the minus-part $X^-$ is also trivial. This is an exceptional case among primes.\n\nThe implication of these invariants being zero is that the growth of the $3$-class groups $A_n^-$ is trivial. The formula $|A_n^-| = 3^{0 \\cdot n + 0 \\cdot 3^n + 0} = 3^0 = 1$ demonstrates that the minus part of the $3$-primary ideal class group is trivial for all fields $K_n = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{3^{n+1}})$ in the cyclotomic tower. That is, $A_n^- = \\{1\\}$ for all $n \\ge 0$. This is consistent with the inverse limit $X^- = \\varprojlim A_n^-$ being the trivial module, which by the structure theorem has characteristic polynomial $f(T)=1$, corresponding to invariants $\\lambda=0$ and $\\mu=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3016362"}, {"introduction": "Building on our theoretical understanding, this final practice shifts our perspective to the crucial domain of computational number theory.

Let the observed values of $v_p(h_n)$ form a vector $\\mathbf{y}$, and the coefficients form a vector $\\mathbf{c} = [\\mu, \\lambda, \\nu]^T$. We can construct a design matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ where each row $i$ corresponds to an observation $n_i$ and has the form $[p^{n_i}, n_i, 1]$.

Define a discrete search space for the integer triple $(\\mu, \\lambda, \\nu)$ around the rounded values of $\\mathbf{c}_{ls}$. A small integer radius defines this search box.
