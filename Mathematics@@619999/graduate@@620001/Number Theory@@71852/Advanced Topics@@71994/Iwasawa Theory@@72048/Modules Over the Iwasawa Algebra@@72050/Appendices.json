We will determine its characteristic ideal, Iwasawa invariants, and elementary pseudo-isomorphic decomposition.\n\nFirst, we determine the characteristic ideal of $M$, denoted $\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M)$. By definition, the characteristic ideal of a finitely generated $\\Lambda$-module is its zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M)$. To compute this, we consider a presentation of the module $M$. The module $M = \\Lambda/(p T^{2})$ is a cyclic module, generated by one element (the residue class of $1$) subject to a single relation. This gives the following free presentation of $M$:\n$$ \\Lambda \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\Lambda \\to M \\to 0 $$\nHere, the map $\\phi$ is multiplication by the element $p T^{2}$. In terms of matrices, $M$ is generated by one element, so we have a presentation with a $1 \\times 1$ matrix. The map $\\phi$ is represented by the matrix $A = [p T^{2}]$.\n\nThe zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M)$, is generated by all $1 \\times 1$ minors of the presentation matrix $A$. In this case, there is only one such minor, which is the entry $p T^{2}$ itself. Therefore, the characteristic ideal is the principal ideal generated by this element:\n$$ \\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M) = \\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M) = (p T^{2}) $$\n\nNext, we are asked to find the Iwasawa invariants $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$. These invariants are determined from the unique factorization of a generator of the characteristic ideal, as guaranteed by the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem for the Iwasawa algebra $\\Lambda$. The theorem states that any non-zero element $G(T) \\in \\Lambda$ can be uniquely written as $G(T) = p^{\\mu} f(T) U(T)$, where $\\mu \\geq 0$ is an integer, $f(T)$ is a distinguished polynomial, and $U(T)$ is a unit in $\\Lambda$. A distinguished polynomial is a monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}[T]$ of the form $T^{\\lambda} + a_{\\lambda-1}T^{\\lambda-1} + \\dots + a_{0}$ such that all non-leading coefficients $a_{i}$ are divisible by $p$ (i.e., $a_i \\in p\\mathbb{Z}_p$). The Iwasawa invariants are then defined as $\\mu$ and $\\lambda = \\deg(f(T))$.\n\nThe generator for our characteristic ideal is $G(T) = p T^{2}$. We can write this as:\n$$ G(T) = p^{1} \\cdot T^{2} \\cdot 1 $$\nWe identify the components of this expression with the form from the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem.\nThe power of $p$ is $p^{1}$, so we have $\\mu = 1$.\nThe polynomial part is $f(T) = T^{2}$. To confirm this is a distinguished polynomial, we check its properties. It is a monic polynomial of degree $2$. Its non-leading coefficients are the coefficient of $T^{1}$, which is $0$, and the constant term, which is also $0$. Since $0$ is an element of $p\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, the polynomial $T^{2}$ is indeed a distinguished polynomial.\nThe remaining factor is $U(T) = 1$, which is a unit in $\\Lambda$.\nThus, the factorization $p^{1} \\cdot T^{2}$ is the canonical one. From this, we identify the Iwasawa invariants:\n- The $\\mu$-invariant is the exponent of $p$, so $\\mu = 1$.\n- The $\\lambda$-invariant is the degree of the distinguished polynomial $f(T) = T^{2}$, so $\\lambda = \\deg(T^{2}) = 2$.\nThe ordered pair of invariants is $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, 2)$.\n\nFinally, we identify the elementary pseudo-isomorphic decomposition of $M$. The structure theorem for finitely generated torsion $\\Lambda$-modules states that any such module is pseudo-isomorphic to a direct sum of elementary modules. A pseudo-isomorphism is a $\\Lambda$-module homomorphism with a finite kernel and cokernel. The structure of this direct sum is determined by the characteristic ideal.\n$$ M \\sim \\left( \\bigoplus_{i} \\Lambda/(p^{a_i}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( \\bigoplus_{j} \\Lambda/(g_j(T)^{b_j}) \\right) $$\nwhere each $g_j(T)$ is an irreducible distinguished polynomial. The characteristic ideal of such a direct sum is the principal ideal generated by the product of the individual generators: $\\left( p^{\\sum a_i} \\prod g_j(T)^{b_j} \\right)$.\n\nWe must match this form with our characteristic ideal $\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M) = (p T^{2})$. The generator is $p^{1} T^{2}$.\nThe $p$-power part of the generator is $p^{1}$. This corresponds to a direct summand $\\Lambda/(p^{1}) = \\Lambda/(p)$. Thus, $\\sum a_i = 1$, which implies a single summand with $a_1=1$.\nThe polynomial part of the generator is $T^{2}$. The polynomial $g(T) = T$ is a distinguished polynomial of degree $1$ (it is monic and its constant term is $0 \\in p\\mathbb{Z}_p$) and is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}_p[T]$ as it is of degree $1$. The factorization of the polynomial part is $T^{2} = g(T)^{2}$. This corresponds to a direct summand $\\Lambda/(T^{2})$.\nCombining these, the pseudo-isomorphic decomposition of $M$ is:\n$$ M = \\Lambda/(p T^{2}) \\sim \\Lambda/(p) \\oplus \\Lambda/(T^{2}) $$\n\nThe components of this decomposition are the $p$-power component arising from the $\\mu$-invariant, which is $\\Lambda/(p)$, and the distinguished polynomial component $\\Lambda/(T^2)$, where $T^2$ is the distinguished polynomial factor from which the $\\lambda$-invariant is derived.

Let $0 \\to M' \\to M \\to M'' \\to 0$ be a short exact sequence of finitely generated torsion $\\Lambda$-modules. Since localization is an exact functor, for any prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$, the sequence $0 \\to M'_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\to M_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\to M''_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\to 0$ is exact. The length function over a local ring is additive on short exact sequences. As $\\Lambda_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is a local ring for any prime $\\mathfrak{p}$, we have:\n$$\n\\operatorname{length}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\\mathfrak{p}}) = \\operatorname{length}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathfrak{p}}}(M'_{\\mathfrak{p}}) + \\operatorname{length}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathfrak{p}}}(M''_{\\mathfrak{p}})\n$$\nThis holds in particular for height-one primes. Thus, $e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(M) = e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(M') + e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(M'')$. From the definition of the characteristic ideal, it follows that:\n$$\n\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M') \\cdot \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M'')\n$$\nFor a direct sum $M = M_1 \\oplus M_2$, we have a split short exact sequence $0 \\to M_1 \\to M \\to M_2 \\to 0$, so $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M_1 \\oplus M_2) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M_1) \\cdot \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M_2)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. For $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$, the cyclic module $\\Lambda/(p,T)$ is a nonzero pseudo-null $\\Lambda$-module. Moreover, for any finitely generated torsion $\\Lambda$-module $M$, one has $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M \\oplus \\Lambda/(p,T)) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M)$.**\n\nThe module is $P = \\Lambda/(p,T) = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]/(p,T)$. There is a canonical isomorphism $\\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]/(p,T) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_p/p\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p$. This module is nonzero.\nThe support of $P$ is the set of prime ideals containing its annihilator, $\\operatorname{Ann}(P)=(p,T)$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Supp}(P) = V((p,T)) = \\{\\mathfrak{p} \\in \\operatorname{Spec}(\\Lambda) \\mid (p,T) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{p}\\}$.\nIn the ring $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$, the ideal $(p,T)$ is the unique maximal ideal. As $\\Lambda$ is a local ring of Krull dimension $2$, its maximal ideal has height $2$. Therefore, the only prime ideal in $\\operatorname{Supp}(P)$ is $(p,T)$, which has height $2$. The codimension of $\\operatorname{Supp}(P)$ is $\\inf\\{2\\} = 2$. By definition, a module whose support has codimension at least $2$ is pseudo-null. So, $P$ is a nonzero pseudo-null $\\Lambda$-module.\n\nFor the second part, let $P=\\Lambda/(p,T)$. We use the multiplicativity of the characteristic ideal for direct sums: $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M \\oplus P) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) \\cdot \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(P)$. To find $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(P)$, we must compute $e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(P) = \\operatorname{length}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathfrak{p}}}(P_{\\mathfrak{p}})$ for all height-one primes $\\mathfrak{p}$. Since $P$ is pseudo-null, by the equivalent definition provided, $P_{\\mathfrak{p}}=0$ for all height-one primes $\\mathfrak{p}$. Consequently, $e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(P) = \\operatorname{length}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathfrak{p}}}(0) = 0$ for all such primes. This implies $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(P) = \\prod_{\\text{ht}(\\mathfrak{p})=1} \\mathfrak{p}^0 = (1) = \\Lambda$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M \\oplus P) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) \\cdot (1) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M)$. Both parts of the statement are correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$, the cyclic module $\\Lambda/(p)$ is pseudo-null, because the ideal $(p)$ has height $1$ and pseudo-null means the support has codimension at least $1$.**\n\nThe module is $M = \\Lambda/(p) = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p[[T]]$. Its support is $\\operatorname{Supp}(M) = V((p))$. In the UFD $\\Lambda=\\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$, $p$ is a prime element, so the principal ideal $(p)$ is a prime ideal of height $1$. The support of $M$ contains the height-one prime ideal $(p)$.\nThe codimension of $\\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ is $\\inf\\{\\text{height}(\\mathfrak{q}) \\mid \\mathfrak{q} \\in V((p))\\} = \\text{height}((p)) = 1$.\nThe definition of a pseudo-null module requires the codimension of its support to be at least $2$. Since the codimension for $\\Lambda/(p)$ is $1$, this module is not pseudo-null.\nFurthermore, the reason provided is flawed. It states that pseudo-null means the support has codimension at least $1$, which contradicts the definition given in the problem statement (\"at least $2$\").\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Over $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$, any finite $\\Lambda$-module is pseudo-null. Furthermore, pseudo-null submodules do not affect the characteristic ideal, because the characteristic ideal is determined by the lengths at height-one primes.**\n\nThe term \"finite $\\Lambda$-module\" in this context refers to a module with a finite number of elements. Let $M$ be such a module.\nSince $M$ is a finite set, it is a finite abelian group, and as a $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-module, it must be a finite $p$-group. Thus, there exists an integer $k \\ge 1$ such that $p^k M = 0$. This means $p^k \\in \\operatorname{Ann}_{\\Lambda}(M)$.\nThe ring $\\Lambda/\\operatorname{Ann}_{\\Lambda}(M)$ acts faithfully on $M$. Since $M$ is finite, this quotient ring must also be finite. A finite ring is Artinian, which implies its Krull dimension is $0$. This means every prime ideal of $\\Lambda/\\operatorname{Ann}_{\\Lambda}(M)$ is a maximal ideal.\nThe prime ideals in the support of $M$, $\\operatorname{Supp}(M) = V(\\operatorname{Ann}_{\\Lambda}(M))$, correspond to the prime ideals of $\\Lambda/\\operatorname{Ann}_{\\Lambda}(M)$. Therefore, every prime ideal in $\\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ must be a maximal ideal of $\\Lambda$. The maximal ideals of the $2$-dimensional local ring $\\Lambda$ have height $2$.\nThus, the support of any finite $\\Lambda$-module consists solely of primes of height $2$. The codimension of the support is $2$, so any finite $\\Lambda$-module is pseudo-null. The first part is correct.\n\nFor the second part: \"pseudo-null submodules do not affect the characteristic ideal\". This can be interpreted in the context of an exact sequence $0 \\to P \\to M \\to M/P \\to 0$, where $P$ is a pseudo-null submodule. We have $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(P) \\cdot \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M/P)$. As shown for option A, if $P$ is pseudo-null, $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(P)=(1)$. Thus, $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M/P)$. The characteristic ideal of a module is the same as that of its quotient by any pseudo-null submodule. The reason provided, \"because the characteristic ideal is determined by the lengths at height-one primes,\" is the correct justification. Pseudo-null modules have trivial support at height-one primes and therefore do not contribute to the characteristic ideal.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Pseudo-null submodules can change the characteristic ideal by multiplying it by a nonunit ideal supported at height-$2$ primes, since such primes contribute to $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(-)$ in dimension $2$.**\n\nThis statement fundamentally misunderstands the definition of the characteristic ideal provided in the problem. The definition states explicitly:\n$$\n\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) = \\prod_{\\mathfrak{p} \\ \\textbf{height one}} \\mathfrak{p}^{e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(M)}\n$$\nThe product is taken exclusively over primes of height one. Primes of height $2$ do not contribute to this product by definition. Therefore, a submodule whose support is concentrated at primes of height $\\ge 2$ (a pseudo-null module) cannot alter the characteristic ideal. The statement is based on a false premise.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For a Noetherian normal domain $\\Lambda$ of Krull dimension $2$, a finitely generated $\\Lambda$-module $P$ is pseudo-null if and only if $P_{\\mathfrak{p}} = 0$ for every height-one prime $\\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\Lambda$. Consequently, for any finitely generated torsion $\\Lambda$-module $M$, one has $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M \\oplus P) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M)$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement is a direct quote of the equivalent definition of a pseudo-null module given in the problem statement, specialized to dimension $2$ (which is the dimension of our $\\Lambda$). The problem states that $\\Lambda$ is a regular local domain, which is a normal domain, so this equivalence applies.\nThe second part is a claimed consequence. Let $P$ be a pseudo-null module. As established previously, for a direct sum, we have $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M \\oplus P) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) \\cdot \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(P)$. A module $P$ is pseudo-null if and only if $P_{\\mathfrak{p}}=0$ for all height-one primes $\\mathfrak{p}$. This means the length $e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(P) = \\operatorname{length}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathfrak{p}}}(P_{\\mathfrak{p}}) = 0$ for all height-one primes $\\mathfrak{p}$.\nUsing the definition of the characteristic ideal, $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(P) = \\prod_{\\text{ht}(\\mathfrak{p})=1} \\mathfrak{p}^{e_{\\mathfrak{p}}(P)} = \\prod_{\\text{ht}(\\mathfrak{p})=1} \\mathfrak{p}^0 = (1)$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M \\oplus P) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M) \\cdot (1) = \\operatorname{char}_\\Lambda(M)$. The consequence follows logically and directly from the provided definitions. A pseudo-null module must be a torsion module, as its support does not contain the height-0 prime $(0)$, so $M \\oplus P$ is a torsion module.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3016367"}, {"introduction": "Beyond characteristic ideals, homological algebra offers a finer lens for examining the structure of $\\Lambda$-modules.

Let $P_1 = \\Lambda$, $P_0 = \\Lambda$, and $d_1 = \\mu_f: P_1 \\to P_0$. Then the complex $P_{\\bullet}$ is $\\dots \\to 0 \\to P_1 \\xrightarrow{d_1} P_0 \\to 0$. The augmentation map is $\\epsilon: P_0 \\to M$, which is $\\pi$. The sequence $P_{\\bullet} \\to M \\to 0$ is exact. Since it has finite length (length $1$) and all modules in the complex are free, this is an explicit finite free resolution of $M$.\n\nb) We want to compute $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{i}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f))$ for all $i \\geq 0$. The Tor functors are the derived functors of the tensor product. They can be computed by taking a projective resolution of one module, tensoring it with the other, and then computing the homology of the resulting complex.\n\nWe will use the free resolution of $M = \\Lambda/(f)$ derived in part (a):\n$$\n\\dots \\to 0 \\to \\Lambda \\xrightarrow{\\mu_f} \\Lambda \\to M \\to 0\n$$\nLet us tensor this resolution with the module $\\Lambda/(T)$ over $\\Lambda$. This yields the complex:\n$$\n\\dots \\to 0 \\to \\Lambda \\otimes_{\\Lambda} (\\Lambda/(T)) \\xrightarrow{\\mu_f \\otimes \\text{id}} \\Lambda \\otimes_{\\Lambda} (\\Lambda/(T)) \\to 0\n$$\nUsing the canonical isomorphism $N \\otimes_{\\Lambda} \\Lambda \\cong N$, which for $N = \\Lambda/(T)$ gives $\\Lambda \\otimes_{\\Lambda} (\\Lambda/(T)) \\cong \\Lambda/(T)$, the complex simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dots \\to 0 \\to \\Lambda/(T) \\xrightarrow{\\overline{\\mu_f}} \\Lambda/(T) \\to 0\n$$\nHere, the map $\\overline{\\mu_f}$ is the map induced by $\\mu_f \\otimes \\text{id}$, which is multiplication by $f$ on the module $\\Lambda/(T)$. Let $C_{\\bullet}$ denote this complex, with $C_1 = \\Lambda/(T)$, $C_0 = \\Lambda/(T)$, and $C_i = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 1$. The differential is $d_1 = \\overline{\\mu_f}$.\n\nBy definition, $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{i}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) = H_i(C_{\\bullet})$. We compute the homology groups:\n\nFor $i=0$:\n$\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{0}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) = H_0(C_{\\bullet}) = C_0 / \\text{im}(d_1) = \\text{coker}(\\overline{\\mu_f})$. This is the cokernel of the map \"multiplication by $f$\" on $\\Lambda/(T)$.\n\nFor $i=1$:\n$\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{1}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) = H_1(C_{\\bullet}) = \\ker(d_1) / \\text{im}(d_2)$. Since $C_2=0$, the map $d_2$ is the zero map, so $\\text{im}(d_2) = 0$. Thus, $H_1(C_{\\bullet}) = \\ker(d_1) = \\ker(\\overline{\\mu_f})$. This is the kernel of the map \"multiplication by $f$\" on $\\Lambda/(T)$.\n\nFor $i \\geq 2$:\nSince $C_i=0$ for all $i \\geq 2$, the homology groups $H_i(C_{\\bullet})$ are all trivial. Thus, $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{i}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) = 0$ for all $i \\ge 2$.\n\nTo be more explicit, we analyze the module $\\Lambda/(T)$. Since $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$, the quotient by the ideal $(T)$ is $\\Lambda/(T) = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]/(T) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p$. The isomorphism sends a power series $g(T) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$ to its constant term $g(0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. The action of multiplication by $f$ on an element $g+(T) \\in \\Lambda/(T)$ is $f \\cdot g + (T)$. Under the isomorphism to $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, this corresponds to multiplication by $f(0)$ on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Let $\\mu_{f(0)}$ be this map. So, we have:\n-  $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{0}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) \\cong \\text{coker}(\\mu_{f(0)}) = \\mathbb{Z}_p / (f(0)\\mathbb{Z}_p)$.\n-  $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{1}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) \\cong \\ker(\\mu_{f(0)})$, which is the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p \\mid f(0) \\cdot x = 0\\}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a domain, this kernel is trivial if $f(0) \\neq 0$, and it is all of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ if $f(0)=0$.\n-  $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{i}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) = 0$ for $i \\ge 2$.\n\nc) We specialize to the case where $p=3$, so $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_3[[T]]$, and the element is $f(T) = 3^5 + 3^2 T + T^3$. We are asked for the cardinality of the abelian group $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{0}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f))$.\n\nFrom part (b), we have the isomorphism:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{0}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 / (f(0)\\mathbb{Z}_3)\n$$\nWe evaluate $f(T)$ at $T=0$ to find its constant term:\n$$\nf(0) = 3^5 + 3^2(0) + (0)^3 = 3^5 = 243\n$$\nThe group is therefore $\\mathbb{Z}_3 / (243\\mathbb{Z}_3)$. Since $243 = 3^5$, this is the group $\\mathbb{Z}_3 / (3^5\\mathbb{Z}_3)$.\n\nThe ideal $3^5\\mathbb{Z}_3$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ consists of all $3$-adic integers divisible by $3^5$. The quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_3 / 3^5\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is known to be isomorphic to the ring of integers modulo $3^5$, $\\mathbb{Z}/3^5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{Z}_3 / (3^5\\mathbb{Z}_3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3^5\\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThe cardinality of this group is the number of elements in it, which is $3^5$.\n$$\n| \\mathbb{Z}/3^5\\mathbb{Z} | = 3^5 = 243\n$$\nTherefore, the exact cardinality of the abelian group $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{0}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f))$ is $243$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{243}\n$$", "id": "3018726"}]}
