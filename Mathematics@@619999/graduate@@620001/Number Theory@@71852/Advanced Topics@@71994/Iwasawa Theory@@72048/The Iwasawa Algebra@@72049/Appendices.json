We will determine its characteristic ideal, Iwasawa invariants, and elementary pseudo-isomorphic decomposition.\n\nFirst, we determine the characteristic ideal of $M$, denoted $\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M)$. By definition, the characteristic ideal of a finitely generated $\\Lambda$-module is its zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M)$. To compute this, we consider a presentation of the module $M$. The module $M = \\Lambda/(p T^{2})$ is a cyclic module, generated by one element (the residue class of $1$) subject to a single relation. This gives the following free presentation of $M$:\n$$ \\Lambda \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\Lambda \\to M \\to 0 $$\nHere, the map $\\phi$ is multiplication by the element $p T^{2}$. In terms of matrices, $M$ is generated by one element, so we have a presentation with a $1 \\times 1$ matrix. The map $\\phi$ is represented by the matrix $A = [p T^{2}]$.\n\nThe zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M)$, is generated by all $1 \\times 1$ minors of the presentation matrix $A$. In this case, there is only one such minor, which is the entry $p T^{2}$ itself. Therefore, the characteristic ideal is the principal ideal generated by this element:\n$$ \\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M) = \\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M) = (p T^{2}) $$\n\nNext, we are asked to find the Iwasawa invariants $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$. These invariants are determined from the unique factorization of a generator of the characteristic ideal, as guaranteed by the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem for the Iwasawa algebra $\\Lambda$. The theorem states that any non-zero element $G(T) \\in \\Lambda$ can be uniquely written as $G(T) = p^{\\mu} f(T) U(T)$, where $\\mu \\geq 0$ is an integer, $f(T)$ is a distinguished polynomial, and $U(T)$ is a unit in $\\Lambda$. A distinguished polynomial is a monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}[T]$ of the form $T^{\\lambda} + a_{\\lambda-1}T^{\\lambda-1} + \\dots + a_{0}$ such that all non-leading coefficients $a_{i}$ are divisible by $p$ (i.e., $a_i \\in p\\mathbb{Z}_p$). The Iwasawa invariants are then defined as $\\mu$ and $\\lambda = \\deg(f(T))$.\n\nThe generator for our characteristic ideal is $G(T) = p T^{2}$. We can write this as:\n$$ G(T) = p^{1} \\cdot T^{2} \\cdot 1 $$\nWe identify the components of this expression with the form from the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem.\nThe power of $p$ is $p^{1}$, so we have $\\mu = 1$.\nThe polynomial part is $f(T) = T^{2}$. To confirm this is a distinguished polynomial, we check its properties. It is a monic polynomial of degree $2$. Its non-leading coefficients are the coefficient of $T^{1}$, which is $0$, and the constant term, which is also $0$. Since $0$ is an element of $p\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, the polynomial $T^{2}$ is indeed a distinguished polynomial.\nThe remaining factor is $U(T) = 1$, which is a unit in $\\Lambda$.\nThus, the factorization $p^{1} \\cdot T^{2}$ is the canonical one. From this, we identify the Iwasawa invariants:\n- The $\\mu$-invariant is the exponent of $p$, so $\\mu = 1$.\n- The $\\lambda$-invariant is the degree of the distinguished polynomial $f(T) = T^{2}$, so $\\lambda = \\deg(T^{2}) = 2$.\nThe ordered pair of invariants is $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, 2)$.\n\nFinally, we identify the elementary pseudo-isomorphic decomposition of $M$. The structure theorem for finitely generated torsion $\\Lambda$-modules states that any such module is pseudo-isomorphic to a direct sum of elementary modules. A pseudo-isomorphism is a $\\Lambda$-module homomorphism with a finite kernel and cokernel. The structure of this direct sum is determined by the characteristic ideal.\n$$ M \\sim \\left( \\bigoplus_{i} \\Lambda/(p^{a_i}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( \\bigoplus_{j} \\Lambda/(g_j(T)^{b_j}) \\right) $$\nwhere each $g_j(T)$ is an irreducible distinguished polynomial. The characteristic ideal of such a direct sum is the principal ideal generated by the product of the individual generators: $\\left( p^{\\sum a_i} \\prod g_j(T)^{b_j} \\right)$.\n\nWe must match this form with our characteristic ideal $\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M) = (p T^{2})$. The generator is $p^{1} T^{2}$.\nThe $p$-power part of the generator is $p^{1}$. This corresponds to a direct summand $\\Lambda/(p^{1}) = \\Lambda/(p)$. Thus, $\\sum a_i = 1$, which implies a single summand with $a_1=1$.\nThe polynomial part of the generator is $T^{2}$. The polynomial $g(T) = T$ is a distinguished polynomial of degree $1$ (it is monic and its constant term is $0 \\in p\\mathbb{Z}_p$) and is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}_p[T]$ as it is of degree $1$. The factorization of the polynomial part is $T^{2} = g(T)^{2}$. This corresponds to a direct summand $\\Lambda/(T^{2})$.\nCombining these, the pseudo-isomorphic decomposition of $M$ is:\n$$ M = \\Lambda/(p T^{2}) \\sim \\Lambda/(p) \\oplus \\Lambda/(T^{2}) $$\n\nThe components of this decomposition are the $p$-power component arising from the $\\mu$-invariant, which is $\\Lambda/(p)$, and the distinguished polynomial component $\\Lambda/(T^2)$, where $T^2$ is the distinguished polynomial factor from which the $\\lambda$-invariant is derived.

We are instructed to use the foundational definitions, including the zeroth Fitting ideal, and to verify the multiplicativity of characteristic ideals for this specific case.\n\nLet us begin by recalling the relevant definitions.

The module $M$ given in the problem satisfies this condition. The characteristic ideal is a principal ideal, and its generator is called a characteristic element, which is well-defined up to multiplication by a unit in $\\Lambda$.\n\nA key property of characteristic ideals, which we are asked to verify, is their multiplicativity over direct sums. For two finitely generated torsion $\\Lambda$-modules $M_1$ and $M_2$, the characteristic ideal of their direct sum is the product of their individual characteristic ideals:\n$$\n\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M_1 \\oplus M_2) = \\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M_1) \\cdot \\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M_2).\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the characteristic ideals of the components of $M$.\nLet $M_1 = \\Lambda/(p)$. This is a cyclic module generated by one element, say $e_1$, subject to the single relation $p \\cdot e_1 = 0$. A presentation for $M_1$ is\n$$\n\\Lambda \\xrightarrow{\\cdot p} \\Lambda \\to M_1 \\to 0.\n$$\nHere, the number of generators is $n=1$. The presentation map is multiplication by $p$, so its matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(p)$. The zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M_1)$, is generated by the $1 \\times 1$ minors of this matrix. The only minor is $p$ itself. Therefore,\n$$\n\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M_1) = \\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M_1) = (p).\n$$\nA generator for this ideal is $p$.\n\nNext, let $M_2 = \\Lambda/(T^{3})$. This is also a cyclic module, generated by one element, say $e_2$, with the relation $T^{3} \\cdot e_2 = 0$. A presentation for $M_2$ is\n$$\n\\Lambda \\xrightarrow{\\cdot T^{3}} \\Lambda \\to M_2 \\to 0.\n$$\nThe presentation matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(T^3)$. The zeroth Fitting ideal is generated by the determinant of this matrix, which is $T^{3}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M_2) = \\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M_2) = (T^{3}).\n$$\nA generator for this ideal is $T^{3}$.\n\nNow, we verify the multiplicativity property.

Thus, $M$ has a set of two generators $\\{m_1, m_2\\}$. The relations these generators satisfy are $p \\cdot m_1 = 0$ and $T^{3} \\cdot m_2 = 0$. We can write these relations in vector form as $p(m_1, m_2) = (0, p \\cdot m_2)$ and $T^3(m_1, m_2) = (T^3 \\cdot m_1, 0)$. This is not a good way to formulate the relations on the generating set.\n\nA correct presentation is constructed as follows. We have a surjective homomorphism $\\psi: \\Lambda^2 \\to M$ sending the standard basis vectors $e_1, e_2$ to the generators $m_1, m_2$ respectively. The kernel of $\\psi$ is generated by the vectors corresponding to the relations. The relations are $p \\cdot m_1 = 0$ and $T^{3} \\cdot m_2 = 0$. Within the free module $\\Lambda^2$, these correspond to the elements $p e_1$ and $T^{3} e_2$. Thus we have the presentation\n$$\n\\Lambda^{2} \\xrightarrow{A} \\Lambda^{2} \\to M \\to 0,\n$$\nwhere the map $A$ sends the standard basis of the leftmost $\\Lambda^{2}$ to the relation vectors $\\{p e_1, T^{3} e_2\\}$ in the middle $\\Lambda^{2}$. The matrix of this map is therefore\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & T^{3} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe module $M$ has $n=2$ generators. The zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M)$, is generated by the $2 \\times 2$ minors of the presentation matrix $A$. The matrix $A$ is itself a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, so there is only one such minor, which is its determinant.\n$$\n\\det(A) = p \\cdot T^{3} - 0 \\cdot 0 = pT^{3}.\n$$\nThus, the zeroth Fitting ideal is the principal ideal generated by $pT^{3}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M) = (pT^{3}).\n$$\nBy definition, this is the characteristic ideal of $M$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M) = (pT^{3}).\n$$\nThis direct computation confirms the result obtained by applying the multiplicativity property.
