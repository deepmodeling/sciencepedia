The derivation will be presented in two parts. First, we compute the value of $\\Phi_{p^{n}}(1)$. Second, we demonstrate its identity with the given norm.\n\nPart 1: Evaluation of $\\Phi_{p^{n}}(1)$\n\nThe cyclotomic polynomials $\\Phi_d(X)$ are defined by the factorization of $X^m - 1$ over the integers for any $m \\geq 1$:\n$$X^m - 1 = \\prod_{d | m} \\Phi_d(X)$$\nLet us set $m = p^n$. The divisors of $p^n$ are $1, p, p^2, \\dots, p^n$. Thus, we have:\n$$X^{p^n} - 1 = \\prod_{j=0}^{n} \\Phi_{p^j}(X) = \\Phi_{p^n}(X) \\left( \\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} \\Phi_{p^j}(X) \\right)$$\nRecognizing that the product in the parenthesis corresponds to the factorization of $X^{p^{n-1}} - 1$, we can write:\n$$X^{p^n} - 1 = \\Phi_{p^n}(X) (X^{p^{n-1}} - 1)$$\nThis gives us a formula for the $p^n$-th cyclotomic polynomial for $n \\geq 1$:\n$$\\Phi_{p^n}(X) = \\frac{X^{p^n} - 1}{X^{p^{n-1}} - 1}$$\nFor the special case $n = 1$, this formula yields $\\Phi_p(X) = \\frac{X^p - 1}{X-1} = 1 + X + X^2 + \\dots + X^{p-1}$.\n\nTo find the value of $\\Phi_{p^n}(1)$, we cannot simply substitute $X=1$ into the fractional form, as this results in the indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$. Instead, we must evaluate the limit as $X \\to 1$. We can use L'Hôpital's Rule. Let $f(X) = X^{p^n} - 1$ and $g(X) = X^{p^{n-1}} - 1$. Their derivatives are $f'(X) = p^n X^{p^n-1}$ and $g'(X) = p^{n-1} X^{p^{n-1}-1}$.\nThe value $\\Phi_{p^n}(1)$ is given by the limit:\n$$\\Phi_{p^n}(1) = \\lim_{X \\to 1} \\frac{X^{p^n} - 1}{X^{p^{n-1}} - 1} = \\lim_{X \\to 1} \\frac{p^n X^{p^n - 1}}{p^{n-1} X^{p^{n-1} - 1}}$$\nEvaluating the limit by substituting $X=1$:\n$$\\Phi_{p^n}(1) = \\frac{p^n \\cdot 1^{p^n - 1}}{p^{n-1} \\cdot 1^{p^{n-1} - 1}} = \\frac{p^n}{p^{n-1}} = p$$\nThus, the integer value of $\\Phi_{p^n}(1)$ is $p$.\n\nPart 2: Justification of the Coincidence with the Norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_{p^{n}})$\n\nThe cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_{p^n}(X)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_{p^n}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its roots are the set of all primitive $p^n$-th roots of unity. These roots are of the form $\\zeta_{p^n}^a$, where $a$ is an integer coprime to $p^n$, and we can take $a$ from the set of representatives $\\{a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 1 \\le a \\le p^n, \\gcd(a, p^n) = 1\\}$. This set of representatives corresponds to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z})^*$.\nTherefore, $\\Phi_{p^n}(X)$ can be written as a product of its linear factors:\n$$\\Phi_{p^n}(X) = \\prod_{a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z})^*} (X - \\zeta_{p^n}^a)$$\nSubstituting $X=1$ into this expression, we get:\n$$\\Phi_{p^n}(1) = \\prod_{a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z})^*} (1 - \\zeta_{p^n}^a)$$\n\nNow, let's consider the norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_{p^n})$. The field extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{p^n})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(\\Phi_{p^n}(X)) = \\phi(p^n)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function. The Galois group, $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, consists of $\\phi(p^n)$ distinct automorphisms of $K$ that fix $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThese automorphisms, let's call them $\\sigma_a$, are uniquely determined by their action on the generator $\\zeta_{p^n}$. For each $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z})^*$, there is a unique automorphism $\\sigma_a \\in G$ such that $\\sigma_a(\\zeta_{p^n}) = \\zeta_{p^n}^a$. The set of all such $\\sigma_a$ constitutes the entire Galois group $G$.\n\nThe norm of an element $\\alpha \\in K$ is defined as the product of all its Galois conjugates:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\prod_{\\sigma \\in G} \\sigma(\\alpha)$$\nLet's compute the norm for $\\alpha = 1 - \\zeta_{p^n}$:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_{p^n}) = \\prod_{a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z})^*} \\sigma_a(1 - \\zeta_{p^n})$$\nSince automorphisms fix the elements of $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\sigma_a(1) = 1$. The action on $\\zeta_{p^n}$ is $\\sigma_a(\\zeta_{p^n}) = \\zeta_{p^n}^a$. Thus:\n$$\\sigma_a(1 - \\zeta_{p^n}) = \\sigma_a(1) - \\sigma_a(\\zeta_{p^n}) = 1 - \\zeta_{p^n}^a$$\nSubstituting this back into the norm expression:\n$$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_{p^n}) = \\prod_{a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z})^*} (1 - \\zeta_{p^n}^a)$$\n\nComparing this result with our expression for $\\Phi_{p^n}(1)$ from the factorization of the polynomial, we see they are identical:\n$$\\Phi_{p^n}(1) = \\prod_{a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z})^*} (1 - \\zeta_{p^n}^a) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_{p^n})$$\nThis completes the justification.\n\nCombining the results of both parts, we have established that $\\Phi_{p^n}(1) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_{p^n})$, and the exact integer value of these expressions is $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p}$$", "id": "3020409"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the behavior of the prime $p$, we now turn our attention to how other primes $\\ell$ behave in cyclotomic extensions.

The problem is self-contained, unambiguous, and admits a unique, well-defined solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_{15})$ be the cyclotomic field of $15$-th roots of unity. The Galois group of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of integers modulo $15$, as stated in the problem:\n$$G = \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$$\nThe order of this group is given by Euler's totient function:\n$$|G| = \\phi(15) = \\phi(3)\\phi(5) = (3-1)(5-1) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$$\nThe isomorphism maps a residue class $k \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ to an automorphism $\\sigma_k \\in G$ defined by its action on any $15$-th root of unity $\\zeta \\in \\mu_{15}$ as $\\sigma_k(\\zeta) = \\zeta^k$.\n\nThe problem considers the rational prime $\\ell = 11$. Since $11$ does not divide $15$, the prime is unramified in $K$. The Frobenius element at $\\ell=11$, denoted $\\sigma_{11}$, corresponds to the residue class of $11$ modulo $15$. This automorphism is an element of the Galois group $G$.\n\nThe decomposition group of the prime $\\ell=11$ in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the subgroup of $G$ generated by the Frobenius element. Since $G$ is abelian, this group is uniquely defined and we denote it by $D_{11}$:\n$$D_{11} = \\langle \\sigma_{11} \\rangle$$\nTo determine this subgroup, we must find the order of the element $\\sigma_{11}$ in $G$. This is equivalent to finding the multiplicative order of $11$ in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. We compute the powers of $11$ modulo $15$:\n$$11^1 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{15}$$\n$$11^2 = 121 = 8 \\times 15 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15}$$\nThe order of $11$ modulo $15$ is $2$. Thus, the decomposition group is a cyclic group of order $2$:\n$$D_{11} = \\{\\sigma_1, \\sigma_{11}\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$$\nwhere $\\sigma_1$ is the identity automorphism.\n\nThe decomposition field, which we denote $F$, is the fixed field of the decomposition group $D_{11}$. By definition:\n$$F = K^{D_{11}} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_{15})^{\\langle \\sigma_{11} \\rangle}$$\nTo identify this field explicitly, we analyze the structure of the Galois group $G$ using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n$$(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$$\nThe cyclotomic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_{15})$ is the compositum of the fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$, i.e., $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3)\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$. An automorphism $\\sigma_k \\in G$ acts on $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3)$ as $\\sigma_{k \\pmod 3}$ and on $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$ as $\\sigma_{k \\pmod 5}$.\nThe Frobenius element $\\sigma_{11}$ corresponds to the pair $(11 \\pmod 3, 11 \\pmod 5) = (2, 1)$.\nThe action of $\\sigma_{11}$ on an element $\\zeta_3 \\in \\mu_3$ is $\\sigma_{11}(\\zeta_3) = \\zeta_3^{11} = \\zeta_3^2 = \\bar{\\zeta_3}$. This is the non-trivial automorphism of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3)/\\mathbb{Q}$ (complex conjugation).\nThe action of $\\sigma_{11}$ on an element $\\zeta_5 \\in \\mu_5$ is $\\sigma_{11}(\\zeta_5) = \\zeta_5^{11} = \\zeta_5^1 = \\zeta_5$. This is the trivial automorphism of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the automorphism $\\sigma_{11}$ acts as the identity on the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$, but non-trivially on $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3)$. The fixed field $F = K^{\\langle \\sigma_{11} \\rangle}$ must therefore contain $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$. The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)(\\mu_3)/\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$, which has degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3):\\mathbb{Q}]=2$. The automorphism group $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5))$ is generated by $\\sigma_{11}$ (restricted to $K$). Since $\\sigma_{11}$ is non-trivial on this extension, the only elements of $K$ fixed by $\\sigma_{11}$ are the elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$.\nTherefore, the decomposition field is precisely $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_5)$.\nThis field corresponds to the divisor $d=5$ of $m=15$. The primes that split completely in this field are those satisfying the congruence $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.

Therefore,\n$$[F:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.

The polynomial in question is $f(X) = X^{p-1}-1 = X^{12}-1$, considered as a polynomial with coefficients in the ring of $13$-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$. We are given an integer $g=2$, which represents an element in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$.\n\n**Part 1: Existence, Uniqueness, and Primitivity of the Root $\\zeta$**\n\nWe are asked to justify the existence of a unique $\\zeta \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{13}$ such that $\\zeta^{12}=1$ and $\\zeta \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$. This is a direct application of Hensel's Lemma, as stated in the problem (Fact (ii)).\n\nLet the initial approximation be $x_0 = 2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{13}$. We must verify the two conditions for Hensel's Lemma.\n1.  $f(x_0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$:\n    We calculate $f(2) = 2^{12}-1$. By Fermat's Little Theorem (Fact (i)), for any integer $a$ not divisible by a prime $p$, we have $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Here, $p=13$ and $a=2$. Since $13 \\nmid 2$, we have $2^{13-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, which is $2^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. Therefore, $f(2) = 2^{12}-1 \\equiv 1-1 = 0 \\pmod{13}$. This condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  $f'(x_0) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$:\n    The formal derivative of $f(X)$ is $f'(X) = 12X^{11}$. Evaluating at $x_0=2$, we get $f'(2) = 12 \\cdot 2^{11}$. Reducing this modulo $13$, we find $f'(2) \\equiv (13-1) \\cdot 2^{11} \\equiv -1 \\cdot 2^{11} \\pmod{13}$. Since $13$ is prime and does not divide $2$, $2^{11}$ is not congruent to $0$ modulo $13$. Thus, $f'(2) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$. This condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions of Hensel's Lemma are met, we conclude that there exists a unique root $\\zeta \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ of the polynomial $f(X)$ such that $\\zeta \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{13}$. That is, there is a unique $\\zeta \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ satisfying $\\zeta^{12}=1$ and $\\zeta \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ is a subring of $\\mathbb{Q}_{13}$, this establishes the existence and uniqueness of such a $\\zeta$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_{13}$.\n\nNext, we explain why this $\\zeta$ is a primitive $12$-th root of unity. A root of unity is primitive of order $12$ if it is a $12$-th root of unity, but not a $k$-th root of unity for any proper positive divisor $k$ of $12$. The proper divisors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\zeta$ is not a primitive $12$-th root of unity. Then $\\zeta^k = 1$ for some $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}$.\nIf we reduce the equation $\\zeta^k=1$ modulo $13$, we obtain $(\\zeta \\pmod{13})^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nGiven that $\\zeta \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$, this implies $2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nThis would mean that the multiplicative order of $2$ in the group $\\mathbb{F}_{13}^{\\times}$ must divide $k$. As $k$ is a proper divisor of $12$, the order of $2$ would be strictly less than $12$.\nLet's compute the powers of $2$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$ to find its order.\n$2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^6 = (2^3)^2 \\equiv 8^2 = 64 \\equiv 12 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$\nSince none of these powers are congruent to $1 \\pmod{13}$, the order of $2$ cannot be $1, 2, 3, 4,$ or $6$. The order of any element in $\\mathbb{F}_{13}^{\\times}$ must divide the order of the group, which is $12$. Since we have excluded all proper divisors of $12$, the order of $2$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{13}^{\\times}$ must be exactly $12$. This means $g=2$ is a generator of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{F}_{13}^{\\times}$ (Fact (iii)).\nThis creates a contradiction with our earlier deduction that the order must be a proper divisor of $12$. Therefore, our initial assumption was false. $\\zeta$ cannot satisfy $\\zeta^k=1$ for any proper divisor $k$ of $12$.\nWe conclude that $\\zeta$ is a primitive $12$-th root of unity.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of a Limit Expression for $\\zeta$**\n\nWe are asked to derive a limit expression for $\\zeta$ using the map $h(X) = X^{13}$. We consider the sequence $\\{x_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0}$ defined by $x_0 = 2$ and $x_{n+1} = h(x_n) = x_n^{13}$ for $n \\ge 0$. The terms of this sequence are $x_0=2$, $x_1=2^{13}$, $x_2=(2^{13})^{13}=2^{13^2}$, and in general, $x_n = 2^{13^n}$.\n\nWe will show that the map $h(X)$ is a contraction on the set $S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{13} \\mid x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}\\}$.\nThe set $S$ is the closed ball $2+13\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ is a complete metric space with respect to the $13$-adic metric, $S$ is also a complete metric space.\n\nFirst, we show that $h$ maps $S$ into itself. If $x \\in S$, then $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$. Then $h(x) = x^{13} \\equiv 2^{13} = 2 \\cdot 2^{12} \\pmod{13}$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, so $h(x) \\equiv 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\pmod{13}$. This shows $h(x) \\in S$.\n\nNext, we show that $h$ is a strict contraction on $S$. Let $x, y \\in S$. We examine the distance $|h(x) - h(y)|_{13}$.\n$h(x) - h(y) = x^{13} - y^{13} = (x-y) \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{12} x^{12-i} y^i \\right)$.\nTaking the $13$-adic absolute value, we get:\n$|h(x) - h(y)|_{13} = |x-y|_{13} \\left| \\sum_{i=0}^{12} x^{12-i} y^i \\right|_{13}$.\nSince $x, y \\in S$, we have $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$ and $y \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$. Thus, for each term in the sum, $x^{12-i} y^i \\equiv 2^{12-i} 2^i = 2^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nThe sum itself is then congruent to $\\sum_{i=0}^{12} 1 = 13 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$.\nThis means the sum is a multiple of $13$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$, so its $13$-adic valuation is at least $1$. Consequently, its $13$-adic absolute value is at most $13^{-1}$:\n$\\left| \\sum_{i=0}^{12} x^{12-i} y^i \\right|_{13} \\le \\frac{1}{13}$.\nThis gives the inequality:\n$|h(x) - h(y)|_{13} \\le \\frac{1}{13} |x-y|_{13}$.\nSince the factor $\\frac{1}{13}$ is less than $1$, the map $h$ is a strict contraction on the complete metric space $S$.\n\nBy the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, there exists a unique fixed point $\\omega \\in S$ such that $h(\\omega) = \\omega$, and this fixed point is the limit of the sequence $x_{n+1} = h(x_n)$ for any starting point $x_0 \\in S$.\nThe fixed-point equation is $\\omega^{13} = \\omega$, which can be rewritten as $\\omega(\\omega^{12}-1) = 0$.\nSince the fixed point $\\omega$ lies in $S$, it must satisfy $\\omega \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$. This implies $\\omega \\neq 0$.\nTherefore, the fixed point must satisfy $\\omega^{12}-1 = 0$.\nSo, $\\omega$ is a $12$-th root of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ that is congruent to $2$ modulo $13$. From Part 1, we know there is exactly one such element, namely $\\zeta$. Thus, $\\omega = \\zeta$.\n\nThe limit of the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ starting with $x_0=2$ is precisely this fixed point $\\zeta$. The sequence is given by $x_n = 2^{13^n}$.\nTherefore, the concrete limit expression for the primitive $12$-th root of unity $\\zeta$ is:\n$\\zeta = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 2^{13^n}$.\nThis number is the Teichmüller representative of the residue class $2 \\pmod{13}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 2^{13^n}}\n$$", "id": "3020328"}]}
