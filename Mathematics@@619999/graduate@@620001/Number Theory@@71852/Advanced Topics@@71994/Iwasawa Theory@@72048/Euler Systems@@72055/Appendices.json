It also asks for an explanation of why this dimension coincides with the count of negative Hodge–Tate weights.\n\nFirst, we must clarify the specific cohomology group in question. While the problem denotes it as $H^1(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$, the context of \"Euler systems and Bloch–Kato local conditions\" and the specific hint that the answer should coincide with the count of negative Hodge-Tate weights strongly suggest that the relevant group is the Bloch-Kato \"finite\" (or crystalline) cohomology group, denoted $H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$. This group represents the local condition imposed at $p$ in the definition of the Bloch-Kato Selmer group. Under this interpretation, the problem becomes coherent and solvable with the given information.\n\nThe dimension of $H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$ for a crystalline representation $V$ is given by a fundamental formula of Bloch and Kato:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} (D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V))\n$$\nWe will now compute each of the two terms on the right-hand side using the data provided in the problem.\n\n1.  **Computation of $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$**:\n    The group $H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$ consists of the elements of $V$ that are fixed by the action of $G_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$. For a crystalline representation $V$, there is a canonical isomorphism:\n    $$\n    H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V) \\cong D_{\\mathrm{cris}}(V)^{\\varphi=1}\n    $$\n    where $D_{\\mathrm{cris}}(V)^{\\varphi=1}$ is the eigenspace of the Frobenius endomorphism $\\varphi$ on the Dieudonné module $D_{\\mathrm{cris}}(V)$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$.\n    The problem statement specifies that the eigenvalues of $\\varphi$, denoted $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, satisfy $\\alpha_i \\neq 1$ for all $i$. This is one of the \"Frobenius genericity hypotheses\". Consequently, the eigenspace for the eigenvalue $1$ is trivial.\n    Therefore, we have:\n    $$\n    \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} (D_{\\mathrm{cris}}(V)^{\\varphi=1}) = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Computation of $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} (D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V))$**:\n    The de Rham module $D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)$ is equipped with the decreasing Hodge filtration $\\{\\mathrm{Fil}^i D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$. The dimension of the quotient space $D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)$ is given by:\n    $$\n    \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} (D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)\n    $$\n    The dimension of $D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)$ is equal to the dimension of $V$, which is given as $4$. So, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = 4$.\n    The dimension of the filtered subspace $\\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)$ can be calculated from the Hodge–Tate weights. The Hodge–Tate weights are the integers $j$ for which the graded pieces $\\operatorname{gr}^j D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = \\mathrm{Fil}^j D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^{j+1} D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)$ are non-zero. The dimension of the filtration at level $i$ is the sum of the dimensions of the graded pieces for indices greater than or equal to $i$:\n    $$\n    \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\mathrm{Fil}^i D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = \\sum_{j \\ge i} \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\operatorname{gr}^j D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)\n    $$\n    The problem states that the Hodge–Tate weights of $V$ are exactly $\\{-3, -1, 0, 2\\}$, each with multiplicity $1$. This means $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\operatorname{gr}^j D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = 1$ for $j \\in \\{-3, -1, 0, 2\\}$ and is $0$ otherwise.\n    To find $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)$, we sum the dimensions of the graded pieces for all non-negative weights:\n    $$\n    \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = \\sum_{j \\ge 0} \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\operatorname{gr}^j D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\operatorname{gr}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\operatorname{gr}^2 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = 1 + 1 = 2\n    $$\n    Thus, the dimension of the quotient is:\n    $$\n    \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} (D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)) = 4 - 2 = 2\n    $$\n    Note that this dimension, $\\dim(D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)) = \\sum_{j<0} \\dim \\operatorname{gr}^j D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V)$, is precisely the number of negative Hodge–Tate weights, counted with multiplicity. The negative weights are $\\{-3, -1\\}$, so this count is $1+1=2$.\n\n**Conclusion and Explanation**:\nSubstituting the results from steps 1 and 2 into the Bloch-Kato formula:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V) = 0 + 2 = 2\n$$\nThe dimension of the local cohomology group $H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$ is $2$.\n\nThis dimension coincides with the count of negative Hodge–Tate weights. The explanation is now clear from the structure of the Bloch-Kato formula. The dimension of $H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$ is the sum of two terms. The first term, $\\dim H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$, vanishes due to the \"Frobenius genericity hypothesis\" that $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $\\varphi$. The second term, $\\dim(D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) / \\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V))$, is by definition the sum of the multiplicities of the negative Hodge–Tate weights. Therefore, under the given hypothesis that $H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)=0$, the dimension of $H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, V)$ is necessarily equal to the count of negative Hodge–Tate weights.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3013771"}, {"introduction": "An Euler system is a global construction, but its defining norm-compatibility relations are dictated by local Euler factors at each prime.

The problem is well-posed and all the premises are standard results in the theory of modular forms and Galois representations.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $P_{\\ell}(X)$\n\nThe local Euler factor polynomial at the prime $\\ell$ is defined as\n$$\nP_{\\ell}(X) \\coloneqq \\det\\!\\bigl(1 - \\operatorname{Frob}_{\\ell}^{-1}\\, X \\,\\big|\\, V_f^{I_{\\ell}} \\bigr)\n$$\nwhere $V_f = T_f \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p$ is the $p$-adic Galois representation attached to the newform $f$, $I_{\\ell}$ is the inertia subgroup of the decomposition group $G_{\\ell} = \\operatorname{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\ell}/\\mathbb{Q}_{\\ell})$, and $V_f^{I_{\\ell}}$ is the subspace of $V_f$ consisting of vectors fixed by every element of $I_{\\ell}$. $\\operatorname{Frob}_{\\ell}$ is a geometric Frobenius element, and thus $\\operatorname{Frob}_{\\ell}^{-1}$ is an arithmetic Frobenius element, which we will denote by $\\phi_{\\ell}$.\n\nThe problem states that the local representation $V_f|_{G_\\ell}$ is of Steinberg type. For a weight $2$ newform with trivial nebentypus, the structure of such a representation is well-known. It is a non-split, two-dimensional representation of $G_{\\ell}$ that fits into a short exact sequence:\n$$\n0 \\to \\mathcal{V}_1 \\to V_f|_{G_{\\ell}} \\to \\mathcal{V}_2 \\to 0\n$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{V}_1$ and $\\mathcal{V}_2$ are one-dimensional representations (characters) of $G_{\\ell}$. For the overall representation to have the correct determinant, namely the $p$-adic cyclotomic character $\\chi_{cyc}$ (since the weight is $k=2$ and the nebentypus is trivial), and for it to be of Steinberg type, the characters must be related.\n\nSpecifically, $\\mathcal{V}_2$ must be an unramified character, meaning it is trivial on the inertia subgroup $I_{\\ell}$. Let us denote this unramified character by $\\chi_{\\text{unr}}$. The sub-representation $\\mathcal{V}_1$ is then necessarily ramified and is given by $\\mathcal{V}_1 = \\chi_{\\text{unr}} \\otimes \\chi_{cyc}$. The determinant of the semi-simplification is $(\\chi_{\\text{unr}}) \\cdot (\\chi_{\\text{unr}} \\otimes \\chi_{cyc}) = \\chi_{\\text{unr}}^2 \\otimes \\chi_{cyc}$. For this to equal $\\chi_{cyc}$, the character $\\chi_{\\text{unr}}^2$ must be trivial. This means $\\chi_{\\text{unr}}$ is a character of order at most $2$, so its values on Frobenius are $\\pm 1$.\n\nThe subspace of inertia invariants, $V_f^{I_{\\ell}}$, consists of vectors in $V_f$ that are fixed by the action of $I_{\\ell}$. In the sequence above, $I_{\\ell}$ acts trivially on the quotient $\\mathcal{V}_2$ (as it is unramified) but acts non-trivially on the subobject $\\mathcal{V}_1$ (via the cyclotomic character $\\chi_{cyc}$, which is ramified). Because the extension is non-split, the only vectors fixed by all of $I_{\\ell}$ are those that map to $0$ in $\\mathcal{V}_1$ under a suitable filtration, which correspond to the space $\\mathcal{V}_2$. Therefore, the space of inertia invariants $V_f^{I_{\\ell}}$ is precisely the one-dimensional space on which $G_{\\ell}$ acts via the character $\\chi_{\\text{unr}}$. This is consistent with the problem's hint that $V_f^{I_{\\ell}}$ is one-dimensional.\n\nThe arithmetic Frobenius $\\phi_{\\ell}$ acts on this one-dimensional space $V_f^{I_{\\ell}}$ as multiplication by the scalar $\\chi_{\\text{unr}}(\\phi_{\\ell})$. By the fundamental results of Deligne and others on the correspondence between modular forms and Galois representations, the eigenvalue of the arithmetic Frobenius on the maximal unramified quotient of the local representation at a prime $\\ell$ dividing the level is precisely the $U_{\\ell}$-eigenvalue of the newform $f$, which is denoted by $a_{\\ell}$.\nThus, we have $\\chi_{\\text{unr}}(\\phi_{\\ell}) = a_{\\ell}$. The problem statement gives that for a weight $2$ newform on a squarefree level $N$, $a_{\\ell} \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$, which is consistent with our finding that $\\chi_{\\text{unr}}$ is a quadratic character.\n\nNow we can compute $P_{\\ell}(X)$. Since $V_f^{I_{\\ell}}$ is a one-dimensional space, and the arithmetic Frobenius $\\phi_{\\ell} = \\operatorname{Frob}_{\\ell}^{-1}$ acts on it by multiplication by $a_{\\ell}$, the operator is simply the scalar $a_{\\ell}$.\nSo, $P_{\\ell}(X)$ is the determinant of the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[1 - a_{\\ell}X]$:\n$$\nP_{\\ell}(X) = \\det(1 - a_{\\ell}X) = 1 - a_{\\ell}X\n$$\n\nPart 2: Euler System Norm Relations and Admissibility\n\nAn Euler system for $T_f$ over the cyclotomic tower of fields is a family of cohomology classes $z_m \\in H^1(\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_m), T_f)$ for squarefree integers $m$, compatible under norm maps. The core norm relation for a prime $r$ is given by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{cores}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_m)}^{\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_{mr})}(z_{mr}) = P_r(\\operatorname{Frob}_r^{-1}) z_m\n$$\nwhere $P_r(X) = \\det(1 - \\operatorname{Frob}_r^{-1}X | T_f^{I_r})$.\n\nThe expression for $P_r(X)$ depends on the nature of the prime $r$.\n\nCase 1: Good prime $r$ ($r \\nmid Np$). At such a prime, the representation $T_f$ is unramified, so the inertia group $I_r$ acts trivially on the entire space $T_f$. Thus, $T_f^{I_r} = T_f$, which is a rank-$2$ module. The Euler factor is the characteristic polynomial of $\\operatorname{Frob}_r^{-1}$ on $T_f$:\n$$\nP_r(X) = \\det(1 - \\operatorname{Frob}_r^{-1}X | T_f) = 1 - a_rX + r X^2\n$$\nwhere $a_r$ is the Hecke eigenvalue for $f$ at $r$. The norm relation is quadratic in the Frobenius operator.\n\nCase 2: Bad prime $\\ell$ of Steinberg type ($\\ell | N$, $\\ell \\neq p$). As we derived in Part 1, the space of inertia invariants $T_f^{I_\\ell}$ is one-dimensional, and the Euler factor is linear:\n$$\nP_{\\ell}(X) = 1 - a_{\\ell}X\n$$\nThe norm relation at $\\ell$ is therefore qualitatively different:\n$$\n\\operatorname{cores}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_m)}^{\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_{m\\ell})}(z_{m\\ell}) = (1 - a_{\\ell}\\operatorname{Frob}_{\\ell}^{-1})z_m\n$$\n\nThis modification has significant consequences for the theory and its applications. The \"admissibility\" of an Euler system, a concept essential for using the system to bound Selmer groups, often refers to local non-vanishing properties of the cohomology classes. In the theory of Bloch and Kato, local conditions at each prime are used to define the Selmer group. At a prime $\\ell$ where the representation is Steinberg, the \"finite\" local condition is imposed by considering the unramified cohomology $H_f^1(G_\\ell, T_f) = H^1(G_\\ell/I_\\ell, T_f^{I_\\ell})$. The factor $P_\\ell(\\operatorname{Frob}_\\ell^{-1})$ is precisely the operator that governs the behavior of unramified classes. The fact that this operator is a simple, invertible polynomial (since $a_\\ell = \\pm 1$) makes the analysis of the Euler system at Steinberg primes particularly clean compared to other types of bad reduction. This explicit form of the norm relation is a key input in the formulas of Kato and Perrin-Riou that relate Euler system classes to special values (or derivatives) of $p$-adic $L$-functions, which lies at the heart of proving cases of the Bloch-Kato conjecture for modular forms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - a_{\\ell}X}$$", "id": "3013723"}, {"introduction": "The profound connection between Euler systems and $p$-adic $L$-functions can be subtle, especially in the presence of \"exceptional zeros\" where the $p$-adic $L$-function vanishes for reasons unrelated to global arithmetic.
