The answer is exact and requires no rounding.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the dimensions of the spaces of modular forms, $\\dim M_{k}$, and cusp forms, $\\dim S_{k}$, for the special linear group $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ for all even weights $k$ such that $0 \\le k \\le 30$. The derivation must rely solely on the provided facts: the structure of the graded algebra of modular forms $M_{\\ast} = \\mathbb{C}[E_{4}, E_{6}]$ and the properties of the Ramanujan delta-function $\\Delta$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dimension of $M_{k}$. The statement that $M_{\\ast} = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 0} M_{k}$ is a polynomial algebra $\\mathbb{C}[E_{4}, E_{6}]$ with grading by weight means that for any even weight $k$, the vector space $M_{k}$ consists of all weighted-homogeneous polynomials in $E_{4}$ and $E_{6}$ of total weight $k$. The weights of the generators are given as $\\deg(E_{4}) = 4$ and $\\deg(E_{6}) = 6$. Since $E_{4}$ and $E_{6}$ are algebraically independent, the set of distinct monomials of the form $E_{4}^{a}E_{6}^{b}$ constitutes a basis for the algebra $M_{\\ast}$. A monomial $E_{4}^{a}E_{6}^{b}$ belongs to $M_{k}$ if and only if its total weight is $k$. The weight of such a monomial is $4a + 6b$. Therefore, a basis for $M_{k}$ is given by the set of all monomials $\\{E_{4}^{a}E_{6}^{b}\\}$ where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers satisfying the linear Diophantine equation:\n$$4a + 6b = k$$\nThe dimension of $M_{k}$, $\\dim M_{k}$, is therefore equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions $(a, b)$ to this equation. Since $k$ is an even integer, we can divide by $2$ to simplify the equation to:\n$$2a + 3b = \\frac{k}{2}$$\n\nNext, we determine the dimension of the subspace of cusp forms $S_{k}$. We are given that $\\Delta$ is a cusp form of weight $12$. This means that multiplication by $\\Delta$ defines a linear map from $M_{k-12}$ to $S_{k}$, given by $f \\mapsto f \\cdot \\Delta$.\nLet's verify this map is an isomorphism.\n$1$. For any $f \\in M_{k-12}$, the product $f \\cdot \\Delta$ is a modular form of weight $(k-12) + 12 = k$. Since $\\Delta$ is a cusp form, it vanishes at the cusp at infinity. Consequently, the product $f \\cdot \\Delta$ also vanishes at the cusp, which implies $f \\cdot \\Delta \\in S_{k}$. Thus, the map is well-defined.\n$2$. The map is injective. Suppose $f \\cdot \\Delta = 0$. The problem states that $\\Delta$ has no zeros in the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$. For the product $f(z)\\Delta(z)$ to be zero for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, $f(z)$ must be zero for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, which means $f$ is the zero form.\n$3$. The map is surjective. Let $g \\in S_{k}$. Since $g$ is a cusp form, it vanishes at the cusp. We are given that $\\Delta$ vanishes to order $1$ at the cusp. Therefore, the function $f = g/\\Delta$ is holomorphic at the cusp. As $\\Delta$ has no zeros in $\\mathbb{H}$, $f$ is also holomorphic on $\\mathbb{H}$. The transformation properties of modular forms imply that $f$ is a modular form of weight $k-12$. Thus, $f \\in M_{k-12}$, and $g = f \\cdot \\Delta$.\nThis establishes a vector space isomorphism $M_{k-12} \\cong S_{k}$. Consequently, their dimensions are equal:\n$$\\dim S_{k} = \\dim M_{k-12}$$\nThis relation holds for $k \\ge 12$. For $k < 12$, any non-zero element of $M_k$ must be a polynomial in $E_4$ and $E_6$. As shown in the validation step, any such non-zero element for $k \\in \\{4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ does not vanish at the cusp, so it is not a cusp form. For $k<4$ (and $k$ even, non-negative), $M_k$ contains only constants ($k=0$) or is trivial ($k=2$). Therefore, $S_k = \\{0\\}$ for $k<12$, which implies $\\dim S_k = 0$ for $k < 12$.\n\nWe now compute the dimensions for the specified range of weights.\n\nCalculation of $\\dim M_{k}$ for $k = 0, 2, \\dots, 30$.

An elliptic point of order $m$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ corresponds to a $\\Gamma_0(N)$-conjugacy class of elements of order $2m$ in $\\Gamma_0(N)$. Their existence is governed by number-theoretic conditions on $N$. We use established formulas for these quantities.\n    \n    The number of elliptic points of order $2$, $e_2(N)$, for $N>1$ is given by:\n    $$e_2(N) = \\begin{cases} \\prod_{p|N} (1 + (\\frac{-1}{p})) & \\text{if } 4 \\nmid N \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } 4|N \\end{cases}$$\n    where $(\\frac{a}{p})$ is the Legendre symbol. For $N=24$, we have $4|24$. Therefore, $e_2(24) = 0$.\n\n    The number of elliptic points of order $3$, $e_3(N)$, for $N>2$ is given by:\n    $$e_3(N) = \\begin{cases} \\prod_{p|N} (1 + (\\frac{-3}{p})) & \\text{if } 9 \\nmid N \\text{ and for all primes } p|N, p \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n    For $N=24$, the prime divisors are $2$ and $3$. Since $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, the condition for a non-zero value is not met.

The genus is calculated using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula applied to the covering $X_0(N) \\to X(1) \\cong \\mathbb{P}^1$:\n    $$g_0(N) = 1 + \\frac{\\mu_0(N)}{12} - \\frac{e_2(N)}{4} - \\frac{e_3(N)}{3} - \\frac{c_0(N)}{2}$$\n    where $\\mu_0(N) = [\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + 1/p)$.\n    For $N=24$:\n    $$\\mu_0(24) = 24 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 24 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 48$$\n    Substituting the values for the invariants:\n    $$g_0(24) = 1 + \\frac{48}{12} - \\frac{0}{4} - \\frac{0}{3} - \\frac{8}{2} = 1 + 4 - 0 - 0 - 4 = 1$$\n    So, the genus of $X_0(24)$ is $g_0(24) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Dimension Formulas for $M_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$ and $S_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$**\n    The dimensions of the spaces of modular forms and cusp forms are direct applications of the Riemann-Roch theorem.

The relation is $g = f * \\tau$, where $(f * \\tau)(N) = \\sum_{d|N} f(d)\\tau(N/d)$.\n\nTo derive the inversion procedure, we must express $f$ in terms of $g$. This requires finding the Dirichlet inverse of the divisor function $\\tau$. The divisor function itself is a convolution of the constant function $\\mathbf{1}(n)=1$ with itself: $\\tau = \\mathbf{1} * \\mathbf{1}$. The Dirichlet inverse of $\\mathbf{1}$ is the Möbius function $\\mu$, i.e., $\\mathbf{1}^{-1} = \\mu$. The inverse of a convolution is the convolution of the inverses, so:\n$$\\tau^{-1} = (\\mathbf{1} * \\mathbf{1})^{-1} = \\mathbf{1}^{-1} * \\mathbf{1}^{-1} = \\mu * \\mu$$\nNow, we can solve for $f$ by convolving both sides of $g=f*\\tau$ with $\\tau^{-1}$:\n$$g * \\tau^{-1} = (f * \\tau) * \\tau^{-1} = f * (\\tau * \\tau^{-1}) = f * \\epsilon = f$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the identity element for Dirichlet convolution, $\\epsilon(1)=1$ and $\\epsilon(n)=0$ for $n>1$.\nThus, the inversion formula is:\n$$f(N) = (g * \\tau^{-1})(N) = \\sum_{d|N} g(d) \\tau^{-1}\\left(\\frac{N}{d}\\right) = \\sum_{d|N} s_k(d) (\\mu * \\mu)\\left(\\frac{N}{d}\\right)$$\nThe arithmetic function $h = \\mu * \\mu$ is multiplicative. Its values on prime powers $p^j$ determine its value on any integer. We compute these values:\n$h(p^0) = h(1) = (\\mu * \\mu)(1) = \\mu(1)\\mu(1) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n$h(p^1) = h(p) = (\\mu * \\mu)(p) = \\mu(1)\\mu(p) + \\mu(p)\\mu(1) = 1(-1) + (-1)1 = -2$.\n$h(p^2) = (\\mu * \\mu)(p^2) = \\mu(1)\\mu(p^2) + \\mu(p)\\mu(p) + \\mu(p^2)\\mu(1) = 1(0) + (-1)(-1) + 0(1) = 1$.\nFor $j \\ge 3$, $(\\mu * \\mu)(p^j) = \\sum_{i=0}^j \\mu(p^i)\\mu(p^{j-i}) = 0$, since for any $i$, either $i>1$ or $j-i>1$, making at least one of the $\\mu$ terms zero.\n\nThe problem requires a procedure using \"only divisor sums and completely multiplicative functions\". The derived formula involves the function $\\mu*\\mu$, which is multiplicative but not completely multiplicative. However, the entire inversion process can be viewed as a repeated application of Möbius inversion, an operation tied to the completely multiplicative function $\\mathbf{1}$. Let $g_1 = g * \\mu$. Then $g_1 = (f * \\tau) * \\mu = f * (\\mathbf{1} * \\mathbf{1}) * \\mu = f * \\mathbf{1}$. Applying the inversion again, $g_1*\\mu = (f*\\mathbf{1})*\\mu = f$. Thus, the procedure is $f = (g * \\mu) * \\mu$. This iterative application of convolution with $\\mu$ constitutes the arithmetic inversion procedure.\n\nNow, we apply this procedure to the specific case where $k=2$ and $N=30$. We need to compute $s_2^{\\mathrm{new}}(30) = \\dim S_{2}^{\\mathrm{new}}(\\Gamma_{0}(30))$.\nThe formula is:\n$$s_2^{\\mathrm{new}}(30) = \\sum_{d|30} s_2(d) (\\mu * \\mu)\\left(\\frac{30}{d}\\right)$$\nThe divisors of $30$ are $\\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30\\}$.\nThe problem provides the following values for $s_2(d) = \\dim S_2(\\Gamma_0(d))$:\n- $s_2(d) = 0$ for $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10\\}$.\n- $s_2(15) = 1$.\n- $s_2(30) = 3$.\n\nDue to the number of zero-dimension spaces, most terms in the summation vanish. We only need to consider the terms for $d=15$ and $d=30$:\n$$s_2^{\\mathrm{new}}(30) = s_2(15) \\cdot (\\mu * \\mu)\\left(\\frac{30}{15}\\right) + s_2(30) \\cdot (\\mu * \\mu)\\left(\\frac{30}{30}\\right)$$\n$$s_2^{\\mathrm{new}}(30) = s_2(15) \\cdot (\\mu * \\mu)(2) + s_2(30) \\cdot (\\mu * \\mu)(1)$$\nWe compute the required values of the function $h(n) = (\\mu*\\mu)(n)$:\n- For $n=1$: $h(1) = 1$.\n- For $n=2$: $h(2) = -2$, since $2$ is a prime.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression:\n$$s_2^{\\mathrm{new}}(30) = (1) \\cdot (-2) + (3) \\cdot (1)$$\n$$s_2^{\\mathrm{new}}(30) = -2 + 3$$\n$$s_2^{\\mathrm{new}}(30) = 1$$\nThus, the dimension of the new subspace of cusp forms of weight $2$ for $\\Gamma_0(30)$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3011102"}]}
