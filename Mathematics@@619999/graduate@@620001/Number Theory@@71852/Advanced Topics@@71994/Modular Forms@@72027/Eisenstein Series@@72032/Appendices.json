The problem provides the definition of a holomorphic modular form $f$ of weight $k$ via the slash operator $f\\mid_k\\gamma=f$ for all $\\gamma \\in \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, the definition of the Eisenstein series $E_k(z)$, and asks for a proof of the vanishing of the space of modular forms of odd weight.\n*   **Step 2: Validate**. The question is a standard and fundamental result in the theory of modular forms. The premises are correct, and the task is a direct application of the definitions. The problem is mathematically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n*   **Step 3: Verdict**. The problem is valid. I will proceed with a full derivation and evaluate the given options.\n\n### Full Solution\nThere are two parts to the reasoning required by the question: first, showing the Eisenstein series $E_k(z)$ vanishes for odd $k$, and second, showing that the entire space of modular forms $M_k(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$ vanishes for odd $k$.\n\n**Part 1: Vanishing of $E_k(z)$ for odd $k$**\nThe Eisenstein series is defined as $E_k(z) = \\sum_{(m,n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}}\\frac{1}{(mz+n)^k}$. For $k > 2$, this series is absolutely convergent, which allows us to rearrange the terms of the sum. Let's pair the term for $(m,n)$ with the term for $(-m,-n)$. Note that if $(m,n) \\neq (0,0)$, then $(-m,-n) \\neq (0,0)$ and $(-m,-n) \\neq (m,n)$. The sum can be written as:\n$$ E_k(z) = \\sum_{\\{ (m,n), (-m,-n) \\}} \\left( \\frac{1}{(mz+n)^k} + \\frac{1}{(-m z - n)^k} \\right) $$\nWe can factor out $-1$ from the second term's denominator:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(-m z - n)^k} = \\frac{1}{(-1)^k (mz+n)^k} = (-1)^{-k} \\frac{1}{(mz+n)^k} $$\nIf $k$ is an odd integer, then $(-1)^{-k} = (-1)^k = -1$. The sum of the paired terms becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(mz+n)^k} - \\frac{1}{(mz+n)^k} = 0 $$\nSince every term in the sum cancels with its pair, the entire sum is zero. Therefore, $E_k(z) \\equiv 0$ for all odd integers $k > 2$.\n\n**Part 2: Vanishing of $M_k(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$ for odd $k$**\nLet $f$ be any holomorphic modular form of weight $k$ for $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. By definition, $f \\mid_k \\gamma = f$ for all $\\gamma \\in \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nConsider the specific matrix $\\gamma = -I = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix has integer entries and its determinant is $(-1)(-1) - (0)(0) = 1$, so it is an element of $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nApplying the transformation law for this matrix:\n$$ (f \\mid_k (-I))(z) = f(z) $$\nUsing the definition of the slash operator with $a=-1, b=0, c=0, d=-1$:\n$$ (f \\mid_k (-I))(z) = (0\\cdot z - 1)^{-k} f\\left(\\frac{-1\\cdot z + 0}{0\\cdot z - 1}\\right) = (-1)^{-k} f(z) $$\nEquating the two expressions, we get:\n$$ f(z) = (-1)^{-k} f(z) $$\nIf the weight $k$ is an odd integer, then $(-1)^{-k} = -1$. The identity becomes:\n$$ f(z) = -f(z) $$\nThis implies $2f(z) = 0$, which means $f(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathfrak{H}$. Thus, any modular form of odd weight must be the zero function. This holds for all non-negative integers $m$, so $M_{2m+1}(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))=\\{0\\}$.\n\n### Option Analysis\n*   **A. Pair the terms $(m,n)$ and $(-m,-n)$ in the definition of $E_k(z)$ to show that when $k$ is odd, the series cancels termwise and hence $E_k(z)\\equiv 0$; then use the identity $f\\mid_k(-I)=f$ for any $f\\in M_k(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$) together with $-I=\\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix}$ to conclude $f(z)=(-1)^k f(z)$, and for odd $k$ this forces $f\\equiv 0$, so $M_{2m+1}(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))=\\{0\\}$ for all $m\\ge 0$.**\n    *   This option is correct. It provides both necessary arguments: the specific vanishing of the Eisenstein series and the general vanishing of the entire space of odd-weight modular forms using the matrix $-I$.\n\n*   **B. Note that holomorphic functions on $\\mathfrak{H}$ cannot have odd parity with respect to complex conjugation; therefore all odd weight Eisenstein series vanish, and every odd weight modular form must be constant zero.**\n    *   This statement is incorrect and vague. The concept of \"odd parity with respect to complex conjugation\" is not a standard one applied in this context, and it is not the reason for the vanishing of odd-weight modular forms.\n\n*   **C. The Hecke operators at all primes act trivially on odd weights, so the odd weight Eisenstein series and every odd weight modular form are annihilated, implying $M_{2m+1}(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))=\\{0\\}$.**\n    *   This is not the fundamental reason. While properties of Hecke operators are related, the proof does not require them. The argument based on the matrix $-I$ is more elementary and direct, relying only on the definition of a modular form.\n\n*   **D. Use the relation $S^2=I$ for $S=\\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}\\in\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ to deduce that any modular form is invariant under $z\\mapsto -1/z$ without a weight factor; thus odd weights are incompatible and must vanish, including the odd weight Eisenstein series.**\n    *   This contains a factual error. For $S=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$, we have $S^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix} = -I$, not $I$.

Vanishing order of $E_k(\\tau)$**\n\nThe normalized Eisenstein series is defined as $E_k(\\tau) = \\frac{G_k(\\tau)}{2\\zeta(k)}$. To find the constant term of its q-expansion, we evaluate the limit of $E_k(\\tau)$ as the imaginary part of $\\tau$ goes to infinity.\nLet's first analyze the limit of $G_k(\\tau)$:\n$$\nG_{k}(\\tau) = \\sum_{(m,n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}} \\frac{1}{(m+n\\tau)^{k}}\n$$\nWe can split the sum based on the value of $n$:\n$$\nG_{k}(\\tau) = \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{m^k} + \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{1}{(m+n\\tau)^k}\n$$\nThe first term corresponds to $n=0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{m^k} = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^k} + \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(-m)^k}\n$$\nSince $k$ is an even integer, $(-m)^k = m^k$. Thus, this part of the sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^k} + \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^k} = 2 \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^k} = 2\\zeta(k)\n$$\nNow consider the second part of the sum, where $n \\neq 0$. As $\\tau \\to i\\infty$, the imaginary part of $\\tau$ tends to infinity. For any fixed non-zero integer $n$ and any integer $m$, the magnitude of the denominator becomes large:\n$$\n|m+n\\tau| \\ge |n| \\operatorname{Im}(\\tau) \\to \\infty\n$$\nSince $k \\geq 4$, the series $\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{1}{(m+n\\tau)^k}$ is absolutely convergent, which allows us to take the limit term by term. Each term $\\frac{1}{(m+n\\tau)^k}$ goes to $0$ as $\\tau \\to i\\infty$. Therefore, the sum over all $n \\neq 0$ vanishes in this limit.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\tau \\to i\\infty} \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{1}{(m+n\\tau)^k} = 0\n$$\nCombining these results, the limit of $G_k(\\tau)$ is:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\tau \\to i\\infty} G_k(\\tau) = 2\\zeta(k) + 0 = 2\\zeta(k)\n$$\nThis limit is the constant term of the q-expansion of $G_k(\\tau)$.\nNow, for the normalized Eisenstein series $E_k(\\tau)$, the constant term is:\n$$\na_0 = \\lim_{\\tau \\to i\\infty} E_k(\\tau) = \\lim_{\\tau \\to i\\infty} \\frac{G_k(\\tau)}{2\\zeta(k)} = \\frac{2\\zeta(k)}{2\\zeta(k)} = 1\n$$\nSince the constant term $a_0 = 1$ is non-zero, the minimum non-negative integer $n$ for which $a_n \\neq 0$ is $n=0$. By the definition of the vanishing order,\n$$\n\\operatorname{ord}_{\\infty}(E_k) = 0\n$$\n\n**2. Vanishing order of $E_4^a(\\tau) E_6^b(\\tau)$**\n\nLet $f(\\tau) = E_4^a(\\tau) E_6^b(\\tau)$ for non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. We need to find the constant term in the q-expansion of $f(\\tau)$.\nFrom the previous analysis, we know that for any even $k \\ge 4$, the q-expansion of $E_k(\\tau)$ starts with a constant term of $1$.\nSo, $E_4(\\tau) = 1 + c_1 q + c_2 q^2 + \\dots$ for some coefficients $c_n$.\nAnd $E_6(\\tau) = 1 + d_1 q + d_2 q^2 + \\dots$ for some coefficients $d_n$.\n\nThe function $E_4^a(\\tau)$ is the $a$-th power of the q-series for $E_4(\\tau)$:\n$$\nE_4^a(\\tau) = (1 + c_1 q + \\dots)^a = 1^a + a(1)^{a-1}(c_1 q) + \\dots = 1 + a c_1 q + \\dots\n$$\nThe constant term of $E_4^a(\\tau)$ is $1$.\nSimilarly, the function $E_6^b(\\tau)$ is:\n$$\nE_6^b(\\tau) = (1 + d_1 q + \\dots)^b = 1^b + b(1)^{b-1}(d_1 q) + \\dots = 1 + b d_1 q + \\dots\n$$\nThe constant term of $E_6^b(\\tau)$ is $1$.\n\nThe q-expansion of the product $f(\\tau) = E_4^a(\\tau) E_6^b(\\tau)$ is the product of their respective q-expansions:\n$$\nf(\\tau) = (1 + a c_1 q + \\dots) \\cdot (1 + b d_1 q + \\dots) = 1 + (a c_1 + b d_1)q + \\dots\n$$\nThe constant term of $f(\\tau)$ is the product of the constant terms, which is $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nSince the constant term of the q-expansion for $f(\\tau) = E_4^a(\\tau) E_6^b(\\tau)$ is $1$ (which is non-zero), the lowest power of $q$ with a non-zero coefficient is $q^0$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\operatorname{ord}_{\\infty}(E_4^a E_6^b) = 0\n$$\n\n**3. Vanishing order of $\\Delta(\\tau)$**\n\nThe modular discriminant $\\Delta(\\tau)$ is given by the q-product:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\tau) = q \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^n)^{24}\n$$\nLet's analyze the product part, $P(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^n)^{24}$. This is an infinite product of power series in $q$. Each factor is of the form $(1 - q^n)^{24}$.\nFor $n=1$, we have $(1-q)^{24} = 1 - 24q + \\binom{24}{2}q^2 - \\dots$\nFor $n=2$, we have $(1-q^2)^{24} = 1 - 24q^2 + \\binom{24}{2}q^4 - \\dots$\nAnd so on. The constant term of each factor $(1-q^n)^{24}$ is $1$.\nThe constant term of the product $P(q)$ is the product of the constant terms of each factor, which is $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\dots = 1$.\nThus, the q-expansion of $P(q)$ begins with $1$:\n$$\nP(q) = 1 + c_1 q + c_2 q^2 + \\dots\n$$\nNow, we can write the q-expansion for $\\Delta(\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\tau) = q \\cdot P(q) = q(1 + c_1 q + c_2 q^2 + \\dots) = q + c_1 q^2 + c_2 q^3 + \\dots\n$$\nLet the q-expansion of $\\Delta(\\tau)$ be denoted by $\\sum_{n \\ge 0} d_n q^n$. By comparing coefficients, we have:\n$d_0 = 0$\n$d_1 = 1$\n$d_2 = c_1$, etc.\nThe set of non-negative integers $n$ for which the coefficient $d_n$ is non-zero starts with $n=1$, since $d_1 = 1 \\neq 0$. The coefficient of $q^0$ is $d_0=0$.\nAccording to the definition, the vanishing order is the minimum such $n$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{ord}_{\\infty}(\\Delta) = \\min\\{ n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0} : d_n \\neq 0 \\} = 1\n$$\nThis is consistent with $\\Delta(\\tau)$ being a cusp form, which by definition must vanish at the cusps.\n\nThe three requested values are $\\operatorname{ord}_{\\infty}(E_{k})=0$, $\\operatorname{ord}_{\\infty}(E_{4}^{a}E_{6}^{b})=0$, and $\\operatorname{ord}_{\\infty}(\\Delta)=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3012697"}]}
