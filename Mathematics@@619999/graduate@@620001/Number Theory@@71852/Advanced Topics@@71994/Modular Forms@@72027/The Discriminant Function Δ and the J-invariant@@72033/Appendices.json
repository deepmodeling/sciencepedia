We need to determine the first few terms of this series to calculate the expansion of $P(q) = f(q)^{24}$ up to the required order.\n\nThe expansion of $f(q)$ is given by:\n$$ f(q) = (1-q)(1-q^2)(1-q^3)(1-q^4)\\cdots $$\nTo find the coefficient of a term $q^k$ in this expansion, we must consider all ways that $k$ can be formed as a sum of distinct positive integers, $k = n_1 + n_2 + \\dots + n_m$ with $n_1 < n_2 < \\dots < n_m$. Each such partition of $k$ into $m$ distinct parts corresponds to a term $(-q^{n_1})(-q^{n_2})\\cdots(-q^{n_m}) = (-1)^m q^k$ in the expansion. The coefficient of $q^k$ is therefore the sum of $(-1)^m$ over all partitions of $k$ into $m$ distinct parts. Let's calculate the coefficients for $k=0, 1, 2, 3$.\n- For $k=0$: The only way is the empty product, giving the term $1$.\n- For $k=1$: The only partition into distinct parts is $\\{1\\}$. This has $m=1$ part. The coefficient is $(-1)^1 = -1$.\n- For $k=2$: The only partition into distinct parts is $\\{2\\}$. This has $m=1$ part. The coefficient is $(-1)^1 = -1$.\n- For $k=3$: There are two partitions into distinct parts: $\\{3\\}$ and $\\{1,2\\}$. The first has $m=1$ part, contributing $(-1)^1 = -1$. The second has $m=2$ parts, contributing $(-1)^2 = 1$. The total coefficient is $-1 + 1 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the expansion of $f(q)$ up to the $q^3$ term is:\n$$ f(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{n}) = 1 - q - q^2 + 0 \\cdot q^3 + O(q^4) = 1 - q - q^2 + O(q^4) $$\nWe are looking for the coefficient of $q^3$ in $P(q) = f(q)^{24}$. Let's denote the truncated polynomial by $f_{trunc}(q) = 1 - q - q^2$ and the remainder by $R(q) = f(q) - f_{trunc}(q) = O(q^4)$. Then:\n$$ P(q) = (f_{trunc}(q) + R(q))^{24} = \\sum_{k=0}^{24} \\binom{24}{k} (f_{trunc}(q))^{24-k} (R(q))^k $$\nThe first term is $(f_{trunc}(q))^{24}$. The second term is $\\binom{24}{1} (f_{trunc}(q))^{23} R(q)$. Since $f_{trunc}(q) = 1 - q - q^2 = O(1)$ and $R(q) = O(q^4)$, this second term is of order $O(q^4)$.

We demonstrate that $F(\\tau)$ satisfies these properties.\n1.  Transformation Property: $E_{4}(\\tau)$ is a modular form of weight $4$ for $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, and $\\Delta(\\tau)$ is a cusp form of weight $12$ for $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. For any $\\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, we have $E_{4}(\\gamma\\tau) = (c\\tau+d)^{4}E_{4}(\\tau)$ and $\\Delta(\\gamma\\tau) = (c\\tau+d)^{12}\\Delta(\\tau)$. The quotient $F(\\tau)$ transforms as:\n    $$F(\\gamma\\tau) = \\frac{E_{4}(\\gamma\\tau)^{3}}{\\Delta(\\gamma\\tau)} = \\frac{((c\\tau+d)^{4}E_{4}(\\tau))^{3}}{(c\\tau+d)^{12}\\Delta(\\tau)} = \\frac{(c\\tau+d)^{12}E_{4}(\\tau)^{3}}{(c\\tau+d)^{12}\\Delta(\\tau)} = F(\\tau)$$\n    This shows $F(\\tau)$ is modular invariant, i.e., a modular function for $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  Poles and Zeros: $\\Delta(\\tau)$ is known to be non-zero on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$, with a simple zero at the cusp $\\tau \\to i\\infty$ (i.e., $q=0$). $E_{4}(\\tau)$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{H}$. Therefore, $F(\\tau)$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{H}$.\n3.  Behavior at the Cusp: As shown by our calculation of its $q$-expansion, $F(\\tau)$ has a simple pole at the cusp, with leading term $q^{-1}$:\n    $F(\\tau) = q^{-1} + 744 + O(q)$.\nThe classical $j$-invariant, $j(\\tau)$, is defined as the unique modular function for $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ that is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{H}$ and has a $q$-expansion of the form $j(\\tau) = q^{-1} + C + O(q)$. Any such function is a generator for the field of modular functions for $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. If we consider the difference $G(\\tau) = F(\\tau) - j(\\tau)$, $G(\\tau)$ is a modular function for $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ and is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{H}$. At the cusp, the $q^{-1}$ terms cancel, implying $G(\\tau)$ is holomorphic at the cusp. A modular function that is holomorphic everywhere (on $\\mathbb{H}$ and at the cusp) must be a constant. The value of this constant is given by the limit as $q \\to 0$. By standard definition, the constant term of $j(\\tau)$ is $744$. Our calculation shows the constant term of $F(\\tau)$ is also $744$. Thus, $G(\\tau) = (q^{-1} + 744 + \\dots) - (q^{-1} + 744 + \\dots) = O(q)$, which tends to $0$ as $q \\to 0$. Therefore, the constant must be $0$, so $G(\\tau)=0$ for all $\\tau$, which means $F(\\tau)=j(\\tau)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the truncated expression for $j(\\tau)$ up to the $q^{2}$ term, which is our computed expression for $F(\\tau)$. With coefficients $c_0=744, c_1=196884, c_2=21493760$, the truncated expression is $q^{-1} + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{q^{-1} + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3025744"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise bridges the analytic theory of functions on the upper half-plane with the geometric theory of invariants of lattices in the complex plane.

The lattice is $L = \\mathbb{Z} + i\\mathbb{Z}$, which is the set of Gaussian integers. An arbitrary element of the lattice is $\\omega = m+ni$ for integers $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Multiplication by $i$ gives $i\\omega = i(m+ni) = mi + ni^2 = -n+mi$. Since $m$ and $n$ are integers, $-n$ is also an integer. Thus, $-n+mi$ is an element of the form $m'+n'i$ with $m'=-n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $n'=m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, which is an element of $L$. This shows that $iL \\subseteq L$. Conversely, any element $\\omega = m+ni \\in L$ can be written as $i(-mi+n)$, and since $-m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $-mi+n \\in L$. Thus $\\omega \\in iL$, which shows $L \\subseteq iL$. Therefore, the lattice is invariant under multiplication by $i$, i.e., $iL = L$.\n\nThe Eisenstein series $G_k(\\tau)$ is defined as a sum over the non-zero lattice points:\n$$G_{k}(\\tau) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in L \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{\\omega^k}$$\nFor $\\tau=i$, we have $L=\\mathbb{Z}+i\\mathbb{Z}$. Since multiplication by $i$ is a bijection from $L\\setminus\\{0\\}$ to itself, we can re-index the sum by replacing $\\omega$ with $i\\omega$:\n$$G_{k}(i) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in L \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{(i\\omega)^k} = \\frac{1}{i^k} \\sum_{\\omega \\in L \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{\\omega^k} = i^{-k} G_k(i)$$\nThe sum is absolutely convergent for even $k \\ge 4$, so this manipulation is valid.\nFor $k=6$, we have $i^6 = (i^2)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1$. The equation becomes:\n$$G_{6}(i) = i^{-6} G_6(i) = (-1) G_6(i)$$\nThis implies $2G_6(i) = 0$, so $G_6(i)=0$.\nThe Weierstrass invariant $g_3(\\tau)$ is defined as $g_3(\\tau)=140\\,G_6(\\tau)$. At $\\tau=i$, we have $g_3(i) = 140\\,G_6(i) = 140 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nFor $k=4$, we have $i^4 = (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$. The equation becomes:\n$$G_{4}(i) = i^{-4} G_4(i) = (1) G_4(i)$$\nThis is a tautology, $G_4(i)=G_4(i)$, and does not imply $G_4(i)=0$. To show $G_4(i) \\neq 0$, we can examine its Fourier series expansion. The normalized Eisenstein series $E_{4}(\\tau)$ is related to $G_4(\\tau)$ by $G_4(\\tau) = 2\\zeta(4)E_4(\\tau)$.

Thus, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sigma_{3}(n)\\exp(-2\\pi n) > 0$, which implies $E_4(i) > 1$. As the Riemann zeta value $\\zeta(4) = \\pi^4/90$ is also positive, $G_4(i) = 2(\\pi^4/90)E_4(i)$ is a positive real number. Therefore, $G_4(i) \\neq 0$.\nConsequently, $g_2(i) = 60\\,G_4(i) \\neq 0$.\n\n**Task 2: Eisenstein Series Relations and the Constant $C$**\n\nThe Fourier expansion of the Eisenstein series $G_k(\\tau)$ is given by\n$$G_k(\\tau) = 2\\zeta(k) + 2\\frac{(2\\pi i)^k}{(k-1)!} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{k-1}(n)q^n$$\nThe normalized Eisenstein series $E_k(\\tau)$ is defined by $G_k(\\tau) = 2\\zeta(k)E_k(\\tau)$, which implies\n$$E_k(\\tau) = 1 + \\frac{(2\\pi i)^k}{(k-1)! (2\\zeta(k))} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{k-1}(n)q^n$$\nFor $k=4$:\n$$E_4(\\tau) = 1 + \\frac{(2\\pi i)^4}{3! (2\\zeta(4))} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{3}(n)q^n = 1 + \\frac{16\\pi^4}{12\\zeta(4)} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{3}(n)q^n$$\nComparing this to the given expansion $E_4(\\tau) = 1+240\\sum \\sigma_3(n)q^n$, we equate the coefficients:\n$$240 = \\frac{16\\pi^4}{12\\zeta(4)} \\implies \\zeta(4) = \\frac{16\\pi^4}{12 \\cdot 240} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{90}$$\nNow we relate $g_2(\\tau)$ to $E_4(\\tau)$:\n$$g_2(\\tau) = 60\\,G_4(\\tau) = 60(2\\zeta(4)E_4(\\tau)) = 120\\left(\\frac{\\pi^4}{90}\\right)E_4(\\tau) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi^4 E_4(\\tau)$$\nThus, the constant is $A=4/3$.\n\nFor $k=6$:\n$$E_6(\\tau) = 1 + \\frac{(2\\pi i)^6}{5! (2\\zeta(6))} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{5}(n)q^n = 1 + \\frac{-64\\pi^6}{240\\zeta(6)} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{5}(n)q^n$$\nComparing this to $E_6(\\tau) = 1-504\\sum \\sigma_5(n)q^n$:\n$$-504 = \\frac{-64\\pi^6}{240\\zeta(6)} \\implies \\zeta(6) = \\frac{64\\pi^6}{504 \\cdot 240} = \\frac{\\pi^6}{945}$$\nNow we relate $g_3(\\tau)$ to $E_6(\\tau)$:\n$$g_3(\\tau) = 140\\,G_6(\\tau) = 140(2\\zeta(6)E_6(\\tau)) = 280\\left(\\frac{\\pi^6}{945}\\right)E_6(\\tau) = \\frac{8}{27}\\pi^6 E_6(\\tau)$$\nThus, the constant is $B=8/27$.\n\nTo prove the relation $E_{4}(\\tau)^{3}-E_{6}(\\tau)^{2}=C\\,\\Delta(\\tau)$, we use properties of modular forms for the full modular group $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. $E_4(\\tau)$ is a modular form of weight $4$ and $E_6(\\tau)$ is a modular form of weight $6$.\nProducts of modular forms are modular forms, with weights adding up. Thus, $E_4(\\tau)^3$ is a modular form of weight $3 \\times 4 = 12$, and $E_6(\\tau)^2$ is a modular form of weight $2 \\times 6 = 12$. The difference $F(\\tau) = E_4(\\tau)^3 - E_6(\\tau)^2$ is also a modular form of weight $12$.\n\nA modular form is a cusp form if its Fourier expansion has a constant term of zero (i.e., it vanishes at the cusp $i\\infty$). Let's examine the Fourier expansion of $F(\\tau)$:\n$$E_4(\\tau) = 1 + 240q + O(q^2)$$\n$$E_6(\\tau) = 1 - 504q + O(q^2)$$\n$$E_4(\\tau)^3 = (1 + 240q + \\ldots)^3 = 1^3 + 3(1)^2(240q) + O(q^2) = 1 + 720q + O(q^2)$$\n$$E_6(\\tau)^2 = (1 - 504q + \\ldots)^2 = 1^2 - 2(1)(504q) + O(q^2) = 1 - 1008q + O(q^2)$$\n$$F(\\tau) = E_4(\\tau)^3 - E_6(\\tau)^2 = (1 + 720q) - (1 - 1008q) + O(q^2) = (720 - (-1008))q + O(q^2) = 1728q + O(q^2)$$\nThe constant term ($q^0$ coefficient) of $F(\\tau)$ is $1-1=0$, so $F(\\tau)$ is a cusp form of weight $12$. The complex vector space of cusp forms of weight $12$ for $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, denoted $S_{12}(SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}))$, is one-dimensional. It is spanned by the modular discriminant function $\\Delta(\\tau)$.\nTherefore, $F(\\tau)$ must be a constant multiple of $\\Delta(\\tau)$:\n$$E_4(\\tau)^3 - E_6(\\tau)^2 = C\\,\\Delta(\\tau)$$\nTo find the constant $C$, we compare the leading coefficients in their Fourier expansions. The expansion of $\\Delta(\\tau)$ is given as $\\Delta(\\tau) = q \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)^{24} = q + O(q^2)$.\nComparing the $q^1$ terms:\n$$1728q = C \\cdot q$$\nThis immediately gives $C=1728$.\n\n**Task 3: The j-invariant $j(\\tau)$ and its value at $\\tau=i$**\n\nThe $j$-invariant, or modular invariant, is a modular function of weight $0$. A standard definition in terms of the Weierstrass invariants is:\n$$j(\\tau) = 1728 \\frac{g_2(\\tau)^3}{g_2(\\tau)^3 - 27g_3(\\tau)^2}$$\nThe denominator, $\\Delta_L(\\tau) = g_2(\\tau)^3 - 27g_3(\\tau)^2$, is the discriminant of the lattice. From Task 2, we can express this in terms of the normalized modular discriminant $\\Delta(\\tau)$:\n$$g_2(\\tau)^3 - 27g_3(\\tau)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi^4 E_4(\\tau)\\right)^3 - 27\\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\pi^6 E_6(\\tau)\\right)^2$$\n$$= \\frac{64}{27}\\pi^{12}E_4(\\tau)^3 - 27\\left(\\frac{64}{729}\\right)\\pi^{12}E_6(\\tau)^2 = \\frac{64}{27}\\pi^{12}\\left(E_4(\\tau)^3 - E_6(\\tau)^2\\right)$$\nUsing $E_4(\\tau)^3 - E_6(\\tau)^2 = 1728\\Delta(\\tau)$, we have:\n$$g_2(\\tau)^3 - 27g_3(\\tau)^2 = \\frac{64}{27}\\pi^{12}(1728\\Delta(\\tau)) = (4096)\\pi^{12}\\Delta(\\tau) = (2\\pi)^{12}\\Delta(\\tau)$$\nThis confirms the denominator is proportional to $\\Delta(\\tau)$ and non-zero for $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{H}$. The expression for $j(\\tau)$ is therefore well-defined.\n\nWe now compute $j(i)$ by substituting $\\tau=i$ into the definition:\n$$j(i) = 1728 \\frac{g_2(i)^3}{g_2(i)^3 - 27g_3(i)^2}$$\nFrom the results of Task 1, we established that $g_3(i)=0$ and $g_2(i) \\neq 0$. Substituting these values:\n$$j(i) = 1728 \\frac{g_2(i)^3}{g_2(i)^3 - 27(0)^2} = 1728 \\frac{g_2(i)^3}{g_2(i)^3}$$\nSince $g_2(i) \\neq 0$, the term $g_2(i)^3$ can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator:\n$$j(i) = 1728$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1728}$$", "id": "3025730"}]}
