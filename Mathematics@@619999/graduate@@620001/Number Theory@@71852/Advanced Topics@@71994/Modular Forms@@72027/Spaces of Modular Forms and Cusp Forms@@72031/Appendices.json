The theorem states:\n$$2g(X) - 2 = (\\deg \\pi)(2g(Y) - 2) + \\sum_{P \\in X} (e_P - 1)$$\nwhere $g(X)$ and $g(Y)$ are the genera of the surfaces, $\\deg \\pi$ is the degree of the map, and $e_P$ is the ramification index of $\\pi$ at a point $P \\in X$.\n\nIn our case, $X = X_0(37)$ and $Y = X(1)$. The map $\\pi: X_0(37) \\to X(1)$ is induced by the inclusion of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(37)$ into $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The Riemann surfaces are quotients of the extended upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H}^*$ by the action of the corresponding projective groups, $\\bar{\\Gamma}_0(37) = \\Gamma_0(37)\\{\\pm I\\}/\\{\\pm I\\}$ and $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the known quantities. The modular curve $X(1)$ is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{P}^1$, so its genus is $g(X(1)) = 0$.\n\nNext, we determine the degree of the map, $\\deg \\pi$. The degree is the number of sheets in the covering, which can be determined by examining the cusps. The map $\\pi$ ramifies over the single cusp of $X(1)$, and the sum of the ramification indices of the cusps on $X_0(37)$ must equal the degree of the map. The ramification index of a cusp on $X_0(N)$ over the cusp of $X(1)$ is its width.\n\nThe cusps of $X_0(N)$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the pairs $(d, [x])$ where $d$ is a positive divisor of $N$ and $[x]$ is an orbit of $(\\mathbb{Z}/(d, N/d)\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The number of cusps, $\\nu_\\infty(N)$, is given by the formula $\\nu_\\infty(N) = \\sum_{d|N} \\phi(\\gcd(d, N/d))$. For $N=37$, a prime number, the divisors are $1$ and $37$.\n- For $d=1$: $\\phi(\\gcd(1, 37)) = \\phi(1) = 1$. This corresponds to the cusp at $\\infty$.\n- For $d=37$: $\\phi(\\gcd(37, 1)) = \\phi(1) = 1$. This corresponds to the cusp at $0$.\nSo, $\\nu_\\infty(37) = 2$.\n\nThe width of the cusp corresponding to $d$ is $N/d^2 \\cdot (d, N/d) = N/d \\cdot 1/(d,N/d)$. A more direct formula for the width of a cusp represented by a rational number $a/c$ with $\\gcd(a,c)=1$ is $N/\\gcd(c^2, N)$.\n- For the cusp at $\\infty \\sim 1/0$, the width is $1$.\n- For the cusp at $0 \\sim 0/1$, we take $c=1$. The width is $37/\\gcd(1^2, 37) = 37$.\nThe sum of the widths of the cusps is $1 + 37 = 38$. This sum must be equal to the degree of the map.

Ramification of the map $\\pi$ occurs only over the special points of $X(1)$: the elliptic points of order $2$ and $3$ (images of $i$ and $\\rho=e^{2i\\pi/3}$ in $\\mathcal{H}$, respectively) and the cusp (image of $\\infty$).\n\nLet's calculate the contribution to the ramification sum from each of these three points.\n1.  **Fiber over the cusp of $X(1)$:** The preimages are the two cusps of $X_0(37)$. Their ramification indices are their widths, $e_1=1$ and $e_2=37$. The contribution to the sum is $(e_1-1)+(e_2-1) = (1-1) + (37-1) = 36$.\n\n2.  **Fiber over the elliptic point of order 2 on $X(1)$ (image of $i$):** The contribution from this fiber is $\\sum_{P \\in \\pi^{-1}([i])} (e_P - 1) = \\deg \\pi - |\\pi^{-1}([i])| = 38 - |\\pi^{-1}([i])|$.

Points $P$ with a stabilizer of order $2$ are the elliptic points of order $2$ on $X_0(37)$. The number of such points, $\\nu_2(N)$, for $N=37$ is given by $\\nu_2(37) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{37}\\right)$.

The counting formula becomes:\n    $$\\nu_2(37) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + n_{i,1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1} = 19 \\implies 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + n_{i,1} = 19 \\implies 1 + n_{i,1} = 19 \\implies n_{i,1} = 18$$\n    The total number of points in the fiber is $|\\pi^{-1}([i])| = \\nu_2(37) + n_{i,1} = 2+18=20$.\n    The contribution to the ramification sum is $38 - 20 = 18$.\n\n3.  **Fiber over the elliptic point of order 3 on $X(1)$ (image of $\\rho$):** The contribution is $38 - |\\pi^{-1}([\\rho])|$. The counting formula is:\n    $$\\sum_{P \\in \\pi^{-1}([\\rho])} \\frac{1}{|\\mathrm{Stab}_{\\bar{\\Gamma}_0(37)}(P)|} = \\frac{\\deg \\pi}{|\\mathrm{Stab}_{\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})}(\\rho)|} = \\frac{38}{3}$$\n    The stabilizer can have order $1$ or $3$. The number of points with a stabilizer of order $3$ is $\\nu_3(37) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{-3}{37}\\right)$. We have $\\left(\\frac{-3}{37}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{37}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{37}\\right) = (1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{37}{3}\\right)(-1)^{\\frac{3-1}{2}\\frac{37-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1$.

Let $n_{\\rho,1}$ be the number of points in the fiber with a trivial stabilizer.\n    $$\\nu_3(37) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + n_{\\rho,1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1} = \\frac{38}{3} \\implies 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + n_{\\rho,1} = \\frac{38}{3} \\implies n_{\\rho,1} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12$$\n    The total number of points in the fiber is $|\\pi^{-1}([\\rho])| = \\nu_3(37) + n_{\\rho,1} = 2+12=14$.\n    The contribution to the ramification sum is $38 - 14 = 24$.\n\nThe total ramification term is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\\sum_{P \\in X_0(37)} (e_P - 1) = 36 + 18 + 24 = 78$$\nSubstituting this back into the Riemann-Hurwitz formula:\n$$2g\\big(X_0(37)\\big) - 2 = -76 + 78 = 2$$\n$$2g\\big(X_0(37)\\big) = 4$$\n$$g\\big(X_0(37)\\big) = 2$$\n\nNow we determine the dimension of the space of weight $2$ cusp forms, $\\dim S_2\\big(\\Gamma_0(37)\\big)$. There is a fundamental isomorphism in the theory of modular forms which identifies the complex vector space of weight $2$ cusp forms for a group $\\Gamma$, $S_2(\\Gamma)$, with the space of holomorphic differentials (or holomorphic $1$-forms), $\\Omega^1(X(\\Gamma))$, on the corresponding modular curve $X(\\Gamma)$:\n$$S_2(\\Gamma) \\cong \\Omega^1(X(\\Gamma))$$\nThe dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials on a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$ is equal to $g$.

These formulas depend on the weight $k$ of the forms, the genus $g$ of the corresponding modular curve, and the number of cusps and elliptic points of the congruence subgroup.\n\nLet $\\Gamma = \\Gamma_{0}(3)$.

For $N=3$, the index is $[\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_{0}(3)] = 3+1 = 4$.\n\n2.  **Number of cusps, $\\nu_{\\infty}$:** The number of cusps of $\\Gamma_{0}(N)$ is given by $\\nu_{\\infty} = \\sum_{d \\mid N} \\phi(\\gcd(d, N/d))$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function. For $N=3$, the divisors are $d=1$ and $d=3$.\n    -   $d=1$: $\\phi(\\gcd(1, 3)) = \\phi(1) = 1$.\n    -   $d=3$: $\\phi(\\gcd(3, 1)) = \\phi(1) = 1$.\n    Thus, $\\nu_{\\infty} = 1+1=2$. The two inequivalent cusps can be represented by $\\infty$ and $0$.\n\n3.  **Number of elliptic points, $\\nu_{2}$ and $\\nu_{3}$:**\n    -   The number of elliptic points of order $2$ for $\\Gamma_{0}(N)$ is $\\nu_2 = \\prod_{p \\mid N} (1 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right))$ if $4 \\nmid N$, and $\\nu_2=0$ if $4 \\mid N$. Here $N=3$, so $4 \\nmid 3$. $\\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right) = -1$.

For $N=3$, the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{-3}{3}\\right)$ is $0$. The formula can also be stated as the number of solutions to $x^2+x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. $x^2+x+1 \\equiv x^2-2x+1 = (x-1)^2 \\pmod 3$. The equation $(x-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$ has one solution $x=1$.

The dimension of $E_{k}(\\Gamma)$ is the number of regular cusps. For $k \\ge 4$ and trivial nebentypus, all cusps are regular. Thus, $\\dim E_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3)) = \\nu_{\\infty} = 2$.\n    $$\\dim M_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3)) = \\dim S_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3)) + \\dim E_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3)) = 0 + 2 = 2$$\n\nSo, $\\dim M_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3)) = 2$ and $\\dim S_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3)) = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Basis of $M_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3))$\n\nSince $\\dim M_{4}(\\Gamma_{0}(3)) = 2$, we need to find two linearly independent modular forms in this space. As the dimension of the cuspidal subspace is $0$, the basis will consist of Eisenstein series.\n\nThe space of modular forms for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ contains oldforms, which come from levels dividing $N$. For $N=3$, the divisors are $1$ and $3$. The space $M_4(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$ is one-dimensional, spanned by the Eisenstein series $E_4(z)$. The oldforms in $M_4(\\Gamma_0(3))$ are constructed from functions $f(dz)$ where $f \\in M_4(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$ and $d$ divides $3$.\nThis suggests using $f_1(z) = E_4(z)$ and $f_2(z) = E_4(3z)$ as potential basis vectors.\n\nWe must verify that both functions are in $M_4(\\Gamma_0(3))$.\n-   For $f_1(z) = E_4(z)$: It is a modular form of weight $4$ for the full modular group $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\Gamma_0(3) \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, $f_1(z)$ automatically satisfies the transformation property for $\\Gamma_0(3)$. Holomorphy at all cusps of $\\Gamma_0(3)$ is also inherited from being a form for $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, $E_4(z) \\in M_4(\\Gamma_0(3))$.\n\n-   For $f_2(z) = E_4(3z)$: Let $\\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\Gamma_0(3)$. Then $c=3c'$ for some $c' \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    $$f_2(\\gamma z) = E_4\\left(3\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\\right) = E_4\\left(\\frac{a(3z)+3b}{(c/3)(3z)+d}\\right)$$\n    Let $z' = 3z$ and $\\gamma' = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 3b \\\\ c/3 & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 3b \\\\ c' & d \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $ad - (3b)(c') = ad-bc=1$, so $\\gamma' \\in \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $E_4$ is a modular form for $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$,\n    $$E_4(\\gamma'z') = (c'z'+d)^4 E_4(z') = ((c/3)(3z)+d)^4 E_4(3z) = (cz+d)^4 f_2(z)$$\n    The transformation property holds. For holomorphy at the cusps, we check $\\infty$ and $0$. At $\\infty$, $f_2(z) = E_4(3z) = 1 + 240\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sigma_3(n)q^{3n}$, which is holomorphic. At cusp $0$, we examine the behavior of $f_2$ under the Atkin-Lehner involution $W_3$, which swaps the cusps $\\infty$ and $0$. The action is $f_2|_4 W_3(z) = \\frac{1}{9}E_4(z)$, which is holomorphic at $\\infty$. This implies $f_2(z)$ is holomorphic at $0$. So, $E_4(3z) \\in M_4(\\Gamma_0(3))$.\n\nThe functions $E_4(z) = 1+240q+\\dots$ and $E_4(3z)=1+240q^3+\\dots$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{C}$.\nThus, $\\{E_4(z), E_4(3z)\\}$ is a basis for $M_4(\\Gamma_0(3))$.\n\nThe problem asks about a nonzero cuspidal eta product. Since we found $\\dim S_4(\\Gamma_0(3))=0$, no such form can exist. This can be verified directly: an eta product $\\prod_{d|3} \\eta(dz)^{r_d}$ has weight $k = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum r_d$. For k=4, $r_1+r_3=8$. The modularity conditions for $\\Gamma_0(3)$ require $r_1+3r_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$ and $3r_1+r_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$. Substituting $r_1=8-r_3$ into the first gives $8+2r_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$, or $r_3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$. Substituting into the second gives $24-2r_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$, or $r_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. These conditions are contradictory, so no such eta product exists.\n\n### Part 3: Matrices of Hecke operators $T_2$ and $T_3$\n\nLet the ordered basis be $B = \\{f_1(z), f_2(z)\\} = \\{E_4(z), E_4(3z)\\}$. We compute the matrix representations of $T_2$ and $T_3=U_3$ with respect to this basis.

For $k=4, p=2$, the eigenvalue is $1+2^3=9$. So, $T_2(E_4(z)) = 9 E_4(z)$.\nThus, $T_2(f_1) = 9 f_1 = 9f_1 + 0f_2$. The first column of the matrix for $T_2$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor $f_2(z)=E_4(3z)$, we can use the property that for $p \\nmid N$, $T_p(f(dz)) = (T_p f)(dz)$.\n$T_2(f_2) = T_2(E_4(3z)) = (T_2 E_4)(3z) = (9 E_4)(3z) = 9 E_4(3z) = 9f_2$.\nSo, $T_2(f_2) = 9f_2 = 0f_1+9f_2$.

This integer is your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction of two distinct Hecke eigenforms in the space of cusp forms $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$ that are congruent modulo the prime $\\ell = 2$. The solution must also include a derivation of the Sturm bound for this space and use it to verify the congruence. The final answer is the value of this Sturm bound.\n\nFirst, we analyze the structure of the space of cusp forms $S_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$ for the given parameters $k=2$ and $N=11$. The dimension of this space, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$, is a fundamental quantity. For weight $k=2$, the dimension is equal to the genus of the modular curve $X_0(N)$. Thus, we compute the genus of $X_0(11)$.\n\nThe genus $g$ of $X_0(N)$ is given by the formula:\n$$g = 1 + \\frac{\\mu_N}{12} - \\frac{\\nu_2}{4} - \\frac{\\nu_3}{3} - \\frac{\\nu_{\\infty}}{2}$$\nwhere:\n- $\\mu_N = [\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)]$ is the index of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ in the full modular group $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The formula for this index is $\\mu_N = N \\prod_{p \\mid N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$. For the prime $N=11$, we have $\\mu_{11} = 11 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{11}\\right) = 11 \\cdot \\frac{12}{11} = 12$.\n- $\\nu_2$ is the number of elliptic points of order $2$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$. For $N=11$, which is a prime greater than $3$, this is given by $\\nu_2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{11}\\right)$, where $\\left(\\frac{\\cdot}{\\cdot}\\right)$ is the Legendre symbol. Since $11 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, we have $\\left(\\frac{-1}{11}\\right) = -1$. Thus, $\\nu_2 = 1 + (-1) = 0$.\n- $\\nu_3$ is the number of elliptic points of order $3$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$. For $N=11$, this is $\\nu_3 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{-3}{11}\\right)$. We calculate the Legendre symbol: $\\left(\\frac{-3}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{11}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right) = (-1) \\cdot \\left(-\\left(\\frac{11}{3}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{11}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -1$. Therefore, $\\nu_3 = 1 + (-1) = 0$.\n- $\\nu_{\\infty}$ is the number of cusps of $\\Gamma_0(N)$. For a prime $N$, there are always two cusps, represented by $0$ and $\\infty$. So, $\\nu_{\\infty} = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the genus formula:\n$$g = 1 + \\frac{12}{12} - \\frac{0}{4} - \\frac{0}{3} - \\frac{2}{2} = 1 + 1 - 0 - 0 - 1 = 1$$\nSo, the dimension of the space is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_2(\\Gamma_0(11)) = 1$.\n\nA one-dimensional vector space has the property that any non-zero vector is an eigenvector of any linear operator on that space. The Hecke operators $T_n$ are linear operators on $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$. Therefore, any non-zero form $f \\in S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$ is a Hecke eigenform. This is consistent with the problem's definition, which only requires $f \\neq 0$ and $a_1(f) \\neq 0$.\n\nSince $N=11$ is prime, the space $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$ contains no oldforms, so $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11)) = S_2^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(11))$. By the theory of newforms, this space has a basis of normalized Hecke eigenforms (with $a_1=1$). Since the dimension is $1$, there is a unique normalized Hecke eigenform, let us call it $f$. The Fourier coefficients of this newform, $a_n(f)$, are integers and the coefficient field is $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its $q$-expansion begins:\n$$f(q) = q - 2q^2 - q^3 + 2q^4 + q^5 + 2q^6 - 2q^7 - 2q^9 + O(q^{10})$$\nThis form satisfies the definition of a Hecke eigenform with $a_1(f)=1 \\neq 0$.\n\nTo find a second, distinct Hecke eigenform $g$, we can take any scalar multiple of $f$, say $g = c \\cdot f$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with $c \\neq 0$ and $c \\neq 1$. For the notion of congruence modulo $2$ to be meaningful, the Fourier coefficients of both forms should lie in a number ring where reduction modulo a prime ideal above $2$ is defined. The simplest choice is to have coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $f$ has integer coefficients, we can choose $c$ to be an integer.\n\nLet $g = c \\cdot f$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $c \\neq 0, 1$. Then $g$ is in $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$, is distinct from $f$, and is also a Hecke eigenform since $T_n(g) = T_n(cf) = c T_n(f) = c (\\lambda_n f) = \\lambda_n(cf) = \\lambda_n g$ for the same eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$. The first coefficient is $a_1(g) = c \\cdot a_1(f) = c \\cdot 1 = c$, which is non-zero.\n\nThe condition for congruence modulo $\\ell=2$ is that the Fourier coefficients are termwise congruent. The Fourier coefficients of $f$ and $g$ reside in the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, so reduction modulo $2$ is the standard operation in $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. We require $a_n(f) \\equiv a_n(g) \\pmod 2$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\nSubstituting $a_n(g) = c \\cdot a_n(f)$, the condition is $a_n(f) \\equiv c \\cdot a_n(f) \\pmod 2$, which can be rewritten as $(1-c) a_n(f) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nSince $a_1(f)=1$, this implies that $1-c$ must be divisible by $2$. Thus, $c$ must be an odd integer. To ensure $f$ and $g$ are distinct, we must have $c \\neq 1$. A simple choice is $c=3$.\n\nSo, we have our explicit example:\n1. $f(q) = \\sum a_n(f) q^n = q - 2q^2 - q^3 + \\dots$\n2. $g(q) = 3f(q) = \\sum (3a_n(f)) q^n = 3q - 6q^2 - 3q^3 + \\dots$\n\nThese are two distinct Hecke eigenforms in $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$. They are congruent modulo $2$ because for any integer $m=a_n(f)$, we have $m \\equiv 3m \\pmod 2$, as $m - 3m = -2m$ is always even.\n\nNext, we derive the Sturm bound, which specifies the number of Fourier coefficients that must be checked to guarantee a congruence. The general Sturm's theorem for congruences states that two modular forms $f, g \\in M_k(\\Gamma)$ with coefficients in a number ring are congruent modulo a prime ideal if their Fourier coefficients agree up to index $n_0 = \\frac{k}{12}[\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma]$.\nFor our problem, $k=2$ and $\\Gamma = \\Gamma_0(11)$. The index $[\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(11)]$ was calculated earlier as $\\mu_{11}=12$.\nPlugging these values into the formula for the Sturm bound gives:\n$$n_0 = \\frac{2}{12} \\cdot [\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(11)] = \\frac{2}{12} \\cdot 12 = 2$$\nThe Sturm bound for $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$ is $2$.\n\nFinally, we verify the congruence for our constructed forms $f$ and $g=3f$ up to this bound. We need to check the coefficients for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n- For $n=1$: $a_1(f) = 1$ and $a_1(g) = 3$. We check $1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$, which is true.\n- For $n=2$: $a_2(f) = -2$ and $a_2(g) = -6$. We check $-2 \\equiv -6 \\pmod 2$. Since both are congruent to $0 \\pmod 2$, this is also true.\nThe congruence holds for all coefficients up to the Sturm bound, which, by Sturm's theorem, guarantees that $f \\equiv g \\pmod 2$. This completes the verification.\n\nThe problem asks for the Sturm bound for $S_2(\\Gamma_0(11))$ as the final answer. This value is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3023948"}]}
