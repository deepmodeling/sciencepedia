No rounding is needed.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the dimension of the space of cusp forms $S_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$ for level $N=11$ and weight $k=12$. The problem specifies that this determination should start from foundational facts within the Riemann-Hurwitz and Riemann-Roch framework for the modular curve $X_0(N)$. Modular forms of weight $k$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with trivial nebentypus can be interpreted as global sections of a specific line bundle on the compact Riemann surface $X_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash(\\mathbb{H}\\cup\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{Q}))$. The dimension of such spaces of sections can be computed using formulae derived from the Riemann-Roch theorem.\n\nFor an even integer weight $k \\geq 2$, the dimension of the space of modular forms $M_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$ is related to the dimension of the space of cusp forms $S_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$ by the formula $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} M_k(\\Gamma_0(N)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_k(\\Gamma_0(N)) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} E_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$, where $E_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$ is the space of Eisenstein series. For $k > 2$ and trivial nebentypus, the dimension of the space of Eisenstein series is equal to the number of cusps of $\\Gamma_0(N)$, denoted by $\\nu_\\infty(N)$.\n\nThe dimension of the space of cusp forms for an even weight $k > 2$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_k(\\Gamma_0(N)) = (k-1)(g - 1) + \\left(\\frac{k}{2} - 1\\right)\\nu_\\infty(N) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\nu_2(N) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\nu_3(N) $$\nIf $k=2$, the dimension is simply $g$. The genus $g$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ is determined by the formula:\n$$ g(X_0(N)) = 1 + \\frac{\\mu_N}{12} - \\frac{\\nu_2(N)}{4} - \\frac{\\nu_3(N)}{3} - \\frac{\\nu_\\infty(N)}{2} $$\nIn these formulae, $\\mu_N = [\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)]$ is the index of the congruence subgroup, $\\nu_2(N)$ and $\\nu_3(N)$ are the number of $\\Gamma_0(N)$-inequivalent elliptic points of order $2$ and $3$ respectively, and $\\nu_\\infty(N)$ is the number of cusps.\n\nWe proceed by computing these four quantities for the given level $N=11$.\n1.  **Index $\\mu_{11}$**: For any prime level $N$, the index of $\\Gamma_0(N)$ in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is given by $\\mu_N = N+1$. For $N=11$, we have $\\mu_{11} = 11+1 = 12$.\n\n2.  **Number of Cusps $\\nu_\\infty(11)$**: The cusps of $\\Gamma_0(N)$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the positive divisors of $N$. For a prime level $N=11$, the divisors are $1$ and $11$. Thus, there are two cusps. We have $\\nu_\\infty(11) = 2$.\n\n3.  **Number of Elliptic Points of Order 2, $\\nu_2(11)$**: The group $\\Gamma_0(N)$ has elliptic points of order $2$ if and only if there exists an element in $\\Gamma_0(N)$ conjugate in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This condition is equivalent to the existence of an integer solution to the congruence $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{N}$. For $N=11$, we test if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $11$ by computing the Legendre symbol:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{-1}{11}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{11-1}{2}} = (-1)^5 = -1 $$\nSince the result is $-1$, $-1$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, and the congruence has no solutions. Therefore, there are no elliptic points of order $2$, so $\\nu_2(11) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Number of Elliptic Points of Order 3, $\\nu_3(11)$**: Similarly, $\\Gamma_0(N)$ has elliptic points of order $3$ if and only if the congruence $x^2+x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$ has a solution. This congruence is solvable if and only if its discriminant, $1^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3$, is a quadratic residue modulo $N$ (for $N>3$). For $N=11$, we compute the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{-3}{11})$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{-3}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{11}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right) $$\nWe already found $(\\frac{-1}{11}) = -1$. By the law of quadratic reciprocity:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{11}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{(3-1)(11-1)}{4}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) (-1)^5 = (-1)(-1) = 1 $$\nCombining these, we get $(\\frac{-3}{11}) = (-1)(1) = -1$. Since $-3$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, the congruence has no solutions. Therefore, there are no elliptic points of order $3$, so $\\nu_3(11) = 0$.\n\nNow, we compute the genus of $X_0(11)$ using the values $\\mu_{11}=12$, $\\nu_\\infty(11)=2$, $\\nu_2(11)=0$, and $\\nu_3(11)=0$:\n$$ g(X_0(11)) = 1 + \\frac{12}{12} - \\frac{0}{4} - \\frac{0}{3} - \\frac{2}{2} = 1 + 1 - 0 - 0 - 1 = 1 $$\nThe modular curve $X_0(11)$ has genus $1$, meaning it is an elliptic curve.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimension of the space of cusp forms $S_{12}(\\Gamma_0(11))$. The weight is $k=12$, which is an even integer greater than $2$. We substitute all our computed values into the dimension formula:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_{12}(\\Gamma_0(11)) = (12-1)(1 - 1) + \\left(\\frac{12}{2} - 1\\right)(2) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{12}{4} \\right\\rfloor(0) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{12}{3} \\right\\rfloor(0) $$\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_{12}(\\Gamma_0(11)) = (11)(0) + (6 - 1)(2) + (3)(0) + (4)(0) $$\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_{12}(\\Gamma_0(11)) = 0 + (5)(2) + 0 + 0 = 10 $$\nThe dimension of the space of cusp forms of weight $12$ at level $11$ is $10$. For completeness, the dimension of the full space of modular forms is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} M_{12}(\\Gamma_0(11)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} S_{12}(\\Gamma_0(11)) + \\nu_\\infty(11) = 10 + 2 = 12$.

Degeneracy Maps and Dimension of the $p$-old Subspace**\n\nLet $N$ be an integer, and let $p$ be a prime such that $p|N$ and $p^2 \\nmid N$. Let $M=N/p$. The $p$-old subspace of $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(N))$ is spanned by the images of forms in $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$ under two degeneracy maps. Let $f \\in S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$ have the $q$-expansion $f(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n q^n$, where $q = \\exp(2\\pi i z)$.\nThe two degeneracy maps, $j_1, j_p: S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M)) \\to S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(N))$, are given by:\n1. $j_1(f)(z) = f(z)$. The $q$-expansion of $j_1(f)$ is $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n q^n$. This is a modular form of level $N$ because $\\Gamma_{0}(N) \\subset \\Gamma_{0}(M)$.\n2. $j_p(f)(z) = f(pz)$. The $q$-expansion of $j_p(f)$ is $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n q^{pn}$. It is a standard result that this is a modular form of level $N=pM$.\n\nThe problem requires us to show that for a cusp form $f \\neq 0$, the images $j_1(f)$ and $j_p(f)$ are linearly independent.\nSuppose there exist constants $c_1, c_p \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $c_1 j_1(f) + c_p j_p(f) = 0$. In terms of $q$-expansions, this is:\n$$c_1 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n q^n + c_p \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n q^{pn} = 0$$\nThis is an identity of power series in $q$. For a non-zero form $f \\in S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$, there must be some non-zero Fourier coefficients. Since $p \\nmid M$, a fundamental result in the theory of modular forms states that any non-zero $f \\in S_k(\\Gamma_0(M))$ cannot have $a_n=0$ for all $n$ such that $p \\nmid n$.\nTherefore, there must exist an integer $n_0 \\ge 1$ such that $p \\nmid n_0$ and $a_{n_0} \\neq 0$.\nLet's consider the coefficient of $q^{n_0}$ in the linear combination. The term $\\sum a_n q^{pn}$ has non-zero coefficients only for exponents that are multiples of $p$. Since $p \\nmid n_0$, the coefficient of $q^{n_0}$ in the sum is simply $c_1 a_{n_0}$. For the sum to be zero, this coefficient must be zero: $c_1 a_{n_0} = 0$. Since $a_{n_0} \\neq 0$, we must have $c_1=0$.\nThe equation then reduces to $c_p j_p(f) = 0$. As $f$ is not the zero form, $j_p(f)(z) = f(pz)$ is also not the zero form. Therefore, we must have $c_p=0$.\nSince $c_1=0$ and $c_p=0$, the forms $j_1(f)$ and $j_p(f)$ are linearly independent.\n\nThe $p$-old subspace is defined as $S_{2, p-old}(\\Gamma_0(N)) = \\mathrm{Im}(j_1) + \\mathrm{Im}(j_p)$.\nThe dimension of this subspace is given by:\n$\\dim(S_{2, p-old}(\\Gamma_0(N))) = \\dim(\\mathrm{Im}(j_1)) + \\dim(\\mathrm{Im}(j_p)) - \\dim(\\mathrm{Im}(j_1) \\cap \\mathrm{Im}(j_p))$.\nThe maps $j_1$ and $j_p$ are injective on $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$, so $\\dim(\\mathrm{Im}(j_1)) = \\dim(\\mathrm{Im}(j_p)) = \\dim S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$.\nAn element $h$ in the intersection $\\mathrm{Im}(j_1) \\cap \\mathrm{Im}(j_p)$ can be written as $h=j_1(f_1)$ and $h=j_p(f_2)$ for some $f_1, f_2 \\in S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$. This means $f_1(z) = f_2(pz)$. The $q$-expansion of $f_1$ is $\\sum b_n q^n$, while that of $f_2(pz)$ is $\\sum c_n q^{pn}$. This implies that for $f_1$, its Fourier coefficients $b_n$ can be non-zero only if $p|n$. As argued before, for a cusp form in $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$ with $p \\nmid M$, this is only possible if the form is the zero form. Thus, $f_1=0$, which implies $h=0$.\nThe intersection is trivial, $\\mathrm{Im}(j_1) \\cap \\mathrm{Im}(j_p) = \\{0\\}$, so its dimension is $0$.\nWe conclude that the dimension of the $p$-old subspace is:\n$$\\dim S_{2, p-old}(\\Gamma_0(N)) = 2 \\cdot \\dim S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(M)) = 2 \\cdot \\dim S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(N/p))$$\n\n**3.

We will show that the newform $g \\in S_{k}^{\\mathrm{new}}(\\Gamma_{0}(20))$ is orthogonal to the entire subspace $W$.\n\nThe subspace $W$ is spanned by forms of the type $h=V_{d}f$, where $f$ is a normalized Hecke newform in $S_{k}^{\\mathrm{new}}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$ for some $M \\in \\{4,5,10\\}$ and $d$ is a divisor of $20/M$. By the linearity of the Petersson inner product, it suffices to show that $\\langle g, h \\rangle = 0$ for any such spanning form $h$.\n\nLet $g \\in S_{k}^{\\mathrm{new}}(\\Gamma_{0}(20))$ be a normalized newform. It is a simultaneous eigenform for all Hecke operators $T_{\\ell}$ acting on $S_{k}(\\Gamma_{0}(20))$:\n$$ T_{\\ell}g = a_{\\ell}(g)g $$\nfor all primes $\\ell$, where $a_{\\ell}(g)$ are the Hecke eigenvalues.\n\nLet $h = (V_{d}f)(z) = f(dz)$, where $f \\in S_{k}^{\\mathrm{new}}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$ is a normalized newform of level $M \\in \\{4,5,10\\}$ and $d \\mid (20/M)$. As a newform of level $M$, $f$ is an eigenform for the Hecke operators $T_{\\ell}^{(M)}$ on $S_{k}(\\Gamma_{0}(M))$:\n$$ T_{\\ell}^{(M)}f = a_{\\ell}(f)f. $$\n\nNow consider the action of the Hecke operator $T_{\\ell}$ on $S_{k}(\\Gamma_{0}(20))$ on the form $h$. For any prime $\\ell$ such that $\\gcd(\\ell, 20)=1$, we also have $\\gcd(\\ell, M)=1$ and $\\gcd(\\ell, d)=1$. The problem states that for such $\\ell$, $T_{\\ell}$ commutes with $V_d$. More precisely, $T_{\\ell}^{(20)} \\circ V_d = V_d \\circ T_{\\ell}^{(M)}$. Thus,\n$$ T_{\\ell}h = T_{\\ell}(V_{d}f) = V_{d}(T_{\\ell}^{(M)}f) = V_{d}(a_{\\ell}(f)f) = a_{\\ell}(f)(V_{d}f) = a_{\\ell}(f)h. $$\nThis shows that $h$ is also a Hecke eigenform for $T_{\\ell}$ with eigenvalue $a_{\\ell}(f)$ for all primes $\\ell$ with $\\gcd(\\ell, 20)=1$.\n\nThe Hecke operators $T_{\\ell}$ for $\\gcd(\\ell, 20)=1$ are self-adjoint with respect to the Petersson inner product on $S_{k}(\\Gamma_{0}(20))$. We have:\n$$ \\langle T_{\\ell}g, h \\rangle = \\langle g, T_{\\ell}h \\rangle. $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the actions of $T_{\\ell}$:\n$$ \\langle a_{\\ell}(g)g, h \\rangle = \\langle g, a_{\\ell}(f)h \\rangle. $$\nThe eigenvalues of normalized newforms are real algebraic integers, so they are their own complex conjugates.\n$$ a_{\\ell}(g) \\langle g, h \\rangle = a_{\\ell}(f) \\langle g, h \\rangle. $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ (a_{\\ell}(g) - a_{\\ell}(f)) \\langle g, h \\rangle = 0. $$\nThis equation holds for all primes $\\ell$ not dividing $20$.\n\nWe must now consider two cases.\nCase 1: There exists at least one prime $\\ell_{0}$ with $\\gcd(\\ell_{0}, 20)=1$ such that $a_{\\ell_{0}}(g) \\neq a_{\\ell_{0}}(f)$. In this case, the factor $(a_{\\ell_{0}}(g) - a_{\\ell_{0}}(f))$ is non-zero, which forces the other factor to be zero: $\\langle g, h \\rangle = 0$.\n\nCase 2: For all primes $\\ell$ with $\\gcd(\\ell, 20)=1$, we have $a_{\\ell}(g) = a_{\\ell}(f)$. The strong multiplicity-one theorem for newforms states that if two normalized newforms have the same Hecke eigenvalues for almost all primes, then they must be the same newform, and in particular, must have the same level. Here, $g$ is a newform of level $20$, and $f$ is a newform of level $M \\in \\{4, 5, 10\\}$. If this case held, the theorem would imply $20 = M$. However, $M$ is a proper divisor of $20$, so $M \\neq 20$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\nWe are forced into Case 1. Thus, for any spanning form $h \\in W$, we must have $\\langle g, h \\rangle = 0$.\nSince any element of $W$ is a linear combination of such spanning forms, it follows by linearity of the inner product that $g$ is orthogonal to every element of $W$. That is, $g \\in W^{\\perp}$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\langle g, P_{\\mathrm{old}}g \\rangle$. The operator $P_{\\mathrm{old}}$ is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace $W$. By definition of a projection operator, the image of any vector under $P_{\\mathrm{old}}$ must lie within the subspace $W$. So, $P_{\\mathrm{old}}g \\in W$.\nSince $g$ is orthogonal to every element in $W$, and $P_{\\mathrm{old}}g$ is an element of $W$, we must have:\n$$ \\langle g, P_{\\mathrm{old}}g \\rangle = 0. $$\nThe value of the Petersson inner product is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3019338"}]}
