By definition, $f$ is a simultaneous eigenvector for all Hecke operators $T_n$, and being normalized means its first Fourier coefficient is $a_1=1$. The eigenvalue equation is given as $T_n f = a_n f$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe problem provides the Hecke algebra relation for a prime $p$ and an integer $r \\ge 1$:\n$$T_p T_{p^r} = T_{p^{r+1}} + p^{k-1} T_{p^{r-1}}$$\nThis relation holds for operators acting on the space $S_k(\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$. We can apply both sides of this operator identity to the eigenform $f$.\n\nLet's evaluate the action of the left-hand side (LHS) on $f$:\n$$T_p T_{p^r} f = T_p(T_{p^r} f)$$\nSince $f$ is an eigenform of $T_{p^r}$ with eigenvalue $a_{p^r}$, this becomes:\n$$T_p(a_{p^r} f) = a_{p^r} (T_p f)$$\nNow, since $f$ is also an eigenform of $T_p$ with eigenvalue $a_p$, we have:\n$$a_{p^r}(a_p f) = a_p a_{p^r} f$$\n\nNext, let's evaluate the action of the right-hand side (RHS) on $f$:\n$$(T_{p^{r+1}} + p^{k-1} T_{p^{r-1}})f = T_{p^{r+1}}f + p^{k-1} T_{p^{r-1}}f$$\nUsing the eigenvalue property for $T_{p^{r+1}}$ and $T_{p^{r-1}}$, this becomes:\n$$a_{p^{r+1}}f + p^{k-1} a_{p^{r-1}}f = (a_{p^{r+1}} + p^{k-1} a_{p^{r-1}})f$$\n\nEquating the results from the LHS and RHS acting on $f$:\n$$a_p a_{p^r} f = (a_{p^{r+1}} + p^{k-1} a_{p^{r-1}})f$$\nSince $f$ is a cusp form, it is not the zero function, so we can equate the scalar coefficients:\n$$a_p a_{p^r} = a_{p^{r+1}} + p^{k-1} a_{p^{r-1}}$$\nThis gives a general recurrence relation for the Fourier coefficients of a normalized Hecke eigenform.\n\nThe problem asks for the specific recurrence connecting $a_{p^2}$ and $a_p$. We can obtain this by setting $r=1$ in the general recurrence relation:\n$$a_p a_{p^1} = a_{p^{1+1}} + p^{k-1} a_{p^{1-1}}$$\n$$a_p a_p = a_{p^2} + p^{k-1} a_{p^0}$$\nThe coefficient $a_{p^0} = a_1$. Since the eigenform $f$ is normalized, we have $a_1=1$.\n$$a_p^2 = a_{p^2} + p^{k-1} (1)$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $a_{p^2}$, we get the desired \"prime-square\" recurrence relation:\n$$a_{p^2} = a_p^2 - p^{k-1}$$\nFor the Ramanujan cusp form $\\Delta(z)$, the weight is $k=12$. Specializing the formula for $k=12$ yields:\n$$a_{p^2} = a_p^2 - p^{12-1} = a_p^2 - p^{11}$$\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Ramanujan cusp form $\\Delta(z)$**\n\nThe Ramanujan cusp form $\\Delta(z) \\in S_{12}(\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$ is the unique normalized Hecke eigenform of weight $k=12$. Its Fourier coefficients are denoted by the Ramanujan tau function, $\\tau(n)$, so $a_n = \\tau(n)$. The $q$-expansion of $\\Delta(z)$ begins:\n$$\\Delta(z) = q + \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\tau(n) q^n = q - 24q^2 + 252q^3 - 1472q^4 + \\dots$$\nFrom this expansion, we can \"read off\" the coefficient $a_2$, which is $\\tau(2)$:\n$$a_2 = \\tau(2) = -24$$\n\nNow, we use the recurrence relation derived in Part 1 to compute $a_4$. Since $4=2^2$, we set the prime $p=2$:\n$$a_{2^2} = a_2^2 - 2^{12-1}$$\n$$a_4 = a_2^2 - 2^{11}$$\nSubstituting the value $a_2 = -24$:\n$$a_4 = (-24)^2 - 2^{11}$$\nWe compute the two terms:\n$$(-24)^2 = 576$$\n$$2^{11} = 2 \\times 2^{10} = 2 \\times 1024 = 2048$$\nSubstituting these values back into the equation for $a_4$:\n$$a_4 = 576 - 2048 = -1472$$\nThus, the computed value for $a_4$ is $-1472$.\n\nThe problem asks to verify this result with the known $q$-expansion. The coefficient of $q^4$ in the expansion of $\\Delta(z)$ is $\\tau(4)$, which is indeed $-1472$. Our computed value matches the known coefficient, which confirms the correctness of our derivation and calculation.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(a_2, a_4)$. We found $a_2 = -24$ and $a_4 = -1472$.

The forms are normalized: $\\langle f,f \\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle g,g \\rangle = 1$.\n\nAs a preliminary step, we must establish the orthogonality of $f$ and $g$. The problem statement lists this as a fact to be used, but it is a direct consequence of the self-adjointness of the Hecke operators, which we are also instructed to use. A derivation from first principles should demonstrate this connection. Since $f$ and $g$ are distinct newforms, their systems of eigenvalues are different. The problem states that $a_{7}(f) \\neq a_{7}(g)$. We use the operator $T_7$. Since $7 \\nmid N$, $T_7$ is self-adjoint.\nWe have:\n$$\n\\langle T_{7}f, g \\rangle = \\langle f, T_{7}g \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the eigenform property, we substitute $T_{7}f = a_{7}(f)f$ and $T_{7}g = a_{7}(g)g$:\n$$\n\\langle a_{7}(f)f, g \\rangle = \\langle f, a_{7}(g)g \\rangle\n$$\nBy the sesquilinearity of the inner product and the fact that the eigenvalues $a_7(f)=3$ and $a_7(g)=1$ are real, we can pull the scalars out:\n$$\na_{7}(f)\\langle f, g \\rangle = a_{7}(g)\\langle f, g \\rangle\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n(a_{7}(f) - a_{7}(g))\\langle f, g \\rangle = 0\n$$\nFrom the given values, $a_{7}(f) = 3$ and $a_{7}(g) = 1$, so $a_{7}(f) - a_{7}(g) = 3 - 1 = 2 \\neq 0$.
