Since $\\gamma_1^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$, we have $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$. To satisfy $c=pc'$, we must be able to find a matrix in $\\Gamma_0(N)$ whose lower-left entry is divisible by $p$.\nIf $p \\mid N$, then $N|c$ implies $p|c$, so this condition is automatically satisfiable.\nIf $p \\nmid N$, then $N|c$ and $p|c$ implies $pN|c$. We must show that there exists a matrix $\\gamma_1^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$ with $c$ divisible by $pN$. Such a matrix can always be constructed. For instance, choose $c=pN$. Since $\\gcd(1, pN)=1$, we can solve $a(1) - b(pN)=1$, giving for example $a=1, b=0$ and $d=1$. This matrix is not in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. We need $ad-bc=1$. For $c=pN$, we need to solve $ad-b(pN)=1$. Since $a$ can be chosen coprime to $pN$, its inverse $d$ modulo $pN$ exists. So we can find $\\gamma_1^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(pN) \\subset \\Gamma_0(N)$.\nWith such a $\\gamma_1^{-1}$, one can show that a corresponding $\\gamma_2 \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$ also exists.\nTherefore, all $p$ matrices $\\beta_j$ for $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, p-1\\}$ are in the double coset $\\mathcal{C}_p$ regardless of whether $p$ divides $N$.\n\nTest for $\\beta_\\infty = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\nThe equation $\\gamma_1^{-1}\\beta_\\infty = \\alpha_p\\gamma_2$ becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & p \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a' & b' \\\\ c' & d' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} ap & b \\\\ cp & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a' & b' \\\\ pc' & pd' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis requires $d = pd'$, which implies $p \\mid d$.\nWe need to determine if a matrix $\\gamma_1^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ exists in $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with the property $p \\mid d$. The conditions are $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$ and $ad-bc=1$.\n\nCase 1: $p \\nmid N$\nWe need $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$ and $p \\mid d$. The condition is $ad-bc=1$. Let $c=N$ and $d=pk$ for some integer $k$. We need to solve $a(pk) - b(N) = 1$. This is a linear Diophantine equation in $a,b$. A solution exists if $\\gcd(pk, N)=1$. Since $p \\nmid N$, we require $\\gcd(k,N)=1$. We can choose $k=1$. Then we need to solve $ap-bN=1$. Since $\\gcd(p,N)=1$, by the extended Euclidean algorithm, solutions for $a,b$ exist. Thus, we can find such a matrix $\\gamma_1^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$. This implies that $\\beta_\\infty$ is in the double coset $\\mathcal{C}_p$ when $p \\nmid N$.\nThe representatives are $\\{\\beta_j\\}_{j=0}^{p-1} \\cup \\{\\beta_\\infty\\}$, for a total of $p+1$ representatives, matching our index calculation.\n\nCase 2: $p \\mid N$\nThe condition $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$ implies $p \\mid c$. So we need to find $\\gamma_1^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$ with $p \\mid c$ and $p \\mid d$.\nIf $p \\mid c$ and $p \\mid d$, then $ad-bc$ must be divisible by $p$. However, the determinant must be $1$, $ad-bc=1$. Since $p$ is a prime, $p \\ge 2$, this leads to a contradiction ($1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$).\nThus, no such matrix $\\gamma_1^{-1}$ exists in $\\Gamma_0(N)$.

This curve has conductor $11$, and its existence and connection to $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$ is a consequence of the Modularity Theorem. The formula for the Hecke eigenvalues $a_{p} = p+1 - \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})$ is the Eichler-Shimura relation. All provided information is scientifically correct, consistent, and sufficient to solve the problem. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution. The space of cusp forms $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$ is a one-dimensional complex vector space. The problem states it is spanned by a unique normalized Hecke eigenform, let's call it $f(q) = \\sum_{n \\ge 1} a_{n} q^{n}$.\nThis single form $f$ constitutes an eigenbasis for the space $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(11))$ for all Hecke operators $T_{p}$ with $p \\nmid N$.\n\nThe task is to diagonalize the Hecke operator $T_{5}$ and compute its trace. Since $\\{f\\}$ is an eigenbasis for $T_{5}$, the action of $T_{5}$ on $f$ is given by:\n$$\nT_{5}(f) = a_{5}f\n$$\nwhere $a_{5}$ is the Hecke eigenvalue corresponding to the prime $p=5$.\nIn the basis $\\{f\\}$, the linear operator $T_{5}$ is represented by the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[a_{5}]$. This matrix is already diagonal.\n\nThe trace of a linear operator is defined as the sum of its eigenvalues, counted with their algebraic multiplicities. In this case, the space is one-dimensional, so there is only one eigenvalue, $a_{5}$. Therefore, the trace of $T_{5}$ is simply this eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(T_{5}) = a_{5}\n$$\nTo find the value of $a_{5}$, we use the provided relation connecting the Hecke eigenvalue to the number of points on the associated elliptic curve over a finite field. For a prime $p$ not dividing the level $N=11$, we have:\n$$\na_{p} = p+1 - \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})\n$$\nwhere $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})$ is the number of points on the elliptic curve $E$ when considered over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. For our case, $p=5$:\n$$\na_{5} = 5+1 - \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{5}) = 6 - \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{5})\n$$\nThe problem is now reduced to computing $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{5})$, the number of points on the curve $E$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{5}=\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The equation for $E$ is:\n$$\ny^{2}+y = x^{3}-x^{2}-10x-20\n$$\nWe must reduce the coefficients of this equation modulo $5$. Since $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and $20 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, the equation over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ simplifies to:\n$$\ny^{2}+y = x^{3}-x^{2}\n$$\nTo find the number of points, we count the pairs $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{5} \\times \\mathbb{F}_{5}$ that satisfy this equation, and then add $1$ for the point at infinity, $O$. We can iterate through each possible value of $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{5}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side, $C(x) = x^{3}-x^{2}$, for each $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{5}$:\n- For $x=0$: $C(0) = 0^{3} - 0^{2} = 0$. We need to solve $y^{2}+y = 0$. This factors as $y(y+1)=0$, giving solutions $y=0$ and $y=-1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. This gives two points: $(0,0)$ and $(0,4)$.\n- For $x=1$: $C(1) = 1^{3} - 1^{2} = 0$. The equation is again $y^{2}+y = 0$. The solutions are $y=0$ and $y=4$. This gives two points: $(1,0)$ and $(1,4)$.\n- For $x=2$: $C(2) = 2^{3} - 2^{2} = 8 - 4 = 4$. We need to solve $y^{2}+y = 4$, or $y^{2}+y-4=0 \\pmod{5}$, which is $y^{2}+y+1=0 \\pmod{5}$. We check values for $y$:\n    - $y=0: 0+0+1=1 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=1: 1+1+1=3 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=2: 4+2+1=7 \\equiv 2 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=3: 9+3+1=13 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=4: 16+4+1=21 \\equiv 1 \\not\\equiv 0$\n  There are no solutions for $y$.\n- For $x=3$: $C(3) = 3^{3} - 3^{2} = 27 - 9 = 18 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. We need to solve $y^{2}+y=3$, or $y^{2}+y-3=0 \\pmod{5}$, which is $y^{2}+y+2=0 \\pmod{5}$. We check values for $y$:\n    - $y=0: 0+0+2=2 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=1: 1+1+2=4 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=2: 4+2+2=8 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=3: 9+3+2=14 \\equiv 4 \\not\\equiv 0$\n    - $y=4: 16+4+2=22 \\equiv 2 \\not\\equiv 0$\n  There are no solutions for $y$.\n- For $x=4$: $C(4) = 4^{3} - 4^{2} \\equiv (-1)^{3} - (-1)^{2} = -1 - 1 = -2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. The equation is $y^{2}+y=3$, which we have just shown has no solutions.\n\nSummarizing the affine points $(x,y)$ on the curve:\n- For $x=0$, we have $2$ points: $(0,0), (0,4)$.\n- For $x=1$, we have $2$ points: $(1,0), (1,4)$.\n- For $x=2, 3, 4$, we have $0$ points.\n\nThe total number of affine points is $2+2 = 4$.\nThe total number of points on the elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ is the number of affine points plus the single point at infinity, $O$.\n$$\n\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{5}) = 4 + 1 = 5\n$$\nNow we can compute the eigenvalue $a_{5}$:\n$$\na_{5} = 6 - \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{5}) = 6 - 5 = 1\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Tr}(T_{5}) = a_{5}$, we have found the trace.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(T_{5}) = 1\n$$\nThe diagonalization of $T_{5}$ is thus given by the eigenbasis $\\{f\\}$ and the corresponding diagonal matrix representation of the operator, $[1]$. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, which is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3015507"}]}
