We proceed to solve it starting from the given definitions.\n\nLet $[M] \\in \\mathrm{Stab}_{PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}(i)$ be an element of the stabilizer subgroup of the point $i \\in \\mathbb{H}$. This element is an equivalence class of matrices in $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Let $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ be a representative of this class, where $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and the determinant is $\\det(M) = ad - bc = 1$.\n\nThe defining condition for an element of the stabilizer subgroup of $i$ is that the action of $M$ on $i$ leaves $i$ fixed:\n$$ \\frac{ai+b}{ci+d} = i $$\nTo solve for the integer coefficients $a,b,c,d$, we manipulate this equation. Multiplying both sides by $ci+d$ gives:\n$$ ai+b = i(ci+d) $$\n$$ ai+b = ci^2 + di $$\nSince $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ ai+b = -c + di $$\nThis is an equation in the complex numbers. Since $a, b, c, d$ are integers (and therefore real numbers), we can equate the real and imaginary parts of both sides of the equation.\n\nEquating the real parts:\n$$ b = -c $$\nEquating the imaginary parts:\n$$ a = d $$\nThese two conditions must hold for any matrix $M \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ that fixes the point $i$. Substituting these conditions into the general form of the matrix $M$, we find that it must have the structure:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{pmatrix} $$\nfor some integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nNext, we enforce the condition that $M \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, which means its determinant must be $1$.\n$$ \\det(M) = ad - bc = a(a) - b(-b) = a^2 + b^2=1 $$\nWe must find all integer solutions $(a,b)$ to the Diophantine equation $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $a^2$ and $b^2$ must be non-negative integers. The only way the sum of two non-negative integers can be $1$ is if one is $1$ and the other is $0$. This leads to four possible pairs for $(a, b)$:\n1. $a = 1, b = 0$\n2. $a = -1, b = 0$\n3. $a = 0, b = 1$\n4. $a = 0, b = -1$\n\nThese four solutions correspond to four distinct matrices in $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ that fix the point $i$:\n1. For $(a,b)=(1,0)$, we get $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n2. For $(a,b)=(-1,0)$, we get $M_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -I$.\n3.

In this group, an element is an equivalence class $[M] = \\{M, -M\\}$. We must therefore find the distinct equivalence classes corresponding to the four matrices we found.\n\n- The matrices $M_1 = I$ and $M_2 = -I$ are negatives of each other. They form a single equivalence class, $[I] = \\{I, -I\\}$. This is the identity element of the group $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n- The matrices $M_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $M_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ are also negatives of each other, since $-M_3 = -\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = M_4$. Thus, they form another single equivalence class, $[M_3] = \\{M_3, M_4\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the stabilizer subgroup $\\mathrm{Stab}_{PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}(i)$ consists of exactly two distinct elements: the class $[I]$ and the class $[M_3]$.\n\nThe order of a group is defined as the number of elements it contains.

Such an element is defined as hyperbolic if its trace, $\\operatorname{tr}(A) = a+d$, satisfies the condition $|\\operatorname{tr}(A)| > 2$.\n\nPart 1: Construction of a hyperbolic element\nWe need to find a matrix $A$ with integer coefficients, determinant $1$, and trace with absolute value greater than $2$. Let's choose simple integer values.\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe entries are all integers.\nThe determinant is $\\det(A) = (2)(1) - (1)(1) = 2 - 1 = 1$. So, $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe trace is $\\operatorname{tr}(A) = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nWe check the condition for being hyperbolic: $|\\operatorname{tr}(A)| = |3| = 3$. Since $3 > 2$, the condition is satisfied.\nThus, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is an explicit example of a hyperbolic element in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nPart 2: Verification for the given matrix\nWe are given the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFirst, we verify that $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The entries $4, 1, 3, 1$ are all integers. We calculate the determinant:\n$$ \\det(A) = (4)(1) - (1)(3) = 4 - 3 = 1 $$\nSince the determinant is $1$, $A$ is indeed an element of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nNext, we verify that $A$ is hyperbolic. We calculate the trace:\n$$ \\operatorname{tr}(A) = 4 + 1 = 5 $$\nWe check the condition $|\\operatorname{tr}(A)| > 2$:\n$$ |\\operatorname{tr}(A)| = |5| = 5 > 2 $$\nThe condition is satisfied, so the matrix $A$ is a hyperbolic element.\n\nPart 3: Derivation and solution for fixed points\nThe linear fractional transformation induced by $A$ is $g(z) = \\frac{4z+1}{3z+1}$. A fixed point of this transformation is a value $z$ such that $g(z) = z$.\n$$ z = \\frac{4z+1}{3z+1} $$\nAssuming $3z+1 \\neq 0$, we can multiply both sides by $(3z+1)$:\n$$ z(3z+1) = 4z+1 $$\n$$ 3z^2 + z = 4z+1 $$\nRearranging the terms gives the quadratic equation satisfied by the fixed points:\n$$ 3z^2 - 3z - 1 = 0 $$\nWe solve this equation using the quadratic formula $z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=3$, $b=-3$, and $c=-1$.\n$$ z = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(3)(-1)}}{2(3)} $$\n$$ z = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 12}}{6} $$\n$$ z = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{6} $$\nThe discriminant $21 > 0$, so there are two distinct real fixed points. As required by the problem, we label them such that $x_{-} < x_{+}$.\n$$ x_{-} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21}}{6} $$\n$$ x_{+} = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21}}{6} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{21} > 0$, it is clear that $x_{-} < x_{+}$.\n\nPart 4: Determination of the invariant geodesic\nA linear fractional transformation with real coefficients, such as $g(z) = \\frac{4z+1}{3z+1}$, maps the real axis $\\mathbb{R}$ (more precisely, the extended real line $\\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$) to itself. Consequently, it also maps the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ to itself.\nA hyperbolic geodesic in $\\mathbb{H}$ is uniquely specified by its two endpoints on the boundary $\\partial\\mathbb{H} = \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$.\nLet $\\gamma$ be the hyperbolic geodesic whose endpoints are the fixed points $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$.\nThe transformation $g$ maps geodesics to geodesics. The image of $\\gamma$ under $g$, denoted $g(\\gamma)$, is the geodesic whose endpoints are $g(x_{-})$ and $g(x_{+})$.\nBy definition, $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$ are fixed points of $g$, so $g(x_{-}) = x_{-}$ and $g(x_{+}) = x_{+}$.\nThis means that the endpoints of $g(\\gamma)$ are the same as the endpoints of $\\gamma$. Since a geodesic is uniquely determined by its endpoints, we must have $g(\\gamma) = \\gamma$. Thus, the geodesic with endpoints $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$ is invariant under the action of $A$.\nThe problem states that hyperbolic geodesics are either Euclidean semicircles orthogonal to the real axis or vertical lines. A vertical line has one endpoint at $\\infty$. Since our fixed points $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$ are both finite real numbers, the invariant geodesic must be a Euclidean semicircle. For a semicircle to be orthogonal to the real axis, its diameter must lie on the real axis. The endpoints of this diameter are $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$.\nThe Euclidean center $m$ of this semicircle must be the midpoint of the segment connecting $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$.\n$$ m = \\frac{x_{-} + x_{+}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21}}{6} + \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21}}{6} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21} + 3 + \\sqrt{21}}{6} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{6}{6} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe Euclidean radius $r$ of the semicircle is half the distance between the endpoints.\n$$ r = \\frac{x_{+} - x_{-}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21}}{6} - \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21}}{6} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21} - 3 + \\sqrt{21}}{6} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{21}}{6} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{6} $$\nThe four requested quantities are $x_{-}$, $x_{+}$, $m$, and $r$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21}}{6} & \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21}}{6} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{6} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3028062"}, {"introduction": "The power of the fundamental domain $F$ lies in its role as a complete set of representatives for the orbits of the modular group, meaning any point $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$ can be mapped into $F$ by some group element.
