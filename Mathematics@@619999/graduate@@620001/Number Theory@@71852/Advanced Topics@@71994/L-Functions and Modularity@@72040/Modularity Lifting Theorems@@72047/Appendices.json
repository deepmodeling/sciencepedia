I will address these in order.\n\nLet $p$ be an odd prime, $\\ell$ a rational prime with $\\ell \\neq p$, and let $\\bar{\\rho} \\colon G_{\\mathbf{Q}} \\to \\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbf{F}_{p})$ be a continuous, odd representation of the absolute Galois group $G_{\\mathbf{Q}} = \\mathrm{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}/\\mathbf{Q})$ of the field of rational numbers $\\mathbf{Q}$. The representation space is a two-dimensional vector space $V$ over the finite field $\\mathbf{F}_p$, which we can identify with $\\mathbf{F}_p^2$.\n\n**Part 1: Definition of the Artin Conductor**\n\nThe Artin conductor $N(\\bar{\\rho})$ is a positive integer that quantifies the ramification of the representation $\\bar{\\rho}$. It is defined as a product of local contributions, one for each rational prime $q$:\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}) = \\prod_{q} q^{n(\\bar{\\rho}, q)}$$\nwhere the product is taken over all finite primes $q$ of $\\mathbf{Q}$. The exponent $n(\\bar{\\rho}, q)$, an integer, is called the local Artin conductor exponent at $q$. Its value depends on the restriction of $\\bar{\\rho}$ to the decomposition group at $q$.\n\nTo define $n(\\bar{\\rho}, q)$, we fix a prime $q$ and consider the local Galois group $G_q = G_{\\mathbf{Q}_q} = \\mathrm{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}_q/\\mathbf{Q}_q)$, which is identified with the decomposition group at $q$ inside $G_{\\mathbf{Q}}$. The representation space is $V = \\mathbf{F}_p^2$.\n\nWithin $G_q$, we have the ramification filtration in the upper numbering, denoted by $\\{G_q^u\\}_{u \\ge -1}$. This is a family of normal subgroups of $G_q$ indexed by real numbers $u \\ge -1$. The key groups in this filtration are:\n- $G_q^{-1} = G_q$.\n- $G_q^0 = I_q$, the inertia subgroup of $G_q$.\n- For $u > 0$, the groups $G_q^u$ constitute the higher ramification groups. The union $\\bigcup_{u>0} G_q^u$ is a subgroup of $I_q$ which acts on the representation. The wild inertia subgroup $P_q$ is the unique Sylow $q$-subgroup of $I_q$, and it is related to the higher ramification groups $G_q^u$ for $u>0$.\n\nThe local conductor exponent $n(\\bar{\\rho}, q)$ is defined by the following formula, often called Serre's conductor formula:\n$$n(\\bar{\\rho}, q) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{|(G_q)_i|}{|(G_q)_0|} \\left(\\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V - \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V^{(G_q)_i}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\{(G_q)_i\\}_{i \\ge 0}$ is the ramification filtration in the lower numbering, and $V^H$ denotes the subspace of $V$ fixed by a subgroup $H \\subseteq G_q$.\n\nAs the problem requests the definition in terms of the upper numbering filtration, we use the equivalent formulation. The conductor exponent can be expressed as an integral:\n$$n(\\bar{\\rho}, q) = \\int_{-1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V - \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V^{G_q^u}\\right) du$$\nThis integral is interpreted as a sum over the jumps in the filtration. A more practical way to write this is to separate the contribution at $u=0$ (tame ramification) from the contribution for $u>0$ (wild ramification):\n$$n(\\bar{\\rho}, q) = \\left(\\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V - \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V^{I_q}\\right) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V - \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V^{G_q^u}\\right) du$$\nSince $V=\\mathbf{F}_p^2$, we have $\\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}V = 2$. The expression is:\n$$n(\\bar{\\rho}, q) = \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V^{I_q}) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V^{G_q^u}) du$$\nThe integral term is the sum of the codimensions of the fixed subspaces, weighted by the lengths of the intervals in the upper numbering where the ramification group is constant. Since the image of $\\bar{\\rho}$ is finite, for $u$ sufficiently large, $G_q^u$ acts trivially on $V$, making $V^{G_q^u}=V$ and ensuring the integral is finite.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $N(\\bar{\\rho})$**\n\nWe are given two additional hypotheses to compute the integer $N(\\bar{\\rho})$:\n1. $\\bar{\\rho}$ is unramified at every finite prime $q \\neq \\ell$.\n2. At $q=\\ell$, the restriction $\\bar{\\rho}|_{G_{\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}}}$ is tamely ramified with local conductor exponent equal to $1$.\n\nWe compute the local exponents $n(\\bar{\\rho}, q)$ for all primes $q$.\n\nCase 1: $q \\neq \\ell$.\nThe hypothesis states that $\\bar{\\rho}$ is unramified at $q$. By definition, this means the inertia group $I_q$ acts trivially on the representation space $V$. That is, $\\bar{\\rho}(g) = \\mathrm{Id}$ for all $g \\in I_q$. This implies $V^{I_q} = V$. Since $G_q^u \\subseteq I_q$ for all $u \\ge 0$, these higher ramification groups must also act trivially. Thus, $V^{G_q^u} = V$ for all $u \\ge 0$.\nUsing the formula for the local conductor exponent:\n$$n(\\bar{\\rho}, q) = \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V^{I_q}) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V^{G_q^u}) du$$\n$$n(\\bar{\\rho}, q) = \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V) du = 0 + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 0 \\, du = 0$$\nSo, for all primes $q \\neq \\ell$, the local exponent is $n(\\bar{\\rho}, q) = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $q = \\ell$.\nThe hypothesis explicitly states that the local conductor exponent at $q=\\ell$ is $1$.\nTherefore, $n(\\bar{\\rho}, \\ell) = 1$.\nThe additional information that the representation is \"tamely ramified\" at $\\ell$ is consistent with this value. Tame ramification means that the wild inertia subgroup $P_\\ell$ acts trivially on $V$. In the upper numbering filtration, this means $G_\\ell^u$ acts trivially for all $u > 0$. Consequently, $V^{G_\\ell^u}=V$ for all $u>0$, and the wild contribution to the conductor is $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\dim(V/V^{G_\\ell^u}) du = 0$. The conductor exponent is then solely determined by the action of the inertia group, $n(\\bar{\\rho}, \\ell) = \\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V^{I_\\ell})$. The hypothesis $n(\\bar{\\rho}, \\ell)=1$ thus implies that $\\dim_{\\mathbf{F}_p}(V/V^{I_\\ell})=1$, meaning the space of vectors fixed by inertia, $V^{I_\\ell}$, has dimension $1$. All given information is consistent.\n\nNow we can assemble the global Artin conductor $N(\\bar{\\rho})$:\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}) = \\prod_{q} q^{n(\\bar{\\rho}, q)}$$\nWe substitute the local exponents we have determined:\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}) = \\ell^{n(\\bar{\\rho}, \\ell)} \\cdot \\prod_{q \\neq \\ell} q^{n(\\bar{\\rho}, q)}$$\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}) = \\ell^{1} \\cdot \\prod_{q \\neq \\ell} q^{0}$$\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}) = \\ell \\cdot \\prod_{q \\neq \\ell} 1$$\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}) = \\ell$$\n\nThe Artin conductor of the representation $\\bar{\\rho}$ is the prime $\\ell$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\ell}$$", "id": "3018634"}, {"introduction": "The discovery of congruences between the Fourier coefficients of distinct newforms was a key breakthrough, suggesting a deep underlying structure.

The provided data for the Fourier coefficients of the newforms $f$ and $g$ are consistent with the properties of newforms of level $N=26$. Specifically, for a prime $q$ exactly dividing the level $N$ (i.e., $q \\mid N$ and $q^2 \\nmid N$), the Fourier coefficients of a newform $h$ satisfy $a_{q^r}(h) = (a_q(h))^r$. For $N=26$, the prime divisors are $q=2$ and $q=13$. We can check this property for $f$ with $q=2$ and $r=2$. The coefficient $a_4(f)$ should be equal to $(a_2(f))^2$. We are given $a_2(f)=-1$ and $a_4(f)=1$. Indeed, $(-1)^2=1$. Similarly for $g$, $a_2(g)=-1$ and $a_4(g)=1$, which is consistent. The multiplicative property $a_{mn}(h)=a_m(h)a_n(h)$ for $\\gcd(m,n)=1$ can be checked for $n=6$. For $f$, $a_6(f) = a_2(f)a_3(f) = (-1)(1) = -1$, which matches the given data. For $g$, $a_6(g) = a_2(g)a_3(g) = (-1)(1) = -1$, which also matches. The problem is therefore valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two tasks as requested.\n\n**Task 1: Compute the Sturm bound and the congruence prime**\n\nFirst, we compute the Sturm bound $B$ for the space of cusp forms $S_{k}(\\Gamma_{0}(N))$ with weight $k=2$ and level $N=26$. The formula for the Sturm bound is:\n$$B = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{12} [\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}):\\Gamma_{0}(N)] \\right\\rfloor$$\nWe need to calculate the index of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_{0}(N)$ in the full modular group $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$. The formula for this index is:\n$$[\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}):\\Gamma_{0}(N)] = N \\prod_{q \\mid N} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{q}\\right)$$\nwhere the product is over the distinct prime divisors of $N$. For $N=26$, the prime divisors are $q=2$ and $q=13$. Plugging these values into the formula:\n$$[\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z}):\\Gamma_{0}(26)] = 26 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{13}\\right) = 26 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{14}{13} = \\frac{26 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 14}{26} = 42$$\nNow, we substitute this index and the weight $k=2$ into the Sturm bound formula:\n$$B = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{12} \\cdot 42 \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 42 \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 7 \\rfloor = 7$$\nThe Sturm bound is $B=7$. This means that if two modular forms in $S_{2}(\\Gamma_{0}(26))$ have Fourier coefficients that are congruent modulo a prime $p$ for all indices $n$ from $1$ to $7$, then all their Fourier coefficients are congruent modulo $p$.\n\nNext, we seek a prime $p$ for which $a_{n}(f) \\equiv a_{n}(g) \\pmod{p}$ for all $n$ from $1$ to $7$. This requires that $p$ divides the difference $a_{n}(f) - a_{n}(g)$ for each $n$ in this range. Let's compute these differences using the given coefficients:\n- $n=1: a_{1}(f) - a_{1}(g) = 1 - 1 = 0$\n- $n=2: a_{2}(f) - a_{2}(g) = -1 - (-1) = 0$\n- $n=3: a_{3}(f) - a_{3}(g) = 1 - 1 = 0$\n- $n=4: a_{4}(f) - a_{4}(g) = 1 - 1 = 0$\n- $n=5: a_{5}(f) - a_{5}(g) = -3 - 2 = -5$\n- $n=6: a_{6}(f) - a_{6}(g) = -1 - (-1) = 0$\n- $n=7: a_{7}(f) - a_{7}(g) = 1 - (-4) = 5$\n\nFor the congruences to hold, the prime $p$ must divide all these differences. The non-zero differences are $-5$ and $5$. The only prime number that divides both $-5$ and $5$ is $p=5$.\nTherefore, for $p=5$, we have $a_{n}(f) \\equiv a_{n}(g) \\pmod{5}$ for all $1 \\le n \\le 7$. By the Sturm bound, this implies that $f$ and $g$ are congruent modulo $5$, i.e., $a_{n}(f) \\equiv a_{n}(g) \\pmod{5}$ for all $n \\ge 1$. Since $f$ and $g$ are Hecke eigenforms, their corresponding Hecke eigenvalues are also congruent modulo $5$. The prime is $p=5$.\n\n**Task 2: Identify the maximal ideal**\n\nThe congruence $f \\equiv g \\pmod{5}$ between two distinct normalized newforms gives rise to a maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ of the Hecke algebra $\\mathbb{T}$. This ideal is the kernel of the ring homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{F}_{5}$ which maps each Hecke operator to its eigenvalue modulo $5$. Since the eigenvalues of $f$ and $g$ are congruent modulo $5$, we can use either form to define this map. Let's use $f$:\n$$\\phi(T_{\\ell}) = a_{\\ell}(f) \\pmod{5} \\quad \\text{for primes } \\ell \\nmid 26$$\n$$\\phi(U_{q}) = a_{q}(f) \\pmod{5} \\quad \\text{for primes } q \\mid 26$$\nThe maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ is generated by $p=5$ and the elements $T - \\phi(T)$ for a set of generators $T$ of the Hecke algebra. We are asked to provide a generating set for $\\mathfrak{m}$ using the operators from {$T_3, T_5, T_7, U_2, U_{13}$} and the prime $p=5$. Note that for a newform in $S_k(\\Gamma_0(N))$, the Hecke operator corresponding to a prime $q \\mid N$ is the Atkin operator $U_q$, so the use of $U_2$ and $U_{13}$ is appropriate.\n\nWe compute the eigenvalues modulo $5$:\n- For $T_{3}$: $a_{3}(f) = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n- For $T_{5}$: $a_{5}(f) = -3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n- For $T_{7}$: $a_{7}(f) = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n- For $U_{2}$: $a_{2}(f) = -1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n- For $U_{13}$: $a_{13}(f) = -1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nThe maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m} = \\ker(\\phi)$ is therefore generated by the set:\n$$\\{5, T_3-1, T_5-2, T_7-1, U_2-4, U_{13}-4\\}$$\nThis set explicitly certifies the maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m} \\subset \\mathbb{T}$ associated with the congruence between $f$ and $g$.\n\nThe problem asks for the single prime $p$ determined in Task 1 as the final answer.

Therefore, $\\dim_E D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(E(\\psi))/\\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}}(E(\\psi)) = 1$ if $w < 0$, and $0$ if $w \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's apply this to our three characters:\n1.  For $V = E(1)$ (trivial character): The Hodge–Tate weight is $w=0$. The character is trivial, so $\\dim_E H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, E(1)) = 1$. Since $w=0 \\ge 0$, $\\dim_E D_{\\mathrm{dR}}/\\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}} = 0$.\n    Thus, $\\dim_E H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, E(1)) = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n2.  For $V = E(\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1})$: The Hodge–Tate weight is $w=-1$. The condition $\\bar{\\chi}_1|_{I_p} \\neq \\bar{\\chi}_2|_{I_p}$ implies that the character $\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1}$ is non-trivial. Hence, $\\dim_E H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, E(\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1})) = 0$. Since $w=-1 < 0$, $\\dim_E D_{\\mathrm{dR}}/\\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}} = 1$.\n    Thus, $\\dim_E H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, E(\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1})) = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n3.  For $V = E(\\chi_2\\chi_1^{-1})$: The Hodge–Tate weight is $w=1$. The character is non-trivial, so $\\dim_E H^0(\\mathbb{Q}_p, E(\\chi_2\\chi_1^{-1})) = 0$. Since $w=1 \\ge 0$, $\\dim_E D_{\\mathrm{dR}}/\\mathrm{Fil}^0 D_{\\mathrm{dR}} = 0$.\n    Thus, $\\dim_E H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, E(\\chi_2\\chi_1^{-1})) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nThe representation $\\mathrm{ad}^0\\rho$ sits in a pair of short exact sequences reflecting its filtration structure. Let $V_1 = E(\\chi_2\\chi_1^{-1})$, $V_2 = E(1)$, and $V_3 = E(\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1})$. The filtration gives rise to sequences like $0 \\to F_1 \\to \\mathrm{ad}^0\\rho \\to F_2 \\to 0$ where $F_1, F_2$ are extensions of the $V_i$. In this specific setting, the dimensions of the $H^1_f$ groups are additive. This can be shown by analyzing the long exact sequences in cohomology. The connecting homomorphisms are zero because the relevant $H^0$ and $H^2$ groups vanish. Specifically, for any representations $A, B, C$ fitting into a short exact sequence $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0$, we have a long exact sequence\n$$ \\dots \\to H^1_f(A) \\to H^1_f(B) \\to H^1_f(C) \\to H^2(A) \\to \\dots $$\nLocal Tate duality gives $\\dim H^2(V) = \\dim H^0(V^*(1))$. For the characters involved, $V_i^*(1)$ are non-trivial (as can be checked from their HT weights), so the $H^0$ groups vanish, which in turn implies the $H^2$ groups are zero. This forces the sequence for $H^1_f$ to be short exact, making the dimensions additive.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the cohomology of the full representation is the sum of the dimensions for its graded pieces:\n$$ \\dim_E H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, \\mathrm{ad}^0\\rho) = \\dim_E H^1_f(E(1)) + \\dim_E H^1_f(E(\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1})) + \\dim_E H^1_f(E(\\chi_2\\chi_1^{-1})) $$\n$$ \\dim_E H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, \\mathrm{ad}^0\\rho) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. $$\nThe problem states that $\\rho$ is a crystalline ordinary lift in the Fontaine–Laffaille range (Hodge–Tate weights $\\{0, 1\\}$ are within $\\{0, \\dots, p-2\\}$ for $p \\ge 5$). Under these conditions, and with the regularity condition $\\bar{\\chi}_1|_{I_p} \\neq \\bar{\\chi}_2|_{I_p}$, the dimension of the Bloch–Kato group is preserved under reduction modulo $p$. That is,\n$$ \\dim_k H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, \\mathrm{ad}^0\\bar{\\rho}) = \\dim_E H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, \\mathrm{ad}^0\\rho). $$\nThus, we conclude that the dimension of $H^1_f(\\mathbb{Q}_p, \\mathrm{ad}^0\\bar{\\rho})$ over $k$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3018611"}]}
