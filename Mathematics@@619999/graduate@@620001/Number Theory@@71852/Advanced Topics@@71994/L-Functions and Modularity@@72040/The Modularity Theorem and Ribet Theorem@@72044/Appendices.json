For our case, the representation is $\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}$ restricted to $G_{\\mathbb{Q}_\\ell}$, the vector space is $V = E[p]$, the group of $p$-torsion points of $E$, which is a $2$-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. The Galois group is $G_{\\mathbb{Q}_\\ell}$, its inertia subgroup is $I_\\ell = G_0$, and the wild inertia subgroup is $P_\\ell = G_1$.\n\nA key simplification arises from the fact that we are considering primes $\\ell \\neq p$. The ramification of the representation $\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}$ at such primes is tame. This means that the wild inertia subgroup $P_\\ell$ acts trivially. Consequently, all higher ramification groups $G_i$ for $i \\ge 1$ also act trivially. The formula for the conductor exponent then simplifies. Specifically, the Swan conductor, which measures wild ramification, is zero. The exponent is given entirely by the action of the inertia group $I_\\ell$:\n$$f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V/V^{I_\\ell}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V^{I_\\ell})$$\nSince $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V) = 2$, we have $f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = 2 - \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V^{I_\\ell})$. Our task reduces to determining the dimension of the subspace of $E[p]$ fixed by the inertia group $I_\\ell$ for each prime $\\ell \\neq p$. This dimension depends on the reduction type of $E$ at $\\ell$. Since $E$ is semistable, it has either good or multiplicative reduction at any prime $\\ell$.\n\nCase 1: $E$ has good reduction at $\\ell \\neq p$.\nThe conductor exponent of the curve is $f_{\\ell}(E) = 0$. By the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich (NOS) criterion, an elliptic curve has good reduction at $\\ell$ if and only if the $p$-adic Galois representation on its Tate module $T_p(E)$ is unramified at $\\ell$ for any prime $p \\neq \\ell$. Unramified means the inertia group $I_\\ell$ acts trivially on $T_p(E)$. The representation $\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}$ on $V = E[p]$ is the reduction modulo $p$ of the representation on $T_p(E)$. If $I_\\ell$ acts as the identity on $T_p(E)$, it must also act as the identity on $V = E[p] \\cong T_p(E)/pT_p(E)$. Therefore, for every vector $v \\in V$, we have $\\sigma(v) = v$ for all $\\sigma \\in I_\\ell$. This means the entire space $V$ is fixed by inertia, so $V^{I_\\ell} = V$. The dimension of the fixed subspace is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V^{I_\\ell}) = 2$.\nThe Artin conductor exponent is then:\n$$f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = 2 - \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V^{I_\\ell}) = 2 - 2 = 0$$\nThus, if $f_{\\ell}(E)=0$ (good reduction), then $f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p})=0$.\n\nCase 2: $E$ has multiplicative reduction at $\\ell \\neq p$.\nThe conductor exponent of the curve is $f_{\\ell}(E) = 1$. The problem specifies to use the known structure of local Galois inertia for semistable reduction. For a prime $\\ell \\neq p$ of multiplicative reduction, the action of the inertia group $I_\\ell$ on the Tate module $T_p(E)$ is tamely ramified and unipotent up to a twist. More precisely, there exists a basis of $T_p(E)$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to which the action of any $\\sigma \\in I_\\ell$ is given by a matrix of the form:\n$$\\rho_{E,p}(\\sigma) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\chi_p(\\sigma) & * \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is the $p$-adic cyclotomic character. Reducing this matrix modulo $p$, we obtain the matrix for the action of $\\sigma$ on $V=E[p]$ with respect to the corresponding basis over $\\mathbb{F}_p$:\n$$\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}(\\sigma) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma) & * \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$$\nwhere $\\bar{\\chi}_p$ is the mod $p$ cyclotomic character. We wish to find the dimension of the subspace $V^{I_\\ell}$ of vectors fixed by $I_\\ell$. Let $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ be such a vector. For it to be fixed by any $\\sigma \\in I_\\ell$, we must have $\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}(\\sigma)v = v$. This gives the system of equations:\n$1.$ $\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma)v_1 + (*)v_2 = v_1$\n$2.$ $v_2 = v_2$\nSince $\\ell \\neq p$, the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_\\ell(\\mu_p)/\\mathbb{Q}_\\ell$ is tamely ramified, and the character $\\bar{\\chi}_p: I_\\ell \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^\\times$ is non-trivial. Thus, we can choose an element $\\tau \\in I_\\ell$ such that $\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\tau) \\neq 1$. For this $\\tau$, the first equation becomes $(\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\tau) - 1)v_1 + (*)v_2 = 0$.\nThe action on the quotient space $V/V_1$ (where $V_1$ is the subspace spanned by the first basis vector) is trivial. In the dual representation $V^\\vee$, there is a one-dimensional subspace on which $I_\\ell$ acts by $\\bar{\\chi}_p^{-1}$ and a one-dimensional subspace of invariants. This implies that in $V$, there is a one-dimensional submodule and a one-dimensional quotient on which $I_\\ell$ acts non-trivially.\nLet's analyze the fixed space directly. Let the basis be $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$. The action is $\\sigma(e_2)=e_2$ (up to a choice of basis giving the lower-triangular form, but let's stick to the upper-triangular form from Tate uniformization) and $\\sigma(e_1) = \\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma) e_1 + c(\\sigma) e_2$. Let $v=ae_1+be_2$ be an element in $V^{I_\\ell}$.\n$\\sigma(v) = a(\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma)e_1 + c(\\sigma)e_2) + b e_2 = a\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma)e_1 + (ac(\\sigma)+b)e_2$.\nFor $\\sigma(v)=v$, we must have $a\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma)e_1 + (ac(\\sigma)+b)e_2 = ae_1+be_2$. Equating coefficients:\n$a\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma) = a$ and $ac(\\sigma)+b = b$.\nThe second equation simplifies to $ac(\\sigma)=0$. The first equation, $a(\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma)-1)=0$, must hold for all $\\sigma \\in I_\\ell$. Since $\\bar{\\chi}_p$ is non-trivial, there exists a $\\sigma$ such that $\\bar{\\chi}_p(\\sigma) \\neq 1$. This forces $a=0$.\nIf $a=0$, the condition $ac(\\sigma)=0$ is satisfied trivially.\nThe vectors fixed by all of $I_\\ell$ are thus of the form $be_2$ for any $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$. This is a one-dimensional subspace of $V$.\nSo, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V^{I_\\ell}) = 1$.\nThe Artin conductor exponent is then:\n$$f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = 2 - \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(V^{I_\\ell}) = 2 - 1 = 1$$\nThus, if $f_{\\ell}(E)=1$ (multiplicative reduction and $\\ell \\neq p$), then $f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p})=1$.\n\nSummary of results for $\\ell \\neq p$:\n- If $E$ has good reduction at $\\ell$, $f_{\\ell}(E)=0$ and $f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p})=0$.\n- If $E$ has multiplicative reduction at $\\ell$, $f_{\\ell}(E)=1$ and $f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p})=1$.\nIn all cases for $\\ell \\neq p$, we have $f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = f_{\\ell}(E)$.\n\nNow we can compute the Serre conductor $N(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p})$.\nThe conductor of the elliptic curve $E$ is given by $N(E)=\\prod_{\\ell} \\ell^{f_{\\ell}(E)}$. We can separate the factor at $p$:\n$$N(E) = p^{f_p(E)} \\prod_{\\ell \\neq p} \\ell^{f_{\\ell}(E)}$$\nThe Serre conductor is defined as:\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = \\prod_{\\ell \\neq p} \\ell^{f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p})}$$\nSubstituting our finding that $f_{\\ell}(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = f_{\\ell}(E)$ for all $\\ell \\neq p$:\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = \\prod_{\\ell \\neq p} \\ell^{f_{\\ell}(E)}$$\nBy comparing this with the expression for $N(E)$, we can express the Serre conductor in terms of $N(E)$ and the local factor at $p$:\n$$\\prod_{\\ell \\neq p} \\ell^{f_{\\ell}(E)} = \\frac{N(E)}{p^{f_p(E)}}$$\nTherefore, the Serre conductor is the prime-to-$p$ part of the conductor of $E$. The value $f_p(E)$ is given to be in $\\{0,1\\}$, corresponding to good or multiplicative reduction at $p$, respectively.\n\nThe final expression for the Serre conductor is:\n$$N(\\bar{\\rho}_{E,p}) = \\frac{N(E)}{p^{f_{p}(E)}}$$\nThis result is a specific case of what was once known as Serre's conjecture on modularity of Galois representations (now a theorem by Khare and Wintenberger), which predicts the conductor of a mod $p$ Galois representation.

The prime in question is $l=13$. Since $p \\neq l$, the image of the wild inertia subgroup $P_l$ (the unique pro-$l$ Sylow subgroup of $I_l$) under the representation must be trivial. This is because the order of any element in the image must divide the order of $\\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{5})$, which is $(5^2-1)(5^2-5) = 24 \\times 20 = 480$. The order of elements in the image of $P_l$ must be a power of $l=13$, and the only power of $13$ dividing $480$ is $13^0=1$. Thus, the action of $P_l$ is trivial. This means the representation is tamely ramified.\n\nFor a tamely ramified representation, the higher ramification groups $G_i$ for $i \\ge 1$ act trivially on $V$. Consequently, $V^{G_i} = V$ for all $i \\ge 1$, which implies $\\dim(V/V^{G_i}) = 0$ for $i \\ge 1$. The sum for the conductor exponent therefore truncates to its first term, $i=0$:\n$$ f_{l}(\\rho_l) = \\frac{\\dim(V / V^{G_0})}{|G_0:G_0|} = \\dim(V/V^{G_0}) = \\dim(V/V^{I_l}) $$\nThe conductor exponent is simply the dimension of the space of non-invariants under the inertia group action. This is equal to $\\dim(V) - \\dim(V^{I_l})$.\n\nThe space $V$ is a $2$-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_5$. The problem states that the inertia subgroup $I_l$ acts via the matrix $U = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The subspace of inertia invariants, $V^{I_l}$, consists of all vectors $v \\in V$ such that $Uv=v$. Let $v = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{F}_5^2$. The condition is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} x+y \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis equality of vectors requires $x+y=x$, which implies $y=0$. Thus, the subspace of invariants $V^{I_l}$ is the set of all vectors of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_5$. This is a $1$-dimensional subspace of $V$, spanned by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSo, we have $\\dim(V) = 2$ and $\\dim(V^{I_l}) = 1$. The Artin conductor exponent is:\n$$ f_{l} = \\dim(V) - \\dim(V^{I_l}) = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\n\nPart 2: Obstruction to Level-Lowering at $l=13$\n\nRibet's level-lowering theorem (incorporating what was formerly the 'epsilon conjecture') provides precise conditions under which a modular Galois representation $\\rho$ can be realized by a modular form of a lower level. Specifically, for a prime $l \\ne p$ where the initial form has level $N$ with $l | N$, the theorem gives a criterion on the local representation $\\rho_l = \\rho|_{G_{\\mathbb{Q}_l}}$ that determines whether $\\rho$ can also arise from a form whose level is not divisible by $l$.\n\nThe crucial condition for a weight $2$ modular representation $\\rho$ is that the level can be lowered to be prime to $l$ if and only if the local representation $\\rho_l$ is **flat** (or `finie`) at $l$. A representation that is not flat presents an obstruction to lowering the level at $l$. The representation described in the problem is specifically constructed to be not flat.\n\nWe analyze the structure of the given $\\rho_l$. It acts on $V=\\mathbb{F}_5^2$. The subspace $V_1 = \\mathrm{span}\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\}$ is stable under the action of the entire local group $G_{\\mathbb{Q}_l}$, since it is stable under both the inertia generator $U$ and the Frobenius element $F$:\n$$ U\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad F\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 3\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, $\\rho_l$ is a reducible representation, fitting into a short exact sequence of representations:\n$$ 0 \\to \\chi_1 \\to \\rho_l \\to \\chi_2 \\to 0 $$\nHere, $\\chi_1$ is the character governing the action on the subrepresentation $V_1$, and $\\chi_2$ is the character on the quotient $V/V_1$.\n- From the action of $U$ and $F$ on $V_1$, we see that $\\chi_1$ is unramified (trivial on inertia) and $\\chi_1(\\mathrm{Frob}_l) = 3$.\n- The action on the quotient $V/V_1$ is given by the lower-right entry of the matrices. For any $g \\in I_l$, its action matrix is a power of $U$, so the entry is $1$. For Frob$_l$, the entry is $1$. Thus, $\\chi_2$ is the trivial character, i.e., it is unramified and $\\chi_2(\\mathrm{Frob}_l)=1$.\n\nA key property of flat representations is that non-split extensions of flat representations are themselves flat only if the extension class lies in a specific (\"finite\") part of a Galois cohomology group, denoted $H^1_f$. For an extension of unramified characters like ours, the representation $\\rho_l$ is flat if and only if its extension class is unramified. An extension class is unramified if the corresponding $1$-cocycle is trivial on the inertia group $I_l$.\n\nIn our case, the extension is given by a cocycle $c: G_{\\mathbb{Q}_l} \\to \\mathrm{Hom}(\\chi_2, \\chi_1) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_5(\\chi_1)$. The action of an element $g \\in G_{\\mathbb{Q}_l}$ is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} \\chi_1(g) & c(g) \\\\ 0 & \\chi_2(g) \\end{pmatrix}$. The action of a generator of tame inertia $\\tau \\in I_l$ is given as $U = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ are unramified, $\\chi_1(\\tau)=1$ and $\\chi_2(\\tau)=1$.\nComparing the matrix forms, we have $c(\\tau) = 1$. Since the cocycle is non-zero on an element of the inertia group, the extension class is ramified.\n\nTherefore, the representation $\\rho_l$ is not flat. According to Ribet's theorem, this is precisely the obstruction to level-lowering at $l$. The representation $\\rho$ cannot be realized by a modular form of level prime to $l$.\n\nThe term \"special (Steinberg) type\" refers to this exact situation. It describes a representation whose structure is intrinsically tied to the prime $l$ dividing the conductor exactly once. For a reducible representation, this means it is a non-split, ramified extension $0 \\to \\chi \\epsilon_p \\to \\rho_l \\to \\chi \\to 0$ for some unramified character $\\chi$ (here, $\\chi=1$ and $\\epsilon_p$ is the mod $p$ cyclotomic character, which satisfies $\\epsilon_p(\\mathrm{Frob}_l) = l \\pmod p = 13 \\pmod 5 = 3$). The representation-theoretic obstruction, in its most precise form, is that **the representation $\\rho_l$ corresponds to a ramified class in the Galois cohomology group $H^1(G_{\\mathbb{Q}_l}, \\epsilon_5)$, which makes it non-flat**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3028152"}]}
