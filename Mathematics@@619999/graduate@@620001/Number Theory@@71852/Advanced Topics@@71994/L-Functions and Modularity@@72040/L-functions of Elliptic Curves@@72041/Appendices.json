A given integral model is minimal at a prime $p$ if the $p$-adic valuation of its discriminant, $v_{p}(\\Delta)$, cannot be reduced by an admissible change of variables. A sufficient condition for minimality at $p$ is $v_{p}(\\Delta) < 12$ or $v_{p}(c_{4}) < 4$. Let's compute $c_{4}$:\n$$\nc_{4} = b_{2}^{2} - 24b_{4} = 1^{2} - 24(-1) = 1+24=25 = 5^{2}\n$$\nThe primes dividing $\\Delta$ are $p=3$ and $p=23$. We check for minimality at these primes.\nFor $p=3$: $v_{3}(\\Delta) = v_{3}(-3^{2} \\times 23) = 2$. Since $2 < 12$, the model is minimal at $p=3$.\nFor $p=23$: $v_{23}(\\Delta) = v_{23}(-3^{2} \\times 23) = 1$. Since $1 < 12$, the model is minimal at $p=23$.\nThe given model is minimal at all primes. Therefore, the minimal discriminant is $\\Delta_{\\text{min}} = \\Delta = -207$. The primes of bad reduction are $p=3$ and $p=23$. For all other primes $p$, the curve has good reduction, and thus $f_{p}=0$. We now use Tate's algorithm to determine the local conductor exponents $f_{3}$ and $f_{23}$.\n\n**Analysis at $p=3$:**\nThe type of reduction at a prime $p$ can be determined from the $p$-adic valuation of the $j$-invariant, $j(E) = c_{4}^{3}/\\Delta$. If $v_{p}(j) < 0$, the reduction is multiplicative. If $v_{p}(j) \\geq 0$, the reduction is additive.\nFor $p=3$:\n$$\nv_{3}(j) = v_{3}\\left(\\frac{c_{4}^{3}}{\\Delta}\\right) = v_{3}(25^{3}) - v_{3}(-207) = v_{3}((5^{2})^{3}) - v_{3}(-3^{2} \\times 23) = 0 - 2 = -2\n$$\nSince $v_{3}(j) = -2 < 0$, the reduction is multiplicative. According to Kodaira's classification, this corresponds to type $I_{n}$ for some $n \\geq 1$. By Tate's algorithm, for multiplicative reduction, the integer $n$ is given by $n=v_{p}(\\Delta_{\\text{min}})$.\nHere, $n = v_{3}(\\Delta_{\\text{min}}) = v_{3}(-207) = 2$.\nThus, the Kodaira symbol at $p=3$ is $I_{2}$.\nFor any multiplicative reduction (type $I_{n}$ with $n \\geq 1$), the local conductor exponent is $f_{p}=1$.\nTherefore, $f_{3} = 1$.\n\nAs required, we can confirm this with the initial steps of Tate's algorithm. The reduced curve modulo $3$ is $\\tilde{E}: y^2+xy+y \\equiv x^3-x-1 \\pmod 3$. A singular point $(x_0, y_0)$ satisfies $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} \\equiv y-3x^2+1 \\equiv y+1 \\equiv 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\equiv 2y+x+1 \\equiv -y+x+1 \\equiv 0$.

Shifting the singular point to $(0,0)$ and examining the corresponding tangent equation confirms a node with tangents defined over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ (split multiplicative reduction), which corresponds to type $I_{n}$.\n\n**Analysis at $p=23$:**\nWe apply the same analysis for $p=23$.\n$$\nv_{23}(j) = v_{23}\\left(\\frac{c_{4}^{3}}{\\Delta}\\right) = v_{23}(25^{3}) - v_{23}(-207) = v_{23}(5^{6}) - v_{23}(-3^{2} \\times 23) = 0 - 1 = -1\n$$\nSince $v_{23}(j) = -1 < 0$, the reduction at $p=23$ is also multiplicative (type $I_{n}$).\nThe integer $n$ is $n = v_{23}(\\Delta_{\\text{min}}) = v_{23}(-207) = 1$.\nThus, the Kodaira symbol at $p=23$ is $I_{1}$.\nFor multiplicative reduction, the local conductor exponent is $f_{p}=1$.\nTherefore, $f_{23}=1$.\n\n(Note: Applying Tate's algorithm at $p=23$ shows that the reduced curve has a singular point whose coordinates lie in the quadratic extension $\\mathbb{F}_{23^2}$ but not in $\\mathbb{F}_{23}$.

However, the distinction between split and non-split multiplicative reduction does not alter the conductor exponent, which remains $f_{p}=1$.)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe local conductor exponents are $f_{3}=1$, $f_{23}=1$, and $f_{p}=0$ for all other primes $p$.\nThe global conductor $N$ is the product of the local conductors:\n$$\nN = \\prod_{p} p^{f_{p}} = 3^{f_{3}} \\times 23^{f_{23}} \\times \\prod_{p \\neq 3, 23} p^{f_{p}} = 3^{1} \\times 23^{1} \\times \\prod_{p \\neq 3, 23} p^{0}\n$$\n$$\nN = 3 \\times 23 = 69\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{69}$$", "id": "3016592"}, {"introduction": "The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture provides a breathtaking link between the analytic properties of the $L$-function and the arithmetic structure of an elliptic curve.

An elliptic curve given by the general Weierstrass equation $y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6$ has bad reduction at primes dividing its discriminant $\\Delta$. For the curve $E$, the coefficients are $a_1=0$, $a_2=0$, $a_3=1$, $a_4=-1$, and $a_6=0$. The standard invariants are computed as:\n$b_2 = a_1^{2} + 4a_2 = 0$\n$b_4 = 2a_4 + a_1a_3 = 2(-1) + 0 = -2$\n$b_6 = a_3^{2} + 4a_6 = 1^{2} + 0 = 1$\n$b_8 = a_1^2 a_6 + 4a_2 a_6 - a_1 a_3 a_4 + a_2 a_3^2 - a_4^2 = 0 + 0 - 0 + 0 - (-1)^2 = -1$\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ is then:\n$$\n\\Delta = -b_2^2 b_8 - 8b_4^3 - 27b_6^2 + 9b_2 b_4 b_6 = -0 - 8(-2)^3 - 27(1)^2 + 0 = -8(-8) - 27 = 64 - 27 = 37\n$$\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = 37$. Since $37$ is a prime number, the only prime of bad reduction is $p=37$. All other primes $p \\neq 37$ are primes of good reduction.\n\nWe now compute the number of points on the reduced curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for small primes of good reduction.\n\n**Case 1: Reduction modulo $p=2$.**\nThe equation for $E(\\mathbb{F}_2)$ is $y^2 + y = x^3 + x \\pmod 2$.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$, the expression $z^2+z$ is always $0$, since $0^2+0=0$ and $1^2+1=1+1=0$.\nSimilarly, $z^3+z$ is always $0$, since $0^3+0=0$ and $1^3+1=1+1=0$.\nThus, the equation becomes $0=0$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe possible values for $x$ are $0$ and $1$. The possible values for $y$ are $0$ and $1$.\nThis gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ affine points: $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$.\nIncluding the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$, the total number of points is $|E(\\mathbb{F}_2)| = 4 + 1 = 5$.\nFrom the reduction homomorphism, we conclude that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $5$. This means $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ can only be $1$ or $5$.\n\n**Case 2: Reduction modulo $p=3$.**\nThe equation for $E(\\mathbb{F}_3)$ is $y^2 + y = x^3 - x \\pmod 3$.\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^3 \\equiv x \\pmod 3$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_3$.\nTherefore, the right-hand side of the equation is $x^3 - x \\equiv x - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$ for all $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe equation reduces to $y^2 + y = 0 \\pmod 3$, which can be factored as $y(y+1) = 0$.\nThe solutions for $y$ are $y=0$ and $y=-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nFor each of the $3$ possible values for $x$ ($0, 1, 2$), there are $2$ possible values for $y$ ($0, 2$).\nThis gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ affine points.\nIncluding the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$, the total number of points is $|E(\\mathbb{F}_3)| = 6 + 1 = 7$.\nFrom the reduction homomorphism, we conclude that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $7$. This means $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ can only be $1$ or $7$.\n\nCombining the results, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide both $5$ and $7$. Since the greatest common divisor of $5$ and $7$ is $1$, we have:\n$$\n|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}| \\text{ divides } \\gcd(5, 7) = 1\n$$\nThis forces $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}| = 1$. The only torsion point is the point at infinity, so $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} = \\{\\mathcal{O}\\}$.\n\n### Part 2: Torsion Factor in the BSD Conjecture\n\nThe refined Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture concerns the leading term of the Taylor expansion of the Hasse-Weil L-function $L(E,s)$ of the elliptic curve $E$ at the point $s=1$. If the rank of the Mordell-Weil group $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is $r$, the conjecture states:\n$$\n\\lim_{s \\to 1} \\frac{L(E, s)}{(s-1)^r} = \\frac{\\Omega_E \\cdot \\mathrm{Reg}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cdot |\\Sha(E/\\mathbb{Q})| \\cdot \\prod_{p} c_p}{|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|^2}\n$$\nThe terms in the formula represent various arithmetic invariants of the curve: $\\Omega_E$ is the real period, $\\mathrm{Reg}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the regulator, $|\\Sha(E/\\mathbb{Q})|$ is the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group, and $c_p$ are the Tamagawa numbers.\n\nThe question asks for the \"torsion factor\" that appears in this leading term. Under the standard normalization of the quantities in the numerator, this factor is the term $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|^2$ appearing in the denominator. The problem requests the exact numerical value of this factor for the given curve.\n\nFrom Part 1, we determined that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}| = 1$.\nSubstituting this value, the torsion factor is:\n$$\n|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|^2 = 1^2 = 1\n$$\nThe numerical value of the torsion factor is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3024978"}]}
