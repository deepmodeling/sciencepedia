The eigenvalues of $\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)$ must therefore be roots of this polynomial, so they can only be $1$ or $-1$.\n\nBecause the representation $\\rho_{f,\\ell}$ is given as semisimple, any element in its image is a semisimple matrix. In particular, $\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)$ is semisimple and thus diagonalizable over the algebraically closed field $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\ell}$.

Applying this to an $\\ell$-power root of unity, we find $c(\\zeta) = \\zeta^{-1}$. From the definition of the cyclotomic character, this implies $\\chi_{\\ell}(c) = -1$.\n\nUnder the isomorphism that identifies $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_N)/\\mathbb{Q})$ with $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, the complex conjugation element $c$ corresponds to the residue class of $-1$ modulo $N$. Therefore, when evaluated at $c$, the character $\\varepsilon$ takes the value $\\varepsilon(-1)$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we obtain the determinant:\n$$\n\\det(\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)) = \\varepsilon(-1) \\cdot (-1)^{k-1}\n$$\nThe problem statement allows the use of the parity condition relating the nebentype and the weight. For a modular form $f \\in S_k(\\Gamma_0(N), \\varepsilon)$ to be non-zero, the character $\\varepsilon$ must satisfy a compatibility condition. Consider the matrix $\\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -I$. This matrix belongs to the group $\\Gamma_0(N)$ for any $N \\geq 1$. The transformation property of a modular form for this group is $(f|_k \\gamma)(z) = \\varepsilon(d_{\\gamma})f(z)$, where $d_{\\gamma}=-1$. Thus, $(f|_k [-I])(z) = \\varepsilon(-1)f(z)$.\nOn the other hand, the slash operator is defined as $(f|_k \\gamma)(z) = (cz+d)^{-k} f(\\gamma z)$. For $\\gamma=-I$, we have $c=0$, $d=-1$ and $\\gamma z = z$. So, $(f|_k [-I])(z) = (-1)^{-k}f(z)$.\nEquating these two expressions gives $\\varepsilon(-1)f(z) = (-1)^{-k}f(z)$. Since $f$ is a newform, it is not identically zero, so we can conclude:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(-1) = (-1)^{-k} = (-1)^k\n$$\nThis is the required parity condition.\n\nNow we substitute this condition back into our expression for the determinant of $\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)$:\n$$\n\\det(\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)) = (-1)^k \\cdot (-1)^{k-1} = (-1)^{2k-1} = -1\n$$\nThe determinant of $\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)$ is $-1$. This result is independent of the specific values of $k$, $N$, and $\\ell$, provided that a newform $f$ with the given parameters exists.\n\nSince $\\det(\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)) = -1$, the product of its eigenvalues is $-1$. As the eigenvalues must be $1$ or $-1$, the only possibility is that one eigenvalue is $1$ and the other is $-1$.\n\nSince $\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)$ is a diagonalizable $2 \\times 2$ matrix with eigenvalues $\\{1, -1\\}$, it is conjugate to the matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis explicitly determines the conjugacy class of $\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)$.\n\nFinally, we deduce the parity of the representation $\\rho_{f,\\ell}$. A two-dimensional Galois representation $\\rho$ is defined to be **odd** if $\\det(\\rho(c)) = -1$ and **even** if $\\det(\\rho(c)) = 1$. As we have shown that $\\det(\\rho_{f,\\ell}(c)) = -1$, it follows that the representation $\\rho_{f,\\ell}$ is odd. This oddness is a universal property for all Galois representations attached to cuspidal newforms of weight $k \\geq 2$, and it is a direct consequence of the interplay between the determinant formula and the consistency condition $\\varepsilon(-1) = (-1)^k$ required for the existence of the modular form itself.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3014857"}, {"introduction": "One of the most important properties of a Galois representation is whether it is irreducible, meaning it cannot be broken down into smaller representations.
