The steps required are clearly delineated and mathematically sound.\n\nThe affine plane curve $C$ is defined by the equation $F(x,y) = 0$, where $F(x,y) = y^{2} - x^{3} + 3x^{2}$. The ground field is the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Determination of Singular Points\n\nA point $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ on the curve $C$ is singular if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n1. $F(x_{0}, y_{0}) = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x_{0}, y_{0}) = 0$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x_{0}, y_{0}) = 0$\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $F(x,y) = y^{2} - x^{3} + 3x^{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^{2} + 6x $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y $$\n\nNext, we set these partial derivatives to zero to find the coordinates of potential singular points:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y = 0 \\implies y = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^{2} + 6x = -3x(x - 2) = 0 \\implies x = 0 \\text{ or } x = 2 $$\n\nThis gives two candidate points: $(0,0)$ and $(2,0)$. We must now verify which of these points lie on the curve $C$ by checking if they satisfy the original equation $F(x,y) = 0$.\n\nFor the point $(0,0)$:\n$$ F(0,0) = (0)^{2} - (0)^{3} + 3(0)^{2} = 0 - 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nThe point $(0,0)$ satisfies all three conditions. Therefore, $(0,0)$ is a singular point of the curve $C$.\n\nFor the point $(2,0)$:\n$$ F(2,0) = (0)^{2} - (2)^{3} + 3(2)^{2} = 0 - 8 + 3(4) = -8 + 12 = 4 $$\nSince $F(2,0) = 4 \\neq 0$, the point $(2,0)$ does not lie on the curve $C$ and is therefore not a singular point.\n\nThus, the only singular point of the curve $C$ is $(0,0)$.\n\n### Step 2: Computation of the Hessian Matrix at the Singular Point\n\nThe Hessian matrix of $F$, denoted $H_{F}$, is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives:\n$$ H_{F}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nWe compute the second-order partial derivatives from the first-order derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-3x^{2} + 6x) = -6x + 6 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2y) = 2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2y) = 0 $$\nBy Clairaut's theorem for the continuous function $F$, we have $\\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$.\n\nThe Hessian matrix is therefore:\n$$ H_{F}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -6x + 6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nWe evaluate this matrix at the singular point $(0,0)$:\n$$ H_{F}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -6(0) + 6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n### Step 3: Classification of the Singularity and Determinant Calculation\n\nThe type of a singular point can be characterized by analyzing the Taylor expansion of the function $F$ at that point. Let the singular point be $(x_{0}, y_{0})$. The Taylor expansion of $F$ around this point for increments $h = x - x_{0}$ and $k = y - y_{0}$ is:\n$$ F(x_{0}+h, y_{0}+k) = F(x_{0},y_{0}) + \\left(h \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} + k \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\right)\\bigg|_{(x_{0},y_{0})} + \\frac{1}{2!} \\left(h^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x^{2}} + 2hk \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x \\partial y} + k^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial y^{2}}\\right)\\bigg|_{(x_{0},y_{0})} + \\dots $$\n\nAt our singular point $(0,0)$, we have $F(0,0)=0$ and $\\nabla F(0,0)=(0,0)$. Thus, the constant and linear terms vanish. The expansion becomes:\n$$ F(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x^{2}}(0,0) + 2xy \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial x \\partial y}(0,0) + y^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial y^{2}}(0,0) \\right) + \\text{higher-order terms} $$\nSubstituting the values of the second partials at $(0,0)$:\n$$ F(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(6x^{2} + 2(0)xy + 2y^{2}) - x^{3} = 3x^{2} + y^{2} - x^{3} $$\nThe lowest-degree nonzero homogeneous part of the Taylor expansion of $F$ at $(0,0)$ is the quadratic term $Q(x,y) = 3x^{2} + y^{2}$. This term corresponds to the quadratic form associated with the Hessian matrix. The degree of this term is $m=2$, so the singularity is a double point.\n\nThe classification of this double point depends on whether the quadratic form $Q(x,y)$ is degenerate. The nondegeneracy of the quadratic form is equivalent to the Hessian matrix at the point being non-singular, i.e., having a non-zero determinant.\n\nWe compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix at $(0,0)$:\n$$ \\det(H_{F}(0,0)) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (6)(2) - (0)(0) = 12 $$\n\nSince $\\det(H_{F}(0,0)) = 12 \\neq 0$, the quadratic form is non-degenerate. A singular point whose lowest-degree term in the Taylor expansion is a non-degenerate quadratic form is called an ordinary double point, or a node. The tangents at the node are given by the linear factors of the quadratic form $3x^{2} + y^{2} = 0$. Over $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{R}$, this has only the solution $(0,0)$, corresponding to an isolated real point (an acnode). Over $\\mathbb{C}$, it factors into two distinct linear forms $(y - i\\sqrt{3}x)(y + i\\sqrt{3}x)=0$, confirming the singularity is a node.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the determinant of the Hessian matrix at the singular point.

The points are symmetrical with respect to the $x$-axis. The line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is the vertical line $x=x_{1}$. The intersection of this line with the curve $y^{2} = x^{3} + a x + b$ yields only the points $P$ and $Q$. In projective coordinates, this vertical line intersects the curve at a third point, the point at infinity, which we denote by $\\mathcal{O}$. By definition, the sum $P+Q$ is the reflection of this third point across the $x$-axis. Since $\\mathcal{O}$ is its own reflection, $P+Q = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\nIf $x_{1} \\neq x_{2}$, the line $L$ passing through $P$ and $Q$ is not vertical. Its equation is $y = \\lambda x + \\nu$, where the slope $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$$\nSince $P$ and $Q$ are on the line, we have $y_{1} = \\lambda x_{1} + \\nu$ and $y_{2} = \\lambda x_{2} + \\nu$. This implies $\\nu = y_{1} - \\lambda x_{1} = y_{2} - \\lambda x_{2}$.\n\nTo find the intersection points of the line $L$ and the curve $E$, we substitute the expression for $y$ into the curve's equation:\n$$(\\lambda x + \\nu)^{2} = x^{3} + a x + b$$\nExpanding the left side and rearranging gives a cubic equation in $x$:\n$$\\lambda^{2} x^{2} + 2\\lambda\\nu x + \\nu^{2} = x^{3} + a x + b$$\n$$x^{3} - \\lambda^{2} x^{2} + (a - 2\\lambda\\nu) x + (b - \\nu^{2}) = 0$$\nThe roots of this cubic polynomial correspond to the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points of $L$ and $E$. We already know two of these roots: $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, the $x$-coordinates of $P$ and $Q$.

We want to find the coordinates of $2P = P+P = (x_{3}, y_{3})$.\n\nIf $y_{1} = 0$, the point $P$ is a $2$-torsion point. The tangent line to the curve at $P$ is a vertical line $x=x_{1}$.
