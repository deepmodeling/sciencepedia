An elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ in short Weierstrass form is given by an equation $y^{2} = x^{3} + Ax + B$ with $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and nonzero discriminant. A rational point $P$ on an elliptic curve is called torsion if there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $nP$ equals the identity element $\\mathcal{O}$. Two Weierstrass equations related by a rational change of variables of the form\n$$\nx = u^{2} x' + r, \\quad y = u^{3} y' + s u^{2} x' + t\n$$\nwith $u, r, s, t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $u \\neq 0$, define isomorphic elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$; in particular, they induce a group isomorphism on rational points preserving torsion orders.\n\nStep 1: Verify torsion on $E_{\\min}$. The curve\n$$\nE_{\\min}:\\quad y^{2} = x^{3} - x\n$$\nhas the point $P_{\\min} = (1, 0)$. Substituting $x = 1$, $y = 0$ gives $0 = 1 - 1 = 0$, so $P_{\\min} \\in E_{\\min}(\\mathbb{Q})$. If $y = 0$ for a point $(x, y)$ on a short Weierstrass curve, then $(x, 0)$ is a $2$-torsion point: in the group law, the tangent at a point with $y \\neq 0$ is finite slope, whereas at $y = 0$ the tangent is vertical; geometrically, for $y = 0$, reflection across the $x$-axis fixes the point, which implies that $(x, 0) = -(x, 0)$ and hence $2(x, 0) = \\mathcal{O}$. Thus $P_{\\min}$ is a point of order $2$ and is torsion.\n\nStep 2: Transport $P_{\\min}$ to the scaled model $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ and compute denominators. Consider the rational change of variables\n$$\nx_{0} = 4x, \\qquad y_{0} = 8y,\n$$\nwhich is of the allowed form with $u = 2$ and $r = s = t = 0$. Substituting $x_{0} = 4x$ and $y_{0} = 8y$ into $E_{\\min}$ yields\n$$\n(8y)^{2} = (4x)^{3} - (4x) \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 64 y^{2} = 64 x^{3} - 4x \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad y^{2} = x^{3} - \\frac{1}{16} x.\n$$\nHence the scaled model is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{sc}}:\\quad y^{2} = x^{3} - \\frac{1}{16} x.\n$$\nNote that $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is not an integral model (its coefficient $-\\frac{1}{16}$ is not an integer) and in particular is not a minimal integral model over $\\mathbb{Z}$. The isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}$ from $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ to $E_{\\min}$ sends $(x, y) \\mapsto (x_{0}, y_{0}) = (4x, 8y)$. Therefore, the inverse map sends a point $(x_{0}, y_{0}) \\in E_{\\min}(\\mathbb{Q})$ to $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{4}, \\frac{y_{0}}{8}\\right) \\in E_{\\mathrm{sc}}(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nApplying this to $P_{\\min} = (1, 0)$ gives\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{sc}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{0}{8}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right).\n$$\nIn lowest terms, the $x$-coordinate has denominator $4$.\n\nStep 3: Explain disappearance of denominators under minimalization and the role of the Nagell–Lutz theorem. The two models $E_{\\min}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ are isomorphic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The point $P_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is torsion because torsion is preserved under isomorphism of elliptic curves. However, $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is not a minimal integral model, so there is no guarantee from the Nagell–Lutz theorem that torsion points on $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ will have integral coordinates. Indeed, we found that $x(P_{\\mathrm{sc}}) = \\frac{1}{4}$ has a nontrivial denominator. Transforming back to the minimal integral model $E_{\\min}$ via $(x, y) \\mapsto (x_{0}, y_{0}) = (4x, 8y)$ multiplies the coordinates by powers of $2$, clearing these denominators and producing the integral coordinates of $P_{\\min} = (1, 0)$. This illustrates the necessity of minimal integral models in the Nagell–Lutz framework: on a minimal integral model, torsion points have integral coordinates, while on a non-minimal (here non-integral scaled) model, torsion points may acquire denominators that vanish upon returning to a minimal model.\n\nThe least common denominator of the $x$-coordinate of $P_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ in lowest terms is therefore $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3028533"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of the curve's model, we now turn to a complete application of the Nagell-Lutz theorem to determine the full rational torsion subgroup.

We are asked to find the order of its rational torsion subgroup, $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$.\n\nFirst, we enumerate a finite set of candidate rational torsion points. A fundamental result in the theory of elliptic curves, the Nagell-Lutz theorem, provides the necessary constraints. As a \"well-tested fact,\" for an elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ with integer coefficients $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, any rational torsion point $P=(x,y)$, other than the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, must have integer coordinates, i.e., $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, either $y=0$ (in which case $P$ is a point of order $2$) or $y^2$ must divide the discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$.\n\nFor the curve $E$, we have $A=-6$ and $B=9$. The coefficients are integers. The discriminant is\n$$ \\Delta = -16(4(-6)^3 + 27(9)^2) = -16(4(-216) + 27(81)) = -16(-864 + 2187) = -16(1323) $$\n$$ \\Delta = -16(3^3 \\cdot 7^2) = -2^4 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 7^2 = -21168 $$\nThus, for any torsion point $(x,y)$, we must have $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We consider two cases for $y$.\n\nCase 1: $y=0$.\nThe point's coordinates must satisfy $x^3 - 6x + 9 = 0$. By the rational root theorem, any integer root $x$ must divide $9$. The divisors of $9$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 9$.\nTesting these values:\n$f(1) = 1 - 6 + 9 = 4 \\ne 0$\n$f(-1) = -1 + 6 + 9 = 14 \\ne 0$\n$f(3) = 27 - 18 + 9 = 18 \\ne 0$\n$f(-3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0$. Thus, $x=-3$ is a root.\n$f(9) = 729 - 54 + 9 = 684 \\ne 0$\n$f(-9) = -729 + 54 + 9 = -666 \\ne 0$\nThe only integer root is $x=-3$. Synthetic division yields $x^3 - 6x + 9 = (x+3)(x^2 - 3x + 3)$. The quadratic factor $x^2-3x+3$ has discriminant $(-3)^2 - 4(1)(3) = 9-12 = -3  0$, so it has no real roots.\nThe only rational point with $y=0$ is $P_1 = (-3,0)$. This is a point of order $2$.\n\nCase 2: $y \\ne 0$.\nThe Nagell-Lutz theorem requires that $y^2$ divides $\\Delta = -21168$. Since $y^2>0$, $y^2$ must be a positive square divisor of $21168 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 7^2$. For $y^2$ to be a perfect square, the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. Thus $y^2$ must divide $2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2$. This implies that $y$ must divide $\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 84$.\nWe test values of $y^2$ where $y$ is a divisor of $84$, looking for integer solutions to $x^3 - 6x + (9-y^2) = 0$.\n- If $y = \\pm 1$, $y^2=1$: $x^3 - 6x + 8 = 0$. Potential integer roots are divisors of $8 (\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8)$. None are roots.\n- If $y = \\pm 2$, $y^2=4$: $x^3 - 6x + 5 = 0$. $(x-1)$ is a factor: $(x-1)(x^2+x-5)=0$. $x=1$ is an integer root. This gives points $(1,2)$ and $(1,-2)$.\n- If $y = \\pm 3$, $y^2=9$: $x^3 - 6x = 0$, so $x(x^2-6)=0$. $x=0$ is an integer root. This gives points $(0,3)$ and $(0,-3)$.\n- If $y = \\pm 4$, $y^2=16$: $x^3 - 6x - 7 = 0$. No integer roots.\n- If $y = \\pm 5$, $y$ is not a divisor of $84$.\n- If $y = \\pm 6$, $y^2=36$: $x^3 - 6x - 27 = 0$. No integer roots.\n- If $y = \\pm 7$, $y^2=49$: $x^3 - 6x - 40 = 0$. $(x-4)$ is a factor: $(x-4)(x^2+4x+10)=0$. $x=4$ is an integer root. This gives points $(4,7)$ and $(4,-7)$.\nFurther checks for larger divisors of $84$ do not yield any other integer points.\nThe set of candidate torsion points is $\\{\\mathcal{O}, (-3,0), (1, \\pm 2), (0, \\pm 3), (4, \\pm 7)\\}$.\n\nSecond, we verify the order of each candidate. The group law for adding a point $P=(x,y)$ to itself (doubling) uses the slope of the tangent line $\\lambda = (3x^2+A)/(2y)$.\n- The point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ has order $1$.\n- The point $P_1 = (-3,0)$ has $y=0$, so its tangent is vertical. $2P_1 = \\mathcal{O}$. It has order $2$.\n- Let's check $P_2 = (1,2)$. The slope for doubling is $\\lambda = \\frac{3(1)^2 - 6}{2(2)} = \\frac{-3}{4}$. The x-coordinate of $2P_2$ is $x_{2P_2} = \\lambda^2 - 2x = (-\\frac{3}{4})^2 - 2(1) = \\frac{9}{16} - 2 = -\\frac{23}{16}$. Since $x_{2P_2}$ is not an integer, $2P_2$ cannot be a torsion point (by Nagell-Lutz). If $P_2$ were a torsion point, all its multiples would also have to be torsion points. Thus, $(1,2)$ is not a torsion point. Similarly, its inverse $(1,-2)$ is not a torsion point.\n- Let's check $P_3 = (0,3)$. The slope for doubling is $\\lambda = \\frac{3(0)^2 - 6}{2(3)} = -1$. The coordinates of $2P_3$ are $x_{2P_3} = (-1)^2 - 2(0) = 1$ and $y_{2P_3} = -1(0-1)-3 = -2$. So $2P_3 = (1,-2)$. Since we have already shown that $(1,-2)$ is not a torsion point, $P_3=(0,3)$ cannot be a torsion point. Neither can its inverse $(0,-3)$.\n- Let's check $P_4 = (4,7)$. The slope for doubling is $\\lambda = \\frac{3(4)^2 - 6}{2(7)} = \\frac{42}{14} = 3$. The coordinates of $2P_4$ are $x_{2P_4} = 3^2 - 2(4) = 1$ and $y_{2P_4} = 3(4-1)-7=2$. So $2P_4 = (1,2)$. Since $(1,2)$ is not a torsion point, $P_4=(4,7)$ cannot be a torsion point. Neither can its inverse $(4,-7)$.\nBased on this analysis, the only torsion points are $\\mathcal{O}$ and $(-3,0)$. This suggests the torsion subgroup is $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} = \\{\\mathcal{O}, (-3,0)\\}$, which has order $2$.\n\nThird, we justify that no torsion points have been omitted. For a prime $p$ of good reduction (i.e., $p$ does not divide $\\Delta=-21168$), the reduction-modulo-$p$ map from $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ to the group of points over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, denoted $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, is an injective homomorphism. This implies $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$. The primes of bad reduction are $2, 3, 7$.\n- Let $p=5$ (a prime of good reduction). The reduced curve is $E_5: y^2 \\equiv x^3 - x + 4 \\pmod{5}$. By checking all $x \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, we find the points: $(0, \\pm 2), (1, \\pm 2), (2,0), (4, \\pm 2)$, plus the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$. This gives $|E_5(\\mathbb{F}_5)| = 7+1 = 8$. So $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $8$.\n- Let $p=11$ (a prime of good reduction). The reduced curve is $E_{11}: y^2 \\equiv x^3 - 6x + 9 \\pmod{11}$. Enumerating points gives $|E_{11}(\\mathbb{F}_{11})| = 15+1=16$. Thus $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ divides $16$.\nSo, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $\\gcd(8,16)=8$.\nWe know there is a point of order $2$, namely $(-3,0)$, so the order must be an even divisor of $8$. The possible orders are $2, 4, 8$.\nTo exclude orders $4$ and $8$, we must show there is no point of order $4$. A point $P$ has order $4$ if and only if $2P$ is a point of order $2$. The only point of order $2$ is $T=(-3,0)$. We search for a rational point $P=(x,y)$ such that $2P=T$. The doubling formula requires $y \\ne 0$.\nThe coordinates of $2P$ are $x_{2P} = \\lambda^2 - 2x = -3$ and $y_{2P} = \\lambda(x-x_{2P})-y = 0$, where $\\lambda=\\frac{3x^2-6}{2y}$.\nThe condition $y_{2P}=0$ implies $\\lambda(x-(-3)) = y$, so $\\frac{3x^2-6}{2y}(x+3) = y$.\nThis gives $(3x^2-6)(x+3) = 2y^2$. Substituting $y^2 = x^3-6x+9$:\n$3x^3 + 9x^2 - 6x - 18 = 2(x^3 - 6x + 9) = 2x^3 - 12x + 18$.\n$x^3 + 9x^2 + 6x - 36 = 0$.\nWe seek rational roots of this polynomial. Integer roots must divide $36$. Testing $x=-3$: $(-3)^3 + 9(-3)^2 + 6(-3) - 36 = -27 + 81 - 18 - 36 = 0$. So $x=-3$ is a root. Factoring gives $(x+3)(x^2+6x-12)=0$.\nThe root $x=-3$ corresponds to the point $(-3,0)$, for which $y=0$, but the doubling formula is not applicable.\nThe other roots are given by $x^2+6x-12=0$, which are $x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-4(-12)}}{2} = -3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}$. These are not rational.\nThus, there is no rational point $P$ on $E$ for which $2P=(-3,0)$. This demonstrates that there are no points of order $4$. Consequently, there can be no points of order $8$.\nThe only remaining possibility for the order of the torsion subgroup is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3028529"}, {"introduction": "The tools for studying torsion points are not only for finding the entire subgroup but also for efficiently characterizing individual points.

Any element other than the identity $\\mathcal{O}$ must be a generator and have order $7$. Our point $\\widetilde{P}=(3,5)$ is not the point at infinity. Therefore, its order is $o_{7}=7$.\n\n**Step 4: Orders of Torsion Points under Reduction.**\nLet $P \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$ be a torsion point of order $N$. The reduction map $\\rho_{p}: E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\rightarrow E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})$ for a prime $p$ of good reduction is a group homomorphism. This means $\\rho_{p}(Q_{1}+Q_{2}) = \\rho_{p}(Q_{1})+\\rho_{p}(Q_{2})$.\nIf $P$ has order $N$, then $NP = \\mathcal{O}$. Applying the homomorphism:\n$$ \\rho_{p}(NP) = \\rho_{p}(\\mathcal{O}) \\implies N \\cdot \\rho_{p}(P) = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} \\implies N\\widetilde{P} = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} $$\nThis shows that the order of $\\widetilde{P}$, $o_{p}$, must divide $N$.\nFurthermore, for any prime $p$ of good reduction, the reduction map restricted to the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ is injective. This is a standard result, often stated for primes $p$ not dividing $2\\Delta$, which holds for $p=5$ and $p=7$.\nLet $o_{p}$ be the order of $\\widetilde{P}$. Then $o_{p}\\widetilde{P} = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}$. By the homomorphism property, this is $\\rho_{p}(o_{p}P) = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} = \\rho_{p}(\\mathcal{O})$.\nSince the map is injective on torsion points, this implies $o_{p}P = \\mathcal{O}$.\nAs $N$ is the order of $P$ (the smallest positive integer such that $NP=\\mathcal{O}$), it must be that $N$ divides $o_{p}$.\nSince we have both $o_{p} \\mid N$ and $N \\mid o_{p}$, and both are positive integers, it must be that $o_{p} = N$. Thus, for a prime of good reduction where the reduction map is injective on torsion, the order of a torsion point is preserved.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation and conclusion about $P$.**\nWe are asked to compute $G=\\gcd(o_{5},o_{7})$. From our previous computations, $o_{5}=2$ and $o_{7}=7$.\n$$ G = \\gcd(2, 7) = 1 $$\nIf the point $P=(3,5)$ were a torsion point in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ of order $N$, then according to the reasoning in Step 4, its order $N$ would be preserved under reduction for $p=5$ and $p=7$. This would imply $N=o_{5}=2$ and $N=o_{7}=7$. This is a contradiction, as $2 \\neq 7$.\nTherefore, the initial assumption that $P$ is a torsion point must be false. We conclude that $P=(3,5)$ is a point of infinite order.\n\n**Step 6: Comparison with the Nagell-Lutz theorem.**\nThe Nagell-Lutz theorem provides necessary conditions for a rational point on an elliptic curve with integer coefficients to be a torsion point. For $E: y^{2}=x^{3}+Ax+B$ with $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n1. A torsion point $P=(x,y) \\neq \\mathcal{O}$ must have integer coordinates, $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. The $y$-coordinate must satisfy either $y=0$ (for points of order $2$) or $y^{2}$ divides the discriminant $\\Delta$.\n\nOur point is $P=(3,5)$. The coordinates $x=3$ and $y=5$ are integers, so condition 1 is met.\nThe $y$-coordinate is $y=5 \\neq 0$. We must check if $y^{2}$ divides $\\Delta$.\nWe have $y^{2}=5^{2}=25$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = -1728$.\nThe prime factorization of $y^{2}$ is $5^{2}$. The prime factorization of $\\Delta$ is $-2^{6} \\cdot 3^{3}$. Since the prime $5$ does not appear in the factorization of $\\Delta$, $25$ cannot divide $-1728$.\nThe second condition of the Nagell-Lutz theorem is violated. Therefore, $P=(3,5)$ cannot be a torsion point. This conclusion is consistent with the one reached using reduction modulo primes.\n\nThe specific value requested for the final answer is $G$.\n$G = \\gcd(o_{5}, o_{7}) = \\gcd(2, 7) = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3028539"}]}
