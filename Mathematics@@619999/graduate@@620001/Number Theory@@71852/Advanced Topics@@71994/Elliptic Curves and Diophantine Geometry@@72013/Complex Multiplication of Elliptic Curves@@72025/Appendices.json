All provided definitions and statements are standard and correct within the context of algebraic number theory and the theory of complex multiplication. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, to compute the class number $h(D) = |\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{D})|$ for the fundamental discriminants $D = -3, -4, -7, -8$ by finding all reduced primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms; second, to explain the connection between this number and the number of distinct $j$-invariants of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM) by the order $\\mathcal{O}_{D}$.\n\nA binary quadratic form $f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ has discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$. For $D < 0$, the form is positive definite if $a > 0$. Such a form is called primitive if $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$. The set of equivalence classes of such forms under the action of $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ forms a finite abelian group, a concrete realization of the ideal class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_D)$. Every class contains exactly one reduced form, which satisfies the conditions:\n$1.$ $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$\n$2.$ If $|b| = a$ or $a = c$, then $b \\geq 0$.\n\nFrom the discriminant equation $D = b^2 - 4ac$ and the reduction conditions, we can derive bounds on the coefficients. Since $a \\leq c$, we have $4a^2 \\leq 4ac = b^2 - D$. As $|b| \\leq a$, we have $b^2 \\leq a^2$. Combining these gives $4a^2 \\leq a^2 - D$, which simplifies to $3a^2 \\leq -D = |D|$. This yields an upper bound for the coefficient $a$:\n$$a \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{|D|}{3}}$$\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, this inequality makes the search for reduced forms finite. Furthermore, for a fundamental discriminant $D$, the coefficient $b$ must have the same parity as $D$, i.e., $b \\equiv D \\pmod{2}$.\n\nWe now enumerate the reduced forms for each given discriminant.\n\n**Case 1: $D = -3$**\nThis is a fundamental discriminant. We search for integer triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying the conditions.\n- The bound on $a$ is $a \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{|-3|}{3}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. Since $a>0$, we must have $a=1$.\n- The condition $|b| \\leq a$ implies $|b| \\leq 1$.\n- The discriminant $D=-3$ is odd, so $b$ must be odd.

We must have $a=1$.\n- The condition $|b| \\leq a$ implies $|b| \\leq 1$.\n- The discriminant $D=-7$ is odd, so $b$ must be odd.

The form is $(1, 0, 2)$.\n  - We check the reduction conditions: $|0| \\leq 1 \\leq 2$ is true. The boundary cases $|b|=a$ and $a=c$ do not apply.\n  - The form is primitive as $\\gcd(1,0,2)=1$.\n  - Thus, $x^2 + 2y^2$ is a reduced primitive form.\nWe have found exactly one reduced form. Therefore, the class number is $h(-8) = 1$.\n\nIn all four cases, the class number is $1$.\n\n**Connection to Complex Multiplication and $j$-invariants**\n\nThe theory of complex multiplication provides a profound link between the class groups of imaginary quadratic orders and the arithmetic of elliptic curves.\n\n$1$. An elliptic curve $E$ over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ is isomorphic to a complex torus $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$ for some lattice $\\Lambda$. Any such lattice is homothetic to one of the form $\\Lambda_{\\tau} = \\mathbb{Z} + \\mathbb{Z}\\tau$ for a unique $\\tau$ in the fundamental domain of $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ acting on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$. The isomorphism class of $E$ is uniquely determined by its $j$-invariant, $j(E) = j(\\tau)$.\n\n$2$. An elliptic curve $E$ is said to have Complex Multiplication (CM) by an order $\\mathcal{O}$ in an imaginary quadratic field if its endomorphism ring $\\mathrm{End}(E)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{O}$. For a generic curve, $\\mathrm{End}(E) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n$3$. A key result of CM theory is that an elliptic curve $E \\cong \\mathbb{C}/(\\mathbb{Z} + \\mathbb{Z}\\tau)$ has CM by an order $\\mathcal{O}_D$ if and only if $\\tau$ is an element of the imaginary quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$.\n\n$4$. The set of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves with CM by a specific order $\\mathcal{O}_D$ is not arbitrary. There is a canonical bijection between the ideal class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_D)$ and the set of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves with CM by $\\mathcal{O}_D$. An ideal class $[\\mathfrak{a}] \\in \\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_D)$ corresponds to the isomorphism class of the elliptic curve $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathfrak{a}$. Two such curves $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathfrak{b}$ are isomorphic if and only if the ideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$ are in the same ideal class.\n\n$5$. Combining these facts, the number of distinct isomorphism classes of elliptic curves with CM by $\\mathcal{O}_D$ is equal to the order of the class group, $h(D) = |\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_D)|$. Since isomorphism classes over $\\mathbb{C}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with their $j$-invariants, it follows that the number of distinct $j$-invariants of elliptic curves with CM by $\\mathcal{O}_D$ is precisely $h(D)$.\n\nIn our examples, we found $h(-3) = 1$, $h(-4) = 1$, $h(-7) = 1$, and $h(-8) = 1$. This implies that for each of the corresponding orders $\\mathcal{O}_{-3}$, $\\mathcal{O}_{-4}$, $\\mathcal{O}_{-7}$, and $\\mathcal{O}_{-8}$, there is exactly one isomorphism class of elliptic curves with CM by that order, and thus a single, unique $j$-invariant. For instance:\n- For $D=-3$, the order is $\\mathcal{O}_{-3}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}]$. The corresponding $j$-invariant is $j(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}) = 0$.\n- For $D=-4$, the order is $\\mathcal{O}_{-4}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-1}]$. The corresponding $j$-invariant is $j(i) = 1728$.\nThe number of distinct $j$-invariants arising from CM by $\\mathcal{O}_D$ is $h(D)$, which we computed by counting reduced quadratic forms. This provides a direct bridge between these two enumerations.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector of the computed class numbers.\n$h(-3)=1$\n$h(-4)=1$\n$h(-7)=1$\n$h(-8)=1$\nSo the vector is $(1, 1, 1, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3010294"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise focused on counting CM elliptic curves, this practice turns to identifying them via their most important invariant: the $j$-invariant.

This group is generated by the absolute Frobenius automorphism $\\pi_{5}: (x, y) \\mapsto (x^{5}, y^{5})$. A subgroup is rational if all its points are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$. The point $(0,0)$ has coordinates in the prime field $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$, so it is an $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$-rational point. The point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ is also rational over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$. Thus, the subgroup $G = \\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0)\\}$ is a rational subgroup, as it is a subset of $E(\\mathbb{F}_{5})$.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the Isogeny and Codomain Curve\n\nWe use VÃ©lu's formulas to compute the degree-$2$ isogeny $\\varphi: E \\to E' = E/G$ with kernel $G = \\{\\mathcal{O}, Q_{0}\\}$, where $Q_{0}=(x_{0},y_{0}) = (0,0)$. The initial curve is $E: y^{2}=x^{3}+Ax+B$ with $A=1$ and $B=0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$.\n\nFor a kernel generated by a point of order $2$, $Q_{0}=(x_{0},0)$, the isogeny map $\\varphi: (x,y) \\mapsto (X,Y)$ is given by:\n$$X = x + \\frac{3x_{0}^{2}+A}{x-x_{0}}$$\n$$Y = y\\left(1 - \\frac{3x_{0}^{2}+A}{(x-x_{0})^{2}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $x_{0}=0$ and $A=1$ (all calculations are in $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$):\n$$X = x + \\frac{3(0)^{2}+1}{x-0} = x + \\frac{1}{x}$$\n$$Y = y\\left(1 - \\frac{3(0)^{2}+1}{(x-0)^{2}}\\right) = y\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right)$$\nThe explicit rational map for $\\varphi$ is $\\varphi(x,y) = \\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}, y\\left(1-\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nTo find the equation of the codomain curve $E'$, we express $Y^{2}$ in terms of $X$.\n$$Y^{2} = y^{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right)^{2} = (x^{3}+x)\\left(\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x^{2}}\\right)^{2} = x(x^{2}+1)\\frac{(x^{2}-1)^{2}}{x^{4}} = \\frac{(x^{2}+1)(x^{2}-1)^{2}}{x^{3}}$$\nWe relate this to $X = x + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{x^{2}+1}{x}$.\nA known formula for the codomain of an isogeny with kernel generated by $(x_0, 0)$ from $y^2 = x^3+Ax+B$ is $Y^2 = X^3 + A'X + B'$ where $A' = A-5(3x_0^2+A)$ and $B' = B-7(x_0(3x_0^2+A))$. Working over $\\mathbb{F}_5$, the terms with factor $5$ and $7 \\equiv 2$ become $0$ and $2$.\nLet's use the explicit coefficients from VÃ©lu's formulas. Let $t_0=3x_0^2+A=1$ and $u_0=2(x_0^3+Ax_0+B)=0$. Let $t=\\sum t_Q = t_0 = 1$ and $w = \\sum (u_Q+x_Q t_Q)=u_0+x_0 t_0=0$.\nThe coefficients of $E'$ are $A' = A - 5t$ and $B' = B - 7w$. In $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$:\n$$A' = A - 5t = 1 - 0 \\cdot 1 = 1$$\n$$B' = B - 7w = 0 - 2 \\cdot 0 = 0$$\nThus, the codomain curve is $E': y^{2} = x^{3}+x$. This is isomorphic to the original curve $E$.\n\n### Part 3: Classification of the Isogeny Edge\n\nThe classification of an $\\ell$-isogeny edge in a CM isogeny volcano (ascending, horizontal, or descending) depends on the endomorphism rings of the domain and codomain curves.\n\nFirst, we establish the endomorphism ring of $E/\\mathbb{F}_{5}$. The curve $E_{0}/\\mathbb{Q}$ has CM by the maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. The discriminant of $K$ is $\\Delta_{K}=-4$. The reduction prime is $p=5$. To determine if the reduction is ordinary or supersingular, we check if $p$ splits, is inert, or ramifies in $K$. This is determined by the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{\\Delta_{K}}{p})$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{-4}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{5-1}{2}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2^2}{5}\\right) = (-1)^{2} \\cdot 1 = 1$$\nSince the symbol is $1$, the prime $p=5$ splits in $K$. By the theory of complex multiplication, this implies that the reduction $E/\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ is ordinary and its endomorphism ring is the maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Thus, $\\operatorname{End}(E) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Curves with endomorphism ring being the maximal order lie on the \"crater\" of the isogeny volcano (level $0$).\n\nNext, we analyze the isogeny prime $\\ell=2$. In the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the prime $2$ ramifies, since $2 = -i(1+i)^{2}$, where $1+i$ is a prime element of norm $2$. The ideal factorization is $(2) = (1+i)^{2}$. The theory of isogeny volcanoes states that for a ramified prime $\\ell$, there is one horizontal $\\ell$-isogeny and $\\ell$ descending $\\ell$-isogenies (to an isomorphic codomain) from any curve on the crater.\n\nAn isogeny is horizontal if its kernel is an $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$-submodule. It is descending if its kernel is not an $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$-submodule. We must test if our kernel $G=\\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0)\\}$ is an $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$-submodule.\nThe ring $\\mathcal{O}_{K}=\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is generated by $i$ as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-algebra. So we only need to check if $G$ is stable under the action of the endomorphism $[i]$.\nThe CM endomorphism $[i]$ on $E_{0}: y^{2}=x^{3}+x$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ is given by $[i](x,y)=(-x,iy)$. Over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$, we need a value $\\gamma$ such that $\\gamma^{2}=-1 \\pmod 5$. We can choose $\\gamma=2$, since $2^{2}=4 \\equiv -1$. So, the action of $[i]$ on $E/\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ is $[i](x,y) = (-x, 2y)$.\nLet's apply this to the non-identity element $(0,0) \\in G$:\n$$[i](0,0) = (-0, 2 \\cdot 0) = (0,0)$$\nSince $[i](0,0) \\in G$, and trivially $[1](0,0)=(0,0) \\in G$, $G$ is closed under the action of any element of $\\operatorname{End}(E) = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Thus, $G$ is an $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$-submodule.\n\nBecause its kernel is an $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$-submodule, the isogeny $\\varphi:E \\to E/G$ is a **horizontal** isogeny. This theoretical conclusion is consistent with our computational result in Part 2, where we found that the codomain curve $E'$ is isomorphic to the domain curve $E$, as is always the case for horizontal isogenies.\n\n### Part 4: The $j$-invariant of the Codomain Curve\n\nIn Part 2, we determined that the codomain curve $E'$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ has the Weierstrass model $y^{2}=x^{3}+x$. The $j$-invariant of a curve $y^{2}=x^{3}+Ax+B$ is given by the formula $j = 1728 \\frac{4A^{3}}{4A^{3}+27B^{2}}$.\nFor $E'$, we have $A=1$ and $B=0$. The $j$-invariant is:\n$$j(E') = 1728 \\frac{4(1)^{3}}{4(1)^{3}+27(0)^{2}} = 1728$$\nThis is the characteristic zero value of the $j$-invariant for this isomorphism class of elliptic curves. The isogeny $\\varphi$ is horizontal, which means $j(E') = j(E)$. The curve $E$ is the reduction modulo $5$ of $E_0/\\mathbb{Q}$, which was given to have $j(E_0)=1728$. The value of the $j$-invariant in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ is $1728 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5$. As the problem asks for the value of the $j$-invariant in exact form and relates objects over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_p$, the integral value from which the finite field value is derived is the most complete answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1728}$$", "id": "3010318"}]}
