I'll use the algebraic formula for point duplication.\n- For a point $P = (x_P, y_P)$ on the curve $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$, the point $2P = (x_{2P}, y_{2P})$ is given by:\n  $x_{2P} = m^2 - 2x_P$\n  $y_{2P} = m(x_P - x_{2P}) - y_P$\n  where $m = \\frac{3x_P^2 + A}{2y_P}$.\n- In my case, the curve is $y^2 = x^3 - 2$.

We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe elliptic curve $E$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the short Weierstrass equation $E: y^{2} = x^{3} - 4x$. This equation is of the form $y^{2} = x^{3} + Ax + B$ with integer coefficients $A = -4$ and $B = 0$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the curve is nonsingular by calculating its discriminant, $\\Delta$. The formula for the discriminant is $\\Delta = -16(4A^{3} + 27B^{2})$.\nSubstituting $A = -4$ and $B = 0$:\n$$\n\\Delta = -16(4(-4)^{3} + 27(0)^{2}) = -16(4(-64)) = -16(-256) = 4096\n$$\nSince $\\Delta = 4096 \\neq 0$, the curve is nonsingular and is indeed an elliptic curve.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$, which consists of all rational points on $E$ of finite order. The Mordell-Weil theorem states that $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is a finitely generated abelian group, so it has the structure $E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{r} \\oplus E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$, where $r$ is the rank and $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ is the finite torsion subgroup.\n\nTo find the torsion points, we use the Lutz-Nagell theorem. Since the coefficients $A = -4$ and $B = 0$ are integers, the theorem states that any non-identity torsion point $T = (x, y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ must have integer coordinates, i.e., $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, it requires that either $y = 0$ or $y^{2}$ must divide the discriminant $\\Delta = 4096$.\n\nWe examine these two cases to find all possible integer points on the curve.\n\nCase 1: $y = 0$.\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into the curve equation gives:\n$$\n0 = x^{3} - 4x = x(x^{2} - 4) = x(x - 2)(x + 2)\n$$\nThe integer solutions for $x$ are $x = 0$, $x = 2$, and $x = -2$. This gives us three points with integer coordinates:\n$T_1 = (0, 0)$, $T_2 = (2, 0)$, and $T_3 = (-2, 0)$.\nIn the group law for elliptic curves, points with a $y$-coordinate of $0$ are points of order $2$, because for such a point $P=(x,0)$, its inverse is $-P=(x,-0)=(x,0)=P$. Thus $2P = P+P = \\mathcal{O}$ (the point at infinity). Points of finite order are, by definition, torsion points. Therefore, $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, and $(-2,0)$ are all members of $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$.\n\nCase 2: $y \\neq 0$.\nAccording to the Lutz-Nagell theorem, $y$ must be an integer and $y^{2}$ must divide $\\Delta = 4096$. We know that $4096 = 2^{12}$.

The Mordell-Weil theorem states $E(K) \\cong E(K)_{\\mathrm{tors}} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^r$. The free part, $\\mathbb{Z}^r$, can be viewed as a lattice in the real vector space $V = (E(K)/E(K)_{\\mathrm{tors}}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. The Néron-Tate canonical height pairing $\\langle P, Q \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{h}(P+Q) - \\hat{h}(P) - \\hat{h}(Q))$ defines a symmetric bilinear form. The associated quadratic form is the height itself: $\\langle P, P \\rangle = \\hat{h}(P)$.\n3. A fundamental property of the canonical height is that $\\hat{h}(P) = 0$ if and only if $P$ is a torsion point. For any non-torsion point $P$, $\\hat{h}(P)>0$.\n4. Consequently, the Néron-Tate pairing induces a positive-definite inner product on the vector space $V$.\n5. A set of vectors $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_r\\}$ in an inner product space is linearly independent if and only if their Gram matrix $G = (\\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle)$ has a non-zero determinant. If the vectors are linearly independent, the Gram matrix is positive definite. If they are dependent, $\\det G = 0$. Thus, the conditions \"$G$ is positive definite\" and \"$\\det G \\ne 0$\" are equivalent for a set of linearly independent vectors in this context.\n6. The images of $P_1, \\dots, P_r$ in the torsion-free group $E(K)/E(K)_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ are independent over $\\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if they are independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is in turn equivalent to their images being linearly independent as vectors in the real vector space $V = (E(K)/E(K)_{\\mathrm{tors}}) \\otimes \\mathbb{R}$.\n7. Therefore, $\\det G \\ne 0$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the images of $P_1, \\dots, P_r$ in $E(K)/E(K)_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ to be linearly independent.\n8. Finally, we check the implication: does independence of the images $\\bar{P_i}$ in $E(K)/E(K)_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ imply $\\mathbb{Z}$-independence of the points $P_i$? Assume $\\sum_{i=1}^r n_i P_i = O$ for integers $n_i$. Projecting this relation to the quotient group $E(K)/E(K)_{\\mathrm{tors}}$, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^r n_i \\bar{P_i} = \\bar{O}$. If the images $\\{\\bar{P_i}\\}$ are linearly independent, it forces $n_i=0$ for all $i$. This is precisely the condition for the points $\\{P_i\\}$ to be independent over $\\mathbb{Z}$. So the implication holds.\n\nThe entire statement is a correct description of the standard procedure for checking linear independence of rational points on an elliptic curve.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**C. For $P\\in E(K)$, the equality $\\hat h(P)=0$ implies that $P$ is a torsion point in $E(K)$.**\n\nThis is a statement of Kronecker's theorem as applied to elliptic curves. A fundamental property of the Néron-Tate canonical height function $\\hat{h}$ on the group of points of an elliptic curve defined over a global field is that $\\hat{h}(P) \\ge 0$ for all points $P$, and $\\hat{h}(P) = 0$ if and only if $P$ is a point of finite order (a torsion point). The statement presents one direction of this equivalence (\"if\"). This direction is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**D. If the Gram determinant $\\det G$ of the canonical height pairing on $\\{P_1,\\dots,P_r\\}$ vanishes, then there exists a nontrivial integer relation $\\sum_{i=1}^r n_i P_i = O$ with coefficients $n_i\\in\\{-1,0,1\\}$.**\n\nIf $\\det G = 0$, the points $\\{P_1, \\dots, P_r\\}$ are linearly dependent modulo torsion. This means there exist integers $c_1, \\dots, c_r$, not all zero, such that $\\sum_{i=1}^r c_i P_i = T$ for some torsion point $T \\in E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$. Let $m > 0$ be the order of the point $T$, so $mT=O$. Multiplying the relation by $m$ gives $m(\\sum_{i=1}^r c_i P_i) = m T = O$, which simplifies to $\\sum_{i=1}^r (mc_i) P_i = O$. Setting $n_i = mc_i$, we obtain a non-trivial integer relation among the points $P_1, \\dots, P_r$.\n\nHowever, the statement makes the much stronger claim that a relation exists with coefficients restricted to $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This is false. Consider a point $P_1$ of infinite order and let $P_2 = 2 P_1$. The set $\\{P_1, P_2\\}$ is dependent over $\\mathbb{Z}$ since $2 P_1 - P_2 = O$. The images in $E(K)/E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ are dependent, so the Gram determinant for $\\{P_1, P_2\\}$ is zero. The non-trivial integer relations are of the form $k(2P_1 - P_2) = O$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The coefficients are $(2k, -k)$. There is no non-zero integer $k$ for which both $2k$ and $-k$ are in the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Hence, no such relation with coefficients in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ exists, disproving the statement.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**E. The Mordell–Weil theorem implies that $E(K)$ is a finite group, hence any infinite subset of $E(K)$ must be dependent over $\\mathbb{Z}$.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group $E(K)$ is *finitely generated*, not *finite*. A finitely generated abelian group has the structure $G_{\\text{tors}} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^r$, where $G_{\\text{tors}}$ is the finite torsion subgroup and $r \\ge 0$ is an integer called the rank. If the rank $r > 0$, the group $E(K)$ is infinite. For instance, any elliptic curve with rank $r \\ge 1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (and such curves are abundant) has infinitely many rational points. Therefore, the premise \"The Mordell–Weil theorem implies that $E(K)$ is a finite group\" is false. Because the initial premise is a misstatement of the theorem, the entire statement is incorrect.\n\nWhile the conclusion, \"any infinite subset of $E(K)$ must be dependent over $\\mathbb{Z}$,\" is true (as a consequence of $E(K)$ having finite rank $r$, any set of $r+1$ or more points must be linearly dependent), it does not rescue the statement, which is based on a false premise about the theorem itself.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3028231"}]}
