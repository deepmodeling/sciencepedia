We will proceed by addressing each of the four tasks in the order presented.\n\nThe homogeneous polynomial defining the projective curve $C$ is $F(X,Y,Z) = Y^{2} Z - X^{3} - X Z^{2} - 2 Z^{3}$. The point in question is $P = [1:2:1]$. First, we confirm that $P$ lies on the curve $C$ by substituting a representative set of homogeneous coordinates, $(1,2,1)$, into the polynomial:\n$$ F(1,2,1) = (2)^{2}(1) - (1)^{3} - (1)(1)^{2} - 2(1)^{3} = 4 - 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 $$\nSince the result is $0$, the point $P$ is indeed on the curve $C$.\n\n**Task 1: Verify that $P$ is a nonsingular point.**\n\nA point on a projective curve defined by $F(X,Y,Z)=0$ is nonsingular if the gradient of $F$ does not vanish at a representative of that point. We compute the partial derivatives of $F$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = -3X^{2} - Z^{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = 2YZ $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z} = Y^{2} - 2XZ - 6Z^{2} $$\nNext, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the representative coordinates $(1,2,1)$ for the point $P$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(1,2,1) = -3(1)^{2} - (1)^{2} = -3 - 1 = -4 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(1,2,1) = 2(2)(1) = 4 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(1,2,1) = (2)^{2} - 2(1)(1) - 6(1)^{2} = 4 - 2 - 6 = -4 $$\nThe projective gradient at $P$ is the vector of partials, $\\nabla F(P) = (-4, 4, -4)$. Since this vector is not the zero vector $(0,0,0)$, the point $P$ is a nonsingular point on the curve $C$.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the tangent line and justify that it passes through $P$.**\n\nThe tangent line to a projective curve $F=0$ at a nonsingular point $P_{0}=[X_{0}:Y_{0}:Z_{0}]$ is defined by the linear equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P_{0}) \\cdot X + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P_{0}) \\cdot Y + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P_{0}) \\cdot Z = 0 $$\nwhere the partials are evaluated at a representative of $P_0$. Using the gradient components calculated in Task 1 for the point $P=[1:2:1]$, the equation of the tangent line is:\n$$ (-4)X + (4)Y + (-4)Z = 0 $$\nDividing the entire equation by the common factor $-4$ yields the simplified form:\n$$ X - Y + Z = 0 $$\nThis is the equation of the projective tangent line to $C$ at $P$.\n\nTo justify from first principles that this line passes through $P$, we use Euler's homogeneous function theorem. The polynomial $F(X,Y,Z)$ is homogeneous of degree $d=3$. The theorem states that for any such polynomial:\n$$ X \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} + Y \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} + Z \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z} = d \\cdot F $$\nFor any point $P_{0}=[X_{0}:Y_{0}:Z_{0}]$ on the curve $C$, we have $F(X_{0},Y_{0},Z_{0})=0$ for any representative $(X_0, Y_0, Z_0)$. Substituting this into Euler's theorem, we get:\n$$ X_{0} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P_{0}) + Y_{0} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P_{0}) + Z_{0} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P_{0}) = 3 \\cdot F(P_{0}) = 3 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThis equation demonstrates that the coordinates of any representative of a point $P_{0}$ on the curve satisfy the equation of the line whose coefficients are the components of the gradient evaluated at that same point $P_{0}$. Thus, the point $P_{0}$ lies on its own tangent line. For our specific point $P=[1:2:1]$, this is:\n$$ (1) \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P)\\right) + (2) \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P)\\right) + (1) \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P)\\right) = (1)(-4) + (2)(4) + (1)(-4) = -4 + 8 - 4 = 0 $$\nThis confirms that $P$ is on the line $X - Y + Z = 0$.\n\n**Task 3: Dehomogenize and find the slope.**\n\nWe dehomogenize to the affine chart where $Z \\neq 0$ by setting $x = X/Z$ and $y = Y/Z$. To find the affine equation of the curve, we divide the homogeneous equation $Y^{2} Z - X^{3} - X Z^{2} - 2 Z^{3} = 0$ by $Z^{3}$:\n$$ \\frac{Y^{2}Z}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{X^{3}}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{XZ^{2}}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{2Z^{3}}{Z^{3}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{Z}\\right)^{2} - \\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right)^{3} - \\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right) - 2 = 0 $$\n$$ y^{2} = x^{3} + x + 2 $$\nThe projective point $P=[1:2:1]$ corresponds to the affine point $p=(x,y)=(1/1, 2/1) = (1,2)$.\n\nTo find the affine tangent line, we dehomogenize the projective tangent line equation $X - Y + Z = 0$. Since we are in the chart $Z \\neq 0$, we can divide by $Z$:\n$$ \\frac{X}{Z} - \\frac{Y}{Z} + \\frac{Z}{Z} = 0 $$\n$$ x - y + 1 = 0 $$\nThe problem asks for this line to be expressed in the form $y = mx + b$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ y = x + 1 $$\nBy comparing this to the form $y = mx + b$, we can identify the slope $m$ and the y-intercept $b$. The slope is $m=1$.\n\n**Task 4: Prove the well-definedness of the tangent line.**\n\nLet $P = [X_{P}:Y_{P}:Z_{P}]$ be a nonsingular point on the curve $C$. Any set of homogeneous coordinates for this point can be written as $(X_{P}, Y_{P}, Z_{P})$. Any other set of coordinates for the same point is of the form $(\\lambda X_{P}, \\lambda Y_{P}, \\lambda Z_{P})$ for some nonzero scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\times}$.\nThe polynomial $F$ is homogeneous of degree $d=3$. Its first-order partial derivatives, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}$, and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}$, are homogeneous polynomials of degree $d-1 = 2$.\nBy the definition of a homogeneous function of degree $k$, for any of these partial derivatives (let's use $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}$ as an example), we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(\\lambda X_{P}, \\lambda Y_{P}, \\lambda Z_{P}) = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(X_{P}, Y_{P}, Z_{P}) $$\nThe same relationship holds for the other partial derivatives. Therefore, the gradient vector evaluated using the new coordinates is:\n$$ \\nabla F(\\lambda X_{P}, \\lambda Y_{P}, \\lambda Z_{P}) = \\left(\\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P), \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P), \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P)\\right) = \\lambda^{2} \\nabla F(P) $$\nThe tangent line at $P$ is given by the linear form $L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = \\nabla F(P) \\cdot (X,Y,Z) = 0$.\nThe tangent line calculated using the new coordinates is given by the linear form $L_{P_{\\lambda}}(X,Y,Z) = \\nabla F(\\lambda X_P, \\lambda Y_P, \\lambda Z_P) \\cdot (X,Y,Z) = 0$.\nSubstituting the expression for the gradient, we get:\n$$ L_{P_{\\lambda}}(X,Y,Z) = (\\lambda^{2} \\nabla F(P)) \\cdot (X,Y,Z) = \\lambda^{2} (\\nabla F(P) \\cdot (X,Y,Z)) = \\lambda^{2} L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = 0 $$\nSince $\\lambda \\neq 0$, $\\lambda^{2} \\neq 0$. The equation $\\lambda^{2} L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = 0$ is equivalent to the equation $L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = 0$. This means that the set of points $[X:Y:Z]$ satisfying the linear form for the tangent calculated with the new coordinates is identical to the set of points satisfying the original linear form.\nIn projective geometry, two linear forms that are nonzero scalar multiples of each other define the same line. The vector of coefficients for the tangent line from the new coordinates is a nonzero scalar multiple of the original vector of coefficients. Therefore, both representatives of $P$ define the exact same projective tangent line. This completes the proof.\n\nThe final required answer is the slope $m$ determined in Task 3.\nThe slope is $m=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3012816"}, {"introduction": "Every elliptic curve in Weierstrass form has a distinguished point, $O = [0:1:0]$, which serves as the identity element for the group law.

This is the equation for the line at infinity in $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$. The homogeneous linear form $L(X,Y,Z)$ that defines this line is simply $Z$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must explain how this tangent direction relates to the vertical direction in the affine plane. We consider the affine chart defined by $Z=1$, where the coordinates are $(x,y)$ with $x=X/Z$ and $y=Y/Z$.\n\nA vertical line in this affine plane is defined by an equation of the form $x=c$ for some constant $c \\in k$. To understand its behavior in the projective plane, we homogenize this equation. Substituting $x=X/Z$, we get $X/Z=c$, which yields the homogeneous linear equation $X - cZ = 0$. This equation defines a line in $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$ that is the projective closure of the affine line $x=c$.\n\nTo find the \"direction\" of this family of parallel vertical lines, we find their common point of intersection in the projective plane. In projective geometry, parallel lines meet at a point on the line at infinity. The line at infinity is given by the equation $Z=0$. The intersection of a vertical line $X-cZ=0$ and the line at infinity $Z=0$ is found by solving the system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nX - cZ = 0 \\\\\nZ = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting $Z=0$ into the first equation immediately gives $X=0$. The coordinate $Y$ is not constrained by these equations. Thus, the intersection point is of the form $[0:Y:0]$. Since projective coordinates are homogeneous, we can scale by $Y^{-1}$ (for $Y \\neq 0$) to obtain the unique point $[0:1:0]$. This is precisely the point $O$.\n\nThis shows that the point $O=[0:1:0]$ on the curve $E$ is the point at infinity through which the projective closures of all vertical affine lines pass. Therefore, the point $O$ is the representation of the \"vertical direction\" in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$.\n\nThe connection is now clear: the tangent line to the curve $E$ *at the point that represents the vertical direction* (the point $O$) is the line $L(X,Y,Z)=Z=0$. In other words, the curve is tangent to the line at infinity at the point $O$.

Near the origin $(0,0)$, the term $1+x$ is non-zero. Since the field $k$ is algebraically closed and of characteristic $0$, we can take the square root of $1+x$ as a formal power series in $x$.

The origin $(0,0)$ corresponds to the parameter value $t=0$. This parametrization provides the normalization map. The local ring at the origin, $\\mathcal{O}_{P,C_0}$, is isomorphic to the subring $k[x,y]_{(x,y)}/(y^2-x^3)$. Its completion $\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}_{P,C_0}}$ is isomorphic to the subring of $k[[t]]$ generated by $t^2$ and $t^3$, which is $k[[t^2,t^3]]$. The normalization of this ring, $\\overline{\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}_{P,C_0}}}$, is isomorphic to $k[[t]]$.\nThe delta-invariant is:\n$$\n\\delta(P,C_0) = \\dim_k(\\overline{\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}_{P,C_0}}} / \\widehat{\\mathcal{O}_{P,C_0}}) = \\dim_k(k[[t]] / k[[t^2, t^3]])\n$$\nAn element of $k[[t^2, t^3]]$ is a power series of the form $f(t^2) + t^3 g(t^2)$ for some $f,g \\in k[[u]]$. Expanding this, we see it is a power series $\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty c_i t^i$ where the coefficient of $t^1$ must be zero, i.e., $c_1=0$.\n$$\nk[[t^2, t^3]] = \\{ c_0 + c_2 t^2 + c_3 t^3 + c_4 t^4 + \\dots \\} = \\left\\{ \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty c_i t^i \\in k[[t]] \\mid c_1 = 0 \\right\\}\n$$\nAny power series $f(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty c_i t^i \\in k[[t]]$ can be uniquely written as $f(t) = c_1 t + g(t)$, where $g(t) = f(t) - c_1 t \\in k[[t^2, t^3]]$. This implies that the quotient space $k[[t]] / k[[t^2, t^3]]$ is spanned by the image of $t$. The basis for this vector space is $\\{[t]\\}$, where $[t]$ is the equivalence class of $t$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the quotient space is $1$. So, $\\delta(P,C_0) = 1$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the sum $S$:\n$$\nS = \\delta(P,C_{0}) + \\delta(P,C_{1}) = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3012825"}]}
