First, we must derive the genus formula for a smooth projective plane curve of degree $d$. Second, we compute the geometric genus for a specific curve. Third, we relate the result to Faltings' theorem.\n\nPart 1: Genus of a smooth projective plane curve.\nLet $X = \\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$ be the projective plane over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$. Let $C \\subset X$ be a smooth projective curve defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$. In the language of divisors, $C$ is a divisor linearly equivalent to $dH$, where $H$ is the class of a hyperplane (a line) in $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$. We are given that the canonical divisor of the projective plane is $K_{\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}} \\sim -3H$.\n\nWe start with the adjunction formula for a smooth divisor $C$ on a smooth surface $X$, which states:\n$$K_C = (K_X + C)|_C$$\nHere, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of the curve $C$, and $K_X$ is the canonical divisor of the surface $X$. Substituting the given information for $X = \\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$ and $C \\sim dH$, we get:\n$$K_C \\sim (K_{\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}} + dH)|_C \\sim (-3H + dH)|_C \\sim ((d-3)H)|_C$$\nNext, we need to find the degree of the canonical divisor $K_C$. The problem specifies that the degree of a divisor on $C$ is computed by its intersection number with $H$. The degree of $K_C$ is the intersection number of the divisor $(d-3)H$ with $C$. By the properties of intersection theory on surfaces:\n$$\\deg(K_C) = ((d-3)H) \\cdot C$$\nSince $C$ is a curve of degree $d$, it is linearly equivalent to $dH$. Therefore, we can substitute $C$ with $dH$:\n$$\\deg(K_C) = ((d-3)H) \\cdot (dH) = d(d-3) (H \\cdot H)$$\nThe self-intersection number of a line in the projective plane is $H \\cdot H = H^2 = 1$, because two distinct lines intersect at exactly one point.\nThus, the degree of the canonical divisor of $C$ is:\n$$\\deg(K_C) = d(d-3)$$\nThe problem provides the degree-genus formula for a smooth projective curve $Y$: $2g(Y)-2 = \\deg K_{Y}$. Applying this to our curve $C$:\n$$2g(C) - 2 = d(d-3)$$\nSolving for the geometric genus $g(C)$:\n$$2g(C) = d(d-3) + 2 = d^2 - 3d + 2$$\n$$2g(C) = (d-1)(d-2)$$\n$$g(C) = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the genus of a smooth plane curve of degree $d$. The condition $d \\geq 3$ ensures that the genus is $g(C) \\geq \\frac{(2)(1)}{2} = 1$.\n\nPart 2: Genus of the specific curve $y^2 = x^5 - x + 1$.\nWe are given the affine curve $C_{\\mathrm{aff}} \\subset \\mathbb{A}^{2}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ defined by the equation $y^{2} = x^{5} - x + 1$. We need to find the geometric genus of its smooth projective model. First, we find the projective closure $\\overline{C} \\subset \\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. We homogenize the equation by introducing a variable $Z$ and setting $x = X/Z$ and $y = Y/Z$:\n$$(Y/Z)^2 = (X/Z)^5 - (X/Z) + 1$$\n$$Y^2/Z^2 = X^5/Z^5 - XZ^4/Z^5 + Z^5/Z^5$$\nMultiplying by $Z^5$ gives the homogeneous polynomial $F(X,Y,Z)$:\n$$F(X, Y, Z) = X^5 - Y^2Z^3 - XZ^4 + Z^5 = 0$$\nThis is a projective plane curve of degree $d=5$. The geometric genus $g$ of the smooth model of $\\overline{C}$ is given by the formula $g = p_a(\\overline{C}) - \\sum_{P} \\delta_P$, where $p_a(\\overline{C})$ is the arithmetic genus of the plane curve and $\\delta_P$ are the delta-invariants of its singular points $P$.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a plane curve of degree $d$ is given by the same formula we derived in Part 1:\n$$p_a(\\overline{C}) = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} = \\frac{(5-1)(5-2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2} = 6$$\nNext, we find the singular points of $\\overline{C}$ by solving the system of equations $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = 0$, and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z} = 0$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = 5X^4 - Z^4 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = -2YZ^3 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z} = -3Y^2Z^2 - 4XZ^3 + 5Z^4 = 0$$\nFrom the second equation, we have either $Y=0$ or $Z=0$.\nCase 1: $Z=0$. The first equation becomes $5X^4 = 0$, which implies $X=0$. The original equation $F(X,Y,Z)=0$ becomes $X^5=0$, which also implies $X=0$. This gives the point $[0:Y:0]$. Since points in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ are defined up to scaling, we can take $Y=1$. The point is $P=[0:1:0]$. Let's check if all partial derivatives vanish at $P$:\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(0,1,0) = 0$. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(0,1,0) = 0$. $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(0,1,0) = 0$.\nSo, $P=[0:1:0]$ is a singular point.\n\nCase 2: $Y=0$ and $Z \\neq 0$. We can set $Z=1$. The equations become:\n$5X^4 - 1 = 0 \\implies X^4 = 1/5$.\n$-4X + 5 = 0 \\implies X = 5/4$.\nSubstituting $X=5/4$ into the first equation: $(5/4)^4 = 625/256 \\neq 1/5$. There is no solution in this case.\nThus, the only singular point is $P=[0:1:0]$ on the line at infinity.\n\nNow we analyze the singularity at $P=[0:1:0]$. We dehomogenize by setting $Y=1$, with local coordinates $u=X/Y$ and $v=Z/Y$. The point $P$ corresponds to $(u,v)=(0,0)$. The equation becomes:\n$$F(u,1,v) = u^5 - (1)^2v^3 - uv^4 + v^5 = 0$$\n$$u^5 - v^3 - uv^4 + v^5 = 0$$\nThe lowest degree part of this polynomial is $-v^3$. We are given that for a singularity analytically equivalent to $v^m - u^n = 0$ with $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, the $\\delta$-invariant is $\\frac{(m-1)(n-1)}{2}$. The lowest degree terms in our local equation are $u^5$ and $-v^3$. This suggests the singularity is of the type $(n,m) = (5,3)$. We have $\\gcd(5,3)=1$. The higher order terms $-uv^4$ and $v^5$ do not change the local analytic type from $u^5 - v^3 = 0$. Thus, we can apply the given formula with $n=5$ and $m=3$.\n$$\\delta_P = \\frac{(5-1)(3-1)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 2}{2} = 4$$\nThe geometric genus of the smooth model is:\n$$g = p_a(\\overline{C}) - \\delta_P = 6 - 4 = 2$$\n\nPart 3: Consistency with Faltings' Theorem.\nThe curve $C_{\\mathrm{aff}}$ is defined over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}$. Mordell's conjecture, proved by Gerd Faltings and now known as Faltings' theorem, states that a smooth projective curve of genus $g > 1$ defined over a number field has only a finite number of rational points.\nWe computed the genus of the smooth projective model of our curve to be $g=2$. Since $g=2 > 1$, Faltings' theorem applies. It predicts that the curve $y^2 = x^5 - x + 1$ has at most a finite number of solutions $(x,y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are rational numbers. Our computed genus value is therefore consistent with the premise of the theorem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3019153"}, {"introduction": "Knowing that a curve has a finite number of rational points is one thing; finding them all is another, often much harder, challenge.

Determination of the Genus of $C$**\n\nThe genus of the curve $C$ is determined using the Riemann–Hurwitz theorem for the rational map $\\phi \\colon C \\to \\mathbb{P}^{1}$ defined by $(x,y) \\mapsto x$. This is a degree-$2$ cover. The Riemann–Hurwitz formula is:\n$$2g(C) - 2 = \\deg(\\phi) \\cdot (2g(\\mathbb{P}^{1}) - 2) + \\sum_{P \\in C} (e_P - 1)$$\nwhere $g(C)$ is the genus of $C$, $g(\\mathbb{P}^{1}) = 0$ is the genus of the projective line, $\\deg(\\phi)=2$ is the degree of the map, and $e_P$ is the ramification index of the map $\\phi$ at the point $P \\in C$.\n\nSubstituting the known values, the formula becomes:\n$$2g(C) - 2 = 2 \\cdot (2(0) - 2) + \\sum_{P \\in C} (e_P - 1) = -4 + \\sum_{P \\in C} (e_P - 1)$$\nRamification points are the points on $C$ where the fiber of the map $\\phi$ contains fewer than $\\deg(\\phi)=2$ points. For the map $(x,y) \\mapsto x$, the fiber over a point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{P}^1$ consists of the points $(x_0, y)$ on $C$ satisfying $y^2 = x_0^6 + 1$. This equation typically has two solutions for $y$, namely $y = \\pm\\sqrt{x_0^6+1}$. Ramification occurs when these two solutions coincide, which happens when $y=0$.\n\nSetting $y=0$ in the curve's equation gives $x^6 + 1 = 0$. The solutions are the $6$ distinct sixth roots of $-1$, which are $x_k = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\pi + 2k\\pi}{6}\\right)$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. These are the $6$ branch points of $\\phi$ in the affine plane. Above each of these branch points $x_k$, there is a single point $(x_k, 0)$ on $C$. Since the map has degree $2$, the ramification index $e_P$ at each of these $6$ points must be $2$. The contribution to the ramification term from these points is $\\sum (e_P - 1) = 6 \\cdot (2 - 1) = 6$.\n\nNext, we must analyze the behavior of the map at infinity. The smooth projective model $C$ must be considered. Let us change coordinates to study the point(s) at infinity. Let $x=1/u$. The curve equation becomes $y^2 = (1/u)^6 + 1 = \\frac{1+u^6}{u^6}$. We can rewrite this as $(yu^3)^2 = 1+u^6$. Let $v = yu^3$. The equation in the $(u,v)$ chart is $v^2 = u^6+1$. The point(s) at infinity on $C$ correspond to $x \\to \\infty$, which is $u \\to 0$. At $u=0$, we have $v^2=1$, which yields two distinct points: $(u,v)=(0,1)$ and $(u,v)=(0,-1)$. These are the two points at infinity on the smooth curve $C$.\n\nThe map $\\phi$ sends a point on $C$ to its $x$-coordinate. The point $\\infty \\in \\mathbb{P}^{1}$ corresponds to $x \\to \\infty$, which is $u \\to 0$. The fiber of $\\phi$ over $\\infty \\in \\mathbb{P}^{1}$ consists of the points on $C$ where $u=0$. We found two such points. Since the size of the fiber is $2$, which equals the degree of the map, the map $\\phi$ is unramified at infinity.\n\nThus, the entire ramification divisor consists of the $6$ finite points identified earlier. The sum of the ramification terms is $\\sum (e_P - 1) = 6$.\nPlugging this into the Riemann-Hurwitz formula:\n$$2g(C) - 2 = -4 + 6 = 2$$\n$$2g(C) = 4$$\n$$g(C) = 2$$\n\n**2. Application of Faltings' Theorem**\n\nFaltings' theorem, which settled Mordell's conjecture, states that any smooth projective curve of genus $g > 1$ defined over a number field $K$ has at most a finite number of $K$-rational points.\n\nIn our case, the curve $C$ is defined over the number field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We have determined its genus to be $g=2$. Since $g=2 > 1$, Faltings' theorem directly applies. Therefore, we can deduce that the set of rational points on the curve, $C(\\mathbb{Q})$, is a finite set.\n\n**3. Determination of the Rational Points $C(\\mathbb{Q})$**\n\nWe are given the curve $C$ with the affine model $y^2 = x^6+1$. Let us define new variables $(u,v)$ by $u=x^2$ and $v=y$. Substituting these into the equation for $C$ gives:\n$$v^2 = (x^2)^3 + 1 = u^3 + 1$$\nThe equation $v^2=u^3+1$ defines an elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We have thus constructed a rational morphism $\\pi \\colon C \\to E$ given by $\\pi(x,y) = (x^2, y)$.\n\nThis morphism provides a powerful constraint on the rational points of $C$. If $(x,y) \\in C(\\mathbb{Q})$, then $x$ and $y$ are rational numbers. The image point $\\pi(x,y) = (x^2, y)$ must be a rational point on the elliptic curve $E$, i.e., $(u,v) = (x^2, y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$. Critically, the $u$-coordinate of this point on $E$ must be the square of a rational number.\n\nThe structure of the Mordell-Weil group $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is a known result in the theory of elliptic curves. The rank of $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is $0$, and its torsion subgroup is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. This can be established using descent methods (for instance, a 3-descent, appropriate for a $j=0$ curve, or a more general 2-descent). The set of rational points on $E$ is:\n$$E(\\mathbb{Q}) = \\{ \\mathcal{O}, (2, 3), (2, -3), (0, 1), (0, -1), (-1, 0) \\}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity.\n\nWe now check which of these points have a $u$-coordinate that is a square of a rational number:\n- The point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$: This point corresponds to $u \\to \\infty$. This will be the image of points at infinity on $C$.\n- The points $(2, 3)$ and $(2, -3)$: The $u$-coordinate is $u=2$. Since $2$ is not the square of any rational number, these points on $E$ are not images of any point in $C(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n- The points $(0, 1)$ and $(0, -1)$: The $u$-coordinate is $u=0$. This is the square of the rational number $0$, i.e., $0=0^2$. This condition is met.\n- The point $(-1, 0)$: The $u$-coordinate is $u=-1$. A square of a rational number cannot be negative. This point is not an image of a point in $C(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nWe now find the preimages on $C$ for the valid cases.\nCase 1: The image is $(0,1)$ or $(0,-1)$.\nThis implies $u = x^2 = 0$, so $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the equation for $C$, we get $y^2 = 0^6 + 1 = 1$, which gives $y = \\pm 1$.\nThis yields two affine rational points on $C$:\n- $(0, 1)$, which maps to $(0^2, 1) = (0, 1) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n- $(0, -1)$, which maps to $(0^2, -1) = (0, -1) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nCase 2: The image is $\\mathcal{O} \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\nA point on $C$ maps to the point at infinity on $E$ if its $u=x^2$ coordinate is infinite. This happens if $x$ is infinite, which means we are considering the points at infinity on $C$. As established in Part 1, the smooth curve $C$ has two points at infinity, corresponding to $(u,v) = (0, \\pm 1)$ in the chart defined by $v^2=u^6+1$. These two points have rational coordinates in this chart and are defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so they are rational points of $C$. Let us denote them by $P_{\\infty,+}$ and $P_{\\infty,-}$. Both of these points map to the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ under $\\pi$.\n\nIn total, we have found four rational points on the smooth projective curve $C$:\n1. The affine point $(0,1)$.\n2.

The cardinality of this set is $|C(\\mathbb{Q})|=4$.\nThe rank of the Jacobian of $C$, $J(C)$, is $0$, which is strictly less than the genus $g=2$.

A zero of $F(t)$ for $t \\ne 0$ must be a zero of $G(t)$.\n    Let's analyze the $3$-adic absolute values of the coefficients of $G(t)$. The constant term is $-\\frac{2}{3}$, and its $3$-adic absolute value is $|-2/3|_3 = |3^{-1}|_3 = 3$. For any $t$ such that $|t|_3 < 1$, the absolute value of the next term is $|-\\frac{1}{11}t^8|_3 = |-\\frac{1}{11}|_3 |t|_3^8 = 1 \\cdot |t|_3^8 \\le (\\frac{1}{3})^8 < 1$.\n    All subsequent terms are even smaller. By the strong triangle inequality, for $|t|_3 < 1$, $|G(t)|_3 = |-\\frac{2}{3}|_3 = 3$.\n    Since $|G(t)|_3 \\ne 0$, $G(t)$ has no zeros in the disk $|t|_3 < 1$. Thus, the only zero of $F(t)$ in this disk is $t=0$, which corresponds to the point at infinity. So, $\\infty$ is the only rational point in this residue disc.\n\n2.  **Residue discs above finite points $(x_0, 0)$**\n    For the points where $y=0$, we have $x_0 \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$. These are branch points of the map $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1, (x,y) \\mapsto x$. A good local parameter near such a point $P_0=(x_0,0)$ is $t=y$. From $y^2 = f(x) = x^5-x$, we have $2y\\,dy = f'(x)dx$, so $\\omega = \\frac{dx}{y} = \\frac{2dy}{f'(x)} = \\frac{2dt}{5x^4-1}$. We need to express $x$ as a power series in $t$. Near $(x_0,0)$, $y^2 \\approx f'(x_0)(x-x_0)$, so $x-x_0 \\approx \\frac{y^2}{f'(x_0)} = \\frac{t^2}{f'(x_0)}$.\n    The function whose zeros we seek is $F(P) = \\int_{\\infty}^P \\omega$. For a point $P$ in the residue disc of $P_0$, this is $F(P) = F(P_0) + \\int_{P_0}^P \\omega$. Since $P_0$ is a rational point, $F(P_0)=0$. Thus, we need to find the zeros of the local integral $H(t) = \\int_0^t \\frac{2\\,d\\tau}{5x(\\tau)^4-1}$.\n\n    a. **Disc at $(0,0)$**: Here $x_0=0$. $f'(0) = 5(0)^4-1=-1$. So $x-0 \\approx \\frac{t^2}{-1}$, which means $x(t) = -t^2 + O(t^4)$.\n    The integrand is $\\frac{2}{5x(t)^4-1} = \\frac{2}{5(-t^2+\\dots)^4-1} = \\frac{2}{-1+O(t^8)} = -2+O(t^8)$.\n    $H(t) = \\int_0^t (-2 + O(\\tau^8)) d\\tau = -2t + O(t^9)$.\n    The series $H(t)=-2t+\\dots$ has only one zero at $t=0$ in the disc $|t|_3<1$, because $|-2|_3=1$ and all other coefficients are integers, so for $|t|_3<1$ the first term dominates. This zero corresponds to the point $(0,0)$.\n\n    b. **Disc at $(1,0)$**: Here $x_0=1$. $f'(1) = 5(1)^4-1=4$. So $x-1 \\approx \\frac{t^2}{4}$, which gives $x(t) = 1 + \\frac{1}{4}t^2 + O(t^4)$.\n    The integrand is $\\frac{2}{5x(t)^4-1} = \\frac{2}{5(1+\\frac{1}{4}t^2+\\dots)^4-1} = \\frac{2}{5(1+t^2+\\dots)-1} = \\frac{2}{4+5t^2+\\dots} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{5}{4}t^2+\\dots)$.\n    $H(t) = \\int_0^t \\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{5}{8}\\tau^2+\\dots\\right)d\\tau = \\frac{1}{2}t - \\frac{5}{24}t^3 + \\dots$.\n    We are looking for zeros of $H(t)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{Q}_3$ with $|t|_3<1$. $t=0$ is one solution, corresponding to $(1,0)$. For other solutions, we analyze $G(t)=H(t)/t = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{5}{24}t^2 + \\dots$.\n    The constant term is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Its $3$-adic absolute value is $|\\frac{1}{2}|_3=1$. For $|t|_3<1$, subsequent terms are small: $|-\\frac{5}{24}t^2|_3 = |-\\frac{5}{8 \\cdot 3}|_3 |t|_3^2 = 3|t|_3^2 \\le 3(\\frac{1}{3})^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$. By the strong triangle inequality, $|G(t)|_3 = |\\frac{1}{2}|_3 = 1$. Thus, $G(t)$ has no zeros for $|t|_3<1$. The only rational point in this disc is $(1,0)$.\n\n    c. **Disc at $(-1,0)$**: Here $x_0=-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. $f'(-1) = 5(-1)^4-1=4$. So $x-(-1) \\approx \\frac{t^2}{4}$, giving $x(t) = -1 + \\frac{1}{4}t^2 + O(t^4)$.\n    The integrand is $\\frac{2}{5x(t)^4-1} = \\frac{2}{5(-1+\\frac{1}{4}t^2+\\dots)^4-1} = \\frac{2}{5(1-t^2+\\dots)-1} = \\frac{2}{4-5t^2+\\dots} = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac{5}{4}t^2+\\dots)$.\n    $H(t) = \\int_0^t \\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{5}{8}\\tau^2+\\dots\\right)d\\tau = \\frac{1}{2}t + \\frac{5}{24}t^3 + \\dots$.\n    Similarly to the case $x_0=1$, the function $G(t)=H(t)/t = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{5}{24}t^2 + \\dots$ has no zeros for $|t|_3<1$. The only rational point in this disc is $(-1,0)$.\n\nCombining the results from all four residue discs, we have shown that each disc contains exactly one rational point, and these are the points we initially identified.\nTherefore, the set of rational points on $C$ is $C(\\mathbb{Q}) = \\{\\infty, (0,0), (1,0), (-1,0)\\}$.\n\nThe final step is to compute the sum $S = \\sum_{P \\in C(\\mathbb{Q}) \\cap \\mathbb{A}^{1}} x(P)$.\nThe affine rational points are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(-1,0)$. Their $x$-coordinates are $0$, $1$, and $-1$.\nThe sum is $S = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3019141"}]}
