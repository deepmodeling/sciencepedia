It follows that:\n$$ a_{q} = - \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}} \\left(\\frac{f(x)}{q}\\right) $$\n\n**Analysis of $E_{1}: y^{2} = x^{3} - x$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$**\n\nThe function is $f_{1}(x) = x^{3} - x$. We need to compute $a_{11}(E_{1}) = -\\sum_{x=0}^{10} \\left(\\frac{x^{3}-x}{11}\\right)$.\nThe quadratic residues modulo $11$ are $1^{2}=1$, $2^{2}=4$, $3^{2}=9$, $4^{2}=16\\equiv 5$, and $5^{2}=25\\equiv 3$. So, $\\text{QR}_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nWe can compute the sum directly:\n$\\left(\\frac{0^{3}-0}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{0}{11}\\right) = 0$\n$\\left(\\frac{1^{3}-1}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{0}{11}\\right) = 0$\n$\\left(\\frac{2^{3}-2}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{11}\\right) = -1$\n$\\left(\\frac{3^{3}-3}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{24}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{11}\\right) = -1$\n$\\left(\\frac{4^{3}-4}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{60}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{11}\\right) = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{5^{3}-5}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{120}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right) = -1$\n$\\left(\\frac{6^{3}-6}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{210}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{11}\\right) = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{7^{3}-7}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{336}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{11}\\right) = -1$\n$\\left(\\frac{8^{3}-8}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{504}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{9}{11}\\right) = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{9^{3}-9}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{720}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{11}\\right) = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{10^{3}-10}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{990}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{0}{11}\\right) = 0$\nThe sum is $0+0-1-1+1-1+1-1+1+1+0 = 0$.\nThus, $a_{11}(E_{1}) = -0 = 0$.\nThe number of points is $\\#E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) = 11 + 1 - a_{11}(E_{1}) = 12 - 0 = 12$.\n\nAlternatively, for a prime $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, it is a known result that for the curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$, the trace of Frobenius $a_{p}$ is $0$. Since $p=11 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we have $a_{11}(E_{1})=0$, which confirms the direct calculation. This gives $\\#E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) = p+1 = 12$.\n\n**Analysis of $E_{2}: y^{2} = x^{3} - 1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$**\n\nThe function is $f_{2}(x) = x^{3} - 1$. We compute $a_{11}(E_{2}) = -\\sum_{x=0}^{10} \\left(\\frac{x^{3}-1}{11}\\right)$.\nA known result for primes $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ is that the map $x \\mapsto x^3$ is a permutation of $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. This is because $\\text{gcd}(3, p-1) = 1$. For $p=11$, we have $p-1=10$, and $\\text{gcd}(3, 10)=1$.\nTherefore, as $x$ runs through all elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, so does $u=x^3$. The sum becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{11}} \\left(\\frac{x^{3}-1}{11}\\right) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{F}_{11}} \\left(\\frac{u-1}{11}\\right) $$\nLetting $v=u-1$, as $u$ runs through $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, so does $v$. The sum is then:\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in \\mathbb{F}_{11}} \\left(\\frac{v}{11}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe sum of Legendre symbols over all elements of a finite field is always zero.\nThus, $a_{11}(E_{2}) = 0$.\nThe number of points is $\\#E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) = 11 + 1 - a_{11}(E_{2}) = 12 - 0 = 12$.\n\n**Supersingularity**\n\nAn elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is defined as supersingular if the trace of Frobenius $a_{p}$ satisfies $a_{p} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ (for $p \\geq 5$).\nFor $E_{1}$, we found $a_{11}(E_{1}) = 0$. Since $11$ divides $0$, $E_{1}$ is supersingular over $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$.\nFor $E_{2}$, we found $a_{11}(E_{2}) = 0$. Since $11$ divides $0$, $E_{2}$ is also supersingular over $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$.\n\n**Point counts over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}$**\n\nThe number of points on an elliptic curve $E$ over an extension field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}$ is determined by the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism, $P(T) = T^{2} - a_{p}T + p$. Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be the roots of this polynomial. Then the number of points is given by:\n$$ \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}) = p^{n} + 1 - (\\alpha^{n} + \\beta^{n}) $$\nThe term $a_{p^{n}} = \\alpha^{n} + \\beta^{n}$ is the trace of Frobenius over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.\nWe are interested in $n=2$. We have $a_{p} = \\alpha + \\beta$ and $p = \\alpha\\beta$.\nThe trace over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ is $a_{p^{2}} = \\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} = (\\alpha+\\beta)^{2} - 2\\alpha\\beta = a_{p}^{2} - 2p$.\nFor both $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, we have $p=11$ and $a_{11}=0$.\nThus, for both curves, the trace over $\\mathbb{F}_{11^2}$ is $a_{11^{2}} = 0^{2} - 2(11) = -22$.\nThe number of points on $E_{1}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}} = \\mathbb{F}_{121}$ is:\n$$ \\#E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}}) = 11^{2} + 1 - a_{11^{2}} = 121 + 1 - (-22) = 122 + 22 = 144 $$\nSimilarly, the number of points on $E_{2}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}}$ is:\n$$ \\#E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}}) = 11^{2} + 1 - a_{11^{2}} = 121 + 1 - (-22) = 144 $$\n\n**Verification of Hasse's Bound**\n\nHasse's theorem states that for an elliptic curve $E$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, the number of points is bounded by:\n$$ | \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q}) - (q+1) | \\leq 2\\sqrt{q} $$\nThis is equivalent to $|a_{q}| \\le 2\\sqrt{q}$.\n\nCase 1: $E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$\n$q=11$, $\\#E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11})=12$. $|12 - (11+1)| = 0$. The bound is $2\\sqrt{11} \\approx 6.63$. $0 \\leq 2\\sqrt{11}$ is true.\n\nCase 2: $E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}})$\n$q=121$, $\\#E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{121})=144$. $|144 - (121+1)| = |22| = 22$. The bound is $2\\sqrt{121} = 2 \\times 11 = 22$. $22 \\leq 22$ is true. The bound is met with equality.\n\nCase 3: $E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$\n$q=11$, $\\#E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{11})=12$. $|12 - (11+1)| = 0$. The bound is $2\\sqrt{11}$. $0 \\leq 2\\sqrt{11}$ is true.\n\nCase 4: $E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}})$\n$q=121$, $\\#E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{121})=144$. $|144 - (121+1)| = |22| = 22$. The bound is $2\\sqrt{121} = 22$. $22 \\leq 22$ is true. The bound is met with equality.\n\nThe cases where Hasse's bound is met with equality are for both curves over the extension field $\\mathbb{F}_{11^2}$. This occurs because the Frobenius trace $a_{11}$ is zero, which is a key property of these supersingular curves for this specific prime.\n\nFinal list of computed values:\n$\\#E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) = 12$\n$\\#E_{1}(\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}}) = 144$\n$\\#E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{11}) = 12$\n$\\#E_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{11^{2}}) = 144$\nThese will be presented in a row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 144 & 12 & 144 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "3012957"}]}
