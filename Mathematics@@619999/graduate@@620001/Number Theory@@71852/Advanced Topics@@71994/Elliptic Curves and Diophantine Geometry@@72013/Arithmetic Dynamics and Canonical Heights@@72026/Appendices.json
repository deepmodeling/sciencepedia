A crucial consequence is that if $|x|_v \\ne |y|_v$, then the inequality becomes an equality: $|x+y|_v = \\max\\{|x|_v, |y|_v\\}$.\n\nWe analyze the behavior of the iterates $|f^n(z)|_v$ based on the magnitude of $|c|_v$.\n\n**Case 1: $|c|_v \\leq 1$**\n\nWe partition the analysis based on the magnitude of $|z|_v$.\n\n*   **Subcase 1a: $|z|_v > 1$**\n    Since $d \\ge 2$, we have $|z^d|_v = |z|_v^d > |z|_v > 1$. Given that $|c|_v \\le 1$, it follows that $|z^d|_v > |c|_v$. The strong triangle inequality implies:\n    $$\n    |f(z)|_v = |z^d + c|_v = \\max\\{|z^d|_v, |c|_v\\} = |z|_v^d\n    $$\n    Let $z_1 = f(z)$. We have $|z_1|_v = |z|_v^d > 1$. We can apply the same argument to $z_1$ to find $|f(z_1)|_v = |z_1|_v^d$. This means $|f^2(z)|_v = (|z|_v^d)^d = |z|_v^{d^2}$.\n    By induction, for any integer $n \\ge 1$, if $|f^{n-1}(z)|_v = |z|_v^{d^{n-1}} > 1$, then\n    $$\n    |f^n(z)|_v = |f(f^{n-1}(z))|_v = |f^{n-1}(z)|_v^d = (|z|_v^{d^{n-1}})^d = |z|_v^{d^n}\n    $$\n    Since $|z|_v > 1$, the hypothesis $|f^{n-1}(z)|_v > 1$ holds for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $|f^n(z)|_v = |z|_v^{d^n}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    Since $|z|_v > 1$, $|f^n(z)|_v > 1$ for all $n$. Therefore, $\\max\\{1, |f^n(z)|_v\\} = |f^n(z)|_v$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of the canonical height:\n    $$\n    \\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{d^n} \\ln(|z|_v^{d^n}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{d^n}{d^n} \\ln|z|_v = \\ln|z|_v\n    $$\n\n*   **Subcase 1b: $|z|_v \\leq 1$**\n    In this case, $|z^d|_v = |z|_v^d \\le 1^d = 1$.

The strong triangle inequality gives:\n    $$\n    |f(z)|_v = |z^d + c|_v = \\max\\{|z^d|_v, |c|_v\\} = |z|_v^d\n    $$\n    Let $z_1 = f(z)$. We have $|z_1|_v = |z|_v^d$. To apply induction, we must check if $|z_1|_v > |c|_v^{1/d}$.\n    $|z_1|_v = |z|_v^d > (|c|_v^{1/d})^d = |c|_v$. Since $|c|_v > |c|_v^{1/d}$, the condition is satisfied.\n    By induction, we have $|f^n(z)|_v = |z|_v^{d^n}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    Since $|z|_v > |c|_v^{1/d} > 1$, we have $|f^n(z)|_v > 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$. So $\\max\\{1, |f^n(z)|_v\\} = |f^n(z)|_v$.\n    The canonical height is:\n    $$\n    \\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{d^n} \\ln(|z|_v^{d^n}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{d^n}{d^n} \\ln|z|_v = \\ln|z|_v\n    $$\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: $|z|_v < |c|_v^{1/d}$**\n    This implies $|z^d|_v = |z|_v^d < |c|_v$. The strong triangle inequality gives:\n    $$\n    |f(z)|_v = |z^d + c|_v = \\max\\{|z^d|_v, |c|_v\\} = |c|_v\n    $$\n    Let $z_1 = f(z)$. We have $|z_1|_v = |c|_v$. Since $|c|_v > |c|_v^{1/d}$, the point $z_1$ falls into Subcase 2a.\n    We can now compute $\\lambda_{v,f}(z)$ using a fundamental property of canonical heights, the functional equation $\\lambda_{v,f}(f(z)) = d \\cdot \\lambda_{v,f}(z)$. This equation follows directly from the definition of the limit.\n    Applying this equation, we get $\\lambda_{v,f}(z) = d^{-1}\\lambda_{v,f}(f(z)) = d^{-1}\\lambda_{v,f}(z_1)$.\n    Since $|z_1|_v = |c|_v > |c|_v^{1/d}$, we can use the result from Subcase 2a to find $\\lambda_{v,f}(z_1)$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda_{v,f}(z_1) = \\ln|z_1|_v = \\ln|c|_v\n    $$\n    Therefore, for $|z|_v < |c|_v^{1/d}$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\frac{1}{d} \\ln|c|_v\n    $$\n\n*   **Subcase 2c: $|z|_v = |c|_v^{1/d}$**\n    In this boundary case, $|z^d|_v = |c|_v$, so the strong triangle inequality does not apply. We only have the upper bound $|f(z)|_v = |z^d+c|_v \\le \\max\\{|z^d|_v, |c|_v\\} = |c|_v$. The exact value of $|f(z)|_v$ depends on potential cancellation between $z^d$ and $c$, which requires more information than just their absolute values. However, the canonical height function $\\lambda_{v,f}(z)$ is known to be continuous on $\\mathbb{A}^1(K_v)$. We can thus find the value at this boundary by taking the limit from either side.\n    From Subcase 2a, as $|z|_v \\to (|c|_v^{1/d})^+$, we have $\\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\ln|z|_v \\to \\ln(|c|_v^{1/d}) = \\frac{1}{d}\\ln|c|_v$.\n    From Subcase 2b, as $|z|_v \\to (|c|_v^{1/d})^-$, we have $\\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\frac{1}{d}\\ln|c|_v$.\n    Since both limits agree, by continuity, the value at $|z|_v = |c|_v^{1/d}$ must be:\n    $$\n    \\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\frac{1}{d}\\ln|c|_v\n    $$\n\nCombining these subcases for $|c|_v > 1$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\begin{cases} \\ln|z|_v & \\text{if } |z|_v > |c|_v^{1/d} \\\\ \\frac{1}{d}\\ln|c|_v & \\text{if } |z|_v \\le |c|_v^{1/d} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be expressed more compactly as $\\lambda_{v,f}(z) = \\ln(\\max\\{|z|_v, |c|_v^{1/d}\\})$.\n\nTo summarize, we have derived the explicit formulas for the two specified regimes.

Second, we must compute the value of the local canonical height $\\widehat{\\lambda}_{f,p}$ at the point $z=p$.\n\nPart 1: Justification of Bad Reduction\n\nThe rational map $f(z) = \\frac{z^d + p}{z^d}$ is given by the homogeneous lift $\\Phi(X,Y) = \\big(F_{0}(X,Y), F_{1}(X,Y)\\big)$, where $F_{0}(X,Y) = X^{d} + p\\,Y^{d}$ and $F_{1}(X,Y) = X^{d}$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$. The degree of the map $f$ is $\\deg(f) = d$, since the polynomials $F_0$ and $F_1$ are coprime over $\\mathbb{Q}(X,Y)$. If they had a common factor, it would have to be a power of $X$, since $F_1=X^d$. However, $X$ does not divide $F_0 = X^d + pY^d$ as $p \\neq 0$.\n\nTo analyze the reduction of $f$ at the prime $p$, we reduce the coefficients of the polynomials $F_0$ and $F_1$ modulo $p$.

The components $\\widetilde{F}_0$ and $\\widetilde{F}_1$ share a common factor of $X^d$. The degree of the reduced map $\\tilde{f}$ is the degree of the polynomials after canceling all common factors. On the open set where $X \\neq 0$, the map is $[X^d : X^d] = [1:1]$, which is a constant map. After removing the common factor $X^d$, the resulting polynomials are $(1,1)$, which are of degree $0$.

Let's choose the initial representative $(X_0, Y_0) = (p, 1)$.\n\nThe norm is the $p$-adic supremum norm, $\\|(X,Y)\\|_p = \\max\\{|X|_p, |Y|_p\\}$. The $p$-adic absolute value is related to the $p$-adic valuation $v_p$ by $|x|_p = p^{-v_p(x)}$. Thus, $\\ln\\|(X,Y)\\|_p = -\\min\\{v_p(X), v_p(Y)\\}\\ln(p)$. Our goal reduces to finding the long-term behavior of $v_n = \\min\\{v_p(X_n), v_p(Y_n)\\}$.\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the sequence $(X_n, Y_n)$ and their valuations.\nFor $n=0$:\n$(X_0, Y_0) = (p, 1)$.\n$v_p(X_0) = v_p(p) = 1$.\n$v_p(Y_0) = v_p(1) = 0$.\n$v_0 = \\min\\{1, 0\\} = 0$.\n\nFor $n=1$:\n$(X_1, Y_1) = \\Phi(X_0, Y_0) = \\Phi(p, 1) = (p^d + p(1)^d, p^d) = (p^d+p, p^d)$.\nSince $d \\ge 2$, $p^{d-1}$ is an integer divisible by $p$. So $p^{d-1}+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, which means $v_p(p^{d-1}+1) = 0$.\n$v_p(X_1) = v_p(p^d+p) = v_p(p(p^{d-1}+1)) = v_p(p) + v_p(p^{d-1}+1) = 1+0=1$.\n$v_p(Y_1) = v_p(p^d) = d$.\n$v_1 = \\min\\{1, d\\} = 1$.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n$(X_2, Y_2) = \\Phi(X_1, Y_1) = (X_1^d + pY_1^d, X_1^d)$.\n$v_p(X_1^d) = d \\cdot v_p(X_1) = d \\cdot 1 = d$.\n$v_p(p Y_1^d) = v_p(p) + d \\cdot v_p(Y_1) = 1 + d \\cdot d = 1+d^2$.\nUsing the property $v_p(a+b) = \\min\\{v_p(a), v_p(b)\\}$ when $v_p(a) \\neq v_p(b)$:\n$v_p(X_2) = v_p(X_1^d + pY_1^d) = \\min\\{v_p(X_1^d), v_p(p Y_1^d)\\} = \\min\\{d, 1+d^2\\} = d$ (since $d \\ge 2$).\n$v_p(Y_2) = v_p(X_1^d) = d$.\n$v_2 = \\min\\{d, d\\} = d = d^{2-1}$.\n\nFor $n=3$:\n$(X_3, Y_3) = \\Phi(X_2, Y_2) = (X_2^d + pY_2^d, X_2^d)$.\nFrom the previous step, $v_p(X_2) = d$ and $v_p(Y_2) = d$.\n$v_p(X_2^d) = d \\cdot v_p(X_2) = d \\cdot d = d^2$.\n$v_p(p Y_2^d) = 1 + d \\cdot v_p(Y_2) = 1 + d \\cdot d = 1+d^2$.\n$v_p(X_3) = v_p(X_2^d + pY_2^d) = \\min\\{d^2, 1+d^2\\} = d^2$.\n$v_p(Y_3) = v_p(X_2^d) = d^2$.\n$v_3 = \\min\\{d^2, d^2\\} = d^2 = d^{3-1}$.\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging. For $n \\ge 2$, it appears that $v_p(X_n) = v_p(Y_n) = d^{n-1}$, and thus $v_n = d^{n-1}$. We prove this by induction for $n \\ge 2$.\nBase case ($n=2$): We have already shown $v_p(X_2)=v_p(Y_2)=d=d^{2-1}$.\nInductive step: Assume for some $n \\ge 2$ that $v_p(X_n) = v_p(Y_n) = d^{n-1}$. Let us compute the valuations for $n+1$.\n$v_p(X_{n+1}) = v_p(X_n^d + pY_n^d) = \\min\\{d \\cdot v_p(X_n), 1 + d \\cdot v_p(Y_n)\\}$.\nUsing the hypothesis:\n$v_p(X_{n+1}) = \\min\\{d \\cdot d^{n-1}, 1 + d \\cdot d^{n-1}\\} = \\min\\{d^n, 1+d^n\\} = d^n$.\n$v_p(Y_{n+1}) = v_p(X_n^d) = d \\cdot v_p(X_n) = d \\cdot d^{n-1} = d^n$.\nThus, $v_p(X_{n+1}) = v_p(Y_{n+1}) = d^n = d^{(n+1)-1}$. The induction is complete.\n\nSo, the minimum valuation sequence is $v_0=0$, $v_1=1$, and $v_n=d^{n-1}$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\nNow we compute the limit:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\lambda}_{f,p}(p) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d^{-n} \\ln \\|(X_n, Y_n)\\|_p = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d^{-n} \\big( -v_n \\ln p \\big)\n$$\nSince the limit depends on the behavior for large $n$, we can use the formula for $v_n$ for $n \\ge 2$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\lambda}_{f,p}(p) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d^{-n} \\big( -d^{n-1} \\ln p \\big) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{d^{n-1}}{d^n} \\ln p \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{d} \\ln p \\right) = -\\frac{\\ln p}{d}\n$$\nThe final value for the local canonical height is $-\\frac{\\ln p}{d}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{\\ln(p)}{d}}\n$$", "id": "3008193"}]}
