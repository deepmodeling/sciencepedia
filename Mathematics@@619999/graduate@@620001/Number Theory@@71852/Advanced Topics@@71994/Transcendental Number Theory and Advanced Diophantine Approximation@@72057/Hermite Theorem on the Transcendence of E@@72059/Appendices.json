Provide the final answer as a single exact number (no rounding).", "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. The first part establishes a general property of polynomials with integer coefficients, and the second part applies this property to a specific example.\n\n#### Part 1: Verification of the Integrality Property\nLet $P(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients. This means $P(x)$ can be written in the form:\n$$\nP(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{n} a_m x^m\n$$\nwhere each coefficient $a_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $n$ is the degree of the polynomial.\n\nThe task is to verify that $P^{(k)}(0)$ is an integer for any non-negative integer $k$. We are to use the linearity of differentiation and the power rule.\n\nFirst, consider the $k$-th derivative of a monomial term, $x^m$. Repeated application of the power rule, $\\frac{d}{dx}x^p = px^{p-1}$, gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^k}{dx^k} (x^m) = m(m-1)(m-2)\\cdots(m-k+1) x^{m-k}\n$$\nThis expression can be written using factorials as $\\frac{m!}{(m-k)!} x^{m-k}$ for $k \\le m$. If $k  m$, the $k$-th derivative of $x^m$ is $0$, since differentiating a constant (which is reached after $m+1$ differentiations) yields $0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this derivative at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^k}{dx^k} (x^m) \\right|_{x=0}\n$$\n- If $m  k$, the derivative is identically $0$, so its value at $x=0$ is $0$.\n- If $m  k$, the exponent $m-k$ is a positive integer. Evaluating $x^{m-k}$ at $x=0$ gives $0^{m-k} = 0$.\n- If $m = k$, the derivative is $\\frac{k!}{(k-k)!} x^{k-k} = \\frac{k!}{0!} x^0 = k!$. Its value at $x=0$ is $k!$.\n\nWe can summarize this result using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{mk}$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^k}{dx^k} (x^m) \\right|_{x=0} = k! \\, \\delta_{mk}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{mk} = 1$ if $m=k$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nNow, we apply this to the full polynomial $P(x)$. By the linearity of the differentiation operator, we can differentiate term by term:\n$$\nP^{(k)}(x) = \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{n} a_m x^m \\right)^{(k)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{n} a_m \\frac{d^k}{dx^k}(x^m)\n$$\nEvaluating at $x=0$:\n$$\nP^{(k)}(0) = \\sum_{m=0}^{n} a_m \\left. \\frac{d^k}{dx^k}(x^m) \\right|_{x=0} = \\sum_{m=0}^{n} a_m (k! \\, \\delta_{mk})\n$$\nIn this sum, all terms are zero except for the one where $m=k$. If $k  n$, all terms are zero. If $k \\le n$, the only non-zero term is for $m=k$:\n$$\nP^{(k)}(0) = a_k \\cdot (k!)\n$$\nSince $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the coefficient $a_k$ is an integer. For any non-negative integer $k$ (specifically for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$), the factorial $k!$ is also an integer. The product of two integers, $a_k \\cdot k!$, is an integer. Therefore, we have verified that $P^{(k)}(0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Calculation for a Specific Polynomial\nWe are given the polynomial:\n$$\nP(x) = 17x^{6} - 29x^{5} + 13x^{4} - 31x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 47x + 101\n$$\nThis is a polynomial of degree $n=6$. The coefficients are:\n$a_6=17$, $a_5=-29$, $a_4=13$, $a_3=-31$, $a_2=2$, $a_1=-47$, $a_0=101$.\n\nWe need to compute the sum:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\frac{P^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\n$$\nUsing the result from Part 1, $P^{(k)}(0) = a_k k!$, we can substitute this into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\frac{a_k k!}{k!} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} a_k\n$$\nThe sum $S$ is simply the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)$.\n\nThe question asks why $S$ must be an integer. Since $P(x)$ is defined to be in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, each of its coefficients, $a_k$, is an integer. The sum of a finite number of integers is always an integer. Therefore, $S = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} a_k$ must be an integer. This aligns with the concept of an \"integrality lemma,\" which guarantees integer results from specific operations on such polynomials.\n\nAn alternative perspective is to recognize that the Maclaurin series expansion of a polynomial is the polynomial itself:\n$$\nP(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\frac{P^{(k)}(0)}{k!} x^k\n$$\nEvaluating this expression at $x=1$ gives:\n$$\nP(1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\frac{P^{(k)}(0)}{k!} (1)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\frac{P^{(k)}(0)}{k!} = S\n$$\nSo, the sum $S$ is equivalent to $P(1)$. Since $P(x)$ has integer coefficients, evaluating it at an integer argument (like $x=1$) must produce an integer result.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact value of $S$ by summing the coefficients:\n$$\nS = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6\n$$\n$$\nS = 101 + (-47) + 2 + (-31) + 13 + (-29) + 17\n$$\n$$\nS = 101 - 47 + 2 - 31 + 13 - 29 + 17\n$$\nGrouping the positive and negative terms:\n$$\nS = (101 + 2 + 13 + 17) - (47 + 31 + 29)\n$$\n$$\nS = 133 - 107\n$$\n$$\nS = 26\n$$\nThe value of the sum is $26$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{26}$$", "id": "3015778"}, {"introduction": "Building on the integrality property, the next step in Hermite's method is to construct a special \"auxiliary function\" that is demonstrably small yet tied to an integer expression.

The core of the construction is to find polynomials $A_n(x)$ and $B_n(x)$ with rational coefficients such that $A_n(x)\\exp(x) - B_n(x)$ is very small for $x$ near $0$.\nOur calculation is a specific instance of this construction. We have found polynomials $D(x)$ and $N(x)$ such that $D(x)\\exp(x) - N(x) = G(x)$, where $G(x)$ is a small error term. We have $D(x) = N(-x)$, a known property of diagonal Padé approximants for $\\exp(x)$.\nSetting $x=1$, we have $D(1)\\exp(1) - N(1) = G(1)$, or $N(-1)e - N(1) = G(1)$.\nSubstituting the values we found: $\\frac{7}{12}e - \\frac{19}{12} = G(1)$.\nThis can be rewritten as $7e - 19 = 12G(1)$.\nThe numbers $7$ and $19$ are integers. The left side is an integer combination of $e$ and $1$. The right side, $12G(1)$, is a non-zero, verifiably small quantity. Neglecting this small term gives the approximation $7e - 19 \\approx 0$, which yields $e \\approx 19/7$, our Padé approximant $R(1)$.\nHermite's proof for the transcendence of $e$ proceeds by assuming $e$ is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients: $c_m e^m + \\dots + c_1 e + c_0 = 0$. One constructs a small auxiliary function $\\epsilon(x)$ (related to our $G(x)$) and multiplies the polynomial equation by it. By integrating this expression and using relations of the form $D(k)e^k - N(k) \\approx 0$ (derived from Padé-like approximants at $x=k$), one can show that a certain quantity must be a non-zero integer. However, the construction also ensures this quantity is less than $1$ in absolute value, a contradiction. Our explicit computation of $R(x)$ and its error term provides a concrete example of the fundamental building block of Hermite's more general argument.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{19}{7}}$$", "id": "3015781"}]}
