The given exponents are $\\alpha_{1} = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\alpha_{2} = \\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha_{3} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe dimension of a vector space spanned by a set of vectors is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in that set. Therefore, our task is to determine if the numbers in the set $S$ are linearly independent over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$. If they are, the dimension will be the cardinality of the set, which is $3$. If they are not, the dimension will be smaller than $3$.\n\nA linear relation among the elements of $S$ with coefficients from $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ would be an equation of the form:\n$$\n\\beta_{1}\\exp(\\alpha_{1}) + \\beta_{2}\\exp(\\alpha_{2}) + \\beta_{3}\\exp(\\alpha_{3}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\beta_{3} \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ are not all zero. The problem asks for a framework to rule out such a nontrivial relation. This framework is provided by the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, a cornerstone of transcendence theory.\n\nThe Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem states:\nIf $\\gamma_{1}, \\gamma_{2}, \\dots, \\gamma_{n}$ are distinct algebraic numbers, then the complex numbers $\\exp(\\gamma_{1}), \\exp(\\gamma_{2}), \\dots, \\exp(\\gamma_{n})$ are linearly independent over the field of algebraic numbers $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\nTo apply this theorem to our problem, we must verify that its hypotheses are satisfied for the exponents $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3}$. The two conditions to check are:\n$1$. The numbers $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3}$ must be algebraic numbers.\n$2$. The numbers $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3}$ must be distinct.\n\nLet's verify the first condition. An algebraic number is a root of a non-zero polynomial with rational (or, equivalently, integer) coefficients.\n- For $\\alpha_{1} = \\sqrt{2}$: Let $x = \\sqrt{2}$. Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 2$, or $x^2 - 2 = 0$. Thus, $\\alpha_{1}$ is a root of the polynomial $P_{1}(x) = x^2 - 2$, so it is an algebraic number.\n- For $\\alpha_{2} = \\sqrt{3}$: Let $x = \\sqrt{3}$. Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 3$, or $x^2 - 3 = 0$. Thus, $\\alpha_{2}$ is a root of the polynomial $P_{2}(x) = x^2 - 3$, so it is an algebraic number.\n- For $\\alpha_{3} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$: Let $x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. Then $x - \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{3}$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = 3$, which expands to $x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 2 = 3$. Rearranging gives $x^2 - 1 = 2\\sqrt{2}x$. Squaring both sides again yields $(x^2 - 1)^2 = (2\\sqrt{2}x)^2$, which is $x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot x^2 = 8x^2$. This simplifies to $x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0$. Thus, $\\alpha_{3}$ is a root of the polynomial $P_{3}(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$, confirming it is an algebraic number.\n\nAll three exponents are indeed algebraic numbers, and they all belong to the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ as stated in the problem.\n\nNext, let's verify the second condition: that the exponents are distinct.\n- $\\alpha_{1} = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\alpha_{2} = \\sqrt{3}$. Since $2 \\neq 3$, their square roots are not equal. So, $\\alpha_{1} \\neq \\alpha_{2}$.\n- To compare $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{3}$, we check if $\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. This would imply $\\sqrt{3} = 0$, which is false. So, $\\alpha_{1} \\neq \\alpha_{3}$.\n- To compare $\\alpha_{2}$ and $\\alpha_{3}$, we check if $\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. This would imply $\\sqrt{2} = 0$, which is false. So, $\\alpha_{2} \\neq \\alpha_{3}$.\n\nThe three exponents $\\alpha_{1}$, $\\alpha_{2}$, and $\\alpha_{3}$ are distinct algebraic numbers.\n\nSince both conditions of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem are satisfied, we can apply its conclusion directly. The numbers $\\exp(\\alpha_{1})$, $\\exp(\\alpha_{2})$, and $\\exp(\\alpha_{3})$ are linearly independent over the field of algebraic numbers $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\nThis means that the only solution to the equation $\\beta_{1}\\exp(\\alpha_{1}) + \\beta_{2}\\exp(\\alpha_{2}) + \\beta_{3}\\exp(\\alpha_{3}) = 0$ with $\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\beta_{3} \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the trivial solution $\\beta_{1} = \\beta_{2} = \\beta_{3} = 0$.\n\nThe vector space in question is spanned by the set $S = \\{\\exp(\\alpha_{1}), \\exp(\\alpha_{2}), \\exp(\\alpha_{3})\\}$. We have just shown that this set is linearly independent over the field of scalars $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$. By definition, a spanning set that is also linearly independent is a basis for the vector space. The dimension of a vector space is the number of elements in any of its bases. The set $S$ has $3$ elements.\n\nTherefore, the dimension $d$ of the $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$-vector space spanned by $\\{\\exp(\\alpha_{1}), \\exp(\\alpha_{2}), \\exp(\\alpha_{3})\\}$ is $3$.\n\nIt is important to note that the exponents $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3}$ are themselves linearly dependent over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, since $\\alpha_{3} = \\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2}$, which can be written as $1 \\cdot \\alpha_{1} + 1 \\cdot \\alpha_{2} - 1 \\cdot \\alpha_{3} = 0$.

A field extension $K/F$ is a pair of fields $F \\subseteq K$. A set of elements $S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n\\} \\subset K$ is said to be algebraically independent over $F$ if for any non-zero polynomial $P(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)$ with coefficients in $F$, we have $P(s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n) \\neq 0$.

The transcendence degree of $K$ over $F$, denoted $\\text{tr.deg}_F(K)$, is the cardinality of any transcendence basis of $K$ over $F$. For the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(e, e^{\\sqrt{2}})/\\mathbb{Q}$, the elements $e$ and $e^{\\sqrt{2}}$ are its generators over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The transcendence degree is the number of algebraically independent generators.\n\nThe problem requires the use of the Lindemannâ€“Weierstrass theorem. We state the general form of this theorem:\n\n**Lindemannâ€“Weierstrass Theorem:** If $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_n$ are distinct algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, then their exponentials $e^{\\alpha_1}, e^{\\alpha_2}, \\dots, e^{\\alpha_n}$ are algebraically independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTo apply this theorem to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(e, e^{\\sqrt{2}})$, we must examine the exponents of $e$ that generate the field. The generators are $e = e^1$ and $e^{\\sqrt{2}}$. Let us identify the exponents as $\\alpha_1 = 1$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe now verify that these exponents satisfy the hypotheses of the Lindemannâ€“Weierstrass theorem.\n\n1.  **The exponents must be algebraic numbers.**\n    The number $\\alpha_1 = 1$ is an integer, and thus a rational number. It is the root of the polynomial $x - 1 = 0$, so it is an algebraic number.\n    The number $\\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{2}$ is the root of the polynomial $x^2 - 2 = 0$. Since the coefficients of this polynomial are rational, $\\sqrt{2}$ is an algebraic number.\n    The problem statement correctly identifies $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ as algebraic.\n\n2.  **The exponents must be linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\n    We need to show that the set $\\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\} = \\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$. To do so, we consider a linear combination of these numbers with rational coefficients and set it to zero:\n    $$c_1 \\alpha_1 + c_2 \\alpha_2 = 0$$\n    where $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.

Then we can write:\n    $$\\sqrt{2} = -\\frac{c_1}{c_2}$$\n    Since $c_1$ and $c_2$ are rational numbers, their ratio $-c_1/c_2$ is also a rational number. This would imply that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational, which is a known contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that $c_2 \\neq 0$ must be false. It follows that $c_2 = 0$.\n    Substituting $c_2 = 0$ back into the equation $c_1 + c_2 \\sqrt{2} = 0$, we get $c_1 = 0$.\n    Thus, the only solution in rational numbers is $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 0$.
