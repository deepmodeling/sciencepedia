The set $E_q \\subset [0,1]$ is defined as\n$$\nE_q = \\bigcup_{a=0}^{q} I'_a, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad I'_a = \\left( \\left[ \\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q},\\, \\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right] \\cap [0,1] \\right).\n$$\nHere, $m(\\cdot)$ denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n\nFirst, we derive the specified upper bound for $m(E_q)$. The set $E_q$ is a finite union of measurable sets $I'_a$. By the property of subadditivity of the Lebesgue measure, the measure of a union of sets is less than or equal to the sum of the measures of the individual sets.\n$$\nm(E_q) = m\\left(\\bigcup_{a=0}^{q} I'_a\\right) \\le \\sum_{a=0}^{q} m(I'_a).\n$$\nFor each $a \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, q\\}$, the set $I'_a$ is contained within the interval $I_a = \\left[ \\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q},\\, \\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right]$. The length, or Lebesgue measure, of $I_a$ is\n$$\nm(I_a) = \\left(\\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}.\n$$\nSince $I'_a \\subseteq I_a$, we have $m(I'_a) \\le m(I_a) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}$. The summation has $q+1$ terms, corresponding to $a=0, 1, \\dots, q$. Summing these upper bounds gives:\n$$\nm(E_q) \\le \\sum_{a=0}^{q} \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q} = (q+1) \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}.\n$$\nThis establishes the first inequality. To establish the second, we analyze the factor multiplying $\\psi(q)$:\n$$\n(q+1) \\frac{2}{q} = 2 \\frac{q+1}{q} = 2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{q}\\right).\n$$\nSince $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $q \\ge 1$, which implies $0 < \\frac{1}{q} \\le 1$. Therefore, $1 < 1 + \\frac{1}{q} \\le 2$. This leads to:\n$$\n2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{q}\\right) \\psi(q) \\le 2(2) \\psi(q) = 4\\psi(q).\n$$\nCombining these results, we have shown from first principles that\n$$\nm(E_q) \\le 2(q+1)\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\le 4\\psi(q).\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the sharpness of this bound by computing $m(E_q)$ exactly under the specific condition $0 < \\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. We must first determine if the intervals constituting $E_q$ are disjoint under this condition. Let us consider the full intervals $I_a = \\left[ \\frac{a}{q} - \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q},\\, \\frac{a}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right]$. The centers of two adjacent intervals, $I_a$ and $I_{a+1}$, are $\\frac{a}{q}$ and $\\frac{a+1}{q}$. The distance between these centers is $\\frac{1}{q}$. The radius of each interval is $r = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}$. For these two intervals to be disjoint, the distance between their centers must be at least the sum of their radii, which is $2r = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}$.\nThe condition for disjointness (or touching at endpoints) is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{q} \\ge \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q} \\iff 1 \\ge 2\\psi(q) \\iff \\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThis is precisely the assumption given. Therefore, under the condition $\\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, the intervals $I_a$ for $a \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, q\\}$ are pairwise disjoint. Since $I'_a \\subset I_a$, the sets $I'_a$ are also pairwise disjoint.\nThis disjointness implies that the measure of the union is the sum of the measures:\n$$\nm(E_q) = m\\left(\\bigcup_{a=0}^{q} I'_a\\right) = \\sum_{a=0}^{q} m(I'_a).\n$$\nWe now compute the measure of each $I'_a$:\n1.  For $a=0$: $I'_0 = \\left[ -\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}, \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right] \\cap [0,1] = \\left[0, \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right]$. Thus, $m(I'_0) = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}$.\n2.  For $a=q$: $I'_q = \\left[ 1-\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}, 1+\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} \\right] \\cap [0,1] = \\left[1-\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}, 1\\right]$. Thus, $m(I'_q) = 1 - \\left(1-\\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}\\right) = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q}$.\n3.  For $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, q-1\\}$: The interval is $I_a = \\left[ \\frac{a-\\psi(q)}{q}, \\frac{a+\\psi(q)}{q} \\right]$. We verify if it lies entirely within $[0,1]$.\n    The left endpoint is $\\frac{a-\\psi(q)}{q}$. Since $a \\ge 1$ and $\\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $a-\\psi(q) \\ge 1-\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} > 0$.\n    The right endpoint is $\\frac{a+\\psi(q)}{q}$. Since $a \\le q-1$ and $\\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $a+\\psi(q) \\le (q-1)+\\frac{1}{2} = q-\\frac{1}{2} < q$.\n    Thus, for $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, q-1\\}$, the interval $I_a$ is fully contained in $(0,1)$, meaning $I'_a = I_a$. The measure is $m(I'_a) = m(I_a) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}$.\n\nSumming these measures:\nIf $q=1$, the indices are $a=0,1$. $m(E_1) = m(I'_0) + m(I'_1) = \\frac{\\psi(1)}{1} + \\frac{\\psi(1)}{1} = 2\\psi(1)$.\nIf $q \\ge 2$, there are $q-1$ interior intervals.\n$$\nm(E_q) = m(I'_0) + m(I'_q) + \\sum_{a=1}^{q-1} m(I'_a) = \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} + \\frac{\\psi(q)}{q} + (q-1) \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q}\n$$\n$$\nm(E_q) = \\frac{2\\psi(q)}{q} + \\frac{(2q-2)\\psi(q)}{q} = \\frac{(2 + 2q - 2)\\psi(q)}{q} = \\frac{2q\\psi(q)}{q} = 2\\psi(q).\n$$\nThe formula $m(E_q) = 2\\psi(q)$ holds for $q=1$ as well. Thus, for any $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any function $\\psi$ such that $0 < \\psi(q) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, the exact measure is $m(E_q)=2\\psi(q)$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to find the smallest constant $C > 0$ such that the uniform inequality $m(E_q) \\le C\\psi(q)$ holds for all $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and all $\\psi(q) \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\nFrom our exact computation, we have $m(E_q) = 2\\psi(q)$ for all parameters in the specified range. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n2\\psi(q) \\le C\\psi(q).\n$$\nSince $\\psi(q) > 0$, we can divide by it without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$\n2 \\le C.\n$$\nThe condition must hold for any choice of $q$ and $\\psi(q)$ in the given domain. Since we found that the ratio $\\frac{m(E_q)}{\\psi(q)}$ is always equal to $2$, the supremum of this ratio over the domain is $2$.\nFor the inequality $\\frac{m(E_q)}{\\psi(q)} \\le C$ to hold universally, $C$ must be greater than or equal to this supremum.
