This is a rational number. Its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $X - 2 = 0$. This polynomial has integer coefficients, a positive leading coefficient, and the greatest common divisor of its coefficients is $\\gcd(-2, 1) = 1$. Thus, the minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(X) = 1 \\cdot X - 2$.\nFrom this, we identify the parameters:\n- Degree: $d = 1$.\n- Leading coefficient: $a_{1} = 1$.\n- The only root is $\\alpha_{1} = 2$.\n\nNow, we apply the height formula:\n$$\nh(2) = \\frac{1}{1} \\left( \\ln a_{1} + \\sum_{i=1}^{1} \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |\\alpha_{i}| \\} \\right)\n= \\ln(1) + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |2| \\}\n= 0 + \\ln(2)\n= \\ln(2).\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $h(\\sqrt{2})$**\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$. Squaring both sides gives $\\alpha^2 = 2$, so $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $X^2 - 2 = 0$. This polynomial is monic, has integer coefficients, and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Its coefficients have a gcd of $\\gcd(-2, 0, 1) = 1$. Thus, $P(X) = X^2 - 2$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe parameters are:\n- Degree: $d = 2$.\n- Leading coefficient: $a_{2} = 1$.\n- The roots are the conjugates $\\alpha_{1} = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\alpha_{2} = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nApplying the height formula:\n$$\nh(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\ln a_{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |\\alpha_{i}| \\} \\right)\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\ln(1) + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |\\sqrt{2}| \\} + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |-\\sqrt{2}| \\} \\right)\n$$\nSince $|\\sqrt{2}| = |-\\sqrt{2}| = \\sqrt{2} > 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nh(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} ( 0 + \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) + \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) )\n= \\frac{1}{2} ( 2 \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) )\n= \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) = \\ln(2^{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2).\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $h(\\frac{1}{3})$**\nLet $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{3}$. This is a rational number. The equation is $3\\alpha = 1$, which corresponds to the polynomial $3X - 1 = 0$. This polynomial has integer coefficients, is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as it is linear), has a positive leading coefficient $a_1=3$, and its coefficients have a gcd of $\\gcd(-1, 3) = 1$. Thus, $P(X) = 3X - 1$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\frac{1}{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe parameters are:\n- Degree: $d = 1$.\n- Leading coefficient: $a_{1} = 3$.\n- The only root is $\\alpha_{1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nApplying the height formula:\n$$\nh\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1} \\left( \\ln a_{1} + \\sum_{i=1}^{1} \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |\\alpha_{i}| \\} \\right)\n= \\ln(3) + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |\\frac{1}{3}| \\}\n$$\nSince $|\\frac{1}{3}| < 1$, $\\max\\{1, |\\frac{1}{3}|\\} = 1$.\n$$\nh\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\ln(3) + \\ln(1) = \\ln(3).\n$$\n\n**Part 4: Verification of Height Inequalities**\nWe are asked to verify two inequalities for $\\alpha = 2$ and $\\beta = \\sqrt{2}$.\nWe have $h(\\alpha) = h(2) = \\ln(2)$ and $h(\\beta) = h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2)$.\nThe right-hand sides of the inequalities are:\n- $h(\\alpha) + h(\\beta) = \\ln(2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2)$.\n- $h(\\alpha) + h(\\beta) + \\ln 2 = \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2) + \\ln(2) = \\frac{5}{2}\\ln(2)$.\n\n**Verification of $h(\\alpha \\beta) \\leq h(\\alpha) + h(\\beta)$**\nLet $\\gamma = \\alpha \\beta = 2\\sqrt{2}$. We compute $h(\\gamma)$.\n$\\gamma^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$, so $\\gamma$ is a root of $X^2 - 8 = 0$. This polynomial is monic, has integer coefficients, and is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ because $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. The gcd of its coefficients is $\\gcd(-8, 0, 1) = 1$. Thus, $P(X) = X^2 - 8$ is the minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n- Degree: $d = 2$.\n- Leading coefficient: $a_2 = 1$.\n- Roots: $\\gamma_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}$, $\\gamma_2 = -2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe height is:\n$$\nh(2\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} ( \\ln(1) + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |2\\sqrt{2}| \\} + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |-2\\sqrt{2}| \\} )\n$$\n$$\nh(2\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} ( 0 + \\ln(2\\sqrt{2}) + \\ln(2\\sqrt{2}) ) = \\ln(2\\sqrt{2}) = \\ln(2^{3/2}) = \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2).\n$$\nWe must check if $h(2\\sqrt{2}) \\leq h(2) + h(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe left-hand side is $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2)$, and the right-hand side is $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2)$. The inequality holds as an equality: $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2) \\leq \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2)$.\n\n**Verification of $h(\\alpha + \\beta) \\leq h(\\alpha) + h(\\beta) + \\ln 2$**\nLet $\\delta = \\alpha + \\beta = 2 + \\sqrt{2}$. We compute $h(\\delta)$.\nWe have $\\delta - 2 = \\sqrt{2}$, and squaring both sides gives $(\\delta - 2)^2 = 2$, which expands to $\\delta^2 - 4\\delta + 4 = 2$, or $\\delta^2 - 4\\delta + 2 = 0$.\nThe polynomial $P(X) = X^2 - 4X + 2$ is monic, has integer coefficients with $\\gcd(2, -4, 1) = 1$. Its roots are $X = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-8}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational. Thus, $P(X)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and is the minimal polynomial of $2+\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n- Degree: $d = 2$.\n- Leading coefficient: $a_2 = 1$.\n- Roots: $\\delta_1 = 2+\\sqrt{2}$, $\\delta_2 = 2-\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe height is:\n$$\nh(2+\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} ( \\ln(1) + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |2+\\sqrt{2}| \\} + \\ln \\max \\{ 1, |2-\\sqrt{2}| \\} )\n$$\nWe have $|2+\\sqrt{2}| = 2+\\sqrt{2} \\approx 3.414 > 1$. And $|2-\\sqrt{2}| = 2-\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.586 < 1$.\nSo, $\\max\\{1, |2+\\sqrt{2}|\\} = 2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\max\\{1, |2-\\sqrt{2}|\\} = 1$.\n$$\nh(2+\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} ( 0 + \\ln(2+\\sqrt{2}) + \\ln(1) ) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2+\\sqrt{2}).\n$$\nWe must check if $h(2+\\sqrt{2}) \\leq h(2) + h(\\sqrt{2}) + \\ln 2$.\nThe left-hand side is $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2+\\sqrt{2})$ and the right-hand side is $\\frac{5}{2}\\ln(2)$.\nThe inequality is $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2+\\sqrt{2}) \\leq \\frac{5}{2}\\ln(2)$, which is equivalent to $\\ln(2+\\sqrt{2}) \\leq 5\\ln(2) = \\ln(2^5) = \\ln(32)$.\nSince the natural logarithm function is strictly increasing, this is equivalent to $2+\\sqrt{2} \\leq 32$, or $\\sqrt{2} \\leq 30$. This is clearly true, as $2 < 900$. The inequality is verified.\n\nThe problem asks for the tuple of the first three computed heights.\nThe results are $h(2) = \\ln(2)$, $h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$, and $h(\\frac{1}{3}) = \\ln(3)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\ln(2) & \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) & \\ln(3)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3029861"}, {"introduction": "The discovery of transcendental numbers was first achieved by constructing numbers that are \"too well\" approximated by rationals, a property that algebraic numbers cannot possess.

The concepts of continued fractions, convergents, Liouville numbers, and the irrationality exponent are all standard and well-established mathematical topics. The given inequality is a fundamental theorem concerning the accuracy of continued fraction approximations.\n- **Well-Posed**: The number $x$ is defined constructively. We can compute the first few terms: $a_1=1 \\implies q_1 = a_1 q_0 + q_{-1} = 1(1)+0=1$. Then $a_2 = q_1^1 = 1^1 = 1 \\implies q_2 = a_2 q_1 + q_0 = 1(1)+1=2$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we prove that $x$ is a Liouville number. A real number $x$ is a Liouville number if for every positive integer $m$, the inequality $\\left|x - \\frac{p}{q}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q^m}$ has infinitely many rational solutions $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $q > 1$.\n\nWe will use the sequence of convergents $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ of $x$ as our rational approximations. Since $a_n$ are positive integers for all $n \\ge 1$, the denominators $q_n$ form a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers for $n \\ge 1$ ($q_1=1, q_2=2, q_3=9, \\dots$). Thus, the convergents form an infinite set of distinct rational numbers.\n\nFor any $n \\ge 1$, we are given the relation $a_{n+1} = q_n^n$. We substitute this into the fundamental inequality for continued fraction approximations, which is valid for $n \\ge 1$:\n$$\n\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right| < \\frac{1}{a_{n+1} q_n^2} = \\frac{1}{q_n^n \\cdot q_n^2} = \\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}}\n$$\nNow, let $m \\ge 1$ be an arbitrary integer. We want to show that there are infinitely many $n$ for which $\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q_n^m}$.\nFrom the inequality derived above, this condition is satisfied if:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}} < \\frac{1}{q_n^m}\n$$\nSince $q_n \\ge 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$, this is equivalent to $q_n^{n+2} > q_n^m$, which simplifies to $n+2 > m$, or $n > m-2$.\n\nFor any fixed integer $m$, the condition $n > m-2$ is satisfied for an infinite number of integers $n$. Let's ensure our indices are valid, so we must also have $n \\ge 1$. The condition becomes $n \\ge \\max(1, m-1)$. For every integer $n$ in this infinite set, the corresponding convergent $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ satisfies:\n$$\n\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}} \\le \\frac{1}{q_n^m}\n$$\nThis establishes that for any integer $m \\ge 1$, there exists an infinite sequence of distinct rational numbers (the convergents $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ for $n \\ge \\max(1, m-1)$) satisfying the required inequality. Therefore, $x$ is a Liouville number.\n\nSecond, we compute the irrationality exponent $\\mu(x)$, which is defined as:\n$$\n\\mu(x) := \\sup\\left\\{\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\left|x - \\frac{p}{q}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q^{\\,\\mu}} \\text{ for infinitely many } \\frac{p}{q} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\right\\}\n$$\nLet $S$ be the set of real numbers $\\mu$ for which the inequality has infinitely many solutions. We want to find $\\sup S$.\nLet $\\mu_0$ be an arbitrary real number. We test whether $\\mu_0 \\in S$. We again use the convergents $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ as our candidate solutions for $\\frac{p}{q}$.\nAs shown before, for $n \\ge 1$, we have the inequality:\n$$\n\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}}\n$$\nFor the convergent $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ to be a solution for the exponent $\\mu_0$, it must satisfy $\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q_n^{\\mu_0}}$.\nThis is guaranteed if $\\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}} \\le \\frac{1}{q_n^{\\mu_0}}$. As $q_n > 1$ for $n \\ge 2$, this is equivalent to $n+2 \\ge \\mu_0$, or $n \\ge \\mu_0 - 2$.\n\nFor any given real number $\\mu_0$, the set of integers $n$ satisfying $n \\ge \\max(2, \\mu_0 - 2)$ is infinite. For each such $n$, the convergent $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ satisfies the inequality for the exponent $\\mu_0$. This means that for any real number $\\mu_0$, there are infinitely many rational approximations $\\frac{p}{q}$ such that $\\left|x-\\frac{p}{q}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q^{\\mu_0}}$.\n\nTherefore, the set $S$ contains every real number, i.e., $S = \\mathbb{R}$. The supremum of a set that is not bounded above is infinity.\n$$\n\\mu(x) = \\sup(\\mathbb{R}) = \\infty\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the fact that $x$ is a Liouville number, as the condition for being a Liouville number is equivalent to having an infinite irrationality exponent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\infty}$$", "id": "3029847"}, {"introduction": "While Liouville's criterion provides a beautiful entry point to transcendence proofs, many important numbers like $e$ and $\\pi$ require far more powerful machinery.

Such bounds are fundamental results in transcendental number theory, stemming from the work of Alan Baker. We will use a modern, explicit version of these results derived from a theorem by Andrej D. Matveev, as it is a standard and powerful tool for such problems.\n\nSpecifically, we will use the version presented by Bugeaud, Mignotte, and Siksek (Annals of Mathematics, 2006), which is well-suited for practical applications. For a linear form $\\Lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i \\log \\alpha_i$ with algebraic numbers $\\alpha_i$ and integers $b_i$, their theorem provides a lower bound on $|\\Lambda|$. We must specialize this theorem to the conditions of the problem: $n=2$ logarithms of rational numbers $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2$.\n\nFor rational numbers, the containing number field is $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the degree $D$ is $1$. The general theorem simplifies considerably under these conditions. The theorem states that if $\\Lambda \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\log |\\Lambda| > -C(n, D) \\cdot (1 + \\log B) \\cdot A_1 \\cdots A_n\n$$\nwhere the parameters $A_i$ relate to the heights of $\\alpha_i$, $B$ is a bound on the coefficients $|b_i|$, and $C(n, D)$ is a computable constant.\n\nFollowing the problem's specifications, we define the parameters as follows:\n- The number of logarithms is $n=2$.\n- The degree is $D=1$, as $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n- The coefficients are $b_1, b_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- The rational numbers are $\\alpha_1 = p_1/q_1$ and $\\alpha_2 = p_2/q_2$, given to be in lowest terms and positive.\n- The absolute logarithmic height of a rational $\\alpha = p/q$ is $h(\\alpha) = \\log \\max\\{|p|,|q|\\}$.\n- The quantities $A_i$ are defined as $A_i = \\max\\{h(\\alpha_i), |\\log \\alpha_i|, 0.1\\}$ for $i=1,2$.\n- The bound for the coefficients is $B = \\max\\{3, |b_1|, |b_2|\\}$.\n\nThe constant from the specialized Matveev theorem (for $D=1, n=2$) is $C_0 = 1.4 \\cdot 30^{n+3} \\cdot n^{4.5} \\cdot D^2 (1+\\log D)$. With $n=2$ and $D=1$, the term $(1+\\log D)$ becomes $(1+\\log 1) = 1$, and we have:\n$$\nC_0 = 1.4 \\cdot 30^{2+3} \\cdot 2^{4.5} = 1.4 \\cdot 30^5 \\cdot 2^{4.5} \\approx 7.704 \\times 10^8\n$$\nCombining these elements, the lower bound for a non-zero $\\Lambda$ is given by:\n$$\n|\\Lambda| > \\exp\\left( -C_0 \\cdot (1 + \\log B) \\cdot A_1 \\cdot A_2 \\right)\n$$\n\n### Degeneracy Condition\n\nThe above bound is valid only if $\\Lambda \\neq 0$. The case $\\Lambda = 0$ corresponds to the degeneracy condition $\\alpha_1^{b_1} \\alpha_2^{b_2} = 1$. This occurs if and only if $b_1 \\log \\alpha_1 + b_2 \\log \\alpha_2 = \\log(\\alpha_1^{b_1}\\alpha_2^{b_2}) = \\log(1) = 0$.\n\nTo check this condition without precision loss from floating-point arithmetic, we must use exact integer computations. Let $b_i = b_i^+ - b_i^-$ where $b_i^+ = \\max(b_i, 0)$ and $b_i^- = \\max(-b_i, 0)$ are non-negative integers. The condition $\\alpha_1^{b_1} \\alpha_2^{b_2} = 1$ is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{p_1}{q_1}\\right)^{b_1} \\left(\\frac{p_2}{q_2}\\right)^{b_2} = 1 \\iff p_1^{b_1^+} q_1^{b_1^-} p_2^{b_2^+} q_2^{b_2^-} = q_1^{b_1^+} p_1^{b_1^-} q_2^{b_2^+} p_2^{b_2^-}\n$$\nThis equality involves only integer powers of integers and can be verified exactly. If this identity holds, the lower bound for $|\\Lambda|$ is $0$.\n\n### Algorithmic Procedure\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in two main stages for each test case $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, b_1, b_2)$:\n\n1.  **Check for Degeneracy**:\n    - Given inputs $(p_1, q_1)$, $(p_2, q_2)$, $b_1$, and $b_2$.\n    - Compute the left-hand side and right-hand side of the integer identity derived above using arbitrary-precision integers.\n    - If they are equal, the linear form $\\Lambda$ is zero. The result is $0.0$.\n\n2.  **Compute the Lower Bound**:\n    - If the form is non-degenerate, calculate the required parameters for the bound:\n        a. $B = \\max\\{3, |b_1|, |b_2|\\}$.\n        b. For $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, compute $\\alpha_i = p_i/q_i$.\n        c. Compute the heights $h(\\alpha_1) = \\log(\\max\\{p_1, q_1\\})$ and $h(\\alpha_2) = \\log(\\max\\{p_2, q_2\\})$. Note that since $\\alpha_i > 0$ and are in lowest terms, $p_i$ and $q_i$ are positive.\n        d. Compute $A_1 = \\max\\{h(\\alpha_1), |\\log \\alpha_1|, 0.1\\}$ and $A_2 = \\max\\{h(\\alpha_2), |\\log \\alpha_2|, 0.1\\}$.\n        e. The constant is $C_0 = 1.4 \\cdot 30^5 \\cdot 2^{4.5}$.\n        f. The final numerical lower bound is calculated as $\\exp(-C_0 \\cdot (1 + \\log B) \\cdot A_1 \\cdot A_2)$.\n\nThis procedure provides a rigorous and explicit lower bound for $|\\Lambda|$, adhering to the provided definitions and leveraging a standard result from transcendental number theory.
