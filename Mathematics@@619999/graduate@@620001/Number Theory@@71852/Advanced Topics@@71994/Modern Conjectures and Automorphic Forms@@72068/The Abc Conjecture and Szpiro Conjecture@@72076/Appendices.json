The product is $abc = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30$.\nThe radical of a nonzero integer $n$, denoted $\\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of the distinct prime numbers that divide $n$. The prime factorization of $30$ is $2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$. The distinct prime factors are $2$, $3$, and $5$.\nTherefore, the radical is:\n$$ \\operatorname{rad}(abc) = \\operatorname{rad}(30) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30 $$\n\nSecond, we compute the quality, $q(a,b,c)$.\nThe quality of a coprime triple $(a,b,c)$ with $a+b=c$ is defined as:\n$$ q(a,b,c) = \\frac{\\ln c}{\\ln \\operatorname{rad}(abc)} $$\nSubstituting the values $c=5$ and $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)=30$ from our specific triple:\n$$ q(2,3,5) = \\frac{\\ln 5}{\\ln 30} $$\nThis is the exact symbolic expression for the quality.\n\nThird, we assess whether this computed quality is typical in the context of the abc conjecture.\nThe abc conjecture states that for any real number $\\epsilon > 0$, there are only finitely many coprime triples $(a,b,c)$ with $a+b=c$ that satisfy the inequality $c > (\\operatorname{rad}(abc))^{1+\\epsilon}$.\nTo understand this in terms of quality, we can manipulate the inequality. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides (a strictly increasing function, which preserves the inequality):\n$$ \\ln c > \\ln\\left( (\\operatorname{rad}(abc))^{1+\\epsilon} \\right) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln x$:\n$$ \\ln c > (1+\\epsilon) \\ln(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)) $$\nFor any non-trivial triple, $a,b,c$ are positive integers, so $\\operatorname{rad}(abc) \\ge \\operatorname{rad}(1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3) = 6 > 1$, which implies $\\ln(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)) > 0$. We can thus divide by $\\ln(\\operatorname{rad}(abc))$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln c}{\\ln(\\operatorname{rad}(abc))} > 1+\\epsilon $$\nThe left-hand side is the definition of the quality, $q(a,b,c)$. The abc conjecture is therefore equivalent to the statement that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, only a finite number of triples have a quality $q(a,b,c) > 1+\\epsilon$. This implies that almost all triples are expected to have a quality $q(a,b,c) \\le 1$. Triples with $q > 1$ are considered high-quality and are the rare exceptions that the conjecture addresses. The conjecture is often stated as $\\limsup q(a,b,c) = 1$.\n\nFor our triple $(2,3,5)$, the quality is $q(2,3,5) = \\frac{\\ln 5}{\\ln 30}$.\nSince $5 < 30$, and the natural logarithm function $\\ln(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x > 0$, it follows that $\\ln 5 < \\ln 30$.\nTherefore, the quality is:\n$$ q(2,3,5) = \\frac{\\ln 5}{\\ln 30} < 1 $$\nA quality less than $1$ is entirely ordinary and does not fall into the category of exceptional triples that the abc conjecture describes. The conjecture is concerned with the rarity of triples where $c$ is \"surprisingly large\" compared to the product of the primes dividing $a,b,c$. In our case, $c=5$ is significantly smaller than $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)=30$, leading to a low quality. In fact, because $a,b,c$ are themselves prime numbers, the product $abc$ is square-free, meaning $\\operatorname{rad}(abc) = abc$. This leads to a particularly small quality value relative to many other triples.\nThe reference to Szpiro's conjecture, which is equivalent to the abc conjecture, provides a geometric viewpoint. A high-quality abc-triple gives rise to a Frey elliptic curve whose discriminant is unusually large compared to its conductor. The triple $(2,3,5)$ would correspond to an elliptic curve that is unremarkable from the perspective of the Szpiro inequality.\nIn conclusion, the computed quality $q(2,3,5)$ is less than $1$ and is therefore considered typical and unexceptional.

The integers are positive, coprime ($\\gcd(1,8,9)=1$), and satisfy $a+b=c$ since $1+8=9$.\nThe product $abc$ is $1 \\times 8 \\times 9 = 72$.\n\nThe radical of an integer $n$, denoted $\\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of its distinct prime factors. To find $\\operatorname{rad}(72)$, we first find the prime factorization of $72$.\n$$72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2$$\nThe distinct prime factors of $72$ are $2$ and $3$.\nTherefore, the radical is the product of these distinct primes:\n$$\\operatorname{rad}(abc) = \\operatorname{rad}(72) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$$\n\n2.  **Computation of $q(a,b,c)$**\n\nThe quality of an $abc$-triple is defined as $q(a,b,c) = \\frac{\\ln c}{\\ln \\operatorname{rad}(abc)}$.\nFor our triple, we have $c=9$ and from the previous step, $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)=6$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for quality gives:\n$$q(1,8,9) = \\frac{\\ln 9}{\\ln 6}$$\nTo express this in a more detailed symbolic form using properties of logarithms, we can write $\\ln 9 = \\ln(3^2) = 2 \\ln 3$ and $\\ln 6 = \\ln(2 \\times 3) = \\ln 2 + \\ln 3$.\nSo, the exact symbolic form of the quality is:\n$$q(1,8,9) = \\frac{2 \\ln 3}{\\ln 2 + \\ln 3}$$\nNumerically, this value is approximately $1.226$, which is greater than $1$. Triples with quality greater than $1$ are of particular interest in the study of the $abc$ conjecture.\n\n3.  **Explanation of the effect of $c$ being a perfect square**\n\nThe $abc$ conjecture posits that for any real number $\\varepsilon > 0$, there are only finitely many $abc$-triples for which $c > (\\operatorname{rad}(abc))^{1+\\varepsilon}$. This is equivalent to saying that the quality $q(a,b,c) = \\frac{\\ln c}{\\ln \\operatorname{rad}(abc)}$ exceeds $1+\\varepsilon$ for only a finite number of triples. The conjecture implies that the radical $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)$ is typically not much smaller than $c$.\n\nThe size of $\\operatorname{rad}(n)$ relative to $n$ is small precisely when $n$ is a \"powerful\" number, i.e., when its prime factorization contains high powers of primes. The fact that $c$ is a perfect square is a specific instance of this.\nIf an integer $c$ is a perfect square, say $c=k^2$ for some integer $k>1$, then its prime factorization consists of primes raised to even powers. The radical, $\\operatorname{rad}(c)$, only accounts for the distinct prime factors, so $\\operatorname{rad}(c) = \\operatorname{rad}(k)$. Since $\\operatorname{rad}(k) \\le k$, we have $\\operatorname{rad}(c) \\le \\sqrt{c}$. For our triple, $c=9=3^2$, so $\\operatorname{rad}(c)=\\operatorname{rad}(9)=3$, and indeed $\\operatorname{rad}(9) = \\sqrt{9}$.\nIn general, if an integer $n$ is a perfect $m$-th power, $n=k^m$, then $\\operatorname{rad}(n) = \\operatorname{rad}(k) \\le k = n^{1/m}$. This shows that a number being a perfect power significantly reduces the size of its radical relative to the number itself.\n\nIn an $abc$-triple, since $a,b,c$ are pairwise coprime, $\\operatorname{rad}(abc) = \\operatorname{rad}(a)\\operatorname{rad}(b)\\operatorname{rad}(c)$. When one of the components, such as $c$, is a perfect power, its contribution to the radical, $\\operatorname{rad}(c)$, is small relative to its contribution to the sum (since $c=a+b$). This tends to make the overall radical $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)$ small in comparison to $c$. For our triple, $a=1$, $b=8=2^3$, and $c=9=3^2$. Both $b$ and $c$ are perfect powers, making $\\operatorname{rad}(b)=2$ (much smaller than $8$) and $\\operatorname{rad}(c)=3$ (smaller than $9$). This results in a small total radical $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)=6$ compared to $c=9$, leading to a high quality $q(1,8,9) > 1$. Triples containing perfect powers are the primary source of high-quality examples that test the limits of the $abc$ conjecture.\n\nThe connection to Szpiro's conjecture arises from the study of elliptic curves. For any $abc$-triple, one can construct a corresponding Frey-Hellegouarch elliptic curve, for instance $y^2 = x(x-a)(x+b)$. A version of Szpiro's conjecture relates the minimal discriminant $\\Delta$ and the conductor $N$ of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by the inequality $|\\Delta| \\le C(\\varepsilon) N^{6+\\varepsilon}$ for any $\\varepsilon > 0$. For the Frey curve associated with an $abc$-triple, the conductor $N$ is essentially $\\operatorname{rad}(abc)$ and the discriminant $\\Delta$ is proportional to $(abc)^2$. An $abc$-triple where one term is a high power (like $c$ being a perfect square) leads to a Frey curve where the conductor $N$ is unusually small relative to the discriminant $|\\Delta|$. Such a curve is an \"extreme\" case in the context of Szpiro's conjecture, just as the corresponding $abc$-triple is an \"extreme\" case for the $abc$ conjecture.

The exponent $f_p$ is non-zero only for primes of bad reduction.

For all odd primes $p \\ge 3$, the curve has good reduction, and thus the conductor exponent is $f_p=0$.\n\nWe now determine the conductor exponent $f_2$ at the prime $p=2$ by analyzing the reduction type using Tate's algorithm.\n\n**Analysis at odd primes $p \\ge 3$:**\nFor any odd prime $p$, we have $v_p(\\Delta_E) = v_p(64) = 0$. A zero valuation of the minimal discriminant at a prime implies that the curve has good reduction (Kodaira type I$_0$) at that prime. For good reduction, the conductor exponent is $f_p=0$.
