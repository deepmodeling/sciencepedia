The problem states that we are at the central point $s = \\frac{1}{2}$, corresponding to $t=0$.

Their tensor product is also unramified, so the local conductor exponent is $a_p(f \\otimes \\chi_d) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Case $p | N$**: Since $f$ is a newform of squarefree level $N$, the representation $\\pi_f$ is ramified at $p$, and its local conductor exponent is $a_p(f) = 1$. The problem states $(d,N)=1$, so $p \\nmid d$, which means the character $\\chi_d$ is unramified at $p$. Twisting a representation by an unramified character does not change its conductor. Thus, $a_p(f \\otimes \\chi_d) = a_p(f) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Case $p | d$**: The problem states $(d,N)=1$, so $p \\nmid N$. This means the representation $\\pi_f$ is unramified at $p$. The character $\\chi_d$ is ramified at $p$ since $p$ divides its conductor $\\lvert d \\rvert$. For a GL($n$) representation that is unramified at $p$, its twist by a character $\\chi$ ramified at $p$ has a local conductor equal to the $n$-th power of the local conductor of $\\chi$. Here, $n=2$. The local conductor of $\\pi_f \\otimes \\chi_d$ at $p$ is $p^{a_p(f \\otimes \\chi_d)} = (p^{a_p(\\chi_d)})^{2}$. Therefore, the local exponent is $a_p(f \\otimes \\chi_d) = 2a_p(\\chi_d)$.\n\nCombining these results, the arithmetic conductor is:\n$$\nq(f \\otimes \\chi_d) = \\left( \\prod_{p | N} p^{a_p(f \\otimes \\chi_d)} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{p | d} p^{a_p(f \\otimes \\chi_d)} \\right) = \\left( \\prod_{p | N} p^1 \\right) \\left( \\prod_{p | d} p^{2a_p(\\chi_d)} \\right).\n$$\nThe first product is simply the level $N$. The second product can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\prod_{p | d} (p^{a_p(\\chi_d)})^2 = \\left( \\prod_{p | d} p^{a_p(\\chi_d)} \\right)^2.\n$$\nThe term inside the parentheses is the product of all local conductors of $\\chi_d$ at primes dividing $d$. Since $\\chi_d$ is unramified at primes not dividing its conductor $\\lvert d \\rvert$, this product is precisely the full conductor of the character, which is $\\lvert d \\rvert$.\nThus, we have:\n$$\nq(f \\otimes \\chi_d) = N \\cdot \\lvert d \\rvert^2.\n$$\nThe problem asks for the leading-order dependence on $D$ across the family where $\\lvert d \\rvert \\le D$. The conductor grows with $\\lvert d \\rvert$, reaching its maximum scale when $\\lvert d \\rvert$ is of order $D$. Therefore, the characteristic dependence of the analytic conductor on $N$ and $D$ for this family is $N D^2$.\n\n**Part 2: Natural D-scale of the Moment**\n\nThe $k$-th moment is given by\n$$\nM_{k}(D) = \\sum_{\\substack{\\lvert d \\rvert \\leq D \\\\ (d,N)=1}} \\left(L(\\frac{1}{2}, f \\otimes \\chi_{d})\\right)^{k}.\n$$\nTo deduce the natural $D$-scale from first principles, we analyze the structure of this sum. The size of the moment depends on two factors: the number of terms in the sum (the family size) and the average size of each term.\n\n1.  **Family Size**: The sum is over fundamental discriminants $d$ such that $\\lvert d \\rvert \\leq D$ and $(d,N)=1$. The number of fundamental discriminants $d$ with $\\lvert d \\rvert \\leq D$ is known to be asymptotically proportional to $D$, i.e., $\\sim c_1 D$ for a constant $c_1 = 6/\\pi^2$. The condition $(d,N)=1$ selects a subset of these discriminants with a certain density, which modifies the constant to $c_2$ (depending on $N$) but does not change the linear dependence on $D$. Thus, the number of terms in the sum is of order $D$.\n\n2.  **Average Value**: We consider the average value of $(L(\\frac{1}{2}, f \\otimes \\chi_{d}))^k$ over the family. A fundamental principle in the theory of L-functions is that, for a natural family, the main power-law growth of the moments comes from the size of the family itself. While the analytic conductor of individual L-functions in our family grows polynomially like $D^2$, the L-values themselves are not expected to grow polynomially. This is captured by the Lindelöf Hypothesis, which predicts $L(\\frac{1}{2}, f \\otimes \\chi_d) \\ll (N\\lvert d \\rvert^2)^{\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. The significant conductor growth is responsible for the appearance of logarithmic factors in the asymptotic formulas for moments (e.g., via the length of the approximate functional equation), but it does not contribute to the main power of $D$. All known proven results (for small $k$) and general conjectures (for any $k$) for such families show that the average value of $(L(\\frac{1}{2}))^k$ grows as a polynomial in $\\log D$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"natural $D$-scale,\" which means we should ignore these logarithmic factors and multiplicative constants. Therefore, the average value of $(L(\\frac{1}{2}, f \\otimes \\chi_{d}))^k$ is taken to be of order $1$ with respect to powers of $D$.\n\nCombining these principles:\n$$\nM_k(D) \\approx (\\text{Family Size}) \\times \\text{Average}((L(\\frac{1}{2}))^k) \\propto D \\times (\\text{poly-log factors}).\n$$\nIgnoring the logarithmic factors as requested, the natural $D$-scale of $M_k(D)$ is $D^1$.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n-   The leading-order dependence of the analytic conductor is $N D^2$.\n-   The natural $D$-scale of the $k$-th moment $M_k(D)$ is $D$.\nWe present these as a single row matrix as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN D^2 & D\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3018821"}, {"introduction": "The final practice bridges the gap between theoretical prediction and computational verification, a vital activity in contemporary number theory.

Generation of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a prime $q$ is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group of integers modulo $q$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, to the complex numbers of unit modulus. For a prime $q$, there are $q-1$ such characters. They can be systematically constructed using a primitive root $g$ modulo $q$. Every residue $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, q-1\\}$ is uniquely represented as a power of $g$, i.e., $a \\equiv g^t \\pmod{q}$ for a unique exponent $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, q-2\\}$. The exponent $t$ is the discrete logarithm of $a$ to the base $g$, denoted $t = \\operatorname{ind}_g(a)$.\n\nThe $q-1$ characters are indexed by an integer $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, q-2\\}$. The character $\\chi_k$ is defined by its action on $a \\equiv g^t \\pmod q$ as:\n$$\n\\chi_k(a) = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i k t}{q-1}\\right) = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i k \\,\\operatorname{ind}_g(a)}{q-1}\\right).\n$$\nBy convention, $\\chi_k(n) = 0$ if $q$ divides $n$. For a prime modulus $q$, the character $\\chi_0$ (with $k=0$) is the principal character, which is imprimitive. All other characters $\\chi_k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, q-2\\}$ are primitive. The summation in $M_2(q)$ thus runs over these $q-2$ characters.\n\nThe algorithm begins by finding a primitive root $g$ for each prime $q$ and pre-computing a table of discrete logarithms $\\operatorname{ind}_g(a)$ for all $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, q-1\\}$.\n\n### 2.

Root Number $\\varepsilon(\\chi)$\nThe root number $\\varepsilon(\\chi)$ is constructed from the Gauss sum $\\tau(\\chi)$ and the character's parity.\nThe Gauss sum for a character $\\chi$ modulo $q$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi) = \\sum_{a=1}^{q-1} \\chi(a) \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i a}{q}\\right).\n$$\nThe parity of $\\chi$ is determined by its value at $-1$. A parameter $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is defined such that $\\chi(-1) = (-1)^a$. For our construction $\\chi=\\chi_k$, we can find $\\operatorname{ind}_g(-1) = \\operatorname{ind}_g(q-1) = (q-1)/2$. Thus,\n$$\n\\chi_k(-1) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i k (q-1)/2}{q-1}\\right) = \\exp(\\pi i k) = (-1)^k.\n$$\nThis implies the parity parameter is simply $a_k = k \\pmod 2$.\nThe root number is then given by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\chi_k) = i^{-a_k} \\frac{\\tau(\\chi_k)}{\\sqrt{q}}.\n$$\nFor a primitive character, it is a known result that $|\\tau(\\chi)| = \\sqrt{q}$, which ensures that the root number has unit modulus, $|\\varepsilon(\\chi)|=1$.\n\n#### 2.2. Truncated Sum $S(\\chi)$\nThe sums in the definition of $L_{\\mathrm{num}}$ are infinite. For a numerical computation, they must be truncated. The weight function $W(n,q) = \\exp(-\\pi n^2/q)$ is chosen specifically because it decays very rapidly for $n \\gg \\sqrt{q}$. This allows for an effective truncation. We calculate a finite sum up to a limit $N_{\\text{trunc}}$:\n$$\nS(\\chi) \\approx \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\\text{trunc}}} \\frac{\\chi(n)}{\\sqrt{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\pi \\frac{n^2}{q}\\right).\n$$\nThe truncation length $N_{\\text{trunc}}$ must be chosen to balance accuracy and computational cost. A suitable choice ensures that the first neglected term, at $n=N_{\\text{trunc}}+1$, is smaller than the desired precision (e.g., machine epsilon for double precision, $\\approx 10^{-16}$). The magnitude of this term is approximately $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{\\text{trunc}}}} \\exp(-\\pi N_{\\text{trunc}}^2/q)$. Setting $N_{\\text{trunc}} = C \\sqrt{q}$ for some constant $C$, the exponential factor becomes $\\exp(-\\pi C^2)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing $C$ large enough. A choice of $C=4$ yields $\\exp(-16\\pi) \\approx 10^{-22}$, which is sufficient for high precision. Therefore, we set $N_{\\text{trunc}} = \\lceil 4\\sqrt{q} \\rceil$.\n\n### 3. Aggregation and Final Result\nThe algorithm proceeds by iterating through all primitive characters, i.e., for $k$ from $1$ to $q-2$. For each $\\chi_k$:\n1.  Compute the Gauss sum $\\tau(\\chi_k)$.\n2.  Determine the parity $a_k=k \\pmod 2$ and compute the root number $\\varepsilon(\\chi_k)$.\n3.  Compute the truncated sum $S(\\chi_k)$.\n4.  Assemble the surrogate $L_{\\mathrm{num}}(\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\chi_k) = S(\\chi_k) + \\varepsilon(\\chi_k) \\overline{S(\\chi_k)}$.\n5.  Calculate its squared magnitude $|L_{\\mathrm{num}}(\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\chi_k)|^2$ and add it to a running total.\n\nAfter summing over all $q-2$ primitive characters, the total is divided by $q-2$ to obtain the final average $M_2(q)$. This process is repeated for each prime $q$ in the test suite. The computational complexity is dominated by iterating through $q-2$ characters and, for each, computing a sum of length $N_{\\text{trunc}} \\propto \\sqrt{q}$, leading to a total complexity of roughly $O(q^{3/2})$. The use of vectorized operations in `numpy` makes this feasible for the specified values of $q$.\n\nThe expected behavior of $M_2(q)$ for large $q$ is governed by conjectures in random matrix theory and number theory, which predict $M_2(q) \\sim c \\log q$ for some constant $c$. The numerical experiment provides data points that can be compared against this predicted slow growth.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef _get_prime_factors(num):\n    \"\"\"Computes the set of prime factors of a given integer.\"\"\"\n    factors = set()\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.add(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.add(temp)\n    return list(factors)\n\ndef _find_primitive_root(p):\n    \"\"\"Finds a primitive root modulo a prime p.\"\"\"\n    if p == 2:\n        return 1\n    if p == 3:\n        return 2\n\n    phi = p - 1\n    prime_factors_phi = _get_prime_factors(phi)\n    \n    for g in range(2, p):\n        is_primitive = True\n        for factor in prime_factors_phi:\n            # Check if order of g is a proper divisor of phi\n            if pow(g, phi // factor, p) == 1:\n                is_primitive = False\n                break\n        if is_primitive:\n            return g\n    return -1  # Should not be reached for a prime p\n\ndef _compute_discrete_logs(g, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes a mapping from residue to discrete logarithm base g mod p.\"\"\"\n    log_map = {1: 0}\n    val = 1\n    for i in range(1, p - 1):\n        val = (val * g) % p\n        log_map[val] = i\n    return log_map\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes an approximation of the second moment of Dirichlet L-functions\n    at the central point for primitive characters modulo q.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [3, 17, 53]\n    results = []\n\n    # --- Discussion on Accuracy and Truncation ---\n    # The accuracy of the approximation depends on the truncation of the series.\n    # The weight W(n,q) = exp(-pi*n^2/q) decays rapidly.
