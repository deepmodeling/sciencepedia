I will verify this assertion.\n\nAn operator $\\Phi: I(\\chi_1, \\chi_2) \\to I(\\chi_2, \\chi_1)$ must be a $G$-morphism. For a function $f \\in I(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$, its image $\\phi = \\Phi(f)$ must belong to the space $I(\\chi_2, \\chi_1)$.

The initial calculation in the thought process had an error. I retract the prior conclusion. The operator defined in the problem *is* a valid intertwining operator from $I(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ to $I(\\chi_2, \\chi_1)$.\n\nThe problem is therefore valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Construction of the Spherical Vector\nThe space of the representation $I(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)=\\mathrm{Ind}_{B}^{G}(\\chi)$, where $\\chi = \\delta_B^{1/2}\\chi_1\\otimes\\chi_2$, consists of functions satisfying $f(bg) = \\chi(b)f(g)$. The group acts by right translation, $(g' \\cdot f)(g) = f(gg')$. A $K$-spherical vector $v_K$ is a function in this space that is also right-invariant under the maximal compact subgroup $K$, i.e., $v_K(gk) = v_K(g)$ for all $k \\in K$.\nBy the Iwasawa decomposition, any $g \\in G$ can be written as $g=bk$ for some $b \\in B, k \\in K$. For the spherical vector $v_K$, we have:\n$$ v_K(g) = v_K(bk) = v_K(b) $$\nUsing the defining property of functions in the induced representation space, we also have $v_K(b) = v_K(b \\cdot 1) = \\chi(b) v_K(1)$.\nThe vector is normalized by $v_K(1)=1$. Thus, for any $g \\in G$ with Iwasawa decomposition $g=b(g)k(g)$, the spherical vector is given by $v_K(g) = \\chi(b(g))$.\nSpecifically, if $g=bk$ where $b = \\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix}$ and $k \\in K$, then\n$$ v_K(g) = \\delta_B(b)^{1/2}\\chi_1(a)\\chi_2(d) = |a/d|^{1/2} \\chi_1(a) \\chi_2(d) $$\nThe intertwining operator is defined as stated in the problem.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Eigenvalue $c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$\nWe need to compute the scalar $c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ such that $A(w, \\chi_{1}, \\chi_{2}) v_{K} = c(\\chi_{1}, \\chi_{2}) v'_{K}$, where $v'_{K}$ is the normalized spherical vector in the target space $I(\\chi_2, \\chi_1)$. By evaluating both sides at the identity element $g=1$, we get:\n$$ c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2) = (A(w, \\chi_{1}, \\chi_{2}) v_{K})(1) = \\int_{F} v_K\\left(w^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\, dx $$\nLet $g_x = w^{-1}n(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & x \\end{pmatrix}$. We must find the Iwasawa decomposition of $g_x$ to evaluate $v_K(g_x)$. The integral is split into two domains: $\\{x \\in F : |x| \\leq 1\\} = \\mathfrak{o}$ and $\\{x \\in F : |x| > 1\\} = F \\setminus \\mathfrak{o}$.\n\n**Contribution from $\\{x \\in F: |x| \\leq 1\\} = \\mathfrak{o}$:**\nIf $x \\in \\mathfrak{o}$, then all matrix entries of $g_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & x \\end{pmatrix}$ are in $\\mathfrak{o}$. The determinant is $\\det(g_x) = 1$, which is a unit in $\\mathfrak{o}$. Therefore, for any $x \\in \\mathfrak{o}$, the matrix $g_x$ belongs to the maximal compact subgroup $K = \\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathfrak{o})$.\nFor $g_x \\in K$, its Iwasawa decomposition is trivial, e.g., $g_x = I \\cdot g_x$, where $I$ is the identity matrix (which is in $B$) and $g_x \\in K$.\nSo, $v_K(g_x) = \\chi(I) = 1$.\nThe integral over this region is:\n$$ \\int_{|x| \\leq 1} v_K(g_x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathfrak{o}} 1 \\, dx = \\mathrm{vol}(\\mathfrak{o}) = 1 $$\n\n**Contribution from $\\{x \\in F: |x| > 1\\}$:**\nFor $|x|>1$, we find the Iwasawa decomposition $g_x = bk$. We can write\n$$ g_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & x \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/x & -1 \\\\ 0 & x \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1/x & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet $b_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/x & -1 \\\\ 0 & x \\end{pmatrix}$ and $k_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1/x & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $|x|>1$, $|1/x|<1$, so $1/x \\in \\mathfrak{o}$. Thus $k_x \\in K$. The decomposition is $g_x = b_x k_x$.\nThen $v_K(g_x) = v_K(b_x k_x) = v_K(b_x) = \\chi(b_x)$.\n$$ v_K(g_x) = \\delta_B(b_x)^{1/2} \\chi_1(1/x) \\chi_2(x) = \\left|\\frac{1/x}{x}\\right|^{1/2} \\chi_1(x)^{-1} \\chi_2(x) = |x|^{-1} (\\chi_1^{-1}\\chi_2)(x) $$\nThe characters are unramified, so $\\chi_i(u)=1$ for $u \\in \\mathfrak{o}^{\\times}$. For any $y \\in F^\\times$, $y = \\varpi^n u$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $u \\in \\mathfrak{o}^\\times$. We have $|y|=|\\varpi^n|=q^{-n}$.\n$(\\chi_1^{-1}\\chi_2)(y) = \\chi_1(\\varpi)^{-n}\\chi_2(\\varpi)^n = (q^{-s_1})^{-n}(q^{-s_2})^n = q^{n(s_1-s_2)} = (q^{-n})^{-(s_1-s_2)} = |y|^{-(s_1-s_2)}$.\nSo $v_K(g_x) = |x|^{-1} |x|^{-(s_1-s_2)} = |x|^{-(s_1-s_2)-1}$.\nThe integral over this region is:\n$$ \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-(s_1-s_2)-1} \\, dx $$\nThe domain of integration is $F \\setminus \\mathfrak{o} = \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty \\{x \\in F: |x|=q^k\\}$. The measure of the annulus $\\{x: |x|=q^k\\}$ is $\\mathrm{vol}(\\varpi^{-k}\\mathfrak{o}^\\times) = |\\varpi^{-k}| \\mathrm{vol}(\\mathfrak{o}^\\times) = q^k(1-q^{-1})$.\nThe integral becomes a geometric series:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\int_{|x|=q^k} (q^k)^{-(s_1-s_2+1)} \\, dx = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} q^{-k(s_1-s_2+1)} \\cdot q^k(1-q^{-1}) = (1-q^{-1}) \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left(q^{-(s_1-s_2)}\\right)^k $$\nThis series converges if $|q^{-(s_1-s_2)}|<1$, which means $\\mathrm{Re}(s_1-s_2)>0$. Assuming convergence, the sum is $\\frac{q^{-(s_1-s_2)}}{1-q^{-(s_1-s_2)}}$.\nSo the contribution is $(1-q^{-1}) \\frac{q^{-(s_1-s_2)}}{1-q^{-(s_1-s_2)}}$.\nAdding the two contributions, we get $c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$:\n$$ c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2) = 1 + (1-q^{-1}) \\frac{q^{-(s_1-s_2)}}{1-q^{-(s_1-s_2)}} = \\frac{1-q^{-(s_1-s_2)} + (1-q^{-1})q^{-(s_1-s_2)}}{1-q^{-(s_1-s_2)}} = \\frac{1 - q^{-1}q^{-(s_1-s_2)}}{1-q^{-(s_1-s_2)}} $$\n\n### Part 3: Reducibility Condition\nThe principal series representation $I(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ is reducible if and only if the character ratio $\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1}$ is equal to $|\\cdot|$ or $|\\cdot|^{-1}$.\nThe character $\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1}$ is determined by its value on the uniformizer $\\varpi$:\n$$ (\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1})(\\varpi) = \\chi_1(\\varpi)\\chi_2(\\varpi)^{-1} = q^{-s_1}(q^{-s_2})^{-1} = q^{-(s_1-s_2)} $$\nThe character given by the absolute value, $\\psi(x)=|x|$, has $\\psi(\\varpi)=|\\varpi|=q^{-1}$.\nThe character given by its inverse, $\\psi^{-1}(x)=|x|^{-1}$, has $\\psi^{-1}(\\varpi)=|\\varpi|^{-1}=q$.\nSo, reducibility occurs if:\n1.  $\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1} = |\\cdot| \\implies q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = q^{-1}$.\n2.  $\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1} = |\\cdot|^{-1} \\implies q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = q$.\n\nThis result can be deduced from the properties of $c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$, whose analytic behavior governs the properties of the intertwining operator. Reducibility is linked to the poles of the normalized intertwining operator, which occur at the zeros of the unnormalized operator (or poles of the normalization factor).\nThe poles of $c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ are where its denominator vanishes: $1-q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = 0 \\implies q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = 1$. This corresponds to $\\chi_1=\\chi_2$.\nThe zeros of $c(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ are where its numerator vanishes: $1-q^{-1}q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = 0 \\implies q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = q$. This corresponds to the condition $\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1} = |\\cdot|^{-1}$.\nThe other reducibility point, $\\chi_1\\chi_2^{-1} = |\\cdot|$, comes from considering the inverse intertwining operator $A(w^{-1}, \\chi_2, \\chi_1)$, whose scalar eigenvalue would be $c(\\chi_2, \\chi_1) = \\frac{1 - q^{-1}q^{-(s_2-s_1)}}{1-q^{-(s_2-s_1)}}$. Its zeros occur when $q^{-(s_2-s_1)}=q$, which is $q^{s_1-s_2}=q$, or $q^{-(s_1-s_2)}=q^{-1}$.\n\nThe reducibility condition is therefore $q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = q$ or $q^{-(s_1-s_2)} = q^{-1}$.\nThe problem defines the reducibility discriminant $P(s_1, s_2) = (q^{-(s_1-s_2)} - q)(q^{-(s_1-s_2)} - q^{-1})$.\nThe vanishing of this expression, $P(s_1, s_2)=0$, is equivalent to the two conditions for reducibility derived above. The problem demands the explicit closed form for this expression, which is already given.\n\nThe product can be expanded:\n$P(s_1, s_2) = (q^{-(s_1-s_2)})^2 - (q+q^{-1})q^{-(s_1-s_2)} + q \\cdot q^{-1} = q^{-2(s_1-s_2)} - (q+q^{-1})q^{-(s_1-s_2)} + 1$.\nThe question asks for its explicit closed form.

Nesting condition: The character set of $\\Delta_{1}$ is $\\{\\nu^{0}, \\nu^{1}\\}$ and that of $\\Delta_{2}$ is $\\{\\nu^{-1}\\}$. Clearly, neither is a subset of the other. So, the segments are not nested.\n2.  Union condition: The union of the character sets is $\\{\\nu^{-1}, \\nu^{0}, \\nu^{1}\\}$. This set forms the segment $[\\nu^{-1}, \\nu^{1}]$, which is a valid segment.\n\nSince both conditions are met, the segments $\\Delta_{1}$ and $\\Delta_{2}$ are linked.\n\nAccording to a theorem of Zelevinsky, since the segments are linked, the induced representation $\\pi = Z(\\Delta_{1}) \\times Z(\\Delta_{2})$ is reducible. Its Jordan-Hölder constituents are in one-to-one correspondence with the multisegments that can be obtained from the initial multisegment $\\mathfrak{m}_{0} = \\{\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}\\}$ by applying a sequence of elementary moves.\n\nAn elementary move transforms a multisegment $\\mathfrak{m}$ into a new multisegment $\\mathfrak{m}'$ by selecting two linked segments $\\Delta_{i}, \\Delta_{j} \\in \\mathfrak{m}$ and replacing them with the pair of segments $\\{\\Delta_{i} \\cup \\Delta_{j}, \\Delta_{i} \\cap \\Delta_{j}\\}$. If the intersection is the empty set, it is omitted from the new multisegment.\n\nLet's apply this process starting with our initial multisegment $\\mathfrak{m}_{0} = \\{[\\nu^{0}, \\nu^{1}], [\\nu^{-1}]\\}$.\nThe two segments in $\\mathfrak{m}_{0}$ are linked, so we can perform an elementary move.\n- The union is $\\Delta_{1} \\cup \\Delta_{2} = [\\nu^{-1}, \\nu^{1}]$.\n- The intersection is $\\Delta_{1} \\cap \\Delta_{2} = \\emptyset$. The empty segment is discarded.\n\nThe elementary move thus transforms $\\mathfrak{m}_{0}$ into a new multisegment $\\mathfrak{m}_{1}$:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{m}_{0} = \\{[\\nu^{0}, \\nu^{1}], [\\nu^{-1}]\\} \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad \\mathfrak{m}_{1} = \\{[\\nu^{-1}, \\nu^{1}]\\}\n$$\nThe multisegment $\\mathfrak{m}_{1}$ contains only a single segment. Since an elementary move requires a pair of linked segments, no further moves are possible from $\\mathfrak{m}_{1}$.\n\nThe set of all multisegments that can be generated from $\\mathfrak{m}_{0}$ is $\\{\\mathfrak{m}_{0}, \\mathfrak{m}_{1}\\}$. There are two distinct multisegments in this set. Each of these multisegments corresponds to a unique irreducible constituent in the Jordan-Hölder series of $\\pi$.\n\nThe two irreducible constituents are:\n1.  $L(\\mathfrak{m}_{0}) = L(\\{[\\nu^{0}, \\nu^{1}], [\\nu^{-1}]\\})$, which is the unique irreducible quotient of $\\pi$.\n2.  $L(\\mathfrak{m}_{1}) = L(\\{[\\nu^{-1}, \\nu^{1}]\\}) = Z([\\nu^{-1}, \\nu^{1}])$, which is an essentially square-integrable representation (specifically, a twist of the Steinberg representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_{3}(F)$). It is a subquotient of $\\pi$.\n\nThe number of composition factors is the number of such multisegments we can generate. Since we have found $2$ distinct multisegments, the composition length of $\\pi$ is $2$.\nTherefore, $\\ell(\\pi) = 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3008646"}, {"introduction": "The profound insights of the local theory ultimately serve the global Langlands program, which forges deep connections between automorphic representations and number theory.

We will address each part in sequence, beginning with the criterion for cuspidality, followed by an explicit example of non-cuspidal induction, and concluding with a calculation of the order of a pole for a specific Rankin-Selberg $L$-function.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for an explanation of why the automorphic induction $\\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\pi)$ is cuspidal under the hypothesis that the cuspidal representation $\\pi$ of $\\mathrm{GL}_r(\\mathbb{A}_E)$ is not isomorphic to any of its Galois conjugates $\\pi^\\sigma$ for $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$, $\\sigma \\neq 1$.\n\nThe theory of automorphic induction, established by Arthur and Clozel, provides a deep connection between the properties of an automorphic representation and its functorial lift. Let $\\pi$ be a cuspidal automorphic representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_r(\\mathbb{A}_E)$. The Langlands correspondence associates to $\\pi$ an $r$-dimensional, irreducible, complex representation $\\phi_\\pi$ of the Weil group $W_E$ of the field $E$. The automorphic induction $\\Pi = \\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\pi)$ is an automorphic representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_{mr}(\\mathbb{A}_F)$ whose $L$-parameter $\\Phi_\\Pi$ is given by the representation of $W_F$ induced from $\\phi_\\pi$:\n$$\n\\Phi_\\Pi = \\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(\\phi_\\pi)\n$$\nA central result in the theory states that the automorphic representation $\\Pi = \\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\pi)$ is cuspidal if and only if its $L$-parameter $\\Phi_\\Pi$ is an irreducible representation of $W_F$.\n\nWe must therefore determine the condition for the irreducibility of the induced representation $\\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(\\phi_\\pi)$. Since $E/F$ is a Galois extension, $W_E$ is a normal subgroup of $W_F$, and the quotient group $W_F/W_E$ is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. For a normal subgroup, Mackey's criterion for irreducibility of an induced representation states that $\\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(\\phi_\\pi)$ is irreducible if and only if $\\phi_\\pi$ is not isomorphic to any of its conjugates $\\phi_\\pi^g$ for any element $g \\in W_F \\setminus W_E$.\n\nAn element $g \\in W_F$ acts on the set of representations of $W_E$. The representation $\\phi_\\pi^g$ is defined by $\\phi_\\pi^g(w) = \\phi_\\pi(g^{-1}wg)$ for $w \\in W_E$. The isomorphism class of $\\phi_\\pi^g$ depends only on the image of $g$ in the quotient group $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. We denote this conjugate representation by $\\phi_\\pi^\\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the image of $g$ in $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. The condition for irreducibility of $\\Phi_\\Pi$ is therefore that $\\phi_\\pi$ is not isomorphic to $\\phi_\\pi^\\sigma$ for any non-trivial element $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$, i.e., $\\sigma \\neq 1$.\n\nBy the strong multiplicity one theorem for $\\mathrm{GL}_r$, two cuspidal automorphic representations are isomorphic if and only if their associated $L$-parameters are isomorphic. Thus, the condition $\\phi_\\pi \\not\\cong \\phi_\\pi^\\sigma$ is equivalent to the condition on the automorphic representations themselves: $\\pi \\not\\cong \\pi^\\sigma$.\n\nIn summary, the chain of equivalences is as follows:\n$\\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\pi)$ is cuspidal $\\iff \\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(\\phi_\\pi)$ is irreducible $\\iff \\phi_\\pi \\not\\cong \\phi_\\pi^\\sigma$ for all $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(E/F) \\setminus \\{1\\} \\iff \\pi \\not\\cong \\pi^\\sigma$ for all $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(E/F) \\setminus \\{1\\}$. This explains the given criterion.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an explicit example where automorphic induction produces a noncuspidal representation. This occurs when the cuspidality condition fails, i.e., when $\\pi \\cong \\pi^\\sigma$ for some $\\sigma \\neq 1$. A canonical way to construct such a representation $\\pi$ is to take it to be the base change of an automorphic representation from an intermediate field between $F$ and $E$. The simplest case is when $\\pi$ is the base change of a representation $\\sigma_0$ from $F$ itself, i.e., $\\pi = \\mathrm{BC}_{E/F}(\\sigma_0)$. In this case, $\\pi$ is invariant under the action of the entire Galois group $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$, so $\\pi^\\sigma \\cong \\pi$ for all $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$.\n\nLet us construct an explicit example. Let $F = \\mathbb{Q}$, the field of rational numbers, and $E = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$, the field of Gaussian rationals. This is a cyclic extension of degree $m=2$. Let $\\sigma_0$ be the trivial character on $\\mathrm{GL}_1(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}})$, which we denote by $1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Its base change to $E$ is the trivial character on $\\mathrm{GL}_1(\\mathbb{A}_{E})$, denoted $\\chi = 1_{E}$. Since $\\chi^\\sigma = (1_E)^\\sigma = 1_E = \\chi$ for the non-trivial element $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$, the condition for cuspidality is violated.\n\nThe automorphic induction $\\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\chi)$ is a representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}})$. By Frobenius reciprocity on the level of $L$-parameters, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(\\phi_{\\mathrm{BC}_{E/F}(\\sigma_0)}) = \\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(\\mathrm{Res}_{W_E}^{W_F}(\\phi_{\\sigma_0})) \\cong \\phi_{\\sigma_0} \\otimes \\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(1_{W_E})\n$$\nThe representation $\\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(1_{W_E})$ of $W_F$ factors through $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$ and corresponds to the regular representation of $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. For our quadratic extension, $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$ has two characters: the trivial character $1$ and the non-trivial quadratic character $\\omega_{E/F}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Ind}_{W_E}^{W_F}(1_{W_E}) \\cong 1 \\oplus \\omega_{E/F}$.\nThe $L$-parameter of $\\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\chi)$ is therefore $\\phi_{1_{\\mathbb{Q}}} \\otimes (1 \\oplus \\omega_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}) = \\phi_{1_{\\mathbb{Q}}} \\oplus (\\phi_{1_{\\mathbb{Q}}} \\otimes \\omega_{E/\\mathbb{Q}})$. This corresponds to the isobaric sum:\n$$\n\\mathrm{AI}_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}(1_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)}) = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\boxplus (1_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\otimes \\omega_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}) = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\boxplus \\omega_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the character of $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^\\times$ associated to the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}$. An isobaric sum is a representation induced from a proper parabolic subgroup (in this case, the Borel subgroup of $\\mathrm{GL}_2$) and is therefore an Eisenstein series. By definition, an Eisenstein series is not cuspidal. This provides the required example.\n\nThe third part asks for the order of the pole at $s=1$ of $L(s, \\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\chi) \\times \\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\chi)^\\vee)$ for $E=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, $F=\\mathbb{Q}$, and $\\chi$ the trivial Hecke character on $\\mathbb{A}_{E}^\\times$.\nLet $\\Pi = \\mathrm{AI}_{E/F}(\\chi)$. From our work above, we have identified this representation as an isobaric sum:\n$$\n\\Pi = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\boxplus \\omega\n$$\nwhere $1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the trivial character of $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^\\times$ and $\\omega \\equiv \\omega_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the associated quadratic character. The contragredient representation $\\Pi^\\vee$ is given by $\\Pi^\\vee = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}^\\vee \\boxplus \\omega^\\vee$. The trivial character is its own contragredient, $1_{\\mathbb{Q}}^\\vee = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. The character $\\omega$ takes values in $\\{\\pm 1\\}$, so it is also its own contragredient, $\\omega^\\vee = \\omega$. Therefore, $\\Pi^\\vee = \\Pi$.\n\nWe need to analyze the poles of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s, \\Pi \\times \\Pi)$. For isobaric sums, the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function is multiplicative over the components:\n$$\nL(s, (\\sigma_1 \\boxplus \\sigma_2) \\times (\\tau_1 \\boxplus \\tau_2)) = L(s, \\sigma_1 \\times \\tau_1) L(s, \\sigma_1 \\times \\tau_2) L(s, \\sigma_2 \\times \\tau_1) L(s, \\sigma_2 \\times \\tau_2)\n$$\nApplying this to $L(s, \\Pi \\times \\Pi)$:\n$$\nL(s, \\Pi \\times \\Pi) = L(s, 1_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\times 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}) L(s, 1_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\times \\omega) L(s, \\omega \\times 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}) L(s, \\omega \\times \\omega)\n$$\nFor characters $\\psi_1, \\psi_2$ of $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^\\times$, the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function is the Hecke $L$-function of their product: $L(s, \\psi_1 \\times \\psi_2) = L(s, \\psi_1 \\psi_2)$. So we have:\n$$\nL(s, \\Pi \\times \\Pi) = L(s, 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}) L(s, \\omega) L(s, \\omega) L(s, \\omega^2)\n$$\nWe analyze the pole at $s=1$ for each factor using the properties given in the problem statement.\n1.  $L(s, 1_{\\mathbb{Q}})$: This is the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$. It has a simple pole (order $1$) at $s=1$. This corresponds to the case $L(s, \\sigma \\times \\sigma^\\vee)$ with $\\sigma = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$, which is unitary.\n2.  $L(s, \\omega)$: This is the Dirichlet $L$-function for the non-trivial character $\\omega$. It is holomorphic everywhere, including at $s=1$. This corresponds to the case $L(s, \\sigma \\times \\tau^\\vee)$ with $\\sigma = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ and $\\tau = \\omega^{-1} = \\omega$, which are not isomorphic. The order of the pole is $0$.\n3.  $L(s, \\omega)$: Same as the previous term, the order of the pole is $0$.\n4.  $L(s, \\omega^2)$: Since $\\omega$ is a quadratic character, $\\omega^2 = 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. So this factor is $L(s, 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}) = \\zeta(s)$, which has a simple pole at $s=1$. This corresponds to the case $L(s, \\sigma \\times \\sigma^\\vee)$ with the unitary character $\\sigma=\\omega$. The order of the pole is $1$.\n\nThe order of the pole of the product is the sum of the orders of the poles of the individual factors.\n$$\n\\mathrm{ord}_{s=1} L(s, \\Pi \\times \\Pi^\\vee) = \\mathrm{ord}_{s=1} \\zeta(s) + \\mathrm{ord}_{s=1} L(s, \\omega) + \\mathrm{ord}_{s=1} L(s, \\omega) + \\mathrm{ord}_{s=1} \\zeta(s)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{ord}_{s=1} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2\n$$\nThe order of the pole at $s=1$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3008670"}]}
