No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of a divisor class on projective space, the condition for its ampleness, and the relation of this condition to Vojta's conjectures and the Schmidt Subspace Theorem.\n\nFirst, we compute the linear equivalence class of the divisor $K_X + D$ on the variety $X = \\mathbb{P}^n$. The Picard group of $X = \\mathbb{P}^n$, denoted $\\operatorname{Pic}(X)$, which parameterizes linear equivalence classes of divisors, is known to be isomorphic to the integers, $\\operatorname{Pic}(\\mathbb{P}^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This group is generated by the class of a hyperplane, which we denote by $H$. Any divisor class on $\\mathbb{P}^n$ is thus an integer multiple of $H$.\n\nThe canonical divisor of $\\mathbb{P}^n$, denoted $K_X$, has a well-known class in $\\operatorname{Pic}(X)$. It is given by the adjunction formula or by direct computation of the divisor of a global rational $n$-form. In terms of the hyperplane class $H$, its class is:\n$$[K_X] = -(n+1)H$$\n\nThe divisor $D$ is given as a sum of $r$ distinct hyperplanes in general position, $D = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} H_i$. Since each $H_i$ is a hyperplane, its divisor class is $[H_i] = H$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, r\\}$. Because the map from divisors to the Picard group is a homomorphism, the class of $D$ is the sum of the classes of its components:\n$$[D] = \\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{r} H_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} [H_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} H = rH$$\n\nNow we can compute the class of the divisor $K_X + D$ by adding the respective classes in the Picard group:\n$$[K_X + D] = [K_X] + [D] = -(n+1)H + rH = (r - (n+1))H$$\nThis shows that the divisor $K_X + D$ is linearly equivalent to a divisor whose class is $(r - (n+1))H$.\n\nSecond, we determine when $K_X + D$ is an ample divisor. For a divisor on $\\mathbb{P}^n$, the condition for ampleness is particularly simple due to the structure of its cone of effective divisors. A divisor on $\\mathbb{P}^n$ is ample if and only if its class in $\\operatorname{Pic}(\\mathbb{P}^n)$ is a positive integer multiple of the hyperplane class $H$. This is the Nakai-Moishezon criterion as applied to $\\mathbb{P}^n$.\nFrom our previous calculation, we have $[K_X + D] = (r - (n+1))H$. For this divisor to be ample, the coefficient of $H$ must be a positive integer. That is:\n$$r - (n+1) > 0$$\nThis strict inequality for the integer $r$ is equivalent to:\n$$r > n+1$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal integer $r_{\\min}(n)$ such that for all integers $r \\geq r_{\\min}(n)$, the divisor $K_X+D$ is ample. The smallest integer value of $r$ that satisfies the condition $r > n+1$ is $(n+1)+1 = n+2$. Therefore, the minimal threshold is:\n$$r_{\\min}(n) = n+2$$\n\nThird, we briefly explain the connection of this result to Vojta's conjectures and the Schmidt Subspace Theorem (SST). Vojta's conjectures create a bridge between the geometry of an algebraic variety and the arithmetic of its rational or integral points. A key principle is that on an open variety $U = X \\setminus D$, the set of $S$-integral points is expected to be sparse (in fact, not Zariski dense) if the log canonical divisor $K_X + D$ is \"positive\" (e.g., ample or big). Our calculation shows that for $X = \\mathbb{P}^n$ and $D$ being the sum of $r$ hyperplanes in general position, $K_X + D$ is ample precisely when $r \\geq n+2$. Vojta's conjecture thus predicts that for $r \\geq n+2$, the set of $S$-integral points on $\\mathbb{P}^n \\setminus D$ should be \"degenerate,\" which in this case means finite.\n\nThis prediction is confirmed by the Schmidt Subspace Theorem, a deep result in Diophantine approximation. A powerful version of the SST, proven by Evertse, Schlickewei, and Schmidt, states that for $r$ hyperplanes in general position in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ over a number field $k$, the set of $S$-integral points on the complement $\\mathbb{P}^n \\setminus D$ is finite if and only if $r > n+1$. This condition is equivalent to $r \\geq n+2$ since $r$ is an integer. Thus, the threshold $r_{\\min}(n) = n+2$ derived from the geometric condition of ampleness is precisely the same threshold that governs the arithmetic finiteness of integral points. This perfect alignment between the geometric prediction (ampleness of $K_X+D$) and the proven arithmetic result (finiteness of integral points via SST) provides strong evidence for the correctness of Vojta's conjectures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n+2}$$", "id": "3031089"}, {"introduction": "The statement of the Subspace Theorem involves an intricate inequality built from products of local absolute values over a set of places $S$.

A version of the Subspace Theorem states that for linear forms $L_1, \\dots, L_m$ on $\\mathbb{Q}^n$ in general position, a finite set of places $S$, and any $\\delta>0$, the solutions $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^n$ to the inequality\n$$ \\prod_{v\\in S}\\prod_{i=1}^{m} |L_i(\\mathbf{x})|_v < H(\\mathbf{x})^{m-n-\\delta} $$\nlie in a finite union of proper linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{Q}^n$. Here, $H(\\mathbf{x})$ is a height function, typically $H(\\mathbf{x}) = \\max_i |x_i|$.\nIn our problem, $n=2$, $m=3$, so the exponent is $3-2-\\delta = 1-\\delta$. The height is $H(\\mathbf{x})=\\max\\{|24|,|9|\\}=24$. The product on the left-hand side is:\n$$ \\prod_{v\\in S}\\prod_{i=1}^{3} |L_i(\\mathbf{x})|_v = (24 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 33) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}) = (7128) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{8}) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{81}) = \\frac{7128}{648} = 11 $$\nThe inequality becomes $11 < 24^{1-\\delta}$. This is false for any $\\delta>0$, since $24^{1-\\delta} \\le 24^1 = 24$, but more rigorously, we need $1-\\delta > \\log_{24}(11) \\approx 0.755$.

The inequality $\\prod_{v \\in S} \\prod_{i=1}^{m} |L_{i,v}(x)|_v / \\|x\\|_v^m \\leq H(x)^{-\\epsilon}$ describes points $x$ that are, in a multiplicative sense, simultaneously \"close\" to the hyperplanes defined by $\\ker(L_{i,v})$ for all $i$ and $v$.\n\nIf, for a given $v \\in S$, the forms $\\{L_{1,v}, \\dots, L_{m,v}\\}$ are linearly independent, their kernels $\\ker(L_{i,v})$ are $m-1$ distinct hyperplanes whose common intersection is just the origin $\\{0\\}$. For a point $x$ to be simultaneously \"close\" to all these hyperplanes, it must be \"close\" to the origin. The Subspace Theorem essentially states that this geometric constraint, when combined over several places $v \\in S$ and tied to the height $H(x)$, is so strong that the only solutions are those lying in specific, fixed \"degenerate\" configurations (proper $K$-subspaces).\n\nHowever, if for some place $v_0 \\in S$, the forms $\\{L_{1,v_0}, \\dots, L_{m,v_0}\\}$ are linearly dependent, there exists a non-trivial relation $\\sum_{i=1}^m c_i L_{i,v_0} = 0$ with $c_i \\in K_{v_0}$ not all zero. This implies that the intersection of the kernels, $W = \\bigcap_{i=1}^m \\ker(L_{i,v_0})$, is a non-trivial subspace of $K_{v_0}^m$ (i.e., $\\dim(W) \\geq 1$). Any point $x \\in W$ makes $L_{i,v_0}(x) = 0$ for all $i=1,\\dots,m$. Any point $x$ that is \"close\" to the subspace $W$ in the $v_0$-adic topology will have very small values for all $|L_{i,v_0}(x)|_{v_0}$. This creates a large set of candidates for solutions, potentially violating the \"sparsity\" conclusion of the theorem. We can construct an infinite sequence of points $x_N \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^m$ that are not confined to a finite set of proper $K$-subspaces, but which get progressively closer to the subspace $W$ in the $v_0$-adic topology, making the product $\\prod_i |L_{i,v_0}(x_N)|_{v_0}$ small enough to satisfy the inequality.\n\nWith this understanding, we evaluate the options.\n\n**A. The independence of the $L_{i,v}$ is needed to ensure that, for each $v \\in S$, the associated $K_{v}$-linear map $T_{v}: K_{v}^{m} \\to K_{v}^{m}$ given by $x \\mapsto (L_{1,v}(x),\\dots,L_{m,v}(x))$ is an isomorphism, so that the product $\\prod_{i=1}^{m} |L_{i,v}(x)|_{v}$ dominates (up to a constant depending only on $v$ and the choice of norms) a fixed positive power of $\\|x\\|_{v}$ for all $x$. If independence is dropped at even a single place, one can construct a counterexample over $K=\\mathbb{Q}$ with $S=\\{\\infty,p\\}$ for a fixed prime $p$: take $m=2$, $L_{1,\\infty}(x,y)=x$, $L_{2,\\infty}(x,y)=y$ (independent at $\\infty$), and $L_{1,p}(x,y)=x$, $L_{2,p}(x,y)=x$ (dependent at $p$). Then for $x_{N}=(p^{N},1)$ and any $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$ one has $\\prod_{v \\in S} \\prod_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{|L_{i,v}(x_{N})|_{v}}{\\|x_{N}\\|_{v}} \\ll p^{-N} \\leq H(x_{N})^{-\\epsilon}$, yielding infinitely many solutions not contained in any finite union of proper $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{Q}^{2}$, since the set $\\{(p^{N},1): N \\geq 1\\}$ is not contained in any line through the origin.**\n\nThis option has two parts: a justification for the role of independence, and an explicit counterexample.\n1.  **Justification**: The claim that independence of the forms implies the map $T_v$ is an isomorphism is correct by definition of linear independence for $m$ forms in $m$ variables. The subsequent claim that this implies $\\prod_{i=1}^{m} |L_{i,v}(x)|_{v}$ \"dominates ... a fixed positive power of $\\|x\\|_{v}$ for all $x$\" (i.e., $\\prod_i |L_{i,v}(x)|_v \\ge C \\|x\\|_v^\\alpha$ for some $C, \\alpha>0$) is technically incorrect. For example, with $m=2$, $L_{1,\\infty}(x_1,x_2)=x_1$, $L_{2,\\infty}(x_1,x_2)=x_2$, and $x=(\\delta,1)$, $\\|x\\|_\\infty \\approx 1$, while the product $|L_{1,\\infty}(x)|_\\infty |L_{2,\\infty}(x)|_\\infty = |\\delta|$ can be arbitrarily small. However, this statement attempts to express the intuition that independence prevents the product from becoming pathologically small for \"most\" points.\n2.  **Counterexample**: Let us rigorously verify the example.\n    -   Let $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, $m=2$, $S=\\{\\infty, p\\}$. The forms are as given. The set $\\{L_{1,p}, L_{2,p}\\}=\\{x,x\\}$ is linearly dependent over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n    -   Consider the points $x_N=(p^N, 1) \\in \\mathcal{O}_\\mathbb{Q}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ for $N \\geq 1$.\n    -   We use the max-norm: $\\|(a,b)\\|_v = \\max(|a|_v, |b|_v)$.\n    -   At $v=\\infty$: $| \\cdot |_\\infty$ is the standard absolute value.\n        $\\|x_N\\|_\\infty = \\max(p^N, 1) = p^N$.\n        The term for $v=\\infty$ is $\\frac{|L_{1,\\infty}(x_N)|_\\infty |L_{2,\\infty}(x_N)|_\\infty}{\\|x_N\\|_\\infty^2} = \\frac{|p^N|_\\infty |1|_\\infty}{(p^N)^2} = \\frac{p^N}{p^{2N}} = p^{-N}$.\n    -   At $v=p$: $|\\cdot|_p$ is the $p$-adic absolute value with $|p|_p = p^{-1}$.\n        $\\|x_N\\|_p = \\max(|p^N|_p, |1|_p) = \\max(p^{-N}, 1) = 1$.\n        The term for $v=p$ is $\\frac{|L_{1,p}(x_N)|_p |L_{2,p}(x_N)|_p}{\\|x_N\\|_p^2} = \\frac{|p^N|_p |p^N|_p}{1^2} = (p^{-N})(p^{-N}) = p^{-2N}$.\n    -   The left-hand side (LHS) of the inequality is the product over $S$: $LHS = (p^{-N})(p^{-2N}) = p^{-3N}$.\n    -   The height of $x_N=(p^N, 1)$ (with coprime integer components) is $H(x_N) = \\max(p^N, 1) = p^N$. The right-hand side (RHS) is $H(x_N)^{-\\epsilon} = (p^N)^{-\\epsilon} = p^{-N\\epsilon}$.\n    -   The inequality is $p^{-3N} \\leq p^{-N\\epsilon}$, which is equivalent to $-3N \\leq -N\\epsilon$, or $3 \\ge \\epsilon$. This is satisfied for any $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, as stated in the option. The chain of reasoning presented, $LHS \\ll p^{-N} \\leq H(x_{N})^{-\\epsilon}$, is also sound for $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$.\n    -   The set of solutions $\\{(p^N, 1) : N \\geq 1\\}$ consists of vectors that are pairwise linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, this infinite set cannot be contained in any finite union of proper $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{Q}^2$ (which are lines through the origin).\n    -   The counterexample is correct and successfully demonstrates that the conclusion of the Subspace Theorem fails when the independence hypothesis is dropped.\n\nDespite the imprecision in the initial justification, the core of the option—the construction of a valid and illustrative counterexample as requested by the prompt—is entirely correct. Among the given choices, this option provides the most substantial and accurate analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The independence hypothesis can be dropped entirely if one assumes merely that the total number of linear forms $q$ is at least $m$; the Subspace Theorem’s conclusion remains valid without change.**\n\nThis is false. The counterexample constructed in Option A shows that dropping the independence hypothesis at a single place is enough to violate the theorem's conclusion. Option A's setup has $m=2$ forms at each of the $|S|=2$ places, so the total number of forms is $4 \\ge m=2$, but the theorem fails.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If independence fails, then all solutions to the inequality must lie in the intersection of the kernels of the dependent forms, hence in a single proper subspace; independence is therefore inessential for the finiteness-of-subspaces conclusion.**\n\nThis is false. The argument is flawed and the conclusion is wrong. In the counterexample from Option A, the dependent forms at place $p$ are $L_{1,p}(x,y)=x$ and $L_{2,p}(x,y)=x$. The intersection of their kernels is the subspace defined by $x=0$, i.e., the set of points $\\{(0,y) : y \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p\\}$. The solutions we found were $x_N=(p^N, 1)$. These points clearly do not lie in this subspace. The solutions are merely \"p-adically close\" to this subspace, they are not elements of it. Therefore, the premise of the argument is false. Consequently, the conclusion that independence is \"inessential\" is also false, as demonstrated by the failure of the theorem in the counterexample.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Even if independence fails at exactly one nonarchimedean place $v \\in S$, the inequality forces that there are only finitely many solutions outside a finite union of proper $K$-linear subspaces; dependence at a single place cannot create infinite families of solutions avoiding these subspaces.**\n\nThis is a direct contradiction of the findings from the analysis of Option A. The counterexample in Option A demonstrates precisely that linear dependence at a single nonarchimedean place ($v=p$) can and does create an infinite family of solutions ($x_N=(p^N,1)$) that cannot be contained in a finite union of proper $K$-linear subspaces.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3031144"}]}
