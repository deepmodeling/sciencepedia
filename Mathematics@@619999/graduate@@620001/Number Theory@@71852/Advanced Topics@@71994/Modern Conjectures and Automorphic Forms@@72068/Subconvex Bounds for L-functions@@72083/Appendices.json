A small $H$ corresponds to a very localized analysis in the original variable $n$, leading to a wide frequency support (the $\\frac{q}{H}$ term) in the dual sum over $m$. Conversely, a large $H$ reduces the frequency support but can be problematic for other reasons, such as capturing the variation of the coefficients $a_n$ or the smooth weight $V(x/N)$. The principle of balancing these two competing effects is a common heuristic in Fourier analysis and number theory, often referred to as an application of the uncertainty principle.\n\nTo find the optimal $H$, we need to find the minimum of the function.

Within this support, $x$ is of size $O(X)$. The integral is therefore bounded by the product of the integrand's size, $O(X^{-1/2})$, and the integration length, $O(X)$. This gives a trivial bound of $O(X^{1/2})$.\n\nThe magnitude of the stationary phase contribution is:\n$$\n|I_{\\mathrm{main}}(q,n,X)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{q^{1/2}} W\\left(\\frac{n}{q^2 X}\\right) \\exp\\left(i\\frac{\\pi}{4} - i\\frac{2\\pi n}{q}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{q^{1/2}} \\left|W\\left(\\frac{n}{q^2 X}\\right)\\right|\n$$\nSince $x_0=\\rho$ is in the support of $W(x/X)$, the term $|W(n/(q^2 X))|$ is of order $O(1)$. Thus, the magnitude of the integral is $O(q^{-1/2})$.\n\nThe \"saving\" comes from the cancellation due to the oscillatory exponential. It is quantified by the ratio of the asymptotic size to the trivial bound. The analysis reveals that the rapid oscillations reduce the integral's magnitude from a trivial estimate of $O(X^{1/2})$ to a much smaller size of $O(q^{-1/2})$.

Thus, the exponent of $Q$ in the final bound is $\\max\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}, \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThis expression reveals the fundamental trade-off of the amplification method.\nThe term $Q^{1/2 - \\lambda/2}$ arises from the diagonal contribution. Its exponent, $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$, is a decreasing function of $\\lambda$. This means a longer amplifier (larger $\\lambda$) is more effective at reducing the size of the diagonal term relative to the amplification factor.\nThe term $Q^{1/4 + \\lambda/2}$ arises from the off-diagonal contribution. Its exponent, $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$, is an increasing function of $\\lambda$. A longer amplifier introduces more complex cross-correlations, and the error term associated with them grows.\n\nTo obtain the strongest possible bound (i.e., the smallest possible exponent for $Q$), we must choose $\\lambda$ to minimize this maximum. The minimum of the maximum of a decreasing function and an increasing function occurs at their intersection point. We therefore balance the two exponents by setting them equal to each other:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} $$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{4} = \\lambda $$\nThe optimal choice for the amplifier length parameter is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{4}$, which corresponds to an amplifier of length $L = Q^{1/4}$. This value lies within the stipulated range $0 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$.\n\nWe now substitute this optimal value of $\\lambda$ back into either exponent expression to find the minimized exponent of $Q$.\n$$ \\text{Exponent} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nChecking with the other expression gives the same result:\n$$ \\text{Exponent} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nThus, the optimized bound is $|L(1/2, \\pi_0 \\otimes \\chi)| \\ll Q^{3/8 + \\varepsilon}$. The convexity bound for this L-function is $Q^{1/2}$, so $3/8$ represents a subconvex exponent, as $3/8 < 1/2$. The question asks for this single optimized exponent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "3024110"}]}
