It is a well-posed question in algebraic number theory, based on established principles and free of any scientific or logical flaws. We are asked to derive the conductor of a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ using a specified set of foundational facts.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ be a quadratic field, where $d$ is a squarefree integer. This is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, which is abelian. The Kronecker-Weber theorem, given as a foundational fact, states that every finite abelian extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is contained in a cyclotomic field. The conductor of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted $f(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is defined as the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$, where $\\zeta_m = \\exp(2\\pi i / m)$.\n\nThe arithmetic of an abelian extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is governed by its character group $X = \\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}), \\mathbb{C}^\\times)$. Since $\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $2$, the character group $X$ also has order $2$. It consists of the trivial character, which we denote by $1$, and a single non-trivial quadratic character, which we denote by $\\chi_K$.\n\nA fundamental result in analytic number theory relates the Dedekind zeta function of $K$, $\\zeta_K(s)$, to the Dirichlet L-functions associated with the characters in $X$:\n$$\n\\zeta_K(s) = \\prod_{\\chi \\in X} L(s, \\chi)\n$$\nIn our case, $X = \\{1, \\chi_K\\}$, and since $L(s, 1) = \\zeta(s)$ (the Riemann zeta function), this factorization becomes:\n$$\n\\zeta_K(s) = L(s, 1) L(s, \\chi_K) = \\zeta(s) L(s, \\chi_K)\n$$\nThe problem statement provides the identity $\\zeta_K(s) = \\zeta(s) L(s, \\chi_{\\Delta_K})$, where $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}(n) = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{n}\\right)$ is the Dirichlet character given by the Kronecker symbol, and $\\Delta_K$ is the fundamental discriminant of $K$. Comparing these two expressions for $\\zeta_K(s)$, we uniquely identify the non-trivial character of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ as $\\chi_K = \\chi_{\\Delta_K}$.\n\nAccording to the theory of abelian extensions (a consequence of class field theory), the conductor of the extension $f(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is determined by the conductors of the characters in its character group $X$. Specifically, $f(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the least common multiple of the conductors of all characters $\\chi \\in X$:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathrm{lcm}_{\\chi \\in X} \\{ f(\\chi) \\}\n$$\nFor our quadratic field, this is:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathrm{lcm}(f(1), f(\\chi_K))\n$$\nThe conductor of the trivial character $f(1)$ is $1$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = f(\\chi_K) = f(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})\n$$\nThe problem is therefore reduced to determining the conductor of the Dirichlet character $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$. The character $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$ is defined using the Kronecker symbol with the fundamental discriminant $\\Delta_K$. A cornerstone result concerning such characters is that if $D$ is a fundamental discriminant, the character $\\chi_D(n) = \\left(\\frac{D}{n}\\right)$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo $|D|$. By definition, the conductor of a primitive character is its modulus.\nSince $\\Delta_K$ is the fundamental discriminant of $K$, the character $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$ is a primitive character of modulus $|\\Delta_K|$. Therefore, its conductor is:\n$$\nf(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = |\\Delta_K|\n$$\nCombining our results, we find the conductor of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = |\\Delta_K|\n$$\nThis provides the explicit expression for the conductor in terms of the discriminant.\n\nThe second part of the task is to prove that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{f(K/\\mathbb{Q})})$. Using our result for the conductor, this is equivalent to proving that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nFirst, we establish that the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is identical to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$.\nCase 1: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = d$. In this case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$ trivially.\nCase 2: $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$. The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = 4d$. The field generated by $\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{4d}) = \\mathbb{Q}(2\\sqrt{d})$. Since $2$ is a rational number, this field is the same as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$.\nIn all cases, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$. Thus, we need to prove that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nTo prove this inclusion, we use the theory of Gauss sums. Let $\\chi$ be a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $f(\\chi)$. The associated Gauss sum is defined as $\\tau(\\chi) = \\sum_{a=1}^{f(\\chi)} \\chi(a) \\zeta_{f(\\chi)}^a$. By its very definition, the Gauss sum $\\tau(\\chi)$ is an element of the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{f(\\chi)})$.\n\nWe consider the Gauss sum for our character $\\chi = \\chi_{\\Delta_K}$, which is primitive with conductor $f(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})=|\\Delta_K|$.\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = \\sum_{a=1}^{|\\Delta_K|} \\chi_{\\Delta_K}(a) \\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|}^a\n$$\nThis sum lies in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nA fundamental identity for the square of a Gauss sum associated with a primitive quadratic character $\\chi$ is:\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi)^2 = \\chi(-1) f(\\chi)\n$$\nApplying this to $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$, we get:\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})^2 = \\chi_{\\Delta_K}(-1) f(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{-1}\\right) |\\Delta_K|\n$$\nThe value of the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{-1}\\right)$ is $1$ if $\\Delta_K > 0$ and $-1$ if $\\Delta_K  0$. This is precisely the sign of $\\Delta_K$, denoted $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\Delta_K)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})^2 = \\mathrm{sgn}(\\Delta_K) |\\Delta_K| = \\Delta_K\n$$\nThis implies that $\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = \\pm\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$. Since $\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$, it follows that $\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$ must also be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$. This establishes that the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nAs we showed $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$ and determined that $f(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = |\\Delta_K|$, we have proven that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{f(K/\\mathbb{Q})})$.

Express $\\delta$ as a reduced fraction.\n\nWhat is the exact value of $\\delta$?", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is well-posed, scientifically grounded in established principles of algebraic number theory, and its premises are factually correct.\n\nThis problem consists of two parts. First, we determine the conditions under which a prime $p$ splits completely in the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{13})$. Second, we compute the natural density of such primes.\n\n**Part 1: Conditions for Complete Splitting**\n\nA rational prime $p$ splits completely in the biquadratic extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{13})$ if and only if it splits completely in both of the quadratic subfields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{13})$. The problem specifies that we consider primes $p$ such that $p \\nmid 65$, which means $p \\neq 5$ and $p \\neq 13$. This ensures that $p$ is unramified in both subfields.\n\nFor a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ being a square-free integer, a prime $p$ that does not divide $2d$ splits completely if and only if $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This condition is expressed using the Legendre symbol as $(\\frac{d}{p}) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, for a prime $p$ to split completely in $K$, we must satisfy the following two conditions simultaneously:\n1.  $p$ splits in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, which means $(\\frac{5}{p}) = 1$.\n2.  $p$ splits in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{13})$, which means $(\\frac{13}{p}) = 1$.\n\nWe now translate these Legendre symbol conditions into congruence conditions on $p$ using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. For distinct odd primes $p$ and $q$, this law states that $(\\frac{p}{q})(\\frac{q}{p}) = (-1)^{\\frac{(p-1)}{2}\\frac{(q-1)}{2}}$.\n\nFor the first condition, involving $q=5$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{(5-1)}{2}\\frac{(p-1)}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) (-1)^{2\\left(\\frac{p-1}{2}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) $$\nThus, the condition $(\\frac{5}{p}) = 1$ is equivalent to $(\\frac{p}{5}) = 1$. This means $p$ must be a quadratic residue modulo $5$. The non-zero residues modulo $5$ are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The quadratic residues are $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 4$.\nSo, $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ or $p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nFor the second condition, involving $q=13$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{13}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{13}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{(13-1)}{2}\\frac{(p-1)}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{13}\\right) (-1)^{6\\left(\\frac{p-1}{2}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{p}{13}\\right) $$\nThus, the condition $(\\frac{13}{p}) = 1$ is equivalent to $(\\frac{p}{13}) = 1$. This means $p$ must be a quadratic residue modulo $13$. There are $\\frac{13-1}{2} = 6$ quadratic residues modulo $13$. These are:\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$4^2 = 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$6^2 = 36 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\nSo, $p \\equiv 1, 3, 4, 9, 10,$ or $12 \\pmod{13}$.\n\nTo find the complete list of residue classes modulo $65$, we must solve the systems of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). We have $2$ choices for the residue modulo $5$ and $6$ choices for the residue modulo $13$, resulting in $2 \\times 6 = 12$ solutions modulo $5 \\times 13 = 65$.\nThe congruence systems are of the form:\n$p \\equiv a \\pmod{5}$, where $a \\in \\{1, 4\\}$.\n$p \\equiv b \\pmod{13}$, where $b \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$.\n\nSolving these $12$ systems gives the following set of residue classes modulo $65$:\nFor $a=1$: $\\{1, 16, 36, 51, 56, 61\\}$.\nFor $a=4$: $\\{4, 9, 14, 29, 49, 64\\}$.\nThe complete list of residue classes for $p$ modulo $65$ is $\\{1, 4, 9, 14, 16, 29, 36, 49, 51, 56, 61, 64\\}$.\n\n**Part 2: Natural Density**\n\nThe natural density $\\delta$ of a set of primes is the limiting proportion of primes that belong to that set. The set of primes that split completely in $K$ are precisely those whose residue modulo $65$ is in the set of $12$ values determined above.\nLet $S$ be the set of primes that split completely in $K$. Then,\n$$ S = \\bigcup_{a \\in \\{1, 4, \\dots, 64\\}} \\{ \\text{primes } p \\mid p \\equiv a \\pmod{65} \\} $$\nThe Prime Number Theorem for Arithmetic Progressions states that for a given modulus $m$, the primes are equidistributed among the $\\phi(m)$ residue classes $a \\pmod{m}$ with $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$. The density of primes in each such class is $\\frac{1}{\\phi(m)}$.\n\nFor our problem, the modulus is $m=65$. The Euler totient function is $\\phi(65) = \\phi(5 \\cdot 13) = \\phi(5) \\phi(13) = (5-1)(13-1) = 4 \\times 12 = 48$.\nThe $12$ residue classes we found are all coprime to $65$, since for any class $a$, $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$ and $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$.\nThe set $S$ is a disjoint union of $12$ sets of primes, where each set corresponds to an arithmetic progression with density $\\frac{1}{\\phi(65)} = \\frac{1}{48}$.\n\nThe total density $\\delta$ is the sum of the densities of these $12$ sets:\n$$ \\delta = 12 \\times \\frac{1}{\\phi(65)} = 12 \\times \\frac{1}{48} = \\frac{12}{48} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n\nThis result can be confirmed by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. For a Galois extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, the density of primes that split completely is $1/[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$. Here, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{13})$ is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})][\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}):\\mathbb{Q}]$. Since $\\sqrt{13} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, the degree of the first extension is $2$. The degree of the second is also $2$. Thus, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.

This group has $C_{16} \\times C_{25}$ as a quotient (by projecting away the $C_4$ factor), so a surjection exists.\n\nComparing the minimal candidates from both cases, we have $n=401$ and $n=1717$. The lesser of these is $n=401$. A rigorous check shows that no smaller composite number works. Any number $n401$ will fail to have $\\lambda(n)$ divisible by $400$. Therefore, the least positive integer is $n=401$.\n\nNow, we construct the abelian extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$. The Kronecker-Weber theorem states that any finite abelian extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a subfield of a cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ for some integer $m$. We are asked to use our minimal $n=401$.\nThe Galois group of the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is\n$$ \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/401\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} $$\nSince $401$ is a prime number, this group is cyclic of order $\\phi(401) = 400$.\n$$ \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_{400} $$\nThe target group is $G \\cong C_{16} \\times C_{25}$. Since $\\gcd(16, 25) = 1$, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem for groups, $G \\cong C_{16 \\times 25} \\cong C_{400}$.\nSo, $\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G$.\n\nWe must realize $G$ as a quotient of $\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q})$. Let $H = \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q})$. We need a surjective homomorphism $\\Phi: H \\to G$. Since $H \\cong G$ and these are finite groups, any isomorphism between them is a surjective homomorphism.\nThe field $L$ is the fixed field of the kernel of this homomorphism, $L = (\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401}))^{\\ker(\\Phi)}$.\nSince $\\Phi$ is an isomorphism, its kernel is the trivial subgroup, $\\ker(\\Phi) = \\{\\operatorname{id}\\}$.\nThe fixed field of the trivial subgroup is the entire field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})$. So, $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})$.\nThe Galois group of this extension is $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G$.\n\nTo explicitly describe the homomorphism, we choose a generator for $(\\mathbb{Z}/401\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The integer $3$ is a primitive root modulo $401$. We can verify this by checking that $3^{400/2} \\equiv 3^{200} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{401}$ and $3^{400/5} \\equiv 3^{80} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{401}$. Indeed, by quadratic reciprocity, $3^{200} \\equiv (\\frac{3}{401}) = (\\frac{401}{3})(-1)^{\\frac{2}{2}\\frac{400}{2}} = (\\frac{2}{3}) = -1 \\pmod{401}$. A calculation shows $3^{80} \\equiv 72 \\pmod{401}$. Thus, $3$ is a generator.\nThe canonical isomorphism $\\psi: (\\mathbb{Z}/401\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q})$ maps an integer $k$ to the automorphism $\\sigma_k$ defined by $\\sigma_k(\\zeta_{401}) = \\zeta_{401}^k$. So, a generator of the Galois group is $\\sigma_3$.\nLet $a$ be a generator for $C_{16}$ and $b$ be a generator for $C_{25}$. Then $(a,b)$ is a generator for $G \\cong C_{16} \\times C_{25}$.\nThe surjective homomorphism $\\Phi: \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to G$ is defined by its action on the generator:\n$$ \\Phi(\\sigma_3) = (a, b) $$\nThis mapping defines the isomorphism. The kernel is the trivial subgroup $\\{\\sigma_1\\} = \\{\\operatorname{id}\\}$, and the corresponding fixed field is $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{401})$.\nThe initial problem asks for the least positive integer $n$, which we have rigorously justified to be $401$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{401}$$", "id": "3027410"}]}
