For the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, Ostrowski's theorem provides a complete classification of all possible notions of \"size,\" or absolute values. This foundational exercise guides you through this classification, separating absolute values into the familiar archimedean (the usual absolute value) and the non-archimedean ($p$-adic) types. By applying these definitions to compute the product formula for a specific rational number, you will reinforce the crucial principle that global arithmetic information in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is elegantly encoded by its local behavior at all places, a central idea motivating the construction of the adele ring [@problem_id:3007172].", "problem": "Let $K=\\mathbb{Q}$ and let an absolute value on $K$ be a function $|\\cdot|: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ satisfying $|x|=0$ if and only if $x=0$, $|xy|=|x||y|$ for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, and $|x+y| \\le |x|+|y|$ for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.

We classify absolute values on $\\mathbb{Q}$ up to equivalence by analyzing the behavior on integers and by enforcing multiplicativity and the triangle inequality.\n\nFirst, we recall that an absolute value $|\\cdot|$ is archimedean precisely when the set $\\{|n| : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is unbounded. If $\\{|n|\\}$ is bounded, then the strong triangle inequality holds and the absolute value is non-archimedean. This can be derived by considering repeated addition: if $|1|\\le 1$, then $|n|=|1+\\cdots+1| \\le n|1|$ shows potential growth; if in fact the strong triangle inequality holds, then $|x+y|\\le \\max\\{|x|,|y|\\}$ forces boundedness on integers not divisible by a fixed prime.\n\nArchimedean case. Suppose $|\\cdot|$ is archimedean. Consider $|n|$ for integers $n\\ge 1$. By multiplicativity and monotonicity with respect to the usual order, the function $n \\mapsto \\ln |n|$ is additive on multiplication, hence linear in $\\ln n$. More precisely, the relation $|mn|=|m||n|$ implies $\\ln |mn| = \\ln |m| + \\ln |n|$, so the function $f(n) := \\ln |n|$ satisfies $f(mn)=f(m)+f(n)$ on $\\mathbb{N}$. On positive integers, such functions are of the form $f(n)=\\alpha \\ln n$ for some $\\alpha>0$ because $f$ factors through the unique real homomorphism from $(\\mathbb{R}_{>0},\\times)$ to $(\\mathbb{R},+)$ given by the natural logarithm. Therefore, for integers $n\\ge 1$,\n$$\n|n| = \\exp(f(n)) = \\exp(\\alpha \\ln n) = n^{\\alpha}.\n$$\nBy multiplicativity and the property $|1/n|=|n|^{-1}$, this extends to rationals: for $x=\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a,b\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $b\\neq 0$, we have\n$$\n|x| = \\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right| = \\frac{|a|}{|b|} = \\frac{|a|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha}}{|b|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha}} = \\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha},\n$$\nwhere $|\\cdot|_{\\infty}$ denotes the usual absolute value on $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus any archimedean absolute value on $\\mathbb{Q}$ is equivalent to the usual absolute value, and the equivalence class is represented by choosing $\\alpha=1$, i.e.,\n$$\n|x|_{\\infty} = \\begin{cases}\nx & \\text{if } x \\ge 0,\\\\\n-x & \\text{if } x<0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNon-archimedean case. Suppose $|\\cdot|$ is non-archimedean. Then for all integers $n$, we have $|n|\\le 1$ (since $|1+\\cdots+1|\\le \\max\\{|1|,\\ldots,|1|\\}=|1|$, and multiplicativity implies $|n| \\le |1|^n = |1|$; with $|1|=1$, this gives $|n|\\le 1$). Among primes $p$, choose one with minimal value $|p|<1$ if such exists; then for any integer $n$ not divisible by $p$, one has $|n|=1$ because otherwise $|n|\\le |p|$ would violate minimality. Using the strong triangle inequality and multiplicativity, one then shows that the absolute value is completely determined by the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization. Write any nonzero rational $x$ uniquely as $x = p^{k} \\frac{a}{b}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $a,b>0$, and $p \\nmid a$, $p \\nmid b$. Define the $p$-adic valuation $v_{p}(x):=k$. Then the non-archimedean absolute value satisfies\n$$\n|x| = c^{v_{p}(x)}\n$$\nfor some fixed $c \\in (0,1)$ with $c=|p|$. The classification now shows that every non-archimedean absolute value on $\\mathbb{Q}$ is equivalent to a $p$-adic absolute value attached to a unique prime $p$, given up to positive powers by the choice of $c$. For compatibility with the standard product formula on $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ in the theory of adeles and ideles, we fix the normalization\n$$\n|p|_{p} = p^{-1}.\n$$\nWith this normalization, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$,\n$$\n|x|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(x)}.\n$$\nHere $v_{p}(x)$ is the integer exponent of $p$ in $x$, defined by writing $x = p^{v_{p}(x)} \\frac{a}{b}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ coprime to $p$.\n\nSummary of explicit formulas. Up to equivalence, the absolute values on $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n- The unique archimedean place with\n$$\n|x|_{\\infty} = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \\ge 0, \\\\ -x & \\text{if } x<0, \\end{cases}\n$$\nand any other archimedean absolute value is $|x|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha>0$.\n- For each prime $p$, the $p$-adic place with\n$$\n|x|_{p} = p^{-v_{p}(x)},\n$$\nand any equivalent non-archimedean absolute value is $|x|_{p}^{\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha>0$.\n\nWe now evaluate the requested product for $x=-\\frac{36}{125}$. First factor $x$ into primes:\n$$\n- \\frac{36}{125} = - \\frac{2^{2} \\cdot 3^{2}}{5^{3}}.\n$$\nThus the $p$-adic valuations are $v_{2}(x)=2$, $v_{3}(x)=2$, $v_{5}(x)=-3$, and for all other primes $p$, $v_{p}(x)=0$. Using the normalized $p$-adic absolute values, the finite part of the product is\n$$\n\\prod_{p} |x|_{p} = |x|_{2} \\cdot |x|_{3} \\cdot |x|_{5} \\cdot \\prod_{p \\notin \\{2,3,5\\}} |x|_{p}\n= 2^{-v_{2}(x)} \\cdot 3^{-v_{3}(x)} \\cdot 5^{-v_{5}(x)} \\cdot \\prod_{p \\notin \\{2,3,5\\}} p^{-v_{p}(x)}.\n$$\nSince $v_{p}(x)=0$ for $p \\notin \\{2,3,5\\}$, those terms equal $1$. Hence\n$$\n\\prod_{p} |x|_{p} = 2^{-2} \\cdot 3^{-2} \\cdot 5^{-(-3)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot 125 = \\frac{125}{36}.\n$$\nThe infinite place contributes\n$$\n|x|_{\\infty} = \\left| -\\frac{36}{125} \\right| = \\frac{36}{125}.\n$$\nTherefore, the full product over all places $v$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is\n$$\n\\prod_{v} |x|_{v} = |x|_{\\infty} \\cdot \\prod_{p} |x|_{p} = \\frac{36}{125} \\cdot \\frac{125}{36} = 1.\n$$\nThis is consistent with the product formula for $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ under the standard normalizations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3007172"}, {"introduction": "Once we have identified all the completions of $\\mathbb{Q}$, the next step is to assemble them into a single, unified object: the ring of adeles $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$.

The topology on $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is the restricted product topology. A basis of open neighborhoods of $0$ for this topology is given by sets of the form $\\prod_{v} O_v$, where $O_v$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$ for each place $v$, and $O_p = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all but a finite set of primes $p$.\nConsider the set $V = (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}) \\times \\prod_{p} \\mathbb{Z}_p$. Here, the component at the infinite place, $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$, is an open neighborhood of $0$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. For all finite places $p$, the component is $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since the condition $O_p = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ holds for all but a finite number of primes (in this case, for all primes, so the finite set is empty), $V$ is a basic open set in the restricted product topology of $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. The zero adele $0=(0,(0)_p)$ is in $V$ because $0 \\in (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ and $0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all $p$. Furthermore, since $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}) \\subset [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, we have $V \\subset U$. Therefore, $U$ contains an open neighborhood of $0$, which makes $U$ a neighborhood of $0$.\n\nTo show that $U$ is compact, we consider its components.\n- At the infinite place, $U_\\infty = [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. By the Heine-Borel theorem, $U_\\infty$ is compact.\n- At each finite place $p$, $U_p = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the ring of $p$-adic integers. It is a standard theorem in number theory that $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a compact space. This is because $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a closed and totally bounded subset of the complete metric space $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nThe set $U$ is the Cartesian product of the compact spaces $U_v$ for all places $v$. According to Tychonoff's theorem (given as fact (iii)), the product of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact with respect to the product topology. Therefore, $U$ is compact in the product topology. The subspace topology that $U$ inherits from $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ (with its restricted product topology) coincides with the product topology on $U$ because $U_p = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all primes $p$. Thus, $U$ is a compact subset of $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\nSince $U$ is both a neighborhood of $0$ and a compact set, it is a compact neighborhood of $0$ in $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\n**2. Definition of the Haar Measure**\n\nAs $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is a Locally Compact Abelian group, it possesses a Haar measure, unique up to multiplication by a positive constant. The \"standard\" normalization for this measure, denoted $\\mu_{\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}}$, is defined via the local measures $\\mu_v$ on each completion $\\mathbb{Q}_v$. For a measurable set $E = \\prod_v E_v \\subset \\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ where each $E_v$ is measurable in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$ and $E_p = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ for almost all primes $p$, the measure is the product of the local measures:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{Q}}}(E) = \\prod_{v} \\mu_{v}(E_v).$$\nThe normalization of the local measures is specified in the problem statement as follows:\n-   At the infinite place $v=\\infty$, the measure $\\mu_\\infty$ on $\\mathbb{Q}_\\infty = \\mathbb{R}$ is the standard Lebesgue measure.\n-   At each finite place $p$, the measure $\\mu_p$ on $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is normalized so that the measure of the ring of $p$-adic integers is $1$, i.e., $\\mu_p(\\mathbb{Z}_p) = 1$.\n\n**3.

This set is of the form $\\prod_v E_v$, with $E_\\infty = [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$ and $E_p = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all primes $p$. Since the condition $E_p = \\mathbb{Z}_p$ holds for all primes, it holds for all but a finite number of them.
