It is a standard problem in algebraic number theory and is free of any scientific or logical flaws.\n\nThis problem consists of two parts. We will address them in order.\n\n### Part 1: The structure of the square class group $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times}/(\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}$\n\nAn arbitrary non-zero element $x$ in the field of $2$-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$, can be uniquely represented in the form $x = 2^{k}u$, where $k = v_{2}(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is the $2$-adic valuation of $x$, and $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$ is a $2$-adic unit. This gives a group isomorphism $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$.\n\nThe subgroup of squares, $(\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}$, consists of elements of the form $(2^{k}u)^{2} = 2^{2k}u^{2}$. For an element to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times}$, its valuation must be an even integer, and its unit part must be a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$. This gives the isomorphism $(\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times})^{2} \\cong 2\\mathbb{Z} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}$.\n\nThe square class group is the quotient group $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times}/(\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}$. Using the established isomorphisms, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times}}{(\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}}{2\\mathbb{Z} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}} \\cong \\left(\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{2\\mathbb{Z}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}}{(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe first factor, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, is a cyclic group of order $2$. Its elements correspond to the parity of the valuation, so its representatives can be taken as $2^{0}=1$ and $2^{1}=2$.\n\nNext, we must characterize the group of square units modulo squares, $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}/(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}$. For the prime $p=2$, the condition for a unit to be a square is more stringent than for odd primes. A unit $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$ if and only if $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nTo prove this, first suppose $u = x^{2}$ for some $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$. Since $x$ is a unit, it must be odd, so we can write $x = 2k+1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Then $x^{2} = (2k+1)^{2} = 4k^{2}+4k+1 = 4k(k+1)+1$. Since either $k$ or $k+1$ must be even, the product $k(k+1)$ is divisible by $2$. Therefore, $4k(k+1)$ is divisible by $8$, and we have $u = x^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nConversely, suppose $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. We can solve $x^{2}=u$ by constructing a solution iteratively, which is the essence of Hensel's Lemma. Let $x_{3}=1$. Then $x_{3}^{2} \\equiv 1 \\equiv u \\pmod{8}$. We can successively lift this to a solution modulo $2^{n}$ for all $n > 3$. If we have a solution $x_{n}$ such that $x_{n}^{2} \\equiv u \\pmod{2^{n}}$ for $n \\ge 3$, we seek $x_{n+1} = x_{n} + c \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ such that $x_{n+1}^{2} \\equiv u \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$. Squaring gives $x_{n+1}^{2} \\equiv x_{n}^{2} + c \\cdot 2^{n}x_{n} \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$ (since $2(n-1) \\ge n+1$ for $n \\ge 3$). By hypothesis, $x_{n}^{2} = u + d \\cdot 2^{n}$ for some $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$. We need to solve $u+d \\cdot 2^n+c \\cdot 2^n x_n \\equiv u \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$, which simplifies to $d+cx_{n} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. As $x_n$ is odd, this congruence has a unique solution for $c \\in \\{0,1\\}$, which is $c \\equiv d \\pmod 2$. This constructive process yields a Cauchy sequence whose limit is the desired square root of $u$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$.\n\nThe group of units of $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\cong \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. This is an abelian group of order $4$, isomorphic to $C_{2} \\times C_{2}$. The natural homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ has kernel $1+8\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Since every element in $1+8\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$, the kernel is a subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}$. Thus, the quotient group is\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}}{(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}} \\cong \\frac{(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}}{\\phi((\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times})^{2})} = \\frac{(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}}{\\{1\\}} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}.\n$$\nThis group has order $4$. Representatives for the distinct square classes of units can be taken as any integers congruent to $1, 3, 5, 7$ modulo $8$. A standard choice is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\nCombining the factors, the square class group $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times}/(\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{\\times})^{2}$ has order $2 \\times 4 = 8$. It is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, an elementary abelian $2$-group of rank $3$. A complete set of representatives is formed by taking products of representatives for the two factor groups. A standard set, using the smallest positive integers in each class, is:\n$$\n\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\} \\cup \\{2 \\cdot 1, 2 \\cdot 3, 2 \\cdot 5, 2 \\cdot 7\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14\\}.\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Isotropy of the quadratic form $q(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$\n\nA quadratic form is isotropic over a field if it has a non-trivial zero in that field. We need to determine if the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0$ has a solution $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{3}$ other than $(0,0,0)$.\n\nLet us assume such a non-trivial solution $(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ exists in $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{3}$. Let $k = \\min(v_{2}(x_{0}), v_{2}(y_{0}), v_{2}(z_{0}))$. We can define a new solution $(x,y,z) = (2^{-k}x_{0}, 2^{-k}y_{0}, 2^{-k}z_{0})$. This is also a non-trivial solution to the equation. Furthermore, all its components $x, y, z$ lie in the ring of $2$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, and at least one of them must be a unit (i.e., has valuation $0$). Such a solution is called a primitive solution. The existence of a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$ implies the existence of a primitive solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$.\n\nNow, let's test for the existence of a primitive solution $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{3}$ to $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0$. If this equality holds in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, it must also hold modulo any power of $2$. Let's consider the equation modulo $4$.\n\nAn element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is either a unit or a multiple of $2$.\n- If $a$ is a unit, $a=2k+1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Its square is $a^{2}=(2k+1)^{2}=4k^{2}+4k+1$, so $a^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $a$ is not a unit, $a=2k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Its square is $a^{2}=(2k)^{2}=4k^{2}$, so $a^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nThus, any square in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$.\n\nSince $(x,y,z)$ is a primitive solution, at least one of its components must be a unit. We examine the sum $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} \\pmod{4}$:\n\n1.  **Exactly one component is a unit.** Let $x$ be a unit, and $y,z$ be non-units. Then $x^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $y^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, $z^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n    The sum is $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} \\equiv 1+0+0 = 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n2.  **Exactly two components are units.** Let $x,y$ be units, and $z$ be a non-unit. Then $x^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $y^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $z^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n    The sum is $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} \\equiv 1+1+0 = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n3.  **All three components are units.** Then $x^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $y^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $z^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n    The sum is $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} \\equiv 1+1+1 = 3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nIn all cases where at least one component is a unit, the sum $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ cannot be congruent to $0 \\pmod{4}$. This contradicts the assumption that $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Therefore, no primitive solution can exist in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{3}$.\n\nSince the existence of a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$ necessitates the existence of a primitive solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, we conclude that the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0$ has no non-trivial solution over $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. The quadratic form $q(x,y,z)$ is anisotropic over $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$.\n\nAccording to the problem's answer specification, we should report $0$ if the form is anisotropic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3027904"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a single local field to the complete picture requires a tool that bridges all completions: the Hilbert symbol.

The final answer is the product of all these local symbols.\n\nThe places $v$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$ consist of the infinite place, denoted by $v=\\infty$, corresponding to the real field $\\mathbb{R}$, and the finite places, denoted by primes $p$, corresponding to the $p$-adic fields $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. The Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_v$ is defined to be $1$ if the equation $aX^2 + bY^2 = Z^2$ has a non-trivial solution in the local field $\\mathbb{Q}_v$, and $-1$ otherwise.\n\nWe proceed to calculate the symbols for each type of place.\n\n1.  **The Infinite Place, $v=\\infty$**:\n    The corresponding local field is $\\mathbb{Q}_\\infty = \\mathbb{R}$. The equation is $5X^2+29Y^2-Z^2=0$. The Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_\\infty$ is equal to $-1$ if and only if both $a$ and $b$ are negative. In this case, $a=5$ and $b=29$ are both positive. Therefore, a non-trivial real solution exists (for instance, $(X,Y,Z)=(1,0,\\sqrt{5})$).\n    $$ (5,29)_\\infty = 1 $$\n\n2.  **The Finite Places, $v=p$**:\n    A fundamental property of the Hilbert symbol is that for any non-zero $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the symbol $(a,b)_p = 1$ for almost all primes $p$. Specifically, $(a,b)_p=1$ if $p$ is an odd prime and $p$ does not divide the product $ab$. In our case, $a=5$ and $b=29$ are prime. The product is $ab=145$. Any odd prime $p$ other than $5$ and $29$ is unramified for this symbol.\n    $$ (5,29)_p = 1 \\quad \\text{for all primes } p \\notin \\{2, 5, 29\\} $$\n    We must now compute the symbols for the remaining \"ramified\" primes $p=2, 5, 29$.\n\n3.  **The Place $v=2$**:\n    For the prime $p=2$, both $a=5$ and $b=29$ are $2$-adic units (i.e., their $2$-adic valuation is $0$).

Since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the condition is satisfied, confirming that the symbol is $1$.\n\n4.  **The Place $v=5$**:\n    For an odd prime $p$, if $v_p(a)=1$ and $v_p(b)=0$, the Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_p$ is given by the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{b}{p})$.

We use the symmetry property of the Hilbert symbol, $(a,b)_p=(b,a)_p$.\n    $$ (5,29)_{29} = (29,5)_{29} $$\n    Now we are in a position to use the same formula as in the case $p=5$.

Therefore, by Hensel's lemma, there exists a unique root of $x^2-7=0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ which is congruent to $1$ modulo $3$. Let this root be $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nThen $(\\alpha, 1)$ is a solution to $x^2-5y^2=2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\subset \\mathbb{Q}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Q}_3$. Thus, $2$ is a local norm at $v=3$.\n\n- **Case $v=v_7$ (completion $K_{v_7}=\\mathbb{Q}_7$):**\nWe need to show that $x^2 - 5y^2 = 2$ has a solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_7$. Again, we seek a solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$ by first solving modulo $7$. The equation is $x^2-5y^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nIf we set $y_0=0$, the congruence becomes $x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. The quadratic residues modulo $7$ are $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2=9 \\equiv 2$. Thus, $x_0 = \\pm 3$ are solutions.\nLet's choose the initial solution $(x_0, y_0) = (3,0)$.\nLet $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. We have a solution $x_0=3$ to $h(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, since $h(3) = 9-2=7$.\nThe derivative is $h'(x)=2x$. At $x_0=3$, $h'(3)=6$.\nWe check the condition for Hensel's lemma with $p=7$.\n$|h(x_0)|_7 = |7|_7 = 7^{-1}$.\n$|h'(x_0)|_7 = |6|_7 = 1$.\nThe condition is $|h(x_0)|_7 < |h'(x_0)|_7^2$, i.e., $7^{-1} < 1^2$, which is true.\nBy Hensel's lemma, there exists a unique root of $x^2-2=0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$ which is congruent to $3$ modulo $7$. Let this root be $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7$.\nThen $(\\beta, 0)$ is a solution to $x^2-5y^2=2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_7 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_7$. Thus, $2$ is a local norm at $v=7$.\n\n**Part 2: Non-existence of a Global Norm**\n\nWe must show that $a=2$ is not a global norm from $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ to $K=\\mathbb{Q}$. This is equivalent to showing that the Diophantine equation $x^2-5y^2=2$ has no solution for $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSuppose a rational solution $(x,y)$ exists. We can write $x=X/Z$ and $y=Y/Z$ for integers $X,Y,Z$ with $Z \\neq 0$. By clearing the common denominator, we can search for an integer solution to the homogeneous equation $X^2-5Y^2=2Z^2$. If a non-trivial integer solution $(X,Y,Z) \\neq (0,0,0)$ exists, we can assume it is primitive, i.e., $\\gcd(X,Y,Z)=1$.\nConsider the equation modulo $5$:\n$X^2 - 5Y^2 \\equiv 2Z^2 \\pmod{5}$\n$X^2 \\equiv 2Z^2 \\pmod{5}$\nThe quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $1$ and $4$. The non-residues are $2$ and $3$.\nIf $Z \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, then $Z^2 \\equiv 1$ or $4 \\pmod{5}$.\n- If $Z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, then $X^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, which has no solution.\n- If $Z^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, then $X^2 \\equiv 2 \\cdot 4 = 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, which has no solution.\nTherefore, any integer solution must have $Z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nIf $Z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, then $X^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which implies $X \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nSince $X$ and $Z$ are divisible by $5$, let $X=5X'$ and $Z=5Z'$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$(5X')^2 - 5Y^2 = 2(5Z')^2$\n$25(X')^2 - 5Y^2 = 50(Z')^2$\nDividing the entire equation by $5$:\n$5(X')^2 - Y^2 = 10(Z')^2$\nConsidering this new equation modulo $5$:\n$-Y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which implies $Y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nSo, if $(X,Y,Z)$ is an integer solution, all three components $X,Y,Z$ must be divisible by $5$. This means that $(X/5, Y/5, Z/5)$ is also an integer solution.\nThis contradicts our assumption that $(X,Y,Z)$ was a primitive solution. If we start with any non-zero integer solution, we can repeatedly divide by $5$ to obtain an infinite sequence of smaller integer solutions, which is impossible by the method of infinite descent.\nThe only integer solution is the trivial one, $(X,Y,Z)=(0,0,0)$. This implies that there are no rational solutions to $x^2-5y^2=2$. Therefore, $a=2$ is not a global norm from $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Part 3: Obstructing Completion and Hilbert Symbol**\n\nThe Hasse norm theorem states that for a cyclic extension $L/K$, an element $a \\in K^{\\times}$ is a global norm if and only if it is a local norm at every place $v$ of $K$.\nWe have shown that $a=2$ is a local norm for $v \\in S=\\{\\infty, 3, 7\\}$ but is not a global norm. By the Hasse norm theorem, there must be at least one place $v \\notin S$ where $2$ fails to be a local norm.\nAn element $a \\in K_v^{\\times}$ is a norm from the quadratic extension $K_v(\\sqrt{d})$ if and only if the Hilbert symbol $(a,d)_v = 1$. In our case, $a=2$ and $d=5$. We are looking for a place $v$ where $(2,5)_v = -1$.\nThe Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_p$ for a finite prime $p$ is trivial (equal to $1$) unless $p$ divides $2ab$. For $(2,5)_p$, the only primes where the symbol might be non-trivial are $p=2$ and $p=5$.\nThe places in $S$ are $\\infty, 3, 7$. The obstructing place must be outside this set. Both $v_2$ and $v_5$ are candidates. Let's identify one such place and compute the symbol. We choose the place $v=v_5$, corresponding to the prime $p=5$.\n\nWe now compute the Hilbert symbol $(2,5)_5$. For an odd prime $p$, and integers $a, b$ not divisible by $p^2$, the formula is:\n$(a,b)_p = (-1)^{v_p(a)v_p(b) \\frac{p-1}{2}} \\left(\\frac{a/p^{v_p(a)}}{p}\\right)^{v_p(b)} \\left(\\frac{b/p^{v_p(b)}}{p}\\right)^{v_p(a)}$\nFor $(2,5)_5$, we have $p=5$, $a=2$, $b=5$.\nThe $5$-adic valuations are $v_5(2)=0$ and $v_5(5)=1$.\nThe non-$p$ parts are $a' = 2/5^0 = 2$ and $b' = 5/5^1 = 1$.\nSubstituting into the formula:\n$(2,5)_5 = (-1)^{0 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{4}{2}} \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{0} = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)$.\nThe Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)$ is $-1$, since the quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 4$. $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $5$.\nSo, $(2,5)_5 = -1$.\nThis confirms that $a=2$ is not a local norm at the completion $K_5=\\mathbb{Q}_5$. The place $v_5$ is indeed an obstructing completion, and it is not in the set $S$.\n\nThe obstructing completion is $v=v_5$, and the value of the Hilbert symbol $(2,5)_5$ is $-1$. (Note: $v=v_2$ is also an obstructing completion, with $(2,5)_2=-1$, satisfying the product formula $\\prod_v (2,5)_v = (2,5)_{\\infty}(2,5)_2(2,5)_5 \\dots = (1)(-1)(-1)(1)\\dots = 1$).\n\nThe question asks for the value of the Hilbert symbol at the identified obstructing completion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3027900"}]}
