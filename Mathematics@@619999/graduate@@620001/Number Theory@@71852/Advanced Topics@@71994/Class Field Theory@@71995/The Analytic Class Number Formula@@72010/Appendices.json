The function $\\phi$ is the pure tensor $\\phi=\\phi_{\\infty}\\otimes\\bigotimes_{p}\\phi_{p}$ with $\\phi_{\\infty}(x_{\\infty})=\\exp(-\\pi x_{\\infty}^{2})$ and $\\phi_{p}=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{p}}$.\n\n**Step 1: Euler Factorization and Computation of Local Integrals**\n\nFor a pure tensor function $\\phi = \\bigotimes_{v} \\phi_v$, the global zeta integral factors into a product of local zeta integrals over all places $v$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$\nZ(\\phi,s) = \\prod_{v} Z_{v}(\\phi_{v},s) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad Z_{v}(\\phi_{v},s)=\\int_{\\mathbb{Q}_{v}^{\\times}}\\phi_{v}(x_{v})\\,|x_{v}|_{v}^{s}\\,d^{\\times}x_{v}\n$$\nWe compute these local integrals for the archimedean place $v=\\infty$ and the finite places $v=p$.\n\nFor the archimedean place $v=\\infty$, $\\mathbb{Q}_\\infty = \\mathbb{R}$. We have $\\phi_{\\infty}(x_{\\infty})=\\exp(-\\pi x_{\\infty}^{2})$ and the measure is $d^{\\times}x_{\\infty} = dx_{\\infty}/|x_{\\infty}|_{\\infty}$. The absolute value is the standard one, $|x|_\\infty = |x|$.\n\\begin{align*}\nZ_{\\infty}(\\phi_{\\infty},s) &= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{\\times}} \\exp(-\\pi x_{\\infty}^{2}) |x_{\\infty}|^{s} \\frac{dx_{\\infty}}{|x_{\\infty}|} \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\pi x_{\\infty}^{2}) |x_{\\infty}|^{s-1} dx_{\\infty} \\\\\n&= 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\pi x^{2}) x^{s-1} dx\n\\end{align*}\nWe perform the substitution $u = \\pi x^{2}$, which implies $x = (u/\\pi)^{1/2}$ and $dx = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi u}}du$.\n\\begin{align*}\nZ_{\\infty}(\\phi_{\\infty},s) &= 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} \\left(\\frac{u}{\\pi}\\right)^{(s-1)/2} \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi u}} du \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\pi^{(s-1)/2}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} u^{(s-1)/2} u^{-1/2} du \\\\\n&= \\pi^{-s/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} u^{s/2 - 1} du \\\\\n&= \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\Gamma(z)$ is the gamma function. This is the archimedean factor of the completed Riemann zeta function.\n\nFor a finite place $v=p$, $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is the field of $p$-adic numbers. We have $\\phi_{p}(x_{p})=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{p}}(x_p)$, the characteristic function of the $p$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. The integral is over $\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times$. Since $\\phi_p$ is supported on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, the integral is restricted to $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We decompose this set into disjoint annuli: $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\setminus \\{0\\} = \\bigsqcup_{k=0}^{\\infty} p^k \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$.\n\\begin{align*}\nZ_{p}(\\phi_{p},s) &= \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_{p} \\setminus \\{0\\}} |x_{p}|_{p}^{s} d^{\\times}x_{p} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\int_{p^k \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times} |x_{p}|_{p}^{s} d^{\\times}x_{p}\n\\end{align*}\nFor any $x_p \\in p^k \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$, $|x_p|_p = p^{-k}$. The measure $d^\\times x_p$ is translation invariant on the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times$, so $\\int_{p^k \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times} d^{\\times}x_{p} = \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times} d^{\\times}x_{p}$. The problem states this measure is normalized so that $\\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times} d^{\\times}x_{p} = 1$.\nThus,\n$$\nZ_{p}(\\phi_{p},s) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (p^{-k})^{s} \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (p^{-s})^{k}\n$$\nThis is a geometric series which converges for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)>0$ (and specifically for our initial domain $\\operatorname{Re}(s)>1$) to:\n$$\nZ_{p}(\\phi_{p},s) = \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\n$$\nThis is the Euler $p$-factor of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nCombining all local factors, we obtain the global zeta integral:\n$$\nZ(\\phi,s) = Z_{\\infty}(\\phi_{\\infty},s) \\prod_{p} Z_{p}(\\phi_{p},s) = \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) \\prod_{p} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\n$$\nThe product over all primes is the definition of the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$. Therefore, for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)>1$,\n$$\nZ(\\phi,s) = \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) \\zeta(s)\n$$\nThis expression relates the Tate zeta integral for our choice of $\\phi$ to the completed Riemann zeta function.\n\n**Step 2: Meromorphic Continuation and Pole Structure**\n\nThe general theory of Tate's thesis, which relies fundamentally on the Poisson summation formula on the adele group $\\mathbb{A}$ with respect to the discrete subgroup $\\mathbb{Q}$, establishes the meromorphic continuation of $Z(\\phi,s)$ to the entire complex plane. The theory states that $Z(\\phi,s)$ is holomorphic everywhere except for simple poles at $s=0$ and $s=1$. The residues are given by:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} Z(\\phi, s) &= \\widehat{\\phi}(0) \\cdot \\tau(\\mathbb{G}_{m}) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Res}_{s=0} Z(\\phi, s) &= -\\phi(0) \\cdot \\tau(\\mathbb{G}_{m})\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\tau(\\mathbb{G}_{m}) = \\operatorname{vol}(\\mathbb{A}^{\\times,1}/\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)$ is the Tamagawa number of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to the measure induced by the chosen Haar measures. The problem postulates this fact as derived from Poisson summation.\n\nThe derivation of the problem's claim that the residue at $s=1$ is $\\tau(\\mathbb{G}_{m})\\cdot\\phi(0)$ requires showing $\\widehat{\\phi}(0) = \\phi(0)$. Let us verify this for the given $\\phi$.\nFirst, we compute $\\phi(0)$:\n$$\n\\phi(0) = \\phi_{\\infty}(0) \\prod_{p} \\phi_{p}(0) = \\exp(-\\pi \\cdot 0^2) \\prod_{p} \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{p}}(0) = 1 \\cdot \\prod_{p} 1 = 1\n$$\nNext, we compute the Fourier transform $\\widehat{\\phi} = \\bigotimes_v \\widehat{\\phi}_v$.\nFor $v=\\infty$, the Fourier transform of $\\phi_\\infty(x) = \\exp(-\\pi x^2)$ with respect to the character $\\psi_\\infty(y) = \\exp(2\\pi i y)$ is well-known to be itself:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\infty}(y) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\exp(-\\pi x^2) \\exp(2\\pi i xy) dx = \\exp(-\\pi y^2) = \\phi_{\\infty}(y)\n$$\nFor a finite place $v=p$, the Fourier transform of $\\phi_p = \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_p}$ is computed with respect to the self-dual measure $dx_p$ (for which $\\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} dx_p = 1$) and the character $\\psi_p$.\n$$\n\\widehat{\\phi}_{p}(y) = \\int_{\\mathbb{Q}_p} \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_p}(x) \\psi_p(xy) dx_p = \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\psi_p(xy) dx_p\n$$\nIf $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, then for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, the product $xy \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since $\\psi_p$ is unramified (trivial on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$), $\\psi_p(xy)=1$. The integral becomes $\\int_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} 1 \\, dx_p = 1 = \\phi_p(y)$.\nIf $y \\notin \\mathbb{Z}_p$, the map $x \\mapsto \\psi_p(xy)$ is a non-trivial character of the compact additive group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, so its integral is $0$. In this case, $\\phi_p(y) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_p}(y) = 0$.\nThus, $\\widehat{\\phi}_{p}(y) = \\phi_{p}(y)$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$.\nSince $\\widehat{\\phi}_v = \\phi_v$ for all places $v$, we have $\\widehat{\\phi} = \\phi$. Consequently, $\\widehat{\\phi}(0) = \\phi(0) = 1$.\nThe general residue formula for $s=1$ then becomes:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} Z(\\phi, s) = \\widehat{\\phi}(0) \\cdot \\tau(\\mathbb{G}_{m}) = \\phi(0) \\cdot \\tau(\\mathbb{G}_{m})\n$$\nas claimed in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 3: Determination of the Residue of the Riemann Zeta Function**\n\nNow we combine the results from the previous two steps.\nFrom Step 2, using the value $\\phi(0)=1$ and the given fact $\\tau(\\mathbb{G}_{m})=1$, we find the residue of the Tate integral:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} Z(\\phi, s) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nFrom Step 1, we have the expression $Z(\\phi,s) = \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma(s/2) \\zeta(s)$. We can compute the residue of this product at $s=1$. The function $\\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=1$, while the factor $f(s) = \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma(s/2)$ is analytic and non-zero at $s=1$. The residue of the product is therefore the value of the analytic part at $s=1$ multiplied by the residue of the pole part:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} Z(\\phi, s) &= \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\left( \\left(\\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)\\right) \\zeta(s) \\right) \\\\\n&= \\left(\\lim_{s\\to 1} \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\zeta(s)\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nWe evaluate the limit of the analytic factor:\n$$\n\\lim_{s\\to 1} \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) = \\pi^{-1/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the well-known value $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\pi^{-1/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\pi} = 1\n$$\nTherefore, we have\n$$\n\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} Z(\\phi, s) = 1 \\cdot \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\zeta(s) = \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\zeta(s)\n$$\nEquating our two computations for the residue of $Z(\\phi,s)$ at $s=1$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1} \\zeta(s) = 1\n$$\nThis concludes the derivation. The residue of the Riemann zeta function at $s=1$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3024644"}]}
