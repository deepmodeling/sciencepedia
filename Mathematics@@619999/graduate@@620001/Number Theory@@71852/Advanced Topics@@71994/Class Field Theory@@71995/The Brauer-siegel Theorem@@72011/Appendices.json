We may proceed with the solution.\n\n(a) We are tasked with determining the Dedekind zeta function $\\zeta_{K}(s)$ for the number field $K=\\mathbb{Q}$ and finding its residue at $s=1$.\n\nThe Dedekind zeta function of a number field $K$ is defined for $\\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$ as the Dirichlet series over the non-zero ideals of its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$:\n$$ \\zeta_{K}(s) = \\sum_{0 \\neq \\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_{K}} \\frac{1}{(N(\\mathfrak{a}))^s} $$\nwhere $N(\\mathfrak{a}) = |\\mathcal{O}_{K}/\\mathfrak{a}|$ is the norm of the ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$.\n\nFor the number field $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain (PID), every non-zero ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is of the form $(n) = n\\mathbb{Z}$ for some integer $n \\neq 0$. The ideals $(n)$ and $(-n)$ are identical, so we can uniquely represent each non-zero ideal by a positive integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. That is, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the non-zero ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}$ and the positive integers $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe norm of a non-zero principal ideal $(n)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is given by the cardinality of the quotient ring:\n$$ N((n)) = |\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}| = |n| $$\nSince we are using positive integers $n$ to represent the ideals, the norm is simply $N((n))=n$.\n\nSubstituting these findings into the definition of the Dedekind zeta function for $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, we get:\n$$ \\zeta_{\\mathbb{Q}}(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(N((n)))^s} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s} $$\nThis series is the definition of the classical Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$. Therefore, we have the identity $\\zeta_{\\mathbb{Q}}(s) = \\zeta(s)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the residue of $\\zeta_{K}(s)$ at the point $s=1$. This is equivalent to finding the residue of the Riemann zeta function at $s=1$. It is a fundamental result in the theory of the Riemann zeta function that $\\zeta(s)$ has an analytic continuation to the complex plane $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{1\\}$ and has a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$.\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1}\\zeta_{K}(s) = \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1}\\zeta_{\\mathbb{Q}}(s) = \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1}\\zeta(s) = 1 $$\n\n(b) We now determine the standard arithmetic invariants for $K=\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n$r_{1}$, $r_{2}$: An embedding of $\\mathbb{Q}$ into $\\mathbb{C}$ is an injective field homomorphism $\\sigma: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{C}$. Since any such homomorphism must map $1$ to $1$, it is the identity on the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, there is only one embedding, $\\sigma(x)=x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The image of this embedding is $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a subset of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, this is a real embedding. We have $r_1=1$ real embeddings. The number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings is $r_2$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = n = r_1+2r_2$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, we have $n=1$, so $1 = 1 + 2r_2$, which implies $r_2=0$.\n\n$D_{K}$: The discriminant of the number field $K$ is the discriminant of an integral basis for $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathcal{O}_{K}=\\mathbb{Z}$, and an integral basis is $\\{1\\}$. The discriminant is defined as $D_K = \\det( (\\sigma_i(b_j)) )^2$, where $\\{\\sigma_i\\}$ are the embeddings and $\\{b_j\\}$ is the integral basis. Here we have one embedding $\\sigma_1 = \\text{id}$ and one basis element $b_1=1$. The matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(\\sigma_1(b_1)) = (1)$. Thus, the discriminant is $D_{\\mathbb{Q}} = \\det((1))^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\n$h_{K}$: The class number $h_{K}$ is the order of the ideal class group of $K$. The ideal class group measures the extent to which a ring of integers fails to be a PID. As established in part (a), $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}} = \\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID. This means every ideal is principal, so the ideal class group is trivial. The order of the trivial group is $1$. Hence, the class number is $h_{\\mathbb{Q}} = 1$.\n\n$w_{K}$: The number $w_{K}$ is the count of the roots of unity contained in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, we seek the elements $\\zeta \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\zeta^m = 1$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$. The only such integers are $1$ and $-1$. Thus, the group of roots of unity in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{1, -1\\}$, and their number is $w_{\\mathbb{Q}}=2$.\n\n$R_{K}$: The regulator $R_{K}$ is related to the group of units $\\mathcal{O}_{K}^{\\times}$. By Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, the rank of the unit group is $r = r_1 + r_2 - 1$. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, the rank is $r = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0$. A rank of $0$ means the unit group is finite, consisting only of the roots of unity. Indeed, $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^{\\times} = \\mathbb{Z}^{\\times} = \\{1, -1\\}$. For a number field where the rank of the unit group is $0$, the regulator is defined by convention to be $R_{K}=1$. This corresponds to the determinant of a $0 \\times 0$ matrix.\n\n(c) We now verify that the result from part (a) is consistent with the analytic class number formula. The formula states that for a number field $K$, the residue of $\\zeta_{K}(s)$ at $s=1$ is given by:\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1}\\zeta_{K}(s) = \\frac{2^{r_1}(2\\pi)^{r_2}h_K R_K}{w_K \\sqrt{|D_K|}} $$\nWe substitute the invariants for $K=\\mathbb{Q}$ as determined in part (b):\n- $r_1=1$\n- $r_2=0$\n- $h_K=1$\n- $R_K=1$\n- $w_K=2$\n- $D_K=1$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula yields:\n$$ \\operatorname{Res}_{s=1}\\zeta_{\\mathbb{Q}}(s) = \\frac{2^{1}(2\\pi)^{0} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}{2 \\cdot \\sqrt{|1|}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 $$\nThis value of $1$ perfectly matches the value derived in part (a) by direct computation, $\\operatorname{Res}_{s=1}\\zeta_{\\mathbb{Q}}(s)=1$. This demonstrates that the case of $K=\\mathbb{Q}$ serves as a fundamental, confirming base case for the general analytic class number formula. The formula, which relates deep arithmetic invariants of a number field to the analytic behavior of its zeta function, holds true for this simplest number field.\nThe final answer requested is the value of this residue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3025182"}, {"introduction": "Having established the analytic class number formula in a base case, we now turn to the full power of the Brauer-Siegel theorem.

All required definitions, constants, and data are provided and are mutually consistent. The task is to numerically investigate the trend predicted by the Brauer-Siegel theorem for a specified set of imaginary quadratic fields.\n\nThe solution is constructed by implementing a step-by-step procedure for each given squarefree integer $d < 0$ in the test suite.\n\n**1. Discriminant Computation**\n\nThe first step is to compute the discriminant $D_K$ of the imaginary quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$. The rule, as stated, is based on the congruence of $d$ modulo $4$:\n- If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the discriminant is $D_K = d$.\n- If $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the discriminant is $D_K = 4d$.\nSince $d$ is squarefree, $d$ cannot be congruent to $0 \\pmod{4}$. This fundamental invariant $D_K$ is always congruent to $0$ or $1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n**2. Class Number Computation**\n\nThe most intensive part of the computation is determining the class number $h_K$. The problem mandates a calculation from first principles, specifically by counting the number of reduced primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms of discriminant $D_K$.\n\nA binary quadratic form, denoted as $[a,b,c]$, corresponds to the polynomial $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$. For this form to be relevant to our problem, it must satisfy a set of specific conditions:\n- **Discriminant**: The discriminant of the form must be $D_K$, i.e., $b^2 - 4ac = D_K$.\n- **Positive Definite**: Since $D_K < 0$, this is equivalent to requiring $a > 0$. Given $4ac = b^2 - D_K > 0$, if $a>0$, then $c$ must also be positive.\n- **Primitive**: The coefficients must be coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(a,b,c) = 1$.\n- **Reduced**: The form must satisfy the reduction conditions $|b| \\le a \\le c$. Additionally, if an equality holds, i.e., if $|b| = a$ or $a = c$, then it is required that $b \\ge 0$.\n\nThe value of $h_K$ is precisely the number of unique triples $[a,b,c]$ that satisfy all these conditions. To find this number, we develop an algorithm that enumerates these triples by leveraging constraints derived from the conditions themselves.\n\nFrom $|b| \\le a$ and $a \\le c$, we have $a^2 \\le c \\cdot a$. Thus, $4a^2 \\le 4ac = b^2 - D_K$.\nFrom the same condition, $b^2 \\le a^2$, so $4b^2 \\le 4a^2$.\nCombining these inequalities gives $3b^2 \\le b^2 - D_K$, which rearranges to $3b^2 \\le -D_K = |D_K|$. This provides a crucial search bound for the coefficient $b$:\n$$|b| \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{|D_K|}{3}}$$\nAdditionally, the discriminant equation $b^2 - 4ac = D_K$ implies that $b^2 \\equiv D_K \\pmod 4$. Since $D_K \\equiv 0$ or $1 \\pmod 4$, this means $b$ must have the same parity as $D_K$.\n\nThe algorithm for computing $h_K$ is as follows:\n1. Initialize a counter for $h_K$ to $0$.\n2. Iterate through integer values of $b$ from $0$ up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{|D_K|/3}\\rfloor$, ensuring $b$ has the same parity as $D_K$.\n3. For each value of $b$, calculate the product $ac = (b^2 - D_K)/4$. This quantity must be an integer.\n4. Iterate through possible integer values for $a$. The reduction conditions constrain $a$. Since $b \\ge 0$ in our loop, $|b| \\le a$ becomes $b \\le a$. The condition $a \\le c$ implies $a^2 \\le ac$, hence $a \\le \\sqrt{ac}$. Thus, we search for divisors $a$ of the product $ac$ within the range $[\\max(1, b), \\lfloor\\sqrt{ac}\\rfloor]$.\n5. For each such divisor $a$, we find $c = ac/a$. We now have a candidate triple $[a,b,c]$.\n6. We verify if the form is primitive by checking if $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$.\n7. If the form is primitive, we apply the counting rules based on the reduction conditions. Our search strategy considers only $b \\ge 0$:\n   - If the form is on the boundary of the fundamental domain, i.e., $b=0$, $b=a$, or $a=c$, it is counted once. The total count for $h_K$ is incremented by $1$.\n   - If the form is in the interior, i.e., $0 < b < a < c$, it represents a pair of reduced forms, $[a,b,c]$ and $[a,-b,c]$. The total count for $h_K$ is incremented by $2$.\n\n**3. Ratio Computation**\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio specified by the Brauer-Siegel theorem. For imaginary quadratic fields, the regulator $R_K$ is defined to be $1$. The ratio is:\n$$ L = \\frac{\\log(h_K R_K)}{\\log\\sqrt{|D_K|}} $$\nSubstituting $R_K=1$ and using the logarithm property $\\log(x^y) = y \\log(x)$, the expression simplifies:\n$$ L = \\frac{\\log(h_K)}{\\frac{1}{2}\\log|D_K|} = \\frac{2\\log(h_K)}{\\log|D_K|} $$\nThe logarithms used are natural logarithms (base $e$). In the special case where the class number $h_K=1$, the numerator $\\log(1)=0$, making the ratio $0$. The denominator is always non-zero, as $|D_K| \\ge 3$ for all imaginary quadratic fields.\n\nThe provided Python program implements this complete methodology.
