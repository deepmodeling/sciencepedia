Let $\\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. For a rational prime $p$, the law of decomposition of the ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ into prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is determined by the value of the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)$.\n\n(a) Justification of the classification of prime splitting.\n\nA prime $p$ is said to ramify in $K$ if and only if $p$ divides the discriminant of the field, which is $d$. The Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)$ is defined to be $0$ if and only if $p|d$. Specifically: for an odd prime $p$, $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=0$ iff $p|d$; for $p=2$, $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=0$ iff $d$ is even, which for a fundamental discriminant means $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ and thus $2|d$. Therefore, $p$ ramifies in $K$ if and only if $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=0$. This justifies the third case.\n\nTo analyze the unramified primes, where $p \\nmid d$ and $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, we use Dedekind's factorization theorem. This theorem relates the factorization of $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ to the factorization of the minimal polynomial of a generator $\\theta$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$, modulo $p$. We must consider two cases for the structure of $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nCase 1: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nIn this case, $d$ is a square-free integer. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ with $\\theta = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\theta$ is $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, Dedekind's theorem applies for all primes $p$. The factorization of $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ mirrors the factorization of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$.\n\n- Let $p$ be an odd prime. The discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $1^2 - 4(1)(\\frac{1-d}{4}) = d$. The factorization of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ depends on whether its discriminant $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$, $d$ is a nonzero square modulo $p$, so $f(x)$ has two distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Thus $f(x)$ factors into two distinct linear polynomials, and $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits into two distinct prime ideals: $p\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}\\,\\overline{\\mathfrak{p}}$ with $N\\mathfrak{p}=p$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=-1$, $d$ is a non-square modulo $p$, so $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Thus $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ remains prime (is inert), and $N(p\\mathcal{O}_K) = p^2$.\n\n- Let $p=2$. Since $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $d$ is odd, so $2 \\nmid d$ and $2$ is unramified. We examine $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$ modulo $2$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=1$, then by definition of the Kronecker symbol, $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. This implies $1-d$ is a multiple of $8$, so $\\frac{1-d}{4}$ is an even integer. Modulo $2$, $f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x \\equiv x(x-1) \\pmod 2$. The polynomial splits into two distinct linear factors. Thus, $2\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=-1$, then $d \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$. This implies $1-d = 1-(8k+5) = -4-8k$, so $\\frac{1-d}{4} = -1-2k$ is an odd integer. Modulo $2$, $f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x + 1 \\equiv x^2+x+1 \\pmod 2$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Thus, $2\\mathcal{O}_K$ is inert.\n\nCase 2: $d=4m$ with $m$ square-free and $m \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod 4$.\nThe ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ with $\\theta=\\sqrt{m}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\theta$ is $g(x)=x^2-m$.\n\n- Let $p$ be an odd prime. $p \\nmid d \\implies p \\nmid m$. The factorization of $g(x)=x^2-m$ modulo $p$ depends on whether $m$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, which is determined by the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)$. We relate this to the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4m}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^2}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)$.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$, then $\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)=1$. So $x^2-m$ has two distinct roots modulo $p$. Thus $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits.\n    - If $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=-1$, then $\\left(\\frac{m}{p}\\right)=-1$. So $x^2-m$ is irreducible modulo $p$. Thus $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ is inert.\n\n- For $p=2$, the discriminant $d=4m$ is even, so $2|d$. As established, this means $2$ ramifies and $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)=0$. To verify with Dedekind's theorem, we check $g(x)=x^2-m$ modulo $2$.\n    - If $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, $g(x) \\equiv x^2-2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$. It has a repeated root.\n    - If $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $g(x) \\equiv x^2-3 \\equiv x^2+1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$. It also has a repeated root.\n    In both cases, $2\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}^2$ for a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of norm $2$. This confirms that $2$ ramifies.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis demonstrates that for any prime $p$, the splitting behavior in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is correctly classified by the value of the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)$.\n\n(b) Density of splitting primes via Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nThe extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, as $K$ is a quadratic field. The Galois group is $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\{1, \\sigma\\}$, where $1$ is the identity automorphism and $\\sigma$ is the non-trivial automorphism defined by $\\sigma(\\sqrt{d})=-\\sqrt{d}$. The order of the group is $|G|=2$. Since $G$ is abelian, every element forms its own conjugacy class. The conjugacy classes are $C_1 = \\{1\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{\\sigma\\}$.\n\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem (CDT) states that for a given conjugacy class $C \\subseteq G$, the set of unramified primes $p$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$ whose Frobenius conjugacy class $\\mathrm{Frob}_p$ equals $C$ has a natural density of $\\frac{|C|}{|G|}$.\n\nWe need to identify which conjugacy class corresponds to the primes that split in $K$. A rational prime $p$ (unramified in $K$) splits in $K$ if and only if its residue degree $f$ is $1$. The Frobenius element $\\mathrm{Frob}_p$ is the element $\\phi \\in G$ that acts as the Frobenius automorphism on the residue field extension. Specifically, for a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ above $p$, $\\phi(x) \\equiv x^p \\pmod{\\mathfrak{P}}$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\n- If $p$ splits, the residue degree is $f_p=1$. This means the residue field $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{P}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_p$. For any element $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, we have $y^p=y$. So the condition becomes $\\phi(x) \\equiv x \\pmod{\\mathfrak{P}}$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. This implies that $\\phi$ is the identity element of the Galois group. Thus, for splitting primes, $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$.\n\n- If $p$ is inert, the residue degree is $f_p=2$. The residue field $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{P}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. The map $y \\mapsto y^p$ is the non-trivial Frobenius automorphism of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}/\\mathbb{F}_p$. This corresponds to the action of the non-identity element $\\sigma \\in G$. So, for inert primes, $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{\\sigma\\}$.\n\nFrom part (a), we know that a prime $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$ (for unramified primes). We have just shown that $p$ splits if and only if $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$. Therefore, the condition $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$ is equivalent to the condition $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$ for unramified primes.\n\nWe are seeking the natural density of primes $p$ for which $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$. This is the density of primes for which $\\mathrm{Frob}_p = \\{1\\}$. The relevant conjugacy class is $C = \\{1\\}$, with size $|C|=1$. The size of the Galois group is $|G|=2$.\n\nApplying the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density is:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{|\\{1\\}|}{|\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})|} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe set of ramified primes is finite (the prime factors of $d$), so its density is $0$. Thus, including them does not change the density calculation for the set of splitting primes.\nThe natural density of rational primes $p$ for which $\\left(\\frac{d}{p}\\right)=1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3025445"}, {"introduction": "A key strength of the Chebotarev Density Theorem lies in its ability to describe prime splitting even in non-Galois extensions.
