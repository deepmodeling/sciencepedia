All concepts used, such as cyclotomic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$, their Galois groups, the Kronecker-Weber theorem, and the notion of a conductor, are fundamental and rigorously defined in this field. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The integer $n$ is well-defined. The conditions for the subgroup $H$ are precise and consistent, defining a unique subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The concept of a fixed field $L$ is standard in Galois theory.

The setup is logically sound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in algebraic number theory. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the conductor $f(L)$ of the abelian extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$. By definition, $f(L)$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $L \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{m})$.\n\nLet $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)/\\mathbb{Q})$. The Kronecker-Weber theorem provides a canonical isomorphism $G \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The field $L$ is the fixed field of a subgroup $H \\leq G$, i.e., $L = (\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n))^H$.\n\nThe cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ is the fixed field of the subgroup $K_m = \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)/\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m))$ within $G$, assuming $m|n$. Under the isomorphism, this subgroup corresponds to the kernel of the natural projection map $\\pi_m: (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.\nThe condition $L \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ is equivalent by Galois theory to the subgroup inclusion $K_m \\leq H$.\nThe conductor $f(L)$ is thus the smallest $m$ such that $\\ker\\left((\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\right) \\leq H$. It is a standard result that the conductor of a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ must be a divisor of $n$. We therefore seek the smallest $m|n$ satisfying this condition.\n\nLet $n = 2^5 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^2 = 32 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 25$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), we have the following isomorphisms for the group and its subgroup:\n$$G \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/25\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$$\n$$H \\cong H_{32} \\times H_{27} \\times H_{25}$$\nwhere $H_{32}$, $H_{27}$, and $H_{25}$ are subgroups of the respective factor groups defined by the conditions on $a$.\n\nLet $m = d_1 d_2 d_3$ be a divisor of $n$, where $d_1|32$, $d_2|27$, and $d_3|25$. The kernel $K_m$ also decomposes:\n$$K_m \\cong \\ker(\\pi_{d_1}) \\times \\ker(\\pi_{d_2}) \\times \\ker(\\pi_{d_3})$$\nwhere $\\pi_{d_i}$ is the projection from the respective factor of $G$. The condition $K_m \\leq H$ is equivalent to three independent conditions:\n1. $\\ker\\left((\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/d_1\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\right) \\leq H_{32}$\n2. $\\ker\\left((\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\right) \\leq H_{27}$\n3. $\\ker\\left((\\mathbb{Z}/25\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/d_3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\right) \\leq H_{25}$\n\nTo find the minimum $m$, we must find the minimum $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ that satisfy these conditions. The conductor will be $f(L) = d_1 d_2 d_3$.\n\n**1. The $2$-adic component $d_1$:**\nLet $G_{32} = (\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The condition $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ defines the subgroup $H_{32}$:\n$$H_{32} = \\{ a \\in G_{32} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16} \\} = \\{1, 17\\}$$\nWe seek the smallest $d_1 = 2^j$ ($j \\in \\{0,2,3,4,5\\}$) such that $K(d_1) = \\ker(G_{32} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/d_1\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}) \\leq H_{32}$. Note that conductors which are powers of $2$ must be $1$ or at least $4$.\n- For $d_1=1$: $K(1) = G_{32}$, which is not a subgroup of $H_{32}$.\n- For $d_1=4$: $K(4) = \\{ a \\in G_{32} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4 \\} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29\\}$. Not a subgroup of $H_{32}$.\n- For $d_1=8$: $K(8) = \\{ a \\in G_{32} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8 \\} = \\{1, 9, 17, 25\\}$. Not a subgroup of $H_{32}$.\n- For $d_1=16$: $K(16) = \\{ a \\in G_{32} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16} \\} = \\{1, 17\\}$. This is exactly $H_{32}$, so the condition $K(16) \\leq H_{32}$ is satisfied.\nThe smallest value for $d_1$ is $16$.\n\n**2. The $3$-adic component $d_2$:**\nLet $G_{27} = (\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The condition $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$ defines the subgroup $H_{27}$:\n$$H_{27} = \\{ a \\in G_{27} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9 \\} = \\{1, 10, 19\\}$$\nWe seek the smallest $d_2 = 3^j$ ($j \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$) such that $K(d_2) = \\ker(G_{27} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}) \\leq H_{27}$.\n- For $d_2=1$: $K(1) = G_{27}$. Not a subgroup of $H_{27}$.\n- For $d_2=3$: $K(3) = \\{ a \\in G_{27} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3 \\}$. The order is $|G_{27}| / |(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}| = 18/2=9$. Since $|H_{27}|=3$, $K(3)$ cannot be a subgroup of $H_{27}$.\n- For $d_2=9$: $K(9) = \\{ a \\in G_{27} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9 \\}$. This is exactly $H_{27}$, so $K(9) \\leq H_{27}$ is satisfied.\nThe smallest value for $d_2$ is $9$.\n\n**3. The $5$-adic component $d_3$:**\nLet $G_{25} = (\\mathbb{Z}/25\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The third condition is that the image of $a$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a quadratic residue. The quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 4$. Let $\\pi_5: G_{25} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ be the reduction map.\n$$H_{25} = \\{ a \\in G_{25} \\mid \\pi_5(a) \\in \\{1, 4\\} \\}$$\nThis $H_{25}$ is the preimage of the index-$2$ subgroup $\\{1, 4\\}$ of $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, so $H_{25}$ is an index-$2$ subgroup of $G_{25}$. Its order is $|G_{25}|/2 = \\phi(25)/2 = 20/2 = 10$.\nWe seek the smallest $d_3 = 5^j$ ($j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$) such that $K(d_3) = \\ker(G_{25} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/d_3\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}) \\leq H_{25}$.\n- For $d_3=1$: $K(1) = G_{25}$. Not a subgroup of $H_{25}$.\n- For $d_3=5$: $K(5) = \\{ a \\in G_{25} \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5 \\}$. For any element $a \\in K(5)$, its image $\\pi_5(a)$ is $1$. Since $1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$, every element of $K(5)$ belongs to $H_{25}$. Thus, $K(5) \\leq H_{25}$ is satisfied.\nThe smallest value for $d_3$ is $5$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe minimal values for the components of the conductor are $d_1=16$, $d_2=9$, and $d_3=5$. The conductor $f(L)$ is the product of these components.\n$$f(L) = d_1 \\cdot d_2 \\cdot d_3 = 16 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 = 144 \\cdot 5 = 720$$\nThe conductor of the field $L$ is $720$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{720}\n$$", "id": "3010398"}, {"introduction": "A global conductor is determined by its local components, the conductor exponents at each prime.

The problem statement is objective and contains no ambiguities. It is self-contained and provides sufficient information for a rigorous derivation. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe conductor exponent $a(L/K)$ of the abelian extension $L/K$ is, by definition, the smallest non-negative integer $n$ such that the subgroup of principal units $U_{K}^{(n)}$ is contained in the norm group $N_{L/K}(L^{\\times})$.\n\nAccording to local class field theory, for any finite abelian extension $L/K$ of local fields, there exists a canonical surjective homomorphism, the local reciprocity map $\\theta_{L/K}: K^{\\times} \\to \\text{Gal}(L/K)$, whose kernel is precisely the norm group $N_{L/K}(L^{\\times})$. This yields the fundamental isomorphism $K^{\\times}/N_{L/K}(L^{\\times}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(L/K)$.\n\nTherefore, the condition $U_{K}^{(n)} \\subseteq N_{L/K}(L^{\\times})$ is equivalent to the condition that the image of $U_{K}^{(n)}$ under the reciprocity map is the trivial subgroup of the Galois group. That is, $a(L/K)$ is the smallest integer $n \\geq 0$ such that $\\theta_{L/K}(U_{K}^{(n)}) = \\{\\text{id}\\}$.\n\nThe specific extension is $L = \\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\\zeta_{p^{m}})$ over $K = \\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. This is a totally ramified cyclotomic extension. Its Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$, is canonically isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The isomorphism is given by mapping an automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ to the unique integer $j \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ such that $\\sigma(\\zeta_{p^{m}}) = \\zeta_{p^{m}}^{j}$. Let us denote this automorphism by $\\sigma_j$.\n\nThe action of the local reciprocity map for this extension is well-known.\n1.  For the uniformizer $p \\in K^{\\times}$: The reciprocity map sends a uniformizer to an automorphism that acts as the Frobenius on the maximal unramified subextension. Since $L/K$ is totally ramified, its maximal unramified subextension is $K$ itself. Thus, $\\theta_{L/K}(p)$ acts trivially, i.e., $\\theta_{L/K}(p) = \\text{id}$. This implies $p \\in N_{L/K}(L^{\\times})$.\n2.  For a unit $u \\in U_{K}^{(0)} = \\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\\times}$: The local reciprocity map $\\theta_{L/K}$ sends $u$ to the automorphism $\\sigma_{u^{-1}}$, where $u^{-1}$ is interpreted as an element of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ via the canonical projection $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. In other words, $\\theta_{L/K}(u)(\\zeta_{p^{m}}) = \\zeta_{p^{m}}^{u^{-1}}$.\n\nSince $\\theta_{L/K}(p)$ is already the identity, the condition $U_{K}^{(n)} \\subseteq N_{L/K}(L^{\\times})$ only imposes constraints on the units. We seek the smallest non-negative integer $n$ such that for every $u \\in U_{K}^{(n)}$, we have $\\theta_{L/K}(u) = \\text{id}$.\n\nThe condition $\\theta_{L/K}(u) = \\text{id}$ is equivalent to $\\sigma_{u^{-1}} = \\text{id}$. This requires the exponent $u^{-1}$ to be congruent to $1$ modulo $p^{m}$.\n$$u^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^{m}}$$\nThis congruence is equivalent to $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^{m}}$.\n\nThus, we are looking for the smallest integer $n \\geq 0$ such that every element $u$ of the group $U_{K}^{(n)}$ satisfies the congruence $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^{m}}$.\n\nThe filtration subgroup $U_{K}^{(n)}$ is defined as $U_{K}^{(n)} = 1 + p^{n}\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for $n \\geq 1$. An element $u \\in U_{K}^{(n)}$ is of the form $u = 1 + p^{n}k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.\nThe condition $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^{m}}$ implies that $u - 1$ must be divisible by $p^{m}$ in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.\n$$(1 + p^{n}k) - 1 = p^{n}k$$\nSo, we require $p^{n}k$ to be divisible by $p^{m}$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. In terms of the $p$-adic valuation $v_p$, this is $v_p(p^{n}k) \\geq m$.\n\nThis must hold for every $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Consider the element $k=1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. For this choice, we must have $v_p(p^{n} \\cdot 1) \\geq m$, which simplifies to $n \\geq m$. This shows that any potential value for the conductor exponent $n$ must be at least $m$.\n\nNow we must check if $n = m$ is sufficient. Let's consider the group $U_{K}^{(m)} = 1 + p^{m}\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. For any element $u \\in U_{K}^{(m)}$, we can write $u = 1 + p^{m}k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.\nThe difference $u-1 = p^{m}k$ is by definition divisible by $p^{m}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Therefore, $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^{m}}$ for all $u \\in U_{K}^{(m)}$.\n\nThis confirms that $U_{K}^{(m)}$ is a subset of the kernel of $\\theta_{L/K}$ restricted to units. Since $n \\geq m$ is a necessary condition and $n=m$ is a sufficient condition, the smallest such integer is $n=m$.\n\nTherefore, the conductor exponent is $a(L/K) = m$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{m}$$", "id": "3010429"}, {"introduction": "The conductor is deeply intertwined with the fine structure of ramification.

The largest is $1$. Thus, $s(\\chi)=1$.\nAs these characters are ramified, their Artin conductor exponent is $a(\\chi) = 1+s(\\chi) = 1+1=2$. There are $2$ such characters.\n\n- **Characters of order 9:**\nThere are $\\phi(9)=6$ such characters (the generators of $\\hat{G}$). Let $\\chi$ be one of them. The kernel is $\\ker(\\chi)=\\{1\\}$. We seek the largest integer $u \\geq 0$ such that $G^u \\not\\subseteq \\{1\\}$, i.e., $G^u \\neq \\{1\\}$.\nFor $u \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, $G^u=G \\neq \\{1\\}$.\nFor $u \\in \\{2, 3\\}$, $G^u=H \\neq \\{1\\}$.\nFor $u \\geq 4$, $G^u=\\{1\\}$.\nThe set of non-negative integers $u$ for which $\\chi$ is nontrivial on $G^u$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The largest is $3$. Thus, $s(\\chi)=3$.\nAs these characters are ramified, their Artin conductor exponent is $a(\\chi) = 1+s(\\chi) = 1+3=4$. There are $6$ such characters.\n\nIn summary, the Artin conductor exponents are:\n- $a(\\chi_0)=0$ ($1$ character).\n- $a(\\chi)=2$ for the $2$ characters of order $3$.\n- $a(\\chi)=4$ for the $6$ characters of order $9$.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Lower-Numbering Filtration and Discriminant Exponent**\n\nThe upper and lower numbering scales are related by the Herbrand function $u=\\varphi(i)$, where $\\varphi(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{dt}{[G_0:G_t]}$. The jumps in the lower filtration, say at $i_1, i_2, \\dots$, correspond to the jumps in the upper filtration at $u_1, u_2, \\dots$ via $u_k = \\varphi(i_k)$.\n\nLet the lower filtration be $G = G_0 = \\dots = G_{i_1} \\supset G_{i_1+1} = \\dots = G_{i_2} \\supset \\dots$. From the upper filtration, we know the sequence of subgroups is $G \\supset H \\supset \\{1\\}$. Thus:\n- $G_i = G$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq i_1$.\n- $G_i = H$ for $i_1+1 \\leq i \\leq i_2$.\n- $G_i = \\{1\\}$ for $i \\geq i_2+1$.\n\nFor $0 \\leq r \\leq i_1$, $G_t=G$, so $[G_0:G_t]=1$. The Herbrand function is $\\varphi(r) = \\int_0^r 1 \\, dt = r$.\nThe first upper break is at $u_1=1$. This corresponds to the lower break $i_1$, so $\\varphi(i_1)=1$. This gives $i_1=1$.\n\nFor $1 < r \\leq i_2$, we have $G_t=H$ for $t > 1$. The index $[G_0:G_t]=[G:H]=9/3=3$.\n$\\varphi(r) = \\varphi(1) + \\int_1^r \\frac{dt}{[G_0:G_t]} = 1 + \\int_1^r \\frac{1}{3} \\, dt = 1 + \\frac{r-1}{3}$.\nThe second upper break is at $u_2=3$. This corresponds to the lower break $i_2$, so $\\varphi(i_2)=3$.\n$3 = 1 + \\frac{i_2-1}{3} \\implies 2 = \\frac{i_2-1}{3} \\implies 6 = i_2-1 \\implies i_2=7$.\n\nThe lower-numbering ramification filtration is:\n- $G_i = G$ (order $9$) for $i=0, 1$.\n- $G_i = H$ (order $3$) for $i=2, \\dots, 7$.\n- $G_i = \\{1\\}$ (order $1$) for $i \\geq 8$.\n\nThe problem asks for $v_K(\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K})$, the exponent of the discriminant. For a totally ramified extension of local fields, this is given by:\n$$v_K(\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (\\lvert G_i \\rvert - 1)$$\nUsing our derived lower filtration:\n$v_K(\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{1} (\\lvert G \\rvert - 1) + \\sum_{i=2}^{7} (\\lvert H \\rvert - 1) + \\sum_{i=8}^{\\infty} (\\lvert \\{1\\} \\rvert - 1)$\n$v_K(\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K}) = 2 \\times (9 - 1) + 6 \\times (3 - 1) + 0$\n$v_K(\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K}) = 2 \\times 8 + 6 \\times 2 = 16 + 12 = 28$.\n\n**Task 3: Verification of the Conductor-Discriminant Formula**\n\nThe formula states that for an abelian extension, $\\sum_{\\chi \\in \\hat{G}} a(\\chi) = v_K(\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K})$.\nUsing the conductor exponents $a(\\chi)$ from Task 1:\n- $1$ character with $a(\\chi_0)=0$.\n- $2$ characters with $a(\\chi)=2$.\n- $6$ characters with $a(\\chi)=4$.\n\nThe sum is:\n$\\sum_{\\chi \\in \\hat{G}} a(\\chi) = 1 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 2 + 6 \\times 4 = 0 + 4 + 24 = 28$.\n\nThis value is identical to the discriminant exponent calculated in Task 2. The conductor-discriminant relation is therefore verified for this extension.\n\nThe problem requests the single integer value of $v_K(\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K})$, which we have calculated as the discriminant exponent.\nThe value is $28$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{28}\n$$", "id": "3010431"}]}
