We can seek a \"primitive\" solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_p^3$, which is a solution $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^3$ where not all of $x,y,z$ are divisible by $p$. The existence of a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is equivalent to the existence of a primitive solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. We work in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$, so $p=5$.\n\n1.  **Computation of $(2,5)_5$**\n    We analyze the equation $2x^2 + 5y^2 = z^2$ for a primitive solution $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5^3$.\n    Reducing the equation modulo $5$, we get:\n    $$2x^2 + 5y^2 \\equiv z^2 \\pmod{5}$$\n    $$2x^2 \\equiv z^2 \\pmod{5}$$\n    The quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 0^2\\} \\pmod{5}$, which are $\\{1, 4, 9\\equiv4, 16\\equiv1, 0\\}$, i.e., $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\n    If $x$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, its 5-adic valuation $v_5(x)$ is $0$, so $x \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. In this case, $x^2 \\equiv 1$ or $4 \\pmod{5}$.\n    - If $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, then $2x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n    - If $x^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, then $2x^2 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\n    In either case, $2x^2$ is congruent to $2$ or $3$ modulo $5$. The expression $z^2$ must be congruent to $0, 1,$ or $4$ modulo $5$. There is no value that satisfies $2x^2 \\equiv z^2 \\pmod{5}$ if $x \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n    Therefore, any solution must have $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n    If $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, the equation $2x^2 \\equiv z^2 \\pmod{5}$ becomes $0 \\equiv z^2 \\pmod{5}$, which implies $z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n    So, for any potential primitive solution $(x,y,z)$, we must have $v_5(x) \\ge 1$ and $v_5(z) \\ge 1$. Let $x=5x_1$ and $z=5z_1$ for some $x_1, z_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\n    Substituting these into the original equation:\n    $$2(5x_1)^2 + 5y^2 = (5z_1)^2$$\n    $$50x_1^2 + 5y^2 = 25z_1^2$$\n    Dividing by $5$:\n    $$10x_1^2 + y^2 = 5z_1^2$$\n    Reducing this new equation modulo $5$:\n    $$10x_1^2 + y^2 \\equiv 5z_1^2 \\pmod{5}$$\n    $$y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$$\n    This implies $y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $v_5(y) \\ge 1$.\n    We have shown that if $(x,y,z)$ is a solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_5^3$, then $x,y,z$ must all be divisible by $5$. This contradicts the assumption that $(x,y,z)$ is a primitive solution. This argument, by infinite descent, shows that the only solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_5^3$ is the trivial solution $(0,0,0)$.\n    Thus, there is no non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_5^3$.\n    $$(2,5)_5 = -1$$\n\n2.  **Computation of $(2,3)_5$**\n    We analyze the equation $2x^2 + 3y^2 = z^2$. Both $2$ and $3$ are units in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$. We look for a non-trivial solution. Let's try to find a solution with $z=1$. The equation becomes $2x^2 + 3y^2 = 1$.\n    Let's first find a solution modulo $5$: $2x^2 + 3y^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n    By trial, we can set $y_0 = 1$. The equation becomes $2x^2 + 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $2x^2 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. The squares modulo $5$ are $0, 1, 4$. $2(0)^2=0$, $2(1)^2=2$, $2(2)^2=8\\equiv3$, $2(3)^2=18\\equiv3$, $2(4)^2=32\\equiv2$. So we can take $x_0=2$.\n    Thus, $(x_0, y_0) = (2,1)$ is a solution to $2x^2 + 3y^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n    We now use Hensel's Lemma to lift this to a solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$. Let's fix $y=1$ and solve for $x$ in the equation $2x^2 + 3(1)^2 - 1^2 = 0$.\n    Let $f(x) = 2x^2 + 2$. We have a root $x_0 = 2$ modulo $5$, since $f(2) = 2(2^2) + 2 = 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n    The derivative is $f'(x) = 4x$. At $x_0=2$, we have $f'(2) = 4(2) = 8 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n    We check the condition for Hensel's Lemma: $|f(x_0)|_5 < |f'(x_0)|_5^2$.\n    $|f(2)|_5 = |10|_5 = |2 \\cdot 5|_5 = 5^{-1}$.\n    $|f'(2)|_5 = |8|_5 = 1$.\n    The condition is $5^{-1} < 1^2$, which is true.\n    Hensel's Lemma guarantees the existence of a unique root $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$ such that $f(\\alpha) = 0$ and $\\alpha \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n    This means there exists an $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$ such that $2\\alpha^2 + 2 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2\\alpha^2 + 3(1)^2 = 1^2$.\n    Thus, $(\\alpha, 1, 1)$ is a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_5^3$ to the equation $2x^2 + 3y^2 = z^2$.\n    $$(2,3)_5 = 1$$\n\n3.  **Computation of $(5,5)_5$**\n    We analyze the equation $5x^2 + 5y^2 = z^2$.\n    We can simplify this equation by noting that if $-1$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$, say $\\alpha^2=-1$, then we can set $y=1, z=0$. The equation becomes $5x^2+5(1)^2=0$, which implies $5x^2=-5$, so $x^2=-1$. A solution for $x$ would be $\\alpha$. Then $(\\alpha, 1, 0)$ would be a non-trivial solution.\n    We check if $-1$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$. For an odd prime $p$, a unit $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ if and only if the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{u \\pmod p}{p})$ is $1$.\n    For $p=5$, we check $\\left(\\frac{-1}{5}\\right)$. From number theory, $\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{(p-1)/2}$.\n    For $p=5$, this is $\\left(\\frac{-1}{5}\\right) = (-1)^{(5-1)/2} = (-1)^2 = 1$.\n    Since $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$ (e.g., $2^2=4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 5$), by Hensel's lemma there exists $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$ such that $\\alpha^2 = -1$.\n    Then setting $(x,y,z) = (\\alpha, 1, 0)$, we get $5\\alpha^2 + 5(1)^2 = 5(-1) + 5 = 0 = 0^2$. This is a valid non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_5^3$.\n    Alternatively, and more directly, one can search for an integer solution. Consider $(x,y) = (1,2)$:\n    $$5(1)^2 + 5(2)^2 = 5 + 5(4) = 25$$\n    We need this to be equal to $z^2$. Setting $z^2=25$ gives $z=5$.\n    Thus, $(x,y,z) = (1,2,5)$ is a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Z}^3$. Since $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}_5$, this is a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_5^3$.\n    $$(5,5)_5 = 1$$\n\n**Comparison with Heuristic Expectations from Legendre Symbols**\n\n- For $(2,5)_5 = -1$: The equation modulo $5$ is $2x^2 \\equiv z^2 \\pmod{5}$. A non-trivial solution requires $x,z \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$. This would imply $2 \\equiv (z/x)^2 \\pmod 5$, which would mean $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$. However, the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = -1$. The unsolvability of the congruence for non-zero $x,z$ is a strong indicator of the Hilbert symbol being $-1$.\n\n- For $(2,3)_5 = 1$: Since $2,3$ are units in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, a common heuristic is to check if $-3/2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$. This is equivalent to checking if its reduction modulo $5$ is a quadratic residue. $-3/2 \\equiv (-3)(3) = -9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$. The Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 1$. This correctly predicts that $(2,3)_5=1$.\n\n- For $(5,5)_5 = 1$: A similar heuristic suggests checking if $-5/5 = -1$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$. As calculated before, $\\left(\\frac{-1}{5}\\right) = 1$, so $-1$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$. This heuristic correctly predicts that $(5,5)_5=1$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe three Hilbert symbols are $(2,5)_5 = -1$, $(2,3)_5 = 1$, and $(5,5)_5 = 1$.

There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of scientific principles. The solution process may proceed.\n\nWe are asked to compute the Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_{v}$ for $a=13$ and $b=5$ for all places $v$ of the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, and then to compute their product. The places of $\\mathbb{Q}$ consist of the infinite place $v=\\infty$ (corresponding to the completion $\\mathbb{Q}_{\\infty} = \\mathbb{R}$) and the finite places $v=p$ for every prime number $p$ (corresponding to the completions $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$).\n\n**1. The Infinite Place ($v = \\infty$)**\nWe compute $(13, 5)_{\\infty}$. The field is the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. The equation is $13x^{2} + 5y^{2} = z^{2}$. Since $a=13$ and $b=5$ are both positive, we can easily find a non-trivial real solution. For instance, if we take $x=1$ and $y=0$, we get $13 = z^{2}$, which has a solution $z=\\sqrt{13} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $(x, y, z) = (1, 0, \\sqrt{13})$ is a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. According to the definition, this means $(13, 5)_{\\infty} = 1$. In general, for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\times}$, $(a,b)_{\\infty} = -1$ if and only if both $a < 0$ and $b < 0$. Since $13 > 0$ and $5 > 0$, the symbol is $1$.\n\n**2. The Finite Places ($v = p$)**\nWe now compute $(13, 5)_{p}$ for all prime numbers $p$. A fundamental property of the Hilbert symbol is that for any non-zero rational numbers $a$ and $b$, the symbol $(a,b)_{p} = 1$ for all but a finite number of primes $p$. Specifically, $(a,b)_{p}$ can be different from $1$ only for $p=\\infty$ and for the finite primes $p$ that divide $2ab$. In our case, $a=13$ and $b=5$, so $2ab = 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5 = 130$. The primes we must check are $p=2$, $p=5$, and $p=13$. For all other primes $p$, we have $(13, 5)_{p} = 1$.\n\n**Case $p=2$:**\nWe compute $(13, 5)_{2}$. We use the standard formula for the Hilbert symbol over $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. For $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\times}$ (i.e., odd integers), the formula is $(a,b)_{2} = (-1)^{\\epsilon(a)\\epsilon(b)}$, where $\\epsilon(x) = \\frac{x-1}{2}$.\nHere, $a=13$ and $b=5$.\n$\\epsilon(13) = \\frac{13-1}{2} = 6$.\n$\\epsilon(5) = \\frac{5-1}{2} = 2$.\nSo, $(13, 5)_{2} = (-1)^{6 \\cdot 2} = (-1)^{12} = 1$.\n\n**Case $p=5$:**\nWe compute $(13, 5)_{5}$. A general formula for the Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_{p}$ for an odd prime $p$ is given by\n$$ (a,b)_{p} = (-1)^{\\alpha\\beta\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\left(\\frac{u}{p}\\right)^{\\beta} \\left(\\frac{v}{p}\\right)^{\\alpha} $$\nwhere $a = p^{\\alpha}u$, $b = p^{\\beta}v$ with $u, v$ being $p$-adic units, and $(\\frac{\\cdot}{p})$ is the Legendre symbol.\nFor $a=13$ and $b=5$ and $p=5$:\n$a = 13 = 5^{0} \\cdot 13$, so $\\alpha = 0$ and $u=13$.\n$b = 5 = 5^{1} \\cdot 1$, so $\\beta = 1$ and $v=1$.\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$$ (13, 5)_{5} = (-1)^{0 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{5-1}{2}} \\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right)^{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{0} = \\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right) $$\nThe Legendre symbol is computed as $\\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{13 \\pmod 5}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$.\nThe quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $1^{2} \\equiv 1$ and $2^{2} \\equiv 4$.

The program must be self-contained and require no input.", "solution": "The problem of computing the Hilbert symbol $(a,b)_p$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}^\\times$ and a prime $p$ is a fundamental task in number theory. The Hilbert symbol is defined as\n$$\n(a,b)_p = \\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if the equation } z^2 = ax^2 + by^2 \\text{ has a non-trivial solution in } \\mathbb{Q}_p \\\\\n    -1 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nOur algorithmic approach is based on the properties of the symbol as specified, avoiding direct use of this definition. The core of the method is to use the bilinearity of the Hilbert symbol and reduce the computation to simpler cases involving $p$-adic units and the prime $p$ itself.\n\nFirst, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^\\times$, we can uniquely write it in the form $x = p^{v_p(x)} u$, where $v_p(x)$ is the $p$-adic valuation of $x$ and $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$ is a $p$-adic unit (a rational number whose numerator and denominator are not divisible by $p$). Let $a = p^{\\alpha} u$ and $b = p^{\\beta} v$, where $\\alpha = v_p(a)$, $\\beta = v_p(b)$, and $u, v$ are $p$-adic units.\n\nUsing the bilinearity and symmetry of the Hilbert symbol, we can expand $(a,b)_p$:\n$$\n(a,b)_p = (p^\\alpha u, p^\\beta v)_p = (p^\\alpha, p^\\beta v)_p (u, p^\\beta v)_p\n$$\n$$\n= (p^\\alpha, p^\\beta)_p (p^\\alpha, v)_p (u, p^\\beta)_p (u, v)_p\n$$\n$$\n= (p,p)_p^{\\alpha\\beta} (p,v)_p^{\\alpha} (u,p)_p^{\\beta} (u,v)_p\n$$\nSince the Hilbert symbol takes values in $\\{\\pm 1\\}$, all exponents can be considered modulo $2$. The computation then breaks down into evaluating the constituent symbols, which depends on whether $p$ is an odd prime or $p=2$.\n\n**Case 1: $p$ is an odd prime**\n\nFor an odd prime $p$, the values of the constituent symbols are given by standard formulas, whose justification relies on Hensel's lemma allowing us to lift solutions from the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\n1.  For any two $p$-adic units $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$, $(u,v)_p = 1$. This is because the quadratic form $z^2 - \\bar{u}x^2 - \\bar{v}y^2$ has a non-trivial zero in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ (by Chevalley-Warning theorem), which can be lifted to a non-trivial solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\n2.  For a unit $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$, $(p,u)_p = \\left(\\frac{u}{p}\\right)$, where $\\left(\\frac{\\cdot}{p}\\right)$ is the Legendre symbol. The value depends only on the residue class of $u$ modulo $p$, denoted $\\bar{u}$. Euler's criterion states $\\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{p}\\right) \\equiv \\bar{u}^{(p-1)/2} \\pmod p$.\n\n3.  The symbol $(p,p)_p$ can be related to another known symbol. We have the identity $(c, -c)_p = 1$ for any $c \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p^\\times$. Thus $(p, -p)_p = 1$. By bilinearity, $(p,p)_p (p,-1)_p = 1$, which implies $(p,p)_p = (p,-1)_p$. Using the previous rule, $(p,-1)_p = \\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right)$. It is a standard result that $\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{(p-1)/2}$.\n\nCombining these results, the formula for an odd prime $p$ becomes:\n$$\n(a,b)_p = \\left(\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right)\\right)^{\\alpha\\beta} \\left(\\left(\\frac{v}{p}\\right)\\right)^{\\alpha} \\left(\\left(\\frac{u}{p}\\right)\\right)^{\\beta} (1)\n$$\nwhere all exponents are effectively modulo $2$. Writing this with exponents in the argument of $(-1)$:\n$$\n(a,b)_p = (-1)^{\\alpha\\beta \\frac{p-1}{2}} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{p}\\right)^{\\beta} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{v}}{p}\\right)^{\\alpha}\n$$\nThe residues $\\bar{u}$ and $\\bar{v}$ of the rational units $u=u_n/u_d$ and $v=v_n/v_d$ are computed modulo $p$ as $\\bar{u} \\equiv u_n (u_d^{p-2}) \\pmod p$ and similarly for $v$.\n\n**Case 2: $p=2$**\n\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ requires a separate treatment, as Hensel's lemma requires lifting from residue rings $\\mathbb{Z}/2^k\\mathbb{Z}$ for $k>1$. The symbols depend on the residue classes of the units modulo $4$ or $8$.\n\n1.  For units $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2^\\times$: $(u,v)_2 = (-1)^{\\frac{u-1}{2}\\frac{v-1}{2}}$. This value is determined by the residue classes of $u, v$ modulo $4$. We define $\\epsilon(x) = \\frac{x-1}{2} \\pmod 2$. Then $(u,v)_2 = (-1)^{\\epsilon(u)\\epsilon(v)}$.\n\n2.  For a unit $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2^\\times$: $(2,u)_2 = (-1)^{\\frac{u^2-1}{8}}$. This value is determined by the residue class of $u$ modulo $8$. We define $\\omega(x) = \\frac{x^2-1}{8} \\pmod 2$. Then $(2,u)_2 = (-1)^{\\omega(u)}$.\n\n3.  The symbol $(2,2)_2 = 1$. This is because the equation $z^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2$ has an integer solution $(x,y,z)=(1,1,2)$, which is also a solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\nCombining these for $a=2^\\alpha u$ and $b=2^\\beta v$:\n$$\n(a,b)_2 = (2,2)_2^{\\alpha\\beta} (2,v)_2^{\\alpha} (2,u)_2^{\\beta} (u,v)_2\n$$\n$$\n= (1)^{\\alpha\\beta} ((-1)^{\\omega(v)})^{\\alpha} ((-1)^{\\omega(u)})^{\\beta} ((-1)^{\\epsilon(u)\\epsilon(v)})\n$$\nThis gives the final formula for $p=2$:\n$$\n(a,b)_2 = (-1)^{\\alpha \\cdot \\omega(v) + \\beta \\cdot \\omega(u) + \\epsilon(u)\\epsilon(v)}\n$$\nFor a rational unit $x=x_n/x_d$, its residue class modulo $k \\in \\{4,8\\}$ is given by $x_n \\cdot x_d^{-1} \\pmod k$. Since $x_d$ is odd, its inverse modulo $4$ or $8$ is $x_d$ itself, as $d^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ for any odd integer $d$. Thus, $x \\equiv x_n x_d \\pmod k$.\n\nThe implementation will follow these formulas, using exact rational arithmetic to correctly determine the valuations and unit parts.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import special\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef v_p_int(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        # According to the problem, inputs are in Q_p^x, so numerators and\n        # denominators of the original fractions are non-zero.\n        # This case won't be hit with valid inputs.\n        return float('inf')\n    \n    n_abs = abs(n)\n    if n_abs == 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    count = 0\n    while n_abs > 0 and n_abs % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n_abs //= p\n    return count\n\ndef v_p(frac, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of a rational number.\"\"\"\n    if frac == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    return v_p_int(frac.numerator, p) - v_p_int(frac.denominator, p)\n\ndef legendre_symbol(a, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Legendre symbol (a/p) using Euler's criterion.\"\"\"\n    if a % p == 0:\n        return 0\n    ls = pow(a, (p - 1) // 2, p)\n    if ls == p - 1:\n        return -1\n    return 1\n\ndef hilbert_symbol(a_frac, b_frac, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Hilbert symbol (a,b)_p.\"\"\"\n    alpha = v_p(a_frac, p)\n    beta = v_p(b_frac, p)\n\n    u = a_frac / Fraction(p)**alpha\n    v = b_frac / Fraction(p)**beta\n\n    if p != 2:\n        # Case p is an odd prime\n        u_mod_p = (u.numerator * pow(u.denominator, p - 2, p)) % p\n        v_mod_p = (v.numerator * pow(v.denominator, p - 2, p)) % p\n\n        term1 = pow(-1, (alpha * beta * (p - 1) // 2))\n        term2 = pow(legendre_symbol(u_mod_p, p), beta)\n        term3 = pow(legendre_symbol(v_mod_p, p), alpha)\n        \n        return int(term1 * term2 * term3)\n    else: # p == 2\n        \n        # Helper to get residue mod k for a 2-adic unit rational\n        def get_residue(frac, k):\n            # for a 2-adic unit x = n/d, x mod k is (n * d_inv) mod k.\n            # for k=4 or 8, d_inv is d itself since d^2=1 mod 8 for odd d.\n            return (frac.numerator * frac.denominator) % k\n        \n        u_mod4 = get_residue(u, 4)\n        v_mod4 = get_residue(v, 4)\n        u_mod8 = get_residue(u, 8)\n        v_mod8 = get_residue(v, 8)\n\n        # epsilon(x) = (x-1)/2 mod 2\n        eps_u = ((u_mod4 - 1) // 2) % 2\n        eps_v = ((v_mod4 - 1) // 2) % 2\n        \n        # omega(x) = (x^2-1)/8 mod 2\n        om_u = ((u_mod8**2 - 1) // 8) % 2\n        om_v = ((v_mod8**2 - 1) // 8) % 2\n        \n        exponent = (alpha * om_v + beta * om_u + eps_u * eps_v) % 2\n        \n        return 1 if exponent == 0 else -1\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run test cases and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # (p, a_num, a_den, b_num, b_den)\n        (3, 3, 1, 3, 1),      # Case 1\n        (5, 5, 1, 5, 1),      # Case 2\n        (7, 2, 1, 7, 1),      # Case 3\n        (7, 3, 1, 7, 1),      # Case 4\n        (3, 2, 1, 2, 1),      # Case 5\n        (2, -1, 1, -1, 1),    # Case 6\n        (2, 2, 1, 2, 1),      # Case 7\n        (2, -1, 1, 2, 1),     # Case 8\n        (2, 3, 1, 3, 1),      # Case 9\n        (5, 1, 5, 5, 1),      # Case 10\n        (3, 2, 3, 6, 1),      # Case 11\n        (2, 3, 5, 7, 9),      # Case 12\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for p, a_num, a_den, b_num, b_den in test_cases:\n        a = Fraction(a_num, a_den)\n        b = Fraction(b_num, b_den)\n        result = hilbert_symbol(a, b, p)\n        results.append(str(result))\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "3026921"}]}
