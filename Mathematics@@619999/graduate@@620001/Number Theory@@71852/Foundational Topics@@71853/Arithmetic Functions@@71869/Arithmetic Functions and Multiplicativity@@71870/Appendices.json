This function is commonly denoted as the divisor function, $\\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$.\n\n_2. Prove that $(1*1)(n)$ is multiplicative_\n\nTo prove that $h(n)=(1*1)(n)$ is multiplicative, we must show two conditions are met:\na) $h(1)=1$.\nb) $h(mn)=h(m)\\,h(n)$ for any two coprime integers $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (i.e., $\\gcd(m,n)=1$).\n\na) For $n=1$, the only positive divisor is $d=1$.\n$$(1*1)(1) = \\sum_{d\\mid 1} 1 = 1$$\nThe first condition is satisfied.\n\nb) Let $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be such that $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Let $h(n) = (1*1)(n)$.\n$h(m) = \\sum_{d_1 \\mid m} 1$ is the number of positive divisors of $m$.\n$h(n) = \\sum_{d_2 \\mid n} 1$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$.\n$h(mn) = \\sum_{d \\mid mn} 1$ is the number of positive divisors of $mn$.\n\nWe need to show that the number of divisors of $mn$ is the product of the number of divisors of $m$ and the number of divisors of $n$.\nLet $d$ be a positive divisor of $mn$. Since $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$, any divisor $d$ of $mn$ can be uniquely expressed as a product $d = d_1 d_2$, where $d_1$ is a divisor of $m$ and $d_2$ is a divisor of $n$.\n\nLet's establish this one-to-one correspondence.\n- Define a mapping $\\phi$ from the Cartesian product of the divisor sets of $m$ and $n$ to the divisor set of $mn$: $\\phi(d_1, d_2) = d_1 d_2$, where $d_1 \\mid m$ and $d_2 \\mid n$. If $d_1|m$ and $d_2|n$, then $d_1 d_2 | mn$, so the image of $\\phi$ is indeed a subset of the divisors of $mn$.\n- To show $\\phi$ is a bijection, we show it is both injective and surjective.\n- **Injectivity**: Suppose $\\phi(d_1, d_2) = \\phi(d'_1, d'_2)$, which means $d_1 d_2 = d'_1 d'_2$. Here, $d_1, d'_1$ are divisors of $m$, and $d_2, d'_2$ are divisors of $n$. Since $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, it follows that $\\gcd(d_1, d'_2)=1$. From $d_1 d_2 = d'_1 d'_2$, we have that $d_1$ divides $d'_1 d'_2$. Because $d_1$ and $d'_2$ are coprime, we must have $d_1 \\mid d'_1$. By a symmetrical argument ($d'_1 \\mid d_1 d_2$ and $\\gcd(d'_1, d_2)=1$), we get $d'_1 \\mid d_1$. Since these are positive integers, $d_1 = d'_1$. This implies $d_2 = d'_2$. Thus, the pair $(d_1, d_2)$ is unique, and the map is injective.\n- **Surjectivity**: Let $d$ be any divisor of $mn$. Define $d_1 = \\gcd(d, m)$ and $d_2 = \\gcd(d, n)$. Clearly $d_1 \\mid m$ and $d_2 \\mid n$. Since $\\gcd(m, n)=1$, a known property of the greatest common divisor states that $\\gcd(d, m) \\gcd(d, n) = \\gcd(d, mn)$. Since $d$ is a divisor of $mn$, $\\gcd(d, mn) = d$. Therefore, $d = d_1 d_2$. This shows that any divisor $d$ of $mn$ can be obtained from a pair $(d_1, d_2)$ where $d_1 \\mid m$ and $d_2 \\mid n$. The map is surjective.\n\nSince there is a bijection between the set of pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ (where $d_1|m, d_2|n$) and the set of divisors of $mn$, the number of elements in these sets must be equal. The number of such pairs is the product of the number of choices for $d_1$ and the number of choices for $d_2$.\n$$h(mn) = (\\text{number of divisors of } m) \\times (\\text{number of divisors of } n) = h(m)h(n)$$\nThis completes the proof that $h(n)=(1*1)(n)$ is multiplicative.\n\n_3. Evaluate $(1*1)(p^{k})$ for a prime $p$ and an integer $k\\geq 0$_\n\nLet $h(n) = (1*1)(n)$. We want to compute $h(p^k)$.\n$$h(p^k) = (1*1)(p^k) = \\sum_{d \\mid p^k} 1$$\nFor a prime number $p$, the positive divisors of $p^k$ (where $k \\ge 0$ is an integer) are precisely $p^0, p^1, p^2, \\dots, p^k$.\nThe set of divisors is $\\{p^0, p^1, \\dots, p^k\\}$. The number of elements in this set is $(k-0)+1 = k+1$.\nTherefore,\n$$(1*1)(p^k) = k+1$$\n\n_4.

Let $h(n) = (1*1)(n)$.\nIn part 2, we proved that $h(n)$ is a multiplicative function.\nLet $n_i = p_i^{\\alpha_i}$ for $i=1, \\dots, r$. Since the primes $p_i$ are distinct, the integers $n_i$ are pairwise coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(n_i, n_j) = 1$ for $i \\neq j$.\nApplying the multiplicative property of $h$ to the factorization of $n$:\n$$h(n) = h\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{r} p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\right) = h(p_1^{\\alpha_1} p_2^{\\alpha_2} \\cdots p_r^{\\alpha_r}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} h(p_i^{\\alpha_i})$$\nIn part 3, we found that $h(p^k) = k+1$. We can apply this result to each term $h(p_i^{\\alpha_i})$ in the product by setting $p=p_i$ and $k=\\alpha_i$:\n$$h(p_i^{\\alpha_i}) = \\alpha_i + 1$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $h(n)$:\n$$(1*1)(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (\\alpha_i + 1)$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $(1*1)(n)$ in terms of the exponents $\\alpha_i$ from its prime factorization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} (\\alpha_{i} + 1)}$$", "id": "3008283"}, {"introduction": "Having explored convolution, we now turn to the algebraic structure it defines.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Inverse Function\nWe are tasked with finding the arithmetic function $g$ such that $(g * \\operatorname{id})(n) = \\delta(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The function $\\operatorname{id}(n)=n$ is completely multiplicative, and thus multiplicative. Since the set of multiplicative functions forms a subgroup of the group of invertible arithmetic functions, the inverse $g$ of $\\operatorname{id}$ must also be multiplicative.\n\nA multiplicative function is uniquely determined by its values on prime powers. Let's determine $g(p^k)$ for a prime $p$ and integer $k \\ge 0$. The convolution equation is:\n$$ (g * \\operatorname{id})(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} g(d) \\operatorname{id}\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) = \\delta(n) $$\nFor $n=p^k$, the divisors are $1, p, p^2, \\dots, p^k$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{k} g(p^j) \\operatorname{id}(p^{k-j}) = \\delta(p^k) $$\nSubstituting $\\operatorname{id}(m)=m$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{k} g(p^j) p^{k-j} = \\delta(p^k) $$\n\nWe solve this recursively for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n-   For $k=0$ (i.e., $n=1$):\n    $g(p^0)p^0 = \\delta(1) \\implies g(1) \\cdot 1 = 1 \\implies g(1) = 1$.\n\n-   For $k=1$ (i.e., $n=p$):\n    $g(1)p^1 + g(p)p^0 = \\delta(p) \\implies 1 \\cdot p + g(p) \\cdot 1 = 0 \\implies g(p) = -p$.\n\n-   For $k=2$ (i.e., $n=p^2$):\n    $g(1)p^2 + g(p)p^1 + g(p^2)p^0 = \\delta(p^2) \\implies 1 \\cdot p^2 + (-p) \\cdot p + g(p^2) \\cdot 1 = 0$.\n    $p^2 - p^2 + g(p^2) = 0 \\implies g(p^2) = 0$.\n\n-   For $k \\ge 2$:\n    We hypothesize that $g(p^k) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$. We have shown the base case $k=2$. Let's assume $g(p^j)=0$ for all $2 \\le j < k$. The convolution equation for $n=p^k$ is:\n    $$ \\sum_{j=0}^{k} g(p^j) p^{k-j} = 0 $$\n    Isolating the $j=k$ term:\n    $$ g(p^k) = - \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} g(p^j) p^{k-j} $$\n    $$ g(p^k) = - \\left( g(1)p^k + g(p)p^{k-1} + \\sum_{j=2}^{k-1} g(p^j)p^{k-j} \\right) $$\n    By the induction hypothesis, $g(p^j)=0$ for $2 \\le j \\le k-1$, so the sum is zero.\n    $$ g(p^k) = - (1 \\cdot p^k + (-p) \\cdot p^{k-1}) = - (p^k - p^k) = 0 $$\n    The induction holds. Thus, $g(p^k) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\n\nNow, we construct $g(n)$ for any integer $n \\ge 1$ using its prime factorization $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_r^{a_r}$. Since $g$ is multiplicative:\n$$ g(n) = g(p_1^{a_1}) g(p_2^{a_2}) \\dots g(p_r^{a_r}) $$\nFrom our findings:\n-   If any exponent $a_i \\ge 2$, then $n$ is not square-free. The product for $g(n)$ will contain the factor $g(p_i^{a_i}) = 0$, so $g(n)=0$.\n-   If all exponents $a_i=1$, then $n=p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ is a square-free number with $r$ distinct prime factors. Let $\\omega(n)=r$ be the number of distinct prime factors of $n$.\n    $$ g(n) = g(p_1) g(p_2) \\dots g(p_r) = (-p_1)(-p_2)\\dots(-p_r) = (-1)^r p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r = (-1)^{\\omega(n)} n $$\n-   If $n=1$, $g(1)=1$.\n\nThis definition coincides precisely with the function $\\mu(n)n$, where $\\mu$ is the MÃ¶bius function. The MÃ¶bius function is defined as $\\mu(1)=1$, $\\mu(n)=(-1)^{\\omega(n)}$ if $n$ is square-free and $n>1$, and $\\mu(n)=0$ if $n$ is not square-free.\nTherefore, the Dirichlet inverse of $\\operatorname{id}$ is $g(n) = \\mu(n)n$.\n\n### Confirmation with Dirichlet Generating Functions\nWe confirm this result by showing that $D_g(s) D_{\\operatorname{id}}(s) = 1$. The property $D_{f*h}(s)=D_f(s)D_h(s)$ implies that if $g$ is the inverse of $\\operatorname{id}$, then $D_g(s)D_{\\operatorname{id}}(s) = D_{g*\\operatorname{id}}(s) = D_\\delta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\delta(n)}{n^s} = \\frac{1}{1^s}=1$.\n\nWe leverage the multiplicativity of the functions to express their DGFs as Euler products. The DGF of a multiplicative function $f$ is given by $D_f(s) = \\prod_p \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{f(p^k)}{(p^k)^s} \\right)$.\n\n-   For $\\operatorname{id}(n)=n$: This function is completely multiplicative, i.e., $\\operatorname{id}(p^k) = (\\operatorname{id}(p))^k = p^k$.\n    $$ D_{\\operatorname{id}}(s) = \\prod_p \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{p^k}{p^{ks}} \\right) = \\prod_p \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (p^{1-s})^k \\right) $$\n    This is a geometric series which converges for $|p^{1-s}|<1$, i.e., $\\operatorname{Re}(s)>1$. The sum is $(1-p^{1-s})^{-1}$.\n    $$ D_{\\operatorname{id}}(s) = \\prod_p (1-p^{1-s})^{-1} $$\n    Comparing with the given Euler product for the zeta function, $\\zeta(z) = \\prod_p (1-p^{-z})^{-1}$, we see that $D_{\\operatorname{id}}(s) = \\zeta(s-1)$. This series converges for $\\operatorname{Re}(s-1)>1$, or $\\operatorname{Re}(s)>2$.\n\n-   For $g(n)=\\mu(n)n$: This function is multiplicative. We found its values on prime powers to be $g(1)=1$, $g(p)=-p$, and $g(p^k)=0$ for $k\\ge 2$.\n    $$ D_g(s) = \\prod_p \\left( \\frac{g(1)}{1^s} + \\frac{g(p)}{p^s} + \\frac{g(p^2)}{p^{2s}} + \\dots \\right) = \\prod_p \\left( 1 + \\frac{-p}{p^s} + 0 + \\dots \\right) $$\n    $$ D_g(s) = \\prod_p (1 - p^{1-s}) $$\n\nNow, we compute the product of the two DGFs:\n$$ D_g(s) D_{\\operatorname{id}}(s) = \\left( \\prod_p (1 - p^{1-s}) \\right) \\left( \\prod_p (1-p^{1-s})^{-1} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\prod_p \\left( (1 - p^{1-s}) (1-p^{1-s})^{-1} \\right) = \\prod_p (1) = 1 $$\nThis holds for $\\operatorname{Re}(s)>2$. Since the product of the DGFs is $1$, this confirms that $g(n) = \\mu(n)n$ is indeed the Dirichlet convolution inverse of $\\operatorname{id}(n)$.\n\nThe final closed-form expression for $g(n)$ is $\\mu(n)n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mu(n)n}$$", "id": "3029193"}, {"introduction": "We now connect the algebraic world of arithmetic functions to the analytic realm through Dirichlet generating functions (DGFs).
