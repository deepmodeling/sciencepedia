These are clearly different. The reason stems from the algebraic properties of the mapping from arithmetic functions to DGFs. This mapping, let's call it $\\mathcal{D}$, transforms the ring of arithmetic functions $(\\mathcal{A}, +, *)$ into the ring of formal Dirichlet series $(\\mathcal{S}, +, \\times)$, where $+$ is pointwise addition of functions and series addition, $*$ is Dirichlet convolution, and $\\times$ is formal series multiplication.

Its DGF is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(n)g(n)}{n^s}$, an expression that, in general, cannot be expressed as a simple combination of $F(s)$ and $G(s)$. The two operations, convolution and pointwise product, are fundamentally different algebraic structures on the set of arithmetic functions, and this difference is reflected in their distinct representations in the domain of generating functions.\n\n4.  **Computation of $(f*g)(60) - (f \\cdot g)(60)$**\n\n_This task requires a numerical calculation based on the closed-form expressions derived in the first two parts._\n\nFrom part 1, we have $(f*g)(n) = \\sigma(n)$.\nFrom part 2, we have $(f \\cdot g)(n) = n$.\nWe need to compute the value of $\\sigma(60) - 60$.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $60$:\n$$60 = 6 \\times 10 = (2 \\times 3) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$$\nThe sum-of-divisors function $\\sigma(n)$ is a multiplicative function.

This definition implies $f(1) = f(p^0) = 0+1 = 1$, which is consistent with the property that $f(1)=1$ for any non-zero multiplicative function. Our goal is to compute the Bell series and Dirichlet generating function for $f$, and to identify $f$ in terms of a standard arithmetic function.\n\nFirst, we compute the Bell series of $f$ at a prime $p$, which is defined as $B_{p}(f;X)=\\sum_{k\\geq 0} f(p^{k})X^{k}$.\nSubstituting the given expression for $f(p^k)$, we have:\n$$B_{p}(f;X) = \\sum_{k\\geq 0} (k+1)X^{k}$$\nThis is a standard formal power series.
