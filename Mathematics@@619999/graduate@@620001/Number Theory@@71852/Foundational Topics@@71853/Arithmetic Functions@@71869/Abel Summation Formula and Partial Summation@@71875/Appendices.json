It is scientifically grounded in established principles of analytic number theory, specifically concerning the divisor problem and the application of partial summation. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary definitions and conditions provided for a unique solution to be derived. It is objective and its terms are formally defined. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe objective is to find an explicit analytic expression for the sum $S(x) \\coloneqq \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\frac{d(n)}{n}$, where $d(n)$ is the divisor function. The primary tool for this derivation, as stipulated, is the method of partial summation, which we must derive from first principles.\n\nLet $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be a sequence of complex numbers, and let $f(t)$ be a continuously differentiable function on $[1, \\infty)$. We define the partial sum function $A(x) \\coloneqq \\sum_{1 \\leq n \\leq x} a_n$. Our goal is to evaluate the sum $\\sum_{1 \\leq n \\leq x} a_n f(n)$.\n\nLet $N \\coloneqq \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ be the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. The sum can be written as $\\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n f(n)$.\nWe can express $a_n$ in terms of the partial sum function $A(n)$: for $n > 1$, $a_n = A(n) - A(n-1)$, and $a_1 = A(1)$. We also define $A(0) = 0$.\nSubstituting this into the sum:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n f(n) = A(1) f(1) + \\sum_{n=2}^{N} (A(n) - A(n-1)) f(n) $$\n$$ = A(1) f(1) + \\sum_{n=2}^{N} A(n) f(n) - \\sum_{n=2}^{N} A(n-1) f(n) $$\nCombining the first two terms and re-indexing the second sum (letting $k = n-1$):\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n f(n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} A(n) f(n) - \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} A(k) f(k+1) $$\nSeparating the term for $n=N$ from the first sum:\n$$ = A(N) f(N) + \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} A(n) f(n) - \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} A(n) f(n+1) $$\n$$ = A(N) f(N) - \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} A(n) (f(n+1) - f(n)) $$\nSince $f$ is continuously differentiable, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus implies $f(n+1) - f(n) = \\int_{n}^{n+1} f'(t) \\, dt$.
