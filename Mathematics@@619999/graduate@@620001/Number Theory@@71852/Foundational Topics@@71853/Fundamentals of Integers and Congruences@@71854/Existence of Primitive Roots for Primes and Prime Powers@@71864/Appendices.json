All provided definitions and conditions are standard and free of contradiction or ambiguity. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the multiplicative order of the element $2$ in the group of units modulo $29$, denoted $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/29\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$. The prime is $p=29$. The order of this group is given by Euler's totient function, $\\varphi(p)$, which for a prime $p$ is $\\varphi(p) = p-1$. Thus, the order of the group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/29\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ is $\\varphi(29) = 29-1 = 28$.\n\nLet the multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $29$ be denoted by $k$. By definition, $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that $2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$. A fundamental property of finite groups, explicitly cited as a core fact in the problem, is that the order of any element must divide the order of the group. Therefore, $k$ must be a divisor of $28$.\n\nFirst, we identify all positive divisors of $28$. The integer $28$ can be factored into its prime components as $28 = 2^2 \\times 7^1$. The divisors are therefore found to be $\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\\}$. To find the order $k$, which is the *least* such positive integer, we must test the proper divisors of $28$ in ascending order. If $2^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$ for some proper divisor $d$, then $k$ would be that smallest such $d$. If $2^d \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$ for all proper divisors $d$, then the order $k$ must be $28$ itself, as it is the only remaining possibility.\n\nThe set of proper divisors of $28$ is $\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 14\\}$. We now perform the modular exponentiation for each of these divisors.\n\n1.  Test for $k=1$:\n    $$2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{29}$$\n    Since $2 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$, the order is not $1$.\n\n2.  Test for $k=2$:\n    $$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{29}$$\n    Since $4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$, the order is not $2$.\n\n3.  Test for $k=4$:\n    We can use the previous result:\n    $$2^4 = (2^2)^2 \\equiv 4^2 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{29}$$\n    Since $16 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$, the order is not $4$.\n\n4.  Test for $k=7$:\n    We can compute this sequentially:\n    $2^5 = 2 \\times 2^4 \\equiv 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{29}$.\n    $2^7 = 2^2 \\times 2^5 \\equiv 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\pmod{29}$.\n    Since $12 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$, the order is not $7$.\n\n5.  Test for $k=14$:\n    Using the result for $k=7$:\n    $$2^{14} = (2^7)^2 \\equiv 12^2 = 144 \\pmod{29}$$\n    To reduce $144$ modulo $29$, we observe that $29 \\times 5 = 145$. Therefore, $144 \\equiv 145 - 1 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 28 \\pmod{29}$.\n    Since $28 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$, the order is not $14$.\n\nThe modular computations have demonstrated that $2^d \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$ for all proper divisors $d$ of $28$. As the order $k$ must divide $28$, the only remaining possibility is that the order is $28$. We can verify this using our last calculation: $2^{28} = (2^{14})^2 \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{29}$. This confirms our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $29$ is $k=28$.\n\nThe problem also asks to conclude whether $2$ is a primitive root modulo $29$. An element $a$ is a primitive root modulo a prime $p$ if its multiplicative order is equal to $\\varphi(p) = p-1$. In this case, the order of $2$ is $28$, and $\\varphi(29)$ is also $28$. Since the order of the element $2$ is equal to the order of the group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/29\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$, we conclude that $2$ is indeed a primitive root modulo $29$.

We may therefore proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe problem asks for a criterion to identify primitive roots in the multiplicative group of units modulo a prime $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. An element $g \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a primitive root if its order is equal to the order of the group, which is $|\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}| = \\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\nLet $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ and let $n = |G| = p-1$. By Fermat's Little Theorem or Lagrange's Theorem, for any element $a \\in G$, the order of $a$, denoted $\\text{ord}_p(a)$, must divide $n$. A primitive root $g$ is an element for which $\\text{ord}_p(g) = n$.\n\nTo derive a criterion for an element $g$ to be a primitive root, we consider the alternative: what does it mean for $g$ *not* to be a primitive root? If $g$ is not a primitive root, its order $d = \\text{ord}_p(g)$ must be a proper divisor of $n=p-1$. That is, $d < n$ and $d|n$.\n\nLet the prime factorization of $n=p-1$ be $n = q_1^{e_1} q_2^{e_2} \\cdots q_k^{e_k}$, where $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$. If $d$ is a proper divisor of $n$, then there must be some prime factor $q_i$ of $n$ such that the power of $q_i$ dividing $d$ is less than the power of $q_i$ dividing $n$. This implies that $d$ must divide the integer $\\frac{n}{q_i}$ for at least one $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nThe statement \"$\\text{ord}_p(g)$ divides $m$\" is equivalent to the condition $g^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, $g$ is not a primitive root if and only if its order, $\\text{ord}_p(g)$, divides $\\frac{p-1}{q_i}$ for at least one of the distinct prime factors $q_i$ of $p-1$. This is equivalent to stating that $g^{(p-1)/q_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for at least one $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nBy taking the logical contrapositive of this statement, we arrive at the necessary and sufficient criterion for $g$ to be a primitive root:\nAn element $g \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if and only if $g^{(p-1)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for every distinct prime factor $q$ of $p-1$.\n\nWe now apply this criterion to the specific case $p=97$.

As it is the first one we have found by testing in increasing order, $5$ is the least primitive root modulo $97$.\n\nFinally, we characterize and enumerate all primitive roots modulo $97$. Since $g=5$ is a primitive root, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/97\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is cyclic and generated by $5$. The elements are $\\{5^1, 5^2, \\dots, 5^{96}\\}$.

The analysis will proceed in three steps as specified. The prime is $p=19$ and the element is $a=2$.\n\nFirst, we determine the order of $2$ in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The problem states that for a prime $p$, this group is cyclic of order $p-1$. For $p=19$, a prime, the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $\\varphi(19) = 19-1 = 18$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in this group must be a divisor of the order of the group. The divisors of $18$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9$, and $18$. To find the order of $2$, we must find the smallest positive integer $t$ from this set such that $2^t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$. We test the proper divisors of $18$:\n- $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{19}$\n- $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{19}$\n- $2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{19}$\n- $2^6 = (2^3)^2 \\equiv 8^2 = 64 \\equiv 64 - 3 \\times 19 = 7 \\pmod{19}$\n- $2^9 = 2^3 \\times 2^6 \\equiv 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\equiv 56 - 2 \\times 19 = 18 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{19}$\n\nSince $2^k \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$ for any proper divisor $k$ of $18$, the order of $2$ modulo $19$ must be $18$. This establishes that $2$ is a primitive root modulo $19$.\n\nSecond, we are required to verify by explicit computation that $2^{18} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{19^2}$. The modulus is $m = 19^2 = 361$.

This congruence implies the weaker congruence $2^t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$.\nFrom the first part of our analysis, we know that the order of $2$ modulo $19$ is $18$. A fundamental property of orders states that if $a^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$, then the order of $a$ modulo $m$ must divide $n$. Applying this to our case, $18$ must divide $t$.\nSo, $t$ must be a multiple of $18$ and a divisor of $342$. Let us inspect the divisors of $342 = 18 \\times 19$. The integers satisfying these two conditions are $18$ and $18 \\times 19 = 342$.\nIn the second part, we explicitly showed that $2^{18} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{19^2}$. Therefore, the order $t$ cannot be $18$.\nThe only remaining possibility is $t=342$.\nThus, the order of $2$ in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/19^2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $342$.
