Structure of the Group of Units $U(n)$**\n\nThe structure of the group $U(n)$ can be determined by decomposing it into a direct product of simpler groups corresponding to the prime-power factors of $n$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) provides a ring isomorphism:\n$$\n\\mathbb{Z}/360\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThis isomorphism restricts to an isomorphism of the groups of units:\n$$\nU(360) \\cong U(8) \\times U(9) \\times U(5)\n$$\nWe now analyze the structure of each factor group.\n\n*   **The structure of $U(5)$:**\n    The modulus is a prime $p=5$. The group of units $U(p)$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1 = 4$. Thus, $U(5) \\cong C_4$. The elements of $U(5)$ are $\\{\\overline{1}, \\overline{2}, \\overline{3}, \\overline{4}\\}$. To find a generator, we test the element $\\overline{2}$:\n    $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$\n    $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$\n    $2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5$\n    $2^4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$\n    Since the order of $\\overline{2}$ is $4$, it is a generator of $U(5)$. The possible orders of elements in $U(5)$ are the divisors of $4$, which are $1$, $2$, and $4$. The exponent of $U(5)$ is the maximum possible order, which is $4$.\n\n*   **The structure of $U(9)$:**\n    The modulus is a power of an odd prime, $p^k = 3^2$. The group $U(p^k)$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = 9 - 3 = 6$. Thus, $U(9) \\cong C_6$. The elements are $\\{\\overline{1}, \\overline{2}, \\overline{4}, \\overline{5}, \\overline{7}, \\overline{8}\\}$. We test $\\overline{2}$ as a potential generator:\n    $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$\n    $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 9$\n    $2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$\n    $2^4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 9$\n    $2^5 \\equiv 14 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$\n    $2^6 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$\n    The order of $\\overline{2}$ is $6$, so it is a generator of $U(9)$. The possible orders of elements are the divisors of $6$, i.e., $1, 2, 3, 6$. The exponent of $U(9)$ is $6$.\n\n*   **The structure of $U(8)$:**\n    The modulus is $2^k$ with $k=3$. For $k \\ge 3$, the group $U(2^k)$ is not cyclic, but is isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_{2^{k-2}}$. For $k=3$, we have $U(8) \\cong C_2 \\times C_{2^{3-2}} = C_2 \\times C_2$. The order of the group is $\\phi(8) = 8(1 - 1/2) = 4$. The elements are $\\{\\overline{1}, \\overline{3}, \\overline{5}, \\overline{7}\\}$. We determine their orders:\n    $3^2 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$\n    $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$\n    $7^2 = 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$\n    All non-identity elements have order $2$. This confirms the structure $U(8) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. An explicit set of generators is $\\{\\overline{3}, \\overline{5}\\}$. The exponent of $U(8)$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its elements, which is $\\text{lcm}(1, 2, 2, 2) = 2$.\n\nIn summary, the structure of $U(360)$ is given by the isomorphism:\n$$\nU(360) \\cong U(8) \\times U(9) \\times U(5) \\cong (C_2 \\times C_2) \\times C_6 \\times C_4\n$$\n\n**2. The Exponent of $U(360)$**\n\nThe exponent of a finite group is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all its elements. For a direct product of groups $G = G_1 \\times \\dots \\times G_k$, the exponent of $G$ is the lcm of the exponents of the factor groups $G_i$. The exponent of $U(n)$ is also known as the Carmichael function, $\\lambda(n)$.\n$$\n\\text{exponent}(U(n)) = \\lambda(n) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{exponent}(U(8)), \\text{exponent}(U(9)), \\text{exponent}(U(5)))\n$$\nUsing the results from Part 1:\n$$\n\\lambda(360) = \\text{lcm}(\\lambda(8), \\lambda(9), \\lambda(5)) = \\text{lcm}(2, 6, 4)\n$$\nComputing the lcm: $\\text{lcm}(2, 6) = 6$, and $\\text{lcm}(6, 4) = 12$.\nTherefore, the exponent of $U(360)$ is $12$.\n\n**3. Numerical Verification and Element of Maximal Order**\n\nFirst, we verify Euler's theorem for $a \\in \\{7, 13, 77\\}$. The theorem states that $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$ for any $a$ coprime to $n$. We calculate $\\phi(n)$:\n$$\n\\phi(360) = \\phi(8) \\cdot \\phi(9) \\cdot \\phi(5) = 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 = 96\n$$\nWe must verify $a^{96} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{360}$. This is true if and only if $a^{96} \\equiv 1$ modulo $8$, $9$, and $5$.\n\n*   For $a=7$:\n    - Modulo $8$: $7 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 8 \\implies 7^{96} \\equiv (-1)^{96} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n    - Modulo $9$: By Euler's totient theorem, $7^{\\phi(9)} = 7^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$. As $96 = 16 \\cdot 6$, $7^{96} = (7^6)^{16} \\equiv 1^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$.\n    - Modulo $5$: By Fermat's Little Theorem, $7^{\\phi(5)} = 7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$. As $96 = 24 \\cdot 4$, $7^{96} = (7^4)^{24} \\equiv 1^{24} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.\n    Since the congruence holds for the pairwise coprime moduli $8, 9, 5$, it holds for their product $360$.\n\n*   For $a=13$:\n    - Modulo $8$: $13 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$. Since $\\text{ord}_8(5)=2$, $13^{96} \\equiv 5^{96} = (5^2)^{48} \\equiv 1^{48} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n    - Modulo $9$: $13 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 9$. $13^{\\phi(9)} = 13^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$. $13^{96}=(13^6)^{16} \\equiv 1^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$.\n    - Modulo $5$: $13 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5$. $13^{\\phi(5)} = 13^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$. $13^{96}=(13^4)^{24} \\equiv 1^{24} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.\n    By CRT, $13^{96} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{360}$.\n\n*   For $a=77$:\n    - Modulo $8$: $77 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$. $77^{96} \\equiv 5^{96} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n    - Modulo $9$: $77 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$. $77^{\\phi(9)} = 77^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$. $77^{96}=(77^6)^{16} \\equiv 1^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$.\n    - Modulo $5$: $77 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$. $77^{\\phi(5)} = 77^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$. $77^{96}=(77^4)^{24} \\equiv 1^{24} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.\n    By CRT, $77^{96} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{360}$.\n\nEuler's theorem is verified for the given values.\n\nFinally, we find an element of $U(360)$ whose order is the exponent, $12$. The order of an element $x \\in U(360)$ is the lcm of its orders in the component groups $U(8)$, $U(9)$, and $U(5)$. To achieve an order of $12 = \\text{lcm}(2, 6, 4)$, we need to find an element $x$ satisfying a system of congruences where its components have orders whose lcm is $12$. We can choose component orders of $2, 3, 4$ or $2, 6, 4$. Let's choose orders $2, 6, 4$:\n1.  In $U(8)$, we need an element of order $2$. We choose $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$.\n2.  In $U(9)$, we need an element of order $6$. A generator, such as $2$, will suffice: $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$.\n3.  In $U(5)$, we need an element of order $4$. A generator, such as $2$, will suffice: $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$.\n\nWe must solve the system of congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8 \\\\\nx \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9 \\\\\nx \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the second and third congruences, since $\\gcd(9,5)=1$, $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{45}$. So, $x$ can be written as $x = 45k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the first congruence:\n$$\n45k + 2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8\n$$\nReducing the coefficients modulo $8$:\n$$\n5k + 2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8\n$$\n$$\n5k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8\n$$\nTo solve for $k$, we find the multiplicative inverse of $5$ modulo $8$. Since $5 \\cdot 5 = 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, the inverse is $5$. Multiplying the congruence by $5$:\n$$\n5 \\cdot (5k) \\equiv 5 \\cdot 1 \\pmod 8\n$$\n$$\nk \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8\n$$\nSo, $k = 8m + 5$ for some integer $m$. Substituting this back into the expression for $x$:\n$$\nx = 45(8m + 5) + 2 = 360m + 225 + 2 = 360m + 227\n$$\nThe smallest positive solution is $x=227$. Let's check its properties.\n$227 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$ (order is $2$).\n$227 = 25 \\cdot 9 + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$ (order is $6$).\n$227 = 45 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ (order is $4$).\nThe order of $227$ in $U(360)$ is $\\text{lcm}(2, 6, 4) = 12$. Thus, $227$ is an element of maximal order.\nThe exponent of $U(n)$ is indeed $12$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12}\n$$", "id": "3014240"}, {"introduction": "Our final exercise [@problem_id:3014233] presents a comprehensive challenge that synthesizes our understanding of both the group of units and the broader ring of integers modulo $n$.

This implies that $T$ must be a common multiple of all the $T_i$, and since we seek the least positive $T$, we must have $T = \\operatorname{lcm}(T_1, T_2, \\dots, T_m)$. Similarly, the condition must hold for all $k \\ge L$, which must satisfy $k \\ge L_i$ for all $i$. Thus, $L$ must be at least as large as every $L_i$. As we seek the least non-negative $L$, we must have $L = \\max(L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_m)$.\n\nWe analyze the behavior of the sequence $a^k \\pmod{p^e}$ based on whether the prime $p$ divides $a$.\n\nCase 1: $p \\nmid a$ (i.e., $\\gcd(a, p) = 1$)\nIn this case, $a$ is a unit in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^e\\mathbb{Z}$, and belongs to the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^e\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The congruence $a^{k+T_i} \\equiv a^k \\pmod{p_i^{e_i}}$ can be multiplied by $(a^{-1})^k$, which exists, to yield $a^{T_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i^{e_i}}$. This relation holds for all $k \\ge 0$. Thus, the preperiod length is $L_i = 0$. The least positive integer $T_i$ satisfying this is, by definition, the multiplicative order of $a$ modulo $p_i^{e_i}$, denoted $T_i = \\operatorname{ord}_{p_i^{e_i}}(a)$.\nTo find this order from first principles, we use the property of lifting orders from $p$ to $p^e$. Let $T_{i,1} = \\operatorname{ord}_{p_i}(a)$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{p_i-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}$, so $T_{i,1}$ divides $p_i-1$. From $a^{T_{i,1}} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}$, we can write $a^{T_{i,1}} = 1 + c p_i^s$ for some integer $c$ with $p_i \\nmid c$ and $s = v_{p_i}(a^{T_{i,1}}-1) \\ge 1$. For a prime $p>2$, one can show using the binomial theorem that $v_p((1+cp^s)^p - 1) = s+1$. By induction, $v_p(a^{T_{i,1}p_i^j}-1) = s+j$. We need to find the minimal $m \\ge 1$ such that $a^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i^{e_i}}$, which is equivalent to $v_{p_i}(a^m-1) \\ge e_i$. The order $m$ must be a multiple of $T_{i,1}$, say $m = k T_{i,1}$. The valuation is maximized for a given power of $p_i$ in $k$. Let $k=p_i^j$. Then $v_{p_i}(a^{T_{i,1}p_i^j}-1) = s+j$. To satisfy the condition, we need $s+j \\ge e_i$, so the minimal non-negative integer $j$ is $\\max(0, e_i-s)$. Thus, the order is $T_i = T_{i,1} \\cdot p_i^{\\max(0, e_i-s)}$.\n\nCase 2: $p | a$\nLet $v_p(a) = j \\ge 1$. We can write $a = p^j m$ where $\\gcd(m, p) = 1$. Then $a^k = (p^j m)^k = p^{jk} m^k$. For the congruence $a^k \\pmod{p^e}$, whenever $jk \\ge e$, the term $p^{jk}$ is divisible by $p^e$, so $a^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^e}$. The smallest integer $k$ for which this holds is $L_i = \\lceil e_i/j \\rceil$. For any $k \\ge L_i$, we have $a^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p_i^{e_i}}$. The sequence becomes constant (all zeros). A constant sequence has a period of $1$. Thus, for $k \\ge L_i$, $a^{k+1} \\equiv 0 \\equiv a^k \\pmod{p_i^{e_i}}$. The minimal positive period is $T_i=1$. The value $L_i = \\lceil e_i/j \\rceil$ is indeed the minimal preperiod length, because for $k = L_i-1$, we have $j(L_i-1)  j(e_i/j) = e_i$, so $v_{p_i}(a^{L_i-1})  e_i$, which implies $a^{L_i-1} \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p_i^{e_i}}$. The sequence has not yet stabilized to $0$, so the preperiod must be at least $L_i$.\n\nNow we apply this framework to the specific problem with $n = 3^4 \\cdot 7^3 \\cdot 13^2$ and $a=3$.\n\n1. Modulo $p_1^{e_1} = 3^4 = 81$:\nHere $p_1=3$ and it divides $a=3$.

This is Case 1.\nThe local preperiod length is $L_3 = 0$.\nThe local period is $T_3 = \\operatorname{ord}_{13^2}(3)$.\nFirst, we find the order modulo $13$:\n$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nSo, $\\operatorname{ord}_{13}(3) = 3$.\nNext, we find $s = v_{13}(3^3-1)$.\n$3^3-1 = 26 = 2 \\cdot 13$.\nSo, $s = v_{13}(26) = 1$.\nUsing our derived formula for $p=13, e=2, \\operatorname{ord}_{13}(3)=3, s=1$:\n$T_3 = \\operatorname{ord}_{13^2}(3) = \\operatorname{ord}_{13}(3) \\cdot 13^{\\max(0, 2-1)} = 3 \\cdot 13^1 = 39$.\n\nFinally, we synthesize the results for the modulus $n$.\nThe overall strict preperiod length is $L = \\max(L_1, L_2, L_3) = \\max(4, 0, 0) = 4$.\nThe overall eventual period is $T = \\operatorname{lcm}(T_1, T_2, T_3) = \\operatorname{lcm}(1, 294, 39)$.\nTo compute the lcm, we find the prime factorizations:\n$294 = 2 \\cdot 147 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 49 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7^2$.\n$39 = 3 \\cdot 13$.\n$T = \\operatorname{lcm}(1, 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7^2, 3 \\cdot 13) = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 13^1 = 6 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 13 = 294 \\cdot 13 = 3822$.\n\nThus, the strict preperiod length is $L=4$ and the eventual period is $T=3822$. This means that for all $k \\ge 4$, $3^{k+3822} \\equiv 3^k \\pmod{3^4 \\cdot 7^3 \\cdot 13^2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3822  4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3014233"}]}
