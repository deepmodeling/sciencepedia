The given system is:\n$$x \\equiv 47 \\pmod{65}$$\n$$x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{27}$$\n$$x \\equiv 19 \\pmod{32}$$\nThe moduli are $m_{1}=65$, $m_{2}=27$, and $m_{3}=32$. We first verify that they are pairwise coprime. The prime factorization of each is $m_{1}=5 \\times 13$, $m_{2}=3^{3}$, and $m_{3}=2^{5}$. Since they share no common prime factors, they are indeed pairwise coprime. The Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a unique solution for $x$ modulo $M = m_{1}m_{2}m_{3}$.\nLet us calculate $M$:\n$$M = 65 \\times 27 \\times 32 = 1755 \\times 32 = 56160$$\nWe seek the least non-negative integer solution $x$ in the interval $[0, 56159]$.\n\n### Method A: Construction via Orthogonal Idempotents\n\nThis method relies on the ring isomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/m_{1}\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m_{2}\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m_{3}\\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\phi(x \\pmod{M}) = (x \\pmod{m_{1}}, x \\pmod{m_{2}}, x \\pmod{m_{3}})$. We are given the target tuple $(47, 8, 19)$ and must find the pre-image $x$. We construct this pre-image by finding special elements $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3} \\in \\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z}$ that correspond to the standard basis vectors $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$ in the product ring. These elements are the orthogonal idempotents.\n\nThe element $e_{i}$ must satisfy:\n$$e_{i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m_{i}}$$\n$$e_{i} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{m_{j}} \\quad \\text{for } j \\neq i$$\nThe second condition implies that $e_{i}$ must be a multiple of $M_{i} = M/m_{i} = \\prod_{j \\neq i} m_{j}$. So, we can write $e_{i} = c_{i} M_{i}$ for some integer $c_{i}$.\nThe first condition becomes $c_{i} M_{i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m_{i}}$. This means $c_{i}$ is the modular multiplicative inverse of $M_{i}$ modulo $m_{i}$. The existence of this inverse is guaranteed by $\\gcd(M_{i}, m_{i}) = 1$, which is true because the $m_{j}$ are pairwise coprime.\nOnce we find $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$, the solution $x$ is given by the linear combination:\n$$x \\equiv a_{1}e_{1} + a_{2}e_{2} + a_{3}e_{3} \\pmod{M}$$\nwhere $a_{1}=47$, $a_{2}=8$, $a_{3}=19$. This construction works because when we reduce $x$ modulo $m_{i}$, all terms $a_{j}e_{j}$ for $j \\neq i$ become $0$ since $e_{j} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{m_{i}}$. The term $a_{i}e_{i}$ becomes $a_{i} \\cdot 1 = a_{i}$. Thus, $x \\equiv a_{i} \\pmod{m_{i}}$ for each $i$, satisfying the entire system.\n\n**1. Calculation of $e_{1}$:**\n$M_{1} = m_{2}m_{3} = 27 \\times 32 = 864$. We need to solve $c_{1} \\cdot 864 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{65}$.\nFirst, reduce $864$ modulo $65$: $864 = 13 \\times 65 + 19$.

The congruence is $1c_{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$.\nSo, $c_{2}=1$.\n$e_{2} = c_{2}M_{2} = 1 \\times 2080 = 2080$.\n\n**3. Calculation of $e_{3}$:**\n$M_{3} = m_{1}m_{2} = 65 \\times 27 = 1755$. We need to solve $c_{3} \\cdot 1755 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$.\nReduce $1755$ modulo $32$: $1755 = 54 \\times 32 + 27$. The congruence is $27c_{3} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$, which is equivalent to $-5c_{3} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$.\nWe use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for $\\gcd(32, 27)$.\n$32 = 1 \\cdot 27 + 5$\n$27 = 5 \\cdot 5 + 2$\n$5 = 2 \\cdot 2 + 1$\nWorking backwards:\n$1 = 5 - 2 \\cdot 2 = 5 - 2 \\cdot (27 - 5 \\cdot 5) = 11 \\cdot 5 - 2 \\cdot 27$\n$1 = 11 \\cdot (32 - 1 \\cdot 27) - 2 \\cdot 27 = 11 \\cdot 32 - 13 \\cdot 27$.\nSo, $-13 \\cdot 27 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$.

Combine the first two congruences:**\n$x \\equiv 47 \\pmod{65}$\n$x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{27}$\nFrom the first congruence, $x$ can be written as $x = 65k + 47$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second congruence:\n$65k + 47 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{27}$\n$65k \\equiv 8 - 47 \\pmod{27}$\n$65k \\equiv -39 \\pmod{27}$\nReducing the coefficients modulo $27$: $65 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{27}$ and $-39 \\equiv 15 \\pmod{27}$.\nThe congruence becomes $11k \\equiv 15 \\pmod{27}$.\nTo solve for $k$, we need the inverse of $11$ modulo $27$. From the Euclidean Algorithm:\n$27 = 2 \\cdot 11 + 5$\n$11 = 2 \\cdot 5 + 1$\n$1 = 11 - 2 \\cdot 5 = 11 - 2(27 - 2 \\cdot 11) = 5 \\cdot 11 - 2 \\cdot 27$.\nThus, $5 \\cdot 11 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$. The inverse is $5$.\nMultiplying the congruence by $5$:\n$k \\equiv 15 \\cdot 5 \\pmod{27} \\implies k \\equiv 75 \\pmod{27}$.\nSince $75 = 2 \\times 27 + 21$, we have $k \\equiv 21 \\pmod{27}$.\nSo, $k = 27j + 21$ for some integer $j$.\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $x$:\n$x = 65(27j + 21) + 47 = (65 \\cdot 27)j + (65 \\cdot 21) + 47 = 1755j + 1365 + 47 = 1755j + 1412$.\nThis combines the first two congruences into a single one: $x \\equiv 1412 \\pmod{1755}$.\n\n**2. Combine with the third congruence:**\nWe now solve the system:\n$x \\equiv 1412 \\pmod{1755}$\n$x \\equiv 19 \\pmod{32}$\nFrom the new congruence, $x = 1755j + 1412$. Substituting into the third original congruence:\n$1755j + 1412 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{32}$\n$1755j \\equiv 19 - 1412 \\pmod{32}$\n$1755j \\equiv -1393 \\pmod{32}$\nReducing coefficients modulo $32$:\n$1755 = 54 \\times 32 + 27 \\implies 1755 \\equiv 27 \\pmod{32}$.\n$-1393 = -44 \\times 32 + 15 \\implies -1393 \\equiv 15 \\pmod{32}$.\nThe congruence becomes $27j \\equiv 15 \\pmod{32}$.\nWe need the inverse of $27$ modulo $32$. As calculated in Method A, from $11 \\cdot 32 - 13 \\cdot 27 = 1$, we have $-13 \\cdot 27 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$. The inverse is $-13 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{32}$.\nMultiplying the congruence by $19$:\n$j \\equiv 15 \\cdot 19 \\pmod{32} \\implies j \\equiv 285 \\pmod{32}$.\nSince $285 = 8 \\times 32 + 29$, we have $j \\equiv 29 \\pmod{32}$.\nSo, $j = 32l + 29$ for some integer $l$.\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $x$:\n$x = 1755(32l + 29) + 1412 = (1755 \\cdot 32)l + (1755 \\cdot 29) + 1412$\n$x = 56160l + 50895 + 1412 = 56160l + 52307$.\nThe final solution is $x \\equiv 52307 \\pmod{56160}$.\n\n### Verification\nBoth methods yield the same congruence, $x \\equiv 52307 \\pmod{56160}$. The least non-negative representative in the interval $[0, 56159]$ is $52307$. We can verify this solution:\n$52307 = 804 \\times 65 + 47 \\implies 52307 \\equiv 47 \\pmod{65}$.\n$52307 = 1937 \\times 27 + 8 \\implies 52307 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{27}$.\n$52307 = 1634 \\times 32 + 19 \\implies 52307 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{32}$.\nThe solution is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{52307}$$", "id": "3017080"}, {"introduction": "The standard formulation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem requires pairwise coprime moduli, but what happens when this condition is not met?

The moduli are $m_1 = 12$ and $m_2 = 18$. Their greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(12, 18) = 6$. Since the moduli are not coprime, a solution exists only if the congruences are consistent.\n\nLet us derive the consistency condition from first principles. The congruences $x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{m_1}$ and $x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{m_2}$ are equivalent to the existence of integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that:\n$x = k_1 m_1 + a_1$\n$x = k_2 m_2 + a_2$\nFor a solution $x$ to exist, we must have $k_1 m_1 + a_1 = k_2 m_2 + a_2$, which can be rearranged into a linear Diophantine equation in variables $k_1$ and $k_2$:\n$m_1 k_1 - m_2 k_2 = a_2 - a_1$\nA well-known result from number theory states that this equation has integer solutions for $(k_1, k_2)$ if and only if $\\gcd(m_1, m_2)$ divides the right-hand side, $a_2 - a_1$. This is the necessary and sufficient consistency condition. This condition can be expressed as a congruence: $a_1 \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{\\gcd(m_1, m_2)}$.\n\nFor the given congruences $x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ and $x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{18}$, we have $a_1 = 5$, $m_1 = 12$, $a_2 = 11$, and $m_2 = 18$. The consistency condition is:\n$5 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{\\gcd(12, 18)}$\n$\\gcd(12, 18) = 6$. The condition becomes $5 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{6}$.\nThis is true because $11 - 5 = 6$, and $6$ is divisible by $6$. Thus, the first two congruences are consistent, and a common solution exists.\n\nNow, we find this common solution. From $x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$, we can write $x = 12k + 5$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second congruence:\n$12k + 5 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{18}$\n$12k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{18}$\nThis is a linear congruence of the form $au \\equiv b \\pmod n$. It has solutions for $u$ if and only if $\\gcd(a, n)$ divides $b$. Here, $\\gcd(12, 18) = 6$, which divides $6$. The congruence is solvable. We can divide the entire relation (including the modulus) by this gcd:\n$\\frac{12}{6}k \\equiv \\frac{6}{6} \\pmod{\\frac{18}{6}}$\n$2k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\nTo solve for $k$, we multiply by the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $3$. Since $2 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, the inverse of $2$ is $2$.\n$2 \\cdot (2k) \\equiv 2 \\cdot 1 \\pmod{3}$\n$k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\nThis means $k$ must be of the form $k = 3j + 2$ for some integer $j$. Substituting this back into the expression for $x$:\n$x = 12(3j + 2) + 5 = 36j + 24 + 5 = 36j + 29$\nThis is equivalent to the single congruence $x \\equiv 29 \\pmod{36}$.

The recurrence relations are $r_{i+1} = r_{i-1} - q_i r_i$, $s_{i+1} = s_{i-1} - q_i s_i$, and $t_{i+1} = t_{i-1} - q_i t_i$, where $q_i = \\lfloor r_{i-1} / r_i \\rfloor$.\n\nThe steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n$r_0 = 1113121$, $r_1 = 567890$.\n1. $1113121 = 1 \\cdot 567890 + 545231$, so $q_2=1$.\n2. $567890 = 1 \\cdot 545231 + 22659$, so $q_3=1$.\n3. $545231 = 24 \\cdot 22659 + 1415$, so $q_4=24$.\n4. $22659 = 16 \\cdot 1415 + 19$, so $q_5=16$.\n5. $1415 = 74 \\cdot 19 + 9$, so $q_6=74$.\n6. $19 = 2 \\cdot 9 + 1$, so $q_7=2$.\n7. $9 = 9 \\cdot 1 + 0$, so $\\gcd(a, n)=1$.\n\nNow we build the table for $s_i$ and $t_i$:\n$i$ | $r_i$     | $q_i$ | $s_i$     | $t_i$\n--|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------\n$0$ | $1113121$   | -     | $1$         | $0$\n$1$ | $567890$    | -     | $0$         | $1$\n$2$ | $545231$    | $1$     | $1 - 1 \\cdot 0 = 1$ | $0 - 1 \\cdot 1 = -1$\n$3$ | $22659$     | $1$     | $0 - 1 \\cdot 1 = -1$ | $1 - 1 \\cdot (-1) = 2$\n$4$ | $1415$      | $24$    | $1 - 24 \\cdot (-1) = 25$ | $-1 - 24 \\cdot 2 = -49$\n$5$ | $19$        | $16$    | $-1 - 16 \\cdot 25 = -401$ | $2 - 16 \\cdot (-49) = 786$\n$6$ | $9$         | $74$    | $25 - 74 \\cdot (-401) = 29699$ | $-49 - 74 \\cdot 786 = -58213$\n$7$ | $1$         | $2$     | $-401 - 2 \\cdot 29699 = -59799$ | $786 - 2 \\cdot (-58213) = 117212$\n\nFrom the last row, we have $r_7 = 1$, with $s_7 = -59799$ and $t_7 = 117212$. This gives the Bezout identity:\n$$1 = (-59799) \\cdot n + (117212) \\cdot a$$\n$$-59799 \\cdot 1113121 + 117212 \\cdot 567890 = 1$$\nTaking this equation modulo $n = 1113121$, we get:\n$$117212 \\cdot 567890 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1113121}$$\nThe multiplicative inverse $x$ is the coefficient of $a$, which is $117212$. This value is in the required range $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 1113120\\}$.\nSo, $x = 117212$.\n\n**Part 2: Verification using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\nThe CRT states that the single congruence $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ is equivalent to a system of congruences modulo the prime power factors of $n$. Since $n = 101 \\cdot 103 \\cdot 107$, the original congruence is equivalent to the system:\n1. $567890x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$\n2. $567890x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{103}$\n3. $567890x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{107}$\n\nWe first reduce $a = 567890$ modulo each prime factor:\n- $a \\equiv 68 \\pmod{101}$\n- $a \\equiv 51 \\pmod{103}$\n- $a \\equiv 41 \\pmod{107}$\n\nSubstituting these into the system, we get:\n1. $68x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$\n2. $51x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{103}$\n3. $41x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{107}$\n\nTo verify our solution $x=117212$, we must show it satisfies this system of congruences. To do this, we need to know what $x$ should be congruent to modulo each prime. We find the inverses for each congruence:\n- For $68x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}$: Using the EEA for $68$ and $101$, we find $1 = 33 \\cdot 101 - 49 \\cdot 68$. Thus, $68^{-1} \\equiv -49 \\equiv 52 \\pmod{101}$. So, $x$ must be congruent to $52 \\pmod{101}$.\n- For $51x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{103}$: From $103 = 2 \\cdot 51 + 1$, we have $1 = 103 - 2 \\cdot 51$. Thus, $51^{-1} \\equiv -2 \\equiv 101 \\pmod{103}$. So, $x$ must be congruent to $101 \\pmod{103}$.\n- For $41x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{107}$: Using the EEA for $41$ and $107$, we find $1 = 47 \\cdot 41 - 18 \\cdot 107$. Thus, $41^{-1} \\equiv 47 \\pmod{107}$. So, $x$ must be congruent to $47 \\pmod{107}$.\n\nThe system of congruences that the solution $x$ must satisfy is:\n1. $x \\equiv 52 \\pmod{101}$\n2. $x \\equiv 101 \\pmod{103}$\n3. $x \\equiv 47 \\pmod{107}$\n\nNow, we verify if our candidate solution $x = 117212$ satisfies this system.\n1. Check modulo $101$: $117212 = 1160 \\cdot 101 + 52$. Thus, $117212 \\equiv 52 \\pmod{101}$. This congruence is satisfied.\n2. Check modulo $103$: $117212 = 1137 \\cdot 103 + 101$. Thus, $117212 \\equiv 101 \\pmod{103}$. This congruence is satisfied.\n3. Check modulo $107$: $117212 = 1095 \\cdot 107 + 47$. Thus, $117212 \\equiv 47 \\pmod{107}$. This congruence is satisfied.\n\nThe solution $x=117212$ obtained via the EEA is consistent with the system of congruences derived from the prime factors of $n$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, this system has a unique solution modulo $n = 1113121$. Since our solution satisfies the system and is in the correct range, it is the correct unique inverse.
