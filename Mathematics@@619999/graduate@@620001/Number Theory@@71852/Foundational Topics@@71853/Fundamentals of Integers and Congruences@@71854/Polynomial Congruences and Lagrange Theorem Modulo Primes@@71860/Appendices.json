A closed-form expression for $N(p,d)$, the number of monic polynomials in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ of degree $d$ with exactly $d$ distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$, for a prime $p$ and an integer $d$ where $0 \\le d \\le p$.\n2.  A justification that the upper bound on the number of roots of a polynomial is sharp for degrees $d$ from $0$ to $p$.\n3.  An explanation for why no such polynomial exists for $d > p$.\n\nWe will address each part in sequence.\n\nFirst, we determine the closed-form expression for $N(p,d)$.\nLet $f(x)$ be a monic polynomial of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ with exactly $d$ distinct roots in the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. Let these distinct roots be $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d$, where each $r_i \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\n\nThe Factor Theorem, a direct consequence of the polynomial division algorithm, states that if $a$ is a root of a polynomial $g(x)$ over a field, then $(x-a)$ is a factor of $g(x)$. Since $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d$ are distinct roots of $f(x)$, the polynomial $f(x)$ must be divisible by each of the distinct linear factors $(x-r_1), (x-r_2), \\ldots, (x-r_d)$. Because these factors are pairwise coprime, $f(x)$ must be divisible by their product, $\\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)$.\nThis means we can write $f(x)$ as:\n$$f(x) = q(x) \\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)$$\nfor some polynomial $q(x) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$.\n\nThe degree of the product $\\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)$ is $d$. The degree of $f(x)$ is given as $d$. Therefore, the degree of $q(x)$ must be $\\deg(f) - \\deg(\\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)) = d - d = 0$. This implies that $q(x)$ is a non-zero constant, say $q(x) = c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nSo, $f(x)$ has the form:\n$$f(x) = c \\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)$$\nThe problem requires $f(x)$ to be a monic polynomial, which means its leading coefficient must be $1$. The leading term of the expansion of $\\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)$ is $x^d$, so its leading coefficient is $1$. For $f(x)$ to be monic, the constant $c$ must be equal to $1$.\nThus, any such polynomial is uniquely determined by its set of roots:\n$$f(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)$$\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of monic polynomials of degree $d$ with $d$ distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ and the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ of size $d$.\n\nThe problem of finding $N(p,d)$ is therefore reduced to a combinatorial counting problem: we must count the number of ways to choose $d$ distinct elements from the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ to serve as the roots. The field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ has $p$ elements. The number of ways to choose a subset of $d$ elements from a set of $p$ elements is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{p}{d}$.\nTherefore, for $0 \\le d \\le p$:\n$$N(p,d) = \\binom{p}{d} = \\frac{p!}{d!(p-d)!}$$\nThis holds even for the case $d=0$. A monic polynomial of degree $0$ is $f(x)=1$. This polynomial has no roots, so it has exactly $0$ distinct roots. There is only one such polynomial. Our formula gives $N(p,0) = \\binom{p}{0} = 1$, which is correct.\n\nSecond, we justify that the upper bound on the number of roots is sharp for $0 \\le d \\le p$.\nThe problem states as a given principle that a nonzero polynomial of degree $d$ over a field has at most $d$ roots. To show this bound is sharp means to demonstrate that for any given integer $d$ in the range $0 \\le d \\le p$, there exists at least one polynomial of degree $d$ that has exactly $d$ roots.\n\nLet $d$ be any integer such that $0 \\le d \\le p$. Since the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ contains $p$ elements and $d \\le p$, it is possible to select a subset of $d$ distinct elements from $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. Let this set of distinct elements be $R = \\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\}$.\nWe construct the polynomial $f(x)$ as follows:\n$$f(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{d} (x-r_i)$$\nIf $d=0$, this is an empty product, which is defined to be $1$. The polynomial is $f(x)=1$, which has degree $0$ and $0$ roots.\nIf $d > 0$, the expansion of this product results in a monic polynomial of degree $d$. For each $r_i \\in R$, we have $f(r_i) = \\prod_{j=1}^{d} (r_i - r_j) = 0$, since the term where $j=i$ is zero. Thus, $f(x)$ has at least $d$ distinct roots, namely $r_1, \\ldots, r_d$.\nBy the given principle, as a polynomial of degree $d$, $f(x)$ can have at most $d$ roots.\nCombining these two facts, the constructed polynomial $f(x)$ has exactly $d$ roots.\nSince we can perform this construction for any integer $d$ in the range $0 \\le d \\le p$, the bound is sharp for all these degrees.\n\nThird, we explain why no such monic polynomial exists when $d > p$.\nLet $d$ be an integer such that $d > p$. We are asked to consider the existence of a monic polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $d$ with exactly $d$ distinct roots in the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\nLet us suppose such a polynomial exists. Let its $d$ distinct roots be $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d$.\nBy definition, these roots must belong to the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. The set of roots $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\}$ is therefore a subset of $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\nThe problem states that the roots are distinct, which means the cardinality of this set of roots is $d$.\nThe field $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is the set of integers modulo $p$, which has exactly $p$ elements. So, $|\\mathbb{F}_{p}| = p$.\nThis leads to a contradiction. We have a set of roots of cardinality $d$ which must be a subset of a set of cardinality $p$, but we are given $d > p$. It is impossible for a set to contain a subset of a strictly larger cardinality.\nThis contradiction proves that our initial assumption must be false. Therefore, no such set of $d$ distinct roots can be chosen from $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$, and consequently, no polynomial of degree $d$ can have $d$ distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ if $d>p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\binom{p}{d}}$$", "id": "3021092"}, {"introduction": "The integrity of a field, specifically the absence of zero divisors, is a cornerstone upon which Lagrange’s theorem rests.

It is a well-posed question in elementary number theory, grounded in the established principles of modular arithmetic and the structure of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. It is self-contained, objective, and its resolution requires a direct application of standard, non-trivial mathematical reasoning.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the number of solutions to the polynomial congruence $x^2 \\equiv x \\pmod{420}$. This is equivalent to finding the number of roots of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 - x$ in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/420\\mathbb{Z}$. Such roots are known as idempotent elements of the ring.\n\nThe core strategy is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). First, we find the prime factorization of the modulus $n=420$.\n$$420 = 42 \\times 10 = (6 \\times 7) \\times (2 \\times 5) = (2 \\times 3 \\times 7) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$$\nThe congruence $x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{420}$ holds if and only if the following system of congruences is satisfied simultaneously:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe will now determine the number of solutions for each of these congruences. Let $N_{p^k}$ be the number of solutions to $x^2-x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^k}$.\n\nCase 1: Modulo $p$ for primes $p \\in \\{3, 5, 7\\}$.\nThe congruence is $x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, which can be written as $x(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $p$ is a prime number, the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is a field. A field is an integral domain, meaning it has no zero divisors. Therefore, for the product $x(x-1)$ to be congruent to $0$, at least one of the factors must be congruent to $0$.\nThis leads to two possibilities:\n- $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$\n- $x - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, which implies $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$\nThese two solutions are distinct for any prime $p$.\nThus, for $p=3$, we have $2$ solutions: $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. So, $N_3 = 2$.\nFor $p=5$, we have $2$ solutions: $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. So, $N_5 = 2$.\nFor $p=7$, we have $2$ solutions: $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. So, $N_7 = 2$.\n\nCase 2: Modulo $4$.\nThe congruence is $x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, which is $x(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field and contains a zero divisor ($2$, since $2 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$). Therefore, we cannot simply conclude that one of the factors must be zero.\nHowever, we can use the provided hint that for any integer $x$, the numbers $x$ and $x-1$ are consecutive integers. Consequently, their greatest common divisor is $1$, i.e., $\\gcd(x, x-1) = 1$.\nThis means that $x$ and $x-1$ share no common prime factors. The prime factorization of $4$ is $2^2$. For the product $x(x-1)$ to be divisible by $4$, the factor of $4$ cannot be split between $x$ and $x-1$. Thus, one of the factors must be divisible by $4$ entirely.\nThis gives two mutually exclusive possibilities:\n- $4$ divides $x$, which means $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- $4$ divides $x-1$, which means $x-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, or $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nWe can verify these are indeed solutions:\n- If $x=0$, then $0^2 - 0 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $x=1$, then $1^2 - 1 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nOther residues modulo $4$ are not solutions:\n- If $x=2$, then $2^2 - 2 = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $x=3$, then $3^2 - 3 = 6 \\equiv 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\nSo, there are exactly $2$ solutions modulo $4$. Thus, $N_4 = 2$.\n\nFinal Step: Combining solutions using the CRT.\nWe have found the number of solutions for each prime power modulus:\n- $N_4 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{4}$.\n- $N_3 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{3}$.\n- $N_5 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{5}$.\n- $N_7 = 2$ solutions for $x \\pmod{7}$.\nFor any combination of choices of one solution from each of these individual congruences, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees the existence of a unique solution modulo $420$. The total number of solutions is therefore the product of the number of solutions for each individual modulus.\nTotal number of solutions $= N_4 \\times N_3 \\times N_5 \\times N_7 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x)=x^2-x$ has degree $2$, but it possesses $16$ distinct roots in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/420\\mathbb{Z}$, concretely demonstrating that Lagrange's theorem on the number of roots of a polynomial does not hold for general commutative rings.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "3021109"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting roots, we can often predict their nature and number using more advanced algebraic invariants.

This implies it is not separable and the number of distinct roots is less than the degree, i.e., at most $2$.\n\n2.  **Justification**: We reduce the polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $3$:\n    $$ f(x) = x^3 - 3x - 1 \\equiv x^3 - 0x - 1 \\equiv x^3 - 1 \\pmod{3} $$\n    Using the property $(a-b)^p \\equiv a^p - b^p \\pmod p$ for a prime $p$ (Freshman's Dream):\n    $$ f(x) \\equiv x^3 - 1^3 \\equiv (x-1)^3 \\pmod{3} $$\n    The factorization is $(x-1)^3$.
