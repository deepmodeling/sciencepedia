It states that an integer $p > 1$ is prime if and only if $(p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$.\n\nA student proposes a related but broader claim about the behavior of factorials under a modulus:\n\"For any integer $n > 2$, the value of the expression $(n-1)! \\pmod n$ is always one of two values: $0$ or $n-1$.\"\n\nInvestigate the validity of this claim.

We analyze by cases.\n\nFirst, if $n$ is prime, Wilson's Theorem states\n$$\n(n-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod n,\n$$\nthat is, $(n-1)! \\equiv n-1 \\pmod n$. Thus all primes $n>2$ satisfy the claim.\n\nNext, suppose $n$ is composite. If $n$ has at least two distinct prime factors, let $p$ be any prime divisor of $n$ and set $s = n/p$. Then $2 \\leq p \\leq n-1$ and $2 \\leq s \\leq n-1$, so both $p$ and $s$ occur among the factors $1,2,\\dots,n-1$. If $p \\neq s$, their product is $ps=n$, hence $n$ divides $(n-1)!$, and therefore\n$$\n(n-1)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod n.\n$$\nSo the claim holds in this subcase.\n\nIt remains to consider $n$ a prime power, $n=p^{a}$ with $a \\geq 2$. The argument that $n \\mid (n-1)!$ still holds unless the required factors are not distinct or available. A more rigorous approach is to count the factors of $p$ in $(n-1)!$. Using Legendre's formula, the exponent of $p$ in $(p^{a}-1)!$ is\n$$\nv_{p}\\big((p^{a}-1)!\\big) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{p^{a}-1}{p^{k}} \\right\\rfloor \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=1}^{a-1} \\left(p^{a-k}-1\\right).\n$$\nWe need $v_{p}\\big((p^{a}-1)!\\big) \\geq a$ to ensure $p^{a} \\mid (p^{a}-1)!$, which would give $(n-1)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$. The sum is at least $p^{a-1}-1$ (from the first term). The inequality $p^{a-1}-1 \\geq a$ holds for all $a \\geq 3$ and all primes $p$, and for $a=2$ whenever $p \\geq 3$ (since $p-1 \\geq 2$). The only case where this fails is $p=2, a=2$, i.e., $n=4$.\nFor $n=4$, the valuation is\n$$\nv_{2}(3!) \\;=\\; \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\;=\\; 1 \\;<\\; 2,\n$$\nso $4 \\nmid 3!$.\n\nDirectly computing this exceptional case:\n$$\n(4-1)! \\;=\\; 3! \\;=\\; 6 \\;\\equiv\\; 2 \\pmod 4,\n$$\nwhich is neither $0$ nor $4-1=3$. Therefore, the claim is false, and $n=4$ is a counterexample.\n\nTo confirm minimality, note $n=3$ (prime) gives $(3-1)! = 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, which is $n-1$.
