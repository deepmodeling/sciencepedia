It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. We proceed with the solution, which consists of three parts as requested by the problem: first, the proof of existence of the pair $(q,r)$; second, the proof of its uniqueness; and third, the determination of the pair $(q_{-}, r_{-})$ in terms of $(q,r)$.\n\n**Part 1: Existence of the pair $(q, r)$**\n\nLet $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $b \\neq 0$. We wish to show there exists a pair of integers $(q,r)$ such that $a = bq + r$ and $0 \\le r < |b|$. The proof relies on the Well-Ordering Principle.\n\nConsider the set $S$ of non-negative integers defined as:\n$$S = \\{ a - bk \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ and } a - bk \\ge 0 \\}$$\nWe must first establish that $S$ is a non-empty subset of the non-negative integers. We analyze two cases based on the sign of $b$.\n\nCase 1: $b > 0$.\nWe need to find an integer $k$ such that $a - bk \\ge 0$. Choose $k = -|a|$. Then $a - bk = a - b(-|a|) = a + b|a|$. Since $b \\ge 1$, $b|a| \\ge |a|$. Thus, $a+b|a| \\ge a+|a| \\ge 0$. So $a - bk \\ge 0$, and $S$ is non-empty.\n\nCase 2: $b < 0$.\nWe need to find an integer $k$ such that $a - bk \\ge 0$. Choose $k = |a|$. Then $a - bk = a - b|a| = a + (-b)|a|$. Since $b \\le -1$, we have $-b \\ge 1$. Thus, $a+(-b)|a| \\ge a+|a| \\ge 0$. So $a - bk \\ge 0$, and $S$ is non-empty.\n\nSince $S$ is a non-empty set of non-negative integers, the Well-Ordering Principle states that $S$ must contain a least element. Let us call this least element $r$.\nBy definition of $S$, two conditions on $r$ must be met:\n1. $r \\ge 0$.\n2. There exists an integer, which we will call $q$, such that $r = a - bq$. This can be rewritten as $a = bq + r$.\n\nNow, we must show that $r < |b|$. We will prove this by contradiction. Assume that $r \\ge |b|$.\nConsider the integer $r' = r - |b|$. Since we assumed $r \\ge |b|$, it follows that $r' \\ge 0$.\nLet's show that $r'$ is also an element of $S$.\nIf $b > 0$, then $|b| = b$. We have $r' = r - b = (a - bq) - b = a - b(q+1)$. Since $q+1$ is an integer, $r'$ is of the form $a - bk$.\nIf $b < 0$, then $|b| = -b$. We have $r' = r - (-b) = r+b = (a - bq) + b = a - b(q-1)$. Since $q-1$ is an integer, $r'$ is of the form $a - bk$.\nIn both cases, $r'$ is an element of $S$ because it is non-negative and has the required form.\n\nSince $b \\neq 0$, we have $|b| > 0$. Therefore, $r' = r - |b| < r$.\nThis means we have found an element $r' \\in S$ that is strictly smaller than $r$. This contradicts the fact that $r$ is the *least* element of $S$.\nOur initial assumption, $r \\ge |b|$, must be false. Therefore, we must have $r < |b|$.\nCombining our results, we have constructed a pair $(q, r) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a = bq + r$ and $0 \\le r < |b|$. This completes the existence proof.\n\n**Part 2: Uniqueness of the pair $(q, r)$**\n\nSuppose there exist two pairs of integers, $(q_1, r_1)$ and $(q_2, r_2)$, that satisfy the given conditions.\nThen we have:\n1. $a = bq_1 + r_1$, with $0 \\le r_1 < |b|$\n2. $a = bq_2 + r_2$, with $0 \\le r_2 < |b|$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $a$, we get:\n$bq_1 + r_1 = bq_2 + r_2$\nRearranging the terms, we find:\n$b(q_1 - q_2) = r_2 - r_1$\n\nFrom the inequalities on the remainders, we have $0 \\le r_1 < |b|$ and $0 \\le r_2 < |b|$.\nFrom $0 \\le r_1 < |b|$, we have $-|b| < -r_1 \\le 0$.\nAdding this to $0 \\le r_2 < |b|$, we get:\n$0 - |b| < r_2 - r_1 < |b| + 0$\nSo, $-|b| < r_2 - r_1 < |b|$, which is equivalent to $|r_2 - r_1| < |b|$.\n\nNow substitute back into our equation $b(q_1 - q_2) = r_2 - r_1$. Taking the absolute value of both sides gives:\n$|b(q_1 - q_2)| = |r_2 - r_1|$\n$|b| |q_1 - q_2| = |r_2 - r_1|$\n\nCombining this with our inequality for the difference of remainders:\n$|b| |q_1 - q_2| < |b|$\n\nSince $b \\neq 0$, we have $|b| \\ge 1$. We can divide the inequality by $|b|$:\n$|q_1 - q_2| < 1$\n\nSince $q_1$ and $q_2$ are integers, their difference $q_1 - q_2$ must also be an integer. The only integer whose absolute value is strictly less than $1$ is $0$.\nTherefore, $|q_1 - q_2| = 0$, which implies $q_1 - q_2 = 0$, or $q_1 = q_2$.\n\nFinally, substituting $q_1 = q_2$ back into the equation $b(q_1 - q_2) = r_2 - r_1$:\n$b(0) = r_2 - r_1$\n$0 = r_2 - r_1$, which implies $r_1 = r_2$.\n\nSince $q_1=q_2$ and $r_1=r_2$, the pair $(q,r)$ is unique.\n\n**Part 3: Determination of $(q_{-}, r_{-})$**\n\nWe have established the existence of a unique pair $(q,r) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ for the division of $a$ by $b$ such that:\n(1) $a = bq + r$, with $0 \\le r < |b|$\n\nThe problem asks us to find the unique pair $(q_{-}, r_{-}) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ for the division of $a$ by $-b$. This pair must satisfy:\n(2) $a = (-b)q_{-} + r_{-}$, with $0 \\le r_{-} < |-b|$\n\nNote that $|-b|=|b|$, so the condition on the remainder $r_{-}$ is $0 \\le r_{-} < |b|$.\n\nLet's manipulate equation (1) to match the form of equation (2):\n$a = bq + r = (-1)(-1)bq + r = (-b)(-q) + r$\n\nWe have now expressed $a$ in the form $a = (-b)Q + R$, where the candidate quotient is $Q = -q$ and the candidate remainder is $R = r$. Let's check if this candidate pair satisfies the condition on the remainder for division by $-b$. The condition is $0 \\le R < |-b|$.\nSubstituting our candidate $R=r$, we need to check if $0 \\le r < |b|$. This is true by the initial definition of $r$ in equation (1).\n\nSo, the pair $(Q, R) = (-q, r)$ satisfies the two conditions for the division of $a$ by $-b$:\n- $a = (-b)(-q) + r$\n- $0 \\le r < |-b|$\n\nFrom Part 2, we know that such a pair is unique. The problem designates this unique pair as $(q_{-}, r_{-})$. Therefore, we must have:\n$q_{-} = -q$\n$r_{-} = r$\n\nThe unique pair $(q_{-}, r_{-})$ is thus $(-q, r)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -q & r \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3012452"}, {"introduction": "Having solidified the foundation of the standard Division Algorithm, we now explore a seemingly plausible modification.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem defines a modified division algorithm where the quotient $q^{\\star}$ is found using the nearest integer function, $\\operatorname{nint}(x)$, and the remainder is $r^{\\star} = a - b q^{\\star}$. The nearest integer function, $\\operatorname{nint}(x)$, for an argument $x$, returns the integer $m$ that minimizes the distance $|x-m|$. In cases where $x$ is exactly halfway between two integers, i.e., $x = k + 1/2$ for some integer $k$, the tie is broken by choosing the even integer. We are given integers $a$ and $b$ with $b \\neq 0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the general range for the modified remainder $r^{\\star}$. By the definition of the nearest integer function, the distance from any real number $x$ to $\\operatorname{nint}(x)$ is at most $1/2$.\n$$ |x - \\operatorname{nint}(x)| \\leq \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSubstituting $x = a/b$ and $q^{\\star} = \\operatorname{nint}(a/b)$, we have:\n$$ \\left|\\frac{a}{b} - q^{\\star}\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2} $$\nMultiplying this inequality by $|b|$, which is a positive value since $b \\neq 0$:\n$$ |b| \\left|\\frac{a - b q^{\\star}}{b}\\right| \\leq \\frac{|b|}{2} $$\n$$ |b| \\frac{|a - b q^{\\star}|}{|b|} \\leq \\frac{|b|}{2} $$\nSimplifying, and using the definition $r^{\\star} = a - b q^{\\star}$, we get:\n$$ |r^{\\star}| \\leq \\frac{|b|}{2} $$\nThis implies that $-|b|/2 \\leq r^{\\star} \\leq |b|/2$. For any integer $b$ with $|b| \\geq 2$, this range includes negative values. Any negative remainder $r^{\\star}$ will fail to lie in the range $[0, |b|)$ specified by the standard division algorithm, thus proving the existence requested in the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we address the first task for a given odd integer $b \\geq 3$. We seek the least positive integer $a_b$ for which the modified remainder $r^{\\star}(a_b, b)$ is negative.\nThe condition $r^{\\star} < 0$ means $a - b q^{\\star} < 0$, which implies $a < b q^{\\star}$. Substituting $q^{\\star} = \\operatorname{nint}(a/b)$, this becomes $a < b \\operatorname{nint}(a/b)$, or equivalently, $a/b < \\operatorname{nint}(a/b)$. This inequality holds if and only if the nearest integer function rounds the value $a/b$ up to a strictly larger integer.\n\nFor a value $y$, $\\operatorname{nint}(y)$ rounds up if $y$ falls into an interval of the form $(k + 1/2, k+1]$ for some integer $k$. The tie-breaking rule for $y=k+1/2$ would select the even integer between $k$ and $k+1$, so rounding up occurs for $y \\in (k+1/2, k+1]$ if $k+1$ is even, and for $y \\in [k+1/2, k+1]$ if $k$ is even. A simpler condition that always guarantees rounding up is for $y$ to be in the open interval $(k+1/2, k+1)$.\n\nTo find the least positive integer $a$, we should find the smallest positive value of the ratio $a/b$ that is rounded up. This corresponds to setting $k=0$ and examining the interval $(1/2, 1)$. We seek the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $1/2 < a/b < 1$.\nSince $b$ is positive ($b \\geq 3$), we can multiply by $b$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$ \\frac{b}{2} < a < b $$\nThe problem states that $b$ is an odd integer, so we can write $b = 2m+1$ for some integer $m \\geq 1$ (since $b \\geq 3$). The inequality for $a$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{2m+1}{2} < a < 2m+1 $$\n$$ m + \\frac{1}{2} < a < 2m+1 $$\nSince $a$ must be an integer, the smallest integer $a$ satisfying this condition is $a = m+1$.\nTo express this in terms of $b$, we use $m = (b-1)/2$. Thus, the least positive integer $a_b$ is:\n$$ a_b = m+1 = \\frac{b-1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{b+1}{2} $$\nSince $b$ is odd, $b+1$ is an even integer, so $a_b$ is an integer. For $b \\geq 3$, $a_b \\geq (3+1)/2 = 2$, so $a_b$ is a positive integer.\n\nNow, we compute the remainder $r^{\\star}(a_b, b)$ for this $a_b$.\nFirst, we find the quotient $q^{\\star} = \\operatorname{nint}(a_b/b)$. The ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{a_b}{b} = \\frac{(b+1)/2}{b} = \\frac{b+1}{2b} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2b} $$\nSince $b \\geq 3$, we have $0 < 1/(2b) \\leq 1/6$. This implies $1/2 < a_b/b \\leq 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3$. The value of $a_b/b$ is strictly between $1/2$ and $1$. The integers nearest to $a_b/b$ are $0$ and $1$.\nThe distance to $1$ is $|1 - (1/2 + 1/(2b))| = |1/2 - 1/(2b)| = (b-1)/(2b)$.\nThe distance to $0$ is $|(1/2 + 1/(2b)) - 0| = (b+1)/(2b)$.\nSince $b > 0$, we have $b-1 < b+1$, which implies $(b-1)/(2b) < (b+1)/(2b)$. Thus, $a_b/b$ is closer to $1$.\nSince $b$ is odd, $a_b/b$ cannot be of the form $k+1/2$, as this would imply $2a_b = b(2k+1)$, which is impossible because the left side is even and the right side is odd.\nTherefore, the quotient is $q^{\\star} = 1$.\n\nThe closed-form expression for the remainder is:\n$$ r^{\\star}(a_b, b) = a_b - b q^{\\star} = \\frac{b+1}{2} - b(1) = \\frac{b+1-2b}{2} = \\frac{1-b}{2} $$\n\nNow, we address the second task by specializing to $b=1001$.\nThe integer $b=1001$ is odd and greater than $3$, so our derived formula applies.\nThe least positive integer $a_{1001}$ for which $r^{\\star}(a_{1001}, 1001) < 0$ is:\n$$ a_{1001} = \\frac{1001+1}{2} = \\frac{1002}{2} = 501 $$\nThe corresponding modified remainder $r^{\\star}(a_{1001}, 1001)$ is given by our formula:\n$$ r^{\\star}(a_{1001}, 1001) = \\frac{1-1001}{2} = \\frac{-1000}{2} = -500 $$\nTo verify, for $a=501$ and $b=1001$, the ratio is $a/b = 501/1001$. Since $2 \\times 501 = 1002 > 1001$, we have $501/1001 > 1/2$. The distance to $1$ is $|1 - 501/1001| = 500/1001$. The distance to $0$ is $501/1001$. As $500/1001 < 501/1001$, the nearest integer is $1$. So, $q^{\\star}=1$.\nThe remainder is $r^{\\star} = a - bq^{\\star} = 501 - 1001(1) = -500$.\nThe calculation is correct.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-500} $$", "id": "3012447"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus from the properties of a single division to the efficiency of the full Euclidean algorithm.

This perfectly matches the given condition $b=F_n$.\nFor $a=r_0$, we use the recurrence $r_0 = q_1 r_1 + r_2$. With $q_1=1$, we have $a = r_1 + r_2$.\nFrom our construction:\n$r_1 = F_n$.\nTo find $r_2$, we set $n-k=2$, so $k=n-2$. This gives $r_2 = F_{(n-2)+1} = F_{n-1}$.\nSo, $a = r_1 + r_2 = F_n + F_{n-1}$.\nBy the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, $F_n + F_{n-1} = F_{n+1}$.\nThus, $a = F_{n+1}$.\n\nThe pair $(a,b)$ that achieves the maximal number of divisions is $(F_{n+1}, F_n)$.\nLet's verify the number of steps for this pair.\n$r_0 = F_{n+1}$\n$r_1 = F_n$\n$r_0 = F_{n+1} = 1 \\cdot F_n + F_{n-1} \\implies q_1=1, r_2=F_{n-1}$\n$r_1 = F_n = 1 \\cdot F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\implies q_2=1, r_3=F_{n-2}$\n...\nThis continues until we reach the end of the sequence.\n$r_{n-3} = F_4 = 1 \\cdot F_3 + F_2 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\implies q_{n-2}=1, r_{n-1}=F_2=1$.\nThe next step is dividing $r_{n-2}=F_3=2$ by $r_{n-1}=F_2=1$.\n$r_{n-2} = F_3 = 2 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\implies q_{n-1}=2, r_n=0$.\nThe algorithm terminates when the remainder is $0$. The last non-zero remainder is $r_{n-1}=1$.\nThe number of divisions performed is the number of quotients generated, which is $n-1$.\nThis confirms that the pair $(a,b) = (F_{n+1}, F_n)$ yields $t=n-1$ steps, which is the maximum possible. This pair consists of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(a,b) = (F_{n+1}, F_n)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nF_{n+1} & F_{n}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3012454"}]}
