It is a well-posed problem in elementary number theory, specifically regarding the properties of Gaussian integers. The premises are mathematically sound, the terminology is precise, and the required steps constitute a standard algorithm (Hermite's algorithm) for expressing a prime congruent to $1 \\pmod 4$ as a sum of two squares. All given information is self-consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the four steps specified in the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find an integer $a$ with $0<a<p$ such that $a^2\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.**\n\nWe are given the prime $p=97$. We observe that $97 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, which guarantees the existence of an integer $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$. A general method to find such an $a$ for a prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ (and $97 = 12 \\times 8 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$) is to use a quadratic non-residue $n$ and compute $a \\equiv n^{(p-1)/4} \\pmod p$.\n\nLet's test small integers for being a quadratic non-residue modulo $97$ using the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{k}{p}\\right)$.\nFor $k=2$: $\\left(\\frac{2}{97}\\right) = (-1)^{(97^2-1)/8} = (-1)^{(9409-1)/8} = (-1)^{1176} = 1$. So $2$ is a quadratic residue.\nFor $k=3$: By quadratic reciprocity, $\\left(\\frac{3}{97}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{97}{3}\\right)(-1)^{((97-1)/2)((3-1)/2)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(-1)^{48 \\times 1} = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. So $3$ is a quadratic residue.\nFor $k=5$: By quadratic reciprocity, $\\left(\\frac{5}{97}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{97}{5}\\right)(-1)^{((97-1)/2)((5-1)/2)} = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)(-1)^{48 \\times 2} = -1 \\cdot 1 = -1$. So $5$ is a quadratic non-residue.\n\nWe choose $n=5$ and compute $a \\equiv 5^{(p-1)/4} \\pmod{97}$, where $(p-1)/4 = (97-1)/4 = 96/4 = 24$. We need to compute $5^{24} \\pmod{97}$ using modular exponentiation:\n$5^1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{97}$\n$5^2 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{97}$\n$5^4 \\equiv 25^2 = 625 = 6 \\times 97 + 43 \\equiv 43 \\pmod{97}$\n$5^8 \\equiv 43^2 = 1849 = 19 \\times 97 + 6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{97}$\n$5^{16} \\equiv 6^2 = 36 \\pmod{97}$\n$a = 5^{24} = 5^{16} \\cdot 5^8 \\equiv 36 \\cdot 6 = 216 \\pmod{97}$.\n$216 = 2 \\times 97 + 22$, so $216 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{97}$.\nThus, we take $a=22$. We verify this choice:\n$a^2 = 22^2 = 484$.\n$484 = 5 \\times 97 - 1 = 485 - 1$.\nTherefore, $22^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$. The condition $0 < 22 < 97$ is satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Euclidean algorithm in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ to compute a greatest common divisor $d$ of $p$ and $a+i$.**\n\nWe need to compute $d = \\text{gcd}(97, 22+i)$ in the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We apply the Euclidean algorithm. Let $z_1 = 97$ and $z_2 = 22+i$.\n\nFirst, we divide $z_1$ by $z_2$:\n$$ \\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{97}{22+i} = \\frac{97(22-i)}{(22+i)(22-i)} = \\frac{97(22-i)}{22^2+1^2} = \\frac{97(22-i)}{484+1} = \\frac{97(22-i)}{485} $$\nSince $485 = 5 \\times 97$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{97(22-i)}{5 \\times 97} = \\frac{22-i}{5} = 4.4 - 0.2i $$\nTo find the quotient $q_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$, we round the real and imaginary parts of this complex number to the nearest integers.\n$q_1 = \\text{round}(4.4) + i \\cdot \\text{round}(-0.2) = 4 + 0i = 4$.\n\nNow we find the first remainder, $r_1 = z_1 - q_1 z_2$:\n$r_1 = 97 - 4(22+i) = 97 - 88 - 4i = 9-4i$.\n\nNext, we divide $z_2$ by $r_1$:\n$$ \\frac{z_2}{r_1} = \\frac{22+i}{9-4i} = \\frac{(22+i)(9+4i)}{(9-4i)(9+4i)} = \\frac{198 + 88i + 9i + 4i^2}{9^2+(-4)^2} = \\frac{198 + 97i - 4}{81+16} = \\frac{194+97i}{97} = 2+i $$\nThe division is exact. The quotient is $q_2 = 2+i$, which is a Gaussian integer. The remainder $r_2$ is $0$.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm terminates. The greatest common divisor $d$ is the last non-zero remainder, which is $r_1$.\n$d = \\text{gcd}(97, 22+i) = 9-4i$.\n\n**Step 3: Justify that $N(d)=p$ and hence $p=x^2+y^2$.**\n\nLet $d = \\text{gcd}(p, a+i)$. By the properties of the greatest common divisor in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$:\n1. $d$ divides $p$. This implies that the norm of $d$, $N(d)$, must divide the norm of $p$, $N(p)$.\n$N(p)=N(p+0i)=p^2+0^2=p^2$. So, $N(d)$ must be a divisor of $p^2$. Since $p=97$ is a prime number, the integer divisors of $p^2$ are $1$, $p$, and $p^2$. Thus, $N(d) \\in \\{1, p, p^2\\}$.\n\n2. $d$ also divides $a+i$. This implies that $N(d)$ divides $N(a+i)$.\n$N(a+i) = a^2+1$. From Step 1, we know $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, which means $a^2+1$ is a multiple of $p$. Let $a^2+1 = kp$ for some integer $k$. In our case, $a=22$, so $a^2+1 = 22^2+1 = 485 = 5 \\times 97$. So $N(a+i) = 5p$.\nThus, $N(d)$ must divide $5p$.\n\nCombining these two facts, $N(d)$ must be a common divisor of $p^2$ and $5p$. The greatest common divisor of $p^2=97^2$ and $5p=5 \\times 97$ is $p=97$. The divisors of $p$ are $1$ and $p$. Therefore, $N(d)$ must be either $1$ or $p$.\n\nWe now rule out the case $N(d)=1$.\nIf $N(d)=1$, then $d$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This would mean that $p$ and $a+i$ are coprime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. However, we know $p$ divides $a^2+1 = (a+i)(a-i)$. If $p$ were a prime element in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, primality would require $p$ to divide either $a+i$ or $a-i$.\nIf $p | (a+i)$, then $a+i = p(x+yi) = px+pyi$ for some integers $x,y$. Equating imaginary parts gives $1 = py$, which is impossible for an integer $y$ since $p=97$. A similar argument shows $p$ cannot divide $a-i$.\nSince $p$ divides the product $(a+i)(a-i)$ but does not divide either factor, $p$ is not a prime element in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain, this means $p$ is reducible.\nAs $p$ is reducible, it has a non-unit factor, say $\\pi$. This factor $\\pi$ must divide one of $(a+i)$ or $(a-i)$. Thus, $p$ and $a+i$ share a common non-unit factor, so their GCD cannot be a unit. This rules out $N(d)=1$.\n\nThe only remaining possibility for the norm of the GCD is $N(d)=p$.\nLet $d = x+yi$ for some integers $x,y$. Then $N(d) = x^2+y^2$.\nTherefore, we have demonstrated that $p = x^2+y^2$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the unique ordered pair $(x,y)$ with $x\\ge y\\ge 0$ produced by this method.**\n\nFrom Step 2, we computed a GCD as $d = 9-4i$.\nWe calculate its norm to verify the result from Step 3:\n$N(d) = N(9-4i) = 9^2 + (-4)^2 = 81 + 16 = 97$.\nThis confirms that $N(d)=p$, as expected.\nThe representation of $p$ as a sum of two squares is given by the real and imaginary parts of $d$.\n$p = x^2+y^2$, where $x=9$ and $y=-4$.\nThe problem asks for a unique ordered pair $(x,y)$ with the constraints $x\\ge y\\ge 0$. This requires us to take the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts of our GCD, which are $|9|=9$ and $|-4|=4$.\nWe then order these non-negative values such that $x \\ge y$.\nThis yields $x=9$ and $y=4$.\nThe unique ordered pair satisfying the conditions is $(9,4)$.\nWe can check that $9 \\ge 4 \\ge 0$ and $9^2+4^2=81+16=97$.\nAny other GCD found through a different sequence of choices in the Euclidean algorithm will be an associate of $d=9-4i$ (e.g., $4+9i$, $-9+4i$, $-4-9i$). In all cases, the absolute values of the components will be the set $\\{4, 9\\}$, which upon ordering according to $x \\ge y \\ge 0$ yields the same unique pair $(9,4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3021535"}, {"introduction": "While computing directly in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is theoretically elegant, algorithms that operate purely on integers are often more computationally convenient.

It is a well-posed problem in number theory based on established principles. We will proceed in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Finding an integer $t$ with $t^{2}\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$\n\nLet $p=2017$. We are given that this is a prime number and $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, which is correct as $2017 = 4 \\times 504 + 1$. Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares guarantees that such a prime can be written uniquely as the sum of two squares. By inspection or a simple search, we find this representation:\n$$\n2017 = 9^2 + 44^2 = 81 + 1936\n$$\nAs will be justified in Part 3, the existence of such a representation $p=x^2+y^2$ is intrinsically linked to the factorization of $p$ in the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ as $p=(x+yi)(x-yi)$. This factorization, in turn, is connected to the existence of an integer $t$ such that $t^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. Specifically, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $p$ and $t+i$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ will be one of the factors, $x+yi$ or $x-yi$ (up to multiplication by units $\\pm 1, \\pm i$).\n\nLet's assume the GCD is an associate of $\\pi = 44+9i$. For this to be the GCD of $p$ and $t+i$, $t+i$ must be a multiple of $\\pi$. That is, $t+i = \\gamma \\cdot \\pi$ for some $\\gamma = a+bi \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n$$\nt+i = (a+bi)(44+9i) = (44a - 9b) + i(9a+44b)\n$$\nEquating the imaginary parts, we must have $9a+44b=1$. This is a linear Diophantine equation. We can solve it using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n44 &= 4 \\times 9 + 8 \\\\\n9 &= 1 \\times 8 + 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWorking backwards:\n$$\n1 = 9 - 1 \\times 8 = 9 - 1 \\times (44 - 4 \\times 9) = 9 - 44 + 4 \\times 9 = 5 \\times 9 - 1 \\times 44\n$$\nSo we have a solution $a=5$ and $b=-1$. Substituting these values into the expression for the real part gives $t$:\n$$\nt = 44a - 9b = 44(5) - 9(-1) = 220 + 9 = 229\n$$\nSo, we have found a candidate $t=229$. We must now verify that it satisfies $t^{2}\\equiv -1 \\pmod{2017}$.\n$$\n229^2 = 52441\n$$\nTo find the remainder modulo $2017$, we perform division:\n$$\n52441 = 25 \\times 2017 + 2016\n$$\nSince $2016 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2017}$, we have successfully verified our claim:\n$$\n229^2 \\equiv 2016 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2017}\n$$\nThus, an explicit integer $t$ is $t=229$.\n\n### Part 2: Cornacchia’s algorithm\n\nCornacchia's algorithm uses the integer $t=229$ found in Part 1 to find integers $x,y \\ge 0$ such that $x^2+y^2=p$. The algorithm involves applying the Euclidean algorithm to the pair $(p, t)$ and stopping at the first remainder that is less than $\\sqrt{p}$.\n\nGiven $p=2017$ and $t=229$. We note that $\\sqrt{2017} \\approx 44.9$.\nLet $r_0 = p = 2017$ and $r_1 = t = 229$.\nThe steps of the Euclidean algorithm are:\n$$\nr_0 = q_1 r_1 + r_2 \\implies 2017 = 8 \\times 229 + 185\n$$\nThe first remainder is $r_2=185$. Since $185 > 44.9$, we continue.\n$$\nr_1 = q_2 r_2 + r_3 \\implies 229 = 1 \\times 185 + 44\n$$\nThe next remainder is $r_3=44$. Since $44 < 44.9$, we stop here.\nThe algorithm suggests setting one of the numbers, say $x$, to this remainder:\n$$\nx = r_3 = 44\n$$\nThe other number, $y$, is found by computing:\n$$\ny^2 = p - x^2 = 2017 - 44^2 = 2017 - 1936 = 81\n$$\nTaking the positive square root, we find:\n$$\ny = \\sqrt{81} = 9\n$$\nThis gives the pair $(x,y)=(44,9)$. The problem requires the representation with $x \\le y$, so we order them as $(9, 44)$.\n\nTo verify the result, we compute the sum of squares:\n$$\n9^2 + 44^2 = 81 + 1936 = 2017\n$$\nThis matches the prime $p$, so the pair $(x,y)=(9,44)$ is the correct representation.\n\n### Part 3: Justification of the algorithm's correctness\n\nThe correctness of Cornacchia's algorithm stems from the properties of the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The logic can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  **Factorization of $p$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$**: A prime $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is also a prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ if and only if $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Since our prime is $p=2017 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, it is not a prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. It must factor into two prime elements in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The norm of $p$ as a Gaussian integer is $N(p) = p^2$. If $p=\\pi_1 \\pi_2 \\dots \\pi_k$ is its factorization, then $N(p) = p^2 = N(\\pi_1)N(\\pi_2)\\dots N(\\pi_k)$. The problem statement gives that for a non-unit factor $\\pi$ of $p$, its norm $N(\\pi)$ can be $p$ or $p^2$. If $N(\\pi)=p^2$, then $\\pi$ is an associate of $p$, meaning $p$ would be prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, a contradiction. Thus, any prime factor $\\pi$ of $p$ must have norm $p$. The factorization must be of the form $p = \\pi \\bar{\\pi}$ (up to units), where $\\pi=x+yi$ is a Gaussian prime and $N(\\pi) = x^2+y^2=p$.\n\n2.  **Connection to $t^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$**: The condition $t^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ means $t^2+1$ is a multiple of $p$, i.e., $t^2+1=kp$ for some integer $k$. In $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, this equation is $(t+i)(t-i) = kp$. Since $p=\\pi\\bar{\\pi}$, we have $(t+i)(t-i) = k\\pi\\bar{\\pi}$. This means $\\pi$ must divide either $(t+i)$ or $(t-i)$, because $\\pi$ is a prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n    - If $\\pi | (t+i)$, then $\\pi$ is a common divisor of $p$ (since $\\pi|p$) and $t+i$.\n    - If $\\pi | (t-i)$, then by taking the conjugate, $\\bar{\\pi} | \\overline{(t-i)} = t+i$. So $\\bar{\\pi}$ is a common divisor of $p$ (since $\\bar{\\pi}|\\bar{p}=p$) and $t+i$.\n    In either case, one of the prime factors of $p$, either $\\pi$ or $\\bar{\\pi}$, must divide $t+i$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $p$ and $t+i$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, let's call it $\\pi_0 = \\gcd(p, t+i)$, must be an associate of $\\pi$ or $\\bar{\\pi}$. Its norm must be $N(\\pi_0) = N(\\pi) = p$.\n\n3.  **Connection to the Euclidean Algorithm**: Let $\\pi_0 = \\gcd(p, t+i) = x+yi$, where we now know $x^2+y^2=p$. Cornacchia's algorithm is essentially a way to extract the integers $x$ and $y$ from this GCD relationship using only integer arithmetic.\n    The Euclidean algorithm on integers $p$ and $t$ generates a sequence of remainders $r_k$ which are integer linear combinations of $p$ and $t$: $r_k = u_k p + v_k t$.\n    In $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, since $\\pi_0 | p$ and $\\pi_0 | t+i$, we can write these relations as congruences modulo $\\pi_0$:\n    $$\n    p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\pi_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t+i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\pi_0} \\implies t \\equiv -i \\pmod{\\pi_0}\n    $$\n    Now consider the remainder $r_k$ from the integer Euclidean algorithm, modulo $\\pi_0$:\n    $$\n    r_k = u_k p + v_k t \\equiv u_k(0) + v_k(-i) \\equiv -iv_k \\pmod{\\pi_0}\n    $$\n    The algorithm stops at the first remainder $r_k$ such that $r_k < \\sqrt{p}$. Let's call this remainder $x'$. So we have $x' \\equiv -iv \\pmod{\\pi_0}$ for some integer $v$ coming from the extended Euclidean algorithm. This implies that $x'$ is congruent to a pure imaginary number modulo $\\pi_0=x+yi$.\n    Cornacchia's algorithm identifies this $x'$ as one of the components (say, $x$) of the desired pair $(x,y)$. And it finds the other component $y$ as $y=\\sqrt{p-x'^2}$. The theorem underpinning the algorithm guarantees that for a correct choice of $t$, this $y$ will be an integer. In our case, the algorithm yielded $(44,9)$. The GCD in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ for $t=229$ is an associate of $44+9i$ or $44-9i$. The real and imaginary parts, $44$ and $9$, are precisely the pair $(x,y)$ produced by Cornacchia's algorithm, up to order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n9 & 44\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3021527"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered finding representations for primes, the a logical next step is to address composite numbers.

Composite $n$ is $325$.\n- Case $3$ (impossible due to a prime congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ with odd exponent): factors $[\\mathrm{None\\ for\\ }(3,1),(1,2)]$, representing $3^1$ (non-representable) and $5$. Composite $n$ is $15$; the program must output $\\mathrm{False}$.\n- Case $4$ (includes the prime $2$): factors $[(1,1),(1,2),(2,3)]$, representing $2$, $5$, and $13$. Composite $n$ is $130$.\n- Case $5$ (two distinct primes): factors $[(2,3),(1,4)]$, representing $13$ and $17$.

For example, an output of the form $[[x_1,y_1],\\mathrm{False},[x_3,y_3],\\dots]$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of number theory, specifically concerning the properties of the ring of Gaussian integers. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary definitions, conditions, and constraints provided for the construction of a unique, deterministic solution. It is expressed in objective, formal language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims. We may therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in expressing an integer $n$ as a sum of two squares, $n=x^2+y^2$. This is intrinsically linked to the algebraic structure of the ring of Gaussian integers, denoted by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\n**1. Theoretical Foundation: The Ring of Gaussian Integers**\n\nThe ring of Gaussian integers is the set $\\mathbb{Z}[i] = \\{a+bi \\mid a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit satisfying $i^2 = -1$. For any element $\\alpha = a+bi \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$, its norm is defined as:\n$$N(\\alpha) = N(a+bi) = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2+b^2$$\nThe norm is a non-negative integer. An integer $n$ can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if it is the norm of some Gaussian integer. That is, $n = x^2+y^2$ for integers $x, y$ is equivalent to $n = N(x+yi)$.\n\nThe problem requires deriving the composition of sums of two squares from the properties of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The key property is that the norm is multiplicative. Let $\\alpha = a+bi$ and $\\beta = c+di$ be two Gaussian integers. Their product in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is:\n$$\\alpha\\beta = (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i$$\nThe norm of this product is:\n$$N(\\alpha\\beta) = N((ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i) = (ac-bd)^2 + (ad+bc)^2$$\nExpanding this expression:\n$$(ac-bd)^2 + (ad+bc)^2 = (a^2c^2 - 2abcd + b^2d^2) + (a^2d^2 + 2abcd + b^2c^2)$$\n$$= a^2c^2 + b^2d^2 + a^2d^2 + b^2c^2 = a^2(c^2+d^2) + b^2(c^2+d^2) = (a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)$$\nThis demonstrates that $N(\\alpha\\beta) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$. This result is a restatement of the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity. It shows that if two integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ are sums of two squares, their product $n_1n_2$ is also a sum of two squares.\n\n**2. Algorithmic Strategy for Composition and Descent**\n\nThe task is to find a representation $(x,y)$ for a composite number $n = \\prod_{j=1}^{m} p_j^{e_j}$ given representations $(a_j, b_j)$ for each factor $n_j = p_j^{e_j}$, where $n_j = a_j^2+b_j^2$. This corresponds to a sequence of Gaussian integers $\\gamma_j = a_j+b_j i$ such that $n_j = N(\\gamma_j)$. The target composite number is $n = \\prod n_j = \\prod N(\\gamma_j) = N(\\prod \\gamma_j)$. Thus, the components of the Gaussian integer product $\\Gamma = \\prod \\gamma_j$ will give a desired representation for $n$.\n\nThe specified \"descent strategy\" requires making a choice at each step of the composition to minimize the larger component of the resulting pair. For any given factor $n_j = a_j^2+b_j^2$, it is the norm of both $\\gamma_j = a_j+b_j i$ and its complex conjugate $\\bar{\\gamma}_j = a_j-b_j i$. This provides two distinct choices for composition at each step.\n\nLet the accumulated product after $k-1$ steps be $\\Pi_{k-1} = u+vi$. The next factor is $n_k=a_k^2+b_k^2$, corresponding to $\\gamma_k=a_k+b_k i$ and $\\bar{\\gamma}_k=a_k-b_k i$. We compute two candidate products for the $k$-th step:\n\n1.  Product with $\\gamma_k$: $\\Pi_A = \\Pi_{k-1} \\cdot \\gamma_k = (u+vi)(a_k+b_k i) = (ua_k - vb_k) + (ub_k + va_k)i$.\n2.  Product with $\\bar{\\gamma}_k$: $\\Pi_B = \\Pi_{k-1} \\cdot \\bar{\\gamma}_k = (u+vi)(a_k-b_k i) = (ua_k + vb_k) + (-ub_k + va_k)i$.\n\nLet $\\Pi_A = X_A + Y_A i$ and $\\Pi_B = X_B + Y_B i$. The descent criterion dictates that we compare the costs $C_A = \\max(|X_A|, |Y_A|)$ and $C_B = \\max(|X_B|, |Y_B|)$ and choose the product with the minimum cost as $\\Pi_k$.\n\nThe problem also mentions \"available associates\". The associates of a Gaussian integer $\\alpha$ are $\\alpha, i\\alpha, -\\alpha, -i\\alpha$. If $\\alpha=X+Yi$, its associates are $X+Yi$, $-Y+Xi$, $-X-Yi$, and $Y-Xi$. The absolute values of the components are merely swapped, i.e., $\\{|X|,|Y|\\}$ becomes $\\{|-Y|,|X|\\} = \\{|Y|,|X|\\}$. Therefore, $\\max(|X|,|Y|)$ is invariant across all associates. The choice of associate does not affect the descent criterion as defined. The crucial choice is between multiplying by $\\gamma_k$ or its conjugate $\\bar{\\gamma}_k$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Algorithm**\n\nThe algorithm for a given test case (a sequence of factors) is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Check the sequence of factors. If any factor is a sentinel for non-representability (e.g., `None`), the composite number is not a sum of two squares. The result for the case is $\\mathrm{False}$.\n2.  If all factors are representable as pairs $(a_j, b_j)$, take the first pair $(a_1, b_1)$ and initialize the current accumulated Gaussian integer as $\\Pi_1 = a_1 + b_1 i$. Let its components be $(u,v) = (a_1,b_1)$.\n3.  **Iteration**: For each subsequent factor $(a_k, b_k)$ from $k=2$ to $m$:\n    a.  Compute the two candidate products:\n        -   $(X_A, Y_A) = (u a_k - v b_k, u b_k + v a_k)$\n        -   $(X_B, Y_B) = (u a_k + v b_k, -u b_k + v a_k)$\n    b.  Calculate their respective costs:\n        -   $C_A = \\max(|X_A|, |Y_A|)$\n        -   $C_B = \\max(|X_B|, |Y_B|)$\n    c.  Apply the descent rule: If $C_A \\le C_B$, update $(u,v) = (X_A, Y_A)$. Otherwise, update $(u,v) = (X_B, Y_B)$. In case of a tie, this rule provides a deterministic choice.\n4.  **Finalization**: After iterating through all factors, the final accumulated components are $(u,v)$. The problem requires the output pair $(x,y)$ to be normalized such that $x \\ge 0$, $y \\ge 0$, and $x \\le y$. This is achieved by:\n    $$x = \\min(|u|, |v|)$$\n    $$y = \\max(|u|, |v|)$$\n5.  The result for the test case is the pair $[x,y]$.\n\n**4. Impossibility Condition**\n\nFermat's theorem on sums of two squares, generalized by Legendre, states that a positive integer $n$ can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if the prime factorization of $n$ contains no prime $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ raised to an odd power. The sentinel `None` in the input for a factor like $3^1$ signifies that this condition is violated. Consequently, the entire composite number $n$ cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares.\n\n**Example: Case 4: factors $[(1,1),(1,2),(2,3)]$, $n=130$**\n\n1.  **Initialize**: The factors are all valid pairs. Start with the first factor $(1,1)$. The current accumulated Gaussian integer is $\\Pi_1 = 1+1i$. So, $(u,v)=(1,1)$.\n2.  **Step 2**: Compose with the second factor, $(1,2)$, corresponding to $\\gamma_2=1+2i$.\n    -   Current $(u,v)=(1,1)$. New factor $(a_2,b_2)=(1,2)$.\n    -   Candidate A: $(1\\cdot1 - 1\\cdot2, 1\\cdot2 + 1\\cdot1) = (-1, 3)$. Cost $C_A = \\max(|-1|,|3|) = 3$.\n    -   Candidate B: $(1\\cdot1 + 1\\cdot2, -1\\cdot2 + 1\\cdot1) = (3, -1)$. Cost $C_B = \\max(|3|,|-1|) = 3$.\n    -   The costs are tied ($3 \\le 3$). We select Candidate A. The accumulated product becomes $\\Pi_2 = -1+3i$. New $(u,v)=(-1,3)$.\n3.  **Step 3**: Compose with the third factor, $(2,3)$, corresponding to $\\gamma_3=2+3i$.\n    -   Current $(u,v)=(-1,3)$. New factor $(a_3,b_3)=(2,3)$.\n    -   Candidate A: $(-1\\cdot2 - 3\\cdot3, -1\\cdot3 + 3\\cdot2) = (-11, 3)$. Cost $C_A = \\max(|-11|,|3|) = 11$.\n    -   Candidate B: $(-1\\cdot2 + 3\\cdot3, -(-1)\\cdot3 + 3\\cdot2) = (7, 9)$. Cost $C_B = \\max(|7|,|9|) = 9$.\n    -   Since $C_B < C_A$ ($9 < 11$), we select Candidate B. The final accumulated product is $\\Pi_3 = 7+9i$. Final $(u,v)=(7,9)$.\n4.  **Finalization**: Normalize $(7,9)$.\n    -   $x = \\min(|7|,|9|) = 7$.\n    -   $y = \\max(|7|,|9|) = 9$.\n    -   The result for this case is $[7,9]$. We verify $7^2+9^2 = 49+81 = 130$.\n\nThis systematic procedure, derived from the multiplicative structure of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, correctly implements the required algorithm.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n# from scipy import ...\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a series of problems on representing a composite integer n as a sum\n    of two squares, x^2 + y^2.
