It is grounded in established principles of number theory, including properties of modular arithmetic, cyclic groups, prime numbers, and perfect numbers. The premises are factually correct mathematical theorems. The tasks are logically sequenced and lead to a unique, verifiable solution. The integer $n=2^{11}-1$ is a concrete object for study. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or non-scientific claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe are given the integer $n = 2^{11}-1$. The problem is divided into four parts, which we will address sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Order of $2$ modulo a prime divisor of $n$**\n\nLet $p$ be an odd prime divisor of $n = 2^{11}-1$. The statement that $p$ divides $n$ is equivalent to the congruence $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, which means $2^{11}-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, or $2^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThe multiplicative order of an element $a$ modulo $m$, denoted $\\text{ord}_m(a)$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. Here, we are interested in $\\text{ord}_p(2)$. Let $d = \\text{ord}_p(2)$. By definition, $d$ is the smallest positive integer such that $2^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nA fundamental property of order states that if $2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for some positive integer $k$, then the order $d$ must divide $k$. In our case, since $2^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, it follows that $d$ must be a divisor of $11$.\n\nThe number $11$ is a prime number, so its only positive divisors are $1$ and $11$. Thus, $d$ must be either $1$ or $11$.\n- If $d=1$, then $2^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. This implies that $p$ divides $2-1=1$, which is impossible for a prime number $p$.\n- Therefore, the only possibility is $d=11$. The multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $p$ is exactly $11$.\n\nNext, we use this fact to constrain $p$. The set of integers relatively prime to $p$ forms a multiplicative group modulo $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $\\varphi(p) = p-1$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer $a$ not divisible by the prime $p$, we have $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, it does not divide $2$, so we have $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nFrom the property of order, since $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2$ modulo $p$, which is $11$, must divide the exponent $p-1$.\nThe statement that $11$ divides $p-1$ is equivalent to the congruence $p-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, or $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Part 2: Prime factorization of $n$**\n\nWe need to find the prime factors of $n = 2^{11}-1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047$.\nFrom Part 1, we know that any prime factor $p$ of $n$ must satisfy the congruence $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nWe search for prime numbers of the form $p = 11k+1$ for some positive integer $k$.\n- For $k=1$, we get $p = 11(1)+1 = 12$, which is not prime.\n- For $k=2$, we get $p = 11(2)+1 = 23$, which is a prime number. Let's test if $23$ is a divisor of $2047$.\n$$ \\frac{2047}{23} = 89 $$\nThe division is exact. We find that $2047 = 23 \\times 89$.\nWe must verify that both factors are prime. $23$ is prime. For $89$, we check for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{89} \\approx 9.4$. The primes to check are $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.\n- $89$ is not divisible by $2$ (it is odd).\n- The sum of digits is $8+9=17$, which is not divisible by $3$, so $89$ is not divisible by $3$.\n- $89$ does not end in $0$ or $5$, so it is not divisible by $5$.\n- $89 = 12 \\times 7 + 5$, so $89$ is not divisible by $7$.\nSince $89$ has no prime factors less than or equal to its square root, $89$ is a prime number. We also check if it satisfies the congruence: $89 = 8 \\times 11 + 1$, so $89 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nThe complete prime factorization of $n$ is $n = 23 \\times 89$.\n\n**Part 3: Implication for the Euclid–Euler theorem**\n\nThe Euclid–Euler theorem provides a one-to-one correspondence between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes. An even number is perfect if and only if it has the form $2^{k-1}(2^k-1)$, where $2^k-1$ is a prime number. The number $2^k-1$ is called a Mersenne number and is denoted $M_k$. If $M_k$ is prime, it is a Mersenne prime.\n\nThe problem requires us to consider the case where the exponent is $k=11$. This corresponds to the number $N = 2^{11-1}(2^{11}-1) = 2^{10}(2^{11}-1)$. For $N$ to be a perfect number, the Mersenne number $M_{11} = 2^{11}-1$ would need to be a Mersenne prime.\n\nHowever, in Part 2, we found the prime factorization of this number: $2^{11}-1 = 2047 = 23 \\times 89$. Since $2^{11}-1$ is a composite number and not a prime, it is not a Mersenne prime.\nThe implication is that the condition for the Euclid–Euler theorem is not met for the exponent $k=11$. Consequently, the number $N = 2^{10}(2^{11}-1) = 1024 \\times 2047 = 2096128$ is not a perfect number.\n\n**Part 4: Computation of $\\varphi(n)$**\n\nWe need to compute Euler's totient function, $\\varphi(n)$, for $n=2047$. The totient function $\\varphi(m)$ counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer $m$ that are relatively prime to $m$.\nWe have the prime factorization $n = 23 \\times 89$.\nA key property of Euler's totient function is that it is multiplicative. That is, if $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $\\varphi(ab) = \\varphi(a)\\varphi(b)$.\nSince $23$ and $89$ are distinct primes, they are relatively prime. Thus,\n$$ \\varphi(2047) = \\varphi(23 \\times 89) = \\varphi(23) \\times \\varphi(89) $$\nFor any prime number $p$, the value of the totient function is $\\varphi(p) = p-1$.\nApplying this formula, we get:\n- $\\varphi(23) = 23 - 1 = 22$\n- $\\varphi(89) = 89 - 1 = 88$\n\nNow, we compute the final product:\n$$ \\varphi(2047) = 22 \\times 88 $$\n$$ \\varphi(2047) = 22 \\times (80 + 8) = 22 \\times 80 + 22 \\times 8 = 1760 + 176 = 1936 $$\nThe exact value of $\\varphi(n)$ is $1936$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1936}$$", "id": "3020907"}, {"introduction": "In mathematics, conjectures drive progress, and their refutation can be as illuminating as their proof.

Specifically, for the case $n=5$, we must exhibit a nontrivial factorization of $F_5 = 2^{2^5} + 1 = 2^{32} + 1$. The derivation must be based on first principles of modular arithmetic, and the complementary factor must be explicitly computed.\n\nFirst, we identify a nontrivial factor $d > 1$ of $F_5$. We must show that $F_5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d}$, which is equivalent to demonstrating the congruence $2^{32} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}$. The factor, discovered by Leonhard Euler, is $d=641$. We will now prove from first principles that $641$ divides $F_5$.\n\nThe integer $641$ can be expressed in two convenient forms:\n1.  $641 = 640 + 1 = 10 \\cdot 64 + 1 = 5 \\cdot 128 + 1 = 5 \\cdot 2^7 + 1$.\n2.  $641 = 625 + 16 = 5^4 + 2^4$.\n\nFrom the first expression, we can establish a congruence involving a power of $2$:\n$$5 \\cdot 2^7 + 1 = 641 \\implies 5 \\cdot 2^7 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{641}$$\nRaising both sides of this congruence to the fourth power, and using the property that if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, then $a^k \\equiv b^k \\pmod{m}$, we get:\n$$(5 \\cdot 2^7)^4 \\equiv (-1)^4 \\pmod{641}$$\n$$5^4 \\cdot (2^7)^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{641}$$\n$$5^4 \\cdot 2^{28} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{641}$$\n\nFrom the second expression for $641$, we establish another congruence:\n$$5^4 + 2^4 = 641 \\implies 5^4 \\equiv -2^4 \\pmod{641}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this second result into the first derived congruence:\n$$(-2^4) \\cdot 2^{28} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{641}$$\n$$-2^{4+28} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{641}$$\n$$-2^{32} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{641}$$\nMultiplying by $-1$, we arrive at the desired congruence:\n$$2^{32} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{641}$$\nThis demonstrates that $2^{32} + 1$ is a multiple of $641$, so $d=641$ is a factor of $F_5$.\n\nNext, we must compute the complementary factor, $c = \\frac{F_5}{d} = \\frac{2^{32}+1}{641}$. This requires integer arithmetic. First, we compute the explicit value of $F_5$.\nWe know that $2^{16} = 65536$. Then $2^{32}$ is the square of this number:\n$$2^{32} = (2^{16})^2 = (65536)^2 = 4294967296$$\nTherefore, the fifth Fermat number is:\n$$F_5 = 2^{32} + 1 = 4294967296 + 1 = 4294967297$$\nNow we perform long division to find the integer quotient $c = \\frac{4294967297}{641}$.\n\nThe steps of the long division are as follows:\n-   $4294 \\div 641 = 6$ with a remainder of $4294 - 6 \\cdot 641 = 4294 - 3846 = 448$.\n-   Bring down the next digit $9$, forming $4489$. $4489 \\div 641 = 7$ with a remainder of $4489 - 7 \\cdot 641 = 4489 - 4487 = 2$.\n-   Bring down the next digit $6$, forming $26$. $26 \\div 641 = 0$ with a remainder of $26$.\n-   Bring down the next digit $7$, forming $267$. $267 \\div 641 = 0$ with a remainder of $267$.\n-   Bring down the next digit $2$, forming $2672$. $2672 \\div 641 = 4$ with a remainder of $2672 - 4 \\cdot 641 = 2672 - 2564 = 108$.\n-   Bring down the next digit $9$, forming $1089$. $1089 \\div 641 = 1$ with a remainder of $1089 - 1 \\cdot 641 = 1089 - 641 = 448$.\n-   Bring down the final digit $7$, forming $4487$. $4487 \\div 641 = 7$ with a remainder of $4487 - 7 \\cdot 641 = 4487 - 4487 = 0$.\n\nThe division is exact, and the quotient, which is the complementary factor $c$, is $6700417$.\n\nThus, we have found the two nontrivial factors of $F_5$: $d=641$ and $c=6700417$.

For a prime power $p^k$, $\\sigma(p^k) = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$.\nSo, $\\sigma(2^{n}) = \\frac{2^{n+1}-1}{2-1} = 2^{n+1}-1$.\n$\\sigma(p) = p+1 = (3 \\cdot 2^{n} - 1) + 1 = 3 \\cdot 2^{n}$.\n$\\sigma(q) = q+1 = (3 \\cdot 2^{n-1} - 1) + 1 = 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\sigma(A)$:\n$\\sigma(A) = (2^{n+1}-1)(3 \\cdot 2^{n})(3 \\cdot 2^{n-1}) = (2^{n+1}-1) \\cdot 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute $\\sigma(B)$:\n$\\sigma(B) = \\sigma(2^{n} r) = \\sigma(2^{n})\\sigma(r)$.\nAssuming $r$ is prime:\n$\\sigma(r) = r+1 = (9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 1) + 1 = 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\sigma(B)$:\n$\\sigma(B) = (2^{n+1}-1)(9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1})$.\n\nSo, under the assumption that $p, q, r$ are prime, we find $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(B) = (2^{n+1}-1) \\cdot 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1}$.\n\nNow we verify if this common value is equal to $A+B$.\n$A+B = 2^{n}pq + 2^{n}r = 2^{n}(pq+r)$.\nLet's compute the term $pq+r$:\n$pq = (3 \\cdot 2^{n} - 1)(3 \\cdot 2^{n-1} - 1)$\n$pq = (3 \\cdot 2^{n})(3 \\cdot 2^{n-1}) - 3 \\cdot 2^{n} - 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1} + 1$\n$pq = 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 3(2 \\cdot 2^{n-1}) - 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1} + 1$\n$pq = 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1}(2+1) + 1$\n$pq = 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 9 \\cdot 2^{n-1} + 1$.\nNow, add $r$:\n$pq+r = (9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 9 \\cdot 2^{n-1} + 1) + (9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 1) = 18 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 9 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$.\nWe can factor out $9 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$:\n$pq+r = 9 \\cdot 2^{n-1}(2 \\cdot 2^{n} - 1) = 9 \\cdot 2^{n-1}(2^{n+1} - 1)$.\nThen, $A+B = 2^{n}(pq+r) = 2^{n} \\cdot 9 \\cdot 2^{n-1}(2^{n+1}-1) = 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1}(2^{n+1}-1)$.\nThis is exactly the expression we found for $\\sigma(A)$ and $\\sigma(B)$.\nThus, $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(B) = A+B$.\n\nThe condition for $(A, B)$ to be an amicable pair is that the three integers $p = 3 \\cdot 2^{n} - 1$, $q = 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1} - 1$, and $r = 9 \\cdot 2^{2n-1} - 1$ are all prime numbers.\n\nNow, we specialize to the case $n=2$.\nFor $n=2$:\n$p = 3 \\cdot 2^{2} - 1 = 3 \\cdot 4 - 1 = 11$.\n$q = 3 \\cdot 2^{2-1} - 1 = 3 \\cdot 2 - 1 = 5$.\n$r = 9 \\cdot 2^{2 \\cdot 2 - 1} - 1 = 9 \\cdot 2^{3} - 1 = 9 \\cdot 8 - 1 = 71$.\n\nNext, we verify the primality of $p, q, r$:\n- $p=11$ is a prime number.\n- $q=5$ is a prime number.\n- $r=71$. To check if $71$ is prime, we test divisibility by primes up to $\\sqrt{71} \\approx 8.4$. The primes to test are $2, 3, 5, 7$.\n  - $71$ is not divisible by $2$ (it is odd).\n  - The sum of its digits is $7+1=8$, which is not divisible by $3$.\n  - It does not end in $0$ or $5$, so it is not divisible by $5$.\n  - $71 = 7 \\cdot 10 + 1$, so it is not divisible by $7$.\n  Therefore, $71$ is a prime number.\n\nSince $p=11$, $q=5$, and $r=71$ are all prime, the conditions for an amicable pair are satisfied for $n=2$.\nWe compute $A$ and $B$ for $n=2$:\n$A = 2^{n} p q = 2^{2} \\cdot 11 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot 55 = 220$.\n$B = 2^{n} r = 2^{2} \\cdot 71 = 4 \\cdot 71 = 284$.\nThe generated amicable pair is $(220, 284)$.\n\nThe final task is to evaluate the quantity $\\sigma(A) - A + \\sigma(B) - B$ for $n=2$.\nThis expression is equivalent to $s(A) + s(B)$.\nSince $(A,B)$ is an amicable pair for $n=2$, we have $s(A) = B$ and $s(B) = A$.\nTherefore, $s(A) + s(B) = B + A$.\nUsing the computed values of $A$ and $B$:\n$A+B = 220 + 284 = 504$.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute $\\sigma(A)$ and $\\sigma(B)$ for $A=220$ and $B=284$.\n$A = 220 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$.\n$\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(2^2) \\sigma(5) \\sigma(11) = (2^3-1)/(2-1) \\cdot (5+1) \\cdot (11+1) = 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 12 = 504$.\n$B = 284 = 2^2 \\cdot 71$.\n$\\sigma(B) = \\sigma(2^2) \\sigma(71) = (2^3-1)/(2-1) \\cdot (71+1) = 7 \\cdot 72 = 504$.\nThe quantity is $\\sigma(A) - A + \\sigma(B) - B = (504 - 220) + (504 - 284) = 284 + 220 = 504$.\nThe result is consistent.\nThe final numerical value is $504$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{504}$$", "id": "3020908"}]}
