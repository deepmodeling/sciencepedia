The function $x - 3$ is a polynomial and is continuous for all real numbers. Therefore, their sum, $h(x) = \\ln(x) + x - 3$, is continuous on the domain $(0, \\infty)$.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$p(-N) \\cdot p(N) < 0$$\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the function at the endpoints $x=N$ and $x=-N$.\nFor $x=N$:\n$$p(N) = N^5 - 8N^4 - 100 = N^4(N - 8) - 100$$\n\nFor $x=-N$:\n$$p(-N) = (-N)^5 - 8(-N)^4 - 100 = -N^5 - 8N^4 - 100$$\nWe can factor out a negative sign:\n$$p(-N) = -(N^5 + 8N^4 + 100)$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the sign of $p(-N)$. Since $N$ is a positive integer, $N \\ge 1$. Consequently, $N^5$, $8N^4$, and $100$ are all positive. Their sum, $N^5 + 8N^4 + 100$, is strictly positive.
