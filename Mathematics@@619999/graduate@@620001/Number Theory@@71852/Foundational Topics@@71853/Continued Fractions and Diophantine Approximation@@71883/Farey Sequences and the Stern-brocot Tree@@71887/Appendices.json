The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and constraints to derive the requested algorithm and its proof of correctness. No contradictions, ambiguities, or falsehoods are present.\n\n### Derivation of the Algorithm and Proof of Correctness\n\nThe objective is to design an algorithm that generates the Farey sequence of order $N$, denoted $F_N$, for a given positive integer $N$. The sequence $F_N$ is the set of irreducible fractions $a/b$ such that $0 \\le a \\le b \\le N$ and $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, sorted in increasing order. The algorithm must be derived from the properties of the Stern-Brocot tree.\n\n**1. The Stern-Brocot Tree and the Mediant Invariant**\n\nThe Stern-Brocot tree, when restricted to the unit interval $[0,1]$, is constructed iteratively starting with the sentinel fractions $0/1$ and $1/1$. Given two adjacent fractions $h_1/k_1$ and $h_2/k_2$ in the construction process, with $h_1/k_1 < h_2/k_2$, their **mediant** is defined as $(h_1+h_2)/(k_1+k_2)$. The mediant lies strictly between its parents: $h_1/k_1 < (h_1+h_2)/(k_1+k_2) < h_2/k_2$. This process can be applied recursively, generating a binary tree of all non-negative rational numbers.\n\nA fundamental property of this construction is the **mediant invariant**. If $h_1/k_1$ and $h_2/k_2$ are adjacent fractions at any step of the generation, they satisfy the relation:\n$$ k_1 h_2 - h_1 k_2 = 1 $$\n\nWe prove this by induction.\n- **Base Case**: The initial fractions are $h_1/k_1 = 0/1$ and $h_2/k_2 = 1/1$. We check: $k_1 h_2 - h_1 k_2 = (1)(1) - (0)(1) = 1$. The property holds.\n- **Inductive Step**: Assume the property holds for an adjacent pair $h_1/k_1$ and $h_2/k_2$, i.e., $k_1 h_2 - h_1 k_2 = 1$. Let their mediant be $h_m/k_m = (h_1+h_2)/(k_1+k_2)$. The mediant splits the interval into two new adjacent pairs: $(h_1/k_1, h_m/k_m)$ and $(h_m/k_m, h_2/k_2)$. We check the invariant for both pairs.\n  - For $(h_1/k_1, h_m/k_m)$:\n    $$ k_1 h_m - h_1 k_m = k_1 (h_1+h_2) - h_1 (k_1+k_2) = k_1 h_1 + k_1 h_2 - h_1 k_1 - h_1 k_2 = k_1 h_2 - h_1 k_2 = 1 $$\n  - For $(h_m/k_m, h_2/k_2)$:\n    $$ k_m h_2 - h_m k_2 = (k_1+k_2) h_2 - (h_1+h_2) k_2 = k_1 h_2 + k_2 h_2 - h_1 k_2 - h_2 k_2 = k_1 h_2 - h_1 k_2 = 1 $$\nThe invariant holds for both new pairs. By induction, it holds for any pair of adjacent fractions generated in the Stern-Brocot tree.\n\nA crucial consequence of this invariant is that every fraction generated is irreducible. If $h/k$ is generated, it is part of an adjacent pair $(h/k, h'/k')$ satisfying $k h' - h k' = 1$. By Bézout's identity, since there exists an integer linear combination of $h$ and $k$ that equals $1$ (namely, $(-k')h + (h')k = 1$), it must be that $\\gcd(h,k)=1$.\n\n**2. The Algorithm: Pruned Traversal of the Stern-Brocot Tree**\n\nThe set of all reduced fractions in $[0,1]$ is precisely the set of nodes in the Stern-Brocot tree between $0/1$ and $1/1$. The Farey sequence $F_N$ is a subset of these fractions, specifically those with denominator $b \\le N$. This suggests that we can generate $F_N$ by traversing the Stern-Brocot tree and collecting only those fractions that satisfy the denominator constraint.\n\nThe algorithm explores the tree using a recursive, depth-first approach. It operates on an interval defined by two adjacent fractions, $[h_1/k_1, h_2/k_2]$.\nThe core idea is to compute the mediant $h_m/k_m = (h_1+h_2)/(k_1+k_2)$ and apply a pruning rule: if the new denominator $k_m = k_1+k_2$ is greater than $N$, we do not explore this branch further, as all subsequent mediants in this branch will have even larger denominators.\n\nThe recursive procedure, `Generate(h1,k1, h2,k2)`, is as follows:\n1. Compute the mediant's numerator $h_m = h_1+h_2$ and denominator $k_m = k_1+k_2$.\n2. **Pruning Rule**: If $k_m > N$, terminate this recursive path.\n3. If $k_m \\le N$:\n   a. Recursively call `Generate(h1,k1, hm,km)` to find all Farey fractions in the left sub-interval.\n   b. Record the mediant fraction $h_m/k_m$.\n   c. Recursively call `Generate(hm,km, h2,k2)` to find all Farey fractions in the right sub-interval.\n\nTo generate the full sequence $F_N$, we start with the endpoints $0/1$ and $1/1$. The sequence is initialized with $0/1$, then the recursive procedure is called as `Generate(0,1, 1,1)`, and finally $1/1$ is appended. This process corresponds to an in-order traversal of the valid subgraph of the Stern-Brocot tree, ensuring the fractions are generated in increasing order.\n\n**3. Proof of Correctness**\n\nWe must prove that this algorithm generates precisely the set $F_N$ in the correct order.\n\n- **Soundness (All generated fractions are in $F_N$)**:\n  Any fraction $h/k$ generated by the algorithm (excluding the initial $0/1$ and $1/1$) is a mediant of two fractions that were themselves generated by the same process. As proven earlier, the mediant construction ensures $\\gcd(h,k)=1$. The recursive algorithm explicitly checks the condition $k \\le N$ before generating $h/k$. By construction, all fractions are in $[0,1]$. Therefore, any generated fraction satisfies all conditions for being in $F_N$.\n\n- **Completeness (All fractions in $F_N$ are generated)**:\n  We prove by induction on the denominator $b$ that any fraction $a/b \\in F_N$ is generated.\n  - **Base Case**: For $b=1$, the fractions are $0/1$ and $1/1$. These are the endpoints of the initial call and are explicitly included in the final sequence.\n  - **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that for all integers $k < b$, any fraction $h/k \\in F_N$ is generated by the algorithm.\n  - **Inductive Step**: Consider any fraction $a/b \\in F_N$ with $b>1$. Every such fraction is a mediant of a unique pair of \"ancestor\" fractions $h_1/k_1$ and $h_2/k_2$ in the Stern-Brocot tree, such that $a = h_1+h_2$ and $b = k_1+k_2$. These ancestors satisfy the invariant $k_1 h_2 - h_1 k_2 = 1$. The fractions $h_1/k_1$ and $h_2/k_2$ are also irreducible and have denominators $k_1 < b$ and $k_2 < b$.\n  Since $k_1 < b \\le N$ and $k_2 < b \\le N$, by the inductive hypothesis, the ancestor fractions $h_1/k_1$ and $h_2/k_2$ (or their own ancestors) must be considered by the algorithm. The algorithm's traversal will eventually lead to a recursive call on the interval $[h_1/k_1, h_2/k_2]$, i.e., `Generate(h1,k1, h2,k2)`.\n  Inside this call, the algorithm computes the mediant, which is exactly $a/b$. The denominator is $b = k_1+k_2$. Since $a/b \\in F_N$, we know $b \\le N$. The pruning condition $b > N$ is false. Thus, the algorithm will proceed to record $a/b$ and recurse further. This shows that $a/b$ is generated.\n  By induction, all fractions in $F_N$ are generated.\n\n- **Uniqueness (Each fraction is generated exactly once)**:\n  The full (unpruned) Stern-Brocot tree has the property that every positive rational number appears exactly once. Our algorithm performs a systematic traversal of this tree, pruning branches. The in-order traversal ensures that each node (fraction) is visited and processed at exactly one point in the execution flow. A fraction $a/b$ is generated only when the algorithm processes the specific interval defined by its unique Stern-Brocot parents. Thus, each fraction in the output is generated exactly once.\n\n- **Order (The output is in strictly increasing order)**:\n  The algorithm's structure is an in-order traversal: recurse left, visit node, recurse right.\n  `Generate(h1,k1, hm,km)` (left subtree) is called before processing $h_m/k_m$.\n  `Generate(hm,km, h2,k2)` (right subtree) is called after processing $h_m/k_m$.\n  The mediant property ensures that for any fraction $x$ in the left subtree and $y$ in the right subtree, $h_1/k_1 \\le x < h_m/k_m < y \\le h_2/k_2$. This is the defining property of a binary search tree, and an in-order traversal of a binary search tree always yields the elements in sorted order.\n  The overall process starts with $0/1$, followed by the sorted results from `Generate(0,1, 1,1)`, and concludes with $1/1$. The final list is therefore complete and strictly ordered.\n\nThe derivation and proof are complete.

Let $x_{i-1}/y_{i-1}$ and $x_i/y_i$ be two consecutive terms in $F_N$. The problem provides two critical properties of such a pair:\n1.  **Unimodularity**: The terms are adjacent in the Stern-Brocot tree, which implies the unimodularity condition $x_i y_{i-1} - y_i x_{i-1} = 1$.\n2.  **Mediant Exclusion**: Their mediant, $(x_{i-1}+x_i)/(y_{i-1}+y_i)$, is not in $F_N$. Since the mediant of an unimodular pair is always irreducible, its exclusion must be due to its denominator being too large, i.e., $y_{i-1}+y_i > N$.\n\nOur goal is to find the next term, $x_{i+1}/y_{i+1}$, given the pair $(x_{i-1}/y_{i-1}, x_i/y_i)$.\n\n### Derivation of the Successor Construction\n\nLet $(x_{i-1}/y_{i-1}, x_i/y_i, x_{i+1}/y_{i+1})$ be three consecutive terms in $F_N$. The unimodularity property must hold for each consecutive pair:\n1.  $x_i y_{i-1} - y_i x_{i-1} = 1$\n2.  $x_{i+1} y_i - y_{i+1} x_i = 1$\n\nWe can rearrange these equations as:\n1.  $y_i x_{i-1} - x_i y_{i-1} = -1$\n2.  $y_i x_{i+1} - x_i y_{i+1} = 1$\n\nAdding these two equations gives:\n$$(y_i x_{i+1} - x_i y_{i+1}) + (y_i x_{i-1} - x_i y_{i-1}) = 1 + (-1) = 0$$\n$$y_i(x_{i+1} + x_{i-1}) - x_i(y_{i+1} + y_{i-1}) = 0$$\n$$y_i(x_{i+1} + x_{i-1}) = x_i(y_{i+1} + y_{i-1})$$\n\nSince $x_i/y_i$ is an irreducible fraction, $\\gcd(x_i, y_i) = 1$. From the property of coprime integers, we must have:\n$$x_{i+1} + x_{i-1} = k x_i$$\n$$y_{i+1} + y_{i-1} = k y_i$$\nfor some integer $k$. This gives a recurrence relation for the terms of the Farey sequence:\n$$x_{i+1} = k x_i - x_{i-1}$$\n$$y_{i+1} = k y_i - y_{i-1}$$\nThis confirms that the successor term is a linear combination of the previous two terms. Now, we must determine the integer multiplier $k$.\n\nThe value of $k$ is constrained by the defining properties of $F_N$. First, all terms must satisfy $y_{j} > 0$. Since the sequence is strictly increasing and starts with non-negative terms, $k$ must be a positive integer.\nThe new term $x_{i+1}/y_{i+1}$ must be in $F_N$, which implies its denominator $y_{i+1} \\le N$.\n$$k y_i - y_{i-1} \\le N \\implies k y_i \\le N + y_{i-1} \\implies k \\le \\frac{N+y_{i-1}}{y_i}$$\nFurthermore, the pair $(x_i/y_i, x_{i+1}/y_{i+1})$ must be consecutive in $F_N$. This implies their mediant is excluded, i.e., its denominator must be greater than $N$:\n$$y_i + y_{i+1} > N$$\n$$y_i + (k y_i - y_{i-1}) > N \\implies (k+1)y_i - y_{i-1} > N \\implies k y_i > N + y_{i-1} - y_i$$\n$$k > \\frac{N + y_{i-1} - y_i}{y_i}$$\n\nCombining these two inequalities on $k$:\n$$\\frac{N + y_{i-1} - y_i}{y_i} < k \\le \\frac{N + y_{i-1}}{y_i}$$\nThe length of this interval for $k$ is exactly $(\\frac{N + y_{i-1}}{y_i}) - (\\frac{N + y_{i-1} - y_i}{y_i}) = \\frac{y_i}{y_i} = 1$.\nAn interval of the form $(A, B]$ with length $1$ contains exactly one integer. This integer is given by $\\lfloor B \\rfloor$. Therefore, $k$ is uniquely determined as:\n$$k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N+y_{i-1}}{y_i} \\right\\rfloor$$\nThis completes the derivation.

Initialize the sequence with the first two terms of $F_N$: $x_0/y_0 = 0/1$ and $x_1/y_1 = 1/N$.\n2.  Repeatedly generate the next term $x_{i+1}/y_{i+1}$ using the derived recurrence until the term $1/1$ is reached.\n\nWe must prove that this procedure correctly enumerates $F_N$.\n\n**Initialization**: For $N \\ge 1$, the first two terms of $F_N$ are indeed $0/1$ and $1/N$. Let's check if they satisfy the premises for our derivation.\n-   Unimodularity: $x_1 y_0 - y_1 x_0 = 1 \\cdot 1 - N \\cdot 0 = 1$. This holds.\n-   Mediant exclusion: The consecutive pair is $(0/1, 1/N)$. We must check if these are truly consecutive. Any fraction between them must have a denominator larger than $N$. The simplest fraction between them is their mediant $(0+1)/(1+N) = 1/(N+1)$, whose denominator is indeed greater than $N$. Thus, no term of $F_N$ lies between them. The initial pair is valid. Note: The condition $y_{i-1}+y_i > N$ is a consequence of consecutiveness, not a premise for it. For the initial pair, $y_0+y_1 = 1+N > N$. The starting conditions are consistent.\n\n**Inductive Step**: Assume we have correctly generated a prefix of $F_N$, say $x_0/y_0, \\dots, x_i/y_i$. We show that the generated $x_{i+1}/y_{i+1}$ is the correct next term.\n-   **Irreducibility**: The unimodularity check $x_{i+1}y_i - y_{i+1}x_i = (k x_i - x_{i-1})y_i - (k y_i - y_{i-1})x_i = y_{i-1}x_i - x_{i-1}y_i$. By the initial assumption for the pair $(x_{i-1}/y_{i-1}, x_i/y_i)$, we have $x_i y_{i-1} - y_i x_{i-1} = 1$. This expression is the same as $y_{i-1}x_i - x_{i-1}y_i$. Therefore, $x_{i+1}y_i - y_{i+1}x_i = 1$. This identity, a form of Bézout's identity for $x_{i+1}$ and $y_{i+1}$, implies $\\gcd(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) = 1$. The fraction is irreducible.\n-   **Denominator Bound**: By our choice of $k = \\lfloor (N+y_{i-1})/y_i \\rfloor$, we have $k \\le (N+y_{i-1})/y_i$. Thus $k y_i \\le N+y_{i-1}$, which rearranges to $y_{i+1} = k y_i - y_{i-1} \\le N$. The denominator is within the allowed range for $F_N$.\n-   **Strictly Increasing**: We need to show $x_{i+1}/y_{i+1} > x_i/y_i$. This is equivalent to $x_{i+1}y_i - y_{i+1}x_i > 0$. As shown above, this value is exactly $1$, so the condition holds. The sequence generated is strictly increasing.\n-   **Completeness (No Skipped Terms)**: The derivation for $k$ shows that for a given consecutive pair $(x_{i-1}/y_{i-1}, x_i/y_i)$, there is only one possible integer $k$ that produces a successor $x_{i+1}/y_{i+1}$ that can form a new consecutive pair $(x_i/y_i, x_{i+1}/y_{i+1})$ in $F_N$. Any other fraction $p/q \\in F_N$ with $p/q > x_i/y_i$ must have a structure different from the successor form, or have a larger denominator, or both, preventing it from appearing between $x_i/y_i$ and $x_{i+1}/y_{i+1}$. Therefore, no terms are skipped.\n\n**Termination**: The sequence of denominators $y_i$ is not guaranteed to be monotonic. However, the sequence of fractions is strictly increasing and bounded above by $1/1$. The set of all possible fractions in $F_N$ is finite. Since our algorithm generates distinct terms of $F_N$ at each step, it must terminate. The algorithm stops when the term $1/1$ is generated. After generating $1/1$, say $x_i/y_i = 1/1$, the next step would be based on the previous term $x_{i-1}/y_{i-1}$. Let's take $N=5$, the last pair is $(4/5, 1/1)$. $k = \\lfloor (5+5)/1 \\rfloor = 10$. $x_{i+1} = 10 \\cdot 1 - 4 = 6$, $y_{i+1} = 10 \\cdot 1 - 5 = 5$. The next term $6/5$ violates $x \\le y$. Thus, the enumeration naturally concludes at $1/1$.\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n\nThe algorithm generates the terms of $F_N$ one by one. The total number of terms is $|F_N| = 1 + \\sum_{m=1}^{N} \\varphi(m)$.\nEach step of the algorithm involves:\n1.  Calculating $k = \\lfloor (N+y_{i-1})/y_i \\rfloor$. This involves one addition, one division, and one floor operation.\n2.  Calculating $x_{i+1} = k x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $y_{i+1} = k y_i - y_{i-1}$. This involves two multiplications and two subtractions.\n\nAll operands ($N$, $x_j$, $y_j$) are integers bounded by $N$. Assuming standard integer arithmetic, these operations take constant time, $O(1)$.\nThe total number of steps to generate the full sequence is $|F_N| - 1$.\nTherefore, the total time complexity of the algorithm is $O(|F_N|)$. This is linear in the size of the output, which is asymptotically optimal.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\n# No other libraries outside the Python standard library are permitted.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function that orchestrates the test cases and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [1, 2, 5, 10, 100]\n    results = []\n    \n    for N in test_cases:\n        results.append(process_n_case(N))\n\n    # Format the final output line as specified.\n    # e.g., [[2,True,True,True],[3,True,True,True]]\n    # str(list) introduces spaces, e.g., '[2, True, True, True]'.\n    # A cleaner join without spaces inside each sublist:\n    formatted_results = [f\"[{r[0]},{r[1]},{r[2]},{r[3]}]\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\n\ndef phi(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    phi(n) counts the number of positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input to phi must be a positive integer.\")\n    \n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\n\ndef process_n_case(N: int) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the Farey sequence for a given order N and verifies its properties.\n\n    Args:\n        N: The order of the Farey sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list [L, S, U, T] where:\n        L is the length of the generated sequence.\n        S is a boolean for strict increase.\n        U is a boolean for unimodularity of consecutive pairs.\n        T is a boolean for matching the theoretical length.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N == 0:\n        # F_0 is just 0/1, but problem statement says N is positive.\n        return [0, True, True, False]\n\n    # Step 1: Enumerate F_N using the derived successor construction.\n    # Initialize with the first two terms: 0/1 and 1/N.\n    # A term a/b is represented as a tuple (a, b).\n    x0, y0 = 0, 1\n    x1, y1 = 1, N\n    \n    farey_sequence = [(x0, y0), (x1, y1)]\n    \n    # Handle N=1 case where the sequence is just (0,1), (1,1).\n    if N == 1:\n      # The loop condition (x1,y1) != (1, 1) will be false initially.\n      # The list is correctly [(0,1), (1,1)].\n      pass\n\n    while (x1, y1) != (1, 1):\n        # Apply the derived recurrence relation.\n        k = (N + y0) // y1\n        x2 = k * x1 - x0\n        y2 = k * y1 - y0\n        \n        farey_sequence.append((x2, y2))\n        \n        # Update terms for the next iteration.\n        x0, y0 = x1, y1\n        x1, y1 = x2, y2\n\n    # Step 2: Verify the four properties of the generated sequence.\n    # Property 1: Length L\n    L = len(farey_sequence)\n\n    # Property 2: Strict Increase (S)\n    is_strictly_increasing = True\n    for i in range(L - 1):\n        a, b = farey_sequence[i]\n        c, d = farey_sequence[i+1]\n        # Check a/b < c/d by cross-multiplication: ad < bc\n        if not (a * d < b * c):\n            is_strictly_increasing = False\n            break\n    S = is_strictly_increasing\n\n    # Property 3: Unimodularity (U)\n    is_unimodular = True\n    for i in range(L - 1):\n        a, b = farey_sequence[i]\n        c, d = farey_sequence[i+1]\n        # Check unimodularity: bc - ad = 1\n        if not (b * c - a * d == 1):\n            is_unimodular = False\n            break\n    U = is_unimodular\n\n    # Property 4: Theoretical Length Match (T)\n    # Theoretical length is 1 + sum_{m=1 to N} phi(m)\n    theoretical_length = 1 + sum(phi(m) for m in range(1, N + 1))\n    T = (L == theoretical_length)\n\n    return [L, S, U, T]\n\n# Execute the solver.\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "3014209"}]}
