However, it contains a minor notational ambiguity which must be addressed.\nThe definition of the quadratic term $(\\mathrm{Rm}(\\operatorname{Ric}))_{ij} := R_{ikjl}R_{kl}$ is ambiguous. A summation over repeated indices $k$ and $l$ would result in a $(0,2)$ tensor component. However, the term $R_{kl}$ typically represents the components of the Ricci tensor, which is a $(0,2)$ tensor (a matrix). Contracting it with the $(0,4)$ Riemann tensor $R_{ikjl}$ without raising indices is unconventional. The standard term appearing in the evolution equation for the Ricci tensor is $R_{ikjl}R^{kl}$, where $R^{kl} = g^{ka}g^{lb}R_{ab}$. We will assume this standard form is intended, as it is the only one that is meaningful in this context.\n\nThe evolution equation for the metric is the normalized Ricci flow:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g_{ij} \\;=\\; -2\\,R_{ij} \\;+\\; \\frac{2}{n}\\,\\bar R\\, g_{ij}\n$$\nThis equation is linear in its components. Let $h_{ij} = \\partial_t g_{ij}$. We can decompose $h_{ij}$ into two parts: $h_{ij} = h_{ij}^{(1)} + h_{ij}^{(2)}$, where $h_{ij}^{(1)} = -2R_{ij}$ corresponds to the unnormalized Ricci flow, and $h_{ij}^{(2)} = \\frac{2}{n}\\bar R g_{ij}$ corresponds to a time-dependent homothetic transformation.

Since $\\bar R$ is the spatial average of the scalar curvature, $C(t)$ is a function of time only and is spatially constant. The metric variation is $h_{ij}^{(2)} = C(t)g_{ij}$. We can now compute the variation of the Christoffel symbols:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}g^{km}\\big(\\nabla_{i}(Cg_{jm})+\\nabla_{j}(Cg_{im})-\\nabla_{m}(Cg_{ij})\\big)\n$$\nSince $C$ is spatially constant and $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection (so $\\nabla g=0$), all terms on the right-hand side are zero. Thus, $\\partial_{t}\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = 0$.\n\nThe evolution of the Riemann tensor of type $(1,3)$ is given by the formula $\\partial_t R^m{}_{ijk} = \\nabla_i (\\partial_t \\Gamma^m_{jk}) - \\nabla_j (\\partial_t \\Gamma^m_{ik})$. Since $\\partial_t \\Gamma = 0$ for this part of the flow, it follows that $\\partial_t R^m{}_{ijk}=0$.\n\nNow, we can find the evolution of the $(0,4)$ Riemann tensor, $\\mathrm{Rm}$, with components $R_{ijkl}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_2(R_{ijkl}) = \\partial_t (g_{im} R^m{}_{jkl}) = (\\partial_t g_{im}) R^m{}_{jkl} + g_{im} (\\partial_t R^m{}_{jkl})\n$$\nUsing $\\partial_t g_{im} = h_{im}^{(2)} = C g_{im}$ and $\\partial_t R^m{}_{jkl}=0$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_2(R_{ijkl}) = (C g_{im}) R^m{}_{jkl} + 0 = C R_{ijkl} = \\frac{2}{n}\\bar R R_{ijkl}\n$$\nIn operator notation, this is $\\mathcal{D}_2(\\mathrm{Rm}) = \\frac{2}{n}\\bar R\\, \\mathrm{Rm}$.\n\nNext, we find the evolution of the Ricci tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}$, with components $R_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_2(R_{ij}) = \\partial_t (g^{kl} R_{ikjl}) = (\\partial_t g^{kl}) R_{ikjl} + g^{kl}(\\partial_t R_{ikjl})\n$$\nThe variation of the inverse metric is $\\partial_t g^{kl} = -h^{(2)kl} = -C g^{kl}$.

The ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\lambda_{b}}{dt} = -2(n-1) $$\nThe initial condition is $g_{b}(0) = g_{0}$. From the homothety assumption, $g_{b}(0) = \\lambda_{b}(0)g_{0}$.

By definition, its length is $L_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t) = \\ell(t)$. We have $|\\gamma_t'(s)|_{g(t)}^2 = g(t)(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) = 1$ for all $s \\in [0, \\ell(t)]$.\n\nTo find $\\frac{d}{dt}\\ell(t)$, we use the first variation formula for distance. The distance $\\ell(t)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all paths from $p$ to $q$. This infimum is achieved by the geodesic $\\gamma_t$. A standard result from the calculus of variations (often called the Hadamard or first variation formula) states that the derivative of the length can be computed by evaluating the variation of the length functional on the minimizing path, without needing to account for the variation of the path itself.\n\nLet $\\gamma_t$ be a minimizing geodesic for $g(t)$. We can express the derivative of the distance function as follows:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\ell(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} L_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t) $$\nThe general first variation formula for the length of a curve $\\gamma$ under a variation of the metric $g(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} L_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} (\\partial_t g(t))(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) ds $$\nThis formula holds because the contribution from the variation of the path $\\gamma_t$ vanishes, as $\\gamma_t$ is a critical point (a geodesic) of the length functional for fixed endpoints.\n\nNow, we substitute the Ricci flow equation, $\\partial_t g(t) = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}$, into this formula:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} d_{g(t)}(p,q) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} (-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)})(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) ds $$\nThis simplifies to the desired expression:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} d_{g(t)}(p,q) = -\\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) ds $$\n\n**Part 2: Bounds for the derivative**\n\nLet $R(s,t) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s))$ be the Ricci curvature along the geodesic $\\gamma_t$ in the direction of its tangent vector. Let's define the infimum and supremum of this quantity along the geodesic at a fixed time $t$:\n$$ R_{\\inf}(t) = \\inf_{s \\in [0, \\ell(t)]} \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) $$\n$$ R_{\\sup}(t) = \\sup_{s \\in [0, \\ell(t)]} \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) $$\nBy definition, for any $s \\in [0, \\ell(t)]$, we have $R_{\\inf}(t) \\le R(s,t) \\le R_{\\sup}(t)$.\nWe can integrate these inequalities over the length of the geodesic, from $s=0$ to $s=\\ell(t)$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} R_{\\inf}(t) ds \\le \\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} R(s,t) ds \\le \\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} R_{\\sup}(t) ds $$\nSince $R_{\\inf}(t)$ and $R_{\\sup}(t)$ are constant with respect to the integration variable $s$:\n$$ \\ell(t) R_{\\inf}(t) \\le \\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} R(s,t) ds \\le \\ell(t) R_{\\sup}(t) $$\nMultiplying the entire inequality by $-1$ reverses the inequalities:\n$$ -\\ell(t) R_{\\sup}(t) \\le -\\int_{0}^{\\ell(t)} R(s,t) ds \\le -\\ell(t) R_{\\inf}(t) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{d}{dt}d_{g(t)}(p,q)$ and $\\ell(t)=d_{g(t)}(p,q)$, we obtain the bounds:\n$$ -d_{g(t)}(p,q) \\sup_{s} \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) \\le \\frac{d}{dt}d_{g(t)}(p,q) \\le -d_{g(t)}(p,q) \\inf_{s} \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) $$\n\n**Part 3: Specialization to the n-sphere**\n\nWe now consider the specific case where $M=S^n$ and the initial metric $g(0)$ is the round metric of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For such a metric, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(0)} = (n-1)K g(0)$, which in our case is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(0)} = (n-1)g(0) $$\nThis shows that the initial metric is an Einstein metric. A key property of the Ricci flow is that if the initial metric is Einstein, the metric evolves by a simple scaling. Let us assume a solution of the form $g(t) = f(t)g(0)$ for some scalar function $f(t)$, with the initial condition $f(0)=1$.\n\nThe time derivative of the metric is $\\partial_t g(t) = f'(t)g(0)$.\nFor a scaled metric $g=f g_0$, the Ricci tensor is invariant: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_0}$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(0)} = (n-1)g(0)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Ricci flow equation $\\partial_t g(t) = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}$:\n$$ f'(t)g(0) = -2(n-1)g(0) $$\nThis gives a simple ordinary differential equation for $f(t)$: $f'(t) = -2(n-1)$.\nIntegrating with respect to $t$ and using the initial condition $f(0)=1$, we find:\n$$ f(t) = 1 - 2(n-1)t $$\nSo the metric evolves as $g(t) = \\left(1 - 2(n-1)t\\right)g(0)$. The flow exists for $t < \\frac{1}{2(n-1)}$, at which time the sphere shrinks to a point.\n\nThe distance $d_{g(t)}(p,q)$ is related to the initial distance $d_{g(0)}(p,q)$ by the square root of the scaling factor:\n$$ d_{g(t)}(p,q) = \\sqrt{f(t)} d_{g(0)}(p,q) = \\sqrt{1 - 2(n-1)t} \\cdot d_{g(0)}(p,q) $$\nWe can find the derivative $\\frac{d}{dt}d_{g(t)}(p,q)$ by directly differentiating this expression:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}d_{g(t)}(p,q) = d_{g(0)}(p,q) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}\\sqrt{1 - 2(n-1)t} = d_{g(0)}(p,q) \\cdot \\frac{-2(n-1)}{2\\sqrt{1 - 2(n-1)t}} = \\frac{-(n-1)d_{g(0)}(p,q)}{\\sqrt{1 - 2(n-1)t}} $$\nTo get the final answer in terms of $n$, $t$, and $d_{g(t)}(p,q)$, we express $d_{g(0)}(p,q)$ in terms of $d_{g(t)}(p,q)$:\n$$ d_{g(0)}(p,q) = \\frac{d_{g(t)}(p,q)}{\\sqrt{1 - 2(n-1)t}} $$\nSubstituting this into the derivative expression:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}d_{g(t)}(p,q) = \\frac{-(n-1)}{\\sqrt{1 - 2(n-1)t}} \\cdot \\frac{d_{g(t)}(p,q)}{\\sqrt{1 - 2(n-1)t}} = \\frac{-(n-1)d_{g(t)}(p,q)}{1 - 2(n-1)t} $$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula from Part 1. The integrand is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s))$.\nWe have $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)} = (n-1)g(0)$.\nSince $\\gamma_t$ is arc-length parameterized with respect to $g(t)$, we have $g(t)(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s))=1$.\n$1 = g(t)(\\gamma_t', \\gamma_t') = (1 - 2(n-1)t)g(0)(\\gamma_t', \\gamma_t')$.\nThis gives $g(0)(\\gamma_t', \\gamma_t') = \\frac{1}{1 - 2(n-1)t}$.\nThe integrand is therefore:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\gamma_t'(s), \\gamma_t'(s)) = (n-1)g(0)(\\gamma_t', \\gamma_t') = \\frac{n-1}{1 - 2(n-1)t} $$\nThis value is constant along the geodesic. Substituting into the integral formula:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}d_{g(t)}(p,q) = -\\int_{0}^{d_{g(t)}(p,q)} \\frac{n-1}{1 - 2(n-1)t} ds = -\\frac{n-1}{1 - 2(n-1)t} \\int_{0}^{d_{g(t)}(p,q)} ds $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}d_{g(t)}(p,q) = -\\frac{n-1}{1 - 2(n-1)t} d_{g(t)}(p,q) $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{(n-1)d_{g(t)}(p,q)}{1-2(n-1)t}}$$", "id": "2974554"}]}
