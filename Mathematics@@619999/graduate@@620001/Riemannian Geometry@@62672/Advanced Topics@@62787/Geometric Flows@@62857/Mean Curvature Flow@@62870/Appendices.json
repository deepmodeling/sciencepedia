The flow equation is $\\partial_{t}\\gamma=\\kappa\\,\\mathbf{n}$, which states that the normal component of the velocity of any point on the curve is equal to the curvature at that point.\n\nLet the curve at a fixed time $t$ be parameterized by $x$ as $\\gamma(x) = (x, v(x))$, where $v(x) = u(x)+ct$.\n\n1.  **Velocity Vector**: The velocity of a point on the curve corresponding to a fixed $x$ is given by the partial derivative with respect to $t$:\n    $$\n    \\partial_t \\gamma(x, t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (x, u(x) + ct) = (0, c)\n    $$\n\n2.  **Geometric Quantities**: We compute the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ and the curvature $\\kappa$ for the graph $y=v(x)$.\n    - The tangent vector is $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx} = (1, v'(x))$.\n    - We choose the upward-pointing unit normal vector:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{(-v'(x), 1)}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}}\n      $$\n    - The signed curvature $\\kappa$ for a graph $y=v(x)$, corresponding to this choice of normal, is given by the formula:\n      $$\n      \\kappa = \\frac{v''(x)}{(1 + (v'(x))^2)^{3/2}}\n      $$\n\n3.  **Normal Velocity**: The normal velocity is the projection of the velocity vector $\\partial_t \\gamma$ onto the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$:\n    $$\n    \\text{Normal Velocity} = (\\partial_t \\gamma) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (0, c) \\cdot \\frac{(-v'(x), 1)}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Derive the Condition on $c$**: We equate the normal velocity to the curvature $\\kappa$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1 + (v'(x))^2}} = \\frac{v''(x)}{(1 + (v'(x))^2)^{3/2}}\n    $$\n    Multiplying both sides by $(1 + (v'(x))^2)^{1/2}$ yields the condition that $c$ must satisfy:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{v''(x)}{1 + (v'(x))^2}\n    $$\n    Since $v(x) = u(x)+ct$, its derivatives with respect to $x$ are the same as for $u(x)$: $v'(x)=u'(x)$ and $v''(x)=u''(x)$. So, the condition is:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{u''(x)}{1 + (u'(x))^2}\n    $$\n    For this to be a valid translating solution with a constant $c$, the expression on the right-hand side must be constant for all $x$ in the domain.\n\n5.  **Calculate $c$ for the given function**: We are given $u(x) = -\\ln(\\cos x)$ for $x \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. We compute its first and second derivatives:\n    - First derivative:\n      $$\n      u'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (-\\ln(\\cos x)) = - \\frac{1}{\\cos x} (-\\sin x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\tan x\n      $$\n    - Second derivative:\n      $$\n      u''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (\\tan x) = \\sec^2 x\n      $$\n    Now, we substitute these derivatives into the condition for $c$:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{\\sec^2 x}{1 + (\\tan x)^2}\n    $$\n    Using the trigonometric identity $1 + \\tan^2 x = \\sec^2 x$, we find:\n    $$\n    c = \\frac{\\sec^2 x}{\\sec^2 x} = 1\n    $$\n    The value of the expression is indeed constant and equal to $1$.

Let $X: M^n \\times [0, T) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the family of immersions.\n\n1.  **Translating Soliton Condition**: The solution is a translating solution, which means the hypersurface translates with a constant velocity vector $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The position vector at time $t$ is given by:\n    $$\n    X(p, t) = X_0(p) + tV\n    $$\n    The velocity of any point on the hypersurface is $\\partial_t X = V$. The MCF equation is $\\partial_t X = -H\\mathbf{n}$, where $H$ is the mean curvature and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal. For a translating solution, we must therefore have:\n    $$\n    V = -H\\mathbf{n}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Laplace-Beltrami Operator Identity**: A fundamental identity for a hypersurface in Euclidean space relates its position vector $X$ to its mean curvature vector $H\\mathbf{n}$ via the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_M$ on the hypersurface. Depending on the sign convention for the Laplacian, this identity is $\\Delta_M X = -H\\mathbf{n}$ or $\\Delta_M X = H\\mathbf{n}$. Let's use the convention $\\Delta_M X = -H\\mathbf{n}$.\n\n3.  **Combining Identities**: By combining the translating soliton condition with the Laplace-Beltrami identity, we obtain an equation on the hypersurface $M_t$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_M X = V\n    $$\n\n4.  **Application of Maximum Principle**: Let's consider the scalar function $f: M^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by the dot product of the position vector $X$ with the constant translation vector $V$:\n    $$\n    f(p) = V \\cdot X(p, t)\n    $$\n    We apply the Laplace-Beltrami operator to $f$. Since $V$ is a constant vector and $\\Delta_M$ is a linear operator which acts component-wise on vector-valued functions, we have:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_M f = \\Delta_M(V \\cdot X) = V \\cdot (\\Delta_M X)\n    $$\n    Substituting $\\Delta_M X = V$ into this equation, we get:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_M f = V \\cdot V = |V|^2\n    $$\n    The hypersurface $M_t$ is assumed to be closed, which means it is a compact manifold without boundary. We can integrate the equation $\\Delta_M f = |V|^2$ over the manifold $M_t$:\n    $$\n    \\int_{M_t} \\Delta_M f \\, d\\mu = \\int_{M_t} |V|^2 \\, d\\mu\n    $$\n    By the divergence theorem (or Green's identity) on a compact manifold without boundary, the integral of the Laplacian of any smooth function is zero. Thus:\n    $$\n    0 = \\int_{M_t} |V|^2 \\, d\\mu = |V|^2 \\cdot \\text{Area}(M_t)\n    $$\n    Since the area of the hypersurface is positive, this implies $|V|^2 = 0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The condition $|V|^2 = 0$ implies that the vector $V$ is the zero vector, $V = \\mathbf{0}$. This means that any closed translating solution to the mean curvature flow must be a trivial solution, corresponding to a stationary hypersurface ($M_t=M_0$ for all $t$). Therefore, no nontrivial ($V \\neq \\mathbf{0}$) compact translating solutions exist for closed hypersurfaces under mean curvature flow.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the constant $c$ found in Part 1.\nBased on the derivation in Part 1, the value is $c=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3036003"}]}
