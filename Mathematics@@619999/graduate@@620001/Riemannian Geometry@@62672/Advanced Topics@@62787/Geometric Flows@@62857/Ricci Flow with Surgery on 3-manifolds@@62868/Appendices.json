It is a well-posed and standard problem in Riemannian geometry.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to solve it.\n\n### Solution\nThe evolution of the metric $g(t)$ is governed by the Ricci flow equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nThe metric in the neck region is given by the ansatz:\n$$\ng(t) = dz^{2} + r(t)^{2}\\, g_{S^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $g_{S^2}$ is a time-independent metric on the 2-sphere. The only time dependence in the metric arises from the scalar function $r(t)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the left-hand side of the Ricci flow equation, which is the time derivative of the metric tensor $g(t)$.\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( dz^{2} + r(t)^{2}\\, g_{S^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $dz^2$ and $g_{S^2}$ are independent of time, the derivative acts only on the coefficient $r(t)^2$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(r(t)^{2}) \\,g_{S^{2}} = 2 r(t) \\frac{dr}{dt} \\,g_{S^{2}}\n$$\nThis is a tensor that is zero on vector fields in the $z$-direction and equals $2 r(t) \\dot{r}(t) g_{S^2}$ on vector fields tangent to the $S^2$ factor. Here, $\\dot{r}(t) = \\frac{dr}{dt}$.\n\nNext, we determine the right-hand side of the Ricci flow equation, which involves the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ of the metric $g(t)$. The problem states to use the Ricci tensor for the product metric $dz^2 + r(t)^2 g_{S^2}$. For a product of Riemannian manifolds $(M_1,g_1)$ and $(M_2,g_2)$, the Ricci tensor of the product metric $g_1 \\oplus g_2$ is the direct sum of the individual Ricci tensors, $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_1) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ric}(g_2)$.\n\nIn our case, $(M_1, g_1)$ is the interval $I$ with the flat metric $dz^2$. Any 1-dimensional manifold is Ricci-flat, so $\\mathrm{Ric}(dz^2) = 0$. This corresponds to the $z$-direction component of the Ricci tensor.\n\nThe second part, $(M_2, g_2)$, is the 2-sphere of radius $r(t)$, with metric $g_{S^2_{r(t)}} = r(t)^2 g_{S^2}$. The problem provides the formula for its Ricci tensor: \"the Ricci tensor of $(S^{2}, r^{2} g_{S^{2}})$ equals $\\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ times the metric restricted to the $S^{2}$ directions\". The metric restricted to the $S^2$ directions is $r(t)^2 g_{S^2}$. Thus, the Ricci tensor on the sphere is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(r(t)^2 g_{S^2}) = \\frac{1}{r(t)^2} \\left( r(t)^2 g_{S^2} \\right) = g_{S^2}\n$$\nCombining the components, the Ricci tensor of the full product metric $g(t)$ has a block structure: it is zero in the $z$-direction and equals $g_{S^2}$ in the directions tangent to the sphere.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\partial_t g(t)$ and $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ back into the Ricci flow equation.\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nConsidering the components of the equation in the $z$-direction, we have $0 = -2(0)$, which is consistent but provides no information.\nConsidering the components in the directions tangent to the $S^2$ factors, we have:\n$$\n2 r(t) \\dot{r}(t) g_{S^2} = -2 g_{S^2}\n$$\nSince $g_{S^2}$ is a non-degenerate metric tensor, we can equate the scalar coefficients on both sides of the equation. This yields the ordinary differential equation for the radius $r(t)$:\n$$\n2 r(t) \\dot{r}(t) = -2\n$$\n$$\nr(t) \\frac{dr}{dt} = -1\n$$\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{dt}(r(t)^2) = -1$.\nWe solve this ODE by separation of variables or direct integration:\n$$\n\\int r \\,dr = \\int -1 \\,dt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} r(t)^2 = -t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Thus,\n$$\nr(t)^2 = 2C - 2t\n$$\nThe problem states that $t=T$ is a singular time. In this neck-pinch model, the singularity occurs when the radius of the cylinder shrinks to zero, i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to T} r(t) = 0$. Applying this condition:\n$$\nr(T)^2 = 0 = 2C - 2T\n$$\nThis allows us to determine the integration constant: $2C = 2T$.\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $r(t)^2$:\n$$\nr(t)^2 = 2T - 2t = 2(T-t)\n$$\nSince the radius $r(t)$ must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nr(t) = \\sqrt{2(T-t)} = \\sqrt{2} \\,(T-t)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the asymptotic behavior of $r(t)$ near the singular time $T$ as:\n$$\nr(t) \\sim A \\,(T - t)^{p}\n$$\nBy comparing our derived solution with this asymptotic form, we can identify the constant $A = \\sqrt{2}$ and the exponent $p$.\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} \\,(T-t)^{1/2} = A \\,(T-t)^p\n$$\nThe exponent is therefore $p = 1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2988720"}, {"introduction": "While an ideal neck is easy to visualize, identifying such structures within a complex, evolving 3-manifold requires a rigorous, quantitative procedure.

Each result must be a boolean indicating whether the corresponding test case satisfies the quantitative neck criterion.", "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The problem resides squarely within the domain of Riemannian geometry, specifically concerning the analysis of Ricci flow on $3$-manifolds. It asks for the implementation of a quantitative neck detection algorithm, a concept of central importance in the theory of Ricci flow with surgery, as developed by Hamilton and canonized in Perelman's proof of the Poincar√© and Geometrization conjectures. The provided data and criteria are sufficient and consistent for a unique solution to be determined, though a minor ambiguity regarding the presentation of test case data will be addressed by adhering strictly to the formal mathematical definitions.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine if a region of a $3$-manifold, sampled at a finite number of points, geometrically resembles a cylinder of the form $S^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The Ricci flow equation, $\\partial_t g(t) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$, evolves the metric $g(t)$ in a way that tends to even out curvature. Regions of high positive curvature shrink, and in three dimensions, can form \"neck\" singularities where the manifold locally looks like a shrinking cylinder. To continue the flow past these singularities, one performs surgery, which involves identifying and excising these neck regions. The implemented criterion is a formalization of this identification process.\n\nA key principle is scale-invariance. The geometry of a neck is independent of its absolute size (the radius of the $S^2$ factor). The Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ and scalar curvature $R$ both scale inversely with the metric scaling factor, so their ratio is scale-invariant. The criterion is therefore formulated in terms of the normalized eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor, $\\mu_k = \\lambda_k/R$, where $\\lambda_k$ are the eigenvalues of $\\operatorname{Ric}$ and $R=\\sum \\lambda_k$. For an ideal cylinder $S^2(r) \\times \\mathbb{R}$, the Ricci eigenvalues are $(1/r^2, 1/r^2, 0)$, and the scalar curvature is $R=2/r^2$. The normalized spectrum is thus exactly $(0, 1/2, 1/2)$, independent of the radius $r$. The provided algorithm checks if the sampled region is \"close\" to this ideal cylindrical spectrum in a quantified sense.\n\nThe procedural implementation will follow the three sets of conditions provided.\n\nFirst, it is essential to process the input data correctly. The problem provides, for each sample point $i$, a set of three normalized eigenvalues. The definitions in the criterion rely on the ordered eigenvalues $\\lambda_{i,1}\\le \\lambda_{i,2}\\le \\lambda_{i,3}$ and the corresponding ordered normalized eigenvalues $\\mu_{i,1}\\le \\mu_{i,2}\\le \\mu_{i,3}$ (assuming positive scalar curvature $R_i>0$, which is true for all test data). The provided data for the normalized eigenvalues is not always pre-sorted. Therefore, for each sample point $i$, the first step must be to sort the given triplet of values to obtain the ordered set $(\\mu_{i,1}, \\mu_{i,2}, \\mu_{i,3})$.\n\nThe algorithmic validation then proceeds as follows, using the given thresholds $\\varepsilon = 0.05$, $\\delta = 0.06$, $\\nu = 0.03$, and $\\theta = 0.08$:\n\n1.  **Local Cylindrical Spectrum Validation:** This set of conditions must hold for every sample point $i$ from $1$ to $m=5$.\n    - Nonnegativity and small axial curvature: The smallest eigenvalue corresponds to the 'axial' direction of the cylinder, which is flat. This is tested by the condition $0\\le \\mu_{i,1}\\le \\varepsilon$.\n    - Near-spherical spectrum: The other two eigenvalues correspond to the $S^2$ factor, which has positive curvature. For an ideal cylinder, both are $\\frac{1}{2}$. This is tested by checking if both $\\mu_{i,2}$ and $\\mu_{i,3}$ are close to $\\frac{1}{2}$: $\\lvert \\mu_{i,2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rvert\\le \\varepsilon$ and $\\lvert \\mu_{i,3}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rvert\\le \\varepsilon$.\n    - Low anisotropy: The two spherical directions should have nearly identical curvature. This is checked with the condition $\\lvert \\mu_{i,3}-\\mu_{i,2}\\rvert\\le \\delta$.\n    If any of these inequalities is violated for any sample point $i$, the entire test case is classified as not being a quantitative neck.\n\n2.  **Axial Uniformity Validation:** A neck is not just a single point with a cylindrical spectrum, but a region extended along an axis. This criterion ensures the spectral properties are uniform along the candidate axis.\n    - For each eigenvalue index $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, the total variation of $\\mu_{i,k}$ across all samples $i=1, \\dots, m$ is computed as $\\max_i \\mu_{i,k}-\\min_i \\mu_{i,k}$.\n    - This variation must be bounded by the threshold $\\nu$. That is, for each $k$, we must have $\\max_i \\mu_{i,k}-\\min_i \\mu_{i,k}\\le \\nu$.\n\n3.  **Controlled Scalar Curvature Variation:** The scalar curvature $R$ is related to the inverse square of the neck's radius. This condition ensures the neck's thickness does not vary excessively along the axis.\n    - The relative variation of the scalar curvature is calculated as $\\dfrac{\\max_i R_i-\\min_i R_i}{\\bar{R}}$, where $\\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_i R_i$ is the average scalar curvature over the samples.\n    - This relative variation must be bounded by the threshold $\\theta$: $\\dfrac{\\max_i R_i-\\min_i R_i}{\\bar{R}}\\le \\theta$.\n\nA test case is declared a quantitative neck if and only if all three of these multipart conditions are fully satisfied. The program will systematically check each condition for each test case and return a boolean result.

This practice delves into the precise construction of the \"caps\" used to seal the manifold after a neck has been excised [@problem_id:1017510]. By enforcing conditions of metric matching and requiring the surgical seam to be a minimal surface, you will determine the necessary radius of the standard 3-sphere from which these caps are harvested, revealing the deep geometric principles that ensure the post-surgery manifold is well-behaved.", "problem": "In the Ricci flow on a 3-manifold, surgery is a crucial procedure to handle neck-pinch singularities. This problem concerns the geometric specifications of such a surgery.\n\nA surgery procedure is controlled by a small length-scale parameter $\\delta  0$. The process is initiated when the maximum scalar curvature on the manifold, $R_{max}$, reaches the threshold value $1/\\delta^2$. The surgery takes place on a *canonical neck*, a region geometrically modeled as a cylinder $S^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ with the Riemannian metric $ds^2 = dz^2 + r^2 g_{S^2}$, where $z$ is the coordinate along the cylinder axis, $r$ is the radius of the $S^2$ cross-sections, and $g_{S^2}$ is the standard metric on a unit 2-sphere. The scalar curvature of such a cylinder is given by $R_{cyl} = 2/r^2$.\n\nThe specific neck targeted for surgery is one where its scalar curvature is a fixed fraction $\\alpha$ of the threshold curvature, i.e., $R_{cyl} = \\alpha R_{max}$, for a given constant $0  \\alpha \\le 1$.\n\nThe surgery involves excising the neck and gluing in two *caps* to seal the resulting boundaries. Each cap is a geodesic ball taken from a standard 3-sphere, $S^3$, of radius $R$. The metric of an $S^3$ of radius $R$, in geodesic normal coordinates $(\\rho, \\Omega)$ from a pole, is given by\n$$ds^2_{S^3} = d\\rho^2 + R^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\rho}{R}) g_{S^2}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the geodesic distance from the pole. A cap is a region defined by $0 \\le \\rho \\le \\rho_0$ for some $\\rho_0$.\n\nTo ensure a geometrically sound attachment, two conditions must be met at the boundary where the cap is glued to the remaining part of the manifold:\n1.  The metric on the boundary of the cap must match the metric of the neck's cross-section.\n2.  The boundary of the cap must be a minimal surface when viewed as a submanifold of the cap's geometry. This ensures the smoothest possible join.\n\nDetermine the radius $R$ of the standard 3-sphere used for the surgery.
