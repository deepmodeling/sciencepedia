A full solution and evaluation of options will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to prove the weak maximum principle for a function $u \\in C^{2,1}(M \\times [0,T])$ on a closed manifold $(M, g(t))$ that satisfies $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u \\leq 0$. This principle states that the spatial supremum of $u$ does not increase with time. The argument is a classic \"perturbation and contradiction\" method, often known as the \"$\\varepsilon t$ trick\". Note that for this weak principle, the specific evolution equation for the metric is not used; the argument holds for any smooth family of metrics $g(t)$.\n\nLet's attempt a direct proof by contradiction. Suppose the spatial supremum is not nonincreasing. Then there exists some $t_1 > 0$ such that $\\sup_{x \\in M} u(x,t_1) > \\sup_{x \\in M} u(x,0)$. Since $M \\times [0,T]$ is compact and $u$ is continuous, $u$ must attain its global maximum at some point $(x_0, t_0) \\in M \\times [0,T]$. Our assumption implies that this maximum value is strictly greater than the maximum value at time $t=0$, so we must have $t_0 > 0$.\n\nAt an interior maximum point $(x_0, t_0)$ with $t_0 \\in (0,T]$, the following first and second derivative conditions must hold:\n1.  The function $t \\mapsto u(x_0, t)$ has a maximum at $t_0$, so $\\partial_{t} u(x_{0},t_{0}) \\geq 0$.\n2.  The function $x \\mapsto u(x, t_0)$ has a maximum at $x_0$, so its gradient is zero and its Hessian is negative semidefinite. This implies that the Laplacian at this point is nonpositive: $\\Delta_{g(t_{0})} u(x_{0},t_{0}) \\leq 0$.\n\nCombining these conditions, we find that at the maximum point $(x_0, t_0)$:\n$$(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t_{0})})\\,u(x_{0},t_{0}) = \\partial_{t}u(x_{0},t_{0}) - \\Delta_{g(t_{0})}u(x_{0},t_{0}) \\geq 0 - (\\text{a nonpositive value}) \\geq 0.$$\nHowever, the given inequality is $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u \\leq 0$. This forces $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t_{0})})\\,u(x_{0},t_{0}) = 0$. This is not a contradiction and thus insufficient to complete the proof.\n\nTo create a definitive contradiction, we introduce a perturbed auxiliary function. Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ be a small constant, and define:\n$$u_{\\varepsilon}(x,t) = u(x,t) - \\varepsilon t.$$\nWe apply the parabolic operator to $u_{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u_{\\varepsilon} = (\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})(u - \\varepsilon t) = (\\partial_{t}u - \\varepsilon) - \\Delta_{g(t)}u = ((\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u) - \\varepsilon.$$\nUsing the given inequality $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u \\leq 0$, we obtain a strict inequality for $u_{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u_{\\varepsilon} \\leq -\\varepsilon < 0.$$\nNow, let $(x_{0}, t_{0})$ be a point where $u_{\\varepsilon}$ attains its maximum on the compact set $M \\times [0,T]$. Assume for contradiction that $t_{0} > 0$. At this interior maximum point, the necessary conditions are $\\partial_{t}u_{\\varepsilon}(x_{0}, t_{0}) \\geq 0$ and $\\Delta_{g(t_{0})}u_{\\varepsilon}(x_{0}, t_{0}) \\leq 0$. These imply:\n$$(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t_{0})})\\,u_{\\varepsilon}(x_{0}, t_{0}) \\geq 0.$$\nThis result directly contradicts the strict inequality $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u_{\\varepsilon} < 0$, which must hold everywhere, including at $(x_0, t_0)$. The contradiction proves that our assumption $t_0 > 0$ was false. Therefore, the maximum of $u_{\\varepsilon}$ must occur on the initial time slice, $t=0$.\n\nThis implies that for any $(x,t) \\in M \\times [0,T]$:\n$$u_{\\varepsilon}(x,t) \\leq \\max_{y \\in M} u_{\\varepsilon}(y,0).$$\nSubstituting the definition of $u_{\\varepsilon}$ back into this inequality:\n$$u(x,t) - \\varepsilon t \\leq \\max_{y \\in M} (u(y,0) - 0) = \\sup_{y \\in M} u(y,0).$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$u(x,t) \\leq \\sup_{y \\in M} u(y,0) + \\varepsilon t.$$\nTaking the supremum over $x \\in M$ on the left side, we get:\n$$\\sup_{x \\in M} u(x,t) \\leq \\sup_{y \\in M} u(y,0) + \\varepsilon t.$$\nThis inequality holds for any chosen $\\varepsilon > 0$. By taking the limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$, we conclude:\n$$\\sup_{x \\in M} u(x,t) \\leq \\sup_{y \\in M} u(y,0).$$\nThis demonstrates that the spatial supremum of $u$ is a nonincreasing function of time.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Introduce $u_{\\varepsilon}(x,t)=u(x,t)-\\varepsilon t$ with $\\varepsilon>0$, so that $$(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u_{\\varepsilon}\\leq -\\varepsilon<0.$$ If $u_{\\varepsilon}$ attained a space–time maximum at $(x_{0},t_{0})$ with $t_{0}>0$, then $\\partial_{t}u_{\\varepsilon}(x_{0},t_{0})\\geq 0$ and $\\Delta_{g(t_{0})}u_{\\varepsilon}(x_{0},t_{0})\\leq 0$, hence $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t_{0})})u_{\\varepsilon}(x_{0},t_{0})\\geq 0$, contradicting $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})u_{\\varepsilon}\\leq -\\varepsilon$. Therefore the maximum of $u_{\\varepsilon}$ occurs at $t=0$, which implies $\\sup_{M}u(\\cdot,t)\\leq \\sup_{M}u(\\cdot,0)+\\varepsilon t$, and letting $\\varepsilon\\to 0^{+}$ yields the desired monotonicity.**\nThis option provides a complete and correct description of the standard proof of the weak maximum principle. Every step—the choice of perturbation, the derivation of the strict inequality, the contradiction argument at an interior maximum, and the final limiting process—is accurately stated.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Introduce $u_{\\varepsilon}(x,t)=u(x,t)+\\varepsilon t$ with $\\varepsilon>0$, so that $$(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u_{\\varepsilon}\\leq \\varepsilon.$$ By the strong maximum principle, this forces $u$ to be spatially constant for each $t$, so the supremum is nonincreasing.**\nThe proposed perturbation $u(x,t)+\\varepsilon t$ is incorrect for the given inequality $(\\partial_t-\\Delta_{g(t)})\\,u \\leq 0$. This choice leads to $(\\partial_t-\\Delta_{g(t)})u_{\\varepsilon} \\leq \\varepsilon$, which does not create a contradiction at an interior maximum. The subsequent appeal to the strong maximum principle and the conclusion that $u$ is spatially constant are also erroneous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use the Ricci flow identity $\\partial_{t}g(t)=-2\\operatorname{Rc}_{g(t)}$ to conclude that $\\Delta_{g(t)}$ is monotone decreasing as an operator. Then adding $+\\varepsilon t$ to $u$ compensates for the curvature effects, making $(\\partial_{t}-\\Delta_{g(t)})$ negative definite and prohibiting interior maxima at $t>0$.**\nThis option presents several falsehoods. The Laplacian operator $\\Delta_{g(t)}$ is not generally \"monotone decreasing\" under Ricci flow. Its evolution is complex and depends on the curvature. The claim that adding $+\\varepsilon t$ \"compensates for curvature effects\" is unsubstantiated and vague, and as established in B, this perturbation is of the wrong sign for this problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. On a closed manifold, any continuous time-dependent function attains its global maximum at the initial time $t=0$. Adding $+\\varepsilon t$ to $u$ merely accentuates this property, ensuring the supremum is nonincreasing.**\nThe foundational premise of this option is patently false. A general continuous function on $M \\times [0,T]$ can attain its maximum at any time $t \\in [0,T]$. The nonincreasing nature of $\\sup u$ is a consequence of the specific PDE that $u$ satisfies, not a general property of all functions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The parabolic comparison principle requires temporal mollification by a Gaussian kernel. Adding $+\\varepsilon t$ to $u$ is a first-order surrogate for this mollification, which regularizes the inequality and yields the monotonicity of the supremum.**\nThis option misinterprets the techniques. Mollification is a smoothing procedure, typically used for weak solutions or rough data, which is unnecessary here since $u$ is assumed to be a classical $C^{2,1}$ solution. The perturbation by $\\pm \\varepsilon t$ is an algebraic trick to achieve a strict inequality for a contradiction argument; it is not a form of regularization or mollification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2983609"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational principle, our next practice explores its power in proving major geometric theorems about Ricci flow.

On a closed manifold, the minimum of the scalar curvature $R(\\cdot,t)$ is a nondecreasing function of $t$ along the flow.**\n\nTo verify this, we require the evolution equation for the scalar curvature $R$.

Both are computed with respect to the metric $g(t)$.\n\nLet $R_{\\min}(t) = \\min_{x \\in M} R(x,t)$. Since $M$ is a closed (compact) manifold, this minimum is always attained. Let $t_0 \\in [0, T)$ be a time, and let $x_0 \\in M$ be a point where the spatial minimum is achieved at time $t_0$, i.e., $R(x_0, t_0) = R_{\\min}(t_0)$. At such a point, standard calculus implies that the gradient of the function vanishes, $\\nabla R(x_0, t_0) = 0$, and the Hessian is non-negative definite, which means the Laplacian is non-negative, $\\Delta R(x_0, t_0) \\ge 0$.\n\nEvaluating the evolution equation for $R$ at the point $(x_0, t_0)$, we get:\n$$ \\partial_t R(x_0, t_0) = \\Delta R(x_0, t_0) + 2|\\mathrm{Ric}(x_0, t_0)|^2 $$\nUsing the conditions at the minimum point, we have:\n$$ \\partial_t R(x_0, t_0) \\ge 0 + 2|\\mathrm{Ric}(x_0, t_0)|^2 $$\nSince $|\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 \\ge 0$, we conclude that $\\partial_t R(x_0, t_0) \\ge 0$.\nThe time derivative of the minimum value, $\\frac{d}{dt}R_{\\min}(t)|_{t=t_0}$, is equal to $\\partial_t R(x_0, t_0)$ (under suitable differentiability assumptions on the path of minimum points, which can be made rigorous using the weak maximum principle).

In any dimension, nonnegativity of the Ricci tensor is preserved by Ricci flow because each component of the Ricci tensor satisfies a scalar heat-type inequality to which the standard maximum principle applies.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two principal reasons.\nFirst, the claim of preservation in any dimension is false. While nonnegativity of the Ricci tensor ($\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$) is preserved in dimensions $n=2$ and $n=3$, counterexamples exist for dimensions $n \\ge 4$. For instance, certain homogeneous metrics on $SO(n)/SO(n-2)$ for $n \\ge 5$ with initially positive Ricci curvature are known to develop negative Ricci curvature under the flow. Similarly, there are examples on $S^2 \\times S^2$ where an initial metric with $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$ develops negative Ricci curvature.\nSecond, the proposed reasoning is flawed. The components $R_{ij}$ of the Ricci tensor do not, in general, satisfy a scalar parabolic inequality. The evolution of the Ricci tensor is governed by the tensor equation:\n$$ \\partial_t R_{ij} = \\Delta_L R_{ij} + 2R_{ikjl}R^{kl} - 2R_{ik}R^k_j $$\nwhere $\\Delta_L$ is the Lichnerowicz Laplacian. Applying the maximum principle to a single component $R_{ab}$ in a given coordinate system is not valid because the equation for $R_{ab}$ is coupled to other components through the reaction terms and potentially through the Laplacian operator itself when expressed in local coordinates (due to Christoffel symbols). The preservation of positivity for a tensor requires a more sophisticated tool, namely a maximum principle for tensors, which compares the tensor to a cone of positive tensors.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In dimension $3$, nonnegativity of the Ricci tensor is preserved under Ricci flow by Hamilton’s maximum principle for tensors, using that in dimension $3$ the Riemann curvature tensor is determined algebraically by the Ricci tensor.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes a seminal result by Richard Hamilton. The preservation of non-negative Ricci curvature in dimension $n=3$ is a critical component of his work. The proof relies on Hamilton's maximum principle for tensors evolving by a reaction-diffusion equation. The principle states that if a tensor field starts in a closed convex set invariant under the action of the orthogonal group (like the cone of non-negative symmetric $2$-tensors), it remains in that set if the reaction part of the evolution equation points \"inward\" on the boundary of the set.\n\nFor the Ricci tensor, the reaction term is $Q(R)_{ij} = 2R_{ikjl}R^{kl} - 2R_{ik}R^k_j$. In dimension $n=3$, the Riemann curvature tensor $R_{ijkl}$ is algebraically determined by the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$ and the scalar curvature $R$. A key step in Hamilton's proof is to use this special algebraic property to show that for any symmetric $2$-tensor $S_{ij}$ on the boundary of the non-negative cone (meaning its smallest eigenvalue is $0$), the reaction term $Q(S)$ is \"inward-pointing\". Specifically, if $v$ is a null eigenvector for $S$, then $Q(S)(v,v) \\ge 0$. For the Ricci tensor in $3D$, if its eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3=0$, this condition becomes $Q(\\mathrm{Ric})(v,v) = 2\\lambda_1\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$, which is true. Thus, the cone of non-negative Ricci tensors is preserved.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. If the initial curvature operator is nonnegative, then this condition is preserved along the flow; in particular the Ricci tensor remains nonnegative.**\n\nThe curvature operator is a linear map $\\mathfrak{R}: \\Lambda^2(TM) \\to \\Lambda^2(TM)$ which is non-negative if it is a positive semi-definite operator. This condition is stronger than having non-negative sectional curvature and also stronger than having a non-negative Ricci tensor. If $\\mathfrak{R} \\ge 0$, then $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$.\nRichard Hamilton proved that non-negativity of the curvature operator is preserved under Ricci flow in all dimensions. The proof is another application of the tensor maximum principle, this time to the full Riemann curvature tensor $R_{ijkl}$, viewed as an element of the space of algebraic curvature tensors. The cone of tensors with non-negative curvature operator is a suitable convex set, and the reaction term in the evolution equation for the Riemann tensor is shown to satisfy the required positivity condition on the boundary of this cone.\nSince $\\mathfrak{R}(t) \\ge 0$ is preserved, and this condition implies $\\mathrm{Ric}(t) \\ge 0$, it follows that if $\\mathfrak{R}(0) \\ge 0$, then $\\mathrm{Ric}(t) \\ge 0$ for all $t > 0$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. If at time $t=0$ the smallest eigenvalue of the Ricci tensor is positive at one point, then by the maximum principle it becomes positive everywhere for all $t>0$.**\n\nThis is a fundamental misinterpretation of the maximum principle. The (weak) maximum principle states that if a function $u(x,t)$ satisfies a suitable parabolic inequality and its initial values are bounded below by a constant $c$ everywhere on the manifold, i.e., $u(x,0) \\ge c$ for all $x \\in M$, then $u(x,t) \\ge c$ for all $x \\in M$ and $t > 0$. The strong maximum principle can upgrade this to a strict inequality $u(x,t) > c$ for $t > 0$ under certain conditions, but it still requires the initial data to be bounded below by $c$ everywhere.\nThe statement only assumes positivity at a single point. The Ricci tensor could have negative eigenvalues elsewhere on the manifold at $t=0$. The maximum principle provides no mechanism to prevent these negative eigenvalues from persisting or the minimum eigenvalue from remaining negative.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. The function $\\lambda_{\\min}(x,t)$ given by the smallest eigenvalue of the Ricci tensor at $(x,t)$ satisfies a scalar differential inequality of the form $\\partial_t \\lambda_{\\min} \\ge \\Delta \\lambda_{\\min} + 2\\,\\lambda_{\\min}^{2}$, so the standard scalar maximum principle preserves $\\lambda_{\\min} \\ge 0$ in all dimensions.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for multiple reasons.\nFirst, the conclusion is false. As established in the analysis of option B, non-negativity of the Ricci tensor, and thus the condition $\\lambda_{\\min} \\ge 0$, is not preserved in all dimensions (it fails for $n \\ge 4$).\nSecond, the differential inequality is not correct in general dimensions. The evolution inequality for the lowest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_{\\min}$ of the Ricci tensor at a point where the minimum is achieved is of the form:\n$$ \\partial_t \\lambda_1 \\ge \\Delta \\lambda_1 + 2 \\sum_{k=2}^n K(e_1, e_k) \\lambda_k - 2\\lambda_1^2 $$\nwhere $\\lambda_k$ are the other eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor and $K(e_1, e_k)$ are the sectional curvatures of planes spanned by the corresponding eigenvectors. The stated inequality $\\partial_t \\lambda_{\\min} \\ge \\Delta \\lambda_{\\min} + 2\\lambda_{\\min}^2$ omits the summation term and, more critically, has the incorrect sign for the quadratic term.\nIt is a noteworthy fact that in dimension $n=2$, the Ricci flow simplifies significantly and the evolution of the minimum (and only) eigenvalue of the Ricci tensor, $\\lambda_{\\min} = K = R/2$, is given by the equality:\n$$ \\partial_t \\lambda_{\\min} = \\Delta \\lambda_{\\min} + 2\\lambda_{\\min}^2 $$\nSo, while the inequality (as an equality) holds in $n=2$, it is not general.

The goal is to build, near $ (x_0,t_0) $, a function $ b_\\varepsilon \\in C^\\infty $ such that:\n- $ b_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) \\ge \\eta(d_{t_0}(\\cdot)) $ in a neighborhood of $ x_0 $ and $ b_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) = \\eta(d_{t_0}(x_0)) $, so $ b_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) $ is a local upper barrier for $ \\eta(d_{t_0}) $ at $ x_0 $,\n- and $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_\\varepsilon \\ge -C $ in a neighborhood of $ (x_0,t_0) $, for some constant $ C $ depending only on $ K $ and $ \\eta $ on a controlled range.\n\nWhich of the following constructions correctly implements the Calabi trick to produce such a $ C^\\infty $ barrier at $ (x_0,t_0) $, with the stated compatibility with the parabolic operator?\n\nA. Choose a unit-speed minimizing geodesic $ \\gamma:[0,d_{t_0}(x_0)]\\to M $ for $ g(t_0) $ from $ p $ to $ x_0 $, set $ p_\\varepsilon := \\gamma(\\varepsilon) $ for $ \\varepsilon \\in (0, d_{t_0}(x_0)) $, and define $ \\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) := d_{g(t)}(x,p_\\varepsilon) $. Then set $ b_\\varepsilon(x,t) := \\eta\\!\\big(\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) + \\varepsilon\\big) $. For $ \\varepsilon $ sufficiently small, $ \\rho_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) $ is smooth near $ x_0 $, satisfies $ \\rho_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) + \\varepsilon = d_{t_0}(x_0) $ and $ \\rho_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) + \\varepsilon \\ge d_{t_0}(\\cdot) $ near $ x_0 $, and one has a local bound $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_\\varepsilon \\ge -C $ with $ C $ depending on $ K $, $ \\eta' $, $ \\eta'' $, and a local bound on $ \\rho_\\varepsilon $.\n\nB. Fix normal coordinates at $ x_0 $ for $ g(t_0) $, mollify $ d_{t_0} $ by Euclidean convolution to $ d_{t_0}^\\delta \\in C^\\infty $, and define $ b_\\delta(x,t) := \\eta(d_{t_0}^\\delta(x)) $, which is smooth and, because convolution commutes with the Laplace–Beltrami operator near $ x_0 $, satisfies $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_\\delta \\ge -C $ with $ C $ small when $ \\delta $ is small.\n\nC. Replace $ d_t $ by its square $ r^2(x,t) := d_{g(t)}(x,p)^2 $. Since $ r^2 $ is semiconvex and hence differentiable everywhere, $ \\eta(r^2) $ is already regular enough for the classical maximum principle, so no additional smoothing is needed and the barrier inequalities hold with $ C=0 $.\n\nD. Smooth in space-time by heat flow with respect to the fixed metric $ g(0) $: define $ h_s(\\cdot,t) $ as the $ g(0) $-heat evolution at time $ s \\in (0,1) $ of $ x \\mapsto d_{g(t)}(x,p) $, and set $ b_s(x,t) := \\eta(h_s(x,t)) $. The positivity of the $ g(0) $-heat kernel implies $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_s \\ge 0 $, so $ b_s $ is an upper barrier at $ (x_0,t_0) $.\n\nE. Extend $ \\gamma $ past $ p $ and set $ p_{-\\varepsilon} := \\gamma(-\\varepsilon) $, then define $ \\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) := d_{g(t)}(x,p_{-\\varepsilon}) $ and $ b_\\varepsilon(x,t) := \\eta(\\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) - \\varepsilon) $. By the triangle inequality, $ b_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) $ is a local upper barrier for $ \\eta(d_{t_0}) $ at $ x_0 $, and the same differential inequalities as in option A hold.", "solution": "The user wants me to validate the problem statement and, if valid, provide a detailed solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A complete Ricci flow is a one-parameter family of complete Riemannian metrics $ (M,g(t))_{t\\in[0,T]} $ solving $ \\partial_t g(t) = -2\\,\\mathrm{Ric}_{g(t)} $.\n- A point $ p\\in M $ is fixed.\n- The time-$ t $ distance function is $ d_t(x) := d_{g(t)}(x,p) $.\n- A function is defined as $ w(x,t) := u(x,t) - \\eta(d_t(x)) $, where $ u \\in C^{2} $ and $ \\eta \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}) $ is nondecreasing ($ \\eta' \\ge 0 $) and convex ($ \\eta'' \\ge 0 $).\n- A point $ (x_0,t_0)\\in M\\times(0,T] $ is a local maximum of $ w $.\n- Near $ (x_0,t_0) $, the Ricci curvature is bounded: $ \\lvert \\mathrm{Ric}_{g(t)}\\rvert \\le K $ for some $ K \\in [0,\\infty) $.\n- Near $ (x_0,t_0) $, Laplacian comparison holds for a distance function $ r $: $ \\Delta_{g(t)} r \\le C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r} $, with constants $ C_1, C_2 $ depending on $ K $.\n- The goal is to construct a $ C^\\infty $ function $ b_\\varepsilon $ near $ (x_0,t_0) $ with three properties:\n    1. $ b_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) \\ge \\eta(d_{t_0}(\\cdot)) $ in a neighborhood of $ x_0 $.\n    2. $ b_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) = \\eta(d_{t_0}(x_0)) $.\n    3. $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_\\varepsilon \\ge -C $ in a neighborhood of $ (x_0,t_0) $, for some constant $ C $.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes a standard technical issue and its resolution in the application of the maximum principle in geometric analysis, specifically for equations on evolving manifolds like the Ricci flow. The non-smoothness of the distance function $ d_t $ at the cut locus is a well-known difficulty. The Calabi trick, or Calabi's argument, is a standard and powerful technique to circumvent this by constructing a smooth local support function.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly located within the modern theory of Ricci flow and geometric partial differential equations. The concepts used—Ricci flow, distance functions, Laplacian comparison, maximum principles, and the Calabi trick—are all standard and well-established in differential geometry. The setup is a faithful representation of the arguments found in seminal works by Hamilton, Perelman, and others.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to identify which of the given constructions correctly implements the desired technique. This is a clear and well-posed question. The desired properties of the constructed function $ b_\\varepsilon $ are explicitly listed.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise, using standard mathematical terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary information to evaluate the options. The assumptions of bounded curvature and Laplacian comparison are standard hypotheses in this context.\n\nThe problem statement has no identifiable flaws. It is a valid and well-formulated problem in advanced differential geometry.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed to derive the solution by analyzing each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a smooth function $ b_\\varepsilon(x,t) $ that acts as a local upper barrier for $ \\eta(d_t(x)) $ at the point $ (x_0, t_0) $ and whose behavior under the parabolic operator $ \\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)} $ can be controlled. Such a function allows the maximum principle to be applied to $ u - b_\\varepsilon $ instead of the non-smooth $ u - \\eta(d_t) $.\n\nLet's analyze each proposed construction.\n\n#### Analysis of Option A\n\n- **Construction:** A unit-speed minimizing geodesic $ \\gamma:[0,d_{t_0}(x_0)]\\to M $ for the metric $ g(t_0) $ is chosen from $ p=\\gamma(0) $ to $ x_0=\\gamma(d_{t_0}(x_0)) $. For a small $ \\varepsilon > 0 $, the pole is shifted to $ p_\\varepsilon := \\gamma(\\varepsilon) $. The new distance function is $ \\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) := d_{g(t)}(x,p_\\varepsilon) $. The barrier function is defined as $ b_\\varepsilon(x,t) := \\eta\\!\\big(\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) + \\varepsilon\\big) $.\n\n- **Barrier Properties at $ t=t_0 $:**\n    1.  We check the equality at $ x_0 $. The point $ x_0 $ and the new pole $ p_\\varepsilon $ both lie on the geodesic $ \\gamma $. Assuming this segment of $ \\gamma $ is minimizing for $ g(t_0) $, the distance is $ \\rho_\\varepsilon(x_0, t_0) = d_{g(t_0)}(x_0, p_\\varepsilon) = d_{g(t_0)}(\\gamma(d_{t_0}(x_0)), \\gamma(\\varepsilon)) = d_{t_0}(x_0) - \\varepsilon $.\n        Then, $ b_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) = \\eta(\\rho_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) + \\varepsilon) = \\eta((d_{t_0}(x_0) - \\varepsilon) + \\varepsilon) = \\eta(d_{t_0}(x_0)) $. This matches the requirement.\n    2.  We check the inequality. By the triangle inequality for the metric $ g(t_0) $: $ d_{t_0}(x,p) \\le d_{t_0}(x,p_\\varepsilon) + d_{t_0}(p_\\varepsilon,p) $.\n        This translates to $ d_{t_0}(x) \\le \\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t_0) + \\varepsilon $, since $ d_{t_0}(p_\\varepsilon,p) = \\varepsilon $.\n        Because $ \\eta $ is nondecreasing ($ \\eta' \\ge 0 $), we have $ \\eta(d_{t_0}(x)) \\le \\eta(\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t_0) + \\varepsilon) = b_\\varepsilon(x,t_0) $. This confirms $ b_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) $ is an upper barrier for $ \\eta(d_{t_0}) $.\n\n- **Smoothness:** For any $ x_0 \\ne p $, we can choose $ \\varepsilon > 0 $ small enough such that $ x_0 $ is not in the cut locus of $ p_\\varepsilon $ with respect to the metric $ g(t_0) $. The minimizing geodesic from $ p_\\varepsilon $ to $ x_0 $ is unique and is simply the segment of $ \\gamma $ from $ \\gamma(\\varepsilon) $ to $ \\gamma(d_{t_0}(x_0)) $. Thus, $ \\rho_\\varepsilon(\\cdot, t_0) $ is smooth in a neighborhood of $ x_0 $. This smoothness persists for $ t $ near $ t_0 $. Thus $ b_\\varepsilon $ is a $ C^\\infty $ function in a neighborhood of $ (x_0, t_0) $.\n\n- **Parabolic Operator Bound:** Let $ f(x,t) = \\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) + \\varepsilon $. We calculate $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_\\varepsilon $.\n    $ \\partial_t b_\\varepsilon = \\eta'(f) \\partial_t \\rho_\\varepsilon $\n    $ \\Delta_{g(t)} b_\\varepsilon = \\eta''(f) |\\nabla_{g(t)} f|^2 + \\eta'(f) \\Delta_{g(t)} f = \\eta''(f) |\\nabla_{g(t)} \\rho_\\varepsilon|^2 + \\eta'(f) \\Delta_{g(t)} \\rho_\\varepsilon $.\n    Away from $ p_\\varepsilon $ and its cut locus, $ |\\nabla_{g(t)} \\rho_\\varepsilon| = 1 $.\n    $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_\\varepsilon = \\eta'(f) (\\partial_t \\rho_\\varepsilon - \\Delta_{g(t)} \\rho_\\varepsilon) - \\eta''(f) $.\n    Using the standard estimates for distance functions under Ricci flow, we have:\n    - First variation formula for arc length under Ricci flow gives $ \\partial_t \\rho_\\varepsilon = -\\int_0^{\\rho_\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{Ric}_{g(t)}(\\dot\\sigma, \\dot\\sigma) \\, ds $ along a minimizing geodesic $ \\sigma $. With $ |\\mathrm{Ric}| \\le K $, this implies $ \\partial_t \\rho_\\varepsilon \\ge -K \\rho_\\varepsilon $.\n    - The problem provides the Laplacian comparison estimate: $ \\Delta_{g(t)} \\rho_\\varepsilon \\le C_1 + C_2/\\rho_\\varepsilon $.\n    Since $ \\eta' \\ge 0 $, we can combine these:\n    $ \\partial_t \\rho_\\varepsilon - \\Delta_{g(t)} \\rho_\\varepsilon \\ge -K \\rho_\\varepsilon - (C_1 + C_2/\\rho_\\varepsilon) $.\n    Given that $ \\eta'' \\ge 0 $, we get the lower bound:\n    $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) b_\\varepsilon \\ge \\eta'(f) [-K \\rho_\\varepsilon - C_1 - C_2/\\rho_\\varepsilon] - \\eta''(f) $.\n    In a small neighborhood of $ (x_0, t_0) $, the value of $ \\rho_\\varepsilon $ is close to $ d_{t_0}(x_0) - \\varepsilon $, which is positive and bounded away from $ 0 $ (assuming $ x_0 \\ne p $, as is implicit). The functions $ \\eta' $ and $ \\eta'' $ are evaluated on a compact interval of values and are therefore bounded. Thus, the entire right-hand side is bounded below by a constant $ -C $.\n\nThis construction fulfills all the specified requirements. It is the classic Calabi trick.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** **Correct**.\n\n#### Analysis of Option B\n\nThe construction $ b_\\delta(x,t) := \\eta(d_{t_0}^\\delta(x)) $ defines a function that is independent of time, $ \\partial_t b_\\delta = 0 $. The smoothing is done with respect to the fixed spatial metric $ g(t_0) $. The parabolic operator, however, involves the time-dependent Laplacian $ \\Delta_{g(t)} $. There is no simple relationship between $ \\Delta_{g(t)} $ and the fixed-metric convolution used to define $ d_{t_0}^\\delta $. The claim that convolution \"commutes\" with the Laplace-Beltrami operator is, in this context, false and meaningless. The structure of the barrier function must reflect the time-evolving geometry, which this construction fails to do.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Analysis of Option C\n\nThis option claims that $ r^2(x,t) = d_{g(t)}(x,p)^2 $ is differentiable everywhere. This is false. The squared distance function is generally not $ C^1 $ at the cut locus. While it is semiconvex, this does not imply differentiability. The gradient can be discontinuous where minimizing geodesics from $ p $ cross. Furthermore, the claim that inequalities hold with $ C=0 $, i.e., $ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)}) \\eta(r^2) \\ge 0 $, is unsubstantiated and generally false. A calculation shows the expression involves terms like $ (\\partial_t r - \\Delta r) $ and $ -r^2\\eta''(r^2) $, which do not sum to a non-negative quantity in general.\n\n**Conclusion for C:** **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Analysis of Option D\n\nThis option suggests smoothing in space using the heat flow associated with a *fixed* background metric $ g(0) $. This approach suffers from a similar flaw to option B. It mixes two incompatible geometric structures: the heat kernel of $ g(0) $ and the parabolic operator $ \\partial_t - \\Delta_{g(t)} $ which depends on the evolving metric $ g(t) $. There is no reason to believe that the resulting function $ b_s(x,t) $ would satisfy the desired differential inequality. The operators $ \\partial_t $, $ \\Delta_{g(t)} $, and the integral operator defined by the $ g(0) $-heat kernel do not interact in the simple way required to prove the claim.\n\n**Conclusion for D:** **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Analysis of Option E\n\n- **Construction:** The pole is shifted \"backwards\" to $ p_{-\\varepsilon} := \\gamma(-\\varepsilon) $. The new distance is $ \\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) := d_{g(t)}(x,p_{-\\varepsilon}) $. The barrier is $ b_\\varepsilon(x,t) := \\eta(\\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t) - \\varepsilon) $.\n\n- **Barrier Properties at $ t=t_0 $:**\n    1.  At $ x_0 $, the distance is $ \\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) = d_{t_0}(x_0,p_{-\\varepsilon}) = d_{t_0}(\\gamma(d_{t_0}(x_0)), \\gamma(-\\varepsilon)) = d_{t_0}(x_0) + \\varepsilon $.\n        Then, $ b_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) = \\eta(\\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x_0,t_0) - \\varepsilon) = \\eta((d_{t_0}(x_0) + \\varepsilon) - \\varepsilon) = \\eta(d_{t_0}(x_0)) $. The equality at $ x_0 $ holds.\n    2.  For the inequality, we use the triangle inequality: $ d_{t_0}(x, p_{-\\varepsilon}) \\le d_{t_0}(x,p) + d_{t_0}(p, p_{-\\varepsilon}) $.\n        This translates to $ \\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t_0) \\le d_{t_0}(x) + \\varepsilon $, which implies $ \\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t_0) - \\varepsilon \\le d_{t_0}(x) $.\n        Since $ \\eta $ is nondecreasing, we get $ \\eta(\\tilde\\rho_\\varepsilon(x,t_0) - \\varepsilon) \\le \\eta(d_{t_0}(x)) $, i.e., $ b_\\varepsilon(x,t_0) \\le \\eta(d_{t_0}(x)) $.\n        This shows that $ b_\\varepsilon $ is a local *lower* barrier for $ \\eta(d_{t_0}) $, not an *upper* barrier as required by the problem statement ($ b_\\varepsilon(\\cdot,t_0) \\ge \\eta(d_{t_0}(\\cdot)) $). The direction of the inequality is wrong.\n\n**Conclusion for E:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A correctly describes the construction and properties of the barrier function required for the Calabi trick in this setting.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2983615"}]}
