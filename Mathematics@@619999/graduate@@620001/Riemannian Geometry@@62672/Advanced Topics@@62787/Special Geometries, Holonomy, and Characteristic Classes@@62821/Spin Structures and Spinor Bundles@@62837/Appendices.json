The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information to derive the requested isomorphisms and compute the specified quantities.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the structure of the Spin groups, $Spin(n)$, which are defined as subgroups of the Clifford algebra $Cl_n$. The defining relation for the Clifford algebra is given as $v^2 = -\\|v\\|^2$ for any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, which specifies the real Clifford algebra $Cl_{0,n}$. The Spin group $Spin(n)$ consists of elements in the even subalgebra $Cl_{n}^{0}$ that can be written as a product of an even number of unit vectors. A crucial property of any such element $u \\in Spin(n)$ is that its Clifford norm is $1$, i.e., $N(u) = u \\bar{u} = 1$, where the bar denotes the main anti-automorphism of the algebra (reversing the order of vectors in a product). Therefore, $Spin(n)$ can be identified with the group of norm-$1$ elements within the algebra $Cl_{n}^{0}$.\n\nThe problem requires deriving isomorphisms for $Spin(2)$, $Spin(3)$, and $Spin(4)$ and then performing specific computations. These low-dimensional cases are special due to isomorphisms between $Cl_{n}^{0}$ and other well-known algebras like the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ and the quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$. The general isomorphism $Cl_{0,n}^0 \\cong Cl_{0,n-1}$ provides a conceptual through-line.\n\n**Derivation of Isomorphisms**\n\n**$Spin(2) \\cong S^1$**\nFor $n=2$, $Spin(2)$ is the group of norm-$1$ elements in the even subalgebra $Cl_2^0$. Let $e_1, e_2$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The algebra $Cl_2^0$ is spanned by the basis elements $\\{1, e_1 e_2\\}$. Let us denote the bivector $i = e_1 e_2$. We compute its square: $i^2 = (e_1 e_2)(e_1 e_2) = e_1 (e_2 e_1) e_2 = e_1 (-e_1 e_2) e_2 = -e_1^2 e_2^2 = -(-1)(-1) = -1$.\nThus, the algebra $Cl_2^0$ is isomorphic to the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ via the map $1 \\mapsto 1$ and $i \\mapsto i$. An arbitrary element of $Cl_2^0$ can be written as $a \\cdot 1 + b \\cdot i$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The main anti-automorphism on $Cl_2^0$ sends $i = e_1 e_2$ to $\\overline{e_1 e_2} = e_2 e_1 = -e_1 e_2 = -i$. This corresponds to complex conjugation. The norm of an element $u = a+bi$ is $N(u) = u \\bar{u} = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2+b^2$. The condition for $u$ to be in $Spin(2)$ is $N(u)=1$, which translates to $a^2+b^2=1$. This equation defines the unit circle $S^1$ in the complex plane. Thus, $Spin(2) \\cong S^1$.\nThis conceptually follows from $Cl_2^0 \\cong Cl_{0,1}$. The algebra $Cl_{0,1}$ is generated by $e_1$ with $e_1^2=-1$, so it is directly isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}$. The norm-$1$ elements are $S^1$.\n\n**$Spin(3) \\cong SU(2)$**\nFor $n=3$, $Spin(3)$ is the group of norm-$1$ elements in $Cl_3^0$. Let $e_1, e_2, e_3$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The even subalgebra $Cl_3^0$ is a $4$-dimensional real algebra with basis $\\{1, e_1 e_2, e_2 e_3, e_3 e_1\\}$. Let's define $\\mathbf{i} = e_1 e_2$, $\\mathbf{j} = e_2 e_3$, and $\\mathbf{k} = e_3 e_1$. We check their multiplication rules:\n$\\mathbf{i}^2 = (e_1 e_2)^2 = -1$, $\\mathbf{j}^2 = (e_2 e_3)^2 = -1$, $\\mathbf{k}^2 = (e_3 e_1)^2 = -1$.\n$\\mathbf{ij} = (e_1 e_2)(e_2 e_3) = e_1 (e_2^2) e_3 = e_1(-1)e_3 = -e_1 e_3 = e_3 e_1 = \\mathbf{k}$.\nThe other relations, $\\mathbf{jk}=\\mathbf{i}$ and $\\mathbf{ki}=\\mathbf{j}$, follow from cyclic permutation. These are the defining relations for the quaternion algebra $\\mathbb{H}$. So, $Cl_3^0 \\cong \\mathbb{H}$.\nAn element $u \\in Cl_3^0$ is a quaternion $u = a + b\\mathbf{i} + c\\mathbf{j} + d\\mathbf{k}$. The anti-automorphism acts as quaternion conjugation: $\\bar{u} = a - b\\mathbf{i} - c\\mathbf{j} - d\\mathbf{k}$. The norm is $N(u) = u \\bar{u} = a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$. The condition $N(u)=1$ defines the set of unit quaternions, which form the group $Sp(1)$. This group is topologically the $3$-sphere $S^3$.\nThe special unitary group $SU(2)$ of $2 \\times 2$ complex unitary matrices with determinant $1$ is also known to be isomorphic to $S^3$ and hence to $Sp(1)$. The standard isomorphism $Sp(1) \\cong SU(2)$ is given by the mapping stated in the problem. Thus, $Spin(3) \\cong Sp(1) \\cong SU(2)$.\nConceptually, $Cl_3^0 \\cong Cl_2 \\cong \\mathbb{H}$. So $Spin(3)$ consists of norm-$1$ elements of $\\mathbb{H}$, which is precisely $Sp(1)$.\n\n**$Spin(4) \\cong SU(2) \\times SU(2)$**\nFor $n=4$, $Spin(4)$ is the group of norm-$1$ elements in $Cl_4^0$. This is an $8$-dimensional algebra. A key element is the volume element $\\omega = e_1 e_2 e_3 e_4$. This element commutes with any element in $Cl_4^0$, i.e., it is central in $Cl_4^0$. Its square is $\\omega^2 = (e_1 e_2 e_3 e_4)^2 = 1$.\nSince $\\omega$ is central and $\\omega^2=1$, we can define two orthogonal central idempotents: $P_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 \\pm \\omega)$. These projectors decompose the algebra $Cl_4^0$ into a direct sum of two smaller algebras: $Cl_4^0 \\cong A_+ \\oplus A_-$, where $A_{\\pm} = Cl_4^0 P_{\\pm}$. Each of these algebras $A_+$ and $A_-$ can be shown to be isomorphic to the quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$. Thus, $Cl_4^0 \\cong \\mathbb{H} \\oplus \\mathbb{H}$.\nAn element $u \\in Spin(4) \\subset Cl_4^0$ is mapped to a pair $(q_L, q_R) \\in \\mathbb{H} \\oplus \\mathbb{H}$. The norm condition $u \\bar{u} = 1$ implies that both quaternion components must be of unit norm, i.e., $N(q_L)=1$ and $N(q_R)=1$.\nTherefore, $Spin(4)$ is isomorphic to the group of pairs of unit quaternions, which is $Sp(1) \\times Sp(1)$. Using the isomorphism $Sp(1) \\cong SU(2)$, we obtain $Spin(4) \\cong SU(2) \\times SU(2)$.\nThe relation $Cl_n^0 \\cong Cl_{n-1}$ is not directly used here; instead, the specific structure of $Cl_4^0$ is key.\n\n**Concrete Computations**\n\n**1. Image of $u_2 \\in Spin(2)$:**\nThe element is $u_2 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\, i\\right)$, where $i = e_1 e_2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, Euler's formula applies:\n$$u_2 = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) i$$\nUnder the identification $Spin(2) \\cong S^1 \\subset \\mathbb{C}$, where $i \\in Cl_2^0$ corresponds to $i \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we evaluate the trigonometric functions:\n$$u_2 \\mapsto \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) i = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i$$\n\n**2.

The rank of $T\\mathbb{C}P^m$ is $2m$.

The total Chern class of a direct sum of bundles is the product of their total Chern classes. Thus:\n$$c(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus (m+1)}) = (c(\\mathcal{O}(1)))^{m+1}$$\nSince $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is a line bundle, its total Chern class is simply $1 + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = 1 + x$.

Its tangent bundle is the zero-dimensional vector space, which is trivial. All Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_k$ with $k>0$ are zero. Thus, $w_{2}(T\\mathbb{C}P^{0}) = 0$. The manifold $\\mathbb{C}P^0$ is spin. Our formula also yields this result: for $m=0$, the cohomology group $H^{2}(\\mathbb{C}P^{0};\\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$, so its generator is $h=0$. The formula gives $w_{2}(T\\mathbb{C}P^0) = ((0+1) \\bmod 2)h = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $m \\ge 1$.\nFor $m \\ge 1$, the cohomology group $H^{2}(\\mathbb{C}P^{m};\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is non-trivial, so its generator $h$ is non-zero. The condition $w_{2}(T\\mathbb{C}P^{m}) = 0$ becomes:\n$$((m+1) \\bmod 2) h = 0$$\nSince $h \\neq 0$, this requires the coefficient to be zero:\n$$(m+1) \\bmod 2 = 0$$\nThis means that $m+1$ must be an even number. This is true if and only if $m$ is an odd number.\n\nCombining the results: $\\mathbb{C}P^m$ is spin for $m=0$ (which is even) and for all positive odd integers $m$. The common statement that \"$\\mathbb{C}P^m$ is spin if and only if $m$ is odd\" usually implicitly assumes $m \\ge 1$, as the case $m=0$ is trivial. The correct conclusion for all non-negative integers is that $\\mathbb{C}P^m$ is spin if $m$ is odd or if $m=0$.\n\nThe question asks for the final answer to be the expression for the cohomology class $w_2(T\\mathbb{C}P^m)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{((m+1) \\bmod 2) h}$$", "id": "2991008"}, {"introduction": "When a manifold admits a spin structure, is it unique?

By calculating the spectrum of the Dirac operator, you will then witness firsthand how this topological choice has a direct and computable impact on analysis.", "problem": "Let $T^{n}$ denote the flat $n$-dimensional torus obtained as the quotient $T^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the lattice generated by the vectors $\\{L_{1} e_{1}, \\dots, L_{n} e_{n}\\}$ with $L_{i}  0$ and $\\{e_{1}, \\dots, e_{n}\\}$ the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Equip $T^{n}$ with the induced flat Riemannian metric $g$ so that each coordinate circle has length $L_{i}$. A spin structure on $T^{n}$ is a lift of the oriented orthonormal frame bundle (with structure group equal to the Special Orthogonal group (SO)) to a principal $\\mathrm{Spin}(n)$-bundle. On a flat torus, spin structures can be described by imposing periodic ($\\alpha_{i} = 0$) or antiperiodic ($\\alpha_{i} = \\tfrac{1}{2}$) boundary conditions along each fundamental cycle, encoded by a vector $\\alpha = (\\alpha_{1}, \\dots, \\alpha_{n}) \\in \\{0, \\tfrac{1}{2}\\}^{n}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of spin structures and the Dirac operator $D$ associated to the Levi-Civita connection and a fixed choice of Euclidean gamma matrices, do the following:\n\n- Derive the classification of spin structures on $T^{n}$ via cohomological data and explain how periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions arise from this classification.\n- Using only well-tested facts about the Dirac operator on flat manifolds, derive the full Dirac spectrum on $T^{n}$ in terms of the allowed momenta dictated by the boundary conditions encoded by $\\alpha$.\n- Specialize to the case $n = 4$ with $T^{4} = \\mathbb{R}^{4} / (L_{1} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus L_{2} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus L_{3} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus L_{4} \\mathbb{Z})$ and choose the spin structure $\\alpha = (0, \\tfrac{1}{2}, 0, \\tfrac{1}{2})$, meaning periodic boundary conditions in the $x^{1}$ and $x^{3}$ directions and antiperiodic boundary conditions in the $x^{2}$ and $x^{4}$ directions.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established theory of spin geometry, is well-posed with a clear objective, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three tasks: first, to derive the classification of spin structures on the $n$-torus $T^n$; second, to derive the spectrum of the Dirac operator on $T^n$; and third, to compute the smallest positive eigenvalue for a specific case on $T^4$. We will address these in order.\n\n**Part 1: Classification of Spin Structures on $T^n$**\n\nAn orientable Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ admits a spin structure if and only if its second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(M)$ vanishes. The $n$-torus $T^n$, being a product of $n$ circles $S^1$, has a trivial tangent bundle, $TT^n \\cong T^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$. A trivial vector bundle has all its Stiefel-Whitney classes equal to zero. In particular, $w_2(T^n) = 0$, so spin structures on $T^n$ always exist.\n\nWhen $w_2(M) = 0$, the set of inequivalent spin structures on $M$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the first cohomology group with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, $H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. For the $n$-torus $T^n \\cong (S^1)^n$, the Künneth formula for cohomology gives:\n$$H^1(T^n; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$$\nSince $H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, we have $H^1(T^n; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^n$. This shows there are $2^n$ distinct spin structures on $T^n$.\n\nTo understand how these relate to boundary conditions, we consider spinor fields. A spinor field $\\psi$ on $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\Lambda$ can be represented as a function $\\tilde{\\psi}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\Delta_n$ (where $\\Delta_n$ is the complex spinor representation space) that satisfies a transformation property reflecting the quotient structure. For any lattice vector $v \\in \\Lambda$, the point $x+v$ is identified with $x$. A spinor field must satisfy $\\tilde{\\psi}(x+v) = \\rho(v) \\tilde{\\psi}(x)$, where $\\rho(v) \\in \\mathrm{Spin}(n)$ is a lift of the parallel transport of frames in SO($n$) along the path corresponding to $v$. Since the torus is flat, the holonomy in SO($n$) is trivial, meaning the parallel transport is the identity. Thus, $\\rho(v)$ must be in the kernel of the covering map $\\mathrm{Spin}(n) \\to \\mathrm{SO}(n)$, which is the two-element group $\\{+1, -1\\}$.\n\nThe map $\\rho: \\Lambda \\to \\{+1, -1\\}$ must be a group homomorphism. The lattice $\\Lambda$ is generated by the vectors $\\{L_1 e_1, \\dots, L_n e_n\\}$, so $\\Lambda \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$. A homomorphism from $\\Lambda$ is completely determined by its values on these $n$ generators. Let $\\rho(L_i e_i) = s_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$ for each $i=1, \\dots, n$. There are $2^n$ ways to choose the sequence $(s_1, \\dots, s_n)$, which corresponds to the $2^n$ spin structures.\n\nThe problem parameterizes these choices by a vector $\\alpha = (\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n) \\in \\{0, \\tfrac{1}{2}\\}^n$, defining the sign as $s_i = (-1)^{2\\alpha_i}$.\nIf $\\alpha_i = 0$, then $s_i = (-1)^0 = +1$. The boundary condition is $\\tilde{\\psi}(x + L_i e_i) = \\tilde{\\psi}(x)$, which is periodic.\nIf $\\alpha_i = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, then $s_i = (-1)^1 = -1$. The boundary condition is $\\tilde{\\psi}(x + L_i e_i) = -\\tilde{\\psi}(x)$, which is antiperiodic.\nThis establishes the connection between the cohomological classification and the periodic/antiperiodic boundary conditions.\n\n**Part 2: Dirac Spectrum on $T^n$**\n\nThe Dirac operator on a Riemannian manifold is given by $D = \\sum_j \\gamma^j \\nabla_{e_j}$, where $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection and $\\{\\gamma^j\\}$ are gamma matrices satisfying the Clifford algebra relation. For the flat metric on $T^n$, the Levi-Civita connection in the standard coordinate frame is simply the partial derivative, $\\nabla_{e_j} = \\partial_j = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. Thus, $D = \\sum_j \\gamma^j \\partial_j$.\n\nThe square of the Dirac operator is related to the Laplacian by the Lichnerowicz formula: $D^2 = \\nabla^*\\nabla + \\frac{1}{4} R$, where $\\nabla^*\\nabla$ is the connection Laplacian and $R$ is the scalar curvature. For the flat torus, $R=0$. The connection Laplacian on spinors is $\\nabla^*\\nabla = -\\sum_j \\nabla_{e_j}^2 = -\\sum_j \\partial_j^2 = -\\Delta_{flat}$, where $\\Delta_{flat}$ is the standard flat Laplacian on components. So, $D^2 = -\\Delta_{flat}$.\n\nTo find the spectrum of $D$, we can find the eigenvalues of $-\\Delta_{flat}$. The eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the torus are plane waves $\\psi_k(x) = u_k e^{i k \\cdot x}$, where $u_k$ is a constant spinor and $k$ is an allowed momentum vector. The boundary condition $\\psi(x + L_j e_j) = (-1)^{2\\alpha_j} \\psi(x)$ implies:\n$$u_k e^{i k \\cdot (x + L_j e_j)} = (-1)^{2\\alpha_j} u_k e^{i k \\cdot x}$$\n$$e^{i k \\cdot x} e^{i k_j L_j} = e^{i \\pi (2\\alpha_j)} e^{i k \\cdot x}$$\nThis requires $k_j L_j = 2\\pi\\alpha_j + 2\\pi m_j$ for some integer $m_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the allowed momentum components are quantized:\n$$k_j = \\frac{2\\pi}{L_j} (m_j + \\alpha_j), \\quad m_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nNow we apply the Laplacian to such an eigenfunction:\n$$-\\Delta_{flat} \\psi_k = -\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\partial_j^2\\right) (u_k e^{i k \\cdot x}) = -\\sum_{j=1}^n (ik_j)^2 \\psi_k = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2\\right) \\psi_k = |k|^2 \\psi_k$$\nSo the eigenvalues of $D^2$ are $|k|^2 = \\sum_j k_j^2$. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $D$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $D^2$. Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = |k|^2$, which implies $\\lambda = \\pm|k|$.\nThe full Dirac spectrum on $T^n$ with spin structure $\\alpha$ is given by the set of all such possible values:\n$$ \\text{Spec}(D) = \\left\\{ \\pm \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L_j}(m_j + \\alpha_j)\\right)^2} \\quad \\middle| \\quad (m_1, \\dots, m_n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\right\\} $$\n\n**Part 3: Smallest Positive Eigenvalue on $T^4$**\n\nWe now specialize to the case $n=4$ with the spin structure given by $\\alpha = (0, \\tfrac{1}{2}, 0, \\tfrac{1}{2})$. The eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are $\\pm|k|$, where $|k|^2$ is given by:\n$$|k|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^4 k_j^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L_1}(m_1 + 0)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L_2}(m_2 + \\tfrac{1}{2})\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L_3}(m_3 + 0)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L_4}(m_4 + \\tfrac{1}{2})\\right)^2$$\n$$|k|^2 = (2\\pi)^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{m_1}{L_1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{m_2 + 1/2}{L_2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{m_3}{L_3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{m_4 + 1/2}{L_4}\\right)^2 \\right]$$\nwhere $m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe seek the smallest positive eigenvalue, which corresponds to the minimum non-zero value of $|k|$. This is found by minimizing $|k|^2$ over all integer vectors $(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4)$. Since $|k|^2$ is a sum of non-negative terms, we must minimize each term individually.\n\nFor the terms with $\\alpha_j = 0$:\nThe minimum value of $(\\frac{m_1}{L_1})^2$ is $0$, achieved at $m_1=0$.\nThe minimum value of $(\\frac{m_3}{L_3})^2$ is $0$, achieved at $m_3=0$.\n\nFor the terms with $\\alpha_j = \\tfrac{1}{2}$:\nThe term $(\\frac{m_2 + 1/2}{L_2})^2$ is minimized when $|m_2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}|$ is minimized. For $m_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the minimum value of $|m_2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}|$ is $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, which occurs for $m_2 = 0$ or $m_2 = -1$. The minimum value of this term is $(\\frac{1/2}{L_2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4L_2^2}$.\nSimilarly, the minimum value of $(\\frac{m_4 + 1/2}{L_4})^2$ is $\\frac{1}{4L_4^2}$, achieved for $m_4 = 0$ or $m_4 = -1$.\n\nSince the terms involving $m_2$ and $m_4$ can never be zero, the minimum value of $|k|^2$ is strictly positive. The minimum is obtained by setting $m_1=0$ and $m_3=0$, and choosing $m_2$ and $m_4$ to minimize their respective terms.\nThe minimum value of $|k|^2$ is therefore:\n$$|k|_{\\text{min}}^2 = (2\\pi)^2 \\left[ 0 + \\frac{1}{4L_2^2} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4L_4^2} \\right] = \\pi^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{L_2^2} + \\frac{1}{L_4^2} \\right)$$\nThe smallest positive eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\text{min,+}}$, is the square root of this value:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{min,+}} = \\sqrt{|k|_{\\text{min}}^2} = \\sqrt{\\pi^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{L_2^2} + \\frac{1}{L_4^2}\\right)} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{L_2^2} + \\frac{1}{L_4^2}}$$\nThis is the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Dirac operator for the given spin structure on $T^4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{L_2^2} + \\frac{1}{L_4^2}}}\n$$", "id": "2990995"}]}
