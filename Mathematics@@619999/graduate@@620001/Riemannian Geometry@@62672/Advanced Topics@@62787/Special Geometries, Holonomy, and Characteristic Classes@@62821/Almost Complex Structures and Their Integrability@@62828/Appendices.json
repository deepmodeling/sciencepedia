Vector fields belonging to $T^{1,0}$ are called type-$(1,0)$ fields and satisfy $J_0X=iX$. Vector fields in $T^{0,1}$ are type-$(0,1)$ fields and satisfy $J_0Y=-iY$.\n\nAny vector field $Z \\in \\Gamma(TM \\otimes \\mathbb{C})$ can be uniquely decomposed as $Z = Z^{1,0} + Z^{0,1}$, where $Z^{1,0} \\in \\Gamma(T^{1,0})$ and $Z^{0,1} \\in \\Gamma(T^{0,1})$. The Nijenhuis tensor is bilinear over the ring of smooth functions. We can therefore compute its value by considering pairs of vector fields of pure type.\n\nCase 1: $X$ is type-$(1,0)$ and $Y$ is type-$(0,1)$.\nWe have $J_0X = iX$ and $J_0Y = -iY$. Substituting this into the definition of $N_{J_0}$:\n$$\nN_{J_0}(X,Y) = [iX, -iY] - J_0[iX, Y] - J_0[X, -iY] - [X,Y]\n$$\nUsing the properties of the Lie bracket:\n$$\nN_{J_0}(X,Y) = (-i^2)[X,Y] - i J_0[X,Y] + i J_0[X,Y] - [X,Y] = [X,Y] - [X,Y] = 0\n$$\nSo, the Nijenhuis tensor vanishes for any mixed-type pair of vector fields. By symmetry $N_{J_0}(Y,X)=-N_{J_0}(X,Y)=0$.\n\nCase 2: $X$ and $Y$ are both type-$(1,0)$.\nWe have $J_0X = iX$ and $J_0Y = iY$.\n$$\nN_{J_0}(X,Y) = [iX, iY] - J_0[iX, Y] - J_0[X, iY] - [X,Y]\n$$\n$$\nN_{J_0}(X,Y) = (i^2)[X,Y] - i J_0[X,Y] - i J_0[X,Y] - [X,Y] = -[X,Y] - 2i J_0[X,Y] - [X,Y] = -2([X,Y] + iJ_0[X,Y])\n$$\nFor $N_{J_0}(X,Y)$ to be zero, we must have $J_0[X,Y] = i[X,Y]$, which means the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ must also be a type-$(1,0)$ vector field. We now verify this condition for $J_0$.\nThe coordinate basis fields of type-$(1,0)$ commute, as they are partial derivatives in a coordinate system:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^l}\\right] = 0\n$$\nThe zero vector field is trivially of type-$(1,0)$.\nNow let $X = f^k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^k}$ and $Y = g^l \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^l}$ be general type-$(1,0)$ vector fields (summation implied), where $f^k$ and $g^l$ are smooth complex-valued functions.\n$$\n[X,Y] = \\left[f^k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^k}, g^l \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^l}\\right] = \\sum_{k,l} \\left( f^k \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^k} g^l\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^l} - g^l \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^l} f^k\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^k} \\right)\n$$\nThe resulting vector field is a linear combination of the basis vectors $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^m}\\}$, and is therefore a type-$(1,0)$ field. Thus, the subbundle $T^{1,0}$ is involutive (closed under the Lie bracket). This implies $J_0[X,Y]=i[X,Y]$, and consequently $N_{J_0}(X,Y)=0$ for any two type-$(1,0)$ fields.\n\nCase 3: $X$ and $Y$ are both type-$(0,1)$.\nA similar calculation shows $N_{J_0}(X,Y) = -2([X,Y] - iJ_0[X,Y])$. This is zero if and only if $J_0[X,Y] = -i[X,Y]$, meaning $[X,Y]$ is a type-$(0,1)$ field. The argument is analogous to Case 2: $[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^l}] = 0$, and the Lie bracket of any two type-$(0,1)$ fields is another type-$(0,1)$ field. Thus $N_{J_0}(X,Y)=0$ for any two type-$(0,1)$ fields.\n\nSince any vector field $X,Y$ can be decomposed into pure-type components, and $N_{J_0}$ vanishes for all combinations of pure-type fields, by bilinearity we have:\n$$\nN_{J_0}(X,Y) = N_{J_0}(X^{1,0}+X^{0,1}, Y^{1,0}+Y^{0,1}) = N_{J_0}(X^{1,0},Y^{1,0}) + N_{J_0}(X^{1,0},Y^{0,1}) + N_{J_0}(X^{0,1},Y^{1,0}) + N_{J_0}(X^{0,1},Y^{0,1}) = 0+0+0+0=0\n$$\nTherefore, the Nijenhuis tensor of the standard almost complex structure $J_0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is identically zero.\n$$\nN_{J_0}(X,Y) = 0\n$$\nThe Newlander–Nirenberg theorem states that an almost complex structure $J$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is integrable if and only if its Nijenhuis tensor $N_J$ vanishes. An integrable almost complex structure is one that arises from a genuine complex structure on the manifold, meaning there exists an atlas of holomorphic coordinate charts. Since we have computed $N_{J_0} = 0$, we conclude that $J_0$ is an integrable almost complex structure. This aligns with the fact that $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ equipped with $J_0$ is the standard complex vector space $\\mathbb{C}^n$.\nThe computation confirms the integrability of $J_0$.

The first part requires proving the integrability of an almost complex structure on a torus. The second part asks for the computation of the dimension of a specific Dolbeault cohomology group for this torus.\n\n### Part 1: Integrability of the Almost Complex Structure\n\nAn almost complex structure $J$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is said to be integrable if it arises from a genuine complex structure on $M$. By the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem, this is equivalent to the vanishing of the Nijenhuis tensor $N_J$. The Nijenhuis tensor is a tensor field of type $(1,2)$ defined for any two vector fields $X, Y$ on $M$ as:\n$$N_J(X, Y) = [JX, JY] - J[JX, Y] - J[X, JY] - [X, Y]$$\nwhere $[\\cdot, \\cdot]$ denotes the Lie bracket of vector fields. To prove that $J$ on $T^{2n}$ is integrable, we must show that $N_J \\equiv 0$.\n\nThe torus $T^{2n}$ is constructed as the quotient $T^{2n} = \\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a rank-$2n$ lattice. The standard coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^{2n})$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ gives rise to a global frame of coordinate vector fields $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2n}}\\right\\}$. Since these vector fields are invariant under translations, they descend to a global frame of vector fields on the torus $T^{2n}$, which we will denote by $\\{\\partial_1, \\dots, \\partial_{2n}\\}$. A key property of this frame is that the vector fields commute, i.e., for any $i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 2n\\}$, we have:\n$$[\\partial_i, \\partial_j] = 0$$\n\nThe almost complex structure $J$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is given as a linear map. This means that in the standard coordinates of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, the matrix representation of $J$ with respect to the basis $\\{\\partial_1, \\dots, \\partial_{2n}\\}$ consists of constant entries. Let these matrix components be $J^k_i$. So, $J(\\partial_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2n} J^k_i \\partial_k$. Since $J$ is constant on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, it is invariant under translations by elements of $\\Lambda$, and thus descends to a well-defined tensor field on $T^{2n}$. The components $J^k_i$ of the tensor $J$ on $T^{2n}$ with respect to the global frame $\\{\\partial_i\\}$ are constant.\n\nSince $N_J$ is a tensor, to prove it is identically zero, it suffices to show that its components with respect to the frame $\\{\\partial_i\\}$ are all zero. That is, we need to compute $N_J(\\partial_i, \\partial_j)$ for all $i, j$.\n$$N_J(\\partial_i, \\partial_j) = [J\\partial_i, J\\partial_j] - J[J\\partial_i, \\partial_j] - J[\\partial_i, J\\partial_j] - [\\partial_i, \\partial_j]$$\n\nLet's evaluate each term:\n1.  The vector field $J\\partial_i$ is a linear combination of the basis fields $\\partial_k$ with constant coefficients: $J\\partial_i = \\sum_k J^k_i \\partial_k$.\n2.  The Lie bracket of two vector fields with constant components in a commuting frame is zero. For instance, let $U = \\sum_k u^k \\partial_k$ and $V = \\sum_l v^l \\partial_l$ with constant coefficients $u^k, v^l$. Then $[U,V] = \\sum_{k,l} (u^k (\\partial_k v^l) \\partial_l - v^l (\\partial_l u^k) \\partial_k) = 0$ since the derivatives of constants are zero.\n3.  Applying this observation:\n    -   $[J\\partial_i, J\\partial_j]$ involves two vector fields with constant coefficients, so $[J\\partial_i, J\\partial_j] = 0$.\n    -   $[J\\partial_i, \\partial_j]$ involves one vector field with constant coefficients and a basis vector field, so $[J\\partial_i, \\partial_j] = 0$.\n    -   Similarly, $[\\partial_i, J\\partial_j] = 0$.\n    -   As established earlier, $[\\partial_i, \\partial_j] = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these results into the expression for $N_J(\\partial_i, \\partial_j)$:\n$$N_J(\\partial_i, \\partial_j) = 0 - J(0) - J(0) - 0 = 0$$\nSince the Nijenhuis tensor vanishes on all pairs of basis vector fields, it is identically zero everywhere on $T^{2n}$. Therefore, the almost complex structure $J$ is integrable, and $(T^{2n}, J)$ is a complex manifold.\n\n### Part 2: Dimension of the Dolbeault Cohomology Group $H^{1,0}(T^{2n})$\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{1,0}(T^{2n})$. We proceed by establishing the geometric nature of the manifold and then applying Hodge theory.\n\nFirst, we show that $(T^{2n}, g, J)$ is a Kähler manifold. A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold equipped with a Hermitian metric $g$ whose associated Kähler form $\\omega$ is closed ($d\\omega=0$). The Kähler form is defined by $\\omega(X, Y) = g(JX, Y)$ for vector fields $X, Y$.\nThe metric $g$ on $T^{2n}$ is descended from the Euclidean inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In the standard orthonormal coordinates $\\{x^i\\}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, the components of the metric tensor are $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The almost complex structure $J$ is a linear map, so its components $J^k_i$ are constant. The components of the Kähler form $\\omega$ are given by:\n$$\\omega_{ij} = g(\\partial_i, J\\partial_j) = g\\left(\\partial_i, \\sum_k J^k_j \\partial_k\\right) = \\sum_k J^k_j g_{ik} = J^i_j$$\nSince the components $\\omega_{ij}$ are constant on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, the 2-form $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j} \\omega_{ij} dx^i \\wedge dx^j$ has a vanishing exterior derivative: $d\\omega = 0$. This property descends to the torus $T^{2n}$, so the induced form $\\omega$ on $T^{2n}$ is also closed.\nThe problem states that the inner product is $J$-invariant, which means $g(JX, JY)=g(X,Y)$. This ensures that $g$ is a Hermitian metric for the complex structure $J$.\nThus, $(T^{2n}, g, J)$ is a compact Kähler manifold.\n\nAccording to the prompt, we may use Hodge theory for the Dolbeault complex on a compact Kähler manifold. Hodge theory provides an isomorphism between the Dolbeault cohomology groups and the spaces of harmonic forms:\n$$H^{p,q}(M) \\cong \\mathcal{H}^{p,q}(M) = \\{\\alpha \\in \\Omega^{p,q}(M) \\mid \\Delta_{\\bar{\\partial}} \\alpha = 0\\}$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\bar{\\partial}} = \\bar{\\partial}\\bar{\\partial}^* + \\bar{\\partial}^*\\bar{\\partial}$ is the Dolbeault Laplacian. For a Kähler manifold, the Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta_d = dd^*+d^*d$ is related to the Dolbeault Laplacian by $\\Delta_d = 2\\Delta_{\\bar{\\partial}}$.\n\nWe aim to find $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{1,0}(T^{2n})$, which is equal to $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathcal{H}^{1,0}(T^{2n})$. A foundational result in complex geometry states that on a compact Kähler manifold, a $(p,0)$-form is harmonic if and only if it is a holomorphic $p$-form. For our case ($p=1$), a $(1,0)$-form $\\alpha$ is harmonic iff it is holomorphic, meaning $\\bar{\\partial}\\alpha = 0$.\n\nLet us characterize the holomorphic 1-forms on the complex torus $T^{2n}$. Since $J$ is integrable, $T^{2n}$ is a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$. As it is formed by quotienting $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ (identified with $\\mathbb{C}^n$) by a lattice, it is a complex torus. We can choose complex coordinates $z^1, \\dots, z^n$ on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ such that they are linear combinations of the real coordinates $x^1, \\dots, x^{2n}$.\nAny holomorphic 1-form $\\alpha$ on $T^{2n}$ can be written in these complex coordinates as:\n$$\\alpha = \\sum_{j=1}^n f_j(z) dz^j$$\nwhere the coefficients $f_j(z)$ are holomorphic functions on $T^{2n}$.\nSince $T^{2n}$ is a compact complex manifold, by the maximum modulus principle, any globally holomorphic function on it must be a constant. Therefore, each coefficient $f_j$ must be a complex constant, say $c_j \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\nSo, any holomorphic 1-form on $T^{2n}$ must be of the form:\n$$\\alpha = \\sum_{j=1}^n c_j dz^j$$\nThe forms $\\{dz^1, \\dots, dz^n\\}$ constitute a basis for the space of holomorphic 1-forms on $T^{2n}$. These forms are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{C}$. The dimension of this space is the number of basis vectors.\n\nTherefore, the complex dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms on $T^{2n}$ is $n$.\nSince $\\mathcal{H}^{1,0}(T^{2n})$ is the space of holomorphic 1-forms, we have:\n$$\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{1,0}(T^{2n}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathcal{H}^{1,0}(T^{2n}) = n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n}$$", "id": "2968624"}]}
