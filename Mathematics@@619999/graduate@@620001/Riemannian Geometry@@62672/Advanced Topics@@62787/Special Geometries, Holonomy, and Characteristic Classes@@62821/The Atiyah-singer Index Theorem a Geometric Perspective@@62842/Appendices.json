Let $D = d + d^{*}$ be the operator acting on the space of differential forms $\\Omega^{*}(M)$.\n\nFirst, we prove that $D$ is an elliptic operator. The principal symbol of a first-order differential operator is obtained by replacing each partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\mu}}$ with $i\\xi_{\\mu}$, where $\\xi \\in T_{x}^{*}M$ is a cotangent vector at $x \\in M$. The principal symbol of the exterior derivative $d$ is $\\sigma_{d}(x, \\xi) \\colon \\Lambda_{x}^{*} T^{*}M \\to \\Lambda_{x}^{*} T^{*}M$ given by $\\sigma_{d}(x, \\xi)(\\omega) = i(\\xi \\wedge \\omega)$. The principal symbol of its formal adjoint $d^{*}$ is $\\sigma_{d^{*}}(x, \\xi)(\\omega) = -i\\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}(\\omega)$, where $\\xi^{\\sharp}$ is the vector field dual to the $1$-form $\\xi$ with respect to the Riemannian metric $g$, and $\\iota$ denotes the interior product.\nThe principal symbol of $D = d+d^{*}$ is the sum of their individual symbols:\n$$\n\\sigma_{D}(x, \\xi) = \\sigma_{d}(x, \\xi) + \\sigma_{d^{*}}(x, \\xi) = i(\\xi \\wedge \\cdot - \\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}(\\cdot)).\n$$\nAn operator is elliptic if its principal symbol is invertible for all non-zero covectors $\\xi$. We test this by computing the square of the symbol operator. Let $c(\\xi) = \\xi \\wedge \\cdot - \\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}(\\cdot)$. We have $\\sigma_{D}(x, \\xi) = i c(\\xi)$.\nThe square is $\\sigma_{D}(x, \\xi)^{2} = i^{2} c(\\xi)^{2} = - c(\\xi)^{2}$. Let's compute $c(\\xi)^{2}$:\n$$\nc(\\xi)^{2} = (\\xi \\wedge \\cdot - \\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}(\\cdot)) \\circ (\\xi \\wedge \\cdot - \\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}(\\cdot)) = (\\xi \\wedge \\cdot)^{2} - (\\xi \\wedge \\cdot)\\circ\\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}} - \\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}\\circ(\\xi \\wedge \\cdot) + (\\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}(\\cdot))^{2}.\n$$\nAs operators on the exterior algebra, $(\\xi \\wedge \\cdot)^{2} = 0$ since $\\xi \\wedge \\xi = 0$, and $(\\iota_{\\xi^{\\sharp}}(\\cdot))^{2} = 0$. Using the Cartan identity $L_{V} = d\\iota_V + \\iota_V d$ is not direct here, but the Clifford algebra relation is key. The operator $c(\\xi)$ satisfies $c(\\xi)^2 = -(|\\xi|_g^2) \\mathrm{Id}$. Explicitly, for a form $\\omega$,\n$$\nc(\\xi)^2(\\omega) = -\\xi \\wedge (\\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}\\omega) - \\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}(\\xi \\wedge \\omega).\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}(\\xi \\wedge \\omega) = (\\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}\\xi)\\omega - \\xi \\wedge (\\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}\\omega) = |\\xi|_g^2\\omega - \\xi \\wedge (\\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}\\omega)$, we get:\n$$\nc(\\xi)^2(\\omega) = -\\xi \\wedge (\\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}\\omega) - (|\\xi|_g^2\\omega - \\xi \\wedge (\\iota_{\\xi^\\sharp}\\omega)) = -|\\xi|_g^2\\omega.\n$$\nThus, $c(\\xi)^{2} = -|\\xi|_{g}^{2}\\mathrm{Id}$. Substituting this into the expression for the symbol's square:\n$$\n\\sigma_{D}(x, \\xi)^{2} = -(-|\\xi|_{g}^{2}\\mathrm{Id}) = |\\xi|_{g}^{2}\\mathrm{Id}.\n$$\nFor any $\\xi \\neq 0$, we have $|\\xi|_{g}^{2} > 0$, so $\\sigma_{D}(x, \\xi)^{2}$ is an invertible operator (a positive scalar multiple of the identity). This implies that $\\sigma_{D}(x, \\xi)$ itself is invertible, with inverse $(\\sigma_{D}(x, \\xi))^{-1} = \\frac{1}{|\\xi|_g^2}\\sigma_D(x,\\xi)$. Therefore, $D$ is an elliptic operator.\n\nNext, we show that $D$ is essentially self-adjoint. The formal adjoint of $D$ is $D^{*} = (d+d^{*})^{*} = d^{*} + (d^{*})^{*}$. Since $M$ is a closed manifold (compact and without boundary), the adjoint of the adjoint is the original operator, i.e., $(d^{*})^{*} = d$. Thus, $D^{*} = d^{*} + d = D$. So, $D$ is formally self-adjoint. A standard result in the theory of elliptic operators states that any formally self-adjoint elliptic operator on a closed manifold is essentially self-adjoint on the domain of smooth sections.\n\nNow, we compute $D^{2}$.\n$$\nD^{2} = (d+d^{*})(d+d^{*}) = d \\circ d + d \\circ d^{*} + d^{*} \\circ d + d^{*} \\circ d^{*}.\n$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is $d^{2} = 0$. Taking the adjoint of this identity, we get $(d^{2})^{*} = (d^{*})^{2} = 0^{*} = 0$. Substituting these into the expression for $D^{2}$:\n$$\nD^{2} = 0 + d d^{*} + d^{*} d + 0 = d d^{*} + d^{*} d.\n$$\nThis is precisely the definition of the Hodge Laplacian operator $\\Delta$. Thus, $D^{2} = \\Delta$.\n\nFinally, we identify the kernels. For any form $\\alpha$ in the domain of $D$, we have the $L^{2}$-inner product:\n$$\n\\langle D\\alpha, D\\alpha \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha, D^{*}D\\alpha \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha, D^{2}\\alpha \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha, \\Delta\\alpha \\rangle.\n$$\nAn element $\\alpha$ is in $\\ker D$ if and only if $D\\alpha = 0$, which is equivalent to $\\langle D\\alpha, D\\alpha \\rangle=0$. This implies $\\langle \\alpha, \\Delta\\alpha \\rangle=0$. For an elliptic operator like $\\Delta$ on a closed manifold, $\\langle \\alpha, \\Delta\\alpha \\rangle = 0$ is equivalent to $\\Delta\\alpha=0$. Therefore, $\\ker D = \\ker \\Delta$. The kernel of the Hodge Laplacian is, by definition, the space of harmonic forms $\\mathcal{H}^{*}(M)$.\n\nThe operator $D^{+} \\colon \\Omega^{\\mathrm{even}}(M) \\to \\Omega^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M)$ is the restriction of $D$ to even-degree forms. A form $\\alpha \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{even}}(M)$ is in $\\ker D^{+}$ if and only if $D\\alpha=0$. Thus, $\\ker D^{+} = \\ker D \\cap \\Omega^{\\mathrm{even}}(M) = \\mathcal{H}^{*}(M) \\cap \\Omega^{\\mathrm{even}}(M)$, which is the space of harmonic even forms, $\\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{even}}(M)$.\n\nThe Hilbert space adjoint $(D^{+})^{*}$ maps $\\Omega^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M)$ to $\\Omega^{\\mathrm{even}}(M)$. For any $\\alpha \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{even}}(M)$ and $\\beta \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M)$, we have $\\langle D^{+}\\alpha, \\beta \\rangle = \\langle D\\alpha, \\beta \\rangle$. Since $D$ is self-adjoint, this equals $\\langle \\alpha, D\\beta \\rangle$. If $\\beta$ is a sum of odd-degree forms, $D\\beta = (d+d^{*})\\beta$ is a sum of even-degree forms. Thus, the adjoint operator $(D^{+})^{*}$ is the restriction of $D$ to $\\Omega^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M)$, i.e., $(D^{+})^{*} = D|_{\\Omega^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M)}$. The kernel of this operator, $\\ker(D^{+})^{*}$, consists of forms $\\beta \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M)$ such that $D\\beta=0$. This is precisely the space of harmonic odd forms, $\\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M)$.\n\nPart 2: Index and Euler Characteristic\n\nThe Fredholm index of $D^{+}$ is defined as $\\mathrm{ind}(D^{+}) = \\dim \\ker D^{+} - \\dim \\ker (D^{+})^{*}$. From Part 1, we have:\n$$\n\\dim \\ker D^{+} = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{even}}(M) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{2j}(M),\n$$\n$$\n\\dim \\ker (D^{+})^{*} = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{odd}}(M) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{2j+1}(M).\n$$\nThe Hodge theorem on a closed manifold states that the space of harmonic $k$-forms $\\mathcal{H}^{k}(M)$ is isomorphic to the $k$-th de Rham cohomology group $H_{\\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(M)$. The dimension of this space is the $k$-th Betti number, $b_{k}(M) = \\dim H_{\\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(M)$.\nSubstituting the Betti numbers into the index formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ind}(D^{+}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} b_{2j}(M) - \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} b_{2j+1}(M).\n$$\nThis alternating sum can be written over all degrees from $k=0$ to $k=2n=\\dim M$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ind}(D^{+}) = b_{0}(M) - b_{1}(M) + b_{2}(M) - \\dots + b_{2n}(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2n} (-1)^{k} b_{k}(M).\n$$\nThis expression is the definition of the Euler characteristic of the manifold $M$, denoted $\\chi(M)$. Therefore, we have shown that $\\mathrm{ind}(D^{+}) = \\chi(M)$. This is a special case of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.\n\nPart 3: Evaluation for $M = S^{2} \\times S^{2}$\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $\\mathrm{ind}(D^{+})$ for the manifold $M = S^{2} \\times S^{2}$. From Part 2, this is equal to the Euler characteristic $\\chi(S^{2} \\times S^{2})$. The problem specifies using the Künneth theorem for de Rham cohomology. The theorem provides a formula for the Betti numbers of a product manifold $X \\times Y$:\n$$\nb_{k}(X \\times Y) = \\sum_{p+q=k} b_{p}(X) b_{q}(Y).\n$$\nHere, our manifold is $M = S^{2} \\times S^{2}$, so $X = Y = S^{2}$.
