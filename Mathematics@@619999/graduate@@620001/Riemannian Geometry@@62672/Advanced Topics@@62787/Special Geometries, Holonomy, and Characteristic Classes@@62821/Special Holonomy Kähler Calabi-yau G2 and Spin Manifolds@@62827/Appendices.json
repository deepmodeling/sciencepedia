The problem is broken down into three parts: determining the structure of the curvature tensor, deducing the structure of the holonomy Lie algebra, and finally computing its dimension.\n\nLet the Riemannian product manifold be $(M, g) = (M_1 \\times M_2, g_1 \\oplus g_2)$. The tangent space at a point $p = (p_1, p_2) \\in M$ splits into an orthogonal direct sum $T_p M = V_1 \\oplus V_2$, where $V_1 \\cong T_{p_1}M_1$ and $V_2 \\cong T_{p_2}M_2$. The problem states that $(M_1,g_1)$ is a simply connected, irreducible Calabi-Yau threefold, and $(M_2, g_2)$ is a simply connected, irreducible hyper-Kähler $4$-manifold. This implies their holonomy groups are $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(g_1) = \\mathrm{SU}(3)$ and $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(g_2) = \\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, respectively. The corresponding dimensions of the tangent spaces are $\\dim(V_1)=6$ and $\\dim(V_2)=4$.\n\n### Part 1: Curvature Tensor of the Product Manifold\n\nThe first step is to analyze the curvature tensor $R$ of the product metric $g = g_1 \\oplus g_2$. We are given that the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$ splits. This means that if we take vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$, and decompose them as $X = X_1 + X_2$ and $Y = Y_1 + Y_2$ (where $X_i, Y_i$ are lifts of vector fields on $M_i$), then the connection acts component-wise:\n$$ \\nabla_X Y = \\nabla_{X_1+X_2}(Y_1+Y_2) = \\nabla^1_{X_1}Y_1 + \\nabla^2_{X_2}Y_2 $$\nHere, $\\nabla^1$ and $\\nabla^2$ are the Levi-Civita connections on $M_1$ and $M_2$. This implies that for vector fields from different factors, the covariant derivative is zero, e.g., $\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2 = 0$ and $\\nabla_{X_2}Y_1 = 0$. Also, for the natural lifts of vector fields, the Lie bracket of fields from different factors vanishes, i.e., $[X_1, X_2] = 0$.\n\nThe curvature tensor is defined by $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$. We evaluate this for vector fields $u, v, w$ at the point $p$ belonging to the subspaces $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\nCase 1: $u, v, w \\in V_1$. Let $U, V, W$ be local extensions to $M$ which are tangent to the $M_1$ factor. Then $\\nabla_U W = \\nabla^1_U W$, so $R(U,V)W = \\nabla^1_U\\nabla^1_V W - \\nabla^1_V\\nabla^1_U W - \\nabla^1_{[U,V]}W = R^1(U,V)W$.\n\nCase 2: $u, v, w \\in V_2$. Similarly, $R(u,v)w = R^2(u,v)w$.\n\nCase 3: Mixed vector arguments. We show that all mixed curvature terms vanish. We demonstrate two key examples.\nLet $u, v \\in V_1$ and $w \\in V_2$. Let $U, V, W$ be their corresponding local extensions.\n$$ R(U,V)W = \\nabla_{U}\\nabla_{V}W - \\nabla_{V}\\nabla_{U}W - \\nabla_{[U,V]}W $$\nSince $V$ is a field on $M_1$ and $W$ is a field on $M_2$, $\\nabla_{V}W = 0$. Similarly, $\\nabla_{U}W = 0$. The Lie bracket $[U,V]$ is a vector field on $M_1$, so $\\nabla_{[U,V]}W = 0$. Therefore, $R(u,v)w = 0$. This means the curvature operator $R(u,v)$ for $u,v \\in V_1$ maps the subspace $V_2$ to zero. A symmetric argument shows that for $u,v \\in V_2$, $R(u,v)$ maps $V_1$ to zero.\n\nLet $u \\in V_1$, $v \\in V_2$, and $w \\in T_p M = V_1 \\oplus V_2$. Let $w = w_1+w_2$.\n$$ R(U,V)W = \\nabla_{U}\\nabla_{V}W - \\nabla_{V}\\nabla_{U}W - \\nabla_{[U,V]}W $$\nFor the chosen extensions, $[U,V]=0$.\n$\\nabla_V W = \\nabla_V(W_1+W_2) = \\nabla_V W_1 + \\nabla_V W_2 = 0 + \\nabla^2_V W_2$. So $\\nabla_U(\\nabla_V W) = \\nabla_U(\\nabla^2_V W_2) = 0$.\n$\\nabla_U W = \\nabla_U(W_1+W_2) = \\nabla^1_U W_1 + \\nabla_U W_2 = \\nabla^1_U W_1 + 0$. So $\\nabla_V(\\nabla_U W) = \\nabla_V(\\nabla^1_U W_1) = 0$.\nThus, $R(u,v)w=0$. This implies any curvature endomorphism with arguments from different factors is the zero operator.\n\nIn summary, the curvature tensor $R$ at $p$ acts non-trivially only when all its arguments are in the same subspace, either $V_1$ or $V_2$. If we write $X=X_1+X_2$, $Y=Y_1+Y_2$, $Z=Z_1+Z_2$, then:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = R(X_1, Y_1)Z_1 + R(X_2, Y_2)Z_2 $$\nThis shows that $R$ at $p$ decomposes. Any curvature endomorphism $R(X,Y)$ preserves the splitting $V_1 \\oplus V_2$, acting as $R^1(X_1,Y_1)$ on $V_1$ and $R^2(X_2,Y_2)$ on $V_2$.\n\n### Part 2: Structure of the Holonomy Lie Algebra\n\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem states that the holonomy Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)$ is generated by all operators of the form $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y) P_{\\gamma}$, for all $X,Y \\in T_p M$ and all loops $\\gamma$ at $p$. Here $P_\\gamma$ is the parallel transport operator along $\\gamma$.\n\nSince the connection $\\nabla$ preserves the direct sum decomposition $T M \\cong \\pi_1^* T M_1 \\oplus \\pi_2^* T M_2$, parallel transport along any curve in $M$ must also preserve this splitting. Thus, for any loop $\\gamma$ at $p$, the operator $P_{\\gamma}$ is block-diagonal with respect to the splitting $V_1 \\oplus V_2$. This means $P_{\\gamma} \\in \\mathrm{O}(V_1) \\times \\mathrm{O}(V_2)$.\n\nLet $P_{\\gamma} = P_{\\gamma}^{(1)} \\oplus P_{\\gamma}^{(2)}$.\nThe generators of $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)$ are of the form $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y) P_{\\gamma}$.\nIf $X, Y \\in V_1$, then $P_{\\gamma}X \\in V_1$ and $P_{\\gamma}Y \\in V_1$. From Part 1, we know $R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y)$ acts as $R^1(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y)$ on $V_1$ and is zero on $V_2$. Since $P_\\gamma$ and its inverse are block-diagonal, the full operator $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y) P_{\\gamma}$ is also block-diagonal, with its non-zero part acting only on $V_1$. A similar argument holds for $X, Y \\in V_2$. If $X \\in V_1, Y \\in V_2$, the curvature operator is zero.\n\nThus, all generators of $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)$ are block-diagonal. The Lie algebra they generate must also consist of block-diagonal endomorphisms. This implies $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\oplus \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$ (identifying the algebras with their matrix representations on $V_1$ and $V_2$).\n\nTo establish equality, we use the fact that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are simply connected. Any loop $\\gamma_1$ in $M_1$ based at $p_1$ can be lifted to a loop $\\gamma = (\\gamma_1, c_{p_2})$ in $M$, where $c_{p_2}$ is the constant loop at $p_2$. The parallel transport along $\\gamma$ is $P_{\\gamma} = P_{\\gamma_1}^{1} \\oplus I_2$, where $I_2$ is the identity on $V_2$. The generators obtained from such loops and vectors $X,Y \\in V_1$ are $(P_{\\gamma_1}^{1})^{-1}R^1(P_{\\gamma_1}^{1}X, P_{\\gamma_1}^{1}Y)P_{\\gamma_1}^{1} \\oplus 0$. By the Ambrose-Singer theorem applied to $M_1$, this set of operators generates $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1)$ in the first block of the direct sum.\n\nSymmetrically, by lifting loops from $M_2$, we generate $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$ in the second block. Since the set of generators for the first block commutes with the set of generators for the second block, the Lie algebra generated by their union is their direct sum. Therefore, we conclude:\n$$ \\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g) \\cong \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\oplus \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2) $$\nThe ideals are $\\mathfrak{h}_1 = \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\oplus \\{0\\}$ and $\\mathfrak{h}_2 = \\{0\\} \\oplus \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$, which commute with each other.\n\n### Part 3: Dimension of the Holonomy Lie Algebra\n\nFrom Part 2, the dimension of the product holonomy algebra is the sum of the dimensions of the factor holonomy algebras:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1)) + \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)) $$\nThe problem states that the holonomy group of $(M_1, g_1)$ is $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$. The corresponding Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1)$ is $\\mathfrak{su}(3)$. The dimension of the special unitary Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ is $n^2-1$. For $n=3$:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{su}(3)) = 3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 $$\nThe holonomy group of $(M_2, g_2)$ is $\\mathrm{Sp}(1)$. The corresponding Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$ is $\\mathfrak{sp}(1)$. There is a well-known Lie group isomorphism $\\mathrm{Sp}(1) \\cong \\mathrm{SU}(2)$. This implies an isomorphism of their Lie algebras: $\\mathfrak{sp}(1) \\cong \\mathfrak{su}(2)$. Thus, we can compute the dimension of $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{sp}(1)) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{su}(2)) = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 $$\nFinally, the total dimension is the sum:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)) = 8 + 3 = 11 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "2990663"}, {"introduction": "Calabi-Yau manifolds, which possess $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ holonomy, are central objects in both mathematics and theoretical physics.

All provided information about a K3 surface is standard and consistent within algebraic and differential geometry. I will proceed with the computation of the Betti numbers.\n\nThe Betti numbers, $b_k$, of a compact Kähler manifold $X$ are related to its Hodge numbers, $h^{p,q}$, through the Hodge decomposition of the de Rham cohomology groups. For a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension $n$, the $k$-th Betti number is the dimension of the $k$-th de Rham cohomology group, $b_k = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^k(X, \\mathbb{C})$, and is given by the sum over all Hodge numbers $h^{p,q} = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{p,q}(X)$ such that $p+q=k$:\n$$b_k = \\sum_{p+q=k} h^{p,q}$$\nThe problem provides a compact complex surface of K3 type, for which the complex dimension is $n=2$. This implies its real dimension is $2n=4$, so we need to compute the Betti numbers $b_k$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. The computation will rely on the provided Hodge numbers and general theorems for compact Kähler manifolds.\n\nThe givens are:\n- $X$ is a compact complex surface ($n=2$).\n- $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X) = 0$).\n- The Hodge numbers are $h^{0,0} = 1$, $h^{2,2} = 1$, $h^{2,0} = 1$, $h^{0,2} = 1$, $h^{1,1} = 20$.\n- All other Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ are zero for $p+q \\le 4$.\n\nWe will also use two fundamental duality theorems:\n1.  **Poincaré Duality**: For a compact, orientable, real $m$-dimensional manifold, $b_k = b_{m-k}$. Since $X$ is a complex surface, it is orientable and has real dimension $m=4$, so $b_k = b_{4-k}$.\n2.  **Serre Duality**: For a compact complex $n$-dimensional manifold, $h^{p,q} = h^{n-p, n-q}$. For $X$, with $n=2$, this means $h^{p,q} = h^{2-p, 2-q}$.\n\nLet's compute each Betti number systematically.\n\n**Computation of $b_0$**:\nThe $0$-th Betti number for any connected manifold is $1$. A K3 surface is connected. Thus, $b_0 = 1$.\nUsing the Hodge decomposition formula:\n$$b_0 = \\sum_{p+q=0} h^{p,q} = h^{0,0}$$\nThe problem states that $h^{0,0} = 1$. This confirms that $b_0=1$.\n\n**Computation of $b_1$**:\nThe problem states that the surface $X$ is simply connected. For a general topological space, the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(X)$ is trivial, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. By the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology, the first cohomology group with complex coefficients is $H^1(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathrm{Hom}(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{C}) = 0$. The dimension of this group is the first Betti number, so $b_1 = 0$.\nWe can verify this using the Hodge numbers:\n$$b_1 = \\sum_{p+q=1} h^{p,q} = h^{1,0} + h^{0,1}$$\nThe problem states that all other Hodge numbers are zero, which implies $h^{1,0}=0$ and $h^{0,1}=0$. Therefore, $b_1 = 0+0=0$. This is consistent and verifies the first part of the identity $b_1=b_3=0$.\n\n**Computation of $b_2$**:\nUsing the Hodge decomposition:\n$$b_2 = \\sum_{p+q=2} h^{p,q} = h^{2,0} + h^{1,1} + h^{0,2}$$\nWe are given the values $h^{2,0}=1$, $h^{1,1}=20$, and $h^{0,2}=1$. Substituting these values, we find:\n$$b_2 = 1 + 20 + 1 = 22$$\nThis verifies the identity $b_2=22$ stated in the problem. The given value $h^{0,2} = 1$ is also consistent with Hodge conjugation, which requires $h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}$, as $h^{0,2} = h^{2,0} = 1$.\n\n**Computation of $b_3$**:\nWe use Poincaré duality for a compact real $4$-manifold:\n$$b_3 = b_{4-3} = b_1$$\nSince we have already established that $b_1=0$, it immediately follows that $b_3=0$. This verifies the second part of the identity $b_1=b_3=0$.\nTo confirm this with the Hodge decomposition:\n$$b_3 = \\sum_{p+q=3} h^{p,q} = h^{2,1} + h^{1,2}$$\nThe problem implies $h^{2,1}=0$ and $h^{1,2}=0$. We can also derive this using Serre duality ($h^{p,q} = h^{2-p, 2-q}$):\n$$h^{2,1} = h^{2-2, 2-1} = h^{0,1}$$\n$$h^{1,2} = h^{2-1, 2-2} = h^{1,0}$$\nSince $h^{1,0}=0$ and $h^{0,1}=0$, it follows that $h^{1,2}=0$ and $h^{2,1}=0$.\nThus, $b_3 = 0+0=0$. This is again perfectly consistent.\n\n**Computation of $b_4$**:\nUsing Poincaré duality:\n$$b_4 = b_{4-4} = b_0$$\nSince $b_0=1$, we have $b_4=1$.\nUsing the Hodge decomposition:\n$$b_4 = \\sum_{p+q=4} h^{p,q} = h^{2,2}$$\nThe problem gives $h^{2,2}=1$, which confirms that $b_4=1$. This is also consistent with Serre duality, as $h^{2,2}=h^{2-2, 2-2}=h^{0,0}=1$.\n\n**Summary of Results**:\nThe computed Betti numbers for the K3 surface $X$ are:\n- $b_0 = 1$\n- $b_1 = 0$\n- $b_2 = 22$\n- $b_3 = 0$\n- $b_4 = 1$\n\nThe ordered vector of Betti numbers is $(1, 0, 22, 0, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 22 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2990640"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the classical families of holonomy groups lie the exceptional cases, $G_2$ in dimension 7 and $\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ in dimension 8.

Since the metric $g_0$ is non-degenerate, this requires the first arguments of the inner product to be equal:\n$$\nA(u \\times_{\\varphi_0} v) = (Au) \\times_{\\varphi_0} (Av).\n$$\nThis confirms that any element $A \\in H$ preserves the cross product $\\times_{\\varphi_0}$, i.e., it is an automorphism of the algebra $(\\mathbb{R}^7, \\times_{\\varphi_0})$.\n\n**Part 2: The Lie Algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ and its Dimension**\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie group $H$ is the subspace of $\\mathfrak{so}(7)$ consisting of endomorphisms $X$ such that $\\exp(tX) \\in H$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let $A(t) = \\exp(tX)$ be a curve in $H$ with $A(0) = \\mathrm{Id}$ and $A'(0) = X$. The condition $A(t)^*\\varphi_0 = \\varphi_0$ is $\\varphi_0(A(t)u, A(t)v, A(t)w) = \\varphi_0(u,v,w)$. Differentiating this with respect to $t$ at $t=0$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\varphi_0(A(t)u, A(t)v, A(t)w) = 0.\n$$\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n$$\n\\varphi_0(Xu, v, w) + \\varphi_0(u, Xv, w) + \\varphi_0(u, v, Xw) = 0.\n$$\nThis is the condition for an endomorphism $X$ to be a derivation of the trilinear form $\\varphi_0$. Since $X \\in \\mathfrak{h} \\subset \\mathfrak{so}(7)$, $X$ is skew-symmetric, i.e., $g_0(Xx, y) + g_0(x, Xy) = 0$ for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^7$.\n\nLet's translate the derivation condition on $\\varphi_0$ to a condition on the cross product algebra.\nThe condition is $g_0((Xu) \\times_{\\varphi_0} v, w) + g_0(u \\times_{\\varphi_0} (Xv), w) + g_0(u \\times_{\\varphi_0} v, Xw) = 0$.\nUsing the skew-symmetry of $X$, the third term becomes $-g_0(X(u \\times_{\\varphi_0} v), w)$. The equation is:\n$$\ng_0((Xu) \\times_{\\varphi_0} v + u \\times_{\\varphi_0} (Xv) - X(u \\times_{\\varphi_0} v), w) = 0.\n$$\nSince this holds for all $w$ and $g_0$ is non-degenerate, we must have:\n$$\nX(u \\times_{\\varphi_0} v) = (Xu) \\times_{\\varphi_0} v + u \\times_{\\varphi_0} (Xv).\n$$\nThis is the Leibniz rule, defining $X$ as a derivation of the algebra $(\\mathbb{R}^7, \\times_{\\varphi_0})$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{h}$ is the set of skew-symmetric derivations of this algebra.\n\nThe algebra $(\\mathbb{R}^7, g_0, \\times_{\\varphi_0})$ is isomorphic to the algebra of imaginary octonions $\\mathrm{Im}(\\mathbb{O})$. A \"well-tested fact\" about the octonion algebra is that any derivation of the full octonion algebra $\\mathbb{O}$ preserves the decomposition $\\mathbb{O} = \\mathbb{R} \\cdot 1 \\oplus \\mathrm{Im}(\\mathbb{O})$ and acts on $\\mathrm{Im}(\\mathbb{O})$ as a skew-symmetric endomorphism with respect to the metric $g_0$. This means the condition $X \\in \\mathfrak{so}(7)$ is automatically satisfied for any derivation of the cross-product algebra. Therefore, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ is precisely the derivation algebra of $(\\mathbb{R}^7, \\times_{\\varphi_0})$. This algebra is the compact real form of the exceptional Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_2$.\n\nTo compute the dimension of $\\mathfrak{h} \\cong \\mathfrak{g}_2$, we can rely on another well-tested fact from Lie theory: there is a decomposition of Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{so}(7) = \\mathfrak{g}_2 \\oplus S$, where $S$ is the standard $7$-dimensional representation of $\\mathfrak{g}_2$.\nThe dimension of $\\mathfrak{so}(7)$ is $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21$.\nThis decomposition implies a decomposition of dimensions:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(7)) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}_2) + \\dim(S)\n$$\n$$\n21 = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}_2) + 7\n$$\nSolving for $\\dim(\\mathfrak{g}_2)$, we find:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{g}_2) = 14.\n$$\nThus, $\\dim(\\mathfrak{h}) = 14$.\n\n**Part 3: Conclusion on the Group H**\n\nThe Lie algebra of $H$ is $\\mathfrak{h} \\cong \\mathfrak{g}_2$, a compact simple Lie algebra of dimension $14$. Since $H$ is defined as a closed subgroup of the compact Lie group $\\mathrm{SO}(7)$, $H$ itself is a compact Lie group. It is a standard result in Lie theory that the (connected) compact Lie group whose Lie algebra is the compact real form of $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the exceptional Lie group $G_2$. The stabilizer group $H$ is known to be connected, and therefore $H$ is isomorphic to $G_2$.\nThe dimension of the group $H$ is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$.\n$$\n\\dim H = \\dim \\mathfrak{h} = 14.\n$$\nThe problem asks for this integer value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14}$$", "id": "2990643"}]}
