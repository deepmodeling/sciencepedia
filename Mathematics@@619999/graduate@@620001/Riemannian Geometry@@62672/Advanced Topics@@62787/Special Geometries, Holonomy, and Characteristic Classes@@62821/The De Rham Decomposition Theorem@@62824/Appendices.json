Let $p=(p_1, p_2)$ be a point in $M$. The tangent space at any point $q=(q_1, q_2) \\in M$ splits into an orthogonal direct sum $T_qM = T_{q_1}M_1 \\oplus T_{q_2}M_2$. We identify $T_{q_1}M_1$ with its canonical image in $T_qM$ and similarly for $T_{q_2}M_2$. The tangent bundle $TM$ can be written as a direct sum of two subbundles, which we denote $\\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\\mathcal{T}_2$, corresponding to the tangent bundles of the factors.\nA vector field $X$ on $M$ can be uniquely decomposed as $X = X_1 + X_2$, where for each $q \\in M$, $X_1(q) \\in T_{\\pi_1(q)}M_1$ and $X_2(q) \\in T_{\\pi_2(q)}M_2$. $X_i$ is a section of the subbundle $\\mathcal{T}_i$.\nBy definition of the product metric, if $X_1, Y_1$ are sections of $\\mathcal{T}_1$ and $X_2, Y_2$ are sections of $\\mathcal{T}_2$, then $g(X_1, Y_2) = 0$. Also, $g(X_1, Y_1)$ at a point $q=(q_1, q_2)$ is given by $g_1(X_1(q), Y_1(q))$, and similarly $g(X_2, Y_2)(q) = g_2(X_2(q), Y_2(q))$. For simplicity, we write $g(X_1, Y_1) = g_1(X_1, Y_1)$ and $g(X_2, Y_2) = g_2(X_2, Y_2)$, understanding these are functions on $M$ obtained by pullback.\n\n**Part 1: The Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$**\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is uniquely defined by the Koszul formula:\n$$2 g(\\nabla_X Y, Z) = X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y], Z) - g([X,Z], Y) - g([Y,Z], X)$$\nfor any vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $M$.\n\nFirst, we establish a key property of Lie brackets. If we take vector fields that are lifts from the factors (e.g., $X_1$ is a lift of a field on $M_1$ and $Y_2$ is a lift of a field on $M_2$), their Lie bracket $[X_1, Y_2]$ is zero. This can be seen in local coordinates, where the components of one field are constant with respect to the coordinates of the other manifold. Since the connection is a tensor, we can deduce its properties by applying the Koszul formula to such fields, and the results will hold generally.\n\nWe now show that the mixed covariant derivatives vanish. Let $X_1$ be a section of $\\mathcal{T}_1$ and $Y_2$ be a section of $\\mathcal{T}_2$, which we assume are lifts as described above. Let $Z=Z_1+Z_2$ be an arbitrary vector field (decomposed similarly). We compute $g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z) = g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z_1) + g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z_2)$.\nUsing the Koszul formula for $g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z_1)$:\n$2g(\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2, Z_1) = X_1(g(Y_2,Z_1)) + Y_2(g(X_1,Z_1)) - Z_1(g(X_1,Y_2)) + g([X_1,Y_2], Z_1) - g([X_1,Z_1], Y_2) - g([Y_2,Z_1], X_1)$.\n- $g(Y_2,Z_1)=0$ and $g(X_1,Y_2)=0$ due to orthogonality. Their derivatives are $0$.\n- $g(X_1,Z_1)$ is a function whose value at $(q_1,q_2)$ depends only on $q_1$. The vector field $Y_2$ (a lift from $M_2$) differentiates only with respect to the $M_2$ variables, so $Y_2(g(X_1,Z_1))=0$.\n- $[X_1, Y_2]=0$ and $[Y_2, Z_1]=0$ as they are mixed lifted fields.\n- $[X_1, Z_1]$ is a section of $\\mathcal{T}_1$, so $g([X_1,Z_1], Y_2)=0$.\nThus, all terms on the right-hand side are zero, so $g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z_1)=0$.\n\nA similar calculation for $g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z_2)$ also yields zero.\n$2g(\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2, Z_2) = X_1(g(Y_2,Z_2)) + Y_2(g(X_1,Z_2)) - Z_2(g(X_1,Y_2)) + g([X_1,Y_2], Z_2) - g([X_1,Z_2], Y_2) - g([Y_2,Z_2], X_1)$.\n- $X_1(g(Y_2,Z_2))=0$ since $g(Y_2,Z_2)$ depends only on $M_2$ coordinates.\n- $g(X_1,Z_2)=0$, $g(X_1,Y_2)=0$.\n- $[X_1,Y_2]=0$, $[X_1,Z_2]=0$.\n- $[Y_2,Z_2]$ is a section of $\\mathcal{T}_2$, so $g([Y_2,Z_2], X_1)=0$.\nAll terms are zero, so $g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z_2)=0$.\nSince $g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2, Z) = 0$ for all $Z$, we conclude $\\nabla_{X_1} Y_2 = 0$. By symmetry of the setup, $\\nabla_{Y_2} X_1 = 0$. This confirms all mixed covariant derivatives vanish.\n\nThis vanishing implies that the subbundles $\\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\\mathcal{T}_2$ are parallel. For any $X = X_1+X_2$ and any section $Y_1$ of $\\mathcal{T}_1$, $\\nabla_X Y_1 = \\nabla_{X_1+X_2} Y_1 = \\nabla_{X_1} Y_1 + \\nabla_{X_2}Y_1 = \\nabla_{X_1}Y_1$, which is a section of $\\mathcal{T}_1$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{T}_1$ is parallel, and similarly for $\\mathcal{T}_2$.\n\nFor vector fields $X_1, Y_1, Z_1$ in $\\mathcal{T}_1$, the Koszul formula for $g(\\nabla_{X_1} Y_1, Z_1)$ becomes:\n$2g( \\nabla_{X_1} Y_1, Z_1) = X_1(g(Y_1,Z_1)) + Y_1(g(X_1,Z_1)) - Z_1(g(X_1,Y_1)) + g([X_1,Y_1], Z_1) - g([X_1,Z_1], Y_1) - g([Y_1,Z_1], X_1)$.\nThis is precisely the pullback via $\\pi_1$ of the Koszul formula for $2g_1(\\nabla^1_{d\\pi_1(X_1)} d\\pi_1(Y_1), d\\pi_1(Z_1))$ on $M_1$. Thus, the connection $\\nabla$ when restricted to sections of $\\mathcal{T}_1$ is the lift of the connection $\\nabla^1$ from $M_1$. An analogous result holds for $\\mathcal{T}_2$.\nIn summary, for $X=X_1+X_2$ and $Y=Y_1+Y_2$, the connection on $M$ acts as:\n$\\nabla_X Y = \\nabla_{X_1}Y_1 + \\nabla_{X_2}Y_2$.\n\n**Part 2: Parallel Transport**\n\nLet $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_1(t), \\gamma_2(t))$ be a piecewise smooth curve in $M$ for $t \\in [0,T]$. A vector field $V(t)$ along $\\gamma$ is parallel if $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} V(t) = 0$.\nLet's decompose the velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) + \\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)$, where $\\dot{\\gamma}_i(t) \\in T_{\\gamma_i(t)}M_i$, and the vector field $V(t) = V_1(t) + V_2(t)$, where $V_i(t) \\in T_{\\gamma_i(t)}M_i$.\nUsing the properties of $\\nabla$ derived in Part 1:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} V(t) = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) + \\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)} (V_1(t) + V_2(t)) = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)}V_1(t) + \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)}V_2(t) + \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)}V_1(t) + \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)}V_2(t) $$\nThe mixed terms are zero, i.e., $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)}V_2(t)=0$ and $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)}V_1(t)=0$. The remaining terms are the covariant derivatives within the parallel subbundles, which correspond to the connections on the factor manifolds.\nSo, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} V(t) = \\nabla^1_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)} V_1(t) + \\nabla^2_{\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)} V_2(t)$.\n(Here we identify $\\nabla^i$ with its lift to the product manifold).\nThe condition for parallel transport $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} V(t) = 0$ thus splits into two independent equations because the components lie in orthogonal subbundles:\n1. $\\nabla^1_{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)} V_1(t) = 0$\n2. $\\nabla^2_{\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)} V_2(t) = 0$\nThese are precisely the equations for parallel transport along the curves $\\gamma_1(t)$ in $(M_1,g_1)$ and $\\gamma_2(t)$ in $(M_2,g_2)$.\nLet $P_\\gamma: T_{\\gamma(0)}M \\to T_{\\gamma(T)}M$ be the parallel transport map along $\\gamma$. Let $v = (v_1, v_2) \\in T_{\\gamma(0)}M$. The parallel transport of $v$ is the vector $V(T)$ where $V(t)$ solves $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)}V(t)=0$ with $V(0)=v$.\nThe solution is $V(t)=(V_1(t), V_2(t))$ where $V_1(t)$ is the parallel transport of $v_1$ along $\\gamma_1$ and $V_2(t)$ is the parallel transport of $v_2$ along $\\gamma_2$.\nLet $P^i_{\\gamma_i}: T_{\\gamma_i(0)}M_i \\to T_{\\gamma_i(T)}M_i$ be the parallel transport map on $M_i$.\nThen $V_1(T) = P^1_{\\gamma_1} v_1$ and $V_2(T) = P^2_{\\gamma_2} v_2$.\nThus, for a loop $\\gamma$ based at $p=(p_1,p_2)$, the parallel transport map $P_\\gamma$ acts on $v=(v_1, v_2) \\in T_pM$ as:\n$$ P_\\gamma(v_1, v_2) = (P^1_{\\gamma_1} v_1, P^2_{\\gamma_2} v_2) $$\nThis means $P_\\gamma$ acts as a block-diagonal operator on $T_pM = T_{p_1}M_1 \\oplus T_{p_2}M_2$.\n\n**Part 3: The Holonomy Group**\n\nThe holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$ is the group of transformations of $T_pM$ obtained by parallel transport along all piecewise smooth loops based at $p$.\nFrom Part 2, any element $P_\\gamma \\in \\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$ corresponds to a loop $\\gamma=(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2)$ and acts as $(P^1_{\\gamma_1}, P^2_{\\gamma_2})$. The transformation $P^1_{\\gamma_1}$ is an element of $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1)$, and $P^2_{\\gamma_2}$ is an element of $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$.\nThis shows that $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$ is a subgroup of the direct product of the holonomy groups of the factors, viewed as a group of block-diagonal transformations:\n$$ \\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g) \\subseteq \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2) $$\nTo prove the reverse inclusion, we must show that any transformation $(A_1, A_2)$, where $A_1 \\in \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1)$ and $A_2 \\in \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$, is an element of $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$.\nBy definition of holonomy, there exists a loop $\\alpha_1$ in $M_1$ based at $p_1$ such that $P^1_{\\alpha_1} = A_1$. Consider the loop $\\gamma' = (\\alpha_1, c_{p_2})$ in $M$, where $c_{p_2}$ is the constant loop at $p_2$. The parallel transport along $\\gamma'$ is $P_{\\gamma'} = (P^1_{\\alpha_1}, P^2_{c_{p_2}}) = (A_1, \\mathrm{Id}_{T_{p_2}M_2})$, where $\\mathrm{Id}$ is the identity map. Since $P_{\\gamma'}$ is generated by a loop in $M$, it belongs to $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$.\nSimilarly, there exists a loop $\\alpha_2$ in $M_2$ based at $p_2$ such that $P^2_{\\alpha_2} = A_2$. The loop $\\gamma'' = (c_{p_1}, \\alpha_2)$ in $M$ gives the parallel transport operator $P_{\\gamma''} = (P^1_{c_{p_1}}, P^2_{\\alpha_2}) = (\\mathrm{Id}_{T_{p_1}M_1}, A_2)$, which is also in $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$.\nSince $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$ is a group, the composition of these two operators must also be in the group:\n$$ P_{\\gamma'} \\circ P_{\\gamma''} = (A_1, \\mathrm{Id}) \\circ (\\mathrm{Id}, A_2) = (A_1, A_2) $$\nThis composition corresponds to the parallel transport along the concatenated loop $\\gamma'' * \\gamma'$. Therefore, any element $(A_1, A_2)$ of the product group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$ is in $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g)$.\nCombining both inclusions, we conclude:\n$$ \\mathrm{Hol}_p(M,g) = \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)}$$", "id": "2994459"}, {"introduction": "Building on the general principle, this exercise provides a concrete setting to see the de Rham decomposition in action.

We will address the three parts of the problem in sequence.\n\n1.  We first demonstrate that the canonical splitting of the tangent bundle $T(S^2 \\times S^2) = E_1 \\oplus E_2$ is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$. Let $(M_1, g_1)$ and $(M_2, g_2)$ be two Riemannian manifolds. Their Riemannian product is the manifold $M = M_1 \\times M_2$ with the metric $g = g_1 \\oplus g_2$. Let us use local coordinates $(x^i)$ for a chart on $M_1$ and $(y^a)$ for a chart on $M_2$. Then $(x^i, y^a)$ form local coordinates for a chart on $M$. The metric tensor $g$ on $M$ has components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ which form a block-diagonal matrix:\n    $$\n    (g_{\\mu\\nu}) = \\begin{pmatrix} (g_{1, ij}(x)) & 0 \\\\ 0 & (g_{2, ab}(y)) \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    where $g_{1, ij}$ are the components of $g_1$ depending only on the $x^i$ coordinates, and $g_{2, ab}$ are the components of $g_2$ depending only on the $y^a$ coordinates. The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}$ of the Levi-Civita connection are given by the Koszul formula. Due to the block-diagonal structure of the metric and its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$, and the separate dependence of the blocks on their respective coordinates, the Christoffel symbols are zero unless all three indices belong to the same coordinate group. That is, the only potentially non-zero symbols are $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ (computed from $g_1$) and $\\Gamma^c_{ab}$ (computed from $g_2$). All mixed-index Christoffel symbols, such as $\\Gamma^k_{ab}$, $\\Gamma^a_{ij}$, $\\Gamma^i_{ja}$, etc., are identically zero.\n\n    The subbundle $E_1$ is the distribution of vectors tangent to the first $S^2$ factor, and $E_2$ is the distribution tangent to the second. A local basis for $E_1$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\}$ and for $E_2$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}\\}$. To show $E_1$ is parallel, we must show that for any vector field $X \\in \\mathfrak{X}(M)$ and any section $Y \\in \\Gamma(E_1)$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X Y$ is also a section of $E_1$. Let $Y=Y^j(x,y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. We calculate its covariant derivative along a basis vector field, say $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}$:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} Y = \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\left(Y^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial Y^j}{\\partial y^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} + Y^j \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\n    $$\n    Using the definition of Christoffel symbols, $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = \\Gamma^k_{aj} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} + \\Gamma^c_{aj} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^c}$. Since the mixed symbols $\\Gamma^k_{aj}$ and $\\Gamma^c_{aj}$ are zero, we have $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = 0$. Thus, $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} Y = \\frac{\\partial Y^j}{\\partial y^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$, which is a section of $E_1$. A similar calculation for $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}} Y$ also results in a section of $E_1$. Since any vector field $X$ is a linear combination of these basis fields, it follows by linearity that $\\nabla_X Y \\in \\Gamma(E_1)$. Therefore, $E_1$ is a parallel subbundle. An identical argument holds for $E_2$.\n\n2.  Next, we analyze the manifold in the context of the de Rham decomposition theorem.\n    The $2$-sphere $S^2$ with its standard round metric is a compact Riemannian manifold. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a compact Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete. The Riemannian product of two complete manifolds is itself complete. Thus, $M = S^2 \\times S^2$, being the product of two complete manifolds, is complete.\n    The fundamental group of a product space is the product of the fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(X \\times Y) \\cong \\pi_1(X) \\times \\pi_1(Y)$. For the sphere $S^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, the fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^n)=\\{e\\}$. Thus, $\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^2 \\times S^2) \\cong \\pi_1(S^2) \\times \\pi_1(S^2) \\cong \\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$, which is the trivial group. This establishes that $M$ is simply connected.\n\n    The de Rham decomposition theorem states that any complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ splits uniquely (up to isometry and reordering) as a Riemannian product $(M,g) \\cong (\\mathbb{R}^k, g_{Euc}) \\times (M_1, g_1) \\times \\dots \\times (M_r, g_r)$, where $(\\mathbb{R}^k, g_{Euc})$ is a Euclidean factor and each $(M_i, g_i)$ is an irreducible, complete, and simply connected Riemannian manifold. A manifold is irreducible if its holonomy group acts irreducibly on its tangent space.\n    The parallel splitting $TM = E_1 \\oplus E_2$ implies that the holonomy group of $M$ is reducible, as any parallel transported vector initially in $E_1$ (or $E_2$) remains in $E_1$ (or $E_2$). Therefore, $(M,g)$ is a reducible manifold. The de Rham theorem guarantees that this corresponds to a product decomposition. The factors correspond to the integral manifolds of the parallel distributions $E_1$ and $E_2$, which are precisely the two $S^2$ factors. The decomposition is $(M,g) \\cong (S^2, g_{S^2}) \\times (S^2, g_{S^2})$.\n    To confirm this is the final decomposition into irreducible factors, we must check that $(S^2, g_{S^2})$ is irreducible. The holonomy group of the standard $n$-sphere ($n \\ge 2$) at any point $p$ is $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^n) = \\mathrm{SO}(n)$. For $S^2$, this is $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^2) = \\mathrm{SO}(2)$. The group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ acts on the tangent space $T_p S^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ by rotations. This action is irreducible because there is no non-trivial proper subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is invariant under all rotations. Thus, $(S^2, g_{S^2})$ is an irreducible Riemannian manifold. The de Rham decomposition of $(M,g)$ is therefore into the two irreducible factors: $(S^2, g_{S^2}) \\times (S^2, g_{S^2})$.\n\n3.  Finally, we determine the restricted holonomy group at $o=(p,q) \\in M$. As $M$ is simply connected, the restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o^0(M)$ is the same as the full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M)$. For a Riemannian product $M_1 \\times M_2$, the holonomy group at a point $(p_1, p_2)$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the holonomy groups of the factors: $\\mathrm{Hol}_{(p_1,p_2)}(M_1 \\times M_2) \\cong \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2)$.\n    Applying this to our case, $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M) \\cong \\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^2) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_q(S^2)$. Since $\\mathrm{Hol}(S^2) = \\mathrm{SO}(2)$, we have $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M) \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2) \\times \\mathrm{SO}(2)$.\n    This group acts on the tangent space $T_oM = T_pS^2 \\oplus T_qS^2$. The action is reducible, with $T_pS^2$ and $T_qS^2$ being invariant subspaces. Let us choose an orthonormal basis for $T_oM$ adapted to this splitting. Let $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_pS^2$ and $\\{e_3, e_4\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_qS^2$. Then $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_oM$.\n    A general element of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ can be represented by a rotation matrix $R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    A typical element of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M)$ corresponds to a pair of rotations, one acting on $T_pS^2$ with angle $\\theta_1$ and another acting on $T_qS^2$ with angle $\\theta_2$.

At $(t_{0}, p)$, these fields are $U|_{(t_0,p)} = u$ and $\\tilde{V}|_{(t_0,p)} = \\tilde{v}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Lie bracket $[U, \\tilde{V}]$:\n$$[U, \\tilde{V}] = \\Big[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\frac{1}{\\cosh(t)}V\\Big] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\cosh(t)}\\Big)V = -\\frac{\\sinh(t)}{\\cosh^{2}(t)}V$$\nSince $V=\\cosh(t)\\tilde{V}$, we have:\n$$[U, \\tilde{V}] = -\\frac{\\sinh(t)}{\\cosh^{2}(t)}(\\cosh(t)\\tilde{V}) = -\\frac{\\sinh(t)}{\\cosh(t)}\\tilde{V} = -\\tanh(t)\\tilde{V}$$\nNext, we calculate the necessary covariant derivatives.

A direct consequence is that the sectional curvature of any $2$-plane spanned by a vector $X \\in V_1$ and a vector $Y \\in V_2$ must be zero.\nIn our case, the manifold is $M=\\mathbb{R} \\times S^2$, and the vectors $u$ and $\\tilde{v}$ are tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ and $S^2$ factors, respectively. The plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{u, \\tilde{v}\\}$ is a mixed-tangent plane. We have computed its sectional curvature to be $K(\\sigma) = -1$.\nSince the mixed sectional curvature is non-zero, the holonomy group does not decompose, and the metric $g$ does not admit a local Riemannian product structure.
