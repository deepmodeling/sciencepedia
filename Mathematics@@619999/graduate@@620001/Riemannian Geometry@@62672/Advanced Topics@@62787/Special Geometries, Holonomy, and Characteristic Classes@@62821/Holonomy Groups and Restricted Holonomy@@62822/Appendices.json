The solution will be derived starting from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the value of $\\det(P_{\\gamma})$.\nThe parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}: T_p S^2 \\to T_p S^2$ is a linear transformation on the tangent space at point $p$. One of the provided core facts states that parallel transport by the Levi-Civita connection preserves the Riemannian metric. This means that for any two tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_p S^2$, the inner product is preserved: $\\langle P_{\\gamma}(u), P_{\\gamma}(v) \\rangle_p = \\langle u, v \\rangle_p$. This defines $P_{\\gamma}$ as an element of the orthogonal group of the tangent space $T_p S^2$. Since $T_p S^2$ is a $2$-dimensional real vector space equipped with an inner product, this group is isomorphic to the orthogonal group $O(2)$.\n\nThe problem also specifies that $S^2$ is equipped with a chosen orientation. A crucial provided fact is that on an oriented surface, the orthonormal frame bundle reduces to a principal Special Orthogonal group ($SO$) bundle. The Levi-Civita connection is a connection on this bundle. The implication is that parallel transport of an oriented orthonormal frame along any path results in another oriented orthonormal frame. The loop $\\gamma$ is closed, so $P_{\\gamma}$ maps an oriented frame at $p$ to another oriented frame at $p$. This means that the linear map $P_{\\gamma}$ must be orientation-preserving.\n\nThe group $O(2)$ consists of all $2 \\times 2$ orthogonal matrices. These are rotations and reflections. The orientation-preserving elements of $O(2)$ form the special orthogonal group $SO(2)$. An element of $O(2)$ is in $SO(2)$ if and only if its determinant is $+1$. Since $P_{\\gamma}$ must be orientation-preserving, it must be an element of $SO(2)$. By the definition of the special orthogonal group, the determinant of any of its elements is $1$.\nTherefore, we conclude that $\\det(P_{\\gamma}) = 1$.\n\nNext, we argue why $P_{\\gamma}$ is a nontrivial rotation whenever the area of $\\Delta$ is not an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.\nThe holonomy of a connection is intimately related to its curvature. For a connection on a principal bundle, the parallel transport map around a small closed loop is approximated by the exponential of the integral of the curvature $2$-form over the surface enclosed by the loop. For a finite loop $\\gamma = \\partial\\Delta$, this relationship is exact: $P_{\\gamma}$ is the matrix exponential of the integral of the Lie-algebra-valued curvature $2$-form $\\Omega$ over the region $\\Delta$.\n$$P_{\\gamma} = \\exp\\left(\\int_{\\Delta} \\Omega\\right)$$\nThe problem provides that the curvature $2$-form on an oriented surface is $\\Omega = K \\, dA$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature and $dA$ is the area form. For the unit $2$-sphere $S^2$, the Gaussian curvature is constant, $K=1$. In the language of Lie-algebra-valued forms, for the $SO(2)$ bundle, the curvature form $\\Omega$ acts on the tangent space and can be represented in any oriented orthonormal basis by the matrix-valued $2$-form:\n$$\\Omega = K \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} dA$$\nSince $K=1$ for $S^2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} dA$$\nWe now compute the integral over the geodesic triangle $\\Delta$. Let $A_{\\Delta} = \\int_{\\Delta} dA$ be the spherical area of the triangle. The integral of the curvature form is:\n$$\\int_{\\Delta} \\Omega = \\int_{\\Delta} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} dA = \\left(\\int_{\\Delta} dA\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = A_{\\Delta} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nLet us denote the matrix $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is the standard generator of rotations in $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$, the Lie algebra of $SO(2)$. The parallel transport map is then:\n$$P_{\\gamma} = \\exp(A_{\\Delta} J)$$\nTo compute the matrix exponential, we use its Taylor series expansion. We note the property $J^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\\begin{align*} \\exp(A_{\\Delta} J) &= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(A_{\\Delta} J)^n}{n!} \\\\ &= I + A_{\\Delta} J + \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^2 J^2}{2!} + \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^3 J^3}{3!} + \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^4 J^4}{4!} + \\dots \\\\ &= I + A_{\\Delta} J - \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^2}{2!}I - \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^3}{3!}J + \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^4}{4!}I + \\dots \\\\ &= \\left(1 - \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^2}{2!} + \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^4}{4!} - \\dots\\right)I + \\left(A_{\\Delta} - \\frac{A_{\\Delta}^3}{3!} + \\dots\\right)J\\end{align*}\nThe series in the parentheses are the Taylor series for $\\cos(A_{\\Delta})$ and $\\sin(A_{\\Delta})$, respectively. Thus, we arrive at the matrix representation of $P_{\\gamma}$:\n$$P_{\\gamma} = \\cos(A_{\\Delta}) I + \\sin(A_{\\Delta}) J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(A_{\\Delta}) & -\\sin(A_{\\Delta}) \\\\ \\sin(A_{\\Delta}) & \\cos(A_{\\Delta}) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is the matrix of a rotation in the plane $T_p S^2$ by an angle equal to $\\theta = A_{\\Delta}$, the area of the geodesic triangle. This result is a manifestation of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, relating curvature (and thus area on $S^2$) to geometry (the holonomy angle).\n\nA rotation is considered \"trivial\" if it is the identity transformation. The matrix for $P_{\\gamma}$ is the identity matrix $I$ if and only if:\n$$\\cos(A_{\\Delta}) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin(A_{\\Delta}) = 0$$\nThis pair of conditions is satisfied precisely when the angle of rotation $A_{\\Delta}$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. That is, $P_{\\gamma} = I$ if and only if $A_{\\Delta} = 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, if the spherical area of the triangle $\\Delta$ is not an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, then $A_{\\Delta} \\neq 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. In this case, $P_{\\gamma}$ is not the identity matrix. Since we have established that $P_{\\gamma}$ is a rotation in $SO(2)$, it must be a nontrivial rotation.\nThis completes the argument.\nThe problem requests the value of $\\det(P_{\\gamma})$ as the final answer. As derived, $P_{\\gamma}$ is an element of $SO(2)$, so its determinant must be $1$.\n$$\\det(P_{\\gamma}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(A_{\\Delta}) & -\\sin(A_{\\Delta}) \\\\ \\sin(A_{\\Delta}) & \\cos(A_{\\Delta}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos^2(A_{\\Delta}) - (-\\sin^2(A_{\\Delta})) = \\cos^2(A_{\\Delta}) + \\sin^2(A_{\\Delta}) = 1$$\nThis confirms our initial deduction based on the properties of $SO(2)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2979271"}, {"introduction": "Having built intuition on the 2-sphere, we now generalize to the n-dimensional sphere, a quintessential example of a symmetric space of constant curvature.

We begin by deriving the curvature tensor of the unit sphere, then we relate it to the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$, and finally, we use the Ambroseâ€“Singer theorem to determine the restricted holonomy Lie algebra.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Curvature Endomorphism\n\nLet $(S^n, g)$ be the $n$-dimensional unit sphere embedded as a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, with $n \\geq 2$. The metric $g$ is induced from the standard Euclidean inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $p \\in S^n$ be a point, and let $u,v,w,z \\in T_p S^n$ be tangent vectors at $p$. Let $X,Y,Z,W$ be local vector field extensions of these vectors. The Gauss equation relates the curvature tensor $R$ of $S^n$ to the curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and the shape operator $S$ of the hypersurface. For the flat ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ ($\\bar{R} \\equiv 0$), the Gauss equation that aligns with the problem's curvature convention and the expected result for a sphere (constant positive curvature) is:\n$$\n\\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle = \\langle S(Y), Z \\rangle \\langle S(X), W \\rangle - \\langle S(X), Z \\rangle \\langle S(Y), W \\rangle\n$$\nFor the unit sphere $S^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the shape operator $S$ is either the identity ($\\mathrm{Id}$) or its negative, depending on the choice of unit normal field. Let's say $S = \\epsilon \\, \\mathrm{Id}$ with $\\epsilon^2 = 1$. Substituting this into the Gauss equation gives:\n$$\n\\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle = \\epsilon^2 (\\langle Y, Z \\rangle \\langle X, W \\rangle - \\langle X, Z \\rangle \\langle Y, W \\rangle)\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon^2 = 1$, we can evaluate this at point $p$ for tangent vectors $u,v,w,z$:\n$$\n\\langle R_p(u,v)w, z \\rangle = \\langle v, w \\rangle \\langle u, z \\rangle - \\langle u, w \\rangle \\langle v, z \\rangle\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\langle (\\langle v,w \\rangle u - \\langle u,w \\rangle v), z \\rangle$. Since this holds for any $z \\in T_p S^n$ and the inner product is non-degenerate, we can conclude:\n$$\nR_p(u,v)w = \\langle v, w \\rangle u - \\langle u, w \\rangle v\n$$\nThis is the required explicit formula for the curvature endomorphism $R_p(u,v): T_p S^n \\to T_p S^n$.\n\nPart 2: Isomorphism and Span of Curvature Endomorphisms\n\nWe are given the map $\\Phi \\colon \\Lambda^2 T_p S^n \\to \\mathfrak{so}(T_p S^n)$ defined by $\\Phi(u \\wedge v) = A_{u,v}$, where $A_{u,v}(w) = \\langle v,w \\rangle u - \\langle u,w \\rangle v$. From Part 1, we see that $A_{u,v}$ is precisely the curvature endomorphism $R_p(u,v)$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $A_{u,v}$ is an element of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_p S^n)$, the Lie algebra of skew-symmetric endomorphisms on $T_p S^n$. An endomorphism $A$ is skew-symmetric if $\\langle A(w), z \\rangle = - \\langle w, A(z) \\rangle$ for all $w, z \\in T_p S^n$.\n$$\n\\langle A_{u,v}(w), z \\rangle = \\langle \\langle v,w \\rangle u - \\langle u,w \\rangle v, z \\rangle = \\langle v,w \\rangle \\langle u,z \\rangle - \\langle u,w \\rangle \\langle v,z \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n- \\langle w, A_{u,v}(z) \\rangle = - \\langle w, \\langle v,z \\rangle u - \\langle u,z \\rangle v \\rangle = -(\\langle v,z \\rangle \\langle w,u \\rangle - \\langle u,z \\rangle \\langle w,v \\rangle) = \\langle u,z \\rangle \\langle v,w \\rangle - \\langle v,z \\rangle \\langle u,w \\rangle\n$$\nThe two expressions are identical, so $A_{u,v}$ is indeed a skew-symmetric endomorphism. The map $\\Phi$ is well-defined.\n\nNext, we show $\\Phi$ is a vector space isomorphism. The dimension of the tangent space $T_p S^n$ is $n$.\nThe dimension of the domain $\\Lambda^2 T_p S^n$ is $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 T_p S^n) = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nThe dimension of the codomain $\\mathfrak{so}(T_p S^n)$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$, is $\\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(n)) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nSince the domain and codomain have the same finite dimension, the linear map $\\Phi$ is an isomorphism if and only if it is injective.\n\nTo prove injectivity, we show that the kernel of $\\Phi$ is trivial. Let $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_p S^n$. An arbitrary element $\\alpha \\in \\Lambda^2 T_p S^n$ can be written as $\\alpha = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} c_{ij} e_i \\wedge e_j$ for some coefficients $c_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSuppose $\\Phi(\\alpha) = 0$. By linearity, this means $\\sum_{i<j} c_{ij} \\Phi(e_i \\wedge e_j) = 0$. This is the zero endomorphism. Let's apply it to a basis vector $e_k$:\n$$\n\\left( \\sum_{i<j} c_{ij} A_{e_i, e_j} \\right) (e_k) = \\sum_{i<j} c_{ij} (\\langle e_j, e_k \\rangle e_i - \\langle e_i, e_k \\rangle e_j) = 0\n$$\nUsing the orthonormality condition $\\langle e_a, e_b \\rangle = \\delta_{ab}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i<j} c_{ij} (\\delta_{jk} e_i - \\delta_{ik} e_j) = 0\n$$\nFor a fixed $k$, the terms in the sum are non-zero only if $j=k$ or $i=k$.\nThe sum becomes: $\\sum_{i<k} c_{ik} e_i - \\sum_{j>k} c_{kj} e_j = 0$.\nThe vectors $\\{e_l\\}_{l\\neq k}$ are linearly independent. Thus, all coefficients in this linear combination must be zero. This implies $c_{ik} = 0$ for all $i < k$ and $c_{kj} = 0$ for all $j > k$. Since this holds for any choice of $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, it follows that all coefficients $c_{ij}$ are zero. Thus $\\alpha=0$, and $\\Phi$ is injective.\nSince $\\Phi$ is an injective linear map between vector spaces of the same finite dimension, it is an isomorphism.\n\nThe linear span of the curvature endomorphisms is the set $\\mathrm{span}\\{R_p(u,v) : u,v \\in T_pS^n\\} = \\mathrm{span}\\{A_{u,v} : u,v \\in T_pS^n\\}$. This is precisely the image of the linear map $\\Phi$. Since $\\Phi$ is an isomorphism, it is surjective, so its image is the entire codomain. Therefore, the linear span of the curvature endomorphisms is all of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_pS^n)$.\n\nPart 3: The Restricted Holonomy Lie Algebra\n\nThe Ambroseâ€“Singer Holonomy Theorem states that if $(M,g)$ is a simply connected, complete, and connected Riemannian manifold, then its restricted holonomy Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ at a point $p \\in M$ is the Lie algebra generated by the set of all curvature endomorphisms $\\{R_p(u,v) : u,v \\in T_pM\\}$.\n\nThe manifold in question is the unit sphere $(S^n,g)$ with $n \\geq 2$.\n1. For $n \\geq 2$, the sphere $S^n$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(S^n)=0$).\n2. As a compact Riemannian manifold, $S^n$ is complete.\n3. $S^n$ is connected.\nAll conditions of the Ambroseâ€“Singer theorem are met.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ is the Lie algebra generated by the set of endomorphisms $\\{R_p(u,v) : u,v \\in T_pS^n\\}$.\nFrom Part 2, we established that the linear span of this set is the entire Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(T_pS^n)$.\nLet $\\mathcal{R}_p = \\{R_p(u,v) : u,v \\in T_pS^n\\}$. We have $\\mathrm{span}(\\mathcal{R}_p) = \\mathfrak{so}(T_pS^n)$.\nThe Lie algebra generated by $\\mathcal{R}_p$, denoted $\\mathrm{Lie}(\\mathcal{R}_p)$, is the smallest Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{gl}(T_pS^n)$ containing $\\mathcal{R}_p$. This is equivalent to the smallest Lie algebra containing $\\mathrm{span}(\\mathcal{R}_p)$.\nSince $\\mathrm{span}(\\mathcal{R}_p) = \\mathfrak{so}(T_pS^n)$ is itself a Lie algebra (it is closed under the commutator bracket of endomorphisms), the smallest Lie algebra containing it is $\\mathfrak{so}(T_pS^n)$ itself.\nThus, we conclude that the restricted holonomy Lie algebra at $p$ is:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{hol}_p = \\mathfrak{so}(T_pS^n)\n$$\nIdentifying the $n$-dimensional tangent space $T_pS^n$ with $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this Lie algebra is isomorphic to the standard special orthogonal Lie algebra in dimension $n$.

The translational part $t+v$ has a $z$-component of $v_z+\\tfrac{1}{3}$. Since $v_3=(0,0,1)$ is a generator of $L$, any $v \\in L$ has an integer $z$-component. Thus $v_z+\\tfrac{1}{3} \\neq 0$. Therefore, $t+v \\notin \\mathrm{Im}(I-A)$, so no element with linear part $A$ has a fixed point.\nFor $B=A^2$, an element is of the form $T_v \\circ g^2$.\n$$g^2(x) = A(Ax+t)+t = A^2x + At+t$$\nSo $\\gamma(x) = A^2x + At+t + v$. The matrix $I-A^2$ also has the $\\{x,y\\}$-plane as its image. The translational part has $z$-component $(At)_z+t_z+v_z = t_z+t_z+v_z = \\tfrac{1}{3}+\\tfrac{1}{3}+v_z = \\tfrac{2}{3}+v_z \\neq 0$. So this translational part is not in $\\mathrm{Im}(I-A^2)$.\nThus, the action of $\\Gamma$ is free. For crystallographic groups, a free action is also properly discontinuous.\n\nThe quotient space $M=\\mathbb{R}^3/\\Gamma$ is a manifold because the action is free and properly discontinuous. The fundamental domain of the lattice $L$ is compact. $M$ can be seen as the quotient of the compact torus $\\mathbb{R}^3/L$ by the finite group $\\Gamma/L \\cong \\{I, A, A^2\\}$, hence $M$ is compact. Since the metric on $M$ is induced from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ via isometries (the elements of $\\Gamma$), the curvature of $M$ is identically zero, so $M$ is a flat manifold.\n\nNow we determine the holonomy groups. For a flat manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^n/\\Gamma$, the holonomy group is given by the group of linear parts of the isometries in $\\Gamma$. This is known as the point group of $\\Gamma$. The holonomy transformation corresponding to a loop $\\alpha$ at a point $p \\in M$ is obtained by lifting $\\alpha$ to a path $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ connects $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\gamma(\\tilde{p})$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, the holonomy transformation is the linear part of $\\gamma$.\n\nThe restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}^0(M)$ is the connected component of the identity of the full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$. It is generated by parallel transport along null-homotopic loops. For any flat manifold, the curvature tensor is zero. By the Ambrose-Singer theorem, the Lie algebra of the holonomy group is generated by the curvature operators. Since the curvature is zero ($R=0$), the Lie algebra is trivial, which implies that $\\mathrm{Hol}^0(M)$ is the trivial group, containing only the identity transformation.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}^{0}(M) = \\{I\\}\n$$\nThe full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$ is the point group of $\\Gamma$. The elements of $\\Gamma$ are generated by translations $T_v$ (linear part $I$) and the glide rotation $g$ (linear part $A$). Any composition of these will have a linear part that is a power of $A$. Specifically, the group of linear parts is the group generated by $A$. Since $A$ is a rotation by $2\\pi/3$, we have $A^3=I$. Therefore, the holonomy group is a cyclic group of order $3$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}(M) = \\{I, A, A^2\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3\n$$\nThis is a finite, discrete group, consistent with $\\mathrm{Hol}^0(M)$ being trivial.\n\nThe problem asks for a single matrix that generates $\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$. This is the matrix $A$. We write it in its explicit numerical form:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) & -\\sin\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) & \\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\tfrac{1}{2} & -\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\\\ \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\tfrac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is the generator of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2979283"}]}
