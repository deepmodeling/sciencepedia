Let $(M,g)$ represent either the $n$-sphere $(S^n, g_{S^n})$ with constant positive sectional curvature or the $n$-dimensional real hyperbolic space $(\\mathbb{H}^n, g_{\\mathbb{H}^n})$ with constant negative sectional curvature. In both cases, $M$ is an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant, non-zero sectional curvature $\\kappa$, and for $n \\geq 2$, it is simply connected and oriented.\n\nOur goal is to determine the Lie group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ for an arbitrary point $p \\in M$. The strategy is to first determine its Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$, and then deduce the structure of the group itself.\n\nAccording to the Ambrose–Singer theorem, a provided fact, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$ is generated by the set of curvature endomorphisms. As $S^n$ and $\\mathbb{H}^n$ are homogeneous spaces (specifically, symmetric spaces), the algebraic structure of the curvature tensor is the same at every point. Therefore, the set of generators for $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$ can be simplified to the set of endomorphisms $\\{ R(X,Y) : T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M \\mid X,Y \\in T_{p}M \\}$, without needing to consider parallel transport from other points.\n\nThe given form of the curvature tensor for a manifold of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa \\neq 0$ is:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\big( \\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y \\big)\n$$\nwhere $X, Y, Z$ are tangent vectors in $T_{p}M$.\n\nTo analyze the Lie algebra generated by these endomorphisms, let us choose an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_n\\}$ for the tangent space $T_{p}M$. With respect to this basis, $T_{p}M$ can be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ becomes the standard dot product. An endomorphism is then represented by an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be vectors in $T_pM$, represented as column vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The action of the endomorphism $R(X,Y)$ on a vector $Z$ is:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\big( (Y^T Z) X - (X^T Z) Y \\big)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten using matrix multiplication as:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\big( X(Y^T Z) - Y(X^T Z) \\big) = \\kappa \\big( (XY^T)Z - (YX^T)Z \\big) = \\kappa (XY^T - YX^T)Z\n$$\nThus, the matrix representing the curvature endomorphism $R(X,Y)$ is $\\kappa (XY^T - YX^T)$. The matrix $XY^T - YX^T$ is skew-symmetric, since $(XY^T - YX^T)^T = (Y^T)^T X^T - (X^T)^T Y^T = YX^T - XY^T = -(XY^T - YX^T)$.\n\nThe set of all $n \\times n$ real skew-symmetric matrices is the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ of the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$. To determine $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M)$, we need to find the Lie algebra generated by all matrices of the form $\\kappa(XY^T - YX^T)$ for all $X,Y \\in T_{p}M$. Since $\\kappa \\neq 0$, this is the same as the algebra generated by matrices of the form $XY^T - YX^T$.\n\nLet us show that these generators span the entire space $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$. A standard basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is given by the set of matrices $\\{E_{ij} - E_{ji} \\mid 1 \\leq i < j \\leq n\\}$, where $E_{ij}$ is the matrix with a $1$ in the $(i,j)$ position and zeros elsewhere.\nLet us choose $X=e_i$ and $Y=e_j$ from our orthonormal basis. The corresponding curvature operator matrix (ignoring the factor $\\kappa$) is:\n$$\ne_i e_j^T - e_j e_i^T = E_{ij} - E_{ji}\n$$\nBy choosing all possible pairs of distinct basis vectors $e_i, e_j$, we can construct all the basis elements of $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$. Therefore, the set of curvature endomorphisms $\\{ R(X,Y) \\mid X,Y \\in T_pM \\}$ generates the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$.\nThus, by the Ambrose–Singer theorem, we have:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M) = \\mathfrak{so}(n)\n$$\nThis result holds for both $M=S^n$ and $M=\\mathbb{H}^n$.\n\nNow we must determine the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ from its Lie algebra. We are given that $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ is a subgroup of the orthogonal group $O(n)$. Let $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^0(M)$ be the connected component of the identity of $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$. $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^0(M)$ is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M) = \\mathfrak{so}(n)$.

The full holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)$ is obtained by considering all closed loops based at $p$. The relationship between the full and restricted holonomy groups is that $\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}(M)/\\operatorname{Hol}_{p}^0(M)$ is a quotient group isomorphic to a subgroup of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M,p)$.\n\nWe are given as a foundational fact that for $n \\geq 2$, both $S^n$ and $\\mathbb{H}^n$ are simply connected.

The fact that these manifolds are oriented is consistent with this conclusion, since orientability of a manifold implies its holonomy group is a subgroup of $SO(n)$.

We will proceed by first constraining the holonomy group using the Kähler property of the space, then fully determining it using the properties of symmetric spaces, and finally calculating its dimension.\n\nLet $(M, g)$ be the Riemannian manifold $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ with the Fubini-Study metric $g$. Let $p \\in M$ be a point. The holonomy group at $p$, denoted $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$, is a subgroup of the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(T_{p}M, g_p)$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{O}(2n)$ since the real dimension of $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ is $2n$.\n\nFirst, we use the fact that $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ with the Fubini-Study metric is a Kähler manifold. By definition, this means there exists a complex structure $J: T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$ with $J^{2} = -I$ which is compatible with the metric (i.e., $g(JX, JY)=g(X, Y)$ for all $X, Y \\in T_{p}M$) and is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$, i.e., $\\nabla J = 0$.\n\nThe condition $\\nabla J = 0$ implies that parallel transport commutes with $J$. Specifically, for any piecewise smooth loop $\\gamma$ based at $p$, the parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}: T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$ satisfies $P_{\\gamma} \\circ J = J \\circ P_{\\gamma}$. Since the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is generated by all such maps $P_{\\gamma}$, every element $h \\in \\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ must commute with $J$.\n\nAn element of $\\mathrm{O}(2n)$ that commutes with the complex structure $J$ is, by definition, a unitary transformation. The group of such transformations on the tangent space $T_{p}M \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is the unitary group $\\mathrm{U}(n)$. Therefore, the holonomy group must be a subgroup of $\\mathrm{U}(n)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(n)\n$$\n\nNext, we use the information that $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ is an irreducible Riemannian symmetric space. For a simply connected symmetric space represented as a quotient $M = G/K$, where $G$ is the connected component of the identity of the isometry group and $K$ is the isotropy subgroup at a point $p$, a fundamental theorem states that the connected component of the holonomy group, $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}^{0}(g)$, coincides with the image of the connected component of the isotropy group $K_0$ under the isotropy representation. Since $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ for $n \\ge 1$ is simply connected, its holonomy group is connected, so $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(g) = \\mathrm{Hol}_p^0(g)$.\n\nThe problem provides that the isometry group is $G = \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$ and the isotropy group at a point is $K = S(\\mathrm{U}(n)\\mathrm{U}(1))$. The group $K$ is connected. Thus, $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is the image of the isotropy representation $\\rho: K \\to \\mathrm{GL}(T_pM)$.\n\nLet us identify the structure of $K$ and its action on $T_pM$. Let the point $p$ be represented by the homogeneous coordinates $[1:0:\\dots:0]$ in $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$. The isotropy group $K$ at $p$ is the subgroup of $G = \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$ that fixes the complex line $\\mathbb{C} \\cdot (1,0,\\dots,0)^T$. An element $k \\in \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$ that fixes this line must be of the block-diagonal form:\n$$\nk = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $k$ to be in $\\mathrm{U}(n+1)$, we must have $a \\in \\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $B \\in \\mathrm{U}(n)$. The condition that $k \\in \\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$ imposes $\\det(k) = 1$, which means $a \\det(B) = 1$. This is precisely the definition of the group $K = S(\\mathrm{U}(n)\\times\\mathrm{U}(1))$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_{p}(\\mathbb{C}P^{n})$ can be identified with the orthogonal complement of the line $\\mathbb{C} \\cdot (1,0,\\dots,0)^T$ in $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, which is the space spanned by the standard basis vectors $\\{e_2, \\dots, e_{n+1}\\}$. This space is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. A tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}M$ can be written as $v = (0, w)^T$, where $w \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\n\nThe isotropy representation $\\rho$ describes the action of $K$ on $T_pM$. For $k \\in K$ and $v \\in T_pM$ as above, the action is given by matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\rho(k)v = k v = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & B \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ w \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ Bw \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIdentifying $T_{p}M$ with $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ via the map $(0, w)^T \\mapsto w$, the action of $k$ on $w$ is simply $w \\mapsto Bw$. The holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is the group of all such linear transformations on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. We must determine the set of all matrices $B$ that can appear.\n\nAn element $B \\in \\mathrm{U}(n)$ appears as the lower-right block of some $k \\in K$ if and only if there exists an $a \\in \\mathrm{U}(1)$ such that $a \\det(B) = 1$. For any given $B \\in \\mathrm{U}(n)$, its determinant $\\det(B)$ is a complex number of modulus $1$, i.e., $\\det(B) \\in \\mathrm{U}(1)$. We can always choose $a = (\\det(B))^{-1}$, which is also in $\\mathrm{U}(1)$. With this choice, the matrix $k = \\mathrm{diag}(a, B)$ is an element of $K$. This means that for any $B \\in \\mathrm{U}(n)$, there is a corresponding element in $K$. Therefore, the image of the isotropy representation is the entire unitary group $\\mathrm{U}(n)$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) = \\mathrm{U}(n)\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the initial constraint $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(n)$. The irreducibility of $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ implies that the holonomy group must act irreducibly on $T_p M$, and $\\mathrm{U}(n)$ is indeed a maximal subgroup of $\\mathrm{SO}(2n)$ with an irreducible action on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^n$ (for $n>1$; for $n=1$, $\\mathrm{U}(1) \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is irreducible), confirming our finding.\n\nFinally, we compute the real dimension of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g) = \\mathrm{U}(n)$. The dimension of a Lie group is the dimension of its Lie algebra. The Lie algebra of $\\mathrm{U}(n)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{u}(n)$, consists of all $n \\times n$ complex matrices $A$ that are skew-hermitian, i.e., $A^{\\dagger} = -A$.\n\nLet an arbitrary matrix $A \\in \\mathfrak{u}(n)$ be written as $A = X + iY$, where $X$ and $Y$ are $n \\times n$ real matrices. The condition $A^{\\dagger}=-A$ becomes:\n$$\n(X + iY)^{\\dagger} = X^T - iY^T = -(X+iY) = -X - iY\n$$\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get two conditions on the real matrices $X$ and $Y$:\n1. $X^T = -X$: $X$ must be a skew-symmetric matrix.\n2. $Y^T = Y$: $Y$ must be a symmetric matrix.\n\nThe real dimension of the space of $n \\times n$ real skew-symmetric matrices is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nThe real dimension of the space of $n \\times n$ real symmetric matrices is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\nThe dimension of $\\mathfrak{u}(n)$ is the sum of these dimensions:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathrm{U}(n)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathfrak{u}(n)) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n^{2} - n + n^{2} + n}{2} = \\frac{2n^{2}}{2} = n^{2}\n$$\nThus, the real dimension of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(g)$ is $n^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2968941"}, {"introduction": "The existence of special holonomy groups like $SU(n)$ is a deep consequence of the Berger classification, famously linked to Ricci-flatness by Yau's theorem.

This is a complex torus of complex dimension $n$, which has a real dimension of $2n$. The manifold $X$ is obtained as a quotient of $\\mathbb{C}^{n} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ by a full lattice $\\Lambda$. The projection map $\\pi: \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\to X$ is the universal covering map. The metric $g$ on $X$ is induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, which we can write in standard coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^{2n})$ as $ds^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{2n} (dx^i)^2$. In these coordinates, the metric tensor components are constant: $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ associated with the metric $g$ is characterized by the Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$, which are computed using the formula:\n$$ \\Gamma_{ij}^k = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right) $$\nSince the metric components $g_{ij}$ are constant in the Euclidean coordinates on the universal cover $\\mathbb{C}^n$, all their partial derivatives are zero. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are identically zero in this coordinate system.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is determined by the Christoffel symbols. Its components in a coordinate basis are given by:\n$$ R^i_{jkl} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^i_{jl}}{\\partial x^k} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^i_{jk}}{\\partial x^l} + \\sum_{m=1}^{2n} \\left( \\Gamma^m_{jl}\\Gamma^i_{mk} - \\Gamma^m_{jk}\\Gamma^i_{ml} \\right) $$\nSince all $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$, it immediately follows that the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero. This confirms that the metric $g$ is flat, meaning the manifold $(X, g)$ is locally isometric to Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\nNext, we compute the parallel transport operator. The equation for a vector field $V$ to be parallel along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)}V = 0$. In our chosen coordinates, this equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dV^k}{dt} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{2n} \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} V^j = 0 $$\nBecause $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$, the condition for parallel transport becomes simply $\\frac{dV^k}{dt} = 0$ for each component $k=1, \\dots, 2n$. This means that the components of a vector with respect to the standard constant orthonormal frame $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2n}}\\}$ on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ remain constant during parallel transport. On the universal cover $\\mathbb{C}^n$, parallel transport along any path is equivalent to the identity map on the vector components.\n\nNow, consider a loop $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to X$ based at a point $p \\in X$. Such a loop can be lifted to a path $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{C}^n$ in the universal cover. Let $\\tilde{p} \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ be a point such that $\\pi(\\tilde{p})=p$. We set $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = \\tilde{p}$. Since $\\gamma(1) = \\gamma(0) = p$, the endpoint of the lifted path, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)$, must lie in the fiber over $p$, which is the set of points $\\{\\tilde{p} + \\lambda \\mid \\lambda \\in \\Lambda\\}$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1) = \\tilde{p} + \\lambda_{\\gamma}$ for some unique lattice vector $\\lambda_{\\gamma} \\in \\Lambda$. The problem asks to consider a loop $\\gamma$ that is a generator of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X,p)$. The fundamental group is isomorphic to the lattice, $\\pi_1(X,p) \\cong \\Lambda$. So, such a loop corresponds to a path $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ connecting $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is a generator of the lattice $\\Lambda$.\n\nTo compute the parallel transport operator $P_{\\gamma}: T_p X \\to T_p X$, we take a vector $v \\in T_p X$. We lift it to a vector $\\tilde{v} \\in T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{C}^n$ via the inverse of the differential of the projection map, $(d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}})^{-1}$. We then parallel transport $\\tilde{v}$ along the lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ from $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$. As established, the components of the transported vector, $\\tilde{v}' \\in T_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda}\\mathbb{C}^n$, are identical to the components of $\\tilde{v}$ in the constant orthonormal frame. Finally, we project $\\tilde{v}'$ back down to $T_p X$ via the map $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda}$.\nThe tangent spaces $T_q \\mathbb{C}^n$ for any $q \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ are canonically identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, and the differentials $d\\pi_q$ provide isometries to $T_{\\pi(q)}X$. The constant orthonormal frame field on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ gives a basis for each tangent space. Since the components of the vector do not change during parallel transport on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, and the identifications of tangent spaces at $\\tilde{p}$ and $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$ with $T_pX$ are compatible, the resulting vector in $T_p X$ is identical to the original vector $v$.\nTherefore, the parallel transport operator $P_{\\gamma}$ is the identity map on $T_p X$. Expressed as a matrix with respect to any basis (including the specified constant global orthonormal frame), this is the $2n \\times 2n$ identity matrix, which we denote by $I_{2n}$.\n\nThe holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(g)$ is the group of all such parallel transport operators $P_{\\gamma}$ for all piecewise smooth loops $\\gamma$ based at $p$. Since the operators corresponding to the generators of $\\pi_1(X,p)$ are all the identity matrix, and any loop is homotopic to a composition of such generators, the parallel transport for any loop is also the identity. Thus, the holonomy group is the trivial group: $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(g) = \\{I_{2n}\\}$.\n\nFinally, we address why the holonomy is trivial and not $SU(n)$, despite $(X,g,J)$ being a compact Kähler manifold with first Chern class $c_1(X)=0$.\n1.  A key theorem, stemming from Yau's proof of the Calabi conjecture, states that a compact, *simply connected* Kähler manifold with $c_1=0$ admits a unique Ricci-flat Kähler metric, and its holonomy group is a subgroup of $SU(n)$ (specifically $SU(n)$ or $Sp(m)$ if irreducible). The complex torus $X$ is not simply connected; its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\Lambda \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. This is a crucial distinction.\n2.  For any Riemannian manifold, the holonomy algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}(g)$ (the Lie algebra of the *restricted* holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g)$) is generated by the curvature operators. Since our metric is flat, the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, $R=0$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{hol}(g) = \\{0\\}$, which implies that the restricted holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g)$ (from contractible loops) is the trivial group $\\{I_{2n}\\}$.\n3.  The general result for a compact Kähler manifold with $c_1=0$ is that its restricted holonomy group is a subgroup of $SU(n)$, i.e., $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g) \\subseteq SU(n)$. Our finding that $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g) = \\{I_{2n}\\}$ is perfectly consistent with this, as the trivial group is a subgroup of any group, including $SU(n)$.\n4.  The full holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}(g)$ can be larger than $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(g)$ on non-simply connected manifolds. However, as we calculated directly, the parallel transport around non-contractible loops is also trivial for this specific flat metric. Therefore, the full holonomy group is also trivial, $\\operatorname{Hol}(g)=\\{I_{2n}\\}$.\n5.  In the context of Berger's classification and the de Rham decomposition theorem, any compact Kähler manifold with $c_1=0$ splits isometrically into a product $T^k \\times M_1 \\times \\dots \\times M_r$, where $T^k$ is a flat torus and each $M_i$ is a simply connected manifold with holonomy $SU(n_i)$ or $Sp(m_i)$. The manifold in this problem, $X$, corresponds to the case where the product is just the torus factor. Manifolds with holonomy $SU(n)$ are Ricci-flat but are not flat ($R\\neq 0$). The flat torus is the unique case of a compact Ricci-flat Kähler manifold that is also flat, and its flatness forces the holonomy to be trivial.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{I_{2n}}\n$$", "id": "2968934"}]}
