This first exercise provides a foundational, hands-on look at the quintessential example of a reducible space: a Riemannian product.

Fix a base point $o = (p,q) \\in M$ and identify the tangent space $T_{o}M$ with $T_{p}S^{2} \\oplus T_{q}S^{2}$.

We will address the three parts of the problem in sequence.\n\n1.  We first demonstrate that the canonical splitting of the tangent bundle $T(S^2 \\times S^2) = E_1 \\oplus E_2$ is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$. Let $(M_1, g_1)$ and $(M_2, g_2)$ be two Riemannian manifolds. Their Riemannian product is the manifold $M = M_1 \\times M_2$ with the metric $g = g_1 \\oplus g_2$. Let us use local coordinates $(x^i)$ for a chart on $M_1$ and $(y^a)$ for a chart on $M_2$. Then $(x^i, y^a)$ form local coordinates for a chart on $M$. The metric tensor $g$ on $M$ has components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ which form a block-diagonal matrix:\n    $$\n    (g_{\\mu\\nu}) = \\begin{pmatrix} (g_{1, ij}(x)) & 0 \\\\ 0 & (g_{2, ab}(y)) \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    where $g_{1, ij}$ are the components of $g_1$ depending only on the $x^i$ coordinates, and $g_{2, ab}$ are the components of $g_2$ depending only on the $y^a$ coordinates. The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}$ of the Levi-Civita connection are given by the Koszul formula. Due to the block-diagonal structure of the metric and its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$, and the separate dependence of the blocks on their respective coordinates, the Christoffel symbols are zero unless all three indices belong to the same coordinate group. That is, the only potentially non-zero symbols are $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ (computed from $g_1$) and $\\Gamma^c_{ab}$ (computed from $g_2$). All mixed-index Christoffel symbols, such as $\\Gamma^k_{ab}$, $\\Gamma^a_{ij}$, $\\Gamma^i_{ja}$, etc., are identically zero.\n\n    The subbundle $E_1$ is the distribution of vectors tangent to the first $S^2$ factor, and $E_2$ is the distribution tangent to the second. A local basis for $E_1$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\}$ and for $E_2$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}\\}$. To show $E_1$ is parallel, we must show that for any vector field $X \\in \\mathfrak{X}(M)$ and any section $Y \\in \\Gamma(E_1)$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X Y$ is also a section of $E_1$. Let $Y=Y^j(x,y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. We calculate its covariant derivative along a basis vector field, say $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}$:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} Y = \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\left(Y^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial Y^j}{\\partial y^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} + Y^j \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\n    $$\n    Using the definition of Christoffel symbols, $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = \\Gamma^k_{aj} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} + \\Gamma^c_{aj} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^c}$. Since the mixed symbols $\\Gamma^k_{aj}$ and $\\Gamma^c_{aj}$ are zero, we have $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = 0$. Thus, $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}} Y = \\frac{\\partial Y^j}{\\partial y^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$, which is a section of $E_1$. A similar calculation for $\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}} Y$ also results in a section of $E_1$. Since any vector field $X$ is a linear combination of these basis fields, it follows by linearity that $\\nabla_X Y \\in \\Gamma(E_1)$. Therefore, $E_1$ is a parallel subbundle. An identical argument holds for $E_2$.\n\n2.  Next, we analyze the manifold in the context of the de Rham decomposition theorem.\n    The $2$-sphere $S^2$ with its standard round metric is a compact Riemannian manifold. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a compact Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete. The Riemannian product of two complete manifolds is itself complete. Thus, $M = S^2 \\times S^2$, being the product of two complete manifolds, is complete.\n    The fundamental group of a product space is the product of the fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(X \\times Y) \\cong \\pi_1(X) \\times \\pi_1(Y)$. For the sphere $S^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, the fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^n)=\\{e\\}$. Thus, $\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^2 \\times S^2) \\cong \\pi_1(S^2) \\times \\pi_1(S^2) \\cong \\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$, which is the trivial group. This establishes that $M$ is simply connected.\n\n    The de Rham decomposition theorem states that any complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ splits uniquely (up to isometry and reordering) as a Riemannian product $(M,g) \\cong (\\mathbb{R}^k, g_{Euc}) \\times (M_1, g_1) \\times \\dots \\times (M_r, g_r)$, where $(\\mathbb{R}^k, g_{Euc})$ is a Euclidean factor and each $(M_i, g_i)$ is an irreducible, complete, and simply connected Riemannian manifold. A manifold is irreducible if its holonomy group acts irreducibly on its tangent space.\n    The parallel splitting $TM = E_1 \\oplus E_2$ implies that the holonomy group of $M$ is reducible, as any parallel transported vector initially in $E_1$ (or $E_2$) remains in $E_1$ (or $E_2$). Therefore, $(M,g)$ is a reducible manifold. The de Rham theorem guarantees that this corresponds to a product decomposition. The factors correspond to the integral manifolds of the parallel distributions $E_1$ and $E_2$, which are precisely the two $S^2$ factors. The decomposition is $(M,g) \\cong (S^2, g_{S^2}) \\times (S^2, g_{S^2})$.\n    To confirm this is the final decomposition into irreducible factors, we must check that $(S^2, g_{S^2})$ is irreducible. The holonomy group of the standard $n$-sphere ($n \\ge 2$) at any point $p$ is $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^n) = \\mathrm{SO}(n)$. For $S^2$, this is $\\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^2) = \\mathrm{SO}(2)$. The group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ acts on the tangent space $T_p S^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ by rotations. This action is irreducible because there is no non-trivial proper subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is an invariant under all rotations. Thus, $(S^2, g_{S^2})$ is an irreducible Riemannian manifold. The de Rham decomposition of $(M,g)$ is therefore into the two irreducible factors: $(S^2, g_{S^2}) \\times (S^2, g_{S^2})$.\n\n3.  Finally, we determine the restricted holonomy group at $o=(p,q) \\in M$. As $M$ is simply connected, the restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o^0(M)$ is the same as the full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M)$. For a Riemannian product $M_1 \\times M_2$, the holonomy group at a point $(p_1, p_2)$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the holonomy groups of the factors: $\\mathrm{Hol}_{(p_1,p_2)}(M_1 \\times M_2) \\cong \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_1}(M_1) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_{p_2}(M_2)$.\n    Applying this to our case, $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M) \\cong \\mathrm{Hol}_p(S^2) \\times \\mathrm{Hol}_q(S^2)$. Since $\\mathrm{Hol}(S^2) = \\mathrm{SO}(2)$, we have $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M) \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2) \\times \\mathrm{SO}(2)$.\n    This group acts on the tangent space $T_oM = T_pS^2 \\oplus T_qS^2$. The action is reducible, with $T_pS^2$ and $T_qS^2$ being invariant subspaces. Let us choose an orthonormal basis for $T_oM$ adapted to this splitting. Let $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_pS^2$ and $\\{e_3, e_4\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_qS^2$. Then $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_oM$.\n    A general element of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ can be represented by a rotation matrix $R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    A typical element of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_o(M)$ corresponds to a pair of rotations, one acting on $T_pS^2$ with angle $\\theta_1$ and another acting on $T_qS^2$ with angle $\\theta_2$. In the chosen basis, this element is represented by a $4 \\times 4$ block-diagonal matrix:\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    R(\\theta_1) & \\mathbf{0}_{2\\times2} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{0}_{2\\times2} & R(\\theta_2)\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\cos\\theta_1 & -\\sin\\theta_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    \\sin\\theta_1 & \\cos\\theta_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\cos\\theta_2 & -\\sin\\theta_2 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\sin\\theta_2 & \\cos\\theta_2\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    This is the explicit matrix representation of a general element of the restricted holonomy group at $o$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta_{1} & -\\sin\\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\theta_{1} & \\cos\\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cos\\theta_{2} & -\\sin\\theta_{2} \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sin\\theta_{2} & \\cos\\theta_{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2994424"}, {"introduction": "The de Rham Decomposition Theorem tells us that a simply connected manifold can be broken down into a product of irreducible factors.

The corresponding dimensions of the tangent spaces are $\\dim(V_1)=6$ and $\\dim(V_2)=4$.\n\n### Part 1: Curvature Tensor of the Product Manifold\n\nThe first step is to analyze the curvature tensor $R$ of the product metric $g = g_{1} \\oplus g_{2}$. We are given that the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$ splits. This means that if we take vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$, and decompose them as $X = X_{1} + X_{2}$ and $Y = Y_{1} + Y_{2}$ (where $X_i, Y_i$ are lifts of vector fields on $M_i$), then the connection acts component-wise:\n$$ \\nabla_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X_{1}+X_{2}}(Y_{1}+Y_{2}) = \\nabla^{1}_{X_{1}}Y_{1} + \\nabla^{2}_{X_{2}}Y_{2} $$\nHere, $\\nabla^{1}$ and $\\nabla^{2}$ are the Levi-Civita connections on $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. This implies that for vector fields from different factors, the covariant derivative is zero, e.g., $\\nabla_{X_1}Y_2 = 0$ and $\\nabla_{X_2}Y_1 = 0$. Also, for the natural lifts of vector fields, the Lie bracket of fields from different factors vanishes, i.e., $[X_1, X_2] = 0$.\n\nThe curvature tensor is defined by $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$. We evaluate this for vector fields $u, v, w$ at the point $p$ belonging to the subspaces $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$.\n\nCase 1: $u, v, w \\in V_{1}$. Let $U, V, W$ be local extensions to $M$ which are tangent to the $M_1$ factor. Then $\\nabla_U W = \\nabla^1_U W$, so $R(U,V)W = \\nabla^1_U\\nabla^1_V W - \\nabla^1_V\\nabla^1_U W - \\nabla^1_{[U,V]}W = R^1(U,V)W$.\n\nCase 2: $u, v, w \\in V_{2}$. Similarly, $R(u,v)w = R^2(u,v)w$.\n\nCase 3: Mixed vector arguments. We show that all mixed curvature terms vanish. We demonstrate two key examples.\nLet $u, v \\in V_{1}$ and $w \\in V_{2}$. Let $U, V, W$ be their corresponding local extensions.\n$$ R(U,V)W = \\nabla_{U}\\nabla_{V}W - \\nabla_{V}\\nabla_{U}W - \\nabla_{[U,V]}W $$\nSince $V$ is a field on $M_1$ and $W$ is a field on $M_2$, $\\nabla_{V}W = 0$. Similarly, $\\nabla_{U}W = 0$. The Lie bracket $[U,V]$ is a vector field on $M_1$, so $\\nabla_{[U,V]}W = 0$. Therefore, $R(u,v)w = 0$. This means the curvature operator $R(u,v)$ for $u,v \\in V_1$ maps the subspace $V_2$ to zero. A symmetric argument shows that for $u,v \\in V_2$, $R(u,v)$ maps $V_1$ to zero.\n\nLet $u \\in V_{1}$, $v \\in V_{2}$, and $w \\in T_p M = V_1 \\oplus V_2$. Let $w = w_1+w_2$.\n$$ R(U,V)W = \\nabla_{U}\\nabla_{V}W - \\nabla_{V}\\nabla_{U}W - \\nabla_{[U,V]}W $$\nFor the chosen extensions, $[U,V]=0$.\n$\\nabla_V W = \\nabla_V(W_1+W_2) = \\nabla_V W_1 + \\nabla_V W_2 = 0 + \\nabla^2_V W_2$. So $\\nabla_U(\\nabla_V W) = \\nabla_U(\\nabla^2_V W_2) = 0$.\n$\\nabla_U W = \\nabla_U(W_1+W_2) = \\nabla^1_U W_1 + \\nabla_U W_2 = \\nabla^1_U W_1 + 0$. So $\\nabla_V(\\nabla_U W) = \\nabla_V(\\nabla^1_U W_1) = 0$.\nThus, $R(u,v)w=0$. This implies any curvature endomorphism with arguments from different factors is the zero operator.\n\nIn summary, the curvature tensor $R$ at $p$ acts non-trivially only when all its arguments are in the same subspace, either $V_1$ or $V_2$. If we write $X=X_1+X_2$, $Y=Y_1+Y_2$, $Z=Z_1+Z_2$, then:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = R(X_1, Y_1)Z_1 + R(X_2, Y_2)Z_2 $$\nThis shows that $R$ at $p$ decomposes. Any curvature endomorphism $R(X,Y)$ preserves the splitting $V_1 \\oplus V_2$, acting as $R^1(X_1,Y_1)$ on $V_1$ and $R^2(X_2,Y_2)$ on $V_2$.\n\n### Part 2: Structure of the Holonomy Lie Algebra\n\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem states that the holonomy Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)$ is generated by all operators of the form $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y) P_{\\gamma}$, for all $X,Y \\in T_{p}M$ and all loops $\\gamma$ at $p$. Here $P_\\gamma$ is the parallel transport operator along $\\gamma$.\n\nSince the connection $\\nabla$ preserves the direct sum decomposition $T M \\cong \\pi_1^* T M_1 \\oplus \\pi_2^* T M_2$, parallel transport along any curve in $M$ must also preserve this splitting. Thus, for any loop $\\gamma$ at $p$, the operator $P_{\\gamma}$ is block-diagonal with respect to the splitting $V_1 \\oplus V_2$. This means $P_{\\gamma} \\in \\mathrm{O}(V_1) \\times \\mathrm{O}(V_2)$.\n\nLet $P_{\\gamma} = P_{\\gamma}^{(1)} \\oplus P_{\\gamma}^{(2)}$.\nThe generators of $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)$ are of the form $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y) P_{\\gamma}$.\nIf $X, Y \\in V_{1}$, then $P_{\\gamma}X \\in V_{1}$ and $P_{\\gamma}Y \\in V_{1}$. From Part 1, we know $R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y)$ acts as $R^1(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y)$ on $V_1$ and is zero on $V_2$. Since $P_\\gamma$ and its inverse are block-diagonal, the full operator $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R(P_{\\gamma}X, P_{\\gamma}Y) P_{\\gamma}$ is also block-diagonal, with its non-zero part acting only on $V_1$. A similar argument holds for $X, Y \\in V_2$. If $X \\in V_1, Y \\in V_2$, the curvature operator is zero.\n\nThus, all generators of $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g)$ are block-diagonal. The Lie algebra they generate must also consist of block-diagonal endomorphisms. This implies $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(M,g) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1) \\oplus \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$ (identifying the algebras with their matrix representations on $V_1$ and $V_2$).\n\nTo establish equality, we use the fact that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are simply connected. Any loop $\\gamma_1$ in $M_1$ based at $p_1$ can be lifted to a loop $\\gamma = (\\gamma_1, c_{p_2})$ in $M$, where $c_{p_2}$ is the constant loop at $p_2$. The parallel transport along $\\gamma$ is $P_{\\gamma} = P_{\\gamma_1}^{1} \\oplus I_2$, where $I_2$ is the identity on $V_2$. The generators obtained from such loops and vectors $X,Y \\in V_1$ are $(P_{\\gamma_1}^{1})^{-1}R^1(P_{\\gamma_1}^{1}X, P_{\\gamma_1}^{1}Y)P_{\\gamma_1}^{1} \\oplus 0$. By the Ambrose-Singer theorem applied to $M_1$, this set of operators generates $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1)$ in the first block of the direct sum.\n\nSymmetrically, by lifting loops from $M_2$, we generate $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$ in the second block. Since the set of generators for the first block commutes with the set of generators for the second block, the Lie algebra generated by their union is their direct sum. Therefore, we conclude:\n$$ \\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M,g) \\cong \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_{1}}(M_{1},g_{1}) \\oplus \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_{2}}(M_{2},g_{2}) $$\nThe ideals are $\\mathfrak{h}_1 = \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_{1}}(M_{1},g_{1}) \\oplus \\{0\\}$ and $\\mathfrak{h}_2 = \\{0\\} \\oplus \\mathfrak{hol}_{p_{2}}(M_{2},g_{2})$, which commute with each other.\n\n### Part 3: Dimension of the Holonomy Lie Algebra\n\nFrom Part 2, the dimension of the product holonomy algebra is the sum of the dimensions of the factor holonomy algebras:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M,g)) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_{1}}(M_{1},g_{1})) + \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_{2}}(M_{2},g_{2})) $$\nThe problem states that the holonomy group of $(M_1, g_1)$ is $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$. The corresponding Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_1}(M_1,g_1)$ is $\\mathfrak{su}(3)$. The dimension of the special unitary Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ is $n^2-1$. For $n=3$:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{su}(3)) = 3^{2} - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 $$\nThe holonomy group of $(M_2, g_2)$ is $\\mathrm{Sp}(1)$. The corresponding Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_{p_2}(M_2,g_2)$ is $\\mathfrak{sp}(1)$. There is a well-known Lie group isomorphism $\\mathrm{Sp}(1) \\cong \\mathrm{SU}(2)$. This implies an isomorphism of their Lie algebras: $\\mathfrak{sp}(1) \\cong \\mathfrak{su}(2)$. Thus, we can compute the dimension of $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{sp}(1)) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{su}(2)) = 2^{2} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 $$\nFinally, the total dimension is the sum:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_{p}(M,g)) = 8 + 3 = 11 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "2990663"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how product structures lead to reducibility, we now turn to the construction of a genuinely irreducible manifold that is not itself a fundamental building block from Berger's list.

The manifold $P$ is the total space of a principal $\\mathrm{S}^1$-bundle over a simply connected Kähler manifold $(B, g_B)$ whose holonomy is $\\operatorname{SU}(n)$. The metric $g$ on $P$ is the Sasaki metric determined by the bundle structure and a connection $\\eta$.\n\nOur analysis proceeds in four main steps:\n1.  Decomposition of the tangent space and identification of the geometric structure.\n2.  Computation of the Riemann curvature tensor of $(P,g)$ using the framework of Riemannian submersions and Sasakian geometry.\n3.  Analysis of the action of the curvature endomorphisms on the tangent space to determine the irreducibility of the holonomy representation.\n4.  Identification of the Lie algebra of the restricted holonomy group and calculation of its dimension.\n\nStep 1: Geometric Structure\nThe projection $\\pi : P \\to B$ is a Riemannian submersion. At any point $p \\in P$, the tangent space $T_p P$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into the vertical space $V_p$ and the horizontal space $H_p$. The vertical space is spanned by the fundamental vector field of the $\\mathrm{S}^1$-action, which is the Reeb vector field $\\xi$. The horizontal space is the kernel of the connection $1$-form $\\eta$. Thus, $T_p P = H_p \\oplus \\operatorname{span}\\{\\xi_p\\}$. The dimension of $P$ is $2n+1$.\n\nThe given data define a Sasakian structure $(\\eta, \\xi, \\Phi, g)$ on $P$.\n- $\\xi$ is the unit-length Reeb vector field, satisfying $\\eta(\\xi)=1$.\n- $\\Phi$ is a tensor field of type $(1,1)$ defined by its action on vector fields. For a horizontal vector field $X$ (i.e., $\\eta(X)=0$), $\\Phi X$ is the horizontal lift of $J(\\pi_*X)$, where $J$ is the complex structure on $B$. For the vertical vector field, $\\Phi\\xi = 0$. On horizontal vectors, $\\Phi$ acts as an isometry satisfying $\\Phi^2 = -I + \\eta \\otimes \\xi$, which restricts to $\\Phi^2 = -I$ on $H_p$.\n- The condition $d\\eta = 2k\\,\\pi^*\\omega$ where $\\omega(\\cdot, \\cdot) = g_B(J\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the Kähler form on $B$, establishes the link between the geometry of the bundle and the base. For horizontal vector fields $X$ and $Y$, we have $d\\eta(X,Y) = 2k\\,\\omega(\\pi_*X, \\pi_*Y) = 2k\\,g_B(J\\pi_*X, \\pi_*Y) = 2k\\,g(\\Phi X, Y)$.\n- This structure is known as a K-contact structure. As the base manifold is Kähler, this structure is also normal, making $(P, \\eta, \\xi, \\Phi, g)$ a Sasakian manifold.\n\nEssential identities for a Sasakian manifold (scaled by $k$) include the covariant derivatives of $\\xi$ and $\\Phi$.\nFor a horizontal vector field $X$, the covariant derivative of $\\xi$ is given by $\\nabla_X \\xi = -k\\Phi X$. This can be derived from the Koszul formula or O'Neill's formulas. Furthermore, $\\nabla_\\xi \\xi = 0$ as $\\xi$ defines a flow of isometries and has unit length, making its integral curves geodesics.\nThe covariant derivative of $\\Phi$ is given by $(\\nabla_X \\Phi)Y = k(g(X,Y)\\xi - \\eta(Y)X)$ for any vector fields $X, Y$.\n\nStep 2: The Riemann Curvature Tensor\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group, $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$, is generated by the curvature endomorphisms $R(U,V) = \\nabla_U \\nabla_V - \\nabla_V \\nabla_U - \\nabla_{[U,V]}$ for all $U,V \\in T_p P$. We compute the key components of $R$.\n\n- Curvature for horizontal inputs: For horizontal vector fields $X, Y, Z$, the curvature $R(X,Y)Z$ can be related to the curvature $R^B$ of the base manifold $B$ by O'Neill's formula, which for a Sasakian manifold over a Kähler manifold simplifies to:\n$$R(X,Y)Z = R^B(X,Y)Z - k^2 \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y + g(\\Phi Y,Z)\\Phi X - g(\\Phi X,Z)\\Phi Y - 2g(\\Phi X,Y)\\Phi Z \\right)$$\nwhere $R^B(X,Y)Z$ is the horizontal lift of $R^B_{\\pi_*X, \\pi_*Y}(\\pi_*Z)$.\nFurthermore, $R(X,Y)\\xi = 0$. This indicates that curvature operators with only horizontal inputs preserve the horizontal-vertical decomposition.\n\n- Curvature with a vertical input: The crucial components are those involving $\\xi$, as they can mix the horizontal and vertical subspaces. We compute $R(X,\\xi)Y$ for horizontal $X,Y$:\n$$R(X,\\xi)Y = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_\\xi Y) - \\nabla_\\xi(\\nabla_X Y) - \\nabla_{[X,\\xi]}Y$$\nUsing Sasakian identities, one can show $\\nabla_\\xi Y = -k\\Phi Y - [\\xi,X]_h$ for a horizontal $Y$. If we choose a basic horizontal field $Y$ (lift of a field from $B$), then $[\\xi,Y]=0$ and $\\nabla_\\xi Y = -k\\Phi Y$.\n$\\nabla_X(\\nabla_\\xi Y) = \\nabla_X(-k\\Phi Y) = -k(\\nabla_X\\Phi)Y - k\\Phi(\\nabla_X Y) = -k(k g(X,Y)\\xi) - k\\Phi(\\nabla_X Y)$.\n$\\nabla_\\xi(\\nabla_X Y)$ can also be computed, and the result simplifies to:\n$$R(X,\\xi)Y = -k^2 g(X,Y)\\xi$$\nThis shows that $R(X,\\xi)$ maps a horizontal vector $Y$ to a vertical vector.\n\nNext, we compute the action on $\\xi$:\n$$R(X,\\xi)\\xi = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_\\xi\\xi) - \\nabla_\\xi(\\nabla_X\\xi) - \\nabla_{[X,\\xi]}\\xi$$\nSince $\\nabla_\\xi\\xi=0$ and $\\nabla_X\\xi=-k\\Phi X$, we have:\n$$R(X,\\xi)\\xi = -\\nabla_\\xi(-k\\Phi X) - \\nabla_{[X,\\xi]}\\xi$$\nAssuming a basic field $X$, $[\\xi,X]=0$. Then $(\\nabla_\\xi \\Phi)X = 0$. Thus, $\\nabla_\\xi(-k\\Phi X) = -k\\Phi(\\nabla_\\xi X) = -k\\Phi(-k\\Phi X) = k^2\\Phi^2 X = -k^2 X$.\nSo, $R(X,\\xi)\\xi = -(-k^2 X) = k^2 X$.\nThis shows that $R(X,\\xi)$ maps the vertical vector $\\xi$ to a horizontal vector.\n\nStep 3: Irreducibility of the Holonomy Representation\nThe holonomy representation on $T_p P$ is irreducible if there are no proper non-trivial subspaces of $T_p P$ that are invariant under all curvature endomorphisms $R(U,V)$.\nLet $W$ be an invariant subspace of $T_p P$.\n- Suppose $W$ contains a non-zero horizontal vector $X_0 \\in H_p$. Then for any $Y \\in H_p$ such that $g(X_0, Y) \\neq 0$ (e.g., $Y=X_0$), the vector $R(X_0, \\xi)Y = -k^2 g(X_0,Y)\\xi$ must be in $W$. Since $k \\neq 0$ and $g(X_0,X_0) \\neq 0$, this implies that $\\xi \\in W$.\n- Suppose $W$ contains the vector $\\xi$. Then for any non-zero horizontal vector $X \\in H_p$, the vector $R(X,\\xi)\\xi = k^2 X$ must be in $W$. Since $k \\neq 0$, this means every horizontal vector $X$ is in $W$. Thus, $H_p \\subseteq W$.\n\nCombining these, if a non-zero invariant subspace $W$ contains any single non-zero vector (horizontal or vertical), it must contain all of $H_p$ and $\\operatorname{span}\\{\\xi\\}$, so $W=T_p P$. The only invariant subspaces are $\\{0\\}$ and $T_p P$.\nTherefore, the holonomy representation is irreducible. The condition for this is $k \\neq 0$, which is given in the problem statement.\n\nStep 4: Identification of the Holonomy Algebra and its Dimension\nSince $(P,g)$ is a simply connected (or considering the restricted holonomy group on a non-simply connected space) irreducible Riemannian manifold of dimension $2n+1$, its holonomy group must be on Berger's list. For an odd-dimensional manifold of dimension $m=2n+1 \\ge 5$ (since $n \\ge 2$), the only possibilities for a non-symmetric space are $\\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)$ or, if $2n+1=7$, the exceptional group $G_2$. A $G_2$ manifold must be Ricci-flat. The Ricci tensor of $(P,g)$ is not zero (e.g., $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\xi,\\xi)=2nk^2$), so the holonomy cannot be $G_2$.\nThe holonomy group must therefore be $\\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)$.\n\nWe can confirm this by examining the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$ generated by the curvature endomorphisms.\nThe operators $R(X,\\xi)$ for $X \\in H_p$ generate a subspace of $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$. Let's consider the commutator of two such operators, $[R(X,\\xi), R(Y,\\xi)]$.\nA direct computation shows that for any $Z \\in H_p$:\n$$[R(X,\\xi), R(Y,\\xi)](Z) = k^4 (g(X,Z)Y - g(Y,Z)X)$$\nAnd $[R(X,\\xi), R(Y,\\xi)](\\xi)=0$.\nThe set of operators $Z \\mapsto g(X,Z)Y - g(Y,Z)X$ for all $X,Y \\in H_p$ generates the entire Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(H_p) \\cong \\mathfrak{so}(2n)$. Since $k \\neq 0$, the commutators generate a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$ isomorphic to $\\mathfrak{so}(2n)$, which acts on $H_p$.\nThe algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}(p)$ also contains the operators $R(X,\\xi)$ themselves, which provide the \"mixing\" components between $H_p$ and $V_p$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2n+1)$ can be represented by block matrices $\\begin{pmatrix} A & -v^T \\\\ v & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ where $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(2n)$ and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Our generated algebra contains all such matrices.\nThus, the Lie algebra of the restricted holonomy group is $\\mathfrak{hol}(p) = \\mathfrak{so}(2n+1)$.\n\nThe restricted holonomy group is $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(P,g) = \\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)$.\nThe problem asks for the real dimension of this group. The dimension of the special orthogonal group $\\operatorname{SO}(m)$ is given by $\\binom{m}{2} = \\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$.\nFor $m=2n+1$, the dimension is:\n$$\\dim(\\operatorname{SO}(2n+1)) = \\frac{(2n+1)((2n+1)-1)}{2} = \\frac{(2n+1)(2n)}{2} = n(2n+1) = 2n^2 + n$$\nThis is the real dimension of the restricted holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}^0(P,g)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2n^{2} + n}$$", "id": "2981105"}]}
