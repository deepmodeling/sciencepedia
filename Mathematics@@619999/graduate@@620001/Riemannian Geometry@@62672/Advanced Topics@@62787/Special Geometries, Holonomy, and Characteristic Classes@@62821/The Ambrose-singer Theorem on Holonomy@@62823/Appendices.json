We must first verify that the induced connection $\\nabla$ is flat, and then compute its holonomy around the generator of the fundamental group of $S^1$.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given objects. The base manifold is the circle $M = S^1$, which is identified with the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$. The universal covering space of $M$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, with the covering map $\\pi \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ given by $\\pi(t) = [t] = t \\pmod{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\nThe total space of the covering bundle is $\\tilde{E} = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$, which is a trivial line bundle over the base space $\\mathbb{R}$. A point in $\\tilde{E}$ is denoted by $(t, v)$, where $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the base coordinate and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the fiber coordinate. The connection on this bundle is the standard flat connection, $\\tilde{\\nabla} = d$, the exterior derivative. A section of this bundle is a function $s \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and its covariant derivative with respect to a vector field $X$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\tilde{\\nabla}_X s = X(s)$.\n\nThe group of deck transformations of the covering $\\pi \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ is $\\Gamma = \\mathbb{Z}$, acting on $\\mathbb{R}$ by $n \\cdot t = t+n$. This action is lifted to an action on the total space $\\tilde{E}$ as specified:\n$$\nn \\cdot (t, v) = (t+n, (-1)^n v)\n$$\nfor $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The quotient bundle is $E = \\tilde{E}/\\Gamma \\to M$. The connection $\\nabla$ on $E$ is induced by $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ on $\\tilde{E}$.\n\n**Part 1: Verification of Flatness**\n\nThe curvature of a connection is a tensor, which means its value at a point depends only on the local properties of the connection around that point. The connection $\\nabla$ on $E$ is defined such that the quotient map $p \\colon \\tilde{E} \\to E$ is a morphism of vector bundles with connection. This means that for any open set $U \\subset M$ and a local section $s$ of $E$ over $U$, if we lift $s$ to a local section $\\tilde{s}$ of $\\tilde{E}$ over an open set $\\tilde{U} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\pi(\\tilde{U}) = U$, then $\\nabla s$ is the projection of $\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{s}$.\n\nThe curvature tensor of the connection $\\tilde{\\nabla} = d$ on $\\tilde{E}$ is $F_{\\tilde{\\nabla}}$. For any pair of vector fields $X, Y$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, the curvature is given by $F_{\\tilde{\\nabla}}(X,Y) = \\tilde{\\nabla}_X \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y - \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y \\tilde{\\nabla}_X - \\tilde{\\nabla}_{[X,Y]}$. Since $\\tilde{\\nabla} = d$, this is $F_{\\tilde{\\nabla}}(X,Y)s = X(Y(s)) - Y(X(s)) - [X,Y](s)$. By the definition of the Lie bracket, $[X,Y](s) = X(Y(s)) - Y(X(s))$, so $F_{\\tilde{\\nabla}}(X,Y)s = 0$ for all sections $s$. Therefore, the curvature of $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ is $F_{\\tilde{\\nabla}} = 0$, which is expected as $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ is the exterior derivative on a trivial bundle.\n\nThe projection $\\pi \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ is a local diffeomorphism. For any point $x \\in S^1$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets, each mapped diffeomorphically onto $U$ by $\\pi$. Let $\\tilde{U}$ be one such open set. The bundle $E$ restricted to $U$, denoted $E|_U$, is isomorphic to the bundle $\\tilde{E}$ restricted to $\\tilde{U}$, $\\tilde{E}|_{\\tilde{U}}$. This isomorphism also identifies the connection $\\nabla$ on $E|_U$ with the connection $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ on $\\tilde{E}|_{\\tilde{U}}$.\n\nSince the curvature $F_\\nabla$ is a tensor, its value at any point $x \\in M$ can be computed in a local chart. In such a chart, $\\nabla$ is identified with $\\tilde{\\nabla}$, and thus its curvature $F_\\nabla$ is identified with $F_{\\tilde{\\nabla}}$. As we have shown that $F_{\\tilde{\\nabla}}=0$ everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$, it follows that $F_\\nabla=0$ everywhere on $M$. Thus, the connection $\\nabla$ is flat.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of Holonomy**\n\nWe are asked to compute the holonomy of $\\nabla$ along the loop $\\gamma \\colon [0,1] \\to S^1$ given by $\\gamma(t) = [t]$. The holonomy is a linear transformation of the fiber over the base point of the loop, which for a line bundle is simply multiplication by a scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\times}$. This transformation describes the result of parallel transporting a vector along the loop $\\gamma$.\n\nThe starting and ending point of the loop is $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = [0]$. Let us denote this point by $p_0 \\in S^1$. The fiber over $p_0$ is $E_{p_0}$. We can identify this fiber with $\\mathbb{R}$ by choosing a representative point in the covering space, say $\\tilde{p}_0 = 0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A vector $u_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ in the fiber $E_{p_0}$ is represented by the equivalence class of the vector $(0, u_0)$ in the fiber $\\tilde{E}_0$ of the covering bundle. So we represent the initial vector as $v(0) = [(0, u_0)] \\in E_{p_0}$.\n\nTo compute the parallel transport along $\\gamma$, we lift the path and the vector to the covering bundle $\\tilde{E}$. The loop $\\gamma(t) = [t]$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ lifts to the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = t$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, starting at $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)=0$ and ending at $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)=1$. The initial vector $v(0)$ lifts to the vector $\\tilde{v}(0) = (0, u_0) \\in \\tilde{E}_0$.\n\nNow, we parallel transport $\\tilde{v}(0)$ along the lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ using the connection $\\tilde{\\nabla}=d$. We seek a path of vectors $\\tilde{v}(t) = (t, u(t))$ in $\\tilde{E}$ that covers $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ and satisfies the parallel transport equation $\\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(t)} \\tilde{v}(t) = 0$. The tangent vector to the path is $\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(t) = 1$ (as the vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$). For a section represented by the function $u(t)$, the covariant derivative is simply the ordinary derivative. The parallel transport equation becomes $\\frac{d}{dt}u(t) = 0$.\nThe solution to this equation with the initial condition $u(0)=u_0$ is $u(t) = u_0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nSo, the lifted parallel-transported path of vectors is $\\tilde{v}(t) = (t, u_0)$.\n\nAt the end of the path, $t=1$, the transported vector in the covering bundle is $\\tilde{v}(1) = (1, u_0)$, which lies in the fiber $\\tilde{E}_1$. To find the vector in the quotient bundle $E$, we project $\\tilde{v}(1)$ down. The resulting vector is $v(1) = [(1, u_0)]$. This vector lies in the fiber $E_{[1]}$. Since $[1]=[0]=p_0$, this vector is in the same fiber as the initial vector $v(0)$.\n\nThe holonomy transformation maps the initial vector $v(0)$ to the final vector $v(1)$. We must express $v(1)$ in terms of $v(0)$. That is, we seek a scalar $\\lambda$ such that $v(1) = \\lambda \\cdot v(0)$. In our representation:\n$$\n[(1, u_0)] = \\lambda \\cdot [(0, u_0)]\n$$\nThe scalar multiplication in the fiber is defined as $\\lambda \\cdot [(t,u)] = [(t, \\lambda u)]$. So we have:\n$$\n[(1, u_0)] = [(0, \\lambda u_0)]\n$$\nTwo points $[(t,v)]$ and $[(t',v')]$ in $E$ are equal if and only if there exists an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $(t,v) = n \\cdot (t', v') = (t'+n, (-1)^n v')$.\nApplying this to our equation, there must exist an $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that:\n$$\n(1, u_0) = n \\cdot (0, \\lambda u_0) = (0+n, (-1)^n \\lambda u_0)\n$$\nBy comparing the components, we get two equations:\n1. $1 = n$\n2. $u_0 = (-1)^n \\lambda u_0$\n\nSubstituting $n=1$ into the second equation gives $u_0 = (-1)^1 \\lambda u_0 = -\\lambda u_0$.\nAssuming we started with a non-zero vector $u_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $u_0$ to find $1 = -\\lambda$, which implies $\\lambda = -1$.\n\nThis result, $\\lambda = -1$, is the monodromy of the connection. It corresponds to the representation of the fundamental group $\\rho \\colon \\pi_1(S^1) \\to GL(1, \\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}^\\times$ that defines the flat bundle. The generator $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\pi_1(S^1)$ is mapped to $\\rho(1) = (-1)^1 = -1$. The holonomy along the loop representing the generator is precisely this value.\n\nThe monodromy is indeed the scalar $\\lambda = -1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-1} $$", "id": "2992481"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational understanding of holonomy, this practice guides you through a direct application of the Ambrose-Singer theorem.

Let $X, Y, Z$ be horizontal vector fields (lifts from $N$) and let $e_0 = \\partial_t$. We note that for such fields, $[e_0, X] = 0$.\n\n1.  $\\nabla_{e_0} e_0$: Let $U=V=e_0$.\n    $2g(\\nabla_{e_0}e_0, W) = 2e_0(g(e_0,W)) - W(g(e_0,e_0))$.\n    If $W=e_0$, $g(e_0,e_0)=1$, so $2g(\\nabla_{e_0}e_0, e_0) = -e_0(1) = 0$.\n    If $W=X$, $g(e_0,X)=0$ and $g(e_0,e_0)=1$, so $2g(\\nabla_{e_0}e_0, X) = -X(1)=0$.\n    Thus, $\\nabla_{e_0} e_0 = 0$.\n\n2.  $\\nabla_X e_0$ and $\\nabla_{e_0} X$: Since $\\nabla$ is torsion-free, $\\nabla_X e_0 = \\nabla_{e_0} X - [X, e_0] = \\nabla_{e_0} X$. Let $U=e_0, V=X$.\n    If $W=e_0$, $2g(\\nabla_{e_0}X, e_0) = e_0(g(X,e_0)) + X(g(e_0,e_0)) - e_0(g(e_0,X)) = 0 + X(1) - 0 = 0$. So $\\nabla_{e_0}X$ is horizontal.\n    If $W=Y$ (horizontal), $2g(\\nabla_{e_0}X, Y) = e_0(g(X,Y)) + X(g(e_0,Y)) - Y(g(e_0,X)) = e_0(f(t)^2 h(X,Y))$.\n    Since $X,Y$ are lifts from $N$, $h(X,Y)$ does not depend on $t$.\n    $2g(\\nabla_{e_0}X, Y) = 2f(t)f'(t)h(X,Y)$.\n    $g(\\nabla_{e_0}X, Y) = f(t)^2 h(\\nabla_{e_0}X, Y)$, so $2f(t)^2 h(\\nabla_{e_0}X, Y) = 2f(t)f'(t)h(X,Y)$.\n    For $f(t) \\neq 0$, this yields $h(\\nabla_{e_0}X, Y) = \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}h(X,Y)$.

A direct consequence is that the Lie algebra generated by the curvature endomorphisms at $p$, denoted $\\text{Lie}(\\mathfrak{g}_p)$ where $\\mathfrak{g}_p=\\text{span}\\{R_p(U,V)\\}$, is a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(g)$. Also, $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(g)$ must be a subalgebra of the Lie algebra of the special orthogonal group of the tangent space, $\\mathfrak{so}(T_p M, g_p)$. At $p=(t_0, x_0)$, the tangent space $T_p M$ has dimension $m+1$, so $\\mathfrak{hol}_p(g) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{so}(m+1)$.\n\nWe identify the Lie algebra generated by the curvature endomorphisms at $p$. Let $\\{\\hat{E}_i\\}_{i=1}^m$ be an orthonormal basis for $(T_{x_0}N, h_{x_0})$. Then $\\{e_0, \\hat{E}_1/f_0, \\dots, \\hat{E}_m/f_0\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $(T_p M, g_p)$. We identify $T_p M \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ using this basis.\n\nThe subspace of endomorphisms spanned by $\\{R_p(X,Y) \\mid X,Y \\in T_{x_0}N\\}$ acts on $T_{x_0}N$. The problem states that $\\text{span}\\{R^N_{x_0}(X,Y)\\} = \\mathfrak{so}(T_{x_0}N, h_{x_0})$. The additional term $(f'_0)^2(h(Y,Z)X - h(X,Z)Y)$ also corresponds to an element of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{x_0}N, h_{x_0})$. Thus, the span of all such operators on $T_{x_0}N$ remains $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{x_0}N, h_{x_0}) \\cong \\mathfrak{so}(m)$. In the basis of $T_p M$, these are matrices of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & A \\end{pmatrix}$ where $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(m)$. Let this set be $\\mathfrak{a}$.\n\nThe endomorphisms $\\{R_p(e_0, X) \\mid X \\in T_{x_0}N \\}$ are, in the chosen orthonormal basis, represented by matrices of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -v^T \\\\ v & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. This follows from part (b) with $\\lambda = f''_0/f_0 \\neq 0$ (due to the given condition $f''(t_0) \\neq 0$). Let this set of matrices be $\\mathfrak{b}$.\n\nThe vector space of curvature endomorphisms at $p$ is $\\mathfrak{g}_p = \\mathfrak{a} \\oplus \\mathfrak{b}$. Let us check if this space is a Lie algebra by computing commutators:\n1.  $[\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{a}] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{a}$: True, as $\\mathfrak{so}(m)$ is a Lie algebra.\n2.  $[\\mathfrak{b}, \\mathfrak{b}]$: The commutator of two elements from $\\mathfrak{b}$ is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & vw^T - wv^T \\end{pmatrix}$, where $vw^T - wv^T \\in \\mathfrak{so}(m)$. Thus, $[\\mathfrak{b}, \\mathfrak{b}] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{a}$.\n3.  $[\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{b}]$: The commutator of an element from $\\mathfrak{a}$ and an element from $\\mathfrak{b}$ is an element of $\\mathfrak{b}$.\n\nThe space $\\mathfrak{g}_p$ is closed under the Lie bracket, so it is a Lie algebra.

We will solve this by applying the Ambrose–Singer theorem and related results from Riemannian geometry.\n\nLet us first establish the notation and recall the given information.\nThe manifold $(M,g)$ has dimension $n=6$. The holonomy Lie algebra at $p \\in M$, denoted $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$, is a Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_p M) \\cong \\mathfrak{so}(6)$. The dimension of this ambient space is $\\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(6)) = \\frac{6(6-1)}{2} = 15$.\nThe Riemann curvature tensor at $p$, $R_p$, gives rise to a linear map $\\Phi : \\Lambda^{2} T_p M \\to \\mathfrak{so}(T_p M)$ via $\\Phi(u \\wedge v) = R_p(u,v)$. Let $K_0 = \\operatorname{Im}(\\Phi)$ be the vector subspace of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_p M)$ spanned by the curvature endomorphisms at $p$. We are given that $\\dim(K_0) = 8$.\n\nFor any piecewise smooth loop $\\gamma$ based at $p$, the parallel transport map $\\tau_{\\gamma}$ is an element of the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$. The problem defines a set $\\mathcal{C} = \\big\\{ \\operatorname{Ad}_{\\tau_{\\gamma}}(A) : A \\in K_0, \\ \\gamma \\text{ is a loop at } p \\big\\}$, where $\\operatorname{Ad}_{h}(A) = h A h^{-1}$. The linear span of this set is a subspace $U = \\operatorname{span}(\\mathcal{C})$. The givens are:\n1. $\\dim(K_0) = 8$.\n2. $\\dim(U) = 10$.\n3. $U$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_p M)$, meaning $[U, U] \\subseteq U$.\n\nOur goal is to determine $\\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_p)$. We will achieve this by demonstrating that $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ is identical to the given subspace $U$. This requires proving the two inclusions $U \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_p$ and $\\mathfrak{hol}_p \\subseteq U$.\n\n**Part 1: Proving $U \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_p$**\nThe Ambrose–Singer theorem implies that the holonomy algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ is generated by the curvature tensor and all its covariant derivatives. Let $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$ be the vector space spanned by all tensors $(\\nabla_{V_1} \\dots \\nabla_{V_k} R)_p$ for $k \\ge 0$. Then $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ is the Lie algebra generated by $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$. This means, in particular, that $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$ is a subspace of $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$. The space $K_0 = \\operatorname{Im}(\\Phi)$ corresponds to the $k=0$ case, so $K_0 \\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}'(p) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_p$.\n\nThe holonomy algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ is the Lie algebra of the holonomy group $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$. A fundamental property of Lie algebras is that they are invariant under the adjoint action of their corresponding Lie group. This means that for any $A \\in \\mathfrak{hol}_p$ and any $h \\in \\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$, we have $\\operatorname{Ad}_{h}(A) \\in \\mathfrak{hol}_p$.\n\nSince we have established that $K_0 \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_p$, it follows that for any $A \\in K_0$ and any $h \\in \\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$, the element $\\operatorname{Ad}_{h}(A)$ must also be in $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$. The set of all such elements, for all loops $\\gamma$ (which generate $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$), is precisely the set $\\mathcal{C}$ defined in the problem. So, $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_p$.\nSince $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ is a vector space, it must contain the linear span of any of its subsets. Therefore, $U = \\operatorname{span}(\\mathcal{C}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_p$.\n\n**Part 2: Proving $\\mathfrak{hol}_p \\subseteq U$**\nThis is the more subtle part of the argument. We start with the space $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$ spanned by the curvature tensor and all its covariant derivatives at $p$, i.e., $\\mathfrak{g}'(p) = \\operatorname{span}\\{(\\nabla^k R)_p \\mid k \\ge 0\\}$.\nA key theorem of differential geometry (e.g., Kobayashi & Nomizu, Vol. I) characterizes $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$ as the smallest vector subspace of $\\mathfrak{so}(T_p M)$ which\n(a) contains $K_0 = \\operatorname{Im}(\\Phi)$, and\n(b) is invariant under the adjoint action of the holonomy algebra, i.e., $[\\mathfrak{hol}_p, \\mathfrak{g}'(p)] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}'(p)$.\n\nWe will now show that the given space $U$ satisfies these two properties.\n(a) The space $U$ is defined as the span of $\\mathcal{C} = \\{\\operatorname{Ad}_{\\tau_{\\gamma}}(A) \\mid A \\in K_0, \\ldots\\}$. By considering the constant loop $\\gamma(t)=p$, for which $\\tau_{\\gamma}$ is the identity map, we see that $K_0 \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\subseteq U$. Thus, property (a) is satisfied by $U$.\n\n(b) We must show that $U$ is invariant under the adjoint action of $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$, i.e., $[\\mathfrak{hol}_p, U] \\subseteq U$. From its definition, $U = \\operatorname{span}(\\operatorname{Ad}(\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M))(K_0))$. Let us first show that $U$ is invariant under $\\operatorname{Ad}(\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M))$. Let $u \\in U$ and $h \\in \\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$. Since $u$ is a linear combination of elements of the form $\\operatorname{Ad}_{h'}(A)$ for $h' \\in \\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$ and $A \\in K_0$, we can write $u = \\sum_i c_i \\operatorname{Ad}_{h_i}(A_i)$. Then,\n$$ \\operatorname{Ad}_h(u) = \\sum_i c_i \\operatorname{Ad}_h(\\operatorname{Ad}_{h_i}(A_i)) = \\sum_i c_i \\operatorname{Ad}_{hh_i}(A_i) $$\nSince $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$ is a group, each $hh_i$ is also an element of $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ad}_h(u)$ is again a linear combination of elements in $\\mathcal{C}$, which means $\\operatorname{Ad}_h(u) \\in U$. So, $U$ is invariant under the adjoint action of $\\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$.\n\nThis invariance under the group action implies invariance under the corresponding Lie algebra action. For any $B \\in \\mathfrak{hol}_p$, the one-parameter subgroup $\\exp(tB)$ is in $\\operatorname{Hol}_p^0(M) \\subseteq \\operatorname{Hol}_p(M)$. For any $u \\in U$, we have $\\operatorname{Ad}_{\\exp(tB)}(u) \\in U$ for all $t$. Expanding this for small $t$ gives:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ad}_{\\exp(tB)}(u) = \\exp(\\operatorname{ad}_{tB})(u) = u + t[B,u] + O(t^2) \\in U $$\nSince $U$ is a vector subspace, it is topologically closed. The derivative of the curve $t \\mapsto u + t[B,u] + O(t^2)$ at $t=0$ must lie in $U$. This derivative is $[B,u]$. Thus, for any $B \\in \\mathfrak{hol}_p$ and $u \\in U$, we have $[B,u] \\in U$. This shows $[\\mathfrak{hol}_p, U] \\subseteq U$, so property (b) is satisfied by $U$.\n\nSince $U$ satisfies the defining properties (a) and (b) of $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$, and $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$ is the *smallest* such subspace, we must have $\\mathfrak{g}'(p) \\subseteq U$.\n\nNow we can invoke the Ambrose–Singer theorem, which states that $\\mathfrak{hol}_p$ is the Lie algebra generated by $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$, i.e., $\\mathfrak{hol}_p = \\text{LieAlg}(\\mathfrak{g}'(p))$.\nSince $\\mathfrak{g}'(p) \\subseteq U$, the Lie algebra generated by $\\mathfrak{g}'(p)$ must be a subalgebra of the Lie algebra generated by $U$:\n$$ \\mathfrak{hol}_p = \\text{LieAlg}(\\mathfrak{g}'(p)) \\subseteq \\text{LieAlg}(U) $$\nWe are given in the problem statement that $U$ is a Lie algebra. The Lie algebra generated by a space that is already a Lie algebra is the space itself. So, $\\text{LieAlg}(U) = U$.\nThis leads to the inclusion $\\mathfrak{hol}_p \\subseteq U$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have proven both $U \\subseteq \\mathfrak{hol}_p$ and $\\mathfrak{hol}_p \\subseteq U$. This forces the equality $U = \\mathfrak{hol}_p$.\nThe problem states that the dimension of the subspace $U$ is $10$. Therefore, the dimension of the holonomy algebra must also be $10$.\n$$ \\dim(\\mathfrak{hol}_p) = \\dim(U) = 10 $$\nThe given information that $\\dim(\\operatorname{Im}\\Phi)=8$ and $\\dim(M)=6$ serves to ensure the problem is well-defined, but the exact values are not needed for the final deduction, which relies on the structural properties provided.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "2992505"}]}
