The answer does not require rounding.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the explicit coordinate expression for the Dirac operator $D$ on the trivial spinor bundle over $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\delta)$.\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the Dirac operator acting on a spinor field $\\psi \\in \\Gamma(S)$:\n$$\nD\\psi = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(e_{i})\\,\\nabla_{e_{i}} \\psi\n$$\nHere, $\\{e_{1}, \\dots, e_{n}\\}$ is the global orthonormal frame given by the coordinate vector fields $e_{i} = \\partial_{x_{i}}$. The term $c(\\cdot)$ denotes Clifford multiplication, and $\\nabla$ is the spinor covariant derivative.\n\nThe spinor covariant derivative $\\nabla_{X}\\psi$ in the direction of a vector field $X$, with respect to a local orthonormal frame $\\{e_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{n}$, is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\nabla_{X}\\psi = X(\\psi) + \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} g(\\nabla_{X}^{\\text{LC}} e_{j}, e_{k}) c(e_{j})c(e_{k})\\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla^{\\text{LC}}$ is the Levi-Civita connection on the tangent bundle. The term $X(\\psi)$ denotes the directional derivative of the components of $\\psi$ in a trivialization of the spinor bundle. Since the spinor bundle over $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is trivial, we can identify $\\psi$ with a function from $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to a fixed vector space (the spinor space), and $X(\\psi)$ is the standard directional derivative of this vector-valued function.\n\nLet us specialize this formula to $X = e_{i}$. The connection coefficients (or Christoffel symbols) of $\\nabla^{\\text{LC}}$ in the frame $\\{e_{j}\\}$ are defined by $\\nabla_{e_{i}}^{\\text{LC}} e_{j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\Gamma_{ij}^{k} e_{k}$. For an orthonormal frame, the metric components are $g(e_j, e_k) = \\delta_{jk}$.

That is, $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k} = 0$ for all $i, j, k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This is because the metric components $\\delta_{ij}$ (which are simply the Kronecker delta in Cartesian coordinates) are constant throughout $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nSubstituting $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}=0$ into the expression for the spinor covariant derivative, the second term containing the sum vanishes completely:\n$$\n\\nabla_{e_{i}}\\psi = e_{i}(\\psi) + \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} (0) c(e_{j})c(e_{k})\\psi = e_{i}(\\psi)\n$$\nThe term $e_{i}(\\psi)$ is the action of the vector field $e_{i} = \\partial_{x_{i}}$ on the spinor field $\\psi$. Since we are working in global coordinates $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ and the spinor bundle is trivial, $\\psi$ can be viewed as a function $\\psi(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ whose values are vectors in the spinor representation space. The action of $e_{i}$ is simply the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x_{i}$:\n$$\ne_{i}(\\psi) = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{i}}\n$$\nThus, the spinor covariant derivative simplifies to the ordinary partial derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla_{e_{i}}\\psi = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{i}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this simplified expression back into the original definition of the Dirac operator:\n$$\nD\\psi = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(e_{i}) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThe final step is to use the provided identification of the Clifford multiplication endomorphisms $c(e_{i})$ with a fixed representation by constant matrices $\\gamma_{i}$.

We are given the tautological exact sequence of complex vector bundles over $M$:\n$$0 \\to S \\to \\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^{3} \\to Q \\to 0$$\nwhere $S = \\mathcal{O}(-1)$ is the tautological line bundle, $\\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}$ is the trivial rank-$3$ complex vector bundle, and $Q$ is the universal quotient bundle of rank $2$.\n\nThe Whitney sum formula for Chern classes states that for a short exact sequence of vector bundles $0 \\to E' \\to E \\to E'' \\to 0$, the total Chern class satisfies $c(E) = c(E')c(E'')$. Applying this to our sequence:\n$$c(\\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}) = c(S) c(Q)$$\nThe total Chern class of a trivial bundle is $1$. Therefore, $c(\\underline{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}) = 1$. This implies:\n$$c(Q) = c(S)^{-1}$$\nThe bundle $S$ is the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(-1)$. Its dual is $S^{*} = \\mathcal{O}(1)$. The problem states that the first Chern class of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ generates $H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, and we denote it by $H = c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1))$. The first Chern class of the dual bundle is the negative of the original bundle's first Chern class:\n$$c_{1}(S) = c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(-1)) = -c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = -H$$\nSince $S$ is a line bundle (rank $1$), its total Chern class is $c(S) = 1 + c_{1}(S) = 1 - H$.\n\nThe cohomology ring of $\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ is $H^{*}(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[H]/\\langle H^{3} \\rangle$. We can now compute the total Chern class of $Q$:\n$$c(Q) = (1 - H)^{-1} = 1 + H + H^{2} + H^{3} + \\dots$$\nIn the ring $H^{*}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, where $H^{3}=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$c(Q) = 1 + H + H^{2}$$\nFrom this, we extract the individual Chern classes of $Q$:\n$c_{1}(Q) = H$\n$c_{2}(Q) = H^{2}$\n\nThe holomorphic tangent bundle $T^{1,0}M$ of $\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ is isomorphic to the tensor product bundle $S^{*} \\otimes Q$:\n$$T^{1,0}M \\cong S^{*} \\otimes Q$$\nThe first Chern class of a tensor product of two vector bundles $E$ and $F$ is given by the formula:\n$$c_{1}(E \\otimes F) = \\mathrm{rank}(F)c_{1}(E) + \\mathrm{rank}(E)c_{1}(F)$$\nFor $T^{1,0}M \\cong S^{*} \\otimes Q$, we have $E=S^{*}$ and $F=Q$. Their ranks are $\\mathrm{rank}(S^{*}) = 1$ and $\\mathrm{rank}(Q) = 2$. Their first Chern classes are $c_{1}(S^{*}) = H$ and $c_{1}(Q) = H$.\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n$$c_{1}(T^{1,0}M) = \\mathrm{rank}(Q)c_{1}(S^{*}) + \\mathrm{rank}(S^{*})c_{1}(Q) = 2 \\cdot H + 1 \\cdot H = 3H$$\n\n**Step 2: Determination of $w_{2}(TM)$**\n\nThe tangent bundle $TM$ of an almost complex manifold $M$ is the real vector bundle underlying the holomorphic tangent bundle $T^{1,0}M$. The Stiefel-Whitney classes of $TM$ are related to the Chern classes of $T^{1,0}M$. For an almost complex vector bundle $E$, the second Stiefel-Whitney class of its underlying real bundle $E_{\\mathbb{R}}$ is the reduction modulo $2$ of its first Chern class:\n$$w_{2}(E_{\\mathbb{R}}) = c_{1}(E) \\pmod{2}$$\nApplying this to $E = T^{1,0}M$, we get:\n$$w_{2}(TM) = c_{1}(T^{1,0}M) \\pmod{2}$$\nSubstituting the result from Step 1:\n$$w_{2}(TM) = (3H) \\pmod{2}$$\nLet $\\bar{H} \\in H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ be the image of $H \\in H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ under the reduction homomorphism $\\rho: H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$. Since $H$ generates $H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\bar{H}$ generates $H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Thus, $\\bar{H} \\neq 0$.\nIn $H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$, the coefficient $3$ is reduced modulo $2$: $3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Therefore:\n$$w_{2}(TM) = 1 \\cdot \\bar{H} = \\bar{H}$$\n\n**Step 3: Spin Structure and Its Implications**\n\nA smooth manifold $M$ admits a spin structure if and only if its second Stiefel-Whitney class, $w_{2}(TM)$, is zero.\nFrom Step 2, we found that $w_{2}(TM) = \\bar{H} \\neq 0$ because $\\bar{H}$ is the generator of the non-trivial group $H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ does not admit a spin structure.\n\nThe implications are as follows:\n- **Existence of the Dirac Operator**: The untwisted Dirac operator, $D$, is defined on the spinor bundle of a Riemannian manifold. The existence of a spinor bundle is equivalent to the existence of a spin structure. Since $\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ is not a spin manifold, it does not possess a spinor bundle. Consequently, the untwisted Dirac operator does not exist on $\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$.\n- **Harmonic Spinors and the Lichnerowicz Formula**: Harmonic spinors are sections $\\psi$ of the spinor bundle that lie in the kernel of the Dirac operator, $D\\psi = 0$. The Lichnerowicz formula for a spin manifold is $D^{2} = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla + \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Scal}$, where $\\nabla$ is the connection on the spinor bundle and $\\mathrm{Scal}$ is the scalar curvature. On a compact spin manifold endowed with a metric of positive scalar curvature ($\\mathrm{Scal} > 0$), this formula implies that the only harmonic spinor is the zero spinor. $\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ with its standard Fubini-Study metric has positive scalar curvature. However, the Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem is not applicable, as the prerequisite of being a spin manifold is not met. The reason for the absence of non-trivial harmonic spinors on $\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ is more fundamental: the space of spinors itself is not defined, so the space of harmonic spinors is trivially the zero vector space.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nWe need to compute the value of $\\langle w_{2}(TM),[\\mathbb{C}P^{1}]\\rangle \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This is the evaluation of the cohomology class $w_{2}(TM) \\in H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ on the homology class represented by $[\\mathbb{C}P^{1}]$. Since $w_{2}(TM)$ is a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-class, the evaluation takes values in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. We shall evaluate it on the homology class $[\\mathbb{C}P^{1}]_{2} \\in H_{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ corresponding to $[\\mathbb{C}P^{1}] \\in H_{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe evaluation pairing is compatible with coefficient homomorphisms. This means we can use the given integer pairing and reduce the result modulo $2$:\n$$\\langle w_{2}(TM),[\\mathbb{C}P^{1}]_{2} \\rangle = \\langle \\bar{H}, [\\mathbb{C}P^{1}]_{2} \\rangle = (\\langle H, [\\mathbb{C}P^{1}] \\rangle) \\pmod{2}$$\nThe problem states that $\\langle H,[\\mathbb{C}P^{1}]\\rangle=1$.\nTherefore:\n$$\\langle w_{2}(TM),[\\mathbb{C}P^{1}]\\rangle = 1 \\pmod{2} = 1$$\nThe value of the pairing is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2995193"}, {"introduction": "A key to the Dirac operator's power is its special behavior under conformal changes of the metric.
