All provided information is scientifically sound and internally consistent.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three stages as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the curvature $2$-form $\\Omega$, the Gaussian curvature $K$, and the area form $dA$. Let $M$ be the specified surface. We consider a local oriented orthonormal coframe $\\{\\theta^{1}, \\theta^{2}\\}$ on an open subset of $M$. The Riemannian metric is locally given by $g = (\\theta^{1})^{2} + (\\theta^{2})^{2}$, and the corresponding Riemannian area form is $dA = \\theta^{1} \\wedge \\theta^{2}$. The Levi-Civita connection on the tangent bundle $TM$ is described by a matrix-valued $1$-form $\\omega = (\\omega^{i}_{j})$ taking values in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$. This means $\\omega^{j}_{i} = -\\omega^{i}_{j}$ and $\\omega^{i}_{i} = 0$. We can write the connection matrix in terms of a single real-valued $1$-form, $\\omega_{12} \\equiv \\omega^{2}_{1}$, as:\n$$\n\\omega = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\omega_{12} \\\\ \\omega_{12} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe condition that the connection is torsion-free, expressed by the first Cartan structure equation $d\\theta + \\omega \\wedge \\theta = 0$, yields the component equations $d\\theta^{1} = \\omega_{12} \\wedge \\theta^{2}$ and $d\\theta^{2} = -\\omega_{12} \\wedge \\theta^{1}$. The curvature $2$-form matrix, $\\Omega_{\\text{matrix}} = (\\Omega^{i}_{j})$, is defined by the second Cartan structure equation, $\\Omega_{\\text{matrix}} = d\\omega + \\omega \\wedge \\omega$. The components are $\\Omega^{i}_{j} = d\\omega^{i}_{j} + \\sum_{k} \\omega^{i}_{k} \\wedge \\omega^{k}_{j}$. Calculating the $(1,2)$ component gives:\n$$\n\\Omega^{1}_{2} = d\\omega^{1}_{2} + \\omega^{1}_{1} \\wedge \\omega^{1}_{2} + \\omega^{1}_{2} \\wedge \\omega^{2}_{2} = d(-\\omega_{12}) = -d\\omega_{12}\n$$\nThe curvature form is related to the Riemann curvature tensor by $\\Omega^{i}_{j} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k,l}R^{i}_{jkl}\\theta^{k}\\wedge\\theta^{l}$. The Gaussian curvature $K$ is defined in this frame by $K = R^{1}_{212}$. Expanding $\\Omega^{1}_{2}$ gives:\n$$\n\\Omega^{1}_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(R^{1}_{212}\\theta^{1}\\wedge\\theta^{2} + R^{1}_{221}\\theta^{2}\\wedge\\theta^{1}) = R^{1}_{212}\\theta^{1}\\wedge\\theta^{2} = K(\\theta^{1}\\wedge\\theta^{2})\n$$\nFollowing the problem's convention, we identify the scalar curvature $2$-form $\\Omega$ with the component $\\Omega^{1}_{2}$. Thus, we have the expression:\n$$\n\\Omega = K \\, dA\n$$\n\nSecond, we address the connection to the Euler class $e(TM)$ and the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$. In the Chern-Weil theory for an oriented, rank-$2k$ real vector bundle, the Euler class is represented in de Rham cohomology by the differential form $\\mathrm{Pf}(\\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{matrix}}}{2\\pi})$, where $\\mathrm{Pf}$ denotes the Pfaffian. For the tangent bundle $TM$ of a surface, the rank is $2$, so $k=1$, and the structure group is $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$. The full curvature matrix is:\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\text{matrix}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\Omega^{1}_{2} \\\\ \\Omega^{2}_{1} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & K\\,dA \\\\ -K\\,dA & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\Omega \\\\ -\\Omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Pfaffian of the normalized matrix is simply its $(1,2)$ component:\n$$\ne(TM) \\equiv \\mathrm{Pf}\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{matrix}}}{2\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{\\Omega}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe general Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of this Euler class representative over the closed manifold $M$ equals the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$, which is a topological invariant. Thus, we have the foundational equation:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\frac{\\Omega}{2\\pi} = \\chi(M)\n$$\n\nThird, we combine the previous results to find the explicit expression for the integral of the Gaussian curvature. Substituting $\\Omega = K \\, dA$ into the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet formula, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\frac{K \\, dA}{2\\pi} = \\chi(M)\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the desired integral gives:\n$$\n\\int_{M} K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(M)\n$$\nFor a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, the Euler characteristic is given by the well-known formula $\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g$. Substituting this into our equation yields the final expression for the integral purely in terms of the genus $g$:\n$$\n\\int_{M} K \\, dA = 2\\pi (2 - 2g) = 4\\pi(1 - g)\n$$\nThis result verifies the theorem for the given hyperbolic metric, as it demonstrates that the integral of a geometric quantity (curvature) over the entire surface depends only on a global topological property (genus). The given condition $g \\geq 2$ ensures that for $K=-1$, the surface has a positive area, $\\mathrm{Area}(M) = 4\\pi(g-1) > 0$, which is consistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi(1 - g)}$$", "id": "2993555"}, {"introduction": "After exploring the two-dimensional case, we now test the robustness of the general Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem in higher dimensions with a foundational example: the flat torus $T^{2m}$.

Consequently, the geometric side of the theorem, $\\int_M E(\\Omega)$, evaluates to zero, perfectly matching the independently computed topological invariant $\\chi(T^{2m}) = 0$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is parsed and validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in differential geometry and algebraic topology, with all necessary information provided and no internal contradictions.\n\nThe problem investigates the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a specific case: a $2m$-dimensional flat torus, denoted $T^{2m}$. The manifold is defined as the quotient $T^{2m} = \\mathbb{R}^{2m}/\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{2m}$. The Riemannian metric on $T^{2m}$ is the one induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2m}$, which we denote as $g$. This inherited metric is flat, meaning its Riemann curvature tensor is zero. We are asked to derive this and related consequences from first principles.\n\nFirst, we address the curvature of $T^{2m}$. The problem specifies using a global orthonormal frame on $T^{2m}$ that arises from parallel vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{2m}$. Let $(x^1, \\dots, x^{2m})$ be the standard Cartesian coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^{2m}$. The vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2m}}\\}$ constitute an orthonormal frame with respect to the Euclidean metric. For this metric, the Christoffel symbols are all zero, which implies that these vector fields are parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{2m}$; that is, $\\nabla^{\\mathbb{R}^{2m}}_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = 0$ for all $i,j$. These vector fields are invariant under translations, so they descend to well-defined, globally defined vector fields $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_{2m}\\}$ on the quotient $T^{2m}$. Since the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{2m} \\to T^{2m}$ is a local isometry, the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on $T^{2m}$ is locally identical to that on $\\mathbb{R}^{2m}$. Consequently, the frame fields $\\{e_j\\}$ are parallel on $T^{2m}$, meaning $\\nabla_X e_j = 0$ for any vector field $X$ and for all $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 2m\\}$. It follows that $\\nabla e_j = 0$. This frame is also globally orthonormal.\n\nThe connection $1$-forms $(\\omega^i_j)$ relative to this frame are defined by the equation $\\nabla e_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{2m} \\omega^i_j \\otimes e_i$. Since $\\nabla e_j = 0$ for all $j$, we must have $\\omega^i_j = 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 2m\\}$.\nThe curvature $2$-form matrix $\\Omega = (\\Omega^i_j)$ is given by the second Cartan structural equation: $\\Omega = d\\omega + \\omega \\wedge \\omega$. In components, $\\Omega^i_j = d\\omega^i_j + \\sum_{k=1}^{2m} \\omega^i_k \\wedge \\omega^k_j$. As all connection $1$-forms $\\omega^i_j$ are identically zero, their exterior derivatives $d\\omega^i_j$ are also zero, and so are the wedge products. Thus, we conclude from first principles that $\\Omega^i_j = 0$ for all $i,j$. The curvature $2$-form $\\Omega$ is identically zero on $T^{2m}$.\n\nNext, we compute the integral of the Euler form. The Euler form $E(\\Omega)$ is defined as $E(\\Omega) = (2\\pi)^{-m}\\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega)$, where $\\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega)$ is the Pfaffian of the curvature matrix $\\Omega$. The Pfaffian is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $m$ in the entries of the $2m \\times 2m$ skew-symmetric matrix $\\Omega$. Since we have shown that $\\Omega$ is the zero matrix of $2$-forms, every entry $\\Omega^i_j$ is the zero $2$-form. Consequently, any polynomial in these entries, including the Pfaffian, must be zero. So, $\\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega) = 0$.\nThe Euler form is therefore identically zero: $E(\\Omega) = (2\\pi)^{-m} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThe integral of an identically zero differential form over the manifold $T^{2m}$ is necessarily zero:\n$$\n\\int_{T^{2m}} E(\\Omega) = \\int_{T^{2m}} 0 = 0\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(T^{2m})$ independently. Topologically, the $2m$-torus is the product of $2m$ circles: $T^{2m} \\cong \\prod_{i=1}^{2m} S^1$. The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant that is multiplicative with respect to products of spaces, i.e., $\\chi(X \\times Y) = \\chi(X) \\chi(Y)$.\nThe Euler characteristic of a single circle, $S^1$, can be computed from its Betti numbers, $b_k(S^1)$. For $S^1$, we have $b_0(S^1)=1$ and $b_1(S^1)=1$, and all other Betti numbers are zero. The Euler characteristic is the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(S^1) = b_0(S^1) - b_1(S^1) = 1-1=0$.\nApplying the multiplicative property, we find the Euler characteristic of the $2m$-torus:\n$$\n\\chi(T^{2m}) = \\chi\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{2m} S^1\\right) = \\left(\\chi(S^1)\\right)^{2m} = 0^{2m}\n$$\nFor any integer $m \\ge 1$, this value is $0$.\n\nAlternatively, using the Künneth theorem, the Betti numbers of $T^{2m}$ are given by $b_k(T^{2m}) = \\binom{2m}{k}$. The Euler characteristic is then:\n$$\n\\chi(T^{2m}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2m} (-1)^k b_k(T^{2m}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2m} (-1)^k \\binom{2m}{k}\n$$\nBy the binomial theorem, this sum is equal to $(1-1)^{2m} = 0^{2m} = 0$ for $m \\ge 1$.\n\nIn comparing these results, we have computed the geometric quantity $\\int_{T^{2m}} E(\\Omega) = 0$ and the topological invariant $\\chi(T^{2m}) = 0$. The generalized Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact, oriented, $2m$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, these two quantities must be equal. Our calculation confirms this theorem for the flat torus, as $0 = 0$.
