The sequence becomes:\n$$0 \\to \\mathcal{O} \\to \\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus 3} \\to T^{1,0}M \\to 0$$\nOne of the foundational inputs is the multiplicativity of total Chern classes under Whitney sum. For a short exact sequence of vector bundles $0 \\to E' \\to E \\to E'' \\to 0$, the Whitney sum property implies that the total Chern class of the middle bundle is the product of the total Chern classes of the outer bundles: $c(E) = c(E') c(E'')$.\n\nApplying this to our sequence, we get:\n$$c(\\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus 3}) = c(\\mathcal{O}) c(T^{1,0}M)$$\nThe total Chern class of the trivial line bundle $\\mathcal{O}$ is $c(\\mathcal{O}) = 1$. The total Chern class of a direct sum (Whitney sum) of bundles is the product of their individual total Chern classes.

The problem states that $c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = x$, where $x$ is the positive generator of $H^{2}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$.
