We will proceed by directly applying the definitions of comass and calibration.\n\nFirst, we determine the comass of $\\omega_k$. The comass of a $k$-form $\\omega$ on a Riemannian manifold, denoted $\\|\\omega\\|^*$, is defined as the supremum of its evaluation on all possible orthonormal $k$-frames in the tangent spaces. As both the metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ and the form $\\omega_k$ are constant on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we can perform the calculation at any point, for instance the origin. The definition is:\n$$\n\\|\\omega_{k}\\|^* = \\sup \\left\\{ \\omega_{k}(v_1, \\dots, v_k) \\mid \\{v_1, \\dots, v_k\\} \\text{ is an orthonormal set of vectors in } \\mathbb{R}^n \\right\\}\n$$\nNote that some definitions use the supremum of the absolute value, $|\\omega_{k}(v_1, \\dots, v_k)|$. However, since we can always reverse the orientation of the frame $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_k\\}$ by, for example, replacing $v_1$ with $-v_1$, which changes the sign of the evaluation, the supremum of the value and the supremum of its absolute value coincide.\n\nLet $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_k\\}$ be an arbitrary orthonormal set of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let each vector $v_j$ for $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,k\\}$ be represented by its components in the standard basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ as $v_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n v_j^i e_i$. By definition, the action of the simple $k$-form $\\omega_k = \\mathrm{d}x^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k$ on this set of vectors is given by the determinant of a matrix whose entries are the actions of the $1$-forms $\\mathrm{d}x^i$ on the vectors $v_j$:\n$$\n\\omega_{k}(v_1, \\dots, v_k) = \\det \\left( \\mathrm{d}x^i(v_j) \\right)_{i,j=1,\\dots,k}\n$$\nSince $\\{\\mathrm{d}x^1, \\dots, \\mathrm{d}x^n\\}$ is the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$, we have $\\mathrm{d}x^i(v_j) = \\mathrm{d}x^i\\left(\\sum_{l=1}^n v_j^l e_l\\right) = v_j^i$. The evaluation thus becomes:\n$$\n\\omega_{k}(v_1, \\dots, v_k) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\nv_1^1 & v_2^1 & \\cdots & v_k^1 \\\\\nv_1^2 & v_2^2 & \\cdots & v_k^2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nv_1^k & v_2^k & \\cdots & v_k^k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis value has a direct geometric interpretation. The quantity $\\omega_{k}(v_1, \\dots, v_k)$ is the signed $k$-dimensional volume of the orthogonal projection of the parallelepiped spanned by $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_k\\}$ onto the coordinate $k$-plane spanned by $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_k\\}$.\n\nThe set of vectors $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_k\\}$ is orthonormal. This means the parallelepiped they span is a unit $k$-hypercube lying in the $k$-dimensional subspace spanned by these vectors. Its $k$-dimensional volume is exactly $1$.\n\nThe volume of an orthogonal projection of a body is always less than or equal to the volume of the original body. Therefore, the absolute value of the projected volume cannot exceed the original volume, which is $1$. This gives us the inequality:\n$$\n|\\omega_{k}(v_1, \\dots, v_k)| \\le 1\n$$\nfor any orthonormal $k$-frame $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_k\\}$. This implies that the comass $\\|\\omega_k\\|^*$ is less than or equal to $1$.\n\nTo show that the comass is exactly $1$, we must show that this bound is attained. Consider the specific orthonormal set of vectors $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_k\\}$. This is a valid choice of an orthonormal $k$-frame since $k \\le n$. For this choice, we have $v_j = e_j$ for $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$. The components are $v_j^i = \\delta_j^i$, where $\\delta_j^i$ is the Kronecker delta. The evaluation gives:\n$$\n\\omega_{k}(e_1, \\dots, e_k) = \\det \\left( \\mathrm{d}x^i(e_j) \\right)_{i,j=1,\\dots,k} = \\det(\\delta_{ij})_{i,j=1,\\dots,k} = \\det(I_k) = 1\n$$\nwhere $I_k$ is the $k \\times k$ identity matrix.\nSince we have found an orthonormal $k$-frame for which the evaluation of $\\omega_k$ is $1$, and we have shown that the evaluation cannot exceed $1$, the supremum must be $1$.\nThus, the comass of $\\omega_k$ is:\n$$\n\\|\\omega_{k}\\|^* = 1\n$$\n\nNext, we determine for which $k$ (with $1 \\le k \\le n$) the form $\\omega_k$ is a calibration. A $k$-form $\\omega$ on a Riemannian manifold is defined as a calibration if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  It is a closed form, i.e., $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$.\n2.  For any point $p$ and any oriented tangent $k$-plane $\\xi \\subset T_p M$, the evaluation of $\\omega$ on $\\xi$ is less than or equal to the volume of $\\xi$, i.e., $\\omega|_\\xi \\le \\mathrm{dVol}_\\xi$. This condition is equivalent to stating that its comass is equal to $1$, $\\|\\omega\\|^*=1$. Some definitions use $\\|\\omega\\|^* \\le 1$, but the standard definition in calibrated geometry requires equality to ensure the existence of calibrated submanifolds.\n\nWe check these two conditions for $\\omega_k = \\mathrm{d}x^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k$.\n1.  **Closedness:** The form $\\omega_k$ has constant coefficients (the coefficient for the basis form $\\mathrm{d}x^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k$ is $1$, and all others are $0$). The exterior derivative of a form with constant coefficients is always zero. Formally:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{d}\\omega_k = \\mathrm{d}(1 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}x^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k) = (\\mathrm{d}1) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k = 0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k = 0\n    $$\n    Alternatively, using the property $\\mathrm{d}^2 = 0$, we have $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x^i) = 0$ for all coordinate functions $x^i$. Applying the graded Leibniz rule for $\\mathrm{d}$:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{d}\\omega_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i-1} \\mathrm{d}x^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x^i) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k = \\sum_{i=1}^k 0 = 0\n    $$\n    Thus, $\\omega_k$ is a closed form for any $k$.\n\n2.  **Comass condition:** As derived above, we found that $\\|\\omega_k\\|^* = 1$ for all $k$ in the range $1 \\le k \\le n$.\n\nSince $\\omega_k$ is closed and its comass is $1$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le n$, it is a calibration for all these values of $k$.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit value for the comass of $\\omega_k$. This value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2969648"}, {"introduction": "The power of calibrated geometry lies in its connection to volume minimization, a cornerstone of the theory established by Harvey and Lawson.

The tangent vectors $v_k$ correspond to vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ having $e^{i\\alpha_k}$ in the $k$-th position and $0$ elsewhere.\n$$\ng_{kl} = g(v_k, v_l) = \\mathrm{Re}\\langle (0, \\dots, e^{i\\alpha_k}, \\dots, 0), (0, \\dots, e^{i\\alpha_l}, \\dots, 0) \\rangle = \\mathrm{Re}(e^{i\\alpha_k} \\overline{e^{i\\alpha_l}} \\delta_{kl}) = \\mathrm{Re}(e^{i(\\alpha_k - \\alpha_l)} \\delta_{kl}).\n$$\nIf $k \\neq l$, $g_{kl}=0$. If $k=l$, $g_{kk} = \\mathrm{Re}(e^0) = 1$. Therefore, $g_{kl} = \\delta_{kl}$.\nThe induced metric is the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $g_L = \\sum_{k=1}^n du_k \\otimes du_k$. The volume form is $\\mathrm{vol}_{L} = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{kl})} du_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge du_n = \\sqrt{1} \\, du_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge du_n = du_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge du_n$.\nComparing the two forms, we have\n$$\ne^{i\\theta} \\mathrm{vol}_{L} = \\exp\\left(i \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j\\right) \\mathrm{vol}_{L}.\n$$\nThis implies $e^{i\\theta} = \\exp\\left(i \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j\\right)$, from which we conclude that the Lagrangian angle is $\\theta = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j$.\n\n4. Since the parameters $\\alpha_j$ are constants, their sum $\\theta = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j$ is also a constant. By definition, a Lagrangian submanifold with a constant Lagrangian angle is a special Lagrangian submanifold. Therefore, $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is special Lagrangian with phase $\\varphi = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j$.\n\n3. To analyze the properties of $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ under Lagrangian mean curvature flow (LMCF), we compute its mean curvature vector $H$. As shown by the parametrization $x_j=u_j \\cos\\alpha_j, y_j=u_j \\sin\\alpha_j$, $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is an $n$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. A linear subspace is a totally geodesic submanifold of Euclidean space. This means its second fundamental form $B$ is identically zero.\nWe can verify this from first principles. The second fundamental form is given by the normal component of the second derivatives of the parametrization map $F$: $B(v_k, v_l) = \\left(\\nabla_{v_k} v_l\\right)^\\perp$. In Euclidean space with Cartesian coordinates, the covariant derivative $\\nabla$ is just the partial derivative of the component functions. The tangent vectors are $v_k = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u_k}$, which are constant vectors. Thus, $\\nabla_{v_k} v_l = \\frac{\\partial v_l}{\\partial u_k} = \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial u_k \\partial u_l} = 0$.\nSince the second fundamental form $B$ is zero, its trace, the mean curvature vector $H = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_L}(B) = \\sum_{k=1}^n B(v_k, v_k)$, is also identically zero.\nA submanifold with $H \\equiv 0$ is called minimal. For LMCF, the velocity is the mean curvature vector, so if $H \\equiv 0$, the submanifold is a stationary solution. Thus, $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is a stationary solution to LMCF.\nNow we check if it is a self-similar shrinker, which satisfies the condition $H = -\\frac{1}{2}X^{\\perp}$. Since $H=0$, this condition becomes $X^{\\perp}=0$. The vector $X$ is the position vector from the origin to a point $p \\in L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$, so $X(p) = p$. The vector $X^{\\perp}$ is the component of $X$ normal to the tangent space $T_p L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$.\nSince $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is a linear subspace, for any point $p \\in L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$, the tangent space $T_p L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$, when viewed as a vector subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, is identical to $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ itself. The position vector $X(p)=p$ is in $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ by definition. Therefore, $X(p)$ is in $T_p L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$. This means the tangential component $X^{\\top}$ is $X$ itself, and the normal component $X^{\\perp}$ is zero.\nThe shrinker condition $H = -\\frac{1}{2}X^{\\perp}$ becomes $0 = -\\frac{1}{2}(0)$, which is true. Hence, $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is also a (trivial) self-similar shrinker solution to LMCF.\n\nIn conclusion, $L_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is a minimal special Lagrangian submanifold and is a stationary solution (and a trivial self-similar shrinker) to LMCF. The Lagrangian angle, which is also its special Lagrangian phase, is the sum of the rotation angles in each complex plane.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\alpha_{j}}\n$$", "id": "2969670"}]}
