We will proceed to solve it by direct application of the provided definitions.\n\nThe complex manifold is a torus $X = \\mathbb{C}^{n} / \\Lambda$. The problem provides the flat Kähler form $\\omega_{0}$ on $X$, which is induced from the standard Hermitian metric on its universal cover $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. In the global linear holomorphic coordinates $z^{1},\\dots,z^{n}$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, this form is given by:\n$$\n\\omega_{0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dz^{i} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{i}\n$$\nA general Kähler form $\\omega$ is expressed in local holomorphic coordinates in terms of the components of its associated Kähler metric tensor $g_{i\\bar{j}}$ as:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} g_{i\\bar{j}} dz^{i} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}\n$$\nBy comparing the specific expression for $\\omega_{0}$ with the general one, we identify the components of its metric tensor. We can rewrite the sum for $\\omega_{0}$ using the Kronecker delta symbol, $\\delta_{ij}$, which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise:\n$$\n\\omega_{0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\delta_{ij} dz^{i} \\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}\n$$\nThis comparison reveals that the components of the metric tensor for $\\omega_{0}$ are $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\delta_{ij}$. The matrix of these coefficients, $(g_{i\\bar{j}})$, is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_{n}$. As correctly stated in the problem, these coefficients are constant functions on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\n\nThe first task is to compute the Ricci form, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})$. The definition provided is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega) = - \\sqrt{-1} \\,\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})\n$$\nWe apply this formula to our metric $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\delta_{ij}$.\nFirst, we compute the determinant of the metric tensor matrix:\n$$\n\\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}) = \\det(I_{n}) = 1\n$$\nNext, we take the logarithm of this determinant:\n$$\n\\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}) = \\log(1) = 0\n$$\nThe result is the constant function $0$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Now, we apply the Dolbeault operators $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$. For any constant function $c$, its derivatives are zero. Therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} (\\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})) = \\bar{\\partial}(0) = 0\n$$\nAnd subsequently:\n$$\n\\partial \\bar{\\partial} (\\log \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})) = \\partial(0) = 0\n$$\nThe resulting (1,1)-form is the zero form. Substituting this into the definition of the Ricci form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = - \\sqrt{-1} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Ricci form of the flat Kähler metric on the torus is the zero $2$-form.\n\nThe calculation was performed in the global coordinates of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Since the metric coefficients $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant everywhere on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, the result $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = 0$ is valid globally on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Both the metric form $\\omega_{0}$ and its Ricci form $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})=0$ are invariant under translations $z \\mapsto z + \\lambda$ for $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$. Therefore, they descend to well-defined global forms on the quotient space $X = \\mathbb{C}^{n} / \\Lambda$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})$ vanishes globally on the torus $X$. A Kähler manifold with a vanishing Ricci form is known as a Calabi-Yau manifold (or Ricci-flat Kähler manifold), and the flat torus is a fundamental example.\n\nThe second task is to justify that the solution to the unnormalized Kähler-Ricci flow, $\\partial_{t}\\omega(t) = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t))$, with initial data $\\omega(0) = \\omega_{0}$, is stationary.\nAt time $t=0$, the flow equation is:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\omega(t)|_{t=0} = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(0)) = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0})\n$$\nUsing our previously computed result, $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = 0$, we find:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\omega(t)|_{t=0} = 0\n$$\nThis indicates that the initial \"velocity\" of the form is zero. Let us test the hypothesis that the solution is stationary, i.e., $\\omega(t) = \\omega_{0}$ for all time $t \\geq 0$.\nFor this proposed solution, the left-hand side of the flow equation is the time derivative of a constant form:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\omega(t) = \\partial_{t}(\\omega_{0}) = 0\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the flow equation for this solution is:\n$$\n- \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) = - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{0}) = 0\n$$\nSince both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation equal zero, the proposed stationary solution $\\omega(t) = \\omega_{0}$ is a valid solution. By the short-time existence and uniqueness theorem for the Kähler-Ricci flow, this is the unique solution for the given initial condition. Thus, the flat metric on the torus is a fixed point of the Kähler-Ricci flow; it does not evolve in time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3035762"}, {"introduction": "After seeing a concrete example of a Ricci-flat metric, we now explore the profound topological consequences of the Calabi-Yau condition.

We will derive the nine Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ for $p,q \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ using the following established principles for such manifolds.\n\n1.  **Connectivity and $h^{0,0}$**: For any connected compact complex manifold, the zeroth Betti number is $b_0=1$. The Hodge decomposition of the zeroth cohomology group is trivial, $H^0(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong H^{0,0}(X)$, so the corresponding Hodge number is $h^{0,0} = b_0 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Hodge Symmetry**: For any compact Kähler manifold, complex conjugation on differential forms induces an isomorphism $\\overline{H^{p,q}(X)} \\cong H^{q,p}(X)$. This implies the equality of Hodge numbers: $h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}$.\n\n3.  **Serre Duality for Calabi-Yau Manifolds**: For a compact complex manifold of dimension $n$ with a trivial canonical bundle, Serre duality provides the relation $h^{p,q} = h^{n-p, n-q}$. For a K3 surface, $n=2$, so we have $h^{p,q} = h^{2-p, 2-q}$.\n\n4.  **Hodge Decomposition of Betti Numbers**: The Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^k(X, \\mathbb{C})$ are related to the Hodge numbers via the sum $b_k = \\sum_{p+q=k} h^{p,q}$.\n\nWe now proceed with the calculation, using the givens: $n=2$, $b_1=0$, $b_2=22$, and $h^{2,0}=1$.\n\n-   **Calculation of $h^{0,0}$ and $h^{2,2}$**:\n    As established in principle $1$, since a K3 surface is connected, we have $h^{0,0} = 1$.\n    Using Serre duality (principle $3$) with $n=2$:\n    $$h^{2,2} = h^{2-2, 2-2} = h^{0,0}$$\n    Therefore, $h^{2,2} = 1$.\n\n-   **Calculation of $h^{2,0}$ and $h^{0,2}$**:\n    We are given $h^{2,0} = 1$.\n    Using Hodge symmetry (principle $2$):\n    $$h^{0,2} = h^{2,0}$$\n    Therefore, $h^{0,2} = 1$. This is consistent with Serre duality, which also gives $h^{0,2} = h^{2-0, 2-2} = h^{2,0} = 1$.\n\n-   **Calculation of $h^{1,0}$ and $h^{0,1}$**:\n    From the Hodge decomposition of $b_1$ (principle $4$):\n    $$b_1 = h^{1,0} + h^{0,1}$$\n    Using Hodge symmetry, we know $h^{1,0} = h^{0,1}$, so $b_1 = 2h^{1,0}$.\n    We are given $b_1=0$.
