In local holomorphic coordinates $\\{z^j\\}$, the Hermitian metric is specified by the components $g_{j\\bar{k}} = g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^j}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^k})$. The problem states that these components are the entries of a constant positive-definite Hermitian matrix $H$, so $g_{j\\bar{k}} = H_{j\\bar{k}}$.\n\nThe fundamental $2$-form $\\omega$ associated with the Hermitian metric $g$ is a real $(1,1)$-form. Its definition is $\\omega(X,Y) = g_R(JX, Y)$, where $g_R$ is the associated Riemannian metric, which is the real part of the Hermitian metric. In local holomorphic coordinates, this form is given by the standard expression:\n$$\n\\omega = i \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} g_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}\n$$\nIn our case, the components $g_{j\\bar{k}} = H_{j\\bar{k}}$ are constants. Substituting this into the expression for $\\omega$ gives:\n$$\n\\omega = i \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}\n$$\nTo show that this metric is Kähler, we must demonstrate that $\\omega$ is a closed form, i.e., its exterior derivative $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ is zero. We compute the exterior derivative:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d} \\left( i \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k} \\right)\n$$\nSince the exterior derivative is a linear operator and the components $H_{j\\bar{k}}$ are constants, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = i \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k})\n$$\nUsing the product rule for the exterior derivative (Leibniz rule), we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}) = (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j})) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k} - \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}))\n$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that $\\mathrm{d}^2 = 0$. The coordinate functions $z^j$ and $\\bar{z}^k$ are $0$-forms. Their derivatives, $\\mathrm{d}z^j$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^k$, are $1$-forms. Applying the exterior derivative again yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j}) = \\mathrm{d}^2 z^{j} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}) = \\mathrm{d}^2 \\bar{z}^{k} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back, we find:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}) = 0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k} - \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = i \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$, the form $\\omega$ is closed. A Hermitian metric whose fundamental $2$-form is closed is, by definition, a Kähler metric. Thus, the given metric $g$ together with the complex structure $J$ defines a Kähler structure on $\\mathbb{C}^n$.\n\nPart 2: Compute the Ricci form $\\rho$.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of the Ricci form $\\rho$ of a Kähler metric in local holomorphic coordinates as:\n$$\n\\rho = -i \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log(\\det(g_{j\\bar{k}}))\n$$\nwhere $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$ are the Dolbeault operators.

Let $G$ be the matrix with these components. Then the determinant, $\\det(G) = \\det(H_{j\\bar{k}})$, is the determinant of a constant matrix.

Let's denote this constant by $C$.\n$$\nC = \\det(g_{j\\bar{k}})\n$$\nSince $H$ is a positive-definite Hermitian matrix, its determinant $C$ is a positive real constant.\n\nWe now evaluate the function inside the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$ operator:\n$$\nf(z^1, \\dots, z^n) = \\log(\\det(g_{j\\bar{k}})) = \\log(C)\n$$\nThis function $f$ is a constant function on $\\mathbb{C}^n$.

The metric $g$ is described as \"flat\". A flat metric possesses a vanishing Riemann curvature tensor. The Christoffel symbols for this metric, calculated in the global coordinate system $\\{z^j\\}$, are $\\Gamma^p_{jk} = g^{p\\bar{q}} \\frac{\\partial g_{j\\bar{q}}}{\\partial z^k}$. Since the metric components $g_{j\\bar{q}}=H_{j\\bar{q}}$ are constants, their derivatives are zero, which implies that all Christoffel symbols vanish. The components of the Riemann curvature tensor are expressions involving the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives. If all $\\Gamma^p_{jk}$ are zero, the Riemann tensor is identically zero.\n\nThe Ricci curvature tensor, $R_{j\\bar{k}}$, is a contraction of the Riemann tensor. Therefore, if the Riemann tensor is zero, the Ricci tensor must also be zero. For a Kähler metric, the components of the Ricci tensor are related to the potential function $\\log(\\det(g_{p\\bar{q}}))$ by $R_{j\\bar{k}} = -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^j \\partial \\bar{z}^k} \\log(\\det(g_{p\\bar{q}}))$. Our calculation confirms that $R_{j\\bar{k}}=0$ for all $j,k$. The Ricci form $\\rho$ is constructed from the Ricci tensor components as $\\rho = i \\sum_{j,k} R_{j\\bar{k}} \\mathrm{d}z^j \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^k$. A vanishing Ricci tensor thus directly implies a vanishing Ricci form, $\\rho=0$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a thorough understanding of the hierarchy of geometric structures on a manifold: Riemannian, Hermitian, Kähler, and Symplectic. Let's summarize the relationships based on the provided, correct definitions.\n\nA **Hermitian manifold** $(M, J, g)$ is a complex manifold $(M, J)$ equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ that is compatible with $J$, meaning $g(JX, JY) = g(X,Y)$. From $g$ and $J$, one defines the fundamental $2$-form $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y)$. This form is always non-degenerate because $g$ is non-degenerate.\n\nA **Kähler manifold** is a Hermitian manifold $(M, J, g)$ whose fundamental form $\\omega$ is also closed, i.e., $d\\omega = 0$.\n\nA **symplectic manifold** $(M, \\omega')$ is a manifold equipped with a closed ($d\\omega'=0$) and non-degenerate $2$-form $\\omega'$.\n\nFrom these definitions, any Kähler manifold $(M, J, g)$ is automatically a symplectic manifold with the symplectic form being its fundamental form $\\omega$. It is also by definition a Hermitian manifold. The question asks for an example of a manifold that is Hermitian but not Kähler. The existence of a Hermitian metric on any complex manifold is guaranteed; one can take any Riemannian metric $g_0$ and define a new metric $g(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(g_0(X,Y) + g_0(JX,JY))$, which is an J-compatible Riemannian metric. Thus, the real challenge is to find a compact complex manifold $(M,J)$ that does not admit *any* Kähler metric.\n\nA key property of compact Kähler manifolds provides a topological obstruction to their existence. Let $(M, J, g)$ be a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension $n$. Its Kähler form $\\omega$ is a closed $2$-form, so it defines a de Rham cohomology class $[\\omega] \\in H^2(M, \\mathbb{R})$. This class is non-trivial. Furthermore, the $n$-th exterior power of the Kähler form, $\\omega^n = \\omega \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\omega$ ($n$ times), is a volume form on $M$. This means $\\int_M \\omega^n > 0$.\n\nNow, consider a compact complex manifold $M$ whose second Betti number is zero, $b_2(M) = \\dim H^2(M, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. If $M$ were to admit a Kähler metric, its Kähler form $\\omega$ would be closed, $d\\omega=0$. Since $H^2(M, \\mathbb{R})=0$, any closed $2$-form is exact. Thus, there must exist a $1$-form $\\eta$ such that $\\omega = d\\eta$.\nUsing this, we can compute the volume of $M$ with respect to the would-be volume form $\\omega^n$:\nSince $d\\omega = 0$, we have $d(\\eta \\wedge \\omega^{n-1}) = d\\eta \\wedge \\omega^{n-1} - \\eta \\wedge d(\\omega^{n-1}) = \\omega \\wedge \\omega^{n-1} - \\eta \\wedge ( (n-1)\\omega^{n-2} \\wedge d\\omega) = \\omega^n$.\nSo, $\\omega^n = d(\\eta \\wedge \\omega^{n-1})$. By Stokes' theorem, the integral of an exact form over a compact manifold without boundary is zero:\n$$ \\int_M \\omega^n = \\int_M d(\\eta \\wedge \\omega^{n-1}) = \\int_{\\partial M} \\eta \\wedge \\omega^{n-1} $$\nSince $M$ is compact, its boundary $\\partial M$ is the empty set, so $\\int_{\\partial M} (\\cdot) = 0$. This leads to $\\int_M \\omega^n = 0$, which contradicts the fact that $\\omega^n$ is a volume form and must have a positive integral.\nTherefore, a compact complex manifold $M$ with $H^2(M, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ cannot admit any Kähler metric.\n\nWe now analyze each option.\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Definitions**: The definitions given for Hermitian, symplectic, and Kähler structures are all correct and match the standard ones provided in the problem statement.\n- **Example**: The Hopf manifold $H = (\\mathbb{C}^n \\setminus \\{0\\})/\\langle z \\mapsto \\lambda z \\rangle$ for $n \\ge 2$ and $|\\lambda| > 1$ is a standard example of a compact complex manifold. As a complex manifold, it admits a Hermitian metric.\n- **Reasoning**: The manifold $H$ is diffeomorphic to $S^{2n-1} \\times S^1$. Using the Künneth theorem for de Rham cohomology, $H^k(M \\times N) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^p(M) \\otimes H^q(N)$. For $H^2(S^{2n-1} \\times S^1, \\mathbb{R})$, we consider pairs $(p,q)$ with $p+q=2$. The cohomology groups of the spheres are $H^p(S^m, \\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$ for $p=0, m$ and $0$ otherwise.\n    - $p=2, q=0$: $H^2(S^{2n-1}, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H^0(S^1, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\otimes \\mathbb{R} = 0$ (since $n \\ge 2 \\implies 2n-1 \\ge 3 \\neq 2$).\n    - $p=1, q=1$: $H^1(S^{2n-1}, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H^1(S^1, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\otimes \\mathbb{R} = 0$ (since $2n-1 \\ge 3 \\neq 1$).\n    - $p=0, q=2$: $H^0(S^{2n-1}, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H^2(S^1, \\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R} \\otimes 0 = 0$.\nSumming these up, $H^2(H, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. The remainder of the reasoning follows the exact logic derived above: a hypothetical Kähler form $\\omega$ would be exact, leading to $\\int_H \\omega^n=0$ by Stokes' theorem, which contradicts $\\omega^n$ being a volume form. All parts of this option are correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Definitions**: The definitions are incorrect.\n    - `any Riemannian metric $g$ automatically makes $(M,J,g)$ Hermitian` is false. The compatibility condition $g(JX,JY)=g(X,Y)$ is not automatically satisfied.\n    - `A symplectic structure is any nondegenerate $2$-form` is false. It omits the crucial condition $d\\omega=0$.\n    - `A Kähler structure is any Hermitian structure` is false. It omits the condition that the fundamental form is closed, which is the defining difference.\n- **Example**: The example and reasoning are incorrect. A complex torus $T^{2n} = \\mathbb{C}^n/\\Lambda$ equipped with the flat metric inherited from $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is a primary example of a compact Kähler manifold, not a non-Kähler one. The fundamental form $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^n dz_j \\wedge d\\bar{z}_j$ has constant coefficients and is therefore closed.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n- **Definitions**: The definitions are incorrect.\n    - `A Hermitian metric ... satisfies $g(JX,JY) = -g(X,Y)$` is false; the correct relation is $g(JX,JY) = g(X,Y)$.\n    - `A symplectic structure is any closed $2$-form` is false. It omits the non-degeneracy condition.\n    - `A Kähler structure is a Hermitian structure such that the associated fundamental form is exact` is false. The condition is that the form is *closed* ($d\\omega=0$), not necessarily exact. On a compact manifold with $H^2 \\neq 0$, a Kähler form is closed but not exact.\n- **Example**: The example is problematic. It is a famous open problem whether the six-sphere $S^6$ admits an integrable complex structure. It is known to possess an *almost* complex structure compatible with the round metric, making it an *almost* Hermitian manifold. But since it is not known to be a complex manifold, it cannot serve as a definite example in this context. The question asks for a compact *complex* manifold.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n- **Definitions**: The definitions are incorrect.\n    - The condition for a Kähler form $\\omega$ is $d\\omega=0$. On a complex manifold, $d=\\partial+\\bar\\partial$. For a real $(1,1)$-form $\\omega$, the condition $d\\omega=0$ is equivalent to the pair of conditions $\\partial\\omega=0$ and $\\bar\\partial\\omega=0$. Stating that only $\\partial\\omega=0$ is needed is incorrect.\n    - `Any symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$ admits a compatible integrable complex structure $J$ globally` is false. While any symplectic manifold admits compatible *almost* complex structures, the integrability of any of these is a strong additional condition which is often not met. There are known examples of compact symplectic manifolds that do not admit any compatible complex structure (and thus cannot be Kähler).\n- **Example**: The example and reasoning are incorrect. $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is not compact, which violates a premise of the search for a counterexample that typically relies on compactness (e.g., via Stokes' theorem or Hodge theory). Furthermore, $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with its standard metric *is* a Kähler manifold; its fundamental form $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2}\\sum_j dz_j \\wedge d\\bar{z}_j$ has constant coefficients and is closed.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that presents correct definitions, a valid example, and a sound mathematical justification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2988843"}]}
