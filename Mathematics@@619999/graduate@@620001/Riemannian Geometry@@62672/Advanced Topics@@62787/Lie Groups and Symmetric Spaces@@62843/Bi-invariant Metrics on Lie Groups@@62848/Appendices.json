For any two elements $g, h \\in G$, we can apply left-invariance with the element $h$ and right-invariance with the element $h^{-1}$:\n$$\nd(g, e) = d(h g, h e) = d(h g, h)\n$$\nAnd using right-invariance on the result:\n$$\nd(h g, h) = d(h g h^{-1}, h h^{-1}) = d(h g h^{-1}, e)\n$$\nCombining these, we get $d(g, e) = d(h g h^{-1}, e)$. This means that the distance of any group element from the identity element must be the same for all elements within the same conjugation class.\n\nLet's compute the conjugation operation in $G$. Let an element be $g = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and another element be $h = \\begin{pmatrix} c & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.

The upper-left entry, $a$, is an invariant of the conjugation class. The upper-right entry, $b$, can be changed.\n\nLet's examine the subgroup of translations, which corresponds to $a=1$. Consider the element $g_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its distance from the identity is $K = d(g_1, e)$.\nThe conjugate of $g_1$ by $h = \\begin{pmatrix} c & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (with $c \\neq 0$) is:\n$$\nh g_1 h^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & c(1) + d(1-1) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & c \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAccording to our bi-invariance condition, $d(h g_1 h^{-1}, e) = d(g_1, e) = K$.\nThis implies that for any $c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the element $g_c = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & c \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ must have the same distance $K$ from the identity:\n$$\nd\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & c \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = K \\quad \\text{for all } c \\neq 0\n$$\nThe problem states that the metric is assumed to induce the standard topology of the group manifold. In this topology, which is equivalent to the subspace topology from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ via the mapping $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (a,b)$, the metric $d$ must be a continuous function.\nLet's consider the limit as $c \\to 0$. By continuity of the metric:\n$$\n\\lim_{c \\to 0} d\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & c \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, e\\right) = d\\left(\\lim_{c \\to 0} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & c \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, e\\right)\n$$\nThe limit of the matrix is the identity matrix $e$:\n$$\n\\lim_{c \\to 0} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & c \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = e\n$$\nSo, the limit of the distance is $d(e, e) = 0$.\nHowever, we found that the distance is a constant $K$ for all $c \\neq 0$. The only way for a constant value to have a limit of 0 is if the constant itself is 0. Thus, we must have $K=0$.\nIf $K=0$, then $d(g_1, e) = d\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, e\\right) = 0$.\nBy the identity of indiscernibles axiom of a metric, $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$. This implies that $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = e = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is a contradiction since $1 \\neq 0$.\nTherefore, our initial assumption that a bi-invariant metric exists must be false.\n\nThe reason for this failure is the structure of the conjugation classes: for the subgroup of translations (where $a=1$), the conjugation action by scaling elements (where $c \\neq 1$) can connect any non-identity translation to any other non-identity translation, forcing their distances to the identity to be equal. Continuity then forces this distance to be zero, which is a contradiction. This matches statement E.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other options:\n- C is incorrect.

A non-abelian group can have a bi-invariant metric.

Local isometries preserve local geometric quantities like the sectional curvature.
