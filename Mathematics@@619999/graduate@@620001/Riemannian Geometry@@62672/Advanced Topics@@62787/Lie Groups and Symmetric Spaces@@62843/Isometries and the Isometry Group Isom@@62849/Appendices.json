It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all terms are formally defined. I will proceed with the solution by addressing each of the four parts and then calculating the final required value.\n\n**1. The differential $dF_x$ as an orthogonal isomorphism**\n\nLet $F: (\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta) \\to (\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$ be an isometry. By definition, $F$ is a diffeomorphism that preserves the metric, meaning $F^*\\delta = \\delta$. The standard Euclidean metric $\\delta$ at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bilinear form $\\delta_p: T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\times T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We can identify the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\mathbb{R}^n$ itself. In standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$, the metric tensor has components $\\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ (the Kronecker delta). For any two tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_x\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$, the inner product is $\\delta_x(u, v) = u^\\mathsf{T}v$.\n\nThe pullback condition $F^*\\delta = \\delta$ means that for any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and any pair of tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_x\\mathbb{R}^n$, we have:\n$$ (F^*\\delta)_x(u, v) = \\delta_x(u, v) $$\nBy the definition of the pullback, $(F^*\\delta)_x(u, v) = \\delta_{F(x)}(dF_x(u), dF_x(v))$, where $dF_x: T_x\\mathbb{R}^n \\to T_{F(x)}\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the differential (or pushforward) of $F$ at $x$.\n\nLet the matrix representation of the linear map $dF_x$ with respect to the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ be denoted by the same symbol, $dF_x$. Then the vectors $dF_x(u)$ and $dF_x(v)$ are just the matrix-vector products $(dF_x)u$ and $(dF_x)v$. The metric evaluation is the standard dot product. The isometry condition thus becomes:\n$$ u^\\mathsf{T}v = \\delta_x(u, v) = \\delta_{F(x)}((dF_x)u, (dF_x)v) = ((dF_x)u)^\\mathsf{T}((dF_x)v) = u^\\mathsf{T}(dF_x)^\\mathsf{T}(dF_x)v $$\nSince this equation must hold for all vectors $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, it implies that the matrix $(dF_x)^\\mathsf{T}(dF_x)$ must be the identity matrix $I$.\n$$ (dF_x)^\\mathsf{T}(dF_x) = I $$\nThis is the definition of an orthogonal matrix. Thus, the differential $dF_x$ is an orthogonal linear map for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Any orthogonal map is an isomorphism, since its determinant is $\\pm 1 \\neq 0$, which guarantees invertibility.\n\n**2. Isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are affine maps**\n\nWe are given that an isometry preserves the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. This means that for any vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we have $F_*(\\nabla_X Y) = \\nabla_{F_*X} (F_*Y)$, where $F_*X$ denotes the pushforward of the vector field $X$ by $F$. We are also given that the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ of the Euclidean connection vanish in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nLet $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ be Cartesian coordinates on the domain and $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$ be Cartesian coordinates on the codomain. Let $y = F(x)$. The fact that $F$ preserves the connection means that the Christoffel symbols of the connection expressed in the $y$ coordinate system must be the same as in the $x$ system, i.e., they must also vanish. The transformation law for Christoffel symbols under a coordinate change $x \\to y(x)$ is:\n$$ \\Gamma'_{ab}{}^c(y) = \\sum_{i,j,k} \\frac{\\partial y^c}{\\partial x^i}(x) \\frac{\\partial x^j}{\\partial y^a}(y) \\frac{\\partial x^k}{\\partial y^b}(y) \\Gamma_{jk}{}^i(x) + \\sum_{i,k} \\frac{\\partial y^c}{\\partial x^i}(x) \\frac{\\partial^2 x^i}{\\partial y^a \\partial y^b}(y) $$\nIn our case, $\\Gamma_{jk}{}^i(x) = 0$ because they are the symbols for the Euclidean metric in Cartesian coordinates. Since $F$ is an isometry, the connection form is preserved, so the symbols in the new coordinates must also be zero: $\\Gamma'_{ab}{}^c(y) = 0$. This simplifies the transformation law to:\n$$ 0 = \\sum_{i,k} \\frac{\\partial y^c}{\\partial x^i}(x) \\frac{\\partial^2 x^i}{\\partial y^a \\partial y^b}(y) $$\nLet $G = F^{-1}$, so $x^i = G^i(y)$. The term $\\frac{\\partial y^c}{\\partial x^i}$ represents the entries of the Jacobian matrix of $F$, which is invertible. Therefore, for the sum to be zero, we must have that the coefficients of each $\\frac{\\partial y^c}{\\partial x^i}$ are zero. This means for all $i, a, b$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 x^i}{\\partial y^a \\partial y^b}(y) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 G^i}{\\partial y^a \\partial y^b}(y) = 0 $$\nThis indicates that all second-order partial derivatives of the component functions of $G = F^{-1}$ are zero. This implies that $G$ must be an affine map. That is, there exists a constant matrix $B$ and a constant vector $c$ such that $G(y) = By + c$.\nSince $G$ is the inverse of an isometry, it is also an isometry. From part 1, its differential $dG_y = B$ must be an element of the orthogonal group $O(n)$.\nNow we find $F = G^{-1}$. From $x = By + c$, we solve for $y$:\n$$ y = B^{-1}(x - c) = B^{-1}x - B^{-1}c $$\nSo, $F(x) = B^{-1}x - B^{-1}c$. Let $A = B^{-1}$ and $b = -B^{-1}c$. Since $B \\in O(n)$, its inverse $A = B^{-1} = B^\\mathsf{T}$ is also in $O(n)$. The vector $b$ is a constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Therefore, any isometry $F$ of Euclidean space must have the form:\n$$ F(x) = Ax + b $$\nwhere $A \\in O(n)$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The differential $dF_x$ is the constant matrix $A$, which is independent of $x$.\n\n**3. The Isometry Group as a Semidirect Product**\n\nFrom part 2, every isometry $F$ is uniquely determined by a pair $(b, A)$ where $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $A \\in O(n)$, via the map $F(x) = Ax+b$. This establishes a bijection between $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$ and the set $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times O(n)$. The group operation in $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$ is composition of functions. Let's find the corresponding operation on the pairs $(b, A)$.\n\nLet $F_1(x) = A_1 x + b_1$ and $F_2(x) = A_2 x + b_2$ be two isometries, corresponding to pairs $(b_1, A_1)$ and $(b_2, A_2)$. Their composition is:\n$$ (F_1 \\circ F_2)(x) = F_1(F_2(x)) = A_1(A_2 x + b_2) + b_1 = (A_1 A_2) x + (A_1 b_2 + b_1) $$\nThe resulting isometry corresponds to the pair $(b_1 + A_1 b_2, A_1 A_2)$. Thus, the group law on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times O(n)$ is:\n$$ (b_1, A_1) \\cdot (b_2, A_2) = (b_1 + A_1 b_2, A_1 A_2) $$\nThis is the group law for the semidirect product $\\mathbb{R}^n \\rtimes_\\psi O(n)$, where $\\psi: O(n) \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a homomorphism defining the action of $O(n)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a group under vector addition, and $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cong GL(n, \\mathbb{R})$. The action is given by $\\psi(A)(b) = Ab$, the standard matrix-vector multiplication. This is a valid homomorphism from $O(n)$ to $GL(n, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$ is isomorphic to the semidirect product $\\mathbb{R}^n \\rtimes O(n)$ with the group law given above.\n\n**4. The Lie Algebra $\\mathfrak{isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$**\n\nThe Lie algebra of a Lie group is the tangent space at the identity element. The identity element of $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$ is the identity map $F(x)=x$, which corresponds to the pair $(0, I)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n \\rtimes O(n)$.\nAs a vector space, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$ is the direct sum of the Lie algebras of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $O(n)$:\n$$ \\mathfrak{isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta) \\cong T_0\\mathbb{R}^n \\oplus T_I O(n) = \\mathbb{R}^n \\oplus \\mathfrak{so}(n) $$\nAn element of this algebra is a pair $(v, X)$ where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $X \\in \\mathfrak{so}(n)$.\nThe Lie bracket for a semidirect product of Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{h} \\rtimes_\\phi \\mathfrak{k}$ is given by:\n$$ [(h_1, k_1), (h_2, k_2)] = ([h_1, h_2]_\\mathfrak{h} + \\phi(k_1)(h_2) - \\phi(k_2)(h_1), [k_1, k_2]_\\mathfrak{k}) $$\nHere, $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the Lie algebra of the translation group $(\\mathbb{R}^n, +)$, which is abelian, so its bracket $[v, w]_{\\mathbb{R}^n} = 0$. $\\mathfrak{k}$ is $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$, whose bracket is the matrix commutator $[X,Y] = XY-YX$.\nThe action $\\phi$ of $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the derivative of the group action $\\psi(A)(b) = Ab$. For $X \\in \\mathfrak{so}(n)$, we have:\n$$ \\phi(X)(w) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\psi(\\exp(tX))(w) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\exp(tX)w) = Xw $$\nwhere $\\exp$ is the matrix exponential. The action is simply matrix multiplication.\nSubstituting these into the bracket formula with elements $(v, X)$ and $(w, Y)$:\n$$ [(v, X), (w, Y)] = (0 + \\phi(X)(w) - \\phi(Y)(v), [X, Y]) = (Xw - Yv, [X, Y]) $$\nThis matches the formula given in the problem statement.\n\n**Dimension of $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$**\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$ is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)$.\n$$ \\dim(\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)) = \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) + \\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(n)) $$\nWe have $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is the space of $n \\times n$ real skew-symmetric matrices. A matrix $X$ is skew-symmetric if $X^\\mathsf{T} = -X$. This implies that its diagonal entries are zero ($X_{ii} = 0$), and its off-diagonal entries satisfy $X_{ji} = -X_{ij}$. To define such a matrix, we only need to specify the entries above the main diagonal.\nThe number of entries in the upper triangle of an $n \\times n$ matrix (excluding the diagonal) is:\n$$ \\frac{n^2-n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$\nSo, $\\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(n)) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nThe total dimension is the sum:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta)) = n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{2n + n^2 - n}{2} = \\frac{n^2 + n}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$$", "id": "2981265"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a flat to a curved setting, we now examine the unit sphere $S^n$, the archetypal example of a space with constant positive curvature.

The Special Orthogonal group $SO(n+1)$ acts on $S^n$ by restricting linear maps in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to $S^n$. Starting from the core definitions of Riemannian isometries, geodesics, and the Levi-Civita connection (LCC), and without invoking classification theorems of constant-curvature spaces, derive that the group of orientation-preserving isometries of $S^n$ is precisely $SO(n+1)$ by showing that every such isometry is the restriction of a unique element of $SO(n+1)$.

No numerical approximation is required; do not include any units.", "solution": "The problem consists of two main parts. First, to derive that the group of orientation-preserving isometries of the $n$-sphere, $\\text{Isom}^+(S^n)$, is the special orthogonal group $SO(n+1)$. Second, to compute the Lie algebra of $SO(n+1)$.\n\nPart 1: Identification of $\\text{Isom}^+(S^n)$ with $SO(n+1)$\n\nLet $S^n$ be the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, defined by $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid \\langle x, x \\rangle = 1\\}$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the standard Euclidean inner product. The round Riemannian metric $g$ on $S^n$ is the metric induced by this inner product. An orientation-preserving Riemannian isometry is a diffeomorphism $f: S^n \\to S^n$ such that $f^*g = g$ and $f$ preserves the standard orientation of $S^n$.\n\nFirst, we establish that any element of $SO(n+1)$ gives rise to such an isometry. Let $A \\in SO(n+1)$. The map $f_A: S^n \\to S^n$ defined by $f_A(x) = Ax$ is well-defined because for $x \\in S^n$, we have $\\langle Ax, Ax \\rangle = (Ax)^T(Ax) = x^T A^T A x = x^T I x = \\langle x, x \\rangle = 1$, so $Ax \\in S^n$. The map is a diffeomorphism. The differential of $f_A$ at a point $p \\in S^n$ is the restriction of the linear map $A$ to the tangent space $T_p S^n$. Since $A$ is an orthogonal transformation of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, it preserves the inner product, and thus its restriction to $T_p S^n$ preserves the induced metric $g$. Hence, $f_A$ is an isometry. Since $A \\in SO(n+1)$, $\\det(A)=1$, which implies it preserves orientation. Therefore, $SO(n+1)$ can be considered a subgroup of $\\text{Isom}^+(S^n)$.\n\nThe core of the proof is to show the converse: every orientation-preserving isometry $f: S^n \\to S^n$ is the restriction of a unique element of $SO(n+1)$.\n\nLet $f: S^n \\to S^n$ be an orientation-preserving isometry. We will construct a linear map $F: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that extends $f$.\nLet $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_{n+1}\\}$ be the standard orthonormal basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let's choose a point $p_0 = e_{n+1} \\in S^n$. The tangent space $T_{p_0}S^n$ is the $n$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ orthogonal to $p_0$, which is spanned by $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$.\nLet $q_0 = f(p_0) \\in S^n$. The differential of $f$ at $p_0$, denoted $df_{p_0}: T_{p_0}S^n \\to T_{q_0}S^n$, is a linear isometry between these tangent spaces.\nWe define a linear map $F: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by specifying its action on the basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_{n+1}\\}$:\n1. Define $F(e_{n+1}) = q_0 = f(p_0)$.\n2. For $i=1, \\dots, n$, define $F(e_i) = df_{p_0}(e_i)$.\n\nWe now show that $F$ is an orthogonal transformation. This requires showing that $F$ maps the orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_{n+1}\\}$ to another orthonormal basis. The image of the basis is $\\{F(e_1), \\dots, F(e_n), F(e_{n+1})\\} = \\{df_{p_0}(e_1), \\dots, df_{p_0}(e_n), q_0\\}$.\n- Since $df_{p_0}$ is a linear isometry and $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_{p_0}S^n$, the set $\\{df_{p_0}(e_1), \\dots, df_{p_0}(e_n)\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_{q_0}S^n$. So, $\\langle df_{p_0}(e_i), df_{p_0}(e_j) \\rangle = \\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$.\n- The vectors $df_{p_0}(e_i)$ are in $T_{q_0}S^n$, which is the orthogonal complement of $q_0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Therefore, $\\langle df_{p_0}(e_i), q_0 \\rangle = 0$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n- Finally, $\\langle q_0, q_0 \\rangle = 1$ since $q_0 \\in S^n$.\nThis shows that $\\{df_{p_0}(e_1), \\dots, df_{p_0}(e_n), q_0\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. A linear transformation that maps an orthonormal basis to an orthonormal basis is an orthogonal transformation. Thus, $F \\in O(n+1)$.\n\nSince $f$ is orientation-preserving, the determinant of its differential $df_{p_0}$ viewed as a map between oriented tangent spaces is $+1$. The determinant of $F$ is given by the sign of the change of volume from the basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_{n+1}\\}$ to $\\{F(e_1), \\dots, F(e_{n+1})\\}$. Given the standard orientations, this change is positive, so $\\det(F)=1$. Hence, $F \\in SO(n+1)$.\n\nNext, we must show that $f(x) = F(x)$ for all $x \\in S^n$.\nA fundamental property of isometries is that they map geodesics to geodesics. This follows from the fact that an isometry preserves the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. A curve $\\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic if its acceleration vector field is zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. If $f$ is an isometry, then $f$ preserves the connection, meaning $f_*(\\nabla_X Y) = \\nabla_{f_*X} f_*Y$ for vector fields $X, Y$. Applying this to the geodesic equation, $\\nabla_{df(\\dot{\\gamma})}df(\\dot{\\gamma}) = f_*(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}) = f_*(0) = 0$. So, $f \\circ \\gamma$ is also a geodesic.\n\nThe geodesics on $S^n$ are great circles, which are of the form $\\gamma(t) = \\cos(t)p + \\sin(t)v$ for $p \\in S^n$ and a unit vector $v \\in T_pS^n$.\nAny point $x \\in S^n$ can be expressed as $x = \\cos(\\theta)p_0 + \\sin(\\theta)v$ for some $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ and a unit vector $v \\in T_{p_0}S^n$. This point $x$ lies on the geodesic $\\gamma(t) = \\cos(t)p_0 + \\sin(t)v$ at $t=\\theta$.\nLet us see how $f$ acts on $x$:\nThe curve $f \\circ \\gamma$ is a geodesic starting at $f(\\gamma(0)) = f(p_0) = q_0$ with initial velocity $(f \\circ \\gamma)'(0) = df_{p_0}(\\dot{\\gamma}(0)) = df_{p_0}(v)$.\nThe unique geodesic on $S^n$ starting at $q_0$ with initial velocity $df_{p_0}(v)$ is given by $\\eta(t) = \\cos(t)q_0 + \\sin(t)df_{p_0}(v)$.\nTherefore, $f(\\gamma(t)) = \\eta(t)$. For our point $x = \\gamma(\\theta)$, we have:\n$f(x) = f(\\gamma(\\theta)) = \\eta(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)q_0 + \\sin(\\theta)df_{p_0}(v)$.\n\nNow, let's compute $F(x)$ using the linearity of $F$:\n$F(x) = F(\\cos(\\theta)p_0 + \\sin(\\theta)v) = \\cos(\\theta)F(p_0) + \\sin(\\theta)F(v)$.\nBy our construction of $F$, $F(p_0) = F(e_{n+1}) = q_0$.\nThe vector $v \\in T_{p_0}S^n$ is a linear combination of $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$, i.e., $v = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i e_i$. By linearity of $F$ and its definition on the basis vectors:\n$F(v) = F(\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i F(e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i df_{p_0}(e_i)$.\nSince $df_{p_0}$ is itself a linear map, this is equal to $df_{p_0}(\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i e_i) = df_{p_0}(v)$.\nSubstituting back, we get:\n$F(x) = \\cos(\\theta)q_0 + \\sin(\\theta)df_{p_0}(v)$.\nComparing the expressions for $f(x)$ and $F(x)$, we see they are identical. Thus, $f(x) = F(x)$ for all $x \\in S^n$.\n\nFinally, we show this extension $F$ is unique. Suppose there is another map $G \\in SO(n+1)$ such that $G|_{S^n} = f$. Then $F(x) = G(x)$ for all $x \\in S^n$. Since $F$ and $G$ are linear maps, and they agree on the set $S^n$ which spans $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, they must agree on all of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ (if $v \\neq 0$) can be written as $v = \\|v\\| \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}$. Let $u = \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|} \\in S^n$. Then $F(v) = F(\\|v\\|u) = \\|v\\|F(u) = \\|v\\|G(u) = G(\\|v\\|u) = G(v)$. Hence $F=G$.\n\nThis establishes a bijection between $\\text{Isom}^+(S^n)$ and $SO(n+1)$. This bijection is a group homomorphism, and thus an isomorphism.\n\nPart 2: The Lie Algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n+1)$\n\nThe Lie group $SO(n+1)$ is defined as the set of real $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ matrices $A$ satisfying $A^T A = I_{n+1}$ and $\\det(A) = 1$, where $I_{n+1}$ is the identity matrix.\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n+1)$ is the tangent space to $SO(n+1)$ at the identity element. Its elements can be found by considering smooth curves $A(t)$ in $SO(n+1)$ such that $A(0) = I_{n+1}$. The elements of the Lie algebra are the derivatives $X = \\dot{A}(0)$.\n\nFor any such curve $A(t)$, the condition $A(t)^T A(t) = I_{n+1}$ holds for all $t$. We differentiate this equation with respect to $t$ using the product rule:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} (A(t)^T A(t)) = \\dot{A}(t)^T A(t) + A(t)^T \\dot{A}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(I_{n+1}) = 0 $$\nEvaluating at $t=0$, and recalling that $A(0)=I_{n+1}$ and $\\dot{A}(0)=X$:\n$$ X^T I_{n+1} + I_{n+1}^T X = 0 $$\n$$ X^T + X = 0 $$\nThis condition, $X^T = -X$, states that any element $X$ of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n+1)$ must be a skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nWe must also check the determinant condition. For any matrix $X$, the matrix exponential $\\exp(tX)$ is related to the determinant by Jacobi's formula: $\\det(\\exp(tX)) = \\exp(\\text{tr}(tX)) = \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{tr}(X))$. For $\\exp(tX)$ to be in $SO(n+1)$, we require $\\det(\\exp(tX))=1$. This means $\\exp(t \\cdot \\text{tr}(X)) = 1$ for all real $t$, which implies $\\text{tr}(X)=0$.\nFor a skew-symmetric matrix $X$, the diagonal elements are given by $X_{ii} = -X_{ii}$, which implies $2X_{ii}=0$, so $X_{ii}=0$. The trace of $X$ is the sum of its diagonal elements, $\\text{tr}(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} X_{ii} = 0$.\nThus, the skew-symmetry condition $X^T + X = 0$ is sufficient. It automatically ensures that $\\exp(tX)$ has determinant $1$ and lies in $SO(n+1)$ (the connected component of the identity in $O(n+1)$).\n\nTherefore, the Lie algebra of $SO(n+1)$ is the space of all $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ real skew-symmetric matrices.\nThe identity of the group $\\text{Isom}^+(S^n)$ is the identity map, which corresponds to the identity matrix $I_{n+1}$ in $SO(n+1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\text{Identity: } I_{n+1}, \\quad \\text{Lie Algebra: } \\{X \\in M_{n+1}(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid X^T + X = 0\\}}\n$$", "id": "2981263"}, {"introduction": "To complete our survey of constant curvature spaces, we turn to hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^n$, the fundamental model of negative curvature.

We must show that the map $\\phi_A: \\mathbb{H}^n \\to \\mathbb{H}^n$ defined by $\\phi_A(x) = Ax$ is an isometry.\nAn isometry of a Riemannian manifold is a diffeomorphism that preserves the Riemannian distance function.\nThe map $\\phi_A$ is the restriction of a linear map on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to the submanifold $\\mathbb{H}^n$. Since linear maps are smooth, $\\phi_A$ is smooth.\nBy definition of $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$, if $x \\in \\mathbb{H}^n$, then $Ax \\in \\mathbb{H}^n$. So $\\phi_A$ maps $\\mathbb{H}^n$ to itself.\nThe group $\\mathrm{O}(1,n)$ is a Lie group, and if $A \\in \\mathrm{O}(1,n)$, its inverse $A^{-1}$ is also in $\\mathrm{O}(1,n)$. If $A \\in \\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$, it provides a bijection of the upper sheet $\\mathbb{H}^n$ to itself, so its inverse map $A^{-1}$ must map $\\mathbb{H}^n$ to itself as well. Thus, $A^{-1} \\in \\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$. The inverse map $\\phi_{A^{-1}} = (\\phi_A)^{-1}$ is also smooth. Therefore, $\\phi_A$ is a diffeomorphism of $\\mathbb{H}^n$.\n\nNow we verify that $\\phi_A$ preserves the hyperbolic distance $d_{\\mathbb{H}^{n}}$. Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{H}^{n}$. The distance is given by the formula $\\cosh(d_{\\mathbb{H}^{n}}(x,y)) = -\\langle x,y\\rangle_{1,n}$.\nWe compute the hyperbolic distance between the images $Ax$ and $Ay$:\n$$\n\\cosh(d_{\\mathbb{H}^{n}}(Ax, Ay)) = -\\langle Ax, Ay \\rangle_{1,n}\n$$\nBy definition, any matrix $A \\in \\mathrm{O}(1,n)$ preserves the Minkowski bilinear form $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{1,n}$.

Since distance is always non-negative, $d_{\\mathbb{H}^n} \\ge 0$, we can conclude that the arguments must be equal:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{H}^{n}}(Ax, Ay) = d_{\\mathbb{H}^{n}}(x,y)\n$$\nSince $\\phi_A$ is a diffeomorphism that preserves the distance function, it is an isometry of $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$. This completes the proof for part 1.\n\n**Part 2: Transitivity and Stabilizer**\n\nFirst, we prove that the action of $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$ on $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$ is transitive. This means that for any two points $x, y \\in \\mathbb{H}^{n}$, there exists an element $A \\in \\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$ such that $Ax = y$. It is sufficient to show that for any point $x \\in \\mathbb{H}^{n}$, there exists an $A \\in \\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$ that maps the base point $p_0 = (1,0,\\dots,0) \\in \\mathbb{H}^{n}$ to $x$. If this holds, given $x, y \\in \\mathbb{H}^n$, we can find $A_x, A_y \\in \\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$ such that $A_x p_0 = x$ and $A_y p_0 = y$. Then the transformation $A = A_y (A_x)^{-1}$ satisfies $Ax = A_y (A_x)^{-1} x = A_y p_0 = y$.\n\nLet $x = (x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{H}^n$. We have $-x_0^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = -1$ and $x_0 > 0$. This implies $x_0 = \\sqrt{1 + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\ge 1$. Let $r = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}$. Then $x_0 = \\sqrt{1+r^2}$. We can find a parameter $\\alpha \\ge 0$ such that $x_0 = \\cosh(\\alpha)$ and $r=\\sinh(\\alpha)$. Let $\\vec{v} = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. If $r>0$, we can define a unit vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\hat{u} = \\vec{v}/r$. Then $x$ can be written as $(\\cosh(\\alpha), \\sinh(\\alpha)\\hat{u})$. If $r=0$, then $x_0=1$ and $x=p_0$.\n\nConsider a boost in the $x_1$-direction, given by the matrix:\n$$\nB(\\alpha) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\alpha) & \\sinh(\\alpha) & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\sinh(\\alpha) & \\cosh(\\alpha) & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is in $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$. Acting on $p_0$, we get $B(\\alpha)p_0 = (\\cosh(\\alpha), \\sinh(\\alpha), 0, \\dots, 0)^T$.\nNext, consider a spatial rotation. Let $R' \\in \\mathrm{O}(n)$ be an orthogonal transformation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The matrix\n$$\nR = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf{0}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & R' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nis in $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$. For any unit vector $\\hat{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a rotation $R' \\in \\mathrm{SO}(n) \\subset \\mathrm{O}(n)$ that maps the standard basis vector $e_1 = (1,0,\\dots,0)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\hat{u}$.\nLet $A = R B(\\alpha)$. As a product of elements in $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$, $A$ is also in $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$. We calculate its action on $p_0$:\n$$\nA p_0 = R(B(\\alpha) p_0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf{0}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & R' \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\alpha) \\\\ \\sinh(\\alpha) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\alpha) \\\\ R'(\\sinh(\\alpha), 0, \\dots)^T \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\alpha) \\\\ \\sinh(\\alpha) R'e_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\alpha) \\\\ \\sinh(\\alpha)\\hat{u} \\end{pmatrix} = x.\n$$\nThis construction produces any desired point $x \\in \\mathbb{H}^{n}$, so the action is transitive.\n\nNext, we determine the stabilizer of $p_0 = (1,0,\\dots,0)^T$. The stabilizer, or isotropy group, is $\\mathrm{Stab}(p_0) = \\{ A \\in \\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n) : Ap_0 = p_0 \\}$.\nLet $e_0, \\dots, e_n$ be the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Then $p_0 = e_0$. The condition $Ae_0 = e_0$ means that the first column of the matrix $A$ is $(1,0,\\dots,0)^T$.\nSo $A$ must have the block form:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf{a}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & A' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}^T$ is a $1 \\times n$ row vector and $A'$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. The condition $A \\in \\mathrm{O}(1,n)$ is $A^\\top J A = J$, where $J = \\mathrm{diag}(-1,1,\\dots,1)$.\n$$\nA^\\top J A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf{0}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{a} & (A')^\\top \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & \\mathbf{0}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & I_n \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf{a}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & A' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\mathbf{a}^T \\\\ -\\mathbf{a} & -\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{a}^T + (A')^\\top A' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor this to be equal to $J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & \\mathbf{0}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & I_n \\end{pmatrix}$, we must have:\n1. $-\\mathbf{a}^T = \\mathbf{0}^T \\implies \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n2. $(A')^\\top A' - \\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{a}^T = I_n$. With $\\mathbf{a}=\\mathbf{0}$, this becomes $(A')^\\top A' = I_n$.\nThe second condition means that $A'$ must be an orthogonal matrix, i.e., $A' \\in \\mathrm{O}(n)$.\nThus, the stabilizer of $p_0$ consists of all matrices of the form:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf{0}^T \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & A' \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A' \\in \\mathrm{O}(n).\n$$\nThis group is clearly isomorphic to the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(n)$, which is a compact Lie group.\n\n**Part 3: Isometry Group and Lie Algebra**\n\nThe Myers-Steenrod theorem states that the isometry group of any Riemannian manifold is a Lie group. A more specific theorem for symmetric spaces (of which $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is a prime example) states that every isometry of $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is the restriction of a transformation in $\\mathrm{O}(1,n)$ that preserves the sheet $\\mathbb{H}^n$. We have denoted this group $\\mathrm{O}^+(1,n)$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n) \\cong \\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$.\nFrom this isomorphism, we conclude:\n1. Since $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$ is a Lie group, $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)$ is a Lie group.\n2. From Part 2, the action of $\\mathrm{O}^{+}(1,n)$ on $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is transitive, so the action of $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)$ is transitive.\n3. The isotropy group of a point $p \\in \\mathbb{H}^n$ is the stabilizer $\\mathrm{Stab}(p)$. For $p_0$, this is $\\mathrm{Stab}(p_0) \\cong \\mathrm{O}(n)$, as found in Part 2.\n\nThe Lie algebra of a Lie group is the tangent space at the identity element. The group $\\mathrm{O}^+(1,n)$ is a union of connected components of the Lie group $\\mathrm{O}(1,n)$, and contains the identity. Therefore, its Lie algebra is the same as the Lie algebra of $\\mathrm{O}(1,n)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{o}(1,n)$.\nThe group $\\mathrm{O}(1,n)$ is defined by the condition $A^\\top J A = J$. To find the Lie algebra, we consider curves $A(t) = \\exp(tX)$ where $X$ is in the algebra. Differentiating the condition at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( (\\exp(tX))^\\top J (\\exp(tX)) \\right) \\Big|_{t=0} = \\frac{d}{dt} (J) \\Big|_{t=0} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left( (X^\\top \\exp(tX^\\top)) J \\exp(tX) + \\exp(tX^\\top) J (X \\exp(tX)) \\right) \\Big|_{t=0} = 0\n$$\nSetting $t=0$, we have $\\exp(0)=I$, which gives:\n$$\nX^\\top J I + I J X = 0 \\implies X^\\top J + JX = 0\n$$\nThis is the required characterization of the Lie algebra of $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)$.\n\n**Final Calculation: Dimension of $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)$**\n\nThe dimension of the isometry group is the dimension of its Lie algebra, $\\dim(\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{o}(1,n))$. We count the number of independent parameters in an $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ matrix $X$ satisfying $X^\\top J + JX = 0$.\nThe matrix equation is equivalent to $(X^\\top J)_{ik} + (JX)_{ik} = 0$. Using $(X^\\top)_{ik} = X_{ki}$, this is $\\sum_l X_{li} J_{lk} + \\sum_l J_{il} X_{lk} = 0$. Since $J$ is diagonal, this simplifies to $X_{ki}J_{kk} + J_{ii}X_{ik} = 0$ for all $i,k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}$.\n- If $i=k$, $2X_{ii}J_{ii} = 0$. Since $J_{ii}=\\pm 1$, this means $X_{ii}=0$ for all $i$. The diagonal entries are all zero.\n- If $i=0, k>0$: $X_{k0}J_{kk} + J_{00}X_{0k} = 0 \\implies X_{k0}(1) + (-1)X_{0k} = 0 \\implies X_{k0} = X_{0k}$. The first column and first row are related by symmetry (excluding the zero diagonal element). There are $n$ independent parameters $X_{01}, \\dots, X_{0n}$.\n- If $i,k > 0, i \\ne k$: $X_{ki}J_{kk} + J_{ii}X_{ik} = 0 \\implies X_{ki}(1) + (1)X_{ik} = 0 \\implies X_{ki} = -X_{ik}$. The submatrix for indices $1$ to $n$ is skew-symmetric. The number of independent parameters in an $n \\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix is the number of entries above the diagonal, which is $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of these independent parameters:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{o}(1,n)) = n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{2n + n^2 - n}{2} = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\nAlternatively, using the orbit-stabilizer theorem for Lie group actions:\n$\\dim(\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)) = \\dim(\\mathbb{H}^n) + \\dim(\\mathrm{Stab}(p_0))$.\nWe know $\\dim(\\mathbb{H}^n)=n$ and $\\mathrm{Stab}(p_0) \\cong \\mathrm{O}(n)$. The dimension of $\\mathrm{O}(n)$ is the dimension of its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{o}(n)$ (skew-symmetric $n \\times n$ matrices), which is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nSo, $\\dim(\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)) = n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\nThe final answer is this expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2981267"}]}
