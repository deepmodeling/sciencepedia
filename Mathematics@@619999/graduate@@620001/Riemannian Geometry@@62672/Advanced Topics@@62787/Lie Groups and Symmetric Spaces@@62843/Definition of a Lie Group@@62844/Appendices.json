It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and definitions to proceed. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. The task is to prove from first principles that the general linear group over the complex numbers, $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$, is a complex Lie group and to compute its real dimension.\n\nTo establish that $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is a complex Lie group, we must verify that it satisfies the three conditions from the provided definition:\n$1$. $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is a group.\n$2$. $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is a complex manifold.\n$3$. The group multiplication and inversion maps are holomorphic.\n\n**$1$. Group Structure of $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$**\n\nWe verify the group axioms for $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ under the operation of matrix multiplication. The set is defined as $GL(n,\\mathbb{C}) = \\{ A \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{C}) \\mid \\det(A) \\neq 0 \\}$.\n\n- **Closure:** Let $A, B \\in GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$. By definition, $\\det(A) \\neq 0$ and $\\det(B) \\neq 0$. The product of two complex numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, $\\det(A) \\det(B) \\neq 0$. Using the property of determinants, $\\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B)$, we have $\\det(AB) \\neq 0$. Therefore, the product $AB$ is in $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$.\n\n- **Associativity:** Matrix multiplication is associative. For any three matrices $A, B, C \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$, it holds that $(AB)C = A(BC)$. This property is inherited by the subset $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$.\n\n- **Identity Element:** The identity matrix $I_n$ has a determinant of $\\det(I_n) = 1$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, $I_n \\in GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$. For any $A \\in GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$, we have $A I_n = I_n A = A$, so $I_n$ is the identity element.\n\n- **Inverse Element:** For any $A \\in GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$, we have $\\det(A) \\neq 0$. This is precisely the condition for the matrix inverse $A^{-1}$ to exist in $M_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$. We must show that $A^{-1}$ is also in $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$. The determinant of the inverse is given by $\\det(A^{-1}) = (\\det(A))^{-1}$. Since $\\det(A)$ is a non-zero complex number, its multiplicative inverse is also non-zero. Thus, $\\det(A^{-1}) \\neq 0$, which implies $A^{-1} \\in GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nSince all group axioms are satisfied, $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\n**$2$. Complex Manifold Structure of $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$**\n\nThe problem states that the set of all $n \\times n$ complex matrices, $M_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$, is identified with the complex vector space $\\mathbb{C}^{n^{2}}$. As a complex vector space of finite dimension, $\\mathbb{C}^{n^{2}}$ is a complex manifold of complex dimension $n^2$.\n\nThe determinant map $\\det: M_n(\\mathbb{C}) \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function of the $n^2$ complex entries of a matrix. The formula for the determinant of a matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is given by the Leibniz formula:\n$$ \\det(A) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma(i)} $$\nThis expression is a polynomial in the matrix entries $a_{ij}$. The problem statement asserts that polynomial maps in complex coordinates are holomorphic. Therefore, the determinant map $\\det$ is a holomorphic function on $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nHolomorphic functions are continuous. The set $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is defined as the subset of $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ where the determinant is non-zero, which can be expressed as the preimage of the set $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ under the determinant map:\n$$ GL(n, \\mathbb{C}) = \\det^{-1}(\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}) $$\nThe set $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Since the determinant map is continuous, the preimage of this open set, $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$, must be an open subset of $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nAn open subset of a complex manifold is itself a complex manifold. Since $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is a complex manifold of dimension $n^2$, its open subset $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is also a complex manifold of the same complex dimension, $n^2$.\n\n**$3$. Holomorphicity of Group Operations**\n\n- **Multiplication:** The group multiplication is the map $\\mu: GL(n,\\mathbb{C}) \\times GL(n,\\mathbb{C}) \\to GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ given by $\\mu(A, B) = AB$. Let $A = (a_{ij})$ and $B = (b_{ij})$ be two matrices in $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$. The entries $(c_{ik})$ of their product $C = AB$ are given by:\n$$ c_{ik} = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}b_{jk} $$\nEach entry $c_{ik}$ is a polynomial in the entries of $A$ and $B$. As per the problem's premise, this implies that the multiplication map $\\mu$ is holomorphic.\n\n- **Inversion:** The group inversion is the map $\\iota: GL(n,\\mathbb{C}) \\to GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ given by $\\iota(A) = A^{-1}$. The inverse of a matrix $A$ can be computed using Cramer's rule:\n$$ A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\text{adj}(A) $$\nwhere $\\text{adj}(A)$ is the adjugate matrix of $A$. The entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $\\text{adj}(A)$ is the $(j,i)$-cofactor of $A$, which is a signed determinant of an $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ submatrix of $A$. Each entry of $\\text{adj}(A)$ is therefore a polynomial in the entries of $A$.\nThe function $\\det(A)$ is also a polynomial in the entries of $A$. Consequently, each entry of $A^{-1}$ is a ratio of two polynomials in the entries of $A$, with $\\det(A)$ as the denominator. Such a function is a rational function. On the domain $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$, the denominator $\\det(A)$ is, by definition, non-zero. A rational function is holomorphic on any open set where its denominator does not vanish. Thus, the inversion map $\\iota$ is holomorphic on $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nSince $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is a group, a complex manifold, and its group operations are holomorphic, it is a complex Lie group.\n\n**Computation of Real Dimension**\n\nWe have established that $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is an open subset of $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ and that $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is identified with $\\mathbb{C}^{n^2}$. The complex dimension of an open subset of a manifold is the same as the dimension of the ambient manifold. Therefore, the complex dimension of $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is equal to the complex dimension of $\\mathbb{C}^{n^2}$.\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} GL(n,\\mathbb{C}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathbb{C}^{n^2} = n^2 $$\nA complex manifold of complex dimension $k$ is, by its underlying structure, also a real manifold of real dimension $2k$. This is because each complex coordinate $z_j = x_j + i y_j$ corresponds to two real coordinates $(x_j, y_j)$. So, to specify a point in a $k$-dimensional complex space, one\nmust specify $2k$ real numbers.\n\nFor $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$, the complex dimension is $n^2$. Therefore, its real dimension is:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} GL(n,\\mathbb{C}) = 2 \\cdot \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} GL(n,\\mathbb{C}) = 2 n^2 $$\n\nThe real dimension of the Lie group $GL(n,\\mathbb{C})$ is $2n^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2n^{2}}$$", "id": "2973545"}, {"introduction": "A Lie group's infinitesimal structure is captured by its Lie algebra, but how is this algebraic data encoded in the group's manifold structure?

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of differential geometry and Lie theory, well-posed with a clear objective, and free of any\nambiguities or contradictions. All provided definitions and data are standard and self-consistent.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, we derive a general relation known as the Maurer-Cartan equation. Second, we apply this relation to the specific case of the three-dimensional Heisenberg group to compute its structure constants.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Maurer-Cartan Equation\n\nLet $G$ be a Lie group of dimension $n$. Let $\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$ be a basis of its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, realized as left-invariant vector fields on $G$. Let $\\{\\omega^{1},\\dots,\\omega^{n}\\}$ be the dual basis of left-invariant $1$-forms, defined by the condition $\\omega^{i}(X_{j}) = \\delta^{i}_{j}$, where $\\delta^{i}_{j}$ is the Kronecker delta. The structure constants of the Lie algebra are defined by the commutation relations of the basis vectors:\n$$\n[X_{i},X_{j}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n}c^{k}_{ij}X_{k}\n$$\nThe structure constants $c^{k}_{ij}$ are antisymmetric in their lower indices, $c^{k}_{ij} = -c^{k}_{ji}$, due to the antisymmetry of the Lie bracket, $[X_{i},X_{j}] = -[X_{j},X_{i}]$.\n\nTo find the relationship between the exterior derivatives $d\\omega^{k}$ and the structure constants $c^{k}_{ij}$, we use the general coordinate-free formula for the exterior derivative of a $1$-form $\\alpha$ applied to two vector fields $U$ and $V$:\n$$\nd\\alpha(U,V) = U(\\alpha(V)) - V(\\alpha(U)) - \\alpha([U,V])\n$$\nWe apply this formula to our left-invariant $1$-form $\\omega^k$ and the left-invariant basis vector fields $X_i$ and $X_j$.\n$$\nd\\omega^{k}(X_{i},X_{j}) = X_{i}(\\omega^{k}(X_{j})) - X_{j}(\\omega^{k}(X_{i})) - \\omega^{k}([X_{i},X_{j}])\n$$\nBy definition of the dual basis, $\\omega^{k}(X_{j}) = \\delta^{k}_{j}$ and $\\omega^{k}(X_{i}) = \\delta^{k}_{i}$. These are constants. The derivative of a constant function along any vector field is zero. Therefore, $X_{i}(\\delta^{k}_{j}) = 0$ and $X_{j}(\\delta^{k}_{i}) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nd\\omega^{k}(X_{i},X_{j}) = -\\omega^{k}([X_{i},X_{j}])\n$$\nNow, we substitute the definition of the structure constants:\n$$\nd\\omega^{k}(X_{i},X_{j}) = -\\omega^{k}\\left(\\sum_{l=1}^{n}c^{l}_{ij}X_{l}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\omega^k$ is a linear functional, we can write:\n$$\nd\\omega^{k}(X_{i},X_{j}) = -\\sum_{l=1}^{n}c^{l}_{ij}\\omega^{k}(X_{l})\n$$\nUsing the duality property $\\omega^{k}(X_{l}) = \\delta^{k}_{l}$ again, the sum collapses to the single term where $l=k$:\n$$\nd\\omega^{k}(X_{i},X_{j}) = -c^{k}_{ij}\n$$\nThis equation gives the components of the $2$-form $d\\omega^k$ with respect to the basis of vector fields $\\{X_i\\}$. We want to express $d\\omega^k$ in terms of the basis of $2$-forms $\\{\\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j\\}$. Any $2$-form $\\eta$ can be expanded as $\\eta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\eta_{ij} \\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j$, where the coefficients are given by $\\eta_{ij} = \\eta(X_i, X_j)$. For $\\eta = d\\omega^k$, the coefficients are $d\\omega^k(X_i, X_j) = -c^k_{ij}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nd\\omega^{k} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}\n$$\nThis is one of the Maurer-Cartan structure equations.\n\nThe problem asks to explain the numerical prefactor, which is $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The factor arises from conventions in summing over indices for exterior forms. We showed that $d\\omega^k(X_i, X_j) = -c^k_{ij}$. For $i<j$, the basis elements of $2$-forms are $\\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j$. The coefficient of $\\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j$ in the expansion of $d\\omega^k$ is $d\\omega^k(X_i, X_j) = -c^k_{ij}$. This gives the expansion over an ordered basis:\n$$\nd\\omega^k = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} d\\omega^k(X_i,X_j) \\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j = -\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} c^k_{ij} \\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j\n$$\nNow consider the unrestricted sum $\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}$. We can split this sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} = \\sum_{i<j} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} + \\sum_{j<i} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} + \\sum_{i=j} c^{k}_{ii}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{i}\n$$\nThe term with $i=j$ is zero because $\\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^i = 0$. In the second term, we swap the indices $i$ and $j$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j<i} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} = \\sum_{i<j} c^{k}_{ji}\\omega^{j}\\wedge\\omega^{i}\n$$\nUsing the antisymmetry of the structure constants ($c^k_{ji}=-c^k_{ij}$) and the wedge product ($\\omega^j \\wedge \\omega^i = -\\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j$):\n$$\nc^{k}_{ji}\\omega^{j}\\wedge\\omega^{i} = (-c^{k}_{ij})(-\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}) = c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}\n$$\nThus, the sum becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} = \\sum_{i<j} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} + \\sum_{i<j} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} = 2 \\sum_{i<j} c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}\n$$\nTherefore, $\\sum_{i<j} c^k_{ij} \\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} c^k_{ij} \\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j$. Substituting this into our expression for $d\\omega^k$:\n$$\nd\\omega^k = - \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j} c^k_{ij} \\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j}c^{k}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}\n$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a normalization constant that accounts for the double-counting of pairs of indices $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ when using an unrestricted sum, due to the inherent antisymmetry of both the structure constants and the wedge product.\n\n### Part 2: Application to the Heisenberg Group\n\nWe are given the left-invariant coframe on the Heisenberg group $H$:\n$$\n\\omega^{1}=dx, \\quad \\omega^{2}=dy, \\quad \\omega^{3}=dz - x\\,dy\n$$\nWe compute the exterior derivative of each $1$-form:\n1.  $d\\omega^{1} = d(dx) = 0$.\n2.  $d\\omega^{2} = d(dy) = 0$.\n3.  For $\\omega^3$, we use the properties of the exterior derivative: $d(f\\,dg) = df \\wedge dg + f\\,d(dg)$.\n    $$\n    d\\omega^{3} = d(dz - x\\,dy) = d(dz) - d(x\\,dy)\n    $$\n    Since $d(dz)=0$ and $d(dy)=0$, we have:\n    $$\n    d(x\\,dy) = (dx) \\wedge dy + x \\wedge d(dy) = dx \\wedge dy\n    $$\n    Therefore,\n    $$\n    d\\omega^{3} = -dx \\wedge dy\n    $$\nUsing the definitions $\\omega^1=dx$ and $\\omega^2=dy$, we can write this as:\n$$\nd\\omega^{3} = -\\omega^{1}\\wedge\\omega^{2}\n$$\nNow we compare these results with the Maurer-Cartan equation.\nFor $k=1$: $d\\omega^1 = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j}c^{1}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} = 0$. This implies all structure constants $c^1_{ij}$ are zero.\nFor $k=2$: $d\\omega^2 = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j}c^{2}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} = 0$. This implies all structure constants $c^2_{ij}$ are zero.\nFor $k=3$: $d\\omega^3 = -\\omega^1 \\wedge \\omega^2$. Comparing this with the general formula:\n$$\nd\\omega^3 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^{3}c^{3}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}\n$$\nSo, we must have:\n$$\n\\omega^{1}\\wedge\\omega^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^{3}c^{3}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j}\n$$\nExpanding the right-hand side and using $\\omega^i \\wedge \\omega^j = - \\omega^j \\wedge \\omega^i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^{3}c^{3}_{ij}\\omega^{i}\\wedge\\omega^{j} = (c^{3}_{12}-c^{3}_{21})\\omega^{1}\\wedge\\omega^{2} + (c^{3}_{13}-c^{3}_{31})\\omega^{1}\\wedge\\omega^{3} + (c^{3}_{23}-c^{3}_{32})\\omega^{2}\\wedge\\omega^{3}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n$$\n\\omega^{1}\\wedge\\omega^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(c^{3}_{12}-c^{3}_{21})\\omega^{1}\\wedge\\omega^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(c^{3}_{13}-c^{3}_{31})\\omega^{1}\\wedge\\omega^{3} + \\frac{1}{2}(c^{3}_{23}-c^{3}_{32})\\omega^{2}\\wedge\\omega^{3}\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis $2$-forms $\\{\\omega^1 \\wedge \\omega^2, \\omega^1 \\wedge \\omega^3, \\omega^2 \\wedge \\omega^3\\}$, we obtain a system of equations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $\\frac{1}{2}(c^{3}_{12}-c^{3}_{21}) = 1 \\implies c^{3}_{12}-c^{3}_{21} = 2$\n    \\item $\\frac{1}{2}(c^{3}_{13}-c^{3}_{31}) = 0 \\implies c^{3}_{13}-c^{3}_{31} = 0$\n    \\item $\\frac{1}{2}(c^{3}_{23}-c^{3}_{32}) = 0 \\implies c^{3}_{23}-c^{3}_{32} = 0$\n\\end{enumerate}\nUsing the antisymmetry property of structure constants, $c^k_{ji} = -c^k_{ij}$, we have $c^3_{21} = -c^3_{12}$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\nc^{3}_{12} - (-c^{3}_{12}) = 2 \\implies 2c^{3}_{12} = 2 \\implies c^{3}_{12} = 1\n$$\nFrom this, we find $c^{3}_{21}$:\n$$\nc^{3}_{21} = -c^{3}_{12} = -1\n$$\nFrom the other equations and antisymmetry, we have $2c^3_{13} = 0 \\implies c^3_{13}=0=c^3_{31}$ and $2c^3_{23} = 0 \\implies c^3_{23}=0=c^3_{32}$.\nThe only nonzero structure constants are $c^{3}_{12}=1$ and $c^{3}_{21}=-1$.

The image of this path under $p$ is $p(\\alpha(t)) = p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) p(k) p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))^{-1} = p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) e_G p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))^{-1} = e_G$. This means the entire path $\\alpha(t)$ lies in the fiber $p^{-1}(e_G) = \\ker p$. Since $\\ker p$ is a discrete space and $\\alpha(t)$ is a continuous path, $\\alpha(t)$ must be constant. Therefore, $\\alpha(1) = \\alpha(0)$, which means $\\tilde{g} k \\tilde{g}^{-1} = e_{\\tilde{G}} k e_{\\tilde{G}}^{-1} = k$. Since this holds for any $\\tilde{g} \\in \\tilde{G}$, $k$ is in the center of $\\tilde{G}$, denoted $Z(\\tilde{G})$. Thus, $\\ker p$ is a central subgroup of $\\tilde{G}$.\n- The group of deck transformations, $\\mathrm{Deck}(p)$, consists of homeomorphisms $\\tau : \\tilde{G} \\to \\tilde{G}$ such that $p \\circ \\tau = p$. For a universal cover, there is a canonical isomorphism $\\pi_1(G, e_G) \\cong \\mathrm{Deck}(p)$.\n- For any $k \\in \\ker p$, consider the map of right multiplication $R_k : \\tilde{G} \\to \\tilde{G}$ defined by $R_k(\\tilde{g}) = \\tilde{g}k$. This is a diffeomorphism of $\\tilde{G}$. We have $p(R_k(\\tilde{g})) = p(\\tilde{g}k) = p(\\tilde{g})p(k) = p(\\tilde{g})e_G = p(\\tilde{g})$. Thus, $R_k$ is a deck transformation. The map $k \\mapsto R_k$ is an injective group homomorphism from $\\ker p$ to $\\mathrm{Deck}(p)$.\n- Since the action of $\\mathrm{Deck}(p)$ is free and transitive on any fiber, and the right action of $\\ker p$ on the fiber $p^{-1}(e_G) = \\ker p$ is also free and transitive, this homomorphism is an isomorphism.\n- Combining these isomorphisms, we get $\\pi_1(G) \\cong \\mathrm{Deck}(p) \\cong \\ker p$. The statement is a correct and fundamental result.\n\nVerdict for A: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:** For any universal covering homomorphism $p : \\tilde{G} \\to G$ of a connected Lie group, the kernel $\\ker p$ equals the center $Z(\\tilde{G})$.\n\n- As shown in the analysis of option A, we have the inclusion $\\ker p \\subseteq Z(\\tilde{G})$. The statement claims this is always an equality.\n- Consider a counterexample. Let $\\tilde{G} = \\mathbb{R}$, the additive group of real numbers. This is a connected and simply connected abelian Lie group. Its center is the entire group, $Z(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n- Let $G = S^1$, the circle group. The map $p : \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ given by $p(x) = e^{2\\pi i x}$ is a Lie group homomorphism and the universal covering map.\n- The kernel is $\\ker p = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid e^{2\\pi i x} = 1 \\} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- In this case, $\\ker p = \\mathbb{Z}$ but $Z(\\tilde{G}) = \\mathbb{R}$. Clearly, $\\mathbb{Z} \\neq \\mathbb{R}$.\n- Therefore, the statement that $\\ker p$ always equals $Z(\\tilde{G})$ is false.\n\nVerdict for B: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:** There exists a universal covering homomorphism $p : \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\to \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ with $\\ker p = \\{\\pm I\\} \\subset Z(\\mathrm{SU}(2))$, and consequently $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n- The special unitary group $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ consists of $2 \\times 2$ unitary matrices with determinant $1$. Topologically, $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere $S^3$. Since the fundamental group of spheres $\\pi_1(S^n)$ is trivial for $n \\ge 2$, $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(2)) = \\{e\\}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is simply connected.\n- The special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is the group of rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Topologically, $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is homeomorphic to the real projective space $\\mathbb{R}P^3$. The fundamental group is $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}P^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Since this is non-trivial, $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is not simply connected.\n- Since $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is simply connected, any covering map from $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to another Lie group is a universal covering map.\n- There is a standard homomorphism $p: \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\to \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ given by the adjoint action of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ on its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$. The space $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is a $3$-dimensional real vector space identifiable with $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and the adjoint action $\\mathrm{Ad}_U(X) = UXU^{-1}$ for $U \\in \\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $X \\in \\mathfrak{su}(2)$ preserves the Killing form, which is an inner product. This makes $\\mathrm{Ad}_U$ an element of $\\mathrm{SO}(\\mathfrak{su}(2)) \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\n- The kernel of this homomorphism consists of $U \\in \\mathrm{SU}(2)$ such that $UXU^{-1} = X$ for all $X \\in \\mathfrak{su}(2)$. This means $U$ commutes with all elements of the Lie algebra, and since $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is connected, this implies $U$ must be in the center $Z(\\mathrm{SU}(2))$. The center of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is $Z(\\mathrm{SU}(2)) = \\{I, -I\\}$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. Both $I$ and $-I$ are in the kernel, so $\\ker p = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n- This map $p$ is surjective and its kernel is a discrete group of order $2$, so it is a $2:1$ covering map. Since the domain $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is simply connected, it is the universal covering map. The statement that such a homomorphism exists with $\\ker p = \\{\\pm I\\} \\subset Z(\\mathrm{SU}(2))$ is correct.\n- Using the result from Option A, $\\pi_1(G) \\cong \\ker p$. For $G=\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ and $\\tilde{G}=\\mathrm{SU}(2)$, we have $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) \\cong \\ker p = \\{\\pm I\\}$. This group has two elements, so it is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The consequence stated is also correct.\n\nVerdict for C: **Correct**.\n\n**Option D:** For a covering homomorphism $p : \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\to \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, the differential at the identity $d p_e : \\mathfrak{su}(2) \\to \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is an isomorphism of Lie algebras.\n\n- Let $p: G_1 \\to G_2$ be a Lie group homomorphism. Its differential at the identity, $dp_e: \\mathfrak{g}_1 \\to \\mathfrak{g}_2$, is a Lie algebra homomorphism.\n- A covering map between manifolds is by definition a local diffeomorphism. This means that for any point in the domain, there is a neighborhood on which the map restricts to a diffeomorphism onto its image.\n- In particular, a covering homomorphism $p : G_1 \\to G_2$ is a local diffeomorphism at the identity element $e \\in G_1$. By definition, a map between smooth manifolds is a local diffeomorphism at a point if its differential at that point is a linear isomorphism.\n- So, $dp_e : T_e G_1 \\to T_e G_2$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces. Recalling that the Lie algebras are the tangent spaces at the identity, this means $dp_e : \\mathfrak{g}_1 \\to \\mathfrak{g}_2$ is a vector space isomorphism.\n- We have a map $dp_e$ that is both a Lie algebra homomorphism and a vector space isomorphism. Such a map is, by definition, a Lie algebra isomorphism.\n- In the specific case of $p : \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\to \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, this map is a covering homomorphism between two Lie groups of the same dimension ($\\dim(\\mathrm{SU}(2)) = 3$, $\\dim(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = 3$). A local diffeomorphism between manifolds of the same dimension is a local homeomorphism. A covering map is surjective. Hence, the differential map must be an isomorphism. Therefore, $d p_e : \\mathfrak{su}(2) \\to \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is a Lie algebra isomorphism. This reflects the well-known fact that $\\mathfrak{su}(2) \\cong \\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n\nVerdict for D: **Correct**.\n\n**Option E:** For any connected Lie group $G$, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(G)$ is equal to the center $Z(G)$.\n\n- This statement proposes a general equality between two fundamentally different group structures associated with a Lie group $G$: its fundamental group $\\pi_1(G)$ (a topological invariant) and its center $Z(G)$ (an algebraic property). We can test this with counterexamples.\n- Counterexample 1: Let $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$. As established in option C, $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The center of $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ consists of rotations that commute with all other rotations. Only the identity rotation has this property. So, $Z(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = \\{I\\}$. Here, $\\pi_1(G)$ is of order $2$ while $Z(G)$ is of order $1$. They are not equal.\n- Counterexample 2: Let $G = S^1$. This is a connected abelian Lie group, so its center is the entire group, $Z(S^1) = S^1$. The fundamental group is $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The group $S^1$ is uncountable and compact, while $\\mathbb{Z}$ is countable and discrete. They are not isomorphic, let alone equal.\n- Counterexample 3: Let $G = \\mathrm{SU}(2)$. As established, $\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(2)) = \\{e\\}$ (the trivial group). The center is $Z(\\mathrm{SU}(2)) = \\{\\pm I\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Again, the two groups are not equal.\n- The statement is demonstrably false.\n\nVerdict for E: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2973561"}]}
