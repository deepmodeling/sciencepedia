We will address them sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Characterization of Killing Fields on Euclidean Space**\n\nWe are given that a smooth vector field $X$ on Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ is a Killing field if its components $X_{j}$ in standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n})$ satisfy the Killing equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{j} X_{i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\n$$\nHere, $\\partial_{i}$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^{i}$. For the standard Euclidean metric, the partial derivatives commute, i.e., $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} = \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i}$.\n\nTo determine the functional form of the components $X_{j}$, we differentiate the Killing equation with respect to a third coordinate $x^{k}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{k}(\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{j} X_{i}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(1)} \\quad \\partial_{k}\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{k}\\partial_{j} X_{i} = 0\n$$\nSince this equation holds for all indices $i, j, k$, we can generate two other equations by cyclically permuting the indices:\n$$\n\\text{(2)} \\quad \\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(3)} \\quad \\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} + \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i} X_{k} = 0\n$$\nWe now manipulate these three equations. Let's compute $(2) + (3) - (1)$:\n$$\n(\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j}) + (\\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} + \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i} X_{k}) - (\\partial_{k}\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{k}\\partial_{j} X_{i}) = 0\n$$\nUsing the commutativity of partial derivatives, we can reorder the differential operators:\n$$\n\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j} + \\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} - \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j} - \\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} = 0\n$$\nThe terms $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j}$ and $\\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\n2 \\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} = 0\n$$\nThis implies $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} = 0$ for all $i, j, k$. This equation signifies that all second partial derivatives of any component of the vector field $X$ are zero. This means that each component $X_{k}$ must be an affine function of the coordinates, i.e., a polynomial of degree at most $1$. We can therefore write each component $X_{k}$ as:\n$$\nX_{k}(x) = a_{k} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} B_{kj} x^{j}\n$$\nwhere $a_{k}$ and $B_{kj}$ are constants for all $k, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nIn vector and matrix notation, if we let $X$ be the vector of components $(X_{1}, \\dots, X_{n})^{T}$, $a$ be the constant vector $(a_{1}, \\dots, a_{n})^{T}$, and $B$ be the constant matrix with entries $B_{kj}$, this relationship can be written as:\n$$\nX(x) = a + Bx\n$$\nThis establishes that every Killing field on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an affine vector field.\n\nNext, we must determine the algebraic condition on the matrix $B$. We substitute the derived affine form of $X$ back into the original Killing equation, $\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{j} X_{i} = 0$. First, we compute the necessary derivatives:\n$$\n\\partial_{i} X_{j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( a_{j} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{jk} x^{k} \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{jk} \\frac{\\partial x^{k}}{\\partial x^{i}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{jk} \\delta_{i}^{k} = B_{ji}\n$$\nSimilarly, by swapping indices $i$ and $j$:\n$$\n\\partial_{j} X_{i} = B_{ij}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Killing equation yields:\n$$\nB_{ji} + B_{ij} = 0\n$$\nor $B_{ji} = -B_{ij}$. In matrix form, this condition is $B^{T} = -B$. This means that the matrix $B$ must be a skew-symmetric (or anti-symmetric) matrix.\n\n**Part 2: Lie Algebra of Isometries and its Dimension**\n\nThe set of isometries of a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ forms a Lie group, denoted $\\mathrm{Isom}(M,g)$. The Lie algebra of this group, denoted $\\mathfrak{isom}(M,g)$, can be identified with the vector space of all smooth Killing vector fields on $M$.\n\nFor Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$, the isometry group is the Euclidean group $E(n)$. Its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{e}(n)$ is thus the space of all Killing fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. From Part 1, we have concluded that this space consists of all affine vector fields of the form $X(x) = a + Bx$, where $a$ is an arbitrary constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $B$ is an arbitrary constant $n \\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nThis space of vector fields is a vector space, as it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Any such vector field is uniquely determined by the choice of a vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a skew-symmetric matrix $B \\in \\mathfrak{so}(n)$, where $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is the vector space of all $n \\times n$ real skew-symmetric matrices.\n\nThe dimension of this vector space is the number of independent parameters required to specify a field. This is the sum of the number of parameters for $a$ and the number of parameters for $B$.\nThe vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $n$ components, so the dimension of the space of possible vectors $a$ is $n$. These vector fields, with $B=0$, correspond to infinitesimal translations.\nThe matrix $B$ is an $n \\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix. The condition $B_{ij} = -B_{ji}$ implies that the diagonal elements must be zero ($B_{ii} = -B_{ii} \\implies 2 B_{ii} = 0 \\implies B_{ii}=0$). The entries below the main diagonal are determined by the entries above it. Therefore, we only need to specify the entries $B_{ij}$ for $i  j$. The number of such entries is the number of ways to choose $2$ distinct indices from $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2}$.\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(n)) = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n$$\nThese vector fields, with $a=0$, correspond to infinitesimal rotations about the origin.\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie algebra of the isometry group of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ is the sum of the dimensions of the space of translations and the space of infinitesimal rotations:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{e}(n)) = \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^{n}) + \\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(n)) = n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{e}(n)) = \\frac{2n}{2} + \\frac{n^{2} - n}{2} = \\frac{2n + n^{2} - n}{2} = \\frac{n^{2} + n}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\nThis is the dimension of the Lie algebra of the isometry group of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3000251"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a specific example to the general theory, this exercise explores the fundamental expression for the Lie bracket of vector fields on any Riemannian manifold.

The torsion tensor $T$ of a connection is defined for any two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ as:\n$$T(X,Y) = \\nabla_{X}Y - \\nabla_{Y}X - [X,Y]$$\nThe condition that $\\nabla$ is torsion-free means that $T(X,Y)=0$ for all $X,Y \\in \\mathfrak{X}(M)$, where $\\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is the space of smooth vector fields on $M$. This gives a fundamental identity relating the Lie bracket to the covariant derivative:\n$$[X,Y] = \\nabla_{X}Y - \\nabla_{Y}X$$\nThis identity holds for any pair of vector fields on a manifold equipped with a torsion-free connection.\n\nTo find the value of the Lie bracket at the point $p$, we evaluate the vector field $[X,Y]$ at $p$:\n$$[X,Y]_p = (\\nabla_{X}Y)_p - (\\nabla_{Y}X)_p$$\n\nNext, we must interpret the terms on the right-hand side.

Formally, $(\\nabla_U V)_p = \\nabla_{U_p} V$. The expression $\\nabla_{w}V$ for a tangent vector $w \\in T_p M$ and a vector field $V$ denotes the covariant derivative of $V$ in the direction of $w$.\n\nApplying this property to our expression for $[X,Y]_p$, with $u = X_p$ and $v = Y_p$:\n$$(\\nabla_{X}Y)_p = \\nabla_{X_p}Y = \\nabla_u Y$$\n$$(\\nabla_{Y}X)_p = \\nabla_{Y_p}X = \\nabla_v X$$\nSo we can rewrite the equation for $[X,Y]_p$ as:\n$$[X,Y]_p = \\nabla_{u}Y - \\nabla_{v}X$$\nThis expresses the result in terms of the vectors $u$ and $v$, and the covariant derivatives of the fields $X$ and $Y$.\n\nThe final step is to use the definitions of the linear maps $A$ and $B$.

The derivation relies only on the torsion-freeness of the Levi-Civita connection and the provided definitions. The fact that $X$ and $Y$ are Killing fields ensures that the maps $A$ and $B$ are well-defined linear maps (specifically, they are skew-adjoint endomorphisms on $(T_p M, g_p)$), which is a necessary condition for the problem setup to be consistent, but this property is not explicitly needed for the calculation itself.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{B(u) - A(v)}\n$$", "id": "3000246"}, {"introduction": "This practice delves into the structure of symmetries that fix a single point, a key concept for understanding symmetric spaces.

By definition of $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$, we have $X(p) = 0$ and $Y(p) = 0$. The vector field $aX + bY$ is also a complete Killing field. Evaluating it at $p$ gives:\n$$ (aX + bY)(p) = aX(p) + bY(p) = a(0) + b(0) = 0 $$\nThus, $aX + bY \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$, which confirms that $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$ is a vector subspace of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nFor the second property, let $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$. We need to show that $[X,Y](p) = 0$. Let us work in a local coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ around the point $p$. The vector fields $X$ and $Y$ can be written as $X = \\sum_{i} X^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ and $Y = \\sum_{j} Y^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. The condition $X(p) = 0$ means that all component functions $X^i$ vanish at $p$, i.e., $X^i(p) = 0$ for all $i$.
