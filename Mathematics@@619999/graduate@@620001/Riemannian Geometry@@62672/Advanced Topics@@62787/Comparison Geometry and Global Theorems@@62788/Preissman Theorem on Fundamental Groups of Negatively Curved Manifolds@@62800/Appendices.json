A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe action of an element $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ on a point $z \\in \\mathbb{H}^{2} \\cup S^{1}$ is given by the Möbius transformation $M(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$. We will analyze the properties of the given elements $A$ and $B$.\n\nLet us define the diagonal matrices\n$$\nD_t = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(-t) \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad D_s = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(s) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(-s) \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe elements $A$ and $B$ are given as $A = P D_t P^{-1}$ and $B = P D_s P^{-1}$.\n\n**Part 1: Properties of $A$ and $B$**\n\n1.  **Commutativity**: We are asked to establish that $A$ and $B$ commute. We compute the products $AB$ and $BA$:\n    $$\n    AB = (P D_t P^{-1})(P D_s P^{-1}) = P D_t (P^{-1}P) D_s P^{-1} = P D_t I D_s P^{-1} = P (D_t D_s) P^{-1}.\n    $$\n    $$\n    BA = (P D_s P^{-1})(P D_t P^{-1}) = P D_s (P^{-1}P) D_t P^{-1} = P D_s I D_t P^{-1} = P (D_s D_t) P^{-1}.\n    $$\n    Since $D_t$ and $D_s$ are diagonal matrices, they commute:\n    $$\n    D_t D_s = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(-t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(s) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(-s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(t+s) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(-(t+s)) \\end{pmatrix} = D_s D_t.\n    $$\n    Therefore, $AB = P (D_t D_s) P^{-1} = P (D_s D_t) P^{-1} = BA$. The elements $A$ and $B$ commute.\n\n2.  **Hyperbolicity**: An element $M \\in \\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ is hyperbolic if its trace satisfies $|\\operatorname{tr}(M)| > 2$. The trace is invariant under conjugation, i.e., $\\operatorname{tr}(PMP^{-1}) = \\operatorname{tr}(M)$.\n    For element $A$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}(A) = \\operatorname{tr}(P D_t P^{-1}) = \\operatorname{tr}(D_t) = \\exp(t) + \\exp(-t) = 2\\cosh(t).\n    $$\n    Since $t > 0$, we have $\\cosh(t) > 1$, which implies $|\\operatorname{tr}(A)| = 2\\cosh(t) > 2$. Thus, $A$ is a hyperbolic element.\n    Similarly, for element $B$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}(B) = \\operatorname{tr}(P D_s P^{-1}) = \\operatorname{tr}(D_s) = \\exp(s) + \\exp(-s) = 2\\cosh(s).\n    $$\n    Since $s > 0$, we have $\\cosh(s) > 1$, which implies $|\\operatorname{tr}(B)| = 2\\cosh(s) > 2$. Thus, $B$ is also a hyperbolic element.\n\n3.  **Shared Fixed Points**: A point $x \\in S^{1}$ is a fixed point of an element $M$ if $M(x) = x$.\n    Let $x$ be a fixed point of $A$. Then $A(x) = x$, which is equivalent to $(P D_t P^{-1})(x) = x$. Applying $P^{-1}$ to both sides, we get $D_t(P^{-1}(x)) = P^{-1}(x)$. This means that $P^{-1}(x)$ is a fixed point of the transformation associated with $D_t$.\n    The transformation for $D_t$ is $z \\mapsto \\exp(2t)z$. The fixed points are the solutions to $\\exp(2t)z = z$. Since $t > 0$, $\\exp(2t) \\neq 1$, so the only finite solution is $z = 0$. The other fixed point is at infinity, as $\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\exp(2t)z = \\infty$.\n    Thus, the fixed points of the transformation $D_t$ are $\\{0, \\infty\\}$.\n    This implies that the set of values for $P^{-1}(x)$ must be $\\{0, \\infty\\}$. Consequently, the set of fixed points of $A$ is $\\{P(0), P(\\infty)\\}$.\n    The exact same argument holds for $B$, as its diagonalizable form $D_s$ also has fixed points $\\{0, \\infty\\}$. Therefore, the fixed points of $B$ are also $\\{P(0), P(\\infty)\\}$.\n    Conclusion: $A$ and $B$ have the same set of fixed points.\n\n4.  **Shared Axis**: For a hyperbolic element, its axis is the unique geodesic in $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ connecting its two fixed points on the ideal boundary $S^{1}$. Since $A$ and $B$ are both hyperbolic and share the same two fixed points, they must share the same axis of translation.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Common Fixed Points**\n\nThe common fixed points are $x_{+} = P(\\infty)$ and $x_{-} = P(0)$, where $P$ is the Möbius transformation corresponding to the matrix $P = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe transformation is $P(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$.\n\nWe compute the image of $0$:\n$$\nx_{-} = P(0) = \\frac{a(0)+b}{c(0)+d} = \\frac{b}{d}.\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined because the problem states $d \\neq 0$.\n\nWe compute the image of $\\infty$:\n$$\nx_{+} = P(\\infty) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} P(z) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{az+b}{cz+d} = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{a + b/z}{c + d/z} = \\frac{a}{c}.\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined because the problem states $c \\neq 0$.\n\nSince $a, b, c, d$ are the entries of a matrix in $\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, they are real numbers. Therefore, the fixed points $a/c$ and $b/d$ are real numbers and lie on the ideal boundary $\\mathbb{R} \\subset S^{1}$.\n\nThe unordered pair of common fixed points is $\\{\\frac{a}{c}, \\frac{b}{d}\\}$.\n\nTo distinguish them, we can analyze the dynamics. For $D_t(z) = \\exp(2t)z$ with $t>0$, the origin $z=0$ is a repulsive fixed point, and $z=\\infty$ is an attractive fixed point. The conjugating map $P$ is a homeomorphism, so it preserves the nature of the fixed points. Therefore, $x_{-} = P(0) = b/d$ is the repulsive fixed point and $x_{+} = P(\\infty) = a/c$ is the attractive fixed point for both $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe problem asks for the unordered pair, which we express as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a}{c} & \\frac{b}{d} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2986378"}, {"introduction": "With the geometric foundation in place, we now apply Preissman's theorem directly to analyze the structure of the fundamental group.

The manifold $M$ is the quotient space $M = \\mathbb{H}^{3}/\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is the group of deck transformations, which is isomorphic to the fundamental group $\\pi_{1}(M)$. An element $A \\in \\Gamma$ is a loxodromic isometry of the universal cover $\\mathbb{H}^{3}$. A loxodromic isometry $A$ has exactly two fixed points on the boundary at infinity $\\partial\\mathbb{H}^{3}$, and it preserves the unique geodesic $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$ connecting these two points. The action of $A$ on $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$ is a translation by a certain distance, called the translation length of $A$. The projection of this invariant axis to the quotient manifold, $\\gamma_{A} = \\pi(\\mathrm{Ax}(A))$, is a closed geodesic. The length of $\\gamma_{A}$ is the translation length of $A$. A closed geodesic is defined as primitive if it is not a multiple wrapping of another, shorter, closed geodesic. In the context of the fundamental group, a closed geodesic corresponding to an element $g \\in \\Gamma$ is primitive if and only if the element $g$ is primitive. An element $g \\in \\Gamma$ is primitive if it cannot be written in the form $h^k$ for any $h \\in \\Gamma$ and any integer $k$ with $|k|>1$. The problem statement explicitly assumes that the element $A \\in \\Gamma$ is primitive. Therefore, the associated closed geodesic $\\gamma_{A}$ is, by definition, a primitive closed geodesic in $M$.\n\nNext, we analyze the centralizer $C_{\\Gamma}(A) = \\{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma : \\gamma A = A \\gamma\\}$.\nFirst, we establish that $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is an abelian subgroup of $\\Gamma$. Let $\\gamma$ be any element in $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$. Since $\\gamma$ commutes with $A$, $\\gamma$ must map the set of fixed points of $A$ to itself. For a loxodromic isometry $A$, the fixed point set in $\\partial\\mathbb{H}^3$ consists of a source and a sink. As an element of $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbb{C})$, $\\gamma$ is an orientation-preserving isometry. An orientation-preserving isometry that maps the endpoints of a geodesic (the axis $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$) to themselves must either fix both endpoints or swap them. If $\\gamma$ were to swap the endpoints, it would be an elliptic rotation of order $2$ around a geodesic perpendicular to $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$. However, the group $\\Gamma$ is given as torsion-free, meaning it contains no elements of finite order other than the identity. Thus, any non-identity element $\\gamma \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ must fix the endpoints of $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$. This implies that $\\gamma$ must preserve the axis $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$.\nAny two isometries of $\\mathbb{H}^{3}$ that preserve the same geodesic axis commute. This is a standard fact that can be seen by conjugating the axis to be, for instance, the vertical axis in the upper half-space model, where such isometries are compositions of dilations and rotations around that axis, actions which commute. Therefore, any two elements $\\gamma_{1}, \\gamma_{2} \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ commute with each other. This shows that $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is an abelian subgroup of $\\Gamma$.\n\nSince $A$ is a loxodromic isometry, it is of infinite order. Thus, $A$ is a non-trivial element of $\\Gamma$. The centralizer $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ contains $A$, so $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is a non-trivial subgroup.\nThe manifold $M$ is a closed orientable hyperbolic $3$-manifold. This implies that its sectional curvature is constant and equal to $-1$. Therefore, $M$ has strictly negative sectional curvature. We are instructed to use Preissman’s theorem, which states that for a compact manifold with strictly negative sectional curvature, any non-trivial abelian subgroup of its fundamental group is infinite cyclic.\nSince $M$ is a closed manifold, it is compact. Its fundamental group is $\\pi_{1}(M) \\cong \\Gamma$. We have established that $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is a non-trivial abelian subgroup of $\\Gamma$. By Preissman's theorem, $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ must be an infinite cyclic group, which is isomorphic to the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. The problem asks to determine the integer $r \\ge 0$ such that $C_{\\Gamma}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{r}$. From our deduction, we have $r=1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the index $\\big[C_{\\Gamma}(A) : \\langle A \\rangle \\big]$.\nSince $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is an infinite cyclic group, there exists a generator $B \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ such that $C_{\\Gamma}(A) = \\langle B \\rangle$. Since $A \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$, $A$ must be a power of the generator $B$. So, we can write $A = B^k$ for some non-zero integer $k$.\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: $A$ is a primitive element in $\\Gamma$. By definition, this means $A$ cannot be expressed as a proper power of any other element in $\\Gamma$. That is, one cannot write $A = g^n$ for any $g \\in \\Gamma$ and integer $n$ with $|n| > 1$.\nApplying this to our finding that $A = B^k$, the primitivity of $A$ forces $|k| \\le 1$. Since $A$ is not the identity, $k \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $|k|=1$, which implies $k=1$ or $k=-1$.\nIf $k=1$, then $A=B$. In this case, the subgroup generated by $A$ is $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle B \\rangle$, which is the entire centralizer group $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$.\nIf $k=-1$, then $A=B^{-1}$. The subgroup generated by $A$ is $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle B^{-1} \\rangle$. Since a cyclic group is generated by an element or its inverse, $\\langle B^{-1} \\rangle = \\langle B \\rangle = C_{\\Gamma}(A)$.\nIn both possible cases, we conclude that the subgroup $\\langle A \\rangle$ is equal to the group $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$.\nThe index of a subgroup in a group, $[G:H]$, is the number of distinct left (or right) cosets of $H$ in $G$. When the subgroup is the group itself, i.e., $H=G$, there is only one coset, which is $H$ itself. Thus, the index is $1$.\nFor our problem, the index is $\\big[C_{\\Gamma}(A) : \\langle A \\rangle \\big] = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2986415"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice extends this reasoning to explore finer group-theoretic structures beyond basic abelian subgroups.

An element $h \\in \\Gamma$ belongs to the normalizer $N_{\\Gamma}(\\langle \\gamma \\rangle)$ if and only if $h \\langle \\gamma \\rangle h^{-1} = \\langle \\gamma \\rangle$. Since $\\gamma$ is a loxodromic element, it has infinite order, and the cyclic group $\\langle \\gamma \\rangle$ is isomorphic to the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. The only generators of an infinite cyclic group are the element itself and its inverse. Thus, the condition $h \\langle \\gamma \\rangle h^{-1} = \\langle \\gamma \\rangle$ is equivalent to the condition that $h \\gamma h^{-1}$ is a generator of $\\langle \\gamma \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for any $h \\in N_{\\Gamma}(\\langle \\gamma \\rangle)$, we must have one of two possibilities:\n$1$. $h \\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma$\n$2$. $h \\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma^{-1}$\n\nAn element $h$ satisfies the first condition if and only if $h \\in C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma)$.

To see this, let $h$ be another element such that $h \\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma^{-1}$. Then we have $(h_0^{-1} h) \\gamma (h_0^{-1} h)^{-1} = h_0^{-1} (h \\gamma h^{-1}) h_0 = h_0^{-1} \\gamma^{-1} h_0 = (h_0^{-1} \\gamma h_0)^{-1} = (\\gamma^{-1})^{-1} = \\gamma$. This shows that $h_0^{-1} h \\in C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma)$, which implies $h \\in h_0 C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma)$.\nIn this case, the normalizer is the disjoint union of two cosets: $N_{\\Gamma}(\\langle \\gamma \\rangle) = C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma) \\cup h_0 C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma)$.

Its attracting fixed point is $\\xi^{-}_{\\gamma}$ and its repelling fixed point is $\\xi^{+}_{\\gamma}$. Its axis is the same geodesic $A_{\\gamma}$ but with the opposite orientation.\n\nIf there exists an element $h \\in \\Gamma$ such that $h \\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma^{-1}$, then the set of fixed points of $h \\gamma h^{-1}$ on $\\partial \\widetilde{M}$ must be the same as the set of fixed points of $\\gamma^{-1}$. This implies:\n$$\n\\{ h(\\xi^{+}_{\\gamma}), h(\\xi^{-}_{\\gamma}) \\} = \\{ \\xi^{-}_{\\gamma}, \\xi^{+}_{\\gamma} \\}\n$$\nThis leaves two possibilities for the action of $h$ on the fixed points of $\\gamma$:\n(a) $h(\\xi^{+}_{\\gamma}) = \\xi^{+}_{\\gamma}$ and $h(\\xi^{-}_{\\gamma}) = \\xi^{-}_{\\gamma}$. In this case, $h$ fixes the endpoints of the axis $A_{\\gamma}$. An isometry that fixes two points on the ideal boundary must preserve the geodesic connecting them. Thus, $h(A_{\\gamma}) = A_{\\gamma}$ and $h$ preserves the orientation of $A_{\\gamma}$. Isometries that preserve an axis and its orientation (i.e., translations along it) commute. Thus, $h$ would commute with $\\gamma$, meaning $h \\in C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma)$. This contradicts our assumption that $h \\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma^{-1}$ (since $\\gamma \\neq \\gamma^{-1}$ as $\\gamma$ is loxodromic and thus not of order $2$).\n(b) $h(\\xi^{+}_{\\gamma}) = \\xi^{-}_{\\gamma}$ and $h(\\xi^{-}_{\\gamma}) = \\xi^{+}_{\\gamma}$. In this case, the isometry $h$ swaps the endpoints of the axis $A_{\\gamma}$. Geometrically, this means that $h$ must map the geodesic $A_{\\gamma}$ to itself but reverse its orientation.\n\nWe now use a fundamental property of isometries of CAT($0$) spaces (a category that includes all simply connected manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature, like $\\widetilde{M}$). An isometry of a CAT($0$) space that preserves a geodesic and reverses its orientation must have a fixed point on that geodesic. Let $A_\\gamma$ be parameterized by arc length as $c(t)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. An orientation-reversing isometry $h$ preserving $A_\\gamma$ acts as $h(c(t)) = c(-t+s)$ for some constant $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A fixed point occurs at $t_0$ where $c(t_0) = h(c(t_0))$, which implies $t_0 = -t_0+s$, or $t_0 = s/2$. Such a point is unique on the geodesic.\n\nHowever, the problem states that $\\Gamma = \\pi_{1}(M)$ acts freely on $\\widetilde{M}$. A free action means that for any non-identity element $g \\in \\Gamma$, $g$ has no fixed points in $\\widetilde{M}$.\nIf an element $h \\in \\Gamma$ were to satisfy $h\\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma^{-1}$, it would have to reverse the axis $A_{\\gamma}$ and therefore have a fixed point in $\\widetilde{M}$. Due to the free action of $\\Gamma$, this implies that $h$ must be the identity element. But if $h$ is the identity, then $\\gamma = \\gamma^{-1}$ or $\\gamma^2 = \\text{id}$. This is impossible for a loxodromic element $\\gamma$, as any element of finite order in a group acting freely on a CAT(0) space must be the identity, while $\\gamma$ is a non-identity element that translates points along its axis.\n\nTherefore, there can be no element $h \\in \\Gamma$ that satisfies $h\\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma^{-1}$.\nThis implies that the only possibility for an element $h \\in N_{\\Gamma}(\\langle \\gamma \\rangle)$ is $h\\gamma h^{-1} = \\gamma$.\nThus, every element of the normalizer is also an element of the centralizer: $N_{\\Gamma}(\\langle \\gamma \\rangle) = C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma)$.\n\nThe index of a subgroup in itself is $1$.\n$$\n\\big[ N_{\\Gamma}(\\langle \\gamma \\rangle) : C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma) \\big] = \\frac{|N_{\\Gamma}(\\langle \\gamma \\rangle)|}{|C_{\\Gamma}(\\gamma)|} = 1\n$$\nThis conclusion relies critically on the free action of the fundamental group $\\Gamma$ on the universal cover $\\widetilde{M}$, a direct consequence of $M$ being a manifold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2986411"}]}
