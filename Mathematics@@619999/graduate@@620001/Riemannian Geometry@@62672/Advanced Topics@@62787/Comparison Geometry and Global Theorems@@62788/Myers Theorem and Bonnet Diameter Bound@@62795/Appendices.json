We shall proceed by addressing each part of the problem sequentially.\n\nLet $S^n$ be the $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r > 0$ embedded in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The sphere is defined as the set of points $\\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : |p|^2 = r^2\\}$. The Riemannian metric $g$ on $S^n$ is the one induced by the standard Euclidean dot product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The problem specifies the radius $r = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ for some constant $\\kappa > 0$. We are given that $n \\ge 2$.\n\n**Part 1: Curvature of the Sphere**\n\nWe first determine the curvature of $(S^n, g)$ using the Gauss equation for a hypersurface. Let $i: S^n \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the inclusion map. The ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is flat, so its Riemann curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ is identically zero. Let $N$ be the outward-pointing unit normal vector field on $S^n$. At a point $p \\in S^n$, $N_p = p/r$.\n\nThe shape operator (or Weingarten map) $S_p: T_p S^n \\to T_p S^n$ and the second fundamental form $II$ are crucial. The shape operator is defined via the derivative of the normal vector. For $X \\in T_pS^n$, the derivative of the normal map in direction $X$ is $\\bar{\\nabla}_X N = \\frac{1}{r}\\bar{\\nabla}_X p = \\frac{1}{r}X$. The second fundamental form $II(X,Y)$ can be related to this and the shape operator. Using a common sign convention where $S(X)=-\\bar{\\nabla}_X N$, we would get $S(X)=-X/r$. Let's use the convention where the second fundamental form $II(X,Y)$ is defined as $g(\\bar{\\nabla}_X Y, N)$. This leads to $II(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{r}g(X,Y)$.\n\nThe Gauss equation relates the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of $S^n$ (as a $(0,4)$-tensor) to the second fundamental form $II$:\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = II(X,W)II(Y,Z) - II(X,Z)II(Y,W) $$\nSubstituting our expression for $II$:\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(X,W)\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(Y,Z)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(X,Z)\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{r}g(Y,W)\\right) $$\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left( g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right) $$\nGiven $r = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, we have $1/r^2 = \\kappa$. Thus, the Riemann curvature tensor is:\n$$ R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right) $$\nFrom this, we can find the $(1,3)$-tensor $R(X,Y)Z$:\n$$ g(R(X,Y)Z, W) = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)g(X,W) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right) = g(\\kappa(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y), W) $$\nSince this holds for any vector field $W$, we identify:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y \\right) $$\nThis confirms that $S^n$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. Now, we compute the Ricci curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$. Let $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a local orthonormal frame for the tangent bundle $TS^n$. The Ricci tensor is defined by the trace of the Riemann tensor:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(R(E_i, Y)Z, E_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n R(E_i, Y, Z, E_i) $$\nUsing the component form of the Riemann tensor:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\kappa \\left( g(Y,Z)g(E_i,E_i) - g(E_i,Z)g(Y,E_i) \\right) $$\nSince $\\{E_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g(E_i, E_j) = \\delta_{ij}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\kappa \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( g(Y,Z) \\cdot 1 - g(E_i,Z)g(Y,E_i) \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\kappa \\left( n \\cdot g(Y,Z) - \\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y,E_i)g(Z,E_i) \\right) $$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y,E_i)g(Z,E_i)$ is simply the inner product $g(Y,Z)$ expressed in the orthonormal basis $\\{E_i\\}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\kappa (n \\cdot g(Y,Z) - g(Y,Z)) = (n-1)\\kappa g(Y,Z) $$\nThis holds for all vector fields $Y, Z$, so we have verified that $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)\\kappa g$.\n\n**Part 2: Diameter of the Sphere**\n\nThe geodesics on the round sphere $(S^n,g)$ are its great circles. A great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a $2$-dimensional plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\nThe geodesic distance $d(p,q)$ between two points $p, q \\in S^n$ is the length of the shorter arc of the great circle connecting them. If $\\theta$ is the angle (in radians, $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$) between the position vectors $p$ and $q$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the arc length is given by $d(p,q) = r\\theta$. The angle is given by $\\theta = \\arccos(\\langle p,q \\rangle / r^2)$.\n\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of the geodesic distances between all pairs of its points:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) = \\sup_{p,q \\in S^n} d(p,q) $$\nThe maximum distance occurs when the angle $\\theta$ is maximized, which is $\\theta = \\pi$. This corresponds to pairs of antipodal points, i.e., $q = -p$.\nTherefore, the diameter of the sphere is:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) = r \\cdot \\pi $$\nSubstituting $r = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, we find the exact diameter:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Bonnet-Myers Theorem and Comparison**\n\nThe Bonnet–Myers theorem states that if $(M,g)$ is a complete, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\mathrm{Ric}(v,v) \\ge (n-1)K g(v,v)$ for all tangent vectors $v$ and for some constant $K > 0$, then $M$ is compact and its diameter is bounded above by $\\pi/\\sqrt{K}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that the Ricci curvature of $(S^n,g)$ is precisely $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)\\kappa g$. This can be written as:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ric}(v,v) = (n-1)\\kappa g(v,v) $$\nThis satisfies the condition of the Bonnet–Myers theorem with the constant $K = \\kappa$. The sphere $S^n$ is complete and compact. The theorem thus provides the following upper bound for its diameter:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} $$\nComparing this result with the actual diameter calculated in Part 2, we see that the upper bound provided by the Bonnet–Myers theorem is sharp and is achieved by the sphere:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(S^n)_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} = \\operatorname{diam}(S^n)_{\\text{Bonnet-Myers bound}} $$\nThis equality is a hallmark of spaces of constant curvature, which serve as the model spaces in comparison geometry.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe final task is to compute the value of the expression $\\kappa \\cdot (\\operatorname{diam}(S^n))^2$. Using the result from Part 2:\n$$ (\\operatorname{diam}(S^n))^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\kappa} $$\nNow, we multiply by $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\kappa \\cdot (\\operatorname{diam}(S^n))^2 = \\kappa \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\kappa} = \\pi^2 $$\nThe value of the expression is $\\pi^2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\pi^2} $$", "id": "2984947"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a theorem often comes from studying cases that lie at the boundary of its hypotheses.

The first part requires an explanation for why the flat $n$-torus $T^{n}$ does not satisfy the hypothesis of the Bonnet–Myers theorem. The second part requires the computation of its diameter.\n\nPart 1: Validation of the Bonnet–Myers Theorem Hypothesis\n\nThe Bonnet–Myers theorem applies to complete Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$ of dimension $n$. Its crucial hypothesis is the existence of a strictly positive lower bound on the Ricci curvature. Specifically, it requires that there exists a constant $k > 0$ such that for any tangent vector $v \\in T_p M$ at any point $p \\in M$, the Ricci curvature satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric}(v, v) \\ge (n-1)k \\|v\\|^2$.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary principles to analyze the curvature of the flat $n$-torus $T^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\Lambda$.\n\n1.  The starting point is the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. As stated in the provided principles, the Euclidean metric is flat, which means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero everywhere. Let $R_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}$ be this tensor; then $R_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\equiv 0$.\n\n2.  The Ricci curvature tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}$, is obtained by taking a trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. In local coordinates, if $R_{ijkl}$ are the components of the Riemann tensor, the components of the Ricci tensor are given by $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ik} = g^{jl} R_{jikl}$. Since all components of the Riemann tensor on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are zero, all components of its Ricci tensor must also be zero. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\equiv 0$.\n\n3.  The torus $T^{n}$ is constructed as the quotient of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by the lattice $\\Lambda$, which acts by isometries (translations). The problem statement notes that a quotient of a Riemannian manifold by a free, properly discontinuous action by isometries inherits a locally isometric structure. This means that the metric on $T^n$ is locally indistinguishable from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Consequently, the Riemann curvature tensor on $T^{n}$, denoted $R_{T^{n}}$, is also identically zero.\n\n4.  Following the same logic as for $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, since the Riemann curvature tensor of $T^{n}$ is zero, its Ricci curvature tensor must also be zero, i.e., $\\operatorname{Ric}_{T^{n}} \\equiv 0$.\n\nThe hypothesis of the Bonnet–Myers theorem requires the existence of a constant $k > 0$ such that the Ricci curvature is bounded below by this positive value. For the flat torus $T^{n}$, the Ricci curvature is exactly $0$. Therefore, for any choice of $k > 0$, the inequality $\\operatorname{Ric}_{T^{n}} \\ge (n-1)k > 0$ is false. The condition is not met, a fact directly following from the flat nature of the manifold.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Diameter\n\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is defined as the supremum of the geodesic distance over all pairs of points in the manifold:\n$$\n\\text{diam}(M) = \\sup_{p, q \\in M} d(p, q)\n$$\nFor the torus $T^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\Lambda$, the points are equivalence classes $[x]$ of points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The geodesic distance between two points $[x]$ and $[y]$ is given by the infimum of the Euclidean distances between their representatives in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, taken over all possible lattice translations of one of the points. As provided in the problem statement:\n$$\nd_{T^n}([x], [y]) = \\inf_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} d_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(x, y+\\lambda)\n$$\nHere, $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ and $y = (y_1, \\dots, y_n)$ are points in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $\\Lambda$ is the lattice generated by the vectors $\\{a_1 e_1, \\dots, a_n e_n\\}$. Any lattice vector $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$ can be written as $\\lambda = (k_1 a_1, \\dots, k_n a_n)$ for some integers $k_1, \\dots, k_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe squared Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $d_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(x, z)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - z_i)^2$. Substituting $z = y + \\lambda$, we get:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(x, y+\\lambda)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - (y_i + k_i a_i))^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i - k_i a_i)^2\n$$\nThe infimum over $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$ can be distributed over the sum, as each term in the sum depends on an independent integer $k_i$:\n$$\nd_{T^n}([x], [y])^2 = \\inf_{\\{k_i\\} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i - k_i a_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (x_i - y_i - k_i a_i)^2\n$$\nFor each coordinate $i$, we need to evaluate $\\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |x_i - y_i - k_i a_i|$. This is the shortest distance from the point $(x_i - y_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ to a point in the one-dimensional lattice $a_i \\mathbb{Z} = \\{k_i a_i \\mid k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This minimum distance is achieved by choosing $k_i a_i$ to be the nearest multiple of $a_i$ to $(x_i - y_i)$. The value of this minimum distance can be found by reducing the difference $(x_i - y_i)$ modulo $a_i$ to the interval $[-a_i/2, a_i/2]$. Let this reduced value be $\\delta_i^{\\prime}$. Then $\\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |x_i - y_i - k_i a_i| = |\\delta_i^{\\prime}|$.\n\nTo find the diameter of $T^{n}$, we must find the supremum of $d_{T^n}([x], [y])$ over all pairs of points $[x], [y] \\in T^{n}$. This is equivalent to finding points $x, y$ that maximize the distance expression derived above. The maximization can be performed for each coordinate component independently. For each $i$, we need to maximize the term $\\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (x_i - y_i - k_i a_i)^2$.\n\nThe value $|\\delta_i^{\\prime}|$ lies in the interval $[0, a_i/2]$. The maximum value it can attain is $a_i/2$. This occurs when the difference $(x_i - y_i)$ is exactly halfway between two consecutive multiples of $a_i$, for example, when $x_i - y_i$ is congruent to $a_i/2$ modulo $a_i$.\n\nWe can choose points $[x]$ and $[y]$ in $T^{n}$ such that this condition is met for all coordinates simultaneously. For instance, let $[y]$ be the equivalence class of the origin, $y = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$. Now we choose a point $[x]$ whose representative $x$ maximizes the distance. We can choose $x = (a_1/2, a_2/2, \\dots, a_n/2)$. The difference vector is $x-y = (a_1/2, \\dots, a_n/2)$.\nFor this pair of points, the squared distance on the torus is:\n$$\nd_{T^n}([x], [y])^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\frac{a_i}{2} - k_i a_i \\right| \\right)^2\n$$\nFor each $i$, the infimum $\\inf_{k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\frac{a_i}{2} - k_i a_i|$ is achieved for $k_i=0$ (or $k_i=1$), yielding a value of $a_i/2$. Therefore, the squared distance is:\n$$\n\\sup_{[x],[y] \\in T^n} d_{T^n}([x], [y])^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{a_i}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2\n$$\nThis represents the squared distance between the \"most distant\" points on the torus.

The metric $g$ is the Fubini-Study metric, normalized such that the constant holomorphic sectional curvature is $4$.\n\n(a) Computation of the Ricci Tensor\n\nFor a Kähler manifold with constant holomorphic sectional curvature $c$, the sectional curvature $K(X, Y)$ of a plane spanned by an orthonormal pair of vectors $\\{X, Y\\}$ is given by the formula:\n$$ K(X, Y) = \\frac{c}{4} (1 + 3g(X, JY)^2) $$\nwhere $J$ is the complex structure.

The distance $d([z_1], [z_2])$ between two points in $\\mathbb{CP}^m$ represented by unit vectors $z_1, z_2 \\in S^{2m+1}$ is given by the formula:\n$$ d([z_1], [z_2]) = \\arccos(|\\langle z_1, z_2 \\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}^{m+1}}|) $$\nThe diameter is the maximum possible distance between any two points. The value of $|\\langle z_1, z_2 \\rangle|$ ranges from $0$ (for orthogonal vectors) to $1$ (for vectors on the same complex line). The distance is maximized when $|\\langle z_1, z_2 \\rangle|$ is minimized, i.e., when $\\langle z_1, z_2 \\rangle = 0$.\n$$ \\mathrm{diam}(\\mathbb{CP}^m) = \\arccos(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nAlternatively, we can compute the length of a maximal geodesic. A geodesic starting at $[1:0:\\dots:0]$ can be written as $\\gamma(t) = [\\cos(t) : \\sin(t) : 0 : \\dots : 0]$. This is a unit-speed geodesic for the normalization with $c=4$. The cut locus of the point $[1:0:\\dots:0]$ is the projective hyperplane where the first coordinate is zero. The geodesic first reaches this cut locus when $\\cos(t)=0$, which is at $t=\\pi/2$. The distance to the cut locus is therefore $\\pi/2$, which is the diameter.\n\nFinally, we form the ratio $R(m)$ of the actual diameter to the Myers upper bound:\n$$ R(m) = \\frac{\\mathrm{diam}(\\mathbb{CP}^m)}{D_{\\text{Myers}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{2m-1}{2m+2}}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2m-1}{2m+2}}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2m+2}{2m-1}} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2m+2}{2m-1}}}\n$$", "id": "2984915"}]}
