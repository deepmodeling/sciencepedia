We will proceed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Busemann function $b_{v}(p)$.\n\nLet $p=(x,y)$ be an arbitrary point in $M = S^{k}(a) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{q}$. The ray $\\gamma_{v}(t)$ is given by $\\gamma_{v}(t) = (x_{0}, tv)$, where $x_{0} \\in S^{k}(a)$ is a fixed base point and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is a unit vector. The Busemann function associated with this ray is defined as\n$$\nb_{v}(p) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( t - d\\big(p, \\gamma_{v}(t)\\big) \\right).\n$$\nThe metric on the product manifold $M$ induces a distance function $d$ which satisfies the Pythagorean identity. For two points $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ in $M$, the squared distance is given by:\n$$\nd(p_1, p_2)^2 = d_{S^k(a)}(x_1, x_2)^2 + d_{\\mathbb{R}^q}(y_1, y_2)^2.\n$$\nHere, $d_{S^k(a)}$ is the geodesic distance on the sphere $S^k(a)$, and $d_{\\mathbb{R}^q}$ is the standard Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^q$.\n\nWe apply this to find the distance between $p=(x,y)$ and $\\gamma_{v}(t) = (x_{0}, tv)$:\n$$\nd\\big(p, \\gamma_{v}(t)\\big)^2 = d_{S^k(a)}(x, x_0)^2 + d_{\\mathbb{R}^q}(y, tv)^2.\n$$\nThe distance on the sphere $d_{S^k(a)}(x, x_0)$ is a constant with respect to $t$. Let us denote it by $d_S$. The distance in Euclidean space is given by the norm of the difference vector:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{R}^q}(y, tv)^2 = \\|y - tv\\|^2.\n$$\nWe expand the squared norm using the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\|y-tv\\|^2 = \\langle y-tv, y-tv \\rangle = \\langle y,y \\rangle - 2\\langle y,tv \\rangle + \\langle tv, tv \\rangle = \\|y\\|^2 - 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle + t^2\\|v\\|^2.\n$$\nSince $v$ is a unit vector, $\\|v\\|=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\|y-tv\\|^2 = t^2 - 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle + \\|y\\|^2.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the distance on $M$:\n$$\nd\\big(p, \\gamma_{v}(t)\\big) = \\sqrt{d_S^2 + t^2 - 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle + \\|y\\|^2}.\n$$\nNow we can evaluate the limit in the definition of the Busemann function.\n$$\nb_{v}(x,y) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( t - \\sqrt{t^2 - 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle + d_S^2 + \\|y\\|^2} \\right).\n$$\nThis is an indeterminate form of type $\\infty - \\infty$. We resolve it by multiplying by the conjugate expression:\n$$\nb_{v}(x,y) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\left( t - \\sqrt{\\dots} \\right)\\left( t + \\sqrt{\\dots} \\right)}{t + \\sqrt{t^2 - 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle + d_S^2 + \\|y\\|^2}}.\n$$\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\nt^2 - (t^2 - 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle + d_S^2 + \\|y\\|^2) = 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle - (d_S^2 + \\|y\\|^2).\n$$\nSo the expression for $b_v(x,y)$ is:\n$$\nb_{v}(x,y) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{2t\\langle y,v \\rangle - d_S^2 - \\|y\\|^2}{t + \\sqrt{t^2 - 2t\\langle y,v \\rangle + d_S^2 + \\|y\\|^2}}.\n$$\nTo evaluate the limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $t$:\n$$\nb_{v}(x,y) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\langle y,v \\rangle - \\frac{d_S^2 + \\|y\\|^2}{t}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2\\langle y,v \\rangle}{t} + \\frac{d_S^2 + \\|y\\|^2}{t^2}}}.\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the terms with $t$ in the denominator go to $0$. The limit becomes:\n$$\nb_{v}(x,y) = \\frac{2\\langle y,v \\rangle - 0}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 0 + 0}} = \\frac{2\\langle y,v \\rangle}{1+1} = \\langle y,v \\rangle.\n$$\nThe closed-form expression for the Busemann function is remarkably simple and depends only on the Euclidean component $y$ of the point $p=(x,y)$ and the direction vector $v$.\n$$\nb_{v}(x,y) = \\langle y, v \\rangle.\n$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the potential function $b(p)$ and identification of the soul.\n\nThe Cheeger–Gromoll potential function $b(p)$ is defined as the supremum of the Busemann functions over all possible ray directions:\n$$\nb(p) = b(x,y) = \\sup_{\\|v\\| = 1, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^q} b_{v}(x,y).\n$$\nSubstituting our result from Part 1:\n$$\nb(x,y) = \\sup_{\\|v\\| = 1} \\langle y, v \\rangle.\n$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $|\\langle y, v \\rangle| \\le \\|y\\| \\|v\\|$. Since $\\|v\\|=1$, this implies $\\langle y, v \\rangle \\le \\|y\\|$. This maximum value is achieved when the unit vector $v$ points in the same direction as $y$, i.e., $v = y/\\|y\\|$ (for $y \\neq 0$). If $y=0$, then $\\langle 0, v \\rangle = 0$ for all $v$, so the supremum is $0$. In both cases, the supremum is equal to the Euclidean norm of $y$.\nThus, the closed-form expression for the potential function is:\n$$\nb(x,y) = \\|y\\|.\n$$\nThe soul of the manifold $M$ is defined as the minimum set of the potential function $b(p)$. We need to find the points $p=(x,y) \\in M$ where $b(x,y) = \\|y\\|$ is minimized. The Euclidean norm $\\|y\\|$ is always non-negative, and its minimum value is $0$. This minimum is achieved if and only if $y=0$.\nThe set of points where $b$ is minimal is therefore:\n$$\nS = \\{ (x,y) \\in S^{k}(a) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{q} \\mid y = 0 \\}.\n$$\nThis set is $S^{k}(a) \\times \\{0\\}$, which is a submanifold of $M$ isometric to the sphere $S^{k}(a)$. This submanifold is compact (as $S^k(a)$ is compact), totally geodesic, and totally convex, as guaranteed by the Soul Theorem. The soul of $M$ is this submanifold $S$.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the volume of the soul.\n\nThe soul of $M$ is the submanifold $S = S^{k}(a) \\times \\{0\\}$. The metric induced on $S$ by the product metric on $M$ is precisely the metric of the sphere $S^{k}(a)$. We are asked to compute the Riemannian volume of this soul, which is the volume of the $k$-dimensional sphere of radius $a$, denoted $\\text{Vol}(S^{k}(a))$.\n\nThe volume of a $k$-dimensional sphere is related to the volume of the unit $k$-sphere, $\\text{Vol}(S^{k}(1))$, by a scaling factor. If the metric is scaled by a factor $c$, i.e., $g' = c g$, then in $k$ dimensions, the volume element is scaled by $\\sqrt{c^k} = c^{k/2}$ if $c$ is a constant. The metric on $S^k(a)$ is $a^2$ times the metric on $S^k(1)$. Thus, the volume form is scaled by $(a^2)^{k/2} = a^k$. Therefore, $\\text{Vol}(S^{k}(a)) = a^k \\text{Vol}(S^{k}(1))$.\n\nThe standard formula for the volume (or $k$-dimensional surface area) of a unit $k$-sphere is:\n$$\n\\text{Vol}(S^{k}(1)) = \\frac{2 \\pi^{\\frac{k+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k+1}{2}\\right)},\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\nCombining these results, the volume of the soul, $\\text{Vol}(S)$, is:\n$$\n\\text{Vol}(S) = \\text{Vol}(S^{k}(a)) = a^k \\frac{2 \\pi^{\\frac{k+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k+1}{2}\\right)}.\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the volume of the soul in terms of $k$ and $a$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a^{k} \\frac{2 \\pi^{\\frac{k+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k+1}{2}\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "3003848"}, {"introduction": "Major theorems in geometry often interact in profound ways, and understanding their scope is a critical skill.

If the sectional curvature is strictly positive everywhere, $K > 0$, then the soul $S$ must be a single point. In this case, the manifold $M^n$ is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of a point, which is simply the tangent space at that point, i.e., $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe problem considers a connected, complete, noncompact Riemannian manifold $M^{2k+1}$ of odd dimension $n=2k+1$ with strictly positive sectional curvature, $K>0$. By the aforementioned theorem, any such manifold $M^{2k+1}$ must be diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$.\n\nA manifold is orientable if it admits a nowhere-vanishing top-degree differential form (a volume form).

Since orientability is a topological property preserved by diffeomorphisms, it follows that any manifold $M^{2k+1}$ satisfying the given conditions must be orientable.\n\nThis fundamental result implies that no nonorientable, complete, noncompact, odd-dimensional manifold with $K>0$ can exist. The compactness assumption in Synge's theorem is thus not essential for the orientability conclusion in odd dimensions, although the reason is entirely different. Synge's theorem relies on the analysis of the holonomy group of a closed geodesic, which requires compactness, whereas the argument here relies on the global topological structure dictated by the soul theorem.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on this conclusion.\n\n**A. No such nonorientable example exists: every complete, noncompact Riemannian manifold with $K>0$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ and hence orientable; moreover, any isometry fixes the unique soul point, prohibiting any free, orientation-reversing isometric action, so no nonorientable quotient with $K>0$ can occur.**\n\nThis statement consists of several claims which we must validate.\n1.  \"every complete, noncompact Riemannian manifold with $K>0$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ and hence orientable\": As derived above from the Cheeger–Gromoll soul theorem, this is correct.\n2.  \"any isometry fixes the unique soul point\": Let $M$ be a complete, noncompact manifold with $K>0$. The soul, which is a point $p \\in M$, is unique. It can be characterized as the unique minimum of a certain smooth, strictly convex function on $M$ (the Busemann function or a similar construct). Let $\\phi: M \\to M$ be an isometry. An isometry preserves all geometric properties, so it must map the set of soul points to itself. Since this set contains only one point, $p$, we must have $\\phi(p) = p$. Thus, any isometry of $M$ must fix the soul point. This claim is correct.\n3.  \"prohibiting any free, orientation-reversing isometric action\": A group action is *free* if no group element other than the identity has any fixed points. Since every isometry of $M$ must fix the soul point $p$, no non-trivial isometry group can act freely on $M$.\n4.  \"so no nonorientable quotient with $K>0$ can occur\": A common method for constructing a nonorientable manifold is to take the quotient of an orientable manifold $M$ by a free, properly discontinuous group action $\\Gamma$ which contains at least one orientation-reversing element. The resulting quotient manifold $M/\\Gamma$ inherits a Riemannian metric with $K>0$ if the action is by isometries. However, since no such free action is possible on $M$, this construction method fails. It is impossible to form a quotient *manifold* with $K>0$ from such an $M$ that would be nonorientable.\n\nThe entire logical chain presented in this option is sound and follows directly from established theorems.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. The manifold $\\mathbb{R}\\mathrm{P}^{2k+1}\\setminus\\{p\\}$, endowed with the restriction of the round metric of constant curvature $K\\equiv 1$, is a complete, noncompact, nonorientable manifold with $K>0$.**\n\nLet $M = \\mathbb{R}\\mathrm{P}^{2k+1}\\setminus\\{p\\}$.\n1.  **Noncompact with $K>0$**: The real projective space $\\mathbb{R}\\mathrm{P}^{2k+1}$ with the round metric is compact and has constant sectional curvature $K \\equiv 1 > 0$. Removing a point $\\{p\\}$ makes the resulting space noncompact, and the restricted metric still has $K>0$. This part is correct.\n2.  **Nonorientable**: A real projective space $\\mathbb{R}\\mathrm{P}^n$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is odd. Therefore, $\\mathbb{R}\\mathrm{P}^{2k+1}$ is orientable. Removing a point from an orientable manifold results in an orientable manifold. Thus, $\\mathbb{R}\\mathrm{P}^{2k+1}\\setminus\\{p\\}$ is orientable. The claim that it is nonorientable is false.\n3.  **Complete**: A Riemannian manifold is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points converges to a point within the manifold.

Removing an open ball yields a noncompact manifold (a manifold with boundary) which inherits the property $K>0$. This is correct.\n2.  **Nonorientable**: The sphere $S^{n}$ is orientable for all $n \\ge 1$. Removing a ball from it produces a space diffeomorphic to a closed hemisphere, which is also orientable. The claim that it is nonorientable is false.\n3.  **Complete**: The resulting manifold with boundary is not complete as a Riemannian manifold. A sequence of points in $M$ converging to a point on the boundary $\\partial B(p, r)$ is a Cauchy sequence that does not converge to a point in the interior of $M$. Therefore, the manifold is not complete.\n\nThe option fails as the resulting manifold is orientable and not complete.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. There exists a rotationally symmetric complete metric with $K>0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ that is invariant under the antipodal map $x\\mapsto -x$, and the quotient by the induced free, properly discontinuous action gives a complete, nonorientable manifold with $K>0$.**\n\nThis option proposes a construction of a nonorientable example as a quotient.\n1.  **Existence of metric**: It is true that there exist complete metrics with $K>0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$. These are the \"soul metrics\" from the Cheeger-Gromoll theorem. A rotationally symmetric metric, e.g., $ds^2 = dr^2 + f(r)^2 d\\sigma_{2k}^2$, would be invariant under the orthogonal group $O(2k+1)$, which includes the antipodal map $A(x) = -x$. So, such an invariant metric exists.\n2.  **Free action**: The proposal requires that the action of the group $\\Gamma = \\{\\text{id}, A\\}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ endowed with this metric be free. However, the antipodal map has a fixed point: the origin, $A(0) = -0 = 0$. Therefore, the action is not free. A quotient of a manifold by an action that is not free is generally not a manifold itself, but an orbifold.\n3.  **Fundamental Contradiction**: The core premise of the option is that one can construct a complete, nonorientable manifold with $K>0$. As established in our initial analysis, the soul theorem proves this is impossible. The specific reason this construction fails is the lack of a free action. As established in the analysis of option A, any complete, noncompact manifold $M$ with $K>0$ must have a unique soul point fixed by all isometries. Therefore, it is impossible for any non-trivial group to act freely on $M$. The premise of a \"free... action\" is thus fundamentally flawed in this context.\n\nThe proposed construction is impossible because the required action cannot be free.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A is correct.

Let us analyze the chain of reasoning.\n1.  **Positive sectional curvature implies positive Ricci curvature**: The Ricci curvature $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v)$ for a unit vector $v \\in T_xM$ is the sum of the sectional curvatures of $n-1$ mutually orthogonal planes containing $v$. If $K(\\sigma,x) \\ge k > 0$ for all planes $\\sigma$, then $\\operatorname{Ric}(v,v) \\ge (n-1)k$. For a manifold of dimension $n \\ge 2$, this provides a uniform positive lower bound on the Ricci curvature.

This part of the statement is also correct.\n\nCombining these two facts, a complete manifold $(M,g)$ with a uniform positive lower bound on its sectional curvature, $K \\ge k > 0$, must be compact. It is therefore impossible for a noncompact manifold to satisfy this condition. Consequently, any sphere theorem for noncompact manifolds *must* relax the condition of a global, uniform positive lower bound on sectional curvature. The statement correctly identifies this fundamental obstruction.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. A lower sectional curvature bound only outside a compact set, together with asymptotic $\\dfrac{1}{4}$-pinching, suffices (via comparison geometry) to conclude that $M$ has one end and is diffeomorphic to $S^n$.**\n\nThis statement suffers from the same fundamental flaw as option A. It concludes that the noncompact manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to the compact sphere $S^n$. As established, this is topologically impossible. A noncompact manifold cannot be diffeomorphic to a compact one. While there are deep theorems (e.g., by Abresch, Gromoll, Perelman) that provide topological characterizations (such as being homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$) for noncompact manifolds with certain asymptotic curvature conditions, none can conclude a diffeomorphism to a compact manifold like $S^n$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. There exist complete, noncompact manifolds with $K\\ge 0$ and $K>0$ outside a compact set that are diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$, showing that asymptotic positivity at infinity does not yield spherical topology; thus compactness is essential in sphere-theorem conclusions.**\n\nThis statement makes an existence claim and draws a conclusion from it.\n1.  **Existence claim**: The Soul Conjecture, posed by Cheeger and Gromoll and later proven by Grigori Perelman, asserts that a complete, noncompact Riemannian manifold with non-negative sectional curvature ($K \\ge 0$) and sectional curvature being strictly positive at least at one point is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The condition \"$K > 0$ outside a compact set\" is a stronger version of \"$K>0$ at one point\". Thus, according to this celebrated theorem, such a manifold is indeed diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. A standard example is a paraboloid of revolution in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which has $K \\ge 0$ and is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This example has $K>0$ everywhere except the vertex, so it satisfies $K>0$ outside a compact set.\n2.  **Implication**: The existence of such manifolds (diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ but with positive curvature at infinity) serves as a powerful illustration that simply having positive curvature is not enough to force the topology of a sphere once the compactness assumption is dropped. The topology is that of Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^n$, not the sphere $S^n$.\n3.  **Conclusion**: This correctly implies that compactness is an essential hypothesis in the classical Sphere Theorem. Removing it, even while maintaining a strong positivity condition on curvature, fundamentally changes the resulting topology.\n\nThe entire statement is a correct and insightful summary of a key aspect of modern geometry.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2990859"}]}
