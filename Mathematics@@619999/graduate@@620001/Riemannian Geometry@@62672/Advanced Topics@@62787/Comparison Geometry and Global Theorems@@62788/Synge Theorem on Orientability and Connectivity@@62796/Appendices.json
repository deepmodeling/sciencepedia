It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in Riemannian geometry, providing all necessary definitions and constraints for a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to derive and solve the Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field on a space form of positive curvature, and then find the first conjugate time along a geodesic.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nLet $(M^{n}, g)$ be a complete, simply connected Riemannian space form of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa > 0$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a unit-speed geodesic in $M$. A Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nwhere $D/dt$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\nFor a space of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$, the curvature tensor has the specific form:\n$$\nR(X, Y)Z = \\kappa \\left( \\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y \\right)\n$$\nfor any vector fields $X$, $Y$, $Z$. We apply this formula to the Jacobi equation with $X=J$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\kappa \\left( \\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nWe are given two key properties. First, $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which means its velocity vector has a constant length of $1$. Thus, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, \\infty)$. Second, the Jacobi field $J$ is a normal Jacobi field, which by definition means it is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector at all times: $\\langle J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nSubstituting these two conditions into the expression for $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}$, we get:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\kappa \\left( (1) J - (0) \\dot{\\gamma} \\right) = \\kappa J\n$$\nNow, we substitute this simplified term back into the general Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + \\kappa J = 0\n$$\nThis is the ordinary differential equation satisfied by any normal Jacobi field along a geodesic in a space of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$.\n\n**Part 2: Explicit Solution of the Equation**\n\nTo solve this vector-valued linear differential equation, we introduce a suitable basis. Let $\\{E_1(0), \\dots, E_{n-1}(0)\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the $(n-1)$-dimensional vector space orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ at the point $\\gamma(0)$. We extend this to a frame field $\\{E_1(t), \\dots, E_{n-1}(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma$ by parallel transport, i.e., by defining $E_i(t) = P_{0 \\to t}(E_i(0))$, which implies $\\frac{D E_i}{dt} = 0$ for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. This frame forms an orthonormal basis for the subspace orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ for all $t$.\n\nSince $J(t)$ is a normal vector field, it can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} J^i(t) E_i(t)\n$$\nwhere $J^i(t) = \\langle J(t), E_i(t) \\rangle$ are the scalar component functions. Now we compute the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$. Using the product rule for covariant differentiation and the fact that the basis vector fields are parallel:\n$$\n\\frac{DJ}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{dJ^i}{dt} E_i(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} J^i(t) \\frac{DE_i}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{dJ^i}{dt} E_i(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{D^2J}{dt^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{d^2J^i}{dt^2} E_i(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into our derived ODE, $\\frac{D^2J}{dt^2} + \\kappa J = 0$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{d^2J^i}{dt^2} E_i(t) + \\kappa \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} J^i(t) E_i(t) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{d^2J^i}{dt^2} + \\kappa J^i \\right) E_i(t) = 0\n$$\nSince the vector fields $E_i(t)$ are linearly independent, each coefficient must be zero. This gives us $n-1$ identical scalar ODEs:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2J^i}{dt^2} + \\kappa J^i = 0, \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, n-1\n$$\nSince $\\kappa > 0$, the general solution for each component function $J^i(t)$ is that of a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$\nJ^i(t) = A_i \\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t) + B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)\n$$\nwhere $A_i$ and $B_i$ are constants of integration determined by the initial conditions.\n\nThe initial conditions are $J(0) = 0$ and $DJ/dt(0) = V$.\nFrom $J(0)=0$, we have $J^i(0) = 0$ for all $i$.\n$$\nJ^i(0) = A_i \\cos(0) + B_i \\sin(0) = A_i\n$$\nThus, we must have $A_i = 0$ for all $i$. The solution simplifies to $J^i(t) = B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)$.\n\nNext, we use the condition on the first derivative.\n$$\n\\frac{dJ^i}{dt} = B_i \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)\n$$\nAt $t=0$, we have $\\frac{dJ^i}{dt}(0) = B_i \\sqrt{\\kappa}$. The initial velocity vector $V$ is given as $DJ/dt(0)$, and its components in our basis at $t=0$ are $V^i = \\langle V, E_i(0) \\rangle$. Therefore,\n$$\nV^i = B_i \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\implies B_i = \\frac{V^i}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\n$$\nSubstituting $A_i$ and $B_i$ back gives the component solutions:\n$$\nJ^i(t) = \\frac{V^i}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)\n$$\nWe reconstruct the vector field $J(t)$:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} J^i(t) E_i(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{V^i}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t) \\right) E_i(t) = \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} V^i E_i(t)\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} V^i E_i(t)$ represents the parallel transport of the initial vector $V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} V^i E_i(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$. Let's denote this by $P_{0 \\to t}(V)$. The explicit construction of the Jacobi field is:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} P_{0 \\to t}(V)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: First Conjugate Time**\n\nA point $\\gamma(t)$ for $t>0$ is a conjugate point to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-zero Jacobi field $J$ along $\\gamma$ with $J(0) = 0$ that vanishes at $t$, i.e., $J(t)=0$.\nThe problem specifies that we seek such a field arising from a non-zero initial velocity $V$. This corresponds to a non-zero Jacobi field.\nFrom our constructed solution, for $J(t)$ to be zero, we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} P_{0 \\to t}(V) = 0\n$$\nWe are looking for a solution where the initial velocity $V$ is non-zero. Since $V$ is a vector in an $(n-1)$-dimensional space (with $n \\geq 2$), we can always choose $V \\neq 0$. Parallel transport is an isometry, so if $V \\neq 0$, then its parallel transport $P_{0 \\to t}(V)$ is also non-zero for all $t$.\nTherefore, for $J(t)$ to be zero, the scalar factor must be zero:\n$$\n\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t) = 0\n$$\nThis equation holds if $\\sqrt{\\kappa} t = k \\pi$ for any integer $k$. Solving for $t$, we get:\n$$\nt = \\frac{k\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the *first positive time* $t$ where this occurs. This corresponds to setting $k=1$.\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\n$$\nAt this time, $J(t) = 0$ for *any* choice of initial normal velocity $V$. The existence of a non-zero $V$ is guaranteed since the dimension of the normal space is $n-1 \\geq 1$. The result does not depend on the dimension $n$.\nThis time corresponds to the first conjugate point to $\\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}}$$", "id": "2992040"}, {"introduction": "The existence of conjugate points, which you explored in the previous practice, has a profound implication: the geodesic is no longer the shortest path between its endpoints.

We are asked to compute the index form $I(V,V)$ for a specific vector field $V$ along a closed geodesic $\\gamma$ on the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$ and to interpret the result in the context of Synge's theorem.\n\nThe index form is given by the formula:\n$$\nI(V,V) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\Big( \\langle D_{t} V, D_{t} V \\rangle - \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\Big) \\, dt\n$$\nWe are given several conditions on the vector field $V$ and the geodesic $\\gamma$.\n1. $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which implies $|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)| = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n2. $V$ is a parallel vector field along $\\gamma$, meaning its covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is zero: $D_{t} V = 0$.\n3. $V$ has unit length: $|V(t)| = 1$ for all $t$.\n4. $V$ is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector: $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nLet us first simplify the integrand using the given information.

The manifold is the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$ with its standard round metric, which is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor is given by the formula:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = K \\left( \\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, $K=1$, and we substitute $X=V$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\nR(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma} = 1 \\cdot \\left( \\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle V - \\langle V, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nWe can now use the properties of $\\gamma$ and $V$. Since $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = |\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Since $V$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, we have $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$. Substituting these into the expression for the curvature tensor gives:\n$$\nR(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma} = (1)V - (0)\\dot{\\gamma} = V\n$$\nNow we substitute this result back into the integrand for the index form:\n$$\n\\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle = \\langle V, V \\rangle\n$$\nSince $V$ is a unit vector field, we have $\\langle V(t), V(t) \\rangle = |V(t)|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.

Synge's theorem states that a compact, orientable, even-dimensional Riemannian manifold with strictly positive sectional curvature must be simply connected. A related result is that a compact, odd-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature must be orientable.\n\nThe core of the proof relies on the second variation of the energy functional, which is given by the index form. A geodesic is a critical point of the energy functional. If the second variation (the index form) can be made negative for some variation field, the geodesic is not a local minimum of energy (and therefore not a minimum of length). Such a geodesic is called unstable.\n\nOur calculation, $I(V,V) = -2\\pi < 0$, explicitly demonstrates that the great circle geodesic $\\gamma$ is unstable. The existence of even one such vector field $V$ for which the index form is negative implies that the index of the geodesic is at least $1$.\n\nThe argument for Synge's theorem for simple connectivity proceeds by contradiction. Assume $M$ is a compact, orientable, even-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature, but is *not* simply connected. Then there exists a non-trivial homotopy class of loops. In this class, there must be a loop of minimum length, which is a closed geodesic $\\gamma$. Because $M$ is orientable, one can construct a non-trivial periodic parallel vector field $V$ along $\\gamma$ that is everywhere orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ (as in this problem). The second variation formula for such a field in a positively curved space yields a negative value, as we have explicitly calculated for $S^n$. This implies that $\\gamma$ is not a true local minimum of length, contradicting the assumption that it was the shortest loop in its homotopy class. Therefore, no such non-trivial loop can exist, and the manifold must be simply connected ($\\pi_1(M) = \\{e\\}$).\n\nOur specific result $I(V,V) = -2\\pi$ provides a concrete calculation underpinning this fundamental argument in Riemannian geometry, showing how positive curvature forces global topological properties.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2\\pi}\n$$", "id": "2992056"}, {"introduction": "Having established the geometric intuition and the analytical machinery behind Synge's theorem, we can now apply it to test its predictive power on a fundamental example.

The function $f$ must be an odd function.\nHowever, we required $f$ to be a continuous (in fact, smooth) function that is nowhere zero. For $n \\ge 1$, $S^n$ is connected. If there exists a point $x_0 \\in S^n$ such that $f(x_0) > 0$, then $f(-x_0) = -f(x_0) < 0$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, any continuous path from $x_0$ to $-x_0$ on $S^n$ must contain a point $y$ where $f(y) = 0$. This contradicts the requirement that $f$ is nowhere zero. Therefore, no such function $f$ exists. This implies that for even $n$, no volume form on $S^n$ can descend to $\\mathbb{RP}^n$, and thus $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is non-orientable.\n\nFinally, we connect this to Synge's theorem. A version of Synge's theorem states that if $M$ is a compact, connected Riemannian manifold with strictly positive sectional curvature, and its dimension is odd, then $M$ must be orientable.\n\nThe sphere $S^n$ with the round metric has constant positive sectional curvature $K=1$. The quotient map $\\pi: S^n \\to \\mathbb{RP}^n$ is a local isometry, so $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ inherits a Riemannian metric with constant positive sectional curvature $K=1$. $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is also compact and connected.\n- If $n$ is odd, $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is an odd-dimensional, compact, connected manifold with positive sectional curvature. Synge's theorem predicts that it must be orientable. Our calculation, showing that $s(n)=(-1)^{n+1}=1$ for odd $n$, confirms this prediction by allowing for the construction of a volume form on $\\mathbb{RP}^n$.\n- If $n$ is even, $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is even-dimensional. Synge's theorem does not make a claim about its orientability. Our calculation shows that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is non-orientable for even $n$. This result is consistent with Synge's theorem, as the theorem provides a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for orientability that does not apply in this case. Indeed, $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ for even $n$ is a canonical example illustrating that the theorem's conclusion for orientable even-dimensional manifolds does not apply.\n\nThe final answer requested is the single closed-form expression for $s(n)$.\nWe found $s(n) = (-1)^{n+1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(-1)^{n+1}}\n$$", "id": "2992072"}]}
