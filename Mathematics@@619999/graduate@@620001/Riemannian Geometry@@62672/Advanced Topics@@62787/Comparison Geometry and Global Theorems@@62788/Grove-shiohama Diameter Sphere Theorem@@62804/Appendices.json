We can represent these points by their position vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which are unit vectors. Let's denote these vectors as $\\mathbf{p}$, $\\mathbf{q}$, and $\\mathbf{r}$, such that $||\\mathbf{p}|| = ||\\mathbf{q}|| = ||\\mathbf{r}|| = 1$.\n\nThe Riemannian distance $d(x,y)$ between two points $x,y \\in \\mathbb{S}^2$ is given as the angle between their position vectors.

The angle between vectors $\\mathbf{q}$ and $\\mathbf{r}$ is $a$.\n$$a = \\arccos(\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\implies \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} = \\cos(a)$$\nThe side of length $b=d(p,r)$ is opposite vertex $q$.

This vector is found by projecting $\\mathbf{p}$ onto the tangent space at $r$, $T_r\\mathbb{S}^2$. This is equivalent to taking the component of $\\mathbf{p}$ that is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{r}$.

This is precisely the angle $\\gamma$ we have just found. To find $\\gamma$ itself, we take the arccosine of the expression above. Since $\\gamma$ is an interior angle of a non-degenerate geodesic triangle, its value lies in the interval $(0, \\pi)$, which is within the principal range of the arccosine function, $[0, \\pi]$. The triangle inequalities for spherical geometry ensure that the argument of the arccosine is in $[-1,1]$.\nTherefore, we can write $\\gamma$ as a function of the side lengths $a, b, c$:\n$$\\gamma = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\cos(c) - \\cos(a)\\cos(b)}{\\sin(a)\\sin(b)}\\right)$$\nThis defines the requested comparison-angle function $\\Gamma(a,b,c)$.\n$$\\Gamma(a,b,c) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\cos(c) - \\cos(a)\\cos(b)}{\\sin(a)\\sin(b)}\\right)$$\nThis formula provides the angle at the vertex formed by the sides of length $a$ and $b$, which is the angle opposite the side of length $c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\cos(c) - \\cos(a)\\cos(b)}{\\sin(a)\\sin(b)}\\right)}$$", "id": "2978081"}, {"introduction": "The proofs of diameter sphere theorems often proceed by contradiction, demonstrating that assuming a manifold is not a sphere leads to an impossible geometric configuration.

The theorem concerns complete Riemannian manifolds $M$ with sectional curvature $K_M \\ge 1$.\n\nThe cornerstone of the argument is Toponogov's comparison theorem. For a geodesic triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in $M$ and its comparison triangle $\\Delta \\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r}$ in $S^2$ (the space of constant curvature $1$), the theorem states that the angles of the triangle in $M$ are greater than or equal to the corresponding angles of the comparison triangle in $S^2$.\nFor the angle at vertex $p$, this means:\n$$\\angle qpr \\ge \\angle_p = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$\nSince the cosine is negative, we have $\\angle_p > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This result indicates that the minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$ and from $p$ to $r$ must form an obtuse angle at $p$. This required \"wideness\" is a significant geometric constraint on the manifold $M$.\n\nTo fully appreciate how this leads to a contradiction, we must analyze the entire comparison triangle. Let us compute the other two angles, at vertices $\\tilde{q}$ and $\\tilde{r}$. Let $\\angle_q$ (denoted $B$) be the angle at $\\tilde{q}$ and $\\angle_r$ (denoted $C$) be the angle at $\\tilde{r}$.\nBy the spherical law of cosines for angle $B$:\n$$\\cos(B) = \\frac{\\cos(b) - \\cos(a)\\cos(c)}{\\sin(a)\\sin(c)} = \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)}$$\n$$\\cos(B) = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} - (0)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{(1)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nSo, $\\angle_q = B = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$. Since the triangle is isosceles with $b=c$, the angle at $\\tilde{r}$ is the same: $\\angle_r = C = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we examine the sum of the angles of the comparison triangle, $S_{S^2} = A+B+C$:\n$$S_{S^2} = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + 2 \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nLet $\\alpha = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$ and $\\beta = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$. We have $\\alpha \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$ and $\\beta \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)$.

The angle $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ for which $\\cos(\\theta) = -1/3$ is $\\theta = 2\\pi - \\arccos(-1/3) = 2\\pi - \\alpha$.\nTherefore, $2\\beta = 2\\pi - \\alpha$, which implies $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 2\\pi$.\nThe sum of the angles of the comparison triangle is exactly $2\\pi$.\n\nBy Toponogov's theorem, the sum of the angles of the geodesic triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in $M$, denoted $S_M$, must satisfy:\n$$S_M = \\angle qpr + \\angle pqr + \\angle prq \\ge A+B+C = 2\\pi$$\nThe rigidity case of Toponogov's theorem states that if the equality $S_M = S_{S^2}$ holds, then the triangle $\\Delta pqr$ must be isometric to the comparison triangle $\\Delta \\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r}$, and the region it bounds must be a totally geodesic surface of constant curvature $1$.\nThe condition $S_M \\ge 2\\pi$ for a geodesic triangle is exceptionally restrictive. It implies that the equality must hold, $S_M = 2\\pi$, and therefore the triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in $M$ must be isometric to a spherical triangle whose vertices' angle sum is $2\\pi$. By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a spherical triangle, Area $= (\\text{Sum of angles}) - \\pi$. The area of our comparison triangle is $2\\pi - \\pi = \\pi$.\n\nThe existence of such a \"maximal\" triangle, which is a rigid, totally geodesic hemisphere of radius $1$, places an enormous constraint on the structure of $M$. In the proof of the Grove-Shiohama theorem, one argues that if $M$ were not homeomorphic to a sphere, certain geometric configurations could be constructed. The analysis above shows that a configuration of three points with the given pairwise distances is impossible in a manifold with $K_M \\ge 1$ unless it contains a totally geodesic hemisphere. The ability to force such rigid structures to appear is a central tool in demonstrating that the manifold must globally have a simple topology, i.e., that of a sphere.

Let $p, q \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{n}$. By definition of the quotient space, we can write $p = \\pi(x)$ and $q = \\pi(y)$ for some representatives $x, y \\in S^{n}$.\n\nThe definition of the Riemannian distance $d_{h}(p,q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all smooth curves connecting $p$ and $q$:\n$$\nd_{h}(p,q) = \\inf\\{L_{h}(\\gamma) : \\gamma:[0,1] \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{n} \\text{ is a smooth curve with } \\gamma(0)=p \\text{ and } \\gamma(1)=q\\}.\n$$\nThe map $\\pi: (S^{n},g_{1}) \\to (\\mathbb{RP}^{n},h)$ is a Riemannian covering map. A key property of covering maps is the path lifting property. For any smooth curve $\\gamma:[0,1] \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ starting at $p=\\pi(x)$, and for any choice of point $\\tilde{x}_{0}$ in the fiber $\\pi^{-1}(p)$, there exists a unique lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}:[0,1] \\to S^{n}$ such that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = \\tilde{x}_{0}$ and $\\pi \\circ \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$.\n\nThe fiber over $p=\\pi(x)$ is $\\pi^{-1}(p) = \\{x, -x\\}$. Let us choose the starting point of our lift to be $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = x$. Since $\\gamma(1) = q = \\pi(y)$, the endpoint of the lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)$ must lie in the fiber over $q$, which is $\\pi^{-1}(q) = \\{y, -y\\}$. Thus, any smooth curve from $p$ to $q$ in $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ lifts to a smooth curve in $S^{n}$ that starts at $x$ and ends at either $y$ or $-y$.\n\nCrucially, the metric $h$ on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is defined such that $\\pi$ is a local isometry. This means that the length of a curve in $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is identical to the length of its lift in $S^{n}$:\n$$\nL_{h}(\\gamma) = L_{g_{1}}(\\tilde{\\gamma}).\n$$\nCombining these facts, we can express the distance $d_{h}(p,q)$ by taking the infimum over the lengths of the lifted curves in $S^{n}$:\n$$\nd_{h}(p,q) = \\inf \\{L_{g_{1}}(\\tilde{\\gamma}) : \\tilde{\\gamma} \\text{ is a smooth curve in } S^n \\text{ with } \\tilde{\\gamma}(0)=x \\text{ and } \\tilde{\\gamma}(1) \\in \\{y, -y\\} \\}.\n$$\nThe set of curves under consideration can be partitioned into two sets: those ending at $y$ and those ending at $-y$.

If $x,y \\in S^n$, then $d_{g_{1}}(x,y) = \\arccos(x \\cdot y)$. The distance to the antipode $-y$ is $d_{g_{1}}(x,-y) = \\arccos(x \\cdot (-y)) = \\arccos(-x \\cdot y)$. Using the identity $\\arccos(-t) = \\pi - \\arccos(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $d_{g_{1}}(x,-y) = \\pi - d_{g_{1}}(x,y)$.

Since every pair of points $(p,q)$ in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ can be represented by $(\\pi(x), \\pi(y))$ for some $x, y \\in S^n$, the supremum is taken over all such pairs:\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}\\!(\\mathbb{RP}^{n},h) = \\sup_{x,y \\in S^{n}} \\left\\{ \\min\\left(d_{g_{1}}(x,y), \\pi - d_{g_{1}}(x,y)\\right) \\right\\}.\n$$\nLet $d = d_{g_{1}}(x,y)$.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the function $f(d) = \\min(d, \\pi-d)$ for $d \\in [0, \\pi]$.\n\nWe analyze the function $f(d)$:\n- If $0 \\le d \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $d \\le \\pi - d$, so $f(d) = d$.\n- If $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < d \\le \\pi$, then $d > \\pi - d$, so $f(d) = \\pi - d$.\n\nThe function $f(d)$ increases linearly from $0$ to $\\pi/2$ on the interval $[0, \\pi/2]$ and decreases linearly from $\\pi/2$ to $0$ on the interval $[\\pi/2, \\pi]$. The maximum value of $f(d)$ is therefore attained at $d = \\pi/2$, and this maximum value is $\\pi/2$.\n\nThis supremum is achievable. For any point $x \\in S^{n}$, we can always find a point $y \\in S^{n}$ such that the great-circle distance is exactly $\\pi/2$ (e.g., any point on the equator if $x$ is a pole). Therefore, the supremum is a maximum.\nThe diameter of $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n},h)$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.\n\n(c) The Grove–Shiohama diameter sphere theorem states that if $(M, g)$ is a complete, connected $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $\\sec(M) \\ge 1$ and diameter $\\operatorname{diam}(M) > \\pi/2$, then $M$ is homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere $S^n$.\n\nLet us examine the manifold $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n},h)$ in light of this theorem, for $n>1$.\n1.  **Curvature:** The covering map $\\pi: (S^n, g_1) \\to (\\mathbb{RP}^n, h)$ is a local isometry. Since the sectional curvature of $(S^n, g_1)$ is identically $1$, and sectional curvature is a local invariant, the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{RP}^n, h)$ is also identically $1$. Thus, the condition $\\sec_{h} \\ge 1$ is satisfied.\n2.  **Completeness & Connectivity:** As a compact manifold, $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is complete. It is also connected.\n3.  **Diameter:** From part (b), we computed $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{RP}^{n},h) = \\pi/2$.\n\nThe manifold $(\\mathbb{RP}^{n},h)$ satisfies $\\sec_h \\geq 1$ and $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{RP}^n,h) = \\pi/2$. This value for the diameter does *not* satisfy the strict inequality $\\operatorname{diam} > \\pi/2$ of the theorem.\n\nNow we check the conclusion of the theorem for $\\mathbb{RP}^n$. For $n>1$, the real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is not homeomorphic to the sphere $S^n$. A fundamental topological distinction is that $S^n$ is simply connected for $n>1$ (its fundamental group is trivial, $\\pi_1(S^n)=\\{e\\}$), whereas $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is not simply connected (its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{RP}^n) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$). Since homeomorphic spaces must have isomorphic fundamental groups, $S^n$ and $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ cannot be homeomorphic for $n > 1$.\n\nTherefore, $(\\mathbb{RP}^n, h)$ (for $n > 1$) provides a family of counterexamples to what the theorem would state if its diameter hypothesis were weakened to $\\operatorname{diam} \\ge \\pi/2$. The existence of this manifold, which meets the proposed weakened condition $\\operatorname{diam} \\ge \\pi/2$ but fails the \"homeomorphic to a sphere\" conclusion, demonstrates that the constant $\\pi/2$ is the sharpest possible and that the strict inequality is essential.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2978075"}]}
