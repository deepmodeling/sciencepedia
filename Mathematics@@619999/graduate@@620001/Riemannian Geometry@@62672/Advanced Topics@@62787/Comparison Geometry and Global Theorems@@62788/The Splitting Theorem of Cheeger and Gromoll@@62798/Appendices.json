No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. We will address each part sequentially, using the provided definitions and first principles.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $\\Delta r(x)$\n\nThe radial distance function is given by $r(x) = \\|x\\| = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right)^{1/2}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The Laplace operator is defined as $\\Delta u = \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla u)$. We first compute the gradient of $r(x)$.\n\nThe $k$-th component of the gradient $\\nabla r(x)$ is given by the partial derivative with respect to $x_k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right)^{-1/2} (2x_k) = \\frac{x_k}{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right)^{1/2}} = \\frac{x_k}{r(x)}\n$$\nThus, the gradient vector field is $\\nabla r(x) = \\frac{x}{r(x)}$. This is the unit radial vector field, often denoted $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\n\nNext, we compute the divergence of $\\nabla r(x)$. The divergence of a vector field $F = (F_1, \\dots, F_n)$ is $\\operatorname{div}(F) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial F_k}{\\partial x_k}$. Here, $F_k(x) = \\frac{x_k}{r(x)}$.\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\left(\\frac{x_k}{r(x)}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial x_k}{\\partial x_k} \\cdot r(x) - x_k \\cdot \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x_k}}{r(x)^2} = \\frac{1 \\cdot r(x) - x_k \\left(\\frac{x_k}{r(x)}\\right)}{r(x)^2} = \\frac{r(x) - \\frac{x_k^2}{r(x)}}{r(x)^2} = \\frac{r(x)^2 - x_k^2}{r(x)^3}\n$$\nNow, we sum over all components $k$ from $1$ to $n$ to find the divergence:\n$$\n\\Delta r(x) = \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla r(x)) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\left(\\frac{x_k}{r(x)}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{r(x)^2 - x_k^2}{r(x)^3}\n$$\nWe can factor out the denominator and split the sum:\n$$\n\\Delta r(x) = \\frac{1}{r(x)^3} \\sum_{k=1}^n (r(x)^2 - x_k^2) = \\frac{1}{r(x)^3} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n r(x)^2 - \\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2 \\right)\n$$\nBy definition, $\\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2 = r(x)^2$. The first sum is over a constant term, so $\\sum_{k=1}^n r(x)^2 = n \\cdot r(x)^2$. Substituting these into the expression:\n$$\n\\Delta r(x) = \\frac{1}{r(x)^3} (n \\cdot r(x)^2 - r(x)^2) = \\frac{(n-1)r(x)^2}{r(x)^3} = \\frac{n-1}{r(x)}\n$$\nSo, for $x \\neq 0$, the Laplacian of the radial distance function is $\\Delta r = \\frac{n-1}{r}$.\n\nPart 2: Busemann function analysis\n\nWe are given the unit-speed geodesic ray $\\gamma(t) = x_0 + tv$ with $\\|v\\|=1$. The function $u_t(x)$ is defined as $u_t(x) = d(x, \\gamma(t)) - t$.\n\nFirst, we compute $\\Delta u_t(x)$. Let $y_t = \\gamma(t)$. The function $u_t(x)$ can be written as $u_t(x) = \\|x - y_t\\| - t$. The Laplacian is translation-invariant. Let $z = x - y_t$. A change of variables from $x$ to $z$ does not change the Laplacian operator, i.e., $\\Delta_x = \\Delta_z$. The function $\\|x-y_t\\|$ is just the radial distance function centered at $y_t$. Therefore, we can apply the result from Part 1.\n$$\n\\Delta_x (\\|x - y_t\\|) = \\frac{n-1}{\\|x - y_t\\|} = \\frac{n-1}{d(x, \\gamma(t))}\n$$\nThe function $u_t(x)$ is $u_t(x) = d(x, \\gamma(t)) - t$. The term $-t$ is a constant with respect to $x$, so its Laplacian is zero.\n$$\n\\Delta u_t(x) = \\Delta (d(x, \\gamma(t))) - \\Delta(t) = \\frac{n-1}{d(x, \\gamma(t))} - 0 = \\frac{n-1}{d(x, \\gamma(t))}\n$$\nThis holds for $x \\neq \\gamma(t)$.\n\nNext, we compute the pointwise limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\Delta u_t(x)$. We need to analyze the behavior of $d(x, \\gamma(t))$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t)) = \\|x - \\gamma(t)\\| = \\|x - (x_0 + tv)\\| = \\|(x - x_0) - tv\\|\n$$\nThe squared distance is:\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t))^2 = \\|(x - x_0) - tv\\|^2 = \\|x-x_0\\|^2 - 2t\\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle + t^2\\|v\\|^2\n$$\nSince $\\|v\\|=1$, this is $d(x, \\gamma(t))^2 = t^2 - 2t\\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle + \\|x-x_0\\|^2$. For a fixed $x$, as $t \\to \\infty$, the $t^2$ term dominates, so $d(x, \\gamma(t)) \\to \\infty$. Consequently, the limit of the Laplacian is:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\Delta u_t(x) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{n-1}{d(x, \\gamma(t))} = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we compute $\\Delta b_{\\gamma}(x)$ directly. First, we find an explicit expression for the Busemann function $b_{\\gamma}(x) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (d(x, \\gamma(t)) - t)$.\nUsing the expression for $d(x, \\gamma(t))^2$:\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t)) = \\sqrt{t^2 - 2t\\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle + \\|x-x_0\\|^2} = t \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2\\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle}{t} + \\frac{\\|x-x_0\\|^2}{t^2}}\n$$\nUsing the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+z} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}z + O(z^2)$ for small $z$, we set $z = -\\frac{2\\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle}{t} + \\frac{\\|x-x_0\\|^2}{t^2}$.\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma(t)) = t \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\frac{2\\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle}{t} + O\\left(\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) \\right) + O\\left(\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) \\right) = t - \\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle + O\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)\n$$\nNow we compute the limit for $b_{\\gamma}(x)$:\n$$\nb_{\\gamma}(x) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left( t - \\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle + O\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) \\right) - t \\right) = -\\langle x-x_0, v \\rangle\n$$\nThis can be written as $b_{\\gamma}(x) = -\\langle x, v \\rangle + \\langle x_0, v \\rangle$. This is an affine function of $x$. The term $\\langle x_0, v \\rangle$ is a constant, and the term $-\\langle x, v \\rangle = -\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i v_i$ is a linear function of $x$.\n\nWe compute the Laplacian of $b_{\\gamma}(x)$:\n$$\n\\Delta b_{\\gamma}(x) = \\Delta(-\\langle x, v \\rangle + \\langle x_0, v \\rangle) = -\\Delta(\\langle x, v \\rangle) + \\Delta(\\langle x_0, v \\rangle)\n$$\nThe term $\\langle x_0, v \\rangle$ is constant with respect to $x$, so its Laplacian is $0$. For the term $\\langle x, v \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\langle x, v \\rangle) = \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla(\\langle x, v \\rangle))\n$$\nFirst, the gradient:\n$$\n\\nabla(\\langle x, v \\rangle) = \\nabla\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i v_i\\right)\n$$\nThe $k$-th component of this gradient is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i v_i\\right) = v_k$, since the components $v_i$ of the vector $v$ are constants. So, $\\nabla(\\langle x, v \\rangle) = v$.\nNext, the divergence:\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}(v) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial x_k} = \\sum_{k=1}^n 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, $\\Delta b_{\\gamma}(x) = -0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nFinally, we verify that $\\Delta b_{\\gamma}(x)$ equals the limit we found. We have $\\Delta b_{\\gamma}(x) = 0$ and we found $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\Delta u_t(x) = 0$. The equality holds. This calculation illustrates how geometric quantities associated with expanding geodesic spheres (level sets of $d(x, \\gamma(t))$) converge to those of the corresponding horosphere (level set of $b_{\\gamma}(x)$), which in Euclidean space is a hyperplane and thus has a Laplacian (mean curvature) of $0$.\n\nThe two analytic expressions required are $\\Delta r(x) = \\frac{n-1}{r}$ and $\\Delta b_{\\gamma}(x) = 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{n-1}{r} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3004423"}, {"introduction": "Having established the baseline in flat space, we now investigate why the non-negative Ricci curvature condition is essential by turning to its opposite: hyperbolic space ($H^n$).

It only depends on the $z$ coordinate, which is expected as the geodesic $\\gamma$ is vertical and the horospheres are horizontal planes.\n\n**2. Proof that $b_{\\gamma}$ is $1$-Lipschitz**\n\nA function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold is $1$-Lipschitz if its gradient has unit norm, i.e., $|\\nabla f|_g = 1$. Let's compute the norm of the gradient of $b_{\\gamma}(x,z) = -\\ln(z)$. The gradient covector is $\\nabla b_{\\gamma} = d(-\\ln z) = (0, \\dots, 0, -1/z)$. The metric tensor is $g_{ij} = z^{-2}\\delta_{ij}$ and its inverse is $g^{ij} = z^2\\delta_{ij}$. The squared norm of the gradient is:\n$$|\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g^2 = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^j}$$\nSince $b_\\gamma$ depends only on $z$ (let's denote it $x^n$), the only non-zero partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{z}$.\n$$|\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g^2 = g^{zz} \\left(\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 = z^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{z}\\right)^2 = z^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{z^2}\\right) = 1$$\nSince $|\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g = 1$ everywhere, the function $b_{\\gamma}$ is $1$-Lipschitz. For any two points $p, q$ connected by a unit-speed geodesic $c(s)$ of length $L=d_g(p,q)$, we have:\n$$|b_{\\gamma}(q) - b_{\\gamma}(p)| = \\left|\\int_0^L \\frac{d}{ds}b_{\\gamma}(c(s)) ds\\right| = \\left|\\int_0^L \\langle \\nabla b_{\\gamma}(c(s)), c'(s) \\rangle_g ds\\right|$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|\\langle \\nabla b_{\\gamma}, c' \\rangle_g| \\le |\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g |c'|_g = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n$$|b_{\\gamma}(q) - b_{\\gamma}(p)| \\le \\int_0^L 1 ds = L = d_g(p,q)$$\nThis confirms that $b_{\\gamma}$ is $1$-Lipschitz.\n\n**3. Computation and Interpretation of the Laplacian $\\Delta b_{\\gamma}$**\n\nThe Laplacian of a function $f$ in local coordinates is given by $\\Delta f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det g}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left(\\sqrt{\\det g} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}\\right)$.\nFor the metric $g_{ij} = z^{-2}\\delta_{ij}$ in $n$ dimensions, $\\det g = (z^{-2})^n = z^{-2n}$, so $\\sqrt{\\det g} = z^{-n}$.\nOur function is $b_{\\gamma}(z) = -\\ln(z)$. The gradient vector field components are $V^i = g^{ij}\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^j}$. The only non-zero component is for the $z$ coordinate (denoted by index $n$):\n$$V^n = g^{nn} \\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial z} = z^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{z}\\right) = -z$$\nAll other components $V^i=0$ for $i < n$. The Laplacian calculation simplifies to a single term:\n$$\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det g}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(\\sqrt{\\det g} V^n\\right) = z^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(z^{-n}(-z)\\right) = z^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(-z^{-n+1}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = z^n \\left(-(-n+1)z^{-n+1-1}\\right) = z^n \\left((n-1)z^{-n}\\right) = n-1$$\nThe Laplacian of the Busemann function is the constant value $\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = n-1$.\n\n**Interpretation and Connection to the Splitting Theorem:**\n\nThe Cheeger-Gromoll Splitting Theorem is a foundational result for manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature ($\\text{Ric} \\ge 0$). It states that a complete manifold with $\\text{Ric} \\ge 0$ that contains a line (a doubly-infinite distance-minimizing geodesic) must isometrically split as a product $M \\cong N \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nA key step in the proof involves showing that the Busemann functions associated with the line are harmonic, i.e., their Laplacian is zero. This follows from the Bochner formula:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta(|\\nabla f|^2) = |\\nabla^2 f|^2 + \\text{Ric}(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) + \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle$$\nFor a Busemann function $b$, $|\\nabla b|_g^2=1$, so the left side is $0$. If we assume $\\text{Ric} \\ge 0$, the Bochner formula becomes $0 = |\\nabla^2 b|^2 + \\text{Ric}(\\nabla b, \\nabla b) + \\langle \\nabla b, \\nabla(\\Delta b) \\rangle$. A deeper analysis shows this forces $\\Delta b = 0$.\n\nIn our case, $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=-1$, and its Ricci curvature is strictly negative: $\\text{Ric} = -(n-1)g$. The Busemann function $b_{\\gamma} = -\\ln(z)$ is not harmonic; its Laplacian is $\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = n-1$. This value is positive for $n \\ge 2$, meaning $b_\\gamma$ is strictly subharmonic.\n\nThis result perfectly illustrates why the Splitting Theorem does not apply to manifolds with negative curvature. Let's verify the Bochner formula for our function $b_\\gamma$.\n- $|\\nabla b_\\gamma|_g^2 = 1$, so $\\Delta(|\\nabla b_\\gamma|_g^2) = 0$.\n- $\\Delta b_\\gamma = n-1$, which is constant, so $\\nabla(\\Delta b_\\gamma) = 0$.\n- $\\text{Ric}(\\nabla b_\\gamma, \\nabla b_\\gamma) = -(n-1)g(\\nabla b_\\gamma, \\nabla b_\\gamma) = -(n-1)|\\nabla b_\\gamma|_g^2 = -(n-1)$.\n- It can be shown that $|\\nabla^2 b_\\gamma|^2 = n-1$.\nThe Bochner formula becomes $0 = (n-1) + (-(n-1)) + 0$, which is consistent.\n\nThe non-zero, positive Laplacian $\\Delta b_\\gamma = n-1$ is a direct consequence of the negative Ricci curvature. The term $\\text{Ric}(\\nabla b_\\gamma, \\nabla b_\\gamma) = -(n-1)$ is negative, which forces the Hessian term $|\\nabla^2 b_\\gamma|^2$ to be positive. A non-zero Hessian means the gradient field $\\nabla b_\\gamma$ is not parallel, and the function $b_\\gamma$ is not harmonic. Geometrically, $\\Delta b_\\gamma$ represents the mean curvature of the level sets of $b_\\gamma$ (the horospheres). The value $n-1$ shows that these horospheres are not minimal surfaces, as they would be in the case of non-negative Ricci curvature. Thus, the harmonicity feature required for the splitting argument is absent in hyperbolic space, and this is fundamentally due to its negative curvature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n-1}$$", "id": "3004376"}, {"introduction": "The Cheeger-Gromoll theorem is a statement about the global structure of a manifold, and such results often depend crucially on the hypothesis of completeness.

A line is a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to M$ such that $d(\\gamma(s),\\gamma(t))=\\lvert t-s\\rvert$ for all $s,t\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\nGlobal splitting results in Riemannian geometry, such as the Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem, use global existence of certain geodesics and potential functions built from them, together with curvature inequalities. Your task is to identify how completeness enters these arguments and to illustrate, by a specific noncomplete example, that without completeness the splitting conclusion can fail even if the other hypotheses are satisfied.\nWhich option correctly explains the role of completeness and gives a valid noncomplete counterexample where all other assumptions (connectedness, $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$, and existence of a line) hold but the isometric product decomposition fails? Assume $n\\ge 2$ whenever $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is mentioned. Exactly one option is correct.\n\nA. Completeness guarantees that every maximal geodesic, in particular a line, is defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ and that minimizing geodesic rays to infinity exist from any point, so that Busemann functions are globally well defined and enjoy the convexity and regularity properties needed to build a parallel vector field and integrate it to a global product. Without completeness, these constructions can break. For instance, $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ with the Euclidean metric has $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ and contains a line (e.g., $\\gamma(t)=p+tv$ with $\\langle p,v\\rangle=0$ and $\\|v\\|=1$), but it is not complete (geodesics aiming at $0$ have finite length) and $M$ does not split isometrically as $\\mathbb{R}\\times N$; in particular, in polar coordinates the metric is $dr^{2}+r^{2}g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$, which is a cone, not a product, and there is no globally defined complete unit vector field whose flow lines through every point remain in $M$ for all time.\n\nB. Completeness is not needed: if $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ and there is a line, one already gets a product splitting. As a counterexample to the necessity of completeness, take the open half-space $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\\times (0,\\infty)$ with the Euclidean metric; it has $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ and contains lines parallel to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, but it does not split isometrically as a product with $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nC. Completeness is essential because otherwise one cannot guarantee existence of minimizing geodesics at all. For a counterexample, take the open unit ball $B_{1}(0)\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the Euclidean metric; it has $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ and contains a line, but it does not split as a product.\n\nD. Completeness can be dropped because polar coordinates already exhibit the splitting in many cases: for $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ with the Euclidean metric, one has an isometry with $\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ using $r=\\exp(t)$, so the space splits isometrically even though it is not complete.", "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation of the role of completeness in the Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem and for a valid counterexample illustrating the failure of the theorem's conclusion when completeness is dropped. The theorem states that a complete, connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with non-negative Ricci curvature, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, which contains a line, must be isometrically a product $M \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\times N$, where $N$ is also a complete manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$.\n\nLet us analyze the standard proof of this theorem to understand the role of completeness. Given a line $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\to M$, one defines two Busemann functions:\n$$ b^+(x) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (d(x, \\gamma(t)) - t) $$\n$$ b^-(x) = \\lim_{t \\to -\\infty} (d(x, \\gamma(t)) + t) $$\nCompleteness of $(M,g)$ is essential for the following steps:\n$1$. The Hopf-Rinow theorem equates geodesic completeness with metric completeness, which ensures that for any two points, there exists a minimizing geodesic connecting them. More importantly for the Busemann function construction, completeness guarantees the existence of at least one geodesic ray emanating from any point $x \\in M$.\n$2$. With the assumption $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, a key result from comparison geometry (the Laplacian comparison theorem) shows that the Busemann functions $b^+$ and $b^-$ are subharmonic, meaning their Laplacians are non-negative ($\\Delta b^\\pm \\ge 0$) in a distributional sense. Consequently, the function $h(x) = b^+(x) + b^-(x)$ is also subharmonic.\n$3$. By the triangle inequality, $h(x) = b^+(x) + b^-(x) \\ge 0$. Along the line $\\gamma$ itself, one can show $h(\\gamma(t)) = 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$4$. Here, a crucial argument enters: the maximum principle for non-compact manifolds. For a non-negative subharmonic function on a complete manifold, if it attains its minimum value of 0, it must be constant (and thus identically zero). This is a powerful result due to Calabi and generalized by Yau. Since $h(x)$ is non-negative and is zero on the line $\\gamma$, it satisfies these conditions. Completeness is the key hypothesis for this version of the maximum principle to hold. This allows the conclusion that $h(x) \\equiv 0$ on all of $M$.\n$5$. The condition $h(x) \\equiv 0$ implies that for any point $x\\in M$, the geodesic rays realizing the Busemann functions piece together to form a new line passing through $x$. This structure is then used to show that the vector field $V = \\nabla b^+$ is parallel. The flow of this complete, parallel vector field gives the desired isometric splitting $M \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\times N$. Completeness of $M$ is required to ensure the flow is complete, i.e., defined for all time, which is necessary for a global isometry.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Completeness guarantees that every maximal geodesic, in particular a line, is defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ and that minimizing geodesic rays to infinity exist from any point, so that Busemann functions are globally well defined and enjoy the convexity and regularity properties needed to build a parallel vector field and integrate it to a global product. Without completeness, these constructions can break. For instance, $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ with the Euclidean metric has $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ and contains a line (e.g., $\\gamma(t)=p+tv$ with $\\langle p,v\\rangle=0$ and $\\|v\\|=1$), but it is not complete (geodesics aiming at $0$ have finite length) and $M$ does not split isometrically as $\\mathbb{R}\\times N$; in particular, in polar coordinates the metric is $dr^{2}+r^{2}g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$, which is a cone, not a product, and there is no globally defined complete unit vector field whose flow lines through every point remain in $M$ for all time.**\n\nThis option provides a correct explanation of the role of completeness, aligning with the proof outline above. It correctly identifies the necessity of minimizing rays for the properties of Busemann functions. Let us verify the counterexample $M = \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ for $n \\ge 2$ with the Euclidean metric.\n- **Connected**: Yes, for $n \\ge 2$.\n- **$\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$**: Yes, the metric is flat, so $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$.\n- **Contains a line**: Yes. Any straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that does not pass through the origin is a line in $M$. For instance, $\\gamma(t)=(1, t, 0, \\dots, 0)$ is a unit-speed geodesic in $M$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and is globally distance-minimizing, so it is a line.\n- **Not complete**: Yes. The manifold is not geodesically complete. For example, the geodesic $\\eta(t)=(1-t, 0, \\dots, 0)$ starting at $(1, 0, \\dots, 0)$ cannot be extended past $t=1$, as it \"hits\" the missing point at the origin.\n- **Does not split as $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$**: The metric in polar coordinates $(r, \\omega) \\in (0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is $g = dr^2 + r^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$. This is a warped product, not an isometric product. In an isometric product $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$, the metric would take the form $dt^2 + g_N$, where the metric on $N$ is independent of the $\\mathbb{R}$ coordinate. Here, the metric on the $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ component, $r^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$, depends on the radial coordinate $r$. Therefore, $M$ does not split isometrically.\n\nThe explanation and the counterexample are both valid.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Completeness is not needed: if $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ and there is a line, one already gets a product splitting. As a counterexample to the necessity of completeness, take the open half-space $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\\times (0,\\infty)$ with the Euclidean metric; it has $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ and contains lines parallel to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, but it does not split isometrically as a product with $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n\nThe initial assertion that completeness is not needed is false; it is a critical hypothesis of the Cheeger–Gromoll theorem. The conclusion of the theorem includes the completeness of the factor $N$, which cannot be guaranteed without the completeness of $M$. Let's analyze the proposed \"counterexample\" $M = \\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \\times (0, \\infty) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. It is connected, non-complete, has $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$, and contains lines (e.g., parallel to the $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ factor). However, the statement claims it \"does not split isometrically\". This is false. The space $M$ is isometrically a product. For instance, it is isometric to $\\mathbb{R} \\times N$ where $N$ is the half-space $\\mathbb{R}^{n-2} \\times (0, \\infty)$. The isometry simply identifies the first coordinate of $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ with the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor. So, the space *does* split isometrically. The example is invalid for its stated purpose.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Completeness is essential because otherwise one cannot guarantee existence of minimizing geodesics at all. For a counterexample, take the open unit ball $B_{1}(0)\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the Euclidean metric; it has $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ and contains a line, but it does not split as a product.**\n\nThe explanation is imprecise. On any Riemannian manifold, minimizing geodesics exist locally. Completeness guarantees the existence of a minimizing geodesic between *any* two points.\nThe counterexample is invalid. Let $M = B_1(0) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. This manifold is bounded. A line is a geodesic $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\to M$. In $M$, geodesics are straight line segments. A geodesic defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ must be unbounded. Therefore, the bounded manifold $B_1(0)$ cannot contain a line. The proposed counterexample fails to satisfy the hypothesis of containing a line.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Completeness can be dropped because polar coordinates already exhibit the splitting in many cases: for $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ with the Euclidean metric, one has an isometry with $\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ using $r=\\exp(t)$, so the space splits isometrically even though it is not complete.**\n\nThis option contains a critical mathematical error. The space is $M = \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. In polar coordinates, its metric is $g=dr^2 + r^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$. The change of variables $r=e^t$ gives $dr = e^t dt$. Substituting this into the metric yields:\n$$ g = (e^t dt)^2 + (e^t)^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} = e^{2t}(dt^2 + g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}) $$\nThis metric is for the manifold $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. The term $e^{2t}$ is a warping factor. This metric is *conformal* to the product metric $dt^2 + g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$, but it is not *isometric* to it. An isometry would require the metric to separate into a part depending only on $t$ and a part depending only on the coordinates of $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, without cross-terms or a global scaling factor that depends on $t$. Therefore, the claim that $M$ splits isometrically is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that provides a correct theoretical explanation and a valid, fully checked counterexample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2983373"}]}
