As $J$ is a complex structure, it is skew-adjoint with respect to the metric, meaning $\\langle JX, Y \\rangle = -\\langle X, JY \\rangle$ for any vectors $X, Y$. This implies $\\langle Jv, v \\rangle = -\\langle v, Jv \\rangle = -\\langle Jv, v \\rangle$, so $\\langle Jv, v \\rangle = 0$. Also, we have $\\langle u, Jv \\rangle = -\\langle Ju, v \\rangle$.

The complex dimension $m$ of $\\mathbb{C}P^m$ is crucial here.\n\nCase 1: $m=1$.\n$\\mathbb{C}P^1$ is isometric to the $2$-sphere $S^2$. The tangent space at any point is $2$-dimensional. Thus, any $2$-plane $\\sigma$ is the tangent space itself.
