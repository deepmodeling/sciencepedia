The theorem requires three conditions to hold for a connected Riemannian manifold $M$:\n1. $M$ is complete.\n2. $M$ has non-positive sectional curvature.\n3. $M$ is simply connected.\n\nLet's examine each of these conditions for the given manifold $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the sectional curvature. The problem states that $M$ is equipped with the standard flat product metric. A \"flat\" Riemannian manifold is one where the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, the sectional curvature $K$, which is derived from the curvature tensor, is also identically zero for all 2-dimensional subspaces of any tangent space. Since $K=0$, the condition of non-positive sectional curvature ($K \\le 0$) is satisfied everywhere. This eliminates option B, which incorrectly claims the existence of positive curvature.\n\nSecond, we consider completeness. The problem statement asserts that the manifold is complete. To verify this, we can think about geodesics on the cylinder. The universal cover of the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and the covering map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a local isometry. Geodesics in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are straight lines, which can be extended indefinitely in both directions. The geodesics on the cylinder are the projections of these straight lines. Since the geodesics in the covering space are complete, the geodesics on the cylinder are also complete. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a manifold on which all geodesics can be extended for all values of their parameter is a complete metric space. Therefore, $M$ is complete. This eliminates option A. The completeness of $M$ also implies, by the Hopf-Rinow theorem, that the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_pM \\to M$ is defined on the entire tangent space for any $p \\in M$, which eliminates option E.\n\nThird, we examine the simple-connectedness of $M$. A space is simply connected if it is path-connected and its fundamental group is trivial. The manifold $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is clearly path-connected. To find its fundamental group, we use the property that the fundamental group of a product of spaces is the product of their individual fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(A \\times B) \\cong \\pi_1(A) \\times \\pi_1(B)$.\nIn our case, $A = S^1$ (the circle) and $B = \\mathbb{R}$ (the real line).\nThe fundamental group of the circle is the group of integers, $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is because of the existence of non-contractible loops that wind around the circle.\nThe real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is a contractible space, so its fundamental group is the trivial group, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\{0\\}$.\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the cylinder is $\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince the fundamental group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not the trivial group, the manifold $M$ is not simply connected. This is the hypothesis of the Cartan-Hadamard theorem that fails. This makes option C the correct answer.\n\nFinally, option D is incorrect because the problem statement explicitly defines $M$ as a Riemannian manifold by equipping it with a metric.\n\nIn summary, the cylinder $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a complete, connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature, but it is not simply connected.

Its sectional curvature must be non-positive everywhere ($K \\le 0$).\n\nLet's examine each of these conditions for the standard $n$-sphere $S^n$ with its round metric.\n\n**Condition 1: Completeness**\nA fundamental result in Riemannian geometry is that any compact Riemannian manifold is also a complete manifold. The $n$-sphere $S^n$ is defined as a closed and bounded subset of Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. By the Heine-Borel theorem, this means $S^n$ is compact. Therefore, $S^n$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. This means statement A is incorrect.\n\n**Condition 2: Simply Connected**\nA space is simply connected if its fundamental group is trivial. For the $n$-sphere, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^n)$ is trivial if and only if $n \\ge 2$. Since the problem explicitly states that we are considering the case where $n \\ge 2$, the $n$-sphere is indeed simply connected.

This means statement B is incorrect.\n\n**Condition 3: Non-positive Sectional Curvature**\nThe standard $n$-sphere of radius $R=1$ is a classic example of a space with constant curvature. For any point on $S^n$ and any 2-dimensional plane in its tangent space, the sectional curvature $K$ is constant and positive, given by the formula $K = 1/R^2$. In our case, $R=1$, so the sectional curvature is $K = +1$. The condition for a Cartan-Hadamard manifold requires the sectional curvature to be non-positive, i.e., $K \\le 0$. Since the sectional curvature of $S^n$ is strictly positive ($K=+1$), this condition is violated. This is the reason why $S^n$ is not a Cartan-Hadamard manifold.

The standard round metric on $S^n$ is a well-defined, non-degenerate Riemannian metric at every point. Confusion on this point sometimes arises from certain coordinate systems (like spherical coordinates) having singularities at the poles, but the metric tensor itself is smooth and non-degenerate everywhere when considered properly (e.g., as an induced metric from $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$).\n\nStatement E is nonsensical.

We will derive expressions for the gradient $\\nabla f$ and the Hessian $\\operatorname{Hess} f$, and then justify the positive semidefiniteness of $\\operatorname{Hess} f$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Gradient $\\nabla f$**\n\nThe function $f$ is a composition of the squaring function and the distance function $r$. Using the chain rule for differentiation, the differential of $f$ is:\n$$df = d(r^2) = 2r dr$$\nThe Riemannian gradient $\\nabla f$ at a point $x \\in M$ is defined as the unique vector field such that for any vector $v \\in T_xM$, the following relation holds:\n$$g_x(\\nabla f(x), v) = df_x(v)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $df$, we have:\n$$g_x(\\nabla f(x), v) = 2r(x) dr_x(v)$$\nBy the definition of the gradient of $r$, we know that $dr_x(v) = g_x(\\nabla r(x), v)$. Therefore:\n$$g_x(\\nabla f(x), v) = 2r(x) g_x(\\nabla r(x), v)$$\nSince this equation must hold for all $v \\in T_xM$, and the metric $g_x$ is non-degenerate, we can conclude that the vector fields are equal:\n$$\\nabla f(x) = 2r(x) \\nabla r(x)$$\nFor a point $x \\ne p$, the vector field $\\nabla r$ is the unit tangent vector to the unique minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $x$. In normal coordinates, this corresponds to the radial direction, often denoted $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Hessian $\\operatorname{Hess} f$**\n\nThe Riemannian Hessian of a function $h$ is the $(0,2)$-tensor field $\\operatorname{Hess} h = \\nabla (dh)$, defined by its action on vector fields $X$ and $Y$:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} h)(X, Y) = (\\nabla_X dh)(Y)$$\nWe apply this definition to $f$, with $df = 2r dr$. We use the product rule for the covariant derivative of a tensor product, where one factor is a function (a $(0,0)$-tensor) and the other is a $1$-form (a $(0,1)$-tensor):\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} f)(X, Y) = (\\nabla_X (2r dr))(Y) = (X(2r))dr(Y) + 2r(\\nabla_X dr)(Y)$$\nThe first term simplifies as $X(2r) = 2X(r) = 2dr(X)$. The second term, $(\\nabla_X dr)(Y)$, is by definition the Hessian of $r$, denoted $(\\operatorname{Hess} r)(X, Y)$.\nSubstituting these into the expression, we get:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} f)(X, Y) = 2dr(X)dr(Y) + 2r(\\operatorname{Hess} r)(X, Y)$$\nThis expression holds for any pair of vector fields $X, Y$. In tensor notation, this can be written as:\n$$\\operatorname{Hess} f = 2 dr \\otimes dr + 2r \\operatorname{Hess} r$$\nThis provides the Hessian of $f$ in terms of $r$, its differential $dr$, and its Hessian $\\operatorname{Hess} r$.\n\n**3. Positive Semidefiniteness of $\\operatorname{Hess} f$**\n\nTo justify that $\\operatorname{Hess} f$ is positive semidefinite for $x \\ne p$ when $\\operatorname{sec} \\le 0$, we need to show that $(\\operatorname{Hess} f)_x(v,v) \\ge 0$ for all $v \\in T_xM$. From the derived expression:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} f)_x(v,v) = 2(dr_x(v))^2 + 2r(x)(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v)$$\nThe first term, $2(dr_x(v))^2$, is always non-negative. For $x \\ne p$, we have $r(x) = d(p,x) > 0$. Thus, the positive semidefiniteness of $\\operatorname{Hess} f$ depends on the sign of $(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v)$. We now show that the condition $\\operatorname{sec} \\le 0$ implies that $\\operatorname{Hess} r$ is positive semidefinite.\n\nLet $\\gamma: [0, l] \\to M$ be the unique, unit-speed, minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $x$, with $l=r(x)$. The gradient $\\nabla r(x)$ is the tangent vector $\\gamma'(l)$. We analyze $(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v)$ by decomposing $v$ into components parallel and orthogonal to $\\nabla r(x)$. Let $v = a\\nabla r(x) + w$, where $g_x(\\nabla r(x), w) = 0$. Using bilinearity:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v) = a^2 (\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(\\nabla r, \\nabla r) + 2a(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(\\nabla r, w) + (\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(w, w)$$\nBy definition, $(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(X, Y) = g_x(\\nabla_X \\nabla r, Y)$. Since $\\nabla r$ is the tangent field of a family of geodesics, it is a geodesic field, meaning $\\nabla_{\\nabla r} \\nabla r = 0$. Therefore:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(\\nabla r, \\nabla r) = g_x(\\nabla_{\\nabla r} \\nabla r, \\nabla r) = 0$$\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(\\nabla r, w) = g_x(\\nabla_{\\nabla r} \\nabla r, w) = 0$$\nThus, the Hessian of $r$ depends only on the component of $v$ orthogonal to the radial direction:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v) = (\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(w,w)$$\nTo evaluate this term, we use Jacobi fields. Let $J(s)$ be the unique Jacobi field along the geodesic $\\gamma(s)$ satisfying the initial conditions $J(0) = 0$ and $J(l) = w$. Since $w \\perp \\gamma'(l)$, and $(M,g)$ is a Hadamard manifold (so no conjugate points), we can choose this Jacobi field to be orthogonal to $\\gamma(s)$ for all $s \\in [0,l]$. The Jacobi field equation along $\\gamma$ is:\n$$J''(s) + R(J(s), \\gamma'(s))\\gamma'(s) = 0$$\nwhere the double prime denotes the second covariant derivative along $\\gamma$. A fundamental result relating the Hessian to Jacobi fields states that for $w \\perp \\gamma'(l)$:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(w,w) = g_l(J'(l), J(l))$$\nLet us define the function $u(s) = g_s(J'(s), J(s))$ for $s \\in [0,l]$. We want to show that $u(l) \\ge 0$. We compute its derivative:\n$$u'(s) = \\frac{d}{ds}g_s(J'(s), J(s)) = g_s(J''(s), J(s)) + g_s(J'(s), J'(s))$$\nSubstituting the Jacobi equation:\n$$u'(s) = -g_s(R(J(s), \\gamma'(s))\\gamma'(s), J(s)) + |J'(s)|_s^2$$\nThe sectional curvature of the plane spanned by $\\{J(s), \\gamma'(s)\\}$ is given by $\\operatorname{sec}_s = \\frac{g_s(R(J(s), \\gamma'(s))\\gamma'(s), J(s))}{|J(s)|_s^2 |\\gamma'(s)|_s^2}$. Since $\\gamma$ is unit-speed and $J \\perp \\gamma'$, this simplifies to $\\operatorname{sec}_s = \\frac{g_s(R(J(s), \\gamma'(s))\\gamma'(s), J(s))}{|J(s)|_s^2}$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$u'(s) = |J'(s)|_s^2 - |J(s)|_s^2 \\operatorname{sec}_s$$\nThe problem states that the sectional curvature is non-positive, $\\operatorname{sec} \\le 0$. Therefore, $-\\operatorname{sec}_s \\ge 0$, which implies:\n$$u'(s) \\ge |J'(s)|_s^2 \\ge 0$$\nThis shows that $u(s)$ is a non-decreasing function on $[0,l]$. The value at $s=0$ is $u(0)=g_0(J'(0), J(0))$. Since $J(0)=0$, we have $u(0)=0$. As $u(s)$ is non-decreasing, we must have $u(l) \\ge u(0) = 0$.\nWe have thus shown $(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(w,w) = u(l) \\ge 0$. This implies $(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v) \\ge 0$ for any $v \\in T_xM$, so $\\operatorname{Hess} r$ is positive semidefinite.\n\nFinally, we return to the Hessian of $f$:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} f)_x(v,v) = 2(dr_x(v))^2 + 2r(x)(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v)$$\nSince $(dr_x(v))^2 \\ge 0$, $r(x) > 0$ for $x \\ne p$, and $(\\operatorname{Hess} r)_x(v,v) \\ge 0$, we conclude that:\n$$(\\operatorname{Hess} f)_x(v,v) \\ge 0$$\nThis confirms that the Hessian of the squared distance function, $f(x) = d^2(p,x)$, is positive semidefinite on a Hadamard manifold for all $x \\ne p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\pmatrix{\n2r\\nabla r & 2 dr \\otimes dr + 2r \\operatorname{Hess} r\n}\n}\n$$", "id": "2993189"}]}
