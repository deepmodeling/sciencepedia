This means that for small radii $s$, the volume of a geodesic ball behaves like the volume of a Euclidean ball of the same radius. The volume of a Euclidean ball of radius $s$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $\\Omega_n s^n$, where $\\Omega_n = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(n/2+1)}$.

Similarly, for the model space, $V_{k}(A_{k}(r,R)) = V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - V_{k}(B_{k}(r))$. Note that since $R>r>0$, this volume is positive.\nThe ratio $\\mu_{p}(r,R)$ can be expressed in terms of the function $f_p(s)$:\n$$\n\\mu_{p}(r,R) = \\frac{V(A(p,r,R))}{V_{k}(A_{k}(r,R))} = \\frac{V(B(p,R)) - V(B(p,r))}{V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - V_{k}(B_{k}(r))} = \\frac{f_{p}(R)V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - f_{p}(r)V_{k}(B_{k}(r))}{V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - V_{k}(B_{k}(r))}.\n$$\nBy the Bishop–Gromov theorem, $f_{p}(s)$ is nonincreasing, so for $0 < r < R$, we have $f_{p}(R) \\leq f_{p}(r)$. We can use this to bound the numerator:\n$$\nf_{p}(R)V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - f_{p}(r)V_{k}(B_{k}(r)) \\leq f_{p}(r)V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - f_{p}(r)V_{k}(B_{k}(r)) = f_{p}(r)\\left(V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - V_{k}(B_{k}(r))\\right).\n$$\nSince $V_{k}(A_k(r,R)) = V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - V_{k}(B_{k}(r)) > 0$, we can divide by it without changing the inequality:\n$$\n\\mu_{p}(r,R) \\leq \\frac{f_{p}(r)\\left(V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - V_{k}(B_{k}(r))\\right)}{V_{k}(B_{k}(R)) - V_{k}(B_{k}(r))} = f_{p}(r).\n$$\nAs we established earlier, $f_p(r) \\leq 1$ for all $p \\in M$ and $r>0$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mu_{p}(r,R) \\leq 1.\n$$\nThis provides an upper bound for the ratio that is uniform in the center $p$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of the limit $L(r,R)$**\n\nWe need to evaluate the limit\n$$\nL(r,R) := \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\sup_{p \\in M} \\frac{V(A(p,tr,tR))}{V_{k}(A_{k}(tr,tR))}.\n$$\nLet us denote the quantity inside the supremum by $\\mu_{p}(tr,tR)$. From Part 1, we have shown that $\\mu_{p}(s_1, s_2) \\leq 1$ for any radii $0 < s_1 < s_2$. Setting $s_1=tr$ and $s_2=tR$, this gives $\\mu_{p}(tr,tR) \\leq 1$ for all $p \\in M$ and $t > 0$.\nTaking the supremum over all $p \\in M$, we find\n$$\n\\sup_{p \\in M} \\mu_{p}(tr,tR) \\leq 1.\n$$\nTaking the limit as $t \\to 0^{+}$ on both sides, we obtain\n$$\nL(r,R) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\sup_{p \\in M} \\mu_{p}(tr,tR) \\leq 1.\n$$\n\nTo find the value of the limit, we now establish a lower bound. For any fixed point $p \\in M$, let's analyze the behavior of $\\mu_{p}(tr,tR)$ as $t \\to 0^{+}$. In normal coordinates at $p$, the metric is Euclidean to first order, which implies that the volume of a thin annulus is asymptotically the same as in Euclidean space. More formally, the volume of the annulus $A(p,tr,tR)$ can be approximated as:\n$$\nV(A(p,tr,tR)) = \\int_{tr}^{tR} \\mathrm{Area}(S(p,\\rho)) d\\rho.\n$$\nFor small $\\rho$, the area of a geodesic sphere $S(p,\\rho)$ is $\\mathrm{Area}(S(p,\\rho)) = \\omega_{n-1}\\rho^{n-1}(1+O(\\rho^2))$, where $\\omega_{n-1}$ is the volume of the unit $(n-1)$-sphere.\nThus,\n$$\nV(A(p,tr,tR)) = \\int_{tr}^{tR} \\omega_{n-1}\\rho^{n-1} d\\rho + O(t^{n+2}) = \\omega_{n-1}\\frac{(tR)^n - (tr)^n}{n} + O(t^{n+2}) = \\Omega_n t^n(R^n-r^n) + O(t^{n+2}).\n$$\nThe exact same reasoning applies to the model space $M_k^n$, giving $V_k(A_k(tr,tR)) = \\Omega_n t^n(R^n-r^n) + O(t^{n+2})$.\nThe ratio for a fixed point $p$ therefore has the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\mu_{p}(tr,tR) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\Omega_n t^n(R^n-r^n) + O(t^{n+2})}{\\Omega_n t^n(R^n-r^n) + O(t^{n+2})} = 1.\n$$\nThis shows that for every $p \\in M$, the function $t \\mapsto \\mu_p(tr,tR)$ converges to $1$ as $t \\to 0^+$. Thus, $\\liminf_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\mu_p(tr,tR) = 1$ for all $p \\in M$.\n\nNow we use the general property of limits, often called the \"liminf sup\" inequality: for any function $F(t,p)$,\n$$\n\\liminf_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\sup_{p \\in M} F(t,p) \\geq \\sup_{p \\in M} \\liminf_{t \\to 0^{+}} F(t,p).\n$$\nApplying this to $F(t,p) = \\mu_p(tr,tR)$:\n$$\n\\liminf_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\sup_{p \\in M} \\mu_p(tr,tR) \\geq \\sup_{p \\in M} \\left( \\liminf_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\mu_p(tr,tR) \\right) = \\sup_{p \\in M} (1) = 1.\n$$\nSo we have shown:\n$$\n\\limsup_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\sup_{p \\in M} \\mu_p(tr,tR) \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\liminf_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\sup_{p \\in M} \\mu_p(tr,tR) \\geq 1.\n$$\nThese two conditions together imply that the limit exists and is equal to $1$.\n\nTherefore, $L(r,R) = 1$.

By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, any compact Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete. Thus, $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$ is complete.\n2.  **Ricci Curvature**: For a Riemannian $n$-manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann curvature tensor is given by $R(X,Y)Z = K(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y)$. The Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,Y) = \\operatorname{tr}(Z \\mapsto R(Z,X)Y)$.

For $n \\ge 2$, the Ricci curvature is strictly positive.\n3.  **Existence of a Line**: A line must be a geodesic that is minimizing for all time. Geodesics on $S^n$ are great circles. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a geodesic on $S^n$ with unit speed. After traveling a distance of $\\pi$ (the radius of $S^n$ is $1$), the geodesic reaches the point antipodal to its starting point.

Therefore, it is complete. Alternatively, since the universal covering map $\\pi: (\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}) \\to (T^n, g_{\\mathrm{flat}})$ is a local isometry and the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is complete, the base space $T^n$ must also be complete.\n2.  **Ricci Curvature**: The metric on $T^n$ is induced from the Euclidean metric on its universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Curvature is a local property. Since $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is flat ($R=0$), its Ricci tensor is also zero. Thus, the flat torus is Ricci-flat, $\\operatorname{Ric}=0$, which satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$.\n3.  **Existence of a Line**: Like the sphere, the torus $T^n$ is a compact manifold. It has a finite diameter. Therefore, it cannot contain a line, for the same reason given for $S^n$. A line requires points arbitrarily far apart, which is impossible. To be more explicit, a geodesic $\\gamma$ on $T^n$ is the projection of a straight line $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = p+tv$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The distance on the torus is $d_{T^n}(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)) = \\min_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} d_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(\\tilde{\\gamma}(s), \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)+z) = \\min_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} \\|(s-t)v - z\\|$.

So the Ricci curvature is nonnegative.\n3.  **Existence of a Line**: Consider a curve $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $\\gamma(t)=(p_0, t)$ for a fixed point $p_0 \\in S^{n-1}$. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = (0, 1)$, which has unit length. Since the components of the Christoffel symbols mixing the two factors are zero, a curve is a geodesic if and only if its projections onto the factor manifolds are geodesics. The projection to $S^{n-1}$ is a constant point, which is a trivial geodesic (zero velocity), and the projection to $\\mathbb{R}$ is the line $t \\mapsto t$, which is a geodesic. Hence, $\\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic.\n    The distance between two points $\\gamma(s)=(p_0, s)$ and $\\gamma(t)=(p_0, t)$ is given by:\n    $$\n    d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t))^2 = d_{S^{n-1}}(p_0, p_0)^2 + d_{\\mathbb{R}}(s, t)^2 = 0^2 + (s-t)^2 = (s-t)^2\n    $$\n    Taking the square root, we get $d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)) = |s-t|$. This is the definition of a line. Thus, $S^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ contains lines.\n\nConclusion for (D): The manifold is complete and has $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, but it contains lines. It does not match the criteria.\n\nSummary:\n- (A) $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$: Yes (Complete, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, no lines).\n- (B) $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$: No (Contains lines).\n- (C) $(T^n, g_{\\mathrm{flat}})$: Yes (Complete, $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, no lines).\n- (D) $(S^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}, g_{\\mathrm{round}} \\oplus g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$: No (Contains lines).\n\nThe options that satisfy all required conditions are A and C.\n\nOption-by-option analysis verdict:\nA. $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$: **Correct**. It is complete, has $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$, and contains no lines due to its compactness.\nB. $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$: **Incorrect**.
