The problem asks for the application of the Toponogov triangle comparison theorem to a specific geodesic triangle on the unit $2$-sphere $S^2$ and its comparison triangle in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, followed by a precise calculation of the difference in the lengths of their third sides.\n\nThe Toponogov triangle comparison theorem is a central result in Riemannian geometry that relates the geometry of a manifold to the geometry of a model space of constant curvature. Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $K$ satisfying $K \\ge \\kappa$ for some constant $\\kappa \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let $M_{\\kappa}$ be the simply connected $2$-dimensional space form with constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$. Given a geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ in $M$ with vertices $p, q, r$ and side lengths $d(p,q)$, $d(q,r)$, $d(r,p)$, a comparison triangle $\\bar{\\Delta}$ in $M_{\\kappa}$ with vertices $\\bar{p}, \\bar{q}, \\bar{r}$ can be constructed such that two side lengths and the included angle are identical, e.g., $d(p,q) = d(\\bar{p},\\bar{q})$, $d(p,r) = d(\\bar{p},\\bar{r})$, and the angle at $p$ equals the angle at $\\bar{p}$. The theorem states that the length of the third side of the triangle in $M$ is less than or equal to the length of the third side of the comparison triangle in $M_{\\kappa}$, i.e., $d(q,r) \\le d(\\bar{q},\\bar{r})$.\n\nIn this problem, the manifold is the unit $2$-sphere, $M = S^2$, which has constant sectional curvature $K=1$. The comparison space is the Euclidean plane, $M_0 = \\mathbb{R}^2$, which has constant sectional curvature $\\kappa=0$. Since $K=1 \\ge \\kappa=0$, the condition for the theorem is met.\n\nWe are given a geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ on $S^2$ with side lengths $a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $b = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and an included angle $\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The length of the side opposite the angle $\\gamma$ is denoted by $c$. The comparison triangle $\\Delta_0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has side lengths $a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, $b = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and the same included angle $\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The length of the side opposite $\\gamma$ in $\\Delta_0$ is denoted by $c_0$. According to the Toponogov theorem, we have the relationship $c \\le c_0$. The problem requires the computation of the exact difference $c_0 - c$.\n\nTo find $c_0$ and $c$, we use the law of cosines appropriate for each space, which is a quantitative characterization of these constant curvature geometries.\n\nFirst, we compute the length $c_0$ in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The law of cosines in Euclidean geometry states:\n$$c_0^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(\\gamma)$$\nSubstituting the given values $a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, $b = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, and $\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n$$c_0^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$$\n$$c_0^2 = 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{9}\\right) - 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{9}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$c_0^2 = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{9}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$c_0^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{9}(2 - \\sqrt{2})$$\nSince $c_0$ is a length, it must be positive. Taking the square root gives:\n$$c_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi^2}{9}(2 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nNext, we compute the length $c$ on the unit sphere $S^2$. The lengths of the sides of the geodesic triangle are measured as angles subtended at the center of the sphere, and the spherical law of cosines for sides relates them:\n$$\\cos(c) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) + \\sin(a)\\sin(b)\\cos(\\gamma)$$\nThis formula is specific to a sphere of radius $R=1$. Substituting the given values $a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, $b = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, and $\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n$$\\cos(c) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$$\nWe use the standard values $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$:\n$$\\cos(c) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\cos(c) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\cos(c) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{8}$$\n$$\\cos(c) = \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{8} = \\frac{2 + 3\\sqrt{2}}{8}$$\nThe length $c$ is then found by taking the inverse cosine. The side lengths $a, b$ are less than $\\pi$, so the triangle is contained in a hemisphere and the side $c$ is uniquely determined and must be in the interval $(0, \\pi)$.\n$$c = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{2 + 3\\sqrt{2}}{8}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $c_0 - c$ as requested.\n$$c_0 - c = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} - \\arccos\\left(\\frac{2 + 3\\sqrt{2}}{8}\\right)$$\nThis is the final exact analytic expression for the difference in lengths.

The validation confirms that the problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, as the given side lengths satisfy the triangle inequalities for a spherical triangle.\n\nFirst, we compute the angle $\\angle_p$ in the comparison triangle on the unit $2$-sphere, $S^2$. Let the vertices of the comparison triangle in $S^2$ be $\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}, \\tilde{r}$. The side lengths of this triangle are given by the distances in the manifold $M$:\n$a = d(\\tilde{q}, \\tilde{r}) = d(q,r) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n$b = d(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{r}) = d(p,r) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$\n$c = d(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}) = d(p,q) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$\nThe angle $\\angle_p$ is the angle at vertex $\\tilde{p}$, which we shall denote as $A$.

The theorem concerns complete Riemannian manifolds $M$ with sectional curvature $K_M \\ge 1$.\n\nThe cornerstone of the argument is Toponogov's comparison theorem. For a geodesic triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in $M$ and its comparison triangle $\\Delta \\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r}$ in $S^2$ (the space of constant curvature $1$), the theorem states that the angles of the triangle in $M$ are greater than or equal to the corresponding angles of the comparison triangle in $S^2$.\nFor the angle at vertex $p$, this means:\n$$\\angle qpr \\ge \\angle_p = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$\nSince the cosine is negative, we have $\\angle_p > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This result indicates that the minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$ and from $p$ to $r$ must form an obtuse angle at $p$. This required \"wideness\" is a significant geometric constraint on the manifold $M$.\n\nTo fully appreciate how this leads to a contradiction, we must analyze the entire comparison triangle. Let us compute the other two angles, at vertices $\\tilde{q}$ and $\\tilde{r}$. Let $\\angle_q$ (denoted $B$) be the angle at $\\tilde{q}$ and $\\angle_r$ (denoted $C$) be the angle at $\\tilde{r}$.\nBy the spherical law of cosines for angle $B$:\n$$\\cos(B) = \\frac{\\cos(b) - \\cos(a)\\cos(c)}{\\sin(a)\\sin(c)} = \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)}$$\n$$\\cos(B) = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} - (0)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{(1)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nSo, $\\angle_q = B = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$. Since the triangle is isosceles with $b=c$, the angle at $\\tilde{r}$ is the same: $\\angle_r = C = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we examine the sum of the angles of the comparison triangle, $S_{S^2} = A+B+C$:\n$$S_{S^2} = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + 2 \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nLet $\\alpha = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$ and $\\beta = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.

The angle $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ for which $\\cos(\\theta) = -1/3$ is $\\theta = 2\\pi - \\arccos(-1/3) = 2\\pi - \\alpha$.\nTherefore, $2\\beta = 2\\pi - \\alpha$, which implies $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 2\\pi$.\nThe sum of the angles of the comparison triangle is exactly $2\\pi$.\n\nBy Toponogov's theorem, the sum of the angles of the geodesic triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in $M$, denoted $S_M$, must satisfy:\n$$S_M = \\angle qpr + \\angle pqr + \\angle prq \\ge A+B+C = 2\\pi$$\nThe rigidity case of Toponogov's theorem states that if the equality $S_M = S_{S^2}$ holds, then the triangle $\\Delta pqr$ must be isometric to the comparison triangle $\\Delta \\tilde{p}\\tilde{q}\\tilde{r}$, and the region it bounds must be a totally geodesic surface of constant curvature $1$.\nThe condition $S_M \\ge 2\\pi$ for a geodesic triangle is exceptionally restrictive. It implies that the equality must hold, $S_M = 2\\pi$, and therefore the triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in $M$ must be isometric to a spherical triangle whose vertices' angle sum is $2\\pi$. By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a spherical triangle, Area $= (\\text{Sum of angles}) - \\pi$. The area of our comparison triangle is $2\\pi - \\pi = \\pi$.\n\nThe existence of such a \"maximal\" triangle, which is a rigid, totally geodesic hemisphere of radius $1$, places an enormous constraint on the structure of $M$. In the proof of the Grove-Shiohama theorem, one argues that if $M$ were not homeomorphic to a sphere, certain geometric configurations could be constructed. The analysis above shows that a configuration of three points with the given pairwise distances is impossible in a manifold with $K_M \\ge 1$ unless it contains a totally geodesic hemisphere. The ability to force such rigid structures to appear is a central tool in demonstrating that the manifold must globally have a simple topology, i.e., that of a sphere. Thus, the calculation of $\\angle_p$ is the first step in uncovering the extreme nature of the specified triangle, which serves as a \"contradiction triangle\" in the broader argument.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}$$", "id": "2978085"}]}
