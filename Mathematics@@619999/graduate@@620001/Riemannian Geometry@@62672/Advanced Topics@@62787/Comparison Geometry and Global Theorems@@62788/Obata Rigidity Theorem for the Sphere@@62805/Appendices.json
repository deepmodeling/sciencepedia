Provide a single exact value with no rounding.", "solution": "The problem asks for the supremum of the diameters of $n$-spheres of radius $r$ under a specific Ricci curvature constraint. We proceed by following the outlined steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the sectional and Ricci curvatures of the sphere $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$. The $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r$ is a canonical example of a space of constant sectional curvature. The standard unit sphere, denoted $(S^n_1, g_1)$, has constant sectional curvature $K_1 = 1$. The metric $g_r$ of a sphere of radius $r$ is related to the metric $g_1$ of the unit sphere by a scaling factor of $r^2$, i.e., $g_r = r^2 g_1$. The sectional curvature $K$ scales inversely with the square of the scaling factor of the metric. Thus, the sectional curvature of $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$ is given by\n$$K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$$\nUsing the provided Fact (i), for a space of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is given by $\\operatorname{Ric}=(n-1)K\\,g$. For $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$, this becomes:\n$$\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}} = (n-1)K g_r = (n-1)\\frac{1}{r^2} g_r$$\n\nSecond, we compute the diameter of $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$. According to Fact (ii), geodesics on a sphere are great circles. The diameter of a Riemannian manifold, $\\operatorname{diam}(M,g)$, is defined as the supremum of the geodesic distance $d_g(x,y)$ over all pairs of points $x,y \\in M$. On a sphere, the maximum distance occurs between a point and its antipodal point. The length of a great circle on a sphere of radius $r$ is $2\\pi r$. The distance between antipodal points is half of this length. Therefore, the diameter of $\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}\\!\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi r) = \\pi r$$\n\nThird, we impose the pointwise tensor inequality $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}}\\ge (n-1)g_{r}$ to determine the allowed range for the radius $r$. Substituting the expression for $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}}$, we have:\n$$(n-1)\\frac{1}{r^2} g_r \\ge (n-1)g_r$$\nFor a non-degenerate sphere, we assume $n \\ge 2$, so $(n-1) > 0$. We can divide by this positive scalar factor without changing the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2} g_r \\ge g_r$$\nThis tensor inequality holds if and only if the corresponding scalar inequality $\\frac{1}{r^2} \\ge 1$ holds. Since the problem specifies $r>0$, we can rearrange this to $1 \\ge r^2$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $1 \\ge |r|$. As $r$ is a positive radius, the allowed range is $0 < r \\le 1$.\n\nWe are now tasked with finding the supremum of the set of diameters for spheres satisfying this condition:\n$$S = \\sup\\left\\{\\operatorname{diam}\\!\\left(S^{n}_{r}, g_{r}\\right): r>0,\\ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}}\\ge (n-1)g_{r}\\right\\}$$\nUsing our results, this set is equivalent to:\n$$S = \\sup\\left\\{\\pi r: r \\in (0, 1]\\right\\}$$\nThe function $f(r) = \\pi r$ is a strictly increasing function of $r$. The supremum of $f(r)$ on the interval $(0, 1]$ is its value at the rightmost point, $r=1$. Therefore, the supremum is:\n$$S = \\pi \\cdot 1 = \\pi$$\n\nFinally, we briefly explain the connection to the Obata rigidity theorem. The Bonnet–Myers theorem (Fact (iii)) states that for any complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)g$, its diameter must be less than or equal to $\\pi$. Our analysis shows that within the family of spheres $(S^n_r, g_r)$, this condition restricts the radius to $r \\le 1$, and consequently their diameters $\\pi r$ are all less than or equal to $\\pi$. The maximal diameter $\\pi$ is achieved if and only if $r=1$. This case, $(S^n_1, g_1)$, corresponds to the standard unit sphere, for which we have exact equality: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_1} = (n-1)g_1$ and $\\operatorname{diam}(S^n_1, g_1) = \\pi$. This demonstrates that the upper bound in the Bonnet-Myers theorem is sharp. The Obata rigidity theorem makes a stronger statement: it asserts that any complete manifold $(M,g)$ satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)g$ and achieving the maximal diameter $\\operatorname{diam}(M,g)=\\pi$ must be isometric to the standard unit sphere. The sphere is thus \"rigid\" in the sense that it is the unique geometric structure that saturates this diameter bound under the given Ricci curvature constraint. Our calculation provides a concrete illustration of this principle for the family of spherical geometries.\n\nThe exact value of the supremum of the diameters is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "3036312"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of the Obata rigidity theorem is its spectral characterization, which links the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}_g \\ge (n-1)g$ to a sharp lower bound on the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian.

The computation is to be performed by analyzing the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ and the Hessian equation it satisfies.\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between the geometric quantities associated with the metrics $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$. Let $\\nabla$ and $\\nabla^{c}$ be the Levi-Civita connections corresponding to $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$, respectively. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $S^{n}$, Koszul's formula for $\\nabla^{c}$ is:\n$$2g_{c}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = X(g_{c}(Y,Z)) + Y(g_{c}(X,Z)) - Z(g_{c}(X,Y)) + g_{c}([X,Y],Z) - g_{c}([X,Z],Y) - g_{c}([Y,Z],X)$$\nSubstituting $g_{c} = c^{2} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and noting that $c$ is a constant, we have:\n$$2c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = c^{2} \\left[ X(g_{\\mathrm{can}}(Y,Z)) + \\dots \\right] = c^{2} \\left[ 2g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z) \\right]$$\nThis implies $g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z)$. Since this holds for any vector field $Z$, we conclude that the Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant scaling of the metric:\n$$\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X}Y$$\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian of the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$. Let $\\tilde{f}: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the linear function $\\tilde{f}(x) = x_{n+1}$ whose restriction to $S^{n}$ is $f$. Let $D$ denote the flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The gradient of $\\tilde{f}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the constant vector field $D\\tilde{f} = E_{n+1} = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe gradient of $f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$, denoted $\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}} f$, is the tangential projection of $D\\tilde{f}$ onto the tangent spaces of $S^{n}$. At a point $p \\in S^{n}$, the outward unit normal vector is $N(p) = p$. The tangential projection of a vector $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $V^{\\top} = V - g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}(V, N)N$. Thus,\n$$\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}} f (p) = (E_{n+1})^{\\top} = E_{n+1} - g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}(E_{n+1}, p) p = E_{n+1} - p_{n+1} p$$\nSince $f(p) = p_{n+1}$, we can write this vector field as $G(p) = E_{n+1} - f(p)N(p)$.\n\nThe Hessian tensor $\\nabla^{2}f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ is given by $(\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}(\\mathrm{grad}_{g_{\\mathrm{can}}}f), Y)$. The covariant derivative $\\nabla_{X}G$ is the tangential projection of the ambient derivative $D_{X}G$:\n$$\\nabla_{X}G = (D_{X}G)^{\\top} = (D_{X}(E_{n+1} - fN))^{\\top}$$\nWe compute the ambient derivative term by term for a tangent vector field $X$:\n$$D_{X}(E_{n+1} - fN) = D_{X}E_{n+1} - D_{X}(fN)$$\nSince $E_{n+1}$ is a constant vector field, $D_{X}E_{n+1} = 0$. Using the product rule for $D_{X}(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + f(D_{X}N)$$\nFor the unit sphere $S^n$ with outward unit normal $N(p)=p$, the derivative of the normal field in a tangential direction $X$ (viewed as a vector in the ambient space) is $D_X N = D_X p = X$. Substituting this into the expression for $D_X(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + fX$$\nTherefore, $D_{X}G = -((Xf)N + fX)$. Taking the tangential projection:\n$$\\nabla_{X}G = (- (Xf)N - fX)^{\\top} = -fX$$\nsince $X$ is tangent and $N$ is normal.\nThe Hessian of $f$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ is then:\n$$(\\nabla^{2}f)(X,Y) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(-fX, Y) = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}(X,Y)$$\nThis means the Hessian tensor is $\\nabla^{2}f = -f g_{\\mathrm{can}}$.\n\nNow we consider the Hessian $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f$ with respect to the metric $g_{c}$. The Hessian as a bilinear form is defined by $(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)(X,Y) = X(Y(f)) - (\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y)(f)$.

We substitute our result for $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f$:\n$$-f g_{\\mathrm{can}} + kfg_{c} = 0$$\nUsing the relation $g_{c} = c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}$, we get:\n$$-f g_{\\mathrm{can}} + kf(c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = 0$$\n$$f(-1 + kc^{2})g_{\\mathrm{can}} = 0$$\nSince this equation must hold for all points on $S^{n}$, and $f$ is not identically zero, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$-1 + kc^{2} = 0 \\implies k = \\frac{1}{c^{2}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{g_{c}}f$. This operator is defined as the trace of the Hessian with respect to the metric $g_{c}$:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f)$$\nUsing the Hessian equation $\\nabla^{2}_{g_{c}}f = -kfg_{c} = -\\frac{1}{c^{2}}fg_{c}$, we find:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}\\left(-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}fg_{c}\\right) = -\\frac{f}{c^{2}} \\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(g_{c})$$\nThe trace of the metric tensor on an $n$-dimensional manifold is the dimension $n$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{tr}_{g_{c}}(g_{c}) = n$.\nThe Laplacian of $f$ is thus:\n$$\\Delta_{g_{c}}f = -\\frac{n}{c^{2}}f$$\nThe eigenvalue equation for the Laplacian is conventionally written as $\\Delta \\phi = -\\lambda \\phi$. Comparing this with our result, we identify the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ associated with the eigenfunction $f$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{n}{c^{2}}$$\nThe function $f(x)=x_{n+1}$ is a coordinate function restricted to the sphere, which is a spherical harmonic of degree $1$.

The zero eigenvalue corresponds to $j=0, k=0$. The first nonzero eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1(M)$, is the minimum of these sums over $(j,k) \\neq (0,0)$. This minimum is achieved when one index is $1$ and the other is $0$:\n- For $j=1, k=0$, the eigenvalue is $1(1+p-1)+0=p$.\n- For $j=0, k=1$, the eigenvalue is $0+1(1+q-1)=q$.\nAll other combinations yield larger values. Therefore, the first nonzero eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1(M) = \\min\\{p, q\\}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option D:** Equality holds in the Lichnerowicz estimate for $M$ when $p=q$.\n\nLet's test this claim for $p=q \\ge 2$.\nFrom option B, the Lichnerowicz bound is $\\lambda_1(M) \\ge \\frac{(p+p)\\min\\{p-1, p-1\\}}{p+p-1} = \\frac{2p(p-1)}{2p-1}$.\nFrom option C, the actual eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1(M) = \\min\\{p, p\\} = p$.\nThe statement claims that equality holds, meaning $p = \\frac{2p(p-1)}{2p-1}$.\nSince $p \\ge 2$, we can divide by $p$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{2(p-1)}{2p-1} \\implies 2p-1 = 2(p-1) = 2p-2 \\implies -1 = -2 $$\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, equality does not hold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E:** If a closed Riemannian manifold $(N^{n},h)$ satisfies equality in the Lichnerowicz estimate under the hypothesis $\\mathrm{Ric}_{h} \\ge \\rho\\, h$ with $\\rho>0$, then $(N^{n},h)$ is isometric to a round sphere of suitable radius.\n\nThis is a statement of the Obata theorem (also known as the Lichnerowicz-Obata theorem), which characterizes the equality case. The theorem states that if a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(N, h)$ satisfies $\\mathrm{Ric}_h \\ge (n-1)k h$ for a constant $k>0$, then its first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(N)$ satisfies $\\lambda_1(N) \\ge nk$. Equality $\\lambda_1(N) = nk$ holds if and only if $(N, h)$ is isometric to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$ with constant sectional curvature $k$.\nIn our notation, $\\rho = (n-1)k$, so $k=\\rho/(n-1)$, and the bound $\\lambda_1 \\ge nk$ becomes $\\lambda_1 \\ge n \\frac{\\rho}{n-1}$. The condition $\\rho>0$ ensures $k>0$. The statement in the option is a correct formulation of this fundamental theorem. A round sphere of \"suitable radius\" is one with constant sectional curvature $k = \\rho/(n-1) > 0$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nFinal summary: Options A, B, C, and E are correct statements. Option D is incorrect.", "answer": "ABCE", "id": "3035963"}]}
