A standard formulation of the theorem is as follows:\n\nLet $(M_1, g_1)$ and $(M_2, g_2)$ be Riemannian manifolds. Let $\\gamma_1:[0,L] \\to M_1$ and $\\gamma_2:[0,L] \\to M_2$ be unit-speed geodesics. Let $J_1$ and $J_2$ be Jacobi fields along $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ respectively, such that $J_i(0)=0$, $J_i(t)$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}_i(t)$, and $\\|J_1'(0)\\| = \\|J_2'(0)\\|$. If the sectional curvatures $K_1$ and $K_2$ satisfy $K_1(\\sigma_1) \\le K_2(\\sigma_2)$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$ and all $2$-planes $\\sigma_i \\subset T_{\\gamma_i(t)}M_i$, then $\\|J_1(t)\\| \\ge \\|J_2(t)\\|$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$.\n\nThe rigidity part of the theorem states that if $\\|J_1(t_0)\\| = \\|J_2(t_0)\\|$ for some $t_0 \\in (0,L]$, then the equality $\\|J_1(t)\\| = \\|J_2(t)\\|$ must hold for all $t \\in [0,t_0]$, and the sectional curvatures $K_1(\\Pi_t)$ and $K_2(\\Pi_t)$ must be equal for all $2$-planes $\\Pi_t$ containing $\\dot{\\gamma}_i(t)$ and spanned by parallel-transported vectors corresponding to $J_i'(0)$. For spaces of constant curvature, this implies $k_1=k_2$.\n\nNow, let us analyze the given problem in light of this theorem.\n1.  **Why single-point equality does not imply $k_{1}=k_{2}$:**\n    The curvatures are given as $k_{1}=1$ and $k_{2}=4$, so $k_{1} < k_{2}$. The Rauch comparison theorem in its standard form (as stated above) would compare a manifold with curvature less than or equal to another. To align with this, we can think of comparing $\\mathbb{M}_{k_{1}}$ (lower curvature) with $\\mathbb{M}_{k_{2}}$ (higher curvature).\n    The crucial premise of the Rauch theorem (and its rigidity statement) is that the initial conditions on the Jacobi fields are matched, specifically $\\|J_{1}'(0)\\| = \\|J_{2}'(0)\\|$, which means $v_{1}=v_{2}$.\n    In this problem, we have explicitly shown that to achieve $\\|J_{1}(t_{0})\\|=\\|J_{2}(t_{0})\\|$ with $k_{1} \\neq k_{2}$, we must have $v_{2} = v_{1}\\sec(t_{0})$. Since $t_{0} \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $\\sec(t_{0}) > 1$, which implies $v_{2} > v_{1}$.\n    Therefore, the condition $\\|J_{1}'(0)\\| = \\|J_{2}'(0)\\|$ is violated. We have engineered the equality of norms at a single point $t_{0}$ precisely by setting different initial derivative norms. The higher curvature of $\\mathbb{M}_{k_{2}}$ has a stronger focusing effect on geodesics, which would naturally make $\\|J_{2}(t)\\|$ smaller than $\\|J_{1}(t)\\|$ if $v_{1}=v_{2}$. To counteract this, we gave $J_{2}$ a larger initial \"velocity\" ($v_{2}>v_{1}$), allowing its norm to \"catch up\" to the norm of $J_{1}$ at the specific time $t_{0}$.\n    The problem itself is a constructed counterexample: we have $k_{1} \\neq k_{2}$ and $\\|J_{1}(t_{0})\\|=\\|J_{2}(t_{0})\\|$, which is possible because we did not satisfy all the hypotheses required for the rigidity conclusion of the Rauch theorem.\n\n2.  **Additional hypotheses for rigidity:**\n    Based on the discussion above, for the conclusion of rigidity (i.e., $k_{1}=k_{2}$) to follow from an equality of Jacobi field norms, the following additional hypotheses are necessary:\n    a) **Equality of Initial Conditions:** The initial derivative norms must be equal: $\\|J_{1}'(0)\\| = \\|J_{2}'(0)\\|$, i.e., $v_{1} = v_{2}$. This is the fundamental starting point for a fair comparison.\n    b) **Equality over an Interval:** The equality of norms, $\\|J_{1}(t)\\|=\\|J_{2}(t)\\|$, must hold not just at a single isolated time $t_{0}>0$, but for all $t$ in a continuous interval, e.g., $t \\in [0, L]$ for some $L>0$ (where $L$ is less than the first conjugate point distance for both manifolds). Equality at $t=0$ is trivial, so the non-trivial condition is equality for $t \\in (0,L]$.\n\n    If we assume $k_{1} \\le k_{2}$ and both hypotheses (a) and (b) are satisfied, then the rigidity part of the Rauch comparison theorem can be invoked to conclude that $k_{1}=k_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{v_{1}\\sec(t_{0})}$$", "id": "3036470"}, {"introduction": "The true utility of the Rauch theorem emerges when it is applied to manifolds with non-constant curvature, where Jacobi equations are often intractable.
