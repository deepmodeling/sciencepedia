The index is the dimension of the maximal subspace of the space of variation vector fields on which the second variation of the Dirichlet energy, $\\mathrm{Hess}_{\\phi}E$, is negative definite.\n\nFirst, we will derive the second variation formula for this specific case. Let $\\phi \\colon (M, g) \\to (N, h)$ be a harmonic map between Riemannian manifolds. The second variation of the energy functional $E$ at $\\phi$ for a variation vector field $V \\in \\Gamma(\\phi^{-1}TN)$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hess}_{\\phi}E(V,V) = \\int_M \\left( |\\nabla^{\\phi}V|^2 - \\mathrm{tr}_g \\langle R^N(d\\phi(e_i), V)d\\phi(e_i), V \\rangle_h \\right) d\\mu_g\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla^{\\phi}$ is the connection on the pullback bundle $\\phi^{-1}TN$, $R^N$ is the curvature tensor of the target manifold $N$, and $\\{e_i\\}$ is a local orthonormal frame on the source manifold $M$.\n\nWe specialize this to our problem where $M = N = S^n$ with the standard metric $g=h$, and $\\phi = \\text{id}_{S^n}$. The variation vector field $V$ is a vector field on $S^n$, i.e., $V \\in \\Gamma(TS^n)$. The pullback connection $\\nabla^{\\phi}$ becomes the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on $TS^n$. The differential $d\\phi$ is the identity map on each tangent space, so $d\\phi(e_i) = e_i$. The formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hess}_{\\text{id}}E(V,V) = \\int_{S^n} \\left( |\\nabla V|^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\langle R(e_i, V)e_i, V \\rangle \\right) d\\mu_g\n$$\nThe summation term is the Ricci curvature of $S^n$ applied to $V$, i.e., $\\mathrm{Ric}(V,V) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\langle R(e_i, V)e_i, V \\rangle$.\nThe standard unit $n$-sphere $S^n$ has constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For such a space, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = (n-1)g(X,Y)$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Ric}(V,V) = (n-1)|V|^2$.\nSubstituting this into the Hessian formula, we obtain the quadratic form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hess}_{\\text{id}}E(V,V) = \\int_{S^n} \\left( |\\nabla V|^2 - (n-1)|V|^2 \\right) d\\mu_g\n$$\nThe index is the dimension of the subspace of vector fields $V$ for which this expression is negative.\n\nThis integral can be expressed using the Jacobi operator $J$ for the identity map. Using integration by parts (Stokes' theorem for the compact manifold $S^n$), we have $\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla V|^2 d\\mu_g = \\int_{S^n} \\langle V, \\nabla^*\\nabla V \\rangle d\\mu_g$, where $\\nabla^*\\nabla$ is the rough Laplacian (or connection Laplacian).

We need to find the dimension of the negative eigenspace of $J$.\n\nTo analyze the spectrum of $J$, we decompose the space of vector fields $\\Gamma(TS^n)$ into orthogonal subspaces.

The space of gradient fields is invariant under the Jacobi operator $J$. We use the Weitzenböck formula, which for a gradient vector field on an Einstein manifold gives $\\nabla^*\\nabla(\\text{grad} f) = \\text{grad}(\\Delta_0 f) + (n-1)\\text{grad} f$, where $\\Delta_0$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on functions.\n    Plugging this into the Jacobi operator expression for $V=\\text{grad} f$:\n    $$\n    J(\\text{grad} f) = (\\text{grad}(\\Delta_0 f) + (n-1)\\text{grad} f) - (n-1)\\text{grad} f = \\text{grad}(\\Delta_0 f)\n    $$\n    The derivation in the original problem statement leads to $J(\\text{grad} f) = \\text{grad}(\\Delta_0 f) - 2(n-1)\\text{grad}f$. Let's re-examine that logic.\n    $J(V) = \\nabla^*\\nabla V - (n-1)V$. Using the Weitzenböck identity in the form $\\nabla^*\\nabla V = (\\Delta_H(V^\\flat) - \\mathrm{Ric}(V^\\flat))^\\sharp$, where $V^\\flat$ is the 1-form dual to $V$. For $V = \\text{grad} f$, $V^\\flat = df$. The Hodge Laplacian on an exact 1-form is $\\Delta_H(df) = d(\\delta d f) = d(\\Delta_0 f)$. The Ricci term on an Einstein manifold is $\\mathrm{Ric}(df) = (n-1)df$.\n    Thus, $\\nabla^*\\nabla(\\text{grad} f) = (d(\\Delta_0 f) - (n-1)df)^\\sharp = \\text{grad}(\\Delta_0 f) - (n-1)\\text{grad} f$.\n    So, $J(\\text{grad} f) = (\\text{grad}(\\Delta_0 f) - (n-1)\\text{grad} f) - (n-1)\\text{grad} f = \\text{grad}(\\Delta_0 f) - 2(n-1)\\text{grad} f$. The original derivation was correct.\n\n    If $f_k$ is an eigenfunction of $\\Delta_0$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$, i.e., $\\Delta_0 f_k = \\lambda_k f_k$, then $V_k = \\text{grad}f_k$ is an eigenvector of $J$:\n    $$\n    J(V_k) = \\text{grad}(\\lambda_k f_k) - 2(n-1)\\text{grad}f_k = (\\lambda_k - 2(n-1))\\text{grad}f_k = (\\lambda_k - 2(n-1))V_k\n    $$\n    The Hessian will be negative on the space spanned by $V_k$ if the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k - 2(n-1)$ is negative, i.e., $\\lambda_k < 2(n-1)$.\n\n    The eigenvalues of $\\Delta_0$ on $S^n$ are $\\lambda_k = k(k+n-1)$ for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n    - For $k=0$, $\\lambda_0 = 0$. $f_0$ is a constant function, so $V_0 = \\text{grad}f_0 = 0$. This does not contribute.\n    - For $k=1$, $\\lambda_1 = 1(1+n-1) = n$. The condition is $n < 2(n-1)$, which simplifies to $n < 2n-2$ or $2 < n$. This is true since the problem states $n \\geq 3$.\n    - For $k=2$, $\\lambda_2 = 2(2+n-1) = 2(n+1) = 2n+2$. The condition is $2n+2 < 2(n-1)$, which simplifies to $n+1 < n-1$ or $1 < -1$, which is false.\n    For any $k \\geq 2$, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$ increases, so the condition will not be met.\n\n    Thus, only the eigenspace corresponding to $k=1$ contributes to the index. The dimension of this eigenspace (the space of spherical harmonics of degree $1$) is $n+1$. The map $\\text{grad}: \\mathcal{H}_1 \\to \\Gamma(TS^n)$ is injective, so the dimension of the subspace of unstable gradient vector fields is $n+1$.\n\n2.  **Killing Vector Fields**: A variation generated by a Killing vector field is a one-parameter family of isometries. Isometries preserve the metric and hence the energy of the identity map. Thus, the second variation for a Killing field must be zero. For a Killing field $V$ on an Einstein manifold with $\\mathrm{Ric}=(n-1)g$, it is a standard result that $\\nabla^*\\nabla V = \\mathrm{Ric}(V) = (n-1)V$.\n    Substituting this into the Jacobi operator:\n    $$\n    J(V) = (n-1)V - (n-1)V = 0\n    $$\n    So, Killing fields lie in the null space of the Hessian, $\\mathrm{Hess}_{\\text{id}}E(V,V)=0$. They do not contribute to the index.\n\n3.  **Transverse Vector Fields**: For vector fields $V$ in the orthogonal complement of gradient and Killing fields, there is a known lower bound on the spectrum of the rough Laplacian, $\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla V|^2 d\\mu_g \\ge 2n \\int_{S^n} |V|^2 d\\mu_g$.\n    Using this inequality, the Hessian on this subspace is:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Hess}_{\\text{id}}E(V,V) = \\int_{S^n} \\left( |\\nabla V|^2 - (n-1)|V|^2 \\right) d\\mu_g \\ge \\int_{S^n} \\left( 2n|V|^2 - (n-1)|V|^2 \\right) d\\mu_g = (n+1) \\int_{S^n} |V|^2 d\\mu_g\n    $$\n    Since $n \\ge 3$, the factor $n+1$ is positive. The Hessian is positive definite on this subspace, so it does not contribute to the index.\n\nSumming up the contributions from the three orthogonal subspaces, the index of the identity map is the dimension of the unstable subspace of gradient vector fields.\nIndex($\\phi$) = (contribution from gradients) + (from Killing fields) + (from transverse) = $(n+1) + 0 + 0 = n+1$.\n\nThe index of the identity map $\\phi \\colon S^n \\to S^n$ for $n \\ge 3$ is $n+1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n+1}$$", "id": "2978886"}]}
