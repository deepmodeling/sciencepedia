The Laplace–Beltrami operator is a differential operator on functions defined on $M$. For a flat torus $T_G = \\mathbb{R}^{n}/\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ with the metric induced by the positive-definite symmetric matrix $G$, the metric tensor components $g_{ij}$ in the standard coordinates of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are constant and equal to the entries of $G$. The inverse metric tensor components $g^{ij}$ are the entries of $G^{-1}$. The Laplace–Beltrami operator, using the convention that makes it a positive semi-definite operator, is given by $\\Delta_G = - \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$.\n\nFunctions on the torus can be identified with $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$-periodic functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. A natural orthonormal basis for the space of square-integrable functions $L^2(T_G)$ is given by the complex exponential functions $f_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\exp(2\\pi i \\, \\mathbf{k}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is an integer vector. These are eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator.

The distinct values in the set $\\{\\lambda_{\\mathbf{k}} \\mid \\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\\}$ form the spectrum of the torus.

The multiplicity of the eigenvalue corresponding to $N$ is the number of integer vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ that produce this value $N$. We compute these multiplicities for the smallest positive values of $N$.\n\n$N=1$: $2k_1^2 + 2k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2 = 1$. This implies $k_1=k_2=0$ and $k_3^2+k_4^2=1$. The integer solutions for $(k_3, k_4)$ are $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$. This gives $4$ vectors $\\mathbf{k}$.\nThe multiplicity is $\\mu_1 = 4$.\n\n$N=2$: $2k_1^2 + 2k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2 = 2$.\n- If $k_1=k_2=0$, then $k_3^2+k_4^2=2$.

Solutions are $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$, giving $4$ pairs. This leads to $4 \\times 4 = 16$ vectors.\nThe total multiplicity is $\\mu_6 = 16+16=32$.\n\nThe ordered tuple of the first six positive eigenvalue multiplicities for $T_1$ is $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (4, 8, 16, 24, 24, 32)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the torus $T_2$ with metric matrix $G_2 = \\mathrm{diag}(2,2,1,1)$. The inverse is $G_2^{-1} = \\mathrm{diag}(1/2,1/2,1,1)$. For a vector $\\mathbf{k'} = (k'_1, k'_2, k'_3, k'_4) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^4$, the eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathbf{k'}}^{(2)} = 4\\pi^2 \\left( (k'_1)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (k'_2)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (k'_3)^2 \\cdot 1 + (k'_4)^2 \\cdot 1 \\right) = 2\\pi^2 ((k'_1)^2 + (k'_2)^2 + 2(k'_3)^2 + 2(k'_4)^2)\n$$\nTwo tori are isospectral if their sets of eigenvalues, including multiplicities, are identical. This is equivalent to showing that the set of numbers represented by the quadratic form $Q_1(\\mathbf{k}) = 2k_1^2 + 2k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2$ for $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^4$ is the same as the set of numbers represented by $Q_2(\\mathbf{k'}) = (k'_1)^2 + (k'_2)^2 + 2(k'_3)^2 + 2(k'_4)^2$ for $\\mathbf{k'} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^4$, and that each number is represented with the same frequency.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{k} = (k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$ be an arbitrary vector in $\\mathbb{Z}^4$. Consider the permutation map $P: \\mathbb{Z}^4 \\to \\mathbb{Z}^4$ defined by $P(\\mathbf{k}) = (k_3, k_4, k_1, k_2)$. This map is a bijection on the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^4$. Let $\\mathbf{k'} = P(\\mathbf{k})$, so $k'_1=k_3$, $k'_2=k_4$, $k'_3=k_1$, and $k'_4=k_2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Q_2$:\n$$\nQ_2(\\mathbf{k'}) = (k_3)^2 + (k_4)^2 + 2(k_1)^2 + 2(k_2)^2 = 2k_1^2 + 2k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2 = Q_1(\\mathbf{k})\n$$\nThis shows that for any integer vector $\\mathbf{k}$, the value of the quadratic form $Q_1$ at $\\mathbf{k}$ is equal to the value of the quadratic form $Q_2$ at the permuted vector $\\mathbf{k'} = P(\\mathbf{k})$. Since $P$ is a bijection, for any integer $N$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of integer vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ such that $Q_1(\\mathbf{k})=N$ and the set of integer vectors $\\mathbf{k'}$ such that $Q_2(\\mathbf{k'})=N$.\nTherefore, the number of ways any integer $N$ can be represented by $Q_1$ is identical to the number of ways it can be represented by $Q_2$. This directly implies that the eigenvalues and their multiplicities are identical for both tori $T_1$ and $T_2$.\nThe two tori are isospectral. Consequently, the multiplicity tuple $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ for $T_2$ is the same as for $T_1$.\nThe requested tuple is $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (4, 8, 16, 24, 24, 32)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 8 & 16 & 24 & 24 & 32\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2981607"}, {"introduction": "Beyond specific examples, Sunada's theorem provides a powerful and elegant algebraic machine for systematically constructing isospectral, non-isometric manifolds.

The problem statement has been validated and found to be well-posed, scientifically grounded, and self-contained. It presents a calculation exercise that, while straightforward from an advanced theoretical perspective, requires explicit verification from first principles as requested.\n\nThe problem asks us to consider the symmetric group $G=S_{4}$ and two of its subgroups, $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$, and verify they form a Sunada triple by showing they are almost conjugate. From this verification, we are to determine their common index in $G$.\n\nFirst, we identify the subgroups. $H_{1}$ is generated by $r=(1\\,2\\,3\\,4)$ and $s=(1\\,3)$. The elements of $H_{1}$ are of the form $s^{i}r^{j}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. We list the $8$ elements of $H_{1}$:\n- The cyclic subgroup generated by $r$:\n  - $r^{0} = e$, the identity permutation.\n  - $r^{1} = (1\\,2\\,3\\,4)$.\n  - $r^{2} = (1\\,2\\,3\\,4)(1\\,2\\,3\\,4) = (1\\,3)(2\\,4)$.\n  - $r^{3} = (1\\,2\\,3\\,4)^{-1} = (1\\,4\\,3\\,2)$.\n- The remaining elements are obtained by left-multiplication by $s$:\n  - $s r^{0} = s = (1\\,3)$.\n  - $s r^{1} = (1\\,3)(1\\,2\\,3\\,4) = (1\\,2)(3\\,4)$.\n  - $s r^{2} = (1\\,3)(1\\,3)(2\\,4) = (2\\,4)$.\n  - $s r^{3} = (1\\,3)(1\\,4\\,3\\,2) = (1\\,4)(2\\,3)$.\nThus, $H_{1} = \\{e, (1\\,2\\,3\\,4), (1\\,3)(2\\,4), (1\\,4\\,3\\,2), (1\\,3), (1\\,2)(3\\,4), (2\\,4), (1\\,4)(2\\,3)\\}$. The order of $H_{1}$ is $|H_{1}|=8$. This is a dihedral group of order $8$, which is a Sylow $2$-subgroup of $S_{4}$.\n\nNext, we identify the conjugacy classes of $G=S_{4}$. The conjugacy classes are determined by cycle type. The partitions of $4$ give the cycle types:\n1.  Partition $1+1+1+1$: The identity, $e$. The class is $\\mathcal{C}_{e}=\\{e\\}$, with size $|\\mathcal{C}_{e}|=1$.\n2.  Partition $2+1+1$: Transpositions of the form $(ab)$. There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ such elements.

They are equal.\n\nThe condition $|H_{1}\\cap \\mathcal{C}|=|H_{2}\\cap \\mathcal{C}|$ is satisfied for all conjugacy classes $\\mathcal{C}$ of $S_{4}$. Thus, $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ are almost conjugate, and $(S_{4}, H_{1}, H_{2})$ is a Sunada triple. Since $H_{2}$ is conjugate to $H_{1}$, this result is expected, as conjugate subgroups are always almost conjugate.\n\nFinally, we determine the common index $[G:H_{1}]=[G:H_{2}]$. The order of the group $G=S_{4}$ is $|G|=4! = 24$. From our enumeration of elements, we found $|H_{1}| = |H_{2}| = 8$.

The coefficients $a_k$ in the asymptotic expansion of the heat trace are famous examples, encoding fundamental geometric information. This exercise [@problem_id:2981662] challenges you to compute the first two heat invariants for the round sphere, explicitly linking them to its volume and total scalar curvature, thereby demonstrating how the spectrum can \"hear\" fundamental aspects of a manifold's geometry.", "problem": "Consider the round $n$-dimensional sphere $S^{n}_{\\rho}$ of radius $\\rho>0$ equipped with its standard Riemannian metric.

No numerical approximation is required, and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a standard, well-posed problem in spectral geometry with a unique and verifiable solution.\n\nThe heat invariants $a_{k}$ appear in the small-time asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ without boundary. The first two coefficients are given by the general formulas:\n$$\na_{0} = \\int_{M} 1 \\, dV_{g} = \\mathrm{Vol}(M, g)\n$$\n$$\na_{1} = \\frac{1}{6} \\int_M R_{g} \\, dV_{g}\n$$\nwhere $dV_{g}$ is the Riemannian volume element and $R_{g}$ is the scalar curvature of the metric $g$. We will compute these quantities for the specified manifold, the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^{n}_{\\rho}$ of radius $\\rho > 0$, using its properties of homogeneity and constant curvature.\n\nFirst, we compute the coefficient $a_{0}$.\nThis coefficient is the total volume of the manifold $S^{n}_{\\rho}$. The volume of the unit sphere $S^{n}_{1}$ is given by the well-known formula involving the Gamma function:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(S^{n}_{1}) = \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nThe standard metric on $S^{n}_{\\rho}$ is a scaling of the metric on $S^{n}_{1}$ by a factor of $\\rho^{2}$. This implies that the volume element scales by a factor of $(\\sqrt{\\rho^{2}})^{n} = \\rho^{n}$. Therefore, the total volume of $S^{n}_{\\rho}$ is $\\rho^{n}$ times the volume of $S^{n}_{1}$:\n$$\na_{0} = \\mathrm{Vol}(S^{n}_{\\rho}) = \\rho^{n} \\mathrm{Vol}(S^{n}_{1}) = \\rho^{n} \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the coefficient $a_{1}$.\nThis requires the scalar curvature $R$ of $S^{n}_{\\rho}$. Due to the homogeneity and isotropy of the sphere, its sectional curvature $K$ is constant everywhere and is given by $K = \\frac{1}{\\rho^{2}}$. For an $n$-dimensional manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the scalar curvature $R$ is also constant and is given by the relation $R = n(n-1)K$. For the sphere $S^{n}_{\\rho}$, this yields:\n$$\nR = \\frac{n(n-1)}{\\rho^{2}}\n$$\nSince $R$ is a constant over the manifold, the integral for $a_{1}$ simplifies to a product of $\\frac{1}{6}$, $R$, and the manifold's volume:\n$$\na_{1} = \\frac{1}{6} \\int_{S^{n}_{\\rho}} R \\, dV_{g} = \\frac{1}{6} R \\int_{S^{n}_{\\rho}} dV_{g} = \\frac{1}{6} R \\cdot \\mathrm{Vol}(S^{n}_{\\rho}) = \\frac{1}{6} R \\cdot a_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R$ and $a_{0}$:\n$$\na_{1} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{n(n-1)}{\\rho^{2}} \\right) \\left( \\rho^{n} \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)} \\right) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{3} \\rho^{n-2} \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nAs required, we now perform the two verification steps.\n\nFirst verification: Scaling behavior under metric dilation $g \\mapsto \\lambda^{2}g$.\nSuch a dilation is equivalent to scaling the radius, $\\rho \\mapsto \\lambda\\rho$. The general heat invariant $a_{k}$ is known to scale as $a_{k} \\mapsto \\lambda^{n-2k} a_{k}$. We check this for $k=0$ and $k=1$.\nFor $k=0$, the expected scaling is $\\lambda^{n}$. Our result for $a_{0}$ is $a_{0}(\\rho) = \\rho^{n} \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}$. Under the change $\\rho \\mapsto \\lambda\\rho$, we have:\n$a_{0}(\\lambda\\rho) = (\\lambda\\rho)^{n} \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)} = \\lambda^{n} \\left( \\rho^{n} \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)} \\right) = \\lambda^{n} a_{0}(\\rho)$. This is correct.\nFor $k=1$, the expected scaling is $\\lambda^{n-2}$. Our result for $a_{1}$ is $a_{1}(\\rho) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{3} \\rho^{n-2} \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}$. Under the change $\\rho \\mapsto \\lambda\\rho$, we have:\n$a_{1}(\\lambda\\rho) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{3} (\\lambda\\rho)^{n-2} \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)} = \\lambda^{n-2} \\left( \\frac{n(n-1)}{3} \\rho^{n-2} \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)} \\right) = \\lambda^{n-2} a_{1}(\\rho)$. This is also correct.\n\nSecond verification: Consistency of the ratio $a_{1}/a_{0}$ with the average scalar curvature.\nThe problem requires checking that $\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{0}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\langle R \\rangle$, where $\\langle R \\rangle$ is the average scalar curvature, defined as $\\langle R \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_M R \\, dV}{\\mathrm{Vol}(M)}$.\nFor $S^{n}_{\\rho}$, since $R$ is constant, its average value is simply $R$ itself: $\\langle R \\rangle = R = \\frac{n(n-1)}{\\rho^{2}}$.\nTherefore, the right-hand side of the identity is $\\frac{1}{6} \\langle R \\rangle = \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{n(n-1)}{\\rho^{2}}$.\nNow we compute the left-hand side using our derived expressions for $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{n(n-1)}{3} \\rho^{n-2} \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}}{\\rho^{n} \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}} = \\frac{n(n-1)\\rho^{n-2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\rho^{n}} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{6\\rho^{2}}\n$$\nThe left-hand side and right-hand side are identical. This completes the verification.\nThe final expressions for $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$ are compiled into a single row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\rho^{n} \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)} & \\frac{n(n-1)}{3} \\rho^{n-2} \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2981662"}]}
