Substituting these series into the PDEs and differentiating term-by-term, we obtain equations for the Fourier coefficients $\\hat{f}_k$ and $\\hat{g}_k$ for each mode $k$:\n$$\n(1) \\implies (2\\pi i k_1) \\hat{f}_k + (2\\pi i k_2) \\hat{g}_k = 0 \\implies k_1 \\hat{f}_k + k_2 \\hat{g}_k = 0\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\implies (2\\pi i k_1) \\hat{g}_k - (2\\pi i k_2) \\hat{f}_k = 0 \\implies -k_2 \\hat{f}_k + k_1 \\hat{g}_k = 0\n$$\nThis is a homogeneous linear system for $(\\hat{f}_k, \\hat{g}_k)$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} k_1 & k_2 \\\\ -k_2 & k_1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{f}_k \\\\ \\hat{g}_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of the matrix is $k_1^2 - (-k_2)(k_2) = k_1^2 + k_2^2 = |k|^2$.\nIf $k \\neq (0,0)$, the determinant is non-zero, and the system has only the trivial solution $\\hat{f}_k = 0$ and $\\hat{g}_k = 0$.\nIf $k = (0,0)$, the determinant is zero, and the system becomes $0=0$, which places no restriction on $\\hat{f}_{(0,0)}$ and $\\hat{g}_{(0,0)}$.\nTherefore, all Fourier coefficients must vanish except possibly for the $k=(0,0)$ term. This means the functions $f$ and $g$ must be constant:\n$$\nf(x,y) = \\hat{f}_{(0,0)} = c_1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(x,y) = \\hat{g}_{(0,0)} = c_2\n$$\nfor some real constants $c_1, c_2$. Consequently, any harmonic $1$-form on $T^2$ must be of the form $\\alpha = c_1 dx + c_2 dy$.\n\nPart 3: Basis and topological interpretation\n\nFrom the result of Part 2, the space of harmonic $1$-forms on $T^2$, denoted $\\mathcal{H}^1(T^2)$, consists of all forms $\\alpha = c_1 dx + c_2 dy$ where $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is a real vector space. The forms $dx$ and $dy$ are linearly independent (as they form a basis for the cotangent space at every point), and they span $\\mathcal{H}^1(T^2)$. Thus, an explicit basis for $\\mathcal{H}^1(T^2)$ is $\\{dx, dy\\}$. The dimension of this space is $2$. This agrees with the Hodge theorem, which states that $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}^p(M)) = b_p(M)$, the $p$-th Betti number of the manifold $M$. For the torus, $b_1(T^2)=2$.\n\nNow, we show that these basis forms are closed but not exact. A form $\\omega$ is closed if $d\\omega=0$ and exact if $\\omega = d\\phi$ for some smooth function (a $0$-form) $\\phi$.\nFor the basis forms $\\alpha_1=dx$ and $\\alpha_2=dy$, their exterior derivatives are:\n$$\nd(\\alpha_1) = d(dx) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d(\\alpha_2) = d(dy) = 0\n$$\nBoth are closed.\n\nTo check for exactness, we integrate them along the standard generating loops of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(T^2, [0,0]) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$. Let these generators be $\\gamma_1$, the path from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, and $\\gamma_2$, the path from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1)$. On the torus, these are closed loops. We can parameterize them as $\\gamma_1(t) = (t,0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ and $\\gamma_2(t) = (0,t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nAccording to Stokes' theorem, if a closed form $\\omega$ were exact (i.e., $\\omega = d\\phi$), its integral over any closed loop $\\gamma$ must be zero: $\\int_\\gamma \\omega = \\int_\\gamma d\\phi = 0$.\nLet's compute the integrals for our basis forms:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_1} dx = \\int_0^1 1\\,dt = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_1} dy = \\int_0^1 0\\,dt = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_2} dx = \\int_0^1 0\\,dt = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_2} dy = \\int_0^1 1\\,dt = 1\n$$\nSince $\\int_{\\gamma_1} dx = 1 \\neq 0$, the form $dx$ is not exact.\nSince $\\int_{\\gamma_2} dy = 1 \\neq 0$, the form $dy$ is not exact.\nThus, the basis forms $\\{dx, dy\\}$ for the space of harmonic $1$-forms are closed but not exact.

Then, the standard Ricci endomorphism $\\text{Ric}^{\\sharp}$ acts on this vector field, producing a new vector field $V = \\text{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\omega^{\\sharp})$ with components $V^m = \\text{Ric}_{k}^{m}(\\omega^{\\sharp})^k$. Finally, this vector field is mapped back to a $1$-form $V^{\\flat}$ by lowering the index, so that its components are $(V^{\\flat})_j = g_{jm}V^m$. The problem asks for the endomorphism on $T^*M$ to be expressed in terms of the components of $\\omega$, which is $(\\mathcal{R}(\\omega))_k = \\text{Ric}_k^m \\omega_m$. This shows that the action on the components of the covector is matrix multiplication by $\\text{Ric}_k^m$.\n\n### Part 2: Application to the Unit 3-Sphere $S^3$\n\nFor an $n$-dimensional manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\text{Ric} = (n-1)K g$. For the unit $3$-sphere $S^3$ with its standard round metric, we have $n=3$ and a constant sectional curvature of $K=1$.\nTherefore, the Ricci tensor is $\\text{Ric}_{kj} = (3-1)(1)g_{kj} = 2g_{kj}$.\n\nThe components of the Ricci endomorphism are $\\text{Ric}_{k}^{m} = g^{mj}\\text{Ric}_{kj} = g^{mj}(2g_{kj}) = 2\\delta_{k}^{m}$.\nThus, the action of the curvature term on a $1$-form $\\omega$ is:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{R}(\\omega))_k = \\text{Ric}_{k}^{m}\\omega_m = 2\\delta_{k}^{m}\\omega_m = 2\\omega_k\n$$\nThis means $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = 2\\omega$. The Weitzenböck formula on $S^3$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta_H\\omega = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla\\omega + 2\\omega\n$$\nIt is a standard result that in geodesic normal coordinates $(x^i)$ centered at a point $p$, the Hodge Laplacian acting on a $1$-form $\\omega$ at $p$ can be expressed as:\n$$\n(\\Delta_H\\omega)_k(p) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_k}{\\partial (x^i)^2} \\right)(p) + (\\mathcal{R}(\\omega))_k(p)\n$$\nFor $S^3$, this becomes:\n$$\n(\\Delta_H\\omega)_k(p) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_k}{\\partial (x^i)^2} \\right)(p) + 2\\omega_k(p)\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Computation of $|\\Delta_{H}\\omega|^{2}(p)$\n\nWe are given the $1$-form $\\omega$ near $p$ by its components:\n$$\n\\omega_{1} = 2+3x^{1}+x^{2}x^{3}-4(x^{1})^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{2} = -1+2x^{2}+5x^{1}x^{3}+3(x^{2})^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{3} = 4x^{3}-2x^{1}x^{2}+(x^{3})^{2}\n$$\nThe point $p$ corresponds to coordinates $(x^1, x^2, x^3) = (0,0,0)$. First, we evaluate the components of $\\omega$ at $p$:\n$$\n\\omega_1(p) = 2, \\quad \\omega_2(p) = -1, \\quad \\omega_3(p) = 0\n$$\nSo, $2\\omega_k(p)$ gives the vector $(4, -2, 0)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the second partial derivatives of each component at $p$:\nFor $\\omega_1$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_1}{\\partial (x^1)^2} = -8, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_1}{\\partial (x^2)^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_1}{\\partial (x^3)^2} = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_1}{\\partial (x^i)^2}(p) = -8 $$\nFor $\\omega_2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_2}{\\partial (x^1)^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_2}{\\partial (x^2)^2} = 6, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_2}{\\partial (x^3)^2} = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_2}{\\partial (x^i)^2}(p) = 6 $$\nFor $\\omega_3$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_3}{\\partial (x^1)^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_3}{\\partial (x^2)^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_3}{\\partial (x^3)^2} = 2 $$\n$$ \\implies \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega_3}{\\partial (x^i)^2}(p) = 2 $$\nNote that all mixed second partial derivatives of the quadratic terms (e.g., $\\partial_1\\partial_2 (x^1x^2)$) are constant and non-zero, but they do not contribute to the sums $\\sum_i \\partial_i^2 \\omega_k$.\n\nNow we compute the components of $(\\Delta_H\\omega)(p)$:\n$$\n(\\Delta_H\\omega)_1(p) = -\\left(-8\\right) + 2(2) = 8+4 = 12\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta_H\\omega)_2(p) = -(6) + 2(-1) = -6-2 = -8\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta_H\\omega)_3(p) = -(2) + 2(0) = -2\n$$\nSo, the covector $(\\Delta_H\\omega)(p)$ has components $(12, -8, -2)$ with respect to the basis $(\\mathrm{d}x^k)|_p$.\n\nFinally, we compute the squared pointwise norm $|\\Delta_{H}\\omega|^{2}(p)$. Since we are at the center of geodesic normal coordinates, the basis $\\{\\partial_i\\}$ is orthonormal, which means the metric components are $g_{ij}(p) = \\delta_{ij}$ and $g^{ij}(p)=\\delta^{ij}$. The norm is calculated using the metric:\n$$\n|\\Delta_{H}\\omega|^{2}(p) = g^{ij}(p)(\\Delta_H\\omega)_i(p)(\\Delta_H\\omega)_j(p) = \\sum_{k=1}^3 ((\\Delta_H\\omega)_k(p))^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\Delta_{H}\\omega|^{2}(p) = (12)^2 + (-8)^2 + (-2)^2 = 144 + 64 + 4 = 212\n$$\nThe final result is a single real number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{212}$$", "id": "3032400"}]}
