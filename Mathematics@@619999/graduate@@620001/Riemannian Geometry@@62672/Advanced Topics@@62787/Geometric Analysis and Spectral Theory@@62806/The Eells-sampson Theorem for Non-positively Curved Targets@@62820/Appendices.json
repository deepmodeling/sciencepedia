It describes a standard problem in geometric analysis, the harmonic map heat flow, in a simplified but non-trivial context. All necessary data and definitions are provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the time evolution of the energy $E(u(t))$ of a map $u: S^1 \\times [0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ governed by the harmonic map heat flow. The source manifold is the circle $M = S^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}/(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})$ with its standard flat metric $ds^2 = dx^2$, and the target manifold is the Euclidean space $N = \\mathbb{R}^k$ with its standard flat metric.\n\nThe evolution equation is given by $\\partial_t u = \\tau(u)$, where $\\tau(u)$ is the tension field of the map $u$. For a map $u: (M, g) \\to (N, h)$, the tension field is defined as the trace of the second covariant derivative of $u$, $\\tau(u) = \\mathrm{tr}_g(\\nabla du)$.

Consequently, their Christoffel symbols are identically zero: ${}^M\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$ and ${}^N\\Gamma_{\\alpha\\beta}^\\gamma = 0$. On $S^1$, we have a single coordinate $x$, and the metric tensor is $g_{11}=1$, so its inverse is $g^{11}=1$.

The Eells–Sampson theorem asserts global existence and convergence of the harmonic map heat flow under a curvature hypothesis on the target, together with uniqueness of the harmonic representative in a given homotopy class when the target curvature is strictly negative.

In the Bochner identity for the evolution of the energy density $e(u)$ along the harmonic map heat flow, the target curvature contribution appears with a sign controlled by the sectional curvature of $N$.

Uniqueness of harmonic representatives in a given homotopy class depends on the convexity of the squared distance function in the target. Since $S^{k}$ has positive curvature, squared distance is not globally convex along geodesics, and uniqueness can fail; moreover, eigenmaps into $S^{k}$ need not minimize energy within their homotopy class and can be unstable under perturbations.\n\nD.

This is done via a Bochner-type formula, which gives the evolution of $e(u)$ along the flow:\n    $$ (\\partial_t - \\Delta_g) e(u) = -|\\nabla du|^2 - \\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle \\text{Ric}^M(e_i, e_j), du(e_i), du(e_j) \\rangle_h + \\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle R^N(du(e_i), du(e_j))du(e_j), du(e_i) \\rangle_h $$\n    where $\\{e_i\\}$ is a local orthonormal frame on $(M,g)$, $\\text{Ric}^M$ is the Ricci curvature of $M$, and $R^N$ is the Riemann curvature tensor of $N$. The last term, the target curvature term, is critical. If $K_N \\le 0$, this term is non-positive. This allows one to obtain a differential inequality of the form $(\\partial_t - \\Delta_g) e(u) \\le C e(u)$ (where $C$ depends on a lower bound for $\\text{Ric}^M$), and the maximum principle then implies that $e(u)$ remains bounded for all time, leading to global existence of a smooth solution.\n\n    For $N=S^k$, $K_{S^k}=+1 > 0$. The target curvature term becomes $\\sum_{i,j} \\langle R^{S^k}(du(e_i), du(e_j))du(e_j), du(e_i) \\rangle_h = \\sum_{i<j} |du(e_i) \\wedge du(e_j)|^2_h \\ge 0$. This term is now a non-negative source term in the evolution equation for $e(u)$. It can drive the energy density to infinity in finite time, which manifests as a \"blow-up\" of the gradient, $\\lvert du \\rvert$. This leads to the formation of singularities, and the guarantee of long-time existence is lost.\n\n2.  **Failure of Uniqueness and Stability:** The uniqueness part of the Eells-Sampson theorem (for $K_N < 0$) relies on the geometric fact that negative curvature implies convexity of the squared distance function along geodesics. This convexity is used to show that the energy functional $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_M |du|^2 d\\text{vol}_g$ has a unique critical point (the harmonic map) in a given homotopy class.\n\n    For $N=S^k$ with positive curvature, the squared distance function is not convex. Geodesics can reconverge (e.g., at the antipodal point). This allows the energy functional to have a more complex landscape, with potentially multiple critical points in the same homotopy class, including stable local minima and unstable saddle points. An eigenmap is harmonic, so it is a stationary solution, $u(t) = u_0$, to the flow. However, it may be an unstable stationary point. The second variation of energy for a harmonic map $u$ involves a term of the form $-\\int_M \\langle R^N(du(e_i), v)du(e_j), v \\rangle \\text{ (summed)}$, where $v$ is a variation field. For $K_N > 0$, this term can be negative, leading to instability. Thus, a small perturbation of an eigenmap might cause the flow to evolve towards a different harmonic map of lower energy, or to develop a singularity.\n\n3.  **Energy Monotonicity:** The energy functional is $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_M \\lvert du \\rvert^2 d\\text{vol}_g$. Its time derivative along the flow $\\partial_t u = \\tau(u)$ is:\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_M \\frac{1}{2}\\langle du, du \\rangle_h d\\text{vol}_g = \\int_M \\langle D_t(du), du \\rangle_h d\\text{vol}_g $$\n    where $D_t$ is the covariant derivative along the curve $t \\mapsto u(x,t)$. Commuting derivatives and integrating by parts:\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\int_M \\langle \\nabla(\\partial_t u), du \\rangle_h d\\text{vol}_g = -\\int_M \\langle \\partial_t u, \\text{Tr}_g(\\nabla du) \\rangle_h d\\text{vol}_g = -\\int_M \\langle \\partial_t u, \\tau(u) \\rangle_h d\\text{vol}_g $$\n    Substituting $\\partial_t u = \\tau(u)$, we get:\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -\\int_M \\lvert \\tau(u) \\rvert^2 d\\text{vol}_g \\le 0 $$\n    This inequality holds regardless of the geometry of the target manifold $N$. The energy is always non-increasing along the harmonic map heat flow.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. $S^{k}$ satisfies the non-positivity curvature hypothesis because its sectional curvature is non-positive; therefore, the Eells–Sampson theorem guarantees global existence and convergence of the harmonic map heat flow in every homotopy class for maps into $S^{k}$.**\n    This statement is fundamentally flawed. The standard sphere $S^k$ has constant positive sectional curvature, $K_{S^k}=+1$. It explicitly violates the non-positivity ($K \\le 0$) hypothesis of the Eells–Sampson theorem. The premise is false.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. In the Bochner identity for the evolution of the energy density $e(u)$ along the harmonic map heat flow, the target curvature contribution appears with a sign controlled by the sectional curvature of $N$. For $N=S^{k}$ with positive curvature, this contribution has the opposite sign from the non-positive case, so the maximum principle-based uniform gradient bounds used by Eells–Sampson break down; as a consequence, the flow can lose long-time existence due to blow-up of $\\lvert du\\rvert$.**\n    This statement is a precise and accurate description of the analytical failure of the Eells-Sampson proof method. The positive curvature of $S^k$ introduces a positive source term into the evolution equation for $e(u)$, which invalidates the maximum principle argument used to establish a priori bounds on the gradient $\\lvert du \\rvert$. This breakdown is the direct cause for potential finite-time singularities and loss of global existence.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Uniqueness of harmonic representatives in a given homotopy class depends on the convexity of the squared distance function in the target. Since $S^{k}$ has positive curvature, squared distance is not globally convex along geodesics, and uniqueness can fail; moreover, eigenmaps into $S^{k}$ need not minimize energy within their homotopy class and can be unstable under perturbations.**\n    This statement correctly identifies the geometric reason for the failure of the uniqueness conclusion. Positive curvature prevents the convexity arguments that guarantee a unique harmonic map in a homotopy class for negatively curved targets. This allows for multiple harmonic maps. The statement correctly points out that eigenmaps, while being harmonic (critical points of energy), can be unstable saddle points rather than energy minimizers.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **D. Because $S^{k}$ has positive curvature, the energy $E(u(t))=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\int_{M}\\lvert du(t)\\rvert^{2}\\,d\\operatorname{vol}_{g}$ is non-increasing only when $K_{S^{k}}\\le 0$, so for $S^{k}$ the energy fails to be non-increasing; hence Eells–Sampson cannot even establish monotonicity of energy along the flow.**\n    This statement is incorrect. As shown in the derivation above, the energy $E(u(t))$ is a non-increasing function of time for the harmonic map heat flow, $dE/dt \\le 0$, regardless of the target manifold's curvature. This is a general property of gradient flows.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. For domains of dimension $m\\ge 3$, harmonic map heat flow into $S^{k}$ can develop finite-time singularities caused by concentration of energy (formation of “bubbles”), consistent with the loss of the curvature-control mechanisms in Eells–Sampson. Even though an eigenmap $u_{0}$ itself satisfies $\\tau(u_{0})=0$ and is stationary, nearby initial data can still blow up, so global smoothing and convergence in general fail for targets with positive curvature.**\n    This statement accurately describes a known, concrete consequence of the failure of the Eells-Sampson machinery for positively curved targets. The blow-up phenomena (bubbling) for domain dimension $m \\ge 3$ are a direct result of the loss of gradient control discussed in option B. It also correctly notes that the stationary nature of an eigenmap does not imply its stability; nearby initial conditions can indeed lead to flow solutions that develop singularities. This provides a specific example of the failure of global existence and convergence.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2995333"}]}
