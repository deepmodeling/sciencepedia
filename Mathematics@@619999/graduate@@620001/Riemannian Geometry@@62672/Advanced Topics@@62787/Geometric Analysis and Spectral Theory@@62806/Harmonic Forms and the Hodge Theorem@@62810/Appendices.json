The manifold is the oriented circle $S^{1}$ of dimension $n=1$. The global coordinate is $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the metric is $g=\\mathrm{d}t^{2}$, and the volume form is $\\mathrm{vol}_{g} = \\mathrm{d}t$. We consider differential forms in degree $k=0$ (functions) and $k=1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the action of the Hodge star operator $*$. The defining property is that for any two $k$-forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, $\\alpha \\wedge *\\beta = \\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_{g} \\mathrm{vol}_{g}$.\n\n1) Action of the Hodge Star $*$\n\nOn $0$-forms ($k=0$):\nLet $\\alpha = 1$, which is a basis for constant $0$-forms. Then $*1$ is a $(n-k)=(1-0)=1$-form. We can write $*1 = f(t)\\mathrm{d}t$ for some function $f(t)$. Using the defining property with $\\alpha = \\beta = 1$:\n$$1 \\wedge *1 = \\langle 1, 1 \\rangle_{g} \\mathrm{vol}_{g}$$\nThe inner product of functions is their product, so $\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle_{g} = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.

Thus, for any constant function $c$, $*c = c\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. Specifically for the basis form $1$:\n$$*1 = \\mathrm{d}t$$\nFor a general $0$-form (function) $f(t)$, we have $*f(t) = f(t) *1 = f(t) \\mathrm{d}t$.\n\nOn $1$-forms ($k=1$):\nLet $\\alpha = \\mathrm{d}t$, the basis $1$-form.

The eigenvalue equation is $\\Delta \\omega = \\lambda \\omega$.\n\nFor $0$-forms: $\\Delta f = \\lambda f \\implies -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}f}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}} = \\lambda f \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}f}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}} + \\lambda f = 0$.\nThe solutions $f(t)$ must be periodic with period $2\\pi$.\n- If $\\lambda = 0$: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}f}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}}=0 \\implies f(t) = At+B$. Periodicity requires $A=0$. So $f(t)=B$ (constants). The eigenforms are constant functions.\n- If $\\lambda > 0$: Let $\\lambda = m^{2}$ for $m>0$. The solution is $f(t) = A\\cos(mt) + B\\sin(mt)$. Periodicity requires $\\cos(m \\cdot 2\\pi)=1$ and $\\sin(m \\cdot 2\\pi)=0$, which implies $m$ must be a positive integer, $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_m = m^{2}$ for $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$.\n- Eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$: A basis for the eigenforms is $\\{1\\}$.\n- Eigenvalues $\\lambda_m = m^{2}$ for $m \\ge 1$: A basis for the eigenforms is $\\{\\cos(mt), \\sin(mt)\\}$.\n\nFor $1$-forms: $\\Delta(f(t)\\mathrm{d}t) = \\lambda (f(t)\\mathrm{d}t) \\implies -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}f}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}}\\mathrm{d}t = \\lambda f(t)\\mathrm{d}t$.\nThis reduces to the same differential equation for the coefficient function $f(t)$: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}f}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}} + \\lambda f = 0$, with the same periodicity condition.\nThe eigenvalues are identical to the $0$-form case.\n- Eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$: The coefficient function is a constant, so the eigenform is $c \\cdot \\mathrm{d}t$. A basis is $\\{\\mathrm{d}t\\}$.\n- Eigenvalues $\\lambda_m = m^{2}$ for $m \\ge 1$: The coefficient functions are $\\cos(mt)$ and $\\sin(mt)$. A basis for the eigenforms is $\\{\\cos(mt)\\mathrm{d}t, \\sin(mt)\\mathrm{d}t\\}$.\n\n3) Harmonic Forms\n\nHarmonic forms are forms $\\omega$ such that $\\Delta \\omega = 0$. These are the eigenforms corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda=0$.\n\nHarmonic $0$-forms, $\\mathcal{H}^{0}(S^{1})$:\nThe eigenforms for $\\lambda=0$ are the constant functions $f(t)=c$. This space is spanned by the form $1$. The dimension of this space is $h^{0}(S^{1}) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}^{0}(S^{1})) = 1$.\n\nHarmonic $1$-forms, $\\mathcal{H}^{1}(S^{1})$:\nThe eigenforms for $\\lambda=0$ are the forms $f(t)\\mathrm{d}t$ where $f(t)=c$ is a constant. This space is spanned by the form $\\mathrm{d}t$. The dimension of this space is $h^{1}(S^{1}) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}^{1}(S^{1})) = 1$.\n\nFinal step: Euler Characteristic $\\chi(S^{1})$\n\nThe Hodge theorem provides an isomorphism between the space of harmonic $k$-forms $\\mathcal{H}^{k}(M)$ and the $k$-th de Rham cohomology group $H^{k}_{dR}(M)$. This implies their dimensions are equal: $h^{k}(M) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}^{k}(M)) = \\dim(H^{k}_{dR}(M)) = b_{k}(M)$, where $b_k$ is the $k$-th Betti number.\n\nThe Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ is defined as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers. For $M=S^1$ (dimension $n=1$), this is:\n$$\\chi(S^{1}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{1} (-1)^{k} b_{k}(S^{1}) = b_{0}(S^{1}) - b_{1}(S^{1})$$\nUsing the dimensions of the harmonic form spaces we computed:\n$$b_{0}(S^{1}) = h^{0}(S^{1}) = 1$$\n$$b_{1}(S^{1}) = h^{1}(S^{1}) = 1$$\nThere are no forms of degree $k<0$ or $k>1$, so $h^k(S^1)=0$ for $k \\notin \\{0,1\\}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\chi(S^{1}) = 1 - 1 = 0$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2978677"}, {"introduction": "A central theme in modern geometry is the use of analysis to deduce topological information from a manifold's curvature.

We are to use a Bochner-WeitzenbÃ¶ck type argument.\n\nA differential $k$-form $\\omega \\in \\Omega^{k}(S^{n})$ is harmonic if it lies in the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian operator $\\Delta = d \\delta + \\delta d$. That is, $\\Delta \\omega = 0$. The sphere $S^n$ is a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold, so Hodge theory applies. The dimension of the space of harmonic $k$-forms, denoted $h_k(n) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^k(S^n)$, is a topological invariant equal to the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold. However, the problem requires a derivation from first principles of differential geometry, not an appeal to algebraic topology.\n\nThe primary tool for this derivation is the Bochner-WeitzenbÃ¶ck formula, which relates the Hodge Laplacian to the connection Laplacian on forms. For a $k$-form $\\omega$ on a general $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, this formula is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega = \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + \\mathcal{R}(\\omega)\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection extended to the bundle of $k$-forms, $\\nabla^{*} \\nabla$ is the connection Laplacian (or rough Laplacian), and $\\mathcal{R}$ is a linear operator involving the Riemann curvature tensor.

In the case $n=1$, the metric is flat ($K=0$), but the product $k(n-k)$ is zero for $k=0$ or $k=1$, so the formula remains consistent as will be shown. Thus, for any $n \\ge 1$ and $0 \\le k \\le n$, the Bochner-WeitzenbÃ¶ck formula on $S^n$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega = \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + k(n-k) \\omega\n$$\n\nLet $\\omega$ be a harmonic $k$-form on $S^n$. By definition, $\\Delta\\omega = 0$. Substituting this into the formula yields:\n$$\n\\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + k(n-k) \\omega = 0\n$$\nWe now take the global $L^2$ inner product of this equation with $\\omega$. The $L^2$ inner product is defined as $\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{S^n} \\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_x dV_g$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_x$ is the pointwise inner product on forms and $dV_g$ is the volume element.\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + k(n-k) \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = 0\n$$\nBy linearity of the inner product and the integral, this becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g + \\int_{S^n} k(n-k) \\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = 0\n$$\nThe operator $\\nabla^*$ is the formal adjoint of $\\nabla$ with respect to the $L^2$ inner product. Since $S^n$ is compact and without boundary, we can integrate by parts:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = \\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla \\omega, \\nabla \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = \\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g\n$$\nThe term $\\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x$ is just the squared pointwise norm of $\\omega$, denoted $|\\omega|^2$. So, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g + k(n-k) \\int_{S^n} |\\omega|^2 dV_g = 0\n$$\nWe analyze this equation for different values of $k$.\n\n**Vanishing result for $0 < k < n$**\n\nFor the range $0 < k < n$, both $k$ and $n-k$ are positive integers. Therefore, their product $k(n-k)$ is strictly positive.\nThe integrands $|\\nabla\\omega|^2$ and $|\\omega|^2$ are non-negative. Thus, both integrals are non-negative:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_{S^n} |\\omega|^2 dV_g \\ge 0\n$$\nThe equation is a sum of a non-negative term and a strictly positive constant times another non-negative term, which equals zero.

Since $\\omega$ is a smooth form, this implies that $\\omega$ must be identically zero everywhere on $S^n$.\nTherefore, for $0 < k < n$, the only harmonic $k$-form is the zero form. The space of harmonic forms $\\mathcal{H}^k(S^n)$ is the trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$. The dimension is $h_k(n) = 0$.\n\n**Harmonic forms for $k=0$ and $k=n$**\n\nFor the boundary cases $k=0$ and $k=n$, the integer factor $k(n-k)$ becomes zero. The integral equation then reduces to:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g = 0\n$$\nSince the integrand $|\\nabla\\omega|^2$ is non-negative and continuous, the integral can be zero only if the integrand is identically zero everywhere. This means $\\nabla\\omega = 0$. In other words, a form is harmonic if and only if it is a parallel form.\n\n**Case $k=0$:**\nA $0$-form is a function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(S^n)$. The condition $\\nabla f = 0$ is equivalent to the exterior derivative being zero, $df = 0$. This means the function $f$ is locally constant.\nIf $n \\ge 1$, the sphere $S^n$ is a connected manifold. A locally constant function on a connected space must be globally constant. Thus, the harmonic $0$-forms are the constant functions $f(x) = c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This space is a $1$-dimensional real vector space. So, $h_0(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nIf $n = 0$, $S^0$ is the discrete space consisting of two points $\\{-1, 1\\}$. It is not connected. A locally constant function can take a different constant value on each connected component. Thus, the space of harmonic $0$-forms on $S^0$ is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and its dimension is $h_0(0) = 2$.\n\n**Case $k=n$:**\nAn $n$-form $\\omega$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold can be written locally as $\\omega = f \\, dV_g$, where $f$ is a function and $dV_g$ is the local volume form. The condition for $\\omega$ being harmonic is that it must be parallel, $\\nabla\\omega = 0$.\nWe use the product rule for the covariant derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla\\omega = \\nabla(f \\, dV_g) = (df) \\otimes dV_g + f (\\nabla dV_g)\n$$\nA fundamental property of the Levi-Civita connection is that it preserves the metric, which implies that the associated volume form is parallel: $\\nabla dV_g = 0$.\nHence, the condition $\\nabla\\omega = 0$ simplifies to $(df) \\otimes dV_g = 0$, which implies $df = 0$.\nAs in the $k=0$ case, this means the function $f$ must be constant on each connected component of $S^n$.\nIf $n \\ge 1$, $S^n$ is connected, so $f$ must be a global constant, $f=c$. The harmonic $n$-forms are the constant multiples of the volume form, $\\omega = c \\, dV_g$. This space is $1$-dimensional. So, $h_n(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe case $k=n=0$ is covered by the $k=0$ analysis, which gives $h_0(0)=2$.\n\n**Summary and Final Expression**\nWe have found the following dimensions for the space of harmonic $k$-forms on $S^n$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $h_k(n) = 0$ for $0 < k < n$.\n    \\item $h_0(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$, and $h_0(0) = 2$.\n    \\item $h_n(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nWe can combine these results into a single expression using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{a,b}$, which is $1$ if $a=b$ and $0$ otherwise.\nFor $n \\ge 1$: $h_k(n) = 1$ if $k=0$ or $k=n$, and $0$ otherwise.

We seek to find the condition on the function $h$ for $\\omega$ to be harmonic, i.e., $\\Delta_g \\omega = 0$.\n\nFor any form $\\alpha \\in \\Omega^k(M)$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold, the codifferential $\\delta_g$ is defined as $\\delta_g \\alpha = (-1)^{n(k+1)+1} *_g d *_g \\alpha$, where $*_g$ is the Hodge star operator associated with the metric $g$.\n\nIn our case, $n=2$ and $\\omega \\in \\Omega^2(\\Sigma^2)$, so $k=2$. The exterior derivative $d\\omega$ is a $3$-form on a $2$-manifold, so $d\\omega = 0$. Consequently, the term $\\delta_g d \\omega$ in the Laplacian vanishes, and we have $\\Delta_g \\omega = d\\delta_g \\omega$.\nThe condition for $\\omega$ to be harmonic simplifies to $d\\delta_g \\omega = 0$.\n\nLet us compute $\\delta_g \\omega$. First, we apply the Hodge star to $\\omega = h \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}_g$. The Hodge star maps $k$-forms to $(n-k)$-forms. Here, it maps a $2$-form to a $0$-form (a function). By definition, $*_g(h \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}_g) = h \\cdot (*_g \\mathrm{vol}_g)$. Furthermore, for any oriented Riemannian manifold, the Hodge star of the volume form is the constant function $1$. Thus, $*_g \\omega = h$.\n\nNext, we apply the exterior derivative $d$ to this function, which yields the $1$-form $dh$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\delta_g \\omega$ itself:\n$$\n\\delta_g \\omega = (-1)^{2(2+1)+1} *_g d *_g \\omega = (-1)^7 *_g d (h) = -*_g(dh).\n$$\nThis is a $1$-form. The condition for $\\omega$ to be harmonic, $\\Delta_g \\omega = 0$, becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta_g \\omega = d(\\delta_g \\omega) = d(-*_g(dh)) = -d*_g(dh) = 0.\n$$\nSo, $\\omega = h \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}_g$ is harmonic if and only if $d*_g(dh)=0$.\n\nTo show this implies $h$ is constant, we use an integration argument. Consider the integral of the $2$-form $h(d*_g(dh))$ over the compact manifold $\\Sigma^2$. By Stokes' theorem, $\\int_{\\Sigma^2} d(h \\cdot *_g(dh)) = 0$ since $\\Sigma^2$ has no boundary. Using the product rule for the exterior derivative, $d(h \\cdot *_g(dh)) = dh \\wedge (*_g(dh)) + h \\cdot (d*_g(dh))$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma^2} h \\cdot (d*_g(dh)) = - \\int_{\\Sigma^2} dh \\wedge (*_g(dh)).\n$$\nA fundamental property of the Hodge star is that for any $1$-form $\\alpha$, the wedge product $\\alpha \\wedge (*_g \\alpha)$ is related to the metric inner product $\\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle_g$ by $\\alpha \\wedge (*_g \\alpha) = \\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle_g \\mathrm{vol}_g = |\\alpha|_g^2 \\mathrm{vol}_g$. Applying this to $\\alpha = dh$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma^2} h \\cdot (d*_g(dh)) = - \\int_{\\Sigma^2} |dh|_g^2 \\mathrm{vol}_g.\n$$\nIf $\\omega$ is harmonic, then $d*_g(dh)=0$. The left side of the equation is zero. This implies\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma^2} |dh|_g^2 \\mathrm{vol}_g = 0.\n$$\nSince the integrand $|dh|_g^2$ is a non-negative continuous function, its integral being zero implies that the integrand must be identically zero everywhere on $\\Sigma^2$. Thus, $|dh|_g^2 = 0$, which means $dh=0$. As $\\Sigma^2$ is connected (being a compact surface), the condition $dh=0$ implies that the function $h$ must be a constant, i.e., $h=c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, on any compact oriented Riemannian surface, the space of harmonic $2$-forms consists precisely of the constant multiples of the Riemannian volume form.\n\n**Part 2: Harmonic $2$-forms on $(M, g_0)$ and $(M, g_1)$**\n\nWe now apply this general result to the $2$-torus $M = T^2$. Since $T^2$ is a compact, oriented surface, the conclusion from Part 1 holds.\n\nFor the metric $g_0$, which is the standard flat metric, the associated volume form is given as $\\mathrm{vol}_{g_0} = dx \\wedge dy$. The space of harmonic $2$-forms with respect to $g_0$, denoted $\\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_0)$, is therefore the one-dimensional vector space spanned by this form:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_0) = \\{ c \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy) \\mid c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}.\n$$\nNow consider the conformally related metric $g_1 = \\exp(2f) g_0$, where $f \\in C^\\infty(T^2)$ is a nonconstant function. To find the space $\\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_1)$, we first need the volume form $\\mathrm{vol}_{g_1}$. For a conformal change of metric $g' = \\lambda g$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold, the volume forms are related by $\\mathrm{vol}_{g'} = \\lambda^{n/2} \\mathrm{vol}_g$. Here, $n=2$ and the conformal factor is $\\lambda = \\exp(2f)$. Thus,\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}_{g_1} = (\\exp(2f))^{2/2} \\mathrm{vol}_{g_0} = \\exp(2f) \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy).\n$$\nApplying the result from Part 1, the space of harmonic $2$-forms with respect to $g_1$ is the one-dimensional vector space spanned by $\\mathrm{vol}_{g_1}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_1) = \\{ c \\cdot (\\exp(2f) dx \\wedge dy) \\mid c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}.\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Dimension of the intersection**\n\nWe seek the dimension of the subspace $\\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_0) \\cap \\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_1)$, which is a subspace of $\\Omega^2(M)$. Let $\\omega$ be a $2$-form in this intersection.\n\nSince $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_0)$, it must be of the form $\\omega = c_0 (dx \\wedge dy)$ for some constant $c_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSince $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_1)$, it must be of the form $\\omega = c_1 (\\exp(2f) dx \\wedge dy)$ for some constant $c_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nEquating these two expressions for $\\omega$, we have:\n$$\nc_0 (dx \\wedge dy) = c_1 \\exp(2f) (dx \\wedge dy).\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to give:\n$$\n(c_0 - c_1 \\exp(2f)) (dx \\wedge dy) = 0.\n$$\nSince $dx \\wedge dy$ is a nowhere-vanishing $2$-form on $M$, the function multiplying it must be identically zero on $M$:\n$$\nc_0 - c_1 \\exp(2f(x,y)) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } (x,y) \\in T^2.\n$$\nWe analyze this equation.\nIf $c_1 = 0$, the equation becomes $c_0=0$. In this case, $\\omega = 0 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy) = 0$. The zero form is trivially in the intersection.\nIf $c_1 \\neq 0$, we can write $\\exp(2f(x,y)) = \\frac{c_0}{c_1}$. This implies that the function $\\exp(2f)$ must be constant on $T^2$. If $\\exp(2f)$ is constant, then $f$ must also be a constant function. However, the problem statement explicitly requires that $f$ is a **nonconstant** smooth function. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the case $c_1 \\neq 0$ is impossible. The only possibility is $c_1=0$, which in turn forces $c_0=0$.\n\nThis means that the only $2$-form lying in the intersection is the zero form, $\\omega = 0$. The intersection is the trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$. The dimension of this space is $0$.\n\n**Explanation of Betti Number Invariance**\n\nThe Hodge theorem provides an isomorphism between the space of harmonic $k$-forms $\\mathcal{H}^k(M,g)$ and the $k$-th de Rham cohomology group $H^k_{dR}(M)$ for any compact oriented Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. The dimension of this cohomology group is the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k(M)$. Thus, $b_k(M) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^k(M,g)$.\n\nThe de Rham cohomology groups $H^k_{dR}(M)$ are defined as the quotient of the vector space of closed $k$-forms, $Z^k(M)$, by the subspace of exact $k$-forms, $B^k(M)$. A form $\\alpha$ is closed if $d\\alpha=0$ and exact if $\\alpha=d\\beta$ for some form $\\beta$. The definitions of closed and exact forms depend only on the exterior derivative operator $d$, which is intrinsic to the smooth structure of the manifold $M$ and does not depend on any metric. Consequently, the cohomology groups $H^k_{dR}(M)$ and their dimensions, the Betti numbers $b_k(M)$, are topological invariants of $M$. They are independent of the choice of Riemannian metric $g$.\n\nIn this problem, $b_2(T^2)=1$. The Hodge theorem guarantees that for any metric $g$ on $T^2$, the space of harmonic $2$-forms $\\mathcal{H}^2(T^2,g)$ will be one-dimensional. Our calculations confirm this for both $g_0$ and $g_1$. However, the Hodge Laplacian operator $\\Delta_g = d\\delta_g+\\delta_g d$ is metric-dependent through the codifferential $\\delta_g$ and Hodge star $*_g$. Therefore, a change in metric generally changes the specific subspace of $\\Omega^k(M)$ that is identified as being harmonic. The problem provides a concrete example: the one-dimensional spaces $\\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_0) = \\mathrm{span}\\{dx \\wedge dy\\}$ and $\\mathcal{H}^2(M,g_1) = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\exp(2f) dx \\wedge dy\\}$ are distinct subspaces of $\\Omega^2(M)$ because $f$ is nonconstant, yet both have dimension $b_2(T^2)=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2978669"}]}
