The Jacobi field $J$ is further constrained to be orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}$ at all points, i.e., $\\langle J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle = 0$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the geodesic deviation equation, also known as the Jacobi equation:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) + R(J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along the curve $\\gamma$, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nThe manifold is specified as having constant sectional curvature $K$. For such a manifold, the Riemann tensor has a specific, simplified form:\n$$ R(X, Y)Z = K(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y) $$\nfor any vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. We apply this formula to the curvature term in the Jacobi equation by setting $X=J(s)$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}(s)$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}(s)$:\n$$ R(J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = K(\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle J(s) - \\langle J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}(s)) $$\nThe problem states that $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which means its velocity vector has a constant length of $1$, so $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle = 1$. It is also given that the Jacobi field $J(s)$ is everywhere orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(s)$, which means $\\langle J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\rangle = 0$. Substituting these two conditions into the expression for the curvature term gives:\n$$ R(J(s), \\dot{\\gamma}(s))\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = K(1 \\cdot J(s) - 0 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}(s)) = K J(s) $$\nSubstituting this simplified term back into the Jacobi equation yields a much simpler differential equation:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) + K J(s) = 0 $$\nTo solve this vector differential equation, we introduce a suitable basis. Let $\\{e_1(s), e_2(s), \\dots, e_n(s)\\}$ be an orthonormal frame of vector fields along $\\gamma(s)$ that is parallel transported along $\\gamma$. We choose this frame such that $e_1(s) = \\dot{\\gamma}(s)$ for all $s$. The condition that the frame is parallel transported means $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} e_i(s) = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nSince $J(s)$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = e_1(s)$, it must lie in the subspace spanned by $\\{e_2(s), \\dots, e_n(s)\\}$. We can therefore express $J(s)$ as a linear combination:\n$$ J(s) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} y_i(s) e_i(s) $$\nwhere $y_i(s)$ are scalar functions of the parameter $s$. Now we compute the covariant derivatives of $J(s)$. Since the basis vectors $e_i(s)$ are parallel transported, the covariant derivative acts only on the component functions:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{dy_i}{ds} e_i(s) $$\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(s) = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} e_i(s) $$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Jacobi equation, we get:\n$$ \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} e_i(s) + K \\sum_{i=2}^{n} y_i(s) e_i(s) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\left( \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} + K y_i(s) \\right) e_i(s) = 0 $$\nSince the vectors $\\{e_2(s), \\dots, e_n(s)\\}$ are linearly independent, the coefficient of each must be zero. This decouples the vector equation into a system of $n-1$ identical scalar ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{d^2y_i}{ds^2} + K y_i(s) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\} $$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. Since $K0$ is given, the characteristic equation $r^2 + K = 0$ has imaginary roots $r = \\pm i\\sqrt{K}$.

Applying this to the general solution:\n$$ y_i(0) = A_i \\cos(0) + B_i \\sin(0) = A_i \\cdot 1 + B_i \\cdot 0 = A_i $$\nThus, we must have $A_i=0$ for all $i$. The solution for a Jacobi field vanishing at $s=0$ must therefore be of the form:\n$$ y_i(s) = B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s) $$\nThe Jacobi field itself is $J(s) = \\left( \\sum_{i=2}^{n} B_i e_i(s) \\right) \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s)$.\nFor $J(s)$ to be a non-trivial field, at least one of the constants $B_i$ must be non-zero. Let's assume this is the case.\n\nNow we apply the second condition, $J(s_*)=0$, for some $s_*0$:\n$$ J(s_*) = \\left( \\sum_{i=2}^{n} B_i e_i(s_*) \\right) \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s_*) = 0 $$\nSince at least one $B_i$ is non-zero, the vector $\\sum_{i=2}^{n} B_i e_i(s_*)$ is a non-zero vector. Therefore, for the entire expression to be zero, the scalar part must vanish:\n$$ \\sin(\\sqrt{K} s_*) = 0 $$\nThis equation holds if the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. That is:\n$$ \\sqrt{K} s_* = m \\pi, \\quad \\text{for some integer } m $$\nThe problem asks for conjugate points for $s_*0$, so we must have $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. The sequence of parameter values for conjugate points along the geodesic $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$ s_{*,m} = \\frac{m \\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}, \\quad m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nThe first conjugate point corresponds to the smallest positive value of $s_*$, which occurs for $m=1$:\n$$ s_{*,1} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} $$\nSubsequent conjugate points occur at integer multiples of this fundamental distance. The distance between the $m$-th and $(m+1)$-th conjugate point is:\n$$ s_{*, m+1} - s_{*, m} = \\frac{(m+1)\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} - \\frac{m\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} $$\nThis demonstrates that subsequent conjugate points occur at equal parameter separations, a direct consequence of the periodic nature of the solution to the harmonic oscillator equation governing the Jacobi field components. The period of oscillation is determined by the constant curvature $K$.\n\nThe parameter distance to the first conjugate point along $\\gamma$ is thus $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}}$$", "id": "2976440"}, {"introduction": "Building on the geometric concept of focusing, this practice delves into the physical implications within General Relativity.

This is a static, spherically symmetric metric. The stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$ is related to the geometry via the Einstein field equations, $G_{ab} = 8\\pi G T_{ab}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, which we set to $1$ for simplicity in intermediate steps and will reinsert if necessary. We use the mixed-tensor form $G^{\\mu}_{\\nu} = 8\\pi G T^{\\mu}_{\\nu}$. For a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, the stress-energy tensor is diagonal in the given coordinate basis, and for a static observer with 4-velocity $u^a$, we identify the components in the mixed form as $T^{t}_{t} = -\\rho$, $T^{r}_{r} = p_r$, and $T^{\\theta}_{\\theta} = T^{\\phi}_{\\phi} = p_t$, where $p_t$ is the tangential pressure.\n\nThe relevant components of the Einstein tensor for a metric of the form $ds^2 = -e^{2\\Phi(r)}dt^2 + (1-b(r)/r)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2 d\\Omega^2$ are:\n$$\nG^{t}_{t} = -\\frac{b'(r)}{r^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nG^{r}_{r} = \\frac{2r\\Phi'(r)(1-b(r)/r) - b(r)/r}{r^2}\n$$\nIn this problem, the redshift function is vanishing, so $\\Phi(r)=0$ and $\\Phi'(r)=0$.

The negative energy density violates the Weak Energy Condition, a requirement for this type of wormhole.\n\nNext, we consider the geometric properties of the specified null congruence at the throat $r=r_0$. The congruence is a set of null geodesics that are hypersurface-orthogonal, spherically symmetric, and radially directed.\n-   **Twist:** The twist tensor $\\omega_{ab}$ measures the rotation of nearby geodesics around each other. For a congruence to be hypersurface-orthogonal, its tangent vector field $k^a$ must satisfy $k_{[a}\\nabla_b k_{c]} = 0$. This condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the twist tensor, $\\omega_{ab}=0$. Since the congruence is given as hypersurface-orthogonal, its twist vanishes everywhere along the geodesics, including at the throat.\n-   **Shear:** The shear tensor $\\sigma_{ab}$ measures the anisotropic distortion of the cross-section of the congruence. The problem specifies a spherically symmetric congruence within a spherically symmetric spacetime. Any deformation of the congruence's circular cross-section must be isotropic (i.e., uniform in all directions on the 2-sphere) to preserve spherical symmetry. The shear, being the trace-free (anisotropic) part of the deformation, must therefore vanish. Thus, $\\sigma_{ab}=0$ everywhere.\n-   **Expansion:** The expansion scalar $\\theta = \\nabla_a k^a$ measures the rate of change of the cross-sectional area of the congruence. The area of a sphere of coordinate radius $r$ is $A(r)=4\\pi r^2$. The throat of the wormhole, at $r=r_0$, is defined as the surface of minimal area connecting the two asymptotic regions. For the given metric, $r$ is the area-radius, and $A(r)$ is minimized at $r=r_0$ for $r \\in [r_0, \\infty)$. Since the expansion is related to the change in area by $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2A}\\frac{dA}{d\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the affine parameter along the geodesics, the condition of minimal area ($dA/dr|_{r_0}=0$) implies that the expansion must vanish at the throat: $\\theta|_{r=r_0}=0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the derivative of the expansion, $\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\lambda}$, at the throat $r=r_0$. The evolution of the expansion is governed by the Raychaudhuri equation for a null congruence:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\lambda} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^{2} - \\sigma_{ab}\\sigma^{ab} + \\omega_{ab}\\omega^{ab} - R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}\n$$\nAt the throat $r=r_0$, we have established that $\\theta=0$, $\\sigma_{ab}=0$, and $\\omega_{ab}=0$. The Raychaudhuri equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\lambda} \\right|_{r=r_{0}} = -R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}|_{r=r_{0}}\n$$\nwhere $R_{ab}$ is the Ricci tensor and $k^a$ is the null tangent vector. From the Einstein field equations, $R_{ab} = 8\\pi G (T_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} T g_{ab})$, where $T$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor. The contraction with the null vector $k^a$ gives:\n$$\nR_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} = 8\\pi G \\left( T_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} - \\frac{1}{2} T g_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} \\right)\n$$\nSince $g_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}=0$ for a null vector, this simplifies to the fundamental relation:\n$$\nR_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} = 8\\pi G T_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}\n$$\nThe problem specifies normalization such that the null tangent has orthonormal components $k^{\\hat{a}} = (1, \\pm 1, 0, 0)$ at $r=r_0$. An orthonormal frame for a static observer is given by $e_{\\hat{t}}=\\partial_t$, $e_{\\hat{r}}=\\sqrt{g_{rr}}\\partial_r$, etc. At the throat $r=r_0$, $g_{rr}=(1-r_0^2/r^2)^{-1} \\to \\infty$, and this frame is degenerate. A proper analysis requires regular coordinates at the throat, such as the proper radial distance $l$, where $dl^2 = dr^2/(1-r_0^2/r^2)$, so that $ds^2 = -dt^2+dl^2+r(l)^2 d\\Omega^2$. At the throat ($l=0$, $r=r_0$), a valid orthonormal frame is $(\\partial_t, \\partial_l, \\frac{1}{r_0}\\partial_\\theta, \\frac{1}{r_0\\sin\\theta}\\partial_\\phi)$. In these coordinates, a radial null vector $k^a$ normalized to have unit energy ($k_t=-1$) has components $k^a=(1, \\pm 1, 0, 0)$. These are also its components in the associated orthonormal frame.\nThe contraction $T_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}$ can be evaluated in any frame. In the orthonormal frame at the throat, it is:\n$$\nT_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} = T_{\\hat{a}\\hat{b}} k^{\\hat{a}}k^{\\hat{b}} = T_{\\hat{t}\\hat{t}}(k^{\\hat{t}})^2 + T_{\\hat{r}\\hat{r}}(k^{\\hat{r}})^2 = \\rho(1)^2 + p_r(\\pm 1)^2 = \\rho + p_r\n$$\nWe evaluate this sum at the throat, $r=r_0$:\n$$\n\\rho(r_0) = -\\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{8\\pi G r_{0}^{4}} = -\\frac{1}{8\\pi G r_{0}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\np_r(r_0) = -\\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{8\\pi G r_{0}^{4}} = -\\frac{1}{8\\pi G r_{0}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n(\\rho+p_r)|_{r=r_0} = -\\frac{1}{8\\pi G r_{0}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{8\\pi G r_{0}^{2}} = -\\frac{2}{8\\pi G r_{0}^{2}} = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi G r_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expressions for the derivative of the expansion:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\lambda} \\right|_{r=r_{0}} = -R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}|_{r=r_{0}} = -8\\pi G (T_{ab}k^{a}k^{b})|_{r=r_{0}} = -8\\pi G \\left(-\\frac{1}{4\\pi G r_{0}^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{2}{r_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nThe positive value indicates that null geodesics passing through the throat are defocused, a characteristic feature of a traversable wormhole supported by exotic matter that violates the null energy condition ($T_{ab}k^a k^b  0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{r_{0}^{2}}}$$", "id": "2976393"}, {"introduction": "This final practice applies our understanding of geodesics in curved spacetime to one of the most celebrated phenomena in physics: gravitational lensing.

Proceeding:\n$$L^2\\left(\\frac{du}{d\\phi}\\right)^2 = E^2 - L^2u^2 + 2GML^2u^3$$\nDividing by $L^2$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{du}{d\\phi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{E^2}{L^2} - u^2 + 2GMu^3$$\nThe impact parameter is defined as $b=L/E$. Thus, $E^2/L^2=1/b^2$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{du}{d\\phi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{b^2} - u^2 + 2GMu^3$$\nTo obtain the second-order orbit equation, we differentiate with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$2\\left(\\frac{du}{d\\phi}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^2u}{d\\phi^2}\\right) = -2u\\frac{du}{d\\phi} + 6GMu^2\\frac{du}{d\\phi}$$\nAssuming we are not at a turning point ($\\frac{du}{d\\phi} \\neq 0$), we can divide by $2\\frac{du}{d\\phi}$:\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{d\\phi^2} = -u + 3GMu^2$$\nThe orbit equation is therefore:\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{d\\phi^2} + u = 3GMu^2$$\n\n### Part 2: Perturbation Analysis and Bending Angle\n\nWe solve this equation in the weak-field limit, where the term on the right-hand side is small. We perform a perturbation analysis by expressing the solution as $u(\\phi) = u_0(\\phi) + u_1(\\phi)$, where $u_0$ is the solution for flat spacetime ($M=0$) and $u_1$ is a small correction.\n\nThe zeroth-order equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2u_0}{d\\phi^2} + u_0 = 0$$\nThe solution represents a straight line. For a light ray with impact parameter $b$, whose point of closest approach is at $\\phi=0$, the trajectory is $r\\cos\\phi=b$. In terms of $u_0=1/r$, this is:\n$$u_0(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{b}\\cos\\phi$$\nThis unperturbed path corresponds to asymptotes at $\\phi = \\pm\\pi/2$, where $r \\to \\infty$ and $u_0 \\to 0$.\n\nSubstituting $u=u_0+u_1$ into the full orbit equation and keeping terms to first order in $GM$:\n$$\\frac{d^2(u_0+u_1)}{d\\phi^2} + (u_0+u_1) = 3GM(u_0+u_1)^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{d^2u_0}{d\\phi^2} + u_0\\right) + \\left(\\frac{d^2u_1}{d\\phi^2} + u_1\\right) \\approx 3GMu_0^2$$\nThe first term is zero by the zeroth-order equation. The first-order equation for $u_1$ is:\n$$\\frac{d^2u_1}{d\\phi^2} + u_1 = 3GM\\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\cos\\phi\\right)^2 = \\frac{3GM}{b^2}\\cos^2\\phi$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2\\phi = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cos(2\\phi))$, we have:\n$$\\frac{d^2u_1}{d\\phi^2} + u_1 = \\frac{3GM}{2b^2}(1+\\cos(2\\phi))$$\nA particular solution that is symmetric about the point of closest approach ($\\phi=0$) is:\n$$u_1(\\phi) = \\frac{GM}{b^2}(1+\\sin^2\\phi)$$\nWe verify this solution:\n$u_1'(\\phi) = \\frac{2GM}{b^2}\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi = \\frac{GM}{b^2}\\sin(2\\phi)$\n$u_1''(\\phi) = \\frac{2GM}{b^2}\\cos(2\\phi)$\n$u_1''+u_1 = \\frac{2GM}{b^2}\\cos(2\\phi) + \\frac{GM}{b^2}(1+\\sin^2\\phi) = \\frac{GM}{b^2}(2\\cos(2\\phi)+1+\\sin^2\\phi)$\nUsing $\\cos(2\\phi) = 2\\cos^2\\phi - 1$ and $\\sin^2\\phi = 1 - \\cos^2\\phi$:\n$u_1''+u_1 = \\frac{GM}{b^2}(2(2\\cos^2\\phi-1)+1+1-\\cos^2\\phi) = \\frac{GM}{b^2}(4\\cos^2\\phi-2+2-\\cos^2\\phi) = \\frac{3GM}{b^2}\\cos^2\\phi$.\nThe particular solution is correct. The full solution to first order is:\n$$u(\\phi) \\approx u_0(\\phi) + u_1(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{b}\\cos\\phi + \\frac{GM}{b^2}(1+\\sin^2\\phi)$$\n\nThe bending angle is found by determining the asymptotic directions of the light ray, i.e., the angles $\\phi_{\\pm\\infty}$ where $r\\to\\infty$, or $u \\to 0$. We set $u(\\phi)=0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{1}{b}\\cos\\phi + \\frac{GM}{b^2}(1+\\sin^2\\phi)$$\nWe look for solutions near the unperturbed asymptotes $\\phi=\\pm\\pi/2$.\n\nFor the outgoing ray, $\\phi \\approx \\pi/2$. Let $\\phi_{out} = \\pi/2 + \\delta_{out}$, where $\\delta_{out}$ is small.\n$\\cos(\\pi/2+\\delta_{out}) = -\\sin\\delta_{out} \\approx -\\delta_{out}$.\n$\\sin(\\pi/2+\\delta_{out}) = \\cos\\delta_{out} \\approx 1$.\nSubstituting into the equation $u=0$:\n$$0 \\approx \\frac{1}{b}(-\\delta_{out}) + \\frac{GM}{b^2}(1+1^2) = -\\frac{\\delta_{out}}{b} + \\frac{2GM}{b^2}$$\n$$\\delta_{out} = \\frac{2GM}{b}$$\nSo, the outgoing asymptote is at $\\phi_{out} = \\pi/2 + \\frac{2GM}{b}$.\n\nFor the incoming ray, $\\phi \\approx -\\pi/2$. Let $\\phi_{in} = -\\pi/2 - \\delta_{in}$, where $\\delta_{in}$ is a small positive deflection. The text had a sign error in the setup. Let's use $\\phi_{in} = -\\pi/2 + \\delta_{in}$ where $\\delta_{in}$ is a small angle.\n$\\cos(-\\pi/2+\\delta_{in}) = \\sin\\delta_{in} \\approx \\delta_{in}$.\n$\\sin(-\\pi/2+\\delta_{in}) = -\\cos\\delta_{in} \\approx -1$.\nSubstituting into the equation $u=0$:\n$$0 \\approx \\frac{1}{b}(\\delta_{in}) + \\frac{GM}{b^2}(1+(-1)^2) = \\frac{\\delta_{in}}{b} + \\frac{2GM}{b^2}$$\n$$\\delta_{in} = -\\frac{2GM}{b}$$\nSo, the incoming asymptote is at $\\phi_{in} = -\\pi/2 - \\frac{2GM}{b}$.\n\nThe total angle swept by the light ray is $\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_{out} - \\phi_{in}$:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{2GM}{b}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{2GM}{b}\\right) = \\pi + \\frac{4GM}{b}$$\nA straight line path would subtend an angle of $\\pi$. The bending angle, $\\hat{\\alpha}$, is the excess angle over $\\pi$:\n$$\\hat{\\alpha} = \\Delta\\phi - \\pi = \\left(\\pi + \\frac{4GM}{b}\\right) - \\pi = \\frac{4GM}{b}$$\nThis is the leading-order deflection angle in radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4GM}{b}}$$", "id": "2976373"}]}
