Also, the derivative of any metric component with respect to $t$ is zero. Hence, all Christoffel symbols with an upper index $t$ are zero:\n$$\\Gamma^{t}_{\\nu\\rho} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\nu, \\rho$$\n\nNow, let's compute the components for $\\mu = x$:\n$$\\Gamma^{x}_{\\nu\\rho} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{xx}\\left(\\partial_{\\nu}g_{x\\rho}+\\partial_{\\rho}g_{x\\nu}-\\partial_{x}g_{\\nu\\rho}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(\\partial_{\\nu}g_{x\\rho}+\\partial_{\\rho}g_{x\\nu}-\\partial_{x}g_{\\nu\\rho}\\right)$$\n- For $(\\nu, \\rho) = (t, t)$:\n$$\\Gamma^{x}_{tt} = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(\\partial_{t}g_{xt}+\\partial_{t}g_{xt}-\\partial_{x}g_{tt}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(0+0-0\\right) = 0$$\n- For $(\\nu, \\rho) = (t, x)$:\n$$\\Gamma^{x}_{tx} = \\Gamma^{x}_{xt} = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(\\partial_{t}g_{xx}+\\partial_{x}g_{xt}-\\partial_{x}g_{tx}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(0+0-0\\right) = 0$$\n- For $(\\nu, \\rho) = (x, x)$:\n$$\\Gamma^{x}_{xx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(\\partial_{x}g_{xx}+\\partial_{x}g_{xx}-\\partial_{x}g_{xx}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(\\partial_{x}g_{xx}\\right)$$\n$$\\Gamma^{x}_{xx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2x)\\left(2\\exp(2x)\\right) = 1$$\nThus, the only nonzero Christoffel symbol is $\\Gamma^{x}_{xx} = 1$.\n\n**2.

Let $\\gamma(\\tau) = (t(\\tau), x(\\tau))$.\n\n- For $\\mu = t$:\n$$\\ddot{t} + \\Gamma^{t}_{\\nu\\rho}\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\nu}\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\rho} = 0$$\nSince all $\\Gamma^{t}_{\\nu\\rho}=0$, this equation simplifies to:\n$$\\ddot{t} = 0$$\n\n- For $\\mu = x$:\n$$\\ddot{x} + \\Gamma^{x}_{\\nu\\rho}\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\nu}\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\rho} = 0$$\n$$\\ddot{x} + \\Gamma^{x}_{tt}\\dot{t}^2 + 2\\Gamma^{x}_{tx}\\dot{t}\\dot{x} + \\Gamma^{x}_{xx}\\dot{x}^2 = 0$$\nSubstituting the nonzero Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^{x}_{xx}=1$, the equation becomes:\n$$\\ddot{x} + \\dot{x}^2 = 0$$\nThe system of geodesic equations is:\n$$ \\ddot{t} = 0 $$\n$$ \\ddot{x} + \\dot{x}^2 = 0 $$\n\n**3. Solution of Geodesic Equations**\n\nWe solve the system of ODEs with the given initial conditions.\nFirst, integrating $\\ddot{t} = 0$ yields $\\dot{t}(\\tau) = C_1$ and $t(\\tau) = C_1\\tau + C_2$.\nUsing the initial conditions $t(0)=0$ and $\\dot{t}(0)=E$:\n$\\dot{t}(0) = C_1 = E$.\n$t(0) = E(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2=0$.\nSo, the solution for $t(\\tau)$ is:\n$$t(\\tau) = E\\tau$$\n\nNext, we use the proper time normalization for a timelike curve, $g(\\dot{\\gamma},\\dot{\\gamma})=-1$:\n$$g_{\\mu\\nu}\\dot{\\gamma}^\\mu\\dot{\\gamma}^\\nu = -1 \\implies -(\\dot{t})^2 + \\exp(2x)(\\dot{x})^2 = -1$$\nThis is a first integral of the geodesic equations.

Let $v(\\tau) = \\dot{x}(\\tau)$. The equation is $\\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = -v^2$. This is separable:\n$$\\frac{dv}{v^2} = -d\\tau$$\nIntegrating both sides gives $-\\frac{1}{v} = -\\tau + C_3$, or $v(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\tau - C_3}$.\nUsing the initial condition for $\\dot{x}(0)$:\n$$v(0) = \\dot{x}(0) = \\sqrt{E^2-1} = \\frac{1}{0-C_3} \\implies C_3 = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}$$\nSo, the solution for $\\dot{x}(\\tau)$ is:\n$$\\dot{x}(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\tau + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}}$$\nTo find $x(\\tau)$, we integrate $\\dot{x}(\\tau)$ with respect to $\\tau$:\n$$x(\\tau) = \\int \\frac{1}{\\tau + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}} d\\tau = \\ln\\left|\\tau + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}\\right| + C_4$$\nUsing the initial condition $x(0)=0$:\n$$0 = \\ln\\left|0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}\\right| + C_4 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}\\right) + C_4$$\n$$C_4 = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{E^2-1}\\right)$$\nFor future-directed geodesics starting at $\\tau=0$, we consider $\\tau \\ge 0$. Since $\\sqrt{E^2-1}>0$, the argument of the logarithm is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value.\nThe solution for $x(\\tau)$ is:\n$$x(\\tau) = \\ln\\left(\\tau + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{E^2-1}\\right)$$\nUsing the property $\\ln a + \\ln b = \\ln(ab)$:\n$$x(\\tau) = \\ln\\left[\\left(\\tau + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E^2-1}}\\right)\\sqrt{E^2-1}\\right] = \\ln\\left(\\tau\\sqrt{E^2-1} + 1\\right)$$\nThe required one-parameter family of geodesics $(t(\\tau), x(\\tau))$ is given by:\n$$t(\\tau) = E\\tau$$\n$$x(\\tau) = \\ln(1 + \\tau\\sqrt{E^2-1})$$\nThe parameter of the family is $E$.

The inner product of two simple $p$-forms is the determinant of the matrix of inner products of their constituent $1$-forms.\n$$\n\\langle dt \\wedge dx, dt \\wedge dx \\rangle_g = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle dt, dt \\rangle_g & \\langle dt, dx \\rangle_g \\\\ \\langle dx, dt \\rangle_g & \\langle dx, dx \\rangle_g \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the values from the metric:\n$$\n\\langle dt \\wedge dx, dt \\wedge dx \\rangle_g = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1\n$$\nSo, the right-hand side is $(-1) \\omega = -dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$.\n\nNext, we compute the left-hand side, $(dt \\wedge dx) \\wedge (\\star(dt \\wedge dx))$.\n$$\n(dt \\wedge dx) \\wedge (A \\, dt + B \\, dx + C \\, dy) = A(dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dt) + B(dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dx) + C(dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy)\n$$\nDue to the anti-symmetric property of the wedge product (e.g., $dt \\wedge dt = 0$), the first two terms vanish:\n$$\n= 0 + 0 + C(dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) = C \\omega\n$$\n\nEquating the left-hand side and right-hand side:\n$$\nC \\omega = -1 \\cdot \\omega\n$$\nThis implies $C=-1$.\n\nTo find $A$ and $B$, we can choose other test $2$-forms.\nLet $\\beta = dx \\wedge dy$.\nThe LHS is $(dx \\wedge dy) \\wedge (A \\, dt + B \\, dx + C \\, dy) = A(dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dt) = A \\omega$.\nThe RHS is $\\langle dx \\wedge dy, dt \\wedge dx \\rangle_g \\omega$. The inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle dx \\wedge dy, dt \\wedge dx \\rangle_g = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle dx, dt \\rangle_g & \\langle dx, dx \\rangle_g \\\\ \\langle dy, dt \\rangle_g & \\langle dy, dx \\rangle_g \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nSo, $A \\omega = 0$, which implies $A=0$.\n\nLet $\\beta = dt \\wedge dy$.\nThe LHS is $(dt \\wedge dy) \\wedge (A \\, dt + B \\, dx + C \\, dy) = B(dt \\wedge dy \\wedge dx) = B(-dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) = -B \\omega$.\nThe RHS is $\\langle dt \\wedge dy, dt \\wedge dx \\rangle_g \\omega$. The inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle dt \\wedge dy, dt \\wedge dx \\rangle_g = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle dt, dt \\rangle_g & \\langle dt, dx \\rangle_g \\\\ \\langle dy, dt \\rangle_g & \\langle dy, dx \\rangle_g \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nSo, $-B \\omega = 0$, which implies $B=0$.\n\nTherefore, we have $A=0$, $B=0$, and $C=-1$. The Hodge dual is:\n$$\n\\star(dt \\wedge dx) = -dy\n$$\n\nThe sign of this result can be explicitly justified by analyzing the contributing factors:\n1.  **Lorentzian Signature**: The signature of the metric is $(-,+,+)$, meaning one basis vector of spacetime has a negative squared norm. In our case, $\\langle dt, dt \\rangle_g = -1$. When we compute the squared norm of the $2$-form $\\alpha = dt \\wedge dx$, which is a \"timelike\" $2$-form because it involves one timelike direction ($dt$) and one spacelike direction ($dx$), we get $\\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle_g = \\langle dt, dt \\rangle_g \\langle dx, dx \\rangle_g = (-1)(1) = -1$. This factor of $-1$ comes directly from the Lorentzian nature of the metric.\n\n2.  **Orientation**: The orientation is fixed by the volume form $\\omega = dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$. This choice defines the \"right-hand rule\" for the manifold's basis. The Hodge dual of $dt \\wedge dx$ must be proportional to the unique basis $1$-form \"orthogonal\" to both $dt$ and $dx$, which is $dy$. The wedge product $(dt \\wedge dx) \\wedge dy$ results in $dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$, which is the positively-oriented volume form $\\omega$.\n\nCombining these two points with the defining equation $\\alpha \\wedge (\\star \\alpha) = \\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle_g \\omega$, we substitute our forms:\n$$\n(dt \\wedge dx) \\wedge (\\star(dt \\wedge dx)) = (-1) \\cdot (dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy)\n$$\nLetting $\\star(dt \\wedge dx) = k \\cdot dy$ for some scalar $k$:\n$$\n(dt \\wedge dx) \\wedge (k \\cdot dy) = -dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n$$\nk \\cdot (dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) = -dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThe positive orientation established by $\\omega = dt \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$ means that we must have $k=-1$. The sign is thus determined by the negative sign originating from the inner product, a direct consequence of the metric's signature.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-dy}\n$$", "id": "2987608"}]}
