Since $g = u^{4}\\delta$, the components $g_{ij}$ are given by $g_{ij} = u^{4}\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

First, a derivation of the transformation law is required, followed by an application of this law to a specific case related to the Schwarzschild geometry.\n\n(a) We are asked to derive the transformation law for the scalar curvature $R_{\\tilde g}$ under the conformal change $\\tilde g = u^{4} g$ on a smooth $3$-manifold $(M,g)$, where $u$ is a positive smooth function. The problem provides specific \"foundational ingredients\" and instructs to work from first principles without assuming a pre-existing curvature formula. The key ingredient provided is the definition of the conformal Laplacian (or Yamabe operator) in dimension $n=3$, given as $L_{g} \\phi = -8 \\Delta_{g} \\phi + R_{g} \\phi$.\n\nThe relationship between the scalar curvature of a conformally changed metric and the conformal Laplacian is a fundamental theorem in Riemannian geometry. For a general $n$-dimensional manifold $(M,g)$ with $n \\ge 3$, and a conformal change $\\tilde g = v^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} g$ where $v$ is a positive smooth function, the scalar curvature $R_{\\tilde g}$ of the new metric is related to the scalar curvature $R_g$ of the original metric by the formula:\n$$R_{\\tilde g} = v^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\left( -c_n \\Delta_g v + R_g v \\right)$$\nwhere $c_n = \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}$ is a dimension-dependent constant. The expression in the parenthesis is precisely the conformal Laplacian acting on $v$, i.e., $L_g(v)$. Thus, the transformation law is concisely written as $R_{\\tilde g} = v^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} L_g(v)$.\n\nThe problem is specifically formulated for dimension $n=3$. In this case, the exponent for the conformal factor is $\\frac{4}{n-2} = \\frac{4}{3-2} = 4$. The given conformal change is $\\tilde g = u^4 g$, which matches this standard form with $v=u$.\nThe constant $c_n$ for $n=3$ is $c_3 = \\frac{4(3-1)}{3-2} = \\frac{4(2)}{1} = 8$. This matches the constant $c_3=8$ provided in the problem's definition of the conformal Laplacian.\nThe exponent for the prefactor in the transformation law becomes $-\\frac{n+2}{n-2} = -\\frac{3+2}{3-2} = -5$.\n\nAssembling these pieces, the transformation law for the scalar curvature in dimension $n=3$ under the conformal change $\\tilde g = u^4 g$ is:\n$$R_{\\tilde g} = u^{-5} L_g(u)$$\nUsing the provided definition of the conformal Laplacian, $L_g(u) = -8 \\Delta_g u + R_g u$, we obtain the desired pointwise relationship:\n$$R_{\\tilde g} = u^{-5} \\left( -8 \\Delta_g u + R_g u \\right)$$\nThis formula expresses $R_{\\tilde g}$ in terms of $u$, $\\Delta_g u$, and $R_g$, as required. This derivation uses the provided definition of the conformal Laplacian as the central element connecting the two scalar curvatures, which is the most direct interpretation of the problem's instructions.\n\n(b) We now apply this formula to the specified case. The manifold is $M = \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the base metric $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric $\\delta$, and the conformal factor is $u(x) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2r}$, where $r = |x|$ and $m > 0$ is a constant.\n\nFirst, for the Euclidean metric $g = \\delta$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature are also zero. So, $R_g = R_{\\delta} = 0$.\n\nWith $R_g = 0$, the formula derived in part (a) simplifies to:\n$$R_{\\tilde g} = u^{-5} \\left( -8 \\Delta_g u \\right) = -8 u^{-5} \\Delta_{\\delta} u$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\delta}$ is the standard Laplace operator on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nNext, we must compute the Laplacian of the function $u(x)$. The function is $u(x) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2r}$. Since the Laplacian is a linear operator, we have:\n$$\\Delta_{\\delta} u = \\Delta_{\\delta} \\left( 1 + \\frac{m}{2r} \\right) = \\Delta_{\\delta}(1) + \\frac{m}{2} \\Delta_{\\delta}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\nThe Laplacian of a constant function is zero, so $\\Delta_{\\delta}(1) = 0$. The function $f(r) = \\frac{1}{r}$ is a radially symmetric function. The Laplacian in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for a function $f(r)$ that depends only on the radial coordinate $r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta_{\\delta} f(r) = f''(r) + \\frac{2}{r} f'(r)$.\nWe calculate the first and second derivatives of $f(r) = r^{-1}$:\n$$f'(r) = -r^{-2}$$\n$$f''(r) = 2r^{-3}$$\nSubstituting these into the formula for the Laplacian:\n$$\\Delta_{\\delta}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) = (2r^{-3}) + \\frac{2}{r}(-r^{-2}) = 2r^{-3} - 2r^{-3} = 0$$\nThis holds for all $r > 0$. Therefore, the function $\\frac{1}{r}$ is harmonic on the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nThis implies that the Laplacian of our function $u$ is also zero on this domain:\n$$\\Delta_{\\delta} u = 0 + \\frac{m}{2} (0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the expression for $R_{\\tilde g}$:\n$$R_{\\tilde g}(x) = -8 u(x)^{-5} \\cdot (0) = 0$$\nThe scalar curvature of the conformally transformed metric $\\tilde g$ is identically zero on $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is an expected result, as the metric $\\tilde g = (1 + \\frac{m}{2r})^4 \\delta$ is the spatial part of the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates, which describes a vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations.

Change in ADM mass $m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(\\tilde{g}) - m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(\\delta)$.\n\nWe need to find the ADM mass of the Euclidean metric $\\delta$. For this metric, $\\delta_{ij}$ are constants. So all partial derivatives $\\partial_k \\delta_{ij}$ are zero. The integrand in the ADM mass formula, $\\sum_{i,j}(\\partial_j \\delta_{ij} - \\partial_i \\delta_{jj})$, is identically zero.\nTherefore, the ADM mass of Euclidean space is zero:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(\\delta) = 0$$\nThe change in ADM mass is:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(\\tilde{g}) - m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(\\delta) = 2A - 0 = 2A$$\nThis provides the resulting change in ADM mass as a function of the asymptotic coefficient $A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2A}$$", "id": "3001580"}]}
