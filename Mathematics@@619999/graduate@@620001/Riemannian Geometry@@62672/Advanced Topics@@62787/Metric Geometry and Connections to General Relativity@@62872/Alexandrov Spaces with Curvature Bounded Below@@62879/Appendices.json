The three triangles are $\\triangle vAB$, $\\triangle vBC$, and $\\triangle vCA$, with base lengths prescribed by $|AB|=\\sqrt{2}$, $|BC|=1$, and $|CA|=\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}}$, respectively.

We are given the side lengths: $|vA|=|vB|=|vC|=1$, $|AB|=\\sqrt{2}$, $|BC|=1$, and $|CA|=\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nFirst, we justify that $X$ is an Alexandrov space with curvature bounded below by $0$ (a CBB($0$) space). A fundamental result in Alexandrov geometry (a specialized version of Reshetnyak's gluing theorem) states that a polyhedral surface constructed by gluing a collection of Euclidean polygons is a CBB($0$) space if and only if the sum of the angles around any interior vertex is less than or equal to $2\\pi$. In the space $X$, the only point that is not locally Euclidean is the cone point $v$. All other points lie either in the interior of one of the original Euclidean triangles or on a seam formed by gluing two edges, where the total angle is $2\\pi$ and the space is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, to verify the CBB($0$) condition, we only need to compute the cone angle $\\theta(v)$ at the vertex $v$ and check if $\\theta(v) \\le 2\\pi$.\n\nThe cone angle $\\theta(v)$ is the sum of the angles at vertex $v$ from each of the three triangles. We can find each angle using the Law of Cosines in its respective Euclidean triangle.\n\n$1$. For triangle $\\triangle vAB$, the sides are $|vA|=1$, $|vB|=1$, and $|AB|=\\sqrt{2}$. Let the angle at $v$ be $\\alpha_{AB} = \\angle AvB$. The Law of Cosines states:\n$$|AB|^2 = |vA|^2 + |vB|^2 - 2|vA||vB|\\cos(\\alpha_{AB})$$\n$$(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1)(1)\\cos(\\alpha_{AB})$$\n$$2 = 2 - 2\\cos(\\alpha_{AB})$$\n$$0 = -2\\cos(\\alpha_{AB}) \\implies \\cos(\\alpha_{AB})=0$$\nThus, the angle is $\\alpha_{AB} = \\arccos(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians. This is a right-angled isosceles triangle.\n\n$2$. For triangle $\\triangle vBC$, the sides are $|vB|=1$, $|vC|=1$, and $|BC|=1$. Let the angle at $v$ be $\\alpha_{BC} = \\angle BvC$.\n$$|BC|^2 = |vB|^2 + |vC|^2 - 2|vB||vC|\\cos(\\alpha_{BC})$$\n$$1^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1)(1)\\cos(\\alpha_{BC})$$\n$$1 = 2 - 2\\cos(\\alpha_{BC})$$\n$$2\\cos(\\alpha_{BC}) = 1 \\implies \\cos(\\alpha_{BC})=\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, the angle is $\\alpha_{BC} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians. This is an equilateral triangle.\n\n$3$. For triangle $\\triangle vCA$, the sides are $|vC|=1$, $|vA|=1$, and $|CA|=\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}}$. Let the angle at $v$ be $\\alpha_{CA} = \\angle CvA$.\n$$|CA|^2 = |vC|^2 + |vA|^2 - 2|vC||vA|\\cos(\\alpha_{CA})$$\n$$(\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}})^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1)(1)\\cos(\\alpha_{CA})$$\n$$2-\\sqrt{3} = 2 - 2\\cos(\\alpha_{CA})$$\n$$-\\sqrt{3} = -2\\cos(\\alpha_{CA}) \\implies \\cos(\\alpha_{CA})=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThus, the angle is $\\alpha_{CA} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ radians.\n\nThe total cone angle $\\theta(v)$ at the vertex $v$ is the sum of these three angles:\n$$\\theta(v) = \\alpha_{AB} + \\alpha_{BC} + \\alpha_{CA} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{6}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $6$:\n$$\\theta(v) = \\frac{3\\pi}{6} + \\frac{2\\pi}{6} + \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{3\\pi+2\\pi+\\pi}{6} = \\frac{6\\pi}{6} = \\pi$$\nSince $\\theta(v) = \\pi$, which satisfies the condition $\\theta(v) \\le 2\\pi$, the space $X$ is indeed an Alexandrov space with curvature bounded below by $0$.\n\nFinally, we explain the space of directions $\\Sigma_v$ at the vertex $v$. In an Alexandrov space, the space of directions $\\Sigma_p$ at a point $p$ is the set of initial velocity vectors of geodesics starting at $p$, with a metric defined by the angle between directions. For a cone vertex $v$ in a $2$-dimensional polyhedral space, $\\Sigma_v$ is a metric space isometric to a circle whose circumference is equal to the cone angle $\\theta(v)$.\nIn this case, since $\\theta(v)=\\pi$, the space of directions $\\Sigma_v$ is a circle of total length (circumference) $\\pi$. This circle is formed by identifying the radial edges of the three angular sectors corresponding to the triangles at vertex $v$. The directions corresponding to the edge $vA$ are identified, as are those for $vB$ and $vC$, closing the loop of directions. The metric on $\\Sigma_v$ is the intrinsic path distance along this circle. A circle of length $\\pi$ is isometric to a standard circle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with radius $r$ such that $2\\pi r = \\pi$, which gives $r=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nAccording to the general theory of Alexandrov spaces, if a space is CBB($k$), its space of directions is CBB($1$). A circle of length $L$ is a CBB($1$) space if and only if $L \\le 2\\pi$. Here, the length is $\\pi$, so this condition is satisfied, consistent with the theory.\n\nThe final cone angle at the vertex $v$ is $\\pi$ radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "2968384"}, {"introduction": "Navigating an Alexandrov space often requires clever techniques, as familiar Euclidean rules may no longer apply directly.

Let $\\triangle \\tilde{p}_1 \\tilde{p}_2 \\tilde{p}_3$ be its comparison triangle in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{E}^{2}$, i.e., a triangle with the same side lengths. For any point $m$ on the geodesic $[p_1 p_2]$, let $\\tilde{m}$ be the corresponding point on the side $[\\tilde{p}_1 \\tilde{p}_2]$ such that $d(p_1,m) = d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\tilde{p}_1,\\tilde{m})$. The CBB(0) condition is $d(p_3, m) \\geq d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\tilde{p}_3, \\tilde{m})$.\n\nThe space $X = \\mathbb{R}^2/\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$ is isometric to the closed upper half-plane $H = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y \\ge 0\\}$. Let $\\triangle p_1 p_2 p_3$ be an arbitrary geodesic triangle in $X$. We can lift this triangle to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. By choosing appropriate lifts, we can construct a Euclidean triangle $\\triangle P_1' P_2' P_3'$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ whose side lengths are precisely the geodesic distances $d_X(p_1, p_2)$, $d_X(p_2, p_3)$, and $d_X(p_3, p_1)$. This is the \"unfolding\" of the geodesic triangle from $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe Euclidean comparison triangle $\\triangle \\tilde{p}_1 \\tilde{p}_2 \\tilde{p}_3$ is, by definition, a triangle in $\\mathbb{E}^2$ with the same side lengths as $\\triangle p_1 p_2 p_3$. Therefore, it is congruent to the unfolded triangle $\\triangle P_1' P_2' P_3'$.\n\nLet $m$ be a point on the geodesic $[p_1 p_2]$. Its corresponding point in the unfolded triangle is a point $M$ on the segment $[P_1' P_2']$. The distance $d_X(p_3, m)$ is the length of the geodesic from $p_3$ to $m$, which equals the Euclidean distance $d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(P_3', M)$. The distance in the comparison triangle is $d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\tilde{p}_3, \\tilde{m})$. Since the comparison triangle is congruent to the unfolded triangle, $d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\tilde{p}_3, \\tilde{m}) = d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(P_3', M)$.\n\nTherefore, for any triangle and any points on its sides, we have $d_X(p_3, m) = d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\tilde{p}_3, \\tilde{m})$. This equality satisfies the CBB(0) condition $d_X(p_3, m) \\geq d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\tilde{p}_3, \\tilde{m})$. Thus, $X$ has curvature bounded below by $0$. (In fact, since equality always holds, it is also a CAT(0) space).\n\n**Part 3: Alexandrov Angle Calculation**\n\nThe Alexandrov angle at a vertex of a geodesic triangle in a CBB($k$) space is defined as the angle at the corresponding vertex of the comparison triangle in the model space $M_k^2$. For CBB($0$), the model space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nWe have the side lengths for the geodesic triangle $\\triangle\\bar{P}\\bar{Q}\\bar{R}$:\n$c = d_X(\\bar{P}, \\bar{Q}) = 3$ (opposite $\\bar{R}$)\n$b = d_X(\\bar{P}, \\bar{R}) = \\sqrt{2}$ (opposite $\\bar{Q}$)\n$a = d_X(\\bar{Q}, \\bar{R}) = \\sqrt{5}$ (opposite $\\bar{P}$)\n\nWe want to compute the Alexandrov angle at $\\bar{R}$, denoted $\\theta_{\\bar{R}}$. This is the angle at the vertex $\\tilde{R}$ in the Euclidean comparison triangle $\\triangle\\tilde{P}\\tilde{Q}\\tilde{R}$ with side lengths $a=\\sqrt{5}$, $b=\\sqrt{2}$, and $c=3$. Using the Law of Cosines for the angle at $\\tilde{R}$:\n$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\theta_{\\bar{R}})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$3^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{2})^2 - 2(\\sqrt{5})(\\sqrt{2}) \\cos(\\theta_{\\bar{R}})$$\n$$9 = 5 + 2 - 2\\sqrt{10} \\cos(\\theta_{\\bar{R}})$$\n$$9 = 7 - 2\\sqrt{10} \\cos(\\theta_{\\bar{R}})$$\n$$2 = -2\\sqrt{10} \\cos(\\theta_{\\bar{R}})$$\n$$\\cos(\\theta_{\\bar{R}}) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}$$\nThe angle is therefore:\n$$\\theta_{\\bar{R}} = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\right)$$\n\nAlternatively, we can compute this angle more directly. The angle at $\\bar{R}$ is the angle between the geodesics $[\\bar{R}\\bar{P}]$ and $[\\bar{R}\\bar{Q}]$. The geodesic $[\\bar{R}\\bar{P}]$ is the projection of the segment from $\\sigma(R)=(1,1)$ to $P=(0,2)$. The geodesic $[\\bar{R}\\bar{Q}]$ is the projection of the segment from $\\sigma(R)=(1,1)$ to $Q=(3,2)$.\nThe angle between these geodesics at $\\bar{R}$ is the angle between the two segments meeting at the common lift point $\\sigma(R)=(1,1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let this common lift point be $R'=(1,1)$.\nThe direction vector for the segment $[R'P]$ is $\\vec{v}_1 = P - R' = (0,2) - (1,1) = (-1, 1)$.\nThe direction vector for the segment $[R'Q]$ is $\\vec{v}_2 = Q - R' = (3,2) - (1,1) = (2, 1)$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ between these vectors is given by the dot product formula: $\\vec{v}_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}_2 = \\|\\vec{v}_1\\| \\|\\vec{v}_2\\| \\cos(\\theta)$.\n$\\vec{v}_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}_2 = (-1)(2) + (1)(1) = -1$.\n$\\|\\vec{v}_1\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.

The point $\\bar{m}_{xy}$ is the midpoint of the side $[\\bar{x},\\bar{y}]$, and $\\bar{m}_{xz}$ is the midpoint of the side $[\\bar{x},\\bar{z}]$.\n\nIn the Euclidean triangle $\\triangle(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})$, the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides, $[\\bar{m}_{xy}, \\bar{m}_{xz}]$, is parallel to the third side, $[\\bar{y},\\bar{z}]$, and its length is half the length of the third side. This is a fundamental result in Euclidean geometry known as the Triangle Midsegment Theorem.\n\nTherefore, the length of the segment $[\\bar{m}_{xy}, \\bar{m}_{xz}]$ is half the length of $[\\bar{y},\\bar{z}]$:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{m}_{xy},\\bar{m}_{xz}) = \\frac{1}{2} d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{y},\\bar{z}) = \\frac{a}{2}$$\nThis expression depends only on the side length $a$. The expression $\\frac{a}{2}$ is the closed-form analytic expression that serves as the common bound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{a}{2}}$$", "id": "3025149"}]}
