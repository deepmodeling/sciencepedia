It is scientifically grounded in the established framework of general relativity and cosmology, specifically the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric and the Einstein-de Sitter model. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It represents a standard, non-trivial exercise in demonstrating the concept of a cosmological singularity and timelike geodesic incompleteness.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, addressing each of the three tasks in order. The spacetime is described by the line element\n$$\nds^{2}=-dt^{2}+a(t)^{2}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}\\right)\n$$\nwith the scale factor $a(t)=A\\,t^{2/3}$ for $t0$ and a constant $A0$. Units are chosen such that $c=1$.\n\nFirst, we establish whether the comoving curve $\\gamma$, defined by constant spatial coordinates $x=x_{0}$, $y=y_{0}$, $z=z_{0}$, is a timelike geodesic.\nThe geodesic equation is given by\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}x^{\\mu}}{d\\lambda^{2}} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} \\frac{dx^{\\alpha}}{d\\lambda} \\frac{dx^{\\beta}}{d\\lambda} = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is an affine parameter. For a timelike curve, the proper time $\\tau$ can serve as an affine parameter.\nThe components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are $g_{00}=-1$, $g_{11}=g_{22}=g_{33}=a(t)^{2}$, and all off-diagonal components are zero. The inverse metric is $g^{00}=-1$, $g^{11}=g^{22}=g^{33}=a(t)^{-2}$.\nThe required Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu\\sigma} (\\partial_\\alpha g_{\\sigma\\beta} + \\partial_\\beta g_{\\sigma\\alpha} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\alpha\\beta})$ are calculated. The only non-zero derivatives of the metric are with respect to $t$ (index $0$).\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}_{ij} = a(t)\\dot{a}(t)\\delta_{ij} \\quad (i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\})\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^{i}_{0j} = \\Gamma^{i}_{j0} = \\frac{\\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\\delta^{i}_{j} \\quad (i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\})\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{a} = \\frac{da}{dt}$. All other components, including $\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{00}$ for all $\\mu$, are zero.\n\nThe curve $\\gamma$ is parameterized by the coordinate time $t$ as $x^{\\mu}(t) = (t, x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$. The tangent vector with respect to $t$ is $\\frac{dx^{\\mu}}{dt} = (1, 0, 0, 0)$. The proper time $\\tau$ along this curve is found from $d\\tau^{2} = -ds^{2}$. For $\\gamma$, $dx=dy=dz=0$, so $ds^{2} = -dt^{2}$. This gives $d\\tau^{2} = dt^{2}$, and taking the positive root, $d\\tau = dt$. Thus, the cosmological time $t$ is the proper time for a comoving observer (up to an additive constant, which we can set to zero).\nLet's choose the affine parameter to be the proper time $\\lambda=\\tau=t$. The tangent four-velocity is $u^{\\mu} = \\frac{dx^{\\mu}}{d\\tau} = (1, 0, 0, 0)$. The squared norm of this vector is $g_{\\mu\\nu}u^{\\mu}u^{\\nu} = g_{00}u^{0}u^{0} = (-1)(1)^{2} = -1$, which confirms the curve is timelike.\n\nNow we check the geodesic equation. Since $u^{\\mu}$ is a constant vector, its derivative with respect to the parameter $\\tau=t$ is zero: $\\frac{du^{\\mu}}{d\\tau} = 0$. The geodesic equation simplifies to $\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} u^{\\alpha} u^{\\beta} = 0$. Since $u^{i}=0$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, this further reduces to:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{00} (u^{0})^{2} = \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{00} (1)^{2} = \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{00} = 0.\n$$\nWe must check this for each component $\\mu=0,1,2,3$. As established from our calculation of the Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{00}=0$ for all $\\mu$. The geodesic equation is satisfied. Therefore, the comoving curve $\\gamma$ is a timelike geodesic.\n\nSecond, we compute the total proper time that elapses along $\\gamma$ from $t=t_{0}$ backward to $t=0$.\nThe elapsed proper time $\\Delta\\tau$ along a path is the integral of $d\\tau$. As we found that $d\\tau = dt$ for the curve $\\gamma$, the total proper time from $t=0$ to $t_0$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t_{0}} d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t_{0}} dt = [t]_{0}^{t_{0}} = t_{0}.\n$$\nThis is the proper time interval corresponding to the cosmological time interval $[0, t_{0}]$ as measured by a comoving observer.\n\nThird, we use a curvature invariant to explain the geodesic incompleteness to the past. A convenient invariant is the Ricci scalar, $R = g^{\\mu\\nu}R_{\\mu\\nu}$. For a spatially flat ($k=0$) FLRW metric, the Ricci scalar is given by:\n$$\nR = 6\\left(\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a} + \\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^{2}\\right).\n$$\nWe are given the scale factor $a(t) = A\\,t^{2/3}$. Its derivatives are:\n$$\n\\dot{a}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(A\\,t^{2/3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}A\\,t^{-1/3}\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{a}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}A\\,t^{-1/3}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{9}A\\,t^{-4/3}\n$$\nWe compute the terms in the expression for $R$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}A\\,t^{-1/3}}{A\\,t^{2/3}} = \\frac{2}{3}t^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{9}A\\,t^{-4/3}}{A\\,t^{2/3}} = -\\frac{2}{9}t^{-2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the formula for the Ricci scalar:\n$$\nR = 6\\left(-\\frac{2}{9}t^{-2} + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}t^{-1}\\right)^{2}\\right) = 6\\left(-\\frac{2}{9}t^{-2} + \\frac{4}{9}t^{-2}\\right) = 6\\left(\\frac{2}{9}t^{-2}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}t^{-2}.\n$$\nAs the cosmological time $t$ approaches zero from above ($t \\to 0^{+}$), the Ricci scalar diverges:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} R(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{4}{3t^{2}} = \\infty.\n$$\nThe divergence of a scalar invariant of the curvature tensor indicates a true physical singularity, not a coordinate artifact. The spacetime manifold is defined to be smooth, which requires all geometric quantities to be finite. The divergence at $t=0$ means that this point is not part of the manifold, and the spacetime cannot be smoothly extended to or beyond $t=0$. This is the initial \"Big Bang\" singularity.\n\nA geodesic is defined to be incomplete if it cannot be extended to arbitrary values of its affine parameter. For the timelike geodesic $\\gamma$, the affine parameter is the proper time $\\tau=t$. An observer following this geodesic backwards from an event at $t=t_0$ reaches the boundary of the spacetime at $t=0$ after a finite proper time of $t_0$. Since the geodesic cannot be continued to $\\tau \\to -\\infty$ (as it terminates at $\\tau=0$), it is past-timelike-geodesically incomplete. This incompleteness is a direct physical consequence of the curvature singularity at $t=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{t_{0}}$$", "id": "3003828"}, {"introduction": "While cosmological singularities lie in the past, the theorems also predict the formation of future singularities from gravitational collapse.

For our congruence, this means we must have $R_{ab} u^a u^b \\ge 0$.\n\nWe use the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) with $\\Lambda=0$, $R_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{ab} = 8\\pi G T_{ab}$, to relate $R_{ab} u^a u^b$ to the matter content. The stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid is $T_{ab} = (\\rho + p) u_a u_b + p g_{ab}$.\nA more direct form of the EFE is $R_{ab} = 8\\pi G (T_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} T g_{ab})$, where $T = g^{cd}T_{cd}$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor. For the perfect fluid, $T = g^{ab}((\\rho+p)u_a u_b + p g_{ab}) = (\\rho+p)u^a u_a + p g^{ab}g_{ab} = -(\\rho+p) + 4p = 3p - \\rho$.\nNow, we contract $R_{ab}$ with $u^a u^b$:\n$$\nR_{ab} u^a u^b = 8\\pi G \\left( T_{ab}u^a u^b - \\frac{1}{2} T g_{ab}u^a u^b \\right)\n$$\nWe compute the contractions:\n-   $T_{ab}u^a u^b = ((\\rho + p) u_a u_b + p g_{ab})u^a u^b = (\\rho + p)(u_a u^a)(u_b u^b) + p(g_{ab}u^a u^b) = (\\rho+p)(-1)(-1) + p(-1) = \\rho$.\n-   $g_{ab}u^a u^b = u_a u^a = -1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R_{ab}u^a u^b$:\n$$\nR_{ab}u^a u^b = 8\\pi G \\left(\\rho - \\frac{1}{2}(3p - \\rho)(-1)\\right) = 8\\pi G \\left(\\rho + \\frac{3}{2}p - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\right) = 8\\pi G \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho + \\frac{3}{2}p\\right) = 4\\pi G (\\rho + 3p)\n$$\nThe sign constraint required by the SEC, $R_{ab} u^a u^b \\ge 0$, becomes:\n$$\n4\\pi G (\\rho + 3p) \\ge 0\n$$\nGiven that $G  0$ and we assume $\\rho \\ge 0$, this requires $\\rho + 3p \\ge 0$.\nNow, using the equation of state $p = w \\rho$, the condition is:\n$$\n\\rho + 3(w\\rho) \\ge 0 \\implies \\rho(1+3w) \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $\\rho \\ge 0$ (and $\\rho0$ for a non-trivial spacetime), the condition for Hawking's theorem assumptions to hold is $1+3w \\ge 0$, which implies $w \\ge -\\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe minimal value of $w$ is therefore $w_{min} = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Part 2: Upper Bound on Past Proper Time**\n\nWith the SEC ($R_{ab} u^a u^b \\ge 0$), the Raychaudhuri equation implies the focusing inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\le -\\frac{1}{3}\\theta^2\n$$\nWe wish to find an upper bound on the time elapsed since a past singularity. A singularity corresponds to an infinite expansion rate, $\\theta \\to \\infty$. Let the present time at the Cauchy surface be $t_0$, where $\\theta(t_0) = \\theta_0  0$. We integrate the inequality backward in time from $t_0$ to a past time $t_s$ corresponding to the singularity.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{\\theta^2} \\le -\\frac{1}{3} dt\n$$\nIntegrating from $t_s$ to $t_0$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\theta(t_s)}^{\\theta(t_0)} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\theta^2} \\le \\int_{t_s}^{t_0} -\\frac{1}{3} dt\n$$\nWe take the limit $\\theta(t_s) \\to \\infty$ for the singularity.\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\right]_{\\infty}^{\\theta_0} \\le -\\frac{1}{3} [t]_{t_s}^{t_0}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} - \\lim_{\\theta\\to\\infty}\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right) \\le -\\frac{1}{3}(t_0 - t_s)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\le -\\frac{1}{3}(t_0 - t_s)\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\ge \\frac{1}{3}(t_0 - t_s)\n$$\nThe past proper-time length is $\\Delta \\tau_{past} = t_0 - t_s$. The inequality gives an upper bound on this duration:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tau_{past} \\le \\frac{3}{\\theta_0}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Exact Past Proper Time for $w = -1/3$**\n\nFor the borderline case $w = -1/3$, the SEC becomes an equality: $\\rho + 3p = \\rho + 3(-\\frac{1}{3}\\rho) = 0$. This implies $R_{ab} u^a u^b = 0$. The Raychaudhuri equation becomes the exact equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\theta^2\n$$\nWe can solve this to find the exact past proper time. Following the same integration as above, but with equality:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} = -\\frac{1}{3}(t_0 - t_s) \\implies t_0 - t_s = \\frac{3}{\\theta_0}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can solve the Friedmann equations for this case. The first Friedmann equation for a spatially flat ($k=0$) universe with $\\Lambda=0$ is:\n$$\nH^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho\n$$\nThe conservation equation $\\dot{\\rho} + 3H(\\rho+p) = 0$ with $p = -\\frac{1}{3}\\rho$ becomes $\\dot{\\rho} + 3H(\\rho-\\frac{1}{3}\\rho) = \\dot{\\rho} + 2H\\rho = 0$.\nSo $\\frac{\\dot{\\rho}}{\\rho} = -2 \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}$, which integrates to $\\rho \\propto a^{-2}$. Let $\\rho(t) = C a(t)^{-2}$ for some constant $C$.\nSubstituting this into the Friedmann equation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\frac{C}{a^2} \\implies \\dot{a}^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G C}{3} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThis implies $\\dot{a} = \\text{const}$, and so $\\ddot{a} = 0$. This is consistent with the second Friedmann equation, $\\ddot{a}/a = -\\frac{4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho+3p)$, which is zero for $w = -1/3$.\nIntegrating $\\dot{a} = \\text{const}$ with the initial condition that the singularity ($a=0$) occurs at $t=0$, we get $a(t) \\propto t$.\nThe Hubble parameter is $H(t) = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\frac{\\text{const}}{\\text{const} \\cdot t} = \\frac{1}{t}$.\nThe expansion scalar is $\\theta(t) = 3H(t) = \\frac{3}{t}$.\nAt the Cauchy surface at time $t_0$, we have $\\theta_0 = \\theta(t_0) = \\frac{3}{t_0}$.\nThe past proper time from the Cauchy surface back to the singularity at $t=0$ is exactly $t_0$. Therefore, the exact past proper-time length is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tau_{past} = t_0 = \\frac{3}{\\theta_0}\n$$\nThis confirms the result from the Raychaudhuri equation, showing that the upper bound is saturated in the borderline case.\n\nThe final answer requires the pair $(w_{min}, \\Delta \\tau_{past}|_{w=-1/3})$.\n-   Minimal allowed $w$: $-\\frac{1}{3}$\n-   Exact past proper-time length for $w = -1/3$: $\\frac{3}{\\theta_0}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{3}{\\theta_0} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3003793"}]}
