We will proceed by addressing the three parts of the problem in sequence. The solution requires the application of the theory of Riemannian submersions, particularly O'Neill's fundamental tensors and curvature formulas.\n\n(a) Computation of the O'Neill tensors $A^t$ and $T^t$.\n\nLet $\\pi \\colon (P, g_t) \\to (B, g_B)$ be the Riemannian submersion. The tangent space at any point $p \\in P$ decomposes orthogonally as $T_p P = \\mathcal{H}_p \\oplus \\mathcal{V}_p$, where the horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}_p = \\ker(\\theta_p)$ and the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_p = \\text{span}(V_p)$. The vertical unit vector field is $U_t = V/t$.\n\nThe O'Neill tensor $T$ is defined for vertical vector fields $E, F$ by $T_E F = \\mathcal{H}(\\nabla_E F)$, where $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $g_t$. Since the vertical distribution $\\mathcal{V}$ is one-dimensional, spanned by $U_t$, we only need to compute $T_{U_t} U_t = \\mathcal{H}(\\nabla_{U_t} U_t)$.\nFirst, we compute $\\nabla_V V$. The principal connection $\\theta$ is $S^1$-invariant, and the base metric $g_B$ is fixed, so the metric $g_t = \\pi^*g_B + t^2 \\theta \\otimes \\theta$ is invariant under the $S^1$-action generated by $V$. This means $V$ is a Killing vector field for $g_t$, i.e., $L_V g_t = 0$. For any Killing field $K$, we have the identity $g(\\nabla_X K, Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(L_K g)(X,Y)$ for all vector fields $X,Y$. Applying this to $K=V$ and $X=V$, we get $g_t(\\nabla_V V, Z) = \\frac{1}{2}(L_V g_t)(V,Z) = 0$ for any vector field $Z$. This implies $\\nabla_V V = 0$.\nConsequently, $\\nabla_{U_t} U_t = \\nabla_{V/t} (V/t) = \\frac{1}{t^2}\\nabla_V V = 0$.\nSince $\\nabla_{U_t} U_t=0$, its horizontal part is also zero: $T_{U_t} U_t = \\mathcal{H}(0) = 0$. Thus, the tensor $T^t$ is identically zero. This geometric property means the fibers (integral curves of $V$) are geodesics.\n\nThe O'Neill tensor $A$ is defined for a horizontal vector field $X$ and any vector field $E$ by $A_X E = \\mathcal{V}(\\nabla_X E)$. We are asked for $A^t_X Y$ where $X, Y$ are horizontal. A fundamental formula for Riemannian submersions states that for horizontal $X, Y$, $A_X Y = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{V}([X,Y])$.\nThe vertical part of the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ can be computed using the curvature form $\\Omega=d\\theta$. For horizontal fields $X, Y$, we have $d\\theta(X,Y) = X(\\theta(Y)) - Y(\\theta(X)) - \\theta([X,Y]) = -\\theta([X,Y])$.\nThe vertical component of a vector $Z$ is given by $\\mathcal{V}(Z) = g_t(Z, U_t)U_t$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{V}([X,Y]) = g_t([X,Y], U_t) U_t = g_t([X,Y], V/t) U_t = \\frac{1}{t} g_t([X,Y], V) U_t$.\nUsing the definition of $g_t$, $g_t([X,Y], V) = \\pi^*g_B([X,Y],V) + t^2\\theta([X,Y])\\theta(V) = 0 + t^2(-\\Omega(X,Y))(1) = -t^2\\Omega(X,Y)$.\nThus, $\\mathcal{V}([X,Y]) = \\frac{1}{t}(-t^2\\Omega(X,Y)) U_t = -t\\Omega(X,Y)U_t$.\nFinally, we obtain the expression for $A^t_X Y$:\n$$ A^t_X Y = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{V}([X,Y]) = -\\frac{t}{2}\\Omega(X,Y)U_t. $$\n\n(b) Derivation of sectional curvature expressions.\n\nWe use O'Neill's curvature formulas for a Riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers ($T=0$).\n\nFor a horizontal plane spanned by $g_t$-orthonormal horizontal vectors $X, Y$, the formula is:\n$$ \\sec_{g_t}(X,Y) = \\sec_{g_B}(X_*, Y_*) - 3|A_X Y|^2_{g_t}. $$\nHere $X_*, Y_*$ are the projections of $X, Y$ to $B$. We identify horizontal vectors with their projections.\nWe compute the squared norm of $A_X Y$:\n$$ |A_X Y|^2_{g_t} = g_t\\left(-\\frac{t}{2}\\Omega(X,Y)U_t, -\\frac{t}{2}\\Omega(X,Y)U_t\\right) = \\frac{t^2}{4}\\Omega(X,Y)^2 g_t(U_t, U_t) = \\frac{t^2}{4}\\Omega(X,Y)^2. $$\nSubstituting this into the curvature formula, we get:\n$$ \\sec_{g_t}(X,Y) = \\sec_{g_B}(X,Y) - \\frac{3t^2}{4}\\Omega(X,Y)^2. $$\n\nFor a mixed plane spanned by a $g_t$-unit horizontal vector $X$ and the vertical unit vector $U_t$, the sectional curvature is given by $\\sec_{g_t}(X, U_t) = |(\\nabla_X U_t)^h|^2_{g_t}$. Let's denote the shape operator $S_X = (\\nabla_X U_t)^h$. We need to compute its norm.\nFor any horizontal vector $Y$, we have:\n$$ g_t(S_X, Y) = g_t(\\nabla_X U_t, Y) = -g_t(U_t, \\nabla_X Y). $$\nThe vertical part of $\\nabla_X Y$ is $A_X Y$. Since $Y$ is horizontal, $\\nabla_X Y$ is orthogonal to $Y$ only if $X,Y$ are parts of a parallel field. In general, $g_t(U_t, \\nabla_X Y) \\neq 0$.\n$g_t(U_t, \\nabla_X Y) = g_t(U_t, (\\nabla_X Y)^h + A_X Y) = g_t(U_t, A_X Y) = g_t\\left(U_t, -\\frac{t}{2}\\Omega(X,Y)U_t\\right) = -\\frac{t}{2}\\Omega(X,Y)$.\nSo, $g_t(S_X, Y) = \\frac{t}{2}\\Omega(X,Y)$.\nLet $\\{e_i\\}$ be a $g_B$-orthonormal (and thus $g_t$-orthonormal) basis for the horizontal space at a point. The squared norm of $S_X$ is:\n$$ |S_X|^2_{g_t} = \\sum_i g_t(S_X, e_i)^2 = \\sum_i \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\Omega(X,e_i)\\right)^2 = \\frac{t^2}{4}\\sum_i \\Omega(X,e_i)^2. $$\nThus, the sectional curvature of a mixed plane is:\n$$ \\sec_{g_t}(X, U_t) = \\frac{t^2}{4}\\sum_i \\Omega(X,e_i)^2. $$\n\n(c) Derivation of a uniform upper bound.\n\nWe need to find an upper bound for $|\\sec_{g_t}(\\sigma)|$ for an arbitrary $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p P$. For a Riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers, the sectional curvature function on the Grassmannian of $2$-planes at a point $p$ attains its extreme values on planes that are either purely horizontal or mixed. Therefore, we can find the uniform bound by taking the maximum of the bounds for these two cases.\n\nBound for horizontal planes: For any $g_t$-orthonormal horizontal pair $X, Y$,\n$$ |\\sec_{g_t}(X,Y)| = \\left|\\sec_{g_B}(X,Y) - \\frac{3t^2}{4}\\Omega(X,Y)^2\\right| \\le |\\sec_{g_B}(X,Y)| + \\frac{3t^2}{4}\\Omega(X,Y)^2. $$\nUsing the given global bounds $|K_B| \\le \\kappa_0$ and $|\\Omega| \\le \\Lambda_0$, we have $|\\sec_{g_B}(X,Y)| \\le \\kappa_0$. The operator norm $|\\Omega|$ is defined as $\\sup |\\Omega(X,Y)|$ over all orthonormal pairs $X,Y$ in $T_{\\pi(p)}B$. Thus, $\\Omega(X,Y)^2 \\le |\\Omega|^2 \\le \\Lambda_0^2$.\nSo, for any horizontal plane,\n$$ |\\sec_{g_t}(X,Y)| \\le \\kappa_0 + \\frac{3t^2}{4}\\Lambda_0^2. $$\n\nBound for mixed planes: For a unit horizontal vector $X$, the curvature is non-negative:\n$$ |\\sec_{g_t}(X, U_t)| = \\sec_{g_t}(X, U_t) = \\frac{t^2}{4}\\sum_i \\Omega(X,e_i)^2. $$\nThe term $\\sum_i \\Omega(X,e_i)^2$ is the squared norm of the $1$-form $\\Omega(X, \\cdot)|_{\\mathcal{H}}$ with respect to $g_B$. The supremum of this quantity over all unit vectors $X$ is the squared operator norm of $\\Omega$. That is, $\\sup_{X, |X|=1} \\sum_i \\Omega(X,e_i)^2 = |\\Omega|^2$.\nTherefore,\n$$ |\\sec_{g_t}(X, U_t)| \\le \\frac{t^2}{4}|\\Omega|^2 \\le \\frac{t^2}{4}\\Lambda_0^2. $$\n\nThe overall uniform upper bound $C(t; \\kappa_0, \\Lambda_0)$ is the maximum of the two bounds derived:\n$$ C(t; \\kappa_0, \\Lambda_0) = \\max\\left( \\kappa_0 + \\frac{3t^2}{4}\\Lambda_0^2, \\quad \\frac{t^2}{4}\\Lambda_0^2 \\right). $$\nSince $\\kappa_0 \\ge 0$ and $\\Lambda_0 \\ge 0$, and $\\frac{3}{4} > 0$, the first term $\\kappa_0 + \\frac{3t^2}{4}\\Lambda_0^2$ is always greater than or equal to the second term.\nThus, the single explicit uniform upper bound is:\n$$ C(t; \\kappa_0, \\Lambda_0) = \\kappa_0 + \\frac{3t^2}{4}\\Lambda_0^2. $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\kappa_{0} + \\frac{3t^{2}}{4}\\Lambda_{0}^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2971433"}, {"introduction": "Having seen a well-behaved collapse, it is crucial to understand the failure modes.

The structure described is that of a Riemannian submersion $\\pi : (M_{\\varepsilon},g_{\\varepsilon}) \\to (B,g_{B})$, where the fibers are circles. We are instructed to use the standard framework of Riemannian submersions.\n\nThe key tool for this problem is O'Neill's formula for the sectional curvature of a horizontal plane. Let $U$ and $V$ be vector fields on the base manifold $B$, and let $U^H$ and $V^H$ be their horizontal lifts to the total space $M$. The sectional curvature $K_{M}$ of the plane spanned by $U^H$ and $V^H$ is related to the sectional curvature $K_{B}$ of the plane spanned by $U$ and $V$ by:\n$$\nK_{M}(U^H, V^H) = K_{B}(U,V) - \\frac{3}{4} g_{M}\\left([U^H, V^H]^{\\mathcal{V}}, [U^H, V^H]^{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $[U^H, V^H]^{\\mathcal{V}}$ is the vertical component of the Lie bracket $[U^H, V^H]$. This formula applies when the fibers of the submersion are totally geodesic, which is the case here as the metric on the fibers is constant along the base.\n\nThe Riemann curvature component $R(U,V,V,U)$ is related to the sectional curvature $K(U,V)$ by the definition:\n$$\nK(U,V) = \\frac{R(U,V,V,U)}{g(U,U)g(V,V) - (g(U,V))^2}\n$$\nThe vector fields $X = \\partial_x$ and $Y = \\partial_y$ form an orthonormal set in $(B, g_B)$. Their horizontal lifts, $X^H$ and $Y^H$, are orthonormal with respect to $g_{\\varepsilon}$. Specifically, for a connection metric like $g_\\varepsilon$, we have $g_{\\varepsilon}(X^H, Y^H) = g_{B}(X,Y) = 0$, $g_{\\varepsilon}(X^H, X^H) = g_{B}(X,X) = 1$, and $g_{\\varepsilon}(Y^H, Y^H) = g_{B}(Y,Y) = 1$.

Thus, the sectional curvature $K_B(X,Y)$ for any plane is:\n$$\nK_B(X,Y) = K_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(\\partial_x, \\partial_y) = 0\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the horizontal lifts $X^H$ and $Y^H$. A vector field on $M_\\varepsilon$ is horizontal if it lies in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\varepsilon} = \\ker(\\alpha_{\\varepsilon})$.\nLet $X = \\partial_x$. Its horizontal lift $X^H$ is of the form $X^H = \\partial_x + c(x,y,\\theta)\\partial_\\theta$ to satisfy $\\pi_*(X^H) = X$. The horizontality condition $\\alpha_\\varepsilon(X^H) = 0$ determines the function $c$.\nThe connection $1$-form is $\\alpha_{\\varepsilon} = d\\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\varepsilon^{-2}\\,(x\\,dy - y\\,dx)$.

Thus, the horizontal lift of $X=\\partial_x$ is:\n$$\nX^H = \\partial_x + \\frac{y}{2\\varepsilon^2}\\partial_\\theta\n$$\nSimilarly, for $Y = \\partial_y$, its lift is $Y^H = \\partial_y + c'\\partial_\\theta$.

For any vector $X = X_B + X_F$ (where $X_B$ is tangent to $B$ and $X_F$ to $F$) and any vertical vector $V = V_F$, their inner product is $g_{\\epsilon}(X, V) = g_B(X_B, 0) + \\epsilon^2 g_F(\\epsilon)(X_F, V_F) = \\epsilon^2 g_F(\\epsilon)(X_F, V_F)$. For $X$ to be horizontal, this must be zero for all $V_F$, which implies $X_F = 0$. Thus, $\\mathcal{H}$ consists of vectors tangent to the base $B \\times \\{f\\}$. The distributions $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ are the tangent bundles of $B$ and $F$, respectively, and are orthogonal. This means $(M, g_{\\epsilon})$ is a Riemannian product of $(B, g_B)$ and $(F, \\epsilon^2 g_F(\\epsilon))$.\n\nThe geometry of a Riemannian submersion is described by two tensors, the O'Neill tensors $A$ and $T$. For horizontal vector fields $X, Y$ and vertical vector fields $V, W$, they are defined as $A_X Y = \\mathcal{V}(\\nabla_X Y)$ and $T_V W = \\mathcal{H}(\\nabla_V W)$, where $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection on $(M, g_\\epsilon)$ and $\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{V}$ denote projection onto the respective distributions.\n\nFor a Riemannian product, both tensors vanish. To see this, let $X, Y$ be horizontal fields and $U$ be a vertical field. From the Koszul formula, $2 g_{\\epsilon}(\\nabla_X Y, U) = X g_{\\epsilon}(Y,U) + Y g_{\\epsilon}(X,U) - U g_{\\epsilon}(X,Y) + g_{\\epsilon}([X,Y], U) - g_{\\epsilon}([X,U], Y) - g_{\\epsilon}([Y,U], X)$. Since $X,Y$ are horizontal lifts from $B$ and $U$ is a vertical lift from $F$, we have $g_{\\epsilon}(Y,U)=0$, $g_{\\epsilon}(X,U)=0$, $[X,U]=0$, $[Y,U]=0$, and $[X,Y]$ is horizontal. Also, $g_{\\epsilon}(X,Y)$ only depends on the base coordinate $t$, so $U(g_{\\epsilon}(X,Y)) = 0$. This implies $g_{\\epsilon}(\\nabla_X Y, U)=0$, so $\\nabla_X Y$ is horizontal, and thus $A=0$. Similarly, for vertical $V, W$ and horizontal $H$, we find $g_{\\epsilon}(\\nabla_V W, H) = 0$, so $\\nabla_V W$ is vertical and $T=0$.\n\nO'Neill's curvature formulas relate the curvature of $M$ to that of the base $B$ and the fibers $F$. The sectional curvature of a vertical plane spanned by an orthonormal pair of vertical vectors $V, W$ is given by\n$$K_M(V,W) = K_F(V,W) + \\|T_V W\\|_{g_{\\epsilon}}^2 - g_{\\epsilon}(T_V V, T_W W)$$\nwhere $K_F$ is the sectional curvature of the fiber. As $T=0$ for our product manifold, the sectional curvature of any vertical plane in $(M,g_\\epsilon)$ is identical to its sectional curvature within the fiber, endowed with the fiber metric $g_{f} = \\epsilon^2 g_F(\\epsilon)$. That is, $K_M(V,W) = K_F(V,W)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the sectional curvature of the vertical $2$-plane spanned by the vector fields corresponding to $F_1$ and $F_2$. We must therefore compute this curvature on the fiber $(F, g_{f})$.\nThe given frame $\\{F_1, F_2, F_3\\}$ is orthonormal for $g_F(\\epsilon)$. With respect to the fiber metric $g_{f} = \\epsilon^2 g_F(\\epsilon)$, we have $g_{f}(F_i, F_j) = \\epsilon^2 g_F(\\epsilon)(F_i, F_j) = \\epsilon^2 \\delta_{ij}$.\nTo compute sectional curvature, we need an orthonormal frame for $(F, g_{f})$. Let $E_i = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} F_i$. Then $g_{f}(E_i, E_j) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2} g_{f}(F_i, F_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The set $\\{E_1, E_2, E_3\\}$ is a left-invariant orthonormal frame for $(F, g_f)$.\n\nThe Lie algebra structure is given by $[F_1, F_2] = \\lambda(\\epsilon) F_3$ and cyclic permutations being zero. In the new frame $\\{E_i\\}$:\n$$\n[E_1, E_2] = \\left[\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}F_1, \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}F_2\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}[F_1, F_2] = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\lambda(\\epsilon)F_3 = \\frac{\\lambda(\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon} E_3\n$$\nThe other brackets are $[E_2, E_3] = 0$ and $[E_3, E_1] = 0$. Let $\\mu(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\lambda(\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon}$. The only non-zero structure constants $c_{ij}^k$ for the Lie algebra basis $\\{E_i\\}$ (defined by $[E_i, E_j] = \\sum_k c_{ij}^k E_k$) are $c_{12}^3 = \\mu(\\epsilon)$ and $c_{21}^3 = -\\mu(\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe sectional curvature is $K(E_1, E_2) = g_f(R(E_1, E_2)E_2, E_1)$. The Riemann curvature tensor is given by $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$.\nWe compute the necessary components of the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on $(F, g_f)$ using the formula for a left-invariant metric:\n$g_f(\\nabla_{E_i} E_j, E_k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(g_f([E_i, E_j], E_k) - g_f([E_j, E_k], E_i) + g_f([E_k, E_i], E_j)\\right)$. Since $\\{E_i\\}$ is an orthonormal frame, this simplifies to $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = \\frac{1}{2} (c_{ij}^k - c_{jk}^i + c_{ki}^j)$.\n\nWe need to compute $R(E_1, E_2)E_2$:\n1.  $\\nabla_{E_2}E_2$: $\\Gamma_{22}^k = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{22}^k - c_{2k}^2 + c_{k2}^2) = 0$. So $\\nabla_{E_2}E_2=0$.\n2.  $\\nabla_{E_1}E_2$:\n    $\\Gamma_{12}^1 = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{12}^1 - c_{21}^1 + c_{11}^2)=0$.\n    $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{12}^2 - c_{22}^1 + c_{21}^2)=0$.\n    $\\Gamma_{12}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{12}^3 - c_{23}^1 + c_{31}^2) = \\frac{1}{2}c_{12}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)$.\n    So, $\\nabla_{E_1}E_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)E_3$.\n3.  $[E_1,E_2] = \\mu(\\epsilon)E_3$.\nThe curvature term becomes:\n$R(E_1, E_2)E_2 = 0 - \\nabla_{E_2}(\\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)E_3) - \\nabla_{\\mu(\\epsilon)E_3}E_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)\\nabla_{E_2}E_3 - \\mu(\\epsilon)\\nabla_{E_3}E_2$.\n\n4.  $\\nabla_{E_2}E_3$:\n    $\\Gamma_{23}^1 = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{23}^1 - c_{31}^2 + c_{12}^3) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)$.\n    $\\Gamma_{23}^2 = 0, \\Gamma_{23}^3 = 0$.\n    So, $\\nabla_{E_2}E_3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)E_1$.\n5.  $\\nabla_{E_3}E_2$:\n    $\\Gamma_{32}^1 = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{32}^1 - c_{21}^3 + c_{13}^2) = -\\frac{1}{2}c_{21}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}c_{12}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)$.\n    $\\Gamma_{32}^2 = 0, \\Gamma_{32}^3 = 0$.\n    So, $\\nabla_{E_3}E_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)E_1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R(E_1, E_2)E_2$:\n$R(E_1, E_2)E_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)E_1\\right) - \\mu(\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\epsilon)E_1\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4}(\\mu(\\epsilon))^2 E_1 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu(\\epsilon))^2 E_1 = -\\frac{3}{4}(\\mu(\\epsilon))^2 E_1$.\n\nThe sectional curvature is then:\n$K(E_1, E_2) = g_f(R(E_1, E_2)E_2, E_1) = g_f\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}(\\mu(\\epsilon))^2 E_1, E_1\\right) = -\\frac{3}{4}(\\mu(\\epsilon))^2 g_f(E_1, E_1)$.\nSince $g_f(E_1,E_1)=1$, we have:\n$K(E_1, E_2) = -\\frac{3}{4}(\\mu(\\epsilon))^2 = -\\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda(\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon}\\right)^2$.\n\nFinally, we impose the scaling choice $\\lambda(\\epsilon) = \\epsilon$. This choice ensures that the sectional curvature remains bounded as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the sectional curvature:\n$K(E_1, E_2) = -\\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{3}{4}(1)^2 = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe numerical value of the sectional curvature of the specified vertical plane is $-\\frac{3}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{4}}$$", "id": "2971509"}]}
