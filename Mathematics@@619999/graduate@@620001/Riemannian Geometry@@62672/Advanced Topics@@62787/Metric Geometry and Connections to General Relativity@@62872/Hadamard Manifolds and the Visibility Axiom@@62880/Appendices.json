We are given a point $p \\in M$ and a geodesic segment $[x,y] \\subset M$ of length $\\ell = d(x,y)$. Let $\\gamma$ be the unique geodesic line containing $[x,y]$. The problem states that there is a point $m \\in \\gamma$ which is the foot of the perpendicular from $p$ to $\\gamma$, and that $m$ lies in the interior of the segment $[x,y]$. This geometric configuration defines two geodesic triangles, $\\triangle pmx$ and $\\triangle pmy$, which share the side $[p,m]$ and have a right angle at the vertex $m$.\n\nLet $r = d(p,m)$ be the minimal distance from $p$ to the line $\\gamma$. Let $\\ell_1 = d(m,x)$ and $\\ell_2 = d(m,y)$. Since $m$ is in the interior of the segment $[x,y]$, we have $\\ell_1  0$, $\\ell_2  0$, and $\\ell_1 + \\ell_2 = \\ell$. The angle of interest is $\\theta = \\angle xpy$. This angle is the sum of the angles $\\alpha = \\angle mpx$ and $\\beta = \\angle mpy$. Thus, $\\theta = \\alpha + \\beta$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to use comparison geometry. Since the sectional curvatures of $M$ satisfy $K \\leq -1$, we can compare geodesic triangles in $M$ with corresponding triangles in the model space of constant curvature $-1$, which is the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$. The Toponogov comparison theorem implies that the angles of a geodesic triangle in $M$ are less than or equal to the angles of a comparison triangle in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ with the same side lengths.\n\nLet's apply this to the right-angled triangle $\\triangle pmx$. We construct a comparison triangle $\\triangle \\bar{p}\\bar{m}\\bar{x}$ in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ with side lengths $d(\\bar{p},\\bar{m}) = r$ and $d(\\bar{m},\\bar{x}) = \\ell_1$, and the angle at $\\bar{m}$ being $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Let $\\bar{\\alpha}$ be the angle at $\\bar{p}$ in this hyperbolic triangle. The comparison theorem gives $\\alpha \\leq \\bar{\\alpha}$. Similarly, for $\\triangle pmy$, we construct a comparison triangle $\\triangle \\bar{p}\\bar{m}\\bar{y}$ in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ with sides $d(\\bar{p},\\bar{m}) = r$ and $d(\\bar{m},\\bar{y}) = \\ell_2$ and a right angle at $\\bar{m}$. If $\\bar{\\beta}$ is the angle at $\\bar{p}$, then $\\beta \\leq \\bar{\\beta}$.\nCombining these, we get an upper bound for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\alpha + \\beta \\leq \\bar{\\alpha} + \\bar{\\beta}\n$$\nWe now calculate $\\bar{\\alpha}$ and $\\bar{\\beta}$ using hyperbolic trigonometry. For a right-angled triangle in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ with adjacent leg $b$ and opposite leg $a$ to an angle $A$, the following relation holds:\n$$\n\\tan(A) = \\frac{\\tanh(a)}{\\sinh(b)}\n$$\nFor $\\triangle \\bar{p}\\bar{m}\\bar{x}$, the angle is $\\bar{\\alpha}$, the opposite leg has length $\\ell_1$, and the adjacent leg has length $r$. Thus:\n$$\n\\tan(\\bar{\\alpha}) = \\frac{\\tanh(\\ell_1)}{\\sinh(r)} \\implies \\bar{\\alpha} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\tanh(\\ell_1)}{\\sinh(r)}\\right)\n$$\nSimilarly, for $\\triangle \\bar{p}\\bar{m}\\bar{y}$:\n$$\n\\tan(\\bar{\\beta}) = \\frac{\\tanh(\\ell_2)}{\\sinh(r)} \\implies \\bar{\\beta} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\tanh(\\ell_2)}{\\sinh(r)}\\right)\n$$\nThe upper bound on $\\theta$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\theta \\leq \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\tanh(\\ell_1)}{\\sinh(r)}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\tanh(\\ell_2)}{\\sinh(r)}\\right)\n$$\nThis bound depends on the position of $m$, parameterized by $\\ell_1$ (since $\\ell_2 = \\ell - \\ell_1$). To find an explicit upper bound $f(\\ell,r)$ valid for all such configurations, we must maximize this expression with respect to $\\ell_1 \\in (0, \\ell)$.\nLet $g(\\ell_1) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\tanh(\\ell_1)}{\\sinh(r)}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\tanh(\\ell - \\ell_1)}{\\sinh(r)}\\right)$.\nLet's analyze the function $h(x) = \\arctan\\left(c \\tanh(x)\\right)$ for a constant $c = 1/\\sinh(r)$. The second derivative is\n$$\nh''(x) = \\frac{-2c\\tanh(x)\\text{sech}^2(x)(1+c^2)}{(1+c^2 \\tanh^2(x))^2}\n$$\nFor $x0$, we have $\\tanh(x)0$ and $\\text{sech}^2(x)0$, so $h''(x)  0$. This means $h(x)$ is a strictly concave function for $x0$.\nWe are maximizing the sum $g(\\ell_1) = h(\\ell_1) + h(\\ell - \\ell_1)$. Since $h$ is concave, by Jensen's inequality, the sum is maximized when $\\ell_1 = \\ell - \\ell_1$, which implies $\\ell_1 = \\frac{\\ell}{2}$. This corresponds to the symmetric case where $m$ is the midpoint of the segment $[x,y]$.\nThe maximum value is:\n$$\nf(\\ell,r) = h(\\ell/2) + h(\\ell/2) = 2h(\\ell/2) = 2 \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\tanh(\\ell/2)}{\\sinh(r)}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the explicit upper bound for $\\theta$.\n\nNext, we determine the leading-order asymptotic behavior of this bound as $r \\to \\infty$ with $\\ell$ held fixed. Let $C = \\tanh(\\ell/2)$, which is a constant with respect to $r$. The expression for the bound is $2 \\arctan\\left(\\frac{C}{\\sinh(r)}\\right)$.\nAs $r \\to \\infty$, $\\sinh(r)$ grows exponentially, so the argument of the arctangent function, $z = \\frac{C}{\\sinh(r)}$, approaches $0$. The Taylor series expansion of $\\arctan(z)$ around $z=0$ is $\\arctan(z) = z - \\frac{z^3}{3} + O(z^5)$. The leading term is simply $z$.\nThus, for large $r$, the bound on $\\theta$ behaves as:\n$$\n\\theta \\le f(\\ell,r) \\sim 2 \\cdot \\frac{C}{\\sinh(r)} = \\frac{2\\tanh(\\ell/2)}{\\sinh(r)}\n$$\nTo find the exponential decay rate, we use the asymptotic behavior of the hyperbolic sine function for large $r$:\n$$\n\\sinh(r) = \\frac{e^r - e^{-r}}{2} \\sim \\frac{e^r}{2} \\quad \\text{as } r \\to \\infty\n$$\nSubstituting this into our approximation for $f(\\ell,r)$:\n$$\nf(\\ell,r) \\sim \\frac{2\\tanh(\\ell/2)}{e^r/2} = 4\\tanh(\\ell/2)e^{-r}\n$$\nThis bound is sharp, as it is achieved in the model space $\\mathbb{H}^2$ for the symmetric configuration ($\\ell_1=\\ell_2=\\ell/2$). Therefore, the leading-order asymptotic behavior of $\\theta$ itself, in the sense of the slowest possible decay across all manifolds satisfying the conditions, is given by this expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right) \\exp(-r)}\n$$", "id": "2978387"}, {"introduction": "The 'thinness' of triangles directly leads to the celebrated visibility property of certain Hadamard manifolds.

All subsequent calculations will be performed in this plane.\n\nThe points form an isosceles triangle $\\triangle ox_ty_t$, where the side lengths are $d(o, x_t) = t$ and $d(o, y_t) = t$, and the angle at vertex $o$ is $\\angle x_t o y_t = \\alpha$. The side opposite to $o$ is the geodesic segment $\\sigma_t$.\n\nThe quantity $h(t, \\alpha)$ is the minimum distance from the vertex $o$ to the opposite side $\\sigma_t$. This distance is realized along the altitude from $o$ to the geodesic line containing $\\sigma_t$, provided the foot of the altitude lies on the segment $\\sigma_t$.\n\nLet $L_t$ be the geodesic line containing the segment $\\sigma_t$. Let $m_t$ be the point on $L_t$ such that the geodesic segment $om_t$ is perpendicular to $L_t$. The length of this altitude is $d(o, m_t)$. By the symmetry of the isosceles triangle $\\triangle ox_ty_t$, the geodesic line containing the altitude $om_t$ must bisect the angle $\\alpha$. This creates two congruent right-angled triangles, $\\triangle om_tx_t$ and $\\triangle om_ty_t$.\n\nConsider the right-angled triangle $\\triangle om_tx_t$. The angle at $m_t$ is $\\pi/2$. The angle at $o$ is $\\alpha/2$. The hypotenuse is the side $ox_t$, which has length $c = d(o, x_t) = t$. Let $h = d(o, m_t)$ be the length of the leg adjacent to the angle $\\alpha/2$.\n\nIn a hyperbolic right-angled triangle with hypotenuse $c$ and an acute angle $A$, the adjacent leg $b$ satisfies the relation:\n$$ \\tanh(b) = \\tanh(c) \\cos(A) $$\nApplying this formula to $\\triangle om_tx_t$ with $b=h$, $c=t$, and $A = \\alpha/2$, we get:\n$$ \\tanh(h) = \\tanh(t) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) $$\nThis expression gives the distance from $o$ to the line $L_t$. We must confirm that the point $m_t$ lies on the segment $\\sigma_t$. This is equivalent to the base angles of the isosceles triangle $\\triangle ox_ty_t$ being acute. Let $\\beta = \\angle ox_ty_t$. In the right triangle $\\triangle om_tx_t$, the angle at $x_t$ is $\\beta$. The hyperbolic law of cosines for angles states $\\cosh(c) = \\cot(A)\\cot(B)$. Applying this gives:\n$$ \\cosh(t) = \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\cot(\\beta) $$\nSince $t0$ and $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi)$, we have $\\cosh(t)  1$ and $\\cot(\\alpha/2)  0$. Therefore, $\\cot(\\beta) = \\cosh(t)\\tan(\\alpha/2)  0$. This implies that $\\beta$ must be an acute angle, i.e., $\\beta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$. Since the base angles are acute, the foot of the altitude $m_t$ lies between $x_t$ and $y_t$.\n\nThus, the minimal distance from $o$ to the segment $\\sigma_t$ is indeed given by $h$.\n$$ h(t, \\alpha) = \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left(\\tanh(t) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for a function $R(\\epsilon)$ such that for every $\\alpha \\ge \\epsilon  0$ and every $t0$, the segment $\\sigma_t$ intersects the ball $B(o, R(\\epsilon))$. This is equivalent to finding an upper bound for $h(t, \\alpha)$ valid over the specified domain of $t$ and $\\alpha$. The tightest such bound is the supremum:\n$$ R(\\epsilon) = \\sup_{\\substack{t0 \\\\ \\alpha \\ge \\epsilon}} h(t, \\alpha) $$\nWe analyze the function $h(t, \\alpha)$. The function $\\operatorname{arctanh}(z)$ is strictly increasing for $z \\in (-1, 1)$. We need to find the supremum of its argument, $\\tanh(t) \\cos(\\alpha/2)$, over the domain $t \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $\\alpha \\in [\\epsilon, \\pi)$.\n\n1.

Dependence on $\\alpha$: For a fixed $t$, $\\tanh(t)$ is a positive constant. The function $\\cos(\\alpha/2)$ is strictly decreasing for $\\alpha \\in [\\epsilon, \\pi)$.\n\nTo maximize the product $\\tanh(t) \\cos(\\alpha/2)$, we must take the supremum over $t$ and the supremum over $\\alpha$ for the respective functions.\n$$ \\sup_{t0} \\tanh(t) = 1 $$\n$$ \\sup_{\\alpha \\ge \\epsilon} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{since } \\cos \\text{ is decreasing}) $$\nTherefore, the supremum of the argument is $\\cos(\\epsilon/2)$.

Let their initial tangent vectors be $v = r'(0) \\in T_x X$ and $w = s'(0) \\in T_x X$. Since they are initial vectors of arc-length parametrized rays (or can be reparametrized as such), they are unit vectors: $\\|v\\|_x = \\|w\\|_x = 1$. The Riemannian angle $\\theta_{v,w}$ between these vectors at $x$ is given by $\\theta_{v,w} = \\arccos(\\langle v, w \\rangle_x)$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_x$ is the Riemannian inner product on the tangent space $T_x X$.\n\nThe definition of the Alexandrov angle $\\angle_x(\\xi, \\eta) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}} \\bar{\\angle}_{x}(r(t),s(t))$ is precisely constructed such that it equals this Riemannian angle.

We can reparametrize $\\gamma$ such that $x = \\gamma(0)$.\nThe geodesic ray from $x$ to $\\xi$ is the curve $r(t) = \\gamma(-t)$ for $t \\in [0, \\infty)$. Its initial tangent vector is $v = r'(0) = -\\gamma'(0)$.\nThe geodesic ray from $x$ to $\\eta$ is the curve $s(t) = \\gamma(t)$ for $t \\in [0, \\infty)$. Its initial tangent vector is $w = s'(0) = \\gamma'(0)$.\n\nThe vectors $v$ and $w$ are unit vectors since $\\gamma$ is parametrized by arc length. We can now compute the angle $\\angle_x(\\xi, \\eta)$:\n$$\n\\angle_x(\\xi, \\eta) = \\arccos(\\langle v, w \\rangle_x) = \\arccos(\\langle -\\gamma'(0), \\gamma'(0) \\rangle_x)\n$$\nUsing the properties of the inner product:\n$$\n\\langle -\\gamma'(0), \\gamma'(0) \\rangle_x = - \\langle \\gamma'(0), \\gamma'(0) \\rangle_x = - \\|\\gamma'(0)\\|_x^2 = -1\n$$\nTherefore, for any point $x$ on the geodesic connecting $\\xi$ and $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\angle_x(\\xi, \\eta) = \\arccos(-1) = \\pi\n$$\nSince the range of the arccos function is $[0, \\pi]$, the angle $\\angle_x(\\xi, \\eta)$ can never exceed $\\pi$. We have found points where the angle is exactly $\\pi$. Thus, the supremum over all $x \\in X$ must be $\\pi$.\n$$\n\\angle(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sup_{x \\in X} \\angle_x(\\xi, \\eta) = \\pi\n$$\nThis holds for any pair of distinct points $\\xi, \\eta \\in \\partial_\\infty \\mathbb{H}^n$. If $\\xi = \\eta$, the rays are identical, the angle is $0$ for all $x$, and $\\angle(\\xi, \\xi) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: The Tits Distance**\n\nThe Tits metric $d_T(\\xi, \\eta)$ is the length metric induced by $\\angle(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, defined as the infimum of the lengths of all finite chains (polygonal paths) from $\\xi$ to $\\eta$:\n$$\nd_T(\\xi, \\eta) = \\inf\\left\\{\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\\angle(\\xi_i, \\xi_{i+1}) \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\xi_0 = \\xi, \\xi_m = \\eta \\right\\}\n$$\nThe function $\\angle(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ we have computed is $\\angle(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2) = \\pi$ if $\\zeta_1 \\neq \\zeta_2$, and $\\angle(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2) = 0$ if $\\zeta_1 = \\zeta_2$. This is the discrete metric on $\\partial_\\infty X$, scaled by a factor of $\\pi$.\n\nLet's verify if $\\angle$ is a metric.\n1.  $\\angle(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2) \\ge 0$ with equality iff $\\zeta_1 = \\zeta_2$. (True)\n2.  $\\angle(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2) = \\angle(\\zeta_2, \\zeta_1)$. (True by symmetry of the definition)\n3.  Triangle inequality: $\\angle(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_3) \\le \\angle(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2) + \\angle(\\zeta_2, \\zeta_3)$.\n    If $\\zeta_1 = \\zeta_3$, LHS is $0$, which is $\\le$ RHS.\n    If $\\zeta_1 \\neq \\zeta_3$, LHS is $\\pi$. The RHS is $\\angle(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2) + \\angle(\\zeta_2, \\zeta_3)$. If $\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2, \\zeta_3$ are all distinct, RHS = $\\pi + \\pi = 2\\pi$. If $\\zeta_2$ equals $\\zeta_1$ or $\\zeta_3$, RHS is $\\pi$. In all cases, $\\pi \\le \\text{RHS}$. The triangle inequality holds.\n\nSo, $\\angle$ is itself a metric. The Tits distance $d_T$ is defined as the intrinsic metric associated with the metric $\\angle$. A general property of metric spaces states that if the starting distance function is already a metric, then the induced intrinsic distance is identical to the original metric.\n\nWe can see this directly from the definition.\nConsider the simplest possible chain from $\\xi$ to $\\eta$ (where $\\xi \\neq \\eta$), which is the chain with $m=1$: $(\\xi_0, \\xi_1) = (\\xi, \\eta)$. The length of this chain is $\\sum_{i=0}^{0} \\angle(\\xi_i, \\xi_{i+1}) = \\angle(\\xi, \\eta) = \\pi$.\nThis means that $\\pi$ is one of the values in the set over which the infimum is taken. Thus, $d_T(\\xi, \\eta) \\le \\pi$.\n\nNow consider any other chain with $m  1$: $(\\xi_0, \\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_m)$, where $\\xi_0=\\xi, \\xi_m=\\eta$. The length is $\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \\angle(\\xi_i, \\xi_{i+1})$. Because $\\angle$ is a metric, it satisfies the triangle inequality. By repeated application:\n$$\n\\angle(\\xi, \\eta) = \\angle(\\xi_0, \\xi_m) \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \\angle(\\xi_i, \\xi_{i+1})\n$$\nThis shows that the length of any chain is bounded below by $\\angle(\\xi, \\eta) = \\pi$.\nCombining these two facts, the infimum must be exactly $\\pi$.\n$$\nd_T(\\xi, \\eta) = \\pi\n$$\nThis result is specific to rank-1 symmetric spaces like $\\mathbb{H}^n$. For spaces that are products (like $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^m$), or higher-rank symmetric spaces, the Tits metric is more complex. But for $\\mathbb{H}^n$, the Tits distance between any two distinct points on the boundary is the constant $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi}\n$$", "id": "2978403"}]}
