The coordinate basis vectors are $\\partial_{1} = \\partial_{u}$ and $\\partial_{2} = \\partial_{v}$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the metric components $g_{ij}$.\nThe Riemannian metric is given as\n$$ g = \\exp(2u^{2}v)(du \\otimes du + dv \\otimes dv) $$\nThe components $g_{ij}$ of the metric tensor in the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_{u}, \\partial_{v}\\}$ are defined by $g_{ij} = g(\\partial_{i}, \\partial_{j})$.

Specifically, for a scalar function $f$ and a vector field $Y$ along the curve, the product rule (Leibniz rule) for the covariant derivative $\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}(fY) = (\\frac{df}{dt})Y + f\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}Y$.\nLet $f(t) = \\lambda'(t)$ and $Y(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))$.\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}\\dot{c} = \\nabla_{\\dot{c}} \\left( \\lambda'(t) \\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) \\right) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\lambda'(t)\\right)\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) + \\lambda'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{c}(t)}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}\\dot{c} = \\lambda''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) + \\lambda'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{c}(t)}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))\n$$\nNow we analyze the second term. The covariant derivative is linear in its first argument (the direction of differentiation). We substitute $\\dot{c}(t) = \\lambda'(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))$ into the subscript of $\\nabla$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{c}(t)}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) = \\nabla_{\\lambda'(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) = \\lambda'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))\n$$\nThe expression $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))$ is the covariant acceleration of the original curve $\\gamma$, evaluated at the parameter value $\\lambda(t)$. Since $\\gamma$ is a geodesic parameterized by an affine parameter $\\lambda$, its covariant acceleration is zero everywhere along the curve: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$.\nTherefore, the second term vanishes:\n$$\n\\lambda'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{c}(t)}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) = \\lambda'(t) \\left( \\lambda'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))}\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) \\right) = (\\lambda'(t))^2 \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we find the expression for the covariant acceleration of $c(t)$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}\\dot{c} = \\lambda''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))\n$$\nThis term is the \"additional term\" that arises because the reparameterization is non-affine (i.e., $\\lambda''(t) \\neq 0$).\n\nThe problem asks to show that $\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}\\dot{c}=\\kappa(t)\\,\\dot{c}(t)$ for some scalar function $\\kappa(t)$. We have the relations:\n1. $\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}\\dot{c} = \\lambda''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))$\n2. $\\dot{c}(t) = \\lambda'(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))$\n\nFrom the second relation, since $\\lambda'(t) = 3t^2+1 \\neq 0$, we can express $\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t))$ in terms of $\\dot{c}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(\\lambda(t)) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda'(t)}\\dot{c}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the first relation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}\\dot{c} = \\lambda''(t) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda'(t)}\\dot{c}(t) \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda''(t)}{\\lambda'(t)}\\dot{c}(t)\n$$\nThis is of the form $\\nabla_{\\dot{c}}\\dot{c} = \\kappa(t)\\dot{c}(t)$, with the scalar function $\\kappa(t)$ identified as:\n$$\n\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\lambda''(t)}{\\lambda'(t)}\n$$\nFinally, we compute this function explicitly for the given reparameterization $\\lambda(t) = t^3+t$.\nFirst derivative:\n$$\n\\lambda'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3+t) = 3t^2+1\n$$\nSecond derivative:\n$$\n\\lambda''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2+1) = 6t\n$$\nTherefore, the scalar function $\\kappa(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\kappa(t) = \\frac{6t}{3t^2+1}\n$$\nThis result shows that the covariant acceleration of the reparameterized curve is non-zero (for $t \\neq 0$) and is always directed along the curve's tangent vector.
