The option provides a correct explanation for why $g$ fails to be a Riemannian metric.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the standard and fundamental definition of a Riemannian metric in differential geometry. All concepts used are standard and well-defined.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated. It asks for the evaluation of several proposed constructions against a precise set of criteria derived from the definition of a Riemannian metric. The question is unambiguous and admits a verifiable answer.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased using precise mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n-   **Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. It is a standard exercise in verifying the axioms of a mathematical structure.\n-   **Action:** Proceed to the solution phase by analyzing each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA $(0,2)$-tensor field $g$ on $M=\\mathbb{R}^n$ of the form $g_{p}(u,v) = f(p) \\, \\langle u, v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ for a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must satisfy several conditions to be a Riemannian metric:\n1.  **Bilinearity and Symmetry:** For any fixed $p$, $g_p$ must be a symmetric bilinear form. The Euclidean inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ is a symmetric bilinear form. Multiplying it by a scalar $f(p)$ preserves these properties. So, for options A, B, and C, $g_p$ is a symmetric bilinear form for each $p$.\n2.  **Smoothness:** The tensor field $p \\mapsto g_p$ must be smooth. Since the standard Euclidean metric is smooth (its components in standard coordinates are constant), this is equivalent to the scalar function $f(p)$ being a smooth ($C^{\\infty}$) function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n3.  **Positive-Definiteness:** For every $p \\in M$, $g_p$ must be positive-definite. This means $g_p(v,v) > 0$ for all nonzero $v \\in T_pM$. For the given form, $g_p(v,v) = f(p) \\langle v, v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eucl}} = f(p) \\|v\\|_{\\mathrm{eucl}}^2$. Since $\\|v\\|_{\\mathrm{eucl}}^2 > 0$ for $v \\neq 0$, this condition is equivalent to $f(p) > 0$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**A. Define $g_{p}(u,v) = \\|p\\| \\, \\langle u, v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$, where $\\|p\\| = \\sqrt{p_{1}^{2} + \\cdots + p_{n}^{2}}$.**\n-   This corresponds to $f(p) = \\|p\\|$.\n-   **Smoothness:** The function $f(p) = \\|p\\|$ is not smooth on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. It is not differentiable at $p=0$. For example, in the case $n=1$, $f(p) = |p|$, which is not differentiable at $p=0$. For $n>1$, the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\|p\\| = \\frac{p_i}{\\|p\\|}$ is undefined at $p=0$. Since a Riemannian metric must be a smooth tensor field, this construction fails on the smoothness criterion.\n-   **Conclusion:** The statement in option A that \"$g$ is smooth\" is false. Therefore, the option provides an incorrect construction. The reason it fails to be a Riemannian metric is not *solely* the lack of positive-definiteness at $p=0$; it also fails the smoothness condition at $p=0$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Define $g_{p}(u,v) = \\sin(\\|p\\|) \\, \\langle u, v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$.**\n-   This corresponds to $f(p) = \\sin(\\|p\\|)$.\n-   **Smoothness:** The function $f(p)$ is a composition of the sine function (which is smooth) and the norm function $\\|p\\|$. As established in the analysis of option A, $\\|p\\|$ is not smooth at $p=0$. The composition of a smooth function with a non-smooth function is generally not smooth. Let's check for $n=1$: $f(p) = \\sin(|p|)$. The derivative for $p \\neq 0$ is $f'(p) = \\cos(|p|) \\cdot \\text{sgn}(p)$. As $p \\to 0^+$, $f'(p) \\to 1$. As $p \\to 0^-$, $f'(p) \\to -1$. Since the limits of the derivative do not match, the function is not differentiable at $p=0$. Thus, $g$ is not a smooth tensor field on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n-   **Conclusion:** The statement in option B that \"$g$ is smooth\" is false. This option is incorrect for the same primary reason as option A. Additionally, the condition for positive-definiteness is $\\sin(\\|p\\|) > 0$. At points where $\\sin(\\|p\\|) < 0$, the form $g_p$ is negative-definite, which is also a failure. The given explanation is incomplete.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Define $\\varphi \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $\\varphi(p) = e^{-1/\\|p\\|^{2}}$ for $p \\neq 0$ and $\\varphi(0) = 0$, and set $g_{p}(u,v) = \\varphi(p) \\, \\langle u, v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$.**\n-   This corresponds to $f(p) = \\varphi(p)$.\n-   **Smoothness:** The function $\\varphi(p)$ is a standard example of a smooth function that is not analytic at the origin. For $p \\neq 0$, $\\varphi(p)$ is a composition of smooth functions ($p \\mapsto \\|p\\|^2$, $t \\mapsto -1/t$, $s \\mapsto e^s$), so it is smooth. At $p=0$, one can show that all partial derivatives of any order exist and are equal to $0$. This involves showing that for any multi-index $\\alpha$, $\\lim_{p \\to 0} D^{\\alpha}\\varphi(p) = 0$. The derivatives for $p \\neq 0$ are of the form $P(p) \\|p\\|^{-k} e^{-1/\\|p\\|^2}$ for some polynomial $P$ and integer $k$. The exponential term $e^{-1/\\|p\\|^2}$ goes to $0$ faster than any polynomial in $\\|p\\|^{-1}$ grows as $p \\to 0$. Thus, all derivatives approach $0$ at the origin, proving that $\\varphi(p)$ is a smooth ($C^{\\infty}$) function on all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Consequently, $g$ is a smooth, symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor field.\n-   **Positive-Definiteness:** For $g_p$ to be positive-definite, we need $\\varphi(p) > 0$.\n    -   For any $p \\neq 0$, $\\|p\\|^2 > 0$, so $e^{-1/\\|p\\|^2} > 0$. Thus, $g_p$ is positive-definite on the set $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This set is a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n    -   At $p=0$, $\\varphi(0) = 0$ by definition. This means $g_{0}(u,v) = 0 \\cdot \\langle u,v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eucl}} = 0$ for all $u,v$. For any nonzero vector $v \\in T_0 \\mathbb{R}^n$, we have $g_0(v,v)=0$, which violates the positive-definiteness condition $g_0(v,v)>0$. So, $g$ is not positive-definite everywhere.\n-   **Explanation:** The option correctly identifies that $g$ is smooth and symmetric, is positive-definite on the dense set $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$, and fails to be a Riemannian metric because it is not positive-definite at the single point $p=0$. This explanation is accurate and complete.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. Define $g_{p}(u,v) = \\|u\\| \\, \\|v\\|$ for $u,v \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.**\n-   **Bilinearity:** This proposed object $g_p$ is not a bilinear form, and therefore not a $(0,2)$-tensor. Let's check linearity in the first argument. For $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $u, v \\in T_p \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n    $g_p(\\alpha u, v) = \\|\\alpha u\\| \\|v\\| = |\\alpha| \\|u\\| \\|v\\|$.\n    For this to equal $\\alpha g_p(u, v) = \\alpha \\|u\\| \\|v\\|$, we would need $|\\alpha| = \\alpha$, which is only true for $\\alpha \\ge 0$. Since this does not hold for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $g_p$ is not linear in the first argument. It is not a bilinear form.\n-   **Conclusion:** The fundamental premise that $g$ is a $(0,2)$-tensor field is false. Any subsequent discussion of positive-definiteness or why it fails to be a Riemannian metric is moot. The term \"positive-definite\" is defined for symmetric bilinear forms, a category to which $g_p$ does not belong.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option C correctly constructs a tensor field with the specified properties and provides a correct explanation for its failure to be a Riemannian metric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2973806"}, {"introduction": "With the definition of a Riemannian metric established, we turn to its primary application: measuring distance.

Then its transpose is:\n$$\nA^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} A^{1}_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ A^{1}_{2} & A^{2}_{2} & 0 \\\\ A^{1}_{3} & A^{2}_{3} & A^{3}_{3} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe product $A^{T}A$ yields the matrix of metric components:\n$$\nG = A^{T}A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n(A^{1}_{1})^{2} & A^{1}_{1}A^{1}_{2} & A^{1}_{1}A^{1}_{3} \\\\\nA^{1}_{1}A^{1}_{2} & (A^{1}_{2})^{2}+(A^{2}_{2})^{2} & A^{1}_{2}A^{1}_{3}+A^{2}_{2}A^{2}_{3} \\\\\nA^{1}_{1}A^{1}_{3} & A^{1}_{2}A^{1}_{3}+A^{2}_{2}A^{2}_{3} & (A^{1}_{3})^{2}+(A^{2}_{3})^{2}+(A^{3}_{3})^{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe given metric matrix is:\n$$\nG = [g_{ij}] =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1+x^{2})^{2} & y(1+x^{2}) & z(1+x^{2}) \\\\\ny(1+x^{2}) & y^{2}+(1+y^{2})^{2} & yz(2+y^{2}) \\\\\nz(1+x^{2}) & yz(2+y^{2}) & z^{2}+y^{2}z^{2}+(1+z^{2})^{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe now solve for the entries of $A$ by equating the components of $G$ with the expression for $A^{T}A$.\n\nFrom the $(1,1)$ component:\n$g_{11} = (A^{1}_{1})^{2} = (1+x^{2})^{2}$. Since $A^{1}_{1}>0$, we have $A^{1}_{1} = 1+x^{2}$.\n\nFrom the $(1,2)$ component:\n$g_{12} = A^{1}_{1}A^{1}_{2} = y(1+x^{2})$. Substituting $A^{1}_{1}$, we get $(1+x^{2})A^{1}_{2} = y(1+x^{2})$, which implies $A^{1}_{2} = y$.\n\nFrom the $(1,3)$ component:\n$g_{13} = A^{1}_{1}A^{1}_{3} = z(1+x^{2})$. Substituting $A^{1}_{1}$, we get $(1+x^{2})A^{1}_{3} = z(1+x^{2})$, which implies $A^{1}_{3} = z$.\n\nFrom the $(2,2)$ component:\n$g_{22} = (A^{1}_{2})^{2}+(A^{2}_{2})^{2} = y^{2}+(1+y^{2})^{2}$. Substituting $A^{1}_{2}=y$, we have $y^{2}+(A^{2}_{2})^{2} = y^{2}+(1+y^{2})^{2}$. This simplifies to $(A^{2}_{2})^{2}=(1+y^{2})^{2}$. Since $A^{2}_{2}>0$, we have $A^{2}_{2} = 1+y^{2}$.\n\nFrom the $(2,3)$ component:\n$g_{23} = A^{1}_{2}A^{1}_{3}+A^{2}_{2}A^{2}_{3} = yz(2+y^{2})$. Substituting the known values for $A^{1}_{2}, A^{1}_{3}, A^{2}_{2}$:\n$y \\cdot z + (1+y^{2})A^{2}_{3} = yz(2+y^{2})$. Expanding the right-hand side gives $yz + (1+y^{2})A^{2}_{3} = 2yz + y^3z$. Subtracting $yz$ from both sides gives $(1+y^{2})A^{2}_{3} = yz + y^3z = yz(1+y^2)$. This implies $A^{2}_{3} = yz$.\n\nFrom the $(3,3)$ component:\n$g_{33} = (A^{1}_{3})^{2}+(A^{2}_{3})^{2}+(A^{3}_{3})^{2} = z^{2}+y^{2}z^{2}+(1+z^{2})^{2}$. Substituting the known values for $A^{1}_{3}, A^{2}_{3}$:\n$z^{2} + (yz)^{2} + (A^{3}_{3})^{2} = z^{2}+y^{2}z^{2}+(1+z^{2})^{2}$.\nThis simplifies to $(A^{3}_{3})^{2} = (1+z^{2})^{2}$. Since $A^{3}_{3}>0$, we have $A^{3}_{3} = 1+z^{2}$.\n\nThus, we have determined all the components of the matrix $A$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+x^{2} & y & z \\\\ 0 & 1+y^{2} & yz \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1+z^{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rows of this matrix $A$ define the components of the orthonormal coframe $\\{\\theta^{1}, \\theta^{2}, \\theta^{3}\\}$ with respect to the basis $\\{dx, dy, dz\\}$.\n\nThe first $1$-form, $\\theta^{1}$, has components given by the first row of $A$:\n$$\n\\theta^{1} = A^{1}_{1} dx + A^{1}_{2} dy + A^{1}_{3} dz = (1+x^{2})dx + y\\,dy + z\\,dz\n$$\nThe second $1$-form, $\\theta^{2}$, has components given by the second row of $A$:\n$$\n\\theta^{2} = A^{2}_{1} dx + A^{2}_{2} dy + A^{2}_{3} dz = 0 \\cdot dx + (1+y^{2})dy + yz\\,dz = (1+y^{2})dy + yz\\,dz\n$$\nThe third $1$-form, $\\theta^{3}$, has components given by the third row of $A$:\n$$\n\\theta^{3} = A^{3}_{1} dx + A^{3}_{2} dy + A^{3}_{3} dz = 0 \\cdot dx + 0 \\cdot dy + (1+z^{2})dz = (1+z^{2})dz\n$$\nThis set $\\{\\theta^{1}, \\theta^{2}, \\theta^{3}\\}$ is the required orthonormal coframe.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} (1+x^{2})dx + y\\,dy + z\\,dz & (1+y^{2})dy + yz\\,dz & (1+z^{2})dz \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2973830"}]}
