To show that $M$ is not complete, we must demonstrate that this non-convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence with respect to the Riemannian distance $d_g$.\n\nLet $p_n = (\\frac{1}{n}, 0)$ and $p_m = (\\frac{1}{m}, 0)$ for integers $m  n \\ge 1$. The straight line segment connecting these two points is given by the set of points $\\{(x, 0) \\mid x \\in [\\frac{1}{m}, \\frac{1}{n}]\\}$. Since $n \\ge 1$, we have $x  0$ for all points on this segment, so the segment lies entirely in $M$. As the metric $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric, the shortest path between any two points, if it lies in $M$, is the straight line segment. Therefore, the Riemannian distance $d_g(p_n, p_m)$ is simply the Euclidean distance between them:\n$$d_g(p_n, p_m) = \\|p_n - p_m\\|_{g} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\left|\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m}\\right|$$\nTo show that $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, we must show that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n  N$, we have $d_g(p_n, p_m)  \\epsilon$.\nThe sequence $\\{\\frac{1}{n}\\}$ is a convergent (and thus Cauchy) sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$.

Since this sequence does not converge in $M$, we have explicitly demonstrated that $(M, g)$ is not a metric complete space.\n\nNext, we determine the Riemannian distance $d_g(p,q)$ between the points $p=(1,0)$ and $q=(-1,0)$.\nThe distance $d_g(p,q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all curves in $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$. The metric $g$ induces the standard Euclidean notion of length. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the length of any curve from $p$ to $q$ is bounded below by the straight-line Euclidean distance, $\\|p-q\\|_{\\mathbb{R}^2}$.\n$$\\|p-q\\|_{\\mathbb{R}^2} = \\|(1,0) - (-1,0)\\|_{\\mathbb{R}^2} = \\|(2,0)\\|_{\\mathbb{R}^2} = 2$$\nTherefore, for any curve $\\gamma$ in $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$, its length $L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$. This implies that the infimum of these lengths must also satisfy $d_g(p,q) \\ge 2$.\n\nTo show that the infimum is exactly $2$, we must construct a sequence of curves $\\{\\gamma_k\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ in $M$ such that their lengths $L(\\gamma_k)$ approach $2$.

In Euclidean space, it is a fundamental geometric fact that the unique path of shortest length between two points is the straight line segment connecting them. Any other path is strictly longer.\nThe straight line segment from $p=(1,0)$ to $q=(-1,0)$ can be parameterized as $\\gamma_{straight}(t) = (1-t)p + tq = (1-2t, 0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. The length of this path is indeed $2$. However, for this to be a valid path in $M$, every point on it must belong to $M$. At the parameter value $t = \\frac{1}{2}$, the path passes through the point $\\gamma_{straight}(\\frac{1}{2}) = (0,0)$.\nSince $(0,0) \\notin M$, the unique length-minimizing path in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a valid path in the manifold $M$. Any curve in $M$ that connects $p$ and $q$ must deviate from this straight line to avoid the origin, and any such deviation results in a path of length strictly greater than $2$. Consequently, no curve *in $M$* has a length of $2$.\nThis shows that the infimum defining the distance $d_g(p,q)$ is not a minimum; it is not attained.

A key consequence of this theorem is that a Riemannian manifold is complete if and only if the distance from any fixed point to any \"point at infinity\" is infinite. If there exists a curve of finite length that leaves every compact subset of the manifold, then the manifold is metrically incomplete. Conversely, for a manifold such as the one given, which is a simply connected and homogeneous space, completeness is guaranteed if the distance from a single point (e.g., the origin) to infinity is infinite.\n\nWe will investigate the length of a path that \"goes to infinity.\" Due to the rotational symmetry of the metric $g_p$, a natural choice for such a path is a radial ray starting from the origin.
