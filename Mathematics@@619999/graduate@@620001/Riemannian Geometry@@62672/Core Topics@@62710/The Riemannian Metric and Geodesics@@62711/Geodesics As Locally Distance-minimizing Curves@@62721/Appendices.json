The metric $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric, $g = dx^2 + dy^2$. The two points are $p = (-1,0)$ and $q = (1,0)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$. By definition, the Riemannian distance is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves in $M$ that connect $p$ and $q$.\nLet $\\mathcal{C}(p,q)$ be the set of all piecewise smooth curves $\\gamma: [a,b] \\to M$ such that $\\gamma(a)=p$ and $\\gamma(b)=q$. The length of such a curve $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ is given by the standard arc length formula in Euclidean space:\n$$L(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t))} \\, dt = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2} \\, dt$$\nThe Riemannian distance is then:\n$$d(p,q) = \\inf \\{L(\\gamma) \\mid \\gamma \\in \\mathcal{C}(p,q)\\}$$\n\nThe manifold $M$ is a subset of the complete manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the same metric. Any curve in $M$ is also a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The shortest distance between $p$ and $q$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the length of the straight line segment connecting them. The Euclidean distance is:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(p,q) = \\sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2} = 2$$\nSince any curve in $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$ is also a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, its length must be at least the Euclidean distance between $p$ and $q$. Thus, for any $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{C}(p,q)$, we have $L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$. Taking the infimum over all such curves, we get:\n$$d(p,q) \\ge 2$$\n\nThe straight line segment connecting $p$ and $q$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by the path $\\gamma_0(t) = (-1+2t, 0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. This path contains the point $(0,0)$ at $t=1/2$. Since $(0,0) \\notin M$, this straight line segment is not a valid curve in $M$.\n\nTo show that the infimum of lengths is indeed $2$, we must construct a sequence of curves in $M$ whose lengths approach $2$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, consider the piecewise smooth curve $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ that consists of two straight line segments: one from $p=(-1,0)$ to the point $r_\\epsilon = (0, \\epsilon)$, and the second from $r_\\epsilon = (0, \\epsilon)$ to $q=(1,0)$. For any $\\epsilon \\neq 0$, the point $r_\\epsilon$ is not the origin, so the entire path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ lies within $M$.\n\nThe length of the first segment (from $p$ to $r_\\epsilon$) is:\n$$L_1 = \\sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (\\epsilon - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\epsilon^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon^2}$$\nThe length of the second segment (from $r_\\epsilon$ to $q$) is:\n$$L_2 = \\sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (0 - \\epsilon)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-\\epsilon)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon^2}$$\nThe total length of the curve $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ is:\n$$L(\\gamma_\\epsilon) = L_1 + L_2 = 2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}$$\nWe can make the length of this path arbitrarily close to $2$ by choosing $\\epsilon$ to be arbitrarily close to $0$. Let's take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n$$\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} L(\\gamma_\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} 2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2} = 2\\sqrt{1+0} = 2$$\nSince we have found a sequence of curves in $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$ whose lengths approach $2$, and we know $d(p,q) \\ge 2$, it must be that the infimum is exactly $2$.\n$$d(p,q) = 2$$\nThis also demonstrates that $M$ is an incomplete manifold, as the infimum of path lengths is not attained by any curve in the sequence (each $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ has length $>2$). The limit of this sequence of curves is the straight line through the origin, which is not in $M$.\n\nNext, we must justify that no geodesic in $M$ minimizes the distance between $p$ and $q$.\nA curve $\\gamma(t)=(x^1(t), x^2(t))$ is a geodesic if it satisfies the geodesic equation:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^2 \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0$$\nwhere $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the metric $g$. Since $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric, its components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant, and all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$. The geodesic equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0$$\nIntegrating this equation twice yields $\\gamma(t) = at+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means the geodesics of $(M,g)$ are the straight lines in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, restricted to open intervals on which they do not pass through the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nA minimizing geodesic connecting $p$ and $q$ would be a curve $\\gamma_{min}$ in $M$ such that:\n1. $\\gamma_{min}$ is a geodesic.\n2. The length of $\\gamma_{min}$ is equal to the distance $d(p,q)$.\n\nFrom our calculation, we know that if such a curve exists, its length must be $L(\\gamma_{min}) = d(p,q) = 2$.\nAs a geodesic, $\\gamma_{min}$ must be a segment of a straight line connecting $p$ and $q$. There is only one such straight line segment in $\\mathbb{R}^2$; it is the portion of the x-axis for $x \\in [-1,1]$. The length of this segment is indeed $2$. However, as established earlier, this segment contains the point $(0,0)$, which is excluded from the manifold $M$.\n\nTherefore, the unique path in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that could potentially be a minimizing geodesic of length $2$ is not a curve in $M$. Any other path in $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$ is not a straight line and thus has a length strictly greater than $2$. For instance, any smooth curve deviating from the straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ will have a greater length.\n\nIn conclusion, no geodesic in $M$ connects the points $p$ and $q$. Consequently, it is impossible for a *minimizing* geodesic to connect them. The distance $d(p,q)=2$ is a finite infimum that is not attained by the length of any curve in $M$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2977164"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that a shortest path may not always exist, we now turn to complete manifolds where they do.

We establish two complementary statements:\n\n(1) Minimization up to $\\pi$. The Gauss Lemma states that, in normal coordinates via the exponential map $\\exp_{N}$, radial geodesics from $N$ are orthogonal to spheres centered at $N$, and the Riemannian metric splits so that the radial parameter equals arc length along geodesics. On the unit sphere, the exponential map at $N$ is given explicitly by $\\exp_{N}(t\\,w)=\\gamma_{w}(t)$ for $w\\in T_{N}S^{2}$ with $\\|w\\|=1$. The differential $d(\\exp_{N})_{t\\,w}$ is invertible for $t\\in(0,\\pi)$, as can be seen via the Jacobi field analysis below and rotational symmetry. Consequently, for $t\\in(0,\\pi)$, the geodesic segment $\\gamma_{w}|_{[0,t]}$ is the unique globally minimizing curve from $N$ to $\\gamma_{w}(t)$, with length equal to $t=d(N,\\gamma_{w}(t))$.\n\nA rigorous local criterion is provided by the theory of Jacobi fields. Along any unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma$, orthogonal variations satisfy the Jacobi field ordinary differential equation (ODE)\n$$\nJ''(t)+R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t)=0,\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. On the unit sphere, the sectional curvature is constant and equals $K=1$, so for a Jacobi field orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ we have the scalar ODE\n$$\nJ''(t)+J(t)=0.\n$$\nWith boundary conditions $J(0)=0$ and $J'(0)\\neq 0$, the solution is $J(t)=\\sin(t)\\,V$ for some fixed $V\\perp\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$. The first nontrivial zero occurs at $t=\\pi$. Thus, the first conjugate point to $N$ along any geodesic is at parameter $t=\\pi$, and there are no conjugate points in $(0,\\pi)$. The standard minimizing theorem in Riemannian geometry then implies that $\\gamma_{w}|_{[0,t]}$ is minimizing for $t\\in(0,\\pi]$.\n\n(2) Failure of minimization beyond $\\pi$. For $t>\\pi$, along the same great circle containing the image of $\\gamma_{w}$, the point $\\gamma_{w}(t)$ can also be reached by traversing the complementary arc of the great circle from $N$ to $\\gamma_{w}(t)$ of length $2\\pi-t$, which satisfies $2\\pi-t<t$ when $t>\\pi$. Therefore, $\\gamma_{w}|_{[0,t]}$ is not globally minimizing for any $t>\\pi$. Furthermore, the presence of a conjugate point at $t=\\pi$ implies that for $t>\\pi$ one can find variations through nearby geodesics (or through curves lying in the same great circle) that strictly reduce length, so the geodesic ceases to minimize past $t=\\pi$.\n\nSupremum $L$ of minimizing lengths. By the above, every unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma_{w}$ starting at $N$ is globally minimizing on $[0,t]$ for all $t\\in[0,\\pi]$, and it ceases to be minimizing for any $t>\\pi$.

The torus is equipped with the metric induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ via the canonical projection $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to T^{n}$.\n\nFirst, we prove that the projection of a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a geodesic in $T^{n}$.\nLet $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = \\tilde{p} + t\\tilde{v}$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, parameterized by arc length (assuming $\\|\\tilde{v}\\|=1$, which we can do without loss of generality). In the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, straight lines are the geodesics. This means their covariant acceleration is zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}}\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}} = 0$.\nLet $\\gamma(t) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$ be the projection of this line onto the torus $T^{n}$. The map $\\pi$ is a Riemannian covering map, which by definition is a local isometry. This means for any point $\\tilde{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, there exists a neighborhood $\\tilde{U}$ of $\\tilde{q}$ such that the restriction $\\pi|_{\\tilde{U}}: \\tilde{U} \\to \\pi(\\tilde{U})$ is an isometry.\nSince an isometry preserves the Riemannian metric and thus the Levi-Civita connection, it maps geodesics to geodesics. For any $t_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can find a small interval $I$ around $t_{0}$ such that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(I)$ is contained in a neighborhood $\\tilde{U}$ where $\\pi$ is an isometry. The curve segment $\\tilde{\\gamma}|_I$ is a geodesic in $\\tilde{U}$, so its image $\\gamma|_I = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}|_I)$ is a geodesic in the neighborhood $\\pi(\\tilde{U}) \\subset T^{n}$.\nA curve $\\gamma$ is a geodesic if it is locally a geodesic. Since this holds for any $t_{0}$, the entire curve $\\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic in $T^{n}$.\n\nSecond, we prove that every geodesic in $T^{n}$ is the projection of a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nLet $\\gamma: I \\to T^{n}$ be a geodesic on the torus, where $I$ is an interval. Let $t_0 \\in I$, and set $x = \\gamma(t_0)$. Choose a point $\\tilde{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in the fiber over $x$, i.e., $\\pi(\\tilde{x}) = x$.\nBy the path-lifting property for covering spaces, there exists a unique lift of the curve $\\gamma$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, starting at $\\tilde{x}$. Let this lift be $\\tilde{\\gamma}: I \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, so that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t_0) = \\tilde{x}$ and $\\pi \\circ \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$.\nBecause $\\pi$ is a local isometry, the lifted curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ must be a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. To see this, consider any point $\\tilde{q} = \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ on the lifted path. There is a neighborhood $\\tilde{U}$ of $\\tilde{q}$ on which $\\pi$ is an isometry onto its image $U = \\pi(\\tilde{U})$. Since $\\gamma$ is a geodesic in $T^{n}$, its segment within $U$ is a geodesic curve. Because $(\\pi|_{\\tilde{U}})^{-1}: U \\to \\tilde{U}$ is also an isometry, it maps the geodesic segment of $\\gamma$ to a geodesic segment of $\\tilde{\\gamma}$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is locally a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that is locally a geodesic is a global geodesic.\nGeodesics in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the standard Euclidean metric are straight lines. Therefore, the lifted curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ must be a segment of a straight line.

The Riemannian distance $d_{T^{n}}(x,y)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting $x$ and $y$.\nLet $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to T^{n}$ be any piecewise smooth curve with $\\gamma(0)=x$ and $\\gamma(1)=y$. Let $\\tilde{x}$ be any chosen lift of $x$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, i.e., $\\pi(\\tilde{x})=x$. By the path-lifting property, there is a unique lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)=\\tilde{x}$ and $\\pi \\circ \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$. The endpoint of the lift, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)$, must be a lift of $y$, so $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1) \\in \\pi^{-1}(y)$.\nThe set of all lifts of $y$ can be described relative to a single lift $\\tilde{y}$. If $\\tilde{y}$ is one such lift, then the entire fiber is $\\pi^{-1}(y) = \\{\\tilde{y} + k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\\}$, since the group of deck transformations is $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ acting by translation.\nSince $\\pi$ is a local isometry, the length of $\\gamma$ is equal to the length of its lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}$: $L_{T^{n}}(\\gamma) = L_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(\\tilde{\\gamma})$.\nTherefore, to find the distance between $x$ and $y$ on the torus, we can find the infimum of lengths of curves in the covering space:\n$$d_{T^{n}}(x,y) = \\inf_{\\gamma \\text{ from } x \\text{ to } y} L(\\gamma) = \\inf_{\\tilde{\\gamma} \\text{ from } \\tilde{x} \\text{ to } \\pi^{-1}(y)} L(\\tilde{\\gamma})$$\nIn Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the shortest path between two points is a straight line, and its length is the Euclidean distance between the points. Thus, the infimum of lengths of curves from $\\tilde{x}$ to a specific lift $\\tilde{y} + k$ is simply the Euclidean distance $\\|\\tilde{x} - (\\tilde{y} + k)\\|$.\nTo find the overall infimum, we must consider all possible endpoints in the fiber of $y$:\n$$d_{T^{n}}(x,y) = \\inf_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\|\\tilde{x} - (\\tilde{y} + k)\\|$$\nSince the set $\\{\\|\\tilde{x} - (\\tilde{y} + k)\\| \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}\\}$ consists of non-negative real numbers and the norm grows to infinity as $\\|k\\| \\to \\infty$, a minimum value must be achieved. Thus, we can replace the infimum with a minimum:\n$$d_{T^{n}}(x,y) = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\|\\tilde{x} - (\\tilde{y} + k)\\|_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the Riemannian distance on $T^{n}$.\n\nA minimizing geodesic between $x$ and $y$ corresponds to the projection of a straight line segment in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that connects a lift $\\tilde{x}$ of $x$ to a lift $\\tilde{y}'$ of $y$, where $\\|\\tilde{x} - \\tilde{y}'\\|$ realizes the minimum distance. Let's fix a lift $\\tilde{x}$ of $x$ and a lift $\\tilde{y}$ of $y$. A minimizing geodesic corresponds to a straight line from $\\tilde{x}$ to $\\tilde{y}+k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ that minimizes the distance.\n\nMultiple distinct minimizing geodesics exist between $x$ and $y$ if and only if there are multiple vectors $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ that achieve this minimum distance.\nLet $k_A, k_B \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ be two distinct integer vectors ($k_A \\neq k_B$) such that\n$$\\|\\tilde{x} - (\\tilde{y} + k_A)\\| = \\|\\tilde{x} - (\\tilde{y} + k_B)\\| = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}} \\|\\tilde{x} - (\\tilde{y} + k)\\|$$\nThe straight line from $\\tilde{x}$ to $\\tilde{y}+k_A$ gives a geodesic $\\gamma_A$, and the line from $\\tilde{x}$ to $\\tilde{y}+k_B$ gives a geodesic $\\gamma_B$. These geodesics are distinct because their initial velocity vectors at $x$ are different. The velocity vectors of the lifts are $\\tilde{v}_A = (\\tilde{y}+k_A) - \\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{v}_B = (\\tilde{y}+k_B) - \\tilde{x}$. Since $k_A \\neq k_B$, we have $\\tilde{v}_A \\neq \\tilde{v}_B$, and since $\\pi_*$ is a local isomorphism, the projected velocity vectors $\\dot{\\gamma}_A(0)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_B(0)$ are also distinct.\n\nThe criterion is as follows: let $\\Delta = \\tilde{x} - \\tilde{y}$ for some lifts $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$. We are looking for the minimum of $\\|\\Delta - k\\|$ over $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Let $\\Delta = (\\Delta_1, ..., \\Delta_n)$. The problem decouples for each coordinate: we want to find $k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ that minimizes $|\\Delta_i - k_i|$.\nFor any real number $z$, the integer $k$ closest to $z$ is unique unless $z$ is a half-integer (i.e., $z = m + \\frac{1}{2}$ for some integer $m$). If $z = m + \\frac{1}{2}$, then both $m$ and $m+1$ are equally close.\nTherefore, multiple minimizing geodesics exist between $x=\\pi(\\tilde{x})$ and $y=\\pi(\\tilde{y})$ if and only if at least one coordinate of the vector difference $\\tilde{x} - \\tilde{y}$ is a half-integer, after being shifted into the fundamental domain $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]^n$ (or any other interval of length 1). More formally, multiple minimizers exist if and only if there is an index $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $\\tilde{x}_i - \\tilde{y}_i \\in \\mathbb{Z} + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n### Part 3: Application to a Specific Case\n\nWe are given $n=5$ and endpoints:\n$x=\\pi(\\tilde{x})$ with $\\tilde{x}=(0, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, 0, \\frac{1}{4})$\n$y=\\pi(\\tilde{y})$ with $\\tilde{y}=(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{7}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0, \\frac{3}{4})$\n\nWe compute the vector difference $\\Delta = \\tilde{x} - \\tilde{y}$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\left(0 - \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{4}{7}, \\quad 0 - \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad 0 - 0, \\quad \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad -\\frac{3}{7}, \\quad -\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad 0, \\quad -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) $$\n\nWe need to find the integer vector $k=(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^5$ that minimizes the squared distance $L^2 = \\|\\Delta - k\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^5 (\\Delta_i - k_i)^2$. This is done by minimizing each term $(\\Delta_i - k_i)^2$ independently.\n\n- For $\\Delta_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$: This is a half-integer. The integers $k_1$ closest to $\\Delta_1$ are $k_1=0$ and $k_1=-1$. Both give a minimum squared distance of $(-\\frac{1}{2} - 0)^2 = (-\\frac{1}{2} - (-1))^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$. There are $2$ choices for $k_1$.\n\n- For $\\Delta_2 = -\\frac{3}{7} \\approx -0.428$: The unique closest integer is $k_2=0$. The minimum squared distance is $(-\\frac{3}{7} - 0)^2 = \\frac{9}{49}$. There is $1$ choice for $k_2$.\n\n- For $\\Delta_3 = -\\frac{1}{2}$: Same as for $\\Delta_1$. The closest integers are $k_3=0$ and $k_3=-1$. The minimum squared distance is $\\frac{1}{4}$. There are $2$ choices for $k_3$.\n\n- For $\\Delta_4 = 0$: The unique closest integer is $k_4=0$. The minimum squared distance is $(0-0)^2=0$. There is $1$ choice for $k_4$.\n\n- For $\\Delta_5 = -\\frac{1}{2}$: Same as for $\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_3$. The closest integers are $k_5=0$ and $k_5=-1$. The minimum squared distance is $\\frac{1}{4}$. There are $2$ choices for $k_5$.\n\nThe number of distinct minimizing geodesics is the number of distinct integer vectors $k$ that achieve the minimum distance. This is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of geodesics = $2 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe common length $L$ of these geodesics is the square root of the minimum squared distance. The minimum squared distance is the sum of the individual minimum squared distances for each component:\n$$ L^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{9}{49} + \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{49} $$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $4 \\times 49 = 196$.\n$$ L^2 = \\frac{3 \\times 49}{196} + \\frac{9 \\times 4}{196} = \\frac{147}{196} + \\frac{36}{196} = \\frac{147 + 36}{196} = \\frac{183}{196} $$\nThe common length is the square root of this value:\n$$ L = \\sqrt{\\frac{183}{196}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{183}}{\\sqrt{196}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{183}}{14} $$\nThe number $183$ can be factored as $3 \\times 61$, both of which are prime, so the square root cannot be simplified further.\n\nThe common length is $\\frac{\\sqrt{183}}{14}$ and the number of distinct minimizing geodesics is $8$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{183}}{14} & 8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2977162"}]}
