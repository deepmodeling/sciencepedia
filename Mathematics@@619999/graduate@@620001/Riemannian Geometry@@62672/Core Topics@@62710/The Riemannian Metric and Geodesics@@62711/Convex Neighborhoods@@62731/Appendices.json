Provide your final answer as a row vector $(r_{c}(p),\\operatorname{inj}(p))$.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information to determine the injectivity and convexity radii for a point on the standard $n$-sphere. The definitions and properties provided are standard in Riemannian geometry. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ is a homogeneous space; its group of isometries (the orthogonal group $O(n+1)$) acts transitively. This means that the local geometry is the same at every point. Consequently, the injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ and the convexity radius $r_{c}(p)$ are constant for all points $p \\in S^n$. We can, without loss of generality, choose $p$ to be a specific point, such as the \"north pole\" in the standard embedding in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\n**1. Determination of the Injectivity Radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$**\n\nThe injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus. The cut locus of $p$ is the set of points $q$ for which there is more than one minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$, or the set of points where geodesics starting at $p$ cease to be minimizing.\n\nThe problem states that geodesics on $S^n$ are great circles. A great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a $2$-dimensional plane passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $p \\in S^n$ be our chosen point. Any geodesic starting at $p$ is an arc of a great circle passing through $p$.\n\nAll great circles passing through $p$ intersect again at a single common point: the antipodal point to $p$, which we denote as $-p$. The distance between $p$ and $-p$ along any such great circle is half the circumference of the circle. Since $S^n$ is a unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, all great circles are unit circles in their respective planes and thus have a circumference of $2\\pi$. The distance along the sphere is the arc length. Therefore, the distance from $p$ to its antipodal point $-p$ is $d(p, -p) = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi) = \\pi$.\n\nFor any point $q \\in S^n$ except $-p$, there is a unique shortest geodesic from $p$ to $q$. At the point $q = -p$, all geodesics starting from $p$ reconverge. Thus, there are infinitely many minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$, each of length $\\pi$. The cut locus of $p$ consists of the single point $\\{-p\\}$.\n\nThe injectivity radius is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus.\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, \\text{cut locus}(p)) = d(p, -p) = \\pi\n$$\nThe exponential map $\\exp_p: B_r(0) \\subset T_p S^n \\to S^n$ is a diffeomorphism for any radius $r < \\pi$. For $r=\\pi$, all vectors on the boundary of the ball $B_\\pi(0)$ in $T_p S^n$ are mapped to the same point $-p$, so the map is not injective. The supremum of such radii is $\\pi$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Convexity Radius $r_c(p)$**\n\nThe convexity radius $r_c(p)$ is the supremum of radii $r > 0$ such that for any two points $q_1, q_2$ in the open geodesic ball $B_r(p)$, the unique minimizing geodesic joining them is entirely contained within $B_r(p)$. An open geodesic ball is defined as $B_r(p) = \\{q \\in S^n \\mid d(p, q) < r \\}$. The condition for the geodesic segment $\\gamma$ connecting $q_1$ and $q_2$ to be in $B_r(p)$ is $d(p, \\gamma(t)) < r$ for all $t$ in its domain.\n\nFirst, for any two points in $B_r(p)$ to be joined by a unique minimizing geodesic, the ball cannot contain any pair of antipodal points. The diameter of $B_r(p)$ is $2r$. Thus, we must have $2r < \\pi$, or $r < \\pi/2$. This provides an initial upper bound on $r_c(p)$.\n\nWe will analyze the convexity of $B_r(p)$ in two cases.\n\n**Case 1: $r \\le \\pi/2$**\nLet $q_1, q_2 \\in B_r(p)$. This means $d(p, q_1) < r$ and $d(p, q_2) < r$. Since $r \\le \\pi/2$, we have $d(p, q_1) < \\pi/2$ and $d(p, q_2) < \\pi/2$. In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, this means $\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle = \\cos(d(p, q_1)) > \\cos(r) \\ge 0$ and $\\langle p, q_2 \\rangle = \\cos(d(p, q_2)) > \\cos(r) \\ge 0$.\n\nLet $\\gamma(t)$ be the unit-speed minimizing geodesic from $q_1$ to $q_2$ of length $L = d(q_1, q_2)$, with $\\gamma(0)=q_1$ and $\\gamma(L)=q_2$. Any point on the minimal geodesic arc is a convex combination of $q_1$ and $q_2$ in a specific sense (e.g., spherical linear interpolation). This implies that if $\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle > 0$ and $\\langle p, q_2 \\rangle > 0$, then for any point $\\gamma(t)$ on the minimal arc, we also have $\\langle p, \\gamma(t) \\rangle > 0$. This means the entire geodesic segment is contained in the open hemisphere centered at $p$, i.e., $d(p, \\gamma(t)) < \\pi/2$.\n\nTo show the more specific condition $d(p, \\gamma(t)) < r$, we use the provided property that for a geodesic $\\gamma$, the function $h(t) = \\langle p, \\gamma(t) \\rangle$ satisfies the differential equation $h''(t) + h(t) = 0$. Since we have established that $h(t) > 0$ for all $t \\in [0, L]$, the equation $h''(t) = -h(t)$ implies that $h''(t) < 0$. The function $h(t)$ is therefore strictly concave on the interval $[0, L]$.\n\nThe minimum value of a strictly concave function on a closed interval occurs at one of the endpoints. Thus, for any $t \\in [0, L]$:\n$$\nh(t) \\ge \\min(h(0), h(L)) = \\min(\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle, \\langle p, q_2 \\rangle)\n$$\nIn terms of distances, this is:\n$$\n\\cos(d(p, \\gamma(t))) \\ge \\min(\\cos(d(p, q_1)), \\cos(d(p, q_2)))\n$$\nSince $d(p, q_1) < r$ and $d(p, q_2) < r$, and the cosine function is strictly decreasing on $[0, \\pi]$, we have $\\cos(d(p, q_1)) > \\cos(r)$ and $\\cos(d(p, q_2)) > \\cos(r)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\cos(d(p, \\gamma(t))) > \\cos(r)\n$$\nApplying the strictly decreasing function $\\arccos$ to both sides reverses the inequality:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t)) < r\n$$\nThis holds for all $t \\in [0, L]$, so the entire geodesic segment is contained in $B_r(p)$. This demonstrates that for any $r \\le \\pi/2$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is a convex set.\n\n**Case 2: $r > \\pi/2$**\nLet $r \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$. We will show that $B_r(p)$ is not convex by finding a pair of points $q_1, q_2 \\in B_r(p)$ for which the connecting geodesic is not fully contained in $B_r(p)$.\nConsider two points $q_1, q_2$ on the boundary of the ball, $\\partial B_r(p)$, such that $d(p, q_1) = d(p, q_2) = r$. Let $\\gamma$ be the minimizing geodesic between them of length $L=d(q_1,q_2)$. By symmetry, the point on $\\gamma$ that is furthest from $p$ is its midpoint, $m = \\gamma(L/2)$. The distance of the midpoint $m$ from $p$ is given by the formula (derived from spherical trigonometry or vector analysis):\n$$\n\\cos(d(p, m)) = \\frac{\\langle p, q_1 \\rangle + \\langle p, q_2 \\rangle}{\\|q_1+q_2\\|} = \\frac{\\cos(r) + \\cos(r)}{2\\cos(L/2)} = \\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)}\n$$\nWe want to check if $d(p, m) < r$. This is equivalent to $\\cos(d(p, m)) > \\cos(r)$ because $d(p,m)$ and $r$ are in $[0,\\pi]$ and $\\cos$ is decreasing. So we must check if $\\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)} > \\cos(r)$.\n\nSince $r \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$, we have $\\cos(r) < 0$. Multiplying the inequality by $\\cos(r)$ reverses the sign:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\cos(L/2)} < 1\n$$\nThis would imply $\\cos(L/2) > 1$, which is impossible for any real $L$. For any distinct points $q_1, q_2$, we have $L > 0$, which means $\\cos(L/2) < 1$. Thus, the inequality $\\frac{1}{\\cos(L/2)} < 1$ is never satisfied. On the contrary, we have $\\frac{1}{\\cos(L/2)} > 1$.\nThis leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)} < \\cos(r)\n$$\nApplying $\\arccos$ reverses the inequality again:\n$$\nd(p, m) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\cos(L/2)}\\right) > \\arccos(\\cos(r)) = r\n$$\nThis shows that for any two points $q_1, q_2$ on the boundary of $B_r(p)$ (with $r>\\pi/2$), the midpoint of the geodesic connecting them lies outside the ball $B_r(p)$. By continuity, we can choose points just inside the open ball $B_r(p)$ whose geodesic midpoint will also lie outside $B_r(p)$. Thus, for any $r > \\pi/2$, the ball $B_r(p)$ is not convex.\n\n**Conclusion for $r_c(p)$**\nWe have shown that $B_r(p)$ is convex for all $r \\le \\pi/2$ and not convex for any $r > \\pi/2$. The supremum of such radii $r$ is therefore $\\pi/2$.\n$$\nr_c(p) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\n\n**Final Result**\nThe convexity radius is $r_c(p) = \\pi/2$ and the injectivity radius is $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\pi$. The final answer is the row vector $(r_c(p), \\operatorname{inj}(p))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} & \\pi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2972850"}, {"introduction": "Having established the benchmark case of the sphere, we now explore how global topology can dramatically alter local geometric properties.

These quantities are the injectivity radius, $\\operatorname{inj}(M)$, and the largest radius $r^{\\ast}$ for which all open geodesic balls of radius less than $r^{\\ast}$ are strongly convex.\n\nLet $M$ denote $\\mathbb{RP}^n$. This space is defined as the quotient of the $n$-dimensional unit sphere $S^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by the antipodal map $A(x) = -x$. The canonical projection $\\pi: S^n \\to M$ is a $2$-sheeted Riemannian covering. Since $S^n$ with its standard induced metric has constant sectional curvature $1$, and $\\pi$ is a local isometry, $M$ also has constant sectional curvature $1$. The distance $d_M(p, q)$ between two points $p, q \\in M$ is given by $d_M(p, q) = \\arccos(|\\langle \\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q} \\rangle|)$, where $\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q} \\in S^n$ are any lifts of $p$ and $q$ (i.e., $\\pi(\\tilde{p})=p, \\pi(\\tilde{q})=q$). This formula can be seen as the minimum of the spherical distances between the possible pairs of lifts: $d_M(p, q) = \\min\\{d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}), d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{q})\\}$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Injectivity Radius $\\operatorname{inj}(M)$**\n\nThe injectivity radius at a point $p \\in M$, denoted $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is the supremum of radii $r > 0$ such that the exponential map $\\exp_p: B_r(0) \\subset T_pM \\to M$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image. For a complete homogeneous manifold like $M$, the injectivity radius is constant across all points. For a manifold given as a quotient $M = \\tilde{M}/\\Gamma$ by a properly discontinuous group of isometries $\\Gamma$, the injectivity radius at a point $p=\\pi(\\tilde{p})$ is given by\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{g \\in \\Gamma \\setminus \\{\\text{id}\\}} d_{\\tilde{M}}(\\tilde{p}, g(\\tilde{p})) $$\nIn our case, $\\tilde{M} = S^n$ and the group of deck transformations is $\\Gamma = \\{\\text{id}, A\\}$, where $A$ is the antipodal map $A(x) = -x$. The only non-trivial element is $A$. Thus, for any point $p \\in M$ with lift $\\tilde{p} \\in S^n$, the injectivity radius is:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, A(\\tilde{p})) = \\frac{1}{2} d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{p}) $$\nThe distance between a point $\\tilde{p}$ on the unit sphere $S^n$ and its antipode $-\\tilde{p}$ is the length of a great semicircle, which is $\\pi$. The distance $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{p}) = \\arccos(\\langle \\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{p} \\rangle) = \\arccos(-1) = \\pi$.\nTherefore, the injectivity radius at any point $p$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nSince this value is independent of the point $p$, the injectivity radius of the manifold $M$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(M) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nAlternatively, the injectivity radius at $p$ is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus, $C(p)$. The cut locus of $p=\\pi(\\tilde{p})$ consists of points $q=\\pi(\\tilde{q})$ for which there are at least two minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$. This occurs when the two paths on the sphere, from $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{q}$ and from $\\tilde{p}$ to $-\\tilde{q}$, have the same length. That is, $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}) = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{q})$. Since $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{q}) = \\pi - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q})$, this equality implies $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}) = \\pi/2$. The distance from $p$ to such a point $q$ is precisely $d_M(p, q) = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}) = \\pi/2$. So, the cut locus is at a constant distance of $\\pi/2$ from $p$, confirming that $\\operatorname{inj}(M) = \\pi/2$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Strong Convexity Radius $r^{\\ast}$**\n\nA set $U \\subset M$ is defined as strongly convex if for any two points $x, y \\in U$, there is a unique minimizing geodesic segment between $x$ and $y$, and this entire segment is contained in $U$. We seek the largest radius $r^{\\ast} > 0$ such that for any $r \\in (0, r^{\\ast})$, every open geodesic ball $B(p, r)$ is strongly convex.\n\nLet's analyze the two conditions for strong convexity for an open ball $B(p, r) \\subset M$. Let $p \\in M$ be the center of the ball, and let $\\tilde{p} \\in S^n$ be a lift of $p$. For $r \\in (0, \\operatorname{inj}(M)) = (0, \\pi/2)$, the ball $B(p, r)$ in $M$ is isometric to the ball $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$ in $S^n$.\n\nLet $x, y$ be two distinct points in $B(p, r)$. Let their lifts be $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$. This means $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) < r$ and $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{y}) < r$. The geodesics in $M$ from $x$ to $y$ are projections of geodesics in $S^n$ connecting a lift of $x$ to a lift of $y$. The two lifts of $y$ are $\\tilde{y}$ and $-\\tilde{y}$. So we must consider geodesics from $\\tilde{x}$ to $\\tilde{y}$ and from $\\tilde{x}$ to $-\\tilde{y}$. Their lengths are $L_1 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y})$ and $L_2 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y})$. The distance in $M$ is $d_M(x, y) = \\min(L_1, L_2)$.\n\n**Condition 1: Uniqueness of the minimizing geodesic.**\nFor the minimizing geodesic to be unique, we must have $L_1 \\neq L_2$, which is equivalent to $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) \\neq \\pi/2$. We must ensure this holds for any pair of points $x, y \\in B(p, r)$.\nBy the triangle inequality in $S^n$:\n$L_1 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) \\le d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p}) + d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{y}) < r + r = 2r$.\nSince $x, y$ are in the open ball, the distances from the center are strictly less than $r$. The supremum of the distance between two points in an open ball of radius $r$ is $2r$. Thus, for any $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$, we have $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) < 2r$.\nTo guarantee uniqueness, we must prevent this distance from reaching $\\pi/2$. We must impose $2r \\le \\pi/2$, which implies $r \\le \\pi/4$.\nIf $r \\le \\pi/4$, then for any $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$, we have $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) < 2r \\le \\pi/2$. The strict inequality $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) < \\pi/2$ holds, ensuring uniqueness.\nSpecifically, for $r \\le \\pi/4$, we have $L_1 < \\pi/2$. Also, by the reverse triangle inequality, $L_2 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y}) \\ge |d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},-\\tilde{y})| = |d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) - (\\pi-d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{y}))|$. A more useful bound is $L_2 \\ge d_{S^n}(\\tilde{q}, -\\tilde{y}) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{q}, \\tilde{x})$ for any $\\tilde{q}$. Using $\\tilde{q}=\\tilde{p}$: $L_2 \\ge d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{y}) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) = (\\pi - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{y})) - d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) > \\pi - r - r = \\pi - 2r$.\nFor $r \\le \\pi/4$, $\\pi - 2r \\ge \\pi/2$. So $L_2 > \\pi/2$ while $L_1 < \\pi/2$. Thus $L_1$ is strictly smaller, and the minimizing geodesic is unique. It is the projection of the geodesic segment in $S^n$ between $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$.\n\n**Condition 2: Containment of the geodesic.**\nThe unique minimizing geodesic must lie entirely within $B(p, r)$. This means its lift, the segment from $\\tilde{x}$ to $\\tilde{y}$, must lie within $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$. This is a convexity property of balls in $S^n$. A geodesic ball of radius $\\rho$ in a space of constant curvature $K=1$ is convex if $\\rho \\le \\pi/(2\\sqrt{K}) = \\pi/2$.\nSince our condition so far is $r \\le \\pi/4$, which satisfies $r < \\pi/2$, the ball $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$ in $S^n$ is convex. This means for any $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r)$, the minimizing geodesic between them is contained in $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$.\nSo, for any $r \\in (0, \\pi/4]$, both conditions for strong convexity are met for any open ball $B(p, r)$.\n\n**Finding the largest radius $r^{\\ast}$.**\nWe have shown that for any $r \\in (0, \\pi/4)$, the ball $B(p, r)$ is strongly convex. So $r^{\\ast} \\ge \\pi/4$.\nNow we must show that for any $r > \\pi/4$, there exists a ball $B(p, r)$ that is not strongly convex.\nLet $r > \\pi/4$. Choose a radius $r'$ such that $\\pi/4 < r' < r$.\nLet $\\tilde{p} \\in S^n$ be a point, say the north pole. Consider two points $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ at spherical distance $r'$ from $\\tilde{p}$, chosen to lie on the same great circle passing through $\\tilde{p}$ but on opposite sides. For instance, if $\\tilde{p} = \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$, we can choose $\\tilde{x} = (\\sin r') \\mathbf{e}_1 + (\\cos r') \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$ and $\\tilde{y} = (-\\sin r') \\mathbf{e}_1 + (\\cos r') \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$.\nThe points $x=\\pi(\\tilde{x})$ and $y=\\pi(\\tilde{y})$ are in $B(p, r)$ because $d_M(p, x) = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{x}) = r' < r$, and similarly for $y$.\nLet's find the minimizing geodesic between $x$ and $y$. We compare the lengths of the paths lifted to $S^n$:\n$L_1 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) = \\arccos(\\langle \\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\rangle) = \\arccos(-\\sin^2 r' + \\cos^2 r') = \\arccos(\\cos(2r')) = 2r'$.\n$L_2 = d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y})$. Here $-\\tilde{y} = (\\sin r') \\mathbf{e}_1 - (\\cos r') \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$.\n$d_{S^n}(\\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y}) = \\arccos(\\langle \\tilde{x}, -\\tilde{y} \\rangle) = \\arccos(\\sin^2 r' - \\cos^2 r') = \\arccos(-\\cos(2r')) = \\pi - 2r'$.\nSince we chose $r' > \\pi/4$, we have $2r' > \\pi/2$. Thus $L_1 > \\pi/2$.\nConversely, $\\pi - 2r' < \\pi/2$. So $L_2 < L_1$.\nThe unique minimizing geodesic between $x$ and $y$ is the projection of the geodesic segment $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ in $S^n$ from $\\tilde{x}$ to $-\\tilde{y}$.\nNow we check if this geodesic segment is contained in $B(p, r)$. This requires its lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ to be contained in $B(\\tilde{p}, r)$. Let's find the point on $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ that is furthest from $\\tilde{p}$. By symmetry, this will be the midpoint of $\\tilde{\\gamma}$.\nThe midpoint $\\tilde{z}$ of the geodesic arc from $\\tilde{x}$ to $-\\tilde{y}$ is proportional to $\\tilde{x} + (-\\tilde{y}) = (2 \\sin r')\\mathbf{e}_1$. Normalizing, we get $\\tilde{z} = \\mathbf{e}_1$.\nThe distance from $\\tilde{p} = \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$ to this midpoint is $d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{z}) = \\arccos(\\langle \\mathbf{e}_{n+1}, \\mathbf{e}_1 \\rangle) = \\arccos(0) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, the minimizing geodesic between $x$ and $y$ contains a point $z = \\pi(\\tilde{z})$ whose distance from $p$ is $d_M(p, z) = d_M(\\pi(\\tilde{p}), \\pi(\\tilde{z})) = \\min(d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},\\tilde{z}), d_{S^n}(\\tilde{p},-\\tilde{z})) = \\min(\\pi/2, \\pi/2) = \\pi/2$.\nFor the geodesic to be contained in the open ball $B(p, r)$, this point $z$ must satisfy $d_M(p, z) < r$. This requires $\\pi/2 < r$.\nHowever, our construction works for any $r > \\pi/4$. If we take $r$ such that $\\pi/4 < r \\le \\pi/2$, we have found two points $x,y \\in B(p,r)$ whose minimizing geodesic contains a point $z$ at distance $\\pi/2$ from $p$. Since $r \\le \\pi/2$, this point $z$ is not in the open ball $B(p, r)$. Thus, the ball is not strongly convex.\nThis shows that for any $r > \\pi/4$, there is a ball of radius $r$ which is not strongly convex. Therefore, the largest radius $r^{\\ast}$ for which the property holds for all $r \\in (0, r^{\\ast})$ is $\\pi/4$.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The injectivity radius is $\\operatorname{inj}(M) = \\pi/2$.\n- The largest radius for strong convexity of open balls is $r^{\\ast} = \\pi/4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} & \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2972842"}, {"introduction": "We now elevate our analysis from specific examples to a broad and important class of manifolds: the Compact Rank-One Symmetric Spaces (CROSSes), which include complex and quaternionic projective spaces. These spaces are characterized by a specific curvature structure, where the first conjugate point along any geodesic is determined by the maximum sectional curvature. This advanced exercise requires you to use the Jacobi equation to connect the spectrum of the curvature operator directly to the convexity radius, unifying our previous findings into a more general principle [@problem_id:2972845].", "problem": "Let $M$ be a Compact Rank-One Symmetric Space (CROSS) other than the sphere, equipped with its canonical Riemannian metric normalized so that the sectional curvatures satisfy $1 \\leq K \\leq 4$ and all geodesics are closed with common period $\\pi$. Examples include complex projective space $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}$, quaternionic projective space $\\mathbb{H}P^{n}$, and the Cayley projective plane $\\mathbb{O}P^{2}$. \n\nRecall the following standard definitions and facts:\n- The convexity radius at a point $p \\in M$, denoted $r_{c}(p)$, is the supremum of $r>0$ such that the open geodesic ball $B_{r}(p)$ is strongly convex, meaning that any two points in $B_{r}(p)$ are joined by a unique minimizing geodesic that is entirely contained in $B_{r}(p)$. The convexity radius of $M$, $r_{c}(M)$, is the common value of $r_{c}(p)$ for all $p$ by homogeneity.\n- Conjugate points along a geodesic $\\gamma$ occur at times $t>0$ for which there exists a nontrivial normal Jacobi field $J$ with $J(0)=J(t)=0$. The smallest such $t$ is called the conjugate radius along $\\gamma$.\n- In a CROSS of the type specified, the curvature operator $R(\\dot{\\gamma},\\cdot)\\dot{\\gamma}$ along any unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma$ has exactly two positive eigenvalues $K_{1}=1$ and $K_{2}=4$, corresponding to orthogonal invariant subspaces of the tangent space transverse to $\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n\nStarting from the Jacobi equation and the geometry of geodesic spheres, determine the exact value of the convexity radius $r_{c}(M)$ of such a manifold $M$. Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression. No rounding is required, and no units are involved. Express the result as a multiple of $\\pi$.", "solution": "The convexity radius of a Riemannian manifold is determined by its curvature and topology, specifically through the behavior of Jacobi fields and the location of conjugate points. Let $p \\in M$ be an arbitrary point. Since $M$ is a symmetric space, the geometry is homogeneous, and the convexity radius $r_c(p)$ is independent of $p$. We denote this common value by $r_c(M)$.\n\nThe key to finding geometric quantities like the conjugate radius and convexity radius is the Jacobi equation along a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p = \\gamma(0)$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $J(t)$ is a Jacobi field normal to $\\gamma(t)$, and $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$.\n\nA point $\\gamma(t_0)$ for $t_0 > 0$ is conjugate to $p = \\gamma(0)$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_0)=0$. The conjugate radius is the smallest such $t_0$.\n\nThe problem states that for any unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma$, the curvature operator $R_t := R(\\cdot, \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ has two distinct positive eigenvalues, $K_1=1$ and $K_2=4$. This allows us to simplify the Jacobi equation. Let $\\{e_i(t)\\}$ be a parallel-transported orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$ with $e_n(t)=\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The normal space to $\\gamma$ is spanned by $\\{e_1(t), \\dots, e_{n-1}(t)\\}$. We can choose this basis such that it diagonalizes the curvature operator $R_t$. A normal Jacobi field can be written as $J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i(t) e_i(t)$. The Jacobi equation decouples into a system of scalar ordinary differential equations for the components $j_i(t)$:\n$$ j_i''(t) + K_i j_i(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $K_i$ is the sectional curvature of the $2$-plane spanned by $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ and $e_i(t)$. For a CROSS, these curvatures are constant along the geodesic and are precisely the given eigenvalues of the curvature operator. Thus, for any Jacobi field, its components satisfy either $j''(t) + j(t) = 0$ or $j''(t) + 4j(t) = 0$.\n\nThe initial condition $J(0)=0$ implies $j_i(0)=0$ for all $i$.\nFor the eigenvalue $K_1=1$, the solution is $j(t) = c_1 \\sin(\\sqrt{1}t) = c_1 \\sin(t)$. This function first vanishes for $t>0$ at $t=\\pi$.\nFor the eigenvalue $K_2=4$, the solution is $j(t) = c_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{4}t) = c_2 \\sin(2t)$. This function first vanishes for $t>0$ when $2t=\\pi$, which gives $t=\\pi/2$.\n\nA conjugate point exists at time $t_0$ if some non-trivial Jacobi field vanishes. This occurs at the smallest of the possible vanishing times. Comparing the two cases, the first conjugate point along any geodesic occurs at a distance $t = \\min(\\pi, \\pi/2) = \\pi/2$.\n\nIn a simply connected compact symmetric space, such as the CROSSes under consideration, the injectivity radius $i(p)$ at any point $p$ is equal to the distance to the first conjugate point along any geodesic from $p$. Therefore, the injectivity radius of $M$ is $i(M) = \\pi/2$. This result is consistent with the provided information that all geodesics have period $\\pi$, as the injectivity radius is also half the length of the shortest closed geodesic, which is $\\pi/2$.\n\nThe final step is to relate the injectivity radius to the convexity radius. For a Riemannian manifold with non-negative sectional curvature (in our case $K \\geq 1$), it is a standard result that a geodesic ball $B_r(p)$ is strongly convex if $r \\leq i(p)/2$. Thus, $r_c(M) \\geq i(M)/2$.\nLet's verify this. Let $r < i(M)/2 = \\pi/4$. For any two points $x, y \\in B_r(p)$, we have $d(x,p) < r$ and $d(y,p) < r$. By the triangle inequality, $d(x,y) \\leq d(x,p) + d(p,y) < 2r < i(M)$. Since the distance between $x$ and $y$ is less than the injectivity radius, there is a unique minimizing geodesic $\\gamma$ connecting them. This confirms the uniqueness part of strong convexity.\nTo show that $\\gamma$ is contained in $B_r(p)$, consider the function $f(t) = d(p, \\gamma(t))$. Since the sectional curvature is non-negative, by the Rauch comparison theorem, $f(t)$ is a convex function. Thus, its maximum on the interval of parametrization is achieved at the endpoints. This means $d(p,z) \\leq \\max(d(p,x), d(p,y)) < r$ for any point $z$ on $\\gamma$. So, $\\gamma$ is contained in $B_r(p)$. This proves that $r_c(M) \\geq i(M)/2 = \\pi/4$.\n\nTo show that this is an equality, we must show that $r_c(M) \\leq \\pi/4$. A CROSS contains totally geodesic $2$-spheres of maximal curvature $K_{max}=4$. Let $S$ be one such sphere passing through $p$. This sphere is isometric to a standard sphere of radius $R = 1/\\sqrt{K_{max}} = 1/\\sqrt{4} = 1/2$.\nThe convexity radius of the manifold $M$ cannot be greater than the convexity radius of any of its totally geodesic submanifolds. The convexity radius of a standard sphere of radius $R$ is known to be $\\pi R/2$. For our submanifold $S$, this is $r_c(S) = \\pi (1/2) / 2 = \\pi/4$.\nThe reasoning for this is that a ball of radius $r > \\pi R / 2$ on a sphere is not convex. For example, a ball of radius slightly larger than $\\pi/4$ on $S$ contains two points $x,y$ near the boundary such that the unique minimizing geodesic between them passes outside the ball (near the 'south pole' if $p$ is the 'north pole'). Since this configuration can be realized within a ball in $M$, any ball in $M$ with radius greater than $\\pi/4$ is not guaranteed to be convex.\nTherefore, we must have $r_c(M) \\leq r_c(S) = \\pi/4$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities, $r_c(M) \\geq \\pi/4$ and $r_c(M) \\leq \\pi/4$, we conclude that the convexity radius is precisely $\\pi/4$.\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1.
