The existence of a Riemannian metric on $M$ is equivalent to the existence of a torsion-free affine connection on $TM$ whose curvature vanishes everywhere.\n\nC. In Riemannian geometry, the Riemann curvature tensor is defined only after choosing a Riemannian metric via the unique torsion-free, metric-compatible connection, and its values depend on the choice of $g$.\n\nD.

Cover $M$ by coordinate charts $\\{(U_{i}, \\varphi_{i})\\}_{i \\in I}$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. On each $U_{i}$, use the standard Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and pull it back to $U_{i}$ to obtain a smooth, symmetric, positive-definite $(0,2)$-tensor $g_{i} = \\varphi_{i}^{*}\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$. Choose a locally finite partition of unity $\\{\\psi_{i}\\}_{i \\in I}$ subordinate to $\\{U_{i}\\}$.

Each $g_{i}$ is symmetric, and linear combinations with scalar coefficients preserve symmetry. For positive-definiteness, fix $p \\in M$ and $v \\in T_{p}M \\setminus \\{0\\}$. For every $i$ with $\\psi_{i}(p) > 0$, one has $g_{i,p}(v,v) > 0$. Since $\\psi_{i}(p) \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{i} \\psi_{i}(p) = 1$, it follows that\n$$\ng_{p}(v,v) = \\sum_{i \\in I} \\psi_{i}(p) \\, g_{i,p}(v,v) > 0,\n$$\nbecause it is a convex combination of strictly positive numbers. Thus $g$ is a Riemannian metric. This construction uses only partitions of unity and local inner products; no curvature constraints are invoked at any step. Therefore, the existence of a Riemannian metric is independent of curvature requirements.\n\nHow curvature enters only after a metric choice. The Riemann curvature tensor in Riemannian geometry is defined via the Levi-Civita connection associated to a chosen metric. Given a Riemannian metric $g$, there exists a unique affine connection $\\nabla$ on $TM$ that is torsion-free and satisfies $\\nabla g = 0$. This is the Levi-Civita connection, determined by $g$. The curvature tensor $R^{g}$ is then defined, for vector fields $X, Y, Z$, by\n$$\nR^{g}(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z - \\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z,\n$$\nwhich depends on $\\nabla$, hence on $g$. Different choices of $g$ yield different Levi-Civita connections and potentially different curvature tensors. Absent a choice of metric (or another canonical connection), a smooth manifold does not carry a canonical notion of Riemannian curvature. While one can choose arbitrary affine connections $\\nabla$ on $TM$ without a metric and form their curvature tensors $R^{\\nabla}$, such choices are not canonical; Riemannian curvature refers to the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection of a particular metric.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This asserts exactly the standard partition-of-unity construction of a Riemannian metric on a smooth, paracompact manifold and explicitly notes that curvature conditions play no role in the construction. The argument above establishes this directly. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This claims equivalence between the existence of a Riemannian metric and the existence of a torsion-free flat connection (curvature zero). The existence of a Riemannian metric does not imply flatness; many Riemannian manifolds have nonzero curvature. Conversely, the existence of a flat torsion-free affine connection does not characterize the existence of a Riemannian metric, and in any case, smooth manifolds admit affine connections regardless of metric, and flatness is a strong additional condition unrelated to the metricâ€™s existence. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This states that in Riemannian geometry, the curvature tensor is defined only after choosing a metric via the unique torsion-free, metric-compatible connection, and that it depends on $g$. As explained, $R^{g}$ arises from the Levi-Civita connection associated to $g$, so it depends on $g$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. This claims a canonical notion of Riemann curvature on any smooth manifold without any structure. There is no canonical connection or metric on a general smooth manifold, so there is no canonical Riemannian curvature. Any curvature tensor requires a choice (of connection), and in Riemannian geometry, the canonical choice is the Levi-Civita connection determined by a chosen metric. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This is a linear-algebraic fact used in the gluing construction: convex combinations of symmetric positive-definite bilinear forms are symmetric positive-definite. Symmetry is preserved by linear combination, and for any nonzero $v$, each $b_{i}(v,v) > 0$; with $\\lambda_{i} \\geq 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_{i} = 1$, one has $b(v,v) = \\sum \\lambda_{i} b_{i}(v,v) > 0$.
