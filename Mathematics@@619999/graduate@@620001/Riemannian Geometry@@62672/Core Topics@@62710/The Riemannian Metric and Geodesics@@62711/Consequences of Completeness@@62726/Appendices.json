For this manifold $(M,g)$, the Christoffel symbols are all zero, which means the geodesics are straight lines, just as in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The Riemannian distance $d_g(p,q)$ between two points $p, q \\in M$ is the length of the shortest path between them that lies entirely within $M$. Since $M$ is a convex set, the straight line segment connecting any two points $p, q \\in M$ is contained in $M$. This straight line is the unique geodesic between $p$ and $q$, and its length is the Euclidean distance $\\|p-q\\|$. Therefore, the induced distance function $d_g$ is identical to the standard Euclidean distance on $M$.\n\nFirst, we address the task of showing that $(M,g)$ is not complete. We must exhibit a unit-speed geodesic that leaves $M$ in finite time and use this to show the failure of metric completeness as per the provided definitions.\nLet us consider a geodesic starting at the origin $p_0 = 0 \\in M$. A unit-speed geodesic starting from the origin can be parametrized as $\\gamma(t) = t v$, where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a unit vector, i.e., $\\|v\\|=1$. For definiteness, we can choose $v = e_1 = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$. The geodesic is then $\\gamma(t) = t e_1$. This path is a straight line. The condition for the path to be within $M$ is $\\|\\gamma(t)\\| < 1$. We have $\\|\\gamma(t)\\| = \\|t e_1\\| = |t| \\|e_1\\| = |t|$. Thus, the geodesic is contained in $M$ for $t \\in (-1, 1)$. At $t=1$, the geodesic reaches the point $e_1$, for which $\\|e_1\\|=1$. This point lies on the boundary of $M$ and is therefore not in $M$. Similarly, at $t=-1$, it reaches $-e_1 \\notin M$. The maximal interval of definition for this geodesic is $(-1, 1)$, which is not all of $\\mathbb{R}$. This demonstrates that $(M,g)$ is not geodesically complete.\nTo show this implies metric incompleteness, consider the sequence of points $p_k = \\gamma(1 - \\frac{1}{k}) = (1 - \\frac{1}{k})e_1$ for integer $k \\ge 2$. Each point $p_k$ is in $M$ since $\\|p_k\\| = 1 - \\frac{1}{k} < 1$. Let's check if this sequence is a Cauchy sequence with respect to $d_g$. For any integers $k, j \\ge 2$, the distance is:\n$$d_g(p_k, p_j) = \\|p_k - p_j\\| = \\left\\|\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k}\\right)e_1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{j}\\right)e_1\\right\\| = \\left|\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{j}\\right)\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{j} - \\frac{1}{k}\\right|$$\nAs $k,j \\to \\infty$, this distance approaches $0$. Thus, $\\{p_k\\}_{k\\ge2}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_g)$. However, the limit of this sequence in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} p_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{k})e_1 = e_1$. The point $e_1$ is not in $M$ because $\\|e_1\\|=1$. Therefore, the Cauchy sequence $\\{p_k\\}$ does not converge to a point within $M$. By the definition of metric completeness, $(M,g)$ is not a complete metric space.\n\nNext, we construct a subset $S \\subset M$ that is closed in $M$ and bounded with respect to $d_g$, but is not compact. A key consequence of a metric space not being complete is that the Heine-Borel property (a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded) fails. We will construct such a set $S$ that \"reaches for\" the boundary of $M$ at two opposite points. Let $e_1$ be the first standard basis vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We define the set $S$ as:\n$$S = \\{ x e_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid x \\in (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1) \\}$$\nLet's verify the properties of $S$:\n1.  **$S$ is bounded with respect to $d_g$**: For any point $p = x e_1 \\in S$, we have $|x| < 1$, so $\\|p\\| = |x| < 1$. The set $S$ is contained within the unit ball, and its diameter is finite (as we will compute), so it is bounded.\n2.  **$S$ is closed in $M$**: A set $A \\subset M$ is closed in the subspace topology of $M$ if $A = \\bar{A} \\cap M$, where $\\bar{A}$ is the closure of $A$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For our set $S$, its closure in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ includes the limit points. The set of scalar values is a union of two intervals, so its closure is $\\bar{I} = [-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$. The closure of $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is thus $\\bar{S} = \\{ x e_1 \\mid x \\in \\bar{I} \\}$. We find the intersection of $\\bar{S}$ with $M$:\n    $$\\bar{S} \\cap M = \\{ p \\in \\bar{S} \\mid \\|p\\| < 1 \\} = \\{ x e_1 \\mid x \\in \\bar{I} \\text{ and } \\|x e_1\\| < 1 \\}$$\n    The condition $\\|x e_1\\| = |x| < 1$ applied to $x \\in [-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ excludes the endpoints $x=-1$ and $x=1$. This leaves the set of values $(-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, which is the original set of scalars defining $S$. Thus, $\\bar{S} \\cap M = S$, which proves that $S$ is a closed set in $M$.\n3.  **$S$ is not compact**: We demonstrate this by showing $S$ is not sequentially compact. Consider the sequence $\\{q_k\\}_{k\\ge2}$ given by $q_k = (1 - \\frac{1}{k})e_1$. Every point $q_k$ is in $S$ since $\\frac{1}{2} \\le 1 - \\frac{1}{k} < 1$ for $k \\ge 2$. This sequence converges to $e_1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since any subsequence of $\\{q_k\\}$ must also converge to $e_1$, and $e_1 \\notin M$, no subsequence of $\\{q_k\\}$ can converge to a limit inside $M$. Therefore, we have found a sequence in $S$ that has no convergent subsequence with a limit in $M$. This shows $S$ is not sequentially compact and hence not compact.\n\nFinally, we compute the diameter of our constructed set $S$ with respect to the induced Riemannian distance $d_g$. The diameter is defined as $\\operatorname{diam}(S) = \\sup_{p,q \\in S} d_g(p,q)$.\nAs established, $d_g(p,q) = \\|p-q\\|$. Let $p = x e_1$ and $q = y e_1$ be two points in $S$, where $x, y \\in (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. The distance between them is:\n$$d_g(p,q) = \\|x e_1 - y e_1\\| = \\|(x-y)e_1\\| = |x-y|$$\nWe need to find the supremum of $|x-y|$ for all possible choices of $x$ and $y$ from the set $I = (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. The distance $|x-y|$ is maximized when $x$ and $y$ are chosen from the opposite ends of the interval set $I$. We want to find:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}(S) = \\sup_{x, y \\in I} |x-y|$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\sup(I) - \\inf(I)$.\nThe supremum of the set $I$ is:\n$$\\sup\\left( (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1) \\right) = 1$$\nThe infimum of the set $I$ is:\n$$\\inf\\left( (-1, -\\frac{1}{2}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, 1) \\right) = -1$$\nThe diameter of $S$ is therefore:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}(S) = 1 - (-1) = 2$$\nThe diameter of the set $S$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2972388"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful consequences of completeness is the guarantee that a shortest path, a minimizing geodesic, exists between any two points.

Express your final answer as an exact real number.", "solution": "1) To prove that $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete, we must show that there exists at least one geodesic that cannot be extended to a map defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$. The manifold is $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ with the standard Euclidean metric $g$. A geodesic in $(M,g)$ is a curve $\\gamma(t)$ that is locally a straight line. Since the metric is inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ where the Christoffel symbols are all zero, the geodesic equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$ simplifies to $\\ddot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$. The solutions are of the form $\\gamma(t) = at+b$ for constant vectors $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, which represent straight lines.\nA geodesic in $M$ is thus a straight line segment that is contained in $M$. For $(M,g)$ to be geodesically complete, every such geodesic, say $\\gamma: (t_1, t_2) \\to M$, must be extendable to a geodesic $\\tilde{\\gamma}: \\mathbb{R} \\to M$.\nConsider the geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ given by $\\gamma(t) = (1-t, 0)$. This is a straight line passing through the point $p=(1,0)$ at $t=0$ with velocity vector $(-1,0)$. This curve is in $M$ as long as $\\gamma(t) \\neq (0,0)$. The condition $\\gamma(t) = (0,0)$ corresponds to $1-t=0$, which occurs at $t=1$.\nThus, the curve $\\gamma(t)$ restricted to any open interval not containing $t=1$, for example $\\gamma: (-\\infty, 1) \\to M$, is a geodesic in $M$. The maximal interval of definition for this geodesic that contains $t=0$ is $(-\\infty, 1)$. As $t \\to 1^-$, the curve $\\gamma(t)$ approaches the point $(0,0)$, which is not in $M$. Therefore, it is impossible to extend this geodesic to be defined at $t=1$ and beyond as a map into $M$. Since we have found a geodesic that is not defined for all of $\\mathbb{R}$, the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete.\n\n2) We are given the points $p=(1,0)$ and $q=(-1,0)$ in $M$. In the ambient space $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g)$, the unique geodesic connecting $p$ and $q$ is the straight line segment parametrized by $\\gamma(t) = p+t(q-p) = (1,0) + t(-2,0) = (1-2t, 0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. The length of this path is $2$.\nHowever, this path is not a curve in $M$ because for $t = 1/2$, $\\gamma(1/2) = (0,0)$, a point not in $M$. A geodesic in $M$ must, by definition, be a curve contained entirely within $M$. Since geodesics in $(M,g)$ are straight line segments, and the only straight line segment connecting $p$ and $q$ is not in $M$, there is no geodesic in $M$ joining $p$ and $q$. A fortiori, there cannot be a length-minimizing geodesic. The Hopf-Rinow theorem states that in a geodesically complete manifold, any two points can be joined by a minimizing geodesic. Our manifold is incomplete, and this pair of points provides a counterexample to the conclusion of the theorem.\n\nTo exhibit a minimizing sequence of curves, consider a family of curves $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}$ for $\\epsilon > 0$. Each curve $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}$ consists of three parts:\n(i) A straight line segment from $p=(1,0)$ to the point $(\\epsilon, 0)$.\n(ii) A semicircle in the upper half-plane, centered at the origin, with radius $\\epsilon$, from $(\\epsilon, 0)$ to $(-\\epsilon, 0)$.\n(iii) A straight line segment from $(-\\epsilon, 0)$ to $q=(-1,0)$.\n\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, the curve $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}$ is a piecewise smooth curve entirely contained in $M$. We calculate its length, $L(\\gamma_{\\epsilon})$:\nThe length of segment (i) is $1-\\epsilon$.\nThe length of the semicircular arc (ii) is $\\pi \\epsilon$.\nThe length of segment (iii) is $1-\\epsilon$.\nThe total length is $L(\\gamma_{\\epsilon}) = (1-\\epsilon) + \\pi \\epsilon + (1-\\epsilon) = 2 + (\\pi - 2)\\epsilon$.\nThe sequence $\\{\\gamma_{\\epsilon}\\}_{\\epsilon>0}$ is a sequence of admissible curves joining $p$ and $q$. The infimum of the lengths of all admissible curves is $d(p,q)$. We have $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} L(\\gamma_{\\epsilon}) = 2$. This shows that $d(p,q) \\le 2$. Since any curve in $M$ is also a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, its length must be at least the straight-line distance in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is $2$. Thus, $d(p,q) = 2$.\nThe sequence $\\{\\gamma_{\\epsilon}\\}_{\\epsilon>0}$ is therefore a minimizing sequence.\n\nThe failure to attain this minimum length of $2$ demonstrates a failure of compactness. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the sequence of curves $\\{\\gamma_{\\epsilon}\\}$ converges (in the $C^0$ topology, for instance) to a limit curve $\\gamma_0$. This limit curve is the straight line segment along the x-axis from $(1,0)$ to $(-1,0)$. The limit curve $\\gamma_0$ is not an element of the space of admissible curves, as it passes through the origin $(0,0) \\notin M$. The set of admissible curves (piecewise smooth curves in $M$ from $p$ to $q$) is not closed. A minimizing sequence in this set has a limit that lies outside the set. This is a characteristic failure of compactness: if the set of admissible curves (below a certain length) were compact, the length functional (which is continuous) would attain its minimum, and the limit of any minimizing sequence would have to be in the set.\n\n3) We wish to compute the Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$ in $M$, where $p=(1,0)$ and $q=(-1,0)$. The distance $d(p,q)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves in $M$ that connect $p$ and $q$.\nLet $\\gamma: [a,b] \\to M$ be any such curve. Since $M$ is a submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and its metric $g$ is the metric induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the length of $\\gamma$ as a curve in $(M,g)$ is identical to its length as a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the distance between any two points is the length of the straight line segment connecting them. For any curve $\\gamma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ from $p$ to $q$, its length $L(\\gamma)$ satisfies $L(\\gamma) \\ge d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(p,q)$. The Euclidean distance between $p=(1,0)$ and $q=(-1,0)$ is:\n$$d_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(p,q) = \\sqrt{(-1-1)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2} = 2$$\nTherefore, for any curve $\\gamma$ in $M$ from $p$ to $q$, we have $L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$. This implies that the Riemannian distance in $M$ is bounded below by $2$:\n$$d(p,q) = \\inf_{\\gamma \\subset M} L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$$\nTo show that this infimum is exactly $2$, we must construct a sequence of curves $\\{\\gamma_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $M$ from $p$ to $q$ such that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} L(\\gamma_n) = 2$. The sequence $\\{\\gamma_{\\epsilon}\\}_{\\epsilon>0}$ constructed in part (2) serves this purpose. For $\\epsilon = 1/n$ with $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we have a sequence of curves $\\gamma_n = \\gamma_{1/n}$ with lengths:\n$$L(\\gamma_n) = 2 + (\\pi - 2)\\frac{1}{n}$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the length approaches $2$:\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} L(\\gamma_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(2 + \\frac{\\pi - 2}{n}\\right) = 2$$\nSince we have established a lower bound of $2$ for the distance and found a sequence of path lengths converging to $2$, we conclude that the infimum is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2972373"}, {"introduction": "Our previous examples featured manifolds that were incomplete because they were \"missing\" points from a larger, complete ambient space.

Construction of the Geodesic\nA geodesic is a curve whose velocity vector is parallel transported along itself. This is expressed by the geodesic equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. For a $1$-dimensional manifold with coordinate $r(t)$, this equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}r}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}} + \\Gamma^{1}_{11} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)^{2} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\Gamma^{1}_{11}$ is the relevant Christoffel symbol of the second kind. The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the metric components using the formula:\n$$ \\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left(\\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^{l}}\\right) $$\nIn our case, there is only one coordinate $x^{1} = r$. The metric tensor has one component $g_{11} = g_{rr} = r^{-4}$. The inverse metric component is $g^{11} = g^{rr} = (g_{rr})^{-1} = r^{4}$. The Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^{1}_{11}$ is:\n$$ \\Gamma^{1}_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} $$\nThe derivative of the metric component is:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g_{11}}{\\mathrm{d}r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r}(r^{-4}) = -4 r^{-5} $$\nSubstituting this into the formula for $\\Gamma^{1}_{11}$:\n$$ \\Gamma^{1}_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} (r^{4})(-4 r^{-5}) = -2 r^{-1} = -\\frac{2}{r} $$\nThus, the geodesic equation is:\n$$ \\ddot{r} - \\frac{2}{r}\\dot{r}^{2} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\dot{r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ and $\\ddot{r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}r}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}}$.\n\nNext, we impose the unit-speed condition. The squared speed of the curve $r(t)$ is given by $v^{2} = g_{rr}(\\dot{r})^{2}$. For a unit-speed geodesic, $v^{2}=1$:\n$$ r^{-4} \\dot{r}^{2} = 1 $$\nThis implies $\\dot{r}^{2} = r^{4}$, and therefore $\\dot{r} = \\pm r^{2}$. The problem states that the initial velocity points toward increasing $r$, which means $\\dot{r}(0) > 0$. Evaluating at $t=0$, we have $\\dot{r}(0) = \\pm r(0)^{2} = \\pm r_{0}^{2}$. Since $r_{0} > 1$, $r_{0}^{2}$ is positive. To satisfy $\\dot{r}(0) > 0$, we must choose the positive sign. Thus, the velocity of the geodesic is governed by the first-order differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t} = r^{2} $$\nThis equation must hold for all $t$ for which the geodesic is defined, as the speed of a geodesic is constant. We can verify that any solution to $\\dot{r} = r^{2}$ satisfies the geodesic equation.

Demonstration of Geodesic Incompleteness\nThe geodesic $r(t) = \\frac{r_{0}}{1 - r_{0}t}$ is defined for $t \\ge 0$. The expression for $r(t)$ has a singularity when the denominator is zero, which occurs at $t = \\frac{1}{r_{0}}$. Since $r_{0} > 1$, this is a finite positive time.\n\nAs $t$ approaches this value from below, $t \\to (\\frac{1}{r_{0}})^{-}$, the denominator $1 - r_{0}t$ approaches $0$ from the positive side. Since the numerator $r_{0}$ is positive, we have:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to (1/r_{0})^{-}} r(t) = +\\infty $$\nThis shows that the particle traveling along the geodesic \"escapes to infinity\" in the finite parameter time $T = \\frac{1}{r_{0}}$.\n\nAny compact subset $K$ of $M = (1, \\infty)$ is bounded, meaning there exists a real number $B > 1$ such that for all $p \\in K$, $p \\le B$. Since $r(t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to T$, for any such $B$, there exists a time $t_{B} < T$ such that for all $t \\in (t_{B}, T)$, $r(t) > B$. This means the geodesic leaves the set $K$ and does not return. Therefore, the geodesic leaves every compact subset of $M$.\n\nA Riemannian manifold is defined as geodesically complete if every geodesic can be extended for all time, i.e., its parameter domain can be taken to be $\\mathbb{R}$. We have found a geodesic that is defined only on a finite time interval $[0, \\frac{1}{r_{0}})$. The existence of such a maximally defined geodesic over a finite parameter interval demonstrates that the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete.\n\nThe finite escape time $T$ is the supremum of the parameter values $t \\ge 0$ for which the geodesic $r(t)$ remains in $M$. The domain of definition for the geodesic starting at $t=0$ is the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{r_{0}})$. The supremum of this interval is:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{r_{0}} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r_{0}}}$$", "id": "2972408"}]}
