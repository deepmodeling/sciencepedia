Solving this system shows that the geodesics are straight lines, as expected for the Euclidean plane.\n\n**3. Riemannian Distance**\n\nThe Riemannian distance between two points $P_{1}$ at $(r_{1}, \\theta_{1})$ and $P_{2}$ at $(r_{2}, \\theta_{2})$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting them. This infimum is achieved by the length of the geodesic connecting the points.\n$$\nd(P_{1}, P_{2}) = L(\\gamma_{\\text{geodesic}}) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g}\\,dt = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dr}{dt}\\right)^{2} + r^{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right)^{2}} \\,dt\n$$\nSince the metric is the standard Euclidean metric expressed in polar coordinates, the geodesics are straight lines in the plane. The problem of finding the Riemannian distance is therefore equivalent to finding the length of the straight-line segment connecting $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$. The most direct way to compute this is to use Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ corresponding to the polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ are:\n$$\nx = r\\cos\\theta, \\quad y = r\\sin\\theta\n$$\nThe two points $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ have Cartesian coordinates:\n$$\n(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (r_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}, r_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1})\n$$\n$$\n(x_{2}, y_{2}) = (r_{2}\\cos\\theta_{2}, r_{2}\\sin\\theta_{2})\n$$\nThe standard Euclidean distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is $d = \\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2} + (y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$.

It presents a standard example illustrating the concepts of Riemannian distance, length-minimizing curves, and completeness.\n\n**1) Computation of the Riemannian distance $d_{M}(p,q)$**\n\nThe manifold $M$ is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the origin removed, $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. The Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is the standard Euclidean metric $g = dx^{2} + dy^{2}$, which is the metric induced by the inclusion of $M$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The specified points are $p = (-1,0)$ and $q = (1,0)$.\n\nThe length of any piecewise smooth curve $\\gamma$ in $M$ is calculated using the same formula as its length in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, since the metric is the same. In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the shortest distance between any two points is the Euclidean distance, achieved by the straight line segment connecting them. For $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$, the Euclidean distance is:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}(p,q) = \\|q - p\\| = \\|(1 - (-1), 0 - 0)\\| = \\|(2,0)\\| = 2\n$$\nAny curve $\\gamma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ connecting $p$ and $q$ has a length $L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$. Since every curve in $M$ is also a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the length of any curve in $M$ from $p$ to $q$ must also be at least $2$. This implies that the infimum of these lengths, which is the Riemannian distance $d_{M}(p,q)$, must be bounded below by $2$:\n$$\nd_{M}(p,q) = \\inf\\{L(\\gamma) : \\gamma \\text{ connects } p,q \\text{ in } M\\} \\ge 2\n$$\nTo show that this infimum is exactly $2$, we must construct a sequence of curves in $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$ whose lengths approach $2$. For any real number $\\epsilon > 0$, consider the piecewise smooth curve $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}$ that consists of two straight line segments: one from $p=(-1,0)$ to the point $(0,\\epsilon)$, and the second from $(0,\\epsilon)$ to $q=(1,0)$. For any $\\epsilon \\neq 0$, this path avoids the origin $(0,0)$ and is therefore a valid curve in $M$.\n\nThe length of $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}$ is the sum of the lengths of the two segments:\n$$\nL(\\gamma_{\\epsilon}) = \\sqrt{(0 - (-1))^{2} + (\\epsilon - 0)^{2}} + \\sqrt{(1 - 0)^{2} + (0 - \\epsilon)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nL(\\gamma_{\\epsilon}) = \\sqrt{1^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} + \\sqrt{1^{2} + (-\\epsilon)^{2}} = 2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^{2}}\n$$\nThe Riemannian distance $d_{M}(p,q)$ must be less than or equal to the length of any such curve in $M$:\n$$\nd_{M}(p,q) \\le L(\\gamma_{\\epsilon}) = 2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^{2}}\n$$\nThis inequality holds for all $\\epsilon > 0$. We can take the limit as $\\epsilon$ approaches $0$ from the right:\n$$\nd_{M}(p,q) \\le \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} 2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^{2}} = 2\\sqrt{1+0} = 2\n$$\nCombining the two inequalities $d_{M}(p,q) \\ge 2$ and $d_{M}(p,q) \\le 2$, we conclude that the Riemannian distance is exactly $2$.\n$$\nd_{M}(p,q) = 2\n$$\n\n**2) Proof of non-existence of a length-minimizing curve**\n\nWe proceed by contradiction. Assume there exists a piecewise smooth curve $\\gamma^{*}$ in $M$ that is length-minimizing, joining $p=(-1,0)$ to $q=(1,0)$. By definition, the length of this curve must be equal to the infimum distance, which we found in part (1).\n$$\nL(\\gamma^{*}) = d_{M}(p,q) = 2\n$$\nSince $\\gamma^{*}$ is a curve in $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, it is also a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the shortest path between $p$ and $q$ is the unique straight line segment connecting them. The length of this path is $d_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}(p,q) = 2$. Any other curve connecting these points has a length strictly greater than $2$.\n\nTherefore, for a curve $\\gamma^{*}$ to have length $L(\\gamma^{*}) = 2$, it must be precisely this straight line segment. This segment can be parameterized as $\\gamma_{0}(t) = (t,0)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$. However, this path includes the point $\\gamma_{0}(0) = (0,0)$.\n\nThe manifold $M$ is defined as $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. Since the point $(0,0)$ is not in $M$, the curve $\\gamma_{0}$ is not a curve in $M$. This contradicts our initial assumption that $\\gamma^{*}$ is a curve *in M*.\n\nThus, no such length-minimizing curve exists in $M$. The infimum distance $d_{M}(p,q) = 2$ is approached by sequences of curves in $M$, but it is never attained by any single curve that lies entirely within $M$.\n\n**3) Justification for non-completeness**\n\nA Riemannian manifold is called complete if it is complete as a metric space with respect to its Riemannian distance function $d_{M}$. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space converges to a limit point that is also in the space. We can show that $(M, d_{M})$ is not complete by constructing a Cauchy sequence in $M$ that does not converge to a point in $M$.\n\nConsider the sequence of points $\\{p_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $M$ defined by $p_{n} = (\\frac{1}{n}, 0)$. For each $n \\ge 1$, $p_n \\in M$ since $\\frac{1}{n} \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's check if this sequence is a Cauchy sequence. For any positive integers $m, n$, the distance $d_{M}(p_{n}, p_{m})$ is the infimum of lengths of paths in $M$ between $p_{n}=(\\frac{1}{n}, 0)$ and $p_{m}=(\\frac{1}{m}, 0)$. Since these points lie on the positive x-axis, the straight line segment between them also lies on the positive x-axis and does not pass through the origin. This segment is therefore a curve in $M$, and it is the shortest possible curve. Thus, the Riemannian distance equals the Euclidean distance:\n$$\nd_{M}(p_{n}, p_{m}) = d_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}(p_{n}, p_{m}) = \\left\\| \\left(\\frac{1}{m}, 0\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{n}, 0\\right) \\right\\| = \\left| \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} \\right|\n$$\nAs $n, m \\to \\infty$, this distance approaches $0$. Therefore, $\\{p_{n}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(M, d_{M})$.\n\nIn the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, this sequence converges to the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} p_{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}, 0\\right) = (0,0)\n$$\nHowever, the limit point $(0,0)$ is precisely the point excluded from $M$. Thus, the Cauchy sequence $\\{p_{n}\\}$ does not converge to a point within $M$. This demonstrates that the metric space $(M, d_{M})$ is not complete.\n\nThe Hopf-Rinow theorem states that a Riemannian manifold is complete if and only if for any two points, there exists a length-minimizing geodesic connecting them. Our manifold $M$ provides a counterexample to the implication for non-complete spaces. We have shown that $M$ is not complete, and in part (2), we showed that there exist points $p=(-1,0)$ and $q=(1,0)$ that cannot be joined by a length-minimizing curve.

For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$, the Jacobi equation for a Jacobi field $J(t)$ that is orthogonal to the geodesic velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$ simplifies to the second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$J''(t) + \\kappa J(t) = 0.$$\nHere, differentiation is with respect to the arc-length parameter $t$, and the equation is understood to hold for the components of $J(t)$ in a parallel-transported orthonormal frame along $\\gamma$.\n\nA point $\\gamma(t_c)$ is conjugate to $p=\\gamma(0)$ if there exists a non-zero Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(t_c) = 0$. Such a field arises from a variation of geodesics starting at $p$. The condition $J(0)=0$ is always met for such fields. The scalar components $f_i(t)$ of $J(t)$ in a parallel frame must satisfy $f_i'' + \\kappa f_i = 0$. The general solution is $f_i(t) = A_i \\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t) + B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)$. The condition $f_i(0)=0$ implies $A_i=0$, so any such Jacobi field component must be of the form $f_i(t) = B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t)$.\nFor the Jacobi field to be non-zero, at least one $B_i$ must be non-zero. The condition $J(t_c)=0$ then requires $f_i(t_c)=0$ for all $i$, which implies $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} t_c) = 0$.\nThe non-zero solutions for $t_c > 0$ are given by $\\sqrt{\\kappa} t_c = k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\geq 1$. The first conjugate point along any geodesic occurs at the distance $t_c$ corresponding to $k=1$:\n$$t_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}.$$\nThis result is independent of the initial direction of the geodesic. Therefore, for our sphere $(S^n, g_\\kappa)$, the first conjugate point to $p$ along any geodesic occurs at a distance of $\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\n\nGeometrically, on a sphere of radius $R=1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, all geodesics (great circles) emanating from a point $p$ (the north pole) reconverge at a single point, the antipodal point $p_{\\text{anti}}$ (the south pole). The distance along any great circle from $p$ to $p_{\\text{anti}}$ is half the circumference, which is $\\pi R = \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. This is a perfect example of geodesic focusing. The exponential map takes the entire sphere of radius $\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ in the tangent space $T_pS^n$ and maps it to the single point $p_{\\text{anti}}$. Consequently, the differential $d(\\exp_p)_v$ for any vector $v$ with norm $\\|v\\|_{g_\\kappa} = \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ is the zero map, which is maximally singular. This focusing causes the breakdown of smoothness of the distance function $d_p(\\cdot)$ at the point $p_{\\text{anti}}$, as the gradient of the distance function, $\\nabla d_p$, which points along the unique minimizing geodesic from $p$, is not well-defined at $p_{\\text{anti}}$ due to the infinite number of such geodesics.\n\n**Part 2: The Cut Locus and the Hopf-Rinow Theorem**\n\nThe cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$ of a point $p$ in a complete Riemannian manifold is the set of points $q$ at which minimizing geodesics from $p$ cease to be unique. By the Hopf-Rinow Theorem (HRT), the manifold $(S^n, g_\\kappa)$ is complete (as stated in the problem), and for any two points, there exists a length-minimizing geodesic connecting them.\n\nLet's identify the cut locus of $p$.\nFor any point $q \\in S^n$ that is not the antipodal point $p_{\\text{anti}}$, there exists a unique shortest great circle arc connecting $p$ and $q$. The length of this arc is $d_p(q)  \\pi R = \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\nHowever, for the specific point $q = p_{\\text{anti}}$, there are infinitely many geodesics from $p$ to $q$. All great circles passing through $p$ also pass through $p_{\\text{anti}}$, and the segment from $p$ to $p_{\\text{anti}}$ along any of them has the same length, $\\pi R = \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. Since these are the shortest paths, we have a massive non-uniqueness of minimizing geodesics.\nBased on the definition, this means the antipodal point $p_{\\text{anti}}$ is in the cut locus. Since for any other point uniqueness holds, the cut locus consists of just this single point:\n$$\\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{p_{\\text{anti}}\\}.$$\nThe HRT guarantees the existence of minimizing geodesics, which is the foundational property used in the definition of the cut locus. Our analysis confirms that for the sphere, the cut locus of a point is precisely its antipodal point. We also observe that the cut point coincides with the first conjugate point along every geodesic from $p$. A geodesic on the sphere ceases to be globally length-minimizing precisely when it reaches the antipodal point.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Geodesic Radius $r_\\ast$**\n\nThe problem asks for the geodesic radius $r_\\ast$ at which $d_{g_\\kappa}(p, \\cdot)$ first fails to be smooth due to geodesic focusing. As established, the non-smoothness of the distance function occurs on the cut locus. The geodesic focusing (formation of conjugate points) provides the underlying mechanism for the formation of the cut locus in this case.\n\nThe radius $r_\\ast$ is the minimum distance from $p$ to a point in its cut locus. Mathematically,\n$$r_\\ast = \\inf_{q \\in \\operatorname{Cut}(p)} d_{g_\\kappa}(p, q).$$\nFrom Part 2, we identified the cut locus as a single point, $\\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{p_{\\text{anti}}\\}$. Therefore, the infimum is simply the distance to this single point:\n$$r_\\ast = d_{g_\\kappa}(p, p_{\\text{anti}}).$$\nThis distance is the length of a minimal geodesic connecting $p$ to its antipode, which is half the circumference of a great circle on the sphere of radius $R = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\n$$r_\\ast = \\pi R = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}.$$\nThis is the distance at which the geodesics emanating from $p$ first reconverge, causing the distance function to lose smoothness. For any radius $r  r_\\ast$, the geodesic sphere $\\{q \\in S^n \\mid d_p(q) = r\\}$ is a smooth $(n-1)$-dimensional sphere. At $r=r_\\ast$, this \"sphere\" degenerates to a single point, $p_{\\text{anti}}$. This corresponds exactly to the first vanishing of the Jacobi fields that start at $p$, confirming that $r_\\ast$ is the distance to the first conjugate points.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}}$$", "id": "2984258"}]}
