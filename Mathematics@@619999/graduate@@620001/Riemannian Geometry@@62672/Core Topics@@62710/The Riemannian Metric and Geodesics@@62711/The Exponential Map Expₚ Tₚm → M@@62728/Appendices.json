Thus, the first conjugate point to $p$ along any geodesic is the antipodal point $-p$.\n\nNext, we identify the cut locus, $\\text{Cut}(p)$. On $S^n$, for any point $q \\in S^n$ that is not the antipodal point of $p$ (i.e., $q \\neq -p$), there is a unique shortest geodesic connecting $p$ to $q$. However, for the antipodal point $q=-p$, there are infinitely many minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$, namely all the semicircles of great circles passing through $p$ and $-p$. The length of each of these geodesics is $\\pi$. Thus, the cut locus of $p$ is precisely the singleton set containing the antipodal point: $\\text{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$.\n\nThe injectivity radius at $p$ is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, \\text{Cut}(p)) = d(p, -p) $$\nAs established, the distance on the unit sphere between a point and its antipode is the length of a minimal geodesic path, which is $\\pi$.\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\pi $$\nThis value is the same as the distance to the first conjugate point, as expected for a symmetric space like the sphere. Because the sphere is a homogeneous space (the group of isometries $O(n+1)$ acts transitively), the geometry is the same at every point. Thus, the injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ is independent of the choice of $p \\in S^n$.\n\nThe value, expressed as an exact real number in radians, is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "2995703"}]}
