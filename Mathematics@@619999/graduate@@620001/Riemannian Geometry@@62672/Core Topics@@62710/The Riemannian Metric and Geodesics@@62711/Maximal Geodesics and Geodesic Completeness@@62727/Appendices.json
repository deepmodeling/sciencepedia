The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of Riemannian geometry, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution.\n\nThe Riemannian manifold is $(M,g)$, where $M$ is the open strip in the Euclidean plane defined by $M = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : 0 < x < 1\\}$, and the metric $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric $dx^{2}+dy^{2}$ restricted to $M$. Since $M$ is an open submanifold of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, its Levi-Civita connection is the restriction of the flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Consequently, the geodesics of $(M,g)$ are segments of straight lines, as given by the general solution $\\gamma(t) = p + tv$, for as long as the path remains inside $M$.\n\n**Task 1: Metric Incompleteness**\n\nTo show that $(M,g)$ is not metrically complete, we must construct a Cauchy sequence of points in $M$ that does not converge to a point within $M$. Let us consider the sequence of points $\\{p_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $M$ defined by $p_{n} = (\\frac{1}{n+2}, 0)$. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, the $x$-coordinate $x_{n} = \\frac{1}{n+2}$ satisfies $0 < \\frac{1}{n+2} < 1$, so each point $p_{n}$ is indeed in $M$.\n\nNext, we show that $\\{p_{n}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence. The distance between two points $p_{n}$ and $p_{m}$ in $(M,g)$ is the Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$d(p_{n}, p_{m}) = \\|p_{n} - p_{m}\\| = \\left\\| \\left(\\frac{1}{n+2}, 0\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{m+2}, 0\\right) \\right\\| = \\left| \\frac{1}{n+2} - \\frac{1}{m+2} \\right|$$\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, we need to find an integer $N$ such that for all $n,m > N$, $d(p_{n}, p_{m}) < \\epsilon$.\nUsing the triangle inequality, for $n,m > N$:\n$$d(p_{n}, p_{m}) \\le \\left| \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right| + \\left| \\frac{1}{m+2} \\right| = \\frac{1}{n+2} + \\frac{1}{m+2} < \\frac{1}{N+2} + \\frac{1}{N+2} = \\frac{2}{N+2}$$\nWe can ensure $\\frac{2}{N+2} < \\epsilon$ by choosing $N$ such that $N+2 > \\frac{2}{\\epsilon}$, or $N > \\frac{2}{\\epsilon} - 2$. Such an integer $N$ exists for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Thus, $\\{p_{n}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence.\n\nNow, we examine the convergence of this sequence. In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the sequence converges to:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} p_{n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{n+2}, 0\\right) = (0, 0)$$\nThe limit point $p_{\\infty} = (0,0)$ has an $x$-coordinate of $0$, which does not satisfy the condition $0 < x < 1$ for membership in $M$. Therefore, the limit point is not in $M$. Since a convergent sequence in a metric space has a unique limit, and the limit of $\\{p_{n}\\}$ in the larger space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not in $M$, the sequence cannot converge to any point within $M$. This demonstrates that $(M,g)$ is not a metrically complete space.\n\n**Task 2: Geodesic Incompleteness**\n\nA Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if every maximal geodesic can be defined for all parameter values $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The geodesics in $(M,g)$ are straight lines. Let's consider a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at a point $p=(x_{0}, y_{0}) \\in M$ with a non-zero velocity component in the $x$-direction, $v=(v_{x}, v_{y})$ with $v_{x} \\neq 0$. The path is given by $\\gamma(t) = (x_{0}+tv_{x}, y_{0}+tv_{y})$.\n\nFor this path to remain in $M$, its $x$-coordinate must satisfy $0 < x_{0}+tv_{x} < 1$.\nIf $v_{x} > 0$, the geodesic moves towards the boundary line $x=1$. The condition $x_{0}+tv_{x} < 1$ implies $tv_{x} < 1-x_{0}$, or $t < \\frac{1-x_{0}}{v_{x}}$. The geodesic exits $M$ at the finite positive time $t = \\frac{1-x_{0}}{v_{x}}$.\nIf $v_{x} < 0$, the geodesic moves towards the boundary line $x=0$. The condition $x_{0}+tv_{x} > 0$ implies $tv_{x} > -x_{0}$. Since $v_{x}$ is negative, dividing by it reverses the inequality: $t < \\frac{-x_{0}}{v_{x}} = \\frac{x_{0}}{|v_{x}|}$. The geodesic exits $M$ at the finite positive time $t=\\frac{x_{0}}{|v_{x}|}$.\n\nIn either case, if $v_{x} \\neq 0$, the geodesic cannot be extended for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its maximal domain of definition is a finite open interval, not $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. This failure of at least one geodesic to be defined for all real parameter values means that $(M,g)$ is not geodesically complete. This is consistent with the Hopf-Rinow theorem, which states that geodesic completeness is equivalent to metric completeness for a connected Riemannian manifold. Since we found $(M,g)$ to be metrically incomplete, it must also be geodesically incomplete.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Forward Endpoint $t_{+}$**\n\nWe are given a point $p=(x_{0},y_{0}) \\in M$, which means $0 < x_{0} < 1$. We are also given an initial velocity $v=(v_{x},v_{y})$ such that $|v|=\\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}}=1$ and $v_{x}>0$. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p$ with velocity $v$ is given by:\n$$\\gamma(t) = p + tv = (x_{0}, y_{0}) + t(v_{x}, v_{y}) = (x_{0} + tv_{x}, y_{0} + tv_{y})$$\nThis is a unit-speed geodesic. We seek the forward endpoint $t_{+}$ of the maximal open interval of definition $(t_{-}, t_{+})$. This is the largest positive time for which the geodesic remains in $M$. The condition for $\\gamma(t) \\in M$ is $0 < x(t) < 1$, where $x(t) = x_{0} + tv_{x}$. The $y$-coordinate $y(t) = y_{0}+tv_{y}$ is not restricted.\n\nWe must satisfy the two inequalities for $t > 0$:\n1. $x_{0} + tv_{x} > 0$\n2. $x_{0} + tv_{x} < 1$\n\nLet's analyze the first inequality. We are given $x_{0}>0$ and $v_{x}>0$. For any $t > 0$, the term $tv_{x}$ is positive. Therefore, $x_{0} + tv_{x}$ is also positive, and this inequality is always satisfied for $t>0$.\n\nNow let's analyze the second inequality, which imposes the actual constraint:\n$$x_{0} + tv_{x} < 1$$\nWe can solve for $t$:\n$$tv_{x} < 1 - x_{0}$$\nSince we are given $v_{x} > 0$, we can divide by $v_{x}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$t < \\frac{1 - x_{0}}{v_{x}}$$\nThis inequality gives the upper bound on the parameter $t$ for which the geodesic stays within $M$. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is defined on the interval $[0, T)$ for any $T \\le \\frac{1 - x_{0}}{v_{x}}$. The maximal such interval for positive time extends up to, but does not include, the point where the path hits the boundary. The supremum of all such $t$ values is the forward endpoint $t_{+}$.\nTherefore, the forward endpoint of the maximal interval is:\n$$t_{+} = \\frac{1 - x_{0}}{v_{x}}$$\nFor completeness, the backward endpoint $t_{-}$ would be found by considering $t<0$. The condition $x_0 + tv_x > 0$ with $v_x > 0$ gives $tv_x > -x_0$, so $t > -x_0/v_x$. Thus $t_{-} = -x_0/v_x$. The full maximal interval is $(-\\frac{x_0}{v_x}, \\frac{1-x_0}{v_x})$. The problem only asks for $t_{+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1-x_{0}}{v_{x}}}$$", "id": "2983402"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how removing points can lead to incompleteness, we now explore how a metric can be \"engineered\" to repair such a deficiency.

Conjugate points along a geodesic correspond to zeros of nontrivial Jacobi fields orthogonal to the geodesic and form an obstruction to local diffeomorphicity of $\\exp_{p}$.\n\nAnalysis on $S^{n}_{r}$:\n- The round sphere $S^{n}_{r}$ has constant sectional curvature $K=1/r^{2}$. Geodesics are great circles parametrized by arc length; for an initial tangent vector $v\\in T_{p}S^{n}_{r}$ with $|v|=1$, the geodesic $\\gamma$ satisfies $|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|=1$ and lies on a totally geodesic $S^{1}$.\n- The Jacobi field equation along $\\gamma$ for a normal Jacobi field $J$ is\n$$\n\\frac{D^{2}J}{dt^{2}} + R(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0.\n$$\nIn a space of constant curvature $K$, for $J$ orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, this reduces to\n$$\n\\frac{D^{2}J}{dt^{2}} + K\\,J = 0.\n$$\nOn $S^{n}_{r}$, $K=1/r^{2}$, so $J$ satisfies $J'' + \\frac{1}{r^{2}} J = 0$ when restricted to an appropriate parallel frame along $\\gamma$.

In addition, uniqueness of minimizing geodesics from $p$ persists up to, but not beyond, the antipodal point. On the sphere, the antipodal point $-p$ is reached by all unit-speed geodesics at parameter length $\\pi r$. For $t<\\pi r$, the exponential map is injective and distance-minimizing geodesics are unique. At $t=\\pi r$, there are infinitely many distinct geodesics from $p$ to $-p$ of equal length $\\pi r$, so $-p$ lies in $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$, and for $t>\\pi r$ the geodesics cease to minimize (they wrap past the antipode).\n- Therefore, on $S^{n}_{r}$, we have $\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$, the antipodal point, and $\\mathrm{inj}(p) = \\pi r$.\n\nGeodesic completeness on $S^{n}_{r}$:\n- The geodesic equation on a compact manifold with smooth metric has globally existing solutions for all times due to standard existence and uniqueness results for ordinary differential equations and bounded geometry; in fact, $S^{n}_{r}$ is geodesically complete (every geodesic extends to all $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$). Hopf–Rinow theorem then implies metric completeness and the existence of minimizing geodesics between any two points. In our computation, the fact that one can parametrize great circles for all time shows completeness directly.\n\nAnalysis on the flat cylinder $C_{R} = S^{1}_{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$:\n- Consider the universal cover $\\pi\\colon \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to C_{R}$, given by $\\pi(x,y) = (\\theta,y)$ with $\\theta = x/R$ modulo $2\\pi$. The metric lifts to the Euclidean metric $dx^{2} + dy^{2}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Geodesics on $C_{R}$ lift to straight lines on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n- There are no conjugate points in flat Euclidean space, and thus none in $C_{R}$: the curvature tensor vanishes, so the Jacobi equation reduces to $J''=0$ and nontrivial Jacobi fields do not develop zeros after $t=0$ unless they are linear combinations that vanish identically; hence $\\exp_{p}$ is locally diffeomorphic for all radii in the universal cover.\n- Cut points in $C_{R}$ arise from the nontrivial topology: since $x$ is periodic with period $2\\pi R$, a point $q=\\pi(\\tilde{q})$ has an infinite family of lifts $\\tilde{q}_{k} = \\tilde{q} + (2\\pi R k, 0)$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. The distance from a lift $\\tilde{p}$ of $p$ to $\\tilde{q}_{k}$ is $\\sqrt{(x_{q}-x_{p}+2\\pi R k)^{2} + (y_{q}-y_{p})^{2}}$. Minimizing over $k$ yields a unique minimizing lift unless the horizontal separation $x_{q}-x_{p}$ is congruent to $\\pi R$ modulo $2\\pi R$, in which case two lifts tie: the integers $k$ and $k-1$ are equidistant from $-(x_{q}-x_{p})/(2\\pi R) = -1/2$ in that case. Therefore, the cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ is the entire vertical geodesic through the point opposite to $p$ in the $S^{1}_{R}$-factor:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\{\\,(\\theta_{p}+\\pi \\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ 2\\pi,\\ y)\\ :\\ y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\}.\n$$\n- The injectivity radius $\\mathrm{inj}(p)$ is the largest radius for which no two distinct geodesics from $p$ minimize to the same endpoint. Along the circle direction, uniqueness holds up to half the circumference, which is $\\pi R$. Along the $\\mathbb{R}$ direction there is no obstruction. Hence $\\mathrm{inj}(p) = \\pi R$.\n\nGeodesic completeness on $C_{R}$:\n- Since $C_{R}$ is a quotient of the complete flat plane by a free, properly discontinuous isometric action of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in one direction, solutions to the geodesic equation lift to globally defined straight lines on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and project to globally defined geodesics on $C_{R}$. Thus every geodesic extends for all parameter times, establishing geodesic completeness. By Hopf–Rinow, $C_{R}$ is metrically complete and has minimizing geodesics between any two points; the cut locus reflects nonuniqueness at the opposite generator, not a failure of completeness.\n\nCollecting the injectivity radii, we obtain the single closed-form expression for the pair\n$$\n\\big(\\mathrm{inj}_{S^{n}_{r}}(p),\\ \\mathrm{inj}_{C_{R}}(p)\\big) = \\big(\\pi r,\\ \\pi R\\big).\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\\pi r & \\pi R\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2983363"}]}
