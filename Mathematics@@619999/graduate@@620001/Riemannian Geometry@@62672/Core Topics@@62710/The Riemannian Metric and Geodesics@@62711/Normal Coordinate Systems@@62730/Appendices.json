A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution will proceed by sequentially addressing the tasks outlined in the problem.\n\n**1. Explicit Formula for the Exponential Map**\n\nLet $p \\in S^n_R \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We can view $p$ as a vector from the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ satisfying $\\|p\\|=R$. The tangent space $T_p S^n_R$ is the hyperplane through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ orthogonal to $p$. A tangent vector $v \\in T_p S^n_R$ satisfies $\\langle v, p \\rangle = 0$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the Euclidean inner product.\n\nA geodesic on $S^n_R$ is a great circle. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v$ (i.e., $\\gamma(0)=p$, $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=v$) is the great circle in the two-dimensional plane spanned by $p$ and $v$. The speed of this geodesic is constant and equal to $\\|v\\|$. The parameter $t$ for the exponential map corresponds to traveling for time $t=1$. The length of the arc traversed is $s = \\|v\\| \\times 1 = \\|v\\|$.\n\nThe angle subtended by this arc at the center of the sphere is $\\theta = s/R = \\|v\\|/R$. The point $\\exp_p(v)$ is obtained by rotating $p$ by this angle $\\theta$ in the plane spanned by $p$ and $v$, towards $v$. The vectors $p/R$ and $v/\\|v\\|$ form an orthonormal basis for this plane. The formula for rotation is thus:\n$$ \\exp_p(v) = R \\left( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\|v\\|}{R}\\right) \\frac{p}{R} + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\|v\\|}{R}\\right) \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|} \\right) $$\n$$ \\exp_p(v) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\|v\\|}{R}\\right) p + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\|v\\|}{R}\\right) \\frac{R}{\\|v\\|} v $$\nNormal coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ are defined by the relation $v = \\sum_{i=1}^n x^i e_i$. Let $r = \\|v\\| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x^i)^2}$. The coordinate chart $\\phi: U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n \\to S^n_R$ is given by mapping $x=(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ to the point $q(x) = \\exp_p(\\sum_i x^i e_i)$:\n$$ q(x) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)p + \\frac{R\\sin(r/R)}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^n x^i e_i $$\nThis is the explicit construction of the normal coordinate chart.\n\nTo proceed logically and fulfill all parts of the prompt, we will first compute the curvature tensor using the Gauss equation (Part 3), and then use this result to verify the Taylor expansion of the metric (Part 2).\n\n**3. Riemann Curvature Tensor from the Gauss Equation**\n\nThe Gauss equation for a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ relates its intrinsic curvature (Riemann tensor $R$) to its extrinsic curvature (second fundamental form $h$). The equation for the curvature operator is:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = h(Y,Z)S(X) - h(X,Z)S(Y) $$\nwhere $X, Y, Z$ are tangent vector fields and $S$ is the shape operator. The shape operator $S(X)$ is given by the Weingarten equation $D_X N = -S(X)$, where $N$ is the unit normal vector field and $D$ is the flat covariant derivative in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nFor the sphere $S^n_R$, we can choose the outward unit normal $N(q) = q/R$ for $q \\in S^n_R$. Let $X_p \\in T_pS^n_R$. We compute the derivative of $N$ in the direction $X_p$:\n$$ D_{X_p} N = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{N(p+tX_p) - N(p)}{t} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\frac{\\gamma(t)}{R} $$\nwhere $\\gamma(t)$ is any curve on $S^n_R$ with $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=X_p$. So, $D_{X_p} N = \\dot{\\gamma}(0)/R = X_p/R$.\nThe shape operator is then $S(X_p) = -D_{X_p} N = -X_p/R$.\n\nThe (scalar) second fundamental form is $h(X,Y) = g(S(X),Y)$. At any point $p \\in S^n_R$:\n$$ h(X_p, Y_p) = g(S(X_p), Y_p) = g(-X_p/R, Y_p) = -\\frac{1}{R}g(X_p, Y_p) $$\nSubstituting $S$ and $h$ into the Gauss equation:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = \\left(-\\frac{1}{R}g(Y,Z)\\right)\\left(-\\frac{X}{R}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{R}g(X,Z)\\right)\\left(-\\frac{Y}{R}\\right) $$\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = \\frac{1}{R^2}g(Y,Z)X - \\frac{1}{R^2}g(X,Z)Y $$\nThis is the standard expression for a manifold of constant sectional curvature $1/R^2$.\n\nWe now compute the components $R_{ikjl}(p)$ in the orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}$. The problem specifies the convention $R_{ikjl} = g(R(e_i, e_k)e_l, e_j)$.\n$$ R(e_i, e_k)e_l = \\frac{1}{R^2}( g(e_k, e_l)e_i - g(e_i, e_l)e_k ) = \\frac{1}{R^2}( \\delta_{kl}e_i - \\delta_{il}e_k ) $$\nTaking the inner product with $e_j$:\n$$ R_{ikjl}(p) = g\\left( \\frac{1}{R^2}( \\delta_{kl}e_i - \\delta_{il}e_k ), e_j \\right) = \\frac{1}{R^2}( \\delta_{kl} g(e_i, e_j) - \\delta_{il} g(e_k, e_j) ) $$\n$$ R_{ikjl}(p) = \\frac{1}{R^2}(\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj}) $$\nThis verifies that the Riemann tensor has the form $R_{ikjl}=\\kappa(\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl}-\\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj})$, with the constant $\\kappa = 1/R^2$. Since $R>0$, we have $\\kappa>0$.\n\n**2. Taylor Expansion of the Metric**\n\nThe metric components $g_{ij}(x)$ in the normal coordinates $x=(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ are given by $g_{ij}(x) = \\langle \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x^j} \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}$. The line element $ds^2$ on a space of constant curvature $\\kappa$ in normal coordinates takes the form $ds^2 = dr^2 + \\frac{\\sin^2(\\sqrt{\\kappa}r)}{\\kappa} d\\Omega_{n-1}^2$. For our sphere, $\\kappa=1/R^2$, so $ds^2 = dr^2 + R^2 \\sin^2(r/R) d\\Omega_{n-1}^2$.\n\nThe Euclidean metric in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in spherical coordinates is $ds^2_{\\text{flat}} = dr^2 + r^2 d\\Omega_{n-1}^2$. The Cartesian basis $dx^i$ relates to this via $\\sum_i (dx^i)^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\\Omega_{n-1}^2$. So we can write $r^2 d\\Omega_{n-1}^2 = \\sum_{i,j}(\\delta_{ij} - \\frac{x^i x^j}{r^2})dx^i dx^j$.\nSubstituting this into the metric for the sphere:\n$$ ds^2 = \\frac{x^i x^j}{r^2}dx^i dx^j + \\frac{R^2\\sin^2(r/R)}{r^2} \\left( \\sum_{k,l}\\delta_{kl}dx^k dx^l - \\frac{x^k x^l}{r^2}dx^k dx^l \\right) $$\nFrom this, we identify the metric components $g_{ij}(x)$:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\frac{x^i x^j}{r^2} + \\frac{R^2\\sin^2(r/R)}{r^2} \\left( \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{x^i x^j}{r^2} \\right) $$\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\frac{R^2\\sin^2(r/R)}{r^2}\\delta_{ij} + \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2\\sin^2(r/R)}{r^2}\\right) \\frac{x^i x^j}{r^2} $$\nTo find the Taylor expansion, we expand the coefficients for small $r$. Let $u=r/R$.\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2(u)}{u^2} = \\frac{(u - u^3/6 + O(u^5))^2}{u^2} = \\frac{u^2 - u^4/3 + O(u^6)}{u^2} = 1 - \\frac{u^2}{3} + O(u^4) = 1 - \\frac{r^2}{3R^2} + O(r^4) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $g_{ij}(x)$:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{3R^2} + O(r^4)\\right)\\delta_{ij} + \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{3R^2} + O(r^4)\\right)\\right) \\frac{x^i x^j}{r^2} $$\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{r^2}{3R^2}\\delta_{ij} + \\left(\\frac{r^2}{3R^2} + O(r^4)\\right) \\frac{x^i x^j}{r^2} $$\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{\\sum_k (x^k)^2}{3R^2}\\delta_{ij} + \\frac{1}{3R^2}x^i x^j + O(|x|^4) $$\nThe quadratic part is $\\frac{1}{3R^2}(x^i x^j - \\delta_{ij} \\sum_k (x^k)^2)$.\n\nThe general theory of normal coordinates states that the metric expansion is related to the Riemann tensor by:\n$$ g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{k,l} R_{ikjl}(p)x^k x^l + \\text{higher order terms} $$\n(Note: this is a standard form where the coefficient of $x^k x^l$ is understood to be symmetrized over $k$ and $l$).\nLet's substitute the curvature tensor components we found in Part 3 into this theoretical formula.\n$R_{ikjl} = \\frac{1}{R^2}(\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj})$.\nThe quadratic term in the theoretical expansion is:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{k,l} \\frac{1}{R^2}(\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj}) x^k x^l = -\\frac{1}{3R^2} \\left( \\delta_{ij} \\sum_{k,l}\\delta_{kl}x^k x^l - \\sum_{k,l}\\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj}x^k x^l \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{3R^2} \\left( \\delta_{ij} \\sum_k (x^k)^2 - x^i x^j \\right) = \\frac{1}{3R^2} (x^i x^j - \\delta_{ij} \\sum_k (x^k)^2) $$\nThis matches exactly the quadratic term we derived directly from the coordinate chart. This confirms the consistency of the results. The quadratic part of the metric expansion has been expressed in terms of the pre-calculated Riemann tensor.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the constant $\\kappa$.\nFrom our calculation in Part 3, we have identified $\\kappa = 1/R^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{R^2}}$$", "id": "2985127"}, {"introduction": "Having constructed a normal coordinate system, it is natural to ask how it behaves under the manifold's symmetries.

Note that due to $g^{0k}=0$ for $k \\geq 1$, the sum over $\\lambda$ in the formula for $\\Gamma^0_{0i}$ only has a $\\lambda=0$ term.\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^0_{0i} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{0\\lambda} (\\partial_0 g_{i\\lambda} + \\partial_i g_{0\\lambda} - \\partial_\\lambda g_{0i}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_0 g_{i0} + \\partial_i g_{00} - \\partial_0 g_{0i})\n    $$\n    Since $g_{00} = 1$ and $g_{i0} = 0$, all the metric components inside the parenthesis are constant, and their derivatives are zero.\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^0_{0i} = \\frac{1}{2} (1) (\\partial_0(0) + \\partial_i(1) - \\partial_0(0)) = 0\n    $$\n    This holds everywhere in the coordinate patch, so $\\Gamma^0_{0i}(p) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Value of $\\Gamma^0_{ij}(p)$**:\n    Again, we use the Christoffel symbol formula, where only the $\\lambda=0$ term survives.\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^0_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{0\\lambda} (\\partial_i g_{j\\lambda} + \\partial_j g_{i\\lambda} - \\partial_\\lambda g_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_i g_{j0} + \\partial_j g_{i0} - \\partial_0 g_{ij})\n    $$\n    Using $g^{00}=1$ and $g_{j0}=g_{i0}=0$:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^0_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (1) (\\partial_i(0) + \\partial_j(0) - \\partial_0 g_{ij}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\partial_0 g_{ij}\n    $$\n    Now, we relate this to the second fundamental form, $\\mathrm{II}$. The problem defines it as $\\mathrm{II}(X, Y) = g(\\nabla_X n, Y)$ for tangential vector fields $X, Y$. At the boundary, the vector fields $\\partial_i$ are tangential and the outward unit normal is $n = \\partial_0$. Let us compute the components $\\mathrm{II}_{ij} = \\mathrm{II}(\\partial_i, \\partial_j)$ at $p$.\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{II}_{ij}(p) = g(\\nabla_{\\partial_i} \\partial_0, \\partial_j)|_p\n    $$\n    We first find the vector $\\nabla_{\\partial_i} \\partial_0 = \\Gamma^\\mu_{i0} \\partial_\\mu = \\Gamma^0_{i0} \\partial_0 + \\Gamma^k_{i0} \\partial_k$. We already know $\\Gamma^0_{i0} = \\Gamma^0_{0i} = 0$. Let's compute $\\Gamma^k_{i0}$:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^k_{i0} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{k\\lambda} (\\partial_i g_{0\\lambda} + \\partial_0 g_{i\\lambda} - \\partial_\\lambda g_{i0})\n    $$\n    Since $g^{k0}=0$, the sum is over $\\lambda=l \\in \\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$.\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^k_{i0} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{0l} + \\partial_0 g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{i0}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i(0) + \\partial_0 g_{il} - \\partial_l(0)) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\partial_0 g_{il}\n    $$\n    So, $\\nabla_{\\partial_i} \\partial_0 = (\\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\partial_0 g_{il}) \\partial_k$.\n    Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{II}_{ij}$:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{II}_{ij} = g\\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\partial_0 g_{il}\\right) \\partial_k, \\partial_j \\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\partial_0 g_{il}\\right) g_{kj}\n    $$\n    Using the property $g^{kl}g_{kj} = \\delta^l_j$:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{II}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta^l_j (\\partial_0 g_{il}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\partial_0 g_{ij}\n    $$\n    Comparing this result with our expression for $\\Gamma^0_{ij}$, we find at $p$:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^0_{ij}(p) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\partial_0 g_{ij}|_p = -\\mathrm{II}_{ij}(p)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Value of $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p)$**:\n    We compute the tangential Christoffel symbols. As $g^{k0}=0$, the sum over $\\lambda$ for $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ is restricted to tangential indices $l \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{k\\lambda} (\\partial_i g_{j\\lambda} + \\partial_j g_{i\\lambda} - \\partial_\\lambda g_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})\n    $$\n    This expression must be evaluated at $p \\in \\partial M$, which corresponds to $x^0=0$. At the boundary, the induced metric $\\bar{g}$ has components $\\bar{g}_{ij}(x) = g_{ij}(0, x)$. Consequently, $\\bar{g}^{ij}(x) = g^{ij}(0, x)$. The partial derivatives $\\partial_i$ for $i \\geq 1$ are tangential to the boundary. Therefore, at any point on $\\partial M$:\n    $$\n    g_{ij}|_{\\partial M} = \\bar{g}_{ij}, \\quad g^{ij}|_{\\partial M} = \\bar{g}^{ij}, \\quad \\partial_k g_{ij}|_{\\partial M} = \\partial_k \\bar{g}_{ij}\n    $$\n    The Christoffel symbols $\\bar{\\Gamma}^k_{ij}$ of the induced metric connection $\\bar{\\nabla}$ are given by:\n    $$\n    \\bar{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{g}^{kl} (\\partial_i \\bar{g}_{jl} + \\partial_j \\bar{g}_{il} - \\partial_l \\bar{g}_{ij})\n    $$\n    By direct comparison of the two formulas evaluated at $p$, we see they are identical.\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) = \\bar{\\Gamma}^k_{ij}(p)\n    $$\n\nCombining these results, the values of the Christoffel symbols at $p$ are:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}_{00}(p) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}_{0i}(p) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}_{ij}(p) = -\\mathrm{II}_{ij}(p)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}(p) = \\bar{\\Gamma}^{k}_{ij}(p)\n$$\nThe problem asks for these to be reported as a single row matrix. For notational simplicity in the final answer, we denote the components of the second fundamental form at $p$ by $\\mathrm{II}_{ij}$ and the Christoffel symbols of the induced connection at $p$ by $\\bar{\\Gamma}^k_{ij}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -\\mathrm{II}_{ij} & \\bar{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2985130"}]}
