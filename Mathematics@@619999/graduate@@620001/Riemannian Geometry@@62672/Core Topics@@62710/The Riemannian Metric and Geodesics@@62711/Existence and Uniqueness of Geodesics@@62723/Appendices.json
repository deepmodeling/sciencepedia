Provide your final answer as a single integer with no units.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of geodesics on a flat $n$-torus, culminating in a specific calculation for $n=5$. The solution is presented in three parts, following the structure of the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Geodesics and Homotopy Classes\n\nA geodesic on a Riemannian manifold is a curve $\\alpha(t)$ whose acceleration vector is orthogonal to the tangent space at each point, which is equivalent to the condition that the covariant derivative of its velocity vector along the curve is zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\alpha}}\\dot{\\alpha} = 0$.\n\nThe flat $n$-torus $\\mathbb{T}^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is endowed with the quotient metric induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The canonical projection $\\pi : \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{T}^{n}$ is a local isometry. This means that for any point in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, there is a neighborhood on which $\\pi$ is an isometry onto its image. For a flat metric, the Christoffel symbols are all zero. Since the Christoffel symbols are determined by the metric, they are also zero for the quotient metric on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ in the local coordinates inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe geodesic equation in local coordinates $u^i$ is $\\frac{d^2 u^i}{dt^2} + \\sum_{j,k} \\Gamma_{jk}^i \\frac{du^j}{dt}\\frac{du^k}{dt} = 0$. Since $\\Gamma_{jk}^i = 0$ for both $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{T}^n$, the geodesic equation simplifies to $\\frac{d^2 u^i}{dt^2} = 0$. This implies that geodesics are curves that become straight lines in local coordinates.\n\nA straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = a + tb$ for vectors $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. This curve satisfies $\\ddot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(t) = 0$, so it is a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which aligns with the given definition (i).\n\nConsider the curve $\\gamma_{k}(t) = x + t\\big((y + k) - x\\big)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This is a straight-line segment. Its projection onto the torus is $\\alpha_k(t) = \\pi \\circ \\gamma_{k}(t)$. Since $\\pi$ is a local isometry (given definition (ii)), it maps geodesics of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to geodesics of $\\mathbb{T}^n$. Thus, $\\alpha_k(t)$ is a geodesic on $\\mathbb{T}^n$.\n\nWe must check the endpoints. At $t=0$, $\\alpha_k(0) = \\pi(\\gamma_k(0)) = \\pi(x) = p$. At $t=1$, $\\gamma_k(1) = x + \\big((y + k) - x\\big) = y+k$. Since $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, $y$ and $y+k$ belong to the same fiber of the covering map $\\pi$. Thus, $\\alpha_k(1) = \\pi(y+k) = \\pi(y) = q$. So, $\\pi \\circ \\gamma_k$ is a geodesic joining $p$ to $q$.\n\nNext, we show that different values of $k$ result in geodesics in different fixed-endpoint homotopy classes. The theory of covering spaces states that fixed-endpoint homotopy classes of paths from $p$ to $q$ in $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the lifts of these paths starting at a fixed point $x \\in \\pi^{-1}(p)$ and ending at various points in the fiber $\\pi^{-1}(q) = \\{y+k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$.\n\nLet $\\alpha_1(t) = \\pi(\\gamma_{k_1}(t))$ and $\\alpha_2(t) = \\pi(\\gamma_{k_2}(t))$ be two such geodesics. If they are in the same fixed-endpoint homotopy class, any homotopy between them can be lifted to a homotopy in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ between their lifts, $\\gamma_{k_1}$ and $\\gamma_{k_2}$, which must also have fixed endpoints. The starting point for both lifted paths is $x$. The endpoint of $\\gamma_{k_1}$ is $y+k_1$ and the endpoint of $\\gamma_{k_2}$ is $y+k_2$. For a fixed-endpoint homotopy lift, the endpoints must be the same, so $y+k_1 = y+k_2$, which implies $k_1 = k_2$. This means that if $k_1 \\neq k_2$, the geodesics $\\pi \\circ \\gamma_{k_1}$ and $\\pi \\circ \\gamma_{k_2}$ lie in different homotopy classes.\n\nFurthermore, within a single homotopy class (fixed $k$), the geodesic is unique. The geodesic in $\\mathbb{T}^n$ corresponds to the geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ joining $x$ to $y+k$. As a complete, simply connected manifold with non-positive sectional curvature (zero curvature), $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has a unique geodesic between any two points, which is the straight line segment. Therefore, $\\gamma_k$ is the unique geodesic joining $x$ and $y+k$. Its projection, $\\pi \\circ \\gamma_k$, is the unique geodesic in its homotopy class. If two projected geodesics are in the same homotopy class, they must be projections of the same straight line segment in the cover, and thus they agree as curves.\n\n### Part 2: Length Minimization\n\nThe length of a curve $\\alpha(t)$ on a Riemannian manifold is given by the integral of the norm of its velocity vector, $L(\\alpha) = \\int_0^1 \\|\\dot{\\alpha}(t)\\| dt$. Since the projection $\\pi$ is a local isometry, it preserves lengths of tangent vectors, and therefore the length of a curve. The length of the projected geodesic $\\pi \\circ \\gamma_k$ is equal to the length of the segment $\\gamma_k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe velocity vector of $\\gamma_k(t) = x + t(y+k-x)$ is constant:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_k(t) = (y+k) - x $$\nLet $v = y-x$. Then $\\dot{\\gamma}_k(t) = v+k$. The norm of this vector is also constant: $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}_k(t)\\| = \\|v+k\\|$.\nThe length of the geodesic is:\n$$ L(\\pi \\circ \\gamma_k) = L(\\gamma_k) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\|v+k\\| dt = \\|v+k\\| \\int_{0}^{1} dt = \\|v+k\\| $$\nTo find the minimizing geodesics, we must find the integer vectors $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ that minimize this length. This is equivalent to minimizing the squared length, $\\|v+k\\|^2$. Let $v=(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ and $k=(k_1, \\dots, k_n)$.\n$$ \\|v+k\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (v_i + k_i)^2 $$\nThe sum is minimized if and only if each term $(v_i+k_i)^2$ is minimized independently with respect to the integer choice $k_i$. Minimizing $(v_i+k_i)^2$ is equivalent to minimizing $|v_i+k_i|$. This means we must choose the integer $k_i$ such that $-k_i$ is the integer closest to $v_i$.\n\nFor any real number $v_i$, there is a unique integer closest to it, unless $v_i$ is exactly halfway between two consecutive integers, i.e., $v_i = m + 1/2$ for some integer $m$. This condition is equivalent to $v_i \\pmod 1 = 1/2$.\n- If $v_i \\pmod 1 \\neq 1/2$, there is a unique integer $-k_i$ closest to $v_i$, and thus a unique choice for $k_i$ that minimizes $|v_i+k_i|$.\n- If $v_i \\pmod 1 = 1/2$, there are two integers equally close to $v_i$ (namely $v_i - 1/2$ and $v_i + 1/2$), and thus two choices for $-k_i$. These two choices give two values for $k_i$ that minimize $|v_i+k_i|$.\n\nThe total number of minimizing vectors $k$ is the product of the number of minimizing choices for each component $k_i$. This will be $2$ for each component $v_i$ that is congruent to $1/2 \\pmod 1$, and $1$ for all other components.\nLet $N_{1/2}$ be the number of coordinates $v_i$ of $v=y-x$ such that $v_i \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 1$. The number of distinct minimizing homotopy classes (and thus minimizing geodesics) is $2^{N_{1/2}}$.\n\nLet $w = (w_1, \\dots, w_n)$ be the coordinate vector of $v$ modulo $\\mathbb{Z}$, with each $w_i \\in [0,1)$. The condition $v_i \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 1$ becomes $w_i = 1/2$. The number of such coordinates can be written using the signum function $\\text{sgn}(x)$, where $\\text{sgn}(0)=0$. The number of minimizing classes is given by the expression:\n$$ 2^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1-\\text{sgn}|2w_i - 1|)} $$\nThis expression works because if $w_i=1/2$, the argument of sgn is $0$, giving $1-\\text{sgn}(0) = 1$. If $w_i \\neq 1/2$, then $|2w_i - 1| > 0$, giving $1-\\text{sgn}(|...|) = 1-1=0$. The sum therefore counts the number of coordinates equal to $1/2$.\n\n### Part 3: Specific Calculation for $n=5$\n\nWe are given $n=5$, $p = \\pi(0,0,0,0,0)$, and $q = \\pi\\!\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{2}, 0, \\tfrac{1}{2}, 0\\big)$.\nWe can choose the lifts $x = (0,0,0,0,0)$ and $y = \\big(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0, \\frac{1}{2}, 0\\big)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\nThen, the vector $v = y-x$ is:\n$$ v = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0, \\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) $$\nWe need to count how many components $v_i$ of this vector $v$ are congruent to $1/2$ modulo $1$.\n- $v_1 = 1/2$. $1/2 \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 1$.\n- $v_2 = 1/2$. $1/2 \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 1$.\n- $v_3 = 0$. $0 \\not\\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 1$.\n- $v_4 = 1/2$. $1/2 \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 1$.\n- $v_5 = 0$. $0 \\not\\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 1$.\n\nThe number of such components, $N_{1/2}$, is $3$.\nThe number of minimizing geodesics is $2^{N_{1/2}} = 2^3$.\n$$ 2^3 = 8 $$\nThere are $8$ distinct minimizing geodesics joining $p$ and $q$ on this $5$-torus.
