Using only foundational definitions (Riemannian metric, geodesic, Riemannian distance) and widely established facts (compact Riemannian manifolds are metrically complete, completeness implies the existence of distance-minimizing geodesics between any two points, and geodesics on the round sphere are great circles understood via vanishing geodesic curvature), do the following:\n\n1. Compute the Riemannian distance $d(p,-p)$ as an exact expression in terms of $R$. Angles must be measured in radians.\n2. Explain why there exist multiple distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$, and relate this multiplicity to the cut locus of $p$.\n\nProvide the final distance as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $R$. No rounding is required, and no physical units are to be used in the final expression.", "solution": "We start from the core definitions. The Riemannian distance $d(x,y)$ between two points $x,y$ in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths, with respect to $g$, of all piecewise smooth curves joining $x$ to $y$. A geodesic is a curve $\\gamma$ satisfying the geodesic equation with respect to the Levi-Civita connection, and locally it extremizes (and in particular, for sufficiently short segments, minimizes) the length functional. A compact Riemannian manifold is complete as a metric space, and by the Hopf–Rinow theorem, in a complete, connected Riemannian manifold any two points can be joined by a minimizing geodesic.\n\nOn the round sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, geodesics are exactly the great circles, i.e., intersections of $S^{2}_{R}$ with two-dimensional linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ passing through the origin. This classical fact can be justified intrinsically by observing that the geodesic curvature of a great circle is zero, and extrinsically by noting that a great circle is a circle of radius $R$ lying in a plane through the origin and has acceleration purely normal to the sphere, with vanishing tangential component under the Levi-Civita connection; hence it satisfies the geodesic equation.\n\nFix $p \\in S^{2}_{R}$. Any plane through the origin containing $p$ also contains $-p$ and intersects $S^{2}_{R}$ in a great circle. On that great circle, parameterize the arc from $p$ to $-p$ by the central angle $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$ at the center $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Along a great circle of radius $R$, the arclength element is $R \\, d\\theta$ because the circle is a Euclidean circle of radius $R$ sitting in a plane, and the length of an arc subtending angle $\\theta$ is $R \\theta$ when angles are measured in radians. Therefore, the length of the geodesic arc from $p$ to $-p$ along any great circle is\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} R \\, d\\theta = R \\pi.\n$$\nThis shows that $d(p,-p) \\leq R \\pi$. To see that this is in fact the exact distance, we note that any curve on the sphere connecting $p$ to $-p$ must, when projected radially onto the plane containing any chosen great circle through $p$ and $-p$, have length at least that of the corresponding circular arc, and the minimizing curves are segments of great circles. More intrinsically, by the completeness of $S^{2}_{R}$ and Hopf–Rinow, there exists a minimizing geodesic between $p$ and $-p$; every geodesic joining these points lies on a great circle and necessarily subtends central angle $\\pi$, so its length is $R \\pi$. Thus the infimum is achieved and equals $R \\pi$, hence\n$$\nd(p,-p) = R \\pi.\n$$\n\nNext, we explain the existence of multiple distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$ and relate it to the cut locus. The cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ of a point $p$ in a Riemannian manifold is, informally, the set of endpoints of maximal distance-minimizing geodesic segments emanating from $p$, equivalently the closure of points where different minimizing geodesics from $p$ coalesce or where the exponential map ceases to be injective. On $S^{2}_{R}$, the cut locus of $p$ is the singleton $\\{-p\\}$. Indeed, for any $q \\in S^{2}_{R}$ with $q \\neq -p$, there is a unique great circle determined by the plane spanned by $p$ and $q$, and among the two arcs from $p$ to $q$ on this great circle, the shorter one has central angle strictly less than $\\pi$ and is the unique minimizing geodesic. At $q = -p$, however, every plane through the origin containing $p$ yields a great circle containing $-p$, and along each such great circle there are two antipodal half-circles from $p$ to $-p$ of length $R \\pi$. The set of such planes is parametrized by the unit vectors in the tangent space $T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$; hence there is a continuum of distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$. Moreover, beyond $-p$ along any such geodesic, the curve ceases to minimize distance, reflecting that the injectivity radius at $p$ is $R \\pi$ and that $\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the exact Riemannian distance between antipodal points on the round sphere of radius $R$ is $R \\pi$, angles understood in radians, and the multiplicity of minimizing geodesics at the antipode is precisely the manifestation of the cut locus being the antipodal point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi R}$$", "id": "2998901"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall is to conflate completeness with compactness.

However, the Riemannian distance to this boundary is infinite.\n\nTo compute the arc-length $L(y; y_0)$ of a vertical geodesic segment, let the path be $\\gamma$ joining $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x_0, y)$.

Since length must be positive, we take the absolute value.\n$$\nL(y; y_0) = \\left| \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{y_0}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nThis calculation informs the question of geodesic completeness. A Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if every geodesic can be extended for all values of its parameter $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. Consider a unit-speed geodesic moving along a vertical line towards the boundary $y=0$. For a unit-speed parameterization $t$, the arc-length is simply the elapsed parameter time. The arc-length from any point $(x_0, y_0)$ with $y_0>0$ to a point $(x_0, \\epsilon)$ with $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$ is $L = |\\ln(\\epsilon/y_0)| = \\ln(y_0/\\epsilon)$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, $L \\to \\infty$. This implies that the boundary $\\{y=0\\}$ is infinitely far away from any point in the manifold. A geodesic, parameterized by arc-length, would require an infinite amount of time to reach this boundary. Therefore, no geodesic can leave the manifold in finite time. Every geodesic is defined for all $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$, and the manifold is geodesically complete.\n\nThe Hopf-Rinow theorem provides several equivalent characterizations of completeness for a Riemannian manifold. One of the equivalences states that a manifold $(M, g)$ is geodesically complete if and only if the associated metric space $(M, d)$ is complete, where $d$ is the distance function induced by the metric $g$. Our finding that the distance to the boundary is infinite implies that any Cauchy sequence of points in $(M, d)$ must have a limit point within $M$ (i.e., its $y$-coordinate is bounded away from zero), meaning $(M, d)$ is a complete metric space. Thus, by the Hopf-Rinow theorem, $(M, g)$ is geodesically complete, which is consistent with our direct analysis of the geodesic paths.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left| \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{y_{0}}\\right) \\right|}\n$$", "id": "3028591"}]}
