Since $\\Gamma$ is smooth, the mixed partial derivatives are equal, $\\frac{\\partial^2\\Gamma^k}{\\partial s \\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2\\Gamma^k}{\\partial t \\partial s}$. Also, because the connection is torsion-free, the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices, $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\Gamma^k_{ji}$. Swapping the dummy indices $i$ and $j$ in the last term of the expression for $(\\nabla_t \\partial_s \\Gamma)^k$ shows that the components of $\\nabla_s \\partial_t \\Gamma$ and $\\nabla_t \\partial_s \\Gamma$ are identical. The difference is thus the zero vector field.\n\n(c) We compute the first variation of the energy functional $E(s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} g(\\partial_t\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) dt$. We differentiate with respect to $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} g(\\partial_t\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) dt \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} g(\\partial_t\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) dt\n$$\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is metric-compatible, which means $\\nabla g = 0$. This implies that for any vector fields $X, Y, Z$, the derivative of their inner product is given by $Z(g(X,Y)) = g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)$. Applying this rule with the derivative operator $\\nabla_s = \\nabla_{\\partial_s \\Gamma}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} g(\\partial_t\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) = g(\\nabla_s \\partial_t\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) + g(\\partial_t\\Gamma, \\nabla_s \\partial_t\\Gamma) = 2g(\\nabla_s \\partial_t\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\frac{dE}{ds}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds} = \\int_{0}^{1} g(\\nabla_s \\partial_t\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) dt\n$$\nUsing the result from part (b), $\\nabla_s \\partial_t\\Gamma = \\nabla_t \\partial_s\\Gamma$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds} = \\int_{0}^{1} g(\\nabla_t \\partial_s\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) dt\n$$\nWe now perform integration by parts on this integral. The metric compatibility rule can be written for derivatives along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ as $\\frac{d}{dt}g(X,Y) = g(\\nabla_t X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_t Y)$. This gives $g(\\nabla_t \\partial_s\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) = \\frac{d}{dt}g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) - g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\nabla_t \\partial_t\\Gamma)$.\nSubstituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\frac{d}{dt}g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) - g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\nabla_t \\partial_t\\Gamma) \\right) dt\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the integral of the first term is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{d}{dt}g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) dt = \\left[ g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) \\right]_{t=0}^{t=1}\n$$\nThe variation $\\Gamma$ has fixed endpoints, $\\Gamma(s,0)=p$ and $\\Gamma(s,1)=q$, which are independent of $s$. Differentiating with respect to $s$ gives $\\partial_s\\Gamma(s,0) = 0$ and $\\partial_s\\Gamma(s,1) = 0$. The variational vector field $\\partial_s\\Gamma$ vanishes at the endpoints $t=0$ and $t=1$. Therefore, the boundary term is zero:\n$$\n\\left[ g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\partial_t\\Gamma) \\right]_{t=0}^{t=1} = g(\\partial_s\\Gamma(s,1), \\partial_t\\Gamma(s,1)) - g(\\partial_s\\Gamma(s,0), \\partial_t\\Gamma(s,0)) = g(0, \\partial_t\\Gamma(s,1)) - g(0, \\partial_t\\Gamma(s,0)) = 0\n$$\nThe first variation formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds} = - \\int_{0}^{1} g(\\partial_s\\Gamma, \\nabla_t \\partial_t\\Gamma) dt\n$$\nWe are asked to evaluate this at $s=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} = - \\int_{0}^{1} g(\\partial_s\\Gamma(0,t), \\nabla_t \\partial_t\\Gamma(0,t)) dt\n$$\nThe problem states that the central curve $\\gamma(t) = \\Gamma(0,t)$ is a geodesic, which by definition satisfies the geodesic equation $\\nabla_t \\partial_t\\Gamma(0,t) = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nSubstituting the geodesic equation into the expression for the first variation at $s=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} = - \\int_{0}^{1} g(\\partial_s\\Gamma(0,t), 0) dt = - \\int_{0}^{1} 0 \\, dt = 0\n$$\nThe final value is $0$. This demonstrates that geodesics are critical points of the energy functional.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2976659"}]}
