A right circular cone is a developable surface, meaning it can be \"unrolled\" onto a plane without stretching or compression. This unrolling process is, by definition, an isometry.\n\nLet's model $C_{\\alpha}$ by considering a sector of the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the Euclidean metric is $ds^2 = d\\rho^2 + \\rho^2 d\\phi^2$. Consider a sector $S_{\\alpha}$ defined by $\\rho > 0$ and $0 \\leq \\phi \\leq \\alpha$. If we identify the two radial edges of this sector (the ray at $\\phi=0$ and the ray at $\\phi=\\alpha$), we form a cone. The coordinate $\\rho$ on the plane becomes the slant distance $r$ from the apex on the cone. The circumference of a circle at radius $\\rho$ in the plane is $2\\pi\\rho$. On the cone formed from the sector, the corresponding path is a loop of length $\\alpha \\rho$. This matches the problem's definition, where the circumference at distance $r$ is $\\alpha r$.\n\nSo, we can create a chart for the cone $C_{\\alpha}$ using coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ where $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ is the slant distance and $\\theta$ is an angular coordinate. The metric induced from the ambient $\\mathbb{R}^3$ results in a circumference of $\\alpha r$ for a circle of constant $r$. We can define a new angular coordinate $\\phi = (\\alpha/2\\pi) \\theta'$ for some standard angle $\\theta'$. More directly, we can use the planar sector coordinates. Let's use coordinates $(r, \\phi')$ on the cone, where $r$ is the slant height and $\\phi' \\in [0, \\alpha)$ is the angle in the unrolled sector. In these coordinates, the metric is simply the Euclidean metric in polar coordinates:\n$$ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 (d\\phi')^2$$\nThis coordinate chart covers the entire cone $C_{\\alpha}$ (less one generator, which is a standard issue with polar-type coordinates but does not affect local properties). At any point on the cone, we can find a neighborhood and a coordinate system in which the metric has this Euclidean form.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $C_{\\alpha}$ is locally isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.**\n\nAs demonstrated above, for any point $p \\in C_{\\alpha}$, we can find a neighborhood and a coordinate chart $(r, \\phi')$ such that the metric tensor is given by $g_{rr}=1$, $g_{\\phi'\\phi'}=r^2$, and $g_{r\\phi'}=0$. This is precisely the component form of the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ expressed in polar coordinates. The map from this neighborhood on the cone to a corresponding open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by these coordinates is an isometry. By definition, this means $C_{\\alpha}$ is locally isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The Gaussian curvature $K$ of $C_{\\alpha}$ vanishes identically on $C_{\\alpha}$.**\n\nGaussian curvature $K$ is an intrinsic property of a surface, meaning it is determined entirely by the metric (the first fundamental form). A fundamental result, often seen as a corollary of Gauss's *Theorema Egregium*, is that local isometries preserve Gaussian curvature.\nFrom the analysis of option A, we established that $C_{\\alpha}$ is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The Gaussian curvature of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is identically zero, $K_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\equiv 0$.\nSince $K$ is a local invariant, the Gaussian curvature of $C_{\\alpha}$ at any point must be equal to the Gaussian curvature of the corresponding point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ under the local isometry. Therefore, the Gaussian curvature of $C_{\\alpha}$ must also be identically zero, $K_{C_{\\alpha}} \\equiv 0$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The holonomy representation of the Levi-Civita connection on $C_{\\alpha}$ maps a loop that winds once around the apex to a rotation in $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ by the angular deficit $2\\pi-\\alpha$, so the holonomy group is nontrivial.**\n\nHolonomy measures the failure of a vector to return to its original orientation after being parallel transported around a closed loop. For a manifold with vanishing curvature ($K \\equiv 0$), the holonomy is trivial for any contractible loop. However, $C_{\\alpha}$ is not simply connected; its topology is that of an open cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. A loop that winds once around the apex is not contractible.\n\nWe analyze parallel transport using the unrolled sector model. A loop $\\gamma$ on the cone at a constant slant distance $r_0$ corresponds to a circular arc of radius $r_0$ in the planar sector, running from the edge at angle $\\phi=0$ to the edge at $\\phi=\\alpha$. Parallel transport in the plane is trivial: a vector's components in a fixed Cartesian basis remain constant.\n\nLet $v_0$ be a tangent vector at a point $p$ on the ray $\\phi=0$. When parallel transported along the arc to the corresponding point $q$ on the ray $\\phi=\\alpha$, the resulting vector $v_f$ is parallel to $v_0$ in the ambient plane's sense. However, to close the loop on the cone, we must identify the point $q$ with $p$ and the tangent space $T_q C_{\\alpha}$ with $T_p C_{\\alpha}$. This identification involves rotating the ray $\\phi=\\alpha$ back to align with the ray $\\phi=0$. This rotation is through an angle of $-\\alpha$. This is not the holonomy angle.\n\nThe correct way to compute the rotation is to consider the sum of exterior angles of a polygon approximating the loop. Or, more directly, it is a known result that for a conical singularity, the holonomy angle around the singularity is the *angular deficit*. The total angle around a point on the cone surface is $\\alpha$, whereas for a point in the plane it is $2\\pi$. The angular deficit is the difference: $2\\pi - \\alpha$.\nSince $\\alpha \\in(0, 2\\pi)$, this angular deficit is strictly positive. Parallel transporting a vector around a non-contractible loop that encloses the apex results in a rotation by this angle $2\\pi - \\alpha$. This is a non-trivial rotation, which means the holonomy group is non-trivial.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because $K\\equiv 0$ on $C_{\\alpha}$, there exists a global isometry $\\Phi:C_{\\alpha}\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$.**\n\nThis statement makes a claim about global geometry based on a local property. The condition $K \\equiv 0$ implies the existence of local isometries to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A global isometry requires not only matching local geometry but also matching topology.\nA global isometry $\\Phi: C_{\\alpha} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ would have to be a diffeomorphism, which means it must be a homeomorphism.\nThe cone $C_{\\alpha}$ (with apex removed) is topologically equivalent to $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. Its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(C_{\\alpha}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, as demonstrated by the non-contractible loops discussed in option C.\nThe Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is topologically a disk. It is simply connected, meaning its fundamental group is trivial, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\cong \\{0\\}$.\nSince $C_{\\alpha}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^2$ have different fundamental groups, they are not homeomorphic. Therefore, they cannot be diffeomorphic, and no global isometry between them can exist. The fact that the unrolling map provides a global isometry from $C_{\\alpha}$ to a proper subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (a sector) reinforces this conclusion; this map cannot be extended to be a surjective map onto all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For any contractible loop $\\gamma$ in $C_{\\alpha}$, parallel transport around $\\gamma$ rotates tangent vectors by the angular deficit $2\\pi-\\alpha$.**\n\nA contractible loop $\\gamma$ on a surface is one that can be continuously deformed to a point. Such a loop bounds a region $R$ that lies entirely within the manifold. The angle of rotation $\\Delta\\theta$ for a vector parallel transported around a loop $\\gamma$ bounding a region $R$ is given by the integral of the Gaussian curvature over that region:\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\iint_R K \\, dA$$\nThis is a simplified version of the Ambrose-Singer Holonomy Theorem for $2$-manifolds. As established in option B, the Gaussian curvature of the cone $C_{\\alpha}$ is identically zero, $K \\equiv 0$.\nTherefore, for any contractible loop $\\gamma$, the integral is:\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\iint_R 0 \\, dA = 0$$\nThis means that for any contractible loop, parallel transport is trivial; the vector returns to its original orientation. The rotation is by an angle of $0$, not the non-zero angular deficit $2\\pi-\\alpha$. The non-trivial holonomy only occurs for non-contractible loops.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2976058"}]}
