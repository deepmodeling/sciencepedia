The Weingarten map $S \\colon T_pM \\to T_pM$ is defined by the relation $\\mathrm{d}n_p(v) = -\\mathrm{d}f_p(S(v))$. Using this, we can express $v_t$ in terms of entities defined on the original surface $M$:\n$$ v_t = \\mathrm{d}f_p(v) - t\\,\\mathrm{d}f_p(S(v)) = \\mathrm{d}f_p(v - tS(v)) $$\nFor convenience, let's define an endomorphism $A_t \\colon T_pM \\to T_pM$ as $A_t = Id - tS$, where $Id$ is the identity map. Then, $v_t = \\mathrm{d}f_p(A_t(v))$. The problem assumes $t$ is in a range where $f_t$ is a regular immersion, which means $A_t$ is invertible.\n\nThe normal curvature $k_n^t$ of the surface $f_t(M)$ in the direction induced by $v$ is the ratio of its second and first fundamental forms (pulled back to M), $II_t$ and $I_t$, evaluated on $v$:\n$$ k_n^t(v) = \\frac{II_t(v, v)}{I_t(v, v)} $$\nWe now derive expressions for $I_t$ and $II_t$ in terms of the fundamental forms $I$, $II$, $III$ of the original surface.\nThe first fundamental form $I_t$ is defined by the inner product of tangent vectors. For $v, w \\in T_pM$:\n$$ I_t(v, w) = \\langle \\mathrm{d}f_t(v), \\mathrm{d}f_t(w) \\rangle = \\langle \\mathrm{d}f_p(A_t(v)), \\mathrm{d}f_p(A_t(w)) \\rangle $$\nBy the definition of the first fundamental form $I$ of $M$, this is $I(A_t(v), A_t(w))$. Substituting $A_t = Id - tS$ and expanding gives:\n$$ I_t(v, w) = I(v - tS(v), w - tS(w)) = I(v,w) - t\\,I(v, S(w)) - t\\,I(S(v), w) + t^2\\,I(S(v), S(w)) $$\nThe Weingarten map $S$ is self-adjoint with respect to $I$, meaning $I(v, S(w)) = I(S(v), w)$. Using the problem's definitions, $II(v,w) = I(S(v),w)$ and $III(v,w) = I(S(v),S(w))$, we obtain:\n$$ I_t(v, w) = I(v, w) - 2t\\,II(v, w) + t^2\\,III(v, w) $$\nTo find the second fundamental form $II_t$, we first need the Weingarten map $S_t$ of the parallel surface. The tangent planes of $M$ and $f_t(M)$ are parallel, so we can choose the normal field of $f_t(M)$ to be $n_t = n$. The map $S_t$ is defined by $\\mathrm{d}f_t(S_t(v)) = -\\mathrm{d}n_t(v)$. With $n_t=n$, we have $\\mathrm{d}n_t(v) = \\mathrm{d}n(v) = -\\mathrm{d}f(S(v))$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}f_t(S_t(v)) = \\mathrm{d}f(S(v)) \\implies \\mathrm{d}f(A_t(S_t(v))) = \\mathrm{d}f(S(v)) $$\nSince $\\mathrm{d}f$ is injective on tangent vectors, we have $A_t(S_t(v)) = S(v)$, which yields $S_t = A_t^{-1}S = (Id - tS)^{-1}S$.\nThe second fundamental form $II_t$ is given by $II_t(v,w) = I_t(S_t(v), w)$. Substituting our expressions for $I_t$ and $S_t$:\n$$ II_t(v, w) = I(A_t(S_t(v)), A_t(w)) = I(A_t((Id - tS)^{-1}S(v)), (Id - tS)(w)) $$\nSince $S$ and $(Id - tS)$ commute, we simplify this to:\n$$ II_t(v, w) = I(S(v), (Id - tS)(w)) = I(S(v), w) - t\\,I(S(v), S(w)) = II(v,w) - t\\,III(v,w) $$\nNow we can construct the normal curvature by taking the ratio of the quadratic forms for $v=w$:\n$$ k_n^t(v) = \\frac{II_t(v, v)}{I_t(v, v)} = \\frac{II(v, v) - t\\,III(v, v)}{I(v, v) - 2t\\,II(v, v) + t^2\\,III(v, v)} $$\nThis is the desired analytic expression.\n\nFor the second part of the question, we analyze the behavior near focal points. A focal point occurs for a value of $t$ where the map $A_t = Id - tS$ becomes singular. This happens when $t=1/\\kappa_i$ for some non-zero principal curvature $\\kappa_i$ of $M$ at $p$.\nLet's analyze the denominator of the normal curvature expression:\n$$ D(t,v) = I(v, v) - 2t\\,II(v, v) + t^2\\,III(v, v) = I(v-tS(v), v-tS(v)) = I(A_t(v), A_t(v)) $$\nThis term is the squared length of the vector $A_t(v)$ with respect to the metric $I$.\nLet $e_i$ be a principal direction corresponding to a principal curvature $\\kappa_i$. So $S(e_i) = \\kappa_i e_i$. If we evaluate the normal curvature in this direction, i.e., set $v=e_i$:\n$A_t(e_i) = (Id - tS)(e_i) = (1-t\\kappa_i)e_i$.\nThe denominator becomes $D(t,e_i) = I((1-t\\kappa_i)e_i, (1-t\\kappa_i)e_i) = (1-t\\kappa_i)^2 I(e_i, e_i)$.\nThe numerator becomes $N(t,e_i) = II_t(e_i,e_i) = II(e_i,e_i) - t\\,III(e_i,e_i) = \\kappa_i I(e_i,e_i) - t\\kappa_i^2I(e_i,e_i) = \\kappa_i(1-t\\kappa_i)I(e_i,e_i)$.\nThe normal curvature in a principal direction $e_i$ simplifies to:\n$$ k_n^t(e_i) = \\frac{\\kappa_i(1 - t\\kappa_i)I(e_i, e_i)}{(1-t\\kappa_i)^2 I(e_i, e_i)} = \\frac{\\kappa_i}{1 - t\\kappa_i} $$\nThis expression clearly shows that as $t$ approaches a value $1/\\kappa_i$ corresponding to a focal point, the normal curvature in the associated principal direction $e_i$ diverges to $\\pm\\infty$, exhibiting a simple pole. This corresponds to the surface developing a cusp or singularity.\nConversely, for a vector $v$ that is not a principal direction associated with $\\kappa_i$ (and assuming the point is not umbilic), the vector $A_t(v)$ does not approach the zero vector as $t \\to 1/\\kappa_i$. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator of the general expression for $k_n^t(v)$ converge to finite, non-zero limits (assuming $v$ is not aligned with $e_i$). Thus, the normal curvature in any direction other than the principal one associated with the focal point remains finite. The singular behavior of curvature at a focal point is therefore highly directional, confined to the principal direction(s) that define it.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{II(v, v) - t\\,III(v, v)}{I(v, v) - 2t\\,II(v, v) + t^{2}\\,III(v, v)}} $$", "id": "3003332"}]}
