The definitions and premises are scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained.

The Riemannian metric on $T^2$ is the one induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, given in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ by $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$. This means the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ is a local isometry. A fundamental consequence of this definition is that the intrinsic Gaussian curvature of this \"flat torus\" is identically zero, $K \\equiv 0$.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of a Local Isometric Immersion**\n\nWe are asked to construct a smooth isometric immersion $\\varphi: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ for a coordinate neighborhood $U \\subset T^2$, such that the image $\\varphi(U)$ has Gaussian curvature $K=0$. The neighborhood $U$ is chosen such that its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is an open rectangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet this open rectangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ be $V = (u_1, u_2) \\times (v_1, v_2)$. Since the quotient map $\\pi$ is a local isometry, the neighborhood $(U, g_U)$ is isometric to the rectangle $(V, g_{Euc})$, where $g_U$ is the metric on $U$ and $g_{Euc}$ is the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In coordinates $(u, v)$ on $V$, the metric is given by the first fundamental form $ds^2 = du^2 + dv^2$. Our task reduces to finding a smooth isometric immersion of this rectangle $V$ into $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nA surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ has zero Gaussian curvature if and only if it is a developable surface. The simplest non-planar example of a developable surface is a right circular cylinder. Let us define a mapping $\\varphi: V \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ that wraps the rectangle onto a piece of a cylinder. For simplicity, we choose a cylinder of radius $R=1$ whose axis is the $z$-axis. Let the map be:\n$$ \\varphi(u, v) = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), v) $$\nThis map is smooth (infinitely differentiable) since its component functions are smooth. To verify that it is an isometric immersion, we must compute its first fundamental form and check that its partial derivatives are linearly independent.\n\nThe partial derivatives of $\\varphi$ with respect to the coordinates $u$ and $v$ are:\n$$ \\varphi_u = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial u} = (-\\sin(u), \\cos(u), 0) $$\n$$ \\varphi_v = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial v} = (0, 0, 1) $$\nThe coefficients of the first fundamental form ($E$, $F$, $G$) are the inner products of these tangent vectors:\n$ E = \\varphi_u \\cdot \\varphi_u = (-\\sin(u))^2 + (\\cos(u))^2 + 0^2 = \\sin^2(u) + \\cos^2(u) = 1 $\n$ F = \\varphi_u \\cdot \\varphi_v = (-\\sin(u))(0) + (\\cos(u))(0) + (0)(1) = 0 $\n$ G = \\varphi_v \\cdot \\varphi_v = 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 $\nThe induced metric on the image surface $\\varphi(V)$ is therefore $ds^2 = E \\, du^2 + 2F \\, du \\, dv + G \\, dv^2 = 1 \\, du^2 + 0 + 1 \\, dv^2 = du^2 + dv^2$. This is identical to the Euclidean metric on the domain $V$. Thus, the map $\\varphi$ is an isometry.\n\nThe map is an immersion because the cross product of the partial derivatives is non-zero:\n$$ \\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ -\\sin(u) & \\cos(u) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), 0) $$\nSince $\\|\\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v\\| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(u) + \\sin^2(u)} = 1 \\neq 0$, the vectors $\\varphi_u$ and $\\varphi_v$ are linearly independent everywhere, confirming that $\\varphi$ is an immersion.\n\nFinally, we must verify that the Gaussian curvature of the image surface $\\varphi(U)$ is zero. The unit normal vector to the surface is $\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v}{\\|\\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v\\|} = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), 0)$.

Substituting the values we found:\n$$ K = \\frac{(-1)(0) - 0^2}{(1)(1) - 0^2} = 0 $$\nThus, the constructed map $\\varphi(u,v) = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), v)$ is a smooth isometric immersion of a rectangular piece of the flat torus into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as a surface with zero Gaussian curvature.\n\n**Part 2: Non-existence of a Global Isometric Embedding**\n\nWe must explain why no smooth embedded isometric immersion of the entire compact flat torus $T^2$ into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ exists. This is a classic result in differential geometry. The argument proceeds in two stages.\n\nFirst, we argue that any compact, connected, smooth surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ must have at least one point of strictly positive Gaussian curvature. Let $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ be such a surface. Since $S$ is compact, it is closed and bounded. Consider the function $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(p) = \\|p\\|^2$, the squared distance from the origin. Since $S$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, $f$ must attain a maximum value at some point $p_0 \\in S$. At this point $p_0$, the surface $S$ is tangent to the sphere of radius $R = \\|p_0\\|$ centered at the origin, and $S$ lies entirely inside or on this sphere. This implies that the principal curvatures of $S$ at $p_0$, with respect to the outward-pointing normal (from the perspective of the sphere), must both be less than or equal to the curvature of the sphere, which is $1/R$. More importantly, for the surface $S$ itself, considered with its intrinsic normal, this geometric configuration means that at $p_0$, the surface bends away from the tangent plane in the same direction locally. This forces both principal curvatures $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$ to have the same sign (or be zero). Therefore, the Gaussian curvature $K(p_0) = \\kappa_1(p_0) \\kappa_2(p_0)$ must be non-negative, $K(p_0) \\ge 0$. A more rigorous theorem by van Heijenoort shows that a compact, connected surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ must have a point of strictly positive Gaussian curvature.\n\nIf there were a smooth isometric embedding of the flat torus $T^2$ into $\\mathbb{R}^3$, its image would be a compact, connected, smooth surface $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Because the embedding is isometric, the Gaussian curvature of $S$ (the extrinsic curvature) must be identical to the intrinsic curvature of the flat torus, which is $K \\equiv 0$. This contradicts the theorem that any such surface must have a point with $K > 0$.\n\nAn alternative line of reasoning that avoids directly invoking the $K>0$ theorem is as follows. Suppose a compact, connected, smoothly embedded surface $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ has Gaussian curvature $K \\equiv 0$ everywhere. The theory of developable surfaces shows that such a surface must be a \"generalized cylinder\"â€”a surface foliated by a family of parallel lines. However, a compact surface cannot contain a straight line, as a line is non-compact. The only way for such a surface to be compact is if it is entirely contained within a plane (i.e., it is a domain in a plane with boundary).\n\nThis leads to the second stage of the argument: justifying why the torus $T^2$ cannot be smoothly embedded in a plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is a topological impossibility. The torus and the plane have different topological properties. For instance, the genus of the torus is $g(T^2)=1$, while any subset of the plane is either planar (genus $0$) or a collection of such regions. A smooth embedding is a homeomorphism onto its image, which preserves topological properties like genus. Since $1 \\neq 0$, no such embedding is possible. Alternatively, consider a non-separating simple closed curve on the torus (e.g., a \"longitude\"). If the torus were embedded in the plane, the image of this curve would be a simple closed curve in the plane. By the Jordan Curve Theorem, this curve must separate the plane into a bounded interior and an unbounded exterior. This contradicts the fact that the original curve did not separate the torus.\n\nIn summary, a smooth isometric embedding of $T^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ would require its image to be a compact surface with $K \\equiv 0$. Geometric constraints on compact surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ imply such a surface must be planar. However, topological constraints forbid the embedding of a torus into a plane. This contradiction proves that no such global embedding exists. It is noteworthy that the Nash-Kuiper theorem allows for a $C^1$ isometric embedding, but such an embedding is highly wrinkled and not smooth ($C^2$ or higher).\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Integral**\n\nWe are asked to determine the value of $\\int_{T^2} K \\, dA$ for the flat torus.\n\nAs established, the metric on this torus is, by definition, the one induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ is a local isometry. The Gaussian curvature $K$ is an intrinsic property of the Riemannian metric, meaning it can be calculated entirely from the metric tensor components $g_{ij}$ and their derivatives in a local coordinate chart. Since the metric on $T^2$ is locally identical to the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, its Gaussian curvature must be locally identical to that of the Euclidean plane.\n\nThe standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is flat, meaning its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, its Gaussian curvature is $K_{Euc} = 0$ at every point. By local isometry, the Gaussian curvature of the flat torus $T^2$ must also be identically zero, $K_{T^2} \\equiv 0$.\n\nThe integral is therefore the integral of a function that is zero everywhere on the domain of integration:\n$$ \\int_{T^2} K \\, dA = \\int_{T^2} 0 \\, dA $$\nThe integral of a zero function over any domain is zero.\n$$ \\int_{T^2} 0 \\, dA = 0 $$\nThis result can be verified using the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem for compact surfaces without boundary, which states:\n$$ \\int_{T^2} K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(T^2) $$\nwhere $\\chi(T^2)$ is the Euler characteristic of the torus. The Euler characteristic of a torus is $\\chi(T^2) = 0$.

The solution will be derived from first principles as required, by analyzing the structure of the triangulation on the torus and applying the given definition of discrete curvature.\n\nThe flat torus $T^2$ is constructed as the quotient space $T^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2 / \\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the lattice generated by the linearly independent vectors $u=(\\ell,0)$ and $v=(s,t)$ with $\\ell>0$ and $t>0$. The metric on $T^2$ is induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This implies that geometric calculations (lengths, angles) within a fundamental domain of the lattice can be performed using standard Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe specified triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$ of $T^2$ is obtained from a triangulation of the fundamental parallelogram $P$. The vertices of this parallelogram in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are given as $0$, $u$, $v$, and $u+v$. The parallelogram is divided into two triangles by the diagonal connecting $0$ and $u+v$. Let these triangles be $T_1$ and $T_2$.\nThe vertices of triangle $T_1$ are $\\{0, u, u+v\\}$.\nThe vertices of triangle $T_2$ are $\\{0, v, u+v\\}$.\nThe set of all vertices of this tiling of the parallelogram $P$ is the set $V_P = \\{0, u, v, u+v\\}$.\n\nTo understand the triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$ on the torus, we must determine how these vertices are identified under the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$. Two points $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ correspond to the same point on the torus if their difference $p_1 - p_2$ is an element of the lattice $\\Lambda = \\{m u + n v \\mid m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. Let's examine the equivalence classes of the vertices in $V_P$:\n1. The vertex $0$ corresponds to the point $[0]$ on the torus.\n2. The vertex $u$ is identified with $0$ because $u - 0 = u = 1 \\cdot u + 0 \\cdot v \\in \\Lambda$. Thus, $[u]=[0]$.\n3. The vertex $v$ is identified with $0$ because $v - 0 = v = 0 \\cdot u + 1 \\cdot v \\in \\Lambda$. Thus, $[v]=[0]$.\n4. The vertex $u+v$ is identified with $0$ because $(u+v) - 0 = u+v = 1 \\cdot u + 1 \\cdot v \\in \\Lambda$. Thus, $[u+v]=[0]$.\n\nAll four vertices of the fundamental parallelogram are identified to a single point on the torus $T^2$. Therefore, the triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$ has exactly one vertex. Let us denote this single vertex by $p$.\n\nNext, we compute the discrete Gaussian curvature $K(p)$ at this vertex. The formula is given as $K(p) = 2\\pi - \\sum \\theta_i(p)$, where $\\sum \\theta_i(p)$ is the sum of the angles of all triangle corners in the triangulation that meet at $p$.\nThe single vertex $p$ on the torus is the image of all four vertices $\\{0, u, v, u+v\\}$ from the fundamental domain. This means that all angles of the triangles $T_1$ and $T_2$ at these vertices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are gathered together at the vertex $p$ on the torus.\n\nLet's list the angles that contribute to the sum $\\sum \\theta_i(p)$:\n- The three interior angles of triangle $T_1$, located at vertices $0$, $u$, and $u+v$.\n- The three interior angles of triangle $T_2$, located at vertices $0$, $v$, and $u+v$.\n\nSince the metric on the torus is inherited from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the triangles $T_1$ and $T_2$ are Euclidean triangles. A fundamental property of Euclidean geometry is that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is exactly $\\pi$ radians.\n\n- The sum of the angles of $T_1$ is $\\pi$.\n- The sum of the angles of $T_2$ is $\\pi$.\n\nThe total sum of angles meeting at the vertex $p$ is the sum of all angles of $T_1$ and all angles of $T_2$:\n$$ \\sum \\theta_i(p) = (\\text{sum of angles in } T_1) + (\\text{sum of angles in } T_2) = \\pi + \\pi = 2\\pi $$\n\nNow, we can compute the discrete curvature at vertex $p$:\n$$ K(p) = 2\\pi - \\sum \\theta_i(p) = 2\\pi - 2\\pi = 0 $$\n\nThe final step is to compute the total discrete curvature, which is the sum of the curvatures over all vertices of the triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$. Since there is only one vertex $p$, this sum is simply $K(p)$.\n$$ \\sum_{q \\in V_{\\mathcal{T}}} K(q) = K(p) = 0 $$\n\nThis result is independent of the specific geometric shape of the fundamental parallelogram, i.e., it holds for any choice of linearly independent vectors $u$ and $v$. The calculation confirms the discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which for the torus with Euler characteristic $\\chi(T^2)=0$ predicts a total curvature of $2\\pi \\chi(T^2) = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2997419"}]}
