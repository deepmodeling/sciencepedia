The points $(x, y, z)$ on the cone satisfy the equation $z = \\lambda\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$, where $\\lambda > 0$ is a constant. We are tasked with constructing a suitable parametrization, computing the rank of its differential, and identifying the parameter value corresponding to the singular point of the cone.\n\n**1. Construction of the Parametrization**\n\nTo construct a parametrization that respects the rotational symmetry about the $z$-axis, we use a coordinate system analogous to cylindrical coordinates. Let the parameter $u$ represent the radial distance from the $z$-axis in the $xy$-plane, i.e., $u = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. Let the parameter $v$ be the angle in the $xy$-plane, measured from the positive $x$-axis.\n\nThe standard relationships are:\n$x = u \\cos(v)$\n$y = u \\sin(v)$\n\nSubstituting $u = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ into the cone's equation gives $z = \\lambda u$. We must define the domain for the parameters $(u,v)$. To cover the entire cone, $u$ must range from $0$ (for the apex) to infinity. Thus, we define $u \\in [0, \\infty)$. The angle $v$ must cover a full circle, so we define $v \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThis yields the parametrization $X: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the parameter domain is $U = [0, \\infty) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$ and the map $X$ is given by:\n$$X(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v)) = (u \\cos(v), u \\sin(v), \\lambda u)$$\nThe component functions of $X(u,v)$ are constructed from polynomials, trigonometric functions, and constants. These functions are infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) on their entire domains. Therefore, the map $X$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ map.\n\n**2. Computation of the Differential $dX$ and its Rank**\n\nA point on a parametrized surface is regular if the differential map $dX$ at that point is injective, which for a surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ means its rank is $2$. The rank of $dX$ is the dimension of the image of the map, which is spanned by the partial derivative vectors $X_u = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial u}$ and $X_v = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial v}$. The rank is $2$ if and only if these two vectors are linearly independent.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative vectors:\n$$X_u(u,v) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (u \\cos(v), u \\sin(v), \\lambda u) = (\\cos(v), \\sin(v), \\lambda)$$\n$$X_v(u,v) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} (u \\cos(v), u \\sin(v), \\lambda u) = (-u \\sin(v), u \\cos(v), 0)$$\n\nThe matrix of the differential $dX$ (the Jacobian matrix) with respect to the standard basis is formed by these column vectors:\n$$dX_{(u,v)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(v) & -u \\sin(v) \\\\ \\sin(v) & u \\cos(v) \\\\ \\lambda & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nTo determine where the vectors $X_u$ and $X_v$ are linearly independent, we compute their cross product. The vectors are linearly independent if and only if their cross product is non-zero.\n$$X_u \\times X_v = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ \\cos(v) & \\sin(v) & \\lambda \\\\ -u \\sin(v) & u \\cos(v) & 0 \\end{vmatrix}$$\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n$$X_u \\times X_v = \\mathbf{i} ((\\sin(v))(0) - (\\lambda)(u \\cos(v))) - \\mathbf{j} ((\\cos(v))(0) - (\\lambda)(-u \\sin(v))) + \\mathbf{k} ((\\cos(v))(u \\cos(v)) - (\\sin(v))(-u \\sin(v)))$$\n$$X_u \\times X_v = (-\\lambda u \\cos(v)) \\mathbf{i} - (\\lambda u \\sin(v)) \\mathbf{j} + (u (\\cos^{2}(v) + \\sin^{2}(v))) \\mathbf{k}$$\n$$X_u \\times X_v = (-\\lambda u \\cos(v), -\\lambda u \\sin(v), u)$$\n\nThe rank of $dX$ is $2$ if $X_u \\times X_v \\neq (0, 0, 0)$. The rank drops below $2$ if $X_u \\times X_v = (0, 0, 0)$. This condition requires:\n1. $-\\lambda u \\cos(v) = 0$\n2. $-\\lambda u \\sin(v) = 0$\n3. $u = 0$\n\nSince $\\lambda > 0$ is a given, the first two equations are satisfied if and only if $u=0$ or, for $u \\neq 0$, if both $\\cos(v)=0$ and $\\sin(v)=0$, which is impossible. Therefore, the sole condition that makes the cross product vanish is $u=0$.\n\n**3. Identification of the Singular Point**\n\nThe rank of the differential $dX$ drops from $2$ only when $u=0$.\n- For any parameter value $(u,v)$ with $u > 0$, the cross product $X_u \\times X_v$ is non-zero. This implies that $X_u$ and $X_v$ are linearly independent, so the rank of $dX$ is $2$. These correspond to the regular points of the cone.\n- For the parameter value $u=0$, the cross product is $X_u \\times X_v = (0, 0, 0)$. At $u=0$, the partial derivative vectors are:\n$$X_u(0,v) = (\\cos(v), \\sin(v), \\lambda)$$\n$$X_v(0,v) = (0, 0, 0)$$\nThe set of vectors $\\{X_u, X_v\\}$ is linearly dependent because $X_v$ is the zero vector. The vector $X_u$ is non-zero for any $v$ because $\\lambda > 0$. Therefore, the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{X_u(0,v), X_v(0,v)\\}$ is $1$. This confirms that the rank of $dX$ at any point $(0,v)$ is $1$.\n\nThe unique parameter value common to all points in the parameter domain where the rank of $dX$ drops from $2$ to $1$ is $u=0$. This corresponds to the point $X(0,v) = (0, 0, 0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which is the apex of the cone. This failure of the rank condition is precisely why the apex is a singular point and the cone is not a regular surface in its entirety.\n\nThe problem asks for the single parameter value at which the rank drops. This value is $u=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2988476"}, {"introduction": "While the regularity of a surface is defined by a local condition on its parametrization, the global behavior of the surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ introduces further subtleties.

An immersion is a smooth map whose differential $dX_{(u,v)}$ has rank $2$ for all $(u,v)$ in its domain.

Since $1+u^{2}+v^{2} \\ge 1$ for all real $u,v$, this implies $u=0$.\nFrom the second component, $2v(1+u^{2}+v^{2}) = 0$. This implies $v=0$.\nIf we substitute $u=0$ and $v=0$ into the third component, we get $1-(0^{2}+0^{2})^{2} = 1$.\nSince the third component is not zero when the first two are zero, the cross product $X_{u} \\times X_{v}$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, the vectors $X_{u}$ and $X_{v}$ are linearly independent for all $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. This proves that the differential $dX_{(u,v)}$ has rank $2$ everywhere, and thus $X$ is an immersion.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must find distinct points $(u_{1},v_{1})$ and $(u_{2},v_{2})$ such that $X(u_{1},v_{1}) = X(u_{2},v_{2})$, and show that the image $S=X(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ is not a regular surface.\nLet's analyze the components of $X$: $x = u(1 - u^{2}/3 + v^{2})$, $y = v(1 - v^{2}/3 + u^{2})$, $z = u^{2}-v^{2}$.\nLet's test simple parameter values. Consider $(u_{1},v_{1}) = (\\sqrt{3}, 0)$.\n$$\nX(\\sqrt{3}, 0) = \\left(\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{(\\sqrt{3})^{3}}{3} + 0, \\; 0, \\; (\\sqrt{3})^{2}-0^{2}\\right) = \\left(\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3}, \\; 0, \\; 3\\right) = (0, 0, 3).\n$$\nNow consider a distinct point $(u_{2},v_{2}) = (-\\sqrt{3}, 0)$.\n$$\nX(-\\sqrt{3}, 0) = \\left(-\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{(-\\sqrt{3})^{3}}{3} + 0, \\; 0, \\; (-\\sqrt{3})^{2}-0^{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\sqrt{3}+\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3}, \\; 0, \\; 3\\right) = (0, 0, 3).\n$$\nWe have found a point of self-intersection $p = (0,0,3)$, which is the image of two distinct points in the parameter domain, $q_1 = (\\sqrt{3}, 0)$ and $q_2 = (-\\sqrt{3}, 0)$.\n\nNext, we show that the tangent planes at $p$ corresponding to these two pre-images are distinct. The tangent plane is spanned by $X_{u}$ and $X_{v}$. A normal vector to the plane is given by $X_{u} \\times X_{v}$.\nAt $q_{1} = (\\sqrt{3}, 0)$:\n$X_{u}(\\sqrt{3}, 0) = (1-3+0, 0, 2\\sqrt{3}) = (-2, 0, 2\\sqrt{3})$.\n$X_{v}(\\sqrt{3}, 0) = (0, 1+3-0, 0) = (0, 4, 0)$.\nThe normal vector $N_{1}$ is proportional to their cross product:\n$N_{1} \\propto (-2, 0, 2\\sqrt{3}) \\times (0, 4, 0) = (-8\\sqrt{3}, 0, -8)$. We can use the simpler parallel vector $(\\sqrt{3}, 0, 1)$.\n\nAt $q_{2} = (-\\sqrt{3}, 0)$:\n$X_{u}(-\\sqrt{3}, 0) = (1-3+0, 0, -2\\sqrt{3}) = (-2, 0, -2\\sqrt{3})$.\n$X_{v}(-\\sqrt{3}, 0) = (0, 1+3-0, 0) = (0, 4, 0)$.\nThe normal vector $N_{2}$ is proportional to their cross product:\n$N_{2} \\propto (-2, 0, -2\\sqrt{3}) \\times (0, 4, 0) = (8\\sqrt{3}, 0, -8)$. We can use the simpler parallel vector $(-\\sqrt{3}, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe normal vectors $N_{1} \\propto (\\sqrt{3}, 0, 1)$ and $N_{2} \\propto (-\\sqrt{3}, 0, 1)$ are not parallel. Therefore, the tangent planes at $p=(0,0,3)$ corresponding to the pre-images $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are distinct.\n\nThis self-intersection with distinct tangent planes implies that the image $S = X(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ is not a regular surface subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We argue from first principles.\nThe definition of a regular surface $S$ requires that for every point $p\\in S$, there exists an open set $U\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $p\\in U$ and a parametrization $\\phi:V\\to U\\cap S$ (where $V\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is open) that is a homeomorphism. A homeomorphism is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse.\nLet's assume, for contradiction, that $S$ is a regular surface. Let $p = (0,0,3) \\in S$. Then there must exist such a homeomorphism $\\phi:V\\to U\\cap S$ for some open sets $U$ and $V$.\nLet $r = \\phi^{-1}(p) \\in V$. Since $V$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, removing a single point leaves the set connected. That is, $V \\setminus \\{r\\}$ is a connected set. Since $\\phi$ is a homeomorphism, it must map connected sets to connected sets. Thus, its image $\\phi(V \\setminus \\{r\\}) = (U \\cap S) \\setminus \\{p\\}$ must be a connected set.\nHowever, we can show that for any sufficiently small neighborhood $U$ of $p$, the set $(U \\cap S) \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is disconnected. Near the point $p$, the surface $S$ consists of two \"sheets\" intersecting at $p$. One sheet comes from a neighborhood of $q_{1}=(\\sqrt{3},0)$ and the other from a neighborhood of $q_{2}=(-\\sqrt{3},0)$. Let $W_{1}$ be a small open disk around $q_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ be a small open disk around $q_{2}$, chosen such that $W_{1} \\cap W_{2} = \\emptyset$. Since $X$ is an immersion, it is a local homeomorphism. Thus, $S_{1} = X(W_{1})$ and $S_{2} = X(W_{2})$ are two small surface patches. In a sufficiently small open ball $U$ centered at $p$, the intersection $S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap U$ consists only of the point $p$. Thus, the set $(U \\cap S) \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets, $(S_{1} \\cap U) \\setminus \\{p\\}$ and $(S_{2} \\cap U) \\setminus \\{p\\}$, and is therefore disconnected.\nThis contradicts the fact that $(U \\cap S) \\setminus \\{p\\}$ must be connected. The assumption that $S$ is a regular surface must be false.\n\nFor the third part, we compute the Gaussian curvature $K$ at the origin of the parameter domain, $(u,v)=(0,0)$. The corresponding point on the surface is $X(0,0)=(0,0,0)$.\nThe Gaussian curvature is given by $K = \\frac{eg-f^{2}}{EG-F^{2}}$, where $E,F,G$ are the coefficients of the first fundamental form and $e,f,g$ are the coefficients of the second fundamental form.\n\nFirst fundamental form coefficients at $(u,v)=(0,0)$:\n$X_{u}(0,0) = (1,0,0)$\n$X_{v}(0,0) = (0,1,0)$\n$E(0,0) = \\langle X_{u}, X_{u} \\rangle|_{(0,0)} = \\langle(1,0,0), (1,0,0)\\rangle = 1$.\n$F(0,0) = \\langle X_{u}, X_{v} \\rangle|_{(0,0)} = \\langle(1,0,0), (0,1,0)\\rangle = 0$.\n$G(0,0) = \\langle X_{v}, X_{v} \\rangle|_{(0,0)} = \\langle(0,1,0), (0,1,0)\\rangle = 1$.\nThus, $EG-F^{2}|_{(0,0)} = 1 \\cdot 1 - 0^{2} = 1$.\n\nSecond fundamental form coefficients at $(u,v)=(0,0)$:\nWe need the second partial derivatives of $X(u,v)$:\n$X_{uu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(1-u^{2}+v^{2}, 2uv, 2u) = (-2u, 2v, 2)$.\n$X_{uv} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(1-u^{2}+v^{2}, 2uv, 2u) = (2v, 2u, 0)$.\n$X_{vv} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(2uv, 1+u^{2}-v^{2}, -2v) = (2u, -2v, -2)$.\nEvaluating at $(u,v)=(0,0)$:\n$X_{uu}(0,0) = (0,0,2)$.\n$X_{uv}(0,0) = (0,0,0)$.\n$X_{vv}(0,0) = (0,0,-2)$.\n\nThe unit normal vector $N$ at $(0,0)$ is:\n$N(0,0) = \\frac{X_{u}(0,0) \\times X_{v}(0,0)}{\\|X_{u}(0,0) \\times X_{v}(0,0)\\|} = \\frac{(1,0,0) \\times (0,1,0)}{\\|(1,0,0) \\times (0,1,0)\\|} = \\frac{(0,0,1)}{\\|(0,0,1)\\|} = (0,0,1)$.\n\nNow we compute $e,f,g$ at $(0,0)$:\n$e(0,0) = \\langle X_{uu}(0,0), N(0,0) \\rangle = \\langle (0,0,2), (0,0,1) \\rangle = 2$.\n$f(0,0) = \\langle X_{uv}(0,0), N(0,0) \\rangle = \\langle (0,0,0), (0,0,1) \\rangle = 0$.\n$g(0,0) = \\langle X_{vv}(0,0), N(0,0) \\rangle = \\langle (0,0,-2), (0,0,1) \\rangle = -2$.\n\nFinally, the Gaussian curvature at $(u,v)=(0,0)$ is:\n$$\nK(0,0) = \\frac{e(0,0)g(0,0) - f(0,0)^{2}}{E(0,0)G(0,0) - F(0,0)^{2}} = \\frac{(2)(-2) - 0^{2}}{1 \\cdot 1 - 0^{2}} = \\frac{-4}{1} = -4.\n$$\nThe value of the Gaussian curvature at the origin of the parameter domain is $-4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-4}$$", "id": "2988403"}, {"introduction": "Once a set is established as a regular surface, we can study its intrinsic geometry—the properties that depend only on measurements made within the surface.

Geodesics are extremals of the energy functional, whose Lagrangian is $L = \\frac{1}{2}g_{ij}\\dot{x}^{i}\\dot{x}^{j}$.\n$$ L(\\theta, \\dot{\\theta}, \\varphi, \\dot{\\varphi}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( g_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + g_{\\varphi\\varphi}\\dot{\\varphi}^{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}R^{2}(\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + \\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi}^{2}) $$\nThe coordinate $\\varphi$ is a cyclic coordinate because the Lagrangian does not depend on it explicitly, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varphi} = 0$. By the Euler-Lagrange equations, this implies that the conjugate momentum $p_{\\varphi}$ is conserved along any geodesic:\n$$ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\varphi}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varphi} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\varphi}}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe conserved quantity is therefore:\n$$ C = p_{\\varphi} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\varphi}} = \\frac{1}{2}R^{2}(2\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi}) = R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi} $$\nThis is the first integral associated with the rotational symmetry of the sphere.\n\nFinally, we express this quantity $C$ in terms of $R$, $\\theta$, and the angle $\\alpha$. We are given a unit-speed geodesic, so $s$ is arc length and the tangent vector $v = \\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}\\partial_{\\varphi}$ has unit norm, i.e., $g(v,v)=1$.\n$$ g(v,v) = R^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi}^{2} = 1 $$\nThe meridian direction corresponds to curves with fixed $\\varphi$, so its tangent vector is in the direction of $u = \\partial_{\\theta}$. The squared norm of this vector is $\\|u\\|^{2} = g(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\theta}) = R^{2}$, so $\\|u\\|=R$.\nThe angle $\\alpha$ between the geodesic tangent $v$ and the meridian direction vector $u$ is given by the dot product formula:\n$$ \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{g(v, u)}{\\|v\\| \\|u\\|} $$\nThe inner product is $g(v, u) = g(\\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}\\partial_{\\varphi}, \\partial_{\\theta}) = \\dot{\\theta}g_{\\theta\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}g_{\\varphi\\theta} = \\dot{\\theta}R^{2}$.\nSubstituting into the angle formula:\n$$ \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{\\dot{\\theta}R^{2}}{1 \\cdot R} = R\\dot{\\theta} $$\nTo relate $\\dot{\\varphi}$ to $\\alpha$, we interpret $\\alpha$ as the oriented angle from the normalized meridian direction to the tangent vector $v$. An orthonormal basis for the tangent plane is $\\{e_{\\theta}, e_{\\varphi}\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{R}\\partial_{\\theta}, \\frac{1}{R\\sin\\theta}\\partial_{\\varphi}\\}$. The unit tangent vector $v$ can be expressed as $v = (\\cos\\alpha) e_{\\theta} + (\\sin\\alpha) e_{\\varphi}$.\nWe also have $v = \\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}\\partial_{\\varphi} = (R\\dot{\\theta})e_{\\theta} + (R\\sin\\theta \\dot{\\varphi})e_{\\varphi}$.\nComparing the coefficients of $e_{\\varphi}$ gives:\n$$ R\\sin\\theta\\dot{\\varphi} = \\sin\\alpha \\implies \\dot{\\varphi} = \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{R\\sin\\theta} $$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\dot{\\varphi}$ into the formula for the conserved quantity $C$:\n$$ C = R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi} = R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{R\\sin\\theta} \\right) = R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\alpha $$\nThis result, known as Clairaut's relation, expresses the conserved angular momentum about the axis of rotation in terms of the position ($\\theta$) and the direction of the geodesic ($\\alpha$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\alpha}$$", "id": "2988400"}]}
