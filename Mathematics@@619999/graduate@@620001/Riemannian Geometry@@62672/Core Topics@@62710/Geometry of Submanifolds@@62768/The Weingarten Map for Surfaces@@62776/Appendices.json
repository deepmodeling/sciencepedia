It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the explicit form of the Weingarten map (or shape operator) $S_p$ for the unit sphere $S^2 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$. We are given all the necessary definitions to derive this operator.\n\nLet $S^2 = \\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : \\|p\\| = 1 \\}$, where $\\| \\cdot \\|$ is the standard Euclidean norm. The tangent space at a point $p \\in S^2$, denoted $T_pS^2$, is the set of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ orthogonal to $p$. That is, $T_pS^2 = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : \\langle v, p \\rangle = 0 \\}$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the Euclidean inner product.\n\nThe Gauss map $N: S^2 \\to S^2$ maps a point $p$ on the sphere to its outward-pointing unit normal vector. For the unit sphere, the position vector $p$ itself serves as the outward-pointing unit normal vector. Thus, the problem correctly states that the Gauss map is given by the identity function on the points of the sphere:\n$$N(p) = p$$\nThis means that the Gauss map, as a map from the manifold $S^2$ to itself, is the identity map, $N = \\text{id}_{S^2}$.\n\nThe Weingarten map $S_p: T_pS^2 \\to T_pS^2$ is defined in the problem by the relation $S_p(v) = -dN_p(v)$, where $dN_p$ is the differential of the Gauss map $N$ at the point $p \\in S^2$.\n\nTo compute the differential of a map between manifolds, we can consider its action on tangent vectors. A tangent vector $v \\in T_pS^2$ is the velocity vector of some smooth curve $\\gamma: (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\to S^2$ at $t=0$, such that $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma'(0) = v$.\n\nThe differential $dN_p$ applied to the vector $v$ is defined as the derivative of the composition of the map $N$ with the curve $\\gamma$:\n$$dN_p(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (N \\circ \\gamma)(t)$$\nSince the map $N$ is given by $N(p)=p$, its composition with the curve $\\gamma(t)$ is:\n$$(N \\circ \\gamma)(t) = N(\\gamma(t)) = \\gamma(t)$$\nSubstituting this back into the definition of the differential, we get:\n$$dN_p(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\gamma(t)$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t)$ evaluated at $t=0$ is precisely the tangent vector $\\gamma'(0)$, which is $v$.\n$$dN_p(v) = \\gamma'(0) = v$$\nAccording to the problem's definition, $S_p(v) = -dN_p(v)$. Therefore, we have:\n$$S_p(v) = -v$$\nThis equation holds for any tangent vector $v \\in T_pS^2$. This signifies that the Weingarten map $S_p$ is the negative of the identity operator on the tangent space $T_pS^2$. We denote the identity operator by $I$. Thus, for any point $p \\in S^2$:\n$$S_p = -I$$\n\nThe principal curvatures at a point $p$ are the eigenvalues of the Weingarten map $S_p$. Since $S_p = -I$, the eigenvalue equation is $S_p(v) = \\lambda v$, which becomes $-I(v) = \\lambda v$, or $-v = \\lambda v$. For any non-zero vector $v \\in T_pS^2$, this equation is satisfied only if $\\lambda = -1$. The tangent space $T_pS^2$ is a $2$-dimensional vector space. The operator $-I$ on a $2$-dimensional space has the eigenvalue $-1$ with algebraic multiplicity $2$.\nTherefore, both principal curvatures are equal to $-1$: $k_1 = k_2 = -1$.\n\nThis sign is geometrically intuitive: for an outward-pointing normal vector $N$, the surface bends *away* from the normal, which corresponds to a negative curvature in this convention.

The helicoid is a minimal surface. This result can also be obtained directly from the trace of the shape operator matrix with respect to an orthonormal basis, but since $\\{X_u, X_v\\}$ is not orthonormal, we must use the eigenvalues. The trace of the matrix $[S]$ is 0, and since the mean curvature is half the trace of the operator $S$, this also confirms $H=0$.\n\nFinally, we verify that the principal curvatures have opposite signs.\nWe are given $a>0$.
