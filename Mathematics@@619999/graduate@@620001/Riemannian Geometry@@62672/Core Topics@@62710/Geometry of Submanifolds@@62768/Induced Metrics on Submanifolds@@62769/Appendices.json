It presents a standard problem in Riemannian geometry that is free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the total area of a $2$-dimensional submanifold, the Clifford torus $T$, embedded in the $3$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^3$, which itself is a submanifold of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The area is to be computed with respect to the Riemannian metric on $T$ induced from the metric on $\\mathbb{S}^3$.\n\nLet $g_{\\mathbb{R}^4}$ be the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The sphere $\\mathbb{S}^3$ is defined as the set of points $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 : \\|x\\| = 1\\}$. The metric on $\\mathbb{S}^3$, let us call it $g_{\\mathbb{S}^3}$, is the metric induced by the inclusion map $j: \\mathbb{S}^3 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^4$. That is, $g_{\\mathbb{S}^3} = j^*g_{\\mathbb{R}^4}$.\n\nThe Clifford torus $T$ is a submanifold of $\\mathbb{S}^3$. Its metric, $g_T$, is induced by the inclusion map $i: T \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{S}^3$. Thus, $g_T = i^*g_{\\mathbb{S}^3}$. By the properties of the pullback, we have $g_T = i^*(j^*g_{\\mathbb{R}^4}) = (j \\circ i)^*g_{\\mathbb{R}^4}$. The composition $j \\circ i: T \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^4$ is simply the inclusion of the torus $T$ into the ambient Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Therefore, the metric on $T$ can be computed directly by pulling back the Euclidean metric from $\\mathbb{R}^4$. This simplifies the procedure significantly.\n\nThe Clifford torus $T$ is given by the parametrization $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{S}^3$. We shall consider this as a map into $\\mathbb{R}^4$, which we denote by $\\Psi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$, where\n$$\n\\Psi(\\theta,\\varphi) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big(\\cos\\theta,\\,\\sin\\theta,\\,\\cos\\varphi,\\,\\sin\\varphi\\big).\n$$\nThe parameters $(\\theta, \\varphi)$ are local coordinates on the torus. To cover the entire torus once, the standard domain for these parameters is taken as $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nTo find the components of the induced metric tensor $g$ on $T$ in these coordinates, we first compute the tangent vectors to the torus.

This requires the differential map $dF_{p}$ to have maximal rank, which is $2$. The Jacobian matrix of $F$ is\n$$\ndF_x = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F^{1}}{\\partial x_{1}} & \\frac{\\partial F^{1}}{\\partial x_{2}} & \\frac{\\partial F^{1}}{\\partial x_{3}} & \\frac{\\partial F^{1}}{\\partial x_{4}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial F^{2}}{\\partial x_{1}} & \\frac{\\partial F^{2}}{\\partial x_{2}} & \\frac{\\partial F^{2}}{\\partial x_{3}} & \\frac{\\partial F^{2}}{\\partial x_{4}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince the entries of this matrix are constant, $dF_p$ is the same for all points $p$. To check its rank, we can find a $2 \\times 2$ submatrix with a non-zero determinant. The submatrix formed by the first two columns has determinant $(1)(-1) - (1)(2) = -3 \\neq 0$. Thus, the rank of $dF_p$ is $2$, and $p$ is a regular point.\n\nBy the Implicit Function Theorem, because the submatrix of the Jacobian corresponding to the variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ is invertible, we can locally express $x_1$ and $x_2$ as smooth functions of the remaining variables, $x_3$ and $x_4$. This justifies using $(u,v) = (x_3,x_4)$ as local coordinates for $S$ in a neighborhood of $p$. The local parametrization is given by a map $\\varphi(u,v) = (x_{1}(u,v), x_{2}(u,v), u, v)$. The tangent space $T_p S$ is spanned by the vectors $\\partial_u \\varphi$ and $\\partial_v \\varphi$ evaluated at the point $p$, which corresponds to $(u,v)=(0,-2)$.\n\nTo find these basis vectors, we differentiate the defining equations of $S$ with respect to the local coordinates $u$ and $v$.\nThe equations are:\n$x_{1}(u,v) + x_{2}(u,v) + u - 1 = 0$\n$2x_{1}(u,v) - x_{2}(u,v) + v = 0$\n\nDifferentiating with respect to $u$:\n$\\frac{\\partial x_{1}}{\\partial u} + \\frac{\\partial x_{2}}{\\partial u} + 1 = 0$\n$2\\frac{\\partial x_{1}}{\\partial u} - \\frac{\\partial x_{2}}{\\partial u} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial x_{2}}{\\partial u} = 2\\frac{\\partial x_{1}}{\\partial u}$\nSubstituting the second result into the first yields $3\\frac{\\partial x_{1}}{\\partial u} + 1 = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial x_{1}}{\\partial u} = -\\frac{1}{3}$.

The matrix representation of this metric is:\n$$ [\\tilde{g}] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\tilde{g}_{\\theta\\theta} & \\tilde{g}_{\\theta\\varphi} \\\\ \\tilde{g}_{\\varphi\\theta} & \\tilde{g}_{\\varphi\\varphi} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} R_1^2 + p^2 r^2 & pqr^2 \\\\ pqr^2 & R_2^2 + q^2 r^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we compute the area element $d A$ for the graph submanifold. The area element is given by $\\sqrt{\\det([\\tilde{g}])} \\, d\\theta \\wedge d\\varphi$. We calculate the determinant of the metric matrix:\n$$ \\det([\\tilde{g}]) = (R_1^2 + p^2 r^2)(R_2^2 + q^2 r^2) - (pqr^2)^2 $$\n$$ = (R_1^2 R_2^2 + R_1^2 q^2 r^2 + p^2 r^2 R_2^2 + p^2 q^2 r^4) - p^2 q^2 r^4 $$\n$$ = R_1^2 R_2^2 + p^2 r^2 R_2^2 + q^2 r^2 R_1^2 $$\nThe area element is therefore:\n$$ d A = \\sqrt{R_1^2 R_2^2 + p^2 r^2 R_2^2 + q^2 r^2 R_1^2} \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi $$\n\nFinally, to find the total area of the graph submanifold $\\Gamma_F(M)$, we integrate the area element $d A$ over the domain of the coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$. Since $M$ is a torus with coordinates defined modulo $2\\pi$, the integration domain is $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ and $\\varphi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n$$ \\text{Area}(\\Gamma_F(M)) = \\int_M d A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{R_1^2 R_2^2 + p^2 r^2 R_2^2 + q^2 r^2 R_1^2} \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi $$\nThe integrand is a constant with respect to the integration variables $\\theta$ and $\\varphi$. We can therefore pull it out of the integral:\n$$ \\text{Area}(\\Gamma_F(M)) = \\sqrt{R_1^2 R_2^2 + p^2 r^2 R_2^2 + q^2 r^2 R_1^2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\, d\\varphi $$\nThe remaining double integral is the area of the parameter domain:\n$$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi = (2\\pi)(2\\pi) = 4\\pi^2 $$\nThus, the total area of the graph is:\n$$ \\text{Area}(\\Gamma_F(M)) = 4\\pi^2 \\sqrt{R_1^2 R_2^2 + p^2 r^2 R_2^2 + q^2 r^2 R_1^2} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the area as a function of the given constants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi^2 \\sqrt{R_1^2 R_2^2 + p^2 r^2 R_2^2 + q^2 r^2 R_1^2}}$$", "id": "2980772"}]}
