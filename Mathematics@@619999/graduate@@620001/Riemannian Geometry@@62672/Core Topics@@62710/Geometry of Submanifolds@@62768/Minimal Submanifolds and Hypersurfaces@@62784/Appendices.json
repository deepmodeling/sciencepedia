The analysis will be conducted for each hypersurface separately, using the provided definitions.\n\nLet the ambient space be $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ with its standard Euclidean metric, denoted by the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$. The ambient connection $D$ is the standard directional derivative of vector fields. For a hypersurface $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ with a chosen unit normal vector field $\\nu$, the shape operator $S_p: T_pM \\to T_pM$ at a point $p \\in M$ is defined by $S_p(v) = -D_v\\nu$ for any tangent vector $v \\in T_pM$.\n\n**Part 1: The $m$-sphere $S^m(R)$**\n\nThe $m$-sphere of radius $R > 0$ centered at the origin is the set of points $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ such that $|p|^2 = R^2$.\n\n1.  **Unit Normal Field**: At any point $p \\in S^m(R)$, the position vector $p$ is orthogonal to the tangent space $T_pS^m(R)$. The outward-pointing unit normal vector $\\nu(p)$ is therefore given by normalizing the position vector:\n    $$ \\nu(p) = \\frac{p}{R} $$\n    We can extend this to a vector field on $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ as $\\nu(q) = q/R$ for any $q \\neq 0$.\n\n2.  **Shape Operator**: To compute the shape operator $S$, we take its action on an arbitrary tangent vector $v \\in T_pS^m(R)$. According to the definition, $S(v) = -D_v\\nu$. Since the ambient connection $D$ is the standard directional derivative in Euclidean space, we have:\n    $$ D_v\\nu = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\nu(p+hv) - \\nu(p)}{h} $$\n    Because $p$ is a point on the sphere and $v$ is a tangent vector at $p$, the path $p+hv$ is a line in the ambient space. Using the extension of $\\nu$, we get:\n    $$ D_v\\nu = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu(p+tv) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\frac{p+tv}{R} = \\frac{v}{R} $$\n    Thus, the action of the shape operator on any tangent vector $v$ is:\n    $$ S(v) = -D_v\\nu = -\\frac{v}{R} $$\n    This equation shows that the shape operator $S$ at any point $p \\in S^m(R)$ is simply a scalar multiple of the identity map on the tangent space $T_pS^m(R)$:\n    $$ S = -\\frac{1}{R} I $$\n\n3.  **Principal Curvatures**: The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator $S$. Since $S$ is $-\\frac{1}{R}$ times the identity on the $m$-dimensional tangent space, any non-zero tangent vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $-\\frac{1}{R}$. Therefore, all $m$ principal curvatures are equal:\n    $$ \\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2 = \\dots = \\kappa_m = -\\frac{1}{R} $$\n\n4.  **Scalar Mean Curvature ($H$)**: The mean curvature is defined as the average of the principal curvatures:\n    $$ H = \\frac{1}{m}\\operatorname{tr}(S) = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\kappa_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( m \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{R} $$\n\n5.  **Gauss–Kronecker Curvature ($K$)**: The Gauss–Kronecker curvature is the determinant of the shape operator, which is the product of the principal curvatures:\n    $$ K = \\det(S) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\kappa_i = \\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^m = \\frac{(-1)^m}{R^m} $$\n\n**Part 2: The Generalized Cylinder $S^{m-1}(R) \\times \\mathbb{R}$**\n\nThe generalized cylinder is the set of points $p = (x,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m \\times \\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ such that $|x|=R$.\n\n1.  **Unit Normal Field**: The defining condition $|x|=R$ only concerns the first $m$ coordinates. The outward-pointing normal vector at a point $p=(x,t)$ will be in the direction of $x$ within the $\\mathbb{R}^m$ subspace and have no component in the $\\mathbb{R}$ direction (the $(m+1)$-th coordinate). The unit normal is:\n    $$ \\nu(p) = \\nu(x,t) = \\left(\\frac{x}{R}, 0\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Shape Operator**: The tangent space $T_p(S^{m-1}(R) \\times \\mathbb{R})$ at $p=(x,t)$ can be decomposed. A vector $v = (v_x, v_t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is tangent to the cylinder if $\\langle v_x, x \\rangle = 0$. The tangent space is spanned by $m-1$ vectors of the form $(v_x, 0)$ where $\\langle v_x, x \\rangle=0$, and one vector of the form $(0,1)$.\n\n    Let's compute $S(v) = -D_v\\nu$ for an arbitrary tangent vector $v = (v_x, v_t)$. The vector field $\\nu$ only depends on the $x$ coordinates.\n    $$ D_v\\nu = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\nu(p+sv) = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\nu(x+sv_x, t+sv_t) $$\n    Using the definition of the normal field:\n    $$ D_v\\nu = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\left( \\frac{x+sv_x}{R}, 0 \\right) = \\left( \\frac{v_x}{R}, 0 \\right) $$\n    The shape operator is therefore:\n    $$ S(v) = -D_v\\nu = \\left( -\\frac{v_x}{R}, 0 \\right) $$\n\n3.  **Principal Curvatures**: Let's find the eigenvalues of $S$ by testing it on basis vectors of the tangent space.\n    -   Consider a basis of $m-1$ orthonormal vectors $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_{m-1}\\}$ for the tangent space of the $S^{m-1}$ factor at $x$. These can be viewed as vectors $v_i = (e_i, 0)$ in $T_p(S^{m-1}(R) \\times \\mathbb{R})$. For such a vector, $v_x = e_i$ and $v_t=0$. The action of $S$ is:\n        $$ S(v_i) = \\left( -\\frac{e_i}{R}, 0 \\right) = -\\frac{1}{R} (e_i, 0) = -\\frac{1}{R} v_i $$\n        These $m-1$ vectors are eigenvectors with eigenvalue $-\\frac{1}{R}$. So, $\\kappa_1 = \\dots = \\kappa_{m-1} = -\\frac{1}{R}$.\n    -   Consider the vector tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor, $v_m = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$. For this vector, $v_x=0$ and $v_t=1$. The action of $S$ is:\n        $$ S(v_m) = \\left( -\\frac{0}{R}, 0 \\right) = (0,0) = 0 \\cdot v_m $$\n        This vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $0$. So, $\\kappa_m = 0$.\n    The principal curvatures are $-\\frac{1}{R}$ with multiplicity $m-1$, and $0$ with multiplicity $1$.\n\n4.  **Scalar Mean Curvature ($H$)**:\n    $$ H = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\kappa_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( (m-1)\\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right) + 0 \\right) = -\\frac{m-1}{mR} $$\n\n5.  **Gauss–Kronecker Curvature ($K$)**:\n    $$ K = \\det(S) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\kappa_i = \\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^{m-1} \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n\nThe final answer will be structured as a single row matrix containing $2m+4$ entries, corresponding to the sequence of quantities requested: the $m$ principal curvatures for the sphere, its mean and Gauss-Kronecker curvatures, followed by the $m$ principal curvatures for the cylinder, and its mean and Gauss-Kronecker curvatures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{R} & \\dots & -\\frac{1}{R}}_{m} & -\\frac{1}{R} & \\frac{(-1)^m}{R^m} & \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{R} & \\dots & -\\frac{1}{R}}_{m-1} & 0 & -\\frac{m-1}{mR} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2984400"}, {"introduction": "Having practiced calculating curvature, we now move from verification to derivation.

Since $p$ is a regular point, $\\Sigma$ admits a unique tangent hyperplane at $p$, which we denote by $T_p\\Sigma$. By applying an appropriate isometry (a rotation and a translation) to $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, we can situate the point $p$ at the origin, $p = (0, \\dots, 0)$, and align its tangent plane $T_p\\Sigma$ with the coordinate hyperplane $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1} : x^{m+1} = 0\\}$.

For $x$ near $0$, we have $f(x) = O(|x|^2)$ and $\\nabla f(x) = O(|x|)$.\n\nThe problem defines the density as:\n$$\n\\theta^{m}(\\Sigma,p) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(\\Sigma \\cap B_{r}(p)\\big)}{\\omega_{m}\\, r^{m}}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(\\Sigma \\cap B_{r}(p)\\big)$ is the $m$-dimensional area of the portion of $\\Sigma$ contained within the Euclidean ball $B_r(p)$ of radius $r$ centered at the origin $p$. For a hypersurface given as the graph $x^{m+1} = f(x)$, its $m$-dimensional area element is given by $\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(x)|^2} \\, dV_x$, where $dV_x$ is the standard Lebesgue measure on the domain $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$.\n\nThe region of integration is the part of the graph inside the ball $B_r(p)$, which is defined by $|(x, f(x))|^2  r^2$, or $|x|^2 + (f(x))^2  r^2$. Let us denote the projection of this region onto $\\mathbb{R}^m$ as $D_r$. So, $D_r = \\{x \\in U : |x|^2 + (f(x))^2  r^2 \\}$. The area is thus:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{m}\\big(\\Sigma \\cap B_{r}(p)\\big) = \\int_{D_r} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(x)|^2} \\, dV_x\n$$\nWe need to evaluate the limit:\n$$\n\\theta^{m}(\\Sigma,p) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\omega_{m}\\, r^{m}} \\int_{D_r} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(x)|^2} \\, dV_x\n$$\nTo handle the dependence on $r$ in the integration domain, we perform a change of variables $x = ry$. Then $dV_x = r^m dV_y$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{D_r} \\sqrt{1+|\\nabla f(x)|^2} \\, dV_x = \\int_{\\tilde{D}_r} \\sqrt{1+|\\nabla f(ry)|^2} \\, r^m dV_y\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{D}_r$ is the transformed domain in the $y$-coordinates. The condition $|x|^2 + (f(x))^2  r^2$ becomes $|ry|^2 + (f(ry))^2  r^2$, which simplifies to $|y|^2 + \\frac{(f(ry))^2}{r^2}  1$. So, $\\tilde{D}_r = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : |y|^2 + \\frac{(f(ry))^2}{r^2}  1\\}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for density, the $r^m$ factors cancel:\n$$\n\\theta^{m}(\\Sigma,p) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\omega_{m}} \\int_{\\tilde{D}_r} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(ry)|^2} \\, dV_y\n$$\nLet us now analyze the behavior of the integrand and the domain of integration as $r \\to 0$.\n\nFirst, the domain $\\tilde{D}_r$:\nWe know $f(x) = O(|x|^2)$. Thus, for a fixed $y$, $f(ry) = O(|ry|^2) = O(r^2|y|^2)$.\nThe term $\\frac{(f(ry))^2}{r^2} = \\frac{O(r^4|y|^4)}{r^2} = O(r^2|y|^4)$. As $r \\to 0$, this term vanishes.\nSo, the condition $|y|^2 + O(r^2|y|^4)  1$ approaches $|y|^2  1$. This means the domain $\\tilde{D}_r$ converges to the open unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^m$, denoted $B_1^m(0)$.\n\nSecond, the integrand $\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(ry)|^2}$:\nWe know $\\nabla f(x) = O(|x|)$. Thus, for a fixed $y$, $\\nabla f(ry) = O(|ry|) = O(r|y|)$.\nThen $|\\nabla f(ry)|^2 = O(r^2|y|^2)$, which goes to $0$ as $r \\to 0$.\nTherefore, the integrand converges to $\\sqrt{1+0} = 1$.\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\to 0} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(ry)|^2} = 1\n$$\nThis convergence is uniform for $y$ in any compact set, such as the closed unit ball $\\overline{B_1^m(0)}$. The integrand function is bounded. The domain of integration $\\tilde{D}_r$ is contained within $B_1^m(0)$ for small enough $r$ (since $\\frac{(f(ry))^2}{r^2} \\ge 0$). We can rewrite the expression as an integral over all of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ using a characteristic function $\\chi_{\\tilde{D}_r}(y)$.\n$$\n\\theta^{m}(\\Sigma,p) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{m}} \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^m} \\chi_{\\tilde{D}_r}(y) \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(ry)|^2} \\, dV_y\n$$\nThe integrand function $F_r(y) = \\chi_{\\tilde{D}_r}(y) \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(ry)|^2}$ converges pointwise to $F(y) = \\chi_{B_1^m(0)}(y) \\cdot 1$. The functions $F_r(y)$ are uniformly bounded. By the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral:\n$$\n\\theta^{m}(\\Sigma,p) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{m}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^m} \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left( \\chi_{\\tilde{D}_r}(y) \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla f(ry)|^2} \\right) dV_y = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{m}} \\int_{B_1^m(0)} 1 \\, dV_y\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{B_1^m(0)} 1 \\, dV_y$ is, by definition, the Lebesgue measure (volume) of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^m$, which is denoted by $\\omega_m$.\nFinally, we obtain the value of the density:\n$$\n\\theta^{m}(\\Sigma,p) = \\frac{\\omega_m}{\\omega_m} = 1\n$$\nThis calculation verifies that the limit exists and its value is $1$. The fact that the hypersurface is minimal ensures the required smoothness of $f$ for this argument to be rigorous. The result signifies that at a regular point, a smooth minimal hypersurface is locally very well-approximated by its tangent plane, to the extent that its area density is identical to that of a flat Euclidean space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2984394"}]}
