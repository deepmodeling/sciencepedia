As required, these are functions of $u$, $R$, and $r$ only.\n\nThe problem also requires an analysis of the geometric reason for the value of the off-diagonal coefficient $F$. We found that $F=0$. The coefficient $F$ is defined as the inner product $F = \\langle X_u, X_v \\rangle$. The condition $F=0$ signifies that the tangent vectors to the coordinate curves, $X_u$ and $X_v$, are orthogonal at every point on the surface. Such a coordinate system is called an orthogonal parametrization.\n\nLet's examine the geometry of the coordinate curves on the torus:\n1.  The $u$-curves are obtained by holding $v$ constant (e.g., $v=v_0$). The parametrization becomes $X(u, v_0)$, which traces circles of radius $r$ in vertical planes containing the $z$-axis. These are the meridians of the torus. The vector $X_u$ is tangent to these meridians.\n2.  The $v$-curves are obtained by holding $u$ constant (e.g., $u=u_0$). The parametrization becomes $X(u_0, v)$, which traces circles of radius $\\rho = R+r\\cos u_0$ in horizontal planes (constant $z=r\\sin u_0$). These are the parallels (or latitudes) of the torus. The vector $X_v$ is tangent to these parallels.\n\nThe surface is a surface of revolution, generated by revolving the circle $(x-R)^2 + z^2 = r^2$ in the $xz$-plane around the $z$-axis. The parallels (v-curves) are the circles generated by the rotation. Their tangent vectors, $X_v$, are therefore always horizontal and point in the direction of rotation (azimuthal direction). The meridians (u-curves) are the instances of the generating circle at different rotational angles. Their tangent vectors, $X_u$, lie in the vertical planes containing the $z$-axis and the point of tangency.\n\nAt any point $P$ on the torus, the tangent vector $X_v$ lies in the horizontal plane through $P$ and is perpendicular to the radial vector from the $z$-axis to $P$. The tangent vector $X_u$ lies in the vertical plane containing the $z$-axis and $P$. Any vector in this vertical plane is orthogonal to the azimuthal-direction vector $X_v$. Therefore, $X_u$ and $X_v$ are orthogonal at every point. This geometric orthogonality is the reason that their dot product, $F$, is identically zero.
