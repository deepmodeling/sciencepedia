The components are:\n1. The Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla^M$ of the ambient manifold $(M, g)$, which is used to define the second fundamental form.\n2. The second fundamental form $B_g(X,Y) = (\\nabla^M_X Y)^{\\perp_g}$.\n3. The induced metric on the submanifold, $g_{\\Sigma}$, and its inverse, which is used to compute the trace.\n\nLet us denote the quantities computed with respect to the scaled metric $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$ with a subscript $\\lambda$, e.g., $\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}$, $B_{g_{\\lambda}}$, $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}$, and $H_{g_{\\lambda}}$.\n\nStep 1: Transformation of the Levi-Civita Connection\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla^M$ is uniquely determined by the metric $g$ through the Koszul formula. For vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $M$, the connection $\\nabla^M$ satisfies:\n$$ 2g(\\nabla^M_X Y, Z) = X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) - g(X, [Y,Z]) + g(Y, [Z,X]) + g(Z, [X,Y]) $$\nLet $\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}$ be the Levi-Civita connection corresponding to the metric $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$. It must satisfy the same formula with $g$ replaced by $g_{\\lambda}$:\n$$ 2g_{\\lambda}(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z) = X(g_{\\lambda}(Y,Z)) + Y(g_{\\lambda}(X,Z)) - Z(g_{\\lambda}(X,Y)) - g_{\\lambda}(X, [Y,Z]) + g_{\\lambda}(Y, [Z,X]) + g_{\\lambda}(Z, [X,Y]) $$\nSubstituting $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$ into the left-hand side gives $2\\lambda^2 g(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z)$.\nSubstituting into the right-hand side, and using the fact that $\\lambda$ is a constant so its derivative is zero (e.g., $X(\\lambda^2 g(Y,Z)) = \\lambda^2 X(g(Y,Z))$), we get:\n$$ \\lambda^2 \\left( X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) - g(X, [Y,Z]) + g(Y, [Z,X]) + g(Z, [X,Y]) \\right) $$\nThis expression is exactly $\\lambda^2$ times the right-hand side of the original Koszul formula for $\\nabla^M$. Thus, we have the equality:\n$$ 2\\lambda^2 g(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z) = \\lambda^2 \\left( 2g(\\nabla^M_X Y, Z) \\right) $$\nSince $\\lambda > 0$, we can divide by $2\\lambda^2$ to obtain:\n$$ g(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z) = g(\\nabla^M_X Y, Z) $$\nThis holds for all vector fields $Z$. Since the metric $g$ is non-degenerate, this implies that the two vectors are identical:\n$$ \\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y = \\nabla^M_X Y $$\nThe Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant homothetic scaling of the metric.\n\nStep 2: Transformation of the Second Fundamental Form\nThe second fundamental form with respect to $g_{\\lambda}$ is defined as $B_{g_{\\lambda}}(X, Y) = (\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}}$ for vector fields $X, Y$ tangent to $\\Sigma$.\nFrom Step 1, we know that $\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y = \\nabla^M_X Y$. Therefore, $B_{g_{\\lambda}}(X, Y) = (\\nabla^M_X Y)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}}$.\nThe operation $(\\cdot)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}}$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the normal bundle $N\\Sigma$ with respect to the metric $g_{\\lambda}$. At any point $p \\in \\Sigma$, the tangent space of the ambient manifold decomposes as $T_p M = T_p \\Sigma \\oplus (N\\Sigma)_p$. This decomposition is orthogonal, meaning that for any $v \\in T_p \\Sigma$ and $w \\in (N\\Sigma)_p$, we have $g(v, w) = 0$.\nThe orthogonality condition with respect to the new metric $g_{\\lambda}$ is $g_{\\lambda}(v, w) = \\lambda^2 g(v, w)$. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, it is clear that $g_{\\lambda}(v, w) = 0$ if and only if $g(v, w) = 0$. This means that the notion of orthogonality between the tangent and normal spaces is unchanged. The subspaces $T_p\\Sigma$ and $(N\\Sigma)_p$ remain orthogonal under the scaled metric.\nThe projection of a vector $V \\in T_p M$ onto the normal space $(N\\Sigma)_p$ depends only on the direct sum decomposition $T_p M = T_p \\Sigma \\oplus (N\\Sigma)_p$, not on the specific values of the inner product. Since this decomposition is the same for both metrics, the projection operator itself is unchanged. That is, $(\\cdot)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}} = (\\cdot)^{\\perp_{g}}$.\nCombining these results, we find that the second fundamental form is invariant under the scaling:\n$$ B_{g_{\\lambda}}(X, Y) = (\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}} = (\\nabla^M_X Y)^{\\perp_{g}} = B_g(X, Y) $$\n\nStep 3: Transformation of the Induced Metric and its Inverse\nThe induced metric on $\\Sigma$ with respect to $g$ is $g_{\\Sigma}$, defined by $g_{\\Sigma}(X, Y) = g(X, Y)$ for $X, Y \\in \\Gamma(T\\Sigma)$.\nThe induced metric with respect to $g_{\\lambda}$ is $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}$, defined by $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}(X, Y) = g_{\\lambda}(X, Y)$ for $X, Y \\in \\Gamma(T\\Sigma)$.\nUsing the scaling relation $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$, we have:\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}(X, Y) = \\lambda^2 g(X, Y) = \\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma}(X, Y) $$\nSo, the induced metric scales by a factor of $\\lambda^2$: $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma} = \\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma}$.\nNow, let's consider the components of the inverse metric, which are used to compute the trace. In a local coordinate system $\\{x^i\\}$ on $\\Sigma$, with basis vectors $e_i = \\partial/\\partial x^i$, the components of the induced metric are $g_{\\Sigma, ij} = g_{\\Sigma}(e_i, e_j)$. The components of its inverse, $g_{\\Sigma}^{ij}$, satisfy $g_{\\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\Sigma, kj} = \\delta^i_j$.\nThe components of the scaled induced metric are $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma, ij} = \\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma, ij}$. Let the inverse components be $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij}$. By definition of the inverse, we must have:\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma, kj} = \\delta^i_j $$\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} (\\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma, kj}) = \\delta^i_j $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 (g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\Sigma, kj}) = \\delta^i_j $$\nComparing this with $g_{\\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\Sigma, kj} = \\delta^i_j$, we see that $\\lambda^2 g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} = g_{\\Sigma}^{ik}$, which implies:\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij} = \\lambda^{-2} g_{\\Sigma}^{ij} $$\nThe components of the inverse induced metric scale by a factor of $\\lambda^{-2}$.\n\nStep 4: Assembling the Final Result\nThe mean curvature vector is defined as the trace of the second fundamental form. In local coordinates, this is:\n$$ H_g = g_{\\Sigma}^{ij} B_g(e_i, e_j) $$\nThe mean curvature vector with respect to the scaled metric $g_{\\lambda}$ is:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij} B_{g_{\\lambda}}(e_i, e_j) $$\nNow, we substitute the transformation laws derived in the previous steps:\n1. $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij} = \\lambda^{-2} g_{\\Sigma}^{ij}$ (from Step 3)\n2. $B_{g_{\\lambda}}(e_i, e_j) = B_g(e_i, e_j)$ (from Step 2)\nSubstituting these into the expression for $H_{g_{\\lambda}}$ gives:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = (\\lambda^{-2} g_{\\Sigma}^{ij}) B_g(e_i, e_j) $$\nFactoring out the constant $\\lambda^{-2}$:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = \\lambda^{-2} \\left( g_{\\Sigma}^{ij} B_g(e_i, e_j) \\right) $$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is precisely the definition of the original mean curvature vector, $H_g$.\nTherefore, we arrive at the final scaling law:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = \\lambda^{-2} H_g $$\nThe mean curvature vector scales inversely with the square of the homothetic scaling factor $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda^{-2} H_{g}}$$", "id": "3000892"}, {"introduction": "Building on foundational principles, we now turn to a concrete and important geometric construction: the conical hypersurface.

We will derive this by directly computing the shape operator of the cone.\n\nFirst, we establish our sign convention for the curvature quantities. Let $M$ be an oriented hypersurface embedded in an ambient Riemannian manifold $\\bar{M}$, with a chosen unit normal vector field $\\nu$. The shape operator (or Weingarten map) $S_p: T_p M \\to T_p M$ at a point $p \\in M$ is defined by $S_p(v) = -(\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu)^{\\top}$, where $\\bar{\\nabla}$ is the covariant derivative in $\\bar{M}$ and $(\\cdot)^{\\top}$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the tangent space $T_p M$. The mean curvature scalar, which we will denote by the symbol $h$ to avoid confusion with the vector, is the trace of the shape operator: $h_M(p) = \\text{tr}(S_p)$. The mean curvature vector is then defined as $H_M(p) = h_M(p) \\nu(p)$. In the context of this problem, the ambient manifold is Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, so the covariant derivative $\\bar{\\nabla}$ is the standard directional derivative, which we denote by $D$.\n\nLet $x$ be a point on the cone $C \\setminus \\{0\\}$. By definition, $x$ can be written as $x = r p$ for a unique $r > 0$ and $p \\in \\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{S}^m$. The problem states that the cone is oriented by the unit normal field $\\nu_C(x) = \\nu_C(r p) := \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$, where $\\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$ is the unit normal to $\\Sigma$ within the tangent space $T_p \\mathbb{S}^m$. This means $\\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$ is orthogonal to $T_p \\Sigma$ and also tangent to $\\mathbb{S}^m$ at $p$, which implies $\\langle \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p), p \\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_x C$ at $x=rp$ is an $m$-dimensional vector space. It is spanned by vectors arising from differentiating the position vector $x=rp$ with respect to $r$ and with respect to parameters on $\\Sigma$. The radial direction gives the tangent vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(rp) = p$. Tangent vectors to $\\Sigma$ at $p$, which form an $(m-1)$-dimensional space $T_p\\Sigma$, also lie in $T_x C$. Since any vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$ is tangent to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^m$ at $p$, it is orthogonal to the position vector $p$. Thus, $T_x C$ is the orthogonal direct sum of the radial direction and the tangential directions from $\\Sigma$: $T_x C = \\text{span}\\{p\\} \\oplus T_p\\Sigma$. Consequently, an orthonormal basis for $T_x C$ can be formed by $\\{p, e_1, \\ldots, e_{m-1}\\}$, where $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_{m-1}\\}$ is any orthonormal basis for $T_p\\Sigma$.\n\nTo compute the mean curvature scalar $h_C(x) = \\text{tr}(S_C)$, we will find the trace of the shape operator $S_C$ with respect to this basis.\n$h_C(x) = \\langle S_C(p), p \\rangle + \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \\langle S_C(e_i), e_i \\rangle$.\n\nLet's compute the action of $S_C(v) = -(D_v \\nu_C)^{\\top}$ on the basis vectors.\n\n1.  Action on the radial vector $p$:\n    We compute $D_p \\nu_C$. This is the directional derivative of the field $\\nu_C$ in the direction $p$. The normal field is given by $\\nu_C(rp') = \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p')$. To find the derivative at $x=rp$ in the direction $p$, we consider the curve $\\gamma(t) = (r+t)p$. The normal along this curve is $\\nu_C(\\gamma(t)) = \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$, which is constant. Therefore,\n    $$\n    D_p \\nu_C = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_C((r+t)p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) = 0.\n    $$\n    This implies $S_C(p) = - (0)^{\\top} = 0$. The principal curvature in the radial direction is $0$. Thus, the first term in the trace expansion, $\\langle S_C(p), p \\rangle$, is $0$.\n\n2.  Action on a tangential vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$:\n    Let $v$ be any vector in $T_p\\Sigma$. To compute $D_v\\nu_C$, we consider a curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $C$ passing through $x=rp$ at $t=0$ with velocity $v$. Let $\\alpha(s)$ be a curve in $\\Sigma$ with $\\alpha(0)=p$ and $\\alpha'(0)=v$. We can define a curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $C$ as $\\gamma(t) = r \\cdot \\alpha(t/r)$. Its velocity at $t=0$ is $\\gamma'(0) = r \\cdot \\alpha'(0) \\cdot (1/r) = v$, as desired. The normal vector field along this curve is $\\nu_C(\\gamma(t)) = \\nu_{\\Sigma}(\\alpha(t/r))$. The directional derivative is:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_C = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_C(\\gamma(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(\\alpha(t/r)).\n    $$\n    Using the chain rule, this becomes:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_C = \\left( \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(\\alpha(s)) \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{r} D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}.\n    $$\n    Here $D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is the covariant derivative of the vector field $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ (defined on $\\Sigma$) in the direction $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$, calculated in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$. We relate this to the geometry of $\\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{S}^m$. Let $\\bar{\\nabla}$ be the Levi-Civita connection on $\\mathbb{S}^m$. The Gauss formula for $\\mathbb{S}^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ states $D_X Y = \\bar{\\nabla}_X Y - \\langle X, Y \\rangle P$, where $P$ is the position vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^m$ (i.e. the outward normal). Applying this to the vector field $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ (which is tangent to $\\mathbb{S}^m$ along $\\Sigma$) and a vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$, we get:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = \\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} - \\langle v, \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) \\rangle p.\n    $$\n    Since $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is the normal to $\\Sigma$ within $T_p\\mathbb{S}^m$, it is orthogonal to any vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$. Thus, $\\langle v, \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) \\rangle = 0$. This simplifies the expression to $D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = \\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}$.\n    By definition of the shape operator $S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}$ of $\\Sigma$ in $\\mathbb{S}^m$ (with respect to normal $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$), we have $S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v) = -(\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma})^{\\top_{\\Sigma}}$, where $\\top_{\\Sigma}$ is projection onto $T_p\\Sigma$. As $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is a unit vector field on $\\Sigma$, $\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is automatically orthogonal to $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$, meaning it lies in $T_p \\Sigma$. So, $\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = -S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v)$.\n    Combining these results, we find:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_C = \\frac{1}{r} D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{r} \\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = -\\frac{1}{r} S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v).\n    $$\n    The shape operator of the cone acts on $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$ as $S_C(v) = -(D_v \\nu_C)^{\\top}$. The vector $S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v)$ is in $T_p\\Sigma$, which is a subspace of $T_x C$. Therefore, the projection $(\\cdot)^{\\top}$ is the identity on this vector:\n    $$\n    S_C(v) = - \\left( -\\frac{1}{r} S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v) \\right) = \\frac{1}{r} S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v).\n    $$\n\nNow we compute the mean curvature scalar $h_C(x)$.

So, $h_C(rp) = \\frac{H_{\\Sigma}(p)}{r}$.\n\nFinally, the mean curvature vector $H_C$ at $x=rp$ is given by $H_C(x) = h_C(x) \\nu_C(x)$. Substituting the expressions for the scalar curvature and the normal vector:\n$$\nH_C(r p) = \\frac{H_{\\Sigma}(p)}{r} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p).\n$$\n\nThe singular behavior of $H_C$ as $r \\to 0$ is evident from this formula. As the point $x=rp$ approaches the apex of the cone at the origin ($r \\to 0$), the magnitude of the mean curvature vector, $\\|H_C(rp)\\| = \\frac{|H_{\\Sigma}(p)|}{r}$, blows up at a rate of $r^{-1}$, provided that $H_{\\Sigma}(p) \\neq 0$. The apex of the cone is a curvature singularity.\n\nA special and important case arises when $\\Sigma$ is a minimal hypersurface in $\\mathbb{S}^m$. By definition, this means its mean curvature scalar is zero everywhere, i.e., $H_{\\Sigma}(p) = 0$ for all $p \\in \\Sigma$. In this situation, the formula for the mean curvature vector of the cone yields:\n$$\nH_C(rp) = \\frac{0}{r} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } r>0.\n$$\nThis demonstrates the significant result that the cone over a minimal hypersurface of the sphere is itself a minimal hypersurface in Euclidean space (away from the singular apex).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{H_{\\Sigma}(p)}{r} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)}\n$$", "id": "3000913"}, {"introduction": "A vanishing mean curvature vector, $H=0$, characterizes minimal surfaces, which are critical points of the area functional.

Verification of Conformality and Minimal Surface Property**\n\nFirst, we compute the tangent vectors by differentiating the parametrization $X(u,v)$ with respect to the coordinates $u$ and $v$:\n$$ X_u = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial u} = \\left( \\sinh(u) \\cos(v), \\sinh(u) \\sin(v), 1 \\right) $$\n$$ X_v = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial v} = \\left( -\\cosh(u) \\sin(v), \\cosh(u) \\cos(v), 0 \\right) $$\nThe components of the induced metric tensor $g$ are given by the dot products of these tangent vectors, $g_{ij} = X_i \\cdot X_j$:\n$$ g_{uu} = X_u \\cdot X_u = \\sinh^2(u) \\cos^2(v) + \\sinh^2(u) \\sin^2(v) + 1^2 = \\sinh^2(u) + 1 = \\cosh^2(u) $$\n$$ g_{uv} = X_u \\cdot X_v = -\\sinh(u)\\cosh(u)\\cos(v)\\sin(v) + \\sinh(u)\\cosh(u)\\sin(v)\\cos(v) + 0 = 0 $$\n$$ g_{vv} = X_v \\cdot X_v = \\cosh^2(u) \\sin^2(v) + \\cosh^2(u) \\cos^2(v) + 0^2 = \\cosh^2(u) $$\nThe induced metric is therefore $g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh^2(u) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cosh^2(u) \\end{pmatrix}$. The line element is $ds^2 = \\cosh^2(u) du^2 + \\cosh^2(u) dv^2 = \\cosh^2(u) (du^2 + dv^2)$. This is of the form $\\lambda(u,v)(du^2 + dv^2)$, which shows that the coordinates $(u,v)$ are conformal.\n\nTo verify that the catenoid is a minimal surface, we must show its mean curvature vector $\\mathbf{H}$ is zero. This is equivalent to showing the scalar mean curvature $H$ is zero. We first compute the unit normal vector $\\nu$.\n$$ X_u \\times X_v = \\left( -\\cosh(u)\\cos(v), -\\cosh(u)\\sin(v), \\sinh(u)\\cosh(u) \\right) $$\nThe magnitude is $\\|X_u \\times X_v\\| = \\sqrt{\\cosh^2(u) + \\sinh^2(u)\\cosh^2(u)} = \\sqrt{\\cosh^2(u)(1+\\sinh^2(u))} = \\cosh^2(u)$.\nLet's choose the outward-pointing normal vector:\n$$ \\nu = - \\frac{X_u \\times X_v}{\\|X_u \\times X_v\\|} = \\left( \\frac{\\cos(v)}{\\cosh(u)}, \\frac{\\sin(v)}{\\cosh(u)}, -\\tanh(u) \\right) $$\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives of $X$:\n$$ X_{uu} = \\left( \\cosh(u)\\cos(v), \\cosh(u)\\sin(v), 0 \\right) $$\n$$ X_{uv} = \\left( -\\sinh(u)\\sin(v), \\sinh(u)\\cos(v), 0 \\right) $$\n$$ X_{vv} = \\left( -\\cosh(u)\\cos(v), -\\cosh(u)\\sin(v), 0 \\right) $$\nThe components of the second fundamental form, $L_{ij} = X_{ij} \\cdot \\nu$, are:\n$$ L_{uu} = X_{uu} \\cdot \\nu = \\frac{\\cosh(u)\\cos^2(v)}{\\cosh(u)} + \\frac{\\cosh(u)\\sin^2(v)}{\\cosh(u)} = 1 $$\n$$ L_{uv} = X_{uv} \\cdot \\nu = -\\frac{\\sinh(u)\\sin(v)\\cos(v)}{\\cosh(u)} + \\frac{\\sinh(u)\\cos(v)\\sin(v)}{\\cosh(u)} = 0 $$\n$$ L_{vv} = X_{vv} \\cdot \\nu = -\\frac{\\cosh(u)\\cos^2(v)}{\\cosh(u)} - \\frac{\\cosh(u)\\sin^2(v)}{\\cosh(u)} = -1 $$\nThe mean curvature $H$ is given by $H = \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}_g(\\mathbf{A}) = \\frac{1}{2}(g^{uu}L_{uu} + g^{vv}L_{vv})$. Since $g_{uu} = g_{vv} = \\cosh^2(u)$, the inverse metric components are $g^{uu} = g^{vv} = 1/\\cosh^2(u)$.\n$$ H = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} \\cdot (1) + \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} \\cdot (-1) \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $H=0$, the mean curvature vector $\\mathbf{H} = H\\nu$ is the zero vector, and the catenoid is a minimal surface.\n\n**2. Induced Metric and Gaussian Curvature**\n\nAs computed above, the induced metric is $g = \\cosh^2(u)(du^2 + dv^2)$.\nThe problem provides the formula for Gaussian curvature $K$ for a conformal metric $g = \\exp(2\\varphi) (du^2 + dv^2)$ as $K = -\\exp(-2\\varphi) \\Delta \\varphi$, where $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial u^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v^2}$.\nFrom our metric, we identify $\\exp(2\\varphi) = \\cosh^2(u)$, so $\\exp(\\varphi) = \\cosh(u)$, which gives $\\varphi(u,v) = \\ln(\\cosh(u))$.\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $\\varphi$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\sinh(u)}{\\cosh(u)} = \\tanh(u) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi}{\\partial u^2} = \\frac{d}{du}\\tanh(u) = \\operatorname{sech}^2(u) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} $$\nSince $\\varphi$ does not depend on $v$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi}{\\partial v^2} = 0$. The Laplacian is $\\Delta \\varphi = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)}$.\nNow we can compute the Gaussian curvature:\n$$ K = -\\exp(-2\\varphi) \\Delta \\varphi = -\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} = -\\frac{1}{\\cosh^4(u)} $$\n\n**3. Second Variation of Area**\n\nFor a minimal surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the second variation of the area functional for a compactly supported normal variation $f\\nu$ is given by the quadratic form:\n$$ Q(f,f) = \\int_M \\left( |\\nabla_g f|^2 - \\|\\mathbf{A}\\|^2 f^2 \\right) dA_g $$\nwhere $M$ is the surface, $|\\nabla_g f|^2$ is the squared norm of the gradient of $f$ with respect to the metric $g$, $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|^2$ is the squared norm of the second fundamental form, and $dA_g$ is the area element.\nLet us express each term in the conformal coordinates $(u,v)$.\nThe metric is $g_{ij} = \\cosh^2(u) \\delta_{ij}$. The area element is $dA_g = \\sqrt{\\det g} \\,du\\,dv = \\cosh^2(u) \\,du\\,dv$.\nThe squared norm of the gradient is $|\\nabla_g f|^2 = g^{ij}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j} = g^{uu}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}\\right)^2 + g^{vv}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\right)^2$. With $g^{uu} = g^{vv} = 1/\\cosh^2(u)$, we have:\n$$ |\\nabla_g f|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\right)^2 \\right) $$\nThe squared norm of the second fundamental form is $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|^2 = k_1^2 + k_2^2$, where $k_1, k_2$ are the principal curvatures. These are the eigenvalues of the shape operator $S = g^{-1}L$.\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe principal curvatures are $k_1 = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)}$ and $k_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)}$.\nTherefore, $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{\\cosh^4(u)}$.\nSubstituting these terms into the expression for $Q(f,f)$:\n$$ Q(f,f) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{S}^1} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(u)} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\right)^2 \\right) - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^4(u)} f^2 \\right] \\cosh^2(u) \\,du\\,dv $$\nSimplifying, we get the expression in conformal coordinates:\n$$ Q(f,f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\right)^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(u)} f^2 \\right] du\\,dv $$\n\n**4. Fourier Decomposition and 1D Spectral Problem**\n\nWe decompose the variation $f(u,v)$ into its Fourier modes with respect to the angle $v$:\n$$ f(u,v) = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\phi_m(u) e^{imv} $$\nSubstituting this into the quadratic form and using the orthogonality of complex exponentials, $\\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{i(m-n)v} dv = 2\\pi \\delta_{mn}$, we separate the integral:\n$$ Q(f,f) = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} 2\\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ |\\phi_m'(u)|^2 + m^2 |\\phi_m(u)|^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(u)} |\\phi_m(u)|^2 \\right] du $$\nThis can be written as $Q(f,f) = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} Q_m(\\phi_m, \\phi_m)$, where\n$$ Q_m(\\phi_m, \\phi_m) = 2\\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ |\\phi_m'(u)|^2 + \\left(m^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(u)}\\right) |\\phi_m(u)|^2 \\right] du $$\nIntegrating by parts, we identify the associated one-dimensional Schrödinger operator for each mode $m$:\n$$ L_m = -\\frac{d^2}{du^2} + V_m(u) \\quad \\text{with potential} \\quad V_m(u) = m^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(u)} $$\nThe Morse index is the total number of negative eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator $L = -\\Delta_g - \\|\\mathbf{A}\\|^2$, which is the sum of the number of negative eigenvalues of each $L_m$ over all integer modes $m$.\nThe operator $L_0 = -\\frac{d^2}{du^2} - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(u)}$ has a Pöschl-Teller potential. For a potential of the form $-s(s+1)\\operatorname{sech}^2(u)$, we have $s(s+1)=2$, which gives $s=1$. The theory of this operator establishes that it has a single bound state (an $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ eigenfunction) with eigenvalue $E_0 = -(s-0)^2 = -1$.\nThe operator for any mode $m$ is $L_m = L_0 + m^2$. Its spectrum is the spectrum of $L_0$ shifted by $m^2$. The spectrum of $L_0$ consists of the single eigenvalue $-1$ and the continuous spectrum $[0, \\infty)$. Therefore, the spectrum of $L_m$ consists of a single eigenvalue $\\lambda_m = m^2 - 1$ and the continuous spectrum $[m^2, \\infty)$.\n\n**5. Computation of the Morse Index**\n\nThe Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator, counted with multiplicity. We need to find for which integer values of $m$ the eigenvalue $\\lambda_m$ is negative.\n$$ \\lambda_m < 0 \\implies m^2 - 1 < 0 \\implies m^2 < 1 $$\nSince $m$ must be an integer, the only value that satisfies this inequality is $m=0$.\n- For $m=0$, we have one negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0^2-1 = -1$.\n- For $m=\\pm 1$, we have a zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\pm 1} = (\\pm 1)^2 - 1 = 0$. These correspond to Jacobi fields (infinitesimal isometries) and are not strictly negative, so they do not contribute to the Morse index.\n- For all other integer modes, $|m| \\ge 2$, we have $\\lambda_m = m^2-1 > 0$. There are no negative eigenvalues.\n\nSumming the number of negative eigenvalues over all modes, we find that only the $m=0$ mode contributes. It contributes exactly one negative eigenvalue. Thus, the Morse index of the catenoid is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3000900"}]}
