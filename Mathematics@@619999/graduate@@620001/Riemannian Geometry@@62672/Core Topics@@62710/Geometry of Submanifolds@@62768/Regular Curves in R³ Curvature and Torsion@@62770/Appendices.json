It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the curvature and Frenet-Serret apparatus of a straight line, defined by the parametric equation $\\gamma(t) = p + v t$, where $p, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ are constant vectors and $v$ is nonzero. The analysis must be based on the fundamental definitions in terms of the arc-length parameter $s$.\n\n(a) Reparametrization by arc length and computation of curvature $\\kappa(s)$.\n\nFirst, we find the arc-length function $s(t)$. The tangent vector with respect to the parameter $t$ is the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\n\\gamma^{\\prime}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(p + v t) = v\n$$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this vector:\n$$\n\\|\\gamma^{\\prime}(t)\\| = \\|v\\|\n$$\nSince $v$ is a constant nonzero vector, the speed $\\|v\\|$ is a positive constant. Let us denote this constant by $c = \\|v\\| > 0$.\n\nThe arc-length function $s(t)$, measured from $t=0$, is given by the integral of the speed:\n$$\ns(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\|\\gamma^{\\prime}(\\xi)\\| \\,d\\xi = \\int_{0}^{t} c \\,d\\xi = c t\n$$\nThus, we have the relationship $s = c t$. To reparametrize the curve by arc length, we express $t$ as a function of $s$:\n$$\nt(s) = \\frac{s}{c} = \\frac{s}{\\|v\\|}\n$$\nWe substitute this into the original equation for $\\gamma$ to obtain the arc-length parametrization, which we also denote by $\\gamma(s)$:\n$$\n\\gamma(s) = p + v \\, t(s) = p + v \\frac{s}{\\|v\\|} = p + \\left(\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right) s\n$$\nThis is the equation of the line parametrized by its arc length.\n\nNext, we compute the unit tangent vector $T(s)$, which is defined as the derivative of the arc-length-parametrized curve with respect to $s$:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{ds}(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( p + \\left(\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right) s \\right)\n$$\nSince $p$ and $v$ are constant vectors, the term $\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}$ is also a constant vector. The derivative is therefore:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\n$$\nWe observe that the unit tangent vector $T(s)$ is a constant vector; it does not change as $s$ varies. This is geometrically intuitive, as a straight line always points in the same direction.\n\nThe curvature, $\\kappa(s)$, is defined as the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\left\\| \\frac{dT}{ds}(s) \\right\\|\n$$\nSince $T(s)$ is a constant vector, its derivative with respect to $s$ is the zero vector:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{ds}(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|} \\right) = \\vec{0}\n$$\nTherefore, the curvature is the magnitude of the zero vector, which is zero for all $s$:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\|\\vec{0}\\| = 0\n$$\nThe curvature of a straight line is identically zero, which confirms the intuition that curvature measures the failure of a curve to be a straight line.\n\n(b) The Frenet-Serret apparatus.\n\nThe Frenet-Serret frame $\\{T(s), N(s), B(s)\\}$ and the torsion $\\tau(s)$ are constructed from the derivatives of the curve. The construction begins after computing $T(s)$ and $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$.\n\nThe first Frenet-Serret equation is $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s) = \\kappa(s) N(s)$. The principal normal vector, $N(s)$, is defined as the unit vector in the direction of $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$. Specifically, for curves where $\\kappa(s) \\neq 0$, it is given by:\n$$\nN(s) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa(s)} \\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\n$$\nAs we found in part (a), for a straight line, $\\kappa(s) = 0$ for all $s$. Consequently, the denominator in the expression for $N(s)$ is zero. Moreover, the numerator $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$ is also the zero vector. The expression becomes $\\frac{\\vec{0}}{0}$, which is indeterminate. The principal normal vector $N(s)$ is therefore not well-defined.\n\nGeometrically, $N(s)$ points in the direction the curve is turning. A straight line does not turn, so there is no unique direction of turning. At any point on the line, any unit vector orthogonal to the tangent vector $T$ could be chosen as a normal, but there is no canonical choice determined by the geometry of the curve itself.\n\nThe binormal vector $B(s)$ is defined by the cross product $B(s) = T(s) \\times N(s)$. Since $N(s)$ is not well-defined, $B(s)$ is also not well-defined.\n\nFinally, the torsion $\\tau(s)$ is defined via the Frenet-Serret equation $\\frac{dB}{ds}(s) = -\\tau(s) N(s)$. Since both $B(s)$ and $N(s)$ are undefined, the torsion $\\tau(s)$ is also not defined within this formal framework. The entire Frenet-Serret apparatus collapses for a curve with zero curvature.\n\nThe implication is that the concept of torsion, which measures the rate at which a curve twists out of its osculating plane (the plane spanned by $T$ and $N$), is not applicable to a straight line because a unique osculating plane does not exist. Although by convention the torsion of a straight line is taken to be $0$, this is an assignment made for consistency, not a value derived from a well-defined Frenet-Serret apparatus.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2988149"}, {"introduction": "Having established that curvature quantifies a curve's failure to be straight, we now investigate a curve that bends but remains confined to a single plane [@problem_id:2988157]. This practice introduces torsion, $\\tau$, and reveals its geometric meaning as a measure of non-planarity. By analyzing a planar lemniscate, you will demonstrate that a curve can have a rich, non-constant curvature while its torsion remains identically zero, reinforcing the role of $\\tau$ as the invariant that governs a curve's \"twist\" out of its osculating plane.", "problem": "Let $a>0$ and consider the planar lemniscate of Gerono embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by\n$$\n\\gamma(t) \\;=\\; \\big(a \\sin t,\\; a \\sin t \\cos t,\\; 0\\big), \\quad t \\in \\mathbb{R},\n$$\nwith the angle $t$ measured in radians.

This means the curve is **planar** and lies entirely within the $xy$-plane ($z=0$). This geometric fact is the key to the solution.\n\nAccording to the problem's constraints, we must follow the Frenet-Serret framework.\n1.  **Tangent Vector (T):** The velocity vector is $\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}$. Its third component will be zero. Therefore, the unit tangent vector $T(t) = \\frac{\\gamma'(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$ must also have a zero third component. We can write $T(t) = (T_x(t), T_y(t), 0)$. It lies in the $xy$-plane.\n\n2.  **Normal Vector (N):** The principal normal vector $N(t)$ is proportional to $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$, or using the chain rule, proportional to $\\frac{dT}{dt}(t)$. Since $T(t)$ lies in the $xy$-plane, its derivative $\\frac{dT}{dt}(t)$ must also lie in the $xy$-plane. Consequently, the unit normal vector $N(t)$, which is the normalization of this derivative vector, must also have a zero third component. We can write $N(t) = (N_x(t), N_y(t), 0)$.\n\n3.  **Binormal Vector (B):** The binormal vector is defined by the cross product $B(t) = T(t) \\times N(t)$. Let's compute this product for vectors lying in the $xy$-plane:\n    $$\n    B(t) = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ T_x(t) & T_y(t) & 0 \\\\ N_x(t) & N_y(t) & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = (0)\\mathbf{i} - (0)\\mathbf{j} + (T_x N_y - T_y N_x)\\mathbf{k}\n    $$\n    This shows that the binormal vector $B(t)$ is always parallel to the $z$-axis. Since $B(t)$ must be a unit vector, it can only be one of two possibilities: $\\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1)$ or $-\\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, -1)$. Because the curve is continuous, on any interval where the Frenet frame is defined, $B(t)$ must be a constant vector.\n\n4.  **Torsion (τ):** Torsion is defined through the Frenet-Serret formula involving the derivative of the binormal vector: $\\frac{dB}{ds} = -\\tau N$.\n    Since we established that $B(t)$ is a constant vector (either $(0,0,1)$ or $(0,0,-1)$), its derivative with respect to arc length $s$ (or any parameter) must be the zero vector:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dB}{ds}(s) = \\vec{0}\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the Frenet-Serret equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\vec{0} = -\\tau(s) N(s)\n    $$\n    On the open set where the curvature is nonzero, the principal normal vector $N(s)$ is, by definition, a unit vector and is therefore not the zero vector. For the equation to hold, the scalar factor $\\tau(s)$ (or $\\tau(t)$) must be zero.\n    $$\n    \\tau(t) = 0\n    $$\n\n**Explanation:** Torsion ($\\tau$) fundamentally measures the rate at which a curve twists out of its osculating plane. For a planar curve, the osculating plane is the plane containing the curve itself. Since the curve never leaves this plane, the osculating plane does not twist, and therefore the torsion is identically zero. The curvature ($\\kappa$) measures how the curve bends *within* its plane. For the given lemniscate, the curvature is non-constant (it is not a circle or a line), demonstrating that zero torsion and non-constant curvature are perfectly compatible.

The derivatives with respect to the parameter $t$ are denoted by primes, e.g., $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$.
