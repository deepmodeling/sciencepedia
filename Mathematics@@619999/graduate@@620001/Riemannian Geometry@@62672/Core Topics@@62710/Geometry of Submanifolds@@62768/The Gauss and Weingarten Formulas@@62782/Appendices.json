The coefficient of the second fundamental form is defined as $L_{11} = f_{uu} \\cdot n$. We computed this value at $(1,-1)$ as:\n$$\nL_{11}(1,-1) = f_{uu}(1,-1) \\cdot n(1,-1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\nThe normal component of $D_{\\partial_{u}}\\partial_{u}f = f_{uu}$ is the vector $(f_{uu})^N$. We must verify that this equals $L_{11} n$.\nWe calculated $(f_{uu})^N = (0, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})$.\nNow we compute $L_{11}(1,-1) n(1,-1)$:\n$$\nL_{11}(1,-1) n(1,-1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{(0,2,1)}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}(0,2,1) = \\left(0, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}\\right)\n$$\nThe two results are identical. This confirms that $(f_{uu})^N = L_{11} n$ at the point $(1,-1)$, thus verifying the consistency of the Gauss formula by direct calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the single quantity $\\Gamma^{2}_{11}(1,-1)$.

Since both $S_{\\nu_1}$ and $S_{\\nu_2}$ are self-adjoint, we can manipulate the inner products:\n$$\n\\langle S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{1}), S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{2}) \\rangle = \\langle S_{\\nu_{1}}(S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{1})), e_{2} \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\langle S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{2}), S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1}) \\rangle = \\langle e_{2}, S_{\\nu_{2}}(S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1})) \\rangle = \\langle S_{\\nu_{2}}(S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1})), e_{2} \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting these back, we obtain the relation to the commutator $[S_{\\nu_{1}}, S_{\\nu_{2}}] = S_{\\nu_{1}}S_{\\nu_{2}} - S_{\\nu_{2}}S_{\\nu_{1}}$:\n$$\n\\langle R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2}) \\nu_{1}, \\nu_{2} \\rangle = \\langle S_{\\nu_{1}}(S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{1})), e_{2} \\rangle - \\langle S_{\\nu_{2}}(S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1})), e_{2} \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n= \\langle (S_{\\nu_{1}}S_{\\nu_{2}} - S_{\\nu_{2}}S_{\\nu_{1}})(e_{1}), e_{2} \\rangle = \\langle [S_{\\nu_{1}}, S_{\\nu_{2}}](e_{1}), e_{2} \\rangle\n$$\nThis general result connects the normal curvature to the commutator of the shape operators. Now we compute this quantity explicitly using the given matrix representations at $p$.\n\nThe basis for $T_p\\Sigma$ is $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$, which is orthonormal. The matrices for the shape operators are given as:\n$$\n[S_{\\nu_{1}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & c \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad [S_{\\nu_{2}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ q & r \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis means:\n$S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1}) = a e_{1} + b e_{2}$\n$S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{2}) = b e_{1} + c e_{2}$\nand\n$S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{1}) = p e_{1} + q e_{2}$\n$S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{2}) = q e_{1} + r e_{2}$\n\nWe need to compute $[S_{\\nu_{1}}, S_{\\nu_{2}}](e_{1}) = S_{\\nu_{1}}(S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{1})) - S_{\\nu_{2}}(S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1}))$.\nFirst, we compute the action of the composed operators on $e_{1}$:\n$$\nS_{\\nu_{1}}(S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{1})) = S_{\\nu_{1}}(p e_{1} + q e_{2}) = p S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1}) + q S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{2})\n$$\n$$\n= p(a e_{1} + b e_{2}) + q(b e_{1} + c e_{2}) = (ap+bq)e_{1} + (bp+cq)e_{2}\n$$\nNext,\n$$\nS_{\\nu_{2}}(S_{\\nu_{1}}(e_{1})) = S_{\\nu_{2}}(a e_{1} + b e_{2}) = a S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{1}) + b S_{\\nu_{2}}(e_{2})\n$$\n$$\n= a(p e_{1} + q e_{2}) + b(q e_{1} + r e_{2}) = (ap+bq)e_{1} + (aq+br)e_{2}\n$$\nNow, we find their difference:\n$$\n[S_{\\nu_{1}}, S_{\\nu_{2}}](e_{1}) = ((ap+bq)e_{1} + (bp+cq)e_{2}) - ((ap+bq)e_{1} + (aq+br)e_{2})\n$$\n$$\n= (bp+cq - aq-br)e_{2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the desired scalar by taking the inner product with $e_{2}$:\n$$\n\\Omega^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2}) = \\langle [S_{\\nu_{1}}, S_{\\nu_{2}}](e_{1}), e_{2} \\rangle = \\langle (bp+cq - aq-br)e_{2}, e_{2} \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $\\langle e_{2}, e_{2} \\rangle = 1$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Omega^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2}) = bp+cq-aq-br\n$$\nTo complete the first part of the problem, we can compute the matrix of $R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2})$ in the basis $\\{\\nu_{1}, \\nu_{2}\\}$. We already have one entry: $\\langle R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2})\\nu_{1}, \\nu_{2} \\rangle = bp+cq-aq-br$. Since $R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2})$ is a skew-adjoint operator on $N_p\\Sigma$, its matrix in an orthonormal basis must be skew-symmetric. Hence, $\\langle R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2})\\nu_{1}, \\nu_{1} \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2})\\nu_{2}, \\nu_{2} \\rangle = 0$. The remaining entry is:\n$$\n\\langle R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2})\\nu_{2}, \\nu_{1} \\rangle = - \\langle R^{\\perp}(e_{1}, e_{2})\\nu_{1}, \\nu_{2} \\rangle = -(bp+cq-aq-br) = aq+br-bp-cq\n$$\nSo the operator $R^{\\perp}(e_1, e_2)$ is described by:\n$R^{\\perp}(e_1, e_2)\\nu_1 = (bp+cq-aq-br)\\nu_2$\n$R^{\\perp}(e_1, e_2)\\nu_2 = (aq+br-bp-cq)\\nu_1$\nIts matrix in the basis $\\{\\nu_1, \\nu_2\\}$ is:\n$$\n[R^{\\perp}(e_1, e_2)] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & aq+br-bp-cq \\\\ bp+cq-aq-br & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis explicitly determines the normal curvature operator and relates its components to the algebraic expressions in $a, b, c, p, q, r$. The final answer required is the scalar $\\Omega^{\\perp}(e_1,e_2)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{bp+cq-aq-br} $$", "id": "2997232"}]}
