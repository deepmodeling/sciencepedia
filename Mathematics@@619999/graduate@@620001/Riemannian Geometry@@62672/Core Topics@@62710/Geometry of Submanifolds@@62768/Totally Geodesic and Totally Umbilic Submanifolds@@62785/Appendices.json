Express your final answer as the closed-form analytic expression for the shape operator at parameter $s$ in terms of $\\kappa(s)$, with no numerical approximation required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded within the framework of Riemannian geometry. All terms are standard and the premises are consistent. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the shape operator for a unit-speed curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and then to characterize when the curve is totally geodesic and totally umbilic.\n\nLet $\\gamma: I \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a smooth, embedded, unit-speed curve with arc-length parameter $s \\in I$. The ambient space is the Euclidean plane $(\\mathbb{R}^2, \\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle)$ with its standard flat Levi-Civita connection $\\overline{\\nabla}$.\n\nAt each point $\\gamma(s)$, we have a positively oriented orthonormal frame $\\{T(s), N(s)\\}$, where $T(s) = \\gamma'(s)$ is the unit tangent vector and $N(s)$ is the unit normal vector. Since they form an orthonormal basis for $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, we have:\n$$ \\langle T(s), T(s) \\rangle = 1 $$\n$$ \\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 1 $$\n$$ \\langle T(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\n\nThe curvature $\\kappa(s)$ of the curve is defined by the relation $\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} T(s) = \\kappa(s) N(s)$. The connection $\\overline{\\nabla}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is flat, so for a vector field $V$ along $\\gamma$, $\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)}V(s)$ is simply the ordinary derivative of the vector components with respect to $s$, i.e., $V'(s)$.\n\nOur first goal is to find an expression for the shape operator $S_s$. The shape operator (or Weingarten map) $S_s$ is a linear map on the tangent space of the submanifold, $S_s: T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I) \\to T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$. The tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$ is a one-dimensional vector space spanned by $T(s)$. The shape operator is defined by the formula $S_s(X) = -(\\overline{\\nabla}_X N)^\\top$ for any $X \\in T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$, where $(\\cdot)^\\top$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$.\n\nTo determine the action of $S_s$, we only need to compute $S_s(T(s))$. We begin by analyzing the vector $\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s)$. Let us differentiate the orthogonality condition $\\langle T(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0$ with respect to the arc-length parameter $s$. Using the product rule for the connection:\n$$ \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} \\langle T(s), N(s) \\rangle = \\langle \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} T(s), N(s) \\rangle + \\langle T(s), \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nSubstituting the definition $\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} T(s) = \\kappa(s) N(s)$:\n$$ \\langle \\kappa(s) N(s), N(s) \\rangle + \\langle T(s), \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nSince $N(s)$ is a unit vector, $\\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 1$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\kappa(s) + \\langle T(s), \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis gives the tangential component of $\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s)$:\n$$ \\langle T(s), \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = -\\kappa(s) $$\nNext, we determine the normal component. Any vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be decomposed with respect to the basis $\\{T(s), N(s)\\}$. So we can write:\n$$ \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s) = \\langle \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s), T(s) \\rangle T(s) + \\langle \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s), N(s) \\rangle N(s) $$\nTo find the coefficient of $N(s)$, we differentiate the condition $\\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 1$:\n$$ \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} \\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 2 \\langle \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis implies that $\\langle \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0$. Therefore, the vector $\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s)$ has no component in the normal direction $N(s)$; it is purely tangential.\nSubstituting the components back, we get:\n$$ \\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s) = (-\\kappa(s)) T(s) + (0) N(s) = -\\kappa(s) T(s) $$\nThis relation, along with $\\overline{\\nabla}_T T = \\kappa N$, constitutes the Frenet-Serret formulas for a plane curve.\n\nNow we can apply the definition of the shape operator:\n$$ S_s(T(s)) = -\\left(\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s)\\right)^\\top $$\nSubstituting the expression we found for $\\overline{\\nabla}_{T(s)} N(s)$:\n$$ S_s(T(s)) = -(-\\kappa(s) T(s))^\\top = (\\kappa(s) T(s))^\\top $$\nThe vector $\\kappa(s) T(s)$ is already in the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$. The orthogonal projection of a vector onto a subspace containing it is the vector itself. Thus, $(\\kappa(s) T(s))^\\top = \\kappa(s) T(s)$.\nThe action of the shape operator on the basis vector $T(s)$ is:\n$$ S_s(T(s)) = \\kappa(s) T(s) $$\nSince any vector $X \\in T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$ can be written as $X = cT(s)$ for some scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the action of $S_s$ on $X$ is $S_s(X) = S_s(cT(s)) = cS_s(T(s)) = c(\\kappa(s)T(s)) = \\kappa(s)(cT(s)) = \\kappa(s)X$.\nThis means the shape operator $S_s$ is simply scalar multiplication by the curvature $\\kappa(s)$ on the tangent space. In the basis $\\{T(s)\\}$, its matrix representation is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[\\kappa(s)]$.\n\nNext, we characterize the conditions for $\\gamma(I)$ to be totally geodesic and totally umbilic.\n\nA submanifold is **totally geodesic** if its second fundamental form, $h$, is identically zero. The second fundamental form is related to the shape operator by $\\langle h(X,Y), \\xi \\rangle = \\langle S_\\xi(X), Y \\rangle$ for any normal vector field $\\xi$. Thus, $h=0$ if and only if all shape operators are zero. For our curve, this means $S_s = 0$ for all $s \\in I$.\nFrom $S_s(T(s)) = \\kappa(s)T(s)$, the operator $S_s$ is the zero operator if and only if $\\kappa(s) = 0$.\nTherefore, the curve $\\gamma(I)$ is totally geodesic if and only if its curvature $\\kappa(s)$ is zero for all $s \\in I$. Geometrically, a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with zero curvature is a straight line, which is a geodesic in the Euclidean plane.\n\nA submanifold is **totally umbilic** at a point if its shape operator at that point is proportional to the identity map on the tangent space. That is, $S_p = \\lambda(p) \\cdot \\text{Id}_{T_pM}$ for some scalar function $\\lambda(p)$.\nFor our one-dimensional submanifold $\\gamma(I)$, the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$ at each point is one-dimensional. Any linear operator on a one-dimensional vector space is automatically a scalar multiple of the identity map. As we have shown, for any $X \\in T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$, $S_s(X) = \\kappa(s)X$. This is precisely the form $\\lambda(s) \\cdot \\text{Id}$ with $\\lambda(s) = \\kappa(s)$.\nTherefore, any smooth curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a totally umbilic submanifold at every point. The property of being totally umbilic is intrinsic to being a one-dimensional submanifold and imposes no constraints on the curvature function $\\kappa(s)$.\n\nFinally, we address the relationship between total umbilicity and the constancy of $\\kappa(s)$. As established, total umbilicity is always satisfied for any curve. The condition that $\\kappa(s)$ is a constant, say $\\kappa(s) = \\kappa_0$, is a stronger condition. It specifies that the curve is a totally umbilic submanifold with *constant mean curvature*. The mean curvature for a hypersurface is the trace of the shape operator, which in this one-dimensional case is just $\\kappa(s)$. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, curves with constant curvature $\\kappa_0 \\neq 0$ are arcs of circles with radius $1/|\\kappa_0|$, and curves with constant curvature $\\kappa_0 = 0$ are straight lines. So, total umbilicity does not imply constant $\\kappa(s)$, but constant $\\kappa(s)$ describes a special class of totally umbilic curves.\n\nThe final answer requested is the closed-form expression for the shape operator. This operator acts as scalar multiplication by $\\kappa(s)$, so the function $\\kappa(s)$ completely determines it.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\kappa(s)}\n$$", "id": "3005507"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, we now elevate our analysis to the more general setting of a totally umbilic hypersurface within a space form of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$.

Let $Z=N=\\partial_t$. Then $[X,N]=[\\partial_t,X]=0$ and $[Y,N]=[\\partial_t,Y]=0$. The Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ is also tangent to the fibers.

Therefore, $F_{t_0}$ is not totally geodesic.\n\nNext, we compute the squared pointwise norm $|B|^2$ of the second fundamental form. At any point $p \\in F_{t_0}$, this is defined as:\n$$|B|^2 = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n g(B(e_i, e_j), B(e_i, e_j))$$\nwhere $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $(T_p F_{t_0}, g_{ind})$. Orthonormality means $g_{ind}(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nWe first compute $B(e_i, e_j)$:\n$$B(e_i, e_j) = h(e_i, e_j)N = (-k \\, g_{ind}(e_i, e_j))N = -k\\delta_{ij}N$$\nNow we compute the term in the sum using the ambient metric $g$:\n$$g(B(e_i, e_j), B(e_i, e_j)) = g(-k\\delta_{ij}N, -k\\delta_{ij}N) = (-k\\delta_{ij})^2 g(N,N) = k^2\\delta_{ij}^2 g(N,N)$$\nSince $N=\\partial_t$ is a unit normal, $g(N,N)=1$. The Kronecker delta has the property $\\delta_{ij}^2 = \\delta_{ij}$. So the term becomes $k^2\\delta_{ij}$.\nSubstituting this back into the sum for $|B|^2$:\n$$|B|^2 = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n k^2\\delta_{ij}$$\nThe sum is non-zero only for terms where $i=j$. We can thus reduce the double summation to a single summation over $i$:\n$$|B|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n k^2\\delta_{ii} = \\sum_{i=1}^n k^2(1) = n k^2$$\nThe squared pointwise norm of the second fundamental form of $F_{t_0}$ is constant on the submanifold and is given by $n k^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n k^2}$$", "id": "3005508"}]}
