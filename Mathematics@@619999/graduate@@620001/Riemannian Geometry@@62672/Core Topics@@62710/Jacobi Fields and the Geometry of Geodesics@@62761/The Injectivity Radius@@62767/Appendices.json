Finally, we will compute the injectivity radius from the definition as the distance from $p$ to its cut locus.\n\nLet $S^{n} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : |x|=1\\}$ be the unit sphere. The standard round metric is induced by the Euclidean metric on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $p$ be a fixed point on $S^{n}$. Without loss of generality, we can choose a coordinate system in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $p$ is the \"North Pole\", i.e., $p = (0, 0, \\ldots, 1)$.

A unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p$ with an initial velocity vector $u \\in T_{p}S^{n}$ (where $|u|=1$) is parameterized by arc length $t$. Such a geodesic lies in the $2$-plane spanned by the orthogonal vectors $p$ and $u$. Its explicit form is given by:\n$$ \\gamma_{u}(t) = (\\cos t) p + (\\sin t) u $$\nLet's verify this.\n- $\\gamma_{u}(0) = (\\cos 0) p + (\\sin 0) u = p$. The geodesic starts at $p$.\n- The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{u}(t) = -(\\sin t) p + (\\cos t) u$.\n- The initial velocity is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{u}(0) = -(\\sin 0) p + (\\cos 0) u = u$.\n- The speed is $|\\dot{\\gamma}_{u}(t)|^{2} = (-\\sin t)^2 |p|^2 + (\\cos t)^2 |u|^2 - 2 \\sin t \\cos t (p \\cdot u)$. Since $p \\in S^n$ and $u \\in T_pS^n$, we have $|p|=1$, and $p$ is orthogonal to $u$, so $p \\cdot u=0$. As $|u|=1$, the speed squared is $\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1$. The geodesic has unit speed.\nThe distance along this geodesic from $p$ to the point $\\gamma_{u}(t)$ is simply the parameter $t$.\n\nThe Riemannian distance $d(x, y)$ between two points $x, y \\in S^{n}$ is the length of the shortest geodesic arc connecting them. This is equal to the central angle, in radians, between the vectors $x$ and $y$. Since $|x|=|y|=1$, this angle is given by $d(x, y) = \\arccos(x \\cdot y)$.\n\nNow, we analyze the condition for a geodesic segment to be minimizing. Let's compare the distance along the geodesic $\\gamma_u(t)$, which is $t$, with the spherical distance $d(p, \\gamma_u(t))$.\n$$ d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = \\arccos(p \\cdot \\gamma_{u}(t)) $$\n$$ p \\cdot \\gamma_{u}(t) = p \\cdot ((\\cos t) p + (\\sin t) u) = \\cos t (p \\cdot p) + \\sin t (p \\cdot u) = (\\cos t)(1) + (\\sin t)(0) = \\cos t $$\nSo, the spherical distance is $d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = \\arccos(\\cos t)$.\n\nWe must carefully evaluate this expression:\n- For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $\\arccos(\\cos t) = t$. In this interval, the distance along the geodesic, $t$, is equal to the shortest distance between its endpoints. Thus, the geodesic segment $\\gamma_{u}|_{[0, t]}$ is a minimizing geodesic for any $t \\in [0, \\pi]$.\n- For $t > \\pi$, let $t = \\pi + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. Then $d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = \\arccos(\\cos(\\pi + \\epsilon)) = \\arccos(-\\cos \\epsilon)$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$ and we consider geodesics that are not closed loops, we can assume $t \\in ( \\pi, 2\\pi)$. For this range, $\\arccos(\\cos t) = 2\\pi - t$. Thus, for $t > \\pi$, we have $d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = 2\\pi - t < t$. The distance along the geodesic is no longer the shortest distance between its endpoints.\n\nThis means that along any geodesic $\\gamma_{u}(t)$ starting from $p$, the first point at which it ceases to be distance-minimizing is at parameter value $t=\\pi$. The point itself is:\n$$ q_{\\text{cut}} = \\gamma_{u}(\\pi) = (\\cos \\pi) p + (\\sin \\pi) u = -p $$\nThis point is the antipodal point of $p$. Remarkably, this cut point is independent of the initial direction $u \\in T_{p}S^{n}$. Every geodesic starting at $p$ reaches the same cut point, $-p$, at the same distance $\\pi$.\n\nThe cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$ is the set of all such first cut points along all geodesics from $p$. Based on the above, $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$ is contained in the set $\\{-p\\}$.\n\nFurthermore, the cut locus also contains points $q$ for which there exist multiple minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$.\n- Let $q \\in S^{n}$ be a point such that $q \\neq p$ and $q \\neq -p$. The vectors $p$ and $q$ are linearly independent. They uniquely define a $2$-dimensional plane through the origin. The intersection of this plane with $S^{n}$ is a unique great circle passing through $p$ and $q$. This great circle provides two geodesic arcs connecting $p$ and $q$. One has length $\\theta = d(p,q) = \\arccos(p \\cdot q) < \\pi$, and the other has length $2\\pi - \\theta > \\pi$. Thus, there is a unique minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$.\n- Now consider the point $q = -p$. Any great circle passing through $p$ is defined by a $2$-plane spanned by $p$ and some vector $u \\in T_pS^n$. Since $-p$ is in this plane, any such great circle also passes through $-p$. The set of unit initial velocity vectors $u \\in T_pS^n$ forms a sphere $S^{n-1}$. Each choice of $u$ defines a distinct geodesic $\\gamma_u(t)$ that reaches $-p$ at a distance of $\\pi$. All these geodesics are minimizing up to $t=\\pi$. Therefore, there are infinitely many minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$ (if $n \\ge 2$; two if $n=1$), each of length $\\pi$.\n\nBased on both criteria (first point where a geodesic is no longer minimizing, and points with multiple minimizing geodesics), the cut locus of $p$ consists of exactly one point: the antipodal point.\n$$ \\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\} $$\n\nThe injectivity radius at a point $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is defined as the distance from $p$ to its cut locus: $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, \\operatorname{Cut}(p))$.\nSince $\\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, -p) $$\nThe distance between a point and its antipode on a unit sphere is half the circumference of a great circle. The central angle between $p$ and $-p$ is $\\pi$ radians.\n$$ d(p, -p) = \\arccos(p \\cdot (-p)) = \\arccos(-|p|^2) = \\arccos(-1) = \\pi $$\nTherefore, the injectivity radius at any point $p \\in S^{n}$ is $\\pi$.\n\nThis result can also be understood in terms of the exponential map $\\exp_{p}: T_{p}S^{n} \\to S^{n}$. The injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ is the supremum of radii $r > 0$ such that $\\exp_{p}$ restricted to the open ball $B_{r}(0) \\subset T_pS^n$ is a diffeomorphism. We found that for any unit vector $u \\in T_pS^n$, the geodesic $\\gamma_u(t)$ is minimizing for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$. The exponential map is given by $\\exp_{p}(v) = \\gamma_{v/|v|}(|v|)$. The map fails to be injective on the sphere of radius $\\pi$ in the tangent space, $\\{v \\in T_pS^n: |v|=\\pi\\}$, because all these vectors are mapped to the single point $-p$. For any two distinct vectors $v_1, v_2$ on this sphere, $\\exp_p(v_1) = \\exp_p(v_2) = -p$. Thus, $\\exp_p$ is not injective on any ball of radius $r > \\pi$. For $r \\in (0, \\pi]$, the map $\\exp_p$ on $B_r(0)$ is injective and an immersion, hence a diffeomorphism onto its image.
