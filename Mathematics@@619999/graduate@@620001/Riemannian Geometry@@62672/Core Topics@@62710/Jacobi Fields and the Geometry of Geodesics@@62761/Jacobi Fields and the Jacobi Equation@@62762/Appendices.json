The Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field therefore reduces to the simpler second-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nJ'' + k J = 0.\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we consider a basis for the normal bundle of $\\gamma$. Let $\\{E_1(0), \\dots, E_{n-1}(0)\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ in the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(0)}M$.

A tangential Jacobi field has the form $(at+b)\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The condition $J(0)=0$ implies $b=0$, and $J(t_0)=0$ for $t_00$ implies $a=0$. Thus, the only tangential Jacobi field vanishing at two distinct points is the trivial one. Consequently, any nontrivial Jacobi field witnessing a conjugate point must be a normal Jacobi field.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions to our solutions $j_i(t)$:\n1. $J(0) = 0 \\implies j_i(0)=0$ for all $i$.\n$j_i(0) = A_i \\cos(0) + B_i \\sin(0) = A_i$.

The multiplicity is the dimension of the vector space of Jacobi fields $J$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_1)=0$. As we have shown, any such Jacobi field must be normal and of the form\n$$\nJ(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) E_i(t).\n$$\nFor $t=t_1 = \\pi/\\sqrt{k}$, we have $\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t_1)=\\sin(\\pi)=0$, so the condition $J(t_1)=0$ is satisfied for any choice of coefficients $B_i$.\nThe space of such Jacobi fields is spanned by the set of fields $\\{ \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)E_1(t), \\dots, \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)E_{n-1}(t) \\}$.

Since $g(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = g_{11}=1$, this is indeed a unit-speed curve (and it can be verified to be a geodesic).\n\nFor a two-dimensional manifold, the Riemann curvature term simplifies considerably:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K \\left( g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})J - g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nGiven that $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 1$.

So $j'(0)=1 \\implies C_1 = 1$.\n- The solution is $j(t) = t$.\n- At $L=2$, $j(2) = 2$.\n\n#### Case D (Variable Curvature)\n- $f(t)=R + r \\cos(t/r)$ with $R=2, r=0.5$.\n- $f'(t) = -\\sin(t/r)$.\n- $f''(t) = -(1/r)\\cos(t/r)$.\n- $K(t) = -f''(t)/f(t) = \\frac{(1/r)\\cos(t/r)}{R+r\\cos(t/r)}$.\n- The ODE is $j''(t) + \\frac{(1/r)\\cos(t/r)}{R+r\\cos(t/r)}j(t) = 0$.\n- This linear second-order ODE with variable coefficients does not have a simple analytical solution. It must be solved numerically. We convert it to a system of two first-order ODEs. Let $y_1(t) = j(t)$ and $y_2(t) = j'(t)$.\n- The system is:\n  $$\n  y_1' = y_2\n  $$\n  $$\n  y_2' = -K(t) y_1 = -\\left(\\frac{(1/r)\\cos(t/r)}{R+r\\cos(t/r)}\\right) y_1\n  $$\n- The initial conditions are $y_1(0)=j(0)=0$ and $y_2(0)=j'(0)=1$.\n- We integrate this system from $t=0$ to $L=1.5$ to find $j(1.5) = y_1(1.5)$.
