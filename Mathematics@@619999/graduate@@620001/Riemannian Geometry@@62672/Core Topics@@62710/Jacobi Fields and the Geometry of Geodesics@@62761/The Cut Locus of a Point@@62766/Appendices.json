At $t=\\pi$, $\\sin\\pi=0$ and $\\cos\\pi=-1$, so $r(\\pi)=0$ and $z(\\pi)=0$, hence $X(\\pi,\\varphi)=(0,0,0)$.\n\nOn a surface of revolution, any geodesic satisfies Clairautâ€™s relation $r\\sin\\beta=c$, where $\\beta$ is the angle between the geodesic and the meridian and $c$ is constant along the geodesic. For geodesics issuing from $P$ one has $r(0)=0$, hence $c=0$. For $s>0$ small along such a geodesic, $r>0$ (see below), so $r\\sin\\beta=0$ forces $\\sin\\beta=0$, i.e., $\\beta=0$ and the geodesic coincides with a meridian. Therefore all geodesics from $P$ are precisely the meridians $t\\mapsto X(t,\\varphi_{0})$ for fixed $\\varphi_{0}$.\n\nNext, determine the first conjugate point to $P$ along a meridian. The rotation vector field about the $z$-axis is a Killing field; restricting the associated variation to a meridian produces a normal Jacobi field $J$ whose length equals $r$ along the meridian (a rotation by angle $\\delta\\varphi$ displaces a point by distance $r\\,\\delta\\varphi$ along the parallel). Thus $J$ vanishes exactly where $r=0$. We have $r(0)=0$ at $P$, and for $t\\in(0,\\pi)$,\n$$r(t)=a(1+\\cos t)\\sin t>0,$$\nsince $1+\\cos t>0$ and $\\sin t>0$. Hence there is no zero of $r$ in $(0,\\pi)$, and the next zero occurs at $t=\\pi$, where $r(\\pi)=0$. Therefore the first conjugate point to $P$ along any meridian is $X(\\pi,\\varphi)=(0,0,0)$.\n\nBefore the first conjugate point, a geodesic from $P$ is minimizing. Moreover, because points off the axis lie on exactly one meridian (fixed $\\varphi$), there is a unique minimizing geodesic from $P$ to any point with $r>0$, so no off-axis point belongs to the cut locus. At $t=\\pi$, all meridians meet at the single point $(0,0,0)$, producing infinitely many minimizing geodesics of equal length from $P$ to this point. Consequently, the cut locus of $P$ consists exactly of the single point $(0,0,0)$.\n\nThus, in Cartesian coordinates, the cut locus is the $1\\times 3$ row matrix $(0,0,0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1673562"}]}
