The solution process may proceed.\n\nA conjugate point $\\gamma(s)$ to $\\gamma(0)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is detected by the existence of a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ that vanishes at $t=0$ and $t=s$. The problem specifies that this Jacobi field must be normal, i.e., $\\langle J(t), T(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,s]$, where $T(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$.\n\nThe Jacobi equation for a vector field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$ \\nabla_T \\nabla_T J + R(J, T)T = 0 $$\nwhere $\\nabla_T$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nThe manifold is the unit sphere $(S^n, g_{\\text{round}})$ with constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor has the specific form:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y) $$\nIn our case, $K=1$, so for the vector fields $J$ and $T$, we have:\n$$ R(J,T)T = 1 \\cdot (\\langle T,T \\rangle J - \\langle J,T \\rangle T) $$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, its tangent vector $T$ has unit length, so $\\langle T,T \\rangle = 1$. The problem requires $J$ to be a normal Jacobi field, which means $\\langle J,T \\rangle = 0$. Substituting these conditions into the expression for $R(J,T)T$:\n$$ R(J,T)T = (1)J - (0)T = J $$\nThus, for a normal Jacobi field on the unit sphere, the Jacobi equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$ \\nabla_T \\nabla_T J + J = 0 $$\nThis is a vector-valued second-order linear ordinary differential equation. To solve it, we can choose a convenient basis. Let $\\{E_1(t), \\dots, E_{n-1}(t)\\}$ be a parallel orthonormal frame for the normal bundle along $\\gamma$. That is, for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, $\\nabla_T E_i(t) = 0$ and $\\langle E_i(t), E_j(t) \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$. Any normal vector field $J(t)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis fields:\n$$ J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i(t) E_i(t) $$\nwhere $j_i(t)$ are scalar functions. We compute the covariant derivatives of $J$:\n$$ \\nabla_T J = \\nabla_T \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i(t) E_i(t) \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{dj_i}{dt} E_i(t) + j_i(t) \\nabla_T E_i(t) \\right) $$\nSince the frame is parallel, $\\nabla_T E_i(t) = 0$, so:\n$$ \\nabla_T J = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i'(t) E_i(t) $$\nwhere $j_i'(t)$ denotes $\\frac{dj_i}{dt}$. Differentiating again:\n$$ \\nabla_T \\nabla_T J = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i''(t) E_i(t) $$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Jacobi equation $\\nabla_T \\nabla_T J + J = 0$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i''(t) E_i(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i(t) E_i(t) = 0 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (j_i''(t) + j_i(t)) E_i(t) = 0 $$\nSince $\\{E_i(t)\\}$ is a basis for the normal space at each point $\\gamma(t)$, the coefficients must be zero. This yields a system of $n-1$ independent scalar ODEs:\n$$ j_i''(t) + j_i(t) = 0, \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, n-1 $$\nThe general solution for each component is $j_i(t) = a_i \\cos(t) + b_i \\sin(t)$ for some constants $a_i$ and $b_i$.\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions given in the definition of a conjugate point.\n1.  $J(0) = 0$:\n    $J(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i(0) E_i(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (a_i \\cos(0) + b_i \\sin(0)) E_i(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i E_i(0)$.\n    For $J(0)$ to be the zero vector, we must have $a_i=0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n    Thus, any normal Jacobi field vanishing at $t=0$ must be of the form $J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} b_i \\sin(t) E_i(t)$.\n\n2.  $J(s) = 0$ for some $s0$:\n    $J(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} b_i \\sin(s) E_i(s) = (\\sin(s)) \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} b_i E_i(s) = 0$.\n\nThe problem requires a *nontrivial* Jacobi field, which means that $J(t)$ is not identically zero. This implies that at least one coefficient $b_i$ must be non-zero. If at least one $b_i \\neq 0$, the vector $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} b_i E_i(s)$ is a non-zero vector (since the frame fields $E_i(s)$ are orthonormal). Therefore, for the equation $(\\sin(s)) \\sum b_i E_i(s) = 0$ to hold, the scalar factor $\\sin(s)$ must be zero.\n$$ \\sin(s) = 0 $$\nThe solutions for $s0$ are $s = k\\pi$ for any positive integer $k$. The smallest positive value for $s$ is obtained by taking $k=1$, which gives $s=\\pi$.\n\nThis shows that the first possible time for a conjugate point to appear is $s=\\pi$. We must now verify that no conjugate points appear before this time, as requested by the second part of the problem. This is done by analyzing the index form.\n\nThe index form $I_{s'}$ of the geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0, s']}$ evaluates the second variation of energy. For a proper normal variation field $V$ (meaning $V$ is a normal vector field along $\\gamma$ with $V(0)=0$ and $V(s')=0$), the index form is:\n$$ I_{s'}(V,V) = \\int_0^{s'} \\left( \\langle \\nabla_T V, \\nabla_T V \\rangle - \\langle R(V,T)T, V \\rangle \\right) dt $$\nAs established earlier, for a normal field $V$ on a space with $K=1$, we have $\\langle R(V,T)T, V \\rangle = \\langle V, V \\rangle = \\|V\\|^2$. The index form simplifies to:\n$$ I_{s'}(V,V) = \\int_0^{s'} \\left( \\|\\nabla_T V\\|^2 - \\|V\\|^2 \\right) dt $$\nWe want to show that for $0  s'  \\pi$, this form is positive definite, i.e., $I_{s'}(V,V)0$ for any non-trivial proper normal variation $V$.\nExpressing $V$ in the parallel frame $V(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i(t) E_i(t)$, where $v_i(0)=v_i(s')=0$, we have $\\|\\nabla_T V\\|^2 = \\sum_i (v_i'(t))^2$ and $\\|V\\|^2 = \\sum_i (v_i(t))^2$. The index form becomes a sum of integrals:\n$$ I_{s'}(V,V) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\int_0^{s'} \\left( (v_i'(t))^2 - (v_i(t))^2 \\right) dt $$\nThe sign of $I_{s'}(V,V)$ depends on the sign of each integral. For any scalar function $v(t)$ of class $C^1$ on $[0,s']$ with $v(0)=v(s')=0$ and $v$ not identically zero, a standard result from calculus of variations (a form of Wirtinger's inequality or Poincar√© inequality on an interval) states that:\n$$ \\int_0^{s'} (v'(t))^2 dt \\ge \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{s'}\\right)^2 \\int_0^{s'} (v(t))^2 dt $$\nEquality holds if and only if $v(t)$ is a multiple of $\\sin(\\pi t/s')$.\nUsing this inequality, we can bound each term in the sum for $I_{s'}(V,V)$:\n$$ \\int_0^{s'} \\left( (v_i'(t))^2 - (v_i(t))^2 \\right) dt \\ge \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{s'}\\right)^2 - 1 \\right] \\int_0^{s'} (v_i(t))^2 dt $$\nWe are given that $0  s'  \\pi$. This implies $\\frac{1}{s'}  \\frac{1}{\\pi}$, so $\\frac{\\pi}{s'}  1$, and consequently $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{s'}\\right)^2  1$. The prefactor is therefore strictly positive:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{s'}\\right)^2 - 1  0 $$\nSince $V$ is a non-trivial variation, at least one component $v_i(t)$ is not identically zero, which means $\\int_0^{s'} (v_i(t))^2 dt  0$ for that component. For all other components, the integral is non-negative.\nTherefore,\n$$ I_{s'}(V,V) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\int_0^{s'} \\left( (v_i'(t))^2 - (v_i(t))^2 \\right) dt  0 $$\nThis confirms that for $0  s'  \\pi$, the index form is positive definite on the space of nontrivial normal variations with vanishing endpoints.\n\nAccording to the Morse Index Theorem, the index of a geodesic segment (the number of conjugate points in its interior, counted with multiplicity) is equal to the index of the index form (the dimension of the largest subspace of variations on which the form is negative definite). Since the index form is positive definite for $s'\\pi$, its index is $0$. This implies that there are no conjugate points to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ in the interval $(0, \\pi)$.\nTherefore, the smallest positive time $s$ for which a conjugate point exists is indeed $s=\\pi$. This corresponds geometrically to the geodesic reaching the point antipodal to its starting point on the great circle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "2989384"}, {"introduction": "In stark contrast to the sphere, hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is the canonical model for constant negative curvature, where geodesics perpetually diverge.

All necessary information is provided, and the tasks form a logical sequence of standard derivations and calculations.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Solution of the Jacobi Equation**\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of a manifold with constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by\n$$R(X, Y)Z = K(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y)$$\nfor any vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. In our case, $(\\mathbb{H}^n, g)$ has constant sectional curvature $K = -1$. Thus,\n$$R(X, Y)Z = -(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y) = \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y - \\langle Y, Z \\rangle X.$$\n\nA Jacobi field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$D_t^2 J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0,$$\nwhere $D_t$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $t$ is the arc-length parameter. Since $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, we have $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\| = 1$ for all $t$.\n\nWe consider a normal Jacobi field $J$, which satisfies $\\langle J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$. Let's compute the curvature term $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} - \\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle J.$$\nUsing the conditions $\\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle = 1$, we get:\n$$R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = (0)\\dot{\\gamma} - (1)J = -J.$$\nSubstituting this back into the Jacobi equation gives:\n$$D_t^2 J - J = 0.$$\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation for the vector field $J$. To solve it, we can work in a basis of parallel vector fields. Let $Y = J(0)$ and $Z = D_t J(0)$. The problem states that $Y$ and $Z$ lie in the normal space to $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$. Let $Y(t)$ and $Z(t)$ be the parallel vector fields along $\\gamma$ obtained by parallel transport of $Y$ and $Z$ from $t=0$.\n\nThe general solution to the vector-valued differential equation $D_t^2 J - J = 0$ is analogous to the scalar case and can be written as\n$$J(t) = (\\cosh t) A(t) + (\\sinh t) B(t),$$\nwhere $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are parallel vector fields along $\\gamma$.\nTo find $A(t)$ and $B(t)$, we use the initial conditions at $t=0$:\n$$J(0) = (\\cosh 0) A(0) + (\\sinh 0) B(0) = A(0).$$\nSo, $A(0) = J(0) = Y$. Since $A(t)$ is parallel, $A(t)$ is the parallel transport of $Y$.\nNext, we compute the covariant derivative of $J(t)$:\n$$D_t J(t) = (\\sinh t) A(t) + (\\cosh t) B(t) + (\\cosh t) D_t A(t) + (\\sinh t) D_t B(t).$$\nSince $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are parallel, $D_t A(t) = 0$ and $D_t B(t) = 0$. So,\n$$D_t J(t) = (\\sinh t) A(t) + (\\cosh t) B(t).$$\nEvaluating at $t=0$:\n$$D_t J(0) = (\\sinh 0) A(0) + (\\cosh 0) B(0) = B(0).$$\nSo, $B(0) = D_t J(0) = Z$. Since $B(t)$ is parallel, $B(t)$ is the parallel transport of $Z$.\n\nThus, the unique solution for the normal Jacobi field $J(t)$ with initial conditions $J(0) = Y$ and $D_t J(0) = Z$ is:\n$$J(t) = (\\cosh t) Y(t) + (\\sinh t) Z(t),$$\nwhere $Y(t)$ and $Z(t)$ are the parallel transports of the initial vectors $Y$ and $Z$ along $\\gamma$.\n\n**Part 2: Absence of Conjugate Points**\n\nA point $\\gamma(L)$ with $L0$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(L)=0$. The Jacobi field must be normal for this analysis on spaces of constant negative curvature.\n\nUsing the solution from Part 1, we apply the condition $J(0) = 0$:\n$$J(0) = Y = 0.$$\nThis simplifies the solution to $J(t) = (\\sinh t) Z(t)$.\nNow, we apply the second condition, $J(L)=0$:\n$$J(L) = (\\sinh L) Z(L) = 0.$$\nThe problem specifies that $L  0$. For $L0$, the hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(L) \\neq 0$. Therefore, for the product to be zero, we must have $Z(L)=0$.\nThe vector field $Z(t)$ is the parallel transport of the initial vector $Z=Z(0)$. Parallel transport is an isometry, meaning it preserves the norm of vectors. So, $\\|Z(t)\\| = \\|Z(0)\\|$ for all $t$.\nIf $Z(L)=0$, then $\\|Z(L)\\|=0$. This implies $\\|Z(0)\\|=0$, which means $Z=Z(0)=0$.\nThe initial conditions are $Y=0$ and $Z=0$. These initial conditions for the second-order linear ODE $D_t^2 J - J = 0$ yield the unique solution $J(t) = 0$ for all $t$. This is the trivial Jacobi field.\nSince any Jacobi field vanishing at $t=0$ and $t=L$ must be the trivial field, there are no non-trivial Jacobi fields with these properties. Consequently, there are no points conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ in $\\mathbb{H}^n$.\n\n**Part 3: Positive Definiteness of the Index Form**\n\nThe index form $I$ is a symmetric bilinear form on the space of piecewise smooth vector fields along $\\gamma$ that are orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$. For two such vector fields $V$ and $W$, it is defined via the second variation of energy:\n$$I(V, W) = \\int_0^L \\left( \\langle D_t V, D_t W \\rangle - \\langle R(W, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\right) dt.$$\nWe are interested in the quadratic form $I(V,V)$ for smooth normal vector fields $V$ with $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=0$.\n$$I(V, V) = \\int_0^L \\left( \\langle D_t V, D_t V \\rangle - \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\right) dt.$$\nFrom Part 1, we know that for a normal field $V$, $R(V, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = -V$. Substituting this into the expression for $I(V,V)$:\n$$I(V, V) = \\int_0^L \\left( \\|D_t V\\|^2 - \\langle -V, V \\rangle \\right) dt = \\int_0^L \\left( \\|D_t V\\|^2 + \\|V\\|^2 \\right) dt.$$\nThe integrand, $\\|D_t V(t)\\|^2 + \\|V(t)\\|^2$, is a sum of squares of norms, so it is non-negative for all $t \\in [0, L]$. Therefore, the integral $I(V,V)$ must be non-negative.\nTo show positive definiteness, we must show that $I(V,V)=0$ if and only if $V(t)=0$ for all $t$.\nIf $V(t)=0$ for all $t$, then $D_tV=0$ and $\\|V\\|=0$, so the integrand is zero, and $I(V,V)=0$.\nConversely, suppose $I(V,V)=0$.\n$$ \\int_0^L \\left( \\|D_t V(t)\\|^2 + \\|V(t)\\|^2 \\right) dt = 0.$$\nSince the vector field $V$ is smooth, the integrand is a continuous function of $t$. As the integrand is non-negative, its integral can be zero only if the integrand itself is identically zero for all $t \\in [0,L]$.\n$$\\|D_t V(t)\\|^2 + \\|V(t)\\|^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\in [0,L].$$\nThis equality holds if and only if both terms are zero simultaneously:\n$$\\|D_t V(t)\\|^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\|V(t)\\|^2 = 0.$$\nThe condition $\\|V(t)\\|^2 = 0$ implies that $V(t)=0$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$.\nThus, $I(V,V)=0$ occurs only for the trivial vector field $V=0$. This proves that the index form $I$ is positive definite on the space of smooth normal vector fields $V$ along $\\gamma$ satisfying $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=0$.\n\n**Part 4: Evaluation of the Index Form**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $I(V,V)$ for the specific vector field $V(t) = f(t)E(t)$, where $f(t) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right)$ and $E(t)$ is a parallel unit normal vector field along $\\gamma$.\nThe boundary conditions are satisfied: $V(0) = \\sin(0)E(0) = 0$ and $V(L) = \\sin(\\pi)E(L) = 0$.\n\nFrom Part 3, the formula for the index form is:\n$$I(V, V) = \\int_0^L \\left( \\|D_t V\\|^2 + \\|V\\|^2 \\right) dt.$$\nWe compute the two terms in the integrand.\nFirst, the norm of $V$:\n$$\\|V(t)\\|^2 = \\|f(t) E(t)\\|^2 = (f(t))^2 \\|E(t)\\|^2.$$\nSince $E(t)$ is a unit vector field, $\\|E(t)\\|=1$. Therefore,\n$$\\|V(t)\\|^2 = (f(t))^2 = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right).$$\nNext, the covariant derivative of $V$:\n$$D_t V(t) = D_t (f(t) E(t)) = \\frac{df}{dt} E(t) + f(t) D_t E(t).$$\nSince $E(t)$ is a parallel vector field, its covariant derivative is zero: $D_t E(t) = 0$. So,\n$$D_t V(t) = \\frac{df}{dt} E(t) = \\dot{f}(t) E(t).$$\nThe norm-squared of the derivative is:\n$$\\|D_t V(t)\\|^2 = \\|\\dot{f}(t) E(t)\\|^2 = (\\dot{f}(t))^2 \\|E(t)\\|^2 = (\\dot{f}(t))^2.$$\nWe compute $\\dot{f}(t)$:\n$$\\dot{f}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right).$$\nSo,\n$$\\|D_t V(t)\\|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right).$$\nNow we can set up the integral for $I(V,V)$:\n$$I(V,V) = \\int_0^L \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right] dt.$$\nWe evaluate the two integral parts separately.\n$$\\int_0^L \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) dt = \\int_0^L \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{L}\\right)\\right) dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ t + \\frac{L}{2\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right]_0^L = \\frac{1}{2}(L+0 - 0) = \\frac{L}{2}.$$\n$$\\int_0^L \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) dt = \\int_0^L \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{L}\\right)\\right) dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ t - \\frac{L}{2\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right]_0^L = \\frac{1}{2}(L-0 - 0) = \\frac{L}{2}.$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $I(V,V)$:\n$$I(V,V) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) + \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2L} + \\frac{L}{2}.$$\nThis can be written as a single fraction:\n$$I(V,V) = \\frac{\\pi^2 + L^2}{2L}.$$\nThis is the final expression for the index form evaluated for the given vector field.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\pi^2 + L^2}{2L} } $$", "id": "2989380"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond spaces of constant curvature, this exercise investigates how the index form behaves on a product manifold, $S^k \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$.

The derivative terms $(f')^{2}$ and $(g')^{2}$ reflect the variation energy in each factor and are independent of curvature, while the negative curvature term $-a^{2} f^{2}$ reduces the index due to the positive curvature of $S^{k}$ along directions normal to $\\sigma'$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\tfrac{5\\pi^{2}}{2L}\\;-\\;\\tfrac{a^{2}L}{2}}$$", "id": "2989379"}]}
