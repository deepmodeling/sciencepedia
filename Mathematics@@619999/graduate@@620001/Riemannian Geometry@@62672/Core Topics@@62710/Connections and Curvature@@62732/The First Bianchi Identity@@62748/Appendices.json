The antisymmetry of the covariant tensor translates to the contravariant tensor. Let's show this explicitly. The antisymmetry $R_{pqrs} = -R_{pqsr}$ implies:\n$R^{acbd} = g^{ap}g^{cq}g^{br}g^{ds} R_{pqrs} = g^{ap}g^{cq}g^{br}g^{ds} (-R_{pqsr})$.\nWe can relabel the dummy summation indices $r$ and $s$.
