It is a standard, well-posed problem illustrating the relationship between curvature and holonomy. All terms are defined precisely, and the setup is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. The problem avoids pseudoscience, non-formalizable analogies, and subjectivity. It is not trivial, as it requires the application of fundamental principles of parallel transport on a curved manifold.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, the computation of the holonomy angle $\\Theta$, and second, the calculation of the angle defect of the spherical triangle $T_{\\varphi_0}$ and the establishment of its equality with $\\Theta$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Holonomy Angle $\\Theta$**\n\nThe holonomy around the closed loop $\\gamma$ is the total rotation experienced by a vector that is parallel transported along the curve. We can determine this rotation by tracking the orientation of a chosen initial vector at the north pole $N$ as it moves along the three geodesic segments of $\\gamma$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_N S^2_R$ at the north pole $N(\\theta=0)$ can be identified with the $xy$-plane in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A tangent vector at $N$ can be specified by the direction in which it points, corresponding to an initial longitude. We will use the angle $\\psi$ to denote the direction of a vector in $T_N S^2_R$, where $\\psi$ corresponds to the initial meridian $\\varphi=\\psi$ that the vector is tangent to.\n\nLet's choose an initial vector $V_N$ at the north pole $N$ that points in the direction of the meridian $\\varphi=\\pi/2$. In the tangent plane at $N$, this corresponds to an angle of $\\pi/2$.\n\nWe now parallel transport $V_N$ along the three segments of $\\gamma$:\n\n1.  **Transport along $\\gamma_1$ (meridian from $N$ to $A$):**\n    The path $\\gamma_1$ is the segment of the meridian $\\varphi=0$ from $N(\\theta=0)$ down to $A(\\theta=\\pi/2, \\varphi=0)$. Meridians on a surface of revolution are geodesics. A key property of parallel transport along a meridian on a surface of revolution is that the angle between the transported vector and the meridian remains constant.\n    Our initial vector $V_N$ points along the direction $\\varphi=\\pi/2$, while the path $\\gamma_1$ is along $\\varphi=0$. The angle between the initial directions of these two meridians at the pole is $\\pi/2$. Thus, $V_N$ is orthogonal to the tangent vector of $\\gamma_1$ at $N$.\n    This orthogonality is preserved during parallel transport along $\\gamma_1$. When the vector reaches point $A$ on the equator, the transported vector, let's call it $V_A$, will be orthogonal to the tangent of the meridian $\\varphi=0$ at $A$. The tangent to the meridian at $A$ points south (increasing $\\theta$). The direction orthogonal to this in the tangent plane $T_A S^2_R$ is along the equator (constant $\\theta$). Therefore, $V_A$ is tangent to the equator at $A$, pointing in the direction of increasing longitude $\\varphi$.\n\n2.  **Transport along $\\gamma_2$ (equator from $A$ to $B$):**\n    The path $\\gamma_2$ is the arc of the equator from $A(\\theta=\\pi/2, \\varphi=0)$ to $B(\\theta=\\pi/2, \\varphi=\\varphi_0)$. The equator is a great circle and thus also a geodesic on the sphere.\n    The vector $V_A$ arrives at $A$ tangent to the equator. When a vector that is tangent to a geodesic is parallel transported along that same geodesic, it remains tangent to it.\n    Therefore, as we transport the vector from $A$ to $B$ along the equator, it remains tangent to the equator. At point $B$, the resulting vector $V_B$ is tangent to the equator.\n\n3.  **Transport along $\\gamma_3$ (meridian from $B$ to $N$):**\n    The path $\\gamma_3$ is the segment of the meridian $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$ from $B$ back to the north pole $N$. This is also a geodesic.\n    At point $B$, the vector $V_B$ is tangent to the equator. The meridian $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$ is orthogonal to the equator at $B$. Thus, the vector $V_B$ is orthogonal to the tangent vector of the path $\\gamma_3$ at $B$.\n    As the vector is transported along the meridian $\\gamma_3$ back to the pole $N$, the angle between the vector and the meridian is preserved. Since it starts orthogonal, it remains orthogonal throughout the transport. Upon returning to the north pole $N$, the final vector $V_{N'}$ is orthogonal to the tangent of the meridian $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$.\n\n**Net Rotation:**\nWe can now calculate the total rotation angle $\\Theta$.\n-   The initial vector $V_N$ at the pole $N$ pointed in the direction of the meridian $\\varphi=\\pi/2$. This corresponds to an angle of $\\pi/2$ in the tangent plane $T_N S^2_R$.\n-   The final vector $V_{N'}$ at the pole $N$ is orthogonal to the direction of the meridian $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$. The direction corresponding to the meridian $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$ is at an angle $\\varphi_0$. The direction orthogonal to this (in the same orientation as the initial setup) is at an angle $\\varphi_0 + \\pi/2$.\n-   The net rotation angle $\\Theta$ is the final angle minus the initial angle:\n    $$ \\Theta = \\left(\\varphi_0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\varphi_0 $$\nThe holonomy angle is $\\Theta = \\varphi_0$. Note that this result is independent of the radius $R$.\n\nThis result can be confirmed using the relation between holonomy and curvature. The holonomy angle is given by the integral of the Gaussian curvature $K$ over the enclosed area $A_T$: $\\Theta = \\int_T K dA$. For a sphere of radius $R$, the curvature is constant, $K = 1/R^2$. The area of the spherical triangle $T_{\\varphi_0}$ is given by the integral of the area element $dA = R^2\\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\varphi$ over the region $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi/2$ and $0 \\le \\varphi \\le \\varphi_0$.\n$$ A_T = \\int_0^{\\varphi_0} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} R^2 \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta\\,d\\varphi = R^2 \\int_0^{\\varphi_0} [-\\cos\\theta]_0^{\\pi/2} \\,d\\varphi = R^2 \\int_0^{\\varphi_0} 1 \\,d\\varphi = R^2\\varphi_0 $$\nThe holonomy angle is then $\\Theta = K \\cdot A_T = (1/R^2) \\cdot (R^2\\varphi_0) = \\varphi_0$, which confirms our direct calculation.\n\n**Part 2: Angle Defect and Relation to Holonomy**\n\nThe problem asks to relate this holonomy angle to the angle defect of the geodesic triangle $T_{\\varphi_0}$. The angle defect is defined as the sum of the interior angles minus $\\pi$. Let the interior angles at vertices $N$, $A$, and $B$ be $I_N$, $I_A$, and $I_B$ respectively.\n\n1.  **Angle at $A$ ($I_A$):** The vertex $A$ is the intersection of the meridian $\\varphi=0$ and the equator $\\theta=\\pi/2$. In the given orthogonal coordinate system, the coordinate lines are orthogonal where the metric is diagonal. Since $g_{\\theta\\varphi}=0$, the tangent vectors $\\partial/\\partial\\theta$ and $\\partial/\\partial\\varphi$ are orthogonal. Thus, the angle between the meridian and the equator at $A$ is $I_A = \\pi/2$.\n\n2.  **Angle at $B$ ($I_B$):** Similarly, the vertex $B$ is the intersection of the meridian $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$ and the equator $\\theta=\\pi/2$. For the same reason, the angle between these two geodesics is $I_B = \\pi/2$.\n\n3.  **Angle at $N$ ($I_N$):** The vertex $N$ is the intersection of the meridian $\\varphi=0$ and the meridian $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$. The angle between two meridians at a pole is equal to the absolute difference of their longitudes. To see this, consider the tangent vectors to the meridians in the tangent plane at the pole. The tangent vector to a meridian with longitude $\\varphi$ points in the direction given by the angle $\\varphi$ in the polar coordinate system of the tangent plane. The angle between the directions $\\varphi=0$ and $\\varphi=\\varphi_0$ is therefore $I_N = |\\varphi_0 - 0| = \\varphi_0$.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles is:\n$$ I = I_N + I_A + I_B = \\varphi_0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\varphi_0 + \\pi $$\n\nThe angle defect $D$ is defined as this sum minus $\\pi$:\n$$ D = I - \\pi = (\\varphi_0 + \\pi) - \\pi = \\varphi_0 $$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have computed the holonomy angle to be $\\Theta = \\varphi_0$ and the angle defect of the triangle to be $D = \\varphi_0$. Therefore, we have explicitly shown the equality:\n$$ \\Theta = D $$\nThis equality is a manifestation of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature over a region is equal to $2\\pi$ minus the sum of the exterior angles of its geodesic boundary. For a geodesic triangle, this simplifies to the integral of the curvature being equal to the angle defect. The holonomy provides a physical interpretation of this integrated curvature as the net rotation experienced by a vector traversing the boundary, fundamentally linking the local geometry (curvature) to a global topological effect (angle defect and holonomy).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\varphi_{0}}$$", "id": "2985820"}]}
