The inverse metric components are $g^{ij} = e^{-2u(x)} \\delta^{ij}$. The standard coordinates are Euclidean, so the partial derivative $\\partial_k$ with respect to $x^k$ commutes with $\\delta_{ij}$.

First, we evaluate the Kulkarni–Nomizu product $g \\wedge g$. For two symmetric tensors $h=k=g$, the definition given in the problem becomes:\n$$ (g \\wedge g)_{ijkl} = g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk} + g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk} = 2(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk}) $$\nSubstituting $g_{ij}=e^{2u}\\delta_{ij}$:\n$$ (g \\wedge g)_{ijkl} = 2(e^{2u}\\delta_{ik} e^{2u}\\delta_{jl} - e^{2u}\\delta_{il} e^{2u}\\delta_{jk}) = 2e^{4u}(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) $$\nThe condition $R_{ijkl} = K (g \\wedge g)_{ijkl}$ becomes:\n$$ R_{ijkl} = 2K e^{4u}(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) $$\nEquating this with our derived expression for $R_{ijkl}$ from Part 1:\n$$ e^{2u} [(A_{il}\\delta_{jk} - A_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + A_{jk}\\delta_{il} - A_{jl}\\delta_{ik}) + |\\nabla u|^2(\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk} - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl})] = 2K e^{4u}(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) $$\nDividing by $e^{2u}$ and rearranging the terms involving $\\delta$:\n$$ (A_{il}\\delta_{jk} - A_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + A_{jk}\\delta_{il} - A_{jl}\\delta_{ik}) - |\\nabla u|^2(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) = 2Ke^{2u}(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) $$\nFor this equality to hold for all indices (given $n \\ge 3$), the tensor $A_{ij}$ must be proportional to the Euclidean metric $\\delta_{ij}$. That is, there must exist a scalar function $\\lambda(x)$ such that:\n$$ A_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad u_{ij} - u_i u_j = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} $$\nThis is the necessary and sufficient condition on $u$. When this condition holds, contracting with $\\delta^{ij}$ gives $\\text{tr}(A) = n\\lambda$. Also, $\\text{tr}(A) = \\delta^{ij}(u_{ij}-u_iu_j) = \\Delta u - |\\nabla u|^2$. Thus, $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n}(\\Delta u - |\\nabla u|^2)$.\n\nSubstituting $A_{ij} = \\lambda\\delta_{ij}$ back into the tensor equation:\nThe left side becomes $(\\lambda\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk} - \\lambda\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\lambda\\delta_{jk}\\delta_{il} - \\lambda\\delta_{jl}\\delta_{ik}) - |\\nabla u|^2(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}-\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$.\nThis simplifies to $-2\\lambda(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}-\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) - |\\nabla u|^2(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}-\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) = (-2\\lambda - |\\nabla u|^2)(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}-\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$.\nSo, $(-2\\lambda - |\\nabla u|^2)(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}-\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) = 2Ke^{2u}(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$.\nAs the tensor $(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}-\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$ is not identically zero for $n \\ge 3$, the scalar factors must be equal:\n$$ -2\\lambda - |\\nabla u|^2 = 2Ke^{2u} $$\nSolving for $K$:\n$$ K = e^{-2u}(-\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla u|^2) $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$ K = e^{-2u}\\left(-\\frac{1}{n}(\\Delta u - |\\nabla u|^2) - \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla u|^2\\right) $$\n$$ K = e^{-2u}\\left(-\\frac{1}{n}\\Delta u + \\frac{1}{n}|\\nabla u|^2 - \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla u|^2\\right) $$\n$$ K = e^{-2u}\\left(-\\frac{1}{n}\\Delta u - \\frac{n-2}{2n}|\\nabla u|^2\\right) $$\n$$ K = -e^{-2u}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\Delta u + \\frac{n-2}{2n}|\\nabla u|^2\\right) $$\nFor $n \\ge 3$, if the condition $u_{ij} - u_i u_j = \\lambda \\delta_{ij}$ holds, a known theorem guarantees that the sectional curvature is constant.
