This can be expressed for any vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ as:\n    $$X(g(Y,Z)) = g(\\nabla_X Y, Z) + g(Y, \\nabla_X Z)$$\n2.  **Torsion-free**: The torsion tensor vanishes, $T(X,Y) = 0$. This is equivalent to the condition:\n    $$\\nabla_X Y - \\nabla_Y X = [X,Y]$$\n    where $[X,Y]$ is the Lie bracket of the vector fields $X$ and $Y$.\n\nThese two properties are sufficient to derive the Koszul formula, which provides an explicit expression for the connection in terms of the metric and its derivatives. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$, the formula is:\n$$2g(\\nabla_X Y, Z) = X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y],Z) + g([Z,X],Y) + g([Y,Z],X)$$\nThe problem asks us to evaluate this expression for the coordinate basis vector fields $X=\\partial_{i}$, $Y=\\partial_{j}$, and $Z=\\partial_{k}$, where $\\partial_{i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the terms in the Koszul formula with our chosen vector fields:\n- The left-hand side becomes $2g(\\nabla_{\\partial_{i}}\\partial_{j}, \\partial_{k})$.

In the coordinate basis, this property is expressed as $g_{ij} = g(\\partial_i, \\partial_j) = g(\\partial_j, \\partial_i) = g_{ji}$. Since the components are equal as functions on the manifold, their partial derivatives are also equal: $\\partial_{k}g_{ji} = \\partial_{k}g_{ij}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression yields:\n$$\\Gamma_{ijk} - \\Gamma_{jik} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\partial_{k}g_{ij} - \\partial_{k}g_{ij} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$$\nThe result demonstrates that the Christoffel symbols of the first kind, $\\Gamma_{ijk}$, are symmetric in their first two indices.
