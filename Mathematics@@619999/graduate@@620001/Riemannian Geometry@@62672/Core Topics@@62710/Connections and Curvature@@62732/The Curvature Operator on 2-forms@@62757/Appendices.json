The Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of the product manifold $(M,g)$ is related to the curvature tensors $R_1$ of $(M_1,g_1)$ and $R_2$ of $(M_2,g_2)$. For vectors decomposed as $X=X_1+X_2$ and $Y=Y_1+Y_2$, the Levi-Civita connection of the product is $\\nabla_X Y = \\nabla^1_{X_1}Y_1 + \\nabla^2_{X_2}Y_2$. This implies that the Riemann tensor of the product separates. Specifically, for vectors $u,v,w,x$ from the subspaces $V_1$ and $V_2$, the only non-vanishing components of $R$ are those acting purely within one of the subspaces. For $u_1, v_1, w_1 \\in V_1$ and $u_2, v_2, w_2 \\in V_2$, we have:\n$$\nR(u_1,v_1)w_1 = R_1(u_1,v_1)w_1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R(u_2,v_2)w_2 = R_2(u_2,v_2)w_2\n$$\nAll mixed-term applications of $R$ are zero, e.g., $R(u_1,v_1)w_2 = 0$ and $R(u_1,v_2)w = 0$.\n\nThe curvature operator $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined by $\\langle \\mathcal{R}(u \\wedge v), x \\wedge y \\rangle = \\langle R(u,v)y, x \\rangle$. We now determine its action on each of the three subspaces of $\\Lambda^2 V$.\n\n1.  **Action on $\\Lambda^2 V_1$:**\n    Let $\\omega = u_1 \\wedge v_1 \\in \\Lambda^2 V_1$. The vector $R(u_1,v_1)y$ is non-zero only if $y$ has a component in $V_1$. Specifically, $R(u_1,v_1)(y_1+y_2) = R_1(u_1,v_1)y_1 \\in V_1$. For the inner product $\\langle R(u_1,v_1)y, x \\rangle$ to be non-zero, $x$ must also have a component in $V_1$. This structure implies that if $\\omega \\in \\Lambda^2 V_1$, then $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)$ must lie entirely within $\\Lambda^2 V_1$. Thus, $\\Lambda^2 V_1$ is an invariant subspace for $\\mathcal{R}$.\n    Within this subspace, for any $\\sigma = x_1 \\wedge y_1 \\in \\Lambda^2 V_1$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\langle \\mathcal{R}(\\omega), \\sigma \\rangle = \\langle R(u_1,v_1)y_1, x_1 \\rangle = \\langle R_1(u_1,v_1)y_1, x_1 \\rangle\n    $$\n    Since $(M_1,g_1)$ has constant sectional curvature $\\kappa_1$, its curvature tensor is given by $R_1(u_1,v_1)y_1 = \\kappa_1(\\langle v_1,y_1 \\rangle_1 u_1 - \\langle u_1,y_1 \\rangle_1 v_1)$. The inner product becomes:\n    $$\n    \\langle \\mathcal{R}(\\omega), \\sigma \\rangle = \\kappa_1 (\\langle v_1,y_1 \\rangle_1 \\langle u_1,x_1 \\rangle_1 - \\langle u_1,y_1 \\rangle_1 \\langle v_1,x_1 \\rangle_1) = \\kappa_1 \\langle u_1 \\wedge v_1, x_1 \\wedge y_1 \\rangle = \\kappa_1 \\langle \\omega, \\sigma \\rangle\n    $$\n    Since this holds for all $\\sigma \\in \\Lambda^2 V_1$, it follows that $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = \\kappa_1 \\omega$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{R}$ acts as scalar multiplication by $\\kappa_1$ on $\\Lambda^2 V_1$. The eigenvalue is $\\kappa_1$, and the dimension of this eigenspace is $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 V_1) = \\binom{n_1}{2}$.\n\n2.  **Action on $\\Lambda^2 V_2$:**\n    The argument is identical to the one for $\\Lambda^2 V_1$, with all indices and curvatures replaced by those for $M_2$. The subspace $\\Lambda^2 V_2$ is invariant, and $\\mathcal{R}$ acts as scalar multiplication by $\\kappa_2$. The eigenvalue is $\\kappa_2$, and the dimension of this eigenspace is $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 V_2) = \\binom{n_2}{2}$.\n\n3.  **Action on $V_1 \\wedge V_2$:**\n    Let $\\omega = u_1 \\wedge u_2 \\in V_1 \\wedge V_2$, with $u_1 \\in V_1$ and $u_2 \\in V_2$. To find $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)$, we compute its inner product with an arbitrary $2$-form $x \\wedge y$:\n    $$\n    \\langle \\mathcal{R}(u_1 \\wedge u_2), x \\wedge y \\rangle = \\langle R(u_1, u_2)y, x \\rangle\n    $$\n    As established, the Riemann tensor of a product manifold is zero when acting on vectors from different factor manifolds, so $R(u_1, u_2)y = 0$ for any vector $y$. Thus, the inner product is always zero.\n    $$\n    \\langle \\mathcal{R}(u_1 \\wedge u_2), x \\wedge y \\rangle = 0\n    $$\n    This implies that $\\mathcal{R}(u_1 \\wedge u_2) = 0$. Since this holds for any generator of $V_1 \\wedge V_2$, the operator $\\mathcal{R}$ is the zero operator on this entire subspace. The eigenvalue is $0$, and the dimension of this eigenspace is $\\dim(V_1 \\wedge V_2) = n_1 n_2$.\n\nNow we assemble the eigen-decomposition of $\\mathcal{R}$ on $\\Lambda^2 V$:\n- Eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = \\kappa_1$ with multiplicity (dimension of eigenspace) $d_1 = \\binom{n_1}{2} = \\frac{n_1(n_1-1)}{2}$.\n- Eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = \\kappa_2$ with multiplicity $d_2 = \\binom{n_2}{2} = \\frac{n_2(n_2-1)}{2}$.\n- Eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$ with multiplicity $d_0 = n_1 n_2$.\n\nThe trace of the exponential of an operator is the sum of the exponentials of its eigenvalues, weighted by their multiplicities.\n$$\nZ(t) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\exp(t\\mathcal{R})) = \\sum_{\\lambda} (\\dim E_\\lambda) \\exp(t\\lambda)\n$$\nSubstituting the eigenvalues and multiplicities we found:\n$$\nZ(t) = d_1 \\exp(t \\lambda_1) + d_2 \\exp(t \\lambda_2) + d_0 \\exp(t \\lambda_0)\n$$\n$$\nZ(t) = \\frac{n_1(n_1-1)}{2} \\exp(t\\kappa_1) + \\frac{n_2(n_2-1)}{2} \\exp(t\\kappa_2) + n_1 n_2 \\exp(t \\cdot 0)\n$$\nSimplifying the last term, we arrive at the final expression for $Z(t)$:\n$$\nZ(t) = \\frac{n_1(n_1-1)}{2} \\exp(t\\kappa_1) + \\frac{n_2(n_2-1)}{2} \\exp(t\\kappa_2) + n_1 n_2\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n_1(n_1-1)}{2}\\exp(t\\kappa_1) + \\frac{n_2(n_2-1)}{2}\\exp(t\\kappa_2) + n_1n_2}\n$$", "id": "2994153"}, {"introduction": "The Riemann curvature tensor contains a wealth of geometric information, which can be systematically decomposed into irreducible parts with distinct meanings.
