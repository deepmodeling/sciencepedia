It presents a standard, solvable problem in Riemannian geometry.\n\nThe task is to compute the sectional curvature for a specific two-dimensional plane in two different manifolds, $(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}, g_{\\text{prod}})$ and $(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}, g_{\\text{warp}})$, and to interpret the results in the context of geodesic deviation. The sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ of a $2$-plane $\\sigma$ spanned by an orthonormal basis $\\{X, Y\\}$ is given by $K(\\sigma) = \\langle R(X,Y)Y, X \\rangle$.

The problem further specifies the formula $K(\\sigma) = \\langle R(e_y, e_r)e_r, e_y\\rangle$, which is equivalent by the symmetries of the Riemann tensor. We will work from the foundational definition $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$.\n\nFirst, we must compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, for each metric, as they are required to compute the covariant derivatives $\\nabla_X Y$.\n\n**Part 1: The Product Metric $g_{\\text{prod}}=dr^{2}+c^{2}\\,dy^{2}$**\n\nFor this metric, the components of the metric tensor in coordinates $(r, y)$ are $g_{rr}=1$, $g_{yy}=c^2$, and $g_{ry}=g_{yr}=0$. Since $c$ is a constant, all metric components are constant functions on the manifold.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are defined by $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}(\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$.\nSince all components $g_{ij}$ are constant, their partial derivatives $\\partial_i g_{jl}$ are all zero. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k \\in \\{r, y\\}$.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$.\nThe covariant derivative of a vector field $Y = Y^k \\partial_k$ along $X=X^i\\partial_i$ is $\\nabla_X Y = (X^i \\partial_i Y^k + X^i Y^j \\Gamma^k_{ij})\\partial_k$.\nSince all $\\Gamma^k_{ij}=0$, the covariant derivative reduces to the directional derivative of the components: $\\nabla_X Y = (X(Y^k))\\partial_k$.\n\nThe plane $\\sigma$ is spanned by the vector fields $E_r=\\partial_r$ and $E_y=\\frac{1}{c}\\partial_y$ (where $\\phi(r_0)=c$ is constant). These are constant-component vector fields in the $(r,y)$ chart.\nThe Lie bracket is $[E_r, E_y] = [\\partial_r, \\frac{1}{c}\\partial_y] = \\frac{1}{c}[\\partial_r, \\partial_y] = 0$.\nLet's compute the terms for $R(E_y, E_r)E_r$:\n$\\nabla_{E_r} E_r = \\nabla_{\\partial_r}\\partial_r = 0$ since its components are constant and the Christoffel symbols are zero.\n$\\nabla_{E_y} E_r = \\nabla_{\\frac{1}{c}\\partial_y}\\partial_r = 0$ for the same reason.\nTherefore, $\\nabla_{E_y}\\nabla_{E_r}E_r = \\nabla_{E_y}(0) = 0$ and $\\nabla_{E_r}\\nabla_{E_y}E_r = \\nabla_{E_r}(0) = 0$.\nThe Riemann tensor acting on these fields is $R(E_y, E_r)E_r = 0-0-0 = 0$.\n\nThe sectional curvature is $K_{\\text{prod}}(\\sigma) = \\langle R(e_y, e_r)e_r, e_y \\rangle = \\langle 0, e_y \\rangle = 0$.\nThis result is expected, as the metric $g_{\\text{prod}}$ describes a flat Euclidean plane, which has zero curvature everywhere.\n\n**Part 2: The Warped Product Metric $g_{\\text{warp}}=dr^{2}+f(r)^{2}\\,dy^{2}$**\n\nHere, $f(r)=\\exp(\\lambda r)$ with $\\lambda > 0$. The metric components are $g_{rr}=1$, $g_{yy}=f(r)^2$, and $g_{ry}=0$. The inverse metric has components $g^{rr}=1$ and $g^{yy}=f(r)^{-2}$.\nThe only non-constant component is $g_{yy}$, and its only non-zero derivative is with respect to $r$: $\\partial_r g_{yy} = 2f(r)f'(r)$.\nLet's calculate the non-zero Christoffel symbols, where $f' = \\frac{df}{dr}$:\n$\\Gamma^r_{yy} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{rr}(\\partial_y g_{ry} + \\partial_y g_{ry} - \\partial_r g_{yy}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(0+0 - 2ff') = -f(r)f'(r)$.\n$\\Gamma^y_{ry} = \\Gamma^y_{yr} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{yy}(\\partial_r g_{yy} + \\partial_y g_{ry} - \\partial_y g_{rr}) = \\frac{1}{2f^2}(2ff' + 0 - 0) = \\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}$.\nAll other Christoffel symbols are zero.\n\nThe plane $\\sigma$ is spanned by the vector fields $E_r=\\partial_r$ and $E_y=\\frac{1}{f(r_0)}\\partial_y$.

So $E_y=C\\partial_y$.\nThe Lie bracket is $[E_r, E_y] = [\\partial_r, C\\partial_y] = C[\\partial_r, \\partial_y] = 0$.\nThe Riemann tensor is $R(E_y, E_r)E_r = \\nabla_{E_y}\\nabla_{E_r}E_r - \\nabla_{E_r}\\nabla_{E_y}E_r$.\n\nWe compute the covariant derivatives:\n$\\nabla_{E_r}E_r = \\nabla_{\\partial_r}\\partial_r = \\Gamma^k_{rr}\\partial_k = 0$.\n$\\nabla_{E_y}E_r = \\nabla_{C\\partial_y}\\partial_r = C \\nabla_{\\partial_y}\\partial_r = C(\\Gamma^k_{yr}\\partial_k) = C(\\Gamma^r_{yr}\\partial_r + \\Gamma^y_{yr}\\partial_y) = C\\frac{f'}{f}\\partial_y$.\nSo, $\\nabla_{E_y}\\nabla_{E_r}E_r = \\nabla_{E_y}(0) = 0$.\n\nNow for the second term, we compute $\\nabla_{E_r}(\\nabla_{E_y}E_r)$:\n$\\nabla_{E_r}(\\nabla_{E_y}E_r) = \\nabla_{\\partial_r}(C\\frac{f'}{f}\\partial_y)$. This is the covariant derivative of the vector field $V(r) = C\\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}\\partial_y$.\nUsing the product rule for covariant differentiation:\n$\\nabla_{\\partial_r}(V^y(r)\\partial_y) = (\\partial_r V^y)\\partial_y + V^y(\\nabla_{\\partial_r}\\partial_y)$.\nHere $V^y(r) = C \\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}$.\n$\\partial_r V^y = C \\frac{d}{dr}(\\frac{f'}{f}) = C[\\frac{f''f - (f')^2}{f^2}] = C[\\frac{f''}{f} - (\\frac{f'}{f})^2]$.\nAnd $\\nabla_{\\partial_r}\\partial_y = \\Gamma^k_{ry}\\partial_k = \\Gamma^y_{ry}\\partial_y = \\frac{f'}{f}\\partial_y$.\nCombining these:\n$\\nabla_{E_r}\\nabla_{E_y}E_r = C[\\frac{f''}{f} - (\\frac{f'}{f})^2]\\partial_y + C\\frac{f'}{f}(\\frac{f'}{f}\\partial_y) = C\\frac{f''}{f}\\partial_y$.\n\nThe Riemann tensor is $R(E_y, E_r)E_r = 0 - C\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}\\partial_y = -C\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}\\partial_y$.\n\nWe now compute the sectional curvature at $(r_0, y_0)$.\n$e_r = \\partial_r$ and $e_y = C\\partial_y = \\frac{1}{f(r_0)}\\partial_y$.\n$R(e_y, e_r)e_r = -C\\frac{f''(r_0)}{f(r_0)}\\partial_y$.\n$K_{\\text{warp}}(\\sigma) = \\langle R(e_y, e_r)e_r, e_y \\rangle = g(-C\\frac{f''(r_0)}{f(r_0)}\\partial_y, C\\partial_y)$ at $(r_0,y_0)$.\n$K_{\\text{warp}}(\\sigma) = -C^2 \\frac{f''(r_0)}{f(r_0)} g(\\partial_y, \\partial_y)|_{(r_0,y_0)} = -(\\frac{1}{f(r_0)})^2 \\frac{f''(r_0)}{f(r_0)} (f(r_0)^2) = -\\frac{f''(r_0)}{f(r_0)}$.\n\nFor $f(r)=\\exp(\\lambda r)$, we have $f'(r)=\\lambda\\exp(\\lambda r)$ and $f''(r)=\\lambda^2\\exp(\\lambda r)$.\nThus, $\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} = \\lambda^2$. This ratio is constant.\nThe sectional curvature is $K_{\\text{warp}}(\\sigma) = -\\lambda^2$.\n\n**Geodesic Deviation Interpretation**\n\nGeodesic deviation is described by the Jacobi equation, which governs the separation vector $J(s)$ between nearby geodesics. For a geodesic with unit tangent vector $T$, the equation simplifies for the component $h(s)$ of $J(s)$ perpendicular to $T$:\n$$h''(s) + K h(s) = 0$$\nwhere $K$ is the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by $T$ and the separation direction, and $s$ is the arc length along the geodesic. The problem specifies geodesics initially tangent to $e_r=\\partial_r$ and a separation field along $e_y$. The vector field $T=\\partial_r$ is tangent to a geodesic, and the curvature of the plane $\\sigma=\\mathrm{span}\\{e_r, e_y\\}$ is $K$.\n\nFor the **product metric**, $K_{\\text{prod}}=0$. The Jacobi equation is $h''(s)=0$. The solution is $h(s)=h(0)+h'(0)s$. This indicates that the distance between nearby geodesics grows linearly. This is the characteristic behavior in a flat (zero curvature) space like the Euclidean plane.\n\nFor the **warped product metric**, $K_{\\text{warp}}=-\\lambda^2$, which is a negative constant since $\\lambda>0$. The Jacobi equation is $h''(s) - \\lambda^2 h(s)=0$. The general solution is a linear combination of $\\exp(\\lambda s)$ and $\\exp(-\\lambda s)$, or equivalently, $\\sinh(\\lambda s)$ and $\\cosh(\\lambda s)$. For geodesics starting at the same point ($h(0)=0$) with a small initial separation velocity ($h'(0) \\neq 0$), the solution is $h(s) = \\frac{h'(0)}{\\lambda}\\sinh(\\lambda s)$. For large $s$, this grows as $\\exp(\\lambda s)$. The negative sign of the curvature causes geodesics to diverge exponentially. The magnitude of the curvature, $|K| = \\lambda^2$, determines the rate of this exponential divergence. A larger $\\lambda$ implies a more strongly curved space and a more rapid separation of geodesics. This is the archetypal behavior in hyperbolic (negatively curved) geometry.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of computed sectional curvatures.\n$K_{\\text{prod}} = 0$\n$K_{\\text{warp}} = -\\lambda^2$\nThe pair is $(0, -\\lambda^2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -\\lambda^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2977628"}, {"introduction": "Curvature can be understood from two viewpoints: the curvature of an ambient manifold and the intrinsic curvature of a submanifold living within it.

The determinant of the shape operator is the product of the principal curvatures, $\\det(L_p) = k_1 k_2$. The second fundamental form is nonzero if and only if the shape operator is nonzero, which is true if at least one principal curvature is nonzero. The problem asks for examples where $K^S(p) \\neq K^M_p(\\sigma)$, which requires $\\det(L_p) = k_1 k_2 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe primary geometric consequences of the intrinsic curvature $K^S(p)$ are:\n1.  **Sum of angles in a geodesic triangle**: For a small geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ on $S$ enclosing a point $p$, the sum of its interior angles $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$ is given by the approximation:\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\alpha_i \\approx \\pi + K^S(p) \\cdot \\text{Area}(\\Delta)$$\n    Thus, the sum is greater than, equal to, or less than $\\pi$ according as $K^S(p)$ is positive, zero, or negative.\n2.  **Circumference of a geodesic circle**: The circumference $L(s)$ of a small geodesic circle of radius $s$ centered at $p$ has the expansion:\n    $$L(s) = 2\\pi s \\left(1 - \\frac{K^S(p)}{6}s^2 + O(s^4)\\right)$$\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $M = \\mathbb{H}^{3}$ with constant sectional curvature $-1$, and $S$ a horosphere.**\n\nA horosphere $S$ in hyperbolic $3$-space $\\mathbb{H}^3$ is intrinsically isometric to the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is a standard result; for instance, in the upper half-space model $\\{(x,y,z) | z > 0\\}$, the planes $z = \\text{const}$ are horospheres, and the induced metric $ds^2 = (dx^2+dy^2)/z^2$ is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric, and by a change of coordinates becomes exactly the Euclidean metric.\n-   Intrinsic curvature: $K^S(p) = 0$ for all $p \\in S$.\n-   Ambient curvature: $M = \\mathbb{H}^3$ has constant sectional curvature $K^M = -1$, so $K^M_p(\\sigma) = -1$.\n-   The curvatures differ: $K^S(p) = 0 \\neq -1 = K^M_p(\\sigma)$.\n-   Gauss equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 \\implies 0 = -1 + k_1 k_2 \\implies k_1 k_2 = 1$. A horosphere is totally umbilic, meaning $k_1 = k_2$. Therefore, $k_1^2=1$. By choosing the appropriate normal direction, we have $k_1 = k_2 = 1$. The second fundamental form is nonzero. The example fits the problem's criteria.\n-   Geometric consequence: Since $K^S(p) = 0$, for any geodesic triangle on $S$, the sum of interior angles is exactly $\\pi$. This contrasts with geodesic triangles in the ambient space $\\mathbb{H}^3$ (or on a totally geodesic surface within it), which have $K=-1$ and thus an angle sum less than $\\pi$.

This implies its shape operator is zero, so $k_1=k_2=0$.\n-   The problem asks for examples \"because the second fundamental form is nonzero.\" This example explicitly violates this condition.\n-   Let's check the claims for completeness. Using the Gauss Equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 = -1 + 0 = -1$. The statement claims $K^M_p(\\sigma) = -1$ and $K^S(p) = -1$, which is correct.\n-   Geometric consequence: The statement claims that for small geodesic triangles on $S$, the sum of interior angles equals $\\pi$. This is incorrect. Since $K^S(p) = -1$, the sum of interior angles is strictly less than $\\pi$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The example does not satisfy the premise of a nonzero second fundamental form, and the stated geometric consequence is false.\n\n**C. $M = S^{3}$ with constant sectional curvature $1$, and $S$ a geodesic sphere of (intrinsic) radius $r \\in (0,\\pi/2)$.**\n\nA geodesic sphere $S$ of radius $r$ in a space of constant curvature $C=1$ is a standard example.\n-   Ambient curvature: $K^M_p(\\sigma) = 1$.\n-   A geodesic sphere is totally umbilic. The principal curvatures are equal and given by $k_1 = k_2 = \\cot r$. Since $r \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $\\cot r \\neq 0$, so the second fundamental form is nonzero.\n-   Gauss equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 = 1 + (\\cot r)(\\cot r) = 1 + \\cot^2 r = \\csc^2 r$.\n-   Since $r \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, we have $0 < \\sin r < 1$, so $\\csc^2 r = 1/\\sin^2 r > 1$. The curvatures differ: $K^S(p) > 1 = K^M_p(\\sigma)$. The example fits the problem's criteria.\n-   Geometric consequence: The circumference of a small geodesic circle of radius $s$ is given by the expansion $L(s) = 2\\pi s (1 - \\frac{K^S(p)}{6}s^2 + o(s^2))$. Substituting $K^S(p) = \\csc^2 r$, we get $L(s) = 2\\pi s (1 - \\frac{\\csc^2 r}{6}s^2 + o(s^2))$, which matches the formula given.\n-   Comparison: A totally geodesic $S^2 \\subset S^3$ (a great sphere) has intrinsic curvature $K=1$. Its geodesic circle circumference would be $L_{geo}(s) = 2\\pi s (1 - \\frac{1}{6}s^2 + o(s^2))$. Since $\\csc^2 r > 1$, the negative correction term for $S$ is larger in magnitude than for the totally geodesic sphere ($-\\frac{\\csc^2 r}{6} < -\\frac{1}{6}$). Thus, $L(s)$ is strictly smaller for small $s$. The stated consequence is accurate.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. $M = \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with zero sectional curvature, and $S$ a standard torus of revolution.**\n\nFor $M = \\mathbb{R}^3$, the ambient sectional curvature is always zero: $K^M_p(\\sigma) = 0$.\n-   Gauss equation becomes $K^S(p) = k_1 k_2$. This is Gauss's *Theorema Egregium*. The problem asks for $K^S \\neq K^M$, which means we need $k_1 k_2 \\neq 0$.\n-   At a saddle point on the inner equator of a torus of revolution (with major radius $R$ and minor radius $r$), the two principal curvatures have opposite signs. One corresponds to the meridian circle (radius $r$) and the other to the latitudinal circle (radius $R-r$). With the standard outward normal, the principal curvatures are $k_1 = -1/r < 0$ and $k_2 = 1/(R-r) > 0$. The statement gives $k_1 > 0$ and $k_2 < 0$, which is just a change in labeling but correctly identifies that they have opposite signs. Thus, the product $K^S(p) = k_1 k_2 < 0$. Since $K^M_p(\\sigma) = 0$, the curvatures differ and the second fundamental form is nonzero. The example fits the criteria.\n-   Geometric consequence: Since $K^S(p) < 0$, for sufficiently small geodesic triangles near $p$, the sum of interior angles will be less than $\\pi$. The statement is accurate.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. $M = S^{3}$ with constant sectional curvature $1$, and $S$ a totally geodesic great $2$-sphere.**\n\n-   As in option B, this is an example where the second fundamental form is zero by definition ($k_1=k_2=0$), so it does not meet the problem's central requirement. A totally geodesic surface is shaped as \"flatly\" as possible within the ambient manifold.\n-   Gauss equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 = 1 + 0 = 1$.

However, the example itself is explicitly excluded by the problem's premise \"identify examples in which the ambient sectional curvature ... differs from the intrinsic Gauss curvature ... because the second fundamental form is nonzero\".\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.

Structure Constants for the Orthonormal Basis**\n\nThe metric is defined such that the basis $\\{x, y, z\\}$ is orthonormal at the identity, where\n$x = \\sqrt{2}\\,E$\n$y = \\sqrt{2}\\,F$\n$z = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,H$\nWe can express $E, F, H$ in terms of $x, y, z$:\n$E = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x$\n$F = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}y$\n$H = 2z$\n\nThe Lie brackets for the basis $\\{x, y, z\\}$ are calculated from the given brackets for $\\{E, F, H\\}$:\n$[x, y] = [\\sqrt{2}\\,E, \\sqrt{2}\\,F] = 2[E, F] = 2H = 2(2z) = 4z$\n$[y, z] = [\\sqrt{2}\\,F, \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,H] = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}[F, H] = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}[H, F] = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(-2F) = \\sqrt{2}F = y$\n$[z, x] = [\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,H, \\sqrt{2}\\,E] = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}[H, E] = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(2E) = \\sqrt{2}E = x$\n\nSo, for our orthonormal basis $\\{x, y, z\\}$, the Lie algebra structure is:\n$[x, y] = 4z$\n$[y, z] = y$\n$[z, x] = x$\n\n**2. Levi-Civita Connection**\n\nFor a left-invariant metric on a Lie group, the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ at the identity is given by the Koszul formula. For vector fields $U, V, W$ in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n$$2\\langle \\nabla_U V, W \\rangle = \\langle [U,V], W \\rangle - \\langle [V,W], U \\rangle + \\langle [W,U], V \\rangle$$\nSince $\\{x,y,z\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, we can use this formula to find the connection components $\\nabla_U V$. An equivalent and systematic way is to use the formula:\n$$\\nabla_U V = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [U,V] - \\mathrm{ad}_U^*(V) - \\mathrm{ad}_V^*(U) \\right)$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{ad}_U^*(V)$ is the adjoint of $\\mathrm{ad}_U(V)=[U,V]$ with respect to the metric $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$, i.e., $\\langle \\mathrm{ad}_U^*(V), W \\rangle = \\langle V, [U,W] \\rangle$.\n\nLet's compute the non-zero connection components $\\nabla_U V$ for $U,V \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$.\nWe use the fact that $\\nabla_U U = 0$ for any $U$ in an orthonormal basis defining a left-invariant metric. Also, the connection is torsion-free, so $\\nabla_U V - \\nabla_V U = [U,V]$.\n\n- **Compute $\\nabla_x y$**: We need $\\mathrm{ad}_x^*(y)$ and $\\mathrm{ad}_y^*(x)$.\n$\\langle \\mathrm{ad}_x^*(y), z \\rangle = \\langle y, [x,z] \\rangle = \\langle y, -[z,x] \\rangle = \\langle y, -x \\rangle = 0$. By checking against $x, y, z$, we find $\\mathrm{ad}_x^*(y)=0$. Similarly, $\\mathrm{ad}_y^*(x)=0$.\n$\\nabla_x y = \\frac{1}{2} ( [x,y] - 0 - 0 ) = \\frac{1}{2}(4z) = 2z$.\n$\\nabla_y x = \\nabla_x y - [x,y] = 2z - 4z = -2z$.\n\n- **Compute $\\nabla_x z$**: We need $\\mathrm{ad}_x^*(z)$ and $\\mathrm{ad}_z^*(x)$.\n$\\langle \\mathrm{ad}_x^*(z), y \\rangle = \\langle z, [x,y] \\rangle = \\langle z, 4z \\rangle = 4$. So $\\mathrm{ad}_x^*(z) = 4y$.\n$\\langle \\mathrm{ad}_z^*(x), x \\rangle = \\langle x, [z,x] \\rangle = \\langle x, x \\rangle = 1$. So $\\mathrm{ad}_z^*(x) = x$.\n$\\nabla_x z = \\frac{1}{2} ( [x,z] - \\mathrm{ad}_x^*(z) - \\mathrm{ad}_z^*(x) ) = \\frac{1}{2} ( -x - 4y - x ) = -x - 2y$.\n$\\nabla_z x = \\nabla_x z - [x,z] = (-x - 2y) - (-x) = -2y$.\n\n- **Compute $\\nabla_y z$**: We need $\\mathrm{ad}_y^*(z)$ and $\\mathrm{ad}_z^*(y)$.\n$\\langle \\mathrm{ad}_y^*(z), x \\rangle = \\langle z, [y,x] \\rangle = \\langle z, -4z \\rangle = -4$. So $\\mathrm{ad}_y^*(z) = -4x$.\n$\\langle \\mathrm{ad}_z^*(y), y \\rangle = \\langle y, [z,y] \\rangle = \\langle y, -y \\rangle = -1$. So $\\mathrm{ad}_z^*(y) = -y$.\n$\\nabla_y z = \\frac{1}{2} ( [y,z] - \\mathrm{ad}_y^*(z) - \\mathrm{ad}_z^*(y) ) = \\frac{1}{2} ( y - (-4x) - (-y) ) = \\frac{1}{2}(2y+4x) = 2x+y$.\n$\\nabla_z y = \\nabla_y z - [y,z] = (2x+y) - y = 2x$.\n\n**3. Riemann Curvature and Sectional Curvature**\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is defined as $R(U,V)W = \\nabla_U \\nabla_V W - \\nabla_V \\nabla_U W - \\nabla_{[U,V]} W$. The sectional curvature of the plane spanned by an orthonormal pair $\\{U,V\\}$ is $K(U \\wedge V) = \\langle R(U,V)V, U \\rangle$. For left-invariant vector fields forming an orthonormal basis at the identity, $\\nabla_V V = 0$. This simplifies the expression for $K(U \\wedge V)$:\n$$K(U \\wedge V) = \\langle \\nabla_U \\nabla_V V - \\nabla_V \\nabla_U V - \\nabla_{[U,V]} V, U \\rangle = \\langle - \\nabla_V(\\nabla_U V) - \\nabla_{[U,V]} V, U \\rangle$$\n\n- **Calculate $K(x \\wedge y)$**:\nLet $U=x, V=y$. We have $\\nabla_x y = 2z$ and $[x,y]=4z$.\n$K(x \\wedge y) = \\langle - \\nabla_y(2z) - \\nabla_{4z} y, x \\rangle = \\langle -2\\nabla_y z - 4\\nabla_z y, x \\rangle$.\nUsing our connection components: $\\nabla_y z = 2x+y$ and $\\nabla_z y = 2x$.\n$K(x \\wedge y) = \\langle -2(2x+y) - 4(2x), x \\rangle = \\langle -4x - 2y - 8x, x \\rangle = \\langle -12x - 2y, x \\rangle = -12\\langle x,x \\rangle - 2\\langle y,x \\rangle = -12$.\nSo, $K(x \\wedge y) = -12$.\n\n- **Calculate $K(x \\wedge z)$**:\nLet $U=x, V=z$. We have $\\nabla_x z = -x-2y$ and $[x,z]=-x$.\n$K(x \\wedge z) = \\langle - \\nabla_z(\\nabla_x z) - \\nabla_{[x,z]} z, x \\rangle = \\langle - \\nabla_z(-x-2y) - \\nabla_{-x} z, x \\rangle$.\n$K(x \\wedge z) = \\langle \\nabla_z x + 2\\nabla_z y + \\nabla_x z, x \\rangle$.\nUsing our components: $\\nabla_z x = -2y$, $\\nabla_z y = 2x$, and $\\nabla_x z = -x-2y$.\n$K(x \\wedge z) = \\langle (-2y) + 2(2x) + (-x-2y), x \\rangle = \\langle -2y + 4x - x - 2y, x \\rangle = \\langle 3x - 4y, x \\rangle = 3\\langle x,x \\rangle - 4\\langle y,x \\rangle = 3$.\nSo, $K(x \\wedge z) = 3$.\n\n- **Calculate $K(y \\wedge z)$**:\nLet $U=y, V=z$. We have $\\nabla_y z = 2x+y$ and $[y,z]=y$.\n$K(y \\wedge z) = \\langle - \\nabla_z(\\nabla_y z) - \\nabla_{[y,z]} z, y \\rangle = \\langle - \\nabla_z(2x+y) - \\nabla_y z, y \\rangle$.\n$K(y \\wedge z) = \\langle -2\\nabla_z x - \\nabla_z y - (2x+y), y \\rangle$.\nUsing our components: $\\nabla_z x = -2y$ and $\\nabla_z y = 2x$.\n$K(y \\wedge z) = \\langle -2(-2y) - (2x) - 2x - y, y \\rangle = \\langle 4y - 2x - 2x - y, y \\rangle = \\langle 3y - 4x, y \\rangle = 3\\langle y,y \\rangle - 4\\langle x,y \\rangle = 3$.\nSo, $K(y \\wedge z) = 3$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of Geodesic Behavior**\n\nThe sign of the sectional curvature determines the local behavior of geodesics. This is described by the Jacobi equation, which governs the deviation vector between nearby geodesics.\n- **Positive sectional curvature ($K > 0$)**: Geodesics initially parallel in that plane tend to converge, or \"focus\". Their distance grows slower than in Euclidean space ($t$).\n- **Negative sectional curvature ($K < 0$)**: Geodesics initially parallel in that plane tend to diverge, or \"defocus\". Their distance grows faster than in Euclidean space.\n- **Zero sectional curvature ($K = 0$)**: To second order, geodesics behave as in Euclidean space; they remain parallel.\n\nBased on our calculations:\n- $K(x \\wedge y) = -12 < 0$: Geodesics initially tangent to the $x \\wedge y$ plane will defocus.\n- $K(x \\wedge z) = 3 > 0$: Geodesics initially tangent to the $x \\wedge z$ plane will focus.\n- $K(y \\wedge z) = 3 > 0$: Geodesics initially tangent to the $y \\wedge z$ plane will focus.\n\nIn summary, $K(x \\wedge y) < 0$ and $K(x \\wedge z) = K(y \\wedge z) > 0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. $K(x \\wedge y) < 0$ while $K(x \\wedge z) = K(y \\wedge z) > 0$; geodesics initially tangent to $x \\wedge y$ defocus and those tangent to $x \\wedge z$ or $y \\wedge z$ focus compared to the Euclidean behavior.**\nThis statement perfectly matches our derived sectional curvatures ($K(x \\wedge y)=-12$, $K(x \\wedge z)=3$, $K(y \\wedge z)=3$) and their standard geometric interpretations. **Correct**.\n\n- **B. $K(x \\wedge y) > 0$ while $K(x \\wedge z) = K(y \\wedge z) < 0$; geodesics initially tangent to $x \\wedge y$ focus and those tangent to $x \\wedge z$ or $y \\wedge z$ defocus compared to the Euclidean behavior.**\nThis statement has the signs of the sectional curvatures incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. $K(x \\wedge y)$, $K(x \\wedge z)$, and $K(y \\wedge z)$ are all negative; geodesics initially tangent to any of these planes defocus compared to the Euclidean behavior.**\nThis is incorrect as we found $K(x \\wedge z)$ and $K(y \\wedge z)$ to be positive. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $K(x \\wedge y) = K(x \\wedge z) = 0$ and $K(y \\wedge z) > 0$; geodesics initially tangent to the zero-curvature planes remain parallel as in the Euclidean case, while those tangent to $y \\wedge z$ focus.**\nThis is incorrect as we found non-zero values for all three sectional curvatures. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. $K(x \\wedge y) < 0$ while $K(x \\wedge z) = K(y \\wedge z) = 0$; geodesics initially tangent to $x \\wedge z$ or $y \\wedge z$ neither focus nor defocus to first order, whereas those tangent to $x \\wedge y$ defocus.**\nThis is incorrect as we found $K(x \\wedge z)$ and $K(y \\wedge z)$ to be non-zero. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2977681"}]}
