Derivation of the differential Bianchi identity from the Jacobi identity.\n2.  Contraction of the Bianchi identity to relate the divergence of the Ricci tensor to the gradient of the Ricci scalar.\n3.  Calculation of the divergence of the Einstein tensor.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Differential Bianchi Identity\n\nThe Jacobi identity for three operators $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $[[A,B],C] + [[B,C],A] + [[C,A],B] = 0$. We apply this identity to the covariant derivative operators $A=\\nabla_c$, $B=\\nabla_d$, and $C=\\nabla_e$ acting on an arbitrary vector field $v^b$.\n\nLet's compute the first term, $[[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d], \\nabla_e] v^b$:\n$$\n[[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d], \\nabla_e] v^b = [\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d](\\nabla_e v^b) - \\nabla_e([\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d] v^b)\n$$\nUsing the commutator rules for tensors, we find:\n$$\n[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d](\\nabla_e v^b) = R^b_{~kcd}(\\nabla_e v^k) - R^k_{~ecd}(\\nabla_k v^b)\n$$\nAnd using the product rule for derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla_e([\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d] v^b) = \\nabla_e(R^b_{~kcd} v^k) = (\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd}) v^k + R^b_{~kcd}(\\nabla_e v^k)\n$$\nCombining these gives:\n$$\n[[\\nabla_c, \\nabla_d], \\nabla_e] v^b = -(\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd}) v^k - R^k_{~ecd}(\\nabla_k v^b)\n$$\nSumming this expression over cyclic permutations of the indices $(c,d,e)$ must yield zero:\n$$\n-\\left( (\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd} + \\nabla_c R^b_{~kde} + \\nabla_d R^b_{~kec}) v^k \\right) - \\left( (R^k_{~ecd} + R^k_{~cde} + R^k_{~dec}) (\\nabla_k v^b) \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe second term in parentheses vanishes due to the first (algebraic) Bianchi identity for a torsion-free connection. Therefore, the first term must also vanish. Since this must hold for any arbitrary vector field $v^k$, its coefficient must be zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_e R^b_{~kcd} + \\nabla_c R^b_{~kde} + \\nabla_d R^b_{~kec} = 0\n$$\nThis is the differential Bianchi identity (also known as the second Bianchi identity).\n\n#### Part 2: Contraction of the Bianchi Identity\n\nWe now perform two contractions on the differential Bianchi identity to find a relation between the divergence of the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar gradient. A convenient form of the identity is:\n$$\n\\nabla_k R^i_{~jlm} + \\nabla_l R^i_{~jmk} + \\nabla_m R^i_{~jkl} = 0\n$$\nFirst, contract by setting $i=l$ and summing:\n$$\n\\nabla_k R^l_{~jlm} + \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk} + \\nabla_m R^l_{~jkl} = 0\n$$\nUsing the definition of the Ricci tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} \\equiv R^c_{~acb}$, and the antisymmetry of the Riemann tensor in its last two indices ($R^\\dots_{~kl} = -R^\\dots_{~lk}$), we identify terms:\n- $R^l_{~jlm} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}$\n- $R^l_{~jkl} = -R^l_{~jlk} = -\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}$\nThis gives the once-contracted identity:\n$$\n\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm} - \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} + \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk} = 0\n$$\nNow, contract with the inverse metric $g^{jk}$:\n$$\ng^{jk}(\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}) - g^{jk}(\\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}) + g^{jk}(\\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk}) = 0\n$$\nUsing metric compatibility ($\\nabla g = 0$), we can move the metric inside derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla_k (g^{jk}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}) - \\nabla_m (g^{jk}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}) + \\nabla_l (g^{jk}R^l_{~jmk}) = 0\n$$\n- First term: $\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}^k_{~m}$.\n- Second term: $\\nabla_m R$, where $R = g^{jk}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}$ is the scalar curvature.\n- Third term: $\\nabla_l (g^{jk}R_{ljmk}) = \\nabla_l (-g^{jk}R_{jlkm}) = \\nabla_l(-\\operatorname{Ric}^k_{~m})$.\nThe identity becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}^k_{~m} - \\nabla_m R - \\nabla_l \\operatorname{Ric}^l_{~m} = 0\n$$\nSince the Ricci tensor is symmetric for a Levi-Civita connection, $\\operatorname{Ric}^k_{~m} = \\operatorname{Ric}_m^{~k}$. Renaming dummy indices $k \\to j$ and $l \\to j$ gives:\n$$\n\\nabla_j \\operatorname{Ric}^j_{~m} - \\nabla_m R - \\nabla_j \\operatorname{Ric}^j_{~m} = 0\n$$\nThis is incorrect. The error is in identifying the third term. Let's re-evaluate $g^{jk}R^l_{~jmk}$.\n$g^{jk}R^l_{~jmk} = R^{lk}_{~~mk} = -R^{lk}_{~~km} = -R^l_m$. This is correct.\nLet's restart the second contraction from $\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm} - \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} + \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk} = 0$.\nContract with $g^{im}$: $\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}^i_{j} - \\nabla^i \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} + \\nabla_l (g^{im}R^l_{~jmk}) = 0$. This is not simplifying well.\n\nLet's use a cleaner method. Start with $\\nabla_k R_{lmab} + \\nabla_l R_{mkab} + \\nabla_m R_{klab} = 0$.\nContract with $g^{lb}$: $\\nabla_k R_{ma} - \\nabla_l R^l{}_{mka} + \\nabla_m R_{ka} = 0$.\nContract this with $g^{ma}$:\n$$g^{ma}(\\nabla_k R_{ma} - \\nabla_l R^l{}_{mka} + \\nabla_m R_{ka}) = 0$$\n$$\\nabla_k (g^{ma}R_{ma}) - \\nabla_l (g^{ma}R^l{}_{mka}) + \\nabla_m (g^{ma}R_{ka}) = 0$$\nThis gives:\n$$\\nabla_k R - \\nabla_l (R^{al}{}_{ka}) + \\nabla_m R^m{}_k = 0$$\nUsing antisymmetry $R^{al}{}_{ka} = -R^{al}{}_{ak} = -R^l_k$:\n$$\\nabla_k R - \\nabla_l(-R^l_k) + \\nabla_m R^m_k = 0$$\n$$\\nabla_k R + \\nabla_l R^l_k + \\nabla_m R^m_k = 0 \\quad \\text{(This is wrong again.)}$$\n\nLet's fix the original solution's logic.\nThe twice contracted identity is $\\nabla_k R - 2 \\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} = 0$. This is correct.\nThe derivation in the solution was:\n$\\nabla_k R - \\nabla_m (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{kj}) - \\nabla_l (g^{jm}R^l_{jmk}) = 0$. Sign error in my check.\nFrom once-contracted identity: $\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm} = \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} - \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk}$. Contract with $g^{jm}$:\n$\\nabla_k (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}) = \\nabla_m(g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}) - \\nabla_l(g^{jm}R^l_{~jmk})$\n$\\nabla_k R = \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}^m_k - \\nabla_l(-R^l_k) = \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}^m_k + \\nabla_l R^l_k = 2\\nabla_j \\operatorname{Ric}^j_k$.\nSo $\\nabla_j \\operatorname{Ric}^j_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_k R$. This is correct. Let's rewrite the solution to reflect this clear path.\n\n**Rewritten Part 2:**\nWe start from the once-contracted Bianchi identity: $\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm} - \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} + \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk} = 0$.\nRearranging this gives $\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm} = \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk} - \\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk}$. Now, contract with $g^{jm}$:\n$$g^{jm}\\nabla_k \\operatorname{Ric}_{jm} = g^{jm}(\\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}) - g^{jm}(\\nabla_l R^l_{~jmk})$$\nUsing metric compatibility, we can move the metric inside the derivatives:\n$$\\nabla_k (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}) = \\nabla_m (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}) - \\nabla_l (g^{jm}R^l_{~jmk})$$\nLet's evaluate each term:\n-   LHS: $\\nabla_k (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jm}) = \\nabla_k R$.\n-   First term on RHS: $\\nabla_m (g^{jm}\\operatorname{Ric}_{jk}) = \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}^m{}_k$.\n-   Second term on RHS: The tensor part is $g^{jm}R^l_{~jmk} = R^{l~m}{}_{~mk} = -R^{l~m}{}_{~km} = -R^l_k$. So the term is $-\\nabla_l(-R^l_k) = \\nabla_l R^l_k$.\nCombining these gives:\n$$\\nabla_k R = \\nabla_m \\operatorname{Ric}^m{}_k + \\nabla_l R^l_k$$\nRenaming dummy indices, we get $\\nabla_k R = 2\\nabla_j \\operatorname{Ric}^j{}_k$. This implies the contracted Bianchi identity:\n$$\\nabla_j \\operatorname{Ric}^j{}_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_k R$$\nRelabeling indices from $(j,k)$ to $(b,a)$, we have $\\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ba} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_a R$.\n\n#### Part 3: Divergence of the Einstein Tensor\nThe Einstein tensor is defined as $G_{ab} \\equiv \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R\\,g_{ab}$. We wish to compute its divergence, $\\nabla^b G_{ab}$. We use the contravariant index $b$ to indicate contraction with the metric, i.e., $\\nabla^b = g^{bc}\\nabla_c$.\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\left( \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R\\,g_{ab} \\right)\n$$\nApplying the covariant derivative and using the product rule:\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^b(R\\,g_{ab})\n$$\nThe divergence of the second term is $\\nabla^b(R g_{ab}) = g^{bc}\\nabla_c(R g_{ab}) = g^{bc}[(\\nabla_c R)g_{ab} + R(\\nabla_c g_{ab})]$. Due to metric compatibility, $\\nabla_c g_{ab} = 0$. The expression becomes $g^{bc}(\\nabla_c R)g_{ab} = \\delta^c_a \\nabla_c R = \\nabla_a R$.\nSo, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_a R\n$$\nSince the Ricci tensor is symmetric, $\\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} = \\nabla^b \\operatorname{Ric}_{ba}$. Substituting the result from Part 2:\n$$\n\\nabla^b G_{ab} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_a R\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_a R = 0\n$$\nThe divergence of the Einstein tensor is zero. The derivation confirms that no sign ambiguities arise when the specified conventions are used consistently.\n\nThe final closed-form expression for $\\nabla^b G_{ab}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2993785"}, {"introduction": "After establishing a general theorem, a vital step is to test it in a well-understood, symmetric setting.

For a space of constant sectional curvature, there is a unique candidate tensor, up to scaling. Let us propose the following form for the Riemann tensor:\n$$\nR(X,Y,Z,W) = C \\left( g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right),\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant to be determined. In index notation, this is $R_{abcd} = C(g_{ad}g_{bc} - g_{ac}g_{bd})$. We must verify that this tensor satisfies the required symmetries and yields the correct sectional curvature.\n\nLet's check the symmetries for the proposed tensor $T(X,Y,Z,W) = g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W)$:\n1. $T(Y,X,Z,W) = g(Y,W)g(X,Z) - g(Y,Z)g(X,W) = -T(X,Y,Z,W)$.

It is self-contained, consistent, and grounded in established mathematical theory. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n**a) Computation of the trace of the Einstein tensor**\n\nThe a) part of the problem asks for the computation of the trace of the Einstein tensor, $G^{a}{}_{a}$. The trace is defined as $G^{a}{}_{a} := g^{ab}G_{ab}$.\n\nWe start with the definition of the Einstein tensor:\n$$G_{ab} := R_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R\\,g_{ab}$$\nTo compute its trace, we contract it with the inverse metric $g^{ab}$:\n$$G^{a}{}_{a} = g^{ab}G_{ab} = g^{ab}\\left(R_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R\\,g_{ab}\\right)$$\nDistributing the $g^{ab}$ term, we get:\n$$G^{a}{}_{a} = g^{ab}R_{ab} - g^{ab}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}R\\,g_{ab}\\right)$$\nThe first term, $g^{ab}R_{ab}$, is the definition of the scalar curvature $R$. The second term can be simplified by treating the scalar curvature $R$ and the factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ as scalars that can be moved outside the contraction:\n$$G^{a}{}_{a} = R - \\frac{1}{2}R\\left(g^{ab}g_{ab}\\right)$$\nThe term $g^{ab}g_{ab}$ represents the contraction of the inverse metric with the metric, which yields the trace of the identity tensor. In index notation, $g^{ab}g_{ab} = \\delta^{a}{}_{a}$. In an $n$-dimensional space, the trace of the identity is simply the dimension $n$:\n$$\\delta^{a}{}_{a} = n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $G^{a}{}_{a}$:\n$$G^{a}{}_{a} = R - \\frac{1}{2}R\\,n = R\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)$$\nThis gives the trace of the Einstein tensor as a closed-form expression in terms of the dimension $n$ and the scalar curvature $R$.\n\n**b) Derivation of the divergence-free condition and analysis**\n\nFirst, we derive the divergence-free condition $\\nabla_a G^{ab} = 0$, starting from the second Bianchi identity. A convenient form of the second Bianchi identity is:\n$$\\nabla_k R^l{}_{mij} + \\nabla_m R^l{}_{ijk} + \\nabla_i R^l{}_{jkm} = 0$$\nWe contract this identity over the indices $l$ and $j$:\n$$\\nabla_k R^l{}_{mil} + \\nabla_m R^l{}_{ikl} + \\nabla_i R^l{}_{lkm} = 0$$\nUsing the definition of the Ricci tensor $R_{ab} = R^c{}_{acb}$, we can identify the contracted terms:\n-   $R^l{}_{mil} = R_{mi}$\n-   $R^l{}_{ikl} = R_{ik}$\n-   $R^l{}_{lkm} = R_{km}$\nSubstituting these into the contracted identity gives:\n$$\\nabla_k R_{mi} + \\nabla_m (-R_{ik}) + \\nabla_i R_{km} = 0$$\nHere we used the antisymmetry property $R^l{}_{ikl} = -R^l{}_{kil}$, and $R^l{}_{kil} = R_{ki}$. Due to the symmetry of the Ricci tensor for a Levi-Civita connection ($R_{ki} = R_{ik}$), this leads to $\\nabla_k R_{mi} - \\nabla_m R_{ik} + \\nabla_i R_{km} = 0$.\n\nNow, we contract this equation with the inverse metric $g^{ik}$:\n$$g^{ik}(\\nabla_k R_{mi} - \\nabla_m R_{ik} + \\nabla_i R_{km}) = 0$$\nUsing metric compatibility, $\\nabla_j g^{ik} = 0$, we can move the metric inside the derivatives:\n$$\\nabla_k (g^{ik}R_{mi}) - \\nabla_m (g^{ik}R_{ik}) + \\nabla_i (g^{ik}R_{km}) = 0$$\nLet's analyze each term. Let $R^a{}_{b} = g^{ac}R_{cb}$.\n-   $\\nabla_k (g^{ik}R_{mi}) = \\nabla_k R^k{}_{m}$\n-   $\\nabla_m (g^{ik}R_{ik}) = \\nabla_m R$ (since $g^{ik}R_{ik}$ is the scalar curvature $R$)\n-   $\\nabla_i (g^{ik}R_{km}) = \\nabla_i R^i{}_{m}$\nThe identity becomes:\n$$\\nabla_k R^k{}_{m} - \\nabla_m R + \\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} = 0$$\nRenaming the dummy summation index $k$ to $i$ in the first term, we get:\n$$\\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} - \\nabla_m R + \\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} = 0$$\n$$2\\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} - \\nabla_m R = 0$$\nThis leads to the contracted Bianchi identity:\n$$\\nabla_i R^i{}_{m} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_m R$$\nOr, raising the free index $m$ and renaming indices, $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$.\n\nNow we compute the divergence of the Einstein tensor $G^{ab} = R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R g^{ab}$:\n$$\\nabla_a G^{ab} = \\nabla_a \\left(R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R g^{ab}\\right) = \\nabla_a R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_a(R g^{ab})$$\nUsing the product rule and metric compatibility ($\\nabla_a g^{ab} = 0$):\n$$\\nabla_a G^{ab} = \\nabla_a R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}g^{ab}\\nabla_a R = \\nabla_a R^{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$$\nSubstituting the contracted Bianchi identity $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$:\n$$\\nabla_a G^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R = 0$$\nThus, the Einstein tensor is divergence-free, $\\nabla_a G^{ab} = 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the equation $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a)$ and its implications for $\\nabla_b R$. From part (a), we have the identity $G^a{}_a = R(1 - \\frac{n}{2})$. Taking the covariant derivative (which is just the gradient for a scalar field):\n$$\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = \\nabla_b\\left[R\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\right] = \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\nabla_b R$$\nThis identity holds for any Riemannian manifold. The divergence-free condition $\\nabla_a G^{ab} = 0$ is a separate consequence of the Bianchi identity. We now analyze the interplay in the specified cases.\n\n**General dimension $n$**:\nThe relation is $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = (1 - \\frac{n}{2})\\nabla_b R$. If $n \\neq 2$, this means that the gradient of the scalar curvature $\\nabla_b R$ is zero if and only if the gradient of the trace of the Einstein tensor $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a)$ is zero. The divergence-free condition $\\nabla_a G^{ab}=0$ does not, in general, impose any constraint on the trace $G^a{}_a$ or its gradient. Therefore, for a general manifold, $\\nabla_b R$ is not constrained to be zero.\n\n**Special case $n=2$**:\nIn two dimensions, the relation becomes:\n$$\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{2}\\right)\\nabla_b R = 0 \\cdot \\nabla_b R = 0$$\nThis is an identity $0=0$, because for $n=2$, the Einstein tensor is identically zero, $G_{ab} \\equiv 0$. This can be shown by noting that in $2$D, $R_{ab} = K g_{ab}$ where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, and $R=g^{ab}R_{ab}=2K$. Thus, $G_{ab} = R_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R g_{ab} = K g_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}(2K)g_{ab} = 0$. Consequently, its trace $G^a{}_a$ is also zero, and so is its gradient. The relation $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a)=(1-n/2)\\nabla_b R$ becomes trivial and provides no information whatsoever on $\\nabla_b R$. The scalar curvature $R$ (and Gaussian curvature $K$) can be a non-constant function on a 2D surface.\n\n**Einstein metrics $R_{ab}=\\lambda\\,g_{ab}$**:\nAn Einstein manifold is defined by $R_{ab} = \\lambda g_{ab}$ where $\\lambda$ is a constant.\nThe scalar curvature is $R = g^{ab}R_{ab} = g^{ab}(\\lambda g_{ab}) = \\lambda(g^{ab}g_{ab}) = \\lambda n$. Since both $\\lambda$ and $n$ are constants, $R$ is constant, which implies $\\nabla_b R = 0$.\nThe trace relation $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = (1 - \\frac{n}{2})\\nabla_b R$ becomes $\\nabla_b(G^a{}_a) = 0$, which is consistent since $G^a{}_a = n\\lambda(1-n/2)$ is also a constant.\nThe crucial insight here comes from the contracted Bianchi identity, not the trace relation. If we assume $R_{ab} = \\lambda(x) g_{ab}$ where $\\lambda$ could be a function, the contracted Bianchi identity $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R$ imposes a strong constraint.\n-   $\\nabla_a R^{ab} = \\nabla_a(\\lambda g^{ab}) = g^{ab}\\nabla_a \\lambda = \\nabla^b \\lambda$.\n-   $\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b R = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^b (n\\lambda) = \\frac{n}{2}\\nabla^b \\lambda$.\nThe condition becomes $\\nabla^b \\lambda = \\frac{n}{2}\\nabla^b \\lambda$, which simplifies to $(1 - \\frac{n}{2})\\nabla^b \\lambda = 0$.\nIf $n>2$, this forces $\\nabla^b \\lambda = 0$, meaning $\\lambda$ must be constant (this is Schur's Lemma for $n>2$). Thus, for $n>2$, any manifold satisfying $R_{ab} = \\lambda g_{ab}$ is an Einstein manifold with constant $\\lambda$, which in turn forces $\\nabla_b R = 0$. The constancy of $R$ is a consequence of the Bianchi identity.\nIf $n=2$, the equation becomes $0=0$, placing no restriction on $\\lambda(x)$, consistent with our finding for the general $n=2$ case.\n\nIn summary, the divergence-free condition $\\nabla_a G^{ab}=0$ and the constancy of scalar curvature on Einstein manifolds (for $n>2$) are both consequences of the second Bianchi identity. The trace relation from part (a) is an algebraic identity that is consistent with these facts but does not, by itself, generate them.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{R\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2993781"}]}
