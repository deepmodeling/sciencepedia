A chart on a topological manifold $M$ is a pair $(U,\\varphi)$ with $U \\subset M$ open and $\\varphi:U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ a homeomorphism onto its image. An atlas is a collection of charts whose domains cover $M$ and whose transition maps are smooth. A smooth atlas determines a smooth structure on $M$. For product manifolds $M \\times N$, one obtains an atlas from the product of atlases on $M$ and $N$, with transition maps given by the product of the corresponding transition maps on the factors. We will use stereographic projection to construct an atlas on $S^{1}$.\n\nStep 1: Constructing charts on $S^{1}$ via stereographic projection.\nLet a point on the circle be $p=(x_c, y_c)$ where $x_c^2 + y_c^2=1$. The north pole is $N=(0,1)$ and the south pole is $S=(0,-1)$.\nThe stereographic projection from $N$ is a map $\\varphi_N: S^1 \\setminus \\{N\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. It maps a point $p=(x_c, y_c)$ to the x-intercept of the line passing through $N$ and $p$. This coordinate, let's call it $t$, is given by $t = x_c / (1-y_c)$. The inverse map $\\varphi_N^{-1}: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1 \\setminus \\{N\\}$ is given by:\n$$ \\varphi_N^{-1}(t) = \\left(\\frac{2t}{1+t^2}, \\frac{t^2-1}{1+t^2}\\right) $$\nSimilarly, the stereographic projection from $S$ is a map $\\varphi_S: S^1 \\setminus \\{S\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. It maps a point $p=(x_c, y_c)$ to the x-intercept of the line passing through $S$ and $p$. This coordinate, let's call it $u$, is given by $u = x_c / (1+y_c)$. The inverse map $\\varphi_S^{-1}: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1 \\setminus \\{S\\}$ is:\n$$ \\varphi_S^{-1}(u) = \\left(\\frac{2u}{1+u^2}, \\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}\\right) $$\nThe two charts on $S^{1}$ are $(S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\},\\varphi_{N})$ and $(S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\},\\varphi_{S})$.\n\nOn the overlap $S^{1}\\setminus\\{N,S\\}$, both coordinates are defined. To find the transition map $\\varphi_{S}\\circ \\varphi_{N}^{-1}$, we take a coordinate $t$, find its corresponding point $p=\\varphi_N^{-1}(t)$, and then find its coordinate $u=\\varphi_S(p)$.\n$$ u = \\varphi_S(\\varphi_N^{-1}(t)) = \\frac{x_c}{1+y_c} = \\frac{2t/(1+t^2)}{1 + (t^2-1)/(1+t^2)} = \\frac{2t/(1+t^2)}{(t^2+1+t^2-1)/(1+t^2)} = \\frac{2t}{2t^2} = \\frac{1}{t} $$\nThe transition map is $u=1/t$. This map is smooth on its domain $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, and its inverse $t=1/u$ is also smooth. Hence the two stereographic charts form a smooth atlas on $S^{1}$.\n\nStep 2: Product atlas on $T^{2}=S^{1}\\times S^{1}$. Form the product charts by taking products of the above charts on each factor. There are four such product charts:\n- $(U_{NN},\\Phi_{NN})$ with $U_{NN} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})$ and $\\Phi_{NN}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{N}(p),\\varphi_{N}(q)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n- $(U_{NS},\\Phi_{NS})$ with $U_{NS} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})$ and $\\Phi_{NS}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{N}(p),\\varphi_{S}(q))$.\n- $(U_{SN},\\Phi_{SN})$ with $U_{SN} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N\\})$ and $\\Phi_{SN}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{S}(p),\\varphi_{N}(q))$.\n- $(U_{SS},\\Phi_{SS})$ with $U_{SS} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{S\\})$ and $\\Phi_{SS}(p,q) = (\\varphi_{S}(p),\\varphi_{S}(q))$.\n\nOn pairwise overlaps, the transition maps are products of the one-dimensional transition maps on $S^{1}$. For example, on $U_{NN}\\cap U_{SS} = (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N,S\\})\\times (S^{1}\\setminus\\{N,S\\})$, the transition map\n$$ \\Phi_{SS}\\circ \\Phi_{NN}^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(x,y) \\mid x=0 \\text{ or } y=0\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(x,y) \\mid x=0 \\text{ or } y=0\\} $$\nis given by\n$$ (x,y) \\mapsto \\left(\\frac{1}{x}, \\frac{1}{y}\\right), $$\nsince each factor uses the $t \\mapsto 1/t$ transition of $S^{1}$. This is smooth wherever $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$. Similar reasoning applies to all other overlaps, proving that the product charts define a smooth atlas on $T^{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Jacobian determinant of the transition map at the specified point. We are asked to compute the determinant of the Jacobian of the map\n$$ F(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}, \\frac{1}{y}\\right) $$\nat the point $(x,y)=(2,-\\tfrac{1}{3})$, which lies in the overlap domain since $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$.\n\nCompute the Jacobian matrix $DF(x,y)$. The partial derivatives are\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{x^{2}}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right) = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{y^{2}}. $$\nHence\n$$ DF(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\dfrac{1}{x^{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\dfrac{1}{y^{2}}\n\\end{pmatrix}, $$\nand the determinant is\n$$ \\det DF(x,y) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x^{2}y^{2}}. $$\nEvaluating at $(x,y)=\\left(2,-\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)$ gives\n$$ x^{2} = 4, \\quad y^{2} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{9}, \\quad x^{2}y^{2} = \\frac{4}{9}, \\quad \\det DF\\left(2,-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\,\\frac{4}{9}\\,} = \\frac{9}{4}. $$\n\nTherefore, the requested determinant is the exact fraction $\\dfrac{9}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$$", "id": "2990244"}, {"introduction": "Beyond explicit constructions, manifolds often arise implicitly as the solution sets to smooth equations.

From this definition, it is clear that the unit sphere $S^{n}$ is precisely the level set of $F$ corresponding to the value $1$, i.e., $S^{n} = F^{-1}(1)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the regular value characterization of smooth submanifolds. The Regular Value Theorem (also known as the Preimage Theorem) states that if $c$ is a regular value of a smooth map $f: M \\to N$ between smooth manifolds, then the preimage $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$. Furthermore, for any point $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$, the tangent space to the submanifold at $p$ is given by the kernel of the differential of $f$ at $p$:\n$$T_{p}(f^{-1}(c)) = \\ker(df_{p})$$\n\nIn our context, the ambient manifold is $M = \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the target manifold is $N = \\mathbb{R}$, the function is $F(x) = \\langle x, x \\rangle$, and the level set corresponds to the value $c=1$. To apply the theorem, we must first verify that $1$ is a regular value of $F$.\n\nA value $c \\in N$ is a regular value of $f: M \\to N$ if for every point $p \\in f^{-1}(c)$, the differential $df_{p}: T_{p}M \\to T_{c}N$ is a surjective (onto) linear map.\n\nHere, we consider a point $p \\in S^n = F^{-1}(1)$. The differential of $F$ at $p$, denoted $dF_{p}$, is a linear map from $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to $T_{1}\\mathbb{R}$. We can canonically identify the tangent spaces $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $T_{1}\\mathbb{R}$ with $\\mathbb{R}$. The action of the differential $dF_{p}$ on a tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is given by the directional derivative of $F$ at $p$ in the direction of $v$:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} F(p + tv)$$\nSubstituting the definition of $F$:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\langle p + tv, p + tv \\rangle$$\nUsing the bilinearity of the inner product, we expand the expression:\n$$\\langle p + tv, p + tv \\rangle = \\langle p, p \\rangle + t\\langle p, v \\rangle + t\\langle v, p \\rangle + t^2\\langle v, v \\rangle$$\nSince the standard Euclidean inner product is symmetric, $\\langle p, v \\rangle = \\langle v, p \\rangle$. Thus:\n$$\\langle p + tv, p + tv \\rangle = \\langle p, p \\rangle + 2t\\langle p, v \\rangle + t^2\\langle v, v \\rangle$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $t$ and evaluate at $t=0$:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\langle p, p \\rangle + 2t\\langle p, v \\rangle + t^2\\langle v, v \\rangle) = 2\\langle p, v \\rangle + 2t\\langle v, v \\rangle \\bigg|_{t=0} = 2\\langle p, v \\rangle$$\nSo, the differential is the linear map $dF_{p}: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $v \\mapsto 2\\langle p, v \\rangle$.\n\nFor $1$ to be a regular value, this map must be surjective for every $p \\in S^{n}$. The codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$, a $1$-dimensional vector space. A linear map to a $1$-dimensional space is surjective if and only if it is not the zero map. The map $dF_{p}$ is the zero map if and only if $2\\langle p, v \\rangle = 0$ for all vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. This condition, $\\langle p, v \\rangle = 0$ for all $v$, implies that $p$ must be the zero vector, $p=0$.\n\nHowever, we are restricted to points $p \\in S^{n}$. By definition, any point $p \\in S^{n}$ satisfies $\\langle p, p \\rangle = \\|p\\|^2 = 1$. This implies that $p$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, for any $p \\in S^{n}$, the differential $dF_{p}$ is a non-zero linear functional and is, consequently, surjective.\n\nThis confirms that $1$ is a regular value of $F$. By the Regular Value Theorem, $S^{n}$ is a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The theorem also provides the characterization of the tangent space $T_{p}S^{n}$ as the kernel of the differential $dF_{p}$:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\ker(dF_{p})$$\nThe kernel of $dF_{p}$ is the set of all vectors $v \\in T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are mapped to zero by $dF_{p}$:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid dF_{p}(v) = 0\\}$$\nSubstituting our expression for the differential, we get:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid 2\\langle p, v \\rangle = 0\\}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$T_{p}S^{n} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid \\langle p, v \\rangle = 0\\}$$\nThis expression provides the canonical identification of the tangent space $T_{p}S^{n}$ as a subspace of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. It is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are orthogonal to the position vector $p$.
