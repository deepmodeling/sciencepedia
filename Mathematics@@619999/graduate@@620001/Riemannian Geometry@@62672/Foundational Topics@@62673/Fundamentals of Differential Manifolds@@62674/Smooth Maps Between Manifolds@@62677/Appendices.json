The subject is the map $f_{n}: S^{1} \\to S^{1}$ defined for an integer $n \\geq 2$ by $f_{n}(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{in\\theta}$, where $S^{1}$ is the unit circle in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nFirst, we prove that $f_{n}$ is a smooth covering map. A smooth map $\\pi: E \\to B$ between manifolds is a smooth covering map if for every point $p \\in B$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets $V_{j} \\subset E$, and the restriction of $\\pi$ to each $V_{j}$ is a diffeomorphism onto $U$. Let us take an arbitrary point $p \\in S^{1}$ in the target manifold. We can write $p = e^{i\\psi}$ for some $\\psi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. We must exhibit a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ that is evenly covered by $f_{n}$. Let us choose $U$ to be the open arc given by $U = S^{1} \\setminus \\{-p\\} = \\{e^{i\\phi} \\mid \\phi \\in (\\psi-\\pi, \\psi+\\pi) \\pmod{2\\pi}\\}$. The preimage of $U$ under $f_{n}$ is the set $f_{n}^{-1}(U) = \\{e^{i\\theta} \\in S^{1} \\mid f_{n}(e^{i\\theta}) \\in U\\}$. This condition is $e^{in\\theta} \\in U$, which means that the angle $n\\theta$ must lie in the interval $(\\psi-\\pi, \\psi+\\pi)$ up to multiples of $2\\pi$. That is, $n\\theta \\in (\\psi-\\pi+2\\pi k, \\psi+\\pi+2\\pi k)$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $\\theta \\in (\\frac{\\psi-\\pi+2\\pi k}{n}, \\frac{\\psi+\\pi+2\\pi k}{n})$. Let us define the open sets $V_{k} \\subset S^{1}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ as $V_{k} = \\{ e^{i\\theta} \\mid \\theta \\in (\\frac{\\psi-\\pi+2\\pi k}{n}, \\frac{\\psi+\\pi+2\\pi k}{n}) \\}$. These $n$ sets are open arcs in the source $S^{1}$. The angular width of each arc $V_{k}$ is $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$. Since $n \\geq 2$, these arcs are not the entire circle. The upper bound of the angle interval for $V_{k}$ is $\\frac{\\psi+\\pi+2\\pi k}{n}$, and the lower bound for $V_{k+1}$ is $\\frac{\\psi-\\pi+2\\pi(k+1)}{n} = \\frac{\\psi+\\pi+2\\pi k}{n}$. As the intervals are open, the sets $V_{k}$ are disjoint for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. Their union is precisely $f_{n}^{-1}(U)$. Now, consider the restriction $f_{n}|_{V_{k}}: V_{k} \\to U$. In angular coordinates, this map sends $\\theta$ from the interval defining $V_{k}$ to $n\\theta \\pmod{2\\pi}$. The map $\\theta \\mapsto n\\theta - 2\\pi k$ is a diffeomorphism from the interval $(\\frac{\\psi-\\pi+2\\pi k}{n}, \\frac{\\psi+\\pi+2\\pi k}{n})$ to $(\\psi-\\pi, \\psi+\\pi)$. Thus, $f_{n}|_{V_{k}}$ is a diffeomorphism from the arc $V_{k}$ to the arc $U$. Since this holds for any $p \\in S^{1}$, $f_{n}$ is a smooth covering map.\n\nSecond, we prove that $f_{n}$ is a local diffeomorphism. By the inverse function theorem for manifolds, a smooth map $F: M \\to N$ is a local diffeomorphism if and only if its differential $dF_{p}: T_{p}M \\to T_{F(p)}N$ is a linear isomorphism at every point $p \\in M$. For $f_{n}: S^{1} \\to S^{1}$, both the domain and codomain are $1$-dimensional manifolds. Let $\\theta$ be the angular coordinate on the source $S^{1}$ and $\\phi$ be the angular coordinate on the target $S^{1}$. In these local coordinates, the map $f_{n}$ is given by $\\phi(\\theta) = n\\theta$. The tangent space at any point of $S^{1}$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space. In the coordinate chart for the source, a basis for the tangent space $T_{e^{i\\theta}}S^{1}$ is given by the vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$. Similarly, a basis for $T_{e^{i\\phi}}S^{1}$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}$. The differential of $f_{n}$ at a point $p=e^{i\\theta}$ maps tangent vectors at $p$ to tangent vectors at $f_{n}(p)=e^{in\\theta}$. In local coordinates, its action on the basis vector is given by the chain rule: $d(f_{n})_{p}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi} = n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}$. The matrix representation of this linear map is the $1 \\times 1$ Jacobian matrix, which is $[n]$. The determinant of this matrix is $n$. Since the problem states $n \\geq 2$, we have $n \\neq 0$. This implies that the differential $d(f_{n})_{p}$ is an isomorphism for every $p \\in S^{1}$. Therefore, by the inverse function theorem, $f_{n}$ is a local diffeomorphism.\n\nThird, we prove that $f_{n}$ is not a global diffeomorphism for $n>1$. A global diffeomorphism is a smooth map that has a smooth inverse, which implies it must be a bijection (one-to-one and onto). We will show that $f_{n}$ is not injective for $n>1$. Let's test two distinct points in the domain $S^{1}$. Consider the point $x_{1} = e^{i0} = 1$ and the point $x_{2} = e^{i2\\pi/n}$. Since $n>1$, we have $0 < \\frac{2\\pi}{n} < 2\\pi$, so $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are distinct points on $S^{1}$. Now we compute their images under $f_{n}$:\n$f_{n}(x_{1}) = f_{n}(e^{i0}) = e^{in \\cdot 0} = e^{i0} = 1$.\n$f_{n}(x_{2}) = f_{n}(e^{i2\\pi/n}) = e^{in(2\\pi/n)} = e^{i2\\pi} = 1$.\nSince $f_{n}(x_{1}) = f_{n}(x_{2})$ but $x_{1} \\neq x_{2}$, the map $f_{n}$ is not injective. A map that is not injective cannot be a bijection, and therefore cannot be a global diffeomorphism. This holds for any integer $n>1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the integral $I(n) = \\int_{S^{1}} f_{n}^{*}\\eta$. The form $\\eta$ is the standard angular $1$-form on the target $S^{1}$, which is given by $d\\phi$ in the angular coordinate $\\phi$. To compute the integral, we first need to find the pullback of $\\eta$ by $f_{n}$, denoted $f_{n}^{*}\\eta$. The pullback is a $1$-form on the source $S^{1}$. Let $\\theta$ be the angular coordinate on the source $S^{1}$. The map $f_{n}$ relates the coordinates by $\\phi = n\\theta$. The pullback of a differential form is computed by substituting the coordinate expressions and their differentials.\n$f_{n}^{*}\\eta = f_{n}^{*}(d\\phi) = d(f_{n}^{*}\\phi)$.\nThe pullback of a function (a $0$-form) is simply composition, so $f_{n}^{*}\\phi = \\phi \\circ f_{n}$. In terms of our coordinates, this is simply the expression for $\\phi$ in terms of $\\theta$, which is $n\\theta$.\nSo, $f_{n}^{*}\\eta = d(n\\theta) = n \\,d\\theta$.\nThe integral is thus $I(n) = \\int_{S^{1}} n \\, d\\theta$.\nTo evaluate this integral over the manifold $S^{1}$, we use its standard parameterization by the angle $\\theta$ running from $0$ to $2\\pi$, which corresponds to traversing the circle once in the counter-clockwise direction (the standard orientation).\n$$ I(n) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} n \\, d\\theta = n \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = n [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = n(2\\pi - 0) = 2\\pi n $$\nThe result of the integral is a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$. This result is also consistent with the topological degree of the map $f_{n}$, which is $n$, since the degree is given by $\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{S^{1}} f_{n}^{*}\\eta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi n}$$", "id": "2990358"}, {"introduction": "While not all maps are local diffeomorphisms, their local behavior is far from arbitrary.

Computation of the Differential and its Rank**\n\nLet the smooth map $f:M\\to N$ be given by $f(x,y,z) = (x, y, xy)$. Since $M=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $N=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ are endowed with their standard global coordinates, the differential of $f$ at a point $(x,y,z) \\in M$, denoted $\\mathrm{d}f_{(x,y,z)}$, is represented by the Jacobian matrix $J_f(x,y,z)$. The components of $f$ are $f_1(x,y,z)=x$, $f_2(x,y,z)=y$, and $f_3(x,y,z)=xy$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ_f(x,y,z) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ y & x & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAt the point $p=(0,0,0) \\in M$, the differential $\\mathrm{d}f_{p}$ is represented by the matrix:\n$$\nJ_f(0,0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the image of the linear transformation it represents, which is equal to the number of linearly independent rows or columns. The matrix $J_f(0,0,0)$ has two non-zero rows which are linearly independent. Thus, the rank of $\\mathrm{d}f_{p}$ is $2$.\n\nTo prove that the rank is constant in a neighborhood of $p$, we examine the rank of $J_f(x,y,z)$ for an arbitrary point $(x,y,z) \\in M$. The rank of a matrix is the size of its largest non-singular square submatrix. Consider the top-left $2 \\times 2$ submatrix:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts determinant is $1 \\neq 0$. This implies that the rank of $J_f(x,y,z)$ is at least $2$ for all points $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The rank can be at most $3$, as it is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix. The rank is $3$ if and only if the determinant of the full matrix is non-zero. The determinant of $J_f(x,y,z)$ is:\n$$\n\\det(J_f(x,y,z)) = 1 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ x & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ y & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ y & x \\end{pmatrix} = 1(1 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot x) = 0\n$$\nSince the determinant is zero for all $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the rank of $J_f(x,y,z)$ is never $3$.\nTherefore, the rank of $\\mathrm{d}f_{(x,y,z)}$ is exactly $2$ for all points in $M=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. This confirms that the rank is constant, with value $k=2$, on the entire manifold $M$, and thus in any neighborhood of $p=(0,0,0)$.\n\n**2. Construction of Coordinate Charts $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$**\n\nThe Constant Rank Theorem states that for a map $f$ of constant rank $k$, there exist coordinate charts $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ around $p$ and $f(p)$ respectively, such that the map takes the canonical form of a projection. We are asked to find these charts explicitly.\n\nLet the coordinates on the domain $M$ be $(x,y,z)$ and on the codomain $N$ be $(v_1,v_2,v_3)$.\nThe map is $f(x,y,z) = (v_1,v_2,v_3) = (x,y,xy)$.\nThe target form for the map in the new coordinates $(u_1,u_2,u_3)$ is $\\Psi \\circ f \\circ \\Phi^{-1}(u_1,u_2,u_3) = (u_1, u_2, 0)$.\n\n**Construction of the Domain Chart $\\Phi$**\nWe need to define a coordinate chart $\\Phi: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ in a neighborhood $U$ of $p=(0,0,0)$. The coordinates provided by $\\Phi$ are $(u_1, u_2, u_3)$. A simple and valid choice is to use the existing global coordinates. Let us define:\n$$\n\\Phi(x,y,z) = (x,y,z)\n$$\nSo, $u_1=x$, $u_2=y$, and $u_3=z$. This map is $\\Phi = \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^3}$. To justify that this is a local diffeomorphism, we apply the Inverse Function Theorem. The Jacobian of $\\Phi$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix $I_3$:\n$$\nJ_\\Phi(x,y,z) = I_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(J_\\Phi) = 1$, which is non-zero everywhere. Thus, $\\Phi$ is a local diffeomorphism on all of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. It is in fact a global diffeomorphism. The neighborhood $U$ can be taken as the entire manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nThe inverse map is simply $\\Phi^{-1}(u_1,u_2,u_3) = (u_1,u_2,u_3)$.\n\n**Construction of the Codomain Chart $\\Psi$**\nWith our choice of $\\Phi$, the composition $f \\circ \\Phi^{-1}$ is:\n$$\n(f \\circ \\Phi^{-1})(u_1,u_2,u_3) = f(u_1,u_2,u_3) = (u_1, u_2, u_1 u_2)\n$$\nLet $(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ be the standard coordinates on $N$. The map above sends $(u_1,u_2,u_3)$ to $(v_1,v_2,v_3) = (u_1, u_2, u_1 u_2)$.\nWe seek a coordinate chart $\\Psi(v_1,v_2,v_3)=(w_1,w_2,w_3)$ in a neighborhood $V$ of $f(p)=f(0,0,0)=(0,0,0)$ such that:\n$$\n\\Psi \\circ (f \\circ \\Phi^{-1})(u_1,u_2,u_3) = (u_1,u_2,0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f \\circ \\Phi^{-1}$, we get:\n$$\n\\Psi(u_1, u_2, u_1 u_2) = (u_1, u_2, 0)\n$$\nThis equation guides our choice for $\\Psi$. Let $(w_1,w_2,w_3) = \\Psi(v_1,v_2,v_3)$. The condition $\\Psi(u_1, u_2, u_1 u_2) = (u_1, u_2, 0)$ suggests defining the first two components of the new coordinates as:\n$$\nw_1(v_1,v_2,v_3) = v_1\n$$\n$$\nw_2(v_1,v_2,v_3) = v_2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the condition, we have for the third component $w_3$:\n$$\nw_3(u_1, u_2, u_1 u_2) = 0\n$$\nSince $v_1=u_1$ and $v_2=u_2$ on the image of $f \\circ \\Phi^{-1}$, this is equivalent to $w_3(v_1, v_2, v_1 v_2) = 0$. A simple function satisfying this relationship is:\n$$\nw_3(v_1,v_2,v_3) = v_3 - v_1 v_2\n$$\nThus, we define the coordinate chart $\\Psi: N \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ as:\n$$\n\\Psi(v_1,v_2,v_3) = (v_1, v_2, v_3 - v_1 v_2)\n$$\nTo justify that $\\Psi$ is a local diffeomorphism, we compute its Jacobian matrix:\n$$\nJ_\\Psi(v_1,v_2,v_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial w_1}{\\partial v_1} & \\frac{\\partial w_1}{\\partial v_2} & \\frac{\\partial w_1}{\\partial v_3} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial w_2}{\\partial v_1} & \\frac{\\partial w_2}{\\partial v_2} & \\frac{\\partial w_2}{\\partial v_3} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial w_3}{\\partial v_1} & \\frac{\\partial w_3}{\\partial v_2} & \\frac{\\partial w_3}{\\partial v_3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -v_2 & -v_1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(J_\\Psi) = 1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot 1 - (-v_1) \\cdot 0) = 1$. Since the determinant is a non-zero constant, the Inverse Function Theorem guarantees that $\\Psi$ is a local diffeomorphism everywhere on $N$. So we may take $V=N=\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nWith these charts, $\\Phi(x,y,z)=(x,y,z)$ and $\\Psi(v_1,v_2,v_3)=(v_1,v_2,v_3-v_1v_2)$, the transformed map is indeed:\n$$\n(\\Psi \\circ f \\circ \\Phi^{-1})(u_1,u_2,u_3) = \\Psi(f(u_1,u_2,u_3)) = \\Psi(u_1, u_2, u_1 u_2) = (u_1, u_2, u_1 u_2 - u_1 u_2) = (u_1, u_2, 0)\n$$\nThis satisfies the requirement of the problem.\n\n**3.

A point $(u,v)$ is in $S$ if it satisfies $H(u,v) = \\sin u + 2 \\sin v = 0$.\nIf we substitute the implications of $dH_{(u,v)}=0$ into the equation for $S$, we get:\n$$ (\\pm 1) + 2(\\pm 1) = 0. $$\nThis equation can never be satisfied, as the possible values for the left-hand side are $1+2=3$, $1-2=-1$, $-1+2=1$, and $-1-2=-3$.\nSince the differential $dH_{(u,v)}$ is never the zero map for any point $(u,v)$ in the preimage $S=f^{-1}(A)$, we conclude that $0$ is a regular value of $H$. This proves that $f$ is transverse to $A$ at every point of $f^{-1}(A)$.\n\n**Part 2: The Preimage Submanifold and its Parametrization**\n\nBy the Transversality Theorem (or the Regular Value Theorem/Implicit Function Theorem), since $f$ is transverse to $A$, the preimage $S = f^{-1}(A)$ is an embedded submanifold of $T^2$. The codimension of $S$ in $T^2$ is equal to the codimension of $A$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is $1$. Since $\\dim(T^2)=2$, $S$ is a $1$-dimensional submanifold. As $S$ is a closed subset of the compact manifold $T^2$, $S$ is itself compact. A compact $1$-dimensional manifold is a finite disjoint union of closed curves (diffeomorphic to $S^1$).\n\nThe defining equation for $S$ is $\\sin u + 2\\sin v = 0$, or $\\sin u = -2\\sin v$.\nSince the range of $\\sin u$ is $[-1,1]$, solutions can only exist for values of $v$ such that $-1 \\le -2\\sin v \\le 1$, which is equivalent to $-\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\sin v \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThis restricts $v$ to the union of closed intervals on the real line: $v \\pmod{2\\pi} \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}] \\cup [\\frac{5\\pi}{6}, \\frac{7\\pi}{6}] \\cup [\\frac{11\\pi}{6}, 2\\pi]$.\n\nTo determine the number of connected components, we can partition $S$ based on the sign of the $x$-coordinate of the image, $f_1(u,v) = \\cos u + 2\\cos v$.\nLet $S_+ = \\{(u,v) \\in S \\mid \\cos u + 2\\cos v > 0\\}$ and $S_- = \\{(u,v) \\in S \\mid \\cos u + 2\\cos v < 0\\}$.\nThe case $\\cos u + 2\\cos v = 0$ together with $\\sin u + 2\\sin v=0$ would imply $\\cos u = -2\\cos v$ and $\\sin u = -2\\sin v$. Squaring and adding these equations gives $\\cos^2 u + \\sin^2 u = 4\\cos^2 v + 4\\sin^2 v$, which simplifies to $1=4$, a contradiction. Thus, $\\cos u + 2\\cos v$ is never zero on $S$, so $S = S_+ \\sqcup S_-$.\n\nConsider the map $T: T^2 \\to T^2$ defined by $T(u,v) = (u+\\pi, v+\\pi) \\pmod{2\\pi}$. This is a diffeomorphism of the torus. If $(u,v) \\in S$, then $\\sin u + 2\\sin v = 0$. The point $T(u,v)=(u',v')$ satisfies $\\sin u' = \\sin(u+\\pi) = -\\sin u$ and $\\sin v' = \\sin(v+\\pi) = -\\sin v$. So $\\sin u' + 2\\sin v' = -(\\sin u + 2\\sin v) = 0$, which means $T(S) = S$.\nThe $x$-coordinate transforms as $f_1(u', v') = \\cos(u+\\pi) + 2\\cos(v+\\pi) = -\\cos u - 2\\cos v = -f_1(u,v)$.\nThis shows that $T$ maps $S_+$ to $S_-$ and $S_-$ to $S_+$. Since $T$ is a homeomorphism, it maps connected components to connected components. Therefore, the number of connected components of $S_+$ is equal to the number of connected components of $S_-$. The total number of components of $S$ is twice the number of components of $S_+$.\n\nLet's analyze the domain of $v$ for points in $S$.\n- If $v \\in [\\frac{5\\pi}{6}, \\frac{7\\pi}{6}]$, then $\\cos v \\le \\cos(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The coordinate $x = \\cos u + 2\\cos v \\le 1 + 2(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 1-\\sqrt{3} < 0$. So all points in $S$ with $v$ in this interval belong to $S_-$.\n- If $v \\pmod{2\\pi} \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}] \\cup [\\frac{11\\pi}{6}, 2\\pi]$ (or $v \\in [-\\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{\\pi}{6}]$), then $\\cos v \\ge \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Also, $\\cos u = \\pm\\sqrt{1-4\\sin^2 v}$. The minimum value of $x=\\cos u + 2\\cos v$ occurs when $\\cos u$ is negative. Let's find the minimum of $x(v) = -\\sqrt{1-4\\sin^2 v} + 2\\cos v$ on $v \\in [0, \\pi/6]$. The derivative is $x'(v) = \\frac{4\\sin v \\cos v}{\\sqrt{1-4\\sin^2 v}} - 2\\sin v = 2\\sin v (\\frac{2\\cos v}{\\sqrt{1-4\\sin^2 v}} - 1)$. For $v \\in (0, \\pi/6)$, $\\sin v > 0$. The term in the parenthesis is positive because $4\\cos^2 v > 1-4\\sin^2 v \\implies 4 > 1$. So $x'(v)>0$. The function is increasing. Its minimum value is at $v=0$, where $x(0) = -1+2=1>0$. Thus, all points in $S$ with $v$ in this region belong to $S_+$.\n\nThe set $S_+$ consists of all solutions to $\\sin u = -2\\sin v$ where $v \\in [-\\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{\\pi}{6}]$ (mod $2\\pi$). This set forms a single closed curve on the torus. We can give an explicit global parametrization for this curve, $\\gamma_1: [0, 2\\pi) \\to T^2$, by\n$$ \\gamma_1(t) = \\left( t+\\pi, \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin t\\right) \\right). $$\nThis curve is simple and closed, so $S_+$ is connected and has one component.\n\nThe set $S_-$ consists of all solutions where $v \\in [\\frac{5\\pi}{6}, \\frac{7\\pi}{6}]$. This set also forms a single closed curve. Its global parametrization, $\\gamma_2: [0, 2\\pi) \\to T^2$, is given by\n$$ \\gamma_2(t) = \\left( t, \\pi + \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin t\\right) \\right). $$\nThis curve is also simple and closed, so $S_-$ is connected and has one component.\n\nTherefore, $S = S_+ \\cup S_-$ consists of two disjoint closed curves.\n\n**Part 3: Number of Connected Components**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the preimage $S=f^{-1}(A)$ is the disjoint union of two smooth embedded closed curves. The number of connected components of $S$ is therefore $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2990375"}]}
