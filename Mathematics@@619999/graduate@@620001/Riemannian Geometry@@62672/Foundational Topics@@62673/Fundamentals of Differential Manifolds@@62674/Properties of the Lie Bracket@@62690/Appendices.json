The definition is:\n$$ [X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)) $$\nwhere a vector field is identified with a derivation on the algebra of smooth functions.\n\nLet's apply this definition to the given vector fields $X = x\\,\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{y}$ and $Y = -y\\,\\partial_{x} + x\\,\\partial_{y}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the action of $Y$ on a generic smooth function $f(x,y)$:\n$$ Y(f) = (-y\\,\\partial_{x} + x\\,\\partial_{y})f = -y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} $$\nNext, we apply the vector field $X$ to the resulting smooth function $Y(f)$:\n$$ X(Y(f)) = (x\\,\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{y})\\left(-y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) $$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$ X(Y(f)) = x\\,\\partial_{x}\\left(-y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) + y\\,\\partial_{y}\\left(-y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) $$\n$$ X(Y(f)) = x\\left(-y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + x\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right) + y\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} -y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\\right) $$\n$$ X(Y(f)) = -xy\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + x^2\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} - y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} - y^2\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + xy\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} $$\n\nNow, we compute the term $Y(X(f))$. First, the action of $X$ on $f(x,y)$:\n$$ X(f) = (x\\,\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{y})f = x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} $$\nNext, we apply the vector field $Y$ to the resulting smooth function $X(f)$:\n$$ Y(X(f)) = (-y\\,\\partial_{x} + x\\,\\partial_{y})\\left(x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) $$\nUsing the product rule:\n$$ Y(X(f)) = -y\\,\\partial_{x}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) + x\\,\\partial_{y}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) $$\n$$ Y(X(f)) = -y\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right) + x\\left(x\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + y\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\\right) $$\n$$ Y(X(f)) = -y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} - xy\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} - y^2\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} + x^2\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + xy\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))$.

If $X = X^i \\partial_i$ and $Y = Y^j \\partial_j$, then $[X,Y] = (X(Y^k) - Y(X^k))\\partial_k$.\nHere, $(x^1, x^2) = (x, y)$.\nComponents of $X$: $X^x = x$, $X^y = y$.\nComponents of $Y$: $Y^x = -y$, $Y^y = x$.\n\nThe $x$-component of $[X,Y]$ is:\n$$ [X,Y]^x = X(Y^x) - Y(X^x) = (x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y)(-y) - (-y\\partial_x + x\\partial_y)(x) $$\n$$ = (x(0) + y(-1)) - (-y(1) + x(0)) = -y - (-y) = 0 $$\nThe $y$-component of $[X,Y]$ is:\n$$ [X,Y]^y = X(Y^y) - Y(X^y) = (x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y)(x) - (-y\\partial_x + x\\partial_y)(y) $$\n$$ = (x(1) + y(0)) - (-y(0) + x(1)) = x - x = 0 $$\nThus, $[X,Y] = 0\\cdot\\partial_x + 0\\cdot\\partial_y = 0$, confirming the previous result.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation:**\nThe vanishing of the Lie bracket, $[X,Y]=0$, has a profound geometric meaning: the flows generated by the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ commute. Let $\\phi_t^X$ be the flow of $X$ and $\\psi_s^Y$ be the flow of $Y$. The condition $[X,Y]=0$ is equivalent to $\\phi_t^X \\circ \\psi_s^Y = \\psi_s^Y \\circ \\phi_t^X$ for all $s,t$ for which the flows are defined.\n\nLet's identify the flows:\n1.  **Flow of $X = x\\,\\partial_x + y\\,\\partial_y$**: The flow lines are solutions to the differential equations $\\frac{dx}{dt} = x$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = y$. Given an initial point $(x_0, y_0)$, the solution is $(x(t), y(t)) = (x_0 e^t, y_0 e^t)$. The flow map is $\\phi_t^X(x_0, y_0) = e^t(x_0, y_0)$. This transformation is a uniform scaling or homothety centered at the origin. For $t>0$, it is a dilation, and for $t0$, it is a contraction. The vector field $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter group of homotheties. The pullback of the metric $g_0 = dx^2+dy^2$ is $(\\phi_t^X)^*g_0 = e^{2t}g_0$, so these are not isometries for $t \\neq 0$.\n\n2.  **Flow of $Y = -y\\,\\partial_x + x\\,\\partial_y$**: The flow lines are solutions to $\\frac{dx}{ds} = -y$ and $\\frac{dy}{ds} = x$. Given an initial point $(x_0,y_0)$, the solution is $(x(s), y(s)) = (x_0 \\cos(s) - y_0 \\sin(s), x_0 \\sin(s) + y_0 \\cos(s))$. In matrix form, this is:\n    $$ \\begin{pmatrix} x(s) \\\\ y(s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos s  -\\sin s \\\\ \\sin s  \\cos s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The flow map $\\psi_s^Y$ is a rotation about the origin by an angle $s$. Rotations preserve the Euclidean metric $g_0$, so they are isometries of $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g_0)$. The vector field $Y$ is a Killing vector field, generating the special orthogonal group $SO(2)$.\n\nThe result $[X,Y]=0$ means that the action of scaling commutes with the action of rotation. This is intuitively clear: scaling a point and then rotating it yields the same result as rotating it first and then scaling it. In linear algebra terms, a rotation matrix $R_s$ and a scaling matrix $S_t = e^t I$ (where $I$ is the identity matrix) commute:\n$$ S_t R_s = (e^t I) R_s = e^t (I R_s) = e^t R_s $$\n$$ R_s S_t = R_s (e^t I) = e^t (R_s I) = e^t R_s $$\nThus, $S_t R_s = R_s S_t$. This algebraic commutation of the flow maps is the geometric manifestation of the vanishing Lie bracket of their infinitesimal generators. The group of homotheties and the group of rotations on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (both centered at the origin) are commuting subgroups of the affine group.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2987419"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the idea that commuting vector fields can form a local coordinate system, this practice explores the opposite scenario when the Lie Bracket is non-vanishing.

This is a direct consequence of the Frobenius theorem. Therefore, our task is to construct an orthonormal frame $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ for which $[e_{1}, e_{2}] \\neq 0$.\n\nLet us begin by considering the standard Cartesian coordinate vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\}$. This is an orthonormal frame for the Euclidean metric $g=dx^{2}+dy^{2}$, and it is a coordinate frame, so $[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}] = 0$. To obtain a non-coordinate frame, we can apply a point-dependent rotation to this standard frame.

The unit vector field in the radial direction is $\\frac{x}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{y}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. Thus, we define:\n$$e_{1} = \\frac{x}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{y}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$$\nApplying a counter-clockwise rotation of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to the components $(\\frac{x}{r}, \\frac{y}{r})$ of $e_{1}$ gives the components $(-\\frac{y}{r}, \\frac{x}{r})$ for $e_{2}$. This ensures $e_2$ is orthogonal to $e_1$ and has unit length because rotation preserves length and orthogonality. Thus, we define:\n$$e_{2} = -\\frac{y}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{x}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$$\nThis frame is well-defined and smooth on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ since $r > 0$.

The second equation $1 = 0$ is a contradiction. Suppose $X$ is a smooth multiple of $Y$. Then $X = gY$ for some smooth $g$, so $\\partial_x = g\\partial_y$. This gives $1 = g \\cdot 0$, also a contradiction. Therefore, neither is a smooth multiple of the other.\n\nConclusion: Option A satisfies all conditions. **Correct**.\n\n**B. $X = \\partial_{x}$, $Y = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\,\\partial_{x}$, where $x$ is the first coordinate on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ descends to $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$.**\n1.  **Well-definedness:** $X=\\partial_x$ is well-defined. For $Y = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\,\\partial_{x}$, the component function $Y^1(x,y) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ is periodic with period $1$ in $x$ (since $\\sin(2\\pi(x+m)) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) and constant in $y$. Thus, it is $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and $Y$ is a well-defined vector field on $\\mathbb{T}^2$.\n2.  **Lie Bracket:** The Lie bracket is not zero. For colinear vector fields of the form $[X, fX]$, the bracket is $[X, fX] = (Xf)X$. Here, $X=\\partial_x$ and $f(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$, so $Xf = \\partial_x(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = 2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi x)$. Therefore, $[X, Y] = 2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi x)\\partial_x$, which is not the zero vector field.\n3.  **Non-colinearity:** This condition is not met. By definition, $Y = fX$ where $f(x,y) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ is a smooth function on $\\mathbb{T}^2$. Thus, $Y$ is a smooth multiple of $X$.\n\nConclusion: Option B fails on two counts. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $X = \\partial_{x} + \\sqrt{2}\\,\\partial_{y}$, $Y = \\partial_{x} + \\partial_{y}$.**\n1.  **Well-definedness:** Both $X$ and $Y$ are vector fields with constant coefficients on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. As in option A, their components are constant and therefore $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic. Both are well-defined on $\\mathbb{T}^2$.\n2.  **Lie Bracket:** The components of $X$ are $X^1=1$, $X^2=\\sqrt{2}$. The components of $Y$ are $Y^1=1$, $Y^2=1$. All components are constant.\n    $$[X,Y]^1 = X(Y^1) - Y(X^1) = (\\partial_x + \\sqrt{2}\\partial_y)(1) - (\\partial_x+\\partial_y)(1) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n    $$[X,Y]^2 = X(Y^2) - Y(X^2) = (\\partial_x + \\sqrt{2}\\partial_y)(1) - (\\partial_x+\\partial_y)(\\sqrt{2}) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n    Thus, $[X,Y]=0$. This is generally true for any two vector fields with constant coefficients.\n3.  **Non-colinearity:** Suppose $Y = fX$. Then $\\partial_x + \\partial_y = f(\\partial_x + \\sqrt{2}\\partial_y)$. Comparing components gives $1=f$ and $1=f\\sqrt{2}$. This implies $f=1$ and $f=1/\\sqrt{2}$, a contradiction. Suppose $X=gY$. Then $\\partial_x + \\sqrt{2}\\partial_y = g(\\partial_x + \\partial_y)$. Comparing components gives $1=g$ and $\\sqrt{2}=g$, a contradiction. The coefficient vectors $(1,\\sqrt{2})$ and $(1,1)$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConclusion: Option C satisfies all conditions. **Correct**.\n\n**D. $X = \\partial_{x}$, $Y = \\cos(2\\pi y)\\,\\partial_{y}$, where $y$ is the second coordinate on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\cos(2\\pi y)$ descends to $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$.**\n1.  **Well-definedness:** $X=\\partial_x$ is well-defined. For $Y = \\cos(2\\pi y)\\,\\partial_y$, the component function $Y^2(x,y) = \\cos(2\\pi y)$ is periodic with period $1$ in $y$ (since $\\cos(2\\pi(y+n)) = \\cos(2\\pi y)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) and constant in $x$. Thus, it is $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic, and $Y$ is well-defined.\n2.  **Lie Bracket:** We have $X = 1\\cdot\\partial_x + 0\\cdot\\partial_y$ and $Y = 0\\cdot\\partial_x + \\cos(2\\pi y)\\cdot\\partial_y$.\n    $$[X,Y]^1 = X(Y^1) - Y(X^1) = \\partial_x(0) - (\\cos(2\\pi y)\\partial_y)(1) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n    $$[X,Y]^2 = X(Y^2) - Y(X^2) = \\partial_x(\\cos(2\\pi y)) - (\\cos(2\\pi y)\\partial_y)(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n    The derivative of $\\cos(2\\pi y)$ with respect to $x$ is $0$. So, $[X,Y]=0$.\n3.  **Non-colinearity:** At a generic point, the vectors are linearly independent. For example, at $(x,y)=(0,0)$, $X_{(0,0)}=(1,0)$ and $Y_{(0,0)}=(0,1)$. Suppose $Y=fX$. Then $\\cos(2\\pi y)\\,\\partial_y = f \\partial_x$. This means $f=0$ and $\\cos(2\\pi y) = 0$. But $\\cos(2\\pi y)$ is not identically $0$ on $\\mathbb{T}^2$. Suppose $X=gY$. Then $\\partial_x = g \\cos(2\\pi y)\\,\\partial_y$. This implies $1=0$, a contradiction. Thus, neither is a smooth multiple of the other.\n\nConclusion: Option D satisfies all conditions. **Correct**.\n\n**E. $X = y\\,\\partial_{x}$, $Y = \\partial_{y}$, where $y$ is the second coordinate on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.**\n1.  **Well-definedness:** The vector field $X = y\\,\\partial_{x}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has component functions $X^1(x,y)=y$ and $X^2(x,y)=0$. To be well-defined on $\\mathbb{T}^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2/\\mathbb{Z}^2$, $X^1$ must be $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic. Let's check invariance under translation by $(m,n)=(0,1) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n    $$X^1(x, y+1) = y+1$$\n    This is not equal to $X^1(x,y)=y$. Therefore, the component function $y$ is not periodic with respect to integer shifts in the $y$-direction. $X$ does not descend to a well-defined vector field on $\\mathbb{T}^2$.\n\nConclusion: Option E fails the primary condition of providing a well-defined pair of vector fields on the torus. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2987407"}]}
