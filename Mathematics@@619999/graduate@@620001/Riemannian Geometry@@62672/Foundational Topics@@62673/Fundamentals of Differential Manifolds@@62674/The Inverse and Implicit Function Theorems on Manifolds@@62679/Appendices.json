It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with all necessary definitions provided or implied by the standard context of the field. We proceed with the solution.\n\nOur objective is to compute the differential of the exponential map $\\exp_{p} \\colon T_{p}M \\to M$ at the origin $0 \\in T_{p}M$. This differential is a linear map $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{0}(T_{p}M) \\to T_{\\exp_{p}(0)}M$.\n\nFirst, we identify the domain and codomain of this linear map. The domain is the tangent space to the manifold $T_{p}M$ at the point $0$. Since $T_{p}M$ is a vector space, there exists a canonical isomorphism between its tangent space at any point and the vector space itself. Thus, we have the identification $T_{0}(T_{p}M) \\simeq T_{p}M$.\n\nNext, we identify the point $\\exp_{p}(0)$ in the codomain manifold $M$. By definition, $\\exp_{p}(0) = \\gamma_{0}(1)$, where $\\gamma_{0}$ is the geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $0$. The curve $\\gamma_{0}(t) = p$ for all $t$ satisfies these conditions: $\\gamma_{0}(0) = p$ and its tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}(t)$ is the zero vector for all $t$. The geodesic equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}} \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} = \\nabla_{0} 0 = 0$ is trivially satisfied. Thus, the constant curve at $p$ is the required geodesic. It follows that $\\exp_{p}(0) = \\gamma_{0}(1) = p$. Consequently, the codomain of the differential is $T_{p}M$.\n\nUnder these identifications, the differential is a linear map $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$.\n\nTo compute this map, we use the definition of the differential applied to a vector $W \\in T_{p}M$. We choose a curve in the domain $T_{p}M$ that starts at $0$ and has initial velocity $W$. The simplest such curve is $\\alpha(s) = sW$ for $s \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. Here, $\\alpha(0) = 0$ and the tangent vector $\\alpha'(s)$ is identified with $W$ for all $s$ under the canonical identification $T_{sW}(T_p M) \\simeq T_p M$. Thus $\\alpha'(0)$ corresponds to $W$.\n\nThe differential $d(\\exp_{p})_{0}$ applied to $W$ is then the tangent vector at $s=0$ to the curve in $M$ given by the composition $\\exp_{p} \\circ \\alpha$:\n$$\nd(\\exp_{p})_{0}(W) = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} (\\exp_{p} \\circ \\alpha)(s) = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\exp_{p}(sW)\n$$\n\nTo evaluate this derivative, we employ the theory of geodesic variations and Jacobi fields, as suggested by the problem. Consider the two-parameter variation of geodesics $F \\colon (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times [0, 1] \\to M$ defined by\n$$\nF(s, t) = \\exp_{p}(t(sW)) = \\exp_{p}(tsW)\n$$\nFor a fixed $s$, the curve $t \\mapsto F(s,t)$ is the geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $sW$.\nThe vector we wish to compute is the variational vector field along the curve $t \\mapsto F(0,t)$ evaluated at $t=1$. This is $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s}(0, 1)$.\n\nThe vector field $J(t) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s}(0, t)$ is a Jacobi field along the base geodesic $\\gamma(t) = F(0, t)$. The base geodesic is $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_{p}(t \\cdot 0 \\cdot W) = \\exp_{p}(0) = p$. This is the constant geodesic at $p$, so its velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{t}^{2} J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{t}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. Since $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0$, the curvature term vanishes, and the Jacobi equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{t}^{2} J(t) = 0\n$$\nSince the base geodesic is a single point $p$, covariant differentiation along $\\gamma$ is just ordinary differentiation of vectors in the fixed tangent space $T_pM$. The equation becomes $\\frac{d^{2}J}{dt^{2}} = 0$, and its general solution is a linear function of $t$:\n$$\nJ(t) = A + tB\n$$\nwhere $A, B \\in T_pM$ are constant vectors determined by the initial conditions of the Jacobi field at $t=0$.\n\nThe initial conditions are $J(0)$ and its covariant derivative $\\nabla_{t}J(0)$.\nFirst, $J(0) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s}(0, 0)$. Since $F(s, 0) = \\exp_{p}(0 \\cdot sW) = \\exp_{p}(0) = p$ for all $s$, we have:\n$$\nJ(0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}\\bigg|_{s=0} p = 0 \\in T_{p}M\n$$\nNext, we compute $\\nabla_{t}J(0)$. Using the symmetry of the connection for coordinate vector fields (which we can extend to variational fields), we have $\\nabla_{t} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s} = \\nabla_{s} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}$. We evaluate this at $(s,t)=(0,0)$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{t}J(0) = \\nabla_{s}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}(s, t) \\right)\\bigg|_{t=0}\n$$\nThe vector field $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}(s,t)$ is the velocity vector of the geodesic $t \\mapsto F(s,t)$. At $t=0$, this is the initial velocity, which is $sW$. So, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}(s,0) = sW$.\nWe now need to compute the covariant derivative with respect to $s$ of the vector field $s \\mapsto sW$ at $s=0$. Since this is a curve of vectors within the single vector space $T_pM$, the covariant derivative is just the ordinary derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla_{s}\\bigg|_{s=0} (sW) = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} (sW) = W\n$$\nSo, the initial conditions for the Jacobi field are $J(0) = 0$ and $\\nabla_{t}J(0) = W$.\n\nSubstituting these into the general solution $J(t) = A + tB$:\n$J(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\nabla_{t}J(t) = B$, so $\\nabla_{t}J(0) = B = W$.\nTherefore, the Jacobi field is given by $J(t) = tW$.\n\nFinally, the vector we want to compute is $d(\\exp_{p})_{0}(W)$, which is given by the Jacobi field at $t=1$:\n$$\nd(\\exp_{p})_{0}(W) = J(1) = 1 \\cdot W = W\n$$\nSince this holds for any arbitrary vector $W \\in T_{p}M$, the map $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$ is the identity map, $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} = \\mathrm{Id}_{T_p M}$.\n\nThis result allows us to invoke the inverse function theorem on manifolds. The theorem states that if $f \\colon N_{1} \\to N_{2}$ is a smooth map between manifolds, and its differential $df_{q} \\colon T_{q}N_{1} \\to T_{f(q)}N_{2}$ is a linear isomorphism at a point $q \\in N_{1}$, then $f$ is a local diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of $q$ to a neighborhood of $f(q)$.\n\nIn our case, the map is $\\exp_{p} \\colon T_{p}M \\to M$ and the point is $0 \\in T_{p}M$. We have computed its differential at this point, $d(\\exp_{p})_{0} \\colon T_{p}M \\to T_{p}M$, to be the identity map $\\mathrm{Id}_{T_p M}$. The identity map on a vector space is trivially a linear isomorphism (it is its own inverse). Therefore, by the inverse function theorem, $\\exp_{p}$ is a local diffeomorphism from some neighborhood of $0$ in $T_{p}M$ to a neighborhood of $\\exp_{p}(0)=p$ in $M$.

We are given that the differential $d f_{p}:T_{p}M\\to T_{y}\\mathbb{R}^{k}$ is a surjective linear map.\n\nThe condition that $d f_{p}$ is surjective means that $p$ is a regular point of the map $f$.

The tangent space $T_{p}\\!\\left(f^{-1}(y)\\right)$ is precisely the tangent space $T_{p}S$ of this submanifold.\n\nTo characterize $T_{p}S$, we consider an arbitrary tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}S$.

The lift is given by $F(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}) = (2\\theta_{1}, 3\\theta_{2})$. The map $F$ is a linear transformation, and thus is smooth. Since $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism and $F$ is smooth, the map $f$ is smooth.\n\nTo check if $f$ is a local diffeomorphism, we use the inverse function theorem on manifolds. This theorem states that $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^{2}$ if its differential, $df_{p} : T_{p}\\mathbb{T}^{2} \\to T_{f(p)}\\mathbb{T}^{2}$, is a linear isomorphism. The tangent bundle of the torus is trivial, $T\\mathbb{T}^{2} \\cong \\mathbb{T}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so we can identify each tangent space $T_{p}\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ with $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

These points are distinct in $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ because their representatives $(0, 0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ do not differ by an element of the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$; specifically, $(\\frac{1}{2} - 0, 0 - 0) = (\\frac{1}{2}, 0) \\notin \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. Now we compute their images under $f$:\n$$\nf(p_{1}) = f([0, 0]) = [2 \\cdot 0, 3 \\cdot 0] = [0, 0].\n$$\n$$\nf(p_{2}) = f\\left(\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right]\\right) = \\left[2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}, 3 \\cdot 0\\right] = [1, 0].\n$$\nIn $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$, the point $[1, 0]$ is the same as $[0, 0]$ because their representatives $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ differ by an element of $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$: $(1 - 0, 0 - 0) = (1, 0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. Thus, $f([0, 0]) = f([\\frac{1}{2}, 0])$, but $[0, 0] \\neq [\\frac{1}{2}, 0]$. Therefore, the map $f$ is not globally injective.\n\nThird, we compute the topological degree, $\\deg(f)$. For a smooth map $g : M \\to N$ between compact, oriented, connected manifolds of the same dimension, the degree is defined with respect to a regular value $q \\in N$. A value $q$ is regular if for every $p \\in g^{-1}(q)$, the differential $dg_{p}$ is an isomorphism. The degree is then given by the formula:\n$$\n\\deg(g) = \\sum_{p \\in g^{-1}(q)} \\text{sgn}(\\det(dg_{p})).\n$$\nThe term $\\text{sgn}(\\det(dg_{p}))$ is $+1$ if $dg_{p}$ preserves orientation and $-1$ if it reverses orientation.\n\nIn our case, $f : \\mathbb{T}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{T}^{2}$. As shown in the first part, the differential $df_{p}$ is an isomorphism for all $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^{2}$. This implies that every point $q \\in \\mathbb{T}^{2}$ is a regular value of $f$. We can therefore choose any point $q \\in \\mathbb{T}^{2}$ to compute the degree. Let us choose the point $q = [0, 0]$.\nThe determinant of the differential $df_{p}$ (represented by the Jacobian matrix $DF$) is $6$, which is positive. The orientation on $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ is induced from the standard orientation of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Since the determinant is positive, the differential $df_{p}$ is orientation-preserving at every point $p$. Therefore, $\\text{sgn}(\\det(df_{p})) = +1$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^{2}$.\n\nThe degree formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\deg(f) = \\sum_{p \\in f^{-1}([0, 0])} (+1) = |f^{-1}([0, 0])|,\n$$\nwhich is the number of points in the preimage of $[0, 0]$. We need to find all points $p = [\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}]$ such that $f(p) = [0, 0]$. This means $[2\\theta_{1}, 3\\theta_{2}] = [0, 0]$, which is equivalent to the conditions:\n$$\n2\\theta_{1} = k_{1} \\quad \\text{for some integer } k_{1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n$$\n3\\theta_{2} = k_{2} \\quad \\text{for some integer } k_{2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThis gives $\\theta_{1} = k_{1}/2$ and $\\theta_{2} = k_{2}/3$. To find the distinct points in $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$, we can look for solutions in the fundamental domain $[0, 1) \\times [0, 1)$.\nFor $\\theta_{1}$, we requires $0 \\le k_{1}/2 < 1$, which implies $0 \\le k_{1} < 2$. So $k_{1}$ can be $0$ or $1$, giving $\\theta_{1} = 0$ or $\\theta_{1} = 1/2$. There are $2$ such values.\nFor $\\theta_{2}$, we require $0 \\le k_{2}/3 < 1$, which implies $0 \\le k_{2} < 3$. So $k_{2}$ can be $0$, $1$, or $2$, giving $\\theta_{2} = 0$, $\\theta_{2} = 1/3$, or $\\theta_{2} = 2/3$. There are $3$ such values.\n\nThe distinct points in the preimage $f^{-1}([0, 0])$ are represented by the pairs $(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2})$ where $\\theta_{1} \\in \\{0, 1/2\\}$ and $\\theta_{2} \\in \\{0, 1/3, 2/3\\}$. The total number of such pairs is $2 \\times 3 = 6$. These points are:\n$[0, 0]$, $[0, 1/3]$, $[0, 2/3]$, $[1/2, 0]$, $[1/2, 1/3]$, $[1/2, 2/3]$.\nAll these $6$ points are distinct in $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$. Therefore, the cardinality of the preimage is $|f^{-1}([0, 0])| = 6$.\nThe topological degree of $f$ is thus $\\deg(f) = 6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$", "id": "2999401"}]}
