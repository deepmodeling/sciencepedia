Let $p \\in M$ be a fixed point.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Tangent Space Basis and Dual Basis**\n\nThe tangent space $T_{p}M$ is defined as the vector space of all derivations at $p$. A derivation at $p$ is a linear map $v: C^{\\infty}(M) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the product rule (Leibniz rule):\n$$v(fg) = f(p)v(g) + g(p)v(f) \\quad \\forall f, g \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$$\nwhere $C^{\\infty}(M)$ is the algebra of smooth real-valued functions on $M$.\n\nFor each coordinate $x^{i}$, we define an operator $\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}$ by its action on any smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}(f) := \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p)$$\nThis operator is a derivation because it is linear and satisfies the Leibniz rule, inheriting these properties directly from the standard partial derivative.\n\nTo show that the set $\\left\\{\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ forms a basis for $T_{p}M$, we must prove linear independence and that it spans the space.\n- **Linear Independence**: Assume a linear combination is the zero derivation: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p} = 0$ for some coefficients $c^{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying this derivation to the coordinate function $x^{j}$ for any $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ gives:\n$$0 = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}\\right)(x^{j}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\delta^{j}{}_{i} = c^{j}$$\nThus, $c^{j}=0$ for all $j$, proving linear independence.\n- **Spanning**: Let $v \\in T_{p}M$ be an arbitrary derivation. For any $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$, Taylor's theorem at $p$ gives $f(x) = f(p) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p)(x^{i} - p^{i}) + O((x-p)^{2})$. Any derivation $v$ annihilates constants, so $v(f(p))=0$. Applying $v$ to the expansion and using the Leibniz rule shows that $v$ annihilates terms of order $2$ and higher in $(x-p)$. Thus, $v(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) v(x^{i})$. If we define the coefficients $v^{i} := v(x^{i})$, we can write $v(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i} \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}\\right)(f)$.

For this problem, its dimension is $2$.\nThe Riemannian metric $g$ at $p$ is a symmetric, positive-definite bilinear form on the tangent space $T_pM$. This structure induces an inner product on the cotangent space $T^*_pM$. As defined in the problem, for any two covectors $\\alpha, \\beta \\in T^*_pM$, this induced inner product, denoted $g^{-1}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, is given by $g^{-1}(\\alpha,\\beta) = g(g^{-1}\\alpha, g^{-1}\\beta)$, where $g^{-1}: T^*_pM \\to T_pM$ is the musical isomorphism mapping covectors to vectors. Since $g$ is an inner product on $T_pM$ and the musical isomorphism is an isomorphism of vector spaces, the induced bilinear form $g^{-1}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is also symmetric and positive-definite, thus making it a valid inner product on $T^*_pM$.\nConsequently, $(T^*_pM, g^{-1})$ is a finite-dimensional inner product space.\n\nThe Gram-Schmidt process is a standard algorithm that takes a finite, linearly independent set of vectors in any inner product space and generates an orthonormal set of vectors spanning the same subspace.\nThe given initial coframe $\\{\\theta^1, \\theta^2\\}$ consists of two covectors, $\\theta^1 = dx^1 + dx^2$ and $\\theta^2 = 2dx^1 + dx^2$. In the basis $\\{dx^1, dx^2\\}$, these have coefficient vectors $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 1)$, respectively. The determinant of the matrix of these coefficients is $1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 2 = -1 \\neq 0$, which confirms that $\\{\\theta^1, \\theta^2\\}$ is a linearly independent set and thus forms a basis for the $2$-dimensional space $T^*_pM$.\n\nBy its very definition, applying the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the basis $\\{\\theta^1, \\theta^2\\}$ with respect to the inner product $g^{-1}$ will produce an orthonormal basis for $T^*_pM$, which is the desired orthonormal coframe $\\{\\omega^1, \\omega^2\\}$.

In local coordinates $(x^1,\\dots,x^n)$ near $p$ with coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_i\\}$ and dual basis $\\{\\mathrm{d}x^i\\}$, if $\\omega=\\omega_i\\,\\mathrm{d}x^i$ and $g_p$ has matrix $(g_{ij}(p))$, then $\\omega^\\sharp$ at $p$ has components $v^i$ determined by $g_{ij}(p)\\,v^j=\\omega_i$, equivalently $v^i=g^{ij}(p)\\,\\omega_j$, where $(g^{ij}(p))$ is the inverse matrix of $(g_{ij}(p))$.", "solution": "We begin from the definitions: for a fixed point $p \\in M$, the Riemannian metric $g_p$ is a positive-definite, symmetric, nondegenerate bilinear form on the tangent space $T_pM$. The nondegeneracy means that the linear map\n$$\n\\flat_{g_p} : T_pM \\to T_p^*M,\\quad v \\mapsto v^\\flat,\\quad \\text{with } v^\\flat(\\cdot)=g_p(v,\\cdot),\n$$\nis an isomorphism of vector spaces. Its inverse is\n$$\n\\sharp_{g_p} : T_p^*M \\to T_pM,\\quad \\omega \\mapsto \\omega^\\sharp,\n$$\ncharacterized by $g_p(\\omega^\\sharp,\\cdot)=\\omega(\\cdot)$. If the bilinear form is changed, the induced isomorphisms change unless the bilinear forms coincide, because each such isomorphism is the unique Riesz representation associated to the given inner product.\n\nTo see the dependence concretely, choose local coordinates $(x^1,\\dots,x^n)$ around $p$ with basis $\\{\\partial_i\\}$ of $T_pM$ and dual basis $\\{\\mathrm{d}x^i\\}$ of $T_p^*M$. Write $\\omega=\\omega_i\\,\\mathrm{d}x^i$ and $v=v^i \\partial_i$. The defining relation $g_p(v,\\cdot)=\\omega(\\cdot)$ becomes in coordinates\n$$\ng_{ij}(p)\\,v^j=\\omega_i,\n$$\nwith $g_{ij}(p)=g_p(\\partial_i,\\partial_j)$. Since $(g_{ij}(p))$ is invertible, this yields $v^i=g^{ij}(p)\\,\\omega_j$, where $(g^{ij}(p))$ is the inverse matrix. If we change the metric, we replace $(g_{ij}(p))$ by a different invertible matrix and hence obtain different components $v^i$ in general.\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nA. This statement restates the mechanism just derived: the musical maps are precisely the isomorphisms induced by the nondegenerate bilinear pairing $g_p(\\cdot,\\cdot)$. If the pairing is altered, the identification between $T_pM$ and $T_p^*M$ changes. This is correct. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Compute explicitly. On $M=\\mathbb{R}^2$ with $(x,y)$, at $p=(0,0)$ take $\\omega=\\mathrm{d}x+\\mathrm{d}y$. With $g_p=\\mathrm{d}x^2+\\mathrm{d}y^2$, the metric matrix is\n$$\nG=\\begin{pmatrix}1  0\\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nWriting $\\omega$ in components as $(\\omega_x,\\omega_y)=(1,1)$, the defining equation $G\\,v=\\omega$ yields $v=(1,1)$, i.e., $\\omega^\\sharp=\\partial_x+\\partial_y$. With $h_p$ having matrix\n$$\nH=\\mathrm{diag}(2,1)=\\begin{pmatrix}2  0\\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nthe same equation $H\\,v=\\omega$ yields $v=(\\tfrac{1}{2},1)$, i.e., $\\omega^\\sharp=(\\tfrac{1}{2})\\partial_x+\\partial_y$. Thus changing the metric changes $\\omega^\\sharp$ at $p$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. If $h=\\lambda\\, g$ with $\\lambda0$ smooth, then at $p$ one has $h_p=\\lambda(p)\\, g_p$. For a fixed $\\omega \\in T_p^*M$, the vector $v_h$ satisfying $h_p(v_h,\\cdot)=\\omega(\\cdot)$ must obey\n$$\n\\lambda(p)\\, g_p(v_h,\\cdot)=\\omega(\\cdot).\n$$\nEquivalently, $g_p(v_h,\\cdot)=(1/\\lambda(p))\\,\\omega(\\cdot)$, so $v_h=(1/\\lambda(p))\\,\\omega^\\sharp$ where $\\omega^\\sharp$ is computed with $g_p$. Unless $\\lambda(p)=1$ or $\\omega=0$, $v_h \\neq \\omega^\\sharp$. Therefore the claim that $\\omega^\\sharp$ is unchanged is false. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. If $g_p=h_p$ as bilinear forms on $T_pM$, then the defining equations for the two sharp maps at $p$ are identical: for any $\\omega \\in T_p^*M$, both require $g_p(v,\\cdot)=\\omega(\\cdot)$. Uniqueness of solutions implies the resulting vectors coincide, so $\\omega^\\sharp$ at $p$ is the same for both metrics. Therefore there do not exist such examples with difference at $p$ when the metrics agree at $p$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This is exactly the coordinate expression of the defining relation $g_p(v,\\cdot)=\\omega(\\cdot)$ and its solution using the inverse metric matrix. It follows from the linear algebra of nondegenerate bilinear forms and the definition of the musical isomorphism. Verdict: Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2994041"}]}
