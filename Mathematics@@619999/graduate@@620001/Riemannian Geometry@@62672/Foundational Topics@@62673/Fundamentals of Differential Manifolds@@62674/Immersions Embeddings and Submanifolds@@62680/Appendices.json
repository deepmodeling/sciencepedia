Express the integer exactly.", "solution": "The problem as stated is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in introductory differential geometry. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThis problem is divided into three parts. First, we will distinguish the concepts of immersion, local diffeomorphism, and embedding for a smooth map $f:M \\to N$ between manifolds of equal dimension $n$, clarifying the role of the Inverse Function Theorem. Second, we will apply these definitions to a specific map $f:S^{1} \\to S^{1}$. Third, we will compute a topological invariant, the Brouwer degree, for this map.\n\nFor a smooth map $f: M \\to N$, we have the following definitions:\n1.  $f$ is an **immersion** if for every point $p \\in M$, the differential map $df_p: T_pM \\to T_{f(p)}N$ is injective.\n2.  $f$ is a **local diffeomorphism** if for every point $p \\in M$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $M$ such that $f(U)$ is an open neighborhood of $f(p)$ in $N$ and the restriction $f|_U: U \\to f(U)$ is a diffeomorphism.\n3.  $f$ is an **embedding** if it is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism from $M$ onto its image $f(M)$, where $f(M)$ is endowed with the subspace topology inherited from $N$.\n\nIn the specific case where $\\dim M = \\dim N = n$, the tangent spaces $T_pM$ and $T_{f(p)}N$ are both real vector spaces of dimension $n$. A linear map between finite-dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension is injective if and only if it is surjective, which is equivalent to it being an isomorphism. Therefore, for a map $f: M \\to N$ with $\\dim M = \\dim N = n$, the condition that the differential $df_p$ is injective (the definition of an immersion at $p$) is equivalent to the condition that $df_p$ is an isomorphism.\n\nThe Inverse Function Theorem for manifolds states that a smooth map $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at a point $p$ if and only if its differential $df_p$ is a linear isomorphism.\n\nCombining these two facts, we find a crucial simplification for maps between manifolds of equal dimension:\nA smooth map $f: M \\to N$ where $\\dim M = \\dim N$ is an immersion if and only if it is a local diffeomorphism. This is because the condition for being an immersion at every point (all $df_p$ are injective) is equivalent to the condition for being a local diffeomorphism at every point (all $df_p$ are isomorphisms).\n\nAn embedding is a more restrictive concept. It requires the map to be an immersion (and thus a local diffeomorphism in this case), but it adds a global topological condition: the map must be a homeomorphism onto its image. For $f$ to be a homeomorphism onto its image, it must be globally injective, and the inverse map $f^{-1}: f(M) \\to M$ must be continuous. A local diffeomorphism can fail to be an embedding if it is not globally injective, or if it is injective but not a homeomorphism onto its image (e.g., an injective immersion whose image is not a submanifold, like an irrational-slope line on a torus).\n\nNow we consider the second part of the problem. We are given the map $f:S^{1} \\to S^{1}$ defined in complex notation by $f(\\exp(i\\theta))=\\exp(i \\cdot 2\\theta)$. We identify $S^{1}$ with the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}/(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})$, where a point is parameterized by an angle $\\theta$. In this coordinate, the map $f$ is simply $\\theta \\mapsto 2\\theta$.\n\nTo determine if $f$ is a local diffeomorphism, we examine its differential. The tangent space at any point of $S^1$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space, spanned by the tangent vector $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}$ in the local coordinate $\\theta$. The effect of the differential $df$ on this basis vector is given by the derivative of the map's coordinate representation. Let the coordinate on the domain be $\\theta$ and on the codomain be $\\phi$. The map is $\\phi = 2\\theta$. The differential is given by:\n$$\ndf\\left(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{d(2\\theta)}{d\\theta} \\frac{d}{d\\phi} = 2 \\frac{d}{d\\phi}\n$$\nAt any point $p \\in S^1$, the differential $df_p$ is a linear map from a $1$-dimensional space to a $1$-dimensional space, represented by multiplication by the scalar $2$. Since $2 \\neq 0$, this map is an isomorphism for every $p \\in S^1$. Because its differential is an isomorphism everywhere, $f$ is a local diffeomorphism.\n\nTo show that $f$ is not an embedding, we must show it either fails to be an immersion (which we have just shown it is) or fails to be a homeomorphism onto its image. A homeomorphism must be injective. Let's test for injectivity. Consider two distinct points on the domain $S^1$, for example $p_1 = \\exp(i \\cdot 0) = 1$ and $p_2 = \\exp(i\\pi) = -1$. We apply the map $f$ to these points:\n$$\nf(p_1) = f(\\exp(i \\cdot 0)) = \\exp(i \\cdot 2 \\cdot 0) = \\exp(0) = 1\n$$\n$$\nf(p_2) = f(\\exp(i\\pi)) = \\exp(i \\cdot 2\\pi) = 1\n$$\nSince $p_1 \\neq p_2$ but $f(p_1) = f(p_2)$, the map $f$ is not injective. A map that is not injective cannot be a homeomorphism onto its image. Therefore, $f$ is not an embedding.\n\nFinally, for the third part, we compute the Brouwer degree of $f$, which is given by the formula\n$$\n\\deg(f)=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} f^{*}\\omega}{\\displaystyle\\int_{S^{1}} \\omega}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega$ is any smooth nowhere-vanishing $1$-form on $S^{1}$ that induces the given (standard) orientation. The standard orientation on $S^1$ is the counter-clockwise orientation, corresponding to the direction of increasing $\\theta$. The coordinate chart $\\theta$ on $S^1$ gives rise to a tangent vector field $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}$ which represents this orientation. A simple choice for a $1$-form $\\omega$ that is positive on this vector field is $\\omega = d\\theta$. Although $\\theta$ itself is not a globally defined function on $S^1$, its exterior derivative $d\\theta$ is a well-defined and nowhere-vanishing global $1$-form.\n\nWe first compute the integral in the denominator. We parameterize $S^1$ by the map $\\gamma: [0, 2\\pi] \\to S^1$, with $\\gamma(t) = \\exp(it)$. The integral of the $1$-form $\\omega = d\\theta$ over $S^1$ is:\n$$\n\\int_{S^1} \\omega = \\int_{S^1} d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma^*(d\\theta)\n$$\nThe pullback of the coordinate function $\\theta$ by the parametrization $\\gamma$ is just $t$, so $\\gamma^*(\\theta) = t$. Thus, $\\gamma^*(d\\theta) = d(\\gamma^*\\theta) = dt$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} dt = [t]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi\n$$\nNext, we compute the integral in the numerator, which involves the pullback $f^*\\omega$. The map $f$ sends a point with coordinate $\\theta$ to a point with coordinate $2\\theta$. Let's denote the coordinate on the domain manifold as $\\theta_1$ and on the target manifold as $\\theta_2$. The map is $\\theta_2 = 2\\theta_1$, and the form on the target is $\\omega=d\\theta_2$. The pullback is calculated as:\n$$\nf^*\\omega = f^*(d\\theta_2) = d(f^*\\theta_2) = d(\\theta_2 \\circ f) = d(2\\theta_1) = 2 d\\theta_1\n$$\nSo, the pulled-back form is $2d\\theta_1$. We now integrate this form over the domain $S^1$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^1} f^*\\omega = \\int_{S^1} 2 d\\theta_1 = 2 \\int_{S^1} d\\theta_1\n$$\nThis integral is identical in form to the one in the denominator, so its value is also $2\\pi$. Thus:\n$$\n\\int_{S^1} f^*\\omega = 2(2\\pi) = 4\\pi\n$$\nFinally, we compute the degree by taking the ratio:\n$$\n\\deg(f) = \\frac{4\\pi}{2\\pi} = 2\n$$\nThe Brouwer degree of the map $f$ is the integer $2$.

We will address each part of the problem sequentially.\n\n1) First, we verify that $\\gamma$ is an immersion. A smooth map between manifolds is an immersion if its differential is everywhere injective. For a curve $\\gamma: S^{1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, this is equivalent to the condition that its velocity vector $\\gamma'(\\theta) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{d\\theta}$ is non-zero for all $\\theta \\in S^1$.\n\nThe map is given by $\\gamma(\\theta) = (\\sin(\\theta), \\sin(2\\theta))$. The velocity vector is obtained by differentiating with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\gamma'(\\theta) = \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sin(\\theta), \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sin(2\\theta)\\right) = (\\cos(\\theta), 2\\cos(2\\theta)).\n$$\nFor $\\gamma$ to be an immersion, we must show that $\\gamma'(\\theta) \\neq (0,0)$ for any value of $\\theta$. Let us assume $\\gamma'(\\theta) = (0,0)$ and seek a contradiction. This implies the following system of equations:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\cos(2\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\cos(2\\theta) = 0\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $\\cos(\\theta) = 0$, we know that $\\theta$ must be of the form $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\nLet's substitute this into the second equation using the double angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = 2\\cos^2(\\theta) - 1$. If $\\cos(\\theta)=0$, then $\\cos(2\\theta) = 2(0)^2 - 1 = -1$.\nAlternatively, for $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$, we have $2\\theta = \\pi + 2k\\pi$. Then $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos(\\pi + 2k\\pi) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\nIn either case, if $\\cos(\\theta) = 0$, then $\\cos(2\\theta) = -1$, which is not equal to $0$. Therefore, the two components of $\\gamma'(\\theta)$ cannot be simultaneously zero. We conclude that $\\gamma'(\\theta)$ is never the zero vector, and thus $\\gamma$ is an immersion.\n\n2) Next, we identify the self-intersections of $\\gamma$ and check for transversality. A self-intersection occurs at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ if there exist distinct $\\theta_1, \\theta_2 \\in S^1$ (i.e., $\\theta_1 \\neq \\theta_2 \\pmod{2\\pi}$) such that $\\gamma(\\theta_1) = \\gamma(\\theta_2) = p$.\nThe condition $\\gamma(\\theta_1) = \\gamma(\\theta_2)$ gives the system of equations:\n$$\n\\text{(i)} \\quad \\sin(\\theta_1) = \\sin(\\theta_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(ii)} \\quad \\sin(2\\theta_1) = \\sin(2\\theta_2)\n$$\nFrom equation (i), for $\\theta_1 \\neq \\theta_2$ in $[0, 2\\pi)$, we must have $\\theta_2 = \\pi - \\theta_1$. Substituting this into equation (ii) yields $\\sin(2\\theta_1) = \\sin(2(\\pi - \\theta_1)) = -\\sin(2\\theta_1)$, which means $\\sin(2\\theta_1)=0$. This implies $\\theta_1 = k\\pi/2$. The only case that gives distinct $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ is $\\theta_1=0$, which yields $\\theta_2=\\pi$ (and vice versa). Thus, there is a single self-intersection at $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(\\pi)=(0,0)$, corresponding to the pair of preimages $\\{0, \\pi\\}$.\n\nNow we must prove that this self-intersection is transverse. This means the velocity vectors $\\gamma'(\\theta_1)$ and $\\gamma'(\\theta_2)$ are linearly independent. Let $\\theta_1 = 0$ and $\\theta_2 = \\pi$.\nThe velocity vectors are:\n$$\nv_1 = \\gamma'(0) = (\\cos(0), 2\\cos(0)) = (1, 2)\n$$\n$$\nv_2 = \\gamma'(\\pi) = (\\cos(\\pi), 2\\cos(2\\pi)) = (-1, 2)\n$$\nTo check for linear independence, we form a matrix with these vectors as columns and compute its determinant:\n$$\n\\det[v_1\\; v_2] = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(2) - (-1)(2) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n$$\nSince the determinant is $4 \\neq 0$, the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent. Thus, the self-intersection at $(0,0)$ is transverse.\n\n3) We compute the local intersection sign at the transverse double point. The problem defines this sign as $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\det[v_1\\; v_2])$. To have a well-defined sign, we use the standard orientation on $S^1$ (increasing $\\theta$) to order the preimages. We choose $\\theta_1 = 0$ and $\\theta_2 = \\pi$ since $0  \\pi$.\nWith this ordering, $v_1 = \\gamma'(0)$ and $v_2 = \\gamma'(\\pi)$. The determinant has already been computed:\n$$\n\\det[v_1\\; v_2] = 4.\n$$\nThe local intersection sign is therefore:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\det[v_1\\; v_2]) = \\operatorname{sgn}(4) = +1.\n$$\n\n4) We explain why the image $\\gamma(S^1)$ is not the image of any embedding of $S^1$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nAn embedding is an immersion $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ that is also a homeomorphism onto its image $f(S^1)$. A key property of a homeomorphism is that it preserves topological properties.\nThe image set is $K = \\gamma(S^1)$. For $K$ to be the image of an embedding of $S^1$, it must be homeomorphic to $S^1$.\nLet's compare the topological properties of $S^1$ and $K$. Consider the effect of removing a point.\nIf we remove any point from $S^1$, the resulting space is connected (it is homeomorphic to an open interval).\nNow consider the space $K$, which has the shape of a figure-eight. The self-intersection point is $p = (0,0)$. If we remove this point from $K$, the space $K \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is the union of the set of points $\\gamma(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$ and the set of points $\\gamma(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$. These two sets correspond to the two distinct loops of the figure-eight, meeting only at $p$. Thus, $K \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is disconnected and has two connected components.\nSince removing one point from $S^1$ results in a connected space, while removing the point $p=(0,0)$ from $K$ results in a disconnected space, $S^1$ and $K$ cannot be homeomorphic.\nTherefore, there cannot exist any embedding of $S^1$ whose image is $K = \\gamma(S^1)$. The existence of a self-intersection point prevents the map $\\gamma$ from being injective, which is a necessary condition for it to be a homeomorphism onto its image. The topological argument shows that no *other* map can embed $S^1$ as this figure-eight shape either.\n\nFinally, we compute the algebraic self-intersection number of $\\gamma$. This is defined as the sum of the local intersection signs over all transverse self-intersections.\nWe found exactly one transverse self-intersection point, $p=(0,0)$, which arises from the preimages $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$.\nWe computed the local intersection sign at this point to be $+1$.\nSince there is only one such intersection, the sum consists of a single term.\nThe algebraic self-intersection number is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2980326"}, {"introduction": "This practice advances from submanifolds to the more general and ubiquitous concept of submanifolds with boundary.

Since both $\\psi$ and $g$ are smooth, their composition $f$ is also a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNext, we identify the set $M=f^{-1}(0)$ and prove it is a smooth embedded submanifold with boundary.\nFrom the definition of $\\psi$, we have $\\psi(t)=0$ if and only if $t \\leq 0$.\nTherefore, the zero set $M=f^{-1}(0)$ is given by\n$$ M = \\{ (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\,:\\, \\psi(x_1 - \\phi(x_2, \\dots, x_n)) = 0 \\} $$\n$$ M = \\{ (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\,:\\, x_1 - \\phi(x_2, \\dots, x_n) \\leq 0 \\}. $$\nThis is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

Its image $V = \\Phi_p(U)$ is an open neighborhood of the origin in the $y$-coordinate space. The diffeomorphism $\\Phi_p$ restricted to $U$ maps $M \\cap U$ to $V \\cap \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : y_1 \\leq 0\\}$ and $\\partial M \\cap U$ to $V \\cap \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : y_1 = 0\\}$. This is precisely the local characterization of a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold with boundary. The boundary $\\partial M$ is the set where $x_1 = \\phi(x_2, \\dots, x_n)$, which is an $(n-1)$-dimensional smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The inclusion of $M$ into $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is an embedding, thus $M$ is a smooth embedded submanifold with boundary.\n\nNow, we specialize to $n=3$ and $\\phi(x_2, x_3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_2^2 + 2x_3^2)$, and compute the mean curvature $H$ of the boundary surface $\\partial M$ at the origin.\nThe boundary $\\partial M$ is the surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ given by the equation $x_1 = \\phi(x_2, x_3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_2^2 + 2x_3^2)$. The point in question is the origin $(0,0,0)$, which lies on this surface since $\\phi(0,0)=0$.\nThe mean curvature $H$ of a surface defined as the graph of a function $x_1 = \\phi(x_2, x_3)$ is given by the formula:\n$$ H = \\frac{(1+\\phi_{x_3}^2)\\phi_{x_2x_2} - 2\\phi_{x_2}\\phi_{x_3}\\phi_{x_2x_3} + (1+\\phi_{x_2}^2)\\phi_{x_3x_3}}{2(1+\\phi_{x_2}^2+\\phi_{x_3}^2)^{3/2}} $$\nThis formula assumes the normal vector points in the positive $x_1$ direction, which matches the problem's specification since the gradient of $G(x_1,x_2,x_3) = x_1-\\phi(x_2,x_3)$ is $(1, -\\phi_{x_2}, -\\phi_{x_3})$.\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives of $\\phi(x_2, x_3)$:\n- First-order partial derivatives:\n  $$ \\phi_{x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x_2^2 + 2x_3^2)\\right) = x_2 $$\n  $$ \\phi_{x_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x_2^2 + 2x_3^2)\\right) = 2x_3 $$\n- Second-order partial derivatives:\n  $$ \\phi_{x_2x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}(x_2) = 1 $$\n  $$ \\phi_{x_3x_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3}(2x_3) = 2 $$\n  $$ \\phi_{x_2x_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3}(x_2) = 0 $$\nWe evaluate these derivatives at the origin, where $(x_2, x_3) = (0,0)$:\n$$ \\phi_{x_2}(0,0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\phi_{x_3}(0,0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\phi_{x_2x_2}(0,0) = 1 $$\n$$ \\phi_{x_3x_3}(0,0) = 2 $$\n$$ \\phi_{x_2x_3}(0,0) = 0 $$\nNote that the condition $\\nabla\\phi(\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{0}$ from the problem statement ensures the first derivatives vanish at the origin.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the mean curvature $H$:\n$$ H(0,0,0) = \\frac{(1+0^2)(1) - 2(0)(0)(0) + (1+0^2)(2)}{2(1+0^2+0^2)^{3/2}} $$\n$$ H(0,0,0) = \\frac{1(1) + 1(2)}{2(1)^{3/2}} = \\frac{1+2}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}. $$\nThe mean curvature of the surface $\\partial M$ at the origin is $\\frac{3}{2}$. This value is half the trace of the Hessian matrix of $\\phi$ at the origin, a known result for surfaces given by graphs at a critical point of the height function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "2980328"}]}
