The problem is mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The task is to evaluate the truth of specific mathematical propositions, which is a well-posed problem.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, formal, and free of ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with no internal contradictions or missing information. The analysis can proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe uniqueness of an integral curve $\\gamma(t)$ through a point $p$ on a manifold $M$ is equivalent to the uniqueness of the solution to the initial value problem (IVP) for the corresponding ODE in a local chart around $p$. The IVP is given by $\\dot{u}(t)=F(u(t))$ with the initial condition $u(0)=\\varphi(p)$.\n\nThe fundamental theorems governing this are:\n1.  **Peano Existence Theorem**: If the function $F$ is continuous, there exists at least one local solution to the IVP. Uniqueness is not guaranteed.\n2.  **Picard-Lindelöf (or Cauchy-Lipschitz) Theorem**: If the function $F$ is locally Lipschitz continuous, there exists a unique local solution to the IVP. A function $F$ is locally Lipschitz at a point $u_0$ if there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $u_0$ and a constant $L>0$ such that for all $u_1, u_2 \\in V$, $\\|F(u_1)-F(u_2)\\| \\le L \\|u_1-u_2\\|$. A sufficient condition for $F$ to be locally Lipschitz is that $F$ is of class $C^1$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**Option A: There exists a continuous vector field $X$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ given by $X(x)=2\\sqrt{|x|}$ such that, through $x=0$, there are infinitely many integral curves (for example, $x(t)\\equiv 0$ and $x(t)=(t-\\tau)^{2}$ for $t\\ge \\tau$, $x(t)\\equiv 0$ for $t\\le \\tau$, with any $\\tau\\ge 0$), so the local flow fails to be well defined at $x=0$.**\n\nThe manifold is $M=\\mathbb{R}$, which is a $1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The vector field is $X(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|} \\frac{d}{dx}$. In the global coordinate chart $\\text{Id}: \\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, the coordinate representation is $F(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$. This function is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ since $\\lim_{x\\to 0} F(x) = 0 = F(0)$. The integral curve equation through $p=0$ is the IVP $\\dot{x}(t) = 2\\sqrt{|x(t)|}$ with $x(0)=0$.\n\n- **Solution 1**: The trivial solution is $x_1(t) \\equiv 0$. The derivative is $\\dot{x}_1(t)=0$, and the right side is $2\\sqrt{|0|}=0$. The initial condition $x_1(0)=0$ is met. This is a valid integral curve.\n\n- **Solution 2 (family of solutions)**: For any constant $\\tau \\ge 0$, consider the function\n$$x_\\tau(t) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } t \\le \\tau \\\\ (t-\\tau)^2 & \\text{if } t > \\tau \\end{cases}$$\nFor any choice of $\\tau \\ge 0$, the initial condition $x_\\tau(0)=0$ is satisfied. We must verify that $x_\\tau(t)$ is a solution to the ODE for all $t$ in an interval around $0$.\n- For $t  \\tau$, $\\dot{x}_\\tau(t)=0$ and $2\\sqrt{|x_\\tau(t)|}=2\\sqrt{0}=0$. The equation holds.\n- For $t > \\tau$, $x_\\tau(t)=(t-\\tau)^2 > 0$. The derivative is $\\dot{x}_\\tau(t) = 2(t-\\tau)$. The right side is $2\\sqrt{|x_\\tau(t)|} = 2\\sqrt{(t-\\tau)^2} = 2|t-\\tau| = 2(t-\\tau)$, since $t>\\tau$. The equation holds.\n- At $t=\\tau$, we check differentiability. The left-derivative is $\\lim_{h\\to 0^-}\\frac{x_\\tau(\\tau+h)-x_\\tau(\\tau)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^-}\\frac{0-0}{h} = 0$. The right-derivative is $\\lim_{h\\to 0^+}\\frac{x_\\tau(\\tau+h)-x_\\tau(\\tau)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+}\\frac{((\\tau+h)-\\tau)^2-0}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+}\\frac{h^2}{h}=0$. Since the left and right derivatives match, $\\dot{x}_\\tau(\\tau)=0$. The ODE requires $\\dot{x}_\\tau(\\tau) = 2\\sqrt{|x_\\tau(\\tau)|}$, which is $0=2\\sqrt{0}$, so it holds.\n\nThus, for each $\\tau \\ge 0$, we have a distinct, valid solution to the same IVP. This demonstrates the existence of infinitely many integral curves through $x=0$. Consequently, a unique flow $\\Phi(t,0)$ cannot be defined. The reason for non-uniqueness is that $F(x)=2\\sqrt{|x|}$ is not locally Lipschitz at $x=0$, as $\\frac{|F(x)-F(0)|}{|x-0|} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{|x|}}{|x|} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{|x|}} \\to \\infty$ as $x\\to 0$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**Option B: If $X$ is of class $C^{1}$ on $M$, then in any coordinate chart the corresponding map $F$ is locally Lipschitz, and hence for each $p\\in M$ there is a unique maximal integral curve through $p$ on some open interval containing $0$; consequently, a unique local flow exists near $p$.**\n\nThis statement presents a chain of standard results from ODE theory.\n1.  If $X$ is a $C^1$ vector field on $M$, its coordinate representation $F$ in any chart is a $C^1$ map between open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n2.  A $C^1$ function $F$ on an open set $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally Lipschitz. To see this, for any $u \\in V$, choose a closed ball $\\bar{B}(u,r) \\subset V$. The Jacobian $DF$ of $F$ is continuous on the compact set $\\bar{B}(u,r)$, so its operator norm is bounded, i.e., $\\sup_{y \\in \\bar{B}(u,r)} \\|DF(y)\\| = L  \\infty$. By the Mean Value Theorem, for any $y_1, y_2 \\in \\bar{B}(u,r)$, we have $\\|F(y_1)-F(y_2)\\| \\le \\left(\\sup_{c \\in [y_1,y_2]} \\|DF(c)\\|\\right) \\|y_1-y_2\\| \\le L \\|y_1-y_2\\|$. This establishes that $F$ is locally Lipschitz.\n3.  The Picard-Lindelöf theorem states that if $F$ is locally Lipschitz, the IVP $\\dot{u}=F(u)$, $u(0)=u_0$, has a unique local solution.\n4.  Standard theory on ODEs further guarantees that this unique local solution can be extended to a unique maximal interval of existence. This corresponds to a unique maximal integral curve.\n5.  The existence and uniqueness of the integral curve for each point in a neighborhood of $p$, combined with the continuous dependence of solutions on initial conditions (also guaranteed under the Lipschitz condition), allows for the definition of a unique local flow.\n\nThe statement is a correct summary of the fundamental theorem on the existence and uniqueness of flows for $C^1$ vector fields.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**Option C: On a geodesically complete Riemannian manifold $\\left(M,g\\right)$, geodesic completeness alone implies uniqueness of integral curves for every continuous vector field $X$.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly links a property of the manifold's metric ($g$) with a property of the vector field ($X$). Geodesic completeness means that geodesics can be extended indefinitely. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, this is equivalent to the manifold being a complete metric space. However, the uniqueness of integral curves for a vector field $X$ depends on the regularity of $X$ (e.g., being locally Lipschitz), not on the completeness of the manifold.\n\nWe can disprove this with a counterexample. Let $M=\\mathbb{R}$ with its usual metric. This is a geodesically complete Riemannian manifold. Now, consider the continuous vector field $X(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}\\frac{d}{dx}$ from option A. As established in the analysis of option A, this vector field does not have unique integral curves through the point $p=0$. Therefore, geodesic completeness of the manifold does not guarantee uniqueness for merely continuous vector fields.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: If $X$ is continuous and locally bounded on $M$, then for every $p\\in M$ there is a unique integral curve through $p$ defined for all $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$.**\n\nThis statement makes two strong claims: uniqueness and global existence (existence for all $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$). Both are false under the given hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Uniqueness**: As the counterexample in option A shows, continuity is not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness. The vector field $X(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}\\frac{d}{dx}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and locally bounded (it is bounded on any bounded interval), yet integral curves are not unique through $x=0$.\n2.  **Global Existence**: Even for a smooth ($C^\\infty$) vector field, integral curves are not guaranteed to exist for all time. A classic counterexample is the vector field $X(x) = x^2 \\frac{d}{dx}$ on $M=\\mathbb{R}$. This field is $C^\\infty$ and thus continuous and locally bounded. The IVP is $\\dot{x}=x^2$ with $x(0)=x_0>0$. The solution is $x(t) = \\frac{x_0}{1-x_0 t}$. This solution experiences a finite-time blow-up at $t=1/x_0$ and is therefore not defined for all $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$. A sufficient, but not necessary, condition for global existence on a complete manifold is for the vector field to be globally bounded, which is much stronger than locally bounded.\n\nSince both claims in the statement are false, the statement as a whole is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: If, in a chart, the coordinate representation $F$ of $X$ is locally Hölder continuous of order $\\alpha\\in\\left(0,1\\right)$, then integral curves through each point are unique.**\n\nA function $F$ is locally Hölder continuous of order $\\alpha$ if for any point, there is a neighborhood where $\\|F(u_1)-F(u_2)\\| \\le C\\|u_1-u_2\\|^\\alpha$ for some constant $C>0$. The Lipschitz condition corresponds to $\\alpha=1$. This statement claims that uniqueness holds for any $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.\n\nThis is false. The very counterexample from option A, $F(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$, is Hölder continuous of order $\\alpha=1/2$. We can see this by checking the condition at $x=0$:\n$|F(x)-F(0)| = |2\\sqrt{|x|} - 0| = 2|x|^{1/2}$.\nThis satisfies the Hölder condition with $\\alpha=1/2$ and $C=2$. Since $\\alpha=1/2 \\in (0,1)$ and we have already shown that solutions for this $F$ are not unique, the statement is disproven.\n\nUniqueness is guaranteed by Osgood's criterion, which requires the integral $\\int_0^\\epsilon \\frac{d\\rho}{\\omega(\\rho)}$ to diverge, where $\\omega$ is a modulus of continuity for $F$. For Hölder continuity with $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, $\\omega(\\rho) = C\\rho^\\alpha$. The integral becomes $\\int_0^\\epsilon \\frac{d\\rho}{C\\rho^\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{C}\\left[\\frac{\\rho^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha}\\right]_0^\\epsilon$, which converges because $1-\\alpha>0$. Since the integral converges, Osgood's criterion for uniqueness is not met, consistent with our counterexample.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2980924"}, {"introduction": "The Flow-Box or Straightening Theorem is a cornerstone result, revealing that locally, the flow of any non-vanishing smooth vector field is equivalent to a simple, constant-velocity translation.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed as specified.\n\nThe construction of the coordinate system $(u,v)$ will be carried out in the prescribed sequence of steps.\n\n**Step 1: Find an invariant function $v$ satisfying $X(v) = 0$.**\nAn integral curve of $X$, denoted by $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, is a solution to the system of ordinary differential equations given by $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = X(\\gamma(t))$. For $X = \\partial_{x} + x \\partial_{y}$, this corresponds to the system:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = x(t)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIntegrating the first equation, we find $x(t) = t + C_1$. Let the initial condition at $t=0$ be $(x_0, y_0)$, so $x(0) = x_0$, which gives $C_1 = x_0$. Thus, $x(t) = t + x_0$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives $\\frac{dy}{dt} = t + x_0$. Integrating with respect to $t$ yields $y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + x_0 t + C_2$. Using the initial condition $y(0) = y_0$, we get $C_2 = y_0$. The integral curve is therefore $\\gamma(t) = (t+x_0, \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + x_0 t + y_0)$.\n\nAn invariant function $v(x,y)$ is constant along these integral curves. We can find such a function by eliminating $t$ from the equations for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. From $x = t+x_0$, we have $t = x-x_0$.

The expression on the left, $y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$, depends only on the point $(x,y)$ and is constant along any given integral curve. We can therefore define our invariant function $v$ as:\n$$v(x,y) = y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$$\nTo confirm, we check if $X(v)=0$:\n$$X(v) = (\\partial_{x} + x \\partial_{y})(y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2) = \\partial_{x}(y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2) + x \\partial_{y}(y - \\frac{1}{2}x^2) = (-x) + x(1) = 0$$\nThis confirms our choice of $v$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a coordinate function $u$ satisfying $X(u) = 1$.**\nWe need to solve the first-order linear partial differential equation $X(u)=1$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 1$$\nWe seek a simple solution. Let's test a function of $x$ alone, $u(x,y) = f(x)$. The equation becomes $f'(x) + x \\cdot 0 = 1$, which means $f'(x) = 1$. Integrating gives $f(x)=x+C$.

It is a sound, well-posed, and formal mathematical problem. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe integral curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ is a path on the manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}$. We can represent this path by a function $x(t)$ where $x(t)$ is the coordinate of the point $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. The tangent vector to the curve is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{x_0}(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_{x(t)}$. The vector field is given as $X(x) = x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\n\nThe condition for an integral curve, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{x_0}(t) = X(\\gamma_{x_0}(t))$, translates into the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the coordinate function $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2\n$$\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = x_0$. We are asked to consider the case where $x_0 > 0$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the integral curves $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$**\n\nThe ODE is separable. For $x \\neq 0$, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a generic time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial position $x_0$ to $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{x_0}^{x(t)} \\frac{1}{\\xi^2} d\\xi = \\int_0^t d\\tau\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\xi} \\right]_{x_0}^{x(t)} = \\left[ \\tau \\right]_0^t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(t)} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{x_0}\\right) = t - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x_0} - \\frac{1}{x(t)} = t\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{1}{x_0} - t = \\frac{1 - x_0 t}{x_0}\n$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives the solution for the integral curve:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t}\n$$\nThis function represents the integral curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ in the standard coordinate on $\\mathbb{R}$. The domain of this solution, starting from $t=0$, is the interval where the denominator is non-zero. Since $x_0>0$, the denominator is positive near $t=0$. The solution is defined until the denominator becomes zero, which occurs at $t = 1/x_0$. Thus, the maximal interval of definition containing $t=0$ is $(-\\infty, 1/x_0)$.\n\n**2. Explanation of Finite-Time Blow-up and Incompleteness**\n\nThe fundamental extension criterion for ODEs on a manifold $M$ states that if a maximal integral curve $\\gamma: (a,b) \\to M$ has $b  \\infty$, then for any compact set $K \\subset M$, the curve $\\gamma(t)$ must eventually leave $K$ as $t \\to b^-$. That is, there exists some $t_K \\in (a,b)$ such that for all $t \\in (t_K, b)$, $\\gamma(t) \\notin K$.\n\nIn our case, the manifold is $M=\\mathbb{R}$. A compact set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is, by the Heine-Borel theorem, closed and bounded. Therefore, for any compact set $K$, there exists a real number $R>0$ such that $K \\subseteq [-R, R]$.\n\nThe forward-time part of the maximal interval of existence for the integral curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ is $[0, 1/x_0)$. The right endpoint is finite: $b = 1/x_0$. To show the curve blows up in finite time, we examine its behavior as $t$ approaches $1/x_0$ from below:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to (1/x_0)^-} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to (1/x_0)^-} \\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t}\n$$\nSince $x_0 > 0$, as $t \\to (1/x_0)^-$, the denominator $(1 - x_0 t)$ approaches $0$ from the positive side. Thus, the limit of $x(t)$ is $+\\infty$.\n\nThis means that for any compact set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, which is necessarily bounded, the curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ will eventually exceed the bounds of $K$. Specifically, for $K \\subseteq [-R, R]$, the curve leaves $K$ when $|x(t)| > R$. Since $x_0>0$ and $t \\in [0, 1/x_0)$, $x(t)$ is always positive, so we need $x(t) > R$. We solve for $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t} > R \\implies x_0 > R(1 - x_0 t) \\implies x_0 > R - R x_0 t \\implies R x_0 t > R - x_0 \\implies t > \\frac{R-x_0}{Rx_0} = \\frac{1}{x_0} - \\frac{1}{R}\n$$\nFor any $R > x_0$, the time $t_K = \\frac{1}{x_0} - \\frac{1}{R}$ is in the interval $(0, 1/x_0)$. For any $t$ in the interval $(t_K, 1/x_0)$, the value $x(t)$ is greater than $R$, so $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ is not in $K$. This formally verifies the condition of the extension criterion. The integral curve cannot be extended beyond $t=1/x_0$ because it \"escapes to infinity\" in finite time.\n\nA vector field is complete if its flow is defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The flow $\\Phi_t(x_0)$ is given by $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$. Since for any $x_0 > 0$, the integral curve $\\gamma_{x_0}(t)$ is not defined for $t \\ge 1/x_0$, the flow is not defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the vector field $X(x) = x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ is not complete.\n\n**3. Determination of the Supremum of Forward Times $T(x_0)$**\n\nThe problem defines $T(x_0)$ as the supremum of positive times $T$ such that the integral curve with initial condition $\\gamma_{x_0}(0)=x_0$ remains defined for all $t \\in [0, T)$.\n\nFrom the analysis above, the solution $x(t) = \\frac{x_0}{1 - x_0 t}$ is defined on the maximal interval $I_{x_0} = (-\\infty, 1/x_0)$. The set of non-negative times for which the solution is defined is $[0, 1/x_0)$. The question asks for the supremum of values $T$ such that $[0,T) \\subseteq [0, 1/x_0)$. The largest such value is clearly $1/x_0$.\n\nTherefore, the supremum of forward times is:\n$$\nT(x_0) = \\sup\\{T > 0 \\mid \\gamma_{x_0}(t) \\text{ is defined for all } t \\in [0,T)\\} = \\frac{1}{x_0}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{x_0}}\n$$", "id": "2980926"}]}
