If a given atlas is not oriented, we may attempt to make it so by \"flipping\" some of its charts. Flipping a chart $\\varphi_i$ corresponds to composing it with a diffeomorphism of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ having a negative Jacobian determinant, for example, $(u,v) \\mapsto (u,-v)$. Let $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$ be the sign of the determinant of this composition for each chart $\\varphi_i$. A choice of $\\{\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_3\\}$ defines a new atlas $\\{\\varphi'_i\\}$.\n\nThe transition map for the new atlas is $\\varphi'_j \\circ (\\varphi'_i)^{-1}$. The sign of its Jacobian determinant, $s'_{ji}$, is related to the original sign, $s_{ji}$, by the formula $s'_{ji} = \\epsilon_j \\cdot s_{ji} \\cdot \\epsilon_i$.\nIf the atlas $\\{\\,(U_{i},\\varphi_{i})\\,\\}_{i=1}^{3}$ could be refined to an oriented atlas, it would be possible to choose $\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_3$ such that all new transition maps have positive Jacobian determinants.

Their product would be $(+1)(+1)(+1) = +1$.\nHowever, we calculated $P = -1$.\nSo we have $s'_{21} s'_{32} s'_{13} = -1$, which contradicts the requirement that all factors must be $+1$. Therefore, it is impossible to choose orientations for the charts $\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2, \\varphi_3$ to make all transition maps have positive Jacobian determinants. This demonstrates that the manifold $M$ is non-orientable, as we have found a \"loop\" of charts that forces an orientation-reversing map.\nThe final answer is the numerical value of $P$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "2985564"}, {"introduction": "The orientability of many important manifolds, such as real projective spaces, is determined by the action of deck transformations on their covering spaces.

The sign of the determinant is $+1$ if the differential $\\mathrm{d}f_x: T_x M \\to T_y N$ is orientation-preserving, and $-1$ if it is orientation-reversing.\n\nThe map is the antipodal map $a: S^n \\to S^n$, defined by $a(x) = -x$. This map is a diffeomorphism, so every point $y \\in S^n$ is a regular value. For any $y \\in S^n$, the preimage set $a^{-1}(y)$ consists of the single point $x = -y$. Therefore, the sum for the degree collapses to a single term: the local degree at $x = -y$.\n$$ \\deg(a) = \\mathrm{sgn}(\\det(\\mathrm{d}a_{-y})) $$\nThe differential $\\mathrm{d}a_p: T_p S^n \\to T_{a(p)} S^n$ is the restriction of the differential of the linear map $A: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $A(x) = -x$, to the tangent space of the sphere. The differential of a linear map is the map itself, so $\\mathrm{d}a_p(v) = -v$ for any tangent vector $v \\in T_p S^n$. Note that $T_p S^n$ and $T_{-p} S^n$ are the same vector subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, namely $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid v \\cdot p = 0\\}$.\n\nThe orientation on $S^n$ is specified as that induced from its role as the boundary of the closed unit ball $B^{n+1}$, with the \"outward-normal-first\" convention. This means that for any point $p \\in S^n$, an ordered basis $(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ for the tangent space $T_p S^n$ is positively oriented if and only if the basis $(N_p, v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is positively oriented with respect to the standard orientation of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The outward unit normal vector $N_p$ at a point $p \\in S^n$ is the vector $p$ itself.

Carefully carry out the computation of $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\det(g_{01}))$ on each component of $U_{0} \\cap U_{1}$, identify the resulting locally constant function $c_{01}: U_{0} \\cap U_{1} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$, and determine the corresponding class in $H^{1}(M;\\mathbb{Z}/2)$.\n\n3.

No rounding is required, and no physical units apply.", "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed exercise in differential geometry, specifically concerning the first Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle of the Möbius band. All definitions and objects are standard in this field. The requested calculations are feasible and lead to a unique, well-defined result. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the three tasks in the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation of the First Stiefel-Whitney Class\n\nLet $E$ be a real vector bundle of rank $k$ over a manifold $M$, with projection map $p: E \\to M$. Let $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be a good open cover of $M$. For each open set $U_i$, there exists a local trivialization, which is a diffeomorphism $\\Psi_i: p^{-1}(U_i) \\to U_i \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$ that is linear on the fibers.\n\nOn any non-empty intersection of two such open sets, $U_{ij} = U_i \\cap U_j$, we can compose one trivialization with the inverse of another to get a map $\\Psi_i \\circ \\Psi_j^{-1}: U_{ij} \\times \\mathbb{R}^k \\to U_{ij} \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$. For any point $q \\in U_{ij}$, this map takes the form $(q, v) \\mapsto (q, g_{ij}(q)v)$, where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $g_{ij}(q)$ is an invertible linear transformation of $\\mathbb{R}^k$. This defines a family of transition functions $g_{ij}: U_{ij} \\to \\mathrm{GL}(k, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nOn a triple intersection $U_i \\cap U_j \\cap U_k$, the transition functions must satisfy the cocycle condition:\n$$ g_{ik}(q) = g_{ij}(q) g_{jk}(q) \\quad \\forall q \\in U_i \\cap U_j \\cap U_k $$\nThis follows from the identity $\\Psi_i \\circ \\Psi_k^{-1} = (\\Psi_i \\circ \\Psi_j^{-1}) \\circ (\\Psi_j \\circ \\Psi_k^{-1})$.\n\nThe bundle $E$ is orientable if its structure group can be reduced from $\\mathrm{GL}(k, \\mathbb{R})$ to its subgroup $\\mathrm{GL}^+(k, \\mathbb{R})$ of matrices with positive determinant. This is equivalent to the existence of a set of local trivializations whose transition functions all have positive determinants.\n\nThe obstruction to orientability is measured by the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(E) \\in H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$. We can represent this class using Čech cohomology. Let $\\sigma: \\mathrm{GL}(k, \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ be the group homomorphism given by the sign of the determinant, $\\sigma(A) = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\det(A))$. The group $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ with multiplication is isomorphic to the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}/2 = \\{0, 1\\}$ via the map that sends $1 \\mapsto 0$ and $-1 \\mapsto 1$.\n\nApplying $\\sigma$ to the transition functions gives a collection of locally constant functions $c_{ij} = \\sigma \\circ g_{ij}: U_{ij} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$. Let us verify that $\\{c_{ij}\\}$ defines a Čech $1$-cocycle. Applying $\\sigma$ to the cocycle condition for $g_{ij}$ and using the fact that $\\sigma$ is a homomorphism:\n$$ \\sigma(g_{ik}) = \\sigma(g_{ij} g_{jk}) = \\sigma(g_{ij}) \\sigma(g_{jk}) $$\nIn multiplicative notation for $\\{\\pm 1\\}$, this is $c_{ik} = c_{ij} c_{jk}$. In the additive notation of $\\mathbb{Z}/2$, this becomes:\n$$ c_{ik}(q) = c_{ij}(q) + c_{jk}(q) \\pmod 2 \\quad \\forall q \\in U_i \\cap U_j \\cap U_k $$\nThis is the Čech cocycle condition for a $1$-cocycle with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$. The set of functions $\\{c_{ij}\\}$ is thus an element of $C^1(\\{U_i\\}, \\mathbb{Z}/2)$.\n\nThe cohomology class $[c] \\in H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ of this cocycle is independent of the choice of local trivializations. If we choose a different set of trivializations $\\Psi'_i$, they are related to the original ones by maps $h_i: U_i \\to \\mathrm{GL}(k, \\mathbb{R})$, such that $\\Psi'_i(q, v) = (q, h_i(q) \\Psi_i(q,v))$. The new transition functions are $g'_{ij} = h_i g_{ij} h_j^{-1}$. The new cocycle is:\n$$ c'_{ij} = \\sigma(g'_{ij}) = \\sigma(h_i g_{ij} h_j^{-1}) = \\sigma(h_i) \\sigma(g_{ij}) \\sigma(h_j)^{-1} $$\nLetting $\\lambda_i = \\sigma(h_i): U_i \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$ be a Čech $0$-cochain, this relation in additive notation is:\n$$ c'_{ij} = \\lambda_i + c_{ij} - \\lambda_j = c_{ij} - (\\lambda_j - \\lambda_i) = c_{ij} - (\\delta\\lambda)_{ij} $$\nwhere $(\\delta\\lambda)_{ij} = \\lambda_j - \\lambda_i$ is the standard definition of the coboundary of a $0$-cochain. The cocycles $c'$ and $c$ differ by a coboundary (up to a sign, which is irrelevant in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$), and thus define the same cohomology class. The class is also independent of the choice of cover, a standard result in Čech theory.\n\nThis cohomology class $[c]$ is the first Stiefel-Whitney class, $w_1(E)$. The bundle $E$ is orientable if and only if $w_1(E) = 0$. This is because $w_1(E)=0$ means the cocycle $\\{c_{ij}\\}$ is a coboundary, i.e., $c_{ij} = \\lambda_j - \\lambda_i$ for some $0$-cochain $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$. This allows for a change of trivializations that makes all new transition functions have positive determinant.\n\n### Part 2: Explicit Calculation for the Möbius Band\n\nThe Möbius band $M$ is the quotient of the strip $S = [0,1] \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$ by the identification $(0,y) \\sim (1,-y)$. The tangent bundle is $TM$. We use the good cover specified: $U_0 = \\pi((0, 2/3) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon))$ and $U_1 = \\pi((1/3, 1) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon))$, where $\\pi: S \\to M$ is the quotient map.\n\nThe intersection $U_0 \\cap U_1$ has two path-connected components.\n1.  $V_A = \\pi((1/3, 2/3) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon))$. This is the \"central\" part of the band where the pre-images in the strip overlap directly.\n2.  $V_B$, which is the \"wrap-around\" component. This open set contains the seam of the Möbius band, which is the image of the identified lines $x=0$ and $x=1$. A point in $V_B$ is the image under $\\pi$ of a point in $(0, 1/3) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$ and also the image of a point in $(2/3, 1) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$ through the identification at the boundary.\n\nWe use the standard coordinates $(x,y)$ on the strip to define local frames for $TM$.\nOn $U_0$, we use the chart $\\phi_0: U_0 \\to (0, 2/3) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$, which is the inverse of $\\pi$ restricted to this domain. The local frame is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\}$.\nOn $U_1$, we use the chart $\\phi_1: U_1 \\to (1/3, 1) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$, with frame $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x'}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y'}\\}$.\n\nThe transition function for the tangent bundle, $g_{01}$, is the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate transformation $\\phi_0 \\circ \\phi_1^{-1}$.\n\nOn component $V_A$: A point $p \\in V_A$ can be represented by coordinates $(x,y)$ in $(1/3, 2/3) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$. We can choose the charts such that for $p \\in V_A$, $\\phi_0(p) = (x,y)$ and $\\phi_1(p) = (x',y') = (x,y)$. The coordinate transformation is the identity map. The Jacobian matrix is the identity matrix:\n$$ g_{01}|_{V_A} = J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(J) = 1$. The corresponding value of the cocycle is $c_{01}|_{V_A} = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nOn component $V_B$: A point $p \\in V_B$ has coordinates $(x,y)$ in the chart for $U_0$ and $(x',y')$ in the chart for $U_1$. Let's consider the coordinate transformation from the $U_1$ chart to the $U_0$ chart, $\\phi_0 \\circ \\phi_1^{-1}$.\nLet $(x',y')$ be coordinates for a point $p \\in V_B$ in the $U_1$ chart, so $(x',y') \\in (2/3, 1) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$. The point $p = \\pi(x',y')$.\nTo find its coordinates $(x,y)$ in the $U_0$ chart, we need to find the pre-image of $p$ within $(0, 2/3) \\times (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$. This requires relating coordinates across the identification seam $(0,y) \\sim (1,-y)$.\nA point with coordinate $x'$ close to $1$ is identified with a point with coordinate $x$ close to $0$. The transformation relating the coordinates across the seam is of the form $(x,y) = (x' - 1, -y')$.\nThe Jacobian of this coordinate transformation $(x',y') \\mapsto (x,y) = (x'-1, -y')$ is:\n$$ g_{01}|_{V_B} = J = \\frac{\\partial(x,y)}{\\partial(x',y')} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x'}  \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y'} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x'}  \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y'} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(J) = -1$. The corresponding value of the cocycle is $c_{01}|_{V_B} = 1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nSo, the cocycle $c_{01}: U_0 \\cap U_1 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$ is the locally constant function that is $0$ on $V_A$ and $1$ on $V_B$. This cocycle cannot be a coboundary. If it were, say $c_{01} = \\delta\\lambda$ for a 0-cochain $\\lambda = \\{\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1\\}$, then because the cover is good, $\\lambda_0$ and $\\lambda_1$ would be constant functions. This implies $\\delta\\lambda$ would be constant on all of $U_0 \\cap U_1$. Since $c_{01}$ takes two different values, it is not constant, which is a contradiction. Thus, the cohomology class $[c_{01}]$ is non-trivial. This signifies that the Möbius band is non-orientable. $[c_{01}]$ represents $w_1(TM)$.\n\n### Part 3: Evaluation on the Core Loop\n\nWe need to evaluate $w_1(TM)$ on the homology class $[\\gamma] \\in H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}/2)$, where $\\gamma:[0,1] \\to M$ is the core loop $\\gamma(t) = \\pi(t,0)$. The pairing between Čech cohomology and singular homology, $\\langle w_1(TM), [\\gamma] \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2$, can be computed by summing the values of the representing cocycle $c_{01}$ as the loop $\\gamma$ transitions between the sets of the cover $\\{U_0, U_1\\}$.\n\nLet's trace the path of the loop $\\gamma(t) = \\pi(t,0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ through the cover:\n- The loop starts at $\\gamma(0) = \\pi(0,0)$ in $U_0 \\setminus U_1$.\n- It enters the intersection $U_0 \\cap U_1$ in the component $V_A$, where $c_{01} = 0$.\n- It passes into $U_1 \\setminus U_0$.\n- To close the loop, it must pass back into $U_0 \\setminus U_1$. This happens at the identification seam, i.e., through the intersection component $V_B$, where $c_{01} = 1$.\n\nThe value of the pairing is the sum of the cocycle values over the transitions. The loop crosses from the domain of chart 0 to chart 1 through $V_A$ (cocycle value 0) and then crosses back from chart 1 to chart 0 through $V_B$ (cocycle value 1). The sum of these values is $0+1=1$.\n\nAlternatively, an interpretation of the pairing $w_1(TM)([\\gamma])$ is whether a frame transported along $\\gamma$ has its orientation flipped. Starting with a frame in $U_0$ and parallel transporting it along $\\gamma$, its orientation is preserved while passing through $V_A$. When it passes back into $U_0$ through $V_B$, the transition function has determinant $-1$, which flips the orientation of the frame. The frame comes back with the opposite orientation, which means the evaluation is the non-trivial element $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation of the first Stiefel-Whitney class on the homology class of the core circle is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2985567"}]}
