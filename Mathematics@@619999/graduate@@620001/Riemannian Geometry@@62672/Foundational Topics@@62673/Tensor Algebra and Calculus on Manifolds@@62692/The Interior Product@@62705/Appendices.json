Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed exercise in differential geometry. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe task is to compute $i_{\\partial_{x^{j}}}\\!\\left(dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}\\right)$.\n\nFirst, we use Property 1 to determine the action of $i_{\\partial_{x^{j}}}$ on a basis 1-form, $dx^{i}$. According to the definition, $i_{\\partial_{x^{j}}}(dx^{i})$ is the evaluation of the 1-form $dx^{i}$ on the vector field $\\partial_{x^{j}}$. By the fundamental relationship between coordinate differentials and coordinate vector fields, we have:\n$$\ni_{\\partial_{x^{j}}}(dx^{i}) = dx^{i}(\\partial_{x^{j}}) = \\delta^{i}_{j}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta^{i}_{j}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ if $i\\neq j$. The result is a $0$-form (a scalar function).\n\nNext, we use Property 2, the graded derivation rule, to find the action on the $k$-form $\\omega = dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}$. Let's denote the basis 1-forms as $\\alpha_{r} = dx^{i_{r}}$. The $k$-form is $\\omega = \\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k}$. We can derive a general formula for the action of $i_{X}$ on such a product by induction.\n\nFor $k=1$, we have $i_{X}(\\alpha_{1})$, which is the base case.\nFor $k=2$, we have a wedge product of two 1-forms. Since $\\alpha_{1}$ is a 1-form ($p=1$), the rule is:\n$$\ni_{X}(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\alpha_{2}) = (i_{X}\\alpha_{1})\\wedge\\alpha_{2} + (-1)^{1}\\alpha_{1}\\wedge(i_{X}\\alpha_{2}) = (i_{X}\\alpha_{1})\\alpha_{2} - (i_{X}\\alpha_{2})\\alpha_{1}\n$$\nHere we use the fact that $i_{X}\\alpha_{r}$ is a 0-form, and for a 0-form $f$ and a $q$-form $\\eta$, $f\\wedge\\eta = f\\eta$ and $\\eta\\wedge f = f\\eta$.\n\nLet's assume for a $(k-1)$-form that:\n$$\ni_{X}(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1}) = \\sum_{r=1}^{k-1}(-1)^{r-1}(i_{X}\\alpha_{r})(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{\\alpha_{r}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1})\n$$\nwhere the hat `^` denotes omission of the term. Now, for the $k$-form $\\omega = (\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1}) \\wedge \\alpha_{k}$:\n$$\ni_{X}(\\omega) = i_{X}((\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1}) \\wedge \\alpha_{k})\n$$\nLet $\\beta = \\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1}$, which is a $(k-1)$-form. Then $\\omega = \\beta \\wedge \\alpha_{k}$. Applying the graded derivation rule:\n$$\ni_{X}(\\beta \\wedge \\alpha_{k}) = (i_{X}\\beta)\\wedge\\alpha_{k} + (-1)^{k-1}\\beta\\wedge(i_{X}\\alpha_{k})\n$$\nSubstituting the inductive hypothesis for $i_{X}\\beta$:\n$$\ni_{X}(\\omega) = \\left( \\sum_{r=1}^{k-1}(-1)^{r-1}(i_{X}\\alpha_{r})(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{\\alpha_{r}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1}) \\right)\\wedge\\alpha_{k} + (-1)^{k-1}(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1})\\wedge(i_{X}\\alpha_{k})\n$$\nSince $i_{X}\\alpha_r$ and $i_X \\alpha_k$ are 0-forms, they can be factored out of the wedge products:\n$$\ni_{X}(\\omega) = \\sum_{r=1}^{k-1}(-1)^{r-1}(i_{X}\\alpha_{r})(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{\\alpha_{r}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1}\\wedge\\alpha_{k}) + (-1)^{k-1}(i_{X}\\alpha_{k})(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k-1})\n$$\nCombining these terms into a single sum from $r=1$ to $k$ gives the general formula:\n$$\ni_{X}(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k}) = \\sum_{r=1}^{k}(-1)^{r-1}(i_{X}\\alpha_{r})(\\alpha_{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{\\alpha_{r}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\alpha_{k})\n$$\nNow, we apply this formula to our specific problem where $X=\\partial_{x^{j}}$ and $\\alpha_{r}=dx^{i_{r}}$. Substituting $i_{\\partial_{x^{j}}}(dx^{i_{r}}) = \\delta^{i_{r}}_{j}$, we get:\n$$\ni_{\\partial_{x^{j}}}\\!\\left(dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}\\right) = \\sum_{r=1}^{k}(-1)^{r-1}\\delta^{i_{r}}_{j}\\left(dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i_{r}}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be analyzed in two cases:\n\n1.  **The index $j$ is not in the set $\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k}\\}$**.\n    In this scenario, $j \\neq i_{r}$ for all $r \\in \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$. Consequently, the Kronecker delta $\\delta^{i_{r}}_{j}$ is zero for every term in the summation. The entire sum is therefore zero.\n\n2.  **The index $j$ is in the set $\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k}\\}$**.\n    Since the indices $i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k}$ are given to be pairwise distinct, there exists a unique position $r_0 \\in \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ such that $i_{r_0} = j$. For all other positions $r \\neq r_0$, we have $i_{r} \\neq j$, and thus $\\delta^{i_{r}}_{j} = 0$. The sum reduces to a single surviving term, the one for $r=r_0$:\n    $$\n    (-1)^{r_0-1}\\delta^{i_{r_0}}_{j}\\left(dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i_{r_0}}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}\\right)\n    $$\n    Since $i_{r_0} = j$, $\\delta^{i_{r_0}}_{j} = 1$, and the expression becomes:\n    $$\n    (-1)^{r_0-1}\\left(dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i_{r_0}}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}\\right)\n    $$\n    The sign is determined by the position $r_0$ of the index $j$ in the ordered list $(i_1, \\ldots, i_k)$.\n\nThe summation formula elegantly combines these two cases into a single closed-form expression using the Kronecker delta, as required. To express the resulting wedge product formally, we can use the large wedge symbol $\\bigwedge$. The product $\\left(dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i_{r}}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}\\right)$ can be written as $\\left(\\bigwedge_{s=1}^{r-1} dx^{i_{s}}\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\bigwedge_{s=r+1}^{k} dx^{i_{s}}\\right)$, where an empty wedge product is defined as the multiplicative identity $1$. The final expression is the sum itself.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{r=1}^{k} (-1)^{r-1} \\delta^{i_{r}}_{j} \\left( \\left(\\bigwedge_{s=1}^{r-1} dx^{i_{s}}\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\bigwedge_{s=r+1}^{k} dx^{i_{s}}\\right) \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2999223"}, {"introduction": "With the foundational rules established, we can now explore the interior product in a concrete geometric setting.
