These curves are solutions to the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma_p(t) = X(\\gamma_p(t))$. A flow is \"global\" if it is defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe vector field $X=\\chi(x,y)\\big(-y\\,\\partial_{x}+x\\,\\partial_{y}\\big)$ is smooth and compactly supported on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Its support, $\\operatorname{supp}(X)$, is contained within the closed unit disk, $K = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x^2+y^2 \\le 1\\}$, since $\\chi(x,y)=0$ for $x^2+y^2 \\ge 1$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of ODEs states that any smooth vector field with compact support on a manifold is complete, i.e., it generates a global flow. A justification for this on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is that a compactly supported smooth vector field is bounded and globally Lipschitz. On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, any ODE defined by a globally Lipschitz vector field has a unique solution for any initial condition, defined for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $X$ admits a global flow $\\{\\Phi_t\\}_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}}$.\n\nFurthermore, for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus K$, we have $X_p = 0$. The unique solution to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = X(\\gamma(t))$ with initial condition $\\gamma(0)=p$ is the constant curve $\\gamma(t)=p$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\Phi_t(p)=p$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus K$ and all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means $\\Phi_t$ is the identity map, $\\operatorname{Id}$, on the set $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus K$. Consequently, its differential $d\\Phi_t$ is the identity on the tangent spaces $T_p\\mathbb{R}^2$ for $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus K$, and any induced map on tensor bundles, such as the pullback $(\\Phi_t)^*$ or the pushforward $(\\Phi_t)_*$, will also be the identity operator on fields supported in $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus K$. Thus, the flow is \"compactly supported\" in the specified sense, with the compact set being $K = \\operatorname{supp}(X)$.\n\n**(b) The Localization Property of the Lie Derivative**\n\nThe Lie derivative of a tensor field $S$ with respect to a vector field $X$ at a point $p$ is defined via the flow $\\Phi_t$ of $X$ as:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_X S)_p = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\Phi_t^*S)_p $$\nwhere $\\Phi_t^*$ denotes the pullback operator associated with the diffeomorphism $\\Phi_t$. For a covariant $2$-tensor such as $T$, the pullback is given by:\n$$ (\\Phi_t^*T)_p(v_1, v_2) = T_{\\Phi_t(p)}\\big( (d\\Phi_t)_p(v_1), (d\\Phi_t)_p(v_2) \\big) $$\nfor any tangent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in T_p M$.\n\nLet $U$ be an open neighborhood of $\\operatorname{supp}(T)$, and let $\\widetilde{X}$ be another smooth vector field such that $\\widetilde{X}|_U = X|_U$. Let $\\tilde{\\Phi}_t$ be the flow of $\\widetilde{X}$. We wish to show that $(\\mathcal{L}_{\\widetilde{X}}T)_p = (\\mathcal{L}_X T)_p$ for any $p \\in U$.\n\nThe value of $(\\mathcal{L}_X T)_p$ depends only on the behavior of the curve $t \\mapsto (\\Phi_t^*T)_p$ for $t$ in an arbitrarily small interval around $0$.\nLet's analyze the expression for $(\\Phi_t^*T)_p$. It depends on two things: the point $\\Phi_t(p)$ and the differential map $(d\\Phi_t)_p$.\n\n1.  If $p \\in U \\setminus \\operatorname{supp}(T)$, then $T_p=0$. Since $U \\setminus \\operatorname{supp}(T)$ is an open set, for sufficiently small $|t|$, the point $\\Phi_t(p)$ will remain in this set, so $T_{\\Phi_t(p)}=0$. This makes $(\\Phi_t^*T)_p=0$ for small $t$, and thus its time derivative at $t=0$ is zero. So $(\\mathcal{L}_X T)_p=0$. The same argument holds for $\\widetilde{X}$, so $(\\mathcal{L}_{\\widetilde{X}}T)_p=0$. The equality holds.\n\n2.  If $p \\in \\operatorname{supp}(T)$, then $p \\in U$ by assumption. The integral curves $\\gamma_X(t) = \\Phi_t(p)$ and $\\gamma_{\\widetilde{X}}(t) = \\tilde{\\Phi}_t(p)$ both start at $p$ and have the same initial velocity vector, since $\\dot{\\gamma}_X(0) = X_p = \\widetilde{X}_p = \\dot{\\gamma}_{\\widetilde{X}}(0)$. By the uniqueness of solutions to ODEs, for any point within an open set where two vector fields are identical, their integral curves starting at that point must also be identical for as long as they remain within that set. Thus, there exists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $\\Phi_t(p) = \\tilde{\\Phi}_t(p)$ for all $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$.\n\nFurthermore, the differential $(d\\Phi_t)_p$ is the Jacobian of the map $q \\mapsto \\Phi_t(q)$ evaluated at $p$. The map $\\Phi_t(q)$ for small $t$ depends on the values of $X$ in a neighborhood of $q$. Since $X = \\widetilde{X}$ on the whole neighborhood $U$ of $p$, their flows starting at any point in $U$ must agree for short times. This implies that their differentials also agree: $(d\\Phi_t)_p = (d\\tilde{\\Phi}_t)_p$ for $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$.\n\nCombining these facts, for any $p \\in \\operatorname{supp}(T) \\subset U$ and for $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$:\n$$ (\\Phi_t^*T)_p = T_{\\Phi_t(p)}\\big( (d\\Phi_t)_p(\\cdot), (d\\Phi_t)_p(\\cdot) \\big) = T_{\\tilde{\\Phi}_t(p)}\\big( (d\\tilde{\\Phi}_t)_p(\\cdot), (d\\tilde{\\Phi}_t)_p(\\cdot) \\big) = (\\tilde{\\Phi}_t^*T)_p $$\nSince the functions $t \\mapsto (\\Phi_t^*T)_p$ and $t \\mapsto (\\tilde{\\Phi}_t^*T)_p$ agree on an open interval containing $0$, their derivatives at $t=0$ must be equal. Therefore, $(\\mathcal{L}_X T)_p = (\\mathcal{L}_{\\widetilde{X}} T)_p$ for all $p \\in U$. This demonstrates that the Lie derivative is a local operator.\n\n**(c) Computation of the Scalar Value**\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\big(\\mathcal{L}_{X}T\\big)_{(0,0)}\\big(\\partial_{x},\\partial_{x}\\big)$.\nThe Lie derivative is a derivation on the algebra of tensor fields, so it obeys the Leibniz (product) rule. Let $S = dx\\otimes dy+dy\\otimes dx$. Then $T=\\chi S$.\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_X T = \\mathcal{L}_X (\\chi S) = (\\mathcal{L}_X \\chi) S + \\chi (\\mathcal{L}_X S) $$\nWe evaluate this expression at the origin $(0,0)$.\nFirst, we compute $(\\mathcal{L}_X \\chi)_{(0,0)}$. For a scalar function $f$, $\\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f)$.\nThe vector field is $X = \\chi(x,y)\\big(-y\\,\\partial_{x}+x\\,\\partial_{y}\\big)$. At the origin $(0,0)$, $x=0$ and $y=0$, so $X_{(0,0)} = \\chi(0,0)(0) = 0$.\nThus, $(\\mathcal{L}_X \\chi)_{(0,0)} = X_{(0,0)}(\\chi) = 0$.\nNext, we evaluate $\\chi(0,0)$. With $s=x^2+y^2=0$, we have $\\chi(0,0) = \\rho(0) = \\exp(-1/(1-0))\\exp(1) = e^{-1}e^1 = 1$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathcal{L}_X T$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_X T)_{(0,0)} = 0 \\cdot S_{(0,0)} + 1 \\cdot (\\mathcal{L}_X S)_{(0,0)} = (\\mathcal{L}_X(dx\\otimes dy+dy\\otimes dx))_{(0,0)} $$\nWe use the Leibniz rule for tensor products: $\\mathcal{L}_X(A \\otimes B) = (\\mathcal{L}_X A) \\otimes B + A \\otimes (\\mathcal{L}_X B)$.\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_X S = \\mathcal{L}_X(dx\\otimes dy) + \\mathcal{L}_X(dy\\otimes dx) = \\big((\\mathcal{L}_X dx) \\otimes dy + dx \\otimes (\\mathcal{L}_X dy)\\big) + \\big((\\mathcal{L}_X dy) \\otimes dx + dy \\otimes (\\mathcal{L}_X dx)\\big) $$\nTo compute $\\mathcal{L}_X dx$ and $\\mathcal{L}_X dy$, we use the fundamental property that the Lie derivative commutes with the exterior derivative ($d$): $\\mathcal{L}_X d = d \\mathcal{L}_X$.
