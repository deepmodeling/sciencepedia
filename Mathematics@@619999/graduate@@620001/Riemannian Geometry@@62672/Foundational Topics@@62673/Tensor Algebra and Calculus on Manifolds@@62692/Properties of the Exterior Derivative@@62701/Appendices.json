This first exercise provides a concrete anchor by connecting this property to a familiar result from multivariable calculus. By applying the exterior derivative twice to a function (a 0-form), you will demonstrate that the statement $d(df)=0$ is a direct and elegant reformulation of the equality of mixed partial derivatives, often known as Clairaut's theorem [@problem_id:1102267].", "problem": "In the theory of differential forms, the exterior derivative, denoted by $d$, is an operator that maps a differential $k$-form to a differential $(k+1)$-form. A fundamental property of the exterior derivative is its nilpotency, which states that applying the operator twice always results in zero. This is compactly written as $d^2 = 0$.

The operator $d^{2}$ means applying the exterior derivative twice, i.e., $d^{2}\\alpha = d(d\\alpha)$. From part 1, we found that $d\\alpha = 0$.

This result is consistent with the fundamental property $d^{2}=0$ for any differential form.\n\n**3. Closed and Exact Properties of $\\alpha$**\n\nA differential form $\\omega$ is defined as **closed** if its exterior derivative is zero, i.e., $d\\omega = 0$. From our computation in part 1, we have $d\\alpha=0$. Therefore, the form $\\alpha$ is **closed** on $M$.\n\nA differential form $\\omega$ is defined as **exact** on a manifold if there exists a form $\\eta$ of lower degree such that $\\omega = d\\eta$. For a $1$-form $\\alpha$, being exact means there exists a $0$-form (a smooth function) $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\alpha = df$.\n\nThe generalized Stokes' theorem states that for any smooth $k$-form $\\omega$ on a manifold $U$ and any $(k+1)$-dimensional submanifold-with-boundary $\\Omega \\subset U$, we have $\\int_{\\Omega} d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\omega$.\nIf $\\alpha$ were exact on $M$, we could write $\\alpha = df$ for some smooth function $f$ on $M$. Let $\\gamma$ be the unit circle, which is a $1$-dimensional closed submanifold of $M$. A closed manifold has no boundary, so $\\partial\\gamma = \\emptyset$. Applying Stokes' theorem (which in this case is the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals), we would have:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma} df = \\int_{\\partial\\gamma} f = 0\n$$\nThe integral over an empty boundary is zero. Thus, if $\\alpha$ is exact, its integral over any closed path must be zero. We will compute this integral in the next part. If the result is non-zero, we can conclude that $\\alpha$ is not exact.\n\n**4. Evaluation of the Line Integral $\\int_{\\gamma}\\alpha$**\n\nWe need to evaluate the line integral of $\\alpha$ along the positively oriented unit circle $\\gamma$, parameterized by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe components are $x(t) = \\cos t$ and $y(t) = \\sin t$.\nThe differentials are $dx = \\frac{dx}{dt}dt = -\\sin t \\, dt$ and $dy = \\frac{dy}{dt}dt = \\cos t \\, dt$.\n\nWe first compute the pullback of $\\alpha$ to the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ via the parameterization $\\gamma$. This is denoted $\\gamma^{*}\\alpha$. We substitute the expressions for $x$, $y$, $dx$, and $dy$ into $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\gamma^{*}\\alpha = \\frac{x(t)dy - y(t)dx}{x(t)^{2}+y(t)^{2}}\n$$\nThe denominator is $x(t)^{2}+y(t)^{2} = (\\cos t)^{2} + (\\sin t)^{2} = 1$.\nThe numerator is $x(t)dy - y(t)dx = (\\cos t)(\\cos t \\, dt) - (\\sin t)(-\\sin t \\, dt) = (\\cos^{2}t + \\sin^{2}t)dt = (1)dt = dt$.\nSo, the pullback form is simply $\\gamma^{*}\\alpha = dt$.\n\nThe line integral is then computed as:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma}\\alpha = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma^{*}\\alpha = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} dt = [t]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi\n$$\nThe value of the integral is $2\\pi$.\n\nReturning to the question in part 3, since $\\int_{\\gamma}\\alpha = 2\\pi \\neq 0$ for the closed path $\\gamma$, we conclude that the form $\\alpha$ is **not exact** on $M$. This is a classic example of a form that is closed but not exact.
