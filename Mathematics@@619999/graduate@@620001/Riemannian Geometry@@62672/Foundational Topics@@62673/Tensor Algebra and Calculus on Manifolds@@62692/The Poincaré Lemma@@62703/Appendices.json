We must first verify its closedness, then establish a criterion for exactness related to loop integrals, then compute a specific loop integral of $\\omega$, and finally synthesize these results to determine if $\\omega$ is exact on $M$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\omega$ is a closed form by computing its exterior derivative, $d\\omega$. The form $\\omega$ can be written as $\\omega = P(x, y)dx + Q(x, y)dy$, where $P(x, y) = \\dfrac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ and $Q(x, y) = \\dfrac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$.

Thus, we have verified that $\\omega$ is closed on $M$.\n\nSecond, we explain the relationship between exactness and integrals over closed loops. A $1$-form $\\alpha$ is defined as exact on a domain $D$ if there exists a smooth function $f: D \\to \\mathbb{R}$ (a $0$-form), called a potential function, such that $\\alpha = df$. Let $\\gamma: [a, b] \\to D$ be a continuously differentiable path in $D$. The integral of $\\alpha$ along $\\gamma$ is given by the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma} df = f(\\gamma(b)) - f(\\gamma(a))\n$$\nIf $\\gamma$ is a closed loop, its start and end points coincide, i.e., $\\gamma(a) = \\gamma(b)$. In this case, the value of the potential function at the start and end points must be the same, $f(\\gamma(a)) = f(\\gamma(b))$. Consequently, the integral of an exact form over any closed loop is zero:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = f(\\gamma(b)) - f(\\gamma(a)) = 0\n$$\nThis provides a necessary condition for a $1$-form to be exact: its integral along any closed loop in its domain must vanish.\n\nThird, we compute the integral of $\\omega$ along the positively oriented unit circle $S^{1}$, parameterized by $\\gamma: [0, 2\\pi] \\to M$ with $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t)$. We note that the image of $\\gamma$ is contained entirely in $M$, as the origin $(0,0)$ is not on the unit circle. To compute the integral $\\int_{\\gamma}\\omega$, we first find the pullback of $\\omega$ under $\\gamma$, denoted $\\gamma^{*}\\omega$.\nWe have $x(t) = \\cos t$ and $y(t) = \\sin t$. Their differentials with respect to $t$ are $dx = -\\sin t \\, dt$ and $dy = \\cos t \\, dt$. We substitute these into the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\gamma^{*}\\omega = \\frac{-y(t) \\cdot dx + x(t) \\cdot dy}{x(t)^{2} + y(t)^{2}} = \\frac{-(\\sin t)(-\\sin t \\, dt) + (\\cos t)(\\cos t \\, dt)}{(\\cos t)^{2} + (\\sin t)^{2}}\n$$\nThe denominator is the identity $\\cos^{2}t + \\sin^{2}t = 1$. The numerator simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\sin^{2}t + \\cos^{2}t)dt = 1 \\cdot dt = dt\n$$\nThus, the pullback is simply $\\gamma^{*}\\omega = dt$. Now, we can evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma}\\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma^{*}\\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} dt = [t]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi\n$$\n\nFinally, we conclude based on the preceding results. We have demonstrated that $\\omega$ is a closed form on $M$ ($d\\omega = 0$). We have also shown that a necessary condition for a $1$-form to be exact on a domain is that its integral over any closed loop within that domain must be zero. However, we have found a specific closed loop $\\gamma$ (the unit circle) in $M$ for which the integral of $\\omega$ is non-zero:\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma}\\omega = 2\\pi \\neq 0\n$$\nSince this integral does not vanish, the necessary condition for exactness is violated. Therefore, we must conclude that the $1$-form $\\omega$ is not exact on the domain $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$. This is a classic example illustrating that while every exact form is closed, a closed form is not necessarily exact if the domain is not simply connected (or, more generally, has trivial first de Rham cohomology).
