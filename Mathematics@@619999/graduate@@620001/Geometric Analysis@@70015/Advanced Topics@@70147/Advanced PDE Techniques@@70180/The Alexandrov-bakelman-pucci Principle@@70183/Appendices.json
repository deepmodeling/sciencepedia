It is set within the established theory of second-order partial differential equations. All terms ($L$, $f^{+}$, $f^{-}$) are defined using standard conventions. The problem is well-posed as a task of logical deduction from a set of premises. The language is precise and objective. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to evaluate the options without contradiction. The reference to the Alexandrov–Bakelman–Pucci principle serves as context but does not impose any unstated assumptions (like uniform ellipticity) on the operator $L$, which are necessary for the principle itself but not for evaluating the given statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n---\n\nThe solution requires evaluating each statement based on the provided inequality $L u(x) \\ge f(x)$ and the definitions of $f^{+}(x)$ and $f^{-}(x)$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThis option presents two identities: $f(x) = f^{+}(x) - f^{-}(x)$ and $|f(x)| = f^{+}(x) + f^{-}(x)$. These identities depend only on the definitions of the positive and negative parts of a function, not on the PDE. We verify them by cases.\n\nFor the first identity, $f(x) = f^{+}(x) - f^{-}(x)$:\n- If $f(x) \\ge 0$, then by definition, $f^{+}(x) = f(x)$ and $f^{-}(x) = \\max\\{-f(x), 0\\} = 0$. The identity becomes $f(x) = f(x) - 0$, which is true.\n- If $f(x) < 0$, then by definition, $f^{+}(x) = \\max\\{f(x), 0\\} = 0$ and $f^{-}(x) = \\max\\{-f(x), 0\\} = -f(x)$ (since $-f(x) > 0$). The identity becomes $f(x) = 0 - (-f(x))$, which is $f(x) = f(x)$, also true.\nThus, the first identity holds for all $x \\in \\Omega$.\n\nFor the second identity, $|f(x)| = f^{+}(x) + f^{-}(x)$:\n- If $f(x) \\ge 0$, then $|f(x)| = f(x)$. As established above, $f^{+}(x) = f(x)$ and $f^{-}(x) = 0$. The identity becomes $f(x) = f(x) + 0$, which is true.\n- If $f(x) < 0$, then $|f(x)| = -f(x)$. As established above, $f^{+}(x) = 0$ and $f^{-}(x) = -f(x)$. The identity becomes $-f(x) = 0 + (-f(x))$, which is true.\nThus, the second identity also holds for all $x \\in \\Omega$.\n\nSince both identities are universally true based on the definitions of $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$, statement A is necessarily true.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThe statement is that $-L u(x) \\le f^{-}(x)$ holds for every $x \\in \\Omega$.\nWe start with the given inequality:\n$$L u(x) \\ge f(x)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$-L u(x) \\le -f(x)$$\nBy definition, $f^{-}(x) = \\max\\{-f(x), 0\\}$. This directly implies that for any $x \\in \\Omega$, we have $-f(x) \\le f^{-}(x)$.\nCombining the two inequalities via the transitive property:\n$$-L u(x) \\le -f(x) \\le f^{-}(x)$$\nTherefore, $-L u(x) \\le f^{-}(x)$ is a necessary consequence of the given information.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThe statement is that $-L u(x) \\ge f^{+}(x)$ holds for every $x \\in \\Omega$. This is equivalent to $L u(x) \\le -f^{+}(x)$.\nWe are given $L u(x) \\ge f(x)$. For statement C to be necessarily true, we would need $f(x) \\le -f^{+}(x)$ to hold generally, which is not the case.\nConsider a counterexample. Let $n=1$, $\\Omega = (-1, 1)$. Let $u(x) = 1$ (a constant function). Then $\\partial_i u = 0$ and $\\partial_{ij} u = 0$.\nLet the operator be $L u = u$, so $a^{ij} = 0$, $b^i = 0$, $c = 1$.\nThen $L u(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$.\nLet $f(x) = 1/2$. The condition $L u(x) \\ge f(x)$ is satisfied, as $1 \\ge 1/2$.\nNow, let's check statement C.\n$f^{+}(x) = \\max\\{1/2, 0\\} = 1/2$.\nThe statement is $-L u(x) \\ge f^{+}(x)$, which translates to $-1 \\ge 1/2$. This is false.\nTherefore, statement C is not necessarily true.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThe statement is that if $u$ attains a strict interior maximum at $x_{0} \\in \\Omega$, then $f^{-}(x_0) = 0$. The condition $f^{-}(x_0) = 0$ is equivalent to $\\max\\{-f(x_0), 0\\} = 0$, which means $-f(x_0) \\le 0$, or $f(x_0) \\ge 0$.\nSo the statement claims that at a strict interior maximum $x_0$, we must have $f(x_0) \\ge 0$.\n\nAt a point $x_0$ of interior maximum, we have $\\partial_i u(x_0) = 0$ and the Hessian matrix $(\\partial_{ij} u(x_0))$ is negative semi-definite.\nThe operator at $x_0$ simplifies to $L u(x_0) = a^{ij}(x_0)\\,\\partial_{ij} u(x_0) + c(x_0)\\,u(x_0)$.\nThe problem statement does not impose any conditions on the coefficients beyond being measurable and $a^{ij}$ being symmetric. Specifically, there is no ellipticity condition (i.e., $(a^{ij})$ is not assumed to be positive definite) and no sign condition on $c(x)$. Without these conditions, the sign of $L u(x_0)$ is not determined.\n\nLet's construct a counterexample. Let $n=1$, $\\Omega = (-2, 2)$, and $u(x) = -x^2$. This function has a strict interior maximum at $x_0 = 0$.\nWe have $u'(x) = -2x$ and $u''(x) = -2$.\nLet the operator be $L u(x) = a(x) u''(x)$ with $a(x) = 1$. This is a valid operator according to the problem statement ($b=c=0$).\nThen $L u(x) = 1 \\cdot (-2) = -2$.\nLet $f(x) = -3$.\nThe inequality $L u(x) \\ge f(x)$ is satisfied, as $-2 \\ge -3$.\nAt the maximum point $x_0 = 0$, we have $f(x_0) = f(0) = -3$.\nFor this value, $f^{-}(x_0) = f^{-}(0) = \\max\\{-f(0), 0\\} = \\max\\{3, 0\\} = 3$.\nSince $f^{-}(x_0) = 3 \\ne 0$, we have found a case where all conditions are met but the conclusion of statement D is false.\nThus, statement D is not necessarily true. The conclusion of the classical maximum principle, which might suggest such a result, requires additional hypotheses (like ellipticity and a sign condition on $c$) not provided here.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\nThe statement is that \"$-L u \\le f^{-}$ and $L u \\ge -f^{-}$ are equivalent pointwise in $\\Omega$\".\nLet's analyze the two inequalities.\nThe first inequality is $-L u(x) \\le f^{-}(x)$.\nIf we multiply both sides of this inequality by $-1$, the inequality sign reverses, yielding:\n$$(-1)(-L u(x)) \\ge (-1)(f^{-}(x))$$\n$$L u(x) \\ge -f^{-}(x)$$\nThis is exactly the second inequality.\nConversely, if we start with the second inequality, $L u(x) \\ge -f^{-}(x)$, and multiply by $-1$, we recover the first inequality, $-L u(x) \\le f^{-}(x)$.\nTwo statements are equivalent if one can be derived from the other. Since each inequality is obtainable from the other by a single, reversible algebraic step (multiplication by $-1$), they are logically equivalent. This equivalence is a basic property of inequalities and does not depend on any other information from the problem. Thus, the statement that they are equivalent is necessarily true.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "3034124"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of the ABP principle lies a beautiful geometric argument that connects the geometry of a function's graph to the size of its domain.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet $\\Gamma(x) = \\varphi(|x|)$ be a convex function on $\\Omega = B_R(0)$.\nFirst, we analyze the implications of the given properties on the function $\\varphi: [0, R) \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\nFor $\\Gamma$ to be convex, the function $r \\mapsto \\varphi(r)$ must be convex and non-decreasing on $[0, R)$. The non-decreasing property arises because for any $x \\in \\Omega$, $\\Gamma(x) \\ge \\Gamma(0)$, which means $\\varphi(|x|) \\ge \\varphi(0)$. More generally, for $0 \\le r_1 < r_2 < R$, one can show that $\\varphi(r_1) \\le \\varphi(r_2)$. Since $\\varphi$ is non-decreasing, the supremum of $-\\varphi(r)$ is achieved at the smallest value of $r$, which is $r=0$.\nThus, the amplitude $M$ is given by\n$$ M = \\sup_{r \\in [0,R)} (-\\varphi(r)) = -\\varphi(0) $$\nThis implies $\\varphi(0) = -M$.\nThe boundary condition is $\\Gamma|_{\\partial \\Omega} \\le 0$, which means $\\varphi(R) := \\lim_{r \\to R^-} \\varphi(r) \\le 0$.\n\nThe gradient of $\\Gamma$ at a point $x \\neq 0$ is given by\n$$ \\nabla \\Gamma(x) = \\frac{d}{d|x|} \\varphi(|x|) \\frac{x}{|x|} = \\varphi'(|x|) \\frac{x}{|x|} $$\nwherever $\\varphi$ is differentiable. The magnitude of the gradient is therefore\n$$ |\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| = |\\varphi'(|x|)| $$\nSince $\\varphi$ is non-decreasing and convex, its derivative $\\varphi'(r)$ (where it exists) must be non-negative. Thus, $|\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| = \\varphi'(|x|)$.\nOur goal is to find an upper bound for $\\varphi'(r)$ for $r \\in (0,R)$.\n\nA fundamental property of a convex function $\\varphi$ on an interval $[a,b]$ states that for any $t_1, t_2, t_3$ with $a \\le t_1 < t_2 < t_3 \\le b$, the slopes of the secant lines are non-decreasing:\n$$ \\frac{\\varphi(t_2) - \\varphi(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1} \\le \\frac{\\varphi(t_3) - \\varphi(t_1)}{t_3 - t_1} \\le \\frac{\\varphi(t_3) - \\varphi(t_2)}{t_3 - t_2} $$\nFurthermore, if $\\varphi$ is differentiable at $t_2$, then\n$$ \\frac{\\varphi(t_2) - \\varphi(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1} \\le \\varphi'(t_2) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(t_3) - \\varphi(t_2)}{t_3 - t_2} $$\nApplying this property to $\\varphi$ on $[0,R]$, let $t_1=0$, $t_2=r \\in (0,R)$, and $t_3=R$. We get two key inequalities.\nFirst, for any $r \\in (0,R)$, the point $(r, \\varphi(r))$ lies below the secant line connecting $(0, \\varphi(0))$ and $(R, \\varphi(R))$:\n$$ \\varphi(r) \\le \\varphi(0) + \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)}{R} r $$\nSecond, for any $r \\in (0,R)$ where $\\varphi$ is differentiable, its derivative is bounded by the slope of the secant line from $(r,\\varphi(r))$ to $(R,\\varphi(R))$:\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(r)}{R - r} $$\nWe can combine these two inequalities to find a uniform bound on $\\varphi'(r)$.\nSubstitute the first inequality into the second one:\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(r)}{R-r} \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\left( \\varphi(0) + \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)}{R} r \\right)}{R-r} $$\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n$$ \\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0) - \\frac{r}{R}(\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) = (\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right) = (\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) \\frac{R-r}{R} $$\nSubstituting this back into the inequality for $\\varphi'(r)$:\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{(\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) \\frac{R-r}{R}}{R-r} = \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)}{R} $$\nThis provides a uniform upper bound for $\\varphi'(r)$ for all $r \\in (0,R)$ where the derivative exists.\nNow, we use the conditions $\\varphi(0) = -M$ and $\\varphi(R) \\le 0$.\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - (-M)}{R} = \\frac{\\varphi(R) + M}{R} $$\nSince $\\varphi(R) \\le 0$, we have $\\varphi(R) + M \\le M$.

Substituting this into our bound:\n$$ |\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| \\le \\frac{M}{\\frac{\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)}{2}} = 2 \\frac{M}{\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)} $$\nThis shows that the inequality holds for $C=2$. Therefore, the optimal constant must be less than or equal to $2$.\n\nTo show that $C=2$ is optimal, we must demonstrate that no smaller constant works for all functions in the class.

The Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) principle is a maximum principle that controls the positive part of $u$ in terms of boundary values and the negative part of $f$; it is commonly proved by introducing the concave envelope of $u^+$ and exploiting the properties of convex functions together with the area formula and Alexandrov’s theorem on twice differentiability of convex functions.\n\nFundamental facts to be used are:\n- The concave envelope $\\Gamma$ of a function $w$ on a convex set $K$ is the smallest concave function on $K$ that dominates $w$ on $K$.\n- If $\\Gamma$ is concave, then it is almost everywhere twice differentiable (Alexandrov’s theorem), $D^2 \\Gamma(x) \\le 0$ almost everywhere in the sense of symmetric matrices, and $\\nabla \\Gamma$ exists almost everywhere with a well-defined gradient image on measurable subsets.\n- The area formula for a differentiable mapping $F$ provides $\\int_E \\det(D F(x)) \\, dx = \\mathcal{L}^n(F(E))$ under appropriate regularity and injectivity conditions, and is used to relate measures of gradient images to integrals of determinants of Hessians of convex/concave envelopes.\n- A Whitney decomposition of $\\Omega$ (or of a closed subset of $\\Omega$) is a covering by cubes $\\{Q\\}$ with bounded overlap and sizes comparable to the distance to $\\partial \\Omega$, and can be chosen so that a fixed dilation $Q^\\ast$ of each cube $Q$ is convex and remains inside $\\Omega$.\n\nConsider the concave envelope argument used in ABP. Identify the correct statement(s) that explain why the convexity of $\\Omega$ is not required and how one can localize the concave envelope argument to convex subsets covering $\\Omega$, while rigorously relying only on the fundamental facts listed above.\n\nA. The convexity of $\\Omega$ is unnecessary because one can construct the concave envelope entirely within $\\Omega$ without any extension or modification; moreover, the upper contact set automatically splits along a Whitney covering of $\\Omega$ into pairwise disjoint pieces, so the area formula can be applied cube-by-cube without any overlap issues.\n\nB.

Convexity of $\\Omega$ is not required because the concave envelope can be constructed on a convex ambient set, such as the convex hull of $\\Omega$ or on convex dilations of Whitney cubes covering the positivity set of $u$.

While extending the function by zero to a larger convex domain (like $\\mathbb{R}^n$) is a valid step, the PDE is only satisfied within the original domain $\\Omega$. The argument must use this information, which is typically done by analyzing the contact set *inside* $\\Omega$. The claim that the contact set becomes all of $\\Omega$ is false.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:** This is **correct**. It accurately describes the standard, sophisticated technique used to generalize the proof. The strategy involves:\n1.  Covering the relevant part of the domain (e.g., where $u > 0$) with a Whitney decomposition, which consists of cubes $\\{Q\\}$ with bounded overlap.\n2.  Using the property that each cube $Q$ can be dilated to a slightly larger, *convex* set $Q^*$ that is still contained within $\\Omega$.\n3.  Localizing the argument to each convex set $Q^*$. This allows the construction of a concave envelope and the application of Alexandrov's theorem and the area formula on a valid (convex) domain.\n4.  Aggregating the local estimates derived from each cube. The bounded overlap property of the Whitney covering is essential to ensure that the sum of the local estimates remains controlled and provides a global bound.\n\nThis localization procedure successfully bypasses the non-convexity of $\\Omega$ by breaking the problem down into a collection of manageable problems on convex sets.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "3034117"}]}
