It is a standard result in classical potential theory.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe core of the argument is to show that the problem is invariant under scaling and translation, which reduces it to a fixed, normalized geometric setting.\n1.  Let $u$ be a positive harmonic function on $B_{2r}(x_0)$. This means $\\Delta u = 0$ in $B_{2r}(x_0)$.\n2.  We want to analyze the constant $C$ in $\\sup_{B_r(x_0)} u \\le C \\inf_{B_r(x_0)} u$.\n3.  Define a new function $v$ on the unit ball $B_2(0)$ by rescaling and translating $u$: Let $v(y) = u(x_0 + ry)$ for $y \\in B_2(0)$.\n4.  By the chain rule, if $\\Delta_x u(x) = 0$, then $\\Delta_y v(y) = r^2 (\\Delta_x u)(x_0+ry) = 0$. So, $v$ is a positive harmonic function on $B_2(0)$.\n5.  For this normalized setting, there exists a universal Harnack inequality: $\\sup_{B_1(0)} v \\le C(n) \\inf_{B_1(0)} v$. The constant $C(n)$ depends only on the dimension $n$ because the structure of the Laplacian operator and its fundamental solution (or Poisson kernel) are intrinsically dimension-dependent.\n6.  Now, we translate this result back to the original function $u$. By the definition of $v$:\n    *   $\\sup_{y \\in B_1(0)} v(y) = \\sup_{y \\in B_1(0)} u(x_0 + ry) = \\sup_{x \\in B_r(x_0)} u(x)$.\n    *   $\\inf_{y \\in B_1(0)} v(y) = \\inf_{y \\in B_1(0)} u(x_0 + ry) = \\inf_{x \\in B_r(x_0)} u(x)$.\n7.  Substituting these back into the inequality for $v$, we get $\\sup_{B_r(x_0)} u \\le C(n) \\inf_{B_r(x_0)} u$.\n8.  This shows that the constant $C$ is the same as the constant for the normalized problem on the unit ball, which depends only on the dimension $n$. It is independent of the center $x_0$, the radius $r$, and the specific positive harmonic function $u$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n*   **A:** Correct. The scaling argument demonstrates that the constant $C(n)$ depends only on the dimension $n$ and is independent of the ball's location ($x_0$), size ($r$), and the specific solution ($u$).\n*   **B:** Incorrect. The scaling argument explicitly shows that the inequality is invariant under changes in radius $r$. The constant does not depend on $r$.\n*   **C:** Incorrect. The constant is universal for the entire class of positive harmonic functions. It does not depend on the specific values of the function $u$.\n*   **D:** Incorrect. The behavior of harmonic functions is strongly dependent on dimension (e.g., the fundamental solution is $\\log|x|$ for $n=2$ but $|x|^{2-n}$ for $n>2$). Thus, the constant must depend on $n$.\n*   **E:** Incorrect. The inequality is homogeneous. If $u$ is a solution, so is $c \\cdot u$ for any $c>0$, and the constant $c$ cancels from both sides of the inequality.

Consider the following claims about scaling, intrinsic geometry, and the dependence of Harnack constants on $p$.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. Let $u>0$ be $p$-harmonic in $B_{r}(x_{0})$, and set $M := \\sup_{B_{r}(x_{0})} u$. Define $v(y) := u(x_{0} + r y)/M$ on $B_{1}$. Then $v$ is $p$-harmonic in $B_{1}$, satisfies $\\sup_{B_{1}} v = 1$, and any elliptic Harnack inequality on $B_{1/2}$ holds with a constant depending only on $n$ and $p$, not on $r$ or $M$.\n\nB. If one imposes the intrinsic energy normalization $\\int_{B_{1}} |\\nabla v|^{p} \\, dy = 1$ on $B_{1}$ in addition to $\\sup_{B_{1}} v = 1$, then the Harnack constant for $v$ on $B_{1/2}$ becomes independent of $p$.\n\nC. Under the spatial scaling $v(y) := u(x_{0} + r y)$, the scale-invariant energy satisfies $E_{v}(0,1) = E_{u}(x_{0},r)$. Moreover, multiplying $u$ by a constant $c>0$ sends $E_{u}(x_{0},r)$ to $c^{p} E_{u}(x_{0},r)$.\n\nD. In order to obtain a truly scale-invariant Harnack inequality for positive $p$-harmonic functions, one must measure balls in an intrinsic path metric that depends on $|\\nabla u|$ (for example, by integrating a weight built from $|\\nabla u|$ along curves), because otherwise the Harnack constants inevitably depend on the amplitude of $u$.\n\nE. For positive weak solutions of the $p$-Laplace equation, after rescaling to the unit ball and normalizing by the oscillation or an equivalent energy level, the Harnack inequality holds with a constant that is uniform in the radius and amplitude of $u$, but generally deteriorates as $p \\to 1^{+}$ or $p \\to \\infty$.", "solution": "**Derivation of Scaling Properties**\nLet $u$ be a $p$-harmonic function in $B_R(x_0)$. We analyze two types of scaling.\n1.  **Spatial Scaling:** Let $v(y) = u(x_0 + Ry)$. We check if $v$ is $p$-harmonic in $B_1$. For a test function $\\psi \\in C_c^\\infty(B_1)$, let $\\varphi(x) = \\psi((x-x_0)/R)$. Then $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(B_R(x_0))$, $\\nabla_y v = R \\nabla_x u$, and $\\nabla_y \\psi = R \\nabla_x \\varphi$. The weak formulation for $v$ is:\n    $$ \\int_{B_1} |\\nabla_y v|^{p-2} \\nabla_y v \\cdot \\nabla_y \\psi \\, dy = \\int_{B_R} |R\\nabla_x u|^{p-2} (R\\nabla_x u) \\cdot (R\\nabla_x \\varphi) (R^{-n} dx) $$\n    $$ = R^{p-1+1-n} \\int_{B_R} |\\nabla_x u|^{p-2} \\nabla_x u \\cdot \\nabla_x \\varphi \\, dx = 0 $$\n    So, spatial scaling preserves the property of being $p$-harmonic.\n2.  **Amplitude Scaling:** Let $w(x) = c \\cdot u(x)$ for a constant $c>0$. $\\nabla w = c \\nabla u$. The weak formulation for $w$ is:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla w|^{p-2} \\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi \\, dx = \\int_{\\Omega} |c\\nabla u|^{p-2} (c\\nabla u) \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi \\, dx = c^{p-1} \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u|^{p-2} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi \\, dx = 0 $$\n    So, multiplying by a constant also preserves the property of being $p$-harmonic.\nThese two scaling properties combined show that if $u$ is $p$-harmonic, then $v(y) = (u(x_0+Ry))/M$ is also $p$-harmonic. This normalization allows one to prove estimates on a canonical domain ($B_1$) for a normalized function ($\\sup v = 1$), with constants that depend only on the intrinsic parameters $n$ and $p$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n*   **A:** Correct. As shown in the derivation, the function $v(y) = u(x_0 + ry)/M$ is indeed $p$-harmonic in $B_1$. By construction, $\\sup_{B_1} v = \\frac{1}{M}\\sup_{B_r} u = 1$. The Harnack inequality for such a normalized $p$-harmonic function on a fixed domain ($B_{1/2} \\subset B_1$) depends only on the equation's structural parameters, which are the dimension $n$ and the exponent $p$. This scaling argument is precisely how one shows the Harnack constant is independent of the radius $r$ and amplitude $M$.\n*   **B:** Incorrect. The structure of the $p$-Laplace equation, and thus the behavior of its solutions, depends fundamentally on $p$. This dependence does not vanish upon normalization. The constants in all regularity estimates for $p$-harmonic functions, including the Harnack constant, depend on $p$ and typically degenerate as $p \\to 1^+$ or $p \\to \\infty$. Imposing an energy normalization fixes the solution within a class for a given $p$, but does not make the estimates uniform across different $p$.\n*   **C:** Correct. Let's verify the two claims. First, for $v(y) = u(x_0+ry)$, using the change of variables $x=x_0+ry$, we have $dx=r^n dy$ and $\\nabla_y v = r\\nabla_x u$.\n    $$ E_v(0,1) = 1^{p-n} \\int_{B_1} |\\nabla_y v|^p dy = \\int_{B_1} |r \\nabla_x u|^p dy = r^p \\int_{B_r} |\\nabla_x u|^p (r^{-n} dx) = r^{p-n} \\int_{B_r} |\\nabla u|^p dx = E_u(x_0, r). $$\n    Second, for $\\tilde{u}=cu$, we have $\\nabla\\tilde{u} = c\\nabla u$.\n    $$ E_{\\tilde{u}}(x_0,r) = r^{p-n} \\int_{B_r} |\\nabla \\tilde{u}|^p dx = r^{p-n} \\int_{B_r} |c\\nabla u|^p dx = c^p \\left( r^{p-n} \\int_{B_r} |\\nabla u|^p dx \\right) = c^p E_u(x_0,r). $$\n    Both calculations are correct.\n*   **D:** Incorrect. The justification is false. As shown in option A, a standard Euclidean scaling is sufficient to obtain a Harnack constant that is independent of the solution's amplitude. While intrinsic metrics are a powerful tool in the study of degenerate equations, they are not necessary to achieve amplitude-invariance for the Harnack constant.\n*   **E:** Correct. This statement accurately summarizes the state of the art. The scaling argument (as in option A) confirms that the constant can be made independent of radius and amplitude.

It is a valid and insightful problem.\n\n**Derivation (Scaling Analysis)**\nThe key to understanding the different behaviors is the scaling property of the drift term's norm. Let $u(x)$ be a solution on $B_2$. Define a rescaled solution $u_r(x) = u(rx)$ for $r \\in (0,1]$. A direct calculation shows that $u_r$ solves a similar equation but with a rescaled drift $b_r(x) = r \\, b(rx)$. The $L^p$ norm of this new drift over a fixed ball, say $B_1$, is calculated by a change of variables ($y=rx$):\n$$ \\|b_r\\|_{L^p(B_1)}^p = \\int_{B_1} |r \\, b(rx)|^p \\, dx = r^p \\int_{B_1} |b(rx)|^p \\, dx = r^p \\int_{B_r} |b(y)|^p \\, r^{-n} dy = r^{p-n} \\|b\\|_{L^p(B_r)}^p. $$\nThus, $\\|b_r\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = r^{1-n/p} \\|b\\|_{L^p(B_r)}$.\nThis scaling has two regimes:\n1.  **Critical Case ($p=n$):** The exponent is $1-n/n = 0$. The norm $\\|b_r\\|_{L^n(B_1)} = \\|b\\|_{L^n(B_r)}$ is scale-invariant. Any smallness condition on the norm cannot be achieved by rescaling to a smaller domain.\n2.  **Subcritical Case ($p>n$):** The exponent $1-n/p$ is positive. As $r \\to 0$, $\\|b_r\\|_{L^p(B_1)} \\to 0$. This means that on a small enough scale, the drift term becomes arbitrarily small in the $L^p$ norm.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n*   **A:** Correct. For divergence-form equations of the type $\\operatorname{div}(A\\nabla u + bu)=0$, the theory (an extension of De Giorgi-Nash-Moser methods) shows that the Harnack inequality holds provided the drift $b$ is in $L^n$. This is the critical space identified by scaling. Crucially, due to the equation's special structure, no smallness assumption on the size of $\\|b\\|_{L^n}$ is needed. The constant simply depends on this norm.\n*   **B:** Incorrect. For non-divergence form equations, the theory (based on the ABP maximum principle) is perturbative. It can only handle small drift terms. Since the $L^n$ norm is scale-invariant, a general drift $b \\in L^n$ cannot be made small by rescaling. Therefore, a smallness condition on $\\|b\\|_{L^n}$ is required, and the statement is false as it claims no smallness is needed.\n*   **C:** Correct. This accurately describes the situation for non-divergence form equations. If $p>n$, the problem is subcritical. By scaling down ($r \\to 0$), the $L^p$ norm of the drift can be made arbitrarily small, satisfying the requirements of the perturbative theory. Therefore, a Harnack inequality holds for any $b \\in L^p$ with $p>n$. The statement correctly identifies $p=n$ as the critical case where an additional smallness assumption is generally necessary.\n*   **D:** Correct. The calculation and the conclusion about the scaling behavior are accurate, as shown in the derivation above. This scaling is the fundamental mathematical reason for the distinction between the $p=n$ and $p>n$ regimes.\n*   **E:** Incorrect. This contradicts statement A. In the divergence form case, the Harnack inequality holds for $b \\in L^n$, which implies that weak solutions are locally bounded.
