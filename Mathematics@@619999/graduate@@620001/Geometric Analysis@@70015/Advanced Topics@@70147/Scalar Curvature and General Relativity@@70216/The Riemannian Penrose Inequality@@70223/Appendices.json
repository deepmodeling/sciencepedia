The metric provided is the spatial part of the Schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates, a fundamental object in general relativity. The definition of ADM mass is standard. All components of the problem are well-defined and self-contained. The problem is objective and formalizable. The calculation is non-trivial but feasible, requiring a direct application of the provided definition. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to compute the ADM mass by directly evaluating the given integral expression. The calculation will be performed assuming the standard Einstein summation convention for repeated indices.\n\nLet's begin by computing the terms in the integrand, $\\partial_{j} g_{ij} - \\partial_{i} g_{jj}$.\n\nFirst, we find the trace of the metric, $g_{jj} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} g_{jj}$.\nSince $g_{ij} = u^4 \\delta_{ij}$, the metric components are $g_{11} = g_{22} = g_{33} = u^4$ and $g_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\nThus, the trace is:\n$$\ng_{jj} = g_{11} + g_{22} + g_{33} = u^4 + u^4 + u^4 = 3u^4\n$$\nNow, we compute the partial derivative of the trace, $\\partial_i g_{jj}$:\n$$\n\\partial_i g_{jj} = \\partial_i (3u^4) = 12u^3 \\partial_i u\n$$\nwhere $\\partial_i u \\equiv \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^i}$.\n\nNext, we compute the divergence-like term, $\\partial_j g_{ij} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\partial_j g_{ij}$.\nFor a fixed index $i$, since $g_{ij}$ is diagonal, the sum over $j$ has only one non-zero term, which occurs when $j=i$:\n$$\n\\partial_j g_{ij} = \\partial_i g_{ii}\n$$\nAs $g_{ii} = u^4$ (no sum over $i$), we have:\n$$\n\\partial_j g_{ij} = \\partial_i (u^4) = 4u^3 \\partial_i u\n$$\n\nTo proceed, we need the partial derivative of the function $u(r) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2r}$, where $r = |x| = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2}$.\nUsing the chain rule, $\\partial_i u = \\frac{du}{dr} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x^i}$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2}r^{-1}\\right) = -\\frac{m}{2}r^{-2} = -\\frac{m}{2r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^3 (x^k)^2\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2r} (2x^i) = \\frac{x^i}{r}\n$$\nCombining these, we get:\n$$\n\\partial_i u = \\left(-\\frac{m}{2r^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x^i}{r}\\right) = -\\frac{mx^i}{2r^3}\n$$\n\nNow we substitute these expressions back into the integrand vector $V^i = \\partial_{j} g_{ij} - \\partial_{i} g_{jj}$:\n$$\nV^i = 4u^3 \\partial_i u - 12u^3 \\partial_i u = -8u^3 \\partial_i u\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\partial_i u$:\n$$\nV^i = -8u^3 \\left(-\\frac{mx^i}{2r^3}\\right) = \\frac{4mu^3 x^i}{r^3}\n$$\n\nThe ADM mass definition involves the surface integral of the contraction $V^i \\nu^i$ over the sphere $S_R$. The outward unit normal vector $\\nu^i$ on the sphere $S_R$ (where $r=R$) with respect to the Euclidean metric is given by $\\nu^i = \\frac{x^i}{R}$. We compute the contraction:\n$$\nV^i \\nu^i = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\left(\\frac{4mu^3 x^i}{r^3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x^i}{R}\\right) = \\frac{4mu^3}{r^3 R} \\sum_{i=1}^3 (x^i)^2\n$$\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^3 (x^i)^2 = r^2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nV^i \\nu^i = \\frac{4mu^3}{r^3 R} r^2 = \\frac{4mu^3}{rR}\n$$\nWe need to evaluate this expression on the surface of integration $S_R$, so we set $r=R$:\n$$\n\\left. V^i \\nu^i \\right|_{r=R} = \\frac{4m u(R)^3}{R^2}\n$$\nSubstituting $u(R) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2R}$:\n$$\n\\left. V^i \\nu^i \\right|_{r=R} = \\frac{4m}{R^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2R}\\right)^3\n$$\nThis expression is a function of $R$ only and is constant over the sphere $S_R$. Therefore, the surface integral is this constant value multiplied by the Euclidean area of the sphere, which is $4\\pi R^2$.\n$$\n\\int_{S_R} (V^i \\nu^i) dS = \\left( \\frac{4m}{R^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2R}\\right)^3 \\right) \\times (\\text{Area of } S_R) = \\left( \\frac{4m}{R^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2R}\\right)^3 \\right) (4\\pi R^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{S_R} (V^i \\nu^i) dS = 16\\pi m \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2R}\\right)^3\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the definition for the ADM mass and take the limit as $R \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(g) = \\frac{1}{16\\pi} \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\left[ 16\\pi m \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2R}\\right)^3 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(g) = m \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2R}\\right)^3\n$$\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{m}{2R} \\to 0$.

A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe mean curvature of a hypersurface transforms in a specific way under a conformal change of the ambient metric. Let $(M, g_0)$ be a Riemannian manifold of dimension $N$, and let $\\Sigma$ be a hypersurface of dimension $N-1$. Let $g = \\Omega^2 g_0$ be a conformally related metric. The mean curvature $H_g$ of $\\Sigma$ with respect to the metric $g$ is related to its mean curvature $H_{g_0}$ with respect to $g_0$ by the formula:\n$$\nH_g = \\Omega^{-1} H_{g_0} + \\frac{N-1}{\\Omega^2} \\frac{\\partial \\Omega}{\\partial \\nu_0}\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_0$ is the unit normal vector to $\\Sigma$ in the metric $g_0$.\n\nIn our problem, the ambient manifold is $3$-dimensional, so $N=3$. The base metric is the Euclidean metric, $g_0 = \\delta$. The new metric is $g = u^4 \\delta$. Comparing this with $g = \\Omega^2 g_0$, we identify the conformal factor $\\Omega = u^2$. The hypersurface $\\Sigma$ is the coordinate sphere $S_r$, which has dimension $N-1 = 2$.\n\nThe formula for the mean curvature $H_g(r)$ of $S_r$ is therefore:\n$$\nH_g(r) = (u^2)^{-1} H_{\\delta}(r) + \\frac{2}{(u^2)^2} \\frac{\\partial (u^2)}{\\partial \\nu_{\\delta}}\n$$\n\nWe must now compute the terms on the right-hand side.\n\n1.  **Mean curvature $H_{\\delta}(r)$**:\n    The surface $S_r$ is a sphere of radius $r$ in $3$-dimensional Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^3, \\delta)$.

The first term is\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{|S_{r}|_{g}}{16\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi r^{2} u(r)^{4}}{16\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{r^{2} u(r)^{4}}{4}} = \\frac{r u(r)^{2}}{2}.\n$$\nThe second term in the parenthesis is\n$$\n\\frac{H^{2} |S_{r}|_{g}}{16\\pi} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2}{r u(r)^{3}} \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{2r}\\right) \\right)^{2} \\left( 4\\pi r^{2} u(r)^{4} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{4\\pi r^{2} u(r)^{4}}{16\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{4}{r^{2} u(r)^{6}} \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{u(r)^{4}}{u(r)^{6}} \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}}{u(r)^{2}}.\n$$\nSubstituting $u(r) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2r}$, this becomes\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}}.\n$$\nNow we evaluate the full parenthetical expression from the Hawking mass formula:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{H^{2} |S_{r}|_{g}}{16\\pi} = 1 - \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2} - \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}}.\n$$\nThe numerator is a difference of squares $(a+b)(a-b)$ or can be expanded directly:\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{r} + \\frac{m^{2}}{4r^{2}}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{r} + \\frac{m^{2}}{4r^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{2m}{r}.\n$$\nSo, the parenthetical expression is\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{2m}{r}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{2m}{r u(r)^{2}}.\n$$\nFinally, we assemble the Hawking mass by multiplying the two computed factors:\n$$\nm_{H}(S_{r}) = \\left(\\frac{r u(r)^{2}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2m}{r u(r)^{2}}\\right) = m.\n$$\nThe result $m_{H}(S_{r}) = m$ shows that the Hawking mass of any coordinate sphere $S_r$ is constant and equal to the parameter $m$. This calculation explicitly demonstrates that $m_{H}(S_{r})$ is independent of the radius $r$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{m}\n$$", "id": "3036610"}]}
