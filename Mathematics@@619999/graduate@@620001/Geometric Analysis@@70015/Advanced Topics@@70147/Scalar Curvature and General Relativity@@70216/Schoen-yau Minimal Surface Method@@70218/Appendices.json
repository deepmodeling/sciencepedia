Express your final answer for $H$ as a single exact value. No rounding is required and there are no physical units to report.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in differential geometry with a clearly defined objective and no internal contradictions or missing information. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the mean curvature scalar $H$ of the unit sphere $S^m$ embedded in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$. The given definitions are:\n$S^m = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1} : |x| = 1 \\}$.\nThe shape operator of a hypersurface $\\Sigma^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ with unit normal field $\\nu$ is $S(X) = D_X \\nu$ for a tangent vector $X$, where $D$ is the Euclidean covariant derivative.\nThe mean curvature scalar is $H = \\frac{1}{m} \\operatorname{tr}(S)$.\n\nFirst, we must specify the unit normal vector field $\\nu$ for the sphere $S^m$. The sphere is an oriented manifold. For a sphere centered at the origin, two canonical choices for the unit normal field exist at any point $x \\in S^m$: the outward-pointing normal vector $\\nu(x) = x$ and the inward-pointing normal vector $\\nu(x) = -x$. The choice of normal determines the sign of the mean curvature scalar $H$. A standard convention for a hypersurface that forms the boundary of a compact region (in this case, the unit ball) is to use the outward-pointing normal. We adopt this convention and set $\\nu(x) = x$. Note that $|x|=1$ for all $x \\in S^m$, so this is indeed a unit normal field.\n\nThe tangent space to $S^m$ at a point $x$ is the set of vectors orthogonal to the normal vector at that point: $T_x S^m = \\{ v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1} : \\langle v, x \\rangle = 0 \\}$.\n\nNext, we compute the shape operator $S: T_x S^m \\to T_x S^m$. Per the problem's definition, $S(X) = D_X \\nu$ for any $X \\in T_x S^m$. In Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, the covariant derivative $D_X V$ of a vector field $V$ in the direction of a vector $X$ is simply the directional derivative, which can be computed as $\\nabla_X V = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{V(p+tX) - V(p)}{t}$.\nAlternatively, if we have a curve $\\gamma(t)$ on the manifold with $\\gamma(0) = x$ and $\\gamma'(0) = X$, then $D_X \\nu = \\left. \\frac{d}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} \\nu(\\gamma(t))$.\nWe have chosen the normal field $\\nu(p) = p$ for any point $p \\in S^m$. So, $\\nu(\\gamma(t)) = \\gamma(t)$.\nThe calculation of the shape operator is therefore:\n$$ S(X) = D_X \\nu = \\left. \\frac{d}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} \\nu(\\gamma(t)) = \\left. \\frac{d}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} \\gamma(t) = \\gamma'(0) = X $$\nThis shows that for any tangent vector $X \\in T_x S^m$, we have $S(X) = X$. Thus, the shape operator $S$ for the unit sphere (with the outward normal) is the identity map on each tangent space: $S_x = \\mathrm{Id}_{T_x S^m}$.\n\nThe mean curvature scalar $H$ is defined as $H = \\frac{1}{m} \\operatorname{tr}(S)$. The trace of a linear operator is the sum of its eigenvalues, or equivalently, the sum of the diagonal entries of its matrix representation in any basis. Let's choose an orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_m\\}$ for the tangent space $T_x S^m$. The matrix representation of $S$ in this basis has entries $[S]_{ij} = \\langle S(e_j), e_i \\rangle$.\nSince $S(e_j) = e_j$, the entries are:\n$$ [S]_{ij} = \\langle e_j, e_i \\rangle = \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The matrix of $S$ is the $m \\times m$ identity matrix, $I_m$.\nThe trace of the identity matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$ \\operatorname{tr}(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^m [S]_{ii} = \\sum_{i=1}^m 1 = m $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the formula for the mean curvature scalar:\n$$ H = \\frac{1}{m} \\operatorname{tr}(S) = \\frac{m}{m} = 1 $$\nThe mean curvature scalar of the unit sphere $S^m$ is $H=1$. This value is a non-zero constant, confirming that $S^m$ is a constant-mean-curvature (CMC) hypersurface but is not a minimal surface (a surface is minimal if and only if $H=0$).

Therefore, we can conclude that the operators are equal:\n$$\nLu = \\Delta u + \\big( |A|^{2} + \\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu) \\big) u\n$$\nThis gives the action of the operator $L$. The operator itself is:\n$$\nL = \\Delta + |A|^{2} + \\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu) \\quad (5)\n$$\n\nThe next step is to compute the term $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu)$ for the ambient space $M^{3}_{c}$, a $3$-manifold of constant sectional curvature $c$. The Ricci tensor at a point $p \\in M$ is defined by $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(V,W) = \\operatorname{tr}(Y \\mapsto R(Y,V)W)$. For an orthonormal basis $\\{E_1, E_2, E_3\\}$ of the tangent space $T_p M$, this is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(V,W) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\langle R(E_i,V)W, E_i \\rangle$. We want to compute $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu)$. Let us choose a specific orthonormal basis adapted to the surface $\\Sigma$ at a point $p \\in \\Sigma$: let $\\{E_1, E_2\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p\\Sigma$, and let $E_3 = \\nu(p)$ be the unit normal vector. With this basis $\\{E_1, E_2, \\nu\\}$, we have:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu) = \\langle R(E_1,\\nu)\\nu, E_1 \\rangle + \\langle R(E_2,\\nu)\\nu, E_2 \\rangle + \\langle R(\\nu,\\nu)\\nu, \\nu \\rangle\n$$\nThe last term is zero because the Riemann tensor is antisymmetric in its first two arguments, so $R(\\nu,\\nu)\\nu = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu) = \\langle R(E_1,\\nu)\\nu, E_1 \\rangle + \\langle R(E_2,\\nu)\\nu, E_2 \\rangle\n$$\nWe are given the formula for the Riemann curvature tensor of a space form:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = c \\big( \\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y \\big)\n$$\nLet's apply this to the first term.

So,\n$$\nR(E_1,\\nu)\\nu = c(1 \\cdot E_1 - 0 \\cdot \\nu) = cE_1\n$$\nTaking the inner product with $E_1$:\n$$\n\\langle R(E_1,\\nu)\\nu, E_1 \\rangle = \\langle cE_1, E_1 \\rangle = c \\langle E_1,E_1 \\rangle = c\n$$\nThe calculation for the second term is identical:\n$$\n\\langle R(E_2,\\nu)\\nu, E_2 \\rangle = c\n$$\nTherefore, the Ricci curvature in the normal direction is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu) = c + c = 2c \\quad (6)\n$$\n\nNow we substitute this result $(6)$ back into our expression for the operator $L$ in equation $(5)$:\n$$\nL = \\Delta + |A|^{2} + 2c\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the Jacobi operator $L$.\n\nThe dependence of the formula on the constant sectional curvature $c$ of the ambient space arises entirely from the Ricci curvature term $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu,\\nu)$. This term measures the curvature of the ambient space in planes containing the normal vector $\\nu$. Specifically, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu, \\nu)$ is the sum of the sectional curvatures of $M^{3}_{c}$ over an orthonormal basis of planes containing $\\nu$. In a space of constant sectional curvature $c$, any $2$-plane has sectional curvature $c$. The Ricci curvature $\\operatorname{Ric}_{M}(\\nu, \\nu)$ equals the sum of sectional curvatures $K_M(E_1, \\nu) + K_M(E_2, \\nu)$, where $\\{E_1, E_2\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $T_p\\Sigma$. Since $K_M(E_1, \\nu) = K_M(E_2, \\nu) = c$, their sum is $2c$. This geometric quantity $2c$ contributes as an additive potential term to the operator. If $c>0$ (e.g., $M = S^3$), this term has a destabilizing effect. If $c<0$ (e.g., $M = \\mathbb{H}^3$), this term has a stabilizing effect. If $c=0$ (e.g., $M=\\mathbb{R}^3$), this term vanishes, and the operator reduces to the classical stability operator $L = \\Delta + |A|^2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\Delta + |A|^{2} + 2c } $$", "id": "3033334"}, {"introduction": "To transform the stability condition into powerful geometric theorems, the Schoen-Yau method employs sophisticated analytical tools, chief among them the Green's function.
