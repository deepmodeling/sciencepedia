It is scientifically grounded in standard Riemannian geometry, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and no contradictions. The problem can be solved using established principles of differential geometry.\n\nThe solution will proceed in three main steps. First, we will establish the scalar curvature of the standard $n$-sphere of radius $1$. Second, we will derive the transformation law for scalar curvature under a homothetic scaling of the metric. Third, we will apply this law to the standard sphere metric to find the scalar curvature for a sphere of general radius $r$.\n\nThe problem states that $S^n$ for $n \\ge 2$ is realized as the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, equipped with the metric $g_1$ induced by the standard Euclidean inner product. This manifold, $(S^n, g_1)$, is a classic example of a space form. It is a maximally symmetric space with constant positive sectional curvature. It is a well-established fact from the geometry of submanifolds that the sectional curvature of $S^n(1) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is constant and equal to $K=+1$.\n\nWe begin by computing the scalar curvature of $(S^n, g_1)$ from this fundamental property.\nLet $g_1$ denote the standard round metric on the unit sphere $S^n$. The sectional curvature $K_{g_1}$ for any $2$-plane $\\sigma$ in any tangent space $T_p S^n$ is constant, $K_{g_1}(\\sigma) = 1$.\n\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}$, is defined by its action on tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p S^n$. If we choose an orthonormal basis $\\{E_1, \\dots, E_n\\}$ for $T_p S^n$, the component $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j)$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^n R_{g_1}(E_k, E_i, E_k, E_j)\n$$\nwhere $R_{g_1}$ is the $(0,4)$-Riemann tensor. For a space of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann tensor has a specific form:\n$$\nR_{g_1}(X,Y,Z,W) = K (g_1(X,W)g_1(Y,Z) - g_1(X,Z)g_1(Y,W))\n$$\nSetting $K=1$, we find the Ricci tensor components:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (g_1(E_k,E_j)g_1(E_i,E_k) - g_1(E_k,E_k)g_1(E_i,E_j))\n$$\nSince $\\{E_k\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g_1(E_a, E_b) = \\delta_{ab}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (\\delta_{kj}\\delta_{ik} - \\delta_{kk}\\delta_{ij}) = \\delta_{ij} - n \\delta_{ij} = (1-n)\\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThis calculation is slightly incorrect. Let's re-evaluate using the definition of Ricci curvature as a trace of the curvature operator. A more direct route is to relate Ricci curvature to sectional curvatures. For a unit vector $X \\in T_p S^n$, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(X,X)$ is the sum of sectional curvatures of all planes containing $X$. Let $\\{E_1, \\dots, E_n\\}$ be an orthonormal basis with $E_1=X$. Then\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(X,X) = \\sum_{j=2}^n K_{g_1}(\\mathrm{span}\\{E_1, E_j\\}) = \\sum_{j=2}^n 1 = n-1\n$$\nSince this holds for any unit vector $X$, the Ricci tensor must be proportional to the metric:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1} = (n-1)g_1\n$$\nThe scalar curvature, $S_{g_1}$, is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric $g_1$. Using our orthonormal basis $\\{E_i\\}$:\n$$\nS_{g_1} = \\mathrm{tr}_{g_1}(\\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{g_1}(E_i, E_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (n-1) = n(n-1)\n$$\nSince $n \\ge 2$, $S_{g_1} = n(n-1) > 0$. Thus, $(S^n, g_1)$ indeed has positive scalar curvature.\n\nNext, we derive the transformation law for scalar curvature under the homothetic scaling $g \\mapsto \\tilde{g} = c g$ for a constant $c>0$.\nLet $\\nabla$ and $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ be the Levi-Civita connections of $g$ and $\\tilde{g}$ respectively. The connection is determined by the Koszul formula. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$:\n$$\n2 \\tilde{g}(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = X(\\tilde{g}(Y,Z)) + Y(\\tilde{g}(X,Z)) - Z(\\tilde{g}(X,Y)) + \\tilde{g}([X,Y],Z) - \\tilde{g}([X,Z],Y) - \\tilde{g}([Y,Z],X)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tilde{g}=cg$ and using that $c$ is a constant:\n$$\n2c g(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = c \\left( X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y],Z) - g([X,Z],Y) - g([Y,Z],X) \\right)\n$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is $2g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)$. Therefore,\n$$\n2c g(\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y, Z) = 2c g(\\nabla_X Y, Z)\n$$\nwhich implies $\\tilde{\\nabla}_X Y = \\nabla_X Y$ for all $X, Y$. The Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant scaling of the metric.\n\nNow we examine the Riemann curvature tensor, which is defined in its $(1,3)$-form as $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$. Since the connection is invariant, the $(1,3)$-tensor is also invariant:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Z = \\tilde{\\nabla}_X \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y Z - \\tilde{\\nabla}_Y \\tilde{\\nabla}_X Z - \\tilde{\\nabla}_{[X,Y]}Z = R(X,Y)Z\n$$\nThe Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}$ is the trace of the curvature operator. Let $\\{E_i\\}$ be a $g$-orthonormal basis. Then $\\{\\tilde{E}_i = E_i / \\sqrt{c}\\}$ forms a $\\tilde{g}$-orthonormal basis. The Ricci tensor (as a bilinear form) is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde{g}(\\tilde{R}(X, \\tilde{E}_i)Y, \\tilde{E}_i)\n$$\nUsing $\\tilde{R}=R$ and $\\tilde{g}=cg$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c g(R(X, E_i/\\sqrt{c})Y, E_i/\\sqrt{c}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c \\frac{1}{c} g(R(X, E_i)Y, E_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(R(X, E_i)Y, E_i) = \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(X,Y)\n$$\nThus, the Ricci tensor, as a $(0,2)$-tensor, is also invariant under constant metric scaling: $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}} = \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar curvature $S_{\\tilde{g}}$, which is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to its metric $\\tilde{g}$.\n$$\nS_{\\tilde{g}} = \\mathrm{tr}_{\\tilde{g}}(\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{\\tilde{g}}(\\tilde{E}_i, \\tilde{E}_i)\n$$\nUsing the invariance of the Ricci tensor and the definition of $\\tilde{E}_i$:\n$$\nS_{\\tilde{g}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(\\frac{E_i}{\\sqrt{c}}, \\frac{E_i}{\\sqrt{c}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{c} \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(E_i, E_i) = \\frac{1}{c} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Ric}_{g}(E_i, E_i)\n$$\nThe sum on the right is the scalar curvature $S_g$. So, we arrive at the scaling law:\n$$\nS_{\\tilde{g}} = \\frac{1}{c} S_g\n$$\nThe problem specifies the family of metrics $g_r = r^2 g_1$. This corresponds to the scaling factor $c=r^2$. Applying the derived law:\n$$\nS_{g_r} = \\frac{1}{r^2} S_{g_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the value $S_{g_1} = n(n-1)$:\n$$\nS_{g_r} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}\n$$\nFor any choice of $r>0$, since $n \\ge 2$, the scalar curvature $S_{g_r}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the family $(S^n, g_r)$ for $r>0$ provides an explicit construction of metrics with positive scalar curvature on $S^n$.\n\nAs a brief contextual remark related to the Gromov-Lawson surgery theorem, this family of metrics is fundamental. When performing surgery on a manifold, one excises a region and glues in a new piece. The \"neck\" of this surgery region is topologically $S^{k} \\times S^{n-k-1} \\times [0,1]$. A key step in the proof of the surgery theorem is to show that if one starts with a positive scalar curvature (PSC) metric, the new manifold after surgery also admits a PSC metric (provided the surgery codimension is at least $3$). This is accomplished by carefully constructing a metric on the neck region modeled on a cylinder $S^{n-1} \\times I$. The metric on the cross-sectional sphere $S^{n-1}$ can be chosen from the family $(S^{n-1}, g_r)$. The positive scalar curvature of these spheres, $S_{g_r} = (n-1)(n-2)/r^2$, is essential. By making the radius $r$ of the neck very small, the contribution of the cross-sectional curvature becomes large and positive, which can be used to dominate any negative curvature contributions that might arise from gluing, ultimately allowing for the construction of a new, global PSC metric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}}$$", "id": "3035445"}, {"introduction": "While the Gromov-Lawson theorem is a powerful tool for constructing PSC metrics, it is equally important to understand when such metrics *cannot* exist.

In dimension $n=2m$, the complex spinor bundle $\\mathbb{S}$ splits into positive and negative chirality subbundles, $\\mathbb{S} = \\mathbb{S}^+ \\oplus \\mathbb{S}^-$. The Dirac operator $D$ anticommutes with the chirality operator and decomposes into $D = D^+ \\oplus D^-$, where $D^+: \\Gamma(\\mathbb{S}^+) \\to \\Gamma(\\mathbb{S}^-)$ and $D^-: \\Gamma(\\mathbb{S}^-) \\to \\Gamma(\\mathbb{S}^+)$. The index is defined as $\\mathrm{ind}(D) = \\dim(\\ker D^+) - \\dim(\\ker D^-)$. The problem statement identifies this index with $\\hat{A}(M)$.\n\nA spinor field $\\psi \\in \\Gamma(\\mathbb{S})$ is called a harmonic spinor if it is in the kernel of the Dirac operator, i.e., $D\\psi = 0$. If $\\psi$ is a harmonic spinor, then it is also in the kernel of the square of the Dirac operator, $D^2\\psi = D(D\\psi) = D(0) = 0$.\n\nWe now apply the given Lichnerowicz formula: $D^2\\psi = \\nabla^*\\nabla\\psi + \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Scal}_g\\,\\psi$. For a harmonic spinor $\\psi$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla^*\\nabla\\psi + \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Scal}_g\\,\\psi = 0\n$$\nWe take the $L^2$-inner product of this equation with $\\psi$ itself and integrate over the closed manifold $M$. The inner product is taken pointwise in the fibers of the spinor bundle, and the integration is performed with respect to the volume form $d\\mathrm{vol}_g$ induced by the metric $g$.\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\left\\langle \\nabla^*\\nabla\\psi + \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Scal}_g\\,\\psi, \\psi \\right\\rangle \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g = 0\n$$\nBy linearity of the integral and the inner product, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\langle \\nabla^*\\nabla\\psi, \\psi \\rangle \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g + \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{M} \\langle \\mathrm{Scal}_g\\,\\psi, \\psi \\rangle \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g = 0\n$$\nThe operator $\\nabla^*$ is the formal adjoint of the spin connection $\\nabla$. Since $M$ is a closed manifold (compact and without boundary), we can use integration by parts (Green's identity):\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\langle \\nabla^*\\nabla\\psi, \\psi \\rangle \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\int_{M} \\langle \\nabla\\psi, \\nabla\\psi \\rangle \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\int_{M} |\\nabla\\psi|^2 \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g\n$$\nThe scalar curvature $\\mathrm{Scal}_g$ acts by pointwise multiplication, so $\\langle \\mathrm{Scal}_g\\,\\psi, \\psi \\rangle = \\mathrm{Scal}_g \\langle \\psi, \\psi \\rangle = \\mathrm{Scal}_g |\\psi|^2$.

Thus, the integrand $\\mathrm{Scal}_g |\\psi|^2$ is non-negative, and the integral must also be greater than or equal to $0$.\n\nThe sum of two non-negative quantities can be zero if and only if both quantities are zero. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n\\int_{M} |\\nabla\\psi|^2 \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_{M} \\mathrm{Scal}_g |\\psi|^2 \\, d\\mathrm{vol}_g = 0\n$$\nFrom the second equation, since the integrand $\\mathrm{Scal}_g |\\psi|^2$ is continuous and non-negative, the integral can be zero only if the integrand is identically zero everywhere on $M$. Given the strict positivity of the scalar curvature, $\\mathrm{Scal}_g > 0$, we must conclude that $|\\psi|^2 = 0$ everywhere on $M$. This implies that the spinor field $\\psi$ must be the zero spinor, $\\psi = 0$.\n\nThis demonstrates that under the assumption of a positive scalar curvature metric, the only harmonic spinor is the zero spinor. In other words, the kernel of the Dirac operator is trivial: $\\ker D = \\{0\\}$.\nSince $\\ker D = \\ker D^+ \\oplus \\ker D^-$, it follows that both $\\ker D^+$ and $\\ker D^-$ are trivial.\nTherefore, $\\dim(\\ker D^+) = 0$ and $\\dim(\\ker D^-) = 0$.\nThe index of the Dirac operator is then $\\mathrm{ind}(D) = \\dim(\\ker D^+) - \\dim(\\ker D^-) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nBy the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, $\\hat{A}(M) = \\mathrm{ind}(D)$. Thus, we have shown that if $M$ admits a metric with $\\mathrm{Scal}_g > 0$, then $\\hat{A}(M)=0$. This completes the first task.\n\nFor the second task, we are asked to compute the $\\hat{A}$-genus for the complex $K3$ surface, and discuss the implications for the existence of a positive scalar curvature metric on it. The $K3$ surface is a closed, simply connected, spin $4$-manifold. We are given the Betti numbers for its intersection form on $H^2(K3;\\mathbb{Z})$: $b_2^+=3$ and $b_2^-=19$.\n\nFirst, we compute the signature of $K3$, denoted $\\sigma(K3)$. The signature is defined as the difference between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the intersection form matrix. These numbers are given by $b_2^+$ and $b_2^-$.\n$$\n\\sigma(K3) = b_2^+ - b_2^- = 3 - 19 = -16\n$$\nNext, we use the provided Hirzebruch signature theorem identity for $4$-manifolds to find the value of the first Pontryagin class evaluated on the fundamental class $[K3]$:\n$$\n\\langle p_{1}(TM),[K3]\\rangle = 3\\,\\sigma(K3) = 3 \\times (-16) = -48\n$$\nNow, we use the provided identity for the $\\hat{A}$-genus of a $4$-manifold:\n$$\n\\hat{A}(K3) = -\\frac{1}{24}\\langle p_{1}(TM),[K3]\\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the value we just computed:\n$$\n\\hat{A}(K3) = -\\frac{1}{24} \\times (-48) = 2\n$$\nSo, the $\\hat{A}$-genus of the $K3$ surface is $2$.\n\nThe implication of this result follows directly from the proof in the first task. We established that any closed spin manifold admitting a metric of strictly positive scalar curvature must have an $\\hat{A}$-genus of zero.\nOur calculation shows that for the $K3$ surface, $\\hat{A}(K3) = 2$, which is non-zero.\nTherefore, the necessary condition for the existence of a positive scalar curvature metric is violated. We conclude that the $K3$ surface cannot admit any Riemannian metric with strictly positive scalar curvature. The non-vanishing of the $\\hat{A}$-genus serves as a topological obstruction to the existence of such a metric.

In our orthonormal frame, this is the sum of the diagonal components:\n$R_g = \\mathrm{Ric}_g(\\partial_r, \\partial_r) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\mathrm{Ric}_g(E_i, E_i)$.\nSubstituting the expressions for the components:\n$R_g = -(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{n-2}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} \\right)$.\n$R_g = -(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + (n-1)\\left( \\frac{n-2}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} \\right)$.\n$R_g = -2(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(r)^2} - \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(r)^2}(f'(r))^2$.\nUsing the given scalar curvature of the sphere $R_h = (n-1)(n-2)$, we obtain the formula:\n$R_g = -2(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-1)(n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} + \\frac{R_h}{f(r)^2}$.\nThis derivation confirms the formula provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Solving the Differential Equation**\n\nThe problem asks for a function $f(r)$ that yields a constant scalar curvature $R_g = c > 0$. Thus, we set the expression for $R_g$ equal to $c$:\n$-2(n-1)\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} - (n-1)(n-2)\\frac{(f'(r))^2}{f(r)^2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(r)^2} = c$.\n\nThis is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for $f(r)$. To solve it, we first rearrange the terms. Multiplying by $f(r)^2$ and dividing by $n-1$:\n$-2f(r)f''(r) - (n-2)(f'(r))^2 + (n-2) = \\frac{c}{n-1}f(r)^2$.\n$2f(r)f''(r) + (n-2)(f'(r))^2 = (n-2) - \\frac{c}{n-1}f(r)^2$.\n\nThis is an autonomous equation since $r$ does not appear explicitly. We use the standard substitution $p(f) = f'(r)$, which implies $f''(r) = \\frac{dp}{dr} = \\frac{dp}{df}\\frac{df}{dr} = p\\frac{dp}{df}$.\nSubstituting into the equation gives:\n$2fp\\frac{dp}{df} + (n-2)p^2 = (n-2) - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^2$.\nLet $u(f) = p^2 = (f')^2$. Then $\\frac{du}{df} = 2p\\frac{dp}{df}$. The equation becomes a first-order linear ODE for $u(f)$:\n$f\\frac{du}{df} + (n-2)u = (n-2) - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^2$.\nDividing by $f$:\n$\\frac{du}{df} + \\frac{n-2}{f}u = \\frac{n-2}{f} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f$.\n\nWe solve this using an integrating factor $I(f)$:\n$I(f) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{n-2}{f} df\\right) = \\exp((n-2)\\ln f) = f^{n-2}$.\nMultiplying the ODE by $I(f)$:\n$f^{n-2}\\frac{du}{df} + (n-2)f^{n-3}u = (n-2)f^{n-3} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^{n-1}$.\nThe left side is the derivative of the product $I(f)u(f)$:\n$\\frac{d}{df}(f^{n-2}u) = (n-2)f^{n-3} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^{n-1}$.\nIntegrating with respect to $f$ (valid for $n \\ge 3$):\n$f^{n-2}u = \\int \\left((n-2)f^{n-3} - \\frac{c}{n-1}f^{n-1}\\right) df = f^{n-2} - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f^n + C_1$, where $C_1$ is an integration constant.\nSolving for $u$:\n$u(f) = 1 - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f^2 + C_1 f^{-(n-2)}$.\n\nRecalling that $u = (f')^2$, we have:\n$(f'(r))^2 = 1 - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f(r)^2 + C_1 f(r)^{-(n-2)}$.\nWe use the initial conditions $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$ to determine $C_1$. As $r \\to 0$, we have $f(r) \\approx f'(0)r = r$.\nThe left side of the equation approaches $(f'(0))^2 = 1^2 = 1$. On the right side, the first two terms approach $1-0=1$. The term $C_1 f(r)^{-(n-2)}$ behaves like $C_1 r^{-(n-2)}$. Since $n \\ge 3$, the exponent $-(n-2)$ is less than or equal to $-1$. If $C_1 \\neq 0$, this term would diverge as $r \\to 0$. To maintain the equality, we must have $C_1 = 0$.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$(f'(r))^2 = 1 - \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}f(r)^2$.\nLet $k^2 = \\frac{c}{n(n-1)}$. Since $c>0$ and $n \\ge 3$, $k$ is a positive real constant: $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{n(n-1)}}$.\nThe ODE is $(f')^2 = 1 - k^2 f^2$.\nTaking the square root gives $f'(r) = \\pm\\sqrt{1 - k^2 f(r)^2}$. From the initial condition $f'(0)=1 > 0$, we must choose the positive root for $r$ near $0$. By continuity, we take the positive root for all $r \\in (0,L)$.\n$\\frac{df}{dr} = \\sqrt{1 - k^2 f^2}$.\nThis is a separable equation:\n$\\frac{df}{\\sqrt{1 - k^2 f^2}} = dr$.\nIntegrating both sides from $0$ to $r$:\n$\\int_0^{f(r)} \\frac{d\\tilde{f}}{\\sqrt{1 - k^2 \\tilde{f}^2}} = \\int_0^r d\\tilde{r}$.\nThe left integral is $\\left[\\frac{1}{k}\\arcsin(k\\tilde{f})\\right]_0^{f(r)} = \\frac{1}{k}\\arcsin(kf(r))$. The right integral is $r$.\n$\\frac{1}{k}\\arcsin(kf(r)) = r$.\nSolving for $f(r)$:\n$\\arcsin(kf(r)) = kr$\n$kf(r) = \\sin(kr)$\n$f(r) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sin(kr)$.\n\nSubstituting back the expression for $k$:\n$f(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{n(n-1)}{c}} \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{n(n-1)}} r\\right)$.\n\nThis is the closed-form solution for the warping function $f(r)$ that satisfies the given conditions. Let us verify the initial conditions:\n$f(0) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sin(0) = 0$.\n$f'(r) = \\frac{1}{k} \\cos(kr) \\cdot k = \\cos(kr)$, so $f'(0) = \\cos(0) = 1$.\nBoth conditions are satisfied.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{n(n-1)}{c}} \\sin\\left(r\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{n(n-1)}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3035418"}]}
