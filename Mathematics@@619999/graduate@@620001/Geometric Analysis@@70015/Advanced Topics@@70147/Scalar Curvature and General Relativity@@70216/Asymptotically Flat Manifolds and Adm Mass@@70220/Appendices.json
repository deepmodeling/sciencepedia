Since $h$ is smooth, its partial derivatives of all orders are also smooth functions with support contained within the same compact set.\nTherefore, the components $V^i$ of the vector field $V$, being linear combinations of first derivatives of the components of $h$, are also smooth and compactly supported within the ball $B_{R_0}$ of radius $R_0$.\n\nWe need to evaluate the limit of the flux integral $I(r)$ as $r \\to \\infty$.
