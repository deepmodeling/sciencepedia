On the dense open set $S^{4} \\setminus \\{\\infty\\}$, we have $A = \\pi^{*} A_{\\mathrm{E}}$. The curvature of a pullback connection is the pullback of the original curvature. Thus, the curvature $F_{A}$ of the connection $A$ is given by:\n$$F_{A} = \\pi^{*} F_{\\mathrm{E}}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to use the conformal invariance of the Hodge star operator on $2$-forms in four dimensions. Let $(M, g)$ be a $4$-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold. If we consider a conformally related metric $g' = \\phi^{2} g$ for some positive function $\\phi$, the Hodge star operator $*_{g'}$ acting on $2$-forms is identical to $*_{g}$. This can be seen from the general transformation law for the Hodge star on $p$-forms in dimension $n$, which is $*_{g'} = \\phi^{n-2p} *_{g}$. For our case, $n=4$ and $p=2$, so the exponent $n-2p = 4 - 2(2) = 0$, which confirms $*_{g'} = *_{g}$.\n\nThe metric $g_{S}$ on $S^{4}$ is related to the Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{E}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ via the conformal map $\\pi$. Specifically, on $S^{4} \\setminus \\{\\infty\\}$, we have $g_{S} = \\Omega^{2} \\pi^{*} g_{\\mathrm{E}}$, where $\\pi^{*} g_{\\mathrm{E}}$ is the pullback of the Euclidean metric to $S^{4} \\setminus \\{\\infty\\}$. Applying the conformal invariance property with $g' = g_{S}$ and $g = \\pi^{*} g_{\\mathrm{E}}$, we find that the Hodge star operator $*_{g_{S}}$ is identical to the Hodge star operator $*_{\\pi^{*} g_{\\mathrm{E}}}$ when acting on $2$-forms on $S^{4} \\setminus \\{\\infty\\}$:\n$$*_{g_{S}} = *_{\\pi^{*} g_{\\mathrm{E}}}$$\n\nNext, we relate the Hodge star on $S^{4} \\setminus \\{\\infty\\}$ with the pulled-back metric, $*_{\\pi^{*} g_{\\mathrm{E}}}$, to the Hodge star on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$, $*_{g_{\\mathrm{E}}}$.

Since the connection $A$ and its curvature $F_{A}$ are defined to extend smoothly over the point at infinity, this first-order differential relation holds on all of $S^{4}$ by continuity. Thus, the curvature $F_{A}$ is Anti-Self-Dual on $\\left(S^{4}, g_{S}\\right)$.\n\n(b) Derivation and computation of the Yang-Mills energy.\n\nThe Yang-Mills energy of the connection $A$ is given by the integral:\n$$E(A) = \\int_{S^{4}} |F_{A}|^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g_{S}}$$\nThe problem provides the identity relating the pointwise norm of the curvature to a wedge product:\n$$|F_{A}|^{2} \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g_{S}} = - \\operatorname{tr}\\!\\left(F_{A} \\wedge *_{g_{S}} F_{A}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the energy functional, we get:\n$$E(A) = - \\int_{S^{4}} \\operatorname{tr}\\!\\left(F_{A} \\wedge *_{g_{S}} F_{A}\\right)$$\nFrom part (a), we established that for the standard instanton connection, the curvature is Anti-Self-Dual, i.e., $*_{g_{S}} F_{A} = -F_{A}$.

This is the space of $k \\times k$ complex matrices. As a complex vector space, its dimension is $k^2$.

Each term in this expression is a Hermitian endomorphism on $V$.

The sum of Hermitian operators is Hermitian. Thus, $\\mu_{\\mathbb{R}}$ takes values in the space of Hermitian endomorphisms of $V$, which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{u}(V)$ of the unitary group $U(V)$. The real dimension of the space of $k \\times k$ Hermitian matrices is $k^2$ (there are $k$ real diagonal entries and $\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ complex entries above the diagonal, contributing $k + 2 \\cdot \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = k^2$ real degrees of freedom).

The dimension to be subtracted is the dimension of the orbit of a generic point. The problem states to assume irreducibility, which implies that the stabilizer of a generic point is discrete (dimension $0$). In this case, the dimension of the orbit is equal to the dimension of the group itself.\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group $U(k)$ is the real dimension of its Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{u}(k)$, which as established before is the space of $k \\times k$ anti-Hermitian matrices (or Hermitian matrices, as they are isomorphic as real vector spaces).\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\text{Gauge Group}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(U(k)) = k^{2}\n$$\n\n4.  **Final Calculation of the Dimension**\n\nWe assemble the pieces to find the real dimension of $\\mathcal{M}_{k,r}^{\\mathrm{fr}}$:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathcal{M}_{k,r}^{\\mathrm{fr}}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\text{Ambient Space}) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\text{Constraints}) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\text{Gauge Group})\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathcal{M}_{k,r}^{\\mathrm{fr}}) = (4k^{2} + 4kr) - (3k^{2}) - (k^{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathcal{M}_{k,r}^{\\mathrm{fr}}) = 4k^{2} + 4kr - 3k^{2} - k^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\mathcal{M}_{k,r}^{\\mathrm{fr}}) = (4k^{2} - 3k^{2} - k^{2}) + 4kr = 0 + 4kr\n$$\nThe resulting real dimension is $4kr$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4kr}$$", "id": "3025762"}]}
