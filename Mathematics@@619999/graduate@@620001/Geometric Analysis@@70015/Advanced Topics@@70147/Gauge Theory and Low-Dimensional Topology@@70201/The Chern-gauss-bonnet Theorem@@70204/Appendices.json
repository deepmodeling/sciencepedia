Therefore, $u_x(1,y) = u_x(0,y)$ and $u_y(x,1) = u_y(x,0)$. Both integrals are zero.\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\Delta u(x,y) dx dy = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the Euler characteristic:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbb{T}^2) = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi}(0) = 0\n$$\nThis result confirms the well-known topological fact that the Euler characteristic of the $2$-torus is $0$, independently of the particular Riemannian metric it carries.

The Pfaffian, $\\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega)$, is a polynomial in the entries of the matrix $\\Omega$. Since the matrices $\\Omega^{g_c}$ and $\\Omega^g$ are identical, their Pfaffians must also be identical. The Pfaffian is a wedge product of $m$ of the $2$-form entries, resulting in a $2m$-form.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega^{g_c}) = \\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega^{g}).\n$$\nConsequently, the Euler forms are also identical:\n$$\nE(\\Omega^{g_c}) = (2\\pi)^{-m} \\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega^{g_c}) = (2\\pi)^{-m} \\operatorname{Pf}(\\Omega^{g}) = E(\\Omega^g).\n$$\nCritically, this equality is an equality of differential forms of degree $2m$ on the manifold $M$. Let $\\alpha = E(\\Omega^g)$. Then we have shown that $E(\\Omega^{g_c}) = \\alpha$ for all $c>0$. The form $\\alpha$ does not depend on $c$.\n\nThe functional $I(c)$ is the integral of this form over $M$:\n$$\nI(c) = \\int_M E(\\Omega^{g_c}) = \\int_M \\alpha.\n$$\nSince the integrand $\\alpha$ is a fixed $2m$-form on $M$ independent of $c$, its integral over the fixed manifold $M$ is a constant real number.\n$$\nI(c) = \\text{constant}.\n$$\nThe derivative of a constant function with respect to its variable is zero. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dc} I(c) = 0\n$$\nfor all $c>0$. Evaluating this derivative at $c=1$ gives the final answer.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dc}\\bigg|_{c=1}I(c) = 0.\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3034516"}]}
