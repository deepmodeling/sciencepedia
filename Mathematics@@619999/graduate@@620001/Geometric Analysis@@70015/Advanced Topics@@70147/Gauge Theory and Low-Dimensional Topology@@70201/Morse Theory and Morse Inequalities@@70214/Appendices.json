The index of a non-degenerate critical point is defined as the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the function at that point. Let $c_k(f)$ denote the number of critical points of index $k$ for a given Morse function $f$.\n\nThe topology of the manifold $M$ imposes constraints on the possible values of $c_k(f)$. These constraints are captured by the Morse inequalities, which relate the numbers $c_k(f)$ to the Betti numbers of the manifold, $b_k(M)$. The Betti numbers are a sequence of non-negative integers that are fundamental topological invariants. For any Morse function $f$ on a compact $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, the following relations hold:\n1.  The Weak Morse Inequalities: $c_k(f) \\ge b_k(M)$ for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n2.  The Euler Characteristic Identity: $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k c_k(f) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k b_k(M)$.\n\nNow, consider the real projective plane, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, which is a 2-dimensional compact, non-orientable manifold. For the purpose of applying Morse theory to non-orientable manifolds, it is standard to use homology with coefficients in the field of two elements, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The Betti numbers of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients are given by $b_0(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$, $b_1(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$, and $b_2(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$.\n\nBased on the principles provided, determine the minimum possible total number of critical points, $C = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} c_k(f)$, for any Morse function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}P^2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum total number of critical points, $C = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} c_k$, for any Morse function on the real projective plane, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. We are given the necessary tools from Morse theory to solve this.\n\nThe manifold is $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, which has dimension $n=2$. The indices $k$ for critical points can thus be $0, 1, 2$.\nThe Betti numbers with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients are given as:\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 1$\n$b_2 = 1$\n\nLet $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$ for an arbitrary Morse function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. The total number of critical points is $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. We want to find the minimum possible value of $C$.\n\nFirst, we apply the Weak Morse Inequalities, $c_k \\ge b_k$, for each index $k$:\nFor $k=0$: $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$. This means there must be at least one critical point of index 0 (a local minimum).\nFor $k=1$: $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 1$. This means there must be at least one critical point of index 1 (a saddle point).\nFor $k=2$: $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$. This means there must be at least one critical point of index 2 (a local maximum).\n\nSince $c_k$ must be integers, these inequalities imply that the smallest possible values for the counts of critical points are $c_0=1$, $c_1=1$, and $c_2=1$.\n\nLet's check if this minimal set of critical point counts is consistent with the second given rule, the Euler Characteristic Identity. The Euler characteristic of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, denoted $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2)$, is calculated from the Betti numbers:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^k b_k = (-1)^0 b_0 + (-1)^1 b_1 + (-1)^2 b_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThe identity requires that the alternating sum of the number of critical points also equals the Euler characteristic:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^k c_k = \\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2)\n$$\nLet's test our candidate minimal values, $c_0=1, c_1=1, c_2=1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^k c_k = (-1)^0 c_0 + (-1)^1 c_1 + (-1)^2 c_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThe result, 1, indeed matches the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$. This means that a set of critical points $\\{c_0=1, c_1=1, c_2=1\\}$ is topologically consistent.\n\nSince the Weak Morse Inequalities require $c_0 \\ge 1$, $c_1 \\ge 1$, and $c_2 \\ge 1$, the total number of critical points $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$ must satisfy:\n$$\nC = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nWe have found a configuration of critical points, namely one of each index, that has a total of 3 points and satisfies all the conditions of Morse theory. Therefore, the minimum possible total number of critical points is 3. Any smaller number would violate at least one of the Weak Morse Inequalities.

Using only foundational definitions and well-tested facts in Morse theory and algebraic topology, build the Morse chain complex with integer coefficients from the critical points of $f$, determine the Morse boundary operators by analyzing gradient flow lines and index differences, compute the resulting Morse homology groups $HM_{k}(S^{n}; \\mathbb{Z})$, and verify that they agree with the singular homology groups $H_{k}(S^{n}; \\mathbb{Z})$ obtained from a cellular decomposition.

The function is the height function $f: S^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x_1, \\dots, x_{n+1}) = x_{n+1}$. We are given that $f$ is a Morse function with exactly two nondegenerate critical points, having Morse indices $0$ and $n$.\n\nFirst, we identify these critical points. They are the points where the gradient of $f$ restricted to the tangent space of $S^n$ vanishes. These occur at the south pole $p_S = (0, \\dots, 0, -1)$ and the north pole $p_N = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$.\nAt the south pole $p_S$, the function has a local minimum. In local coordinates $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$ around $p_S$, the function can be approximated by $f(y) \\approx f(p_S) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n H_{ij} y_i y_j$. Near $p_S$, $x_{n+1} = -\\sqrt{1 - \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\approx -1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. The Hessian is a positive-definite matrix ($I_n$), so it has $0$ negative eigenvalues. The Morse index at $p_S$ is $0$. We denote this critical point as $c_0$.\nAt the north pole $p_N$, the function has a local maximum. Near $p_N$, $x_{n+1} = \\sqrt{1 - \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. The Hessian is a negative-definite matrix ($-I_n$), so it has $n$ negative eigenvalues. The Morse index at $p_N$ is $n$. We denote this critical point as $c_n$.\nThe given information is thus verified. The problem implicitly requires $n \\ge 1$, because if $n=0$, $S^0 = \\{-1, 1\\}$, and both points are critical points of index $0$, which contradicts the given indices of $0$ and $n$.\n\nThe Morse chain complex $(C_*(f; \\mathbb{Z}), \\partial_*)$ is constructed from these critical points. The $k$-th chain group, $C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z})$, is the free abelian group generated by the critical points of index $k$.\nFor our function $f$ on $S^n$, the chain groups are:\n$C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\n$C_0(f; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$C_n(f; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_n \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe Morse chain complex is therefore:\n$$\n\\dots \\to 0 \\to C_n(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_n} C_{n-1}(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\dots \\to C_1(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} C_0(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0\n$$\nSubstituting the specific chain groups, this becomes:\n$$\n\\dots \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_n \\xrightarrow{\\partial_n} 0 \\to \\dots \\to 0 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_0 \\to 0\n$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the boundary operators, or differentials, $\\partial_k: C_k \\to C_{k-1}$. The coefficient of a generator $q \\in C_{k-1}$ in the expansion of $\\partial_k(p)$ for a generator $p \\in C_k$ is the algebraic count of gradient flow lines from $p$ to $q$. For this count to be non-zero, the dimension of the moduli space of flow lines between $p$ and $q$, which is $\\mathrm{ind}(p) - \\mathrm{ind}(q) - 1$, must be $0$. This implies that the indices must differ by exactly $1$, i.e., $\\mathrm{ind}(p) - \\mathrm{ind}(q) = 1$.\n\nWe analyze two cases for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nCase 1: $n > 1$.\nThe indices of the critical points are $n$ and $0$. The difference is $n-0=n$. Since $n > 1$, the index difference between any two critical points is never $1$. Therefore, for any $k$, it is not possible to have critical points of both index $k$ and $k-1$. This means that for any $k$, either the domain $C_k$ or the codomain $C_{k-1}$ of the differential $\\partial_k$ is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. Consequently, all boundary maps must be the zero map: $\\partial_k = 0$ for all $k$.\n\nCase 2: $n = 1$.\nThe manifold is the circle $S^1$. The critical points are $c_1$ (index $1$) and $c_0$ (index $0$). The index difference is $1 - 0 = 1$. Thus, the differential $\\partial_1: C_1(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to C_0(f; \\mathbb{Z})$ could be non-zero. The chain complex is $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_1 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_0 \\to 0$.\nThe differential is given by $\\partial_1(c_1) = m \\cdot c_0$, where $m$ is the algebraic count of gradient flow lines from $c_1$ to $c_0$. The gradient flow lines of the height function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_2$ on $S^1$ are the two semicircles connecting the north pole $c_1=(0,1)$ to the south pole $c_0=(0,-1)$. Let's call them $\\gamma_L$ (left semicircle, $x_1 < 0$) and $\\gamma_R$ (right semicircle, $x_1 > 0$). The coefficient $m$ is the sum of the signs of these two flow lines.\nTo determine the signs, we consider the isometry $\\sigma: S^1 \\to S^1$ given by $\\sigma(x_1, x_2) = (-x_1, x_2)$, which is a reflection across the $x_2$-axis. This map has the following properties:\n1. It preserves the function: $f(\\sigma(x)) = x_2 = f(x)$.\n2. It preserves the Riemannian metric.\n3. It fixes the critical points: $\\sigma(c_1)=c_1$ and $\\sigma(c_0)=c_0$.\n4. It swaps the two flow lines: $\\sigma(\\gamma_L) = \\gamma_R$ and $\\sigma(\\gamma_R) = \\gamma_L$.\nThe sign of a flow line depends on a choice of orientation of the unstable manifolds. Let us fix an orientation for $W^u(c_1)$, the unstable manifold of $c_1$, which is a one-dimensional tangent space at $c_1$. The derivative of the symmetry map, $d\\sigma_{c_1}$, acts on this space. Since $\\sigma$ is a reflection, its derivative reverses orientation, meaning $\\det(d\\sigma_{c_1}|_{T_{c_1}W^u(c_1)}) = -1$.\nAccording to Morse theory, the sign of a transformed flow line $\\sigma \\circ \\gamma$ is related to the sign of the original line $\\gamma$ by the orientations of the symmetry map on the unstable manifold of the source and stable manifold of the target. A key result states that the sign of $\\sigma(\\gamma)$ is $(-\\text{1}) \\times \\text{sign}(\\gamma)$ if the symmetry acts by reversing orientation on the unstable manifold of the source. Thus, $\\text{sign}(\\gamma_L) = \\text{sign}(\\sigma(\\gamma_R)) = - \\text{sign}(\\gamma_R)$.\nThe total algebraic count is $m = \\text{sign}(\\gamma_L) + \\text{sign}(\\gamma_R) = -\\text{sign}(\\gamma_R) + \\text{sign}(\\gamma_R) = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\partial_1=0$.\n\nIn all cases for $n \\ge 1$, all boundary operators in the Morse complex are zero.\n\nNow we compute the Morse homology groups $HM_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker(\\partial_k) / \\mathrm{im}(\\partial_{k+1})$.\nSince $\\partial_k = 0$ for all $k$, we have $\\ker(\\partial_k) = C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\mathrm{im}(\\partial_{k+1}) = \\{0\\}$.\nThus, $HM_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z})$. The resulting homology groups are:\n$HM_n(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$HM_0(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$HM_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\{0\\}$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of Morse theory states that the Morse homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of the manifold, $HM_*(M) \\cong H_*(M)$. We can verify this result by computing the singular homology of $S^n$ using a cellular decomposition.\nA minimal cellular decomposition of $S^n$ for $n \\ge 1$ consists of one $0$-cell, say $e^0$, and one $n$-cell, $e^n$.\nThe cellular chain complex $(C^{\\text{cell}}_*(S^n), d_*)$ is:\n$C^{\\text{cell}}_n(S^n) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot e^n \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$C^{\\text{cell}}_0(S^n) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot e^0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$C^{\\text{cell}}_k(S^n) = \\{0\\}$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\nThe cellular boundary map $d_k$ is determined by the degree of the attaching maps. The $n$-cell $e^n$ is attached to the $(n-1)$-skeleton, which is just the $0$-cell $e^0$. The attaching map is $\\phi: \\partial D^n \\cong S^{n-1} \\to \\{e^0\\}$.\nIf $n>1$, the target space of $d_n$ is $C^{\\text{cell}}_{n-1}(S^n)=\\{0\\}$, so $d_n=0$.\nIf $n=1$, the attaching map is $\\phi: S^0 \\to \\{e^0\\}$. The degree of this map is the sum of signs of preimages of a point, which is $(+1) + (-1) = 0$. So, $d_1=0$.\nAll other differentials are also zero because their domain or codomain is trivial.\nThus, the cellular homology is $H_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong C^{\\text{cell}}_k(S^n)$.\n$H_n(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$H_0(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$H_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\{0\\}$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\nThis perfectly matches the Morse homology groups we computed.\n\nFinally, we find the Poincar√© polynomial $P_{S^n}(t) = \\sum_{k \\ge 0} b_k t^k$, where $b_k = \\operatorname{rank} H_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z})$ are the Betti numbers.\nFrom our calculation, the Betti numbers for $S^n$ (with $n \\ge 1$) are:\n$b_n = \\operatorname{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$.\n$b_0 = \\operatorname{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$.\n$b_k = 0$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\nSubstituting these into the definition of the Poincar√© polynomial:\n$P_{S^n}(t) = b_0 t^0 + b_1 t^1 + \\dots + b_n t^n = 1 \\cdot t^0 + 0 \\cdot t^1 + \\dots + 0 \\cdot t^{n-1} + 1 \\cdot t^n$.\nThis simplifies to the final expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 + t^{n}}\n$$", "id": "3032320"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, this final practice delves into a more intricate scenario where the Morse differential is non-trivial.

It is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, the first Betti number is $b_1 = \\operatorname{rank}(H_1(M)) = 1$.\n\nComputation of $b_0$:\n$H_0(M) = \\ker(\\partial_0) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1)$.\n$\\ker(\\partial_0) = C_0(f) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p \\rangle$ since $\\partial_0$ is the zero map.\nFrom the calculation for $H_1$, $\\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1) = \\{0\\}$.\n$H_0(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p \\rangle / \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, the zeroth Betti number is $b_0 = \\operatorname{rank}(H_0(M)) = 1$. This is consistent with the manifold $M$ being connected.\n\nThe Betti numbers are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 1$, and $b_3 = 1$.\nThe Poincar√© polynomial $P_M(t)$ is defined as $P_M(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{3} b_k t^k$.\nSubstituting the computed Betti numbers:\n$P_M(t) = b_0 t^0 + b_1 t^1 + b_2 t^2 + b_3 t^3 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot t^1 + 1 \\cdot t^2 + 1 \\cdot t^3$.\n$$\nP_M(t) = 1 + t + t^2 + t^3\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form polynomial.\nAs a check, these Betti numbers, $b_k = b_{3-k}$, satisfy Poincar√© duality for a closed, oriented $3$-manifold. Also, the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k b_k = 1-1+1-1=0$. This must equal the alternating sum of the number of cells (critical points), $\\sum_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k c_k = 1-2+2-1=0$, which holds.\nThe manifold with these homology groups is homotopy equivalent to $S^1 \\times S^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 + t + t^{2} + t^{3}}\n$$", "id": "3032306"}]}
