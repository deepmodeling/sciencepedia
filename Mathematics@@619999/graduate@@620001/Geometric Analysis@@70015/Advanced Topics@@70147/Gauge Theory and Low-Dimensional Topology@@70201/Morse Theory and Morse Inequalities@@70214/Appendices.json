The index of a non-degenerate critical point is defined as the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the function at that point. Let $c_k(f)$ denote the number of critical points of index $k$ for a given Morse function $f$.\n\nThe topology of the manifold $M$ imposes constraints on the possible values of $c_k(f)$. These constraints are captured by the Morse inequalities, which relate the numbers $c_k(f)$ to the Betti numbers of the manifold, $b_k(M)$. The Betti numbers are a sequence of non-negative integers that are fundamental topological invariants. For any Morse function $f$ on a compact $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, the following relations hold:\n1.  The Weak Morse Inequalities: $c_k(f) \\ge b_k(M)$ for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n2.  The Euler Characteristic Identity: $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k c_k(f) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k b_k(M)$.\n\nNow, consider the real projective plane, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, which is a 2-dimensional compact, non-orientable manifold. For the purpose of applying Morse theory to non-orientable manifolds, it is standard to use homology with coefficients in the field of two elements, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The Betti numbers of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients are given by $b_0(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$, $b_1(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$, and $b_2(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$.\n\nBased on the principles provided, determine the minimum possible total number of critical points, $C = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} c_k(f)$, for any Morse function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}P^2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum total number of critical points, $C = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} c_k$, for any Morse function on the real projective plane, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$.

The indices $k$ for critical points can thus be $0, 1, 2$.\nThe Betti numbers with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients are given as:\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 1$\n$b_2 = 1$\n\nLet $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$ for an arbitrary Morse function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. The total number of critical points is $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. We want to find the minimum possible value of $C$.\n\nFirst, we apply the Weak Morse Inequalities, $c_k \\ge b_k$, for each index $k$:\nFor $k=0$: $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$. This means there must be at least one critical point of index 0 (a local minimum).\nFor $k=1$: $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 1$. This means there must be at least one critical point of index 1 (a saddle point).\nFor $k=2$: $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$. This means there must be at least one critical point of index 2 (a local maximum).\n\nSince $c_k$ must be integers, these inequalities imply that the smallest possible values for the counts of critical points are $c_0=1$, $c_1=1$, and $c_2=1$.\n\nLet's check if this minimal set of critical point counts is consistent with the second given rule, the Euler Characteristic Identity. The Euler characteristic of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, denoted $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2)$, is calculated from the Betti numbers:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^k b_k = (-1)^0 b_0 + (-1)^1 b_1 + (-1)^2 b_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThe identity requires that the alternating sum of the number of critical points also equals the Euler characteristic:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^k c_k = \\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2)\n$$\nLet's test our candidate minimal values, $c_0=1, c_1=1, c_2=1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^k c_k = (-1)^0 c_0 + (-1)^1 c_1 + (-1)^2 c_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThe result, 1, indeed matches the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1$.

The function is the height function $f: S^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x_1, \\dots, x_{n+1}) = x_{n+1}$. We are given that $f$ is a Morse function with exactly two nondegenerate critical points, having Morse indices $0$ and $n$.\n\nFirst, we identify these critical points. They are the points where the gradient of $f$ restricted to the tangent space of $S^n$ vanishes. These occur at the south pole $p_S = (0, \\dots, 0, -1)$ and the north pole $p_N = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$.\nAt the south pole $p_S$, the function has a local minimum. In local coordinates $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$ around $p_S$, the function can be approximated by $f(y) \\approx f(p_S) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n H_{ij} y_i y_j$. Near $p_S$, $x_{n+1} = -\\sqrt{1 - \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\approx -1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. The Hessian is a positive-definite matrix ($I_n$), so it has $0$ negative eigenvalues. The Morse index at $p_S$ is $0$. We denote this critical point as $c_0$.\nAt the north pole $p_N$, the function has a local maximum. Near $p_N$, $x_{n+1} = \\sqrt{1 - \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. The Hessian is a negative-definite matrix ($-I_n$), so it has $n$ negative eigenvalues. The Morse index at $p_N$ is $n$. We denote this critical point as $c_n$.\nThe given information is thus verified. The problem implicitly requires $n \\ge 1$, because if $n=0$, $S^0 = \\{-1, 1\\}$, and both points are critical points of index $0$, which contradicts the given indices of $0$ and $n$.\n\nThe Morse chain complex $(C_*(f; \\mathbb{Z}), \\partial_*)$ is constructed from these critical points. The $k$-th chain group, $C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z})$, is the free abelian group generated by the critical points of index $k$.\nFor our function $f$ on $S^n$, the chain groups are:\n$C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\n$C_0(f; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$C_n(f; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_n \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe Morse chain complex is therefore:\n$$\n\\dots \\to 0 \\to C_n(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_n} C_{n-1}(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\dots \\to C_1(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} C_0(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0\n$$\nSubstituting the specific chain groups, this becomes:\n$$\n\\dots \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_n \\xrightarrow{\\partial_n} 0 \\to \\dots \\to 0 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_0 \\to 0\n$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the boundary operators, or differentials, $\\partial_k: C_k \\to C_{k-1}$. The coefficient of a generator $q \\in C_{k-1}$ in the expansion of $\\partial_k(p)$ for a generator $p \\in C_k$ is the algebraic count of gradient flow lines from $p$ to $q$. For this count to be non-zero, the dimension of the moduli space of flow lines between $p$ and $q$, which is $\\mathrm{ind}(p) - \\mathrm{ind}(q) - 1$, must be $0$. This implies that the indices must differ by exactly $1$, i.e., $\\mathrm{ind}(p) - \\mathrm{ind}(q) = 1$.\n\nWe analyze two cases for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nCase 1: $n > 1$.\nThe indices of the critical points are $n$ and $0$. The difference is $n-0=n$. Since $n > 1$, the index difference between any two critical points is never $1$. Therefore, for any $k$, it is not possible to have critical points of both index $k$ and $k-1$. This means that for any $k$, either the domain $C_k$ or the codomain $C_{k-1}$ of the differential $\\partial_k$ is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. Consequently, all boundary maps must be the zero map: $\\partial_k = 0$ for all $k$.\n\nCase 2: $n = 1$.\nThe manifold is the circle $S^1$. The critical points are $c_1$ (index $1$) and $c_0$ (index $0$). The index difference is $1 - 0 = 1$. Thus, the differential $\\partial_1: C_1(f; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to C_0(f; \\mathbb{Z})$ could be non-zero. The chain complex is $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_1 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_0 \\to 0$.\nThe differential is given by $\\partial_1(c_1) = m \\cdot c_0$, where $m$ is the algebraic count of gradient flow lines from $c_1$ to $c_0$. The gradient flow lines of the height function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_2$ on $S^1$ are the two semicircles connecting the north pole $c_1=(0,1)$ to the south pole $c_0=(0,-1)$. Let's call them $\\gamma_L$ (left semicircle, $x_1 < 0$) and $\\gamma_R$ (right semicircle, $x_1 > 0$). The coefficient $m$ is the sum of the signs of these two flow lines.\nTo determine the signs, we consider the isometry $\\sigma: S^1 \\to S^1$ given by $\\sigma(x_1, x_2) = (-x_1, x_2)$, which is a reflection across the $x_2$-axis. This map has the following properties:\n1. It preserves the function: $f(\\sigma(x)) = x_2 = f(x)$.\n2. It preserves the Riemannian metric.\n3. It fixes the critical points: $\\sigma(c_1)=c_1$ and $\\sigma(c_0)=c_0$.\n4. It swaps the two flow lines: $\\sigma(\\gamma_L) = \\gamma_R$ and $\\sigma(\\gamma_R) = \\gamma_L$.\nThe sign of a flow line depends on a choice of orientation of the unstable manifolds. Let us fix an orientation for $W^u(c_1)$, the unstable manifold of $c_1$, which is a one-dimensional tangent space at $c_1$. The derivative of the symmetry map, $d\\sigma_{c_1}$, acts on this space. Since $\\sigma$ is a reflection, its derivative reverses orientation, meaning $\\det(d\\sigma_{c_1}|_{T_{c_1}W^u(c_1)}) = -1$.\nAccording to Morse theory, the sign of a transformed flow line $\\sigma \\circ \\gamma$ is related to the sign of the original line $\\gamma$ by the orientations of the symmetry map on the unstable manifold of the source and stable manifold of the target. A key result states that the sign of $\\sigma(\\gamma)$ is $(-\\text{1}) \\times \\text{sign}(\\gamma)$ if the symmetry acts by reversing orientation on the unstable manifold of the source. Thus, $\\text{sign}(\\gamma_L) = \\text{sign}(\\sigma(\\gamma_R)) = - \\text{sign}(\\gamma_R)$.\nThe total algebraic count is $m = \\text{sign}(\\gamma_L) + \\text{sign}(\\gamma_R) = -\\text{sign}(\\gamma_R) + \\text{sign}(\\gamma_R) = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\partial_1=0$.\n\nIn all cases for $n \\ge 1$, all boundary operators in the Morse complex are zero.\n\nNow we compute the Morse homology groups $HM_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker(\\partial_k) / \\mathrm{im}(\\partial_{k+1})$.\nSince $\\partial_k = 0$ for all $k$, we have $\\ker(\\partial_k) = C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\mathrm{im}(\\partial_{k+1}) = \\{0\\}$.\nThus, $HM_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong C_k(f; \\mathbb{Z})$. The resulting homology groups are:\n$HM_n(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$HM_0(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$HM_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\{0\\}$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of Morse theory states that the Morse homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of the manifold, $HM_*(M) \\cong H_*(M)$. We can verify this result by computing the singular homology of $S^n$ using a cellular decomposition.\nA minimal cellular decomposition of $S^n$ for $n \\ge 1$ consists of one $0$-cell, say $e^0$, and one $n$-cell, $e^n$.\nThe cellular chain complex $(C^{\\text{cell}}_*(S^n), d_*)$ is:\n$C^{\\text{cell}}_n(S^n) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot e^n \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$C^{\\text{cell}}_0(S^n) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot e^0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$C^{\\text{cell}}_k(S^n) = \\{0\\}$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\nThe cellular boundary map $d_k$ is determined by the degree of the attaching maps. The $n$-cell $e^n$ is attached to the $(n-1)$-skeleton, which is just the $0$-cell $e^0$. The attaching map is $\\phi: \\partial D^n \\cong S^{n-1} \\to \\{e^0\\}$.\nIf $n>1$, the target space of $d_n$ is $C^{\\text{cell}}_{n-1}(S^n)=\\{0\\}$, so $d_n=0$.\nIf $n=1$, the attaching map is $\\phi: S^0 \\to \\{e^0\\}$. The degree of this map is the sum of signs of preimages of a point, which is $(+1) + (-1) = 0$. So, $d_1=0$.\nAll other differentials are also zero because their domain or codomain is trivial.\nThus, the cellular homology is $H_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong C^{\\text{cell}}_k(S^n)$.\n$H_n(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$H_0(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$H_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\{0\\}$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\nThis perfectly matches the Morse homology groups we computed.\n\nFinally, we find the Poincaré polynomial $P_{S^n}(t) = \\sum_{k \\ge 0} b_k t^k$, where $b_k = \\operatorname{rank} H_k(S^n; \\mathbb{Z})$ are the Betti numbers.\nFrom our calculation, the Betti numbers for $S^n$ (with $n \\ge 1$) are:\n$b_n = \\operatorname{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$.\n$b_0 = \\operatorname{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$.\n$b_k = 0$ for $k \\notin \\{0, n\\}$.\nSubstituting these into the definition of the Poincaré polynomial:\n$P_{S^n}(t) = b_0 t^0 + b_1 t^1 + \\dots + b_n t^n = 1 \\cdot t^0 + 0 \\cdot t^1 + \\dots + 0 \\cdot t^{n-1} + 1 \\cdot t^n$.\nThis simplifies to the final expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 + t^{n}}\n$$", "id": "3032320"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, this final practice delves into a more intricate scenario where the Morse differential is non-trivial.

It is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, the first Betti number is $b_1 = \\operatorname{rank}(H_1(M)) = 1$.\n\nComputation of $b_0$:\n$H_0(M) = \\ker(\\partial_0) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1)$.\n$\\ker(\\partial_0) = C_0(f) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p \\rangle$ since $\\partial_0$ is the zero map.\nFrom the calculation for $H_1$, $\\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1) = \\{0\\}$.\n$H_0(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p \\rangle / \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, the zeroth Betti number is $b_0 = \\operatorname{rank}(H_0(M)) = 1$. This is consistent with the manifold $M$ being connected.\n\nThe Betti numbers are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 1$, and $b_3 = 1$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial $P_M(t)$ is defined as $P_M(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{3} b_k t^k$.\nSubstituting the computed Betti numbers:\n$P_M(t) = b_0 t^0 + b_1 t^1 + b_2 t^2 + b_3 t^3 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot t^1 + 1 \\cdot t^2 + 1 \\cdot t^3$.\n$$\nP_M(t) = 1 + t + t^2 + t^3\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form polynomial.\nAs a check, these Betti numbers, $b_k = b_{3-k}$, satisfy Poincaré duality for a closed, oriented $3$-manifold. Also, the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k b_k = 1-1+1-1=0$. This must equal the alternating sum of the number of cells (critical points), $\\sum_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k c_k = 1-2+2-1=0$, which holds.\nThe manifold with these homology groups is homotopy equivalent to $S^1 \\times S^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 + t + t^{2} + t^{3}}\n$$", "id": "3032306"}]}
