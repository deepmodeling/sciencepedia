By explicitly calculating the transition function for the tangent bundle of the circle, $TS^1$, you will see how this abstract topological information is encoded in local coordinate data, providing a direct link between the Čech cohomology definition of $w_1$ and the bundle's geometric structure [@problem_id:1639139].", "problem": "This problem explores the first Stiefel-Whitney class, a fundamental invariant in the study of real vector bundles.\n\nA real line bundle $E$ over a topological space $B$ can be constructed using an open cover $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ of $B$ and a set of transition functions $g_{\\alpha\\beta}: U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta \\to \\mathbb{R}^* = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The first Stiefel-Whitney class, $w_1(E)$, is an element of the first cohomology group $H^1(B; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$ that serves as an obstruction to the bundle being trivial. A line bundle $E$ is trivial (isomorphic to the product bundle $B \\times \\mathbb{R}$) if and only if $w_1(E) = 0$.\n\nWe will consider line bundles over the circle $S^1 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2+y^2=1\\}$. We use an open cover consisting of two sets: $U_N = S^1 \\setminus \\{(0,1)\\}$ (the circle minus the \"North pole\") and $U_S = S^1 \\setminus \\{(0,-1)\\}$ (the circle minus the \"South pole\"). The overlap $U_N \\cap U_S$ consists of two disjoint connected components: the right semicircle ($x>0$) and the left semicircle ($x<0$). The cohomology group is $H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nFor a line bundle over $S^1$ defined with respect to this cover, the value of its first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(E)$ can be determined from the sign of its transition function $g_{SN}: U_N \\cap U_S \\to \\mathbb{R}^*$. The procedure is as follows: if the sign of $g_{SN}$ is the same on both connected components of the overlap, then $w_1(E)=0$. If the sign of $g_{SN}$ is different on the two components, then $w_1(E)=1$.\n\nYou are asked to determine the first Stiefel-Whitney classes for two different line bundles over $S^1$.\n\n**Bundle 1: The Tangent Bundle $E_1 = TS^1$**\nThe tangent bundle of the circle is a real line bundle. We use local coordinates given by stereographic projections.\n- On $U_N$, the coordinate $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is given by the map $\\phi_N: \\mathbb{R} \\to U_N$, where $\\phi_N(t) = \\left(\\frac{2t}{t^2+1}, \\frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}\\right)$. A local basis for the tangent space at a point $\\phi_N(t)$ is the vector $e_N(t) = \\frac{d\\phi_N}{dt}$.\n- On $U_S$, the coordinate $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is given by the map $\\phi_S: \\mathbb{R} \\to U_S$, where $\\phi_S(s) = \\left(\\frac{2s}{s^2+1}, \\frac{1-s^2}{s^2+1}\\right)$. A local basis for the tangent space at a point $\\phi_S(s)$ is the vector $e_S(s) = \\frac{d\\phi_S}{ds}$.\nOn the overlap $U_N \\cap U_S$, a point can be described by either coordinate $t$ or $s$. These coordinates are related by $s = 1/t$. The transition function $g_{SN}^{(1)}(t)$ is defined by the relation $e_N(t) = g_{SN}^{(1)}(t) \\cdot e_S(s(t))$.\n\n**Bundle 2: A Non-trivial Line Bundle $E_2$**\nThe second line bundle, $E_2$, is defined over $S^1$ using the same open cover $\\{U_N, U_S\\}$ and local coordinates $\\{t, s\\}$. Its transition function is explicitly given as $g_{SN}^{(2)}(t) = t$.\n\n**Question:**\nDetermine the ordered pair of the first Stiefel-Whitney classes $(w_1(E_1), w_1(E_2))$. Your answer should be a pair of integers from the set $\\{0, 1\\}$.", "solution": "We use the given cover $\\{U_N, U_S\\}$ of $S^1$ and the rule: $w_1(E)=0$ if the sign of the transition function on the two connected components of $U_N \\cap U_S$ agrees, and $w_1(E)=1$ if the signs differ. The two components of $U_N \\cap U_S$ are the right semicircle ($x>0$) and the left semicircle ($x<0$). In the stereographic coordinate $t$ on $U_N$, we have $x= \\frac{2t}{t^2+1}$, so $x>0$ corresponds to $t>0$ and $x<0$ corresponds to $t<0$.\n\n**Bundle 1: $E_1 = TS^1$**\nOn the overlap, the coordinates are related by $s=1/t$, and the embeddings satisfy $\\phi_N(t)=\\phi_S(s(t))$. Differentiating with respect to $t$ and using the chain rule gives the relation between the basis vectors:\n$$\ne_N(t) = \\frac{d\\phi_N}{dt}(t) = \\frac{d\\phi_S}{ds}(s(t))\\cdot\\frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \\left(\\frac{ds}{dt}(t)\\right) e_S(s(t))\n$$\nHence the transition function is given by the derivative of the coordinate change:\n$$\ng_{SN}^{(1)}(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{t^2}\n$$\nFor any non-zero $t$, whether positive (right semicircle) or negative (left semicircle), the value of $g_{SN}^{(1)}(t) = -1/t^2$ is always negative. Since the sign is the same on both components of the overlap, we have $w_1(E_1)=0$. This confirms that $TS^1$ is a trivial (and thus orientable) bundle.\n\n**Bundle 2: $E_2$ with $g_{SN}^{(2)}(t)=t$**\nThe transition function is $g_{SN}^{(2)}(t) = t$.\n- On the right semicircle, $t>0$, so the sign is positive.\n- On the left semicircle, $t<0$, so the sign is negative.\nThe signs differ on the two components, hence $w_1(E_2)=1$. This corresponds to the non-trivial Möbius bundle.\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair is $(w_1(E_1), w_1(E_2)) = (0,1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1639139"}, {"introduction": "Moving from real to complex vector bundles, we explore the significantly richer structure of Chern classes.
