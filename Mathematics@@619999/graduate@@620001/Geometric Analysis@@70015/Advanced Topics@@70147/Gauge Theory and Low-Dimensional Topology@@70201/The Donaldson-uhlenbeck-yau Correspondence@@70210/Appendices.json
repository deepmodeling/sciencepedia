A key result in this context is the Grothendieck splitting theorem, which states that any holomorphic vector bundle $E$ over $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ decomposes into a direct sum of holomorphic line bundles. That is,\n$$E \\cong \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{r} \\mathcal{O}(a_i)$$\nwhere $r = \\operatorname{rk}(E)$ is the rank of the bundle, $\\mathcal{O}(a_i)$ is the holomorphic line bundle of degree $a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and the integers $a_i$ are uniquely determined up to permutation.\n\nThe degree of this bundle $E$ is given by the degree of its determinant line bundle, $\\det(E) = \\bigwedge^r E$.\n$$\\deg(E) = \\deg(\\det(E)) = \\deg\\left(\\bigotimes_{i=1}^{r} \\mathcal{O}(a_i)\\right) = \\deg\\left(\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i$$\nThe slope of $E$, denoted $\\mu(E)$, is defined as $\\mu(E) = \\frac{\\deg(E)}{\\operatorname{rk}(E)} = \\frac{1}{r}\\sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i$.\n\nA holomorphic vector bundle $E$ is defined to be slope-stable if for every proper non-zero coherent subsheaf $F \\subset E$ (which on $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is also a vector bundle), the inequality $\\mu(F)  \\mu(E)$ holds.\n\nLet us analyze the bundle $E = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{r} \\mathcal{O}(a_i)$. If the rank $r > 1$, we can consider a proper subbundle. For instance, without loss of generality, let the degrees be ordered such that $a_1 \\geq a_2 \\geq \\dots \\geq a_r$. We can take $F = \\mathcal{O}(a_1)$ as a subbundle of $E$. The rank of $F$ is $1$ and its degree is $a_1$, so its slope is $\\mu(F) = a_1$. For $E$ to be stable, we would require $\\mu(F)  \\mu(E)$, which means $a_1  \\frac{1}{r}\\sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i$. This inequality can be written as $r a_1  \\sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i$, or $(r-1)a_1  \\sum_{i=2}^{r} a_i$. However, since $a_1$ is the maximum of the set $\\{a_i\\}$, we have $a_i \\leq a_1$ for all $i=2, \\dots, r$. Therefore, $\\sum_{i=2}^{r} a_i \\leq \\sum_{i=2}^{r} a_1 = (r-1)a_1$. This contradicts the strict inequality required for stability. Thus, if $r > 1$, the bundle $E$ cannot be stable.\n\nIf the rank $r=1$, the bundle is a line bundle $E=L=\\mathcal{O}(d)$ for some $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. A line bundle has no proper non-zero subbundles (or subsheaves). Therefore, the condition for stability is satisfied vacuously.\nIn conclusion, the slope-stable holomorphic vector bundles on $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ are precisely the holomorphic line bundles, which are classified by their degree $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNext, we address the second part of the problem. We are given a holomorphic line bundle $L \\to X$ of degree $d$. As established, $L$ is a stable bundle. A bundle is polystable if it is a direct sum of stable bundles of the same slope. Since $L$ is stable, it is trivially polystable. The Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau (DUY) correspondence states that a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact Kähler manifold admits a Hermitian-Einstein metric if and only if it is polystable. Thus, $L$ admits a Hermitian-Einstein metric $h$.\n\nLet $F_h$ be the Chern curvature of the Chern connection of $(L,h)$. Since $L$ is a line bundle, its rank is $1$, so its endomorphism bundle is the trivial line bundle. The Hermitian-Einstein condition simplifies from the general tensorial equation to a scalar equation:\n$$\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda_{\\omega}F_{h}=\\lambda$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a real constant, and $\\Lambda_{\\omega}$ is the adjoint of the operator of wedging with the Kähler form $\\omega$.\n\nThe manifold $X = \\mathbb{P}^1$ has complex dimension $n=1$. The curvature $F_h$ is a $2$-form on a real $2$-dimensional manifold, so it is a top-degree form. In complex geometry, $F_h$ is a $(1,1)$-form. On a complex manifold of dimension $1$, the space of $(1,1)$-forms at any point is a $1$-dimensional real vector space, spanned by the Kähler form $\\omega$. Therefore, $F_h$ must be proportional to $\\omega$ at every point, i.e., $F_h = k(x) \\omega$ for some smooth function $k(x)$ on $X$.\n\nBy Chern-Weil theory, the first Chern class $c_1(L) \\in H^2(X, \\mathbb{R})$ is represented by the de Rham class of the first Chern form, $c_1(L,h) = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2\\pi}F_h$. Since $c_1(L,h)$ represents a real cohomology class, it must be a real-valued $2$-form. This implies that $F_h$ must be a purely imaginary $2$-form. Let us write $F_h = \\sqrt{-1}G$, where $G$ is a real $2$-form. Since $F_h$ is a $(1,1)$-form, so is $G$. Thus, we can write $G = f(x)\\omega$ for a real-valued function $f(x)$. This gives $F_h = \\sqrt{-1}f(x)\\omega$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $F_h$ into the Hermitian-Einstein equation:\n$$\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\Lambda_{\\omega}(\\sqrt{-1}f(x)\\omega) = \\lambda$$\n$$(\\sqrt{-1})^2 \\Lambda_{\\omega}(f(x)\\omega) = \\lambda$$\n$$-f(x)\\Lambda_{\\omega}(\\omega) = \\lambda$$\nWe must determine the value of $\\Lambda_{\\omega}(\\omega)$. On a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $n$, the operators $L_\\omega(\\alpha) = \\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ and its adjoint $\\Lambda_\\omega$ satisfy the commutation relation $[L_\\omega, \\Lambda_\\omega]\\alpha = (k-n)\\alpha$ for any form $\\alpha$ of total degree $k$. For $X=\\mathbb{P}^1$, we have $n=1$. The Kähler form $\\omega$ is a $2$-form, so $k=2$. Applying the relation to $\\omega$:\n$$[L_\\omega, \\Lambda_\\omega]\\omega = (2-1)\\omega = \\omega$$\n$$L_\\omega(\\Lambda_\\omega(\\omega)) - \\Lambda_\\omega(L_\\omega(\\omega)) = \\omega$$\nThe term $L_\\omega(\\omega)$ is $\\omega \\wedge \\omega$. Since $\\omega$ is a $2$-form on a $2$-dimensional manifold, $\\omega \\wedge \\omega = 0$. The equation simplifies to $L_\\omega(\\Lambda_\\omega(\\omega)) = \\omega$.\nThe operator $\\Lambda_\\omega$ maps $2$-forms to $0$-forms (functions). Let $\\Lambda_\\omega(\\omega) = c$ for some function $c$. Then the equation becomes $L_\\omega(c) = \\omega$, which is $c \\wedge \\omega = c\\omega = \\omega$. This implies that the function $c$ must be identically $1$. So, $\\Lambda_{\\omega}(\\omega)=1$.\n\nThe Hermitian-Einstein equation now reduces to $-f(x) \\cdot 1 = \\lambda$, or $f(x) = -\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda$ is a constant, the function $f(x)$ must also be the constant $-\\lambda$.\nThis gives us an explicit expression for the curvature form in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$F_h = \\sqrt{-1}(-\\lambda)\\omega = -\\sqrt{-1}\\lambda\\omega$$\nNow, we relate this to the topological degree $d$ of the line bundle $L$. The degree is given by the integral of the first Chern class over $X$:\n$$d = \\deg(L) = \\int_{X} c_1(L)$$\nUsing the Chern-Weil form representative:\n$$d = \\int_{X} c_1(L,h) = \\int_{X} \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2\\pi}F_h$$\nSubstituting our expression for $F_h$:\n$$d = \\int_{X} \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2\\pi} (-\\sqrt{-1}\\lambda\\omega) = \\int_{X} \\frac{-(\\sqrt{-1})^2\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\omega = \\int_{X} \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\omega$$\nSince $\\lambda$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\int_{X}\\omega$$\nThe problem states that the total volume of $X$ is $\\operatorname{Vol}(X) = \\int_X\\omega = V$. Substituting this value:\n$$d = \\frac{\\lambda V}{2\\pi}$$\nFinally, we solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi d}{V}$$\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for the Hermitian-Einstein constant $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi d}{V}}$$", "id": "3034942"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to the stable line bundles explored previously, many vector bundles are unstable.

We are to use this result to explain the failure of existence of a Hermitian-Einstein metric on $E$ via the Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau (DUY) correspondence. The final answer required is the Harder–Narasimhan slope vector.\n\nFirst, let us establish the foundational definitions. Let $F$ be a holomorphic vector bundle over the compact Kähler manifold $(X, \\omega)$, where $X=\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ has complex dimension $n=1$. The Kähler form $\\omega$ is the Fubini-Study form, normalized such that the degree of the hyperplane bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is $1$.\n\nThe **rank** of $F$, denoted $\\operatorname{rk}(F)$, is the complex dimension of its fibers.\nThe **degree** of $F$ is defined as $\\deg(F) = \\int_{X} c_1(F)$, where $c_1(F)$ is the first Chern class of the determinant line bundle $\\det(F)$. For a line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ on $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$, its degree is $\\deg(\\mathcal{O}(k)) = k$. For a direct sum of bundles, the degree is additive: $\\deg(F_1 \\oplus F_2) = \\deg(F_1) + \\deg(F_2)$.\nThe **slope** of $F$ is the ratio $\\mu(F) = \\frac{\\deg(F)}{\\operatorname{rk}(F)}$.\nA bundle $E$ is **slope-stable** if for every proper, non-zero holomorphic subbundle $F \\subset E$ (i.e., $0  \\operatorname{rk}(F)  \\operatorname{rk}(E)$), the inequality $\\mu(F)  \\mu(E)$ holds. It is **slope-semistable** if $\\mu(F) \\le \\mu(E)$ holds for all such $F$. A bundle that is not semistable is called **unstable**.\nThe **Harder–Narasimhan (HN) filtration** of a bundle $E$ is a unique filtration by saturated holomorphic subbundles $0 = E_0 \\subsetneq E_1 \\subsetneq \\dots \\subsetneq E_k = E$ where each graded quotient $Q_i = E_i/E_{i-1}$ is slope-semistable and the slopes are strictly decreasing: $\\mu(Q_1)  \\mu(Q_2)  \\dots  \\mu(Q_k)$.\n\nLet's apply these definitions to the given bundle $E = \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)$ with $ab$.\n\n1.  **Properties of the bundle $E$**:\n    The rank of $E$ is $\\operatorname{rk}(E) = \\operatorname{rk}(\\mathcal{O}(a)) + \\operatorname{rk}(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    The degree of $E$ is $\\deg(E) = \\deg(\\mathcal{O}(a)) + \\deg(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = a+b$.\n    The slope of $E$ is $\\mu(E) = \\frac{\\deg(E)}{\\operatorname{rk}(E)} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Stability and Construction of the HN Filtration**:\n    To determine if $E$ is stable, we must examine its subbundles. According to Grothendieck's splitting theorem, any holomorphic vector bundle on $\\mathbb{P}^1$ splits into a direct sum of line bundles. This simplifies the analysis of subbundles.\n    Consider the natural inclusion of the direct summand $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ into $E$. This gives us a holomorphic subbundle $F = \\mathcal{O}(a)$.\n    The properties of this subbundle are:\n    $\\operatorname{rk}(F) = 1$.\n    $\\deg(F) = a$.\n    $\\mu(F) = \\frac{\\deg(F)}{\\operatorname{rk}(F)} = a$.\n\n    Now we compare the slope of the subbundle $F$ with the slope of the ambient bundle $E$:\n    $\\mu(F) = a$ and $\\mu(E) = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n    Since we are given $a  b$, we have $a+a  a+b$, which implies $2a  a+b$, and therefore $a  \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n    Thus, we have found a subbundle $F = \\mathcal{O}(a)$ such that $\\mu(F)  \\mu(E)$. This violates the condition for slope-semistability, so the bundle $E$ is unstable.\n\n    Since $E$ is unstable, it admits a non-trivial Harder-Narasimhan filtration. For a rank-$2$ bundle, this filtration will be of the form $0 = E_0 \\subsetneq E_1 \\subsetneq E_2 = E$.\n    The subbundle $E_1$ in the HN filtration is the unique saturated subbundle of maximal slope. Any line subbundle $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ of $E = \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)$ must have $k \\le a$, because a non-zero homomorphism $\\operatorname{Hom}(\\mathcal{O}(k), \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)) \\neq 0$ requires a non-zero map to at least one of the components, and $\\operatorname{Hom}(\\mathcal{O}(k), \\mathcal{O}(j)) \\neq 0$ only if $j-k \\ge 0$. Since $ab$, the highest possible degree for a line subbundle is $a$. The slope of such a subbundle $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ is $k$. To maximize the slope, we must choose the maximal possible degree, which is $a$.\n    So, we identify $E_1$ with the subbundle $\\mathcal{O}(a)$. We must verify that $E_1$ is a saturated subbundle. A subbundle is saturated if the quotient $E/E_1$ is torsion-free. In this case, the quotient is $E/E_1 = (\\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b))/\\mathcal{O}(a) \\cong \\mathcal{O}(b)$. Since $\\mathcal{O}(b)$ is a line bundle, it is locally free and therefore torsion-free. Thus, $E_1 = \\mathcal{O}(a)$ is a saturated subbundle.\n\n    The Harder-Narasimhan filtration of $E$ is therefore:\n    $$0 = E_0 \\subset E_1 = \\mathcal{O}(a) \\subset E_2 = \\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b)$$\n\n3.  **Identification of Graded Quotients and Slopes**:\n    The graded quotients (or HN factors) of this filtration are:\n    $Q_1 = E_1/E_0 = E_1 = \\mathcal{O}(a)$.\n    $Q_2 = E_2/E_1 = (\\mathcal{O}(a)\\oplus\\mathcal{O}(b))/\\mathcal{O}(a) \\cong \\mathcal{O}(b)$.\n\n    Both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are line bundles. A line bundle is always stable, and therefore also semistable.\n    The slopes of these quotients are:\n    $\\mu_1 = \\mu(Q_1) = \\mu(\\mathcal{O}(a)) = \\frac{\\deg(\\mathcal{O}(a))}{\\operatorname{rk}(\\mathcal{O}(a))} = \\frac{a}{1} = a$.\n    $\\mu_2 = \\mu(Q_2) = \\mu(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = \\frac{\\deg(\\mathcal{O}(b))}{\\operatorname{rk}(\\mathcal{O}(b))} = \\frac{b}{1} = b$.\n\n    The condition for the HN filtration is that the slopes of the quotients must be strictly decreasing. Indeed, we have $\\mu_1 = a$ and $\\mu_2 = b$, and we are given $a  b$, so $\\mu_1  \\mu_2$. This confirms that we have correctly identified the HN filtration.\n    The corresponding Harder-Narasimhan slope vector for $E$ is $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2)$.\n\n4.  **Implications for the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau Correspondence**:\n    The Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem states that a holomorphic vector bundle admits a Hermitian-Einstein metric if and only if it is **polystable**. A bundle is polystable if it is a direct sum of stable bundles, all of which have the same slope.\n    The bundle in question is $E = \\mathcal{O}(a) \\oplus \\mathcal{O}(b)$. It is a direct sum of $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(b)$. As line bundles, $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(b)$ are stable. However, for $E$ to be polystable, its stable summands must have the same slope.\n    The slopes are $\\mu(\\mathcal{O}(a)) = a$ and $\\mu(\\mathcal{O}(b)) = b$.\n    Since $a  b$, the slopes are unequal. Therefore, $E$ is not a polystable bundle.\n    According to the DUY correspondence, because $E$ is not polystable, it cannot admit a Hermitian-Einstein metric.\n    Our explicit computation of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration serves as the definitive proof of this conclusion. The existence of a non-trivial HN filtration (i.e., one where the graded pieces are proper subquotients) with strictly decreasing slopes demonstrates that the bundle is unstable. An unstable bundle cannot be polystable, as polystability implies semistability. The fact that $\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$ is the direct contradiction to the polystability condition.\n\nThe Harder-Narasimhan slope vector of $E$ is $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2)=(a,b)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na  b\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3034918"}]}
