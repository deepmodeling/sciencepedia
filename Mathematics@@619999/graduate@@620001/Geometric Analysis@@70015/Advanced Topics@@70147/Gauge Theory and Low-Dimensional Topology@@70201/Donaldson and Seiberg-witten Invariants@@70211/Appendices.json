The cellular chain complex with integer coefficients $C_{\\bullet}(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ is therefore:\n$$\nC_{k}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\begin{cases} \\mathbb{Z} & k \\in \\{0, 2, 4\\} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe boundary maps $\\partial_{k}: C_{k} \\to C_{k-1}$ are all zero. This is because all cells are in even dimensions, so the target of any boundary map, $C_{k-1}$, is the zero group. Consequently, the homology groups are isomorphic to the chain groups: $H_{k}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong C_{k}(X;\\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe homology groups are:\n$H_{0}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n$H_{1}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n$H_{2}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n$H_{3}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n$H_{4}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\nThe Betti numbers $b_{i}(X) = \\text{rank}(H_{i}(X;\\mathbb{Z}))$ are therefore:\n$b_{0}(X) = 1$, $b_{1}(X) = 0$, $b_{2}(X) = 1$, $b_{3}(X) = 0$, $b_{4}(X) = 1$.\nSince $H_{2}(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free, $H^{2}(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_{2}(X;\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The intersection form $Q_{X}$ is a bilinear form on $H^{2}(X;\\mathbb{Z})$. Let $h \\in H^{2}(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ be a generator, which can be taken as the Poincaré dual of the homology class of a complex line $\\mathbb{CP}^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^{2}$. The intersection form is determined by the self-intersection number of this generator.\n$$\nQ_{X}(h,h) = \\langle h \\cup h, [X] \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $[X] \\in H_{4}(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ is the fundamental class.

With respect to the basis $\\{h\\}$, the intersection form $Q_{X}$ is represented by the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[1]$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of $Y=\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\times \\mathbb{S}^{2}$**\n\nWe use the Künneth theorem for homology with integer coefficients, which for a product $A \\times B$ states:\n$$\nH_{k}(A \\times B; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=k} (H_{p}(A;\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes H_{q}(B;\\mathbb{Z})) \\oplus \\bigoplus_{p+q=k-1} \\text{Tor}_1^{\\mathbb{Z}}(H_{p}(A;\\mathbb{Z}), H_{q}(B;\\mathbb{Z}))\n$$\nThe homology of the $2$-sphere, $\\mathbb{S}^{2}$, is $H_{0}(\\mathbb{S}^{2};\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_{1}(\\mathbb{S}^{2};\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$, and $H_{2}(\\mathbb{S}^{2};\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.

So $b_{4}(Y)=1$.\nThe Betti numbers are: $b_{0}(Y)=1$, $b_{1}(Y)=0$, $b_{2}(Y)=2$, $b_{3}(Y)=0$, $b_{4}(Y)=1$.\nThe second cohomology group is $H^{2}(Y;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. A natural basis is given by pulling back the generator of $H^{2}(\\mathbb{S}^{2};\\mathbb{Z})$ via the two projections $\\pi_{1}, \\pi_{2}: Y \\to \\mathbb{S}^{2}$. Let $\\alpha \\in H^{2}(\\mathbb{S}^{2};\\mathbb{Z})$ be a generator. Let $u_{1} = \\pi_{1}^{*}(\\alpha)$ and $u_{2} = \\pi_{2}^{*}(\\alpha)$. The intersection form $Q_{Y}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with entries $Q_{ij} = \\langle u_{i} \\cup u_{j}, [Y] \\rangle$.\n$Q_{11} = \\langle u_{1} \\cup u_{1}, [Y] \\rangle = \\langle \\pi_{1}^{*}(\\alpha) \\cup \\pi_{1}^{*}(\\alpha), [Y] \\rangle = \\langle \\pi_{1}^{*}(\\alpha \\cup \\alpha), [Y] \\rangle$. Since $\\alpha \\cup \\alpha \\in H^{4}(\\mathbb{S}^{2};\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, we have $Q_{11}=0$. Geometrically, this corresponds to the fact that the submanifold $\\mathbb{S}^{2} \\times \\{\\text{pt}\\}$ can be displaced from itself.\n$Q_{22} = 0$ by the same reasoning.\n$Q_{12} = \\langle u_{1} \\cup u_{2}, [Y] \\rangle$. This is the intersection number of the submanifolds $S_{1} = \\mathbb{S}^{2} \\times \\{\\text{pt}\\}$ and $S_{2} = \\{\\text{pt}\\} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{2}$, which intersect transversely at a single point with positive orientation. So $Q_{12}=1$.\nBy graded commutativity of the cup product, $u_{2} \\cup u_{1} = u_{1} \\cup u_{2}$, so $Q_{21} = Q_{12} = 1$.\nThe matrix for $Q_{Y}$ in this basis is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Part 3: Effect of Orientation Reversal**\n\nLet $M$ be an oriented $n$-manifold with fundamental class $[M] \\in H_{n}(M;\\mathbb{Z})$. The manifold $-M$ is the same underlying topological space and smooth structure but with the opposite orientation. Its fundamental class is $[-M] = -[M]$. The intersection form is defined by $Q_{M}(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\langle \\alpha \\cup \\beta, [M] \\rangle$ for $\\alpha, \\beta \\in H^{2}(M;\\mathbb{Z})/\\text{torsion}$ (here, $H^2$ is torsion-free). The form for $-M$ is given by evaluation on its fundamental class:\n$$\nQ_{-M}(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\langle \\alpha \\cup \\beta, [-M] \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha \\cup \\beta, -[M] \\rangle = -\\langle \\alpha \\cup \\beta, [M] \\rangle = -Q_{M}(\\alpha, \\beta)\n$$\nThus, the intersection form of the oppositely-oriented manifold is the negative of the original intersection form: $Q_{-M} = -Q_{M}$.\n\n**Part 4: Context with Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten Invariants**\n\nDonaldson's theorem famously states that if a simply connected, closed, smooth $4$-manifold $M$ has a definite intersection form $Q_{M}$ (i.e., positive definite or negative definite), then $Q_{M}$ must be diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{Z}$ to a sum of squares, i.e., isomorphic to $\\bigoplus_{k} (\\pm 1)$. For $X=\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$, we have $b_{1}(X)=0$ (so it is simply connected) and $Q_{X} = [1]$, which is positive definite and diagonalizable. This is consistent with Donaldson's theorem. $Q_{-X} = [-1]$ is negative definite and also diagonalizable. In contrast, there exist definite unimodular forms that are not diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{Z}$, such as the $E_8$ form. Donaldson's theorem implies that no simply connected smooth $4$-manifold can have such an intersection form.\n\nSeiberg-Witten theory associates invariants to smooth $4$-manifolds. The theory is often most straightforwardly applied when $b_{2}^{+}(M) \\gt 1$. If $b_{2}^{+}(M) \\gt 1$ and $b_1(M)+b_2^+(M)$ is odd, the Seiberg-Witten invariant is an integer count of solutions to the monopole equations for a generic metric. For manifolds with $b_{2}^{+}(M)=1$, like $\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ and $\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\times\\mathbb{S}^{2}$, the theory is more subtle. In this case, there are wall-crossing phenomena, and the invariants depend on the choice of chamber in the space of metrics and perturbations. The parity of $b^+(M)$ does not by itself determine applicability, but the distinction between the cases $b^+(M)=1$ and $b^+(M) \\gt 1$ is a crucial structural feature in the theory's formulation and results.\n\n**Part 5: Calculation of S**\n\nWe must compute $S = \\sigma(X) + \\chi(Y) - \\det(Q_{-X}) + b^{+}(Y) - b^{-}(Y)$.\n\n1.  $\\sigma(X)$: The signature $\\sigma(M)=b^{+}(M)-b^{-}(M)$. For $X=\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$, the form $Q_{X}=[1]$ is positive definite. So $b^{+}(X)=1$ and $b^{-}(X)=0$.\n    $\\sigma(X) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n\n2.  $\\chi(Y)$: The Euler characteristic $\\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^{4} (-1)^{i}b_{i}(M)$. For $Y=\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\times\\mathbb{S}^{2}$, the Betti numbers are $1, 0, 2, 0, 1$.\n    $\\chi(Y) = 1 - 0 + 2 - 0 + 1 = 4$.\n\n3.  $\\det(Q_{-X})$: We have $Q_{X}=[1]$. From Part 3, $Q_{-X}=-Q_{X}=-[1]=[-1]$.\n    $\\det(Q_{-X}) = \\det([-1]) = -1$.\n\n4.  $b^{+}(Y), b^{-}(Y)$: These are the dimensions of the maximal positive and negative definite subspaces for $Q_{Y}$. The matrix is $Q_{Y} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. We find the eigenvalues:\n    $$\n    \\det(Q_{Y}-\\lambda I) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 1 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda^{2}-1=0\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$. There is one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue. Thus, $b^{+}(Y)=1$ and $b^{-}(Y)=1$.\n\nNow, we assemble the value of $S$:\n$S = \\sigma(X) + \\chi(Y) - \\det(Q_{-X}) + b^{+}(Y) - b^{-}(Y)$\n$S = (1) + (4) - (-1) + (1) - (1)$\n$S = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 6$.\nThe final value is an exact integer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "3027833"}, {"introduction": "Donaldson theory revolutionized 4-manifold topology by using the moduli space of anti-self-dual (ASD) connections, or \"instantons.\" This exercise explores the prototypical example of an instanton on the 4-sphere, demonstrating the profound link between its analytical definition (the ASD equation) and its topological charge (the second Chern number $c_2$).

Thus, the curvature $F_{A}$ of the connection $A$ is given by:\n$$F_{A} = \\pi^{*} F_{\\mathrm{E}}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to use the conformal invariance of the Hodge star operator on $2$-forms in four dimensions. Let $(M, g)$ be a $4$-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold. If we consider a conformally related metric $g' = \\phi^{2} g$ for some positive function $\\phi$, the Hodge star operator $*_{g'}$ acting on $2$-forms is identical to $*_{g}$. This can be seen from the general transformation law for the Hodge star on $p$-forms in dimension $n$, which is $*_{g'} = \\phi^{n-2p} *_{g}$. For our case, $n=4$ and $p=2$, so the exponent $n-2p = 4 - 2(2) = 0$, which confirms $*_{g'} = *_{g}$.\n\nThe metric $g_{S}$ on $S^{4}$ is related to the Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{E}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ via the conformal map $\\pi$.

For a generic perturbation ensuring transversality, this complex's operator can be understood to decompose into two parts: a part associated with the connection and the gauge symmetry, and a part associated with the spinor field. The total index is the sum of the indices of the operators governing these two parts.\n\nThe problem provides the indices for precisely these two constituent operators:\n1.  The matter part, which involves the spinor fields, is governed by the $\\operatorname{spin}^{c}$ Dirac operator $D_{A}^{+} \\colon \\Gamma(W^{+}) \\to \\Gamma(W^{-})$. This is a complex linear operator. Its contribution to the real dimension of the moduli space is its real index, which is twice its complex index:\n    $$ \\operatorname{ind}_{\\mathbb{R}}(D_{A}^{+}) = 2 \\operatorname{ind}_{\\mathbb{C}}(D_{A}^{+}) $$\n2.  The gauge part, which involves the connection on the determinant line bundle $L$, is related to the operator $d^{+} \\oplus d^{*} \\colon i\\Omega^{1}(X) \\to i\\Omega^{+}(X) \\oplus i\\Omega^{0}(X)$. The index of this operator captures the properties of the anti-self-dual (ASD) equation for the curvature, modulo gauge transformations.\n\nThe total expected dimension of the moduli space is the sum of these two real indices.\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}} = \\operatorname{ind}_{\\mathbb{R}}(D_{A}^{+}) + \\operatorname{ind}_{\\mathbb{R}}(d^{+} \\oplus d^{*}) $$\nWe are given the explicit expressions for these indices:\n$$ \\operatorname{ind}_{\\mathbb{C}}(D_{A}^{+}) = \\frac{1}{8}\\big(c_{1}(L)^{2} - \\sigma(X)\\big) $$\n$$ \\operatorname{ind}_{\\mathbb{R}}(d^{+} \\oplus d^{*}) = -\\big(b^{0}(X) - b^{1}(X) + b^{+}(X)\\big) $$\nSubstituting these into the dimension formula yields:\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{8}\\big(c_{1}(L)^{2} - \\sigma(X)\\big) \\right) - \\big(b^{0}(X) - b^{1}(X) + b^{+}(X)\\big) $$\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(c_{1}(L)^{2} - \\sigma(X)\\big) - \\big(1 - b^{1}(X) + b^{+}(X)\\big) $$\nwhere we have used the fact that $b^{0}(X)=1$ for a connected manifold $X$.\n\nThe problem requires the dimension to be expressed purely in terms of the topological invariants $c_{1}(L)^{2}$, $\\chi(X)$, and $\\sigma(X)$. To eliminate the Betti numbers $b^{1}(X)$ and $b^{+}(X)$, we use the provided topological identity:\n$$ 2\\chi(X) + 3\\sigma(X) = 4\\big(1 - b^{1}(X) + b^{+}(X)\\big) + \\sigma(X) $$\nRearranging this identity to solve for the term $\\big(1 - b^{1}(X) + b^{+}(X)\\big)$:\n$$ 4\\big(1 - b^{1}(X) + b^{+}(X)\\big) = 2\\chi(X) + 2\\sigma(X) $$\n$$ 1 - b^{1}(X) + b^{+}(X) = \\frac{2\\chi(X) + 2\\sigma(X)}{4} = \\frac{\\chi(X) + \\sigma(X)}{2} $$\nNow we substitute this expression back into our formula for $\\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}}$:\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(c_{1}(L)^{2} - \\sigma(X)\\big) - \\frac{\\chi(X) + \\sigma(X)}{2} $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}} = \\frac{c_{1}(L)^{2} - \\sigma(X) - 2\\big(\\chi(X) + \\sigma(X)\\big)}{4} $$\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}} = \\frac{c_{1}(L)^{2} - \\sigma(X) - 2\\chi(X) - 2\\sigma(X)}{4} $$\nThis gives the final closed-form expression for the expected dimension:\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathfrak{s}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(c_{1}(L)^{2} - 2\\chi(X) - 3\\sigma(X)\\big) $$\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the two specified cases.\n\nCase $(\\mathrm{K3})$: $X$ is a $\\mathrm{K3}$ surface.\nThe given values are $c_{1}(L) = 0$, which implies $c_{1}(L)^{2} = 0$, $\\chi(\\mathrm{K3}) = 24$, and $\\sigma(\\mathrm{K3}) = -16$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ d_{\\mathrm{K3}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(0^{2} - 2(24) - 3(-16)\\big) $$\n$$ d_{\\mathrm{K3}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(-48 + 48\\big) = \\frac{1}{4}(0) = 0 $$\nThe expected dimension of the moduli space for a $\\mathrm{K3}$ surface with this $\\operatorname{spin}^{c}$ structure is $0$.\n\nCase $(\\mathbb{CP}^{2})$: $X$ is the complex projective plane $\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$.\nWe use the standard topological invariants for $\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$: the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\mathbb{CP}^{2}) = 3$ and the signature is $\\sigma(\\mathbb{CP}^{2}) = 1$.\nThe first Chern class of the determinant bundle is given as $c_{1}(L) = kH$, where $H$ is the hyperplane class satisfying $H^{2} = 1$ and $k$ is an odd integer. The self-intersection number $c_{1}(L)^{2}$ is computed in cohomology:\n$$ c_{1}(L)^{2} = (kH)^{2} = k^{2}H^{2} = k^{2}(1) = k^{2} $$\nSubstituting these values into the dimension formula:\n$$ d_{\\mathbb{CP}^{2}}(k) = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(k^{2} - 2(3) - 3(1)\\big) $$\n$$ d_{\\mathbb{CP}^{2}}(k) = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(k^{2} - 6 - 3\\big) = \\frac{1}{4}\\big(k^{2} - 9\\big) $$\nThis is the expected dimension for $\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ with the specified $\\operatorname{spin}^{c}$ structure, as a function of the integer $k$. The condition that $k$ is odd ensures that $k^{2}-9$ is divisible by $4$, so the dimension is an integer. Specifically, if $k=2m+1$ for some integer $m$, then $k^2 = 4m^2+4m+1$, so $k^2-9 = 4m^2+4m-8 = 4(m^2+m-2)$, and the dimension is $m^2+m-2$.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of results for the two cases, presented as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{4}(k^{2}-9)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3027828"}]}
