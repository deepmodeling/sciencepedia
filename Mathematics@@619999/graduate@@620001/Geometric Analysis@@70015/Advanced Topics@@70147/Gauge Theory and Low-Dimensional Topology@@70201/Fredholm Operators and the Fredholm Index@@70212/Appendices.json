The inner product is $\\langle x, y \\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k \\overline{y_k}$ and the norm is $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x \\rangle}$.\n\n**1. Construction of the Operator**\nWe define the operator $T: \\ell^{2} \\to \\ell^{2}$ as the unilateral right shift operator, which we will denote by $S$. For any sequence $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots) \\in \\ell^{2}$, its action is given by:\n$$S(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots) = (0, x_1, x_2, \\dots)$$\n\n**2. Verification of Properties**\n\n**A. Bounded Linear Operator**\n- **Linearity**: Let $x, y \\in \\ell^{2}$ and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n$$S(\\alpha x + \\beta y) = S(\\alpha x_1 + \\beta y_1, \\alpha x_2 + \\beta y_2, \\dots)$$\n$$= (0, \\alpha x_1 + \\beta y_1, \\alpha x_2 + \\beta y_2, \\dots)$$\n$$= (0, \\alpha x_1, \\alpha x_2, \\dots) + (0, \\beta y_1, \\beta y_2, \\dots)$$\n$$= \\alpha(0, x_1, x_2, \\dots) + \\beta(0, y_1, y_2, \\dots) = \\alpha S(x) + \\beta S(y)$$\nThus, $S$ is a linear operator.\n- **Boundedness**: We compute the norm of $S(x)$:\n$$\\|S(x)\\|^{2} = |0|^{2} + |x_1|^{2} + |x_2|^{2} + \\dots = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |x_k|^{2} = \\|x\\|^{2}$$\nThis shows that $\\|S(x)\\| = \\|x\\|$ for all $x \\in \\ell^{2}$. The operator norm is $\\|S\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|=1} \\|S(x)\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|=1} \\|x\\| = 1$. Since the norm is finite, $S$ is a bounded operator.\n\n**B. Not a Compact Operator**\nA linear operator $K$ on a Banach space is compact if for every bounded sequence $(x_n)$, the sequence $(Kx_n)$ contains a convergent subsequence.\nLet $\\{e_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be the standard orthonormal basis for $\\ell^{2}$, where $e_n$ is the sequence with a $1$ in the $n$-th position and $0$s elsewhere. The sequence $(e_n)$ is bounded, as $\\|e_n\\| = 1$ for all $n$.\nLet us examine the sequence $(Se_n)$:\n$$S(e_n) = e_{n+1}$$\nThe sequence of images is $(Se_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} = (e_2, e_3, e_4, \\dots)$. This is an orthonormal sequence. For any two distinct terms $Se_n = e_{n+1}$ and $Se_m = e_{m+1}$ with $n \\neq m$, we have:\n$$\\|Se_n - Se_m\\|^{2} = \\|e_{n+1} - e_{m+1}\\|^{2} = \\langle e_{n+1} - e_{m+1}, e_{n+1} - e_{m+1} \\rangle$$\n$$= \\|e_{n+1}\\|^{2} - \\langle e_{n+1}, e_{m+1} \\rangle - \\langle e_{m+1}, e_{n+1} \\rangle + \\|e_{m+1}\\|^{2}$$\nSince the basis is orthonormal, $\\langle e_{j}, e_{k} \\rangle = \\delta_{jk}$, so $\\langle e_{n+1}, e_{m+1} \\rangle = 0$.\n$$\\|Se_n - Se_m\\|^{2} = 1^{2} - 0 - 0 + 1^{2} = 2$$\nTherefore, $\\|Se_n - Se_m\\| = \\sqrt{2}$ for all $n \\neq m$.\nA sequence $(y_n)$ can only contain a convergent subsequence if it contains a Cauchy subsequence. The sequence $(Se_n)$ cannot contain a Cauchy subsequence because the distance between any two distinct terms is fixed at $\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $(Se_n)$ has no convergent subsequence.\nSince we found a bounded sequence $(e_n)$ for which the image sequence $(Se_n)$ has no convergent subsequence, the operator $S$ is not compact.\n\n**C. Fredholm Operator**\nAn operator $T$ is Fredholm if its kernel is finite-dimensional, its range is closed, and its cokernel is finite-dimensional.\n- **Kernel of S**: The kernel of $S$ is the set $\\ker(S) = \\{x \\in \\ell^{2} \\mid S(x) = 0\\}$.\n$$S(x) = (0, x_1, x_2, \\dots) = (0, 0, 0, \\dots)$$\nThis implies that $x_k = 0$ for all $k \\geq 1$. Therefore, $x$ must be the zero vector.\n$$\\ker(S) = \\{0\\}$$\nThe dimension of the kernel is $\\dim(\\ker(S)) = 0$, which is finite.\n\n- **Range of S and its closure**: The range of $S$ is the set $\\text{ran}(S) = \\{y \\in \\ell^{2} \\mid y = S(x) \\text{ for some } x \\in \\ell^{2}\\}$.\nFrom the definition of $S$, any vector $y \\in \\text{ran}(S)$ must have its first component equal to $0$. Let's denote the first component of $y$ by $y_1$.\n$$\\text{ran}(S) = \\{y = (y_1, y_2, \\dots) \\in \\ell^{2} \\mid y_1 = 0\\}$$\nTo show this subspace is closed, let $(y^{(n)})$ be a sequence in $\\text{ran}(S)$ that converges to a limit $y \\in \\ell^{2}$. For each $n$, $y^{(n)}_1 = 0$. Since convergence in $\\ell^{2}$ implies coordinate-wise convergence, we have $y_1 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^{(n)}_1 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0$. Thus, the limit vector $y$ has its first component equal to $0$, which means $y \\in \\text{ran}(S)$. Therefore, $\\text{ran}(S)$ is a closed subspace of $\\ell^{2}$.\n\n- **Cokernel of S**: The cokernel of $S$ is the quotient space $\\text{coker}(S) = \\ell^{2} / \\text{ran}(S)$. The dimension of the cokernel is the codimension of the range. For a closed subspace $M$ of a Hilbert space $H$, we have the isomorphism $H/M \\cong M^{\\perp}$, where $M^{\\perp}$ is the orthogonal complement of $M$.\nThus, $\\dim(\\text{coker}(S)) = \\dim((\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp})$.\nLet's find the orthogonal complement of $\\text{ran}(S)$. A vector $z = (z_1, z_2, \\dots) \\in \\ell^{2}$ is in $(\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp}$ if and only if $\\langle z, y \\rangle = 0$ for all $y \\in \\text{ran}(S)$.\nFor any $k \\geq 2$, the basis vector $e_k$ is in $\\text{ran}(S)$ since $e_k = S(e_{k-1})$. Therefore, for $z \\in (\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp}$, we must have:\n$$\\langle z, e_k \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\geq 2$$\nThe inner product gives $\\langle z, e_k \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} z_j \\overline{(e_k)_j} = z_k$.\nSo, we must have $z_k = 0$ for all $k \\geq 2$. This means $z$ must be of the form $(z_1, 0, 0, \\dots) = z_1 e_1$.\n$$(\\text{ran}(S))^{\\perp} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$$\nThe dimension of this subspace is $1$.\n$$\\dim(\\text{coker}(S)) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{e_1\\}) = 1$$\nThis dimension is finite.\n\nSince $\\dim(\\ker(S))=0$, $\\text{ran}(S)$ is closed, and $\\dim(\\text{coker}(S))=1$, the operator $S$ is a Fredholm operator by definition.\n\n**3. Computation of the Fredholm Index**\nThe Fredholm index of an operator $T$ is defined as:\n$$\\text{ind}(T) = \\dim(\\ker(T)) - \\dim(\\text{coker}(T))$$\nFor our operator $S$, we have found $\\dim(\\ker(S))=0$ and $\\dim(\\text{coker}(S))=1$.\n$$\\text{ind}(S) = 0 - 1 = -1$$\nThe Fredholm index of the right shift operator is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3028097"}, {"introduction": "A powerful perspective in Fredholm theory is that Fredholm operators are precisely those that are invertible \"up to compact operators,\" i.e., invertible in the Calkin algebra.

As suggested by the problem, we propose the candidate parametrix $Q = T_{\\overline{B}}$, where $\\overline{B}$ is the complex conjugate of the symbol $B$. To verify that $Q$ is a parametrix for $T_B$, we must show that the operators $Q T_B - I$ and $T_B Q - I$ are compact operators on $H^2(\\mathbb{T})$. We will use the notation $H^2$ for $H^2(\\mathbb{T})$ and $L^2$ for $L^2(\\mathbb{T})$.\n\nThe symbol $B(z)$ is a finite Blaschke product. By construction, it is analytic in the open unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ and continuous on its closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{D}}$. Thus, $B \\in H^\\infty(\\mathbb{D})$, the algebra of bounded analytic functions on $\\mathbb{D}$. The boundary function of $B$ on the unit circle $\\mathbb{T}$ is also in $H^\\infty(\\mathbb{T})$, viewed as a subspace of $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{T})$. For any symbol $\\varphi \\in H^\\infty$, the action of the Toeplitz operator $T_\\varphi$ on any function $f \\in H^2$ is simply multiplication: $T_\\varphi f = P(M_\\varphi f) = P(\\varphi f) = \\varphi f$, since the product $\\varphi f$ is also in $H^2$ and the Szegő projection $P$ acts as the identity on $H^2$. Therefore, $T_B$ is the operator of multiplication by $B$ on $H^2$, i.e., $T_B = M_B|_{H^2}$.\n\nA key property of a Blaschke product $B$ is that it is an inner function. This means that its boundary values on $\\mathbb{T}$ have modulus $1$ almost everywhere, i.e., $|B(z)| = 1$ for a.e. $z \\in \\mathbb{T}$. This implies that $B(z)\\overline{B(z)} = |B(z)|^2 = 1$ a.e. on $\\mathbb{T}$.\n\nLet us now analyze the first remainder, $T_{\\overline{B}} T_B - I$.\nThe adjoint of a Toeplitz operator $T_\\varphi$ is given by $T_\\varphi^* = T_{\\overline{\\varphi}}$. Consequently, $T_B^* = T_{\\overline{B}}$.\nThe operator $T_B = M_B|_{H^2}$ is an isometry on $H^2$. This is because for any $f \\in H^2$,\n$$\n\\|T_B f\\|^2_{H^2} = \\|Bf\\|^2_{H^2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} |B(z)f(z)|^2 \\frac{|dz|}{2\\pi} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} |B(z)|^2 |f(z)|^2 \\frac{|dz|}{2\\pi} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} |f(z)|^2 \\frac{|dz|}{2\\pi} = \\|f\\|^2_{H^2}.\n$$\nAn operator $U$ is an isometry if and only if $U^*U = I$. Applying this to $T_B$, we get $T_B^* T_B = I$. Substituting $T_B^* = T_{\\overline{B}}$, we have $T_{\\overline{B}} T_B = I$.\nThus, the first remainder is $T_{\\overline{B}} T_B - I = I - I = 0$. The zero operator is a finite-rank operator (of rank $0$) and is therefore compact.\n\nNext, we analyze the second remainder, $T_B T_{\\overline{B}} - I$.\nUsing $T_{\\overline{B}} = T_B^*$, this expression is $T_B T_B^* - I$. For any bounded linear operator $A$ on a Hilbert space, the operator $A A^*$ is the orthogonal projection onto the closure of the range of $A$, denoted $P_{\\overline{\\mathrm{ran}(A)}}$.\nIn our case, the range of $T_B$ is $\\mathrm{ran}(T_B) = \\{Bf : f \\in H^2\\} = B H^2$. Since $T_B$ is an isometry, its range $B H^2$ is a closed subspace of $H^2$.\nTherefore, $T_B T_{\\overline{B}} = T_B T_B^* = P_{B H^2}$, the orthogonal projection from $H^2$ onto the subspace $B H^2$.\nThe identity operator $I$ on $H^2$ can be decomposed with respect to the subspace $B H^2$ and its orthogonal complement in $H^2$, which is denoted $H^2 \\ominus B H^2$. This decomposition is $I = P_{B H^2} + P_{H^2 \\ominus B H^2}$.\nThen, the second remainder is\n$$\nT_B T_{\\overline{B}} - I = P_{B H^2} - (P_{B H^2} + P_{H^2 \\ominus B H^2}) = -P_{H^2 \\ominus B H^2}.\n$$\nThis is the negative of the projection onto the subspace $H^2 \\ominus B H^2$. By a fundamental result in Hardy space theory (a part of Beurling's theorem), for an inner function $\\phi$, the dimension of the subspace $H^2 \\ominus \\phi H^2$ is equal to the number of zeros of $\\phi$ in the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$, counted with their multiplicities.\nThe given Blaschke product is\n$$\nB(z) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\cdot z^1 \\cdot \\frac{z - \\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}z} \\cdot \\frac{z - \\frac{i}{3}}{1 + \\frac{i}{3}z}.\n$$\nThe zeros of $B(z)$ inside $\\mathbb{D}$ are at $z_1 = 0$, $z_2 = 1/2$, and $z_3 = i/3$. All are of multiplicity $1$. The degree of the Blaschke product, which is the total number of zeros, is $3$.\nTherefore, $\\dim(H^2 \\ominus B H^2) = 3$.\nThe operator $P_{H^2 \\ominus B H^2}$ is a projection onto a $3$-dimensional space, making it a rank-$3$ operator. Any finite-rank operator is compact. Thus, $T_B T_{\\overline{B}} - I$ is a compact operator.\n\nSince both $T_{\\overline{B}} T_B - I$ and $T_B T_{\\overline{B}} - I$ are compact, $Q=T_{\\overline{B}}$ is a parametrix for $T_B$. An operator that has a parametrix is, by definition, a Fredholm operator.\n\nNow we compute the Fredholm index, $\\mathrm{ind}(T_B) = \\dim(\\ker T_B) - \\dim(\\mathrm{coker}\\, T_B)$.\nFirst, we find the dimension of the kernel, $\\ker T_B$.\n$f \\in \\ker T_B$ if and only if $f \\in H^2$ and $T_B f = 0$. Since $T_B = M_B|_{H^2}$, this means $Bf = 0$. As $T_B$ is an isometry, it is injective. Thus, $Bf = 0$ implies $f=0$. So, $\\ker T_B = \\{0\\}$ and $\\dim(\\ker T_B) = 0$.\n\nSecond, we find the dimension of the cokernel. The cokernel of $T_B$ is defined as the quotient space $\\mathrm{coker}\\, T_B = H^2 / \\mathrm{ran}(T_B)$. Its dimension is given by the dimension of the orthogonal complement of the range, $\\dim(\\mathrm{coker}\\, T_B) = \\dim((\\mathrm{ran}(T_B))^\\perp)$.\nThe range of $T_B$ is the subspace $B H^2$. The orthogonal complement of $\\mathrm{ran}(T_B) = B H^2$ within the codomain $H^2$ is precisely the subspace $H^2 \\ominus B H^2$.\nSo, we have $\\dim(\\mathrm{coker}\\, T_B) = \\dim(H^2 \\ominus B H^2)$. As we established earlier, this dimension is the degree of the Blaschke product $B$, which is $3$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Fredholm index:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ind}(T_B) = \\dim(\\ker T_B) - \\dim(\\mathrm{coker}\\, T_B) = 0 - 3 = -3.\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the general theorem for Toeplitz operators with inner function symbols, which states that $\\mathrm{ind}(T_\\phi) = -\\deg(\\phi)$, where $\\deg(\\phi)$ is the number of zeros of $\\phi$ in $\\mathbb{D}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-3}\n$$", "id": "3028110"}, {"introduction": "The analysis of elliptic operators on non-compact manifolds is a cornerstone of modern geometric analysis, where the Fredholm property often depends on the asymptotic behavior of functions at infinity.

However, for an operator on a manifold $M = K \\cup ([0, \\infty) \\times Y)$, the requirement that sections be smooth over the entire manifold (and thus extend smoothly from the cylinder into the compact part $K$) imposes constraints.\n\nA fundamental result of the theory is that for an operator of the form $D=\\partial_t+A$, the dimension of the cokernel $\\mathrm{coker}(D_\\delta)$ remains constant as $\\delta$ crosses an eigenvalue of $A$. This is because solutions to the formal adjoint equation that decay at infinity cannot be smoothly extended to the compact part $K$, and thus do not correspond to elements in $\\ker(D_\\delta^*)$. Therefore, as $\\delta$ crosses $\\lambda_3$, no new elements are added to or removed from the cokernel.\n$$\n\\Delta(\\dim \\mathrm{coker}) = \\dim \\mathrm{coker}(D_{\\delta_{+}}) - \\dim \\mathrm{coker}(D_{\\delta_{-}}) = 0\n$$\n\n**Index Jump Calculation**\n\nThe change in the Fredholm index is the difference between the change in the kernel dimension and the change in the cokernel dimension.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{+}}) - \\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{-}}) = \\Delta(\\dim \\ker) - \\Delta(\\dim \\mathrm{coker})\n$$\nSubstituting the changes we found:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{+}}) - \\mathrm{Ind}(D_{\\delta_{-}}) = (-m_3) - 0 = -m_3\n$$\nThis is the general index jump formula for an operator of type $\\partial_t + A$. As the weight $\\delta$ increases across an eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$ of multiplicity $m_0$, the index decreases by $m_0$.\n\nIn this specific problem, the weight $\\delta$ increases from $\\delta_{-} = 2.6$ to $\\delta_{+} = 3.4$, crossing the single eigenvalue $\\lambda_3 = 3$ which has multiplicity $m_3 = 4$.\nTherefore, the index jump is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ind}(D_{3.4}) - \\mathrm{Ind}(D_{2.6}) = -m_3 = -4\n$$\nThe jump is directly related to the dimension of the space of extended solutions corresponding to the eigenvalue being crossed, which is $m_3 = 4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-4}\n$$", "id": "3028106"}]}
