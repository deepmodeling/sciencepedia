Let $(X, \\omega)$ be a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension $n$. For a holomorphic vector bundle $F \\to X$ of rank $r$ with a Hermitian metric, let $F_F$ be the curvature two-form of the induced Chern connection.\n\nThe $k$-th Chern class of $F$, denoted $c_k(F)$, is represented in de Rham cohomology by the real $2k$-form given by the polynomial in the curvature matrix $\\frac{i}{2\\pi}F_F$.

Its curvature is a single two-form $F_L$. The first Chern form of $L$ is\n    $$\n    c_1(L) = \\frac{i}{2\\pi} F_L\n    $$\n    We are given the condition $i F_L = \\lambda \\omega$, where $\\lambda$ is a real constant.

Thus,\n    $$\n    \\det(E) = L \\otimes L = L^{\\otimes 2}\n    $$\n    The degree of a tensor product of line bundles is the sum of their degrees:\n    $$\n    \\text{deg}(E) = \\text{deg}(L^{\\otimes 2}) = \\text{deg}(L) + \\text{deg}(L) = 2 \\cdot \\text{deg}(L)\n    $$\n    Substituting the previously calculated degree of $L$, we get\n    $$\n    \\text{deg}(E) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\lambda A}{\\pi}\n    $$\n    The slope of $E$ is then\n    $$\n    \\mu(E) = \\frac{\\text{deg}(E)}{\\text{rank}(E)} = \\frac{\\lambda A / \\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Identify natural subbundles and their slopes**:\n    The direct-sum decomposition $E = L \\oplus L$ gives rise to two natural rank-$1$ holomorphic subbundles.

We have found proper rank-$1$ subbundles $S \\subset E$ for which\n    $$\n    \\mu(S) = \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu(E) = \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi}\n    $$\n    Thus, we have $\\mu(S) = \\mu(E)$.\n\n    -   **Semistability**: The condition for semistability is that for any proper subbundle $S' \\subset E$, $\\mu(S') \\leq \\mu(E)$. It is a standard result that for any rank-$1$ subbundle $S' \\subset L \\oplus L$, its degree must satisfy $\\text{deg}(S') \\leq \\text{deg}(L)$. This implies $\\mu(S') \\leq \\mu(L)$. Since $\\mu(L) = \\mu(E)$, the condition $\\mu(S') \\leq \\mu(E)$ holds for all rank-$1$ subbundles. Thus, $E$ is **semistable**.\n\n    -   **Stability**: The condition for stability is that for any proper subbundle $S' \\subset E$, the strict inequality $\\mu(S') < \\mu(E)$ must hold. We have found subbundles, namely the direct summands $S_1$ and $S_2$, for which $\\mu(S_1) = \\mu(S_2) = \\mu(E)$. Since the equality holds, the strict inequality required for stability is violated. Therefore, $E$ is **not stable**.\n\nThe vector bundle $E$ is an example of a strictly semistable (or polystable) bundle, which is a direct sum of stable bundles of the same slope.\n\nThe final request is to provide the slopes $\\mu(E)$, and the slopes of the two natural rank-$1$ subbundles, which are both $\\mu(L)$.\nWe have calculated:\n$\\mu(E) = \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi}$\n$\\mu(L) = \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi}$\nThe slopes are all equal.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi} & \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi} & \\frac{\\lambda A}{2\\pi}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3030367"}, {"introduction": "Moving from Riemann surfaces to higher-dimensional Kähler manifolds like complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the HYM equation, $\\sqrt{-1}\\Lambda_{\\omega}F_A = \\mu I$, involves the contraction operator $\\Lambda_{\\omega}$.
