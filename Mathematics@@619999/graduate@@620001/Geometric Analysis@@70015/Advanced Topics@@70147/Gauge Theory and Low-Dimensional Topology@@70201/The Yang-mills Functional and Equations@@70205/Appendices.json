The analysis will proceed in three steps as outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we begin by stating the general Yang–Mills equation. The Yang–Mills functional for a connection $A$, which is a $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued $1$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, is given by\n$$\n\\operatorname{YM}(A) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} |F_{A}|^{2}\\, dx,\n$$\nwhere $F_A = dA + A \\wedge A$ is the curvature $2$-form. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional, which defines a critical point (a Yang-Mills connection), is found by considering the variation of $\\operatorname{YM}(A)$ with respect to a compactly supported $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued $1$-form $\\eta$. A connection $A$ is a Yang-Mills connection if it satisfies the equation\n$$\nd_A^* F_A = 0,\n$$\nwhere $d_A^*$ is the formal adjoint of the covariant exterior derivative $d_A = d + [A, \\cdot]$. For the trivial bundle over $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this adjoint is given by $d_A^* = d^* \\mp *[A, *\\cdot]$, where the sign depends on conventions and the degree of the form acted upon. Specifically, for a $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued $2$-form like $F_A$, the Yang-Mills equation is $d^* F_A + *[A, *F_A] = 0$.\n\n1. Linearization of the Yang–Mills equation at the flat connection $A=0$.\n\nWe consider a variation around the flat connection $A=0$ of the form $A_t = t a$, where $a$ is a fixed smooth $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued $1$-form and $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a small parameter. We substitute this into the Yang-Mills equation $d_{A_t}^* F_{A_t} = 0$ and extract the leading-order term in $t$.\n\nThe curvature of the connection $A_t = ta$ is\n$$\nF_{A_t} = d(ta) + (ta) \\wedge (ta) = t(da) + t^2(a \\wedge a).\n$$\nThe Yang-Mills equation for $A_t$ is $d_{ta}^* F_{A_t} = 0$. Using the expression for the adjoint covariant derivative, this is\n$$\nd^* F_{A_t} + *[ta, *F_{A_t}] = 0.\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{A_t}$:\n$$\nd^*(t(da) + t^2(a \\wedge a)) + *[ta, *(t(da) + t^2(a \\wedge a))] = 0.\n$$\nWe expand this equation in powers of $t$:\n$$\nt(d^*da) + t^2(d^*(a \\wedge a)) + t^2(*[a, *da]) + t^3(*[a, *(a \\wedge a)]) = 0.\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for all small $t$, the coefficient of each power of $t$ must vanish. The leading-order term is the term linear in $t$. Its coefficient gives the linearized Yang-Mills equation:\n$$\nd^*da = 0.\n$$\nThe problem then requires imposing the Coulomb gauge condition, $d^*a = 0$. The resulting linear system for the $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued $1$-form $a$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nd^*da = 0 \\\\\nd^*a = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n2. Identification of solutions with divergence-free harmonic $1$-forms.\n\nWe are asked to show that the system derived above characterizes $a$ as a \"divergence-free harmonic $1$-form\". The term \"divergence-free\" corresponds to the condition $d^*a=0$, where $d^*$ is the Hodge codifferential, which acts as the divergence operator on $1$-forms (dual to vector fields). A $1$-form $a$ is called harmonic if it is annihilated by the Hodge Laplacian, $\\Delta a = 0$.\n\nThe Hodge Laplacian on $k$-forms on a Riemannian manifold is defined as $\\Delta = dd^* + d^*d$. For the $1$-form $a$, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta a = (dd^* + d^*d)a = d(d^*a) + d^*da.\n$$\nWe now check the implications of the linear system from part 1:\nThe second equation of the system is the Coulomb gauge condition, $d^*a=0$. Substituting this into the first term of the Laplacian expression yields:\n$$\nd(d^*a) = d(0) = 0.\n$$\nThe first equation of the system is the linearized Yang-Mills equation, $d^*da=0$. This is precisely the second term in the aformentioned expression for the Laplacian.\n\nCombining these two results, if $a$ is a solution to the system, then\n$$\n\\Delta a = d(d^*a) + d^*da = 0 + 0 = 0.\n$$\nThus, any solution $a$ to the system is a harmonic $1$-form. Since it also satisfies $d^*a=0$, it is a divergence-free (or co-closed) harmonic $1$-form. This completes the explanation.\n\n3. Dimension of the space of $L^2$ solutions.\n\nWe need to find the dimension of the real vector space of solutions to the system\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nd^*da = 0 \\\\\nd^*a = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nsubject to the additional condition that $a$ is square-integrable, i.e., $a \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{n}; T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\otimes \\mathfrak{g})$.\nAs established in part 2, this system implies that $\\Delta a = 0$. So we are seeking the dimension of the space of $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued, $L^2$ harmonic $1$-forms on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nWe use the Fourier transform, as suggested. Let $\\hat{a}(\\xi)$ denote the Fourier transform of $a(x)$. Since $a$ is $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued, its components $a_\\mu$ are $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued functions, and the Fourier transform is applied component-wise. The action of differential operators on $a$ is transformed into multiplication by polynomials in the frequency variable $\\xi$ on $\\hat{a}$.\nThe symbol of the Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta$ is $-|\\xi|^2 = -(\\xi_1^2 + \\dots + \\xi_n^2)$. Thus, the equation $\\Delta a = 0$ in the sense of distributions becomes in Fourier space:\n$$\n-|\\xi|^2 \\hat{a}(\\xi) = 0.\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. For any $\\xi \\neq 0$, we have $|\\xi|^2 \\neq 0$. This implies that we must have $\\hat{a}(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi \\neq 0$. This means that the support of the distribution $\\hat{a}$ is contained in the set $\\{\\xi=0\\}$, which has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nNow, we impose the condition that $a \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$. By Plancherel's theorem, the Fourier transform is an isometry on $L^2$ spaces (up to a constant factor depending on convention), so $a \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ if and only if $\\hat{a} \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. This means:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |\\hat{a}(\\xi)|^2 d\\xi < \\infty.\n$$\nAn $L^2$ function whose support is a set of measure zero must be the zero function almost everywhere. Since $\\text{supp}(\\hat{a}) \\subseteq \\{0\\}$, it follows that $\\hat{a}(\\xi) = 0$ for almost every $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. As an element of the Hilbert space $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, this means $\\hat{a}$ is the zero vector.\n\nSince the Fourier transform is an isomorphism from $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ to itself, if $\\hat{a}=0$ in $L^2$, then its inverse Fourier transform $a$ must also be the zero vector in $L^2$. This holds for each component of the $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued $1$-form $a$.\nTherefore, the only $L^2$ solution to the linearized Yang-Mills equations in the Coulomb gauge is the trivial solution $a=0$.\n\nThe space of such solutions is the trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$.

The term $da + [A \\wedge a]$ is the covariant exterior derivative of $a$ with respect to $A$, denoted $d_A a$.\nThus, we have the expansion of the curvature in powers of $t$:\n$$\nF_{A_t} = F_A + t \\, d_A a + \\frac{t^2}{2} [a \\wedge a].\n$$\nNow, we compute the norm squared of $F_{A_t}$:\n\\begin{align*} |F_{A_t}|^2 &= \\langle F_{A_t}, F_{A_t} \\rangle \\\\ &= \\left\\langle F_A + t \\, d_A a + \\frac{t^2}{2} [a \\wedge a], F_A + t \\, d_A a + \\frac{t^2}{2} [a \\wedge a] \\right\\rangle \\\\ &= \\langle F_A, F_A \\rangle + 2t \\langle F_A, d_A a \\rangle + t^2 \\left( \\langle d_A a, d_A a \\rangle + \\langle F_A, [a \\wedge a] \\rangle \\right) + O(t^3) \\\\ &= |F_A|^2 + 2t \\langle F_A, d_A a \\rangle + t^2 \\left( |d_A a|^2 + \\langle F_A, [a \\wedge a] \\rangle \\right) + O(t^3). \\end{align*}\nThe Yang–Mills functional for $A_t$ is then\n$$\n\\mathcal{YM}(A_t) = \\mathcal{YM}(A) + t \\int_{M} \\langle F_A, d_A a \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} + \\frac{t^2}{2} \\int_{M} \\left( |d_A a|^2 + \\langle F_A, [a \\wedge a] \\rangle \\right) \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} + O(t^3).\n$$\nThe first variation is the coefficient of $t$:\n$$\n\\delta\\mathcal{YM}(A)[a] = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\mathcal{YM}(A_t) = \\int_{M} \\langle F_A, d_A a \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}.\n$$\nUsing integration by parts (which is valid since $M$ is compact) and the definition of the formal adjoint $d_A^*$, we have\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\langle F_A, d_A a \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} = \\int_{M} \\langle d_A^* F_A, a \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}.\n$$\nSince $A$ is a Yang–Mills connection, it is a critical point of $\\mathcal{YM}$, so it satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equation $d_A^* F_A = 0$. Consequently, the first variation vanishes, as expected.\n\nThe second variation is obtained by differentiating twice with respect to $t$ and setting $t=0$:\n$$\n\\delta^2\\mathcal{YM}(A)[a,a] = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\mathcal{YM}(A_t) = \\int_{M} \\left( |d_A a|^2 + \\langle F_A, [a \\wedge a] \\rangle \\right) \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}.\n$$\nOur goal is to write this in the form $\\int_{M} \\langle a, L_A a \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}$. We analyze each term in the integrand separately.\n\nThe first term, $|d_A a|^2 = \\langle d_A a, d_A a \\rangle$, can be transformed using integration by parts:\n$$\n\\int_{M} |d_A a|^2 \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} = \\int_{M} \\langle d_A a, d_A a \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g} = \\int_{M} \\langle a, d_A^{*} d_A a \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}.\n$$\nThe second term, $\\langle F_A, [a \\wedge a] \\rangle$, needs to be expressed as an inner product with $a$. Let's work in a local $g$-orthonormal frame $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ with dual coframe $\\{e^i\\}_{i=1}^n$. We write $a = \\sum_i a_i e^i$ and $F_A = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j} F_{ij} e^i \\wedge e^j$, where $a_i = a(e_i)$ and $F_{ij} = F_A(e_i, e_j)$ are sections of $\\mathrm{ad}P$.\nThe pointwise inner product of two $2$-forms $\\alpha, \\beta$ is $\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} \\langle \\alpha_{ij}, \\beta_{ij} \\rangle$. The Lie bracket-wedge product $[a \\wedge a]$ has components $([a \\wedge a])_{ij} = 2[a_i, a_j]$.\n\\begin{align*} \\langle F_A, [a \\wedge a] \\rangle &= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\langle F_{ij}, ([a \\wedge a])_{ij} \\rangle \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\langle F_{ij}, 2[a_i, a_j] \\rangle = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\langle F_{ij}, [a_i, a_j] \\rangle. \\end{align*}\nUsing the $\\operatorname{Ad}$-invariance of the inner product on $\\mathfrak{g}$, which implies $\\langle X, [Y,Z] \\rangle = \\langle [X,Y], Z \\rangle$, we can write:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\langle F_{ij}, [a_i, a_j] \\rangle = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\langle [F_{ij}, a_i], a_j \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^n [F_{ij}, a_i], a_j \\right\\rangle.\n$$\nThis expression is the pointwise inner product $\\langle \\mathcal{F}(a), a \\rangle$, where $\\mathcal{F}(a)$ is a $1$-form whose $j$-th component is $(\\mathcal{F}(a))_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n [F_{ij}, a_i]$.\n\nCombining the two parts, the second variation is:\n$$\n\\delta^2\\mathcal{YM}(A)[a,a] = \\int_{M} \\langle a, d_A^* d_A a + \\mathcal{F}(a) \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{dvol}_{g}.\n$$\nThus, the operator $L_A$ is given by $L_A a = d_A^* d_A a + \\mathcal{F}(a)$.\n\nTo find the explicit local expression for $L_A$, we compute the components of $d_A^* d_A a$. In the local orthonormal frame (chosen to be normal at a point, so $\\nabla_{e_i}e_j=0$), the exterior covariant derivative $d_A$ and its adjoint $d_A^*$ have the component expressions:\nFor a $1$-form $\\alpha = \\sum_j \\alpha_j e^j$, $(d_A \\alpha)_{ij} = \\nabla^A_{e_i} \\alpha_j - \\nabla^A_{e_j} \\alpha_i$.\nFor a $2$-form $\\beta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j} \\beta_{ij} e^i \\wedge e^j$, $(d_A^* \\beta)_j = -\\sum_i \\nabla^A_{e_i} \\beta_{ij}$.\nHere $\\nabla^A$ is the covariant derivative on $\\mathrm{ad}P$.\n\nSo, for $\\beta = d_A a$, the $j$-th component of $d_A^* d_A a$ is:\n\\begin{align*} (d_A^* d_A a)_j &= -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla^A_{e_i} ( (d_A a)_{ij} ) \\\\ &= -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla^A_{e_i} (\\nabla^A_{e_i} a_j - \\nabla^A_{e_j} a_i) \\\\ &= -\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\nabla^A_{e_i})^2 a_j + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla^A_{e_i} \\nabla^A_{e_j} a_i. \\end{align*}\nWe use the commutation relation for covariant derivatives, $[\\nabla^A_{e_i}, \\nabla^A_{e_j}]s = [F_{ij}, s]$ for a section $s \\in \\Gamma(\\mathrm{ad}P)$, to rewrite the second term:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla^A_{e_i} \\nabla^A_{e_j} a_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\nabla^A_{e_j} \\nabla^A_{e_i} a_i + [\\nabla^A_{e_i}, \\nabla^A_{e_j}] a_i) = \\nabla^A_{e_j}\\left(\\sum_i \\nabla^A_{e_i} a_i\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^n [F_{ij}, a_i].\n$$\nThe term $\\sum_i \\nabla^A_{e_i} a_i$ is the component expression for $-d_A^* a$. By the imposed Coulomb gauge condition, $d_A^* a = 0$. Therefore, this term vanishes.\nSo, we have:\n$$\n(d_A^* d_A a)_j = -\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\nabla^A_{e_i})^2 a_j + \\sum_{i=1}^n [F_{ij}, a_i].\n$$\nThe first term, $-\\sum_i (\\nabla^A_{e_i})^2 a_j$, is the $j$-th component of the Bochner Laplacian $\\nabla_A^* \\nabla_A a$.\n\nFinally, we assemble the components of $L_A a$:\n\\begin{align*} (L_A a)_j &= (d_A^* d_A a)_j + (\\mathcal{F}(a))_j \\\\ &= \\left( -\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\nabla^A_{e_i})^2 a_j + \\sum_{i=1}^n [F_{ij}, a_i] \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n [F_{ij}, a_i] \\right) \\\\ &= -\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\nabla^A_{e_i})^2 a_j + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n [F_{ij}, a_i]. \\end{align*}\nThe operator $L_A$ acts on a $1$-form $a = \\sum_j a_j e^j$ to produce the $1$-form $L_A a = \\sum_j (L_A a)_j e^j$. The expression above gives the components of the resulting form.
