Let $L$ be a linear partial differential operator of order $k$ on a domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, given by $L u = \\sum_{|\\alpha| \\le k} c_{\\alpha}(x) \\partial^{\\alpha}u$. The principal symbol of $L$, denoted $\\sigma_k(L)(x, \\xi)$, is defined by considering only the highest-order terms of the operator ($|\\alpha|=k$) and replacing each partial derivative $\\partial_j = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}$ with the corresponding cotangent variable $\\xi_j$. This yields a function on the cotangent bundle $T^*\\Omega$ that is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k$ in the fiber variable $\\xi$. For a multi-index $\\alpha = (\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n)$, we have $\\partial^{\\alpha} \\to \\xi^{\\alpha} = \\xi_1^{\\alpha_1}\\cdots\\xi_n^{\\alpha_n}$.\nThe principal symbol is thus given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_k(L)(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{|\\alpha|=k} c_{\\alpha}(x)\\xi^{\\alpha}\n$$\nThe given operator is\n$$\nL = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} a^{ij}(x)\\,\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} b^{i}(x)\\,\\partial_{i} + c(x)\n$$\nThis is a second-order operator, so $k=2$. The highest-order terms are those with two derivatives, i.e., the sum involving $a^{ij}(x)$. The terms involving $b^i(x)$ are of order $1$, and the term $c(x)$ is of order $0$.\nFollowing the definition, we construct the principal symbol by taking the coefficients of the terms of order $2$ and replacing $\\partial_i\\partial_j$ with $\\xi_i\\xi_j$. The principal symbol $\\sigma_2(L)(x, \\xi)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_2(L)(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} a^{ij}(x)\\xi_i\\xi_j\n$$\nThis is a quadratic form in the cotangent variable $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $A(x)$ be the matrix with entries $a^{ij}(x)$. We can write this expression in matrix form as $\\xi^{\\top}A(x)\\xi$. Since partial derivatives commute for smooth functions ($\\partial_i\\partial_j = \\partial_j\\partial_i$), we can always symmetrize the matrix of coefficients by replacing $a^{ij}$ with $\\frac{1}{2}(a^{ij}+a^{ji})$ without changing the operator $L$. Hence, we can assume without loss of generality that the matrix $A(x)$ is symmetric.\n\nNext, we state the ellipticity conditions.\nA second-order operator $L$ is defined to be **elliptic at a point $x \\in \\Omega$** if its principal symbol is nonzero for all nonzero cotangent vectors $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. For a real-valued symbol, this is equivalent to the quadratic form $\\sigma_2(L)(x,\\xi)$ being definite (either positive definite or negative definite). The standard convention is to require positive definiteness. Thus, $L$ is elliptic at $x$ if\n$$\n\\sigma_2(L)(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} a^{ij}(x)\\xi_i\\xi_j > 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}\n$$\nThis is precisely the condition that the symmetric matrix of coefficients $A(x) = (a^{ij}(x))$ is positive definite at $x$.\n\nThe operator $L$ is **uniformly elliptic on $\\Omega$** if there exists a constant $\\lambda > 0$ (the ellipticity constant) such that for all $x \\in \\Omega$ and for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} a^{ij}(x)\\xi_i\\xi_j \\ge \\lambda|\\xi|^2\n$$\nwhere $|\\xi|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i^2$. This condition is equivalent to stating that the smallest eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A(x)$ is uniformly bounded below by a positive constant $\\lambda$ over the entire domain $\\Omega$.\n\nNow, we specialize to the constant-coefficient case in dimension $n=2$. The coefficient matrix is given as:\n$$\nA = \\bigl(a^{ij}\\bigr) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe entries are $a^{11}=3$, $a^{12}=1$, $a^{21}=1$, and $a^{22}=2$. Since the coefficients are constant, the principal symbol $\\sigma_2(L)(\\xi)$ is a function of $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$ only:\n$$\n\\sigma_2(L)(\\xi) = a^{11}\\xi_1^2 + (a^{12}+a^{21})\\xi_1\\xi_2 + a^{22}\\xi_2^2\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\sigma_2(L)(\\xi) = 3\\xi_1^2 + (1+1)\\xi_1\\xi_2 + 2\\xi_2^2 = 3\\xi_1^2 + 2\\xi_1\\xi_2 + 2\\xi_2^2\n$$\nThis is the required homogeneous polynomial of degree $2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the optimal ellipticity constant $\\lambda_{\\min}$, which is defined as the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.

We are to determine its kernel, cokernel, verify the Fredholm alternative, and compute its index.\n\nThe space $L^{2}(S^{1})$ is a Hilbert space endowed with the inner product\n$$\n\\langle f, g \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f(\\theta) \\overline{g(\\theta)} d\\theta\n$$\nfor $f, g \\in L^{2}(S^{1})$. Functions in $H^2(S^1)$ are $2\\pi$-periodic and have derivatives up to order $2$ in $L^2(S^1)$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Kernel of $L$**\n\nThe kernel of $L$, denoted $\\ker(L)$, consists of all functions $u \\in H^{2}(S^{1})$ such that $Lu=0$. This corresponds to solving the homogeneous ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}u}{d\\theta^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear function of $\\theta$:\n$$\nu(\\theta) = c_1 \\theta + c_2\n$$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are complex constants. For $u$ to be a well-defined function on the circle $S^1$, it must be $2\\pi$-periodic. This imposes the boundary conditions $u(0) = u(2\\pi)$ and $u'(0) = u'(2\\pi)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative $u'(\\theta) = c_1$. The condition $u'(0) = u'(2\\pi)$ becomes $c_1 = c_1$, which is always true and imposes no constraint on $c_1$.\n\nSecond, we apply the condition $u(0) = u(2\\pi)$:\n$$\nu(0) = c_1(0) + c_2 = c_2\n$$\n$$\nu(2\\pi) = c_1(2\\pi) + c_2\n$$\nSetting $u(0) = u(2\\pi)$ yields $c_2 = 2\\pi c_1 + c_2$, which simplifies to $2\\pi c_1 = 0$. This implies $c_1 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are of the form $u(\\theta) = c_2$, i.e., constant functions. The space of constant functions is a one-dimensional vector space spanned by the function $u(\\theta)=1$. Thus,\n$$\n\\ker(L) = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{C}}\\{1\\}\n$$\nThe dimension of the kernel is $\\dim\\ker(L) = 1$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Cokernel of $L$**\n\nThe cokernel of $L$ is defined as the quotient space $\\operatorname{coker}(L) = L^{2}(S^{1}) / \\operatorname{Im}(L)$, where $\\operatorname{Im}(L)$ is the range of $L$. For a Fredholm operator, its range is closed, and we have the isomorphism $\\operatorname{coker}(L) \\cong \\ker(L^*)$, where $L^*$ is the formal adjoint of $L$.\n\nThe adjoint $L^*$ is defined by the relation $\\langle Lu, v \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle u, L^*v \\rangle_{L^2}$ for all $u, v$ in the domain of $L$ (and its adjoint), which is $H^2(S^1)$. We compute the left-hand side using integration by parts. For any $u,v \\in H^2(S^1)$:\n$$\n\\langle Lu, v \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d^{2}u}{d\\theta^{2}} \\overline{v(\\theta)} d\\theta\n$$\nIntegrating by parts once:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} u''(\\theta) \\overline{v(\\theta)} d\\theta = \\left[ u'(\\theta) \\overline{v(\\theta)} \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} u'(\\theta) \\overline{v'(\\theta)} d\\theta\n$$\nSince $u$ and $v$ are $2\\pi$-periodic, $u'(2\\pi)=u'(0)$ and $v(2\\pi)=v(0)$, so the boundary term vanishes: $[ u' \\overline{v} ]_{0}^{2\\pi} = u'(2\\pi)\\overline{v(2\\pi)} - u'(0)\\overline{v(0)} = u'(0)\\overline{v(0)} - u'(0)\\overline{v(0)} = 0$.\n\nIntegrating by parts a second time:\n$$\n-\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} u'(\\theta) \\overline{v'(\\theta)} d\\theta = -\\left[ u(\\theta) \\overline{v'(\\theta)} \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} + \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} u(\\theta) \\overline{v''(\\theta)} d\\theta\n$$\nAgain, the boundary term vanishes due to periodicity. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\langle Lu, v \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} u(\\theta) \\overline{\\frac{d^2v}{d\\theta^2}(\\theta)} d\\theta = \\left\\langle u, \\frac{d^2v}{d\\theta^2} \\right\\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle u, Lv \\rangle_{L^2}\n$$\nBy comparing $\\langle Lu, v \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle u, L^*v \\rangle_{L^2}$ with $\\langle Lu, v \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle u, Lv \\rangle_{L^2}$, we identify the adjoint operator as $L^* = L = \\frac{d^2}{d\\theta^2}$. The operator $L$ is formally self-adjoint.\n\nNow, we can find the cokernel by computing the kernel of the adjoint:\n$$\n\\ker(L^*) = \\ker(L)\n$$\nFrom our previous calculation, we know that $\\ker(L)$ is the one-dimensional space of constant functions. Therefore,\n$$\n\\ker(L^*) = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{C}}\\{1\\}\n$$\nThe dimension of the cokernel is $\\dim\\operatorname{coker}(L) = \\dim\\ker(L^*) = 1$.\n\n**3. Verification of the Fredholm Alternative**\n\nThe Fredholm alternative states that the inhomogeneous equation $Lu = f$ has a solution for $u \\in H^2(S^1)$ if and only if $f$ is orthogonal to the kernel of the adjoint, $\\ker(L^*)$.\nIn our case, the condition is that $f$ must be orthogonal to every function in $\\ker(L^*)=\\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{C}}\\{1\\}$. This is equivalent to requiring that $f$ be orthogonal to the constant function $1$:\n$$\n\\langle f, 1 \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f(\\theta) \\overline{1} d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f(\\theta) d\\theta = 0\n$$\nThis condition means that the average value of $f$ over the circle must be zero.\n\nTo verify this and construct a solution, we use Fourier series. Any function $g \\in L^2(S^1)$ can be expanded as $g(\\theta) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\hat{g}_n e^{in\\theta}$ for some Fourier coefficients $\\hat{g}_n$. The operator $L$ acts on the basis functions $e^{in\\theta}$ as:\n$$\nL(e^{in\\theta}) = \\frac{d^2}{d\\theta^2} (e^{in\\theta}) = (in)^2 e^{in\\theta} = -n^2 e^{in\\theta}\n$$\nApplying $L$ to $u(\\theta) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\hat{u}_n e^{in\\theta}$ gives:\n$$\nLu = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\hat{u}_n (-n^2 e^{in\\theta}) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (-n^2 \\hat{u}_n) e^{in\\theta}\n$$\nThe equation $Lu=f$ becomes, in terms of Fourier series:\n$$\n\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (-n^2 \\hat{u}_n) e^{in\\theta} = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\hat{f}_n e^{in\\theta}\n$$\nBy uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, this equality must hold for each mode $n$:\n$$\n-n^2 \\hat{u}_n = \\hat{f}_n, \\quad \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nLet's analyze this algebraic equation:\n- If $n \\neq 0$, we can solve for $\\hat{u}_n$ uniquely: $\\hat{u}_n = -\\frac{\\hat{f}_n}{n^2}$.\n- If $n = 0$, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot \\hat{u}_0 = \\hat{f}_0$. This equation has a solution only if $\\hat{f}_0=0$.\n\nThe condition $\\hat{f}_0 = 0$ is precisely the solvability condition we derived earlier. The $0$-th Fourier coefficient (up to a factor of $2\\pi$) is the average value of the function: $\\hat{f}_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} f(\\theta) e^{-i(0)\\theta} d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} f(\\theta) d\\theta$. Thus, $\\hat{f}_0 = 0$ is equivalent to $\\int_0^{2\\pi} f(\\theta) d\\theta = 0$.\n\nThis confirms that a solution exists if and only if $f$ is orthogonal to $\\ker(L^*)$.\n\nWhen the solvability condition $\\hat{f}_0 = 0$ is met, we can construct a solution. The coefficient $\\hat{u}_0$ is undetermined, so we can choose it to be any constant, say $C$. The other coefficients are fixed. A solution $u(\\theta)$ is given by its Fourier series:\n$$\nu(\\theta) = C + \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n \\neq 0} \\left(-\\frac{\\hat{f}_n}{n^2}\\right) e^{in\\theta}\n$$\nThe arbitrary constant $C = \\hat{u}_0$ reflects that if $u_p$ is a particular solution, the general solution is $u_p + u_h$, where $u_h \\in \\ker(L)$ is any constant function. The convergence of this series in the $H^2$ norm is guaranteed as long as $f \\in L^2(S^1)$, since the coefficients $|\\hat{u}_n|$ decay faster than $|\\hat{f}_n|$. This completes the verification.\n\n**4. Computation of the Fredholm Index**\n\nThe Fredholm index of a linear operator $L$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ind}(L) = \\dim\\ker(L) - \\dim\\operatorname{coker}(L)\n$$\nUsing the dimensions we calculated:\n- $\\dim\\ker(L) = 1$\n- $\\dim\\operatorname{coker}(L) = \\dim\\ker(L^*) = 1$\n\nThe index is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ind}(L) = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for elliptic operators on compact manifolds.

Thus, the zero set is the collection of integer points on the two parabolas defined by $m=n^2$ and $m=-n^2$.\n\nSecond, we determine whether $L$ is a Fredholm operator. A differential operator on a compact manifold like $\\mathbb{T}^2$ is a Fredholm operator if and only if it is elliptic. An operator is elliptic if its principal symbol is non-zero for all non-zero covectors.\nThe order of the operator $L=\\partial_x^2+\\partial_y^4$ is $k=4$, determined by the highest-order derivative term $\\partial_y^4$. The principal symbol $\\sigma_k(L)(\\xi)$ is formed by taking the highest-order terms in the full symbol polynomial, which is obtained by replacing $\\partial_x$ with $i\\xi_1$ and $\\partial_y$ with $i\\xi_2$. The full symbol is $\\sigma(L)(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = (i\\xi_1)^2 + (i\\xi_2)^4 = -\\xi_1^2 + \\xi_2^4$. The highest order part is of order $4$.\nThe principal symbol of $L$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_4(L)(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = (i\\xi_2)^4 = \\xi_2^4.\n$$\nFor $L$ to be elliptic, $\\sigma_4(L)(\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$ must be non-zero for all $(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. However, $\\sigma_4(L)(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = \\xi_2^4 = 0$ whenever $\\xi_2=0$, regardless of the value of $\\xi_1$. For instance, for the covector $(1,0)$, which is non-zero, the principal symbol is $\\sigma_4(L)(1,0)=0$.\nSince the principal symbol has zeros for non-zero covectors, the operator $L$ is not elliptic. Because ellipticity is a necessary and sufficient condition for a differential operator on a compact manifold to be Fredholm, we conclude that $L:H^{s}(\\mathbb{T}^{2})\\to H^{s-4}(\\mathbb{T}^{2})$ is not a Fredholm operator.\nThis is consistent with the fact that the zero set of the discrete symbol, $\\{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 : m = \\pm n^2\\}$, is infinite. An operator on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ is Fredholm if and only if its symbol is non-zero for all but a finite number of frequencies. The kernel of $L$ is the span of the eigenfunctions $\\{\\exp(i(mx+ny))\\}$ where $a(m,n)=0$. Since there are infinitely many such frequencies, the kernel of $L$ is infinite-dimensional, which violates the definition of a Fredholm operator (requiring a finite-dimensional kernel).\n\nThird, we compute a closed-form expression for the counting function $N(R)$.\nThe function is defined as:\n$$\nN(R)=\\#\\Big\\{(m,n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2}:\\max(|m|,|n|)\\le R,\\ a(m,n)=0\\Big\\}.\n$$\nThe conditions are:\n1. $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$\n2. $m=n^2$ or $m=-n^2$\n3. $|m| \\leq R$ and $|n| \\leq R$\n\nFrom condition 2, we have $|m|=|n^2|=n^2$. Substituting this into condition 3 gives $n^2 \\le R$ and $|n| \\le R$.\nThe inequality $n^2 \\le R$ implies $|n| \\le \\sqrt{R}$ for $R \\ge 0$.\nIf an integer $n$ satisfies $|n| \\le \\sqrt{R}$, it automatically satisfies $|n| \\le R$ for any $R \\ge 1$. For $R \\in [0,1)$, the only integer satisfying $|n| \\le \\sqrt{R}$ is $n=0$, which also satisfies $|n| \\le R$. Thus, for any $R \\ge 0$, the constraint on $n$ simplifies to $|n| \\le \\sqrt{R}$.\n\nWe must count the number of integer pairs $(m,n)$ satisfying these conditions. We analyze the two cases for the zero set, $m=n^2$ and $m=-n^2$.\n\nCase 1: $m=n^2$.\nWe need to count the number of integers $n$ such that $|n| \\le \\sqrt{R}$. These integers are $n \\in \\{-\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor, \\dots, -1, 0, 1, \\dots, \\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor\\}$. The number of such integers is $2\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor+1$. Each such integer $n$ gives a unique pair $(m,n)=(n^2,n)$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\nCase 2: $m=-n^2$.\nSimilarly, we need to count integers $n$ such that $|n| \\le \\sqrt{R}$. Again, there are $2\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor+1$ such values of $n$. Each gives a unique pair $(m,n)=(-n^2,n)$.\n\nTo find the total number of points $N(R)$, we sum the counts from both cases and subtract the number of points in their intersection to avoid double-counting, according to the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nThe intersection consists of pairs $(m,n)$ that satisfy both $m=n^2$ and $m=-n^2$. This implies $n^2=-n^2$, so $2n^2=0$, which yields $n=0$. If $n=0$, then $m=0^2=0$. The only point in the intersection is $(0,0)$. This point satisfies the box constraint $\\max(|0|,|0|) \\le R$ for all $R \\ge 0$. Thus, the intersection contains exactly one point.\n\nThe total count is:\n$$\nN(R) = (\\text{count for } m=n^2) + (\\text{count for } m=-n^2) - (\\text{count of intersection})\n$$\n$$\nN(R) = (2\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor+1) + (2\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor+1) - 1\n$$\n$$\nN(R) = 4\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor+2 - 1\n$$\n$$\nN(R) = 4\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor+1.\n$$\nThis expression is the exact closed-form solution for the counting function $N(R)$ for $R \\in [0, \\infty)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\lfloor\\sqrt{R}\\rfloor + 1}\n$$", "id": "3035387"}]}
