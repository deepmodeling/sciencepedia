The base manifold is $S^1 = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$. The cover is given by two charts, $U_0$ and $U_1$. The intersection $U_0 \\cap U_1$ is the set $S^1 \\setminus \\{ \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4} \\}$, which has two connected components.\n\nComponent 1: Let $x \\in S^1$ be represented by a real number in $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4})$.\nThe unique representative of $x$ in $(-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4})$ is $r_0(x) = x$. The local frame is $s_0(x) = [x, 1]$.\nThe unique representative of $x$ in $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{5}{4})$ is $r_1(x) = x$. The local frame is $s_1(x) = [x, 1]$.\nThe transition function $g_{01}(x)$ is defined by $s_1(x) = g_{01}(x) s_0(x)$, which gives $[x, 1] = g_{01}(x) [x, 1]$. This implies $g_{01}(x) = 1$.\n\nComponent 2: Consider a point $x \\in S^1$ in the other component of the intersection, represented by a real number $y \\in (\\frac{3}{4}, 1)$.\nThe unique representative of $x$ in $U_0$'s interval $(-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4})$ is $r_0(x) = y-1$. Thus, the local frame is $s_0(x) = [y-1, 1]$.\nThe unique representative of $x$ in $U_1$'s interval $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{5}{4})$ is $r_1(x) = y$. Thus, the local frame is $s_1(x) = [y, 1]$.\nThe transition function is defined by $s_1(x) = g_{01}(x)s_0(x)$, which means $[y, 1] = g_{01}(x)[y-1, 1]$.\nTo compare these vectors, we use the bundle's identification rule $(z, t) \\sim (z+1, -t)$ to express the vector for $s_0(x)$ in the fiber over $y$:\n$[y-1, 1] = [(y-1)+1, -1] = [y, -1]$.\nThe relation becomes $[y, 1] = g_{01}(x)[y, -1]$. Comparing the fiber components gives the scalar equation $1 = g_{01}(x) \\cdot (-1)$, which implies $g_{01}(x) = -1$.\nA similar argument holds for points represented in $[0, \\frac{1}{4})$.\nIn summary, $g_{01}(x) = 1$ for $x \\in (\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}) \\pmod 1$ and $g_{01}(x) = -1$ for $x \\in (-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}) \\pmod 1$.\n\nSecond, we address the connection and its curvature. The connection on $L$ descends from the trivial connection on the trivial bundle $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The trivial connection means that sections with a constant fiber coordinate are parallel. The local frames $s_0$ and $s_1$ are constructed from the constant section $(x, 1)$ on the covering space. Therefore, in the descended connection $\\nabla$, these local frames are themselves parallel.\nThis means $\\nabla s_0 = 0$ on $U_0$ and $\\nabla s_1 = 0$ on $U_1$.\nThe local connection $1$-forms $A_0$ and $A_1$ are defined by $\\nabla s_0 = s_0 \\otimes A_0$ and $\\nabla s_1 = s_1 \\otimes A_1$. Thus, $A_0 = 0$ and $A_1 = 0$.\nFor these locally-defined forms to represent a single global connection, they must satisfy the gauge transformation law on the intersection $U_0 \\cap U_1$: $A_1 = g_{01}^{-1} A_0 g_{01} + g_{01}^{-1} dg_{01}$.\nSubstituting $A_0 = 0$ and $A_1 = 0$, we must have $0 = g_{01}^{-1} dg_{01}$. This is equivalent to $dg_{01} = 0$, which means $g_{01}$ must be locally constant. As we have just computed, $g_{01}$ is indeed constant on each of the two connected components of $U_0 \\cap U_1$, taking values $1$ and $-1$. Thus, $dg_{01}=0$ on each component, and the connection is well-defined.\nThe curvature $2$-form $F$ is given locally by $F_i = dA_i + A_i \\wedge A_i$. Since this is a line bundle, the forms are scalar-valued and $A_i \\wedge A_i = 0$. So $F_i = dA_i$.\nOn $U_0$, $F_0 = dA_0 = d(0) = 0$.\nOn $U_1$, $F_1 = dA_1 = d(0) = 0$.\nSince the curvature is locally zero everywhere, the curvature $2$-form on $S^1$ is globally zero. A connection with zero curvature is called a flat connection. (Alternatively, any $2$-form on a $1$-dimensional manifold like $S^1$ is necessarily zero.)\n\nThird, we compute the holonomy. The holonomy of a connection around a loop measures the transformation of the fiber after parallel transport along the loop. We consider the loop $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to S^1$ given by $\\gamma(t) = t \\pmod 1$, which generates $\\pi_1(S^1)$.\nTo compute the holonomy, we lift the problem to the covering trivial bundle $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The loop $\\gamma$ on $S^1$ lifts to the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = t$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ on $\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet's start with an arbitrary vector $v_0$ in the fiber over the base point $\\gamma(0) = 0 \\pmod 1$. Such a vector can be written as $v_0 = [0, c]$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In the covering space, this corresponds to the vector $(0, c)$ in the fiber over $x=0$.\nThe connection on $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the trivial one, so parallel transport along a path means keeping the fiber coordinate constant. The parallel transport of the vector $(0, c)$ along the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = t$ yields the path of vectors $\\tilde{v}(t) = (t, c)$.\nAt the end of the path at $t=1$, the transported vector in the covering space is $\\tilde{v}(1) = (1, c)$. This vector is in the fiber over $x=1$.\nTo find the resulting vector in the original fiber over $0 \\pmod 1$, we use the identification rule of the Möbius bundle: $(x, t) \\sim (x+1, -t)$.\nSetting $x=0$ and $t=-c$, we get $(0, -c) \\sim (0+1, -(-c)) = (1,c)$.\nSo, the vector $(1, c)$ in the fiber over $x=1$ corresponds to the vector $(0, -c)$ in the fiber over $x=0$.\nThus, the parallel transport of the initial vector $[0, c]$ along the loop $\\gamma$ results in the final vector $[0, -c]$.\nThe holonomy map $H_\\gamma: L_0 \\to L_0$ is given by $H_\\gamma([0, c]) = [0, -c]$. This is a linear map corresponding to multiplication by $-1$. The value of the holonomy is $-1$.\n\nThe non-triviality of the bundle $L$ is demonstrated by both the transition functions and the holonomy. A line bundle is trivial if and only if its first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(L) \\in H^1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is zero. The class $w_1(L)$ is represented by the cocycle defined by the sign of the determinant of the transition functions. In our case, this corresponds to the cocycle which is $0$ on the component where $g_{01}=1$ and $1$ on the component where $g_{01}=-1$. This cocycle is non-trivial in $H^1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, so the bundle is non-trivial. Equivalently, the holonomy of a flat connection on a trivial bundle must be trivial (i.e., the identity map, corresponding to the scalar $1$). Since the holonomy is $-1$, the bundle cannot be trivial.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3037043"}]}
