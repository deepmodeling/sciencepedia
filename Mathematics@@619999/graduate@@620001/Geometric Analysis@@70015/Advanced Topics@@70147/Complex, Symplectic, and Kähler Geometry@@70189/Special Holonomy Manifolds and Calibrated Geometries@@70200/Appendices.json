Your final answer must be a single symbolic expression.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in differential geometry, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\nLet $\\Sigma$ be a connected complex one-dimensional manifold, which is equivalent to a connected real two-dimensional manifold (a surface). At any point $x \\in \\Sigma$, the tangent space $T_x\\Sigma$ is a one-dimensional complex vector space and thus a two-dimensional real vector space. The holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla)$ at a point $x$ is a subgroup of the general linear group of the tangent space, $\\mathrm{GL}(T_x\\Sigma)$.\n\nThe problem states that the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of the metric $g$ preserves $g$, i.e., $\\nabla g = 0$. This fundamental property implies that parallel transport along any piecewise smooth loop based at $x$ is an isometry of the tangent space $T_x\\Sigma$. Consequently, the holonomy group is a subgroup of the orthogonal group of $T_x\\Sigma$, which is isomorphic to $O(2)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla) \\subseteq O(2)\n$$\nFurthermore, since $\\Sigma$ is a complex manifold, it is orientable. The Levi-Civita connection preserves orientation, which restricts the holonomy group to be a subgroup of the special orthogonal group, $SO(2)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla) \\subseteq SO(2)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $(\\Sigma, g, J, \\omega)$ is a Kähler manifold. This means the metric $g$ is a Hermitian metric with respect to the complex structure $J$, and a fundamental theorem of Kähler geometry states that the Levi-Civita connection of a Kähler metric preserves the complex structure, i.e., $\\nabla J = 0$.\n\nThis condition, $\\nabla J = 0$, implies that parallel transport operators must commute with the complex structure $J$. Therefore, for any element $A \\in \\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla)$, the relation $A J_x = J_x A$ must hold.\n\nAn alternative and more direct perspective is to view $T_x\\Sigma$ as a one-dimensional complex vector space. The metric $g$ is a Hermitian inner product on this space. The group of complex linear transformations of a one-dimensional complex vector space that preserve a Hermitian inner product is, by definition, the unitary group $U(1)$. The conditions $\\nabla g=0$ and $\\nabla J=0$ together are precisely the statement that the holonomy is contained in this group:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{x}(\\nabla) \\subseteq U(1)\n$$\nThe group $U(1)$ is the group of complex numbers with modulus $1$, denoted $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |z| = 1 \\}$. This group is isomorphic to $SO(2)$, so the constraints are consistent. The task now is to identify which subgroup of $U(1)$ is the holonomy group.\n\nThe Ambrose-Singer theorem establishes a crucial link between curvature and holonomy. It states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group, $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$, is generated by curvature endomorphisms $P_{\\gamma}^{-1} R_y(u,v) P_{\\gamma}$ for all points $y \\in \\Sigma$ and all vectors $u, v \\in T_y\\Sigma$, where $P_{\\gamma}$ denotes parallel transport along a path $\\gamma$ from $x$ to $y$.\n\nFor a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $1$ (a Riemann surface), the entire Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is determined by the Gaussian curvature $K$. The curvature operator $R(u,v): T_x\\Sigma \\to T_x\\Sigma$ can be expressed as $R(u,v)w = K \\omega(u,v) Jw$. The Lie algebra of $U(1)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$, is a one-dimensional real Lie algebra. On $\\mathbb{R}^2$, its representation $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is spanned by the matrix representation of $J_x$. The curvature operators $R(u,v)$ are thus elements of this Lie algebra, specifically scalar multiples of $J_x$.\n\nThe problem states that the Gaussian curvature $K$ is not identically zero on the connected manifold $\\Sigma$. This implies that there exists at least one point $y \\in \\Sigma$ where $K(y) \\neq 0$. At such a point, the curvature tensor is non-zero. By the Ambrose-Singer theorem, the holonomy Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$ must therefore be non-trivial (i.e., not the zero algebra $\\{0\\}$).\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$ is a subalgebra of the one-dimensional Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$. The only subalgebras of a one-dimensional Lie algebra are the trivial algebra $\\{0\\}$ and the algebra itself. Since we have established that $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$ is non-trivial, it must be that:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla) = \\mathfrak{u}(1)\n$$\nThe holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x(\\nabla)$ is a Lie subgroup of $U(1)$. For a connected manifold, its identity component, the restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla)$, is a connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla)$. Since $\\mathfrak{hol}_x^0(\\nabla) = \\mathfrak{hol}_x(\\nabla) = \\mathfrak{u}(1)$, and $U(1)$ is itself a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$, we must conclude that the identity component of the holonomy group is the entire group $U(1)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla) = U(1)\n$$\nThe full holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x(\\nabla)$ contains the restricted holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla)$. Therefore, we have the following inclusions:\n$$\nU(1) = \\mathrm{Hol}_x^0(\\nabla) \\subseteq \\mathrm{Hol}_x(\\nabla) \\subseteq U(1)\n$$\nThis sequence of inclusions forces the holonomy group to be equal to $U(1)$.\nIn summary, the holonomy group of a connected one-dimensional Kähler manifold is trivial if and only if the manifold is flat ($K \\equiv 0$). If the manifold is not flat ($K \\not\\equiv 0$), as specified in the problem, the holonomy group is the full unitary group $U(1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mathrm{U}(1)}$$", "id": "3033725"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus to the second major theme of this topic: calibrated geometries, which provide a powerful tool for identifying area-minimizing submanifolds.

A Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with an almost complex structure $J$ is defined as nearly Kähler if $(\\nabla_Y J)Y = 0$ for every tangent vector field $Y$, where $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $g$.

The connection $\\nabla$ on $S^6$ is related to $D$ by the Gauss formula. For vector fields $Y, Z$ tangent to $S^6$, we have $D_Y Z = \\nabla_Y Z + h(Y,Z)$, where $h$ is the second fundamental form. The unit normal vector field on $S^6$ is the position vector field $x$. The second fundamental form is given by $h(Y,Z) = -g(Y,Z)x$. This follows from $g(D_Y Z, x) = Y(g(Z,x)) - g(Z, D_Y x) = 0 - g(Z,Y) = -g(Y,Z)$, since $Y,Z$ are tangent to the sphere, making $g(Z,x)=0$, and $D_Y x = Y$ for the position vector field. Thus, $\\nabla_Y Z$ is the tangential component of $D_Y Z$: $\\nabla_Y Z = (D_Y Z)^T$.\n\nThe covariant derivative of $J$ is given by $(\\nabla_Y J)Z = \\nabla_Y(JZ) - J(\\nabla_Y Z)$.

For the flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^7$, this implies that $\\psi$ is a constant-coefficient form, so $d\\psi = 0$.\nThus, Cartan's formula simplifies to $4\\psi = d(\\iota_X \\psi)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $d\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Omega$:\n$$\nd\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Omega = -i^*(4\\psi) = -4\\,i^*(\\psi) = -4\\,\\psi|_{TS^6}\n$$\nFinally, we use the given identity $\\psi|_{TS^6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\omega \\wedge \\omega$:\n$$\nd\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Omega = -4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\omega \\wedge \\omega\\right) = -2\\,\\omega \\wedge \\omega\n$$\nComparing this result with the given torsion relation $d\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Omega = -2\\tau\\,\\omega \\wedge \\omega$, we once again find that $\\tau=1$.\nBoth methods consistently yield the same value for the torsion constant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3033753"}]}
