This means there exists a fixed point $p \\in N$ such that $f(x) = p$ for all $x \\in M$. We will analyze each of the quantities mentioned in the problem statement under this condition.\n\nFirst, we consider the differential of $f$, denoted $df$. The differential $df$ is a section of the tensor bundle $T^*M \\otimes f^{-1}TN$. At any point $x \\in M$, $(df)_x$ is a linear map from the tangent space $T_xM$ to the tangent space $T_{f(x)}N = T_p N$. For any tangent vector $X \\in T_xM$, the vector $(df)_x(X) \\in T_pN$ is defined as the derivative of the curve $t \\mapsto f(c(t))$ at $t=0$, where $c$ is any smooth curve in $M$ with $c(0)=x$ and $c'(0)=X$. Since $f(c(t)) = p$ for all $t$, the curve $f \\circ c$ is constant. Its derivative is therefore the zero vector in $T_pN$. Thus, we have:\n$$ (df)_x(X) = 0 $$\nfor all $X \\in T_xM$ and for all $x \\in M$. This implies that the differential $df$ is the zero section of the bundle $T^*M \\otimes f^{-1}TN$, which we write as $df \\equiv 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the energy density of $f$, defined as $e(f) = \\frac{1}{2}|df|^2$. The squared norm $|df|^2$ at a point $x \\in M$ is given by $\\operatorname{tr}_g(df^* \\circ df)$, where $df^*$ is the adjoint of $df$. In local coordinates, $|df|^2 = g^{ij}h_{\\alpha\\beta} (df)_i^\\alpha (df)_j^\\beta$. Since $df \\equiv 0$, its components $(df)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial f^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i}$ are all zero. Consequently, its norm is zero at every point:\n$$ |df|^2(x) = 0 \\quad \\forall x \\in M $$\nTherefore, the energy density $e(f)$ is the constant function $0$ on $M$:\n$$ e(f) = \\frac{1}{2} (0) = 0 $$\n\nThe Bochner identity in question has the Laplace-Beltrami operator applied to the energy density, $\\Delta e(f)$, as its left-hand side. The Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ acts on a smooth function $\\phi$ by $\\Delta \\phi = \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{grad} \\phi)$. Since $e(f)$ is the constant function $0$ on $M$, its gradient is the zero vector field, $\\operatorname{grad}(e(f)) = 0$. The divergence of the zero vector field is zero. Hence, the left-hand side of the Bochner identity vanishes identically:\n$$ \\Delta e(f) = \\Delta(0) = 0 $$\n\nNow, we examine the terms on the right-hand side of the identity. The problem states that this side is a linear combination of complete contractions of the tensors $df$, $\\nabla df$, $\\tau(f)$, $R^N$ pulled back via $df$, and $\\operatorname{Ric}^M$ acted upon by $df$. We will show that each of these fundamental building blocks is zero.\n\nWe have already established that $df \\equiv 0$.\n\nLet's consider the covariant derivative of $df$, denoted $\\nabla df$. This is the covariant derivative of the zero tensor field. The covariant derivative of a constant tensor field (in this case, the zero tensor) is zero. To be explicit, the formula for the components of $\\nabla df$ is:\n$$ (\\nabla_k df)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial (df)_i^\\alpha}{\\partial x^k} - \\Gamma_{ki}^j (df)_j^\\alpha + {^N\\Gamma}_{\\beta\\gamma}^\\alpha(f) \\frac{\\partial f^\\beta}{\\partial x^k} (df)_i^\\gamma $$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ and $^N\\Gamma$ are the Christoffel symbols for $(M,g)$ and $(N,h)$ respectively. Since $f$ is constant, $\\frac{\\partial f^\\beta}{\\partial x^k}=0$, which means $(df)_k^\\beta=0$. As $df$ is the zero tensor field, all its components $(df)_i^\\alpha$ are zero, and so are their partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial (df)_i^\\alpha}{\\partial x^k}$. All three terms on the right-hand side of the equation for $(\\nabla_k df)_i^\\alpha$ are zero. Thus, $\\nabla df \\equiv 0$.\n\nNext, we consider the tension field $\\tau(f)$, which is defined as the trace of $\\nabla df$:\n$$ \\tau(f) = \\operatorname{tr}_g(\\nabla df) $$\nIn local coordinates, $\\tau(f)^\\alpha = g^{ij}(\\nabla_i df)_j^\\alpha$. Since we have shown that $\\nabla df \\equiv 0$, all of its components are zero. It follows that its trace must also be zero. Thus, $\\tau(f) \\equiv 0$.\n\nAny summand on the right-hand side of the Bochner identity is a complete contraction of a tensor product involving one or more of the following tensors:\n1.  $df$: Any term that is a multilinear function of $df$ (e.g., a contraction of a tensor product containing $df$ as a factor) must be zero, as we are contracting with a zero tensor.\n2.  $\\nabla df$: Similarly, any term involving $\\nabla df$ as a factor must be zero. A common term in Bochner identities is $|\\nabla df|^2$, which is clearly $0$ since $\\nabla df \\equiv 0$.\n3.  $\\tau(f)$: Any term involving the tension field $\\tau(f)$ as a factor must be zero.\n4.  $R^N$ pulled back via $df$: Terms involving the curvature of the target manifold $N$ are typically of the form $\\langle R^N(df(X), df(Y))df(Z), df(W)\\rangle$. Since $df$ maps every vector to the zero vector, these terms take the form $\\langle R^N(0,0)0,0\\rangle$. By the multilinearity of the Riemann tensor $R^N$, this expression is zero.\n5.  $\\operatorname{Ric}^M$ acted upon by $df$: Terms involving the Ricci curvature of the domain manifold $M$ are typically of the form $\\operatorname{tr}_g(X \\mapsto \\langle df(\\operatorname{Ric}^M(X)), df(Y)\\rangle)$ for some $Y$ also constructed from basis vectors. Since $df \\equiv 0$, the expression inside the trace is always zero. For example, a standard term is $-\\operatorname{tr}_g(df \\circ \\operatorname{Ric}^M \\circ df^*)$, which is zero if $df=0$.\n\nSince every one of the fundamental tensors $df$, $\\nabla df$, and $\\tau(f)$ is identically zero for a constant map $f$, any term constructed as a contraction of a tensor product involving any of these tensors must also be zero. The problem statement guarantees that all terms on the right-hand side are of this nature. Therefore, every summand on the right-hand side of the identity is pointwise zero on $M$. The sum of these terms is consequently zero.\n\nIn conclusion, for a constant map $f$, both the left-hand side, $\\Delta e(f)$, and the right-hand side of any standard Bochner identity for harmonic maps are identically zero as functions on $M$. The common value of the two sides at any point of $M$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3025936"}, {"introduction": "The Bochner formula is not magic; it is a direct consequence of the fundamental definitions of curvature and covariant differentiation.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Formula\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta |df|^{2}$. This is the Laplacian of the energy density, $\\Delta e(f)$.\nThe energy density is $e(f) = \\frac{1}{2}|df|^2$. In local coordinates, the squared norm of the differential $df$ is given by\n$$|df|^2 = g^{ij} \\langle df(\\partial_i), df(\\partial_j) \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^k}$$\nThe target space is $\\mathbb{R}^k$ with the standard Euclidean metric. The components of $f$ are $f^\\alpha$, so $df(\\partial_i)$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ with components $(\\nabla_i f^1, \\dots, \\nabla_i f^k)$. Since $f^\\alpha$ are scalar functions, $\\nabla_i f^\\alpha = \\partial_i f^\\alpha$. Using the problem's notation, $f^\\alpha_i = \\nabla_i f^\\alpha$.\nThe inner product in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ is $\\langle v, w \\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k v^\\alpha w^\\alpha$. Thus,\n$$|df|^2 = g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k (\\nabla_i f^\\alpha)(\\nabla_j f^\\alpha) = g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_j$$\nThe energy density is $e(f) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_j$. We want to compute $\\Delta e(f) = g^{ab} \\nabla_a \\nabla_b e(f)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the first covariant derivative of $e(f)$. Since $e(f)$ is a scalar function, $\\nabla_b e(f) = \\partial_b e(f)$.\n$$\\nabla_b e(f) = \\nabla_b \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_j \\right)$$\nUsing the product rule and metric compatibility ($\\nabla_b g^{ij} = 0$):\n$$\\nabla_b e(f) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} \\nabla_b(f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_j) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} ((\\nabla_b f^\\alpha_i) f^\\alpha_j + f^\\alpha_i (\\nabla_b f^\\alpha_j))$$\nUsing the specified notation $\\nabla_b f^\\alpha_i = f^\\alpha_{i;b}$, and relabeling dummy indices in the second term ($i \\leftrightarrow j$):\n$$\\nabla_b e(f) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} (f^\\alpha_{i;b} f^\\alpha_j + f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b}) = g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b}$$\nNext, we compute the second covariant derivative $\\nabla_a(\\nabla_b e(f))$:\n$$\\nabla_a \\nabla_b e(f) = \\nabla_a \\left( g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b} \\right) = g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} \\nabla_a(f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b})$$\n$$\\nabla_a \\nabla_b e(f) = g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} ((\\nabla_a f^\\alpha_j) f^\\alpha_{i;b} + f^\\alpha_j (\\nabla_a f^\\alpha_{i;b})) = g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} (f^\\alpha_{j;a} f^\\alpha_{i;b} + f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b;a})$$\nNow, we take the trace to find the Laplacian:\n$$\\Delta e(f) = g^{ab} \\nabla_a \\nabla_b e(f) = g^{ab} g^{ij} \\sum_{\\alpha} (f^\\alpha_{j;a} f^\\alpha_{i;b} + f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b;a})$$\nThis expression is tensorial and valid at any point. Let's analyze its two parts.\nThe first part is $T_1 = \\sum_{\\alpha} g^{ab} g^{ij} f^\\alpha_{j;a} f^\\alpha_{i;b}$. The Hessian of a scalar function is symmetric, i.e., $f^\\alpha_{j;a} = f^\\alpha_{a;j}$. Relabeling indices, this becomes $\\sum_\\alpha g^{aj}g^{bi} f^\\alpha_{a;j} f^\\alpha_{b;i}$, which is the squared norm of the Hessians, $\\sum_\\alpha |\\nabla^2 f^\\alpha|^2$.\n\nThe second part is $T_2 = \\sum_{\\alpha} g^{ab} g^{ij} f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b;a}$. We use the harmonic map condition to simplify this term.\nThe tension field $\\tau(f)$ for a map into a flat space like $\\mathbb{R}^k$ has components $\\tau(f)^\\alpha = \\Delta f^\\alpha = g^{ba} \\nabla_b \\nabla_a f^\\alpha = g^{ba} f^\\alpha_{;a;b}$.\nThe condition $\\tau(f)=0$ implies $\\Delta f^\\alpha = 0$ for all $\\alpha=1,\\dots,k$.\nThe covariant derivative of a vanishing tensor is zero, so $\\nabla_i(\\Delta f^\\alpha) = 0$.\n$$\\nabla_i(\\Delta f^\\alpha) = \\nabla_i(g^{ba} f^\\alpha_{;a;b}) = g^{ba} \\nabla_i \\nabla_b \\nabla_a f^\\alpha = g^{ba} f^\\alpha_{;a;b;i} = 0$$\nWe use the Ricci identity to commute covariant derivatives. For a 1-form $\\omega_k$ (like $df^\\alpha$ with components $f^\\alpha_k$), the identity is $\\nabla_a\\nabla_b \\omega_k - \\nabla_b\\nabla_a \\omega_k = -R^p_{kba} \\omega_p$. In our notation, $f^\\alpha_{k;b;a} - f^\\alpha_{k;a;b} = -R^p_{kba} f^\\alpha_p$.\nNow consider $g^{ba}f^\\alpha_{i;b;a} = g^{ba}\\nabla_a \\nabla_b f^\\alpha_i$. We can commute $\\nabla_a$ and $\\nabla_b$ on the scalar function $f^\\alpha$ to get $\\nabla_b\\nabla_a f^\\alpha$, but not on the 1-form $f^\\alpha_i$.\nLet's commute $\\nabla_i$ with $\\nabla_b \\nabla_a$:\n$$g^{ba} f^\\alpha_{;a;b;i} = g^{ba} \\nabla_i (f^\\alpha_{;a;b}) = g^{ba} (\\nabla_a f^\\alpha_{;i;b} - R^p_{iab} f^\\alpha_{;p})$$\n$$g^{ba} \\nabla_i (f^\\alpha_{;a;b}) = g^{ba} (\\nabla_a (\\nabla_b f^\\alpha_i) - R^p_{iab} f^\\alpha_p) = g^{ba} \\nabla_a(f^\\alpha_{i;b}) - g^{ba}R^p_{iab}f^\\alpha_p$$\nThe first term is $g^{ba} \\nabla_a(f^\\alpha_{;i;b})$. Because the Hessian is symmetric ($f^\\alpha_{;i;b}=f^\\alpha_{;b;i}$), this is $g^{ba} \\nabla_a(f^\\alpha_{;b;i})$.\nThe second term involves the Ricci tensor: $g^{ba}R^p_{iab} = R^p_i = g^{pq} \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{qi}$.\nSo, $g^{ba}f^\\alpha_{;a;b;i} = g^{ba}\\nabla_a\\nabla_i f^\\alpha_{;b} - R^{p}_i f^\\alpha_p = 0$.\nThe problem is that my term is $f_{i;b;a}^\\alpha$, not $f_{a;b;i}^\\alpha$. A different commutation is needed.\nLet's use the identity $g^{ba}\\nabla_a\\nabla_b \\omega_i = \\nabla_i(\\Delta_H \\omega) - \\nabla^k\\nabla_k \\omega_i...$ No, this is too complex.\n\nA more direct commutation works:\n$g^{ab}f^\\alpha_{i;b;a} = g^{ab}\\nabla_a\\nabla_b f^\\alpha_i$.\nUsing the Ricci identity on the 1-form $f^\\alpha_i$:\n$g^{ab}f^\\alpha_{i;b;a} = g^{ab}(\\nabla_b\\nabla_a f^\\alpha_i - R^p_{iab}f^\\alpha_p) = g^{ab}\\nabla_b\\nabla_a f^\\alpha_i - g^{ab}R^p_{iab}f^\\alpha_p$.\nThe first term is $\\nabla_b(g^{ab}\\nabla_a f^\\alpha_i) = \\text{div}(\\nabla f^\\alpha_i)$. This isn't $\\nabla_i(\\Delta f^\\alpha)$.\nThe correct approach is to commute $\\nabla_a$ past $\\nabla_i$ in $f^\\alpha_{;a;b;i} = \\nabla_i(f^\\alpha_{;a;b})$.\n$g^{ba}\\nabla_i\\nabla_b\\nabla_a f^\\alpha = g^{ba}(\\nabla_b\\nabla_i\\nabla_a f^\\alpha - R^p_{aib}f^\\alpha_p) = g^{ba}\\nabla_b(\\nabla_i\\nabla_a f^\\alpha) - g^{ba}R^p_{aib}f^\\alpha_p$.\nUsing symmetry of the Hessian $f^\\alpha_{;i;a}=f^\\alpha_{;a;i}$: $g^{ba}\\nabla_b(\\nabla_a\\nabla_i f^\\alpha) - R^p_i f^\\alpha_p = \\nabla_b(g^{ba}\\nabla_a\\nabla_i f^\\alpha) - R^p_i f^\\alpha_p$.\nSo $g^{ba}f^\\alpha_{;a;b;i} = \\nabla_b(g^{ba} f^\\alpha_{;a;i}) - R^p_i f^\\alpha_p = 0$.\nThis identity holds because $\\nabla_i(\\Delta f^\\alpha)=0$.\nThe term we have is $T_2 = \\sum_\\alpha g^{ij} g^{ab} f^\\alpha_j f^\\alpha_{i;b;a}$.\nSwapping indices $i \\leftrightarrow j$ and $a \\leftrightarrow b$: $T_2 = \\sum_\\alpha g^{ji} g^{ba} f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_{j;a;b}$.\nUsing the aformentioned identity $g^{ba}f^\\alpha_{;j;a;b} = R^p_j f^\\alpha_p$:\n$$T_2 = \\sum_\\alpha g^{ji} f^\\alpha_i (R^p_j f^\\alpha_p) = \\sum_\\alpha g^{ji} R^p_j f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_p$$\n$R^p_j = g^{pk} \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{kj}$.\n$$T_2 = \\sum_\\alpha g^{ji} g^{pk} \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{kj} f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_p$$\nNow we combine the terms:\n$$\\Delta e(f) = \\sum_\\alpha \\left( g^{ab} g^{ij} f^\\alpha_{j;a} f^\\alpha_{i;b} + g^{ji} g^{pk} \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{kj} f^\\alpha_i f^\\alpha_p \\right)$$\nThis is a fully covariant expression. To get the coordinate expression at $p$, we use the properties of normal coordinates ($g_{ij}(p)=\\delta_{ij}$, $g^{ij}(p)=\\delta^{ij}$).\nAt point $p$:\n$$T_1(p) = \\sum_\\alpha \\delta^{ab} \\delta^{ij} f^\\alpha_{j;a}(p) f^\\alpha_{i;b}(p) = \\sum_\\alpha \\sum_{i,j=1}^n (f^\\alpha_{j;i}(p))^2$$\n$$T_2(p) = \\sum_\\alpha \\delta^{ji} \\delta^{pk} \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{kj}(p) f^\\alpha_i(p) f^\\alpha_p(p) = \\sum_\\alpha \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{ij}(p) f^\\alpha_i(p) f^\\alpha_j(p)$$\nSo, the full expression for $\\Delta |df|^2(p) = 2 \\Delta e(f)(p)$ is:\n$$\\Delta |df|^2(p) = 2 \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k \\left( \\sum_{i,j=1}^n (f^{\\alpha}_{i;j}(p))^2 + \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{ij}(p) f^{\\alpha}_i(p) f^{\\alpha}_j(p) \\right)$$\nThe problem asks for $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta |df|^2(p)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta |df|^2(p) = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k \\left( \\sum_{i,j=1}^n (f^{\\alpha}_{i;j}(p))^2 + \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{ij}(p) f^{\\alpha}_i(p) f^{\\alpha}_j(p) \\right)$$\nUsing a more compact notation with implicit summation over repeated indices $i,j=1,\\dots,n$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta |df|^2(p) = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k \\left( (f^{\\alpha}_{i;j})^2 + \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{ij} f^{\\alpha}_i f^{\\alpha}_j \\right)$$\nHere, $(f^{\\alpha}_{i;j})^2$ means $f^{\\alpha}_{i;j}f^{\\alpha}_{i;j}$ summed over $i,j$.\n### Step 3: Coordinate Independence\n\nThe problem asks why this expression is independent of the chosen normal coordinates at $p$.\nThe final derived identity in its covariant form is:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta |df|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k \\left( |\\nabla^2 f^\\alpha|^2 + \\operatorname{Ric}^M(df^\\alpha, df^\\alpha) \\right)$$\nwhere $|\\nabla^2 f^\\alpha|^2 = g^{ik}g^{jl} f^\\alpha_{i;j} f^\\alpha_{k;l}$ is the squared norm of the Hessian tensor of $f^\\alpha$, and $\\operatorname{Ric}^M(df^\\alpha, df^\\alpha) = \\operatorname{Ric}^M_{ij} g^{ia} g^{jb} f^\\alpha_a f^\\alpha_b$ is the contraction of the Ricci tensor with the tensor product of the gradient of $f^\\alpha$ with itself.\nEach term in this sum is a scalar invariant, constructed by contracting tensors.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n###\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula for the differential of a harmonic map and its subsequent analysis under specific curvature conditions.\n\nLet $f: (M,g) \\to (N,h)$ be a smooth map between Riemannian manifolds. We choose a point $p \\in M$ and a local orthonormal frame field $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^m$ of $TM$ in a neighborhood of $p$ such that at $p$, we have $(\\nabla_{e_i} e_j)|_p = 0$. All calculations will be performed at this point $p$.\n\nThe fundamental step required is to express the term $\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle$ by applying the Ricci identity to commute covariant derivatives. The rough Laplacian $\\nabla^*\\nabla$ acting on the section $df \\in \\Gamma(T^*M \\otimes f^*TN)$ is related to the connection Laplacian and curvature. The procedure involves the harmonic map condition, $\\tau(f) = \\operatorname{tr}_g(\\nabla df) = \\sum_i (\\nabla_{e_i}df)(e_i) = 0$. Since this holds over all of $M$, the covariant derivative of the tension field also vanishes. For any vector field $X$ on $M$, we have $(\\nabla_X \\tau(f))|_p = \\sum_i (\\nabla_X \\nabla_{e_i} df)(e_i)|_p = 0$.\n\nThe Ricci identity for the tensor $df$ states that for any vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $M$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_X \\nabla_Y df)(Z) - (\\nabla_Y \\nabla_X df)(Z) = R^N(df(X), df(Y))df(Z) - df(R^M(X,Y)Z)\n$$\nwhere $R^M$ and $R^N$ are the Riemann curvature tensors of $M$ and $N$, respectively.\n\nThe established result of this commutation procedure, known as the Weitzenböck formula for harmonic maps, gives the following expression for $\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle df(\\operatorname{Ric}^M(e_i)), df(e_i) \\rangle_h - \\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle R^N(df(e_i), df(e_j))df(e_j), df(e_i) \\rangle_h\n$$\nHere, $\\operatorname{Ric}^M$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of $M$. The first term on the right-hand side is the contribution from the domain's curvature, and the second term is the contribution from the target's curvature.\n\nThe problem asks to isolate the domain curvature contribution under the assumption that $(M,g)$ is an Einstein manifold. The Einstein condition is $\\operatorname{Ric}^M = \\lambda g$ for some constant $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In terms of the local orthonormal frame $\\{e_i\\}$, this means $\\operatorname{Ric}^M(X) = \\lambda X$ for any tangent vector $X$. Specifically, for each basis vector $e_i$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}^M(e_i) = \\lambda e_i$.\n\nLet's compute the domain curvature contribution, which we denote by $C_M$:\n$$\nC_M = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle df(\\operatorname{Ric}^M(e_i)), df(e_i) \\rangle_h\n$$\nSubstituting the Einstein condition:\n$$\nC_M = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle df(\\lambda e_i), df(e_i) \\rangle_h\n$$\nBy linearity of the differential $df$:\n$$\nC_M = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle \\lambda df(e_i), df(e_i) \\rangle_h = \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle df(e_i), df(e_i) \\rangle_h\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle df(e_i), df(e_i) \\rangle_h$ is precisely the squared norm of the differential $df$ at the point $p$, which is $|df|^2$. Thus, the domain curvature contribution is:\n$$\nC_M = \\lambda |df|^2\n$$\nThis completes the second task.\n\nFor the final part, we must discuss the sign of $\\Delta|df|^2$. We are given the identity $\\Delta|df|^2 = 2\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle + 2|\\nabla df|^2$.\nWe have the full expression for $\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle = \\lambda|df|^2 - \\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle R^N(df(e_i), df(e_j))df(e_j), df(e_i) \\rangle_h\n$$\nWe are given that $\\lambda \\geq 0$. Since $|df|^2 \\geq 0$, the domain contribution term is non-negative:\n$$\n\\lambda|df|^2 \\geq 0\n$$\nNext, we analyze the target curvature contribution. Let $u_i = df(e_i)$. The term is $-\\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle R^N(u_i, u_j)u_j, u_i \\rangle_h$. The sectional curvature $K^N$ of $N$ for a plane spanned by orthonormal vectors $U,V$ is given by $K^N(U,V) = \\langle R^N(U,V)V, U \\rangle_h$. The hypothesis is that $(N,h)$ has non-positive sectional curvature, i.e., $K^N \\leq 0$.\nA standard result in linear algebra and geometry states that if a curvature-like tensor has non-positive sectional curvatures, then the quadratic form $\\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle R^N(u_i, u_j)u_j, u_i \\rangle_h$ is non-positive for any set of vectors $\\{u_i\\}$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle R^N(df(e_i), df(e_j))df(e_j), df(e_i) \\rangle_h \\leq 0\n$$\nThis implies that the target curvature term is non-negative:\n$$\n- \\sum_{i,j=1}^m \\langle R^N(df(e_i), df(e_j))df(e_j), df(e_i) \\rangle_h \\geq 0\n$$\nCombining the two results, we find that under the given hypotheses ($\\lambda \\geq 0$ and $K^N \\leq 0$):\n$$\n\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle \\geq 0\n$$\nNow we use the identity provided in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\Delta|df|^2 = 2\\langle\\nabla^{\\ast}\\nabla df,df\\rangle + 2|\\nabla df|^2\n$$\nThe term $|\\nabla df|^2$ is the squared norm of the tensor $\\nabla df$ and is intrinsically non-negative, $|\\nabla df|^2 \\geq 0$.\nSince both terms on the right-hand side are non-negative, we can conclude that the Laplacian of the squared norm of $df$ is non-negative:\n$$\n\\Delta|df|^2 \\geq 0\n$$\nThis means that the function $|df|^2$ is a subharmonic function on $M$. This has strong consequences, for example, if $M$ is compact, the maximum principle implies that $|df|^2$ must be a constant.\n\nThe specific question asks for the domain curvature contribution in the Einstein case. This was found to be $\\lambda |df|^2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\lambda |df|^2} $$", "id": "3025943"}]}
