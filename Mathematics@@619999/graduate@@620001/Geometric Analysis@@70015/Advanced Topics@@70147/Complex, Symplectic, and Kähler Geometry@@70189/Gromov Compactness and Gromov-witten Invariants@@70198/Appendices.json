Stability ensures that the automorphism group of the curve is finite.\n\nTo compute the complex dimension of $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{0,k}$, we first consider the open subspace $\\mathcal{M}_{0,k}$, the moduli of smooth marked curves, i.e., $C \\cong \\mathbb{P}^{1}$ with $k$ ordered, distinct marked points. The space of ordered $k$-tuples of distinct points in $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ has complex dimension $k$, since each point contributes $1$ complex parameter, subject to the distinctness condition (which does not change dimension). However, two configurations related by the action of the automorphism group of $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ should be identified.

A codimension-$1$ stratum corresponds to a stable curve with exactly one node. Such a curve consists of two irreducible components, each isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$, meeting at a single node. The $k$ marked points are distributed between the two components, and the node counts as a special point on each component. Stability requires that each component has at least $3$ special points in total. With one node present, this implies that each component must carry at least $2$ marked points.
