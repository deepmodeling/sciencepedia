The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution (up to normalization). Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Derivation of the Kähler-Einstein Metric Potential\n\nLet the Kähler potential be $\\varphi(s)$, where $s = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} z^{k}\\bar{z}^{k}$. The components of the Hermitian metric $g_{i\\bar{j}}$ are given by $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\varphi}{\\partial z^{i}\\,\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}$. Using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial\\bar{z}^{j}} = \\frac{d\\varphi}{ds} \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial\\bar{z}^{j}} = \\varphi'(s) z^{j} $$\n$$ g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{i}} \\left( \\varphi'(s) z^{j} \\right) = \\varphi'(s)\\delta_{ij} + z^{j} \\frac{\\partial(\\varphi'(s))}{\\partial z^{i}} = \\varphi'(s)\\delta_{ij} + z^{j} \\varphi''(s) \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial z^{i}} $$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial z^{i}} = \\bar{z}^{i}$, we obtain the metric tensor:\n$$ g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\varphi'(s)\\delta_{ij} + \\varphi''(s)\\bar{z}^{i}z^{j} $$\nThis matrix is of the form $A + uv^{\\dagger}$, where $A = \\varphi'(s)I_{n}$, $u = \\varphi''(s)\\bar{z}$, and $v = z$.

The standard normalization for the Fubini-Study metric corresponds to choosing $C_{0}=1$. With this choice, we find $\\lambda = n+1$. The Kähler potential for the unique (up to scaling and isometries) Kähler-Einstein metric on $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is:\n$$ \\varphi(s) = \\ln(1+s) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |z^{i}|^{2}\\right) $$\n\n### Verification and Scalar Curvature for $n=1$ ($\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$)\n\nFor $n=1$, the space is $\\mathbb{CP}^{1} \\cong S^{2}$.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of differential geometry and geometric analysis, specifically concerning Kähler geometry. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The concepts of complex projective space, the Fubini-Study metric, holomorphic vector fields, the Futaki invariant, and Kähler-Einstein metrics are all standard and rigorously defined. The problem asks for a direct application of these definitions to a fundamental example, which is a standard and meaningful calculation in the field.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Futaki invariant for a holomorphic vector field $X$ on complex projective space $(\\mathbb{CP}^{n}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}})$. The Futaki invariant, as defined in the problem, is given by the integral:\n$$ \\mathrm{Fut}(X) = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} X(h) \\, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n} $$\nwhere $h$ is a unique real-valued function on $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ determined by two conditions:\n1.

The normalization condition $\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} h \\, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n} = 0$.\n\nThe problem states that the Fubini-Study metric $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ on $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is a Kähler-Einstein (KE) metric. A direct and fundamental consequence of a metric being Kähler-Einstein, which is explicitly mentioned as a usable fact in the problem statement, is that its scalar curvature $s$ is a constant function over the entire manifold. Let us denote this constant value by $C$, so $s(p) = C$ for all points $p \\in \\mathbb{CP}^{n}$.\n\nNext, we compute the average scalar curvature $\\bar{s}$. By definition, the average of a function $f$ over a manifold $M$ with volume form $\\mathrm{dVol}$ is given by $\\frac{\\int_M f \\, \\mathrm{dVol}}{\\int_M \\mathrm{dVol}}$. In our case, the manifold is $M = \\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ and the volume form is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n}$. Thus, the average scalar curvature is:\n$$ \\bar{s} = \\frac{\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} s \\, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n}}{\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n}} $$\nSince $s$ is the constant $C$, we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$ \\bar{s} = \\frac{C \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n}}{\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n}} $$\nThe volume of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$, given by $\\mathrm{Vol}(\\mathbb{CP}^{n}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n}$, is a finite, positive number. Therefore, we can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator, which yields:\n$$ \\bar{s} = C $$\nThis shows that for a metric with constant scalar curvature, its average scalar curvature is equal to that same constant.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the right-hand side of the elliptic equation defining the function $h$:\n$$ s - \\bar{s} = C - C = 0 $$\nThe defining equation for $h$ thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta h = 0 $$\nThis equation states that $h$ is a harmonic function on $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is a compact, connected manifold, a standard result from the theory of elliptic operators (a consequence of the maximum principle) dictates that any harmonic function on it must be a constant. Therefore, $h(p) = K$ for some real constant $K$.\n\nTo determine the value of this constant $K$, we apply the second condition on $h$, the normalization condition:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} h \\, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n} = 0 $$\nSubstituting $h=K$ into this integral gives:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} K \\, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n} = K \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n} = K \\cdot \\mathrm{Vol}(\\mathbb{CP}^{n}) = 0 $$\nAs previously noted, $\\mathrm{Vol}(\\mathbb{CP}^{n})$ is strictly positive. For the product to be zero, the constant $K$ must be zero. Thus, $K=0$.\n\nThis implies that the function $h$ is identically zero on all of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$:\n$$ h \\equiv 0 $$\nFinally, we can compute the Futaki invariant. For any holomorphic vector field $X$, the term $X(h)$ represents the derivative of the function $h$ along $X$. Since $h$ is the zero function, its derivative in any direction is zero.\n$$ X(h) = X(0) = 0 $$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the Futaki invariant, we obtain:\n$$ \\mathrm{Fut}(X) = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} 0 \\cdot \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}^{n} = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} 0 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the Futaki invariant for any holomorphic vector field on $(\\mathbb{CP}^{n}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}})$ is zero.

Thus $k-j > 0$, and the dimension formula $\\dim \\mathcal{F}^j = k-j+1$ is valid.\n$$\nw(k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{ck} (k-j+1)\n$$\nWe evaluate this sum:\n$$\nw(k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{ck} (k+1) - \\sum_{j=1}^{ck} j = (k+1)(ck) - \\frac{ck(ck+1)}{2}\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives a polynomial in $k$:\n$$\nw(k) = ck^2 + ck - \\frac{c^2k^2 + ck}{2} = \\left(c - \\frac{c^2}{2}\\right)k^2 + \\left(c - \\frac{c}{2}\\right)k = \\frac{2c-c^2}{2}k^2 + \\frac{c}{2}k\n$$\nWe write the asymptotic expansion of $w(k)$ in the standard form for dimension $n=1$:\n$$\nw(k) = B_0 k^{n+1} + B_1 k^n + \\dots = B_0 k^2 + B_1 k\n$$\nBy comparing the expressions for $w(k)$, we identify the coefficients:\n$$\nB_0 = \\frac{c(2-c)}{2}, \\quad B_1 = \\frac{c}{2}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Derive the Donaldson–Futaki invariant**\n\nThe Donaldson–Futaki (DF) invariant can be defined in terms of the asymptotic expansion of the average weight per section, $f(k) = w(k)/h(k)$.\n$$\nf(k) = \\frac{B_0 k^2 + B_1 k + O(1)}{A_0 k + A_1 + O(k^{-1})}\n$$\nPerforming polynomial long division for large $k$:\n$$\nf(k) = \\frac{B_0}{A_0}k + \\left(\\frac{B_1}{A_0} - \\frac{A_1 B_0}{A_0^2}\\right) + O(k^{-1}) = \\frac{B_0}{A_0}k + \\frac{A_0 B_1 - A_1 B_0}{A_0^2} + O(k^{-1})\n$$\nThe constant term in this expansion is known as the `slope` of the test configuration. For Fano manifolds, the DF invariant is conventionally defined as the negative of this slope to ensure that K-stability corresponds to a positive invariant.\n$$\n\\mathrm{DF} = - \\frac{A_0 B_1 - A_1 B_0}{A_0^2} = \\frac{A_1 B_0 - A_0 B_1}{A_0^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the coefficient values we found: $A_0=1$, $A_1=1$, $B_0 = \\frac{c(2-c)}{2}$, and $B_1 = \\frac{c}{2}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{DF} = \\frac{(1)\\left(\\frac{c(2-c)}{2}\\right) - (1)\\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)}{1^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{DF} = \\frac{2c - c^2}{2} - \\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{2c - c^2 - c}{2} = \\frac{c - c^2}{2}\n$$\nThe resulting expression for the Donaldson–Futaki invariant is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{DF}(c) = \\frac{c(1-c)}{2}\n$$\nThis expression is an analytic function of $c$. For $c \\in (0,1)$, $\\mathrm{DF}(c)>0$, which is consistent with the known K-stability of the polarized manifold $(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1}(1))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{c(1-c)}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3031577"}]}
