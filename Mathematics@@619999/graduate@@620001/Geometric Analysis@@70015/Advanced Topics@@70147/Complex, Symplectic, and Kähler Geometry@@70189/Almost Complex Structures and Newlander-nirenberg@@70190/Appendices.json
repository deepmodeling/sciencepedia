All definitions and conditions are standard and clearly stated, allowing for a rigorous and unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Eigenbundle Decomposition and Holomorphic Coordinates\n\nAn almost complex structure $J$ on a manifold $M$ is a smooth tensor field of type $(1,1)$ such that $J^2 = -I$, where $I$ is the identity transformation on the tangent bundle $TM$. The given structure $J$ on $M=\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ satisfies this:\n$J(J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k})) = J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$\n$J(J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k})) = J(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}) = -J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}$\nThus, $J^2 = -I$ on the basis vectors, and by linearity, on all of $TM$.\n\nThe endomorphism $J$ extends $\\mathbb{C}$-linearly to the complexified tangent bundle $TM \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$. Since its square is $-I$, its eigenvalues are $\\mathrm{i}$ and $-\\mathrm{i}$. This induces a decomposition of $TM \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$ into two subbundles, the eigenbundles corresponding to these eigenvalues:\n$$\nTM \\otimes \\mathbb{C} = T^{1,0}M \\oplus T^{0,1}M\n$$\nwhere $T^{1,0}M$ is the eigenbundle for the eigenvalue $\\mathrm{i}$ (the $(1,0)$-part), and $T^{0,1}M$ is the eigenbundle for the eigenvalue $-\\mathrm{i}$ (the $(0,1)$-part).\n\nWe first verify that the vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)$ are sections of $T^{1,0}M$. We apply $J$ to $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}$:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}\\right) = J\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the $\\mathbb{C}$-linearity of the extended $J$:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}\\right) - \\mathrm{i}J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $J$ on the basis vector fields:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}} - \\mathrm{i}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}} + \\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\mathrm{i}$:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}\\right) = \\mathrm{i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}\\right) = \\mathrm{i} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}} - \\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}\\right) = \\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}\n$$\nThis shows that for each $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{k}}$ is an eigenvector of $J$ with eigenvalue $\\mathrm{i}$, and is thus a section of $T^{1,0}M$. Since there are $n$ such vector fields and they are linearly independent at every point, they form a frame for the $n$-dimensional complex vector bundle $T^{1,0}M$.\n\nNext, we verify that the coordinate functions $z^k = x^k + \\mathrm{i}y^k$ are holomorphic with respect to $J$. A complex-valued function $f$ is holomorphic (or satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations) with respect to $J$ if its differential $df$ annihilates the $(0,1)$-subbundle, i.e., $df(Z) = 0$ for any $Z \\in \\Gamma(T^{0,1}M)$. This is equivalent to showing that the $(0,1)$-part of its exterior derivative, $\\bar{\\partial}f$, is zero.\n\nThe vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}+\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{j}}\\right)$ form a frame for $T^{0,1}M$. To confirm this, we can check their eigenvalue:\n$J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}) + \\mathrm{i}J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j} - \\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right) = -\\mathrm{i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right) = -\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}$.\n\nTo show that $z^k$ are holomorphic coordinates, we must show that $dz^k(Z) = 0$ for any $Z \\in \\Gamma(T^{0,1}M)$. It suffices to check this on the basis vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}$ for all $j,k \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$.\nThe differential of $z^k$ is $dz^k = d(x^k + \\mathrm{i}y^k) = dx^k + \\mathrm{i}dy^k$.\nWe compute the action of $dz^k$ on $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}$:\n$$\ndz^k\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}\\right) = (dx^k + \\mathrm{i}dy^k)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}+\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{j}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nBy linearity of the duality pairing:\n$$\ndz^k\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(dx^k\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) + \\mathrm{i}dx^k\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{j}}\\right) + \\mathrm{i}dy^k\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) + \\mathrm{i}^2dy^k\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{j}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the standard duality relations $dx^k(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}) = \\delta^k_j$, $dx^k(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j}) = 0$, $dy^k(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}) = 0$, and $dy^k(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j}) = \\delta^k_j$:\n$$\ndz^k\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\delta^k_j + \\mathrm{i}(0) + \\mathrm{i}(0) - \\delta^k_j\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^k_j - \\delta^k_j) = 0\n$$\nSince $dz^k$ vanishes on all basis vectors of $T^{0,1}M$ for all $k$, the functions $z^1, \\dots, z^n$ are indeed holomorphic coordinates for the almost complex structure $J$.\n\nPart 2: Nijenhuis Tensor Calculation\n\nThe Nijenhuis tensor of $J$ is defined as:\n$$\nN_J(X,Y) = [JX,JY] - J[JX,Y] - J[X,JY] - [X,Y]\n$$\nfor any vector fields $X, Y$. The Nijenhuis tensor is a tensor field of type $(1,2)$, which means its value at a point depends only on the values of $X$ and $Y$ at that point. Thus, we can compute it by evaluating it on the basis vector fields spanning the tangent space at any point. We use the real coordinate frame $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right\\}$. A crucial property of these coordinate vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is that their Lie brackets are all zero:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] = 0, \\quad \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] = 0, \\quad \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] = 0\n$$\nfor all indices $k, l \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nWe compute $N_J$ for the three possible pairings of basis vectors:\n\nCase 1: $X=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$, $Y=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}$\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = \\left[J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - J\\left[J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the action of $J$:\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right]\n$$\nSince all Lie brackets of these coordinate vector fields are zero, each term vanishes:\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = 0 - J(0) - J(0) - 0 = 0\n$$\n\nCase 2: $X=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}$, $Y=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}$\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\left[J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - J\\left[J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the action of $J$:\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\left[-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - J\\left[-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right]\n$$\nUsing the properties of the Lie bracket and the fact that they are all zero:\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = 0 - J(0) - J(0) - 0 = 0\n$$\n\nCase 3: $X=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$, $Y=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}$\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\left[J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - J\\left[J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the action of $J$:\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right] - J\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right] - \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right]\n$$\nAgain, all Lie bracket terms are zero:\n$$\nN_J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = 0 - J(0) - J(0) - 0 = 0\n$$\n\nSince the Nijenhuis tensor $N_J$ vanishes on all pairs of basis vectors, and it is a tensor, it must be the zero tensor everywhere on $M$.

Here, $f=\\bar{w}$, $X=\\partial_w$, $g=1$, $Y=\\partial_{\\bar{w}}$.\n$$\nt[\\bar{w}\\,\\partial_{w}, \\partial_{\\bar{w}}] = t \\left( \\bar{w}(\\partial_w 1)\\partial_{\\bar{w}} - 1(\\partial_{\\bar{w}}\\bar{w})\\partial_w + \\bar{w}\\cdot 1[\\partial_w, \\partial_{\\bar{w}}] \\right).\n$$\nSince $\\partial_w(1)=0$ and coordinate vector fields commute ($[\\partial_w, \\partial_{\\bar{w}}]=0$), this simplifies to:\n$$\nt[\\bar{w}\\,\\partial_{w}, \\partial_{\\bar{w}}] = -t (\\partial_{\\bar{w}}\\bar{w})\\partial_w.\n$$\nWe compute the derivative $\\partial_{\\bar{w}}\\bar{w}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\bar{w}}\\bar{w} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_u + \\mathrm{i}\\partial_v)(u - \\mathrm{i}v) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_u(u) - \\mathrm{i}\\partial_u(v) + \\mathrm{i}\\partial_v(u) - \\mathrm{i}^2\\partial_v(v)) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 0 + 0 + 1) = 1.\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we find the Lie bracket:\n$$\n[\\overline{L}_{1}^{(t)}, \\overline{L}_{2}^{(t)}] = -t\\,\\partial_w.\n$$\n\nNow we analyze the integrability for different values of $t$.\n\nCase 1: $t=0$.\nFor $t=0$, the almost complex structure is $J_0$. The bracket is $[\\overline{L}_{1}^{(0)}, \\overline{L}_{2}^{(0)}] = -0 \\cdot \\partial_w = 0$. The zero vector field is trivially in any vector space, including $T^{0,1}_{J_0}$. Thus, the subbundle $T^{0,1}_{J_0}$ is involutive, and by the Newlander-Nirenberg Theorem, $J_0$ is integrable. This is expected, as $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\\mathbb{C}^2$.\n\nCase 2: $t \\neq 0$.\nFor $t \\neq 0$, the bracket is $[\\overline{L}_{1}^{(t)}, \\overline{L}_{2}^{(t)}] = -t\\,\\partial_w$. For $J_t$ to be integrable, this vector field must lie in $T^{0,1}_{J_{t}}$ for all points. This means it must be a linear combination of the basis vectors of $T^{0,1}_{J_{t}}$:\n$$\n-t\\,\\partial_w = A(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w}) \\overline{L}_{1}^{(t)} + B(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w}) \\overline{L}_{2}^{(t)}\n$$\nfor some smooth complex-valued functions $A$ and $B$. Substituting the expressions for the basis vectors:\n$$\n-t\\,\\partial_w = A(\\partial_{\\bar{z}} + t\\,\\bar{w}\\,\\partial_{w}) + B\\partial_{\\bar{w}} = A\\partial_{\\bar{z}} + B\\partial_{\\bar{w}} + (At\\,\\bar{w})\\partial_w.\n$$\nThe set $\\{\\partial_z, \\partial_{\\bar{z}}, \\partial_w, \\partial_{\\bar{w}}\\}$ forms a basis for the complexified tangent space at each point. By comparing coefficients, we must have:\n-   Coefficient of $\\partial_{\\bar{z}}$: $A = 0$.\n-   Coefficient of $\\partial_{\\bar{w}}$: $B = 0$.\n-   Coefficient of $\\partial_w$: $-t = At\\,\\bar{w}$.\nSubstituting $A=0$ into the third equation gives $-t = 0$. This contradicts our assumption that $t \\neq 0$. Therefore, the Lie bracket is not in $T^{0,1}_{J_t}$. The bundle is not involutive, and $J_t$ is not integrable for $t \\neq 0$.\n\nNow we proceed to the second part of the problem. We need to compute the coefficient $c$ in the identity:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\Big(\\text{the $(1,0)$-projection of }[\\overline{L}_{1}^{(t)},\\overline{L}_{2}^{(t)}]\\Big)\\Big|_{(0,0,0,0)} \\;=\\; c\\,\\partial_{w}.\n$$\nThe Nijenhuis tensor $N_{J_t}(\\overline{L}_{1}^{(t)}, \\overline{L}_{2}^{(t)})$ is precisely the $(1,0)$-component of the Lie bracket $[\\overline{L}_{1}^{(t)}, \\overline{L}_{2}^{(t)}]$, where the projection is onto the subbundle $T^{1,0}_{J_t}$. Let $\\pi^{1,0}_t$ denote this projection. The quantity to be computed is:\n$$\nV(t) = \\pi^{1,0}_t\\big([\\overline{L}_{1}^{(t)}, \\overline{L}_{2}^{(t)}]\\big) = \\pi^{1,0}_t(-t\\,\\partial_w).\n$$\nThe basis for the $(1,0)$-subbundle $T^{1,0}_{J_t}$ is $\\{L_1^{(t)}, L_2^{(t)}\\} = \\{\\partial_z + t w \\partial_{\\bar{w}}, \\partial_w\\}$. The vector field $-t\\,\\partial_w$ is simply $-t$ times the basis vector $L_2^{(t)}$. Therefore, it is already an element of $T^{1,0}_{J_t}$. The projection of a vector onto a subspace that already contains it is the vector itself.\n$$\nV(t) = -t\\,\\partial_w.\n$$\nThis is a vector field on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ whose components in the standard basis are constant. Now we compute its derivative with respect to $t$ and evaluate at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} V(t) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} (-t\\,\\partial_w) = -\\partial_w.\n$$\nThis resulting vector field, $-\\partial_w$, is constant on $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The problem requires evaluating this field at the origin $(x,y,u,v)=(0,0,0,0)$.\n$$\n\\Big(-\\partial_w\\Big)\\Big|_{(0,0,0,0)} = -\\partial_w|_{(0,0,0,0)}.\n$$\nWe are asked to find the coefficient $c$ such that this vector equals $c\\,\\partial_w$ at the origin.\n$$\n-\\partial_w|_{(0,0,0,0)} = c\\,\\partial_w|_{(0,0,0,0)}.\n$$\nSince $\\partial_w$ is a non-zero tangent vector at the origin, we can compare the coefficients to find $c$.\n$$\nc = -1.\n$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-1} $$", "id": "3025468"}]}
