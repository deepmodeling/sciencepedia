It describes a canonical example illustrating the isomorphism between Lagrangian Floer homology for cotangent bundles and Morse homology, a foundational result in symplectic topology. The provided data and conditions are complete, consistent, and standard within the field. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the Floer homology $HF(L_0, L_1)$ for two specific Lagrangian submanifolds in the cotangent bundle of the circle, $M=T^*S^1$. The manifold $M$ is equipped with its canonical exact symplectic form $\\omega=d\\lambda$. The first Lagrangian, $L_0$, is the zero section, which can be identified with $S^1$ itself. The second Lagrangian, $L_1$, is the graph of the exact $1$-form $df$, where $f:S^1\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is the Morse function $f(\\theta) = \\varepsilon \\cos\\theta$ for a small positive constant $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n\nThe generators of the Floer chain complex $CF(L_0, L_1)$ correspond to the intersection points of $L_0$ and $L_1$. A point $q \\in T^*S^1$ can be written in local coordinates as $(\\theta, p)$, where $\\theta \\in S^1$ and $p$ is a covector.\nA point in $L_0$ has the form $(\\theta, 0)$.\nA point in $L_1 = \\operatorname{Graph}(df)$ has the form $(\\theta, df_\\theta)$.\nAn intersection point must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, which means $df_\\theta = 0$. The $1$-form $df$ is given by $df = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta)d\\theta = -\\varepsilon \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$.\nThe condition $df_\\theta = 0$ implies $-\\varepsilon \\sin\\theta = 0$, which for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ yields $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$.\nThus, there are two intersection points, which we will denote by $x_0$ (corresponding to $\\theta=0$) and $x_\\pi$ (corresponding to $\\theta=\\pi$). These two points generate the Floer chain complex.\n\nThe problem requires using the identification between Floer theory and Morse theory. The generators of the Floer complex, the intersection points $L_0 \\cap L_1$, correspond to the critical points of the function $f$.\nThe critical points are indeed at $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$. To determine their Morse indices, we compute the second derivative (the Hessian) of $f$:\n$f''(\\theta) = \\frac{d^2}{d\\theta^2}(\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta) = -\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta$.\nAt $\\theta=0$: $f''(0) = -\\varepsilon  0$. This is a non-degenerate maximum, so its Morse index is $1$.\nAt $\\theta=\\pi$: $f''(\\pi) = -\\varepsilon \\cos(\\pi) = \\varepsilon > 0$. This is a non-degenerate minimum, so its Morse index is $0$.\nSo, the generator $x_0$ has Morse index $1$, and the generator $x_\\pi$ has Morse index $0$.\n\nThe Floer differential $\\partial$ is defined by counting rigid $J$-holomorphic strips connecting the intersection points. A strip from a point $y$ to a point $z$ can contribute to the differential $\\partial y$ only if the Maslov index of the strip is $1$. The Floer-Morse isomorphism for this setting implies that the Maslov index difference between intersection points equals the Morse index difference of the corresponding critical points. The differential is a map of degree $-1$.\nThus, the only possible non-zero differential map is from the chain group generated by $x_0$ (degree $1$) to the chain group generated by $x_\\pi$ (degree $0$). The strips we must consider are those that connect $x_0$ to $x_\\pi$.\nThe Floer-Morse isomorphism states that the moduli space of rigid $J$-holomorphic strips between two intersection points is in one-to-one correspondence with the moduli space of gradient flow lines of $-\\nabla f$ (with respect to the metric $g$ that induces $J$) between the corresponding critical points. On $S^1$, the negative gradient flow of $f$ runs from the maximum at $\\theta=0$ down to the minimum at $\\theta=\\pi$. There are two such trajectories, one for each of the two arcs of the circle connecting $0$ and $\\pi$.\n\n1. Computation over $\\mathbb{K}=\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\nThe Floer complex over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is $CF(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2\\langle x_0 \\rangle \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\\langle x_\\pi \\rangle$.\nThe differential $\\partial: CF(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to CF(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is given by counting the number of rigid strips modulo $2$. As established, there are two strips connecting $x_0$ to $x_\\pi$.\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x_\\pi$ in $\\partial x_0$ is $2 \\pmod 2 = 0$.\nThe differential $\\partial x_\\pi$ is zero for grading reasons (or because there are no intersection points of lower index).\nSo, the Floer differential $\\partial$ is the zero map over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe problem asks in what sense the lack of grading data obscures an absolute $\\mathbb{Z}$-grading. Without fixing spin structures and auxiliary data (like a reference trivialization), one cannot assign an absolute integer grading to each generator. We can determine the grading difference, $\\operatorname{deg}(x_0) - \\operatorname{deg}(x_\\pi) = 1$, via the Maslov index. However, the absolute grading of $x_\\pi$ could be any integer $k$, which would fix the grading of $x_0$ to be $k+1$. The Floer homology groups $HF^k$ would depend on this choice. For instance, the homology is $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$, but without an absolute grading, we cannot say it is $HF^1 \\oplus HF^0$ versus, for example, $HF^{101} \\oplus HF^{100}$.\n\n2. Computation over $\\mathbb{K}=\\mathbb{Z}$:\nWith integer coefficients, the differential $\\partial$ requires a signed count of the rigid strips. The signs are determined by a system of coherent orientations on the moduli spaces of holomorphic strips. The problem states that spin and grading data are fixed to make this possible.\nThe power of the Floer-Morse isomorphism is that it is an isomorphism of chain complexes, $(CF(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}), \\partial_F) \\cong (CM(f; \\mathbb{Z}), \\partial_M)$. The homology of the Morse complex, $H_*(CM(f))$, is isomorphic to the singular homology of the underlying manifold, $H_*(S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$.\nWe know the homology of the circle: $H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_0(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe Morse complex for $f$ is $C_k(f) = \\bigoplus_{\\operatorname{crit}_k(f)} \\mathbb{Z}$.\nIn our case, this is $C_1(f) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle x_0 \\rangle$ and $C_0(f) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle x_\\pi \\rangle$. The complex is $0 \\to C_1(f) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} C_0(f) \\to 0$.\nThe homology of this complex is:\n$H_1(f) = \\ker(\\partial_1)$\n$H_0(f) = \\operatorname{coker}(\\partial_1) = C_0(f) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1)$\nFor $H_1(f)$ to be $\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\ker(\\partial_1)$ must be $\\mathbb{Z}\\langle x_0 \\rangle$. This is only possible if the map $\\partial_1$ is the zero map.\nIf $\\partial_1 = 0$, then $H_0(f) = C_0(f) / \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is also correct.\nTherefore, the Morse differential $\\partial_M$ must be zero. By the chain complex isomorphism, the Floer differential $\\partial_F$ must also be zero. This implies that the two rigid strips connecting $x_0$ to $x_\\pi$ must be counted with opposite signs, i.e., $+1$ and $-1$. Their sum is $0$.\nThe degrees of the generators, under an absolute grading compatible with the Morse index, are fixed. The standard convention sets the grading of the minimum of the Morse function to be $0$. Thus, $\\operatorname{deg}(x_\\pi) = 0$. Since the Morse index difference is $1$, we have $\\operatorname{deg}(x_0) = 1$.\n\nFinal computation of the graded Poincaré polynomial:\nThe Floer chain complex over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is given by the chain groups $CF^k = CF_k(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n$CF^1 = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle x_0 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n$CF^0 = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle x_\\pi \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n$CF^k = 0$ for $k \\neq 0, 1$.\nThe Floer differential $\\partial: CF^* \\to CF^{*-1}$ is zero.\nThe Floer homology groups are given by $HF^k(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker(\\partial_k) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_{k+1})$.\nSince $\\partial=0$, we have:\n$HF^1(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker(\\partial_1) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_2) = CF^1 / \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$HF^0(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker(\\partial_0) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1) = CF^0 / \\{0\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nAll other homology groups are zero.\nThe rank of the $k$-th homology group is $\\operatorname{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} HF^k(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n$\\operatorname{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} HF^1 = 1$.\n$\\operatorname{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} HF^0 = 1$.\nThe graded Poincaré polynomial is defined as $P(t) = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\operatorname{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}}HF^k(L_0, L_1;\\mathbb{Z}) \\, t^k$.\nSubstituting the computed ranks, we obtain:\n$P(t) = (1) \\cdot t^1 + (1) \\cdot t^0 = t + 1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1+t}\n$$", "id": "3031655"}, {"introduction": "Having established the connection to Morse theory, we now delve into the crucial and often subtle concept of grading in Floer homology.

It is a well-posed question within the established mathematical framework of symplectic geometry and Lagrangian Floer homology.

We are given the symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega) = (\\mathbb{C}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{std}})$, where we can identify $\\mathbb{C}$ with $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(q,p)$ and the standard symplectic form is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{std}} = dq \\wedge dp$. The complex coordinate is $z=q+ip$. We are also given a trivialization of the canonical bundle $K_M$ by the nowhere-vanishing holomorphic volume form $\\Omega = dz$.\n\nA graded Lagrangian submanifold is a pair $(L, \\tilde{\\alpha}_L)$, where $L$ is a Lagrangian submanifold and $\\tilde{\\alpha}_L: L \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a grading function. This function is a lift of the phase map $\\alpha_L: L \\to S^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}/(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})$. The phase map itself is determined by the trivialization $\\Omega$. For any point $p \\in L$, the phase $\\alpha_L(p)$ is the argument of the complex number obtained by evaluating $\\Omega_p$ on a positively oriented basis of the tangent space $T_p L$. In our one-dimensional case ($n=1$), if $v$ is a positively oriented basis vector of $T_p L$, then $\\alpha_L(p) = \\arg(\\Omega_p(v))$.\n\nLet us compute the phase maps for the given Lagrangians.\nFor $L_0 = \\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{C}$, the tangent space at any point is the real axis itself. We can choose the vector $v_0 = 1$ as a positively oriented basis. The form $\\Omega=dz$ evaluated on this vector is $dz(1) = 1$. The phase is $\\arg(1) = 0$. Thus, the phase map is constantly $\\alpha_{L_0}(p) = 0$ for all $p \\in L_0$. The problem specifies the grading function $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{L_0} \\equiv 0$, which is a valid lift.\n\nFor $L_1 = \\exp(i\\pi/3)\\mathbb{R}$, the tangent space at any point is the line rotated by $\\theta = \\pi/3$. We can choose the vector $v_1 = \\exp(i\\pi/3)$ as a positively oriented basis. The form $\\Omega=dz$ evaluated on this vector is $dz(\\exp(i\\pi/3)) = \\exp(i\\pi/3)$. The phase is $\\arg(\\exp(i\\pi/3)) = \\pi/3$. Thus, the phase map is constantly $\\alpha_{L_1}(p) = \\pi/3$ for all $p \\in L_1$. The problem specifies the grading function $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{L_1} \\equiv \\pi/3$, which is a valid lift.\n\nThe grading of a transverse intersection point $x \\in L_0 \\cap L_1$ between two graded Lagrangians $(L_0, \\tilde{\\alpha}_0)$ and $(L_1, \\tilde{\\alpha}_1)$ is an integer given by the formula:\n$$\n\\deg(x) = I(T_xL_0, T_xL_1) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}_1(x) - \\tilde{\\alpha}_0(x)}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nHere, $I(E, F)$ denotes the Maslov index of the short path of Lagrangian subspaces from $E$ to $F$. The space of Lagrangian subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, denoted $\\Lambda(1)$, is diffeomorphic to the circle $S^1$ (or real projective line $\\mathbb{R}P^1$), which can be parameterized by an angle in $[0, \\pi)$. The Maslov index of a path counts the signed number of times the path crosses a fixed reference point (the Maslov cycle).\nIn our case, the tangent space $T_xL_0$ is the real axis, corresponding to an angle of $0$. The tangent space $T_xL_1$ is the line at an angle of $\\pi/3$. The short path between these two lines in $\\Lambda(1)$ is an arc of length $\\pi/3$. This path does not complete a full circle and does not cross the reference point (which can be chosen, for example, as the vertical line at angle $\\pi/2$). Therefore, the Maslov index of this path is zero: $I(T_xL_0, T_xL_1) = 0$.\n\nNow we can compute the grading of the intersection point $x=0$:\n$$\n\\deg(x) = 0 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}_{L_1}(0) - \\tilde{\\alpha}_{L_0}(0)}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\pi/3 - 0}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 0\n$$\nThus, the grading of the generator $x$ is $0$.\n\nNext, we explain the role of the Maslov class. The Maslov class $\\mu_L$ of a Lagrangian submanifold $L$ is an element of its first cohomology group with integer coefficients, $\\mu_L \\in H^1(L; \\mathbb{Z})$. It is defined as the pullback of the generator of $H^1(\\Lambda(TM); \\mathbb{Z})$ via the Gauss map $g_L: L \\to \\Lambda(TM)$, where $\\Lambda(TM)$ is the Lagrangian Grassmannian bundle over $M$. The Maslov class represents the topological obstruction to lifting the phase map $\\alpha_L: L \\to S^1$ to a single-valued continuous function $\\tilde{\\alpha}_L: L \\to \\mathbb{R}$. For any loop $\\gamma$ in $L$, the change in any grading function $\\tilde{\\alpha}_L$ along this loop is quantized by the Maslov class:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\alpha}_L(\\gamma(1)) - \\tilde{\\alpha}_L(\\gamma(0)) = 2\\pi \\langle \\mu_L, [\\gamma] \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $[\\gamma] \\in H_1(L; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the homology class of the loop.\n\nIn the given problem, the Lagrangian submanifold is $L_1 = \\exp(i\\pi/3)\\mathbb{R}$. As a manifold, $L_1$ is diffeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. The real line is simply connected, meaning its fundamental group is trivial, $\\pi_1(L_1) = \\{e\\}$. Consequently, its first homology and cohomology groups are also trivial: $H_1(L_1; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $H^1(L_1; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This implies that the Maslov class of $L_1$ must be zero: $\\mu_{L_1} = 0$.\n\nThe vanishing of the Maslov class means there is no topological obstruction to defining a global, single-valued grading function on $L_1$. The phase map $\\alpha_{L_1}: L_1 \\to S^1$ is constant and therefore null-homotopic, so it admits a lift to $\\mathbb{R}$. However, this lift is not unique. Any two valid grading functions, say $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{L_1}$ and $\\tilde{\\alpha}'_{L_1}$, must differ by a constant which is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. This corresponds to a deck transformation on the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}$ of $S^1$. Let's write $\\tilde{\\alpha}'_{L_1} = \\tilde{\\alpha}_{L_1} + 2\\pi m$ for some integer $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe problem describes this as \"adding an integer to $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{L_1}$\", which in the context of the universal cover of $S^1 = \\mathbb{R}/(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})$ means adding an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. If we were to change the grading on $L_1$ in this way, the new grading of the intersection point $x$, denoted $\\deg'(x)$, would be:\n$$\n\\deg'(x) = I(T_xL_0, T_xL_1) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}'_{L_1}(x) - \\tilde{\\alpha}_0(x)}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor = 0 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{(\\pi/3 + 2\\pi m) - 0}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1}{3} + 2m \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nSince $m$ is an integer, $\\lfloor 1/3 + 2m \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1/3 \\rfloor + 2m = 0 + 2m = 2m$.\nSo, changing the grading on $L_1$ by a deck transformation corresponding to an integer $m$ changes the grading of the intersection point by $2m$. The Maslov class $\\mu_{L_1}$ controls this ambiguity by being trivial, which guarantees that the only freedom in choosing a grading is this global constant shift, leading to a uniform shift in the degrees of all intersection points.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3031663"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice bridges the gap between the analytic foundations of Floer theory and the topological invariants used for its computation.

Since $\\Phi(t)$ is a path in the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, this is valid. Applying this gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ind}(D) = \\mu_{\\text{RS}}(\\Phi(t)L_0, L_1) = \\mu_{\\text{RS}}(\\Phi(t)^{-1}(\\Phi(t)L_0), \\Phi(t)^{-1}L_1) = \\mu_{\\text{RS}}(L_0, \\Phi(t)^{-1}L_1).\n$$\nThe problem defines the path $\\Lambda(t) := \\Phi(t)^{-1}L_{1}$. Therefore, the Fredholm index is expressed as the Robbin-Salamon index of the pair $(L_{0}, \\Lambda(t))$ over the interval $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ind}(D) = \\mu_{\\text{RS}}(L_0, \\Lambda(t)).\n$$\nWe will now compute this index by following the prescribed method: finding the crossing times and summing the signatures of the corresponding crossing forms.\n\nFirst, we must determine the path of Lagrangians $\\Lambda(t)$. This requires finding the flow $\\Phi(t)$, which is the solution to $\\dot{\\Phi}(t)=J S(t)\\Phi(t)$ with $\\Phi(0)=I$.\nGiven $S(t) = -3\\pi I$, the equation becomes\n$$\n\\dot{\\Phi}(t) = J(-3\\pi I)\\Phi(t) = -3\\pi J \\Phi(t).\n$$\nThis is a linear ordinary differential equation with a constant coefficient matrix $-3\\pi J$. The solution is\n$$\n\\Phi(t) = \\exp(-3\\pi J t) \\Phi(0) = \\exp(-3\\pi J t),\n$$\nsince $\\Phi(0)=I$. The matrix exponential of $\\theta J = \\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to a rotation matrix $R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$. Here, the angle is $-3\\pi t$, so $\\Phi(t)$ represents a clockwise rotation by an angle of $3\\pi t$.\n\nThe path $\\Lambda(t)$ is $\\Phi(t)^{-1}L_1$. The inverse of $\\Phi(t)$ is\n$$\n\\Phi(t)^{-1} = (\\exp(-3\\pi J t))^{-1} = \\exp(3\\pi J t).\n$$\nThis corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by an angle of $3\\pi t$.\nThe Lagrangian subspace $L_0 = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\{0\\}$ is the horizontal axis, which can be identified with the line at angle $0$.\nThe Lagrangian subspace $L_1 = \\exp(J\\beta)L_0$ with $\\beta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is the line obtained by rotating $L_0$ counter-clockwise by $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Thus, $L_1$ is the line making an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ with the positive $x$-axis.\nThe path $\\Lambda(t) = \\Phi(t)^{-1}L_1$ is obtained by rotating $L_1$ counter-clockwise by an angle of $3\\pi t$. Therefore, $\\Lambda(t)$ is a line whose angle with the positive $x$-axis at time $t$ is given by\n$$\n\\theta(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 3\\pi t.\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the crossing times $t \\in [0,1]$ where $\\Lambda(t)$ intersects $L_0$ non-trivially. Since both are lines in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, a non-trivial intersection means they coincide. $L_0$ is the line at angle $0$, so $\\Lambda(t)$ must be the line at angle $k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\nWe set $\\theta(t) = k\\pi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{4} + 3\\pi t = k\\pi \\implies \\frac{1}{4} + 3t = k \\implies t = \\frac{k - 1/4}{3} = \\frac{4k-1}{12}.\n$$\nWe seek solutions for $t$ in the interval $[0,1]$.\nFor $k=1$: $t_1 = \\frac{4(1)-1}{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. This is in $(0,1)$.\nFor $k=2$: $t_2 = \\frac{4(2)-1}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}$. This is in $(0,1)$.\nFor $k=3$: $t_3 = \\frac{4(3)-1}{12} = \\frac{11}{12}$. This is in $(0,1)$.\nFor $k=4$: $t = \\frac{4(4)-1}{12} = \\frac{15}{12}  1$.\nFor $k=0$: $t = \\frac{-1}{12}  0$.\nThus, there are three interior crossing times: $t_1 = \\frac{1}{4}$, $t_2 = \\frac{7}{12}$, and $t_3 = \\frac{11}{12}$.\nAt the endpoints, for $t=0$, $\\theta(0)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, so $L_0 \\cap \\Lambda(0) = L_0 \\cap L_1 = \\{0\\}$. For $t=1$, $\\theta(1)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+3\\pi = \\frac{13\\pi}{4}$, so $L_0 \\cap \\Lambda(1) = \\{0\\}$. The intersections at the endpoints are trivial, so the boundary terms in the Robbin-Salamon formula are zero.\n\nThe Maslov index is the sum of the signatures of the crossing forms at these times:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{RS}}(L_0, \\Lambda(t)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\mathrm{sig}(Q_{t_i}).\n$$\nThe crossing form $Q_{t^*}$ at a crossing time $t^*$ is a quadratic form on the intersection space $V_{t^*} = L_0 \\cap \\Lambda(t^*)$. For a vector $v \\in V_{t^*}$, the form is defined as $Q_{t^*}(v,v) = \\omega(v, \\dot{w}(t^*))$, where $w(t)$ is any path of vectors with $w(t) \\in \\Lambda(t)$ for all $t$ and $w(t^*) = v$. Here, $\\omega=dx \\wedge dy$.\n\nAt each crossing time $t_i$, we have $\\Lambda(t_i) = L_0$, so the intersection space is $L_0 = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\{0\\}$, which is $1$-dimensional. Let's compute the crossing form.\nLet $v = (\\lambda, 0)$ be an arbitrary vector in the intersection space $L_0$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We need a path $w(t) \\in \\Lambda(t)$ such that $w(t_i) = v$.\nA spanning vector for the line $\\Lambda(t)$ is $u(t) = (\\cos\\theta(t), \\sin\\theta(t))$.\nAt a crossing time $t_i$, $\\theta(t_i)=k_i\\pi$, so $u(t_i) = (\\cos(k_i\\pi), \\sin(k_i\\pi)) = ((-1)^{k_i}, 0)$.\nThe vector $v=(\\lambda,0)$ can be written as $v = \\lambda(-1)^{k_i} u(t_i)$. So we can choose the path $w(t) = \\lambda(-1)^{k_i} u(t)$. This path satisfies $w(t) \\in \\Lambda(t)$ and $w(t_i)=v$.\nThe time derivative is $\\dot{w}(t) = \\lambda(-1)^{k_i} \\dot{u}(t)$.\n$\\dot{u}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\cos\\theta(t), \\sin\\theta(t)) = \\dot{\\theta}(t)(-\\sin\\theta(t), \\cos\\theta(t))$.\nThe angular velocity is $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = 3\\pi$, a positive constant.\nAt $t=t_i$, we have\n$$\n\\dot{w}(t_i) = \\lambda(-1)^{k_i} (3\\pi) (-\\sin(k_i\\pi), \\cos(k_i\\pi)) = \\lambda(-1)^{k_i} (3\\pi) (0, (-1)^{k_i}) = (0, 3\\pi\\lambda).\n$$\nNow we compute the value of the crossing form on $v$:\n$$\nQ_{t_i}(v,v) = \\omega(v, \\dot{w}(t_i)) = \\omega((\\lambda, 0), (0, 3\\pi\\lambda)).\n$$\nUsing $\\omega((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1$, we get\n$$\nQ_{t_i}(v,v) = \\lambda(3\\pi\\lambda) - 0(\\lambda) = 3\\pi\\lambda^2.\n$$\nSince $\\lambda$ is the coordinate on the $1$-dimensional space $L_0$, this quadratic form is $q(x) = (3\\pi)x^2$. As $3\\pi  0$, this form is positive definite. A positive definite quadratic form on a $1$-dimensional space has a signature of $+1$.\nThis holds true for all three crossing times $t_1, t_2, t_3$, as the calculation does not depend on the specific value of $k_i$.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{sig}(Q_{t_1}) = +1$, $\\mathrm{sig}(Q_{t_2}) = +1$, and $\\mathrm{sig}(Q_{t_3}) = +1$.\n\nThe total Maslov index is the sum of these signatures:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{RS}}(L_0, \\Lambda(t)) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n$$\nThe Fredholm index of the operator $D$ is therefore $3$.\nThis result is consistent with the geometric intuition that the Maslov index counts the number of times the path of Lagrangians $\\Lambda(t)$ rotates through the fixed Lagrangian $L_0$, weighted by direction. The angle $\\theta(t)$ starts at $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and increases to $\\frac{13\\pi}{4}$, passing through $\\pi$, $2\\pi$, and $3\\pi$. Since the rotation is always in the positive (counter-clockwise) direction ($\\dot{\\theta}(t)=3\\pi0$), each of the three crossings contributes $+1$ to the index.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3031686"}]}
