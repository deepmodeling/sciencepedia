Analysis of the Varifold V and its Mass Measure $\\mu_V$**\nVarifolds are unoriented. The varifold $V_+$ is associated with the rectifiable set $S$ and the integer multiplicity function $\\theta_+(x) = 1$. The varifold $V_-$ is also associated with $S$ and multiplicity $\\theta_-(x) = 1$, as the orientation vector $-\\tau$ is discarded when constructing the varifold. The sum of varifolds $V = V_+ + V_-$ is the varifold associated with the same set $S$ but with the summed multiplicity function $\\theta(x) = \\theta_+(x) + \\theta_-(x) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nThe mass measure $\\mu_V$ of the varifold $V$ associated with the pair $(S, \\theta)$ is given by $\\mu_V = \\theta \\, \\mathcal{H}^1 \\llcorner S$. For our varifold $V$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mu_V = 2 \\, \\mathcal{H}^1 \\llcorner S\n$$\nThis means for any Borel set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$, $\\mu_V(A) = 2 \\, \\mathcal{H}^1(S \\cap A)$. The total mass is $\\mu_V(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 2 \\mathcal{H}^1(S) = 2$. Unlike the current, the varifold mass adds up. **Thus, statement B is correct.**\n\n**C. Analysis of the First Variation $\\delta V$**\nA varifold is stationary if its first variation $\\delta V(X)$ is zero for every smooth compactly supported vector field $X$. The first variation is given by integrating the tangential divergence over the varifold:\n$$\n\\delta V(X) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times G(2,1)} \\mathrm{div}_T X(x) \\, dV(x,T) = \\int_S \\mathrm{div}_{T_x S} X(x) \\, d\\mu_V(x)\n$$\nHere, $T_x S$ is the line spanned by $\\tau = (1,0)$, and $d\\mu_V = 2 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1 \\llcorner S$. For a curve parameterized by arc-length $s$, $\\mathrm{div}_{T_x S} X = \\frac{d}{ds}(X \\cdot \\tau)$. Here, $s$ corresponds to the first coordinate $x_1$ along $S = [0,1] \\times \\{0\\}$. So, $\\mathrm{div}_{T_x S} X = \\frac{\\partial X_1}{\\partial x_1}$.\n$$\n\\delta V(X) = \\int_S \\frac{\\partial X_1}{\\partial x_1} (2 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1) = 2 \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial X_1}{\\partial x_1}(s,0) \\, ds\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, this gives:\n$$\n\\delta V(X) = 2 \\left( X_1(1,0) - X_1(0,0) \\right)\n$$\nThis is not zero for a general $X$. For example, if $X$ is a vector field with $X_1(1,0)=1$ and $X(x)=0$ near $(0,0)$, then $\\delta V(X) = 2 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the varifold is not stationary. The \"cancellation\" logic does not apply to varifolds. **Thus, statement C is incorrect.**\n\n**D. Analysis of the Boundary Current $\\partial T$**\nAs shown in the analysis of A, the current $T$ is the zero current. The boundary of the zero current is also the zero current. So, $\\partial T = 0$.\nAlternatively, one can compute the boundaries of $T_+$ and $T_-$ separately. By Stokes' theorem for currents, $\\partial T_+ = \\delta_{(1,0)} - \\delta_{(0,0)}$ (the boundary of the oriented segment from 0 to 1). Similarly, $T_-$ corresponds to an orientation from 1 to 0, so $\\partial T_- = \\delta_{(0,0)} - \\delta_{(1,0)}$.\nThe sum is $\\partial T = \\partial T_+ + \\partial T_- = (\\delta_{(1,0)} - \\delta_{(0,0)}) + (\\delta_{(0,0)} - \\delta_{(1,0)}) = 0$.\n**Thus, statement D is incorrect.**\n\n**E. Analysis of the Mean Curvature and Boundary Term**\nThe first variation can also be written in terms of the generalized mean curvature vector $H_V$ and a boundary term. For a rectifiable varifold with a piecewise smooth boundary, we have (via integration by parts):\n$$\n\\delta V(X) = -\\int_S \\langle H_V, X \\rangle \\, d\\mu_V + \\int_{\\partial S} \\langle X, \\nu_{\\text{out}} \\rangle \\, d\\mu_V\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_{\\text{out}}$ is the outward-pointing conormal.\nIn our case, the segment $S$ is flat, so its mean curvature is zero in the interior. This means $H_V = 0$ on the interior of $S$. For any vector field $X$ with support contained in the interior of $S$, both $X(0,0)$ and $X(1,0)$ are zero. From our calculation in C, $\\delta V(X) = 2(0-0) = 0$. Since $\\delta V(X) = -\\int_{\\text{int}(S)} \\langle H_V, X \\rangle \\, d\\mu_V = 0$ for all such $X$, it implies $H_V=0$ $\\mu_V$-almost everywhere in the interior of $S$. This confirms the first part of the statement.\nThe second part states that $\\delta V$ is a nonzero measure supported on the endpoints. Our formula $\\delta V(X) = 2(X_1(1,0) - X_1(0,0))$ shows exactly this. This is the \"boundary term\" that arises from integrating the tangential divergence by parts.\n**Thus, statement E is correct.**\n\nFinal conclusion: Statements A, B, and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{A, B, E}}$$", "id": "3036981"}]}
