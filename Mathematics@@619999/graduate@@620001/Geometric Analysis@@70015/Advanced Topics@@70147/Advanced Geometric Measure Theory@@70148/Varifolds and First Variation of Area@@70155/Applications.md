## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

We have spent some time learning the [formal language](@article_id:153144) of [varifolds](@article_id:199207), a bit like learning the rules of grammar and syntax. This is necessary, of course, but it is not the reason we study the subject. The real joy comes when we start to use this language to read—and write—the poetry of the geometric world. The central verb in this poetry is the principle of [first variation](@article_id:174203). The simple-looking statement that the [first variation](@article_id:174203) of a [varifold](@article_id:193517) vanishes, $\delta V = 0$, is a profound declaration of equilibrium. It is the geometer's version of the physicist's principle of least action.

In this chapter, we will embark on a journey to see what this principle *does*. We will see how it gives us a new and more powerful lens through which to view classical objects. We will see how it perfectly describes the delightful shapes of soap films, including their singular junctions. Then, we will dig deeper and discover that this simple condition contains the seeds of a profound structural theory, allowing us to dissect and understand the very nature of singularities. Finally, we will see how [varifolds](@article_id:199207) and the [first variation](@article_id:174203) are not merely descriptive tools but have become central to constructing new geometric worlds and to understanding dynamic processes in fields as diverse as materials science and the theory of [partial differential equations](@article_id:142640).

### The Principle of Least Area: A Modern Perspective

The idea of a "[minimal surface](@article_id:266823)"—a surface that locally minimizes its area—is an old and beautiful one. The [catenoid](@article_id:271133), the shape formed by revolving a [catenary curve](@article_id:177942), has been known and admired since the 18th century. It is the shape a soap film takes when stretched between two circular rings. From a classical viewpoint, it is minimal because its [mean curvature vector](@article_id:199123) $H$ is zero everywhere. How does our new, more abstract framework connect with this? Perfectly. The [first variation](@article_id:174203) formula, in the case of a smooth surface, simplifies beautifully to
$$
\delta V(X) = - \int_{M} \langle H, X \rangle \, d\mu_{M}.
$$
If $H$ is zero everywhere, then naturally $\delta V(X) = 0$ for any vector field $X$. The [catenoid](@article_id:271133) is indeed a [stationary varifold](@article_id:187884) [@problem_id:3036986]. So, our powerful new machinery at least passes the first test: it correctly identifies the old masters.

But the real power of a new idea is not just in confirming what we already know, but in taking us where we couldn't go before. Consider the junction of soap films. If you dip a wireframe in a soap solution, you will often find three films meeting along a curve, and they always meet at angles of $120^\circ$. At this junction, the surface is not smooth; it is not a manifold. Classical [differential geometry](@article_id:145324) struggles here. But for the theory of [varifolds](@article_id:199207), this is no problem at all. A Y-shaped union of three half-planes meeting at $120^\circ$ is a perfectly valid rectifiable [varifold](@article_id:193517). And if we compute its [first variation](@article_id:174203)? We find that it is zero. The [stationarity condition](@article_id:190591), $\delta V = 0$, is satisfied precisely because the [tangent vectors](@article_id:265000) to the three sheets at the junction sum to zero—a perfect balance of forces, just as physical intuition would demand [@problem_id:3037007].

This extends to more complex situations, such as a [minimal surface](@article_id:266823) with a boundary. Imagine a [soap film](@article_id:267134) spanning a wire loop that is then allowed to slide along the surface of a bubble. What shape does the film take? The [first variation](@article_id:174203) principle, when applied to this "free boundary" problem, gives us the complete answer. For variations that keep the boundary of the film on the bubble's surface, the condition $\delta V = 0$ yields two results. In the interior of the film, we get the usual condition: $H=0$. But at the boundary, where the film meets the bubble, we get something new: the film must meet the bubble at a right angle. This orthogonality is not an extra assumption we have to make; it is a direct and elegant consequence of the principle of least area [@problem_id:3036984].

### The Deep Structure of Stationarity: Monotonicity and Regularity

The condition $\delta V=0$ does more than just certify that a given surface is a critical point of area. It imposes incredibly powerful constraints on the *structure* of the [varifold](@article_id:193517). The most fundamental of these is the **Monotonicity Formula**.

Imagine you are looking at a [stationary varifold](@article_id:187884), and you place a small ball $B_r(x_0)$ of radius $r$ centered at a point $x_0$. You compute the "area ratio," which is the area of the [varifold](@article_id:193517) inside the ball divided by the area of a standard $m$-dimensional disk of the same radius:
$$
\theta_{x_0}(r) = \frac{\mu_V(B_r(x_0))}{\omega_m r^m}.
$$
The [monotonicity formula](@article_id:202927), a direct consequence of [stationarity](@article_id:143282), states that this function $\theta_{x_0}(r)$ is *non-decreasing* as you increase the radius $r$. This is a remarkable fact. It means that the area cannot be distributed in just any old way; it has to be "denser" at smaller scales or equally dense. It cannot "thin out" as you approach a point.

Because this function is non-decreasing and bounded below by zero, a [fundamental theorem of calculus](@article_id:146786) tells us that its limit as $r \to 0$ must exist. This limit is called the **density** of the [varifold](@article_id:193517) at $x_0$, denoted $\Theta^m(\mu_V, x_0)$ [@problem_id:3036212] [@problem_id:3036232]. It is a precise, numerical measurement of "how much surface" exists at the infinitesimal scale around $x_0$.

For a smooth point on a surface, the density is simply $1$. But at a singularity, it can be larger. For the Y-junction of soap films, a calculation shows the density at the junction is exactly $\frac{3}{2}$ [@problem_id:3037007]. If we have a [varifold](@article_id:193517) formed by $m$ distinct planes passing through the origin, each with a [multiplicity](@article_id:135972) (think of it as thickness) of $q$, the density at the origin is simply $m \times q$ [@problem_id:3036983]. The density becomes a fingerprint of the singularity.

The ultimate payoff of this machinery is the ability to understand the geometry of singularities. If we take our [varifold](@article_id:193517) and "zoom in" infinitely far at a singular point (a process called taking a blow-up), the [monotonicity formula](@article_id:202927) guarantees that this sequence of magnifications converges to a definite object: a **[tangent cone](@article_id:159192)**. Because [stationarity](@article_id:143282) is preserved by scaling, this tangent cone must itself be a [stationary varifold](@article_id:187884). This tells us something profound: the singularities of [minimal surfaces](@article_id:157238) are not chaotic. They must look, infinitesimally, like cones that are themselves [minimal surfaces](@article_id:157238). For $2$-dimensional surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$, this means singularities look like unions of planes or other well-behaved conical structures whose links on the sphere are networks of geodesics [@problem_id:3036978]. The simple condition $\delta V=0$ has given us a microscope to see, classify, and understand the deep geometric structure of singularities.

### Forging New Worlds: Varifolds as a Constructive Tool

So far, we have used [varifold](@article_id:193517) theory to analyze and describe surfaces. But perhaps its most spectacular application in pure mathematics is as a tool for *construction*—for proving the existence of minimal surfaces that we might not otherwise know how to find.

How does one prove that a minimal surface exists? One of the great challenges in geometry is that the space of all possible surfaces is vast and unwieldy. Finding a "best" one is like finding a needle in an infinite-dimensional haystack. Geometric [measure theory](@article_id:139250), and [varifolds](@article_id:199207) in particular, provide the powerful magnets we need.

One major strategy is the **direct method in the [calculus of variations](@article_id:141740)**, famously used by Schoen and Yau in their work on the positive mass theorem. Suppose you have a given surface $S$ inside a $3$-manifold $M$, like a donut inside a larger, more complicated space. You want to find the surface with the least possible area that can be continuously deformed into $S$ (i.e., is in the same isotopy class). The obvious approach is to take a sequence of surfaces $\Sigma_i$ in this class whose areas get closer and closer to the infimum. The problem is, will this sequence converge to a nice surface? Or will it develop infinitely many wiggles and become pathological?

This is where [varifolds](@article_id:199207) save the day. Allard's [compactness theorem](@article_id:148018) tells us that as long as the areas are bounded, our sequence of surfaces (viewed as [varifolds](@article_id:199207)) will have a convergent subsequence. The limit is a stationary integral [varifold](@article_id:193517) $V$. Lower semicontinuity of mass ensures this limit object is area-minimizing. The next, and hardest, part of the argument is to show that this abstract [varifold](@article_id:193517) $V$ is actually a smooth, embedded surface with the right topology. This requires a deep analysis using [regularity theory](@article_id:193577) and, crucially, a topological assumption on the starting surface: it must be **incompressible**. This condition prevents the minimizing sequence from collapsing or tearing in a way that would change its fundamental shape. In the end, we get what we wanted: a beautiful, smooth, embedded [minimal surface](@article_id:266823) of least area [@problem_id:3033331].

A second, even more powerful strategy is the **min-max theory of Almgren and Pitts**, famously used by Marques and Neves to solve the Willmore conjecture and other outstanding problems. The direct method is great for finding the "valleys" of the area landscape—the stable, area-minimizing surfaces. But what about the "mountain passes"—the [unstable minimal surfaces](@article_id:636480), like the equator of a dumbbell-shaped surface? These are saddle points of the [area functional](@article_id:635471), and they are often even more geometrically interesting.

Min-max theory finds these by considering entire *families* of surfaces, called sweepouts. Imagine a $1$-parameter family of surfaces that starts as a point, expands to fill a region, and then shrinks back to a point. For each such sweepout, we find the surface of maximum area. The [min-max principle](@article_id:149735) then seeks to find the sweepout for which this maximum area is as small as possible. The surface that realizes this "min-max" value is guaranteed to be a minimal surface.

The technical brilliance of this theory lies in its use of two different mathematical spaces at once. The topological part of the argument—defining the sweepouts and their [homotopy classes](@article_id:148871)—is done in the space of cycles with the flat topology. But the analytical part—the "pull-tight" procedure that deforms the sweepout to lower its maximal area—requires the [first variation](@article_id:174203). And as we've seen, the [first variation](@article_id:174203) only behaves well in the space of [varifolds](@article_id:199207). The proof is an incredible synthesis, moving back and forth between the topological world of cycles and the analytical world of [varifolds](@article_id:199207) to build a magnificent geometric object [@problem_id:3025375] [@problem_id:3032202].

### Beyond Equilibrium: Dynamics and Interdisciplinary Bridges

The condition $\delta V=0$ describes a state of perfect geometric equilibrium. But what happens if a surface is not in equilibrium? What if its [first variation](@article_id:174203) is *not* zero? Then, it will tend to move. The [first variation](@article_id:174203) principle becomes a driving force, connecting our static picture to a world of dynamics.

A natural question to ask about a stationary point is whether it is stable. In calculus, we use the [second derivative test](@article_id:137823). In geometry, we use the **[second variation of area](@article_id:187035)**. A [minimal surface](@article_id:266823) is stable if its area does not decrease to second order under any small deformation. This condition is governed by a [differential operator](@article_id:202134) on the surface called the Jacobi operator. Stability is a crucial physical property, and the theory of the second variation is the tool used to analyze it [@problem_id:3036979] [@problem_id:3036974]. As a whole, the objects of our study exist in a hierarchy: all area-minimizing surfaces are stable, and all stable surfaces are stationary (minimal), but the reverse is not true [@problem_id:3033956].

If a surface is not stationary, it will feel a "force" proportional to its [mean curvature vector](@article_id:199123) $H$. The most natural way for it to evolve is to move each point with a velocity equal to its [mean curvature vector](@article_id:199123). This is **Mean Curvature Flow (MCF)**, a geometric version of the heat equation that tends to smooth out and shrink surfaces. This flow is beautiful and important, but it can develop singularities—the surface can pinch off or collapse. How can we describe the flow *through* these singularities? The answer, developed by Kenneth Brakke, is to define a weak "Brakke flow" using the language of [varifolds](@article_id:199207). The evolution is described not by a strict equation but by an inequality, the Brakke inequality, which states that the rate of area loss is controlled by the integral of $|H|^2$. This framework, built upon the [first variation](@article_id:174203), allows the flow to continue in a mathematically rigorous way, even after it ceases to be a smooth surface [@problem_id:2983841].

Perhaps one of the most surprising and beautiful connections is to the field of **phase transitions**. Consider the Allen-Cahn equation, a nonlinear PDE that models the separation of two immiscible fluids, like oil and water. One starts with a [mixed state](@article_id:146517), and as time evolves, the two phases separate, forming a sharp interface between them. The energy of the system is composed of a "gradient energy" (concentrated at the interface) and a "potential energy" (in the bulk regions). The equation seeks to minimize this total energy.

What does this have to do with [varifolds](@article_id:199207)? In the "sharp interface limit," as a parameter $\varepsilon$ representing the thickness of the interface goes to zero, the solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation converge in a remarkable way. The energy of the system concentrates entirely onto a limiting surface, and this surface is—you guessed it—a [stationary varifold](@article_id:187884). The [complex dynamics](@article_id:170698) of the PDE simplify in the limit to the geometric principle of area minimization. The tools of [geometric measure theory](@article_id:187493) provide the exact framework needed to make this connection rigorous and to understand the generalized minimal surfaces that emerge from this physical process [@problem_id:3032472].

From the elegant curve of a soap bubble to the intricate structure of singularities, from the theoretical construction of new geometric forms to the modeling of physical phase transitions, the principle of [first variation](@article_id:174203) has proven to be an astonishingly fertile idea. It shows us, in a way Feynman would have appreciated, how a single, simple principle of equilibrium can unify disparate fields and reveal the inherent beauty and structure of our mathematical and physical world.
