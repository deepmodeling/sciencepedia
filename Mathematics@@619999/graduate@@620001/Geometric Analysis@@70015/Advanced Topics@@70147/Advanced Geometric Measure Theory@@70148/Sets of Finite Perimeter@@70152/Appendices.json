The perimeter of a ball is the $(n-2)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of its boundary sphere. The formula for the surface area of an $m$-dimensional ball $B_R^m$ (i.e., the measure of the sphere $\\partial B_R^m = S_R^{m-1}$) is $m \\omega_m R^{m-1}$.

The total variation is the sum of the absolute values of these jumps: $|1-0| + |0-1| = 1+1=2$.\n- For $x' \\notin B_{r}^{n-1}$, the function is identically zero, so its total variation is $0$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second integral, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}} |D_n(\\chi_E)_{x'}|(\\mathbb{R}) \\, dx' = \\int_{B_{r}^{n-1}} 2 \\, dx' = 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-1}(B_{r}^{n-1})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}^{n-1}(B_{r}^{n-1})$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional Lebesgue measure (volume) of the ball $B_{r}^{n-1}$. The volume of an $m$-dimensional ball $B_R^m$ is given by $\\omega_m R^m$. For the ball $B_{r}^{n-1}$, we have $m=n-1$ and $R=r$. Thus,\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{n-1}(B_{r}^{n-1}) = \\omega_{n-1}r^{n-1}\n$$\nThe value of the second integral is therefore $2\\omega_{n-1}r^{n-1}$.

It is a standard exercise in applying fundamental theorems of geometric analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe problem asks for two things: first, to derive an expression for the perimeter of the set $L(E)$, and second, to verify this result using the area formula.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of $P(L(E))$\n\nThe set $E$ is the open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin, $E = B_{r}(0)$. The map $L$ is given by $L(x) = \\lambda R x$, where $\\lambda > 0$ and $R \\in \\mathrm{SO}(n)$ is a rotation.\n\nFirst, we identify the image set $L(E)$. A rotation is an isometry, meaning it preserves distances from the origin. Therefore, applying the rotation $R$ to the ball $B_r(0)$ results in the same ball: $R(E) = R(B_r(0)) = B_r(0) = E$.\nThe map $L$ is a composition of this rotation and a uniform scaling by a factor of $\\lambda$. Thus, the image set is:\n$$ L(E) = L(B_r(0)) = (\\lambda R)(B_r(0)) = \\lambda(R(B_r(0))) = \\lambda(B_r(0)) $$\nA scaling of an open ball of radius $r$ by a factor $\\lambda$ results in an open ball of radius $\\lambda r$.\n$$ L(E) = B_{\\lambda r}(0) = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : |y| < \\lambda r \\} $$\nThe boundary of $L(E)$ is the sphere of radius $\\lambda r$, denoted $\\partial(B_{\\lambda r}(0))$. This boundary is a smooth ($C^{\\infty}$) hypersurface, and therefore a $C^{1}$ hypersurface.\n\nAccording to the provided principles, for a set $F$ with a $C^{1}$ boundary, its perimeter $P(F)$ is equal to the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of its boundary, $P(F) = \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial F)$. Applying this to our set $L(E) = B_{\\lambda r}(0)$:\n$$ P(L(E)) = \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial(B_{\\lambda r}(0))) $$\nThe problem also provides the formula for the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a sphere of radius $s$: $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial B_s(0)) = n \\omega_n s^{n-1}$.\nBy setting the radius $s = \\lambda r$, we obtain the expression for the perimeter of $L(E)$:\n$$ P(L(E)) = n \\omega_{n} (\\lambda r)^{n-1} = n \\omega_{n} \\lambda^{n-1} r^{n-1} $$\n\n### Part 2: Verification using the Area Formula\n\nWe must now verify that this value equals the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the image of the boundary, $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(L(\\partial E))$, by direct application of the area formula.\n\nThe boundary of $E$ is $\\partial E = \\partial B_r(0)$, the sphere of radius $r$. This is a countably $(n-1)$-rectifiable set. The map is $L(x) = \\lambda R x$, which is a Lipschitz map on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The area formula for a Lipschitz map $f$ and an $(n-1)$-rectifiable set $S$ states:\n$$ \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(f(S)) = \\int_S J_{n-1}f(x) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) $$\nwhere $J_{n-1}f(x)$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional Jacobian of $f$ at $x$, which measures the distortion of $(n-1)$-dimensional volume by the derivative of $f$ acting on the approximate tangent space of $S$ at $x$.\n\nFor our problem, $f=L$ and $S = \\partial E$. The derivative of the linear map $L(x) = \\lambda R x$ is the constant map $DL_x = \\lambda R$.\nFor any point $x \\in \\partial E$, the tangent space $T_x(\\partial E)$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane orthogonal to the position vector $x$. The Jacobian $J_{n-1}L(x)$ is the factor by which the map $DL_x = \\lambda R$ scales $(n-1)$-dimensional volumes in this tangent space.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation $\\lambda R$. It is a composition of a rotation $R$ and a scaling by $\\lambda$.\n1.  A rotation $R \\in \\mathrm{SO}(n)$ is an isometry. When restricted to any subspace, it preserves volumes. Therefore, the $(n-1)$-dimensional Jacobian of the map $x \\mapsto Rx$ is $1$.\n2.  A scaling $S(x) = \\lambda x$ has derivative $DS_x = \\lambda I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. When restricted to any $(n-1)$-dimensional subspace, this map scales all vectors by $\\lambda$, and thus scales $(n-1)$-dimensional volumes by a factor of $\\lambda^{n-1}$.\n\nThe derivative map $DL_x = \\lambda R$ acts on an $(n-1)$-dimensional volume element in $T_x(\\partial E)$ by first rotating it (which does not change its volume) and then scaling it by $\\lambda$ in all directions (which multiplies its volume by $\\lambda^{n-1}$). Therefore, the $(n-1)$-dimensional Jacobian is constant for all $x \\in \\partial E$:\n$$ J_{n-1}L(x) = \\lambda^{n-1} $$\nNow, we apply the area formula:\n$$ \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(L(\\partial E)) = \\int_{\\partial E} J_{n-1}L(x) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) = \\int_{\\partial E} \\lambda^{n-1} \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) $$\nSince $\\lambda^{n-1}$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(L(\\partial E)) = \\lambda^{n-1} \\int_{\\partial E} d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) = \\lambda^{n-1} \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial E) $$\nThe problem provides that $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial E) = \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial B_r(0)) = n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1}$. Substituting this into our expression yields:\n$$ \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(L(\\partial E)) = \\lambda^{n-1} (n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1}) = n \\omega_{n} \\lambda^{n-1} r^{n-1} $$\nThis result matches the expression for $P(L(E))$ derived in the first part. This confirms that for a set with a $C^1$ boundary, the perimeter of its linearly transformed image is equal to the Hausdorff measure of the transformed boundary, and verifies the derived expression.\nThe final expression for the perimeter $P(L(E))$ is $n \\omega_{n} \\lambda^{n-1} r^{n-1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n \\omega_{n} \\lambda^{n-1} r^{n-1}}\n$$", "id": "3033453"}, {"introduction": "The standard perimeter functional is isotropic, meaning it is independent of direction.

The gauge is $\\varphi_{2}(z) = |z|_{2}$.\n    The perimeter is $P_{\\varphi_{2}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial^{*} B_{r}(0)} \\varphi_{2}(\\nu_{E}(x)) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x)$.\n    The reduced boundary is the sphere $\\partial^{*} B_{r}(0) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : |x|_{2} = r\\}$.\n    The outer unit normal at a point $x$ on the sphere is $\\nu_{E}(x) = \\frac{x}{|x|_{2}} = \\frac{x}{r}$.\n    The integrand is $\\varphi_{2}(\\nu_{E}(x)) = |\\nu_{E}(x)|_{2} = \\left|\\frac{x}{r}\\right|_{2} = \\frac{|x|_{2}}{r} = \\frac{r}{r} = 1$.\n    The perimeter integral is again the standard surface area of the boundary:\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{2}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} 1 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) = \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial B_{r}(0)).$$\n    This is the surface area of the $(n-1)$-sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of the unit $(n-1)$-sphere, $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(S^{n-1})$, is related to the volume of the $n$-dimensional unit ball $\\omega_{n}$ by the formula $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(S^{n-1}) = n \\omega_{n}$.\n    By scaling, the surface area of a sphere of radius $r$ is $r^{n-1}$ times the surface area of the unit sphere.\n    So, $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial B_{r}(0)) = r^{n-1} \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(S^{n-1}) = n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1}$.\n    Thus, $P_{\\varphi_{2}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1}$.\n\n4.  **Computation of $P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for a ball.**\n    The set $E$ and domain $\\Omega$ are the same as in the third part. The gauge is $\\varphi_{1}(z) = \\|z\\|_{1}$.\n    The perimeter is $P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} \\varphi_{1}(\\nu_{E}(x)) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x)$.\n    The boundary is $\\partial B_{r}(0)$ and the normal is $\\nu_{E}(x) = x/r$.\n    The integrand is $\\varphi_{1}(\\nu_{E}(x)) = \\|\\frac{x}{r}\\|_{1} = \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i}|$.\n    The integral is:\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x).$$\n    We perform a change of variables $x=ru$, where $u \\in S^{n-1} = \\partial B_{1}(0)$. The surface measure element scales as $d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) = r^{n-1} d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u)$.\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{S^{n-1}} \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |ru_{i}| \\, r^{n-1} d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u) = r^{n-1} \\int_{S^{n-1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u_{i}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u).$$\n    By symmetry of the sphere, the integral of $|u_{i}|$ is the same for any $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$.\n    $$\\int_{S^{n-1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u_{i}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u) = n \\int_{S^{n-1}} |u_{1}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u).$$\n    We compute the integral $I = \\int_{S^{n-1}} |u_{1}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u)$. We can express the integral over $S^{n-1}$ by integrating with respect to the first coordinate $t=u_1$ from $-1$ to $1$, and over the cross-sectional $(n-2)$-spheres of radius $\\sqrt{1-t^2}$.\n    $$I = \\int_{-1}^{1} |t| \\left( \\int_{S^{n-2}_{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}} d\\mathcal{H}^{n-2} \\right) dt,$$\n    where we used the co-area formula with the surface gradient magnitude being $\\sqrt{1-t^2}$. The inner integral is the surface area of an $(n-2)$-sphere of radius $\\sqrt{1-t^2}$, which is $\\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(S^{n-2}) (\\sqrt{1-t^2})^{n-2}$. Using $\\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(S^{n-2}) = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1}$, we get:\n    $$I = \\int_{-1}^{1} |t| \\frac{(n-1)\\omega_{n-1}(1-t^2)^{(n-2)/2}}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}} dt = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\int_{-1}^{1} |t|(1-t^2)^{(n-3)/2} dt.$$\n    The integrand is even, so we can write this as:\n    $$I = 2(n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\int_{0}^{1} t(1-t^2)^{(n-3)/2} dt.$$\n    Let $s=t^2$, so $ds = 2t \\,dt$.\n    $$I = 2(n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\int_{0}^{1} (1-s)^{(n-3)/2} \\frac{ds}{2} = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\left[ -\\frac{(1-s)^{(n-1)/2}}{(n-1)/2} \\right]_{0}^{1}.$$\n    $$I = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\left( 0 - \\left( -\\frac{1}{(n-1)/2} \\right) \\right) = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\frac{2}{n-1} = 2\\omega_{n-1}.$$\n    Substituting this back into the expression for the perimeter:\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = r^{n-1} \\cdot n \\cdot (2\\omega_{n-1}) = 2n\\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1}.$$\n    This completes the four computations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_{n-1} R^{n-1} & \\omega_{n-1} R^{n-1} & n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1} & 2 n \\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3033455"}]}
