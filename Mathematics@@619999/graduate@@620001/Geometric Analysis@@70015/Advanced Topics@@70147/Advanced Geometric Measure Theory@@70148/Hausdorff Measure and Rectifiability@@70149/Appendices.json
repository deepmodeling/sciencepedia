Do not provide a numerical approximation.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Hausdorff dimension of the middle-third Cantor set, $C$, from first principles. Let $C_k$ be the set obtained at the $k$-th step of the construction; it is the union of $2^k$ disjoint closed intervals, each of length $3^{-k}$. The Cantor set is $C = \\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} C_k$.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is the critical exponent $d$ where the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^s(C)$ transitions from $\\infty$ to $0$.

For any $\\delta > 0$, we can choose $k$ large enough so that $3^{-k} \\le \\delta$. The set $C_k$ is a cover for $C$ consisting of $2^k$ intervals, each with diameter $3^{-k}$. Using this as a valid $\\delta$-cover for $C$, we can bound the pre-measure:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{s}_{\\delta}(C) \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{2^k} (3^{-k})^s = 2^k \\cdot (3^{-k})^s = \\left(\\frac{2}{3^s}\\right)^k.\n$$\nIf we choose $s > d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}$, then $3^s > 3^d = 2$, which implies $\\frac{2}{3^s}  1$. As we let $\\delta \\to 0$, we must take $k \\to \\infty$, which causes $(\\frac{2}{3^s})^k \\to 0$. Thus, for any $s > d$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^s(C) = \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\mathcal{H}^s_\\delta(C) = 0.\n$$\nBy definition, $\\dim_H(C) = \\inf\\{ s : \\mathcal{H}^s(C) = 0 \\}$, so we must have $\\dim_H(C) \\le d$.\n\n**Lower Bound on Dimension: $\\dim_H(C) \\ge d$**\n\nTo establish a lower bound, we use the mass distribution principle (an application of Frostman's Lemma). We define a probability measure $\\mu$ on $C$. Let $\\mu$ assign a mass of $1/2^k$ to each of the $2^k$ intervals of $C_k$. The measure $\\mu$ is the weak limit of these measures and is supported on $C$ with $\\mu(C)=1$.\n\nLet $U$ be any set with diameter $r = \\operatorname{diam}(U) > 0$. If $r$ is small, say $r  1/3$, we can choose $k$ such that $3^{-k} \\le r  3^{-(k-1)}$. The intervals of $C_{k-1}$ are separated by gaps of at least $3^{-(k-1)}$. Since $r$ is smaller than this gap length, $U$ can intersect at most one of the $2^{k-1}$ intervals of $C_{k-1}$. The measure of this interval is $1/2^{k-1}$. Thus, $\\mu(U) \\le 1/2^{k-1}$.\nWe relate this to $r^d$. Since $3^d = 2$ and $3^{-k} \\le r$, we have:\n$$\n\\mu(U) \\le \\frac{1}{2^{k-1}} = \\frac{2}{2^k} = \\frac{2}{(3^d)^k} = 2(3^{-k})^d \\le 2r^d = 2(\\operatorname{diam} U)^d.\n$$\nNow let $\\{U_i\\}$ be any $\\delta$-cover of $C$ for $\\delta  1/3$. Then:\n$$\n1 = \\mu(C) \\le \\sum_i \\mu(U_i) \\le \\sum_i 2(\\operatorname{diam} U_i)^d = 2 \\sum_i (\\operatorname{diam} U_i)^d.\n$$\nThis implies $\\sum_i (\\operatorname{diam} U_i)^d \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$. Taking the infimum over all covers gives $\\mathcal{H}^d_\\delta(C) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ for $\\delta  1/3$. In the limit, $\\mathcal{H}^d(C) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor any $s  d$, we have $\\mathcal{H}^s(C) \\ge \\mathcal{H}^d(C) \\cdot \\delta^{s-d}$. Since $s-d  0$, as $\\delta \\to 0$, $\\delta^{s-d} \\to \\infty$. Thus, $\\mathcal{H}^s(C) = \\infty$ for all $s  d$.\nBy definition, $\\dim_H(C) = \\sup\\{ s : \\mathcal{H}^s(C) = \\infty \\}$, so we must have $\\dim_H(C) \\ge d$.\n\nCombining the bounds, we conclude that $\\dim_H(C) = d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}$.\n\n**Value of $\\mathcal{H}^d(C)$**\n\nFrom the upper bound calculation with $s=d$, we have $\\mathcal{H}^d_\\delta(C) \\le (\\frac{2}{3^d})^k = 1^k = 1$ for suitable covers. This implies $\\mathcal{H}^d(C) \\le 1$.\nFrom the lower bound calculation, we have $\\mathcal{H}^d(C) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThus, $\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\mathcal{H}^d(C) \\le 1$, which shows that the measure is finite and strictly positive at the critical dimension.
