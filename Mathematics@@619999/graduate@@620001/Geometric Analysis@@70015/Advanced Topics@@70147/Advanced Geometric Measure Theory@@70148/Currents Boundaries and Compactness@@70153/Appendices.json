For any smooth, compactly supported $1$-form $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{D}^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$, the action of $T$ is given by\n$$\nT(\\omega) = \\int_{S^{1}} \\omega\n$$\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be the linear map defined by $f(x) = 2x$. We are asked to analyze the pushforward current $f_{\\#}T$ and compute the ratio of its mass to the mass of $T$.\n\nFirst, we characterize the pushforward current $f_{\\#}T$. By definition, its action on a test $1$-form $\\omega$ is $f_{\\#}T(\\omega) = T(f^{\\#}\\omega)$, where $f^{\\#}\\omega$ is the pullback of $\\omega$ by $f$. The pullback is defined at a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for a tangent vector $v \\in T_x\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ as\n$$\n(f^{\\#}\\omega)_x(v) = \\omega_{f(x)}(Df_x v)\n$$\nFor the map $f(x) = 2x$, the differential $Df_x$ is the linear map that multiplies vectors by $2$, represented by the matrix $2I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. Thus, $Df_x v = 2v$. Substituting this into the pullback definition, we get\n$$\n(f^{\\#}\\omega)_x(v) = \\omega_{2x}(2v)\n$$\nNow we can compute the action of $f_{\\#}T$:\n$$\nf_{\\#}T(\\omega) = T(f^{\\#}\\omega) = \\int_{S^{1}} f^{\\#}\\omega\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use a parametrization of $S^{1}$. Let $\\gamma: [0, 2\\pi] \\to S^{1}$ be the standard counterclockwise parametrization $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos(t), \\sin(t))$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin(t), \\cos(t))$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{1}} f^{\\#}\\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (f^{\\#}\\omega)_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t)) \\, dt\n$$\nUsing the expression for the pullback, we have:\n$$\n(f^{\\#}\\omega)_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t)) = \\omega_{f(\\gamma(t))}(Df_{\\gamma(t)}\\gamma'(t)) = \\omega_{2\\gamma(t)}(2\\gamma'(t))\n$$\nThe integral for $f_{\\#}T(\\omega)$ is therefore:\n$$\nf_{\\#}T(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\omega_{2\\gamma(t)}(2\\gamma'(t)) \\, dt\n$$\nLet us define a new path $\\eta(t) = f(\\gamma(t)) = 2\\gamma(t)$. This path parametrizes a circle of radius $2$, centered at the origin, which we denote $C_2$. The tangent vector to this new path is $\\eta'(t) = 2\\gamma'(t)$. The integral can be rewritten in terms of $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$:\n$$\nf_{\\#}T(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\omega_{\\eta(t)}(\\eta'(t)) \\, dt = \\int_{C_2} \\omega\n$$\nThis shows that the pushforward current $f_{\\#}T$ is the current associated with integrating $1$-forms over the circle $C_2$ of radius $2$. Since the determinant of the Jacobian $Df_x$ is $\\det(2I) = 4 > 0$, the map $f$ is orientation-preserving. Therefore, $f_{\\#}T$ is the $1$-dimensional integral current with geometric support on the circle of radius $2$, oriented counterclockwise, and with multiplicity $1$.\n\nNext, we compute the masses $M(T)$ and $M(f_{\\#}T)$ and their ratio. The mass of a current $S$ is defined as\n$$\nM(S) = \\sup\\left\\{ S(\\omega) : \\omega \\in \\mathcal{D}^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{2}), \\ \\sup_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\omega_{y}| \\leq 1 \\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $|\\omega_y|$ is the comass of the form $\\omega$ at point $y$, i.e., $|\\omega_y| = \\sup_{|v|=1, v \\in T_y\\mathbb{R}^2} |\\omega_y(v)|$.\nFor the current $T$, which is integration over $S^1$, the mass $M(T)$ is the length of the curve $S^1$.\n$$\nM(T) = \\text{Length}(S^1) = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi\n$$\nTo find the mass of the pushforward, $M(f_{\\#}T)$, we use the definition and the result we just derived for $f_{\\#}T(\\omega)$:\n$$\nM(f_{\\#}T) = \\sup\\left\\{ f_{\\#}T(\\omega) : \\sup_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\omega_{y}| \\leq 1 \\right\\} = \\sup\\left\\{ T(f^{\\#}\\omega) : \\sup_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\omega_{y}| \\leq 1 \\right\\}\n$$\nLet $\\phi = f^{\\#}\\omega$.

Let's compute the comass of $\\phi_x = (f^{\\#}\\omega)_x$:\n$$\n|\\phi_x| = \\sup_{|v|=1} |(f^{\\#}\\omega)_x(v)| = \\sup_{|v|=1} |\\omega_{2x}(2v)|\n$$\nSince $\\omega_{2x}$ is a linear functional on the tangent space, $\\omega_{2x}(2v) = 2\\omega_{2x}(v)$.\n$$\n|\\phi_x| = \\sup_{|v|=1} |2\\omega_{2x}(v)| = 2 \\sup_{|v|=1} |\\omega_{2x}(v)| = 2|\\omega_{2x}|\n$$\nTaking the supremum over all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\phi_x| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} (2|\\omega_{2x}|) = 2 \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\omega_{2x}|\n$$\nSince the map $x \\mapsto 2x$ is a bijection of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ onto itself, the set of values $\\{|\\omega_{2x}|\\}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the same as the set of values $\\{|\\omega_{y}|\\}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus,\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\omega_{2x}| = \\sup_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\omega_y|\n$$\nThis gives us the relationship between the comass of $\\phi$ and $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\phi_x| = 2 \\sup_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\omega_y|\n$$\nThe condition $\\sup_y |\\omega_y| \\leq 1$ is therefore equivalent to $\\sup_x |\\phi_x| \\leq 2$. The map $\\omega \\mapsto f^{\\#}\\omega$ is a linear isomorphism on the space of smooth forms. So, as $\\omega$ ranges over all forms with sup-comass at most $1$, $\\phi=f^{\\#}\\omega$ ranges over all forms with sup-comass at most $2$.\nWe can now rewrite the expression for $M(f_{\\#}T)$:\n$$\nM(f_{\\#}T) = \\sup\\left\\{ T(\\phi) : \\phi \\in \\mathcal{D}^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{2}), \\ \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\phi_x| \\leq 2 \\right\\}\n$$\nLet's introduce a new form $\\psi = \\phi/2$. The condition $\\sup_x |\\phi_x| \\leq 2$ becomes $\\sup_x |2\\psi_x| \\leq 2$, which simplifies to $\\sup_x |\\psi_x| \\leq 1$.\nSince $T$ is a linear functional (a current), $T(\\phi) = T(2\\psi) = 2T(\\psi)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the mass:\n$$\nM(f_{\\#}T) = \\sup\\left\\{ 2T(\\psi) : \\psi \\in \\mathcal{D}^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{2}), \\ \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\psi_x| \\leq 1 \\right\\}\n$$\n$$\nM(f_{\\#}T) = 2 \\cdot \\sup\\left\\{ T(\\psi) : \\psi \\in \\mathcal{D}^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{2}), \\ \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\psi_x| \\leq 1 \\right\\}\n$$\nThe expression inside the supremum is precisely the definition of the mass of the original current, $M(T)$. Therefore, we have derived from first principles that\n$$\nM(f_{\\#}T) = 2 M(T)\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the geometric interpretation: since $f_{\\#}T$ is the current on a circle of radius $2$, its mass is the length of this circle, $M(f_{\\#}T) = 2\\pi(2) = 4\\pi$.

Therefore, as an oriented manifold, $\\partial A_n = C_{1+1/n} - C_1$.\n\nWe can now apply Stokes' Theorem for manifolds with boundary:\n$$\n\\int_{A_n} d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial A_n} \\omega = \\int_{C_{1+1/n}} \\omega - \\int_{C_1} \\omega\n$$\nwhere $d\\omega$ is the exterior derivative of $\\omega$.\nComparing this with our expression for $T_n(\\omega)$, we see that:\n$$\nT_n(\\omega) = \\int_{C_1} \\omega - \\int_{C_{1+1/n}} \\omega = - \\left( \\int_{C_{1+1/n}} \\omega - \\int_{C_1} \\omega \\right) = - \\int_{A_n} d\\omega\n$$\nSince $\\omega$ is a smooth $1$-form, its exterior derivative $d\\omega$ is a smooth $2$-form. We can write $d\\omega = h(x) d\\mathcal{L}^2$ for some smooth function $h(x)$, where $d\\mathcal{L}^2$ is the standard area element in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nSince $\\omega$ has compact support, $d\\omega$ also has compact support. Let this support be $K$. The function $h$ is continuous on the compact set $K$ and zero outside it, so it is bounded. Let $M = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} |h(x)| < \\infty$.\n\nWe can now estimate the magnitude of $T_n(\\omega)$:\n$$\n|T_n(\\omega)| = \\left| - \\int_{A_n} h(x) d\\mathcal{L}^2 \\right| \\leq \\int_{A_n} |h(x)| d\\mathcal{L}^2 \\leq M \\cdot \\text{Area}(A_n)\n$$\nThe area of the annulus $A_n$ is the difference in the areas of the two disks:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(A_n) = \\pi\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2 - \\pi(1)^2 = \\pi\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{n} + \\frac{1}{n^2} - 1\\right) = \\pi\\left(\\frac{2}{n} + \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)\n$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the area of the annulus approaches $0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\text{Area}(A_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\pi\\left(\\frac{2}{n} + \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $|T_n(\\omega)| \\leq M \\cdot \\text{Area}(A_n)$, we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |T_n(\\omega)| = 0\n$$\nThis implies $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} T_n(\\omega) = 0$ for any smooth, compactly supported $1$-form $\\omega$. Therefore, the sequence of currents $\\{T_n\\}_{n\\geq 1}$ converges weakly to the zero current, which we denote as $0$.\n\nThe mass of the limiting current, $M(0)$, is by definition $\\sup \\{0(\\omega) : \\|\\omega\\|_{L^\\infty} \\leq 1\\} = \\sup\\{0\\} = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Convergence of the Varifolds $\\{V_n\\}_{n\\geq 1}$\n\nWe are asked to find the weak limit of the sequence of varifolds $\\{V_n\\}_{n\\geq 1}$ and compute its mass. Weak convergence of varifolds means that for any continuous function $\\phi(x, L)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times G(2,1)$ with compact support, the sequence of real numbers $V_n(\\phi)$ converges to $V(\\phi)$ for some limiting varifold $V$.\n\nThe varifold $V_n$ is defined as the sum $V_n := V_{C_1} + V_{C_{1+1/n}}$. Its action on a test function $\\phi$ is:\n$$\nV_n(\\phi) = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + V_{C_{1+1/n}}(\\phi)\n$$\nThe action of a varifold $V_\\Gamma$ associated with a curve $\\Gamma$ is given by integration over the curve:\n$$\nV_\\Gamma(\\phi) = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\phi(x, T_x\\Gamma) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1(x)\n$$\nwhere $T_x\\Gamma$ is the unoriented tangent line to $\\Gamma$ at $x$.\n\nFor the circle $C_r$, we can use the parameterization $\\gamma_r(t) = (r\\cos t, r\\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The length element is $d\\mathcal{H}^1 = r dt$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma_r'(t) = (-r\\sin t, r\\cos t)$, and the unoriented tangent line $T_{\\gamma_r(t)}C_r$ is the one-dimensional subspace spanned by $(-\\sin t, \\cos t)$. Let us denote this line by $L(t)$, which is independent of the radius $r$.\n\nThe action of $V_{C_r}$ on $\\phi$ is:\n$$\nV_{C_r}(\\phi) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_r(t), L(t)) r \\, dt\n$$\nThus, for $V_n$, we have:\n$$\nV_n(\\phi) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_1(t), L(t)) \\cdot 1 \\, dt + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t)) \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\, dt\n$$\nWe want to find the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. The first term is constant with respect to $n$. For the second term, we consider the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi\\left(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t)\\right) \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\, dt\n$$\nThe test function $\\phi$ is continuous and has compact support. The function $(r,t) \\mapsto \\phi(\\gamma_r(t), L(t))r$ is continuous on $(0, \\infty) \\times [0, 2\\pi]$. As $n\\to\\infty$, $1+1/n \\to 1$ and $\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t) \\to \\gamma_1(t)$ uniformly in $t$. By continuity of $\\phi$, the integrand $\\phi(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t))(1+1/n)$ converges to $\\phi(\\gamma_1(t), L(t)) \\cdot 1$ for each $t$. Since the integration domain $[0, 2\\pi]$ is compact and the integrand is bounded (as $\\phi$ has compact support), we can apply the dominated convergence theorem (or simply the continuity of the parametric integral) to interchange the limit and the integral:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} V_n(\\phi) = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left[ \\phi\\left(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t)\\right) \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\right] dt\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} V_n(\\phi) = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_1(t), L(t)) \\cdot 1 \\, dt = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + V_{C_1}(\\phi) = 2V_{C_1}(\\phi)\n$$\nThis holds for any test function $\\phi$, so the sequence of varifolds $\\{V_n\\}_{n\\geq 1}$ converges weakly to the varifold $V = 2V_{C_1}$. This is the varifold associated with the unit circle $C_1$ with a constant multiplicity of $2$.\n\nThe mass of the limiting varifold $V = 2V_{C_1}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\|V\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = \\|2V_{C_1}\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 2\\|V_{C_1}\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2)\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the mass of a varifold associated with a smooth curve $\\Gamma$ with multiplicity $1$ is its length: $\\|V_{\\Gamma}\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = \\mathcal{H}^1(\\Gamma)$.\nFor the unit circle $C_1$, its length (1D Hausdorff measure) is its circumference:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^1(C_1) = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi\n$$\nTherefore, the mass of the limiting varifold is:\n$$\n\\|V\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^1(C_1) = 2(2\\pi) = 4\\pi\n$$\n\nSummary of results:\n- The mass of the limiting current is $0$.\n- The mass of the limiting varifold is $4\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 4\\pi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3027378"}]}
