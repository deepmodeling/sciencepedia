We evaluate each statement based on the provided definitions.\n\n**A. Evaluation of Cylindrical Height Excess:**\nThe cylindrical height excess is given by $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cyl}}(V,P,R) \\coloneqq \\frac{1}{R^{m+2}} \\int_{(B_R^m \\times \\mathbb{R}) \\cap \\operatorname{spt}\\mu_V} y^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_V$.

The integral is thus $h^2 \\cdot \\mu_V(\\text{disks}) = h^2 \\cdot ( \\omega_m R^m + \\omega_m R^m) = 2h^2\\omega_m R^m$.\nSubstituting this into the excess formula yields:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cyl}}(V,P,R) = \\frac{2h^2\\omega_m R^m}{R^{m+2}} = 2\\omega_m \\left(\\frac{h}{R}\\right)^2. $$\nThis formula is correct. The interpretation that if $h/R$ is not small, the excess is not small and a single-sheeted graph cannot be expected, is also correct. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. Evaluation of Density:**\nLet $z \\in \\operatorname{spt}\\mu_V$, for instance $z \\in P_+$. For a small radius $r  2h$ (the distance between planes), the ball $B_r(z)$ intersects the support of $V$ only on the plane $P_+$. The measure of this intersection is $\\mu_V(B_r(z)) = \\mathcal{H}^m(B_r(z) \\cap P_+) = \\omega_m r^m$.\nThe density is therefore $\\Theta^m(\\mu_V,z) = \\lim_{r \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\omega_m r^m}{\\omega_m r^m} = 1$. The statement claims the density is 2 everywhere on the support, which is false. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Evaluation of Local Regularity:**\nLet $z \\in P_+$. The tangent plane at $z$ is $P_+$ itself. For a small scale $r2h$, the height excess relative to this tangent plane $P_+$ is zero because the support of $V$ inside $B_r(z)$ is contained entirely within $P_+$. Any point $p \\in B_r(z) \\cap P_+$ lies on the plane $P_+$, so its distance to $P_+$ is 0. From B, we know the density at $z$ is 1. The varifold is stationary, so its generalized mean curvature is zero. Thus, all hypotheses of Allard's theorem are met locally at $z$. The theorem's conclusion—that $V$ is a single $C^{1,\\alpha}$ graph near $z$—is true, as $V$ is simply a piece of the smooth plane $P_+$ near $z$. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Evaluation of the Density-1 Hypothesis:**\nConsider the varifold $W \\coloneqq 2\\,\\llbracket P \\rrbracket$ on the plane $P=\\{y=0\\}$. The height excess of $W$ relative to $P$ is identically zero, as the support lies entirely within $P$. Its density at any $z \\in P$ is $\\Theta^m(\\mu_W,z) = \\lim_{r \\downarrow 0} \\frac{2 \\cdot \\omega_m r^m}{\\omega_m r^m} = 2$. Despite having zero excess and zero mean curvature, one cannot conclude single-sheetedness because the density is 2, not 1. This correctly illustrates that the density-1 condition is necessary for the single-sheetedness conclusion. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**E. Evaluation of the Role of Height Excess:**\nThe varifold $V$ is stationary ($\\mathbf{H}_V = 0$), so the mean curvature hypothesis is satisfied. The varifold $V$ is not a single graph over the mid-plane $P$ on a large cylinder $B_R^m \\times \\mathbb{R}$. From A, we know that if $h/R$ is not small, the height excess is large. The failure of single-sheetedness is therefore correctly attributed to the large height excess, as the mean curvature condition is not the cause of the failure.

The support is a smooth manifold, and so the tilt-excess in any small ball will tend to $0$ as the radius of the ball shrinks. This fails the third condition.\n\nConclusion: Option D is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\n\nThe varifold is $V = V_P + V_Q$, where $P, Q \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m+k}$ are orthogonal $m$-planes meeting at the origin, with non-constant density functions.\n\n1.  **Stability**: The second variation is additive. $\\delta^2 V(X,X) = \\delta^2 V_P(X,X) + \\delta^2 V_Q(X,X)$. As established in the analysis of Option A, both $V_P$ and $V_Q$ are stable because they are supported on minimal submanifolds ($P$ and $Q$) with positive multiplicity functions. The sum of two non-negative quantities is non-negative, so $V$ is stable.\n\n2.  **Non-stationarity**: The first variation is also additive: $\\delta V(X) = \\delta V_P(X) + \\delta V_Q(X)$. Since $\\nabla_P(\\theta_P|_P)(0) \\neq 0$, the generalized mean curvature is non-zero at the origin. Thus, the varifold is not stationary.\n\n3.  **Tilt-Excess**: The varifold measure is supported on $(P \\cup Q) \\cap B_r(0)$. The tilt-excess relative to a comparison plane $P'$ is:\n$$E(V, B_r(0); P') = r^{-m} \\left( \\int_{P \\cap B_r(0)} \\|\\pi_P - \\pi_{P'}\\|^2 \\theta_P(x) d\\mathcal{H}^m + \\int_{Q \\cap B_r(0)} \\|\\pi_Q - \\pi_{P'}\\|^2 \\theta_Q(x) d\\mathcal{H}^m \\right)$$\nFor small $r  0$, $\\theta_P(x) \\approx \\theta_P(0) =: c_P  0$ and $\\theta_Q(x) \\approx \\theta_Q(0) =: c_Q  0$. The integral becomes approximately:\n$$E(V, B_r(0); P') \\approx \\omega_m \\left( c_P \\|\\pi_P - \\pi_{P'}\\|^2 + c_Q \\|\\pi_Q - \\pi_{P'}\\|^2 \\right)$$\nThe tilt-excess is the infimum of this quantity over all $m$-planes $P'$. This value is minimized by choosing $P'$ to be either $P$ or $Q$. Assume without loss of generality that we choose $P'=P$. Then the excess is approximately $\\omega_m (c_P \\|\\pi_P - \\pi_P\\|^2 + c_Q \\|\\pi_Q - \\pi_P\\|^2)$. Since $P$ and $Q$ are orthogonal, the Hilbert-Schmidt norm $\\|\\pi_Q - \\pi_P\\|^2 = 2m$. The excess is then approximately $2m \\omega_m c_Q$. This is a positive constant independent of $r$. A similar argument holds if $P'=Q$. The infimum will be $\\min(2m \\omega_m c_Q, 2m \\omega_m c_P)$, which is a positive constant independent of $r$. Therefore, the tilt-excess is bounded below by a positive constant.\n\nConclusion: Option C provides a varifold that is stable, not stationary, and has a tilt-excess in small balls around the origin that is bounded below by a positive constant. It is a valid counterexample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "3025263"}]}
