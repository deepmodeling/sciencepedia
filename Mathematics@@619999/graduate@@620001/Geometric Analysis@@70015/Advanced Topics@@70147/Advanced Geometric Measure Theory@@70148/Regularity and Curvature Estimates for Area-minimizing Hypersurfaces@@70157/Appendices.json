Evaluating the metric at $x=0$:\n$$ g_{ij}(0) = \\delta_{ij} + \\partial_i u(0) \\partial_j u(0) = \\delta_{ij} + 0 = \\delta_{ij} $$\nThus, at $x=0$, the metric is the identity matrix, $g(0) = (\\delta_{ij})$. Consequently, the inverse metric at $x=0$ is also the identity matrix: $g^{ij}(0) = \\delta^{ij}$. This coordinate system is normal at the point $p=F(0)$.\n\nNext, we find the unit normal vector field $N$.

This implies that the covariant derivative at $x=0$ is simply the partial derivative:\n$$ \\nabla_m h_{ij}(0) = \\partial_m h_{ij}(0) $$\nWe now compute this partial derivative.

We are left with:\n$$ \\nabla_m h_{ij}(0) = \\partial_m h_{ij}(0) = \\partial_{mij}u(0) $$\nTherefore, the squared norm of the covariant derivative of the second fundamental form at $x=0$ is:\n$$ |\\nabla A|^2(0) = \\sum_{m,i,j=1}^n (\\partial_{mij}u(0))^2 $$\nThis is the third and final expression.

We choose a system of geodesic normal coordinates $\\{x^1, \\dots, x^n\\}$ centered at $p$. These coordinates are constructed via the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_pM \\to M$.

The point $p$ corresponds to the origin of this coordinate system.\n\n1.  **Metric at $p$**: By construction, the tangent vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ at $p$ are precisely the basis vectors $e_i$. Since $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, the metric components at $p$ are:\n    $$g_{ij}(p) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\bigg|_p, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\bigg|_p\\right) = g(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$$\n    where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\n2.  **Christoffel Symbols at $p$**: In geodesic normal coordinates, geodesics starting at $p$ are represented by straight lines through the origin. The geodesic equation is $\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt}\\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0$. For a radial geodesic $x^i(t) = c^i t$, where $c^i$ are constants, we have $\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0$. Substituting this into the geodesic equation, we find that at the origin ($t=0$, which is $p$), we must have $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) c^i c^j = 0$ for any choice of direction vector $c$. Since $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ is symmetric in $i, j$, this implies that all components of the Christoffel symbols must vanish at $p$:\n    $$\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) = 0$$\n\n3.  **First Derivatives of the Metric at $p$**: The Christoffel symbols are defined by the metric and its first derivatives:\n    $$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl}(\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$$\n    Since $g^{kl}(p) = \\delta^{kl}$ and $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) = 0$, we have at $p$:\n    $$\\partial_i g_{jl}(p) + \\partial_j g_{il}(p) - \\partial_l g_{ij}(p) = 0$$\n    By cyclically permuting the indices $(i, j, l)$ and combining the resulting three equations, for instance $(i,j,l) + (j,l,i) - (l,i,j)$, we can isolate the derivatives to find:\n    $$\\partial_m g_{ij}(p) = 0$$\n    for all $i,j,m$.

To compute its Laplacian, $\\Delta |A|^2 = g^{mn}(|A|^2)_{;mn}$, we first find the covariant derivatives.\nThe first covariant derivative is:\n$$(|A|^2)_{;m} = (g^{ik}g^{jl}h_{ij}h_{kl})_{;m} = g^{ik}g^{jl}(h_{ij;m}h_{kl} + h_{ij}h_{kl;m}) = 2 g^{ik}g^{jl}h_{ij}h_{kl;m}$$\nThe second covariant derivative is:\n$$(|A|^2)_{;mn} = (2 g^{ik}g^{jl}h_{ij}h_{kl;m})_{;n} = 2 g^{ik}g^{jl}(h_{ij;n}h_{kl;m} + h_{ij}h_{kl;mn})$$\nThe Laplacian is obtained by contracting with $g^{mn}$:\n$$\\Delta|A|^2 = g^{mn}(|A|^2)_{;mn} = 2 g^{mn}g^{ik}g^{jl}(h_{ij;n}h_{kl;m} + h_{ij}h_{kl;mn})$$\nLet's evaluate this expression at the point $p$ using the properties of normal coordinates ($g_{ij}(p)=\\delta_{ij}$, $g^{ij}(p)=\\delta^{ij}$, $\\Gamma(p)=0$).\n\\begin{align*} \\Delta|A|^2(p) &= 2 \\delta^{mn}\\delta^{ik}\\delta^{jl}(h_{ij;n}(p)h_{kl;m}(p) + h_{ij}(p)h_{kl;mn}(p)) \\\\ &= 2 \\sum_{i,j,k,l,m,n} \\delta^{mn}\\delta^{ik}\\delta^{jl}(h_{ij;n}h_{kl;m} + h_{ij}h_{kl;mn})\\bigg|_p \\\\ &= 2 \\sum_{i,j,m} h_{ij;m}(p)h_{ij;m}(p) + 2 \\sum_{i,j,k} h_{ij}(p)h_{ij;kk}(p)\\end{align*}\nThe first term is $2|\\nabla A|^2(p)$. The second term involves the rough Laplacian of $h$, $(\\Delta h)_{ij} = g^{kl}h_{ij;kl}$. At $p$, $(\\Delta h)_{ij}(p) = \\sum_k h_{ij;kk}(p)$. Thus, the second term can be written as $2 \\sum_{i,j} h_{ij}(p) (\\Delta h)_{ij}(p) = 2 \\langle A, \\Delta A \\rangle_p$.\nSo, at point $p$, we have:\n$$\\Delta |A|^2(p) = 2 |\\nabla A|^2(p) + 2 \\sum_{i,j,k} h_{ij}(p) h_{ij;kk}(p)$$\n\n### Step 3: Simplification using Gauss-Codazzi Equations and Minimality\n\nOur goal is to express the term $\\sum_{i,j,k} h_{ij}(p) h_{ij;kk}(p)$ using only norms of $A$ and $\\nabla A$. This requires finding an expression for the rough Laplacian $(\\Delta h)_{ij}(p) = \\sum_k h_{ij;kk}(p)$.\n\nWe use the Ricci identity for the commutation of covariant derivatives. The standard formula in Riemannian geometry (Do Carmo's convention for curvature) for a $(0,2)$-tensor $T$ is $T_{ij;kl} - T_{ij;lk} = T_{pj}R^p_{\\;ikl} + T_{ip}R^p_{\\;jkl}$. We also use the Codazzi-Mainardi equation for a hypersurface in a flat ambient space like $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which states $h_{ij;k} = h_{ik;j}$. The minimality condition is that the mean curvature $H=g^{ij}h_{ij}$ is zero everywhere.\n\nLet's compute $(\\Delta h)_{ij} = g^{kl} h_{ij;kl}(p)$.\n$$(\\Delta h)_{ij} = g^{kl}h_{ij;kl} \\stackrel{\\text{Codazzi}}{=} g^{kl}h_{ik;jl}$$\nNow we commute the last two derivatives using the Ricci identity for the tensor $h_{ik}$:\n$$h_{ik;jl} = h_{ik;lj} + h_{mk}R^m_{\\;ijl} + h_{im}R^m_{\\;kjl}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta h_{ij}$:\n$$(\\Delta h)_{ij} = g^{kl}(h_{ik;lj} + h_{mk}R^m_{\\;ijl} + h_{im}R^m_{\\;kjl})$$\nThe first term can be rewritten using Codazzi again: $g^{kl}h_{ik;lj} = g^{kl}(h_{il;k})_{;j} = (g^{kl}h_{il;k})_{;j} = (H_{;i})_{;j}$. Since $M$ is minimal, $H=0$, so its derivatives are also zero. Thus, this term vanishes.\n$$(\\Delta h)_{ij} = g^{kl}h_{mk}R^m_{\\;ijl} + g^{kl}h_{im}R^m_{\\;kjl}$$\nAt point $p$, we have $g^{kl}=\\delta^{kl}, g^{mp}=\\delta^{mp}$, etc.\n$$(\\Delta h)_{ij}(p) = \\sum_{k,m} h_{mk}R_{mijk} + \\sum_m h_{im}R_{mj}$$\nNow we use the Gauss-Codazzi equations to express the curvature of $M$ in terms of $A$. For a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Gauss Equation: $R_{ijkl} = h_{ik}h_{jl} - h_{il}h_{jk}$\n    \\item Ricci Curvature from Gauss: $R_{ik} = g^{jl}R_{jikl} = g^{jl}(h_{ji}h_{lk} - h_{jl}h_{ik}) = Hh_{ik} - g^{jl}h_{jl}h_{ik}$. Since $H=0$, we have $R_{ik} = - \\sum_j h_{ij}h_{jk} = -(A^2)_{ik}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSubstituting these into the expression for $(\\Delta h)_{ij}(p)$:\nThe second term is $\\sum_m h_{im}R_{mj} = \\sum_m h_{im}(-(A^2)_{mj}) = -(A^3)_{ij}$.\nTo evaluate the first term, $\\sum_{k,m} h_{mk}R_{mijk}$, it is simplest to work in the orthonormal basis at $p$ where the symmetric matrix $A=(h_{ij})$ is diagonal, i.e., $h_{ij} = \\lambda_i \\delta_{ij}$.\n$$R_{mijk} = h_{mi}h_{jk} - h_{mj}h_{ik} = (\\lambda_m\\delta_{mi})(\\lambda_j\\delta_{jk}) - (\\lambda_m\\delta_{mj})(\\lambda_k\\delta_{ik})$$\nThe term becomes $\\sum_{k,m} (\\lambda_m\\delta_{mk}) R_{mijk} = \\sum_k \\lambda_k R_{kiik}$.\n$R_{kiik} = h_{ki}h_{ik} - h_{kk}h_{ii}$. In this basis, $h_{ki} = \\lambda_i\\delta_{ki}$ and $h_{ik}=\\lambda_k\\delta_{ik}$. Their product is non-zero only for $k=i$, yielding $\\lambda_i^2$. Also, $h_{kk}=\\lambda_k$ and $h_{ii}=\\lambda_i$.\nSo $R_{kiik} = \\lambda_i^2\\delta_{ki} - \\lambda_k\\lambda_i$.\nThen $\\sum_k \\lambda_k R_{kiik} = \\sum_k \\lambda_k (\\lambda_i^2\\delta_{ki} - \\lambda_k\\lambda_i) = \\lambda_i(\\lambda_i^2) - \\lambda_i\\sum_k \\lambda_k^2 = \\lambda_i^3 - \\lambda_i|A|^2$.\nCombining the two terms for $(\\Delta h)_{ii}$:\n$$(\\Delta h)_{ii}(p) = (\\lambda_i^3 - \\lambda_i|A|^2) + (-(A^3)_{ii}) = (\\lambda_i^3 - \\lambda_i|A|^2) - \\lambda_i^3 = -\\lambda_i|A|^2 = -|A|^2h_{ii}(p)$$\nFor $i\\neq j$, all terms are zero. This gives $(\\Delta h)_{ij}(p) = -|A|^2 h_{ij}(p)$. Since this is a tensorial identity, it holds in any coordinate system.\n\nNow we substitute this back into the expression for $\\Delta|A|^2(p)$:\n$$\\Delta |A|^2(p) = 2 |\\nabla A|^2(p) + 2 \\sum_{i,j} h_{ij}(p) (\\Delta h)_{ij}(p)$$\n$$\\Delta |A|^2(p) = 2 |\\nabla A|^2(p) + 2 \\sum_{i,j} h_{ij}(p) (-|A|^2(p) h_{ij}(p))$$\n$$\\Delta |A|^2(p) = 2 |\\nabla A|^2(p) - 2 |A|^2(p) \\sum_{i,j} h_{ij}(p) h_{ij}(p)$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i,j} h_{ij}(p) h_{ij}(p)$ is simply $|A|^2(p)$ in these coordinates.\n$$\\Delta |A|^2(p) = 2 |\\nabla A|^2(p) - 2 |A|^2(p) |A|^2(p)$$\nTherefore, we arrive at the final expression, which is a version of the Simons' identity for minimal hypersurfaces in Euclidean space:\n$$\\Delta |A|^2(p) = 2 |\\nabla A|^2(p) - 2 |A|^4(p)$$\nThe requested expression is for $\\Delta |A|^2(p)$ evaluated at the point $p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2 |\\nabla A|^{2}(p) - 2 |A|^{4}(p)}\n$$", "id": "3032937"}]}
