In an infinite-dimensional normed space, closed balls are not compact.

So, the sublevel sets are not compact.\n2.  **PS Condition:** The derivative of $J$ at $u$ is the linear functional $v \\mapsto 2\\langle u,v \\rangle_H$. Via the Riesz representation theorem, we identify $J'(u)$ with the element $2u \\in H$. Thus, $\\|J'(u)\\|_H = \\|2u\\|_H = 2\\|u\\|_H$. A PS sequence $\\{u_k\\}$ has $\\|J'(u_k)\\|_H \\to 0$.

Consider a sequence $\\{u_k\\}$ in $\\ker T$ with $\\|u_k\\|_H=1$. Then $J(u_k) = 0$ (so it is bounded) and $J'(u_k) = 2Tu_k = 0$ (so its norm converges to 0). This makes $\\{u_k\\}$ a PS sequence.

Let the integrand be $f(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + \\sqrt{1+t^2} - 1$. A functional of the form $\\int f(u(x)) dx$ is strongly convex if $f''(t)$ is bounded below by a positive constant.

This is because $\\{u_n\\}$ is a PS sequence, so $\\|\\mathcal{J}'(u_n)\\|_H \\to 0$, and the sequence $\\{u_n - u\\}$ is bounded since $u_n$ is bounded and $u$ is its weak limit.\n-   The second term on the right, $\\langle \\mathcal{J}'(u), u_n - u \\rangle$, also converges to 0.
