It is scientifically grounded in the mathematical theory of geometric measure, is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language. All provided givens are consistent and self-contained, forming a standard problem in the study of stationary varifolds.\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze the stationarity of a $2$-dimensional varifold $V$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The varifold is supported on the set $H = H_{0} \\cup H_{1} \\cup H_{2}$, where each $H_{k}$ for $k \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ is a half-plane, and all three half-planes meet along the $z$-axis, which is the line $L := \\{(0,0,z) : z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. The multiplicity of the varifold is given as $1$ on its support $H$.\n\nThe first variation of the varifold $V$ with respect to a compactly supported $C^1$ vector field $X: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is given by\n$$\n\\delta V(X) = \\int \\operatorname{div}_{S} X \\, d\\mu_{V}.\n$$\nThe weight measure $d\\mu_{V}$ is the area measure on $H$ (since the multiplicity is $1$), which is the $2$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^2$. The integral is taken over the support of the varifold, which is $H$. Since $H$ is the union of three distinct sets $H_k$ that only overlap on a set of $\\mathcal{H}^2$-measure zero (the line $L$), we can write the integral as a sum:\n$$\n\\delta V(X) = \\int_{H} \\operatorname{div}_{S} X \\, d\\mathcal{H}^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\int_{H_{k}} \\operatorname{div}_{H_{k}} X \\, d\\mathcal{H}^2.\n$$\nHere, $\\operatorname{div}_{H_{k}} X$ is the tangential divergence of $X$ on the surface $H_k$.\n\nWe apply the divergence theorem for manifolds-with-boundary to each term. For a $2$-dimensional surface $S$ with boundary $\\partial S$, the theorem states:\n$$\n\\int_{S} \\operatorname{div}_{S} X \\, d\\mathcal{H}^2 = \\int_{S} \\langle \\mathbf{H}, X \\rangle \\, d\\mathcal{H}^2 + \\int_{\\partial S} \\langle X, \\nu_{\\text{out}} \\rangle \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{H}$ is the mean curvature vector of $S$ and $\\nu_{\\text{out}}$ is the outward-pointing unit co-normal to the boundary $\\partial S$ (i.e., a vector tangent to $S$, normal to $\\partial S$, and pointing away from $S$).\n\nIn our case, each $H_k$ is a flat half-plane. A flat surface has zero mean curvature, so $\\mathbf{H} = \\vec{0}$ for each $H_k$. The boundary of each half-plane $H_k$ is the line $L$. Therefore, the integral for each $H_k$ simplifies to a boundary integral along $L$:\n$$\n\\int_{H_{k}} \\operatorname{div}_{H_{k}} X \\, d\\mathcal{H}^2 = \\int_{L} \\langle X, \\nu_{k, \\text{out}} \\rangle \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1.\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\nu_k$ is the unit co-normal vector pointing *into* $H_k$. This means $\\nu_k$ is the *inward*-pointing co-normal. The divergence theorem requires the *outward*-pointing co-normal, which is therefore $-\\nu_k$. So, $\\nu_{k, \\text{out}} = -\\nu_k$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{H_{k}} \\operatorname{div}_{H_{k}} X \\, d\\mathcal{H}^2 = \\int_{L} \\langle X, -\\nu_k \\rangle \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1 = - \\int_{L} X \\cdot \\nu_k \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1.\n$$\nSumming the contributions from all three half-planes provides the total first variation:\n$$\n\\delta V(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\left( - \\int_{L} X \\cdot \\nu_k \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1 \\right) = - \\int_{L} X \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\nu_k \\right) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1.\n$$\nThis expression represents the first variation as a line integral along the common boundary $L$.\n\nA varifold $V$ is defined as stationary if its first variation is zero for all compactly supported $C^1$ vector fields $X$. Thus, the condition for stationarity is $\\delta V(X) = 0$, which means:\n$$\n\\int_{L} X \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\nu_k \\right) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all eligible } X.\n$$\nBy the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, if the integral of a product of a continuous function with an arbitrary test function is zero, then the continuous function must be identically zero. This implies that the vector sum of the co-normals must be zero at every point on $L$. The necessary and sufficient condition for stationarity is the balance condition:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\nu_k = \\vec{0}.\n$$\nThe problem asks to evaluate the net edge force vector $F := \\nu_{0} + \\nu_{1} + \\nu_{2}$ at points on $L$. This vector $F$ is precisely the quantity that must vanish for stationarity. We are given the co-normals $\\nu_k = u_k = (\\cos \\theta_k, \\sin \\theta_k, 0)$ with $\\theta_0 = 0$, $\\theta_1 = 2\\pi/3$, and $\\theta_2 = 4\\pi/3$.\n\nLet's compute the vectors:\n- For $k=0$, $\\theta_0 = 0$: $\\nu_0 = (\\cos(0), \\sin(0), 0) = (1, 0, 0)$.\n- For $k=1$, $\\theta_1 = 2\\pi/3$: $\\nu_1 = (\\cos(2\\pi/3), \\sin(2\\pi/3), 0) = (-1/2, \\sqrt{3}/2, 0)$.\n- For $k=2$, $\\theta_2 = 4\\pi/3$: $\\nu_2 = (\\cos(4\\pi/3), \\sin(4\\pi/3), 0) = (-1/2, -\\sqrt{3}/2, 0)$.\n\nNow, we compute the sum $F = \\nu_0 + \\nu_1 + \\nu_2$:\n$$\nF = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}, \\, 0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\, 0 + 0 + 0\\right) = (0, 0, 0) = \\vec{0}.\n$$\nSince the sum is the zero vector, the balance condition is satisfied, and the varifold $V$ is indeed stationary. The calculation task is to compute the magnitude of this vector, $|F|$.\n$$\n|F| = |\\vec{0}| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = 0.\n$$\nThe configuration described is a classic example of a stationary varifold, often referred to as a \"Y-cone\" or a \"tripod\".\n\nRegarding the discussion questions: The reason this configuration cannot be represented as a stationary integral *current* with multiplicity $1$ on each sheet is related to the notion of orientation and boundary. An integral current must be orientable. For the union of the three half-planes $H$ to support an integral current $T = \\sum_{k=0}^2 c_k \\llbracket H_k \\rrbracket$ (where $\\llbracket H_k \\rrbracket$ is the current of integration over an oriented sheet $H_k$ and $c_k$ are integer multiplicities, here $c_k=\\pm 1$), it would need a consistent orientation.\nThe boundary of such a current $T$ is $\\partial T = \\sum_{k=0}^2 c_k \\partial\\llbracket H_k \\rrbracket$. The boundary of each oriented half-plane $\\llbracket H_k \\rrbracket$ is the line $L$ with an orientation (either upward or downward), represented by the current $\\pm \\llbracket L \\rrbracket$. Thus, $\\partial T = (c_0 + c_1 + c_2)\\llbracket L \\rrbracket$. For $T$ to be a cycle (a current with no boundary), we would need $\\partial T=0$. This requires $c_0+c_1+c_2 = 0$. However, since $c_k \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, this sum can never be zero; it can only be $\\pm 1$ or $\\pm 3$. Therefore, $H$ cannot be the support of an integral $2$-cycle with multiplicity $1$ on each sheet. It is fundamentally non-orientable in the sense of cycles. Varifold theory, by being \"unoriented\", readily accommodates such stationary singular configurations.\n\nThe stationarity condition $\\sum \\nu_k = \\vec{0}$ is a direct generalization of the equilibrium condition at a triple junction in a one-dimensional network (like a 2D soap film network). In that context, three curves meeting at a point are in equilibrium if the sum of the tension vectors (tangent vectors scaled by surface tension) is zero. For equal tensions, this means three unit tangent vectors must sum to zero, which forces them to be at $120^\\circ$ angles. Our co-normals $\\nu_k$ play the role of these tension vectors, and the line $L$ is the junction. The angles of $2\\pi/3$ between the planes ensure this force balance is met along the entire singular line.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3033947"}, {"introduction": "To analyze the structure of singular sets, we need quantitative invariants.

Therefore, the dimension of the spine is $s(T) = \\dim(T_x P) = 7$.\n\nThe stratification set $S^k(V)$ is defined as\n$$ S^{k}(V) = \\left\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{spt} V \\;:\\; \\text{for every tangent cone $T$ to $V$ at $x$, one has } s(T) \\le k \\,\\right\\}. $$\nFor our case, we consider $S^{7}(V_P)$. For any point $x \\in \\operatorname{spt} V_P = P$, the unique tangent cone $T$ has a spine of dimension $s(T) = 7$. The condition for a point $x$ to be in $S^{7}(V_P)$ is $s(T) \\le 7$. Since $s(T)=7$ for all $x \\in P$, this condition is always satisfied. Thus,\n$$ S^{7}(V_P) = \\operatorname{spt} V_P = P. $$\nThe Hausdorff dimension of a $7$-dimensional affine plane is $7$. Therefore,\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{7}(V_{P}) = \\dim_{\\mathcal{H}}(P) = 7. $$\nThe general dimension bound $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{k}(V) \\le k$ is satisfied, as we have $k=7$ and $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{7}(V_P) = 7$, so $7 \\le 7$.\n\n**Part 2: The Simons cone $C$**\n\nWe are asked to find $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{0}(V_{C})$. The varifold $V_C$ is induced by the $7$-dimensional Simons cone $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^8$, defined by $C = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 \\times \\mathbb{R}^4 : |x|=|y|\\}$.\n\nThe support of the varifold is $\\operatorname{spt} V_C = C$. The Simons cone $C$ is a smooth manifold everywhere except at the origin, $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^8$. Thus, the singular set of $V_C$ is $\\{0\\}$.\n\nFor any regular point $p \\in C \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the tangent cone is unique and is the $7$-dimensional tangent plane to $C$ at $p$. As this tangent cone is a linear subspace, its spine dimension is $7$.\n\nAt the singular point $p=0$, the tangent cone is the cone $C$ itself. Let's find the dimension of its spine, $s(C)$. The spine of a cone $T$ is the largest linear subspace $L$ such that $T = L \\times T_0$, where $T_0$ is a cone in $L^\\perp$ containing no lines. A cone $T_0$ is said to contain no lines if for any $v \\in T_0 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we have $-v \\notin T_0$.\n\nLet's test if $C$ can be decomposed as $L \\times T_0$ for a non-trivial subspace $L$. Assume $L$ is a non-zero linear subspace. Then there exists a non-zero vector $v=(v_x, v_y) \\in L \\subset C$. Since $v \\in C$, we have $|v_x|=|v_y|$. For the decomposition to hold, for any $v \\in L$ and any $t_0 = (t_x, t_y) \\in T_0$, the vector $v+t_0$ must be in $C$. This means $|v_x+t_x| = |v_y+t_y|$, which upon squaring yields $|v_x|^2 + 2v_x \\cdot t_x + |t_x|^2 = |v_y|^2 + 2v_y \\cdot t_y + |t_y|^2$. Since $v \\in C$ and $t_0 \\in T_0 \\subset C$, we have $|v_x|=|v_y|$ and $|t_x|=|t_y|$. Thus the condition simplifies to $v_x \\cdot t_x = v_y \\cdot t_y$. Because $t_0 \\in L^\\perp$, we must have $v \\cdot t_0 = v_x \\cdot t_x + v_y \\cdot t_y = 0$. Combining these two equations gives $v_x \\cdot t_x = 0$ and $v_y \\cdot t_y = 0$. This must hold for all $v \\in L$ and all $t_0 \\in T_0 = C \\cap L^\\perp$.\nHowever, we can show this fails. Let $v_x = e_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ and $v_y = f_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ be unit vectors. Let $v=(e_1, f_1)$, which is in $C$. Let $L$ be the subspace spanned by $v$. Let $t_0 = (e_1, -f_1)$. Then $|e_1|=|-f_1|=1$, so $t_0 \\in C$. Also, $v \\cdot t_0 = e_1 \\cdot e_1 + f_1 \\cdot (-f_1) = 1-1=0$, so $t_0 \\in L^\\perp$. Thus $t_0 \\in C \\cap L^\\perp$. But $v_x \\cdot t_x = e_1 \\cdot e_1 = 1 \\ne 0$. This violates the condition $v_x \\cdot t_x=0$. This shows that no such non-trivial decomposition exists.\nTherefore, the largest such subspace $L$ is the trivial subspace $L=\\{0\\}$, so the spine dimension is $s(C)=0$.\n\nNow we identify the stratum $S^0(V_C)$. A point $p \\in C$ is in $S^0(V_C)$ if all its tangent cones $T$ satisfy $s(T) \\le 0$, which means $s(T)=0$.\n- For $p \\in C \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the tangent cone is a $7$-plane, with spine dimension $7$. Since $7 \\not\\le 0$, these points are not in $S^0(V_C)$.\n- For $p=0$, the tangent cone is $C$, with spine dimension $s(C)=0$. This satisfies $0 \\le 0$. Thus, $0 \\in S^0(V_C)$.\nIt follows that $S^0(V_C) = \\{0\\}$.\nThe Hausdorff dimension of a single point is $0$. Therefore,\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{0}(V_{C}) = 0. $$\nThe dimension bound is satisfied, as $k=0$ and $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{0}(V_C) = 0$, so $0 \\le 0$.\n\n**Part 3: The product cone $C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$**\n\nWe seek $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{3}(V_{C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3})$. The varifold has dimension $7+3=10$ and its support is $K = C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{11}$.\n\nLet $p=(c,z) \\in K$, where $c \\in C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^8$ and $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- If $c \\ne 0$, $p$ is a regular point of $K$. The tangent cone at $p$ is the tangent space $T_p K = T_c C \\times T_z \\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a $(7+3)=10$-dimensional linear subspace. Its spine dimension is $10$.\n- If $c=0$, $p$ is a singular point. The set of singular points is $\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. At any such point $p=(0,z)$, the tangent cone is the cone $K=C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$ itself (viewed as centered at the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{11}$).\n\nWe need the spine dimension of the tangent cone $T = C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. This cone is a product of the cone $C$ in $\\mathbb{R}^8$ and the linear subspace $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $L = \\{0\\}_{\\mathbb{R}^8} \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a $3$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{11}$. Let $T_0 = C \\times \\{0\\}_{\\mathbb{R}^3}$. This is a cone in $L^{\\perp} = \\mathbb{R}^8 \\times \\{0\\}_{\\mathbb{R}^3}$. The set $T$ can be written as $T = L \\times T_0$, in the sense that $T = \\{l+t_0 : l \\in L, t_0 \\in T_0\\}$. The cone $T_0$ is isometric to $C$, so its spine has dimension $s(C)=0$. This means $T_0$ contains no further line factors. Thus, the spine of $T$ is $L=\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$, and its dimension is $s(T) = \\dim L = 3$.\n\nNow we identify $S^3(V_{C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3})$, the set of points where all tangent cones $T$ have $s(T) \\le 3$.\n- For regular points $(c,z)$ with $c \\ne 0$, the tangent cone has spine dimension $10$. Since $10 \\not\\le 3$, these points are not in $S^3$.\n- For singular points $(0,z)$, the tangent cone is $C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$ with spine dimension $3$. This satisfies $3 \\le 3$. So these points are in $S^3$.\nTherefore, the stratum is the singular set of the varifold:\n$$ S^3(V_{C \\times \\mathbb{R}^3}) = \\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^3. $$\nThis set is a $3$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{11}$. Its Hausdorff dimension is $3$.\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{3}(V_{C\\times \\mathbb{R}^{3}}) = 3. $$\nThe dimension bound is satisfied, as $k=3$ and $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}} S^{3}(V) = 3$, so $3 \\le 3$.\n\nCombining the three results, the required Hausdorff dimensions are $7$, $0$, and $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n7 & 0 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3033955"}]}
