The problem is well-posed and self-contained, providing the definition of the $1$-width in the context of Almgren-Pitts min-max theory. We will follow the outlined procedure, which consists of establishing sharp upper and lower bounds for the width.\n\nFirst, we establish an upper bound for $W_{1}(S^{n+1}, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$. The $1$-width is defined as the infimum of maximal slice areas over all possible sweepouts. Therefore, constructing any valid sweepout provides an upper bound equal to the maximal area of its slices. We consider the canonical sweepout of $S^{n+1}$ by its latitudes. Let $S^{n+1}$ be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ as the set of points $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+2} \\mid \\sum_{i=1}^{n+2} x_i^2 = 1\\}$. We define a height function $h : S^{n+1} \\to [-1, 1]$ by $h(x) = x_{n+2}$. The level sets of this function, $L_c = h^{-1}(c)$ for $c \\in (-1, 1)$, are $(n-1)$-connected, codimension-$1$ submanifolds of $S^{n+1}$. Each $L_c$ is an $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r = \\sqrt{1-c^2}$.\n\nWe can construct a sweepout from these level sets. Let $E_c = \\{ x \\in S^{n+1} \\mid h(x) \\le c \\}$ be the spherical cap \"below\" height $c$. The family of cycles for our sweepout will be $\\Phi_c = \\partial E_c = L_c$. To properly define a sweepout $\\Phi: [0,1] \\to \\mathcal{Z}_{n}(S^{n+1}; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$, we can parameterize $c$ by a parameter $t \\in [0,1]$. A common choice is $c(t) = \\cos(\\pi(1-t))$. For $t=0$, $c(0) = -1$, and $E_{-1}$ is the south pole, whose boundary is empty (the zero cycle). For $t=1$, $c(1)=1$, and $E_1$ is the entire sphere $S^{n+1}$, whose boundary is also empty in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology. The path of cycles $\\Phi(t) = L_{c(t)}$ is continuous in the flat topology and represents a non-trivial element of the first homotopy group of the space of cycles, thus qualifying as a valid sweepout.\n\nThe mass of a cycle $\\Phi(t)$ is its $n$-dimensional area, $\\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t))$. The cycle $\\Phi(t)$ is an $n$-sphere of radius $r(t) = \\sqrt{1 - c(t)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2(\\pi(1-t))} = \\sin(\\pi(1-t))$. The area of an $n$-sphere of radius $r$ is $r^n \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)$, where $\\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)$ is the area of the unit $n$-sphere. Thus, the mass is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t)) = (\\sin(\\pi(1-t)))^n \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)\n$$\nWe need to find the maximum mass for this sweepout:\n$$\n\\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} \\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t)) = \\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} (\\sin(\\pi(1-t)))^n \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)\n$$\nThe supremum is achieved when $\\sin(\\pi(1-t)) = 1$, which occurs at $t = 1/2$. At this point, $c(1/2) = \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$, which corresponds to the totally geodesic equator. The radius is $r=1$. The maximum mass is $(1)^n \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n) = \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)$.\nSince the $1$-width is the infimum over all sweepouts, this particular sweepout provides an upper bound:\n$$\nW_{1}(S^{n+1}, g_{\\mathrm{round}}) \\le \\mathcal{H}^{n}(S^{n})\n$$\n\nNext, we establish a matching lower bound. Let $\\Phi : [0,1] \\to \\mathcal{Z}_{n}(S^{n+1}; \\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ be any valid sweepout. According to the theory of currents, such a path of cycles can be \"filled\" by a family of $(n+1)$-dimensional sets of finite perimeter, $E_t$, such that $\\partial E_t = \\Phi(t)$ for each $t \\in [0,1]$. The function $v(t) = \\operatorname{Vol}(E_t)$ is continuous and maps $[0,1]$ onto $[0, \\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n+1})]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, for any volume $v^* \\in [0, \\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n+1})]$, there exists a $t^* \\in [0,1]$ such that $\\operatorname{Vol}(E_{t^*}) = v^*$.\n\nThe isoperimetric profile $I(v)$ gives the minimum possible $n$-area of the boundary of any region with $(n+1)$-volume $v$. For the region $E_{t^*}$ with volume $v^*$, its boundary $\\Phi(t^*)$ must have an area at least as large as the isoperimetric minimum:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t^*)) \\ge I(v^*)\n$$\nThe maximal mass of the sweepout is $\\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} \\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t))$. We have:\n$$\n\\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} \\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t)) \\ge \\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t^*)) \\ge I(v^*)\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any $v^* \\in [0, \\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n+1})]$. Thus, we can take the supremum over all possible values of $v^*$:\n$$\n\\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} \\mathbf{M}(\\Phi(t)) \\ge \\sup_{v^* \\in [0, \\operatorname{Vol}(S^{n+1})]} I(v^*) = \\max_{v} I(v)\n$$\nThis holds for an arbitrary sweepout $\\Phi$.

Their boundaries are geodesic spheres. Let's find the maximum possible area of such a boundary. A geodesic sphere on $S^{n+1}$ is determined by a geodesic distance $\\rho \\in [0, \\pi]$ from a center point. Such a sphere is isometric to a standard Euclidean $n$-sphere of radius $\\sin(\\rho)$. Its $n$-area is $A(\\rho) = (\\sin \\rho)^n \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)$. The function $I(v)$ is simply a reparameterization of $A(\\rho)$. To find $\\max_v I(v)$, we can maximize $A(\\rho)$ for $\\rho \\in [0, \\pi]$. The function $A(\\rho)$ is maximized when $\\sin \\rho$ is maximized, i.e., $\\sin \\rho = 1$, which occurs at $\\rho = \\pi/2$. This corresponds to a hemisphere, whose boundary is the totally geodesic equator. The area of the equator is $A(\\pi/2) = (1)^n \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n) = \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)$.\nTherefore, $\\max_v I(v) = \\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)$, and our lower bound is:\n$$\nW_{1}(S^{n+1}, g_{\\mathrm{round}}) \\ge \\mathcal{H}^{n}(S^{n})\n$$\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{n}(S^{n}) \\le W_{1}(S^{n+1}, g_{\\mathrm{round}}) \\le \\mathcal{H}^{n}(S^{n})\n$$\nThis implies that the width must be exactly equal to the area of the unit $n$-sphere:\n$$\nW_{1}(S^{n+1}, g_{\\mathrm{round}}) = \\mathcal{H}^{n}(S^{n})\n$$\nThe final step is to provide the closed-form expression for the $n$-dimensional area (or volume) of the unit $n$-sphere, $\\mathcal{H}^n(S^n)$. This is given by the well-known formula involving the Gamma function:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{n}(S^{n}) = \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression represents the $1$-width of the $(n+1)$-sphere.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "3025358"}, {"introduction": "After a min-max procedure yields a minimal hypersurface, the next step is to analyze its stability.

By definition, a submanifold is totally geodesic if its second fundamental form $A$ vanishes identically. Therefore, for the equatorial $S^n$, we have $A=0$, which implies that its squared norm is $|A|^2 = 0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the Ricci curvature term. The ambient manifold is the unit sphere $S^{n+1}$, which has constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For a Riemannian manifold of dimension $m$ and constant sectional curvature $K$, its Ricci tensor is given by $\\operatorname{Ric} = (m-1)K g$, where $g$ is the metric tensor. In our case, the ambient manifold is $S^{n+1}$, so its dimension is $m=n+1$. With $K=1$, the Ricci tensor of $S^{n+1}$ is $\\operatorname{Ric} = ((n+1)-1)(1)g = ng$.

We can factor this polynomial as:\n$$\n(k-1)(k+n) = 0.\n$$\nThe roots are $k=1$ and $k=-n$. The quadratic expression $(k-1)(k+n)$ represents a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative for values of $k$ strictly between its roots:\n$$\n-n < k < 1.\n$$\nSince $k$ must be a non-negative integer ($k \\ge 0$), the only integer value satisfying this inequality is $k=0$.\n\nFor $k=0$, the eigenvalue of $J$ is $\\mu_0 = (0-1)(0+n) = -n$.

The option claims Frankel’s property holds and furthermore that any min–max limit must be a single connected minimal torus.
