This sequence converges in the $C^2$ topology to a smooth metric $(S^2, g_{\\infty})$ with constant sectional curvature $\\kappa_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The Riemann curvature tensors $\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i}$ also converge to $\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_{\\infty}}$ in the $C^k$ topology for $k \\ge 0$, which is a consequence of $C^2$ metric convergence. We proceed to solve the four parts of the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Estimate for the Difference in Sectional Curvatures\n\nLet $p \\in S^2$ be an arbitrary point, and let $\\Pi \\subset T_p S^2$ be an arbitrary $2$-dimensional subspace (a $2$-plane). The sectional curvature $K_g(\\Pi)$ of $\\Pi$ with respect to a metric $g$ is defined as\n$$K_g(\\Pi) = \\frac{\\langle \\operatorname{Rm}_g(u, v)v, u \\rangle_g}{\\langle u, u \\rangle_g \\langle v, v \\rangle_g - \\langle u, v \\rangle_g^2}$$\nwhere $\\{u, v\\}$ is any basis for $\\Pi$ and $\\operatorname{Rm}_g$ is the $(1,3)$-Riemann curvature tensor. In terms of the $(0,4)$-tensor, this is\n$$K_g(\\Pi) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Rm}_g(u, v, u, v)}{g(u, u)g(v, v) - g(u, v)^2}$$\nLet us choose a basis $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ for $\\Pi$ that is orthonormal with respect to the limit metric $g_\\infty$. Thus, $g_\\infty(e_a, e_b) = \\delta_{ab}$ for $a, b \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFor the metric $g_\\infty$, the denominator is $g_\\infty(e_1, e_1)g_\\infty(e_2, e_2) - g_\\infty(e_1, e_2)^2 = 1 \\cdot 1 - 0^2 = 1$. The sectional curvature is\n$$K_{g_{\\infty}}(\\Pi) = \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_{\\infty}}(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2)$$\nFor the metric $g_i$, let $h_i = g_i - g_\\infty$ be the tensor difference. At $p$, we have $g_i(e_a, e_b) = g_\\infty(e_a, e_b) + h_i(e_a, e_b) = \\delta_{ab} + h_i(e_a, e_b)$.\nThe denominator for $K_{g_i}(\\Pi)$ is\n$$D_i = g_i(e_1, e_1)g_i(e_2, e_2) - (g_i(e_1, e_2))^2 = (1 + h_i(e_1, e_1))(1 + h_i(e_2, e_2)) - (h_i(e_1, e_2))^2$$\n$$D_i = 1 + h_i(e_1, e_1) + h_i(e_2, e_2) + h_i(e_1, e_1)h_i(e_2, e_2) - (h_i(e_1, e_2))^2$$\nThe numerator is $N_i = \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i}(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2)$.\nSo, the sectional curvature for $g_i$ is $K_{g_i}(\\Pi) = N_i/D_i$.\nThe difference in sectional curvatures is\n$$|K_{g_i}(\\Pi) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi)| = \\left| \\frac{N_i}{D_i} - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) \\right| = \\frac{|N_i - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) D_i|}{|D_i|}$$\nLet's analyze the numerator. Let $\\Delta\\operatorname{Rm}_i = \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i} - \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}$.\n$$N_i = \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2) + \\Delta\\operatorname{Rm}_i(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2) = K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) + \\Delta\\operatorname{Rm}_i(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2)$$\nSo the numerator becomes:\n\\begin{align*} N_i - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) D_i &= \\left(K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) + \\Delta\\operatorname{Rm}_i(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2)\\right) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) \\left(1 + h_i(e_1, e_1) + h_i(e_2, e_2) + \\dots\\right) \\\\ &= \\Delta\\operatorname{Rm}_i(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) \\left(h_i(e_1, e_1) + h_i(e_2, e_2)\\right) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi) \\left(h_i(e_1, e_1)h_i(e_2, e_2) - (h_i(e_1, e_2))^2\\right) \\end{align*}\nWe use the $C^0$ norm for tensors on $S^2$. For a $(0,m)$-tensor $T$, $\\|T\\|_{C^0(S^2)} = \\sup_{p \\in S^2} |T_p|_{g_\\infty}$, where $|T_p|_{g_\\infty} = \\sup_{v_j \\in T_pS^2, |v_j|_{g_\\infty}=1} |T_p(v_1, \\dots, v_m)|$.\nSince $|e_1|_{g_\\infty} = |e_2|_{g_\\infty} = 1$, we can bound the terms:\n$$|\\Delta\\operatorname{Rm}_i(e_1, e_2, e_1, e_2)| \\le \\|\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i} - \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}\\|_{C^0(S^2)}$$\n$$|h_i(e_a, e_b)| \\le \\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0(S^2)}$$\nLet $C_K = \\sup_{p, \\Pi} |K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi)| = |\\kappa_\\infty| = \\frac{1}{4}$, since $g_\\infty$ has constant sectional curvature.\n$$|K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi)(h_i(e_1, e_1) + h_i(e_2, e_2))| \\le C_K (|h_i(e_1, e_1)| + |h_i(e_2, e_2)|) \\le 2 C_K \\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0(S^2)}$$\nThe quadratic term is bounded by $2 C_K \\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0(S^2)}^2$.\nAs $g_i \\to g_\\infty$ in $C^0$, for $i$ large enough, $\\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0(S^2)} < 1$, say. Then the quadratic term is smaller than the linear term.\nAlso, $D_i \\to 1$ uniformly on $S^2$. So for $i$ large enough, we have, for example, $|D_i| > 1/2$. Thus $|D_i|^{-1}$ is uniformly bounded, say by $2$.\nCombining these estimates, we get:\n$$|K_{g_i}(\\Pi) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi)| \\le \\frac{1}{|D_i|} \\left( \\|\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i} - \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}\\|_{C^0} + 2C_K \\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0} + 2C_K \\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0}^2 \\right)$$\nFor $i$ large enough, we can find a constant $C$ such that this implies a linear estimate:\n$$|K_{g_i}(\\Pi) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi)| \\le C \\left( \\|\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i} - \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}\\|_{C^0(S^2)} + \\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0(S^2)} \\right)$$\nThis estimate holds for any point $p \\in S^2$ and any plane $\\Pi \\subset T_p S^2$.\n\n### Part 2: Uniform Convergence of Sectional Curvatures\n\nThe estimate derived above is uniform. The constant $C$ and the right-hand side do not depend on the point $p$ or the plane $\\Pi$. Let's denote $K_{g_i}$ and $K_{g_\\infty}$ as functions on the Grassmann bundle of $2$-planes over $S^2$.\nThe uniform convergence of the sectional curvatures means that $\\|K_{g_i} - K_{g_\\infty}\\|_{C^0} \\to 0$, which is to say\n$$\\sup_{p \\in S^2} \\sup_{\\Pi \\subset T_p S^2} |K_{g_i}(\\Pi) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi)| \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } i \\to \\infty$$\nFrom our estimate:\n$$\\sup_{p, \\Pi} |K_{g_i}(\\Pi) - K_{g_\\infty}(\\Pi)| \\le C \\left( \\|\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i} - \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}\\|_{C^0(S^2)} + \\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0(S^2)} \\right)$$\nThe problem states that $g_i \\to g_\\infty$ in the $C^2$ topology. This implies convergence in the $C^0$ topology, so $\\|g_i - g_\\infty\\|_{C^0(S^2)} \\to 0$. It also implies that the curvature tensors converge in the $C^0$ topology, so $\\|\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i} - \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}\\|_{C^0(S^2)} \\to 0$.\nSince both terms on the right-hand side of the inequality go to $0$ as $i \\to \\infty$, the left-hand side must also go to $0$. This demonstrates the uniform convergence of the sectional curvatures, $K_{g_i} \\to K_{g_\\infty}$.\n\n### Part 3: Convergence of the Injectivity Radius\n\nThe injectivity radius of a compact Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is given by $\\operatorname{inj}(M, g) = \\inf_{p \\in M} \\operatorname{inj}(M, g)_p$. The injectivity radius at a point $p$, $\\operatorname{inj}(M, g)_p$, is the minimum of two quantities:\n$1$. The conjugate radius $i_c(p)$, which is the shortest distance from $p$ to a conjugate point along any geodesic starting at $p$.\n$2$. Half the length of the shortest non-trivial geodesic loop starting and ending at $p$, denoted $\\frac{1}{2} L(p)$.\n\nA point $q = \\gamma(\\tau)$ is conjugate to $p=\\gamma(0)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(\\tau) = 0$. The Jacobi equation is a second-order linear ODE:\n$$\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\nabla_{\\gamma'} J(t) + \\operatorname{Rm}_g(J(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$.\nThe convergence $g_i \\to g_\\infty$ in $C^2$ implies that the Christoffel symbols of $g_i$ converge in $C^1$ to those of $g_\\infty$, and the curvature tensors $\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i}$ converge in $C^0$ to $\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}$.\nLet $\\gamma_\\infty$ be a geodesic for $g_\\infty$ with $\\gamma_\\infty(0) = p$ and $\\gamma_\\infty'(0) = v$. Let $\\gamma_i$ be the corresponding geodesic for $g_i$ with the same initial data. Due to the $C^1$ convergence of the Christoffel symbols, the solutions to the geodesic equation converge: $\\gamma_i \\to \\gamma_\\infty$ in $C^2$ on any finite time interval.\nThe coefficients of the Jacobi equation for $g_i$ along $\\gamma_i$ depend on $\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i}$ and $\\gamma_i'$. Since $\\operatorname{Rm}_{g_i} \\to \\operatorname{Rm}_{g_\\infty}$ and $\\gamma_i \\to \\gamma_\\infty$ uniformly, the coefficients of the Jacobi ODE for $g_i$ converge uniformly to those for $g_\\infty$.\nBy the theorem on continuous dependence of solutions of ODEs on parameters, for given initial conditions (e.g., $J(0)=0$, $J'(0)=w$), the solutions $J_i(t)$ converge uniformly to $J_\\infty(t)$. This implies that their zeros also converge.\nThis must hold for all initial directions $v$ and all initial Jacobi field derivatives $w$. Since the space of these directions and derivatives (the unit sphere bundles) is compact, the convergence of the first zero is uniform. Thus, the conjugate radius $i_{c,g_i}(p)$ converges to $i_{c,g_\\infty}(p)$.\nSimilarly, the $C^2$ convergence of the metrics implies $C^1$ convergence ($g_i \\to g_\\infty$ and $\\nabla^i \\to \\nabla^\\infty$). This ensures that the distance functions $d_{g_i}$ converge uniformly to $d_{g_\\infty}$, and the set of geodesic loops at $p$ for $g_i$ converges to the set for $g_\\infty$. Consequently, the length of the shortest geodesic loop $L_{g_i}(p)$ converges to $L_{g_\\infty}(p)$.\nSince both the conjugate radius and the shortest loop length converge for each $p$, their minimum, $\\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_i)_p$, converges to $\\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_\\infty)_p$.\nFinally, since $S^2$ is compact, this convergence is uniform over all $p \\in S^2$. The infimum of a uniformly convergent sequence of functions converges to the infimum of the limit function. Therefore,\n$$\\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_i) = \\inf_{p \\in S^2} \\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_i)_p \\to \\inf_{p \\in S^2} \\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_\\infty)_p = \\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_\\infty)$$\n\n### Part 4: Computation of the Limiting Injectivity Radius\n\nWe need to compute $\\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_\\infty)$. The metric $g_\\infty$ has constant sectional curvature $\\kappa_\\infty = \\frac{1}{4}$. A $2$-sphere with constant curvature $\\kappa$ is isometric to a standard sphere embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ of radius $R = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\nFor $\\kappa_\\infty = \\frac{1}{4}$, the radius is $R = 1/\\sqrt{1/4} = 2$.\nThe manifold $(S^2, g_\\infty)$ is a sphere of radius $R=2$. Due to the spherical symmetry, the injectivity radius is the same at every point. So we can compute it at any point, say the north pole $p$.\nThe geodesics starting from $p$ are the great circles passing through $p$.\nThe first conjugate points to $p$ along any geodesic are all located at the single antipodal point, $p_a$. The distance along any great circle arc from $p$ to $p_a$ is $\\pi R$. Thus, the conjugate radius is $i_c(p) = \\pi R$.\nThe shortest non-trivial geodesic loop starting and ending at $p$ is any great circle passing through $p$. The length of such a loop is the circumference of the great circle, which is $2\\pi R$. Thus, $L(p) = 2\\pi R$.\nThe injectivity radius at $p$ is\n$$\\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_\\infty)_p = \\min\\left(i_c(p), \\frac{1}{2} L(p)\\right) = \\min\\left(\\pi R, \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi R)\\right) = \\min(\\pi R, \\pi R) = \\pi R$$\nSince this is true for any point $p$, the injectivity radius of $(S^2, g_\\infty)$ is $\\pi R$.\nSubstituting the value $R=2$, we find the limiting injectivity radius:\n$$\\operatorname{inj}(S^2, g_\\infty) = \\pi \\times 2 = 2\\pi$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi}$$", "id": "3026763"}, {"introduction": "Having established a baseline with smooth convergence, we now confront the central theme of this chapter: geometric collapse, which is captured by the weaker notion of Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence.

This requires identifying a sequence of metrics satisfying three conditions:\n1.  The sectional curvatures of $(M, g_i)$ are uniformly bounded.\n2.  The sequence of metric spaces $(M, d_{g_i})$ converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to some limit metric space.\n3.  The sequence of metric tensors $g_i$ does not converge in the $C^0$ topology to a Riemannian metric on $M$. A tensor field is a Riemannian metric only if it is positive-definite at every point.\n\nWe will now analyze each option against these criteria.\n\n### Option A Analysis\n\nThe proposed example is $M=\\mathbb{T}^{2}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}/\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ with the sequence of metrics $g_{\\varepsilon}=dx^{2}+\\varepsilon^{2}\\,dy^{2}$ for $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.\n\n1.  **Sectional Curvature**: The metric $g_{\\varepsilon}$ is a flat metric on the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ for every $\\varepsilon > 0$. The sectional curvature is identically zero, $K_{g_\\varepsilon} \\equiv 0$. Thus, the sectional curvatures are uniformly bounded by $0$. This condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Gromov-Hausdorff Convergence**: The metric space $(\\mathbb{T}^2, d_{g_\\varepsilon})$ is a flat torus where the length of the cycle in the $x$-direction is $1$ and the length of the cycle in the $y$-direction is $\\varepsilon$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the torus \"collapses\" along the $y$-direction. The limit space is the unit circle $(\\mathbb{S}^1, dx^2)$, which can be identified with the $x$-cycle of the torus. The projection map $\\pi: (\\mathbb{T}^2, g_\\varepsilon) \\to (\\mathbb{S}^1, dx^2)$ defined by $\\pi(x,y) = x$ is a Riemannian submersion. The diameter of the fibers (the $y$-circles) is $\\varepsilon/2$, which tends to $0$.

The justification provided is correct.\n\n3.  **$C^0$ Convergence**: In the standard coordinates $(x,y)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\varepsilon}$ is represented by the matrix $G_\\varepsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\varepsilon^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the components of this matrix converge uniformly to the components of the matrix $G_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The limit $g_0$ is a well-defined $(0,2)$-tensor field. However, $g_0$ is degenerate because its determinant is $0$. It is not positive-definite, as for any non-zero tangent vector $v = v^y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, we have $g_0(v,v) = 0$. Therefore, $g_{\\varepsilon}$ does not converge in $C^0$ to a *Riemannian metric*. The justification is correct.\n\nConclusion for A: This option provides a correct example with a valid justification. All three conditions are met.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n### Option B Analysis\n\nThe proposed example is $M=\\mathbb{S}^{1}$ with the sequence of metrics $g_{k}=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\sin(2\\pi k x)\\right)\\,dx^{2}$ for $k \\to \\infty$. For $k>1$, $1+\\frac{1}{k}\\sin(2\\pi k x)>0$, so $g_k$ is a valid Riemannian metric.\n\n1.  **Sectional Curvature**: Since $M=\\mathbb{S}^1$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold, its sectional curvature is trivially $0$ for any metric. The condition of uniformly bounded sectional curvature is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Gromov-Hausdorff Convergence vs. $C^0$ Convergence**: The option claims that the metrics fail to converge in $C^0$. Let's test this. The $C^0$ convergence of $g_k$ to a limit metric $g_\\infty$ is equivalent to the uniform convergence of the coefficient functions $f_k(x) = 1+\\frac{1}{k}\\sin(2\\pi k x)$. The pointwise limit is clearly $f_\\infty(x) = 1$. Let's check for uniform convergence:\n$$\n\\|f_k - f_\\infty\\|_{C^0} = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{S}^1} \\left| \\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\sin(2\\pi k x)\\right) - 1 \\right| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{S}^1} \\left| \\frac{1}{k}\\sin(2\\pi k x) \\right| = \\frac{1}{k}.\n$$\nSince $\\|f_k - 1\\|_{C^0} = \\frac{1}{k} \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$, the sequence of functions $f_k$ converges uniformly to $f_\\infty=1$. Thus, the sequence of metrics $g_k$ converges in $C^0$ to the standard metric $g_\\infty = dx^2$ on $\\mathbb{S}^1$. The claim that the sequence does not converge in $C^0$ is false. The justification given, \"the rapid oscillation of the coefficients prevents uniform convergence\", is incorrect. While the derivatives $f_k'(x)=2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi k x)$ do not converge, this concerns $C^1$ convergence, not $C^0$ convergence. The amplitude of the oscillation of $f_k(x)$ itself is $\\frac{1}{k}$, which tends to zero, ensuring uniform convergence.\n\nConclusion for B: This option is incorrect because the sequence of metrics *does* converge in $C^0$ to a Riemannian metric.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n### Option C Analysis\n\nThe proposed example is $M=\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ with metrics $g_{\\varepsilon}=dx^{2}+\\left(1+\\varepsilon\\sin(2\\pi x)\\right)^{2}\\,dy^{2}$ for $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. For $|\\varepsilon|<1$, the metrics are Riemannian.\n\n1.  **Sectional Curvature**: The sectional curvature of this warped product metric is $K(\\partial_x, \\partial_y) = \\frac{4\\pi^2 \\varepsilon \\sin(2\\pi x)}{1+\\varepsilon\\sin(2\\pi x)}$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, $K \\to 0$ uniformly. Thus, for any small range of $\\varepsilon$ near $0$, the sectional curvature is uniformly bounded. This condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Gromov-Hausdorff Convergence vs. $C^0$ Convergence**: The option claims failure of $C^0$ convergence. Let's examine the metric tensor $g_\\varepsilon$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the component $(g_\\varepsilon)_{yy} = (1+\\varepsilon\\sin(2\\pi x))^2$ converges pointwise to $1$. Let's check for uniform convergence:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{T}^2} \\left| (1+\\varepsilon\\sin(2\\pi x))^2 - 1 \\right| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{T}^2} \\left| 2\\varepsilon\\sin(2\\pi x) + \\varepsilon^2\\sin^2(2\\pi x) \\right| \\leq 2|\\varepsilon| + \\varepsilon^2.\n$$\nSince $2|\\varepsilon| + \\varepsilon^2 \\to 0$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the convergence is uniform. The sequence of metrics $g_\\varepsilon$ converges in $C^0$ to the standard flat metric $g_0 = dx^2 + dy^2$, which is a Riemannian metric. The claim that the sequence fails to converge in $C^0$ is false. The justification given, \"because the coefficient of $dy^2$ depends on $x$\", is not a valid reason for failure of convergence.\n\nConclusion for C: This option is incorrect because the sequence of metrics *does* converge in $C^0$ to a Riemannian metric.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n### Option D Analysis\n\nThe proposed example is $M=\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ with the sequence of metrics $g_{\\varepsilon}=\\varepsilon^{2}(dx^{2}+dy^{2})$ for $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.\n\n1.  **Sectional Curvature**: The metric $g_{\\varepsilon}$ is a flat metric for every $\\varepsilon > 0$. The sectional curvature is identically zero, $K_{g_\\varepsilon} \\equiv 0$. The condition of uniformly bounded sectional curvature is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Gromov-Hausdorff Convergence**: The metric $d_{g_\\varepsilon}$ is simply $\\varepsilon$ times the standard flat metric on the torus. The diameter of $(\\mathbb{T}^2, d_{g_\\varepsilon})$ is $\\varepsilon \\cdot \\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{T}^2, d_{\\text{std}})$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the diameter of the space tends to $0$. Any sequence of compact metric spaces whose diameters tend to zero converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a single point. This is a valid collapsing scenario. The justification is correct.\n\n3.  **$C^0$ Convergence**: In standard coordinates, the metric tensor is given by the matrix $G_\\varepsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\varepsilon^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the components of this matrix converge uniformly to the components of the zero matrix $G_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The limit is the zero tensor field. The zero tensor is not positive-definite and therefore is not a Riemannian metric. Thus, the sequence $g_\\varepsilon$ does not converge in the $C^0$ sense *to a Riemannian metric*. The justification provided is correct.\n\nConclusion for D: This option provides a correct example with a valid justification. All three conditions are met.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nBoth options A and D correctly and justifiably show that GH convergence with bounded curvature is a weaker notion than $C^0$ convergence of metrics on a fixed manifold.

Bounded Curvature and Fiber Lengths**\n\nTo find the sectional curvatures, we use Cartan's structure equations. The given metric is $g_{\\varepsilon} = \\theta_{1}^{2}+\\theta_{2}^{2}+\\varepsilon^{2}\\,\\theta_{3}^{2}$. We define an orthonormal coframe $\\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\omega_3\\}$ by $\\omega_1=\\theta_1$, $\\omega_2=\\theta_2$, $\\omega_3=\\varepsilon\\theta_3$. The exterior derivatives are $d\\omega_1=0$, $d\\omega_2=0$, and $d\\omega_3 = \\varepsilon d\\theta_3 = \\varepsilon(\\theta_1 \\wedge \\theta_2) = \\varepsilon(\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2)$.\nFrom the first structure equation $d\\omega_i = -\\sum_j \\omega_{ij} \\wedge \\omega_j$, we solve for the connection 1-forms $\\omega_{ij}$ and find $\\omega_{12} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_3$, $\\omega_{13} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_2$, and $\\omega_{23} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_1$.\nUsing the second structure equation, $\\Omega_{ij} = d\\omega_{ij} + \\sum_k \\omega_{ik}\\wedge\\omega_{kj}$, we find the curvature 2-forms:\n- $\\Omega_{12} = d(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_3) + \\omega_{13}\\wedge\\omega_{32} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}(\\varepsilon \\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2) + (-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_2)\\wedge(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_1) = (-\\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{4})\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2 = -\\frac{3\\varepsilon^2}{4}\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2$.\n- $\\Omega_{13} = d(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_2) + \\omega_{12}\\wedge\\omega_{23} = 0 + (-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_3)\\wedge(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_1) = \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{4}\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_3$.\n- $\\Omega_{23} = d(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_1) + \\omega_{21}\\wedge\\omega_{13} = 0 + (\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_3)\\wedge(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\omega_2) = \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{4}\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_3$.\nThe sectional curvatures for the orthonormal planes are $K_{12} = -3\\varepsilon^2/4$, $K_{13} = \\varepsilon^2/4$, and $K_{23} = \\varepsilon^2/4$. Since $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1]$, all sectional curvatures are uniformly bounded, e.g., by $|K| \\le 3/4$.\nThe fibers of $\\pi: M \\to \\mathbb{T}^2$ are generated by the center of the Heisenberg group, which corresponds to the vector field $V = \\partial_z$. The length of the fiber is the length of the closed curve corresponding to one period of the lattice $\\Gamma$ in the $z$-direction, which is $\\int_0^1 ||\\partial_z||_{g_\\varepsilon} dt$. We compute $||\\partial_z||_{g_\\varepsilon}^2 = g_\\varepsilon(\\partial_z, \\partial_z) = \\theta_1(\\partial_z)^2 + \\theta_2(\\partial_z)^2 + \\varepsilon^2 \\theta_3(\\partial_z)^2 = 0^2 + 0^2 + \\varepsilon^2(1^2) = \\varepsilon^2$. Thus, $||\\partial_z||_{g_\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon$, and the fiber length is $\\varepsilon$. It shrinks proportionally to $\\varepsilon$.\n\n**2. Riemannian Submersion and Limiting Base Metric**\n\nA map is a Riemannian submersion if its differential preserves lengths of horizontal vectors. The vertical space $\\mathcal{V}$ is spanned by the fiber tangent vector $\\partial_z$. The horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}$ is its $g_\\varepsilon$-orthogonal complement. A vector $H=a\\partial_x+b\\partial_y+c\\partial_z$ is horizontal if $g_\\varepsilon(H, \\partial_z)=0$. This gives $c = \\frac{ay-bx}{2}$.\nThe horizontal lift of $\\partial_x$ on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ is a horizontal vector field $\\tilde{\\partial}_x$ on $M$ that projects to $\\partial_x$. This is $\\tilde{\\partial}_x = \\partial_x + \\frac{y}{2}\\partial_z$. Similarly, the horizontal lift of $\\partial_y$ is $\\tilde{\\partial}_y = \\partial_y - \\frac{x}{2}\\partial_z$.\nThe problem defines the base metric $g_\\varepsilon^{\\text{base}}$ by requiring these lifts to be orthonormal. Let's verify this property with the metric $g_\\varepsilon$. We need to write $g_\\varepsilon$ in coordinate components: $g_\\varepsilon = (1+\\frac{\\varepsilon^2y^2}{4})dx^2+(1+\\frac{\\varepsilon^2x^2}{4})dy^2+\\varepsilon^2dz^2 - \\varepsilon^2 y dx \\otimes_s dz + \\varepsilon^2 x dy \\otimes_s dz - \\frac{\\varepsilon^2xy}{2}dx \\otimes_s dy$.\n- $g_\\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\partial}_x, \\tilde{\\partial}_x) = g_{xx} + y g_{xz} + \\frac{y^2}{4}g_{zz} = (1+\\frac{\\varepsilon^2y^2}{4}) + y(-\\frac{\\varepsilon^2y}{2}) + \\frac{y^2}{4}(\\varepsilon^2) = 1$.\n- $g_\\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\partial}_y, \\tilde{\\partial}_y) = g_{yy} - x g_{yz} + \\frac{x^2}{4}g_{zz} = (1+\\frac{\\varepsilon^2x^2}{4}) - x(\\frac{\\varepsilon^2x}{2}) + \\frac{x^2}{4}(\\varepsilon^2) = 1$.\n- $g_\\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\partial}_x, \\tilde{\\partial}_y) = g_{xy} - \\frac{x}{2}g_{xz} + \\frac{y}{2}g_{yz} - \\frac{xy}{4}g_{zz} = (-\\frac{\\varepsilon^2xy}{4}) - \\frac{x}{2}(-\\frac{\\varepsilon^2y}{2}) + \\frac{y}{2}(\\frac{\\varepsilon^2x}{2}) - \\frac{xy}{4}(\\varepsilon^2) = 0$.\nThe horizontal lifts are indeed orthonormal for all $\\varepsilon$. By definition of an induced metric from a Riemannian submersion, $g_\\varepsilon^{\\text{base}}(\\partial_x, \\partial_x) = g_\\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\partial}_x, \\tilde{\\partial}_x) = 1$, etc. Thus, $g_\\varepsilon^{\\text{base}} = dx^2 + dy^2$ for all $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1]$.\nThe limiting base metric as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ is therefore also the standard flat metric on the 2-torus: $g_0^{\\text{base}} = dx^2+dy^2$.\n\n**3. Collapsing to the Flat Torus**\n\nWe have a sequence of 3-manifolds $(M, g_\\varepsilon)$ and a limit candidate, the 2-manifold $(\\mathbb{T}^2, g_0^{\\text{base}})$. This is a dimensional reduction, i.e., a collapse.\nThe conditions for Cheeger-Gromov collapsing are met:\n- The sectional curvatures are uniformly bounded.\n- The diameter of $(M,g_\\varepsilon)$ is uniformly bounded (the horizontal diameter is bounded by that of the flat torus, and the vertical distances are shrinking).\n- The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between $(M, g_\\varepsilon)$ and the base space $(\\mathbb{T}^2, g_0^{\\text{base}})$ is bounded by the maximal fiber diameter, which is $\\varepsilon/2$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, $d_{GH}((M, g_\\varepsilon), (\\mathbb{T}^2, g_0^{\\text{base}})) \\to 0$.\nThe limit space is $(\\mathbb{T}^2, dx^2+dy^2)$, which is a smooth Riemannian manifold (the flat torus). The O'Neill tensors provide a structural reason for the bounded curvature: the curvature of the total space is determined by the (flat) base, the (flat) fibers, and the twisting term $A_XY = \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]^\\mathcal{V}$, whose norm squared contributes to the curvature. This twisting is proportional to $\\varepsilon$, making its contribution to curvature $O(\\varepsilon^2)$.\n\n**4. Nilpotent Group Action**\n\nThe Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov theory predicts that collapse with bounded curvature is governed by a local isometric action of a nilpotent group whose orbits are small. In this case, the structure is global. The center of the Heisenberg group, $Z(\\mathbb{H})=\\{(0,0,z)|z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, acts on $\\mathbb{H}$ by left multiplication: $(0,0,z_0)\\cdot(x,y,z) = (x,y,z+z_0)$. This is translation in the $z$-direction, and the infinitesimal generator is $\\partial_z$. This action descends to an $S^1$ action on the quotient manifold $M$.\nThe vector field $\\partial_z$ is a Killing vector field for each metric $g_\\varepsilon$ (i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_{\\partial_z} g_\\varepsilon = 0$), because $g_\\varepsilon$ is constructed from left-invariant coforms, and the action is also left-invariant. More directly, the coordinate coefficients of $g_\\varepsilon$ do not depend on $z$. Thus, the $S^1$ action is by isometries for every $\\varepsilon$.\nThe orbits of this action are precisely the fibers of the fibration $\\pi: M \\to \\mathbb{T}^2$. As shown in Part 1, the length of these orbits is $\\varepsilon$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the orbits of this isometric group action shrink to zero length, providing the canonical mechanism for the collapse. The orbit space $M/S^1$ is the base space $\\mathbb{T}^2$, which is the Gromov-Hausdorff limit.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{dx^2 + dy^2}\n$$", "id": "3026779"}]}
